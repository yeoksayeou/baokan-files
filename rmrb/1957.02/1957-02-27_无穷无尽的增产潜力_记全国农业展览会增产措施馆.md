Endless Potential for Increased Production
    ——A Record of the Increased Production Measures Hall at the National Agricultural Exhibition
    By Our Correspondent Pei Guoxun
    China's agricultural productivity has been greatly liberated twice in just a few years: first, it broke free from the heavy dual shackles of imperialism and feudalism, and then it broke through the narrow cage of the small-scale peasant economy of scattered production. In these years, the growth rate of agricultural crop yields has truly been unprecedented in history. The total grain output in 1956 increased by 152.4 billion jin compared to 1949, exceeding the production target for the final year of the First Five-Year Plan—1957; the total cotton output in 1956 increased by 21.61 million dan compared to 1949, an increase of 13.52 million dan compared to the highest cotton output year before liberation;… Considering that there are not yet many chemical fertilizers and tractors, achieving such high yields can only be described as a “miracle.”
    How did this "miracle" occur? Has the potential for increased production already reached its limit? Can the yields of grain, cotton, and other crops be raised to the levels stipulated in the "National Agricultural Development Program" (draft) for 1967 as scheduled? The many large charts, photographs, and various objects in the Increased Production Measures Hall of the National Agricultural Exhibition provide convincing answers to these questions: The increased production in recent years is the result of leveraging the power of organization under the political and economic support of the working class, building water conservancy projects, increasing fertilizer application, reforming cropping systems, expanding the area of multiple cropping, improving farming techniques, and promoting advanced experiences. The potential in these areas is endless and has certainly not been exhausted in the past few years. The main basis for achieving the increased production levels stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program within eleven years still lies in making greater efforts in these areas.
    Vigorously developing farmland water conservancy and striving to expand the irrigated area are the most important measures for increasing agricultural production. People will understand the tremendous achievements, rich experiences, and development prospects in this area after visiting the Water Conservancy Hall of the exhibition. What people can learn in the Increased Production Measures Hall are several important measures besides farmland water conservancy.

    Inexhaustible Fertilizer Sources
    Farmers often say, "With water and manure, you don't need to ask anyone." This shows that increasing fertilizer application is the most important measure to guarantee increased production besides water conservancy. Charts in the Increased Production Measures Hall tell people: In 1952, the national fertilized area only accounted for 70% of the total cultivated area, but by 1956, it had expanded to 85%; the average fertilizer application per mu also increased from 1,500 jin in 1952 to 2,500 jin in 1956. This provided a strong material guarantee for the annual increase in the yields of grain, cotton, and other crops.
    However, some people currently believe that after collectivization, the fertilizer sources have been exhausted, and there is no more fertilizer to accumulate. Is this true? Look at the dozens of types of urban miscellaneous manure, sea fertilizer, miscellaneous cake fertilizer, mineral fertilizer, and grass ash displayed on the exhibition stands and in the tall glass cases in the Increased Production Measures Hall; and look at the charts and photos introducing the utilization of water surfaces, crop rows, barren slopes, and fallow fields to plant green manure crops such as water hyacinth, revolutionary grass, golden flower vegetables, *Amorpha fruticosa*, purple alfalfa, and sweet clover; as well as raising pigs to accumulate fertilizer... Can it be said that there is no fertilizer to accumulate? Can it be said that the fertilizer sources have been exhausted? The question is whether the superior conditions of collectivization can be used to develop fertilizer sources according to local conditions. As long as this can be done, the fertilizer sources are inexhaustible.
    Only paying attention to accumulating more fertilizer and not paying attention to preserving fertilizer and applying it rationally can also cause undue waste and prevent the fertilizer from fully exerting its effectiveness. The guide explained to people: If human excrement and urine are not stored properly, the nitrogen content will easily turn into gas and escape; then, the experience of Zhang Benzi from Mengjin County, Henan, in creating a tile urn-style thatched pool for preserving fertilizer was introduced, and the audience was invited to look at a model of this type of pool. Another guide introduced the experience of rational fertilization to the surrounding audience: The Luoyang Experimental Station adopted different methods to compare the fertilization of 1,500 jin per mu, with strip application increasing production by 84 jin per mu and broadcast application only increasing production by 20 jin per mu. It can be seen that rational fertilization can not only fully exert the effectiveness of the fertilizer but also improve crop yields.
    Liling County, Hunan, implemented the perennial fertilizer accumulation method of "Four Diligences and Eight Haves" (that is, diligent sweeping, diligent padding, diligent removal, diligent burning, cows have sheds, pigs have pens, fields have green manure, ponds are available in all seasons, manure has pools, ash has houses, people have toilets, and chickens and ducks have nests), which attracted people's attention. Because this county implemented this method, the average application of various fertilizers per mu of land throughout the year in 1956 was more than 200 dan, which was more than six times more than before liberation, and the yield also increased year by year. Although it suffered a long-term drought of more than 120 days last year, it still increased production by 7.1% compared to 1955.

    One Mu Used as Several Mu
    Relying on the power of collectivization, implementing the reform of the cropping system, and striving to expand the area of multiple cropping are also of great significance for increasing agricultural production. Charts and photos in the Increased Production Measures Hall show that as a result of the "Three Changes" (changing single-season rice to double-season rice, changing dry land to paddy fields, and changing wasteland to cultivated land) promoted in Jiangxi Province over the past four years, despite the fact that the province has suffered different water and drought disasters continuously over the past four years, it has still increased grain production by more than 1.03 billion jin.
    Charts and photos in the Increased Production Measures Hall also show that the multiple cropping area of land nationwide has increased significantly in recent years with the development of collectivization. The area south of the Five Ridges uses winter fallow fields to expand the planting of winter-sown crops; the area north of the Five Ridges and south of the Yangtze River uses autumn and winter fallow land to increase the planting of one season; the area north of the Yangtze River and south of the Yellow River, Qinling Mountains, and Bailong River implements two crops a year using winter fallow fields; the area north of the Yellow River, Qinling Mountains, and Bailong River and south of the Great Wall uses summer fallow land to increase the planting of autumn crops; and the area north of the Great Wall implements intercropping according to local conditions. Using these methods, the national multiple cropping index reached 141% in 1956.
    The audience was very interested in the achievements of Xingzi County, Jiangxi, in expanding the multiple cropping area, and they listened attentively to the guide's explanation. In the past, this county only planted one season of mid-season rice. After the mid-season rice was harvested, the fields were left fallow, and green manure, rapeseed, or wheat were planted in the winter. The yield per mu of one season of mid-season rice was only about 200 jin, and the highest was no more than 400 or 500 jin. Starting in 1952, the county changed to planting 1.1 mu of double-season rice, and by 1956, it had expanded to more than 94,000 mu, and the amount of increased production compared to one season of mid-season rice also increased from 430 jin in 1952 to 25.34 million jin in 1956. Therefore, this county has changed from a grain-deficient county to a surplus grain county.
    China has many fertile lands; however, there are also many lands with poor soil quality and low yields. Saline-alkali land alone accounts for more than 300 million mu, and there are also many red soils, low-lying areas, sandy lands... Naturally, it is not an easy task to transform these poor soils into good soils so that crops can grow well. However, this matter should not be regarded as too difficult to the point of not daring to take action. The charts and photos exhibited in the Increased Production Measures Hall show many typical examples of achieving significant results in soil improvement. The guide told the audience: In Tianjin Prefecture, Hebei Province, out of a total of 15.6 million mu of land, low-lying areas account for 9.3 million mu. According to statistics from the five years after liberation, a total of 35 million mu of crops were flooded, reducing grain production by 4 billion jin, which seriously affected the lives of the peasant masses. Starting in 1955, this prefecture began conducting experiments on the transformation of low-lying areas in Tuanbowa and other places, achieving good results. In 1956, relying on the strength of cooperatives, the area of transformed low-lying areas was further expanded to 4.44 million mu. Many culverts, canals, and embankments were built on these lands, and replanting work was promoted at the same time. Although it suffered an unprecedented flood last year, it still harvested more than 660 million jin of grain, an increase of three times compared to before the transformation. Not only did it no longer rely on the state to supply grain, but it also sold 35 million jin of grain to the state to support industrial construction. In the Kuitan Farm in Guangdong, the yield of rice per mu in 1950 was only 150 jin. After red soil improvement and other measures to increase production, the yield per mu reached 1,009 jin in 1955... Hearing this, people will naturally think: As long as it is a piece of land in our motherland, we can make it grow more useful things for the people of our country. As long as people can continuously reform the cropping system according to local conditions, strive to expand the multiple cropping area, and do their best to improve the soil, they can make one mu of land be used as several mu of land.

    Let Crops Grow More Vigorously
    There is a method that does not require a lot of additional costs but has a very significant effect on increasing production, which is to select improved varieties. An electric chart in the Increased Production Measures Hall shows that by 1956, improved rice varieties had been promoted to 44.5% of the rice planting area in our country, improved wheat varieties to 57.6%, and improved cotton varieties to 88.9%... The three improved varieties of Nant Rice, Bima No. 1 Wheat, and Dai Cotton alone have increased grain production by about 2.155 billion jin and cotton production by more than 850,000 dan for the country in recent years.
    Farmers and scientists are working hard and have already discovered and cultivated many excellent varieties. Photos record the scenes of Professor Zhao Hongzhang of Northwest Agricultural College, Professor Cai Xu of Beijing Agricultural University, and model worker Chen Yongkang working in the fields. Due to their efforts, some new varieties have been bred recently. The "51-93" sweet potato variety, for example, was cultivated by Zhang Bitai and other researchers, sweet potato breeding experts at the East China Agricultural Science Institute, after five years of hard work. This variety has a higher yield than "Victory No. 100," and the nutritional components it contains are also much richer than "Victory No. 100."
    Last year alone, twenty-three provinces and cities collected more than 77,000 varieties of various crops and selected many excellent varieties from them that could be promoted. More than 500 types of major improved varieties, farmer-bred varieties, and newly selected varieties that have been promoted are displayed here. In addition, hundreds of rare and precious varieties are also displayed. Among them are fragrant japonica rice, which has excellent rice quality and is known locally as "one family cooking rice and ten families smelling the fragrance"; Huai'er Valley from Wenjiang County, Sichuan, with three grains of rice in one grain of rice, good quality, and high rice yield; and "Beauty Face" peas from Yichang, Tianmen, and other counties in Hubei, with large grains, thin skins, and used to make high-quality powder. These are all valuable heritages left to us by our ancestors and are also a source for breeding better varieties.
    There are numerous varieties of crops in our country, and most of them have various excellent characteristics. As long as people pay attention to discovering them, cultivating them, and are good at using agricultural cooperatives' seed plots to propagate them and popularize them, the potential for increased production in this area is also endless.
    To make crops grow vigorously, you must first pay attention to selecting seeds; after the seeds have germinated and grown, they must also be well protected so that they are not harmed.
    The numerous types of crop diseases and insect pests have been or are being eliminated by us. The fact that locusts have not caused disasters in the past seven years is a major victory on the front line of preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests. A giant oil painting in the Increased Production Measures Hall shows that during the three years from 1950 to 1952, 130 million farmers were mobilized and organized to prevent and control various diseases and insect pests on more than 500 million mu of land, recovering crop losses equivalent to more than 30 billion jin of grain. This amount of grain can feed 60 million people for a year! The guide also told people: Since 1953, the state has supplied farmers with more and more pesticides and agricultural machinery for preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests year by year. In 1956 alone, the area using pesticides to prevent and control diseases and insect pests reached more than 400 million mu. Due to the vigorous implementation of disease and insect pest prevention and control work, the incidence of wheat smut in the spring wheat area of ​​Gansu Province has been reduced from 18.1% in 1950 to 1.23%, and the rice stem borer in Jiangxi Province has also been reduced from 10%-30% before liberation to the current 0.1%-0.2%, thereby greatly reducing disease and insect pest disasters. With the development of China's industrial construction, the state will support agricultural production with more and better pesticides and agricultural machinery, coupled with more extensive organization of the broad masses of agricultural cooperative members to actively prevent and control, all crop diseases and insect pests will continue to be eliminated, and the yield of affected crops will gradually be guaranteed.

    On the Road of Technical Transformation
    More than 190 new and old-style agricultural tools and agricultural machines displayed in the indoor and outdoor areas of the Increased Production Measures Hall attracted people's attention. In particular, the "rice transplanter" researched by the East China Agricultural Science Institute and other units magnetically attracted many viewers. Here are the ancient Tibetan plows, the new-style double-wheel double-furrow plows, and the modern tractor-drawn five-furrow plows. Although our country cannot yet produce tractors and old-style agricultural tools still play a major role in production, new-style animal-powered agricultural tools are gradually replacing old-style agricultural tools. In the seven years from 1950 to 1956, our country has promoted 1.93 million new-style walking plows (including improved plows), more than 1.5 million double-wheel double (single) furrow plows, 48,000 seeders... The area of ​​land cultivated with new-style walking plows and double-wheel double-furrow plows nationwide reached 180 million mu in 1956.
    Some people doubt: Can using a double-wheel double-furrow plow really improve yields? Some even say that China's agriculture can increase production only by implementing social transformation. With sufficient manpower, why pursue mechanization and implement technical transformation? Please look at the example introduced in a chart in the Increased Production Measures Hall entitled "Double-Wheel Double-Furrow Plow Increases Production More": In the same conditions, the "August 1st" Agricultural Cooperative in Jingchuan County, Gansu Province, harvested only 256 jin of wheat per mu when planting with old plows, while it harvested 316 jin of wheat per mu when planting with double-wheel double-furrow plows; the first agricultural cooperative in Chenyang District, Sheyang County, Jiangsu Province, produced 210 jin of cotton per mu when planting with old plows, while it produced 330 jin of cotton per mu when planting with double-wheel double-furrow plows... Negating its effectiveness with one word without actively promoting its use or researching and improving it according to local conditions can only be said to be conservative thinking at work.
    In fact, China's agriculture is moving forward step by step on the road of technical transformation. In addition to preliminary technical improvements—the use of new-style agricultural tools—giant charts and photos in the Increased Production Measures Hall also introduce the development of China's tractor stations and the area of cultivated land currently served. It shows people the prospects for the development of agricultural production in our country and also encourages people to move forward to tomorrow. How to both mechanize and maintain China's excellent tradition of intensive farming is, of course, a problem that still needs to be researched and solved with continued efforts; however, it is certainly not unsolvable.
    After visiting the Increased Production Measures Hall of the National Agricultural Exhibition, people naturally come to the conclusion that the potential for increased production in our country is endless and that most of the advanced measures for increased production and technological reforms promoted in recent years are correct. There are some people: When promoting advanced measures for increased production and technological reforms last year, they did not follow the mass line and vigorously promote them according to local conditions, but rather adopted bureaucratic and subjective methods to treat this work, resulting in reduced production in some places and causing dissatisfaction among some of the masses. Afterwards, they did not actively summarize the work, affirm the achievements, and learn from the lessons, but instead tied their hands and feet and even abandoned technological reforms. What is the correct way to do it? Please come to the National Agricultural Exhibition to take a good look!

    无穷无尽的增产潜力
    ——记全国农业展览会增产措施馆
    本报记者　裴国勋
    我国农业生产力在几年之内连续两次得到大解放：先打破了帝国主义势力和封建势力的沉重的双重枷锁，又突破了分散生产的小农经济制度的狭小的笼子。这几年，农作物的产量增长的速度真是历史上前所未有的。1956年的粮食总产量，比1949年增加了一千五百二十四亿斤，并且超过了第一个五年计划的最后一年——1957年的生产指标；1956年的棉花总产量，比1949年增加了二千一百六十一万担，比解放前棉花产量最高年份还增加了一千三百五十二万担；……在目前还没有较多的化学肥料和拖拉机的情况下，能达到这样高的产量，不能不说它是“奇迹”。
    这个“奇迹”是怎样出现的呢？增产是不是已经到顶了呢？能不能如期把粮食和棉花等产量提高到“全国农业发展纲要”（草案）规定的1967年的水平呢？全国农业展览会的增产措施馆的许多大幅图表、照片和各种各样的实物，对这些问题作了令人信服的回答：这几年的增产，是在工人阶级从政治上到经济上的支援下，发挥组织起来的力量，兴修水利、增施肥料、改革耕作制度、扩大复种面积、改进耕作技术、推广先进经验的结果。这些方面的潜力是无穷无尽的，决不是在过去的几年里已经挖掘完了。十一年内达到全国农业发展纲要规定的增产水平的主要根据，仍然在于从这些方面作更大的努力。
    大力兴修农田水利，努力扩大灌溉面积，是增加农业生产的最重要的措施。在这个方面的巨大的成就，丰富的经验和发展的远景，人们看了展览会的水利馆以后就会了解。人们在增产措施馆可以了解到的是农田水利以外的几项重要措施。
    肥源挖不尽
    农民常说：“有水有粪，不用问人。”可见增施肥料，是水利之外保证增产的最重要的措施。增产措施馆的图表告诉人们：1952年全国施肥面积只占总耕地面积的70％，到1956年就扩大了85％；一般每亩施肥量也从1952年的一千五百斤，增加到1956年的二千五百斤。这就使粮食、棉花等作物的产量的逐年提高得到了有力的物质保证。
    但是，目前有些人认为，合作化以后，肥源挖尽了，没有什么肥料可积了。这是事实吗？请看：增产措施馆的展品台上和高大的玻璃框内陈列出的几十种城市杂肥、海肥、杂饼肥、矿质肥、草灰等；再看：图表和照片中介绍的利用水面、作物行间、荒坡隙地、休闲田可以分别种植水浮莲、革命草、金花菜、紫穗槐、紫云英、草木樨等绿肥作物；还有养猪积肥……。这能说没有什么肥料可积了吗？这能说肥源挖尽了吗？问题是在于能不能利用合作化的这一优越条件，去因地制宜地发掘肥源。只要能这样作，肥源是无穷无尽的。
    只注意多积肥料，不注意保肥和合理施肥，也会造成不应有的浪费和不能充分发挥肥料的效能。讲解员在向人们说明：人粪尿如果贮存不好，其中所含的氮素就容易变成气体跑掉；接着，就介绍了河南孟津县张本资创造的采用瓦瓮式茅池保肥的经验，并请观众看了这种茅池的模型。另一个讲解员在向围拢来的观众介绍合理施肥的经验：河南洛阳试验站采取不同的方法每亩对比施肥一千五百斤的结果，条施的每亩增产八十四斤，撒施的每亩只增产二十斤。可见合理施肥，既能充分发挥肥料的效能，又能提高作物的产量。
    湖南醴陵县实行“四勤八有”（即勤扫、勤垫、勤出、勤烧，牛有栏、猪有圈、田有绿肥、四季有氹、粪有池、灰有屋、人有厕所、鸡鸭有窝）的常年积肥办法，引起了人们的注意。这个县由于实行了这样的方法，1956年全年平均每亩田施各种肥料二百多担，比解放前增加了六倍还多，产量也逐年提高。去年虽遭到一百二十多天的长期干旱，仍然比1955年增产7.1％。
    一亩地当几亩用
    依靠合作化的力量，实行耕作制度的改革，努力扩大复种面积，对于增加农业生产来说，意义也是很大的。增产措施馆的图表和照片表明：江西省四年来推行“三变”（一季稻变两季稻、旱地变水田、荒地变熟地）的结果，尽管这个省四年来连续遭受不同的水旱灾害，仍增产粮食十亿三千多万斤。
    增产措施馆的图表和照片还表明：全国土地的复种面积，随着合作化的发展，几年来有了明显的扩大。五岭以南地区利用冬闲田扩种冬播作物；五岭以北长江以南地区利用秋闲和冬闲田地增种一季；长江以北黄河秦岭白龙江以南地区利用冬闲田地实行一年两熟；黄河秦岭白龙江以北长城以南地区利用夏闲地增种秋季作物；长城以北地区因地制宜地实行套种。采用这些办法，1956年全国的复种指数已达到141％。
    观众们对江西星子县扩大复种面积的成就很感兴趣，他们聚精会神地倾听着讲解员的讲解。这个县过去只种一季中稻，中稻收获后就把田闲起来，到冬季再种上绿肥、油菜或小麦。一季中稻的每亩产量只有二百斤左右，最高也不过四、五百斤。从1952年开始改种一亩一分双季稻，到1956年就扩大到九万四千多亩，比一季中稻的增产数量也从1952年的四百三十斤提高到1956年的二千五百三十四万斤。因此，这个县已由缺粮县变成了余粮县。
    我国有许多肥美的沃土；可是也有不少土地质量不好，产量很低，光是盐碱地就有三亿亩以上，此外，还有不少红壤、洼地、沙地……。要把这些不好的土壤改成好土壤，使农作物能得到良好的成长，自然不是一件轻而易举的事。然而也不可把这件事看得十分艰难，以至不敢动手。增产措施馆展出的图表、照片中，就出现了不少改良土壤取得显著成效的典型事例。讲解员告诉观众：河北省天津专区共有一千五百六十万亩土地、洼地即占去九百三十万亩。据解放后五年来的统计，共淹庄稼三千五百万亩，减产粮食四十亿斤，严重地影响了农民群众的生活。从1955年起，这个专区就开始在团泊洼等地进行了洼地改造的试验，取得了良好成绩。1956年依靠合作社的力量进一步扩大改造洼地面积四百四十四万亩，在这些土地上修筑了很多涵闸、渠道、围埝等水利工程，同时推行改种工作。去年虽遭空前大水灾，仍收获粮食六亿六千多万斤，比改造前增产了三倍，不仅不再依靠国家供应粮食，还出卖给国家三千五百万斤粮食，来支持工业建设。广东葵潭农场，1950年每亩水稻只产一百五十斤，进行了红壤改良和其它增产措施后，1955年每亩就产到一千零九斤……。人们听到这里，自然就会想到：只要是我们祖国的一块土地，我们都能使它为我国人民生长出更多有用的东西。只要人们能因地制宜地不断进行耕作制度的改革，努力扩大复种面积，尽力改良土壤，就能使一亩地顶几亩地用。
    让作物更健壮地生长
    有一种不需要增加很多成本而对于增加生产却有很显著的效果的方法，就是选用良种。增产措施馆的一张电动图表显现出：水稻良种到1956年，已推广到我国水稻种植面积的44.5％，小麦良种是57.6％，棉花良种是88.9％……。仅已推广的南特号水稻、碧蚂一号小麦和岱字棉三个良种，几年来就为国家增产粮食约二十一亿五千五百万斤，皮棉八十五万多担。
    农民和科学家们辛勤地劳动着，并且已经发掘和培育出不少的优良品种。照片纪录了西北农学院教授赵洪璋、北京农业大学教授蔡旭、劳动模范陈永康等在田间工作中的情形。由于他们的努力，最近又有一些新的品种育成。像“51—93”甘薯品种，就是华东农业科学研究所甘薯选种专家张必泰等研究人员，经过五年的辛勤劳动培育出来的。这个品种，比“胜利百号”产量高，而且所含的营养成份也比“胜利百号”丰富的多。
    去年仅二十三个省、市征集到的各种作物品种，就有七万七千多个，并从中评选出不少的可以推广的优良品种。这里陈列着五百多种已经推广的主要良种、农家良种和新选育出的品种。另外，还陈列出上百种的稀有和名贵的品种。其中有米质优良、在当地有“一家煮饭十家香”之称的香粳稻；一粒谷中有三个米粒、质量好、出饭多的四川温江县的怀儿谷；粒大、皮薄，用以制作上等粉的湖北宜昌、天门等县的“美人脸”豌豆等等。这些，都是我们祖先留给我们的宝贵遗产，也是培育更好的品种的源泉。
    我国农作物的品种是为数众多的，而且大多具有各种各样的优良特性，只要人们注意发掘它、培育它，并善于运用农业社的种子地繁殖它、普及它，这方面的增产潜力，也同样是无穷无尽的。
    要使作物健壮地生长，先要注意选种；种子发了芽，成长起来了，还要好好保护，使它不受侵害。
    种类繁多的农作物病虫害，已经或正在被我们消灭。七年来，没有让飞蝗成灾，就是防治病虫害战线上的一大胜利。增产措施馆的一幅巨型油画表明：在1950年到1952年的三年期间，先后发动和组织了一亿三千万农民，在五亿多亩土地上防治了各种病虫害，挽回农作物的损失约折合粮食三百多亿斤。这笔粮食，可供六千万人吃一年！讲解员还告诉人们：从1953年开始，国家一年比一年多地供应农民以防治病虫害的农药、农械。仅1956年一年，用农药防治病虫害的面积已达四亿亩以上。由于防治病虫害工作的大力进行，甘肃省春小麦区的腥黑穗病发病率已从1950年的18.1％压低到1.23％，江西省的水稻螟害亦由解放前的10％—30％压低到现在的0.1％—0.2％，从而大大减轻了病虫灾害。随着我国工业建设的发展，国家将以更多更好的农药、农械来支援农业生产，再加上更广泛地组织广大农业社社员积极防治，所有作物病虫害将不断被消灭，受害作物的产量也将逐步得到保障。
    在技术改造的道路上
    在增产措施馆的室内和室外，陈列的一百九十多部新、旧式农具和农业机器，引起了人们的注意。特别是华东农业科学研究所等单位研究出的“水稻插秧机”，磁铁般地吸引着许多观众。这里有古老的西藏犁，也有新式的双轮双铧犁，还有现代化的拖拉机牵引的五铧犁。尽管目前我国还不能生产拖拉机，旧式农具在生产上还起着很大作用，然而新式的畜力农具正在逐步代替着旧式农具。1950年到1956年的七年中，我国已推广了新式步犁（包括改良犁）一百九十三万部，双轮双（单）铧犁一百五十多万部，播种机四万八千部，……。全国用新式步犁和双轮双铧犁耕地的面积，在1956年已达到一亿八千万亩。
    有一些人怀疑：使用双轮双铧犁耕地究竟能不能提高产量，甚至说我国农业只实行社会改造就可以增产了，有的是人力，何必再追求机械化、实行技术改造呢？请看增产措施馆的一幅“双轮双铧犁耕地增产多”的图表所介绍的事例吧：甘肃省径川县“八一”农业社在相同的条件下，用旧犁耕地种的小麦，每亩只收二百五十六斤，用双轮双铧犁耕地种的小麦，每亩就收到了三百一十六斤；江苏射阳县陈洋区第一农业社用旧犁种的棉花，每亩产二百一十斤，用双轮双铧犁种的棉花，每亩就产到三百三十斤。……不积极推广使用或根据当地具体情况研究改进就一口否定它的功效，就只能说是保守思想在作怪。
      事实上，我国农业正在技术改造的道路上，一步一步前进着。除了初步的技术改进——使用新式农具以外，增产措施馆的巨幅图表和照片，还介绍了我国拖拉机站的发展情况，以及目前服务的耕地面积。它向人们展示了我国农业生产发展的远景，也鼓舞了人们向明天迈进。如何既要机械化又能保持我国精耕细作的优良传统，固然是一个尚待继续努力研究解决的问题；可是，这决不是不能解决的。
    看了全国农业展览会的增产措施馆，人们很自然地得出了这样的结论：我国的增产潜力是无穷无尽的；几年来推行的先进的增产措施和技术改革绝大部分是正确的。有这样一些人：他们在去年推行先进的增产措施和技术改革的时候，不是走群众路线、因地制宜地去大力推行，而是采取官僚主义的、主观主义的方法来对待这个工作，结果在一些地方造成了减产的结果，引起了一些群众的不满。事后，他们又不积极总结工作，肯定成绩，吸取教训，而是束手束脚，甚至放弃了技术改革。究竟怎样做才是正确的呢？请他们到全国农业展览会来好好看看吧！
