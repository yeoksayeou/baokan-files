    A Red Star on the Prairie	By our correspondent Lin Mo
      The First Pastoral Cooperative

    From Chifeng, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, I took a horse-drawn carriage to visit the Hongxing Pastoral Production Cooperative in Ongniud Banner.

    I had heard long ago that the Hongxing Cooperative was one of the earliest livestock production cooperatives established in the country, and that it had opened up a happy path to socialism for the herdsmen through its own practice. How is this cooperative doing? What kind of life are the herdsmen living? Along the way, I had many imaginations and guesses about the situation there, and I was eagerly looking forward to reaching my destination.

    For the first two days, we traveled in agricultural areas, and we could often see forests and villages. On the third day, villages, trees, and cultivated land disappeared. The road was full of undulating hills and wide meadows, with cattle and sheep grazing in the meadows—this was the pastoral area.

    On the evening of the third day, we reached the end of a large meadow, bypassed a ridge, and suddenly a village appeared at the foot of the mountain opposite: in front were verdant trees, and behind was a row of neat houses, the glass windows of which sparkled in the setting sun. I was staring intently when the coachman said, "Here we are, this is the Hongxing Cooperative."

    In the evening, the cooperative cadres introduced me to their cooperative. —This cooperative has been established for only five years, and the lives of the herdsmen have undergone fundamental changes. In the past, they lived in the grasslands in groups of two or three families, all alone. Since ancient times, herdsmen have eaten mutton and worn sheepskin, relying entirely on animal husbandry for their livelihood. Today, they have established new villages on the grasslands, planted trees, cultivated orchards and vegetable gardens, opened up feed bases, and grown grain, vegetables, and feed, taking root in the land. They have improved the feeding management and grazing techniques of livestock, carried out various basic construction projects on the pasture, and have the conditions to overcome natural disasters, so that the number of livestock has increased year by year, and the breeds have been improved. The children of the cooperative attend school, and adults are actively learning culture. They also have their own amateur theater troupe. The members talked about the houses they live in, the food they eat, the clothes they wear, the cultural entertainment, the surrounding natural scenery, the appearance of the livestock, and even the entire world here, in the feeling of their lives, which are very different from the past.

          New Village

    The next day, Baiyin Menghe, the deputy director of the cooperative, led me to visit their new village. We walked past rows of new houses. "These were all built after we established the cooperative," Baiyin Menghe explained to me: "Originally, only two families lived here. Of the twenty-two households in our cooperative, twenty households moved in from other places. In the past, many people lived in 'earth mounds' (a kind of circular small earthen house similar to a Mongolian yurt). Now every family lives in a new house."

    "Moving and building houses as soon as you established the cooperative, won't it increase the burden on the members?" I asked him.

    "No, building these adobe houses doesn't cost much. The mud and water work is all done by the members exchanging work with each other. When a family builds a house, they only need to take care of everyone's meals and buy some wood. Building two rooms is enough to sell two cows at that time. Two cows are nothing to us herdsmen!"

    We walked into a member's home. A middle-aged woman was sitting on the kang doing needlework, and an old grandmother was spinning yarn next to her. The sunlight shone on the large white paper windows, and the room was bright and warm. On the cupboard opposite the kang, there was also a kind of potted plant unique to this place (many members' homes have this thing): a large tile pot with green garlic sprouts, water onions, and clusters of light blue and milky white radish flowers. This thing brought youthful vitality to the room and also showed the owner's mood.

    The hostess of this family told me that before they joined the cooperative, they lived in the sand nest in the north. A family of five lived in an "earth mound". There was only one neighbor nearby, that family only had a father and son, who went out to graze sheep early every morning and didn't return until dark. She said that it was impossible to visit anyone at that time.

      Baiyin Menghe led me into the cooperative's club. This is three spacious new houses, with snow-white walls and bright glass windows. In the middle of the room, a table was placed with some Mongolian books and newspapers, and colorful banners were hanging on the walls. The members hold meetings, learn culture, and the amateur theater troupe rehearses programs here. The bursts of singing and string music I heard the other night came from here. A few days later, I finally had the opportunity to see the performance of the amateur theater troupe. More than a dozen young men and women, wearing bright and colorful national costumes, sang moving Mongolian songs and dances. The young and old men and women of the cooperative and the nearby herdsmen sat around there, watching with fascination.

    Coming out of the club, we went to see the cooperative's orchard. A garden of more than ten mu, surrounded by a solid windbreak fence. In the garden, half of it is planted with various fruit trees such as jujube, apricot, red fruit, and grapes, all of which were newly cultivated that year; the other half is planted with hundreds of small poplar trees, which have been planted successively in recent years.

    Baiyin Menghe walked into the poplar tree row, reached out and pulled down a branch, touched a green leaf, and stood there meaningfully and said: "Look, they have all grown up! —Speaking of planting these trees, in the first year, even I didn't believe they could survive. Because of this, I also had a quarrel with our cooperative director Comrade Genden. I said: 'Our ancestors have never planted trees, can you grow them?' He said: 'That's not their fault, it's just that there was no good government to lead them at that time.' Some members said, 'Look at this barren sandy beach, won't a gust of wind blow the trees away.' He said; 'We are going to plant trees to control this wind and sand!' Our Comrade Genden is a party member, has received more education, and sees things more far-sightedly. After we established the cooperative, he came back from a meeting in the banner and said: 'Now that we have built this row of houses and become a village, we should settle down and establish a career here, and we should also plant some trees like in the agricultural area to shelter from the wind and sand!' He said it, but no one paid attention to it. Later, the agricultural and forestry section of the banner government helped us get some seedlings, and Comrade Genden found a few enthusiastic members to plant them first. The second year, most of them survived. When the working comrades who came from above saw it, they praised and educated us, saying that planting trees on the grassland and fighting against wind and sand is a remarkable thing. The members were moved by the words, and they planted more and more every year. Until last year, Chairman Mao called on us to green the whole country. Our cooperative planned it and first started this garden, and we will plant trees on the mountains around here year by year in the future."

          On the Pasture

    I went to the pasture with Bao Yushan, the resident cadre of the Hongxing Pastoral Cooperative, on horseback. Not far out of the village, we went into the sand nest. The Hongxing Cooperative's pasture is in this sand nest. The pasture grass grows sparsely and short, but the quality of the grass is still relatively good. This pasture is far worse than the Hulunbuir or Xilingol grasslands. The pasture grass there is like a boundless wheat field on the North China Plain in summer, where grass can be harvested and grazed everywhere, and the livestock can't eat it all.

    In such a sand nest pasture, the Hongxing Cooperative can raise livestock very well. In the three production years after the establishment of the cooperative (from 1952 to 1955), the livestock of the fifteen old members of the cooperative increased from 848 to 1,946, an increase of 1.29 times. Such a rate of development is rare in the country's animal husbandry industry. The production performance in 1956 was equally excellent: the cooperative's 172 ewes produced 189 lambs (10% of the ewes produced twins), 12 died, and the net reproduction rate was 109%; 534 female goats produced 596 lambs (12% of the female goats produced twins), 12 died, and the net reproduction rate was 110%.

    The Hongxing Cooperative attaches great importance to the improvement of livestock breeds. In the five years after the establishment of the cooperative, 90% of their sheep have been improved into semi-fine wool sheep, and some of the cattle have also been improved into improved dairy cows. The value of milk and wool produced by each improved breed of livestock is several times that of local livestock.

    The wool cut from the improved sheep is fine and soft, like cotton, and can be woven into gabardine and woolen cloth. A second-generation improved sheep can cut seven or eight catties of wool every year, worth sixteen or seventeen yuan. The wool from local sheep is thick and hard, and can only be used to make felt, weave carpets, and coarse woolen cloth; a sheep can only cut two or three catties of wool a year, and only sells for two or three yuan.

    We got off our horses and walked into the sheep pen. Sarenqimuge, who was responsible for raising young livestock, was about to artificially feed the lambs. She gathered a little lamb and gently stroked its fluffy curly hair. The lamb mooed and kissed her hand, bumping against her body with its head. "Are you hungry? Don't worry, I'll give you something to eat soon!" Sarenqimuge said, and picked up the feeding bottle to feed it. The lamb wagged its tail happily and stood there chirping and chirping.

    "Is this kind of lamb more difficult to raise than local livestock?" I asked Sarenqimuge.

    "No, it's not difficult as long as you understand its temperament," she said: "This kind of lamb has short hair when it is born and is afraid of freezing, so it has to stay in a warm shed for a few days before it can be released; when it grows up, it likes to be clean and cannot be stained with mud or lice..." She talked about how this kind of sheep should drink water, how to graze, and how to take care of it from childhood to adulthood.

      Sarenqimuge is an active member of the Communist Youth League in the cooperative. She usually likes to talk and make noise. When she talks about her beloved livestock, she talks even more.

    After Sarenqimuge fed the lambs and cleaned the sheep pen, she led us to the cattle pen to see the improved cattle. She opened the pen door and went in. A group of calves ran to her happily and actively. There were spotted Dutch cows and fiery red shorthorn cattle. Each of them had shiny fur and clean hooves and legs. Sarenqimuge walked to them, grabbed a little red bull and said, "Look, it's the tallest, but it was born the latest in this group."

    "Is this the second-generation shorthorn bull?" Bao Yushan asked. Sarenqimuge nodded.

    Bao Yushan walked over and carefully measured: "It's true, each generation is stronger than the last!"

    This calf is tall and strong, and its waist and legs are particularly thick. Its mother was the first-generation improved cow born in 1953, and was bred in the third year. For its delivery, Sarenqimuge and her husband Mantega had been waiting for several nights in a row. Because this was the first calf produced by their improved cow. When the calf was born before dawn, Mantega immediately went to the cooperative to report the good news.

    "Is the mother cow's milk plentiful?"

    "Very plentiful, very plentiful!" Sarenqimuge said happily, gesturing: "She can squeeze out half a small bucket every day, plus what the calf eats, it's enough to have seven or eight catties. —This is her first birth, after the third birth, she will produce more milk!" From the proud expression in her speech, it can be seen that Sarenqimuge feels proud and honored to be responsible for raising improved livestock. Indeed, she did not betray the trust of all the members. In 1956, the 172 ewes she raised bred and survived 176 lambs, exceeding the contracted quota by 20%; more than 20 improved calves she raised were all survived by her meticulous care. Now they have more than 500 improved sheep and more than 80 improved cattle.

          Seeds

    I went to visit an old herdsman who knew how to grow vegetables. He was not at home and had gone to tidy up the garden. His son Han Ruilin was taking some paper packets from the box, and spreading them out on the kang one packet at a time. It turned out that a neighbor was asking him for vegetable seeds.

    "Oh my, you have a treasure trove!" said the neighbor standing by the kang.

    "Where did you get so many, what are they all?" Seeing so many seeds, I couldn't help but be surprised. He opened a paper packet and said: "This is a kind of yellow tomato. It was planted for the first time last year, and it produced a lot and was big. Also, this kind of cucumber is not bad," he opened another paper packet and recommended to the neighbor: "Didn't you get a share of the cucumbers we planted last year? Each one weighed no less than half a catty." He pinched out a handful of cucumber seeds and wrapped them up. He also took out a small cloth bag and said: "There are also watermelon seeds, do you want a few?"

    "I want them, but I'm afraid I won't grow them well."

    "It doesn't matter, let's study together, we will be able to grow them in a year or two."

    "Have you grown watermelons before?" I asked.

    "Oh, the watermelons we grow here are very sweet! It's not very good to grow anything else on the sandbags in the back, but good watermelons grow!"

    Han Ruilin was originally a staff member of a state agency. Because he was ill and needed long-term recuperation, he saw that a cooperative had been established in his hometown and everyone lived together in a lively atmosphere, which was no longer as desolate and monotonous as in the past, so he returned home to live there for a long time. When he was working in the agency, he liked to grow flowers and vegetables. When he returned home, he collected some seeds everywhere, preparing to grow some vegetables and fruits at home to nourish and exercise his body. Unexpectedly, this matter had a great impact on the village. The cooperative wanted to expand the vegetable garden, and the herdsmen also wanted to learn how to grow vegetables. This gradually surpassed his personal interest and became a mass undertaking. He unknowingly became more and more energetic about this matter.

    He introduced me to those seeds, and then led me to see the cooperative's vegetable garden.

    The vegetable plots are square, flat, and meticulous. The members are watering and fertilizing. From their careful and gentle appearance when they work, it can be seen that they are very skilled in this kind of labor.

    The vegetable garden is only four or five mu in size, but it takes a lot of effort to tidy it up. A solid fence must be built around it to block livestock and prevent wind and sand. Even so, every spring, a layer of flying sand a foot thick has to be removed and good soil replaced, which requires a lot of work.

    The old man Sanbulizhabu, who first planted vegetables here, is one of the two original old residents here. This old man had been to the agricultural area in his early years, carefully observed how Han Chinese farmers grow vegetables, and brought back several kinds of vegetable seeds from outside, and tried to plant them himself. At that time, he only dug up a piece of land the size of a kang mat at the door of his house and planted some onions, garlic, and potatoes, not only for himself to eat, but also to see something rare. But sometimes a sandstorm would bury this small garden.

    After the cooperative was established, everyone valued Sanbulizhabu's ability to grow vegetables very much. The cooperative helped him choose a good place sheltered from the wind and facing the sun, dug a good well, prepared a set of utensils, and assigned him two assistants, so that he could concentrate on growing vegetables.

    This small vegetable garden has been expanding year by year, and the variety of vegetables has been increasing year by year. Some of the nearby herdsmen came to ask for vegetables to eat, and some came to visit. The Hongxing Pastoral Cooperative's vegetable growing business became famous within a hundred miles. When the vegetables came down in the summer, the members couldn't finish eating them. They also drove large carts to distant markets to sell them. When those big cucumbers, tomatoes, tender cowpeas, and purple eggplants appeared in the market of Wuduntaohai, where the banner people's government is located, people on the street surrounded them to see something rare. When everyone learned that these were vegetables grown by herdsmen, they praised them even more.

    草原上的一颗红星	本报记者　林沫
      第一个牧业社
    从内蒙古自治区的赤峰坐上马车，我去访问翁牛特旗的红星牧业生产合作社。
    早就听说，红星社是全国建立最早的一个畜牧业生产合作社，它以自己的实践，为牧民们开辟了一条走向社会主义的幸福之路。这个合作社办得怎么样呢？牧民们过着什么样的生活？一路上，我对那里的情形有许多想像和推测，急切地盼望着到达目的地。
    头两天，我们行走在农业区，还可以经常看到树林和村庄。到第三天，村庄、树木、耕地都看不见了，一路上尽是高低起伏的山丘和宽阔的草甸子，草甸子里放牧着牛羊——这里是牧业区了。
    第三天傍晚，我们走到一片大草甸子的尽头，绕过一道岗子，对面山脚下忽而露出一个村庄来：前面有碧绿的树林，后边是一片整齐的房屋，房子的玻璃窗在夕阳照耀下闪闪发光。我正凝神注视，车夫说：“到了，这就是红星社。”
    晚上，社干部们向我介绍了他们的合作社。——这个社建立起来不过五年，牧民们的生活已经发生了根本性的变化。过去，他们三两户人家在一起，孤孤零零地生活在草原上。自古以来，牧民们吃羊肉，穿羊皮，完全靠畜牧业为生。如今，他们在草原上建立了新村，栽了树木，培植了果园和菜园，开辟了饲料基地，种出了粮食、蔬菜和饲料，在土地上扎了根。他们改进了牲畜的饲养管理和放牧技术，在牧场上进行了各种基本建设，有条件战胜自然灾害，使牲畜头数逐年上升，并且改良了品种。合作社的儿童们上了学，成年人都在积极学文化。他们还有自己的业余剧团。社员们谈起来，从他们住的房子，吃的饭菜，穿的衣服，文化娱乐，周围的自然景色，牲畜的模样，甚至连这儿的整个天地，在他们生活的感觉中，都和过去大不相同了。
          新　村
    第二天，合作社的副主任白音孟和领着我参观了他们的新村。我们走过一排排的新房子。“这都是我们建社以后盖的。”白音孟和向我解释着：“原先这地方只住着两家人，咱们合作社的二十二户人，有二十户都是从别处搬来的。过去很多人都住‘土崩子’（一种类似蒙古包的圆形小土屋），如今家家都住上新房子了。”
    “你们一建社就搬家，盖房子，不会增加社员的负担吗？”我问他。
    “不，像我们盖这土坯房子，花不了多少钱。泥水活都是社员互相换工作的。谁家盖房子，只需管大家吃饭，买些木料，盖两间房，当时卖两条牛就够了。两条牛，在咱们牧民说来不算什么呀！”
    我们走进一个社员家里。一个中年妇女坐在炕上做活计，旁边一个老奶奶在捻毛线。阳光照着雪白的纸糊的大窗户，屋子里明亮、温暖。炕对面的立柜上，还放着一种这儿特有的盆景（很多社员家都养着这东西）：一个大瓦盆里长着绿油油的蒜苗、水葱和一簇簇开着淡青、乳白色的萝卜花。这东西给这间屋带来了青春的生气，也说明了主人的心情。
    这家女主人告诉我，她们在加入合作社以前，是住在北边的沙窝子里，一家五口住着一个“土崩子”。附近只有一家邻居，那家只有父子两个，每天一早出去放羊，到天黑才回来。她说，那时候要想串个门也没处去。
      白音孟和领着我走进合作社的俱乐部。这里是三间宽敞的新房子，雪白的墙壁，明亮的玻璃窗，中间一张桌上放着些蒙文书报，墙上挂着五颜六色的锦旗。社员们在这里开会、学文化，业余剧团在这里排演节目。头天夜里我听到的一阵阵歌声和丝弦的弹唱，就是从这里发出的。几天以后，我终于有机会看到业余剧团的演出。十几个青年男女，穿着鲜艳多彩的民族服装，演唱着动人的蒙古歌舞。合作社的男女老少和附近的牧民，围坐在那里，看得入迷。
    从俱乐部出来，我们去看合作社的果树园。一块十几亩大的园子，四周扎着结实的挡风篱笆。园子里，一半栽着枣、杏、红果、葡萄等各种果树，这些都是当年新培植的；另一半栽着几百株小杨树，这些是近几年陆续栽的。
    白音孟和走到杨树行里，伸手拉下一根树枝，摸着一片绿油油的叶子，站在那里意味深长地说：“你看，居然一棵棵都长大了！——说起栽这些树，头一年，连我也不相信能栽活。因为这事，我还跟咱们的社主任根登同志吵过嘴。我说：
  ‘咱们祖祖辈辈也没栽过树，你就能栽活啦？’他说：‘那不怨他们，只怪那时候没有好政府来领导。’有的社员说‘看这荒沙滩，一场风还不就把树刮跑了。’他说；‘我们就是要栽起树木来，治这风沙！’咱们的根登同志是党员，受的教育多，啥事情都看得远些。我们建社以后，他从旗里开会回来就说：‘咱们如今盖下这一片房屋，成了村子，要在这里安家立业，也该像农业区那样，栽些树木，好遮避风沙呀！’他说是说，可是谁也不理这事。后来，旗政府的农林科，帮咱弄来些树苗子，根登同志就找了几个对这事热心的社员先去栽起来。第二年，果然大半都活了。上边来的工作同志见了，连夸奖带教育，说在草原栽树，和风沙作斗争，是一件了不起的大事。社员们给说得动了心，就一年比一年栽的多了。直到去年，毛主席号召要绿化全国，咱们社里规划了一下，先搞起这片园子，以后还要逐年把这四外的山上都栽上树。”
          在牧场上
    我跟红星牧业社的驻社干部包玉山骑马到牧场去。一出村子不远，我们就钻进沙窝子里去了。红星社的牧场，就在这沙窝子里。牧草长得又稀又矮，只是草的质量还比较好。这里的牧场和呼伦贝尔或锡林郭勒大草原比较起来，实在差远了。那里的牧草，在夏天就像华北平原上一望无际的麦田，到处可以打草和放牧，牲畜吃也吃不完。
    就在这样的沙窝子牧场里，红星社却能够把牲畜饲养得很好。他们在建社后的三个生产年度中（从1952到1955年），全社原十五户老社员的牲畜由八百四十八头发展到一千九百四十六头，增加了一点二九倍。这样的发展速度，在全国的畜牧业中都是少有的。1956年的生产成绩同样是优异的：合作社的一百七十二只母绵羊，产羔一百八十九只（10％的母羊产了双羔），死亡十二只，纯繁殖率为109％；五百三十四只母山羊，产羔五百九十六只（12％的母羊产了双羔），死亡十二只，纯繁殖率为110％。
    红星社十分重视牲畜品种的改良工作。在建社以后的五年中，他们的绵羊有90％已经改良成半细毛羊，牛也有部分变成改良种乳牛。每头改良种牲畜所产乳、毛的价值，等于本地牲畜的好几倍。
    改良羊剪下的毛，又细又软，一团团像棉花一样，能织哔叽、毛呢。一只第二代的改良羊，每年能剪七、八斤毛，价值十六、七元。本地羊出的毛，又粗又硬，只能赶毡子，织毯子和粗呢子；一只羊一年才剪二、三斤毛，只卖二、三元钱。
    我们下了马，走进羊圈里，负责饲养幼畜的萨仁其母格正要给羊羔进行人工哺乳。她拢着一只小羊羔，用手轻轻地抚摸着那茸茸的卷毛儿。羊羔咩咩地叫着，去亲她的手，用头在她身上顶撞着。“饿啦吗？不要着急，马上就给你吃！”萨仁其母格说着，就拿起喂奶器去喂它。羊羔儿欢喜地摇着尾巴，站在那里唧咕唧咕地吃起来了。
    “这种羊羔比本地牲畜难饲养吗？”我问萨仁其母格。
    “不，只要懂得它的脾性就不难。”她说：“这种羊羔，刚生下的时候毛短，怕冻着，要在暖棚里呆几天才能让它出来；长大了爱干净，不能让它沾泥巴和生虱子……”对这种羊应该如何饮水，如何放牧，从小到大如何照顾，她讲的头头是道。
      萨仁其母格在社里是一个活跃的青年团员，平常爱说爱闹，一谈起她心爱的牲畜，话就更多了。
    萨仁其母格喂过羊羔，清扫了羊圈，又领我们到牛圈里去看改良牛。她打开圈门进去，一群牛犊欢蹦活跃地向她跑来，有花的荷兰牛，火红色的短角牛，个个毛色光亮，蹄腿干净。萨仁其母格走到它们中间，抓住一头小红牛说：“你看，它的个儿最大，可是在这一群里，它出生的最晚。”
    “这是那头第二代的短角牛吗？”包玉山问。萨仁其母格点了点头。
    包玉山走过去，仔细照量着：“真是呃，一代比一代强！”
    这头牛犊个儿高大，腰腿也特别粗壮。它的母亲是1953年出生的第一代改良牛，到第三年就给配了种。为了它的分娩，萨仁其母格和她的丈夫满特嘎，接连守候了它几个夜晚。因为这是她们的改良牛第一个产犊。当牛犊在天亮以前生下来的时候，满特嘎立即到社里去报了喜。
    “母牛的奶多吗？”
    “多呵，多呵！”萨仁其母格高兴地比划着说：“每天能挤下半小桶，加上牛犊吃的，足有七、八斤。——它这才生头胎呀，到第三胎以后，出的奶还要多哩！”从她讲话那种得意的神情，可以看出萨仁其母格因负责饲养改良牲畜的工作而感到骄傲和光荣。的确，她没有辜负全体社员对她的信任。在1956年，她饲养的一百七十二只母羊，繁殖和成活了一百七十六只羊羔，超过包产定额的20％；所产的二十多头改良牛犊，经她精心饲养，全部都成活了。现在他们已经有了五百多只改良羊和八十多头改良牛。
          种　籽
    我去拜访一个会种菜的老牧民，他不在家，去拾掇园子去了。他的儿子韩瑞林正从箱子里取着一些纸包包，一包一包地在炕上摆了一大片。原来有个邻居正在向他要菜籽。
    “唉呀，你这可是个万宝囊啦！”站在炕边的那位邻人说。
    “哪弄来这么多，都是些什么呀？”见有这么多种籽，我也不禁稀奇起来。他打开一个纸包说：“这是一种黄西红柿，去年头一次种，结的满多，又大。还有，这种黄瓜也不坏，”他打开另一个纸包，向邻居推荐着：“去年咱们种的黄瓜，你不是分到了吗？一条少不了有半斤重。”他捏出一撮黄瓜籽，给包起来。又提出一个小布袋子说：“还有西瓜籽，你要不要几颗？”
    “要是想要哩，就是怕种不好。”
    “不要紧，咱们一块研究，种上一、二年就会了。”
    “你们还种过西瓜吗？”我问。
    “哎呀，咱们这儿种的西瓜可甜啦！后边沙包包上种别的不大行，可长成了好西瓜！”
    韩瑞林原是国家机关的工作人员，因为生了病，需要长期休养，他见家乡建立了合作社，大家生活在一起，热热闹闹的，不再像过去那么荒凉和单调，也就回家长住下来。他在机关工作的时候，就喜欢养花种菜。回家的时候他就到处搜集了些种籽，准备在家种些菜蔬瓜果，来养练身体。不料这事情对村里发生了很大影响，合作社要扩大菜园子，牧民们也都要学着种菜，这就渐渐超过了他个人的兴趣，而成了群众的事业。他不知不觉的对这事也越来越起劲了。
    他向我介绍了那些种籽，又领我去看合作社的菜园。
    一方方的菜畦子，搞的又平整、又细致。社员们正在浇水，施肥。从他们工作的时候那种细心、轻巧的模样，可以看出对这种劳动已很熟练。
    菜园子不过四、五亩大，但整起来却很费力。四周得扎上坚固的篱笆，阻拦牲畜，遮挡风沙。即是这样，每年春天，还得起出一层尺把厚的飞沙，换进好土，这就要用好多工。
    最初在这里种菜的三不力扎布老汉，是此地原有的两家老住户之一。这老汉早年曾到农业区走动过，用心看过汉族农民如何种菜，并从外面带回几样菜种籽，自己就试着种起来了。那时候只在家门口，刨开炕席大的一块地，种点葱、蒜和洋芋之类，不光是为自己吃，也是为看个稀罕。但有时一场风沙，就把这小园子埋没了。
    办起合作社以后，大家就很看重三不力扎布种菜的这点本事。社里帮助他另选择了一块背风向阳的好地方，打了一眼好水井，置备了一套用具，又给分配了两个助手，就专心一意地种起菜来了。
    这小小的菜园，一年年扩大起来，菜的样数也一年年增多。附近的牧民，有的来讨菜吃，有的来参观，红星牧业社种菜的事，竟在远近百里内出了名。到夏季菜下来的时候，社员们吃也吃不完。他们还赶着大车，到远处的集市上去出卖。当那些大黄瓜、西红柿、嫩豆角和紫溜溜的大茄子，在旗人民政府所在地乌敦套海的集市上出现的时候，街上的人都围着看稀奇。当大家知道这是牧民种出的菜时，更是赞不绝口。
