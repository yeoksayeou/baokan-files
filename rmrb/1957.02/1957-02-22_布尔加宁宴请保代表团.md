Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 21st. Soviet Premier Bulganin hosted a banquet at the Grand Kremlin Palace on the evening of the 20th to welcome the Bulgarian government delegation headed by Yugov.

Soviet party and government leaders, as well as scientists and cultural workers, attended the banquet.

The banquet was filled with an atmosphere of sincerity and friendship.

Bulganin and Yugov spoke at the reception. Bulganin said that the talks between the governments and parties of our two countries have once again demonstrated that we have a completely identical view on international issues and on issues related to the relationship between our two countries.

We unanimously confirm that brotherly mutual assistance and cooperation, and the unity and consolidation of the socialist countries' camp will continue to be the foundation of the relations between our two countries. The unity of the socialist countries is the condition for ensuring that we all advance victoriously along the road of building communism, and it guarantees peace and the security of all peoples.

Yugov said in reply that the talks between the two governments and parties have always been carried out in the spirit of the great principles of Marxism-Leninism, which are the foundation of our friendship and the friendship and cooperation of all socialist countries. There is a new type of relationship between our two countries that only socialist countries can have, a relationship of complete equality, brotherly mutual understanding, and mutual assistance.

There is no doubt that the work we are carrying out and the documents to be signed are not only a new contribution to further strengthening the unity and unbreakable friendship between the peoples of the Soviet Union and the Bulgarian people, between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of Bulgaria, and between the Communist Party of Bulgaria and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, but also a contribution to strengthening the unity of the powerful socialist camp headed by the great Soviet Union.

    布尔加宁宴请保代表团
    新华社莫斯科21日电　苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁20日晚上在大克里姆林宫设宴招待以于哥夫为首的保加利亚政府代表团。
    苏联方面有党和政府的领导人以及科学家和文化工作者等出席作陪。
    宴会充满诚恳友好的气氛。
    布尔加宁和于哥夫在招待会上讲了话。布尔加宁说，我们两国的政府和党的会谈再次表明，我们对国际问题和对我们两国之间的互相关系问题的看法是完全一致的。
    我们一致确认，兄弟般的互助和合作、社会主义国家阵营的团结和巩固今后仍然是我们两国关系的基础。社会主义国家的团结一致就是保证我们大家沿着建设共产主义的道路胜利前进的条件，它能保证和平和各国人民的安全。
    于哥夫致答词说，两国政府和两党会谈始终贯彻着伟大的马克思列宁主义原则的精神，而这些原则是我们友谊的基础，是所有社会主义国家的友谊和合作的基础。我们两国之间存在着一种只有社会主义国家才有的新型关系，这是一种完全平等、兄弟般的彼此谅解和互相帮助的关系。
    毫无疑问，我们所进行的工作和即将签字的文件不仅是对进一步加强苏联各族人民和保加利亚人民之间、苏联和保加利亚人民共和国之间、保加利亚共产党和苏联共产党之间的团结和牢不可破的友谊的新贡献，而且也是对加强以伟大的苏联为首的强大的社会主义阵营的团结的贡献。（附图片）
