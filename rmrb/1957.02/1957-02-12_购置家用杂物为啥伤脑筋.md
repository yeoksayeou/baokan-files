Why is Purchasing Household Sundries Such a Headache?
By our reporter Jin Yukun

An old lady in Shenyang City ran all over the city but couldn't buy a washing bat. Actually, it's not just washing bats that are hard to buy. Even essential household items like brooms, brushes, rolling pins, and washboards have been out of stock in the market at various times. In addition, household sundries such as bamboo rice strainers, clothes pegs, straw mats for beds, iron pots, spoons, iron shovels, and kitchen knives are either unavailable or not available in all varieties. Some prices have also risen again and again. Good quality brooms for sweeping cost six or seven jiao each, and even poor quality ones cost around four jiao. This situation has really given many housewives a headache.

According to statistics from the Shenyang Handicraft Wholesale Market, the number of varieties handled by the market has decreased from 1,396 in the past to 532. Most of the shelves in stores selling these goods are empty; some only display a few samples. According to market management personnel, the current trend of reduction has not completely stopped.

Why are household sundries both scarce and expensive? To answer this question, we must talk about some of the problems in the current handicraft production in Shenyang City.

The past year was a year of rapid development for handicraft production in Shenyang. Due to the concentration of tools and funds and the rational allocation of technical forces, the total value of handicraft production in the city in 1956 reached more than 250 million yuan, an increase of 75% over the previous year. By the third quarter of last year, capital accumulation had increased nearly twofold compared with the beginning of the year. With the improvement of equipment and technology, more than 800 new varieties have been added, especially new products that individual handicraftsmen could not manufacture in the past, which were trial-produced and mass-produced for large industries. These products have played a significant role in supporting industry, capital construction, and agricultural production. In terms of product quality, there has been an improvement compared to before the cooperative transformation. Generally speaking, the achievements are great.

However, on the other hand, due to lack of experience and improper work arrangements, there are also many problems. First of all, with the increase of a large number of collaborative products serving industry, there has been a large decrease in small products necessary for residents' lives, forming an abnormal phenomenon. Shenyang is a large industrial city. During the upsurge of socialist transformation, industrial production grew rapidly, which led to a large number of collaborative tasks being assigned to handicrafts. Under such circumstances, it was natural to promote a large-scale shift of handicrafts to serve industrial production. For example, the metal products industry, which used to manufacture mostly small household items, now has more than 70% of its production capacity shifted to serving industrial construction and agricultural production. In addition, after the cooperative transformation, the production capacity of handicraftsmen has increased significantly, so they all want to further develop from producing simpler products (household goods) to manufacturing more complex products (industrial collaboration products). This is certainly an objective trend.

However, the problem does not lie entirely in objective reasons. The large reduction in the variety of household sundries is closely related to the over-concentration of handicraft production organizations. While concentrated production has many advantages, not all handicrafts need to be concentrated, especially the production of small and scattered products that serve life.

According to a survey of the three major industries of metal, wood, and sewing, production cooperatives with more than 100 people account for a large proportion, while cooperatives with less than 50 people are rare. These cooperatives are not only too large in scale, but most of them are also merged with different products that do not have much collaborative relationship with each other, resulting in a large number of people and a wide variety of products (up to hundreds of varieties), which brings many difficulties to the management of the cooperatives. Due to this situation, cooperative cadres are willing to reduce the number of varieties to facilitate management. For example, the No. 14 Wooden Products Cooperative in the Nanshi District organized all the wood-related industries in the district, such as timber, coffin making, woodenware, wood dyeing, and cork, together. It is very difficult for the leading cadres of the cooperative to take care of such a large number of products. Therefore, when they cannot manage it, they have to produce large-volume products, such as office desks and chairs, file cabinets, ping-pong tables, parallel bars and other office and sports supplies, while the original household sundries such as washboards, dining tables, pot lids, panels, cutting boards, and bellows have to be put aside and production stopped (some household sundries have now begun to resume production). The iron products industry, which used to be concentrated in the Xiaodongmen and Dabeimen areas, produced a large number of household sundries such as kitchen knives, scissors, axes, kitchen spoons, iron pots, and iron shovels, and also provided repairs. For example, if a knife was broken, it could be repaired with steel. However, after concentrated production, most of the industries in these areas were unified to process large-volume products for factories and mines. Handicraftsmen who originally manufactured hairpins, trouser hooks, shoe eyelets, and black iron buckles were also unified to produce large-volume products after being incorporated into the Small Hardware Cooperative, resulting in a reduction in the variety of products on the market and a shortage of supply. Producers who wove women's hairnets stopped weaving hairnets after being incorporated into the Silk Thread Cooperative. Similar situations are extremely common.

In addition, judging from the current market situation, handicraft products are not "goods seeking people," but "not worried about customers having goods," and most products are in a state of tight supply and demand. This situation has prompted some cooperatives to only be willing to do large-volume, high-output value, and high-profit production, and unwilling to produce small-scale, low-output value, and low-profit products; only focusing on completing production plans to increase accumulation, and rarely considering the needs of the market and residents. In this way, the small products needed by residents have become even scarcer. In the past, Huanggu District had more than 30 households specializing in the production of stoves and stove doors. After being merged into a foundry, they changed direction and mass-produced machine parts and plumbing equipment. They believe that producing stoves only yields a profit of 200 yuan per ton, while producing machine parts and plumbing equipment can double the profit, so it is better to produce general merchandise.

When handicrafts were self-produced and self-sold, they "followed the market and sold according to the season." Although it had a certain degree of blindness, it was still more flexible in adapting to market changes and caring about the needs of residents. As long as there was a shortage of something in the market, they would produce it. Even if something was missing today, the handicraftsmen would mobilize their wives and children to work day and night to produce it tomorrow and supply it to the market, and could improve production in a timely manner according to consumers' requirements for variety, specifications, and styles. Now, the vast majority of production capacity is processing orders for industrial and commercial sectors, canceling the direct link between handicrafts and the market. This has created a situation where it does not care what the market needs, and it does not consider what the market is out of stock. It only considers what the processing department wants to process. And the processing of the commercial sector can often only be the main varieties, and it is impossible to cover the ever-changing needs of the market, especially neglecting household sundries. At the same time, since the change from self-production and self-sale to processing orders has increased the commodity circulation links, the products have to add 7% to 10% commission to the wholesale store, and then add 15% wholesale and retail price difference to the retail store, which invisibly increases the product price by about 30%. When self-produced and self-sold, some handicrafts had workshops in the back and stores in the front, such as shoe-making workshops, where customers could choose to buy finished products or order them according to their foot size at any time. Since the practice of self-sales was abolished, consumers have lost this convenience.

To change the problem of the reduction in the variety of handicraft daily necessities, a series of investigations and studies and meticulous organizational work are needed. The first problem to be solved is: to clarify the direction of development. The products serving industrial construction and the products serving residents' lives should both be reasonably arranged. Shenyang is a large industrial city. It is necessary to use part of the handicraft force to serve industrial construction. Especially when large industries develop rapidly, handicrafts need more support, which causes some inconvenience to residents' lives, which is difficult to completely avoid. However, if the production of civilian products is squeezed out too much and excessive tension is caused, this needs to be adjusted and changed. According to the current situation, it is necessary to especially emphasize the importance of serving residents' lives, actively restore and increase the production of daily necessities to alleviate the current market tension. The second is the issue of concentration and decentralization. It now appears that, except for some products that are mass-processed for industrial construction, concentrated production and excessive scale are not suitable for the production of small and scattered products that generally serve life. Because this makes it difficult to maintain the original characteristics of being small and flexible, having a variety of products, and responding to changes at any time. Some production cooperatives that are improperly concentrated should comprehensively consider appropriately and gradually distributing production and improving the existing form of unified accounting separately. This can not only stimulate the enthusiasm of cooperative members to increase production and increase variety, but also better carry forward the fine traditions of handicraftsmen caring about the market, caring about quality, and adapting to the needs of residents. Of course, concentration and decentralization are not absolute and need to be handled according to specific circumstances and cannot be generalized. The third is the issue of using waste materials. Using waste materials is not only the main direction for many handicraft industries to solve the source of materials at present, but also in the future. This issue needs to be resolved. In any case, while state-owned factories are practicing economy and fully utilizing waste materials, they also need to appropriately take care of handicraft production and cannot ignore it. Moreover, it may be more economical and reasonable for handicrafts to utilize some waste materials. In expanding the source of waste materials, in addition to planned unified acquisition, it is also necessary to give full play to the enthusiasm of grassroots units in this regard. Finally, there is the issue of the price of handicraft products. This issue is very complex, as it is necessary to reduce the burden on consumers and also to encourage producers to increase variety. This is an issue that needs to be carefully studied and resolved. Of course, the work to be done on the issue of increasing variety is far more than the above-mentioned aspects. As long as we do more concrete work, we believe that we will definitely be able to make the production of household sundries for handicrafts better and more.

    购置家用杂物为啥伤脑筋
    本报记者　金雨困
    沈阳市有一位老太太，跑遍了全市却买不到洗衣用的棒槌。其实何止棒槌买不到，就连家家都少不了的扫帚、刷子、赶面杖、洗衣板等用具，市场上也都相继脱销过。此外，像盛饭用的竹淘箩、晒衣服用的夹子、铺床用的草垫及铁锅、勺子、铁铲、菜刀等家用杂物，不是无货就是品种不全。有的价格还是一涨再涨。扫地用的笤帚好的要六、七角一把，差的也要四角上下。这种情况，确使许多家庭主妇们伤透了脑筋。
    据沈阳手工业批发市场的统计，市场所经营的品种由过去的一千三百九十六种减少到五百三十二种。现在出售这些商品的商店，货架子上多半是空空的；有的仅是摆出了几件样品。据市场管理人员谈，目前这种减少的趋势还没有完全停止。
    为什么家用杂物又少又贵呢？要回答这个问题，就必须谈到当前沈阳市手工业生产的一些问题了。
    过去一年，是沈阳手工业生产飞跃发展的一年。由于工具、资金的集中和技术力量的合理调配，1956年全市手工业生产总值达二亿五千多万元，比前年增长了75％。到去年第三季度，资金积累已较年初增加了近两倍。随着设备和技术的改进，增加的新品种有八百多种，其中特别是为大工业大量试制和生产了过去为个体手工业所不能制造的新产品；这些产品对支援工业、基本建设和农业生产起了很大作用。在产品质量方面，较合作化前有所提高。总的来说成绩是大的。
    但是，另一方面，由于缺乏经验，工作安排不够妥当，存在的问题也是不少的。首先，随着为工业服务的大量协作产品的增加，却出现了为居民生活所必需的细小产品的大量减少，形成了一种不正常的现象。沈阳是一个大工业城市，在社会主义改造高潮中，由于工业生产迅速增长，因而向手工业提出了大量的协作任务，在这样的情况下，很自然地就推动了手工业大量转向为工业生产服务。如金属制品行业过去大部分制造零星生活用品，现在却有70％以上生产能力转向为工业建设和农业生产服务。此外，合作化以后，手工业者生产能力有了较大的提高，因此都想从生产较简单的产品（生活用品）进一步发展为制造较复杂的产品（工业协作产品）。这当然是一种客观的趋势。
    但是，问题不完全在于客观原因。家用杂物品种的大量减少，同目前手工业生产社组织过于集中是有很大关系的。集中生产固然有很多的好处，但并不是所有的手工业都需要集中的，特别是一些为生活服务的零星细小产品的生产更是如此。
    据金属、木制、缝纫三个主要行业调查，百人以上的生产社要占很大比重，五十人以下的社几乎很少。这些社不仅规模过大，而且大部分又是将不同产品互相之间协作关系不多的合并在一起，以致人员众多、品种繁杂（有多至数百种的），给社的管理工作带来了很多困难。由于这种情况，社干部为了便于管理，就愿意把品种减得少些。如南市区十四木制品合作社，把全区制材、制棺、木器、染木、软木等带木字的行业全组织在一起，社的领导干部要兼顾这样繁多的产品，困难很多。因此在管不过来的情况下，他们只好生产大宗产品，如办公桌椅、卷宗柜、乒乓球台、双杠等办公和体育用品，而对原有的家用杂物如洗衣板、饭桌、锅盖、面板、菜板、风箱、木床等不得不放在一边停产不管了（目前已有部分家用杂物开始恢复生产）。原来集中在小东门和大北门一带的铁制品行业，大量生产菜刀、剪子、斧子、厨勺、铁锅、铁铲等家用杂物的，既制成品又兼修理，如刀坏了还可以补钢。可是在集中生产以后，这些地区的行业，大部统一为厂矿加工大宗产品。原来制造发卡、裤勾、鞋眼扣、黑铁扣等手工业者并入小五金社后，也都被统一改为生产大宗产品，以致市场上品种减少，货源中断。编织妇女发网的生产者并入丝线社后，也停止了编织发网。类似的情况是极为普遍的。
    此外，从目前市场情况来看，手工业产品不是“货求人”，而是“有货不愁客”，大部分产品都处于供不应求的紧张状态中。这种情况就促使部分合作社只愿干大批的、产值高、赚钱多的，而不愿生产零星的、产值小、赚钱少的；只顾完成生产计划增加积累，而很少考虑市场和居民的需要。这样，居民需要的零星产品就更加减少了。皇姑区过去有三十多户专门生产炉子炉门等产品，合并为翻砂厂后就改变方向，大量生产机器零件和水暖器材。他们认为：生产炉子每吨仅获利二百元，而生产机器零件和水暖器材利润可增一倍，因此不如生产大路货。
    手工业在自产自销时，“随行就市，适季而销”，虽带有一定的盲目性，但它还是较灵活地适应市场变化和关心居民需要。只要市场上缺少什么，他们就生产什么。甚至有的今天缺的，手工业者动员老婆孩子白天黑夜赶工，明天就生产出来供应市场，并能根据消费者对品种、规格、式样的要求，及时改进生产。现在绝大部分生产能力都为工业和商业方面加工订货，取消了手工业同市场的直接联系。这样就形成了市场上需要什么，它不管，市场脱销什么，它也不考虑。它考虑的只是，加工部门要加什么，就生产什么。而商业方面的加工往往只能是主要品种，不可能包罗市场千变万化的需要，特别是不注意家用杂物。同时由于变自产自销为加工订货后，就增加了商品流转环节。产品到批发商店就得加上7％到10％的回扣，到了零售商店又得增加15％的批零差价，无形中就使产品价格增加了30％左右。自产自销时，某些手工业后边是作坊前边就是门市，如制鞋作坊，顾客既可选购成品，也可随时量脚订做。自从取消自销的做法后，消费者就失去了这种方便。
    要改变手工业日用品品种减少的问题，需要进行一系列的调查研究和细致的组织工作。首先要解决的问题是：明确发展方向。应该把为工业建设和为居民生活服务的产品，两者都加以合理的安排。沈阳是大工业城市，用手工业的部分力量为工业建设服务是必需的，特别当大工业迅速发展时，需要手工业较多的支援，给居民生活上造成了一些不便，这也是很难完全避免的。但是，如果因此过多地挤掉了民需产品的生产，造成了过分的紧张，这就需要加以调整改变。根据目前的情况，需要特别强调为居民生活服务的重要性，积极恢复和增加生活用品的生产，以缓和当前市场的紧张情况。第二是关于集中和分散的问题。现在看来，除了一些为工业建设大量加工的产品适宜集中生产外，一般为生活服务的零星细小产品的生产，过于集中和规模过大都是不太适宜的。因为这样就很难保持原来小而灵活、产品多样、随机应变的特点。某些集中不当的生产社，就应通盘考虑适当地有步骤地分点生产和分别改进现有统一核算的形式，这样既能刺激社员增加生产和增加花色品种的积极性，也能更好发扬手工业者关心市场、关心质量、适应居民需要的优良传统。当然，集中与分散不是绝对的，需根据具体情况处理而不能一概而论。第三是关于利用废料问题。利用废料，不仅是目前而且也是今后许多手工业行业解决材料来源的主要方向。这个问题需要解决。无论如何，国营工厂在厉行节约充分利用废料的同时，也还需要适当照顾手工业生产，而不能置之不顾。而且，有些废料由手工业来利用，会更经济合理些。在扩大废料来源方面，除了有计划地统一收购外，还需充分发挥基层单位在这方面的积极作用。最后是关于手工业产品价格问题。这个问题很复杂，既要减轻消费者负担，又要有利于鼓励生产者增加品种。这是一个需要很好研究解决的问题。当然，关于增加品种的问题所要做的工作，绝不止于上述的几个方面。只要多做些具体工作，我们相信一定能够把手工业家用杂物的生产搞得更多更好些。
