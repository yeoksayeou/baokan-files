Xinhua News Agency, Athens, February 7th: TASS reported from Athens on February 6th: The press office of the Soviet Embassy in Greece published a statement in the Athens newspapers on February 6th, stating: "The Soviet Union consistently adheres to the position that the Cypriot people must be granted the right to self-determination."

The Soviet Embassy issued this statement because some Greek newspapers recently published reports suggesting that the Soviet Union's position on the Cyprus issue seemed to have changed. The statement pointed out that, with the United Nations about to discuss the Cyprus issue, some Greek newspapers have launched such an anti-Soviet campaign, the purpose of which is nothing more than to attempt to worsen relations between the Soviet Union and Greece.

This statement from the Soviet Embassy has been widely welcomed in Greece. "National Herald" wrote: "People from all walks of life in Greece are deeply satisfied to see that the Soviet Union has adopted a firm and unchanging position on the issue of the Cypriot people's right to self-determination."

    揭穿破坏苏希关系的恶意宣传
    苏联重申支持塞浦路斯自决权
    新华社7日讯　据塔斯社雅典6日讯：苏联驻希腊大使馆新闻处在6日的雅典报纸上发表声明说：“苏联始终不渝地坚持必须给予塞浦路斯人民以自决权的立场”。
    苏联大使馆发表这个声明是因为最近某些希腊报纸上出现了苏联对塞浦路斯问题的立场似乎已有改变的报道。声明指出，由于联合国即将讨论塞浦路斯问题，某些希腊报纸掀起这样一个反苏运动，其目的无非是企图使苏联和希腊两国关系恶化。
    苏联大使馆的这个声明在希腊受到广泛的欢迎。“国民先驱报”写道：“希腊各界人士看到苏联对塞浦路斯人民自决权问题采取坚决不变的立场深为满意。”
