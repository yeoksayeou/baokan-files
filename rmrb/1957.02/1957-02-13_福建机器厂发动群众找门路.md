The Fujian Machine Factory has mobilized the masses to recycle waste materials, adopt substitute materials, strictly implement a quota system for material requisitioning, and strengthen raw material procurement efforts, along with mutual adjustments with brother factories. This has reversed the difficult situation of insufficient raw material supply. Preliminary plans call for increasing production by more than double this year compared to last year.

Insufficient raw material supply is a serious difficulty for the factory's production this year. In the first quarter, the state can only supply 30% of the needed high-quality steel, and the supply of tools is even more lacking. Faced with the danger of a work stoppage, factory leaders vigorously mobilized the masses to find solutions and save materials. As soon as the increase production and practice economy campaign began, all the factory workers immediately took action. Young workers first formed a youth savings team, using their spare time to recover waste and old materials. In just over a month, they collected more than 63,000 catties of scrap steel, miscellaneous iron, etc. Workers proposed the suggestion of melting cast iron powder and broken steel shavings, enabling the utilization of more than 200 tons of waste materials that had been accumulated for a long time. It is estimated that 150 tons of pig iron can be smelted, enough to cast more than 300 twelve-horsepower diesel engines.

In order to save materials, the technical department conducted detailed research, trying various methods to adopt substitute materials, and established a quota system for material requisitioning. The design department repeatedly improved the drawings, sorting out and modifying the design drawings for the twelve-horsepower diesel engine and the 55-type gas generator. It is estimated that more than 40,000 catties of high-quality steel, more than 17,000 catties of cast iron, more than 15,000 catties of steel plates, and more than 4,000 catties of copper can be saved annually after improving six designs.

The shortage of tools is also a major difficulty in production. Supply and marketing personnel could not purchase high-grade alloy blades everywhere. Chen Shuiguan, the tool warehouse administrator, suggested using a kind of black smoke wire drawing die that could be purchased to replace the manufacture of alloy knives. After successful trials by technicians and workers, the cutting effect was very good. In addition, the young savings team members also re-used the short alloy drill bits that had been discarded in the past by attaching a rod to them.

The supply and marketing department went everywhere to find solutions, purchasing raw materials and establishing preliminary contacts with various iron milling factories in the province, purchasing some cast iron from the iron milling factories.

    福建机器厂发动群众找门路
    据福建日报讯　福建机器厂发动群众，回收废料，采用代用料，厉行限额领料制度，并加强原料收购工作同兄弟厂互相调剂，扭转了原材料供应不足的困难情况，初步计划今年比去年增产一倍以上。
    原材料供应不足是这个厂今年生产的严重困难，第一季度内国家只能供给所需优质钢的30％，工具等供应更加缺少。面对着停工的危险，工厂领导大力发动群众找窍门，节约用料。增产节约运动一开始，全厂职工马上行动起来，青年职工首先组成了青年节约队，利用工余时间回收废料、旧料，一个多月中即拾到废钢、杂铁等六万三千多斤。工人提出了熔化铸铁粉、碎钢屑的建议，使长期积存的两百多吨废料得以利用，预计可熔炼出生铁一百五十多吨，足够浇铸十二匹马力柴油机三百多台。
    为了节约用料，技术部门作了细致的研究，多方想法采用代用料，并建立了限额领料制度。设计科反复改进图纸，把十二匹马力的柴油机、55型煤气机的设计图纸作了整理、修改。在改进六项设计后预计全年可节约优质钢四万多斤，铸铁一万七千多斤，钢板一万五千多斤，铜四千多斤。
    工具缺乏也是生产上的大困难，供销科人员到处采购不到高级合金刀片，工具库管理员陈水官建议用能够买到的一种乌烟拉丝模来代替制造合金刀，经过技术员和工人试制成功，切削效用很好。此外，青年节约队员们还把过去丢弃不用的短的合金钻头，在上边接了个杆重新加以利用。
    供销科四出找门路，采购原料并同省内各铣铁厂初步建立了联系，向铣铁厂采购了部分铸铁。
