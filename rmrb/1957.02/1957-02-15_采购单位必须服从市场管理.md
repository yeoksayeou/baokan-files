    Purchasing Units Must Obey Market Management
    By our commentator
    At the recent national rural free market conference held by the Fifth Office of the State Council, representatives from many regions reflected that some state-owned commercial departments, supply and marketing cooperatives, joint state-private stores, as well as consumer units such as government agencies, military units, schools, and enterprises, are sending people to production areas to illegally purchase materials under state unified purchase and to drive up prices to抢购(qiǎnggòu) (panic buy/rush buy) materials in the open free market. Because there are too many concentrated purchasing units and the local market lacks organization and leadership, chaotic conditions have formed in some commodity markets.
    Taking the Henan Huai medicine market as an example, at the end of November last year, about dozens of units from various places (including local pharmaceutical companies, joint state-private pharmacies, supply and marketing cooperatives, pharmaceutical factories, and medical departments) went to the production areas to purchase dried rehmannia root. A purchasing agent from a joint state-private pharmacy in Xiangtan City, Hunan Province, hired more than a dozen farmers and small vendors to go from village to village to purchase the material, stipulating that anyone who purchased 50 jin would be given a handling fee of 10 yuan, plus food and travel expenses during their trips. As a result, they purchased more than 20,000 jin of dried rehmannia root. For another example, in the fourth quarter of last year, more than 1,000 purchasers gathered in the Zhejiang Province's bamboo production areas,抢购(qiǎnggòu) (panic buying) more than 760,000 bamboo poles by driving up prices.
    There are also many instances of consumer units directly sending purchasing personnel to distant locations or to the local market to 抢购(qiǎnggòu) (panic buy) non-staple foods and local specialties. For example, the Shanghai Native Produce and Waste Product Management Office of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives sent four cadres to Funing County, Jiangsu Province, and through local merchants, 抢购(qiǎnggòu) (panic buy) more than 30,000 *qian* (each *qian* containing six sheets) of reed mats at high prices. The Xuzhou Prefectural Office of the Jiangsu Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative sent people to Sheyang County to 抢购(qiǎnggòu) (panic buy) reed stalks at prices higher than the local list price (0.5 yuan higher per *dan*). The canteens affiliated with the Xi'an Catering Company alone sent people to various places to purchase more than 8,000 jin of pork in November of last year.
    The harm of 抢购(qiǎnggòu) (panic buying) is obvious. First of all, it causes chaos in market prices, and the price differences are huge. For example, the price of Henan dried rehmannia root exceeds the state list price by 100% to 700%. Purchasing units generally do not bargain, as long as there are goods to buy; many materials that were not originally in short supply in the market have also caused farmers to be reluctant to sell because of 抢购(qiǎnggòu) (panic buying), and even prompted some farmers to be unwilling to sell locally and instead engage in long-distance trafficking; what is more serious is that unreasonable high-price incentives have damaged the production of certain products. For example, due to the high-price 抢购(qiǎnggòu) (panic buying) of bamboo in Honghu County, Hubei Province, farmers massively felled bamboo regardless of the season, creating difficulties for future production.
    Many materials designated by the state for unified purchase and unified distribution (such as live pigs, bamboo, raw lacquer, etc.) have been purchased in large quantities through 抢购(qiǎnggòu) (panic buying), causing difficulties for the departments entrusted by the state to make purchases, because these purchasing departments cannot arbitrarily raise prices, and therefore cannot purchase goods. For products that originally had pre-purchase contracts with farmers or agricultural cooperatives, farmers and agricultural cooperatives are unwilling to deliver them because market prices are too high, making it impossible for the state to have enough sources of supply for certain commodities, which affects the state's normal supply to the market and the needs for export.
    In the early stages of opening up the free market, some confusion was understandable because the boundaries of open commodities were not clearly defined; however, since the State Council issued the "Instructions on Relaxing the Management of Rural Markets" in late October last year, clarifying the scope of open varieties and explaining the policies, purchasing units are still raising prices to 抢购(qiǎnggòu) (panic buy) regardless of variety. This is a violation of state policy. At present, market management in most regions has not kept up, and even some grassroots market management departments dare not interfere with purchasing units from above, so the phenomenon of mutual price increases and 抢购(qiǎnggòu) (panic buying) is still very serious.
    The main purpose of the state's opening of the free market is to invigorate the urban and rural economy, stimulate the production of agricultural and sideline industries, and supplement the deficiencies in the state market. However, the price increases and 抢购(qiǎnggòu) (panic buying) behavior of some purchasing departments and collective consumer units have disrupted the market for certain commodities and are also detrimental to the development of production. This phenomenon should be given great attention and effectively curbed in all regions.
    We believe that people's committees at all levels and local market management departments must manage these purchasing units in accordance with the spirit of the State Council's instructions. It is necessary to prohibit state-owned commercial enterprises, supply and marketing cooperatives, joint state-private stores, cooperative stores (groups), government agencies, organizations, schools, military units, factories, mines, and other units from illegally purchasing materials under state unified purchase and unified acquisition, and they must not raise prices to 抢购(qiǎnggòu) (panic buy) agricultural and sideline products in the open free market. When the above-mentioned units send purchasing personnel to rural areas to purchase materials in the free market, they should generally do so through *xingzhan* (行栈, traditional commercial brokerages) or exchanges. They must consciously implement the state's various policies and obey the management of the local market.

    采购单位必须服从市场管理
    本报评论员
    国务院第五办公室最近召开的全国农村自由市场会议上，许多地区代表反映目前有些国营商业部门、供销社、公私合营商店以及机关、部队、学校、企业等消费单位派人到产地非法收购国家统一收购的物资和抬价抢购开放自由市场的物资，由于采购单位集中过多，当地市场又缺乏组织和领导，所以形成了某些商品市场的混乱现象。
    以河南怀药市场为例，去年11月底，约有来自各地的几十个单位（有各地药材公司，公私合营药铺、供销社、制药厂、医疗部门）到产地采购生地。湖南湘潭市一家公私合营药铺的采购员，在当地雇用了十多名农民和小商贩串乡收购，规定凡收购五十斤者给手续费十元，另外还付给下乡期间的饭费和路费，结果收购了生地二万多斤。又如，浙江省毛竹产区在去年第四季度集中了一千多名采购人员，抬价抢购了毛竹七十六万多根。
    消费单位直接派采购人员远途或在当地市场上抢购副食品、小土特产品的现象也很多。例如，全国供销合作总社上海土产废品经营处，派了四个干部到江苏省阜宁县，通过当地商贩，以高价抢购了三万多箝（每箝六张）芦席；江苏省供销社徐州专区办事处派人到射阳县以高于当地牌价（每担高出五角）抢购芦柴。西安市饮食公司所属的一些食堂，仅在去年11月份，派人到各地收购的猪肉就有八千多斤。
    抢购的危害十分明显，首先是造成市场价格的混乱，而且差距悬殊很大，像河南生地价格都超过国家牌价一倍到七倍多，收购单位一般是不讲价钱，只要有货可买就行；许多原来市场并不紧张的物资，也因为争购而造成农民惜售，甚至促成某些农民不愿在当地出售，而进行远途贩运；更为严重的是由于不合理的高价刺激，破坏了某些产品的生产，像湖北洪湖县的毛竹，由于高价抢购，使得农民不顾季节地大量砍伐，造成今后生产的困难。
    许多国家指定经营机构负责统一收购和统一分配的物资（如生猪、毛竹、生漆等）被大量抢购，给国家委托收购的部门造成了困难，因为这些收购部门不能够任意抬价，因此就收购不到货物；原来和农民或农业社订有预购合同的产品，也因为市场价格过高，农民和农业社不愿交售，使国家对某些商品无法掌握足够的货源，影响了国家对市场的正常供应和出口的需要。
    自由市场开放的初期，由于对开放商品的界限没有划分清楚，因此在某些地方造成一些混乱现象是可以理解的；但是自从去年十月下旬，国务院发布“关于放宽农村市场管理问题的指示”，把开放的品种范围划分清楚，并交代了政策以后，采购单位仍然不分品种地抬价抢购，这就是违犯国家政策的行为了。目前，大部分地区的市场管理工作还没有跟上去，甚至有些基层市场管理部门还不敢过问来自上面的采购单位，因此相互抬价抢购的现象仍然十分严重。
    国家开放自由市场的主要目的在于活跃城乡经济，刺激农副业的生产和弥补国家市场的不足，但是某些采购部门和集体消费单位的抬价抢购行为，却搞乱了某些商品的市场，而且对生产的发展也是不利的。这种现象各地应该引起很大的重视，并加以有效的制止。
    我们认为，各级人民委员会和各地市场管理部门要把这些采购单位按照国务院指示的精神管起来，必须禁止各地国营商业、供销合作社、公私合营商店、合作商店（组）、机关、团体、学校、部队、厂矿企业等单位非法地采购国家统购和统一收购的物资，并不得抬价抢购开放自由市场的农副产品。上述各单位派往农村的采购人员在采购自由市场上的物资的时候，一般地都应该通过行栈或交易所进行，他们必须自觉地执行国家的各项政策，服从当地市场的管理。
