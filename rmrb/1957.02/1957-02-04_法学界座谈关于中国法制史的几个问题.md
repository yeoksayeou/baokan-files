Symposium in Legal Circles on Several Issues Concerning the History of Chinese Legal System

The study of the history of the Chinese legal system (or the history of state and law) has recently attracted the attention of legal circles. In late November 1956, the China Political Science and Law Association invited legal scholars in Beijing to hold a symposium on the history of the Chinese legal system. Attendees exchanged views on the significance and methods of studying the history of the legal system, the objects and names of legal history research, and the research steps.

Regarding the significance and methods of studying the history of the Chinese legal system, everyone agreed that studying the history of the development of the Chinese legal system in various dynasties using Marxist-Leninist scientific methods is of great significance for us to highly consciously and correctly evaluate and inherit historical heritage, and for the construction of our people's democratic legal system. The historical materials related to the history of the legal system in China can be described as vast and very rich. However, past legal history researchers, under the conditions at the time, could not and could not correctly create this major. Only now, with Marxist-Leninist thought as our guide and using the methods of dialectical materialism and historical materialism for research, is it possible to achieve success.

During the symposium, Yang Yuqing and others believed that we should not treat our legal heritage as a "national treasure" and put it on our heads, but rather regard it as "data," eliminate the false and retain the true, discard the crude and select the refined, criticize what should be criticized, and affirm what should be affirmed. Under criticism, we can also absorb its rational content, and in affirmation, we must also abandon its erroneous things. Zhang Zhirang, Wu Enyu, and others suggested that because China's legal materials are very rich, we must emphasize division of labor and cooperation in research work. In the work of collecting and processing materials, different types of people with different conditions should be assigned to discuss and study together.

Attendees unanimously believed that the research object of legal history should be the state system and the legal system. Everyone criticized the method of bourgeois legal scholars of separating the state and the law and conducting research in isolation. However, Chen Shengqing and others proposed that the scope of legal history should not be too narrow. In addition to studying the state system and the legal system, it can also involve the political and legal viewpoints from which these systems are generated. Zhang Xipo and others believe that the difference between the history of Chinese political thought and the history of the Chinese legal system should first be distinguished; the former studies not only the various political theories of the ruling class, but also the various political theories of the ruled class, while the latter only studies the state system and the legal system that serve the ruling class.

Regarding the name "Legal History," attendees held two different opinions. Li Zuyin, Lu Weiqian, Zhang Yingnan, Chen Shengqing, Luo Yaopei, and others believed that the name "Legal History" has been used throughout the dynasties, is concise and comprehensive, and includes both the state and the law, so they agreed to continue using the name "Legal History"; Xiao Yongqing, Zhang Guohua, Zhang Xipo, Wu Enyu, and others believed that the name "History of State and Law" more accurately reflects the research object of this science, and it has long been adopted by most schools and become a current new habit, so they advocated adopting the name "History of State and Law."

Finally, everyone was very concerned about the specific practices of conducting research, believing that the materials of our country's legal history are very rich and scattered in various books, such as the fifteen official chronicles of the Twenty-Six Histories (which are materials on state organization), fourteen criminal law chronicles, food and goods chronicles, etc.; and the writing is ancient and difficult to understand, therefore, efforts should be organized to annotate these ancient books. In the work, we should also strengthen the cooperation between older and younger comrades, and give due importance and respect to those who are proficient in old law, history, and literature, so that they can also exert their strength.

    法学界座谈关于中国法制史的几个问题
    关于中国法制史（或称国家与法的历史）的研究，近来引起了法学界的注意。中国政治法律学会在1956年11月下旬，曾邀请在京的法学界人士举行了一次关于中国法制史的座谈会。到会者围绕着研究法制史的意义、方法，法制史的研究对象、名称和研究步骤等问题交换了意见。
    关于研究中国法制史的意义和方法问题，大家一致认为：以马克思列宁主义的科学方法来研究中国历代法制发展的历史，对于我们高度自觉地、正确地评价和承继历史遗产，对于我们人民民主法制的建设，都具有非常重要的意义。中国历史上有关法制史的资料，可以说是浩如烟海，非常丰富。但过去的法制史研究工作者，在当时的条件下，没有也不可能正确地创造这门专业。只有在现在，我们有了马克思列宁主义的思想做指导，以辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义的方法进行研究，才有可能获得成就。
    在座谈中，杨玉清等认为，对于我国的法学遗产，不要把它当“国宝”看待，顶在头上，而应把它看作“资料”，去伪存真，去粗取精，该批判的批判，该肯定的肯定，在批判之下，也可以吸取其合理的内容，在肯定之中，也必须抛弃其错误的东西。张志让、吴恩裕等提出，由于我国有关法制的材料十分丰富，所以在研究工作中必须强调分工和合作。在搜集材料和处理材料的工作中，应分配不同类型和具有不同条件的人，共同商讨和研究。
    到会者一致认为，法制史的研究对象应该是国家制度和法律制度。大家批判了资产阶级法学者将国家和法律割裂开来孤立地进行研究的方法。但陈盛清等提出，法制史的范围不要太狭窄了，它除了研究国家制度和法律制度以外，也可涉及到这些制度所由产生的政治观点和法律观点。张希坡等人则认为，首先应当区别中国政治思想史和中国法制史的不同对象；前者所研究的既包括统治阶级的各种政治学说，也包括被统治阶级的各种政治学说，后者仅研究为统治阶级服务的国家制度和法律制度。
    关于“法制史”的名称问题，到会者持有两种不同的意见。李祖荫、卢蔚乾、张映南、陈盛清、罗耀培等认为“法制史”这一名称为历代所沿用，言简意赅，把国家和法律都包括在内，所以同意沿用“法制史”的名称；萧永清、张国华、张希坡、吴恩裕等则认为，“国家与法的历史”这一名称更能确切地反映这门科学所研究的对象，而且也早已为多数学校所采用，成为现行的新习惯，所以主张采用“国家与法的历史”的名称。
    最后，大家对进行研究的具体做法问题很关心，认为我国法制史的材料十分丰富，散见于各种书籍中，如二十六史的十五个职官志（是国家组织方面的资料），十四个刑法志，食货志等等；且文词古奥，不易了解，因此，应组织力量对这些古书做些注释工作。在工作中还应加强老年与青年同志间的合作，对旧法学、史学、文学有素养的人，应予以应有的重视和尊敬，使他们也能发挥出自己的力量。	（王昭仪）
