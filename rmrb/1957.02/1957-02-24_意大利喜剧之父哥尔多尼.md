　　Who has been to Venice and not loved this city on the water? A street is a river. You have to take a boat to go out. If you don't take a boat, you have to walk along the narrow sidewalks, over all kinds of large and small bridges. During the day, you can see art, dazzling and beautiful, with colorful oil paintings and quaint mosaics. At night, take a small boat—who can forget the world-famous gondola and the gondolier standing at the stern rowing the boat? He sings songs, paddling through winding small and large rivers, rocking a couple on board into the water and sky of the Lagoon (inner sea). Daily joy, even more joy during the New Year and holidays.

　　On February 25, 1707, Carlo Goldoni, the father of modern Italian comedy, was born in this "city of entertainment."

　　Venice at that time was a wealthy aristocratic republic. From the end of the eleventh century, the ruling class used the Crusades to develop its trade with the East, with commercial ties extending as far as China. Marco Polo, who served as an official in China during the early Yuan Dynasty, was a Venetian. Wealth cultivates enjoyment. Venice's unique location is its guarantee of security. However, the discovery of the Americas and sea routes to India promoted the prosperity of countries on the eastern coast of the Atlantic. The rise of the Turks also cut off Venice's transportation to the East. Venice in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, like other aristocratic republics and tyrant states in Italy, was already heading towards poverty. Although Venice lost the prestige of the Renaissance, the word "happy" has long been the basic emotional tone of Venetian life. During festivals, everyone wears masks, regardless of wealth or poverty, and enters and exits the grand ballrooms. Goldoni was born in this era of change, though not obvious, the trend was already in decline. In his touching "autobiography," he tells us that his father (a doctor) initially arranged for him to study philosophy in distant Rimini. The boring scholastic philosophy discouraged him from continuing his studies. He followed a traveling theater troupe and returned to his hometown. His father forgave his truant son and wanted him to study medicine, apprenticing at his side. His mother understood her son's feelings and persuaded his father to let him study law. Goldoni never gave up his title as a lawyer. However, his court appearances were also limited. He was confident and happy to engage not in defense, but in writing plays. He hoped to make comedy replace "professional comedy."

　　What is Italian "professional comedy" or "commedia dell'arte"?

　　This is a theatrical genre that emerged during the Renaissance. Italy at that time did not have professional playwrights. Literati wrote plays entirely on a whim. Among the most successful comedies, the first to be recommended is the historian and politician Machiavelli's satire of the clergy, the comedy of manners, "The Mandrake" (1513). "Literary comedy" did not seem to work for traveling troupes, they inherited more of the popular folk, ancient local operas. They lacked playwrights, the actors centered on themselves, searched for stories, and performed the "professional comedy" that later prevailed in Italy. The reason it is called "professional comedy" is because the performance of comedy (which is often "farce") is entirely done by professional actors themselves. They do not have complete dialogue scripts, and if there is dialogue, it is not complete, there are only scenarios, or simply story outlines. Skilled collaboration is an important factor for the success of the performance. But the decisive factor is the genius of imitation and superb acting skills. The audience especially welcomed these street performers' "ad-libbing" language and actions. The dialogue was improvised on stage by them according to the requirements of the story. As more and more improvisations accumulated, the actors could not create new ones, and they would randomly use them in certain environments and under certain identities. The characters they played were always stereotypical. These characters came from life, and after the artists' ingenious shaping and successful stage performances, they became images that an actor played for life. They also preserved the things left by tradition in the character design. Wearing masks is an important feature to illustrate stereotypes.

　　Not all characters wear masks. Male and female lovers do not wear them; women sometimes cover the center of their faces with a small piece of black velvet (loup), but this is decoration, not a mask, because women generally wear them normally. Maids do not wear masks. Only ugly characters wear masks. There are two bourgeois ugly characters: one is the comic image of Venetian merchants created by street performers; the other is the comic image of a Doctor of Law (later also a Doctor of Medicine) with a mouth full of Latin, his birthplace being Bologna, Italy's earliest university. The former is called Pantalone, a stingy and lustful old man, sometimes playing the role of a parent. His mask is dark brown, with a hooked nose, a long gray beard, and occasionally a pair of round glasses. He wears slippers and a large black cloak, revealing his red clothes, red pants, and red socks. The latter's mask is skin-colored (also black), with red cheeks and a pair of upturned mustaches under the nose, showing an extraordinary appearance.

　　They must have lackeys, and they must be made fun of by the lackeys. The artists picked two poor wretches from Bergamo, a mountain city in the north, to match. One is the clever and cunning Brighella, wearing an olive-colored mask and dressed in a uniform-like attire worn by male servants. This mischievous rogue lackey later became Neapolitan under other names. The other lackey, as a counterpart, is a fool. This is Arlecchino, who often appears on the European stage. Goldoni tells us that his colorful clothes indicate his origin, because they are pieced together from rags he picked up [1]. His hat is adorned with a rabbit's tail, which Bergamo farmers have always used to decorate their hats. He has a wooden sword stuck in his waist. Truffaldino in "The Servant of Two Masters" is another name for Arlecchino, and the two masters beat him with his own wooden sword. He wears a black mask. He is a very important character, requiring the skills of a Chinese martial arts clown. He is stupid, but he has his own wisdom. His innocence makes him lovable. Hunger and gluttony are his (a poor man's) true colors.

　　These four stereotypical characters, speaking with a mixture of local dialects, form the hallmark of Italian "professional comedy." Each actor, playing such a stereotypical character, adds his own colors to the basic image and takes another name. Truffaldino is the name that the famous actor Sacchi gave to the stereotypical character Arlecchino that he played. In any play, he calls himself Truffaldino (meaning "deceitful").

　　These "professional comedy" actors often lead a traveling life. They sometimes have to help quack doctors sell fake medicine at markets. Goldoni met such artists in Milan, helping quack doctors (who were scholars with several doctorates!) sell fake medicine during the day and performing farces by candlelight at night. They had a significant influence on his playwriting. These artists, wandering around the world, traveling north and south, performed their unique skills in various countries. They had a fixed theater in Paris. Molière's troupe, after returning to Paris, initially and finally used the theater in rotation with the Italian "professional comedy" troupe. Their lively acting skills and the flowing atmosphere of the drama left an undeniable mark on Molière's performing arts and playwriting. His ugly characters sometimes do not change their names, borrowing from "professional comedy." Although Shakespeare was born earlier, he was not necessarily completely unfamiliar with this theatrical genre that caused a sensation in Europe. At least he explicitly expressed his opposition to impromptu wording. In Act III, Scene II of Hamlet, Hamlet says to Player One: "And let those that play your clowns speak no more than is set down for them; for there be of them that will themselves laugh, to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh too, though in the meantime some necessary question of the play be then to be considered." [II]

　　What Goldoni wanted to reform in Italy in the eighteenth century was exactly the direction that Shakespeare and Molière had worked towards in their own countries, and it was also the direction he himself attempted to achieve. However, in terms of reform, he was far more difficult than these two foreign predecessors. They "as 'twere, the mirror up to nature" [III], they just had to hold up the mirror, but when he held up the mirror, he also had to beware of someone not wanting him to hold up the mirror. Because Shakespeare and Molière could ignore the existence of "professional comedy" in other countries, but for Goldoni, "professional comedy" not only existed, but had also evolved into a national entertainment in his country, with a long historical tradition and a deep social foundation. If you bump into it and it doesn't fall, you yourself will fall.

　　However, after "professional comedy" entered the eighteenth century, performances fell into a pattern of repetition, impromptu lines lacked life content and were divorced from reality. For example, a lover, feeling jealous, would always repeat these witty remarks in any play: "I am jealous because I am in love. Oh! What a strange contradiction. Love is like fire, jealousy is like ice, when they meet, I am doomed. They attack me from both sides, I have passion, but I am also powerless. Now I am shivering on the outside and running a high fever on the inside." [IV] No matter how good the lines are, they become tiresome after hearing them for a long time. Actors lack creativity, but they also grab gimmicks and create erotic scenes.

　　Goldoni did not appreciate "professional comedy." In his "autobiography," he specifically mentioned the masks worn by ugly actors: "Masks must often hinder the actors' expressions of sadness and joy; whether in love, angry, or excited, the expressions on their faces are always the same; he makes gestures and changes his voice, but he cannot convey emotions with his face; the face is an explanation of the inner heart, an explanation of the various emotions that excite his inner heart." He believed that ancient Greece and Rome had the need to use masks to help amplify sound, "but today, artists must have a soul; and the soul is pressed under the mask, just like fire buried under ashes." [V]

　　At that time, there were not too many people who held his views on "professional comedy," but too few. He was not a capitalist and could not rent a theater and start a troupe to realize his reform ideals. He had to cooperate with a troupe and maintain his family by writing plays. He originally had no relationship with the troupe, unlike Shakespeare and Molière, who had always stayed in the troupe. He had to deal with the actors while guiding them to change the traditional performance style. Fortunately, he had a strong capital, that is: when writing plays, he was responsive to every request, and he responded quickly. He had talent and endurance.

　　He wrote scenarios for famous ugly actors. The initial form of "The Servant of Two Masters" was just a detailed outline. In 1743, Goldoni was practicing law in Pisa when he received a letter from Sacchi in Venice, which provided the story of "The Servant of Two Masters" and hoped that Goldoni would help him write it, with him starring as Truffaldino. Sacchi then asked him for a "professional comedy": "Arlecchino's Child Found Again." This farce was also successful, and troupes everywhere rushed to perform it. He later went to Paris, which was led by it, but he felt that it had many shortcomings and did not include it in his collection of dramas. He included the complete dialogue of "The Servant of Two Masters." This in 1753, there is no doubt that Sacchi's impromptu creation, he also used it. In terms of characters, this is a typical "professional comedy," with all four mask characters (although Brighella became a shopkeeper with a considerable status), two pairs of lovers, and a witty maid—Goldoni most appreciated this type of "hua dan" actress. Nine actors, or perhaps adding a boastful and timid captain (a stereotypical character mocking Spanish officers—Spanish troops had long been stationed in Italy), is the ideal organization for an Italian "professional comedy" troupe.

　　Success made his cooperation with the troupe closer and closer. From 1749, he signed a contract with a troupe performing in Venice to supply eight new scripts each year, not including adaptations and seasonal poems. He became a professional playwright. The troupe accepted his reform plan, encouraging actors not to wear masks and to perform complete literary scripts with dialogue. In addition to writing plays, he also had to direct the actors, because stepping into life and not wearing masks was not something every actor could do well. He wrote plays at an astonishing speed. One year he wrote sixteen scripts in one breath, several of which were masterpieces.

　　Approaching the actors was a major condition for his success. He discovered play materials from the actors, absorbed their personalities to become the characters' personalities, and tried to minimize the difficulty for them to shape the characters. Approaching the audience was another major condition for his success. Like Molière, he valued the word-of-mouth of the audience in the stalls. In Venice, as in other cities in Italy, boxes became clubs or drawing rooms for wealthy families. Guests surrounded a card table, chatting about everything. Unless they were happy, they would quietly watch the play. They were infinitely gracious if they did not spit down into the stalls. The audience in the stalls was another matter. They really understood the play, shouting "bravo" when they saw something exciting, and booing when they were not satisfied. The stalls were dark, with few candles lit there. The first audience members to arrive groped for the hard benches, sat down, and waited for someone to collect the money (an average of one dime), while the later arrivals had to stand. Goldoni respected them. He left his best works to be performed in Venice. He wrote his best comedies for them, especially the masterpieces of Venetian scenery written in the Venetian language. He had a special fondness for the poor audience. His opponents scolded him for flattering the lowlifes. When talking about his masterpiece "The Respectable Girl," he once recorded in his "autobiography":

　　"In some scenes of this comedy, I portrayed the gondoliers of Venice in their natural state, which people familiar with the language and customs of my hometown found very interesting.

　　"This class of lackeys, which should be paid attention to, was not satisfied with me, and I hoped to reconcile with them.

　　"When the stalls are dissatisfied, the gondoliers of Venice can go to the theater to watch the play, but they cannot see my comedy, so they have to wait for their masters to leave after the play on the streets or boats. They said some funny and strange things about me, and I heard them. So I arranged a place for them to watch the play in the corner of the theater, and they watched themselves on stage and were very happy. I became friends with them." [VI]

　　He is a master of plain description. He effortlessly moved life onto the stage naturally, and then naturally ended the play from its development. In this respect, Molière, whom he regarded as a teacher, was not as good as him. He valued personality and called some of his comedies comedies of character, but in this respect, he obviously did not reach the highest level of achievement of Molière. Like Molière, he always pursued the moral significance of events, although he lacked the spirit of criticism or fighting spirit of his predecessor. He wrote "The Respectable Girl" (1749) because he saw a licentious farce that ruined a girl "without talent and without morality." In his opinion, in his own words: "Comedy is, or should be, a school for teaching people to learn well, exposing human weaknesses only to correct these weaknesses." [VII] But he is not a moralist, deliberately putting morality first. He educates the audience through life itself. The feeling of awe is incompatible with his comedy. He wants his fellow countrymen to laugh heartily, and the audience affectionately calls him "Papa Goldoni." On September 24, 1760, Voltaire, the "uncrowned king" of Europe, wrote to him from France:

　　"My dear sir, painter of nature and son, I have loved you since I read your works. I see your soul in your works. I say: This is an honest and kind person who has purified the Italian stage, created with imagination, and written with discernment. Oh! How abundant, my dear sir! How pure! In my opinion, the style is extremely natural, humorous and charming. You have saved your country from the maze of nonsense." [VIII]

　　The comedy "The Mistress of the Inn" (1753) just illustrates the comments "natural, humorous and charming." We had a revised translation of this popular masterpiece of European comedy in 1927. [IX] This is not Venetian scenery. Florence is the setting of the story. Class relations are clearly contrasted in the play through the characters. Three aristocratic men of different classes, a slave-status clerk, but the shop owner's daughter, who belongs to the bourgeoisie, does not choose the former, but chooses the latter as her husband. We have no intention of emphasizing these class contrasts, but thanks to Goldoni's exquisite brushstrokes, the contrasts are naturally and interestingly brought to life in front of us through the language of the characters. Three nobles, one with a higher status than the other, Marquis, Earl, and Knight, live in an inn. The owner has passed away, leaving a daughter, who said in her will that she should marry a capable clerk in the store. The young and beautiful Mirandolina, played by a "hua dan" actress at the time, shows that her personality contains intelligence, liveliness, and flirtatiousness. She does not want to wear a wedding ring immediately, but while she enjoys herself, she is also quite reserved, or rather, quite proud and humble. She finds that the new Knight is a person who is rude to women. She wants him to know how powerful women are. The result of the punishment is that this wild man loves her like a mad dog. She refuses the protection of the other two nobles and decides to marry the clerk who is waiting for her to marry: the husband is the legal protector. Some French and German translations, changing it to her marrying the Knight, completely distort her personality and Goldoni's admirable understanding of such a sincere personality. The most comical character in the play is the fallen Marquis, who, while claiming to protect her, steals the bottle of gold wine that the Knight gave her. Voltaire wrote to Goldoni, joking: "I have always intended to ask the Marquis to protect me." [X]

　　Goldoni wrote more than one hundred and fifty plays. Most of them were written before he left his home country. His comedy skills had reached a superb level. In his "autobiography," he tells us that he can write plays in a very short period of time, relying on his enthusiasm and his skilled techniques: "Through time, experience and habit, I am very familiar with comedy techniques. The story is constructed, the characters are selected, and everything else is routine for me. To write a play, I must complete four tasks before revising and finishing. The first task: planning, distinguishing, three main parts, opening, conflict, ending. The second task: dividing into acts and scenes. The third task: the dialogue of the main scenes. The fourth task: the general dialogue of the entire play.

　　"It often happens that in the last task, I change what I have written in the second and third tasks; because ideas come one after another, the previous scene produces the next scene; an occasional expression provides a new idea. After a while, I can reduce the four tasks into one task; I have a plan in my heart, and there are also three distinctions, and I immediately start writing the first scene of the first act, all the way to the end, always thinking of this motto: The entire clue should end at a definite point, that is, it should end in the ascent of action: it is the main purpose of starting the entire machine." [XI]

　　But his excess writing did not receive a single extra subsidy from the troupe's funders. Even if he printed his own scripts in Venice, he had no right to intervene in any rights without the permission of the funders. "Papa Goldoni," loved by the people of Venice, had to lower his voice in Venice in his last years and often write such letters of lack to the funders: "Now, to be honest, the money issue has become my top priority. My brother is with me. I must repay the debts he left in Modena; I must make clothes for him and find him a job. I have no money, today I borrowed six sequins from someone (about seventy francs)." [XII]

　　Life was difficult, and his reform of "professional comedy" brought him all kinds of unpleasant blows. He is a bourgeois intellectual, and when praising bourgeois morality, he gave sympathy to the "lower classes," and truthfully wrote about the evil deeds and depravity of the nobles. He loves his hometown, but his spirit yearns for the unification of Italy. He does not interfere in politics, but in fact his progressive ideas make him a worker for a national cause, not limited to local artistic activities. The people welcomed his broad smile, his deep smile. However, some nobles, obsessed with the past, were very dissatisfied with him. The Council of Ten of the Republic of Venice did not agree to give him a subsidy. He often read critical texts. Before Goldoni left Venice, Voltaire wrote a letter to their mutual friend, expressing his indignation in poetry:

　　"They don't know what reason to use
　　To judge his works, please nature
　　To be the arbitrator of the lawsuit.
　　Nature honestly and without courtesy
　　Said to the critics and opponents:
　　'Every writer has shortcomings,
　　But Goldoni paints me'." [XIII]

　　Goldoni decided to accept the invitation of the Paris "professional comedy" troupe and went to France. He wrote an allegorical comedy "The Last Night of Carnival" to bid farewell to his dear Venetian audience. Before leaving, he went to see this comedy performed and heard the audience in the stalls shouting "Bon voyage!" "Goodbye!" "Be sure to come back!" In his "autobiography," he humbly said: "I admit that I was very moved and even shed tears." [XIV]

　　He settled in Paris (1762) and lived there until his death (what a great loss for Venice and comedy!). He taught Italian at the court of Louis XV. He lost sight in one eye. He wrote a masterpiece of comedy in French, "The Beneficent Bear" (1771), and the performance at the Comédie-Française was a sensation. The King gave him a subsidy (the cost of teaching Italian) to maintain his life in Paris. He lived like this until the outbreak of the Great Revolution. The subsidy was interrupted, and life was very difficult, but he did not receive a royal subsidy and go to the guillotine like those nobles he knew. On the contrary, the National Assembly passed a resolution to give him a subsidy of two thousand francs per year. This was on February 7, 1793. He died the day before at six o'clock in the afternoon.

　　Less than a hundred years later, a unified Italy appeared. Beautiful Venice brings many precious gifts worth the pride of the Italian people to Italy, and Goldoni—the masterpiece of Italy's greatest comedy writer, of course, is included. He raises the people's mood of living happily and encourages them to face life. He gives the people healthy laughter, and the people give him heartfelt love.

    意大利喜剧之父哥尔多尼
    李健吾
    有谁去过威尼斯，会不爱这水上之都的？一条街是一条河。出门就得坐船。不坐船，就得顺着窄窄的人行道，走过形形色色的大桥、小桥。白天看美术品，琳琅满目，油画色彩鲜丽，砌画古意盎然。黑夜坐上小船，——有谁忘记得了名闻世界的甘道拉和站在船尾摇船的甘道里耶？他唱着歌，划过曲曲折折的小河、大河，把船上一对男女摇进了水天一色的拉古纳（内海）。日常欢愉，过年过节更加欢愉。
    1707年2月25日，近代意大利喜剧之父卡尔罗·哥尔多尼，诞生在这“娱乐之城”。
    威尼斯在当时是一个富庶的贵族共和国。从十一世纪末叶起，统治阶层利用十字军远征，发展它和东方之间的贸易，远如中国和它在商业上也有往来。元初在中国出任官职的马可波罗，就是威尼斯人。财富培养享乐。威尼斯的特殊地势是它安全的保证。但是美洲和印度航路的发现，促成大西洋东岸国家商业的兴盛。土耳其人崛起，又截断了威尼斯与东方之间的交通。十七和十八世纪之交的威尼斯，如同意大利其他贵族共和国和僭主国一样，已经走向贫困。威尼斯虽然失去文艺复兴时期的威望，可是快活两个字，许久以来，就是威尼斯生活的基本情调。逢年逢节，人人戴上假面具，不问贫富，出入高门大第的舞会。哥尔多尼就生在这变动虽不明显，然而大势已去的时代。他在他的娓娓动人的“自传”里，告诉我们，父亲（一位医生）最初安排他到远迢迢的里米尼学哲学。枯燥的经院哲学打消了他学下去的兴趣。他跟着一个跑江湖的戏班，回到家乡。父亲宽恕逃学的儿子，要他学医，在身边见习。母亲体会儿子的心情，说服父亲，放他去学法律。哥尔多尼从来不放弃他的律师头衔。不过他的出庭次数，却也实在有限。他有信心，也乐于从事的，不是辩护，而是写戏。他希望作到喜剧代替“职业喜剧”。
    什么是意大利“职业喜剧”或者“即兴喜剧”呢？
    这是文艺复兴时期兴起的剧种，意大利当时没有专业剧作家。文人写戏，全凭一时兴会。其中最成功的喜剧，首推史学家和政治家马基雅弗利的讽刺教士的世态喜剧“曼陀罗华”（1513年）。“文学喜剧”似乎对跑江湖的草台班子不起作用，它们继承的更是民间流行，古已有之的地方小戏。它们缺乏剧作家，演员以自己为中心，搜寻故事，演出后来盛行于意大利的“职业喜剧”。其所以叫做“职业喜剧”的缘故，就是因为喜剧（其实往往是“闹剧”）的演出，完全是作为职业的演员自己搞出来的。他们没有对话剧本，偶有对话，也决不完整，有的只是幕表，有的干脆只是故事纲要。熟练的合作是演出成功的重要因素。但是起决定性作用的，更是模拟的天才和精湛的演技。观众特别欢迎这些江湖艺人的“抓哏”的语言和动作。对话是他们根据故事要求，临时在台上诌出来的。即兴词令积累多了，后来演员创造不了新的，就在一定环境和一定身分之下，乱套乱用。他们扮演的角色，永远是定型人物。这些人物来自生活，经过艺人匠心塑造和舞台上成功的表演，成了一个演员终生扮演的形象。传统留下来的东西，他们也保存在人物造型上。戴假面具就是说明定型的一个重要特征。
    并非个个人物都戴假面具。男女情人不戴；妇女面部中央有时候蒙一块小黑绒（Ioup），不过这是装饰，不是假面具，因为一般妇女平时都蒙。使女不戴假面具。戴假面具的只有丑型人物。资产阶级丑型人物有两个：一个是街头艺人给威尼斯商人塑造的滑稽形象；一个是满嘴拉丁文的法学博士（后来也有医学博士）的滑稽形象，他的出生地是意大利最早设立大学的波伦亚。前者叫作巴达龙，是一个吝啬而又好色的老人，有时候承当家长这类角色。他的假面具是深棕色，鹰嘴鼻子，长灰胡子，偶尔也戴一副圆眼镜。脚上穿一双便鞋，身上披一件大黑斗篷，露出他的红衣、红裤、红袜。后者的假面具是皮肤色（也有黑色的），脸蛋涂成红的，鼻子底下有一对朝上翘的小胡子，显出了不起的模样。
    他们必须有听差，也必须受听差作弄。艺人从偏北的山城贝加摩挑了两个穷光蛋搭配。一个是机伶、刁钻的布里格拉，戴一个橄榄色假面具，一身男仆穿的制服似的装束。这种恶作剧的流氓听差，后来又以别的名称，成为那不勒斯人。另一个听差，作为对称，却是笨汉。这就是常在欧洲舞台露面的阿耳干。哥尔多尼告诉我们，他那身花花绿绿的衣服，说明他的出身，因为这是他拾来的破布拼凑成的。他的帽子插着一条兔子尾巴，贝加摩农民一直这样装璜他们的帽子〔一〕。腰里插着一把木剑。“一仆二主”里的特鲁法儿金鲁，就是阿尔干的别称，两个主人打他，用的正是他自己的木剑。他戴一个黑假面具。他是一个非常吃重的角色，要具备中国武丑的工夫。他笨，然而有他自己的智慧。天真使他可爱。闹饿、贪吃是他（一个穷人）的本色。
    这四个定型人物，说话夹杂一些本乡土白，形成意大利“职业喜剧”的标志。每个演员，扮演这样一个定型人物，在基本形象之外，加上属于自己的色彩，另取一个名称。特鲁法儿金鲁是著名演员萨基给自己演的阿耳干这个定型人物取的名称，他在任何一出戏里，都把自己叫作特鲁法儿金鲁（字义是“诡诈”）。
    这些“职业喜剧”演员，往往过的是江湖生涯。他们有时候不得不帮江湖医生在市集卖假药。哥尔多尼在米兰就遇见过这样几个艺人，白天帮江湖医生（他是一个有过几个博士学位的学者！）卖假药，夜晚点起蜡烛演闹剧。他们对他写戏起了不小的影响。这些艺人，浪迹江湖，走南闯北，在各国表演他们的绝艺。他们在巴黎有一个固定剧场。莫里哀的剧团，回到巴黎之后，最初和最后，就和意大利“职业喜剧”剧团轮流使用剧场。他们的明快的演技、戏剧的流动的空气，在莫里哀的表演艺术与剧本艺术上，留下不可否认的痕迹。他的丑型人物有时候不换名字，从“职业喜剧”方面借用过来。莎士比亚虽然出生较早，不见得对这轰动欧洲的剧种就完全陌生。至少他明确表示了他反对信口遣词的意见。哈姆雷特在第三幕第二场对伶人甲说：“还有你们那些演丑角的，只许念剧本上写下的说白，不要临时添花样”。〔二〕
    哥尔多尼在意大利十八世纪所要改革的，正是莎士比亚和莫里哀在本国所努力的方向，也正是他自己企图作到的方向。不过就改革而论，他却远比这两位外国先辈艰苦。他们“仿佛要给自然照一面镜子”〔三〕，只要举起镜子就是了，可是他举起镜子的时候，还得提防有人不要他举起镜子来。因为莎士比亚和莫里哀可以不管别一国家的“职业喜剧”的存在，然而对哥尔多尼说来，“职业喜剧”不但存在，而且已经衍成本国一种国家性质的娱乐，有悠久的历史传统，有深厚的社会基础，碰它不倒，自己反而会倒下来。
    但是“职业喜剧”进入十八世纪以后，表演落入陈陈相因的程式，即兴台词缺乏生活内容，脱离现实，例如一个情人，心怀妒忌，在任何一出戏，永远重复这几句俏皮话：“我妒忌，因为我闹恋爱。哦！多怪的矛盾。爱情像火，妒忌像冰，碰到一起，我毁定啦。它们两下里一夹攻，我有热情，也无能为力。我如今是外头打哆嗦，里头在发高烧。”〔四〕戏词再好，老听也就腻了。演员缺乏创造力，却又乱抓噱头，制造色情场面。
    哥尔多尼不欣赏“职业喜剧”，在“自传”里特别说起了一点，就是丑型演员所戴的假面具：“假面具必然常常妨害演员的悲、喜表情；谈恋爱也好，发脾气也好，或者有兴致也好，脸上的表情永远一模一样；他比手势，变化声调，但是他不能用脸传达感情；脸是内心的说明、种种使他内心激动的感情的说明。”他认为古代希腊、罗马有用假面具的必要，因为对扩音有帮助，“可是在今天，艺人必须具有灵魂；而灵魂压在假面具底下，就像火埋在灰烬底下一样。”〔五〕
    当时对“职业喜剧”抱他这样看法的，不是太多，而是太少。他又不是资本家，无法租赁一家剧场，创办一个剧团，实现自己的改革理想。他必须和一个剧团合作，通过写戏，维持家计。他原来和剧团没有关系，不像莎士比亚和莫里哀，一直待在剧团里头。他不得不一边和演员打交道，一边开导他们改变传统表演方式。幸而他有一份雄厚的本钱，那就是：写起戏来，有求必应，而且应命迅速。他有捷才，更有耐力。
    他为声名卓著的丑型演员写幕表。“一仆二主”最初的形式，只是一些详尽的提纲。1743年，哥尔多尼在皮萨执行律师业务，收到萨基从威尼斯寄来一封信，信上提供“一仆二主”的故事，希望哥尔多尼帮他写出来，由他主演特鲁法儿金鲁这个角色。萨基跟着又向他要了一出“职业喜剧”：“阿耳干的孩子失而复得”。这出闹剧还要成功，各地剧团争着上演，他后来远去巴黎，就是它做的引线，但是他认为缺点很多，没有收入他的戏剧集。他收入对话完整的“一仆二主”。这在1753年，毫无疑问，萨基的即兴创造，他也利用进来。就人物而言，这是一出典型的“职业喜剧”，四个面具人物全有（虽然布里格拉变成一个有相当身份的店主），两对情人，一个有风趣的使女，——哥尔多尼最欣赏这种花旦型演员。九个演员，或许再添上一个吹牛、胆小的队长（调侃西班牙军官的定型人物，——西班牙军队曾经长期在意大利驻扎来的），是意大利“职业喜剧”剧团的理想组织。
    成功使他和剧团的合作越发密切了。从1749年起，他和一个在威尼斯演出的剧团签订契约，每年供应八个新剧本，不算改编和应景的诗篇。他成了一个职业剧作家。剧团接受他的改革计划，鼓励演员不戴假面具，搬演对话完整的文学剧本。他在写戏之外，还要指导演员演戏，因为走进生活，不戴假面具，不是个个演员都能做的好的。他写戏快的惊人。有一年他一口气写了十六个剧本，其中有几个还是杰作。
    接近演员是他成功的一个主要条件。他从演员方面发现戏料，吸收他们的性格成为人物的性格，尽量减小他们塑造人物的困难。接近观众是他成功的另一个主要条件。他像莫里哀一样，看重池座观众的口碑。包厢在威尼斯，也像在意大利其他城市一样，变成富贵人家的俱乐部或者会客室。宾主围着一张牌桌，说东道西，除非一时高兴，才会安静下来看戏。他们不朝池座唾一口痰下来，已经恩德无穷。池座观众另是一回事了。他们真懂戏，看到精采地方就喊好，一不满意就打嘘。池座发黑，没有几枝蜡烛点在这里，先来的观众摸到硬板凳，坐下来等人收钱（平均是一角钱），后来的只好站着。哥尔多尼尊重他们。他拿他认为最好的作品留在威尼斯上演。他为他们写出他的最好的喜剧，特别是用威尼斯语言写的威尼斯风光的世态杰作。他对穷苦观众特别有好感。他的敌手骂他巴结贱氓，他谈起他的杰作“可敬的姑娘”，曾经在“自传”里记载道：
    “这出喜剧有些场面，我照自然的样子，把威尼斯的甘道里耶（船夫）描画出来，熟悉我的故乡的语言和风俗的人们觉得非常有趣。
    “这应当受人注意的听差阶层不满意我，我希望同他们和好。
    “池座不满的时候，威尼斯的甘道里耶可以上剧场看戏，不过他们看不到我的喜剧，只好在街头或者船上等候他们的主人散戏出来。他们说起我来，用上一些可笑的怪话，我也听到过。所以我在剧场角落给他们安排了一个地方看戏，台上演的又是他们自己，他们看的很开心。我和他们成了朋友。”〔六〕
    他是白描胜手。他不费力气，就自自然然把生活搬上舞台，再从发展上，自自然然把戏结束了。在这一方面，他奉为师法的莫里哀就不如他。他重视性格，把自己的一些喜剧称为性格喜剧，但是在这一方面，他显然没有达到莫里哀的造诣的最高水平。他和莫里哀一样，永远追寻事件的道德意义，虽然他缺乏前辈的鞭挞精神或者战斗精神。他写“可敬的姑娘”（1749年），因为他看到一出伤风败俗的闹剧，糟蹋一个“没有才分、没有道德”的姑娘。在他看来，用他自己的话：“喜剧是，或者应当是一个教人学好的学校，暴露人类弱点，只为改正这些弱点”。〔七〕不过他不是一位道学先生，有意把道德放在第一位。他通过生活本身教育观众。望而生畏的感觉是和他的喜剧格格不相入的。他要他的本乡观众笑个畅快，他赢得观众的嫟称“爸爸哥尔多尼”。1760年9月24日，欧洲“无冕之王”服尔泰，从法国写信给他道：
      “我的先生、自然的画家和儿子，自我读你的作品以来，我就爱你。我从你的作品看见你的灵魂。我说：这是一位正直、善良的人，他洁化了意大利舞台，创造有想像，行文有识见。哦！多丰盈呀，我的先生！多纯洁呀！就我看来，风格极其自然、诙谐与妩媚。你由胡闹的迷障救出了你的祖国。”〔八〕
    “女店主”（1753年）这出喜剧，恰好说明“自然、诙谐与妩媚”的评语。我们在1927年有过这出风行欧洲的喜剧杰作的改译本。〔九〕这里不是威尼斯风光。福罗伦萨是故事发生的地点。阶级关系通过人物，在戏里得到鲜明的对比。三个不同等级的贵族男子，一个奴隶身分的伙计，但是属于资产阶级的店家小姐，不选前者，却选后者做丈夫。我们决没有意思强调这些阶级对比，但是由于哥尔多尼的玲珑的笔致，对比自然而有趣地，通过性格语言，活在我们面前。三个贵人，一个身分高似一个，侯爵、伯爵、骑士，住在一家客店。店主已经去世了，留下一个女儿，遗言要她嫁给店里一个得力的伙计。年轻貌美的米郎道莉娜，当时由花旦型演员扮演，说明她的性格含有聪明、活泼和打情骂俏的成分。她不希望马上戴结婚戒指，可是在她得乐且乐的时候，她也相当矜持，或者不如说是相当骄傲而又谦虚。她发现新来的骑士是一个对女人没有礼貌的人。她要他知道知道女人的厉害。惩罚的结果是这个野男人像疯狗一样爱她。她拒绝了另外两位贵人的保护，决定嫁给等着她嫁的伙计：丈夫是合法的保护人。有些法文和德文译本，改成她和骑士结婚，完全歪扭了她的性格和哥尔多尼对这样一个真诚性格的值得赞美的认识。戏里最滑稽的人物是那位落魄侯爵，一边口口声声保护她，一边偷骑士送她的金酒瓶。服尔泰写信给哥尔多尼，打趣道：“我一直有意请求侯爵对我加以保护。”〔十〕
    哥尔多尼写了一百五十多出戏。绝大部分是他远离祖国之前写的。喜剧技巧在他已经到了烂熟地步。他在“自传”里告诉我们，他能在极短期间把戏写出来，靠他有热情，也靠他技巧熟练：“通过时间、经验和习惯，我对喜剧技巧非常熟，故事构成，人物选定，此外对我也就是例行公事而已。写成一出戏，我在修改结束以前，先要完成四种工作。第一种工作：计划，区分，三个主要部分，开场、纠纷、收场。第二种工作：分幕，分场。第三种工作，主要各场的对话。第四种工作：全剧的一般对话。
    “常常发生这种情形，我在最后一种工作中，改换我在第二、第三种工作上写成的东西；因为观念接踵而至，前一场产生后一场；一句偶得的表现提供一个新的思想。我在若干时后，能把四种工作缩成一种工作；心里有计划，三个区分也有，我立刻就开始写第一幕第一场，一直写到结尾，总想着这句格言：全部线索应该在一个确定之点告终，就是说，应该在动作上升之中告终：它是全部机器开动的主要目的”。〔十一〕
    但是他的超额写作，不曾从剧团资方收到分文超额贴补。甚至于他在威尼斯付印自己的剧本，一切权益，不得资方许可，他也无权过问。威尼斯人民喜爱的“爸爸哥尔多尼”，不得不在威尼斯最后几年，低声下气，常向资方写这种告乏的信：“现在，说真的，银钱问题成了我的首要问题。我的兄弟和我在一起。我必须偿还他在摩得那留下的债务；我必须给他做衣服，找工作。我没有钱，今天我向人借了六个塞干（约合七十佛郎）。”〔十二〕
    生活困难，他对“职业喜剧”的改革，又给他招致了种种不愉快的打击。他是一个资产阶级知识分子，歌颂资产阶级道德的时候，把同情给了“下等人”，又如实写出了贵人的恶行败德。他热爱故乡，但是他的精神向往于意大利的统一。他不过问政治，实际他的进步思想使他成为一个国家事业的工作者，并不限于地方性的艺术活动。人民欢迎他的宽阔的笑、他的深厚的笑。然而有些贵人，醉心过去，对他非常不满。威尼斯共和国的十人委员会不同意给他津贴。他经常读到攻讦的文字。服尔泰在哥尔多尼离开威尼斯之前，给他们的共同朋友写信，用诗表示他的忿慨道：
      “他们不知道该用
    什么样的理由裁判
    他的作品，请自然
    来当官司的仲裁人。
    自然就老实不客气
    对批评家和敌手说道：
      ‘个个作家有缺点，
    哥尔多尼却把我画出来’。”〔十三〕
    哥尔多尼决计接受巴黎“职业喜剧”剧团的邀约，去了法兰西。他写了一出寓言喜剧“狂欢节最后一夕”，向他的亲爱的威尼斯观众告别，行前他去看这出喜剧上演，听见池座观众喊着“一路平安！”“再见！”“一定要回来！”他在“自传”里谦逊道：“我承认我很感动，甚至于流下了眼泪。”〔十四〕
    他在巴黎住下来（1762年），一直住到去世（对威尼斯和喜剧来说，该是多大的损失！）。他在路易十五的宫廷教意大利文。他瞎了一只眼睛。他用法文写了一出喜剧杰作“善心的急性人”（1771年），法兰西喜剧院的演出轰动一时。国王给了他一笔津贴（教意大利文的代价），维持他在巴黎的生活。他就这样活到大革命爆发。津贴中断了，日子过的很苦，但是他并没有因为领受王室津贴，像他认识的那些贵人一样上了断头台。相反，国民大会通过决议，每年给他两千佛郎津贴。这在1793年2月7日。他在头一天下午六时去世。
    相隔不到一百年，出现了统一的意大利。美丽的威尼斯给意大利带来许多值得意大利人民骄傲的名贵的礼物，哥尔多尼——意大利最大的喜剧作家的杰作，当然在内。他提高人民乐生的情绪，鼓励他们面向生活。他给人民健康的笑，人民给他衷心的爱。
