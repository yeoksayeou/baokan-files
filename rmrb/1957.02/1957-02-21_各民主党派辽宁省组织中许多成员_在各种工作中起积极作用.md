Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, February 19th: Encouraged by the principle of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision," the local organizations of various democratic parties in Liaoning Province are extremely active in their work.

Many members of the local organizations of various democratic parties in Liaoning Province have participated in the management of local state affairs. Currently, members of democratic parties account for more than 36% of the Liaoning Provincial People's Committee and 24.57% of the Second People's Congress of Shenyang City. Many members also hold important positions in state organs, enterprises, schools, and scientific research institutions. According to incomplete statistics, ten people hold positions as vice-governors and vice-mayors, and eight people hold positions as directors of departments and bureaus of the Provincial People's Committee.

Under the education of various democratic party organizations, many members are playing an active role in various tasks in government offices, schools, and enterprises; some members have made outstanding contributions to socialist construction. Li Xun, member of the preparatory committee of the Shenyang branch of the Jiusan Society, Ge Tingsui, a member of the society, Peng Shaoyi, Guo Xiexian, Zhang Yuanqi, and Zhang Cunhao, members of the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League, received the 1956 Science Award issued by the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Mao Zongliang, a member of the preparatory committee of the Shenyang branch of the Jiusan Society, achieved success in the experiment and research of "increasing the yield of autumn-harvested peas" and has received social attention.

Among the members of the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association, 20% are advanced workers. Recently, fifty-eight members of the China Association for Promoting Democracy in Shenyang middle schools were recognized as advanced workers in the education system.

The local organizations of various democratic parties, according to the different classes and strata they can represent, have contacted a segment of the masses and are working on them. For example, from last year to the present, the Liaoning Provincial and Shenyang Municipal Committees of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang have contacted more than 500 people from various circles scattered in society, and have conducted patriotic and socialist education on them through learning, visits, and recreational activities. Members of the local organizations of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang and the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League in Liaoning Province have also actively participated in the propaganda work for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan. Last year, the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League held "Lectures on Scientific Research Issues" in Shenyang and Dalian, with a total audience of more than 7,000 people, which promoted the development of scientific research work.

The supervisory role of the local organizations of various democratic parties and their members on the work of the Chinese Communist Party and state organs is becoming increasingly significant. Not long ago, when the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party invited various democratic parties and non-party democratic personages to examine the party's united front work, they criticized some grassroots organizations of the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party for neglecting the united front policy; they criticized certain units for not providing enough political assistance to members of democratic parties, not paying attention to bringing their organizational role into play, and raising criticisms and suggestions on issues related to the policy on intellectuals and the march towards science, helping the party to correct shortcomings in its work.

The local organizations of various democratic parties have developed greatly. In the second half of last year and early February of this year, the new members developed by the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League were equivalent to 110% of the development in the past four years. The China Association for Promoting Democracy formally established the Liaoning Provincial Preparatory Committee in January of this year, and the number of members has increased from 160 to 662; the members of other democratic parties have also increased significantly.

    各民主党派辽宁省组织中许多成员
    在各种工作中起积极作用
    新华社沈阳19日电　各民主党派辽宁省地方组织，在“长期共存、互相监督”的方针鼓舞下，工作极为活跃。
    各民主党派辽宁省地方组织的许多成员，参加了地方国家事务管理工作。目前，民主党派的成员在省人民委员会里占36％以上，在沈阳市第二届人民代表大会里占24.57％。许多成员还在国家机关、企业、学校、科学研究机关担任重要职务。据不完全统计，担任副省长、副市长的有十人，担任省人民委员会厅、局长的有八人。
    在各民主党派组织的教育下，许多成员在机关、学校和企业的各种工作中起着积极作用；有些成员在社会主义建设中有突出的贡献。九三学社沈阳分社筹委会的成员李熏、社员葛庭燧、中国民主同盟辽宁省委员会的盟员彭少逸、郭燮贤、章元琦、张存浩等，获得中国科学院颁发的1956年度科学奖金。九三学社沈阳分社筹委会社员毛宗良，在“提高秋收豌豆产量”试验、研究中取得成绩，受到社会上重视。
    中国民主建国会沈阳市委员会成员中，有20％是先进工作者。最近，沈阳市中学有五十八个民进会员被评为教育系统的先进工作者。
    各民主党派辽宁省地方组织按其各自可代表的不同阶级、阶层，联系了一部分群众，并对他们进行工作。如中国国民党革命委员会辽宁省和沈阳市委员会，从去年到现在，联系了散在社会上的各方面人士五百多人，通过学习、参观、文娱活动等方式，对他们进行了爱国主义和社会主义教育。民革和台湾民主自治同盟在辽宁省的地方组织成员，还积极参加了和平解放台湾的宣传工作。民盟辽宁省委员会去年在沈阳、旅大两市举办了“科学研究问题讲座”，听众共达七千多人，推动了科学研究工作的开展。
    各民主党派地方组织和其成员，在对中国共产党和国家机关工作的监督作用日益显著。不久前，中共辽宁省委邀请各民主党派及无党派民主人士检查党的统一战线工作时，他们对中共辽宁省有些基层组织忽视统一战线政策进行了批评；对某些单位在政治上帮助民主党派成员不够，不注意发挥他们的组织作用，以及对有关知识分子政策和向科学进军中存在着的问题都提出批评和建议，帮助党纠正了工作中的缺点。
    各民主党派地方组织有了很大发展。去年下半年和今年2月初，中国民主同盟辽宁省委员会新发展的成员，相当于过去四年以来发展的110％。中国民主促进会在今年1月正式成立了辽宁省筹委会，会员已由一百六十人，增到六百六十二人；其他民主党派的成员也增加很多。
