When the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance celebrates its seventh anniversary, the Chinese people are celebrating this historically significant day for China and the Soviet Union with exceptional excitement, celebrating the increasingly close friendship between our two peoples and the increasingly consolidated Sino-Soviet alliance, and celebrating the ever-growing influence and role of this alliance in safeguarding world peace and the cause of human progress.

Over the past seven years, the brotherly relations of friendship and cooperation between our two countries have greatly developed. Our two countries have always supported each other and united as one to jointly struggle for the lofty cause of maintaining world peace and human progress, and have made great contributions. Thanks to the efforts of Korea, China, the Soviet Union, and all peace-loving people, the American imperialist-launched war of aggression against Korea was shamefully defeated. Thanks to the efforts of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Soviet Union, China and other countries, peace was restored in Indochina, where war had lasted for eight years. China and the Soviet Union jointly pursue a foreign policy of peace and international cooperation, actively striving for the relaxation of the international situation. China and the Soviet Union firmly advocate peaceful coexistence among countries with different social systems, and oppose the arms race and the war policies of exclusive military blocs. China and the Soviet Union jointly support the national independence movements of all oppressed countries and oppose the imperialist policy of colonial aggression. China and the Soviet Union jointly opposed the Anglo-French-Israeli war of aggression against Egypt and strongly condemned the US "Eisenhower Doctrine" aggression plan aimed at enslaving the people of the Middle East. Since last October, China and the Soviet Union have made significant efforts to further strengthen the unity of socialist countries. Following the Soviet Union's assistance, at the request of the Hungarian government and people, in quelling the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Hungary and saving the socialist cause in Hungary, the great achievements of the Sino-Soviet talks and the talks between China and the Soviet Union and other socialist countries are of great significance for further strengthening the Sino-Soviet brotherly alliance and the unity of the entire socialist camp. All these facts prove that China and the Soviet Union are in complete agreement in defending the just cause of mankind. All these facts also prove that the great Sino-Soviet alliance and the unbreakable unity of the two countries have an increasingly profound influence and role in world peace and the cause of human progress. This alliance has become an important pillar of world peace and human progress.

The close cooperation between China and the Soviet Union and the further consolidation of the Sino-Soviet alliance are not only manifested in the mutual assistance and support between China and the Soviet Union in the struggle to defend peace and maintain the cause of human progress, but also in the increasingly close cooperation between China and the Soviet Union in the political, economic and cultural fields. The Soviet Union has consistently supported our country's struggle to safeguard independence and sovereignty, and advocates the restoration of our country's seat in the United Nations and the restoration of our country's sovereignty over Taiwan. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Soviet Union has provided our country with large-scale selfless assistance in the economic field, and this assistance has become an extremely important condition for our country to smoothly carry out economic construction. The Chinese people will always be grateful for this brotherly assistance from the Soviet Union, which is full of internationalist spirit. At the same time, we must continue to learn from the Soviet Union with humility and sincerity, and learn and apply the advanced experience and science and technology of the Soviet Union in accordance with the characteristics of our country, so as to smoothly develop our socialist construction cause.

The Chinese people have fully experienced from their own experience that the great alliance and friendly unity between China and the Soviet Union are not only related to the fundamental interests of our two countries, but also to the fundamental interests of world peace and the cause of human progress. Therefore, our people will continue to do everything possible to strengthen and consolidate the great Sino-Soviet alliance and the friendly unity of the two peoples. The alliance and unity between China and the Soviet Union are based on common ideas and common goals of struggle, so they are eternal and unbreakable. All the conspiracies and tricks of imperialism to undermine the alliance and unity between our two countries are just like an ant trying to shake the Great Wall, and can only end in miserable failure.

On this day of warmly celebrating the seventh anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, the imperialist forces that have suffered bankruptcy in carrying out counter-revolutionary subversion in Hungary and military adventures in Egypt are still not reconciled to their failure, and they are still continuing various acts of aggression and sabotage. The American aggressive bloc is continuing to expand its armaments and prepare for war, stepping up the implementation of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" aggressive plan to enslave the people of the Middle East, and restoring the "Cold War" to obstruct the trend of relaxation in the international situation. The imperialist bloc headed by the United States is still trying its best to undermine the unity of socialist countries and continue to carry out subversive activities against socialist countries. Therefore, we must continue to be vigilant and protect the fraternal alliance between China and the Soviet Union and the fraternal unity of socialist countries like protecting our own eyeballs. As long as the great alliance between China and the Soviet Union is more consolidated, as long as the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union are more united, and as long as all peace-loving countries and people in the world unite more closely, all the conspiracies and tricks of the imperialists against peace and the cause of progress will not escape the fate of failure. No force in the world can stop the sun from rising, and no force can stop the advance of peace and the cause of human progress.

### 亲密的友谊、巩固的同盟

    亲密的友谊、巩固的同盟
    当中苏友好同盟互助条约签订七周年的时候，中国人民怀着异常兴奋的心情，庆祝这个对中苏两国具有历史意义的日子，庆祝我们两国人民的亲密友谊越来越密切和中苏同盟越来越巩固，庆祝这个同盟对保卫世界和平和人类进步事业所发生的越来越大的影响和作用。
    七年来，我们两国兄弟般的友好合作关系有了巨大的发展。我们两国始终互相支援和团结一致地为维护世界和平和人类进步的崇高事业而共同奋斗，并且已经作出了巨大的贡献。由于朝鲜、中国、苏联和一切爱好和平人民的努力，使美帝国主义发动的侵朝战争可耻地失败了。由于越南民主共和国和苏联、中国等国的努力，使战争持续了八年之久的印度支那恢复了和平。中苏两国共同实行和平和国际合作的对外政策，积极为争取国际局势的缓和而斗争。中苏两国坚决主张不同社会制度国家的和平共处，反对扩军备战和排它性的军事集团的战争政策。中苏两国共同支持一切被压迫国家的民族独立运动，反对帝国主义的殖民侵略政策。中苏两国共同反对英法以侵略埃及的战争，并强烈谴责以奴役中近东人民为目的的美国“艾森豪威尔主义”的侵略计划。去年10月以来，中苏两国更为进一步加强社会主义国家的团结作了重大的努力。继苏联应匈牙利政府和人民的请求，帮助平息了匈牙利的反革命叛乱，拯救了匈牙利的社会主义事业之后，中苏会谈和中苏两国和其他社会主义国家会谈的巨大成就，对于进一步加强中苏兄弟同盟和整个社会主义阵营的团结具有重大的意义。这一切事实证明，中苏两国在捍卫人类正义事业中的行动是完全一致的。这一切事实也证明，伟大的中苏同盟和两国牢不可破的团结，对世界和平和人类进步事业所起的影响和作用愈来愈深远。这个同盟已经成为世界和平和人类进步事业的重要支柱。
    中苏两国的亲密合作和中苏同盟的更加巩固，不仅表现在中苏两国在保卫和平和维护人类进步事业斗争中的相互帮助和相互支援，而且还表现在中苏两国在政治、经济和文化方面的合作已经越来越密切。苏联一贯支持我国维护独立和主权的斗争，主张恢复我国在联合国的席位和恢复我国在台湾的主权。自中华人民共和国成立以来，苏联在经济上对我国进行了规模巨大的无私的援助，这些援助成为我国顺利进行经济建设的极其重要的条件。中国人民将永远怀着感激的心情，感谢苏联这种充满国际主义精神的兄弟般的援助。同时，我们必须继续虚心而认真地向苏联学习，根据我国的特点来学习和运用苏联的先进经验和科学技术，以便顺利地发展我国的社会主义建设事业。
    中国人民从切身的经验中充分地体验到，中苏两国的伟大同盟和友好团结不仅关系到我们两国的根本利益，而且关系到世界和平和人类进步事业的根本利益。因此，我国人民将继续以全力来加强和巩固伟大的中苏同盟和两国人民的友好团结。中苏两国的同盟和团结，是建立在共同的思想和共同的奋斗目标的基础之上的，因此是永恒的、牢不可破的。帝国主义千方百计地企图破坏我们两国的同盟和团结的一切阴谋诡计，不过像一只蚍蜉想去撼动万里长城一样，都只能遭到可怜的失败。
    在热烈庆祝中苏友好同盟互助条约签订七周年的今天，在匈牙利进行反革命颠覆和在埃及进行军事冒险已经遭受破产的帝国主义势力，仍然不甘心于他们的失败，他们仍在继续进行各种侵略和破坏活动。美国侵略集团正继续扩军备战，加紧实施奴役中近东人民的“艾森豪威尔主义”的侵略计划，并恢复“冷战”，以阻挠国际局势的趋向缓和。以美国为首的帝国主义集团仍竭力企图破坏社会主义国家的团结，继续进行对社会主义国家的颠覆活动。因此，我们必须继续提高警惕，像保护自己的眼珠一样来保护中苏兄弟同盟和社会主义各国的兄弟团结。只要中苏两国的伟大同盟更加巩固，只要以苏联为首的社会主义国家更加团结，只要世界上一切爱好和平的国家和人民更加紧密地联合起来，帝国主义者的一切反对和平、反对进步事业的阴谋诡计都不能逃避失败的命运。世界上没有任何力量能够阻止太阳的上升，同样也没有任何力量能够阻止和平和人类进步事业的前进。
