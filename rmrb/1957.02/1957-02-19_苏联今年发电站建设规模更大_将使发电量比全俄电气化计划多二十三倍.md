The Soviet Union will further expand the construction of power stations this year. The electricity generation this year will reach 211.2 billion kilowatt-hours, which is twenty-three times more than the GOELRO plan.

The Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station will be fully put into production. By the end of this year, the generating capacity of this hydroelectric station will reach 2.1 million kilowatts, surpassing the Grand Coulee Dam in the United States and becoming the world's largest power station. The construction of the Saratov Hydroelectric Station on the Volga River will be expanded, and the construction of the Stalingrad Hydroelectric Station will be accelerated. Construction of the Lower Volga Hydroelectric Station will begin. Four generators of the Irkutsk Hydroelectric Station under construction will begin to transmit electricity this year. This year, the total power generation of hydroelectric stations in the Soviet Union will increase to 34.6 billion kilowatt-hours, an increase of 19% compared with last year.

The construction of thermal power stations will be further expanded. This year, thermal power stations with a generating capacity of 800,000 to 1,200,000 kilowatts will be built, and generators with a generating capacity of 300,000 to 500,000 kilowatts will be designed and manufactured. The construction of atomic power stations will also be expanded and increased.

The European part of the transmission network will be further unified this year. With the completion of the Kuibyshev-Moscow transmission line, the transmission line from Kuibyshev to the Urals will be completed this year. 10,000 kilometers of transmission lines will be erected this year.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 18th. The Soviet Union will build the last cascade of hydroelectric stations on the Volga River – the Lower Volga Hydroelectric Station – in the lower reaches of the Volga River. The Soviet Ministry of Power Stations recently discussed the construction design plan for this hydroelectric station.

According to the design, this ninth hydroelectric station on the Volga River will be built in the Yenotayevka District in the central part of the Astrakhan Oblast. Its generating capacity will be approximately 1.2 million kilowatts. The reservoir of the future hydroelectric station will be directly connected to the reservoir of the Stalingrad Hydroelectric Station, the seventh cascade of power stations on the Volga River.

The Lower Volga Hydroelectric Station will play a major role in the development of agriculture and fisheries in the lower reaches of the Volga River. After its completion, the comprehensive transformation and utilization of the entire Volga River will be basically completed. At that time, the channel of this largest river in Europe, 3,690 kilometers long, will be filled with man-made seas. The Lower Volga Hydroelectric Station and the previous eight cascades on the Volga River—Ivankovo, Uglich, Shcherbakov, Gorky, Cheboksary, Kuibyshev, Stalingrad, and Saratov hydroelectric stations—will fully develop the water resources of this great river to serve the Soviet national economy. Their total generating capacity will exceed the generating capacity of all forty-five hydroelectric stations on the Tennessee River in the United States several times over.

Currently, five of the nine cascades of hydroelectric stations on the Volga River have been built and are generating electricity. Among the hydroelectric stations under construction, the Stalingrad Hydroelectric Station will soon be completed, and the Saratov and Cheboksary hydroelectric stations are already in the preparatory stage of construction. After these three hydroelectric stations and the Lower Volga Hydroelectric Station are completed, the old appearance of the Volga River will be completely changed. Huge man-made seas, magnificent hydroelectric stations, numerous navigation locks and canals will make the Volga a major artery connecting five seas, and become the power supply center of the European part of the Soviet Union.

    苏联今年发电站建设规模更大
    将使发电量比全俄电气化计划多二十三倍
    本报莫斯科18日电　今年苏联将进一步扩大建设发电站。今年发电量将达二千一百一十二亿度，这个数字比全俄电气化计划多二十三倍。
    古比雪夫水电站将全部投入生产。到今年年底这个水电站的发电能力将达二百一十万瓩，超过美国的格兰德·库里水电站而成为世界上最大的发电站。将扩大建设伏尔加河上的萨拉托夫水电站和加速建设斯大林格勒水电站。下伏尔加河水电站将开始建设。建设中的伊尔库次克水电站今年将有四部发电机开始送电。今年全苏水电站的发电量将增到三百四十六亿度，即比去年增加19％。
    热电站的建设将进一步扩大。今年将建成发电能力共八十万到一百二十万瓩的热电站，并将设计和制造发电能力三十万到五十万瓩的发电机。原子发电站的建设也将扩大和增加。
    欧洲一部分输电网今年将进一步统一起来。随着古比雪夫莫斯科输电线的完工，今年将完成从古比雪夫到乌拉尔的输电线。今年将可架起一万公里的输电线。
    新华社莫斯科18日电　苏联将在伏尔加河下游建造伏尔加河上最后一个水力发电站梯级——下伏尔加水电站。苏联电站部最近已经讨论了这个水电站的施工设计方案。
    根据设计，这个伏尔加河上的第九个水电站将建设在阿斯特拉罕州中部的叶诺塔耶夫卡区。它的发电能力将约为一百二十万瓩。未来的水电站水库将直接和伏尔加河上的第七个发电站梯级斯大林格勒水电站的水库联结起来。
    下伏尔加水电站对发展伏尔加河下游地区的农业和渔业将起重大的作用。它建成以后，整个伏尔加河的综合改造利用工作就将基本上完成。那时候，这条三千六百九十公里长的欧洲最大的河流的河道就将被一个个的人工海所布满。下伏尔加水电站和伏尔加河上的前八个梯级——伊凡科沃、乌格列奇、谢巴科夫、高尔基、契鲍克萨利、古比雪夫、斯大林格勒和萨拉托夫水电站——将把这条大河流的水力资源完全开发出来，为苏联国民经济服务。它们的总发电能力将超过美国田纳西河上所有四十五个水电站的发电能力的好几倍。
    目前，伏尔加河上的九个水力发电站梯级中，已经有五个建成和发电。在未建成的水电站中，斯大林格勒水电站很快就将建成，萨拉托夫和契鲍克萨利水电站已经在进行施工的准备工作。在这三个水电站和下伏尔加水电站建成以后，伏尔加河旧日的景象就将完全改变。巨大的人工海、雄伟的水电站、许多通航水闸和运河将使伏尔加成为五海通航的大动脉，成为苏联欧洲部分的供电中心。
