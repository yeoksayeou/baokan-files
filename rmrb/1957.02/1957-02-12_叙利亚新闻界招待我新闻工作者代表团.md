Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, 11th: Damascus journalists held a cocktail party on the evening of the 10th to entertain the Chinese journalists delegation visiting Syria.

Syrian Minister of State Akil, Minister of Agriculture Khoja, Acting Secretary-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Janzi, members of parliament, and foreign diplomats attended the cocktail party. Chen Zhifang, the Chinese Ambassador to Syria, was also invited to attend.

Representatives from many foreign newspapers also attended the cocktail party.

Reyes, the person in charge of "Al-Balad" newspaper, said in his welcoming speech that the name People's Republic of China is written in our hearts, and the connection between hearts is stronger than the connection between relatives and neighbors. He thanked the Chinese people for their full support to Egypt and the Arab people in resisting aggression.

He said: The Soviet Union, China, and other socialist countries were the first to condemn the aggression in various international organizations. Later, the historically significant warnings issued by the Soviet Union and China made the aggressors tremble with fear, forcing them to cease fire and withdraw from Egyptian territory. This proves that the Soviet Union, China, and other democratic countries are strong supporters of small countries and reliable friends in times of trouble.

Jiang Yuanchun, the head of the Chinese journalists delegation, expressed gratitude for the warm reception from the Syrian government and people. He said: Imperialists are trying to isolate Syria because they do not like Syria's policy of peace and neutrality. But the imperialists will inevitably suffer a shameful defeat.

From February 3rd to February 8th, the Chinese journalists delegation visited the cities of Homs, Aleppo, and Latakia in Syria.

    叙利亚新闻界招待我新闻工作者代表团
    新华社大马士革11日电　大马士革新闻工作者10日晚举行鸡尾酒会，招待中国新闻工作者访问叙利亚代表团。
    叙利亚国务部长阿基勒、农业部长霍贾、外交部代理秘书长詹济、议员和外国外交人员参加了酒会。中国驻叙利亚大使陈志方也应邀出席了酒会。
    出席酒会的还有许多外国报纸的代表。
    “巴拉达报”负责人拉耶斯在致欢迎词的时候说，中华人民共和国这个名称是写在我们心上的，心和心的联系要比亲属间邻居间的联系更加牢固。他感谢中国人民对埃及和阿拉伯人民反抗侵略所给予的充分的支持。
    他说：苏联、中国和其他社会主义国家首先在各国际机构中谴责了侵略行动。后来苏联和中国发出的具有历史意义的警告，使侵略者害怕得发抖，迫使他们停火和撤离埃及领土。这证明了苏联、中国和其他民主国家是小国的强有力的支持者，并且是它们在患难时可以信赖的朋友。
    中国新闻工作者代表团团长蒋元椿对叙利亚政府和人民的热情招待表示感谢。他说：帝国主义者企图孤立叙利亚，因为他们不喜欢叙利亚的和平和中立政策。但是帝国主义者将必然遭到可耻的失败。
    从2月3日到2月8日，中国新闻工作者代表团在叙利亚访问了霍姆斯、阿勒颇和拉塔基亚等城市。
