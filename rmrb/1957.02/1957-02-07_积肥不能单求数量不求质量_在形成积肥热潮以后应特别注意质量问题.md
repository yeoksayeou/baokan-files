Accumulating Fertilizer Should Not Focus Solely on Quantity and Neglect Quality
Special Attention Should be Paid to Quality Issues After a Fertilizer Accumulation Upsurge Forms
    (Our report) According to the Qinghai Daily: Huangzhong County is carrying out various spring plowing preparation works intensely. Because of relaxing fertilizer accumulation work in the summer and autumn of last year, in addition, many cooperatives set the fertilizer price too low, some cooperatives set the price of a large bag of manure at only three to six cents, and the problems of cooperative members burning firewood, warming beds, and soil for livestock bedding were not well resolved, so the amount of fertilizer accumulated by October last year accounted for only about 30% of the total fertilizer accumulated in the whole year of 1955. After the leading organs of Huangzhong County discovered this problem, they took effective measures in time to solve the problems of members transporting soil to pad the pens, burning firewood and warming the beds; they adjusted the fertilizer price and paid or prepaid the fertilizer price; they promoted cooperatives and members to sign contracts, and formulated specific fertilizer accumulation plans, which stimulated the enthusiasm of members to accumulate fertilizer. Therefore, a widespread upsurge in fertilizer accumulation was set off. All localities actively scraped hearth ash, dismantled old beds, old walls, and old stoves, swept road soil, picked up manure, and accumulated fertilizer from all aspects. According to the statistics of 14 cooperatives in Anhuai Township, 1,533 loads of cattle manure were picked up from the mountains, and the whole township had already delivered manure to 1,355 mu of land. Xin Zhuang, Ya Xin, Xuan Ma Wan and other cooperatives in Weixin Township will be able to deliver all the fertilizer to the fields before the Spring Festival. Although the fertilizer accumulation work is better than before, after the contract was signed and the fertilizer price was adjusted, some members, in order to get more money, developed a tendency to only seek quantity and not quality. The fertilizer they accumulated had more soil and less manure, or they started the fertilizer before it was fully fermented, and some even started the pen manure two months in advance. This is the result of the lack of clear regulations on quality in the fertilizer pricing standard, and the relaxation of collective education for members.

    积肥不能单求数量不求质量
    在形成积肥热潮以后应特别注意质量问题
    本报讯　据青海日报报道：湟中县各项春耕准备工作正在紧张进行。由于去年夏秋两季放松了积肥工作，加之不少社肥价定的过低，有的社一大袋粪才三分至六分钱，社员烧柴、煨炕、垫圈土等问题没有得到很好解决，因而到去年10月积肥数量才占1955年全年积肥总数的30％左右。湟中县领导机关发现这一问题后，及时采取了有效措施，解决了社员驮土垫圈、烧柴煨炕等问题；调整了肥料价款，现付或预付了肥价；推行了社与社员订立合同，制定了具体积肥计划，激发了社员积肥的积极性。因此，广泛地掀起了一个积肥热潮。各地都积极扒炕灰、拆旧炕、旧墙、旧锅头，扫路土、拾粪，从各方面进行积肥。据安怀乡十四个社的统计，从山上拾的牛粪就有一千五百三十三驮，全乡已送粪一千三百五十五亩。维新乡新庄，押心、轩马弯等社在春节前即可将肥料全部送到地里。虽然目前积肥工作比以前作的好了，但是，在订立合同和肥价调整后，一些社员为了多得价款，产生了只求数量、不求质量的偏向，他们积的肥料中土多粪少，或沤不到时候就起粪，甚至有提前两个月起圈粪的。这是在肥料作价标准中对质量缺乏明确的规定，并且放松了对社员进行集体主义教育的结果。
