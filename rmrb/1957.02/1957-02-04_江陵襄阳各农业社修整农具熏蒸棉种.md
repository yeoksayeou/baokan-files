    Jiangling and Xiangyang Agricultural Cooperatives Repair Farm Tools and Fumigate Cotton Seeds
    (Our report) In mid-January, the Jiangling County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party organized two work teams to delve into the rice and cotton growing areas respectively, to specifically investigate the problems existing in this year's spring plowing production. The work teams found that the farm tools in Jiudian Township in the rice growing area were badly damaged and there was a serious shortage of fertilizer, and that cotton seed selection and the elimination of overwintering bollworms in Jingxi Township in the cotton growing area were insufficient. At a recent telephone conference of all townships in the county, the County Party Committee requested all localities to seize the opportunity and make preparations for spring plowing in accordance with local conditions. At present, 373 agricultural cooperatives in the county have completed the work of cleaning up farm tools.
    Xiangyang County organized eleven technical cadres to specialize in the fumigation of cotton seeds, and has now fumigated more than 1.2 million jin; and transferred 400,000 jin of Daizi cotton seeds to agricultural cooperatives in cotton producing areas such as Xiangbei. More than 300,000 mu of spring seedbeds in the county have generally been plowed one to two times; in addition to the complete plowing of more than 140,000 mu of Ban fields, the rice stubble has also been picked up completely. At the same time, various localities have also taken many effective measures to protect and fatten draft animals.

    江陵襄阳各农业社修整农具熏蒸棉种
    本报讯　1月中旬，中共江陵县委组织两个工作组分别深入到水稻和棉花两种地区，具体调查今年春耕生产存在哪些问题。工作组发现水稻地区九店乡的农具损坏很大、缺肥很多，棉花地区荆西乡的棉子选种和消灭越冬红铃虫很不够；另外耕牛掉膘和缺牛现象也比较普遍。在最近召开的全县各乡电话会议上，县委要求各地抓紧时机，因地制宜地作好春耕准备。目前全县已有三百七十三个农业社作好了农具的清理工作。
    襄阳县组织十一个技术干部专门作棉子的熏蒸工作，现在已熏蒸了一百二十多万斤；并将四十万斤岱字棉种调运到襄北等产棉区的农业社里。全县三十多万亩春炕地已普遍犁了一道到两道；十四万多亩坂田除全部翻耕外，谷蔸也拣得一干二净。同时各地对耕畜保膘养肥工作，也采取了许多有效措施。
