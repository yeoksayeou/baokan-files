    Once you enter the coastal areas of the Fujian front lines, facing Jinmen and Mazu across the sea, you are immediately reminded of the old revolutionary base areas during the Anti-Japanese War and the Liberation War. Here, large-character slogans are everywhere on the walls: "Consolidate Coastal Defense," "Support the Frontline," "The Army Loves the People, the People Support the Army, We Are One Family." On Sundays, young soldiers can be seen sitting on small stools in the sun chatting with old mothers, helping the cooperatives sun fishnets and carry oysters, and some soldiers are jumping rope and playing ring toss with children wearing red scarves, causing the old men and young women watching the fun to burst into laughter.
    I followed Sergeant Yan Zhensong, the squad leader, to his squad. As soon as we entered, an old mother greeted me and brought me a bowl of boiled water. The soldiers praised the old mother to me, saying: when they were sick, the old mother busied herself beating eggs and cooking porridge, constantly asking about their well-being; when it was cold, the old mother got up early to boil water for them to wash their faces; when their clothes were placed under the bed, the old mother always secretly took them away to wash... Hearing this, the old woman was embarrassed and quickly interrupted, saying, "Why don't you talk about how you help me fetch water, sweep the floor, and help me with my work?" At this time, a seven or eight-year-old girl ran in, bumped into a soldier, and pouted, saying, "Uncle, A Tu snatched my little boat, go get it back for me." The soldier tore a piece of paper from his notebook and folded another small boat for her. She happily clamored for a bigger one.
    As I was deeply attracted by this atmosphere of familial intimacy, Squad Leader Yan told me that their former landlord, the old mother, still often runs seven or eight miles to see them, and the old landlord often carries vegetables and sweet potatoes to send to them. Once, while performing a task at night, they stayed in an old man's house. Every morning, the old mother always woke them up, holding snow-white rice and saying, "Eat, you are too tired at night."
    Next door to this house is the "Army-Civilian Propaganda Group Against the Enemy." More than twenty young women are stuffing propaganda materials with the words "Welcome to Abandon Darkness and Seek the Light" into bamboo tubes, and some are making five-foot-tall kites. They work very skillfully. An officer here told me that they are all members of the agricultural production cooperative. They can earn many work points by working in the cooperative for a day; but in order to support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Jinmen, Mazu and Taiwan, they always compete to come and do this work. Sometimes, because too many people come, they are persuaded to go back, and they are even criticized for it. Not far from this house is the army clinic. There are also a dozen or so residents sitting here, some to treat small sores on their legs, and some to see a doctor for their children. They vied to tell me that the "doctor" is very good, he treats them whenever they come; if they have an emergency, they call him in the middle of the night, and he follows them wearing his clothes. Last October, a child was injured by the enemy's shells. He carried his medicine bag to see the child almost every day, and in less than a month he healed the child's injury. I asked this health worker named Chen Yiliang how many people he had treated last year. He calculated for a long time and said: "Probably more than a thousand person-times."
    The evenings are also very lively here, with the army's singing and the laughter of the militia and young women. The night school is always crowded, with old men, old women, and daughters-in-law holding children. The lecturers on the podium are soldiers from the army. In the militia headquarters, the militiamen are listening to the soldiers explain weapons knowledge and shooting techniques. The communication soldier who brought me told me that as soon as the film crew arrives, they notify the residents and reserve half the seats for the residents. After they sit down, the "cheerleaders" start shouting, singing on this side and performing operas on that side. When I arrived at the company headquarters, the company commander and instructor were chatting and laughing with a group of militiamen. At seven o'clock sharp, the militiamen took the "password" from the company commander and went out, and the company commander also went to check the sentry posts. Instructor Zhang Shifu, a lieutenant, pointed to the Fujian Province map on the wall and said to me: "It is impossible to have soldiers everywhere along this winding 20,000-mile coastline, like deploying a 'long snake formation.' But our coastal defense line is like a copper wall and iron wall. If the enemy comes, we can annihilate it. This is mainly due to the powerful cooperation between the army and the people.” He told many stories:
    Last October, three special agents from the Second Group of the Kuomintang "Central Committee" landed on a remote seaside in Lianjiang County, Mazu Islands. While the coastal defense troops were surrounding and arresting them, the militia arrived. They led the troops, divided into four routes to encircle and suppress the agents. In less than four hours, all of these agents were captured. Another time, four agents had just landed when the militiamen discovered them. They reported to the troops and went into the mountains to encircle and suppress them. When the troops caught two agents and joined the militia, the militia had already caught two. The militia here are indeed a powerful helper to the troops: when the army's reconnaissance personnel want to go deep into the enemy-occupied islands for reconnaissance activities, the militia row boats to send the troops to the enemy-occupied islands. To carry out propaganda against the enemy, the militiamen sent millions of copies of propaganda materials to the enemy-occupied islands. The militiamen on Dadeng Island also learned the skills of using artillery from the artillery troops. They said that if they encounter fierce artillery battles and the gunners are killed or injured, they will take over the gunners and continue fighting.
    Here, the names of the agricultural and fishery production cooperatives are also meaningful. Some are called "Frontline," some are called "Support the Frontline," and some are called "Army-Civilian Unity" Cooperative. On Xiamen Island, I visited Huang Ketan, the deputy director of the Qunxing Agricultural Production Cooperative. He told me that their cooperative has 613 households, and 94.9% of the members increased their income last year, some by more than double. In the past, many households relied on government relief, but now every family has two meals of dry rice and one meal of porridge every day.
    Here, it is less than 10,000 meters away from the enemy. Sitting in the house and looking out the window, across the strait like a blue ribbon are a string of enemy-occupied islands such as Jinmen, Shuyu, Huzaiyu, Dadan, and Erdan. On a clear day, you can also see the villages and trees on the islands. Huang Ketan pointed to the window from time to time and said excitedly: "Without the troops, we would not be able to produce or live and work in peace." Last year, they suffered dozens of enemy artillery attacks, destroying more than 40 houses and killing 17 head of cattle, but no one was injured. He told me that most of the anti-artillery holes behind each house and in the fields were dug with the help of the troops, and the troops also taught them how to accurately grasp the enemy's artillery fire patterns. Every time the enemy shelled, the troops rang the bell on the mountain, and the members heard the bell and went into the anti-artillery holes to hide. When the shelling stopped, the troops rang the bell again, and they came out to work again. When they went to sea to fish, they also told the troops, and the troops often supported them with artillery fire. During the most tense days of the enemy's shelling, the troops also helped the village cadres organize the masses to evacuate. After the evacuation, the troops and militia were responsible for guarding the property of the masses.
    He also told me that last year the troops helped his cooperative build a reservoir, two dams, and three canals, gave them a double-wheeled double-shared plow, a threshing machine, more than 5,000 dan of horse manure and human fertilizer, helped them harvest more than 100 mu of rice, and ran five night schools for them. They supplied the troops with vegetables and other non-staple foods, and helped the troops carry out propaganda work against the enemy. He said: "These cannot explain the friendship between us. We have developed a habit that whoever has difficulties, everyone takes the initiative to help solve them."
    In the rural areas of the front lines, I also saw children often holding bunches of flowers and putting them on the artillery positions and in the soldiers' dormitories. One child answered me like this: "We should help these uncles with their work and give them flowers." These people who have formed a deep friendship in years of combat life are helping each other, supporting each other, and living together lovingly.

    前线农村军民一家	新华社记者　成一
    一进入福建前线和金门、马祖遥遥相对的沿海地区，立即使人联想起抗日战争和解放战争时期老根据地农村的景色。这里，墙上到处是大字标语：“巩固海防”，“支援前线”，“军爱民，民拥军，我们是一家人”。星期天，年轻的战士有的在太阳地里坐着小板凳同老妈妈聊天，有的帮着合作社晒鱼网、抬海蛎子，还有些战士和戴红领巾的孩子一起跳绳、套圈，惹得围着看热闹的老头和青年妇女哈哈大笑。
    我随班长颜振松中士到了他的班里。一进门，一位老妈妈就向我打招呼，给我端来一碗开水。战士们向我夸奖老妈妈说：他们生了病，老妈妈忙着打鸡蛋、煮稀饭，不断来问寒问暖；天冷了，老妈妈起早为他们烧洗脸水；他们的衣服放在床底下，老妈妈总是偷偷拿去洗……。这位老人听得不好意思，急忙抢着说：“你们怎么不说说你们怎样给我打水、扫地、帮我干活呢？”这时候，一个七八岁的小女孩跑进来，压到一个战士身上咕嘟着嘴说：“叔叔，我的小船叫阿土抢去了，你去给我要回来。”这个战士从笔记本上撕一张纸又给她折起小船来，她高兴地嚷着要个大的。
    当我被这种亲如家人的气息深深吸引住的时候，颜班长告诉我，他们过去的房东老妈妈，至今还常跑七、八里路来看他们，房东老大爷常背着蔬菜、红薯来送给他们吃。有一次，夜间执行任务，他们住在一位老人家里。每天早晨，老妈妈总是把他们叫醒，端着雪白的米饭说：“吃吧，你们晚上太累了。”
    这座房子隔壁，是“军民对敌宣传组”。二十多个青年妇女有的把写着“欢迎弃暗投明”的宣传品装进竹筒，有的在扎五尺多高的大风筝，她们工作非常熟练。这里的一位军官对我说，她们都是农业生产合作社的社员，在合作社干一天可以挣很多工分；可是为了支援解放军解放金门、马祖和台湾，她们总是争着来干，有时因为人来得太多劝她们回去，还受到她们的责难。离这座房子不远，是部队的门诊所，这里也坐着十来个居民，有的来治腿上的小疮，有的给小孩看病。他们争着告诉我：“医生”真好，什么时候来，他什么时候给治；有了急病，半夜叫他，他披着衣服就跟着走。去年10月，有一个孩子叫敌人的炮弹打伤了，他几乎天天背着药包来看孩子，不到一个月他就把孩子的伤治好了。我问这个叫陈依良的卫生员去年治了多少人，他计算了很久说：“大概一千多人次。”
    晚上，这里也很热闹，有部队的歌声，也有民兵和青年妇女的笑声。夜校里总是挤满了人，有老头、老太太，也有抱小孩的媳妇，在讲台上讲课的是部队的战士。民兵队部里，民兵们在听战士讲解兵器常识和射击要领。带我的通讯员告诉我，电影队一来他们就通知居民，给居民留一半位置，坐下以后“啦啦队”就喊起来，这边唱歌，那边唱戏。我到了连部，连长、指导员正和一批民兵在谈笑。七点整，民兵们从连长手里拿着“口令”出去了，连长也查哨去了。指导员张世福中尉指着墙上的福建省地图对我说：“这弯弯曲曲两万里长的海岸线，不可能像摆‘长蛇阵’一样到处都是兵。但是我们的海防线却像铜墙铁壁，敌人一来就能歼灭它，这主要是军民的有力配合。他讲了许多故事：
    去年10月，国民党“中委会”二组三个特务，从马祖列岛连江县一个偏僻的海边登陆。当海防部队正在围捕的时候，民兵赶来了，他们给部队带路分四路围剿，不到四个钟头，这批特务全部落网。还有一次，四个特务刚刚登陆，民兵们发觉了，他们一面报告部队，一面进山围剿，当部队抓到两个特务和民兵会合的时候，民兵也已抓了两个。这里的民兵确实是部队的有力助手：部队侦察员要在夜间深入敌占岛屿进行侦察活动，民兵们摇着船把部队送到敌占岛屿。开展对敌宣传，民兵们把上百万份的宣传品送到敌占岛屿上。大嶝岛的民兵还跟炮兵部队学会了使用大炮的本领。他们说，如果遇到激烈的炮战，炮手们伤亡了，他们就接替炮手继续作战。
    在这里，农业和渔业生产合作社的名字也意味深长，有的叫“前沿”，有的叫“支援前线”，还有的叫“军民团结”合作社。在厦门岛，我访问了群星农业生产合作社副主任黄克谈。他告诉我，他们的合作社有六百十三户，去年有94.9％的社员增加了收入，有的增加两倍多。过去许多户靠政府救济，现在家家都是每天两顿干饭，一顿稀饭。
    这里离敌人不到一万公尺，坐在屋里从窗口向外望，一条蓝带子似的海峡那边就是金门、鼠屿、虎仔屿、大担、二担等一串敌占岛屿，晴天还能看见岛上的村落和树木。黄克谈不时指着窗外激动地说：“没有部队我们没法生产，也不能安居乐业。”去年他们遭到敌人几十次炮击，被打坏四十多间房子，打死十七头耕牛，但是没有伤亡一个人。他告诉我，每家屋后和田里的防炮洞多半是部队帮助挖的，他们能够较准确的掌握敌人炮火规律也是部队教的。每次敌人炮击的时候，部队在山上敲钟，社员们听到钟声进防炮洞隐蔽，炮火一停部队又打钟，他们再出来干活。他们下海捕鱼的时候，也都告诉部队，部队常常用炮火支援他们。在敌人炮击最紧张的日子里，部队还帮助村干部组织群众转移，转移以后部队和民兵还负责看守群众的财产。
    他还告诉我，去年部队帮助他的合作社修了一座水库、两个水坝、三条水渠，送给他们一部双轮双铧犁、一部脱谷机、五千多担马粪和人肥，帮他们割了一百多亩稻子，为他们办了五所夜校。他们供给部队蔬菜等副食品，帮助部队开展对敌宣传工作。他说：“这些不能说明我们之间的友谊，我们已经养成了一种习惯，谁有困难，谁都是主动来帮助解决。”
    在前线农村，我还看到孩子们常常抱着一束束鲜花放到炮兵阵地上和战士的宿舍里。有一个孩子这样回答我：“我们帮助这些叔叔做事，给他们送花是应该的”。这些在长年的战斗生活中结成了深厚的友情的人们，就是这样互相帮助，互相支援，相亲相爱地共同生活着。
