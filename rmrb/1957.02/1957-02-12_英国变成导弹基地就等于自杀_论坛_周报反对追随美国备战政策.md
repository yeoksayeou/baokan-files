Xinhua News Agency, London, 9th (TASS dispatch): The British Labour Party's "Forum" Weekly published an editorial saying that implementing the plan to turn Britain into a U.S. "missile launching base" would be "suicide" for Britain, because Britain, with its small area and dense population, would be particularly vulnerable to retaliatory strikes.

The weekly pointed out that Defense Minister Sandys' recent negotiations in Washington were intended to make Britain more dependent on the United States, which would have dangerous consequences. The weekly wrote, "By agreeing to make Britain an integral part of the U.S. global strategic structure, Britain cannot propose suggestions for maintaining peace in Europe, nor can it show initiative in easing the Cold War, which is linked to the danger of a real war."

The weekly demanded that the Labour Party oppose the current government's policy and propose its own "brave and active policy of using negotiations to safeguard peace."

"Forum" Weekly advocates greatly reducing Britain's military budget. The weekly said: "If we hope to have an independent political influence, then our economic independence is essential."

    英国变成导弹基地就等于自杀
    “论坛”周报反对追随美国备战政策
    新华社11日讯　据塔斯社伦敦9日讯：英国工党“论坛”周报发表社论说，实行把英国变为美国“发射导弹的基地”的计划，对于英国等于是“自杀”，因为面积不大而人口稠密的英国特别容易在反击下受到伤害。
    周报指出，英国国防大臣桑迪斯不久前在华盛顿举行的谈判，是要使英国更加依赖美国，这将会引起危险的后果。周报写道，“同意使英国成为美国全球战略机构的组成部分，英国就不能提出关于维护欧洲和平的建议，就不能在缓和冷战中表现主动精神，而冷战是和产生真正战争的危险联系在一起的”。
    周报要求工党反对现政府的政策，并且提出自己的“利用谈判来保障和平的勇敢而积极的政策”。
    “论坛”周报主张大大削减英国的军事预算。周报说：“如果我们希望能有一种独立的政治影响，那么，我国的经济独立是十分必要的”。
