Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, February 16th: Cairo newspapers continued to criticize on the 15th the U.S. plan to have the United Nations Emergency Force occupy Gaza and grant Israel "free passage" in the Gulf of Aqaba.

    "Al-Ahram" said that the United States is adopting an openly hostile attitude towards Egypt. "Al-Ahram" quoted recent newspaper reports saying that the U.S. decision to guarantee free passage in the Gulf of Aqaba is motivated by the desire to build a new waterway within Israel to transport Middle Eastern oil.

    "Al-Shaab" said that the purpose of the new U.S. proposal is to control several waterways in the Middle East in addition to protecting the Baghdad Pact countries.

Xinhua News Agency, Washington, February 16th: Israeli Ambassador to the U.S. Eban met with U.S. Secretary of State Dulles on the 15th, asking Dulles to "further clarify" his plan proposed on the 11th regarding Israeli troop withdrawal.

    Eban did not disclose what requests he made to Dulles, but sources said that Eban wanted to obtain from the United States guarantees that were much stronger than those Dulles had offered on the 11th. At the same time, Israel insisted on keeping its troops in the Gaza Strip.

    U.S. State Department Press Officer White issued a statement saying that Israel's response to the U.S. on the troop withdrawal issue "did not seem to comply" with the U.S. plan, and "we are very sorry." The statement said that the U.S. and Israel are currently studying the issue, and the U.S. is awaiting further clarification of Israel's position as stated by Eban.

    埃报抨击美国敌视埃及
    以驻美大使要求杜勒斯给予更有力的支持
    据新华社开罗16日电　开罗报纸15日继续抨击美国打算让联合国紧急部队占领加沙和让以色列在亚喀巴湾“自由通航”的计划。
    “金字塔报”说，美国正在采取公开敌视埃及的态度。“金字塔报”引用最近的报纸消息说，美国决定要保证亚喀巴湾的自由通航的动机是想在以色列境内开凿一条新的水道来运输中东的石油。
    “人民报”说，美国提出新方案的目的是使自己除了保护巴格达条约国家以外还能控制中东的几条水道。
    据新华社16日讯　华盛顿消息：以色列驻美大使伊班15日会见了美国国务卿杜勒斯，要求杜勒斯“进一步澄清”他在11日提出的关于以色列撤军的计划。
    伊班没有透露他对杜勒斯提出了什么要求，但是有消息说，伊班要从美国得到比杜勒斯在11日提出的有力得多的保证，同时，以色列还坚持要把军队继续留在加沙地区。
    美国国务院新闻发布官怀特发表声明说，以色列在撤军问题上给予美国的答复“似乎没有顺从”美国的计划，“我们感到很遗憾”。声明说，目前美国和以色列双方正在研究这个问题，美国正在等待进一步澄清伊班所陈述的以色列的态度。
