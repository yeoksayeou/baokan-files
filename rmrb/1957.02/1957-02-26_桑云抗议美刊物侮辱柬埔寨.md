Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, February 25th: Cambodian Prime Minister Sihanouk issued a statement on national radio on the 24th on behalf of the government, lodging a serious protest against an article concerning Cambodia published in the American "Time" magazine on February 11th.

Sihanouk said that this article, without any restraint, exaggerates and talks nonsense at will, and arbitrarily damages and demeans what Cambodia considers most precious: the monarchy, religion, national traditions, and our noble prince.

The Prime Minister pointed out that this article is obviously unpleasant. The Cambodian people and members of society are very angry and shocked at this despicable remark, which will sow seeds of unease between the United States and Cambodia.

    桑云抗议美刊物侮辱柬埔寨
    新华社金边25日电　柬埔寨首相桑云24日在国家电台以政府名义发表谈话，他对2月11日出版的美国“时代”周刊上所登载的一篇有关柬埔寨情况的文章提出严重抗议。
    桑云说，这篇文章毫无顾忌地随便夸张和任意乱说，并且随便损害和贬低柬埔寨认为最尊贵的东西：君主政体、宗教、民族传统和我们高贵的亲王。
    首相指出，这篇文章显然是令人不愉快的。柬埔寨人民和社会人士对于这种可鄙的言论感到十分恼怒和十分骇异，这种文章会在美国和柬埔寨之间散播不安的种子。
