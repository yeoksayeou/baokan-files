According to the Fujian Daily News: Xiamen City has initially completed its work of adjusting the organizational form of handicraft production cooperatives. Based on the original production and management characteristics of each industry, the city's 72 handicraft cooperatives have successively divided 11 large cooperatives into 42 smaller cooperatives (groups). In addition, 172 people were divided into self-sufficient small groups and member households, and 15 service points were added.

This organizational adjustment, with the exception of specialized manufacturing industries with greater production collaboration, industries with relatively simple product manufacturing and less collaboration, and industries with certain relationships between supply, marketing and the masses, retains centralized production, appropriate centralization, or a variety of coexisting organizational forms. For purely repair and service industries, as well as industries mainly engaged in repair and part manufacturing, centralized production is generally not adopted. For cooperative societies with little collaboration and multiple comprehensive industries, cooperatives and groups are organized separately according to the characteristics of each natural industry, with separate accounting and each assuming its own profits and losses. For manufacturing and repair industries, due to the close relationship with consumers, blind centralized production was implemented during the high tide of socialist transformation, which has now been restored during the adjustment.

In addition, when rationally adjusting the labor organization, the brand-name households and brand-name stores of handicrafts were restored and retained to promote the original excellent characteristics. In the process of adjusting the organization, management personnel were also rationally reduced, service attitude was improved, and independent accounting with each production unit being responsible for its own profits and losses was implemented. Therefore, the members are further concerned about the cooperative, and the enthusiasm for production has been greatly enhanced. After the plate cart cooperative adjusted its organization, although the number of production personnel decreased from 36 to 12, the output value continued to rise. Before the adjustment, the average monthly output value per person was 215 yuan, and after the adjustment, the average monthly output value per person was 326 yuan.

    妥善解决集中和分散问题
    厦门市调整手工业合作组织
    据福建日报讯　厦门市手工业生产合作社调整组织形式的工作已初步完成。全市七十二个手工业社，根据各行业原有的生产经营特点，先后把十一个大社分为四十二个小社（组），还有一百七十二人分为自负盈亏的小组和社员户，并增设了十五个服务点。
    这次调整组织，除专门制造性的行业，生产协作性较大，以及产品制造较简单，协作关系不大，供销同群众有一定关系的行业，保留集中生产、适当集中或采用多种多样并存的组织形式外，对纯修理服务性以及主要修理兼制造的行业，一般不采取集中生产。对协作关系不大、多行业综合性的合作社，根据各行业特点，以自然行业分别组织合作社和小组，分别核算，各负盈亏。对制造兼修理行业，由于原来和消费者有密切关系，在社会主义改造高潮中盲目集中生产，在调整的时候加以恢复。
    此外，在合理调整劳动组织的时候，还恢复和保留手工业的名牌户、名牌店，以发扬原有的优良特点。在调整组织中，并合理减少了管理人员，改进了服务态度，实行各生产单位自负盈亏，独立核算。因此，社员进一步关心合作社，生产积极性大大发挥。板车社调整组织后，虽然生产人数由三十六人减少到十二人，但是产值不断上升，未调整的时候平均每人每月产值二百十五元，调整后每人每月产值三百二十六元。
