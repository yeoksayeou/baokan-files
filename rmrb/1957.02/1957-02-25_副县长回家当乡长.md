    Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 24th—"Deputy County Head Tian's application has been approved; he's going to be the head of Jianhu Township!" This welcome news has been spreading rapidly among cadres in Shaoxing County, Zhejiang Province, these past two days.
    Tian Yunyou, Deputy County Head of Shaoxing County and member of the Shaoxing County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, was previously the director of the Ludong Advanced Agricultural Cooperative in Jianhu Township before May of last year. Since its establishment in 1953, the cooperative has seen increased production and higher incomes for its members every year. In 1955, the average household income reached more than 350 yuan, and every family lived a life of plenty. Therefore, Tian Yunyou was known as "Harvest Director" by the local farmers. In May of last year, at the Shaoxing County People's Congress meeting, Tian Yunyou was elected as Deputy County Head of Shaoxing County. Subsequently, at the first Shaoxing County Party Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, he was elected as a member of the County Committee.
    After becoming Deputy County Head and a member of the County Committee, Tian Yunyou, with a spirit of humility and eagerness to learn, overcame many difficulties in his work caused by his low level of education. He often went down to the villages and cooperatives to discuss matters with agricultural cooperative members and cadres, helping the agricultural cooperatives solve many problems.
    This year during the Spring Festival, Tian Yunyou returned to his hometown and saw that the lives of the farmers were even happier. The Ludong Cooperative has become a large cooperative with more than 600 households (originally more than 200 households). It also overcame four disasters such as floods, typhoons, and droughts, and achieved a bumper harvest, with the average household income reaching more than 400 yuan. However, with the expansion of the agricultural cooperative, many new problems have also emerged. At this time, just as the Party called on rural cadres to go down to the villages and cooperatives to share weal and woe with the peasants and build a new socialist countryside for the long term, Tian Yunyou's thoughts were stirred. On February 12th, he requested at the County Committee meeting that he be approved to return to work in the agricultural cooperative or township. Many members of the Ludong Agricultural Cooperative also wrote letters to the County People's Committee requesting approval for Tian Yunyou to return to lead them in running the cooperative better and strive for a bumper harvest this year. After consultation, the Shaoxing County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the County People's Committee approved Tian Yunyou's request and agreed that he return to Jianhu Township to concurrently serve as the township head.
    These days, Tian Yunyou is studying rural policies with district and township cadres. He stated that after returning to the township, he will still live in the Ludong Cooperative, live with the members, learn and summarize experiences, guide the agricultural cooperatives throughout the township to do a good job in preparing for spring plowing, and strive for a bumper harvest in agricultural production this year.

    副县长回家当乡长
    新华社杭州24日电　“田副县长的申请被批准了，到鉴湖乡当乡长去！”这是近两天来浙江省绍兴县机关干部频频盛传着的喜讯。
    绍兴县副县长、中共绍兴县委员会委员田运友，去年5月以前是鉴湖乡鲁东高级农业社的社主任。这社从1953年创办以来，社里年年增产，社员也年年增加收入。1955年平均每户收入达到了三百五十多元，户户都过着丰衣足食的生活。因此，田运友被当地农民称为“丰收主任”。去年5月，绍兴县召开人民代表大会会议时，田运友当选为绍兴县副县长。接着又在中共绍兴县第一次党代表大会上，当选为县委委员。
    在担任副县长和县委委员以后，田运友以谦逊好学的精神，克服了因文化水平低而带来的工作上的许多困难。他经常下乡下社，和农业社员、社干部一起商量办事，帮助农业社解决了许多困难。
    今年春节，田运友回到家乡，看到农民的日子过得更幸福了。鲁东社已成了一个六百多户的大社（原来是两百多户）。并战胜了四次水、风、旱等灾害，获得了丰收，全社平均每户收入达到了四百多元。但是，随着农业社的扩大，社里也出现了不少新问题。这时，正逢党号召农村干部下乡下社和农民同甘共苦、长期建设社会主义新农村，田运友的思想活动起来了。2月12日，他在县委会上要求批准他回到农业社或乡里去工作。鲁东农业社也有许多社员写信向县人民委员会要求批准田运友回去领导他们把合作社办得更好，争取今年大丰收。中共绍兴县委员会和县人民委员会协商后，批准了田运友的要求，同意他回到鉴湖乡去兼任乡长。
    这几天，田运友正在和区乡干部一起学习农村政策。他表示：回乡后将仍住在鲁东社，和社员生活在一起，学习和总结经验，指导全乡的农业社做好春耕准备工作，争取今年农业生产大丰收。
