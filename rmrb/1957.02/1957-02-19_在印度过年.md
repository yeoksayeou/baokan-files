Although the Indian people, like us, value their traditional Spring Festival, which falls in April, they still arranged New Year's programs to entertain the Chinese Women's Delegation on New Year's Eve of 1956, making our visit – the Chinese Women's Delegation to India – in Bangalore very enjoyable.

On New Year's Eve morning, we were still in Mysore, visiting the sandalwood oil factory and the zoo. India is the world's leading producer of sandalwood oil. Sandalwood oil is an important raw material for making cosmetics. The sandalwood forests in India are state-owned, and even private individuals with a few trees must sell them to the government for felling. A barrel of sandalwood oil weighing twenty-five pounds sells for one thousand five hundred rupees. In the zoo, the flower-nosed elephants were very docile and could be ridden by people under the guidance of the mahout. Elephants are used as a means of transport, and their value reaches 20,000 rupees. After visiting the venomous snake research institute in Mumbai, we were no longer afraid to take another look at the King Cobra here. There are many tropical animals here. Although peacocks and monkeys also live in the zoo, they are almost like cats and dogs to the Indian people, much like they are to us.

That afternoon, we also visited the telephone factory in Bangalore. This is a new factory built during India's Five-Year Plan. Construction began in 1947, and it currently has 5,000 workers and is still expanding. The finished products are very delicate and can be exported. The products of this factory were used when the Asian-African Conference was held.

In the afternoon, there was a tea party for women from all walks of life at the hostel, and three young female workers from the telephone factory also came. Female workers in Indian textile factories account for less than one-tenth of the workforce, but in this telephone factory, female workers account for one-tenth, so there are special personnel to manage female workers' welfare. Some people in India believe that jobs like those in telephone factories are more refined, some jobs can be done sitting down, and there are no night shifts, which are more suitable for female workers. These three female workers were very surprised when we told them that Chinese female workers participate in various industrial sectors. They asked us to send their greetings to the Chinese female workers. They said that most of the female workers in their factory can still maintain their professional positions after marriage and having children.

During the tea party, I also met such upper-class women who carefully inquired about the number of female ministers and female leaders in China, because she said that India only has one female Minister of Health, one female Provincial Governor, and one female Ambassador. The proportion of female members in the upper and lower houses is also not large - the Federal Council has twenty out of two hundred and sixteen, and the People's Council has eighteen out of four hundred and ninety-nine. When I roughly told her the number of our female leaders, she was very surprised and said:

“How good the Chinese government is! We are far behind!”

I had to tell her that most Chinese women are concerned about the opportunity to work for the motherland, and they don't care so much about positions, but mainly work according to their abilities.

The head of the Bangalore reception group was an old lady, a social worker, who sometimes wrote. She gave each of us a copy of her play's scene-by-scene description as a New Year's gift - The Victory of Asoka. This play depicts the ancient Indian Emperor Asoka. The daughter of the reception group leader had just graduated from university, majoring in economics, and had no plans to find a job. She wanted to go to graduate school in another city, but her mother thought she was too young and didn't feel at ease, so she stayed by her mother's side to engage in some social activities.

On New Year's Day, the host arranged for us to wear saris and take a group photo as a souvenir. We followed suit and dressed up at dusk when the guests were leaving. The saris were borrowed. It looks very chic and convenient for Indian women to wear saris, but we couldn't do anything with this six-yard-long silk. So the mother and daughter of the reception group leader were very busy, matching and dressing us one by one. It turns out that you have to tie it around your waist first, and then drape it left and right. The sari was so long that it dragged on the ground, so we had to lift it up and take steps, laughing at each other. We also asked the host, Mrs. Menon, to try on a cheongsam and take a photo with us.

On New Year's Eve, the dining table was set up in the hall, with fresh flowers and bouquets on the white tablecloth, and complete with fruits, naturally including papayas, etc. In India, people who don't drink don't have to worry about toasting, because they abstain from alcohol and basically don't drink.

Because Hindus worship cows as gods, and Muslims also have their own customs, there are various taboos when eating with them, so they only eat chicken, fish, vegetables, etc. But if you eat authentic Indian food, you often simply eat vegetarian food, with small silver cups placed in a large silver plate, with five or six kinds of dishes and soups, as well as rice and crispy cakes, all with spices. Some religious followers do not eat after sunset.

Besides the daughter of the reception group leader, there was also Miss Daviki sitting next to me. She was also a university graduate who had been learning housework from her mother at home for the past year and a half.

“Because my father ordered it, he is a retired judge.” This gentle lady said with a smile.

The daughter of the reception group leader immediately interjected:

“She is waiting to get married and will be married to Delhi in February!”

Miss Daviki blushed slightly and then calmly added: "I don't have time to invite Chinese friends!"

Her fiancé works in the chemical industry department in Delhi and is originally a relative. They have met each other. In February, he will come to Bangalore to marry her. According to Indian customs, the man always comes to the woman's house to marry her, and then returns to the man's house after the wedding. They heard that the Chinese custom is that the woman marries into the man's family and found it very novel. New-style Indian families also live separately with young couples after marriage.

Indian wedding customs also vary from region to region and folk custom to folk custom. The daughter of the reception group leader said that Daviki will have to take a broom and enter the door of her mother-in-law's house, and everyone will pretend not to let her in. She will give everyone some money and then she can go in.

This time Miss Daviki blushed all the way to her neck and solemnly said:

“She doesn’t understand our customs. Our bride does not take a broom, but has to draw a bucket of water from the well in her husband’s house, and then she can enter the house.”

Dinner was very pleasant. Although we had to fly to Madras the next day, this was, after all, the last night of 1956. Someone suggested singing. Someone in the delegation sang two songs. The host sang a folk song, the mother and daughter of the reception group leader, and Mrs. Menon also sang a hearty song. She is the Parliamentary Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Chairman of the All India Women's Conference. She is very capable and simple, often wearing cloth clothes and simple saris. Except for a necklace that is said to be beneficial to health, she does not wear any other jewelry. This necklace may be a religious souvenir.

The song she sang was very moving, and we liked it very much. Everyone in the hall listened quietly. Afterwards, she wrote down the lyrics for me:

You are my mother,
India is my wet nurse, my homeland.
Why are you sleeping - with messy hair and tattered clothes,
When 360 million people shout in unison: My motherland!
Why are you sad, why are you tired,
Why are you in such a pitiful situation,
When 360 million people shout in unison: My motherland!

I may not have translated it well, but she did sing it very well. I remembered what I read in some book about India's poverty and unemployment that are difficult to overcome all at once. Regarding these, Indian friends do not shy away from them, just as we do not shy away from our shortcomings with them.

Her singing made my heart sink. It was not until the end of the banquet late at night, when they enthusiastically wished us a happy new year, and outside was a quiet "summer night," with the fragrance of flowers drifting over, that I remembered that this was the first time I had spent the New Year in single clothes. The warmth of nature, coupled with the warm friendship of the hosts, brought my sinking mood back up. (Attached picture)

    在印度过年
    子冈
    虽然印度人民也像我们重视传统春节一样，在4月里有他们自己的年节，但是为了招待中国妇女代表团，在1956年除夕这一天，他们还是安排了过年的节目，使我们——中国妇女访印代表团在班加罗尔过得很快乐。
    除夕上午，我们还在迈索尔市，参观了檀香油厂和动物园。印度是世界主要出产檀香油的国家。檀香油是一种制造化妆品的重要原料。印度的檀香树林统归国营，私人有少数几株的，也须出售给政府砍伐。一桶二十五磅重的檀香油，就售价一千五百卢比。在动物园里，花鼻梁大象非常驯顺，可以在驭象人的牵引下任人骑乘。大象被当作载重的工具，它的身价达两万卢比。在参观过孟买的毒蛇研究所以后，我们在这里再看一下眼镜蛇之王也就没有畏惧之感了。这里多热带动物。孔雀和猴子虽然也居住在动物园里，但是它对印度人民来说，它们已和猫狗之对于我们差不多了。
    这个下午，我们还在班加罗尔参观了电话机制造厂，这是印度五年计划中新建的一个厂，1947年开始建设的，现有五千工人，还要扩充。成品很精细，可供出口，亚非会议开会的时候，就是使用这个厂的成品。
    下午在招待所有个各界妇女茶会，电话机厂也来了三位年轻女工。印度纺织厂内的女工连十分之一都不到，但是在这个电话机厂，女工达十分之一，因此还有专人管理女工福利。印度有些人认为，电话机厂之类的工作比较精细，有些工作可以坐下来做，而且不作夜班，对女工较为合适。这三位女工听我们说起中国女工参加在各种各样产业部门中，十分惊奇，她们要我们向中国女工问好。她们说，在她们厂里的女工中，大多数在结婚及生小孩以后还能坚持自己的职业岗位。
    在茶会中，我也曾遇到这样的上层妇女，她细心地向我打听中国女部长、女领导人的人数，因为她说印度只有一位卫生部女部长、一位女省长、一位女大使。上下议院的女议员比例也不大——联邦院是二百一十六人中占二十，人民院是四百九十九人中占十八。我大致告诉了一下我们的妇女领导人员的数目时，她大为惊讶地说：
    “中国政府多么好啊！我们还差得远！”
    我不得不告诉她：大多数中国妇女关心的是为祖国工作的机会，对于职位，倒也不那么计较的，主要是按照能力去工作。
    班加罗尔招待组组长是位老太太、社会工作者，有时还写作，她送给我们每人一张她写的剧本分幕说明作为新年礼物——阿索卡的胜利。这剧本是描写印度一个古皇帝阿索卡王的。招待组长的女儿在大学刚毕业，读经济学，还没有就业的计划，想到别的城市升学读研究院去，但是母亲认为她年纪小，不放心，于是跟在母亲身边从事些社会活动。
    在过年这一天，主人安排我们穿了纱丽照合影像留念，我们从善如流，便在黄昏客散时乔装打扮起来。纱丽是借来的。看印度妇女披起纱丽十分潇洒便利，但是这六码长的绸子到了我们手中却奈何它不得。于是招待组组长母女大为忙碌，为我们一个个配色穿戴。原来着纱丽先得在腰间系好，然后再左披右挂。纱丽长得没足拖地，我们只好提着它迈步，相视大笑。我们也请主人梅农夫人试穿旗袍，与我们合影。
    到了除夕之夜，大厅里摆起食桌来，白桌布上鲜花彩束，水果齐全，自然少不了木瓜等等。在印度，不会喝酒的人用不到为干杯伤脑筋，因为他们禁酒，基本上不喝酒。
    因为印度教人奉牛为神，回教徒，也有自己的习俗，和她们在一起吃饭，各有各样的禁忌，因此只吃鸡、鱼、蔬菜等。但是若是吃道地的印度饭，就往往干脆素食，在大银盘中置小银盏，菜、汤共有五、六种，另就是米饭和脆饼，一律加香料。有的教徒在太阳落山以后便不进食。
    和我邻坐的除了招待组长的女儿外，还有一位台维琪小姐，她也是一位大学毕业生，一年半来离开学校以后就在家向母亲学家事。
      “因为我父亲命令如此，他是个退休法官”。这位温雅的小姐笑着说。
    招待组长的女儿马上插进来道：
    “她在等待结婚了，2月里要嫁到德里去呢！”
    台维琪小姐脸上稍稍红了一下，也就泰然地补充：“来不及请中国朋友们了啊！”
    她的未婚夫在德里化学工业部门工作，本就是亲戚，彼此见过面。2月间他将来班加罗尔迎娶。印度风俗全是男的到女家迎娶，婚后再回男家。他们听说中国风俗是女的嫁到男家，觉得很新鲜。印度新式家庭也在婚后由小夫妇另住。
    印度的婚俗又按地区与民俗而各异。招待组长的女儿说，台维琪将来要拿把扫帚走进婆婆家的门，大家假作不许她进，她塞给大家一些钱，就可以走进去了。
    这一次台维琪小姐可红脸红到了脖子，郑重地说：
    “她不了解我们的风俗，我们的新娘子不拿扫帚，但是要从丈夫家的井里打起一桶水，就可以走进家屋。”
    晚饭吃得很愉快，虽然第二天又得飞往马德拉斯，但是，这究竟是1956年的最后一个晚上啊。有人提议唱歌，代表团中有人唱了两支，主人方面由招待组长母女唱了一支民歌，梅农夫人也豪爽地唱了一支，她是外交部驻议会秘书，同时是全印妇女会议主席。人很干练，也很朴实，时常穿布衣和简单纱丽，除了一根据说是有益于健康的项链，没有佩其他饰物。这项链可能是个宗教性的纪念物。
    她唱的歌十分动人，我们很喜欢，全厅的人听了也肃静下来。之后她为我写下了歌词：
    你是我的母亲，
    印度是我的乳母，我的故土。
    你为什么睡着——乱发蓬蓬，衣衫褴褛，
    当三亿六千万人民同声呼喊：我的祖国！
    你为什么忧伤，你为什么困倦，
    你为什么处境如此可怜，
    当三亿六千万人民同声呼喊：我的祖国！
    可能我没有译好，可是她确实唱得很好，我想起什么书上说起的印度的难以一下子克服的贫困与失业来了。关于这些，印度朋友们并不讳言，正好像我们对他们也不讳言我们的缺点似的。
    她唱得使我的心也沉下去了似的。一直到深夜席散，她们一个个热烈祝贺我们新年快乐，外面是静悄悄的“夏夜”，什么花香飘送过来，我才想起来这是头一遭穿了单衣过年呢。自然界的温暖加上主人的热诚友谊，使我下沉的心情又浮了上来。（附图片）
