The Contribution of Tin
Gao Shiqi

Recently, I took a trip to the mining area in southern Yunnan, a kingdom of non-ferrous metals and the birthplace of tin. I visited the entire tin production process, from mining and ore dressing to smelting, and I felt extremely excited.

Therefore, I would like to talk about tin and its contributions.

Tin's ancestors migrated from the Earth's crust to the surface of granite. Although not all granite contains tin.

Tin is a heavy metal, so why does it float on the upper layer of granite? This is an interesting question.

It turns out that granite is a "hotel" for tin. There, tin "married" chlorine and fluorine. This newlywed compound existed in a gaseous state, so they could open a path and rush upwards, all the way to the upper layer of granite, and even beyond the granite, drilling into the crevices of other rocks.

Since arriving at the upper layer of granite, due to changes in environmental conditions, tin "divorced" chlorine and fluorine and fell in love with the oxygen in water vapor. This new combination produced a solid mineral called cassiterite. Although this is not the only cause of tin ore. Sometimes, tin also cohabitated with sulfur. Needless to say, many minerals also contain tin, but their content is scarce and has no industrial value.

Cassiterite is mostly black and brownish-yellow because it contains impurities such as iron and manganese. And because it is very hard and stable, it will not be destroyed even after changes in wind and frost and the scouring of rain.

Humans discovered cassiterite a long time ago. The great Greek poet Homer mentioned its name in his famous epic.

Today, the largest base of cassiterite is in the Malay Peninsula, where its output accounts for almost half of the world's total. In addition to the Malay Peninsula, Bolivia in South America also has abundant reserves of cassiterite. The mining area in southern Yunnan, China, is also the most famous producing area of cassiterite.

However, cassiterite is not yet tin. From cassiterite to metallic tin, three major hurdles must be overcome: the first hurdle is mining, where miners put in a lot of hard work to transport cassiterite from the mine; the second hurdle is ore dressing, where various methods are used to remove the impurities it contains; the third hurdle is smelting, where it is burned together with carbon, the oxygen in the cassiterite combines with the carbon to form carbon dioxide and runs away, leaving metallic tin.

Metallic tin is very soft, emits a silver-white luster, and has ductility. It can be stretched into very thin sheets, which are its characteristics. Its melting point is 231 degrees Celsius.

Metallic tin is very sensitive to cold. It will "get sick" when exposed to cold. Its symptoms are gradually changing from silver-white to gray, and the volume gradually expands, making it easy to crush. This disease is also contagious, with sick tin infecting healthy tin. Fortunately, this disease is curable. Remelt the sick tin once and let it cool slowly, and it will recover.

In ancient times, many centuries before the invention of ironware, people already knew how to refine tin. However, pure tin is too soft and not strong enough, making it unsuitable for manufacturing products.

What to do?

The invention of bronze solved this problem. Bronze is an alloy of copper and tin, and it is very hard. There was a time when working people's tools and weapons, daily necessities, and decorations were all made of bronze. Bronze is truly a remarkable alloy. This era is called the Bronze Age. Now the Bronze Age has long passed, but people have not forgotten the merits of bronze, and it is still used to manufacture various works of art. In some places, it is also used to mint coins, bells, and cannons.

In addition to copper, tin also has many close "friends," and mixing with them can turn into various useful alloys.

Alloys are very useful. For example, tin-lead alloys are used in many large and precise instruments and machine tools to reduce wear. Tin-lead-antimony alloys are very useful in soldering metals. The "type metal alloy" used in printing factories is also an alloy of tin!

Tin also has many "relatives," which are various tin compounds. They make many contributions in the chemical industry, the rubber industry, the printed fabric industry, and the dyeing of wool and silk.

Tin is also the main material in the manufacture of enamel, glazes, colored glass, gold leaf, and silver leaf. As for its value in the military industry, that goes without saying.

Finally, we talk about tinplate. What is tinplate? It is iron sheet coated with a thin layer of tin. Iron sheet coated with tin will not rust and is harmless to human health. Therefore, it is very safe to use tinplate to manufacture cans. With the development of the canning industry, the need for tinplate has also greatly increased. However, when people mention canned goods, they only talk about the function of iron, and the contribution of tin is forgotten. Tin is truly an unsung hero.

### 锡的贡献

    锡的贡献
    高士其
    最近我到云南南部矿区去了一趟，这个地方是有色金属的王国，是锡的诞生地。我参观了锡的全部生产过程；从采矿、选矿到冶炼，我感到极大的兴奋。
    因此，我想来谈谈锡和锡的贡献。
    锡的祖先是从地壳移居到花岗岩上面来的。虽然不是所有的花岗岩都含有锡。
    锡是一种重金属，为什么会浮在花岗岩的上层呢？这是一个有趣的问题。
    原来花岗岩是锡的“旅馆”，在那里，锡跟氯和氟“结婚”了，这对新婚的化合物，是以气体的状态出现，所以他们能打开一条活路，一直向上冲，冲到花岗岩的上层，甚至冲到花岗岩以外，钻进别种岩石的隙缝里去。
    自从到了花岗岩的上层以后，由于环境条件的改变，锡就跟氯和氟“离婚”了，而爱上了水蒸汽里的氧，这样新的结合，就产生了一种固体矿物，叫做锡石。虽然这并不是锡矿唯一的成因。有的时候，锡也曾和硫在一起同居过，不用说，好多种矿物也含有锡，但是它们的含量稀少，没有工业上的价值。
    锡石大多数都是黑色和黄褐色的，这是因为它们含有铁和锰等杂质。又因为它很坚硬、很稳定，所以虽然经过风霜的变化，雨水的冲打，而不会被破坏。
    人类在很久以前，就发现了锡石。古希腊的大诗人荷马，在他的著名史诗里面，就曾提到它的名字。
    在今天，锡石的最大根据地是在马来半岛，在那儿，它的产量差不多占全世界的半数。除了马来半岛以外，南美洲玻利维亚的锡石储藏量也非常丰富。在我国云南南部的矿区，也是锡石最有名的产地。
    但是，锡石还不是锡。从锡石到金属锡，还要走过三道大关：第一关是采矿，这里矿工们付出很艰辛的劳动，才把锡石从矿坑里运了出来；第二关是选矿，这里要用各种方法去掉它所含的杂质；第三关是冶炼，这里要把它和炭放在一起燃烧，锡石里的氧跟碳化合，变成二氧化碳跑掉了，剩下的就是金属锡。
    金属锡身体很柔软，发出银白色的光辉，有延展性，可以展成极薄的薄片，这些都是它的特点。它的熔点是摄氏二百三十一度。
    金属锡对于寒冷的感觉非常敏锐，一受到寒冷就会“生病”，它的病状是由银白色逐渐变成灰色，体积逐渐膨胀，很容易粉碎。这种病还会传染，有病的锡传染给没病的锡。幸亏这种病是可以治疗的，把有病的锡再熔化一次，让它慢慢地冷却，就会复原。
    在远古的时代，在铁器没有发明以前的许多世纪，人们早就知道怎样炼锡了。但是，纯净的锡过于柔软，而又不结实，不适合于制造用品。
    怎样办呢？
    青铜器的发明解决了这个问题。青铜是铜和锡的合金，它的硬度很大。从前有一时期，劳动人民的工具和武器，生活用品和装饰品，都是用青铜来制成的。青铜真是一种了不起的合金啊。这个时代，叫做青铜器时代。现在青铜器时代早已过去了，人们并没有忘记青铜的功绩，还用它来制造各种艺术品，有的地方也用它来铸造硬币、钟和大炮。
    除了铜以外，锡还有许多亲密的“朋友”，和它们混合在一起，可以变成种种有用的合金。
    合金的用处很大。例如锡跟铅的合金，在许多巨大的、精密的仪器和机床里，都用得着它以减少磨损。锡跟铅和锑的合金，在焊接金属的时候，是很有用的。在印刷工厂里，所用的“活字合金”，也是锡的合金呀！
    锡还有许多“亲戚”，那就是各种各样锡的化合物，在化学工业上，在橡胶工业上，在印花布工业上，在毛和丝的染色上，它们都有很多的贡献。
    在制造搪瓷、釉药、有色玻璃、金箔和银箔，锡也是主要材料。至于在军事工业上的价值，那更不用说了。
    最后，我们谈到马口铁片，马口铁片是什么东西呢？它是涂上了薄层锡的铁片。涂了锡的铁片既不会生锈，对人类的健康也没有害处。所以用马口铁片来制造罐头筒，就十分安全了。随着罐头工业的发展，马口铁片的需要也大量增加了。然而一提起罐头，人们只谈论着铁的功用，锡的贡献是被遗忘了。锡真是一种无名的英雄啊。
