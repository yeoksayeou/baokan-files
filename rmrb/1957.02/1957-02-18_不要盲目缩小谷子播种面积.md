    Do Not Blindly Reduce Millet Sowing Area
    Hu Xingzong
    Millet (粟), the fruit of which (small millet) is a staple food for the vast number of people in the north, and its stems (dry grass) are a good fodder. However, in recent years, many areas have overemphasized planting corn, without considering the needs and experience of local farmers, labor, fertilizer, and crop rotation, resulting in millet being squeezed out. As a result, the staple food rations in some areas of the north do not match the original habits, the feed has been greatly reduced, and even the corn production has been reduced due to the lack of technology. Just in terms of millet straw: In Hebei Province, the millet cultivation area has been reduced by one-third in recent years, resulting in a shortage of coarse feed for more than 600,000 livestock. Other provinces in the north have similar situations. Millet straw sells for six or seven cents a catty, two or three times more expensive than before; in some places, millet straw is even more expensive than millet, and agricultural cooperatives actually sell millet straw with ears as grass. The shortage and high price of grass make it difficult for agricultural cooperatives to raise and afford livestock, causing great difficulties for agricultural production.
    Some people believe that the yield per unit area of millet is low, the yield is unstable, it is not resistant to disasters, and it is not as good as corn, so it should be squeezed out. However, millet is not necessarily a low-yielding crop. According to the statistics compiled by the Grain Production Bureau of the Ministry of Agriculture on rich harvest experiences, the yield of millet in some agricultural cooperatives is as high as 1,000 catties or more. According to the recent four-year statistics of the Youyi Agricultural Cooperative in Ziyang, Shandong, the millet yield has remained above 1,000 catties, indicating that its yield is still stable.
    In addition, from the perspective of utilization value: farmers think millet is more delicious than corn; according to chemical composition analysis, the two are very similar. However, millet straw is a very good coarse feed for livestock, and the value of feed produced per mu is much greater than the value of feed produced by corn.
    It is hoped that when arranging this year's production plan, all localities will carefully and comprehensively consider and calculate, and no longer blindly reduce the cultivated area of millet.

    不要盲目缩小谷子播种面积
    胡兴宗
    谷子（粟）的果实（小米）是北方广大人民喜食的主粮，它的茎（干草）是一种很好的饲料。但是，近年来，很多地区过分强调多种玉米，没有从当地农民的需要和经验、人力、肥料、茬口来考虑，以致谷子受到了排挤。结果，北方一些地区主食口粮不合原有习惯，饲料大大减少，甚至因种植玉米的技术跟不上而减产。单就谷草来说：河北省近年来谷子栽培面积减少了三分之一，少产六十多万头牲畜的粗饲料。北方其他各省都有类似情况。谷草卖到六、七分钱一斤，比以前贵了两、三倍；甚至有些地方的谷草比谷子还贵，农业社竟把带着谷穗的谷草当作草卖了。草少草贵，农业社牲畜养不好、养不起，给农业生产造成很大困难。
    有些人认为谷子单位面积产量低，产量又不稳定，不耐灾害，比不上玉米，所以应当挤掉它。但是，谷子并不一定是低产作物。根据农业部粮食生产总局丰产经验汇编的统计，有些农业社谷子的产量也高达千斤以上。另据山东滋阳友谊农业社最近四年的统计，谷子产量一直保持在千斤以上，可见它的产量还是稳定的。
    此外，从两者利用价值来看：农民认为谷子比玉米好吃；根据化学成分分析，两者相差很少。但谷草是牲畜很好的粗饲料，每亩所产能作饲料的价值比玉米所产的饲料的价值要大得多。
    希望各地在安排今年生产计划的时候，认真地仔细地全面地加以考虑和计算，不要再盲目地缩小谷子的栽培面积。
