Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Frontline, 7th. The leading organs of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Fujian Frontline, at a recent political work conference, studied and arranged various tasks for supporting agricultural cooperativization and agricultural production this year.

    The meeting proposed that units at the company level and above should establish fixed ties with agricultural production cooperatives near their驻地 (zhùdì - location of stationed troops), sign support contracts, and conduct regular get-togethers and visits. During the busy farming season and when agricultural cooperatives are undertaking large-scale basic construction projects, the troops are required to actively participate in voluntary labor, with the labor days to be handled independently by the members' congress of the agricultural cooperative. In the elimination of the "Four Pests," the troops should take consistent steps with the local masses and conduct it regularly, striving to achieve even better results than the masses. Where possible, the troops should continue to help agricultural production cooperatives run night schools, clubs, and libraries, and screen films for the members.

    The meeting pointed out that while assisting agricultural cooperatives, the troops should also engage in propaganda work, encouraging the labor enthusiasm of the members and inspiring them to run the cooperatives diligently and thriftily. In addition, officers and soldiers whose families are in the countryside should frequently encourage their family members and relatives to love the cooperative as they love their home and to actively engage in production. At the meeting, a number of regulations were also made regarding the troops practicing thrift, developing sideline production, and officers saving money to support their families.

    解放军福建前线领导机关
    要求各部队经常支援农业合作社
    新华社福建前线7日电　中国人民解放军福建前线领导机关在最近召开的政治工作会议上，研究布置了今年支援农业合作化和农业生产的各项工作。
    会上提出，连以上单位要同驻地附近的农业生产合作社建立固定联系，订立支援合同，经常进行联欢、访问等活动。在农忙季节和农业社兴修规模较大的基本建设工程的时候，要求各部队积极参加义务劳动，劳动日归农业社的社员大会自行处理。在除四害中，各部队要同当地群众采取一致的步骤经常进行，并努力作出比群众更好的成绩。在可能情况下，各部队要继续帮助农业生产合作社办夜校、俱乐部和图书馆，为社员放映电影。
    会上指出，各部队在帮助农业社的同时，还要结合进行宣传工作，鼓舞社员的劳动热情，启发他们勤俭办社。另外，家在农村的官兵要经常勉励家属和亲友爱社如家，积极生产。会上，对部队厉行节约，开展副业生产，军官节省用钱赡养家属等也作了多项规定。
