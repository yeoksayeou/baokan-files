　　In Shapingzi Township, Gaiping, there was a Li Shucai, whom everyone called Lao Cai (Old Wealth). He wasn't actually wealthy; it was just because he was amusing, so everyone called him that as a play on words. He had no children, only an old wife. The two of them lived in two rooms. The inner room where he lived was kept quite clean, so the villagers often liked to chat idly in his room after a full meal when they had nothing to do. Therefore, his room became the village's club. But there was a special reason for it being a club: he had a copy of "The Case of Peng Gong" that he had been reading for over twenty years.

　　This was a Western-style book, already very old, with the beginning and end missing. But this book was the best entertainment for the farmers every night. Every evening, when the small oil lamp was lit, the old men of the village would sit around the book. Then, an old man who was somewhat literate would open the book in the lamplight. He would put on his reading glasses and then read aloud in a disjointed manner: "Ma ya... Yu Long ah..."

　　Sometimes people got tired of listening and would ask him, "Can't you change to another book?"

　　"There are no other books! Besides, I wouldn't recognize these characters in another book."

　　Anyway, the listeners were already familiar with the story, so even if he didn't read well, they could still manage. Sometimes people got tired of listening and would lean back and take a nap. It wasn't until the stars were high in the sky that people slowly dispersed.

　　This way of life had continued for a long time since the land reform, day after day, month after month.

　　I have also sat in "Lao Cai's" home. Of course, I didn't go there to listen to "The Case of Peng Gong," but out of deep sympathy for these farmers who needed cultural activities.

　　In the cultural departments, there have been many debates about rural cultural work over the years. One moment they say, "We must vigorously develop cultural centers and stations," and the next moment they say, "The development of cultural centers and stations is too hasty." Sometimes, in a burst of enthusiasm, they set up several village theater troupes, and sometimes they establish libraries. But few people study the real interests of the farmers. As for what the elderly need, what the youth need, what women need, and what children need, even fewer people consider. We often see this kind of situation: a book donation campaign is launched, so many people clean out their unused books, and Xinhua Bookstore also "donates" a large number of slow-selling books. These books are indeed sent to the rural clubs, but they are often "Twelve Books Every Cadre Must Read," outdated CPPCC documents and various reference materials, poorly translated foreign novels that have already been retranslated, and various pamphlets to go along with campaigns, even experiences in factory management that are completely irrelevant to the countryside are sent down. No wonder the farmers quickly used these books to paper their windows, and no wonder the elderly could only read that poor copy of "The Case of Peng Gong" year after year. But what is infuriating is that these book donation campaigns must have a summary, and the summary inevitably includes a statistic on the number of books donated, and even completing the book donation task and doing a good job constitutes one of the conditions for being a model worker.

　　What is frightening is that this kind of work pattern is cyclical, like a machine. This year is like this, and next year will be the same. For these old farmers, it is also a kind of mechanical cycle, constantly turning the pages of that copy of "The Case of Peng Gong." What is even more frightening is that no one says, "This is wrong," and no one seriously examines these mistakes.

　　I also tried to help these old men, so I went to a nearby bookstore.

　　"Do you have Romance of the Three Kingdoms?"

　　"No!"

　　"Do you have Water Margin?"

　　"No!"

　　I looked carefully at the bookshelves and couldn't even find Zhao Shuli's newly written book for the farmers, "Sanliwan." What I did find were various versions of pamphlets on how to run a primary cooperative (even though advanced cooperatives had already been universally established here). Looking at this phenomenon, I couldn't help but think: "Behind these books, there are probably also some activists who were selected because they had achievements in cooperating with political tasks."

　　There is no intention here to belittle the meaning of cooperating with political tasks. The problem is that few people seriously examine the real effect of this cooperation. On this issue, especially the Xinhua Bookstore's style is even more vulgar, more formalistic, and more fond of fabricating achievements.

　　As I listened to "The Case of Peng Gong," I thought: In the old society, there were book peddlers who went to the countryside, and every season they would peddle almanacs, songbooks, and other books that farmers liked. In the old liberated areas, we also organized cultural book carriers to go to the countryside. Why has this conscientious style of serving farmers' cultural needs diminished today, while formalism has grown? I think: Some leaders of our cultural departments should personally go to the homes of farmers like Li Shucai, listen to a passage from "The Case of Peng Gong," and study it carefully.

　　Otherwise, Peng Gong will protest: "Why am I always left to serve farmers' culture alone? Why not look for Shi Gong? And Liu Bei, Guan Yunchang, Li Kui, and Song Jiang!"

　　If this continues, the youth, women, and children will also protest!

    彭公的抗议
    海默
    在盖平沙岗子乡，有个李淑才，大家都叫他老财，其实他并不富裕，只是因为他好逗乐子，大家就以名谐音这样称呼他。他身后无人，只有个老伴，两个人住着两间房。他住的里屋收拾得还干净，所以乡里人饱饭后无事总好到他屋子里闲唠。因此，他的屋子就成了这个村的俱乐部。但是成为俱乐部还有个特殊原因，就是他有一本看了二十多年的“彭公案”。
    这是本洋装的书，已经十分破旧了，缺头烂尾。可是就是这本书，每天晚上成了农民们最好的消遣品。每到傍晚，小油灯一点，庄里的老人们就围坐在这本书旁边。这时，有个较通文墨的老大爷就把书对着灯亮翻开，他先戴上花镜，然后不成章句地读了起来：“马呀……玉龙啊……”
    有时人们听腻了，就问他：“你不会换一本吗？”
    “别的书也没有啊！再说这上头的字换在别的书上，我就不认得了。”
    反正听书的人对这个故事已熟记在心了，他念得再不好，还是能够将就。有时人们听累了，就往后一靠，睡个小觉。直等到三星很高了，人们才慢慢地相继散去。
    这个生活从土地改革后到现在已经沿袭了很久了，天天如此，月月如此。
    我也在“老财”家里坐过。当然我不是为了去听彭公案，而是由于深深同情这些需要文化生活的农民们。
    几年来在文化部门里关于农村文化工作的争论已经不算少了。一会儿说：“要大力发展文化馆、站”，一会儿又说：“文化馆、站发展得冒进了”。有时一阵热情上来办它几个村剧团，有时又搞个图书馆。可是对于农民们真正的爱好却很少有人去研究。至于老年人需要什么，青年需要什么，妇女需要什么，儿童需要什么？就更少有人考虑了。我们常常看见这类情形：开展一个赠书运动，于是很多人把不用的书清理了出来，新华书店也把大批滞销书“捐献”出来。这些书也真地发到农村的俱乐部里了，但这些书往往是“干部必读十二种”，是过时已久的政协文件和各种参考资料，是些翻译得很坏已经早出了重译本的外国小说，以及一些各种配合运动的小册子，甚至把根本与农村无关的工厂管理的经验也发下来了。难怪农民们很快地就用这些书糊了窗子，难怪老年人们只好长年累月地去读那本可怜的彭公案了。可是令人可气的是这些赠书运动还要有个总结，在总结上不免统计上一个赠书的数目，甚至还会因为完成赠书任务工作作得不错，而构成模范条件之一。
    可怕的是这种工作规律是像机器一样循环着。今年如此，明年还如此。落在这些农民老大爷们的头上，同样是一种机械的循环，不断地翻着那本彭公案。更可怕的是没有人来说：“这是错误的”，也没有人认真来检查这些错误。
    我也曾试图来帮助一下这些老大爷们，于是我到附近的书店中去了。
    “有三国演义吗？”
    “没有！”
    “有水浒传吗？”
    “没有！”
    我仔细看了看书架子上，连一本赵树理新近为农民们写的好书“三里湾”也没有。有的则是一些各种版本的怎样办初级社的小册子（虽然这里已经普遍地成立高级社了）。我看着这种现象，心里不禁在想：“就在这些书的背后，恐怕也有些由于配合政治任务有成绩而选出的积极分子吧。”
    在这里丝毫没有轻视配合政治任务的意思，问题在于很少有人去认真检查这种配合的真正效果。在这个问题上，特别是新华书店的作风是更庸俗的，更形式主义的，更喜欢伪造成绩的。
    我听着彭公案，一面在想：旧社会，有过下乡的书贩子，他们每到一定季节会把皇历、唱本等农民喜欢的书贩来；在老解放区时代，我们也曾组织了文化书担下乡。为什么今天这种认真为农民文化服务的作风减少了，形式主义的作风却滋长了呢？我想：我们有些文化部门的领导人应该亲自到像李淑才这样农民家里，听上一段彭公案，认真地研究一下。
    否则，彭公将要提出抗议了：“为什么总是让我独自为农民文化服务呢？为什么不找一下施公去呢？还有刘备、关云长、李逵和宋江！”
    再长此下去，青年、妇女、儿童也要抗议的！
