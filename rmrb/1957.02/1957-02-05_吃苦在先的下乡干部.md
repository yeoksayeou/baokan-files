    Downward-bound Cadre Who Takes Hardship First
            Zhang Jun
    On the morning of December 13, 1956, Zhou Benshun (Communist Party member), a cadre from Wangcheng County, went to Fanshen Cooperative in Fanshen Township with a happy heart, in accordance with the organization's decision.
    As soon as he arrived at the cooperative, he discovered that there were many problems in the winter construction, especially the slow progress of embankment construction. As of December 13, only 29.3% of the plan had been completed. Of the 416 male and female full and semi-laborers in the entire cooperative, only 30 or so people were working each day. Of the 15 Party members and 78 members of the Communist Youth League, only 40 or so were participating in winter construction and production. After discovering these problems, he immediately went to discuss the winter construction work with the Party branch and the cooperative committee. On the basis of raising awareness, he assigned Party members and League members to various teams to mobilize the masses and actively carry out winter construction. At the same time, Zhou Benshun himself went to the third team, which had always had a poor work foundation. By holding meetings of old peasants and cooperative members, he explained the importance of winter construction to the masses by calculating increased production and time. The cooperative members realized the urgency of the time and actively went to work. The teams that had been working poorly also caught up.
    On December 22, 1956, difficulties were encountered in mobilizing the masses to repair the Fanshen Dyke sluice gate. The weather was very cold, and the water was deep. The gate could not be opened, and people were unwilling to go into the water to work. At this time, Zhou Benshun immediately took the lead in taking off his clothes and going into the cold, bone-chilling water, which was more than two feet deep. Cadre Ding Kunsheng, Party member Chen Ronghua, and 19 cooperative members also went into the water one after another. They struggled tensely in the water for more than two hours and finally opened the gate. After the water was released, more than 200 people, some carrying soil and some carrying stones, completed more than 50% of the sluice gate project in just a few days. The good news quickly spread throughout the cooperative, and everyone praised the good cadre from the county. Cooperative member She Erdie, who was over 50 years old, said: "With a good cadre like Lao Zhou to lead us, we are not afraid of not running the cooperative well in the future."

    吃苦在先的下乡干部
            张俊
    1956年12月13日一清早，望城县机关干部周本顺（共产党员）根据组织的决定他怀着愉快的心情来到翻身乡翻身社去了。
    刚到社里，他就发现冬修中存在很多问题，特别是兴修堤垸进度很慢，到12月13日止，只完成计划29.3％。全社四百一十六个男女全半劳动力，每天出工的只三十多人，十五个党员和七十八个团员，参加冬修和搞生产的只有四十多人。发现这些问题后，他立即去和党的支部、社委会研究，讨论冬修工作。在提高思想的基础上，把党员、团员分配到各队，分头发动群众，积极开展冬修。同时，周本顺自己深入到工作基础一向较差的第三队去，通过召开老农会、社员会，用算增产账、算时间账的办法，向群众说明冬修的重要。社员们认识了时间紧迫，都踊跃出工，原来工作较差的队也都赶上去了。
    1956年12月22日，在发动群众整修翻身垸水闸时遇到了困难。天气很冷，水又深，闸门开不动，人们都不愿下水去工作。这时，周本顺马上带头脱掉衣裤，下到两尺多深寒冷刺骨的水中去。干部丁坤生、党员陈荣华和十九个社员也先后下到水中去。他们在水中紧张搏斗两个多钟头，终于把闸门打开了。放光了水以后，二百多人有的挑土，有的抬石头，只几天工夫，就完成了水闸工程任务的50％以上。喜讯马上传遍了全社，大家都称赞县里来的好干部。五十多岁的社员佘二爹说：“我们有了老周这样的好干部来领导，不怕今后办不好社。”
