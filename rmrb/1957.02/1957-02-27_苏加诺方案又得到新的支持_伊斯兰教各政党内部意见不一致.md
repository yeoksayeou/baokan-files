Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, February 26th: Today's "Indonesian News" reported that some political parties continue to formally express support for the President's Plan. Leaders of the Association of Defenders of the Five Principles of Nationhood and the United Poor People's Party have both issued statements supporting the plan. The Chairman of the Greater Indonesia Party also stated his acceptance of the plan in order to achieve domestic peace. However, Islamic political parties, especially the Masyumi Party, are hesitant about President Sukarno's plan.

The newspaper reported that the Masyumi Party Central Committee held a meeting to discuss the plan. The elder statesmen within the party generally agreed with the plan and were willing to participate in a cooperative cabinet with the Indonesian Communist Party, as long as the Indonesian Communist Party did not occupy important positions in the cabinet. Opposing joining the cabinet with the Indonesian Communist Party are the so-called youth faction within the Masyumi Party, who have a certain influence in the central organs of the Masyumi Party.

The newspaper believes that there are also disagreements within the Islamic Teachers' Association and the Islamic League Party, which is why Islamic political parties are hesitant about the plan or unwilling to publicly express their attitude.

The newspaper quoted a source from the Central Committee of the Islamic Teachers' Association as saying that the chairman of the party's parliamentary group, Asin, had expressed his rejection of the President's Plan, which was Asin's personal opinion and not the position of the Islamic Teachers' Association. The Islamic Teachers' Association bears no responsibility for his remarks.

    苏加诺方案又得到新的支持
    伊斯兰教各政党内部意见不一致
    据新华社雅加达26日电　今天的“印度尼西亚新闻”说，一些政党继续正式表示支持总统方案。建国五基维护者协会和贫民统一党的领袖都发表了支持方案的声明。大印度尼西亚党主席也表示接受方案以实现国内和平。但是，伊斯兰教政党特别是马斯友美党对苏加诺总统方案抱着犹豫不决的态度。
    报纸说，马斯友美党中央委员会曾经举行会议讨论这个方案。党内的元老派一般表示同意方案，并且愿意同印度尼西亚共产党一起参加合作内阁，只要印度尼西亚共产党不占有内阁中的重要席位。反对同印度尼西亚共产党一起入阁的是马斯友美党内的所谓青年派，他们在马斯友美党的中央机构中有一定势力。
    报纸认为，伊斯兰教师联合会和伊斯兰联盟党内部意见也不一致，因此伊斯兰教政党对方案犹豫不决或者不愿公开表示态度。
    报纸引述伊斯兰教师联合会中央委员会人士的谈话说，这个党的国会议员团主席阿辛曾经表示拒绝总统方案，这是阿辛个人的意见而不是伊斯兰教师联合会的立场。伊斯兰教师联合会对他的谈话不负任何责任。
