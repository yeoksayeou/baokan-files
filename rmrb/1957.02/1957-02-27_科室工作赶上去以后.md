    After Catching Up on Department Work
    Xiao Han
    From July 1955 to the end of 1956, the Second Mine of the Yangquan Mining Bureau in Shanxi Province overfulfilled the state plan for eighteen consecutive months, reaching the 1957 production level one year ahead of schedule. Since then, a backward unit that had long failed to complete the state plan has become an advanced coal mine in Shanxi Province.
    What caused this mine to progress so quickly and achieve such results? In addition to the workers' selfless labor, an important factor was the transformation of the work style of the department staff, their deep engagement with reality and connection with the masses, and their close cooperation with various production links.
    The comrades in the department work of Yangquan Second Mine often recall the situation they were in more than a year ago. Because the planning department drew up plans that were divorced from reality, the workers said they were "drawing up blind plans with their eyes open"; because the wage department formulated unreasonable wage quotas, the workers called them the "guilty conscience department"... The leaders' reprimands, the workers' questions, and the big-character posters of the youth supervision posts made the department staff feel their faces burning whenever they met people.
    In fact, the weakness of the department work cannot be entirely blamed on the department staff; the Party committee leaders of the mine also bear responsibility. For a long time, the Party committee leaders of this mine did not pay enough attention to the importance of department work and the role of the department staff. Some Party committee leaders said: "Anyway, the departments can't dig coal, so what does it matter if the work is good or bad." Most Party committee members believed that department management work was something for "insiders" and that they were "outsiders" who didn't understand it and couldn't manage it.
    Due to the lessons of many facts and the direct assistance of the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee and the Yangquan Municipal Party Committee, the Yangquan Second Mine Party Committee deeply examined and criticized the idea of ​​not paying attention to department work from the first half of 1955 and began to strengthen its leadership over department work. First, in the division of labor among Party committee members, a dedicated person was assigned to focus on contacting the departments, and they went down the well with the department staff to conduct investigations and research and solicit opinions from the masses. In addition, engineers and comrades with expertise in management work were invited to explain coal mine management knowledge to the Party committee members. This strengthened the relationship between the Party committee members and the department staff, and also enabled the Party committee members to gradually understand coal mine management knowledge, so that when discussing production management issues in meetings, it was not just a few people speaking, but everyone could express their opinions and discuss them.
    After correcting the Party committee's failure to pay attention to department work and strengthening its leadership over department work, another deviation appeared, that is, many problems that could be directly solved by the departments were also brought to the Party committee for discussion and resolution. Some department staff members liked to pester Party committee members to go down the well together to solve problems, no matter what they were dealing with. In order to prevent the Party from taking over everything, in early 1956, Yangquan Second Mine promoted thirty department leading cadres based on their abilities and integrity, clarified the scope of their powers, and dispelled their concerns about being criticized and punished for making mistakes; in particular, they were given help and support in their actual work, thereby strengthening their confidence and enabling them to fully发挥 (fāhuī – give full play to) their enthusiasm and initiative in their work.
    Under the strengthened leadership of the Party committee, the work style of the departments has also undergone great changes. For example, in the past, when the comrades in the wage department transferred workers, they did not consult with the grassroots cadres, nor did they consult with the workers, fearing that the more they consulted, the harder it would be to handle things, and as a result, everyone was often unhappy. Now, when they transfer workers, they consult with the workers and grassroots cadres in advance, solicit their opinions, and get their ideas across before issuing orders to adjust. In 1956, they adjusted labor organization more than 400 times in this way, and assigned work to more than 400 new workers, basically achieving the goal of making the best use of everyone's talents, satisfying everyone, and benefiting production. Now, they all say: "It's easier to handle things when you discuss them with everyone."
    Closely cooperating and collaborating between departments around the central task is also an important transformation in the department work of Yangquan Second Mine. For example, in 1956, due to the increase in the number of cycles in the coal mining team, the tunneling work was relatively more backward. In order to enable tunneling to catch up with mining quickly, the engineer's office immediately began to study and summarize the mine's advanced experience in tunneling, and sent engineers to lead workers to visit brother factories; the wage department conscientiously implemented the tunneling progress incentive measures, and the geology department paid special attention to investigating the geological data of the new area. As a result, the tunneling work efficiency in the second half of the year increased by 25% compared with the first half of the year. By the end of last year, the prepared mining faces were sufficient for half a year of mining, ensuring a good connection between coal mining and tunneling. In the third quarter of 1956, Yangquan Second Mine began to establish a relatively complete procedure for the preparation and implementation of operational plans. The engineer's office formulated technical operating regulations adapted to the geological conditions and technical equipment of different mining areas according to this procedure, and the wage department stipulated several quotas for working under unfavorable geological conditions accordingly, making the plan, technology, and labor remuneration closely linked. For example, after the labor organization form of "dividing work by section and fixing operations" in the coal mining team was incorporated into the operating regulations, the wage department changed the original collective piece-rate wages to sectional piece-rate wages, which greatly stimulated the improvement of workers' technical level and mutual cooperation and competition, increasing the number of cycles per coal mining team by two compared with the past.
    In order to give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the department staff, they also organized competitions between departments. The competition conditions were shifted to management and technical problems that workers needed to solve in order to achieve the competition conditions. For example, in October 1956, when the mine promoted the method of replacing wooden pillars with metal pillars, the technical department took making good efforts to help workers formulate new operating regulations as the department competition condition, and the wage department took making good efforts to revise the quota unit price of pillar workers as the department competition condition. For those with the same business nature, comparable competition conditions were formulated, and those with different business natures were also rewarded as long as their own work was done well. Through the competition, not only was the enthusiasm and creativity of the department staff brought into play, but also the democratic style of the department leaders was cultivated.
    In addition, the Party committee also cared very much about the thoughts and lives of the department staff. In 1956, more than 60 department staff members applied to join the Party. The Party committee attached great importance to their requests, absorbed them to participate in Party classes, and also talked to them individually. By the end of last year, twenty-one department staff members had become probationary Party members. When Gao Ming, an engineer in the East Mining Area, had his wife giving birth in the hospital and there were still two children at home with no one to take care of them, Jia Zhongjin (Party member), the district chief of the mining area, volunteered to take his shift so that he could go home to take care of the children. After learning about the department staff who had real difficulties in their lives, the Party committee also suggested that the administration give appropriate subsidies.
    In this way, in the advanced producer movement of Yangquan Second Mine in 1956, half of the workers became advanced producers, and half of the department staff became advanced workers; among the twenty departments, nine became advanced units. Now, whenever the comrades in the department work think of their experience from being blamed to being praised, they always say: "This is because the Party committee attaches importance to us and cares about us in our work and thoughts!"

### 科室工作赶上去以后

    科室工作赶上去以后
    肖寒
    山西省阳泉矿务局二矿自1955年7月到1956年年底，连续十八个月超额完成了国家计划，提前一年达到1957年生产水平。从此，一个长期完不成国家计划的落后单位，变成了山西省的先进煤矿。
    是什么原因使这个矿进步得这样快和获得这样的成绩呢？除了工人们的忘我劳动外，科室工作人员转变工作作风，深入实际联系群众，并与各个生产环节密切配合则是个很重要的因素。
    阳泉二矿的科室工作同志，常常想起他们一年多以前所处的境地。由于计划科订的计划脱离实际，工人们就说他们是“睁着眼睛订瞎计划”；由于工薪科制定的工资定额不合理，工人就叫他们是“亏心科”……。领导上的斥责、工人们的质问，青年监督岗的大字报的批评，弄得科室工作同志见了人脸上都热辣辣的。
    其实，科室工作薄弱，不能完全归罪于科室工作人员，矿的党委领导同志也有责任。这个矿的党委领导同志长期以来对科室工作的重要性和科室工作人员的作用重视不够。有的党委领导同志说：“反正科室挖不出煤来，工作好坏有什么关系。”多数党委委员认为科室管理工作是“内行”干的事，自己是“外行”，不懂，没法管。
    由于许多事实的教训和中共山西省委、阳泉市委的直接帮助，阳泉二矿党委从1955年上半年深刻地检查和批判了不重视科室工作的思想，开始加强对科室工作的领导。首先在党委委员分工上，指定了专人重点联系科室，和科室工作人员一块深入井下，进行调查研究，征求群众意见。另外，又聘请工程师和在管理工作上有专长的同志给党委委员讲解煤矿管理知识。这样，就密切了党委委员和科室人员的关系，同时也使党委委员逐渐懂得了煤矿管理的知识，在开会讨论生产管理问题时，不只是少数人发言，而是大家都能发表意见展开讨论了。
    在纠正了党委不重视科室工作和加强了对科室工作的领导以后，又出现了另一种偏向，就是许多可以由科室直接解决的问题，也都拿来叫党委会讨论解决。有的科室工作人员每次深入井下，不管处理什么问题，总喜欢缠着党委委员一块下去解决。为了防止党包办代替，1956年初，阳泉二矿就根据德才兼备的条件，提拔了三十名科室负责干部，明确了他们的职权范围，打消了他们怕做错了受批评受处分的顾虑；特别是在实际工作中给予帮助和支持，从而加强了他们的信心，使他们在工作中充分发挥积极性和主动性。
    在党委加强领导下，科室工作作风也有了很大的转变。如工薪科的同志，过去调配工人，不和基层干部商量，也不和工人商量，怕愈商量愈不好办事，结果往往弄得大家都不愉快。现在，他们在调配工人时，都事先和工人、基层干部商量，征求他们的意见，打通他们的思想，然后才下令调整。1956年，他们就曾这样调整了劳动组织四百多人次，分配了四百多新工人的工作，基本上做到人尽其材，大家满意，有利生产。现在，他们都说：“和大家商量才好办事”。
    围绕中心工作，科室与科室之间密切配合协作，也是阳泉二矿科室工作的重要转变。如1956年由于采煤队循环次数的增加，掘进工作相对地更加落后了。为了使掘进迅速赶上开采，工程师室马上着手研究和总结本矿在掘进方面的先进经验，并派工程师带领工人到兄弟厂去参观；工薪科则认真贯彻执行掘进进度奖励办法，地质科特别注意勘查新区的地质资料。于是，下半年的掘进工效就比上半年提高了25％。到去年年底准备好的回采面已足够半年回采，保证了采煤和掘进的很好衔接。1956年第三季度，阳泉二矿开始建立了比较完善的作业计划的编制贯彻程序，工程师室就根据这个程序分别不同采煤区的地质条件和技术设备制定了相适应的技术作业规程，工薪科又依此规定了几种在不利的地质条件下工作的定额，使计划、技术、劳动报酬三者密切联系起来。再如采煤队“以段分工、固定操作”的劳动组织形式纳入作业规程以后，工薪科就把原来的集体计件工资改为分段计件工资，大大激发了工人技术水平的提高，以及相互间的协作与竞赛，每个采煤队比过去增加了两个循环。
    为了充分发挥科室工作人员的积极性和创造性，他们又组织科室之间展开竞赛。其竞赛条件是以工人为实现竞赛条件所要求解决的管理问题和技术问题为转移的。如1956年10月份，矿上推行以金属支柱代替木料支柱的操作方法，技术部门就以做好帮助工人制定新的操作规程为科室竞赛条件，工薪部门就以做好修正支柱工人的定额单价为科室竞赛条件。业务性质相同的制订可比性的竞赛条件，业务性质不相同的，只要本身工作做好了，也受到奖励。通过竞赛，不仅发挥了科室工作人员的积极性和创造性，也培养了科室领导人员的民主作风。
    除此以外，党委对于科室工作人员的思想和生活也是很关心的。1956年有六十多名科室工作人员要求入党，党委很重视他们的要求，吸收他们参加党课学习，又找他们个别谈话。到去年年底，已有二十一名科室工作人员成为预备党员。东采区工程师高明的爱人在医院生孩子，家里还有两个孩子没有人照管，采区区长贾钟金（党员）知道了，就替他值班，让他回家去照顾孩子。对于生活上确有困难的科室人员，党委了解后，也建议行政上给予适当补助。
    就这样，阳泉二矿在1956年先进生产者运动中，有一半工人成了先进生产者，有一半科室人员成了先进工作者；在二十个科室中，有九个成了先进单位。现在，科室工作同志每当想起他们从受责难到受赞扬的经历时，总说：“这是因为党委重视我们，从工作上、思想上关心我们的结果！”
