Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, 18th Dispatch: While maintaining "boom" conditions, the West German economy has shown a slowing trend in its expansion. Some industries are already experiencing relatively serious product sales problems.

Compared to the British industry, which is currently almost stagnant, West German industry has surpassed it in many aspects and occupies second place in the capitalist world, second only to the United States.

West German steel's annual output began to exceed Britain's the year before last and continued to increase in 1956. If the Saar region is included, it has reached more than 26 million tons. West German machinery's annual output and machinery exports both exceeded Britain's in 1956, ranking first in Western Europe. Although West German automobile production still lags behind the United States and Britain, West German automobile exports had already exceeded both countries in the first half of 1956, ranking first in the capitalist world. In 1956, West German industrial output value reached four-fifths of Britain's. According to newspaper reports, Ruhr industrialists want to make West German industrial output value reach 90% of Britain's in 1957, and surpass Britain by 1960, restoring Germany's pre-war second-place position in the capitalist world.

In 1956, West Germany had a trade surplus of $600 million, and West Germany's gold and dollar reserves reached more than $4 billion, far exceeding the British pound and French franc. West Germany has regained its "traditional" Western European market. In the total import value of the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Austria, Switzerland, and Sweden, West Germany has defeated the United States, Britain, and other countries and jumped to first place. Latin America has become West Germany's second most important market after Western Europe. In Iran's total import value, the percentage occupied by West Germany has increased from 5.8% five years ago to 7.1%, while the percentage occupied by Britain has decreased from 28% to 8.9%. West German exports to the Far East have now exceeded pre-war figures by nearly one-fold.

The speed of West German industrial output increase in 1956 was slower than in 1955. The percentage increase in West German industrial output value in previous years was: 10% in 1953, 10.5% in 1954, and 15% in 1955; it decreased to about 9% in 1956. The number of unemployed people in West Germany in January 1957 was 223,700 more than in January last year, the highest figure in three years. About 8% to 10% of West German industrial production capacity cannot be fully utilized.

Recently, there has been increasing discussion in West German industrial and commercial circles about "how long the boom can last." Some people advocate shrinking and restricting investment and preventing excessive credit and currency inflation—it is worth noting that discount rates and interest rates have been raised repeatedly in 1956—; some people advocate manufacturing more military weapons; some people advocate expanding trade with the Soviet Union and China.

### 西德经济不少方面已赶过英国  但扩张速度开始减慢　有些行业发生销路问题

    西德经济不少方面已赶过英国
    但扩张速度开始减慢　有些行业发生销路问题
    据新华社18日讯　波恩消息：西德经济在过去一年中继续保持“景气”，但它的扩张速度已经有减慢的趋势，有些行业已经发生较严重的产品销路问题。
    西德工业比起目前几乎处在停滞状态的英国工业来，已经在不少方面超过了它而在资本主义世界占据仅次于美国的第二位。
    西德钢的年产量继前年开始超过英国后，在1956年又续有增加，如果连萨尔合计在内，它已达到二千六百多万吨。西德机器年产量和机器出口量在1956年都超过了英国、居西欧第一位。西德汽车产量虽然还落后于美英两国，但是西德汽车出口量在1956年上半年就已经超过这两国而居资本主义世界第一位。1956年西德工业总产值已达到英国的五分之四。据报纸报道：鲁尔工业家想要使西德工业总产值在1957年达到英国的90％，到1960年超过英国，恢复德国在战前占资本主义世界第二位的地位。
    1956年西德在对外贸易上出超六亿美元，西德马克的黄金美元储备达到了四十多亿美元，为英镑和法郎所望尘莫及。西德已经夺回它“传统”的西欧市场。在荷、比、卢、奥、瑞士和瑞典等国的进口总值中，西德已经击败美英等国而跃居第一位。拉丁美洲已经成为西德仅次于西欧的第二个最重要的市场。在伊朗的进口总值中，西德所占的百分比已从五年前的5.8％增加到7.1％，而英国所占的百分比却从28％下降到8.9％。西德对远东的出口现在已经超过战前数字将近一倍。
    1956年西德工业产量增加的速度比1955年慢。前几年西德工业总产值增加的百分比是：1953年10％，1954年10.5％，1955年15％；它在1956年却减少到9％左右。西德失业人数在1957年1月比去年1月多二十二万三千七百，是三年来的最高数字。西德工业生产能力约有8％到10％不能充分利用。
    西德工商业界最近关于“景气还能持续几时”的谈论越来越多。有些人主张收缩和限制投资并且防止信用和通货的过度膨胀——值得注意的是，1956年已经一再提高贴现率和利率——；有些人主张多制造些军火武器；有些人主张扩大对苏联和对中国的贸易。
