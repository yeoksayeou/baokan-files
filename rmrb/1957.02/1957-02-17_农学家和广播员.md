    They are two very close friends. They have been going to school together and playing together since they were young. Now they are both over thirty and approaching forty, but their "childlike heart" has not diminished. A beautiful sweet song, a novel by Turgenev, a picture depicting the calm sea before dawn, all can evoke their old memories. Often, they don't see each other for three or five years, but when they meet again, they are as close as if they had just parted after school yesterday. This time, however, the separation was the longest, seven or eight years, with no news.

    The shorter of the two friends, judging by his work in the agricultural college and the subjects he studied, is an agricultural chemist. He studies the relationship between soil, plants, and fertilizers, and uses chemical methods to solve agricultural problems, which is one of the important projects in the twelve-year plan to advance towards science. He explores the secrets of life in nature, talks to plants, and always has a focused and contemplative look on his face.

    Once, when he and the students of the agricultural college went to a state-owned farm in the Heilongjiang River basin for a short-term production practice, one morning, in order to investigate the high-yield experience of a local agricultural model worker, he came out of the tent just as the sky was breaking. His heavy leather boots stepped on the frozen and solid ground, making a crisp cracking sound. It was early spring, and the fresh smell of the soil wafted over his face. He even felt that the land was awakening. In the vast white and cold morning mist, a beautiful little deer timidly ran away from the tractor.

    After a day of extremely intense work, near dusk, the short, sturdy agronomist returned to the tent. His students were gathered around a "Dongfanghong" brand radio, listening to the broadcast. They heard the breathing of Beijing and Shanghai, the vague and distant human voices and the sounds of silk strings, and the footsteps of the great motherland marching towards socialism!

    By chance, he switched to a radio station, and the sound gradually became clearer. The broadcaster's cadence and intonation made people stop and listen quietly. It turned out to be a broadcast about agricultural production technology issues, but it was told in such a dramatic way, as if an experienced actor was reciting lines, permeated with touching emotion. The agronomist was first amazed by the specialization of the report content and the broadcaster's proficiency in explaining it. Even someone like him, who had been engaged in the research of this science for a long time, thought that this section on advanced agricultural production technology was well-organized and "quite knowledgeable"; secondly, he was very satisfied with the sincere attitude of the broadcaster when speaking to the farmers, as if they were family. When the broadcaster talked about how to turn wilderness into fertile fields in a gentle and moving way, it was as attractive as telling a beautiful story. It is conceivable that such a broadcast program would undoubtedly be warmly welcomed by the vast number of farmer listeners, and they would follow his words to solve certain agricultural problems, thereby improving the quality of cultivation and increasing the yield per unit area.

    In addition to admiration, the agronomist suddenly froze for a moment. That cheerful and bright tone sounded a bit like Bao Luo's voice! How familiar! Bao Luo, wasn't he working at a radio station in a big city in the South when the country was liberated? When he first joined as a radio broadcaster, in order to fight against "dropping the screw" (making mistakes), how many times did he practice facing the silent walls every day before he overcame the stage fright that every broadcaster inevitably experienced when they first went on the air! Later, he heard that he was assigned to another province to independently support the newly established local radio station, but there had been no news for many years. Just in the moment when the agronomist was lost in thought, this program came to an end, and the last sentence sent out from the radio was: "The above program was broadcast by Lin Bao Luo." Completely confirmed! The agronomist strained his ears, trying to catch those last few words, but then he only heard a burst of gongs and drums. The radio occasionally made noise, and then it was turned off.

    That night, the agronomist was very excited. Since arriving at this farm, he had gradually become accustomed to the vastness of the heaven and earth, the endless fertile black soil, and the footprints of animals walking on the untouched virgin land, and now he actually heard the voice of an old friend he had been separated from for seven years in such a magical place!

    Is it really Bao Luo? Based on the location of the people's radio station in that province, he wrote a letter that night, huddling in the lamplight.

    In the days of waiting for a reply, he was busy with his work as usual during the day, engaged in the research of breeding and demonstration cultivation of fine varieties. At night, he almost waited eagerly by the radio, hoping to hear the familiar voice of his old friend again. However, either because of the influence of wind direction and climate, after listening for a long time, he found that the kilocycle was a little off, and he switched to the broadcasting station of Inner Mongolia; or because he was too busy with work, he missed the listening time. In short, he never received that program that was particularly meaningful to the agronomist again. It was as if the sound had suddenly disappeared from the earth, and he felt a sense of loss.

    He suspected that he might have misheard that night. In this cold and windy northeast wilderness, it was entirely possible that the radio wave frequency was not fixed. So, dear Bao Luo, where are you exactly? Can you hear my distant cry? For several nights, the agronomist stood alone outdoors, looking up at the cold blue steel-like night sky and the twinkling cold stars, as if he wanted to broadcast to his old friend, who was unknown in which part of the motherland, through the radio waves generated by his mind, and as if he wanted to use his completely open mind to search for the joyful voice of that old friend in the air above the farms spanning millions of acres...

    When he finally received a reply, it had been quite a while. He and his classmates had finished their production practice and returned to the agricultural college. Bao Luo's enthusiastic letter was waiting for him. It was still so humorous, with a bit of romantic fantasy, and, more importantly, he was full of energy. It seemed that he was happier than before. Bao Luo said that he had recently finished reading many books on acting and cultivation, and he wanted to further study the performance methods of stage art. This inevitably made people wonder: was he changing careers to become an actor? No. The reason why he studied acting was only because he wanted to do a better job in broadcasting. "Broadcasting is also an art. I want to use the cultivation of actors to enrich the art of broadcasting," he said with confidence. His efforts had earned him many friends. Farmers often wrote letters to him, discussing agricultural issues with him. He was proud of this, and felt that it was the greatest happiness in life.

    "Actually, it's very easy to hear my voice," he wrote at the end. "Every day at 11:00 am and after 7:00 pm, you can hear my voice. The whole country can hear my voice. These days, I am broadcasting the news of the earth's return to spring to the audience, isn't it?" Listen to his tone! The agronomist couldn't help but smile.

    That night, the agricultural chemist finally heard his old friend's broadcast again in his dormitory. It was a news report. The broadcaster enthusiastically talked about the great achievements of our country's socialist construction in the past year, as if he was reciting a poem of peace and labor. The agronomist seemed to feel that the broadcaster specially emphasized certain words because he was also listening to the broadcast. This tacit understanding of friendship between the radio broadcaster and the agronomist, who was one of the millions of listeners, filled his heart with sweet warmth for a long time. He found that their friendship was more meaningful than ever.

    农学家和广播员
    何为
    他们是两个友谊非常深厚的好朋友。从少年时代起就结伴上学，一同游戏，至今都已是三十以上快近四十的人了，而“赤子之心”不减当年。一支美丽的甜歌，一本屠格涅夫的小说，一张描绘黎明前大海平静无波的画片，都会唤起他们旧日的记忆。往往三、五年不见面，见了面可还是像昨日放学刚刚分开一样融洽无间。而这一回分别的时间最长，一别七、八年，音讯杳然。
    个子较矮的那个朋友，就他在农学院里的工作及其所研究的学科说来，是个农业化学家。他研究土壤、植物和肥料三者之间的相互关系，用化学方法解决农业问题，属于向科学进军的十二年规划中重要项目之列。他向自然界探究生命的秘密，和植物谈心，脸上永远带着专注的沉思神气。
    那一次他和农学院的学生们到黑龙江流域一个国营农场去进行短期生产实习时，有一天早上，为了调查当地一位农业模范的丰产经验，天刚刚破晓，他就从帐篷里出来。厚重的大皮靴踩在冰冻坚实的土地上，发出干脆的裂响。是早春了，新鲜的泥土气息扑面而来，他甚至感觉到土地正在苏醒。在白茫茫粘冷的晨雾中，一头美丽的小鹿怯生生地迎着拖拉机溜开去了。
    经过了一天极其紧张的工作之后，临近天黑，这个矮矮的结实的农学家回到帐篷里。这时他的学生们围着一架“东方红”牌子的收音机正在收听广播。听见了北京和上海的呼吸，听见了模糊而又遥远的人语声和丝弦杂作的声音，听见了伟大的祖国走向社会主义的脚步声！
    偶然转到一个电台，声音逐渐清晰起来，广播员抑扬顿挫的声调，不由使人驻足静听。原来是一段关于农业生产技术问题的广播，却讲得这样富有戏剧性，如同有经验的演员在朗诵台词，渗透了动人的感情。农学家首先为报告内容的专门和讲解的熟练感到惊异，即使像他这样对这门科学长期从事研究的人，都认为这一节农业生产先进技术讲得头头是道，“颇有学问”；其次，他很满意那个广播员面对农民说话时那种亲如家人的真挚态度，当广播员娓娓动人地谈到如何把荒野变成良田时，仿佛在讲一段优美的故事那样富有吸引力。可以想像，这样的广播节目无疑会受到广大农民听众的热烈欢迎，并且会按照他的话来解决农业上的某些问题，从而改进耕作质量，提高单位面积产量。
    农学家赞赏之余，刹那间，他忽然呆住了。那快乐的明朗的调子，听起来真有点像宝罗的声音！多么熟悉啊！宝罗，全国解放时，他不是在南方一个大城市里的电台工作么？当他刚进去担任电台广播员时，为了和“吃螺丝”作斗争，每天对着沉默的墙壁练上多少次，才战胜了每一个初上电台的广播员不可避免的上场慌！后来听说他被派到另一省份，独当一面地支持当地新成立的电台，可是数年来不通讯息。就在农学家默然出神的那一瞬间，这一段节目宣告结束，收音机里送出来最后的一句话：“以上这个节目是由林宝罗播送的。”完全证实了！农学家凑上耳朵去，竭力捕捉那最后几个字眼，但接下去只听见一片锣鼓声，收音机时而发出杂音，旋即被关上了。
    这一夜农学家非常激动。自从到了这个农场以后，他渐渐习惯了那辽阔的天地，那一望无垠的肥沃的黑土，那未开垦的处女地上走过的动物的足音，而现在他竟在这样一个神奇的地方听见了分别七年的老朋友的声音！
    真是宝罗吗？他根据那一个省份的人民电台所在的地点，当夜就凑着灯光写了一封信。
    在等待回信的日子里，白天他照常忙于工作，从事良种繁殖和示范栽培的研究，晚上几乎带着渴望的心情守候在收音机旁，期待着再一次听见老朋友熟悉的声音。然而，或是因为风向和气候的影响，听了半天，结果发现千周偏了一点，转到内蒙古的广播电台去了；或者由于工作过于繁忙，耽误了收听时间。总之，再也没有收到那一节对农学家来说是特别有意义的节目，好像那声音突然从大地上消失了一样，不胜惆怅。
    他怀疑也许那天晚上是听错了。在这气候严寒风向不定的东北原野上，电波频率不固定完全是可能的事。那么，亲爱的宝罗，你究竟在哪儿呢？你可曾听见我遥远的呼喊？有好几个夜晚，农学家独自站在户外，仰望蓝钢般冷森森的夜空和闪烁的寒星，像是要通过他心灵所产生的电波，向不知在祖国哪一方的老朋友广播似的，又像要用他全部开放的心灵，在纵横数百万亩的农场上空，寻觅那个老朋友快乐的声音……
    当他终于收到回信的时候，已经隔了好些时候，他和同学们结束了生产实习任务，回到了农学院。宝罗热情的信在等着他。还是那样风趣，带着几分浪漫蒂克的幻想色彩，而且，重要的是他劲头十足，看来他是比从前更快乐了。宝罗说，最近他接连看完了好多本关于演技修养方面的书，还要进一步研究舞台艺术的表演方法。这就不免令人奇怪：是为了改行去当演员吗？不。他之所以钻研演技，只是因为想把广播工作做得更好，“广播也是一种艺术，我要用演员修养来丰富广播艺术”，他满怀信心地说。他的努力使他赢得了许多朋友，农民们经常写信给他，和他讨论农业问题，他引以为骄傲，觉得这是生命中最大的幸福。
    “其实，要听我的声音是很容易的”，最后他写道：“每天上午十一时和下午七时以后，都可以听到我的声音，全国都可以听到我的声音，这几天我正在向听众们广播大地回春的消息，不是吗？”听他的口气！农学家忍不住微笑了。
    这天晚上，农业化学家在自己的宿舍里终于又听到老朋友的广播了。那是一段新闻报道。广播员热情横溢地谈到过去一年间我国社会主义建设的巨大成就，就像是在朗诵一首和平与劳动的诗篇。农学家似乎感到广播员特别强调的某些字眼，是由于他也在收听广播的缘故，这种介乎电台广播员和作为千万个听众里面一个的农学家之间友谊的默契，使他心里长久充满了甜蜜的温馨。他发现，他们的友谊比以往任何时期都更有意义了。
