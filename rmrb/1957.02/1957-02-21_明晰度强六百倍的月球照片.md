    Moon Photo with 600 Times Greater Clarity

    The Soviet Union has recently successfully tested a method of photographing the moon using television equipment. The resulting photographs of the lunar surface are six hundred times clearer than those obtained through ordinary telescopes.

    The new photographic method involves projecting the image of the moon onto a television screen through special equipment, and then photographing it with a camera, requiring an exposure time of only one-fiftieth of a second. However, when using a telescope for photography, the exposure time has to be extended due to the faintness of the light. Consequently, image vibrations caused by atmospheric instability would greatly impair the clarity of the photographs.

    明晰度强六百倍的月球照片
    苏联最近试验成功了用电视装置对月球进行摄影的方法。它比普通用望远镜来摄影所得的月球表面照片要清晰六百倍。
    新的摄影方法使月球的影像通过特别的装置投射在电视幕上，然后用摄影机对它拍摄，曝光时间只要五十分之一秒就够了。但是，如果用望远镜来摄影，因为光线微弱，不得不延长曝光时间；这样，由于大气的不稳定而引起的影像颤动便会使照片的明晰度大大受损。
