Xinhua News Agency, February 22nd - A total of thirteen counties (cities) across the country have seen their average per-mu grain yield exceed the 1967 targets proposed in the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft). In the first crop hall of the National Agricultural Exhibition is a huge map, marked with the 1967 grain production increase targets to be achieved in three regions: north of the Yellow River and Qinling Mountains, north of Bailong River, between the Yellow and Huai Rivers, south of the Huai River in the Yangtze River basin, and the Pearl River basin, namely 400 jin, 500 jin, and 800 jin. The map's caption notes: In 1956, thirteen counties (cities) nationwide had already reached and surpassed these targets.

The thirteen counties (cities) belonging to the 800-jin region include Longxi County in Fujian, with an average per-mu yield of 1,197 jin for all grain crops in 1956; followed by Chao'an County in Guangdong at 1,157 jin, Puning County at 1,071 jin, Jieyang County at 1,034 jin, and Chaoyang County at 1,003 jin; and then Xiaogan County in Hubei at 860 jin, and Huangpi County at 808 jin. In the 500-jin region, there is Huang County in Shandong at 599 jin. In the 400-jin region, there is Zhengding County in Hebei Province at 496 jin, followed by Xianyang City in Shaanxi at 427 jin, Chang'an County at 426 jin, Meng County in Henan at 409 jin, and Gaocheng County in Hebei at 401 jin.

These counties (cities) achieved increased production by expanding the multiple cropping index. The high-yield counties (cities) in the northern and central regions adopted continuous cropping of wheat and corn and other coarse grains. Some southern regions not only cultivated double-cropping rice but also continued with sweet potatoes and other coarse grains in winter, while others practiced rice-wheat rotation. In the past year, these counties (cities) encountered natural disasters of different types and severity. Thanks to the extremely favorable conditions brought about by collectivization, they devised various methods to increase production, finally overcoming natural disasters and achieving the 1967 grain production increase targets within one year.

This newspaper reports - According to last year's experience and lessons, Songjiang Special District in Jiangsu Province is planning this year's double-cropping rice planting area based on local conditions and agricultural cooperative conditions. The preliminary plan is to cultivate 400,000 mu of double-cropping rice throughout the district, accounting for about 13% of the total rice area, an increase of 100,000 mu compared to last year's actual planting area.

After agricultural cooperation was realized in the Songjiang Special District last year, more than 300,000 mu of double-cropping rice was promoted for the first time, with an average yield of 629.4 jin per mu, an increase of 27.7% compared to single-cropping rice. Yields exceeding 1,000 jin were observed in various locations. The entire district increased grain production by more than 25 million jin through the promotion of double-cropping rice, and most agricultural cooperatives increased their net income. However, due to the excessive planned planting area for double-cropping rice last year, the labor force, fertilizer, and technical experience were not adequate, so a large amount had to be reduced later, resulting in a loss of more than 9 million jin of seeds and more than 2.7 million dan of green manure. A small number of agricultural cooperatives even experienced production and income reductions. Therefore, the experience and lessons learned from planting double-cropping rice in the district last year prove that promoting double-cropping rice is one of the key factors in increasing grain production, but attention must be paid to specific conditions such as seasons, labor force, and fertilizer.

This year, after a series of investigations and discussions with the masses, the district has decided to further consolidate double-cropping rice while vigorously improving per-mu yield, develop double-cropping rice under certain conditions in some areas, continue to implement the spirit of "sowing one mu and succeeding on one mu," and strive for a greater harvest of double-cropping rice than last year. In Songjiang, Jinshan, Qingpu and other areas where double-cropping rice was planted extensively last year, consolidation will be the main focus, and the area will be adjusted reasonably based on various material conditions. The total area of double-cropping rice in these three counties will be reduced from 300,000 mu last year to more than 230,000 mu. In Fengxian, Nanhui and other areas where the planting area was small last year but outstanding harvests were achieved, the area will be developed conditionally from more than 15,000 mu last year to 170,000 mu this year, achieving a balance between consolidation and development. In Jiading, Baoshan and other places where the trial planting of double-cropping rice last year did not yield high yields and there were more problems, small-scale trial planting will continue this year.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, February 22nd, reported by Xinhua News Agency reporters Ma Zhongming and Liu Guanghui: Last year, in the agricultural technology reform of promoting the conversion of intercropping double-cropping rice to continuous double-cropping rice, a season of grain production was reduced due to some shortcomings in the work. Should this measure be continued this year? After mobilizing the masses for discussion and investigation and research, the Pingxiang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party of Jiangxi Province decided to continue to actively promote this production increase measure, but emphasized that it must be adapted to local conditions.

Of the more than 590,000 mu of paddy fields in Pingxiang County, more than 530,000 mu were planted with intercropping double-cropping rice last year. After the county achieved agricultural cooperation last year, based on the past experience of many farmers that converting intercropping to continuous cropping could increase production, under the mobilization of the Pingxiang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, agricultural cooperatives converted more than 70% of the intercropping double-cropping rice fields to continuous cropping. As a result of the conversion, early rice achieved an unprecedented harvest, exceeding the total annual rice output of the previous year, but the late rice of many agricultural cooperatives was reduced, and the county's late rice was reduced by more than 30 million jin. Therefore, after the autumn harvest, many cooperative members in the reduced-production cooperatives complained, saying that last year's late rice reduction was due to the conversion of intercropping to continuous cropping, and when formulating this year's production increase measures, they proposed no longer promoting continuous cropping. Cadres were afraid of being blamed by the cooperative members due to last year's lessons, and they did not dare to lead boldly anymore.

When considering the formulation of this year's production plan, the Pingxiang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party promptly studied the above situation and led the county's agricultural cooperatives to conduct discussions on this issue: Is the reason for last year's late rice reduction that the measure of converting intercropping to continuous cropping was not good? Or were there problems in the promotion work? The agricultural cooperatives conducted investigations into the causes and sought experiences from summarizing production. After inspection, it was unanimously believed that last year's loss and reduction of some late rice was the result of not adapting to local conditions and blindly converting the planting. According to the results of the inspection statistics, more than 50,000 mu of lost continuous late rice last year were all because the water conservancy conditions were not available, and there was a drought after the early rice was harvested, of which more than 30,000 mu had no seedlings transplanted at all because of this, and the more than 20,000 mu that were reluctantly transplanted soon died of drought. In addition, more than 120,000 mu of continuous late rice were planted when rushing to harvest early rice and rushing to transplant late rice. Due to the lack of labor allocation and the crude work done, coupled with the lack of complete water conservancy facilities, they also suffered different degrees of drought when encountering drought, resulting in reduced production. In addition, more than 20,000 mu of continuous late rice were planted in the cold paddy fields at the foot of the mountains, and they did not grow well. On the contrary, all those who implemented adapting to local conditions, with sufficient labor and water conservancy conditions, achieved the same bumper harvest for late rice as for early rice. Generally, the yield per mu was 100 to 200 jin more than intercropping. After Xincun Agricultural Cooperative converted 90% of the intercropping double-cropping rice to continuous cropping last year, the average per-mu yield of double-cropping rice in the entire cooperative reached more than 1,100 jin, an increase of 20% compared to 1955, of which late rice increased by 32%.

While conducting universal discussions and inspections, the county party committee also sent three working groups to conduct detailed investigations on labor, water conservancy, and natural conditions in three types of areas: mountainous, hilly, and plains, to study which areas are suitable for planting continuous double-cropping rice. After the investigation, according to the characteristics of intercropping to continuous cropping requiring more labor and longer water use time, different requirements were put forward according to the different conditions in various places. In the western region, where the fields are flat, the soil is good, the water conservancy is sufficient, there is more labor and less land, the production season is earlier, it is suitable for converting intercropping to continuous cropping, and most of the conversion to continuous cropping last year was successful, it is still determined to universally promote continuous cropping. In most areas of the northern hilly area, water conservancy or labor conditions are not yet fully available, and this year the area of converting intercropping to continuous cropping will be reduced from 90% last year to 40%. In some mountainous areas in the southeast, most of the paddy fields are cold and deep in mud. The production season is more than ten days later than other regions, and at the same time, there are more fields and fewer people, the fields are scattered, and the farming technology is also rougher. This year, the main task is to further improve the cultivation techniques of intercropping double-cropping rice and increase the yield.

The universal discussions have not only improved farmers' confidence in planting double-cropping rice; the requirements put forward by the county party committee are also suitable for the conditions in various places, so the enthusiasm of rural work cadres and farmers for technical reforms and production has been improved. According to the plan, although the area of continuous double-cropping rice in this county this year is only about 200,000 mu, a decrease of nearly 46% compared to last year, people have the confidence to complete this year's plan to increase rice production by 11% compared to last year.

    扩大复种指数　推行连作办法
    十三个县（市）突破1967年粮食增产指标
    松江专区合理规划扩大双季稻面积，萍乡县因地制宜推行间作改连作
    新华社22日讯　全国已有十三个县（市）的全县粮食平均亩产量，突破了农业发展纲要（草案）所提出的1967年的指标。在全国农业展览会的农作物第一馆里有一幅巨大的地图，标明着：黄河秦岭、白龙江以北、黄淮之间、淮河以南长江流域和珠江流域三种地区在1967年要达到的粮食增产指标四百斤、五百斤和八百斤。而在地图的两侧说明：1956年全国已经有十三个县（市）分别达到了指标并且超过了。
    这十三个县（市）属于八百斤地区的有福建龙溪县，1956年全县粮食作物平均亩产量是一千一百九十七斤；其次是广东潮安县一千一百五十七斤，普宁县一千零七十一斤，揭阳县一千零三十四斤，潮阳县一千零三斤；再次是湖北孝感县八百六十斤，黄陂县八百零八斤。属于五百斤地区的有山东黄县五百九十九斤。属于四百斤地区的有河北省正定县四百九十六斤，其次是陕西咸阳市四百二十七斤，长安县四百二十六斤，河南孟县四百零九斤，河北藁城县四百零一斤。
    这些县（市）都是采用扩大复种指数的办法获得增产的，北部和中部地区的高额丰产县（市）是采用麦子和玉米等杂粮连作的办法，南部地区有的是在双季稻以外还在冬季连作甘薯等杂粮，有的是稻麦连作。在去年一年中，这些县（市）也曾遇到不同种类和不同程度的自然灾害，由于利用合作化带给生产上的极有利的条件，想出各种办法来增产，终于战胜自然灾害，在一年时期内就达到了1967年的粮食增产指标。
    本报讯　江苏省松江专区根据去年的经验教训，因地因社制宜地规划今年种植双季稻面积。全区双季稻面积初步规划为四十万亩，约占水稻总面积13％，比去年实种面积增加十万亩。
    松江专区在去年农业合作化后，第一次推广了三十多万亩双季稻，平均单位面积产量达到六百二十九点四斤，比单季稻增产27.7％，高达千斤以上的，各地都有发现。全专区由于推广双季稻共计增产粮食二千五百多万斤，并使大部分农业社增加了纯收益。但是，由于去年原来规划种植双季稻面积过大，无论是劳动力、肥料和技术经验都不相适应，后来只得大量压缩，约计损失了九百余万斤种子和二百七十余万担绿肥；少数农业社并因此减产减收。所以，全区去年种植双季稻的经验教训证明：推广种植双季稻是增产粮食的重要关键之一，但必须注意根据季节、劳动力、肥料等具体条件。
    今年，经过一系列的调查研究和同群众商量，全区确定在大力提高单位面积产量的同时，进一步巩固双季稻，部分地区有条件地发展双季稻，继续贯彻“种一亩、成功一亩”的精神，争取双季稻比去年更大的丰收。在松江、金山、青浦等去年种植双季稻面积较多的地区，以巩固为主，并根据各方面物质条件，合理调整面积。这三个县双季稻总面积将由去年的三十万亩压缩到二十三万余亩。在奉贤、南汇等去年种植面积较小又获得突出丰收的地区，今年将有条件地由一万五千余亩发展到十七万亩，做到巩固与发展并重。嘉定、宝山等地去年试种的双季稻产量不高，问题也较多，今年仍然进行小面积试种。
    据新华社南昌22日电　新华社记者马锺明、刘光辉报道：去年在推行间作双季稻改为连作双季稻的农业技术改革中，由于工作上有些缺点造成一季粮食减产，今年是不是还要推行？中共江西省萍乡县委经过发动群众讨论和调查研究后，决定继续积极推行这项增产措施，但是强调必须因地制宜。
    萍乡县的五十九万多亩稻田中，去年有五十三万多亩种植间作双季稻。去年全县实现农业合作化以后，根据过去许多农民将间作改为连作可以增产的经验，各农业社在中共萍乡县委的发动下，把70％以上的间作双季稻田改为连作。改种的结果，早稻虽获得了空前丰收，使全年水稻总产量超过前一年，但许多农业社的晚稻却减了产，全县晚稻共减产三千多万斤。因此，秋后许多减产社社员怨言纷纷，说去年晚稻减产是因为间作改了连作，在制订今年增产措施时，提出不再推行连作。干部有去年的教训，怕社员埋怨，也不敢再大胆领导。
    中共萍乡县委在考虑制订今年的生产计划时及时研究了上述情况，领导全县农业社对这个问题开展了讨论：去年晚稻减产是间作改连作的措施不好？还是在推广工作中有毛病？各农业社从总结生产中，进行了查原因，找经验，经过检查，一致认为去年部分晚稻的失收和减产是没有因地制宜、盲目改种的结果。据检查结果统计，去年有五万多亩失收的连作晚稻都是因为水利条件不具备，早稻收割后又遇上天旱，其中三万多亩便因此根本没有插秧，勉强插下秧的二万多亩不久也就旱死了。还有十二万多亩连作晚稻在抢收早稻和抢插晚稻时，因劳动力调配不开，工夫作得粗糙，加上水利设施不够完备，遇到天旱也遭受了不同程度的旱灾，造成减产。此外，还有二万多亩连作晚稻是插在山脚下的冷浆田里，生长不好。相反，凡是贯彻了因地制宜，劳力、水利条件充足，晚稻与早稻同样都获得了丰收。一般每亩都要比间作增产稻谷一、二百斤。新村农业社去年90％间作双季稻改为连作后，全社双季稻平均单位面积产量达到一千一百多斤，比1955年增产20％，其中晚稻增产32％。
    在普遍讨论和进行检查的同时，县委还派出三个工作组，分赴山地、丘陵和平原三种类型的地区对劳动力、水利、自然条件等作了详细的调查，研究哪些地区适合种植连作双季稻。调查之后，根据间作改连作用工多和需水时间长的特点，按照各地不同的情况，提出了不同的要求。对田地平坦、土质好、水利充分、劳力多田少、生产季节较早，适宜间作改连作，而在去年改为连作又大部获得成功的西部地区，仍确定普遍推广连作。北部丘陵地区大部地方水利或劳动力条件尚不完全具备，今年间作改连作的面积由去年的90％降为40％。东南部一些山区，稻田大多水冷泥深。生产季节较其它地区迟十多天，同时田多人少，田地分散，耕作技术也较粗糙，今年则主要是进一步改进间作双季稻的栽培技术，提高产量。
    普遍的讨论，既提高了农民种植双季稻的信心；县委提出的要求，又适合各地的情况，因此，农村工作干部和农民进行技术改革和生产的积极性提高了。根据计划，这个县今年连作双季稻的面积尽管只有二十万亩左右，比去年减少将近46％，但是，人们都有信心完成今年水稻比去年增产11％的计划。
