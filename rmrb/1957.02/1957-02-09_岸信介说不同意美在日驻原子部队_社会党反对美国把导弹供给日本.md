Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 8th: Tokyo dispatch: Acting Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi said today during a session of the House of Representatives Budget Committee, in response to questioning from the opposition party, that from the perspective of national sentiment and defense, he agreed that atomic weapons should not be brought into Japan.

He said that if the United States indicated it wanted to station atomic mobile forces in Japan, Japan would autonomously decide its attitude. He said he believed the Japanese government had no intention of agreeing to such a request.

Kishi Nobusuke also stated, in response to questioning from Socialist Party member Hiroo Wada, that he would strive to abolish the Japan-US "Security Treaty." He said that the current domestic and international situations in Japan are different from those at the time of the signing of the "Security Treaty" and "Administrative Agreement."

However, Kishi Nobusuke also said that to amend and abolish the "Security Treaty," it is first necessary to gradually strengthen self-defense capabilities and to obtain the consent of the United States. He rejected the request from Socialist Party members to set a deadline for amending and abolishing the "Security Treaty."

Socialist Party member Hiroo Wada questioned the abolition of the Japan-US "Security Treaty" and the import of US missiles into Japan today. He disagreed with Kishi Nobusuke's statement about abolishing the "Security Treaty," believing that if it required US consent, it would never be possible to amend or abolish it. He also criticized past cabinets for only showing defense plans to the United States and not to the Diet.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 7th: Tokyo dispatch: The Japan Socialist Party vehemently opposes the United States supplying missiles to Japan. Socialist Party Secretary-General Inajiro Asanuma said today that the decision to supply missiles to Japan is extremely serious, especially because the government made such a decision without consulting the people.

Hirosawa of the Socialist Party Policy Deliberation Council said that the Socialist Party believes this issue is sufficient grounds to introduce a motion of no confidence in the government in the Diet. He said that the Socialist Party will present this issue to the people in a nationwide movement.

Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirohide Ishida confirmed today that the Japanese government had requested the United States to provide missiles and other new weapons. The US Department of Defense has already announced its agreement to supply these weapons.

Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 7th: Washington dispatch: The US Department of Defense revealed on the 6th that the United States will supply Japan with "certain non-classified equipment, including missiles." It is said that this is for Japan to conduct "military research and development."

Reports say that this equipment will include various types of missiles such as "Nike," "Sergeant," and "Honest John." The latter two can be equipped with atomic warheads.

    岸信介说不同意美在日驻原子部队
    社会党反对美国把导弹供给日本
    新华社8日讯　东京消息：日本临时代理首相岸信介今天在众议院预算委员会会议上答复反对党的质询的时候说：从国民感情和防御的观点来看，他同意不应该把原子武器运进日本。
    他说，如果美国表示要派原子机动部队驻在日本，日本要自主地决定态度。他说他认为日本政府无意答应这样的要求。
    岸信介在答复社会党议员和田博雄的质询的时候还表示，要争取废除日美“安全条约”。他说，目前日本内外两方面的情况都同签订“安全条约”和“行政协定”当时的情况不同。
    但是，岸信介又说，要修改和废除“安全条约”，首先必须逐渐增强自卫力量，并且需要得到美国的同意。他拒绝了社会党议员提出的给修改和废除“安全条约”规定一个期限的要求。
    社会党议员和田博雄今天就废除日美“安全条约”和把美国导弹运进日本等问题进行了质询。他不同意岸信介关于废除“安全条约”的说法，他认为要经过美国同意，就永远无法修改和废除。他还指责过去的内阁只将防卫计划拿给美国看，不给国会看。
    新华社7日讯　东京消息：日本社会党激烈反对美国把导弹供给日本。社会党书记长浅沼稻次郎今天说，关于把导弹供给日本的决定是极端严重的，尤其严重的是政府没有同人民商量就作出这样的决定。
    社会党政策审议会的广泽说，社会党认为这个问题足以在国会对政府提出不信任案。他说，社会党将在一次全国性的运动中向人民提出这个问题。
    日本内阁官房长官石田博英今天证实，日本政府曾经向美国要求提供导弹和其它新式武器。美国国防部已经宣布同意供给这些武器。
    新华社7日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国防部6日透露，美国将把“包括导弹在内的某些非机密性装备”供应日本。据说，这是让日本进行“军事研究和发展之用”。
    有消息说，这些装备中将包括“奈克”、“中士”和“诚实的约翰”等各式导弹。后面两种都可以装配原子弹头。
