Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, February 12th. Anshan Iron and Steel Company has formulated a plan to save more than 13 million yuan in raw materials this year. This plan was determined after Anshan Iron and Steel's material supply personnel explored potential in various aspects.

Last year, Anshan Iron and Steel's material supply personnel saved raw materials worth more than 14 million yuan for the country. This year, they have come up with dozens of new ways to save raw materials. They are expanding the waste oil regeneration station, so that this year they can recover about 600 tons of oil from waste engine oil after processing and filtering. Anshan Iron and Steel uses a large amount of copper every year. This year, Anshan Iron and Steel plans to further mobilize workers to recover hundreds of tons of scrap copper and waste copper tiles, which will be re-made into various materials after smelting and processing. In this way, it will no longer be necessary to apply to the state for good copper, and it will only be necessary to apply for some miscellaneous copper and copper tape and copper plate necessary for electrical and other projects. In the past, paper bags for magnesium sand were bought with foreign exchange. Anshan Iron and Steel has now begun to organize employees to recycle magnesium sand paper bags. Each paper bag can be reused with a processing fee of only three cents. At the same time, Anshan Iron and Steel is actively promoting the method of bulk magnesium sand, which is expected to save about 200,000 yuan in paper bag costs a year.

Anshan Iron and Steel's material supply personnel also plan to promote more than 80 advanced experiences this year. They plan to use more than 10,000 tons of steel ends and tails to manufacture various tools and spare parts for equipment maintenance, which can save the country 600,000 to 700,000 yuan in wealth. In the Dashiqiao Magnesite Mine, aluminum wire has been used to replace copper wire as detonating wire last year. If this experience is widely promoted in Dagushan, Dong'anshan, Yingtaoyuan and other iron mines this year, a large amount of copper wire can be saved. In addition, continuing to use the method of adding tailings powder to cement to save cement, and improving the utilization rate of coal slime to save good coal, will also save a lot of wealth for the country.

    鞍钢材料供应人员计划节约一千多万元
    新华社鞍山12日电　鞍山钢铁公司已经订出在今年内节约原材料一千三百多万元的计划，这是鞍钢的材料供应人员经过挖掘各方面潜力而后确定的。
    鞍钢的材料供应人员去年曾经为国家节约了价值一千四百多万元的原材料，今年他们又想出了几十种新办法来节约原材料。他们正在扩大废油再生站，这样，今年就可以从废机油中，经过加工滤清之后，回收六百吨左右的机油。鞍钢每年要用大量的铜，今年鞍钢准备进一步发动工人回收数百吨碎铜、废铜瓦等，经过熔炼加工之后再制成各种材料，这样就可以不再向国家申请好铜，只要申请补充一些杂铜和做电气等工程所必需的铜带、铜板就行了。装镁砂的纸袋过去都是用外汇买来的，鞍钢现在已经开始组织职工回收镁砂纸袋，每个纸袋只要用三角钱的加工费就可以再用，同时在鞍钢内部积极推广散装镁砂的办法，预计一年就能节约二十万元左右的纸袋费。
    鞍钢材料供应人员今年还准备推广八十多种先进经验。他们计划利用一万多吨钢材的头、尾来制造设备检修用的各种工具和备品，可以为国家节约六、七十万元的财富。在大石桥镁矿，去年已经使用了铝线代替铜线做导火线。如果今年在大孤山、东鞍山、樱桃园等铁矿广泛推广这项经验，就可以节约大量铜线。此外如继续利用在水泥中加尾矿粉的办法来节约水泥，提高煤泥的使用率以节省好煤等办法，也都将为国家节约很多财富。
