　　Xinhua News Agency, Mangya, 4th. In Qinghai Province's petroleum exploration work, demobilized soldiers have become a major force, powerfully supporting the petroleum exploration endeavor in the Qaidam Basin. The Mangya Drilling Department alone has received and settled nearly two thousand demobilized construction soldiers in the past year. Adding those transferred in previous years, by the end of last year, demobilized soldiers accounted for about 70% of the employees affiliated with the Qinghai Petroleum Exploration Bureau.

　　The vast majority of demobilized soldiers who have participated in petroleum exploration work over the years have been able to maintain the glorious traditions of the People's Liberation Army of diligence and bravery, and actively and assiduously study technology. For example, among the thousands of employees transferred to the Mangya Drilling Department last spring, about 80% already possessed the technical level of a third-grade worker, and some who studied well reached technical levels of fourth-grade or above. Due to the diligent work and assiduous study of the demobilized soldiers transferred to the enterprise, many of them have become production experts and advanced producers. For example, the drilling team led by Li Xueyao, the former deputy company commander of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, safely drilled a test well as deep as 3,000 meters in just ten months and was selected as the "Advanced Drilling Team" of 1956. Now, even without technical personnel present, he can independently handle technical problems. Jing Liancheng, an advanced producer in the Youdunzi exploration area and the director of the electromechanical workshop, was originally the chief of staff of a certain battalion of the People's Liberation Army. In the past, he was an outstanding combat hero, and now he is a production model. After he transferred to the enterprise, he served as the director of the workshop. In addition to leading the workers to do a good job in production, he can also conscientiously do the work of the Party branch secretary. He closely grasps the trade union and the Communist Youth League to do a good job in ideological work. As a result, in addition to completing the repair and assembly tasks of the exploration area on schedule, he has also undertaken a lot of repair and assembly tasks for fraternal units.

    青海省石油勘探工作中
    复员军人成为主要力量
    新华社茫崖4日电　在青海省的石油勘探工作中，复员军人成为一支主要的力量，他们有力地支援了柴达木盆地的石油勘探事业。仅茫崖钻井处一年来就接收和安置了近二千名复员建设军人，加上近年来历次转入的在内，到去年年底为止，青海石油勘探局所属职工中，转业军人约占70％。
    历年来参加石油勘探工作的转业军人绝大多数都能保持解放军勤劳勇敢的光荣传统，积极刻苦钻研技术，如去年春季转入茫崖钻井处的千多名职工中，80％左右已具有三级工的技术水平，部分学习好的达到了四级以上的技术水平。由于转入企业的复员军人的认真工作和刻苦钻研，他们中间有不少人已成了生产能手和先进生产者，如原解放军某部副连长李学尧领导的钻井队，仅以十个月的时间便安全地钻完了一口深达三千公尺的探井，当选为1956年的“先进钻井队”，现在，即使技术人员不在，他也能单独处理技术问题。油墩子探区的先进生产者、机电车间主任荆连成，原为解放军某营参谋长，过去他是出色的战斗英雄，现在他是生产模范，在他转到企业以后，担任车间主任，除了领导工人搞好生产以外，还能认真作好党支部书记的工作，他抓紧工会、青年团来搞好思想工作，结果除了按期完成探区的修配任务外，并且还给兄弟单位担负了不少的修配任务。
