Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 7th. Soviet authorities held a press conference on February 6th at the Central Journalist House in Moscow regarding the issue of US sabotage activities against the Soviet Union.

During the three-hour press conference, over two hundred Soviet and foreign journalists saw the confiscated exhibits displayed at the Central Journalist House, including various forged documents, firearms, radios, poisons, maps, codes, and other material evidence used by numerous US spies. They also heard the accounts of three US spies who surrendered and one who was arrested by the Soviet security agencies, detailing their experiences of being sent to the Soviet Union for espionage activities.

After the press conference began, Ilichev, the Director of the Information Department of the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who presided over the event, first delivered a statement to the journalists. He said that sending spies and saboteurs is a form of struggle adopted by the enemies of the Soviet Union to achieve their anti-people goals. In our time, the American aggressive bloc is the instigator and main organizer of the so-called "secret war" against the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, and against all independent and sovereign nations.

Historically, the United States was the first to elevate sabotage against countries it was "dissatisfied" with and gross interference in the internal affairs of other great and small nations to the level of national policy. The so-called "liberation policy" planned by American leaders, namely the destructive activities of the United States against socialist countries, has determined the US policy towards these countries for many years and is an integral part of American foreign policy.

It is well known that the US Congress has allocated hundreds of millions of dollars for sabotage activities. In 1951, the US Congress passed the so-called Carl Vinson Amendment to the "Mutual Security Act." It must be stated that both this law itself and the amendments to the law are a gross violation of the basic norms of international law and are, in fact, acts of aggression.

American government agencies are conducting subversive reconnaissance activities against peaceful countries. These forces operate under the guise of various "private" committees, foundations, and federations.

It can be seen from this that the unprecedented espionage and sabotage activities against socialist countries during peacetime and the gross interference in the internal affairs of sovereign countries have become the cornerstone of the official foreign policy of the United States.

Ilichev then asked the journalists to pay attention to the fact that the United States has been interfering in the internal affairs of the Soviet Union and various people's democracies for many years, and constantly violating Soviet airspace. He said that from April 1950 to December 1956, the United States had at least twelve aerial provocations against the Soviet Union.

Ilichev cited many specific examples to illustrate that American planes had repeatedly flown over the Soviet border and airdropped spies and saboteurs into the Soviet Union, and that American espionage agencies had also released reconnaissance balloons into Soviet airspace. Some American diplomatic personnel were also engaged in reconnaissance and espionage activities.

Robert Dillar, the military attaché of the US Embassy in the Soviet Union, was expelled for being caught red-handed engaging in espionage activities.

Ilichev said that all these facts prove that the United States is grossly interfering in the internal affairs of the Soviet Union, which is a violation of the United Nations Charter, and is unprecedented in the relationship between countries maintaining normal diplomatic relations.

Finally, Ilichev introduced to the journalists the US intelligence agents who were sent to the Soviet Union: Yakuta, Kudryavtsev, Novikov, and Khmilnitsky.

Yakuta and the others then respectively introduced to the journalists how they were recruited by the US intelligence agencies, how they received espionage training, and how they entered the Soviet Union. Yakuta, one of the four former spies, was captured by the German invaders after being wounded in the war against Germany. Kudryavtsev and Novikov were abducted to Germany by the Germans at the ages of eighteen and seventeen respectively. Khmilnitsky worked for the Germans during the German occupation and later fled from the Soviet Union to Germany. After arriving in West Germany, they were recruited by the US intelligence agencies, underwent specialized espionage training, and were then airdropped into Soviet territory. Among them, Yakuta and Kudryavtsev were airdropped into the Krasnodar Territory of the Soviet Union by a US plane on April 24, 1953, and their mission was to conduct espionage activities in the Moscow region. Novikov said that his mission after being airdropped into the Soviet Union was to send information about the Soviet Union to the US intelligence agencies, and to recruit degenerate elements among Soviet citizens to organize underground counter-revolutionary groups in order to carry out anti-Soviet subversive activities. After being airdropped into the Soviet Union, the above three people were moved by the construction achievements of the Soviet Union and the happy lives of the people, and voluntarily surrendered to the Soviet security agencies, and were therefore treated leniently.

Khmilnitsky was arrested by the Soviet security agencies. After he was airdropped into the Soviet Union, the US intelligence agencies instructed him to find suitable landing sites in the Bryansk Forest in the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic for the continued airdropping of new spies, weapons, and other equipment for espionage and sabotage activities against the Soviet Union. Khmilnitsky was also treated leniently by the relevant Soviet authorities because he confessed his crimes.

### 苏联外交部新闻司司长在记者招待会上发表声明  指责美国对苏联进行间谍活动的罪行  三名自首和一名被捕的美国间谍坦白犯罪经过

    苏联外交部新闻司司长在记者招待会上发表声明
    指责美国对苏联进行间谍活动的罪行
    三名自首和一名被捕的美国间谍坦白犯罪经过
    新华社莫斯科7日电　苏联有关方面2月6日在莫斯科中央新闻工作者之家就美国对苏联进行破坏活动的问题举行了记者招待会。
    在这一次长达三小时的记者招待会上，二百多名苏联和外国的记者看到了展览在中央新闻工作者之家的被缴获的许多美国间谍所用的各种大量伪造的证件、枪枝、电台、毒药、地图、密码等物证，并且听了三名自首和一名被苏联公安机关逮捕的美国间谍所作的关于他们被派入苏联进行间谍活动的经过。
    招待会开始后，主持招待会的苏联外交部新闻司司长伊利切夫首先向记者们发表了声明。他说，派遣间谍和破坏分子是苏联的敌人为了达到其反人民的目的而采取的一种斗争形式。在我们这个时代，美国侵略集团是反对苏联和其他社会主义国家、反对所有独立自主的国家的所谓“秘密战争”的策动者和主要组织者。
    在历史上，美国第一个把对它所“不满意”的国家进行破坏活动、粗暴地干涉其他大国和小国的内政，提高到国家政策的水平。美国领导人策划的所谓“解放政策”，即美国对社会主义国家进行的破坏活动，许多年来一直决定着美国对这些国家的路线，并且是美国外交政策的组成部分。
    大家知道，美国国会拨了好几亿美元用作破坏工作的经费。1951年美国国会通过了对“共同安全法”的所谓卡尔斯坦修正案。必须肯定地说，不论是这个法律本身还是对法律的修正，都是对国际法基本准则的粗暴破坏，实际是侵略行为。
    美国政府机构对和平国家进行着颠覆侦探活动。这些势力在五花八门的“私人”委员会、基金会、联合会的幌子下进行活动。
    由此可见，在和平时期对社会主义国家史无先例的间谍破坏活动、粗暴地干涉自主国的内政，已经成为美国官方对外政策的基石。
    伊利切夫接着要求记者们注意美国多年来干涉苏联和各人民民主国家的内政、不断侵犯苏联领空的事实。他说，从1950年4月到1956年12月这段时间内美国对苏联至少有过十二次空中挑衅。
    伊利切夫列举许多具体事例说明，美国飞机好几次飞越苏联国境，并且向苏联空投间谍和破坏分子，美国间谍机关还向苏联领空施放侦察性的汽球。一些美国外交人员也从事侦察和间谍活动。
    美国驻苏联大使馆武官罗伯特·德勒尔就是因为从事间谍活动当场破获而被驱逐出境的。
    伊利切夫说，所有这些事实证明：美国粗暴地干涉苏联的内政，这种活动是违反联合国宪章的，而且在维持正常外交关系的国家的相互关系中是没有先例的。
    最后，伊利切夫向记者们介绍了美国间谍机关派到苏联来的间谍亚库塔、库德里亚夫采夫、诺维科夫、赫米尔尼茨基。
    亚库塔等接着分别向记者们介绍了他们如何被美国间谍机关搜罗去、如何受间谍训练和进入苏联的经过。这四名前间谍人员亚库塔是在对德战争中受伤被德寇俘虏去的，库德里亚夫采夫和诺维科夫是在十八岁和十七岁时被德国人拐到德国去的，赫米尔尼茨基是在德寇占领期间替德国人工作后来从苏联逃到德国的。他们到西德以后，就被美国间谍机关所网罗，经过专门的间谍训练，然后分别被空投到苏联领土上来。其中，亚库塔和库德里亚夫采夫是在1953年4月24日被美国飞机空投到苏联克拉斯诺达边疆区的，他们的任务是在莫斯科区域进行间谍活动。诺维科夫说，他被空投到苏联的任务是向美国情报机关发有关苏联的情报，并且在苏联公民间网罗堕落分子组织地下反革命集团以便进行反苏颠覆活动。以上三个人在空投到苏联以后，由于被苏联的建设成就和人民的幸福生活所感动而自动向苏联保安机关自首，因而受到宽大待遇。
    赫米尔尼茨基是被苏联保安机关逮捕的。在他被空投入苏联以后，美国间谍机关曾经指示他在白俄罗斯共和国境内布利安斯克森林里寻找适宜于空降的地点，以便继续空投新的间谍、武器和其他对苏联进行间谍和破坏活动的装备。赫米尔尼茨基由于坦白了自己的罪行，也受到苏联有关方面的宽大处理。
