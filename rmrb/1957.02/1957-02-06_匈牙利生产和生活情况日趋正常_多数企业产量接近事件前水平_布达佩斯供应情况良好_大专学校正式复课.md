Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, February 5th. Production and living conditions throughout Hungary are increasingly returning to normal.

    At present, the production volume of the vast majority of industrial enterprises in the country has approached the level of September of last year. These include large enterprises such as the Diósgyőr Lenin Metallurgical Works and the Győr Vehicle Manufacturing Plant. The Csepel Iron and Steel Works has already started working three shifts a day. The largest Little Pest Clothing Sewing Factory in Hungary has fully resumed operations.

    Regarding the food supply for residents, according to "People's Free Press," the supply situation in Budapest is currently much better than in the same period last year. Because housewives have stored enough food, the purchase volume of flour, sugar, fat, ham, sausage, etc. has decreased by 20% to 40% compared to the same period last year. Budapest currently has 320 carloads of vegetables in storage. The supply of eggs has also greatly improved.

    Cultural life is also becoming richer and more colorful. Currently, more than 90% of cinemas in Budapest have reopened. In these cinemas, in addition to showing domestic films, they also show films from the Soviet Union and other countries. Many theaters and concert halls in Budapest have already begun daily performances. With the curfew time postponed from 11:00 PM to 12:00 AM, the theater performance time has also been postponed by one hour, that is, performances begin at 6:00 PM in the evening.

    Many universities and colleges in Budapest officially resumed classes on February 4th, and the number of students who have returned to school accounts for 80% of the total number of university students. Before resuming classes, all schools did a lot of preparation work, such as formulating new teaching plans and adjusting certain courses. According to the new teaching plan, the Karl Marx University of Economics is preparing to complete two semesters of courses this semester to make up for the missed classes since the October incident last year. Most of the other institutions of higher learning in the states have already resumed classes in mid-January this year.

    匈牙利生产和生活情况日趋正常
    多数企业产量接近事件前水平
    布达佩斯供应情况良好　大专学校正式复课
    据新华社布达佩斯5日电　匈牙利全国的生产和生活情况日益趋向正常。
    目前，全国绝大多数工业企业的生产量已经接近去年9月份的水平。其中包括迪奥日吉厄尔列宁冶金联合厂、吉厄尔车辆制造厂等大型企业。切佩尔钢铁联合厂已经开始每天三班工作。匈牙利最大的小佩斯服装缝纫工厂已经全部开工。
    在居民的食品供应方面，据“人民自由报”报道，目前布达佩斯的供应情况比去年同一时期好得多。由于家庭主妇们都贮藏了足够的食物，因而对面粉、食糖、脂肪、火腿、腊肠等的购买量比去年同时期减少了20％到40％。布达佩斯目前贮藏有三百二十车皮的蔬菜。蛋类的供应同样大有改善。
    文化生活也越来越丰富多采。目前在布达佩斯已经有90％以上的电影院恢复营业。在这些电影院里，除了放映本国影片外，还放映苏联和其他国家的影片。布达佩斯的许多剧院和音乐厅已经开始每天演出。随着戒严时间从二十三点推迟到二十四点，剧院演出时间也推迟了一小时，即在晚上六时开始演出。
    布达佩斯的许多大专学校已经在2月4日正式恢复上课，复课的学生人数占大学生总数的80％。在开始恢复上课前，各学校都做了许多准备工作，如拟定新的教学计划，调整某些课程等。卡尔·马克思经济大学根据新的教学计划准备在这学期内教完两学期的课程，以弥补去年十月事件以来的缺课。其他各州的高等学校大部分都已经在今年1月中旬复课。
