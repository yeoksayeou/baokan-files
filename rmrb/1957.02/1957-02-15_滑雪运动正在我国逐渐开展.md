Xinhua News Agency, Tonghua, February 14th (Xinhua News Agency reporter Li Detian): On the eve of the opening of the 1957 National Skiing Competition, the person in charge of the competition told our reporter: Although skiing is still a relatively new sport in China, it is now gradually developing in Northeast and Northwest China. Especially in some areas of Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces, it has become a mass sport.

　　In recent years, after winter, the ski resorts in Jilin and Tonghua cities in Jilin Province have attracted many ski enthusiasts every day. Many young people often make their own skis to practice skiing; even many young children like to sit on sleds and slide down the slopes.

　　The national skiing competition, which will begin here on the 15th, is the first of its kind in China. Through this competition, we can review the achievements of skiing in our country, and at the same time, ski enthusiasts from all over the country can learn from each other in the competition, exchange experience, and improve the technical level of skiing more quickly. At present, because the technical level of our country's skiers is not high, this competition only includes men's and women's speed skiing (men's five kilometers, ten kilometers, and twenty kilometers, women's one kilometer, three kilometers, and five kilometers), slalom skiing, and downhill skiing. High-level events such as ski jumping and giant slalom skiing held in international skiing competitions have not been included in this competition, but will be developed in the future.

　　The person in charge of the competition said: Skiing is a good winter outdoor sport. It can enhance the physical fitness of people participating in this sport, especially the cold resistance and endurance. Because this sport is mostly carried out in the mountains, athletes must persist in going up and down the mountains, which can also cultivate their courage and perseverance. After the end of this competition, we plan to carry out some work to green the mountain tops at the Tonghua Ski Resort, so that it will become a beautiful ski station, so that ski enthusiasts from areas without skiing conditions can use their holidays to come here and taste the fun of skiing.

    滑雪运动正在我国逐渐开展
    新华社通化14日电　新华社记者李德天报道：在1957年全国滑雪运动会开幕前夕，运动会负责人对本社记者说：滑雪在中国虽然还是一个比较新的运动项目，但是目前它已经在我国东北和西北各地逐渐开展起来。特别是在吉林、黑龙江两省的一些地区，它已经成为群众性的体育运动了。
    这几年入冬以后，吉林省的吉林和通化二市的滑雪场，每天都吸引了许多滑雪爱好者。许多青少年常常自制滑雪板练习滑雪；就连许多幼年儿童也喜欢坐着雪橇从山坡上滑下来。
    将从15日开始在这里举行的全国性的滑雪比赛，在中国来说还是第一次举行。通过这次运动会可以检阅我国滑雪运动的成就，同时也可以使各地滑雪运动爱好者在比赛中互相学习，交流经验，使滑雪技术水平更快地提高。目前由于我国滑雪运动员的技术水平还不高，所以这次运动会只举行男子和女子速度滑雪（男子有五公里、十公里和二十公里，女子有一公里、三公里和五公里）、回旋障碍滑雪和快速降下滑雪等项比赛。在国际滑雪比赛中举行的跳台跳雪和大回旋滑雪等技术水平比较高的项目，没有列为这次运动会的比赛项目，以后将要开展。
    运动会负责人说：滑雪运动是一项良好的冬季户外运动。它可以使参加这项运动的人体质增强，特别是增强耐寒力和耐久力。由于这项运动多在山中进行，运动员必须坚持上山、下山，这也可以培养他们的勇敢和坚毅精神。在这次运动会结束以后，准备在通化滑雪场进行一些绿化山头的工作，使它成为一个美丽的滑雪站，让没有滑雪条件地区的滑雪爱好者，能够利用假期来到这里尝尝滑雪的滋味。（附图片）
