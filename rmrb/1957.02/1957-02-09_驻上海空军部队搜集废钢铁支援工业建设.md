Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, February 6th. Air Force units stationed in Shanghai have unearthed 100 tons of scrap steel from the airport grounds in the past month to support industrial construction.

This scrap steel was left over from the Japanese aggressors and the Kuomintang rule. In the past five years, the air force officers and soldiers have collected nearly a thousand tons of scrap steel on the airport to support industrial production. Since January 7 this year, the air force units have organized 32 youth thrift teams to continue searching for scrap steel underground at the airport. The officers and soldiers enthusiastically launched a competition. Whenever a piece of iron edge or an iron corner exposed on the ground was discovered, many officers and soldiers rushed to dig out scrap steel such as oil drums and iron plates underneath these targets. Officers and soldiers of a certain unit also dug up a large number of steel bars from the underground two or three feet deep. Soldiers Yu Guitian and Sun Jingren took off their cotton coats in the severe cold and dived into the riverbed, dragging out more than a dozen iron buckets.

    驻上海空军部队搜集废钢铁支援工业建设
    新华社上海6日电　驻上海空军部队最近一个月内，在机场地下挖出废钢铁一百吨。
    这些废钢铁，是过去日本侵略者和国民党统治时期遗留下来的。空军部队官兵在过去五年内已经在机场上搜集近千吨的废钢铁，支援工业生产。今年1月7日起，空军部队又组织三十二个青年节约队，继续向机场地下搜索废钢铁。官兵们热烈展开竞赛，每当露在地面上的一条铁边或是一个铁角被发现，立即有许多官兵赶来，在这些目标下面挖出油桶、铁板等废钢铁。某部官兵还从两三尺深的地下挖出大批钢筋。战士俞规田、孙镜仁在严寒中脱掉棉衣，潜入河底，拖出了十几只铁桶。
