Comrade Dimitrov once said to his people in December 1943: "Just as sunshine and air are necessary for living beings, loyal friendship with the Soviet Union is essential for Bulgaria's national independence and prosperity."

In the hearts of the Bulgarian people, Soviet-Bulgarian friendship can be traced back nearly eighty years. During the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-1878, the Russian army liberated Bulgaria from the five-hundred-year feudal rule of the Turkish Ottoman Empire. Even now, in many places in Bulgaria, monuments to Russian friendship are erected.

Bulgarians and Russians are Slavic peoples, and their languages are Slavic. Now, the fraternal friendship between the two peoples is being further developed and consolidated under the banner of proletarian internationalism due to common goals and ideals.

The Great October Revolution was a tremendous inspiration to the Bulgarian people. Although the Bulgarian people's uprising against the royalist bourgeoisie in September 1923 failed, the achievements and example of the Soviet Union in building socialism continued to inspire the Bulgarian people. After the outbreak of World War II, in December 1940, the Soviet Union proposed the signing of a Soviet-Bulgarian treaty of friendship, cooperation, and mutual assistance, which was a major support for Bulgaria to ensure its avoidance of enslavement by Hitler's fascism and to guarantee national independence. However, the Bulgarian royalist fascist ruling group rejected this friendly proposal. The people, however, persisted in an unyielding struggle for national independence and Soviet-Bulgarian friendship. In March 1941, the Bulgarian ruling group joined the Axis Powers Pact. On June 22, 1941, German fascism launched a barbaric war of aggression against the Soviet Union. The Bulgarian fascist accomplices did not send troops to directly fight against the Soviet Union because they did not receive the support of the people and soldiers. In early September 1944, the Soviet army victoriously marched into Bulgaria, directly helping the Bulgarian people to successfully revolt on September 9, 1944, transferring power to the people, establishing the Fatherland Front government, turning Bulgaria to the side of the Allies, and participating in the Third Ukrainian Front against fascist Germany under the command of the Soviet High Command. The Bulgarian people, with the help of the Soviet Union, saved their motherland.

After the war, the Bulgarian Fatherland Front government adopted a foreign policy of firmly uniting with the Soviet Union in friendship and developing friendship with all other countries.

U.S. and British imperialists once attempted to interfere in Bulgaria's internal affairs by threatening to refuse to sign a peace treaty, and later used the signing of the treaty as a tool to re-enslave the Bulgarian people, attempting to seize its territory and oppress the Bulgarian people with the burden of excessive reparations. But the Soviet Union has consistently supported the Bulgarian people. At the Moscow Soviet, American, and British Foreign Ministers Conference in December 1945 and the Paris Peace Conference that began in May 1946, the Soviet Union fought for a just peace treaty. Molotov said in his speech at the peace conference (October 14, 1946), "Bulgarians, you can rest assured that your borders will never change."

Due to the friendly support of the Soviet Union, the Allied Treaty with Bulgaria (signed on February 10, 1947) stipulated that Bulgaria's borders would remain unchanged in 1941 (i.e., the pre-war state), and reparations would be reduced from 98.5 million US dollars to 70 million US dollars. Thanks to the support of the Soviet Union, Bulgaria did not repeat the extremely difficult position it was in after the First World War, ensuring territorial integrity, national independence, and national sovereignty, consolidating its international position, and establishing normal diplomatic relations with neighboring countries and other countries, especially establishing close ties with other fraternal countries in Eastern Europe.

The Soviet-Bulgarian Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance signed on March 18, 1948, is an important symbol of the development of Soviet-Bulgarian friendship. The main purpose of the treaty is to jointly prevent the resurgence of German aggression, ensure European peace, and safeguard the common security of the two countries. On October 23, 1954, Western countries headed by the United States signed the Paris Agreement, openly attempting to revive West German militarism. In order to prevent West German militarist aggression and ensure European collective security, Bulgaria participated in the signing of the Soviet Union and other eight countries' Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance (i.e., the "Warsaw Treaty") on May 14, 1955.

The development and consolidation of Soviet-Bulgarian friendship is not only a guarantee of Bulgaria's national independence and socialist economic prosperity, but also a major factor in the unity of the socialist camp. The Bulgarian National Assembly has the ancient Bulgarian motto engraved on the lintel of the gate – "Unity is strength." At a time when imperialists are plotting to undermine the unity of socialist camp countries, the Bulgarian people are even more aware of the great significance of proletarian internationalist solidarity.

Economic cooperation and mutual assistance between Bulgaria and the Soviet Union is an important aspect of Soviet-Bulgarian friendly relations. In the early days after the end of the war, Bulgaria received selfless and substantial material assistance from the Soviet Union. The losses suffered by Bulgaria during the war under fascist rule were enormous. Hitler's fascists plundered huge material wealth worth 75 billion leva from Bulgaria. Therefore, the urgent task of the Fatherland Front government after the war was to eliminate the wounds of war and restore the national economy. In early 1945, Bulgaria signed its first trade agreement with the Soviet Union. In the first few years after the war, the Soviet Union supplied Bulgaria with 33,000 tons of cotton and other textile raw materials, 329,000 tons of petroleum and petroleum products, 217,000 tons of metals and metal products, and so on. During the years of continuous drought in Bulgaria from 1945 to 1948, the Soviet Union supplied another 365,000 tons of wheat and feed. This assistance from the Soviet Union helped the Bulgarian people restore industrial production and economic life. The assistance provided by the Soviet Union in finance, economy, and science and technology enabled Bulgaria to quickly restore its national economy and prepare conditions for socialist construction. In 1947-1948, Bulgaria completed the two-year plan, and industrial production exceeded the pre-war level of 1939 by more than 70%.

In contrast, imperialists have consistently adopted discriminatory and hostile policies toward people's democratic countries in trade relations. In the winter of 1948, just as the Bulgarian people were beginning to prepare their first five-year plan for the development of the national economy (1949-1953), U.S. imperialists took measures to effectively prohibit the export of industrial equipment and other goods to Bulgaria and other people's democratic countries. Later, the United States announced the abolition of the 1932 Provisional Trade Agreement between Bulgaria and the United States. The U.S. imperialist bloc also forced those capitalist countries that accepted "U.S. aid" to follow it in implementing embargoes, effectively severing normal trade relations with Bulgaria.

This vicious conspiracy of the imperialists also ended in bankruptcy. With their heroic labor, the Bulgarian people completed the first five-year plan ahead of schedule in 1952. Industrial production in 1952 greatly exceeded the pre-war level, being 4.3 times that of 1939. The proportion of industrial and agricultural production has also undergone tremendous changes. Now the Bulgarian people are working hard to complete the second five-year plan (1953-1957). In 1956, industrial output was already equal to six times that of 1939. From the first five-year plan to the beginning of the second five-year plan, in a period of about seven to eight years, the progress and achievements of the national economy exceeded the progress of the entire seventy years of Bulgarian capitalist development after 1877-1878.

The completion of the first five-year plan and the progress of the second five-year plan are inseparable from the Soviet Union's multifaceted assistance. The Soviet Union's economic assistance is an important factor in Bulgaria's socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of agriculture. Half of the goods imported from the Soviet Union are machinery and industrial equipment. Many of Bulgaria's metal mining industries (lead, zinc, copper, etc.) and chemical industry sectors were established with the cooperation and assistance of the Soviet Union. Soviet technical assistance has been decisive for Bulgaria not only in industrial technological transformation but also in agricultural technological transformation. For example, in 1955, Bulgaria had 19,411 tractors, of which 14,541, or 74.9%, were imported from the Soviet Union. As a result of agricultural mechanization, the labor force of 500,000 people was transferred from agriculture to industry and construction. The important industrial raw materials and other materials imported from the Soviet Union are of great significance to Bulgaria's industrial development and people's lives. For example, before the war in 1939, Bulgaria imported 4,869 tons of pig iron from abroad, but in 1955 it imported 70,000 tons, which is equal to 14.4 times that of 1939, almost all of which was supplied by the Soviet Union.

Bulgaria's exports to the Soviet Union are also of great significance in Soviet-Bulgarian economic relations. The Soviet Union is a vast market for Bulgaria's vegetables and other agricultural products. Tobacco accounts for 16%-18% of Bulgaria's total exports, and the Soviet Union purchases 64% of its total exports. In addition, Bulgaria also exports a large amount of mineral sand to the Soviet Union. In 1955, about 80% of Bulgaria's exported mineral sand was exported to the Soviet Union.

The Soviet Union not only supplies various machines and equipment but also provides loans to Bulgaria on preferential terms. According to Bulgaria's "Workers' Cause" newspaper, from 1949 to 1956, the Soviet Union loaned Bulgaria a total of 4.971 billion leva, and will provide another 1.974 billion leva during the period from 1957 to 1960 (excluding the figures agreed upon on January 12 this year).

Operating joint-stock companies has also been an important form of Soviet-Bulgarian economic cooperation. The Soviet-Bulgarian Mining Company, the Soviet-Bulgarian Shipbuilding Company, the Soviet-Bulgarian Construction Company, and the Soviet-Bulgarian Civil Aviation Company, which were established with the equipment supplied and technical assistance provided by the Soviet Union, have played a major role in promoting Bulgaria's national economic and technological development. In 1954, the Soviet Union had already transferred these enterprises to Bulgaria. In addition, the Soviet Union also provides technical and scientific assistance to Bulgaria, such as providing various technical design documents and patent rights, sending Soviet experts to help train cadres, or accepting Bulgarian experts, workers, and scientific workers to study and research in the Soviet Union.

On January 12 this year, the Soviet-Bulgarian 1957 barter agreement was signed in Sofia, stipulating that the Soviet Union would supply Bulgaria with industrial equipment, cotton, and other goods, and Bulgaria would supply the Soviet Union with non-ferrous metal ore, tobacco, and so on. At the same time, an agreement was reached that the Soviet Union would supply Bulgaria with wheat in the form of loans on preferential terms, which would be repaid in three years starting from this year's harvest season.

Soviet-Bulgarian friendship is a long-standing and unbreakable fraternal friendship. It is a strong link in the unity of the socialist camp. Based on their own experience, the Bulgarian people deeply understand and remember the teachings of Comrade Dimitrov. They regard maintaining friendship with the Soviet Union and upholding proletarian internationalism as their highest international obligation, and constantly consolidate and strengthen their unity and cooperation with the Soviet Union and the peoples of socialist countries.

    苏保友好合作日益巩固和发展
    隆仲
    季米特洛夫同志曾在1943年12月对自己的人民说过：“就像阳光和空气对于生物一样，对苏联忠诚的友谊对于保加利亚的民族独立和繁荣是必需的。”
    在保加利亚人民的心目中，保苏友谊一直可以追溯到近八十年以前。在1877—1878年的俄土战争期间，俄国军队曾把保加利亚从土耳其奥斯曼帝国五百年之久的封建统治之下解放出来。直到现在，保加利亚的许多地方，还竖立着对俄罗斯友谊的纪念碑。
    保加利亚人和俄罗斯人是斯拉夫民族，两者的语言都是斯拉夫语。现在，两国人民的兄弟友谊，由于共同的目的和理想，正在无产阶级国际主义的旗帜下进一步发展和巩固起来。
    伟大的十月革命对于保加利亚人民曾经是极大的鼓舞。1923年9月保加利亚人民反对保皇资产阶级的起义虽然失败了，但是苏联建设社会主义的成就和榜样仍然不断地鼓舞着保加利亚人民。第二次大战爆发后，1940年12月苏联建议签订苏保友好、互助条约，这对于保加利亚保证避免希特勒法西斯的奴役，保证民族独立是一个重大的支持，但是保加利亚保皇法西斯统治集团拒绝了这个友好的建议。而人民却为民族的独立和保苏友谊坚持了不屈不挠的斗争。1941年3月保加利亚统治集团参加了轴心国家公约。1941年6月22日德国法西斯对苏联发动了野蛮的侵略战争。保加利亚的法西斯帮凶由于得不到人民和兵士的支持，才没有派出军队直接对苏联作战。苏联军队于1944年9月初胜利进军保加利亚，直接帮助了保加利亚人民于1944年9月9日胜利起义，使政权转移到人民手里，成立了祖国阵线政府，使保加利亚转到同盟国方面，并在苏军统帅部指挥下参加乌克兰第三战线对法西斯德国作战。保加利亚人民在苏联的帮助下拯救了自己的祖国。
    战后，保加利亚祖国阵线政府采取了坚决同苏联团结友好、并发展同其他一切国家友好的外交方针。
    美、英帝国主义者曾经以拒绝签订和约的威胁，企图干涉保加利亚内政，后来又利用和约的签订来作为重新奴役保加利亚人民的工具，企图割取她的领土，并以过分的赔款的重担来压榨保加利亚人民。但苏联却一贯支持保加利亚人民，在1945年12月莫斯科苏、美、英三国外长会议上和1946年5月开始的巴黎和会上，苏联为公正的和平条约进行了斗争。莫洛托夫在和会的演说中（1946年10月14日）说，“保加利亚人呵，你们尽可放心，你们的疆界是始终不会变移的。”
    由于苏联的友好支持，同盟国对保加利亚和约（于1947年2月10日签字）规定了保加利亚国界保持1941年状态不变（即战前状态），赔款从九万八千五百万美元减低到七千万美元。由于苏联的支援，保加利亚就没有重复它在第一次大战后所处的异常艰难的地位，保证了领土完整、民族独立和国家主权，巩固了它的国际地位，同邻国和其它国家建立了正常的外交关系，尤其同东欧其他兄弟国家建立了密切的联系。
    1948年3月18日签订的苏保友好、合作、互助条约是保苏友谊发展的重要标志。条约的主要目的是共同防止德国侵略的再起，保障欧洲和平和维护两国的共同安全。1954年10月23日以美国为首的西方国家签订了巴黎协定，公开企图复活西德军国主义。为了防止西德军国主义侵略、保障欧洲集体安全，保加利亚于1955年5月14日参加签订了苏联等八国友好、合作、互助条约（即“华沙条约”）。
    苏保友谊的发展与巩固，不仅是保加利亚民族独立与社会主义经济繁荣的保证，也是社会主义阵营团结的重大因素之一。保加利亚国民议会在大门的门坊上刻着古老的保加利亚格言——“团结就是力量”。在帝国主义阴谋破坏社会主义阵营各国的团结的时候，保加利亚人民更体验到无产阶级国际主义团结的伟大意义。
    保加利亚同苏联的经济合作和互助是保苏友好关系的一个重要的方面。还在战争结束后的初期，保加利亚就从苏联获得了无私的、大量的物质援助。保加利亚在法西斯统治的战争时期所受到的损失是极大的，希特勒法西斯从保加利亚掠走了价值七百五十亿列弗的巨大物质财富。因此，战后祖国阵线政府的迫切任务就是消除战争创伤，恢复国民经济。1945年初，保加利亚同苏联签订了第一个贸易协定。战后最初几年苏联对保加利亚供应了三万三千吨棉花和别的纺织原料，三十二万九千吨石油和石油产品，二十一万七千吨金属和金属制品，等等。在1945到1948年保加利亚连年旱灾的期间，苏联又供应了三十六万五千吨小麦和饲料。苏联的这些援助帮助保加利亚人民恢复了工业生产和经济生活。苏联在财政经济和科学技术方面所提供的援助，使保加利亚能够迅速恢复国民经济，并为社会主义建设准备好条件。1947—1948年保加利亚完成了两年计划，工业生产比战前1939年的水平超过了70％。
    与此相反，帝国主义者对人民民主国家在贸易关系上一贯采取歧视和敌视的政策。1948年冬，正当保加利亚人民开始准备自己的发展国民经济的第一个五年计划（1949—1953）的时候，美帝国主义者采取了措施，实际上禁止对保加利亚和别的人民民主国家输出工业设备和其它货物。后来美国又宣布废止1932年的保美临时贸易协定。美帝国主义集团并且强使那些接受“美援”的资本主义国家追随它实施禁运，事实上断绝了同保加利亚的正常的贸易关系。
    帝国主义者的这个恶毒的阴谋也只落得了一个破产的下场。保加利亚人民以自己的英雄劳动，于1952年提前完成了第一个五年计划，1952年工业生产大大超过了战前，为1939年的四点三倍。工业与农业生产的比重也发生巨大的改变。现在保加利亚人民正为完成第二个五年计划（1953年—1957）而努力。1956年工业产量已经等于1939年的六倍。从第一个五年计划到第二个五年计划开始，在大约七—八年多的时间内，国民经济的进展和成就超过了1877—1878年之后保加利亚资本主义发展整整七十年时间的进展。
    第一个五年计划的完成和第二个五年计划的进展，是跟苏联的多方面援助分不开的。苏联的经济援助是保加利亚实行社会主义工业化和农业社会主义改造的一个重要因素。在从苏联进口的货物中，有一半是机器和工业设备。保加利亚的许多金属采矿业（铅、锌、铜等）和化学工业部门都是由于苏联的合作和帮助而建立起来的。苏联的技术援助对保加利亚不但在工业技术改造方面，而且在农业技术改造方面都具有决定性的意义。例如，1955年保加利亚拥有拖拉机一万九千四百一十一台，其中一万四千五百四十一台、即74.9％是从苏联输入的。农业机械化的结果，使五十万人的劳动力从农业转入了工业和建筑业。从苏联进口的重要工业原料和其它的物资对于保加利亚工业发展与人民生活都具有重大的意义。例如战前1939年保加利亚从国外输入了生铁四千八百六十九吨，1955年就输入了七万吨，等于1939年十四点四倍，几乎全部是苏联供应的。
    保加利亚对苏联的输出，在保苏经济关系上也有很重要的意义。苏联是保加利亚的蔬菜和别的农产品的广大市场。烟草在保加利亚出口总额中占16％—18％，而苏联购买了它全部输出的64％。另外，保加利亚也向苏联输出大量矿砂。1955年保加利亚出口的矿砂有80％左右是输出到苏联去的。
    苏联不仅供应各种机器和设备，而且还以优惠的条件向保加利亚提供贷款。据保加利亚“工人事业报”报道，从1949到1956年，苏联贷给保加利亚的款项共计四十九点七一亿列弗，在1957到1960年期间还将提供一十九点七四亿列弗（其中不包括今年1月12日协议的数字）。
    经营合股公司也曾经是苏保经济合作的一种重要形式。在苏联供应装备和提供技术援助下建立起来的保苏矿业公司、保苏造船公司、保苏建筑公司、保苏民航公司等企业在促进保加利亚国民经济和技术发展上曾经起过重大的作用。在1954年，苏联已经把这些企业移交给了保加利亚。此外，苏联还对保加利亚提供技术科学援助，如供给各种技术设计文件和专利权，派遣苏联专家帮助培养干部，或接受保加利亚专家、工人和科学工作者到苏联去学习和研究。
    今年1月12日在索非亚签订了保苏1957年换货协定，规定苏联供应保加利亚工业设备、棉花等等货物，保加利亚将供应苏联有色金属矿砂、烟草等等。同时达成了一项协议，苏联将以贷款形式按优惠条件向保加利亚供应小麦，这笔贷款从今年收获季节开始分三年偿还。
    苏保友谊是历史悠久的、牢不可破的兄弟友谊。它是社会主义阵营各国团结的坚强的一环。保加利亚人民根据切身的经验，深深地懂得和铭记着季米特洛夫同志的教导。他们把维护对苏联的友谊和维护无产阶级国际主义作为自己最高的国际义务，不断地巩固和加强同苏联和社会主义各国人民的团结和合作。
