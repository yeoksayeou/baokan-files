　　Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, February 14th: Egypt's "Al-Masaa" newspaper published a commentary on the 13th regarding the Soviet proposals for ensuring peace in the Middle East, stating that the proposal would "free the region from imperialist influence and reunite the Arabs."

　　The newspaper said that the fundamental purpose of the Soviet proposal is to: free the Middle East from the Cold War and hot wars, withdraw foreign military blocs and foreign military bases to maintain the unity of the region, and improve the region's economy and living standards through foreign cooperation, without attaching any political or military conditions.

　　It said: "Russia does not demand the establishment of military bases in this region. On the contrary, it calls for the abolition of foreign military alliances and insists on implementing a 'non-interference' policy."

　　The newspaper also pointed out: "If this region is not affected by imperialism, unity will become a characteristic of the Middle East." It said: "This unity has undoubtedly been undermined. This is due to the conclusion of the Baghdad Pact; the attempts by major powers to drag some Arab countries into the Baghdad Pact, and the attempts by imperialist countries to obtain bases or renew existing bases in Arab countries."

　　On the 13th, "Al-Shaab" newspaper used "Soviet Proposals for Solving the Middle East Problem" as a large headline on the front page and published Shepilov's report on the international situation and Soviet foreign policy on the entire page.

　　The newspaper said: "Peaceful coexistence is the cornerstone of Soviet policy." It emphasized Shepilov's statement that economic cooperation with Middle Eastern countries should not be subject to any political or military conditions. The newspaper wrote: "Egypt and the people of other Middle Eastern countries oppose the Cold War and any form of foreign interference. The people of the Middle East support constructive efforts to ease international tensions, resolve outstanding issues, and create conditions for genuine cooperation." The newspaper welcomed Shepilov's proposal for convening a world economic conference.

　　The "Al-Ahram" newspaper on the 13th pointed out that the Soviet-proposed "plan will guarantee the security of all countries in the region."

　　The "Al-Gomhuria" newspaper published a detailed summary of Shepilov's report under the title "Russia Demands that Major Powers Not Interfere in the Internal Affairs of Middle Eastern Countries." The newspaper emphasized that peaceful coexistence is the only way to defend peace.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, February 14th, according to TASS: "Al-Nasr" newspaper said that the Soviet proposals to the United States, Britain, and France regarding peace and security in the Middle East are a test of the United States' sincerity.

　　The newspaper emphasized that if the United States rejects the Soviet proposal, then "the United States' rejection will make the Arabs more convinced that the United States harbors ambitions towards Arab countries and that the Eisenhower Doctrine is dangerous."

　　"Al-Nour" newspaper said that the six clear principles proposed by the Soviet Union for establishing peace in the Middle East are based on respecting the sovereignty of Arab countries and non-interference in their internal affairs.

　　In an editorial commenting on Soviet Foreign Minister Shepilov's foreign policy report, the newspaper gave a high evaluation to the Soviet government's proposals. The newspaper emphasized that these proposals "fully comply with the policy of peaceful coexistence."

　　The newspaper also said that the principles elucidated in Shepilov's report fully comply with the wishes of the Arabs. The Soviet Union once again supports the people of Arab countries and their national aspirations, and strikes at the imperialist conspiracies and intrigues against Arab countries in the form of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" or under other names.

　　Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, February 14th: The six basic principles of the Soviet proposal for a joint declaration on peace and security in the Near and Middle East to be announced by the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France were the focus of attention of Indian newspapers on the 13th. All newspapers prominently published detailed summaries of the report of Soviet Foreign Minister Shepilov at the Supreme Soviet meeting on the front page with large headlines.

　　According to the Press Trust of India, Delhi news, the six principles proposed by the Soviet Union to ensure peace in West Asia were welcomed by people in Delhi. The news agency said that observers in Delhi believe that the new Soviet proposals seem to arouse strong interest among Arab countries, especially those that have not participated in military treaties.

　　It also said that observers were pleased to note that the Soviet Foreign Minister emphasized that declaring the policy of "peaceful coexistence" – one of the Panchsheel principles – is the cornerstone of Soviet foreign policy; and called for abandoning the idea of dragging West Asian countries into military blocs.

　　The "Hindustan Standard" published an editorial welcoming the Soviet proposal, saying that the proposal "is infinitely higher than the Eisenhower Doctrine, which carries the crude odor of a military savior, in terms of reasonableness, durability, morality, and peace."

　　The newspaper pointed out, "The basis for proposing the Eisenhower Doctrine is precisely the kind of fear and rhetoric that the Soviet plan advocates to eliminate." It went on to say: "However, it would be short-sighted to reduce the significance of Shepilov's proposal to merely a propaganda offensive against the Eisenhower Doctrine." The newspaper called on the United States to welcome the Soviet plan and study the various opportunities presented by the plan. "This is in line with the highest interests of the people of the Middle East and world peace."

　　The "Indian Express" wrote: "Shepilov has laid a solid foundation for the complete neutrality of this region. If this foundation is accepted, any foreign interference will become completely unjustified, while not affecting the provision of urgently needed economic assistance in a fair and impartial manner."

　　The "Times of India" reported that Delhi's reaction to the Soviet six-point plan for West Asia was that the Soviet plan was "in line with India's thinking." The newspaper's report also said that Shepilov's speech aroused great interest among people in Delhi.

    苏联建议符合中东人民最高利益
    埃及叙利亚印度等国报纸欢迎苏联照会
    新华社开罗14日电　埃及的“晚报”13日就苏联关于保证中东和平的建议发表评论说，这个建议将“使这个地区摆脱帝国主义影响并且将使阿拉伯人重新团结”。
    这家报纸说，苏联的建议的基本目的在于：使中东摆脱冷战和热战，撤销外国军事集团和外国军事基地以维护这个地区的团结，通过外国的合作来提高这个地区的经济和生活水平，这种合作不得附带任何政治或者军事条件。
    它说：“俄国并没有要求在这个地区建立军事基地，相反，它要求废除外国军事联盟，并且坚持实行‘不干涉’政策。”
    这家报纸还指出：“如果这个地区不受到帝国主义影响，团结一致就会成为中东的特征。”它说：“这种团结毫无疑问被破坏了。这是由于缔结巴格达条约；大国设法把一些阿拉伯国家拉进巴格达条约以及帝国主义国家设法在阿拉伯国家取得基地或续租已有的基地。”
    “人民报”13日在第一版以“苏联关于解决中东问题的建议”作为大字标题，用整版刊载了谢皮洛夫关于国际局势和苏联外交政策的报告。
    这家报纸说：“和平共处是苏联政策的基石”。它强调指出谢皮洛夫所讲的这句话，同中东国家的经济合作应当不附带任何政治或军事条件。报纸写道：“埃及和中东其他国家人民反对冷战，反对任何形式的外国干涉。中东各国人民都支持为缓和国际紧张局势、解决悬而未决的问题和为创造真正合作的条件所作的建设性的努力。”这家报纸欢迎谢皮洛夫提出的关于召开世界经济会议的主张。
    13日的“金字塔报”指出，苏联提出的“计划将能保证这个地区的各国安全”。
    “共和国报”以“俄国要求大国不干涉中东国家的内政”为题刊载了谢皮洛夫的报告的详细摘要。这家报纸着重指出，和平共处是保卫和平的唯一方法。
    新华社14日讯　据塔斯社大马士革13日讯：“胜利报”说，苏联向美、英、法三国提出的关于中东和平和安全的建议是对美国诚意的考验。
    这家报纸强调指出，如果美国拒绝苏联的建议，那么“美国的拒绝将会使阿拉伯人更加相信美国对阿拉伯国家怀有野心和艾森豪威尔主义是危险的”。
    “光明报”说，苏联提出的在中东建立和平的六项明确的原则是以尊重阿拉伯国家主权和不干涉它们内政为基础的。
    这家报纸在评论苏联外交部长谢皮洛夫外交政策报告的社论中对苏联政府的建议给予很高的评价。报纸强调指出，这些建议“完全符合和平共处的政策”。
    这家报纸还说，谢皮洛夫报告中所阐明的原则完全符合阿拉伯人的愿望。苏联再次支持阿拉伯各国人民和他们的民族愿望，并且打击了帝国主义在“艾森豪威尔主义”的形式下或是在其他名称下企图对阿拉伯国家进行的阴谋和诡计。
    据新华社新德里14日电　苏联建议苏、美、英、法宣布关于中近东和平和安全的联合宣言的六项基本原则是13日印度报纸注意的中心。各报在头版显著地位以大字标题登载了苏联外交部长谢皮洛夫在最高苏维埃会议上的报告的详细摘要。
    印度报业托辣斯德里消息说，苏联提出的为了保证西亚和平的六点原则受到德里人士的欢迎。这家通讯社说，德里的观察家们认为，苏联的新建议看来将引起阿拉伯国家，特别是那些没有参加军事条约的国家极强烈的兴趣。
    它还说，观察家们满意地注意到，苏联外交部长强调宣布“和平共处”的方针——潘查希拉的原则之一——是苏联外交政策的基石；并且要求抛弃把西亚国家拖入军事集团的观念。
    “印度斯坦旗报”发表社论，对苏联的建议表示欢迎，它说这个建议“在通情达理、持久，道义和和平意义上来说，比那种带着军事救世主的粗鲁气味的艾森豪威尔主义不知要高出多少”。
    这家报纸指出，“提出艾森豪威尔主义的基础正好就是苏联方案主张扫除的那种恐惧和论调”。它接着说：“但是，如果把谢皮洛夫的建议的意义缩小为仅仅是对艾森豪威尔主义的宣传攻势的话，那就是眼光太短浅了。”这家报纸要求美国欢迎苏联的方案和研究方案所提出的各种机会。“这样才符合于中东人民和世界和平的最高利益”。
    “印度快报”写道：“谢皮洛夫已经为这个地区的完全中立提出了巩固的基础。这个基础如果被接受的话，将使外国的任何干涉都成为完全不正当，同时却又不致于影响以公正无私的方式提供迫切需要的经济援助。”
    “印度时报”的消息说，德里对苏联关于西亚的六点方案的反应是：苏联方案是“符合印度的想法的”。这家报纸的报道又说，谢皮洛夫的发言引起德里人士极大的兴趣。
