Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Beijing - The call was made to state-owned factories, mines, and enterprises in Beijing by the head of the Industry Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China at a meeting held the day before yesterday: Act immediately, rapidly mobilize the masses, and extensively launch the production increase and conservation movement. The secretaries of the Party organizations, factory directors, and ministers of the Industry Departments of the district committees of the Communist Party of China attended this meeting.

At the meeting, the head of the Industry Department first spoke about the fact that many units in the city have already formulated production increase and conservation plans. The enthusiasm of the masses of workers and staff in these units is very high, and they have launched various production increase and conservation activities. The situation in the units that have already taken action shows that the potential for increasing production and practicing economy is great. According to statistics from just over twenty units, this year it will be possible to increase production and conserve more than 13,000 tons of steel, more than 290,000 tons of coal, more than 6,000 tons of cement, more than 5.4 million kilowatt-hours of electricity, and more than 90,000 kilograms of raw cotton.

The head of the Industry Department said that the most common and most important problem in the current production increase and conservation movement is that the broad masses of workers and staff have not been fully mobilized. Most units are still in the stage of leaders deliberating and calculating, and some units have not even studied the issue of launching a production increase and conservation movement. Because the masses have not been fully mobilized, the production increase and conservation plans put forward by many units are careless and too low. For example, the Beijing Radio Management Office will use more than 4.4 million kilowatt-hours of electricity this year, but they only propose to save 8,000 kilowatt-hours, which is less than two-thousandths of this year's electricity consumption. The business income of trolleybuses of the Beijing Tram Company is planned to increase by 5.8% this year compared with last year, but the plan for profits turned over to the state is reduced by more than half compared with last year. Some units emphasize the objective difficulties such as insufficient raw materials this year, and believe that they cannot increase production or save money, so they are still hesitating and have not taken action.

The head of the Industry Department believes that the current situation needs to be changed immediately, and the leading cadres of all factories and mining enterprises must immediately take action, rapidly mobilize the masses, and extensively launch the production increase and conservation movement. In the movement, first of all, it is necessary to oppose and prevent conservative tendencies, and continue to implement the instructions of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China on demanding of oneself the highest standards that can be achieved, and learning from the advanced levels in the country. Secondly, different types of enterprises should put forward the direction and goals of increasing production and conserving resources according to their own circumstances and conditions. Raw material production departments such as metallurgy, fuel, power, and building materials should increase production targets as much as possible and make every effort to overfulfill national plans; machinery manufacturing, chemical, textile, food, and paper-making departments must use great efforts to reduce raw material consumption and use substitutes to increase production; transportation and postal and telecommunications departments must improve equipment utilization and labor efficiency, increase transportation and communication capacity, and pay attention to reducing the consumption of coal, electricity, and oil; factories under construction should do a good job in finishing and equipment installation projects, save state investment as much as possible, and strive to start production ahead of schedule. When formulating production increase and conservation plans, all units should not only pay attention to improving product quality and safety, but also carefully analyze the enterprise's situation, clarify the problems, take measures to reduce costs, and use all means to increase the profits turned over to the state.

    北京市有些厂矿增产节约计划草率偏低
    市委工业部要求迅速发动群众克服保守偏向
    据新华社讯　立即行动起来，迅速发动群众，广泛开展增产节约运动。这是中共北京市委员会工业部负责人，在前天召开的一个会议上向北京市国营厂矿、企业提出的要求。出席这个会议的有全市国营厂矿、企业的党组织书记、厂长和中共各区委员会工业部部长。
    工业部负责人在会上首先谈到：现在全市有许多单位已经制订了增产节约计划。这些单位的职工群众的积极性和热情很高，他们开展了各种各样的增产节约活动。已经行动起来的单位的情况说明，增产节约的潜力很大。仅据二十多个单位的统计，今年就可以增产节约钢铁一万三千多吨、煤二十九万多吨、水泥六千多吨、电力五百四十多万度、原棉九万多公斤。
    工业部负责人说，当前增产节约运动中最普遍、最主要的问题，是广大职工群众没有充分发动起来。多数单位还停留在领导干部酝酿、算账阶段，有的单位甚至还没有研究开展增产节约运动的问题。由于没有充分发动群众，许多单位提出来的增产节约计划草率、偏低。例如北京市无线电管理处今年要用电四百四十多万度，他们只提出节约八千度，还不到今年用电量的千分之二。北京市电车公司有轨电车的营业收入，今年计划比去年增加5.8％，而上缴利润计划却比去年减少了一半以上。有的单位强调今年原材料不足等客观困难，认为既不能增产，又不能节约，因此到现在还在犹豫，没有行动起来。
    工业部负责人认为目前这种情况需要立即加以改变，各厂矿企业的领导干部必须立即行动起来，迅速发动群众，广泛开展增产节约运动。在运动中，首先要反对和防止保守的偏向，继续贯彻执行中共北京市委员会关于以可能达到的最高标准要求自己的工作，向全国先进水平看齐的指示。其次，不同类型的企业应当根据自己的情况和条件，提出增产节约的方向和目标。冶金、燃料、电力、建筑材料等原材料生产部门，应当尽可能提高生产指标，尽最大努力去超额完成国家计划；机器制造、化学、纺织、食品、造纸等部门，必须用大力降低原材料消耗和使用代用品的办法增加生产；交通运输、邮电部门，必须提高设备运用率和劳动效率，增加运输和通讯能力，并且注意减少煤、电、油的消耗；正在建设的工厂要做好收尾工程和设备安装工程，尽量节约国家投资和争取提前开工生产。各单位在制订增产节约计划的时候，不仅要注意提高产品质量和安全，还要认真分析企业情况，弄清问题所在，采取措施降低成本，用一切办法增加上缴利润。
