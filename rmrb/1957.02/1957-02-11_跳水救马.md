    Diving to Save a Horse

    On January 5th, more than forty sleds from the Yuanda Agricultural Cooperative in Lianjiang Township, Kuandian County, Liaoning Province, formed a long sled team, advancing steadily towards Shajianzi in Huanren.

    "Just one more trip and we'll have delivered all the public grain for the cooperative." People were thinking this as they constantly whipped their animals onward. Suddenly, the sleds in front stopped. "The horse has fallen through the ice!" An alarming cry came from afar. People reined in their livestock and ran forward to see that the large yellow shaft horse of the first sled was gone, and bubbles were rising from the water. While people were at a loss, Wang Xiwu jumped into the water. He tried to grab it, but couldn't move it, so he shouted out, "One more person!" With a "splash," Liu Quanguo also jumped in. One lifted the sled shaft pressing down on the horse's head, and the other lifted the horse's head, raising the horse up. People were relieved to see that the horse was mostly unharmed. Only after the horse was pulled onto the ice did Wang Xiwu and Liu Quanguo feel numb all over, but seeing the large yellow horse had been rescued safely, they felt warm again.

    跳水救马
    1月5日，辽宁宽甸县连江乡远大农业社的四十多付爬犁，组成了一支长长的爬犁队，向桓仁沙尖子不停地前进着。
    “再有一趟就把全社的公粮送完了。”人们在这样想着，不时地挥动着鞭子前进。突然间前边的爬犁停下来，“马掉冰眼里了！”远远的传来了这样惊人的喊声。人们喝住了牲口，跑到前面去一看，第一付爬犁的大黄辕马不见了，水里直冒泡。人们正在手足无措的时候，王希武就跳下水里去了。他攀了一下，没攀动，就向外喊了一声：“再来一个！”随着“扑通”一声，刘全国也跳了下去。一个掀起压在马头上的爬犁辕子，一个抬起马头，把马抬了起来。人们一看马没怎么的，都松了一口气。当把马拉上冰后，王希武和刘全国才觉得混身麻木，但他们看到大黄马平安地被救了出来，心里也就又热呼呼的了。
