Editor's Note: 1956 was a year of rapid development in China's socialist construction and socialist transformation, and also a year of rapid growth in the ranks of the Chinese Communist Party. The number of new Party members who joined the Chinese Communist Party this year was more than in any previous year. New Party members are the Party's new blood, and the influx of large numbers of activists into the Party is a sign of the Party's continuous growth. However, the growth of the Party is not only determined by the number of Party members, but also by the quality of Party members. The Party Constitution specifically stipulates that Party organizations should conduct preliminary Party education for probationary Party members and examine the political qualities of probationary Party members. However, in the past year, many local Party grassroots organizations only paid attention to the development of Party members, but relaxed the examination and education of probationary Party members, which resulted in many probationary Party members not being able to become full members on schedule. The situation reflected in the letters from Party members published today exists in many places, which cannot but attract everyone's attention. In order to change this situation, it is hoped that Party organizations in various localities will conduct a serious inspection of the work of probationary Party members, criticize the idea of not attaching importance to this work, and then formulate methods for examining and educating probationary Party members and earnestly implement them. The work of the CPC Lushun-Dalian Electric Power Bureau Committee in examining and educating probationary Party members has been done relatively well and is worthy of reference.

    加强对预备党员的教育帮助预备党员按期转正
    编者按：1956年是我国社会主义建设和社会主义改造飞速发展的一年，也是中国共产党的队伍飞速壮大的一年。这一年中参加中国共产党的新党员比过去任何一年都多。新党员是党的新血液，大批积极分子涌进党的队伍是党不断壮大的标志。但党的壮大不只决定于党员的数量，更决定于党员的质量。党章中特别规定：党的组织应当向预备党员进行初步的党的教育，并且对预备党员的政治品质进行考察。可是，在过去一年中，不少地方党的基层组织只是注意了发展党员，却放松了对预备党员的考察和教育，结果就使许多预备党员不能按期转正。今天登的党员来信中所反映的情况很多地方都有，这不能不引起大家的注意。为了改变这种情况，希望各地党组织都能认真地检查一次预备党员的工作，批判不重视这一工作的思想，然后定出考察和教育预备党员的办法，切实地加以执行。中共旅大电业局委员会对预备党员的考察和教育的工作是做得比较好的，值得大家参考。
