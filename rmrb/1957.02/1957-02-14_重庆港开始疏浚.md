Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 12th - The dredging project, part of the Chongqing Port reconstruction project, commenced on the 10th.

    The task of the Sea Otter fleet, which started work first, is to excavate a 540-meter-long and 100-meter-wide pebble layer within the port in about three months, so that the Sichuan River fleet can directly approach the two wharves of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway station during the dry season. In this way, materials unloaded from the Chongqing Station and Jiulongpo Station of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway can be directly loaded onto the Sichuan River fleet even during the dry season.
    The Sea Eagle fleet, another fleet responsible for dredging, has been designated to undertake the dredging project at Jiulongtan. The blasting of reefs at Jiulongtan is also about to begin soon.

    重庆港开始疏浚
    据新华社重庆12日电　重庆港改建工程的一部分——疏浚工程，在10日动工。
    首先开工的海獭船队的任务，是要在三个月左右的时间内把港内一个长五百四十公尺、宽一百公尺的卵石层挖开，使川江船队在枯水时期也能直接靠近成渝铁路车站的两个码头。这样，从成渝铁路重庆站和九龙坡站卸下的物资，即使在枯水时期也可直接装上川江船队。
    担负疏浚任务的另一个船队——海鹰船队，被指定担任九龙滩的疏浚工程。九龙滩的炸礁工程不久也要开始进行。
