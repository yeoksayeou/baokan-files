Xinhua News Agency, Tonghua, 24th — February 23rd was the 17th anniversary of the death of General Yang Jingyu, one of the leaders of the former Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army. On this day, the Tonghua Local Committee of the Communist Youth League of Jilin Province and the Tonghua Municipal Committee jointly held a memorial report meeting to introduce to the broad masses of youth the deeds of General Yang Jingyu's arduous struggle for the revolutionary cause.

	The report meeting discussed General Yang Jingyu's deeds of integrating with the masses during the difficult years of the Anti-Japanese War, which moved everyone deeply. Around 1935, the Japanese invaders carried out large-scale "suppression" on the one hand and implemented the cruel "collective resettlement of households" system on the other, attempting to isolate the troops from the masses. Under extremely difficult circumstances, General Yang Jingyu and the soldiers ate whole corn cobs, soybeans, wild vegetables, and tree bark together. Once, an old villager named Deng Mingqing risked his life to send a few corn cakes to the troops, and General Yang Jingyu shared them with everyone. General Yang Jingyu also often sewed clothes and cooked food himself, and helped the masses with their work. Anyone in the troops who violated the discipline of the masses was subject to strict criticism and punishment. Because of this, although the Japanese invaders exhausted all kinds of vicious methods to try to isolate the troops from the masses, the masses still risked their lives to transport grain and supplies to support the Anti-Japanese Allied Forces.

	At the report meeting, the person in charge of the Communist Youth League called on everyone to learn from General Yang Jingyu's spirit of hard struggle and dedicate themselves to the socialist construction of the motherland.

	General Yang Jingyu was unfortunately surrounded by the enemy and gloriously martyred on February 23, 1940, in Sandao Mengjiang, Mengjiang County (renamed Jingyu County after liberation) in the Tonghua area.

    杨靖宇将军殉难十七周年
    通化举行纪念报告会
    新华社通化24日电　2月23日是原东北抗日联军领导者之一杨靖宇将军逝世十七周年纪念日。这一天，青年团吉林省通化地方委员会和通化市委员会联合举办纪念报告会，向广大青年介绍杨靖宇将军为革命事业艰苦奋斗的事迹。
    报告会上讲到杨靖宇将军在抗日战争艰苦年代里，和群众打成一片的事迹，使大家很受感动。1935年前后，日寇一面进行大“讨伐”，一面实行残酷的“集家并屯”制度，企图隔绝部队和群众的联系。在异常困难的情况下，杨靖宇将军和战士们一起吃整苞米、黄豆、野菜和树皮等。有一次，一个名叫邓明卿的老乡冒险送几块苞米饼子给部队，杨靖宇将军也都分给大家吃。杨靖宇将军还经常自己缝衣、作饭，并且帮助群众干活。部队中凡有违犯群众纪律的，都受到严格的批评和处分。因为这样，虽然日寇用尽各种毒辣办法企图隔绝部队和群众的联系，但群众还是冒着生命危险，运送粮食、用品支援抗联部队。
    在报告会上，青年团负责人号召大家学习杨靖宇将军艰苦奋斗的精神，献身于祖国的社会主义建设事业。
    杨靖宇将军是1940年2月23日在通化地区蒙江县（解放后改名靖宇县）的三道蒙江不幸被敌人包围后光荣殉国的。
