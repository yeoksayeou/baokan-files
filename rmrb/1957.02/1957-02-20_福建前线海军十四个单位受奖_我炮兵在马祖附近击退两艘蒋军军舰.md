Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, 19th - Fourteen units of the People's Liberation Army Navy stationed on the Fujian Front have recently been awarded prize banners by the Navy's leadership.

In the past year, the frontline naval units have achieved great results in performing tasks such as maritime patrols, escorts, protection of fisheries, combat, and military training. The units receiving awards are those with outstanding achievements. For example, the Third Squadron of a certain patrol boat detachment, which received the prize banner, escorted ships for more than 10,000 nautical miles in the past year, ensuring the safety of merchant ships each time. All signalmen at a certain signal station universally improved their technical level last year, creating excellent results in military training for the signal station. A certain anti-aircraft gun platoon achieved an "Excellent" rating in its overall training performance last year, and in three air defense operations, it shot down and damaged two Chiang Kai-shek military aircraft each, with the cooperation of fraternal units.

Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, 19th - On the 18th, a fierce artillery battle lasting 45 minutes took place in the waters between the Matsu Islands and the Huangqi Peninsula. The coastal artillery of the Chinese People's Liberation Army repelled two Chiang Kai-shek naval vessels that came to intercept our merchant ships.

The battle began at 00:45. Two Chiang Kai-shek naval vessels sneaked into the sea area about ten nautical miles east of the Minjiang estuary and indiscriminately bombarded merchant ships that had just passed the corner of the Huangqi Peninsula, firing more than 80 shells. Our coastal artillery immediately opened fire to suppress the enemy's artillery. After a fierce battle, the Chiang Kai-shek naval vessels scurried back to the Matsu Islands, and the merchant ships safely passed under the cover of our artillery fire.

On February 16th, Chiang Kai-shek naval vessels also intercepted merchant ships in this area once, firing more than 60 shells.

    福建前线海军十四个单位受奖
    我炮兵在马祖附近击退两艘蒋军军舰
    新华社福建前线19日电　中国人民解放军海军驻福建前线部队，有十四个单位最近分别受到海军领导机关授予奖旗的奖励。
    一年来前线海军部队在执行海上巡逻、护航、护渔、作战以及军事训练等项任务中，取得了很大成绩，受到奖励的是其中成绩比较突出的一些单位。如荣获奖旗奖励的某巡逻艇队第三中队，一年来护航航行一万余浬，每次都保护了商船的安全。某信号台全体信号兵去年普遍提高了技术水平，创造了信号台军事训练中的优秀成绩。某高射炮排，去年全年训练成绩总评“优秀”，并在三次对空作战中，在兄弟部队配合下击落击伤蒋军飞机各两架。
    据新华社福建前线19日电　18日，马祖列岛和黄岐半岛之间的海面上，发生了一次激烈的为时四十五分钟的炮战。中国人民解放军海岸炮兵击退了前来拦劫我商船的两艘蒋军军舰。
    战斗在零时四十五分开始。蒋军军舰二艘，窜抵闽江口以东十浬左右的海面，向刚驶过黄岐半岛角不久的商船滥施轰击，打炮八十多发。我海岸炮兵立刻开炮压制敌炮。经过激战，蒋军军舰窜回马祖列岛，商船在我军炮火掩护下安全驶过。
    2月16日，蒋军军舰还在这个地区拦击过一次商船，打炮六十多发。
