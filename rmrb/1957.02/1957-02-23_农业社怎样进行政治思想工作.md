    Agricultural Cooperatives' Political and Ideological Work
    Shandong Summarizes Several Experiences: Regularly Study Members' Ideological Situation, Promptly Dispel Concerns, Help Cooperative Cadres Study Policies, and Supervise Management Committees to Correctly Implement Policies
    Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, February 22nd: The propaganda departments of the Chinese Communist Party committees in Shandong Province have recently summarized some typical experiences on how agricultural cooperatives conduct political and ideological work. These typical experiences show that agricultural cooperatives that value political and ideological work implement the various guidelines and policies in running the cooperative relatively well, the enthusiasm of the members to participate in collective labor is very high, and it is easier to overcome difficulties encountered in the cooperative.
    The CCP branches of these agricultural cooperatives are able to carry out political and ideological education for the members based on their ideological situation in each period. The CCP branch of the Liyuxiang Agricultural Cooperative in Changqing County established a system for regularly studying the ideological situation of the members and, in light of these ideological situations, carried out socialist future education and collectivist education for the members in production teams on a regular basis. During the summer harvest last year, many members of this cooperative had doubts about the policy of advance distribution of wheat. At this time, the Party branch addressed the ideological concerns of middle peasants and households without labor, explained the specific distribution policies, and eliminated their confusion. Since the spring of last year, the three CCP branches in Huangzhuang Township, Junan County, have used various methods to educate members about cherishing the cooperative and organized love-the-cooperative competitions between teams and members. Now, most members have understood the principle that "when the big river has water, the small river is full, and when the big river has no water, the small river is dry." Phenomena such as not cherishing public property and harming collective interests have been greatly reduced. A member named Han Tingkuan once invested twelve cartloads of fertilizer in the cooperative, but the bookkeeper mistakenly recorded it as sixteen cartloads. After Han Tingkuan discovered this, he took the initiative to inform the cooperative to correct the error. Some female members who found corn cobs in the corn stalks they were allocated also took the initiative to return them to the cooperative. There was a period when the production teams of various cooperatives in Huangzhuang Township were not united. After the Party branches of each cooperative discovered this, they first carried out education on unity and good production within the Party, conducted criticism and self-criticism, and then explained to the members the principle that "a reduction in production in one team affects the entire cooperative." They also organized representatives from teams with conflicting opinions to exchange views and help them eliminate estrangement. Now, when some production teams are too busy, neighboring teams will take the initiative to help.
    Helping cooperative cadres study policies and supervising the cooperative management committee to correctly implement policies is an important part of the political and ideological work of the CCP branches of each cooperative. The CCP branch of the Lianmeng Agricultural Cooperative in Shankou Township, Zhaoyuan County, often organizes and helps cooperative cadres study the various guidelines and policies for running the cooperative, and helps the cooperative management committee study how to implement them. After the joint directive of the CCP Central Committee and the State Council on running cooperatives diligently and thriftily was issued, the CCP branch of this cooperative conscientiously organized the cooperative management committee to study and discuss it. In the second half of the year, the entire cooperative saved more than 500 yuan in administrative management expenses, reduced nearly 25,000 non-productive workdays, and increased sideline income by more than 5,000 yuan.
    Another common characteristic of the CCP branches of these agricultural cooperatives is that the Party's organizational life is normal, there is a regular Party class system, and they attach great importance to giving play to the role of the propaganda network. Many cooperatives have also established propaganda groups at the production team level. Therefore, the CCP members in these cooperatives can play a better role as backbone and leader.

    农业社怎样进行政治思想工作
    山东总结若干经验：定期研究社员思想情况，及时解除顾虑并帮助社干部学习政策，监督管理委员会正确执行政策
    新华社济南22日电　山东省各地中共党委的宣传部门，最近总结了一些农业社如何进行政治思想工作的典型经验。这些典型经验表明：凡是重视政治思想工作的农业社，办社中的各项方针政策就贯彻执行的比较好，社员们参加集体劳动的积极性就很高，社里碰到困难也就容易克服。
    这些农业社的中共支部，都能根据每个时期社员的思想状况来进行政治思想教育。长清县里峪乡农业社的中共支部，建立了定期研究社员思想情况的制度，并且针对这些思想状况，以生产队为单位定期对社员进行社会主义前途教育和集体主义教育。去年夏收的时候，这个社有不少社员对小麦预分的政策存在着怀疑。这时，党支部就针对中农、无劳力户等的思想顾虑，分别讲解分配的具体政策，消除了他们的混乱思想。莒南县黄庄乡的三个中共支部从去年春季开始，用多种多样的方法对社员进行爱社教育，并且组织开展了队与队、社员与社员之间的爱社竞赛，现在，大多数社员都已经明白了“大河里有水小河里满，大河无水小河里干”的道理，不爱护公共财产、损害集体利益的现象已经大大减少。社员韩廷款有一次向社里投资十二车肥料，被记账员错记为十六车，韩廷款发现后主动地告诉社里改正了这笔错账。有的女社员在分到的玉米秸里找到了玉米穗，也主动地送还给社里。黄庄乡各个社的生产队之间曾经有一个时期闹不团结。各个社的党支部发现以后，首先在党内进行团结搞好生产的教育，开展了批评和自我批评，接着又向社员们讲清了“一队减产、全社有份”的道理，并且组织互相有意见的队派代表交换意见，帮助他们消除隔阂。现在，当有的生产队忙不过来的时候，邻近的队就会主动地去进行帮助。
    帮助社干部学习政策，监督社务管理委员会正确地执行政策，这是各社中共支部进行政治思想工作中的一个重要内容。招远县山口乡联盟农业社的中共支部，经常组织和帮助社干部学习办社的各项方针政策，并且帮助社务管理委员会研究如何贯彻执行。去年中共中央和国务院关于勤俭办社的联合指示下达以后，这个社的中共支部认真组织社务管理委员会进行了学习和讨论。在下半年，全社就节省了五百多元行政管理费用，减少了近两万五千个非生产用工，并增加了五千多元的副业收入。
    这些农业社的中共支部还有另一个共同特点，就是党的组织生活正常，有定期的党课制度，并且十分重视发挥宣传网的作用，有不少社还以生产队为单位建立了宣传员小组。因此，这些社内的中共党员都能较好的发挥骨干和带头作用。
