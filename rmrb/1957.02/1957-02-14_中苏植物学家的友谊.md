Xinhua News Agency, 13th - Today, six experts, including Academician Sukachev, Director of the Forest Research Institute of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, who were invited to China to participate in the founding meeting of the Academic Committee of the Institute of Botany of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, gave academic reports. This will play a significant role in promoting research in taxonomy, geobotany, and cultivation in China's botanical community.

Academician Sukachev is a world authority on contemporary geobotany and forestry, and the creator of the school of forest typology. He and Balyanski, Director of the Museum of the Soviet Botanical Institute, respectively reported on the problem of species formation from the perspective of forests and algae. Species formation is a major issue in biology, and scholars from various countries are exploring it further. Their reports also presented new arguments on the relationship between plants and the influence of the environment. Professor Zong, Deputy Director of the Forest Research Institute, Professor Sokolov, Director of the Botanical Garden of the Institute of Botany, and geobotanist Dairis respectively gave reports on forest vegetation, the introduction and cultivation work of Soviet botanical gardens, and the classification system of larch. Dr. Fedorov of the Institute of Botany introduced the results of his research on tropical rainforests in Yunnan, China. He believes that the tropical and subtropical forests in southern Yunnan have extremely important research value in the origin of plants in the world.

Chinese and Soviet botanists have a deep friendship. Experts such as Fedorov have conducted more than two years of research with Chinese botanists in South China, and put forward many beneficial suggestions for Chinese botanical research. In recent years, the two sides have frequently exchanged thousands of plant specimens and books. The ancient lotus seeds and Chinese peach seeds, which have been preserved for hundreds of years in the Institute of Botany of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, were presented to the Soviet Botanical Institute several years ago, and have now blossomed and bear fruit.

    中苏植物学家的友谊
    新华社13日讯　今天，应邀来我国参加中国科学院植物研究所学术委员会成立大会的苏联科学院森林研究所所长苏卡契夫院士等六位专家分别作了学术报告。这对推进我国植物学界在分类学、地植物学、栽培学等方面的研究起着重大作用。
    苏卡契夫院士是世界当代地植物学和森林学的权威，也是林型学方面学派的创造者，他和苏联植物研究所博物馆主任巴良斯基分别报告了从森林、藻类出发研究的物种形成问题。物种形成是生物学中的一个重大问题，各国的学者正在进一步探索中。他们的报告同时对植物相互间的关系以及同环境的影响提出了新的论点。森林研究所副所长宗教授、植物研究所植物园主任索柯洛夫教授和地植物学家戴利斯分别作了有关森林植被、苏联植物园的引种栽培工作和落叶松分类系统问题的报告。植物研究所费德洛夫博士把他在我国云南研究热带雨林的结果作了介绍，他认为云南南部的热带林和亚热带林在世界植物起源上有着极重要的研究价值。
    中苏两国的植物学家有着深厚的友谊。费德洛夫等三位专家曾同中国植物学家一起在华南进行为时二年多的考察研究，对中国植物学研究提出了不少有益的意见。几年来双方经常交换植物标本、图书达数千份。中国科学院植物研究所保存的有几百年之久的种籽——古莲子以及中国桃种籽，几年前赠送给苏联植物研究所，现在已经开了花，结了果。
