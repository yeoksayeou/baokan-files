Whose Responsibility?
Xiao Zhao

Two days before the Spring Festival, I saw two elementary school students, about fourteen or fifteen years old, standing in a long line at the Xisi Cooperative in Beijing.

They were talking. The one standing behind asked the one in front: "How many times have you queued up today?" The student in front turned around, looking annoyed, and replied, "Three times already, and all to buy meat! My family has already bought three jin of pork, but when my dad gets home from work, he still complains it's not enough and argues with my mom. Mom says she's afraid people will talk if we buy too much. Dad says it doesn't matter for kids, they'll just come back if they don't sell to them. The uncle selling the meat already knows me, and I'm really embarrassed." The one behind him also complained, "You only queued up three times, that's nothing. Yesterday, I ran to several cooperatives to buy meat, and my legs are sore. My mom also asked someone in their office to buy a few more jin of meat, but she's still afraid it won't be enough to eat and insisted that I join in the fun."

From their conversation, it's clear that the parents of these two students are both government cadres. They must know that this year the Party and the government are calling on government cadres to have a thrifty Spring Festival and not compete with the masses for New Year's goods. These parents probably thought that their children wouldn't understand this principle, and would happily go shopping anyway. Even if they queued up too much and were pointed out by others, it wouldn't matter since they are just children. They never thought about the bad influence they were giving their children for their own selfish interests!

Letting children queue up to buy a few more jin of pork may seem like a trivial matter in daily life, but it is precisely these kinds of "trivial matters" that constantly influence children's thoughts and feelings, and affect their moral character. For example, some people ask their children to bring back broken wood from construction sites to take advantage of small gains. If someone comes looking for them, they are clearly at home, but they tell their children to say "Dad isn't here." They chat and gossip with friends, discussing right and wrong, without paying attention to whether the children are present. When they come home from work, they get easily angry and lose their temper, banging on the table and throwing chairs, arguing and cursing as if it were normal. They casually ask their children to fetch this and that while lying in bed, even asking them to take off their shoes and socks... These things seem insignificant, but they are imperceptibly instilling many harmful things into children. Over time, these things take root and sprout in children, leading to bad behavior and bad habits, such as despising labor, being arrogant and conceited, hitting and scolding people, and disobeying discipline. And parents are distressed and troubled by this, unable to understand why. In fact, they are the ones who taught their children.

Can we blame the children for not improving? Can we blame the teachers for not educating the students well? In my opinion, a lot of the responsibility lies with the parents. Instead of appealing to society when children's morals are corrupted, it is better to pay attention early and take responsibility for educating them.

### 谁的责任？

    谁的责任？
    萧照
    春节前两天，在北京西四合作社里，我看见了两个排在长长的队伍中的十四、五岁的小学生。
    他俩在交谈。站在后边的一个问前边的：“你今天排几次队了？”站在前边的学生转过身，显出生气的样子回答：“三次了，还都是买肉！家里已经买了三斤猪肉，爸爸下班回来一看还嫌少，跟妈妈吵。妈妈说，买得多了怕别人说。爸爸说，小孩子不要紧，人家不卖给再回来。卖肉的叔叔都认识我了，真有点不好意思。”后边的一个听了也埋怨地说：“你排三次队还算好哪，昨天一整天我跑了好几个合作社买肉，腿都跑酸了。我妈妈在他们机关里又托人买了几斤肉，还怕不够吃，一定要我来凑这个热闹。”
    从谈话中可以断定这两位同学的父母都是机关干部。他们一定知道了今年党和政府号召机关干部俭朴过春节，不同群众争买年货。这几位爸爸妈妈以为孩子们大概不懂得这道理，一定会高高兴兴去买，万一排队多了被别人指出来，反正是小孩子也没有关系。他们根本不想一想为了自己的自私自利打算而给了孩子们怎样恶劣的影响！
    让孩子排排队，多买几斤猪肉，这也许是日常生活中的小事吧，但正是这类“小事”时时刻刻影响着孩子们的思想感情，影响着他们的精神品质。譬如有些人为占一点小便宜，叫孩子到工地拿回破木料；有人来找，自己明明在家，却叫孩子去说“爸爸不在”；同朋友在一起说长道短，谈是论非，孩子在场也旁若无人；下班到家，遇事稍不如意就大发雷霆，敲桌子摔椅子，吵吵骂骂，习以为常；睡在床上随意叫孩子拿这拿那，甚至要孩子为自己脱鞋、去袜子……。这些事看来好像是微不足道的，可是无形中给孩子灌输了许多有害的东西。日久天长，在孩子身上生了根，发了芽，于是不良的行为发生了，恶劣习气出现了，轻视劳动，骄傲自负，打人骂人，不服管教。而家长也因之苦闷烦恼，百思不得其解，其实都是自己教给孩子的。
    这难道怨孩子不长进吗？怪老师没教育好学生吗？据我看，不少责任在做父母的身上。与其到孩子品德败坏时向社会呼吁，倒不如及早注意，负起教育孩子的责任。
