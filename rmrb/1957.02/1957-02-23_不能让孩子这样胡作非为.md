Reader's Letter:

    We Can't Let Children Behave So Recklessly

    Comrade Editor:

    The problem of noisy children of responsible cadres at the Beijing University of Political Science and Law has existed for a long time. The school has repeatedly asked parents to pay attention and has also adopted the method of notification and criticism of some parents, but the problem has not been resolved. The parents of these children are Party Secretary Wang Run, Director of the Marxism-Leninism Basic Teaching and Research Section Xu Jingzhi, and Deputy Director of the Criminal Procedure Teaching and Research Section Yu Feng. Despite the children's noise, the parents rarely discipline their children. As a result, the children have developed from making noise and fighting to destruction and theft, seriously affecting students' studies and damaging the school's reputation.

    At first, these children were just running around and shouting loudly. Later, some children naturally formed "small groups," often gathering together, holding wooden sticks and stones to fight each other, and they also bullied other children in the courtyard. This kind of noise disrupted the school's tranquility. When classmates offered advice, they would curse and throw stones at them. Many lecturers, teaching assistants, and some cadres in our institute have been cursed by the children more than once. These children sometimes went to the countryside in groups, beat up the children of the masses, and repeatedly aroused the dissatisfaction of the masses, some of whom traced them back to the school and raised their opinions.

    When students were in class, these children climbed on the windows to make strange noises and threw soil at the classroom, making it impossible for students to listen to lectures and teachers to teach. The school spent a lot of effort to green the campus, but they actively destroyed the saplings and broke the flowers and trees. They learned that many things could be exchanged for money or candy, so they began to steal. They once went to the students' washroom and squeezed out all the toothpaste and took the toothpaste skins to exchange for candy. They once stole pliers from bags on parked bicycles and were chased away; they once stole money from clothes taken off by students on the sports field and were chased back by the physical education teacher. They knocked off the copper pipes on fire extinguishers and sold them for money; they also broke the windows of the iron workshop and climbed in to steal scrap iron. It is so noteworthy that young children have developed to this point!

    Comrade Editor, the school leaders have repeatedly asked the parents to pay attention to the children's reckless behavior, but strangely, these parents have not strengthened their children's education. Now, I raise this issue again, hoping to attract the attention of these parents.

### 不能让孩子这样胡作非为

    不能让孩子这样胡作非为
    编辑同志：
    北京政法学院负责干部的小孩吵闹问题存在已久，学校曾再三提请家长注意，也曾采取通报的办法，对有些家长进行了批评，但问题仍然没有解决。这些小孩的家长是党委书记王润、马克思列宁主义基础教研室主任徐敬之、刑讼教研室副主任于峰等人，尽管小孩吵闹，家长却很少管教自己的小孩。以致孩子从吵闹、殴打发展到破坏和偷盗，严重地影响了学生的学习，也损害了学校的名誉。
    起初，这些小孩还只是东奔西跑，高声怪叫。后来，有些小孩自然结成“小集团”，经常集聚一起，手持木棍、石子互相殴打，他们也欺侮院内其他小孩。这样的吵闹，破坏了学校应有的安静。当同学向他们提出劝告时，他们就破口大骂，并用石子打同学。我院不少讲师、助教及一些干部曾不止一次地遭受到孩子们的恶骂。这些小孩有时群集下乡，殴打群众的小孩，多次引起群众的不满，有的群众曾追踪到校，提出意见。
    同学在课堂上上课时，这些小孩爬在窗户上怪叫、向教室掷土块，使学生无法听课，教员不能讲课，学校曾花了不少劲去绿化校园，他们却积极摧残小树，折断花木。他们了解到不少东西可以拿去换钱或糖果，于是就开始了偷。他们曾到同学洗脸室内把牙膏挤光，把牙膏皮拿去换糖吃。他们曾在停放自行车的包内偷钳子，被人赶走；他们曾在体育场上从同学脱下的衣服里偷钱，被体育教员追回。他们曾将消防器上的铜管敲下拿去卖钱；又打破铁工房的窗子爬进去偷碎铁。幼小的孩童发展到这样，这是多么值得注意啊！
    编辑同志，对小孩的这种胡闹行为，学校领导上曾再三提请家长注意，但奇怪的是：这些家长并没有加强对孩子的教育。现在，我再一次提出，希望能引起这些家长的注意。　　杨俊（附图片）
