To Improve Transportation Strain in Northwest China
    Lo-Shan Section of Longhai Railway to be Double-Tracked

    (Our newspaper reports) Preparations for the double-tracking of the Luoyang-Shanxian section of the Longhai Railway began as early as November of last year. More than 23,000 square meters of temporary housing have now been completed, and temporary communication lines have been erected from Huixing to Jingu Garden. The meeting stations between Guanletang and Xiashi, and between Miaogou and Zhangmao, have started construction successively. The first engineering teams for the new critical Xiashi and Guanyintang tunnels are actively preparing for construction.

    The Luoyang-Shanxian section of the Longhai Railway is approximately 140 kilometers long and is currently one of the most congested sections of railway transportation in Northwest China. Once the double track is completed, the transportation capacity will be greatly improved, which will play a significant role in improving the railway transportation situation in Northwest China.

    改善西北运输紧张状况
    陇海铁路洛陕段复线开工
    本报讯　陇海铁路复线洛阳、陕县段的施工准备工作，早在去年11月就已开始。现在已完成临时房屋两万三千多平方公尺，临时通信已由会兴架至金谷园。观乐堂—硖石间、庙沟—张茅间两处会让站，已先后开工，新建硖石、观音堂两座关键隧道的第一工程段职工正积极准备施工。
    陇海铁路洛阳、陕县段长约一百四十公里，是目前西北铁路运输紧张的地段之一。将来修起复线后，运输能力可以大大提高，对改善西北铁路运输状况将起很大作用。
