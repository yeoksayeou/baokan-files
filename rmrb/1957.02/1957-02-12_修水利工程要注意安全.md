    Pay Attention to Safety in Water Conservancy Projects

    In some areas of Jilin Province, serious casualties have occurred in the construction of farmland water conservancy projects due to insufficient attention to safety in construction sites. For example, in the Xin Sheng Advanced Agricultural Cooperative of Sankeyushu Township, Yinggebu District, Tonghua County, during the repair of a water conservancy project on November 2, earth was being extracted from a mountain, and because too much soil was taken from the lower part, the soil above collapsed, immediately burying five people. After rescue, two people were seriously injured and three were slightly injured. In the counties of Jiaohe and Huadian, five people were injured or killed while extracting earth to build reservoirs, including two deaths.

    Currently, soil and water conservation and water conservancy projects are underway in various places. In order to ensure construction safety and eliminate personal injury accidents, all localities should learn from this painful lesson, repeatedly and patiently carry out publicity and education among the masses regarding the idea of safe construction, and designate specific personnel to be responsible for safe construction work.　Tian Xiangchun

    修水利工程要注意安全
    吉林省有些地区，在兴修农田水利工程中，由于对工地安全施工重视不够，以致发生了严重的伤亡事故。如通化县英戈布区三棵榆树乡新生高级农业社，在11月2日补修水利工程中，开山取土，因取下边的土较多，上边的土塌下来，当时就压倒五人。经抢救后，有两人受重伤，三人轻伤。蛟河、桦甸县亦因修水库取土伤亡五人，其中两人死亡。
    目前，各地的水土保持和水利兴修等工程正在进行，为了确保施工安全，杜绝人身伤亡事故，各地应该接受这个沉痛的教训，把安全施工的思想，在群众中进行反复的耐心的宣传教育，并指定专人负责安全施工工作。　田向春
