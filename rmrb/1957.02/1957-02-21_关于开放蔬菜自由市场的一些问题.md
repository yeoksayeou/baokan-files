    Some Questions Concerning the Opening of the Free Vegetable Market
    Sun Jian
    After many cities opened free vegetable markets, the quality of vegetables generally improved compared to before, and the variety also increased. At the same time, some new problems have arisen: disputes have occurred in the execution of contracts signed between vegetable companies and agricultural cooperatives in certain regions; state-owned companies have had difficulty controlling the source of goods; and there is a lack of knowledge on how to lead and manage the prices of the free vegetable market. In some areas, the retail price of vegetables has risen, causing many consumer complaints. Therefore, some cities have taken several administrative measures after opening the free vegetable market; these measures, in essence, have canceled the free vegetable market.
    Currently, there are basically three types of vegetable markets in various regions:
    The first type includes regions that have already opened free vegetable markets, such as Shanghai, Guangzhou, Xinhui, Nanchang, Wuzhou, Wuhan, etc. Most of these cities have established trading markets and formed market management committees, allowing vegetable farmers to directly trade with vendors and institutional canteens. There are two methods of price management: posting the highest and lowest prices, or posting the wholesale and retail prices of medium-quality vegetables as a reference; or organizing a joint pricing method between producers, sellers, and market management departments. Some areas, such as Guangzhou, have also established purchasing and wholesale stations of state-owned companies within the free market to regulate supply and demand and stabilize prices based on market supply and demand.
    The second type is some cities in the Northeast, such as Harbin, Changchun, etc. Because the past few months have been the off-season for production, there are very few varieties of vegetables on the market, mainly stored Chinese cabbage and radishes. These areas believe that opening the free vegetable market now would not have much effect and would not achieve the goal of stimulating production and ensuring needs. Therefore, they have not yet opened the free market.
    The third type is regions that have spontaneously opened free vegetable markets. Because state-owned companies have had difficulty controlling the source of goods, and the prices of certain varieties have risen significantly, several administrative measures have been taken to restrict and cancel the free vegetable market.
    How should the free vegetable market be opened? Do the prices of the free vegetable market need to be managed and led? What are the tasks of vegetable companies after the free market is opened? I would like to offer some opinions on these questions for discussion:
    First, should vegetables be allowed to have a free market? Facts have proven that opening a free market has many benefits, mainly reflected in: reducing circulation links, ensuring fresh quality, enabling producers to pay more attention to the variety and quality of vegetables through free transactions, and direct transactions between producers and sellers also strengthen the relationship between the two parties; state-owned companies also improve their operation and management, saving manpower and material resources. Therefore, opening a free vegetable market is beyond doubt.
    Vegetables are different from materials subject to unified purchase and also different from general small local and special products; they are non-staple foods needed by the broad masses of people every day, and there is a contradiction between seasonal production and year-round consumption. The variety, specifications, and quality are also very complex. Thus, under the premise that a socialist unified market has already been formed, it is necessary and possible to allow a certain range of free vegetable markets under the unified leadership of the state. The state's leadership is reflected in: the market demand plan proposed by state-owned companies, the certain operating business of state-owned companies for major varieties, the state's control of beans and processed products that can be adjusted during the off-season for vegetables, and the seasonal adjustment of varieties between regions. A certain range of freedom is reflected in: producers can formulate and modify production plans based on market conditions and water conservancy, manpower, soil, and planting conditions, and producers, retailers, and catering groups can directly trade in the market and directly negotiate prices. This market can ensure the supply and reasonable stability of prices of major varieties through the operation of state-owned companies, and at the same time, it can stimulate production and change the situation of declining quality.
    How to lead and manage the free vegetable market?
    It should be affirmed that the leadership and management of the free vegetable market should mainly be carried out through the economic measures of state-owned companies, and it is generally not appropriate to interfere with administrative measures. State-owned companies should operate a certain proportion of the main varieties of each period according to different seasons and control a certain source of goods; only with material strength can they easily stabilize prices and regulate supply and demand through economic activities.
    Must the free vegetable market be designated to trade in a certain place? Judging from the current situation in various places, this is mostly the case. With fixed places, it is convenient for state-owned companies to grasp the market situation of the day at any time, and they can balance and adjust between market A and market B in terms of varieties, and it is also convenient to count the number of transactions every day. This is a good thing. However, I think it is also possible not to restrict free transactions to fixed places. Especially during the peak production season, when there are many varieties on the market, allowing vendors and institutional groups to trade off-site is not harmful to ensuring supply. If it is a transaction that has already signed a contract, it is naturally not necessary to trade at a designated market. However, in the off-season, especially in the winter and spring seasons in northern cities, there are few varieties of vegetables on the market, and they mainly rely on stored Chinese cabbage, radishes, and the like. In order to ensure the stability of market prices and a relatively appropriate distribution of goods, it is possible to adopt a combination of contract transactions and on-site transactions. Vegetables from vegetable farmers' private plots and vegetables from agricultural cooperatives that have completed the tasks stipulated in the contract should be allowed to be freely traded off-site. As for individual varieties, when price fluctuations occur due to supply and demand imbalances, it is generally appropriate to adopt the method of state-owned companies transferring them from other places and selling them in the market to stabilize prices. In short, it is necessary to study these issues from the perspective of whether it is conducive to developing production. Seasonal fine vegetables with very little transaction volume and are not the main varieties can be freely priced and traded on-site and off-site under any circumstances, because this will not have a great impact on the lives of the broad masses of people.
    Second, should the prices of the free vegetable market be led and managed? This question is directly related to the production interests of vegetable farmers on the one hand, and on the other hand, it is directly related to the living burden of the broad masses of people. Ensuring the reasonable stability of vegetable prices is absolutely necessary. Vegetables have great production risks, and it is not easy to achieve a balance between production and sales. From these situations, one of the main aspects that determine vegetable prices is whether the relationship between supply and demand is balanced. Whether the price is reasonable and stable should also be considered from the perspective of being conducive to production and ensuring supply. Should the prices of the free vegetable market be managed by administrative means? My understanding is: this method is generally not appropriate. However, in a certain period, when the price of vegetables in the free market rises too much due to an imbalance in supply and demand, it will directly affect the execution of the delivery contract between the agricultural cooperative and the state-owned company, and the state-owned company will not be able to regulate supply and demand through buying and selling. Should the free market post price tags? I believe that it is necessary for state-owned companies to post the wholesale and retail prices of the main varieties, and this price can be used as a reference for transactions between producers and sellers. Vegetables are highly seasonal. Therefore, the price leadership of state-owned companies in the free market can prevent "cheap vegetables harming farmers" in the peak season of concentrated marketing; and mainly prevent excessive price increases in the off-season that affect the lives of workers. The method to solve this problem is mainly: narrowing the gap between supply and demand by expanding sales and state-owned companies' purchase and processing in the peak season; and stabilizing vegetable prices through state-owned companies' market sales in the off-season. As for pricing, I think it can also be organized by the market management department under the principle of voluntary participation of both producers and sellers, as long as this price can take into account the interests of producers, retailers, and consumers, it is not harmful. The same variety of vegetables in the same city should be allowed to have different freely traded prices; because the quality of vegetables is difficult to unify, the price cannot be required to be unified.
    Third, what are the tasks of state-owned companies after the free vegetable market is opened? I think there are three main tasks:
    (1) Study production and sales conditions, grasp the laws of production and sales in various regions, and propose opinions on production planning. Because vegetable commodities are highly seasonal, by grasping the laws of the off-season and peak season, we can study with the production department and take effective measures to solve the contradictions in production and sales, and gradually narrow the gap between backlog in the peak season and insufficient supply in the off-season. Facts have proven that each region has certain market off-season and peak season laws; if the arrangement of production is more detailed, and the time to market of the number of varieties, the combination of local vegetables and those adjusted from other places, etc., is grasped, the production and sales relationship will be further improved.
    (2) Operate a certain proportion of the main local vegetables, bean products, and the main varieties adjusted between regions. After the free market is opened, the specific business operations of state-owned companies may change compared to the period of guaranteed purchase and sales; but this does not mean that they no longer engage in specific business, only manage the market. If you do not control a certain source of goods, it is difficult to achieve leadership over the free market.
    (3) Achieve leadership over the free market through purchasing and sales activities, and organize direct transactions between producers and sellers to help them sign contracts. In general cities, all major varieties that have the conditions to be transacted through contracts should be actively organized. In addition, in terms of retail, retail markets should be increased to adapt to the growth of the population, and the positive role of retailers should be used to make it convenient for the broad masses of workers to buy vegetables.
    After the free market is opened, the market changes greatly, the situation is relatively complicated, and the specific situation of each city is not exactly the same. Therefore, carefully studying and solving these problems is necessary to correctly exert the role of the free market, better develop production, and ensure consumer needs.

    关于开放蔬菜自由市场的一些问题
    孙健
    许多城市在开放蔬菜自由市场以后，蔬菜质量一般比以前提高了，品种也增加了。同时，发生了一些新的问题：某些地区的蔬菜公司和农业社签订的合同，在执行中发生了纠纷，国营公司掌握货源有了困难；对蔬菜自由市场的价格不知道如何领导和管理，有些地区的蔬菜零售价格一度上涨，引起消费者很多的意见。因此，有些城市在开放蔬菜自由市场以后，又采取了若干行政措施；这些措施，实质上是取消了蔬菜的自由市场。
    目前，各地的蔬菜市场基本上有三种类型：
    第一种是已经开放蔬菜自由市场的地区，如上海、广州、新会、南昌、梧州、武汉等。这些城市大都建立了交易市场，成立了市场管理委员会，允许菜农同商贩和机关伙食团直接成交。在价格管理方面有两种方法：挂出最高价和最低价，或挂出中等质量的批发价、零售价，作为参考；或者组织产销双方及市场管理部门共同议价的方式。有些地区，如广州，还在自由市场内设立国营公司的采购批发站，根据市场供求情况吞吐，调节供求，稳定价格。
    第二种是东北的一些城市，如哈尔滨，长春等地，由于几个月来是生产淡季，上市蔬菜品种很少，主要是储存的大白菜萝卜等。这些地区认为现在开放蔬菜自由市场的作用不大，不会因为开放自由市场而达到刺激生产保证需要的目的。因此，现在还没有开放自由市场。
    第三种是自发地开放了蔬菜自由市场的地区，由于国营公司掌握货源发生困难，某些品种价格上涨很多，因此，又采取了若干行政措施，限制和取消了蔬菜自由市场。
    应该怎样开放蔬菜自由市场？蔬菜自由市场的价格是否需要进行管理和领导？开放自由市场以后蔬菜公司的任务是什么？对这些问题，我提出一些意见供大家商讨：
    第一，蔬菜是否应当开放自由市场？事实证明，开放自由市场的好处很多，主要表现在：减少了流转环节，质量鲜嫩，通过自由成交使生产者更加关心蔬菜的品种和质量，产销直接成交也密切了双方的关系；国营公司也因而改善了经营管理，节约了人力和物力。因此，开放蔬菜自由市场是不容置疑的。
    蔬菜不同于统购物资，也不同于一般小土特产；它是广大人民每天需要的副食品，又有季节生产和常年消费的矛盾，花色品种、规格质量又十分复杂。这样，在社会主义统一市场已经形成的前提下，就必须也可能在国家统一领导下，允许有一定范围的蔬菜自由市场。国家的领导表现在：有国营公司提出的市场需要计划，有国营公司对主要品种一定的经营业务，国家掌握豆类、加工品可以在蔬菜淡季加以调剂，还可以进行地区间季节性的品种调剂。一定范围的自由表现在：生产者可以根据市场情况和水利、人力、土壤、种植条件制定和修改生产计划，生产者同零售商贩和伙食团体可以在市场上直接成交，双方直接议价。这种市场既可以通过国营公司的经营，保证主要品种的供应和价格的合理稳定，同时又可以刺激生产，改变质量下降的局面。
    怎样对蔬菜自由市场进行领导管理呢？
    应当肯定，对蔬菜自由市场的领导和管理，主要应该通过国营公司的经济措施，一般不宜采取行政措施加以干涉。国营公司应根据不同季节，对每个时期的主要品种经营一定的比重，掌握一定的货源；只有具备了物质力量，才便于通过经济活动来稳定价格、调剂供求。
    蔬菜自由市场是否必须指定在某个地方进行交易呢？从现在各地的情况来看，大都是这样做的。有了固定的场所，便于国营公司随时掌握当天的市场情况，在品种上可以进行甲、乙市场之间的平衡和调剂，也便于统计每天的成交数量。这是好的一面。但是，我认为也可以不限制在固定场所进行自由成交。特别是在生产旺季，上市品种数量很多，允许商贩和机关团体在场外成交，对保证供应来说也没有害处。如果是已经签订合同的交易，自然更没有必要必须到指定市场成交。但是，在生产淡季，特别是北方城市的冬春两季，上市的蔬菜品种少，而且主要是依靠储存的大白菜、萝卜之类，为了保证市场价格的稳定和比较适当的分配货源，可以多采取合同成交和场内成交相结合的方式。对菜农的自留土地的蔬菜和农业社已经完成合同规定的任务以外的蔬菜，应允许在场外自由成交。至于个别品种，因供求失调而发生价格波动的时候，一般也宜于采取国营公司由外地调运在市场出售的方式来稳定价格。总之，必须从是否有利于发展生产来研究这些问题。成交量很少又非主要品种的季节性的细菜，任何情况下，都可以允许在场内场外自由议价成交，因为这对广大人民的生活是不会有很大影响的。
    第二，蔬菜自由市场的价格是否应当进行领导和管理呢？这个问题，一方面直接涉及菜农的生产利益，另一方面也同广大群众的生活负担有直接关系。保证蔬菜价格的合理稳定是绝对必需的。蔬菜在生产上的风险性很大，产销又不易做到平衡，从这些情况研究，决定蔬菜价格的一个主要方面是供求关系是否平衡。而考察价格的是否合理、稳定，也应从有利于生产和保证供应来考虑问题。蔬菜自由市场的价格是否应该用行政的办法管理呢？我的认识是：一般不宜采取这个办法。但在一定时期，因供求失调而自由市场蔬菜价格上涨过多的时候，会直接影响到农业社和国营公司的交货合同的执行，也就不能使国营公司通过吞吐来调节供求。自由市场是否应该挂出牌价呢？我认为，国营公司挂出主要品种的批发、零售价格是有必要的，这个价格可以作为产销双方成交的参考。蔬菜的季节性很强，因此，国营公司对自由市场的价格领导，在生产集中上市的旺季，可以防止“菜贱伤农”；在淡季又主要是防止菜价上涨过多而影响职工生活。解决这个问题的方法，主要是：在旺季通过扩大推销和国营公司的收购加工来缩小供过于求的差距；在淡季通过国营公司的市场销售来稳定菜价。至于议价，我认为在产销双方自愿的原则下也可由市场管理部门组织进行，只要这个价格能兼顾生产者、零售商贩和消费者的利益，是没有害处的。蔬菜的同一品种在同一城市应允许有不同的自由成交的价格；因为蔬菜质量很难统一，价格也就不能要求统一。
    第三，蔬菜自由市场开放后，国营公司的任务是什么呢？我认为主要任务有三点：
    （一）研究产销情况，掌握各个地区产销规律，提出关于生产规划的意见。由于蔬菜商品的季节性强，掌握了淡季旺季的规律，就可以同生产部门研究，采取有效措施来解决产销上的矛盾，逐步缩小旺季积压和淡季供应不足的差距。事实证明，每个地区都有一定的市场淡旺的规律；如果在布置安排生产方面再做得细致些，掌握了品种数量的上市时间、当地菜与外地调剂的结合等情况，产销关系就会进一步改善。
    （二）经营一定比重的当地的主要蔬菜、豆制品和地区间调节的主要品种。自由市场开放后，国营公司的具体经营业务同包购包销时期相比，可能有些变化；但这决不意味着不再经营具体业务，只有管理市场的任务了。如果不掌握一定的货源，就很难实现对自由市场的领导。
    （三）通过购销活动实现对自由市场的领导，并组织产销直接成交，帮助他们签订合同。在一般城市，凡是有条件通过合同成交的主要品种，都应积极加以组织。此外，在零售方面，应适应人口的增长，增设零售市场，利用零售商贩的积极作用，使广大职工买菜方便。
    自由市场开放以后，市场变化很大，情况比较复杂，而且各个城市的具体情况也不尽一样，因此，慎重地研究解决这些问题，对于正确地发挥自由市场的作用，更好地发展生产和保证消费者的需要，都是很必要的。
