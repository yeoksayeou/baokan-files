    Salvage This Wealth
    Tangshan ceramics are sold throughout the country and have begun to be exported in large quantities last year. Since the beginning of this year, the supply of clay, the main raw material for ceramic production, has been insufficient. After actively searching for substitute raw materials, normal production has been maintained, but the raw material supply is still tight.
    However, since last winter, the Third Engineering Department of the Kailuan Coal Mine Basic Construction Engineering Bureau in Tangshan has been digging out about 200 tons of large-groove clay near the Majiagou Coal Mine every day to fill large pits. Since last year, various ceramic factories have negotiated with the Third Engineering Department to purchase this batch of clay, but they have used the excuse of wanting to study it with the bauxite mine, and have allowed the clay to continue to fill the pits. The Fourth Mining Area of the Bauxite Mine said that the clay belongs to the Bauxite Mine and should be sold uniformly by the Bauxite Mine, and proposed a selling price of 1.6 yuan per ton; the Third Engineering Department considered the price too low and did not agree. A large amount of wealth is being wasted in vain. It is hoped that the relevant authorities in Tangshan City will actively salvage this wealth.

    抢救这笔财富
    唐山的陶瓷行销全国各地，并在去年开始大量出口。今年以来，生产陶瓷的主要原料——粘土供应不足，经过积极寻找代用原料，才算维持了正常生产，但是原料供应仍旧处在紧张状态中。
    但是唐山开滦煤矿基本建设工程局第三工程处从去年冬天以来，每天在马家沟煤矿附近挖出二百吨左右大槽粘土，用来填了大坑。各陶瓷厂从去年就向第三工程处交涉购买这批粘土，他们借口要同矾土矿研究，就让粘土继续填坑。矾土矿第四采矿区说，粘土为矾土矿所有，应由矾土矿统一销售，并提出每吨售价是一元六角；第三工程处认为价钱太低，没有答应。大量财富就这样白白浪费掉了。希望唐山市有关机关积极抢救这笔财富。
