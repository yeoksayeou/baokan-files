Yunnan, February 4th (From Our Newspaper) In order to strive for a greater harvest this year, Yunnan Province is focusing on water conservancy projects and fertilizer accumulation as production increase measures in the spring plowing preparations.

The province's winter water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation work is better and more extensive than last year. According to statistics from fifty-seven counties, the water stored in large and small ponds is now sufficient to irrigate more than two million mu of land. The amount of water stored in various parts of the Qujing Special District has increased compared to the same period last year. In counties such as Luliang, Fuyuan, and Lunan, it has increased by 60%-70% compared to last year. The accumulation of fertilizer in the province has been completed by 30%-50%. Lunan County had completed more than 70% of the required fertilizer before the Spring Festival. In the Jianshui Guanting District of the Mengzi Special District, 4.5 million catties of fertilizer were accumulated in ten days. In the JianShe Township agricultural cooperative of Suijiang County, 420,000 catties of fertilizer were accumulated in one week. In Dehong, Xishuangbanna and other places, the Dai people did not have the habit of accumulating fertilizer in the past. In order to strive for greater harvests, they are also actively opening up fertilizer sources and carrying out fertilizer accumulation activities.

Agricultural cooperatives in counties such as Yuxi, Yiliang, Jinning, and Lunan have earnestly processed the minor spring crops. They applied top dressing fertilizer to broad bean, wheat, and rapeseed fields. In Xishuangbanna, Dehong, Honghe Hani Autonomous Prefecture and other places where the season starts earlier, some agricultural cooperatives have not only actively prepared fertilizers, seeds, and farm tools, and fattened draft animals, but also sown the first season rice seedlings of double-cropping rice.

    云南农村加紧蓄水和积肥
    本报昆明4日电　云南省为了争取今年更大的丰收，各地在春耕准备工作中，紧紧地抓住兴修中、小型水利和积肥等增产措施。
    全省冬季兴修水利和积肥的工作，都比去年好而多。据五十七个县统计，到目前止，大、小水塘蓄水量已够灌溉二百多万亩土地。曲靖专区各地蓄水量比去年同时期增加，陆良、富源、路南等县比去年增加60％—70％。全省积肥已完成30％—50％。路南县在春节前就完成了所需肥料的70％以上。蒙自专区的建水官厅区在十天内就积肥四百五十万斤。绥江县建设乡农业社一周内积肥四十二万斤。在德宏、西双版纳等地，傣族人民过去没有积肥的习惯，为了争取更大的丰收，他们也积极开辟肥源，展开积肥活动。
    玉溪、宜良、晋宁、路南等县的农业社都认真地进行了小春加工。他们在蚕豆、小麦、菜籽地里施了追肥。季节较早的西双版纳、德宏、红河哈尼族自治州等地，有些农业社除积极准备肥料、籽种、农具、为耕畜催膘等外，已撒下双季稻的第一季稻秧。
