Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi - The various reclamation areas of the Xinjiang Agricultural Production and Construction Corps are stepping up preparations to welcome spring plowing.

　　In order to expand the irrigated area and strive for a bumper harvest this year, various reclamation areas have expanded some reservoirs and canals. After the expansion project of the Daquangou Reservoir was completed not long ago, the storage capacity has been expanded from 3.2 million cubic meters to 40 million cubic meters, and the irrigated area has increased by more than 31,000 mu. An expansion project of a canal in the Yanqi reclamation area, which is under intense construction, is expected to increase the irrigation of 240,000 mu of newly reclaimed land by the end of March.

　　The work of overhauling agricultural machinery and training technical personnel is also being actively carried out in various reclamation areas. After studying, the students of many training classes have been able to initially install, adjust, and use square-hole seeders, and have learned to independently carry out sowing area planning.

　　Various reclamation areas and farms have already formulated this year's production plans for expanding agriculture and animal husbandry. The Ulasu Farm plans to plant a total area of 141,500 mu this year, an increase of 68.33% compared to last year. Among them, the planting area of food crops will increase by 186.5% compared to last year, and the planting area of cotton will increase by 58.75% compared to last year. The animal husbandry plan is to retain the number of heads at the end of the year, with sheep increasing by 12.27% and pigs increasing by 98% compared to last year.

    扩建水库水渠　检修机耕农具
    新疆农业生产部队准备春耕
    据新华社乌鲁木齐电　新疆农业生产建设部队各垦区正在加紧准备迎接春耕。
    为了扩大灌溉面积，争取今年丰收，各垦区扩建了一些水库、水渠。大泉沟水库扩建工程在不久以前完工后，容水量已由三千二百公方扩大到四千万公方，灌溉面积增加了三万一千多亩。正在紧张施工中的焉耆垦区一处水渠扩建工程，预计到3月底，可以增加灌溉新开垦的二十四万亩土地。
    检修机耕农具和训练技术人员的工作，也在各垦区积极进行中。许多训练班的学员们经过学习，已经能够初步安装、调整和使用方形窝播机，并且学会独立地进行播区规划。
    各垦区和农场已经订出今年扩大农牧业的生产计划。乌拉苏农场今年计划种植面积共十四万一千五百亩，比去年扩大68.33％，其中粮食作物种植面积比去年增加186.5％，棉花种植面积比去年增加58.75％。畜牧业计划年终保留头数，羊比去年增加12.27％，猪比去年增加98％。
