Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, February 24th: The Albanian government issued a statement on February 22nd, supporting the Soviet government's recent proposals regarding the issues of peace and security in the Near and Middle East, as put forward in its notes to the United States, Britain, and France.

The statement said that the Soviet government's new proposal is a very important step towards promoting the normalization of the situation in the Near and Middle East, maintaining peace in the region, and easing international tensions. Without a doubt, if the governments of all countries concerned about the situation in the Near and Middle East adopt the Soviet proposal, it will eliminate the dangers that threaten the freedom and independence of the peoples of the Near and Middle Eastern countries and threaten world peace, and will create favorable conditions for the peaceful and independent development of the countries in this region.

The Albanian government's statement condemned the actions of Britain, France, and Israel in worsening the situation in the Near and Middle East, and the Eisenhower Doctrine, which openly interferes in the internal affairs of the countries of the Near and Middle East.
