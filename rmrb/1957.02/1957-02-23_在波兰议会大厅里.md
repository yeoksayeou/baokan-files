In the Polish Parliament Hall
By our correspondent Hu Sisheng

Early spring accompanied February 20th. In the hearts of the Polish people, today is the most important day in February. The parliamentary session scheduled to open today will decide national policies and discuss state affairs. In Poland, which patriotic citizen does not care about national affairs?

On Wiejaska Street in Warsaw stands a huge domed building, which is the Polish People's Republic Parliament. Today, after three o'clock in the afternoon, more and more people are gathering here. In addition to the deputies who arrived one after another, many ordinary citizens wanted to go in and attend as observers. It is said that more than ten thousand people applied to attend as observers, but there are only seven hundred seats in the auditorium.

By nearly four o'clock, the parliament hall was already packed. This is a horseshoe-shaped conference hall with seats arranged in a fan shape. Previously, the deputies' seats were arranged according to regions, but this new parliament is arranged according to party affiliation. Looking from upstairs, the United Workers' Party deputies are sitting on the left, and the Catholic activists are on the far right; in other words, each parliamentary group occupies a territory. The parliamentary group is also a new product after this parliamentary election. A few days before the parliament meeting, the three parties in the parliament established parliamentary groups. The United Workers' Party parliamentary group has two hundred and thirty-six deputies, the United Peasants' Party parliamentary group has one hundred and sixteen deputies, and the Democratic Party parliamentary group has thirty-nine deputies. Each parliamentary group held continuous meetings before the parliament meeting to discuss and decide on the action plan in the parliament. The United Workers' Party parliamentary group was established on February 16th, and Comrade Gomulka talked about the action plan of the United Workers' Party deputies at this meeting. He said, "We are deputies, and we are also members of the United Workers' Party. The reason why we become deputies is because we are party members. Each of us is proposed by the party. The people voted for us because they regard us as representatives of the party. ...The party leadership is not prepared to weaken the initiative of the communist party deputies, on the contrary, it requires the deputies to help the party leadership implement the party's line and participate in the formulation of the party's line." Precisely because of this, considering that the parliament is the supreme organ of state power, the United Workers' Party recently decided to invite all United Workers' Party deputies to attend the plenary session of the Party Central Committee as observers. It is clear that this is a measure taken by the United Workers' Party to strengthen the party's leading role in the parliament.

The time everyone was looking forward to arrived. At four o'clock sharp Warsaw time, the oldest member of parliament, Drobnar, stepped onto the podium. According to custom, the opening ceremony of each parliament should be presided over by the oldest member of parliament. Drobnar is seventy-four years old this year and is a member of the United Workers' Party. He was wearing a black Lenin suit, with gray hair and a beard of the same color. His old age did not diminish his loud and firm voice. In his brief opening remarks, he said: The result of the Polish general election is an expression of the people's support for socialism, which greatly disappointed those abroad who hoped that the general election would weaken the socialist camp. Although the parties in the parliament have different world views, the desire for patriotism, advancing towards socialism, and friendly unity with the Soviet Union and all socialist countries unite us.

After Drobnar announced the opening of the parliament, the new deputies began to take their oath.

"I, a deputy of the Polish People's Republic, solemnly swear: to work for the benefit of the Polish people, to strengthen the unity of the people, to consolidate the state power and the connection between the working people in urban and rural areas, and to contribute all my strength to consolidate the independent sovereignty of the Polish People's Republic and its further prosperity." In the solemn atmosphere of all deputies standing up, Drobnar read out this oath word by word; then when each deputy was called by name according to the alphabetical order of their last name, they loudly repeated the sentence "I swear".

The election of the speaker and deputy speakers was the next item. All the deputies unanimously raised their hands to approve Wiecek (United Peasants' Party) as the speaker, and Klyszko (United Workers' Party) and Jedlowski (Democratic Party) as the deputy speakers.

After the parliament elected the State Council and the Chairman of the Council of Ministers, it announced a temporary adjournment. The adjournment will continue for four days. During these days, the Credentials Committee and the Parliamentary Regulations Drafting Committee will work. At the second meeting, the election of various standing committees of the parliament, the adoption of the candidates for the new government, and hearing the government's policy report will be the most noticeable agenda. In the subsequent meetings, in addition to discussing the government's policy program, economic issues such as the Five-Year Plan, the 1957 National Economic Plan, and the 1957 National Budget will be reviewed and approved; in addition, new decisions will be made on certain legislative issues. It can be seen that the issues that have been discussed and will be discussed in the parliament are all top-priority issues in the life of the Polish state. Solving these problems on the basis of collective wisdom is of great significance to the cause of Polish socialist construction.

According to people familiar with the situation, since Poland currently has considerable economic difficulties, economic issues will be a major task facing the parliament. The Polish News Agency conducted a survey of four hundred and fifty-six deputies on the main tasks of the parliament on the eve of the parliament's opening, and two hundred and fifty-six deputies believed that this parliament should mainly engage in formulating plans to reorganize the national economy, implement the central program of the United Workers' Party and the United Peasants' Party on agricultural issues, and change the way of economic management. In addition, one hundred deputies believed that the parliament should create conditions for solving the national housing problem, especially in large residential areas such as Warsaw, Silesia, and Lodz; eighty-six deputies believed that the parliament should study the issue of consolidating and further developing handicrafts and small-scale production, and using local raw materials to create local industries. Therefore, it can be predicted that the parliament will devote a lot of energy to economic issues.

During the first meeting, when electing the State Council and the Chairman of the Council of Ministers, it was already seen that all the deputies were not unanimous on all issues, and it can be estimated this way in future discussions. It is not surprising that the deputies have different views on certain issues. From the deputies' worldviews, there are both Marxists-Leninists and theists who believe in God. In terms of occupation, there are both representatives of workers and peasants, as well as writers, Catholic activists, and craftsmen. But despite some differences, the vast majority of deputies have the same views on some of the most basic issues of the country. The people elected them as deputies based on this point as well.

The parliament will hold its second meeting at 4:00 p.m. on February 26th. Some people estimate that because the parliament has many issues to discuss, the closing date of the parliament will be in late March. During this month, the parliament's discussions will be the center of Polish attention. (Warsaw, February 21)

### 在波兰议会大厅里

    在波兰议会大厅里
    本报记者　胡思升
    初春伴送着2月20日来到了。在波兰人民的心目中，今天是2月里最重要的日子。定于今天开幕的议会会议，将决定国策和讨论国事。在波兰，哪一个爱国的公民不关心国家大事呢？
    在华沙维斯卡大街旁有一幢圆顶的巨大建筑，这就是波兰人民共和国议会。今天下午三点多钟，向这里聚集的人越来越多了。除了陆续来到的议员外，不少的普通公民都想进去参加旁听。据说要求旁听的人在一万以上，但是旁听席总共仅能容七百人。
    近四点钟时，议会大厅已经挤得满满的。这是一个马蹄形的会议厅，座位排成扇形。以前议员座位是按照地区排列的，这次新议会则是按照党派排列。从楼上望去，统一工人党议员坐在左面，最右面是天主教活动家；换句话说，每个议会党团占据一块地盘。议会党团也是这次议会选举后的新产物。在议会开会前几天，议会中的三个党分别成立了议会党团。统一工人党议会党团有议员二百三十六人，统一农民党议会党团有议员一百一十六人，民主党议会党团有议员三十九人。各议员党团都在议会开会前连续集会，讨论和决定在议会的行动方针。统一工人党议会党团是2月16日成立的，哥穆尔卡同志曾在这次集会上谈到统一工人党议员的行动方针。他说，“我们是议员，我们也是统一工人党党员。我们所以成为议员，是因为我们是党员。我们中的每一个人都是党提出的。人民所以投票选举我们，是因为把我们看作党的代表。……党的领导不准备削弱共产党员议员的主动性，相反地，要求议员帮助党的领导贯彻党的路线和参加制订党的路线。”正因为这样，由于考虑到议会是国家最高权力机关，最近统一工人党决定在党中央举行全体会议时，邀请所有统一工人党议员列席。很清楚，这是统一工人党为了加强党在议会的领导作用而采取的一种措施。
    大家盼望的时间来临了。华沙时间下午四点正，议会最年长的议员德罗布纳走上主席台。按照惯例，每届议会的开幕式都应由最年长的议员主持。德罗布纳今年七十四岁，是统一工人党党员。他穿着一身黑色的列宁服，灰白的头发和同样颜色的胡须。高龄没有减弱他宏亮而坚定的声音。他在简短的开幕词中说：波兰大选的结果是人民拥护社会主义的表示，这使国外那些希望大选会削弱社会主义阵营的人大失所望。议会中各党派虽然世界观不同，但是爱国主义、向社会主义前进和同苏联及一切社会主义国家友好团结等愿望把我们结合在一起。
    在德罗布纳宣布议会开幕后，就开始新议员宣誓的项目。
    “我，波兰人民共和国的议员，庄严地宣誓：为了波兰人民的利益，为了加强人民的团结，为了巩固国家政权同城乡劳动人民的联系而工作，为了巩固波兰人民共和国的独立主权及其进一步的繁荣而贡献一切力量。”在全体议员起立的庄严气氛中，德罗布纳逐字宣读完这篇誓言；然后当每个议员按照其姓氏字母的先后被点到名字时，就大声重复“我宣誓”这句话。
    选举议长和副议长是紧接着的项目。全体议员一致举手通过维策赫（统一农民党）为议长，克利什科（统一工人党）和约德洛夫斯基（民主党）为副议长。
    在议会选出了国务委员会和部长会议主席之后，就宣布暂时休会。休会要继续四天。在这几天里，资格审查委员会和议会条例起草委员会将进行工作。在第二次会议上，选举议会的各种常设委员会，通过新政府的人选，听取政府的施政纲领报告，将是最受人注意的议程。在其后的各次会议上，除了将对政府施政纲领进行讨论外，还将对五年计划、1957年国民经济计划和1957年度国家预算等经济问题，进行审查和通过；此外，在某些立法问题上也将通过新的决定。由此可见，议会上已经讨论和将行讨论的都是波兰国家生活中头等重要的问题。在集思广益的基础上解决这些问题，对于波兰社会主义建设的事业有着重大的意义。
    据熟悉情况的人说，由于波兰目前在经济上有着不小的困难，经济问题将是议会面临的一项主要任务。波兰通讯社在议会开幕前夕曾向四百五十六名议员就议会主要任务问题进行过调查，其中二百五十六名议员认为这届议会主要应从事制订改组国民经济的计划，贯彻统一工人党中央和统一农民党关于农业问题的纲领，和改变经济管理的方式。此外，一百名议员认为，议会应创造解决全国住宅问题的条件，特别是在像华沙、西里西亚和罗兹这些大居民区；八十六名议员认为，议会应研究巩固和进一步发展手工业和小生产、利用地方原料创建地方工业的问题。因此，可以预料，议会在经济问题上将付出不少的精力。
    首次会议在选举国务委员会和部长会议主席时，已经看出全体议员并不是在所有问题上都是一致的，在以后的讨论中也可以这样估计。议员们对某些问题看法的分歧是不奇怪的。从议员的世界观来说，这里既有马列主义者，也有信奉上帝的有神论者，从职业来说，这里既有工人和农民的代表，也有作家、天主教活动家和手工业者。但是尽管有某些分歧，绝大多数议员在国家的一些最基本的问题上是看法一致的。人民所以选举他们为议员，也是根据这一点。
    2月26日下午四时，议会将举行第二次会议。有人估计，由于议会要讨论的问题很多，议会闭幕的日期将在3月下旬。在这一个月的时间里，议会的讨论将是波兰人注意的中心。　（21日于华沙）
