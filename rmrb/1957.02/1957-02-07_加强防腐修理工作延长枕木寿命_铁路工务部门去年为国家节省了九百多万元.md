According to "People's Railway" news: This year, the national railway engineering departments will carry out a large number of anti-corrosion measures on untreated wooden sleepers impregnated with sodium fluoride and repair old sleepers to extend the service life of sleepers and save state funds.

This work is the greatest saving in the work of the engineering departments. Last year alone, the national railway engineering departments applied sodium fluoride preservatives to 3.47 million untreated wooden sleepers on main lines that could still be used for more than two years. Sleepers treated with preservatives can have their service life extended by two years. They also repaired 3.39 million old sleepers using various methods. These old sleepers had cracks, partial decay, and enlarged spike holes. Workers bound sleepers with cracks using iron wire; for partially decayed sleepers, they dug out the decayed parts and inlaid them with good wood to continue using them; sleepers removed from the main lines that could be spliced were spliced and used on station lines; those that could not be spliced were not completely discarded, and the good parts were used as support wood or wooden wedges for spike holes. The parts of the sleepers where spikes are driven are the most prone to decay. For such sleepers, if the decay of the spike hole does not exceed 40 mm, wooden bolts are embedded in the spike hole, or "integral wooden plugs" are embedded to replace the spike hole. The service life of repaired sleepers can be extended by one year. The sleepers on a 900-meter-long curve at Taiyuan West Station of the Taiyuan Railway Bureau are all embedded with wooden bolts, and the quality of the line is still very good.

Implementing anti-corrosion measures for untreated wooden sleepers and repairing old sleepers saves the country a lot of money. In 1955, an average of 148 sleepers were replaced per kilometer on the entire railway. Last year, although the sleeper failure rate continued to increase, only 104 sleepers were replaced per kilometer. Last year, a total of 6.86 million sleepers were used for anti-corrosion and repair, saving the country approximately more than 9 million yuan, excluding the cost of anti-corrosion and repair.

### 加强防腐修理工作延长枕木寿命  铁路工务部门去年为国家节省了九百多万元

    加强防腐修理工作延长枕木寿命
    铁路工务部门去年为国家节省了九百多万元
    据“人民铁道”讯　今年全国铁路工务部门将大量进行铺设中素枕木的防腐和旧枕木修理工作，以延长枕木使用年限，为国家节约资金。
    这项工作是工务部门工作中的最大节约。去年一年，全国铁路工务部门对正线上三百四十七万根还能使用两年以上的素枕木，涂抹了氟化钠防腐剂，涂抹防腐剂的枕木，使用年限能延长两年。还用各种各样方法，修理了三百三十九万根旧枕木。这些旧枕木中，有裂纹、部分腐朽、道钉孔扩大的。职工们把有裂纹的枕木，用铁线捆扎起来；对部分腐朽的枕木，把腐朽部分挖掉，再镶上好的木料，继续使用；从正线上换下来的枕木，凡能拼接使用的，都拼接起来换在站线上使用；对不能拼接的，也不完全作废，将好的部分作成支撑木或是道钉孔木楔。枕木钉道钉的部分，最容易腐朽。对这样的枕木，凡钉孔腐朽不超过四十公厘的，在钉孔中嵌入木螺栓，或嵌入“整体木塞”改换道钉孔。经过修理的枕木，使用寿命都能延长一年。太原局太原西站九百多公尺长的弯道上的枕木，全是嵌木螺栓的，线路质量仍然很好。
    实行素枕木防腐，和对旧枕木进行修理便用，给国家节省很大一笔开支。1955年，全路每公里维修平均抽换一百四十八根枕木，去年虽在枕木失效率不断增加的情况下，每公里只抽换了一百零四根。去年一年，进行防腐和修理使用的枕木共达六百八十六万根，除去防腐、修理的成本费，约为国家节省九百多万元。
