Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, February 1st: The port of Hankou, known as the heart of the Yangtze River route, was as busy as usual during the 24-hour period from 6:00 PM on the 30th to 6:00 PM on the 31st. Staff at the port authority's dispatch office told reporters that 55 ships entered and exited the port during this period, carrying approximately 35,000 tons of various materials and transporting a large number of passengers. To complete the task of receiving and sending off these ships, the entire port authority staff worked diligently and cheerfully throughout the past 24 hours.

At Wharf 10, not far from the Wuhan Customs House, reporters visited the workers on crane barge No. 2. They were unloading a batch of machinery and equipment from barge Shangzi 134 and loading it onto barge Hangzi 2008. Seaman Li Yihe said that they worked until 2:00 AM on the night of the 30th, but everyone started working again at 9:00 AM on the 31st.

To ensure that ships sailed on time, the loading and unloading workers challenged each other in advance, guaranteeing full attendance during the Spring Festival. The workers of the Fourth and Seventh Loading and Unloading Brigades, who were on the day shift on the 31st, even discussed how to complete the loading and unloading work as quickly as possible during lunch and rest breaks. As a result, they overfulfilled their task by 20% and had no cargo discrepancies or damage incidents.

Unloading 4,500 tons of fertilizer

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, January 31st: On "New Year's Eve," the docks of Tianjin New Port were brightly lit, and more than 400 stevedores happily persisted in working all night. At 8:00 AM on "New Year's Day," a new shift took over their work.

Over the past two days, two cargo ships carrying more than 12,000 tons of fertilizer from Antwerp, Belgium, and Fukuoka, Japan, arrived at New Port. To ensure that farmers could use the fertilizer as soon as possible, the stevedores decided to continue working during the Spring Festival. In the evening, the entire New Port was bustling with activity, with each loading and unloading team, mechanical team, and warehouse submitting guarantees to their superiors and launching challenge competitions with each other. In an instant, various loading and unloading machines on the docks and cranes on the ships worked more intensely, and people worked vigorously in the biting cold wind.

Today, as soon as it dawned, a long train full of fertilizer departed from New Port Wharf. From 4:00 PM yesterday to 4:00 PM today, those who persisted in working at New Port loaded and unloaded a total of 4,573 tons of fertilizer, which was transported by train in five separate shipments.

Comrade Postman, You've Worked Hard!

Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, January 31st: Xi'an during the Spring Festival was covered with heavy snow. At 8:40 AM, as people were enjoying their Spring Festival breakfast, postman Sun Manli set off from the Xi'an Post Office in the cold. She gently pushed open the doors of each household, delivering letters and packages to their owners.

Postman Sun Manli joined the workforce only last September. Today was her first Spring Festival on duty, and she did not expect that her work could add to people's joy during the festive Spring Festival, and that people would cherish and respect her labor so much. As soon as she left the post office today, a tricycle with a cloth canopy passed her, and a strange woman leaned out of the car to greet her: "Comrade Postman, you've worked hard!" When she got to her postal route, everyone greeted her: "Happy New Year!" An old lady even gave her a warm bun. But she declined, because today's work was two shifts combined into one, and there was twice as much mail to deliver as usual. The road was so muddy, the wind and snow were so heavy, and there was no time to delay. She wanted to deliver the Spring Festival gifts and good news from afar to their owners as quickly as possible.

On the first day of the Spring Festival, Xi'an citizens received more than 60,000 pieces of mail, which were delivered by 110 postmen in six hours despite the wind and snow.

Busy Medical Workers

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, January 31st: Many medical professors, doctors, nurses, and administrative staff in Shenyang voluntarily requested to continue working as usual during the Spring Festival.

Since the beginning of winter, the incidence of measles in various parts of Liaoning Province has been increasing, and government departments have strengthened measures to prevent the spread of measles. The Measles Pneumonia Research Group of Shenyang Medical College has begun further research on the pathological changes of measles pneumonia, identifying the factors of the disease, and studying clinical efficacy to control the epidemic of measles and pneumonia in children. Professors said that they would not rest during the Spring Festival or winter vacation. Eight medical students from the Liaoning Provincial Health School, who are interning at the Second Hospital of Shenyang City, will not go home during the Spring Festival and will live in the hospital to support the pediatrics department. The hospital's administrative leaders and head nurses will also participate in general duty and treatment work. All internal medicine doctors and pediatric medical and nursing staff of the Fifth Hospital have guaranteed that all patients who come will receive timely treatment. Many cadres of the Shenyang Municipal Health Bureau have also requested not to rest during the Spring Festival holiday and to go deep into various medical units to help with their work.

Busy Flights in the Vast Sky

Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Early on the morning of the first day of the new year, before dawn, the sound of rumbling was heard from the Beijing West Suburb Airport, and preparations for the take-off of the plane began.

The navigation room is where pilots prepare for flights. The captain of aircraft "614," Xu Boling, studied and checked the status of all pre-flight preparations with the co-pilot and radio operator. This young captain, who has already flown safely for more than 2,000 hours, had just flown back to Beijing from Hanoi, Vietnam, yesterday afternoon, and today he is flying to Irkutsk, Soviet Union.

Xu Boling's newlywed wife, Li Qingzhi, also rushed to work at the inquiry office of the business office early in the morning. She constantly answered people's telephone and verbal inquiries, and she also held a leather coat, needle, thread, and buttons in her hand, sewing two stitches whenever she had time. Someone asked her whose coat this was. Li Qingzhi's face flushed, and she said shyly: It's cold on the Irkutsk side, and you can't do without a leather coat!

At 8:40 AM, Xu Boling bid farewell to those who came to see him off and boarded aircraft "614" and took off. People waved to Xu Boling and his assistants and wished them: Safe journey!

    为国家增加财富　为人民增添幸福
    在春节期间坚持工作的人们
    汉口港一昼夜
    新华社武汉1日电　从30日下午六点到31日下午六点的这一昼夜里，被称作长江航线心脏的汉口港同平时一样繁忙。港务局调度室的工作人员告诉记者说，在这一昼夜，全港进出口的船只有五十五只，它们载进和载出的各种物资约有三万五千吨，并且运送了大批旅客。整个港务局的职工为了完成接送这些船只的任务，在过去的这一昼夜内进行了紧张而愉快的劳动。
    在离武汉关不远的十码头，记者访问了二号起重吊船的职工们。他们正在把一批机器设备从上字一三四号驳船上卸下来，再装到航字二○○八号驳船上去。水手长李义和说，30日夜里，他们工作到半夜后两点钟才下班，但到31日早晨九点钟，大家又开始工作了。
    为了保证船只按时开航，装卸职工事前纷纷挑战，互相保证春节全勤。31日担任白班的第四和第七装卸大队的工人们，甚至在中午吃饭、休息时，也在商量怎样尽快地完成装卸工作。因此，他们超额20％完成了任务，并且没有出货差货损事故。装卸四千五百吨肥田粉
    据新华社天津31日电　“除夕”的夜晚，天津新港的码头上灯火通明，四百多个装卸工人兴高采烈地坚持了一个通宵的工作。“大年初一”的早上八点钟，新的一班又接替了他们的工作。
    前、昨两天，从比利时的安特卫普和日本福冈载运着一万二千多吨肥田粉的两艘货轮来到新港。装卸工人们为了让农民早日使用上这些肥料，决定春节继续工作。入晚，整个新港都欢腾起来了，每一个装卸队、机械队和仓库都向领导上提出保证，并且相互展开了挑战竞赛。刹时间，码头上各种装卸机械和船上的吊车都加紧地活动起来，人们在刺骨的寒风中起劲地工作着。
    今天天刚发白，满载着肥田粉的长长的一列火车，从新港码头驶出，从昨天十六时到今天十六时一昼夜里，在新港坚持工作的人们，一共装卸了四千五百七十三吨肥田粉，用火车先后输送了五次。
    邮递员同志，你辛苦了
    据新华社西安31日电　春节的西安，满天上漫飞着鹅毛大雪。上午八时四十分，当人们正在愉快地吃着春节早餐的时候，邮递员孙曼俪便从西安邮局冒着寒冷出发了。她轻轻地推开一家家的大门，把信件和邮包送到主人们的手里。
    邮递员孙曼俪是去年9月才参加工作的。今天是她第一次春节出勤，她想不到自己的工作能给人们在欢乐的春节里更加增添一份高兴；而人们竟是这样爱惜和尊重她的劳动。今天从邮局一出门，一辆盖着布棚的三轮车从她身旁经过，一位陌生的女同志从车里探身出来向她招呼：“邮递员同志，你辛苦了！”到了自己的邮段上，碰到的人都招呼她：“年过得好啊！”有一位老太太甚至还送给她一个热包子。但是她谢绝了，因为今天的工作是两班并作一班，要递送的邮件比往常多了一倍。道路这么泥泞，风雪这么大，时间一点也不能耽搁，她要用最快的速度把从远方寄来的春节礼物和喜信送给主人。
    西安市民在春节的第一天便接到了六万多份邮件，这是一百一十名邮递员在六个小时内冒着风雪分别送到的。
    忙碌的医务工作者
    新华社沈阳31日电　沈阳市很多医学教授、医生、护士和行政人员，自动要求春节照常坚持工作。
    入冬以来，辽宁省各地麻疹疫情日渐上升，政府各部门加强了防治麻疹蔓延的措施。沈阳医学院麻疹肺炎研究小组，已经开始进一步研究麻疹肺炎的病理变化，鉴定得病的因素，研究临床疗效，以控制小儿麻疹、肺炎的流行。教授们表示春节、寒假都不休息。在沈阳市第二医院实习的辽宁省卫生学校的八名医士，春节也不回家，将住在医院里支援小儿科工作。医院的行政领导和护士长，也都参加总值班和治疗工作。第五医院的全体内科医生、小儿科医疗护理人员都保证要使来的病人都能及时得到治疗。沈阳市卫生局很多干部，也要求在春节假期不休息，深入各医疗单位帮助工作。
    万里长空飞行忙
    据新华社讯　初一早晨，天还没有亮，北京西郊飞机场上就传出了一片隆隆的响声，飞机起飞前的准备工作开始了。
    领航室是飞行员们进行飞行准备工作的地方。“六一四”号飞机机长徐柏龄，在这里同副驾驶员、报务员们研究并检查飞行前一切准备工作的情况。这位已经安全飞行了两千多小时的年轻机长，昨天下午刚从越南的河内飞回北京，今天又要飞往苏联的伊尔库次克去了。
    徐柏龄的新婚妻子李清之，一早也赶到商务室的问讯处来上班。她不时回答着人们的电话和口头的询问，手里还拿着一件皮大衣和针、线、钮扣，一有空就钉上两针。有人问她这是谁的大衣？李清之满脸腓红，不好意思地说：伊尔库次克那边冷，不穿皮大衣不行哪！
    八点四十分，徐柏龄告别了送行的人们，登上“六一四”号飞机起飞了。人们向徐柏龄和他的助手们挥手祝福：一路平安！
