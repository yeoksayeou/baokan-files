New Avenues for Woodware Production
    Sun Guang

    Not long ago, some chairs, stools, and toddler beds made from wooden strips appeared on the Beijing market. They were both attractive and inexpensive, and sold quickly. These were products of the Beijing Woodware Production Cooperative.

    A few days ago, I visited the Beijing No. 8 Woodware Production Cooperative. This is a relatively old cooperative. Most of the wood they use is of second, third, fourth, and off-grade quality. There are many pieces with knots and cracks, so making good finished products that maximize the effectiveness of these materials is really not easy. However, under the call for saving materials, the members of this cooperative have been actively using their brains to find ways to utilize these fragmented "knotty wood" and cracked materials, which used to be considered "waste." After a batch of wood is sent from the kiln drying department to the sawing room, the sawing workers first saw the whole boards into sections, then into thin strips, and the edges are sawn into even smaller strips, so that each piece of whole material can be fully utilized, leaving only scattered firewood. The members are unwilling to easily give up even these leftover firewood pieces. They often go to the firewood pile to look for slightly larger pieces of wood to make small and delicate products.

    In the past, many furniture-making units in Beijing often sold leftover scrap wood as firewood. In the second half of last year, the Beijing No. 4 Woodware Production Cooperative had an accumulated scrap wood inventory equivalent to more than 270 cubic meters of finished lumber, tying up more than 40,000 yuan in capital. At that time, the members came up with many ways to utilize the scrap material, piecing together different sizes of scrap wood strips into attractive patterns to make chair seats, toddler beds, or single bed boards, and children's cars. Some of the furniture made from these scrap materials is more durable than those made from whole materials; and the price is also cheaper, with a boxed single bed being about ten yuan cheaper. Last year alone, they utilized scrap wood equivalent to more than 1,230 cubic meters of finished lumber, making more than 66,500 pieces of strip chairs, strip stools, and toddler beds. Among them, the No. 4 Woodware Production Cooperative made more than 11,700 pieces, worth more than 60,000 yuan. The No. 8 Woodware Production Cooperative made more than 4,000 pieces, using 80 cubic meters less of finished lumber.

    Recently, the Beijing Woodware Furniture Production Cooperative Federation organized a technical team to specifically review and revise blueprints. Where large materials are not necessary, they are not used; where small materials can be used, they are used. In the past, many of the furniture sold on the Beijing market used more materials and were bulky in style. Tables are not usually moved, but they were fitted with four thick and large legs; if the style of a household wardrobe is modified, the base alone can save 9.7 "cai" of wood (one cubic meter equals 300 "cai"). Based on the revised blueprints, they have already trial-produced 64 products. These new products can save a lot of wood while ensuring quality, and the style is also very beautiful. If this method can be widely promoted in various cooperatives, these 64 products alone can save more than 2,000 cubic meters of wood a year, which can be used to make 28,000 three-drawer desks. In this way, the woodware production cooperatives not only fully utilize materials but also opened up a path for more rational utilization of wood.

    Since the second half of last year, there has been a shortage of wood supply, and the demand for furniture is very high. At the same time, after some woodware handicraftsmen were organized, they neglected repair services for a while, and citizens could not find places to repair their broken furniture. The woodware production cooperatives studied this situation and found another way to save wood: developing repair and fitting services. All woodware production cooperatives with storefronts also operate old furniture repair services. Recently, they also sent six people specifically carrying boxes to go down the streets and alleys to repair furniture in residents' homes. The members of the No. 5 Woodware Production Cooperative who went down the street earned only 70 cents on the first day, but earned more than three yuan on the third day. This business has only just begun and is already overwhelmed. They plan to add some more members to do mobile repair services, and also plan to buy old furniture, repair it, and sell it at a low price, in order to reduce the number of new furniture purchases by residents and save wood for the country.

    木器生产的新门路
    孙光
    不久以前，北京市场上出现了一些用木头条拼起来的椅子、凳子和幼儿床，又好看，又便宜。销售得很快。这是北京市木器生产合作社的产品。
    前几天，我访问了北京市第八木器生产合作社。这是一个比较老的社。他们使用的木材多数是二、三、四等和等外材，有栉子、有裂缝的木材较多，要想使这些材料发挥最大的效能，做出较好的成品，可真是一件不容易的事情。但是，这个社的社员在节约用材的号召下，积极开动脑筋，把这些零零碎碎、过去当成“废料”的“栉子木”、裂缝材都想法利用上了。当一批木料从烤料部送到锯房以后，锯房工人先把整板锯成一段一段的，然后再变成细条，边料再锯成更小的板条，使每一块整料都能充分利用，最后剩下的只是零碎的劈柴。社员们对这些剩下的劈柴，也不肯轻易放过，他们常常到劈柴堆里去寻找稍大一点的木片，用来制造小巧的产品。
    过去北京市的许多做家具的单位，经常把剩下来的碎木料当劈柴卖掉。前年下半年北京市第四木器生产合作社，一次积存碎木材折合成材二百七十多立方公尺，积压资金四万多元。当时社员们研究出许多利用碎料的办法。把不同大小的碎木条拼成很好看的花纹，做成椅子面、幼儿床或者单人床的床板、小孩车等。这种用碎料做成的家具，有的比整材做的还耐用；价钱又便宜，一张包箱单人床就便宜十元左右。去年一年，他们利用的碎木料折合成材一千二百三十多立方公尺。做出条椅、条凳和幼儿床六万六千五百多件。其中第四木器生产合作社就做了一万一千七百多件，价值六万多元。第八木器生产合作社做了四千多件，少用了八十多立方公尺的成材。
    最近，北京市木器家具生产合作社联合社组织了一个技术小组，专门审查和修改图纸。不必要用大料的地方，就不用大料；能用小料的地方，就用小料。过去北京市场上出售的家具，很多都用料较多，式样粗笨。桌子本来是不常移动的，可是都按上了四条又粗又大的腿；做一个家庭用的衣柜，如果修改一下式样，光底座就能节省木料九才七（一立方公尺等于三百才）。根据修改了的图纸，他们已经试制了六十四件产品。这种新产品，在保证质量的前提下，能够节省很多木料，式样也很美观。这种办法如果能在各社普遍推广，单是这六十四种产品，一年就可以节约两千多立方公尺木材，这些木材可以做成三屉桌二万八千张。就这样，木器生产合作社不但充分利用了材料，并且为更加合理地利用木材开辟了一个门路。
    去年下半年以来，木材供应不足，家具需要量很大，同时，有些木器手工业者组织起来以后，一度忽视修理业务，市民有些家具坏了找不到地方修理。木器生产合作社研究了这个情况，又找到了另一个节约木材的办法：开展修配业务。各个木器生产合作社，凡是有门市部的，都兼营修理旧家具。最近，他们还派出六个人专门背着箱子下街串胡同，到住户家里去修理。第五木器生产合作社下街的社员，第一天只赚到七角钱，第三天就赚了三元多。这个业务，仅仅开始，已经忙不过来。他们准备再增加一些社员作流动修理业务，并准备收买旧家具，修理后廉价出售，这样来减少居民购买新家具的数量，为国家节约木材。
