Gaza Strip

Located in the northeastern corner of Egypt's Sinai Peninsula, bordering the Mediterranean Sea, is a narrow strip of land known as the Gaza Strip. The Gaza Strip has a total area of approximately one hundred square miles. Important cities include Gaza and Rafah. According to the Associated Press, it has a population of about 300,000 Arab residents, of whom more than 200,000 are Arab refugees driven out of various parts of Palestine by Israel.

Before World War II, the Gaza Strip was part of the British Mandate of Palestine. At that time, Palestine was inhabited by both Jewish and Arab peoples. Both groups were oppressed by the British colonialists, but, incited by the colonialists, they often had ethnic disputes.

On November 29, 1947, the United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution to "end the mandate and partition Palestine into Arab and Jewish states." The resolution stipulated that the mandate over Palestine should end on May 1, 1948, and the forces of the mandatory power, Great Britain, should withdraw from May 1, 1948; from May 1, 1948, to July 1, 1948, two states, one Arab and one Jewish, should be established in Palestine. According to the UN partition plan, the Gaza Strip was to belong to the Arab state. On May 14, 1948, the Jewish people established the State of Israel. Incited and instigated by the imperialists, Israel and the Arab countries broke out into a bloody war on May 15, 1948. On February 24, 1949, Egypt and Israel signed an armistice agreement. Articles 6 and 7 of the agreement stipulated that the area from Rafah to Gaza City, namely the Gaza Strip, would fall under the jurisdiction of Egyptian sovereignty. Therefore, the Gaza Strip not only has a long history of close ties with Egypt, but today is also an inseparable part of Egyptian territory.

In late October 1956, Britain and France colluded with Israel to launch a brazen war of aggression against Egypt. Israeli troops occupied Egypt's Sinai Peninsula and the Gaza Strip. The Anglo-French and Israeli aggression was severely condemned throughout the world. The United Nations General Assembly passed several resolutions calling for the withdrawal of Anglo-French troops from Egypt and the withdrawal of Israeli troops behind the 1949 armistice line. However, after the Anglo-French invading forces were forced to withdraw from Port Said, Israel, with the support of the United States, Britain, and France, three Western colonial powers, repeatedly delayed the withdrawal of its troops and blatantly refused to return the Gaza Strip to Egypt.

The US, Britain, and France support Israel's delay in withdrawing troops in an attempt to use it to exert pressure on Egypt, in order to realize the Western colonial powers' "international co-management plan" for the Suez Canal and the "Eisenhower Doctrine" invasion plan for the Middle East.

### 加沙地带

    加沙地带
    在埃及西奈半岛的东北角，濒地中海，有一片狭长地区，这就是加沙地带。加沙地带的全部面积约一百多平方英里。重要城市有加沙和拉法。据美联社说，这里约有三十万阿拉伯居民，其中二十多万是被以色列从巴勒斯坦各地赶出来的阿拉伯难民。
    在第二次世界大战以前，加沙地带是巴勒斯坦英国委任统治地的一部分。当时巴勒斯坦是犹太民族和阿拉伯民族混居的地方，两族居民同样受着英国殖民者的压迫，但在殖民者的挑拨下，他们经常发生民族纠纷。
    1947年11月29日联合国大会通过了“结束委任统治，阿拉伯、犹太两族分治”的决议，决议规定：巴勒斯坦的委任统治应于1948年5月1日结束，委任统治国——英国的武力应于1948年5月1日起撤退；自1948年5月1日至7月1日应在巴勒斯坦建立阿拉伯人和犹太人的两个国家。按照联合国的分治计划，加沙地带就是属于这个阿拉伯国家的。1948年5月14日，犹太人成立了以色列国。在帝国主义的挑拨和煽动之下，以色列和阿拉伯各国于1948年5月15日爆发了流血战争。1949年2月24日，埃及和以色列签订了停战协定，协定的第六、七条规定，从拉法到加沙城这一地区，即加沙地带，属于埃及主权的管辖范围。因此，加沙地带不仅在历史上同埃及有很大渊源，而且今天已经是埃及领土不可分割的一部分。
    1956年10月底，英法勾结以色列悍然发动了对埃及的侵略战争，以色列军队侵占了埃及的西奈半岛和加沙地带。英法和以色列的侵略行为遭到了全世界的严厉谴责。联合国大会几次通过决议，要英法军队撤出埃及和以色列军队撤回到1949年停战线后面。可是，在英法侵略军被迫撤出塞得港后，以色列在美英法三个西方殖民国家支持之下，一再拖延撤军，公然拒绝把加沙地带归还埃及。
    美英法支持以色列拖延撤军，是企图利用它对埃及施加压力，以实现西方殖民国家对苏伊士运河的“国际共管计划”和“艾森豪威尔主义”侵略中东计划。
