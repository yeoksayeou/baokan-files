    To An Old Communist Party Member
    Yang Ye
    The fields are covered with a light frost,
    Yet you still wade barefoot,
  (Your lame foot like a gnarled, dark tree root)
    Through the cold mud to cut rice.
    I am ashamed—
    Having walked a little further in the countryside,
    Before even getting blisters,
    I grumble that I can't take it.
    You are sixty-two years old this year,
    But you work harder than the young adults,
    Earning a full twelve hundred work points in the commune.
    But there are people like this—
    Who, for just a slight case of insomnia,
    Frown and look miserable,
    And rest for more than sixty days.
    You treasure the Party flag you swore your oath on twenty years ago,
    Burning here is your heart of a loyal son to the Party.
    But some people have been in the Party for only two years,
    And already feel that everything is stale,
    The Party's earnest teachings,
    Like chewing a tasteless olive.
    You have endured countless hardships for the revolution,
    And are still covered with scars,
    Yet you often say about yourself:
    That you haven’t contributed much to the Party.
    But some people have only been in the army for seven years,
    And already complain that they aren’t being promoted fast enough.
    As if the state owes them a debt
    That can never be repaid.
              January 1957, Hangzhou

    给一位老共产党员
    杨野
    田野蒙上了薄霜，
    你依然赤着双脚，
  （跛脚像乌黑的树根）
    踏着冰冷的泥浆割稻。
    我羞惭——
    下乡多走了点路，
    还没有磨起水泡，
    就唠叨着受不了。
    你今年六十二岁，
    干活却不让壮年人，
    在社里整整做了一千二百个工分。
    可是有这样的人呢——
    只不过轻微的失眠，
    就愁眉苦脸地
    休息了六十多天。
    你珍宝般地藏着二十年前宣誓用的党旗，
    这里燃烧着一颗你对党的赤子之心。
    可是有人入党不过两年，
    就觉得一切都不新鲜，
    对党的谆谆教导，
    如同嚼一颗失味的橄榄。
    你为革命受过千难万险，
    至今满身烙痕斑斑，
    你却常常说自己：
    对党没有多大贡献。
    可是有人入伍刚刚七年，
    就抱怨提拔得慢。
    好像国家欠他一笔
    永难还清的债款。
              1957年1月于杭州
