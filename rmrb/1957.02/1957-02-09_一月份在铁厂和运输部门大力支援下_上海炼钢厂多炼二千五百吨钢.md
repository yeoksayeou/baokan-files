Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 8th. On the morning of the 7th, a scene of intense loading and unloading appeared at Huangpu Wharf in Shanghai. Dockworkers and transportation workers braved the wind and snow, quickly moving chunks of pig iron onto trucks bound for Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant.

When they delivered the first batch of pig iron to the factory, there were only four hours left before the two steelmaking converters would have to shut down due to lack of materials.

For the first thirty-odd days of this year, all steelmaking furnaces in Shanghai's iron and steel industry frequently faced difficulties in raw material supply. However, with the strong support of Ma'anshan Ironworks and the transportation departments, there was not a single minute of shutdown due to lack of materials. In January, Shanghai factories not only avoided shutdowns, but also produced more than 2,500 tons of steel than planned.

    一月份在铁厂和运输部门大力支援下
    上海炼钢厂多炼二千五百吨钢
    新华社上海8日电　7日早晨在上海的黄浦码头上，出现了一个紧张卸运的场面。码头工人和运输工人们冒着风雪，把一块块的生铁迅速地搬上卡车运往上海第一钢厂。
    当他们把第一批生铁送到工厂的时候，距离两座炼钢转炉断料停炉的时间只有四个小时。
    上海钢铁工业所有的炼钢炉在今年前三十几天里，经常面临着原料供应的困难。但是在马鞍山铁厂和运输部门的大力支援下，从没有断料停炉一分钟。1月份上海各厂不仅没有断料停炉，还比计划多炼出了二千五百多吨钢。
