Xinhua News Agency, February 2nd, report from TASS: The Moscow Oblast Soviet and the Moscow Oblast Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union held a ceremony on February 1st in the Hall of Columns of the Trade Union Building in Moscow to award the Order of Lenin to Moscow Oblast, in recognition of its great achievements in developing agriculture. Currently, Moscow Oblast ranks first in the Russian Federation and in the entire Soviet Union in terms of animal husbandry; and it has also made great achievements in potato and vegetable production. The wealth of collective farms and the profits of state farms have greatly increased. Last year, the income of collective farms in the state exceeded one billion rubles. The average daily pay of collective farmers has increased several times.

Voroshilov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, presented the Order of Lenin to Moscow Oblast on behalf of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union.

Voroshilov said that the remarkable achievements of the Soviet people in developing industry and agriculture have made the Soviet Union stronger, providing the possibility for more rapidly realizing the resolutions of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union regarding further improving the material and cultural living standards of the Soviet people. As everyone knows, these achievements have infuriated the imperialists. However, no matter how furious our enemies are, no matter what tricks they play, the socialist camp demonstrates an indestructible force of unity and the ability to restrain the imperialists and avoid a new world war. Our future task remains to spare no effort to consolidate the strength of our motherland and wage an unremitting struggle for world peace.

Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, also delivered a speech, which was warmly welcomed by the attendees.

    在发展农业方面获得巨大成就

    据新华社2日讯　据塔斯社报道：莫斯科州苏维埃和苏联共产党莫斯科州委员会2月1日在莫斯科工会大厦圆柱大厅举行了莫斯科州荣获列宁勋章的授勋大会。
    苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席伏罗希洛夫代表苏联最高苏维埃主席团把列宁勋章授给莫斯科州，以奖励它在发展农业方面的巨大成就。目前，莫斯科州在畜牧业方面，在俄罗斯联邦、在全苏联都居于前列地位；而在马铃薯和蔬菜生产方面的成就也很大。集体农庄的财富和国营农场的盈利大大增加，去年州内各集体农庄的收入超过十亿卢布。集体农民的劳动日报酬平均提高了几倍。
    伏罗希洛夫说，苏联人民在发展工农业方面所取得的显著成就使得苏联更加强大，为更迅速地实现苏联共产党第二十次代表大会关于进一步提高苏联人民物质和文化生活水平的决议提供了可能。大家知道，这些成就使帝国主义者十分愤怒。但是，不管我们的敌人多么狂暴，不管他们玩弄什么鬼计，社会主义阵营国家显示了不可摧毁的团结力量，和约束帝国主义者、避免新的世界战争的能力。我们今后面临的任务仍是竭力巩固我们祖国的力量、为争取世界和平进行不倦的斗争。
    苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记赫鲁晓夫也发表了演说，他的演说受到了到会者的热烈欢迎。
