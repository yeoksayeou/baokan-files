Construction Dynamics

    Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, February 20th: The Yuxikou Port construction project, China's first newly built modern inland river port, has been largely completed. The largest wharf in the port area, the coal loading wharf, as well as passenger, freight, and timber wharves, have all been built. Railway spurs and substation projects leading to the coal loading wharf and timber wharf are being stepped up.
    Yuxikou Port was designed and built by China itself. Soviet experts provided specific guidance and assistance in the selection of the port site and during construction. The port construction project officially commenced in December 1955. The workers participating in the port construction came from Shanghai, Hankou, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Qingdao, and other places, and received support from many local laborers within the province. Over the past year, in the course of construction, more than three thousand builders displayed a high degree of enthusiasm and creativity, extensively carried out socialist emulation, and greatly improved work efficiency, saving the country a total of 473,000 yuan last year.
    After the completion of Yuxikou Port, a large amount of coal produced by the Huainan Coal Mine can be shipped out from here to cities such as Shanghai, Nanjing, and Huangshi. This will greatly alleviate the transportation burden on the southern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway.

    裕溪口建港工程大部完工
    新华社合肥20日电　我国新建的第一座现代化的内河港口——裕溪口港建港工程，已经大部完工。港区内最大的码头装煤码头，以及客运、货运和木材码头，都已经建成。通往装煤码头和木材码头的铁路支线和变电工程，正在加紧进行。
    裕溪口港是我国自己设计、自己建造的。在选择港址和施工当中，都得到了苏联专家的具体指导和帮助。建港工程在1955年12月正式动工，参加建港的工人来自上海、汉口、天津、广州、青岛等地，并且得到省内许多民工的支援。一年多来，在施工过程中，三千多名建设者发挥了高度的积极性和创造性，广泛地开展了社会主义竞赛，大大提高了工作效率，去年共为国家节约四十七万三千元。
    裕溪口港建成以后，淮南煤矿生产的大量煤炭，大部分可以从这里用船运出，送到上海、南京、黄石等市。这将大大减轻津浦铁路南段运输的负担。
