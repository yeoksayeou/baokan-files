Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 10th: Ajoy Ghosh, General Secretary of the Indian Communist Party, said in Lucknow on the 8th that the Indian Communist Party firmly adheres to Marxism-Leninism, which still holds great significance and vitality for India and all capitalist countries.

Ghosh said at a press conference: It is not Marxism-Leninism that is outdated, but capitalism. Of course, the conditions and requirements of each country should be considered. He added that, due to these adjustments, the Indian Communist Party is a truly Indian political party.

Ghosh estimated that the hope for the strengthening of opposition forces in the upcoming election appears better than before, and the position of the Indian Communist Party will be greatly improved. He said that today the Indian Communist Party is better organized, and the number of Communist Party members has increased from 50,000 in the last election to the current 125,000. The Communist Party has put forward more candidates this time than last time. It will contest 700 to 750 seats in state legislative assemblies and 140 seats in the National Assembly. Currently, the Communist Party and its allied parties hold 200 seats in state legislative assemblies and 30 seats in the National Assembly.

The latest issue of the "New Age" weekly published Ghosh's remarks to reporters after the end of his campaign trip to West Bengal, Assam, Manipur, Tripura, and Bihar. When Ghosh talked about his impressions, he said: Today, the level of political awareness of the Indian people is much higher than it was five years ago during the last general election. He predicted that the number of voters this time, if not more than last time, will also be very large. Ghosh also said: "The people have a huge interest in policy issues related to national construction"; and "the understanding that this country can only be built through socialism seems to be dominant. It is precisely because of this that every party uses the word 'socialism' when addressing voters."

Ghosh further pointed out that the people also want to know what each political party supports and raise political questions. He said: Among the states he visited, the Communist Party is a major party only in West Bengal. However, he found that even in those states where the Indian Communist Party is weak, the people see the Communist Party as the actual leader of the opposition. He "noticed that the people are very eager to know what the Communist Party stands for."

He said that the people raised the same questions that the Communist Party had raised in the past, namely, the need to change government policies, the need for a strong opposition party, and the urgent need for democratic parties to unite to form a strong opposition party.

Ghosh also mentioned that this time the Congress Party is using government institutions more blatantly than last time, and the Congress Party has ample funds. The Communist Party and its hard-working cadres are facing serious financial difficulties. Independent candidates, unless they receive the support of left-wing parties, will probably lose more seats in the upcoming election.

### 印共总书记高士谈印度大选  党员达十二万五千人　候选人多于上次大选

    印共总书记高士谈印度大选
    党员达十二万五千人　候选人多于上次大选
    新华社新德里10日电　印度共产党总书记高士8日在勒克瑙说，印度共产党坚决遵循马克思列宁主义，马克思列宁主义对印度以及一切资本主义国家仍旧有重大意义和生命力。
    高士在记者招待会上说：过时的不是马克思列宁主义，而是资本主义。当然应当考虑每个国家的条件和要求。他又说，由于进行了这些调整，所以印度共产党是真正的印度政党。
    高士估计，在即将举行的选举中，反对党力量加强的希望看来比以前良好，印度共产党的地位将大大改善。他说，今天印度共产党组织更加健全，共产党员已经从上届选举时的五万人增加到目前的十二万五千人。这次共产党提出的候选人比上次为多。它将竞选七百到七百五十个邦立法议会议席和一百四十个国会议席。目前，共产党和同它联盟的各党在邦立法议会中有二百席，在国会中有三十席。
    最近一期的“新世纪”周报登载了高士在到西孟加拉、阿萨姆、曼尼普尔、特里普拉和比哈尔的竞选旅行结束之后对记者发表的谈话。高士谈到他的感想的时候说：今天印度人民政治觉悟的水平比五年前上一次大选时要高得多。他预计这一次投票人数如果不比上一次更多的话，也将是很多的。高士又说：“人民对于同国家建设有关的政策问题有巨大的兴趣”；而且“认为只有通过社会主义才能够建设这个国家，这种认识看来似乎占优势。正是因为这样，每个党在向选民发表演说的时候都使用‘社会主义’这个字眼。”
    高士进一步指出，人民还想知道各个政党拥护些什么，并且提出政治问题。他说：在他到过的那些邦当中，只有在西孟加拉，共产党是大党。然而，他发现即使在印度共产党力量薄弱的那些邦，人民也是把共产党看作是反对党的实际领袖。他“注意到人民很想知道共产党拥护什么”。
    他说，人民提出了共产党过去提出过的问题，那就是，需要改变政府的政策，需要强大的反对党，各民主党派迫切需要团结起来组成强大的反对党。
    高士还谈到：这一次国大党比上一次更加露骨地利用政府机构，国大党的经费很充裕。而共产党同它的艰苦工作的干部在财政上遭到严重的困难。无党无派人士除非得到左翼政党的支持，否则在即将举行的选举中大概会失去更多的席位。
