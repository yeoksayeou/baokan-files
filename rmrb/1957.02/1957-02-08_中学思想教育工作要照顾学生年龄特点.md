Middle school ideological education work should raise students' political awareness and cultivate in them excellent qualities of serving the people wholeheartedly. Middle school ideological education should be based on the students' actual ideological situation, taking into account their age characteristics, and paying attention to working methods in order to achieve better results.

The target of middle school ideological education work is adolescents (generally aged from twelve to eighteen). They are neither children nor adults, and they have the characteristics of their own age group. For middle school ideological education work, attention should be paid to two issues: One is that middle school students live and grow up in a real society, and are influenced by the Party's nurturing education on the one hand, and by the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideology of the family or society on the other. Therefore, schools must carry out political and ideological education for students, struggle against the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideology, and help young people get rid of and resist these harmful ideological influences. The other issue is that adolescents are in the most intense period of physiological development and psychological changes. They are enthusiastic, energetic, and eager for independent life. They want to be adults and hope that others will recognize them as adults. Some characteristics of adults begin to form in them, but at the same time, they have obvious childish characteristics. They lack knowledge, life experience, and self-control, and they lack the ability to distinguish right from wrong in the face of complex things. Their ways of thinking are easily one-sided and extreme. During this period, adolescents are in great need of reasonable guidance and education. Therefore, educational work is of particular importance to adolescents. The reason why education and youth work have emerged as two separate undertakings in human society is precisely because young people need guidance and education.

Some shortcomings and mistakes in the ideological understanding and character of young people are the result of being influenced by the ideology of the exploiting classes and small producers, as well as a lack of knowledge and experience and a failure to receive reasonable education. Under normal circumstances, the reason why young people have poor character often stems from ignorance and less influence from the ideology of the exploiting classes; older young people have more knowledge, but they are also more easily influenced by the ideology of the exploiting classes. This is a general situation, and each student naturally has his or her own specific situation. Educators should adopt a specific analysis attitude towards students' ideological errors, find out the specific reasons for the errors, and then solve them reasonably. At present, in middle school ideological education work, some comrades often fail to specifically analyze the reasons for the shortcomings of young people, and generally believe that they are manifestations of the ideology of the exploiting classes. Therefore, the methods they adopt to solve problems are often generalized or even crude.

In real life, there are many complex reasons for the shortcomings of young people. Educators should make specific analyses of specific people and specific problems, and should not deal with them in a simple way. For middle school students' political and ideological education, the principle of positive and active guidance should be followed in terms of methods. More promotion should be given to lively, knowledgeable, and practical activities such as theme meetings, extracurricular reading, public welfare labor, contact with factories and rural areas, and extracurricular research groups. Young people are energetic, have a wide range of interests, and are very willing to participate in various extracurricular activities. Rich and colorful extracurricular activities are an effective way to help young people come into contact with social life, cultivate new moral qualities in young people, and expand their fields of knowledge by guiding them according to circumstances. This has been repeatedly proven by many successful experiences over the past few years.

Advanced figures and advanced deeds have a strong infectious power for middle school students. The heroic deeds of Liu Hulan, Dong Cunrui, Ding Youjun, Huang Jiguang, and others will forever stir the conscience of young people. Under the call of heroes, millions of young people are determined to learn from the example of heroes and be good sons and daughters worthy of the motherland. Educators should understand this feeling of young people, consciously set examples among students, often explain the stories of the struggles of revolutionary martyrs to students, guide students to read biographies of revolutionary leaders and martyrs, watch dramas and movies about revolutionary history, and hold commemorative meetings for revolutionary festivals. In daily life, we should also often praise and reward the good performances of individual students and student collectives in various aspects, set concrete good examples, and encourage students to be motivated and form a good atmosphere. Educators should be good at discovering the strengths of students and using the methods of consolidating and developing their strengths to overcome their shortcomings.

Students should have strict and reasonable requirements, and their bad behaviors should be seriously and patiently explained to clarify the principles, improve their understanding, and make them distinguish right from wrong ideologically. If necessary, appropriate punishments can be supplemented. Correct punishment is also for the purpose of education. However, simple and crude practices should be prevented.

There are many ways to carry out ideological education for middle school students, but it is necessary to proceed from the requirements of socialist construction and the actual situation of middle school students, to study the characteristics of middle school students, understand their thoughts, feelings, interests, and hobbies, and carry out education based on these characteristics. Only in this way can good results be achieved.

At present, some schools often treat middle school students in the same way as adults. In extracurricular activities, they often rely on rigid, boring, and uninteresting "big reports, reading documents," and "criticism and self-criticism" methods to carry out ideological work; they over-manage and restrict students, do not distinguish between the different characteristics and levels of high school students and junior high school students, apply the requirements and practices for college students, and even mechanically apply some mass movement methods in society to treat young people. These practices are not in line with the actual situation of middle school students and are detrimental to the healthy growth of middle school students' physical and mental health.

Middle school students are young and lack knowledge, and the requirements and practices for college students cannot be mechanically transferred to middle schools without distinction. For example, regarding the issue of work and rest systems, colleges and universities should allow students more free time outside of class, while middle schools should provide more guidance to students on how to reasonably arrange their spare time, and school administration should make unified regulations on students' activities such as getting up, turning off the lights, and self-study. This is not excessive interference and restriction, but necessary guidance for middle school students. Of course, there should also be appropriate distinctions between high school students and junior high school students.

Middle school ideological education work mainly relies on teachers, and the Communist Youth League organization and Young Pioneers organization are close assistants to teachers. Teachers should always care about and guide the work of the League and Teams, and be good at obtaining the help of the League and Teams. League members should be required to be more advanced than ordinary students, but their age characteristics should also be taken into account, and the requirements for them must be appropriate. The significance of schools requiring League members to undertake social work lies first and foremost in cultivating their concept of serving the collective and training their ability to do work, rather than simply using them. At present, many schools inappropriately assign the work that should be undertaken by teachers to League members; regardless of the situation, League members are required to take the lead in everything, creating an excessive workload and mental pressure for League members. This phenomenon is abnormal and should be corrected.

    中学思想教育工作要照顾学生年龄特点	朱世和
    中学思想教育工作应该提高学生的政治觉悟，培养他们具有忠诚地为人民服务的优良品质。中学进行思想教育工作，应当根据学生现实的思想状况，照顾到学生的年龄特点，注意工作方法，才能收到更好的效果。
    中学思想教育工作的对象是青少年（一般年龄是从十二岁到十八岁）。他们既不同于儿童，也不同于成年人，他们有自成一个年龄阶段的特点。对于中学生思想教育工作应当注意这样两个问题：一个是中学生生活成长在现实的社会里，一方面受到党的培养教育，另一方面也受到家庭或社会上的资产阶级和小资产阶级思想意识的影响。因此，学校要对学生进行政治思想教育，必须和资产阶级及小资产阶级的思想作斗争，帮助青少年摆脱和抵制这些有害的思想影响。另一个问题是，青少年处在生理发育和心理发展变化最剧烈的时期，热心积极、精力充沛，渴求独立生活，他们想当成人，希望别人承认他们是成人，在他们的身上开始形成了一些成人的特点，但同时又带着明显的幼稚的特点。他们缺乏知识，缺乏生活的经验，缺乏自制力，在复杂的事物面前缺乏分辨是非的能力，思想方法容易片面、偏激。在这个时期，青少年十分需要合理的引导和教育。因此，教育工作对青少年有特殊重要的意义。在人类社会中，所以会产生教育工作和青年工作这两门事业，正是因为青少年需要指导，需要教育。
    青少年思想认识上和品行上的某些缺点、错误，就是由于受到剥削阶级和小生产者思想意识的影响，以及缺乏知识、缺乏经验而又得不到合理教育的结果。在通常的情况下，少年品行不好的原因往往出自年幼无知，受到剥削阶级意识的影响少一些；年龄大一些的青年，知识多一些，但受到剥削阶级意识的影响也容易多一些。这是就一般的情况来说的，各个学生自然有他各自不同的具体情况。教育工作者对待学生思想认识上的错误要采取具体分析的态度，找出产生错误的具体原因，然后加以合理地解决。现在，中学思想教育工作中，常常有些同志不具体分析青少年产生缺点的原因，笼统地认为那是剥削阶级思想意识的表现，因而他们采取的解决问题的方法，常常是一般化的甚至是粗暴的。
    在实际生活中，青少年产生缺点的原因是多方面的，错综复杂的。教育工作者对具体的人具体的问题，要作具体的分析，不能用简单的方法处理。对于中学生进行政治思想教育工作，在方法上应当掌握正面的、积极的引导的原则，多提倡通过主题会、课外阅读、公益劳动、同工厂和农村联系、课外研究小组等生动活泼、富有知识性和实践性的活动来进行。青少年精力旺盛，兴趣广泛，很愿意参加各种各样的课外活动。丰富多采的课外活动是帮助青少年接触社会生活，培养青少年新品德和扩大他们知识领域的一种因势利导的有效方法。这是为几年来许多成功的经验所一再证明了的。
    先进人物和先进事例对于中学生有着强烈的感染力量。刘胡兰、董存瑞、丁佑君、黄继光等英雄的事迹永远激动着青少年的良心。在英雄们的感召下，千百万个青年立志要学英雄的榜样，做无愧于祖国的好儿女。教育工作者要体察青少年的这种心情，有意识地在学生中树立榜样，经常向学生讲解革命先烈的斗争故事，指导学生阅读革命领袖和烈士的传记，看有关革命历史的戏剧、电影，举行革命节日的纪念会等。在日常生活中，也要经常表扬、奖励学生个人和学生集体在各个方面的良好表现，树立具体的好的榜样，鼓励学生奋发上进，形成良好的风气。教育工作者要善于发现学生的优点，用巩固和发展他们的优点的方法来克服他们的缺点。
    对于学生应该有严格的和合理的要求，对于他们的不良行为应该严肃地、耐心地说清道理，提高他们的认识，使他们从思想上分清是非，必要时可以辅以恰如其分的处分。正确的处分也是为着教育。但是，要防止简单的和粗暴的做法。
    对中学生进行思想教育的途径是多方面的，但是，必须要从社会主义建设的要求同中学生的实际出发，要研究中学生的特点，了解他们的思想感情、兴趣和爱好，并且根据这些特点来进行教育。只有这样，才能收到好的效果。
    目前，有些学校常常用对待成年人的办法来对待中学生。在课外活动当中，经常地依靠呆板乏味、引不起学生兴趣的“大报告、读文件”、“批评、检讨”的方法来进行思想工作；对学生管束、限制过多，不区分高中学生和初中学生不同的特点和水平，套用对大学生的要求和作法，甚至生硬地搬用社会上某些群众运动的方法对待青少年。这些作法，是不符合中学生的实际情况的，对于中学生身心的健全成长是不利的。
    中学生年龄小、知识少，不能把对大学生的要求和作法，不加区分地搬到中学里去。比如作息制度的问题，在大学里应当允许学生在课外有更多的自由支配的时间，在中学里就应当更多地指导学生合理安排课余时间，并且学校行政有必要对学生起床、熄灯、自修等活动作统一的规定。这并不是什么过多的干涉限制，而是对中学生必要的指导。当然，对于高中学生和初中学生，也应当有适当的分别。
    中学的思想教育工作主要依靠教师来做，青年团组织和少先队组织是教师的亲密助手。教师要经常关心和指导团、队的工作，善于取得团、队的帮助。对于团员应该要求他们比一般学生先进，但是同样要照顾到他们的年龄特点，对他们的要求一定要适当。学校要求团员担负社会工作的意义，首先也是在于培养他们为集体服务的观念和训练做工作的能力，而不是单纯的使用他们。目前，有许多学校不适当地把应当由教师担负的工作交给团员去完成；不分别情况，凡事要团员带头，造成团员过重的工作负担和精神上的压力，这种现象是不正常的，应当加以纠正。
