Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, February 17th: Prime Minister Nehru rejected on the 16th the proposal put forward by the US, UK and other four countries to the Security Council regarding the Kashmir issue, and accused these suggestions of being "completely wrong."

Regarding the suggestion in the proposal to send UN forces to Kashmir, Nehru said: "The suggestion to send UN forces to any place in the State of Jammu and Kashmir is a violation of international law and the UN Charter, unless India accepts it. We have stated that we will not, under any circumstances, accept any foreign troops stationed on our territory. However, the proposals of the United Kingdom and the United States also mention this point."

He said: "The question of a plebiscite was conditional when it was put forward, and the first condition was that Pakistan withdraw all its troops from Kashmir."

Earlier that day, during a campaign speech in Benares, Bihar Province, Nehru accused Britain of proposing this suggestion. He said: "In our view, the British government has chosen a path that is unjust to India, but we ourselves do not want to take this wrong path."

Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, February 17th: Pakistani Prime Minister Suhrawardy said here on the evening of the 16th that previous talks between Pakistan and India on Kashmir have repeatedly proven to be fruitless. He said that India has rejected nine suggestions, and we are not prepared to waste time on futile pursuits again.

Suhrawardy said: If India accepts the UN's order to hold a free and fair plebiscite after demilitarization, then the UN can decide on the method of the plebiscite that must be held under its auspices.

Suhrawardy asked his compatriots not to allow the Kashmir dispute to worsen relations between Pakistan and India. He pointed out that Pakistan and India are neighbors and have common interests.

He added that Pakistan is now strong enough to defend itself from aggression from anywhere, and that, according to the Baghdad Pact and the Southeast Asia Treaty, our allies are bound to come to our aid in the event that we are attacked.

    尼赫鲁反对派联合国部队到克什米尔
    苏拉瓦底表示不准备再同印度谈判
    新华社新德里17日电　尼赫鲁总理16日拒绝了美、英等四国向安全理事会提出的关于克什米尔问题的提案，并且指责这些建议是“完全错误的”。
    尼赫鲁谈到提案中关于派遣联合国部队到克什米尔的建议说：“派联合国部队到查谟和克什米尔邦任何地方的建议都是违反国际法和联合国宪章的，除非印度接受它。我们已经表明，我们在任何情况下都不会接受任何外国军队驻在我们的领土上。然而，联合王国和美国的提案也提到了这一点。”
    他说：“公民投票的问题在它提出来的时候就是有条件的，第一个条件是巴基斯坦把它的全部军队撤出克什米尔。”
    在这一天早些时候，尼赫鲁在比哈尔省贝拿勒斯的一次竞选演说中指责英国提出这个提案。他说：“在我们看来，英国政府选择了一条对印度不公正的道路，但是我们自己并不想走这条错误的道路。”
    据新华社卡拉奇17日电　巴基斯坦总理苏拉瓦底16日晚在这里说，巴基斯坦同印度以前举行的关于克什米尔的会谈已经屡次证明是没有成果的。他说，印度已经拒绝了九次建议，我们不准备再浪费时光徒作无益的追求。
    苏拉瓦底说：如果印度接受联合国的命令，在非军事化后举行自由和公平的公民投票，那么，联合国是能够决定必须在它主持下举行的公民投票的方法的。
    苏拉瓦底要求他的同胞们不要因为克什米尔纠纷而使巴基斯坦同印度的关系恶化。他指出：巴基斯坦同印度是邻居，它们有着共同的利益。
    他又说，巴基斯坦现在已经强大到足以防卫它自己不受任何地方来的侵略，而且，根据巴格达条约和东南亚条约的规定，在我们一旦受到侵略时，我们的盟国是一定要来援助我们的。
