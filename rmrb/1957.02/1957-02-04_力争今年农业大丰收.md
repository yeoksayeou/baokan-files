    As the season enters "Beginning of Spring" and the spring plowing season of 1957 is approaching, a large-scale production movement, mainly focused on spring plowing preparations, is forming a high tide in many regions. The in-depth development of this movement will lay a good foundation for a bumper agricultural harvest this year.
    This year's major production movement is being carried out on the basis of a comprehensive summary of last year's experiences and lessons. In many areas, this year's production plans are more practical and reliable, production arrangements are more comprehensive, and labor organization and labor planning are more rational. We hope that all parts of the country can be more planned, more orderly, and more down-to-earth in leading this year's major agricultural production.
    Organizing a nationwide large-scale production movement on the agricultural front to strive for a bumper harvest has better conditions this year than last year. In the past year, various localities lacked experience in leading large-scale cooperative agricultural production, and many regions encountered unprecedentedly severe natural disasters. However, even so, the national output of major crops increased last year, and grain output even exceeded that of the bumper year of 1955. This fact eloquently demonstrates the unparalleled superiority of agricultural cooperativization and the enormous potential for increased production it contains.
    The practice of the past year has trained the vast number of cadres and the masses in rural areas. A year ago, most people had no experience or habit of engaging in large-scale collective production labor, and certain chaotic phenomena in production were unavoidable. By accepting the experience and lessons of last year, agricultural production cooperatives in various places can reduce or avoid many mistakes and avoid wasting a lot of manpower and material resources when leading this year's major production, and better organize large-scale collective production.
    Some areas have excessively and one-sidedly emphasized some of the shortcomings and errors in last year's work, which may affect the enthusiasm and confidence of the masses in this year's major production. In order to organize this year's major production and strive for a bumper agricultural harvest, this abnormal mood must be resolutely reversed. According to the experience of Shanxi, Hubei and other provinces, the superiority of cooperativization must first be affirmed, and the achievements and progress made in all aspects in the past year must be affirmed. Shanxi Province made a vivid summary of the superiority of cooperativization and educated the broad masses of cadres and the masses, and as a result, people's mood has generally become active. There, preparations for spring plowing, construction of farmland water conservancy, and sideline production have all made progress. This is a clear example.
    For some agricultural cooperatives that suffered from natural disasters last year, they should also be encouraged to step up their efforts this year and strive for increased production. For a small number of farmers whose lives have become difficult due to reduced production, they should also be helped to solve some of the difficulties that can be solved in their lives. Only in this way can all cadres and the masses be mobilized to invest in this year's major production movement with full enthusiasm and confidence.
    According to the experience of 1956, correctly and comprehensively arranging production and formulating practical production plans are important links in smoothly carrying out the annual major production. Agricultural cooperatives in various places should pay attention when formulating plans that the targets should not be too high, should not be divorced from reality, should not only focus on agriculture and lose sideline production, and should not ignore the possible care for the individual production and life of the members. It is necessary to comprehensively arrange production and develop diversified economies. It is necessary to grasp agriculture, but also appropriately arrange sideline production; it is necessary to grasp the production of major crops such as grain and cotton, but also appropriately arrange the proportion of cash crops; it is necessary to grasp collective production, but also appropriately give members room for free activities. All production targets and plans must be fully reliable so that they can play a positive role in guiding and promoting production. Overly high production plans are certainly not good; however, if the plans are too low, they will not be able to inspire the confidence of the masses and promote the development of production, and this disadvantage is also not small. The tendency to only care about the immediate interests of the members, focusing on sideline production while relaxing agriculture, and only valuing cash crops while ignoring food crops should still be vigorously prevented.
    Vigorously carrying out agricultural capital construction on the basis of cooperativization and promoting the necessary reforms in the cultivation system and cultivation technology are the decisive factors for increasing agricultural production. Some rural workers still lack an active spirit for technical reform. For example, some places have reduced production due to improper promotion of double-cropping rice, so they believe that "single-to-double" is all wrong, and this year they will implement "double-to-single" across the board. Some places reduced production last year due to improper close planting, so they believe that close planting is completely wrong, and this year they plan to implement "dense-to-sparse" across the board. In addition, some places drilled some abandoned wells last year, and this year they dare not even engage in the necessary farmland water conservancy construction. These comrades have not patiently analyzed the reasons for the reduced production, but are only passively afraid of reform, and this sentiment is extremely harmful. We must actively and steadily continue to promote the reform of cultivation technology and cultivation system that are suitable for local conditions. The experience in this area over the past year has been quite rich. However, this work is very complicated, and in the specific implementation process, it is necessary to carry out many detailed and complex ideological and organizational work. One of the outstanding lessons of the failure of technical reforms in some areas last year was the failure to consult with the masses. In the future, in technical reforms, we must consult with the masses more and try to avoid or reduce subjectivist errors. This is an extremely important issue for striving for a bumper agricultural harvest in 1957.
    At present, the major agricultural production movement is not being carried out vigorously and universally enough in some areas. In addition to the general reasons mentioned above, there are several specific reasons in different regions. Such as the autumn harvest distribution has not been finalized, the members do not know the bottom line, the production and rectification of the society have not been well combined, agriculture and sideline production have not been uniformly arranged, some members are enthusiastic about commerce and ignore agriculture, and other improper arrangements for central work, and so on. These are all obstacles to major production and need to be specifically resolved. Party and government leading organs in various places should take effective measures and use the greatest strength and determination to organize a major production upsurge that is wider and more enthusiastic than last year, and strive to achieve greater victories on the agricultural front in the final year of my country's first five-year plan.

### 力争今年农业大丰收

    力争今年农业大丰收
    在时令进入“立春”，1957年的春耕季节快要到来的时候，一个规模宏大的以春耕准备为主要内容的生产运动正在许多地区形成高潮。这个运动的深入发展，将给今年农业大丰收打下良好的基础。
    今年的大生产运动是在全面总结了去年经验教训的基础上开展起来的。许多地区今年的生产计划订得更加切实可靠了，生产安排更加全面了，劳动组织和劳动规划也更加合理了。我们希望全国各地在今年农业大生产的领导上都能够更有计划、更有秩序和更加踏实。
    在农业战线上组织一个全国规模的大生产运动，争取大丰收，今年比去年具有更好的条件。过去的一年，各地对于大规模合作化的农业生产的领导还缺乏经验，而许多地区又遇到了空前严重的自然灾害，但是，即便是这样，去年全国主要农作物都增产了，粮食产量甚至超过了丰收的1955年。这个事实雄辩地说明了农业合作化的无比优越性，说明了农业合作化蕴藏着多么巨大的增产可能性。
    一年来的实践，锻炼了农村中广大的干部和群众。一年以前，大多数人都还没有进行大规模集体生产劳动的经验和习惯，生产中的某些混乱现象曾经是不可避免的。接受去年的经验教训，在领导今年大生产的时候，各地的农业生产合作社就有可能减少或避免发生许多错误，就有可能减少或避免浪费许多人力物力，把大规模的集体生产组织得更好一些。
    有些地区曾经过分地片面地强调了去年工作中的一些缺点和错误，这可能会影响到群众对今年大生产的热情和信心。为了组织今年大生产，争取农业大丰收，这种不正常的情绪必须坚决地把它扭转过来。根据山西、湖北等省的经验，首先要肯定合作化的优越性，肯定过去一年中各方面所获得的成绩和进步。山西省把合作化的优越性作了生动的总结，并对广大干部和群众进行教育的结果，人们的情绪普遍活跃起来。在那里，目前春耕准备工作、兴修农田水利和副业生产都获得了进展。这就是一个明显的例子。
    对于去年遭受自然灾害的一部分农业合作社，也要鼓舞他们在今年加紧努力，争取增产。对于一小部分因减产而生活上发生困难的农户，还应当帮助他们解决一些生活上可能解决的困难。这样才能使所有的干部和群众都积极起来，以饱满的热情和信心投入今年的大生产运动。
    根据1956年的经验，正确地全面地安排生产，制定切合实际的生产计划，是顺利开展全年大生产的重要环节。各地的农业合作社都要注意在制定计划的时候，指标不可过高，不可脱离实际，不可只抓农业而丢掉副业，不可忽视对社员个人生产和生活的可能的照顾。必须全面安排生产，发展多种经济。既要抓紧农业，也要适当安排副业；既要抓紧粮棉等主要作物的生产，也要适当安排经济作物的比例；既要抓紧集体生产，也要适当给社员个人以自由活动的余地。一切生产指标和计划都必须充分可靠，使它能够发挥指导和推动生产的积极作用。过高的生产计划固然不好；但是，计划偏低就不能鼓舞群众的信心和推动生产的发展，这个坏处也不小。对于那种只顾社员眼前利益、偏重副业而放松农业，只重视经济作物而忽视粮食作物等偏向，仍然应该极力防止。
    在合作化基础上大力进行农业基本建设，推行耕作制度和耕作技术的必要改革，是农业增产的决定性因素。有些农村工作人员对于技术改革还缺乏积极的精神。比如，有些地方由于推广双季稻不得其法而减产，便认为“单改双”统统错了，今年便要一概实行“双改单”。有些地方去年因密植不当而减产，便认为密植完全错了，今年打算一概实行“密改稀”。另外有些地方去年打了一些废井，今年就连必要的农田水利建设也不敢搞了。这些同志没有耐心地分析减产的原因，只是消极地害怕改革，这种情绪是极端有害的。我们必须积极地稳步地继续推行切合当地条件的耕作技术和耕作制度的改革。一年来在这一方面的经验是相当丰富的。但是，这一工作是十分复杂的，在具体推行的过程中，还要进行许多细致复杂的思想工作和组织工作。去年有些地区技术改革失败的突出教训之一，就是不跟群众商量。今后在技术改革中必须多找群众商量，尽量避免或减少主观主义的错误。这是争取1957年农业大丰收的一个极为重要的问题。
    目前农业大生产运动在有一些地区还进行得不够有力和普遍。除了前面所说的一般原因以外，各个不同地区还有若干具体的原因。如秋收分配没有决算，社员不摸底，生产和整社没有结合好，农业和副业没有统一安排好，有些社员热心商业、忽视农业，以及其他中心工作安排不当等等。这些都是大生产的障碍，需要具体地加以解决。各地党政领导机关应当采取有效措施，以最大的力量和决心来组织一个比去年更广泛更热烈的大生产高潮，争取在我国第一个五年计划的最后一年，在农业战线上取得更大的胜利。
