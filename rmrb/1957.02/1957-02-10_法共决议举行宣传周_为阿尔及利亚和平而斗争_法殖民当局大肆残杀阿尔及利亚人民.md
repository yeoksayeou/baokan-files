Xinhua News Agency, February 9th, dispatch from TASS, Paris, February 8th: The Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party has passed a resolution to hold a "Propaganda Week for the Struggle for Peace in Algeria" from February 25th to March 3rd.

The resolution pointed out: The policies implemented by the Mollet government in Algeria over the past year have undermined the possibility of reaching an agreement between France and Algeria. The masses of people are suffering the fatal consequences of this policy every day, such as deteriorating living conditions, because the Algerian war consumes 1.4 billion francs every day.

The resolution said: The government's policy, based on refusing to meet the national demands of the Algerian people, is bound to cause the continuation and intensification of the war, deepening France's international isolation.

The Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party pointed out in the resolution: The Algerian question must be resolved through negotiations, on the basis of recognizing the Algerian people's right to independence. "This just solution, which is in line with the current situation in Algeria, is the only solution that is in line with the national interests of France, because this solution can create conditions for establishing close new political, economic and cultural relations between France and Algeria, which is liberated from the colonial system - relations based on friendship, equality and free consultation."

The Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party called on communist organizations at all levels to actively launch a movement to stop the Algerian war.

Xinhua News Agency, February 7th, dispatch from Algiers: Following the eight-day general strike throughout Algeria, the Algerian National Liberation Army has launched extensive attacks on the French colonialists.

On the 6th, insurgents blew up railways and attacked French trains five times on the Algiers-Oran, Algiers-Constantine, and Banna-Biskra railway lines. A portion of the French army stationed in Tunisia near the Algerian border was also attacked by the Algerian National Liberation Army on the night of the 6th. The frequently used highway from Oran to Mostaganem in western Algeria was also cut off by the National Liberation Army for a time.

Although the eight-day general strike called by the Algerian National Liberation Front ended on the 4th, most shops in Algiers continued to be closed on the 5th to show solidarity with those shops that were unreasonably closed by the colonial authorities.

In recent days, the French colonial authorities have dispatched military police to search, arrest and massacre the insurgent people of Algeria.

    法殖民当局大肆残杀阿尔及利亚人民
    新华社9日讯　据塔斯社巴黎8日讯：法国共产党中央政治局通过决议，从2月25日到3月3日举行“为阿尔及利亚和平而斗争的宣传周”。
    决议指出：摩勒政府一年来在阿尔及利亚所实行的政策，破坏了在法国和阿尔及利亚之间达成协议的可能性。人民大众每天都遭受到这种政策的致命后果，例如生活条件变坏等，因为阿尔及利亚战争每天要消耗十四亿法郎。
    决议说：以拒绝满足阿尔及利亚人民的民族要求为基础的政府政策，必然要造成战争的继续和加剧，加深法国在国际上的孤立。
    法共中央政治局在决议中指出：必须用谈判的方法、在承认阿尔及利亚人民独立权利的基础上解决阿尔及利亚问题。“这种符合阿尔及利亚目前局势的公正解决方法是符合法国民族利益的唯一解决方法，因为这样解决可以为在法国和从殖民制度下获得解放的阿尔及利亚之间在政治、经济和文化方面建立紧密的新关系——基于友爱、平等和自由协商的关系创造条件”。
    法共中央政治局号召共产党各级组织积极展开争取停止阿尔及利亚战争的运动。
    新华社7日讯　阿尔及尔消息：紧接着阿尔及利亚全境八天的总罢工之后，阿尔及利亚民族解放军又广泛展开了对法国殖民者的袭击行动。
    起义者6日在阿尔及尔—阿兰、阿尔及尔—康斯坦丁、巴那—比斯克拉等铁路线上五次爆炸铁路和袭击法方火车。驻在突尼斯境内邻近阿尔及利亚边境的一部分法军6日也遭到阿尔及利亚民族解放军的夜袭。从阿兰通往阿尔及利亚西部莫斯塔加内的交通频繁的公路也一度被民族解放军切断。
    在阿尔及利亚民族解放战线号召下举行的八天总罢工虽然已经在4日结束，但是阿尔及尔市内绝大多数商店5日仍继续关门，以声援那些被殖民当局无理封闭的商店。
    法国殖民当局连日派出军警在各地大肆搜捕和残杀阿尔及利亚的起义人民。
