Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, February 26th - According to TASS, Berlin, February 26th: The Director of the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the German Democratic Republic (GDR), Mr. Heymann, issued a statement at a press conference on February 26 regarding the hostile activities of the United States against the GDR and several other countries. He emphasized that the GDR government possesses a large amount of evidence proving that the United States is engaged in activities hostile to the GDR and other People's Democracies.

Heymann said that on December 21, 1956, the GDR submitted a memorandum to UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld regarding the interference of the United States of America in the internal affairs of the German Democratic Republic, and intended to send representatives to New York to explain the contents of the memorandum to the UN Political Committee. However, the US State Department refused to issue entry visas.

The full text of the GDR government's memorandum has been distributed to participants in the press conference. This memorandum, along with the attached documents and photographs, shows how the United States is using a large number of spy organizations in West Germany and West Berlin, as well as the American "RIAS" radio station, to carry out subversive activities against the GDR, Poland, Czechoslovakia and other countries.

At the press conference, Mr. Beylin, the leader of the Premier's Press Office, emphasized that the GDR demands that the United States cease its subversive activities and refrain from interfering in the internal affairs of the GDR and other People's Democracies.
