Xinhua News Agency, 6th Dispatch:

    Based on the significant achievements made last year, China's machine industry will continue to trial-produce a batch of new products with larger capacity and higher precision this year. The First Ministry of Machine Building and the Ministry of Electrical Machinery Industry alone have initially planned to trial-produce more than 600 new types of products this year.

    In terms of power and動力 equipment, this year will see the start of trial production of 72,500 kW hydraulic turbine generator sets. The huge, newly built Xin'anjiang Hydropower Station will be fully equipped with this domestically produced equipment. In addition, there will be a complete set of 25,000 kW thermal power equipment, the boiler for which is a high-pressure boiler with a steam evaporation capacity of 120 tons per hour. There is also a 675 horsepower land-based diesel engine, which is much more powerful than the largest diesel engine that has been successfully trial-produced in the past.

    This year, the machine industry will trial-produce oxygen production equipment capable of producing 3,350 cubic meters of oxygen per minute for metallurgical enterprises, to provide the material conditions for oxygen steelmaking. It will also trial-produce blowers for the metallurgical industry and the chemical industry capable of delivering 1,100 cubic meters of producer gas per minute and 700 cubic meters of sulfide gas per minute. Other new products planned for trial production this year include large vertical water pumps with a capacity of 4,300 cubic meters of water per hour, giant transformers of 40,500 kVA, and 80-ton electric locomotives, multi-channel carrier long-distance communication cables, etc.

    Several rolling mills have also been included in the machine industry's list of new products to be trial-produced. These rolling mills have never been manufactured in China before. Among them, there is one that can roll silicon steel sheets 1.2 meters wide, and another that can roll various alloy steel ingots, including advanced alloy steel ingots. Among the metallurgical equipment and mining excavation equipment planned for trial production this year are large crushers that can crush 350 tons of ore per hour, bridge casting cranes with a lifting capacity of 140 tons, and large coal mine shaft winches with a drum diameter of 5 meters.

    Among the machine tools and forging equipment that China's machine industry plans to trial-produce this year are more than a dozen special machine tools and more than a dozen automatic and semi-automatic machine tools. Among them, there is a high-precision single-axis automatic lathe that can not only automatically process parts, but also produce parts that can achieve first-class precision; there is also a four-axis automatic lathe that can process four parts simultaneously, which is very efficient. In terms of forging equipment, it is planned to trial-produce a 2,600-ton hydraulic press, which is an indispensable piece of equipment for manufacturing large machine parts such as generator shafts and rolling mill rolls.

    In 1957, China's machine industry will also trial-produce new types of dining cars, insulated cars, oil tankers with a carrying capacity of 4,500 tons, coastal freighters with a carrying capacity of 5,000 tons, and more than a dozen other important equipment for the transportation industry; and will trial-produce many types of agricultural machinery, including tractors, for agriculture. In addition, many light industrial equipment, including a complete set of sugar manufacturing equipment with a daily sugarcane crushing capacity of 3,000 tons, as well as machinery and equipment needed by the chemical industry, petroleum industry, geological exploration and other departments will also be trial-produced this year.

    在已有成就的基础上继续提高技术水平
    机器工业今年将试制大批新产品
    新华社6日讯　中国机器工业今年将在去年取得重大成就的基础上，继续试制一批容量更大、精度更高的新产品。只是第一机械工业部和电机制造工业部今年初步计划试制的重要新种类产品，就有六百多种。
    在电力和动力设备方面，今年将开始试制七万二千五百瓩的水轮发电机组，巨大的新建新安江水电站，将全部安装这种国产的设备。此外，还有两万五千瓩的全套火力发电设备，这套设备用的锅炉是每小时蒸发量一百二十吨的高压锅炉。还有一种六百七十五马力的陆用柴油机，它比过去试制成功的最大柴油机的马力要大得多。
    机器工业今年将为冶金企业试制每分钟制氧三千三百五十立方公尺的制氧设备，以提供加氧炼钢的物质条件；将为冶金工业、化学工业试制每分钟输送一千一百立方公尺发生炉气体和每分钟输送七百立方公尺硫化物气体的鼓风机。另外今年计划试制的新产品中，还有每小时输水四千三百立方公尺的大型立式水泵、四万零五百千伏安的巨型变压器，以及八十吨电机车、多路载波的长途通讯电缆等。
    还有几种轧钢机也已经列进了机器工业试制新产品的名单。这些轧钢机在中国还从来没有制造过。其中，有一种可以轧制一公尺二宽的矽钢片；还有一种可以轧制包括高级合金钢锭在内的各种合金钢锭。今年计划试制的冶金设备和矿山采掘设备中，有每小时可以破碎三百五十吨矿石的大型破碎机，起重能力一百四十吨的桥式铸造吊车，滚筒直径五公尺的大型煤矿矿井卷扬机等产品。
    中国机器工业今年计划试制的工作母机和锻压设备中，有十几种专用机床和十几种自动和半自动机床。其中有一种高精度的单轴自动车床，不但可以自动地加工零件，而且加工出的零件可以达到一级精度；还有一种四轴自动车床，能够同时加工四个零件，效率很高。锻压设备方面，计划试制一种压力两千六百吨的水压机，它是制造发电机轴、轧钢机轧辊等大型机件不可缺少的设备。
    1957年，中国机器工业还将为交通运输业试制新型餐车、保温车、载油量四千五百吨油轮、载货量五千吨沿海货轮等十几种重要的设备；将为农业试制包括拖拉机在内的许多种农业机器。此外，包括日榨甘蔗三千吨全套制糖设备在内的许多轻工业设备，以及化学工业、石油工业、地质勘探等部门所需要的机器设备也将在今年试制。
