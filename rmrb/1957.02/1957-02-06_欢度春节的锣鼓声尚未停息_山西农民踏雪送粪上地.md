Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 5th: On February 4th, the day of the Beginning of Spring, the sounds of drums celebrating the Spring Festival in various parts of Shanxi had not yet ceased, but farmers were already beginning their preparations for spring plowing. From the loess plateau area of ​​Yanbei to the Taihang Mountains running through the southeast of the province, there were teams of people stepping through the accumulated snow to deliver manure. In the depths of the Taihang Mountains, the four agricultural cooperatives of Sitou Township, Pingshun County, on this day of the Beginning of Spring, more than 250 male and female members cleared more than a foot of snow after a heavy snowfall, while transporting manure, accumulating fertilizer, and repairing field embankments. On this day, they transported more than 1,400 loads of manure, even more efficient than usual. The Xigou Township Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative, led by Li Shunda, held a commencement ceremony for all members on the morning of the Beginning of Spring. Teams and groups launched a red flag competition to strive for a yield of 450 jin of grain per mu and to ensure the early completion of the plan to increase fertilizer and renovate land. After the meeting, the members immediately went up the mountain to sweep away snow and pave roads, and began transporting manure.

In Jinzhong area, where there has always been a custom of "no moving earth before the fifth day of the new year," farmers this year also exceptionally began delivering manure and transporting coal on the second and third days of the new year. On the day of the Beginning of Spring, members of more than 330 agricultural cooperatives in the suburbs of Taiyuan City had just seen off visiting workers and officers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and they put away their musical instruments, took off their festive clothes, and immediately threw themselves into preparations for spring plowing. The Rural Work Department of the Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China received reports from various districts on this day indicating that no less than 60% of the members of each cooperative in the entire suburbs were engaged in production, with the highest reaching more than 80%.

On the day of the Beginning of Spring, leading cadres in various places also took action and went deep into the rural cooperatives to lead the preparations for spring plowing. On this day, Pingshun County held spring plowing mobilization meetings for township and cooperative cadres in eight areas, criticizing the lax ideas of some cadres and members, such as "resting for the whole first month of the new year."

    欢度春节的锣鼓声尚未停息
    山西农民踏雪送粪上地
    据新华社太原5日电　4日立春这天，山西各地欢度春节的锣鼓声尚未停息，农民们就展开了备耕活动。从雁北黄土高原地区，到贯穿全省东南部的太行山区，到处有一队队的踏着积雪来往送粪的人群。远处太行山深处平顺县寺头乡的四个农业社，在立春这天有二百五十多个男女社员在大雪后一面清扫一尺多厚的积雪，一面运粪、积肥和修整地堰，这天他们一共运了一千四百多担粪，比平时劳动效率还高。李顺达领导的西沟乡农林牧生产合作社，在立春这天的上午，举行了全体社员开工典礼大会，队与队和组与组之间，为争取每亩产粮四百五十斤，保证提前完成增肥和整修土地的计划，展开了红旗竞赛。会后，社员们立即上山扫雪、垫路，开始运送粪肥。
    历来有“不破五不动土”的习惯的晋中地区，今年农民们也破例在初二、初三开始送粪、运煤。太原市郊区三百三十多个农业社的社员，在立春这天刚刚送走来访的工人和中国人民解放军军官，就收起乐器、脱掉节日服装，立即投入备耕活动。中共太原市委农村工作部在这天接到各区的汇报表明：全郊区各社投入生产的社员不下60％，最多的达到80％以上。
    立春这天，各地的领导机关干部也行动起来，深入乡社领导备耕工作。平顺县在这一天分八片召开乡、社干部春耕动员大会，批判某些干部和社员“歇正月”等松懈思想。
