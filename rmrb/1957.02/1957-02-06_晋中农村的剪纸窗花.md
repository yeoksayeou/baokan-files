    Jinglei Rural Paper-cut Window Flowers
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Guo Jie
    At the Spring Festival, families in Jinglei's rural areas traditionally paste unique paper-cut window flowers on their windows. This year, this Spring Festival decoration is even more widespread.
    Yang Anzhen, an old woman who is a member of the Zhenli Agricultural Cooperative in Chengguan, Qixian County, has skillful paper-cutting techniques. Before the Spring Festival, she worked day and night to produce a batch of new works. Among them are "Planting Trees," "Sending Grain to the Granary," and "People Love Tractors." The newly completed window flower "Eliminate the Four Pests" depicts a child hiding next to a tree, waiting for sparrows to fly into the bamboo basket he is holding up. In the picture, some sparrows are frightened and flying away, while others are flying down. Although only simple cuts are used, it is very lifelike. Another window flower, "Every Family Raises Pigs," is also a work that expresses the current reality. In the picture, five fat pigs are in different postures. Some have already squeezed to the trough, while others are waiting for the feeder to serve food. The piglets cannot reach the food and are trying to squeeze in. Yang Anzhen is seventy-one years old this year. Before liberation, most of her works were copied, and they were mostly based on stories from operas, as well as flowers, birds, landscapes, and historical figures. After liberation, she often drew on real-life stories as sketching material, giving this national-style paper-cutting art a new life.

### 晋中农村的剪纸窗花

    晋中农村的剪纸窗花	新华社记者　郭洁
    一到春节，晋中农村各家窗纸上总要按传统习惯贴起新颖别致的剪纸窗花。今年，这种春节特有的装饰更加普遍了。
    祁县城关真理农业社的社员杨庵贞老太太，剪窗花的手艺很巧妙。她春节前连夜赶剪了一批新作品。其中有“植树”、“送粮入库”和“人们喜爱拖拉机”等，刚完成的“除四害”的窗花，画着一个儿童藏在树旁，正等着麻雀飞进他撑起的竹筐子里，图中麻雀有的正受惊飞去，有的却向下飞来，虽然只用几剪简单的裁作，但是十分逼真。另一件“家家养猪”的窗花，也是一件表达当前现实生活的作品。图中五只肥猪姿态各异，有的已经挤到槽边，有的却正等着饲养人盛食物，小猪因为吃不到，正在往里钻。杨庵贞老太太今年已经七十一岁，解放以前，她的大部分作品是临摹来的，而且多是取材于戏曲中的故事以及花鸟、风景、历史人物等。解放后，她经常吸取现实生活故事作为写生的素材，使这种富有民族风格的剪纸艺术获得了新的生命力。
