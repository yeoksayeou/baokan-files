Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 15th. News: The Japanese Supreme Public Prosecutor's Office has determined that the American soldier, Jerard, suspected of shooting and killing Japanese farmer Sakai, committed the crime of "injury resulting in death outside the line of duty."

According to the instructions of the Supreme Public Prosecutor's Office, the responsible official of the Maebashi District Public Prosecutor's Office in Gunma Prefecture this afternoon handed a document to Colonel Jordan, the commander of the US military's Waddington Camp to which Jerard belongs. The document stated that the Japanese side would prosecute Jerard for "injury resulting in death."

Kamedadeji, chairman of the Cabinet Committee of the House of Councillors, and seven others, after investigating the Sakai shooting incident on the spot yesterday, issued a statement in Maebashi saying that the incident occurred outside the line of duty and that the Japanese side has the right to adjudicate. They have requested the US military camp authorities to pay all compensation fees.

The victim's family has requested compensation of 800,000 yen.

The Director of the Criminal Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Justice, Imoto, replied to a question in the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee today, saying that regarding the issue of jurisdiction in the Sakai shooting case, the Japanese side has reached the conclusion that the shooting incident did not occur while on duty, but the US side claims that it was an incident that occurred while on duty. Therefore, it has been decided to submit this issue to the Criminal Special Committee of the Japan-US Joint Committee for resolution.

According to the unequal Japan-US Administrative Agreement, the Japanese side does not have jurisdiction when US military personnel stationed in Japan commit crimes while on duty.

    美国兵杀害日本农妇案
    日本检察当局决定提出起诉
    新华社15日讯　东京消息：日本最高检察厅已经确定枪杀日本农妇坂井的嫌疑犯美国兵哲腊德犯了“在非执行公务时间内伤人致死罪”。
    根据最高检察厅的指示，群马县前桥地方检察厅负责官员今天下午已经将一份公文交给哲腊德所属的美军威丁顿军营的司令约旦上校，这项公文声明日本方面要以“伤人致死罪”对哲腊德起诉。
    参议院内阁委员会委员长龟田得治等七人昨天到现场调查枪杀坂井事件后，在前桥发表谈话说，这个事件是在执行公务以外的时候发生的，日本方面有裁判权。他们已经要求美国军营当局全部发给赔偿费。
    被害者的家属已经要求赔偿八十万日元。
    法务省刑事局长井本今天在众议院法务委员会上答复质询时说，关于枪杀坂井事件的裁判权问题，日本方面已经做出结论，认为枪杀事件并不是在执行公务时发生的，但是美国方面却主张这是在执行公务中发生的事件。因此这个问题已经决定提交日美联合委员会刑事特别委员会去解决。
    按照不平等的日美行政协定的规定，驻日美军人员在执行公务期间犯罪时，日本方面没有裁判权。
