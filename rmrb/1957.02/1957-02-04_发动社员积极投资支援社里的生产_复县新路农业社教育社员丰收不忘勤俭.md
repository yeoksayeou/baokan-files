    Mobilize Commune Members to Actively Invest in and Support the Production of the Commune
    Xinlu Agricultural Commune in Fuxian County Educates Commune Members Not to Forget Thrift in Times of Bumper Harvest
    Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 3rd – Under the education of "Bumper Harvests Don't Forget Thrift," more than half of the commune members of the Xinlu Agricultural Commune in Laopipu Township, Fuxian County, Liaoning Province, have made normal arrangements for their family lives. From January 15th to 20th, in just five days, commune members deposited more than 32,100 yuan of surplus money into the credit cooperative and invested it in the agricultural commune. As a result, the agricultural commune added more than 3,000 jin of fruit tree insecticide, which promoted the preparatory work for spring plowing and production in the entire commune.
    Last year, 90.7% of the commune members of the Xinlu Agricultural Commune saw an increase in income. The entire commune of more than 8,000 people had an average income of 80 yuan per person, an increase of 60.9% compared to 1955. At the beginning of January this year, the Xinlu Agricultural Commune settled its accounts and conducted the final distribution of the year. The commune members had more money in hand, so some commune members bought things that were not needed immediately or were superfluous. For example, commune members Chen Defeng and two others each originally had a set of cotton clothes, but after the distribution, each bought three more, saying: "We can take turns wearing them and wear new ones every day." Commune member Wan Fusheng, who was in charge of herding sheep, bought a Baishan brand bicycle for more than 120 yuan, even though he didn't need one, and hung it on the roof. Some commune members also went to the city to spend money without a purpose.
    After discovering this situation, the Communist Party branch of the Xinlu Commune promptly held a special branch meeting on January 13th for focused study. After the meeting, it organized the branch secretaries of the five work areas in the entire commune and some members of the cooperative management committee to go to each work area to hold commune member meetings to carry out the education of "Bumper Harvests Don't Forget Thrift." Then, adopting individual connections, they also went to the homes of commune members to help them make long-term plans and normal arrangements for their family lives. In this way, most commune members were able to purchase supplies in a planned manner based on actual needs. Female commune member Qu Liurong, who originally planned to buy a watch, used the money she had planned to buy a watch to buy two piglets to raise after arranging her family life. Wan Fusheng, who bought a Baishan brand bicycle, also resold the bicycle to someone who needed it at the original price. Most commune members, due to the normal arrangement of their family lives, deposited the remaining money in the credit cooperative or invested it in the agricultural commune. The number of people participating in the commune's preparation for spring plowing and production, such as collecting manure and selecting seeds, has also increased.

    发动社员积极投资支援社里的生产
    复县新路农业社教育社员丰收不忘勤俭
    新华社沈阳3日电　在“丰收不忘勤俭”的教育下，辽宁省复县老皮铺乡新路农业社有半数以上的社员对家庭生活作了正常安排。从1月15日到20日，仅五天光景，社员们存入信用合作社和向农业社投资的余钱就有三万二千一百多元。农业社从而添置了三千多斤杀果虫药剂，推动了全社春耕生产的准备工作。
    新路农业社去年有90.7％的社员收入增加，全社八千多口人，平均每人收入八十元，比1955年的收入增加60.9％。今年1月初，新路农业社结清了帐目，进行了全年最后一次分配。社员们的手头宽裕了，因而部分社员买了些眼前不需用的或多余的东西。如社员陈德凤等三人本来各有一套棉衣，分配后每人又买了三件，他们说：轮换着穿，天天穿新的。担负放羊职务的社员万福生，本来不需要自行车，也花了一百二十多元买了一辆白山牌自行车，吊在屋顶上放着。还有的社员没有目的地进城花钱。
    新路社共产党支部发现这个情况后，在1月13日及时召开支部会议进行专门研究，会后组织全社五个作业区的分支部书记和合作社管理委员会部分委员，分别到各作业区，召开社员会议，进行“丰收不忘勤俭”的教育，接着，采取个别串连办法，又分别到社员家中帮助做出长远打算计划和正常地安排家庭生活。这样，大部分社员都能根据实际需要有计划地购买用品了。原来计划买手表的女社员曲六容，经过家庭生活安排，拿原来计划买手表的钱买了两口仔猪饲养。买了白山牌自行车的万福生，也按原价把车子转卖给需要的人了。大部分社员由于正常地安排家庭生活，把余下的钱都存到信用社里或向农业社投资。参加社内起粪、选种等春耕生产准备的人数也多起来了。
