Several Issues in the Work of Cultivating Ethnic Minority Cadres
                    Ye Shangzhi
    In the past few years, our country's work in cultivating ethnic minority cadres has achieved great success, but there are still many problems. The main problems are: the quantity and quality of ethnic minority cadres cannot keep up with the needs of work development, especially the lack of leading backbone and professional technical personnel is still severe, the phenomenon of some ethnic minority cadres having positions without power is still very serious, and the work of nationalizing the organs in ethnic minority autonomous areas needs to be further strengthened.

      Increasing the Number of Ethnic Minority Cadres
    The political, economic, and cultural undertakings in ethnic minority areas, along with the development of the national socialist revolution and construction, are also accelerating. Because of this, all ethnic minority areas are increasingly feeling the shortage of cadres. This situation is more obvious in areas undergoing large-scale industrial construction (such as the Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang autonomous regions) and other areas where work is progressing faster. According to statistics at the end of 1955, Han cadres accounted for about 0.93% of the Han population nationwide, while ethnic minority cadres accounted for an average of only 0.59% of the ethnic minority population nationwide. In various ethnic minority areas, except for the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, where the proportion of ethnic minority cadres to the local ethnic minority population reached 1.7%, and Jilin Province, where it reached 1.3%, other areas are lower than the proportion of Han cadres. In some areas, ethnic minority cadres only account for 0.2% of the ethnic minority population. The reasons for this situation are mainly due to the relatively short history of work development and the limitations of social conditions in some areas; however, some ethnic minority areas are also due to insufficient subjective effort. Obviously, the social conditions in some ethnic minority areas are not behind other ethnic minority areas, or even some Han areas. In such areas, it is possible to cultivate more ethnic minority cadres. Therefore, continuing to increase the number of ethnic minority cadres in the future is still an important task in many ethnic minority areas.

    Increasing the number of ethnic minority cadres mainly comes from two sources: on the one hand, absorbing cadres from ethnic minority students and graduates of universities, various professional and technical schools, and other schools; on the other hand, paying full attention to absorbing active members of the ethnic minority working masses who have emerged from mass movements and various construction undertakings. In addition, attention should also be paid to absorbing cadres from out-of-school ethnic minority youth, old intellectuals and old military and political personnel scattered in society who are able to work; in ethnic minority areas with private industry and commerce, capitalists and their agents, and small business owners after public-private partnerships can also be absorbed to participate in work. Appropriate arrangements should also be made for upper-class figures and religious figures of ethnic minorities. When absorbing ethnic minority cadres, concrete plans should be made according to the needs of work development, following the principle of self-reliance and utilizing local resources, and carried out step by step. We must prevent the tendency of being overanxious for quick results and filling positions with unqualified people, and also prevent the tendency of setting inappropriately high requirements, which may lead to closed-doorism and conservatism. In the work of streamlining institutions and reducing staffing, we should pay attention to preventing the phenomenon of arbitrarily reducing ethnic minority cadres, and pay attention to giving necessary consideration according to the special needs of ethnic minority areas (such as the need for translation, arranging various upper-class figures, and equipping relevant ethnic cadres).

        Improving the Quality of Cadres
    Improving the quality of ethnic minority cadres is another important task in the current work of cultivating ethnic minority cadres. The current problem is that on the existing basis, ethnic minority cadres must be given further systematic political training, and on this basis, relatively senior ethnic minority cadres should undergo systematic study of Marxism-Leninism theory, and attention should be paid to cultivating ethnic minority theoretical work cadres. Only by doing this work well can ethnic minority communist cadres grow up better, and without such cadres, it is impossible to solve the ethnic minority problem. At the same time, due to the increasing development of various tasks and the gradual refinement of the division of labor, we must systematically help ethnic minority cadres improve their cultural level and enrich their professional knowledge, so that they can do their work happily and competently. In addition, we must attach importance to cultivating ethnic minority scientific and technical personnel. Although this is a long-term task, we must strengthen this work in a planned way from now on to meet the needs of economic and cultural construction in ethnic minority areas in the future.

    Continue to Pay Attention to Promoting Cadres
      Promoting outstanding members of ethnic minority cadres to assume various leadership positions is an extremely important measure for implementing ethnic regional autonomy and nationalizing autonomous organs. Only in this way can ethnic minorities truly be masters of their own affairs, can they better appreciate the equal political status between all ethnic groups, and can the Party's various policies be implemented more smoothly.

    Although many ethnic minority cadres have been promoted in various ethnic minority areas in the past few years, many ethnic minority areas should continue to promote ethnic minority cadres according to the needs of the development of various undertakings and the realization of the nationalization of organs, and according to the possible conditions. Some places need to promote more ethnic minority cadres. At present, special attention should be paid to promoting cadres in ethnic minority finance, industry, party affairs, and public security, and also to promoting ethnic minority women cadres and scattered ethnic minority cadres with very small populations, as well as ethnic minority cadres from different regions of the same ethnic group.

    The promotion of ethnic minority cadres should also be based on the standards of both morality and talent stipulated in the Party's cadre policy. However, we must proceed from the actual situation of different ethnic groups, and we cannot demand too much. In particular, we must prevent and overcome the phenomenon of comparing qualifications and discussing history with Han cadres. At the same time, we must also prevent and overcome the phenomenon of blindly promoting cadres without considering the needs and the conditions for the growth of ethnic minority cadres.

    Overcoming the Phenomenon of Having a Title Without Power
      At present, the phenomenon of some ethnic minority cadres having a title without power is still quite serious. Some ethnic minority cadres and the masses reflect that in their areas, ethnic minority cadres are nominally "in charge," but in reality, Han cadres are "in control." This phenomenon seriously hinders the realization of the right of ethnic minority autonomy and the smooth growth of ethnic minority cadres.

    The existence of the phenomenon of ethnic minority cadres having a title without power is mainly due to the fact that some Han cadres do not have enough trust and respect for ethnic minority cadres, and they take over and replace them in their work. Some individual Han cadres even discriminate against and exclude ethnic minority cadres. This requires continuing to conduct extensive and in-depth education on the Party's ethnic policy among Han cadres working in ethnic minority areas, and constantly summarizing experiences and lessons in their work. On the one hand, those Han cadres who have exemplary executed the Party's ethnic policy, who respect the powers of ethnic minority cadres, and who can help and unite with ethnic minority cadres should be appropriately commended; on the other hand, those comrades who have consciously or unconsciously committed errors of taking over and replacing them and who have a tendency of Han chauvinism should be helped to recognize their mistakes, so that they can consciously correct them on the basis of improving their policy and ideological level.

    The existence of the phenomenon of ethnic minority cadres having a title without power has other reasons as well. For example, in some areas, ethnic minority languages ​​are not widely used in work, which hinders ethnic minority cadres from smoothly exercising their powers; in some areas, too many Han cadres are assigned to certain organs, which objectively encourages Han cadres to take over and replace them in their work; and so on. Therefore, all regions must conduct specific analyses of the phenomenon of ethnic minority cadres having a title without power and propose concrete measures for correction.

    Allocate Cadres with Comprehensive Consideration
    Appropriate arrangements should also be made for cadres from other ethnic minorities within the autonomous area.

    That is to say, the requirements for the nationalization of organs in autonomous areas should not be generalized. In particular, the percentage of ethnic minority cadres should not be mechanically stipulated in a uniform manner. Instead, appropriate regulations should be made according to the specific circumstances of each different ethnic minority autonomous area, and gradually realized according to the conditions for cadre growth.

    Finally, under the premise of respecting the ethnic minorities' right to be masters of their own affairs, the assignment of necessary Han cadres to various tasks is not excluded in ethnic minority autonomous areas. Furthermore, a suitable proportion of Han cadres should also be assigned to leadership positions based on the Han population, their political rights, and with reference to the historical and current situation of domestic ethnic relations.

    培养少数民族干部工作中的若干问题
                    叶尚志
    几年来，我国培养少数民族干部的工作，取得了很大成绩，同时也还存在着许多问题。其中主要问题是：少数民族干部的数量和质量赶不上工作发展的需要，特别是领导骨干和专业技术人材还很缺乏，有些少数民族干部有职无权的现象还很严重，少数民族自治地方机关民族化的工作，有待进一步加强。
      增加少数民族干部
    少数民族地区的政治、经济和文化事业，随着全国社会主义革命和建设事业的发展，也在加速地发展着，这样各少数民族地区就越来越感到干部的不足。这种情况在那些正在进行大工业建设的地区（如内蒙古和新疆两个自治区）和其他一些工作进展较快的地区更加明显。根据1955年年底统计，全国汉族干部约占汉族人口的0.93％，而全国少数民族干部平均仅占到少数民族人口的0.59％。各少数民族地区，除了内蒙古自治区的少数民族干部占当地少数民族人口比例达到1.7％，吉林省达到1.3％以外，其他地区都低于汉族干部的比例，有的地区少数民族干部仅占少数民族人口的0.2％。造成这种情况的原因，有些地区主要是由于工作发展的历史较短和社会条件的限制；但是有些少数民族地区还是由于主观努力不够所致。很明显，有的少数民族地区社会条件并不落后于其他少数民族地区，甚至不落后于某些汉族地区，在这样的地区本来是可以培养出更多的少数民族干部的。因此，今后继续增加少数民族干部的数量，仍然是许多少数民族地区的一项重要的任务。
    增加少数民族干部的数量，主要来源有两方面：一方面是从高等学校、各种专业技术学校和其他学校的少数民族的学生和毕业生中吸收干部；另一方面，是充分注意从群众运动和各种建设事业中涌现出来的少数民族劳动群众的积极分子中吸收干部。此外，还要注意从少数民族的失学青年中、流散在社会上能够工作的旧知识分子和旧军政人员中吸收干部；有私营工商业的少数民族地区，还可以吸收公私合营后的资本家及其代理人和小业主等参加工作。对少数民族的上层人物和宗教人士也要妥善地进行安排。在吸收少数民族干部的时候，应该根据工作发展的需要，按照自力更生、就地取材的原则，作出具体计划，逐步地进行，既要防止操之过急和滥竽充数的偏向，也要防止不适当的过高要求，因而产生关门主义和保守主义的倾向。在精简机构、紧缩编制工作中，要注意防止随意裁减少数民族干部的现象发生，并且要注意根据少数民族地区的某些特殊需要（如需要翻译，安排各种上层人士，配备有关的各民族干部等），予以必要的照顾。
        提高干部质量
    提高少数民族干部的质量，是目前培养少数民族干部工作中的又一项重要任务。现在的问题是：要在已有的基础上，进一步给予少数民族干部以系统的政治的训练，并在这一基础上，使比较高级的少数民族干部，进行系统的马克思列宁主义的理论学习，并且注意培养少数民族的理论工作干部。只有做好这一工作，少数民族的共产主义干部才能更好地成长起来，而没有这样的干部，要解决少数民族问题是不可能的。同时，由于各项工作的日益发展，分工逐渐趋于细密，还要系统地帮助少数民族干部提高文化水平，丰富业务知识，使他们能够胜任愉快地做好工作。此外，还要重视培养少数民族的科学技术人材。这虽是一项长期的任务，但从现在起就要有计划地加强这方面的工作，以适应今后少数民族地区经济文化建设的需要。
    继续注意提拔干部
      提拔少数民族干部中的优秀分子担任各种领导工作，是实行民族区域自治和自治机关民族化的极其重要的措施，只有这样，少数民族才能真正当家作主，才能更加体会到各民族之间政治上的平等地位，也才能使党的各项政策更加顺利地贯彻执行。
    几年来各少数民族地区虽然提拔了很多少数民族干部，但是许多少数民族地区按照各项事业发展和实现机关民族化的需要，并根据可能条件，还应该继续提拔少数民族干部，有的地方还需要更多地提拔少数民族干部。目前特别应该注意提拔少数民族的财政、工业、党务和公安等方面工作的干部，并且也要注意提拔少数民族的妇女干部和散居的、人口很少的少数民族干部，以及同一民族不同地区的少数民族干部。
    提拔少数民族干部同样应根据党的干部政策中所规定的德才兼备的标准。但是要从不同民族的实际情况出发，不能要求过高，特别要防止和克服同汉族干部比资格、论历史的现象。同时也要防止和克服不根据需要和少数民族干部成长的条件，盲目提拔的现象。
    克服有职无权的现象
      目前有些少数民族干部有职无权的现象仍然相当严重。有些少数民族干部和群众反映：他们那里名义上是少数民族干部“当家”，实际上是汉族干部“作主”。这种现象严重地妨碍了少数民族自治权利的实现和少数民族干部的顺利成长。
    少数民族干部有职无权现象的存在，主要的原因是某些汉族干部对少数民族干部信任和尊重不够，在工作上包办代替，甚至个别的汉族干部还歧视和排斥少数民族干部。这就需要继续在派往少数民族地区工作的汉族干部中，广泛而深入地进行党的民族政策的教育，经常总结工作中的经验和教训。一方面要适当地表扬那些模范地执行党的民族政策，既尊重少数民族干部的职权，又能帮助和团结少数民族干部的汉族干部；另一方面要帮助那些在工作中自觉地或不自觉地犯有包办代替和有大汉族主义思想倾向的同志认识错误，以便他们在提高政策思想水平的基础上，自觉地纠正。
    少数民族干部有职无权现象的存在，还有其他一些原因，例如有的地区少数民族的语言文字没有在工作中广泛的使用，因而妨碍了少数民族干部顺利地行使自己的职权；有的地区由于某些机关汉族干部配备过多，在客观上助长了汉族干部在工作中包办代替；等等。因此，各地区必须对少数民族干部有职无权的现象，进行具体分析，提出纠正的具体措施。
    配备干部要全面照顾
    对于自治地方内的其他少数民族的干部，也应该有适当的配备。
    这就是说，自治地方机关民族化的要求，不应该一般化，特别是不能千篇一律地机械规定少数民族干部的百分比，而应该根据各个不同的少数民族自治地方的具体情况，作出适当的规定，并且根据干部成长的条件，逐步地予以实现。
    最后，在尊重少数民族当家作主的前提下，在少数民族自治地方不但不排除必要的汉族干部担任各种工作，而且也应该按照汉族人口情况和他们的政治权利，并参照国内民族关系的历史和现实情况，在领导工作岗位上配备适当比例的汉族干部。
