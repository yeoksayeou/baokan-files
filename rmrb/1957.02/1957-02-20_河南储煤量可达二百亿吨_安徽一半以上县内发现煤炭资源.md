    Henan's Coal Reserves May Reach 20 Billion Tons
    Coal Resources Discovered in More Than Half of Anhui's Counties
    (Our Dispatch) Henan Province has vast and rich coalfields. According to existing survey and exploration data and experts' estimates, within the area west of the Beijing-Hankou Railway, covering more than 30 counties and thousands of square kilometers, coal reserves are confidently estimated to reach 20 billion tons. Moreover, the coalfields may extend towards the eastern and northern Henan plains.
    Large-scale coalfield geological survey and exploration work in Henan Province began in 1953. Over the past few years, seven exploration teams have completed over 300,000 meters of drilling in eight exploration areas. Following the discovery of rich coking coal by Exploration Team 401 in the Pingdingshan area, Exploration Team 127 discovered lean coal needed for coking in the Hebi area, while Exploration Teams 426 and 126 discovered prime coking coal in Zhaochuan and Yiluo. Exploration Teams 125, 149, and 403, as well as the Provincial Department of Industry's Drilling Team, have also discovered coal for power generation and domestic use in Jiaozuo, Xin'an and Mianchi, Sanfengshan in Yuxian County, and Tianxianmiao in Mixian County, respectively. Currently, the state has six exploration teams and three geophysical prospecting teams, totaling more than 4,000 people, conducting coalfield exploration work in the Henan area year-round.
    According to data obtained by geological personnel from eight coalfield exploration areas, it has now been preliminarily proven that coalfields stretch across more than 30 counties from Pingdingshan in southwestern Henan to Hebi in northern Henan. Moreover, major coalfields are either connected or intermittently connected. These coalfields were mostly formed during the Carboniferous and Permian periods, with a few from the Jurassic period. Most coalfields have simple geological structures and are easy to mine. Chemical analysis has proven that prime coking coal, fat coal, and lean coal needed for steel smelting account for more than half of the province's total coal reserves; power coal needed for boilers, lignite needed for oil extraction, and high-grade domestic coal are also abundant. According to geological experts' estimates, the coalfields in western and northern Henan may extend towards the eastern and northern Henan plains.
    From 1953 to the present, coalfield geological exploration personnel have precisely surveyed coal reserves of 2.2 billion tons for the state. The precisely surveyed reserves can supply more than 30 pairs of large and medium-sized modern mines with an annual output of 300,000 to 1.2 million tons. The precisely surveyed reserves can basically meet the needs of Henan's coal mine construction in the next few years.
    (Our Dispatch) Coal resources have been discovered in more than half of the counties in Anhui Province. According to data already obtained by the Heavy Industry Bureau of the Anhui Provincial Department of Industry, coal seams have been confirmed in 40 counties, and people have reported coal mines in eight counties, but no further exploration has been conducted.
    In Anhui Province, four geological exploration teams from the central government and the provincial Department of Industry are exploring coal reserves this year. In addition to the original coal-rich Huainan coalfield, a large coalfield with reserves of over 100 million tons has been discovered in the Huaibei Plain. These coalfields are distributed in Lieshan and Leijiagou in Suixi County, Baituzhai in Xiaoxian County, and Woyang, Mengcheng, and Fengtai counties. Some areas have already begun drilling and surveying. In the hilly areas on both sides of the Yangtze River in Anhui, most counties also have small coalfields, many of which have been mined by farmers in the past.
    This year, Anhui Province also plans to develop 100,000 to 110,000 tons of coal using indigenous methods in more than 20 small coal mines. In addition to supplying domestic and handicraft use in the province, these coals will also supply some domestic coal to Shanghai and Nanjing.

### 河南储煤量可达二百亿吨  安徽一半以上县内发现煤炭资源

    河南储煤量可达二百亿吨
    安徽一半以上县内发现煤炭资源
    本报讯　河南省煤田辽阔而又富饶。根据现有普查勘探资料和专家们的推断，在京汉铁路以西的三十多个县、纵横数千平方公里范围内，煤储量有把握达到二百亿吨。而且煤田有可能向豫东和豫北平原延伸。
    河南全省大规模煤田地质普查勘探工作开始于1953年。几年来，七个勘探队在八个勘探区内已经完成了三十多万公尺的钻探任务。继四○一勘探队在平顶山地区探到了丰富的炼焦煤以后，一二七勘探队在鹤壁地区探到了炼焦需要的瘦煤，四二六、一二六勘探队在朝川和宜洛探到了主焦煤，一二五、一四九、四○三勘探队和省工业厅钻探队也分别在焦作、新安和渑池、禹县三峰山、密县天仙庙等地区，探到了动力用煤和民用煤。目前，国家在河南地区长年进行煤田勘探工作的有六个勘探队和三个物理探矿队，共有四千多人。
    根据地质人员从八个煤田勘探区获得的资料，目前已经初步证明，从豫西南的平顶山到豫北北部的鹤壁，煤田绵延三十多个县，而且各大煤田均互相接连或者断续接连。这些煤田形成的年代多为石炭纪和二叠纪，也有少数为侏罗纪。大多数煤田地质构造简单易采。煤质经过化验证明，冶炼钢铁需要的主焦煤、肥煤和瘦煤，约占全省煤炭总储量一半以上；燃烧锅炉需用的动力煤、提炼石油需用的褐煤和高级民用煤也很丰富。根据地质专家们的推断，豫西和豫北的煤田均有可能向豫东和豫北平原延伸。
    煤田地质勘探人员从1953年起到目前，已经为国家精查的煤储量达二十二亿吨。精查储量可供设计年产三十万吨到一百二十万吨的大、中型现代化矿井三十多对。精查的储量基本上可以适应今后几年河南煤矿建设的需要。
    本报讯　安徽省一半以上的县境内都发现了煤炭资源。据安徽省工业厅重工业局已掌握的资料，四十个县份内证实有煤层，八个县内群众报告有煤矿，不过还没有进一步探勘。
    在安徽省境内，今年有中央和省工业厅的四个地质探勘队勘探煤炭埋藏量。安徽省除了原有的煤藏量丰富的淮南煤田以外，在淮北平原已探到大块煤田，埋藏量在亿吨以上。这些煤田分布在濉溪县的烈山、雷家沟，萧县的白土寨，涡阳、蒙城和凤台县。有的地区已开始了钻探普查等工作。在安徽长江两岸的丘陵地带，大部分县内也都有小块煤田，其中许多煤层在历史上已有农民开采过。
    今年，安徽省还计划在二十多个小窑煤矿内，发展土法开采十万到十一万吨煤炭。这些煤炭除供应本省民用与手工业使用外，还将供应上海、南京地区一部分民用煤。
