Comrade Xiyun! Old comrade-in-arms! You have left us forever!

We met twenty-six years ago. For twenty-six years, whether we were together or apart, it always felt like something connected our hearts.

Down in Jinggang Mountain, during those years of arduous struggle, you demonstrated infinite loyalty and courage towards the revolutionary cause. Amidst the enemy's heavy blockade and encirclement, we couldn't get salt, we didn't have cotton clothes, and when we got sick or injured, there was no medicine to cure us; the gun barrels lacked bullets, the warehouses lacked grain, and the banks had no currency. The struggle was arduous. You worked selflessly, never sparing your life and energy. How happy and joyful you were whenever you overcame a difficulty and completed a task! All of this was nothing but hardship for you; it was just your university course, something necessary and indispensable in your life. You had only one goal: to rely on the Party, rely on the masses, defeat the enemy, and carry the revolution through to the end.

During the Long March, in the snowy mountains and grasslands, you took the hardships first and rested last. In those days of eating wild grass and boiling leather belts, on those snow-capped mountains thousands of meters above sea level with thin air, in those uninhabited grasslands for hundreds of miles, in those days and nights of dealing with the enemy and marching without rest, you always toiled selflessly, doing your best to save one more soldier. The struggle was extremely arduous, and victory was bought with countless sacrifices. We advanced, treading on the bloodstains of our comrades; we advanced, stepping over the corpses of our comrades. We were always ready to let our comrades tread on our bloodstains and step over our corpses; we firmly believed that victory would surely belong to us.

During the War of Resistance Against Japan, you were in the Jin-Sui liberated area, and I was in a Xinjiang prison. You ate black beans and bran, while we ate rotten sorghum flour and clear soup. You fought hard against the enemy on the front lines, sacrificing and shedding blood; we suffered torture under the enemy's cruel punishments in prison, also sacrificing and shedding blood. Although we were thousands of miles apart, there was always something that connected our hearts. We had a common goal: to strive for the liberation of the working people, to strive for the freedom and independence of the motherland, and to strive for socialism.

You dedicated your life to revolution, engaging in revolutionary struggle and construction for thirty years. You left behind no secret formulas, no inventions, and no written works. Yet, the life of a revolutionary is worth learning from. We must always learn from you.

You were not a hero or a great figure, nor were you a prophet; you were not a superman, nor were you a sage. You were an ordinary soldier—a servant of the Chinese people. You were an ordinary Communist Party member, wholeheartedly dedicated to the revolution, burying yourself in hard work, willingly remaining unknown, sparing no effort, fearing no sacrifice, truly "giving your all until your heart stops beating."

You were not skilled in writing, you were not given to grand speeches, you would not cover up your mistakes, you would not act clever, you would not think highly of yourself, and you would not be overbearing.

You were a cell in the revolutionary organism, a screw in the revolutionary machine. A cell dies after fulfilling its growth function, and a screw wears out after fulfilling its purpose, letting countless new cells and new screws replace them.

Rest in peace, Comrade Xiyun! Those who will take your place, the younger generation than us, will surpass us. They will be better at fighting, better at working, and better at learning. "The student surpasses the teacher," as the ancients said.

As you were about to pass away, your hand held mine tightly, and your eyes were filled with tears. Comrade Xiyun! I understand you! I know what you were thinking and what you wanted to say. You were reluctant to part with everything you loved! You loved life, you loved work, you loved the motherland, you loved all your comrades-in-arms, you loved socialism, you loved your wife and children. Comrade Xiyun! Rest in peace! Our life is advancing, the motherland is advancing, our comrades-in-arms are advancing, and socialism is advancing! The Party will care for your wife and children, the people will care for them, and your comrades will care for them.

Rest in peace, Comrade Xiyun! I will faithfully carry out your entrustment: to raise and educate your children well.

(Editor's note: Comrade Chen Xiyun joined the revolution in 1927 and was a formal member of the Chinese Communist Party. He served as the Minister of Supply of the Second Army Corps of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, the 120th Division of the Eighth Route Army, the Minister of the Logistics Department of the Northwest Military Region and Southwest Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the Deputy Director of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Southwest Military and Political Committee, the Minister of Finance, and the Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Food of the People's Republic of China. He passed away on February 6th at Peking Union Medical College Hospital due to incurable gallbladder cancer.)

    悼希云同志	张子意
    希云同志！老战友！你同我们永别了！
    我们是在二十六年以前认识的。二十六年来，不管我们是相聚或者分离，总像有什么东西把我们彼此的心联结在一起。
    在井岗山下，在那些艰苦斗争的岁月里，你表现了对革命事业的无限忠诚，无限勇气。在敌人的重重封锁和包围当中，我们吃不到咸盐，穿不上棉衣，病了、伤了没有药医；枪膛里缺少子弹，仓库里缺少粮食，银行里没有货币。斗争是艰苦的。你忘我地努力工作，从来不吝惜自己的生命和精力，每当你克服一种困难，完成一项任务的时候，你是多么幸福，多么愉快呵！这一切对于你，算不了什么艰难困苦；这不过是你的大学课程，是你的生活中必需的、不可缺少的东西。你只有一个目的：依靠党、依靠群众，战胜敌人，革命到底。
    在长征中，在雪山草地，你吃苦在前，休息在后。在那些吃野草、煮皮带的日子里，在那些空气稀薄、拔海数千公尺的雪山顶上，在那些千里无人烟的草地里，在那些同敌人周旋、行军不歇的昼夜里，你总是忘我地操劳，为了多保存一个战士而尽自己的最大的努力。斗争是十分艰苦的，胜利是由无数的牺牲换来的。我们是踏着同志们的血迹前进的，我们是跨过同志们的尸体前进的。我们时刻准备着，让同志们踏着自己的血迹前进，让同志们跨过自己的尸体前进；我们坚信，胜利一定是属于我们的。
    在抗日战争时期，你在晋绥解放区，我在新疆监狱里。你们吃的是黑豆、糠皮，我们吃的是腐臭的高粱面和清汤白水。你们在前线同敌人艰苦战斗，牺牲流血；我们在狱中受敌人的毒刑拷打，也在牺牲流血。我们彼此相隔数千里，但总是有什么东西把我们彼此的心联结在一起。我们有着共同的目标：争取劳动人民的解放，争取祖国的自由、独立，争取社会主义。
    你终身以革命为职业，三十年来从事革命斗争和建设事业。你没有遗留下什么秘方，没有遗留下什么发明创造，没有遗留下什么著作。然而一个革命者的一生，毕竟是值得学习的。我们要永远地向你学习。
    你不是英雄豪杰，也不是先知先觉；你不是超人，也不是圣贤。你是一个普通的战士——中国人民的仆人。你是一个平凡的共产党员，全心全意献身革命、埋头苦干、自甘没没无闻的人，不吝惜自己的精力、不怕任何牺牲、所谓鞠躬尽瘁的人。
    你不会舞文弄墨，你不会高谈阔论，你不会文过饰非，你不会自作聪明，你不会自命不凡，你不会盛气凌人。
    你是革命有机体内的一个细胞，你是革命队伍里的一个螺丝钉。细胞尽了自己的生长机能以后便会死去，螺丝钉尽了自己的作用以后就被磨损，让那无数新的细胞与新的螺丝钉来补充。
    安息吧！希云同志！来接替你的、比我们年轻一代的人，是会胜过我们的。他们比我们会更善于战斗，更善于工作，更善于学习。“青出于蓝而胜于蓝”，这是古人说过的道理。
    在你将要临终的时候，你的手还紧紧地握住我的手不放，你的眼中还含着泪水。希云同志！我了解你！你在想什么和你要说什么，我是知道的。你是在留恋你所爱过的一切啊！你爱生活，你爱工作，你爱祖国，你爱所有的战友，你爱社会主义，你爱你的妻子和儿女。希云同志！安息吧！我们的生活在前进，祖国在前进，战友们在前进，社会主义在前进！你的妻子和儿女，党会关怀他们，人民会关怀他们，同志们会关怀他们。
    安息吧！希云同志！我要忠实地执行你的委托：好好地抚育教养你的儿女。
      （编者注：陈希云同志1927年参加革命，是中国共产党正式党员。历任中国工农红军二军团、八路军一二○师供给部部长，中国人民解放军西北军区、西南军区后勤部部长和西南军政委员会财政经济委员会副主任、财政部部长，中华人民共和国粮食部副部长等职。因患胆囊癌症久治无效，于2月6日在北京协和医院逝世。）
