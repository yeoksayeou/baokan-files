Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The Ministerial Council meeting of the Organization for European Economic Cooperation (OEEC) was held in Paris on the 12th to discuss the "Free Trade Area" plan proposed by Britain. The meeting hastily concluded late on the 13th.

In addition to ministers and experts from the seventeen member countries of the OEEC, including Britain, France, West Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Austria, Greece, Turkey, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, Portugal, Iceland, and Ireland, representatives from the United States, Canada, Spain, and Yugoslavia also attended the meeting.

The biggest contentious issue facing this meeting was whether the "Free Trade Area" should include agricultural products. Britain, unwilling to harm its relations with the Commonwealth countries that export most of their agricultural products to Britain, insisted that agricultural products should not be included in the "Free Trade Area." However, most of the national representatives who spoke at the meeting insisted on including agricultural products in the "Free Trade Area." Agricultural countries such as Ireland, Austria, and Denmark were particularly dissatisfied with Britain's proposal, believing that the "Free Trade Area" would be of no benefit to them otherwise.

The head of the US delegation, Economic Cooperation Administrator Hollister, said at the meeting that the United States has always supported European "unity" and the abolition of tariffs.

At the same time, sources say the United States fears that the current plan may be used to prevent low-cost American goods from being sold to Europe.

The meeting decided to establish three committees of experts to continue negotiations in order to draft a treaty on the establishment of a "Free Trade Area" by the end of July. Regarding the issue of whether agricultural products should be included in the "Free Trade Area," the meeting decided to task the experts with finding "methods and means to ensure the expansion of trade in agricultural products on a non-discriminatory basis" in the future drafting of the "Free Trade Area" treaty.

Regarding the relationship between the "Free Trade Area" and the "Common Market," the meeting's resolution required that the negotiations determine "on a multilateral basis" the methods and means of linking this market with other member countries of the OEEC.

    在欧洲经济合作局理事会议上
    英国“自由贸易区”计划引起分歧
    美国担心美国货要受到欧洲的抵制
    据新华社讯　欧洲经济合作局部长理事会会议12日在巴黎举行会议，讨论英国所提出的“自由贸易区”计划。会议已于13日深夜匆匆结束。
    参加这次会议的除欧洲经济合作局的成员国英、法、西德、意大利、比利时、荷兰、卢森堡、奥地利、希腊、土耳其、丹麦、挪威、瑞典、瑞士、葡萄牙、冰岛、爱尔兰等十七国的部长和专家外，还有美国、加拿大、西班牙和南斯拉夫的代表。
    这次会议面临的最大的争执问题，是“自由贸易区”是否包括农产品在内。英国由于不愿损害它同向英国输入大部农产品的联邦国家的关系，坚持农产品不应包括在“自由贸易区”内。但是，在会上发言的大部分国家代表都坚持在“自由贸易区”内包括农产品。爱尔兰、奥地利、丹麦这些农业国家特别不满英国的主张，认为这样一来“自由贸易区”对它们就没有好处。
    美国代表团团长、经济合作署署长霍利斯特在会上说，美国一直赞成欧洲“统一”和废除关税。
    同时，有消息说，美国担心目前的计划可能被利用来制止成本低廉的美国货销到欧洲去。
    会议决定成立三个专家委员会继续进行谈判，以便在7月底以前拟出关于建立“自由贸易区”的条约草案。关于农产品是否包括进“自由贸易区”的问题，会议决定责成专家们今后在“自由贸易区”条约的起草工作中，设法找出一些“方法和手段来保证在不歧视的基础上扩大农产品方面的贸易”。
    关于“自由贸易区”和“共同市场”的联系问题，会议的决议要求在谈判中决定“在多边基础上”把这个市场和欧洲经济合作局其他成员国联系起来的方法和手段。
