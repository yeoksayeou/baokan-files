    In the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture
    By our reporter Ji Xichen
    First Entering Liangshan
    On the morning of November 16th, we left Xichang, a city of perpetual spring, and headed east towards Zhaojue along the newly built Yixi Highway, facing the rising sun. After passing through the green fields along the edge of Qionghai Lake, we soon began to climb over the Yaozhanpo Mountain, which rises 3,200 meters above sea level. In the steep Hengduan Mountains, the jeep sped for more than 40 kilometers before reaching the misty summit and entering the western border of the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture. From here eastward, it is all inhabited by the Yi people.
    Looking east, I saw undulating mountains, deep valleys, and brown-yellow grassy slopes and shrubs, with herds of horses, pigs, and cattle roaming about. Yi villages were scattered sparsely on the hillsides along the road. Although some villages had only a few households, they were all surrounded by village walls, with tall watchtowers standing at the corners of the courtyards.
    The shape of the houses here is similar to that of the Han people, but because there are no bricks and tiles, the roofs are mostly made of wooden "tiles" sawn from wood, with stones pressed all over them, without using any iron nails at all.
    When the car crossed the hills and entered the canyon, the road was full of scenes of harvest: golden crops were stacked in bundles in the fields. Before coming to Liangshan, we always thought it must be very cold in this area 2,000 to 3,000 meters above sea level, but in reality, it is not like that. Although it is windy most of the time, it is still quite warm on sunny days.
    On the Road
    The news of the arrival of the Central Delegation spread like a warm spring breeze among the clan branches of Liangshan [Note 1]. Whenever the convoy passed a place, we could hear the Yi men and women shouting back and forth from the mountains on both sides from afar.
    "What are they shouting?"
    "They are shouting, 'The people of Chairman Mao are here, the people of Chairman Mao are here,'" said the translator.
    With that heart-stirring shout, the mountains and fields suddenly boiled over. As far as the eye could see, groups of Yi men and women, barefoot, leaping forward, surged towards the highway from the hillsides, valleys, villages, and fields. Men wearing "Charwa" [Note 2] and sporting "Tian Pusa" [Note 3], women wearing headscarves and multi-pleated long skirts, and children running around in the crowd, all waved their arms and shouted fervently, "Mao Zhuxi Wawaku!" (Long live Chairman Mao!)
    The members of the Sikai Agricultural Cooperative, holding rice ears in their hands, squeezed out of the crowd and presented their first harvest to the Central Delegation. Li Yuesuoge, the head of the cooperative, was a "Guozhuang Waizi" who had been a slave for more than 20 years and had suffered all kinds of torture from slave owners. After the democratic reforms, he and 36 freed slaves and semi-slaves organized an agricultural cooperative, initially improving production and increasing the yield of more than 100 mu of crops by more than 20%. He shook the hand of a member of the delegation and said excitedly:
    "Ke sha sha! Ke sha sha! (Thank you! Thank you!) Please tell Chairman Mao that our ancestors have only had their own harvest this year!"
    In recent years, with the comprehensive assistance of the autonomous prefectural government in the form of loans, relief, winter clothing, housing repairs, and the distribution of free agricultural implements, the lives of the Yi people have improved significantly. However, due to the extremely backward level of production, the people's lives are still very poor. Many of them are still scantily clad, some bare-chested, wearing only a rough sheepskin; buckwheat, corn, potatoes, wild vegetables, and garden roots are the people's main food. Because the grain produced in this area is only enough to eat for about eight or nine months a year, about one-third of their rations have to be supplied by the Han areas and subsidized by the People's Government.
    The poverty of the Yi people, although inseparable from the backward social system and internal feuds, is also mainly due to the brutal suppression and "encirclement" by the reactionary rulers of the past.
    According to the Xichang County Chronicle, the reactionary rulers of the past invariably used the Dadu River and the Jinsha River as natural barriers to the north and south, built bunkers around Liangshan, and stationed heavy troops to trap the Yi people in the deep mountains and old forests. Under the reactionary propaganda of "to have a peaceful year, unless you kill the Yi," "seeing a Yi is three parts guilt," they constantly incited ethnic hatred between the Yi and Han people. At the same time, they created a series of bloody massacres through large-scale armed offensives and by provoking internal feuds among the Yi people. For example, in the nineteenth year of Emperor Guangwu of the Eastern Han Dynasty, Zhang Qiao sent troops to suppress the Yi people. In the third year of the Jianxing period of the Shu Han Dynasty, Zhuge Liang led his troops on a southern expedition and captured and released Meng Huo seven times. Liangshan still has Meng Huo Mountain to this day. During the Tang and Song dynasties, the once-powerful Yi people advanced into the Chengdu and Qionglai areas, forcing the Song Dynasty to demarcate the Dadu River as the boundary. The offensives against the Yi people became even more frequent during the Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, with tens of thousands of troops dispatched each time. From 1945 to 1946, the Kuomintang reactionaries' suppression of the Yi people in Liangshan shook China and foreign countries. In that offensive, the Kuomintang reactionaries mobilized more than 10,000 troops and dispatched three aircraft, and the war lasted for more than a year. Under the barbaric burning, killing, and looting, no human habitation could be seen for dozens of miles around Puxiong and Yuexi. In this one event, the Guoji family alone lost more than 96,000 taels of silver, which greatly damaged the agricultural and pastoral production of the Yi people.
    The years of feuds among the Yi people also made the social order in Liangshan constantly turbulent. A Yi "Qunuo" [Note 4] recalled the social situation at that time:
    "In the past, we had to keep watch when we farmed, we dared not open windows in our houses, we had to sleep with guns in our arms, we dared not let cattle and sheep graze far away, and we could not go more than ten li away from home. But now, we no longer have to worry and fear, we can go wherever we want, and everyone can live in peace and contentment."
    Arriving at Zhaojue
    We arrived at Zhaojue City, the seat of the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture People's Committee, at around 3:00 p.m.
    The wide plain on the banks of the Zhaojue River was filled with a festive atmosphere. In the welcoming ranks of people dressed in various costumes were Yi primary school students wearing red scarves, militiamen armed with guns and bullet belts, thousands of freed slaves, and upper-class people who had been properly resettled by the government. When Deputy Chief Wang Yifu told everyone that the Central Government and Chairman Mao were always concerned about the Yi people and grateful to them for helping the Red Army during the Long March, a long-lasting cheer rang out again from the boiling crowd.
    Zhaojue, the capital of Liangshan, which had repeatedly resisted the Qing Dynasty and the Kuomintang reactionary rulers, had only a few households in 1950. It was a desolate and small castle where "four gates can talk to each other, and one lamp illuminates the whole city," and it was also a prison for the reactionary rulers to suppress the Yi people of Liangshan. Since Zhao Erfeng, the governor of Sichuan, built the city in the second year of the reign of Emperor Xuantong of the Qing Dynasty, many Yi compatriots have been imprisoned in the castle every year. However, now it has become the political, economic, and cultural center of Liangshan. In the new urban area, which is two li long, wide roads have been opened up, and new buildings have been built one after another. Accompanied by joyful songs and harmonica sounds, the streets and alleys are crowded with smiling Yi people. Some of them are drinking together in the streets, while others are carrying furs, medicinal materials, and other local products for sale to the trade companies and cooperatives, buying back cloth, salt, agricultural implements, and other means of production and daily necessities.
    In the office building of the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture People's Committee, I visited Wazha Muji, the head of the autonomous prefecture. He was so simple, unadorned, humble, and enthusiastic, always wearing a simple ethnic costume, and his large, keen eyes were shining. He joined the Communist Party of China before liberation and is now the Minister of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Liangshan Prefectural Committee. I asked him to talk about the construction and changes in the Yi Autonomous Prefecture in recent years. He said: "Like other fraternal ethnic groups, in the big family of all ethnic groups in the motherland, our Yi people have forever been freed from ethnic discrimination and oppression and enjoy true equality. In recent years, under the leadership of the Party and with the fraternal support of the Han people, the politics, economy, and culture of the Yi people in Liangshan have all made considerable progress. With the thorough implementation of the Party's ethnic policy, the serious situation of ethnic estrangement and disunity within the Yi people that has been left over from history has now also undergone fundamental changes."
    Changes in the Past and Present
    Head Wazha Muji said: In order to meet the needs of various construction undertakings in the Liangshan area, the Party and government organs of the autonomous prefecture have trained and cultivated a large number of Yi cadres. At present, there are about 1,500 Yi cadres in the administrative organs, trade, banking, health, and other departments of the autonomous prefecture, undertaking various tasks. There are two schools in Zhaojue and Leibo dedicated to training ethnic cadres. The more than 480 students who recently graduated from the Zhaojue Ethnic Cadre School were mostly slaves and semi-slaves in the past. After studying the history of social development and the basic knowledge of the Party, they have raised their class consciousness, and many of them have joined the Party and become ethnic cadres with communist ideas.
    In the past, there were no cities, market towns, ethnic markets, or professional merchants in the Yi society of Liangshan. Commodity exchange mainly occurred between the Yi and Han people, and this transaction was extremely unreasonable. A few eggs could only be exchanged for a needle, and fifty or sixty jin of grain could only be exchanged for one jin of salt. Therefore, at that time, the Yi people could not afford salt, and many people had never worn a piece of cloth clothing in their lives. Now, 66 ethnic trade organizations have been established throughout the region. According to statistics, from January to October 1956 alone, more than 480,000 pieces of iron and wooden agricultural implements and utensils were supplied to the people, and the value of salt, wine, and oil supplied reached 14.94 million yuan. With the reduction in the prices of industrial products and the increase in the purchase prices of local and special products, the exchange ratio has undergone tremendous changes. In addition, with the implementation of democratic reforms, the purchasing power of the people has increased significantly. Compared with the actual sales of goods in 1955 and 1956, the average annual consumption of wide cloth per person in the region has increased from 5.44 chi to 17.1 chi; coarse cloth has increased from 13.85 chi to 22.68 chi; and salt has increased from 3.5 jin to more than 4.3 jin (including salt for livestock). These figures vividly show the improvement in people's lives.
    The Yi people originally had a syllabic script (old Yi script), but because of the small number of characters and the many variants, the people generally did not know how to read except for a few "Bimo" shamans. Now, with the help of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, a new pinyin script of their own has been created for the Yi people. Because this new script is easy to learn and master, 8,000 to 9,000 people have already learned it, which is a great joy in the history of the Yi people.
    Cultural and educational undertakings have also developed. According to the statistics of twelve counties, there was only one primary school in the whole region before liberation, but now there are 112 primary schools with more than 14,000 students. In addition, there are two ethnic rapid teacher training schools. In the past, people relied on shamans to curse ghosts and kill chickens and sheep to treat diseases; now, many counties have established health and medical institutions to provide free medical treatment for the people.
    Liangshan, where transportation has always been very inconvenient, did not even have goat trails in many places before liberation, and people would fall off cliffs if they were not careful when traveling. Now, wide post roads and convenient roads have been built between counties, districts, and townships. The most exciting thing is that the Yixi Highway, which runs through the heartland of Greater and Lesser Liangshan, has been fully opened to traffic, and various means of production and daily necessities are continuously transported along this happy avenue.
    "However, the greatest change for the Yi people lies in the implementation of democratic reforms." Head Wazha Muji continued, "After the earth-shaking social reforms of 1956, more than 600,000 slaves and laborers have become masters of their own affairs. After obtaining land and gaining personal freedom, they have organized cooperatives and mutual aid groups, skipping over the historical stages of feudal society and capitalist society, and joyfully embarking on the road of socialism."
    [Note 1] "Jia Zhi" refers to the clan branches formed by patrilineal blood ties in the Liangshan Yi society. The "Jia" of the same ancestor is further divided into many branches, such as the Luo Hong family, the A Hou family, and the Ba Qie family. Each family has its own territory and sphere of influence.
    [Note 2] "Charwa" is a kind of clothing similar to a "cloak" worn by the Yi people, made of wool yarn, which is cold-resistant, windproof, and rainproof.
    [Note 3] "Tian Pusa" is a tuft of hair left on the top of the head by Yi men, which is considered to be the place where the gods reside, and outsiders cannot touch it casually.
    [Note 4] "Qunuo" is a class in the Yi society. They rely on their own labor, occupy a certain amount of means of production, and have greater personal freedom. Their food and clothing can basically be self-sufficient. During the democratic reforms, they were collectively referred to as laborers. (Attached pictures)
    Yike Mu, a member of the Liangshan Zhaojue Unity Agricultural Cooperative, and her family used to be slaves to slave owners. After the democratic reforms, the whole family was reunited, and the children also went to primary school. This is a group photo of their whole family.
    This is the newly built Renmin Road in Zhaojue after liberation. Many new buildings have been built on both sides of the street, forming a new city.

    在凉山彝族自治州里
    本报记者　纪希晨
    初进凉山
    11月16日清晨，我们离开四季如春的西昌，沿着新修的宜西公路，迎着朝阳，往东向昭觉进发。穿过邛海边沿的绿色原野，走不远，就开始翻越拔海三千二百公尺的腰斩坡山。在陡峻的横断山脉间，吉普车奔驰了四十多公里，才上到云雾飘渺的顶巅，进入了凉山彝族自治州的西部边界。从这里往东，就全是彝族人民的聚居区了。
    我往东望去，只见到处都是起伏的山岭，深峭的沟谷，褐黄色的草坡和灌木丛中，出没着成群的马匹、猪只和牛羊。路边的山坡上，零星地散布着彝民的村庄。有些村寨虽然只有几户人家，但也都围筑着寨墙，高高的炮楼屹立在院角上。
    这里的房屋形状，同汉族的差不多，只因没有砖瓦，所以，屋顶多用木头锯成的“瓦板”盖成，板上再遍压石头，根本不用铁钉。
    车子翻过山岗，进入峡谷的时候，一路上，满眼都是丰收的景象：金黄色的庄稼，成捆地堆在田野上。未到凉山以前，我们总以为在这拔海两三千公尺的地方，一定非常寒冷，实际上却不是这样。刮风的时间虽然较多，但在晴朗的日子里，仍然相当暖和。
    在路上
    中央慰问团到来的消息，像一阵和暖的春风，传播在凉山的氏族家支中〔注一〕。每当车队路过一个地方，老远便听到彝族男女在两边山头上，一呼一应的呼喊声。
    “他们喊的什么？”
    “毛主席的人来了，毛主席的人来了。”翻译同志说。
    随着那动人心弦的喊声，山野里顿时沸腾起来了。眼睛所能望到的地方，一群群的彝族男女，光着脚，跃着箭步，从山坡上、沟谷里、村寨内、田野上，向公路奔涌过来。披着“查尔瓦”〔注二〕、头上蓄着“天菩萨”〔注三〕的男子，顶着头帕、穿着多褶长裙的妇女，和在那人群中乱钻的孩子们，一齐挥着手臂，狂热地喊着“毛主席瓦瓦库！”（毛主席万岁！）
    四开农业合作社的社员们，手捧着稻穗，从人群中挤了过来，把他们第一次的收获，敬献给中央慰问团。社长李曰所格是个当了二十多年奴隶的“锅庄娃子”，饱受过奴隶主的各种折磨。民主改革后，他同三十六户解放了的奴隶、半奴隶，组织了一个农业社，初步改进了生产，使一百多亩庄稼普遍增产了20％多。他紧握着慰问团团员的手，激动地说：
    “客沙沙！客沙沙！（谢谢！谢谢！）请告诉毛主席，我们祖祖辈辈，只有今年才有了自己的收成呵！”
    几年来，彝族人民在自治州政府贷款、救济、发寒衣、修房屋和发放无偿农具的全面帮助下，生活虽然有了不少改善，可是，由于原来生产水平的极端落后，所以，人民生活至今还是十分贫苦。他们之中不少人还都衣不蔽体，有的光着胸膛，身上只披一件粗羊皮；荞麦、包谷、洋芋、野菜、园根是人民的主要食品。由于本区所产粮食，一年仅够吃八九个月左右，所以，他们三分之一的口粮，差不多都要靠汉族地区供应和人民政府来救济。
    彝族人民的贫困，虽然是同落后的社会制度和内部的冤家械斗分不开的，但是历代反动统治者的残酷镇压和“围剿”也是主要原因之一。
    根据西昌县志的记载，历代反动统治者莫不以大渡河和金沙江为南北天然封锁线，在凉山四周高筑碉堡，派驻重兵，把彝族围困于深山老林中。他们在“要过太平年，除非蛮杀蛮”，“见彝不整三分罪”等等反动理论宣传下，不断煽动彝汉间的民族仇恨。同时，并以大规模的武装进攻，和挑拨彝族内部打冤家的方法，制造了一系列的血腥屠杀。例如东汉光武十九年，张乔曾派兵进剿彝族。蜀汉建兴三年，诸葛亮率兵南征，七擒七纵孟获，凉山至今还有孟获山。唐、宋年间，一度强大的彝族，曾进兵成都、邛崃一带，迫使宋朝划大渡河为界。元，明、清三代，对彝族的进攻更加频繁，每次出兵动辄数万。1945年至1946年，国民党反动派进剿凉山彝族的事件，更是震动中外。在那次进攻中，国民党反动派曾动员了一万多军队，派出三架飞机，战争延续了一年多。在野蛮的烧杀抢掠下，普雄、越嶲一带，数十里看不到人烟。这一次，仅果基家一个家支，就损失了银锭九万六千多两，使彝族的农牧业生产受到了极大的摧残。
    彝族内部连年的冤家械斗，也使凉山社会秩序经常动荡不安。一个彝族“曲诺”〔注四〕对当时的社会情景，曾这样回忆说：
    “从前，我们种地要放哨，住屋不敢开窗子，睡觉要抱着枪，牛羊不敢远放，出门不能走十里远。可是，现在呢，我们再不用担惊受怕了，想到那里就到那里，人人都可以安居乐业地生活了。”
    到昭觉
    我们在下午三点多钟，到达了凉山彝族自治州人民委员会的所在地——昭觉城。
    昭觉河畔的宽阔平坝上，充满了节日的景象。在那穿着各色盛装的人们的欢迎行列里，有戴着红领巾的彝族小学生，有肩着枪，缠着子弹带的民兵武装，有成千解放了的奴隶，也有得到政府妥善安置的上层人士。当王一夫副总团长向大家说到，中央和毛主席时时刻刻都在关怀着彝族人民，并感激他们帮助了红军长征的时候，沸腾的人群中，再次响起长久的欢呼声。
    昭觉，这个曾多次反抗清朝和国民党反动统治者的凉山首府，1950年时只有几户人家。是一个“四门可通话，一灯照全城”的荒凉狭小的城堡，同时也是反动统治者镇压凉山彝族人民的监狱。自清宣统二年川督赵尔丰筑城以来，年年都有许多彝胞被关押城堡中。然而，现在它已成为凉山政治、经济、文化的中心了。在那长达两里的新市区内，开辟了宽阔的马路，盖起了一幢幢的新房，伴着欢乐的歌声和口琴声，街头巷尾，拥聚着喜笑盈盈的彝胞。他们有的在街上一块围着饮酒，有的则背着出卖的皮张、药材等土特产品，到贸易公司和合作社里，买回布、盐、农具等生产和生活用品。
    在凉山彝族自治州人民委员会的办公楼里，我访问了自治州的瓦渣木基州长。他是那样质朴无华，谦虚热情，无论什么时候都穿着一身简朴的民族服装，大而敏锐的眼睛炯炯有光。他在解放前加入了中国共产党，现在是中共凉山地委的统战部长。我请他谈一谈彝族自治州近年来的建设和变化，他说：“像其他兄弟民族一样，在祖国各民族的大家庭里，我们彝族人民永远摆脱了民族歧视和压迫，享受了真正的平等。几年来，在党的领导下，在汉族兄弟般的支援下，凉山彝族的政治、经济、文化都获得了相当的发展。随着党的民族政策的贯彻执行，历史上留下来的民族隔阂和彝族内部不团结的严重情况，现在也有了根本的改变。”
    今昔变化
    瓦渣木基州长说：为了适应凉山地区各项建设事业的需要，自治州党政机关大量训练培养了彝族干部。现在，在自治州的各级行政机关，贸易、银行、卫生等部门里，有一千五百名左右彝族干部担负着各项工作。在昭觉和雷波并设有两处专门培养民族干部的学校。昭觉民族干部学校新近毕业的四百八十多个学生，过去大都是奴隶、半奴隶，在学习社会发展史和党的基本知识以后，提高了阶级觉悟，许多人都加入了党，成为具有共产主义思想的民族干部了。
    过去凉山彝族社会中，没有城市，没有集镇，没有自己的民族市场和专业商人。商品交换主要发生在彝汉两族之间，而这种交易又是极不合理的。几个蛋只能换一根针，五、六十斤粮食才能换一斤盐。所以，那时彝族人民普遍买不起盐巴，许多人一辈子没有穿过一件布衣服。现在，全区已经建立了六十六个民族贸易机构。据统计，仅1956年1月至10月，就供应人民铁木农具、用具四十八万多件，供应的盐、酒、油价值达一千四百九十四万元。随着工业品的减价和土特产品收购价格的提高，交换比价有了巨大的变化。再加以实行了民主改革，人民购买力有了显著的增长，如以1955年和1956年的实销货相比，全区平均每人一年所用宽布，已由五尺四寸四增至十七尺一寸；土布由十三尺八寸五增至二十二尺六寸八；盐巴则由三斤五两增至四斤三两多（包括牲畜用盐）。这些数字，生动地显示了人民生活改善的情况。
    彝族原来有一种音缀文字（老彝文），但因字数少，变体多，除少数“毕摩”巫师识用外，人民一般都不识字。现在在中国科学院帮助下，创造了彝族自己的拼音新文字。这种新文字由于容易学习掌握，已有八、九千人学会了，这是彝族历史上的一件大喜事。
    文化教育事业也获得了发展。根据十二个县的统计，解放前全区只有一所小学，如今则有小学一百一十二所、学生一万四千多人，此外尚有民族速成师范学校二所。从前，人民靠巫师咒鬼、杀鸡宰羊来治病；现在，许多县都设立了卫生医疗机构，免费给人民治病。
    交通一向很不方便的凉山，解放前，许多地方连羊肠小道都没有，外出行走，一不小心就会掉下悬崖。如今县、区、乡之间，都普遍修筑了宽大的驿道和便道。最令人兴奋的是，横贯大小凉山腹心地带的宜西公路全线通车了，沿着这条幸福的大道，源源运来各种生产和生活资料。
    “可是，彝族人民最大的变化，还在于实行了民主改革。”瓦渣木基州长继续说道：“经过1956年翻天复地的社会改革，六十多万奴隶和劳动者，当家作主了。他们在取得土地和获得人身自由以后，组织了合作社和互助组，跳越过封建社会、资本主义社会的历史阶段，欢天喜地地走上了社会主义的大道。”
    〔注一〕“家支”，凉山彝族中，以父系血缘形成的、同一祖先的“家”中，又分成为许多支头，如罗洪家、阿候家、八且家等，每家都有自己的地域和势力范围。
    〔注二〕“查尔瓦”是彝族类似“披风”的一种服装，用羊毛捻线编织而成，耐寒，避风，不透雨。
    〔注三〕“天菩萨”是彝族男子头顶上留的一撮头发，认为是神灵的所在地方，外人不能乱摸。
    〔注四〕“曲诺”是彝族社会中的一个阶层，他们依靠自己劳动，占有一定的生产资料，并有较大的人身自由，衣食大体可自足，民主改革中统称他们为劳动者。（附图片）
    凉山昭觉团结农业社社员依可母过去一家都给奴隶主当奴隶，民主改革后全家母子团圆了，孩子们也上了小学。这是他们全家的合影。
    这是解放后的昭觉新建的人民路，大街两旁新建了很多楼房，形成一个新的城市。
