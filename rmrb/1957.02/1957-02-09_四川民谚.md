    Sichuan Proverbs
    A girl fears missing her future husband; crops fear missing the right season.
    A scholar is not afraid of tattered blue robes, only of having nothing in his belly (lacking knowledge).
    If a lamp is dim, someone will adjust it; if things are unfair, someone will speak out.
    Even rapid currents have returning waves.
     A single piece of firewood is hard to burn; a single child is hard to teach.
    A dull knife is sharpened on a stone; a clumsy person learns from others.
     A knife will rust if not sharpened; a person will fall behind if they don't study.
    Diligent and careful, clothes are neat; lazy and idle,
    suffering from hunger.
                      (Compiled by Li)

    四川民谚
    姑娘怕误女婿、庄稼怕误节气。
    秀才不怕蓝衫破，只怕肚子没得货。
    灯盏不明有人拨，事情不平有人说。
    急水也有回头浪。
     独柴难烧，独儿难教。
    刀钝石上磨，人笨人前学。
     刀儿不磨要生锈，人不学习要落后。
    勤勤谨谨，衣衫齐整；懒懒惰惰，
    挨饥受饿。
                      （犁　辑）
