    Rongrong and Maomao
    Tang Chang
    In the workers' dormitory, the two children who impressed me most were Rongrong and Maomao. They both had big eyes and black eyebrows, and their faces were rosy and fair. When they chased and played on the lawn in the courtyard, they looked like two little white rabbits tumbling carefree in the green grass, full of vitality and giving people the greatest joy.
    Anyone who has not been close to children can hardly say how lovable they are. On the afternoon I moved into the dormitory, after making my bed, I was cleaning the room when suddenly a girl flashed past the door, with another boy limping behind her, constantly calling, "Sister Rongrong! Sister Rongrong!" I turned around, and the boy happened to run to my door, holding a small red ball in his hand, barefoot. He noticed me, a stranger, and stopped, staring at me with his big, bright eyes. The girl who had run past earlier also hesitantly walked over, gave me a contemptuous look, and then reached out to pull her companion: "Maomao, let's go!" Maomao was so attracted by the shiny black bird gun on the wall inside the house that he simply sat down on the threshold.
    I patted Maomao's rosy face and asked him:
    "What's your surname?"
    "Gao."
    "What about you?" I asked the girl.
    "Mind your own business."
    She turned and ran away, the red silk butterfly tied to her braid flashing, as if it were about to fly.
    I couldn't help but smile.
    As time went on, Rongrong and Maomao became familiar with me, and I learned that they were not siblings. Maomao was the second son of Gao Shaocheng, a handyman, and Rongrong was the eldest daughter of Director Fang of the office. She was almost six years old this year, but Maomao was several months younger than her.
    One morning, I had just washed my face when I heard Rongrong and Maomao's voices in the courtyard, sometimes sounding like crying and scolding, and sometimes like laughing. I found it strange, so I opened the window, and a fragrance of flowers drifted in with the wind. The two children were circling under several blossoming wintersweet trees. Maomao was straddling a section of green bamboo, "dudu-ing" in his mouth, running forward, looking like a little hero riding a steed, valiantly charging forward in the cold December wind. Rongrong, swaying her body, which was bulky wrapped in a cotton coat, chased after him, shouting, "Let me ride! Let me ride!" almost crying.
    "Stop!" Suddenly a female comrade darted out from the corner.
    Maomao was stunned and didn't have time to dodge; the bamboo in his hand was suddenly taken away by the other party. He was in high spirits, and this sudden attack made him cry "wah!".
    "Rongrong, you ride!"
    The female comrade turned around and handed the bamboo pole to Rongrong. Only then did I see that she was a clerk from the office. She ignored Maomao and bent down to kiss Rongrong's little cheek. While comforting Rongrong, she said, "He bullied you? Don't play with dirty, slovenly bad kids! Let him cry."
    "Bang!" A piece of tile hit the clerk's back. "You little hooligan, watch me chop off your hands!" She was aggressive, clenched her fists, and pouted. Then she shouted loudly, "Sister Gao! Look, Gao Wa is hitting people again!"
    When Sister Gao appeared in the courtyard, she was holding a feather duster upside down, standing under the eaves, pointing at Maomao and shouting, "Are you coming over here! If you dare to run, I'll settle the score with you tonight!"
    Maomao had already geared up to run away, but after hearing his mother's warning, he hesitated thoughtfully, probably because he had tasted the meaning of "settling the score". Sister Gao walked up to Maomao in a few strides, grabbed him, and dragged him into the house. Maomao involuntarily, trudging along, staggered and was dragged into the house.
    "Straighten up a bit, too outrageous!"
    The clerk muttered, her anger still simmering. Afterward, she glanced at Rongrong. Rongrong didn't look up, but squinted her eyes, a look of regret on her face. Although she held the bamboo section in her hand, she didn't seem to want to ride it now. The clerk smiled softly and said, "Come on! Let's go to your dad's place."
    "I'm not going!" Rongrong hurriedly retracted her little hand that the clerk was holding, rolled her eyes. This was really beyond the clerk's expectations. …
    On the way to the office, I felt very uncomfortable, whether it was because of the clerk's discriminatory attitude towards the children or something else.

    溶溶和毛毛
    唐昌
    职工宿舍里给我印象最深的是溶溶和毛毛这两个孩子。他们都是大眼睛黑眉毛，脸蛋呈现出白里透红的颜色。他们在院落里草地上追赶玩耍的时候，叫人觉得是两只小白兔在碧绿的草里无忧无虑地打滚，处处都充满了生气，给人一种最大的欢喜。
    谁要是没有接近过孩子，谁就很难说出孩子们是怎样的逗人爱。我刚搬进宿舍的那天下午，把床铺整理好后，正在打扫屋子，忽然房门口一闪，跑过了一个女孩子，另一个男孩子一拐一拐在后追赶着，不住地叫唤：“溶姐姐！溶姐姐！”我转过身去，男孩子刚好跑到我的门口，手里拿着小红皮球，光脚板。他发现我这个陌生人，便停了下来，尽睁着黑溜溜一双大眼睛望我。先前跑过去的女孩子这时也趑趄地走过来了，她用轻蔑的眼光把我盯一下，便伸手去拉她的同伴：“毛毛，走！”毛毛因为屋内壁上那支黑得发亮的鸟枪吸引住他，索性在门槛上坐下来了。
    我顺手摸摸毛毛红润的脸蛋，问他：
    “你姓什么？”
  　“姓高。”
    “你呢？”我又向着女孩子问。
    “管人家呢。”
    她一扭身便跑了，辫子上系的红绸蝴蝶，一闪一闪地，活像要飞了一样。
    我禁不住笑了。
    时间一长，溶溶和毛毛都跟我混熟了，知道他们并不是姐弟。毛毛是杂工高绍成的第二个儿子，溶溶是办公室方主任的大女儿，今年快要六岁了，毛毛却小她好几个月。
    一天早晨，我刚洗过脸。听见院落里溶溶和毛毛的声音，一会儿像是在哭骂，一会儿又像在欢笑。我觉得很奇怪，推开窗户，随风飘来一股花香。那两个孩子正在几株盛开的腊梅树下兜圈子。毛毛跨着一节碧绿的斑竹，嘴里不住“嘟嘟嘟”地，纵身向前奔跑，活像一个小英雄骑在一匹骏马上，雄赳赳地，在十二月的寒风里一直向前冲去。溶溶摆动着为棉衣包裹的笨重的身子，一边追赶，一边喊叫：“我骑一下嘛！我骑一下嘛！”急得几乎哭了出来。
    “站住！”忽然从拐角处闪出一个女同志。
    毛毛一怔，还来不及躲避，手中的斑竹骤然间被对方夺去了。他兴致正浓，遭到这突如其来的袭击，“哇”地一声哭了起来了。
    “溶溶你来骑！”
    那个女同志转身把竹杆递给溶溶。我才看清她是办公室的干事。她并不理睬毛毛，弯下腰亲着溶溶的小腮帮子。一面安慰溶溶，“他欺负你啦？不要同肮脏邋遢的坏娃娃耍！让他哭去。”
    “啪！”一块瓦片恰打中干事的背脊。“你这个小流氓，看我把手给你砍了！”她气势汹汹地，握紧拳头，嘟呶着嘴。随即高声武气地喊：“高大嫂！你看高娃又在打人哩！”
    高大嫂出现在院坝时，倒握着鸡毛帚，站在屋檐下，指着毛毛叫：“你过不过来！敢跑，晚上给你算总账！”
    毛毛本来架起势要逃跑的，听了妈妈的警告，若有所思地迟疑着，大概他尝过算总账的味儿。高大嫂三脚两步地走到毛毛面前，一把抓着毛毛，就往屋内拖。毛毛不由自主地，磨磨蹭蹭跨着步子，踉踉跄跄地被拉进屋去。
    “好生收拾下子，太不成名堂了！”
    干事余怒未息地嘟囔着，过后她瞅一眼溶溶。溶溶可没抬起头来，也斜着眼，脸上挂着懊悔的神气，手内虽然拿着那节斑竹，现在并没有想骑它的意思。干事轻轻笑着说：“来！到你爸爸那儿去。”
    “不去！”溶溶赶忙缩回被干事握着的小手，翻了一下白眼。这真出乎干事的意料。…………
    在去办公室的路上，不知是因为干事那种分别对待孩子们的态度呢，还是因为别的什么，我觉得很不舒服。
