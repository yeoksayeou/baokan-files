The Performance of Yuan Dynasty Ancient Music

At the recent Yunnan Provincial Amateur Song, Dance and Opera Festival, eight Naxi amateur actors from the foot of Jade Dragon Snow Mountain used instruments such as the *hunbushi*, grass flute, and *pipa* to perform three ancient Yuan Dynasty melodies. The melancholic and somber tunes slowly narrated the sorrow and reluctance of loved ones facing separation. Long after the music ended, the profound sounds seemed to still echo in the room.

The ability of Naxi amateur actors to perform Yuan Dynasty ancient music has a historical story behind it. According to legend, more than six hundred years ago, when Kublai Khan, the Yuan Dynasty Emperor Shizu, went south to Yunnan, he was warmly received by Mu Tianwang, the Naxi chieftain. To thank him for his hospitality, Kublai Khan, before departing, left behind half a team of musicians and half a music score as a gift. The Naxi people inherited the music of the Mongolian band and also retained the Mongolian attire of the musicians at the time, including the turban and long robes. The remaining music is collectively called "Farewell Gifts." Because this set of music expresses people's sorrowful emotions, later, whenever the Naxi people commemorated the deceased, they played it as a dirge.

Over hundreds of years, most of the original music has been lost. Only the Naxi farmer, He Xidi, who participated in this performance, still remembers five pieces. (Xinhua News Agency)

    元代古曲的演奏
    在最近举行的云南省业余歌舞戏曲会演大会上，来自玉龙山麓的八个纳西族业余演员用浑不似、草笛、琵琶等乐器演奏了三首元代古曲。忧郁而又低沉的曲调，慢慢地在叙说着亲人将离别时的惆怅和难舍的心情。曲终多时，深沉的声音仿佛还在室内回荡。
    纳西族业余演员能演奏元代古曲，是有一段历史故事的。相传六百多年前，元世祖忽必烈南下入滇，路经现今丽江地区的时候，曾经受到纳西族土司木天王的热情接待。忽必烈为答谢他的盛意，临去时留下了半队乐工和一半乐谱作为赠礼。纳西族承继了蒙古乐队的乐曲，同时也保留了当年乐工们的打包头、穿长袍的蒙古装束。所遗留的乐曲总称“别时谢礼”。由于这组乐曲表达人们哀痛的情绪，后来纳西人每逢纪念亡人，就把它当作哀乐来演奏。
    经过几百年的时间，当初的乐曲大都已经散失，唯有参加这次会演的纳西族农民和锡迪还记得五首。　　（新华社）
