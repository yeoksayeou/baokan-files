Sino-Soviet Heilongjiang Survey
    Team Advances to the Second Dam Site
    According to Heilongjiang Daily: After launching on-ice survey work at the Galinda dam site of the first hydroelectric power station on the upper reaches of the Heilongjiang River, members of the Sino-Soviet Heilongjiang Survey Team have begun advancing to the second dam site, the "Amazar" dam site. Preparations for the survey of this dam site are being stepped up.
      On the morning of January 16, Sino-Soviet survey team members, riding in Soviet open-top trucks, set off from Galinda for Amazar. The trucks sped along the snowy ice road, with snow-covered mountains on both sides flashing rapidly by, and the cold wind of the river valley buffeting their faces. Even the thick fur coats they wore were penetrated by the wind. Chinese survey team members, who were working in the north for the first time, said with a laugh: "If we keep training like this, we will become steel!" The steamed buns they brought had frozen into hard lumps. Without fire to toast them, they nibbled them layer by layer, taking half an hour to eat three buns. After a long journey of 170 kilometers, the trucks arrived in Amazar at 11 p.m. that night.
    The next day, Chinese and Soviet survey team members, without even taking a rest, began fieldwork at the Amazar dam site. Mao Yuqing, the Chinese survey team leader, and Elena, a Soviet female geological engineer, together measured the positions of six riverbed boreholes on the snow-covered river surface. Soon, six core drilling rigs will be erected there.
    Amazar is located 35 kilometers upstream from Mohe. With its high mountains and narrow river valley on both banks, it is a regulatory hydroelectric power station in the Heilongjiang hidden-level development plan, with a dam height of 120 meters and an installed capacity of 1.2 million kilowatts. The amount of on-ice survey work at this dam site is much greater than that at the Galinda dam site.
    Currently, preparations for the survey of the Amazar dam site are being stepped up. The Soviet geological team has arrived in Amazar, and several trucks are transporting equipment to the drilling site day after day, and one hand-cranked drill has begun working. The Chinese geological team also departed from Galinda for Amazar on the 12th, and a large amount of drilling equipment is about to be shipped.

### 冲破冰雪封锁进行勘测中苏黑龙江勘测  总队向第二个坝段进军

    冲破冰雪封锁进行勘测中苏黑龙江勘测
    总队向第二个坝段进军
    据黑龙江日报讯　在黑龙江上游第一期水电站加林达坝段展开冰上勘测工作之后，中苏黑龙江勘测总队的队员们又开始向第二个坝段阿玛扎尔”坝段进军。这个坝段的勘测前的准备工作正在加紧进行。
      1月16日早晨，中苏勘测队员乘着苏联的敞篷卡车从加林达驶向阿玛扎尔。汽车奔驰在积雪的冰道上，两岸雪封的山岭，迅速向后闪去，河谷的寒风迎面扑来，身上穿的厚敦敦的皮大衣也吹透了。第一次来北方工作的中国勘测队员反笑着说：“这样锻炼下去，人就变成钢铁的了。”他们带的馒头冻成了硬块，没有火来烤，就一层一层地啃，三个馒头吃了半点钟。汽车经过一百七十公里的长途旅行，在当天深夜十一时到达了阿玛扎尔。
    第二天，中苏两国勘测队员也未及休息，就在阿玛扎尔坝段上开始了野外工作。中国测量队长茅玉清和苏联女地质工程师叶列娜一起在白雪皑皑的江面上测定了六个河床钻孔的位置。不久，那里就将竖起六部岩心钻机。
    阿玛扎尔在漠河上游三十五公里处，两岸山岭高峻，河谷狭仄，是黑龙江隐级开发方案中的调节性水电站，坝高一百二十公尺，装机容量一百二十万瓩。这个坝段的冰上勘测工作量大大超过加林达坝段。
    现在，阿玛扎尔坝段的勘测准备工作正加紧进行。苏联地质队已到达阿玛扎尔，几辆汽车正连日往钻场运送器材，并有一台手摇钻开始工作。中国地质队12日也从加林达出发赶往阿玛扎尔，大批的钻探器材也即将启运。
