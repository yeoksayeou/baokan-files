The Guangzhou Cultural Park held a Lantern Festival, collecting various lanterns that have been circulating in Guangdong folk for many years for people to enjoy.

On the night of the Lantern Festival, the reporter followed the crowd into the lantern show, and saw more than 500 colorful lanterns of various sizes hanging in the center of a tree-lined avenue from west to east. People came and went in groups.

At the center of the lantern show, under a tall colored archway, the Thousand-Angle Lantern from Dongguan County was on display. This lantern is more than ten feet high and wide, and the body of the lantern is entirely carved with openwork patterns, with exquisite and ingenious composition of one thousand and fifty-six angles. More than four hundred and fifty lamp holders surround the entire lamp. From a distance, the lights glitter, like twinkling stars in the night sky. Eight silver single-tailed dragons extend from the lamp cover, hanging twenty-four bright and pleasing lamp ribbons. The audience all praised its exquisite craftsmanship.

A fellow villager from Dongguan was telling the audience around him about the origin of this Thousand-Angle Lantern: It originated in the Song Dynasty, and the twenty-four lamp ribbons hanging on the lantern are said to have been collected by Emperor Zhenzong of Song more than seven hundred years ago from folk artists to make. There are one hundred and thirty-six historical stories, figures, and flowers from before the Song Dynasty carved and painted on the lamp ribbons. These pictures are painted with amber, cinnabar, agate, etc. Under the light, the characters are lifelike. The Zhao clan in Dongguan County retained this custom until the Anti-Japanese War: every five years, they made a Thousand-Angle Lantern and hung this set of lamp ribbons to celebrate the Lantern Festival.

Looking left and right away from the Thousand-Angle Lantern, there are large palace lanterns, revolving lanterns, dragon lanterns, fish lanterns, bird lanterns, and beast lanterns of different styles. The most eye-catching are the three figure lantern screens in Chaozhou. One is a scene composed of six figures of Hua Mulan joining the army for twelve years and defeating the foreign invaders. The other two are local Chaozhou opera "Searching the Building" and "Drunken Concubine." These wonderful works were led and produced by Lin Lesheng, an old artist in Chaozhou in his seventies. Twenty years ago, the figure lantern screens he made were exhibited in London and received good reviews. Since then, he has never made such large lantern screens again.

On the other side of the Chaozhou lantern screen, a group of people were carefully scrutinizing it. Here is a lantern screen made of "Fisherman, Woodcutter, Farmer, Scholar" and next to it is a four or five-foot-long dragon boat racing lantern screen. Five-colored umbrellas and colorful flags flutter on the dragon boat, and forty burly men wield paddles, vigorously piercing through the turbulent white waves and moving forward.

Children like the bird, beast and fish lanterns the most. The ingenious owner decorated the exhibition place into the appearance of deep mountains, jungles and crystal palaces. The bird, beast and fish lanterns are cleverly hung in them, respectively forming scenes of flying birds and beasts and swimming fish in the water. (Attached picture)

The lanterns in Fuzhou are exquisitely made and are very popular among citizens. During the Spring Festival, the city held its annual lantern exhibition as usual, exhibiting more abundant and colorful lanterns than in previous years.

    元宵之夜观花灯
    新华社记者　晓兰　陈日晶
    广州文化公园举办一个元宵灯会，搜集了广东民间流传多年的各式花灯供人观赏。
    元宵节之夜，记者随着人流涌进灯会，只见从西到东一条林荫大道的中央，挂满大小五百多盏五光十色的花灯。人们成群结队，涌来涌去。
    在灯会的中心，一个高大的彩牌楼下，展出了来自东莞县的千角灯。这座灯高阔都有一丈多，灯身全部挑通花纹，八面玲珑，巧妙地组成一千零五十六个角。四百五十多个灯座围绕全灯，远远望去灯光闪闪，宛如夜空中的点点繁星。灯盖上伸出八条银色的单尾龙，高悬着二十四条鲜艳悦目的灯带。观众无不称赞它制作精巧。
    一个从东莞来的老乡，在向他周围的观众讲述这种千角灯的来历：它起源于宋朝，灯上挂的那二十四条灯带，据说还是七百多年前宋真宗征集当时民间艺人制作的。灯带上雕画有一百三十六幅宋代以前的历史故事、人物和花卉。这些图画用琥珀、朱砂、玛瑙等画成，在灯光下，人物栩栩如生。东莞县的赵族，直到抗日战争前还保留着这样的风俗：每隔五年制作一个千角灯，挂上这套灯带以庆元宵。
    离开千角灯往左右看，挂的都是不同风格的大宫灯、走马灯、走龙灯、鱼灯、鸟灯、兽灯等。最惹人注目的是潮州的三座人物灯屏。有一座是由六个人物组成的花木兰从军十二载，大败番邦的一个场面。另两座扎的是潮州地方戏“搜楼”和贵妃醉酒。这几个精彩的作品是潮州七十多岁老艺人林乐笙领导制作的。二十年前他扎的人物灯屏在伦敦展出的时候曾获得过好评。此后他再没有扎过这样大的灯屏。
    在潮州灯屏的另一侧，有一群人在那里仔细端详。这里有一座“渔、樵、耕、读图”扎成的灯屏，旁边还摆着一座四五尺长的划龙舟的灯屏。龙舟上飘扬着五色的罗伞和彩旗，还有四十名彪形大汉挥着桨，用劲戳破滔滔白浪往前挺进。
    小孩子最喜欢的还是那些鸟兽鱼灯。独具匠心的主人把展览的地方布置成深山丛林和水晶宫的模样，鸟兽鱼灯巧妙地挂在其中，分别构成飞禽走兽和水中游鱼的景象。（附图片）
    福州市的花灯制作得玲珑精巧，很受市民的欢迎。在春节期间，市内照例举行了一年一度的花灯展览会，展出了比往年更丰富多彩的花灯。　　　　　　　　　　叶大开摄（新华社稿）
