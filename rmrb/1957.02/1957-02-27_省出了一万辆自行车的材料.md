Xinhua News Agency Dispatch:

    Workers at the Tianjin Bicycle Factory, starting from small savings like a few cents of steel and a few liang of iron, proposed 309 conservation measures. In steel alone, more than 250 tons can be saved. It is estimated that all the raw materials saved can produce more than 10,000 bicycles.

    In the movement to increase production and practice economy, the factory's workers started from the smallest things to find ways to save. Technicians reviewed the technological designs of the bicycle's 213 parts one by one. The spoke nipple is a copper part weighing only 0.0016 kilograms, but the technicians in the technological design section did not let it go. They changed the convex spoke nipple to a concave one, saving 0.7 grams of copper from each spoke nipple, which could save about 1,000 jin of brass for the whole year. The workers in the punch die section of the second workshop changed the five square holes in the bicycle wheel disc to five round holes, and then used the chunks of round steel plates, weighing more than four liang each, punched out from the five round holes to re-punch the central axle cups, which could save more than 40 tons of steel annually.

    The various semi-finished products pressed by the press material section of the first workshop all had a provision for an addition and subtraction tolerance of five to ten si. Veteran worker Li Yuhe, section chief Li Chunlin, and others found a way to press various semi-finished products according to the reduction tolerance within this tolerance of less than two newspaper thicknesses. At that time, some people said that saving three or five si was less than a strand of hair, so what was the point? However, after the workshop's Party branch organized the workers to perform a demonstration, it proved that this item alone could save 69 tons of steel annually.

    省出了一万辆自行车的材料
    据新华社讯　天津自行车厂职工从几分钢、几两铁等点滴着手提出三百零九项节约措施，仅钢材一项，就能节省二百五十多吨。估计节约的全部原材料能生产一万多辆自行车。
    增产节约运动中，这个工厂的职工从一点一滴着手寻找节约途径。技术人员对自行车的二百一十三个零件的工艺设计，逐个地做了审查。车条母是一个只有零点零零一六公斤重的铜制零件，但是工艺设计科的技术人员并没有把它放过。他们把凸头的车条母改成凹头，从每个车条母上节约了零点七克铜，全年约能节省黄铜一千斤。第二车间冲模工段的工人们把自行车轮盘中的五个方孔改成五个圆孔，再利用五个圆孔中冲下来的四两多重的一块块圆钢板，改冲中轴碗，每年就能节省四十多吨钢材。
    第一车间压材工段压制的各种半成品，都有一个五丝到十丝的加减公差的规定。老工人李玉和，工段长李春林等人，就在这种还不到两张报纸厚的公差中找到了按照减公差压制各种半成品的办法。当时曾经有人说，节省个三丝五丝，还没有一根头发多，有啥名堂。但是经过车间的党支部组织工人进行表演以后证明，仅这一项，全年就能节省钢材六十九吨。
