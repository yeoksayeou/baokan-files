To a Person Who Likes to Jump to "Conclusions"
      Zhang Zhimin
    You say: People who don't like to sing
  Must have bad voices; you say: People with stuffy noses
  Must have caught a cold; you say: Those who shed tears are definitely not heroes, you say: A girl's silence
  Means she's announcing "rejection" to you... Comrade, you are often wrong, fortunately, you are not a surgeon, otherwise, how many people would suffer from unnecessary operations.

    给一个好下“结论”的人
      张志民
    你说：不爱唱歌的人
  定是嗓子不好；你说：鼻子不通的人
  定是害了感冒；你说：流泪的定不是英雄，你说：姑娘表示沉默
  就是向你宣布“拒绝”了……同志，你常常是错了，幸而，你不是个外科医生，否则，有多少人会挨过冤枉刀。
