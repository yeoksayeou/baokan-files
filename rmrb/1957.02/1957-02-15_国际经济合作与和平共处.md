International Economic Cooperation and Peaceful Coexistence
Ji Chaoding

More than two months ago, Soviet representative Shepilov proposed at the UN General Assembly to hold a world economic conference in 1957 to discuss issues related to the development of international economic cooperation on a world scale; in mid-January this year, at the Economic and Financial Committee of the UN General Assembly, Soviet representative Chernyshev emphasized again the necessity of convening a world economic conference. This is another effort by the Soviet Union to ease international tensions and promote the realization of the principle of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems.

The Soviet proposal stated that this world economic conference should discuss three main issues: (1) Further development of world trade and the establishment of a world trade organization within the framework of the United Nations; (2) Implementation of international economic cooperation to help underdeveloped countries establish independent national economies; (3) Issues related to international credit and finance. From the content of this proposed agenda, it can be seen that this will be a conference to discuss active economic cooperation on a broad world scale. Therefore, the Soviet proposal specifically pointed out: "All countries should be invited to participate, regardless of whether they are members of the United Nations." The Soviet Union first emphasized this point, which has its important significance. At present, the legitimate seat of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations has not yet been restored, and some countries in the world, such as the Mongolian People's Republic, are still excluded from the United Nations. If a world-scale conference is to be convened and problems are truly to be solved, it is unreasonable and impossible without the participation of these countries.

After World War II, with the formation, expansion, and consolidation of the peaceful, democratic, and socialist camp, as well as the establishment and growth of nationally independent neutral countries, considerable experience has been accumulated and significant achievements have been made in equal and mutually beneficial international economic cooperation. First of all, the socialist camp, which has one-third of the world's population and 30% of the world's total industrial output value, has established international economic cooperation relations based on equality, mutual benefit, and fraternal mutual assistance to promote the common economic upsurge of various countries.

In the process of development, some mistakes violating the principle of equality have occurred in the relations between certain socialist countries. However, the Soviet government's declaration of October 30 last year on the basis of developing and further strengthening the friendship and cooperation between the Soviet Union and other socialist countries has firmly declared its determination to correct these mistakes; on November 1 of the same year, the Chinese government also issued a statement supporting the Soviet declaration. The successful results of a series of talks between fraternal countries, such as the Soviet-Polish talks in November last year, the Soviet-Romanian talks in December, the five-nation representative talks between Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, the Soviet Union, and Czechoslovakia in early January this year, and the Sino-Soviet talks in the second half of January, fully prove that the Soviet government's declaration of October 30 last year is being earnestly implemented in practice. These facts further clarify that the socialist system itself does not carry any aggression, and the mutual relations between socialist countries are firmly established on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. In the economic field, this relationship is specifically manifested in equal and mutually beneficial trade exchanges and completely selfless and unconditional economic assistance.

This kind of equal, mutually beneficial, and fraternal international relationship is a product of the socialist system and a characteristic of the socialist political and economic system. Before the emergence of the socialist system, there were only relations of mutual contention and competition between capitalist countries and oppression and aggression against colonies. After the October Revolution, especially after World War II, there was the possibility of truly establishing international relations based on peaceful coexistence, equality, mutual benefit, and friendly cooperation. However, since this kind of relationship has emerged, its influence is not limited to socialist countries. The superiority of this relationship and the benefits to the broad masses of people are obvious.

Especially for colonial peoples and peoples who have newly turned over from colonial rule and achieved national independence, who have suffered deeply from imperialist oppression and exploitation, the attracting power of this equal and mutually beneficial relationship is very great. Therefore, in recent years, the scope of implementation of this relationship has far exceeded the scope of the socialist camp and included nationally independent countries. Therefore, the Asian-African Conference unanimously adopted a resolution on economic cooperation based on the Five Principles. In the year and more since the end of the conference, socialist countries such as the Soviet Union, China, and Czechoslovakia have signed many trade protocols and payment agreements with countries such as India, Indonesia, Ceylon, Egypt, and Cambodia, as well as people's organizations in Japan, on the principle of equality and mutual benefit. It can be seen that the circle of international economic cooperation based on the Five Principles is getting bigger and bigger. This is a manifestation of the will of the growing number of people who demand peace, oppose hot wars, and oppose cold wars. This is a force that cannot be ignored in today's international affairs!

This situation proves that the international economic policy of socialist countries, on the one hand, is not closed-door and self-sufficient; at the same time, it is not expansionist and aggressive in order to infringe upon the rights and interests of other countries and seize international markets. Socialist countries advocate developing foreign trade in order to exchange materials with other countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, according to the needs and possibilities of both parties. That is to say, unlike the United States, which uses American "aid" as a condition to obtain patent acquisitions of certain strategic raw materials and other various privileges in the "aided" countries; nor does it stir up trouble in the international major raw material markets like the United States, deliberately lowering raw material prices in order to cheaply obtain raw material supplies and reserves. On the export side, there has also been no case like the United States, which uses political and economic pressure to force some countries that do not need to import certain agricultural products to import surplus American agricultural products under unreasonable conditions.

Socialist countries produce not to pursue profits, but to meet the needs of domestic economic construction and improve the daily economic and cultural requirements of the people. The socialist domestic market is constantly expanding with the increase in production and the improvement of people's lives. Therefore, the purpose of socialist countries' exports is not to compete for markets and pursue profits, but to exchange for imported materials needed to meet domestic economic construction and people's lives, and, when necessary, to take out some materials to help friendly countries, especially to help the industrialization needs of underdeveloped countries. It can be seen that the basic nature of the socialist economic system gives the socialist countries' trade development policy a meaning that is fundamentally different from the trade expansion attempts of capitalist countries. Since the purpose of socialist countries' exports is not to compete for markets or pursue profits, its nature is not exclusive, nor does it only take care of its own partial interests, so it can earnestly implement a foreign trade policy of equality and mutual benefit.

In other words, our purpose in doing foreign trade is not to take advantage of others, making us rich and others poor, but to make both parties benefit from trade, so that both parties are richer than before because of this transaction; this is called "equality and mutual benefit, common improvement." The essence of this kind of trade is equivalent exchange, taking into account the interests of both the buyer and the seller, so it can promote international peaceful coexistence and friendly cooperation.

It can be seen that the Soviet Union's proposal at the United Nations to convene a world economic conference obviously takes into account the interests of all countries in the world. As early as April 1952, when the imperialist war of aggression against Korea was still in progress and the "embargo" policy was rampant, the Soviet Union and some people from all over the world convened an international economic conference in Moscow. Four hundred and seventy-one business people, economists, trade union workers, and cooperative workers from forty-nine countries unanimously advocated eliminating artificial obstacles and developing trade between countries to improve the living standards of people in various countries. Facts in the years after the meeting have proved that the impact of this meeting was quite significant. During the meeting, trade circles in the East and the West signed many private trade agreements. The trade relations established thereby have continued to develop in many ways in the years after the meeting. This meeting began to reverse a kind of cold war atmosphere created in international trade, especially in East-West trade, due to measures such as "embargoes."

Unreasonable "embargo" measures did not hinder the rapid economic development of socialist countries, but caused no small damage to the countries implementing this policy. This fact has been seen more and more clearly by people of all countries in recent years. Except for some stubborn elements in the United States, public opinion circles in Western countries, and even some officials, have clearly stated that developing trade between Eastern and Western countries is beneficial to everyone. Although the "embargo" policy has been abandoned by the world and has been forced to relax in many ways, the US ruling clique still insists on promoting this policy. Recently, the United States has suggested convening a high-level policy meeting of the 14-nation Coordinating Committee in Paris in order to exert pressure on other countries to intensify the implementation of the "embargo." Therefore, the Soviet representative said in his speech at the United Nations Economic and Financial Committee in January: "The Soviet Union believes that solving the problems hindering the development of foreign trade is of great significance." He also specifically stated that "in order to find ways and methods for formulating fair prices for industrial products and raw materials under the principle of being conducive to the balance of foreign trade payments, and in order to do everything possible to eliminate various artificial obstacles and restrictions to the free exchange of material wealth in order to improve people's living standards, the Soviet delegation believes that it is necessary to establish a corresponding international organization within the United Nations." Obviously, this Soviet proposal is in line with the objective requirements of the development of the international situation.

Regarding the issue of helping underdeveloped countries establish independent national economies, the development of the objective situation also requires relevant countries to jointly discuss in order to seek solutions through international economic cooperation. Because the situation of this issue is that on the one hand, the call of underdeveloped countries for industrialization and the establishment of independent national economies is getting higher and higher, and on the other hand, the aggressive nature of the so-called "aid" given by imperialist countries has gradually been recognized by the governments and people of underdeveloped countries. Quite a few countries have openly rejected this kind of "aid" with conditions that infringe upon their national independence, sovereignty, and interests. In January this year, the representatives of underdeveloped countries at the United Nations Economic and Financial Committee have put forward the opinion that aid should be given by international organizations rather than by individual countries. Therefore, the question of how to truly give the assistance needed by these countries has become an important topic in current international affairs. It is timely and appropriate for the Soviet Union to propose discussing this issue at the World Economic Conference at this time.

In any case, the Soviet Union's proposal to convene a world economic conference is reasonable, impartial, and in line with the interests and demands of the majority of people in the world. This is a timely cooling agent for the imperialists' frenzy to restore the Cold War in recent months. As Foreign Minister Shepilov said at the UN General Assembly, "The slogan of the Atlantic Group is 'Let us arm ourselves!' Our slogan is 'Let us trade!'" We believe that as the international situation continues to ease and world public opinion increasingly dislikes the Cold War, no matter whether the few imperialist countries that are still holding the United Nations and the countries that are forced to follow them will accept this proposal, such a positive proposal related to world peace and the vital interests of all countries should be supported and endorsed by the broad masses of people around the world.

    国际经济合作与和平共处
    冀朝鼎
    两个多月前，苏联代表谢皮洛夫在联合国大会全体会议上提出了在1957年举行世界经济会议以讨论有关发展世界规模的国际经济合作问题的建议；今年1月中旬，在联合国大会经济及财政委员会上，苏联代表切尔内晓夫又强调指出召开世界经济会议的必要。这是苏联对于缓和国际紧张局势及促进不同社会制度的国家间和平共处原则的实现的又一次努力。
    苏联的建议中说明，这个世界经济会议应该讨论三个主要问题：（一）进一步发展世界贸易，在联合国的范围内成立一个世界贸易组织；（二）实行国际经济合作来帮助不发达国家建立独立的民族经济；（三）有关国际信贷和金融的问题。由这个拟议的议程的内容可以看出，这将是一个讨论包括广大的世界规模的积极经济合作的会议。因此苏联建议中特别明确地指出：“应邀请一切国家参加，不问它们是否联合国会员国。”苏联首先强调这一点，是有它的重要意义的。现在中华人民共和国在联合国的合法席位还没有恢复，世界上还有一些国家，如蒙古人民共和国等还被排斥在联合国之外。如果要召集一个世界规模的会议，并且真正想解决问题，没有这些国家参加是不合理的，而且也是不成的。
    第二次世界大战以后，随着和平民主社会主义阵营的形成、扩大和巩固，以及民族独立的中立国家的建立和壮大，在平等互利的国际经济合作方面已经积累了不少经验，有了相当显著的成就。首先拥有全世界人口三分之一，并且拥有全世界工业总产值30％的社会主义阵营各国之间，已经在平等互利、兄弟般互助的基础上建立起国际经济合作的关系，以促进各国的共同经济高涨。
    在发展的过程中，某些社会主义国家的关系中间曾经发生过一些违反平等原则的错误。但是去年10月30日苏联政府关于发展和进一步加强苏联同其他社会主义国家的友谊和合作的基础的宣言，已坚决声明纠正这些错误的决心；同年11月1日中国政府亦发表了支持苏联这个宣言的声明。去年11月苏波会谈、12月苏罗会谈以及今年1月初保、匈、罗、苏、捷五国代表会谈、1月下半月的中苏会谈等一系列的兄弟国家间的会谈的完满结果，充分证明苏联政府去年10月30日的宣言正在认真地在实践中得到贯彻。这些事实更明确说明社会主义制度本身是不带任何侵略性的，社会主义各国之间的相互关系是稳固地建立在和平共处五项原则的基础上的。在经济方面，这种关系就具体表现在平等互利的贸易往来及完全无私的及不附带任何条件的经济援助等上面。
    这种平等互利的兄弟般互助的国际关系是社会主义制度的产物，是社会主义政治经济体系的特征。在社会主义制度出现以前，国际间只有资本主义国家间互相争夺、竞争以及对殖民地的压迫侵略关系。十月革命后，特别是第二次世界大战以后，才有了真正建立在和平共处、平等互利、友好互助的国际关系的可能。但是这种关系既然产生，它的影响便不止局限于社会主义国家之间了。这种关系的优越性、对广大人民的好处是很明显的。
    特别对身受帝国主义的压迫和剥削的殖民地人民以及新从殖民统治下翻身取得民族独立的人民，这种平等互利关系的吸引力量是很大的。因此近年来这种关系实现的范围便远超出社会主义阵营的范围，而包括了民族独立的国家。因此，亚非会议曾一致的通过以五项原则为基础的经济合作的决议案。而在会议结束后一年多以来，苏联、中国、捷克斯洛伐克等社会主义国家便在平等互利的原则上，和印度、印度尼西亚、锡兰、埃及、柬埔寨等国家以及日本的人民团体签订了不少的贸易议定书和支付协定。由此可见，以五项原则为基础的国际经济合作的圈子是愈来愈大了。这是愈来愈多的广大人民要求和平、反对热战以及冷战的意志的表现。这是当今国际事务中一种不可轻视的力量！
    这种情况证明社会主义国家的国际经济政策，一方面不是闭关自守，只谋自给自足；同时亦不是扩张侵略以谋侵害别国的利权，霸占国际市场。社会主义国家主张发展对外贸易，为的是与别国在平等互利的条件下，根据双方的需要与可能交换物资。这就是说，不像美国那样，以美“援”为条件取得在接受“援助”国家对于某些战略原料的专利收购以及其他各种特权；也不像美国那样在国际主要原料市场上兴风作浪，故意压低原料价格，以谋贱价取得原料供应及储备。在出口方面，也没有像美国那样，用政治及经济压力强迫一些不需要进口某些农产品的国家在不合理的条件下进口美国的剩余农产品。
    社会主义国家不是为了追求利润而是为了满足国内经济建设及提高人民日常经济及文化的要求而生产。社会主义的国内市场是随着生产的增加以及人民生活的提高而不断扩大的。因此，社会主义国家的出口的目的不是为了争夺市场、追求利润，而是用以交换为了满足国内经济建设及人民生活所需要的进口物资，以及有必要时拿出一些物资以帮助友好国家，特别是帮助未发达国家的工业化的需要。由此可见，社会主义经济制度的基本性质给予社会主义国家发展贸易的政策一个完全与资本主义国家的贸易扩张企图根本不同的意义。社会主义国家的出口的目的既然不是为了争夺市场，也不是为了追逐利润，它的性质便不是排他的，也不是只照顾片面的自己的利益的，因此它能够认真执行平等互利的对外贸易政策。
    换句话说，我们做对外贸易的目的，不是要占别人的便宜，使我们富别人穷，而是要使双方都得到贸易的好处，使双方都因为做了这笔生意而较前更富些；这就叫作“平等互利，共同提高”。这种贸易的本质是等价交换，照顾到买卖双方面的利益，因此它能促进国际间和平共处和友好合作的关系。
    由此可见，苏联在联合国提出召开世界经济会议的建议显然是照顾到世界各国的利益的。远在1952年4月，帝国主义侵朝战争还在进行，“禁运”政策正在猖狂的时候，苏联以及世界各国的一些人士曾在莫斯科召开了一个国际经济会议。来自四十九个国家的四百七十一位工商界人士、经济学家、工会工作者、合作社工作者，一致主张消除人为障碍、发展各国间的贸易往来以谋改善各国人民的生活水平。会后几年来的事实证明，这次会议的影响是相当大的。在会议期间东西各国的贸易界即签订了不少民间的贸易协定。由此建立起来的贸易关系，在会后几年内很多在继续发展。这样会议就开始扭转了由于“禁运”等措施在国际贸易中，特别东西方贸易中，所造成的一种冷战气氛。
    不合理的“禁运”措施并没有阻碍社会主义国家经济的迅速发展，反而为执行这种政策的国家造成了不小的损害。这种事实近年来已被各国人民看得愈来愈清楚了。除了美国一些顽固分子而外，西方各国的舆论界，甚至有些官方人士都明确表示发展东西各国间的贸易，是与大家都有利的事。虽然“禁运”政策已为世人所唾弃，且在很多方面已被迫放松了，但是美国统治集团仍然要坚持推行这种政策。最近，美国就已建议召开所谓巴黎统筹委员会的十四国高级政策会议，以便对其他国家施加压力，来加紧实施“禁运”。因此苏联代表于1月在联合国经济及财政委员会上发言中说：“苏联认为解决妨碍发展对外贸易的问题具有重大意义。”他并且具体说明“为了寻找在有利于对外贸易收支平衡的原则下对工业品和原料制定公平价格的道路和方法，以及为了尽力排除自由交流物质财富的种种人为的障碍和限制以有利于提高人民的生活水平，苏联代表团认为必须在联合国内建立相当的国际机构。”很明显，苏联这个建议是符合国际局势发展的客观要求的。
    关于帮助不发达国家建立独立的民族经济的问题，客观情况的发展也要求有关国家共同商讨以便通过国际经济合作的途径来求得解决。因为这个问题的情况是一方面不发达国家要求工业化和要求建立独立的民族经济的呼声愈来愈高，而另一方面是帝国主义国家所给予的所谓“援助”的侵略性质已逐渐为不发达国家的政府及人民所认识。已经有不少的国家公开拒绝这种附带有侵犯他们国家独立主权及利益的条件的“援助”。今年1月在联合国经济及财政委员会上，不发达国家的代表已经提出由国际机构而不是由个别国家来给予援助的意见。因此怎样才能真正给予这些国家所需要的援助的问题，便成了目前国际事务中重要的课题了。苏联在这个时候提出在世界经济会议中讨论这个问题是很及时而又恰当的了。
    不论从哪方面来说，苏联主张召开世界经济会议的建议是合情合理的，也是大公无私的，是符合世界上大多数人民利益及要求的。这对帝国主义近数月来企图恢复冷战的狂热症是一付适时的清凉剂。正如谢皮洛夫外长在联合国大会上所说的，“大西洋集团的口号是‘让我们武装起来！’我们的口号是‘让我们进行贸易！’”我们相信，在国际局势继续趋向缓和，在全世界的舆论日益厌弃冷战的情况下，不管现在仍在把持联合国的少数帝国主义国家以及被迫追随他们的国家会不会接受这个建议，像这样一个积极的、对世界和平及各国的切身利益有关的建议，是应当得到世界广大人民的支持和拥护的。
