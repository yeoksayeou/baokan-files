    Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 15th. Leading cadres of the state-owned Shenyang Ceramics Factory have corrected the shortcoming of neglecting concrete leadership, enabling the staff and workers to healthily develop the production increase and savings campaign.
    This factory convened a factory-wide staff and worker meeting as early as January 6th, mobilizing staff and workers to launch a production increase and savings campaign, and arranged for discussions on this year's national plan. However, before the meeting, due to the failure to first organize research and preparation by the departments, the factory headquarters did not earnestly propose concrete measures and targets. Therefore, when the staff and workers discussed this year's national plan, they were clueless, the direction was unclear, and they could not start the discussion. Although specific targets were set for some products, specific measures for increasing production and saving were not arranged, and the staff and workers lacked confidence in completing the targets.
    After the factory leadership discovered this situation, they quickly mobilized department personnel to study the key to improving product quality and reducing costs throughout the factory, and re-formulated a specific plan of measures for increasing production and saving for the whole year. On February 7th and 8th, they organized a second discussion of this year's national plan by all the staff and workers, and the confidence of the staff and workers was greatly strengthened. In the first discussion, the squatting toilet bowl forming workshop set the finished product rate target at 84.09%, and everyone said it could not be completed. In this discussion, after the workers discussed in depth according to the measures proposed by the department personnel, they confidently guaranteed to reach 86.6%.
    At present, all the staff and workers in the factory are actively formulating individual guarantee plans to ensure the overfulfillment of this year's production tasks, and have already put forward more than one hundred major rationalization proposals. According to preliminary calculations: after discussion by the staff and workers, the various economic indicators of this year's national plan can be greatly exceeded. Among them, the total output value will increase by 15% compared with the original target, the cost of comparable products will decrease by 12%, and the finished product rate of sanitary ceramics will increase by 2.8%.

    方向要明确　措施要具体
    沈阳陶瓷厂纠正缺点后，增产节约运动健康发展
    新华社沈阳15日电　国营沈阳陶瓷厂领导干部纠正忽视具体领导的缺点，使职工群众健康地展开增产节约运动。
    这个工厂早在1月6日就召开全厂职工大会，动员职工开展增产节约运动，布置讨论今年国家计划。但是，在召开大会以前，由于没有首先组织科室人员进行研究准备，厂部没有认真地提出具体的措施和指标，因此职工们在讨论今年国家计划的时候，心中无数，方向不明，无法展开讨论。有些产品虽然布置了具体指标，但是没有布置具体的增产节约措施，职工们也缺乏完成指标的信心。
    厂的领导方面发现这种情况以后，很快发动科室人员研究了全厂提高产品质量、降低成本的关键，重新拟定了全年增产节约的具体措施方案。在2月7日、8日又第二次组织全厂职工讨论今年国家计划，职工们的信心大大加强。成型车间职工第一次讨论蹲式大便器的成品率指标为84.09％，都说完不成。在这次讨论中，工人们根据科室人员提出的措施深入讨论以后，满怀信心地保证达到86.6％。
    目前，全厂职工正在积极制定个人保证计划，保证超额完成今年的生产任务，并且已经提出一百多件重大的合理化建议。据初步计算：经过职工讨论以后，今年国家计划各项经济指标可以大大超过。其中，总产值比原指标增加15％，可比产品成本降低12％，卫生陶瓷器成品率提高2.8％。
