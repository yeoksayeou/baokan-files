    Learning Advanced Experiences, Striving for a Bumper Harvest in Agricultural Production
    ——Exhibition and Significance of the National Agricultural Exhibition——
    Jin Shanbao, Director of the National Agricultural Exhibition General Hall
    The National Agricultural Exhibition opens in Beijing today.
    Our country's agricultural production has already achieved great successes and accumulated rich experience in increasing production. In order to meet the growing needs of national economic construction and people's lives, we must use even greater efforts to develop agriculture in the future. The purpose of holding the National Agricultural Exhibition is to widely publicize the great achievements in the socialist transformation and agricultural production of our country since the victory of the revolution, especially during the first Five-Year Plan period, and to rapidly promote advanced production experiences and scientific achievements to state-owned farms and agricultural production cooperatives, striving to complete or overfulfill the various tasks stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) from 1956 to 1967 ahead of schedule.
    The National Agricultural Exhibition also briefly introduces our country's long agricultural history, rich agricultural resources, and precious agricultural products, so that our people can take this opportunity to learn more about the unlimited potential and superior conditions for increasing agricultural production in our country, thereby strengthening our confidence in building socialism.
    After the national liberation in 1949, our country's rural areas carried out socialist transformation and socialist construction on the basis of completing land reform. By the end of November 1956, 96.1% of farmers nationwide had joined agricultural production cooperatives, and the scattered and backward small-scale peasant economy had been basically transformed. The victorious implementation of land reform, especially the agricultural cooperative system, greatly liberated agricultural productivity. Therefore, in the past seven years, great achievements have been made in agriculture, forestry, fishery, water conservancy, and meteorology. The total output value of national agriculture and its sideline industries, with 1949 as 100, increased to 148.5 in 1952, and further increased to 180 in 1956. Grain output in 1956 increased by 152.4 billion jin compared to 1949, exceeding the target for 1957 of the first Five-Year Plan. Cotton output in 1956 increased by 21.61 million dan compared to 1949, an increase of 13.52 million dan compared to the highest year before liberation. The total output of major oil crops such as soybeans, peanuts, and rapeseed in 1956 more than doubled compared to 1949. Other important economic crops such as flax, flue-cured tobacco, silkworm cocoons, tea, and sugar crops have also seen significant growth. In animal husbandry, the number of large livestock in 1956 increased by 27.79 million head compared to 1949, pigs increased by 26.66 million head, and sheep and goats increased by 49.91 million. From 1953 to 1956, a total of 66.53 million mu of wasteland was reclaimed nationwide. Currently, 454 mechanized state-owned farms and large-scale state-owned ranches have been built. From 1950 to 1956, a total of 10.31 million hectares of timber and shelter forests were planted nationwide, 360,000 hectares of state-owned mature forests were thinned and harvested, and more than 1.568 million hectares were closed for afforestation. In water conservancy, while carrying out the management of major rivers, great efforts were made to build farmland water conservancy projects. In 1949, the national farmland irrigation area was 300 million mu, which increased to 500 million mu in 1956. The area under soil and water conservation control reached 209 million mu. The output of aquatic products was 448,000 tons in 1949 and increased to 2.61 million tons in 1956. In meteorology, the number of meteorological stations has increased year by year, reaching 1,404 in 1956, more than nineteen times the number in 1948 before liberation, and more than eight times the number in 1950. These figures eloquently demonstrate how much agricultural production has developed since the victory of the revolution in our country, how remarkable the superiority of the agricultural cooperative system is, and how profound the changes in the face of our rural areas are.
    In the vigorous production movements year after year, many advanced agricultural production cooperatives, state-owned farms, state-owned ranches, and other agricultural, forestry, water conservancy, and aquatic units have emerged across the country, and many advanced individuals have emerged. They have achieved remarkable production achievements and created and accumulated rich advanced production experiences in various production tasks. The various exhibition halls of the National Agricultural Exhibition summarize these advanced production experiences, which is the central content and the most important part of the exhibition, and also the focus of observation and learning for agricultural producers. Grain production is the foundation of the agricultural economy, and cotton is the most important economic crop. Learning advanced production experiences in these two crops is of particularly important significance. Many advanced state-owned farms and agricultural production cooperatives, relying on the superior conditions of collective production, actively and steadily promote various production increase measures and experiences, which greatly increased the yield per unit area. For example, in terms of grain, in 1956, there were four double-cropping rice thousand-jin counties: Chao'an, Guangdong; Haicheng, Changle, and Longxi, Fujian. In other regions, there are also many instances of mu yields of rice exceeding 1,000 jin on large areas. Yun Guang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jieyang County, Guangdong, created a new record of 1,805.2 jin per mu. In seven counties and two cities including Wugong, Shaanxi, the average mu yield of wheat reached more than 300 jin, among which 26 agricultural production cooperatives had an average mu yield of more than 1,000 jin. Hongxing Agricultural Cooperative in Linfen County, Shanxi, also created a new record of 1,341.94 jin of wheat per mu on nearly two mu of land. In many places, typical large areas can be found where the average mu yield of major coarse grains such as corn, sorghum, and millet reaches more than 1,000 jin, and the mu yield of sweet potatoes and potatoes reaches more than 10,000 jin. In terms of cotton, Dunhuang County, Gansu, had already appeared in 1955 with an average mu yield of 100 jin of ginned cotton. In 1956, there were about 3 million mu of land nationwide with an average mu yield of more than 100 jin of ginned cotton. A state-owned farm in the Manas River basin in Xinjiang also created a high-yield record of an average mu yield of 1,686 jin of seed cotton on nearly four mu of cotton fields. After seeing these high-yield achievements and the methods and experiences for achieving them, we can better understand that universally increasing the yield per unit area is indeed the potential for increasing agricultural production in our country. As pointed out in the Resolution on the Political Report of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China: "The main way to increase agricultural production at present is to give full play to the superior conditions that agriculture has basically achieved collectivization, relying on the collective strength of the cooperatives and the support of the government, and adopting measures such as building water conservancy projects, increasing fertilizer application, improving soil, improving varieties, popularizing new-style farm tools, increasing the multiple cropping index, improving cultivation methods, and preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests to increase the yield per unit area. In addition, we should actively reclaim wasteland and expand the cultivated area according to possible conditions."
    The National Agricultural Exhibition reflects the achievements of agricultural scientific research in our country and its significant role in production. In the past seven years, the agricultural scientific research undertaking in our country has greatly developed. There are already 216 agricultural, forestry, fishery, and animal husbandry scientific research units nationwide, plus institutions such as higher and secondary agricultural and forestry colleges and demonstration and breeding institutions. The national agricultural science network has been formed. During the exhibition of the agricultural exhibition, the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences will be announced to be established, which marks that our agricultural science has leaped to a new stage. In terms of research work, the achievements that have been made in the past and the role they have played in production, many facts can be seen in selecting and breeding improved varieties of crops, selecting and breeding excellent seedlings, preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests, preventing and controlling animal diseases, improving soil, increasing fertilizer application, improving farm tools, improving irrigation, as well as preventing wind and sand, preventing natural disasters, and so on. Vigorously publicizing and promoting these important achievements will promote the further development of agriculture in our country. The rich production experience gained by the masses from practice also provides valuable research materials for scientific research work.
    In recent years, the state's support for agricultural production in terms of economy, technology, and talent has also been enormous. The state has issued huge agricultural loans, built many factories manufacturing agricultural production materials, built many large-scale irrigation projects, constructed large areas of shelter forests, provided a large number of new-style farm tools, chemical fertilizers, agricultural pesticides and machinery, biological drugs and other production materials, cultivated a large number of agricultural technical talents, established many agricultural scientific research institutions and technical guidance institutions, established many mechanical tractor stations, pumping stations and other farm tool stations, and trained a large number of agricultural work cadres and farmer technical backbones. The exhibition showcases the enormous effects of these aids in actual work.
    What we should particularly mention here is that in the development of agriculture in our country, the great socialist fraternal Soviet Union and other brotherly countries have given us important material and technical assistance. The Agricultural Exhibition has made a significant exhibition of this internationalist spirit of mutual assistance and friendship, and expresses our heartfelt gratitude.
    The Resolution on the Political Report of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China pointed out: "The current agricultural production in our country cannot meet the growing needs, and we must use greater efforts to develop agriculture in the future." From the various materials exhibited at this National Agricultural Exhibition, it can be seen that agricultural production in our country has extremely huge potential. As long as we work hard, we will improve the level of production and change this situation of imbalance. The "National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) from 1956 to 1967" stipulates: It requires that within twelve years, the average yield per mu of grain should be increased to 400 jin, 500 jin, and 800 jin respectively according to three different regions; the average yield per mu of cotton should be increased to 60 jin, 80 jin, and 100 jin of ginned cotton respectively according to the conditions of various places. As long as this central requirement is met, the various requirements for improving the material and cultural life of farmers put forward in the National Agricultural Development Program will undoubtedly be gradually realized with the development of production. The exhibition materials of the National Agricultural Exhibition tell us that in 1956, in terms of grain, in the three different regions, calculated by county, the average mu yield had reached and exceeded the level required by this program: there were seven counties in the 800-jin region, one county in the 500-jin region, and five counties and cities in the 400-jin region; in terms of cotton, there were 115 counties and cities nationwide, with 17 million mu of cotton fields, and the mu yield of ginned cotton exceeded 50 jin, of which 3 million mu had a mu yield of 100 jin of ginned cotton. Under the current conditions, since so many places and such large areas have already reached and exceeded the level required by this program, then, with the development of national industrialization and the gradual improvement of agricultural production conditions within twelve years, it is entirely possible to complete the agricultural production tasks put forward by this program. The exhibition materials also tell us that our country has extremely rich natural resources available for the development of agricultural production. That is, there are nearly 1.5 billion mu of wasteland that can be reclaimed for cultivation; there are more than 100 million hectares of barren mountains and slopes that can be planted with trees; there are 77% of ocean area and 84% of freshwater area that can be used for aquaculture; there are large areas of grassland that can be used for raising livestock; there are huge water resources that can be used to irrigate fields. The exhibition materials also tell us that our country has superior climatic conditions and very rich products. Among tropical crops, tree species, aquatic species, and products such as mulberry, hemp, tea, silkworms, fruits, and medicinal materials, there are many precious varieties unique to our country, and they have high economic value and are conducive to export and sales. These favorable conditions indicate that the potential for increasing agricultural production in our country is enormous and endless.
      We must be good at learning in order to fully explore this huge potential source of increased production. In particular, we must be good at learning the advanced experience of high-yield agricultural production to universally increase the yield per unit area and ensure the continuous growth of agricultural production. In order to achieve this goal, the Agricultural Exhibition will organize labor models, staff, and leaders from agriculture, land reclamation, forestry, water conservancy, aquatic products, meteorology, and other aspects from all over the country to visit Beijing in a planned way during the approximately four-month exhibition period. At the same time, we will receive people from all walks of life in the capital, citizens, and suburban farmers to visit. In order to help everyone fully exchange production experience, in addition to observing and learning in the museum, we will also hold special report meetings and technical symposiums for labor models and staff from all over the country, show agricultural science and technology films, and also organize provinces, cities, and districts to compile and print more than 200 kinds of pamphlets on advanced agricultural production experience for distribution at the exhibition. The Agricultural Exhibition is not only a compilation of advanced experience in agricultural production, but also a school for learning advanced experience in production. We earnestly hope that the audience attending the meeting, especially the audience who are actually engaged in agricultural work from all over the country, can learn carefully, discuss enthusiastically, and widely disseminate what you have learned, and at the same time, combine it with your own specific conditions, correctly and timely apply it to production work, in order to strive for a greater harvest in 1957.
    The National Agricultural Exhibition is jointly organized by the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Land Reclamation, the Ministry of Forestry, the Ministry of Water Conservancy, the Ministry of Aquatic Products, and the Central Meteorological Bureau under the leadership of the State Council. It is divided into eleven pavilions: the Comprehensive Pavilion, the Crop Pavilion 1, the Crop Pavilion 2, the State-owned Farm Pavilion, the Animal Husbandry Pavilion, the Production Increase Measures Pavilion (divided into six rooms: agricultural machinery, plant protection, multiple cropping, soil improvement, fertilizer, and seeds), the Forestry Pavilion, the Water Conservancy Pavilion, the Aquatic Products Pavilion, the Tropical Crops Pavilion, and the Meteorology Pavilion. More than 2,000 kinds of agricultural, forestry, fishery, and animal husbandry products are exhibited, nearly 5,000 pieces of physical specimens, models, machines, and instruments, as well as a large number of charts, photographs, and other exhibits.
    The National Agricultural Exhibition is the first time it is being held. Thanks to the correct leadership of the higher authorities, the support of relevant departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities and relevant units, the strong help of the Beijing municipal party and government and other relevant departments in the capital, and the enthusiastic efforts of all the museum staff, we were able to overcome many difficulties and complete the exhibition on schedule. We express our heartfelt gratitude here. However, after all, we lack experience, so shortcomings and even errors will still exist. We sincerely welcome the audience to give criticism and corrections.

    学习先进经验，争取农业生产的大丰收
    ——全国农业展览会的展出及其意义——
    全国农业展览会总馆长　金善宝
    全国农业展览会今天在北京开幕了。
    我国农业生产已经取得了巨大的成就，积累了丰富的增产经验。为了适应国家经济建设和人民生活日益增长的需要，今后必须用更大的力量发展农业。举办全国农业展览会的目的，就是要广泛宣传我国革命胜利以来，特别是第一个五年计划时期中农业的社会主义改造和农业生产的巨大成就，把先进生产经验和科学成就，迅速地推广到国营农场和农业生产合作社中去，争取提前或超额完成1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要（草案）中所规定的各项任务。
    全国农业展览会对于我国悠久的农业历史，丰富的农业资源，以及珍贵的农产物品，也简要地加以介绍，使我国人民借此机会更多地了解我国农业增产的无限潜力和优越条件，从而加强我们建设社会主义的信心。
    1949年全国解放以后，我国农村在完成了土地改革的基础上，进行了社会主义改造和社会主义建设事业。到1956年11月底，全国已有96.1％的农户加入了农业生产合作社，分散落后的小农经济已经基本上改造过来。土地改革，特别是农业合作制度的胜利实现，大大地解放了农业生产力。因而七年来在农业、林业、渔业、水利、气象各方面，都取得了很大的成就。全国农业及其副业的总产值，以1949年为一百，1952年增长为一百四十八点五，1956年更增长为一百八十。粮食产量，1956年比1949年增加了一千五百二十四亿斤，超过了第一个五年计划1957年的指标。棉花产量，1956年比1949年增加了二千一百六十一万担，比解放前的最高年增加了一千三百五十二万担。大豆、花生、油菜籽等主要油料作物，1956年总产量比1949年增加了一倍多。其他重要经济作物如麻类、烤烟、蚕桑、茶叶以及糖料作物等，也都有巨大的增长。畜牧业中的大家畜，1956年比1949年增加了二千七百七十九万头，猪增加了二千六百六十六万头，绵羊、山羊增加了四千九百九十一万只。从1953年到1956年，全国共开垦荒地六千六百五十三万亩。目前已建机耕国营农场和大型国营牧场四百五十四处。从1950年到1956年全国共造用材林和防护林一千零三十一万公顷，抚育采伐国有成林三十六万公顷，封山育林一百五十六万八千多公顷。水利事业，在进行各大河流治理的同时，大力兴修了农田水利。1949年全国农田灌溉面积为三万万亩，1956年增长到五万万亩。水土保持控制面积达二亿零九百万亩。水产产量，1949年为四十四万八千吨，1956年增长为二百六十一万吨。气象事业，气象台站逐年增长，1956年已有一千四百零四个，比解放前1948年增长了十九倍多，比1950年也增长了八倍多。这些数字，雄辩地说明了我国革命胜利以后农业生产有了多么大的发展，说明了农业合作制度有着多么显著的优越性，也说明了我国农村面貌有了多么深刻的变化。
    在年复一年的轰轰烈烈的生产运动当中，全国各地涌现出许多先进的农业生产合作社、国营农场、国营牧场和别的农、林、水利、水产等事业单位，产生了许多先进人物，它们或他们在各项生产工作中，取得了显著的生产成就，创造和积累了丰富的先进生产经验。全国农业展览会各个陈列馆内，汇总了这些先进生产经验，这是展览会的中心内容和最重要的组成部分，也是农业生产者应该观摩和学习的重心。粮食生产是农业经济的基础，棉花是最重要的经济作物，学习这两项农作物先进生产经验，具有格外重要的意义。许多先进的国营农场和农业生产合作社，依靠集体生产的优越条件，积极稳步地推行各种增产措施和经验，大大提高了单位面积的产量。例如，在粮食方面，1956年，水稻有广东潮安、福建海澄、长乐、龙溪等四个双季稻千斤县。其他地区，在大面积上亩产水稻千斤以上的事例，也有很多。广东揭阳县云光农业生产合作社，创造了亩产一千八百零五点二斤的新纪录。小麦在陕西武功等七个县两个市，平均亩产达三百斤以上，其中并有二十六个农业生产合作社，平均亩产达一千斤以上。山西临汾县红星农业社还在将近两亩地上创造了亩产小麦一千三百四十一点九四斤的新纪录。主要杂粮的玉米、高粱和谷子等，平均亩产达一千斤以上的，甘薯和马铃薯亩产达一万斤以上的，在不少地方都可找到大面积的典型。棉花方面，1955年已出现了平均亩产皮棉百斤的甘肃敦煌县。1956年，各地大面积平均亩产皮棉百斤以上的，全国约有三百万亩之多。新疆玛纳斯河流域一个国营农场，在近四亩的棉田上，还创造了平均亩产籽棉一千六百八十六斤的高额丰产纪录。看了这些丰产成就，和取得成就的方法和经验，我们更可以理解到，普遍提高单位面积产量，确是我国农业增产潜力的所在。正如中共第八次全国代表大会关于政治报告的决议中所指出的：“目前农业增产的主要途径，就是要充分发挥农业已经基本上实现合作化这个优越条件，依靠合作社的集体力量和政府的支援，采取兴修水利、增施肥料、改良土壤、改良品种、推广新式农具、提高复种指数、改进耕作方法、防治病虫害等项措施，来增加单位面积产量。此外，还应当根据可能条件，积极开垦荒地，扩大耕地面积。”
    全国农业展览会，反映了我国农业科学研究的成就及其应用在生产工作中的重大作用。七年来，我国农业科学研究事业有了很大的发展，全国已有农、林、渔、牧等科学研究单位二百一十六所，加上高、中等农林院校和示范繁殖等机构，全国农业科学网已经形成。在农业展览会展出期间，中国农业科学院就要宣告成立，这更标志着我国农业科学事业跃进到了一个新的阶段。在研究工作上，过去已取得的成就和在生产中发挥的作用，在选育作物良种，选育优良种苗，防治病虫害，防治兽疫，改良土壤，增施肥料，改进农具，改进灌溉，以及防风防沙，预防天灾等等方面都可以看到很多事实。大力宣传和推广这些重要的成就，当会促进我国农业的进一步发展。展览会展出的群众从实践中获得的丰产经验，也为科学研究工作提供了珍贵的研究材料。
    几年来，国家在经济上、技术上、人才上对农业生产的支援，也是巨大的。国家曾发放了巨额的农业贷款，建设了不少制造农业生产资料的工厂，兴修了不少大型灌溉工程，营造了大面积的防护林，提供了大量的新式农具、化学肥料、农用药剂和药械、生物药品等生产资料，培养了很多农业技术人才，设立了很多农业科学研究机构和技术指导机构，设立了不少机械拖拉机站、抽水机站和其他农具站，训练了大批农业工作干部和农民技术骨干。展览会展出了这种种援助在实际工作中所产生的巨大效果。
    我们在这里还应该特别提到的是，在我国农业发展中，伟大的社会主义友邦苏联和其他兄弟国家，都曾给了我们重要的物质援助和技术援助。农业展览会对这种国际主义的互助友好精神，作了显著的展出，并表示我们衷心的感谢。
    中共中央第八次全国代表大会关于政治报告的决议指出：“我国目前农业生产还不能适应日益增长的需要，今后必须用更大的力量发展农业。”从这次全国农业展览会上展出的种种材料看来，我国农业生产有着极其巨大的潜在能力，只要我们努力工作，就会提高生产水平，改变这种不相适应的局面。“关于1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要”（草案）规定：要求在十二年内，把粮食每亩的平均产量，按照三种不同的地区，分别提高到四百斤、五百斤和八百斤；把棉花每亩平均产量，按照各地情况，分别提高到六十斤、八十斤和一百斤皮棉。只要这项中心要求做到了，全国农业发展纲要所提出的提高农民物质生活和文化生活的各项要求，就将毫无疑问地随着生产的发展而逐步实现。全国农业展览会展出材料告诉我们：在1956年内，粮食方面，三种不同地区，以县为单位来计算，平均亩产量已经达到和超过这个纲要要求水平的，八百斤地区的有七个县，五百斤地区的有一个县，四百斤地区的有五个县市；棉花方面，全国有一百一十五个县市、有一千七百万亩棉田，亩产皮棉超过五十斤，其中有三百万亩，亩产皮棉达一百斤。在目前条件下，既已有这样多的地方和这样大的面积，已经达到并且超过了这个纲要要求的水平，那么，在十二年内随着国家工业化的发展，农业生产条件逐步改善后，完成这个纲要所提出的农业生产任务，是完全可能的。展览材料还告诉我们：我国还有极其丰富的自然资源，可供发展农业生产利用。这就是有近十五亿亩的荒地，可以开垦种植；有一亿多公顷的荒山荒坡，可以植树造林；有77％海洋面积和84％淡水面积，可以养殖水产；有大面积的草原，可以饲育牲畜；有巨大的水利资源，可以灌溉田园。展出材料又告诉我们：我国有着优越的气候条件，物产非常富饶，在热带作物、林木品种、水族种类以及桑、麻、茶、蚕、果品、药材等物产中，有很多是我国所特有的珍贵品种，并且经济价值很高，利于输出外销。这些有利的条件，标志着我国农业增产的潜力是巨大无穷的。
      我们要善于学习，才能够充分发掘这种巨大的潜在的增产源泉。特别是要善于学习农业方面高额丰产的先进经验，来普遍提高单位面积产量，保证农业生产量的不断增长。农业展览会为了达到这个目的，在大约四个月的展览期间内，要有计划地组织全国各地农业、农垦、林业、水利、水产、气象等方面的劳动模范、工作人员和领导人员来京参观。同时要接待首都各界人士、市民和郊区农民前来参观。为了帮助大家充分交流生产经验，除了在馆内观摩学习外，还要为各地来京的劳动模范和工作人员举行专题报告会、技术座谈会，放映农业科学技术影片，同时还组织各省、市、区编印了农业先进生产经验小册子二百多种，在展览会上发行。农业展览会不只是农业生产先进经验的总汇，而且也是一座学习先进生产经验的学校。我们殷切希望到会观众，特别是各地实际从事农业工作的观众，能够细致的学习，热情的讨论，并且把你所学到的东西，广泛传播，同时结合自己的具体条件，正确的及时应用到生产工作中去，以争取1957年更大的丰收。
    全国农业展览会，是在国务院领导下，由农业部会同农垦部、林业部、水利部、水产部和中央气象局共同举办的。共分为综合馆、农作物一馆、农作物二馆、国营农场馆、畜牧馆、增产措施馆（分农业机械、植物保护、复种、改良土壤、肥料、种籽等六个室）、林业馆、水利馆、水产馆、热带作物馆、气象馆等十一个馆。展出农、林、渔、牧各项产品的实物二千多种，实物标本、模型、机器、仪器等近五千件，此外还有大量的图表、照片和其他展品。
    全国农业展览会还是第一次举办。由于依靠了上级的正确领导，各省、市有关厅、局和各有关事业单位的支持，和北京市党政方面及首都其他有关部门的大力帮助，同时依靠了所有办馆人员的热情努力，才能够克服了许多困难，按期办好展出，我们在这里表示衷心的感激。但是毕竟我们是缺乏经验的，因之缺点甚至错误仍然是会有的，我们诚恳地欢迎观众们能够给以批评和指正。
