Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 30th. Xinhua News Agency reporter Shao Yongli reports: Before the Spring Festival, Heilongjiang Province dispatched a propaganda army of 750,000 people to extensively conduct political and ideological education work among farmers and workers.

So far, more than 70% of the province's farmers and more than 90% of urban workers and residents have received socialist education, and the enthusiasm of the broad masses for building socialism has reached a new high.

This large-scale political propaganda movement was carried out in urban and rural areas throughout the province for more than 20 days. During this period, the vast majority of party and government leaders at the provincial, municipal, special district, and county levels personally led propaganda teams to go deep into agricultural production cooperatives, immigrant new villages, disaster-stricken areas, and urban streets, factories, and mines to publicize to people of all strata the achievements in socialist construction, the superiority of agricultural collectivization, the spirit of building the country with diligence and thrift, and international current affairs issues.

In the propaganda, party and government leaders at all levels individually visited the homes of many urban and rural residents, understood the ideological situation of the masses, and answered various questions raised by the people. In Nenjiang area, eight counties organized 38 farmer visiting groups to conduct mutual visits and exchange experiences between cooperatives and townships. This not only used concrete examples to publicize the great superiority of advanced collectivization, but also effectively disseminated the experience of running cooperatives and increasing production. Farmers reflected that the visiting groups brought us greater confidence in building socialism, as well as good methods for building socialism.

This propaganda movement was not only large in scale and rich in content, but also more lively in form than before. Industrial and mining cities such as Harbin, Qiqihar, and Jixi organized veteran workers, veteran cadres and veteran soldiers who participated in the Long March and the Anti-Japanese Allied Army, as well as heroes in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, to conduct education on revolutionary traditions, hard work, and building the country with diligence and thrift among the broad masses of workers, especially young workers, with good results. After listening to the reports, many young workers said that they would take those heroic figures as examples to build the motherland. Some young workers originally planned to use their accumulated wages to buy watches and woolen clothes. After listening to these reports, they were very moved and took the money to savings, prepared to buy public bonds, or sent the money to their families in the countryside to invest in production. More than 30 agricultural production cooperative directors invited from the countryside by Hegang City reported to the miners on the achievements of agricultural collectivization and the new look of the countryside, which enabled the workers to have a better understanding of the current production and living conditions of their peasant brothers. The idea that workers and peasants are one family and that industry and agriculture are inseparable became clearer. In rural areas, political propaganda vigorously promoted the current central tasks such as winter production, rectification of cooperatives, and grain procurement. In Xiangyang Township, Yangyuan County, several cooperative members previously wanted to move and withdraw from the cooperative. Now, not only have these households not withdrawn, but also the original few individual households have also requested to join the cooperative. After the political propaganda movement was carried out in Lishuyuan Township, Huachuan County, the amount of procured grain entering the warehouse increased fourfold every day. Lianming Cooperative in Jixian County, which was originally said to be unable to complete the grain purchase task, sold 700,000 more catties of grain to the state after education.

In the in-depth and extensive political propaganda, the masses were educated, and the cadres were also educated. In the countryside, a few grassroots cadres who had negative emotions due to underestimating the achievements of collectivization, not only did not ask to "change shoulders" after being educated, but also actively led the peasants to carry out winter production. Of the 29 party branch secretaries concentrated in Baowan Township, Jixian County for study, eight originally had the idea of "changing shoulders." After receiving education this time, they all expressed that they would better lead the masses to run the agricultural cooperatives well in the future. Among the cadres in industrial and mining enterprises, the idea of running enterprises with diligence and thrift became clearer, and it also promoted the ongoing production increase and conservation movement.

Xinhua News Agency, Yanji, 31st. The Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture in Jilin Province widely launched a large-scale propaganda campaign during the Spring Festival. On the 28th, the propaganda, culture and education, and industrial ministers of the CPC Autonomous Prefecture Committee gave reports to more than 2,300 cadres of all ethnic groups in Yanji City who were preparing to return to their hometowns for the New Year. A group of cadres, led by Yao Xin, the second secretary of the Autonomous Prefecture Party Committee, Cui Cai, the deputy governor, and the ministers of the Party Committee, went to remote rural and industrial and mining areas on the 29th to carry out propaganda work.

This propaganda campaign will last for two months and is unprecedented in scale. All personnel in counties and cities who can participate in propaganda activities have been mobilized. Members of the CPC County Committee and reporters in Yanji County, cadres from agencies and enterprises returning home for the New Year, trainees from training classes, and some middle school students returning home for winter vacation all participated in the propaganda work.

    规模浩大　内容丰富　形式生动
    黑龙江等地开展宣传活动
    新华社哈尔滨30日电　新华社记者邵永力报道：春节前，黑龙江省出动了七十五万宣传大军，向农民和职工等广泛地进行了政治思想教育工作。
    到目前为止，全省已有70％以上的农民和90％以上的城市职工、居民受到了社会主义的教育，广大人民建设社会主义的热情有了新的高涨。
    这次大规模的政治宣传运动，在全省城乡进行了二十多天。在此期间，省、市、专区和各县的绝大多数党、政负责人，都亲自带领宣传队伍，分别深入到农业生产合作社、移民新村、受灾地区和城镇街道、工厂、矿山向各阶层人民宣传社会主义建设中的成就、农业合作化的优越性、勤俭建国的精神和国际时事问题等。
    在宣传中，各级党政负责人个别访问了许多城乡居民的家庭，了解群众的思想情况，解答了人们提出的各种问题。嫩江地区有八个县组织了三十八个农民访问团，进行社与社、乡与乡之间的互相访问和经验交流，不仅以具体事例宣传了高级合作化的巨大优越性，还有效地传播了办社、增产的经验，农民反映，访问团给咱们带来了建设社会主义更大的信心，也带来了建设社会主义的好办法。
    这次宣传运动不仅规模浩大，内容丰富，宣传形式也比以前生动得多了。哈尔滨、齐齐哈尔、鸡西等工矿城市，组织了老工人和参加过长征、抗日联军的老干部、老战士以及抗美援朝中的英雄人物，向广大职工，特别是青年工人进行革命优良传统、艰苦朴素和勤俭建国的教育，效果良好。许多青年工人听了报告以后，表示要以那些英雄人物为榜样来建设祖国。有些青年工人原打算把积蓄的工资拿去买手表、呢子衣服，当他们听了这些报告后，很感动，纷纷把钱拿去储蓄、准备买公债或把钱寄给在农村的家里，交给家人投资生产。鹤岗市从农村邀请的三十多名农业生产合作社主任，向矿工们报告了农业合作化的成就及农村的新面貌后，使工人对农民兄弟当前的生产、生活情况有了进一步的了解，工人农民是一家、工业农业分不开的思想更明确了。在各地农村中，政治宣传有力地推动了冬季生产、整社、征购粮食等当前中心工作。阳原县向阳乡先前有几户社员要搬家退社，现在不但这几户不退社了，原来的少数单干户也要求入社。桦川县梨树园乡在开展政治宣传运动以后，每天入库的征购粮增加了四倍。原来说完不成购粮任务的集贤县联明社，经过教育后，多卖给国家七十万斤粮食。
    在深入广泛的政治宣传中，教育了群众，也教育了干部。在农村中少数由于对合作化成绩估计不足，而产生消极情绪的某些基层干部，经过教育后，不仅不要求“换肩”了，并且积极领导农民进行冬季生产。集贤县集中在保安乡学习的二十九名党支部书记，原来有八人存在“换肩”思想，在这次受到教育后，都表示今后要更好的领导群众把农业社办好。在工矿企业干部中，勤俭办企业的思想更加明确了，并且推动了目前正在开展的增产节约运动。
    新华社延吉31日电　吉林省延边朝鲜族自治州在春节期间广泛展开了大规模的宣传活动。28日中共自治州委员会的宣传、文教和工业部长，分别向延吉市二千三百多名准备回乡过年的各族干部做了报告。以自治州党委第二书记姚昕、副州长崔采和党委部长等为首的一批干部，在29日分头前往边远农村和工矿地区，进行宣传工作。
    这次宣传活动为期两个月，规模空前，各县市所有能够参加宣传活动的人员都动员起来了。延吉县的中共县委委员和报告员，回乡过年的机关、企业干部，训练班的学员以及一些放寒假回家的中学生，都参加了宣传工作。
