    Egypt's Land Reform
		By Our Correspondent Jiang Yuanchun
    About fifty kilometers from Cairo, between the freshwater canal leading to Ismailia and the desert, lies a fertile piece of land. This place is called "Inshas," formerly a manor owned by the deposed King Farouk. After the revolution, this manor was confiscated by the Egyptian government. The entire manor covers 3,628 feddans (each feddan equals 6.3 Chinese mu), of which 1,060 feddans are orchards and 2,568 feddans are farms. The farm portion has been distributed to 708 farmers according to the land reform law. The orchard portion has not yet been distributed. According to the land reform law, orchards should be allocated to graduates from agricultural colleges, so that they can engage in management using modern techniques. The orchard is currently operated by the government, employing 1,000 workers.
    "Inshas" is one of the areas in Egypt where land reform has been implemented, covering 400,000 feddans nationwide. According to the person in charge of the Egyptian Land Reform Department, after the revolution in 1952, the government confiscated and purchased a total of 500,000 feddans of land nationwide, of which 400,000 feddans have been distributed to farmers.
    The total cultivated area in Egypt was 5,960,000 feddans in 1950 and 5,690,000 feddans according to the Egyptian Ministry of Agriculture's statistics in January 1956. According to the 1950 statistics, the concentration of land was very high. According to materials cited in Professor Barawi's book "The Egyptian Military Coup," the land ownership situation in 1950 was as follows:
	Occupation Status		Total Land Area			Number of Owners
	Less than 1 feddan		780,246			1,981,339
	1 feddan – 5 feddans		1,324,030			618,860
	5 feddans – 50 feddans		1,822,379			148,577
	50 feddans – 200 feddans	881,514			9,760
	200 feddans – 2000 feddans	1,154,493			2,115
	Total			5,962,662			2,760,661
    In September 1952, the Egyptian government promulgated the Land Reform Law, confiscating royal land. The decree stipulated that private land ownership should not exceed 200 feddans (equivalent to 1,260 Chinese mu). In addition, landowners could distribute land exceeding this amount to their children, 50 feddans per person, but the total amount should not exceed 100 feddans. In other words, the land owned by the landowner and his children should not exceed 300 feddans (equivalent to 1,890 Chinese mu). Land exceeding this amount was purchased by the government. The government limited the rent to seven times the land tax, prohibiting landowners from arbitrarily raising rents. For the purchased land, the government issued the landowners bonds at a price of ten times the land rent, with a term of 30 years and an annual interest rate of 3%. The purchase work was completed within five years. At the same time, within five years, the government distributed the confiscated and purchased land to landless and land-poor (less than five feddans) farmers, no less than two feddans and no more than five feddans per person. The farmers should pay off the land price in installments within 30 years (calculated at 70 times the land tax or 10 times the land rent), plus an annual interest rate of 3% of the land price, and a handling fee of 15% of the total land price. After the land distribution, the government guided the farmers to organize cooperatives to help them solve the difficulties in production management, fertilizer, seeds, agricultural tools, and draft animals. All farmers who received land must join the cooperative. Therefore, it can be said that Egypt's land reform is to keep those who own 5 feddans to 200 feddans untouched, roughly flatten those who own more than 200 feddans, except for the royal family, to 300 feddans, and use the land obtained from this to fill the land ownership of landless and land-poor owners with less than 5 feddans.
    The land allocated to farmers is not a continuous piece, but scattered in several rotation areas. Because in Egypt, several crops can be planted simultaneously in each season, if many farmers carry out rotation of several crops simultaneously on their adjacent few feddans of land, it will be difficult to maintain the purity of the crop varieties, especially for cash crops such as cotton. Therefore, if a farmer is allocated three feddans of land, they are scattered in three rotation areas, and unified crops in this rotation area are planted according to the season.
    In "Inshas," a cooperative was also organized after the land reform. The Land Reform Department, which leads the land reform work in Egypt, has representatives here to guide the work of the cooperative. The predecessor of the Land Reform Department was the High Committee for Land Reform. The Land Reform Department is not only responsible for land reform, but also for land reclamation, soil improvement, and the organization of cooperatives. At present, 200 cooperatives have been established in areas that have undergone land reform throughout the country.
    We had a conversation with several members of the committee of the "Inshas" cooperative in the bright sunshine. This production management committee has thirteen members, who are elected by more than 700 households of farmers who have been allocated land in the whole village. The committee generally meets every half month to discuss production issues. Recently, the committee held a meeting to discuss the issue of purchasing calves for farmers. The committee also keeps a sum of money, currently 3,100 Egyptian pounds (one Egyptian pound is approximately equal to 7 Chinese yuan), for the purpose of production and construction for the whole community. The funds are collected from each household of farmers. Recently, it was also decided to collect two Egyptian pounds of funds from each household of farmers for the purpose of repairing bridges and building roads in this area. There is a tractor station here, with six tractors. The tractors were first supplied by the Land Reform Department, and after the cooperative was established, the cooperative managed them and paid off the required amount in installments.
    After the land reform, the farmers' tax burden was reduced. In this area, the rent used to be an average of 20 pounds per feddan, but now it is stipulated to be seven times the land tax, 15 pounds (this refers to the rent paid by farmers who rent land from those who own more land). In the areas where land reform has been carried out, the farmers have to pay the land tax and the land price. The land tax varies according to the fertility of the land, ranging from 0.5 pounds to 4 pounds per feddan. The land tax paid by farmers in this area is about 2 pounds per feddan per year, plus a land price of about 10 pounds per feddan per year (the land price is 150 pounds per feddan, which is repaid in 30 years, 5 pounds per year. Plus 3% interest, 4.5 pounds in the first year, plus a 15% handling fee, which is paid in 30 years, about 0.6 pounds per year). In addition to production expenses, the average net income per feddan per year is 34 pounds. Because there are many people and little land in this area, each household was allocated only a little more than two feddans in the land reform. On average, a family of six can obtain a net income of 90 pounds from the land allocated to them, an average of 15 pounds per person. In addition, the family can obtain about 90 pounds from sideline production. In this way, the average annual income per person is 30 pounds. But this figure is relatively high because it is relatively wealthy here. From a national perspective, the average annual income per person is 16 pounds, while before the revolution, the average annual income per person was 10 pounds.
    We inquired about the living conditions of the chairman of the cooperative, Haji Aziz. This is a 42-year-old farmer who looks very simple and honest. The deep wrinkles and large hands on his sun-tanned face show his life experience. He was wearing an Arab robe and answered our questions calmly. Before the land reform, he was a hired farmer and rented two feddans of land from the landlord. Although it was stated that the rent for each feddan of land was 20 pounds per year, in fact, he had to pay rent for everything he grew in the field. This left him with almost nothing except the house he lived in. He had to go to other plantations to work as a hired worker to earn some money to make a living. Currently, there are seven people in his family: a wife, four daughters, a son, and himself. He has a buffalo, a heifer, and a donkey. He was allocated two and one-third feddans of land in the land reform, paying 12 pounds per feddan per year for land fees (land tax and land price), and can get a net income of 20 pounds per feddan, with a total net income of 47 pounds a year. In addition, there is probably sideline income, but he did not talk about it in detail. He only mentioned that he also received 26 Rhode Island chicks from the cooperative. This is a breed of egg-laying chicken that the government is promoting. After they grow up, he will pay 96 eggs (four eggs per chicken) to the cooperative as the price of the chicks. Obviously, the income from selling eggs will be an income.
    The cooperative also runs a veterinary station to treat livestock. The station also offers cattle insurance, which costs one pound and twenty piastres per year. If an insured cow dies, the cooperative will give the farmer a cow. It is said that at first, farmers doubted whether they would really be given a cow, so very few went to insure. Later, facts proved that insurance was indeed beneficial, so everyone went to insure. Now there are 247 buffaloes participating in the insurance. This is a good thing for farmers. Because buffaloes are important draft animals here, and the purchase price of each buffalo ranges from 40 pounds to 60 pounds. If they do not participate in insurance, farmers will not be able to afford to buy one if the cow dies.
    We took a car for a tour around the farm and orchard. The farm was divided into many plots, each about a hundred mu of land. Each plot of land was surrounded by tall trees to protect against the wind and sand coming from the nearby desert. The protective forests in the orchard were planted particularly densely. Surrounded by trees, oranges, tangerines, and lemons were all growing well, bending the branches. The tangerines here are very similar to Xinhui tangerines, and the oranges are like Fuzhou oranges, which taste very sweet. Outside the protective forest is a vast expanse of yellow sand, and irrigation depends entirely on water introduced from the canal. Pumping stations are set up in higher terrain.
    On the way, we visited a village. The village is close to a ditch, and there are several banyan trees at the head of the village, with cattle and donkeys tied under the trees. Groups of children were playing at the head of the village. Egyptian farmers, like Chinese farmers, often suffer from having too many children. It is very common for a family to have six or seven children. The houses in the village are arranged in an E-shape, forming several dead-end lanes, with houses closely adjacent to each other on both sides of the lanes. We visited a family at the entrance of the lane. Pushing the door in, there is a place to tie up livestock. A foot-wide gap is left between the door wall and the roof to let in skylight. The two small side rooms are the kitchen and storage room, filled with harvested large cabbages. Further inside is the bedroom. The bedroom is very dark, and you can barely see a large bed and a small bed with a mosquito net. There is also a baby lying quietly sleeping on the large bed. Next to the bed is a wardrobe with a mirror and a small table. The floor is dirt. The bedroom is so dark, probably to keep it cool in the summer when the sun is scorching. The male owner of the house was not at home. The female owner welcomed us and showed us the harvested large cabbages. One of our reporters even held a large cabbage and took a picture with a smile.
    The houses in the entire village are all mud walls and flat roofs, very similar to the villages on the North China Plain. The internal situation of the houses is also very similar to the farmhouses in some parts of China. Not far from the village, in the middle of the field, several detached new houses are being built. These are new houses built by the Egyptian government for farmers. Some are two stories, some are one story, some are large, and some are small. The houses are built on the farmers' own allocated land. The building material is stone. A two-story house has a place to keep livestock downstairs, a kitchen, a storage room, and a small yard. There are two bedrooms upstairs. The new houses are of course much better than the old houses. The construction cost ranges from 250 pounds to 350 pounds, and the farmers will repay it in installments over 25 years. This is one of the efforts made by the Egyptian government to improve the lives of farmers. It can be said with certainty that the implementation of land reform has brought benefits to farmers. First of all, the rent was limited to seven times the land tax, which prevented landlords from exploiting farmers without restriction. Secondly, some poor farmers were allocated land and could cultivate on their own land without being exploited by landlords. Thirdly, the possibility of large landlords indiscriminately annexing land was also eliminated.
    After the revolution, Egypt's agriculture has developed greatly. According to the Egyptian Ministry of Agriculture's statistics in January 1956, comparing the average output from 1952 to 1955 with the average output from 1950 to 1952, wheat increased by 19%, barley increased by 11%, peas increased by 11%, cotton increased by 10%, sugarcane increased by 10%, rice increased by 24%, and corn increased by 5%. After the restriction of land rent and land reform, the farmers' enthusiasm increased. At the same time, landowners who had reduced their operating area also strengthened the management of their land. In addition, the Egyptian government has taken many measures to promote agricultural production. These are important reasons for the development of Egyptian agriculture.

    埃及的土地改革
                本报记者　蒋元椿
    在离开罗大约五十公里的地方，在通往伊士美利亚的淡水运河和沙漠之间，有一片肥沃的土地。这地方叫做“因夏斯”，从前是已被驱逐的国王法鲁克所有的一座庄园。革命以后，这座庄园已被埃及政府没收。全庄园共占地三千六百二十八费旦（每费旦合六点三市亩），其中一千零六十费旦是果园，二千五百六十八费旦是农场。农场部分，已经按照土地改革法令，被分配给了七百零八户农民。果园部分还没有分。因为按照土地改革法令，果园应被分配给从农学院毕业出来的学生，以便他们可以用现代技术来从事经营。现在果园由政府在经营，雇用工人一千名。
    “因夏斯”是埃及全国已实行土地改革的四十万费旦地区中的一个地区。据埃及土地改革部的负责人告诉我们说，在1952年革命以后，全国由政府没收和征购的土地，共为五十万费旦，其中已分配给农民的为四十万费旦。
    埃及全国的耕地面积，1950年的统计为五百九十六万费旦，1956年1月埃及农业部的统计为五百六十九万费旦。按照1950年的统计，土地集中的程度很高。根据埃及巴拉维教授所著“埃及军事政变”一书中所引的材料，1950年土地占有的情况如下表：占有情况　	所有土地总面积		所有者人数不到一费旦者　	780，246　		1，981，3391费旦—5费旦　	1，324，030　		618，8605费旦—50费旦　	1，822，379　		148，57750费旦—200费旦	881，514　		9，760200费旦—2000费旦	1，154，493　		2，115总　额　	5，962，662　		2，760，661
    1952年9月，埃及政府颁布土地改革法，没收王室土地。法令规定，私人占有土地，不得超过二百费旦（合中国一千二百六十市亩）。此外，土地所有者还可以把超过这个数额的土地分给他的子女，每人五十费旦，但总额不得超过一百费旦。换句话说，土地所有者连同他的子女的土地所有额，不得超过三百费旦（合中国一千八百九十市亩）。超过此数的土地由政府征购。政府限定了地租为土地税的七倍，不许土地所有者任意抬高地租。对于征购的土地，政府按地租十倍的价格，发给土地所有者一种为期三十年、年利3％的债券。征购工作在五年内完成。同时，在五年之内，政府将没收和征购来的土地，分配给无地和少地（少于五费旦）的农民，每人不得少于二费旦，不得多于五费旦。农民应在三十年内分期付清地价（按土地税的七十倍，或地租的十倍计算），以及地价的年利3％，和为地价总数的15％的手续费。在土地分配以后，政府指导农民组织合作社，帮助农民解决生产管理、肥料、种子、农具、耕畜等方面的困难。凡是分到土地的农民，必须加入合作社。因此，可以说，埃及的土地改革，是保持拥有五费旦到二百费旦者不动，将拥有二百费旦以上者，除了王室所有部分外，大致削平为三百费旦，把由此得到的土地，拿来填补拥有五费旦以下的无地和少地的土地所有者。
    农民所分得的土地，不是连成一片，而是分散在几个轮作区内。因为在埃及，在每一个季节里，同时可以种植几种作物，如果许多农民在他们的连成一片的几费旦土地上同时进行好几种作物的轮作，就会使作物的品种难以保持纯良，特别对于像棉花这样的经济作物来说，更是如此，因此，如果一个农民分到三费旦土地，它们就是分散在三个轮作区内，按季节种植本轮作区内统一的作物。
    “因夏斯”这个地方，在土地改革以后，也就组织了合作社。领导埃及土地改革工作的土地改革部在这里派有代表，指导合作社的工作。土地改革部的前身是土地改革高级委员会。土地改革部不仅负责土地改革工作，而且负责耕地开垦、土壤改良和组织合作社的工作。目前在全国已经有二百个合作社在经过土地改革的地区建立了起来。
    我们在明亮的阳光下面同“因夏斯”合作社的委员会的几位委员谈了一次话。这个管理生产的委员会有十三位委员，是由全村七百多户分得土地的农民选举出来的，委员会一般每半个月开一次，讨论生产方面的问题。最近委员会就开过一次会，讨论给农民购买小牛的问题。委员会还保管有一笔资金，现在有三千一百埃镑（一埃镑约合我国七元），作为全社性的生产建设之用。资金是由各户农民征集的。最近还决定从每户农民征集两埃镑的资金，作为在本区内修理桥梁和筑路之用。这里有一个拖拉机站，有拖拉机六部。拖拉机先由土地改革部供给，合作社成立以后，由合作社管理，分期付款，偿还所需的款项。
    在土地改革之后，农民的租税负担减轻了。就这个地区来说，地租从前是平均每费旦二十镑，现在是规定为土地税的七倍，十五镑（这是指农民向拥有土地较多的人租佃耕地所付的地租）。在土地改革了的地区，农民要交纳的是土地税和地价。土地税按土地肥沃程度而不同，由每费旦零点五镑到四镑不等。这个地区农民所付的土地税是每费旦每年二镑左右，另付地价每费旦每年约十镑（地价每费旦一百五十镑，分三十年偿还，每年五镑。另加3％利息，第一年为四点五镑，另加15％手续费，分三十年付，每年约○点六镑）。除了生产开支以外，每费旦每年的纯收入平均为三十四镑。由于这个地区人多地少，所以土改中每户分到的土地只有二费旦多一点。平均一个六口之家，由分得的土地上可以得到纯收入九十镑，平均每人十五镑。另由副业生产全家可得约九十镑。这样全年平均每人可得三十镑。但这个数字是比较高的，因为这里比较富裕。从全国范围来说，每年每人平均收入为十六镑，而在革命以前，平均每年每人收入是十镑。
    我们打听了这个合作社的主席哈齐兹的生活情形。这是一个四十二岁的看来很朴实忠厚的农民，晒得黝黑的脸上的深深的皱纹和粗大的双手，说明了他的生活经历。他穿着阿拉伯长袍，不慌不忙地回答我们的问题。在土地改革以前，他是一个雇农，向地主租了两费旦土地。虽然言明每年每费旦土地的地租是二十镑，但实际上他在地里种出来的一切东西都要缴租。这使得他除了一所住的房子以外，几乎一无所有。他必须到别的田庄上去当雇工，赚一点钱来过日子。目前他家里有七口人：一个妻子，四个女儿，一个男孩子，加上他自己。他有一条水牛，一条小母牛，一匹驴子。他在土地改革中分得了二又三分之一费旦的土地，每费旦每年付十二镑土地费（地税和地价），每费旦可得纯收入二十镑，一年的纯收入一共是四十七镑。此外大概还有副业收入，不过他没有详细谈到。他只谈到了他还从合作社领到了二十六只罗得岛品种的小鸡。这是政府正在推广的一种生蛋用的鸡，等长大以后，他将付九十六个蛋（每只鸡付四个蛋）给合作社，作为小鸡的价款。显然，出售鸡蛋所得会是一笔收入。
    合作社还办有一个兽医站，给牲口治病。站上还举办耕牛保险，每年收保险费一镑又二十个披阿斯特。保了险的牛死了，就由合作社给农民一头牛。据说，最初农民怀疑是否真正会给他一条牛，所以去保险的很少。后来事实证明保险确有好处，大家才去保险。现在有二百四十七头水牛参加保险。这对农民是一件好事。因为这里水牛是重要的力畜，每头水牛买价由四十镑到六十镑不等。如果不参加保险，一旦牛死了，农民一时是买不起的。
    我们坐着汽车，在农场和果园里兜了一圈。农场被划分成许多块，每块大约有一百来亩地。每一块地的四周都种着高大的树林，来防护从近在咫尺的沙漠上来的风沙。果园里的防护林种得尤其紧密。在树林环绕之中，桔子、柑子、柠檬都结得很好，把树枝都压弯了。这里的柑子很像新会柑，桔子像福桔，吃起来非常甜美。而在防护林外面，就是一片浩浩黄沙，灌溉全靠从运河引进来的水。在地势较高的地方设有抽水机站。
    在半路上，我们参观了一所村庄。村庄紧靠着一条水沟，村头上有好几棵榕树，树下拴着牛和驴子。成群的小孩子在村头上玩耍。埃及农民同中国农民一样，常常苦于孩子太多，一家有六、七个孩子，是很平常的事情。村庄里的房屋排列成E字形，形成几条一头不通的巷道，巷道两边就是互相紧挨着的人家。我们参观了在巷口上的一家人家。推进门去，就是一块拴牲口的地方。门墙上和屋顶之间留出一尺来宽的空隙，可以放进天光。旁边两小间侧屋是厨房和贮藏室，里面堆着收获来的肥大的白菜。再往里去就是卧房。卧房里很黑，勉强可以看出有一张大床和一张挂了帐子的小床，大床上还躺了一个婴儿，正在安静地睡觉。床旁放了一个带有镜子的衣柜，和一张小桌。地上是泥地。卧房这样黑，可能是为了在夏天太阳毒辣的时候，可以阴凉一些。这家的男主人不在家，女主人对我们表示欢迎，并且把收获来的大白菜给我们看。我们一位记者还抱了一棵大白菜，笑容可掬地照了一个像。
    整个村庄的房屋都是泥墙、平顶，很像河北平原上的村庄。房子内部的情形，也很像中国某些地方的农家。在村庄对面不远的地方，田野中间正在建筑几幢分立着的新房子。这是埃及政府给农民新盖的房子。有的是二层，有的是一层，有大有小。房子就盖在农民自己的分得的地上。建筑材料是石头。一幢二层楼的房子，楼下有一间关牲口的地方，一个厨房，一间贮藏室，还有一个小院子。楼上有两间卧室。新房子比旧房子当然要好得多。建筑费用由二百五十镑到三百五十镑不等，农民将分二十五年分期偿还。这是埃及政府为了改善农民生活所作的努力之一。可以肯定地说，土地改革的实行，已经给农民带来了好处。首先，地租被限定为土地税的七倍，这就制止了地主无限制地剥削农民的情形。其次，一部分贫苦的农民分得了土地，能够在自己的土地上耕作，不再受地主的剥削。第三，大地主无限制地兼并土地的可能性，也没有了。
    革命以后，埃及的农业已经有了很大的发展。根据埃及农业部1956年1月的统计，拿1952年到1955年的平均产量同1950年到1952年的平均产量比较，小麦增产19％，大麦增产11％，豌豆增产11％，棉花增产10％，甘蔗增产10％，大米增产24％，玉米增产5％。在限制地租和土地改革以后，农民的积极性提高了。同时，被缩小了经营面积的土地所有者，也加强了自己土地上的经营管理。此外，埃及政府采取了许多措施，来促进农业生产。这都是埃及农业发展的重要原因。
