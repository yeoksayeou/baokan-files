    In a Severely Stricken Commune
        By our reporter, Yu Ming

    Last year, all summer and autumn, the houses and fields around Caolaoji in Huaiyuan County, Anhui Province, were soaked in endless floodwaters. People passing through northern Anhui on the Jinpu Railway must have expressed many words of concern for the lives of the farmers there. In the train car, I was deeply moved more than once by this brotherly affection.

    In mid-January of this year, northern Anhui had heavy snowfall, and the weather became particularly cold. The lives of the disaster victims were most difficult at this time. With the same feelings as thousands upon thousands of travelers, I visited the Feiguang No. 1 Cooperative, a severely stricken area.

    This cooperative has more than six hundred households. Last summer and autumn's crops suffered severely from waterlogging, reducing the cooperative's grain production by nearly 90%. The total grain harvested throughout the year was only enough to feed the entire cooperative for four months. This was an extremely rare disaster. Many cooperative cadres and members felt helpless after the disaster, and they only thought of two options: fleeing the famine or waiting for government relief.

    However, the superior conditions of the advanced cooperative and the in-depth working spirit of the cooperative's leaders led the cooperative onto the road of self-salvation through production. Not a single person in the cooperative fled the famine. The vast majority of the members completely eliminated their need for government relief within two months after the disaster. In this severe winter season, what I saw in this severely stricken cooperative was: everyone had something to do, and every member knew how to survive the disaster. Although the water receded relatively late, the cooperative's wheat was planted earlier than in previous years. Now, more than 16,000 mu of verdant wheat seedlings are covered with thick white snow, and a good harvest is expected in the summer. The cooperative helped middle school and elementary school students solve their difficulties in studying, and there were more teenagers attending school in the cooperative than in the bountiful year of 1955. Before the disaster, the cooperative members privately raised only more than 300 pigs; now, not only has the number not decreased, but it has increased to more than 400, with more than 60% more sows than before the disaster. Now, the heavy snow seals the door, but the members are not trapped by the severe cold. The cooperative has signed a contract with a coal construction company, and there is coal and firewood for cooking and heating. Both adults and children wear thick, solid cotton clothes. Piles of reeds are piled up at the doors of every household. Weaving mats with reeds can yield a net profit of 5 jiao per mat, which is a very good sideline production activity to carry out at home in the winter.

    I asked a leading comrade of this cooperative how they led the members onto the road of self-salvation through production.

    He said that the cooperative has more than 1,200 laborers, and after the disaster, more than 800 could be freed up to engage in sideline production. There are more than ten kinds of sideline production that can be done. The income from these sideline productions can enable the cooperative to basically achieve self-reliance.

    In addition to pointing out production avenues to the members and organizing them to produce, the cooperative's leadership is also always concerned with solving the specific difficulties in the members' lives. After the disaster, the cooperative immediately advanced 180,000 jin of wheat and 3,000 yuan of sideline income to the members, so that the members did not feel great difficulties in their lives. Many of the members' houses collapsed, so the cooperative took the public grass and gave it to the members to use, and paid them wheat stalks, and organized masons to repair more than 100 houses for the members. The cooperative has uniformly solved the problems of the members' children attending school and the family's coal burning. More than 200 people in the cooperative fell ill, and the cooperative hired medical personnel to see the members, gave the patients fine grain to eat, and the epidemic was quickly eliminated. The members said with emotion: "In the past, it was difficult to see a doctor in ordinary times, let alone when the flood sealed the door? This collective strength is really great!" Even under such a serious disaster, the cooperative still paid 15 jin of fine grain to the mothers every month to take care of their health. Because the cooperative cared for the members' lives, the members fully developed their enthusiasm for production. Thirteen kinds of sideline production were launched together.

    I rarely saw members in Feiguang No. 1 Cooperative going to the cooperative's office to ask for loans of money and grain. Seeing this situation in such a severely affected area, I couldn't help but be surprised. Another responsible comrade in the cooperative answered this question for me. He said: The cooperative had already checked which families were short of grain and which were short of fuel before it snowed, and the grain coupons and money had already been sent to the members' homes, and cotton clothes had been distributed four times. In addition, the cooperative supplied reeds, and there was money to use reeds to make mats; people who cut grass could get rewards; people who fished had money to sell fish; picking manure for the cooperative could also get one or two jiao in cash a day. They have food, fuel, and pocket money; the members understand the cooperative's bottom line; the cooperative cadres know the members' difficulties; many problems are solved in production, so why bother coming to the office to make a fuss!

    Many members compared the disaster situation in 1952 with last year. They said that the disaster situation at that time was similar to now, but from the disaster in 1952 to the summer harvest of the following year, almost every household relied on government relief, while now with the cooperative, most members only need relief for two months. The pigs raised at that time were all slaughtered; now, with the support of the cooperative, the number of pigs has increased instead. In previous years, with the water receding so late, even if the government lent seeds, it would not be possible to plant one-third of the wheat. This year, in the advanced cooperative, because labor is used uniformly, reed cutting, fishing, grass cutting, Huai River harnessing, carpentry, and ironwork are all carried out as usual, and the wheat is planted early and well.

### 在一个重灾社里

    在一个重灾社里
        本报记者　于明
    去年，整个夏天和秋天，安徽省怀远县曹老集一带的房屋和田地，泡在漫漫的大水里。坐津浦车经过淮北的人们，看到这种情景，不知说过多少关心这里农民生活的话。我在车厢里，不只一次地为这种亲如手足的情谊深深感动。
    今年1月中旬，淮北连降大雪，天气变得特别寒冷起来。灾民的生活，要算这时最为困难。我怀着和千千万万旅客同样的心情，访问了这个重灾区的淝光一社。
    这个社有六百多户。去年夏季和秋季的庄稼，都遭到了严重的涝灾，全社的粮食，减产近90％。全年所收的粮食，只够全社四个月的口粮。这是极少有的灾害。许多社干部和社员，在遭灾后感到束手无策，他们只想到两条出路：出外逃荒，或者坐待政府救济。
    但是，高级社的优越条件和这个社的领导者具体深入的工作精神，却使这个社走上了生产自救的道路。全社没有一个人逃荒。绝大多数的社员，在遭灾后两个多月，就完全不要政府救济了。在这个隆冬严寒的季节里，我在这个重灾社看到的情景是：人人有事做，每户社员都知道自己怎样度过灾荒。虽然水退的较迟，但社里的小麦却比往年还种得早。现在一万六千多亩葱绿的麦苗，被厚厚的白雪覆盖，夏季丰收有望了。社里帮助中学生小学生解决了读书的困难，社里上学的青少年比丰收的1955年还多。全社在遭灾以前，社员私人饲养的猪只有三百多头；现在不但没有减少，反而增加到四百多头，母猪比遭灾前增加60％多。现在，大雪封门，但是社员们却没有被严寒所困，社里同煤建公司订了合同，煮饭取暖有煤炭有柴，无论大人和小孩都穿着厚厚实实的棉衣。家家户户门口都堆放着一堆苇秆。用苇子编席，一张能得净利五角钱，这是冬天在家里进行的一项很好的副业生产。
    我问这个社的一位负责同志，他们怎样把社员引上了生产自救的道路。
    他说，这个社有一千二百多个劳动力，遭灾后，能够抽出搞副业生产的就有八百多个，可搞的副业生产有十多种。这些副业生产的收入，能够使得全社基本上做到自救。
    农业社的领导方面，除了给社员指出生产门路，组织他们去生产以外，还时刻关心解决社员生活上的具体困难。灾后社里马上把十八万斤小麦和三千元副业收入预支给社员，使社员没有在生活上感到大困难。社员的房子倒塌的很多，社里就把公有的草，拿给社员用，并支给他们麦秸，组织泥水匠为社员修理了一百多间房屋。社员子女求学和家庭的烧煤问题，都由社里统一解决了。全社有二百多人得了病，社里请了医疗人员为社员看病，给病人吃细粮，流行病很快被消灭了。社员们感动地说：“过去，平常看病都困难，何况大水封门？这集体的力量，真是大啊！”就在这种严重的灾情下，社里每月还支给十五斤细粮给产妇，照顾母亲的身体健康。由于社里对社员生活上的关心和照顾，使社员充分发挥了生产积极性。十三种副业一起开展起来了。
    我在淝光一社很少看到社员到社的办公室里要求借钱借粮的事。在这样一个重灾区看到这种情况，我不能不感到惊奇。社里的另一个负责同志给我解答了这个问题。他说：哪家缺粮，哪家缺烧，社里在下雪以前早检查过了，粮票和钱早送到社员的家里，棉衣已经发过四次。另外，社里供给苇子，用苇子打席就有钱用；砍草的人能得奖励；打鱼的人有卖鱼的钱；给社里拾粪，一天也能拿到一两角现款。他们有吃、有烧，有零用钱；社里的底细，社员明了；社员的困难，社干部知道；有许多问题都在生产中解决了，哪还需要到办公室来吵吵闹闹！
    许多社员拿1952年的灾情同去年相比。他们说，那时候的灾情和现在差不多，但是，1952年从遭灾到第二年夏收，几乎家家都是靠政府的救济，而现在有了合作社，大多数社员只要救济两个月就行了。那时候养的猪都杀掉了；现在有了合作社的支持，猪反而增多起来。往年，水退得这样迟，就是政府贷种籽，也种不上三分之一的小麦，今年高级社里，因为劳力统一使用，割苇子、捕鱼、砍草、治淮、木工、铁工什么都照样进行，还把麦子种得又早又好。
