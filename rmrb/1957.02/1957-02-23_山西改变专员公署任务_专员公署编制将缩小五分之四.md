Shanxi Changes the Task of the Commissioner's Office
The Commissioner's Office Staffing Will Be Reduced by Four-Fifths

    (Our Newspaper) News: The Shanxi Provincial People's Committee recently decided to change the current tasks of the Commissioner's Office to make it a true dispatched agency of the Provincial People's Committee. This measure is not only an important step in streamlining state organs, but more importantly, it meets the requirements of the current work development in Shanxi Province.

    In its "Decision on Several Issues Concerning the Nature and Tasks of the Commissioner's Office," the Shanxi Provincial People's Committee pointed out: The Commissioner's Office was originally a dispatched agency of the Provincial People's Committee, but in the past few years, due to work needs, it actually functioned as a local government level between the province and the county. Now, because the socialist transformation of the province has achieved a decisive victory, socialist construction has achieved great results, the people's congresses at all levels in the province have been convened, and the work of the people's committees at all levels is gradually improving and becoming more standardized. Under this new situation, it is no longer necessary for the Commissioner's Office to continue to perform its current tasks and continue to function as a level of government. Therefore, in accordance with Article 42 of the "Organic Law of the Local People's Congresses and Local People's Committees of the People's Republic of China," the tasks of the Commissioner's Office will be adjusted and changed, that is: the Commissioner's Office will only perform the tasks of a dispatched agency and play the role of a dispatched agency in the future, and will no longer be used as a level of local government.

    As a dispatched agency of the Provincial People's Committee, the main tasks of the Commissioner's Office are: on behalf of the Provincial People's Committee, to inspect and supervise the implementation of the Provincial People's Committee's relevant policy resolutions and orders in the subordinate counties, but its focus is on rural production and construction and some major policy issues. In order to facilitate the Commissioner's Office in performing its tasks, it has been decided to abolish all the existing work units (sections, bureaus, offices, committees, and divisions, etc.) of the Commissioner's Office in stages and batches; some economic and cultural institutions related to people's livelihoods will be handled by handing them over to the counties, returning them to the province, or temporarily retaining them. The new Commissioner's Office will have inspectors in addition to the commissioner and deputy commissioner. The staffing of the Commissioner's Office is generally forty to sixty people, which is about one-fifth of what it was before the change.

    After the tasks of the Commissioner's Office are changed, the province's leadership will directly oversee the counties. Therefore, the Shanxi Provincial People's Committee has made regulations on issues such as the leadership methods of the province and the Commissioner's Office, the main ways for the Commissioner's Office to perform its tasks, and the relationship between the province, the Commissioner's Office, and the counties.

    山西改变专员公署任务
    专员公署编制将缩小五分之四
    本报讯　山西省人民委员会最近决定把现在专员公署的任务加以改变，使它成为名副其实的省人民委员会的派出机关。这一措施，不仅是精简国家机构的一个重要步骤，而且更重要的是符合山西省当前工作发展的要求。
    山西省人民委员会在它的题为“关于专员公署性质、任务方面若干问题的决定”中指出：专员公署本来是省人民委员会的派出机关，但在过去几年中，由于工作的需要，它实际上在省和县之间起着一级地方政府的作用。现在，由于全省社会主义改造已经取得决定性的胜利，社会主义建设已经获得了巨大成绩，全省各级人民代表大会会议已经召开，各级人民委员会的工作正在逐渐健全和正规：在这种新的情况下，专员公署继续执行现在的任务、继续起一级政府的作用已经没有必要，因此，特根据“中华人民共和国地方各级人民代表大会和地方各级人民委员会组织法”第四十二条的规定，把专员公署的任务加以调整改变，即：专员公署今后只执行派出机关的任务，起派出机关的作用，不再被当作一级地方政权使用。
    作为省人民委员会的派出机关，专员公署的主要任务是：代表省人民委员会，对所属各县关于省人民委员会有关方针政策性的决议和命令的执行情况进行检查和督导，但它的重点是农村的生产建设和一些重大的政策问题。为了便于专员公署执行任务，决定把专员公署现有的工作单位（科、局、处、委员会、室等）分期分批全部撤销；有一些关系人民生计的经济文化机构，则采取交县、归省或暂时保留的办法。新的专员公署，除设正副专员外设督察员。专员公署的编制，一般都是四十——六十人，约为改变前的五分之一左右。
    专员公署的任务改变以后，省的领导将直接对县，因此，山西省人民委员会对省和专署的领导方法，专员公署执行任务的主要方式，省、专、县的相互关系等问题，都作了规定。　（冯重远）
