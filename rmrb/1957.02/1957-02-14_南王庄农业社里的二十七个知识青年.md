In the Nanwangzhuang Agricultural Cooperative of Anping County, Hebei Province, which was started by three poor peasant households, there are eleven young cooperative cadres and sixteen young cooperative members, some of whom are graduates of higher primary schools and some of whom have studied higher primary school courses. After studying, they enthusiastically participated in local agricultural labor and the construction of the agricultural cooperative. Because of their enthusiasm for running the cooperative and their active labor, they are deeply respected and loved by the cooperative members. Some have become leading backbones of the cooperative, have been commended and rewarded by the county Communist Youth League, and have honorably joined the Communist Party of China. For example, Wang Xiaoqi, the deputy director of the cooperative, was once named an advanced youth in water conservancy construction in Hebei Province and also represented the Nanwangzhuang Agricultural Cooperative Youth League branch at the Hebei Province Youth Tree Planting Mobilization Conference. This group of educated youths who participate in agricultural labor and build their hometowns has now become an indispensable new force in running the Nanwangzhuang cooperative, and people praise them as good examples for young people.

Last spring, Wang Xiaoqi—this young student who insisted on taking the road of collectivization with poor peasant Wang Yukun—always believed that as long as the cooperative was well run, he and everyone else could live a happy life of common prosperity. He never refused any work assigned to him by the cooperative and always tried his best to complete it. Last spring, he led a group of cooperative members, mostly young people, to successfully complete the cooperative's assigned tasks of planting trees and constructing water conservancy projects. Last autumn, he also temporarily served as the chief of the accounting section of the cooperative. He was in charge of all the cooperative's cash inflows and outflows. In order to avoid errors in money and accounts, and to avoid losses to the cooperative, he repeatedly counted the amounts of each income and expenditure, and kept timely accounts. In the tens of thousands of yuan of accounts he handled, there was never a single error. Another higher primary school graduate, Wang Junbo, works as a secretary in the cooperative, helping the cooperative's leaders understand the situation, compile statistics, write reports, and make summaries. Last year alone, Wang Junbo wrote more than 300 replies on behalf of the cooperative to well-wishers from other places. Although the work is繁多 and often affects rest, Wang Junbo loves his work very much and says that he will work hard to improve his working ability and help the leaders of the cooperative do a better job.

Among these young students who returned to their hometowns to participate in agricultural labor, some have served as teachers in people-run schools for several years, shouldering the glorious task of spreading cultural knowledge in the countryside. Last year, the five teachers in the people-run school run by the cooperative were all graduates of higher primary schools. Thanks to their efforts, nearly 100 cooperative members in the cooperative persisted in learning culture all year round, basically eliminating illiteracy among the young cooperative members. For example, the young animal caretaker Li Wanmin, who used to be illiterate, has now learned about 2,000 characters after attending people-run school for several years. He can read newspapers, write letters, and keep accounts, and is in charge of writing the blackboard newspaper.

Among these young students, some also actively participated in the propaganda and mobilization work of the agricultural cooperative, which played a great role in helping cooperative members make common progress. Sixteen activists, mainly higher primary school graduates, ran thirty-eight blackboard newspapers, changing the content every five days. In addition to publishing instructions and calls from higher authorities in a timely manner on the blackboard newspapers, they also used the blackboard newspapers to commend and criticize good and bad typical cooperative members, which had a good effect on encouraging advanced people to maintain their glory and enabling backward people to make progress. Last year, the blackboard newspaper commended and criticized a total of more than seventy cooperative members (times).

Among the young students who participated in agricultural production, some have become production experts. Wang Qingmiao, a female higher primary school graduate, had never been to the fields before. When she first participated in agricultural labor, she did not know how to do any farm work. However, she did not lose heart, but persisted in labor and paid attention to learning from the peasants. Finally, she learned various farm work such as planting, hoeing, picking cotton, and accumulating fertilizer. Last year, with the help of agricultural technicians in the county, she also learned new agricultural techniques such as preparing insecticides, artificial pollination of corn, and pruning cotton. Because of her active labor and enthusiasm for running the cooperative, Wang Qingmiao was also elected as the deputy director of the cooperative last year, and she has now become a capable cadre for organizing and mobilizing women to participate in production.

Many of them also persisted in self-study during agricultural labor, which improved their original cultural level. Wang Junbo, the secretary, has improved his cultural level to a certain extent compared to when he left school because he persisted in self-study at work. Now he also often reads newspapers and magazines and studies some theoretical books, striving to continue to improve his level. Thanks to the efforts of these young students themselves, coupled with the fact that the Party branch committee members were assigned to cultivate them, their political awareness has been significantly improved. Last spring, Wang Xiaoqi, Wang Junbo, Wang Qingmiao and other four higher primary school students honorably joined the Party.

When these young students first returned to their hometowns to participate in production, many of them were criticized by some fellow villagers, who said that they had no future in returning to labor after studying. Some of them also felt unhappy in their hearts, feeling that being a "peasant" had no development prospects. However, many cadres and progressive peasants in the village expressed that they needed them and welcomed them, and often gave them some encouragement and support. This increased their courage and confidence to overcome difficulties, and they finally persisted and participated in labor and the agricultural cooperative with pleasure. Wang Shuen, a higher primary school graduate, was not at ease with agricultural labor when he returned to the countryside in 1954, thinking that it was a waste for him to go to school, and he felt very depressed. At that time, the local Party branch secretary and the Youth League branch secretary often talked to him, explaining the development prospects of the countryside and encouraging him to learn from Wang Xiaoqi, Wang Junbo, Wang Qingmiao, and others. In this way, he settled down, and later he actively participated in the agricultural cooperative. Now, Wang Shuen is not only a good cooperative member who loves labor and obeys the cooperative's leadership, but he is also elected as the organization committee member of the Youth League. He said that he will continue to work hard to learn culture, master advanced agricultural technology, and strive to be a new type of farmer, and work with everyone to run the cooperative well.

Under the good influence of this group of young students, more than 100 young cooperative members in the cooperative are at ease with agricultural production, and few people are actively looking for work outside. Moreover, these young people are enthusiastically learning culture and new technologies, expressing that they want to build a new socialist countryside and make their hometown more prosperous and beautiful as soon as possible. At the same time, more than 20 students from Nanwangzhuang who are studying in junior high schools in the county and district have also developed great interest in the cooperative. Many junior high school students who will graduate this summer have said that it is a glorious and promising thing to be able to work and work in the cooperative. These middle school students actively participate in the cooperative's labor and work during their vacations back home.

    南王庄农业社里的二十七个知识青年
    新华社记者　邓子常
    在三户贫农带头办起来的河北省安平县南王庄农业社里，有十一个青年社干部和十六个青年社员，他们有的是高小毕业生，有的读过高小课程。他们学习后热情地参加了本乡的农业劳动和农业社的建设工作，因为他们办社热情，劳动积极，深受社员们的尊敬和爱戴。有的人已成为社的领导骨干，受到过县青年团的表扬和奖励，并光荣地参加了中国共产党。如社的副主任王小其就曾被评选为河北省青年水利建设积极分子，还曾代表南王庄农业社青年团支部出席过河北省青年植树造林积极分子大会。这一批参加农业劳动、建设家乡的知识青年现在已成了南王庄社办社不可缺少的新生力量，人们夸奖他们是青年人的好榜样。
    去年春天，王小其——这个和贫农王玉坤一起坚持走合作化道路的青年学生，一直相信只要把社办好，自己和大伙就能过上共同富裕的幸福生活，凡是社里分配给他的任何工作，从不推辞，总是尽自己最大力量去完成。他在去年春天领导一批青年人占多数的社员出色地完成了社分给的植树造林和兴修水利的任务，去年秋后又临时兼任过社里的会计股长。他主管着全社的进出现金，为了不让错钱和掉账，免得给合作社带来损失，每次收入和支出款项时，都要反复清点数目，及时记账，在他经手的好几万元账目中，从未出过一笔差错。另一个高小毕业生王俊波在社里担任着秘书工作，帮助社的领导了解情况、统计数字、写汇报和作总结等。去年，只王俊波代表合作社写给外地关怀者的回信就有三百多封。虽然工作繁多，往往影响休息，但王俊波很热爱自己的工作，表示要努力提高工作能力，帮助社的领导把工作搞得更好些。
    在这批回乡参加农业劳动的青年学生中，有些人已经当了几年民校教师，肩负着在农村传播文化知识的光荣任务。去年，合作社举办的民校，五位教师都是由高小毕业生充当的。由于他们的努力，使得这个社有近百名社员坚持了常年学文化，基本上扫除了全社青年社员中的文盲。如青年饲养员李万民，过去一字不识，后来进了几年民校，现在已经识了两千字左右，能够读书看报，写信记账，担任了写黑板报的工作。
    在这批青年学生中，有些还积极参加了农业社的宣传鼓动工作，对帮助社员共同进步起了很大作用。由十六名以高小毕业生为主的积极分子，主办了三十八块黑板报，五天换一次内容，他们除了在黑板报上及时刊登上级发出的指示和号召，还利用黑板报表扬和批评好坏典型社员，这对鼓励先进者保持光荣，落后者得到进步，收到了良好效果。去年黑板报表扬和批评的社员共有七十多人（次）。
      在参加农业生产的青年学生中，有些已经成为生产能手。女高小毕业生王清渺，原先没有下过地，最初参加农业劳动的时候什么农活也不会干。但是她没有灰心，一直坚持劳动，并注意向农民学习，终于学会了种地、锄地、摘棉花、积肥等各种农活。去年她又在县农业技术干部的帮助下，学会了配制杀虫药剂、玉米人工授粉、棉花整枝等新的农业技术。王清渺因为劳动积极和办社热心，去年也被选为社的副主任，现在她已成了组织动员妇女参加生产的得力干部。
    他们中不少人在农业劳动中还坚持了自学，提高了他们各自原有的文化水平。秘书王俊波，由于在工作中坚持了自学，他的文化水平比出校时已经有了一定程度的提高。现在他还经常阅读报纸和杂志，学习一些理论书籍，争取继续提高自己的水平。由于这些青年学生自己的努力，加之党支部委员分工负责培养他们，因而他们的政治觉悟都有了显著的提高。去年春天，王小其、王俊波、王清渺等四个高小学生，都已光荣地入了党。
    这些青年学生当初回乡参加生产时，也有不少人受到好些乡亲的责难，说他们念了书回来劳动没有出息。他们中间有的人自己心里也不痛快，觉得当“庄稼汉”没有发展前途。但是，村里很多干部和进步农民却表示需要他们，欢迎他们，并经常给他们一些鼓励和支持。这样就增加了他们克服困难的勇气和信心，终于坚持了下去，心情愉快地参加了劳动，参加了农业社。高小毕业生王树恩，1954年才回到农村时，对农业劳动不安心，认为自己进学校算是白搭了，心里很苦闷。当时，当地党支部书记和青年团支部书记就经常找他谈话，向他讲解农村的发展远景，鼓励他好好向王小其、王俊波、王清渺等学习。这样，他才安下心来，以后他又积极地参加了农业社。现在，王树恩不但是个热爱劳动、服从社领导的好社员，而且当选为青年团的组织委员。他说，他要继续努力学文化，掌握先进的农业技术，争取做个新型农民，和大伙一起把合作社办好。
    在这批青年学生的良好影响下，使这个社的一百多名青年社员，都安心于农业生产，很少有人活动要出外找工作了。而且这些青年人都热情地学习着文化和新技术，表示要建设社会主义的新农村，使家乡早日变得更加富裕和美丽。同时，南王庄现有二十多名在县、区初中念书的学生也对合作社发生了很大的兴趣。不少将在今年暑假毕业的初中学生曾经表示：能够在社里劳动和工作，真是一件又光荣又有前途的好事。这些中学生假期回乡，都积极地参加社里的劳动和工作。
