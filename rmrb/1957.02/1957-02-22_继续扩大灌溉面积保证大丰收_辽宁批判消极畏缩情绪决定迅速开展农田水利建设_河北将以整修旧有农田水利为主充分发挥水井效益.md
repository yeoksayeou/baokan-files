Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 21st. Liaoning Province, which has already achieved tremendous success in farmland water conservancy construction, will strive to increase grain production by another 250,000 tons for the country in farmland water conservancy this year. This was initially determined at the Liaoning Provincial Water Conservancy Conference, which closed in Shenyang on the 18th, after summarizing last year's experiences and lessons, criticizing negative and conservative sentiments, and analyzing various favorable conditions.

Last year was a year of unprecedented development in farmland water conservancy construction in Liaoning Province. The province completed more than 10,000 mass-based river interception and irrigation projects, more than 8,000 small reservoirs and ponds, developed more than 180,000 hectares of paddy fields, and improved water and soil conservation control areas of more than 260,000 hectares. Of these projects, 80% to 90% played a significant role in increasing agricultural production last year, increasing grain production by more than 400,000 tons. However, there were also many problems in last year's farmland water conservancy construction work. After criticizing right-leaning conservative thinking, many places developed a blind, rash advance and a tendency to be greedy and seek large projects, constructing some large-scale water conservancy projects and digging many abandoned wells. Since last autumn, due to only seeing one side of the problem and ignoring that achievements were the main aspect, a widespread sense of timidity has arisen in various places, and they dare not continue to develop farmland water conservancy construction this year. In some counties, the leadership planned not to approve water conservancy projects proposed by the masses themselves.

In response to this situation, after summarizing the tremendous achievements of last year's water conservancy construction and identifying shortcomings and lessons, the conference focused on criticizing the new conservative thinking and the sentiment of retreating and not moving forward that currently exists in leadership departments at all levels. After several days of discussion at the conference, everyone initially realized that this way of thinking not only does not conform to the requirements of the central and provincial authorities to "try every possible means to strive for a bumper harvest in agriculture this year," but also, if not immediately overcome, will inevitably affect the enthusiasm of farmers. Therefore, the participants all expressed that they would continue to lead the farmers back to their respective areas and rapidly launch this year's farmland water conservancy construction work.

After analyzing the characteristics of Liaoning Province, which has many mountains and waters, low unit area yield in mountainous areas, and great potential for water conservancy development, as well as the favorable conditions for developing farmland water conservancy construction, the conference initially determined to further develop 55,000 hectares of paddy fields, expand the irrigation of dry land by 45,000 hectares, develop ditch and ridge fields, control soil erosion areas of 230,000 hectares, and build flood control and drainage projects this year. It is estimated that after the completion of these projects, 600,000 hectares of low-lying areas in the province can be spared from water damage, and more than 250,000 tons of grain can be produced for the country.

Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 21st. Various parts of Hebei Province are vigorously restoring and repairing small-scale farmland water conservancy projects. After the completion of the projects in various places, a total of more than 30 million mu of farmland can be irrigated.

Last year, Hebei Province dug more than 560,000 various water wells and built some small pumping stations, reservoirs, and canal projects, which has increased the province's irrigated area to more than 27 million mu, an increase of 2.4 times compared to the total irrigated area in the first three years of the First Five-Year Plan. However, many projects were also damaged due to the extraordinarily large flood last year. Therefore, in carrying out small-scale farmland water conservancy work this year, Hebei Province has decided to focus on restoring and repairing existing projects, and at the same time build some projects in areas where conditions permit, striving to expand the irrigated area by another 4 million mu on the basis of restoring the original irrigated area.

Currently, various places are actively carrying out this work. In Shijiazhuang Prefecture, more than 4,000 canal banks were destroyed by floods last year, and more than 1,300 have now been repaired; of the 20,000 water wells destroyed by floods, more than 4,400 have been repaired in sixteen counties alone. In Qingyun and ten other counties in Cangxian Prefecture, not only have many old wells damaged by water been repaired, but also eleven boiler engines and 154 five-wheel water carts and hand-operated water carts have been purchased to actively prepare for expanding the irrigated area. The Xianfeng Agricultural Cooperative in Mancheng County is repairing and deepening the original 25 old wells, and will also dig some new water wells and mechanized wells, striving to turn all 980 mu of cultivated land into irrigated land.

Hebei Province suffered from floods last year, and many farmland water conservancy facilities were not utilized, so the development of farmland water conservancy work in various places was sluggish in the previous period. In order to reverse this situation, some counties organized cadres to go to the countryside to be responsible for inspecting and supervising this work; some counties held three-level cadre meetings, listing this work as one of the central tasks of the current rural areas; some places also summarized the farmland water conservancy work of the past year, affirming the achievements. In this way, the confidence of the masses of farmers in continuing water conservancy work has been enhanced, and the progress of this work has been powerfully promoted.

### 继续扩大灌溉面积保证大丰收  辽宁批判消极畏缩情绪决定迅速开展农田水利建设  河北将以整修旧有农田水利为主充分发挥水井效益

    继续扩大灌溉面积保证大丰收
    辽宁批判消极畏缩情绪决定迅速开展农田水利建设
    河北将以整修旧有农田水利为主充分发挥水井效益
    新华社沈阳21日电　农田水利建设已获得巨大成就的辽宁省，今年将争取在农田水利方面再为国家增产粮食二十五万吨。这是18日在沈阳市闭幕的辽宁省水利会议上，经过总结去年经验教训，批判消极保守情绪，分析了各种有利条件之后初步确定下来的。
    去年是辽宁省农田水利建设空前发展的一年。全省共完成各种群众性的截河引水灌溉工程一万多处，小型水库塘坝八千多处，开发水田十八万多公顷，修整水土保持控制面积二十六万多公顷。这些工程，有80％到90％在去年农业增产中起了显著作用，增产粮食四十多万吨。但是，在去年农田水利建设工作中也存在着很多问题。批判右倾保守思想之后，很多地方产生了盲目冒进、贪多求大的偏向，兴修了一部分大型水利工程和打了许多废井。去秋以来，各地由于只片面地看到了问题的一面，忽略了成绩是主要的，因而又普遍产生了畏缩情绪，对今年农田水利建设不敢再继续发展。有的县群众提出要自己修建的水利工程，领导上也打算不予批准。
    针对这种情况，会议在总结了去年一年水利建设的巨大成就和找出缺点、教训以后，着重批判了当前在各级领导部门中存在的新的保守思想和退缩不前的情绪。经过几天会议的讨论，大家初步认识到这种思想情绪不仅不符合中央和省里提出的“想尽一切办法，争取今年农业大丰收”的要求，而且如果不立即克服，必将影响农民的积极性。因此，与会人员都表示，回去后要继续领导农民，把今年的农田水利建设工作迅速开展起来。
    会议分析了辽宁省多山多水，山地单位面积产量低、水利潜力大等特点和发展农田水利建设的有利条件后，初步确定了今年再发展水田五万五千公顷、扩大旱田灌溉四万五千公顷、搞沟洫畦田、控制水土流失面积二十三万公顷，并兴修防洪排涝等工程。预计，这些工程完工后，可使全省六十万公顷涝洼地区免遭水害，能为国家增产粮食二十五万多吨。
    新华社保定21日电　河北省各地正在大力恢复和兴修小型农田水利工程。各地的工程完工后，共可灌溉农田三千多万亩。
    去年河北省共打各种水井五十六万多眼，并且兴建了一些小型的抽水机站、水库和渠道等工程，已使全省灌溉面积达到二千七百多万亩，比第一个五年计划头三年灌溉总面积扩大了二点四倍。但是，由于去年遭到特大洪水的袭击，也毁坏了很多工程。因此，今年河北省在开展小型农田水利工作方面，决定以恢复整修旧有工程为主，同时在有条件的地区兴修一些工程，争取在恢复原有灌溉面积的基础上，再扩大灌溉面积四百万亩。
    目前，各地正在积极进行这一工作。石家庄专区去年被洪水冲毁的渠滩有四千多处，现已修复一千三百多处；被洪水冲毁的水井有两万眼，只十六个县即已修好四千四百多眼。沧县专区庆云等十个县，不但修好了许多被水冲坏的旧井，还购置了十一台锅驼机，一百五十四辆五轮水车和手摇水车，积极准备扩大灌溉面积。满城县先锋农业社，正在整修和深锥原有的二十五眼旧井，还要新打一些水井和机井，争取要把九百八十亩耕地全部变成水浇地。
    河北省去年遭受水灾，很多农田水利设施没有利用起来，因而前一时期各地开展农田水利工作表现消沉。为了扭转这种局面，有些县组织干部下乡，负责检查督促这一工作；有些县召开了三级干部会议，把这一工作列为当前农村中心任务之一；有些地方还总结了过去一年的农田水利工作，肯定了成绩。这样，增强了农民群众继续进行水利工作的信心，有力地推动了这一工作的进行。
