Xinhua News Agency Report: The Shanghai Public-Private Joint Anle Rayon Factory, according to a recent decision by relevant departments, will resume production in its original location on a small scale.

The main reason this factory had not been put into production in the past few years was that its location was near a residential area in the western part of Shanghai, and the production of rayon would generate waste gases harmful to human health – hydrogen sulfide and carbon disulfide. Now, after research by several experts at home and abroad, it has been decided to build a 70-meter-high chimney to dilute the waste gas at high altitude, which is estimated not to be harmful to people's health. However, to be cautious, relevant departments have decided that after the factory resumes production, it will first produce 500 kilograms of rayon per day (based on the existing equipment capacity, it can produce one and a half tons per day). While producing, it will use scientific methods to measure the concentration of waste gas in the air to study whether it harms human health, and then further decide whether to expand or reduce production.

    安乐人造丝厂将恢复生产
    据新华社讯　上海公私合营安乐人造丝厂，最近经有关部门决定在原地小量地恢复生产。
    这个厂过去几年没有投入生产的主要原因是厂址设在上海市西部的住宅区附近，生产人造丝要产生有害人体健康的废气——硫化氢和二硫化碳。现在，经国内外若干专家研究结果，决定建筑一个七十公尺高的大烟囱，让废气在高空中稀释，估计这样就不会有害人民健康。但是为了慎重起见，有关部门决定这个厂在恢复生产后，首先日产人造丝五百公斤（按现有设备能力，每天能生产一吨半），一面生产，一面用科学方法测量空气中的废气浓度，研究是否损害人体健康，然后再进一步决定扩大或缩小生产。
