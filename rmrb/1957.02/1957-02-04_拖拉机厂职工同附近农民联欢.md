(Our Newspaper, Luoyang, 3rd dispatch) A warm and lively workers and farmers get-together is taking place in the square of Sunqitun, a collective farm near the tractor factory, amidst heavy snowfall. This is the noon of the second day of the Lunar New Year, and workers and farmers are sitting shoulder to shoulder in rows on benches at the venue. They are attentively listening to the representatives uttering heartwarming words: The villagers have taken such good care of our families. In order to respond to your enthusiastic help, the machines in some workshops of three of our plants have already started running... Farmer Zhang Shuying then said: You have built the tractor factory so well! We salute you! We will further improve our support work so that you can carry out production even better! Sun Dongsheng also reported the farm's production achievements this year to the worker elders, saying: Out of the entire village's 6,409 mu of land, the multiple cropping area has increased from 50% in previous years to 80%, and the annual output has increased by more than 28%. Out of the 519 households in the village, 415 have increased their income, and only 13 households engaged in other occupations have experienced a decrease in income. In the future, we will run the farm even better in the spirit of diligence and frugality, so that workers and farmers can advance side by side and jointly build socialism well.

　　Qiu Yuehua, holding a one-year-old boy in her arms, and Guo Yuzhen, a mother of four, are both family members of tractor factory workers; they came from Shanghai last October. They said that they originally thought that coming to Luoyang, being unfamiliar with the place and not understanding the language, would be cold and lonely, but after arriving here, they did not feel that way at all. A total of 108 households of tractor factory workers' families live in this village, and most of them get along very well with the farmers. This get-together added to their infinite joy. The snow fell heavier and heavier, and the white-haired elders sat smiling at the venue, enjoying the handbell dance and autumn harvest dance performed by the farm's primary school students.

    拖拉机厂职工同附近农民联欢
    本报洛阳3日电　拖拉机厂附近集体农庄——孙旗屯的广场上，正在大雪纷飞中举行热情洋溢的工农联欢。这是正月初二的正午，工人和农民肩并肩地成排成列地坐在会场的板凳上。他们聚精会神地听到代表们一字一句地吐出打动人心的话语：老乡们对我们的家属照顾得太好了，为了回答你们的热情帮助，我们有三个工场的部分车间的机器已经开始转动……农民张书英接着说：你们把拖拉机厂建设得这样好！我们向你们致敬！我们要进一步地做好支援工作，让你们能更好地进行生产！孙东生也把农庄今年的生产成绩向工人老大哥作了报告。他说：全庄六千四百零九亩地，复播面积由往年的50％提高到80％，年产量提高了28％以上。全村五百十九户有四百十五户增加了收入，只有十三户兼搞其他职业的才减少了收入。今后要本勤俭办社精神把农庄办得更好，做到工农并驾齐驱，共同建好社会主义。
    怀里抱着一岁男孩站在会场角上的仇月华，和有了四个孩子的母亲郭玉珍，都是拖拉机厂的职工家属；她们是去年10月从上海来的。她们说，原来以为来洛阳人地生疏，话不懂，一定冷冰冰的，但是到了这里，她们丝毫没有这样的感觉。这个屯子共住一百零八户拖拉机厂的职工家属，她们大多和农民相处得很好。这次联欢大会，更给他们添加了无限的快乐。雪越落越大，白发老人们笑盈盈地坐在会场欣赏着农庄小学生表演的手铃舞和秋收舞。　（张健虹）
