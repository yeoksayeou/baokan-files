Xinhua News Agency, 19th: The National Agricultural Labor Model Representatives Conference continued its plenary session today.

At the meeting, Soviet expert Kang Minsky, who works at the Ministry of Agriculture, introduced the achievements of Soviet agricultural production in 1956 to the representatives, giving tremendous encouragement to all the representatives. He said: The historic victory achieved by agricultural cooperativization undoubtedly created extremely favorable conditions for the further development of Chinese agriculture. Socialist agricultural cooperatives have enormous potential for further increasing production, and members and agricultural workers can fully utilize this potential to achieve new and greater achievements in 1957. The Soviet working people are proud of the victory of the Chinese people.

Subsequently, representatives from various regions continued to speak at the conference. A total of thirteen people spoke today. In their speeches, the representatives used their specific facts to prove the superiority of the collectively managed agricultural cooperative system in developing production, increasing income, and resisting natural disasters.

Sun Shuduo, director of the "Socialism Road" Agricultural Cooperative in Aihui County, Heilongjiang Province, reported to the conference that the average income of the cooperative's members doubled last year. This cooperative is located in the northernmost part of China, with a frost-free period of only about 110 days, and in the past, cultivation was extensive and yields were low. However, after the realization of advanced cooperativization last year, the level of production greatly improved. Due to the high yields last year, the labor income of the members increased. Xue Mingyu, a 62-year-old member of our cooperative, earned 800 yuan in labor income last year, an increase of nearly four times compared to 1955. Even Li Shuxian, a widow with two children, had a total annual income of more than 500 yuan. He said: If it weren't for the fully socialist agricultural cooperativization, it would be difficult to get rid of poverty and change the past situation of low yields.

Wang Yukun, director of the famous Nanwangzhuang Agricultural Cooperative in Anping County, Hebei Province, which was founded by three poor peasant households, emphasized in his speech today that only cooperativization has the strength to transform certain natural conditions unfavorable to agricultural production. He said: Nanwangzhuang is surrounded by large white sandy land, but now, the whole cooperative has planted more than 40,000 apple, poplar, and pepper trees around the sandy land, and built a four-mile-long windbreak forest in the northwest of the village. In a few years, the sandy landscape here can be changed and agricultural production can be improved. We have also made some achievements in farmland water conservancy construction. The situation of flooding last year was serious, but the harvest of less affected crops still exceeded the yields of previous years. Wang Yukun finally stated that their cooperative has received care from all sides because it insisted on taking the socialist road in the early stage of cooperativization. This spurred them to continue to work hard to run the cooperative better, to continue to adhere to the principles of diligence and thrift in running the cooperative and democratic management, to absorb the advanced experiences of various places in increasing production, and to strive for a bumper harvest this year.

Also speaking at today's meeting were Zheng Mingyuan, director of the Sanshan Agricultural Cooperative in Zhenhai County, Zhejiang Province, who overcame typhoon disasters; Lu Hongbin, director of the Patriotic Agricultural Cooperative in Ju County, Shandong Province, a nationally renowned agricultural labor model; Xiong Kaiming (Miao nationality), director of the Huayan Agricultural Cooperative in Anshun County, Guizhou Province, who led the whole cooperative to achieve overall increases in rice and wheat production; Xue Zhanchun, representative of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, who created the highest unit area yield of cotton in the country; Bai Zongjin, representative of Chang'an County, Shaanxi Province, who has achieved continuous bumper harvests of wheat in recent years; and representatives from Jiangsu, Henan, Gansu, Inner Mongolia, Jilin, Liaoning and other provinces and regions, a total of thirteen people.

    全国农业劳动模范代表会议继续大会发言
    合作化使生产水平显著提高
    “社会主义之路”农业社去年社员平均收入增加一倍
    南王庄农业社依靠集体力量改造不利生产的自然条件
    新华社19日讯　全国农业劳动模范代表会议今天继续举行全体大会。
    会上，在农业部工作的苏联专家康民斯基向代表们介绍了1956年苏联农业生产的成就，给了全体代表莫大的鼓舞。他说：农业合作化所取得的历史性的胜利，毫无疑问地给中国农业的进一步发展创造了极其有利的条件。社会主义农业社具有进一步增产的巨大潜力，社员们和农业工作者们能够充分利用这些潜力在1957年取得新的更大的成就。苏联劳动人民为中国人民的胜利而感到骄傲。
    接着，各地代表继续在大会上发言。今天发言的共十三人。代表们在发言中，都以各自的具体的事实证明了集体经营的农业合作化制度在发展生产、增加收入和抵抗自然灾害等方面的优越性。
    黑龙江省瑷珲县“社会主义之路”农业社主任孙书铎向大会报告说：去年这个社的社员的平均收入增加了一倍。这个社在我国的最北部，无霜期只有一百十天左右，过去耕作粗放，产量不高。但在去年实现高级合作化后，生产水平就有很大提高。由于去年的产量高，社员的劳动收入就增多了，我社一个六十二岁的老年社员薛明玉，去年他的劳动收入就达八百元，比1955年增加将近四倍。就连有两个孩子的寡妇李淑贤，全年的收入也达五百多元。他说：如果不是实现了完全社会主义的农业合作化，要摆脱贫困改变过去产量低下的情况是很困难的。
    从三户贫农坚持办社的著名的河北省安平县南王庄农业社主任王玉坤在今天的发言中，着重说明了只有合作化，才有力量改造某些不利于农业生产的自然条件。他说：南王庄周围都是大白沙地，而现在，全社在沙地的周围栽了四万多棵苹果、大白杨和花椒等树，村西北还造了四里多长的防风林。再过几年就可以改变这里的风沙面貌，提高农业生产。在农田水利建设方面我们也取得一些成就。去年雨涝的情况是严重的，但是受灾较轻的作物收获量还是超过了历年的产量。王玉坤最后还表示：他们的社由于合作化初期坚持走社会主义的道路，因而受到各方面的关怀。这鞭策着他们要继续努力把社办得更好；继续坚持勤俭办社和民主办社的方针，吸取各地的先进增产经验，争取今年的丰收。
    在今天会议上发言的，还有战胜台风灾害的浙江省镇海县三山农业社主任郑明远、山东省莒县爱国农业社主任全国著名农业劳动模范吕鸿宾、领导全社获得稻麦全面增产的贵州省安顺县华严农业社主任熊开明（苗族）、创造全国棉花单位面积最高产量的新疆生产建设兵团代表薛占春，有几年来获得小麦连续丰产的陕西长安县代表柏宗缙，以及江苏、河南、甘肃、内蒙古、吉林、辽宁等省、区的代表共十三人。
