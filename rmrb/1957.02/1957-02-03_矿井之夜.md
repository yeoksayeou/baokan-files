    Night in the Coal Mine
		Xinhua News Agency reporter Ren Jiaji
    Near the mine entrance, streetlights are sparse, and the sound of coal trucks speeding by is absent. This is the usual scene at the Jingxi Coal Mine on holidays. But the eve of the Spring Festival is a moment of quiet before the tense production.
    The miners of the Chengzi Mine exceptionally refrained from drinking the festive evening's wine and began arriving at the mine entrance shortly after eight o'clock. The locker room was brightly lit, with people flowing in and out. Simultaneously, preparation meetings for the first production shift during the Spring Festival were held in the mining and tunneling work sections.
    The winding engine at the mine entrance roared continuously, and the number of people waiting to ride down the shaft grew larger and larger. More than a dozen miners who were supposed to be off work for the holiday also came, fearing that someone might be absent, but every group had full attendance. Guan Dabao, a mining worker, had set off on January 27th to return to his hometown of Xiong County to visit his parents. While resting at Lugou Bridge, he heard people discussing the State Council's call, turned his bicycle around, and returned to the mine. Production on the 31st was scheduled to begin at 10:00 PM, but he left his dormitory at 7:30 PM to go to the mine.
    This was the first production shift after the holiday. The workers on the last shift before the Spring Festival hadn't left any stored coal, so they couldn't start producing coal as soon as they arrived for work, as usual. The workers in the ninth tunneling group didn't wait for the team leader to arrive and began preparing for drilling half an hour early, at 9:30 PM. After arriving at the working face at 9:20 PM, Yan Fengming, the leader of the first mining team, organized the workers to quickly and safely complete the preparation work before coal extraction, such as loading explosives, blasting, and laying chutes, within 100 minutes, advancing the coal extraction time by half an hour.
    Despite the precious time and intense work, the miners were calm and collected. After arriving at the working face, they meticulously tapped the sides and checked the roof, inspecting the safety of the roof and coal ribs. Before and after blasting, the workers at the barricades strictly enforced the safety system of shouting warnings and clearing people.
    After 11:30 PM, the scene was more vibrant than a festive morning. The sounds of blasting from various working faces underground were louder and more continuous than firecrackers. The working faces echoed with the combined sounds of coal, metal, and wood. The rhythmic tapping of electric drills and the chopping of pit props by support workers created a moving labor symphony, endlessly praising those who work tirelessly for the prosperity of the motherland.
    The deputy mine manager, the Party branch secretary, and the heads of the trade union and the Youth League, as well as the deputy secretary of the Party committee from the Jingxi Mining Bureau, all went down the mine. They inspected the safe production conditions at each working face and congratulated the miners on their achievements in increasing production during the Spring Festival holiday. The miners had just finished drinking the white sugar water specially prepared by the mine during production breaks when the chairman of the trade union and dozens of surface cadres brought hot tea in thermos bottles.
    At 6:00 AM on February 1st, the dispatch room received phone reports from various working faces: the night shift workers had mined more than 453 tons of coal, exceeding the state's holiday production target by more than 80% and exceeding the mine's self-determined work plan by 12%.
    As the miners emerged from the mine entrance, the eastern sun was just rising. Warm water in the mine's bathhouse was already prepared, and food was being dished out in the cafeteria. The miners' families had also started their stoves and were cooking meals. Some housewives were even warming up a pot of baijiu, waiting for their loved ones who had worked hard all night.

### 矿井之夜

    矿井之夜	新华社记者　任家骥
    井口附近，路灯稀疏，听不见煤车奔驰的声音。这是京西煤矿假日里的通常景象。春节之夜却是紧张生产前的片刻寂静。
    城子矿的矿工们破例没有喝节日晚上的美酒，刚过八时就陆续来到井口。更衣室里灯火通明，人群川流不息。在这同时，回采、掘进等工段召开了春节中第一班生产前的准备会议。
    井口绞车马达响个不停，等候乘车下井的人越聚越多。十几个本该轮休的矿工怕有人缺勤也赶来了，可是每个小组都没有缺勤的人。回采工人关大宝，他在1月27日已动身回雄县老家探望父母，路经芦沟桥休息时，听到人们谈论国务院的号召，掉转自行车又回到矿上来。31日的生产是在晚十时开始，他七时半就从宿舍动身到矿上来。
    这是休假后第一班生产，春节前最后一班的工人没有留下存煤，不能像往常一样，一上班就能出煤。掘进九组的工人们没有等班长来到，在九时三十分提前半小时就做好了钻进的准备工作。回采一组的班长严凤明在九时二十分到达掌子面后，就组织工人在一百分钟内，快速、安全地完成了装炮、放炮和铺溜子等出煤前的准备工作，使出煤时间提前半小时。
    尽管时间宝贵，工作紧张，矿工们还是从容不迫，到达掌子面后，都先细致地敲帮问顶，检查顶板、煤帮的安全情况；在放炮前后，拦道口的工人严格地执行着喊话放人的安全制度。
    十一时半过后，这里比节日的早晨还富有春意，井下各个掌子面的炮声，比爆竹还宏亮，连续不绝。掌子面上是煤块、金属和木头混合的声音，嗒嗒发响的电钻，支柱工人的斧头有节奏地砍削坑木，大大小小的煤块离开铁锨后，顺着溜子滚滚而下，好似一组动人的劳动乐章，久久在歌颂为祖国繁荣而不倦工作的人们。
    副矿长、党总支书记和工会、青年团的负责人，以及从京西矿务局来的党委会副书记都下井来了。他们巡视各个掌子面的安全生产情况，向矿工们祝贺春节假日增产的成就。矿工们在生产间隙时间，刚喝完矿上特地准备的白糖开水，工会主席和几十个井上工作干部又送来了用热水瓶装的滚热的茶。
    2月1日早六时，调度室接到各掌子面电话汇报：夜班工人们采掘了四百五十三吨多煤，超过国家给予的假日增产数字80％多，比矿上自订的作业计划也多12％。
    矿工们走出井口时，东方太阳刚刚升起。井口浴室的温水早已备妥，食堂里饭菜正在出锅。矿工的家属也早已升炉做饭，有些主妇还烫了一壶白干，等待着已经紧张劳动一夜的亲人。
