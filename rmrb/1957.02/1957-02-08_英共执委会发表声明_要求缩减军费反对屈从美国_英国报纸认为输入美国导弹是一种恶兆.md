Xinhua News Agency, London, February 7th: TASS reported from London on February 6th: The Executive Committee of the Communist Party of Great Britain has issued a statement demanding an end to Britain's imperialist obligations abroad and an end to the "policy of subservience to the United States in order to achieve a substantial reduction in military spending."

The statement emphasized: "The Conservatives have jeopardized the future of British industry in order to cope with the huge expenditures on armaments and colonial wars in Cyprus, Kenya, and Malaya. They talk about reducing military spending, but they continue to pursue a policy of maintaining a large armed force and huge spending on nuclear weapons." The statement said that the current government refuses to implement a peaceful policy. "Its proposal to reduce military spending is only to seek American aid. Britain wants American aid, which means more dependence on the United States." The statement called on the British working people to actively participate in the struggle against the increase in unemployment and other economic difficulties, and to strive for parliamentary elections.

Xinhua News Agency, London, February 6th: British officials say that Sandys' visit to Washington is aimed at finding ways to cut defense costs. It is often complained here that Britain's annual defense expenditure of 1.5 billion pounds is an excessively heavy burden on the national economy.

The communique issued after the Washington talks mentioned that both sides "studied the possibility of Britain adopting certain American weapons." British newspapers revealed that these weapons would include intermediate-range ballistic missiles, etc.

However, while the import of atomic missiles from the United States is a good thing for some, it is a bad omen for others. The "New Statesman and Nation" weekly wrote: "The question that ordinary people and soldiers will now ask—because no one believes that Britain can withstand a world nuclear war, no matter where the nuclear weapons come from—is: Will Mr. Sandys' shopping trip to seek a limited strengthening of security increase the possibility of a world war, or will it reduce the possibility of a world war?"

The "News Chronicle" also pointed out that the United States may use British airports as bases for its missiles.

    英共执委会发表声明
    要求缩减军费反对屈从美国
    英国报纸认为输入美国导弹是一种恶兆
    新华社7日讯　据塔斯社伦敦6日讯：英国共产党执行委员会发表了一项声明，要求结束英国在国外担负的帝国主义性质的义务，结束“屈从美国的政策，以争取大大地缩减军备开支”。
    声明强调指出：“保守党人为了应付在军备上以及在塞浦路斯、怯尼亚、马来亚的殖民战争中的浩大开支而葬送了英国工业的前途。他们口头上在说缩减军费开支，但是还在继续奉行维持庞大武装部队和花在核子武器上的巨大开支的政策。”声明说，现政府拒绝实行和平政策，“它建议缩减军备上的开支，这只是为了争取美国的援助，英国要美国援助，也就是要更多地依赖美国。”声明号召英国劳动人民积极参加反对失业人数的增加和其他经济困难、争取举行议会选举的斗争。
    据新华社伦敦6日电　英官方说，桑迪斯访问华盛顿的目的是要设法削减防务费用。这里经常抱怨说，英国每年的十五亿英镑的防务开支对国民经济是过分沉重的负担。
    华盛顿会谈后所发表的公报中提到，双方“曾经研究了英国采用某些美国武器的可能性”。英国报纸透露说，这些武器将包括中级弹道导弹等等。
    但是，从美国输入原子导弹这件事对某些人说来，虽然是一件好事，对另外一些人却是一种恶兆。“新政治家与民族”周刊写道：“老百姓和军人现在将要提出的问题——因为没有人相信英国会经受得起世界核子战争，不管核子武器从何而来——是：究竟桑迪斯先生为了谋求有限地加强安全而作的办货旅行是会增加发生世界战争的可能性呢，还是会减少发生世界战争的可能性呢？”
    “新闻纪事报”也指出：美国可能利用英国机场作为它的导弹的基地。
