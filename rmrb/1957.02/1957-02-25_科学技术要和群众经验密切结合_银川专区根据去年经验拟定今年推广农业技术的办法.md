    Scientific Technology Must Be Closely Integrated with Mass Experience
    Yinchuan Special District Formulates Measures for Promoting Agricultural Technology This Year Based on Last Year's Experience
    (Our dispatch) Yinchuan Special District, Gansu Province, at the agricultural and animal husbandry technology conference held in mid-January, summarized the experiences and lessons learned in agricultural and animal husbandry production technology throughout the district last year, and formulated this year's production increase plan for the entire district, as well as the cultivation techniques for several major crops such as cotton, wheat, rice, and millet, and specific measures to promote these technologies.
    After Yinchuan Special District realized advanced cooperativization last spring, it also carried out tremendous reforms in agricultural and animal husbandry technology. Improved wheat varieties have been adopted throughout the district; over 90% of the wheat has been planted in rows with close spacing, and large-scale control of wheat midges has been carried out; the Jingzu 107 rice and Sizi 3173 cotton improved varieties have been widely promoted; more than 7,000 new agricultural implements have been promoted; in addition, there have been great improvements in the technical cultivation and fertilization of various crops compared to the past. However, due to some technical errors, coupled with natural disasters and other reasons, the production of some crops was reduced. In this situation, technical cadres were criticized and blamed, which frustrated their enthusiasm for work.
    The meeting believed that negative complaints and excessive accusations are of no benefit to the work, and we should actively learn from experience and lessons and improve our work. Therefore, it is required that party and government leaders at all levels and all rural work cadres attach importance to the technical reform of agricultural and animal husbandry production, strengthen leadership, strengthen support and cooperation in all aspects, and implement the "three combinations" of leadership, technology, and the masses. Party and government leading cadres at all levels must include technical work on the regular agenda, strive to learn technical knowledge, and pay attention to the training and improvement of technical personnel. When arranging production tasks, we must study how to grasp technical work and ensure the completion of production tasks from a technical point of view. All scientific and technical personnel must humbly listen to the experience of the masses; and educate the peasant masses to accept new scientific knowledge. At the same time, the experimental research work of science and technology must be combined with the production of the masses, and technical cadres should go deep into agricultural cooperatives, fields, and the production activities of the masses; it is necessary to turn the promotion of technology into a mass activity.

    科学技术要和群众经验密切结合
    银川专区根据去年经验拟定今年推广农业技术的办法
    本报讯　甘肃省银川专区在1月中旬召开的农牧业技术会议上，总结了去年全区农牧业生产技术上的经验教训，拟定了今年全区增产计划和棉花、小麦、水稻、糜子等几项主要作物的栽培技术和推广这些技术的具体措施。
    银川专区去年春天实现了高级合作化后，在农牧业技术上也进行了巨大的改革。小麦已在全区采用了良种；90％以上的小麦实行了条播密植，并大规模地进行了吸浆虫的防治工作；大面积地推广了京祖一零七水稻和斯字三一七三棉花良种；推广了各种新式农具七千余件；此外，在各种作物的技术栽培及施肥上也都比以前有很大改进。可是，由于技术上的一些错误，加上自然灾害等其他原因，使部分作物减了产。在这种情形下，技术干部受到了指责和埋怨，挫折了他们的工作积极性。
    会议认为消极的埋怨和过多的指责，对工作毫无好处，应该积极的吸取经验教训，改进工作。因此，要求各级党政领导和全体农村工作干部重视农牧业生产的技术改革工作，加强领导，加强各方面的支持和配合，实行领导、技术与群众的“三结合”。各级党政领导干部要把技术工作列入经常的议事日程，努力学习技术知识，注意技术力量的培养和提高。在布置生产任务时，要研究如何抓技术工作，从技术方面保证生产任务的完成。一切科学技术人员，必须虚心听取群众的经验；并教育农民群众接受新的科学知识。同时，科学技术的试验研究工作，必须与群众的生产相结合，技术干部应深入到农业社、田间及群众的生产活动中去；要把推广技术工作变成群众性的活动。
