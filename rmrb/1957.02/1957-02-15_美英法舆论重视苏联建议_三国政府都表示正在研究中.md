Xinhua News Agency, February 14th Dispatch: According to a TASS report on the 13th, Soviet Foreign Minister Shepilov's report at the Supreme Soviet meeting and the Soviet government's note to the three Western countries on the Middle East issue have been given importance by newspapers in the United States, Britain, and France.

    The "New York Times," "New York Herald Tribune," and "Daily News" indicate in their news reports and editorials that American officials are concerned that the "Soviet six-point plan for the Middle East" may lead to unfavorable actions by the US Congress regarding the government's Middle East proposals.

    According to newspaper reports, Senator Sparkman told reporters that the United States should not respond to the Soviet proposals with "indifference." Senator Russell, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said that if "the Russians sincerely suggest that all countries stop supplying weapons to the Near East, then this suggestion would be an outstanding contribution."

    The "Times" stated that the Soviet proposals on the Middle East "are bound to receive a favorable reaction from Middle Eastern countries," and "it is wrong to deny Mr. Shepilov's speech, simply thinking that his speech is an attempt to maintain goodwill with Arab nationalism. Any proposal aimed at promoting stability in the Middle East is worth studying very carefully, because this should be the constant goal of British policy." The "Daily Telegraph and Morning Post" was busy thinking that the Soviet proposals were "unacceptable." The "News Chronicle" said that "the Soviet peace offensive" should not be ignored, and "the West should always make unremitting efforts to achieve peaceful coexistence."

    Paris's "Le Monde" wrote that "Shepilov emphasized the necessity of peaceful coexistence more than once in his report," and "those parts of the report concerning East-West relations, disarmament, the Near East, and the possibility of convening a world economic conference also attract the attention of Western capitals." "Franc-Tireur" wrote that the claims made by the Soviet government in its note to the three Western countries are "very good," but the newspaper also demanded that the Soviet government show some "more specific actions" to prove its sincerity. "Libération" believes that the Soviet government's note is "a sign of moderation" and considers it a contribution to solving the Middle East problem.

    Xinhua News Agency, February 13th Dispatch: The governments of the United States, Britain, and France have all said that they are studying the new proposals on the Middle East issue put forward by the Soviet Union in its note to the three countries.

    US State Department spokesman White said on the 12th that the State Department had received the Soviet government's note on the Middle East issue and that the note is currently under study.

    Eisenhower exchanged views with Dulles on the Soviet proposals on the 12th via long-distance telephone. After the meeting, the White House press secretary issued a statement saying that the Soviet note was "a step to disparage or hinder the Eisenhower Plan in the Middle East."

    A British Foreign Office spokesman said on the same day that the British government was studying the note. He declined to comment on the Soviet note.

    A French Foreign Ministry spokesman said that the French government was studying the Soviet proposals "very carefully" and believed that the proposals should be given full consideration. He said that the Soviet Union's recent actions indicate that it wants to do everything possible to prevent another world crisis, especially in the Middle East. At the same time, he said that the Soviet proposals "do not contain anything specific."

    Xinhua News Agency, February 14th Dispatch: London News: A British Foreign Office spokesman said on the 13th that the United States, Britain, and France will consult before responding to the Soviet note on the Middle East issue. He predicted that the West would give a "conditional response."

    According to a report by the United Press, British officials believe that the West "certainly cannot afford to reject the Soviet proposals outright" because this would "offend the Arab countries." It is said that British officials also believe that the Soviet proposals are aimed at the "Eisenhower Doctrine," and therefore, the main responsibility for responding to these proposals will fall on Washington.

    美英法舆论重视苏联建议
    三国政府都表示正在研究中
    据新华社14日讯　据塔斯社13日消息：苏联外交部长谢皮洛夫在最高苏维埃会议上的报告和苏联政府关于中东问题给西方三国的照会，受到美、英、法三国报纸的重视。
    “纽约时报”、“纽约先驱论坛报”和“每日新闻”在它们的消息和社论里表明，美国官方人士担忧“苏联对中东的六点计划”可能使得美国国会对政府中东建议作出不利的举动。
    据报纸报道，参议员斯巴克曼对记者说，美国不应该对苏联的建议表示“冷淡”。参议院军事委员会主席鲁塞尔说，如果“俄国人真正善意地建议各国停止将武器供给近东，那末，这项建议将是一个突出的贡献”。
    “泰晤士报”说，苏联关于中东的建议“想必会得到中东国家的良好反应”，“否定谢皮洛夫先生的演说，简单地认为他的演说是对阿拉伯民族主义保持好感的企图，那是错误的。旨在促进中东稳定的任何建议都是值得十分仔细地研究的，因为这正应当是英国政策的不变目标。”“每日电讯与晨邮报”忙着认为苏联的建议是“不能接受的”。“新闻纪事报”说，“苏联的和平攻势”不应当加以忽视，“西方应当始终不懈地采取一切办法来实现和平共处”。
    巴黎“新闻报”写道，“谢皮洛夫在报告中不止一次地强调和平共处的必要性”，“报告中关于东西方关系、裁军、近东以及召开世界经济会议的可能性的那些部分也吸引西方首都的注意。”“义勇军报”写道，苏联政府在给西方三国的照会中所提出的主张是“很好的”，但是，报纸又要求苏联政府方面表现出某种“更加具体的行动”来证明它的诚意。“解放报”认为，苏联政府的照会是“和缓的征兆”，并且认为是对解决近东问题的贡献。
    新华社13日讯　美、英、法三国政府都说，它们在研究苏联给三国照会里提出的关于中东问题的新建议。
    美国国务院发言人怀特12日说，国务院已经接到了苏联政府关于中东问题的照会，对这个照会目前正在研究中。
    艾森豪威尔在12日通过长途电话同杜勒斯会谈，就苏联的建议交换意见。在会谈后，白宫新闻秘书发表声明说，苏联照会是“一个企图诋毁，或者阻止在中东的艾森豪威尔计划的步骤”。
    英国外交部发言人同一天说，英国政府在研究这个照会。他拒绝就苏联的照会发表意见。
    法国外交部发言人说，法国政府正在“非常仔细地”研究苏联的建议，而且认为应该充分考虑这个建议。他说，苏联最近的行动表明它想尽其所能来制止另一次世界危机，尤其是在中东。同时，他又说，苏联建议“没有包含任何具体的东西”。
    新华社14日讯　伦敦消息：英国外交部发言人13日说，美英法三大国在答复苏联的关于中东问题的照会以前将进行商谈。他预料，西方将给以“有条件的答复”。
    据合众社报道，英国官方人士认为，西方“肯定经不起断然拒绝苏联的建议”，因为这会“触犯阿拉伯国家”。据说，英国官方还认为，苏联的建议是针对“艾森豪威尔主义”的，因此，西方答复这些建议的主要责任将在华盛顿身上。
