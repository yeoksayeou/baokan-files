	Advanced Timber Supplier
	Timber supplier Tian Fenggui, in the past three months, has saved more than 6,500 cubic meters of good timber by utilizing inexpensive wood. On the 9th, he was named an advanced worker by the trade union of the Anshan Metallurgical Construction General Company.
	"Not letting a single piece of wood be wasted" is Tian Fenggui's rule for supplying timber. However, some construction units prefer to use high-quality wood regardless of the project. Therefore, whenever materials are issued, he asks in detail what project they are for, and often goes to the construction site to check for any instances of using large materials for small purposes. Once, the Rolling Mill Engineering Company wanted to requisition 500 cubic meters of high-quality wood for house frames. Based on his more than ten years of experience as a carpenter, Tian Fenggui believed that inexpensive wood would suffice for that type of project. The requisition clerk objected, saying, "The design drawings stipulate the use of high-quality materials." Tian Fenggui then led the requisition clerk to the warehouse to look at the wood and used concrete examples to show that with a little processing, it would not affect the project quality at all. The requisition clerk finally happily accepted the inexpensive wood and soon after specifically thanked Tian Fenggui for helping their construction site complete the task of reducing costs.
	Tian Fenggui is skilled at reviving scrap materials. Last year, when a company moved, they discarded more than 1,000 cubic meters of scrap materials, most of which were broken small cart frames, short scaffolding poles, and other messy items. He went to sort them out and store them. By the end of the year, the Changdianpu simple housing project could not start because of a lack of wood. After Tian Fenggui learned about this, he found the construction department of this housing project and suggested using the scrap materials. As a result, they were processed into very good wooden structural frames, and the houses were quickly built. (Xinhua News Agency)

    先进的木材供应员
    木材供应员田凤贵，在过去三个月中利用廉价木材，节约了六千五百多立方公尺好木材。9日，他被鞍山冶金建筑总公司机关工会评为先进工作者。
    “不让一块木头屈材”是田凤贵供应木材的守则。但是有些建筑单位不管什么工程，都喜欢领用上等木材，因此每逢发料的时候，他都详细地问清什么工程上使用，还常常跑到工地上查看有没有大材小用的现象。有一次，轧钢工程公司要领五百立方公尺上等木材作房架，田凤贵根据自己作木工十多年的经验，认为那种工程用廉价木材就行，领料员反对说：“设计图上规定要用好料。”田凤贵就带领料员到仓库看了看木材，并且用具体事例说明只要稍加加工，一点不影响工程质量。领料员终于欣然接受了廉价木料，不久还特向田凤贵道谢帮助他们工地完成了降低成本的任务。
    田凤贵是让残料复活的能手。去年一个公司搬家，扔下了一千多立方公尺残料，其中大部分是破小车架子，短脚手杆等杂乱不堪的东西，他就前去整理一番，保管起来。到年底的时候，长甸铺简易住宅工程因为没有木料，不能开工。田凤贵知道以后，找到这个住宅的建筑部门，建议用残料。结果加工成了很好的木结构架，房子很快盖起来了。　　　　　（新华社）
