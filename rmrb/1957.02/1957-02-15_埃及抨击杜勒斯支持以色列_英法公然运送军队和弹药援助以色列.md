Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, February 14th: Egyptian Intelligence Director Hatem issued a statement targeting US Secretary of State Dulles' plan to support Israel, saying that certain countries are supporting Israel to reap benefits from its war of aggression against Egypt launched together with Britain and France.

According to Western news agencies, Dulles presented his plan during a meeting with Israeli Ambassador to the United States Eban on February 11th. According to this plan: First, the United States will publicly announce its support for free navigation in the Gulf of Aqaba, which Egypt has previously considered closed to Israeli ships because its state of war with Israel has not ended. Second, the United States will advocate for a large number of UN troops or UN observers to be stationed in the Gaza Strip.

Hatem's statement said that the Egyptian government believes that countries supporting Israel's demands and striving for their realization are attacking the rights of Palestinian Arabs and violating the United Nations Charter.

He said that the purpose of these countries is obviously to help Israel achieve its political goals through its aggression against Egypt in cooperation with Britain and France. On the Israeli side, it is relying on the support of these countries, hoping that the Palestinian Arabs will forever lose their rights, which is also what the imperialist countries hope for.

All Egyptian newspapers on the 13th fiercely criticized Dulles' plan. "Al-Gomhuria" published an editorial signed by its editor-in-chief, Sadat, saying that the United States "can happily offer whatever guarantees and promises it wants, but it should remember that these guarantees should not affect the independence and sovereignty of other countries."

Sadat wrote that the United States should first try to force Israel to obey the UN's demand for it to withdraw its troops, rather than propose a compromise "aimed at rewarding Israel's aggression." Nor should it do so on Arab territory. Gaza and Sharm el-Sheikh belong to the Arabs.

Xinhua News Agency, February 14th: TASS, Damascus, February 13th: According to "Al-Tahrir," two British ships and one Italian ship carrying British and French troops, ammunition, weapons, and military supplies to Israel arrived at the Israeli port of Haifa on February 11th.

### 埃及抨击杜勒斯支持以色列  英法公然运送军队和弹药援助以色列

    埃及抨击杜勒斯支持以色列
    英法公然运送军队和弹药援助以色列
    据新华社开罗14日电　埃及情报司司长哈特姆发表的一篇针对美国国务卿杜勒斯支持以色列的计划的声明说，某些国家正在支持以色列从它同英法一起发动的侵埃战争中得到好处。
    据西方通讯社报道，杜勒斯2月11日在同以色列驻美国大使伊班会谈时曾经提出他的计划。根据这个计划，一、美国将公开宣布支持亚喀巴湾的自由通航，而过去埃及一直认为它同以色列的战争状态没有结束，因而禁止以色列船只通过。二、美国将主张大量的联合国部队或联合国观察员驻扎在加沙地带。
    哈特姆的声明说，埃及政府认为支持以色列的要求并为它的实现而努力的国家是在进攻巴勒斯坦阿拉伯人的权利和违犯联合国宪章。
    他说，这些国家的目的显然是为了以色列同英法合作侵略埃及而替以色列实现它的政治目的。在以色列方面，它正依靠这些国家的支持，希望巴勒斯坦的阿拉伯人永远丧失他们的权利，这也是帝国主义国家所希望的。
    埃及各报在13日都激烈指责杜勒斯的计划。“共和国报”发表的由它的主编萨达特署名的一篇社论说，美国“可以高兴提出什么样的保证和诺言就提出什么样的保证和诺言，但是它应当记住，这些保证不应当影响其他国家的独立和主权”。
    萨达特写道，美国本应当首先设法强迫以色列服从联合国要它撤军的要求，而不是提出一个“目的在于奖励以色列侵略的”妥协办法。也不应当在阿拉伯领土上这样做。加沙和沙姆沙伊赫是属于阿拉伯人的。
    新华社14日讯　塔斯社大马士革13日讯：据“解放报”报道，往以色列运送英法军队以及弹药武器和军需品的两艘英国轮船和一艘意大利轮船2月11日驶抵以色列海法港。
