Xinhua News Agency, Shigatse, February 4th. Various organizations, groups, and the broad masses in Shigatse have warmly welcomed the Panchen Erdeni in recent days.

On the afternoon of February 3rd, the Shigatse Sub-Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Shigatse Basic-Level Office, and the Panchen Kampus Assembly Hall Committee jointly held a banquet at the Lazang Zegong Palace in Tashilhunpo Monastery to welcome the Panchen Erdeni. At the banquet, Liang Xuanxian, Secretary of the Shigatse Sub-Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, raised his glass to wish the Panchen Erdeni good health. Also attending the banquet were Zhan Dong·Ji Jinmei, Director of the Panchen Kampus Assembly Hall Committee, Enjiu Living Buddha, the Panchen's tutor, and the Panchen's father and mother.

On February 2nd, officials from the Panchen Kampus Assembly Hall Committee and more than four thousand monks from Tashilhunpo Monastery held a grand religious welcome ceremony called "Gaduo" for the Panchen Erdeni in the Lazang Sutra Hall of Tashilhunpo Monastery.

At noon that day, the Panchen Erdeni ascended to the throne amidst the sounds of Buddhist horns. The Grand Lama Tuden Nima first presented the "Mandala," symbolizing the universe, to the Panchen Erdeni amidst rising incense smoke. Following this, more than two hundred officials from the Panchen Kampus Assembly Hall Committee lined up and paid homage in turn, presenting hadas (ceremonial scarves). The Panchen Erdeni blessed each of them by touching their heads. After the officials finished paying homage, lamas from Tashilhunpo Monastery and devout Buddhist citizens eagerly paid their respects to the Panchen Erdeni. Many of them offered "Shizi" (tower-shaped objects made of ghee), symbolizing wishes for the Buddha's long life. The Panchen Erdeni gave them red cloth strips and food, symbolizing auspiciousness and happiness. Responsible comrades from various departments of the Shigatse Sub-Committee of the Chinese Communist Party were also invited to participate in the welcome ceremony.

On February 1st, the first day after the Panchen's return, lamas from temples in more than ten "溪卡" (administrative divisions under monasteries) near Shigatse, along with more than 1,500 farmers and herdsmen, gathered in the square of Tashilhunpo Monastery to joyfully sing and dance to welcome the Panchen Erdeni's return. Many of them also brought rich pastries and highland barley wine. On this day, the people were all dressed beautifully. The women wore arched head ornaments inlaid with agate and coral, which they only wear during festivals, and they danced gracefully to the music of the six-stringed lute. It was not until the sun set that the people dispersed, reluctant to leave.
