The spring planting season is approaching. Agricultural production cooperatives in various regions are formulating or revising their production plans and arranging planting work. This is the most important step in striving for a bumper harvest this year.

One important lesson from leading large-scale production last year is the need for active and fully reliable production plans. Although some agricultural cooperatives' production plans had problems such as excessively high targets and too many restrictions, production plans undoubtedly played a significant role in the overall increase in production. Therefore, correctly summarizing last year's planning experience, affirming what should be affirmed, and correcting what should be corrected, to make this year's production plans even better, is of great significance for this year's agricultural increase.

Judging from the current situation of production plan formulation in various regions, most areas have made up for last year's shortcomings, making the plans more reasonable and realistic. However, some agricultural cooperatives, when formulating this year's production plans and arranging crop planting areas, did not correctly accept last year's experience and lessons. What should have been affirmed was not, and what should not have been opposed was opposed, so that this year's production plans are somewhat low in many places. Therefore, some members of agricultural cooperatives said: "Last year, it was difficult to achieve even if you were exhausted, this year, you can achieve it while sleeping." For example, Ding County, Hebei Province, suffered a disaster last year, with the actual output of the county being about 250 million catties, while this year's preliminary plan output is still 250 million catties, which is essentially a production reduction plan. Similar situations exist in other regions as well. In addition, there are new problems in the arrangement of crop planting areas. Jinxing Agricultural Cooperative in Liaoyang County, Liaoning Province, planted more corn when promoting high-yield crops last year, and this year some people advocate not planting any at all. Some agricultural cooperatives, hearing that they should promote independent management, do not consider the needs of the state and emphasize "plant whatever you want." This newly sprouting deviation is harmful to striving for a bumper harvest this year.

Advanced and reliable plans can point out the direction and goals for people, propose ways and correct measures to achieve these goals, and promote agricultural cooperatives to explore all potential and do everything possible to strive for increased production. Low plans will cause agricultural cooperatives to relax their due efforts, slacken the members, and make the objective conditions and potential for increased production that clearly exist not be utilized and developed, and make the indicators that could have been achieved unable to become a reality. Some comrades say: Last year's targets were too high, and we committed subjectivism, this year we must lower them. They do not understand that indicators that are lower than realistic possibilities are also committing the mistake of being divorced from reality and subjectivism.

Correct plans are formulated by correctly analyzing subjective and objective conditions. If some agricultural cooperatives' plan targets were too high last year, it was mainly due to overestimating the favorable conditions, then this year some agricultural cooperatives' plan targets are too low, but it is the result of overestimating the difficult conditions. It should be seen that after a year of large-scale production last year, cadres and the masses have accumulated rich experience, the organization of agricultural cooperatives has become more consolidated, and capital accumulation has increased, all of which have prepared better conditions for further increase in production this year, but some comrades only see some superficial difficulties and say that the potential has been exhausted and there is no possibility of increasing production this year, so they dare not propose active increase in production targets. This ideological emotion, which lags behind the objective reality and the demands of the masses, is the main obstacle to striving for increased production this year and must be resolutely eliminated.

An important issue in production plans is the rational arrangement of planting areas. In addition to adapting to local natural conditions, it is also necessary to correctly combine the requirements of the state, agricultural cooperatives, and members. The main problem in this regard last year was the one-sided emphasis on state requirements, simply allocating planting plans from top to bottom, not giving agricultural cooperatives room for maneuver, and affecting the livelihood needs of members. For example, the excessive promotion of high-yield crops squeezed out some of the minor grains that people were accustomed to eating, and did not pay attention to planting necessary feed crops, resulting in insufficient feed and fodder. In some southern provinces, there was a one-sided emphasis on food crops, ignoring the economic crops that farmers were accustomed to planting. In some places, even the chili peppers that farmers were accustomed to eating had no place to plant. This year's planning work must correct these shortcomings and must change the practice of rigidly allocating planting areas, which is very important. But on the other hand, in the new situation of increased management independence of agricultural cooperatives, when arranging crop planting, they should still first consider the needs of the state, and should take care of the specific requirements of the members under the premise of ensuring the completion of the state plan. The vast grain-producing areas of the country should focus on developing grain production, and at the same time develop a variety of economies, and cannot neglect either. Last year, some places emphasized the increase in grain and cotton production, which was correct; however, neglecting the development of a variety of economies was not correct. When correcting this deviation this year, be sure not to deviate to the other side. When Panyu County, Guangdong Province, formulated this year's production plan, some agricultural cooperatives had a tendency to blindly reduce the rice planting area and expand the planting area of arrowhead and water chestnut, but later they mobilized the masses to discuss it and reversed it. All localities should pay attention to this issue.

In places where there was too much promotion of high-yield crops last year, it is necessary to appropriately control the planting area of high-yield crops this year and sow some minor grains and other crops that meet the needs of the members, which is necessary. But it must also be done with caution and reasonable adjustment. The Laiyang County Committee of Shandong Province originally planned to greatly reduce the planting area of sweet potatoes, but the members disagreed, worrying that there would not be enough food to eat, and requested "eat enough first, then eat well." This shows that the masses understand the benefits of promoting high-yield crops. Therefore, when arranging the planting area this year, be sure to listen to the opinions of the masses, and do not hear a little reaction from a few people and then massively reduce the planting area of high-yield crops without consideration.

In addition, areas with conditions to promote some high-yield crops should still persuade farmers to appropriately promote high-yield crops.

Many experiences have proved that the process of formulating agricultural production plans is a process of mobilizing and educating the masses. To make the plan reasonable, the arrangement appropriate, meeting the needs of the state and taking care of the members, and the indicators neither too high nor too low, the best way is to follow the mass line, consult with the masses more, and listen to the opinions of the members more. In this way, on the one hand, it can prevent subjectivism on the part of the leadership and make the plan realistic, and at the same time it can give play to the enthusiasm of the members, encourage them to find ways to increase production in many ways, and make the implementation of the plan more guaranteed. Many places have achieved successful experience in this regard and should be summarized and promoted.

After the recent period of extensive mobilization, the enthusiasm of the vast number of farmers for increased production has generally risen, and they are full of confidence in striving for a bumper harvest this year. All rural workers should cherish the enthusiasm of the masses, arrange the spring and annual production plans responsibly in accordance with the requirements of the state and use last year's experience, and lead the vast number of farmers to march toward nature and strive for a comprehensive upsurge in agricultural production and rural economy in 1957.

### 春播计划要又先进又可靠

    春播计划要又先进又可靠
    春播季节快到了。各地农业生产合作社正在制订或修订生产计划，安排播种工作。这是争取今年农业大丰收的最重要的一步。
    去年领导大生产中的一条重要经验，是要有积极而又充分可靠的生产计划。尽管有些农业合作社的生产计划曾经发生一些指标过高、限制过多之类的毛病，但是总的来说，生产计划无疑对整个增产运动发生了巨大作用。因此，正确地总结去年计划工作的经验，把应当肯定的肯定下来，应当改正的加以改正，使今年的生产计划订得更好，这对于今年农业的增产是有重大意义的。
    从目前各地制订生产计划的情况来看，大部分地区都弥补了去年的缺点，使计划订得更加合理、更加切合实际了。但是，也有一部分农业社在制订今年生产计划、安排作物播种面积的时候，没有正确接受去年的经验教训，应该肯定的没有肯定下来，不应该反对的也给反对掉了，以致许多地方今年的生产计划又有些偏低。因此，有些农业社的社员说：“去年是累死也难实现，今年是睡大觉也能达到。”例如，河北定县去年遭灾，全县实产量约为二亿五千万斤，而今年初步计划产量仍为二亿五千万斤，这实质上是一个减产计划。类似的情形，其他地区也有。另外，在作物播种面积的安排上，也有新的问题发生。辽宁省辽阳县金星农业社去年推广高产作物的时候，多种了一些玉米，今年就有人主张一亩也不要种了。有些农业社听说要提倡经营的独立性，就不考虑国家需要，强调“想种啥就种啥”。这种新萌芽的偏差，对于争取今年的大丰收是有害的。
    先进而可靠的计划，可以给人指出前进的方向和目标，提出达到这个目标的途径和正确的措施，促使农业合作社发掘一切潜力，尽一切可能来争取增产。偏低的计划，会使农业合作社放松应有的努力，使社员松劲，使客观上明明存在着的增产条件和潜力得不到利用和发挥，使本来可能达到的指标不能变为现实。有些同志说：去年指标太高，犯了主观主义，今年可要低些。他们不懂得那种低于现实可能性的指标，同样是犯了脱离实际的、主观主义的毛病。
    正确的计划，是正确分析了主观和客观的条件而制订出来的。如果说去年有些农业社的计划指标过高，主要是由于过多估计了有利条件，那么今年某些农业社的计划指标过低，却是过多估计了困难条件的结果。应该看到，经过去年一年的大生产，干部和群众都积累了丰富的经验，农业社的组织也更加巩固了，资金积累也多了，这些都给今年进一步增产准备了更好的条件，而有些同志却只看到一些表面的困难，就说潜力挖光了，今年没有可能再提高生产了，因而不敢再提出积极的增产指标。这种落后于客观实际和群众要求的思想情绪，是争取今年增产的主要障碍，必须坚决加以消除。
    生产计划中的一个重要问题，是播种面积的合理安排。除了要因地制宜、适应当地自然条件以外，还要把国家、农业合作社、社员三方面的要求正确地结合起来。去年在这个问题上的主要毛病，是片面强调国家要求，单纯自上而下地分配种植计划，不给农业合作社以机动的余地，影响了社员的生活需要。比如，过多地推广高产作物，以致挤掉了一部分人们习惯吃用的小杂粮，也没有注意种植必要的饲料作物，以致饲料饲草不足。在南方有些省份单纯强调粮食作物，忽视了农民习惯种植的经济作物。有些地方，连农民习惯吃用的辣椒也弄得没有地方种了。今年的计划工作必须纠正这些缺点，必须改变硬性分配种植面积的作法，这是非常重要的。但在另一方面，农业合作社在经营独立性增大的新情况下，安排作物种植的时候，还是首先应当考虑到国家的需要，应当在保证完成国家计划的前提下照顾社员们的具体要求。全国广大的产粮区都应该以发展粮食生产为主，同时发展多种经济，不能偏废。去年有些地方强调了粮棉增产，这是对的；但是，忽视了多种经济的发展，就不对了。今年在纠正这一偏向的时候，千万不要又偏到另一面去。广东番禺县制订今年生产计划的时候，有些农业社曾经发生盲目缩小稻谷面积，扩大慈姑、荸荠等种植面积的偏向，后来发动群众讨论，才扭转过来。各地都应当注意这个问题。
    去年推广高产作物过多的地方，今年要适当地控制高产作物的种植面积，播种一些适合社员需要的小杂粮等作物，是必要的。但也必须慎重从事，合理调整。山东省莱阳县委原来打算大大地压缩甘薯的种植面积，社员们不同意，耽心粮食不够吃，要求“先吃饱，再吃好。”这说明群众是懂得推广高产作物的好处的。因此，今年在安排种植面积的时候，一定要多听听群众的意见，不要听到几个人的一点反映，就不加考虑地大量压缩高产作物的种植面积。
    另外，有条件推广一些高产作物的地区，仍然要说服农民适当地推广高产作物。
    许多经验证明，农业生产计划制订的过程，就是一个发动和教育群众的过程。要做到计划合理，安排得当，既满足国家需要，又照顾社员群众，指标既不过高，也不过低，最好的办法就是走群众路线，多跟群众商量，多多听取社员群众的意见。这样，一方面可以防止领导上的主观主义，使计划切合实际，同时又能发挥社员群众的积极性，鼓舞他们多方寻找增产门路，使计划的实现更有保证。不少地方在这一方面已经取得了成功的经验，应当加以总结和发扬。
    经过最近时期的广泛动员，广大农民的增产热情普遍高涨，对争取今年的大丰收充满信心。所有的农村工作同志们，都应该珍贵群众的热情，根据国家的要求，运用去年的经验，认真负责地安排好春季的和全年的生产计划，率领广大农民向大自然进军，争取1957年农业生产和农村经济的全面高涨。
