　　Steel and timber are invaluable materials indispensable to national construction. With the rapid development of national construction, the demand for steel and timber is increasingly outstripping supply. To resolve this contradiction, the only solutions are to increase production and conserve. Increasing the production of one ton of steel is no easy task: from ore to iron to steel to steel products, it must go through countless complex technical processes, and it takes the blood and sweat of countless people. However, wasting one ton of steel is not difficult at all. If some people are even a little extravagant, the amount wasted would be more than just one ton, but dozens or even hundreds of tons. Wei Qingyu, the "expert in conserving steel," clearly recognized this point, so he made a great contribution to the country by saving raw materials. The personnel of the Genhe Forestry Bureau in Inner Mongolia lacked this perspective, resulting in serious waste. From this, we can see that to do a good job in increasing production and conserving resources, we must not only have a high degree of responsibility towards national property, but also have a correct attitude towards the fruits of labor of millions of people. We must know that not a single bit of material comes easily!

    当思来处不易
    钢材、木材都是国家建设中不可缺少的宝贵物资。随着国家建设的迅速发展，钢材、木材愈来愈显得供不应求。要解决这个矛盾，只有增产和节约。要增产一吨钢材，并不是轻而易举的事：从矿石到铁到钢到钢材，不知要经过多少复杂的技术过程，不知要花费多少人的血和汗。可是，要浪费一吨钢材却并不难，只要某些人大手大脚一点，浪费的数目就不只一吨，而是几十吨几百吨。“节约钢材的能手”魏庆余，明确地意识到这一点，所以他为国家节约原材料作出了很大的贡献。内蒙古根河森工局的人员缺乏这个观点，造成了严重的浪费。我们从这里可以看到：要做好增产节约工作，不仅对国家资财要具有高度的责任感，而且对千百万人的劳动成果要有正确的态度。须知一点一滴的物资，都不是轻易得来的呀！
