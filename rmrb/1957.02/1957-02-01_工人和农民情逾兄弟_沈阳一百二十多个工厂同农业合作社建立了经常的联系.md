Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 30th – Workers and peasants in Shenyang City have formed a solid and close alliance through mutual visits and assistance. By the end of January this year, more than 120 factories in the 14 industrial systems of Shenyang, including heavy industry, machinery industry and textile industry, had established guidance relationships with agricultural production cooperatives. Shenyang May 3rd Factory, Shenyang Mining Machinery Factory, Shenyang Water Pump Factory, and others have also signed mutual aid contracts with agricultural production cooperatives.

According to incomplete statistics from 26 factories in the First Machine Industry system, last year they organized 819 employee representatives to visit agricultural production cooperatives for 217 visits and guidance activities. More than 4,100 representatives from agricultural production cooperatives came to the factories for visits and tours. Xin'nong Agricultural Production Cooperative in Shenyang County was an advanced cooperative established during the high tide of agricultural cooperation last year. Some members did not have sufficient understanding of agricultural production cooperatives and lacked confidence in increasing production. The Shenyang May 3rd Factory Committee of the Chinese Communist Party sent a reporter to give the members reports on the First Five-Year Plan and the superiority of cooperation, which greatly stimulated the members' production enthusiasm and initiative. When weeds and seedlings grew vigorously in the fields of this cooperative, and there was a shortage of labor, more than 200 workers from the May 3rd Factory used their spare time for voluntary labor, helping them to weed and catch insects, and helped the agricultural cooperative dig three earthen wells to irrigate the paddy fields, enabling the cooperative to achieve a bumper harvest. Shenyang Agricultural Machinery Factory, Shenyang Bicycle Factory, Shenyang Electrical Machinery Factory and other factories have helped agricultural production cooperatives improve farming techniques and increase yield per unit area.

Through guidance activities, various factories have also helped farmers improve and enliven their cultural and recreational lives. Shenyang Mining Machinery Factory and Shenyang Second Machine Tool Factory have donated many books to agricultural production cooperatives and helped establish libraries and book borrowing systems. Literary and art workers from Shenyang Trolleybus Company have adapted the deeds of advanced agricultural producers into literary and art programs for the farmers to perform. Many factories are also preparing to perform literary and art programs reflecting rural production and life, such as "Rural Morning" and "Mother and Daughter", for farmers during gatherings.

Agricultural production cooperatives in various places have also taken the initiative to do a lot of work in strengthening the unity of members and workers. In the past year, 134 batches of farmers have visited and toured various factories. From the production processes of smelting and machinery manufacturing departments, they learned about the role and hardship of workers in the production process, which further increased their brotherly affection for the workers. After visiting the Shenyang Farm Implement Factory, Jin Xing Agricultural Production Cooperative in Masanjiazi Township, Shenyang County, saw that new products need to be constantly tested to be successful. Therefore, they allocated a piece of land in the cooperative that was temporarily not in use to the Shenyang Farm Implement Factory as a "testing ground", helping the factory complete the trial production of two new types of agricultural machinery.

Currently, more than 100 factories in Shenyang City have organized worker representative teams to go to the countryside to have gatherings and visits with farmers in early February.

    工人和农民情逾兄弟
    沈阳一百二十多个工厂同农业合作社建立了经常的联系
    新华社沈阳30日电　沈阳市工人和农民通过互相访问、互相帮助、已结成了巩固和亲密的联盟。到今年1月末，沈阳市重工业、机械工业和纺织工业等十四个产业系统中，已有一百二十多个工厂与农业生产合作社建立了辅导关系。沈阳五三工厂、沈阳矿山机器厂、沈阳水泵厂等并与农业生产合作社签订了互助合同。
    据第一机械工业系统的二十六个工厂不完全统计，去年一年中，组织了八百一十九名职工代表到农业生产合作社去，进行了二百一十七次访问和辅导活动；农业生产合作社有四千一百多名代表到工厂来进行了参观和访问。沈阳县新农农业生产合作社是去年全国农业合作化高潮时成立的高级社，有部分社员对农业生产合作社认识不足，增产信心不高，中共沈阳五三工厂委员会派出报告员，给社员们做了第一个五年计划和合作化的优越性的报告，大大激发了社员们的生产热情和积极性。当这个社地里草苗齐长，劳动力不足的时候，五三工厂有二百多名工人利用业余时间进行义务劳动，帮助他们除草、捉虫，并且帮助农业社打了三口土井灌溉稻田，使这个社获得了丰收。沈阳农业机械厂、沈阳自行车厂、沈阳电工机械厂等工厂都帮助农业生产合作社改进了耕作技术，提高了单位面积产量。
    各个工厂通过辅导活动，也帮助农民改善和活跃了文化娱乐生活。沈阳矿山机器厂、沈阳第二机床厂，赠送给农业生产合作社很多书籍，并帮助建立了图书馆和借阅书籍的制度，沈阳市电车公司文艺工作者，根据农业先进生产者的事迹编成文艺节目给农民演出。许多工厂还准备在联欢时给农民演出反映农村生产和生活的文艺节目，如“乡村早晨”和“母女俩”等。
    各地农业生产合作社也主动地在加强社员和工人的团结方面做了许多工作。在过去的一年里，有一百三十四批农民到各个工厂进行了访问和参观。他们从冶炼、机械制造部门的生产过程中，了解了工人在生产过程中的作用和艰苦，使他们对工人更进一步增加了兄弟般的感情。沈阳县马三家子乡金星农业生产合作社到沈阳农具厂参观后，看到新产品需要不断地试验才能成功，于是就把社里一块暂时用不着的地，拨给沈阳农具厂做“试验场”，帮助这个工厂完成了两种新式农业机械的试制工作。
    目前，沈阳市有一百多个工厂已组织了工人代表队，将在2月初到农村和农民联欢并进行访问。
