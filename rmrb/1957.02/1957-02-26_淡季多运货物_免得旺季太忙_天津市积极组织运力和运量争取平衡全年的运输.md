Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, February 25th. Xinhua News Agency reporter Yin Chongjing reports: At a time when basic construction tasks have not yet been determined, commerce has entered the off-season, and transportation appears relatively quiet, transportation departments and relevant units in the Tianjin area are taking measures to vigorously strive to transport as many goods as possible, in order to reduce congestion and tension in future transportation.

    The person in charge of the Tianjin transportation department believes that this is an important lesson learned from last year. Last year, the volume of freight transportation in the Tianjin area in the first quarter was very small, especially for basic construction materials. From the second quarter to the end of the year, the overall transportation work was completed in a tense, busy, and passive manner. At the beginning of this year, similar signs have become apparent again. The total volume of domestic coastal commodities handled by the Tianjin Port Authority in February will be 45% less than the highest level in October last year; all night transport vehicles of the Tianjin Municipal Automobile Transportation Company have been suspended, and about 100 vehicles of transportation capacity will still be idle during the day; thousands of horse-drawn carts in the city can only work for half a day each day. The railway transportation situation is relatively better, but in the Tianjin Railway Bureau's jurisdiction, the volume of goods dispatched in February this year is also 100 wagons less per day than in the most tense month of November last year.

    In view of this situation, and anticipating that the total transportation volume of commodities and basic construction materials, etc., will not be less than last year, and that the overall transportation task will still be quite tight, the Tianjin Municipal People's Committee and various transportation departments took various measures early to organize transportation capacity and volume and strive to balance the transportation throughout the year. The Tianjin Railway Bureau originally planned to transport 4,263 wagons of building materials such as sand, stone, bricks, and lime in February. By February 20, the task had been overfulfilled. Now it has begun to gradually resume the transportation of ten trains of sand and stone, and more than 10 million bricks and tiles and other basic construction materials that had been reduced some time ago due to busy passenger transport. Railway workers have put forward the slogan of "transporting one more wagon if possible," and vigorously organize over-planned transportation. After a large amount of basic construction materials arrived in Tianjin, the Tianjin Municipal Materials Supply Department, in addition to uniformly storing a portion, has pre-allocated them to construction sites with concentrated construction projects and a high probability of approval. Tens of thousands of cubic meters of yellow soil for construction stored in the suburbs of the city and more than 20 million bricks left on the kiln site have also begun to be transported to construction sites in advance in February. The overall plan is to reserve 20% to 25% of the materials needed for the whole year before construction starts.

    State-owned commercial departments in Tianjin are also trying their best to lower the supply of goods ahead of schedule. The textile and knitwear purchasing and supply station has advanced the allocation of spring and summer goods included in the March supply plan to February, including 1 million meters of printed cloth and colored cloth, and 100,000 dozens of undershirts and vests. The department store and cultural goods purchasing and supply station have also advanced the allocation of paper, soap, sneakers, enamel products, and other items to various places.

    In addition, various transportation departments have also taken many measures to strive for more and earlier transportation at the beginning of the year. In more than a month, the Tianjin Port Authority has dispatched personnel to local and other places to strive for more than 10,000 tons of coal, hardware, groceries and other sources of goods outside the plan, preparing to transport them to Shanghai. The 21 business offices of the Tianjin Transportation Company distributed throughout the city have fully mobilized to undertake a large number of goods. The Hongqiao District Office visited 110 industrial and commercial units, and 49 households entrusted 1,000 tons of goods for transportation. The Haihe River, with rolling ice floes, usually does not open until the spring warmth. This year, starting from February 21, the inland waterway transportation department launched ten large wooden sailboats to transport through the ice; other rivers such as the Ziya River and the Nanyun River will also open in early March, transporting seeds, fertilizers, and agricultural tools to farmers in advance.

    According to the person in charge of the Tianjin transportation department, as long as all parties work harder and cooperate more, and strive to transport more at present, the transportation situation in Tianjin this year can be much better than last year.

    淡季多运货物　免得旺季太忙
    天津市积极组织运力和运量争取平衡全年的运输
    新华社天津25日电　新华社记者尹崇敬报道：在目前基本建设任务尚未确定，商业又进入淡季，运输显得比较清淡的时候，天津地区各交通运输部门和有关单位都采取措施，大力争取尽可能地多运出一些货物，以减少今后运输上的拥塞和紧张。
    天津市运输部门的负责人认为这是吸取了去年的一个重要的经验教训。去年第一季度天津地区的货物运输量很小，特别是基本建设几乎没有备料。从第二季度开始一直到年底，全盘的运输工作都是在紧张、忙乱、被动的情况下完成任务的。今年年初，类似的迹象又明显地出现了。天津区港务管理局2月份国内沿海商品吞吐总量将比去年最高的10月份减少45％；天津市汽车运输公司的夜运车已全部停驶，白天还要闲置一百辆左右的汽车运力；市内的数千辆马车每天只能拉半天活。铁路运输的情况比较好一些，但是在天津分局辖区内，今年2月份的货物发送量也比去年最紧张的11月份每天少一百车。
    天津市人民委员会和各交通运输部门鉴于此种情况，同时预计到今年全年商品和基本建设材料等的运输总量不会少于去年，整个运输任务仍然会相当紧张，于是及早采取了各种措施，组织运力和运量，争取平衡全年的运输。天津铁路分局原计划2月份运输沙、石、砖、石灰等建筑材料四千二百六十三车，到2月20日已超额完成任务，现在又开始把前些时由于客运繁忙而核减了的十列车沙石、一千多万块砖瓦等基本建设材料陆续恢复运输。铁路职工已提出了“能多运一车就多运一车”的口号，大力组织超计划运输。大量的基本建设材料到津以后，天津市物资供应处除了统一储存一部分以外，已根据建设工程集中、批准可能性大的工地预拨下去。存在本市郊区的数万立方公尺建设用的黄土和留在窑地上的两千多万块砖，也提前在2月份开始运交工地。总的打算在开工之前储备起全年需用材料的20％到25％。
    天津市国营商业部门也都尽可能地把商品提前下调。纺织品和针棉织品采购供应站把3月份供应计划中的春夏令商品提前在2月份调拨的，就有花布、色布等一百万公尺，汗衫、背心十万打。百货、文化用品等采购供应站也已把纸张、肥皂、球鞋、搪瓷用品等提前调往各地。
    此外，各交通运输部门还采取了许多争取在年初多运、早运的措施。一个多月来，天津区港务管理局向本外埠派出的人员就争取计划以外的煤炭、五金和杂货等货源一万多吨，准备运去上海。天津市运输公司分布在全市的二十一个营业所，全面出动承揽了大批货源，红桥区办事处访问一百一十个工商单位，就有四十九户托运了货物一千吨。冰凌翻滚的海河，按照往年的习惯总要到春暖时才能开航，今年从2月21日起，内河航运部门就开出了十只大木帆船躲凌运输；其他子牙河、南运河等河流，也将在3月初陆续开航，提前为农民运送种籽、肥料和农具。
    据天津市运输部门的负责人谈，只要各方面多努力多配合，争取在目前多运一些，今年天津市的运输状况可以比去年好得多。
