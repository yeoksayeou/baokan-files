Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou Electric Dispatch. A large-scale spring grain storage general survey is being fully launched in Zhejiang Province. The Grain Survey Committee, composed of the Provincial Grain Bureau, the Supervision Bureau, and the Public Security Bureau, has been established, and thirty-four cadres have been selected to assist local grain departments in conducting grain storage surveys in areas such as Zhoushan, Jiaxing, Jiande, Wenzhou, Jinhua, and Hangzhou. Grain survey command posts and grain survey teams have also been established in various special zones and more than eighty counties and cities throughout the province.

Since the autumn harvest of last year, farmers in Zhejiang Province have enthusiastically sold surplus grain and paid public grain, totaling billions of catties. Among the newly stored grain, high-moisture grain is quite common, and in some areas, spoilage of new grain has been discovered. According to statistics from the Provincial Grain Company, in January, high-moisture and insect-infested grain accounted for more than 50% of the total inventory. This province-wide grain storage general survey aims to quickly process high-moisture grain and eliminate insect-infested grain.

    浙江普查新粮储存情况
    据新华社杭州电　一个规模较大的春季储粮大会查正在浙江省全面展开。由省粮食厅、监察厅、公安厅组成的粮食会查委员会已经成立，并且已经抽调了三十四个干部分别到舟山、嘉兴、建德、温州、金华、杭州等地区协助当地粮食部门做好存粮会查工作。各个专区和全省八十多个县、市也都成立了粮食会查指挥部和粮食会查大队。
    从去年秋收后到现在，浙江省农民踊跃出售的余粮和缴纳的公粮已有数十亿斤，入库新粮中，高水份粮相当普遍，有的地区还发现有新粮霉烂的情况，据省粮食公司统计，一月份全省高水份和虫害粮占总库存量50％以上。这次组织的全省储粮大会查，要求迅速把高水份粮处理完，虫害粮食消灭光。
