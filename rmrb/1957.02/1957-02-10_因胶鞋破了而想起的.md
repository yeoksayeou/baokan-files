    Thoughts Inspired by a Broken Rubber Shoe	Wu Lü
    To this day, I still have a pair of sneakers under my bed. I bought these shoes several years ago, but I only wore them for a few months in total. At first, the back heel of the shoe tore, and then the toe area tore as well, eventually becoming irreparable. Should I patch them up? There were too many holes, making it impossible to patch them all. Should I throw them away? Looking at the soles, they were still sturdy, making it a shame to discard them. There was no solution, so I had to hide them under the bed. Whenever I cleaned, holding them in my hands, I couldn't help but feel a bit emotional: If the shoe factory had made the shoe uppers a bit more durable, wouldn't they have lasted longer?
    A few days ago, I read a piece of news in the Shanghai Liberation Daily, which made me feel something again. The news said: The Rubber Industry Bureau took six hundred pairs of sneakers and "Lishi" brand shoes and gave them to seven categories of people—coal miners, forestry workers, farmers, students, athletes, construction workers, and office workers—for a wear test. The test found that "athletes tend to wear out the soles before the uppers; farmers tend to wear out the uppers before the soles; coal miners' shoes are first punctured by coal chunks in the ankle area; forestry workers wear out both the soles and uppers quickly, their shoes being the most prone to tearing; construction workers, office workers, and students generally wear their shoes for a longer period; students mostly wear out the heel area first."
    This experiment is very interesting. It turns out that the way shoes wear out differs depending on the user. But no matter which type of person is wearing them, and whether the uppers or the soles wear out first, one thing is common: the shoes usually don't wear out completely at once. They wear out here first and then there, or there first and then here. This interesting experiment has revealed the different patterns of how sneakers and "Lishi" brand shoes wear out for different types of people.
    Coincidentally, I have an old newspaper from December of last year, which also has a news item saying that the person in charge of the Shanghai Tire and Rubber Shoe Industry Company calculated that if the wear time of rubber shoes is extended by 20%, it would be equivalent to producing more than twelve million pairs of rubber shoes for society. As for how to extend the wear time of rubber shoes by 20%, the news didn't explain in detail, only saying that some factories have already "appropriately increased the amount of rubber used."
    I think the different wear patterns of sneakers and "Lishi" brand shoes for different occupations, as revealed by the Rubber Industry Bureau, are very valuable for reference. Based on these patterns, differentiating the wear situations for different users, and focusing on strengthening the areas that wear out the most, producing "farmer rubber shoes," "student rubber shoes," "miner rubber shoes," "forestry worker rubber shoes," etc., can achieve the effect of extending product life at a minimal cost. This would both increase wealth for society, save raw materials for the country, and reduce losses for the people.
    Although it's just a shoe problem, I've learned a universal truth from it: By starting from specific situations, differentiating between different targets, and adopting different countermeasures, we can achieve twice the result with half the effort.

### 因胶鞋破了而想起的

    因胶鞋破了而想起的	吴滤
    至今，床底下还搁着一双球鞋。买这鞋，是几年前的事；穿它，却总共不过几个月。起初是后跟鞋帮上破了，后来脚趾面上也破了，终致不可收拾。补一补吧！前前后后，漏洞太多，补不胜补。扔了吧！看看鞋底，却还结实，未免可惜。没有办法，只得藏于床底。每逢扫除，捧在手上，总不免有些感慨：若是制鞋厂把鞋面做结实点，不是可以多穿些日子吗？
    前几天，在上海解放日报上读到一段新闻，不觉又有所感。新闻说：橡胶工业管理局拿了六百双球鞋和力士鞋，给采煤工人、林业工人、农民、学生、球员、建筑工人和职员七大类人，作了一次穿用试验，发现“球员是先破鞋底后破鞋面；农民是先破鞋面后破鞋底；采煤工人在脚腰部先被煤块刺破，林业工人既费大底又费鞋面，他们穿着鞋子最容易破裂；建筑工人、职员和学生一般穿着天数较长；学生大多是先磨破后跟部”。
    这个试验很有趣。原来穿用的对象不同，鞋子的破损情况也不同。但不管是哪一类人穿，不管是先破鞋面还是先破鞋底，有一点是共同的，即所谓鞋子穿破了，通常都不是全面的破，而是先破这里，后破那里；或是先破那里，后破这里。这个有趣的试验，是摸出了各类人穿球鞋和力士鞋破损情况的不同的规律。
    巧得很，手头有一张去年12月的旧报，上面也登了一条新闻，说上海轮胎胶鞋工业公司的负责人算了一笔账，如果胶鞋的穿用时间延长20％，就等于给社会多生产一千二百多万双胶鞋。至于怎样使胶鞋的穿用时间延长20％，新闻里没有详细说明，只说有些厂已经“适当地增加了一些橡胶用量”。
    我想，橡胶工业管理局摸出的不同职业的人穿用球鞋和力士鞋的不同的破损的规律，是很有参考价值的。根据这个规律，区别不同穿用对象的不同的破损情况，重点加强，生产一些“农民胶鞋”，“学生胶鞋”，“矿工胶鞋”，“林业工人胶鞋”等等，倒是可以以所费无几的代价，收延长产品寿命的功效的。如此，既给社会增加了财富，又给国家节省了原材料，还给人民减少了损失。
    虽然只是一个鞋子问题，从中却悟出一条普遍真理：凡事从具体情况出发，区别不同对象，采取不同对策，就能事半功倍。
