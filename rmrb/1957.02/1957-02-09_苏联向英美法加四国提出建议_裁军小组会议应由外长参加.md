Xinhua News Agency, New York, 8th. TASS reported from New York on the 8th: Kuznetsov, head of the Soviet delegation to the 11th session of the United Nations General Assembly, wrote to Lord Nobre, head of the British delegation, on the 7th. The letter stated that in view of the proposal by the delegations of Britain, the United States, France, and Canada to the United Nations General Assembly to hold a regular meeting of the Disarmament Commission's subcommittee in London on March 11 this year, the Soviet government agreed to hold the subcommittee meeting in London on the aforementioned date.

The letter stated that, proceeding from the necessity of promoting the attainment of practical results in the negotiations of the Disarmament Subcommittee at the regular meeting as much as possible, the Soviet government proposed that the subcommittee meeting should be a meeting at the level of foreign ministers, with the responsible representatives of military institutions, preferably chiefs of staff, and relevant economic and financial advisors participating. The Soviet government also hopes that this proposal, aimed at most effectively facilitating the solution of the disarmament issue, will be supported by the British government.

Identical letters were also sent to the heads of the United States, French, and Canadian delegations at the same time.

    苏联向英美法加四国提出建议
    裁军小组会议应由外长参加
    新华社8日讯　据塔斯社纽约8日讯：出席联合国大会第十一届会议的苏联代表团团长库兹涅佐夫7日写信给英国代表团团长诺布耳。信中说，鉴于英国在联合国大会代表英国、美国、法国和加拿大四国代表团提出在今年3月11日在伦敦召开联合国裁军委员会小组委员会例会的建议，苏联政府同意小组委员会在上述日期在伦敦召开。
    信中说，从尽量促成裁军小组委员会在例会上的谈判达成实际结果这一必要性出发，苏联政府建议小组委员会会议应当是外交部长级的会议，并有军事机构的负责代表，最好是参谋长参加以及经济和财政方面有关的顾问参加。苏联政府并且希望这一目的在于最有效地促成裁军问题的解决的建议能够得到英国政府的支持。
    内容相同的信件也在同时送交美国、法国、加拿大代表团团长。
