Today's Taiwan, wherever there are military facilities, is under the control and supervision of American military personnel. American jet planes frequently take off and land at airports. U.S. warships come and go on the Taiwan Strait. Air bases are piled high with American-made bombs. American generals constantly inspect Taiwan, treating it as an American colony. The United States also ordered the removal of Ingersoll from his concurrent position as commander of the Seventh Fleet and appointed him as commander of the U.S. Taiwan Defense Command, serving as the highest commander of U.S. forces and Chiang Kai-shek's troops in the Taiwan area.

Currently, the U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group (MAAG) in Taiwan is particularly busy, constantly going to various military bases in Taiwan to supervise and inspect the Chiang army. When this advisory group was first established in May 1951, it had a total of 116 personnel. In 1955, it increased to 350. Now it has expanded to about 3,000 people. In the Kuomintang military system in Taiwan, from the so-called "Ministry of National Defense" to the regiment, battalion, and company levels, there are American military advisors directly supervising the Chiang army. The U.S. military has established many air bases and arsenals in Tainan, Taoyuan, Hsinchu, Chiayi, Songshan, Taichung, and other places in Taiwan. They have seized Kaohsiung Port, Keelung Port, and Magong Port in the Penghu Islands as naval bases and stationed military personnel on the coastal islands.

The U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group is in charge of training the Chiang army. The various military schools of the Chiang army are entirely based on American military textbooks. Many officers of the Chiang army are also transferred to the United States for military training.

Chiang's officers and soldiers call the American military advisors "Supreme Emperors." The transfer and appointment of high-ranking Chiang army officers must be approved by the "Advisory Group." Chiang army division and regiment-level units must invite American military advisors for "guidance" when holding meetings. Even the payment of salaries and the supply of food for companies must be reviewed by the advisory group. American military personnel do not trust the Chiang army. During exercises, they sit in jeeps, gesticulating. When building fortifications, they force the Chiang army personnel to build everything according to their opinions. According to Chiang army soldiers who returned from Taiwan, they often saw American advisors chewing gum, swaggering in front of the Chiang army and scolding Chiang's officers and soldiers as "idiots" and "good-for-nothings." If they were slightly dissatisfied, they would yell and roar, push tables, throw benches, and punch people. Many Chiang army officers and soldiers were not convinced, and some secretly cursed the American military advisors as "dog-headed strategists."

With the continuous increase in the number of American military personnel arriving in Taiwan, the number of Taiwanese foreign affairs police increased sixfold last year to serve the Americans. There are more than 20 U.S. military hostels in Taipei, as well as many U.S. military clubs and U.S. military dependents' residences. However, the American advisory group personnel often criticize the Chiang Kai-shek clique for "poor hospitality" to the U.S. military.

Taiwan has become a paradise for American adventurers. Taiwan is now expanding the construction of U.S. military hostels in preparation for receiving more than 10,000 American officers from the United States stationed in Japan, South Korea, Okinawa, and the Philippines for vacations in Taiwan. Some scenic spots in Taipei have been occupied by Americans, with wooden signs reading "No Entry" or "U.S. Military Area" nailed up. Chinese people entering these places are often bitten by American dogs or insulted by American soldiers. Because tens of thousands of American military personnel in Taiwan have seized a lot of land for military use and the construction of barracks, countless poor residents have nowhere to live.

Now there are three "many's" in Taipei: many incidents of American soldiers causing trouble, many traffic accidents caused by American military vehicles on the road, and many drunken American soldiers on the streets. Every dusk, on many streets and alleys in Taipei, there are groups of two or three American soldiers, holding wine bottles, causing trouble everywhere. Taiwanese women passing through these areas are often insulted by American soldiers. Acts of robbery by American soldiers can be seen everywhere here. Some destroy the tables, chairs, bowls, and dishes in bars for fun, some chase women on the street, and some beat Chinese people under the influence of alcohol. American soldiers even caught all the fish in the Taipei park's pond.

The rampant and domineering behavior of American military personnel in Taiwan has aroused widespread anger in the hearts of the Taiwanese people. Incidents of American soldiers being beaten severely by Taiwanese people for their misdeeds have occurred throughout Taiwan. In Taipei, slogans such as "Yankee go home!" are often found written in chalk or pencil on walls and utility poles.

    美军在台湾
    丁固
    今日的台湾，凡是有军事设施的地方，都在美国军事人员的控制和监督之下。飞机场上美国喷气式飞机在频频地起飞和着陆，台湾海面上美军舰艇来来往往，各个空军基地上堆满了美国制的炸弹。美国的将军们不断到台湾视察，把台湾看成是美国的殖民地。美国还命令免去英格索尔原任第七舰队司令的兼职，派他专任美军协防台湾司令部司令，作为台湾地区的美军和蒋介石军队的最高指挥官。
    目前，美国驻台湾的军事援助顾问团人员特别忙碌，他们不断到台湾各个军事基地督促和检查蒋军。这个顾问团在1951年5月刚成立时，全部人员共有一百一十六人，1955年增加到三百五十人，现在已扩大到约三千人。在台湾国民党军事系统中，上至所谓“国防部”，下至团、营、连，都有美军顾问人员，直接监督蒋军。美军在台南、桃园、新竹、嘉义、松山、台中等地建立了许多空军基地和兵工厂，霸占了台湾的高雄港、基隆港和澎湖列岛的马公港作为海军基地，并在沿海岛屿上派驻了军事人员。
    美国驻台湾军事援助顾问团主持蒋军部队的训练，蒋军各个军事学校，都完全以美国的军事教材为蓝本。蒋军部队中还有许多军官被调往美国去受军事训练。
    蒋军官兵称美国军事顾问是“太上皇”。蒋军高级军官的调动任免要经“顾问团”的同意，蒋军师、团单位开会必须请美军顾问“指导”，甚至连队发饷和伙食供应也要经过顾问小组的审核。美国军事人员对蒋军很不信任。演习时，他们坐在吉普车上指手划脚；修筑工事时，他们逼着蒋军人员一切都要按照他们的意见来修筑。据从台湾归来的蒋军士兵说，经常见到嘴里嚼着口香糖的美军顾问，在蒋军部队前大摇大摆地骂蒋军官兵是“笨蛋”、“草包”，他们若有一点不如意就乱叫狂吼，推桌子，掷板凳，挥拳揍人。许多蒋军官兵都不服气，有的就背地里咒骂美军顾问是“狗头军师”。
    在美国军事人员到台湾的人数不断增加的情况下，去年一年中，台湾外事警察增加了六倍，来负责侍候美国人。台北市有二十多幢美军招待所，还有许多美军俱乐部和美军眷属住宅。但是，美国顾问团人员还经常指责蒋介石集团对美军“招待不周”。
    台湾已经成为美国冒险家的乐园。现在台湾正在扩大美军招待所的建筑，准备接待美国驻日本、南朝鲜、冲绳岛和菲律宾等地的一万多名美国军官到台湾休假。台北市有些风景区被美国人霸占，钉上了“禁止通行”或“美军重地”的木牌，进入这些场所的中国人常被美国的狼狗咬伤，或者受到美国兵的侮辱。由于在台湾的上万的美国军事人员强占了许多土地作为军事用地和建筑营房，以致无数贫苦的居民无处安身。
    现在台北市有三多：美国兵闹事多，马路上美军汽车肇事多，街头上美军醉鬼多。每当黄昏，在台北许多大街小巷，到处有手里拿酒瓶的美国兵三三两两地在胡闹。台湾妇女路过这些地区，常常受到美国兵的侮辱。在这里到处可以见到美国兵的强盗行为，他们有的把酒吧里的桌椅碗碟毁坏来取乐，有的当街追逐妇女，有的借醉殴打中国人。美国兵甚至把台北市公园水池里的鱼捉光。
    美国军事人员在台湾的横行霸道，已经普遍地引起台湾人民内心的愤怒。美军在胡作非为时被台湾人民痛打的事件，在台湾各地都有发生。台北市内，墙壁上和电线杆子上，常常发现用粉笔或铅笔写的“美国鬼子滚出去！”等标语。
