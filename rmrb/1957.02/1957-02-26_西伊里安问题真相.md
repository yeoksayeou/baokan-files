The West Irian issue is a matter of concern to peace-loving people in all countries. In recent years, this issue has been brought up for discussion at various international conferences countless times, but due to the obstruction of the colonialists, this issue has not yet been resolved.

    A Rich Island, A Miserable Life

West Irian is the easternmost territory of the Republic of Indonesia, connected to East Irian, which belongs to Australia; it has an area of 412,800 square kilometers and a population of over 500,000. The coastal areas have vast plains, where coconuts, rice, corn and other crops can be grown. The underground has rich mineral deposits such as oil, coal, copper, iron, iridium natural alloys, zinc, nickel, chromium, gold, silver, iron, asbestos, marble, etc., as well as uranium mines. However, most of these mineral deposits are undeveloped.

The Indonesian residents living on such a rich island live an extremely miserable life.

Due to the plunder of the Dutch colonialists, the people of West Irian are impoverished, various diseases are rampant, and the population is decreasing year by year. According to a report in the Dutch newspaper "World Business Daily" in June 1956, the infant mortality rate in West Irian reached 50%.

The Dutch colonialists implemented fascist rule over the residents of West Irian. The people of West Irian were prohibited from reading Indonesian newspapers and listening to Indonesian radio broadcasts. People had no freedom of movement, and there were Dutch military outposts everywhere along the road. At the Ninth United Nations General Assembly, Indonesian representative Sudjarwo stated when debating the West Irian issue that the number of barracks established by the Dutch authorities in West Irian far exceeded the number of schools in West Irian. Political parties in West Irian have always been prohibited from operating. In the forests of central West Irian, large-scale fascist concentration camps can still be seen, where countless Indonesian patriotic volunteers are detained.

    The Origin of the Problem

As we know, after Indonesia's independence on August 17, 1945, the Dutch colonialists, with the support of British and American imperialism, launched several armed attacks on Indonesia in an attempt to subvert this young republic. But they all suffered shameful defeats. The Netherlands and Indonesia signed the Linggadjati Agreement (March 1947) and the Renville Agreement (January 1948). The West Irian issue did not arise in these agreements. For example, Article 3 of the Linggadjati Agreement clearly stipulates: "The United States of Indonesia shall include the entire territory of the Netherlands East Indies archipelago." Article 6 of the Renville Agreement also stipulates: "The Kingdom of the Netherlands currently and in the future retains sovereignty over the entire Netherlands East Indies archipelago until the Kingdom of the Netherlands transfers its sovereignty to the United States of Indonesia after a certain period." Even in the Charter of Transfer of Sovereignty signed by the Netherlands and Indonesia in 1949, it was clearly stipulated that "the Kingdom of the Netherlands unconditionally and irrevocably transfers all sovereignty of Indonesia to the independent sovereign state of the Federal Republic of Indonesia." However, when transferring sovereignty, the Netherlands suddenly tore up all previous agreements and insisted on maintaining its colonial rule in West Irian. This is how the West Irian issue arose.

In order to achieve a fair and reasonable solution to the West Irian issue and allow the people of West Irian to return to Indonesia as soon as possible, the Indonesian government conducted several negotiations with the Netherlands in April 1950, December 1950, and from December 1951 to March 1952. The Indonesian government also made significant concessions, such as recognizing the existing interests and privileges of the Netherlands in West Irian, employing Dutch people in various institutions in West Irian, and the freedom of the Dutch to immigrate to West Irian, etc. However, the Dutch colonialists, with the support of imperialism, still refused to return West Irian to Indonesia with a barbaric attitude. More surprisingly, in 1952, while negotiations were underway, the Dutch colonialists, disregarding the strong opposition of the Indonesian and Dutch people, hastily passed a motion to amend Chapter 1 of the "Constitution of the Kingdom of the Netherlands." According to the amendment, West Irian was included in the territory of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Since 1954, the Netherlands has refused to negotiate with Indonesia. This shows the ambition of the Dutch colonialists to occupy West Irian for a long time.

    Ironclad Evidence of Race and History

The Dutch colonialists' excuse for occupying West Irian is that, racially speaking, West Irian has no connection with Indonesia. But this is completely a fallacy that violates science and facts.

The Republic of Indonesia is a multi-ethnic country. The ethnic groups of Indonesia are mainly divided into the Papuan, Vedda, and Malay groups, and these ethnic groups are further divided into several small ethnic groups. Since ancient times, these ethnic groups have lived together. They have close ties in language, culture, and customs, and this connection existed in prehistoric times. After research by world-renowned scientists such as the linguist and anthropologist Schmidt, the linguist Geblanch, the natural scientist Humboldt and other scientists, it has been proven that the language of West Irian and the languages of other regions of Indonesia belong to the same language family, namely the Austronesian language family. In addition to other common points, they have the same prefixes and suffixes, especially the similarity in the names of numbers is more significant. From the excavated human remains, these scientists have also proven that in prehistoric times, a group of immigrants from Southeast Asia distributed in other parts of Indonesia and some went to West Irian. Their significant similarities in customs, lifestyles, and languages ​​illustrate this fact.

The Dutch colonialists themselves cannot deny these facts. In 1949, the Netherlands wrote in its report to the United Nations: "Indonesia includes a series of island groups in the equatorial region,... Its indigenous peoples can be roughly divided into the Malay in the west and the Papuan in the east. Because these ethnic groups are quite mixed, they cannot be separated by boundaries."

Another excuse for the Dutch colonialists to occupy West Irian is that West Irian has no historical connection with the rest of the Republic of Indonesia. This argument is also absurd and untenable. Since ancient times, West Irian and the rest of Indonesia have had close ties. This is something that even Western colonialists themselves have to admit.

West Irian is a part of Indonesia, which has long been confirmed by world-renowned scholars, travelers, and historians. When Indonesia was still in prehistoric times, the ancient Indian epic "Ramayana" mentioned the gold and silver on the southeastern islands of Indonesia and the snow-capped mountains at the eastern end. At that time, Indian scholars believed that West Irian was part of the Moluccas and collectively called them Samudranta. The earliest records of Indonesia itself are in the Srivijaya Kingdom (which rose in South Sumatra around the 6th century) and the Majapahit Kingdom (which rose in East Java around the 13th century). In the Srivijaya Kingdom era, West Irian was called Janggi. We can see the reliefs depicting curly-haired people on the stone walls of the Borobudur Pagoda built in the Srivijaya Kingdom era. Scientists believe that these reliefs represent the Janggi people. It can be seen that at that time, West Irian had close ties with other parts of Indonesia. In the Majapahit era, historical works written by the court writer Prapanca and compiled by the politician Gajah Mada made an accurate record of the areas under the rule of Majapahit. According to this record, Indonesia was divided into two parts, east and west. When describing the east, it used many place names in West Irian, such as Waning, Sailan, etc. According to the research of European historians such as Gleren, Clone, and Dr. Loufer who studied Indonesian history, these two place names are Oning in Moklu Bay and Gouvias in southern West Irian today.

Long before Western colonialists began to enter the East Indies archipelago, they recognized that West Irian was part of Indonesia. Before the Dutch came to Indonesia, Portuguese merchants called Irian the Papua Island. In 1494, after a dispute arose between Portugal and Spain over the spices and maritime hegemony of Indonesia, the Treaty of Tordesillas was signed through the mediation of Pope Alexander VI. According to this agreement, Indonesia was divided into two parts by 120 degrees east longitude. Only Portuguese merchants were allowed to come and go in the west, and the east, including West Irian, was the domain of Spanish merchants. Soon after, Spanish merchants called Irian New Guinea.

In 1648, the Netherlands obtained the exclusive privilege of completely monopolizing the eastern and western islands of Indonesia, and in various international agreements signed later, such as the Munster Convention of 1648, the Treaty of Utrecht of 1714, the San Ildefonso Convention of 1797, and the London Convention of 1814, the Netherlands also recognized that West Irian was part of Indonesia. In 1884, when Britain declared Southeast Irian as its protectorate, Britain and the Netherlands took 141 degrees east longitude as the boundary between the two countries in Irian. The west belonged to the Dutch East Indies, namely the current West Irian. Before World War II, the Dutch colonial government included West Irian within the scope of the Moluccas provincial government as an administrative unit. It is worth noting that in all Dutch constitutions, West Irian is included in the territory of Indonesia and is an inseparable part of Indonesia. In its 1949 report to the United Nations, the Netherlands wrote: "The main part of Indonesia is the Greater Sunda Islands, the Lesser Sunda Islands, the Moluccas, and New Guinea west of 141 degrees east longitude." This is very clear and cannot be mistaken for anyone.

    A Base in the Eyes of Imperialism

Western colonialists deliberately occupy West Irian with ulterior motives. West Irian is a strategically important base in the eyes of the imperialists. The Dutch newspaper "World Business Daily" said when explaining the importance of West Irian that the strategic significance of West Irian made the Netherlands and the United States extremely interested in it. Another newspaper also nakedly exposed the United States' aggressive intentions, saying that if the United States wanted to "liberate the Indonesian archipelago," the base in West Irian was necessary. In the past and present, the Netherlands has repeatedly given the United States guarantees to establish military bases in West Irian in order to obtain American "aid" and maintain its colonial rule in Asia. Around the time of the first meeting between Indonesia and the Netherlands to negotiate the West Irian issue, American and Dutch imperialism strengthened this collusion. On August 29, 1950, Reuters reported that "Truman and MacArthur agreed at the meeting on Wake Island that a strong military base should be established in Irian. Truman also notified the Dutch government that the United States supported the Netherlands' refusal to Indonesia's request to recover Irian. In return, the Dutch government has agreed to grant the United States the privilege of establishing military bases in Irian." Agence France-Presse also reported that "Smith, the US representative to the Geneva Conference, met with Dutch Foreign Minister Luns, and they insisted that West Irian should be supervised by the Netherlands." In 1954, when the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly was debating the West Irian issue, Baldwin, the military commentator of "The New York Times," revealed the true intention of the United States and its North Atlantic Alliance to obstruct the people of West Irian from being liberated from the colonial shackles. He said that agreeing to Indonesia's request to recover West Irian "would be strategically insane. Any political decision regarding the transfer of New Guinea to Indonesian jurisdiction would weaken the United States' military position in the Pacific."

On May 20, 1956, Reston, the chief reporter of "The New York Times" in Washington, openly included West Irian in the US strategic system in the Pacific in an article. He said that the United States' "security structure on the Asian continent is not very good, and it relies on the naval and air forces based on the island chain composed of the Aleutian Islands, Japan, Okinawa, Taiwan, the Philippines, and New Guinea." The problem is very obvious, and the main reason why the US aggression group instigated the Netherlands to occupy West Irian for a long time lies here.

As for the fact that Western colonialists use West Irian to support Indonesian rebels in subversive activities, it is an open secret.

    Economic Plunder

Colonialists have been consolidating their economic power in West Irian and plundering the resources of West Irian in various ways. In 1953, the Netherlands sent a committee composed of professors from higher agricultural schools to West Irian to conduct investigations in order to provide "methods" for Dutch monopoly capital to better carry out economic plunder. According to a United Press International report on June 22, 1954, the Netherlands was preparing a ten-year development plan to "develop" West Irian, and said that many detailed methods had been formulated in close cooperation with Australia. Dutch Foreign Minister Luns also revealed that the Netherlands spends 125 million guilders annually on "construction and development" of West Irian, and plunders 95 million guilders of resources from the area annually. This is obviously a reduced figure. Not only that, but Dutch private capitalists are also active in West Irian. According to an Antara News Agency report, twelve Dutch companies formed the "New Guinea Development Company" with a capital of one million guilders to "develop" the resources of West Irian. The Dutch "Telegraaf" also reported news about Dutch big entrepreneurs requesting to mine nickel in West Irian.

In this tyrannical colonial plunder in West Irian, American monopoly capital also occupies a very important part. Long before World War II, American monopoly capitalists began to invest their capital in this region. For example, in 1934, the Netherlands leased the Vogelkop Peninsula to the "New Guinea Petroleum Company," which represents "Mobil Oil Company," "Shell Oil Company," and "Atlantic Refining Company," for a period of seventy-five years. This company gradually obtained the patent right to drill for oil. In recent years, the contradictions between imperialists in West Irian have also become increasingly acute. Although the old colonial country of the Netherlands has a long history in the economic plunder of West Irian, American capital, which is fighting with British and Dutch capital for West Irian oil mines, has gained the upper hand in the struggle. One of the new methods for the United States to implement intrusion and expansion in the economic field of the Dutch colonialists is to control Dutch enterprises. If the Dutch colonialists want to maintain their rights in Indonesia, they must make major concessions to Wall Street bosses. After World War II, countless American industrialists filled the various islands of the Indonesian archipelago. They bought up the stocks of British and Dutch companies and plundered the most important raw material resources. In this way, the largest oil mine discovered in Irian fell into the hands of the West Irian Petroleum Company, and 60% of the capital of this company belongs to the United States. In recent years, the company has also made many expansions, opened new mines, and installed new pipelines.

    The Struggle of the People of West Irian

As early as 1945, after Indonesia declared its independence, the anti-colonialist wave unfolded among the people of West Irian. In the same year, a powerful independence movement was launched in Dutch Dia and quickly spread to Biak, Serui, Manokwari, Wandamen, Sorong, Moklu Bay, Kaimana, Arguni Bay, Kaimana and Merauke. In 1946, under the leadership of Silas Papare, the people's hero of West Irian, the people of West Irian established the "Irian Indonesian Independence Party" to resist Dutch colonial rule. Two months later, the party established branches in more than ten places, including Nau, Barado, Ansus, and Moinawi. By March 1948, the number of party members had increased to two thousand. Due to the upsurge of the people's movement and the establishment of the party, the Dutch colonialists adopted extremely cruel means to suppress it, imprisoning a large number of West Irian people and implementing strict inspection systems and other colonial measures. But all this cannot obliterate the fact that the people of West Irian demand liberation from colonial rule, nor can it make the people of West Irian surrender. More riots occurred in 1946 and 1947. In March 1948, the people of Biak also rose up against the Netherlands. The colonialists increasingly felt the power of the anti-colonialist wave, and mobilized the police and army to suppress it on the one hand, and created disputes between various tribes on the other. But the struggle of the people of West Irian to return to Indonesia has never stopped. Last December, newspapers in Jakarta published news of the West Irian people's uprising against Dutch rule. These facts powerfully show how shameful the lie that the Western colonialists call "primitive Papuans" have no demands to return to Indonesia is.

West Irian is an inseparable part of the territory of the Republic of Indonesia. For centuries, colonialists have used all kinds of vicious means to extract the blood and sweat of the Indonesian people. In order to suppress the national liberation movement of the Indonesian and West Irian people, the colonialists used bayonets and cannons to slaughter hundreds of thousands of Indonesian people, and countless properties were burned and looted by the colonialists. But the Indonesian people will never surrender, and West Irian will surely return to the embrace of Indonesia.

    西伊里安问题真相
    张舒平
    西伊里安问题是世界各国爱好和平的人们所关心的问题之一。近几年来，这个问题曾被提到各种国际会议上进行过无数次的讨论，但是由于殖民主义者的百般阻挠，这个问题到现在还没有得到解决。
    富饶的岛屿，悲惨的生活
    西伊里安是印度尼西亚共和国最东部的领土，与澳大利亚所属的东伊里安相连；面积为四十一万二千八百平方公里，人口五十余万。沿海地带有辽阔的平原，可以种植椰子、稻米、玉米和其他农作物。地下有丰富的矿藏如石油、煤、铜、铁、铱天然合金、锌、镍、铬、金、银、铁、石棉、大理石等，此外还有铀矿。但是，这些矿藏多未开发。
    生活在这样富饶的岛屿上的印度尼西亚居民，却过着极端悲惨的生活。
    由于荷兰殖民者的掠夺，西伊里安人民贫困不堪，各种疾病蔓延，人口逐年减少。据荷兰“世界商报”1956年6月报道，西伊里安婴儿的死亡率达到50％。
    荷兰殖民者对西伊里安居民实行法西斯统治。西伊里安人民被禁止阅读印度尼西亚的报纸和收听印度尼西亚电台的广播。人们没有行动的自由，路旁到处都是荷兰军队的岗哨。在第九届联合国大会上，印度尼西亚代表苏加沃在辩论西伊里安问题时发言说，荷兰当局在西伊里安所建立的兵营的数目，远远超过了西伊里安学校的数目。西伊里安的政治党派一直被禁止活动。人们在西伊里安中部的森林里还可以看到大规模的法西斯集中营，无数印度尼西亚的爱国志士被拘禁在这里。
    问题的来由
    我们知道，1945年8月17日印度尼西亚独立以后，荷兰殖民者在英、美帝国主义支持之下对印度尼西亚发动过数次武装进攻，企图颠覆这个年轻的共和国。但都遭到可耻的失败。荷兰和印度尼西亚签订了林芽椰蒂协定（1947年3月）和伦维尔协定（1948年1月）。在这些协定中并未发生西伊里安问题。例如，林芽椰蒂协定第三条明确规定：“印度尼西亚联邦包括尼德兰东印度群岛的全部领土”。伦维尔协定在第六条中也规定：“荷兰王国在目前和将来都保有整个尼德兰东印度群岛的主权，直到一定时期以后荷兰王国将其主权移交给印度尼西亚联邦为止”。甚至在1949年荷印双方签署的移交主权宪章中也十分明确地规定：“荷兰王国无条件地并绝不变更地把印度尼西亚的全部主权移交给独立的主权国家印度尼西亚联邦共和国”。但是，在移交主权的时候，荷兰却突然撕毁了以前所有的协定，坚持在西伊里安继续维持它的殖民统治。西伊里安问题就是这样产生的。
    为了使西伊里安问题得到公平合理的解决，使西伊里安人民早日回到印度尼西亚的怀抱，印度尼西亚政府曾在1950年4月、1950年12月、1951年12月和1952年1月至3月和荷兰进行过数次谈判。印度尼西亚政府也作过重大的让步，例如承认荷兰在西伊里安现有的利益和特权、西伊里安的各机构中雇用荷兰人、荷兰有移民至西伊里安的自由等等。但是荷兰殖民者在帝国主义的支持下仍然以蛮横的态度拒绝把西伊里安归还给印度尼西亚。更奇怪的是1952年正当谈判进行中间，荷兰殖民者不顾印度尼西亚人民和荷兰人民的强烈反对，匆匆通过了一项修改“荷兰王国宪法”第一章的议案。根据该修正案，西伊里安被列入荷兰王国的领土范围之内。1954年以后荷兰一直拒绝和印度尼西亚谈判。这说明了荷兰殖民主义者企图长期霸占西伊里安的野心。
    种族和历史的铁证
    荷兰殖民者霸占西伊里安的借口是，从种族方面说，西伊里安同印度尼西亚没有关系。但这完全是违反科学和事实的谬论。
    印度尼西亚共和国是一个多民族的国家。印度尼西亚的民族主要分为巴布亚族、吠陀族和马来族，这些民族又各分为若干细小的种族群。自古以来，这些民族就生活在一起。他们在语言、文化以及风俗习惯上有着密切的联系，这种联系在史前时期就已存在。经过世界著名的科学家如语言和人类学家席米德、语言学家盖布兰支、自然科学家洪保德和别的科学家们的研究，已经证明西伊里安的语言和印度尼西亚其他地区的语言属于同一语系，即奥斯特罗尼西亚语系，除了其他共同点之外，它们有相同的字头和字尾，尤其是数字名称的相同点更为显著。从发掘出来的人类遗骨中，这些科学家们还证明了在史前时期，由东南亚来的移民群一部分分布在印度尼西亚其他各地，一部分到了西伊里安。他们在风俗习惯、生活方式以及语言上的显著的相同点，说明了这个事实。
    荷兰殖民者自己也不能否认这些事实。1949年，荷兰给联合国的报告中是这样写的：“印度尼西亚包括赤道地区一系列的岛屿群，……它的土著民族可大略分为西部的马来族和东部的巴布亚族。由于这些民族相当混杂，不能用界线把他们截然分开。”
    荷兰殖民者霸占西伊里安的另一个借口是，西伊里安和印度尼西亚共和国的其余部分没有历史上的联系。这种论调也是荒谬绝伦的和站不住脚的。自古以来西伊里安和印度尼西亚其余部分就有着密切的联系。这一点就是西方殖民者自己也不得不承认。
    西伊里安是印度尼西亚的一部分，这一点早为世界著名的学者、旅行家和历史学家所证实。当印度尼西亚还处在史前时期的时候，印度古代的史诗“罗摩耶那”曾提到印度尼西亚东南岛屿上的金银和东端终年积雪的山峰。在那个时候，印度的学者就认为西伊里安是摩鹿加群岛的一部分，并把它们合起来叫做萨姆德兰达。印度尼西亚自己最早的记载是在三佛齐王国（约在第六世纪时兴起于南苏门答腊）和满者帕夷王国（约在十三世纪时兴起于东爪哇）时代。在三佛齐王国时代，西伊里安叫做将基。我们在三佛齐王国时代修建的波罗浮屠佛塔的石壁上可以看到描写卷发人的浮雕。这些浮雕科学家们认为是代表将基人的。由此可见当时西伊里安与印度尼西亚其他各地已有了密切的联系。在满者帕夷时代，由宫廷作家普拉班加撰写、政治家迦查·马达编纂的历史著作，对于满者帕夷统治下的地区作了精确的记载，按照这个记载，印度尼西亚当时被分为东西两个部分。在描写东部时，它用了许多西伊里安的地名，例如瓦宁、赛兰等。据研究印度尼西亚历史的欧洲的历史学家如格冷、克隆和卢弗尔博士的研究，这两个地名也就是今天摩克鲁尔海湾的奥宁和西伊里安南部的高维亚。
    远在西方殖民者开始进入东印度群岛时就承认了西伊里安是印度尼西亚的一部分。在荷兰人还未来到印度尼西亚之前，葡萄牙商人把伊里安叫做巴布亚岛。1494年，因葡、西两国争夺印度尼西亚的香料和海上霸权而发生争执后，经罗马教皇亚历山大第六的调解签订了多尔地西拉条约。根据这个协定，以东经一百二十度把印度尼西亚分为两部分。西部只许葡萄牙商人来往，东部包括西伊里安在内则是西班牙商人的范围。不久以后，西班牙商人便把伊里安叫做新几内亚。
    1648年，荷兰取得了完全垄断印度尼西亚东西各岛屿的特权，并且在以后签订的各个国际协定中如1648年的蒙斯特公约、1714年的乌特列支协定、1797年的圣·依德芬索协定、1814年的伦敦协定等，荷兰也承认西伊里安是印度尼西亚的一部分。1884年，当英国宣布东南伊里安为其保护国时，英荷两国即以东经一百四十一度为两国在伊里安的边界，西面属荷属东印度群岛即现在的西伊里安。第二次世界大战以前，荷兰殖民政府把西伊里安包括在摩鹿加省政府的范围之内，作为其行政的一个单位。值得注意的是在所有的荷兰宪法中，也都把西伊里安包括在印度尼西亚的版图之内，是印度尼西亚不可分割的一部分。1949年荷兰给联合国的报告中写道：“印度尼西亚的主要部分是大巽他群岛、小巽他群岛、摩鹿加群岛和东经一百四十一度以西的新几内亚”。这对任何人来说都是非常清楚而不会弄错的。
    帝国主义心目中的基地
    西方殖民者蓄意霸占西伊里安有着不可告人的目的。西伊里安在帝国主义者的心目中是一个富有战略意义的基地。荷兰的“世界商报”在解释西伊里安的重要性时说，西伊里安的战略意义使荷兰与美国对他发生了极大的兴趣。另一家报纸也赤裸裸地暴露了美国的侵略意图说，假如美国想要“解放印度尼西亚群岛”的话，西伊里安的基地是必要的。过去和现在，荷兰一再给与美国在西伊里安建立军事基地的保证，以便取得美国的“援助”并维持其亚洲的殖民统治。当印度尼西亚与荷兰第一次谈判西伊里安问题的会议前后，美、荷帝国主义便加强了这种勾结。1950年8月29日路透社报道说，“杜鲁门和麦克阿瑟在威克岛的会谈，已经同意应在伊里安建立强固的军事基地。杜鲁门并已通知荷兰政府，美国支持荷兰拒绝印度尼西亚收回伊里安的要求。荷兰政府为报答美国，已同意给予美国在伊里安建立军事基地的特权”。法新社也曾报道说，“美国出席日内瓦会议的代表史密斯曾与荷兰外长伦斯会谈，彼等坚持西伊里安应为荷兰所监督”。1954年，当联合国大会政治委员会就西伊里安问题进行辩论时，“纽约时报”的军事评论员鲍德温就透露了美国和它的北大西洋联盟企图阻挠西伊里安人民从殖民枷锁中解放出来的真正意图。他说，要是同意印度尼西亚收回西伊里安的要求
  “就是在战略上发了疯。关于把新几内亚移交给印度尼西亚管辖的任何政治决定，都会削弱美国在太平洋中的军事地位”。
    1956年5月20日，“纽约时报”驻华盛顿的首席记者赖斯顿在一篇文章里就公然把西伊里安列入美国在太平洋的战略体系之内。他说，美国在亚洲大陆上的“安全机构并不是很好的，它依靠以阿留申群岛、日本、冲绳、台湾、菲律宾和新几内亚组成的岛屿链环为基地的海空军力量。”问题很明显，美国侵略集团所以唆使荷兰长期霸占西伊里安的主要原因就在这里。
    至于西方殖民者利用西伊里安支持印度尼西亚叛乱分子进行颠覆活动，更是人所共知的事实。
    经济掠夺
    殖民主义者一直都在西伊里安巩固其经济势力，用各种方式掠夺西伊里安的资源。1953年荷兰曾派出由高等农业学校的教授组成的委员会到西伊里安进行考查，以便提供使荷兰垄断资本能更好地进行经济掠夺的“方法”。据合众社1954年6月22日的消息说，荷兰正在准备“开发”西伊里安的十年开发计划，并说，在与澳大利亚的紧密合作下，许多详细作法已经订出。荷兰外交大臣伦斯也曾透露，荷兰每年支出一万二千五百万荷盾作为“建设和开发”西伊里安之用，并每年从该地掠夺九千五百万荷盾的资源。这显然是缩小了的数字。不仅如此，荷兰的私人大资本家在西伊里安也大肆活动。据安塔拉通讯社的报道，荷兰的十二家公司以一百万荷盾的资金组成了“新几内亚开发公司”，以“开发”西伊里安的资源。荷兰“电讯报”也报道过关于荷兰大企业家要求开采西伊里安镍矿的消息。
    在西伊里安的这种横暴的殖民掠夺中，美国的垄断资本也占着很重要的一部分。远在第二次世界大战以前，美国的垄断资本家便开始把他们的资本投到这个地区来了。例如1934年荷兰就把窝格柯普半岛租给了代表“美孚石油公司”、“壳牌石油公司”和“大西洋炼油公司”的“新几内亚石油公司”，为期七十五年。这个公司逐渐获得了钻探石油的专利权。近年来，帝国主义者在西伊里安的矛盾也日趋尖锐化了，老牌殖民国家荷兰虽然在西伊里安的经济掠夺中有了长远的历史，而与英、荷资本在争夺西伊里安油矿的美国资本已在斗争中获得了上风。美国在荷兰殖民者的经济领域中实行侵入和扩张的新方法之一，就是控制荷兰企业。如果荷兰殖民者想要维持它在印度尼西亚的权利的话，就必须向华尔街老板作重大让步。在第二次世界大战之后，无数美国实业家塞满在印度尼西亚群岛的各个岛上。他们收买英国和荷兰公司的股票，掠夺最重要的原料资源。这样，在伊里安发现的最大的石油矿，就落入西伊里安石油公司的手中，而这个公司60％的资本是属于美国的。近年来该公司又作了不少扩充，开钻了新的矿井，安装了新的油管。
    西伊里安人民的斗争
    早在1945年印度尼西亚宣布独立以后，反对殖民主义的浪潮就在西伊里安人民中间展开了。同年在荷兰底亚掀起了有力的独立运动，并且迅速地扩展到比亚、赛鲁依、马诺圭里、万达曼、梭弄、摩克卢尔海湾、花花、阿古尼海湾、盖马那和默鲁克等地。1946年，在西伊里安的人民英雄西拉斯·帕帕勒的领导之下，西伊里安人民成立了“伊里安印度尼西亚独立党”，反抗荷兰的殖民统治。在两个月以后该党又在拿乌、巴拉多、安苏斯、麦那威等十多处成立了支部，到1948年3月党员人数已增加为二千人。由于人民运动的高涨和该党的成立，荷兰殖民者便采取了极端残酷的手段来进行镇压，监禁了大批的西伊里安人民，实行严格的检查制度和其他殖民措施。但这一切并不能抹杀西伊里安人民要求从殖民统治中解放出来的事实，也不能使西伊里安人屈服。1946年和1947年又发生了更多的暴动。1948年3月比亚的人民也起来反对荷兰。殖民者越来越感觉到反殖民主义浪潮的强大，便一方面调动警察和军队进行镇压，一方面在各个部落之间制造纠纷。但是西伊里安人民争取回到印度尼西亚的斗争却从来也没有停止过。去年12月间，雅加达各报纸又刊登了西伊里安人民反对荷兰的统治而起义的消息。　　这些事实有力地说明了西方殖民者所谓“原始巴布亚人”没有要求重新归到印度尼西亚的呼声这一谎言是多么可耻。
    西伊里安是印度尼西亚共和国领土不可分割的一部分。数世纪以来，殖民者曾用了种种恶毒的手段榨取印度尼西亚人民的血汗。为了镇压印度尼西亚和西伊里安人民的民族解放运动，殖民者曾经用刺刀和大炮屠杀过成千上万的印度尼西亚人民，无数的财产被殖民主义者烧毁和掠夺。但是印度尼西亚人绝不会屈服，西伊里安一定能回到印度尼西亚的怀抱。
