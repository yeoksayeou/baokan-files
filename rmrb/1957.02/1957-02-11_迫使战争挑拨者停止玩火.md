    Force the Warmongers to Stop Playing with Fire
    Increasingly more facts show that the American ruling clique has made stepping up preparations for atomic war an important part of its further arms expansion plan. After the U.S. government announced its intention last month to station atomic forces on the territory of other countries, it aroused strong opposition from the people of all countries and was severely warned by the Soviet Union, but the U.S. authorities continue to create atomic war threats everywhere. Washington recently revealed that the United States is prepared to supply missiles to Britain and Japan, and has decided to set up Matador missiles in our territory of Taiwan.
    These measures taken by the United States, like the aggressive "Eisenhower Doctrine" it announced, are clearly aimed at poisoning the international atmosphere and continuing to create a "cold war" to obstruct the trend of gradual relaxation of the international situation due to the failure of imperialism on the two fronts of Hungary and Egypt.
    However, the US atomic intimidation policy will never intimidate the Chinese people, the Soviet people, and the people of other socialist countries. Because everyone knows that the United States is not a monopolist in nuclear weapons and missiles. It can never gain any advantage from atomic intimidation and atomic adventures.
    It is worth pointing out that the US plan to prepare for atomic war will bring great danger to those countries that provide their territory to the US as atomic war bases. In fact, the people of these countries have long recognized the serious harm that this aggressive step by the United States poses to their national security and national interests, and therefore they have resolutely opposed the United States turning their land into bases for atomic war. Under pressure from the Japanese people, the Japanese government has stated that it cannot agree to the United States stationing atomic forces in Japan; the Japanese Socialist Party's opposition to the US supplying missiles to Japan has resonated within the country. Japan is also opposed to the British conducting hydrogen weapons tests in the Pacific this summer.
    The series of activities of the United States stepping up atomic war preparations and binding other countries to its atomic war chariot has exposed to the people of the world that the recent talk by some government leaders in the United States about America's peaceful intentions is nothing but a deceptive lie.
    All peace-loving countries and people in the world, as well as all sober-minded public opinion, should face up to the serious threat posed by the atomic war preparations of the American bellicose clique to the cause of international peace and security, and mobilize all forces to force the war provocateurs to stop playing with fire.

    迫使战争挑拨者停止玩火
    愈来愈多的事实表明，美国统治集团已把加紧准备原子战争作为它进一步扩军计划的重要部分。美国政府上月宣布打算在别国领土上驻扎原子部队以后，曾引起了各国人民的强烈反对，并且受到苏联的严正警告，但是美国当局仍继续在各处制造原子战争的威胁。华盛顿方面最近透露，美国准备把导弹供给英国和日本，并且决定在我国领土台湾设置斗牛士式导弹。
    美国采取的这些措施，和它宣布的“艾森豪威尔主义”的侵略计划一样，目的显然企图毒化国际气氛，继续制造“冷战”，以阻挠国际局势由于帝国主义在匈牙利和埃及两条战线上的失败而逐渐缓和的趋势。
    但是美国的原子恫吓政策决不能吓倒中国人民、苏联人民和其他社会主义国家的人民。因为谁都知道，美国在核子武器和导弹方面都不是垄断者。它决不可能从原子恫吓和原子冒险中得到任何便宜。
    值得指出的是，美国准备原子战争的计划将对那些把自己领土供给美国用作原子战争基地的国家带来莫大的危险。事实上这些国家的人民早已认识到美国这种侵略步骤对他们国家的安全和民族利益的严重危害，因此他们一直坚决反对美国把他们的国土变成原子战争的基地。日本政府在日本人民的压力下，表示不能同意美国在日本驻扎原子部队；日本社会党反对美国把导弹供给日本的主张，已在国内引起了共鸣。日本也同样反对英国今年夏天要在太平洋进行氢武器试验。
    美国加紧进行原子备战并把其他国家绑在它的原子战争之上的一连串活动，向全世界人民暴露了美国一些政府领袖近来大谈美国的和平意愿不过是骗人的谎话。
    全世界爱好和平的国家和人民以及所有清醒的舆论，应当正视美国好战集团的原子备战活动对国际和平和安全事业所带来的严重威胁，并动员一切力量，迫使战争挑拨者停止玩火。
