Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, February 11th: January was the first month of Chongqing's campaign to increase production and practice economy. All eight systems in the city, including iron and steel, coal, electricity, machinery, chemical industry, textile, construction, and local industries, have completed or overfulfilled their total output value plans. Excluding the local industrial system, state-owned and joint state-private large-scale factories and mines completed 110.58% of their January total output value plan, an increase of 53.03% compared to the same period last year.

    At the beginning of January, when the campaign to increase production and practice economy began, many factories and mines felt that the tasks were tight and raw materials were lacking. At the same time, technical equipment could not keep up with the needs of production, so they lacked confidence in completing the state plan. However, the workers still came up with many ways to overcome the difficulties. Natural combustion was discovered in the coal seams of fire zones and gas outburst zones in the Tianfu and Nantong coal mines, the two largest coal mines in Southwest China, which seriously affected the completion of the state plan. After discovering natural combustion in the coal seams being mined at the beginning of the month, the workers of the Nantong Coal Mine immediately sealed off a mining area that accounted for a quarter of the entire mine. At the same time, they opened seven more shafts for mining, overcoming the difficulty of mining coal seams in the fire zone and gas outburst zone, and overfulfilled the production plan by 5.85%. In January, the city's coal mining enterprises increased the country's production by more than 7,270 tons of raw coal and eliminated major personal injury accidents. Faced with tight raw material supply and insufficient clinker supply, the workers of the Chongqing Cement Plant managed to increase the output of mixed materials to ensure supply. In the local electromechanical and heavy chemical enterprises, where the supply of raw materials was relatively difficult, the actual total industrial output value completed in January also increased by one and a half times compared to the same period last year. The Chongqing Electrical Equipment Factory and the Chongqing Iron Factory could not supply the large number of welding rods required in January this year. The two factories used the iron-chromium and steel plate scraps cut off from production to make them themselves, so that production was not affected.

    Many factories and mines in the city also started by summarizing the experiences and lessons of last year, and found ways to increase production and practice economy in response to the weak links in production last year. According to the many accidents and poor quality last year, the Chongqing Iron and Steel Company paid attention to quality and the safety of equipment and personnel from the beginning of this year. Therefore, it comprehensively completed the national plan for January. Steel alone increased by 2,967 tons; the quality of steel, steel billets, and steel plates produced by the open hearth furnace workshop and the large rolling mill workshop all created new records that the factory had not or rarely had in the past.

    重庆市八个工业系统
    完成一月份总产值计划
    据新华社重庆11日电　1月份是重庆市开展增产节约运动的第一个月。全市钢铁、煤炭、电力、机械、化学工业、纺织、建筑、地方工业等八个系统都完成或超额完成了总产值计划。全市除地方工业系统以外，国营和公私合营大型厂矿完成了1月份总产值计划的110.58％，比去年同期增长53.03％。
    1月初当增产节约运动开始的时候，不少厂矿都感到任务紧、原材料缺，同时技术设备赶不上生产的需要，因此对完成国家计划缺乏信心。但是，职工们还是想出了许多办法来克服困难。西南最大的两个煤矿——天府和南桐煤矿的火区煤层和瓦斯突出区煤层里发现了自然发火现象，严重地影响着国家计划的完成。南桐煤矿的职工在月初发现采掘的煤层里自然发火的现象后，立即在占全矿四分之一的采区里进行了密闭，同时另开了七个眼进行采掘，克服了火区和瓦斯突出区煤层开采的困难，超额5.85％完成了生产计划。全市煤矿企业在1月份里共计为国家增产了七千二百七十多吨原煤，并且消灭了重大的人身死亡事故。重庆水泥厂的职工们在原材料紧张、熟料供应不足的情况下，设法提高了混合材料产量，保证了供应。原材料供应较为困难的地方机电、重化工企业，1月份实际完成的工业总产值也比去年同期增长了一倍半。重庆电工器材厂、重庆铁工厂今年1月份所需要的大量焊条供应不上，两个厂就利用生产上剪裁下来的铁铬、钢板边料自制，使生产没有受到影响。
    全市不少厂矿还从总结去年的经验教训着手，针对去年生产上的薄弱环节，找出了增产节约的途径。重庆钢铁公司根据去年事故多、质量差等情况，今年这个厂一开始就重视了质量以及设备和人身的安全，因此全面地完成了1月份的国家计划，其中仅钢材一项就增产了二千九百六十七吨；小平炉车间和大型轧钢车间生产的钢、钢胚、钢板质量，都创造了这个厂过去所没有或很少有的新纪录。
