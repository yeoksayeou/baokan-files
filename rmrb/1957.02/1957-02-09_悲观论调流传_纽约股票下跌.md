    Xinhua News Agency, 8th Dispatch from New York: New York Stock Exchange prices fell sharply on the 5th. The stock prices of many large monopolies in the metallurgical industry, aviation industry, and other industrial sectors fell by two, three, or more than three dollars per share. This decline reduced the total value of stocks on the New York Stock Exchange by approximately $2.9 billion.
    For the past three or four months, the New York stock market has been sluggish and has been falling from time to time.
    Stockbrokers believe that the fall in stock prices is due to the "pessimistic views circulating among financial circles and others." The Associated Press reported that the sharp fall in the stock market on the 5th may have been because customers noticed the warning from former US President Hoover that the United States is facing the threat of economic decline.
    "U.S. News & World Report," which often pays attention to American economic trends, believes that the decline in stock prices reflects a growing mood of uncertainty about the economic future.
    "The Wall Street Journal" published the recent opinions of banking professor Raymond Rodgers at a meeting of the "American Bankers Association," where he said: "It now appears that American prosperity is ending faster than expected four weeks ago." He believes that economic difficulties in Europe, mainly caused by the lack of oil, will affect the American economy.

    悲观论调流传
    纽约股票下跌
    新华社8日讯　纽约消息：纽约股票交易所牌价在5日大跌，冶金工业、航空工业和其他工业部门的许多大垄断公司的股票牌价每股下跌了二美元、三美元或者三美元以上。这次下跌使纽约交易所的股票总值大约缩减了二十九亿美元。
    最近三、四个月以来，纽约股票行市就一直处在疲滞状态，并且不时下跌。
    股票经纪人认为，股票牌价下跌是由于在“金融界和其他人士中间流传的悲观论调”造成的。美联社的消息指出，5日交易所股票行市大跌，可能是因为顾客们注意到了美国前总统胡佛的警告，他说美国面临经济衰落的威胁。
    经常注意美国经济动态的“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志认为，交易所股票牌价下跌的情况反映了对经济前途没有把握的情绪正在增长。
    “华尔街日报”刊载了银行学教授雷蒙德·罗吉斯最近在“美国银行家协会”的一次会议上发表的意见，他说：“现在看来美国的繁荣比四个星期以前所预料的结束得还要快。”他认为，欧洲主要是由于石油缺乏而引起的经济困难会影响到美国的经济。
