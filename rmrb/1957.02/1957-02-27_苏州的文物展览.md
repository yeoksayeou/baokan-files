    Suzhou's Cultural Relics Exhibition, held at the Xuanmiao Temple in Suzhou, concluded on the 24th.

    Suzhou is a famous historical and cultural city, with a particularly large number of inscriptions and steles from various dynasties. The exhibition included a rubbing of the famous Stele of Han Qi. Han Shizhong was a famous general of the Song Dynasty who resisted the Jin Dynasty. He and his wife, Liang Hongyu, lived in the Canglang Pavilion in Suzhou and were buried together under Lingyan Mountain after their deaths. This stele is now located east of Han Shizhong's tomb on the western slope of Lingyan Mountain. The inscription consists of eighty-eight lines, each line with one hundred and fifty characters, totaling more than thirteen thousand characters. Rubbings of the astronomical and geographical charts drawn by Huang Shang of the Song Dynasty are cultural relics with high scientific and historical value. According to many historical scientists, the astronomical chart is the earliest astronomical chart in the world. The geographical chart depicts the territory of the Song Dynasty, and its longitude and latitude positions are almost the same as those of today's maps. Unearthed cultural relics include the ant-nose coins of the Warring States period and coins from various dynasties, which are valuable materials for studying China's history.

    Many calligraphy and paintings donated by the masses after liberation were also displayed at the exhibition. "Five Kings at Play in Spring," painted by a person from the Southern Song Dynasty, is a rare ancient work. Flower and bird album pages by the famous Ming Dynasty painter Shen Zhou, "Li Duanduan Sheds Her Identity" painted by Tang Yin depicting the famous courtesan of Yangzhou in the Tang Dynasty, landscape handscrolls and fan paintings by Wen Zhengming, and regular and cursive scripts by Zhu Yunming are all rare and precious treasures.

    In recent years, the Suzhou Municipal Cultural Relics Preservation Committee has collected tens of thousands of valuable books and many historical documents from waste paper piles and old books. A portion of them were also exhibited at the exhibition.

    Many ancient and exquisite handicrafts among the arts and crafts exhibits show that Suzhou has historically been a particularly developed city for handicrafts. In terms of embroidery, there are Ming Dynasty embroidery works such as "Immortals Celebrating Longevity," and the twelve zodiac signs embroidered by the famous modern artist Shen Shou. Suzhou's jade carving is well-known at home and abroad. The exhibits include a jade toad weighing more than fifty pounds, and various exquisitely and delicately carved small ornaments.

    During the exhibition, people reported clues about cultural relics and historical sites to the exhibition every day, requesting the government to pay attention to their preservation. (Xinhua News Agency)

    苏州的文物展览
    在苏州市玄妙观举办的文物展览会已在24日结束。
    苏州是著名的文化古城，遗存的历代碑刻特别多。展览会上有著名的韩蕲王碑的拓本。韩世忠是宋代抗金名将。他和他的夫人梁红玉在苏州沧浪亭住过，死后合葬在灵岩山下。这块碑现在灵岩山西麓韩世忠墓东面。碑文共有八十八行，每行一百五十字，共一万三千多字。宋代黄裳画的天文图和地理图碑刻拓本是有很高科学历史价值的文物。据许多历史科学家考证，天文图是现在世界上最早的一张天文图。地理图画的是宋朝的版图，经纬位置和现在的地图差不多。出土文物中有明代唐伯虎、祝枝山、文征明写的墓志石刻。展品中的战国时的蚁鼻钱及历代钱币，是研究我国历史的宝贵资料。
    解放后群众捐献的不少书画也陈列在展览会上。南宋人画的五王嬉春图是一幅很难得的古代作品。明代名画家沈石田的花鸟册页，唐伯虎画的唐代扬州名妓李端端脱籍图，文征明的山水平卷和扇面，及祝枝山的楷书和草书等都是不可多得的名贵珍品。
    近几年来，苏州市文物保管委员会从废纸堆和旧书中搜集到十几万册有价值的图书和很多历史文献。展览会上也展出了其中的一部分。
    工艺美术展品中的许多古老而精致的手工艺品，说明苏州在历史上就是个手工艺特别发达的城市。刺绣方面有明代绣品“群仙祝寿图”，近代名艺人沈寿绣的十二生肖图等。苏州的琢玉闻名于国内外，展品中有重约五十多斤的碧玉蟾蜍，和各种雕刻精美灵巧的小摆设。
    展览会举办期间，每天有人向展览会反映文物古迹的线索，要求政府注意保存。（新华社）
