Show Your “Sharpness” if You Have It, Reveal Your “Wealth” if You Have It
    Kong Sang
    Before agricultural cooperativization, some well-to-do middle peasants had the mentality of being “afraid to stand out” and “afraid to reveal their wealth.” They were clearly rich, but they pretended to be poor in front of everyone; they had excellent production conditions, but they were unwilling to increase production. These thoughts have disappeared or are rare after cooperativization. However, in industrial production and construction, we can often encounter this kind of thinking of “being afraid to stand out” and “being afraid to reveal wealth.” For example, some enterprise leaders clearly know that their enterprises have the conditions to increase production, but they loudly claim to their superiors that they have exhausted their potential; some people clearly know that their enterprises can greatly save raw materials, but they tell their superiors that there is really nothing to save. Furthermore, when the supply of raw materials is tight, the state requires enterprises to adjust to each other and use raw materials rationally. However, many enterprise leaders resort to deception, concealing the quantity of materials in stock, either reporting that they have none when they do, or reporting less than they have, or reporting poor quality when they have good quality. Last winter, as the heating stoves in Beijing were selling out, the state asked the Beijing Third Industrial Bureau to produce stoves quickly. The leaders of this bureau saw that steel materials were in short supply at the time, so they said that they had no materials, and if anyone wanted stoves, they had to exchange materials for them. The state could not allocate materials for a while, and in order to ensure that citizens could buy stoves, it had to reluctantly melt some of the finished steel and iron pipes for stove materials. But did this industrial bureau really have no stove materials at the time? Recently, relevant departments checked the warehouse and proved that this industrial bureau not only had them last winter, but also has several hundred tons accumulated now.
    Some well-to-do middle peasants are afraid of "standing out" and afraid of "revealing wealth" because they do not understand the policy of encouraging the development of production. Some industrial enterprise leaders are afraid of "standing out" and afraid of "revealing wealth" because they are afraid that the state will give them production tasks, or that the state will require them to reduce product costs and increase profits to be turned over to the state, or that the state will take out the surplus materials. In a word, they are afraid of increasing the difficulty of their work and afraid of not being able to complete the task easily. As a result, the difficulties of these enterprises have been reduced, and their work has been eased, but the difficulties of the whole country have increased: less products are controlled, fiscal revenue is also reduced, and the already tight supply of raw materials has become even tighter. In the final analysis, some projects that could have been built more are now built less, and some things that could have been produced more are now produced less.
    The shortage of raw material supply is the main difficulty in industrial production and construction this year. But on the other hand, there is still potential for increasing production and saving raw materials; judging from the recent spot checks of enterprises' warehouses in Liaoning, Jiangsu, Shanxi, Tianjin, Beijing and other provinces and cities, there are still quite a few so-called "black" materials. In a warehouse of the Shenyang Handicraft Industry Administration, which is considered to have the most "miserable" family assets, more than 14,000 cubic meters of unreported timber were found. As long as these "black" raw materials are rationally allocated and used, some difficulties can be overcome. The key is that everyone brings out the "sharpness" of increasing production and saving, reveals the "wealth," and reveals the "sharpness" and "wealth" of stored raw materials, and does not artificially aggravate the tight supply of raw materials.
    Some people say: If you have "sharpness" and "wealth," you will be found out even if you don't expose it yourself. This is very true. Because although some leading organs "sleep soundly" and do not check their own resources, allowing some subordinates who are afraid of "standing out" and afraid of "revealing wealth" to temporarily take advantage of loopholes, most of our leading organs are sober. They will discover your "sharpness" and "wealth" from the account books, from the warehouses, and from the comparison of similar enterprises. I hope that every enterprise can consciously "stand out" and "reveal wealth," and not wait for the superior to come and check.

    有“尖”就冒，有“富”就露
    孔桑
    在农业合作化以前，有些富裕中农有“怕冒尖”、“怕露富”思想。他们明明有钱，却在众人面前装穷；他们有优良的生产条件，却不愿意增加生产。这些思想在合作化以后已经没有或者很少了。但在工业生产和建设中，却还可以常常碰到这种“怕冒尖”、“怕露富”的思想。譬如有些企业领导人，明明知道自己的企业有增产的条件，但在上级面前却大嚷大叫潜力挖尽了；有些人明明知道自己的企业可以大大节约原材料，但在上级面前却说实在没什么可节约的了。又如在原材料供应紧张的时候，国家要求企业之间互相调剂，合理使用原材料，但是，不少企业的领导人却弄虚作假，隐瞒库存材料数量，不是以有报无，就是以多报少，以好报次。去年冬天即将来临的时候，北京市的取暖火炉脱销，国家要求北京市第三工业局赶快生产火炉。这个局的领导人看见当时钢铁材料供不应求，就说自己没有材料，有人要火炉，就必须拿材料来换。国家一时调不出材料来，为了保证市民买到火炉，不得不忍痛把部分制好的钢、铁管子给他们熔化作火炉材料。但是这个工业局当时真的没有火炉材料吗？最近经有关部门检查仓库证明，这个工业局不仅去年冬天有，而且现在还积压着好几百吨。
    有的富裕中农怕“冒尖”，怕“露富”，是因为不懂得鼓励发展生产的政策。有些工业企业领导人怕“冒尖”、怕“露富”，则是因为怕国家给他们生产任务，或者怕国家要求他们降低产品成本，增加上缴利润，或者怕国家把多余的材料拿出来。一句话，就是怕给自己工作增加困难，怕不能轻松地完成任务。结果，这些企业的困难是减少了，工作是轻松了，但是，整个国家的困难却增加了：掌握的产品少了，财政收入也少了，本来就已紧张的原材料供应情况更加紧张了。归根到底，本来可以多建设一些工程的，现在却少建了，本来可以多生产一些东西的，现在却少生产了。
    原材料供应不足，是今年工业生产和建设中的主要困难。但在另一方面，增产和节约原材料的潜力还是有的；从最近辽宁、江苏、山西、天津、北京等省市抽查企业的仓库来看，所谓“黑”材料还不少。在被认为家底最“苦”的沈阳手工业管理局的一个仓库里，也查出了隐报木材一万四千多立方公尺。只要把这些“黑”原材料加以合理调配和使用，就可以克服部分困难。关键在于大家都把增产和节约的“尖”冒出来，把“富”露出来，把储备原材料的“尖”和“富”露出来，不要人为地加重原材料供应紧张的情况。
    有人说：有了“尖”和“富”，自己不暴露也会被查出来的。这话很对。因为虽然有的领导机关“睡大觉”，不摸自己的家底，使一些怕“冒尖”、怕“露富”的下属暂时得以钻空子，但是，我们绝大部分领导机关是清醒的。他们会从账本上，从仓库里，从同类企业的比较中，发现你的“尖”和“富”来。希望每一个企业都能自觉地“冒尖”“露富”，不要等到上级来检查。
