Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 4th – Nineteen state-owned cotton textile factories and three joint state-private cotton textile factories in Shanghai, located close to each other geographically, have recently organized labor force allocation stations by district to transfer workers among themselves, avoiding labor waste.

These twenty-two factories, grouped into the Hudong, Huxi, and Changning District allocation stations according to their proximity, are the first batch of district-based labor force allocation stations established in Shanghai textile factories. The benefit of setting up stations by district is that factories in close proximity can support each other with workers, which not only avoids wasting labor but also prevents workers from being inconvenienced by commuting long distances due to job transfers.

Since the beginning of January, the three stations have each held two or three meetings. At a distribution meeting held by the Huxi station, the No. 1 and No. 2 State-owned Cotton Factories reported a shortage of roving workers. It so happened that the No. 11 State-owned Cotton Factory had surplus roving workers after converting some ordinary spinning frames into high-draft spinning frames last year, so they were transferred to the No. 1 and No. 2 Factories. The Yong'an No. 3 Cotton Textile Factory and the Tongyi Cotton Textile Factory, both joint state-private enterprises, have added more thread spindle equipment this year and need to increase more than sixty plying, winding, and cone workers, which has now been decided to be transferred from nearby state-owned factories.

Before the establishment of district allocation stations, the labor force of each factory was uniformly allocated by the management department. However, Shanghai has more than 300,000 textile workers, which often led to a surplus of workers in one factory while another factory was recruiting temporary workers from society, resulting in a significant waste of labor.

After the Spring Festival, joint state-private textile factories in geographically close areas are also preparing to set up this kind of labor force allocation station.

Xinhua News Agency, Lüda, 4th – Many factories and enterprises in Lüda are arranging their labor force for this year in accordance with the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy, trying their best to increase production and handle more tasks without increasing staff or with few additional staff.

All units are tapping the potential of the existing labor force or adjusting the labor force among enterprises. The production of the Dalian Chemical Plant has increased significantly this year, and manpower seems insufficient. Before the Chinese New Year, they had planned to recruit some new workers. Later, after careful calculation, actively improving labor organization, and rationally arranging the staffing of each production position, not only did the production department not need to increase staff, but it could also train nearly 400 new workers for new enterprises. The factories and mines under the Lüda Industrial Bureau originally planned to increase 1,234 workers in the first quarter of this year. After the Industrial Bureau conducted special research with the factories and mines, they finally reduced the personnel that were dispensable and organized the adjustment of the labor force between factories, resulting in a reduction of more than 500 people compared to the original plan.

Many units are also tapping the potential of the labor force by reducing staffing levels, simplifying procedures and systems, and reducing non-production personnel.

### 根据节约精神合理安排劳动力  上海二十多个棉纺织厂互相调配工人  旅大许多厂争取增产不增人或少增人

    根据节约精神合理安排劳动力
    上海二十多个棉纺织厂互相调配工人  旅大许多厂争取增产不增人或少增人
    新华社上海4日电　上海有十九个地区相近的国营棉纺织厂和三个公私合营棉纺织厂，最近分区组织劳动力调配站，互相调配工人，避免劳动力的浪费。
    这二十二个厂按地区相近分别组成的沪东、沪西和长宁区三个调配站，是上海纺织厂第一批分区成立的劳动力调配站。分区设站的好处，是地区相近的厂互相支援工人，既可以不浪费劳动力，又可以不使工人因工作调动而往返不便。
    从1月初到现在，三个站都分别开过两三次会议。在一次沪西站举行的调配会议上，国棉一厂和二厂反映缺少粗纱工，恰好国棉十一厂去年把一部分普通细纱机改为大牵伸细纱机以后，多出了粗纱工，就调给一厂和二厂。公私合营永安第三棉纺织厂和统益棉纺织厂今年都增添了线锭设备，需要增加六十多个并线、摇纱和筒子工人，现在决定从附近的国营厂调去。
    没有成立区的调配站以前，各厂的劳动力是由管理部门统一调配的。但是上海有三十多万纺织职工，往往形成这个厂工人富余，而另一个厂又向社会招雇临时工，形成劳动力很大的浪费。
    春节过后，地区相近的公私合营纺织厂也准备设立这种劳动力调配站。
    据新华社旅大4日电　旅大市许多工厂、企业正在根据增产节约的精神安排今年的劳动力，尽量做到多增产、多办事，不增加人或少增加人。
    各单位都在进行挖掘现有劳动力的潜力，或者在企业之间互相调剂劳动力。大连化学厂今年的生产有很大提高，人力显得不足，年前他们曾打算招聘一些新工人。后来经过精打细算，积极改善劳动组织，合理安排各个生产岗位的定员以后，不但生产部门不必再增加人，而且还能为新建企业培养近四百名新工人。旅大市工业局所属各厂矿原来计划今年第一季度要增加一千二百三十四名工人，经过工业局同各厂矿进行了专门研究以后，最后削减了可要可不要的人员，同时又组织厂与厂之间调剂了劳动力，结果比原计划减少了五百多人。
    许多单位还从压缩编制，简化手续制度，减少非生产人员等方面来挖掘劳动力的潜力。
