How the Law of Conservation of Parity Was Shaken

By Yu Min, Associate Research Fellow, Institute of Physics

Recently, physicists around the world have been hotly discussing a major scientific discovery: the law of conservation of parity, which has been considered one of the unquestionable basic laws of physics since the creation of quantum mechanics thirty years ago, has been shaken by two Chinese-American theoretical physicists, Professor Li Zhengdao and Professor Yang Zhenning. Inspired by some experimental facts, Professor Li Zhengdao and Professor Yang Zhenning boldly proposed the concept that parity is not conserved in weak interactions last summer. After about half a year, this concept was first experimentally confirmed by Professor Wu Jianxiong (female), an atomic nuclear physicist. From 1957 onwards, physicists will consider various important theoretical issues with a new inspiration. It is still impossible to estimate what important role it will play in people's understanding of the laws of the microscopic world.

The Law of Conservation of Parity

In the eyes of physicists, if one physical process is a mirror image of another, then they always proceed in the same way. Our universe seems to be eternally symmetrical with respect to left and right. For example:

As shown in Figure 1, if a beam of protons with spins aligned along the z-direction strikes a target in the x-axis direction, then the number of protons scattered onto the xy-plane must be equal to the number scattered below the xy-plane, because these two processes are mirror image physical processes with the xy-plane as the mirror. This is the basic meaning of the law of parity. From the day it was born, this law seemed to never show any reason to be doubted, and the conclusions built on this law were always confirmed thousands of times by experiments. Therefore, physicists naturally regarded it as one of the basic laws of nature.

When people look for the laws of the microscopic world, especially the laws of motion of elementary particles, they always take it as one of the pointers. Although theories about elementary particles have encountered many difficulties, no one has ever suspected whether the law of parity is causing trouble. Although incorrect prejudices can obscure people for a while, they will be discovered sooner or later as understanding deepens. Research on κ-mesons first reminded people to consider the issue of parity more deeply.

Inspiration from κ-mesons

κ-mesons are a collective term for heavy mesons, one of which decays into two π-mesons, called θ-mesons, and another decays into three π-mesons, called τ-mesons. Except for the different decay modes, θ and τ mesons have no other differences in their physical properties. Thus, people naturally guessed that θ and τ were originally one kind of κ-meson, and θ and τ were just two decay modes of this meson. However, further analysis revealed that this view is contrary to the law of conservation of parity. Because after analyzing the experimental results, it can be concluded that the parity of the two-π-meson system decayed from the θ-meson is positive, while the parity of the three-π-meson system decayed from the τ-meson is negative. This was indeed a rather confusing issue. If θ and τ mesons, as the law of parity tells us, are not the same kind of meson, then why are their properties so similar? Is this just a coincidence? Many physicists hotly discussed this issue. Some physicists have also guessed whether parity would not be conserved in the decay of κ-mesons. From the traditional concept accepted by everyone, this concept is unimaginable. However, Professor Li Zhengdao and Professor Yang Zhenning were not bound by traditional prejudices, and they boldly put forward this hypothesis.

The Li-Yang Hypothesis

Li Zhengdao and Yang Zhenning pointed out that parity may not be conserved in the weak interactions between elementary particles. This naturally solves the problem of the two decay modes of κ-mesons, because the decay of κ-mesons is caused by the weak interaction between κ and π mesons. In the past, physicists believed that the law of conservation of parity seemed to be a basic law that had been tested thousands of times by experiments. Isn't the experimental fact the most convincing evidence for the conservation of parity? However, after analyzing the past experimental evidence, Professor Li and Yang pointed out: it can be clearly seen that existing experiments have indeed quite accurately proved that parity is conserved in strong interactions and electromagnetic interactions, while in weak interactions, the concept of parity conservation is, so far, only an extended hypothesis, and there is no experimental evidence to support it. Thinking that parity conservation is also beyond doubt in weak interactions is just an inherited prejudice. Professor Li and Yang correctly distinguished the truth based on experimental facts from people's unconscious inherited prejudices, laying the foundation for a major discovery.

Experimental Confirmation

The θ and τ decay phenomena inspired the concept of non-conservation of parity in weak interactions, but it is not strong evidence, because we cannot be sure that θ and τ are the same kind of meson. Professor Li and Yang further proposed some experiments to test whether the law of parity is correct in weak interactions. One of them, first confirmed by Professor Wu Jianxiong, is the experiment of whether the number of electrons emitted to both ends is symmetrical in the β decay of cobalt-60. As shown in Figure 2, if the spin of the cobalt-60 nucleus is aligned in a certain direction, then if the law of conservation of parity is correct, the number of electrons emitted to both sides of cobalt-60 should be the same. Therefore, as long as we measure the number of electrons emitted in the direction of spin and against the direction of spin, we can determine whether the law of parity is correct. To align the spin of the cobalt-60 nucleus in one direction, the cobalt-60 must be cooled to extremely low temperatures, which is a very difficult experiment. Professor Wu Jianxiong successfully carried out this experiment with the help of other physicists. They cooled cobalt-60 to an absolute temperature of 0.01° (-273.1°C); at such a low temperature, thermal disturbances almost stopped. At this time, with a strong magnetic field applied, the nuclei of cobalt-60 were aligned along the direction of the magnetic field like small magnets. The temperature does not affect the β decay process. Wu Jianxiong et al. used scintillation counters to measure the number of electrons emitted to both sides and found that the number of electrons was not equal. Wu Jianxiong was the first to confirm the views of Professor Li and Yang.

Another experiment proposed by Professor Li and Yang that has been confirmed is the decay of π-mesons - μ-mesons and μ-mesons - electrons. This experiment has also been confirmed by Associate Professor Lidman of Columbia University and others. The law of conservation of parity has been proven to be inapplicable in weak interactions, and it has been degraded from the position of a basic law applicable to all microscopic phenomena to a law only applicable to strong interactions and electromagnetic interactions.

For those who are engaged in basic particle research, the law of conservation of parity has always been a signpost in the past, and people follow the direction it indicates to find the law. Now that this signpost has been destroyed, the thinking of physicists has been liberated. Inspired by this important work of Li, Yang, and others, many interesting ideas and conjectures will surely develop; but we do not yet know where the truly correct direction lies.

Professor Li and Yang also put forward some interesting ideas in their published article (October 1956, Volume 104, Issue 1 of the American Physical Review). They said that the observed left-right asymmetry of elementary particles may not mean that reflection really has no invariance. Perhaps in addition to elementary particles with this left-right asymmetry, there are corresponding elementary particles with opposite left-right asymmetry. However, on the planet we live on, the number of one kind of particle must be greater than the other, otherwise asymmetry would not be observed in some of the experiments mentioned above. The existence of another kind of particle will produce very interesting results. However, this interesting idea and many other interesting ideas are still in the speculation stage. Due to the inspiration of this important work, we believe that the physics community will present a lively scene in the near future.

[Editor's Note] Mesons are unstable elementary particles whose mass is between the mass of an electron and a nucleon (neutron and proton). The mass of a μ-meson is about 207 times the mass of an electron, and the mass of a π-meson is about 273 times the mass of an electron. They are lighter mesons. κ-mesons are the collective term for heavier mesons with a mass of about 966 times the mass of an electron. Mesons can be positively charged or negatively charged, and the charge they carry is equal to that carried by an electron. There are also uncharged mesons. The process in which unstable atomic nuclei and elementary particles are transformed into other atomic nuclei and elementary particles is called decay. β decay refers to the decay process in which electrons are emitted.

    宇称守恒定律是怎样被动摇的
    物理研究所副研究员　于敏
    近来在世界各国物理学家中，热烈地讨论着一件科学上的重大发现：从三十年前量子力学创立之日起，一直被认为是无可怀疑的物理学的基本定律之一——宇称守恒定律，已经被我国留美理论物理学家李政道、杨振宁二位教授予以动摇。李政道、杨振宁二位教授在一些实验事实的启示下，在去年夏天大胆地提出了宇称在弱相互作用中不守恒的观念，经过了大约半年之久，这种观念首先被原子核物理学家吴健雄（女）副教授从实验上证实。从1957年起，物理学家们将在一种新的启示下去考虑各种重大的理论问题。今天还无法估计它将在人们对于微观世界规律的认识上起着什么样的重要作用。
    宇称守恒定律
    在物理学家的心目中，在两个物理过程中，如果其中一个过程是另外一个的镜像过程的话，那么它们总是同样进行的。我们的宇宙好像对于左和右永远是对称的。举一个例子来说：
    如图一所表明的，有一束自旋沿着z方向的质子，顺着x轴方向打在靶子上，那么被靶子散射到xy面上的质子数一定和散射到xy面下的质子数相等，因为这两个过程是以xy面为镜面的镜像物理过程。这就是宇称定律的基本义意。这一条定律从它诞生之日起，好像从未表现出来有任何值得怀疑的地方，建筑在这个定律上面的结论总是千百次地被实验所证实。因此，物理学家们很自然地认为它是自然界的基本规律之一。
    当人们寻找微观世界规律，尤其是基本粒子运动规律的时候，总是拿它作为指针之一。有关基本粒子的理论虽然遇到了极多的困难，却没有人怀疑过是不是宇称定律在给人们带来麻烦。不正确的成见虽然可以使人们蒙蔽一时，但是随着认识的深入迟早是会被发现的。关于κ介子的研究工作第一次提醒人们应当更深刻地考虑关于宇称问题。
    来自κ介子的启示
    κ介子是重介子的统称，其中一种衰变为两个π介子的叫做θ介子，另一种衰变为三个π介子的叫做τ介子。θ和τ介子除了衰变方式不同外，其他的物理性质是没有什么区别的。这样人们很自然地猜想θ和τ本来是一种κ介子，θ和τ只是这种介子的两种衰变方式。但是进一步的分析发现这样的观点是与宇称守恒定律相矛盾的。因为分析实验结果后可以得出结论，θ介子衰变成的两个π介子系的宇称是正的，而τ介子衰变成的三个π介子系的宇称是负的。这确实是一个相当使人困惑的问题。如果说θ和τ介子像宇称定律所告诉我们的那样，并不是一种介子，那么为什么它们的性质如此相近呢？难道说这只是一种偶然的巧合吗？很多物理学家热烈地讨论着这一问题。有一些物理学家也曾猜想到是不是在κ介子衰变中宇称会不守恒呢，从大家所接受的传统观念看起来，这个观念是难以想像的。可是李政道、杨振宁二位教授却不为传统的成见所束缚，他们大胆地提出了这个假说。
    李—杨假说
    李政道、杨振宁指出，在基本粒子间的弱相互作用中宇称可能是不守恒的，这样就很自然地解决了κ介子的两种衰变方式问题，因为κ介子的衰变是通过κ、π介子间的弱相互作用引起的。在物理学家过去的心目中，宇称守恒定律似乎是经过千百次实验检验过的基本定律，难道说实验事实还不是宇称守恒的最有说服力的证据吗？但是，李、杨二位教授对过去的实验证据加以分析后指出：可以很清楚地看到，现有的实验确实相当精确地证明了在强相互作用和电磁相互作用中宇称是守恒的，而在弱相互作用中，宇称守恒观念到目前为止，仅仅是一个推广的假设，并没有任何实验证据能支持它。认为宇称守恒在弱相互作用中也无可怀疑，只是一种因袭的成见。李、杨二位教授正确地区分开建筑在实验事实基础上的真理，和人们不自觉的因袭的成见，奠定了重大发现的基础。
    实验的证实
    θ、τ衰变现象启发了在弱相互作用中宇称不守恒的观念，但是它还不是一个有力的证据，因为我们还不能肯定θ和τ是同一种介子。李、杨二位教授进一步提出了检验在弱相互作用中宇称定律是否正确的一些实验。其中被吴健雄副教授首先证实的一个是在钴60β衰变中向两端所发射的电子数目是否对称的实验。如图二所表示的，将钴60原子核的自旋顺着一定方向排列起来，如果宇称守恒定律是正确的话，那末向钴60两边发射出去的电子的数目应当是同样的。所以，我们只要测量了顺着自旋方向和反着自旋方向发射的电子数，就可以确定宇称定律是否正确了。要想把钴60原子核自旋沿着一个方向排列起来，必须把钴60冷却到极低的温度，这是一个很困难的实验。吴健雄副教授在其他物理学家的帮助下，成功地进行了这个实验。他们把钴60冷却到绝对温度0.01°（—273.1℃）；在这样低的温度下，热扰动几乎停止，这时加上很强的磁场，钴60的原子核便像一个一个小磁铁一样延着磁场方向排列起来。温度不会影响β衰变过程。吴健雄等用闪烁计数器测量了向两边发射的电子数，发现电子数目是不相等的。吴健雄第一个证实了李、杨二教授的看法。
    另外一个已被证实的李、杨二教授所提出来的实验，是关于π介子—μ介子和μ介子—电子的衰变的。这一实验也已被哥伦比亚大学的利德曼副教授等所证实。宇称守恒定律已被证明在弱相互作用中是不适用的，它已从一个适用于一切微观现象的基本定律的地位下降为只适用于强相互作用和电磁相互作用的一个规律。
    对于做基本粒子研究工作的人，在过去宇称守恒定律一直是一块指路标，人们顺着它所指示的方向去寻找规律。现在这块路标被破坏了，物理学家的思想得到了解放。在李、杨等这一重要的工作的启示下，一定会发展出很多有兴趣的观念和猜想；但是真正正确的方向在那里，我们现在还不知道。
    李、杨二位教授在他们所发表的文章中（1956年10月美国物理评论第一○四卷第一期），也曾提出了一些有兴趣的观念。他们说所观测到的基本粒子的左右不对称性，也许并不表示反射真的就没有不变性了，也许除了具有这种左右不对称性的基本粒子外，还有相应的具有相反的左右不对称的基本粒子存在。不过在我们所居住的星球上，一种粒子的数目一定要比另一种多，不然在上面提到的一些实验中就不会观测到不对称了。另一种粒子的存在会产生很有意思的结果。不过这种有兴趣的观念和其他很多有兴趣的观念还都在猜测阶段。由于这一重要工作的启示，我们相信在最近将来物理学界将呈现活跃景象。
    〔编者注〕介子是一些不稳定的基本粒子，它们的质量介于电子的质量和核子（中子和质子）之间。μ介子的质量约为电子质量的二○七倍，π介子的质量约为电子质量的二七三倍，它们是较轻的介子。κ介子是较重的介子的总称，质量约为电子质量的九六六倍。介子有带正电的，也有带负电的，所带的电与电子所带的相等。也有不带电的介子。不稳定的原子核、基本粒子变成别的原子核、基本粒子的过程，叫做衰变。β衰变就是指放射出电子的衰变过程。（附图片）
