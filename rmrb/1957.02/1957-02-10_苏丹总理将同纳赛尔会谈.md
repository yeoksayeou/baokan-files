Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, February 9th: Sudanese Prime Minister Khalil said on the 7th that he would soon meet with Egyptian President Nasser in Wadi Halfa, on the border between Egypt and Sudan.

Khalil said during an interview with a reporter from the Egyptian newspaper "Al-Ahram" that the purpose of the meeting was "to discuss some issues and reach understandings, and to strengthen the relations between the two sister countries." He also said that the relationship between Sudan and Egypt is very close and friendly, and that a Sudanese military delegation is preparing to depart for Egypt to receive further training.

When Khalil spoke about US President Eisenhower's Middle East plan, he said that his government has not given it any consideration so far. He said, "We don't know the details." He said that once the Eisenhower Plan is passed by the US Senate, "Sudan will not take a separate position on this issue, but will consult with the governments of the Arab sister countries and then express its attitude."

When asked about the purpose of his upcoming trip to Iraq, the Sudanese Prime Minister said: "The Iraqi government that extended the invitation should know (the purpose). As for me, I accepted the invitation with the desire to strengthen relations between the two countries."

He said that Israeli troops must withdraw behind the 1949 armistice line in accordance with UN resolutions. If Israel refuses to withdraw, the United Nations should force it to do so.

    新华社开罗9日电　苏丹总理哈利勒7日说，他不久将在埃及和苏丹交界的瓦的哈尔法同埃及总统纳赛尔举行会谈。
    哈利勒在接见埃及“金字塔报”记者时说，会谈的目的是“就一些问题进行商议和取得谅解，并且加强两个姊妹国家间的关系”。他又说，苏丹同埃及的关系是非常密切和友好的，苏丹的军事代表团正在准备动身来埃及接受进一步的训练。
    哈利勒在谈到美国艾森豪威尔的中东计划时说，他的政府到目前为止对它还没有给予任何考虑。他说：“我们并不知道细节”。他说，艾森豪威尔计划一旦为美国参议院通过了的话，“苏丹在这个问题上将不会采取单独的立场，而是将同阿拉伯姊妹国家政府商议，然后表明它的态度。”
    这位苏丹总理在回答关于他即将进行的伊拉克之行的目的这个问题时说：“提出邀请的伊拉克政府应当晓得（这个目的）。至于我，我是怀着加强两国间关系的意愿而接受邀请的。”
    他说，以色列军队必须按照联合国决议撤退到1949年停战线后面。如果以色列拒绝撤退，联合国应当强迫它这样做。
