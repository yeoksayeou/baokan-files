Beijing News: Regarding the incident of Redland, a British teacher at Chongde Middle School, insulting students, the Beijing Student Federation sent a letter yesterday (12th) to all students of Chongde Middle School, denouncing Redland's crimes and supporting the school's students' just actions. The original letter is as follows:

    Chongde Middle School students:

    Following the Fu Jen Catholic University incident, imperialist element Redland has once again insulted you, insulting all the students in the city. We, on behalf of all students in the city, firmly support your just actions.

    Imperialists say we are "dirty," but we say: imperialists themselves are the most despicable. For thousands of years, we have been working diligently and living on our own land, while imperialists use airplanes and cannons to kill us, massacre other weak nations, and plunder other people's blood and sweat to increase their profits. This is the most vile, filthy, and inhuman thing in the world.

    From Redland's crimes, all of us students in the city are even more clearly aware that imperialists are extremely reactionary, unwilling to accept the victory of the Chinese people, and are our enemies with whom we can never compromise.

    Today, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Chinese people have stood up and established the People's Republic of China. Our lives and freedom are guaranteed. We must cherish our motherland, unite international friends, adhere to the people's democratic dictatorship, and shatter all the conspiracies and atrocities of imperialism.

    Beijing Student Federation, November 12th

[Our Dispatch] The Peking University Student Union recently sent a letter to the students of Chongde Middle School, stating in the letter: "We, all the students of Peking University, express our infinite indignation at the fact that Redland, a British English teacher, dared to insult our Chongde students. On the land of the people's motherland after liberation, no imperialist is allowed to have any barbaric and rude behavior. We protest against this shameful behavior of the imperialists, and we will resolutely support you in filing a lawsuit with the people's court, and express our greatest sympathy to Comrade Lu Zuyi of your school."

    抗议芮德兰暴行
    致函声援崇德中学同学
    【北京讯】北京市学生联合会就崇德中学英籍教员芮德兰侮辱同学事，昨（十二）日致函崇德中学全体同学，斥责芮德兰的罪行，支援该校同学的正义行动。原函如下：
    崇德中学的同学们：
    在辅仁中学事件以后，帝国主义分子芮德兰再一次侮辱了你们，侮辱了全市的同学。我们谨代表全市同学坚决支援你们的正义行动。
    帝国主义者说我们“脏”，我们说：帝国主义者自己才是最龌龊的。几千年来，我们在自己的国土上勤劳地工作着、生活着，而帝国主义者却用飞机大炮来杀我们，屠杀其他弱小民族，掠夺别人的血汗，增加他们的利润，这才是世界上最卑鄙肮脏、最没有人性的东西。
    从芮德兰的罪行中，我们全市的同学们都是更清楚的认识到：帝国主义者是极端反动的，对于中国人民的胜利是不甘心的，是我们永远不能妥协的敌人。
    今天在毛主席的领导下，中国人民已经站立起来了，建立了中华人民共和国，我们的生命、自由都有了保障。我们要爱护我们的祖国，团结国际友人，坚持人民民主专政，粉碎帝国主义的一切阴谋暴行。
    北京市学生联合会十一月十二日
    【本报讯】北京大学学生会顷函崇德中学同学，信内说：“对于英籍英文教员芮德兰胆敢辱骂我崇德同学，我们全体北大同学都表示无限的愤慨。在解放后的人民祖国的土地上，不容许任何帝国主义者有任何蛮横无礼的行为，我们抗议帝国主义者这种可耻的行为，决全力支援你们向人民法院起诉，并对贵校卢祖翼同学表示最大的慰问。”
