Provisional Measures for Handling Labor-Capital Relations

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 25th: "Provisional Measures for Handling Labor-Capital Relations."

	Article 1: These measures are formulated to implement the economic and labor policies of "developing production, promoting economic prosperity, taking into account both public and private interests, and benefiting both labor and capital."

	Article 2: These measures apply to all private industrial and commercial enterprises.

	Article 3: The relationship between private business owners (hereinafter referred to as the capital side) and the employed workers, staff, shop assistants, apprentices, and miscellaneous personnel (hereinafter referred to as the labor side), if not stipulated in these measures, may be agreed upon by both labor and capital sides and stipulated in a collective contract or labor contract. However, the collective contract or labor contract shall not contradict the content of these measures.

	Note: A collective contract is a written contract for a certain period of time that stipulates the rights and obligations of both labor and capital sides. Labor and capital sides in the same industry may conclude a general collective contract for the same industry or sector. Labor and capital sides in a factory or enterprise may also conclude a separate collective contract. A labor contract is a contract that stipulates the specific labor conditions of a part of the laborers or a certain laborer and the capital side in a certain factory or enterprise.

	Article 4: The labor side has the freedom and right to participate in trade unions and all political and social activities, and the capital side shall not restrict it. The labor side has the freedom to be employed and terminated, and the capital side shall not force the labor side to be employed. If the labor side resigns midway, it shall be handled according to the provisions in the collective contract and labor contract; if there are no provisions, the capital side shall be notified five days before resignation.

	Article 5: The management rules of each industrial and commercial enterprise and the work rules of the workplace shall be formulated by the capital side, agreed upon by the trade union, and submitted to the labor bureau of the people's government for the record. The labor side shall earnestly abide by them. If there is any violation of the above rules, the capital side has the right to impose sanctions or dismiss them according to the provisions in the rules. The management rules of each industrial and commercial enterprise and the work rules of the workplace shall not contradict the laws and regulations promulgated by the people's government and the collective contracts signed by both labor and capital sides.

	Article 6: The capital side has the right to hire and dismiss workers and staff for the needs of production or work. If there are provisions in the collective contract and labor contract for the capital side to dismiss workers and staff, it shall be handled according to the provisions; if there are no provisions, the labor side shall be notified ten days before dismissal, and a certain amount of severance pay shall be given to the labor side. The amount of severance pay shall be determined according to the business conditions of the factory or enterprise and the length of service of the employees in the enterprise, but shall not be less than half a month's actual salary and shall not exceed three months' actual salary. However, seasonal workers, temporary workers, and those dismissed due to the fault of the workers and staff are not subject to this provision.

	Article 7: If the trade union believes that the capital side's punishment and dismissal of workers and staff are unreasonable, it has the right to protest to the capital side. If the capital side does not accept the protest, it shall be handled in accordance with the procedures for resolving labor disputes in Article 27 of these measures.

	Article 8: All factories and shops that have started work and resumed business must strive to operate; those that have not started work and resumed business or have not fully started work and resumed business must strive to start work and resume business. If it is impossible to start work and resume business or must close down or change business due to insurmountable difficulties, it must apply to the people's government for approval.

	Article 9: When the capital side resumes business and recruits employees in newly liberated cities, employees who were dismissed for participating in revolutionary political activities should be reinstated first; other original employees who were dismissed within six months before liberation should be given priority for employment or gradually re-employed; however, those who were dismissed for fault are not subject to this provision.

	Article 10: When the capital side recruits original employees, it must adopt the method of written notice and newspaper notice. The original employees must report to the company within ten days after receiving the written notice (those who have not received the written notice, within half a month from the date of publication in the newspaper) and go to work in the factory on time, otherwise it will be regarded as abandonment. When the original employees are not enough to meet the needs of resumption of work, the capital side may recruit new employees; however, when the capital side has not added new employees, the original employees generally shall not make a request for mandatory resumption of work.

	Article 11: When the capital side has been approved by the government to suspend work or close down, if it is unable to repay the wages owed to employees and dismissal fees or other debts, it must report to the labor bureau, and the labor bureau shall convene labor and capital sides to negotiate a reasonable solution. The capital side's houses, machines, raw materials, furniture, etc. shall not be directly handed over to the labor side or the trade union for handling. The labor side and the trade union shall not take over and distribute the above-mentioned property on their own.

	Article 12: The daily working time of employees shall be eight to ten hours in principle. If it is necessary to increase or shorten it due to production needs or production departments that are harmful to the health of employees, it may be agreed upon by both labor and capital sides. However, the extension of working hours shall not exceed twelve hours per day at most. The working hours and holidays of artisans, shop assistants, apprentices, and general miscellaneous personnel shall generally follow the old practices. However, if the working hours are too long and affect the health of employees, they shall be appropriately shortened.

	Article 13: Holidays for the New Year and memorial days shall be in accordance with the regulations of the people's government if there are any, and in accordance with the customs if there are no regulations. Rest days and personal leave shall be handled temporarily according to the old practices of each enterprise. If there is any unreasonableness, the labor and capital sides shall agree on it in the collective contract when signing the collective contract.

	Article 14: The labor side's participation in trade union meetings and other entertainment and education activities shall not take up production time. If the responsible cadres of the trade union organization in the factory need to take up production time, they must obtain the consent of the capital side, but it shall not exceed two working days per month on average, and the wages shall be paid as usual. If employees are elected as people's representatives or group representatives to participate in meetings according to the instructions of the Municipal Military Control Commission and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the wages during the participation in the meetings shall be paid by the organ or group that convenes the meeting.

	Article 15: In newly liberated cities, the capital side must maintain the average level of actual wages of employees in the three months before liberation and shall not reduce it. At the same time, in enterprises that are currently underdeveloped in production or business and have low profits, actual wages should generally not be increased. If the wages were too low or too high before liberation, the labor and capital sides may negotiate to increase or decrease them appropriately when signing the collective contract, but it shall be effective only after being approved by the local people's government labor bureau.

	Note: The actual wages referred to in these measures include the food, subsidies, and other benefits given by the capital side, and the total income of employees calculated in kind.

	Article 16: Wages should be paid twice a month.

	Article 19: All male and female employees who have the same skills, do the same work, and have the same effect shall receive the same remuneration.

	Article 20: Enterprises that have existing habits of providing employees with food and accommodation, profit sharing, gifts, and other rewards shall maintain the old practices. If there is any unreasonableness, the labor and capital sides shall negotiate and modify it in the collective contract.

	Article 22: Apprentices and trainees and the person who imparts technical or business knowledge (that is, the master) shall strictly abide by the principle of respecting teachers and loving apprentices. Learners shall study diligently and work hard to produce, and those who impart knowledge shall impart knowledge wholeheartedly. Beating, scolding, and abuse are prohibited.

	Article 23: The rest period for female workers and female staff before and after childbirth and the breastfeeding time for infants shall be handled according to the original regulations if there are any. If there are no regulations or the regulations are too few, it shall be stipulated that the rest period before and after childbirth shall be 45 days in total; miscarriage: 15 days of rest for pregnancy within three months, and 30 days of rest for pregnancy over three months, and wages shall be paid as usual. Breastfeeding infants every four hours, 15 to 25 minutes each time.

	Article 24: The existing employee welfare facilities of each enterprise shall generally remain the same, and those that have not been established may be gradually established by the capital side depending on its economic strength. If an employee is injured or dies due to work, the capital side shall pay wages during the medical treatment period and bear the medical expenses. If an employee is disabled or dies due to work-related injuries, the capital side shall provide a certain amount of consolation money, and the amount shall be stipulated by both labor and capital sides in the collective contract. The treatment during the sick leave of employees and the compensation for the death of employees due to illness shall be handled according to the old regulations of each enterprise. If there are no such regulations or the regulations are too low, they may be stipulated by both labor and capital sides in the collective contract.

	Article 25: When labor and capital sides sign a collective contract, a general collective contract shall be signed by each industry. Each enterprise and factory may sign a separate collective contract based on the general collective contract. The general collective contract shall be negotiated and signed by the trade union representatives of the labor side of each industry (representatives elected by the employee representative meeting of the industry when the trade union has not been established) and the representatives elected by the members of the same industry association of the capital side on the basis of voluntary equality. This general collective contract shall be approved by the labor bureau of the people's government. All labor and capital sides in the industry who participate in the signing of the collective contract shall abide by it. After the general contract is signed, the labor and capital of each enterprise in the industry can sign a separate collective contract according to the general contract. If there are special issues not included in the general collective contract, supplementary provisions can be made in the separate collective contract of the enterprise, but the supplementary provisions shall not contradict the content of the general collective contract and must be agreed upon by the trade union organization and the same industry association of the industry. The detailed methods for signing collective contracts shall be stipulated separately by the labor bureau.

	Article 26: If employees of each enterprise make requests to the capital side without signing a collective contract or outside the collective contract, they shall be reviewed by the industry trade union and the municipal federation of trade unions in advance, and the industry trade union and the municipal federation of trade unions shall send people to meet with the employee representatives of the industry to negotiate with the capital side or the industry association of the capital side. An agreement shall be reached through equal consultation, and both labor and capital sides shall abide by it.

	Article 27: When a labor dispute occurs in a certain enterprise and the labor and capital sides fail to reach a consensus, the labor and capital sides shall request the representatives sent by the industry trade union and the same industry association to jointly negotiate and resolve the dispute with the parties concerned. If they still fail to reach a consensus, either party may request the local people's government labor bureau to mediate. If mediation is invalid, the labor bureau shall organize an arbitration committee for arbitration. Before the consultation, mediation, and arbitration are established, both parties shall maintain the status quo of production. The capital side shall not take measures such as closing the factory, suspending wages, suspending food, or other reductions in treatment; the labor side shall also produce as usual and abide by labor discipline. If either party of the labor and capital sides is dissatisfied with the arbitration of the labor bureau, they may file a complaint with the court in accordance with judicial procedures. The court shall make a judgment. Before the court makes a judgment, both parties shall comply with the decision of the labor bureau's arbitration.

	Article 28: Labor disputes shall be resolved in accordance with the procedures stipulated in the above article. Neither party shall take coercive actions such as personal insults against the other party.
