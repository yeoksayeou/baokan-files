　　Jiaotong University Tangshan College Teachers and Students Unite
　　Carry out a Movement to Respect Teachers and Love Students
　　Professors Who Connect with Students Receive Special Respect
　　[Reported by this newspaper] Over a thousand teachers and students at Tangshan Engineering College of China Jiaotong University are engaged in a movement to respect teachers and love students. Under the Student Union’s call for "Respecting Teachers, Loving Students, Unity, and Mutual Assistance," the Civil Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Architecture, and Mechanical Engineering societies successively held teacher-student social gatherings. This movement has established new relationships between teachers and students at Tangshan College.
　　In the past, there was a deep gap between professors and students. Professors often did not adequately consider the students' level of understanding and rarely adopted students' suggestions to improve teaching methods. Students, dissatisfied and with their opinions unheeded, passively attended classes, creating a rift between teachers and students.
　　Since liberation, everyone has recognized the irrationality of the old education system and that kind of teacher-student relationship, and has actively adopted many methods to eliminate the estrangement between teachers and students. Especially after this movement to respect teachers and love students, the ideological toxins causing disunity between teachers and students have been cleared away. Through discussion meetings in various department-level groups and teacher-student gatherings in various classes and departments, everyone, under the guidance of the New Democratic cultural and educational policy, is jointly and actively reforming teaching methods, giving full play to the spirit of mutual learning and mutual assistance between teachers and students. The students are determined to guarantee the victorious completion of their learning tasks. The Class Committee of the third year of the Civil Engineering Department also put forward six promises: 1. Not to be late for class; 2. To stand up to show respect when class begins and ends; 3. Not to ask questions randomly during class; 4. Even when the bell rings to end the class, not to rush to pack books and stationery before the professor finishes; 5. To minimize questions during the ten-minute break to allow the teacher to rest; 6. To first discuss problems within the group, and if they cannot be solved, then ask the professor or teaching assistant for help. This approach makes the relationship between teachers and students closer.
　　During this movement, the first-year students of the Mechanical Engineering Department and the first-year students of the Chemical Engineering Department expressed special respect to the professors they admired. Professor Guang Kaimin, who teaches physics, and Professor Yang Rongbao, who teaches calculus, have only been with the new students for a month, but they have already been deeply loved and respected by the students. When Professor Guang learned that the students' levels were uneven, he changed to using the simplest examples and repeatedly explained them, so that students with good grades could review more deeply, and students with weaker levels could fully understand and catch up quickly. At the same time, Professor Guang's spirit of learning is also deeply admired by the students. In order to seek more materials to enrich the new teaching content, he is often busy until late at night before he can fall asleep. Professor Yang is particularly loved by the students not only because his teaching is detailed and his explanations are systematic, giving students clear concepts, but also because he is willing to accept students' opinions and seek improvement. He once said, "Whenever and wherever you meet me, you can give me your opinions, and I will humbly accept them. If you encounter any difficulties, you can also talk to me, and I will not be annoyed." Russian professor Zhang Bo has received consistent respect from students throughout the school. He is enthusiastic and responsible. In addition to teaching nine hours of regular classes, he also teaches courses for the Tangshan Municipal Committee. This time, the fourth-year students of the Civil Engineering Department went to Beidaihe for a month of surveying practice and then went to Dalian to visit the Industrial Exhibition for ten days. After returning, they could not keep up with the class. Knowing that Professor Zhang was too busy, they found it difficult to ask for extra lessons. But as soon as Professor Zhang found out, he immediately agreed to give extra lessons in the evening. This spirit of enthusiastic teaching regardless of his own fatigue deeply moved every student, and they all shouted, "Study hard and repay the teacher with our actions!"

　　交大唐院师生大团结
  　开展尊师爱生运动
    联系同学的教授受到特别尊敬
    【本报讯】中国交通大学唐山工学院千余师生卷入尊师爱生运动。在学生会“尊师爱生团结互助”的号召下，尊师爱生周中，土木、电机、建筑、机械等学会，相继举行了师生联欢会，经过这次运动，使唐院师生间建立起新的关系。
    过去教授与同学间有着一道很深的鸿沟。教授多不能很好顾及同学的接受程度，也很少采纳同学的意见以改进教授法；同学则在不满意和意见未被采纳的情况下，消极的刷课，造成了师生间隔阂。
    解放以后，大家都认识了旧教育制度和那种师生关系的不合理，主动地采用许多办法，来消除师生间的隔阂，尤其经过这次尊师爱生运动之后，清除了师生间造成不团结的思想毒素，通过各系级小组的讨论会和各班各系的师生联欢会，大家都在新民主主义文化教育政策的指导下，共同积极改革教学方法，发挥了师生间互学互助的精神，同学们决保证胜利的完成学习任务。土木系三年级的班会，并提出了六项诺言：一、上课不迟到；二、上课下课时起立以示敬意；三、上课时不乱发问；四、虽闻下课铃声，但在教授未作结束前，不焦急整理书籍文具；五、下课十分钟内少发问，让教师休息；六、有问题先经小组讨论，不能解决时，再请教教授助教解决。这种作法使师生关系更趋亲密。
    这次运动中、机械系一年级、化工系一年级对自己爱戴的教授，特别表示了敬意。教物理的光开敏教授、教微积分的杨荣宝教授和新同学相处虽仅一月光景，却已深深受到同学们的爱戴和尊敬。当光教授知道同学们水准不齐时，便改用最浅的例子，反复的讲解，这样使成绩好的同学更能深入复习，程度较差的同学可以完全接受，迅速的赶上去。同时，光教授的好学精神，也深为同学们所钦佩。他为了寻求更多的材料以充实新的教学内容，经常是忙到深夜才能入睡。杨教授之所以为同学们格外敬爱，不仅是因为教学详尽，讲解有系统，能给与同学明确的概念，最使同学觉得难能可贵的是他肯接受同学们的意见，求改进，他曾说：“无论何时何地，只要碰到我，就可向我提意见，我是会虚心接受的。假若你们遇到任何疑难，也可以和我谈，我不会厌烦的。“俄文教授张渤，受到了全校同学一致敬爱，他热心负责，除了担任九小时的正课外，在唐山市委方面也担任了课，这次土木系四年级同学去北戴河测量实习一月，又去大连参观工展十天，回来后跟不上班，又知道张教授太忙，想补课又难于开口，但一经张教授知道，便立刻应允在晚上补课，这种不顾自己疲劳热心教学的精神，深深感动了每个同学，一致喊出：“努力学习，用行动来回报先生。”
