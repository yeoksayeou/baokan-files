　　Some Opinions on Collective Learning
    Su Xing
    Collective learning methods are more effective than purely individual learning methods – this has been proven by experience. However, I have recently learned that some units and groups have experienced some deviations in collective discussions. Here are a few opinions based on what I have seen.
    I once saw a schedule for political study in a unit: lectures during the day, informal talks in groups in the evening, preparation of outlines the next morning, and group discussions in the morning. This cycle repeated every two days. When I went to participate in a group discussion, I saw the following situation: At the beginning, everyone was silent. When they spoke, their opinions were repetitive, not in-depth, without debate, and they took turns speaking stiffly. After that, the chairman made a conclusion, and it ended. And this conclusion equated the relationship between workers and the bourgeoisie with the relationship with peasants, and there was no dissent. After the meeting, a classmate told me: "We heard the same thing in class, and we read very few reference books. Everyone's speeches mainly restated what the teacher said, so there were no differences. When we encounter new problems, we can't figure them out."
    "Can't you find more materials to clarify this issue?" I asked.
    He said, "Because the time has already been allocated."
    I also participated in the study of a group of cadres. This group had discussion meetings four days a week. Nearly half of the people audited, and the speakers, due to the lack of materials they mastered, some just parroted dogma, impractical; others relied on subjective judgments: "I think it is like this..." "I just think it is like this..." There was also little debate. Once, because they couldn't come up with any questions, they temporarily made up questions at the meeting. Thus, after the discussion meeting, the study was declared over. As a result, those with higher cultural and theoretical levels felt that the study was not in-depth and were not satisfied. Comrades with lower cultural and theoretical levels, because they spent most of their time carefully studying in discussion meetings, could not improve quickly.
    These are two relatively typical examples, and there are many similar situations. According to my understanding, the reason for these deviations is that some comrades simply understand collective learning as holding discussion meetings, or list "reading, informal talks, and discussions" as rigid formulas; others, in order to supervise group learning, regard collective discussion meetings as a means of forced learning, forgetting that learning should be based on conscious activity and must be understood ideologically to stimulate enthusiasm. This kind of mechanical approach sometimes encourages individual comrades not to work hard, waiting for the discussion meeting to "solve the problem." In addition, some people understand collective learning as "keeping pace" and "average development" in learning, so they vigorously "collectivize," such as collective reading, where one person reads and everyone listens, which is actually very ineffective because it is impossible to digest and impossible to think deeply. Some also stipulate that everyone must read the same amount of books within the same time, and those who read reference books are labeled as "aiming too high." These are all overly formal uses of collective learning, and the effect is not good. (Of course, when studying in institutions, in order to organize everyone to study and persist in studying, adopting this collective method at the beginning also has a certain role.)
    If these methods are not used properly, the actual results are often the opposite. Because the purpose of collective learning and collective discussion is to break the rigid learning methods of individualism, scholasticism, and injection, and replace them with cooperative, complementary, mass, and lively learning methods. The result of implementing this method is that individual learning is further improved through collective mutual assistance based on individual learning. If we do not advocate serious reading, in-depth study, linking with reality, and strengthening self-study in learning; but regard collective discussion as a framework for "average development" in learning, it is actually equivalent to canceling the role of drawing on strengths and collective mutual assistance. As a result, it is inevitable that "we can only restate what the teacher said, and there are no differences." "Group discussions often revolve around the experience level of a few people or even individuals, and cannot move forward, and cannot learn general theoretical knowledge." (Decision of the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the education of on-the-job cadres)
    Deviations like the above are currently widespread. In order to further improve the efficiency of collective learning, we should pay attention to this phenomenon and find ways to correct it. Therefore, I put forward my specific methods below:
    First, we must correctly practice the principle of "collective learning based on self-study." Whether leading learning or learning by oneself, we should put the cultivation of individual reading ability and research spirit, and the inspiration of conscious learning interest, in the main position. Collective discussion can only improve everyone's learning effect on this basis. Oppose formalism in collective discussion, discussion for the sake of discussion. Discussion meetings should be appropriately reduced, and the leadership should conduct them with preparation. Generally speaking, discussion meetings should only be held after studying a section (such as studying commodities in political economy), or in order to solve a certain problem (such as "What is heroic behavior?" ). The former is for the in-depth study of the issue, and the latter is to solve the problem.
    Second, reading and informal talks should be closely combined. Some groups often turn discussions into informal talks, and informal talks are like discussions; others mechanically define reading, informal talks, and discussions as three stages. These are all problematic. Informal talks mainly exchange experiences, discover problems, and exchange opinions widely. It is inseparable from reading. Informal talks are the most flexible and convenient form of collective mutual assistance. Helping comrades with lower cultural and theoretical levels is mainly done at this time (I have seen some group leaders always ask comrades with lower cultural and theoretical levels to speak first at discussion meetings, which makes them feel inferior). While reading carefully, exchange opinions anytime and anywhere in groups of three or five. It is not necessarily limited to this group, or mutual aid group. The scope may be wider. In this way, reading leads to informal talks, and informal talks lead to further reading, so that we can gradually go deeper, discover problems, and prepare for discussions.
    Third, discussion meetings should be well prepared. Many comrades think of preparation and think that writing a good outline is "all is well." At the meeting, they also "turn a deaf ear to others and only look at my outline." This is also one of the reasons why collective discussions are not lively and have no differences. Outlines can be used, but they should be "living outlines," opposing "dead outlines" and memorizing outlines. At the same time, preparation is not limited to outlines. More importantly, it is the foundation of self-study and determining the purpose of collective discussion before the meeting. The issues for discussion should be concentrated on one or two, and not disperse efforts, and we should look for common and widely existing problems. Experience has shown that the closer the issues at the discussion meeting are to reality, the more heated and in-depth the debate will be. One of the reasons for the success of the discussion meeting on "What is heroic action?" is that it is so inextricably linked to reality.

### 对集体学习的几点意见

　　对集体学习的几点意见
    苏星
    集体学习方法比单纯个人学习方法的效果好——这是经验证明了的。但近来了解到有些单位和小组，曾经在集体讨论中发生过一些偏差，在这里仅就所见提出几点意见。
    我曾经看过一个单位政治学习的日程表：白天讲课，晚上小组漫谈，第二天早晨准备提纲，上午小组讨论。过了两天又这样循环一次。当我去参加一个小组讨论会的时候，在会上看到了这样的情形：开始大家沉默，发言时意见重复，不深入，没有争论，呆板地轮流发言后，主席作一个结论就结束了。而这个结论，把工人和资产阶级的关系，说成和农民的关系相等，也没有异议。会后一个同学告诉我：“上课我们听到的相同，读参考书都很少，大家的发言主要的是重述教员讲的，因此没有分歧。遇见新问题，就弄不清楚了。”
    “你们不是可以多找一些材料来阐明这个问题吗？”我问。
    他说：“因为时间已经分配完了。”
    我还参加过一个干部小组的学习，这个小组一周内有四天是开讨论会。会上将近一半人旁听，而发言的人由于掌握的材料少，有的人只搬弄教条，不切实际；有的则凭主观论断：“我想是这样……。”“我就认为是这样……。”争论也很少。有一次由于提不出问题来，就到会上临时凑问题，这样，开过讨论会后，学习就宣告结束。结果文化理论水平较高的，觉得学习不深入，不满意。文化理论水平较低的同志，由于把精心研读的时间，大部让讨论会占去，也不能很快提高。
    这是两个比较典型的例子，类似这样的情形还不少。根据了解，产生这些偏差的原因，是由于有些同志把集体学习单纯的理解为开讨论会，或把“阅读、漫谈、讨论”列成刻板的公式；还有的人为了督促小组学习，而把集体讨论会当作一个强制学习的手段，忘记了学习应当是基于自觉的活动，必须搞通思想，才能启发其积极性。象这样机械的搞法，有时候倒助长了个别同志的不用功，专等讨论会“解决问题”；另外有的人则把集体学习理解为学习上的“齐头并进”与“平均发展”，因此就大力“集体化”，比如集体阅读，一个人读大家听，实际上效果是很小的，因为不可能消化，又不可能深刻的思索。也有的规定每个人在同一时间内必须读等量的书，有人看参考书籍就被指为“好高鹜远”。这些都是过于形式的运用集体学习，效果并不好的。（自然，在机关学习时，为了组织大家学习，坚持学习，开始采用这种集体的方法，也有它一定的作用。）
    如果这些方法运用不得当，所收实际效果常常相反。因为集体学习集体讨论的目的，乃在于打破个人主义、经院式、注入式的死板的学习方法，代之以互助的、采长补短的、群众性的、生动的学习方法。这种方法实行的结果，就是在个人学习的基础上通过集体互助，又进一步提高了个人学习的效果。如果在学习上不提倡认真读书，深入钻研，联系实际，加强自学；而把集体讨论看作学习上“平均发展”的框子，实际上就等于取消采长补短，集体互助的作用。结果就必然“只能重述教员讲的，没有分歧”。“小组讨论常常是在少数人的或甚至个人的经验水平上打圈子，而不能向前推进一步，不能学到一般的理论知识。”（中共中央华北局关于在职干部教育的决定）
    象上面这样的偏差，在目前是大量存在着的。为了进一步提高集体学习的效率，我们应该重视这个现象并想法加以纠正。因此，下面提出我的几点具体办法：
    第一、要正确实践“集体学习以自学为基础”的原则。无论领导学习或自己学习都应该把培养个人阅读能力与钻研精神，启发自觉的学习兴趣，放在主要位置。在这个基础上进行集体讨论，才能提高每个人的学习效果。反对集体讨论中的形式主义，为讨论而讨论。讨论会应适当的减少，而且领导上要有准备的进行。一般的说要在学完一个段落（如政治经济学学完商品）之后，或者为了解决一定的问题（比如“什么是英雄行为”？）才开讨论会。前者是为了问题的深入，后者则为了解决问题。
    第二、阅读和漫谈密切结合起来。有些小组，常把讨论搞成漫谈，漫谈又象讨论；还有人把阅读、漫谈、讨论，机械的定为三阶段，这都有毛病。漫谈，主要是交换心得，发现问题，广泛的交换意见，它和阅读是不可分的。漫谈是集体互助的最灵活最方便的形式，帮助文化理论水平较低的同学主要在这个时候（我曾看见有些小组长在讨论会上总先找文化理论水平较低的同志发言，这会使他们自卑），一面细心阅读，一面三五成群随时随地交换意见，它不一定限有本小组，或互助小组，范围不妨更广泛一些。这样阅读了漫谈，漫谈了再阅读，才能逐渐深入，发现问题，准备讨论。
    第三、讨论会要准备的好。好多同志提起准备，认为写好提纲就“天下太平”了，到会上也是“两耳不听别人话，一心只看我提纲”。这也是产生集体讨论不生动，没分歧的原因之一。提纲可以用，但要“活提纲”，反对“死提纲”，背诵提纲；同时准备也不限于提纲。更重要的是自学的基础和在开会之前，确定集体讨论的目的。讨论的问题要集中一两个，不要分散力量，并且要找寻普遍而大量存在着的问题，经验所得，在讨论会上的问题，愈和现实接近，争辩就愈热烈，愈深入。“什么是英雄行动？”这个讨论会成功的原因之一，就是因为它和现实是那样血肉不可分。
