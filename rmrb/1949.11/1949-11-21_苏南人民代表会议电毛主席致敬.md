Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 20th: The first plenary session of the Su Nan People's Representative Conference sent a telegram to Chairman Mao and others to express their respects. The telegram reads as follows:

To Chairman Mao, all Vice Chairmen, and all members of the Central People's Government Committee:

The people of all circles in Su Nan, in accordance with the spirit of the Common Program of the People's Political Consultative Conference, held the Su Nan People's Representative Conference starting on the 25th of this month, which has now successfully concluded. During the conference, we first earnestly studied the Common Program and unanimously agreed that the program's points of implementing a people's democratic dictatorship internally, opposing feudalism and bureaucratic capitalism, and externally standing on the side of the international peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, opposing imperialist aggression, and guaranteeing lasting world peace, fully meet the demands of the people. We firmly express our support and vow to strive for the thorough implementation of the program. The current work in Su Nan focuses on mobilizing and organizing farmers to implement rent reduction, implement reasonable burdens, complete the autumn tax collection, and ensure the supply for the revolutionary war and the needs of national construction. We believe that this is the specific implementation of the Common Program in Su Nan today. We believe that under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, we will surely victoriously complete the glorious task of building a new people's democratic Su Nan. We extend our highest revolutionary salute!
