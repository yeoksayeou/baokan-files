　　South Korean Puppet Navy
　　Three Hundred Plus Men Mutiny
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 31st] Over three hundred officers and soldiers of the South Korean Lee Seung-man puppet "National Defense Forces" Navy have mutinied. At 1:00 AM on October 27th, the main force of the People's Guerrilla Unit in the Jiri Mountain area of ​​Gyeongsangnam-do attacked Jinju City, southeast of Jiri Mountain, and surrounded the puppet police station and the puppet army headquarters. Just as the puppet soldiers and police fell into extreme chaos, over three hundred officers and soldiers of the puppet navy launched an armed uprising, attacking the puppet soldiers and police forces engaged in street fighting with the guerrillas from behind. After two hours of fierce fighting, the main force of the puppet soldiers and police was completely annihilated. As the street fighting raged, the citizens of Jinju raised the national flag of the People's Republic, responding to the guerrillas' offensive and the patriotic officers and soldiers' uprising in the puppet navy. More than five hundred citizens spontaneously formed teams to assist in capturing the remaining bandits, stormed into the puppet municipal government, court, and prison, purged reactionaries, and rescued imprisoned patriots. This joint force, composed of the People's Guerrilla Unit, the mutinied navy, the citizen volunteers, and the patriots rescued from prison, eliminated the puppet army reinforcements sent from Masan to the east of Jinju at around 7:00 AM on the same day, and then continued their offensive in the southeast direction.

　　南朝鲜伪海军
  　三百余人起义
    【新华社北京三十一日电】南朝鲜李承晚伪“国防军”海军官兵三百余人起义。十月二十七日上午一时，庆尚南道智异山方面的人民游击队主力部队，攻入智异山东南的晋州市，包围了伪警察署和伪军司令部。正当伪军警陷入极端混乱状态之际，伪海军官兵三百余名发起武装起义，从背后袭击了正和游击队展开巷战的伪军警部队，经二小时的激战，伪军警主力部队全部被歼。在巷战猛烈进行的时候，晋州市民纷纷悬起了人民共和国的国旗，响应游击队的进攻和伪海军爱国官兵的起义。五百余市民自动编成队伍，协助捕捉残匪，并冲入伪市政府、法院及监狱，肃清了反动分子，救出了被囚爱国人士。这支由人民游击队、起义海军、市民志愿军和狱中救出的爱国人士合组而成的联合部队，于当日上午七时许在晋州以东消灭了自马山派来的伪军增援部队后，即继续向东南方向展开攻势。
