Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 16th: TASS Moscow, 11th: Pravda's Paris correspondent Zhukov recently published a special article entitled "Nowhere to Turn," commenting on the results of the recent Paris meeting of the so-called "European Economic Cooperation Bureau."

Zhukov pointed out that the results of the "OEEC" Paris meeting were far less significant than the bourgeois newspapers had previously touted. Everyone knows that Marshall Plan countries are prohibited from restoring and developing their trade and economic relations with European countries east of the American-controlled zone, which has disjointed the entire trade system of the Marshall Plan countries and worsened their foreign exchange position. Some newspapers say that as long as tariff restrictions are removed, Marshall Plan countries can increase their exports to the United States. This argument is ridiculous. American monopoly capitalists are themselves looking for places to sell their inventories, and they will certainly not be interested in Britain or France becoming competitors in their domestic market. Last year, France purchased goods worth 108 billion francs from the dollar area, while the total value of France's exports to these areas only compensated for one-tenth of this amount. This is proof. On the other hand, capitalists in Marshall Plan countries must also deal with the increasing danger of West German dumping. Here, German and American concerns are rapidly developing industrial sectors that constitute the war economic potential of several "empires," as the French call them. By completing the division of Germany, the United States has increased the threat of competition in the market between the giants of the Ruhr and Western European countries. East Germany can maintain and develop trade relations with its Eastern countries, while the Ruhr industry, which is under American control, is deprived of this possibility. In an attempt to somehow compensate for this loss, the American masters want to facilitate the sale of German goods in Western Europe, where the United States itself is also seeking markets. Therefore, it is no accident that the Deputy Prime Minister of the Bonn puppet government, Blücher, made his first appearance at the so-called OEEC Council meeting as a representative of West Germany. Needless to say, the market that Hoffmann and Blücher dreamed of is indeed very large. Here, there is room for both West German and American exporters to operate at the same time. But the only condition is the complete suffocation of industry and agriculture in Marshall Plan countries. For the capitalists of Western Europe, agreeing to this is tantamount to signing their own death warrant.

Zhukov then discussed the increasingly sharp contradictions between the Marshall Plan countries themselves. There is a fierce struggle between French and British export manufacturers for colonial markets. Contradictions between France and Italy are increasing. For years, American businessmen and diplomats have been urging France and Italy to establish a customs union, but no matter how many prompts come from Rome and Washington, things remain at a standstill. The sharp contradictions within the incongruous "Benelux" hybrid (referring to the economic alliance of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg) have become a source of public ridicule. Under these circumstances, it is of course difficult to sincerely talk about some kind of economic unity within the Marshall Plan countries.

Zhukov finally pointed out that the agitators of Wall Street and the initiators of the Marshall Plan want to strengthen their control over the politics and economy of Western Europe in order to accelerate the militarization of Western Europe. The results of the Paris meeting clearly reveal the further deterioration of contradictions within the imperialist camp and the aggravation of the economic and political crisis in Western European countries under American control.

### “走头无路！”　真理报评“欧洲经合局”会议结果

　　“走头无路！”
  　真理报评“欧洲经合局”会议结果
    【新华社北京十六日电】塔斯社莫斯科十一日讯：真理报驻巴黎记者朱可夫顷以“走头无路”为题，发表专文，评论所谓“欧洲经济合作局”最近一次巴黎会议的结果。
    朱可夫指出：“经合局”巴黎会议的结果较之资产阶级报刊所预先吹嘘者远为微小。大家知道，马歇尔化国家被禁止恢复并发展它们与美国控制区以东各欧洲国家的贸易与经济关系，这就使得马歇尔化国家整个贸易体系脱节，并使它们的外汇地位恶化。若干报纸说：只要取消关税限制，马歇尔计划各国就能增加它们向美国的输出。这种论点是可笑的。美国垄断资本家自己正在寻找推销他们的存货的地方，他们对于英国或法国成为其国内市场的竞争者，当然绝不会感到兴趣。在去年，法国自美元区购进的货物价值达一千零八十亿法郎，而法国向这些区域的输出总值，仅抵补了这个数额的十分之一。这就是一个证明。在另一方面，马歇尔化国家的资本家还必须对付西德向外倾销的日益增加的危险。在这里，德、美康采恩正在迅速地发展购成如法国人所称的几个“帝国”的战争经济潜力的工业部门。由于完成德国的分裂，美国增强了鲁尔的巨头与西欧国家间竞争市场的威胁。东部德国可以维持并发展与其东方的国家的贸易关系，而被置于美国支配之下的鲁尔工业，则被剥夺了这种可能。为了试图以某种办法补偿这种损失，美国主子要便利德国货物销行于美国自己也在那里寻求市场的西欧。因此，波恩傀儡政府的副总理布吕契，以西德代表的资格在所谓经合局理事会议上初次登台，并不是偶然的。不用说，霍夫曼和布吕契所梦想的市场，确是非常广大的。在这里，有西德及美国出口商同时活动的余地。但唯一的条件则为马歇尔化国家的工农业的完全被窒息。对西欧的资本家来说，同意这个，就无异在他们自己的催命书上鉴字。
    朱可夫接着论及马歇尔化国家本身之间的日益尖锐的矛盾。法国及英国的出口制造商之间，正在进行争夺殖民地市场的剧烈斗争。法意间的矛盾正在日益增加。数年以来，美国的商人和外交人员一直在驱使法国与意大利建立关税同盟，但不管自罗马及华盛顿来了多少提示，事情仍然毫无进展。不伦不类的“荷比卢”混血儿（指荷兰、比利时、卢森堡三国经济同盟）内部的尖锐矛盾，已成为大家笑谈的资料。在这种情况之下，当然很难诚恳地谈马歇尔化国家内部的某种经济统一了。
    朱可夫最后指出，华尔街的煽动者和马歇尔计划的创导人，想加强他们对西欧政治及经济的控制，以加速西欧的军事化。巴黎会议的结果，清楚地透露了帝国主义阵营内部矛盾的进一步恶化及美国控制之下西欧各国经济政治危机的加剧。
