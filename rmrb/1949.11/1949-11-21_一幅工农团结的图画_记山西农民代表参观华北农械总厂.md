　　A Picture of Worker-Peasant Unity
　　A Record of Shanxi Peasant Representatives Visiting the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory

    On the morning of the 18th, over a hundred peasants in various attires appeared in the Jiulongshan industrial area in the eastern suburbs of Beijing. This was the Shanxi Peasant Representative Delegation, which had come to visit the Tianjin Industrial Exhibition and was making a special trip to visit the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory, planning to order a batch of new agricultural tools by the way. Among them were peasants in their sixties and seventies, labor heroes who had become prosperous through production, as well as male and female peasant representatives elected by the local peasants.
    At eight o'clock, when the peasant representatives happily entered the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory, a scene of great worker-peasant unity immediately unfolded. All the staff and workers of the Agricultural Machinery General Factory warmly welcomed these distinguished guests from the countryside. Everyone shook hands and exchanged greetings, appearing so cordial. Even the workers who were busy with production smiled and poked their heads out of the workshops, expressing their heartfelt welcome to the peasant representatives. The representatives also nodded and smiled at the welcomers, expressing their gratitude.
    The peasant representatives followed the staff and workers to visit various machines. They listened to the staff explain the effectiveness of various new agricultural tools and smiled with satisfaction. The peasants said, "This is great. In the past, during the busy farming season, the whole family, men, women, and children, had to work in the fields together, and we could only cultivate a few mu a day. Now with these new tools, we can plant dozens of mu a day. We will have a way out." Liu Jubao, an old hero from Lucheng County, said, "In the past, intensive cultivation took so much effort, and we still couldn't grow good crops. With these new machines, are we still afraid of not growing good crops?" He pointed to the weeder and said, "In the past, weeding the seedlings four or five times was difficult. With this kind of weeder, weeding ten times wouldn't be difficult."
    Among the thousands of Liberation-style weeders, Li Shunda, a labor hero from Pingshun, began to calculate. He said, "Our village needs to find a way to buy a set of new tools. One seed selector is enough for the whole village. If one family can't afford it, the mutual aid team and cooperative can buy it together. With several hundred mu of land, buying a set of agricultural tools is enough. At that time, we can save more labor to do other production..." Other representatives were also calculating what agricultural tools they needed. They asked about the prices of these tools and inquired in detail about how to use these new types of tools.
    The fifteen-horsepower water pump was turned on, and water flowed out like a spring. This kind of water pump can irrigate 700 mu of paddy fields or 1,000 mu of dry land in one day. Meng Fangzhuo, a labor hero from Qingyuan County, said, "Our area is drought-stricken nine years out of ten. During droughts, everyone goes to carry water to irrigate the fields, and we can only irrigate a few fen of land a day. As soon as we irrigate, it dries up again. People suffer so much. With this, we don't have to be afraid of drought." People thought of the scenes of past droughts and imagined the picture of using this kind of water pump to overcome droughts. Xiang Tishui, a labor hero from Huguan County, said, "With this thing, we don't have to worry about drought anymore." Those peasant representatives living along the Zhang River were planning to buy water pumps together.
    In the riveting workshop, the workers and peasant representatives appeared so close. The workers patiently explained the functions of the tools to the representatives, and the peasant representatives listened quietly. They said, "You work so hard, completely producing machines for us. We will definitely use them well and grow more grain for you to eat." The workers said, "You also work hard all year round farming the land!" Jin Kaiyi, a labor hero from Pingyao County, said, "We can have a good life if we help each other."
    The visiting time passed, the workers felt the representatives' visit was too short, and the representatives were also reluctant to leave. When the car engine started, the representatives were about to leave, and the workers surrounded the car to bid farewell to these distinguished guests. They shouted, "Long live the great worker-peasant unity!" "Farewell to all labor heroes!" "Learn from the heroes!" The peasant representatives also shouted, "Learn from the worker elder brothers!" "Welcome workers to make more machines for us!" After a burst of enthusiastic applause, the workers sang the song "Unity is Strength." The car drove a long way, and the peasant representatives kept waving to the workers who were saying goodbye. (Attached picture)

　　一幅工农团结的图画
　　记山西农民代表参观华北农械总厂
　　朱波
    十八日的早晨，在北京东郊九龙山工业区，出现了一百多身着各种服装的农民，这就是参观天津工展的山西农民代表团，今天特赶来参观华北农业机械总厂，并打算顺便订购一批新型的农业工具。这里面有六、七十岁的农民，有生产发家致富的劳动英雄，也有为当地农民推选出来的男女农民代表们。
    八点钟，当农民代表们愉快的走进了华北农械总厂的时候，立即出现了一幅工农大团结的图景。农械总厂的全体职工们热烈欢迎这些来自农村的贵宾，大家互相握手、问候，显得那么亲热，连那些正忙于生产的工人们，也都从工房里微笑着伸出头来，表示他们内心里对农民代表们的欢迎。代表们也向欢迎者含笑点头，表示谢意。
    农民代表随着职工们参观各种机器，他们听到职工们解释各种新式农具的效能，都满意的笑了。农民们说：“这一下可好了，过去农忙季节，全家男女老少一齐下地，一天才能耕种几亩，现在有了这些新家具，一天就能种几十亩，以后可有办法了。”潞城县老英雄刘聚宝说：“过去深耕细作费多少工，老种不好，有了这些新机器，还怕养种不好吗？”他指着耘锄说：“过去锄四、五遍苗，人们都觉着困难，有了这种锄，锄十遍也不困难。”
    在千百架解放式耘锄中，平顺劳动英雄李顺达盘算起来了，他说：“俺村要想法买一套新工具。全村里有一架选种机就行了。一家买不起，互助组、合作社合起来就买起了。有几百亩地，买上一套农具就行了，那时候可剩出更多的劳动力来，做别的生产……”。其他代表们也在计算着要什么农业工具，他们问明白了这些工具的价格，并详细问明白了这些新型工具的使用方法。
    十五匹马力的抽水机开动了，水象泉涌一样的流出来。这种抽水机一天能浇水地七百亩，浇旱地一千亩。清源县劳动英雄孟方琢说：“我们那地方十年九旱，天旱时所有的人都去抬水担水浇地，一天只能浇几分地，浇过去随着就又晒干了，人们多艰难，有了这可不怕天旱了。人们想到过去旱灾的景象，想到应用这种抽水机战胜旱灾的图景。壶关县劳动英雄向提水说：“有了这种东西，就不要再发愁天旱了。”那些居住在漳河两岸的农民代表们，都计划着合伙买抽水机。
    在铆工房里，工人和农民代表们显得那么亲近，工人向代表们耐心的讲解工具的功能，农民代表都静静地听。他们说：“你们这么辛苦，完全为我们生产机器，我们一定好好使用它，多收粮食供你们吃”。工人们说：“你们一年四季种地也不容易呀！”平遥县劳动英雄靳开义说：“咱们是互相帮助光景就能过好。”
    参观的时间过去了，工人们嫌代表参观的时间太短，代表们也恋恋不舍。当汽车发动机响起来的时候，代表们就要走了，工人都围到汽车周围欢送这些贵宾，他们高呼着“工农大团结万岁！”“欢送各位劳动英雄！”“向英雄们学习！”农民代表也高呼：“向工人老大哥学习！”“欢迎工人为我们多造机器！”在一阵狂烈的鼓掌后，工人们唱起“团结就是力量”的歌曲。汽车走了好远，农民代表们还不断向着欢送的工人挥动着手。（附图片）
