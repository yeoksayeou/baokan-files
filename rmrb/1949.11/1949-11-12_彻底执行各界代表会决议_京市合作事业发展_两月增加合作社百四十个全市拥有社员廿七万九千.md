    [Beijing News] Beijing's cooperative business is rapidly developing. In the past two months, over 140 new cooperatives of various types have been established. The Beijing Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative Headquarters thoroughly implemented the resolutions of the People's Representatives Conference regarding the development of cooperative enterprises. In the past two months, a significant amount of work has been carried out to establish cooperatives. From August to the end of October, seven production cooperatives, ninety consumer cooperatives, forty-seven suburban village cooperatives and medical cooperatives were added; in addition, there were ten handicraft production groups. The number of cooperatives has increased by 64.6 percent compared to before the People's Representatives Conference. Currently, there are a total of 223 cooperatives in the city (including production cooperatives, consumer cooperatives, village cooperatives, and suburban medical cooperatives), fourteen production groups, with a total of 279,197 members, accounting for 14.26 percent of the city's population. In terms of business, the Supply and Marketing Cooperative Headquarters opened non-member transactions on September 24 to supply citizens with various daily necessities. At the same time, it mobilized and helped various cooperatives establish forty-three coal briquette processing plants to supply members with coal for the winter. Currently, each factory produces an average of 155 tons of coal briquettes per day. In addition to carrying out work such as lending wheat seeds and pre-purchasing farmers' rice and miscellaneous grains, suburban cooperative work also cooperated with the Municipal Government Health Bureau to establish four medical cooperatives in the suburbs. At the same time, the Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative Headquarters also sent eighteen livestock epidemic prevention technicians to the suburbs to carry out preventive injections for poultry and livestock to prevent chicken plague that has occurred in the suburbs over the years. In September and October, a total of 15,890 chickens and 62 pigs were injected, and 67 livestock health committees were mobilized among farmers to reflect the health status of livestock at any time.
