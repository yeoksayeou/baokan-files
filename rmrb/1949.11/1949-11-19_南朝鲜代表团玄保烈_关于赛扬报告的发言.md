Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 18th. The full text of South Korean delegate Hyun Bo-ryeol's speech on the Saillant Report is as follows:

Dear fellow delegates!

　　I, on behalf of the National Council of Korean Labor Unions (South Korean All-Council), enthusiastically support Comrade Louis Saillant, Secretary-General of the World Federation of Trade Unions’ report.

　　As everyone knows, the World Federation of Trade Unions Executive Bureau meeting held in Moscow in June 1946 decided to send a World Federation of Trade Unions delegation to Japan and Korea for investigation. The World Federation of Trade Unions delegation, headed by Comrade Louis Saillant, arrived in Seoul, South Korea, on March 30, 1947.

　　Since the US invading army stationed in South Korea, South Korea’s political, economic, and cultural conditions have suffered great destruction due to the tyranny of the US military in less than a year and a half. The living conditions of the workers deteriorated sharply, and unemployment increased day by day. The reign of terror and brutality not only completely deprived the labor movement of its freedom and the people of their basic rights, but even the workers' demands for improved working conditions were brutally suppressed. Under these conditions, all activities of the National Council had to be turned into underground activities.

　　The US imperialist military government instigated several pro-Japanese elements to organize the so-called "Great Korean Labor Association," attempting to split the working class united under the banner of the National Council. On the one hand, they dressed up this organization as representing the South Korean trade union. On the other hand, they used it to hinder the National Council's connection with the World Federation of Trade Unions delegation. However, our council still managed to have some members meet with the delegation and make contact. On the second day of the delegation's arrival, which was March 31, 1947, it was scheduled to inspect the textile factory in Yongdungpo, Gyeongseong, but it was obstructed by the reactionary factory manager and could not inspect it. The delegation witnessed two members of the National Council being beaten for going to welcome the delegation. Regarding this matter, the delegation submitted a letter of protest to the US military government chief. In this protest letter, the delegation firmly demanded: "Guarantee the safety of the lives of these two and the Koreans accompanying us" and "Guarantee and stipulate in writing that people have the freedom to choose and join trade unions on a completely democratic basis," and so on. This visit by the World Federation of Trade Unions delegation had a great impact on the South Korean labor movement.

　　First, it enhanced the prestige of the National Council among the working class and all the people. It clearly proved to the working class and all the people of South Korea that the National Council, which unites the South Korean working class, is still a genuine, internationally connected, and prestigious labor organization despite being in the midst of the US imperialist's malicious propaganda and various divisive and sabotage schemes.

　　Second, it also made a great contribution to strengthening the unity of the South Korean working class. As is well known, the US imperialists and their lackeys have spared no despicable and shameless conspiracies to undermine the unity of the working class. They had instigated assassination gang leaders and organized reactionary trade unions in South Korea, but the visit of the World Federation of Trade Unions delegation shattered them in a timely manner.

　　Third, the South Korean working class, thanks to the delegation's visit, more clearly recognized their solid unity with the international working class, and received great encouragement and strengthened their own strength for struggle.

　　The delegation's letter of protest to the Korean US military government, after being published in many newspapers and periodicals in South Korea, has left a deep impression among the broad masses of people.

　　After this report was published at the Prague Council in 1947, the atrocities of US imperialism and its lackeys in South Korea were also completely exposed to the working class and working people of the world, and were thus subjected to the world's just public opinion and condemnation.

　　The South Korean working class always remembers the visit of the World Federation of Trade Unions delegation, and at the same time is filled with feelings of pride and self-respect, because their own struggle is united with the struggle of the working class all over the world through the World Federation of Trade Unions. From that day on, our National Council, under the trust of all workers and working people, resolutely struggled to realize all the decisions and instructions of the World Federation of Trade Unions. This valuable international connection has strengthened the South Korean working class's confidence in victory.

　　Dear delegates, the World Federation of Trade Unions’ contribution and prestige in Asia are not limited to South Korea, but extend throughout a vast region. It has played a huge role in the growth and development of the anti-imperialist and democratic forces of the Asian people. Now, the democratic forces in Asia have developed and consolidated as never before, and are already able to drive out the US imperialist-led invading forces. The reactionary group headed by US imperialism is desperately searching for its own way out in the face of the world's, including Asia's, democratic forces, and the resolute struggle of the working class of all countries for peace and freedom.

　　Imperialists all over the world are conducting vicious instigation and conspiracies in order to launch a new war. At the same time, they are also using various methods to suppress and slaughter Asian nations who are fighting for the liberation and independence of their countries, and are desperately trying to find a base in Asia to provoke war. Therefore, the oppressed nations of Asia, and their vanguards, the working class of various countries, must assume a major task, which is to heighten vigilance, strengthen unity, and actively struggle to smash the conspiracy of war provocateurs.

　　At this moment, the World Federation of Trade Unions is holding the World Federation of Trade Unions Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference in Beijing—a city of historical significance to the Chinese people that was won through a long period of struggle by the Chinese people—and its political significance is very significant. It has further encouraged the working class of the entire Asia to carry out the struggle to defend peace, and encouraged them to carry out their own liberation struggle.

　　I must emphasize again and again that this conference has great significance for the South Korean labor movement. Because the Chinese revolution has been successful, and the honorable Chinese people have established the People's Republic of China, US imperialism has lost a vast base for invading the mainland; because of the epoch-making democratic construction in the northern half of Korea, the US imperialist's conspiracy to invade the mainland has been greatly hit. Therefore, US imperialism attaches special importance to South Korea in order to oppose the Soviet Union and invade these two young democratic countries; desperately trying to seize South Korea with its bloody claws, and attempting to use South Korea as the most important base for US imperialism's invasion of the East.

　　US imperialism has established a "murderous system" in South Korea, which has plunged the children of the South Korean people into a sea of blood, and instigated its lackey, Syngman Rhee, to carry out various inhuman murderous policies. The human rights and political rights of the South Korean working class and all the people have been completely deprived. Now, as soon as they discover a cadre of the National Council or someone who participates in the trade union led by it, they immediately shoot him. The South Korean working class is groaning under unprecedented tyrannical rule. However, the workers of South Korea are closely united around the Democratic People's Republic of Korea led by Chairman Kim Il-sung, holding high the flag of the Republic, and bravely struggling forward to drive out the US imperialists' occupation of South Korea, overthrow the US lackey UN Korean Commission, and the Syngman Rhee puppet traitorous regime, and strive for the unification and complete independent autonomy of the motherland.

　　Of course, this struggle has indescribable difficulties, but the South Korean people, especially its vanguard, the working class, have strengthened their strength due to unity under these difficult conditions, giving them even more solid confidence in victory. At the same time, we firmly believe that the tens of millions of brothers all over the world who have close interests with us are supporting our struggle and are looking forward to the success of this conference. On behalf of the South Korean working class, I actively support this conference, and at the same time, for the success of this conference, I am willing to make every effort and take it as a great honor.

　　On behalf of the South Korean delegation, I propose the following suggestion: In the name of this conference, issue an appeal to the working people of the Netherlands, France, the United Kingdom, and the United States, calling on them to demand that their governments promptly stop the armed intervention in Indonesia, Vietnam, Burma, Malaya, and South Korea and withdraw their troops.

### 南朝鲜代表团玄保烈　关于赛扬报告的发言

　　南朝鲜代表团玄保烈
  　关于赛扬报告的发言
    【新华社北京十八日电】南朝鲜代表团玄保烈关于赛扬报告的发言全文如下：亲爱的诸位代表同志们！
    我代表朝鲜劳动组合全国评议会（南朝鲜全评）热烈地支持世界工联总书记路易·赛扬同志的报告。
    大家都知道，一九四六年六月在莫斯科召开的世界工联执行局会议曾经决定派世界工联代表团到日本和朝鲜去进行调查。以路易·赛扬同志为团长的世界工联代表团，在一九四七年三月三十日到达南朝鲜汉城。
    自从美国侵略军队进驻南朝鲜以后，不到一年半的光景，南朝鲜的政治经济文化由于美军的暴政，受了很大的摧残。工人们的生活状态急转直下地恶化，失业者日益增加。恐怖和残暴的统治，不但完全剥夺了工人运动的自由和人民的基本权利，甚至就是工人们关于改善劳动条件的要求也受到残酷的镇压。在这种条件下，全国评议会所有的活动，不得不转为地下活动了。
    美帝国主义者的军政当局，唆使几个亲日分子组织所谓“大韩劳总”，企图分裂在全国评议会旗帜下团结起来的工人阶级。他们一方面把这个组织装扮成代表南朝鲜的工会，另一方面，又利用它来阻碍我全国评议会与世界工联代表团的连络。但是我们的评议会仍然设法使一部分委员和代表团会见，取得了联系。代表团到达的第二天，就是一九四七年三月三十一日，预定在永登浦视察京城的纺织工场，但是竟遭到了反动工厂经理的阻碍，而不能视察。代表团在那里目睹了二位全国评议会会员为着去欢迎代表团而挨打。为了这件事，代表团曾向美军政长官提出抗议书。代表团在这个抗议书里面坚决要求：“向代表团保证这二位以及陪伴我们的朝鲜人的生命的安全”，和“要保证并成文规定，在完全民主的基础上，人民有自由选择和加入工会的自由”等等。世界工联代表团这一次的访问，实在给南朝鲜工人运动以很大的影响。
    第一、它在工人阶级与全体人民当中，提高了全国评议会的威信。在南朝鲜工人阶级与全体人民眼前，明明白白地证明了，团结南朝鲜工人阶级的全国评议会，虽然处在美帝的恶劣宣传以及种种分裂破坏阴谋当中，它依然是真正的、有国际联系的，和有威信的工人组织。
    第二、在加强南朝鲜工人阶级的团结方面，它也有莫大的贡献。如所周知，美帝及其走狗们，为了破坏工人阶级的统一与团结，不惜采取一切卑鄙无耻的阴谋诡计。他们曾经在南朝鲜，嗾使暗杀团的头目，组织反动工会，但是世界工联代表团的访问，恰恰及时地粉碎了他们。
    第三、南朝鲜工人阶级由于代表团的访问，更明确地认识了他们和国际工人阶级的巩固的团结，而且获得了很大的鼓励，加强了本身的斗争力量。
    代表团对朝鲜美军政当局所提出的抗议书，在南朝鲜的许多报纸和刊物上发表出来以后，已在广大人民中间留下深刻的印象。
    这个报告在一九四七年布拉格的理事会上发表之后，美帝国主义及其走狗在南朝鲜的暴行，在全世界工人阶级和劳动人民面前，也完全暴露出来，因而受到全世界正义的舆论和谴责。
    南朝鲜工人阶级，无论在什么时候都记着世界工联代表团的访问，同时充满着自傲与自尊的感情，因为他们自己的斗争，通过了世界工联，和全世界的工人阶级的斗争联合团结在一起。从那天起，我全国评议会，在全体工人与劳动人民的信赖之下，坚决为实现世界工联的一切决定与指示而斗争。这种宝贵的国际联系，更加强了南朝鲜工人阶级对胜利的信心。
    敬爱的诸位代表们，世界工联在亚洲的贡献与威信，不仅限于南朝鲜，而是遍于广大的地域。它对亚洲人民的反帝的民主力量的生长与发展，起了巨大的作用。现在，亚洲的民主力量，已经空前发展巩固，已经能够赶出美帝国主义为首的侵略势力。以美帝国主义为首的反动集团，在全世界的，包括亚洲的民主力量，以及各国工人阶级争取和平自由的坚决斗争面前，正在拼命地找寻自己的出路。
    全世界的帝国主义者，为了发动新战争，正在进行恶毒的煽动与阴谋。同时，还用各种方法去镇压和杀戮为祖国的解放与独立而奋斗的亚洲诸民族，并且拼命想在亚洲找到一个挑拨战争的基地。因此，亚洲各被压迫的民族，及其先锋、各国工人阶级，必须担负起一个重大的任务，就是提高警惕，加紧团结，积极斗争，以粉碎战争挑拨者的阴谋。
    正在这个时候，世界工联在北京——中国人民经过长期的斗争争取过来的对中国人民有历史意义的都市——召开世界工联亚澳工会会议，其政治意义非常重大。它更加鼓舞了全亚洲工人阶级去进行保卫和平的斗争，和鼓励他们去进行自己的解放斗争。
    我再三要强调，这个大会对南朝鲜工人运动有着巨大的意义。由于中国革命已经成功，荣誉的中国人民建立了人民共和国，美帝国主义丧失了侵略大陆的广大基地；由于北半部朝鲜的划时代的民主建设，使美帝侵略大陆的阴谋受到大的打击。因此，美帝国主义为了反苏和侵略这两个年青的民主国家，就特别重视南朝鲜；拼命地企图用它的血爪攫住南朝鲜，企图把南朝鲜作为美帝国主义侵略东方的一个最重要的基地。
    美帝在南朝鲜树立了“虐杀制度”，它使得南朝鲜人民的子女们陷于血海中，嗾使他们的走狗李承晚，进行各种惨无人道的虐杀政策。南朝鲜工人阶级和全体人民的人权以及政治权利，已经完全被剥夺了。现在，他们一发现全国评议会的干部或是参加它所领导的工会的人，就立即把他枪毙。南朝鲜工人阶级正在空前的暴虐统治下呻吟着。但是南朝鲜的工人，正紧紧团结在领袖金日成主席所领导的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的周围，高举共和国的旗帜，为着驱逐美帝在南朝鲜的占领，打倒美国走狗联大朝鲜委员团，以及李承晚的傀儡卖国政权，为争取祖国的统一与完全自主独立而英勇斗争，向前迈进。
    当然，这个斗争有不可形容的困难，但是，南朝鲜人民，尤其是他的先锋队工人阶级，在这种困难条件下因团结而加强的力量，使他们对胜利抱着更坚固的信心。同时，我们坚信，与我们有密切利害关系的全世界的千万弟兄们，都在支援我们的斗争，都在期望着本大会的成功。我代表南朝鲜工人阶级，积极支持这个大会，同时为了本大会的成功，我愿意尽一切的努力，并引为莫大的光荣。
    我代表南朝鲜代表团提出如下的建议，就是：以本大会的名义，向荷兰、法国、英国以及美国的劳动人民发出号召，号召他们要求其本国政府迅速地停止在印度尼西亚、越南、缅甸、马来以及南朝鲜进行的武装干涉并撤退他们的军队。
