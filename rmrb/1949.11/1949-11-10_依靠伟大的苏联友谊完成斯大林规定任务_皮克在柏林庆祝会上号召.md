　　Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 9th: The German Democratic Republic is universally celebrating the 32nd anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution. Most factories in Berlin held commemorative meetings on the 6th. On the 7th, a celebration hosted by the Provisional Government of the German Democratic Republic was held at the Berlin State Opera. Attendees included President Pieck of the German Democratic Republic, government officials, the head of the Soviet diplomatic mission, Pushkin, representatives of German political parties and mass organizations, and advanced workers in industry. Prime Minister Grotewohl of the Provisional Government of the German Democratic Republic delivered a lengthy report on the significance of the Great October Socialist Revolution. His speech was frequently interrupted by applause. Grotewohl emphasized that the German people must use their own strength, relying on the friendship with the great Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, to build a new peace-loving and democratic Germany, so as to complete the enormous tasks stipulated in the historically significant telegram of Marshal Stalin. Grotewohl also pointed out that in East Germany, tractors are plowing land confiscated from Junker aristocrats, while in West Germany, tanks are rumbling. Grotewohl said: However, the imperialists cannot turn back the tide of history. We are not fighting alone, we will build a new democratic Germany. We thank the many countries for the trust they have shown in us, and we thank first of all the Soviet Union and its leader Marshal Stalin. (Prolonged enthusiastic cheers for Stalin.) The establishment of the German Democratic Republic is not only an action aimed at strengthening the camp of peace and democracy, but also a major blow to the instigators of a new war. With the establishment of the Republic, the struggle for the reunification of Germany has entered a new stage. Grotewohl particularly emphasized the extensive assistance given to Germany by the Soviet government and the Soviet people. Grotewohl concluded his speech amidst thunderous applause, extending special congratulations to the Soviet people, the Soviet government, and Marshal Stalin on the 32nd anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, a festival for the whole world. Deputy Prime Ministers Kasner (Liberal Democratic Party) and Nuschke (Christian Democratic Union) then delivered brief speeches. They urged the German people to consolidate the friendship with the great Soviet Union, which is the main prerequisite for the peaceful and democratic development of Germany and the main prerequisite for creating a better future. After the government officials' speeches, the choir sang the Soviet national anthem and for the first time sang the national anthem of the German Democratic Republic (lyrics by the poet Becher, music by Eisler).

    【新华社北京九日电】塔斯社柏林讯：德意志民主共和国普遍地庆祝伟大十月社会主义革命三十二周年纪念日。柏林多数工厂均于六日举行纪念会。七日，德意志民主共和国临时政府所主持的庆祝会，在柏林国家歌剧院举行。出席者有德意志民主共和国总统皮克、政府人员，苏联外交使团团长普式金，德国政党与群众团体的代表以及工业中的先进工人。德意志民主共和国临时政府总理格罗提渥发表关于伟大十月社会主义革命意义的长篇报告。他的演说时常被掌声打断。格罗提渥强调说：德国人民必须用自己的力量，依靠与伟大的苏联及各人民民主国家间的友谊，建立新的爱好和平的民主德国，俾完成斯大林大元帅的具有历史意义的电文中所规定的巨大任务。格罗提渥并指出：在东德，拖拉机正在耕种着从容克贵族手中没收的土地，而在西德，坦克却在辚辚地吼着。格罗提渥说：但是，帝国主义者们是不能使历史倒退的。我们不是孤军作战的，我们将建立起新的民主德国。我们感谢许多国家对我们所表示的信任，我们首先感谢苏联及其领袖斯大林大元帅。（长时间为斯大林热烈欢呼。）德意志民主共和国的成立，不仅是旨在加强和平与民主阵营的行动，它还是对于新战争挑拨者的重大打击。随着共和国的成立，争取德国重新统一的斗争进入了新的阶段。格罗提渥特别强调苏联政府与苏联人民给予德国的广泛援助。格罗提渥在群众雷动的掌声中作结语时，特别为伟大的十月社会主义革命三十二周年纪念日这个全世界的节日向苏联人民、苏联政府及斯大林大元帅致贺。副总理卡斯纳（自由民主党）与努舍克（基督教民主联盟）继而发表简短演说。他们敦促德国人民巩固与伟大苏联的友谊，这一友谊乃是德国的和平民主发展的主要前提，乃是缔造更好的未来的主要前提。政府人员演说以后，合唱团唱苏联国歌，并第一次唱德意志民主共和国国歌（诗人拜契尔作词，尤斯勒制谱）。
