    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 13th—Telepress, Sofia: Bulgarian newspapers published on the 11th a speech by Chervenkov, Secretary of the Bulgarian Communist Party, stating: The main tasks of the Bulgarian people at present are: to increase production, ensure supplies to the people, conquer drought, improve livestock breeding, increase land yields, improve cultivation, solve electrification and fuel problems, and establish regular commodity exchange between the national industry and the rural economy. Chervenkov called on the people to fight against Kostovism—Bulgaria's Titoism. He said: Kostov and his gang, following the orders and guidance of the enemy, conspired to separate Bulgaria from the Soviet Union and make Bulgaria dependent on Tito's Yugoslavia and imperialism. Kostovism is the mortal enemy of Bulgaria's national independence, and fighting against Kostovism is fighting against our class enemies.
