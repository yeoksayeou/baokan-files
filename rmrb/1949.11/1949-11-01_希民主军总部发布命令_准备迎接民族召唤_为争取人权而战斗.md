　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 30th -- Electroneews Agency, Prague: The General Headquarters of the Greek Democratic Army issued a special order on the 28th, commemorating two historically significant events for the Greek people: the great uprising of the Greek people on October 28, 1940, against the invasion of Mussolini's fascist army, and the establishment of the General Headquarters of the Greek Democratic Army on October 28, 1946. The order stated: After three years of fighting for the freedom and independence of Greece, the Greek Democratic Army continues to represent the heroic traditions in Greek history, from the national revolution of 1812 to the victory over the Italian fascist invasion and the resistance movement against the Nazi occupation in 1940-1941. The Greek Democratic Army has won the love and support of the Greek people. Grammos, Vitsi, Karditsa, Naoussa, Karpenisi, and thousands of other battles have proven the strength of the Democratic Army, the correctness and superiority of its political leadership, and its discipline and determination to fight to save the Greek people. The Greek Democratic Army is a regular revolutionary force and is proud to fight for the rights of the people.
    After the Greek Provisional Democratic Government announced its decision to the Greek people on October 15, the main force of the Democratic Army has ceased fighting in order to save Greece from complete destruction. However, the Democratic Army has not laid down its arms; fighters, commanders, and political commissars are preparing to answer the nation's call.

　　希民主军总部发布命令
  　准备迎接民族召唤  为争取人权而战斗
    【新华社北京三十日电】电通社布拉格讯：希腊民主军总司令部二十八日发布特别命令，纪念希腊人民的两个具有历史意义的事件，即：一九四○年十月二十八日希腊人民抵抗墨索里尼的法西斯军队侵略的伟大起义，和一九四六年十月二十八日希腊民主军总司令部成立。命令称：在为争取希腊的自由和独立的三年战斗之后，希腊民主军继续代表着从一八一二年民族革命到一九四○——一九四一年战胜意大利法西斯侵略和反抗纳粹占领运动的希腊历史上的英勇传统。希腊民主军已赢得了希腊人民的爱戴和拥护。格拉姆斯、维齐、卡迪柴、脑萨、卡彭尼西和其他成千的战役，已证明了民主军的实力，政治领导的正确性和优越性，证明了它的纪律和为拯救希腊人民而战斗的决心。希腊民主军是一支正规的革命队伍，并以进行争取人民权利的战斗而自豪。
    在希腊临时民主政府于十月十五日向希腊人民宣布其决定后，民主军主力已停止战斗，以便拯救希腊免于全部毁灭。但民主军并未放下武器，战斗员、司令员和政治委员正准备着迎接民族的召唤。
