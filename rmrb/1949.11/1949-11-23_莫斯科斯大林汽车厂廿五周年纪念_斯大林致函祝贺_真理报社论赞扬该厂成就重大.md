Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 22nd: TASS, Moscow, November 19th: On the 25th anniversary of the Moscow Stalin Automobile Plant, Stalin sent a special letter of congratulations to Comrade Likhachev, Director of the plant, Comrade Krylov, Chief Engineer, and Comrade Kovalev, the Soviet Communist Party Central Committee Organizer, and others. The congratulatory letter stated: I congratulate the men and women workers, engineers, technicians, and other employees of the Moscow Automobile Plant on the 25th anniversary of the plant and the honor of receiving the Order of Lenin.

　　The Moscow Automobile Plant, the first automobile manufacturing enterprise in the Soviet Union, plays a leading role in the development of our country's automobile industry and the training of Bolshevik automobile manufacturing personnel.

　　After the war, the plant personnel have achieved significant accomplishments and have completely mastered the mass production of new types of automobiles stipulated in the 1950 plan based on the adoption of advanced technology.

　　Comrades, I hope and wish you new achievements in technology and further development in our country's automobile production.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 22nd: TASS, Moscow: November 19th is the 25th anniversary of the Moscow Stalin Automobile Plant. Twenty-five years ago, this first automobile factory in the Soviet Union was called the "AMO" Automobile Factory, and it produced the first ten Soviet-made large trucks for the Soviet state. Over the past 25 years, the factory has undergone tremendous changes, developing into a first-class large factory that plays the most important role in the development of the Soviet automobile manufacturing industry. The Stalin Automobile Plant is now producing thousands upon thousands of high-quality large trucks, passenger cars, and comfortable buses.

　　Soviet newspapers widely commemorate the glorious 25th anniversary of the factory. The People's Daily editorial pointed out: The history of the growth of the Stalin Automobile Plant clearly reflects the tremendous changes created by our people under the wise leadership of the Party of Lenin and Stalin during the socialist construction process. Over the past 25 years, not only has the factory itself changed, but the people who work there have also changed and developed. The lives of the factory's employees have been enriched in all aspects. New and progressive people are emerging in the process of creative and constructive labor. The differences between intellectual and manual labor are disappearing. On average, almost one in three employees of the factory is studying. The development of the Stalin Automobile Plant vividly demonstrates the constant concern of the Bolshevik Party and the Soviet government for improving the material well-being and cultural standards of the working people. In addition to building 179 employee residences, the factory also has its own rest homes, sanatoriums, children's welfare organizations, and cultural palaces, with approximately 1,500 workers studying in various classes held at the cultural palace.

    【新华社北京二十二日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：十一月十九日是莫斯科斯大林汽车工厂的二十五周年纪念日。二十五年以前，苏联这个第一个汽车工厂叫做“阿模”汽车工厂，它为苏维埃国家第一次生产了十辆苏联造的大卡车。二十五年来，该工厂已发生了巨大的变化，它已经发展成为头等的大工厂，在发展苏联汽车制造工业方面起着最重要的作用。斯大林汽车工厂现正生产上千上万辆的上等大卡车、客车和舒适的公共汽车。
    苏联各报广泛纪念该工厂光荣的二十五周年。真理报社论指出：斯大林汽车工厂的成长的历史，明显地反映着我国人民在列宁、斯大林党英明的领导下，在社会主义建设过程中所造成的巨大变化。二十五年来，不仅工厂本身起了变化，而且在那里工作的人们，也有了变化和发展。该厂职工的生活在各方面都丰富了。在创造性的建设性的劳动过程中涌现出新的进步的人民。智力劳动与体力劳动的差异正在消失中。该厂员工平均几乎每三个人就有一人在学习。斯大林汽车工厂的发展，生动地证明着布尔什维克党与苏联政府对提高劳动人民的物质福利与文化水准的经常关心。除已建筑了一百七十九座职工住宅之外，该厂还有自己的休息所、疗养院、儿童福利组织和文化宫，约有一千五百名工人在文化宫开办的各个学习班里学习。
