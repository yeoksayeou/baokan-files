　　Beijing Department Stores Establish Joint Production and Sales Operations with Public and Private Factories
　　[Beijing News] Department stores in Beijing have established joint production and sales relationships with public and private factories. Companies such as Wangfu, Huafu, Yihe, Hongfeng, and Dahua have separately negotiated with some private knitwear, soap-making, and weaving and dyeing factories in the city for department stores to pick up goods directly from the factories. The method of purchasing with cash has been changed to consignment sales, with factories making small profits for sales in order to circulate capital for re-production, so the commodity prices are generally reduced by about 5 percent, and sales volumes have increased. Among them, Huafu and Wangfu companies have also established consignment sales relationships with the Tianjin Municipal Public Enterprise Company's rubber factory, knitting factory, and woolen mill. The prices are set by the Tianjin Enterprise Company, and institutions and cooperative societies can enjoy a discount of about 5 percent as per the preferential treatment offered by the Tianjin Enterprise Company when purchasing. Since the implementation of this method, it has helped the sales of products from public and private factories, and the business of department stores has gradually prospered. For example, the turnover of Wangfu Department Store in September and October has increased compared to August.

　　京百货业与公私营工厂
  　建立产销联合业务
    【北京讯】本市百货业与公私营工厂建立产销联合的业务关系。王府、华府、怡和、宏丰、大华等公司已分别与本市私营针织、造胰、织染等业部分工厂商定百货公司到工厂取货办法，由用现款批购改为委托代售，工厂则薄利推销，以周转资金进行再生产，因此商品售价一般约减低百分之五左右，销售量增多。其中华府、王府两公司并与天津市公营企业公司橡胶厂、针织厂、毛织厂建立代销业务关系，售价由天津企业公司规定，机关团体合作社购买时可照天津企业公司减低约百分之五的优待办法折扣。这办法实行以来，帮助了公私营工厂产品的推销，而百货业的业务也逐渐兴盛，如王府百货公司九、十两月份流水额均比八月份增加。
