Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 23rd: The full text of the speech given by Korean representative Choi Kyung-deok, Chairman of the General Federation of Trade Unions of North Korea, at the Beijing People's Conference celebrating the success of the Asian-Australasian Trade Union Conference:

Dear comrades!

Workers and people of all circles in Beijing, the capital of New China!

Today, I have the opportunity to express my warm comradely respect on behalf of the entire Korean working class to the heroic Chinese people who, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, have won a great victory. I feel the greatest honor and joy.

The Chinese people have driven away foreign imperialists, defeated the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary bandits, and established a new state of people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class—the People's Republic of China—on the vast Chinese territory that holds a quarter of the world's population. This great victory won by the Chinese people is a brilliant page not only in the history of the Chinese revolution but also in the national liberation movements of all colonial and semi-colonial countries in Asia and Australia, as well as in the struggle for peace and democracy throughout the world. It is a great victory in world history.

This victory won by the Chinese people signifies a huge change in the struggle between the two camps sharply opposed on the international stage after the war—the imperialist reactionary camp and the anti-imperialist democratic camp; that is, it signifies the most serious defeat of the reactionary camp and the epoch-making victory of the democratic camp. It is a new historical turning point in the national liberation struggles of the anti-imperialist colonial and semi-colonial peoples.

The brilliant victory of the Chinese People's Revolution is a great encouragement and gives powerful strength to those countries geographically adjacent, especially the Korean people, who have had close relations with China for decades and have stood together in the struggle against the common enemy of foreign aggressors.

We, the Korean working class and the Korean people, regard the victory won by the great Chinese working class and the Chinese people as our own victory, and express the most fervent cheers and celebrations. The struggle of the Korean people for the unification and independence of the motherland and the integrity of the territory, with the unanimous support and solidarity of the great Soviet people and all freedom-loving people in the world, and especially inspired by your epoch-making victory—the Chinese people—is developing and consolidating rapidly.

Today, the Korean people, united as one for their future great victory, are fighting for the peaceful unification of the motherland.

Today, the world reactionary camp, headed by US imperialism, because the Chiang Kai-shek regime, which has always been its largest base for implementing aggression, has collapsed, is attempting to strengthen the reactionary rule of various countries in South Korea, Indonesia, Malaya, and Burma with the most brutal fascist means. But this conspiracy cannot be realized; under the banner of lasting world peace, democracy, freedom, and independence, the people of the world have united like steel. The strength of our fighting ranks is great and cannot be destroyed by any force.

The desire of the imperialist group to rule the world is a dream and will never be realized. Final victory belongs to the working class and freedom-loving people all over the world. This is an indelible and clear truth.

Finally, I am convinced that the future of the Chinese working class and the Chinese people, who are fighting within Chinese territory to eliminate the remaining reactionary forces and for the permanent prosperity and strength of the new People's Republic of China, is very bright. Here, I express my infinite respect and celebration to the great new China.

1. Long live the steel-like unity of the working classes of all countries in the world, headed by the great Soviet Union, and the Chinese people!
2. Long live the permanent unity of the Chinese and Korean people!
3. Long live the People's Republic of China!
4. Long live Chairman Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese people!
5. Long live the World Federation of Trade Unions, the banner of unity of the working people of the world!
6. Long live the great leader and teacher of the working people of the world, the wise Generalissimo Stalin!

　　中国人民革命辉煌胜利给予朝鲜人民强大力量
　　朝鲜代表崔璟德讲话
    【新华社北京二十三日电】朝鲜代表、北朝鲜职业总同盟委员长崔璟德在北京各界人民庆祝亚澳工会会议成功大会上讲话全文如下：亲爱的同志们：
    新中国的首都北京的全体工人们和各界的人民！
    今天我有机会以全体朝鲜工人阶级的名义，向在中国共产党和毛泽东同志的领导下，争取了伟大胜利的英勇的中国人民，致以热烈的同志的敬意，使我感到最大的光荣和欢喜。
    中国人民赶走了外来帝国主义者，打垮了蒋介石反动匪帮，在拥有世界人口的四分之一的广大的中国领土上，树立了由工人阶级领导的人民民主专政的新国家——中华人民共和国。中国人民争取到的这一个伟大的胜利，不仅在中国革命斗争史上，并且在亚洲及澳洲所有殖民地半殖民地的民族解放运动以及全世界和平民主的斗争史上，都是灿烂的一页，它是世界历史上一个伟大的胜利。
    中国人民争取的这一胜利，意味着战后国际舞台上尖锐地对立着的两个阵营——就是在帝国主义的反动阵营和反帝国主义的民主阵营——间的斗争，已起了巨大变化；也就是意味着反动阵营的最严重的失败和民主阵营的划时代的胜利，是反帝国主义的殖民地半殖民地人民的民族解放斗争上的新的历史的转变。
    中国人民革命的辉煌胜利，对那些在地理上接壤的国家，特别是几十年来与中国具有密切关系，而且在反对共同的敌人外来侵略者的斗争上站在一起的朝鲜人民，乃是一个很大的鼓励，并给予了强大的力量。
    我们朝鲜工人阶级和朝鲜人民，把伟大的中国工人阶级和中国人民争取到的胜利，看做是自己的胜利，表示了最狂热的欢呼和庆祝。朝鲜人民为了祖国的统一独立和国土完整而进行的斗争，在伟大苏联人民以及全世界爱好自由人民的一致声援和支持下，特别在你们——中国人民的划时代的胜利的鼓舞之下，正急剧地发展着和巩固起来。
    今天朝鲜人民，为着自己将来的伟大胜利团结一致，为祖国的和平统一而斗争着。
    今天以美帝国主义为首的世界反动阵营，因为一向作为他实行侵略的最大据点的蒋介石统治已经崩溃，所以在南朝鲜、印尼、马来亚、缅甸各处，企图用最残酷的法西斯手段来加强各国的反动统治。可是这种阴谋是不可能实现的；在世界持久和平、民主、自由、独立的旗帜下，全世界人民已经钢铁般团结起来了。我们的战斗队伍的力量是伟大的，是任何力量都不能加以摧毁的。
    帝国主义集团想统治全世界的欲望，乃是梦想，是绝不会实现的。最后的胜利是属于全世界的工人阶级和爱好自由的人民的。这是不可泯灭的明确的真理。
    最后我确信，在中国领土内为了扫荡残余的反动势力同时为了新的中华人民共和国的永久的繁荣和富强而斗争着的中国工人阶级以及中国人民，其前途是非常辉煌的。在这里，我对伟大的新中国表示无限的敬意和庆祝。
    一、以伟大的苏联为首全世界各国的劳动阶级和中国人民的钢铁般的团结万岁！
    二、中国人民和朝鲜人民的永久团结万岁！
    三、中国人民共和国万岁！
    四、中国人民的领袖毛泽东主席万岁！
    五、全世界劳动人民团结的旗帜世界工联万岁！
    六、全世界劳动人民的伟大的领袖和导师英明的斯大林大元帅万岁！
