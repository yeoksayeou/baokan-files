　　From Tianjin Wheat Flour Purchasing and Sales Committee
  　A Look at How the State-Owned Economy Leads the Private Economy
    By our reporter Gu Weijin
    The Tianjin Wheat Flour Unified Purchasing and Sales Committee (hereinafter referred to as the Wheat Flour Purchasing and Sales Committee) is a very good organizational form for the Tianjin People's Government to implement the policy of giving consideration to both public and private interests. This form has greatly strengthened the leadership of the state-owned economy over the private economy and ensured the development of the flour industry. This is still a pioneering effort in Tianjin and even in major cities. Now it is introduced for reference by various places.
    　　　　The Emergence of the Wheat Flour Purchasing and Sales Committee
    There are forty-four private mechanized flour mills of various sizes in Tianjin. During the Kuomintang rule, the purchase price of wheat and the selling price of flour were not uniform among the mills, and there were frequent phenomena such as competitive purchasing and hoarding, which became one of the reasons for price fluctuations. At the same time, the source of wheat was affected abnormally, production was intermittent, and it was difficult to maintain reasonable profit from production. After the liberation of Tianjin, the Municipal People's Government, in view of the fact that flour has always been one of the main commodities that affect market prices, and that Tianjin market fluctuations often affect other areas in North China, in order to solve the production difficulties of the wheat flour industry in Tianjin, control the grain market, combat speculation and manipulation, and stabilize prices, in June, the Municipal State-Owned Grain Company and twenty-four large flour mills (one of which is state-owned) jointly formed the Wheat Flour Purchasing and Sales Committee. Nine members were elected by all members to form the Standing Committee. The committee elected two people as the director and deputy director (the manager of the Grain Company as the director, and the manager of Shoufeng Flour Mill as the deputy director). The remaining seven people, six are managers and factory directors of various mills, and one is the business section chief of the Grain Company. The Standing Committee has purchasing and sales staff, calculators, etc., responsible for various technical tasks.
    　　　　How to Solve the Production Difficulties of the Flour Industry
    The main task of the Wheat Flour Purchasing and Sales Committee is to take two reasonable measures to solve the production difficulties of its members. First, purchase wheat and sell flour at agreed prices. The agreed price is discussed by the members in a meeting, and a reasonable price for purchasing various types of wheat and selling various types of flour is agreed upon under the three principles of ensuring that it is beneficial to those who transport and sell wheat, those who produce flour, and consumers. The agreement goes through various scientific calculations, so that grain merchants are happy to transport wheat in a steady stream, constantly maintaining the production of flour mills; and it also guarantees that production can obtain a certain profit, so that flour continuously flows into the market, stabilizing prices. In order to guarantee the realization of the agreed price, the administration gives strong cooperation, and the Bureau of Industry and Commerce stipulates that industries that do not use wheat as a production raw material cannot purchase wheat in the market, so as to avoid raising or lowering prices.
    Second, plan the distribution of wheat and plan the sale of flour. The committee stipulates through agreement that the quantity of wheat purchased must be determined according to the size of production capacity and the amount of flour sold, and cannot be purchased competitively; the sale of flour must be appropriately adjusted according to market supply and demand, and cannot be hoarded for speculation. It is also agreed that the quantity of wheat purchased and flour sold by each mill must be registered with the committee, and the committee conducts inspections based on the registration.
    　　　　The Role of Grain Companies in Solving the Production Difficulties of the Flour Industry
    In addition to the above two methods to solve the production difficulties of its members, the Wheat Flour Purchasing and Sales Committee also relies on the strong assistance of the Grain Company. The Grain Company's approach is: First, actively carry out coordination work to take care of members' production. Under normal circumstances, the Grain Company gives priority to allowing various mills to purchase wheat, purchasing less or not purchasing themselves; when it is difficult to purchase wheat in the market, it tries its best to coordinate so that various mills can maintain production. When there is too much wheat in the market, various mills are unable to purchase it, and the Grain Company immediately purchases it to avoid affecting wheat prices from being too low. When selling flour, the Grain Company generally does not sell it to avoid affecting flour prices from being too low and flour mills from being unprofitable; when the flour of various mills cannot meet market demand, the Grain Company appropriately releases a portion to balance supply and demand and stabilize prices. Second, assist members in solving the financial difficulties in purchasing wheat from a long distance, as well as purchasing procedures and transportation difficulties by means of providing loans on their behalf. This summer, it helped flour mills purchase 2,000 bags of wheat (200 jin per bag) from Xuzhou and other places. Third, lead various mills to fight against speculation and manipulation during price fluctuations. During the major price fluctuations in July and August, various mills were worried that they would not be able to repurchase wheat after selling flour, and the Grain Company provided 540,000 jin of wheat to various mills, and the mills dared to sell flour in large quantities, stabilizing prices. When various mills sold 7,000 to 10,000 bags of flour per day but still could not meet market demand, the Grain Company sold more than 10,000 bags of flour per day to support them, reducing the activities of speculators in the flour black market. Later, farmers from the disaster areas in central Hebei transported a large amount of wheat and requested to exchange it for coarse grains. At that time, flour mills were feeling a shortage of wheat, but had no coarse grains to exchange; the Grain Company supplied flour mills with more than 1.5 million jin of coarse grains in exchange for more than 730,000 jin of wheat. In this way, the speculators' attempt to control wheat and then control flour and coarse grains failed to materialize, and the flour mills always maintained a reasonable profit from production. Fourth, vigorously assist flour mills to overcome new crises. At the end of August, traffic between Tianjin and Shanghai resumed, and flour from Shanghai and other places was transported to Tianjin for sale at lower prices, and the sales of flour in Tianjin were greatly affected; the Grain Company had helped various mills actively find ways to open up the sales channels for flour. Fifth, support various mills by means of commissioned processing. For example, Shoufeng, Dongya, Fuxing and other four major flour mills, because of their large production capacity, the raw materials currently absorbed cannot meet production needs, and the Grain Company provides them with a large amount of raw materials for processing. In this way, large mills absorb less raw materials in the market, and general small mills can absorb raw materials and sell finished products more conveniently in the market.
    　　　　Flour Industry Production Development, Organization Expansion
    Since the establishment of the Wheat Flour Purchasing and Sales Committee, the Tianjin flour industry has developed rapidly with the above-mentioned appropriate measures. Before liberation, various mills stopped work for half a year due to insufficient raw material supply; since September after liberation, they have never stopped work, and the output has also been increasing month by month. The above-mentioned 24 mills produced 414,413 bags of flour in June (including processing for the public, same below), 440,271 bags in July, and 544,935 bags in August. Compared with before liberation, the output has increased even more. Fuxing (large mill) produced 12,277 bags of flour in July last year (including processing for the public, same below), and 104,995 bags of flour in July this year; Dongya (large mill) produced 28,317 bags of flour in July last year, and 137,345 bags of flour in July this year. In order to expand operations, Yufeng Mill is now adding a drying machine, and Dongya Mill is also purchasing machines in Hong Kong. With the development of production, the organization of the association is also expanding. The association originally had 24 flour mills, and in recent months, another 21 small mills have also joined the association one after another. The association now includes all mechanized flour mills in the city.
    　　　　Preliminary Experience in the State-Owned Economy Leading the Private Economy
    1. The relationship between state-owned economic organizations (Grain Company) and private mills is not to take over everything, but to actively lead everyone to do a good job in production. This requires eliciting everyone's full opinions and thorough discussion when dealing with each issue. The association's agreement on organizational rules and regulations and the usual meetings to agree on prices all take this approach. If someone is unwilling to speak at the meeting, they can speak after the meeting or in writing. If members have opinions about the association, they can raise them with the committee, or with the Bureau of Industry and Commerce, or the Municipal Government. Everyone is satisfied when all opinions are expressed.
    2. We must carry out the policy education of giving consideration to both public and private interests, from the economic nature of the New Democracy to various specific policies. But in education, it must be combined with practical actions so that private mills truly realize that it is profitable to be under the leadership of the state-owned economy. It is not accidental that today's flour mills can unite around the Grain Company and work hand in hand with the Grain Company.
    3. The cooperation between the state-owned economy and the private economy is to develop production, regulate the market, and stabilize prices. Whoever violates this principle must be subjected to appropriate criticism. In Tianjin, a small number of private mills once attempted to raise prices and obtain exorbitant profits during price fluctuations. The Grain Company criticized them and corrected this illegal behavior, which was very necessary.
    4. In order to control the grain market and stabilize prices, it is also necessary to have the cooperation of administrative management. During the price fluctuations in July and August, the association once wholesale a large amount of flour to retailers; but the retailers controlled the flour and sold it at high prices, and the retail price was nearly double the wholesale price, resulting in a flour black market, and prices could not be stabilized. Later, the Bureau of Industry and Commerce strictly controlled the retailers, stipulating that the retail price should not exceed 15% of the wholesale price, and the retailers with mills could not purchase flour in the market, which only then took effect.
    5. It is very important to vigorously organize the strength of private merchants to serve the state-owned economy. The state-owned organs generally purchase wheat in large quantities, and transportation is also in large quantities, which has certain difficulties in capital mobilization and transportation. Therefore, the Grain Company needs to organize private merchants to purchase wheat, because they generally purchase in small quantities, the capital is easy to mobilize, and the transportation is convenient, and they can continue to transport it in small amounts and accumulate over time. In terms of raw material supply in recent months, in addition to relying on the strong support of the Grain Company, and purchasing wheat twice in Xuzhou and Bengbu, the Wheat Flour Purchasing and Sales Committee usually relies on the supply of wheat from private merchants.

　　从天津麦粉购销委员会
  　看国营经济如何领导私营经济
    本报记者  古维进
    天津小麦面粉统一购销委员会（下面简称麦粉购销委员会），是天津人民政府贯彻公私兼顾政策中一个很好的组织形式。这种形式，使国营经济对私营经济的领导大大加强，使面粉业的发展有了保证。这在天津以至各大城市说来，还是一种创举。现在把它介绍出来，供各地参考。
    　　　　麦粉购销委员会的产生
    天津有大小四十四家私营机器面粉厂。在国民党统治时期，各家收购小麦与销售面粉时价格不统一，常有争购、囤积等现象，成为物价波动的原因之一；同时影响小麦来源不正常，生产断断续续，生产的合理利润很难保持。天津解放后，市人民政府鉴于面粉向来是左右市场物价的主要商品之一，天津市场波动，常常影响华北其他地区。为解决津市麦粉业的生产困难，掌握粮食市场，打击投机操纵，稳定物价，乃于六月间由市公营粮食公司与二十四家大面粉厂（其中有一家是公营）共同组成麦粉购销委员会。由全体会员票选九人组成常委会。委会选出二人为正副主任（粮食公司经理为正主任，寿丰粉厂经理为副主任）。其余七人，有六人为各厂经理、厂长等，有一人为粮食公司的业务科长。常委会下设购销员、计算员等，负责各项技术工作。
    　　　　如何解决面粉业的生产困难
    麦粉购销委员会的主要工作，是采取两种合理的办法解决会员的生产困难。第一，以协议价格办法收购小麦和销售面粉。协议价格是由会员开会讨论，在保证运销小麦者有利、生产面粉者有利、及消费者有利的三个原则下，议定收购各种不同小麦及销售各种不同面粉的合理价格。协议中经过各种科学计算，使粮商乐于把小麦源源运来，经常维持面粉厂生产；又保证生产能获得一定利润，使面粉不断流入市场，稳定物价。为保证协议价格的实现，行政给以有力的配合，工商局规定：凡不是以小麦为生产原料的行业，不能在市场购麦，以免抬高或降低价格。
    第二，有计划的分配小麦，有计划的销售面粉。该会经过协议规定：收购小麦数量，必须根据生产能力大小及销售面粉多少来决定，不能抢购；销售面粉，必须根据市场供求情况，适当调剂，不能囤积居奇。并议定各厂收购小麦及销售面粉的数量，必须在会里登记，会里根据登记进行检查。
    　　　　粮食公司解决面粉业生产困难的作用
    麦粉购销委员会除了采取上述两种办法解决会员的生产困难外，还依靠粮食公司的大力协助。粮食公司的做法是：第一、积极进行调剂工作，照顾会员生产。在一般情况下，粮食公司尽先让各厂收购小麦，自己少购或不购；在市场购麦困难时，则尽可能调剂，使各厂得以维持生产。市场小麦过多时，各厂无力收购，粮食公司即行收购，免得影响麦价过低，在销售面粉的时候，一般情况下粮食公司不出售，免得影响面价过低，面粉厂无利可图；在各厂面粉不能满足市场要求时，粮食公司则适当吐出一部分，使供求相抵，物价稳定。第二、以代为贷款等方式协助会员解决远距离收购小麦时的资金困难，及购麦手续与运输等困难。今夏曾这样帮助面粉厂从徐州等地购到小麦二千包（每包二百斤）。第三、在物价波动期间，领导各厂与投机操纵作斗争。七八月物价大波动时，各厂担心面粉售出去购不回小麦，粮食公司拿出五十四万斤小麦供给各厂，各厂敢于大量售粉，平抑了物价。当各厂每天售粉七八千袋至一万袋仍不能满足市场需要时，粮食公司又每天售粉一万余袋来支持，减少投机分子进行面粉黑市的活动。以后冀中灾区农民运来大批小麦要求换取粗粮，当时面粉厂正感小麦缺乏，但无粗粮交换；粮食公司便供给面粉厂粗粮一百五十余万斤，换得小麦七十三万余斤。这样，投机分子企图掌握小麦，进而掌握面粉、粗粮的打算未能实现，面粉厂则始终保持了生产的合理利润。第四、大力协助面粉厂渡过新的危机。八月底，津沪交通恢复，上海等地面粉运津销售，价格较低，津市面粉销售颇受影响；粮食公司曾帮各厂积极设法打开了面粉的销路。第五、以委托加工办法支持各厂。如寿丰、东亚、复兴等四大粉厂因生产能力大，现明吸收的原料不能满足生产需要，粮食公司便给予大批原料让他们加工。这样，大厂在市场吸收原料减少，一般小厂便可在市场较方便地吸收原料，推销成品。
    　　　　麦粉业生产发展，组织扩大
    麦粉购销委员会成立以来采取了上述各项恰当地措施，津市面粉业生产迅速发展了。解放前，各厂因原料供给不上，一年有半年停工；解放后九月来，一直没有停过工，产量也在逐月提高。上述二十四厂六月份产粉四一四、四一三袋（给公家加工的在内，下同），七月份产粉四四○、二七一袋，八月份产粉五四四、九三五袋。与解放前相较，产量增加更多。：福星（大厂）去年七月出粉一二、二七七袋（给公家加工的在内，下同），今年七月出粉一○四、九九五袋；东亚（大厂）去年七月出粉二八、三一七袋，今年七月出粉一三七、三四五袋。为了扩大经营，裕丰厂现又添设烤干机，东亚厂也到香港购买机器。随着生产的发展，该会的组织也在扩大。该会原有面粉厂二十四家，数月来，又有二十一家小型厂也先后入会。现该会已包括了全市所有机器面粉厂。
    　　　　国营经济领导私营经济的初步经验
    一、国营经济机构（粮食公司）对私厂的关系，不是包办代替，而是积极领导大家把生产闹好。这就需要在处理每个问题时启发大家充分发表意见，讨论透澈。该会协议组织章程及平时开会协议价格，都是采取这种办法。如有人在会上不肯说，可以在会后说或用书面说。会员对会有意见，可以向委员提，也可以向工商局、市政府提。有意见都说出来，大家就满意了。
    二、必须进行公私兼顾的政策教育，从新民主主义的经济性质到各项具体政策。但在教育中必须与实际行动结合，使私厂真正体会到在国营经济领导下有利可图。今天面粉厂都能团结在粮食公司周围，与粮食公司携手合作，不是偶然的。
    三、国营经济与私营经济合作，是为了发展生产，调剂市场，稳定物价。谁违背了这个原则，必须进行适当的批评。津市有少数私厂在物价波动时曾企图抬高价格，获取暴利，粮食公司批评了他们，纠正了这种非法行为，这是很必要的。
    四、要想掌握粮食市场，稳定物价，还必须有行政管理的配合。七八月物价波动时，该会曾以大批面粉批发给零售商；但零售商却把面粉掌握起来，高价出售，零售价高于批发价将及一倍，产生面粉黑市，物价平抑不下来，后经工商局对零售商加以严格管制，规定零售价格不得超过批发价格百分之十五，有磨的门市商不能到市场购买面粉，才发生了效力。
    五、大力组织私商力量为国营经济服务是很重要的。国营机关收购小麦，一般是大批的，运输也是大批的，这在资金调动及运输上都有若干困难。因此，粮食公司就需要组织私商收购小麦，因为他们一般是小批的，资金好调动，运输方便，可以零星的继续不断的运来，日久积少成多。麦粉购销委员会数月来在原料供应上，除了依靠粮食公司大力支持，及自己到徐州、蚌埠购过两次小麦外，平时都是依靠私商的小麦供给。
