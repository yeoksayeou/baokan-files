　　The Economic Accounting Work of Hegang Coal Mine
    By our reporter Zhao Chun
    Hegang Coal Mine is located north of Jiamusi, with reserves of about 5 billion tons. Only 30 million tons have been mined, making it the largest coal mine with the most abundant reserves in Northeast China. This mine was liberated the earliest in Northeast China. Since August 15th, the Party and the People's Government have devoted great efforts to restore production and carry out construction under extremely difficult conditions. It currently has 31 inclined shafts (pits), 18,000 horsepower of mechanical equipment, and 12,000 employees. The average daily coal output is 6,000 tons. In the past four years, it has supported the needs of the Liberation War and industrial production with more than 4 million tons of coal, achieving remarkable results.
    The mine started economic accounting work last winter. Over the past year, it has explored the work through tortuous and complex processes, gained some experience, and encountered many lessons. This work encountered serious ideological obstacles from the beginning. The most important of these was that cadres had a supply mentality, which was manifested in their willingness to complete coal production tasks but reluctance to calculate costs. When the first step of economic accounting, asset inventory, began, they always thought that the assets left by the enemy and puppets were equivalent to free money, and whether they were inventoried or not did not matter. The meat was in the pot, and it was all the country's to be used for coal production. Therefore, at the beginning of the economic accounting work, Hegang Coal Mine focused on the ideological education of cadres, held seminars, ran short-term training courses, and organized widespread study to gradually overcome the supply mentality and establish an economic accounting mentality. Experience has shown that without repeated, in-depth, and persistent ideological struggle, economic accounting work cannot be carried out.
    Asset inventory is an extremely cumbersome work that requires precision. Careful research must be done in advance to determine the appropriate scope of inventory and the correct valuation basis; otherwise, manpower and time will be greatly wasted. When the mine was inventoried from October to December last year, it first registered assets with a lifespan of more than five years. Afterwards, it felt that the inventory scope was too narrow, so it changed it to assets with a lifespan of more than three years also needing to be registered. Therefore, it had to do a second inventory. For the valuation of assets, there was a lack of careful research from the beginning. It was first calculated according to the price of gold in the tenth year of the puppet Manchukuo Kangde, which had risen 7,000 times. Afterwards, it was felt that this price was still far from the general price increase index, and the valuation based on this was even more inaccurate. In April of this year, it was re-valued according to the price increase index as instructed by the Northeast Coal Mine Administration. After this valuation was made, the Northeast Coal Mine Administration, considering that asset valuation has a great impact on costs, once again convened the persons in charge of asset inventory from various mine administrations to conduct joint research. Finally, the Coal Mine Administration determined the valuation with designated figures, and used this as a national investment to be repaid in ten years. The valuation of the designated figures by the Coal Mine Administration was only a temporary expedient task. Accurate asset valuation still depends on precise research and calculation.
    The second step of economic accounting is to establish correct cost accounting, in order to stipulate appropriate coal prices on this basis, obtain an appropriate amount of profit from it, and accumulate national capital. At present, the cost accounting of the mine is actually only at the bureau level (the administrative structure of the mine is at the bureau, mine, and pit levels; below the pit level are the team and group production units). For example, for the use of materials, the mine receives them from the bureau and distributes them to the pits. The bureau and mine cannot really understand how much the pit actually uses and saves each month. This also makes the bureau's cost calculation inaccurate. In order to make the cost accurate, the mine bureau decided to establish pit-level cost accounting and report directly to the bureau (and report to the mine for information, but the mine level does not do cost accounting), and calculate costs according to the actual consumption of materials. The work of establishing pit-level cost accounting began last month with pilot preparation work in one pit, and was officially piloted at the beginning of this month. (This level of cost accounting actually only does recording work and is called pit-level cost accounting record.)
    In cost accounting, the so-called cost includes materials, wages, electricity, expenses, employee benefits, depreciation, and sales tax. Among them, the material cost, which accounts for 50% of the total cost, makes it difficult to establish correct cost accounting due to price fluctuations and the inability to fix the unit price of materials. In order to overcome this difficulty, the mine is now preparing to calculate costs in accordance with the instructions of the Northeast Industrial Department, based on the unified material catalog and unit price (which remains fixed for a considerable period of time) issued by the Finance and Economics Committee. Regarding the calculation of asset depreciation, since January of this year, depreciation has been temporarily added to the cost at a rate of 15% of the total cost. Because the depreciation amount is not fixed, the cost is difficult to calculate accurately. The fixed depreciation amount is being studied, and it can be used to calculate costs starting next year.
    To establish economic accounting, do a good job in cost accounting, and reduce costs, it is necessary to first make various standards and implement quota management in production. Hegang Coal Mine started quota work in May of this year, including fixing personnel, materials, quality, and quantity, called the "four fixings."
    Although the four-fixing management of Hegang Coal Mine has not yet produced quota standards that meet the actual possibilities of the mine in the past six months, it has achieved results in implementing the quota standards initially stipulated by the Northeast Coal Mine Administration, especially the personnel fixing work has been even more effective. At present, the ratio of direct workers to indirect workers (including cadres and staff) in the entire bureau has reached 4 to 6, 5 to 5 in the subordinate mines, and the number of direct workers in the pits generally exceeds 60%, and some even reach more than 70%. The beginning of this work was that the Mining Bureau proposed the standards of 4 to 6, 5 to 5, and 6 to 4, calling on all subordinate units to reduce indirect workers as much as possible and increase direct workers. Before the call, extensive publicity and education on the four-fixing management were carried out, so the workers actively participated in this work and came up with various methods to reduce indirect workers. In the first month of work (May), the entire bureau increased the number of pickaxe workers by 391, and more than 300 old, weak, and child laborers were transferred to sideline occupations. In order to reduce indirect workers, they adopted small contracting (voluntary work by direct workers during off-shifts), contracting out the work of large general workers and even the pillar carpenters of coal mining faces to small contractors. This not only turned many indirect workers into direct workers, increased coal production, and increased the wages of this group of people, but also enabled the direct workers who did small contracting to earn a portion of small contracting wages, so it was beneficial to both the public and private, and everyone was happy. The old, weak, and child laborers who were transferred to sideline occupations or other light labor such as brick and tile yards and coal selection yards still had no problems with their lives. This result is good, but certain shortcomings were also discovered in the process. Because whether the number of indirect workers can be reduced depends on the actual work needs. If the differences in the natural conditions and mechanical equipment of each pit are ignored, and it is required to reach 6 to 4 across the board, the number of indirect workers will be excessively reduced, so that they cannot bear the required work. In the pits where indirect workers were excessively reduced, due to actual work needs, the phenomenon of direct workers being registered but actually working as indirect workers occurred. Small contracting has its advantages, but it still requires a portion of wages to be paid, and it hinders workers from getting enough rest and damages their health. In the context of advocating scientific division of labor and technical specialization, small contracting will inevitably reduce work quality and is also inappropriate. After review, the Mining Bureau has further corrected these shortcomings, canceled the unified personnel quota ratio, and set specific personnel quota standards based on the specific conditions of each pit. The issue of small contracting is also under study. Labor organization is an important issue in mines. According to Soviet experience, on the one hand, it is necessary to gradually eliminate the phenomenon of idle work from personnel fixing, and on the other hand, it is also necessary to further appropriately clarify the division of labor so that labor efficiency can be fully exerted and technology can be specialized, skilled, and improved. At present, the tunneling teams in the mine do everything, including drilling, blasting, and excavating, and even loading and pushing carts. There is a lack of clear division of labor, and this also needs to be improved.
    In the work of fixing materials, Hegang Coal Mine has not achieved much. The consumption of pit wood, detonators, gunpowder, and fuse is still exceeding the standard, which is inseparable from the fact that the work of inspecting waste has not been well implemented. Although the mine conducted a half-month waste inspection in August of this year, the ideological understanding was not raised to the due height, nor was a mass movement created, so that the inspection work could not be carried out thoroughly. The phenomenon of waste is serious in Hegang Coal Mine. For example, in the loading work, due to poor labor organization and poor coal storage facilities, fines are often imposed for exceeding the time stipulated by the Railway Bureau. In the first half of this year, the fines amounted to 3.6 billion Northeast currency. In the spontaneous anti-bureaucracy of the workers in the brick and tile factory, it was found that there were 500 pieces of waste brick blanks alone. Mechanical oil was wasted by more than 100 kilograms per month. Together with the poor quality of finished products and other wastes, it totaled about 1 billion Northeast currency. The original wood inspection of the Forestry Section was not accurate, and some even calculated with the bark (the size was reduced after the bark fell off later), which was also a big waste. In terms of machinery and electricity, according to calculations in early July, improper equipment allocation wasted about 2,700 horsepower, accounting for 15% of the total horsepower of the mine's mechanical equipment. The waste of electricity can be imagined. The mine has now set a profit-sharing incentive method for saving materials, and it will be able to move forward in the work of fixing materials in the future.
    The original coal washing machine of Hegang Coal Mine is being restored. The hand-selection machine that has been repaired can select 3,000 tons per day. However, because the bottom-opening car has not yet been allocated, it mainly relies on hand selection in the pit, and a coal quality inspection station is set up outside the pit for quality management. The quality standards of not exceeding 3% of gangue and eliminating fist-sized (10 cm) stones have been achieved in the past five months. In September, the Northeast Fuel Company no longer had any returns due to substandard coal quality. The mine bureau has a quality reward and punishment method. Inspectors who find fist-sized stones give 90% of the coal price for 100% to the one who was inspected, and the one who was inspected deducts his wages according to the actual weight of the stone. Therefore, the workers pay considerable attention to quality. The ash content of the mine's coal has generally been reduced to within 20%, which is 10% lower than last year. The mine's laboratory has been established, and coal classification work is in the planning stage.
    In terms of output, a total of 1.4 million tons were mined from January to September, which is 80% of the annual task. Comparing the output of 140,000 tons in April (less than 0.5% of the monthly plan) with the output of 167,000 tons in September (exceeding the monthly plan by 17%), the effect after quantitative management can be seen. From the perspective of overall labor productivity, it was 0.51 in April, and has been above 0.56 every month since May, which has exceeded the quantitative standard of 0.03 stipulated by the Administration. This achievement is certainly related to the increase in direct workers after personnel fixing, but the main reason is the efforts of the workers themselves after quantitative management. The meritorious service movement since Red May, together with the four-fixing work, is the biggest guarantee for successfully exceeding the quantitative management. The coal miners are actively producing and competing to perform meritorious service with an unprecedented conscious sense of ownership, which greatly improves labor efficiency. The fact that the implementation of the collective work system after studying Soviet experience in September increased overall labor productivity to 0.58 (0.56 in August) points out the prospect of achieving even greater results for quota management.

　　鹤冈煤矿的经济核算工作
    本报记者  赵纯
    鹤冈煤矿位于佳木斯北方，埋藏量约五十亿吨，已采者仅三千万吨，为东北埋藏最丰的一个大矿。该矿在东北解放最久，自“八一五”后，党和人民政府即以大力于极端艰苦的条件下恢复生产，进行修建，现有斜井（坑）三十一个，机械设备一万八千马力，职工一万二千人，日产煤平均六千吨，四年来曾以四百余万吨产煤支援了解放战争及工业生产的需要，成绩卓著。
    该矿自去冬开始进行经济核算工作，一年来在曲折而复杂的过程中摸索，取得若干经验，也碰到不少教训。这一工作，一开始就遇到严重的思想障碍，其中最主要的是干部存有供给思想，它表现在只要完成产煤任务，而不愿计算成本。当经济核算第一步工作清理资产开始时，他们总以为敌伪留下的资产等于白拾，清理与否不关紧要，肉烂在锅里，用来产煤都是国家的，因此鹤冈煤矿在经济核算工作一开始，就着重干部思想教育，开座谈会，办短训班，普遍组织学习，始逐渐克服供给思想，树立了经济核算思想。经验指明，没有反复深入与坚持的思想斗争，经济核算工作是无法开展起来的。
    清理资产是一件极其繁琐而务求精确的工作，事先必须作精密研究，确定适当的清理范围与正确的估价根据，否则人力与时间均将形成很大的浪费，该矿在去年十月至十二月清理时，先按资产寿命能再延续五年以上者作了登记，事后又觉得清理面窄，改为三年以上者也要登记。因此就不得不作了第二次清理。对于资产的估价，开始即缺乏精密研究，先按伪满康德十年黄金价格上涨七千倍的价格计算，事后又觉得这个价格与一般物价上涨指数相差尚远，依此估价更不精确，至今年四月乃又按照东北煤矿管理局指示，根据物价上涨指数重定估价。此次估价作出后，东北煤管局以资产估价关系成本很大，复又召集各矿局清理资产负责人员共同研究，最后由煤管局以指定数字的估价确定下来，并以此作为国家投资，定十年归还。，煤管局指定数字的估价也只是作为一个任务性的权变办法，正确的资产估价还有赖于精确之研究与计算。
    经济核算的第二步工作是建立正确的成本计算，以便在此基础上规定适当的煤价，从中收入适当数量的利润，积累国家资本。目前该矿的成本会计，实际上还只有局一级的（该矿山的行政机构为局、矿、坑三级，坑以下即为班、组生产单位），如材料使用，矿由局领出发给坑，坑口每月实用与节余多少，局、矿不能确实了解，这也使局的成本计算不能真确。为了把成本作得真确，该矿局决定建立坑口成本会计，并直接向局报帐（同时报矿了解，但矿级不作成本计算），按材料实际消耗量计算成本。建立坑口成本会计的工作，上月开始在一个坑口作试点准备工作，本月初正式试作。（这一级成本会计实际只作记录工作，名为坑口成本会计记录。）
    在成本会计中，所谓成本是包括材料、工薪、电费、经费、职工福利、折旧费及产销税等项。其中占成本百分之五十的材料一项，因物价波动，材料单价不能固定，正确的成本核算的建立即有困难。为克服这一因难，该矿现正拟按照东北工业部指示，根据财经委员会统一印发材料目录和单价（在相当时期内固定不变）计算成本。关于资产折旧的计算，自今年一月开始即按总成本百分之十五的比例暂时折价加入成本，因折旧额未固定，所作成本也难以正确。固定折旧额正在研究，明年开始即可据以计算成本。
    要建立经济核算工作，作好成本，降低成本，在生产上一定要首先作出各种标准，实行定额管理。鹤冈煤矿是今年五月开始定额工作，包括定员、定材、定质、定量，称为四定。
    鹤冈煤矿的四定管理，半年来虽尚未作出符合本矿实际可能的定额标准，但在执行东北煤管局初步规定的定额标准上，则已获成绩，尤其定员工作收效更大。现在全局直接工与间接工（包括干部职员在内）的比率已作到四与六之比，所属各矿为五比五，坑口直接工所占数字则一般的都超过百分之六十，有的甚至高达百分之七十以上。这一工作的开始是矿务局提出四比六、五比五、六比四的标准，号召所属各单位尽量使间接工减少，把直接工增多。号召之前曾广泛进行了四定管理的宣传教育，因而职工们积极地参加了这一工作，想出多种办法把间接工减少。工作开始的第一个月（五月份），全局即增加刨镐手三九一名，另有三百余老弱童工转移副业。他们为了减少间接工，而采用小包工（直接工歇班时自愿的作），将大杂工甚至采煤掌子的支柱木匠活包给小包工作，这不仅使很多间接工转成直接工，增加了产煤量，提高了这一批人的工资，而且作小包工的直接工也因此多获一部分小包工工资，所以公私两利，人人欢喜。转入副业或其他如砖瓦场、选炭场等轻劳动的老弱童工，生活仍无问题。这一成绩是好的，但在进行中也发现了一定的缺点，因为间接工的能否减少还要看实际工作的需要情形来决定。如果不顾各坑口自然条件与机械设备的差别，一律要求作到六比四，把间接工过分减少，以致担负不了需要作的工作。在间接工过分减少的坑口，由于实际工作需要，有的竟发生直接工在籍而实作间接工的现象。小包工固然有其好处，但仍然要付一部分工资，且有碍工人足够的休息，损害其健康。在提倡科学分工技术专业化的情况下，小包工必然使工作质量降低，也是不恰当的。这些缺点，经检讨后，矿局已进一步作改正，取消统一的定员比率，按各坑口具体条件定出具体的定员标准，小包工问题亦在研究中。劳动组织在矿山是一个重要问题，根据苏联的经验，一方面要从定员中逐渐消灭窝工现象，另方面还需要进一步适当的明确分工，使其劳动效率得以充分发挥，技术得以专门熟练与提高。而现在该矿的掘进小组，干活是一揽子，打眼、放炮、刨掘混在一起，甚至还要装车、推车，缺乏明确分工，此点亦需改进。
    在定材工作上，鹤冈煤矿成绩不大，坑木、雷管、火药、导火线等迄今仍超出标准，此与检查浪费工作的没有很好贯彻是分不开的。今年八月，该矿虽曾作过为时半月的浪费检查，但思想认识上并未提到应有的高度，亦未造成群众性的运动，以致检查工作未能彻底进行。浪费现象在鹤冈煤矿是严重存在的，例如装车一项，因劳动组织不好以及储煤场设备不良，时常超过铁路局规定时间而受罚，今年上半年罚款竟达东北币三十六亿之巨。在砖瓦场工人自发的反官僚主义中，即发现仅砖坯废品就有五百块，机械用油每月浪费一百余斤，加上成品质量不好及其他方面的浪费，共计约东北币十余亿元。林业科原木检尺不精确，有的甚至连皮计算（日后皮脱尺码减少），浪费也很大。机电方面，据七月初计算，机械配备不当浪费约二千七百马力，占全矿机械设备马力的百分之十五，电字浪费可以想见。该矿现已定出节约材料提成奖励办法，今后在定材工作上当可向前推进一步。
    鹤冈煤矿原有选煤机正在恢复，已修好之手选机每天可选三千吨，惟因底开门车尚未拨到，目前主要依靠坑内手选，并于坑外设有煤质检查所，进行定质管理。五个月来坩子石不超百分之三并消灭拳头大（十厘）石头的定质标准是作到了，九月份东北燃料公司已无煤质不够标准的退货送回。该矿局定有定质奖惩办法，检查员查出拳头大石头九分给十分的煤价，被查出者则按石头实重的煤价扣其工资。因之，工人在定质上是相当注意的。该矿煤质所含灰分一般已减至百分之二十以内，比去年低百分之十。现该矿化验室已经建立，煤质分类工作在计划中。
    在产量上，一月至九月共采一百四十万吨，已完成全年任务百分之八十，以四月份产量十四万吨（不足当月计划百分之○·五）与九月份产量十六万七千吨（超过本月计划百分之十七）作比，即可看出定量后的效果。从全员能率看，四月份为○·五一，而五月份以来每月均在○·五六以上，即已超过管理局规定的定量标准○·○三。这一成绩，固然与定员后直接工增加有关系，但主要的还在于定量后工人本身的努力。与四定工作同时，红五月以来的立功运动是胜利超过定量的最大保证，采煤工人以空前自觉的主人翁姿态，积极生产，竞赛立功，使劳动效率大为提高。九月份学习苏联经验开始实行集体上下班制度，使全员能率提高到○·五八的事实（八月份为○·五六），给定额管理指出了日益获致更大成绩的前途。
