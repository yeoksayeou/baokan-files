　　【News from this newspaper】In the months of September and October, the Changzhou Special District of Southern Jiangsu achieved great success in its work of "Suppressing Bandits and Eliminating Special Agents, and Democratic Anti-Hegemonism." A total of 46 out of 60 armed bandits and special agents gangs in the entire district have been completely annihilated, and the remaining 14 gangs have also been partially eliminated. Most of the armed bandit and special agent cases in the cities have also been brought to justice. The farmers' associations have organized more than 320,000 members. More than 35,000 farmers' self-defense team members have been organized, and nearly 10,000 model team members. In areas where banditry was previously serious, sentry posts and watch rooms have generally been established to actively prevent, fight, and capture bandits. The work of dividing large areas into small areas, dividing large townships into small townships, and reforming the old Baojia system has also been carried out. The democratic anti-hegemony movement in various places is also gradually developing from brewing. In the entire work and movement, 10,200 members of the Communist Youth League have been developed (more than 3,000 in cities and more than 7,000 in rural areas), and the rural areas have taken on a new look. At a joint meeting of county heads and CCP county secretaries of the special district on the 22nd of last month, the achievements of the previous stage of work were summarized, and the tasks for future work were proposed: Rely on the masses, grasp the policies, and complete the autumn grain requisition task 100% to support the front lines; at the same time, combine this with rent reduction and interest reduction, fully mobilize the masses, and link this with the suppression of bandits, elimination of special agents, and anti-hegemonism to ensure the completion of the autumn grain requisition and rent reduction and interest reduction tasks.
