A worker becomes a factory director

——Visiting Wang Wenbin, Beijing Worker Delegate to the Asian-Australasian Trade Union Conference
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Yin Tong

On November 1, 1949, something happened in Shijingshan that the workers had never expected: Wang Wenbin, a worker, became the deputy director of the Shijingshan Power Plant. When the news spread throughout the factory and the entire Guangning Village, everyone was filled with astonishment and joy. The workers unanimously said, "We support our own worker factory director. Under the leadership of Wang Wenbin, we will definitely guarantee the completion of various tasks and respond to all calls." A few days later, there was more good news: Wang Wenbin was to represent Chinese workers at the Asian-Australasian Trade Union Conference. His seventy-year-old mother has been smiling all day these past few days. The thousands of workers at the Shijingshan Power Plant have truly realized that workers are now masters of their own destiny.

Wang Wenbin has 29 years of work experience, has been a member of the Chinese Communist Party for four years, has a history of arduous struggle, possesses excellent technical skills and a natural talent, and enjoys high prestige among the masses. He comes from a poor peasant family. His father died when he was only eight months old, and he and his mother relied on her needlework to survive. At around ten years old, he collected firewood and farmed the land. Later, he learned to make shoes, but he was always underfed and poorly clothed. At the age of fourteen, he came to Beijing with his mother to make a living, working as a "errand boy" for an electric light company and wealthy families for four years. At eighteen, he joined the Shijingshan Power Plant. He learned from a Guo, who was a good man and helped him carefully. In addition to technical skills, he also taught him to read Chinese and do arithmetic. Wang Wenbin participated in the installation of the second, third, fourth, and fifth generators, as well as the thirteenth and fourteenth boilers. By the time the fifth generator was being installed, he had been promoted from a common laborer to a craftsman and became one of the main people in charge of installing the fifth generator. The light and heat of the entire city of Beijing owes much to Wang Wenbin's sweat and blood. He put in the greatest effort when installing the third generator, but he did not receive a single yuan from the factory's four or five hundred yuan bonus. This planted seeds of anger and resentment in his heart. In 1927, he led workers in organizing a trade union to demand workers' welfare from the factory and to demand an audit of the accounts. He questioned, "Where did all the money go?" The struggle at that time was very sharp, and the factory organized a reactionary trade union to oppose the workers. In 1930, his thinking developed further. He attended a workers' supplementary school and met a good teacher who not only taught him algebra, geometry, physics… but also helped him politically recognize himself as a member of the working class, and the Communist Party as the vanguard of the working class leading the Chinese revolution. The revolutionary deeds of Li Dazhao and Qu Qiubai were deeply etched in his mind. After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, he secretly launched a struggle against Japanese imperialism, using various means such as organizing reading groups and basketball teams to unite the masses and enlighten the workers' class consciousness. He once helped the People's Liberation Army guerrilla forces obtain intelligence maps of the Japanese troops stationed in the western suburbs. In August 1942, he was arrested by the Japanese military police and imprisoned for more than a year. After his release, he returned to the factory as a temporary worker and was soon promoted to clerk, foreman, and assistant engineer. His eldest son, Wang Zhiheng, is also an excellent mass worker. After the Japanese surrender and before the liberation of Beijing, he worked with his father on dramas, wall newspapers, and song teams, introducing progressive books and newspapers to the workers and cultivating many progressive workers. After liberation, Wang Wenbin was elected chairman of the Shijingshan Power Plant Trade Union. His son, Wang Zhiheng, was elected secretary of the General Branch of the Youth League of the Power Plant and director of the Youth Workers' Department of the Trade Union. He later went to the Central Youth League School for study.

How does Wang Wenbin connect with the masses? Let him tell you himself. He has only one magic weapon: "Honesty." "I never tell lies. This is not much now, but it was really rare in the old society." He is loyal and honest in front of the masses. If he doesn't understand something, he asks. He uses his brain to think, and when he understands it, he immediately teaches others so that they can understand it too. Old partners who have worked with Wang Wenbin for two or three decades unanimously say, "Lao Wang has never hidden anything." He has trained many excellent technicians. He is also enthusiastic about helping people solve difficulties, whether public or private, and never hesitates. He has always been conscientious and responsible in his work, patient, and never afraid of hardship. Although he has never been to middle school or university, he understands geometry and algebra through his own study and research. Although he has never studied the principles of steam turbines, his understanding gained from experience completely matches the theory. He knows the third, fourth, and fifth generators and the thirteenth and fourteenth boilers like the back of his hand. When faced with difficult problems that no one else can solve, they go to him. Once, a wire on the shaft of the third generator was broken, and no one could find the source, so they went to him. Another time, the oil switch of the fifth generator could not be closed, and they found him, and he solved it successfully. Therefore, everyone respects and loves him.

Wang Wenbin is 46 years old this year. He grew up next to the machines and from within the masses. Now that he has become the director of the factory, the thousands of workers have only one reaction: "I am convinced and wholeheartedly support him!"

Wang Wenbin, he is truly an outstanding son of the working people!

　　工人当了厂长
    ——访问北京市出席亚澳工会会议的中国工人代表王文斌
    荫桐
    一九四九年十一月一日，石景山出了一件工人们从来没想到的大事，那就是工人出身的王文斌当了石景山发电厂副厂长。全厂里以及广宁村全村里得到这个消息之后，到处充满着惊叹和喜悦，工人们异口同声地说：“我们拥护工人自己的厂长，我们在王文斌领导下，一定保证完成各种任务，响应一切号召。”几天之后，接着又是一个好消息，王文斌代表中国工人出席亚澳工会会议。他底七十多岁的老妈妈，这几天整日笑逐颜开，石景山发电厂千百工人，已真正体会到工人是当家作主了。
    王文斌有二十九年工龄，参加中国共产党四年了，有艰苦斗争的历史，技术好，有天才，在群众中的威信很高，家庭得贫农成份，生下来八个月，爸爸就死了，依靠着妈妈给人做针线活渡日，十岁左右就检柴、种地，后来学尚鞋，吃不饱、穿不暖。十四岁时和妈妈来北京谋生，前后当了四年电灯公司和大宅门的“差役”，十八岁入石景山发电厂作工。跟一位郭师傅学作活，那时正装二号发电机，郭师傅人好，很细心帮助他，除技术外，还教他念国文算术，后来装三号机、四号机、五号机和十三、四号锅炉，王文斌都曾参与，到装五号机时，他已由长工升为工匠，成为装设五号机主要负责人之一。全北京市的发光、发热，数起功劳来，里面有王文斌不少的血汗。装三号机时，他出了最大力气，但厂里发的四、五百元奖励金，他却没有分到一元钱，于是埋下愤怒，心里不平。一九二七年领导工人组织工会，向厂方要求工人福利，要求查帐，他追究：“赚的钱都那儿去了？”当时的斗争非常尖锐，厂方又组织一个反动工会和工人对立。一九三○年他思想更发展了一步，参加工人补习班，碰上一个好老师，不单学会代数、几何、物理……而且政治上也认识了自己是工人阶级，共产党是领导中国革命的工人阶级先锋队，李大钊、瞿秋白革命的事迹深深印入脑际。抗日战争后，他暗地展开对日本帝国主义的斗争，用组织读书会、篮球队等各种各样方式团结群众，启发工人的阶级意识，他曾帮助人民解放军游击部队获得西郊日军驻扎情报地图。一九四二年八月，他被日寇宪兵逮捕，在狱一年多，出狱后又回到厂里做短工，不久升为职员、工务员、助理工程师。他的大儿子王志恒也是个优秀的群众工作者，日寇投降后到北京解放前，和他爸爸在一起搞话剧、编壁报、组歌咏队，介绍进步书报给工人们看，培养了不少进步工人。解放后，王文斌当选为石景山发电厂工会主任。他的儿子王志恒当选为发电厂青年团总支书和工会青工部长，后去中央团校学习。
    王文斌怎样联系群众呢？请他自己说吧，法宝只有一个，那就是“真实”，“我从不说瞎话，这一点现在不算什么，在旧社会里就真稀罕。”在群众面前忠诚老实，不懂就问，就用脑子思索，懂了立刻教给别人，让别人也懂。和王文斌一起干活二三十年的老伙伴，一致说：“老王向来不掩藏一分一毫”。经过他培养出来的优秀技工很多。他又热情帮助人解决困难，不管公事、私事，从不吝啬。他对工作一直是认真负责，有耐性，从不辞辛苦。虽然他没进过中学、大学，但是，经自己学习钻研，懂几何代数，对汽机上的原理虽没学过，但从经验上得来的认识跟理论完全吻合，三号机、四号机、五号机和十三、四号锅炉，他都了若指掌，碰上疑难大症，大家解决不了，就去找他。有一次三号机轴上的线烧断了，谁也找不到根源，就去找他。又一次，五号机油开关合不上了，找到他，果然都迎刃而解了。因此，大家都尊敬他爱他。
    王文斌今年四十六岁了，是从机器旁边成长起来的，是从群众里成长起来的。他当了厂长，千百个工人的嘴只有一个反应：“我心服口服，赤诚拥护！”
    王文斌，他真是优秀的劳动人民的儿子！
