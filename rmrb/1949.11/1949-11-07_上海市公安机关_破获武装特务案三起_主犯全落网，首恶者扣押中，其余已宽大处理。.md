Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, November 6th: The Shanghai Public Security Organs have recently successively uncovered three armed espionage organizations: the Kuomintang bandit gang's Military Intelligence Bureau (MIB) Mao Sen faction's "Shanghai Advance Detachment," the bandit Central Statistics Bureau (CSB) spy faction's "Chinese Kuomintang Central Committee Member Communication Bureau Assault Brigade," and the MIB faction's "Southeast People's Anti-Communist National Salvation Army Haibei Column." All masterminds have been captured. The bandit "Shanghai Advance Detachment" was directly commanded by Fu Ying, a capable henchman of the Mao Sen bandit faction. Before the liberation of Shanghai, upon Mao Sen's orders, they were responsible for arranging to infiltrate the liberated areas, successively using the false names "Kyoto-Shanghai-Hangzhou Garrison General Headquarters Jiangsu Coastal Action Corps" (code-named "7649") and the false "Jiangsu Provincial Pacification Commander-in-Chief's Office People's Anti-Communist Self-Defense National Salvation Army Coastal Fourth Column Headquarters" to carry out activities. After the liberation of Shanghai, they again used the name "Shanghai Advance Detachment" to successively dispatch spy operatives to infiltrate Shanghai, preparing to hide for a long time and attempting to organize bandit-spy armed forces in the suburbs to carry out assassinations, bombings, and other crimes. After the Municipal Public Security Bureau obtained intelligence, it immediately investigated and cracked the case, netting them all on October 15th. A total of more than 20 people were captured, including the bandit "Shanghai Advance Detachment" First and Second Battalion Commanders Hong Guankang and Li Chunlin, Assault Captain Niu Shouming, and other important figures Wang Zhuxin, Xu Kezhong, Cai Yingqi, Xiang Zhende, etc., and a large number of important exhibits such as bandit directives, letters, and weapons were seized.

The "Chinese Kuomintang Central Committee Member Communication Bureau Assault Brigade" was jointly planned by bandit CSB spies Liu Yinqiu and Xiao Guangfo, who was dispatched by the CSB to Shanghai to convey conspiracy plans. They lured CSB bandit-spies Ji Jinkang and Taihu bandit Zhang Qingwu, etc., and used threats and inducements to recruit some elements who had been spies and local ruffians, scattered soldiers, and vagrants, etc., to carry out illegal activities, attempting to disrupt urban and rural security and endanger the interests of the people. The mastermind Liu Yinqiu was once arrested by us for counter-revolutionary activities, and released after lenient treatment and education by the government. Not only did this criminal not show any remorse, but he continued to carry out counter-revolutionary activities, and even dared to privately engrave the seal of the political organs of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, falsely claiming to be someone else to cover up his counter-revolutionary conspiracy activities. He was finally detected and exposed by us. The masterminds, "Chinese Kuomintang Central Committee Member Communication Bureau Assault Brigade Secretary-General" Liu Yinqiu, Battalion Commanders Zhang Qingwu, Ji Jinkang, Gu Qinfa, Guan Fenglin, Action Group Leader Zhang Xianhao, Liaison Group Leader Hao Yuqing, and other important elements have been arrested. Among them, dozens of accomplices secretly surrendered themselves before the case was solved, performed meritorious service to redeem themselves, or voluntarily turned themselves in, and have now been released on bail.

In addition, a certain unit of the Pudong Garrison, together with the local public security organs, recently uncovered the MIB faction's "Southeast People's Anti-Communist National Salvation Army Haibei Column" armed espionage organization, arresting the column's "Second Detachment" Lieutenant Colonel Deputy Detachment Commander Li Shishan, "Second Detachment" Major Detachment Commander Li Yuejun (also known as Li Laowu), and "Second Detachment" Major Detachment Deputy Commander and First Battalion Commander Li Zhihun, and more than 200 others, who had previously been arrested by us and released after education. A paper order from the "Southeast People's Anti-Communist National Salvation Army Haibei Column Headquarters" signed by bandit "Commander Huang Baiqi" (referring to the famous female bandit leader Huang Bamei), 24 various types of guns such as pistols and carbines, 2 radios, and other materials were seized. Currently, in addition to detaining the leading reactionary elements, the remainder have been treated leniently, given centralized training and reform, or released after education.

　　上海市公安机关
  　破获武装特务案三起
    主犯全落网，首恶者扣押中，其余已宽大处理。
    【新华社上海六日电】上海市公安机关最近又连续破获国民党匪帮军统特务毛森系“上海挺进支队”、匪中统特务系“中国国民党中央党员通讯局突击总队”及军统系“东南人民反共救国军海北纵队”武装特务组织等三起，所有主犯均告落网。匪“上海挺进支队”系由毛森匪系得力爪牙富英所直接指挥，沪市解放前夕，奉毛森命令负责布置潜入解放区，先后以伪“京沪杭警备总司令部江苏沿海行动总队”（代号为“七六四九”），伪“江苏省绥靖司令部人民反共自卫救国军沿海第四纵队指挥部”名义进行活动。上海解放后，又以“上海挺进支队”名义，陆续派遣特务行动人员，潜入沪市，准备长期隐蔽并企图在郊区组织匪特武装，进行暗杀爆破等罪行。市公安局获得情报后，即行侦察，于十月十五日一网打尽。计捕获匪“上海挺进支队”第一、第二大队长洪关康、李春林，突击队长纽守明及其他重要人犯王柱馨、徐客中、蔡英祺、项振德等二十余名，并搜获匪方指令、函件、武器等重要证物甚多。

    此外浦东警备部队某部会同地方公安机关，于最近破获军统系“东南人民反共救国军海北纵队”武装特务组织，捕获前曾被我逮捕经教育后释放的该纵队“第二支队”中校副支队长李石山、“第二支队”少校支队长李岳军（又名李老五）及“第二支队”少校支队副兼该支队第一大队长李治浑以下二百余人，搜出匪“指挥黄百器”（按即著名女士匪头子黄八妹）签名的“东南人民反共救国军海北纵队指挥部”命令一纸，手枪、卡宾等各式枪支二十四支，收音机二部及其他物资一部。现除将首要反动分子扣押外，其余已宽大处理，予以集训改造或经教育后释放。
