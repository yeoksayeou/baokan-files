[Report from Our Newspaper] The female workers of the Beijing Garment Factory were incredibly happy to hear the news of the closure of the brothels. They all said, "This is really great! The elimination of this evil system allows so many women who have never seen the light of day to finally see the blue sky today." Qiao Xiuqing, a female worker from Factory One, said, "The madams are truly vicious, forcing the prostitutes to use their bodies to earn money for their personal enjoyment, regardless of whether they are sick or not, willing or unwilling. Confiscating their property is absolutely justified." The female workers from Factory Two were moved to tears when they read in the newspaper what Liu Guiying's mother, a prostitute, said: "If it weren't for the Kuomintang arresting people in Taiyuan and demanding money, who would be willing to pawn their own daughter into a brothel?" They said: If it weren't for the arrival of the Communist Party, the women imprisoned in the brothels would never be able to escape this fiery pit in their entire lives. Xu Wenzhi, a female worker from Factory One, said: Only the government under the leadership of the Communist Party can do this. In the past, didn't many "big shots" of the Kuomintang spend their days playing with prostitutes? They also demanded that the government, in addition to closing the brothels, must strictly prohibit the activities of undercover prostitutes and strengthen their education. They further hope that the women who were forced into prostitution will completely wake up, cherish their great liberation, and diligently participate in various construction tasks of the new China.
[Report from Our Newspaper] The Beijing Second People's Representative Conference passed a resolution on closing the brothels, and the Municipal People's Government swiftly implemented this resolution, which was warmly supported by teachers and students from various schools in Beijing. All the female students of Peking University were extremely happy for the liberation of these insulted and injured sisters. They said, "This is something our female students have been concerned about for a long time." Everyone unanimously stated, "The Communist Party says it and does it. The Common Program states that women should be liberated, and now there is concrete evidence of this." The female students from the Chemical Engineering Department and the Electrochemical Department of the 工学院 (Institute of Technology) also emphasized and suggested to the government that attention should be paid to the ideological education of the prostitutes who have been living inhuman lives, to inspire their awareness and encourage them to participate in productive labor. The families of the faculty and staff also expressed their opinions, believing that this is a concrete manifestation of the People's Government improving women's rights. The female students of Tsinghua University discussed this news one after another. They believe that only under the leadership of the Communist Party and the people's own government can this evil system that has existed for thousands of years be completely eliminated. The Women's Department of the Student Union of 师大 (Normal University) immediately informed all students with a loudspeaker after hearing this news and issued a written statement, expressing full support for this important measure of the municipal government. They also appealed to people from all walks of life to do their best, under the leadership of the government, to provide more care in terms of life and participation in production to these more than 1,200 female compatriots who have been insulted for a long time and are now liberated, so that they can become self-reliant.
Professors Hou Wailu, Ma Te, Yao Kekun, and teaching assistants Liu Guangxin, Lin Yuming, Liu Shujuan, and others from 师大 (Normal University) also expressed their opinions on this matter, expressing their support. (Peking University, Tsinghua University, Normal University Correspondence Group)

    【本报讯】北京市被服厂的女工们听到了封闭妓院的消息，大家高兴得了不得，都说：这真太好了，这种罪恶制度的消灭，使多少不见天日的妇女，今天见到了青天。一厂女工乔秀清说：老鸨们真是狠毒，叫妓女们用肉体换来的钱供他个人享受，不管你有病没病，愿与不愿，迫着去干，没收他们的财产是太应当了。二厂女工们从报上看到妓女柳桂英的母亲说的话：“要不是国民党在太原抓人要钱，谁愿意把亲生的女儿押到窑子’里来呢？”被感动得哭了。她们说：要不是共产党来了，被关禁在妓院的妇女们，一辈子也跳不出这火坑的。一厂女工徐纹芝说：只有共产党领导之下的政府才能这样做，从前国民党的许多“大员”们还不是整天玩妓女。她们并要求政府除了封闭妓院外，还要严密的禁止暗娼的活动，加强对她们的教育。更希望被逼为娼的妇女们，要彻底醒悟过来，宝贵自己的大翻身，勤劳生产参加各种新中国的建设工作。
    【本报讯】北京市第二届人民代表会议通过关于封闭妓院的决议和市人民政府的迅速执行了此一决议，获得京市各校师生的热烈拥护。北京大学全体女同学都为这些被污辱与被损害的姊妹们得到解放而感到万分高兴。她们说：“这是我们女同学早就关切的事情。”大家一致表示：“共产党说到就做到，共同纲领里说过要解放妇女，现在就有了具体事实表现。”工学院化工系和电化系的女同学并着重向政府建议对一向过着非人生活的妓女们要注意思想教育，启发她们的觉悟，鼓励她们参加生产劳动。教职员家属们也都发表意见，认为这是人民政府提高妇女权利的具体表现。清华大学的女同学们纷纷谈论着此一消息，她们认为只有在共产党和人民自己的政府领导之下，这个几千年来的罪恶制度才可以彻底消灭。师大学生会女同学部听到这一消息后，马上用广播筒告诉全体同学并发表书面声明，表示全力拥护市政府的这一重要措施。并吁请各界人士在政府领导下，要竭尽全力为这一千二百多个久被侮辱而今始获解放的女同胞，在生活上和参加生产诸方面，多多给予照顾，使她们能够自力更生。
