　　Labor Association Representative Meeting
  　Li Lisan's Speech
    【Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 5th】 Abstract of the speech by Li Lisan, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, at the China Labor Association Representative Meeting: The China Labor Association has made significant contributions in the fourteen years of struggle for the unity of the Chinese working class and in the struggle for the liberation of the people of China. In 1937, the Labor Association accepted the proposal of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Trade Union Federation to resist Japan, allowing trade unions from the liberated areas to join its organization, laying a preliminary foundation for the unity of the entire Chinese working class. This made a significant contribution to the cause of establishing a united anti-Japanese national front at that time. Therefore, the Labor Association aroused the hatred of the Kuomintang reactionaries. After the Jiaochangkou incident, the Labor Association was the first to suffer destruction and oppression. Many activists of the Labor Association were arrested, wanted, and expelled, while some who were willing to be running dogs of the reactionaries, such as Shui Yunxiang and his like, openly betrayed the Labor Association. However, progressive leaders in the Labor Association, such as Comrades Zhu Xuefan and Yi Lirong, did not yield to reactionary violence. On the contrary, they became more determined to take the revolutionary path and more determined to cooperate closely with trade unions in the liberated areas. Later, after Comrade Zhu Xuefan attended the Second World Federation of Trade Unions Congress, he resolutely came to the Northeast Liberated Area, and jointly with the Liberated Area Trade Union Federation and democratic trade unions in Shanghai and other places, proposed that the then-prepared Liberated Area Workers' Representative Congress be changed to the Sixth National Labor Congress. At this congress, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, which had a glorious history in the Chinese workers' movement, was restored. The Labor Association then joined the organization of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions as a group member. Therefore, the unity of the Chinese working class was further developed and consolidated. This also made no small contribution to uniting the people of the whole country against the running dog of American imperialism, the Kuomintang reactionary government, and striving for the victory of the revolution. Now, thanks to the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the cause of liberation of the people of the whole country has been victorious, and a people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class has been established. What lies before the working class is the task of leading the people of the whole country in carrying out the great political, economic, and cultural construction. If the Chinese working class is to shoulder this glorious and arduous task, it must first and foremost better organize all the workers in China. This requires the establishment of systematic industrial trade unions based on industrial principles. The comrades of the Labor Association fully understand this historical task, understand that labor association groups not organized by industrial principles are no longer suitable for objective historical needs, and automatically propose further organizational unification with the trade unions under the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. This is a proposition that directly conforms to the greatest interests of the working class and deserves the unanimous welcome and support of workers across the country. I think that the All-China Federation of Trade Unions will fully agree and accept this suggestion from the Labor Association comrades. Although the organization of the Labor Association has ended, the glorious history of the Labor Association will only be further carried forward. The comrades of the Labor Association in the big family of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions will certainly be able to further develop their fighting spirit and contribute greater strength to the great construction cause of the Chinese working class and the people of the whole country. The trade union organizations in various places should do their utmost to welcome the comrades of the local labor association to participate in various trade union work, and should treat the comrades of the labor association with fraternal love, and help them to learn and progress in their work. Any discriminatory attitude towards the comrades of the Labor Association is an impermissible sectarianism and should be severely criticized and corrected. At a time when the running dogs of American and British imperialism and the heads of reactionary trade unions in various countries are everywhere carrying out shameless divisions of workers' organizations and splitting the workers' organizations of the world and their leading body - the World Federation of Trade Unions, the further unity of the Chinese working class has great international significance. This will inevitably have a good influence and promote the cause of unity of workers all over the world, especially the workers of Asian countries. So I congratulate the success of this Labor Association Representative Meeting, and congratulate the victory of the great unity of the Chinese working class under the banner of Chairman Mao Zedong!

　　劳协代表会议上
  　李立三讲话
    【新华社北京五日电】中华全国总工会副主席李立三在中国劳协代表会议上的讲话摘要：中国劳动协会十四年来在为中国工人阶级统一的斗争中，在为全国人民解放事业的斗争中都有重大的贡献。劳协在一九三七年就接受了当时陕甘宁边区工会联合抗日的主张，使解放区工会加入自己的组织，为全中国工人阶级团结的事业奠下初步的基础。这在当时建立抗日民族统一战线的事业上有不小的贡献。因此，劳协引起了国民党反动派对它的仇视，在较场口事件以后，劳协首先遭受摧残压迫，有不少劳协的积极分子遭受拘捕、通缉和驱逐，而一部分甘作反动派走狗的分子如水云祥之流竟公开叛变劳协。可是劳协中进步的领导者如象朱学范、易礼容同志等，并没有在反动暴力面前屈服，相反的他们更加坚决地走向革命的道路，更加坚决地与解放区工会密切合作。后来朱学范同志在参加世界工联第二次代表大会以后，毅然决然来到东北解放区，并与解放区工会联合会及上海等地民主工会共同提议将当时准备召开的解放区职工代表大会改为全国第六次劳动大会。在这次大会上恢复了中国工人运动中具有极大光荣历史的中华全国总工会。劳协遂以团体会员资格加入了全国总工会的组织，因此中国工人阶级的团结事业有了进一步的发展和巩固。这对于团结全国人民反对美帝国主义的走狗国民党反动政府，争取革命胜利的事业上也是有不少贡献的。现在，由于中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导，全国人民的解放事业已经获得胜利，工人阶级领导的人民民主专政的国家已经树立起来，摆在工人阶级面前的是领导全国人民进行伟大的政治、经济、文化建设的任务。中国工人阶级要负起这个光荣的艰巨任务，首先要求把全中国工人更好地组织起来，这就必须按产业原则建立系统的产业工会。劳协同志完全了解了这个历史任务，了解了不是按产业原则组织的劳协团体，已不适合于客观历史的需要，而自动提议与全国总工会所属各工会作进一步的组织上的统一，这是直接符合于工人阶级最大利益的主张，是值得全国工人一致欢迎和拥护的。我想，中华全国总工会一定会完全同意并接受劳协同志的这种建议。劳协的组织虽然结束了，劳协的光荣历史却只会更加发扬起来，劳协的同志在全国总工会的大家庭中，一定能够更加发挥他们的斗争精神，为中国工人阶级和全国人民的伟大建国事业，贡献更大的力量。各地工会的组织应当极力欢迎当地劳协同志来参加各种工会工作，应当以兄弟友爱的态度对待劳协同志，在工作中帮助他们学习和进步。如果对劳协同志采取丝毫歧视态度，都是不可容许的宗派主义，应受到严厉批评和纠正的。在目前美英帝国主义的走狗，各国反动工会的头子，到处进行无耻的分裂工人组织、分裂世界工人的团体及其领导机关——世界工联的时候，中国工人阶级更进一步的团结是有重大国际意义的。这必然在全世界工人的团结事业上，特别是亚洲各国工人的团结事业上起着好的影响和推动作用。所以我祝贺这次劳协代表会议的成功，祝贺中国工人阶级在毛泽东主席旗帜下大团结的胜利！
