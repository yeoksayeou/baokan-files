　　But Xilu hadn't returned yet; he was still unable to advance or retreat. The next day, Yubao really led Niubao to sincerely apologize to him, saying a bunch of nice things, which made him even more uncertain and confused. After they left, he anxiously punched himself in the chest. After a while, he felt his head heavy and his throat itchy. He quickly covered his head with both hands and squatted down, coughing repeatedly for a while, coughing up a mouthful of bright red blood. He felt dizzy and his vision blurred. He quickly climbed onto the bed, pulled the quilt over his head, and fell asleep.

　　Da San got sick just like that. At this time, he didn't have much money, and there wasn't much oil, salt, rice, or flour at home. Shuancheng, Xiaoyangui, and the Liugou family visited him, but they couldn't help. Only Yubao bought him half a pound of noodles when he came to inquire about him. Tianlu and his wife also had nothing to spare. They saved two pennies as if scraping scraps from their teeth and bought some white flour, which was eaten up in two days. Da San said that he still had some pumpkins growing in his field. Tianlu ran to pick them, but Shuancheng secretly told him, "I don't know who the heartless person was who stole them all!" Shuancheng then picked a few melons from his own field and gave them to Tianlu. Tianlu didn't dare tell Da San. He secretly saved a few pennies and bought some incense and candles to make a vow at the Old Lord Temple, but it didn't help. Da San's rosy complexion turned into a gray, collapsed face, and only skin and bones were left on his wrists. Later, it was Xilu who came back and invited a doctor from Yangquan to see him and prescribe medicine. Xilu himself also visited him twice, comforting him with gentle words. Only then did Da San slowly recover. Xilu also bought him eggs and noodles. Da San rested and recuperated day by day, and his body slowly gained weight again, and his face showed a little rosy glow. The illness was considered cured, but he lost more hair, and the top of his forehead became a bald patch.

　　Seventeen Threats

　　While Da San was sick, one or two months passed without realizing it. Time flew like an arrow, and it was after autumn. The mine was about to start work again. While Xilu was busy gathering shareholders and partners, he urged Da San to get started. Da San suffered a bout of illness and felt that Xilu had saved him. Yubao also finally declared that he would let him do it, so his anger subsided a bit. He was embarrassed to say he wanted to leave, so he began to plan the business.

　　Da San spent all day inspecting, calculating, and measuring inside and outside the large kiln, and discussing and consulting with experts. After seven or eight days, he had a rough idea in his mind, so he found Xilu and together they estimated how much labor and capital this large kiln would cost, making a detailed plan from the bottom up.

　　Xilu was not very happy at this time. Originally, the people who had agreed to pool shares with him to start the kiln in the spring suddenly became evasive for some reason. You gave this reason, he gave that reason, all as if they didn't want to do it! Xilu was very dissatisfied with this kind of untrustworthy behavior, but at the same time, he wondered: Could there really be some kind of entanglement here? He was undecided when he ran into Da San, whose estimated cost of opening the kiln was quite large, requiring two or three hundred hard currency. He couldn't do this on his own. So he looked troubled and said some unpleasant words. Da San looked at his posture and was not very happy. He quickly said, "Brother Xilu! This time is not the same as last year. If it's just digging a kiln opening and hauling some coal in winter and spring, that's nothing. But this is a ventilation shaft! Look, to drill a hole through two black holes, we have no machines and no technology. I only have a compass, relying on two bare eyes, and we have to prevent water and fire! In terms of spending money and labor, isn't it right to prepare for the worst? Anyway, once we get started, I'll try my best to save!" Xilu said, "I know that too. But Lin Bao and the others said they'd do it, and now they don't want to! I can't prepare that much all at once! I told you to think about it earlier, but you never acted. Look at this now..."

　　At this time, Yubao came. Xilu turned around and discussed it with him. He said, "Da San's estimate is right. This rural earthen kiln ventilation shaft is no ordinary matter. We've heard how many people have lost their fortunes doing this for generations!" Xilu said, "We have Da San's skills, so we don't have to worry about failing. I trust him." Da San quickly said, "Brother Xilu, you're not being fair! Anyway, I'm selling my life to do it for sure, but this is not like you using an abacus. We can't guarantee that it will definitely succeed. Anyway, Yubao is here too! In theory, this business should have been returned to him, but he didn't want it. Now we're all here face to face, I'll still let Yubao do it. I won't leave, I'll just be an idle foreman! Maybe Yubao can guarantee to do it well and spend less capital!" Yubao quickly said, "Grandpa Da San, look at you, you, you! I really sincerely want to be your apprentice! Do you want me to take out my heart, liver, lungs, and intestines for you to see?" Xilu was also unhappy and quickly said, "Da San, why are you so narrow-minded? Why are you still talking about this?" Da San didn't say anything, but Yubao asked Xilu, "Are we going to put on a show again this time?" Xilu said, "Still putting on a show! Alas! Yubao, didn't you ask Jibao last time? He just doesn't want to invest!" Yubao said, "That's right!" Da San quickly said, "Brother Xilu, why do you still want to bring Jibao in as a shareholder? Why is that?" Xilu didn't say anything, only saying, "I'll think about it and see!" Da San and Yubao then left.

　　At this time, someone outside was yelling and shouting as he walked in. It turned out to be Gan Danao. As soon as he entered the door, he laughed loudly and said, "Grandpa Xilu! I heard that your big kiln is about to start work! Haha! A great event! Congratulations, congratulations!" Xilu quickly smiled and offered him a seat, water, and a cigarette. Gan Danao didn't sit down and kept laughing, saying, "Old Grandpa! You treat my great-grandson so kindly, are you asking me to live two years less? Haha! I won't sit down! I'm here to bring a message. My uncle said: Your big kiln is a major event that hasn't happened in our village for decades. His old man's intention is that our commune should put on three big shows to properly respect the Old Lord, which can also be regarded as congratulating you; his old man also said that he wants to personally go to the temple to kowtow!" Xilu quickly said, "I wouldn't dare! I don't have that much wealth, I'm afraid I can't afford it." Gan Danao said, "Hey, stop saying that, just do it like that! You decide on a date and tell my uncle." After speaking, he walked out, laughing again, "Old Grandpa, you might have to invite a guest too! If you're inviting guests, you can't forget to ask me to help organize it! We'll also get a little bit of the limelight and have a drink, haha!" Xilu hurriedly remembered something and chased after him, grabbing Gan Danao, "Hey, brother, don't go! I have something to say. This time when rolling the kiln, Da San calculated that the capital outlay was too large, and it just so happened that I wasn't well-off, you see..." Gan Danao hurriedly interjected, "Haha, Old Grandpa! Don't be afraid to say something funny! You have shops, businesses, real estate, land, and also a lot of shares, what are you hiding from us? Haha! Uh... Besides, didn't you ask Yubao to talk to my uncle earlier? My uncle said that he has also been tightening his belt these two years. Hey! You see, this is... You old man will always have a way, right? Haha!" Gan Danao left laughing like that.

　　黑石坡煤窑演义（１８）
    康濯
    但喜禄还没有回来，他还是前进不得后退不能。第二天，玉宝又真的领着牛宝，给他正正经经暗了个不是，说了一堆好话，闹得他更是五心不定，不知是怎么回事；他等人家走了，急得使拳头捶着自己胸脯；一会，他只觉头沉沉地，嗓子眼里发痒，忙两个巴掌抱住脑袋，往地下一圪＠，连连咳了一阵，咳出来一口红鲜鲜的血，不觉头眩眼花，他赶紧爬上炕，拉过被子就蒙头睡。
    大三就这么病了。这时，他没什么钱，家里油盐米面也不多，拴成、小洋鬼、柳沟家们去看望他，也没法帮助，只有玉宝去问候他的时候，给买了半斤挂面；天禄两口子也是要什没什，他们象从牙缝里刮渣子一样省下两个钱，给买了点白面，不两天又吃光了；大三说他地里还结了些窝瓜，天禄跑去摘，拴成悄悄告他道：“不知哪个不长良心的给偷了个光！”拴成就从自己地里摘了几个瓜给天禄；天禄不敢告给大三，只又省了几个钱，偷偷买了点香烛，去老君庙许了个愿，却也不顶事，眼见大三红光满面变成了一脸灰塌塌，手腕上只剩得皮包骨头。后来还是喜禄回来了，才从阳泉请来医生给瞧病抓药，喜禄自己也去看望了他两回，软言软语宽他的心，大三这才慢慢好起来；喜禄又给买了鸡蛋挂面，大三一天天养息着，身子才又慢慢长了肉，脸上也显点红光，病算是好了，只是头发脱得更多，脑门顶变成了一块秃头皮。
　　十七　威胁
    大三闹病当中，不觉过了一两个月，日子象箭，一射就是秋后；窑上又该着动工了。喜禄一边忙着碰股子拉伙计，一边就催大三下手。大三遭了一场病，觉得是喜禄救了他，玉宝又最后声言让他干，他气也平了平，也不好意思说走，就盘算开了营生上头的事。
    大三整日在大窑里外左右察看、算计，又找懂行的商议、捣拉，闹了七八天，心里有了个谱谱，便寻见喜禄，和他一道估量这大窑得花多少工多少垫本，往细致里打底底作计划。
    喜禄这时却正不大痛快。原来春起约好和他碰股滚窑的人，不知怎么忽然推推脱脱的，你说这个缘由，他说那个道理，都象是不想干了！喜禄挺不满意这种不讲信实的事，同时却又揣摸着：莫非这里头还真有什么纠缠不成？他正心思不定，碰上大三算计的开窑的花销又挺大，得二三百块硬的；这靠他一个人可哪能办到？于是他脸上为难，嘴上也就说了些不大好听的话。大三看着他这架势，也不大高兴，忙说：“喜禄哥！这回不比去年。要光是凿个窑口、担开行道冬春出点炭，那没什么；可这是透风筒！你看，打两个黑窟窿里要恰好凿穿一个洞，咱们一没机器二没技术，我只有个定南针，凭两只肉眼，还得防水防火！这花钱花工上头，不往大里防备点还行？反正动弹开了，我紧着省吧！”喜禄道：“这我也知道。可林宝他们说好了又不想干了！我一个人，一时就能准备那么些？我早叫你合计，你又老不动手，你看这如今……”
    这时玉宝来了。喜禄回头跟他商量，他说：“大三爷估量的也对。这乡下土窑透风筒，可不是平常事。咱祖祖辈辈听说过多少干这赔光了家当的啊！”喜禄道：“咱这是大三的把式，那倒甭结记透不开，我信的过。”大三忙道：“喜禄哥你这就不在行道了！我反正保险卖命干，可这事不比你拨算盘子，咱可不敢说准定保险闹成。”说着，他又回头看着玉宝对喜禄说：“喜禄哥，这不是玉宝也在！按说，咱这营生本该退给他干的，可他怎么也不。这会咱们三头对面，我还让玉宝干，我不走，当个闲工头也行！玉宝也兴能保险干好还少花垫本的！”玉宝忙道：“大三爷你看你你你！我可实是心甘情愿跟你当徒弟啊！你非叫我掏出心肝五脏给你看？”喜禄也不高兴，忙说：“大三，你这人怎么这么小心眼？还说这作啥？”大三不言声了，玉宝却问喜禄道：“这回还得唱台戏吧？”喜禄说：“还唱戏哩！唉！玉宝，你那回不是问过聚宝？他就是不入股么？”玉宝说：“可不！”大三忙道：“喜禄哥，怎么你还想拉聚宝入股子？那为什么哩？”喜禄没说什么，只道：“我盘算盘算再看吧！”大三玉宝就走了。
    这时，外面有个什么人嚷着叫着走了进来，原来是干大脑。他一进门就哈哈笑着大声大气说：“喜禄老爷爷！听说你这大窑就要动工呀！哈哈！大喜事！恭喜恭喜！”喜禄忙笑着让坐倒水拿烟，干大脑不坐，还是一个劲笑着说：“老爷爷！你看你对我这曾孙孙还这么款待，你是叫我少活二年么？哈哈！不坐不坐！我是来捎句话。我叔说：你这大窑可是咱村几十年不遇的大事，他老人家的意思，是咱社里给唱三台大戏，好好敬敬老君爷，也算是给你贺喜；他老人家还说，他也要亲自上庙叩头哩！”喜禄忙道：“那可不敢！我可没那么大富贵，就怕我可担待不起。”干大脑道：“嗨，快别说啦，就这么吧！你看定个日子，再告给我叔好了。”说完，他就往外走，一边又哈哈笑道：“老爷爷，你怕还得请一台客吧！要请客嘛，可不能忘了叫我帮忙张罗啊！咱也沾点光喝杯酒呀，哈哈！”喜禄慌慌张张地想起了个事，忙追上去抓住干大脑道：“喂，兄弟，别走！我有句话。这回滚窑，大三计算垫本太大，正赶上我手头又不宽裕，你看……”干大脑忙插嘴道：“哈哈，老爷爷！不怕咱说句耍笑话！你商号买卖房产地亩什么也有，又还碰了好些股子，你还瞒哄咱们作啥呀？哈哈！呃……再说，早先你不是托玉宝跟我叔说过？我叔说他这二年也是紧着腰带过日子的。嗨！你看，这可是……你老人家总归会有办法的吧！哈哈！”干大脑就这么笑着走了。
