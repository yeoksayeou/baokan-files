	Beijing Municipal Court Held Investigative Hearing Yesterday
	Public Trial Tomorrow Morning
[Beijing News] Regarding the case of Redland, a British English teacher at Chongde Middle School in this city, verbally abusing student Lu Zuyi, spitting on students Tan Yu, Li Shaokang, Kang @, Bai Lianji, etc., and publicly insulting the Chinese people, the Municipal People's Court accepted the case and dispatched personnel to the school for investigation on the 14th. Subsequently, an investigative hearing was held at the school yesterday (16th) at 2:30 PM. After Judge He Zhanjun announced the opening of the court, the defendant Redland was ordered to leave the court. The plaintiff, Lu Zuyi, then recounted the circumstances of being insulted, followed by supplements from the plaintiff's agent and related parties. The plaintiff's statement concluded around 3 PM, and the plaintiff left the court. Then, the defendant was questioned about the situation at the time, but the defendant tried hard to quibble, and there were many contradictions in his words. At 5 PM, the judge announced that the investigation had come to an end. The Municipal People's Court believes that the facts of the defendant Redland insulting students and publicly insulting the Chinese people are already clear. In order to prevent the defendant from absconding, the court ordered Redland to be released on bail, and the principal of Chongde Middle School, Ling Xianyang, came forward to provide a guarantee, promising that the defendant would be available whenever summoned. Furthermore, the Municipal People's Court has decided to publicly try this case at the court at 9:30 AM on the 18th of this month, and relevant departments and student representatives from various schools will be invited to attend the hearing.

　　处理芮德兰辱骂学生案
  　京市法院昨开调查庭
  　明日上午公开审讯
    【北京讯】本市崇德中学英籍英语教员芮德兰辱骂该样学生卢祖翼、唾吐学生檀煜、李绍康、康＠、白连集等并公然侮辱中国人民案，市人民法院受理后，曾在十四日派员赴该校调查，续于昨（十六）日下午二时半在该校开调查庭。审判员贺战军宣布开庭后，即令被告芮德兰退庭，由告诉人卢祖翼陈述被侮辱时情况，继由告诉人代理人及关系人作补充，至三时许告诉人陈述完了，原告退庭。继讯问被告当时情形，但被告极力狡辩，谈话中矛盾处甚多。至下午五时，审判员宣布调查告一段落。市人民法院认为被告芮德兰侮辱学生并公然侮辱中国人民事实，业已明显。为防止被告有逃匿之虞，当庭令芮德兰取保，当由崇德中学校长凌贤扬出面具保，保证被告随传随到。又：本市人民法院已决定本月十八日上午九时半在法院公开审讯此案，届时并邀请有关机关及各校学生代表出席旁听。
