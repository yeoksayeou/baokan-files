    Beijing Private Juxingcheng Commercial Bank
    Labor-Management Dispute Resolved with Agreement
    [Beijing News] The Beijing branch of the private Juxingcheng Commercial Bank stopped issuing autumn festival subsidies to its employees this year, causing dissatisfaction among the labor force and leading to a dispute. After mediation and persuasion by the city's Labor Bureau, both parties finally reached an agreement based on the principles of mutual benefit for labor and management and jointly maintaining and developing business. Both parties submitted the agreement to the Labor Bureau for record on the 9th.
    Before liberation, the Beijing Juxingcheng Commercial Bank had always provided employees with a subsidy equal to one month's salary during the Dragon Boat Festival and Mid-Autumn Festival every year. After liberation, the bank, citing a notice from the head office, stopped issuing the Mid-Autumn Festival subsidy to employees this year. However, other private banks of the same nature in Beijing and Tianjin, such as Kaiyuan, Jianye, Dalu, Zhongnan, and Yanye banks, which had this system in the past, still issued the subsidy this year. Based on the above situation, the labor force negotiated with the management several times without success. With the help of the Eighth District Federation of Trade Unions, both parties conducted consultations, but the bank's manager, Li Peizhi, refused on the grounds that "this was decided by the Shanghai head office, and I cannot be responsible," resulting in the failure of the consultation. In the middle of last month, the Eighth District Federation of Trade Unions transferred the case to the Municipal Labor Bureau for handling. After accepting the case and understanding the crux of the dispute, the bureau put forward mediation suggestions to both labor and management based on the policy of mutual benefit and the actual situation, and hoped that the management would maintain the employees' existing welfare facilities before the collective contract of private banks in the city was signed. After several mediation and persuasion sessions, both parties expressed their willingness to abide by the government's policies and resolve the issue through self-negotiation. Because the labor force took into account the difficulties of the management and voluntarily reduced the subsidy they were entitled to by half, both parties reached an agreement on November 5th.

    京私营聚兴诚商业银行
    劳资纠纷获协议
    【北京讯】私营聚兴诚商业银行北京支行，因停发职工今年的秋节补助费，致引起劳方不满，酿成纠纷。经本市劳动局进行调解说服之后，双方终于在劳资两利、共同维护并发展业务的原则下，相互让步，自行获得协议。双方并于九日将协议书呈请劳动局备案。
    北京聚兴诚商业银行，在解放前，每年年节端午节和中秋节，一向是加发职工等于一个月薪金的补助费，解放后，该行以接获总行的通知为理由，停发职工今年中秋节的补助费，而京津其他同一性质的私营银行业，凡是以前有此制度的，今年仍依旧发给，如开源、建业、大陆、中南、盐业等银行，今年秋节就都发了。劳方根据上述情况，几经向资方商谈交涉，没有结果，经本市第八区工会办事处帮助双方进行协商，该行经理李培之则以“这是上海总行所决定，我不能负责”的理由加以拒绝，因而协商归于失败。上月中旬，第八区工会办事处把此案转请市劳动局办理。该局于受理此案并了解争议的症结之后，即根据两利政策和实际情况，向劳资双方提出调解意见，并希望资方在本市私营银行业集体合同未签订之前，应维持职工旧有的福利设施。经过数度调解说服之后，双方都表示愿意遵照政府的政策，自行协商解决。因劳方照顾资方困难，自动把应得的补助费减为半数，双方才于十一月五日成立协议。
