    CCP Tianjin Municipal Committee Enterprise Party Committee
    Summarizes and Publicizes Party-Building Experience
    (Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 13th) The Enterprise Party Committee of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China recently held an enlarged meeting of party affairs work cadres of its affiliated organs to summarize the party-building work in September and October and convey instructions for branch work in November and December. The meeting pointed out in its summary: The transition from secret party-building to public party-building in September and October is an important change in party-building work; this change is built on the basis of the increased awareness of the masses and the party's public foundation. Prior to this, many party member cadres had serious rural viewpoints, believing that workers were backward and complex, and they dared not develop [the party among them]; on the other hand, workers also had many concerns about joining the party. Since the party in various public enterprises was gradually made public in mid-September, the party's prestige, the awareness of party members, and the masses' understanding of the party have all significantly improved, and the general workers' concerns have been eliminated. Therefore, from mid-September to October 20 alone, more than 1,600 employees publicly applied to join the party. Public party-building generally adopts the method of self-application, mass discussion, branch approval, and approval by the higher party committee. Due to the increase in the party's prestige, the masses are very enthusiastic about being invited to participate in the CCP branch meeting to discuss applicants for party membership. After a worker from the Dongya Tobacco Factory participated in a CCP branch meeting, he actively publicized the benefits of the Communist Party to everyone. More and more people from the North Factory of the Central Electrical Equipment Factory attended branch meetings; some workers would rather not go home at night than attend branch meetings. The opinions expressed by the masses during the discussions are generally correct, and some have raised issues that the branch was not aware of, which greatly helps in the review of party members. The Enterprise Party Committee continued in its summary: Under the correct policy of public party-building, not only party members were educated, but also the masses were educated, so that the masses could supervise the party and help the party to review party members, thereby improving the party's prestige and strengthening the ties between the party and the masses. However, some shortcomings have also occurred in some branches during public party-building. For example, some branches did not absorb the masses when holding branch meetings; some branches advocated that applicants for party membership must be reviewed and discussed by the branch, and those who are deemed acceptable should then be discussed by the masses, while those who are deemed unacceptable would not be discussed by the masses; some branches did not allow applicants to participate when convening branch meetings with mass participation to discuss and approve the admission of applicants; and some branches committed the error of tailism, unconditionally accepting the opinions of the masses. All of these should be corrected.

    中共天津市委企业党委会
    总结公开建党经验
    【新华社天津十三日电】中共天津市委企业党委会，日前召开所属各机关党务工作干部扩大会议，总结九、十两月份建党工作和传达十一、十二两月份支部工作指示。会议在总结中指出：九、十两月份由过去的秘密建党开始走向公开建党，是建党工作的重要转变；这一转变是建筑在群众觉悟的提高和党的公开基础之上的。在此以前，不少党员干部存在着严重的农村观点，认为工人落后和复杂，不敢发展；另一方面，工人对入党问题也有不少顾虑。自从九月中旬各公营企业中的党有步骤地公开后，党的威信、党员的觉悟程度以及群众对党的认识，都有了显著的提高，一般工人的顾虑业已消除。因此，仅九月中旬至十月二十日之间，即有一千六百余职工公开申请入党。公开建党，一般是采取自己申请、群众讨论、支部通过，上级党委批准的方法。由于党的威信的提高，群众对被邀参加中共支部大会讨论申请入党者的情绪很高。东亚烟草厂一个工人参加中共支部大会后，工人即积极向大家宣传共产党的好处。中央电工器材厂北厂参加支部大会的群众越来越多，有的工人晚上宁可不回家，也要参加支部大会。群众在讨论时发表的意见，一般是正确的，有的并提出了支部还不知道的问题，给审查党员以很大帮助。企业党委会在总结中继称：在公开建党的正确方针下，不但教育了党员，也教育了群众，使群众能监督党和帮助党来审查党员，并从而提高了党的威信，密切了党和群众的联系。但在公开建党中有的支部也发生了一些缺点。如有的支部开支部大会时不吸收群众参加；有的支部主张申请入党者须经支部审查讨论后，认为可以吸收者再经群众讨论，不可以吸收者即不经群众讨论；有的召开邀有群众参加的支部大会讨论与通过申请者入党时，不让申请者参加；也有的支部犯了尾巴主义，无条件地接受群众意见。这都是应当纠正的。
