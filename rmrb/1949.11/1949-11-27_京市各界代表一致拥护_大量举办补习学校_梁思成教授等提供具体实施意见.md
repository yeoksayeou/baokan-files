[Beijing News] The resolution of the Second Beijing People's Representative Conference to establish spare-time remedial schools has been unanimously supported by representatives from all walks of life. Fei Xiaotong, a representative of teachers and staff of colleges and universities and a professor at Tsinghua University, said: The establishment of spare-time schools is an extremely important matter at present. This is a concrete plan to improve the cultural and technical level of ordinary citizens, especially workers and cadres. Because the reactionary ruling class deprived most people of the opportunity to receive education for a long time, it has affected the advancement of all construction undertakings. Now that the people are the masters, they must immediately remedy their shortcomings. Therefore, the Beijing People's Representative Conference must do a good job in running spare-time schools. On the one hand, those who run schools must do it seriously; on the other hand, and more importantly, citizens who receive remedial education must earnestly strive for and make good use of this opportunity. We hope to gradually expand it so that all citizens can have the opportunity to enroll. Professor Liang Sicheng of Tsinghua University said: The resolution passed by the People's Representative Conference to prepare for the establishment of spare-time remedial schools is a decision of great significance. A low cultural level is a great obstacle to work efficiency. If a worker has basic training in physics, chemistry, mathematics, he will definitely be able to manage the machine well when managing the machine. I fully support this resolution. However, in terms of implementation technology, careful consideration should be given. We must make use of the existing teachers and equipment of various schools, and we must also make use of the spare time of staff. Professor Li Jinxi of Normal University said: The large-scale establishment of spare-time remedial schools is one of the important resolutions of this conference. "Popularization of education" cannot rely entirely on formal schools at all levels at this stage. We must use spare time to promote this special organization with universality and flexibility, while still being formal education, unified leadership, and teaching in different places. Education at all levels, large, medium, and small, can be completed comprehensively and quickly without affecting everyone's real life and career work. Han Zhuoru, representative of the Beijing Party Affairs Consolidation Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, said: The resolution of this conference to establish spare-time schools to give some cadres and workers with low cultural levels the opportunity to study and improve themselves proves that the people's regime is thinking about the people everywhere. Tang Qingyong, a representative of the business community, said: The resolution on the establishment of spare-time remedial schools is about the cultural improvement of workers and cadres, which is very necessary. The improvement of culture can directly improve work skills and is of great benefit to the production industry. Our business community expresses great agreement. Patriotic democratic representatives Fan Hong, Fei Qing, Wen Jiasi, professors of Peking University, Lu Zhiwei, president of Yanjing University, Wang Biao, representative of the China Democratic National Construction Association, Xiao Song, representative of youth, and Yu Yiyi and Zhu Futang, representatives of medical workers, also unanimously expressed their warm support for the resolution on the establishment of spare-time schools.

　　京市各界代表一致拥护
  　大量举办补习学校
    梁思成教授等提供具体实施意见
    【北京讯】北京市第二届各界人民代表会议决议开办业余补习学校，获得各界代表的一致拥护，院校教职员代表、清华大学教授费孝通说：业余学校的开办是当前极重要的一件事，这是提高一般市民、尤其是工人、干部的文化和技术水平的一个具体方案，因为过去反动派长期统治，大多数人民受教育的机会被剥夺了，影响到一切建设事业的推进，现在人民当了主人，就得立刻来补救自已这一缺点，所以北京市各界人民代表会议要把业余学校搞好，一方面固然办学校者要认真去办；另一方面，更重要的是要受补习教育的市民认真争取和好好利用这个机会，我们更希望能逐渐扩充，使全市市民都能有入学的机会。清华大学教授梁思成说：这次各界人民代表会议通过了筹办业余补习学校的决议，是一个有重大意义的决定。文化水准低，对于工作效率是一个极大的障碍，假使一个工人在理化数学方面有基本训练，他在管理机器时，一定可以管理得好。我对这一决议完全拥护。但在实施的技术方面，应当谨慎考虑，必须利用各学校已有的师资和设备，也必须利用工作人员的业余时间。师范大学校教授黎锦熙说：大规模地开办业余补习学校是这次大会的重要决议之一。“教育大众化”，在现阶段下，不能全靠正规的各级学校，必须利用业余的时间，推广这种有普遍性而又富于弹性，仍不失其为正规教育的特殊组织，统一领导，分地施教，大、中、小各级教育都可以在不影响每个人的现实生活与职业工作的条件下，全面地迅速地完成起来。中国农工民主党北京市党务整理委员会代表韩卓儒说：这次会议决议设立业余学校，给予一部分干部及文化水准低的工人以学习深造的机会，这证明了人民政权是无处不为人民设想的。工商界代表唐庆永说：关于开办业余补习学校决议案，是有关工人和干部的文化提高问题，是十分需要的，文化的提高，直接可以提高工作技能，对生产事业有很大的好处，我们工商界表示非常同意。爱国民主人士代表北大教授樊弘、费青、闻家驷，燕大校长陆志韦，民主建国会代表汪镳，青年代表萧松，医务工作者代表余贻倜、诸福棠等对开办业余学校的决议案也都异口同声地表示热烈拥护。
