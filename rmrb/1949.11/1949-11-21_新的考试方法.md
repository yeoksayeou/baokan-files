　　New Examination Methods
　　Hu Jinquan
    Before liberation, the so-called "examinations" in schools were merely a formality to justify students' "scores" to parents, and some were even used by reactionaries as tools to restrict students' thinking and actions. Now, the purpose of examinations should be to check and summarize students' learning attitude, learning methods, and learning experiences, rather than forcing students to mechanically memorize books and doctrines. Through examinations, students' learning should become more enthusiastic and active. This is fundamentally different in essence.

    However, there is no concrete plan for new examination methods yet, and everyone is exploring in practice. Now, I will introduce the examination methods recently researched by students and teachers of the Beijing Municipal Normal School.

    According to the teaching and research office's regulations, the week before the examination date is designated as the students' "examination preparation week." During this week, on the one hand, teachers can slow down the pace of teaching a little, allowing students to raise questions in class that most students do not understand, which the teacher will then answer; on the other hand, the teacher will extract the key points of the topics covered in this stage and provide students with some concise questions based on the main content of the teaching, so that students can study them in depth.

    Although the teacher provides questions before the exam, the actual exam questions are not exactly the same as those. However, if students can truly and thoroughly understand the spirit of those questions, that is, thoroughly understand the main content of the teaching, they will definitely be able to answer them during the exam.

    After the teacher has given out the questions, students must maximize the effectiveness of their study groups during review, conducting it in a planned, organized, and step-by-step manner.

    During the examination, the student union, the teaching and research office, and the class study representatives should encourage challenges between groups and between classes. After the examination is completed, when evaluating the results, the scores of individuals, groups, and classes should be combined. Not only should individual scores be assessed, but also the scores of study groups and the scores of the class as a whole. Praise the good, encourage the mediocre, in order to improve everyone's learning enthusiasm.

　　新的考试方法
　　胡金泉
    在解放以前，学校中的所谓“考试”，只是为了向家长报销而决定同学“分数”的一种形式，有的甚至被反动派利用作束缚学生思想、行动的工具。而现在，考试的目的，应当是检查总结同学的学习态度，学习方法，学习心得，而不是要使同学死扣书本和背教条。通过考试，使同学们的学习更热烈、更积极。在本质上是根本不同的。
    然而新的考试方法，在目前还没有一个具体的方案，大家都在实际中摸索。现在我把北京市立师范学校新近由同学、教师们共同研究所得的考试方法介绍一下。
    根据教导处规定考试日期的前一周，做为同学们的“考试准备周”，在这一周里，一方面先生在教学进行时，可以稍慢一些，让同学们在课堂上提出大部同学所不了解的问题，由先生来解答；另一方面，由先生把这一阶段所讲的功课，摘出要点，并且根据教学主要内容，扼要地给同学们提出一些问题，让同学深刻学习。
    虽然，考试前先生给出了题，可是考试时的题目，并不就是那里边的题，但是如果同学们真正能够彻底的了解那些问题的精神，也就是彻底了解教学的主要内容，在考试时，一定能够答上来。
    当先生给出完了题后，同学们在温课时，必须要发挥学习小组的最高效能，要有计划、有组织、有步骤地进行温课。
    进行考试时，学生会和教导处及各班的学习委员，要鼓励小组与小组间的挑战，班与班之间的挑战。在考试完毕后，评定成绩时，要把个人和小组与小组间及班与班之间的成绩结合起来，不只是评定个人成绩，而且还要评定学习小组的成绩，评定一班的成绩。好的表扬，次的鼓励，以提高大家的学习情绪。
