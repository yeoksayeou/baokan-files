　　With the increasing exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, native products in Kaifeng City have been selling briskly. Grain stores and fabric shops are experiencing unprecedented business prosperity. Among the eighty-two grain stores in the South Gate, the bulk of wheat and miscellaneous grains procured are for local consumption, with only a small portion being exported. However, due to large-scale purchases of soybeans by merchants from Shanghai and Wuxi, transaction volumes have surged. In October, the total soybean intake reached 10,025.13 *shi* (石, a unit of dry volume), with 9,604.15 *shi* sold, representing increases of 380% and 301% respectively, compared to September. Thirty-nine cotton and fabric shops sold 670,370 *jin* (斤, a unit of weight) of cotton, also a 97.9% increase from September. From November 2nd to 6th, within five days, the transportation industry exported 873 tons of salt, soybeans, cotton, bones, and sesame. Currently, there are 270 tons of goods, including soybeans, bones, and sesame, awaiting loading. Although the Longhai-Jinghan Railway is undergoing comprehensive line maintenance, the railway bureau is prioritizing freight transport during the peak season to strengthen material exchange. From the 3rd to the 13th of this month, the Kaifeng station has been allocated forty 30-ton wagons specifically for public and private freight.

　　In addition to native products, the annual winter peak season for the coal industry has also arrived. The business of the fifteen coal businesses in the South Gate of the city also improved significantly in October. In the whole month, 2,644 tons of fine coal entered the city, and 3,075.93 tons were sold, a significant increase compared to the 1,565.6 tons of fine coal sold in September.
