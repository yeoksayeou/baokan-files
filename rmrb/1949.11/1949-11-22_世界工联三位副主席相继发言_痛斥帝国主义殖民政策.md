　　World Federation of Trade Unions' Three Vice-Presidents Speak in Succession
　　Denouncing Imperialist Colonial Policies
    Also speaking at the meeting today were three vice-presidents of the World Federation of Trade Unions: Subka, Vice-Chairman of the Central Council of Trade Unions of Czechoslovakia; Toridano, President of the Latin American Federation of Labor; and Piña, Secretary-General of the Cuban Confederation of Labor. Subka, representing the working class of the People's Democratic Republic of Czechoslovakia, extended fraternal greetings to all delegates. He said: The victory of the Chinese people represents the source of hope and strength for all oppressed countries. The victory of the Chinese people is the victory of the people of all countries. He guaranteed that the Chinese people would certainly receive active and effective assistance from Czechoslovakia and other people's democratic countries, and embark on the path that the people's democratic countries are already following. Toridano, representing the 6.5 million members of the Latin American Federation of Labor, told the Asian delegates that on the other side of the world, workers in twenty countries will strengthen their struggle against imperialist colonial policies. Piña said that although Cuba is tens of thousands of miles away, it is also suffering from the ravages of colonial policies, and therefore he emphasized that the existence of the international trade union movement is to overthrow the imperialist system, and the convening and achievements of the Asian and Australian Trade Union Conference are a blow to the imperialists.

　　世界工联三位副主席相继发言
　　痛斥帝国主义殖民政策
    今天在会上发言的还有世界工联的三位副主席，即捷克工会中央理事会副主席苏布卡、拉丁美洲工会联合会主席托里达诺和古巴总工会总书记皮尼亚。苏布卡代表人民民主的捷克斯洛伐克共和国工人阶级，向全体代表致兄弟的敬礼。他说：中国人民的胜利，代表了一切被压迫国家的希望和力量的泉源。中国人民的胜利是世界各国人民的胜利。他保证：中国人民一定可以得到捷克和其他各人民民主国家的积极而有效的帮助，走上各人民民主国家已经在行进的道路。托里达诺代表拉丁美洲工会联合会的六百五十万会员，告诉亚洲的代表们：在世界的另一方面，有二十个国家的工人，将要加强斗争，反对帝国主义的殖民政策。皮尼亚说：古巴虽然远在几万英里以外，但也同样遭受着殖民政策的残害，因此他强调说明：国际工会的存在，就是要推翻帝国主义制度，而亚洲、澳洲工会会议的召开和它的成就，就是对帝国主义者的打击。
