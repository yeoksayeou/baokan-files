Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, 18th: A frontline reporter recently commented on the great victory of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army's Third Field Army in annihilating over 100,000 enemy troops and liberating the entire province of Fujian, stating: In the battles of Fuzhou, Zhangzhou, and Xiamen, over 100,000 remnant bandit troops of the Kuomintang were annihilated, and the reactionary and criminal rule of the Kuomintang bandit gang in Fujian for more than 20 years has been overthrown. Except for a small number of remnant bandits trapped on the islands of Kinmen and Dongshan, all 14 million people on the mainland of Fujian have been liberated. By this point, the regular troops of the Kuomintang bandit army on the mainland within our East China region have been completely eliminated.

The reason why the People's Liberation Army was able to complete the arduous task of marching over a thousand *li* in a short period of more than three months and achieve such a great victory is first and foremost due to the correct implementation of the correct strategic policies of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Revolutionary Military Commission, and due to the direct leadership of the East China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Front Committee of the Third Field Army, as well as the coordination of fraternal units. Secondly, fraternal units of the Second Field Army had already entered Fujian in May, directly attacking the Jianyang, Jian'ou, Nanping, and Gutian line, liberating most of northern Fujian, and paving the way for our army to penetrate deep into central and southern Fujian to annihilate large numbers of remnant bandits. Moreover, the enthusiastic support and assistance of the broad masses of the people of Fujian and the people's guerrillas were important factors in our army's victory. The people of Fujian have long suffered from the long-term oppression of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, enduring deep suffering and eagerly awaiting liberation. Moreover, they have been tempered by revolution for a long time and have a glorious revolutionary tradition, with revolutionary struggles never ceasing for twenty years. Therefore, as soon as our army arrived, they boiled water, delivered food, provided grain and grass, and organized transportation teams, stretcher teams, and boatmen teams to lead the way and deliver messages, enthusiastically supporting the War of Liberation. Not only workers and peasants actively participated, but young students also voluntarily participated in supporting the front lines. Others, such as coastal fishermen, boat owners, and returned overseas Chinese, also played a significant role in supporting the War of Liberation. The people's guerrillas led by the local Communist Party of Fujian, who have persisted in struggle for more than ten years, have made great achievements in combat and supporting the front lines. For example, in the Battle of Pingtan, the guerrillas on the island swam ashore to report on the situation of the remnant bandits and guided the People's Liberation Army for the cross-sea attack.

The arduous struggle and heroic fighting of the People's Liberation Army are the direct and great factors in achieving victory. They braved the scorching heat, climbed mountains and crossed rivers, endured hunger and thirst, camped in the mountains and fields, fought against typhoons and waves, endured many hardships, and overcame various difficulties. In order to pursue and annihilate fleeing enemies, they often marched more than a hundred *li* in a single day and night. In cross-sea operations, they not only conquered the waves but also swept away various strong fortifications of the enemy. Barbed wire, wooden stakes, electric nets, mines, and reinforced concrete pillboxes could not stop the victorious advance of the People's Liberation Army. Many combatants and commanders of the People's Liberation Army continued to fight without leaving the front line after being wounded. Some used stones and gun butts to fight the bandits after running out of bullets, highly demonstrating the noble qualities of the people's army fighting heroically for the people, unafraid of bloodshed and sacrifice.

The victories in the battles of Fuzhou, Zhangzhou, and Xiamen prove that the People's Liberation Army is fully capable of annihilating the enemy at sea. Our army has gained rich experience in cross-sea operations in actual combat. Any struggle and resistance by the Kuomintang bandit army at sea will be ineffective, and the fate of complete annihilation of the remnant bandit troops of the Kuomintang bandit gang is inevitable. However, we must never be proud, underestimate the enemy, be impatient, rash, or careless because of this. Because before its demise, the Kuomintang bandit gang will surely step up its frantic struggle, attempting to prolong its life and make a comeback. We must constantly improve our combat effectiveness, strengthen combat readiness, and, according to Chairman Mao's instructions, treat a weak enemy as a strong enemy in order to continue to develop and consolidate victory on the basis of the great victories in the battles of Fuzhou, Zhangzhou, and Xiamen, liberate the unliberated islands along the coast of Fujian, so as to cooperate with fraternal units to liberate Taiwan and liberate all of China.

　　前线记者评解放福建伟大胜利
  　我获丰富渡海作战经验         
    残匪难逃全部被歼命运
    【新华社福建前线十八日电】前线记者顷就人民解放军第三野战军某部歼敌十万余人，解放福建全省的伟大胜利发表评论称：福州、漳厦两役国民党残余匪军被歼十万以上，国民党匪帮在福建二十余年的反动罪恶统治已被推翻，除金门、东山两岛尚有少数残匪困守外，福建大陆上一千四百万人民已全部获得解放。至此，我华东地区内部大陆上国民党匪军的正规部队业已完全肃清。
    人民解放军所以能够在三个多月的短促时间内，完成艰苦的千余里进军任务，获得如此伟大的胜利，首先是由于正确执行了中共中央和人民革命军事委员会的正确战略方针，是由于中共中央华东局和三野前委的直接领导和各兄弟部队的配合。其次，第二野战军兄弟部队早在五月间即已进入福建，直捣建阳、建瓯、南屏、古田一线，解放了闽北大部地区，替我军深入闽中、闽南大量歼灭残匪开辟了胜利道路。而福建广大人民与人民游击队的热烈支援与协助，尤为我军获得胜利的重要因素。福建人民久受帝国主义和国民党反动派的长期压迫，痛苦深重，急盼解放，而且他们久经革命锻炼，具有光荣的革命传统，二十年来革命斗争从未中断。因此，我军一到，他们便烧水送饭，出粮出草，组织运输队、担架队、船工队、带路、送信，热烈地支援解放战争。不仅工人农民积极参加，青年学生也自动参加支援前线，其他如沿海渔民、船户、归国华侨等，在支援解放战争中也起了很大作用。坚持斗争十余年的中共福建地方党所领导的人民游击队，在战斗和支援前线工作中，更有极大成绩。如平潭战斗中，岛上的游击队曾泅海上岸，报告残匪情况，并为渡海攻击的解放军领航。
    人民解放军的艰苦奋斗，英勇善战，是取得胜利的直接的伟大因素。他们冒着酷暑，爬山过水，忍饥耐渴，露营山野，与台风海浪搏斗，忍受了许多困苦，克服了种种艰难。为追歼逃敌，他们一昼夜间行军常在百里以上。在渡海作战中，他们即战胜了波浪，又扫除了敌人的各种强固的工事设备。铁丝网、木椽、电网、水雷、钢骨水泥地土堡都阻挡不住人民解放军的胜利进攻。解放军许多战斗员指挥员负伤不下火线，继续战斗，有的在子弹打完之后用石块和枪托与匪博斗，高度地发扬了人民军队为人民英勇战斗，不怕流血牺牲的高贵品质。
    福州、漳厦两役的胜利，证明人民解放军完全有力量在海上歼灭敌人。我军在实战中已获得了丰富的渡海作战经验。国民党匪军在海上的任何挣扎抵抗都将是无效的，国民党匪帮残余匪军全部被歼的命运绝难幸免。但我们绝不可因此而骄傲轻敌、急躁轻率、粗心大意。因为国民党匪帮在灭亡以前，必将更加疯狂进行挣扎，妄图苟延残喘，死灰复然。我们必须不断提高战斗力，加强战斗准备，按照毛主席的指示，把弱敌当成强敌打，才能在福州、漳厦两役的伟大胜利的基础上，继续发展并巩固胜利，解放福建沿海尚未解放的岛屿，以便配合兄弟部队解放台湾、解放全中国。
