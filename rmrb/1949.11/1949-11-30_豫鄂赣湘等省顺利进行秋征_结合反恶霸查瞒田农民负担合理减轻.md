Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 28th—Autumn grain collection work is proceeding smoothly in Central China. Henan and Hubei provinces, as well as parts of Hunan, have entered the grain delivery phase, and Jiangxi completed preparatory work by mid-month. Hubei began deploying autumn grain collection in mid-September, combining it with bandit suppression, opposition to local tyrants, and production for disaster relief. Grain delivery began in early October and is expected to be largely completed by the end of this month. In Henan Province, grain collection work was deployed to the villages in early this month. After extensive and in-depth publicity and mobilization, it has now entered the grain delivery phase. Jiangxi began various preparations in September. In order to create experience, each county selected key areas to test grain collection. Now a full-scale collection is about to begin and is expected to be completed by the end of December. In October, Hunan focused on Changsha, Changde, and Yiyang prefectures as key areas for grain collection. Now most areas of these three prefectures have begun delivering grain.

In the autumn grain collection work, all localities attach importance to using farmer representative meetings or people's representative meetings at all levels to promote the work. For example, explaining the victorious situation and reasonable burden policy through meetings, understanding the situation, democratically evaluating and distributing tasks, and discussing specific methods for implementing policies. Hunan, Hubei and other places also control and supervise the old Bao-Jia heads through farmer representatives, so that they can redeem themselves by performing meritorious service in the grain collection work. At the beginning of the autumn grain collection work, all localities used the method of accounting in detail, which was in stark contrast to the Kuomintang rule in the past to dispel the idea of some cadres that the burden was heavy. In the grain collection work, it is combined with the opposition to local tyrants to mobilize the masses to investigate the concealment of land and the landlords' arrears of public grain and the shifting of the burden to hired and poor middle peasants, thereby reducing the burden on farmers. In terms of investigating concealed land, in many villages in Huangchuan, Shangqiu, Chenliu, and Luoyang prefectures in Henan, for example, the burden on farmers was reduced by 15% to 20% because a large amount of illegally possessed land was seized. Local experiences have proved that in areas where illegally possessed land has been seized, the burden on farmers has been greatly reduced, and their enthusiasm has been greatly increased, and the confidence of cadres has been greatly enhanced. In the autumn grain collection work, the leading organs at all levels in all localities pay attention to timely inspection of the implementation of the reasonable burden policy, and correct the biases of some cadres, such as the simple task viewpoint, impetuousness, commandism, paralysis, and complacency. In the autumn grain collection, some areas in Hubei and Hunan have found the bias of simply relying on Bao-Jia heads without mobilizing the masses to supervise them, resulting in many malpractices, which have been corrected in time. All localities have strengthened the work of suppressing bandits and preventing special agents in the autumn grain collection, so as to prevent local tyrants, landlords, bandits and special agents from taking the opportunity to sabotage and disrupt. For example, Luoyang and other counties in Henan generally organized joint defense. Pingjiang, Hunan, exposed the conspiracy of bad elements such as local tyrants and landlords to secretly organize "ten-man groups" to sabotage grain collection.

Due to the correct implementation of the reasonable burden policy, the victory of the struggle to suppress bandits and oppose local tyrants, and the development of the national victory situation, the farmers in various places are extremely enthusiastic in delivering grain. In many areas of Henan, farmers are building sheds in the rain to rush to thresh public grain. In order to ensure that public grain is stored in a timely manner, farmers in many places have organized grain delivery teams to help each other collectively to deliver grain. At the same time, the leading organs in various localities attach importance to the storage and transportation of grain. In mid-month, the Hunan Provincial People's Government issued the "Measures for the Delivery, Transportation and Storage of Public Grain," instructing all localities to strictly inspect when receiving public grain, and to establish an agency for managing public grain. All warehouses in various localities must be regularly inspected, turned over and dried to avoid losses. All cities and villages on the transportation lines in Jiangxi Province have renovated more than 450 large and small grain warehouses, solving the problem of storing public grain throughout the province this year.

　　鄂赣湘等省顺利进行秋征
    结合反恶霸查瞒田农民负担合理减轻
    【新华社汉口二十八日电】华中各地秋征工作正顺利进行中。河南、湖北两省和湖南部分地区已进入缴粮阶段，江西亦于本月中旬完成准备工作。湖北在九月中旬即普遍结合剿匪反恶霸和生产救灾工作布置秋征，十月初旬开始缴粮，预计本月底征粮工作可大部完成。河南省的征粮工作已于本月上旬布置到村，经过广泛深入的宣传动员，现已进入缴粮阶段。江西自九月起便开始了各项准备工作。各县为了创造经验，都选择重点试验征粮。现在即将开始全面征收，预计十二月底可全部完成任务。湖南十月份以长沙、常德、益阳三个专区为征粮重点区。现在这三个专区的大部地区已开始缴粮。
    在秋征工作中，各地均重视运用农民代表会议或各界人民代表会议来推动工作。如通过会议讲解胜利形势和合理负担政策，了解情况，民主评议分配任务，讨论执行政策的具体办法等。湖南、湖北等地并通过农民代表来控制和监督旧保甲长，让他们在征粮工作中立功自赎。秋征工作开始时，各地均用了比过去国民党统治时期和算细帐的方法打破了某些干部盲目认为负担重的思想。在征粮工作中，并结合反恶霸，发动群众进行查瞒田反地主拖欠公粮和转嫁负担于雇贫中农等斗争，从而减轻了农民负担。在查瞒田方面，如河南潢川、商邱、陈留、洛阳等专区不少村庄，因挤出大量黑地，使农民负担减轻了百分十五到二十。各地经验证明，在黑田挤出后的地区，农民的负担即大为减轻，情绪因而大为高涨，干部的信心亦因此大大增强。各地各级领导机关在秋征工作中，都注意及时检查合理负担政策的执行情况，纠正某些干部的单纯任务观点、急躁图省事、强迫命令、麻痹自满等偏向。湖北、湖南的个别地区在秋征中曾发现单纯依靠保甲长的偏向，没有发动群众去监督他们，以致发生许多弊病，已予及时纠正。各地在秋征中均同时加强剿匪防特的工作，防止恶霸地主、土匪特务乘隙破坏捣乱。如河南洛阳等县普遍组织了联防。湖南平江揭露了恶霸地主等坏分子秘密组织“十人团”破坏征粮的阴谋。
    由于合理负担政策的正确执行，剿匪反恶霸斗争的胜利，加以全国胜利形势的发展，各地农民在交粮中情绪极高。河南不少地区的农民都在雨天搭着棚子赶碾公粮。为了保证公粮及时入仓，许多地方的农民组织了送粮队，集体互助送粮。同时各地领导机关均重视粮食的保管运输工作。湖南省临时人民政府于本月中旬发布了“公粮缴运保管办法”，指示各地接收公粮时必须严格检查，并应建立管理公粮的机构，各地仓库必须定期检查，勤翻勤晒，免遭损失。江西省各地在交通线上的各城市乡村已经整修了大小粮食仓库四百五十余处，解决了今年全省公粮的存放问题。
