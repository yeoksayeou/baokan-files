    After initially learning Soviet scientific management methods, public factories in the Lüda area have generally improved production efficiency. The output of eighteen major factories in the first half of this year exceeded the plan by an average of 22 percent. The Sino-Soviet Far East Electric Power Company Glass Factory, which was awarded the title of "Model Factory," completed its annual plan in the first half of this year. Compared with the total output in 1943 under Japanese rule, the output in the first half of this year exceeded the latter by 63 percent. On September 15th, the factory began dismantling and repairing the glass melting furnace, completing the 40-day kiln repair plan in 14 days (it took 70 days under Japanese rule), which may enable this year's output to exceed that of 1943 by 200 percent.
    The glass factory's achievements have benefited from objective advantages. The victory of the Liberation War opened up coal resources in Fushun, which greatly improved the quality of the main fuel – gas. In addition, the manufacturing of glass sheets is a single production process, which is easier to plan production precisely, improve labor skills, and strengthen labor organization compared to factories that manufacture multiple products simultaneously. Glass workers, as specialized personnel, find it difficult to find suitable jobs outside of this factory. As a result, the backbone workers did not scatter in large numbers during difficult times. Each major technical department retains 20 to 32 percent of veteran technical workers. All of these are favorable conditions. However, the chaos and difficulties of the initial period of recovery tell us that without the high degree of production enthusiasm and creativity of all employees, without trusting their creative abilities, and especially without the guidance of Soviet scientific production management experience to ensure that this enthusiasm and creativity are brought into play, and without humbly learning from these advanced experiences, it would be impossible to run the factory well, no matter how many objective advantages there may be.
    　　　　Chaotic Initial Recovery Period
    The Far East Electric Power Company Glass Factory was originally the Japanese "Changguang Glass Co., Ltd." It was established 25 years ago and has more than 1,300 employees. Those who have worked in the factory for five years are not considered old workers. During liberation, employees bravely protected the factory against destruction by the Japanese invaders, and the machinery and equipment were preserved intact. However, in the past, the main technical departments were all controlled by the Japanese, and the instruction drawings of various equipment were hidden and destroyed by them. Therefore, in the second half of 1947, the recovery of production faced great difficulties in technical leadership.
    At that time, the Lüda area was under the naval and land blockade of the reactionaries, and the source of raw materials and the sales of products became serious obstacles to the resumption of production. Therefore, "saving food and clothing and restoring production" was the only correct guideline at that time to lead the workers to overcome difficulties. However, the deputy director, who had just transferred from the countryside to the city, one-sidedly emphasized that "production enthusiasm cannot be mobilized without improving living conditions." He spent all day investigating prices, counting the population of workers' families, calculating wage purchasing power, and making lists to argue with the factory director, while allowing the factory to fall into a state of chaos without labor discipline. Fifteen workers in one workshop were simultaneously absent from work without anyone intervening. Workers could randomly switch to any machine to work on, and the workshop foreman could be completely unaware of the machine idling for half a day. Glass was arbitrarily damaged, and theft was rampant in all production departments. The trade union also blindly sided with and tolerated these serious phenomena, which not only fueled the backward sentiments of the new workers but also made the old technicians, who had always regarded the factory as their backer, generally pessimistic and passive, causing the trade union itself to become completely detached from the masses. "Welfare, welfare, doesn't fill the stomach," was the workers' comment on the trade union's work. Trade union member meetings often only had three or five people, and as soon as the chairman turned around, these few people disappeared. At the end of the year, the summary of production did not even reach one-tenth of the annual output during Japanese rule. Later, a furnace leakage incident occurred, and even that pitiful production was interrupted. The factory's crisis reached its peak.
    　　　　The Key to Unity between the Trade Union and the Administration
    It was unimaginable to maintain production without changing this chaotic situation. In February 1948, the Chinese manager of the Far East Electric Power Company and the Party Committee of the enterprise reappointed the deputy director, the Party branch secretary, and the trade union cadres of the glass factory. They immediately started two major tasks: relying on the Chinese old technicians who had contributed to protecting the factory to establish labor organizations and reform the trade union. On the one hand, the administration boldly promoted them to leadership positions in various workshops. On the other hand, they mobilized the workers to elect the old technicians they respected to serve as the trade union chairman. At that time, the biggest concern of the Chinese leaders of the factory was: Could workers who did not understand comprehensive technology lead production? Even the workers themselves, such as Liu Maoyou, who had worked on the melting furnace for 25 years, lacked confidence and feared that the burden of being the melting department chief was "too heavy to bear." However, one thing was certain: The old technicians who regarded the factory as their lifelong livelihood would not do worse than the imperialist technicians who deliberately sabotaged, even if they didn't do well. After they took on production management jobs such as department chiefs, section chiefs, team leaders, and technicians, they immediately divided the workshop workers into work teams and groups fixed to machines; implemented the production daily report system prescribed by the Soviet factory director, which had been shelved; and announced the labor discipline jointly drafted by the staff union and the administration. Although these activists were still being hit and excluded by the backward sentiment that still dominated the workers at the time, the output in March increased, but the chaotic phenomena such as arbitrarily breaking glass and casually arriving late and leaving early were finally stopped, and order began to be established in the factory.
    However, the Chinese cadres who had worked in rural areas and war environments for a long time were still incompatible with the modern production methods of enterprises. Chinese cadres were accustomed to completing tasks at all costs during the war, but the Soviet factory director wanted to hold meetings and calculate production costs. Chinese cadres were accustomed to seasonal production rushes in rural areas that did not miss the farming season, but the Soviet factory director required maintaining continuous labor during normal eight-hour workdays. Chinese cadres also knew that the mass work in the factory was for the development of production, but not allowing meetings during work hours was like making it impossible to carry out political education. -- Individual conversations, political lessons, training classes, mobilization meetings, cultivating activists, developing worker Party members, electing meritorious models... In short, mobilizing the masses meant occupying work time. It was not until April, when the factory had no money to pay wages during the furnace repair period, that the production concept of the Party and trade union leaders was clearly established.
    During the two months of the kiln repair period, glass production was completely stopped, but wages and factory expenses had to be paid as usual. When the vault was opened, there were only a few thousand yuan in cash; when money was withdrawn from the bank, the deposit was gone. After carefully calculating the income since the start of operations, it was realized that the money earned in the past few months was not enough to compensate for two months. The Soviet factory director said: "The factory can only earn money for the country; if it does not produce several million square meters of glass a year, not only will the state-owned factory be bankrupted by us, but the workers' jobs will also be smashed sooner or later."
    The Party and trade union leaders realized the seriousness of the matter at this time. The primary task at hand was how to shorten the kiln repair period of non-glass production. Therefore, the Party and the trade union issued an emergency call to the workers: "Guarantee the completion of the kiln repair in sixty days!" At the same time, they mobilized the responsible cadres of various workshops to personally take the lead and form a shock team of more than 400 people with them as the core, becoming the backbone organization for dismantling and repairing the melting furnace. This was an unprecedentedly powerful kiln repair force since the establishment of the factory. Through the efforts of all employees, it was finally completed 53 days ahead of schedule. The factory carefully calculated the cost, and the kiln repair expenses were reduced by three-quarters. The Soviet factory director immediately requested the Electric Power Company to award bonuses to more than 300 people who had contributed to the kiln repair. The workers' morale was greatly boosted, and the glass output in August exceeded the plan by 42 percent at once. The factory director then, based on the suggestion of the trade union, universally raised the wage levels of all workers by one grade, and the allocation of low-priced grain and cloth was also increased. As labor hero Liu Maoyou said: "In the past, no matter how much we held meetings, made requests, or made trouble, we could not get enough to eat. But when the glass comes out, we have everything." The Party and the trade union seized the opportunity of high production to conduct education on the idea of being the masters of the country, launched three production emulation campaigns to celebrate "May Day," "July 1st," and the October Revolution Day, and at the same time, in coordination with the administration, systematically organized workers to learn technology in batches, so that the production efficiency of each worker was increased by an average of 36 percent, and the annual output exceeded the plan by 30 percent. Wage income also increased by an average of 24 percent. Workers began to realize from their personal experience that the interests of the factory were also their own personal interests, and production enthusiasm was generally improved. The activists who were ridiculed and attacked in the past have now become the most respected figures, and the work steps of the Party branch, the administration, and the staff union have also become consistent under the clear production goals.
    　　　　The Plan – “A Common Law”
    In 1949, the Far East Electric Power Company assigned the glass factory a production task of 2.75 million square meters of glass.
    This number is 136 percent of last year's plan, and 100,000 square meters more than last year's actual output. Compared with the output during the Japanese occupation, it has reached a height of 162 percent.
    This plan was determined based on the precise calculations and analysis of the chief engineer and experts. However, experts can precisely calculate the potential capacity of machines, but they cannot calculate the emotions of the workers. As early as the chaotic period at the end of 1947, although the production emotions of the workers were generally low, the production rate per hour of each glass sheet manufacturing machine had reached 121 percent of the Japanese rule period, because the workers had been liberated from their slave status. With the rapid improvement of class consciousness, the production rate of each plate-making machine had jumped to 187 percent by October last year. At the same time, workers, especially old technical workers who have been promoted to technical leadership positions, have successively put forward many rationalization proposals for improving production organization and machinery and equipment. After the chief engineer and technicians studied, reviewed, and summarized the results, they believed that as many as twelve suggestions were of great value for improving production. If all of them are realized, the planned output for this year can be increased by at least 30 percent. Therefore, the administration, the Party, and the trade union of the factory jointly formulated a "hope plan" of 3.6 million square meters as a goal for the entire factory to strive to break through the existing production level. The Soviet factory director often said: "Every factory should have a clear plan; how much to reduce production costs this year, and how much to improve workers' lives." Taking the production plan of the Far East Electric Power Company as the standard for production quotas, and the "hope plan" as the common guideline for the factory to implement a progressive piece-rate wage system to encourage technological advancement, as well as for the trade union to lead workers to launch production emulation campaigns – once these two plans were discussed by all employees, they naturally became a production "law" commonly observed by the administration, the Party, and the trade union. A series of tasks were simultaneously launched around the central link of breaking through the existing production level. (To be continued)

　　大连模范工厂
  　中苏远东电业公司玻璃工厂
    华山
    旅大地区各公营工厂，在初步地学会了苏联的科学管理方法以后，生产效率普遍提高，十八个主要工厂今年上半年的产量平均超过计划百分之二十二。其中被奖为“模范工厂”的中苏远东电业公司玻璃工厂，今年上半年已完成了全年的计划，这半年的产量和日寇统治时代一九四三年全年产量相比，则超过后者百分之六十三。九月十五日该厂开始拆修熔化玻璃的大窑，又以十四天完成了四十天的修窑计划（日寇统治时代为七十天），因而使得今年产量可能超过一九四三年百分之二百。
    玻璃工厂之所以获得这种成绩，有其客观的有利条件。解放战争的胜利打开了抚顺的煤源，这就大大提高了主要燃料——煤气的质量。此外，玻璃板的制造是一种单一性质的生产过程，比起同时制造多种产品的工厂更便于精确地计划生产，便于提高劳动熟练程度和加强劳动组织；玻璃工人这种专门人材，离开本厂就不易找到适当职业，因而骨干工人没有在困难时期大批流散，各个主要技术部门都保有百分之二十到三十二的老技术工人；这些都是有利的条件。可是恢复生产初期的混乱和困难却告诉我们，如果没有全体职工的生产积极性和创造力的高度发扬，如果不信任他们的创造能力，特别是如果没有苏联的科学的生产管理经验的指导，保证这些积极性和创造力发挥出来，如果不虚心学习这些先进的经验，那么客观有利条件再多也是不可能把工厂办好的。
    　　　　混乱的恢复初期
    远东电业公司玻璃工厂原为日寇的“昌光硝子株式会社”，建厂已二十五年，拥有职工一千三百多名，在本厂工作五年的还算不了老工人。解放时职工们反对日寇破坏，英勇护厂，机器设备得保完整。可是，过去主要技术部门全掌握在日本人手中，各种设备的说明图又被他们藏匿消毁，因此一九四七年下半年恢复生产时，在技术领导上发生了很大困难。
    当时旅大地区正处在反动派的海陆封锁中，原料来源和产品销路成了复工生产的严重障碍。因此，“节衣缩食，恢复生产”，是当时领导工人战胜困难的唯一正确方针。但是初从农村转入城市的副厂长，却片面强调“不改善生活就无法发动生产热情”，整天忙于调查物价，统计工人家属人口，计算工资购买能力，列具清单去和厂长争执，而听任工厂陷于毫无劳动纪律的混乱状态。一个车间里十五个工人同时不上班无人过间；工人可以随便转到任何一架机器上去工作，机器空转半天车间工长可以毫无所知；玻璃被任意损坏，偷窃现象遍于各个生产部门。对于这些严重现象，工会也一味偏袒姑息，不但助长了新工人的落后情绪，而且使从来把工厂当成靠山的老技工也普遍消极悲观起来，致使工会自身完全和群众脱离。“福利福利，不当饭吃”，这就是工人们对工会工作的评语。工会会员大会经常只有三五个群众，主席一转身这几个人也不见了。年底总结生产，还达不到日寇统治时年产量的十分之一。后来发生漏窑事件，就连这点可怜的生产也中断了。工厂的危机达到顶点。
    　　　　工会与行政团结的关键
    不改变这种混乱的局面，要维持生产是难以想象的。一九四八年二月，远东电业公司的中国经理和中共企业党委会重新配备了玻璃工厂的副厂长、党的总支书记和工会干部。他们立即着手两大工作：依靠护厂有功的中国老技工建立劳动组织和改造工会，一方面由行政上把他们大胆提拔到各车间的领导岗位上，一方面发动工人选举他们敬重的老技工担任工会主席。当时该厂的中国领导人员最大的顾虑是：不懂全面技术的工人能否领导生产？工人自己如象在熔化大窑上做了二十五年工的刘茂有也没有信心，害怕熔化部长这重担“挑不起来”。不过有一点是可以确定的：把工厂当成一辈子靠山的老技工，做不好也不会比蓄意破坏的帝国主义技术者做得更坏。他们担任了部长、股长、班长、技手等生产管理工作后，立刻把车间工人分别编成固定于机器上的工作班和小组；实行被搁置了的苏联厂长所规定的生产日报制度；宣布职工会和行政共同拟定的劳动纪律。尽管这些积极分子当时到处受到在工人中还占压倒优势的落后情绪的打击排斥，还不可成把三月份的产量提高，但是任意摔碎玻璃和随便迟到早退等混乱现象总算停止了，工厂秩序开始建立起来。
    但是曾长期在农村和战争环境中工作的中国干部，对企业化的现代生产方式还是格格不入的。中国干部在战争中习惯了不顾一切代价去完成任务，苏联厂长却要开会，计算生产成本；中国干部在农村中习惯了不误农时的季节性生产突击，苏联厂长却要求在八小时的正常工作中保持持续的劳动。中国干部也知道工厂的群众工作是为了发展生产，但是不让在工作时间开会就好象无法进行政治教育。——个别谈话，上政治课，办训练班，开动员大会，培养积极分子，发展工人党员，选举功臣模范……一句话，要发动群众就得侵占工作时间。直到四月间拆修大窑工厂无钱支付工资的时候，党和工会的领导者的生产观念才明确建立起来。
    修窑期的两个月间，玻璃生产完全停止了，但是工资和工厂费用却得照常支付。打开金库一看，现款只有几千元；向银行提款，存款光了。仔细核算开工以来的收入，才知道过去几个月挣下的钱还不够赔两个月。苏联厂长说：“工厂只能替国家挣钱；一年不生产几百万平方米玻璃，不但国家的工厂要叫我们赔垮，就是工人的饭碗，迟早也要被砸碎的。”
    党和工会的领导者这时才感到事情严重了。眼前的首要任务，就是如何缩短非玻璃生产的修窑期。于是党和工会向工人发出紧急号召：“保证六十天修好大窑！”同时动员各车间的负责干部亲自带头，以他们为核心组成四百多人的突击队，成为拆修熔化大窑的骨干组织。这是建厂以来从未有过的强大修窑力量，经过全体职工的努力，终于以五十三天提前竣工了。厂方仔细核算成本，修窑经费竟然节省了四分之三。苏联厂长立即呈请电业公司，给修窑有功的三百多人颁发奖金。工人情绪大为振奋，八月间的玻璃产量一下子超过了计划百分之四十二。厂长于是又根据工会建议，把全厂工人的工资等级普遍提高一级，低价粮食和布匹等的配给量也增加了。正如劳动英雄刘茂有说的：“从前开会呀，请求呀，再闹也吃不饱饭。可是玻璃一出什么都有了。”党和工会抓紧生产高涨的时机，进行国家主人翁思想教育，展开了迎接“五一”、“七一”和十月革命节的三次生产竞赛的立功运动，同时配合行政有计划地分批组织工人学习技术，使得每个工人的生产效率平均提高了百分之三十六，全年产量超过计划百分之三十。工资收入也平均提高了百分之二十四。工人们开始从切身经验中体会到工厂的利益也就是自己个人的利益，生产热情普遍提高；原来遭受讽刺打击的积极分子现在成了最受尊敬的人物，党的支部、行政和职工会的工作步调也在明确的生产目标下趋于一致了。
    　　　　计划——“共同的法律”
    一九四九年，远东电业公司给玻璃工厂的生产任务是二百七十五万平方米玻璃。
    这个数字为去年计划百分之一三六，比去年的实际产量还多十万平方米。如果和日寇统治时代的产量比较，则已达到百分之一六二的高度。
    这个计划是根据总工程师和专家的精确计算和分析而定出来的。但是，专家可以精确计算机器的潜在能力，却无法计算出工人的情绪。早在一九四七年底的混乱时期中，尽管工人的生产情绪普遍低落，但是每台玻璃板制造机每小时的生产率已经达到日寇统治时代的百分之一二一，因为工人已经从奴隶地位解放出来了。随着阶级觉悟的迅速提高，每台制板机的生产率到去年十月份已一跃而为百分之一八七。同时，工人们特别是提拔到技术领导岗位上的老技术工人，先后提出了许多改进生产组织和机器设备的合理化建议。经过总工程师和技师们研究审核、集中归纳的结果，认为对改进生产极有价值的建议竟达十二项之多。如果全部实现，最少可以把今年的计划产量再提高百分之三十以上。于是工厂的行政、党、工会三方面，又共同订出一个三百六十万平方米的希望计划，作为全厂突破现有生产水平的奋斗目标。苏联厂长常说：“每个工厂都应该有明确的计划；今年预备降低生产成本多少，改善工人生活多少。”以远东电业公司的生产计划作为生产定额的标准，以“希望计划”作为厂方实施鼓励技术上进的超额累进奖薪制，以及工会领导工人展开生产立功竞赛的共同准绳，——这两个计划一经全体职工讨论之后，便自然成为行政、党和工会共同遵守的生产“法律”。一系列的工作都围绕着突破现有生产水平这个中心环节同时展开。　　　　（未完）
