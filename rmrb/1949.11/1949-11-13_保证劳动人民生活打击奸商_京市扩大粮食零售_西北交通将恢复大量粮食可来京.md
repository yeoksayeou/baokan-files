    【Beijing News】In order to combat profiteers and guarantee the livelihood of the working people, the Beijing Municipal People's Government has decided to universally establish grain retail stores throughout the city. This will enable the grain company to directly supply citizens, reducing exploitation by merchants in the middle. In addition to the original grain company business locations (12 locations) and retail stores (24 locations), cooperatives in each district (25 locations) will also handle retail matters for non-members. The retail target is mainly the working people and impoverished people. The amount of grain purchased is calculated at one jin (approximately 500 grams or 1.1 pounds) per person per day (regardless of coarse or fine grains), purchased once every five days. It has now been decided to begin retail sales on the 14th of this month. The addresses of the cooperatives in each district are: First District Cooperative: 10 Tiejiaoying, Zhugan Xiang. Third District Cooperative: 31 Weijia Hutong, Houmen of Beixinqiao Santiao, 12 Bao'en Temple, Beixinqiao. Sixth District Cooperative: 1 Xicha, Xiyinsi, 5 East Jing Mountain Street. Seventh District Cooperative: 19 Rongxian Hutong. Eighth District Cooperative: Jiajia Garden, Xinkai Road. Ninth District Cooperative: West Liulichang, South Xinhua Street. Tenth District Cooperative: Tieluluba Hutong, Chongwai. Eleventh District Cooperative: Baiyi Alley, Laoqianggen, Xuanwai. Twelfth District Cooperative: Yongdingmen Main Street, Taiping Bridge. Garment Factory Cooperative: South Xiaojie, Chaoyangmen Nei. People's Printing Factory Cooperative: Chongxiaosi, Eleventh District. Fifth District Cooperative: 53 Guozishi Street, 17 Yandaixie Street, Niangniang Temple, Jiugulou Street, Juer Hutong, Luoguxiang.
    【Beijing News】Following the containment of the plague in Chahar Province, according to yesterday's (12th) news, transportation in the Northwest will resume within days. Large quantities of grain ordered by Beijing grain merchants in the Northwest will steadily arrive in Beijing.
