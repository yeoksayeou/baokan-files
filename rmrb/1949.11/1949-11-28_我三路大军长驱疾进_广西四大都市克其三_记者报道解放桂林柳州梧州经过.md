　　Our Three Armies Advance Rapidly
  　Three of Guangxi's Four Major Cities Captured
    Reporter Reports on the Liberation of Guilin, Liuzhou, and Wuzhou
    [Xinhua News Agency, South China Front, 27th] A front-line reporter reports on the People's Liberation Army's Fourth Field Army's advance into Guangxi and the liberation of Guilin, Liuzhou, and Wuzhou, stating: The People's Liberation Army's Fourth Field Army, carrying out Commander-in-Chief Zhu's order to liberate Guangxi and annihilate the remnants of the Chiang-Gui bandits, launched a powerful offensive from the southern Hunan front in three routes starting on the 7th of this month. As of the 25th, after nineteen days of continuous marching and combat, overcoming various difficulties caused by the White bandits' sabotage of transportation, 18 county towns have been liberated. Of Guangxi Province's four major cities—Guilin, Liuzhou, Wuzhou, and Nanning—all except Nanning have been liberated.
    In this advance, our Western Route Army crossed the Hunan-Guizhou-Guangxi border, following the old path of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army's Seventh Army northward in 1930, and passing through muddy mountain areas. It first completely eliminated the remaining bandits and puppet forces in the Hunan-Guizhou border area, and then stationed in Jingxian and Tongdao (liberated again). On the 13th and 14th, our army liberated the three cities of Liping, Rongjiang, and Congjiang in southeastern Guizhou, and then marched rapidly, breaking into northern Guangxi. From the 19th to the 24th, in six days, it successively captured the cities of Sanjiang, Yibei, Rongxian, Luocheng, and Sien. At 11:00 AM on the 25th, it captured Liuzhou City, the intersection of the Xiang-Gui and Qian-Gui railways. The Eastern Route Army crossed the Xiaoshui River from Lingling, disregarding the fatigue of day and night marching, and went straight to eastern Guangxi. From the 19th to the 25th, our army successively liberated the cities of Fuchuan, Zhongshan, Xindu, Hexian, and Yangshuo. At 6:00 PM on the 25th, it captured Wuzhou City, an important town in eastern Guangxi. When our Western and Eastern Route Armies approached Liu and Wu, forming a powerful pincer offensive, our Central Route Army also launched a major offensive along the Xiang-Gui-Qian Railway, taking Quanxian with overwhelming force. The bandit 226th Division, 174th Division, 88th Division, and 87th Division initially attempted to stop our army's advance, but once they made contact, they fled in panic. The Liberation Army advanced rapidly, occupying Xing'an on the 21st and Lingchuan on the 22nd; and annihilating a portion of the bandit Provisional 1st Division in the area of the large and small Rongjiang Rivers. Simultaneously with the liberation of Lingchuan, another unit of our army, with a raid of more than a hundred li, broke into Guilin city at 2:00 PM on the 22nd, completely annihilating the remnants of the bandit Provisional 1st Division. More than a thousand bandits surrendered with their weapons.
    During the Liberation Army's advance, the White bandits along the way displayed their insane bestiality, wantonly destroying railways, highways, and bridges, deliberately sinking ships everywhere, collapsing riverbanks, and implementing the so-called "scorched earth policy," forcing the people along the transportation lines and waterways to evacuate, smashing pots, bowls, mortars, and cooking utensils. However, our heroic and invincible People's Liberation Army carried forward the tradition of hard struggle, overcame all difficulties, and, moreover, because our army's discipline was strict, not violating the slightest thing, and strictly adhering to the policy of uniting minority nationalities, the various ethnic groups along the way returned from the mountains to prepare grain and send grass to support the troops' advance. Shops in the towns also operated as usual, and vendors gathered along the roads. The rumors spread by the bandit army were defeated without attack, and the people quickly returned home to assist the Liberation Army in its advance. Our Western Route troops entered minority areas and were warmly welcomed by the Miao and Zhuang people. They cheered, "Our troops have come!" The residents of the mountain villages, young and old, offered kind regards to the Liberation Army, sending grain and pigs for their comfort. After the People's Guerrilla Armed Forces and Zhuang Armed Forces in the Guizhou-Guangxi border area victoriously joined forces with the main force of the Liberation Army, the guerrillas served as guides to assist in clearing out scattered bandits and maintaining local order. At present, our various armies entering Guangxi, with the enthusiastic support of the various ethnic groups in Guangxi, are continuing to vigorously pursue and annihilate the fleeing bandits.

　　我三路大军长驱疾进
  　广西四大都市克其三
    记者报道解放桂林柳州梧州经过
    【新华社华南前线二十七日电】前线记者报道：人民解放军第四野战军进军广西，解放桂林、柳州、梧州的经过称：人民解放军第四野战军执行朱总司令命令，为解放广西歼灭蒋桂残匪，于本月七日起，自湘南前线分三路展开强大进攻，截至二十五日止，经过十九天的连续行军作战，克服了白匪破坏交通的种种困难，解放县城十八座，广西省四大都市桂林、柳州、梧州、南宁中，除南宁一地外，均告解放。
    在此次进军中，我西路大军越过湘黔桂边境，踏着一九三零年中国工农红军第七军北上时的故道，通过泥泞载道的山区，首将湘黔边区的残余匪伪一举肃清，进驻靖县、通道（再度解放）。十三、十四两日，我军解放黔东南的黎平、榕江、从江三城，随即兼程疾进，突入广西北部，从十九日至二十四日六天内连克三江、宜北、融县、罗城、思恩等城，于二十五日上午十一时一举占领湘桂、黔桂铁路交义点的柳州城。东路大军由零陵横渡潇水，不顾昼夜行军的疲劳，直奔桂东。自十九日起至二十五日止，我军先后解放富川、钟山、信都、贺县、阳朔等城，二十五日十八时，一举攻占桂东重镇的梧州市，当我西、东两路大军进逼柳、梧，形成强大的钳形攻势时，我中路大军亦沿湘桂黔铁路大举出动，以排山倒海之势直取全县。匪二二六师、一七四师、八十八师、八十七师等部，初尚企图阻止我军前进，但一经接触，即仓皇溃窜。解放军长驱直进，二十一日进占兴安，二十二日进占灵川；并于大小榕江一带歼灭匪暂一师一部。与解放灵川同时，我军另部则以百余里之奔袭，于二十二日午二时突入桂林市区，全歼匪暂一师残部。匪军携械投诚者千余名。
    在解放军进军途中，沿途白匪逞其疯狂兽性，大肆破坏铁路、公路及桥梁，到处凿沉船只，炸坍河岸，并实行所谓“空室清野”，强迫沿交通线及河道的人民疏散，打碎锅、碗、臼及炊具。但我英勇无敌的人民解放军，发扬了艰苦奋斗的传统，克服了一切困难，更由于我军纪律严明，秋毫无犯，并严格遵守团结少数民族政策，因此大军所至，沿途各族人民均纷纷从山上回家筹粮、送草，支援部队前进。各城镇商店亦照常营业，摊贩聚设路旁。匪军所散布的谣言不攻自破，民众均迅速回家，协助解放军前进。我西路部队进入少数民族区域，更受到苗族和僮族人民的热烈欢迎。他们欢呼着：“我们的队伍来了！”山寨居民均扶老携幼，向解放军亲切慰问，送粮，送猪慰劳。黔桂边境的人民游击武装及僮人武装与解放军主力部队胜利会师后，游击队员们即担任向导，协助清剿散匪，维护地方秩序。现我各路入桂大军，在广西各族人民热情支援之下，正继续猛烈追歼逃匪中。
