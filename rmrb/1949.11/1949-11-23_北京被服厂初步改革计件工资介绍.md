Introduction to the Preliminary Piece-Rate Wage Reform at the Beijing Garment Factory
　　Zhang Jiachi
　　The wages at the Beijing Garment Factory of the Logistics Department of the North China Military Region are divided into two types based on the nature of the work: fixed wages and piece-rate wages. Those receiving fixed wages include staff, technicians, foremen, repair workers, transportation workers, and general service personnel. Piece-rate wages apply to workers such as sewing workers, cutting workers, and overlockers. During the Kuomintang rule, the factory's compensation was based on military establishment standards. All employees received a basic wage of 48.5 jin (catty) of staple food (rice) and welfare rations. In addition to the basic wage, fixed workers received fixed salaries in four grades and sixteen levels. Skilled workers (i.e., sewing, cutting, etc. workers) received additional piece-rate wages. Due to rampant inflation and the devaluation of the pseudo-gold yuan currency at that time, the proportion of piece-rate wages earned by skilled workers was extremely small in the months before liberation, so there was very little difference in the income of each person. In addition, wages were often paid in countless installments, and workers simply did not know how much money they earned each month. The piece-rate wage system had completely lost its function. After liberation, according to the regulations of the Beijing Military Control Commission, the average wage of the three months of September and November last year was converted into millet expenditure. Generally, workers received 88.45 jin of millet for staple food, and 29.895 jin for welfare difference (the difference between the price of welfare goods and the market price. Although welfare goods were no longer rationed after liberation, this difference was still paid.). The total basic wage was 118 jin. The piece-rate wage income of skilled workers has recovered to account for about 55% of their total personal income, so it has a little significance. However, because the original base number still exists, some backward workers still do not work hard. Their argument is: "Whether I work hard or not, I can get 118 jin of millet anyway." In addition, there are also some shortcomings that hinder the workers' production enthusiasm. For example, when production is stopped due to a shortage of raw materials, overlockers among the skilled workers do not receive idle-time subsidies. They all only receive a basic wage of 118 jin, which does not show any difference in skill level. Other skilled workers are paid idle-time subsidies at 85% of the average output of the previous three months. Because their piece-rate wage income only accounts for half of their total wage, it becomes even less after being discounted by 15%, so the phenomenon of egalitarianism becomes more obvious.
　　Based on the above situation, the factory submitted a request to the Logistics Department for approval to change to a full piece-rate wage system starting from the first phase of the winter clothing task in late July, and abolish the egalitarian part of the skilled workers' wages—staple food and welfare difference—according to the principle of "more work, more pay". A unit price for various jobs was set, and technical quotas for skilled workers were stipulated. The specific methods are as follows: First, stipulate the standard wage for various skilled workers, and then the laboratory actually tests the technical quotas for various skilled workers to produce various jobs. For example, if the standard wage of a front sewing machine operator is 317 jin, and the experimental result of the standard output of 10 hours per day can produce 7 sets of cotton clothes, then the unit price wage for each set is about 1 jin and 11 liang. After everything was prepared, a meeting of employee representatives from various branches, cotton batting factories, and cotton fluffing workshops was held on July 19 to announce this reform. However, at that time, many representatives disagreed. They thought that if the staple food was cancelled, their lives would not be guaranteed, and they had ideological concerns, but they did not know that the unit price of wages had been increased (for example, the front sewing of cotton clothes was only more than 15 liang per piece according to the previous wages, but now it has been increased to more than 1 jin and 11 liang). It was not until the end of July when the wages were paid that everyone realized that the new wages were more reasonable and that they could earn more by doing more, and the doubts completely disappeared. As of the end of September, the achievements that have been made are:
　　1. The new wage system has stimulated workers' interest in pursuing technology, and individual output has increased significantly. For example, Jin Shuren, a front sewing machine operator in the Second Branch, made an average of 12.28 sets per day during the 34-day sprint of the first phase of the winter clothing task (because the average working time was 12 hours per day during the sprint). Cotton batting workers could only make an average of one and a half sets per person per day (8 hours) last year, but now the Tianqiao Cotton Batting Workshop can make an average of 2.7 sets per person per day (12 hours). The highest can reach 4.8 sets.
　　2. The new wage system allows overtime workers to earn more wages, thus ensuring the completion of the first phase of the winter clothing task sprint.
　　3. The phenomenon of "loafing on the job" in the workshop has been eliminated, and people who "don't work hard but still get 118 jin of millet" can no longer get away with it. In the past, a few backward front sewing machine operators only made one or two sets a day, and could still earn 144 jin of millet per month. Now, those who make one set a day can only get 52 jin per month, and they have to deduct one-eighth of the wages of the assistant worker, and actually get 48 jin and 12 liang. Those who make two sets only get 97.5 jin, so the situation of too low output has almost been completely eliminated. In August, there were only two front sewing machine operators in the Second Branch with an average daily output of less than two sets, and only four in the First Branch (due to illness or other special reasons).
　　4. Wage income has generally increased. Taking the Second Branch as an example, only 7 people earned 159 jin in the first half of April, accounting for less than 2%, but in the first half of September, the number of people earning the same wage has increased to 75.7%.
　　5. During idle time, the idle-time subsidies for various piece-rate workers—cutting, sewing, overlocking, etc.—are paid at 85% of their respective skill levels, divided into six grades of wages, so the previous phenomenon of egalitarianism has been completely eliminated.
　　6. The status of assistant workers has been improved. In the past, assistant workers received a "reward" from the sewing machine operator in addition to the monthly staple food and welfare difference. Therefore, the assistant worker was subordinate to the sewing machine operator and had no independent status. In this wage reform, assistant workers were also changed to piece-rate workers. An assistant worker takes care of four sewing machine operators, and each sewing machine operator can get four liang of millet for producing one set (referring to the front sewing of cotton clothes). The more the sewing machine operator does, the more the assistant worker will inevitably do, so the assistant worker's wage will also be higher. In this way, the sewing machine operator has no control over the assistant worker.
　　Practice has proved that the piece-rate wage system is the most effective system for promoting increased output and quality, improving technology, reducing costs, and improving workers' lives. This year, public enterprises in Northeast China have begun to learn from the Sino-Soviet joint venture factories in Dalian to implement it. In Beijing, the garment factory is just the beginning. Although it has achieved some results and has been generally accepted by the workers, there are still many problems.
　　First, the technical quota should be determined based on the technical level of general workers. Too high or too low will reduce its role in stimulating increased output and improved technology. The individual output standard set by the Beijing Garment Factory this time is still somewhat high or somewhat low. For example, the front sewing machine operators were initially required to produce seven and a half sets per person per day for ten hours, and later changed to seven sets, but it is still relatively high. According to the statistics in August, the average output of the First Branch was only 7.056 sets per person per day at most, the Second Branch could only do 6.7 sets per person per day, and the Third Branch could only do more than 5 sets per person per day. And in August, due to the sprint task, the average working hours were about 12 hours. If the working hours return to 10 hours, fewer people will be able to meet the standard. However, the standard of 28 sets for back sewing machine operators seems slightly low. In August, the average daily output of all back sewing machine operators exceeded 32 sets per person. According to the experience of factories in the Dalian area, in order to rationalize the piece-rate wage—that is, "to each according to his work"—it is necessary to advance simultaneously with the rationalization of production. If production is unplanned, the organization of labor is not reasonable, and there is no precise cost accounting, then the labor value produced by each worker cannot be determined. Therefore, when determining the unit price of wages, we can only subjectively set a standard wage first. In the future, if the Beijing Garment Factory wants to further rationalize wages, it must establish planned production and cost accounting to achieve the rationalization of production management.
　　Second, a strict quality inspection system must be implemented simultaneously with the implementation of the piece-rate wage system. There has been a tendency to neglect quality in this implementation of the piece-rate wage system. At the beginning of the first phase of the winter clothing task, it was found that some factories had a large number of substandard clothes returned for dismantling and alteration. At the same time, the inspection personnel of some branches had the phenomenon of saving face and being irresponsible.
　　Third, attention must be paid to workers' health and machine maintenance when implementing the piece-rate wage system. In mid-August, in order to sprint for winter clothing, free overtime was allowed, and some workers worked up to 16 hours a day. This has an impact on the health of both workers and machines.
　　Fourth, attention must be paid to saving raw materials when implementing the piece-rate wage system. In order to cut faster, the workers in the cutting department cut the round opening at the upper end of the sleeves into a square opening. The sewing machine operators have the tendency to wind too much thread on the bobbin in pursuit of fast movements. These are all worthy of attention.

　　北京被服厂初步改革计件工资介绍
　　张家炽
    华北军区军需部北京被服厂工资根据工作性质分为固定工资与计件工资两种。固定工资所得者为职员、技佐、领班、修理工人、运输工人及勤杂人员等；计件工资包括缝纫工、裁剪工、锁缀工等工人。在国民党统治时期，该厂待遇按军事编制，所有职工都有主食四十八斤半（大米）及福利配售品等基本工资；除基本工资外，固定工另加四等十六级固定薪金；能力工（即指缝纫、裁剪等工人）另加计件工资。因当时物价高涨，伪金元券贬值，至解放前数月，能力工所得计件工资比重极小，因此各人所得相差也就很小了。加以工资往往分无数次发给，工人根本不知道自已究竟每月赚多少钱。计件工资已完全失去作用。解放后，该厂根据北京市军管会的规定，以去年九、十一三个月工资的平均数合成小米开支，一般工人主食可得小米八八·四五斤，福利配差（福利品配售与市价的差额。解放后虽已不再配售福利品，但此差数仍旧发给。）二九·八九五斤，合计基本工资一百一十八斤。能力工的计件工资所得已恢复到占个人总收入的百分之五十五左右，因此多少有了一点计件工资的意义。但因原来基数仍然存在，所以有一部分落后工人仍不好好干活，他们的说法是：“干不干反正有一百一十八斤小米可拿。”此外也还有一些缺点阻碍着工人的生产积极性。如在原料供不上停工时，能力工中的锁缀工是没有停工待料津贴的，他们一律都只有一百一十八斤基本工资，一点也显不出技术高下。其他的能力工是按其前三月的产量平均数打八五折发给停工津贴的，因其计件工资收入只占全部工资的一半，打了八五折之后，就更少了，因此平均主义现象就愈加明显。
    基于上述情形，该厂自七月下旬第一期冬装任务开始时，即呈请军需部批准改为全部计件工资，按“多劳多酬”的原则取消能力工工资中的平均主义部分——主食与福利配差，另定各种活计的工资单价，规定能力工的技术定额。其具体办法如下：先规定各种能力工的标准工资，再由试验室实际试验各种能力工制作各种活计的技术定额，如一个前车工的标准工资为三百一十七斤，每天十小时标准产量实验结果可制棉衣七套，每月以二十六日计，则其每套单价工资即为一斤十一两左右。在一切准备好之后，七月十九日召开各分厂、铺棉工厂，弹花工场的职工代表会，宣布这一改革。但当时好些代表都不同意，他们以为主食取消，生活就没了保障，思想上有顾虑，而不知单件工资已提高（如棉衣前车，按以前工资每件只有十五两多，现在已增加到一斤十一两多）。直到七月底工资发下时，大家才知道新工资多做多赚，合理得多，疑虑才完全消失。到九月底止，已获得的成绩是：
    一、新工资刺激了工人追求技术的兴趣，个人产量有显著的增高。如第二分厂前车工人靳树仁在第一期冬装任务三十四天的突击中，平均每天做了十二·二八套（因在突击期间，每天平均十二小时）。铺棉工人去年平均每人每天（八小时）只能做一套半，现在天桥铺棉工场平均每人每天（十二小时）可做到二·七套。最高的可达到四·八套。
    二、新工资使加班工人获得更多的工资，因此保证了第一期冬装任务突击完成。
    三、肃清了工场中的“泡蘑菇”现象，“干不干一百一十八斤小米”的人吃不开了。以前有少数落后前车工人每天只做一、二套，每月也可以挣一百四十四斤小米，现在每天做一套的每月就只能得五十二斤，还要减去副工工资八分之一，实得四十八斤十二两，做两套的只得九十七斤半，所以产量过低的情形已几乎全部消灭。八月份第二分厂前车平均每天产量在二套以下的只有二人，第一分厂只有四人（因病或其他特殊原因）。
    四、工资所得已普遍提高，以第二分厂为例，全部缝纫工在四月上半月挣一百五十九斤的只有七人，只占百分之二弱，但九月上半月得同样工资的已增加到百分之七十五点七。
    五、在停工待料时，各种计件工——裁剪、缝级、锁缀等的停工待料津贴，一律按其能力高下分为六级工资打八五折开支，所以以前的平均主义现象是彻底扫除了。
    六、副工的地位提高了。过去副工除每月得到主食与福利配差外，由缝纫工随意“外赏”。因此副工是附属于缝纫工的，没有自己独立的地位。此次改革工资中，副工也改为计件工。一个副工照顾四个缝纫工，每个缝纫工生产一套（指棉衣前车），副工可得四两小米。缝纫工做得多，副工也必然多做，因此副工工资也多。这样，缝纫工对副工就没有了约束。
    实践证明：计件工资是促进提高产量质量，改进技术，减低成本，改善工人生活中最有效的制度。东北各公营企业今年已开始向旅大中苏合营工厂学习实行，在北京，被服厂尚为一开端，虽然它已有了一些成绩，已为工人普遍接受，但其中问题还很多。
    第一、技术定额的规定，应该以一般工人的技术水平为标准，过高或过低都会减低其刺激提高产量提高技术的作用，北京被服厂此次规定的个人产量标准还有些较高或有些较低。如前车工最初规定每人每天十小时生产七套半，后又改为七套，但仍然较高。根据八月份的统计，第一分厂平均产量，最高每人每天才做七·○五六套，二分厂每人每天只能做六·七套，三分厂每人每天才做五套多，而八月份因系突击任务，平均工时为十二小时左右，若工时回复到十小时，能达到标准的就少了。但后车工标准二十八套则似略低，八月份全部后车工平均每人每天产量均超过三十二套。根据旅大区工厂的经验，要计件工资合理化——即“按劳取酬”——必须与生产合理化同时并进，如生产无计划，劳动力组织不够合理，无精确的成本会计，则每一工人所生产的劳动价值就不能确定，因此在决定工资单价时，也只好主观地先定出一个标准工资。今后北京被服厂要更进一步做到工资合理化，必须确立计划生产与成本计算，做到生产管理的合理化。
    第二、实行计件工资必须同时实行严格的质量检查制度，这次实行计件工资已有忽视质量的偏向。在第一期冬装任务开始时，曾发现个别厂有大量的不合标准的衣服退回拆改，同时有些分厂的检验人员有顾面子不负责任的现象。
    第三、实行计件工资必须照顾工人健康，注意爱护机器，在八月中为了突击冬装，允许自由加班，曾有工人每天工作到十六小时的。这样对工人与机器的健康都有影响。
    第四、实行计件工资必须注意节省原料。裁剪部工人为了裁得快，曾将袖子上端圆口裁成方口，车工在追求快的动作中有把梭子上的线绕得太多等偏向。这些都是值得注意的。
