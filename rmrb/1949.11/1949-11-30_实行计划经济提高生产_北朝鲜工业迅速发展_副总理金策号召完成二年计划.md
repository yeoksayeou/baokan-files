Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 29th. At a conference of activists from industrial and economic departments and trade unions on the 19th, Korean Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Industry Kim Chaek, in summarizing the achievements of the first nine months of the two-year people's economic plan, first pointed out that the purpose of the conference was to correctly assess the past achievements of the industrial sector, seriously review shortcomings, and exchange experiences. He then specifically reported on the industrial development of the northern half of the Republic in the four years since liberation, saying that the industrial output of the northern half of the Republic is increasing year by year. Taking 1946 as 100, it increased to 189.3 percent in 1947, 263.3 percent in 1948, and will increase to 377.1 percent in 1949. This not only restored many industries destroyed when Japan surrendered, but also built many that did not exist during the Japanese imperialist rule, such as industrial electric wires, storage batteries, transformers, ball bearings, electric motors, copper wires, ironclad ships, porcelain, and double-sided paper. At present, mechanical production and light industrial production have exceeded the production level of 1944. Taking 1944 as 100, the mechanical production in September this year reached 246.9 percent, and the light industrial production reached 152.7 percent, among which the copper, lead, zinc, soybean oil, starch, paper making, cotton weaving, and silk weaving industries developed the fastest. In the past four years, as a result of the North Korean people's own control of political power and the economic lifeline of the country such as factories, mines, railways, and banks, and the implementation of a planned economy, the bias of the colonial economy left over from the Japanese rule has been gradually overcome, and the foundation for a national independent and autonomous economy has been laid.
　　
Kim Chaek went on to point out that in the past four years, not only has the means of industrial production been expanded and developed, but also labor productivity has been continuously improved. Taking 1946 as 100, the productivity in 1947 was 170.7 percent, 235.8 percent in 1948, and 283.4 percent in 1949. With the increase in labor productivity, workers' wages have also increased. Taking 1946 as the base, it was 134 percent in 1947, 146 percent in 1948, and 152.8 percent in 1949.

　　实行计划经济提高生产
  　北朝鲜工业迅速发展
    副总理金策号召完成二年计划
    【新华社平壤二十九日电】朝鲜副总理兼产业部长金策，十九日在产业经济部门和工会积极分子大会上总结二年人民经济计划开头九个月的成果时，首先指出这次会议的目的，在于正确估计过去产业部门的成绩，认真严肃地检讨缺点和交流经验。接着，他具体地报告解放后四年来共和国北半部产业发展的情形说：共和国北半部的工业生产量，正在一年年增加。以一九四六年为一百，则一九四七年增加到百分之一八九·三，一九四八年增加到百分之二六三·三，一九四九年将增加到百分之三七七·一。这不仅恢复了不少日本投降时被破坏的工业，而且新建了不少日本帝国主义统治时代所没有的，如工业电线、蓄电机、变压器、滚珠、电动机、铜线、铁甲船、磁器、两面纸等。现在，机械生产和轻工业生产，已超过了一九四四年的生产水平。如以一九四四年为一百，则今年九月机械生产已达百分之二四六·九，轻工业生产已达百分之一五二·七，其中尤以铜、铅、亚铅、豆油、淀粉、造纸、棉织、绢织等业，发展最快。四年来，北朝鲜人民由于自己掌握了政权和工厂、矿山、铁道、银行等国家经济命脉而实行计划经济的结果，逐渐克服了日本统治时代所留下的殖民地经济的偏枯性，奠定了民族独立自主经济的基础。
    金策继指出，四年来，不仅工业的生产手段扩大和发展了，而且劳动生产率也不断地提高。如以一九四六年为一百，则一九四七年的生产率是百分之一七零·七，一九四八年是百分之二三五·八，一九四九年是百分之二八三·四。随着劳动生产率的提高，工人的工资也提高了。如以一九四六年为基准，则一九四七年是百分之一三四，一九四八年是百分之一四六，一九四九年是百分之一五二·八。
