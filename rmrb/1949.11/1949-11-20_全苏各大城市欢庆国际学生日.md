　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 19th: TASS reports: On the 17th, Moscow, Minsk, Stalingrad, Kharkov and other cities in the Soviet Union warmly celebrated International Students' Day. A city-wide student conference was held in Moscow, where Romanovsky, Secretary of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, delivered a speech. Higher education institutions in Minsk, the capital of the Belorussian Republic, held a grand exhibition illustrating the struggle of democratic youth around the world for peace, as well as lectures on International Students' Day. Students at the Stalingrad Teachers College also passed a resolution guaranteeing to contribute all their strength to the cause of peace.
　　The Soviet Communist Youth League's "Pravda" published an article by Josef Grohman, Chairman of the World Student Union, stating that the Union has achieved great success in mobilizing democratic students to fight for peace and a better future. This International Students' Day is celebrated in the context of intensified struggle against reactionaries and splitters who are eager to undermine the unity of the democratic youth movement and divert students from the path of fighting for their own vital interests. However, all attempts to establish groups against the World Student Union have completely failed.

　　全苏各大城市欢庆国际学生日
    【新华社北京十九日电】塔斯社讯：十七日，苏联首都莫斯科、明斯克、斯大林格勒、哈尔科夫和苏联其他城市都热烈庆祝国际学生日。莫斯科举行了全市学生大会，世界青联书记罗曼诺夫斯基在会上发表了演说。白俄罗斯共和国首都明斯克的高等教育机关，举办了说明全世界民主青年为和平而斗争的盛大展览会及关于国际学生日的讲演会。斯大林格勒师范学院的学生们也通过了保证以他们全部的力量贡献给和平事业的决议。
    苏联共产主义青年团真理报刊登世界学联主席约瑟夫·格罗曼的专文称：学联在动员民主学生为和平与更美好的将来而斗争方面，已获得了巨大的成就。这次的国际学生日是在与反动分子和分裂分子加紧斗争的情况下庆祝的，这些反动分子和分裂分子亟欲破坏民主青年运动的团结，使学生们离开为他们自己切身利益而斗争的道路。然而一切想建立反对世界学联的各种集团的企图，都完全失败了。
