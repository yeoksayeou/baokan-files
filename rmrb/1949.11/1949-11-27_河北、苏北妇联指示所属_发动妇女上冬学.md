　　Hebei and Northern Jiangsu Women's Federations Instruct Subordinates
　　Mobilize Women to Attend Winter School
　　[Baoding News] The Hebei Provincial Democratic Women's Federation, in order to mobilize the broad masses of women to participate in winter school, recently issued the following instructions: 1. Women cadres at all levels should participate in the Winter School Movement Committee to promote the participation of women in winter school. 2. Women's Federations at all levels should pay attention to the leadership of the winter school movement, break the erroneous understanding that "the winter movement conflicts with the central task," and use winter school as a place to promote the central task and strengthen political and ideological education, but it is also wrong to disrupt the winter school progress and treat winter school as a women's congress. 3. In order to promote this work, in addition to county and district cadres going to the countryside to personally give political lessons and maternal and child health business lessons to the winter school, Women's Federations at all levels should pay attention to actively mobilizing female teachers or family-based intellectual women to voluntarily serve as winter school teachers. 4. Mobilizing women to participate in winter school should be based on voluntarism, and should not be forcibly compiled. Also, the emphasis on voluntarism should not lead to abandoning repeated mobilization and persuasion, resulting in winter school running wild. When carrying out this work, the desire of the broad masses of women to learn to read, reason, and understand things should be inspired, illiterates should be organized to speak out about their grievances to awaken them, so they will want to learn, and create favorable conditions for carrying out the winter school movement. 5. Clear away obstacles to women's learning. Experience has shown that women are often restricted by their parents-in-law or husbands, and cannot attend school or are abused when they do. In this case, activists can be organized to persuade, mediate, or hold family democratic meetings where both parties conduct self-criticism and criticism to solve the problem, opposing ignoring it or solving it through struggle. The burden of children will also hinder women's enrollment. Therefore, if women have a high enthusiasm for learning but cannot attend school, a "little teacher" system can be established to maintain their learning enthusiasm and overcome difficulties in learning.
　　[Northern Jiangsu News] The Northern Jiangsu Democratic Women's Federation sent a letter to Women's Federations at all levels on the 15th, calling for the extensive mobilization of women to participate in winter school learning, improve women's political awareness and cultural level, implement winter production and famine prevention work, and lay the foundation for future women's education work on this basis. In terms of educational content, women should be given education on production and famine prevention. In water control areas, women should discuss how to participate in water control. In areas with more serious disasters, women should actively participate in various agricultural and sideline productions, emphasizing that labor transforms women's social and economic status. Women should be given current affairs education, publicizing the establishment of the Central People's Government, and educating women to recognize and exercise the rights given to them by the new government. Cultural literacy and maternal and child health education should be carried out.

　　河北、苏北妇联指示所属
  　发动妇女上冬学
    【保定讯】河北省民主妇联，为发动广大妇女参加冬学，顷指示：一、各级妇女干部应参加冬学运动委员会，以便推动广大妇女参加冬学。二、各级妇联应注意冬学运动的领导、打破“冬运与中心工作矛盾”的错误认识、应以冬学做为推动中心工作加强政治思想教育的场所，但如打乱冬学进度把冬学当成妇代会也是不对的。三、各级妇联为了推动这一工作，除县区干部下乡后，亲自给冬学上政治课、妇婴卫生业务课外，要注意积极动员女教员或家庭知识妇女，自愿的作冬学教师。四、动员妇女参加冬学，要根据自愿，不应硬编，也不应因为强调自愿，就放弃了反复的动员说服，以致使冬学自流。进行这一工作时，应在广大的妇女群众中启发其识字讲理明事的要求，有准备的组织文盲诉苦，启发觉悟，达到要求学习，造成开展冬学运动的有利条件。五、扫清妇女学习的障碍，经验证明，往往妇女因受公婆或丈夫限制，而不能入学或因入学而被虐待，在这种情况下，可组织积极分子劝解，调解或开家庭民主会双方检讨批评等方式以求得问题的解决，反对置之不理或用斗争方式解决。孩子的负担也会障碍妇女入学，因之如有妇女学习情绪高而又不能入学的，可建立小先生制，保持其学习热情，克服学习中的困难。
    【苏北讯】苏北民主妇联十五日给各级妇联一封信，号召广泛发动妇女参加冬学学习，提高妇女政治觉悟与文化水平，贯彻冬季生产防荒工作，并在这一基础上打下今后开展妇女教育工作的基础。在教育内容上，应该给妇女以生产防荒教育，治水区，妇女要讨论如何去参加治水；灾荒较严重地区，妇女要积极参加各种农业、副业生产，强调劳动改造妇女社会地位和经济地位。应给妇女以时事教育，宣传中央人民政府的成立，教育妇女认识与运用新政府给妇女的权利。应开展文化识字和妇婴卫生教员。
