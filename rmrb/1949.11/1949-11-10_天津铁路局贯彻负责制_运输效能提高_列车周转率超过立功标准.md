　　Tianjin Railway Bureau Implements Responsibility System
  　Transportation Efficiency Improves
  　Train Turnaround Rate Exceeds Merit Standard
    [Report from this newspaper] After the Tianjin Railway Bureau implemented and enforced various responsibility systems, significant achievements were made in transportation operations. Since the implementation of various responsibility systems, the work efficiency in July, August, and September has been gradually increasing. After a month of effort in September, the average train turnaround rate for the entire bureau in October reached 1.85, exceeding the standard for the production and thrift merit campaign. It also shortened the September plan of 1.96 by 0.11, creating a new record. This is the result of the overall improvement of various technical operation standards. The average daily mileage of locomotives in the entire bureau has reached 290 kilometers, exceeding the plan by 3 percent. The technical speed has reached 30.9 kilometers, and the loading rate averaged 29.3 tons. The Tianjin, Tangshan, and Zhangjiakou regions have exceeded 30 tons. The driving speed between Beijing and Tianjin is 80 kilometers, between Tianjin and Shanhaiguan 65 kilometers, and between Tianjin and Pukou 50 to 65 kilometers. The political awareness of employees has generally improved, and the attitude towards labor has changed. Since the launch of the production and thrift merit campaign in July, a general voluntary labor movement among all employees has penetrated various departments, and meritorious overtime work has become a common phenomenon. For example, in amateur road maintenance, the number of participants accounted for 65.5 percent of the total number of people. In the 53 days of work by thousands of hands, 286 kilometers were renovated, and roadbeds that had not been cleaned for ten to forty years were cleared. Over 714,000 jin of millet in wages were saved, ensuring traffic safety and increasing traffic speed. The Nankou and Zhangjiakou material factories contributed 1,479 hours of work in one month. In the Tianjin East Station Locomotive Depot, people automatically worked overtime on Sundays for emergency repairs. Many station masters between Beijing and Tianjin took the lead in mobilizing the repair of houses. Dispatching offices and key station operations personnel implemented a fixed shift system and launched competitions, which played a significant role in improving the turnaround rate and won collective rewards.

　　天津铁路局贯彻负责制
  　运输效能提高
  　列车周转率超过立功标准
    【本报讯】天津铁路管理局推行与贯彻各种负责制后，运输业务获显著成绩。该局自推行各种负责制以来，七八九月份工作效率是逐步上升的，经九月份一个月努力结果，十月份列车周转率全局平均已达一·八五，超出生产节约立功运动标准，比九月份计划一·九六也缩短了○·一一，造成新纪录。是各种技术作业标准普遍提高的结果，全局机车平均日行公里已达二九○公里，超出计划百分之三，技术速度已达三○·九公里，装载率平均二九·三吨，天津、唐山、张家口三个地区已超过三○吨，京津间行车速度八○公里，津山间六五公里，津浦间五○到六五公里。职工政治觉悟普遍提高，劳动态度改变。自七月生产节约立功运动开展后，全路职工普遍的义务劳动运动已深入各部门，立功加班成了普遍现象，如业余养路，参加人数占全人数百分之六十五点五，在千万支手的五十三天工作中，翻身了二百八十六公里，清理了十年到四十年未经清理过的路基；节省工资小米七十一万四千多斤，保证了行车安全，提高了行车速度。南口张家口两材料厂，一个月献工即达一千四百七十九小时；天津东站机务段星期日还有人自动加班抢修，京津间许多站长带头动员修理房屋，各调度所与主要站运转人员实行了固定固班制，展开竞赛，对周转率提高上起了很大作用，曾获得集体奖励。
