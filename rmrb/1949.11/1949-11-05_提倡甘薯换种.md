　　1. Why Promote Sweet Potato Variety Replacement?

　　The two types of foreign sweet potatoes (namely, Agricultural and Forestry No. 4 and Victory No. 100 sweet potatoes) promoted by our farm this year have been warmly welcomed by farmers everywhere. This is because their yield is more than double that of local sweet potatoes (in good water fields in the suburbs of Shijiazhuang, the maximum yield per mu can reach 6,000 jin, and the average weight of a single sweet potato is 2.5 to 3 jin), and the vines are short, eliminating the need for vine turning, which saves labor. These significant advantages have been proven by facts. Therefore, the cultivation quantity next year must be several times greater than this year. In order to ensure the smooth progress of the promotion work next year, the "seed potatoes" for cultivating seedlings next spring must be fully prepared now, and the masses should not be allowed to use these valuable varieties to make flour or eat them.

　　This spring, our farm cultivated one million sweet potato seedlings, which were promoted in Shijiazhuang City and nearby Zhengding, Huolu, Lingshou, Gaocheng, Yuanshi counties, and Taiyuan, Handan, Baoding and other regions. A total of about 350 mu can be planted. If the average yield per mu is calculated at 4,000 jin, then 1.4 million jin of sweet potatoes can be harvested. If all of these are used as "seed potatoes" this year, with 50 jin of seed potatoes required per mu (usually 50 jin of sweet potatoes can cultivate 3,000 sweet potato seedlings, enough for one mu), then 28,000 mu can be propagated next year. If two-thirds are used as seed potatoes, 18,000 to 19,000 mu can also be propagated.

　　As the saying goes, "One mu of sweet potatoes equals two mu of grain." If the above-mentioned 1.4 million jin of sweet potatoes can be controlled in a planned way, it will have great significance in agricultural production and in solving the food problem of the masses.

　　2. How to Select and Retain "Seed Potatoes"

　　The first step in sweet potato variety replacement is to select and retain "seed potatoes" in advance. When selecting, pay attention to the following points:

　　(1) Choose those with high yields: choose the variety that yields the most sweet potatoes.

　　(2) Choose those with the characteristics of the variety (choose the same leaf shape, vines, tuber shape, and color).

　　(3) Try to choose from wheat stubble fields, because the sweet potato tubers from wheat stubble are neat, produce more seedlings, and have fewer infectious diseases.

　　(4) Choose those dug before frost, because those harvested before frost are not easily rotten and are easy to store.

　　(5) Choose those without breaks, insect or rodent bites, and diseases.

　　(6) Choose medium-sized sweet potato tubers, because large tubers are wasteful, and small tubers produce weak seedlings.

　　After the "seed potatoes" are selected, they should be carefully preserved, eaten and sold as little as possible, and not made into flour, so as to be exchanged, so that the masses of farmers can universally plant them next year.

　　3. Methods of Promoting Variety Replacement

　　As mentioned above, the number of foreign sweet potatoes produced this year is enough to be promoted to 20,000 mu next year. But the key issue is how to lead and organize the masses to universally select and retain seed potatoes, and to ensure that the masses consciously and widely launch the variety replacement movement. Sweet potatoes are now being harvested one after another. Governments at all levels and production leading organs should attach importance to this work. To this end, we put forward some suggestions here for reference:

　　(1) Each village should mobilize farmers to exchange varieties with each other.

　　(2) If there are very few sweet potatoes planted in a village, not enough for mutual exchange, the village cadres can be responsible for organizing them to exchange collectively in villages with more foreign sweet potatoes planted.

　　(3) Purchase by cooperatives is a more powerful method. Currently, sweet potatoes are being harvested. Cooperatives at all levels can go to villages with more foreign sweet potatoes planted to purchase them, and then systematically distribute and sell them to villages or farmers who need seed potatoes.

　　(4) Exchange price ratio: For those who exchange with local sweet potatoes, add about four liang per jin. For those who exchange with rice, according to the general rule of Shijiazhuang Prefectural Commissioner's Office that each county has followed over the years, each jin of rice can be exchanged for about five jin of sweet potatoes when sweet potatoes first come down, and each jin of rice can be exchanged for about three jin of sweet potatoes when sweet potatoes are scarce in the spring. Localities can exchange according to the habits of the masses or the methods agreed upon by both parties.

　　(5) Order now and transport in the spring: In order to avoid excessive overturning and injury (such as excessive loading, unloading, entering the kiln, and exiting the kiln, which are easy to damage) and the impact of sweet potatoes being frozen during transportation, the best way is to order now and transport them next spring.

### 提倡甘薯换种

　　提倡甘薯换种
    华北农场
　　一　为什么要提倡甘薯换种
    今年本场推广的两种洋山药（即农林四号和胜利百号甘薯），已经获得了各地农民的热烈欢迎。因为它的产量比本地山药能多收一倍（在石家庄市郊的好水地里，最多的一亩能收六千斤，平均一棵山药有二斤半到三斤重），并且蔓子短，不用翻蔓，节省人工，这种显著的优点，已为事实证明，所以明年的栽培数量，一定要有超过今年数倍的可能。为了使明年的推广工作能够顺利进行，明春培育秧苗用的“种薯”，现在就必须要充分的准备，不要让群众把这可宝贵的品种都拿去做了粉，或者吃在肚内了。
    今天春季本场曾培育了一百万棵山药秧，推广在石市及附近的正定、获鹿、灵寿、藁城、元氏等县和太原、邯郸、保定等地区，共可栽植三百五十来亩，每亩产量若平均按四千斤计算就能收一百四十万斤山药。如果今年再全部用以作“种薯”用，每亩需种薯五十斤算，（普通五十斤山药可培育三千棵山药苗，够一亩之用），明年就可繁殖二万八千亩。如以三分之二作种薯，亦可繁殖一万八、九千亩。
    俗话说：“一亩薯二亩谷”。上面所说的这一百四十万斤山药，如果能够有计划的掌握起来，那么在农业生产上和解决群众的食粮问题上，是有其很大的意义的。
　　二　怎样选留“种薯”
    甘薯换种的第一步工作，就是要预先选留“种薯”。在选择的时候，要注意下列几点：
    （１）选产量大的：那种山药收的多，就选那一种。
    （２）选具有本品种特性的（选叶形、蔓子、块形、颜色一样的）。
    （３）要尽量选麦茬的，因为麦茬山药块子整齐，出苗子多，传染病较少。
    （４）要选在霜前刨的，因为在霜前收的，不易腐烂，便于贮藏。
  　（５）选没有破伤，没有虫鼠咬伤及没有病害的。
    （６）选不大不小的山药块，因为块子大了浪费，块子小了苗秧不壮。
    “种薯”选出以后，就要小心保存，尽量的少吃少卖，并且不要做粉，以备交换，使农民群众在明年能够普遍的栽种。
　　三　提倡换种办法
    上面曾经说过，今年所产洋山药的数量已够在明年推广到二万来亩。但问题的关键，是如何把群众领导和组织起来，使其普遍的选留种薯，并确切的掌握使群众自觉的广泛的展开换种运动，目前山药已陆续收获，各级政府及生产领导机关应重视这一个工作。为此，我们在这里提出几点意见以供参考：
    （１）各村应发动农民互相换种。
    （２）在一个村子里如果种山药的很少，不够互换，可由村干负责组织起来，集体到种植洋山药较多的村子里去换。
    （３）由合作社收购，这是一个比较有力的办法，目前山药正在收获，各级合作社可到种洋山药较多的村子里收购，然后再有计划的分配卖给需要种薯的村子或农民。
    （４）互换的价格比例：普通以本地山药换者，每斤酌加四两上下。用米换者，按照石家庄专署各县常年的一般规律，山药刚下来的时候，每斤米可换五斤左右，春天山药缺少的时候，是每斤米换三斤左右，各地可依照群众习惯或双方议定的办法来互换。
    （５）现在订购春天运：为着避免过多的翻倒和创伤（如装车、卸车、入窑、出窑过多，容易坏）及运输过程中，山药受冻等影响，最好的办法是现在订好，明春再运。
