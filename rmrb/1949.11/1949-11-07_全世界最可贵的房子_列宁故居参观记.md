　　The Most Precious House in the World
  　A Visit to Lenin's Former Residence
    Wang Lin
    September 12th, the Moscow sun was particularly bright. At around nine o'clock in the morning, two large buses carrying comrades from the China Democratic Youth Cultural Troupe headed towards the suburbs. Upon arriving at Gorki Village, the Soviet comrade acting as translator pointed to a white house hidden in the forest, about half a kilometer away from the road, and told us: "That is the house where Lenin lived, the last house where Lenin lived!"
    "Ah! That is the last house where Lenin lived!"
    "Where is it? Where is it?"... Dozens of hearts beat in unison, dozens of eyes searched together, heading towards that most revered sacred place with boundless respect and enthusiasm.
    Passing through the tall, dense forest, we arrived at this great place, at this most precious house in the Soviet Union—not just the Soviet Union, but the entire world. After entering the gate, everyone put on felt shoes over their own shoes—this is the rule here, so that the dirt from outside does not contaminate this sacred place.
    Although there were dozens of people, it was as quiet as if no one was there—this wasn't just a rule, but the solemnity produced by everyone's love and respect for this great revolutionary leader. Holding our breath and keeping our mouths shut, we filed into Lenin's former residence.
    Before the revolution, this was the home of the widow of a famous Moscow factory owner, Morozov. In 1910, the widow married the mayor of Moscow. After the revolution, this house was nationalized. In 1918, Lenin was wounded in an assassination attempt by the Socialist-Revolutionary Party. Soon after, the doctor told him to come here to recuperate. But where could our leader, our mentor, find rest? He was injured, but he still continued to lead the revolution tirelessly. Look! Hanging on the wall is Lenin's certificate requesting the doctor's permission for him to participate in work, and a photo of "Lenin at Work," his right hand writing, his left hand still in a sling! It was here, under such circumstances, that Lenin completed his work "The Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade Kautsky."
    In the small telephone room stood a table, two or three chairs, and an old telephone hanging on the wall in front of the table. The female comrade acting as guide told us: "Comrades! Lenin sat on this chair, worked at this table. He never wanted to lose contact with the people. He often used this telephone to talk to Stalin, to dictate his articles. This is an old-fashioned telephone that often malfunctioned. Lenin asked for it to be repaired, and an amplifier was installed next to it to increase the volume."
    The guiding comrade pointed to a photo on the wall and said: "Comrades: Look at Lenin on the phone. Why is he wearing a winter coat? It turns out that in 1921 and 1922, Moscow was experiencing fuel shortages. In order to save fuel, Lenin lived in that small house outside, and wore his coat when he came over to use the telephone."
    Lenin liked children very much and often organized them to come here to play. Farmers also often came here to see their leader. In a room outside the telephone room, there is still a picture hanging of Lenin talking with farmers. On January 8, 1921, Lenin received representatives of farmers from Gorki here. The representatives asked Lenin to go to their village. The next day, Lenin and his wife rode horses to go. At a gathering of more than three hundred farmers, Lenin reported on the domestic and international situation at that time. After the meeting, the farmers asked Lenin to help them install electric lights and telephones in their village. In May, Gorki was connected to the power grid, and the village of Siyanova was also connected. The farmers of Siyanova Village held a celebration for their electrification and invited Lenin to attend. —The people's leader, is so closely linked with the people!
    The people loved Lenin so much, look at the gifts they gave to Lenin! A flag embroidered with a cross by female workers from the city of Tula, embroidered with the words "Wishing our father good health." A commemorative album sent by an orphanage, stationery sent by the employees of the Moscow Agricultural Exhibition in 1923, wooden carved tables and chairs sent by Ferga, samples of wheat brought by the Gorki Collective Farm when reporting to Lenin, a wax statue of Lenin given to Lenin's sister by workers after Lenin's death... How unique and exquisite these things are, these small things represent such lofty meanings!
    Lenin liked hunting. In addition to books, the library also displays the painting "Lenin Hunting in Gorki," binoculars, the machine for showing movies in this small house, deerskin shoes given by farmers, and the clothes Lenin wore. After seeing these clothes, everyone must marvel at the great simplicity of this people's leader!
    In the summer of 1923, Lenin often stayed in Gorki due to illness, and the doctor forbade him from working or receiving guests. In July, he felt a little better and took several pictures outside in the forest. One of them was a group photo with his wife, nephew, and niece. These photos are all hung in the library, as well as a photo taken with Stalin in Gorki in 1922. The canvas lounge chair where Lenin read books in the garden, as well as the wicker chair where Lenin sat, and the white painted chair where Stalin sat are all placed here. It was on these two small chairs that these two leaders of the working people of the world planned everything. These two small chairs are connected to the fate of the entire proletariat, and connected to the fate of all mankind.
    As we lightly stepped onto the stairs, the guiding comrade said: Comrades: Look, these stairs have two layers of handrails, so that Lenin could go up and down the stairs by himself without anyone's help. See how simple and plain our Lenin lived! How strictly he demanded of himself!
    Upstairs there are two terraces. Lenin and Stalin often talked on the left terrace. The right terrace was where Lenin received farmers in the summer of 1919.
    In the dining room, there is a long table with seven chairs around it. On the table are the cups and plates used by Lenin and a copper teapot. A clock and three paintings hang on the wall.
    Connected to the dining room is the office. The equipment was all originally used by the homeowner, and Lenin did not allow new furniture to be made. A desk is placed in a corner of the house, with a chair in front of it and many books on the desk. It was at this desk that Lenin wrote works such as "Once Again on the Trade Unions" and "The Crisis of the Party." The office is relatively spacious, and the bed of his wife, Krupskaya, is placed in a corner of the room, separated by a screen. Next to this bed is a door. We went out of this door and came to Lenin's small bedroom. In a corner of the bedroom, against the wall, is a single bed, covered with plain white sheets. His cane and medicine are placed here. A very short square table is where Lenin read books. There are two chairs in front of the table, one of which is for his wife to sit on. Lenin's favorite books, "My Universities" and "Love and Life," are also placed on the table. He read them two days before his death.
    In the winter of 1923, Lenin's illness improved, and the doctor said he could return to Moscow to work. But, who would have thought, who would have thought: On January 21, 1924, the great Lenin suddenly suffered a cerebral hemorrhage, and at 6:50, on this simple small bed, this revolutionary giant, the mentor of progressive mankind throughout the world, passed away. The guiding comrade said: "Comrades! If he hadn't been injured in 1918, our leader could have lived for decades longer!"
    How hateful! If he hadn't been poisoned by counter-revolutionaries, our leader could have lived for decades longer! We “hummed” angrily and, with tears of grief, stepped into the adjacent room, which was originally the place where the remains were placed. Now, the mentor's portrait, carved by Mirgolov, is lifelike, surrounded by red flags, and surrounded by wreaths and elegiac couplets sent by the farmers. This is where human righteousness lies, this great portrait will shine as brightly as the sun forever! Forever!
    On the left wall, Comrade Stalin's maxim shines upon this group of Chinese youth: "Remember, love, study our Lenin, he is our mentor, he is our leader." Most respected mentor, Comrade Lenin! We will always remember you, love you, and study you! Today, under the wise leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese people have been liberated. We will always be grateful to you! Thank you for your guidance!

　　全世界最可贵的房子
  　列宁故居参观记
    王琳
    九月十二日，莫斯科的太阳特别光彩。上午九点来钟，两辆大汽车载着我们中国民主青年文工团的同志们向郊外前进。到了哥尔基村，担任翻译的苏联同志就指着离马路一里来远的一所隐蔽在森林里的白色洋房告诉我们：“那就是列宁住的房子，列宁最后住的房子！”
    “啊！那就是列宁最后住的房子！”
    “在哪里？在哪里？”……几十颗心一致在跳动，几十双眼睛一致在寻找，怀着无比的尊敬和热情向着那最令人景仰的圣地。
    穿过高大茂密的森林，我们来到这伟大的所在，来到这苏联——不止苏联，全世界最可贵的房子。进了大门，每个人都在自己的鞋上套上一双毡鞋——这是这里的规矩，不能叫外面的肮脏沾污了这圣洁的地方。
    虽然是几十个人，却静悄悄的象没有人一样——这不是什么规矩，而是每个人对这伟大的革命领袖的爱戴和敬仰所产生肃穆。屏着气，闭着嘴，我们鱼贯走进了列宁的故居。
    革命前，这是莫斯科一个有名厂主莫洛左夫的寡妇的家，一九一○年这寡妇和莫斯科市长结了婚，革命后，这房子收归国有了。一九一八年，列宁被社会革命党阴谋刺伤，不久，医生叫他来这里休养。但是，我们的领袖，我们的导师哪里肯休息呢？他受伤了，他依旧继续不断地领导革命。看呵！那墙上正挂着列宁请求医生许可他参加工作的证件，挂着“列宁在工作中”的相片，右手在写字，左手还吊着绑带呢！就在这里，就在这样的情况下，列宁完成了他的“无产阶级革命与叛徒考茨基”这一著作。
    小小的电话室里摆着一张桌子，两三把椅子，桌前墙上挂着一付古老的电话。向导的女同志对我们说：“同志们！列宁就在这椅子上坐，在这桌子上工作。他一刻也不愿和人民失去连系，他经常用这电话和斯大林谈话，用这电话口述他的文章。这是个旧式电话，经常出毛病，列宁要求把它修好，在旁边做了个扩音机加大声音。”
    向导同志又指着墙上的一张照片说：“同志们：你们看列宁在打电话。他为什么穿着冬大衣呢？原来一九二一，二二年莫斯科的燃料困难，列宁为了节省燃料，住在外面那所小房子里，打电话时穿着大衣过来。”
    列宁很喜欢小孩，经常组织小孩到这里来玩。农民们也经常来这里看望他们的领袖，电话室外面的一间屋里，还挂着列宁和农民谈话的像片。一九二一年一月八日，列宁在这里接见了哥尔基的农民代表，代表们要求列宁到他们村里去。第二天，列宁和夫人就骑着马去了。在三百多个农民的集会上，列宁报告了当时国内外的形势。会后，农民要求列宁帮助他们村里安设电灯电话。五月，哥尔基就接上电线，西雅诺娃村也接上了。西雅诺娃村的农民为他们的电气化开了一个庆祝会，请列宁去参加。——人民的领袖，是这样紧密地和人民连在一起！
    人民是这样的爱列宁，看看他们送给列宁的礼物吧！杜拉城的女工用十字布绣的旗子，上面绣着“祝我们的父亲健康”。孤儿院送的纪念册，一九二三年莫斯科农业展览会的职工们送的文具，费尔加送的木雕桌椅，哥尔基集体农场向列宁做报告送来的麦子样品，列宁死后工人送给列宁姐姐的列宁腊像……。这些东西多么别致精巧，这些小小的东西，代表着多么崇高的意义！
    列宁喜欢打猎，图书室里除书籍外，还陈列着“列宁在哥尔基打猎”的画，望远镜，在这小屋里放电影的机器，农民送的鹿皮鞋，以及列宁穿过的衣服。看了这衣服，谁也得惊叹这人民领袖的伟大的朴素！
    一九二三年夏天，列宁因病常住哥尔基，医生禁止他工作，会客。七月间，他好了一点，在外边森林里照了几张像。其中一张是和他的夫人、侄子侄女合照的，这些像都挂在图书室里，还有一九二二年和斯大林在哥尔基一起照的像片。列宁在花园里看书时的帆布躺椅，以及列宁坐的藤椅，斯大林坐的白漆椅都摆在这里，就在这两张小小的椅子上，这两位全世界劳动人民的领袖策划着一切，这两张小小的椅子连系着整个无产阶级的命运，连系着全人类的命运。
    当我们轻轻地踏上楼梯的时候，向导同志说：同志们：你们看这楼梯有两层扶手，这样，列宁可以不要人帮助，自己上下楼。看我们的列宁生活得多么简单朴素！他多么严格的要求自己！
    楼上有两个露台，列宁和斯大林常在左边露台上谈话。右边露台，是一九一九年夏天列宁接见农民的地方。
    食堂里摆着一张长桌子，七把椅子围着它。桌上有列宁用的杯盘和一把铜茶壶。墙上挂着一架钟，三幅画。
    和食堂相连的是办公室，设备都是房主原用的，列宁不让制新家具。房子的一角摆着写字台，台前一把椅子，台上放着许多书。在这写字台上，列宁写了“再论职工会”，“党的危机”等著作。办公室比较宽敞，夫人克鲁普斯卡雅的床就摆在室的一角，用屏风隔离起来。这床旁边就是一道门，我们出了这道门，来到列宁的小小的卧室里。卧室的一角，靠墙摆着一张单人床，铺着朴素的白布单子，他用的手杖，药品都摆在这里。一张很矮小的方桌，是列宁看书的地方。桌前两把椅子，其中一把是夫人坐的。桌上还摆着列宁最喜欢的“我的大学”，和“爱与生活”，他逝世前两天还看过它们。
    一九二三年冬天，列宁的病好了，医生说他可以回莫斯科工作了。但是，谁想到，谁想到呵：一九二四年一月二十一日，伟大的列宁突然得了脑冲血，六点五十分，在这张朴素的小床上，这革命的巨人，全世界进步人类的导师便与世长辞了。向导同志说：“同志们！要不是一九一八年受了伤，我们的领袖还可以多活几十年呢！”
    可恨呵！要不是遭了反革命的毒手，我们的领袖还可以多活几十年！我们狠狠的“哼”了一声，含着悲愤的泪跨进隔壁一间屋里，这是原来停放遗体的地方。现在，两杆红旗簇拥着米尔哥洛夫雕刻的导师遗像栩栩如生，这遗像被农民们送来的花圈挽联围绕着。这是人类正气之所在，这伟大的遗像将与太阳一起灿烂到永远！永远！
    左边墙上，斯大林同志的箴言在向我们这一群中国青年闪着光辉：“记着，爱，研究我们的列宁，他是我们的导师，他是我们的领袖。”最敬爱的导师列宁同志！我们将永远记着你，爱你，研究你！今天，在毛泽东同志的英明领导下，中国人民已经翻身了。我们永远感谢着你！感谢着你的指导！
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　一九四九、十一、四。
