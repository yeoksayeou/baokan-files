    Section 2: From Bourgeois Political Economy to Marxist-Leninist Political Economy
    Marx and *Das Kapital*, and Marxist Political Economy
    Marxist political economy, later with the development of capitalism, the unity of the proletariat, the intensification of the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and the growth of the proletariat's strength, continued to develop. Marxist political economy, or proletarian political economy, as its name proclaims, stands on the proletariat's position, uses the proletariat's viewpoint (that is, the viewpoint of dialectical materialism), the method of materialist dialectics, and the scientific historical view (historical materialism) to observe and analyze the economy of capitalist society, explore the laws of capitalist economic movement, and criticize capitalist society and bourgeois political economy from the economic aspect. Its famous and outstanding masterpiece is Marx's *Das Kapital*.
    The subtitle of *Das Kapital* is "Critique of Political Economy," in which a scientific and profound dissection and analysis of the capitalist economy is made, elucidating the laws of capitalist economic movement, explaining how the capitalist economy arises, is established, develops, and finally inevitably heads towards death, to be replaced by a higher-level economy—the socialist economy. Marx only completed the first volume of *Das Kapital* during his lifetime. The second and third volumes were only in draft form and were published by Engels after Marx's death. These three volumes of *Das Kapital*, a vast masterpiece, laid a solid and unshakeable theoretical foundation for Marxist political economy and the entire Marxist doctrine. However, its content, from an economic point of view, only includes the basic analysis of the capitalist economy, that is, only the analysis of the laws of capitalist economic movement. As for some other more specific and complex phenomena in capitalist society, such as the role of the state in the economy, international trade, the world market, economic panics, etc., these also formed part of Marx's political economy research plan, but he was unable to complete them in time. Besides the analysis of capitalist social economy in *Das Kapital*, Marx also has the famous *Theories of Surplus Value*, which is a critique of capitalist economic theories. Due to all these, proletarian political economy is called Marx's political economy or Marxist political economy because of Marx's creation.
    Lenin and *Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism*, and Marxist-Leninist Political Economy
    Marx lived during the period of capitalist development and could only observe and analyze the economic situation of his time. He could only make predictions about the trends of capitalist development to a certain extent. It was not until before Engels' death that he saw some characteristics of imperialism—that is, the period of monopoly capitalism. Subsequently, capitalism developed to a higher, that is, the final stage of imperialism. The dissection and analysis of economic phenomena during the imperialist period, and the analysis and elucidation of the laws governing the economic movement during the imperialist period, are found in Lenin's *Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism*. Although this book is not as vast a masterpiece as Marx's *Das Kapital*, it is only a small booklet, but the issues it explains are more extensive than the scope of *Das Kapital*. Therefore, *Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism*, theoretically speaking, is a continuation and development of Marxist political economy. Like *Das Kapital*, it analyzes and criticizes the capitalist economy, and it has become not only an important theoretical weapon for the proletariat's struggle against the bourgeoisie, but also a guide to action for the world's proletarian revolution and the liberation struggles of colonies and semi-colonies. Precisely because of these reasons, Marxist political economy, or proletarian political economy, developed to Lenin's stage and became Marxist-Leninist political economy, referred to as Marxist-Leninist political economy.
    Stalin and Socialist Construction, and Marxist-Leninist Political Economy
    After the victory of the October Socialist Revolution in the Soviet Union, the first socialist country appeared on one-sixth of the world's land, with the establishment and development of a socialist economy. Initially, there was Lenin's theoretical analysis of the socialist economy and instructions on the principles and policies of socialist economic construction. After Lenin's death, Comrade Stalin inherited his cause, and he further developed the economic theory of socialism and the guidance of socialist economic construction. The establishment and development of socialist economic construction is a further and more advanced development of Marxist-Leninist political economy. This theory has become not only a weapon for the international proletariat's struggle against the bourgeoisie and socialist revolutionary action, but also a guiding principle and guiding policy for socialist economic construction, and a weapon for criticizing erroneous views on socialist economic construction, becoming the theoretical basis for the Soviet Union's socialist economic construction for more than 30 years, the various planned economies, and the war-time economy and victory during the Great Patriotic War.
    Mao Zedong and New Democratic Economic Construction, and Marxist-Leninist Political Economy
    In new democratic countries, especially in semi-colonial and semi-feudal China, under the leadership of the Chinese working class, after more than 20 years of long and brutal revolutionary struggle, the Soviet areas of the Land Revolution, the anti-Japanese democratic base areas during the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the later People's Liberation Areas were established. Recently, the New Democratic People's Republic was also established. At the same time, in this long revolutionary struggle, the basic principles and basic theories of the new democratic economy emerged. These basic principles and basic theories are represented by the works of the people's leader, Comrade Mao Zedong. Comrade Mao Zedong's works include, first, the part on the new democratic economy in *On New Democracy*, then the monographs *On Financial and Economic Problems*, and then the essays *On Cooperatives*, *Get Organized*, *Completely Learn Economic Work in Two or Three Years*, and the part on economic programs in *On Coalition Government* and *The Present Situation and Our Tasks*, and other essays. They are all a brilliant and outstanding application of the universal truth of Marxist-Leninist political economy in the practice of the Chinese revolution. They are the result of the combination of the universal truth of Marxist-Leninist political economy and the practice of the Chinese revolution, and are even more enriched and developed. The economic policy section of the Common Program adopted by the First Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is also a summary of the practical experience of economic construction in the liberated areas under the guidance of Comrade Mao Zedong's economic thought in the current stage of the Chinese revolution. Its principlization and systematization is the guiding light and policy for the economic construction of the new China in the current period. All these, on the one hand, are weapons for the Chinese people to fight against the enemies of the Chinese revolution—imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and on the other hand, they are the basis for the line, principles, and policies of the new democratic economic construction of the People's Republic of China, and they are all manifested in the form of this line, principles, and policies. That is to say: The line, principles, and policies of new democratic economic construction concretely embody the viewpoints and theories of the new democratic economy. And this new democratic economic viewpoint and economic theory are the concrete embodiment and development of Marxist-Leninist political economy in China. The new democratic economy and the new democratic economic theory are established and developed in the process of theory turning into practice, promoting practice, and then observing and analyzing practice, and summarizing the experience of practical work, raising it to the height of principles and the height of theory—in this process of interaction between theory and practice.

　　政治经济学教程绪论（３１）
　　政治经济学的研究对象任务及其特点
  　　　　　第三章　政治经济学的任务意义与中国革命
    第二节　由资产阶级的政治经济学到马列主义的政治经济学
    马克思及其资本论，与马克思主义政治经济学
    马克思主义的政治经济学，以后随着资本主义的发展，无产阶级的团结，无产阶级与资产阶级斗争的尖锐化，无产阶级力量的增长，也继续发展起来。马克思主义的政治经济学或无产阶级的政治经济学正如它的名字所宣示的，它是站在无产阶级的立场上，运用无产阶级的观点（即辩证唯物论的观点），唯物辩证法的方法与科学的历史观（唯物史观），对资本主义社会的经济，加以观察分析，探求资本主义经济运动的规律，并从经济方面批判了资本主义社会，批判了资产阶级政治经济学，其有名的杰出的巨著，就是马克思的资本论。
    资本论的副题又叫做政治经济学批判，其中对资本主义的经济作了科学的深刻的解剖与分析，阐发资本主义经济运动的规律，说明了资本主义经济怎样由发生，成立，到发展以至最后必然走向死亡，由一个高级的经济——社会主义经济来代替。马克思生前只完成了资本论第一卷，第二、第三两卷都只是草稿的形式，都是于马克思逝世后经恩格斯整理出版的。资本论这三卷浩大的巨著，奠定了马克思主义政治经济学与马克思主义整个学说的坚固不拔的理论基础，但是它所包括的内容，从经济上说来，还只包括对资本主义经济基本的分析，即只是对资本主义经济运动的规律的分析，至于对资本主义社会其他某些更具体的复杂的现象，在国家对于经济的作用，国际贸易，世界市场，经济恐慌等等问题，本也形成着马克思政治经济学研究计划的一部份，但是没有能够来得及完成。马克思除了资本论这部巨著对资本主义社会经济的分析以外，还有著名的剩余价值学说史，是对资本主义经济学说的批判。由此种种，无产阶级政治经济学由于马克思的创造，因此我们叫它为马克思的政治经济学，或者马克思主义的政治经济学。
    列宁及其帝国主义论与马列主义政治经济学
    马克思生长在资本主义发展的时期，只能观察分析他当时的经济状况。对资本主义发展的趋向，只能做到某种程度的预言。迨至恩格斯逝世前，才看到帝国主义——即独占资本主义时期的某些特征，随后资本主义发展到更高级的，也就是最后阶段的帝国主义时期。对于帝国主义时期经济现象的解剖分析，和对支配帝国主义时期经济运动底规律的分析和阐发，是有列宁的帝国主义论，即最高阶段底资本主义一书。此书虽不是象马克思的资本论那样浩大的巨著，而只是一本小册子，但是它所说明的问题却要比资本论的范围更加广泛些。所以帝国主义论，从理论上说来，是马克思主义政治经济学的继续发展。它与资本论同样都是分析与批判资本主义的经济，不但成为无产阶级对资产阶级斗争重要的理论武器，而且也是世界无产阶级革命与殖民地半殖民地解放斗争的行动指针。正由于这些缘故，所以马克思主义政治经济学或无产阶级政治经济学发展到了列宁的阶段，便发展成为做马克思列宁主义的政治经济学，简称为马列主义政治经济学。
    斯大林及社会主义建设，与马列主义政治经济学
    在苏联十月社会主义革命胜利以后，在全世界六分之一的土地上，出现了第一个社会主义的国家，有社会主义经济的建立与发展。最初有列宁对于社会主义经济的理论的分析，和社会主义经济建设的方针政策的指示。列宁逝世以后，继承他的事业的有斯大林同志，他对社会主义的经济理论与社会主义经济建设的指导，都有更进一步的发展。社会主义经济建设的成立和发展，是马列主义政治经济学更进一步的更高级的发展，这种理论不但成为对国际资产阶级斗争与社会主义革命行动的武器，同时又是社会主义经济建设的指导原理指导方针，批判有关社会主义经济建设的错误观点的武器，成为苏联三十余年来社会主义经济建设，历次计划经济与卫国战争时期、战时经济与胜利的理论根据。
    毛泽东及新民主主义经济建设与马列主义政治经济学
    在新民主主义国家里，特别是半殖民地半封建的中国，在中国工人阶级领导下，经过二十余年来长期残酷的革命斗争，成立了土地革命的苏维埃地区，抗日战争时期的抗日民主根据地和以后的人民解放区，最近又有新民主主义人民共和国的成立。同时也就在这长期的革命斗争过程中，出现了新民主主义经济的基本方针和基本理论。这些基本方针与基本理论，都以人民领袖毛泽东同志的著作为代表出现着。毛泽东同志的著作最早有新民主主义论中关于新民主主义的经济部份，后有财政问题与经济问题的专著，再后又有论合作社、组织起来、两三年内完全学会经济工作、论联合政府与目前形势和我们的任务中关于经济纲领部份等等论著。它们都是马列主义政治经济学的普遍真理，在中国革命实践过程中天才的杰出的运用，是马列主义政治经济学的普遍真理与中国革命实践相结合，并且更加充实发展的结果。最近第一届人民政治协商会议通过的共同纲领中关于经济政策部份，也是现阶段中国革命过程中毛泽东同志经济思想指导下解放区经济建设工作实际经验的总结，其原则化和系统化，是目前时期新中国经济建设的指路南针和政策。所有这些，一方面是中国人民反对中国革命敌人——帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义理论斗争的武器，同时又是中华人民共和国新民主主义经济建设路线、方针和政策的根据，并且它们又都是以这种路线方针政策的形式表现出来。这也就是说：新民主主义经济建设的路线、方针和政策具体地体现着新民主主义经济的观点和理论。而这种新民主主义的经济观点与经济理论，又是马列主义政治经济学在中国的具体体现和发展。新民主主义的经济与新民主主义的经济理论，就是理论变成实际，推动实际，而又观察分析实际，总结实际工作的经验，把它提高到原则的高度，理论的高度——这样理论与实际交互作用过程中建立和发展起来的。
