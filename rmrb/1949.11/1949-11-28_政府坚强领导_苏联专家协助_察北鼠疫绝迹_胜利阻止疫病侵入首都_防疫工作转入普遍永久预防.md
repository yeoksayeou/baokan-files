　　Strong Government Leadership · Soviet Experts Assist
  　Chabei Plague Eradicated
    Successfully Preventing Epidemic from Entering the Capital
    Epidemic Prevention Work Turns to Universal Permanent Prevention
    [Our News] Under the unified leadership of the Central Epidemic Prevention Committee, the Chabei plague has been definitively defeated. For more than twenty days since the 4th of this month, no more plague patients have been discovered. The epidemic prevention personnel remaining in Chabei and Zhangjiakou are continuing to carry out preventive injections, rat and flea extermination, and disinfection work in the epidemic area, further exploring the source of the plague, in the hope of completely eradicating it. This time, the plague in Chahar Province originated in Chahan Beng Beng, Kangbao County, and spread to Baoyuan County at the end of October, and to the vicinity of Zhangjiakou and Jining in Suiyuan Province in early November. In just over half a month, it spread more than 300 miles. After learning of the epidemic, the Chahar Provincial Government immediately reported to the higher authorities and discussed emergency epidemic prevention measures. The Provincial Chairman Zhang Su personally went to the epidemic area to arrange the work. After receiving the report on November 26, the State Council of the Central People's Government held an emergency meeting to organize the Central Epidemic Prevention Committee, which officially started work on the 28th; immediately mobilized the Party, government, army, and people to carry out epidemic prevention blockade, cutting off the traffic on the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway from Datong to Nankou; designated the Dalian and Changchun Health Experimental Institutes and the Beijing Temple of Heaven Epidemic Prevention Department to rush to produce vaccines; and at the same time telegraphed the Soviet government for assistance with 4 million doses of live bacteria vaccine; and decided to widely carry out epidemic prevention propaganda through newspapers, radio stations, and movies. It also rushed to transfer epidemic prevention personnel from various places to form an epidemic prevention general team of 727 people, including medical personnel from the Health Department of the Central Military Commission, the Northeast Epidemic Prevention Team, the Inner Mongolia Epidemic Prevention Team, the North China Epidemic Prevention Team, the North China Health School, the North China People's Hospital, the Health Institute of the Hebei Provincial Government, the Health Department of the Hebei Military Region, medical cadres and students from schools and institutions such as the Beijing National First Midwifery School, and veterinary doctors from Fengtai Veterinary School. Soviet medical expert Dr. Rogozin and four other Soviet experts and a Soviet epidemic prevention team of 32 people, at the invitation of the Central Epidemic Prevention Committee, also rushed to Beijing on the night of November 4 and the morning of November 5, and arrived in Zhangjiakou on the evening of the 5th to cooperate in prevention and treatment work. The Central Epidemic Prevention Committee has successively issued more than 3.81 million doses of vaccines, including more than 1.31 million doses of live bacteria vaccine, 2.49 million doses of killed bacteria vaccine, as well as a large number of methylene blue, sulfa drugs, disinfectants, penicillin, DDT and other drugs, which were distributed to Chahar Province and Beijing, Tianjin and other places for use. After the three epidemic prevention teams arrived in Zhangjiakou, the first and second teams successively went deep into the Chabei epidemic area to work. Soviet expert Dr. Rogozin and Maisky, the chief representative of the Soviet epidemic prevention team, personally went to Chahan Beng Beng, Longwangmiao and other epidemic areas to conduct on-the-spot investigation and research. The third epidemic prevention team, with the assistance of the Soviet epidemic prevention team, carried out work in Zhangjiakou City and the Jijiabafangzi Village in the suburbs, and some epidemic prevention team members went to work in Jining, Datong and other areas. Thanks to the active prevention and treatment of the three epidemic prevention teams and the Soviet epidemic prevention team, and the assistance and cooperation of Chahar Province medical personnel and local cadres, the plague was quickly defeated.
