Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 24th—TASS, Moscow: A group of participants in the International Democratic Women's Federation Council meeting left Moscow on the 23rd for Beijing to attend the upcoming Asian Women's Representative Conference. This included representatives from China, India, Mongolia, Korea, Indonesia, and other countries, headed by Madame Vaillant-Couturier.

They were seen off at the station by cadres of the Soviet Women's Anti-Fascist Committee, representatives who remained in Moscow as guests of the Soviet Women's Anti-Fascist Committee after attending the International Democratic Women's Federation Council meeting, as well as representatives from various circles and the press.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 24th—Marian Ramelson, an active worker in the British labor movement, and Charlotta Bass, the African-American publisher and editor of the American black weekly "California Eagle," have been selected as the British and American representatives to attend the Asian Women's Representative Conference.

According to the London Daily Worker, Mrs. Ramelson "carries hundreds of telegrams, letters, and greetings from all over Britain to the women of India, the women of Malaya, and especially to the women of China."

The New York Daily Worker reported that Mrs. Bass is one of the four American representatives attending the Asian Women's Representative Conference, selected by the Congress of American Women from the western United States as its representative.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 24th—TASS, Moscow: The editorial department of the magazine "Soviet Woman" organized a press conference for journalists from various countries on the 22nd for the International Democratic Women's Federation Council meeting. Madame Vaillant-Couturier, Secretary-General of the International Democratic Women's Federation, reported on the achievements of the International Democratic Women's Federation meeting. She said that the meeting had passed a resolution calling on women around the world to participate vigorously in the World Peace Congress. She also said that the Council had unanimously approved the Executive Committee's decision to expel the leaders of the current Yugoslav Women's Front from the leadership bodies of the International Democratic Women's Federation, in order to accommodate those Yugoslav women who remain loyal to the camp of peace and democracy in the leadership bodies of the Federation.

Soviet and foreign journalists raised a number of questions, which were answered by Vaillant-Couturier, Elisabeth Millar (USA), Doris Nielsen (Canada), Giulietta Fibbi (Italy), and others. In answering a question about the struggle for equal pay for equal work for men and women, Mrs. Millar stated that the International Democratic Women's Federation was taking action on this issue in conjunction with the World Federation of Trade Unions. The Federation had submitted a proposal on this issue to the United Nations Economic and Social Council, but the Economic and Social Council submitted it to the International Labor Organization without consideration. The latter is now also refusing to discuss the issue and is postponing it until next year. Mrs. Millar stated: Our Federation will continue to firmly insist that this issue must be discussed and resolved.

    【新华社北京二十四日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：国际民主妇联理事会会议与会者一行多人，已于二十三日离莫斯科前往北京，参加即将召开的亚洲妇女代表会议。内有以瓦伦特——古久里夫人为首的中国、印度、蒙古、朝鲜、印尼以及其他国家的代表。
    赴车站送行者有苏联妇女反法西斯委员会的干部、参加国际民主妇联理事会会议后作为苏联妇女反法西斯委员会的嘉宾留在莫斯科的代表们，以及各界代表与新闻界的代表。
    【新华社布拉格二十四日电】英国工人运动的积极工作者玛利安·拉麦尔逊夫人，和美国的黑人周刊“加利福尼亚之鹰”的发行人女黑人出版家察尔洛达·巴斯夫人，已被选派为英国和美国出席亚洲妇女代表会议的代表。
    据伦敦工人日报消息：拉麦尔逊夫人“携有英国各地致印度妇女、马来亚妇女，特别是致中国妇女的数百封电报、信件和贺词”。
    纽约工人日报报道：巴斯夫人是出席亚洲妇女代表会议的四名美国代表之一，由美国妇女大会从美国西部选派作为该会的代表。
    【新华社北京二十四日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：“苏联妇女”杂志编辑部于二十二日为国际民主妇联理事会会议组织了一个各国记者招待会。国际民主妇联总书记瓦伦特——古久里夫人向招待会作了国际民主妇联会议成果的报告。她说：会议已通过决议，号召全世界妇女有力地参加世界拥护和平大会她又说，理事会已一致批准执委会关于将现时南斯拉夫妇女阵线的领袖驱逐出国际民主妇联领导机构的决定，以便在妇联领导机构中容纳那些仍然忠于和平与民主阵营的南斯拉夫妇女。
    苏联记者和外国记者提出了若干问题，由瓦伦特——古久里、伊利萨伯·米拉尔德（美）、多利斯·尼尔逊（加）、裘列塔·菲比（意）等分别作答。在答复关于争取男女同工同酬的斗争的问题时，米拉尔德夫人声称：国际民主妇联在这一问题上是与世界工联取得联系后采取行动的。妇联曾向联合国经社理事会提出了关于这一问题的建议，然而，经社理事会竟不加考虑而提交国际劳工组织。后者现在也拒绝讨论这一问题，并将之推延到明年。米拉尔德夫人声称：我们妇联将继续坚决主张这一问题必须加以讨论和解决。
