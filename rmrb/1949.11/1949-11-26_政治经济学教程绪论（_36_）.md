　　The Object of Study, Tasks, and Characteristics of Political Economy
  　Chapter 3: The Tasks and Significance of Political Economy and the Chinese Revolution
    Section 3: Marxist-Leninist Political Economy and the Chinese Revolution
    In the work of mobilizing and organizing the masses, it is first necessary in the cities to constantly understand and be familiar with the lives and status of the working class, as well as their demands and voices, and to improve their lives. At the same time, it is necessary to understand the situation and dynamics of the bourgeoisie, and to understand and be familiar with the relationship between the bourgeoisie and the working class, as well as the relationship between the working class and other working people. In accordance with the principle of benefiting both labor and capital, all disputes between labor and capital should be handled. In the countryside, on the one hand, it is necessary to understand the situation of the peasant class, mainly the poor peasants, hired peasants and middle peasants, and on the other hand, it is necessary to understand the situation of the landlord class and the rich peasant class, to understand the relationship between the feudal and semi-feudal classes and the peasant class, the relationship within the peasant class, and the relationship between the peasant class and other working people such as workers and handicraftsmen. Understanding these situations is extremely important whether in the new district after the counter-revolutionary forces have been overthrown, carrying out rent reduction and interest rate reduction movements, or further implementing land reform after rent reduction and interest rate reduction, or after rent reduction and interest rate reduction and land reform have been completed, shifting to the production movement and organizing and leading the restoration and development of agricultural production. However, to deeply understand these situations, it is not possible without a certain knowledge of political economy and combining it with the concrete objective reality of the revolution.
    Political Economy and Revolutionary Cultural and Educational Work

    All culture and art are the creation and crystallization of human labor, one of the superstructures of society, and are used to serve the improvement and elevation of human life and to promote and advance the development of social productive forces. Therefore, the new democratic cultural work must reflect the various realistic practical struggles in the people's democratic revolutionary cause, and must truthfully and vividly reflect the people's lives and the various deeds of national economic construction. Especially after the victory of the revolution, all cultural and educational work should revolve around the central task of production and construction, and serve this central task. To do this work well, it is bound to be done poorly without knowledge of political economy. Since Comrade Mao Zedong put forward the direction of literature and art serving the workers, peasants and soldiers at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art, in recent years, we have had some excellent works on military struggles, economic struggles and economic construction, which are loved by the workers, peasants and soldiers and have played a great educational role for the people. In the future, we must continue to adhere to and better realize this direction, and with the arrival of a high tide of national economic construction, a high tide of cultural and educational work will be set off. Whether in literature and art, in social sciences, or in natural sciences, there will be more and more excellent Marxist-Leninist works loved by the working people.
    In the new era, Marxist-Leninist political economy should become an important required course in education at all levels, in order to improve the theoretical level of Marxism-Leninism of general cadres, especially their accomplishment in political economy, to cultivate a large number of revolutionary intellectuals who have genuine Marxist-Leninist political economy knowledge and can combine it with practice to undertake theoretical struggles and guide practical actions. Training a large number of financial and economic work cadres who have both theory and can link with practice, master policies, understand business and master technology has also become an urgent and serious task in the final victory stage of the new democratic revolution today.
    Political Economy and Revolutionary Party Affairs

    The task of Marxist-Leninist theory is to expound the laws of social development and enable the working class party to lead the working class and other working people to carry out revolutionary struggles, transform society, transform the world, and transform mankind in accordance with these laws. However, "the key to studying the laws of social history is not to seek in people's minds, in social views and ideas, but to seek in the mode of production adopted by society in each certain historical period, that is, to seek in society's economy." (A Short History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Chapter Four, Section 2). Therefore, Comrade Stalin also taught us: "If the proletarian party wants to become a real party, it should first be proficient in the laws of production development and the laws of socio-economic development." "In order to avoid making mistakes in politics, the proletarian party should first proceed from the laws of production development and the laws of socio-economic development when formulating its own program and carrying out practical activities." (Ibid.) The above requires us to seek the laws of social development from the mode of production, from the social economy, requires us to be proficient in the laws of production development, proficient in the laws of social and economic development, and requires us to grasp the party's program and policies in accordance with these laws, which requires us to study Marxist-Leninist political economy, be proficient in Marxist-Leninist political economy, and closely combine Marxist-Leninist political economy with the objective revolutionary reality. Therefore, for the entire proletariat, the working class party—the Communist Party—Marxist-Leninist political economy is an indispensable weapon for the party's program, line, principles and policies and practical actions to be determined and to proceed from. For every Communist Party member, it is the foundation on which their revolutionary worldview and outlook on life, that is, the entire revolutionary worldview, is established. Therefore, the education and study of Marxist-Leninist political economy has become an absolutely indispensable part of the party's education and intra-party education, and should be valued by every Communist Party member and every revolutionary fighter. As far as the leadership of the working class party over the work of the government is concerned, it cannot be separated from Marxist-Leninist political economy as a fighting weapon. The People's Republic of China is a country led by the vanguard of the Chinese working class—the Communist Party of China. All military, political, economic, mass movement, cultural and educational, diplomatic, judicial, and public security government work must be carried out under the leadership of the Communist Party, and the embodiment and exertion of this leadership or leadership role is completely inseparable from the fighting weapon of the science of Marxist-Leninist political economy. For example, the establishment and implementation of the party's united front policy, the establishment, implementation and inspection of a series of financial and economic policies such as the party's land policy, industrial and commercial policy, trade policy, monetary and financial policy, and fiscal and tax policy, would not be possible without the theoretical knowledge of Marxist-Leninist political economy. Taking only the division and evaluation of the class composition and origin of party members and cadres in the party's organizational work, it is also necessary to have rich knowledge in this area, otherwise deviations will occur.

　　政治经济学的研究对象任务及其特点
  　第三章　政治经济学的任务意义与中国革命
    第三节　马列主义政治经济学与中国革命
    在发动与组织群众工作中，在城市中首先必须经常了解熟悉工人阶级的生活与地位，以及他们的要求和呼声，改善他们的生活，同时必须了解资产阶级的情况和动态，了解与熟悉资产阶级与工人阶级相互间的关系，以及工人阶级与其他劳动人民的关系。按照劳资两利的原则，处理劳资间所发生的一切纠纷。在乡村中一方面需要了解农民阶级主要是贫雇农与中农的情况，另一方面必须了解地主阶级与富农阶层的状况，了解封建与半封建阶级与农民阶级的关系，农民阶级内部的关系，以及农民阶级与其他劳动人民如工人、手工业者等各方面的关系。这些情况的了解不论在新区在反革命势力被推翻以后，进行减租减息运动，或者在减租减息以后进一步实行土地改革工作中，或者在减租减息与土地改革完成后，转入生产运动，组织与领导恢复与发展农业生产，都是极其重要的。但是要深刻的了解这些情况，如果没有一定的政治经济学知识，并把它与具体的革命的客观实际结合起来，是不行的。
    政治经济学与革命的文化教育工作　
    一切文化艺术都是人类劳动的创造、结晶，是社会的上层建筑之一，并用以服务于人类生活的改善提高，推动与促进社会生产力的发展。故新民主主义的文化工作，必须反映人民民主革命事业中各种现实的实践斗争，必须真实生动地反映人民生活，国家经济建设的各种事迹，尤其在革命胜利以后，一切文化教育工作都应当围绕了生产建设这一中心工作，并为这一中心工作而服务。要做好这一工作，如果没有政治经济学的知识，也必然会做不好的。自从毛泽东同志在延安文艺座谈会上提出文艺为工农兵服务的方向以后，近几年来，我们已经有了某些关于军事斗争、经济斗争与经济建设的优秀作品，为工农兵大众所爱戴，并对人民起了很大的教育作用。今后还要继续坚持贯彻这一方向的更好的实现，随着全国经济建设高潮的到来，掀起一个文化教育工作的高潮，不论在文艺上，在社会科学上，以及在自然科学上，将有更多更为劳动人民所爱戴的马列主义的优秀作品出现。
    在新时代下，马列主义政治经济学应当成为各级教育中的重要的必修课程，借以提高一般干部马列主义的理论水平，尤其关于政治经济学方面的修养，以培养大批具有真正的马列主义政治经济学知识，并能与实际结合，担负理论斗争指导实际行动的革命知识分子。培养大批既有理论又能联系实际，掌握政策，既能通晓业务又能掌握技术的财经工作干部，也已经是今天新民主主义革命进入最后胜利阶段迫不容缓的严重任务了。
    政治经济学与革命的党务工作
    马列主义理论的任务，在于阐发社会发展的规律，并使工人阶级的政党能够依据这些规律，去领导工人阶级与其他劳动人民进行革命斗争，改造社会、改造世界、改造人类。但是“研究社会历史规律的关键，并不是要到人们底头脑中，到社会的观点和思想中去探求，而是要到社会在每个一定历史时期所采取的生产方式中，即要到社会底经济中去探求。”（联共党史简明教程第四章第二节），因此斯大林同志又教导我们：“无产阶级党要想成为真正的党，首先就应精通生产发展底规律，社会经济发展底规律。”“为了在政治上不犯错误，无产阶级党在制定自己的党纲以及进行实际活动时，首先应以生产发展底规律，应以社会经济发展的规律为出发点。”（同上）以上这些要求我们从生产方式中，从社会经济中去探求社会发展的规律，要求我们精通生产发展的规律，精通社会经济发展底规律，并要求我们依据这些规律掌握党的纲领政策，这就是要求我们必须学习马列主义政治经济学，精通马列主义政治经济学，并把马列主义政治经济学与客观的革命实际密切结合起来。因此，马列主义政治经济学对于整个无产阶级、工人阶级的政党—共产党说来，它是党的纲领路线方针政策与实际行动所据以决定、所据以出发的不可缺少的武器，对于每一个共产党员说来，是他们革命的宇宙观、世界观与人生观，即整个革命的世界观所据以确立的基础，故马列主义政治经济学的教育学习成为党的教育与党内教　绝对不可缺少的部分，应为每一个共产党员每一个革命战士所重视。如从工人阶级政党对政权工作的领导而言，也是不能离开马列主义政治经济学这一战斗的武器的。中华人民共和国是中国工人阶级先锋队——中国共产党领导的国家，所有一切军事的、政治的、经济的、群运的、文化教育的、外交的、司法的、公安的各种政权工作，都是必须在共产党的领导之下来进行，而这个领导权或领导作用的体现发挥，乃完全是离不开马列主义政治经济学这门科学的战斗的武器的。例如：党的统一战线政策的确立和执行，党的土地政策、工商业政策、贸易政策、货币、金融政策、财政、税收政策等一系列财经政策的确立实施与检查，假使要没有马列主义政治经济学这一理论知识，那是不行的。仅以党的组织工作中党员、干部的阶级成份与出身的划分评定而论，也必须具有这方面的丰富知识，否则就会发生偏差。
