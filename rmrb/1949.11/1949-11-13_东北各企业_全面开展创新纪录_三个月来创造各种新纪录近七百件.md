Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 12th: The movement to create new records is developing daily in state-owned and public enterprises in the Northeast. Most of the enterprises under the Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government have moved from the mobilization and deployment phase to a phase of focusing on comprehensive promotion, with the exception of a few factories and mines. In the Machinery Administration's factories, where the movement to create new records started earliest, nearly 700 new records of various kinds have been created in the last three months, reaching 694. The Coal Mining Administration's mines are focusing on coal mining, tunneling, and well-drilling work, formulating new record regulations, and paying timely attention to rewards, guiding the movement to create new records towards comprehensive development. The average daily mining and tunneling rate per person in Hegang Coal Mine has increased from 0.51 tons to 0.56 tons. The movement to create new records in the Fushun Mining Bureau has also quickly spread to all units of the entire mine under the leadership of the Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the personal participation of responsible cadres from administrative departments and trade unions. The mining and tunneling of the Victory Coal Mine has continuously improved, from exceeding the predetermined 71% to exceeding 115%. After a thorough inspection of the deployment work, the Textile Administration's movement to create new records has also begun to deepen. The cotton consumption rate of the Shenyang Weaving Factory in October was 72% lower than the prescribed standard, and the output of twill fabric increased by 21%. The Northeast Railway Administration, in accordance with the spirit of the instructions from higher authorities, proposed to widely carry out the "Iron Ox" movement in the entire Northeast Railway, named after the "Iron Ox" heroic locomotive of the Suihua Locomotive Depot, in order to meet the heavy transportation tasks in winter. Locomotive No. 631 of the Qiqihar Railway Administration has created a new record of safe running for 140,000 kilometers. The factories of the Military Industry Department have also launched a production competition with challenges between teams, groups, and individuals, and new records are constantly emerging. In the past, the Machinery Department of a certain factory could only manufacture more than 60 parts of a weapon per person per day (eight hours), but since worker Wei Fuan improved the tools, he created a new record of making 240 parts a day. The recent production efficiency of veteran worker Xia De'en of the Third Institute has exceeded the highest record during the puppet Manchukuo period by about three times. In addition, some public enterprises in Songjiang, Liaodong, Jilin and other provinces and cities have also continuously created many new records in improving quality, shortening working hours, and saving raw materials.

The reason why the above-mentioned many enterprises can gradually develop the movement to create new records is due to the universal adoption of the following three methods: (1) Discovering and cultivating new records of progressive workers, giving timely praise and rewards, introducing their production experience, and calling on all workers to learn from them to promote weak and backward links, and develop from one person to the entire group, class, and factory. The new record movement in the Machinery Administration factories was launched in this way. (2) The administrative leaders of each factory put forward general production goals, closely cooperated with the Chinese Communist Party branch, trade union, and youth league of each factory, and called on and organized all workers to create new records in order to achieve this general goal. For example, in October, Anshan Iron and Steel Company proposed that, under the condition of ensuring a certain quality of steel, the output should be increased by 10% compared with the past, and announced that rewards would be given according to the level of the new record. Therefore, the open hearth furnace class, gas team, crane class, and repair class of Anshan Iron and Steel Company all made guarantees to each other and agreed to supervise and check each other, thus creating a new record of smelting a furnace of steel in five hours and fifteen minutes (previously it took about ten hours to smelt a furnace). (3) Factory and mine managers personally take the lead, breaking through one point and promoting the overall situation. For example, Xu Hongwen, deputy manager of Benxi Coal and Iron Company, led engineers and technicians to the rock tunnel site to repeatedly study and test the problems of drilling angle, depth, distance, and explosive amount. As a result, the tunneling efficiency was increased by 147% compared with the puppet Manchukuo period. In one month, the consumption of explosives, detonators, and fuses alone was 366 million yuan less than in May and June this year. The above-mentioned three methods all take whether responsible cadres personally participate in the leadership as the central key to the success of the movement. Shenyang Chemical Factory has made the movement develop better because responsible cadres pay attention to implementing division of labor leadership through the factory management committee, study and analyze the situation, and give specific instructions to the lower levels. Conversely, some factories have achieved little because they have completely pushed the actual work to the "New Record Movement Committee."

At present, although the movement to create new records in various parts of the Northeast has been initially launched, it is still extremely unbalanced. Generally speaking, it can be divided into three types: First, the production enthusiasm and creativity of workers and staff have been mobilized, and factories and mines are developing in depth and breadth, but the number of such factories and mines is not large. These factories and mines are now studying and stipulating quotas for product working hours, quality, and raw material consumption based on labor efficiency and equipment utilization rate improvement conditions, so as to try out over-quota rewards on this basis, and further rationalize production organization and system. The second is factories and mines where the movement to create new records is just beginning but has not yet formed a widespread mass movement. These factories and mines are the most numerous. These factories and mines still need to continue to overcome difficulties such as inappropriate planning, unreasonable labor organization, and insufficient raw material supply in the movement, and correct and prevent the tendencies that have already occurred and may occur, such as damaging machines and tools, and workers being too tired, so as to make the movement steadily move towards comprehensive development. As for the factories and mines that are preparing or have not yet prepared to launch the movement to create new records, it is not that the conditions are not available, but that some leading cadres still do not have a sufficient understanding of the great significance of the movement to create new records, and they have many incorrect views on this movement. As long as they recognize the importance of this movement, give specific guidance, and actively start organizing, the movement can be quickly launched.

    东北各企业
    全面开展创新纪录
    三个月来创造各种新纪录近七百件
    【新华社沈阳十二日电】东北国营、公营各企业创造新纪录运动日益开展。东北人民政府工业部所属各企业，除了个别厂矿外，大部分都已先后由动员布置时期转入有重点地向全面推广的阶段。创造新纪录运动开展最早的机械管理局各工厂，最近三个月来所创造的各种新纪录已达六百九十四件。煤矿管理局各矿山则以采煤、掘进、打井工作为重点，拟定了新的纪录规程，并及时注意奖励，引导创造新纪录运动向全面发展。鹤岗煤矿每人每天平均采掘率已由零点五一吨，增至零点五六吨。抚顺矿务局的创造新纪录运动，也在中共市委领导和各行政、工会负责干部亲自参加下，很快普及到全矿各单位。所属胜利煤矿的采掘不断提高，从超过预定的百分之七十一提高到超过百分之一百十五。纺织管理局自周密检查了布置工作后，创造新纪录运动也开始深入。沈阳织布厂十月份的棉花消耗率，较规定的标准节省百分之七十二，斜纹布的产量增加了百分之二十一。东北铁路总局则根据上级指示的精神，提出在东北全路广泛开展以绥化机务段“铁牛号”英雄机车为名的“铁牛”运动，以便迎接冬季繁重的运输任务。齐齐哈尔铁路管理局六三一号机车，已创造了安全走行十四万公里的新纪录。军事工业部各工厂，也以班、组和个人互相挑战，开展了生产竞赛，新的纪录不断涌现。某厂第四所机械部过去每人每天（八小时）制造一种武器的零件仅六十余个，但自工人魏福安改进工具后，就创造了一天做二百四十个的新纪录。第三所老工人夏德恩最近的生产能率，已超过伪满时期的最高纪录约三倍。此外，松江、辽东、吉林等省市的若干公营企业也不断在改进质量、缩短工时、节约原料各方面创造出许多的新纪录。
    上述许多企业所以能使创造新纪录运动逐步开展，是由于普遍采取了以下三种方式：（一）发现和培养进步工人的新纪录，及时予以表扬奖励，介绍其生产经验，号召全体工人向他们学习，以推动薄弱和落后的环节，并由一个人发展到全组、全班、全厂中去。机械管理局各工厂的新纪录运动，就是这样开展起来的。（二）由各工厂行政领导上提出总的生产目标，与各该厂中共支部、工会、青年团密切配合，号召和组织全体工人为达到这一总的目标而创造新纪录。如鞍山钢铁公司于十月份提出：在保证钢的一定质量条件下，产量要比以前提高百分之十，并宣布按新纪录的高低给予奖励。因此，鞍山钢铁公司平炉班、煤气组、吊车班、修理班、都互相提出保证，并约定互相督促检查，就此创造了五小时十五分炼钢一炉的新纪录（以前约十小时炼一炉）。（三）厂矿管理人员亲自带头，突破一点，推动全盘。如本溪煤铁公司副经理徐宏文，带领工程师、技师等到岩石坑道现场，对于打眼的斜度、深度、距离和炮药量等问题反复研究试验结果，比伪满时期的掘进能率提高了百分之一百四十七。一个月中，仅炮药，雷管，引火线的消耗，即比今年五、六月间节省东北币三亿六千六百万元。前述三种方式，都是以负责干部是否亲自参加领导为运动开展好坏的中心关键。沈阳化学工厂，由于负责干部注意通过工厂管理委员会实行分工领导，研究分析情况，并给下面以具体指示，就使运动开展得较好。反之，某些工厂因为把实际工作完全推给“新纪录运动委员会”去进行，其所获的成绩就不大。
    目前东北各地的创造新纪录运动虽已初步开展，但仍极不平衡。一般说来可分三种类型：首先是工人、职员等的生产积极性和创造性已被发动起来，并正在向着深广发展的厂矿，这种厂矿数量还不算多。这些厂矿现正根据劳动效率和设备运用率提高等条件，研究规定产品的工时、质量、原材料消耗等定额，以便在此基础上试行超额奖励，使生产组织和制度进一步合理化。其次是创造新纪录运动正在开始，但还没有形成广泛群众运动的厂矿，这类厂矿为数最多。这些厂矿还需要在运动中继续克服计划不恰当、劳动组织不合理、原料供应不上等困难，并纠正和防止已产生和可能产生的如损坏机器、工具，工人过于疲劳的偏向，以便使运动稳步走向全面开展。至于正在准备或尚未准备开展创造新纪录运动的厂矿，并不是条件不具备，而是某些领导干部对于创造新纪录运动的重大意义还认识不足，而且对于这个运动有着许多不正确的看法。只要他们认识这个运动的重要性，加以具体的指导，积极着手组织，就可使运动很快地开展起来。
