    The Soviet Union Does Not Want War, Persists in Peace
    Any War Adventure by Imperialism is Digging Its Own Grave and Seeking Its Own Destruction

    In England, most newspapers in London published Malenkov's report. The bourgeois newspapers' headlines focused on the exposure in Malenkov's report of the American plan to dominate the world. The newspapers pointed out Malenkov's explanation of how the Soviet Union utilizes atomic energy for peaceful construction, and on the other hand, emphasized that the Soviet Union is now stronger than ever and surrounded by friendly countries. The newspapers called on readers to pay attention to what Malenkov said, that the Soviet Union is fighting for peace but is not afraid of war, and that war would in fact cause disaster in the capitalist world.

    In France, newspapers in Paris excerpted Malenkov's report. The newspapers mainly emphasized Malenkov's remarks on the Soviet Union's peaceful policy and the basic principles of the Soviet government's foreign policy. L'Humanité emphasized that Malenkov's report stated that the Soviet Union safeguards peace and supports the cause of peace, and that bellicose gambling will bring nothing but disaster to the imperialists.

    In Austria, the Vienna "Sunday Newspaper" published a summary of Malenkov's report, emphasizing Malenkov's statement: "The forces of democracy and socialism are growing, while the forces of capitalism and warmongers are declining." "Evening News" quoted Malenkov in the headline: If imperialism launches a third world war, it will mean the destruction of the entire capitalist world.

    In the capitals of the Netherlands and Belgium, the morning newspapers published Malenkov's report. The Dutch "People's Daily" particularly emphasized the point: In the Soviet Union, atomic energy can and should be a powerful tool for technological progress. "World Daily" drew attention to the point that the Soviet Union will do everything possible to establish a lasting world peace.

    In the four capitals of Finland, Sweden, Norway and Denmark, all newspapers published summaries of the report. The headlines of the newspapers respectively paid attention to the following points: 1. The socialist world is superior to the capitalist world, whether in peacetime or wartime; 2. If a third world war occurs, it will end capitalism; 3. The Soviet Union does not want war and persists in peace. Atomic energy is used for peace and prosperity in the Soviet Union.

    Newspapers in the capitals of Egypt and Israel published summaries of Malenkov's report. The focus of the newspapers' headlines and summaries were on the same point: the Soviet Union does not want war and will do everything possible to prevent war; if the American and British warmongers launch a new war, it will be the destruction of the entire capitalist world.

    In Australia, all afternoon newspapers in Sydney published the report. The Sydney Sun particularly noted the following part of the report, namely, that the Soviet Union is not afraid of peaceful competition with the capitalist world, and any war adventure by imperialism will end in imperialism's own disaster.

    Canadian Broadcasting Corporation rebroadcast the report, reminding people of what Malenkov said: If capitalism launches a new war, it will be digging its own grave. The Ottawa Citizen particularly emphasized the section of the report that exposed the American imperialist plan.

    在英国，伦敦的大多数报纸都登载了马林科夫的报告。资产阶级报纸的标题集中于马林科夫报告中对美国统治世界计划的揭发。报纸指出了马林科夫对苏联如何利用原子能于和平建设的说明，另一方面又强调苏联现在已较以往更为强大，而且周围都是友好的国家。报纸要读者注意马林科夫所称苏联正在为和平奋斗，但也不害怕战争，战争事实上将在资本主义世界引起灾难。
    在法国，巴黎各报都摘用了马林科夫的报告。各报主要强调马林科夫所讲的苏联和平政策和苏联政府外交政策的基本原则。人道报强调马林科夫的报告所称苏联维护和平及拥护和平事业，而好战的赌博则除了灾难之外不会给帝国主义分子任何东西。
    在奥国，维也纳“礼拜一日报”刊登了马林科夫报告的摘要，该报强调马林科夫的下述声明：“民主和社会主义的力量正在增长，而资本主义和战争贩子的力量，则正在下降。”“晚报”在标题中引用马林科夫的下述的话：如果帝国主义发动第三次世界大战，这将意味着整个资本主义世界的灭亡。
    在荷兰与比利时的首都，各晨报都刊登了马林科夫的报告。荷京“人民报”特别重视下述一点：在苏联，原子能能够而且应当是技术进步的有力工具。“世界日报”唤起人们注意苏联将尽一切力量以建立世界持久和平一节。
    在芬兰、瑞典、挪威与丹麦四国首都的所有报纸都刊登了报告的摘要。各报的标题分别注意下列几点：一、社会主义世界，不论在平时或战时都优于资本主义世界；二、如果发生第三次世界大战，就会结束资本主义；三、苏联不要战争，坚持和平。原子能在苏联用于和平和繁荣。
    埃及和以色列首都的各报，都摘要刊载了马林科夫的报告。各报标题和摘要的重心都放在同一点上：苏联不要战争，并将尽一切力量防止战争，如果美英战争贩子发动新的战争，那将是整个资本主义世界的灭亡。
    在澳大利亚，悉尼的所有下午报纸都刊登了报告。悉尼太阳报特别注意报告的如下部分，即苏联并不害怕与资本主义世界进行和平的竞争，帝国主义的任何战争冒险，都将以帝国主义自己的灾祸告终。
    加拿大无线电广播公司转播了报告，该台提醒人们注意马林科夫所说的：如果资本主义发动新的战争，它就是自掘坟墓。渥太华公民报特别把报告中揭露美帝国主义计划一节，予以强调。
