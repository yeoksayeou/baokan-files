　　The Idea of International Solidarity and Fraternity Will Surpass All Borders and Distances
    Speech by World Federation of Trade Unions Vice-Chairman Subka
    Dear Comrades:
    I am very happy to participate in the First Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference as a member of the Executive Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions. Here, I would like to extend the most fraternal greetings on behalf of the revolutionary trade union movement of the People's Democratic Republic of Czechoslovakia to you, the representatives of the working class and all working people of Asia and Australia.
    It has already been said that this meeting is of the utmost historical significance. This meeting has strengthened the situation of trade union organizations in all countries on the two continents. At the same time, this meeting has strengthened the important role that the World Federation of Trade Unions wants to play. In history, for the first time, a central body of the international trade union movement has launched its activities in these countries in such a way. The development of the trade union movement is closely linked to the development of progressive forces after the Second World War.
    The international trade union movement is one of the most important and necessary parts of the common camp against the enemies, the enemies of the people, and the enemies of progressive development. This is why international reactionary forces are attacking the World Federation of Trade Unions.
    In the camp of our enemies are concentrated capitalists who have fled from liberated countries, as well as international agents, spies, and provocateurs. Obeying the orders of international reactionary forces, they vainly attempt to destroy the World Federation of Trade Unions. The splitters like Deakin, Carey, and Kupers have also run into this camp. But the conspiracy after the First World War cannot be repeated. In the recent twenty-five years, the progressive trade union movement has triumphed.
    The splitters' efforts to separate the workers of liberated countries from the workers of capitalist countries have completely failed. They have removed themselves from our ranks, and their departure has greatly contributed to the closer cooperation of progressive forces in our common camp. The idea of international solidarity and fraternity will surpass all borders and all distances. The important social struggles of workers in the United States, Britain, France, Italy, and other capitalist countries, just like the liberation struggles of the people in Indonesia, Vietnam, Korea, and other oppressed countries, are shaking the foundations of these capitalist countries. A victory won in any part of the common camp will inevitably strengthen the strength of all fighters in the anti-imperialist camp.
    The comrade from South Korea has already mentioned that the victory of the Chinese people has strengthened the strength of the South Korean trade unions and inspired their struggle for liberation. But this fact is not limited to South Korea. The victory of the Chinese people represents the source of hope and strength for all oppressed countries. This victory is also significant for our republic, the Czechoslovak Republic, even though we are already a free people's democratic country.
    Our republic was established after the First World War under the decisive influence of the Russian October Revolution. At that time, the capitalists seized power through the treacherous policies of the reformists. The Czech bourgeoisie could not protect the vital interests of the people. In 1939, the republic was destroyed and subjected to the ravages of German fascism. At that time, the working class opposed the most brutal terror. After fascism was defeated, our republic was liberated again. We thank the Soviet Union and its Red Army for liberating us. The Soviet Union is not only our liberator for us and other people's democratic countries such as Poland, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, and Albania, but also our ally and protector, and, last but not least, our example for socialist development.
    In Czechoslovakia, as in other people's democratic countries, trade unions play an active role in building a new and better socialist order. We do this by adopting the experience of the Soviet trade unions. We have successfully completed our two-year plan, restored the destruction of the war, and rebuilt our economy. By the end of this year, we will complete the first year of our five-year plan. This five-year plan is already a plan to build our socialist republic and will greatly improve the living standards of our people. The effect of this five-year plan will be very great, especially in those areas that have always been neglected by capitalists, such as Slovakia. We will build new factories and new cities in Slovakia. There is no unemployment in our country now. We have established a new wage system based on the principle of merit and ability. Women and young people enjoy full and equal rights in production.
    Social legislation has been established, such as vacations, social insurance, rest homes, and sanatoriums, which are now serving the workers, not the bourgeoisie as in the past. We have established new homes for children, new schools, cultural palaces, hospitals, and sanatoriums. This is the result of liberation from the shackles of capitalism. The economic development of our country has convinced every worker that life without capitalist exploitation is much better. The splitters of the international trade union movement are trying to prevent the working people of capitalist countries from understanding this situation. This is the main reason why the imperialist forces oppose the progressive people's democratic countries and the Soviet Union.
    The Budapest trial proves that the agents of American imperialism are ubiquitous. These facts urge us to be extremely vigilant and to strengthen the unity of the workers' movement. It is those who support Chiang Kai-shek, those who persecute and massacre those who fight for the liberation of oppressed people, and those imperialists who endanger peace and progressive development who are endangering the security and achievements of the people's democratic countries.
    The victory of the Chinese people is also the victory of each of us. In building a new China, a great and important task falls on the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. This task is not easy. But you have all the conditions to make China a country of free and happy people.
    China's abundant resources will no longer serve imperialism. The Chinese people will no longer be exploited. They will work for themselves and their descendants. Our Chinese comrades will surely receive active and effective assistance from Czechoslovakia and other people's democratic countries. With the close support of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, China will surely embark on the road we are already on. We hope that the All-China Federation of Trade Unions will achieve all victories on this road.
    The struggle of the workers in capitalist and oppressed countries and the great efforts of the liberated people will make our common ideals and principles more powerful and will make our unity under the leadership of the World Federation of Trade Unions more solid.
    Long live the international solidarity and fraternity of all workers and progressive forces in the world!
    Long live the World Federation of Trade Unions!

### 国际团结和友爱的思想将越过一切国境和路程  世界工联副主席苏布卡讲话

　　国际团结和友爱的思想将越过一切国境和路程
    世界工联副主席苏布卡讲话
    【新华社北京二十一日电】世界工联副主席、捷克斯洛伐克工会理事会副主席苏布卡今天在亚澳工会会议的讲话全文如下：亲爱的同志们：
    我很高兴以世界工联执行局委员的身份参加第一次的亚洲澳洲工会会议。在这里，我愿意代表人民民主的捷克斯洛伐克共和国的、革命的、职工运动向你们亚洲澳洲工人阶级和全体劳动人民的代表致以最兄弟般的敬礼。
    已经有人说过了，这次会议，是具有最重要的历史意义的。这个会议加强了两个大陆上所有国家的工会组织的情况。这个会议同时加强了世界工联所要起的重要作用。在历史上，国际职工运动的一个中央机构第一次以这样的方法展开了它在这些国家的活动。职工会运动的发展是和第二次世界大战以后进步力量的发展所密切联系着的。
    国际职工运动是反对敌人、人民的敌人、进步发展的敌人的共同阵营中，最重要、最必要的部分之一。这就是国际反动势力为什么攻击世界工会联合会的原因。
    在我们的敌人的阵营里，集中了从解放了的国家逃亡的资本家，集中了国际特务、间谍和挑拨者。他们服从国际反动势力的命令，妄想使世界工联消灭的狄金、加莱、库伯斯和其他分裂者也跑到了这个阵营里去。但是第一次世界大战以后的阴谋是不能够再重复了。在最近的二十五年中，进步的职工运动已经战胜了。
    分裂者想把解放国家的工人和资本主义国家的工人分散开来的努力已经完全失败了。他们已经使自己退出了我们的队伍，他们的退出，大大地有助于我们共同阵营中进步力量的更加密切合作。国际团结和友爱的思想将越过一切国境，越过一切路程。美国、英国、法国、意大利和其他资本主义国家内工人们的重要的社会斗争，正如印度尼西亚、越南、朝鲜和其他被压迫国家内人民的解放斗争一样，正在动摇着这些资本主义国家的基础。在共同阵营中不管那一部分所赢得的胜利，必然加强全体反帝阵营中一切战士的力量。
    南朝鲜的同志已经提过了，中国人民的胜利加强了南朝鲜工会的力量，鼓舞了他们争取解放的斗争。但是这个事实不仅限于南朝鲜，中国人民的胜利代表了一切被压迫国家的希望和力量的源泉。这个胜利对于我们的共和国，就是捷克斯洛伐克共和国也是有意义的。虽然我们已经是一个自由的人民民主国家。
    我们的共和国是在第一次大战后，受了俄罗斯十月革命的决定性影响而建立的。当时改良主义者的阴谋政策使资本家攫取了政权。捷克的资产阶级不能够保卫人民的切身利益。一九三九年，共和国被摧毁了，听受德国法西斯主义的蹂躏，工人阶级当时反对了最残暴的恐怖。在法西斯主义被战败之后，我们的共和国又被解放了。我们感谢苏联和它的红军解放了我们。苏联对于我们和其他人民民主的国家如波兰、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、保加利亚和阿尔巴尼亚来说不仅是我们的解放者，而且是我们的同盟者和保护者，最后，也是很重要的，还是我们社会主义发展的榜样。
    在捷克斯洛伐克，正如在其他人民民主国家里一样，工会在建立一个新的，和更好的社会主义秩序中，起着积极的作用。我们这样作是采取了苏联工会的经验。我们已经胜利地完成了我们的两年计划，恢复了战争的破坏和重建了我们的经济。到今年的年底我们将完成我们的五年计划的第一年。这个五年计划已经是一个建设我们社会主义共和国的计划，并且将会大大提高我们人民的生活水准。这个五年计划的效果一定会是很大的，特别是在那些一向被资本家所忽视的地区、如斯洛伐克。我们将在斯洛伐克建立新的工厂和新的城市。在我们的国家里现在已经没有失业了。我们已经根据功绩和能力的原则制定了一个新的工资制度。妇女和青年在生产中享有充分平等的权利。
    社会立法已经建立起来了，例如休假、社会保险、休息所和温泉疗养所已经是为工人服务，而不是象过去那样为资产阶级服务了。我们建立了儿童的新家庭、新学校、文化宫、医院和疗养所。这都是从资本主义的枷锁下解放的结果。我国的经济发展说服了每一个工人：没有资本家剥削的生活要好得多了。国际职工运动的分裂者企图阻碍资本主义国家的劳动人民了解这个情况。这是帝国主义势力反对进步的人民民主国家和反对苏联的主要原因。
    布达佩斯的审判案证明了美帝国主义的特务是无孔不钻的。这些事实督促我们要极端地警觉，督促我们要加强工人运动的统一。正是那些支持蒋介石，那些迫害和屠杀为被压迫人民争解放的人，那些危害和平和进步发展的帝国主义者在危害着人民民主国家的安全和成就。
    中国人民的胜利也就是我们每个人的胜利。在建立新中国中，一部分伟大的和重要的任务落在中华全国总工会的身上。这个任务不是很容易的。但是，你们有一切的条件使中国成为一个自由和幸福人民的国家。
    中国的丰富资源不会再为帝国主义服务了。中国人民不会再受剥削了。他们将要为自己和自己的子孙工作。我们的中国同志一定可以得到捷克斯洛伐克和其他人民民主国家的积极的和有效的帮助。在苏联和人民民主国家的密切支持之下，中国一定会走上我们已经在进行着的道路。我们希望中华全国总工会在这条道路上获得一切胜利。
    资本主义国家和被压迫国家的工人的斗争和被解放人民的巨大努力，会使我们的共同理想和原则更加有力量，会使我们在世界工联领导下的统一更加巩固。
    全世界一切工人和进步力量以国际团结、友爱万岁！
    世界工会联合会万岁！
