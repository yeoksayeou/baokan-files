　　Fleas, Rats, and Plague
    Whether it's bubonic plague or pneumonic plague, tracing back to the origins, both are related to rats and fleas. Therefore, preventing plague should include preventing rats and fleas. So, first we should understand the habits of rats and fleas.

    Rat Habits: Rats can be divided into two major categories: domestic rats and wild rats. Domestic rats can be further divided into large and small. Small rats are a special kind; they are naturally small and do not grow larger, and it is not because they are young. There are two kinds of large rats: one is large with a short tail, brown in color, and wild in nature. They make nests in the corners of walls and underground, and sometimes go to the wild. The other is short with a long tail, somewhat black in color, and likes to live in people's homes, often nesting in the ceilings and upper parts of houses, and does not like to go to the wild.

    Wild rats grow in the fields. Animals similar to rats, commonly found in North China, include the vole (dou shu), and another called the "ground row" (di pai zi) (also known as microtus brandtii), as well as squirrels. These animals live in holes in the fields and do not go to human dwellings. The kind of large domestic rat is the one that often interacts with them, often traveling between cities, towns, and fields.

    Whether domestic or wild rats, their nature is to live in groups. This trait is even more evident in domestic rats. The commonly said "rat evacuation" is enough to prove this group behavior. If a family raises a cat, and the cat catches a few rats, then the rats in the house disappear. This is because the rest have collectively moved away.

    Now let's talk about fleas. Fleas are external parasites that live on the outside of various animals' bodies. Various animals (domestic rats, dogs, cats, humans) have their own specific fleas that parasitize them. Various wild rats also have their own different fleas that parasitize them. Fleas reproduce quickly. In North China, the period from May to September is the flea breeding season. Fleas lay eggs; one female flea can lay three hundred to five hundred eggs. These eggs develop into larvae in the soil, become pupae, and then hatch into fleas. This hatching takes only about ten days in the summer. The nests where animals live are the best places for fleas to breed. When animals stay still in their nests, fleas lay the most eggs, which fall into the soil in the nests and hatch into fleas. Different fleas usually like to bite the animals they parasitize, but when they cannot bite those animals, they can also bite humans.

    When a rat gets the plague and dies, its fleas fall off and go to other rats, thus infecting more rats. After many rats die, the surviving rats feel that the place they live is unlucky and have a mass migration, moving to other places. The fleas on the rats, having no rats to bite, then come to bite humans, thus humans get the plague. The rats that move to the new place are already sick, and through fleas, they infect the rats in that place, and then infect the people in that place. A portion of the rats that got sick but did not die develop immunity, and some of these rats still carry the plague bacteria, thus becoming carriers of the plague bacteria. This is how the rat plague epidemic comes to an end. When more new rats are born the following year, the plague will spread again through the rats via fleas.

    However, every person who suffers from the plague is not necessarily directly infected by fleas from rats, because after a person gets the plague, any flea (human flea, dog flea, cat flea), or even lice, can transmit the disease to another person. If the disease turns into pneumonic plague in late autumn when the weather is cold, then it is even more dangerous because it is spread by droplets and sputum from coughing.

    Since rats and fleas have such a dangerous ability to transmit the plague, and since rats and fleas are present in every household, everyone should work together and take practical action to help the government eliminate these sources of plague transmission. It is not difficult to prevent and eliminate this common enemy of the people, "the plague." There is ample proof of this in the Northeast.

    Specific tasks that should be done to prevent the plague: First, eliminate flea breeding grounds. Beds, heated brick beds (kangs), under beds, and cat and dog nests should be cleaned every day. The dust inside contains many flea eggs and larvae, so the soil swept from these places should not be thrown away randomly, but should be burned on a fire. Empty rooms and rooms where things are stored should also be cleaned, and the swept dust should also be burned. If rat holes are found, the best way is to stuff paper, rags, or waste cotton soaked in kerosene into the holes to kill the fleas inside. If you can spray kerosene under the bed, on the heated brick bed, and in the cat and dog nests, or spray a 5% solution of DDT dissolved in kerosene, or use kerosene or DDT kerosene solution, spray the corners and roots of the walls in the house, that would be even better. Spraying kerosene or DDT once a week or every two weeks is sufficient. Cats and dogs also have fleas. In areas where the disease is already prevalent, cats and dogs should be killed. In areas where it has not yet spread, you can find ways to eliminate fleas on cats and dogs. The best way is to rub a 10% DDT and talcum powder mixture all over the cat and dog, massaging it into their fur, and then keep the cat or dog confined for half a day. Sweep up the fleas that fall off and burn them. You can do this once a week.

    If you catch a rat or find a dead rat, you should immediately pour kerosene all over its body to kill it and the fleas on it. If there is no kerosene, you can also pour boiling water on it, otherwise it is very dangerous if the fleas escape.

### 跳蚤、老鼠和鼠疫

　　跳蚤、老鼠和鼠疫
    不论是腺性鼠疫、肺性鼠疫，追究起源都是和老鼠与跳蚤有关系的，所以防鼠疫就应当防老鼠和跳蚤。因此，首先我们应当知道老鼠和跳蚤的习性。
    老鼠的习性：老鼠可分为家鼠和野鼠两大类。家鼠又有大小之分，小老鼠是特别的一种，天然的个儿小，长不大，并不是生下的时间短。大老鼠又有两种：一种是身子大、尾巴短，棕色，性子野，在墙角根和地下作窝，有时也到野外去。另一种是身子短、尾巴长，颜色有些发黑，喜欢住在人的家里，常在天花板和房子的上部作窝，不大喜欢到野外去。
    野老鼠是生长在田野的。和老鼠类似的动物，华北常见的有一种叫豆鼠，还有一种俗称地排子（又叫鼷鼠），另外还有松鼠。这些动物都在田间地下作洞住在里面，不到人住的房舍里去。常和它们来往的是那一种大的家鼠，那种大的家鼠常来往于城市、村镇和田野之间。
    无论家鼠或野鼠，它们的性情都是群居的，这种性情在家鼠更是显而易见，平常所说的耗子大搬家，就足以证明这个群居的事实。如果某一家，养上一只猫，猫捉了几个老鼠以后，家里的老鼠就没有了，这就是其余的都集体的搬走了。
    现在我们再谈谈跳蚤，跳蚤是外寄生物，寄生在各种动物身体的外面，各种动物（家鼠、狗、猫、人）都有它的特种跳蚤寄生，各种野鼠也有他们自己不同的跳蚤寄生。跳蚤的繁殖很快，在华北，由五月到九月期间，是跳蚤繁生的时期。跳蚤产卵，一个母跳蚤，可以生三百到五百个卵，这卵在土里生成幼虫，变成蛹，然后孵化成为跳蚤。这种孵化在夏季只有十天左右。动物所住的窝里，是跳蚤繁殖最好的地方，动物在窝里不动的时候，跳蚤产卵最多，产出来的卵就掉在窝里的土里，孵化成为跳蚤。各种不同的跳蚤平常都喜欢咬自己所寄生的动物，但在咬不到那种动物的时候，也可以咬人。
    一个老鼠得了鼠疫病死了，它的跳蚤就掉下来，又到别的老鼠身上去，这样就传染更多的老鼠，老鼠死的多了以后，没死的老鼠感觉住的地方不吉利，就来一个大搬家，搬到别的地方去。在老鼠身上的跳蚤，没有老鼠可咬，于是到人身上来咬人，这样人就得了鼠疫。搬到新地方去的老鼠已有了病，借着跳蚤又传染那地方的老鼠，又传染给那地方的人。得了病没有死的一部分老鼠有了免疫力，其中一些老鼠仍然带着鼠疫菌，就成了鼠疫菌的保菌者，这样老鼠的鼠疫大流行，就算告一段落。等到第二年新生的老鼠多了，再由老鼠借着跳蚤传染就再流行。
    但是每一个患鼠疫的人，并不一定都是由跳蚤直接从老鼠那里传来的，因为人得了鼠疫以后，无论什么跳蚤（人蚤、犬蚤、猫蚤）甚而至于虱子，都可以把这病传染给另一个人。若是这病到了深秋，天气寒冷，转成肺性鼠疫，那么由咳嗽出来的飞沫和痰传染，这样就更利害了。
    老鼠、跳蚤既然有着传染鼠疫这样的危险性。而且老鼠跳蚤，家家都有，每个人都应群策群力用实际的行动来协助政府消灭这些鼠疫传染的来源，就不难防止和消灭这个人民的公敌“鼠疫”。在东北已经有了充分的证明。
    防止鼠疫应该作的一些具体工作：第一就是消灭跳蚤的孳生地，床上、炕上、床底下、猫狗的窝里，应当每天打扫干净，里头的尘土有很多的跳蚤卵和幼虫，所以这些地方扫起来的土不要乱扔，应当放在火上烧了。空闲的屋子及存放东西的屋子也应当扫除干净，扫下来的尘土也应当烧了。如果发见老鼠洞，最好的方法是用纸、破布、或废棉浸上煤油塞在洞里用以杀死洞里的跳蚤。若是能在床底下、炕上、猫窝狗窝里喷上煤油，或者把百分之五的ＤＤＴ溶在煤油里喷，或用煤油或ＤＤＴ的煤油液，喷洒屋子里的墙角、墙根、就更好了。喷洒煤油或者ＤＤＴ，一星期或两星期一次就可以。猫狗身上也有跳蚤，在病已经流行的地方，猫狗应当杀死。在尚未流行的区域，可以设法消除猫狗身上的跳蚤，最好的方法是把猫狗的全身擦上百分之十的ＤＤＴ、滑石粉粉末，揉在毛里，然后再把猫狗关上半天，掉下来的跳蚤扫起来烧了，每一星期这样作一次就可以。
    若是捉住了老鼠或是有了死老鼠，应当立即把它的全身浇上煤油，杀死它和它身上的跳蚤。若是没有煤油，用开水浇也可以，否则跳蚤跑了是很危险的。
