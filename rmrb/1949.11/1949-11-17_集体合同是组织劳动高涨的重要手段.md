　　Collective Contract is an Important Means of Organizing Labor Upsurge
    V. Kuznetszov, Chairman of the Soviet Trade Union
    Under the auspices of the Council of Ministers, the Soviet trade unions, as in previous years, started concluding collective contracts with the management of enterprises in the industrial, transportation, and construction sectors from March.
    Collective contracts should become an organizational means for the creative activities of the broad masses of workers, engineering and technical personnel, and staff in the struggle to solve the great tasks assigned to our people by the Party and the government.
    During the war years and the post-war period, the composition of workers in enterprises has significantly changed. Many new young workers, who are participating in production for the first time, have joined the industrial and transportation sectors. They need help to quickly acquire the experience of socialist labor. Collective contracts are very useful to them in this regard.
    In our country, people's labor is not for capitalists, but for themselves, for their socialist country, and for the happiness of all the people: labor has become a glorious, strong, and heroic undertaking. The Soviet people, with their selfless labor, helped our motherland win a complete victory over its mortal enemies, and emerged from the arduous trials of war as a stronger and more tempered nation.
    The workers of our country understand very well that the better the national industrial plan is fulfilled, the more its products are produced, and the more the supply of goods to meet the needs of the people will be. The improvement of the material living conditions of the workers is inseparable from the growth of the entire national economy and the development of our industry and agriculture. Trade union organizations should constantly explain this to workers and staff, especially to those who are participating in production for the first time.
    The conclusion of collective contracts with the participation of the broad masses and the systematic assessment of the obligations stipulated in the contracts will undoubtedly enhance the enthusiasm of the workers, help to expand criticism of shortcomings in the organization of production, labor, wages, and the living and cultural facilities for workers and staff, and quickly eliminate these shortcomings.
    The Party has repeatedly emphasized the great significance of collective contracts in its resolutions, pointing out that they are an important organizational means to attract all workers and staff to actively struggle to fulfill and surpass the national plan. The resolution of the Sixteenth Party Congress called for extensive discussion of the most important parts of the collective contract at workers' meetings. The resolution of the Sixteenth Party Congress stated: "Only in the process of broad discussion by all members of the group participating in the collective contract, can each worker understand the provisions in it that stipulate their wage levels and the tasks that must be completed. Only the conscious participation of members in the formulation of the collective contract and throughout the entire process of its conclusion provides the necessary prerequisites for both familiarizing all workers with their production situation and its tasks in the general system of the national economy, and for the implementation of the solid discipline of production and association based on the obligations of both parties to the collective contract."
    The collective contract – this is the obligation of both the management and the factory trade union committee representing the workers' group. In our socialist country, there is no and can be no class contradiction between workers and managers. Our collective contract is fundamentally different from the collective contracts of capitalist countries (where workers have to fight against capitalists to resist wage cuts, extended working hours, maintain their living standards, and defend against exploitation) in this very aspect. In our case, both parties representing the conclusion of the collective contract belong to the same class and are pursuing a common goal, namely: to expand and promote socialist production as much as possible, to improve labor productivity, and on this basis to improve the material enjoyment and cultural level of the workers.
    The resolution of the Council of Ministers signed by Stalin pointed out that the purpose of concluding collective contracts is to ensure the completion and exceeding of production plans, the further development of labor productivity, the improvement of labor organization, and to enhance the responsibility of management and trade union organizations in improving the conditions of material life and cultural facilities for workers.
    Trade unions have a significant organizational and educational task. In order to complete and exceed the Five-Year Plan, it is necessary to significantly increase the work quotas for each worker in all departments, and call on every worker, engineer, technician, and staff to conscientiously fulfill the obligations assigned to them. The collective contract will undoubtedly promote the strengthening of labor discipline and help to carry out the struggle against the greedy and lazy, and against those who contribute little to the beneficial work of the country but only want to grab money desperately.
    The resolution of the Sixteenth Party Congress pointed out: In signing collective contracts to improve the material and cultural living standards of workers, especially the industrial proletariat, one should proceed from the interests of developing the overall national economy (the economy of the workers' state) and study the situation of industrial enterprise combinations, economic unions, and enterprises most attentively.
    "Under the signing of collective contracts, trade unions must resolutely eliminate the bureaucratic elements on the management side and the narrow-minded shop-ism and trade union-ism tendencies on the trade union organization side.
    Since the collective contract is the obligation of both the trade union organization and the management organization, all its parts should be completed not only by the management organization, but also actually by the workers' group organization."
    These instructions of the Sixteenth Party Congress have great significance at present.
    Our country has stepped into the second year of the new Stalin Five-Year Plan. In 1947, new great tasks were before the Soviet people. To restore the areas ravaged by the German aggressors and achieve further growth in industry, transportation, and agriculture, it is necessary to make great strides forward.
    We have every possibility to complete these tasks. Huge reserves are hidden in agriculture. They should be mobilized, and new possibilities for improving labor productivity should be explored.
    The collective contract should first of all include the responsibilities of both the administrative organs and the factory trade union committee representing the workers' group regarding the completion and exceeding of the state's plan for manufacturing products. The tasks approved by the government in 1947 are binding on both parties. The administrative organs and the workers' committee should also proceed from the view that the plan stipulated by the government is the minimum task, and it can and should be exceeded.
    Great attention must be paid to: the formulation and implementation of measures to ensure the development of labor productivity; the issue of eliminating losses and unproductive consumption; the fulfillment of production standards by all workers; the resolution of the reasons that hinder individual workers from fulfilling production standards; and the elimination of work stoppages. The collective contract should include the mutual obligations of adopting and disseminating advanced working methods, helping backward workers, and bringing them up to the advanced level.
    The collective contract should also include specific obligations to strengthen the inventive and rationalization work in the enterprise, adopt the suggestions of inventors and rationalizers and give them technical assistance, and similarly help the engineering and technical workers in the factory to engage in scientific research.
    When formulating and discussing the collective contract, workers, engineers, production team leaders should pay attention to issues such as strict saving when spending raw materials, reducing production waste, and strengthening the struggle against defects. This issue is important because the losses due to defects in many enterprises are very large.
    The conclusion of the collective contract will undoubtedly cause a new upsurge in socialist competition in the enterprise. The factory committee should organize workshop, shift, shock brigade, and individual professional competitions based on the conditions of the collective contract, and ensure the openness of the competition and encourage its victors.
    Initiated by the people of Leningrad and the miners of Donbass, a competition among drillers, pit workers, textile workers, and enterprises of the same nature not under the same department is currently unfolding with new force. Trade union and management personnel organizations must support this initiative.
    Everyone knows that any changes to labor wages must be decided by the government. This procedure is also effective under the conclusion of collective contracts. However, the management and trade union organizations should not therefore do nothing regarding wages. Their task is to create the conditions necessary to increase labor productivity, and thus increase wages. Therefore, when stipulating the tasks of the collective contract, it is first necessary to pay attention to the maximum expansion of the piece-rate payment system in the enterprise, which is a way to promote the highest increase in productivity.
    Currently, labor standards in enterprises and departments are very low. Standards based on empirical statistics dominate. In the factories of the Ministry of Work Machinery Manufacturing, technically based standards account for only 5 percent in total, in the factories of the Ministry of Machine Manufacturing and Tool Manufacturing only 10 percent, and in the enterprises of the electrical industry - 20 percent. The Ministry of Heavy Machine Manufacturing stipulated that the implementation of technically based standards in 1947 would account for only 34 percent of the total number of all standards, still considering this a great achievement.
    The dominance of empirical statistical standards will cause the appearance of "favorable" and "unfavorable" work, equalization of wages between skilled and unskilled workers, and hinder the growth of labor productivity. This will often lead to this situation: the vast majority of workers significantly exceed the manufacturing standards, but the enterprise's production plan is still not completed. This situation exists, for example, in many textile factories. This situation cannot be allowed to continue.
    According to the government's resolution in March, the manufacturing standards of many departments should be revised towards expansion. Such standards should stimulate the increase of labor productivity, constantly drive the administrative organs and workers to improve work, establish the latest achievements of technology, and improve the organization of labor.
    The collective contract should also reflect the issues of labor protection, safety technology, reducing morbidity and disability, and the general sanitary equipment conditions of labor in enterprises - which are important factors in improving labor productivity.
    The issue of cultivating the cadres of workers and engineering and technical workers for existing and newly established enterprises should occupy a large place in the collective contract. The serious responsibility for these issues falls on both the administrative organs and the factory groups. They must be effectively stipulated in the collective contract.
    The improvement of the lives of workers and staff, the reduction of mobility, and the strengthening of cadres in enterprises largely depend on the successful resolution of the housing issue - on the implementation of the plans for the construction of new housing and the repair of existing housing. However, the housing construction plan for 1946 was not completed, and many of the materials allocated by the government were not used. All departments completed less than 58 percent of the housing construction plan for 1946, and some departments were even worse.
    The government approved the housing construction plan for 1947, which is more than twice the scale of the housing construction plan for 1946. The residential area that should be started in cities and workers' new villages in 1947 is 13.8 million square meters. This is the great concern of the Party, the government, and Stalin personally for improving the living conditions of workers and staff. All measures must be taken to unconditionally complete this plan.
    The collective contract of the enterprise must include not only the expenditure items of public housing construction and housing repair reserve funds, but also the specific outlines of construction objects, major and current repairs, and assistance to private construction.
    The conclusion of the collective contract is the most important political and economic measure. Trade union organizations and management groups must prepare solemnly for the handling of this work, and must complete the conclusion of the collective contract within the deadline approved by the government.

　　集体合同是组织劳动高涨的重要手段
    苏联职工会主席  Ｖ·库兹涅佐夫
    苏联的职工会在部长会议赞助之下照往年成例从三月起与工业界、运输界和建筑界的企业的管理处着手缔结集体合同。
    集体合同应该成为工人、工程技术劳动者和职员等广大群众在解决党和政府提交我国人民的伟大任务的斗争里的创造性活动的组织手段。
    在战争年间和战后时期，企业里的工人的成份显著地更新了。在工业和运输方面加进了许多新的青年工人，他们都是初次参加生产的。需要有人帮助他们迅速获得社会主义劳动的经验。集体合同在这方面对于他们有很大的用处。
    在我们国家里，人们的劳动不是为了资本家，而是为了自己，为了自己的社会主义国家，为了全体人民的幸福：劳动成了光荣的、刚强的和英雄的事业。苏联人民以自我牺牲的劳动帮助我们的祖国赢得对不共戴天的敌人的全盘胜利，并从战争的艰苦的考炼里成为更强大更受锻炼的国家。
    我们国家的劳动者明白知道越好好地完成国家的工业计划，它的生产品越出得多，那么满足人民需要的商品供应量也越多。劳动者的物质生活状况的改善是和整个国民经济的增长，和我们的工业的与农业的发展分不开的。职工会的组织应该把这件事经常向工人和职员，尤其要向那些初次参加生产的工人们解释。
    有广大群众参加的集体合同的缔结和对合同中规定的义务的有系统的考核，无疑地可以提高工人们的积极性，帮助展开对于生产组织、劳动、工资等方面和对于工人与职员的生活和文化的设备的缺点方面的事务的批评，并迅速地消除这些缺点。
    党在它的决议中屡次强调集体合同的重大的意义，指出它是吸引一切工人和工作人员为完成和超过国家计划而作积极斗争的重要的组织手段。第十六次党大会的决议中要求在工人的集会上，对集体合同中最重要的部分作广泛的讨论。第十六次党大会的决议中说：“集体合同只有在被一切参加它的团体成员的广泛地讨论的过程中，每个工人才明白其中规定他们工资高低的和必须完成的任务的条款。只有在集体合同制定时以及它缔结的整个过程中成员的自觉的参加，既使一切工人熟悉了自己的生产状况和它在国民经济的一般系统里的任务，同时更对基于集体合同双方的义务上的生产与联合的坚固的纪律的实施给与了所必要的前提条件。”
    集体合同——这是管理处和作为工人集团的代表的工厂里职工会的委员会双方的义务。在我们的社会主义的国家里，在工人与经理之间没有也不可能有阶级的矛盾的。我们的集体合同和资本主义国家（那里的工人不得不向企业资本家作反对减低工资，延长工作时间，保持自己的生活水准和防御被剥削的斗争）的集体合同根本上的差别就在这个地方。在我们这方面，缔结集体合同的双方代表同属一个阶级，并且都追求着共同的目标，即：尽量扩大和推进社会主义的生产，提高劳动的生产力，而在这个基础上改善劳动者的物质的享受和文化的水准。
    在斯大林签署的部长会议的决议中指出：系用缔结集体合同的目的在于保证生产计划的完成与超过，劳动生产力进一步的发展，劳动组织的改善，以及提高经理部与职工会组织在改进劳动者的物质生活与文化设施的条件方面的责任。
    职工会负有重大的组织教育的工作。为了完成并超过五年计划必须显著地提高对一切部门的每个工人的工作限额，号召每个工人、工程师、技师与工作人员认真地完成课予他们的义务。集体合同无疑地将促成劳动纪律的加强，帮助进行对贪婪者与怠惰者，对那些供献给国家的有利工作很少而只想拚命抓钱的人的斗争。
    第十六次党大会的决议中指出：在签订集体合同以达到改善工人的，首先是工业无产阶级的物质与文化生活水准状况时，应该以发展全盘国民经济（工人国家的经济）的利益为出发点而最注意地研究产业的企业组合，经济联盟与企业等的情况。
    “在签订集体合同之下，职工会必须坚决地排除管理机关方面的官僚主义分子和职工会组织方面的狭隘车间主义与职工会主义的倾向。
    集体合同既是职工会组织与经理组织双方的义务，所以它的一切部分不仅应由经理组织来完成，也应当由工人团体组织实际地来完成的。”
    第十六次党大会的这些指示在目前具有重大的义意。
    我们国家已经跨进了新斯大林五年计划的第二年。一九四七年在苏联人民之前有着新的伟大的任务。为复兴被德国侵略者蹂躏过的区域并达到工业、运输与农业往后的增长，必须赶紧大踏步前进。
    我们具有完成这些任务的一切可能。庞大的贮备品隐藏在农业中。应该把他们动员起来，探求提高劳动生产力的新的可能性。
    集体合同首先应当包含有行政机关与作为工人团体代表的工厂中职工会的委员会双方关于完成与超出国家的制造生产品的计划的责任。一九四七年经政府批准的任务两方都受约束的。行政机关和工人委员会并且应该以下述观点为出发点，即：政府规定的计划是最低的任务，它可能而且应该超过的。
    重大的注意必须加之于：保证劳动生产力的发展的方策的拟订与实施；关于清除损失和不生产的消耗的问题；一切工人的制作标准的履行；解除妨害个别工人履行制作标准的原因；消灭工作停顿。在集体合同里应当包含采用和传播前进的工作方法的双方的义务，帮助落后的工人，把他们带到前进的水准上去。
    在集体合同中应该加进关于加强企业里发明的和合理化的工作的项目，采用发明家合理化家的建议并给他们以技术上的帮助，也同样帮助工厂里的工程技术工人从事科学研究的具体义务。
    拟订和讨论集体合同时，必须使工人、工程师、生产里的队长注意于支用原料与材料时的严格的节省，减少生产的废弃料和加强对于缺点的斗争等问题。因为在许多的企业里因缺点而损失的非常大，所以这问题就重要了。
    集体合同的缔结无疑地会引起企业中社会主义的竞赛的新的高潮。工厂委员会应当以集体合同的条件为根据来组织车间的、班的、突击队的以及个人的职业的竞赛，并保证竞赛的公开，鼓励它的胜利者。
    由列宁格勒人民和顿巴斯的矿工的倡导，目前以新的力量展开了钻掘工、坑工，纺织工的竞赛，以及不属同部管辖之下的同性质企业间的竞赛。职工会的和经理人员的组织必须支持这种倡导。
    大家知道，对于劳动工资的任何改变都得由政府决定。这一个程序在缔结集体合同之下也是有效的。可是管理处和职工会的组织对于工资方面不要因此而不做一事。他们的任务在于创造增进劳动生产力所必须的条件，于是因此而提高工资。所以在规定集体合同的任务时，首先必须注意企业里的工资的制额支付系统的尽量扩大，这是促进生产力最高度增加的办法。
    目前企业里和部里的劳动标准很低落。工作的经验统计的标准占着优势。在工作机械制造部的各工厂里，依据技术的标准总共只占百分之五，在机器制造和用具制造部的工厂中只有百分之十，在电气工业的企业里——百分之二十。重机器制造部规定一九四七年实行以技术为根据的标准也不过占一切标准总数的百分之三十四，还以为这是大的成就。
    经验统计的标准的优势会引起“有利的”与“不利的”工作出现，发生出熟练工人与不熟练工人的工资的均等，妨碍了劳动生产力的增长。这会常常引起这样的事：极大多数的工人都显著地超过了制造的标准，然而企业的生产计划还是没有完成。这种情形，譬如说在许多纺织工厂里就有。这种情形不能让它再存在了。
    按三月里政府的决议，许多部的制造标准应该向扩大方面修正。这样的标准应当刺激劳动生产力的增加，不断地驱使行政机关和工人改善工作，树立技术的最新的成就，改进劳动的组织。
    在集体合同里也应该找得到劳动保护，安全技术，减少患病率和伤残以及企业里劳动的一般的卫生设备条件——这是提高劳动生产力的重要因素——等问题的反映。
    为现有的与新成立的企业养成工人的与工程技术工人的干部的问题在集体合同中应该占有大的地位。这些问题里的严重的责任是落在行政机关和工厂集团双方的身上的。它们必须在集体合同中切实规定。
    工人和职员的生活的改善，流动性的减少和企业里的干部的加强大半要靠住宅问题的成功的解决——要靠新住宅的建筑和现有住宅的修理的计划的执行。然而一九四六年的住宅建筑计划没有完成，而政府所分配的材料很多没有应用。一九四六年的住宅建筑计划所有各部都完成不到百分之五十八，有几部更糟。
    政府批准了规模比一九四六年住宅建筑计划超过两倍大的一九四七年的住宅建筑计划，在城市和工人新村中一九四七年应当动工的住宅面积有一千三百八十万平方公尺。这是党、政府和斯大林个人的关于改善工人和职员的生活状况的极大关心的所在。必须采取一切方法来无条件地完成这一个计划。
    在企业的集体合同中必须包含的不但有公共住宅建筑和住宅修缮预备金的支出款项，还必须有建筑对象的具体的纲要，主要的与目前的修理，以及对于私人建筑予以帮助等。
    集体合同的缔结是最重大的政治经济的措施。职工会的组织和经理处团体对于这项工作的处理必须郑重准备，并且须在政府核准的限期内，完成集体合同的缔结。（附图片）
