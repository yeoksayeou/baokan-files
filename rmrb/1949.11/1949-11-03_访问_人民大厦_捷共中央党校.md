　　Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 2nd. Our correspondent recently visited the Central Party School of the Czechoslovak Communist Party located in an old building called "People's House" in the center of Prague. In 1912, Lenin convened the Sixth All-Russian Party Conference of the Bolsheviks in this building. After the February events of 1948, the Social Democratic Party merged with the Czechoslovak Communist Party, and the Central Party School moved to this historically significant building, which was a monastery two hundred years ago, occupied by nobles in the nineteenth century, and belonged to the Social Democratic Party at the beginning of the twentieth century.
    Before the new school year began on September 1st of this year, the Party School had already graduated one one-year class, two half-year classes, and seven three-month classes. By the end of August next year, there will be three more one-year classes, two half-year classes, and twelve three-month classes graduating. From September 1950, two-year classes will be added. The one-year classes are for training cadres for central, state, and regional party committees, national committees (local government organs), the army, public security, and propaganda work. The half-year classes are for training district-level cadres. The three-month classes are various specialized short-term training classes, such as finance and economics work training classes and agricultural movement work training classes. Local party committees above the district level all have three- to six-month training classes according to their needs, selecting cadres and promoting outstanding workers to study at the school.
    The courses for various classes at the Central Party School include the following: (1) Political Economy, (2) People's Democratic Politics, (3) History of the CPSU(B), (4) History of the Czechoslovak Workers' Movement (History of the Czechoslovak Communist Party and Modern History), (5) Party Building, (6) Two Camps (Current International Politics), (7) Dialectical Materialism, (8) Military Affairs and Geography, etc. The connection between theory and practice can be illustrated by the subject of Political Economy: the Political Economy course for the half-year class, in addition to the general theoretical part, also includes the tasks of the Czech Five-Year Economic Plan, its importance on the road to building socialism, the theory and methods of economic planning, the national budget, domestic and foreign trade, the forms of reducing and eliminating capitalist components in urban and rural areas, the forms and organization of socialist competition, and wage policies.
    When the reporter visited the Party School, he visited the relics of the Sixth Congress of the Bolshevik Party. In a small hall on the corner of the third floor, about twelve steps long and six steps wide, there is a desk and a back chair, which was where Lenin chaired the meeting at that time. Six small tables with faded yellow paint, divided into two rows with four equally old plank chairs, the interior furnishings are not only intact, but even the display is unchanged from that time. However, in the thirty-seven years since then, the victory of Marxism-Leninism has greatly changed the world.

　　访问“人民大厦”捷共中央党校
    【新华社布拉格二日电】记者顷访问位于布拉格市中心区一座名为“人民大厦”的古老建筑中的捷克共产党中央党校。一九一二年，列宁曾在这座大厦中召开了布尔什维克党的第六次全俄党代表会议。一九四八年二月事件后，社会民主党与捷共合并，中央党校就迁到这座在二百年前为修道院、十九世纪为贵族所据、二十世纪开始属于社会民主党的有历史意义的建筑中来。
    今年九月一日开始新学年以前，党校已有一个一年班、两个半年班、七个三个月班毕业，到明年八月底，又将有三个一年班、两个半年班、十二个三个月班毕业。从一九五零年九月起，将要增设为期两年的班次。一年班是培养中央、州和地委机关、民族委员会（地方政权机关）、军队、治安及宣传工作干部的，半年班是培养区级干部的，三个月班是各种的专门短期训练班，如财经工作训练班，农运工作训练班等。地委以上的地方党委，均依照需要设有三个月至六个月的训练班，抽调干部与提拔优秀工人入校学习。
    中央党校各种班次的课程计有如下几项：（一）政治经济学，（二）人民民主政治，（三）联共党史，（四）捷克斯洛伐克工人运动史（捷共党史与近代史），（五）党的建设，（六）两个阵营（目前国际政治），（七）辩证唯物论，（八）军事与地理等。理论与实际联系的情形，可从政治经济学一科来说明：半年班的政治经济学，讲题中除了一般理论的部分以外，还包括捷克五年经济计划的任务，其在建设社会主义路上的重要性，经济计划的理论与方法，国家预算，国内与国外贸易，削减与排除城乡资本主义成份的形式，社会主义竞赛的形式与组织，工资政策等问题。
    记者访问党校时，曾参观了布尔什维克党六次会议的遗物。三层楼角上的一间长约十二步、宽可六步的小厅里，摆着一张写字台，一个靠背椅，那就是当时列宁主持会议的位子。六张土黄色微微褪了漆的小桌，分作两排各有四把同样古老的板椅，室内陈设不仅完好无缺，连陈列的样子也照当时没有改变，但是，三十七年来，马列主义的胜利，已将世界大大地改变了。
