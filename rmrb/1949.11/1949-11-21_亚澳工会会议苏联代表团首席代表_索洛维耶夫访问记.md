　　Interview with Comrade Soloviev, Chief Representative of the Soviet Delegation to the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference

[Our Dispatch] Yesterday, our reporter interviewed Comrade Soloviev, the chief representative of the Soviet delegation attending the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference, Executive Member of the World Federation of Trade Unions, and one of the chairmen of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions of the Soviet Union. Comrade Soloviev first introduced the main work of the Soviet trade unions in the post-war Five-Year Plan for economic construction. He said: "To restore and develop the national economy, and to complete the post-war Five-Year Plan in four years, is the central task of the Soviet trade unions. Currently, the first task of the Soviet trade unions is to organize a nationwide socialist emulation campaign. This competition is carried out on an industry-by-industry basis. In the competition, every worker and every enterprise undertakes a specific socialist emulation task, which not only involves completing and exceeding the production plan in terms of quantity, but also ensuring the improvement of production quality, saving raw materials, protecting tools, and reducing costs. In the socialist emulation campaign of the post-war Five-Year Plan, a large number of activists have emerged among both staff and workers, and many new working methods have been created. For example, Comrade Belyukov, a metalworker, improved his working methods and increased his metal cutting efficiency tenfold. Technical innovators are being discovered everywhere in Soviet state industrial departments. One of the important tasks of the trade unions is to disseminate these new creations in production to the broad masses of workers in various enterprises, so that the new inventions and rationalization proposals of the working masses can be widely promoted. The winners of the socialist emulation campaign are judged and rewarded by the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions and various industrial departments." Comrade Soloviev emphasized: "Due to the inherent characteristics of the Soviet system, workers can develop the highest level of awareness. Because of this, Stalin's post-war Five-Year Plan is proceeding victoriously, and it is believed that the Soviet people will be able to complete it in four years."

Comrade Soloviev mentioned that the Soviet trade unions often help the administrative authorities of factories and the staff and workers to conclude collective contracts. He said: The main content of the collective contract is that, on the one hand, the trade union guarantees the completion of the factory's production plan; on the other hand, the factory guarantees the improvement of the workers' living conditions, such as the establishment of nurseries and kindergartens, the construction of clubs, sanatoriums, and other facilities to improve workers' lives. The implementation of these collective contracts has strengthened the better development of production and construction.

When talking about how Soviet trade unions conduct cultural and political education for workers, Soloviev said: "The task in this area is to raise the technical level of workers to the level of technical personnel. Through cultural palaces, clubs, and libraries, lectures and reports on various specialized topics are conducted, and various technical research groups are organized to improve the workers' proficiency." Comrade Soloviev particularly mentioned that the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions has also done a lot of work in the area of workers' recuperation and medical treatment in the years since the war. In 1949, 2.5 million workers went to the Caucasus and Crimea for recuperation through the trade unions, some of whom only had to pay 30 percent of the cost themselves, and some of whom could enjoy completely free preferential treatment.

Finally, Comrade Soloviev expressed his gratitude to the Chinese people for their warm welcome and reception of the Soviet delegation. He said: "The friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples is very natural. The Soviet Union has always expressed deep sympathy for the heroic struggle of the Chinese people. There is no doubt that the friendship between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union will continue to develop and be consolidated."

　　亚澳工会会议苏联代表团首席代表
　　索洛维耶夫访问记
    【本报讯】记者昨日访问了出席亚澳工会会议的苏联代表团首席代表、世界工联执行委员、苏联总工会主席之一——索洛维耶夫同志。索洛维耶夫同志首先介绍了苏联职工会在进行战后五年计划经济建设中主要的工作情形。他说：“恢复与发展国民经济，把战后的五年计划，做到在四年内完成，是目前苏联职工会的中心任务。现在，苏联职工会的工作第一个是组织全国的社会主义竞赛。此种竞赛以产业部门为单位来进行。在竞赛中，每一个工人，每一个企业，都承担了一定的社会主义竞赛的任务，这任务不仅是从量的方面要完成和超过生产计划，而且要保证生产成品的提高和节省原料、爱护工具以减低成本。在战后五年计划的社会主义竞赛中，无论是职员和工人，都在生产中涌现了大批积极分子，并产生了很多新的工作方法。例如金属工人别留可夫同志，由于改进了工作方法，他割切金属的效率比原来提高了十倍。在技术方面的革新家，苏联国家工业部门到处都有发现。职工会的重要任务之一，就是把生产中的新的创造散布到各企业的广大群众中去，以使工人群众的新的发明和合理化建议能够得到广泛的推行。社会主义竞赛的优胜者，则由苏联职工会和各工业部门评判总结给予奖励。索洛维耶夫同志强调的说：“由于苏维埃制度本身具有的特点，工人们才能产生最高的觉悟性，因为这样，斯大林战后建设的五年计划正在胜利进行中，相信苏联人民能在四年中把它完成。”
    索洛维耶夫同志谈到苏联职工会经常帮助各厂行政当局和职员工人订立集体合同。他说：集体合同的主要内容一方面是工会保证工厂生产计划的完成；另一方面是工厂保证改善工人的生活条件，如设立托儿所、幼稚院，建筑俱乐部、休养所和其他改善工人生活的设备，这些集体合同的执行加强了生产建设更好的发展。
    谈到苏联职工会如何对于工人进行文化政治教育时，索洛维耶夫说：“这方面的任务是要把工人的技术水平提高到技术人员的水平，通过文化宫、俱乐部、图书馆，进行各种专门问题的讲演和报告，并组织各种技术研究小组，以提高工人工作的熟练程度。”索洛维耶夫同志特别提到：苏联总工会在战后几年以来，对于工人休养医疗方面也做了很多工作，在一九四九年中，通过职工会去高加索、克里米亚疗养的工人已达二百五十万人，其中有的自己只需付出百分之三十的费用，有的则可完全享受免费的优待。
    最后，索洛维耶夫同志对于中国人民热诚欢迎招待苏联代表团表示感谢。他说：“中国人民和苏联人民的友谊是很自然的。苏联对于中国人民英勇的斗争一贯表示了深切的同情。毫无疑义，中苏两大民族的友谊一定会日益发展与巩固起来。”
