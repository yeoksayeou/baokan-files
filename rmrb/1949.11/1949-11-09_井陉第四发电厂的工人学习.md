　　Workers' Study at Jingxing No. 4 Power Plant
　　Wu Dianrong
　　The workers at the Fengshan No. 4 Power Plant in Jingxing are diligently studying politics, technology, culture, and other subjects on a voluntary basis. In classrooms and machine rooms, they are learning anytime, anywhere, using their spare time. They also study with their children at home, which is a rare enthusiasm in schools.

　　Through study, the workers have sparked a production upsurge, saving a large amount of materials and reducing the cost of electricity generation. The cost of coal per kilowatt-hour has been reduced from 1.9 kilograms to 1.24 kilograms. Because their political consciousness has been unprecedentedly raised, the workers have taken on the attitude of masters to manage their own factory. Take the current implementation of the democratization movement as an example: more than 90 people in the factory put forward 106 constructive suggestions, with only seven related to welfare, fully demonstrating the selfless spirit of the working class. Therefore, to run a people's enterprise well, it is necessary to improve the workers' study, especially political study.

　　However, this achievement is not accidental, but the result of a tortuous road.

　　The most troublesome problem is that there are many workers here, scattered in nearby villages. Before their awareness was raised, they thought it was a waste of time, because they had to go home to farm after work. Other problems, such as different working hours (mostly shift work), teachers, and teaching materials, followed. After the power company was unified under leadership in March (formerly under the Jingxing Mining Bureau), the main task was to organize study and educate employees, but facing all kinds of difficulties, what way to educate them?

　　In May, leading cadres seized the opportunity of dismantling and repairing the No. 3 generator to launch union groups to discuss whether they needed to study. As a result, they answered that they wanted to learn theory, learn the basic theoretical knowledge of air pressure, vacuum, and operation. So it was decided to learn technology first, and two engineers, Liang and Shen, were hired as lecturers, using the large class approach. This continued for three weeks. Although the lecturers tried to avoid mathematical formulas and only introduced simple principles, they were sweating profusely. However, because of the different levels of the workers, their cultural and mathematical foundations were too poor (half of them were illiterate), only about 30% could understand. Gradually, fewer and fewer people came, some even wanted to sleep. Both sides were not interested, and it finally collapsed.

　　The reasons for this failure were summarized as follows: (1) The workers' demands were too high, and they were too impatient. (2) No specific investigation of the actual situation was conducted beforehand. (3) No central backbone active in learning was found. (4) The large class approach should not have been adopted.

　　In response to the above shortcomings, an enlarged cadre meeting was held to conduct a review, and union groups were mobilized to discuss and educate employees with the lessons learned from this failure. Later, it was decided to start by investigating the workers' level, printing out questionnaires, and inviting ten workers who were enthusiastic about learning to assist in the work. According to the level of education and working hours, they were divided into four groups; three cultural classes (arithmetic and literacy) per week, one political class, and one singing class. Workers in the repair department studied one more arithmetic class every day. Cadres were assigned as teachers (we came to the No. 4 factory for internship at the end of July and assisted the factory cadres in teaching in early August). The union bought many slate pencils, slates, diaries, pencils, workers' literacy textbooks, etc.

　　Thus began the second study, which went surprisingly smoothly, with an unusually high enthusiasm for learning, and everyone had confidence in learning. Illiterate old workers were required to learn two to four characters every day; technical classes took the form of informal discussions, discussing methods of handling steam turbine boiler failures, exchanging experiences, and combining practice to study the balancing test method of the No. 3 motor that was being overhauled. Everyone became interested in learning.

　　At the end of June, the Youth League officially went public with its organization, playing a backbone and core role in learning. Under the slogan of respecting teachers and loving students, it united and encouraged the older masters. Youth League member Zhang Guiqing automatically went to the factory every night to find teachers to make up arithmetic; Yang Fengxiao and Gao Xuanying used their coal breaking rest time to write characters on iron plates; the old masters of the repair department, Liu Zhanshan, Qu Rui, etc., wrote application nouns such as "lathe" and "milling machine" whenever they had time; the old workers of the boiler turbine practiced writing the labels on the signal lights such as "load increase" and "now good". In short, it was all stuff that could be used after learning. In addition, the teachers also regularly held joint meetings to review shortcomings and exchange teaching experiences. Instructor Yang Wanyi called on everyone to first "examine themselves, and don't complain that others are backward and not progressing. Who doesn't want to learn well?" Therefore, the teachers constantly improved their teaching methods, using the weapon of self-criticism to improve themselves. The head of the general affairs section personally explored their difficulties and helped them solve them. Therefore, the enthusiasm of the workers was further increased. Up to now, strong winds and heavy rains cannot stop their learning.

　　The following experiences were gained by summarizing this learning work:

　　(1) When organizing learning, we should focus on enlightenment and education. It should be voluntary, not forced. Political classes are best added after a period of time, and the impetuosity of a small number of young workers should be appropriately corrected.

　　(2) Establishment of a system; Establish an examination system, reward those with excellent grades, and encourage those with poor grades; On a voluntary basis, establish an attendance system; But these systems should not be rushed, they should be held after the learning enthusiasm has progressed to a certain extent.

　　(3) Combining learning with work: For example, when taking arithmetic classes, don't rely solely on books, they should be able to use what they learn immediately after they finish studying. Such as the calculation of volume, how to calculate horsepower, calculate electricity consumption, and how many buckets can be made from a sheet of iron, etc. When annotating new words for workers in literacy class, teachers should patiently explain and implement a democratic approach, encouraging everyone to put forward more opinions.

　　井陉第四发电厂的工人学习
    吴殿荣
    井陉凤山第四发电厂的工友们，在自觉自愿地基础上，努力地学习着政治、技术、文化等课程。在课室、在机房，随时随地利用工作余暇来进行学习。回到家里也和他们的孩子们在一起学习，这种情绪在学校中是罕见的。
    通过了学习，工友们掀起了生产的热潮，节省下大批的材料，降低了发电成本，使每度电需煤一·九公斤的成本降低到一·二四公斤；因为政治觉悟空前地提高，工友们都拿出主人翁的姿态来管理自己的工厂，就以目前贯彻民主化运动来说吧：全厂九十多个人提出一百○六条建设性的意见，福利一项仅仅七条，充分地发挥了工人阶级大公无私的精神。因此要想搞好人民的企业，就必须搞好工人的学习，首先是政治学习。
    但是这种成绩并不是偶然得来的，而是经过一段曲折的道路的。
    最麻烦的问题，就是此地工人多，分散居住在附近乡村。在他们的觉悟尚未提高以前，他们认为这是浪费光阴的事情，因为下班后他们还要回家去种地。其他如工作时间的不同（多系运转班），师资、教材等等问题都接踵而来。三月间，电灯公司统一领导之后（从前归井陉矿），主要的任务就是组织学习，教育职工，但是面临着的种种困难，用什么方式去教育呢？
    五月间领导干部抓住拆修三号发电机的机会，发动工会各小组讨论是否需要学习，结果有了答复，就是要学理论，学习气压真空、以及运转上的基本理论知识。于是就决定了先学技术，聘请梁沈二位工程师担任讲师，采取上大课的方式，这样继续了三个星期。虽然讲师尽量避免数学公式，只介绍浅近的原理，累的满头大汗，但是因为工人程度的不同，文化和数学的根基太差（有二分之一是文盲），听得懂的只有十分之三，于是人渐渐少了，有的直想睡觉，双方都不感兴趣，终于垮台了。
    总结此次失败的原因：（一）工人要求过高，犯了急性病。（二）事先没有具体的调查实际情况。（三）没有发现学习积极的中心骨干。（四）不应采取上大课的方式。
    针对以上缺点，召开了扩大干部会议，进行检讨，并发动工会各小组讨论，拿此次失败的教训教育职工。后来决定先开始调查工人的程度，印出征求意见书，并请出十位对学习热心的工人协助工作。按照文化程度、工作时间的不同，编成四组；每周三堂文化课（算术与识字），一堂政治，一堂唱歌，修理股工人每天多学习一堂算术；由干部分担教员（我们是七月底来到四厂实习，八月初配合厂方干部教课）。并由工会买了许多石笔、石板、日记本、铅笔、工人识字课本等等。
    这样便开始了第二次学习，出乎意外地顺利，学习情绪异常高涨，都对学习有了信心。不识字的老工人每天规定学两个至四个字；技术课采取漫谈方式，讨论汽机锅炉故障处理办法，交流经验并结合实际研究正在大检修中三号电机找平衡的试验法等。大家对学习都发生了兴趣。
    六月末青年团正式公开了组织，对学习起了骨干和核心作用。在尊师爱徒的口号下，团结并鼓励了年老的师傅们。青年团员张贵清每晚自动到厂内找教员补习算术；杨凤小、高宣英利用砸煤休息时间在铁板上写字；修理股的老师傅刘占山、曲瑞更等一有功夫就写“旋床”“铣床”等应用名词；锅炉汽机的老工人练习写“负荷增加”“现在良好”等信号灯上的标帜。总之，都是学了就能用的东西。此外教员们也经常地开联席会议，检讨缺点，互相交流教学经验。指导员杨万益号召大家首先要“检讨自己，不要怨别人落后不进步，谁不想学好呢？”因此教员们经常地改进教学方法，用自我批评的武器来提高自己，总务股长并亲自发掘他们的困难，帮助他们解决。因此工友们的情绪更提高了。到现在刮大风下大雨也阻止不了他们的学习。
    总结这次学习工作，获得以下几点经验：
    （一）组织学习时，应该着重启发教育工作，应该是自愿的，而不应采取强迫方式。政治课最好过一个时间再添，要适当纠正少数青年工人的急性病。
    （二）制度的建立；建立考试制度，奖励成绩优良者，鼓励成绩不好的；在自愿的基础上，建立考勤制度；但这些制度不要操之过急，应该等到学习情绪进展到一定程度后才举行。
    （三）学习与工作结合：如上算术课不要单纯依靠书本，应该使他们学完后即能用。如体积的计算、怎样计算马力、计算用电量，以及一张铁板能作几个水桶等等。上识字课给工人注解生字时教员要耐心地解释，并须贯彻民主方式，鼓励大家多提意见。
