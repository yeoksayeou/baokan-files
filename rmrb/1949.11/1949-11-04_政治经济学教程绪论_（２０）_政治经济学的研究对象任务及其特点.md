    Social Economic Movement
    From a historical perspective, social economic movement is firstly a long-term economic movement, that is, a social economic movement from the perspective of the long-term development of society; secondly, it is a social economic movement of each era, that is, a social economic movement of each historical era of social development; and finally, it is a social economic movement in each development stage of an era. Their general characteristic is development from a lower level to a higher level.
    From the perspective of the entire long-term history of human social development, that is, from the time there has been human social history, human social economy has basically experienced (and some are still experiencing) five economic forms: the economy of primitive communist society, the economy of ancient society, the economy of feudal society, the economy of capitalist society, and the economy of socialist society. Later, it will move towards the social economic form of advanced communism (China also experienced colonial, semi-colonial, and semi-feudal social economy, and is now realizing a new democratic social economy; in colonial societies, the colonial economy is still being experienced). The development movement of each social economy towards another social economy, that is, the development movement from one historical era of society to another, is basically a development movement from a lower level to a higher level. Therefore, from the perspective of the long-term trend of social economic development movement, it is a development movement from a lower level to a higher level. Each historical era of social economic development, or the social economy of each historical era, also has its own development history, and is replaced by another higher-level historical era of social economy, such as the economy of ancient society replacing the economy of primitive communist society, the economy of feudal society replacing the economy of ancient society, and the economy of capitalist society replacing the economy of feudal society. This transition from one social economy to another higher-level social economy also marks the progress of social development from one historical era to another. And the social economy of each historical era is composed of several different development stages, with its history of emergence, establishment, development, and decline, and all are developing from a lower level to a higher level (of course, there are also individual stages of stagnation and regression). The economic movements of these different development stages are like flowing rivers, wave after wave, each wave following the previous, developing forward at different speeds, converging into a stream of social economic movement of an era, and the streams of economic movement of each era converge into the great torrent of long-term social economic movement of the entire history. In this way, social economy is continuously and ceaselessly moving, developing, from a lower level to a higher level, from backwardness to progress, which promotes human society to also continuously develop and progress, from a lower level to a higher level, from backwardness to progress. This is the trend of human social development.
    In a certain period, people's economic activities, in a commodity economy, are various activities of people revolving around production, exchange, distribution, and consumption, that is, people's activities in the processes of production, exchange, distribution, and consumption of material means of livelihood. In a self-sufficient economy, people's economic activities are various activities of people revolving around production, distribution, and consumption. The movement of production, distribution, and consumption in a self-sufficient economy, and the movement of production, exchange, distribution, and consumption in a commodity economy, are what we call economic movement. They all begin with production, which is fundamental and dominant.
    The Error of Idealizing Primitive Communist Society Economy
    Utopian socialists and some political economy instructors in recent times, in violation of the principle of historical materialism that "a certain form of production relations is determined by the specific nature of productive forces" (Marx: Preface to Critique of Political Economy), have idealized primitive communist society and praised it vigorously. Of course, the collective life of common production and common distribution and the social system without exploitation in primitive communist society are ideal, but they do not know that the productive forces at that time were extremely low and extremely naive, and people's power to fight against nature was also very weak. Therefore, the production method at that time, from the perspective of the stage of historical development, was also the lowest-level form in the history of human society. They do not know that the collective mode of production in primitive communist society was the result of weak individual power, not the result of the socialization of the means of production. That is to say, primitive communist society was established on the basis of extremely weak productive forces, that is, on the basis of extremely underdeveloped means of production and extremely weak individual power, rather than on the basis of the socialization of progressive or highly developed means of production. Therefore, it is not comparable to the modern socialist economy and the future advanced communist economy. Therefore, the replacement of the economy of primitive communist society by the economy of ancient society is a development from a lower to a higher stage in the history of social economic development, and has a progressive nature and significance.
    The Imbalance of Social Economic Development
    The economy of a society, in various countries and regions, and even in various regions within a country, develops unevenly due to different specific economic and political conditions, and the speed of economic movement is also inconsistent, with some developing faster and some developing slower. For example, the imbalance in the development of modern Chinese social economy is the most significant example. From the perspective of the entire stage of modern Chinese social economic development, it lags behind the capitalist economy of Britain and the United States by one era, and lags behind the socialist economy of the Soviet Union by two eras. From the perspective of the characteristics of the modern Chinese social economic structure, modern China has six economies or economic structures: the imperialist economy, the bureaucratic capitalist economy, the feudal and semi-feudal economy, the national capitalist economy, and the remnants of the slave system economy and the remnants of the primitive communist society economy. Together, they form the semi-colonial and semi-feudal social economic structure of modern China. These six economies not only occupy different positions and play different roles in the entire Chinese economy, but also their development in various regions is imbalanced due to economic, political, and other conditions. For example, in the entire modern Chinese economy, the imperialist economy, the feudal and semi-feudal economy, and their connection—the bureaucratic capitalist economy—clearly occupy a dominant and ruling position. In various regions, the proportion of various economic components is also imbalanced due to political, transportation, and other factors. For example, in cities and coastal transportation and along railway lines, imperialist, bureaucratic capitalist, and capitalist economic components occupy a prominent and dominant position. In rural areas, especially in remote rural areas with inconvenient transportation, feudal and semi-feudal economic components occupy an obvious advantage. As for remote provinces, especially among ethnic minorities, there are still remnants of the slave system economy, and even the remnants of the primitive communist society economy. However, in China's capitalist production, there are still feudal and slave system exploitation relations.
    Due to the imbalance of economic development in modern China, an imbalance in the political development of modern China was produced, and therefore the imbalance of the development of the Chinese revolution, that is, the possibility of the revolution first winning in the countryside, was produced. That is, the focus of the revolution is first in the countryside, first gathering strength in the countryside, using the countryside to surround the cities, defeat the cities, and seize the cities. Now this period has obviously come to an end, and a new historical period of going from the cities to the countryside and leading the countryside from the cities has begun. However, since 1927, for the past twenty-two years, this characteristic of the Chinese revolution is obviously basically due to the imbalance of modern Chinese social economic development, and the imbalance of the Chinese political structure caused by the imbalance of social economic development. It is the great result of Comrade Mao Zedong applying the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism to analyze the characteristics of Chinese social economy and leading the Chinese revolution. He, along with Lenin, based on the analysis of the law of uneven development of capitalism, came to the conclusion that the proletarian revolution first has the possibility of victory in one country, thereby obtaining the great victory of the Russian October Socialist Revolution under his leadership, and the great victory of the subsequent Soviet socialist construction, are the great creations and victories of Marxism-Leninism, with equally immortal merits.

　　第三节　经济运动与经济运动规律（法则）
    社会经济运动
    社会经济运动，从历史上来看，首先是长时期的经济运动，也就是从社会长期发展的历史来看的社会经济运动；其次便是一个时代一个时代的社会经济运动，也就是各个社会发展的历史时代的社会经济运动；最后，便是一个时代里各个发展阶段中的社会经济运动。它们总的特点，都是由低级向高级的运动发展。
    从整个的长期的人类社会发展的历史来考察，即是从自有人类社会历史以来考察，人类社会经济基本上已经历了（有的还在经历着）原始共产社会的经济、古代社会的经济、封建社会的经济、资本主义社会的经济与社会主义社会的经济等五种经济形式，以后还要走向高级共产主义的社会经济形式（在中国还经历了殖民地、半殖民地、半封建的社会经济，今天正实现着新民主主义的社会经济；在殖民地社会里，则至今还经历着殖民地的经济），每一种社会经济向另一种社会经济的发展运动，即从社会历史的这一时代向另一时代的发展运动；基本上都是由低级向高级发展运动的。所以从长期的社会经济发展运动的趋势来说，它是由低级向高级发展运动的。每一个社会经济发展的历史时代，或每一个历史时代的社会经济，也都是各自有它的发展历史，并由另一个较高级历史时代的社会经济来代替的历史，例如古代社会的经济之代替原始共产社会的经济，封建社会的经济之代替古代社会经济，资本主义社会的经济之代替封建社会经济。这种由一种社会经济向另一种较高级的社会经济转进，也就是标志着社会发展由一个历史时代向另一个历史时代的进展。而每一个历史时代的社会经济，又由若干不同的发展阶段所构成，有其发生、成立、发展、衰亡的历史，也都是由低级向高级运动发展的（当然也有个别的停滞倒退的阶段）。这些不同发展阶段的经济运动好象川流一样，一波逐一波，一浪随一浪，各以不同的速度向前发展运动，汇成一个时代社会经济运动之流，而各个时代的经济运动之流，又汇成整个历史的长期的社会经济运动的巨流。社会经济便是这样连续不断川流不息地运动着，发展着，由低级向高级，由落后向进步，它推动着人类社会也连续不断地发展进步，由低级向高级，由落后向进步。这便是人类社会发展的趋向。
    在一定时期中人们的经济活动，在商品经济里，就是人们围绕着贯穿着生产、交换、分配、消费的诸种活动，即人们在物质生活资料的生产、交换、分配与消费诸过程中的活动。在自给自足的经济里，人们的经济活动，则是人们围绕着贯穿着生产、分配、消费的诸种活动。在自给自足经济里生产、分配、消费的运动，在商品经济中生产、交换、分配、消费的运动，就是我们所说的经济运动。它们都以生产为开端、为基本、为主导。
    对原始共产社会经济理想化的错误
    空想的社会主义者和挽近某些政治经济学的讲授上，违背了历史唯物论“生产关系的一定形式，是由生产力的特定性质所决定的。”（马克思：政治经济学批判序言）这一原则，把原始共产社会理想化了，极力地加以赞美。固然原始共产社会的共同生产，共同分配的集体生活与没有剥削的社会制度是理想的，但是他们不知道那时的生产力是极其低微，极其幼稚的，人们对自然斗争的力量也是很薄弱。因此当时的生产方式，从历史的发展阶段上来看，也是人类社会有史以来最低级的形式。他们不知道原始共产社会集体的生产方式，是个人力量薄弱的结果，而不是生产手段社会化了的结果。这也就是说原始共产社会是建立在生产力极其薄弱，即建立在生产手段极不发达，个人的力量极薄弱的基础上，而不是建立在进步的或高度发展的生产手段社会化的基础上的。因此它与现代的社会主义经济与将来的高级共产主义经济是不可同日而语的。所以原始共产社会经济以后被古代社会经济所代替，从社会经济发展的历史上说来，是由低级的向较高一级的阶段发展，是具有进步的性质和意义的。
    社会经济发展的不平衡性
    一个社会的经济，在各个国家各个地区内，甚至在一个国家内的各个地区里，由于具体的经济政治条件的不同，经济的发展也是不平衡的，同时经济运动的速度也是不相一致的，有的发展快，有的发展慢。例如：近代中国社会经济发展的不平衡，便是最显著的例证。从整个近代中国社会经济的发展阶段来说，较之英美资本主义经济是落后一个时代，较之苏联社会主义经济更是落后两个时代。而从近代中国社会经济结构特点来看，近代中国存在着帝国主义经济，官僚资本主义的经济，封建的与半封建的经济，民族资本主义的经济，以及奴隶制经济的残余，与原始共产社会经济的残余等六种经济或经济结构，它们总起来，形成着近代中国半殖民地半封建的社会经济结构。而这六种经济不但在中国整个经济中所占的地位作用不同，而且它们在各地区的发展，也是由于经济的、政治的、以及其他诸种条件而不平衡的。例如：在整个近代中国经济中，帝国主义经济，封建的与半封建的经济和它们两者的联结物——官僚资本主义经济显然是占着支配的统治的地位。而在各个地区内，则由于政治、交通等等关系，各种经济成份所占地位比重又是不平衡的。例如在城市与沿海交通、铁路沿线，帝国主义的、官僚资本主义的，以及资本主义的经济成份占着显著的支配地位。而在乡村里，特别是在交通不便的僻远的乡村里，则封建的与半封建的经济成份占着显然的优势。至于在僻远的省份中特别是少数民族中，还有着奴隶制的经济残余，甚至于原始共产社会经济残余的存在，而在中国资本主义的生产中，却也还存在着封建的与奴隶制的榨取关系。
    由于近代中国经济发展的不平衡，因此，又产生了近代中国政治发展的不平衡，并因此而产生了中国革命发展的不平衡性，即革命有在乡村首先胜利的可能性。即革命重点先在乡村，先在乡村中聚集力量，用乡村包围城市，战胜城市，夺取城市。现在这一时期显然已经完结，而开始了由城市到乡村，并由城市领导乡村的新的历史时期。可是自一九二七年起，二十二年以来中国革命的这一特点，显然基本地是由于中国近代社会经济发展的不平衡，及由于社会经济发展的不平衡而产生的中国政治结构的不平衡所产生的。是毛泽东同志运用马列主义的普遍真理，分析中国社会经济特点，领导中国革命的伟大的结果。他与列宁根据对资本主义发展的不平衡律的分析，得出无产阶级革命首先有在一国内胜利的可能性的结论，从而在他的领导下获得了伟大的俄国十月社会主义革命的胜利，与以后苏联社会主义建设的伟大胜利是马列主义伟大的创造与胜利，具有同等的不朽的功绩的。
