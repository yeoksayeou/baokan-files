　　People's River Management Versus "River Governor's" River Management
　　Zhang Hanying
　　When I arrived in Kaifeng in late June, the flood control meeting convened by the Yellow River Conservancy Commission was about to end. I heard that this year's flood control task was to "ensure that when the Yellow River water flow at Shan County rises to 16,000 cubic meters per second, the downstream dikes will not breach." This surprised and worried me greatly, while also revealing some hope. The Shan County station has been observing the Yellow River water flow for thirty years, and there are records of its rise, fall, and quantity. A flow of 16,000 cubic meters per second would be nearly the fourth highest level ever recorded. According to past breach statistics, when Shan County reached 10,000 cubic meters per second, the probability of downstream dike breaches was 75 percent. 16,000 is much higher than 10,000, so how could they dare to make such a bold guarantee? Were they not being responsible to the people? Moreover, after the Yellow River returned to its original course, only two major floods had passed. The riverbed had been silted up for many years, the dikes were dilapidated, and it was also a time of supporting the front lines, with the Liberation War actively underway. Would there be such great manpower and material resources to manage and repair it? I was very worried about this promise!
　　I gradually read through the Yellow River work plans, reports, and summaries. From here, I discovered many new things. Compared to the old ones, the content and spirit appeared more distinct, active, and vibrant. Therefore, I gradually began to hope for river management. I was not just reading these documents, but also starting to learn from them. However, it was difficult to gain a practical and profound understanding from written knowledge alone, and I only gained some concepts. Soon, the major flood arrived, and I also experienced the actual situation, gaining a further understanding of the current river management situation.
　　In early July, the first flood arrived, and the flow at Shan County reached 7,000 cubic meters per second. At this time, only a few projects on the downstream dikes experienced collapse. In late July, we encountered the second flood, and the flow at Shan County reached 15,400 cubic meters per second. I thought the test had arrived. Naturally, all sections raised their vigilance, working day and night, but we still passed safely. Seeing such calm and unhurried, composed responses, with a confident air, was truly unexpected. In the past, such a large flood would have caused chaos, and the people of Kaifeng would not have been able to sleep peacefully. After this flood, I had to change my view of the Yellow River and re-evaluate its power.
　　At this time, we were drafting the work plan for next year. Shandong Province proposed that next year's flood control target would be a flow of 13,000 cubic meters per second at Luokou, which was Luokou's largest record in 1937. It was also the largest record since observations began. Pingyuan Province believed that next year's flood control should take a step forward, with a target of 18,000 cubic meters per second, which was the third highest record at Shan County. I was very excited. This active and responsible approach gave me great hope and encouragement. Since the Yellow River has had repairs and defenses, although there have been theoretical plans, no one has ever dared to make such a firm and progressive guarantee. This is truly a new era in the history of the Yellow River. This is the desire of the people for thousands of years; due to the oppression, exploitation, and enslavement by the ruling class in the past, and one disaster after another, they did not dare to have this idea. They only hoped to reduce some exploitation and oppression, and they would be satisfied. If they were given some leftovers or benefits to win people's hearts, the people would feel "imperial grace is mighty" and "a prosperous age," and would not dare to harbor extravagant hopes? Now that the people have turned themselves over, they can express their wishes, and they can truly freely, bravely, and diligently realize this wish. Don't believe it? There was further proof immediately!
　　From late August, the sky was overcast. Although the rain was not heavy, it rained for more than twenty days, and the water of the Yellow River gradually rose. This time, the maximum water level in Shan County was not as high as the last time, but the duration was very long. The riverbed in Henan Province is very wide, but in Pingyuan Province and Shandong Province, the distance between the dikes gradually narrowed. This is a deformed dike facility on the Yellow River. If the water flow in Shan County rose and fell quickly, then some water would be retained in the channel of the Henan section, which would reduce the threat to the downstream. If the water flow continued to not decrease, this effect would be reduced, and Pingyuan and Shandong would be in danger. This time, the water flow in Shan County continued to be above 10,000 cubic meters per second for one hundred hours, exceeding all records, and it can be said to be the most sustained flood. The total amount of floodwater with a flow rate of more than 5,000 cubic meters per second was 3.5 billion cubic meters, which was higher than the largest flood total in 1933 on record. Therefore, it can be said that although this flood was not the highest, the total amount of floodwater was the largest on record. The Luokou flow also caught up with the 1937 record. This test was great. In the Shouzhang area alone, there were more than thirty leaks, and the water on the top of the dike was only half a meter. As a result, Pingyuan Province alone had 120,000 people and 5,000 cadres on the dike, fighting relentlessly against the Yellow River day and night in the wind and rain. Although there were two breaches in the people's embankment on the north bank of Shouzhang and the people's embankment in Liangshan on the south bank, we finally won the victory of defending the dikes, preserving the lives and property of millions of people. This was impossible in the past! Even if there were so many people on the dike, there could not have been so many cadres, and it would have been just a mob, each with their own agenda. Under oppression, coercion, and selfish individualism, such an achievement would have been impossible. Now the people are awakened, and everyone is embracing each other. With the same feeling as saving their own home from fire, millions of people working together, what can't be overcome? As the saying goes, "Two people with the same heart, their strength can break gold." Moreover, what about the current millions of people? Is it still unbelievable to say that they have the power to realize their wishes? Conversely, can it be considered excessive to say that most of the previous breaches were due to human causes?
　　People's river management is different from the river management of the ruling class. In the past, the ruling class's river management was fundamentally irresponsible to the people. Except for using river management to achieve promotion and wealth to satisfy personal desires, too few people truly worked for the country and the people. Even the best of them held a charitable heart or wanted to win people's hearts to consolidate their own position. Occasionally, due to efforts in this direction, some achievements were made, creating a "prosperous age," becoming "able ministers," and the people also felt that it had nothing to do with them, but only consolidated the position of a few people and satisfied the desires of a few people. The price paid by the people was more than the benefits received. Therefore, river management at that time was only a matter for a few people, the interests of a few people. It could not show the great power of the people. Therefore, river management has not progressed for thousands of years, and science has not progressed in China for decades. It is only after liberation for two years that such great achievements can be made. The power to push the great wheel of historical progress has been launched! This ancient country, which has been stagnant in a dream for more than a thousand years, has therefore gained new life!
　　I would like to give another example to show this power. In the spring of 1948, the Jiaoji Railway had not yet been opened, and there was constant harassment on the Yellow River. The spring dike work in only ten counties (including two new counties) along the river below Jiyang County in Shandong Province exceeded several times the work done in the five years before the liberation of the entire Shandong Province. According to the report of the Shandong Provincial River Affairs Bureau: A total of 161 various earthworks were built, using approximately 2.6 million cubic meters of earth (the work in the five years from 1939 to 1941, and 1944 to 1945 only accounted for 12% of this); a total of 318 sections of various straw revetments were repaired, together with the preparation of flood prevention materials, totaling 44 million catties of straw, reeds, and willow branches (the work in the previous five years accounted for 40% of this); a total of 317 sections of brick and stone dams were repaired, together with the preparation of flood prevention materials, totaling 80,000 cubic meters of brick and stone (the work in the previous five years accounted for 78% of this); a total of 13.4 million man-days of civilian labor and 125,000 technical workers were used. A total of 46.5 million catties of grain were consumed (the consumption in the previous five years accounted for 63% of this). And the length of this section of the river is less than 200 kilometers, which is less than half of the previous 450 kilometers of the entire Shandong Province. Strictly speaking, the percentages in parentheses should be halved to be a correct comparison. According to the statistics of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, Shandong and Pingyuan provinces used approximately 30,000 cubic meters of earth, 550,000 cubic meters of brick and stone, and 200 million catties of straw and willow, which cannot be compared with the previous ones. But under such difficult conditions, where did these achievements come from? The Shandong River Affairs Bureau told us in its summary of the spring dike repair project in 1948: "...Even until early April this year, the cadres and the masses along the river were still very worried about whether we could cope with the urgent needs of the project before the big flood. The downstream, especially Putai, needed extremely large earthwork projects, but the manpower on the south bank of the Yellow River was not enough; the entire river needed a huge amount of brick and stone materials, but we had no brick and stone production sources except for a few small kilns; the downstream needed a large amount of food, but due to the disasters of Chiang Kai-shek and natural disasters, the downstream food had been exhausted, and work food must be transported from Yangzhong County upstream; and at this time, the Jiaoji Railway was entering a decisive stage, and enemy planes were constantly attacking our traffic on the Yellow River, and the western river was frequently under the threat of enemy attacks. These conditions gave the project almost insurmountable difficulties. However, when the district party committee and the administrative office understood the whole situation at the Yellow River Management Conference in April, and with the consent of the East China Bureau and the provincial government, made a firm decision, the strength of the entire district was quickly mobilized and organized, and the movement of brick and stone献砖献石, voluntary transportation, and the material raid was launched in the counties along the river; during the second phase of the project, under the slogan of "Farmers are one family天下农民是一家," the expeditionary force of Yellow River management from outside the area was organized to participate in the raid, and the Yellow River management project was completely changed in just two months under an unprecedented large-scale mass movement; under the call of the district party committee and the administrative office, the Jiyang County party and government led the masses to bravely attack and complete the 120,000 cubic meter earthwork project and deliver 6,000 cubic meters of stone materials under the fire of the enemy's碉堡 on the opposite bank, and solved all the project needs while enemy planes frequently attacked, and civilian laborers and large carts and livestock were killed and injured from time to time. ...Jianli, a small county with a population of 100,000, launched an unprecedented mass dike repair movement, making use of every production gap, and relying on its own efforts to complete more than 1.4 million cubic meters of earthwork. ...Hebei Wuqiao, Dongguang, Zhenhua, and Shandong Yangxin and Wudi counties organized a Yellow River management expeditionary force of more than 17,000 people..." There is no need to quote more of all this. See where this power comes from! There is no need to list examples from other sections.
　　Whether it is dike repair or flood prevention, it relies on the power of the people. To launch this great power, the basic thing is to mobilize the masses, organize the masses, and conduct extensive and in-depth political mobilization, so that the masses understand who they are working for, and connect river management with self-rescue, and voluntarily and consciously participate in the work. Only in this way can we maintain full enthusiasm. And we must solve the specific difficulties of the masses, make use of slack farming seasons, organize mutual assistance, take care of rural production and family life, and especially those with difficulties can be lent some grain first, so that the civilian laborers can work at ease on the dike construction. Production is the basic interest of the masses. We must resolve the contradiction between river management and production, and stipulate a reasonable wage system, paying by piece, rewarding more work with more pay, and stipulating a fair division of labor method, which should be discussed and brewed by the masses, and done quickly and finished quickly. Furthermore, we help to prepare the tools well, so that the manpower and tools can be properly matched. And with appropriate technical leadership, the masses educate the masses, and carry forward the creativity of the masses. In this way, tools and technology are combined with full enthusiasm, the work efficiency will be greatly improved, and the power of the masses can be reasonably brought into play.
　　River management is carried out through organizing the masses and educating the masses. It is an organized mass work. Take the flood prevention in Henan Province and Pingyuan Province in 1949 as an example. In addition to the various repair and defense offices and engineering teams under the Yellow River Conservancy Commission and the river affairs bureaus of the three provinces, each county along the river established a flood prevention headquarters specializing in handling flood prevention matters, with the county head as the commander, the repair and defense section chief as the deputy commander, and the county party committee secretary as the political commissar; if the section boundary spans two counties, the section chief and deputy section chiefs serve as the commanders of the two counties respectively; there are three sections for handling affairs. Flood prevention command posts are set up in each area along the river, in principle one every ten li, and a stronger cadre at the district level is assigned as the commander. For village-level flood prevention, a special person is designated by the village cadre to be responsible. Long-term flood prevention personnel are based on the temple or dike house as a unit, and according to the rise of the water flow, the number of people per temple can be increased from one to twelve. In times of crisis, a general mobilization is carried out to go to the dike for strict defense. Temporary flood prevention personnel are the militiamen in the flood prevention area, who usually produce at home and go to the dike temporarily when the water rises. This is a very strict and responsible organization. After the test of this year's major flood, this organization has indeed exerted great power.
　　The above is the general situation of civilian labor and flood prevention, which is very different from the past. Not to mention the difference in thinking, just in terms of methods, the conscription of labor in the past was forced by the rulers, and the food for the civilian laborers was first apportioned by the people. Several months after the completion of the project, the government would issue the funds. It was beautifully named payment according to work, but because the people had no organization and experience, five civilian laborers were not as good as one contractor. Even if money was paid according to work at the time of work, it was not enough to eat. Moreover, it was issued several months later, and the people had already dispersed. Where would they run dozens of miles to collect the money? Most of it was collected by the person in charge of the county government on behalf. It is difficult to speculate whether this money could reach the people or how much they could get. Therefore, the impression of the general residents along the river is that they have never received money for going out to repair the dikes. When conscription comes, it is a errand, forced and passive, and the work has nothing to do with oneself. In addition, the rulers at that time were perfunctory, cutting corners, corrupt, and abusing and scolding the salt workers system, how can we talk about work enthusiasm and efficiency?
　　Talking about cadres being responsible to the people is also worthy of praise. Work study and review have become the biggest weapons for river management. River management is originally a technical work, which cannot be done by novices, but due to study, many talents have been cultivated in recent years, and due to review, work efficiency has been greatly improved. There are the most experiences and insights of this kind in the documents, which are most worthy of learning. I admire that kind of careful and patient research spirit, meticulous analysis, to find the center of the problem and actively solve it. This is different from the past when bureaucrats managed the river and avoided difficulties. These problems are all details, which seem trivial to talk about. Let me give a couple of examples from the 1938 summary of the Shandong River Affairs Bureau. The summary of experience is divided into two parts: "Earthwork" and "Revetment." There are four items on earthwork. The first item is "How to arrange the project." The first item is divided into three sections, and the first section is "How to mobilize and prepare locally." This section is further divided into three items. The first item is "How to solve the contradiction between Yellow River management and production?" Here, eight typical mobilization methods are listed, all of which are explained and criticized. Here, only a summary explanation of this item is given to show the whole picture.
　　The first method is the full labor method of Kenli County: they unified and concentrated their strength, engaged in production during busy farming seasons, and put all their efforts into Yellow River management during slack farming seasons. They completed the assigned work in stages. The second method is the group labor method of Wuqiao, Zhenhua and other counties: each village is divided into groups, and those who go to work guarantee to complete the task and return home, and those who stay at home guarantee to help with production. The third method is the "seven-man, three-land" burden method of Gaoyuan and Qingcheng: hire workers to replace the people who go out to work for production, and the expenses are borne by the whole village according to the "seven-man, three-land" ratio. The fourth method is to carry out education and mobilization in advance, and sign up voluntarily. The fifth method is to take turns to work in the civil labor unit. The sixth method is to seize the method. The seventh method is to raise money to hire workers. The eighth method is the whole village takes turns to change workers: some are changed every three days. The review conclusion is: The first and second methods can indeed solve the production problem. The first method is more suitable for counties with large industrial works along the river. The second method is suitable for counties far from the river. The third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh methods have failed to solve the contradiction between Yellow River management and production more clearly. The eighth is the worst method, which is detrimental to both the public and private. Its shortcomings are: 1. It is difficult to grasp the thinking, so the quality of the work is difficult to guarantee. 2. With the thought of "doing or not doing, four and a half catties, wait three days, and go home," the work efficiency is low. 3. It takes time to travel back and forth, wasting a lot of manpower. How deep and meticulous is this kind of research by dividing the items and solving the specific problems for the people!
　　Let me give another example. This is the third item of earthwork, "How to implement the wage policy," and the third section, "How to break through the ideological obstacles between cadres and the masses during the implementation of the wage policy." Among them, the first item is "How to break through the thinking of cadres." It is recognized that there are four kinds of obstacles in the thinking of cadres: 1. Cadres listen to reflections and do not understand the real demands of the masses. For example, after putting forward the slogan of "more work, more pay," the slippery people destroyed it by saying: "We are one family, don't count this account. It doesn't matter who does more or less, everyone is family." Cadres often think it is the opinion of the masses. 2. Cadres are paralyzed and complacent in their thinking. For example, when they see that there are active people who carry more soil, they think it is a general situation. 3. One-sided mass concept, thinking that the masses are already very hard, can you still kill people? 4. Afraid of trouble, unwilling to calculate accounts every day. Therefore, in response to these obstacles, methods for breaking through were proposed. The second item is "How to break through the thinking of the masses." There are mainly three situations in the thinking of the masses: 1. They are worried that the wages are not enough to eat. 2. They think that Yellow River management is a task of support and do not want to get food. 3. The honest people bury their heads in hard work and feel depressed, feeling that some people are lazy and can't go home early. In response to the above thinking, the method of accounting is used, paying according to work, and promoting the meritorious movement. After the ideological obstacles were broken through, everyone supported the wage policy very much, saying: "Implementing this method will allow us to go home three days earlier."
　　There is no need to cite other examples. Cadres are so earnestly solving problems for the people, which is completely different from the opposition between the ruling class and the people in the past.
　　I would like to give another example on the overall aspect of the review. In addition to reviewing various tasks, the summary of Henan and Pingyuan provinces in 1948 also had an overall estimate. After saying the achievements and advantages, it put forward the errors and shortcomings. Under each item of errors and shortcomings, instances and figures are given. Now only the conclusion is recorded below: 1. In terms of work style, we have serious problems, that is, when deciding or making work plans, we do not investigate or study, and we are often subjective and blind, and put forward requirements and decided on plans. 2. In our organizations at all levels, there is a widespread phenomenon of anarchy, indiscipline, laxity, and waste. The root cause is the lack of overall concept and organizational concept, starting from the individual, starting from our own position and localism, treating the place we manage as an independent country, without asking for instructions beforehand and not reporting afterwards. 3. The leadership at all levels is very negligent in the political education and study of all Yellow River employees. 4. The understanding of the characteristics of the Yellow River's tendency to breach is still very vague. We do not understand that the Yellow River is an untamed monster for thousands of years, and we often have paralysis and illusions in our thinking. As for some of the facts summarized, they are not listed now. The last few words say: "Our revolutionary soldiers, under the leadership of the Communist Party, never conceal our shortcomings and mistakes, but dare to expose them ruthlessly, and gradually drive out wrong ideas from our thoughts and actions, so that we can move towards a brighter road."
　　This kind of ruthless exposure and courageous admission of mistakes is what the ruling class did not dare to do. Everything about them is false and deceptive, and they are completely selfish individualists. They cannot combine with the masses, so there will be no progress, and this does not doom everything about them? Now those who lead the masses are a member of the masses, coming from the masses and going to the masses, serving the masses wholeheartedly. And the masses recognize their own position, turn themselves over, become the masters, and feel that everything is closely related to them, sharing weal and woe. Their collective life and collective work, with unity from top to bottom, are showing an invincible great power everywhere. This is a clear contrast between the people's river management and the "River Governor's" river management.
　　(The River Governor is the official name for river management in the Ming and Qing dynasties, and is the abbreviation of the Governor-General of River Courses. Here it is taken to represent the ruling class of river management.)

　　人民治河与“河督”治河
    张含英
    我在六月下旬到开封的时候，适当黄河水利委员会召集的防汛会议将要结束，听说今年的防汛任务是“保证陕县的黄河水流涨到一万六千秒公方时，下游大堤不使决口。”这使我十分惊奇、怀疑，同时也透露着一些希望。陕县设站观测黄河水流，已经三十年了，它涨落的变化和数量都有纪录。一万六千秒公方的水流，差不多可以排在第四个高位。根据过去的决口统计，陕县涨到一万秒公方，下游大堤决口的可能性是百分之七十五。一万六千比一万高出了很多，怎敢有这样大胆的保证呢？对人民不负责吗？况且黄河回归故道以后，才经过两个大汛，多年于塞的河道，残破的堤防，又适在支援前线，解放战争正在积极进行的时候，会有这样大的人力物力，来治理修整吗？我很替这个诺言担心！
    我逐渐的翻阅黄河的工作计划、报告和总结一类的文件，从这里我发现了许多新的事物，内容和精神，与旧的比起来，显得鲜明、活跃、有生气。所以对治河也逐渐透露些希望。对于这些文件不只在翻阅，而是开始在学习了。可是从文字上的认识，究竟难以切实深刻，仅仅得到些慨念而已。不久大汛到来，又经历了实际的情形，对于目前治河的情势，还有了更进一步的认识。
    七月上旬第一次涨水，陕县流量到七千秒公方，这时下游堤防仅有少数工程发生塌陷的现象。到了下旬，遇到第二次涨水，陕县流量到了一万五千四百秒公方，我认为考验的时候到了。自然各处段亦都提高警觉，昼夜加工，可是又平平安安的过了。看到这样不惊慌不忙乱，而沉着应付的行动，大有游刃有余的气概，真的出乎意外。在以前象这大水，一定闹的天翻地覆，开封的人民亦不会安枕的。经过这次涨水，使我对于黄河的看法不能不改变，不能不重新估计它的力量。
    这时候我们正在草拟明年的工作计划。山东省提出来明年防汛以泺口水流一万三千秒公方为目标，这是泺口在一九三七年的最大纪录。也是自有观测以来的最大纪录。平原省认为明年防汛应该提高一步，要以水流一万八千秒公方为目标，这是陕县最高纪录的第三位。我很兴奋，这种积极负责的作风，给我很大的希望和鼓励。自从黄河有修防以来，虽然在理论上计划过，但总没有敢于提出这样坚决、进取的保证。这实在是黄河史上的新纪元，这是人民几千年的愿望；由于过去统治阶级的压迫、剥削、奴役，和一次又一次的灾难，他们不敢起这个念头，只希望能减少些剥削和压迫，就满足了。稍微给一些剩余的，或要买人心的好处，人民就感到“皇恩浩荡”，“太平盛世”，那敢还存着奢望？现在人民翻了身，他们可以表达出他们的愿望，也真的就能自由的，勇敢的，努力去实现这个愿望。不信么？即刻又有了进一步的证明！
    从八月下旬就阴天，虽然雨不急，可是下了二十几天，黄河的水逐渐的高涨起来。这次陕县的最大水，虽然还没有上次大，可是持续的时间很久，河南省的河槽很宽，可是到了平原省和山东省，堤距逐渐的缩了。这是黄河上崎形的堤防设施。若是陕县的水流倏涨倏落，那么有些水停积在河南段的槽内，便减轻了下游的威胁。设若水流持续不降，这种作用减轻，平原和山东就要危急了。这一次陕县水流持续在一万秒公方以上的有一百小时，超出所有的纪录，可以说是最持久的洪水。在五千秒公方流量以上的洪水总数为三十五亿公方，较之纪录上最大的洪水总量之一九三三年的还高。所以说这次的洪水虽不算最高，而洪水总量是有纪录以来最大的。泺口流量也因之追上了一九三七的纪录。这一次考验是伟大的。仅只寿张一带就出了三十几个漏洞，堤顶出水仅半公尺。于是单只平原省便有十二万群众，五千干部上堤。在风里雨里，不分昼夜的和黄河作了无情的斗争。虽然在寿张北岸的民埝，和南岸梁山的民埝，有两处决口，终于获得了大堤防卫的胜利，保全了数百万人民的生命财产。这在过去是不可能的！即是有这样多群众上堤，也不可能有这些干部，也只是乌合之众，各人有各人的一条心。在压迫强制和自私自利的个人本位之下，不可能有这样成就。现在人民觉悟了，大家抱在一块了，象救自己家的火一样的心情，千百万人一齐干，那有不能克服的事情？俗话说：“二人同心、其力断金。”况且现在的千百万人么？说他们有力量实现他们的愿望，还能不信么？反过来说，从前的决口多半是由于人为的，能算是过分么？
    人民治河与统治阶级治河是不同的。以前统治阶级治河，根本对人民不负责任，除借治河来达到升官发财满足个人的欲望外，真正为国家人民的太少了，所谓一种最好的也不过是抱着一种慈善心肠，或者要买人心，来巩固自己的地位吧了。偶尔因为在这方向努力的结果，有些许成绩，造成“盛世”，成了“能臣”，人民也觉得与自己无关，只不过巩固了少数人的地位，和满足了少数人的欲望。人民所出的代价，比惠益还多。所以那时的治河只是少数人的事，少数人的利益。是不能现出人民伟大的力量的。所以治河几千年没进步，科学到中国几十年也没进步，解放才二年就能有这样大的成就，这一个推转历史进步的巨轮的力量发动了！停滞在睡梦中千余年的古国因此有了新生！
    我愿再举一个实例，表示这个力量。一九四八年的春天，胶济路还没打通，黄河上也不断有搔扰。仅山东省济阳县以下的沿河十县（内有新县二）春厢工作，就超出了山东全境解放前五年工作的几倍。据山东省河务局的报告：总计修筑各种土工一百六十一处，用土约二百六十万方（一九三九——一九四一，及一九四四——一九四五等五年的工作，仅当此百分之十二）；共修各种秸埽三百一十八段，连同备防料物，共计秸苇柳枝四千四百万斤（前五年的工作当此百分之四十）；共修砖石坝三百一十七段，连同备防料物，共计砖石八万方（前五年的工作当此百分之七十八）；用民工一千三百四十万个，技术工十二万五千个。共计化费用粮四千六百五十万斤（前五年的化用当此百分之六十三）。而这一段的河长不及二百公里，还不到以前山东全境河道长四百五十公里长的一半。严格说来，括弧内的百分数都应该减半，才是正确的比较。又据黄委会的统计，山东平原两省共用土约三万公方，砖石约五十五万公方，秸柳约两万万市斤，和以前的就更不能开比例了。可是在这样的艰苦情况下，这些成就从那里来的？山东河务局在一九四八年春修堤工程总结里告诉我们：“……甚至直到今年四月初，沿河干部和群众，对于我们究竟在大汛前能否应付工程的紧急需要，还是抱着很大忧虑。下游特别是蒲台，需要极大的土方工程，但黄河南岸的人力不敷分配；全河需要巨大数量的砖石料，但我们除了几座小窑外，没有任何砖石产源；下游需要大批粮食，但因蒋灾和天灾，下游粮食已告枯竭，必须由上游杨忠县运送工粮；而这时还正当胶济线进入决议，敌机不断袭扰我黄河上的交通，西部沿河更经常在敌人攻击的威胁下。这些条件给予工程以几乎不可克服的困难。但当四月治黄会议上，区党委、行署了解全部情况，并在华东局、省府同意下，做出坚决的决定后，全区的力量，便迅速动员组织起来，沿河各县的献砖献石，义务运输，突击材料运动展开了；二期工程在“天下农民是一家”的口号下，外区治黄的远征军组织起来参加突击，治黄工程在空前规模的群众性的运动下，仅在短短两月间，便全部改观；在区党委、行署的号召之下，济阳县党政领导着群众在对岸敌人碉堡的火力下，在敌机经常袭扰，民工及大车牲口时有死伤下，英勇的突击完成十二万公方土的工程，献运六千公方石料，解决了全部工程需要。……坚利以下十万人口的小县发动了空前规模的，利用每个生产空隙的群众性的修堤运动，自力更生完成土工一百四十余万公方。……河北吴桥、东光、振华及山东阳信、无棣等五县组织了数达一万七千余人的治黄远征军，……”这一切不必再多引了。看出来这力量是从那里来的吧！其他各段的例子，也不必再列举了。
    无论是修堤或防汛，都是依靠人民的力量，要想发动这一伟大的力量，基本上在于发动群众，组织群众，广泛深入的政治动员，使群众明白了为谁工作，将治河和自救连在一起，自愿自觉的参加工作，只有这样才能保持着饱满情绪。并且必须给群众解决具体的困难，利用农暇，组织互助，照顾到农村生产和家庭生活，特别困难的可以先借给一些粮食，使民工能安心的在堤工上工作。生产是群众基本利益，必须解除治河与生产的矛盾，并规定合理的工资制度，按件给资，多做多得，规定公平的分工办法，由群众酝酿讨论，快做快完。再则对于工具帮助着准备好，使人力和工具得到适当的配合。并以技术上适当的领导，以群众教育群众，发扬群众的创造性。这样，工具、技术结合着饱满的情绪，工作效率就要大大提高，群众的力量才能合理的发挥出来。
    治河工作是通过组织群众、教育群众来进行的。是一个有组织的群众性的工作。拿河南省和平原省的一九四九年的防汛来说明。除了黄委会和三省河务局以下的各修防处和工程队外，沿河各县，皆设立防汛指挥部，专事处理防汛事宜，由县长任指挥长，修防段长任副指挥长，县委书记任政委；段界跨两县者，正副段长分任两县指挥长；下设三股办事。沿河各区设立防汛指挥点，原则上以十华里设一个，由区级派一较强的干部任指挥长。村级防汛，由村干指定专人负责。长期防汛员以庵或堤屋为单位，按水流上涨的情形，每庵由一人可增至十二人。危急时总动员上堤严防。临时防汛员，就是防汛区的自卫队员，平时在家生产，遇水涨临时上堤。这是一个非常严密而负责的组织，经过今年大汛的考验，这个组织确是发挥了极大的力量。
    以上是民工和防汛的概况，和以往对照是大不相同的。姑且不说思想上的差别，单就办法来讲，从前征工是由统治者强迫的，民工的吃食是先由人民分摊的。到了完工几个月后，政府才将经费发下来。美其名曰按工给值，但是因为人民没有组织和经验，五个民工不当一个包工。就是作工时按工发钱，也是不够吃的。况且又在几个月以后发放，人民早散了，那里会跑几十里路再来取款？多半是由县政府的负责人代领。这些钱究能不能到人民身上，或能得到多少，是难以揣测的。所以一般沿河居民的印象是向来出夫修堤没拿过钱的。征调来了，就是应差，强迫的，被动的，工作和自己不发生关系。再加以那时统治者敷衍塞责，偷工减料，贪污腐化，和打骂的盐工制度，还能谈得上工作情绪和效率吗？
    谈到干部对人民负责，这也是值得赞扬的，工作的学习和检讨，变成了治河最大的武器。治河本来是有技术性的工作，不是生手能干的，但是由于学习，几年里造就了许多人才，由于检讨，工作效率大见提高，文件中对于这一类的经验和心得最多，最值得学习。我佩服那种细心，有耐性的钻研精神，一丝不苟的分析，求得问题的中心主动的去解决。这和从前官僚治河逃避困难是不同的，这些问题都是细目，说来琐碎。还是举山东河务局一九三八年总结的一二例吧。关于经验的总结分“土工　”与“埽埧”两部。关于土工的有四项，第一项是“怎样布置工程”。第一项里又分三节，第一节是“地方上如何动员准备”。在这一节下又分了三目，第一目是“怎样解决治黄与生产的矛盾？”在这里列举了八种典型的动员方法，都加以说明和批评。这里仅单就这一目摘要说明，以示全豹。
    第一种是垦利县的全民出夫办法：他们统一集中力量，农忙时搞生产，农隙时全部投入治黄。把分配的工作，分期办完。第二种是吴桥、振华等县的分组出工的办法：各庄分为小组，出工的保证完成任务回家，在家的保证帮助生产。第三种是高苑、青城的人七地三的负担办法：雇工代出工的人作生产，开支由全村按人七地三负担。第四种是预先教育动员，自愿报名的办法。第五种是照民工单轮流出夫。第六种是抓办法。第七种是凑钱雇工。第八种是全村轮流换夫办法：有的是三天一换。检讨结论是：第一、二两种办法确能解决生产问题。第一种办法更适于沿河工大的县份。第二种办法适合于距河较远的县份。第三、四、五、六、七等办法，都未能将治黄与生产的矛盾更明确的解决。第八种是最不好的办法，公私两不利，它的缺点是：一、思想难掌握，因此工作的质量难保证。二、抱着“干不干，四斤半，等三天，回家转”的思想，工作效率低。三、来往费时，浪费人力极大。这样分条别目的研讨，替人民解决具体问题，是何等深入、精细！
    让我再举一个例子。这是土工第三项的“怎样贯彻工资政策”，第三节“贯彻工资政策中间，如何打通干部及群众间思想障碍”。其中第一目是“如何打通干部的思想”，认篇干部的思想有四种障碍：一、干部听取反映，不了解真正群众要求。例如提出“多做多得”的口号后，滑头破坏说：“咱是一家人，不算这个帐，谁多谁少，大家老少爷们，不在乎。”干部常认为是群众意见。二、干部思想麻痹自满，例如看到有积极的，抬土多的，认为是一般情况。三、片面群众观念，认为群众已经很辛苦，还能把人家累死吗？四、怕麻烦，不愿天天算帐。于是便针对这些障碍，提出了打通的办法。又第二目是“如何打通群众思想”，群众的思想主要的有三种情况：一、对于工资是不够吃，有顾虑。二、认为治黄是支差任务，不想得粮。三，老实人埋头苦干的苦闷，觉得有些人偷懒，不得早回家。针对以上思想，利用算帐办法，按工给值，并推行立功运动。思想打通后，对于工资政策，大家十分拥护，说：“实行这个办法，能早回家三天”。
    其他的例子不必再引了，干部这样认真的为人民解决问题，这和从前统治阶级与人民对立，是绝然不同的。
    我愿再就整体方面的检讨举个例子。一九四八年河南平原两省的总结，除了对于各种工作加以检讨外，又有总的估计，于说出了成绩和优点以后，就提出错误与缺点。在错误与缺点的每一项下，更举出实例和数字。现在只就结语记在下边：一、在作风方面我们存在着严重的毛病，就是决定或制出工作计划时，不调查，不研究，常常是主观的盲目的，提出了要求，决定了计划。二、在我们各级组织中，普遍的存在着无政府无纪律松懈废弛的现象。其根源是缺乏整体观念，组织观念，从个人出发，从本位和地方主义出发，把自己管理的地方，当做一个独立国，事前不请示，事后不报告。三、对全河员工政治教育与学习，各级领导上十分疏忽。四、对黄河善决的特性认识上还是很模糊的，不了解黄河是一个几千年不驯服的怪物，在思想上常常的产生麻痹与幻想。至于总结的一些事实，现右都不去例举了。最后几句话说：“我们革命的战士，在共产党领导下面，从来是不隐蔽我们的缺点和错误，而且敢于无情的揭发，逐渐从我们思想上、行动上驱逐错误的思想，使我们走向更光明的道路。”
    这种无情的揭发，和勇敢的认错，这是统治阶级所不敢为的。他们一切是虚伪的、欺骗的，他们完全是自私自利的个人主义。就不能结合群众，就不会有进步，这不就注定了他们的一切了么？现在领导群众的，是群众的一分子，从群众中来，到群众中去，全心全意为群众服务。而群众认为了自己的地位，翻身了，变成主人，便觉一切都与他们是休戚相关、苦乐与共的。他们集体的生活、集体的工作，上下团结一致，处处都在表现着一种不可战胜的伟大力量。这便是人民治河与“河督”治河的一个明显的对比。
    （河督是明朝和清朝治河的官名，是河道总督的简称。这里取作代表治河的统治阶级。）
