Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 10th. The Shandong Provincial Yellow River Affairs Bureau, in order to prevent floods next year, has instructed fifteen counties along the Yellow River in Shandong Province, including Gaoqing and Kenli, as well as Jinan City, to seize the time before the harsh winter arrives and quickly carry out winter repairs and strengthen river embankments. It is estimated that the entire project will require more than 2.8 million cubic meters of earthwork, requiring more than 2.6 million workdays. Among them, the paving work on the Jinan City section of the embankment will be raised by 1.9 meters based on this year's highest flood level of 32.33 meters; the flat sections will be widened to 7 meters at the top of the embankment, and the dangerous sections will be widened to 7 to 12 meters at the top of the embankment. Currently, with the exception of Jinan, which has already started construction, all sections will begin construction in mid-November and are expected to be completed within 20 days.
