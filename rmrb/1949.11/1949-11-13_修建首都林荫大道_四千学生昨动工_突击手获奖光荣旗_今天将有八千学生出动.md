    Building the Capital Boulevard
    Four Thousand Students Began Work Yesterday
    Shock Brigade Awarded Banners of Glory
    Eight Thousand Students to Turn Out Today
    [Beijing News] More than four thousand young students in the capital celebrated "World Youth Day" and "International Students' Week" yesterday (the 12th) by participating in half a day of voluntary labor on the construction of the capital's first boulevard. Participants included twenty units from schools such as Huiwen, Muzhen, Datong, Girls' No. 4 Middle School, and Advanced Business School. Their task is to first level the roadbed from Dongdan to Wangfujing, a project requiring the excavation of eight thousand cubic meters of earth. The young people demonstrated their working enthusiasm and high level of organization during the three hours of labor yesterday. At 2:00 PM, each unit arrived on time, and with the sound of firecrackers, more than four thousand people began work simultaneously. The work area was divided into a shock zone and a competition zone. Each school unit was organized into squads and platoons, with "instructors," "logistics," "liaison," and "scouts" coordinating the work of the labor brigade. Most groups exceeded their original targets. The terrain in the "shock zone" was uneven, and the project was more difficult. Units working in this zone, such as Yuying and Huiwen schools, were awarded "Glorious Shock Brigade" banners by the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League and the Municipal Construction Bureau, respectively. Units participating in the competition zone, such as Datong, Yanji, and Girls' No. 4 Middle School, achieved outstanding results and won "Labor Red Banners." Each participating unit also received several copies of the "Voluntary Labor Commemorative Booklet" to be distributed to the "Young Labor Heroes" who emerged during the half-day of voluntary labor in each school.
    Furthermore: It has been decided that more than eight thousand young students from various middle schools will continue to participate in the construction of the boulevard today.

    修建首都林荫大道
    四千学生昨动工
    突击手获奖光荣旗
    今天将有八千学生出动
    【北京讯】首都的青年学生四千余人，昨（十二）日以参加修筑首都第一条林荫大道工程的半日义务劳动，来庆祝“世界青年日”和“国际学生周”。参加的有汇文、慕贞、大同、女四中、高商等二十单位。他们的任务，首先是铺平东单至王府井的路基，此项工程必须动土八千立方公尺。在昨日三小时的劳动中，充分的表现了青年们的工作热忱和高度的组织性，下午二时，各单位都准时到场，爆竹一响，四千多人同时动工。工作区域分突击区和竞赛区两处，各校单位编成小队和中队，有“指导员”、“后勤”、“联络”“斥堠”分别配合劳动大队工作。各组工作大都超过了原定的任务。“突击区”的地皮是凹凸不平，工程比较艰巨，参加该区工作的单位如育英、汇文等校都分别得到了青年团北京市工委和市建设局所奖给的“光荣突击手”旗帜。参加竞赛区的单位，有大同、燕冀和女四中等，都以突出的成绩，获得“劳动红旗”。其他每个参加单位都领到了“义务劳动纪念册”数本，分赠各校半日义务劳动中涌现出来的“青年劳动英雄”们。
    又：今日各中学校青年学生八千余名，已决定继续参加修筑林荫大道工程。
