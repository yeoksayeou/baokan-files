The German Provisional People's Chamber Passes Resolution to Establish Supreme Court and Procuratorate
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 12th. TASS Berlin dispatch: The Provisional People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic held its fifth plenary session in Berlin on the 9th. Foreign Minister Dodinger announced to the parliament that the German Democratic Republic had established diplomatic relations with other countries. He said: The foreign policy of the German Democratic Republic aims to achieve international recognition and the national self-determination of the German people. In this regard, it has received the strong support of the peace camp headed by the Soviet Union. The German democratic forces were particularly inspired when they heard Malenkov's remarks on the German issue in the report on the thirty-second anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution. As a person responsible for the new German foreign policy, I believe that today we must express our gratitude to the Soviet Union for its effective assistance and consistent support in the struggle of the National Front of Democratic Germany for unity, peace, and democracy. This support given to us by the Soviet Union, the People's Democracies, and the entire peace camp has given us the strength and confidence to successfully realize our just cause.

The Provisional People's Chamber then, according to the proposals of various parties, passed a resolution on the commemoration of the thirty-second anniversary of the Great October Revolution, which emphasized that the solid friendship between the Soviet and German people is a strong bulwark of world peace. The Provisional People's Chamber also unanimously adopted the laws on the establishment of the Supreme Court and the Supreme Procuratorate of the German Democratic Republic, and other laws, based on the government's proposal. The Provisional People's Chamber approved the trade agreement recently concluded between the German Democratic Republic and the Hungarian People's Republic.
