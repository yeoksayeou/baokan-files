People's Song and Dance, Long Live!
　　A Review of the Grand Song and Dance "Long Live the People's Victory"
    Tian Han

    After performing the grand song and dance "Long Live the People's Victory," the students of North China University are humbly and sincerely seeking feedback and opinions from all sides. This is a very good creative attitude. Why do I say creative attitude? Because a work is not truly completed after its first appearance. It must carefully listen to the opinions of the audience, revise it again and again, polish it again and again, and only then can it become a radiant work of art. A tailor takes measurements and rushes to make clothes, but is too lazy to ask the client to try them on repeatedly; it will never be satisfactory. Is that clear?

    I only saw this grand song and dance once, at the CPPCC evening party. Actually, I can't have any complete opinions, but I have an obligation to convey a little, which is that the audience that night, from young people to old soldiers with silver hair, were all very moved by this song and dance. Especially the representatives from the newly liberated areas, who suddenly came into contact with such a scene, were so excited that they almost shed tears. After watching it, many people praised it to the skies.

    This song and dance drama, later performed at the Liberation Theater, also had a very good effect. This proves that the citizens of Beijing are not unable to accept new art or be infected by new emotions. The problem always lies in whether what we give them is truly new and whether you can convey it more artistically.

    I say truly new things have two meanings. One is that the ideological content truly represents the demands of the broad masses of the people, and can also be understood and loved by them, not something that is ambiguous or new in a strange way. The second refers to digging deeper. After the initial excitement of the revolution has passed, when the people enter the difficult stage of national construction, they will not be too welcome those general, superficial excitements, but demand to delve into the revolutionary reality and truly achieve "reason and emotion." Song and dance dramas are no exception. Of course, this also increases the burden on our song and dance drama creators. "Long Live the People's Victory" has played a certain role in praising the people's victory and arousing everyone's love for the new country and the new regime. We have not gone the wrong way, but we must continue to go deeper. Otherwise, this excitement cannot last too long.

    Comrade Hu Sha reported on the creative process, saying: This time, the Taiwan and Tibet dances, due to the strong combativeness of the lyrics and the well-organized strength of the scenes, achieved great political effect and showed touching power. This is good, but we must not be complacent, because in terms of artistic forms such as costumes and dance, it is clear that they cannot yet match the ideological content. I dare not say about Tibet. I have been in contact with seven highland tribes in Taiwan except for the Yami tribe on Red Head Island. I have also seen the dances of the Atayal, Amis, and Paiwan tribes, but the Taiwan dance in this grand song and dance drama cannot evoke any real feeling. (The film "Hualien Port" in Shanghai has highland dances. That is the Atayal tribe in Wushe twisting, which is different from the Amis dance in "Hualien Port.")

    The art of the founding stage wins with spirit and ideological content. This is inevitable, and even our Soviet friends have the same feeling. Regardless of the duet dance of the Dukinskaya's and the Red Army dance of the Red Army Song and Dance Ensemble, in terms of dance skills, we are not yet able to learn from them. But our kind of fiery political enthusiasm and the joy of the founding victory make our Soviet friends can't help but admire and be moved.

    "After watching your dance drama, it reminds us of the early days of our revolution."

    Yes, I have not forgotten the profound impression that the Duncan Dance Troupe gave us at the Odeon Theater in Shanghai in 1928. That was combat! That was a roar!

    Last time I visited the dance school attached to the Bolshoi Theater in Moscow, I asked about Ms. Duncan. She died many years ago. Her dance troupe no longer exists. But the influence of her spirit still exists in today's dance dramas.

    In order to guarantee the greater development and more brilliant future of our national song and dance drama, in addition to asking everyone to pay attention to technology and strive for technology, I also ask comrades to always maintain the high political enthusiasm, hatred and struggle against darkness and evil, and the spirit of love and praise for light and freedom, which has become the characteristic of our today.

### 人民歌舞万岁！　评“人民胜利万岁”大歌舞

　　人民歌舞万岁！
  　评“人民胜利万岁”大歌舞
    田汉
    华大同学们在演出“人民胜利万岁”大歌舞后，虚心地、诚恳地征求各方面的反应和意见，这是很好的创作态度。为什么说是创作态度？因为一个作品在第一次问世后还不算是真正完成了。必须仔细听取观赏者的意见，改了又改，磨了又磨，这才能是成为光芒万丈的艺术品。裁缝量好尺寸，把衣服赶成，而懒得叫定做者一再试穿，决不会让人满意的，这─明白吗？
    这一大歌舞我只在政协晚会上看过一次。其实是不能有什么完整的意见的，但我有义务传达一点，便是当晚的观众，从年青人到白发如银的老战士，都很受这歌舞的感动。特别是从新解放区来的代表们，骤然接触这样的场面，简直兴奋得要流眼泪。看完出门，许多人赞不绝口。
    这歌舞剧，后来在解放剧场演出，效果也是很好的。这证明北京市民观众并非不能接受新的艺术，或不能感染新的情绪。问题始终在于我们给他们的是不是真正新的东西，和你是不是能更艺术地传达它。
    我说真正新的东西有两个意思。一是思想内容真正代表了广大人民的要求，也为他们所能理解、爱好，不是那种似是而非，或新的有些古怪的东西。二是指掘得更深的东西，革命的初期兴奋过去之后，人民进入艰难建国的阶段，便不会太欢迎那些近于一般的门面的刺戟，而要求深入革命现实，真做到“入情入理”。歌舞剧也不能例外。当然也增加了我们歌舞剧创作者的负担。“人民胜利万岁”在歌颂人民胜利，鼓起大家对新国家新政权的热爱是起了一定作用的。我们的路没有走错，但要继续走下去，要走得更深。要不然这兴奋不能太持久。
    胡沙同志报告创作经过说：这次台湾、西藏舞由于歌词内容的斗争性很强，场面的力量组织很好，获得了很大的政治效果，表现出感人的力量。这是不错的，但我们也不可自足，因为就服装、舞蹈等艺术形式说，显然还不能与思想内容相配合。西藏方面我不敢说。台湾七种高山族除了红头屿的雅米族外，其他六族我都有过接触。也看过太雅尔族、阿米族、排万族等的跳舞，却不能由这个大歌舞剧中的台湾舞引起任何实感。（上海“花莲港”影片中有高山族舞，那是雾社的太雅尔族扭的与“花莲港”的阿米族舞蹈又不一样。）
    开国阶段的艺术是以气胜，以思想内容胜。这是必然的，就连苏联朋友们也有同样感想。不论杜金斯卡娅们的双人舞和红军歌舞团的红军舞，就舞艺说还不是我们所能学步的。但我们一种火炽的政治热情和开国的胜利的欢喜，使我们苏联朋友们也不能不欣羡，不能不感动。
    “看了你们的舞剧，使我们想起我们革命的初期”。
    是的，我还没有忘记一九二八年邓肯跳舞团在上海奥地安戏院给我们的深刻印象。那是战斗！那是吼叫！
    上次在莫斯科参观大戏院附属舞校时，我曾问起邓肯女士。她死了多年了。她的跳舞团也不存在了。但她的精神影响却还存在今天的舞剧中。
    为着保证我们的民族歌舞剧更大的发展更辉煌的前途，我除了要求大家注意技术争取技术外，更要求同志们把成为我们今天的特色的高度政治热情，对黑暗罪恶的憎恨与斗争，对光明自由的热爱与歌颂精神始终保持下去。
