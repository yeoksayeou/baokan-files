Before the Movement Began

Production Could Not Complete Planned Products, Material Waste Was Huge

In order to change this situation, the Machinery Bureau, in cooperation with the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions and the worker-student internship group, went to the factories in July to help with the work. After in-depth investigation and research, they first corrected the leadership's erroneous view that "production is active, but ideology is backward." At the same time, they mobilized workers to carry out time standardization and create a record of shortening working hours, which opened the door to the movement, planning to initially solve the three problems of worker movement, wage system, and factory management through this approach.

Workers Automatically Shorten Working Hours to Open the Situation

The movement began with relatively in-depth ideological education. Through repeated visits, lectures, and discussions, the various concerns that generally existed among the workers about not wanting to show all their skills were dispelled, especially after sincere conversations and mobilization of the old skilled workers in the factory who were burdened with the "politically backward" label. The workers' thinking matured, and the trade union called on the workers to report the shortening of working hours themselves, with 155 people signing up on the spot. Then, the labor time measurement was carried out with the First Work Department as the focus. The first experiments were carried out on the marking group of Party member Zhang Shangju and the turret lathe of Youth League member Zhao Guoyou, and initial results were achieved. Their records were spread throughout the factory through blackboards, news reports, and standardization red flags. As a result, the movement to create records expanded from one workshop to various workshops, from one or two advanced individuals to more than 130 people, forming a heat wave from point to point. It developed from increasing labor intensity to create new records, and then combined with rationalization proposals to improve tools and operating techniques. Zhao Guoyou improved the turret lathe tools three times, and created the operating method of combining turning and milling. Zhang Shangju's marking group changed the lathe to a horizontal lathe, and eighteen rationalization proposals were adopted and widely disseminated within a month.

New records are constantly emerging, and labor productivity is increasing several times over. The September production plan was to manufacture 30 six-foot lathes, but the result was 45 lathes were completed. The working hours for making one lathe were reduced from 231.2 to 153. In the production process, the trade union organized workers to formulate detailed production plans for individuals and workshops, and at the same time, represented the workers in signing collective contracts with the administration, and formulated collective over-quota reward measures in the contract. At the same time, in order to ensure the connection of the production sequence of each workshop, a connection contract between workshops was formulated. The collective contract led the innovation record movement to an organized battle to complete a plan, which played an organizational, promoting, and supervisory role in the new record movement, and the collective over-quota reward gave the workers' labor enthusiasm a material guarantee. This made the tense production battle a complete victory.

From this relatively precisely planned production process, it is possible to find a work-hour quota for manufacturing a lathe that is close to actual time. In each workshop, the work-hour standardization is repeated several times for each part processing process to obtain the average time. After discussing it with the workers and obtaining their consent, the administration determined the product quantity and work-hour quota. At this point, the record-breaking movement was led to quota management. On this basis, the study and implementation of the individual over-quota reward wage system replaced the previous collective over-quota reward method. Due to the implementation of the individual over-quota reward system, at the beginning of October, the record-breaking movement developed to a higher stage - new records of watching the number of lathes successively appeared. For example, Yan Yingchen, Zhang Rumahu, and Lin Zhenhua each led an apprentice to watch three milling and gear lathes. Milling workers Pang Hongjun, Liu Zhongqin, Zhang Jimin, etc. each watched two milling gears. Reasonable quotas and a wage system of more pay for more work are stimulating the creation of various new records, making this movement expand more broadly and deeply.

    运动开始以前
    生产不能完成计划产品材料浪费浩大
    为了改变这种情况，机械局于七月间协同东北总工会和工薪实习团下厂帮助工作。经深入调查研究后，他们首先纠正了领导上认为“生产积极，思想落后”的错误观点。同时发动工人进行工时标定，创造缩短工时纪录这一打开运动之门的方法，计划通过这个途径初步解决工人运动，工资制度，工厂管理三个问题。
  工人自动缩短工时打开局面
    运动开始先经过较深入的思想教育，反复地通过访问、上课、座谈，解除了工人群众中普遍存在着的不愿拿出全部技能的种种顾虑，特别是对厂内那些背着“政治落后”包袱的老技工，进行了恳切的交谈和动员后，工人思想酝酿成熟，工会号召工人起来自报缩短工时，当场报名者一五五人。接着便以第一工作部为重点进行劳动时间测定。首先在党员张尚举划线小组和团员赵国有的车塔轮上进行试验，取得首次成绩。他们的纪录被黑板报，捷报和标定红旗传扬全厂。于是创纪录的运动便由一个车间扩大到各车间，由一两个先进分子扩展到一百三十余人，由点到面地形成了热潮。并由提高劳动强度创造新纪录，进而与改进工具和操作技术的合理化建议结合，先后出现了赵国有三次改良车塔轮的工具，和创造车铣结合的操作方法，张尚举划线小组改车床为躺镟，一个月内有十八件合理化建议被采纳并普遍传播开来。
    新纪录不断涌现，劳动生产率数倍地在提高着。九月份生产计划制造六英尺车床三十台，但结果完成了四十五台。并使做一台的工时，由二三一点二工缩减到一五三工。在生产过程中，工会一面组织工人制订个人和车间的周密的生产计划，一面更代表工人同行政上签订了集体合同，并在合同中拟定了集体的超额奖励办法。同时为保证各车间生产序列之衔接，又制订了车间与车间之间的联系合同。通过集体合同把创新纪录运动引向有组织地为完成一个计划而战斗，对新纪录运动起了组织推动和监督鼓励的作用，而集体超额奖励又给工人的劳动热忱以物质的保证。使这次紧张的生产战斗取得了全胜。
    从这次比较精密计划的生产过程中，已可找出接近实际的制造一台车床的工时定额。在每个车间对每个件品加工过程，进行数次重复的工时标定，求得平均的时间，经过与工人的研讨取得工人同意，行政上便确定了产品数量和工时的定额，至此，创纪录运动便引向了定额管理。在这个基础上，研究执行个人超额奖励的工薪制，代替前此的集体超额奖励办法。由于个人超额奖励制的实行，十月初，创纪录运动又向着更高阶段发展——相继出现了看车床台数的新纪录，如阎英臣、张如庥、林振华各带一名徒弟看三台铣牙轮床子，铣工庞洪均、刘仲勤、张济民等一人看两台铣牙轮等。合理的定额，多劳多酬的工资制度，正在刺激着各种新纪录的产生，使这一运动在广度及深度上更加扩展。
