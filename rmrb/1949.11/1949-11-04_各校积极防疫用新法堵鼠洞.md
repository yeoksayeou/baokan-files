　　Various Schools Actively Prevent Epidemics, Using New Methods to Block Rat Holes

　　[Special Dispatch] Various major universities and middle schools in Beijing have successively launched epidemic prevention work. Huabei University, China University of Political Science and Law, Fu Jen Catholic University, Beijing Normal University, Mu Zhen Girls' High School, and Beijing No. 1 Middle School have successively established epidemic prevention committees. Ma Chengqi, Deputy Secretary of the CPC Committee of Huabei University, personally served as the director of the Prevention Committee. At the inaugural meeting, he emphasized: "Epidemic prevention is like warfare. We must not only block it, but more importantly, eliminate it." While using words, lectures, and movies to publicize the hazards of the plague and prevention methods to the entire school, and universally implementing vaccination, all schools have also launched clean-up campaigns. Faculty and students of Huabei University cleaned all the living rooms and sprinkled lime. Mu Zhen also thoroughly cleaned classrooms, kitchens, and dining halls on the afternoon of the third. In the rat-catching campaign, everyone researched many methods: Beijing Normal University used chili mud (some schools used hair) to block rat holes, so that rats could no longer dig the hole open. To cooperate with the above work, all schools are trying their best to reduce large gatherings and activities. Beijing No. 1 Middle School's planned trip on the 5th has been decided to be stopped; Beijing Normal University's school anniversary (8th), which was originally planned to be expanded to celebrate, inviting parents of students and alumni from previous years, has also been changed to a celebration for students within the school. In order to promptly understand the situation of the plague in Chahar Province and collect epidemic prevention materials from various sources, in addition to promptly listening to the daily broadcasts, Beijing Normal University also cut out epidemic prevention texts from newspapers and posted them in the vicinity of the school, literacy classes, and workers' night schools. Beijing No. 1 Middle School decided to subscribe to a copy of the People's Daily for each class starting from the first of this month.

　　各校积极防疫用新法堵鼠洞
    【本报讯】京市各大中学校相继展开防疫工作。华大、政法大学、辅大以及北师、慕贞、市一中等校已先后成立防疫委员会。中共华大校党委副书记马诚齐亲任防委会主任。他在成立会上强调指出：“防疫就是作战。不仅要挡住它，更要紧的是消灭它。”各校在用文字、口头、电影等向全校宣传鼠疫的危害性与防预方法，并普遍实行疫苗防疫注射的同时，也都展开了清洁卫生运动。华大的教职学员们扫除了所有的住室，撒上了石灰。慕贞也在三日下午彻底的打扫了课堂、厨房和饭厅。在捕鼠运动中，大家研究了很多办法：北师以辣椒泥（有的学校则用头发）堵塞鼠洞，使老鼠不能再把洞门掏开。为配合上述工作，各校更尽力减少大的集会与活动。市一中原定在五日的旅行，已决定停止；北师校庆（八日）本拟扩大庆祝，招待学生家长与历年毕业的同学，也已改为校内同学的庆祝会。各校为及时的了解察北鼠疫情况与多方面的搜集防疫材料，除及时的收听当日广播外，北师更剪圈报纸上的防疫文字，在学校附近及识字班、工人夜校张贴。市一中更决定自本月一日起给每班订一份人民日报。
