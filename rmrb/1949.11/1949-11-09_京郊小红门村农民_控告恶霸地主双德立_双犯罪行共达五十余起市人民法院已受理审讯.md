　　Farmers of Xiaohongmen Village in the Suburbs of Beijing
  　Accuse Local Tyrant and Landlord Shuang Deli
    Shuang's Crimes Total Over Fifty; Municipal People's Court Has Accepted the Case and Begun Trial
    [Beijing News] Farmer representatives from Xiaohongmen Village in the 14th District of this city have accused local tyrant and landlord Shuang Deli in court. Since land reform began in the village in early September this year, farmers have been reporting Shuang Deli's crimes to the Farmers' Association Preparatory Committee. After a denunciation meeting on September 13th, they formally filed a complaint with the Beijing Municipal People's Court. The court opened the trial at 10:00 AM yesterday (the 8th), presided over by Judge He Zhanhua. Twelve farmer representatives attended as plaintiffs, including the director of the Xiaohongmen Village Farmers' Association, the village head, the residents' group leader, and witnesses. After the court session began, the farmer representatives separately accused Shuang Deli of his crimes. The accused had served as a puppet Baozhang (community leader) for more than ten years, from 1937 to the liberation of Beijing. He colluded with Japanese invaders and Kuomintang reactionaries to oppress and exploit, embezzle, and extort from local farmers, earning him the nickname "Sea Emperor." His uncles Shuang Yong and Shuang Wu, nicknamed "Double Tyrants" and "Crouching Emperor," dominated Xiaohongmen for eleven years. The accused originally owned thirteen mu of land, but later used his position to requisition labor, collect vehicle tolls, embezzle conscription fees under the guise of drafting soldiers, buy and sell conscripts, and embezzle donations under the pretext of building schools, and forcibly purchased farmers' properties and land at low prices, thereby increasing his land holdings to over one hundred mu. An old hired hand of the accused, Gao Shun, was beaten to death for accidentally causing the loss of a domestic animal, after which the body was secretly buried. The accused's hired hand, Han Dezhen, was kidnapped by bandits, but the accused refused to pay the ransom, resulting in his execution by the bandits. Poor farmers Gao Wenyuan and Zhao Binggeng both died as a result of intimidation and fear caused by Shuang Deli. Including other offenses, there were more than fifty crimes in total. The farmer representatives demanded that the People's Court severely punish the accused according to the law. After hearing the accusations from the farmer representatives, the judge brought the accused to trial. The accused initially tried to cunningly deny his crimes, but after the farmers pointed them out one by one, the two criminals, fearing punishment, begged for mercy from the judge and the farmer representatives. The trial concluded at 4:00 PM, and the court adjourned.
