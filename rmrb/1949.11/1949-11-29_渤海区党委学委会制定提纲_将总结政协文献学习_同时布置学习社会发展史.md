The Study Committee General Association formulated a summary outline, which is divided into four categories: First, what is the understanding of the following issues after studying the CPPCC documents? The issues include the significance of the united front to the Chinese revolution, and how to correctly grasp the strategic policy of the united front from the experience of the party's historical development and current actual struggle; the formation and significance of the great unity of the people of the whole country, and why the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is the best organizational form of the Chinese people's democratic united front, etc. Second, what changes have taken place in practical actions (including work style, ideological understanding, learning attitude, etc.) after studying the CPPCC documents. Third, how has the understanding of specific issues such as the people's democratic united front, the people's democratic dictatorship, "leaning to one side," and uniting international friends been improved, and what problems still exist now. Fourth, learning situation, steps, methods, emotions, experience, etc. It was also decided that each study sub-association should complete the summary before the 24th of this month and submit a written report to the Study Committee General Association. The meeting unanimously agreed that two basic issues must be grasped in the summary: that is, the issues of the people's democratic dictatorship and "leaning to one side" must be summarized from specific examples. Finally, the Study Committee General Association announced that theoretical study would begin on the 20th of this month, first studying "A Brief History of Social Development" for two and a half months. The study plan will be drafted and announced by the Study Committee General Association. Currently, each sub-association is conducting the summary.
