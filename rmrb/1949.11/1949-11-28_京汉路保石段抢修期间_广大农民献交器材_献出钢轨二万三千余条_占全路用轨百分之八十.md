　　【Baoding News】During the emergency repairs of the Baoding-Shijiazhuang section of the Beijing-Hankou Railway, the broad masses of farmers along both sides of the line enthusiastically donated old railway equipment they had stored. Farmers from the three special districts of Baoding, Dingxian, and Shijiazhuang donated a total of 23,458 steel rails, accounting for 80% of the 29,200 rails needed for the entire section; they also donated 3,770 screws, 2,729 spikes, 1,729 fishplates, and 2,944 other railway equipment parts such as insulators and tie plates, which played a significant role in the restoration of the section. In the initial stages of the repairs, steel rails were extremely scarce, with only 99 rails remaining in the entire section, barely enough to repair 30 kilometers. To ensure the completion of the project, the First Engineering Office in charge of the repairs established close contact with the people's governments of the special districts along the route and jointly established a road construction committee. Staff at the eleven equipment collection stations set up along the way went to the countryside to cooperate with district and village cadres in carrying out propaganda, calling on farmers to donate railway equipment to the state for railway construction. The people, who had long hoped for the resumption of traffic, were very happy to hear the news of the railway repairs and actively retrieved the track parts they had dismantled in the past from underground, rivers, and mountain gullies, transporting them to the railway with their own ox carts, mule carts, and handcarts. Farmers in Dongrun Village, Dingxian County, voluntarily went to the district office and donated eight rails. Farmers in Xinle County donated a total of 3,836 rails. During the continuous heavy rains in the summer, when the roads became so muddy that large carts could not travel, farmers in Xushui transported steel rails by boat. Farmers in Anxin retrieved 400 steel rails from water more than two zhang deep. The transportation of railway equipment for this section involved the immense strength of over 40,000 man-days, over 20,000 large carts, and 40,000 head of livestock from the farmers along the route, making a significant contribution to the restoration of this section of the railway and resolving the majority of the equipment shortage.

　　京汉路保石段抢修期间
  　广大农民献交器材
    献出钢轨二万三千余条  占全路用轨百分之八十
    【保定讯】京汉铁路保（定）石（家庄）段抢修期间，沿路两侧广大农民热烈献交旧存的铁路器材。保定、定县、石家庄三个专区的农民，共献出钢轨两万三千四百五十八条，占全段两万九千二百条的百分之八十；并献出螺丝三千七百七十个，道钉二千七百二十九个，鱼尾板一千七百二十九块，其他磁瓶、塾板等各种铁路器材零件共二千九百四十四件，对该段的修复起了很大作用。该段在抢修初期钢轨极为缺乏，全段钢轨仅剩了九十九条，经东拚西凑刚刚能修三十余公里。为保证此段工程的完成，抢修该段的第一工程处，即与沿路各专区人民政府取得了密切联系，共同成立了筑路委员会，沿途并建立了十一个器材搜集站，各站工作人员均下乡配合区、村干部向农民进行宣传，号召把铁路器材献出交给国家修筑铁路。久望通车的人民，听到抢修铁路的消息后，十分高兴，纷纷将过去拆毁的道轨零件从地下、河里、山沟里找出来，用自己的牛车、骡车、人力车运到铁路上去。定县东闰村农民自动找到区公所献出了八根道轨，新乐县农民共献出道轨三千八百三十六条。当夏季大雨连绵时，道路泥泞得大车不能送，徐水农民用船运钢轨。安新农民从两丈多深的水里捞出钢轨四百条。此段铁路器材的运送，沿路农民用了四万多个人工，两万多辆大车，四万头牲畜的浩大力量，对此段铁路的修复付出了很大贡献，解决了器材缺乏的大部困难。
