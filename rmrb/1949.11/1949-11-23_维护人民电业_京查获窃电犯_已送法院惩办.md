　　Beijing Uncovers Electricity Thieves
　　Sent to Court for Punishment
    [Our Newspaper] The North China Electric Power Beijing Branch uncovered two professional electricity thieves and has sent them to the People's Court for investigation and handling. One of them, Wang Muyao, residing at No. 51 Mishi Hutong, Outer Fourth District, specialized in stealing electricity for others. He was apprehended by the 12th Police Station of the Outer Fourth Precinct on September 22nd. According to Wang's confession, he had stolen electricity for more than ten households. When these ten-plus households were summoned to the Outer Fourth Precinct for questioning, some of them had already recognized after liberation that they should not steal electricity, and were released. Nine households that continued to steal electricity after liberation have been transferred by the Outer Fourth Precinct to the People's Court for investigation and handling. Furthermore, on November 8th, the company's inspection department uncovered another professional electricity thief, Li Yaoting, who was also transferred to the court for joint investigation and handling. In addition to recovering electricity fees from the electricity-stealing households in accordance with regulations, the company requested the People's Court to severely punish the professional electricity thieves Wang Muyao and Li Yaoting, who specialized in stealing electricity for others, in order to safeguard and develop the people's electricity industry.
