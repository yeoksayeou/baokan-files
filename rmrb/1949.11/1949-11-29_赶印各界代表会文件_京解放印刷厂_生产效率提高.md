　　Rushing to Print Documents for All-Circles Representatives Conference
  　Beijing Liberation Printing Factory
  　Production Efficiency Improves
    [Beijing News] The Liberation Printing Factory rushed to print documents for the Second Beijing Municipal People's Representatives Conference of All Circles, setting a new record. In three days, they completed the typesetting and printing of 317,150 characters of conference documents, including more than 20 types of laborious forms. The final day's draft proposals, totaling more than 50,000 characters, took only five hours from type selection to binding. The revised稿 of over 54,000 characters, which was more than double the word count of the former Beijing Liberation Daily, took only two-thirds of the time to typeset. It is estimated that the overall efficiency is three times higher than when printing the Liberation Daily, and ten times higher than the efficiency during the Kuomintang reactionary rule. The day and night shifts are overlapping, and the working hours of general workers are around 14 hours. Some individual workers have worked continuously for as long as 30 hours.

    【北京讯】解放印刷厂赶印北京市第二届各界人民代表会议文件，创造新纪录，三天之内，完成了排印三十一万七千一百五十字的大会文件，其中有费工的表格二十多种，最后一天的提案初稿五万多字，从检字到装订仅用五小时；复稿五万四千多字，比前北京解放报字数多一倍，而排印时间则仅占该报排印时间的三分之二。估计，其总效率较排印解放报时提高三倍，较国民党反动派统治时期的效率则高出十倍。昼夜班接替是交叉的，一般工人的工作时间都在十四小时左右。个别工人有连续工作达三十小时之久的。
