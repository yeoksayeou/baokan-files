　　The Foremost "Good Deed"
    ——Written on the Beijing People's Representative Conference's Resolution to Close Brothels
    Wū Sā

    Today, in the people's Beijing, this sinful system that insulted and ravaged women has been destroyed! This barbaric and cruel, filthy hell has been eradicated; today, in the people's Beijing, the People's Representative Conference, with a voice of justice, sentenced this bestial, barbaric system to death. For thousands of years, this sinful and barbaric system has murdered countless women; for thousands of years, this sinful and barbaric system has poisoned the health of the people with terrible gonorrhea and syphilis. This malignant tumor of feudal society, this malignant tumor of capitalist society, the development of science and medicine was powerless to stop its festering, while feudal rulers and bureaucratic capitalists maintained its existence, accelerating its decay. But today, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, in the people's Beijing, this sinful tumor has been cut away with one stroke.

    Today, the women who were forced into the fire pit by exploitation and hunger; today, the women who were abducted and trafficked into this hell; their days of suffering are over, their days of being insulted and ravaged are over; today, they have jumped out of the fire pit, they have become human beings again. Human, what a dignified title! They have become human beings again, what a joyous thing!

    From today on, they will earn a living by labor; from today on, they will live a life of human dignity, what a joyous thing!

    The Communist Party, Chairman Mao, is the bright sun, the judge of all darkness and sin, the cleaner of all filth and ugliness, the guardian of mankind; it is the Communist Party that has eliminated the insult and ravage of people, it is the Communist Party that has restored the dignity and nobility of people; and today, it is you—the people's representatives of Beijing—who, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, have passed this great resolution and done the foremost "good deed."

    Today is the beginning; tomorrow, we will destroy all the living hells on the earth; tomorrow, we will make everyone live a glorious and happy life.

　　头等的“善事”
    ——为北京市人民代表会议封闭妓院决议而作
    乌撒
    今天，在人民的北京，这侮辱、蹂躏妇女的罪恶制度被摧毁了！这野蛮残酷的、污秽的地狱被铲除了；今天，在人民的北京，人民代表会议以正义的声音，宣判了这兽性的，野蛮制度的死刑。几千年来，这罪恶的野蛮制度，坑杀了千千万万的妇女；几千年来，这罪恶的野蛮制度以可怕的淋病、梅毒毒害着人民的健康；这封建社会的毒瘤，这资本主义社会的毒瘤，科学、医学的发达，曾无力阻止它的溃烂，而封建统治者和官僚资本家们，却要维持着它的存在，加速着它的溃烂。但是今天，在共产党及人民政府的领导下，在人民的北京，这罪恶的毒瘤被一刀割掉了。
    今天，被剥削，饥饿逼着跳入火坑的女人；今天，被拐骗贩卖进入这地狱的女人；她们苦难的日子完了，她们被侮辱与蹂躏的日子完了；今天，她们跳出了火坑，她们重新作了人。人，这是多么尊严的称呼！她们重新作了人，这是多么可喜的事！
    从今天起，她们将靠劳动为生；从今天起，她们将过着人的尊严的生活，这是多么可喜的事！
    共产党，毛主席，是光明的太阳，是一切黑暗罪恶的法官，是一切污秽丑恶的清扫人，是人类的守护神；是共产党消除了对于人的侮辱与蹂躏，是共产党恢复了人的尊严与崇高；而今天，是你们——北京市的人民代表们，在共产党及人民政府的领导下，通过了这伟大的决议，做了头等的“善事”。
    今天，是开始；明天，要摧毁全地球上的活地狱；明天，要使一切人都过着光荣幸福的生活。
