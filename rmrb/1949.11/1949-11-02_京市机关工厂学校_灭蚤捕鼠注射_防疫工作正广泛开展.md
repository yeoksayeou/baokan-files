　　[Beijing News] The Beijing Municipal Epidemic Prevention Committee's Municipal Government Branch was established yesterday (1st). More than 30 representatives from various bureaus and departments, as well as the Finance Committee, Housing Management Committee, Hui People's Work Committee, Suburban Work Committee, Cooperative General Office, People's Court, and People's Bank, met at the Municipal Government yesterday afternoon. Zhang Wenqi, Deputy Director of the Municipal Epidemic Prevention Committee, and Chao Jinwen, Director of the Municipal Government Administrative Office, reported on the plague situation and the city's epidemic prevention organization, calling on everyone to mobilize and actively carry out the epidemic prevention campaign. A standing committee of five units—the Administrative Office, the Health Bureau, the Public Security Bureau, the Finance Bureau, and the Education Bureau—was elected. Under the standing committee, two departments were established: Cleaning and Hygiene, and Propaganda and Inspection. It was also decided that each administrative unit should quickly establish branch committees, and hygiene groups should be established under the branch committees.
    [Beijing News] State-owned factories in Beijing are actively carrying out epidemic prevention work. Most have established epidemic prevention committees and are widely carrying out flea extermination, rat catching, and inoculation against plague.
    All employees of the Yanjing Paper Mill have received masks and are being successively inoculated with plague prevention vaccines (including family members). A thorough cleaning has also been carried out, with several years' worth of dirt being removed from under the machines.
    The Beijing Automobile Repair Factory convened a meeting of all employees on the 31st of last month to explain the purpose and methods of plague prevention. After the meeting, a thorough cleaning of the factory was carried out, D.D.T. was sprayed, and lime was spread. All furniture in the kitchen was disinfected, and hot water was prepared in the morning and evening for factory workers to wash their clothes. The factory's Party, government, and labor union have established an inspection committee to check the factory's prevention equipment at any time.
    Since the 31st, only those with official business have been allowed to enter the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant. Yesterday (1st), a general epidemic prevention association was established, and epidemic prevention committees have also been formed in various residential areas. It was decided to begin vaccinating all employees this morning. Preparations are being made to use sixty tons of lime and one hundred kilograms of carbolic acid to scrub and spread in the rooms. Employees are being mobilized to kill stray dogs, and research is being conducted to manufacture rat traps.
    The No. 70 Arsenal's epidemic prevention committee was established yesterday (1st). A meeting of all employees was convened in the afternoon to explain epidemic prevention matters. Preparations are now being made to carry out publicity, spray carbolic acid in factory buildings and dormitories, and block rat holes.
    In order to prevent the plague, the Beijing Clothing Factory began restricting personnel from entering and leaving the factory on October 28th during the period of suspension of work pending materials. During the suspension period, wages were paid at 85% of the original salary. Epidemic prevention committees or epidemic prevention groups have been established in both the general and branch factories. Isolation rooms have also been prepared in case of emergency.
    In addition, the Agricultural Machinery General Factory, the People's Printing Factory, and the People's Paper Mill have all held meetings of all employees, calling on them to pay attention to cleanliness and hygiene. The People's Printing Factory has also installed rat traps in the factory buildings.
    [This Newspaper] Fu Jen Catholic University and the Affiliated High School of Beijing Normal University have launched epidemic prevention work. Fu Jen University has already ordered vaccines from the Temple of Heaven Epidemic Prevention Office and is preparing to administer them. The Affiliated High School of Beijing Normal University has established an epidemic prevention committee, and epidemic prevention groups have been established in each class and student dormitory. Both schools will hold school-wide clean-up and rat and flea extermination campaigns.
