　　Beijing Shelters Nearly Three Thousand Beggars
  　Has Separately Arranged Labor Production
    [Beijing News] Beijing's work of sheltering beggars has achieved initial success, with a total of two thousand nine hundred and thirty-five people sheltered. The majority of the young and middle-aged have been reformed and participated in labor production, while the elderly, weak, and disabled have also been appropriately resettled. Beijing was under the reactionary rule of feudal bureaucrats, Japanese puppets, and the Kuomintang bandit gangs for a long time in the past, leaving behind a large number of unemployed and displaced people who became beggars, with extremely complex compositions. Not long after the liberation of Beijing, the municipal government began to shelter beggars. Before the convening of the first session of the Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference, one thousand two hundred and forty-eight people had been sheltered. After the first session of the Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference, the Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau, in accordance with the resolution of the conference, continued to shelter one thousand six hundred and eighty-seven people. When sheltering beggars, the People's Government, on the one hand, provided shelter and education, and on the other hand, organized labor, giving different treatments to different types of beggars. The elderly, weak, and disabled who could not work were directly sent to the Homes for the Aged, and the rest were sent to the Relief Institute. After review, those who could return to their hometowns were helped to return to their hometowns for production as much as possible; the rest were then distributed to various shelters. Children aged eight to fifteen were sent to orphanages to study. Young and middle-aged women were sent to women's reformatories to learn sewing and other handicrafts. Young and middle-aged men, after education, were sent to the Civilian Vocational Training Center to learn handicrafts if they had families who could not leave Beijing. The rest were formed into labor brigades to go to designated locations to participate in labor production. There are now four labor brigades, a total of six hundred and ninety-four people, who have successively gone to the Yellow River to repair dikes, to Chahar Province to reclaim wasteland, and to Inner Mongolia to cut wood.
    Currently, there are a total of one thousand seven hundred and eighty-one people in various shelters. Relief institutes, homes for the aged, orphanages, women's reformatories, civilian vocational training centers, etc., have gradually moved onto the right track and started production. For example, the Relief Institute now has one hundred and eleven people, engaged in printing, weaving, weaving towels, weaving socks, and other production, and is already self-sufficient. More than one thousand and ten people in the Homes for the Aged, two hundred of whom can also engage in flour milling, making shoe soles, weaving straw sandals, straw mats, cattail bags, weaving felt, and shaking coal. Most of the women in the women's reformatory have joined the newly built clothing factory to work.
    Each person in each shelter can receive twenty-eight taels of millet per day (including food expenses), two meals a day, and the food can be improved during festivals. In winter, each person receives cotton clothes, cotton quilts, cotton shoes, and cotton hats. There are fixed times for eating, working, sleeping, and visiting every day. Each shelter has doctors and nurses to provide them with medical treatment. At the end of the month, all those who participate in production can receive pocket money to use. After participating in labor and receiving education, many people have begun to awaken. They have realized the glory of labor and the shame of parasitism. Therefore, some beggars persuade others to come to the shelter, some children and old people also want to join the labor brigade to reclaim wasteland, and some old beggars persuade their children to join the labor brigade. At the reception before the departure of the labor brigade, activists spoke on the spot, guaranteeing the completion of the task on schedule, and the production mood was very high.

　　京收容乞丐近三千人
  　已分别安置劳动生产
    【北京讯】北京市收容乞丐工作获初步成绩，前后共收容了二千九百三十五人，其中青壮年大部已获得改造，参加劳动生产，老弱残废亦已适当安置。北京市过去长期处在封建官僚及日伪和国民党匪帮的反动统治下，遗留下大批失业流亡人员，沦为乞丐，成份极为复杂。北京解放不久，市政府即已开始进行收容乞丐工作。京市第一届各界人民代表会议召开以前，已收容一千二百四十八名。北京市第一届各界人民代表会议后，市政府民政局根据大会决议案，又继续收容了一千六百八十七人。人民政府在收容乞丐时，一方面收容教育，一方面组织劳动，对各种乞丐，给以各种不同的处理，对不能生产的老弱残废，直接送至安老所，其余一律送到救济院。经过审查后，凡能回籍者，尽量帮助其回籍生产；其余的再分配到各收容单位。八岁至十五岁儿童送育幼所学习。青壮年妇女送妇女教养所学习缝纫等手艺。青壮年男子，经过教育后，除有家不能离开北京的到平民习艺所学习手艺外，余均编成劳动大队，赴指定地点，参加劳动生产。现已有四批劳动大队，共六百九十四人先后分赴黄河修堤、察省开荒、内蒙伐木。
    目前各收容所共有一千七百八十一人，救济院、安老所、育幼所、妇女教养所、平民习艺所等大部已渐渐步入正轨，开始生产。如救济院现有一百十一人，分别从事印刷、织布、织毛巾、织袜子等生产，已能自给自足。安老所一千零十余人中有二百人也可从事磨面、纳鞋底、编草鞋、草垫、蒲包、织毡、摇煤等生产。妇女教养所大部妇女已参加到新建被服厂作工。
    各收容所每人每日可领到小米二十八两（菜金在内），每日两餐，每逢节日等还可改善伙食。冬季每人发棉衣、棉被、棉鞋、棉帽。每日有固定时间吃饭、工作、睡觉、会客。各容收所都有医生、护士给他们诊疗。到月底，凡生产的人都可以分到零钱使用。经过参加劳动与受到教育后，很多人都开始觉悟了，他们认识了劳动的光荣，寄生的耻辱。因此有的乞丐劝别人到收容所来，有的儿童及老人也想参加劳动大队去开荒，有的老乞丐说服自己的子弟去参加劳动大队。在劳动大队出发前的招待会上，当场有积极分子讲话，保证如期完成任务，生产情绪很高。
