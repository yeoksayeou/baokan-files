　　A Visit with North Korean Representative Choi Ho-min
    Zhang Jia Chi
    "When an ordinary worker in North Korea enjoys his annual vacation at the famous Mount Kumgang resort, the workers in South Korea are starving and wandering the streets of Seoul or Busan, or trembling in dark workshops and mines, enduring endless sixteen-hour workdays for meager wages that are not enough to keep them fed and clothed. What persuasive power do all the lies of imperialism have then?" After my visit with Choi Ho-min, the Secretary-General of the North Korean General Federation of Trade Unions and representative to the Asian-Australasian Trade Union Conference, this thought lingered in my mind for a long time. Indeed, the two countries – one a socialist Soviet federation, the other an imperialist United States of America – offer two vastly different influences on the Korean people, and there is no better fact that possesses such eloquent power.

    The following is a picture drawn by the North Korean representative comparing the lives of the working class in the two Koreas:

    During the era of Japanese fascist rule, the Korean working class had no political rights to speak of. Even three workers talking together were subject to surveillance. Their lives were unspeakably miserable. However, the Korean working class did not give up any opportunity to wage various illegal struggles against the Japanese fascist bandits. It was not until August 15, 1945, when the Soviet Red Army entered Korea, that the Korean people gained the right to engage in all political activities. But soon after, the U.S. military, in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement, occupied the southern half of Korea, south of the 38th parallel, and the Korean people began to live two completely different lives.

    With the assistance of the Soviet Red Army, the people of North Korea confiscated the property of enemies and puppets, established a democratic government, and implemented a series of democratic reforms, completely freeing themselves from the shackles of imperialism and feudal landlords, and began to create their own happiness with their own hands. Although the enemy's destruction was extremely cruel, with almost all factories and mines destroyed as the enemy retreated, the creativity of the liberated North Korean working class was great. The first national economic construction plan in 1947 was completed at 102.9 percent, followed by the completion of the second one-year plan in 1948 at 115 percent. This year, a two-year national economic construction plan has been formulated. To date, all the factories and mines in North Korea that were destroyed by the Japanese invaders have been restored to their former levels. Moreover, in some sectors, they have already surpassed them. This has laid a preliminary foundation for the Korean national economy.

    Under the democratic government, the working class of North Korea freely organized their own trade unions, and under their own trade union organizations, carried out universal worker education, welfare, and recreational activities. In all factory and mine trade unions, worker clubs, democratic propaganda rooms (for meetings and study), libraries, and other facilities have been established, as well as various worker cultural troupes for music, drama, and dance. Workers' political and cultural education is carried out in accordance with the unified study outline of the General Federation of Trade Unions, which enables the planned improvement of workers' political and cultural levels. The democratic government attaches great importance to the cultural life of workers, and allocates cultural and educational funds to each factory's workers, accounting for 3 to 5 percent of the total wage. Because workers can universally enjoy cultural life, many excellent worker literary and artistic creations have emerged. Therefore, Choi Ho-min said, "North Korean workers are not only the masters of the country politically and economically, but also culturally."

    The North Korean trade unions play a role in guaranteeing the correct implementation of government decrees, and most importantly, lead the workers in completing the national economic construction plan. The trade unions launched challenge competitions between factories, and passed on production technology through grassroots organizations, thus ensuring the completion of the production plan. In the few years of economic construction, tens of thousands of labor heroes have been rewarded by the government. This year, the Supreme People's Assembly decided to award meritorious medals to 250 outstanding labor heroes because they not only overfulfilled their own production targets, but also took the lead in conservation, set an example with new labor attitudes, and passed on their skills to others.

    The democratic government protects the lives of workers with laws. Since the promulgation of the Labor Law on June 24, 1946, it has guaranteed a general eight-hour working day for workers, prohibited the employment of children under the age of fourteen, stipulated a six-hour working day for adolescent workers aged fourteen to sixteen, and a seven-hour working day for workers in underground dangerous work. At the same time, an annual two-week vacation system was implemented. The government has turned the national summer resorts, formerly owned by Japanese imperialists, pro-Japanese traitors, and landlords, into sanatoriums for workers, where workers can spend their vacations comfortably and free of charge. The Labor Law stipulates the universal implementation of labor insurance and equal pay for equal work. Sick workers receive completely free treatment, and family members can also receive subsidies if they are ill. At the same time, the state provides special care for workers engaged in forestry, land reclamation, and mining in remote areas. Their children's education expenses are fully borne by the state, and a compensation system is implemented according to the length of service.

    But what is the situation in South Korea? "In a word: workers have no political rights." All workers' own organizational activities are prohibited. And living and working conditions are particularly miserable. They work between twelve and sixteen hours a day, but wages are so low that they cannot afford clothing or housing. Due to the American imperialists' policy of destroying the Korean national industrial economy, the number of factories in operation is less than one-third of what it was during the era of Japanese rule. This has filled the streets of South Korean cities with unemployed workers. According to their official statistics, there are three million unemployed workers.

    In addition to economic aggression, American imperialists are employing even more barbaric methods to deprive the South Korean people of their human rights and freedoms. Arrests and massacres have become commonplace. In the four years since the U.S. occupation of South Korea, it is estimated that more than 93,000 Korean people have been massacred, and it is unknown how many are imprisoned in prisons. Two Koreas – one building peace, one committing terror and murder – are presented to the Korean people in such vivid colors. What nonsense can American imperialism and Syngman Rhee still spout? When the people have seen their own future and demand to take their destiny back into their own hands, no imperialist conspiracies or armed aggression can stop them. The people of South Korea have not succumbed. The more brutal the American imperialists and their puppet Syngman Rhee government are in killing the people, the more intense the people's struggle against them becomes. The struggle of the South Korean people has developed into armed uprisings. People's guerrilla activities cover the entire South Korea, except for the vicinity of the capital Seoul and a few other major urban strongholds. The National Council of South Korea still leads the working class of South Korea, bravely persisting in underground struggle under conditions more arduous than those under Japanese imperialist rule. Although the imperialists and their agents are still struggling frantically, their fate of destruction has been determined.

    Choi Ho-min said forcefully in the end: "We have full confidence in our struggle, and believe that in the near future, we will surely drive away American imperialism and achieve the unification and independence of Korea. Because we believe that our struggle is not isolated, we are supported by the world's forces of peace and democracy, and by the help of class brothers from various countries united under the International Federation of Trade Unions."

　　朝鲜代表崔浩敏访问记
    张家炽
    “当北朝鲜的一个普通工人，在全国有名的金刚山避暑胜地享受他一年一度的休假期的时候，而南朝鲜的工人正饥饿地踯躅在汉城或釜山的街头，或正在黑暗的工房矿洞中战战兢兢地为了不够温饱的一点工资而忍受着十六小时的永不休止的工作。一切帝国主义的谎言还有什么说服人的力量呢？”在我访问了亚澳工会会议的代表、北朝鲜总工会秘书长崔浩敏之后，脑子里长久回绕着这样一个想法，的确两个国家——一个社会主义的苏维埃联邦，一个帝国主义的美利坚合众国——给朝鲜人民的两种迥然不同的影响，实在没有更好的事实，能富有如此雄辩的力量了。
    以下就是北朝鲜代表所描划的两个朝鲜的工人阶级生活对比的图画：
    在日本法西斯统治时代，朝鲜工人阶级是谈不到什么政治权利的，甚至三个工人在一块说话都要受到监视。生活更是说不出来的悲惨。但朝鲜的工人阶级并未放弃任何一个机会跟日本法西斯强盗作各种非法的斗争。直到一九四五年“八·一五”，苏联红军进入朝鲜，朝鲜人民才获得一切政治活动的权利。但不久，美军按波茨坦协定占领北纬三十八度以南半个朝鲜，朝鲜人民开始过着两种绝然不同的生活。
    北朝鲜人民在苏联红军协助下，没收了敌伪财产，建立了民主政权，并实行了一系列的民主改革，完全解脱了帝国主义与封建地主的束缚，开始用自己的双手来创造自己的幸福了。虽然敌人的破坏是十分残忍的，几乎所有的工厂矿山在敌人溃退时破坏了，但解放后的北朝鲜工人阶级的创造力是伟大的，一九四七年第一个恢复国民经济建设计划完成了百分之一百零二点九，紧接着在一九四八年完成了第二个一年计划的百分之一百一十五。今年已订出了两年国民经济建设计划。到目前为止，北朝鲜所有被日寇破坏的工厂矿山全部已恢复到从前的水平。而且，在有些部门中已超过了。因此使朝鲜的国民经济打下了初步基础。
    北朝鲜的工人阶级，在民主政权下，自由地组织起自己的工会，而且在自己的工会组织下，进行了普遍的工人教育，福利，文娱工作。在所有的工厂矿山工会中，都设立了工人俱乐部，民主宣传室（开会、学习之用），图书室等设备，还有音乐、戏剧、舞蹈等各种工人文工团。工人的政治文化教育是按照总工会统一的学习提纲进行的，因此能使工人的政治文化水平有计划地提高。民主政府对工人的文化生活十分重视，发给各厂工人的文教费占全部工资的百分之三到百分之五。由于工人能普遍享受文化生活，已出现了许多优秀的工人文艺创作。因此崔浩敏说：“北朝鲜工人不但在政治经济上是国家的主人，就是在文化上也成了国家的主人。”
    北朝鲜工会对政府法令的正确实行起着保证作用，而最重要的是领导工人完成国家经济建设计划。工会在各厂间发动挑战竞赛，并通过下层组织传授生产技术，因此保证了生产计划的完成。在几年经济建设中，已有数万劳动英雄得到了政府的奖励，今年最高人民议会决定奖给二百五十名杰出的劳动英雄以功劳章，因为他们不但超额完成了自己的生产数字，而且在节约上起带头作用，用新的劳动态度来以身作则，并以自己的技术传授给别人。
    民主政府对工人的生活用法令保障，自一九四六年六月二十四日颁布劳动法令后，保证了一般工人八小时工作制，禁止雇用十四岁以下的童工，规定十四岁到十六岁的未成年工人六小时工作制，和地下危险工作的工人七小时工作制。同时实行了每年两星期休假制。政府将过去为日本帝国主义者，朝奸，地主所有的全国避暑胜地辟为工人的休养所，在休假期间的工人可以免费到这些休养所去舒适地度过他们的假期。劳动法令规定普遍实行劳动保险及同工同酬，患病工人完全免费治疗，家属患病也可以得到补助金。同时国家对在偏僻地区从事林垦、矿山工作的工人有特别的照顾，他们的子女教育费全由国家负担，而且按照工龄实行偿金制。
    可是南朝鲜的情形怎样呢？“一句话：工人没有政治权利”。一切工人自己的组织活动是被禁止的。而生活与工作条件尤其悲惨。每天工作在十二小时到十六小时之间，可是工资低得没有衣着与住屋的保障。由于美帝国主义的破坏朝鲜民族工业经济政策，工厂开工者尚不到日寇统治时代的三分之一。使南朝鲜城市的街头充满了失业的工人，据他们官方统计，失业工人有三百万人。
    除了经济侵略外，美国帝国主义者更采用野蛮的方式来剥夺南朝鲜人民的人权自由，逮捕屠杀成了经常的事。自美国占领南朝鲜以来的四年中估计已屠杀了九万三千多朝鲜人民，监禁在牢狱中的还不知有多少。两个朝鲜——一个和平建设，一个恐怖屠杀，以如此鲜明的色彩，放在朝鲜人民的面前，美国帝国主义和李承晚还胡诌些什么呢？当人民已经看到自己的远景，而要求把命运夺回到自己手里的时候，任何帝国主义的阴谋与武装侵略都阻止不住的。南朝鲜的人民并未屈服，美国帝国主义和它的傀儡李承晚政府对人民的残杀愈凶狠，人民反对他们的斗争愈激烈。南朝鲜人民的斗争已发展到武装起义，人民游击队的活动除了首都汉城附近及其他几个大城市据点外，布满了整个南朝鲜。南朝鲜全国评议会，仍然领导着南朝鲜的工人阶级，在比日本帝国主义统治更艰苦的条件下，英勇的坚持地下斗争。帝国主义者和他的代理人虽然仍在疯狂的挣扎，但他们灭亡的命运是已经确定了的。
    崔浩敏在最后这样有力的说：“我们在自己的斗争中有充分的信心，相信不久的将来一定能赶走美国帝国主义，达到朝鲜的统一和独立。因为我们相信，我们的斗争不是孤立的，我们是得到全世界和平民主力量的支援，和团结在国际工联下各国阶级弟兄的帮助的。”（附图片）
