　　Overview of the Establishment of the Communist Youth League in East China and Its Problems
　　By the Editorial Department Archives
　　The work of establishing the Communist Youth League in the East China Liberated Areas, especially in the old rural areas and new urban areas, has made great progress. According to incomplete statistics, there are approximately 130,000 Youth League members. Under the leadership of the Party, these members have actively promoted various tasks. Currently, the main focus of the work of establishing the Youth League in East China is to correct the tendency of closed-doorism, in order to promote the widespread development of the League.
　　The specific manifestations of closed-doorism are raising the requirements for joining the League and not acting in accordance with the League's charter. Some require League members to meet the standards of probationary Party members, and even those who are already being considered for admission to the Party by the local Party have not yet been approved for admission to the League. In Li Guan Township, Bohai District, five young cadres did not develop a single League member in two months, believing that no young person in the entire township met the requirements for joining the League. In some areas, they nitpick about lifestyle habits while ignoring political conditions. For example, in Jinan, Shandong, cadres consider the number of times young workers go to the theater each month as a condition for whether or not to admit them to the League. Some cadres in Bohai District are afraid of publicly establishing the League, believing that "the League will not work if it is made public"; some cadres in Jinan believe that "the League will not be rare if there are too many members," completely isolating the League from the masses. In addition, they juxtapose the work of establishing the League with the central work, believing that the two cannot be carried out simultaneously, or they clearly combine the work of establishing the League with the central work, but are not good at combining it with the immediate interests of the youth.
　　The main reason for the ideology of closed-doorism is that some Party committees have failed to earnestly convey the central government's policy on establishing the League, or have conveyed it but have not thoroughly checked its implementation, and have not aroused widespread attention in various places. At the Qinggong (Youth Worker) Conference in Bohai District, it was found that one of the reasons why the work of establishing the League in Bohai for half a year had not been better carried out was: "The Central Committee's resolution on establishing the League and the resolutions of the League Congress have not been adequately implemented within the Party throughout the district. Propaganda and education have been limited to the distribution of documents and publicity at several meetings, and there has been a lack of in-depth practical education... To date, many counties and most districts have not clearly understood the idea of the Party building the League in terms of leadership, and they do not sufficiently recognize the important significance of building the League. Some even do not understand why the League should be built and the nature and tasks of the Youth League." Therefore, there were deviations in the understanding of the spirit of the Central Committee's decision on building the League, mainly emphasizing the League's "advanced nature" while ignoring its "mass nature," which led to a restrained working method.
　　In order to mobilize and organize the vast youth forces to participate in various construction tasks, since the East China Youth Work Conference in August, Shandong, Qingdao, Subei, Sunan, Northern Anhui, Zhejiang and other places have successively held youth workers or Youth League meetings, which have greatly promoted the correction of the tendency of closed-doorism and the correct development of the work of establishing the League in East China.
　　First of all, at the meetings in various regions, the Party committees earnestly re-conveyed the Central Committee's decision on establishing the League, the resolutions of the League Congress, and the spirit of the East China Youth Work Conference. The leaders repeatedly discussed with the participants and thoroughly examined the ideological roots of the tendency of closed-doorism, unified the understanding of the cadres, and laid a favorable foundation for further development of the work of the League. In order to make the Party committees at all levels more clearly understand the decisive role of the Party's leadership in the work of establishing the League, the Subei District Party Committee issued a decision on strengthening the leadership of youth work, requiring serious attention to this work, mastering the ideological leadership of youth work cadres, solving their practical difficulties, conducting regular inspections, and reporting regularly, combining general calls with regular supervision.
　　The newly liberated areas continue to expand, and the issue of cadres has also been raised in the work of establishing the League. Party committees at all levels have paid attention to this and are preparing to open short-term training classes to train cadres in rotation, so that they can correctly grasp the policy of establishing the League and vigorously develop the work of establishing the League.

　　华东建团概况及其问题
    本报资料室
    华东解放区的建团工作，特别在老区农村与新区城市，已有很大成绩，据不完全统计，青年团员已达十三万人左右。这些团员在党的领导下积极推动了各项工作。目前华东建团工作主要是纠正关门主义偏向，以推动建团工作普遍展开。
    关门主义的具体表现，是提高入团条件，不按团章规定办事。有的以候补党员的条件要求团员，甚至当地党已准备吸收的分子，团尚未批准入团。渤海区李官乡有五个青年干部，两个月时间没有发展一个团员，认为全乡青年没一人够入团条件。有的地区，则斤斤计较生活习惯，而忽略了政治条件，如山东济宁工作干部，把青年工人每月看戏的次数多少等等也作为是否吸收入团的条件。渤海区有的干部害怕公开建团，认为“团公开了就不起作用”；济南市有的干部认为“团员多了，就不希奇”了，使得团与群众完全隔离。此外把建团工作与中心工作对立起来，认为两者不能同时进行，或明确了结合中心工作进行建团，而又不善于与青年的切身利益结合。
    关门主义思想主要是因为若干党委对中央建团方针未能作认真传达，或者传达了未深入检查贯彻，没有引起各地普遍重视。渤海区青工会议上，即曾检查出渤海半年建团工作没有更好开展的原因之一是：“对于中央建团决议及团代大会的决议在全区党内贯彻不够，宣传教育上只限于文件印发和几次会议上的宣传，而缺乏深入实际教育……迄今有不少的县及大部分的区在领导上对全党建团的思想尚不明确，对建团重要意义认识不足。甚至有的连为什么要建团及青年团的性质任务都不了解”，因此对中央建团决定的精神，了解就有了偏差，主要是片面的强调了团的“先进性”而忽略其“群众性”，就产生了束手束脚的工作方法。
    为了动员与组织广大青年力量，参加各项建设工作，自八月华东青年工作会议后，山东、青岛、苏北、苏南、皖北、浙江等地相继召开了青年工作者或青年团的会议，对于纠正关门主义偏向，正确开展华东的建团工作，起了极大的推动作用。
    首先，各地区的会议上，党委都认真重新传达了中央建团的决议，团代大会决议以及华东青工会议的精神，领导与会者反复讨论，彻底检查了关门主义偏向的思想根源，统一了干部认识，为进一步开展团的工作打下有利基础。苏北区党委为了使所属各级党委更加明确党的领导对于建团工作的决定作用，关发出关于加强青年工作领导的决定，要求严重注意此一工作，掌握青年工作干部的思想领导，解决他们的实际困难，经常检查，定期报告，把一般号召与经常督促结合起来。
    新解放区继续扩大，建团工作上也便提出了干部问题，各级党委已予注意，准备开设短期训练班，轮流调训干部，以期他们能正确掌握建团方针，有力地开展建团工作。
