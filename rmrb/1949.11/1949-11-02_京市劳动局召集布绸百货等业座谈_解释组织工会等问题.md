　　Beijing Labor Bureau Convenes Symposium of Cloth, Silk, Department Store Industries to Explain Issues Such as Organizing Trade Unions
    [Beijing News] In order to enable more than 700 capitalist enterprises in Beijing's cloth, silk, and department store industries to further understand the People's Government's policies of developing production and benefiting both labor and capital, and to dispel some of the concerns currently existing among capitalists, the Beijing Labor Bureau specially convened a symposium for these three industries at the Huale Grand Theater in Beijing at 9:00 a.m. on October 28th. More than 600 capitalists attended; representatives from the Central Finance and Economics Committee, the preparatory committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Municipal Government Research Office, and the three trade associations participated.
    At the beginning of the symposium, Shi Huaibi, Deputy Director of the Municipal Labor Bureau, delivered a speech, explaining the significance of convening this conference. He pointed out that capitalists in Beijing's cloth, silk, and department store industries had concerns and misunderstandings regarding four points in their thinking: "liquidation," organizing trade unions, trading companies, and tax burden. Although the first point of concern has gradually been eliminated, a few capitalists still have this idea, manifested in deliberately withdrawing capital and reducing business. It should be known that under the New Democratic regime, what must be opposed and suppressed are those illegal merchants who engage in speculation and violate policies. Any commerce that is beneficial to economic prosperity and beneficial to the broad masses of the people will be protected and supported. Regarding the issue of organizing trade unions, he said: Only when workers organize trade unions and cooperate with capitalists to actively develop production can the goal of truly benefiting both labor and capital be achieved. Capitalists must also dispel these confused ideas of the past and appropriately improve the lives and welfare of employees. Trading companies should be recognized as one of the main tools of the government to regulate the market and stabilize prices. It is the opposite of the bureaucratic capital of the Kuomintang in essence and is in line with the needs of the broad masses of the people. He hoped that after understanding the policies, capitalists should learn to do business under the New Democratic economic policies. Regarding taxation, he explained that Beijing's taxation after liberation adopts the method of democratic evaluation. In the early stages of establishment, if individual unfair facts occur, specific opinions can be put forward for the tax authorities to correct them in time so that the burden is fair and reasonable. Subsequently, Zhang Chunjiu, Director of the Shop Employees Committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, Su Jing, Secretary Director of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and Zhao Yizhi, representatives of the three trade associations, spoke successively, analyzing and supplementing explanations for the above-mentioned four concerns and misunderstandings of the capitalists.

　　京市劳动局召集布绸百货等业座谈
  　解释组织工会等问题
    【北京讯】北京市劳动局为使本市七百余家布业、绸缎业及百货业的资方，进一步了解人民政府的发展生产、劳资两利政策，解除资方目前存在的一些顾虑，特于十月二十八日上午九时假本市华乐大戏院召集该三业座谈会。到会的资方达六百余人；中央财委会、市总工会筹委会、市商会、市府研究室及三个同业公会，都派有代表参加。
    座谈开始，首由市劳动局史怀璧副局长致词，他说明召开这一大会的意义后指出：本市布业、绸缎业及百货业资方，在思想上对“清算”、组织工会、贸易公司、税收负担等四点存在着顾虑与误解，第一点顾虑虽已渐渐消除，但仍有少数资方存有这种思想，表现在故意抽出资本，缩小营业。应该知道在新民主主义的政权下，所要反对和取缔的是那些投机倒把，违反政策的不法奸商，凡对繁荣经济和有利于人民大众有益的商业，都会得到保护扶植的。关于组织工会问题，他说：只有工人组织工会协同资方积极发展生产，才能达到真正劳资两利的目的，资方也须打消过去这些糊涂思想，适当的改善职工生活和福利待遇。对贸易公司应该认识它是政府调剂市场，平稳物价的主要工具之一，它与国民党的官僚资本在本质上正是相反的，是符合于广大人民需要的。希望资方在了解政策之后，要学会在新民主主义的经济政策下做生意。关于税收，他说明：解放后的北京市税收，是采取民主评议的方式，初期创办，如有个别不公平的事实发生，可以提出具体意见，供税务机关及时纠正，使负担公平合理。继由市总工会店员业委会主任张春久，市商会秘书主任苏敬与及三个同业公会的代表赵一之先后发言，针对上述资方的四种顾虑和误解加以分析和补充解释。
