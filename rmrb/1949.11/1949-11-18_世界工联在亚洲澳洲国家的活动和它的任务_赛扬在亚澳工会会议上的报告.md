　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 17th – The following is the full text of Saillant's report at the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference on "Activities and Tasks of the World Federation of Trade Unions in Asian and Australian Countries":
　　Dear Comrades:
　　This Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference held here in Beijing can be said to be one of the most important and positive actions since the establishment of the World Federation of Trade Unions in October 1945; all those from Asian countries, regardless of gender or age, whether from large cities or rural areas, whether manual or intellectual laborers, warmly express their respect to the conference. The Executive Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions, entrusted by the Second Congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions, pays tribute to the Asian-Australian Conference in the name of the 72 million members of the World Federation of Trade Unions, and expresses enduring mutual assistance and eternal friendship to the working people of Asian countries.
　　This conference is now being held in Beijing. We warmly thank the All-China Federation of Trade Unions for its invitation and friendly hospitality. We can say that we are enjoying a special privilege by gathering in the capital of the People's Democratic China. The Chinese people, not long ago, created a new People's Republic in China, which has given the world's political and social landscape a new look; we are very pleased to be able to directly contact the Chinese people today. We have come from afar, representing the strength of workers from all continents and races, and various social origins; we have witnessed the great enthusiasm that the victory of the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army has created among the people of Europe, Africa, Asia, and the Americas. The victory of the Chinese people in defeating the domestic reactionaries and exploiting classes is regarded by hundreds of millions of people in the world as an obvious defeat for international reactionaries and a great success for human progress.
　　We admire and thank Comrade Mao Zedong, the current Chairman of the People's Republic of China, for leading and accelerating this historic cause of the liberation of the Chinese people; we now once again pay tribute to him in the name of the World Federation of Trade Unions.
　　Beijing can be the venue for the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference today because we know that everything can be freely discussed here. We are confident that our gathering will be respected here, and we can absolutely exercise the trade union rights that are regarded as a glory by true democratic countries.
　　　　×　　　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　　　　×
　　Originally, the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference in Beijing was not a recent initiative decided by the World Federation of Trade Unions. As early as October 1945, the World Federation of Trade Unions Congress had decided to convene an international trade union conference for all Asian countries.
　　The following is the original text of the eighth resolution in the resolution of the Rules Committee of the World Federation of Trade Unions Congress, which was recognized by the plenary session of the Congress and implemented by our Executive Bureau.
　　"The Congress is pleased to believe that Asian countries have made rapid progress in various specialized sciences.
　　"However, the Congress believes that the social conditions of various countries are not yet proportional to the spiritual and material demands of the people, especially the workers.
　　"Therefore, the Congress believes that it is necessary to convene an Asian Trade Union Conference; such a conference can discuss some conditions to meet their demands for workers who have realized that the progress of specialized academics is worthy of respect."
　　Regarding the implementation of the resolution more than four years ago, there are several points to be made. New historical conditions that did not exist in 1945 but exist in 1949 have emerged. The original nature of this conference was aimed at studying the relationship between the degree of economic organization and social technology in the countries present today; but the new historical conditions have made this nature more extensive.
　　Therefore, this conference will not only do abstract work; but also link the actual political and social activities of the workers in Asian and Australian countries with the discussion. First of all, the conference must complete all reporting tasks. It must make the World Federation of Trade Unions fully understand the social, economic, and political aspirations of the workers of various countries. The conference must also point out the results and new prospects that workers have been able to or are currently able to achieve.
　　This conference should also pay attention to the facts. The facts are in China, in the country that is hosting us. We have a new republic here, where trade unions are developing as much as possible; but in India, where we should have organized this conference, anti-worker and anti-trade union oppressive actions have been constantly increasing in the past two years.
　　The fact is that the Soviet delegation representing the Asian part of the Soviet Socialist Republics will contribute their convenience, guarantee, and experience to this conference; while trade unions in other countries unfortunately do not have these.
　　The fact is that the trade unions in North Korea are living and active in a free atmosphere, and they have the means to realize their goals, while the trade unions in South Korea, which are persecuted by the laws of American imperialism and the local neo-fascist reactionaries, do not have these means.
　　The fact is that during this same period, Indonesia, Malaya, and Vietnam have all made progress, which is also worthy of attention.
　　The above are the specific reasons for directly linking the eighth resolution of the Paris World Federation of Trade Unions Congress with the implementation of the fourth resolution of the same congress. The fourth resolution concerns the rights of the people of all countries, and its main points are as follows:
　　"The victory over fascist countries is simultaneously built on the military strength of the United Nations and the active struggle of the people; the purpose of this struggle is to guarantee their basic freedoms, national self-determination, and national independence.
　　"If the people in the colonies and in all territories are denied the full enjoyment of consistent national self-determination and national independence, then this will be a truly incomplete victory.
　　"The recent events in Indochina, in Indonesia, and in the Far East, where some people are still using force to attack the local people, are in direct contradiction with the principles embraced by the United Nations."
　　These two resolutions are fundamental documents; they complement each other and help the Asian-Australian Conference to accomplish its true mission.
　　The new experiences gained in Asian and Australian countries in the past four years prove that the road to social progress can only be traversed when workers fight for national self-determination and independence, and when the working people fight for democratic rights—that is, the right to organize trade unions. The delegates participating in this conference are deeply aware that the World Federation of Trade Unions is working for the benefit of trade unions in Asian and Australian countries. Our international concern and policy of mutual assistance call on us to do everything we have done. However, the Second World Federation of Trade Unions Congress said that our work and our contact with trade unions in Asian and Australian countries were not satisfactory enough. Our shortcomings can be clearly stated. We have found the reasons for it. We have decided to strengthen the work of the World Federation of Trade Unions and its contact with trade unions in Asian countries. Therefore, this Asian-Australian conference can be said to be one of the ways we will be able to improve the way we carry out trade union tasks in your country.
　　What attitude does the World Federation of Trade Unions take towards the various developments in Asian workers' organizations?
　　Comrades, in order to familiarize you with the actions taken by the World Federation of Trade Unions and the policies it promotes, you should at least pay attention to the following ten points:
　　(1) Our delegation from the World Trade Union Organization, in 1946 and 1947, in Iran, Japan, South Korea, and North Korea, completed its mission in developing trade union organizational forces. We have strengthened the connection between the working masses of these countries and the international workers' movement.
　　(2) The World Federation of Trade Unions Council held in Prague in June 1947, in accordance with a major principle of its policy, took steps to support the Chinese trade union movement. At the same time, we opposed all oppressive means of the Kuomintang corrupt elements against the workers, and we supported the efforts of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.
　　After the unified trade union congress held in Harbin in 1948, the Secretariat of the World Federation of Trade Unions decided to use the resolutions of the Harbin Congress to carry out general propaganda to workers in various countries.
　　(3) Since the Indonesian trade union was allowed to join the World Federation of Trade Unions, our organization has taken an internationally open action to oppose the colonial war of Dutch imperialism. Now, Guo Kexar, one of the vice-chairmen of the World Federation of Trade Unions, organized the Indonesian delegation in 1947 and accurately reported to us the true reasons and purposes of the Indonesian people's struggle against the oppressors. Thus, in July 1947, the World Federation of Trade Unions took the lead in launching a serious protest to the United Nations in the name of the international working class, protesting against the agreement between the Dutch government and the Yogyakarta Republic of Indonesian. We have never stopped supporting the people of Indonesia, and we have constantly reminded the United Nations to oppose the oppression of the people and democratic forces in Indonesia. In January 1999, when the Indian government convened the New Delhi Conference, the Executive Bureau submitted a clear notice to the conference, stating its attitude. Here I can introduce its content:
　　"Taking the opportunity of the Delhi Conference, the Executive Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions demands in the name of workers all over the world that you take all effective actions to stop the Dutch aggression against the Indonesian nation. At the same time, it demands the release of Indonesian trade union leaders, Republican Party members and democrats, and the establishment of a democratic system that truly represents the Indonesian people and workers. The Executive Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions declares that national independence is mainly guaranteed by the earnest efforts of each country in industrialization and economic construction. This is the significance of the World Federation of Trade Unions' participation in the Asian and Far East Economic Commission and the United Nations Social and Economic Commission. In the two organizations, the World Federation of Trade Unions enjoys the consultative status of Class A civilian groups. Such effective efforts to guarantee a true national independence require the active cooperation of free trade unions that can truly represent the working class. Workers should fully enjoy the right to exercise trade union rights and actively participate in all decisions of their country's economy and politics."
　　In September 1949, the World Federation of Trade Unions cooperated with the United Trade Union Federation in the Netherlands and sent a letter to the Hague Round Table Conference, proposing the organization of an international trade union investigation sub-committee to investigate the current situation of Indonesian trade unions and the demands of the workers.
　　The Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference should note that as of November 1, 1949, the World Federation of Trade Unions had not received a clear reply from the Round Table Conference to our specific proposal.
　　(4) The war imposed on the Vietnamese people by French colonialists has aroused protests from French workers. At the same time, it has aroused protests from various international trade union movements. In September 1947, the World Federation of Trade Unions sent a delegation to meet with the colonial minister of the French government. At this meeting, the World Federation of Trade Unions requested the colonial ministry to allow the Executive Bureau to send representatives to Vietnam to contact the Vietnamese trade unions, because the Vietnamese trade unions are also direct branches of the World Federation of Trade Unions. We express the same concern and support for all workers in Vietnam. At the same time, we submitted a report on this delegation to the United Nations. The French government allowed William Brett, a representative of the American knotting industry, to go to Vietnam, but refused to allow the General Secretary of the World Federation of Trade Unions, who has French citizenship, and other members of the Executive Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions to go to Vietnam.
　　We can be sure that the Vietnamese delegation attending the conference today will report to you the close relationship between the World Federation of Trade Unions and the Vietnamese trade union organizations.
　　(5) Although in extreme difficulties, the World Federation of Trade Unions has been concerned about the Pan-Malayan Federation of Trade Unions, we can report to the conference that the leaders who attempted to alienate the worker organizations under the manipulation of the British Trades Union Congress have always refused to recognize the Pan-Malayan Federation of Trade Unions, because this organization has made continuous struggles against those British capitalists who squeezed the Malayan plantation workers, miners, and transport workers. After the Malayan government imposed cruel repression on the Malayan workers in 1948 and after the Pan-Malayan Federation of Trade Unions was banned by the police, the World Federation of Trade Unions raised a serious protest. We have always regarded this organization as the only organization representing the Malayan working class.
　　(6) The relationship between the World Federation of Trade Unions and the All-India Trade Union Congress enables our activities to be constantly linked to the activities of all trade unions in India. The Indian trade union movement, due to low wage income and low purchasing power, and due to the low living standards of workers, has received full support from the World Federation of Trade Unions.
　　We must not forget that this is the most basic function of all trade unions. The Indian government has taken repressive actions against the All-India Trade Union Congress, and Comrade Dangi, the vice-chairman of the World Federation of Trade Unions and the chairman of the All-India Trade Union Congress, has been in prison for a year and a half.
　　The World Federation of Trade Unions did not sit idly by when the police investigated the trade union leaders. The Second World Federation of Trade Unions Congress severely condemned this behavior of contempt for trade union rights, and we have again protested to the Indian government, but in its reply in August this year, the Indian government still insisted on its policy of suppressing the workers' movement, but we will continue to defend these policies that respect the sovereignty of trade unions and the interests of workers.
　　(7) The World Federation of Trade Unions has voluntarily and directly submitted reports on the situation of workers in Indonesia, India, Burma, Malaya, South Korea, Chiang Kai-shek's areas of China, and Ceylon to the United Nations Economic and Social Committee. At the same time, the World Federation of Trade Unions has accused these governments of Anglo-American imperialism that oppress the people, and has accused these countries' governments of feudal economic exploitation of the people, which are all in violation of the United Nations Charter.
　　(8) We must report to the conference that the World Federation of Trade Unions has a consultative status in the Asian and Far East Economic Commission, which is a working body of the United Nations. In the past two years, the World Federation of Trade Unions has strived to make the United Nations Committee recognize the economic and political rights of the people of Asian countries. Needless to say, we cannot discuss the future actions of the World Federation of Trade Unions in Asia and Australia in this conference if we do not understand the benefits of the consultative status enjoyed by the World Federation of Trade Unions in the Asian and Far East Economic Commission.
　　(9) The call for the International Peace Day decided at the Second World Federation of Trade Unions has been widely responded to by the people in Asia and Australia. On October 2, the festival for the struggle for peace, we re-established contact with the trade union movement in Burma. October 2 is a day when our position is strengthened in all countries, including your country.
　　(10) Finally, if we pay attention to the representation of Asian countries participating in the leadership of the World Federation of Trade Unions, if we compare the representation that the trade union organizations in this part of the world have constantly gained by participating in our world trade union organizations, the solidarity of the workers in your country represented by the World Federation of Trade Unions is growing stronger in the world workers' camp. Since June 1946, the large organizations that have joined the World Federation of Trade Unions include Vietnam, Malaya, Siam, Indonesia, North Korea, the Philippines, Japan, South Korea, and Mongolia.
　　Comrades, from the above ten important points that have been briefly raised, you can see our relationship, actions, and roles with trade unions in Asian and Australian countries.
　　We can now declare that, as an achievement of past actions and an indication of our future direction, the World Federation of Trade Unions has decided to establish a permanent organization for the World Federation of Trade Unions to liaise with Asian and Far Eastern countries at this international trade union conference in China.
　　Therefore, the most important task of the conference is how to complete the task plan of this organization, and how to lead the workers and trade union movement in the future. In this way, we can learn some lessons from the history of this conference. Because we have convened the conference today, the fact that our conference is being held here today is a good demonstration for the leaders of trade unions in Asian and Australian countries who are under the command of Anglo-American-Dutch imperialism. Their fate is linked to that of their imperialism itself.
　　Capitalist countries are trying to obstruct our conference, they are trying to eliminate the development of all Asian and Far Eastern people's and democratic movements, and they are also trying to find support within the World Federation of Trade Unions. They received the shameless support of British Dickens, American Carey, and Dutch Kobe, members of the Executive Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions in 1947, 1948, and the beginning of 1949, which shows that these people still retain racial prejudices and the idea of oppressing colonies. These principles are opposed by our organization. The World Federation of Trade Unions has had numerous resolutions against political, racial, religious, and national discrimination in international workers' actions; the attitude of the shameless leaders of the British Trades Union Congress, the American Trades Union, and the Dutch Trades Union only shows that they participated in the imperialist actions against the people of colonial, semi-colonial, and economically weak countries.
　　The working people of Asian countries should remember that only the Dutch United Trade Union has adopted an attitude in the Netherlands that is in line with the goals and ideals of the World Trade Union. The World Trade Union was established for these goals and ideals.
　　In 1947 and 1948, the leaders of the British Trades Union Congress and the American Industrial Trade Union Congress actually made it impossible for us to publish the general report of the mission in Japan and Korea. Why? Because our general report listed the existence of neo-fascism in South Korea, the rebirth of Japanese trust capitalists, and the actions of American imperialist capitalist warlords. These are undeniable facts.
　　In 1948, the British Trades Union separatist leaders actually approved the British government's conquest of the Malayan people and the police's dissolution of the Pan-Malayan Labor League.
　　We reviewed the organizational situation of the All-Asia Federation of Trade Unions. In 1947, the sponsors of the Anglo-American trade unions used despicable means to exclude the legitimate labor representatives of certain regions in Asia from the conference.
　　We fully understand that their attempt to divide and weaken the strength of workers in Asia and the Far East failed in the World Federation of Trade Unions, so they combined with the actions of the American Labor Alliance, and the reactionary attitude of the main leaders of this alliance is well known. First in San Francisco in 1948, and then in Geneva in 1949, taking the opportunity of the meeting of the International Labor Bureau, the American Labor Alliance and the separatist leaders of the British Trades Union Congress tried to create an Asian Federation of Trade Unions. European and American newspapers were forced to publish such a ridiculous conspiracy, that is, an indirect conspiracy by the Anglo-American trade union sponsors to eliminate the influence of the World Federation of Trade Unions in Asia and the Far East.
　　Regarding this level, we can say here that if the International Labor Bureau facilitates such tricks against the working people of Asian and Australian countries in the future, it will inevitably be quickly and decisively condemned by the labor organizations of these countries and completely lose its credibility among them.
　　From these events, we can see the importance of today's conference. Because this conference has encountered the opposition and resistance of these people, we can see that this conference plays an important and decisive role in the future development of the trade union movement in Asian and Australian countries, and it also plays an important and decisive role in the struggle of the working people for social progress, economic development, democracy and peace. The difficult history of convening this conference is enough to show that the grand opening of the conference in Beijing yesterday is already a great victory for the international working class under the leadership of the World Federation of Trade Unions.
　　The tasks and responsibilities of this conference are very heavy. These tasks and responsibilities should be listed together with the tasks and responsibilities in our international movement decided at the Second World Trade Union Conference convened in Milan, Italy in July 1949. At the last plenary session of the Milan Conference, a detailed discussion was held on the situation and activities of trade unions in Asian countries, and the Asian conclusions on these situations and activities were combined with similar issues in Latin America and Africa. The working group of the World Trade Union Conference has determined several suggestions. These suggestions should be brought up again at this conference as the direction of the work of the delegations of various countries. The conclusions of the Milan Conference helped us, and we can observe that after World War II, the imperialist exploitation and political and military oppression suffered by colonial countries have intensified, violating the permission of the right to national self-determination made by the colonial powers to the colonial people during and just after World War II.
　　Today, the economic panic in the capitalist world is increasing. In order to solve their difficulties, the ruling class of capitalist countries not only intensifies the exploitation of workers in their own countries, but also carries out economic exploitation of colonial countries, mainly the working people of these countries, and increasingly deep military aggression, in order to increase their interests.
　　This tendency makes the burden of the colonial working people heavier and their lives more miserable. This is clearly reflected in the British government's recent "Four-Year Plan." This plan intends to use a large sum of money to engage in "development" in the colonies. Point 4 of President Truman's speech in 1949 also included the same situation of investment. This statement clearly exposed the United States' increased attention to colonial interests. The attempt of large-scale investment by the United States completely violated the principles of developing economically backward countries at the London Conference of the World Federation of Trade Unions in February 1945 and the Paris Founding Conference of the World Federation of Trade Unions in October 1945. This post-war capitalist conspiracy against colonial countries has brought about the systematic oppression of genuine trade union movements and democratic freedoms, and at the same time brought about various attempts to establish trade unions that are ordered by capitalists and governments and unite them continent by continent as pseudo-federations. We should remind the working people in colonial countries, semi-colonial countries and economically backward countries to be careful of this fact. If everyone lets these plans mature, then political and economic control will be transferred to the hands of the most powerful imperialist power in the world, and political and economic liberation will be more difficult.
　　The struggle for the economic demands of the working people should be regarded as a correct means to promote our general action for liberation, which makes it possible for us to unite a broad mass of people. The political, economic, and feudal remnants of reactionaries are still very strong in some Asian countries! When they talk about national independence, they only have the same opinions in their talks of inhuman exploitation of the masses of the people. But they do not hesitate to seek direct support from imperialism in order to eliminate the high tide of the people's democratic forces.
　　We should recognize this fact: the role of imperialists in Asia and the Far East has suffered a defeat. The imperialists have encountered the hostility of the people of various countries, and this hostility will increase in the coming years.
　　We must complete the termination of feudalism and the colonial system. Because this system is incompatible with the democratic trade union movement in various countries. The great development of trade union organizations in various countries is also an ancillary factor in eliminating the colonial and feudal systems. In every country and every region, the activities of trade unions and the activities of democratic forces cannot be separated. These activities are related to the situation in each country.
　　The Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference also makes a great contribution to strengthening the world peace movement. This conference can help develop the struggle against the agitators of the Third World War. The World Federation of Trade Unions is also a member of the anti-imperialist and world peace defense camp. The world will usher in a new era of justice, peace, and progress, and we should gain our own position in this great tide of change. During this period, the World Federation of Trade Unions cannot be without opinions, neutral, or passive. On the side of the peace camp, the democratic camp, and the anti-imperialist camp, and on the side of imperialism that launches wars and fake democracy, there is no room for a third party.
　　Delegates, your reports will prove that the World Federation of Trade Unions is on the side of the democratic camp and opposes the imperialists.
　　You can prove that in the defense of the world peace front, our trade union movement is an active expression of the organized working class.
　　The Soviet Union is a country that resolutely, justly, and bravely defends peace and friendship between the people of all countries. We should be with their trade unions, and we are also with the trade unions of the European people's democratic countries and the People's Republic of China.
　　We are with the branches of the World Federation of Trade Unions in imperialist countries and colonial and semi-colonial countries.
　　We are with the World Federation of Democratic Youth.
　　We are with the World Federation of Democratic Women.
　　We must unite with the international committee of intellectuals, the progressive people in the world, to make the world's greatest unity, build a new world, live in peace, concretely realize socialism, and lay the foundation for a new civilization for mankind.
　　Long live the development of trade unions in Asian and Australian countries!
　　Long live the trade unions that work to protect the economic and social welfare demands of workers!
　　Long live the mutual assistance and solidarity of the world working class!
　　Long live the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference!
　　Long live the World Federation of Trade Unions!

　　世界工联在亚洲澳洲国家的活动和它的任务
    赛扬在亚澳工会会议上的报告
    【新华社北京十七日电】赛扬在亚澳工会会议上的“世界工联在亚洲澳洲国家的活动和它的任务”的报告全文如下：
    亲爱的同志：
    这一次在这里——北京——举行亚澳工会会议，可以说是一九四五年十月世界工会联合会成立以来最重要最积极的行动之一；所有从亚洲各国来的，不论男女青年，不论来自大城市或者农村，不论是体力劳动或智力劳动者，都热烈地向大会表示敬意。世界工联执行局，受世界工会联合会第二次大会的委托，以世界工联七千二百万会员的名义向亚澳会议致敬，同时对于亚洲各国的劳动人民，表示持久互助的情感和永远不变的友谊。
    这一会议现在是在北京举行了。我们热烈地感谢中华全国总工会的邀请和他友谊的招待。我们在人民民主的中国的首都集会，可以说是享受了一种特别的优待。中国的人民，不久以前，在中国创造了一个新的人民共和国，使世界的政治的和社会的面貌焕然一新；我们今天能够直接同中国人民接触，我们感到非常愉快。我们是从远道而来，我们代表着各洲和各种人种的，各色各样社会根源的工人的力量；中国人民和中国人民解放军的胜利，在欧洲、非洲、亚洲、美洲各国的人民间所造成的广大的热情，是我们亲眼见到了的。中国人民击败国内的反动派、剥削阶级所获得的胜利，世界上万万数的人认为这就是国际反动派的一种显然的失败，是人类进步的一大成功。
    现为中华人民共和国的主席的毛泽东同志，领导了而且加速了这一历史性的中国人民解放事业，我们对他是钦佩而且感谢；我们现在再一次以世界工会联合会的名义向他致敬。
    北京今日之所以能成为亚澳工会会议开会的所在地，是因为我们知道在这里可以自由讨论一切。我们确有把握，在这里我们的集会将被尊重，我们能绝对使用为真正的民主国家视为一种光荣的工会权。
    　　　　×　　　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　　　　×
    本来，北京的亚澳工会会议并不是世界工联最近才决定的一个创举。远在一九四五年十月，世界工联大会已决定要召开一个亚洲所有国家的国际职工会议。
    以下便是世界工联代表大会规程委员会所作的议决案中第八决议案的原文，这一决议案是大会的全体会议所承认而交由我们执行局所实行的。
    “大会愉快地认为亚洲各国，在各种专门科学上，已有迅速的进步。
    “但大会认为各国的社会条件，与人民的特别是工人的精神的物质的要求还不能成为正比。
    “因此，大会认为有召开一个亚洲职工会议的必要；此种会议，对于已觉到专门学术之进步值得尊重的工人，是可以研讨出一些条件满足他们的要求的。”
    关于执行四年多以前的决议的情形，有几点可说。一九四五年并不存在而一九四九年才有的新的历史条件出现了。这会议本来的性质是旨在研究关于今天出席各国的经济组织程度和社会技术的关系；但新的历史条件，却使得这一性质是更加广泛了。
    所以，这会议不仅作抽象的工作；而且要把亚澳各国工人在实际政治上和社会上活动的情形与讨论联结起来，首先会议得完成一切报导的任务。他得使世界工联完全了解各国男女工人对于社会、经济、政治上的愿望。凡是工人们已经有能力或现有能力这样作的，会议对于他们所获得的结果和新的远景也得指的出。
    这一次会议也应注意到各项事实。事实是在中国，在招待我们的国家里。我们有一个新的共和国，这里的工会是正在尽量地发展；但在印度，本来我们应当在这里组织这一会议的，反工人反工会的压迫举动，在最近两年来，却不断地日益加多。
    事实要代表亚洲部分各苏维埃社会主义共和国的苏联代表团，把他们的便利，保证和经验贡献给这一会议；而其他国家里的职工会不幸地还没有的。
    事实是北朝鲜的工会已在自由的空气中生活着和活动着，他们有实现的方法，而南韩的工会，受着美帝国主义和当地新法西斯反动派的法律的迫害的工会，就没有这些方法了。
    事实是，在这一同一时期，印尼、马来亚、越南都各有了进步，这也是值得注意的。
    以上就是使巴黎世界工联大会第八决议案直接地与和该会第四决议案联合起来执行的具体原因。第四决议案是有关各国人民的权利的，其要点如下：
    “对法西斯各国所获得的胜利，是同时建筑在联合国的军事力量和人民所进行的积极斗争上的；这斗争的目的是旨在他们的基本自由，民族自决权与民族独立等获得保证。
    “如果否认了殖民地的和各国领土内的人民完全享受一贯的民族自决和民族独立的权利，那么，这将是真正的不完全的胜利。
    “最近在印度支那，在印尼，在远东发生的事件，那里有人还采用武力来打击当地人民，这和联合国所抱的原则是直接矛盾的。”
    这两决议案是基本的文件；它们相辅相成，帮助亚澳会议，完成其真正的任务。
    四年来在亚澳各国所得到的新的经验，证明社会进步的道路，只能在工人为民族自决与独立的斗争、劳动人民为取得民主权利——即组织工会权利——的斗争下，才能走得通。参与这一次会议的代表们，是深深知道世界工联是为亚澳各国工会的利益而努力的。我们的国际关怀和互助的政策，叫我们要作我们所作过的一切。可是第二次世界工联代表大会曾说过，我们的工作和对亚澳各国工会的联络方面，作得不够十分满意。我们的缺点是可以明白说出来的。我们曾找出他的原因。我们已决定加强世界工联的工作和对亚洲各国工会的联络。所以这一次的亚澳会议，可以说是一种我们将得以改善我们在你们的国内执行工会任务的方法之一。
    关于亚洲工人组织的活动有各色各样的发展，世界工联抱着什么样的态度呢？
    同志们，为了使你们熟悉世界工联所采取的行动和它所推行的政策，你们至少该注意下列的十点：
    （一）我们世界职工会组织的代表团，一九四六及一九四七年，在伊朗、日本、南朝鲜、北朝鲜，已使在工会组织力量的发展方面，完成它的任务。我们已加强这些国家的工人群众和国际工人运动的联系。
    （二）一九四七年六月布拉格举行的世界工联理事会，根据它的政策的一个主要原则，采取了拥护中国的工会运动的步骤。同时反对国民党腐化分子对工人的一切压迫手段，我们拥护了中国人民解放军事业的努力。
    在一九四八年哈尔宾召开的统一的工会代表大会以后，世界工联秘书处，就决议把哈尔滨大会的决议案，用来向各国工人作普遍的宣传。
    （三）自从印尼的工会被允许参加了世界工联以后，我们的组织就采取了一个国际上公开的行动，反对荷兰帝国主义的殖民地的战争。现在世界工联的副主席之一郭罗克萨尔，在一九四七年，组织了印尼的代表团，曾向我们精确地报告印尼人民对压迫者进行斗争的真正的原因和目的。于是一九四七年七月世界工联就以国际工人阶级名义首先发动向联合国提出严重抗议，抗议荷兰政府和印尼共和国日惹缔结的协定。我们不曾停止过支持印尼的人民，我们不断地提起联合国注意，反对在印尼进行着对人民、对民主力量的压迫。一九四九年一月，印度政府召开新德里会议的时候，执行局向这个会议提出一个明白的通告，表明了态度。这里我可以把它的内容介绍一下：
    “趁德里会议的机会，世界工联执行局以全世界工人的名义要求你们采取一切有效的行动制止荷兰对印尼民族的侵略。同时要求释放印尼的工会领袖，共和党员和民主人士，建立真正代表印尼人民和工人的民主制度。世界工联执行局声明民族的独立，是主要地能以每一国家的工业化及经济建设上认真的努力获得保证的。这就是世界工联参加亚洲及远东经济委员会和联合国社会经济委员会的意义。在两机构中、世界工联享有甲类民众团体的咨询地位。这样有效地保障一个真正的民族独立的努力是需要真正能代表工人阶级的、自由的工会积极合作的。工人们应当完全享有运用工会权利，积极参加他们国家经济的、政治的一切决定方针。”
    一九四九年九月世界工联同荷兰国内统一工会总会合作，致函海牙圆桌会议，提议组织一国际工会调查小组委员会，去调查目前印尼工会的情况和工人们的要求。
    亚澳工会会议应当注意到，在一九四九年十一月一日，世界工联还没有收到该圆桌会议对我们的明确的提议的答复。
    （四）法国殖民地主义者加于越南人民的战争，已引起法国工人的抗议。同时也引起国际各工会运动的抗议。一九四七年九月，世界工联曾派了一个代表团去谒见法政府的殖民部长。这一次的会议中世界工联曾要求殖民部准许执行局派代表到越南去同越南工会发生联系，因为越南工会也是世界工联的直属分会。我们对于越南所有工人同样地表示关切和支援，同时，我们向联合国提出有关这个代表团的报告。法国政府曾准许美国结毛线业的代表威廉布列特去越南，但是拒绝一个具有法国公民资格的全世界工会联合会的总书记，和其他世界工联执行局的委员去越南。
    我们可以肯定今日出席大会的越南代表团将会向诸位报告有关世界工联和越南工会组织的密切关系。
    （五）虽然在极端困难中，世界工联曾关切全马来总工会，我们可以向大会报告，在英国职工大会操纵下的企图离间工人组织的领袖们，始终不愿承认全马来总工会，因为这个组织向那些榨取马来亚垦殖工人、矿工、以及运输工人的英国资本家作不断的斗争。一九四八年马来政府对于马来工人施用残酷的镇压之后及全马来总工会遭受警察禁止之后，世界工联曾提出严重抗议。我们始终把这一个组织看作是唯一代表马来工人阶级的组织。
    （六）世界工联与全印总工会的关系，使我们的活动和印度所有的工会的活动经常联系起来。印度工会运动由于工资收入之少与购买力之低，由于工人生活水准之低，获得世界工联全力的支持。
    我们不要忘了这是所有工会最起码的作用。印度政府曾施镇压行动，对付全印职工大会，世界工联的副主席全印职工大会的主席丹吉同志已经关在狱中一年半之久了。
    警察侦察各工会领袖，对于这些事情，世界工联并未坐视不理。第二次世界工联大会曾严厉地谴责了这种蔑视工会权利的行为，我们曾又向印度政府提抗议，但在今年八月印政府的回答中，依然坚持他们镇压工人运动的政策，但我们依然继续保卫这些尊重工会的主权以及工人利益的政策。
    （七）世界工联曾自动地直接向联合国经济社会委员会提出关于印尼、印度、缅甸、马来、南朝鲜、中国的蒋管区，以及锡兰工人情况的报告，同时世界工联对这些英美帝国主义压迫人民的政府进行控诉，向这些国家的政府对人民的封建式的经济榨取进行控诉，这些行为都是违背联合国宪章的。
    （八）我们得向大会报告，世界工联在亚洲及远东经济委员会，它是联合国的一个工作机构，有咨询地位。在最近二年中，世界工联曾尽力使联合国的委员会承认亚洲各国人民的经济与政治的权利。不消说我们在这次大会中无法讨论世界工联在亚澳两洲的未来行动，假如我们不去了解世界工联在亚洲及远东经济委员会中所享受的咨询地位的利益。
    （九）在第二次世界工联中所决定的国际和平日的号召，在亚澳两洲都获得人民广泛的响应。在十月二日的为和平斗争的节日，我们和缅甸的工会运动重新取得联系。十月二日这一天是我们的地位在所有国家包括你们国家在内加强的一天。
    （十）最后，我们如果注意参加世界工联领导的亚洲各国的代表性，如果我们比较一下世界这一部分职工组织不断参加我们世界性的职工组织而获得的代表性，世界工联所代表着的你们国内的工人们的团结力量正在世界工人阵营中壮大，一九四六年六月起，加入世界工联的大组织的有越南、马来、暹罗、印尼、北朝鲜、菲律宾、日本、南朝鲜及蒙古。
    同志们，从以上很简单地提出来的重要的十点，可以看出我们和亚澳各国工会的关系、行动与作用。
    我们现在可以声明，作为过去的行动的成就和我们未来方向的指示，世界工联决定在此次国际性职工会议上，在中国成立一个世界工联与亚洲及远东各国联络的经常组织。
    因此大会要完成的最首要的工作，就是如何完成这个组织的任务计划，以及如何领导今后工人及工会运动。如此，我们可以从这次会议的历史上获得一些教训。因为我们今天所召开的大会有一段历史，那就是我们今日大会在此地召开，对于那些受英美荷帝国主义指挥下的分离工会的亚澳各国职工会的领袖是一个很好的示威。他们的命运是与他们帝国主义的本身联在一起的。
    资本主义国家企图阻挠我们的大会召开，他们企图消灭一切亚洲及远东人民及民主的运动的发展，他们还企图在世界工联之内找寻支援。他们得到了一九四七、一九四八以及一九四九年之初世界工联执行局的委员英国狄更，美国加莱，荷兰顾贝的无耻的支持，这说明了这些人还保留着种族之见和压迫殖民地的念头。这些原则是为我们组织所反对的，世界工联有过无数的决议案反对国际工人行动的政治、种族、宗教和国家的歧见；英国职工大会、美国职工会，和荷兰职工会的无耻的领袖们的态度，只表示他们参加了反殖民地反半殖民地和经济力薄弱的各国人民的帝国主义行动。
    亚洲各国的劳动人民应该记得，只有荷兰统一职工会在荷兰采取了符合世界职工会的目标及理想的态度。世界职工会就为这些目标及理想而建立的。
    在一九四七及一九四八年，英国职工大会和美国产业职工大会的领袖们在实际上使我们无法刊行在日本及朝鲜所负使命的总报告。为什么呢？因为我们的总报告上面列举了关于南朝鲜新法西斯的存在，日本托拉斯资本家的再生，美国帝国主义的资本主义军阀主义的行动。这都是不可否认的事实。
    一九四八年英国职工会分离分子领袖们实际上赞同了英国政府对于马来人民的征讨，及以警察力量解散泛马来亚劳工联盟。
    我们检讨全亚洲总工会的组织情况，在一九四七年，英美工会的主持者竟用了卑劣的手段，意在摒除亚洲某些地区的合法劳工代表于这次会议之外。
    我们完全明了，他们分化和减弱亚洲及远东工人力量的企图在世界工联中失败了，他们就和美国的劳工联盟的行动结合起来，这联盟的主要领袖的反动态度是众所周知的。首先是一九四八年在旧金山，其次于一九四九年在日内瓦，借国际劳工局开会之便，美国劳工联盟和英国职工大会分离领袖们曾试探创建一个亚洲职工总会。欧美的报纸竟被迫而刊登了这样的滑稽阴谋，即英美工会主持人为了取消世界工联在亚洲及远东的影响的一个间接的阴谋。
    关于这一层，我们在这里可以说，国际劳工局如果将来予这样反对亚澳各国的劳动人民的把戏以便利的话，必定迅速地而且决定地遭受这些国家劳工组织的谴责，在他们中间完全失去信用。
    从这些事件看来就可以知道今天大会的重要性。因为这个会议遭遇到这些人的反对和抵抗，就可以知道这个会议对于未来的亚澳国家工会运动发展上起着重要的决定性作用，也对于劳动人民为社会进步，为经济发展民主和和平而斗争起着一个重要决定性的作用。召集这次会议的困难的历史足以说明，大会昨日隆重地在北京开幕，已经是国际工人阶级在世界工联领导下的伟大胜利了。
    这次会议的任务及责任是很重大的。这些任务和责任应该与我们于一九四九年七月在意大利米兰召集的第二次世界职工会大会所决定的我们国际运动中的任务和责任列入一起的。在上次米兰大会全体会议上，曾对于亚洲各国工会的情形及活动作过详细的讨论，把关于这些情况及活动的亚洲结论与拉丁美洲和非洲类似的问题结在一起。世界职工会大会的小组曾确定若干建议。这些建议应该在这次会议上重新提起以作为各国代表团的工作的方向。米兰大会的结论帮助了我们，我们可以观察到，第二次世界大战后，殖民地国家所受到的帝国主义的榨取，政治的军事的压迫日益加甚，违反了在第二次大战中及大战刚结束后殖民地列强向殖民地人民所作的民族自决的权利的允许。
    今日资本主义世界的经济恐慌日益加甚，资本主义国家的统治阶级为了解决他们的困难，不但加紧对于本国工人的榨取，而且还进行对于殖民地主要对于这些国家的劳动人民的经济榨取，及日益加深的军事上的侵略，以增加他们的利益。
    这种倾向使得殖民地劳动人民的负担更加重了，他们的生活更加凄惨了。这在英国政府最近的“四年计划”中很显明表现出来了。这计划拟以一笔大款子从事殖民地的“发展”。一九四九年杜鲁门总统的演说中的第四点也包含了同样情形的投资。这一篇声明很明显地暴露了美国对于殖民地利益注意力的加强，美帝大规模投资的企图，完全违反了一九四五年二月的世界工联伦敦会议，一九四五年十月世界工联巴黎成立大会的发展经济落后国家的原则。这种战后资本主义对于殖民地国家的阴谋，带来了那些对于直正职工会运动和民主自由的有步骤的压迫，同时带来建立受命于资本家与政府的职工会并一洲一洲联合起来作为伪联合会的种种企图。我们应该提醒殖民地国家、半殖民地国家和经济落后的国家内的劳动人民当心这事实，如果大家让这些计划成熟的话，那么政治上的和经济上的控制权将能移到世界上帝国主义列强中最强大的一国的手中了，而政治的，经济的解放将更为困难了。
    劳动人民的经济要求的斗争应该认为推进我们解放总行动中一个使我们可能团结广泛群众的正确手段。反动分子政治的经济的封建残余在若干亚洲各国还是很坚强的！当他们说什么民族独立，他们只在对人民大众的非人的剥削的谈话中才有同一样的意见。但是他们不迟疑于寻找帝国主义的直接支援，为的是消灭人民的民主力量的高潮到来。
    我们应该认识这一个事实：帝国主义者的作用在亚洲及远东已遭受了失败了。帝国主义者遭遇了各国人民的敌对，这种敌对在未来的年月内将更加增涨了。
    我们一定要完成终结封建主义和殖民地制度。因为这种制度，是和各国的民主工会运动不相容的。各国职工组织的大大的发展也是一种使殖民地和封建制度消灭的一种附带的因素。在每一国家每一区内工会的活动和民主力量的活动是不能够分开的。这些活动，对于每一国的情势都是有关系的。
    亚澳工会会议对于加强世界的和平运动也有极大的贡献。这会议可帮助反对第三次世界大战扇动者的斗争发展。世界工联也是反对帝国主义及世界保卫和平阵营中的一分子。世界将展开一个正义的、和平的、进步的新纪元，我们应当在这一大转变的潮流中，获得自己的地位。世界工联在这期间，不能毫无主见不能中立，也不能被动。在和平阵营、民主阵营，反帝国主义这一面，和发动战争与假民主的帝国主义的一面，不容有第三者的地位存在。
    诸位代表们，你们都要在这里展开你们的报告，这一切可以证明世界工联是站在民主阵营的一面，反对着帝国主义者的。
    你们可以证明，在保卫世界和平阵线中，我们的工会运动是有组织的工人阶级的一种积极的表现。
    苏联是以坚决、正义和勇敢保卫和平与各国人民间的友谊的国家，我们应和他们的工会在一道，我们也和欧洲各人民民主国家和中华人民共和国的工会在一道。
    我们同帝国主义的国家，殖民地半殖民地的世界工联的支会工会在一起。
    和世界民主青联在一道。
    和世界民主妇联在一道。
    我们要和国际间知识分子的委员会，世界上的进步分子，作世界上伟大的团结，建设一个新世界，生活于和平之中，使社会主义具体地实现，奠定人类的新的文明的基础。
    亚澳各国工会的发展万岁！
    为了保障工人经济的、社会福利的要求而活动的工会万岁！
    世界工人阶级互助团结万岁！
    亚澳工会会议万岁！
    世界工联万岁！
