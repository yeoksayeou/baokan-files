Comrade, You Are Wrong!
    ——A Letter to a Classmate Returning Home
    Lu Wei
    Comrade: You are our classmate, I remember very clearly, in those days, at group meetings, you spoke the most, usually you shouted slogans the loudest, and you were never absent from any activity; you received the praise of most people, "advanced element," "active youth!" Which classmate doesn't have that impression etched in their mind?
    I remember it was a June evening, a gentle breeze, and six of us were strolling on the meadow. You, with an advanced posture and resolute tone, said these words:
    "For future work, I will absolutely obey the organization's assignment! Regardless of city or countryside, south or north, wherever the people need me, I will go. Serving the people is non-negotiable. Any emphasis on one's own interests or abilities is individualism, a manifestation of selfishness..."
    But today, who is not obeying the organization's assignment? Who is asking to stay in the city and not go to the countryside? Who is emphasizing personal interests and abilities? It is you, precisely you who said those words before!
    "Working in education" was your own application! "Obey the organization's assignment! Regardless of city or countryside," was the will you expressed. Today, in accordance with your wish and guarantee, you are assigned to be a primary school teacher, but in the actual test, you slapped yourself in the face.
    You went home: You actually refused everything, is this the harvest of your six months of study?
    Why do you despise primary school teachers? We are basic-level cadres building the new China, we are sentinels fighting against cultural backwardness, this arduous and great task is precisely our boundless glory. You despise this position, which proves that you still harbor the old society's upward-climbing mentality, selfish individualism. This is not the ideology that a revolutionary youth should have.
    Going home, this is you declaring that you are unwilling to serve the people!
    Today, those who are unwilling to serve the people, like dew that cannot resist the sun, can only quickly destroy themselves. Cutting oneself off from the people is such a foolish thing. I hope you wake up quickly, conduct a thorough self-criticism, eliminate all backward thinking, and quickly return to the embrace of the people! Comrades can forgive your mistake this time, and will help you correct it.

    同志：你错了！
    ——写给一个回家的同学
    鲁炜
    同志：你是我们同班中的伙伴，我记得很清楚，在那些日子里，小组会上，你话说得最多，平时你口号喊得最响，什么活动都少不了你；你得到大多数人的称赞，“先进分子，”“积极的青年！”那一个同学脑子中不印烙着这个印象呢？
    记得是六月的黄昏，微风轻掠，我们六个人散步在草场上，你以先进的姿态，坚决的口吻，说出了这些话：
    “未来的工作，我绝对听候组织分配！不管城市、乡村、南方、北方，人民需要我到那里，我就到那里。为人民服务，是不能讲价钱的。任何强调自己的兴趣、能力，都是个人主义，自私自利的化形……”
    但是，今天，谁不服从组织分配？谁要求在城市而不去乡村？谁强调了个人兴趣和能力？这是你，正是先前说那些话的你！
    “干教育工作”是你自己报的！“服从组织分配！不管城市乡村，”是你表示的意志。今天依顺着你的志愿与保证来分配你做小学教师，你却在实际考验中自己打了自己的嘴巴。
    你回家了：你竟然拒绝了一切，这就是你学习六个月的收获吗？
    你为什么轻视小学教员？我们是建设新中国的基层干部，我们是和文化落后作斗争的哨兵，这艰巨伟大的任务，正是我们无限的光荣，你轻视这职位，这证明你还存有旧社会留给的往上爬的思想，自私自利的个人主义，这不是革命青年应有的思想意识。
    回家，这就是你宣布了不愿为人民服务！
    今天不愿为人民服务的人，就象露水不能抗拒阳光一样，只有迅速的毁灭自己。自绝于人民，这是多愚笨的事体，我希望你赶快醒悟。痛切检讨，消灭一切落后思想，赶快回到人民的怀抱里来！同志们是能原谅你这一次的错误，而且会帮助你改正错误。
