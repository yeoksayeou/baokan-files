Xi Lu, beaming, walked down from the stage. Shuan Cheng led the crowd in another round of loud discussion. They felt that Xi Lu's grain and clothing should be returned to him as much as possible, and the mine should be discussed properly, not carelessly. Only then did they officially adjourn the meeting.

After the meeting, the members of the Workers' and Peasants' Association were busy checking Ju Bao's wealth. Because the struggle against Chun Qi was done by Qian Danao and Yu Bao, not much was seized from him. This time, Qian Danao confessed more, and the families of Bian Xiao and Bai Quan were also found to have hidden more. As a result, they were found to have two kilns of grain, ten boxes of clothing, eight hundred silver dollars, and some scattered furniture, copper coins, and small change. Added to what was seized from a few other families, the floating wealth was considerable. The Workers' and Peasants' Committee then registered and sorted out the fruits of the struggle day and night, and converted the clothing and furniture into grain prices, preparing to divide the village into grades according to their living conditions: the village was busy and lively again.

Thirty-Six: Talking About the Mine

Speaking of these times, people were having small meetings and large meetings one after another, and no one was really focused on production. Life was really difficult, and some families couldn't find even a grain of rice or a spoonful of flour. Fortunately, everyone's energy was high, and they managed to cope with each other. However, when the struggle meeting was held and the floating wealth was collected, people couldn't hold back! Listen: they were clamoring for production! Looking for a way to make a living! The whole village was clamoring.

But what could they do to make it happen! Everyone in the village was looking at the rooms full of floating wealth, clamoring to quickly distribute the grain and then talk about other things. Xiao Yanggui also heard such opinions in his ears and told the committee and Lao Yin every day. Lao Yin also agreed to distribute the grain quickly, but he felt that while not hindering the work, they should quickly find a way to organize production so that they could sustain the people in the long run. Shuan Cheng and Bian Xiao also agreed with this, and everyone discussed and agreed. The village then began to assess the grades of each household according to the standard households to prepare for grain distribution, while planning for production.

At this time, the situation in Yangquan was much better. In the past six months, the enemy had occupied Huolu and Shouyang, and Yan Xishan's reactionary troops would inevitably come out to make trouble, which affected the morale of the masses to some extent. The leadership didn't pay close enough attention at that time, so the production of factories and mines didn't improve much. Now, as soon as Shijiazhuang was liberated, the military situation quickly stabilized, and the morale of the masses on the Zhengtai Railway was even more stable. This area was surrounded by old liberated areas, and the masses were encouraged by the new scenes of the workers and peasants in the old areas. Everyone's enthusiasm for land and for restoring production was greatly increased. At the same time, the leadership was also determined to carry out a good land reform here and vigorously restore the production of factories and mines. Therefore, the Yangquan Iron Factory quickly started up and resumed operation, and the villages around it that were running iron furnaces and opening coal mines were increasing day by day. The enthusiasm of Black Rock Slope Village for opening mines was also growing louder and louder every day. Lao Yin and the village cadres' production plan also included opening coal mines from the beginning. Therefore, they began to make preparations separately.

Lao Yin and the cadres toured all the good and bad coal mines in Black Rock Slope Village and organized the masses to discuss them once. Combining everyone's opinions on opening mines and developing production, in addition to some sporadic problems that needed to be solved in the small soil kilns that were already in operation, regarding opening new kilns, most people advocated still using the village's original large kilns. Some said they wanted to expand the west kiln of the large kiln, and some hoped to pump out the water from the east kiln and connect it to the west kiln through a ventilation shaft, and simply spend some effort to make it a good kiln. But there were also others who opposed this opinion. They said that the large kiln had been tried several times in the past but had not been successful, and they were afraid it was not safe. Moreover, in the past, opening the large kiln offended the Old Lord, and the village almost had a major disaster. Now they had to be more stable. However, there were not many people who had this opinion, and they were mostly the Taicheng and his gang who were currently digging the west kiln of the large kiln. Lao Yin listened to these opinions, tilted his neck, and thought for a long time. He felt that there were really too many black coal mines in the village that were not making a living, and it would not be enough to just tidy up the small kilns. As for opening new kilns, he was afraid that it would not be as easy as restoring the original large kiln! The Old Lord and the like were just superstition. As for being afraid of being unsafe? It was not certain that opening a new kiln would be safe either! Lao Yin also agreed in his heart to tidy up the original large kiln. At this time, his understanding of the large kiln and the opinions of the masses' discussion and handling were almost clear, so he quickly started to solve the problem of the large kiln, thinking of starting construction as soon as possible.

According to various materials, it had been determined that the large kiln was seized by the traitorous bully landlord Zhang Ju Bao from Zhang Xi Lu, so it could not be confiscated as Ju Bao's property. However, the opinions of the poor peasant group and the Workers' and Peasants' Association were also very reasonable. They said: After Ju Bao seized the kiln, he did spend money and labor to tidy it up for almost a winter, propped up some support wood in the west kiln, and opened up a few more branch tunnels. Therefore, the kiln could not all be returned to Xi Lu, and Ju Bao's part inside should be confiscated. Lao Yin agreed with this opinion very much, and the Hua Da leadership also approved it. The village then studied and discussed the situation at the bottom of the kiln for a while, and finally determined: 80% of the large kiln belonged to Xi Lu and should all be returned to him; the remaining 20% belonged to Ju Bao and should be confiscated and returned to the whole village. The problem was solved in this way, and no one in the whole village had any objections.

Xi Lu himself did not agree with this. He refused to accept the kiln no matter what, and said to Lao Yin: "If I take this kiln, won't I have to abandon it? I also know the public policy: I can get a loan to help me develop production. But even with a loan, I don't have the ability. My good Lao Yin! I'm old and foolish! My son is not good for anything! If you ask me to open a shop or something, then I dare to do it! This is a kiln! I can't grasp the situation of the kiln, I dare not! In the past, it was because of this problem that the kiln was ruined. No way! Lao Yin, I'm telling you the truth! It's better for everyone to do it! As long as everyone does it successfully and production is developed, I will benefit from it anyway?" Lao Yin still mobilized him, saying that the public and the masses could help him and must get him to accept it, but he still refused! Lao Yin was embarrassed! He fluttered his eyelids and thought for a while, feeling that Xi Lu's difficulties were also true, but he still insisted on the original decision, only saying: "Xi Lu! In any case, the matter of production must be done by everyone finding a way! But this kiln was originally yours! To put it jokingly, can you force us to violate the Communist Party's policy and the masses' decision and give the kiln to the public?" Xi Lu did not speak, and it seemed that he was a little moved. The village cadres persuaded him on the side, and he reluctantly said: "Hey, there's nothing I can do! You see... but everyone must agree! I can't do anything about production! Everyone leads and plans!" Finally, he proposed a condition, saying that he didn't want any of the income from selling coal from the west kiln that was currently in operation this winter: "That was made by Taicheng and the others who spent white labor pumping water, I can't repay them for the supplies for pumping water and tidying up!" Lao Yin said: "Let's discuss this later!" So he settled the village cadres and Xi Lu on one side, asking them to organize the masses to discuss specific ways to open the kiln, and on the other side, he went to Pingtanmao Hua Da headquarters to report.

　　黑石坡煤窑演义（３９）
    康濯
    喜禄喜眉笑眼地走下了戏楼，拴成又领着大伙咯嚷了一阵，觉得喜禄的粮食衣裳还是得尽量想法退，窑也还是得好好讨论，不能稀里马虎；这才正式散了会。
    会后，工农会的委员们又忙着检查聚宝的财帛。春起斗争因为是乾大脑和玉宝做的手脚，所以闹他的东西不多，这回乾大脑又坦白了些，扁小和白泉家也摸清了些，因此又闹出他两窑粮食十箱衣裳八百块现洋，还有些零碎家具铜元制钱等等；再加上别几家的，浮财可也不算少。工农委员会紧接着就日夜登记清理果实，并把衣裳家具折合成米价，准备浑村大伙比光景划等级分配：村里又忙得个烘火热闹。
    三十六　说窑
    却说这些时人们小会大会连着叠着开，生产的事谁也没怎么闹，生活实在困难，有些人家真是一粒米一勺面也寻不见；好在大伙劲头正足，彼此对对付付地也就凑合过去了。不过，赶到斗争会一开，浮财一拾掇，人们可就别不住了！听吧：闹生产呀！找生活呀！一村子嚷了个遍。
    可想什么法闹啊！村里谁也是看着那一屋子一屋的浮财，咯嚷着要赶快分粮食，分了再说别的：小洋鬼更是听了满耳朵这样的意见，天天给委员会和老尹说。老尹倒也赞成快分粮食，但他觉得还是要在不妨碍工作下边，赶紧想法组织生产，才能细水长流养住人；拴成扁小也很赞成这，大伙也讨论同意了，村里就一边找标准户评议各户的等级准备分粮，一边计划起生产了。
    这时候，阳泉的形势好多了。过去半年多，敌人占领了获鹿寿阳，阎锡山的反动队伍短不了出来捣乱，群众情绪受些影响；领导上当时也抓得不太紧，工矿生产也就没有更好闹起来。现在，石家庄刚一解放，军事形势马上稳定下来，正太路上群众的情绪也更稳定了；这里周围又尽是老解放区，群众被老区工人农民的新的光景鼓励着，大家要求土地和要求恢复生产的劲头更大大提高；同时，领导上也正下了决心：要在这里进行好好土地改革，并大力恢复工矿生产。因此，阳泉铁厂很快就拾掇着大开工，左近各村闹铁炉的开煤窑的也一天比一天多，黑石坡村想要开窑的劲头，也咯嚷得一天比一天响；老尹和村干部们闹生产的计划，一开头便也想算到开煤窑了。于是，他们分头作开了准备工作。
    老尹和干部们把黑石坡村的好坏煤窑都转了一遍，并组织群众讨论了一次。归并起大家对开窑闹生产的意见，除了正在动弹的小土窑有些零星问题要解决以外，关于开新窑，多数的人主张还是就村里原有的大窑闹；这里有的说要扩大大窑的西窑，有的还希望把东窑的水也打干净，跟西窑透过风筒，干脆花点力气，闹成个好窑。但另外也有反对这个意见的，他们说大窑过去闹了好几回都没闹好，怕不保险，而且过去大三开窑得罪了老君爷，村里差点没闹出大事情来，现在可得要稳实些才行；不过有这意见的人不多，他们大都是现在在刨大窑那西窑的泰成们一伙子。老尹听了这些意见，仰着脖子思想了半天，觉得村里没营生的窑黑实在多，光拾掇小窑还就是不顶事；开新窑嘛，怕总没有恢复原来的大窑省事吧！那老君爷什么的，不过是迷信；怕不保险么？还不开新窑也不定就保险呀！老尹心里头也同意拾掇原有的大窑了。这时他对那大窑情况的了解和群众讨论处理的意见，都闹得差不多了，于是他赶紧动手解决大窑的事，想着快解决了好快些动工。
    根据各种材料，大窑已经确定了是汉奸恶霸地主张聚宝霸占了张喜禄的，因此不能当作聚宝的财产没收。不过，贫农组和工农会讨论的意见也满有道理，他们说：聚宝霸占了窑以后，的确也花钱花工拾掇了差不多一冬天，把西窑支了些顶木，并多刨开了几条岔道；因此，窑也不能全都退给喜禄，里边聚宝的部份还应该没收。这意见老尹很同意，华大领导上也批准了，村里又根据窑底的情形研究评议了一阵，最后确定：大窑的八成是喜禄的，全部退给他；其余二成是聚宝的，应该没收归全村：问题就是这样解决，浑村上下都没意见了。
    喜禄自己却不同意这么办。他怎么也不肯接受这窑，也对老尹说：“咱拿了这窑还不是得撂了？咱也知道公家的政策：能贷款帮咱闹生产；可贷了款吧，咱也没那份能耐。我的个好老尹哩！我老球啦！咱小子吧甚也不顶！你要叫我开个买卖什么的，那咱还敢干！这是窑哩！咱对窑拿不住个谱谱，咱不敢！过去也就是咱这个毛病，这窑才毁了的。不行！老尹，咱这可是实心话！还是大伙闹吧！只要大伙闹成了，生产开展了，我不一样沾光？”老尹还是动员他，说公家和群众可以帮助他，一定叫他接受，他却还是不！老尹作难了！他扑展着眼皮想算了一阵，觉得喜禄的困难也是实情，但他还是坚持原来的决定，只说：“喜禄！生产的事反正一定是大伙想办法来闹！可这窑原本就是你的嘛！说句耍笑话吧，你还能硬强迫咱们违反共产党的政策和群众的决定，把窑归了公么？”喜禄不言声，看模样，是活动些了；村干部又在一边好说赖说，他才勉强说道：“嗨，这可没办法！你看……可大伙说准定！生产上头咱是闹不起来！大伙领导计划吧！”最后，他又提出一条，说那正动弹的西窑，卖炭收入他这一冬天可一个也不要：“那是人家泰成他们花白工打水才闹成的，咱可没法还人家打水拾掇的供应！”老尹道：“这等以后大伙讨论了再说吧！”于是他一边安顿村干部和喜禄，叫组织群众讨论具体开窑的办法，一边自己去平潭垴华大队部汇报去了。
