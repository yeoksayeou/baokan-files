　　周外长否认蒋廷黻代表团的声明
　　联合国作为正式文件发表
    【新华社北京二十四日电】波兰通讯社纽约讯：按照波兰驻联合国代表团团长维尔布洛夫斯基在致赖伊的信件中所提出的请求，联合国秘书处已于二十二日把中华人民共和国外交部部长周恩来致联合国大会主席罗慕洛及联合国秘书长赖伊的电文，作为正式文件发表。
    【新华社北京二十四日电】波兰通讯社华沙二十三日讯：“华沙”报评论波兰出席联合国大会代表团团长维尔布洛夫斯基对于中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部部长周恩来致电罗慕洛及赖伊一事所采取的步骤称：国民党已永远失去代表中国人民发言的任何权利。波兰要求把中国的电文散发给所有会员国，这是人民民主国家在联合国所采取的第一个声援人民中国的步骤。由于波兰的动议，联合国大会将能审议这个关于把全权自国民党代表团正式移交予真正代表中国人民的代表团的重要问题。
