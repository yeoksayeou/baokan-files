　　Self-Criticism
    Zhu Guangqian

　　The great movement of the Chinese People's Revolution has transformed the entire world, and it has also transformed me personally. My personal transformation is but a small wave in the ocean waves, so insignificant as to be unworthy of attention, but it is also driven by the great tide and not accidental.

　　My father and grandfather were both poor school teachers. The education I received from childhood was semi-feudal, forming some stale ideas and cultivating a mild and reserved psychological habit. Due to a combination of circumstances, I spent more than ten years as a student in several British and French universities, circling around in the capitalist forms of literature, history, and philosophy. At the beginning of this period, an unprecedented change occurred in Chinese culture and thought—the May Fourth Movement. I was confined to a foreign school, and such a great change swept past me, but I was oblivious to it. This was the great misfortune of my life. History moved forward a long way, but I was still stuck at the starting point of the change. I became detached from the reality of the Chinese era.

　　In my student days, I was infected by the old concept of "learning for the sake of learning" of European scholasticism, and I spent my days with books, losing contact with all kinds of real-world problems in the great world, and thus losing interest. Practical politics, in particular, made me shrink back in fear, as if it were something dirty. When I returned to China in '22, I taught in the Foreign Languages ​​Department of Peking University. At that time, my simple aspiration was to stick to my post, teach the books a little better, read more books, and write more books. If I had any slight political consciousness, it was just a vague European and American-style democracy and liberalism. When the War of Resistance Against Japan broke out in '26, I transferred to Sichuan University. The president of the university was an old colleague from the Philosophy Department of Peking University, who ran the school conscientiously, but because he did not know how to flatter the Minister of Education, Chen Lifu, he was dismissed after a year and replaced by his crony, Cheng Tianfang. At that time, from the standpoint of a free thinker, I stirred up a storm to oppose it. When the opposition failed, I resigned and left Sichuan University. This was the first time in my life that I felt the oppression of reactionary politics and rose up in resistance. When this news spread, a gentleman working in cultural work in Yan'an wrote a letter inviting me to Yan'an, and I wanted to take this opportunity to see if I could participate in more active work. Due to insufficient understanding and weakness of will, I finally failed this gentleman's good intentions and transferred to Wuhan University to continue teaching.

　　After staying at Wuhan University for three or four years, internal personnel conflicts occurred in the school. No one wanted to be the Dean of Academic Affairs, and the school insisted on pulling me in to do it. After only a year, the oppression of reactionary politics came again! Chen Lifu blamed President Wang Xinggong, saying that I opposed Cheng Tianfang and that my thinking was unstable, and that the school should not let me hold an important position. President Wang wanted to smooth things over and persuaded me to join the Kuomintang, saying that it was just a formality, a cover, for the sake of the school's safety, for the sake of my personal friendship with him, I had to help him with this. At that time, I was not attached to this position of Dean of Academic Affairs, but if I quit, the school would indeed be shaken. Therefore, I endured and compromised and joined the Kuomintang. My statement to President Wang was that I was only in name and would not participate in any activities. This is something that I have always felt guilty about. Joining a political party in itself is not a bad thing, what I feel ashamed of is that as an advocate of freedom of thought, for the sake of temporary convenience, I took this perfunctory attitude and joined a political party that I did not want to join.

　　After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, I returned to Peking University with a sense of vigilance, wanting to avoid being drawn into the party vortex again, wanting to stick to the simple aspiration I had when I first arrived at Peking University more than ten years ago: to stick to my post, teach the books a little better, read more books, and write more books. But things did not go as planned. On the one hand, the Kuomintang government was getting worse and worse, forcing even people like me who had no interest in politics to feel anxious and worried. On the other hand, I had always written articles haphazardly, and friends from newspapers and magazines often came to solicit manuscripts, forcing me to write some articles that now seem to have wrong views, and even to sign my name in agreement with reactionary articles written by others. Here, I can roughly talk about my political attitude in the past few years. Like every national who hoped China would be good, I was extremely dissatisfied with the Kuomintang government; but it was a government that I had contact with, and I fantasized that if China was to be good, this government had to be good; if it was not good, we still had to hope that it would be good. Most of the speeches I made took this attitude, pointing out the problems at the time. Due to my past education, I was a moderate reformist, and of course I had no revolutionary consciousness. My mistakes have been fully demonstrated by the facts, and there is no need to elaborate here.

　　Before liberation, my understanding of the Communist Party's propositions and style was extremely vague and indistinct. What I saw was only the Kuomintang's official magazines and newspapers, and what I came into contact with were only people of roughly the same age and views as me, and I had always been in a state of being blinded by malicious propaganda. It was not until after the liberation of Beijing that I began to understand the Communist Party. What moved me most was the Communist Party cadres' spirit of hard work and endurance, conscientiousness, humility and caution, genuine enthusiasm for serving the people, and the fearless spirit of overcoming difficulties head-on. I suddenly realized that the Communist Party I had heard about before was not like that at all. From the Kuomintang's style to the Communist Party's style is simply from darkness to light, truly a change of world. There is no longer any perfunctory behavior, corruption, extravagance, and all kinds of crimes of using public office for private gain and betraying the country. Anyone can feel that this is a new atmosphere. Since the Xinhai Revolution, we have taken many detours, always hoping after disappointment. Now we can be considered to be on the right path and have found vitality. This is the scene that excites me the most.

　　Secondly, following my colleagues and classmates, I began to read some Communist Party books, such as the Communist Manifesto, the History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Selected Works of Mao Zedong, and works on materialism and dialectics. In this regard, I am still a primary school student and dare not say that I have a completely correct understanding, but in the main points I have grasped the philosophy on which communism is based, the process of the Soviet revolution, and Chairman Mao's theory and policies of new democracy. I believe that the path taken by the Communist Party is a great road that the world should take in theory and must take in fact.

　　Examining myself from a new understanding of the Communist Party, my basic problem is not that I was a Kuomintang member in the past, but that my past education cultivated me into an individual liberalist, an intellectual who is detached from reality, with narrow views and weak will. I am willing to continue to study hard, try hard to correct my shortcomings, and try hard to keep up with the times and the masses, so that I will not become a completely useless person in the new society. There are also some advantages in my character, diligence, humility, and not being pessimistic in the face of difficulties. These advantages may be the buds of my new life.

　　自我检讨
    朱光潜
    中国人民革命这个大运动转变了整个世界，也转变了我个人。我个人的转变不过是大海波浪中一点小浪纹，渺小到值不得注意，可是它也是受大潮流的推动，并非出于偶然。
    我的父祖都是清寒的教书人。我从小所受的就是半封建式的教育，形成了一些陈腐的思想，也养成了一种温和而拘谨的心理习惯。由于机缘的凑合，我在几个英法大学里做了十余年的学生，在资本主义形态的文学，历史学和哲学里兜了一些圈子。就在这个时期的开始，中国文化思想上发生了一个空前的变动—五四运动。我关在一个外国学校里，这样大的一个变动掠我而过，而我却茫然若无其事。这是我生平的大不幸。历史向前走了一长段路，而我还停滞在变动的出发点。我脱离了中国现实时代。
    在学生时代，我受了欧洲经院的“为学问而学问”那个老观念的传染，整天抱着书本子过活，对于大世界中种种现实问题失去了接触，也就失去了兴趣。实际政治尤其使我望而生畏，仿佛它是一种污糟的东西。二十二年回国，我就在北大外文系任教。当时我的简单的志愿是谨守岗位，把书教好一点，再多读一些书，多写一些书。假如说我有些微政治意识的话，那只是一种模糊的欧美式的民主自由主义。二十六年抗日战事起，我转到四川大学。校长是一位北大哲学系的旧同事，倒是规规矩矩的办学，可是因为不会逢迎教育部长陈立夫，过了一年就被撤了职，换了他的党侣程天放。当时我以一个自由思想者的立场，掀起风潮去反对。反对不成，我就辞了职离开四川大学。这是我生平第一次感到反动政治的压迫而起反抗。这消息传出去了，一位在延安做文化工作的先生曾经写信邀我去延安，我很想趁这个机会去看看我能否参加比较积极的工作。由于认识的不够和意志的薄弱，我终于辜负了这位先生的好意，转到武汉大学去继续教书。
    在武大待了三四年，学校内部发生人事冲突，教务长没有人干，学校硬要拉我去干。干了不过一年，反动政治的压迫又来了！陈立夫责备王星拱校长，说我反对过程天放，思想不稳，学校不应该让我担任要职。王校长想息事宁人，苦劝我加入国民党，说这只是一个名义，一个幌子，为着学校的安全，为着我和他私人的友谊，我都得帮他这一个忙。当时我也并非留恋这个教务长，可是假如我丢了不干，学校确实难免动摇。因此，我隐忍妥协，加入了国民党。我向王校长的声明是只居名义，不参加任何活动。这是我始终引为内疚的一件事。参加一个政党本身并不是一件坏事，我所感到渐愧的是我以一个主张思想自由者，为了一时的方便，取这种敷衍的态度，参加了我不愿意参加的一个政党。
    抗战胜利后我回到北大，就怀了一个戒心，想不要再转入党的漩涡，想再抱定十余年前初到北大时那个简单的志愿，谨守岗位，把书教好一点，再多读一些书，多写一些书。可是事与愿违，一则国民党政府越弄越糟，逼得象我这样无心于政治的人也不得不焦虑忧惧；二则我向来胡乱写些文章，报章杂志的朋友们常来拉稿，逼得我写了一些于今看来是见解错误的文章，甚至签名附和旁人写的反动的文章。在这里我可以约略说一说过去几年中我的政治态度。象每个望中国好的国民一样，我对于国民党政府是极端不满意的；不过它是一个我所接触到的政府，我幻想要中国好，必须要这个政府好；它不好，我们总还要希望它好。我所发表的言论大半是采取这个态度，就当时的毛病加以指责。由于过去的教育，我是一个温和的改良主义者，当然没有革命的意识。我的错误已经由事实充分证明，这里也无须详说。
    在解放以前，我对于共产党的主张和作风的认识极端模糊隐约，所看到的只是国民党官方的杂志报纸，所接触到的只是和我年龄见解差不多的人物，一向处在恶意宣传的蒙蔽里。自从北京解放以后，我才开始了解共产党。首先使我感动的是共产党干部的刻苦耐劳，认真做事的作风，谦虚谨慎的态度，真正要为人民服务的热忱，以及迎头克服困难那种大无畏的精神。我才恍然大悟从前所听到的共产党满不是那么一回事。从国民党的作风到共产党的作风简直是由黑暗到光明，真正是换了一个世界。这里不再有因循敷衍，贪污腐败，骄奢淫佚，以及种种假公济私卖国便已的罪行。任何人都会感觉到这是一种新兴的气象。从辛亥革命以来，我们绕了许多湾子，总是希望之后继以失望，现在我们才算走上大路，得到生机。这是我最感觉兴奋的景象。
    其次，我跟着同事同学们学习，开始读到一些共产党的书籍，象共产党宣言、联共党史、毛泽东选集以及关于唯物论辩证法的著作之类。在这方面我还是一个初级小学生，不敢说有完全正确的了解，但在大钢要旨上我已经抓住了共产主义所根据的哲学，苏联革命奋斗的经过，以及毛主席的新民主主义的理论和政策。我认为共产党所走的是世界在理论上所应走而在事实上所必走的一条大路。
    从对于共产党的新了解来检讨我自己，我的基本的毛病倒不在我过去是一个国民党员，而在我的过去教育把我养成一个个人自由主义者，一个脱离现实的见解褊狭而意志不坚定的知识分子。我愿意继续努力学习，努力纠正我的毛病，努力赶上时代与群众，使我在新社会中不至成为一个完全无用的人。我的性格中也有一些优点，勤奋，虚心，遇事不悲观，这些优点也许可以做我的新生的萌芽。
