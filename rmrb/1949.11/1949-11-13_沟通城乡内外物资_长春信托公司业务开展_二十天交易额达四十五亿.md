    Connecting Urban and Rural Materials
    Changchun Trust Company Develops Business
    Twenty-Day Transaction Volume Reaches 4.5 Billion
    [Our Newspaper] Since its opening, under the specific guidelines of implementing the development of production, economic prosperity, urban-rural mutual assistance, and internal and external exchange, and under the correct leadership of the Municipal Government's Bureau of Industry and Commerce, the business of the Changchun Trust Company has been developing daily. From September 10th to October 5th, in just over twenty days, a total of 1,326 transactions were made, with a transaction volume of 4,531,100,000 yuan. Among these, state-owned enterprises and cooperatives accounted for 65 percent, and private businesses accounted for 35 percent. At the beginning of its operation, the company experienced some confusion due to a small staff, unclear division of labor. Through strengthened administrative leadership, a unified organizational structure was gradually established, personnel were reasonably allocated, responsibilities were clarified, and fire prevention, theft prevention, and the conscientious implementation of reward and punishment regulations were strengthened. Now it has stepped onto the right track. In the past, the company's connections with various parties were insufficient, and market information was not readily available, which prevented the consignment and purchasing work from being carried out effectively. Now, after timely review and research, the company has gradually dispatched a large number of external liaison officers to establish commercial information networks and business relationships with cooperatives in various regions. To date, it has established consignment and purchasing relationships with more than 210 state-owned enterprises, cooperatives, and private businesses in major cities in Northeast and North China. It has also established communication relationships with 288 units in various regions. The price dynamics of cities in various locations are now able to be initially grasped. At the same time, it has also established connections with various public and private enterprises and cooperatives in the city, laying a preliminary foundation for connecting urban and rural relations in various regions and exchanging materials between the north and south.

    沟通城乡内外物资
    长春信托公司业务开展
    二十天交易额达四十五亿
    【本报讯】长春信托公司开幕以来，在贯彻发展生产，繁荣经济，城乡互助，内外交流的具体方针及市府工商局的正确领导下，营业已日趋发展。自九月十日至十月五日二十多天来，共交易一、三二六笔，交易额四十五亿三千一百余万元。其中公营企业及合作社占百分之六十五，私商占百分之三十五。该公司在开办之初，因人员少，分工不明确，工作较混乱。经行政上加强领导，逐步建立了统一组织机构，合理配备人员，明确负责，并加强了防火防盗和认真执行奖惩条例，现已步入正轨。过去该公司与各方面的连系不够，行情不灵通，致使代销代购工作未能很好展开。现该公司及时进行检讨与研究后，逐步派出大批对外连络员与各地合作社建立商情通讯网及业务关系。到目前为止，已和东北、华北各大城市的公营企业、合作社及私商二百十余家建立了代销代购关系。并和各地区二八八个单位建立了来往通讯关系。各地城市物价动态已能初步掌握。同时和本市各公、私营企业及各合作社也建立了联系，在沟通各地区城乡关系，交流南北物资上，初步奠定了基础。
