However, after a few days, Xi Lu became uneasy again. He pondered that although his East Kiln was flooded, the West Kiln could still produce coal after the autumn harvest, and he didn't want to give it up after all. Besides, he was still afraid of offending Jubao, and he was also a bit afraid of the disturbance caused by the Old Lord. Moreover, it seemed that someone in Yangquan knew about the affairs of the kiln. Some merchants he used to be familiar with now seemed to be deliberately avoiding him, and they didn't interact with him much. He thought that things wouldn't be good for him if this continued. But what could he do? Just then, his second son ran to tell him that Jubao was very angry and was sending Qian Danao to demand payment every day, and was even shouting that Xi Lu should find Da San to pay for his life! As his second son spoke, his lips trembled. He couldn't help but scold him: "Look at your useless self! Do you think they'll kill us?" But he himself was just as afraid. He wanted to pay the debt first, but he couldn't raise the money. He wanted to find someone to mediate, but there was no suitable person, and even Yu Bao really didn't look for him anymore! As he procrastinated, another month or two passed. The rumors about the disturbances in the village were still frightening. Then, other village chiefs came to discuss with him, asking him to go back and settle the matter. He said he wanted Jubao to come up with a solution, but they said that Jubao insisted that he come up with a solution, but what solution did he have? This really made him even more hateful and angry! Later, he heard that the villagers were also making trouble all day long, asking the she chief to come up with a solution, but Jubao said he was going to sue him in the city. Even the big kiln owner in Liugou was dissatisfied with him and also advocated that Jubao file a lawsuit. While he lived in Yangquan, he didn't even have a single acquaintance to interact with, and it seemed that people didn't dare to buy things at his small shop. Even his two sons urged him to go back and find a solution. Only then did he make up his mind: Anyway, it's just spending money! I'll go back! Let's see what you, Jubao, can do! Unexpectedly, just then, the Japanese devils invaded China, and everyone panicked. Later, they heard that China had resisted the war, but then the Japanese devils occupied Taiyuan Prefecture and the Zhengtai Railway. Many shops in Yangquan closed down and went home, and Xi Lu also returned to the village. Jubao didn't mention the big kiln, and no one even mentioned the disturbance caused by the Old Lord. Xi Lu decided to wait and see! He still didn't discuss the kiln with Jubao.

In the winter, Xi Lu saw that the businesses in Yangquan were slowly reopening. He thought: Anyway, I won't deal with the Japanese! Maybe it's okay to open a business! So he took his family to Yangquan again to open the small shop. But soon after he went to Yangquan, he saw Jubao and the chief shes and village chiefs of many nearby villages enter Pingding City and start dealing with the Japanese. After returning to the village, the Japanese still appointed them as village chiefs! Xi Lu was angry but there was nothing he could do. Moreover, the story of the Old Lord's disturbance in the village spread again! Jubao sent someone to call Xi Lu back again. Xi Lu thought there was no other way, so he went back to discuss with trepidation.

This time, when Jubao saw Xi Lu, he didn't say anything and was very straightforward: First, Xi Lu had to pay to rebuild the Old Lord Temple and the opera stage; second, he had borrowed money from Liugou, and if it was not repaid by the deadline, the interest would snowball into two hundred silver dollars, which had to be paid off immediately. When Xi Lu heard this, he almost passed out from anger. He was stunned for a while, then hardened his heart and said, "A small shop, twenty or so acres of land: that's all I have! See how you want to deal with it!" Jubao slapped the table and cursed, "Are you playing the rogue, you bastard?" Qian Danao and the other two chief shes quickly persuaded and mediated. After a long time, Jubao waved his hand and said impatiently, "Damn it! Anyway, it's useless for me to get angry, I'm just unlucky! As for repairing the temple, I'll risk selling some land. Xi Lu and I will each pay half, and the villagers will contribute a little more, and we'll start early. As for repaying the debt, I certainly can't pay it. Xi Lu, you say!" Xi Lu said, "What do I have to say! My small shop is heavily in debt, and I can only sell three or five acres of land, and if I sell any more, I won't have enough to eat myself. I'll just try my best to deal with it! Otherwise, I don't want the kiln either." Jubao quickly said, "Okay! You must hurry! Once the money is collected, you can take charge of repairing the temple!" Xi Lu knew that he couldn't take charge, so he didn't agree. Jubao said impatiently, "Anyway, I have to do everything! How many days can we live like this! The Japanese are here and I have to support them, and I have to organize the repair of the temple! When you're asked to do something for the public, you're not willing to shed a drop of sweat! Okay, Qian Danao will take charge!" So, the village was lively again: performing operas, hosting guests, offering sacrifices, painting the temple halls, god statues, murals, and the opera stage... a whole set of pomp. However, Xi Lu didn't participate much in these things. He only sold a few acres of land, repaid the debt, and gave the rest of the money to Qian Danao, not knowing if it was enough to repair the temple. He was angry and ignored it, simply living in Yangquan. After some time, he heard rumors that the temple in Black Stone Slope Village was repaired quite well, and there were no more disturbances in the village. He felt relieved about one thing, but he didn't say anything.

　　黑石坡煤窑演义（２５）
    康濯
    不过，没过了几天，喜禄却又不放心。他捉摸着他那东窑虽说淹了，可西窑秋后还能出炭，他到底不想撂了；再说，他也还是怕得罪了聚宝，那老君爷闹响动的事他也有些着怕；而且窑上的事阳泉也象有人知道，过去有些跟他很熟快的字号商家，这阵子见了他总象有意躲着他，也不大跟他来往，他想着这么下去对自己没好处。可怎么办呢？正在这时，他二小跑来告他：说是聚宝很生气，天天打发乾大脑来要帐，并口口声声要喜禄寻大三回来抵命！他二小一边说，一边两片嘴唇直哆嗦，他不禁骂道：“看你那球样！你怕人家会宰了咱们么？”但他自己心中也一样地着怕；他想先还了帐再说别的，可实在又筹不出款；想寻个什么人来圆转一下，却没合适的人，就连玉宝也真个再不找他了！这么摩摩蹭蹭地，又是一两个月，村里闹响动的事还是风言风语挺着怕；接着就有村里别的社首来跟他商议，叫他回去了结这事、他说叫聚宝拿出办法来、但人家说聚宝是非叫他想办法不行，可他有什么办法？这真叫他更恨更生气！后来，又听说村里老百姓也闹得整天找社里叫想法，聚宝却说是要到城里去告他，连柳沟大窑主也不满意他，也主张聚宝打官司，而他住在阳泉，竟连一个熟人跟他交往的也没有了，他这小铺好象人们也不敢来买东西了，连他俩小也催他回去想办法了，他这才拿了个主意：反正是花钱呗！回去就回去！看你聚宝怎么着！不想正在这时，日本鬼子打进了咱中国，人人慌乱，后来又听说咱中国抗了战，但紧接着日本鬼子占了太原府，占了正太铁路，阳泉好多商号关门回家，喜禄也回了村，聚宝也没提起大窑的事，连老君爷闹响动的事也没什么人提了。喜禄也就拖拖再看吧！还是没找聚宝商议窑上的事。
    到冬天，喜禄看着阳泉买卖家开张的又慢慢多了，他想：反正不跟日本人打交道呗！开买卖许没事吧！就又领上他大小开小铺去了。但他去阳泉不久，却见聚宝和左近不少村子的总社首村长们进了平定城，跟日本打上了交道，回村来日本还是派他们当村长！喜禄生气也没有法，而且村里老君爷闹响动的事又传开了！聚宝又派人叫喜禄回去，喜禄想想也没别的法，这才提心吊胆地回去商议。
    这回聚宝见了喜禄，什么也没说，干干脆脆：第一，叫喜禄掏钱重修老君庙和戏楼；第二，借柳沟的款，过期不还，利滚利滚成了二百白洋，叫立时还清。喜禄听了这，差点没气量过去；他傻愣了一阵，就心一横说道：“一个小铺，二十来亩地：我就这点家当！你看怎么拾掇吧！”聚宝拍着桌子骂道：“你他妈耍无赖么？”旁边乾大脑和别两个社首赶紧劝说、圆转，过了半天，聚宝才一挥手，挺不耐烦地说：“＠他妈的！反正我生气动火的也不顶，我倒霉吧！修庙的事，我拚着卖点地，喜禄一半我一半，村里家户再取上点，赶早动手。还帐嘛，反正不能我来还。喜禄你说吧！”喜禄道：“我有什么说的！我小铺背了一身饥荒，地吧也只能卖个三亩五亩的，再多了就自己也不够吃了。我反正紧着对付吧！要不，窑我也不要了。”聚宝忙说：“行！你当紧些闹！款齐了嘛，你来张罗主事修庙吧！”喜禄明知自己不能主事，就没答应；聚宝又挺不耐烦地说：“反正什么也得我！咱这还能活几天啊！日本来了也得我支应，修庙也得我张罗！叫你们为公众办点事的，你们是一滴汗也舍不得流！好吧，乾大脑张罗吧！”于是，村里又一阵热闹：唱戏、请客、供祭、粉刷庙殿神像壁画和戏楼……一大套排场。不过这些事喜禄没怎么沾边，他只卖了几亩地，还了帐，剩下的也不知够不够修庙的款，都给了乾大脑，自己生气不理，干脆住在阳泉。过了些时，他听人传言：说是黑石坡村的庙修的挺不赖，村里响动什么的也没有了；他心上算是放下了一件事，可也没说什么话。
