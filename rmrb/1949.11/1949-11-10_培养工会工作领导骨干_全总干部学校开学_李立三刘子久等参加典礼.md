Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, November 9th: The All-China Federation of Trade Unions Cadre School held its first opening ceremony in Tianjin on the 8th. Li Lisan, the school's principal and vice-chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and Liu Zihui, the Minister of Culture and Education, came to Tianjin from Beijing to attend the ceremony. Huang Huoqing, Director of the Tianjin Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Preparatory Committee, was also present. In his speech at the meeting, Li Lisan pointed out that to do a good job in trade union work, cadres are the decisive condition. If there are not enough cadres with awareness, theoretical foundation, trade union work knowledge, and experience, it will be difficult to achieve results. Therefore, cultivating cadres has become a very important prerequisite for doing a good job in trade union work. Li Lisan continued: To cultivate a sufficient number of leading cadres with considerable ability, we need to study well. We not only need pure trade union work experience and knowledge, but also basic knowledge of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Secondly, we must learn from the Soviet Union's experience, which can save us detours. Furthermore, we must learn from the experience of the Chinese workers' movement and the Chinese revolution. Combining these three types of learning will enable us to become leading cadres for trade union work with comprehensive knowledge. In his speech, Liu Zihui encouraged everyone to study hard and become good teachers who educate the working masses and their families, and to play a backbone role in unifying the national workers' movement. Speeches were also given by Huang Huoqing, Director of the Tianjin Federation of Trade Unions Preparatory Committee, Yang Zhihua, Deputy Minister of the Women Workers Department of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Zhang Yunying, Vice Principal of the school, and Wang Yuexuan, a representative of the students.

　　培养工会工作领导骨干
    全总干部学校开学
  　李立三刘子久等参加典礼
    【新华社天津九日电】中华全国总工会干部学校于八日在津市举行第一期开学典礼。该校校长、中华全国总工会副主席李立三、文教部部长刘子久等，由京来津参加典礼，津市总工会筹委会主任黄火青亦到会。李立三在大会上讲话时指出：要把工会工作搞好，干部是决定的条件。如果不是有足够数量、有觉悟、有理论基础、有工会工作知识与经验的干部，工作是很难做出成绩的。所以培养干部成为把工会工作搞好的非常重要的前提。李立三接着说：要培养足够数量相当能力的领导干部，就须要很好地学习。不仅有单纯的工会工作经验、知识，而且要求有马列主义毛泽东思想的基本知识。其次是要学习苏联的经验，这可以使我们少走弯路。再就是要学习中国工人运动的经验，中国革命的经验。这三种学习结合起来，就能成为一个有全面知识的工会工作领导干部。刘子久在讲话时勉励大家努力学习，使自己成为一个教育工人群众、教育工人家属的好教员，在统一全国工运中起骨干作用。接着讲话的尚有天津总工会筹委会主任黄火青、全国总工会女工部副部长杨之华、该校副校长张云莹，以及该校学员代表王月轩。
    【又讯】全总干部学校第一批学员原定为七百人，现已到校者有东北、华北、华东、山东、华中及北京、上海、天津、武汉等地区的学员五百九十五人，西北等地尚未到齐。其中各战略区、直属市、省级及分区普通市之工会干部占多数；并有铁路、海员、邮电、煤矿、钢铁、机器、军工、纺织等系统的工会干部和较大工厂的工会主席。学员中有劳动英雄及生产模范四十余人。
