　　Shanghai Establishes Night Middle Schools
  　Over Two Thousand Out-of-School Youths Register
    [Shanghai News] The Shanghai Municipal People's Government Education Bureau has established six night middle schools in various districts of the city. In the past two days, enrollment has been extremely enthusiastic. More than 2,600 industrial workers, shop assistants, handicraftsmen, and impoverished out-of-school youths have regained the opportunity to study. Chen Yimin, a worker at Hengxing Hosiery Factory, said during registration: "I have been out of school for three years. Yesterday, I heard from a comrade in the trade union's cultural and educational department that 'out-of-school people can register for night middle school.' So I rushed here immediately." Yang Xiaomao, an apprentice at Longfeng Cloth Store, said: "I have been an apprentice in the store for four and a half years. Now that I have a place to study, I feel like I have a bright future." Lan Baolin, who was in the second year of junior high school at Sanlin Middle School in Pudong last year but had to work as a shop assistant due to family poverty, specially rushed to Gezhi Middle School to register at 9:30 p.m. on the 4th. Tuition at night middle schools is waived, with only miscellaneous fees charged: 3,000 yuan for junior high school and 4,000 yuan for senior high school. Those with financial difficulties can still apply for exemption with proof. The night middle schools in each district are scheduled to open on the 12th of this month and officially begin classes on the 14th.

  　二千余失学青年前往报名
    【上海讯】上海市人民政府教育局在该市各区创办了六个夜中学，一、二两日来，报名入学者极为踊跃，二千六百余产业工人、店员、手工业者及贫苦的失学青年，重得学习机会。恒兴袜衫厂工人陈义民在报名时说：“我失学已三年了，昨日听到工会文教科同志告诉我们‘失学的人，都可以到夜中学去报名入学’。于是我立刻就赶了来。”隆丰布庄学徒杨小毛说：“我在店内已做了四年半学徒，如今有了读书的地方，我就感到有光明的前途了。”去年在浦东三林中学初二念书后因家贫而作店员的蓝保林，在四日晚上九点半钟时，还特地赶到格致中学去报名。夜中学学费一律免收，仅收杂费：初中三千元，高中四千元。清寒有证明者仍可申请免缴。现各区夜中学，择于本月十二日开学，十四日正式上课。
