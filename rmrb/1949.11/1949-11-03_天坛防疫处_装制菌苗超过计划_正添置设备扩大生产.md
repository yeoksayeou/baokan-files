Tian Tan Epidemic Prevention Center

	Installing More Bacterial Vaccine Than Planned

	Expanding Production by Adding Equipment

	[Our Newspaper's News] Since the Tian Tan Epidemic Prevention Center started rushing to produce plague vaccine, the morale of the staff has been rising day by day. Each labor union group has formulated production competition plans and challenged each other. The labor union bulletin board set up a "ring," and the challenge letters were plastered all over the wall. The bacterial vaccine room was originally scheduled to dilute 300,000 cubic centimeters of bacterial vaccine per day (the final step in bacterial vaccine manufacturing is to dilute the thick bacterial suspension with physiological saline, this process is called "dilution," the undiluted thick suspension is called "stock solution"), but in recent days it has exceeded the plan. On October 30th, 400,000 cubic centimeters were diluted, 540,000 cubic centimeters were produced on the 31st, and this number was maintained on November 1st. The filling and packaging room not only completed all these fillings on the same day, but also challenged the bacterial vaccine room, demanding to fill 580,000 cubic centimeters every day, as long as the bacterial vaccine room could produce it. In order not to delay the needs of the bacterial vaccine room, the culture medium room is rushing to produce culture medium day and night. Some people only sleep five or six hours a day. The hands of those cutting meat are blistered (bacteria must be cultured with beef soaked in water, removing fat and tendons, and machines cannot be used), but they still do not rest. Chen Defang, who burns the boiler, can't sleep during the day after working the night shift. He said, "Lying in bed and thinking about others working, hearing people talking, I feel anxious." The newly made stock solution is being stepped up, and dilution can begin in the middle of the month. Because of the high work morale and the full play of human resources, the production tools are no longer suitable for application. Now the department is adding equipment and ordering a large number of glassware in order to expand the production plan again.

### 天坛防疫处　装制菌苗超过计划　正添置设备扩大生产

　　天坛防疫处
  　装制菌苗超过计划
  　正添置设备扩大生产
    【本报讯】天坛防疫处自从开始赶制鼠疫菌苗以来，职工情绪一天比一天高。各工会小组分别定出生产竞赛计划，互相挑战。工会壁报设了“擂台”，挑战书贴满了一墙。菌苗室原定每日稀释菌苗三十万公撮（菌苗制造最后一步是把浓厚的细菌悬液加生理盐水冲淡，这过程叫作“稀释”，未冲淡的浓厚悬液叫作“原液”），可是这几天都超过了计划，十月三十日稀释出四十万公撮，三十一日出了五十四万公撮，十一月一日也保持这个数目。分装包装室不但把这些都当天装完，而且向菌苗室挑战，每天要装五十八万公撮，只要菌苗室作得出。培养基室为了不误菌苗室需用，日夜赶制培养基，好些人一天只睡五六小时。切肉的手起了泡（培养细菌须用牛肉浸水，剔出脂肪及筋，不能用机器），但仍不休息。烧锅炉的陈德芳晚上打了夜班白天睡觉睡不着，他说：“睡在床上想到旁人干活，听到人说话，心里着急。”新制原液正在加紧赶，月中可以开始稀释。因为工作情绪高，人力充分发挥，生产工具已不符应用。现在该处正添置设备，定购大批玻璃器，以便再度扩大生产计划。
