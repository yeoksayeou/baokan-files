　　The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Work is Progressing Rapidly
    Nearly Two Million Members Nationwide
  　Several Regions are Consolidating Organizations and Strengthening Education
    [By Our Newspaper] Amidst the celebration of the 32nd anniversary of the Soviet Union's October Revolution, the slogans "Enhance Sino-Soviet Friendship," "The Chinese and Soviet people will be forever friendly and cooperative," and "Learn from the Soviet Union" resound throughout the country. Under the unified leadership of the National Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and driven by the unanimous demands of the broad masses of the people, the work of the newly established Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has made rapid progress across the country.
    Currently, except for the newly liberated areas in the South, branches of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association have been successively established in major and medium-sized cities across the country under the unified leadership of the National Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, with the total number of members estimated to be nearly two million. In the Northeast, after the "August 15th" incident in 1945, Dalian, Harbin, and other places in northern Manchuria began to organize Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations. Up to now, Heihe, Manzhouli, Hailar, Ang'angxi, Qiqihar, Anda, Bei'an, Suihua, Jiamusi, Mudanjiang, Suifenhe, Harbin, Changchun, Siping, Jilin, Fushun, Anshan, Benxi, Shenyang, Andong, Jinzhou, Luda and other cities, as well as Inner Mongolia, have successively established branches of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. Branches have also been established in several cities, counties, and districts. The Northeast General Branch was officially established this year on "August 15th," and provincial branches were established in Heilongjiang, Liaodong, Jilin, Songjiang, Liaoxi, and Rehe provinces. The total number of members in the entire Northeast is 504,654, and the number of members in Luda has reached 202,244. The National Sino-Soviet Friendship Association initiated preparations on July 16th of this year and was officially established on October 5th, giving great impetus to the preparatory work of the local branches of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. Up to now, major and medium-sized cities within the customs have successively established branches or preparatory committees of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association in Beijing, Tianjin, Zhangjiakou, Qinhuangdao, Shanhaiguan, Tangshan, Fengzhen, Jining, Xuanhua, Datong, Baoding, Shijiazhuang, Taiyuan, Jinan, Qingdao, Xuzhou, Zhengzhou, Xi'an, Wuhan, Bengbu, Nanjing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, and other cities. The provincial branches of Hebei, Chahar, and Suiyuan will also be established soon. According to the materials already obtained, the number of members in Qingdao alone has reached 150,000. The branches in Luda, Zhangjiakou, and Beijing have also expanded into the countryside.
    Because the work of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association is in line with the unanimous demands of the broad masses of the people and is led by the local Party and government leaders, the work has progressed very rapidly. In some places, it has already moved from general propaganda activities to regular activities of consolidating organizations and strengthening education. Since this year, the Northeast has gone deeper into the masses, strengthened mass internationalist education, consolidated organizations (the most basic organization in Luda has penetrated into group meetings, with 13,000 groups in the entire Luda area), and established regular work. Recently, it is preparing to carry out typical work in four places: Heilongjiang, Shenyang, Anshan, and Fushun. Zhangjiakou is also preparing to create typical experiences in factories, rural areas, and schools to carry out work.

　　中苏友协工作进展飞速
    全国会员近二百万
  　若干地区正巩固组织加强教育
    【本报讯】际此庆祝苏联十月革命三十二周年纪念之际，“增强中苏友谊”，“中苏人民永远友好合作”，“向苏联学习”的呼声响遍全国。成立不久的中苏友好协会的工作在全国广大人民一致要求和推动下，已得到了迅速的进展。
    现在全国除南方新解放区外，在中苏友好协会总会统一领导下，各大中城市陆续成立了中苏友好协会分会，会员总数估计将近二百万人。东北在一九四五年的“八一五”后，大连、哈尔滨及北满各地即开始组织中苏友好协会，迄目前止，黑河、满州里、海拉尔、昂昂溪、齐齐哈尔、安达、北安、绥化、佳木斯、牡丹江、绥芬河、哈尔滨、长春、四平、吉林、抚顺、鞍山、本溪、沈阳、安东、锦州、旅大等城市及内蒙都已先后成立了中苏友好协会分会，若干市、县和区也成立了分会组织。东北总分会在今年“八一五”正式成立，黑龙江、辽东、吉林、松江、辽西、热河各省又成立了省分会；全东北的会员有五十万四千六百五十四人，旅大会员已达二十万二千二百四十四人。中苏友好协会总会自本年七月十六日发起筹备，十月五日正式成立，予各地中苏友好协会分会的筹备工作以极大的推动，迄目前止，关内的各大中城市，已有北京、天津、张家口、秦皇岛、山海关、唐山、丰镇、集宁、宣化、大同、保定、石家庄、太原、济南、青岛、徐州、郑州、西安、武汉、蚌埠、南京、上海、杭州等城市先后成立中苏友好协会分会或筹备会，河北、察哈尔、绥远的省分会也将在最近成立，据已得到的材料，会员数目仅青岛一地即达十五万人。旅大、张家口和北京的分会并已发展到农村中。
    中苏友好协会的工作因为符合于广大人民的一致要求，又由各地党政负责人领导，工作进展非常迅速，某些地方已经由一般的宣传活动，进入到巩固组织、加强教育的经常活动。东北自本年起更深入到群众中间去，加强群众性的国际主义教育，巩固组织（旅大最基层组织已深入到小组会，全旅大有一万三千个小组），建立经常工作。最近准备在黑龙江、沈阳、鞍山、抚顺等四个地方进行典型工作。张家口也正准备创造工厂、农村、学校，开展工作的典型经验。
