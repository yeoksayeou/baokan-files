Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 13th: TASS Berlin dispatch: Army General Chuikov, Chairman of the Soviet Control Commission in Germany, received members of the Provisional Government of the German Democratic Republic in Berlin on the 11th and issued a statement on the establishment of the Soviet Control Commission in Germany.

At noon, Premier Grotewohl, Deputy Premiers Ulbricht, Professor Kaschner, Nuschke, and various ministers of the German Democratic Republic arrived at the residence of the Chairman of the Soviet Control Commission in Karlshorst. Grotewohl first introduced the Deputy Premiers of the German Democratic Republic to Chuikov. Then, Chuikov issued the following statement on the establishment of the Soviet Control Commission in Germany:

  Original Text of Statement
    “On October 10th, I, by order of the Soviet Government, notified the Presidium of the Provisional People's Chamber and Premier Grotewohl of the Soviet Government's decision to transfer the administrative power previously belonging to the Soviet Military Government to the Provisional Government of the German Democratic Republic, and of the decision to establish the Soviet Control Commission to replace the Soviet Military Government in Germany.

    In accordance with this decision of the Soviet Government, the Soviet Control Commission has now been established in Germany. The Soviet Military Government and its central and local organs will be abolished, and their powers will be transferred to the relevant ministries and other German authorities.

    The task of the Soviet Control Commission is to supervise the implementation of the Potsdam Agreement and other joint decisions of the four powers regarding Germany. This means that the Provisional Government of the German Democratic Republic can freely exercise its functions in accordance with the Constitution of the German Democratic Republic, provided that such activities do not violate the obligations arising from the Potsdam Agreement and the joint decisions of the four powers.

    The Provisional Government has declared its support for the resolutions of the Potsdam Conference and will fulfill the obligations arising from the joint decisions of the four powers. The Soviet Government values this statement. The Soviet Control Commission retains the supervisory power: that is, to supervise that the measures taken by the Provisional Government do not violate the four powers' decisions on eliminating German militarism, on the democratization of Germany, on Germany's reparations obligations, and the decision on the right to obtain the necessary information from German organs.

    The Soviet Government believes in principle that the German Democratic Republic's relations with foreign countries and its foreign trade will be within the authority of the German authorities. In this regard, as in others, the function of the Soviet Control Commission will be to exercise the necessary supervision. In foreign trade, they will require Germany to fulfill its obligations in foreign trade.

    The representatives of the Soviet Control Commission in Berlin and the representatives in other major cities and states have the same control tasks. Therefore, in Berlin, the functions of the government are also transferred to the German democratic institutions. Regarding well-known international agreements, the representative of the Soviet Control Commission in Berlin will represent the Commission and maintain the necessary contact with the corresponding representatives of the Western occupying authorities.

    The Soviet Government will continue to fully assist in the restoration of German unity on the basis of peace and democracy, and will equally fully assist in the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany.

    Finally, let me express a belief that the spirit of mutual trust will be fully manifested between the Soviet control organs and the organs of the German Democratic Republic, which will lead to the consolidation and further development of the friendly relations between our peoples."
  Grotewohl's Reply and Thanks; Guaranteeing Never to Fail Soviet Assistance
    In his reply, Grotewohl stated that the government and people of the German Democratic Republic are deeply grateful to the Soviet Union for its assistance in the establishment of a democratic, independent, and peace-loving Germany. Grotewohl declared that we must abide by the provisions of the Potsdam Agreement and some other decisions of the four powers, and do our best to fulfill our reparations obligations, in order to eliminate the grave crimes borne by the German people. Grotewohl finally declared: "Let me express my deepest gratitude on behalf of my government, and at the same time, guarantee that in our work, we will never fail the Soviet government's trust and assistance, and in our cooperation with you, we will strive for the spirit of close friendship."

    关于德境苏联管制委员会成立
    崔可夫主席发表声明
    苏军政府行政权移交德民主政府监督德执行波茨坦协定规定义务
    【新华社北京十三日电】塔斯社柏林消息：德境苏联管制委员会主席陆军上将崔可夫，于十一日在柏林接见德意志民主共和国临时政府阁员，并就德境苏联管制委员会成立一事发表声明。
    中午，德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥、副总理乌布利希、卡斯纳教授、努舍克和各部长到达卡尔肖尔斯特苏联管制委员会主席的官邸。格罗提渥首先向崔可夫介绍了德意志民主共和国各副总理。然后，崔可夫就德境苏联管制委员会的建立一事发表声明如下：
  声明原文
    “十月十日，我奉苏联政府之命，通知临时人民议会主席团和总理格罗提渥，关于苏联政府准备将以前属于苏联军政府的行政权移交给德意志民主共和国临时政府的决定，以及关于成立苏联管制委员会以代替德境苏联军政府的决定。
    根据苏联政府的这个决定，苏联管制委员会现已在德成立。苏联军政府及其中央和地方机关，将予以撤除，它们的职权，将移交给德国的有关部会及其他德国权力机构。
    苏联管制委员会的任务，在于监督波茨坦协定及四国间关于德国的其他联合决议的执行。这就意味着：德意志民主共和国临时政府，可以根据德意志民主共和国的宪法，自由行使职权，只要这种活动不违反波茨坦决议及四国联合决议所引起的义务。
    临时政府已声明支持波茨坦会议的决议，并将履行四国联合决议所引起的义务。苏联政府重视这个声明。苏联管制委员会保留监督的职权：即监督临时政府所采取的措施，不得违反四国关于肃清德国军国主义、关于德国民主化、关于德国赔偿义务的决议，以及关于自德国机关获取所需情报之权利的决议。
    苏联政府在原则上认为：德意志民主共和国对外国的关系及其对外贸易，将在德国当局的权限之内。在这方面，和在其他方面一样，苏联管制委员会的职权将是行使必要的监督。在对外贸易方面，他们将要求德国在对外贸易上履行义务。
    驻柏林的苏联管制委员会代表及驻在其他大城市和州的代表们，都有同样的管制任务。所以，在柏林，政府的职权亦移交予德国民主的机构。在关于尽人皆知的国际协定方面，苏联管制委员会驻柏林的代表，将代表委员会，与西方国家占领当局的相当的代表们，保持必要的联系。
    苏联政府将在和平与民主的基础上，继续充分地协助恢复德国统一，并同样充分地协助与德国签订和约。
    最后，让我表示一个信念，就是：苏联管制机关与德意志民主共和国机关之间，将充分表现互相信任的精神，这将导向我们人民之间的友谊关系的巩固和进一步的发展。”
  格罗提渥答词致谢  保证决不负苏联的帮助
    格罗提渥在致答词时表示：德意志民主共和国政府和德国人民，对苏联在民主、独立与爱好和平的德国的建立中所给予的帮助，深为感激。格罗提渥声明，我们必须遵守波茨坦协定的条文和四国其他的一些决定，并且尽我们最大的力量，履行我们的赔偿义务，以消弭德国人民所负的重罪。格罗提渥最后宣称：“让我代表我的政府表示最深的感激，同时，并保证在我们的工作中，我们决不会辜负苏联政府对我们的信任和帮助，我们在和你们的合作中，定将为亲密的友谊的精神而努力。”
