　　　　　Thirty-Four: Suffocation

　　Old Yin stayed for seven or eight days. He gradually got to know more people in the village, but he never sought out Yu Bao. Yu Bao didn't dare to look for him either, quietly closing his small shop, and his committee stopped doing any work. But Old Yin didn't seem to be doing any work either. All day long, he sought out the poorest of the poor, asking each person to dredge up the suffering and hardship they had endured throughout their lives. Whether in the cave dwellings, dark houses, fields, or threshing grounds, he would spend ages chatting with people. After you told him your苦(suffering/bitterness), he would carefully and methodically analyze it with you: Where did this 苦 come from? Why did you suffer this 苦? How can you avoid suffering 苦?... He truly enlightened people's minds and opened their eyes, filling them with joy and energy. If someone couldn't express the knot in their heart clearly at first, he would pester them three or five times until they were completely clear-headed. So much so that even someone like Tian Lu would always want to seek out Old Yin to talk to when he had nothing to do, and Shuan Cheng would stick with Old Yin all the time. Later, the women and wives also liked to seek out Old Yin to talk to. Liu Gou's wife spoke with Old Yin for half the night, crying the whole time. And there was Bai Quan's wife, who had lived with Liu Gou's wife since liberation, sharing some fruit and cultivating a little land, never visiting neighbors or speaking to anyone. She used to avoid Old Yin when she saw him, but now, seeing Liu Gou's wife pouring out her grievances and crying, she couldn't help but weep as well, speaking and venting her own suffering. It all made people's minds lively and active.

　　Only Da San was different from the others. Once, Old Yin was at Bian Xiao's house, asking Da San to talk about his苦. Da San said, "I've suffered under the窯(kiln/mine) for most of my life. I've experienced planting fields, carrying shoulder poles, begging for food, and suffering from cold and hunger. What good does it do to talk about those things!" Old Yin said, "Then tell me, why did you suffer?" Da San said, "Because of the oppression by the Japanese devils, the traitor Yan Xishan, and the rich!" Old Yin asked again, "In your opinion, how can we avoid suffering?" Da San said, "Fight those bastard guys, damn it!" "But how do we fight?" "You, Hua Da, lead us!" Old Yin laughed, and Bian Xiao and Shuan Cheng beside him also laughed. After a while, Old Yin slowly explained to Da San some of the principles of诉苦(speaking bitterness),翻心(turning the heart), and forming groups. Da San thought it made sense, but he was very impatient, always thinking: These are easy to say! Doing it first is better than anything! So he only listened to half of what was said and forgot the other half, not very happy. Old Yin also saw this energy of his that was different from others, and asked about his background from others, and went to his house to talk to him twice. Inadvertently, Old Yin suddenly heard that Da San had also been a small foreman on a Japanese窑! A small foreman, wasn't that a traitor's lackey who relied on Japanese power to bully and exploit the窑 black? Moreover, Old Yin felt that Da San was too awkward and somewhat resembled a rogue. He was usually dressed neatly, with gold teeth in his mouth, and his kang (brick bed) at home was fully furnished with洋磁缸(foreign porcelain cylinders), toothbrushes, compasses, and a photo of him taken in Yangquan. This didn't look like an honest sufferer... Old Yin's heart was filled with suspicion, and he gradually stopped paying attention to him and temporarily put him aside.

　　After that, Da San only saw Shuan Cheng and Tian Lu going to Bian Xiao's house every night, not knowing what they were doing for half the night, but they didn't call him to go. He was so憋闷(suffocated/frustrated) that he couldn't sleep every night, always waiting for Tian Lu to come back to ask him a few questions, but Tian Lu didn't remember things clearly and didn't speak coherently, and he was very sleepy after a day's work, so Da San couldn't ask him anything. If he asked Shuan Cheng, Shuan Cheng was full of energy at this time. He knew that Da San was being闷(frustrated), but they had just established the poor peasant group, with ten or so people including Bian Xiao, Tian Lu, Liu Gou's wife, and Bai Quan's wife. Bian Xiao and he were the leaders and deputy leaders. They held meetings every night, agreeing not to spread the word, so Shuan Cheng was always hesitant to Da San. Shuan Cheng had also wanted to pull Da San into the poor peasant group several times, but Old Yin said, "Let him stay for two days!" The others in the group also felt that he was different from others and couldn't be pulled in casually. Shuan Cheng couldn't disagree, so he was too embarrassed to see Da San, and Shuan Cheng was very busy with work, and he really didn't have time to find Da San. Da San saw that the situation was not right, thought to himself, could he also be a traitor? So he became silent again, not talking to anyone, doing everything without any interest or enthusiasm, just full of a belly of fire, and would get angry and violent if he didn't like a word.

　　At this time, the village had finished harvesting the autumn crops. Because of the drought this year, Black Rock Slope didn't have much land anyway, and in the last two years, the "soldier-farmer integration" system made people not want to work the land well. Although the poor had planted a little more land this time, the poor lacked manure and fertilizer, and the harvest was less than 30% of a normal year, so everyone had to tighten their belts for food and drink. Therefore, everyone was eager to find work. Ju Bao's two土窑(earth kilns/mines) in the village started up again, but they could only accommodate a dozen or twenty people. The west mouth of the Da Yao pit, although Tai Cheng, Niu Bao and others no longer dared to eat ash food, was still only being dug by them, without regulations, and others didn't dare to go down. Da San felt that this was too unfair. These days, he had also heard that Hua Da comrades in nearby villages were leading the establishment of many iron furnaces and coal kilns, and the mines in Yangquan were also being restored. He really couldn't hold back the stuffiness in his heart; so he went to find Shuan Cheng again.

　　黑石坡煤窑演义（３７）
　　康濯
  　　　　　三十四　憋闷
    老尹呆了七八天，村里认识的人慢慢多了，他却总不找玉宝；玉宝也不敢找他，只悄悄地把小铺关了门，他那委员会也再不作什么工作。但老尹也象是没干什么工作，他一天家光找些穷得要甚没甚的人，叫各人捣拉各人一辈子遭过的难受过的苦，不管是窑洞里黑屋里地里场里，半响半响地跟人歇着，你给他说完你的苦，他就紧打慢敲地和你品评：这苦是哪里来的呀？你为什么会受这苦呀？要怎么才能不受苦呀……真个是说得人人心眼出窃脑筋开，喜眉笑眼，浑身带劲；谁个要是心上的疙瘩一时说不明白，他会三回五回地跟你缠磨，直到你心地开朗才罢。就这么着，连天禄那样的人，也说得没事就光想寻老尹捣拉的，拴成更是没事就不离老尹。后来，妇女老婆们也喜爱寻老尹捣拉了，柳沟家是跟老尹说了半宿，一边说一边直哭鼻子；还有白泉家，她从解放后就和柳沟家住在一道，分了点果实，养种点地，成天不串门不说话，见了老尹就要躲起来的，现在，她见到柳沟家倒苦水哭鼻子，她不由的也啼哭起来，也说了话诉了苦。这么直闹得人人心眼活跳活跳地。
    只有大三跟别人不一样。有一回，老尹在扁小家里，叫大三说说他的苦，大三道：“我大半辈子窑底下受罪，别的种地、担扁担、讨吃要饭、挨冻受饿都经受过，说那些个管啥用！”老尹说：“那你说你是为什么受苦的？”大三道：“日本洋鬼、汉奸阎锡山跟财主们压迫的呗！”老尹又问：“依你说，咱要怎么才能不受苦？”大三道：“跟他妈那伙杂种家伙干呗！”“可怎么干啊？”“你华大领导呗！”老尹笑了，旁边扁小和拴成也笑了。一会，老尹慢慢给大三解说要诉苦翻心抱团体的一些个道理，大三倒也觉着对，可他又很不耐烦，总想着：这些好说嘛！先干不比什么也强！因此好多话就听一半忘一半，不怎么高兴。老尹也看出了他跟别人不同的这股劲，又从别人嘴里打问了他的身世，并去他家捣拉了两回，无意中老尹忽然听了大三还在日本窑上当过小把头，不禁吃了一惊！小把头，不是仗着日本势力，欺压剥削窑黑的汉奸腿子么？而且老尹觉得大三这人脾气太蹩扭，又多少带点流氓架势，平日穿戴也干干净净，嘴里镶着金牙，家里炕上铺盖齐全，桌上摆设着洋磁缸、牙刷、定南针和他在阳泉照的像片，这都不象个老实受苦人……老尹心中犯了猜疑，慢慢就不怎么结记他这人，把他暂时撂到一边了。
    以后，大三只见拴成天禄他们见天黑夜去扁小家里，半宿半宿的不知闹什么，却不叫他去，他憋闷得每天黑夜睡不着，总要等天禄回来问两句话，但天禄却记事记不周全，说话说不圆活，而且他每日干一天营生，大半宿回来，瞌睡的不行，大三也问不出个情由。问拴成吧，拴成这时劲头十足，他也知道大三正发闷，但他们这时刚成立了贫农组，有扁小、天禄、柳沟家、白泉家十来人，扁小和他当正副组长，他们每日黑夜开会，大伙约定过不许外传的，所以拴成对大三也总是吞吞吐吐；拴成也曾好几回想拉大三进贫农组，但老尹却说：“他停两天再说吧！”组里别人也都觉着他不比旁人，不能随便往进拉，拴成不同意吧也说不出个准道理，这么直闹得拴成也不大好意思见大三，并且拴成工作挺忙，也的确没什么工夫寻大三捣拉了。大三看出劲头不对，低头想想，觉着自己莫非也是汉奸么？他就又不声不响地，跟谁也不大说话，干什么也没心思没热气，只是满肚子闷火，半句话不对眼，就要跟人发火动武的。
    这时候，村里收罢了秋。今天天旱，黑石坡本又地土不多，这二年“兵农合一”又制的人们谁也不往好里作务地，虽说这会穷人多种了点地，但穷人是粪土也缺，收下还不够三成年景，谁家吃喝也要紧裤腰带，因此，谁也急着要找营生干。村里聚宝的两座土窑又动弹开了，但也下不了一二十人；大窑的西口窑坑，虽说泰成牛宝们再不敢吃灰食，却也还只是他们几个人刨，没规章，别人也不敢下。大三觉得这太不公平，这些时他又听说左近各村华大同志领导着闹起了不少铁炉和煤窑，阳泉的矿厂也大都在拾掇恢复，他实在别不住心里头的闷气；他就又找拴成去了。
