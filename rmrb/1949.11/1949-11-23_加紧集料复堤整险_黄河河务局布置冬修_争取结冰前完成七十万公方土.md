　　Intensify Collection of Materials for Embankment Restoration and Risk Mitigation
　　Yellow River Conservancy Commission Deploys Winter Repairs
    Striving to Complete 700,000 Cubic Meters of Earthwork Before Freezing
    [Our Dispatch] Pingyuan News: After the end of the autumn flood season, the Yellow River Conservancy Commission immediately began planning, deploying, and carrying out winter work. On the 3rd of this month, a joint meeting was convened in Batou Town, Puyang, with the directors of the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Repair and Defense Divisions, as well as the chiefs of various repair and defense sections, the director of the Stone Material Transportation Office, and the instructors of each waterway team, to discuss winter work. The meeting lasted three days. The plan includes embankment restoration, material collection, breach closure, cadre training, etc. The embankment restoration and material collection work will also take into account the problem of disaster relief. On the one hand, the winter work of the Yellow River can be completed, and on the other hand, disaster victims can obtain a large amount of grain through work relief. First, embankment restoration project: strive to complete 700,000 cubic meters of earthwork before freezing. The project steps and methods are to first widen the embankment, and then increase the height next year; restore where soil can be obtained first, and try not to build bridges (because most of the river-facing and back-facing surfaces of the Yellow River embankment have accumulated water). In order to take care of the disaster victims, the wages are still two catties of rice and two catties of firewood per cubic meter of earth, and the masses can get more than two million catties of rice in total. The entire project is expected to be completed in half a month with 20,000 people working every day. Second, material collection work: (1) Quarrying and transporting stone to repair dangerous sections of dams and groynes. In addition to public ships, civilian ships will transport more than 50,000 cubic meters of quarried stone to various repair and defense sections. It is stipulated that the freight rate is 30 catties of rice per 1,000 catties for 30 li. (2) Collect and transport 3 million catties of straw. (3) Purchase 400,000 catties of raw materials such as jute for dams, groynes, electric wires, and paint brushes, 50,000 catties of copper and lead wire, a large batch of rush bags and rush ropes, and 400 fir trees. Third, breach closure project: Continue to close the largest of the three breaches at Zhang Fuankou in Shou Zhang (two smaller ones have already been closed) to prevent ice floods and protect wheat seedlings. Fourth, continue planting willows along the embankment to consolidate the embankment and facilitate material acquisition during emergency repairs. This winter and next spring, a total of 1.47 million willow trees will be planted from Fengqiu downstream. The method of planting trees is public planting and public ownership. In addition to the responsibility of each repair and defense section, engineering team, and labor team, the method of protecting trees is to organize the masses along the embankment to guard them, giving them the income from pruning willows and harvesting embankment grass. Fifth, model selection and learning: Before the end of the year, each repair and defense division will conduct model selection, and in January next year, the River Conservancy Commission will hold a river-wide model commendation and summary conference. In December, in addition to the general rectification of cadre learning, engineering teams, sailors, and telephone operators will be trained in units of divisions. Sixth, clear the annual income and expenditure reports and prepare the next year's project budget.

　　加紧集料复堤整险
　　黄河河务局布置冬修
    争取结冰前完成七十万公方土
    【本报讯】平原消息：黄河河务局于秋汛期结束后，即开始计划布置与进行冬季工作，并于本月三日在濮阳坝头镇召集二、三、四修防处主任及各修防段段长、石料运输处处长、各水手大队教导员联席会议，研讨冬季工作。会议历时三天。计划中包括复堤、集料、堵口、训练干部等等。并在复堤、集料工作上兼顾解决灾民问题，一方面能完成黄河今冬工作，一方面以工代赈使灾民得到大批粮食。第一，复堤工程：争取于结冰前完成七十万公方土。工程步骤与方法，采取先加宽，明年再加高；那里能取土，即先复那里，尽量不塔桥（因黄堤的临、背河面大部有积水）。工资为照顾灾民，仍为每方土二斤米二斤柴，群众可共得米二百余万斤。全部工程以每日两万人计，半月可完成。第二，集料工作：（一）开石运石，以便整修各险工坝埽。开采的石料除公船运输外，由民船运到各修防段共约五万多方。规定每千斤三十里运费米三十斤。（二）集运秸料三百万斤。（三）采购坝埽、电线、油刷船只等之原料品大麻四十万斤。铜、铅丝五万斤，蒲包、蒲绳一大批，及杉木四百根。第三，堵口工程：继续堵死寿张张福安口门的最大一个（共三个，两个小的已堵死），以防凌汛，保住麦苗。第四，继续沿堤植柳工作，以巩固堤防与抢险时便于取材。今冬明春，从封邱以下共植柳一百四十七万株。植树办法是公植公有。护树办法除由各修防段、工程队、劳动大队负责外，并组织沿堤群众看守，给予以髡柳与收割堤草之收益。第五，选模与学习：年前各修防处进行选模，明年一月河务局召开全河表模总结大会。十二月份普遍整顿干部学习外，并以处为单位集训工程队、水手、电话员。第六，清理全年收支报消，准备下年工程预算。
