　　First District Workers, After a Month of Study,
　　Establish Internationalist Thought
　　First Night School Test Scores Average 70
　　[Reported by this newspaper] Since the six worker night schools of the First District Federation of Trade Unions began conducting internationalist education in October, most have completed the first and second parts of the material introducing the Soviet Union and major Asian and Australian countries, as well as the "Workers of the World are One Family" material. Worker study groups in factories such as Xinhua Rubber Factory and Gongmao Automobile Company have also completed their study of the introduction to the Soviet Union. At the end of October, the worker night schools also held a learning test centered on the topic of internationalist education, focusing on "Why are the workers of the world one family?", "The national character of the Soviet Union," "The significance of the October Revolution," and "The relationship between the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference and the Chinese working class."

　　Regarding the test scores, taking the First Night School as an example, 22 people participated in the test, with only 3 people scoring below 60, and the average score was 70. This shows that through this period of internationalist education, the workers have not only clarified their previous vague notions of the Soviet Union, distinguished between friends and enemies internationally, and understood the relationship between the working class in imperialist countries and the Chinese working class, but have also further developed new and correct internationalist thinking and understanding.

　　一区工人经过一月学习
    树立国际主义思想
  　第一夜校测验成绩平均七十分
    【本报讯】一区工会办事处六个工人夜校自十月份开展国际主义教育以来，大部已完成苏联介绍和亚澳主要国家介绍及“天下工人是一家”教材之第一、第二部份。新华橡胶厂、公懋汽车行等工厂工人学习组亦将苏联介绍学习完。工人夜校更于十月底举行了一次以国际主义教育为中心题目的学习测验，重点在“为什么天下工人是一家？”“苏联的国家性质”、“十月革命的意义”、“亚澳职工代表大会和我们中国工人阶级的关系”。
    测验成绩，以第一夜校来讲，参加测验人数二十二人，六十分以下者仅三人，平均分数为七十分。由这一点说明了经过这一段国际主义教育，工友们在思想上不单澄清了先前对苏联的模糊观念，分清了国际上的敌友，了解帝国主义国家内工人阶级和中国工人阶级的关系；而且进一步有了新的正确的国际主义的思想和认识。
