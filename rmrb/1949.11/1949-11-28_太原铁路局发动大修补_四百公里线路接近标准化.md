[Report from our correspondent in Shijiazhuang] The "Road Maintenance and Repair" campaign launched by the Taiyuan Railway Bureau on October 1st, covering the Shi (Jiazhuang) - De (xian) and Shi (Jiazhuang) - Tai (yuan) lines, has completed its first phase. The 420 kilometers of track on both lines are gradually approaching standardization. Tests have shown that the technical construction of many sections has reached over 60 kilometers per hour, exceeding the speed limit set by the Ministry of Railways by 5 kilometers.

The "Road Maintenance and Repair" campaign on both lines was launched under the unified leadership of the Taiyuan Railway Bureau and the Shijiazhuang Office. More than 50,000 workers, family members, people living along the lines, troops, and students were involved in this voluntary labor. Many workers' families carried their children to the tracks to help sift ballast. Troops and students launched competitions in their work, and some workers took out their own money to buy baskets to learn how to fill roadbeds. In this atmosphere, in just 45 days of work, a total of 55,439 cubic meters of roadbed was filled, and 130,000 sleepers were replaced. The entire line has been cleaned of roadbeds, separating ballast from soil. The cleaning work at seventeen stations from Shijiazhuang to Cangxian has been strengthened, and everything is gradually approaching standardization, which has laid a solid foundation for completing the heavy winter transportation tasks. Currently, the second phase of complete standardization and regularization repair is underway. Two thousand students from Shijiazhuang have also joined the effort.

　　太原铁路局发动大修补
  　四百公里线路接近标准化
    【本报石家庄专电】自十月一日开始的太原铁路局所属石（家庄）德（县）、石（家庄）太（原）线“养路大补修”运动，现已完成第一阶段工程，两线四百二十公里的线路逐渐接近标准化。经试验，运行结果，不少区间技术建设已达六十公里以上，较铁道部订行车时速，超过五公里。
    两线“养路大补修”运动是在太原路局和石家庄办事处统一领导下展开的，各区职工、家属，以及沿线民众、驻军、学生共五万多人，都卷进了这个义务劳动。不少职工家属背着孩子到线路上来帮助筛石碴，部队和学生们在工作中展开了竞赛，有的工友掏出自己的钱来买筐学填路基。在这样的情绪中，只经过四十五天的工作，共填补了五万五千四百三十九立方公尺的路基，抽换枕木十三万根。全线都清洁了道床，使石碴和泥土分开。从石家庄到沧县十七个站台已加强清扫工作，一切逐渐接近标准化，这对完成繁重的冬季运输任务，已打下雄厚的基础。目前，两线正热烈进行第二阶段的完全标准化和正规化的补修。石家庄全市两千个学生也加入了这个工作。
