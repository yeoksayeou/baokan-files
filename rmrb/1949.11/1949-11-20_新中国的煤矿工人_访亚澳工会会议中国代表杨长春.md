　　New China's Coal Miners
　　——An Interview with Yang Changchun, Chinese Delegate to the Asian-Australasian Trade Union Conference
　　Bai Sheng
　　Today, as the Asian-Australasian Trade Union Conference triumphantly opens in the capital, Beijing, I, as a reporter, with unparalleled excitement visited one of our country's coal mine trade union representatives attending the conference, Yang Changchun, Chairman of the Northeast Coal Miners' General Union. This outstanding worker-cadre, who once worked in technical roles for ten years, shared with us many stories about the liberation of the Northeast coal mine trade unions and coal miners in the New China.

　　His narration unfolded like a story.

　　In the mountainous Northeast, during the long years under Japanese imperialist rule, the Northeast's mines were transformed into colonial mines. During those years, Japanese plutocrats, in order to extract exorbitant profits, implemented a savage "ba tou" (foreman) contracting system and a system of supervision by police, special agents, and labor service personnel (external staff). Under such profound oppression and exploitation, miners could not secure even the basic necessities of life and teetered on the brink of starvation and death. In the gloomy coal pits, many miners could only wear crude burlap sacks used for carrying rice, eat acorn flour or soybean cakes, and sleep naked on cold earthen beds. Some of these miners were laborers seized from various places, while others were peasants from within the passes deceived and recruited by the "ba tou." They were often brought to the mines by trains under the direction of Japanese invaders' mine "ba tou," then fenced in with electric fences and forced to work. To prevent them from escaping, they even shaved off their eyebrows. The mortality rate among miners there was extremely high. Even workers suffering from serious illnesses who could still be saved were often forcibly carried out and placed in warehouses for the dead. "Ten-thousand-man pits" and "human refining furnaces" were cruel facilities present in almost every coal mine during the Japanese-controlled puppet Manchukuo era. They did not treat miners as human beings; when a miner died, they were thrown into the pit. Some Japanese rulers and bad "ba tou" even burned the dead workers to extract oil and sell it back to the miners to eat. These miserable miners, treated as slaves, endured these days filled with indignation and grief. They bravely resisted and struggled, universally resorting to slowdowns and loading stones or running empty cars during "mass coal production" to practice passive resistance.

　　On August 15th, the heroic Soviet Red Army and the Eighth Route Army from within the passes liberated the Northeast, and coal miners were freed from imperialist oppression. However, the Kuomintang bandit gangs unreasonably occupied the Northeast, and the South Manchuria coal mines reverted to the same gloomy and terrifying conditions as in the puppet Manchukuo era.

　　It was not until the complete liberation of the Northeast and the democratic government taking over the mines that coal miners were finally transformed from slaves into masters. At the same time, thanks to the leadership of the Communist Party and the education of the trade unions, their class consciousness quickly increased, and they began to recognize their own strength and the truth that labor creates the world.

　　Currently, under the leadership of the Northeast Coal Miners' General Union, there are 140,000 coal mine workers and 18 state-owned and provincial-owned coal mine areas in the entire Northeast. The largest include Fushun, Benxi, Fuxin, Beipiao, and Tonghua in South Manchuria, and Jixi, Hegang, Xi'an, and Jiaohe in North Manchuria, all of which are renowned coal mining areas in China. The total number of Northeast coal miners participating in trade unions has reached 93,455, accounting for over 66% of all employees. Trade union organizations are gradually being established and expanded, with the Northeast Coal Miners' General Union, mine area unions, mine unions, pit unions, and trade union groups developing work at each level. Under the leadership of their own organization, the trade union, and the administrative leadership of each mining area, workers have guaranteed the forward development of production. The living standards of miners are constantly being improved and raised, and for the first time in China, miners have received labor insurance. Welfare services for miners, such as mine hospitals, medical clinics, sanatoriums, schools for workers' children, nursing homes, cooperatives, clubs, cinemas, canteens, bathhouses, and other facilities, are also being gradually established in various mining areas. In terms of cultural education, miners' schools, libraries, theaters, and cultural work troupes have been established, and workers have even written their own plays such as "Tears of the Mine" and "Turning Scrap Iron into Steel." At the same time, trade unions have proposed formal education during spare time to improve workers' political, cultural, and technical levels. Some miners have entered specialized schools or workers' political universities run by the government. Because the mines are far from cities, these cultural and recreational activities are warmly welcomed by miners and have become an essential part of their lives.

　　Under the leadership of the trade union, the Northeast coal miners actively restored the mining areas destroyed by the enemy and successively launched movements to protect the mines, democratic movements, and movements to contribute equipment. They also carried out movements to restore production and construction, support production for the front lines, achieve meritorious service through production, and launch labor emulation campaigns. In each movement, many labor heroes and meritorious model workers have emerged. Miners who were oppressed and despised for many years now proudly raise their heads. Trade unions have cultivated a large number of trade union cadres, and 5,176 outstanding workers have assumed important positions such as mine directors, factory directors, pit chiefs, and section chiefs. Miners have not only become the masters of the mines but have also become mine leaders. For example, Sun Haoqing and Cui Jisao from Hegang Coal Mine, and Zhang Jintang from Jixi Coal Mine, have all become mine directors from being labor heroes. Today, they can lead 2,000 to 4,000 coal miners to actively complete production tasks. Under the leadership of the trade union, miners have brought into play the collective creativity of workers and staff, which proves that miners are capable of managing their own mines. At present, the production efficiency of the eight major state-owned mining areas in the Northeast has increased to an average of 0.473 tons, exceeding past productivity. Currently, workers are conducting four-fixed management (fixed personnel, fixed quantity, fixed materials, fixed quality) and researching improvements to the short-lived Japanese coal mining methods to lay a foundation for long-term construction. The Northeast coal miners are enthusiastically launching anti-waste and new record creation movements to further increase production, implement economic accounting, and reduce costs.

　　When the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the Northeast General Trade Union issued the notice that the Asian-Australasian Trade Union Conference would be held in China, the Northeast workers were overjoyed and encouraged. They will celebrate the opening of the conference by completing their production plans ahead of schedule. They know that only under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao can the Chinese working class be liberated, and only then can everyone have today and truly host international worker leaders in their own country to hold this victorious and united conference. They are enthusiastically arranging and preparing to welcome delegates from various countries to visit the mining areas. At the same time, they will sincerely learn from these international worker leaders, especially the construction experience and trade union work of the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries. Because the cultural and technical level of mine workers is still low, mine management experience is insufficient, and the miner casualty rate should still be reduced. They hope to receive valuable opinions and experiences from various countries to improve their work.

　　Finally, Comrade Yang Changchun happily stated that the convening of this Asian-Australasian Trade Union Conference will enhance the international status of Chinese coal miners. In the near future, Chinese coal miners will also join the world coal mine industry trade union. At the same time, after this Asian-Australasian Trade Union Conference, he believes that it will further unite the coal miners of Asia and Australasia and establish their own unified organization. It will also further promote the establishment of a national unified organization for our Chinese coal miners. Speaking here, Comrade Yang Changchun said even more excitedly that he himself is a worker, and this time he can represent the Northeast coal miners in the capital of the New China to participate in this grand international worker solidarity conference. He feels infinitely honored and excited, and it is also a very good opportunity for learning. (Attached picture)

　　新中国的煤矿工人
    ——访亚澳工会会议中国代表杨长春
    柏生
    亚澳工会会议胜利地在首都北京揭幕的今天，记者带着无比的兴奋去访问了我国出席大会的一位煤矿工会代表，——东北煤矿总工会主席杨长春。这位曾经做过十年技术工作的工人优秀干部，他介绍给我们不少关于新中国东北煤矿工会与煤矿工人的翻身事迹。
    他的谈话象叙述故事一样。
    在那矿山重重的东北，曾经为日本帝国主义者统治的那些漫长的年月里，东北的矿山也曾变成了殖民地的矿山。那些年月，日本的财阀们为了榨取超额的利润，竟在这里实施着野蛮的“把头”包工制和警、特、劳务（系外勤人员）的监工制。矿工们在这样深重的压迫剥削下，终日不得温饱，生活濒于饥饿死亡的绝境。在阴森的煤坑里，许多矿工只能穿着一个装米用的粗麻袋，吃着橡子面或豆饼，光身睡在冰冷的土炕上。这些矿工有的是从各地抓来的劳工，也有被“把头”欺骗招来的关内农民，他们多是被日寇所指使的矿山“把头”用火车拉上矿山，然后用电网封锁起来，强迫劳动。因为害怕他们逃跑，甚至把他们的眉毛也剃掉了。在那里，矿工的死亡率非常高，害着重病还可以挽救的工人，也常常被强迫抬出去放到死人的仓库里。“万人坑”“炼人炉”是日本人统治下的伪满时代，几乎每一个煤矿都有的一种残酷的设备。他们不把矿工当人看，矿工死了便往坑里扔，有些日本统治者与坏的“把头”还把死去的工人烧了炼出油来卖给矿工吃。这些阴惨的被当作奴隶的矿工们，就在这充满敌忾的悲愤的日子里煎熬着。他们英勇地反抗着斗争着，他们普遍地用磨洋工和在“大出炭”时装石头、跑空车的办法，实行消极抵抗。
    “八一五”苏联英勇红军与关内八路军解放东北，煤矿工人从帝国主义压迫下解放出来；但国民党匪帮无理强占东北，南满煤矿又恢复到和伪满时代一样，过着阴森可怕的日子。
    直到东北全部解放，民主政府接收矿山的时候，煤矿工人最后地由奴隶变成了主人。同时因为受到共产党的领导与职工会的教育，他们的阶级觉悟很快提高，开始认识了自己的力量，同时也意识到劳动创造世界的真理。
    目前在东北煤矿总工会的领导下，全东北共有十四万煤矿职工，有十八个国营及省营煤矿区。最大的如南满的抚顺、本溪、阜新、北票、通化，北满的鸡西、鹤岗、西安、蛟河，这些都是中国著名的煤矿开采区。参加职工会的东北煤矿工人总数已达到九万三千四百五十五人，占全体职工的百分之六十六强。工会组织逐渐建立扩大起来，由东北煤矿总工会、矿区工会、矿工会、坑工会、工会小组等逐层展开工作。工人们在自己的组织职工会和各矿区的行政领导下，保证了生产的向前发展。矿工们的生活不断得到改善、提高，而且在中国矿工们第一次得到了劳动保险。矿工们的福利工作如矿山医院、医疗所、疗养院、工人子弟学校、养老院、合作社、俱乐部、电影院、食堂、澡堂等设备也都在各个矿区逐渐建立了起来。在文化教育上，设立了矿山工人学校、图书馆、剧团、文工团等，工人们更自己编写了“矿山泪”“废铁炼成钢”等剧本。同时工会里提出了工余时间的正规教育，提高工人的政治文化和技术水平。有的矿工进了政府办的专门学校或工人政治大学。由于矿山离城市较远，这些文化娱乐活动，都受到矿工们的热烈欢迎，并且已成为他们生活中必须的一部分。
    在职工会的领导下，东北的煤矿工人积极地恢复了敌人破坏的矿区，并先后展开了护矿运动、民主运动、献纳器材运动等。在进行恢复生产建设、生产支前、生产立功、劳模竞赛。每一次运动中，都涌现出了许多劳动英雄和立功模范。常年受压迫的被卑视的矿工们，今天光荣地抬起了头。工会里培养了大批的职工干部，优秀的职工担任了矿长、厂长、坑长、股长等重要职务的，已有五千一百七十六人。矿工不仅做了矿山的主人，而且已成为矿山领导者。如鹤岗煤矿的工人孙好清、崔继绍，鸡西煤矿的工人张金堂，都由劳动英雄当了煤矿的矿长。他们今天已能领导着二千到四千的煤矿工人积极完成生产任务。矿工们在工会领导下，发挥了工人与职员集体的创造性，这证明了矿工是有能力管理自己的矿山的。目前，东北国营八大矿区的生产能率，平均已提高到○、四七三吨，已经超过过去的生产力，目前工人并进行四定管理（定员、定量、定材、定质），研究改进日本短命采煤方法。打下长期建设基础。东北的煤矿工人，正在热烈地展开着反浪费与创造新纪录运动，更进一步提高生产实行经济核算、降低成本。
    当全总与东北总工会发下亚澳工会会议在中国召开的通知后，东北工人都欢腾鼓舞起来。他们将以提早完成生产计划来庆祝大会的开幕。他们知道只有在中国共产党、毛主席领导下，中国工人阶级才能翻身，大家才有今天、才能真正在自己的国家里招待国际的工人领袖们，开这个胜利团结的大会。他们正在热烈地布置和准备迎接各国代表前往矿区参观。同时并将诚恳地向这些国际工人的领袖们虚心学习，特别是苏联及新民主主义国家的建设经验与职工会工作。因为矿山工人们文化技术水平还低，矿山管理经验不够，矿工伤亡率还应减少。这些缺点，他们希望接受各国宝贵的意见与经验来改进工作。
    最后杨长春同志愉快地表示，这次亚澳工会会议的召开，将会使中国的煤矿工人国际地位提高。不久的将来，中国的煤矿工人也将参加到世界煤矿产业工会中去，同时在这次亚澳工会会议后，他相信一定会使亚澳两洲的煤矿工人也进一步的团结起来，建立自己统一的组织。同时也更会推动我们中国煤矿工人建立全国统一组织。说到这里，杨长春同志更兴奋的说，他自己是一个工人，这次又能代表着东北煤矿工人在新中国人民首都参加这盛大的国际工人团结的大会，自己感到无限的光荣和兴奋，同时也是一个很好的学习。（附图片）
