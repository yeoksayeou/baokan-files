　　The Greater Khingan Range Forest and its Logging Operations
　　By Our Correspondent in Inner Mongolia, Ai Fang
　　In Inner Mongolia's industrial production plan for 1950, forestry production is given top priority. This is because Inner Mongolia possesses the world-renowned Greater Khingan Range forest, which is abundant in timber reserves, of good quality, and has a considerable logging base, urgently needed for the current national economic construction.

　　　　Forest Overview
　　The Greater Khingan Range stretches from the Tao'er River basin in the south to the Heilongjiang River bank in the north, from the Ergun River in the west to the Nenjiang River in the east. It crosses the China Changchun Railway from southwest to northeast, extending for two thousand li, covered with dense forests. According to a survey during the Japanese puppet Manchukuo period, the forest area was 9,139,300 hectares (every 100 hectares is one square kilometer), mainly distributed in the Three Rivers, Huiyinggele, Yakeshi, Molidawa Banner, Qalandun to Boketu's Choer forest area of the Hulunbuir-Nawen Muren League in Inner Mongolia and the Arxan area of the Xing'an League. The forest area accounts for about six percent of the total area of 1.5 million square kilometers in Inner Mongolia; the forest stock volume is 986,035,500 cubic meters, accounting for more than one-third of the total timber stock volume of 2.6 billion cubic meters in Northeast China.
　　The Greater Khingan Range is 2,000 meters above sea level, with an average annual temperature below zero degrees Celsius, and an annual rainfall of 400 to 500 mm, suitable for the growth of arbors. However, due to the severe cold climate, the growing season is in summer, and the main tree species is larch (Yiqi pine), accounting for about 70% of the total forest; followed by birch, with a small amount of poplar, oak, elm, red pine, etc. Larch is strong and dense, oily, and corrosion-resistant, making it a good material for sleepers and utility poles.

　　　　Past and Present of Logging Operations
　　The logging of the Greater Khingan Range forest began in 1898 when Imperial Russia built the Chinese Eastern Railway, and has a history of fifty years to date. At that time, a large number of sleepers were needed, so logging operations were carried out on both sides of the railway, and Russian merchants also engaged in logging. The Manchu Qing government specially established a Timber Company to collect mountain share money. Later, with the emergence of timber companies in various parts of eastern Manchuria, the Chinese Eastern Railway organized the Zamian Timber Company in 1922, with operations in the Zhadun River and Miandu River basins in the western part of the Greater Khingan Range. In 1927, the Haimin Timber Company was also established, with operations in the area from the Hailar River to the Yimin River basin.
　　The forest area of the Greater Khingan Range was once a source of mountain share money and embezzlement for the Manchu Qing government and later warlords. They only knew how to cut down trees indiscriminately, not how to cultivate forests. All the so-called "Forestry Policy Outline" and "Forest Law" were just empty words and window dressing.
　　After the "September 18th" Incident, in order to plunder in large quantities, Japanese imperialism strengthened investigation and statistics, and strengthened the administrative organs for plunder, successively establishing the Forestry Department of the Puppet Ministry of Industry (under the jurisdiction of the Forest Office of the Puppet Forestry Agency), the Forestry Department, Forestry Administration, Forestry Office, and Forestry Bureau of the puppet provinces. They also set up so-called "Labor Service" teams, forcing a large number of young people to go to the forest to serve them without compensation. The workers' lives were even more miserable. Under the layers of exploitation by the enemy's puppet military police, special agents, large foremen, and second foremen, they worked hard, eating acorn noodles and wearing clothes like sacks.
　　Under the duress of the enemy's bayonets, the number of forestry workers in Inner Mongolia once reached 10,000, using more than 17,000 head of livestock. The enemy also had the Bolin and Yalin forest railways, as well as four sawmills. At that time, the enemy's logging volume in the Greater Khingan Range has not yet obtained accurate and comprehensive data. According to the statistics of the puppet Xing'an East Province alone, the output in 1936 was 51,000 cubic meters, and in 1937 it was 234,000 cubic meters, accounting for more than 11% of the total timber output of 2,094,200 cubic meters in the puppet Manchukuo at that time.
　　After the "August 15th" Victory, with the liberation of the entire Northeast and Inner Mongolia, the forestry workers of the Greater Khingan Range also gained a new life, and from then on, their productivity could be fully发挥发挥. Over the past few years, under the leadership of the autonomous government and the hard work of the workers, considerable achievements have been made in production, and the lives of the workers have been initially improved.
　　At present, Inner Mongolia's forest logging operations are divided into four forest areas: Arxan, Choer, Bayan, and Yakeshi, according to terrain, transportation, and administrative management conditions. Under the leadership of the Inner Mongolia Forestry General Bureau, each forest area has sub-bureaus and operation stations, with a total of more than 200 cadres. The number of workers during the winter logging season can reach 7,000, and including the China Changchun Railway logging workers, it should be over 10,000. There are currently 125 kilometers of the Bolin forest railway (jointly used by Inner Mongolia and China Changchun Railway logging), 143 kilometers of the Yalin railway (used by China Changchun Railway), and 35 kilometers of the Wuyigou light forest railway. In terms of waterway transportation, the Nenjiang River, Heilongjiang River, Hailar River, Teer River, and Halaha River can be used. Through the efforts of all workers and staff, 100,000 cubic meters of old timber were sorted and moved out from 1946 to 1947; in 1948, 89,584 cubic meters of timber were logged and 53,959 cubic meters of timber were moved out; 10,000 ping of firewood were logged and 10,000 ping of firewood were moved out; it is estimated that 276,761 cubic meters of logging tasks will be completed in 1949; and 411,000 cubic meters are planned for logging next year. In recent years, the annual production has increased by about one time compared with the previous year. This year's production has reached the level of the puppet Xing'an East Province in 1937.
　　The winter logging season in various forest areas is about to begin, and the preparatory work has been largely completed, such as repairing rivers, dams, ice roads and mountain roads, collecting sheep grass, and mobilizing vehicles and horses. In early November, more than 2,000 strong carts with strong horses and men poured into the mountains.

　　　　Several Problems to be Solved Urgently in the Current Work
　　(1) Do a good job in fire prevention and forest cultivation. This spring, in April and May, there were 20 forest fires in various places, burning more than 2.7 million hectares of forest. After the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government conducted education among cadres and established mass fire prevention organizations in the forest areas, although there has been great progress, since the beginning of autumn, forest fires have continued to occur in various places, fortunately, no major disasters have been caused. It is urgently needed to conduct fire prevention education among cadres and the masses, strengthen the sense of responsibility for cherishing national assets, combine various necessary fire prevention organizational work, and carry out mass fire prevention campaigns.
　　(2) Oppose waste and corruption, and implement economic accounting. At present, there are many waste phenomena in various places. For example, the stumps left after tree felling are generally around one meter high. In addition to the logs that meet the specifications, the tree heads that are cut off are enough for a sleeper material, or other materials, but no one sorts them out. In management, due to improper use of personnel in certain links, incidents of corruption and waste have occurred. For example, three group leaders in a certain place who had been fatheads in the past and had not been reformed, deceived and concealed, and used public funds to do business, embezzling as much as 5 million yuan (300 million Inner Mongolia currency). These waste phenomena should be promptly checked and corrected, and accurate calculations should be made to reduce costs and accumulate capital.
　　(3) Rationally adjust wages and maximize the effectiveness of wages. At present, wages are piece-rate wages. The ratios of various piece-rate wages are generally not a problem, but the general wages are too high, which is one of the main reasons why costs cannot be reduced. A sleeper-cutting worker can cut nine sleepers a day (some cut 30 or 40, and some cut two or three). Each sleeper is paid one point five (in recent months, the salary price for each point is more than 9,000 Inner Mongolia currency). On average, they earn more than 13 points a day. Calculated on the basis of working 25 days a month, they can earn 320 to 330 points. This is equivalent to nearly 1,000 catties of millet locally (local millet price: about 3,000 Inner Mongolia currency per catty). Each cart can pull about one cubic meter of timber a day, and each cubic meter of timber can earn more than 35 points (330,000 Inner Mongolia currency). Even if the average income of each cart is calculated as 30 points per day, they can earn about 800 points a month for 25 days of work (according to the new wage standard for forestry workers in Northeast China, it is 7 points per person and 9 points per horse per day. At present, Inner Mongolia forestry workers are 70% to 80% higher than this standard). Workers reflect: the more they earn, the more they spend. This on the one hand shows that the workers themselves do not manage their lives well, and a lot of money is wasted; on the other hand, it also shows that the workers' welfare and labor insurance have not been established or have not been implemented conscientiously, and the cooperatives have not been run well, so they cannot solve the problem of the workers' daily necessities, thus failing to make such high wages play a good role. In the rational adjustment of wages, it should not be a simple reduction of wages, but must be combined with the welfare undertakings of the workers to run the cooperatives conscientiously. This is beneficial to both the public and private.
　　(4) Strengthen the work of trade unions. The work of trade unions in the Greater Khingan Range has just begun. Some operation stations have established formal trade unions, and some are still preparatory committees. It is necessary to absorb a large number of members. For example, there are more than 1,000 old workers in the Choer forest area, but only more than 40 members, which is far from organizing all the workers. It is necessary to widely carry out propaganda and education among the workers, and gradually organize the workers to lead them in learning and production.
　　(5) Establish a democratic and scientific management institution. At present, no democratic production management institutions with the participation of worker representatives have been established in various operation stations. It is necessary to study the experience of establishing factory management committees in various places, carry out a democratic movement, the leadership should be good at absorbing the correct opinions of the masses, settle the backlog of past problems, improve unreasonable phenomena in the work, and establish a democratic and scientific management institution to ensure the completion of the great production tasks.

　　大兴安岭森林及其采伐作业
    本报驻内蒙记者  艾方
    一九五○年内蒙的工业生产计划中，把林业生产列入首要的地位。这是由于内蒙拥有世界闻名的大兴安岭大森林，木材含量既丰，质量又好，且有相当采伐基础，为目前国家经济建设所急需。
    　　　　森林概貌
    大兴安岭，南起洮尔河流域，北至黑龙江沿岸，西起额尔古纳河，东达嫩江，由西南而东北，横断中长路，绵延达两千华里，遍地为茂密的森林所遮盖。据伪满时的调查，森林面积为九百一十三万九千三百垧（每百垧为一平方公里），主要分布于内蒙呼伦贝尔纳文慕仁盟的三河、辉音果勒、牙克石、莫力达瓦旗、札兰屯至博克图之绰尔林区及兴安盟的阿尔山一带。林区约占内蒙全部面积一百五十万平方公里的百分之六；森林蓄积量为九亿八千六百零三万五千五百立方米，占全东北木材积蓄量二十六亿立方米的三分之一强。
    大兴安岭高出海面二千公尺，全年平均气温在零度以下，每年降雨量为四百至五百＠，适于乔木生长。但因气候严寒，生长期为夏季，树种主要为落叶松（义气松），约占全林的百分之七十；其次为白桦树，并有少量杨树、柞树、榆树、赤松等。落叶松质坚密，油性大，耐腐蚀，是作枕木、电柱用的好材料。
    　　　　采伐作业的过去和现在
    大兴安岭森林的采伐，开始于一八九八年帝俄修筑中东铁路的时候，到现在已有五十年的历史。当时需要大量枕木，即在铁路两侧进行采伐作业，同时亦有俄商采伐。满清政府专门设立了木植公司，征收山份金。以后，伴随东满各处采木公司的产生，中东铁路于一九二二年组织了扎免采木公司，作业地区在大兴安岭西部扎敦河及免渡河流域。一九二七年又曾创办海敏采木公司，作业地区是海拉尔河以上至伊敏河流域。
    大兴安岭的森林区，曾经成为满清政府和以后的军阀们征收山份金、贪污肥己的出处。他们只知滥伐，不知育林，一切所谓“林政要纲”、“森林法”等，都是一纸空文和装璜门面的幌子。
    “九一八”后，日本帝国主义为了大量掠夺，曾经加强调查统计，加强掠夺的行政机构，先后设伪实业部林务司（管辖伪营林机关之森林事务所），伪各省林务司、林务署、营林署、营林局等。又设所谓“勤劳奉仕”队，强迫大批青年到森林去，无代价地为其服务。工人们生活更苦，在敌伪宪兵、警特，以及大柜、二柜、把头层层剥削下，苦苦工作，而吃的是橡子面，穿的是麻袋一样的衣服。
    在敌人的刺刀威逼下，内蒙林业工人最多时到过一万人，使用一万七千多头牲口。敌人并设有森林铁道博林线及牙林线，还有火锯厂四处。当时敌人在大兴安岭的采伐量，目前尚未获得确实全面的材料，仅据伪兴安东省的统计，一九三六年该地的产量是五万一千立方米，一九三七年是二十三万四千立方米，占当时伪满全部木材产量二百零九万四千二百立方米的百分之十一强。
    “八一五”后，随着整个东北及内蒙的解放，大兴安岭的林业工人也获得了新生，从此生产力可以充分发挥了。几年来在自治政府的领导和工人的艰苦努力下，生产已获得相当成绩，并初步改善了工人的生活。
    现在内蒙森林的采伐作业，根据地形、运输、行政管理等条件，分为阿尔山、绰尔、巴彦、牙克石等四个林区。在内蒙林务总局领导下，各林区均设有分局及作业所，共有干部二百余名，工人冬季采伐期可达七千人，连中长路采伐工人，当在万人以上。现有森林铁道博林线一百二十五公里（内蒙与中长采伐共同利用），牙林线一百四十三公里（中长利用），轻便森林铁道五义沟线三十五公里。在水运方面，可利用嫩江、黑龙江、海拉尔河、体尔河、哈尔哈河等。经全体工人职员的努力，一九四六至一九四七年整理搬出旧材十万立方米；一九四八年采伐木材八万九千五百八十四立方米，搬出木材五万三千九百五十九立方米；采伐薪材一万坪，搬出薪材一万坪；一九四九年可完成采伐二十七万六千七百六十一立方米的任务；明年计划采伐四十一万一千立方米。几年来，每年的生产均较前提高一倍左右。今年的生产量已达伪兴安东省一九三七年的水平。
    现在各林区的冬季采伐即将开始，各项准备工作已大体完成，如修河、整坝、修冰道和山道，打羊草、动员车马等。十一月初，已有两千多辆人强马壮的大车源源入山。
    　　　　当前工作中急待解决的几个问题
    （一）做好防火育林的工作。今春四、五月间，各地曾发生山火二十次，烧林二百七十余万垧，经内蒙自治政府在干部中进行教育，在林区建立了群众防火的组织后，目前虽有很大进步，但入秋以来，各地续有山火发生，幸未酿成巨灾，急需经常在干部、群众中进行防火教育，加强爱护国家资财的责任心，结合各种必要的防火组织工作，开展群众性的防火运动。
    （二）反对浪费贪污，贯彻执行经济核算。现在各地浪费现象很多。如伐树留的楂子普遍在一米上下。很多树除出按规格要求的元木外，截下的树头还够一根枕木材料，或够其他材料，大都没人整理。在管理上，由于某些环节用人不当，曾发生贪污浪费的事件。如某地过去当过肥头而没有改造的三个小组长，上欺下瞒，明亏暗吃，使用公款做生意，贪污数达五百万元（三亿元内蒙币）。这些浪费现象应迅速加以检查纠正，并进行精密计算，以减低成本，积累资本。
    （三）合理调整工资，发挥工资最大的效能。目前工资是计件工资，各种计件工资比例一般没有什么问题，但普遍的工资过高，这是成本不能减低的主要原因之一。一个砍枕木工人以每天砍九根枕木计算（多的砍三、四十根，少的两三根），每根一分五（近几个月工薪价格每分均为内蒙币九千多元），一天平均得十三分多，每月以做二十五天工计，可得三百二、三十分。折合当地小米近千斤（当地米价：内蒙币三千元左右一斤）每天每辆车可拉一立米木材左右，每拉一立米木材可得三十五分多（三十三万内蒙币）即以平均每一个车一天收入三十分计算，每月做二十五天的工，可收入八百分左右（按东北林业工人新的工资标准，是每日人七分马九分，目前内蒙林业工人比这个标准高出百分之七、八十）。工人们反映：挣的多，化的多。这一方面说明了工人自己对生活管理不好，很多钱浪费了；一方面也说明了工人的福利、劳保尚未建立或未认真实行，合作社未办好，解决不了工人日用必需品的问题，因之使这样高的工资未能很好发挥效能。在合理调整工资中，不应是单纯的降低工资，而必须结合工人福利事业认真办好合作社。这样对公私都有好处。
    （四）加强工会工作。大兴安岭林业工会工作刚刚开始，各作业所，有的已建立正式工会，有的还是筹备会，需要大量吸收会员，如绰尔林区现在一千多老工人，只有四十多个会员，这离组织全体工人差的还很远，应广泛向工人进行宣传教育，逐渐把工人组织起来，领导他们学习、生产。
    （五）建立民主科学的管理机构。目前各作业所尚未建立有工人代表参加的民主的生产管理机构，应研究各地建立工厂管理委员会的经验，开展一个民主运动，领导上要善于吸收群众的正确意见，清算过去积压的问题，改进工作中的不合理现象，建立起民主科学的管理机构，以保证伟大的生产任务的完成。
