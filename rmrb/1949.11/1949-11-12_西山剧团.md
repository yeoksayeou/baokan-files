    "Xishan Theater Troupe"
    Pu Siwen
    The Xishan Coal Mine Amateur Theater Troupe, or Xishan Theater Troupe for short, was established on March 12th of this year together with the mine's labor union. It is under the leadership of the union's propaganda and education department. The troupe has more than forty members, including children as young as fourteen or fifteen and elderly people in their fifties or sixties. Everyone is united and gets along very well, never arguing over roles or quarreling. They are all excellent in production and active in learning. They have performed more than twenty plays, all of which they wrote themselves. In the beginning, they also rehearsed other people's plays, such as "People's City." However, because the work was scattered and it was difficult for everyone to get together, and also because there were few literate people and they couldn't memorize the lines, it didn't work out. From then on, they started writing and performing their own material. They have tried many different forms: Yangko dance dramas, spoken dramas, as well as comic dialogues, duets, and short songs. The content of these different forms is all combined with the central work of the labor union at each stage, or reflects the problems of the mine at that time. As far as I know, there are "Purple Stone English," "New CPPCC," "Three Enemies and Four Friends" (also called "White Paper"), "Correct Learning Attitude," "The Uncoupled Locomotive" (which tells the story of a workmate who became detached from the masses after training and was transformed), "Two Sesame Cakes" (the situation of coal kiln workers who were exploited and oppressed), "Ten Thousand Evils of the Landlord," "Model Family," and so on.

    Another type of performance is to directly convey the factory's orders and calls through cultural and recreational activities. Because the work in the mine is scattered, it is very difficult to convene a mass meeting. Therefore, the troupe came up with a "brilliant idea" – to perform plays. As soon as the news spread, everyone arrived, even more than you wanted to find. So, they turned the content they wanted to convey into songs, plays, or quick rhythmic talk shows and duets. Unconsciously, everyone understood the matters. At first, everyone didn't understand the purpose of their plays, but later they understood. However, everyone still liked to come and were even more enthusiastic, because they understood that they were serving the workers. The things the troupe said were exactly what they wanted to hear, and exactly what they wanted to say. Gradually, they loved this troupe even more. They offered opinions, and the troupe accepted the opinions and constantly corrected itself. Moreover, the troupe didn't close its doors and became a mass organization, and workers could participate at any time. In this way, the troupe gradually formed its own mass organization.

    “西山剧团”
    濮思温
    西山煤矿业余剧团，简称西山剧团。是今年三月十二日同该矿工会一起成立的，受工会宣教部的领导，全团有四十多人，有十四五的小孩子，也有五六十的老头，大家团结的很好，从不争角色，也从不吵架。在生产上他们都是好样的，学习上也积极。他们曾经演过二十几个戏，都是自己编的。在开始时，也曾排过别人的剧本“人民城市”。可是因为工作分散，大伙不易凑，再说认字人少，台词背不下来，结果没排成，从此就自编自唱起来。他们弄过的花样很多：有秧歌剧、有话剧，也有相声、双簧和小唱。这些不同形式的内容全都是结合着工会每个时期的中心工作，或反映当时矿上的问题。就我所知的有“紫石英号”，“新政协”，“三敌四友”，（又叫“白皮书”），“正确的学习态度”，“脱了钩的火车头”（是说受训回来的工友脱离群众被改造了的故事），“两个烧饼”（是煤窑工曾受剥削压迫的情状），“万恶地主”，“模范家庭”等等。
    再有一种演出，是直接通过文娱活动来传达厂方的命令和号召。因为矿上工作分散，召集个群众大会，非常困难，于是剧团想出来个“高招”——演戏。信一传出去，人全到了，比你想要找的还多。于是把想传达的内容，编成歌、排成戏或是作成快板双簧。大家不知不觉，把事情都明白了。起初大家都不明白他们演戏的目的，后来知道了，可是大家还是喜欢来，而且更踊跃，因为大家懂得他们是为工友们服务，剧团说出的事正是他们要听的、也正是他们想说的，渐渐的他们更爱护这个剧团了。有意见就提；剧团接受意见后不断修正自己，而且，剧团不关门，成为群众性的组织，工友们随时都可以参加。这样剧团慢慢形成了群众自己的组织。
