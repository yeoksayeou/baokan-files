Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 10th: London Dispatch: The British-Chinese Conference, initiated by British progressives after several months of preparation, is scheduled to be held in London from December 3rd to 4th. The purpose of the conference is to discuss the development of friendship and trade with New China, to understand the policies and future of New China, and to establish a permanent organization friendly to New China. The main sponsors of the British-Chinese Conference include: British Communist Party Vice Chairman Dutt, Amalgamated Union of Building Trade Workers Chairman Adam, Electrical Trades Union General Secretary Stevens, Independent Labour MP Pritt, Liberal Labour MP Millington, Cambridge University Professor Farrington, University of London Professor Childe, and many other celebrities, and it has received widespread support from people from all walks of life in Britain.

The British Communist Party's organ "World News and Views" weekly, published on November 5th, published a special commentary calling on all factories and trade unions to send more representatives to the British-Chinese Conference. The publication pointed out the significance of this conference, saying: "The importance of the conference is almost self-evident. ... Using British machinery and manufactured goods to exchange for China's surplus grain and raw materials could become an important part of many ways to extricate Britain from its current plight." However, the publication pointed out that, as Foreign Secretary Bevin stated in the House of Commons on October 19th, the British Labour government's foreign policy must be approved by Washington in advance before any decisions can be made. Therefore, "the British people must fight to achieve the goal of trading with and establishing diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China."

    在进步人士广泛支持下
    伦敦将开英中会议
    讨论发展对新中国的友谊
    【新华社布拉格十日电】伦敦航讯：由英国进步人士所发起的英中会议，经过数月的筹备工作之后，已定于十二月三日至四日在伦敦举行。会议的目的，在于讨论发展对新中国的友谊和贸易，认识新中国的政策和前途，并建立一个与新中国友好的常设机构。英中会议的主要赞助人有：英共副主席杜德、建筑业工人混合工会主席亚当、电气工会总书记斯蒂文斯、独立的工党议员普立特、自由主义的工党议员密林顿、鹅海大学教授法林顿、伦敦大学教授却尔德以及其他名流多人，并受到英国各界人士的广泛支持。
    十一月五日出版的英共机关刊物“世界新闻与评论”周刊特发表评论，号召一切工厂和工会应多派代表出席英中会议。该刊并指出这一会议的意义称：“会议的重要性几乎是无须强调的。……用英国的机器与制成品来换取中国剩余的粮食和原料，就可以成为解脱英国目前惨状的许多办法中的一个重要部分。”但是，该刊指出：正如外相贝文十月十九日在下院所声明的，英国工党政府的外交政策，事前必须获得华盛顿的允诺才能有所决定，因此，“英国人民必须经过战斗，才能达到与中华人民共和国进行贸易和建立外交关系的目的”。
