    Beijing Tram Company
    Implements Crew Responsibility System
    Huang Bojin and Others Win Awards for Inventing "Fire Glass Ring"
    [Beijing News] The Beijing Tram Company implemented a crew responsibility system starting on the 12th. On the 11th, the company held a conference to celebrate the implementation of the crew responsibility system and to present awards for good vehicle maintenance. Drivers Bao Delu and Zhao Guangzhi, who had no vehicle breakdowns, no accidents, no missed schedules, and no absences in September and October, received funds and prizes. Jia Tingsan, Deputy Director of the Municipal Bureau of Industry, and Song Ting, a representative of the Preparatory Committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, attended and spoke at the meeting. In their speeches, Deputy Director Jia and Wang Zhenwu, Deputy Manager of the company, expressed their hope that everyone would learn from Bao and Zhao's work ethic and integrate the spirit of cherishing vehicles into the crew responsibility system. Deputy Director Jia called on all employees to submit rationalization proposals, and any proposals that benefit the company after implementation would be rewarded.
    The company's crew responsibility system divides vehicle and road employees into groups of ten, using a fixed locomotive in two shifts, responsible for safekeeping, driving, cleaning, and simple repairs. In the past, when a shift system was in place, employees did not report problems to the next shift, and problems were often discovered only after one or two hours of driving, resulting in small problems becoming big problems and making it impossible to determine responsibility, leading to a high number of vehicle breakdowns. After liberation, workers spontaneously organized diligence, competition, learning, mutual assistance, and production groups to carry out activities such as cherishing vehicles and providing convenience to passengers. The company then implemented the crew responsibility system on the basis of these groups, and proposed five requirements: "Few breakdowns, no accidents; no missed schedules, no tardiness; on time, even car range (ie, driving distance); use extra strength, save electricity; no missed tickets, good attitude." Now, not only are vehicle and road employees actively responding to the implementation of the crew responsibility system, but some drivers are also requesting to drive broken vehicles in order to practice the slogan "Heroes drive broken cars." Other units in the factory are also actively responding. The repair and manufacturing plant is preparing to establish an inspection and testing system to strengthen vehicle maintenance. The power plant has decided to inspect machines according to plan and strive to save coal and electricity. The overhead line department began inspecting lines yesterday, and the civil engineering department also decided to emphasize both quality and quantity in road repairs.
    [Another News] The Beijing Tram Company Repair and Manufacturing Plant held an award ceremony on the 10th of this month to reward employees who made inventions and innovations in the Second Hundred-Vehicle Movement. The award winners included Huang Bojin and Yuan Fengxiang, who invented the "fire glass ring," and Xin Wenshan and Liu Mengxing, who invented the large gate box, as well as six others and a collective award for sealing light bulb sockets. In addition to the bonuses and prizes issued by the company, Director Mou also presented specially made Labor Model Medals to the two top models, Xin Wenshan and Huang Bojin.

    京市电车公司
    实行乘务负责制
    黄伯金等创造火玻璃圈得奖
    【北京讯】北京电车公司自十二日起，实行乘务负责制。该公司十一日特召开实行乘务负责制及车路发奖大会，对九、十两月不坏车、不肇事、不脱班、不请假的司机员保德禄、赵光稚，给予资金及奖品。市工业局贾庭三副局长、市总工会筹委会代表宋汀等均出席讲话。贾副局长及该公司王镇武副经理，在讲话中，希望大家学习保、赵二人的工作态度，把爱护车辆的精神，贯彻到乘务负责制中去。贾副局长号召全体职工，展开合理化建议，只要实行后对公司有好处，都有奖励。
    该公司的乘务负责制，是将车路员工，每十人组成一组，分两班使用一辆固定机车，负责保管、驾驶、清扫、及简单修理。以前实行轮乘制时，车有了毛病也不向接班人交代，常常行驶一二小时后才发现，结果小毛病成了大毛病，责任无法查明，所以坏车次数很多。解放后，工人自动组织了勤劳、竞赛、学习、互助、生产等小组，开展爱护车辆、便利乘客等运动。公司便在这些小组的基础上，实行乘务负责制。并提出：“少坏车、不肇祸；不脱班、不迟到；走正点、车当（即行车距离）匀；用余力、省电流；不漏票、态度好”五项要求。现在，不只车路员工积极响应实行乘务负责制，有的司机员还要求开坏车，以实践“好汉开坏车”的口号。该厂其他单位，也纷纷响应。修造厂准备定出检修和检查制度，以加强车辆的检修。发电厂决定有计划的检修机器，并努力节省煤电。架线课昨日已开始检查线路，土木课也决定在修道方面，质、量并重。
    【又讯】北京市电车公司修造厂，本月十日举行发奖大会，对第二次百辆车运动中有发明创造的职工进行给奖。得奖者有创造火玻璃圈的黄伯金、袁凤祥，创造大闸盒的辛文山、刘梦星等六人与粘灯泡口的集体奖一个。除公司发给奖金、奖品外，牟局长并将特制劳模奖章授与两名头等模范辛文山、黄伯金。
