The U.S. representative, unable to offer any forceful arguments to justify his opposition to the Soviet proposals, resorted to repeating the same old slanders against the Soviet Union's peaceful policies. The U.S. representative glossed over the fact that the United States had undermined the post-war agreements concluded by the U.S., Soviet Union, and Britain on the German question and the institutions for resolving international issues—the Council of Foreign Ministers. He attempted to shift this responsibility onto the Soviet Union.

Austin attempted to deny the aggressive nature of the North Atlantic Treaty, whose dangerous aggressive nature even publications like the Wall Street Journal, the mouthpiece of U.S. monopoly capital, do not conceal. He completely ignored the unbridled slander campaign against the Soviet people being waged by reactionary American newspapers, hypocritically complaining about the lack of cultural exchange between the United States and the Soviet Union. But the U.S. representative did not say a word about the shameful behavior of the U.S. authorities towards the few Soviet representatives allowed to reside in the United States.

The U.S. representative also avoided mentioning that a necessary prerequisite for any cultural exchange is the normalization of relations between the U.S. and the Soviet Union—a normalization that representatives of progressive circles in the United States have urged and demanded. He also failed to mention that an indispensable condition for achieving this normalization is to stop the unrestrained anti-Soviet slander campaign being conducted by a tiny minority of insane war-mongers in the United States. This propaganda is encouraged by the U.S. government, and the Soviet government's proposal is precisely aimed at it.

In general, the U.S. representative's speech completely failed to address the facts cited by Vyshinsky in his speech regarding the intensified war propaganda and preparations by the U.S.-British aggressive bloc. These facts have caused alarm among peace-loving countries, which demand that such war-mongering activities be stopped and that peace be sought among nations. In essence, Austin's speech indicates that the U.S. government has refused to support the Soviet proposal for effectively maintaining peace. Austin demanded that the General Assembly reject the Soviet proposal, saying that it contradicts the proposals of the U.S. and Britain. He put forward a joint U.S.-British proposal, which is pieced together with vague phrases randomly drawn from various documents (such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights). Since this proposal does not stipulate that anyone is responsible for anything, it cannot solve the task of consolidating peace and curbing the instigators of new wars, which hundreds of millions of people around the world are eagerly awaiting the General Assembly to resolve.

　　战贩疯狂反苏宣传受到美国政府鼓励
  　美代表故意回避苏联责难
    美国代表因为不能提出任何有力量的论据来证明他对苏联建议的反对，就又把反对苏联和平政策的谩骂老调，全套重复了一遍。美国代表对于美国破坏了美、苏、英三国关于德国问题、关于解决国际问题的机构——外长会议问题以及其它问题所缔结的战后协定一事，撇开不谈。他企图把这个责任转嫁到苏联身上。
    奥斯汀企图否认北大西洋公约的侵略性质，这个公约的危险的侵略性质甚至象美国垄断资本机关报华尔街日报这样的刊物都不加以掩饰。他完全不谈反动的美国报章对苏联人民所进行的肆无忌惮的诽谤运动，却虚伪地说什么美国与苏联之间的文化交流不够。但是这位美国代表关于美国当局对少数被允许驻美的苏联代表所采取的可耻行为，却只字不提。
    美国代表对于这一点也避开不谈，即：任何一种文化交流的必要先决条件，是美苏两国之间关系的正常化——美国进步方面的代表曾敦促与要求过这种正常化。他也丝毫不提，要想实现这种正常化，不可缺少的条件是制止现在美国极少数疯狂的战争贩子所进行的恣肆的反苏诽谤宣传。这种宣传受到了美国政府的鼓励，苏联政府的提案正是对它而发的。
    总的来说，美国代表的演说完全没有回答维辛斯基在其演说中所援引的关于美英侵略集团加紧新战争宣传与准备的事实。这些事实引起了爱好和平国家的惊恐，它们要求制止这种制造战争的活动及寻求各国的和平。实质上，奥斯汀的演说表示美政府已拒绝支持苏联关于有效地维持和平的提案。奥斯汀要求大会否决苏联的提案说，这一提案是与美英两国的提案相违反的。他提出了美英的联合提案，这个提案是由各种各样的文件（例如人权宣言）中胡乱拉来的空泛辞句堆砌而成的。由于这一提案并没有规定任何人对任何事情担负义务，它是不能够解决举世亿万人民引颈期待大会予以解决的巩固和平与遏制新战争挑拨者的任务的。
