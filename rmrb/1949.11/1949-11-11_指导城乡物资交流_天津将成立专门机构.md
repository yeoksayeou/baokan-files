    Guiding Urban-Rural Material Exchange
    Tianjin to Establish a Special Organization
    [Special Dispatch from Our Tianjin Correspondent] After listening to feedback from all parties at the Tianjin Industrial Exhibition, it was keenly felt that it is imperative to organize and guide urban-rural material exchange in a planned manner in the future. On the 10th, a proposal was initiated to establish an Urban-Rural Material Exchange Guidance Committee, in order to unite the forces of the state-owned economy, the cooperative economy, and the private economy under the general economic policy for all sides. Under the unified leadership of the People's Government, it will guide and promote urban-rural mutual assistance and material exchange to develop production. Yesterday afternoon, representatives from the Tianjin Industry and Commerce Bureau and the business community gathered to discuss this, and will continue to broadly solicit opinions from all parties to organize a formal organization and launch operations.
