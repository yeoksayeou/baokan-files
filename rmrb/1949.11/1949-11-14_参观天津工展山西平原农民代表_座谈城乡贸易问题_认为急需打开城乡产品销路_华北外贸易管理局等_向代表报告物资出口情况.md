    [This newspaper Tianjin dispatch] Yesterday (the 13th) at 1:00 PM, the farmer representatives from Shanxi and Pingyuan provinces were divided into three groups—mountain products and medicinal materials, grains, cotton and oil crops, and hides and bristles—to hold a symposium to exchange views on urban-rural trade issues. Everyone unanimously believed that the serious problem currently existing in urban-rural trade is the stagnation of product sales, not the so-called problem of low purchasing power in general. For example, the egg company lacks eggs and urgently needs to purchase them, but in the Jinan area of Shanxi province, of the eggs produced this year, excluding local use, a statistically remaining 36 million eggs cannot find sales channels. In the Liancheng area of Pingyuan province, 1,030,000 jin of black dates were produced this year and are still stockpiled locally, but the foreign demand for black dates cannot be met. On the other hand, the vast rural areas urgently need industrial finished products from the cities but cannot buy them, such as waterwheels, coal, iron, fertilizer, insecticides, dyes, cloth, soda ash, matches, etc., which cannot be supplied to the rural areas in a timely manner.
    [Another dispatch] In order to enable farmer representatives from Shanxi and Pingyuan provinces to have a clearer understanding of the export commodity situation after liberation, yesterday (the 13th) at 8:00 AM, the North China Foreign Trade Bureau and the managers of the North China Pig Bristles, Hides and Furs, Native Products, Eggs, and Oils professional companies successively reported the business operations of their respective companies to the farmer representatives. All companies unanimously hoped that the farmer representatives would widely publicize to the farmers after returning home, paying great attention to the care and preservation of the above-mentioned export commodities.范仰民, Manager Fan Yangmin of the Egg Products Company, gave a particularly detailed introduction to chicken raising knowledge, hoping that the majority of rural farmers would improve their chicken raising methods and increase egg production.
    [Another dispatch] The North China Foreign Trade Bureau, Domestic and Foreign Trade Company, and Tianjin Military Control Commission Industrial Bureau jointly hosted a banquet yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM to entertain farmer representatives from Shanxi and Pingyuan provinces. At the banquet, Cao Zhongshu of the North China Foreign Trade Bureau delivered a short speech, and then the meal began. After the meal, the Farmers' Reception Office of the Industrial Exhibition invited the farmer representatives to go to the Central Cinema to watch a movie.

    参观天津工展山西平原农民代表
    座谈城乡贸易问题
    认为急需打开城乡产品销路
    华北外贸易管理局等
    向代表报告物资出口情况
    【本报天津专电】昨日（十三日）下午一时，山西、平原两省农民代表分为：山货药材、粮食棉花油料、皮毛猪鬃等三个组举行座谈，交换有关城乡贸易问题。大家一致认为目前城乡贸易存在严重问题是产品销路停滞，不是一般所谓购买力低的问题，如蛋品公司缺乏鸡蛋，急待收购，但山西晋南专区今年所产鸡蛋除本地使用外，统计剩余三千六百余万鸡蛋找不到销路；平原省联城专区今年产乌枣一万零三十万斤，尚堆存当地，但国外需要乌枣的又供不应求。另一方面，广大农村中迫切的需要城市的工业成品，却又购不到，如水车、煤、铁、肥料、杀虫剂、染料、布匹、碱面、火柴等，不能及时供给农村。
    【又电】为使山西、平原两省农民代表，更明确了解解放后的出口物资情况，昨日（十三日）上午八时由华北对外贸易管理局与华北猪鬃、皮毛、土产、蛋品、油脂各专业公司经理，连续向农民代表报告各该公司业务经营情况，各公司一致希望农民代表返里后向农民广为宣传，对上述各出口物资深加爱惜和保存。蛋品公司经理范仰民特详细介绍养鸡常识，希望广大农村农民提高养鸡办法，增加蛋品产量。
    【又电】华北对外贸易管理局、内外贸易公司及天津市军管会工业处于昨日下午五时联合设宴招待山西、平原两省农民代表，宴会上，华北对外贸易管理局曹中枢简短致词后，旋即进餐，餐后工展会农民招待处请农民代表赴中央电影院看电影。
