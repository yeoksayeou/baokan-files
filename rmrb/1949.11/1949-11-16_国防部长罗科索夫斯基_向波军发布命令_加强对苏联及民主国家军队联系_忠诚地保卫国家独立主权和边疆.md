Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 15th: Warsaw News Agency of Poland: On assuming the position of Minister of National Defence on the 7th, Polish Marshal Rokossovsky issued an order to the Polish army, stating: "On this occasion of assuming the duties of Minister of National Defence and Commander of the Polish Army, I, on behalf of the Polish Army, congratulate my predecessor, Marshal Zymiersky, for his continued fruitful work for the benefit of the country in his new position. Soldiers! I have served in the heroic Soviet Army for many years in the cause of peace-loving people. In the last war, I served as a front-line commander, at which time the People's Polish Army, which was then being established, fought bravely on this line. They fought continuously in the glorious battles of Warsaw, Danzig, Czerniaków, and all the way to the Battle of Berlin. As a commander and a Pole, I am deeply proud of the contribution made by the Polish Army fighting on the Soviet side to defeat fascism. The Polish Army has been tempered in successive victorious battles for the freedom of the motherland, infused with fraternal friendship with the Soviet Army, and together with the fraternal People's Republics, defends peace, democracy, and socialism. Today, I have assumed command of the Polish Army, aware of the responsibilities entrusted to me by the state and the president, aware of my responsibilities to the Polish nation and the Polish working people (from whom I come and with whom I am inextricably linked), and to our fraternal Soviet people (who educated me to become a soldier and a commander), I will devote all my energy to developing the strength of our army. I will defend peace side by side with the Soviet Army, the leader of this peaceful cause is the great Stalin.
    I order: The officers and soldiers of the Polish Army should emulate the heroes of Warsaw, Danzig, Czerniaków, and Berlin, loyally defend the People's Poland, its independence, sovereignty, and its borders on the Oder, Neisse, and Baltic Sea; strengthen the fraternal ties with the powerful Soviet Army and the armies of the People's Democracies; strengthen political work and military training, strengthen the conscious discipline of the army and the close ties with the working people—the masters of the liberated motherland! Salute to the People's Poland, the Polish-Soviet alliance, and President Bierut!"

    【新华社北京十五日电】波兰通讯社华沙讯：波兰元帅罗科索夫斯基于七日就任国防部长时，向波兰军队发布命令称：“值此就任国防部长与波军统帅之际，我代表波兰军队祝贺我的前任齐默尔斯基元帅在新的冈位上继续为国家的利益做出成果丰硕的工作。战士们！我在英雄的苏联军队里服务于爱好和平的人民的事业，已经多年了。在上次战争中，我做了一个前线的司令员，那时正在创立的人民波兰军队就在这一线英勇作战。他们都曾在光荣的战役——华沙、但泽、琴尼亚、一直到柏林战役，连续作战。作为一个司令员和一个波兰人，我深以站在苏联方面作战的波军对击败法西斯主义所作的贡献而感到骄傲。波军在为祖国自由的历次胜利的战斗中受到锻炼，灌注着对苏军的兄弟情谊，并与各兄弟人民共和国一起保卫和平、民主与社会主义。今天我担当了波军的统帅，意识到国家和总统委派给我的职责，意识到我对波兰民族及波兰劳动人民（我自他们中来并与他们息息相关）对我们兄弟般的苏联人民（他们把我教育成为战士，成为统帅）的责任，我将以我的全部精力发展我们军队的力量。我将与苏联军队并肩保卫和平，这和平事业的领袖，便是伟大的斯大林。
    我命令：波兰军队的将士们效法华沙、但泽、琴尼亚、柏林的英雄的榜样，忠诚地保卫人民的波兰、它的独立、主权和它在奥德河、尼斯河和波罗的海的边疆；加强对强有力的苏联军队和各人民民主国家的军队的兄弟情谊的联系；加强政治工作与军事训练，加强军队的自觉的纪律以及与劳动人民——解放了的祖国的主人——牢固的联系！向人民的波兰、波苏联盟与贝鲁特总统致敬”
