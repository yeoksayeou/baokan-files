　　On the Birth of New Germany
　　Huang Caoliang

　　On October 7th, the German People's Council, elected by universal suffrage of the German people, held its ninth meeting in Berlin, declaring itself the Provisional People's Chamber, resolving to organize the Provisional Government of the German Democratic Republic, and passing the manifesto of the National Front of Democratic Germany, which put forward twenty tasks, including restoring the political and economic unity of Germany, concluding a just peace treaty as soon as possible, unconditionally recognizing the Potsdam Agreement, actively fighting against warmongers and defending world peace, and granting the German people genuine democratic rights, as the common program of struggle for all democratic parties and people of all strata in Germany. On the same day in the evening, the Provisional People's Chamber held its first meeting, elected the Presidium of the Provisional People's Chamber, and elected Otto Grotewohl, Chairman of the Socialist Unity Party, as the Prime Minister of the Provisional Government of the Republic. The meeting formulated and adopted the organizational law on the Provisional People's Chamber, the Provisional Senate and the Provisional Government, and announced that the Constitution of the German Democratic Republic, approved by the Third German People's Congress on May 30th of this year, would be implemented. On October 10th, the state parliaments held special meetings to elect senators. On the same day, the Provisional People's Chamber and the Provisional Senate held a joint meeting and unanimously elected Wilhelm Pieck, Chairman of the Socialist Unity Party, as the President of the Republic. On the 12th, the Provisional Government of the Republic, headed by Grotewohl, was officially formed.

　　The establishment of the German Democratic Republic aroused cheers from people of all countries. A million-strong celebration demonstration was held in Berlin, the capital of Germany, and mass celebration rallies were also held in many places in West Germany. Joseph Stalin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, and leaders of various people's democratic countries, sent congratulatory telegrams. Progressive public opinion around the world rejoiced. On October 10th, General Chuikov, Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Military Administration in Germany, declared under orders that the administrative powers formerly belonging to the Soviet Military Administration would be transferred to the Provisional Government of the Republic. On the 15th, the Soviet government decided to exchange diplomatic representatives with the Provisional Government of the Republic. Subsequently, the governments of China, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea decided one after another to establish diplomatic relations with the German Democratic Republic and suggested exchanging diplomatic representatives.

　　A new Germany, supported and拥护ed by the vast German people and progressive humanity in the world, was born from then on. The German people and all people who uphold peace, democracy, and progress in the world enthusiastically cheered for the birth of the new Germany, because the establishment of the German Democratic Republic and its Provisional Government is a major event with epoch-making significance in the history of Germany and Europe.

　　The great leader of mankind, Stalin, accurately pointed out in his congratulatory telegram on October 13th: "The establishment of a peace-loving democratic republic of Germany is a turning point in European history. There is no doubt that the parallel existence of a peace-loving democratic Germany and a peace-loving Soviet Union makes new wars impossible in Europe, ends the bloodshed in Europe, and makes it impossible for world imperialism to enslave European countries. …As long as the people of these two countries show their determination to fight for peace… then peace in Europe can be considered guaranteed."

　　Why is the establishment of the German Democratic Republic a turning point in European history? And why is it that there is no longer the possibility of new wars breaking out in Europe?

　　As everyone knows, historically, Germany has been one of the most imperialist and aggressive countries. It once became the source of two world wars and the center of militarism and fascism. At the beginning of the 20th century, Germany had already become one of the world's leading industrial powers. In terms of steel and iron production, it had already caught up with Britain at that time, second only to the United States and accounting for the second largest share in the world. The German imperialism, which controlled such a huge economic potential at that time, became one of the main culprits in launching World War I in order to further seize new markets and plunder colonies. World War I ended with Germany's defeat, which greatly weakened the strength of German imperialism. However, with the support of the imperialist countries of the victorious nations, especially under the policy of American imperialism to actively restore German monopoly capital and turn Germany into a European gendarme against the Soviet Union and against the revolutionary movement, German imperialism was quickly rearmed. According to the materials cited by Soviet Yermashov in his book "The Historical Facts of American Imperialism's Support for German Aggression," the total amount of foreign loans to Germany from 1924 to 1931 was 6.55 billion US dollars, most of which were paid or planned by American banks. Before World War II, Germany had a population of about 70 million, the largest of the capitalist countries in Europe. Industrial production accounted for 12 percent of total world industrial production, ranking second in the capitalist world. This enabled German militarism to revive rapidly. Since Hitler came to power in 1933 and established a fascist dictatorship, the militarism that carried out foreign aggression rapidly developed to its peak. From then on, German fascist militarism became the second source of war in the world at that time in Central Europe and became the culprit for launching another world war.

　　Now, on the ruins of this place that once served as the source of two world wars and the center of militarism, a peace-loving German Democratic Republic has been born. This event undoubtedly has great historical significance and profound impact for Germany, for Europe, and for the world. This is a great transformation in German history.

　　At present, the establishment of the German Democratic Republic is of great significance in the struggle of the world's peace and democratic forces against the imperialist camp. It seriously struck a blow to the arrogant conspiracy of American imperialism to use Germany as a major base for launching new wars of aggression. After the end of World War II, American imperialism, which replaced the position of the German aggressors before the war, attempted to restore Germany to a militarist country as it did after World War I, as its main base for enslaving Europe and launching World War III. Because Germany still occupies a very important position in Europe after the war. Geographically, it occupies the center of Europe and is close to the new democratic countries of Czechoslovakia and Poland. In terms of human and economic potential, it is still the largest of the capitalist countries in Europe. In the view of American imperialism, no capitalist country other than Germany is sufficient to serve its arrogant plan to conquer the world. According to American imperialism, "controlling Germany means controlling Europe," and "without Germany, it is impossible to defend (should be read as enslave) Western Europe" (United Press International, November 6). Therefore, controlling Germany as a base for aggression has become the center of American imperialism's post-war aggressive diplomacy towards Europe.

　　After Nazi Germany surrendered in May 1945, according to the Yalta and Potsdam agreements, except for the return of the territory east of the Oder and Neisse rivers to Poland and the cession of Königsberg and northern East Prussia to the Soviet Union, the entire territory of Germany and the capital Berlin were divided into four occupation zones, with a Allied Control Council composed of the four countries of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain and France, as the supreme authority in Germany, to uniformly handle general German affairs; and it was stipulated that during the occupation period, Germany should be regarded as a unified whole; At the same time, the purpose of occupation and control was determined to be the complete eradication of militarism and the implementation of democratization, and to promote the establishment of a unified and democratic German government in order to sign a peace treaty and ensure the fulfillment of all obligations stipulated in the Potsdam and other agreements to the Allied countries.

　　However, for more than four years, the United States, colluding with the reactionary factions of Britain and France, completely destroyed the Potsdam and other international agreements. In addition to actively supporting the Nazis, reviving militarism, suppressing democracy, and restoring Germany's war potential, they also adopted a stubborn policy of splitting Germany in an attempt to annex the entire Germany.

　　On January 1, 1947, the US-British occupation zones began to implement the economic merger agreement. On April 17 of the same year, the US, British and French occupation zones unilaterally signed the agreement on the export and distribution of Ruhr coal. On June 18, 1948, the occupying authorities of the United States, Britain and France implemented a separate "currency reform" and issued new currencies throughout the western occupation zone. On October 18 of the same year, the US, British and French occupation zones signed a foreign trade merger agreement. Through this series of measures, the economic merger of the US, British and French occupation zones has achieved the economic division of Germany. At the same time, American imperialism also carried out measures to dismember Germany politically. In January 1948, the US and British occupying authorities established a reorganized management agency for the joint occupation zone, established the Supreme Court of the joint occupation zone and the German State Bank. From February to June 1948, the United States, Britain and France held a London conference and decided to establish a West German state and convene a puppet parliament. On April 8, 1949, the United States, Britain and France formulated the West German "Occupation Statute," attempting to replace the peace treaty with this statute that would control West Germany for a long time. On May 6, the puppet "Bonn Constitutional Conference" manufactured by the United States and other reactionaries in September 1948 passed a resolution to establish a West German provisional government and approved the "Bonn Constitution." On September 20, the separate governments of the US, British and French occupation zones were formed in Bonn. So far, the reactionary policy of dismembering Germany under the leadership of American imperialism has been finally completed. American imperialism attempts to rely on West Germany to carry out aggression and wants to further吞并 East Germany as well.

　　论新德国的诞生
    黄操良
    十月七日，由德国人民普选产生的德国人民代表大会所选出的德国人民委员会，在柏林召开第九次会议，宣布自身为人民临时议会，决议组织德意志民主共和国临时政府，并通过了民主德国全国阵线宣言，提出了二十项任务，包括恢复德国政治与经济的统一，尽早缔结公正和约，无条件承认波茨坦决定，积极为反对战争贩子与保卫世界和平而斗争，以及予德国人民以真正民主权利等，作为德国各民主党派与各阶层人民的共同斗争纲领。同日晚，人民临时议会举行首届会议，选举了人民临时议会主席团，并选出统一社会党主席格罗提渥为共和国临时政府总理。会议制订和通过了关于临时人民议会、临时参议院和临时政府组织法，并宣布由第三届德国人民代表大会于今年五月三十日批准的德意志民主共和国宪法付诸实施。十月十日，各州议会召开特别会议，举行参议员选举。同日，临时人民议会与临时参议院举行联席会议，一致选举统一社会党主席皮克为共和国总统。十二日，以格罗提渥为首的共和国临时政府正式组成。
    德意志民主共和国的成立引起了各国人民的欢呼。德国首都柏林举行了百万人的庆祝大示威，西德许多地方也纷纷举行了群众庆祝大会。苏联部长会议主席斯大林、中华人民共和国中央人民政府主席毛泽东以及各人民民主国家的领袖等，均纷电祝贺。全世界进步舆论为之欢欣鼓舞。十月十日，德境苏联军政府总督崔可夫奉命声明将前此属于苏联军政府的行政职权，移交给共和国临时政府。十五日，苏联政府决定与共和国临时政府互派外交代表。接着，中国、捷克、保加利亚、匈牙利、波兰、罗马尼亚、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国等七国政府，均先后决定与德意志民主共和国建立外交关系，并建议互派外交代表。
    一个为德国广大人民和世界进步人类支持与拥护的新德国，从此诞生了。德国人民和全世界一切拥护和平、民主、进步的人们热烈地为新德国之诞生而欢呼，就因为德意志民主共和国及其临时政府之成立，乃是在德国和欧洲历史上一件具有划时代意义的重大事变。
    人类的伟大领袖斯大林在十月十三日的贺电中，曾确切指明：“德意志民主的爱好和平的共和国的成立，是欧洲历史的转折点。无可怀疑，爱好和平的民主的德国与爱好和平的苏联的并肩存在，使得欧洲不再有新战争的可能，结束欧洲的流血，并使世界帝国主义奴役欧洲国家成为不可能。……只要这两国人民表现决心为和平而战……那么和平在欧洲可以认为有了保证。”
    德意志民主共和国的成立为什么是欧洲历史的转折点？又为什么欧洲不再有爆发新战争的可能呢？
    大家知道，在历史上，德国是最富于帝国主义侵略性的一个国家，它曾经成为两次世界大战的策源地和军国主义与法西斯主义的中心。当二十世纪之初，德国就已成为世界头等工业国之一。就钢和铁的生产量来说，当时即已赶上了英国，仅次于美国而占世界第二位。当时掌握着这样庞大的经济潜力的德帝国主义，为了进一步夺取新市场和抢劫殖民地，就成为发动第一次世界大战的罪魁祸首之一。第一次世界大战是以德国的失败而结束了，这曾大大削弱了德帝国主义的力量。但在战胜国的帝国主义国家的扶植下，特别是在美帝国主义积极恢复德国独占资本和把德国变为反对苏联、反对革命运动的欧洲宪兵的政策下，德帝国主义很快地就被重新武装起来了。据苏联叶尔马旭夫所著“美帝国主义扶植德国侵略史实”一文引用的材料，自一九二四年到一九三一年的七年中，外国给德国的贷款总数达六十五亿五千万美元，其中大部分均由美国银行支付或筹划的。到第二次世界大战以前，德国约有七千万人口，是欧洲资本主义国家中人口最多的一个。工业生产则占世界工业总生产的百分之十二，居资本主义世界的第二位。这就使德国军国主义迅速复活。自希特勒在一九三三年上台建立了法西斯专政以后，实行对外侵略的军国主义迅速发展到登峰造极的地步，德国法西斯军国主义从此就在欧洲中部成为当时世界上第二个战争策源地，成了又一次发动世界大战的祸首。
    现在，在这个曾经作为两次世界大战策源地和军国主义中心的废墟上，一个爱好和平的德意志民主共和国诞生了。这一事件对于德国，对于欧洲，对于全世界，无疑具有伟大的历史意义和深刻的影响。这是德国历史上伟大的转变。
    在目前，德意志民主共和国的建立，在世界和平民主力量对帝国主义阵营的斗争中，具有重大的意义。它严重地打击了美帝国主义利用德国作为发动新侵略战争主要基地的狂妄阴谋。在第二次世界大战结束以后，代替战前德国侵略者地位的美帝国主义，妄图象第一次世界大战以后那样，恢复德国为军国主义的国家，作为其奴役欧洲和发动第三次世界大战的主要基地。因为战后德国在欧洲仍占有极重要的地位。从地理上来说，它占据着欧洲的中心，并紧靠新民主国家捷克和波兰。从人力和经济潜力来说，它仍然是欧洲资本主义国家中最大的国家。在美帝国主义看来，除了德国而外，是没有任何一个资本主义国家足以为它的狂妄的征服世界的侵略计划服务的。依照美帝国主义的说法，“控制德国，便能控制欧洲”，“若没有德国，便不可能保卫（应读作奴役）西欧”（合众社十一月六日电）。因此，控制德国作为侵略基地，就成为美帝国主义战后对欧侵略外交的中心。
    在纳粹德国于一九四五年五月投降以后，按照雅尔塔及波茨坦等协定，除奥德河与涅西河以东割还波兰，哥尼斯堡与东普鲁士北部割让苏联以外，把德国全部领土以及首都柏林划分为四个占领区，由苏美英法四国组成一个盟国管制委员会，作为德国境内的最高权力机关，统一处置全德国一般事件；并规定在占领期间，应视德国为一个统一的整体；同时确定了占领与管制的目的在于彻底肃清军国主义与实行民主化，促进建立统一的民主德国政府，以便签订和约，保证对盟国履行波茨坦等协定所规定的一切义务。
    然而四年多来美国勾结英法两国反动派完全破坏了波茨坦等国际协定，它们除了积极地扶植纳粹、复活军国主义、压制民主和恢复德国战争潜力以外，还采取了顽强地分裂德国从而企图兼并整个德国的政策。
    一九四七年一月一日，美英两占区开始执行了经济合并协定。同年四月十七日，美英法三占区片面地签订了鲁尔煤的输出和分配协定。一九四八年六月十八日，美英法占领当局实行单独的“货币改革”，在整个西占区发行新货币。同年十月十八日，美英法三占区签订了对外贸易合并协定。经过这一串的措施，美英法三占区在经济上的合并，已经达成在经济上分裂德国。与此同时，美帝国主义还进行了在政治上的肢解德国的措施。一九四八年一月，美英占领当局成立了改组联合占领区的管理机构，建立了联占区的最高法院和德国州银行。一九四八年二月到六月，美英法三国举行了伦敦会议，决定成立西德国家和召开傀儡议会等。一九四九年四月八日，美英法三国制订了西德“占领法规”，企图以这个长期控制西德的法规，来代替对德和约。五月六日，由美国等反动派于一九四八年九月制造的傀儡“波恩制宪会议”，通过了成立西德临时政府的决议，并批准“波恩宪法”。九月二十日，美英法占领区的分立政府在波恩组成。至此，美帝国主义领导下的肢解德国的反动政策已经最后完成。美帝国主义企图依托西德进行侵略，并想进一步把东德也吞并进去。
