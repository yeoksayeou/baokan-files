Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 4th. All of the 15 million mu of wheat fields in Shanxi Province have now been sown, and in some areas, the wheat seedlings have already sprouted green shoots. This year's wheat planting work in the province was delayed until the autumn harvest season due to continuous rain for half a month from the beginning of September. All labor and animal power were mobilized to carry out a concentrated rush planting. In Yicheng Prefecture alone, 300,000 men and women laborers and more than 76,000 head of livestock were投入into the autumn planting campaign. In the wheat planting process, all localities generally paid attention to deep plowing, fine cultivation, increasing fertilizer application, and soaking and selecting seeds. In the province, 10 million mu of wheat fields were plowed more than twice, and half of the wheat fields were "plowed three times and harrowed twice." In terms of increasing fertilizer application, according to statistics from six districts and 123 villages in Xinxian County and other counties in northern Shanxi: a total of more than 24,890,000 catties of Artemisia grass were cut and composted in advance, and more than 2.2 million dan of miscellaneous fertilizer were accumulated, with an average of about 40 dan of fertilizer applied per mu. In Pingshun County in southeastern Shanxi, each mu reached 75 dan, exceeding any previous year. In order to prevent and control diseases and pests, all localities carried out seed soaking. With the help of the Provincial Government's Agricultural Technology Extension Team, 40% of the wheat field seeds in 19 counties in central Shanxi underwent seed soaking or seed mixing. In Changzhi Prefecture, those who soaked seeds accounted for 80% of the total number of wheat fields. In terms of carefully selecting wheat seeds, farmers in Wuxiang, Huguan, and Yu counties alone voluntarily exchanged 8,200 shi of improved varieties. People's governments at all levels also rectified and strengthened the work of tilling the land on behalf of the families of revolutionary martyrs, soldiers, and workers. In the old liberated areas, under the slogan of "soldiers' families first, then ourselves," the method of contracted cultivation and guaranteed output was adopted, which was generally done well. The Shanxi Provincial People's Government also provided more than 4,000 shi of wheat seeds with emphasis, to help the families of revolutionary martyrs, soldiers, and workers in disaster areas and poor peasants solve their seed difficulties.

　　山西省完成种麦
    一千五百万亩麦田全部下种
  　作到了深耕细作增肥浸种
    【新华社太原四日电】山西省全省一千五百余万亩麦田，现已播种完毕，有些地区的麦田，已长出了碧绿的麦苗。今年全省种麦工作，由于各地自九月初起霪雨连绵达半月之久，推迟至秋收时节才大规模开始，各地劳畜力都全部动员起来，进行突击抢种。仅翼城专区就有三十万男女劳动力和七万六千余犋牲口投入秋种运动中。种麦中各地普遍地注意了深耕细作、增施肥料和浸种选种等工作。全省有一千万亩麦田做到普犁两遍以上，有一半麦田作到“犁三耙二”。增肥方面，据晋北忻县等县六个区另一百二十三个村的统计：事先共割蒿沤肥二千四百八十九万余斤，积杂肥二百二十余万担，平均每亩上肥在四十担左右。晋东南平顺县每亩达七十五担，超过以往任何一年。为了防除病害，各地都进行了浸种工作，晋中十九个县在省政府农业技术推广队的帮助下，有百分之四十的麦田的种子经过浸种或拌种。长治专区浸种者，占麦田总数百分之八十。在精选麦种上，仅武乡、壶关、盂县三个县，农民自动调换优良品种达八千二百石。各级人民政府并整顿和加强了烈、军、工属的代耕工作，老区在“先军属后自己”的口号下，采用包耕包产办法，一般作得较好。山西省人民政府并有重点的贷发麦籽四千余石，帮助灾区烈军工属及贫苦农民解决种子困难。
