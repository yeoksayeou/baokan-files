　　Chahar Provincial People's Government Formulates Measures
　　To Launch Winter Study Movement
    [Our Newspaper Despatch] In order to utilize the winter slack season, launch a winter study movement, and improve the political and cultural level of the masses, the Chahar Provincial People's Government formulated the "Measures for Launching the Winter Study Movement" on the 7th of this month, stipulating that the winter study period will be three and a half to four months, with the start of school no earlier than the first day of the tenth lunar month and no later than the fifteenth day of the tenth lunar month. The measures pointed out that the guiding principle and task of this year's winter study are: "To achieve the goal of raising the political awareness of the masses and stimulating the production enthusiasm of the masses through the winter study movement." The measures stipulate that basic-level organizations must be established in various places, and the village (street) must, through the village (street) people's congress or representative meeting, elect relevant personnel and enthusiastic educators to participate in this work and form a winter study committee to be responsible for planning and promoting it. In promoting the movement, the mass line must be followed, and coercion, commandism, and formalism must be opposed. The prescribed courses and teaching time are: "In the areas where land reform has been carried out: Politics and production each three days a time, the rest of the time for cultural lessons and current affairs. In areas where land reform has not been carried out: Land reform and politics each three days a time, the rest of the time can be used for current affairs education as appropriate, and cultural lessons can be carried out according to the needs of the masses. In some disaster areas: Production, disaster relief, and politics each three days a time, the rest of the classes can be carried out as appropriate." The measures finally pointed out: "Education departments at all levels should strive to take the initiative, contact relevant departments, concentrate forces, combine with the central work, take care of mass activities, focus on achieving widespread development. Through the winter study movement, the central work this winter will be well completed, and a foundation will be laid for next year's large-scale production and regular people's schools."
