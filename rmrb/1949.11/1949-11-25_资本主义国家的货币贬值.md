Currency Devaluation in Capitalist Countries
By Shige Yewa, translated by Sun Zhigong

The financial negotiations in Washington between Britain's Cripps and Bevin and America's Acheson and Snyder did not achieve their professed aim of restoring confidence and tranquility, but instead led to a financial shock. On September 18, the devaluation of the pound became a reality. Each pound depreciated by more than 30 percent, which was clearly beyond the expectations of the international trading market. Currently, each pound is exchanged for $2.80 instead of $4.03.

Under this rash depreciation, the pound dragged down the value of the currencies of the British Dominions, colonies, Marshall Plan countries, and countries in the Sterling Area. Within two or three days, twenty-three capitalist countries, including France, Canada, Sweden, the Netherlands, Denmark, Finland, India, and Italy, reduced their currency exchange rates. This wave will obviously spread to other capitalist countries as well. Stock exchanges and various markets have fallen into a state of frenzy. Speculators, anticipating an inevitable rise in prices, are buying commodities, and Vatican agents are also buying gold coins.

The devaluation of these twenty-odd currencies is an event of great international significance, the incalculable impact of which cannot be fully determined at present. However, some facts are noteworthy.

First, it is quite obvious that a direct and immediate consequence of devaluation is the rise in prices and cost of living, thereby further worsening the living standards of the working people. In Britain, on the day after the devaluation, the price of bread increased by 30 percent because Britain buys its wheat from the United States. In the Marshall Plan countries, the price increases for bread, coal, and tobacco are just the beginning. The cost of living will continue to rise. The fall in real wages is already a fact, and not a fact of tomorrow, but a fact of today. Thus, the plan for "reducing production costs" that the giants of Wall Street and the City of London have long contemplated has now been implemented at the expense of the interests of the working class. The Italian press is extremely frank on this point. "Il Grido del Popolo" declared:

"The devaluation of currency is purely and simply a representation of reducing production costs, or rather, an indirect means of achieving a reduction in production costs, because the direct method of simply reducing workers' wages cannot succeed."

"Corriere della Sera" and "La Stampa" also openly stated that in order to "increase the competitive strength in foreign markets" by pretext of "cutting domestic production costs," currency devaluation must first be implemented to suppress the living standards of the working class.

It is quite obvious that the capitalists, suffering from the increasing competition in foreign markets and the drop in prices, coupled with the higher prices of raw materials and goods paid in US dollars, which makes production costs even higher, want to recover their losses from the workers.

We know that the Labour ministers in Britain have long advocated sacrificing the working class to reduce production costs. The consistent policy of freezing wages and prohibiting strikes that they have forcibly implemented with the help of the Trades Union Congress, its purpose is now very clear.

Among the many unpopular measures of the US-British rulers, currency devaluation breaks the record. The people and public opinion of all countries have expressed extreme resentment towards this financial measure.

In Britain, the first result of the devaluation of the pound was an increase in the price of bread, and it is expected that general living costs will increase greatly in the near future. This expectation was not denied by Cripps when he gave his first vague explanation of the reasons for the devaluation. This has aroused strong opposition from various branches of the union. How the working masses assess the actions of the Labour government can be seen in the resolution of the Barrow-in-Furness First Branch of the Amalgamated Engineering Union. In that resolution, currency devaluation was described as a "vicious attack on the living standards of workers." British workers know that a shameful deal has been made between American monopoly capital and the City of London, forcibly suppressing the living standards of the people, so that British monopolists can obtain cheap labor, and facilitate the invasion of the British Empire by American capital.

In such a climate of widespread resentment and consternation, the British trade union leaders remained silent. Lawther, Deakin, and Dukes forced through a resolution at the Trades Union Congress, the purpose of which was to suppress workers so that they could not resist the capitalist offensive. The devaluation of the pound has exposed the two-faced tactics of the leaders of the Trades Union Congress. At the conference on September 20, they cleverly decided to reserve criticism of the Labour government's actions on the devaluation of the pound. Some observers were surprised by this decision, while others recognized that those trade union leaders would not say anything, and still others predicted that the trade union leaders would have a very difficult attempt to force trade union members to support the government's policy.

Although currency devaluation has aroused public concern and resentment, it has not improved the international economic situation. The prices on the New York Stock Exchange fell sharply. On September 20, the total loss due to the drop in stock prices reached 100 billion yuan.

Of course, there is a class of capitalists in the United States, especially large monopolists, international bankers, and speculators, who will reap huge profits from currency devaluation. In countries where currencies have been devalued, the US dollar can buy more valuable things than before—real estate, stocks, factories, etc. In particular, arms manufacturers will buy strategic materials more cheaply than on the eve of the devaluation.

Currency devaluation makes it easier to implement Truman's announced strategy of increasing US foreign investment, and opens larger doors for US capital to invade the economies of other countries. American capitalists are buying up profitable enterprises. This makes the national industries of many countries even more tragic. The trade unions of France, Italy, and Britain correctly pointed out that factories and entire industries will be suffocated by American competition, and that unemployment will inevitably increase. Also, it must be remembered that Washington is trying to get countries to abolish tariff barriers to American goods, remove restrictions on American investment, and allow profits earned by Americans to be freely converted into US dollars (some of these American attempts have been successful, for example, these concessions have already been obtained from France).

Judging from these demands from the United States, the profits that this international financial measure of Wall Street will give to American monopolists are obviously very huge.

On the other hand, this measure, no matter how large its scale, obviously cannot solve the fundamental problems that the Marshall Plan cannot solve. When Cripps pretended that currency devaluation would help solve Britain's lack of US dollars, pretended that the reduction in the pound's exchange rate would make British goods cheaper, and therefore more competitive in foreign markets (especially in the American market), and pretended that this would increase export trade, and thus would bring US dollars into Britain, he was only deceiving the British working class.

These predictions can only be said to be hopes built on sand. It is only necessary to point out that Britain must use almost three times the export trade to compensate for the losses caused by the currency devaluation, by having to buy from the United States at high prices and export to the United States at low prices, to make it clear. British goods are relatively cheaper for customers using US dollars, but these goods will encounter increasing competition from other countries. The arguments of the British ministers are also being adopted by the ministers of other Marshallized countries: they are also hurrying to devalue the exchange rates of their currencies so that their goods can compete with British goods in foreign markets. These goods have already been suppressed to a cheaper price for American buyers, but how are their chances of entering the United States? As everyone knows, the United States has no intention of opening its market to British or any other goods. The simplest way to open the US market is to lower tariff barriers. However, there is no sign of this. The US economic crisis is becoming increasingly mature, and the US domestic market will only shrink, not expand.

Therefore, currency devaluation, under no circumstances, can free Britain or any other country from the dollar crisis.

The failure of the Marshall Plan has shattered America's hopes of maintaining maximum export trade and thus mitigating the blow of the crisis of overproduction. As far as Wall Street is concerned, currency devaluation is only a means of continuing to implement America's previous policy of establishing its dominant position in European and colonial markets.

Wall Street wants to recover from the workers of Western Europe the losses it has suffered in the economic crisis. American capitalists are now able to buy cheaper and sell dearer. The United States is building its economic relations with other capitalist countries on this basis. However, it is easy to understand that this method cannot solve the economic difficulties of these countries, but instead aggravates their economic difficulties; it cannot improve the economic relations between these countries and between them and the United States, but instead makes them more complicated.

Currency devaluation cannot prevent the approaching economic crisis, nor can it alleviate the antagonism of capitalism. On the contrary, the already serious struggle for markets will become more acute, the competition between countries will become more intense, the purchasing power of the people will be further reduced, and the crisis of the capitalist world will become more severe.

### 资本主义国家的货币贬值

　　资本主义国家的货币贬值
    石葛耶瓦著　孙治公译
    英国克里蒲斯与贝文以及美国艾奇逊与斯奈德之间在华盛顿举行的财政谈判，并未实现他们所作的恢复信心与安宁的诺言，而相反地是引致了一次财政方面的震动。九月十八日，英镑贬值成了事实。每英镑竟贬低了百分之三十以上，这显然是出乎国际交易市场的意料之外。目前每镑兑换二元八角美元，而不是四元零三分了。
    在这轻率的跌价情形底下，英镑拖累了不列颠各自治领，各殖民地，以及马歇尔计划各国和英镑区各国等底货币价值。在两三天之内，有二十三个资本主义国家，包括法兰西、加拿大、瑞典、荷兰、丹麦、芬兰、印度与意大利各国在内，都压低了他们的货币底汇兑率。这一浪潮，显然还会同样地波及其他的资本主义国家。股票交易和各种市场都陷于疯狂激动的状态。投机家预料到一种不可避免的物价高涨，他们都在买进商品，而梵蒂冈的代理人也在买进金币呢。
    这二十多种货币的贬值，是有重大的国际意义的事件，这一事件的无可计算的影响，在目前还未能完全确定。但是某些事实是很值得注意的。
    首先，十分显明的，贬值的一个直接和迫切的结果，就是物价和生活费用的高涨，并因而使劳动人民的生活水准更加恶化。英国在贬值的第二天，面包价格就提高了百分之三十，因为英国的小麦是从美国买来的。在马歇尔计划各国内，面包，煤，和烟草的涨价，还只是在开端。生活费用还要继续上涨。实际工资的降落，已经是一种事实，而且不是明天的事实，乃是今天的事实了。这样，华尔街和伦敦城的巨头们所长久思索的“减低生产成本”的计划，现在已经是由牺牲劳动阶级的利益而实行了。意大利的舆论在这一点上是极其坦直的。“呼声报”宣称：
    “货币的贬值，纯粹是、而且只是减低生产成本的代表而已，或者说得更恰当些，是达到减低生产成本的一种间接手段而已，因为单纯减低工人的工资底直接办法，是不能成功的。”
    “通讯报”和“时报”也公开说，借口“削减国内生产成本”以求“增加国外市场竞争力量”首先必须实行货币贬值，以抑低劳动阶级的生活水准。
    完全明显的，资本家由于国外市场竞争日益加剧和物价降落、加上用美元支付的原料和货品的高涨价格、使生产成本更高，而遭受的损失，他们是要从工人们身上取偿。
    我们知道，英国的工党大臣们早已主张牺牲劳动阶级来减低生产成本。他们获得职工会全国委员会之帮助而强付实行的冻结工资，禁止罢工的一贯政策，其目的何在，现在已很清楚了。
    美英统治者的许多不得人心的措施之中，货币贬值是打破纪录的。一切国家的人民和舆论，对于这一财政措施，都表示极度愤恨。
    在英国，英镑贬值的第一个结果是面包价格增高，预料在最近的将来一般生活费用都会大见增加。这一预料，在克里蒲斯对于贬值理由作第一次含混的解释时，他并未否认。这就引起了工会各分会纷纷反对。劳动群众怎样估计工党政府的行动，可由联合机器工会的巴罗英福尔尼斯第一分会的决议案见之。在那决议案里，称货币贬值为“对工人生活水准的凶恶侵害”。英国工人知道，美国的垄断资本和伦敦城之间已做了一可耻的交易，强制压低民众的生活水准，使英国垄断家可得到廉价劳力，而又便利美国资本侵入不列颠帝国。
    在这样的普遍愤恨与惊惶情况下，英国职工会领袖们竟默不作声。劳塞尔，狄景和杜森，在职工会大会上强迫通过一个决议案，此一决议案之目的在于压制工人使其对资本家的进攻不能加以反抗。英镑的贬值，已暴露了职工会全国委员会领袖们的两面派的战术。在九月二十日大会上，他们很聪明地决定对于工党政府的英镑贬值的行动，保留批判。有些观察家，对于这一决定，觉得惊异，另外一些人却认识到那些职工会领袖们是不会说什么的，还有一些人预料职工会领袖们将要很繁难地企图强迫工会会员们拥护政府的政策。
    货币贬值，虽然引起了民众的关心和愤恨，却并未使国际经济状况有所改进。纽约的证券交易的牌价，急剧地降落。九月二十日那天，由于股票价格的跌落，而致全部损失达十万万元之巨。
    当然的，美国有一类资本家，特别是大垄断家们、国际银行家们、和投机家们，是会由货币贬值而获得巨额利润。在货币贬了值的国家里，美元可以购得比以前更多的有价值的东西——不动产、股票、工厂等等。尤其是军火制造厂，会买到比在贬值前夜更廉价的战略物资。
    货币贬值使得杜鲁门所宣布要增加美国国外投资的策略更易于实行，并且替美国资本开了更大的门，以便其侵入别国的经济。美国的资本家正在收买有利润可得的企业。这使许多国家的民族工业更加悲哀。法兰西、意大利、和英国的职工会，正确地指出，工厂和全部工业将被美国的竞争所窒息，而且将使失业无可避免地日益增加。还有，须要记住，华盛顿正在设法使各国废止对于美货的关税壁垒，除去对于美国投资的限制，准许美国人所嫌得的利润可以自由兑换为美元（美国这些企图，已有部分成功了，例如已从法国得到了的这些让步）。
    从美国这些要求看来，华尔街的这一国际金融措施将给予美国垄断家们的利润，显然是很巨大的。
    另一方面，这一措施，不问其规模如何大，显然也不能解决马歇尔计划所不能解决的根本问题。当克里蒲斯佯称货币贬值会帮助解决英国缺乏美元的问题，佯称英镑汇兑率的减低会使英国货物更廉价，因而在国外市场（特别在美国市场）更有竞争力量，佯称这样会增进出口贸易，因而会使美元流入等语的时候，他只是在欺骗英国的劳动阶级而已。
    这些预料，仅能说是建立在散沙上的希望。只须指出，英国必须用差不多三倍的出口贸易来弥补那由于货币贬值、由于必须高价从美国购入而低价向美国输出所引起的损失，就清楚了。英国货物，对于用美元的顾客，是比较便宜了，但是这些货物将遇到其他国家日益增剧的竞争。英国大臣们的论据，其他马歇尔化国家的部长们也采用着：他们也赶快贬低其货币的汇兑率，以使他们的货物能在国外市场上与英国货竞争。这些货物，对于美国买主说，价钱是已经抑得更廉，但它们打入美国的机会怎样呢？正如大家所知道的，美国并无意开放它的市场给英国的或任何其他的货物。开放美国市场的最简单的方法，就是降低关税壁垒。然而这一件事毫无兆征。美国经济危机日益成熟，美国的国内市场只会紧缩，不会扩大。
    那么，货币的贬值，不论在任何情况下，都不能使英国或任何其他国家摆脱美元危机。
    马歇尔计划的失败，使美国希望保持最高限度的出口贸易因而缓和生产过剩危机底打击，落了一个空。就华尔街来说，货币贬值只是继续执行美国以前的在欧洲和殖民地市场建立其优越地位的政策底一种手段而已。
    华尔街要从西欧工人们身上取偿它在经济危机中所遭受的损失。美国资本家现在能够更廉买更贵卖了。美国正是在这基础上来建立其与别的资本主义国家的经济关系。然而很易了解这种办法并不能解决这些国家的经济困难，而反是加重其经济困难；不能改善这些国家相互间以及它们与美国间的经济关系，而反是使之更加复杂。
    货币贬值既不能阻止将临的经济危机，也不能缓和资本主义的敌对。相反，已经严重的争夺市场的斗争，反而将更加尖锐，各国的竞争反而将更加剧烈，民众的购买力将会更加低落，而资本主义世界的危机将更加剧。
