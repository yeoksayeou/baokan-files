Xinhua News Agency, South China Front, 26th: A unit of the People's Liberation Army Fourth Field Army liberated Liuzhou, Guangxi, at 11:00 on the 25th with a blitzkrieg maneuver. Within four days, from the 21st to the 24th, it also successively captured the three cities of Rongxian, Luocheng, and Si'en, north and northwest of Liuzhou. Babu, an industrial town north of Wuzhou, was also liberated at the same time. Liuzhou is located on the north bank of the Liujiang River, in the center of Guangxi Province. It is the hub of the Xiang-Gui Railway, with extremely convenient water and land transportation. Goods entering Guizhou from Guangdong and Guangxi, as well as rice, grain, cowhide, firewood, tung oil, and medicinal materials exported from the upper reaches of the Liujiang River and southern Guizhou, are all collected and distributed here. Industries include modern factories such as machinery, alcohol, cement, sulfuric acid, bricks, tiles, leather making, and dyeing and weaving, as well as sugar refining and silk reeling. Timber is particularly famous throughout the country.

Babu is located north of Wuzhou and is a newly emerging industrial town with nine tin mines, one coal mine, one chemical factory, and one electric light company, as well as more than 200 businesses. At the time of liberation, the employees automatically protected the factories, and the factories and mines were not damaged. The people's guerrillas active in the He (County), Xin (Du), and Huai (Ji) border areas cooperated with the main force to accept the surrender of the puppet county magistrate of He County, protect the mines in Babu, and maintain local security.

Xinhua News Agency, Southwest Front, 26th: The People's Liberation Army, advancing north along the Sichuan-Guizhou Road, liberated the two county towns of Meitan and Tongzi, east and north of Zunyi, successively on the 19th and 23rd of this month, annihilating one battalion of the enemy's 44th Army, killing and wounding and capturing about 50 enemies each.

Xinhua News Agency, Southwest Front, 26th: The People's Liberation Army, advancing west along the Sichuan-Hunan Highway, occupied Nanchuan County, southeast of Chongqing, at 20:00 on the 25th. The defending enemy fled towards Qijiang. On the 22nd, this unit of the People's Liberation Army intercepted and annihilated the directly subordinate team of the enemy's Second Army west of Wulong, capturing more than 1,000 people, seizing more than 100 mules and horses, and four mortars.

Xinhua News Agency, Southwest Front, 26th: The People's Liberation Army that liberated Guiyang advanced rapidly towards western Guizhou. On the 19th, it liberated the two counties of Anshun and Pingba, southwest of Guiyang, and on the 21st, it liberated Zhenning County. The entire engineering company of the enemy's 89th Army, 343rd Division, surrendered to us. On the 22nd, the People's Liberation Army continued to occupy Puding County. On the morning of the 23rd, the People's Liberation Army intercepted the fleeing enemy 49th Army, 249th Division, at Zhangguantun, west of Anshun. Except for a few who escaped, the entire division was annihilated by us. It is estimated that nearly 1,000 enemies were killed and wounded, and more than 1,000 officers and soldiers, including the 746th Regiment Commander Xia Minggui and the 745th Regiment Deputy Commander Wu Bangjie, were captured. Twenty-one mortars and 60mm guns, sixty-one light and heavy machine guns, more than 400 rifles, three radio stations, ninety-four war horses, and other military supplies were seized.
