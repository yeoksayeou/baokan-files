    North China University Russian Special Training Class
    Revised Admission Requirements
    [This Newspaper Reports] Since the North China University Russian Special Training Class began accepting applications a few days ago, many educated youths eager to learn Russian have been inquiring at the registration office at No. 1 Tieshizi Hutong. However, most of them have a solid foundation in English, German, or French, but have not studied Russian. To meet the demands of these prospective students, the university has revised the third requirement for admission: anyone with a solid foundation in English, German, or French, and who is determined to learn Russian, may apply even if they have not studied Russian. It is also reported that the Shanghai and Northeast examination areas of the university will also begin enrolling students in the coming days.

    华大俄文专修班
    修改投考资格
    【本报讯】华北大学俄文专修班自日前报名以来，要求学习俄文的知识青年纷纷前往该校铁狮子胡同一号报名处询问，但大多数皆系过去对英、德、法等文字有相当基础，而未学过俄文。该校为了满足投考青年的要求，特将投考资格第三条加以变更，凡对英、德、法文之一有相当基础而有决心学习俄文者，虽未学过俄文亦均可报考。又闻该校上海、东北两考区亦将于日内开始招生云。
