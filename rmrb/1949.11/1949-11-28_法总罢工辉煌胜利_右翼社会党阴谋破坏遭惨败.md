　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 27th. TASS, Paris, November 26th: Despite the provocative attitude of the leaders of the French Christian Workers' Confederation, the sabotage activities of some unions belonging to "Workers' Force," and the appeal from the Bidault government not to strike, all newspapers acknowledge that the 24-hour general strike on the 25th has achieved a brilliant victory.

　　Those involved in the strike included 100 percent of the subway and bus personnel, 95 percent of the railway employees, 90 percent of the steel and metal industry workers, 90 to 98 percent of the miners, 90 to 95 percent of the electricity and gas industry workers, about 95 percent of the construction workers, 80 percent of the educators, about 100 percent of the radio personnel, 100 percent of the journalists, almost 100 percent of the taxi drivers, and 90 percent of the social insurance employees. The General Confederation of Labor (CGT) called for unified action to secure the satisfaction of workers' demands, especially a subsidy of 3,000 francs per month. This call has received an extremely broad response.

　　The general strike once again exposed the double-dealing and treacherous policies of the French right-wing Socialist Party. For example, while the Socialist Party's Supreme Committee publicly claimed to "support" the strike, it was precisely these Socialist traitors who took measures to sabotage the strike. The Socialist Minister of Posts and Telecommunications, Thomas, circulated a letter to the directors of various post offices and telegraph offices, ordering them to compile a "blacklist" of strikers. With the support of another Socialist minister, Mocquet, all police and armed so-called security forces, as well as plainclothes detectives, were mobilized on the 25th, clearly with provocative intentions, and deployed near major enterprises throughout the country. The Minister of Public Works and Transport, the "Socialist" Pineau, "borrowed" several motorcycles and police from Mocquet in an attempt to undermine the strike of the Paris subway and bus workers. In some cities, the police attempted to create conflicts with the working people. However, all these provocative measures by the Socialist ministers failed.

　　The strike was well organized and successful. On the 25th, mass rallies were held throughout the country. These rallies were characterized by high morale. The rallies were held under the slogans of "further struggle to satisfy the fundamental demands of the working people" and "strengthening the unity of action."

　　法总罢工辉煌胜利
  　右翼社会党阴谋破坏遭惨败
    【新华社北京二十七日电】塔斯社巴黎二十六日讯：尽管法国基督教工人联盟的领导者抱着挑拨的态度，某些属于“工人力量”的工会进行破坏罢工的活动，以及皮杜尔政府发出不要罢工的呼吁，可是，一切报纸均承认二十五日二十四小时的总罢工已获得辉煌的胜利。
    此次卷入罢工者，有百分之百的地下铁道和公共汽车的人员，百分之九十五的铁路员工，百分之九十的钢铁和金属工业的工人，百分之九十至九十八的矿工，百分之九十至九十五的电力和煤气工业工人，约百分之九十五的建筑业工人，百分之八十的教育工作者，约百分之百的广播人员，百分之百的新闻从业员，几及百分之百的出租汽车司机和百分之九十的社会保险业从业员。总工会曾号召统一行动，争取满足工人的要求，特别是每月三千法郎的津贴。这个号召已获得极为广泛的响应。
    总罢工再度暴露了法国右翼社会党的两面派和叛卖的政策。例如，社会党最高委员会一面扬言“支持”罢工，但是，采取破坏罢工措施的，也正是这些社会党的叛徒们。社会党的邮电部长多玛斯，通函各邮政局和电信局的局长，命令他们编造罢工者的“黑名单”。在另一个社会党部长莫克援意之下，一切警察和武装的所谓保安队，还有便衣警探，都在二十五日那天动员起来，显然抱着挑衅的目的，公布在全国各大企业的附近。公共工程及运输部长“社会主义者”比诺，向莫克“借”了几部摩托车和警察，企图破坏巴黎地下铁道和公共汽车工人的罢工。在某些城市里，警察曾企图制造与劳动人民的冲突。但是，一切这些社会党部长的挑拨措施都失败了。
    罢工组织得很好，而且是成功的。在二十五日，全国各地都举行了群众大会。这些大会的特点是高涨的情绪。大会是在“为满足劳动人民的根本要求而进行更进一步的斗争”和“加强行动的统一”等口号之下举行的。
