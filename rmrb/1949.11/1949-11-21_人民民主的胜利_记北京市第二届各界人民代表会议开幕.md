　　The Victory of People's Democracy
　　——On the Opening of the Second Session of the Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference
　　Feng Zhong
　　The people of Beijing have begun to directly manage their own political power. Chairman Mao once instructed at the first session of the All-Circles Representatives Conference in Beiping: "Once conditions are ripe, the current All-Circles People's Representative Conference can exercise the functions of the People's Congress, become the highest organ of power in the city, and elect the municipal government. As far as the situation in Beiping is concerned, this can be done in about a few months." The people of Beijing enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's call and made meticulous preparations in all aspects. Three months and six days after the closing of the previous All-Circles Representatives Conference—on November 20th—the second session of the Beijing Municipal All-Circles People's Representative Conference officially opened. This conference will elect the mayor, deputy mayors, and members of the municipal government. Of the 424 representatives, in addition to government representatives and party representatives, there are also workers, farmers, the People's Liberation Army, industrialists and businessmen, women, youth, students, teachers, medical workers, journalists, cooperative representatives, literary and art circles representatives, representatives of the families of martyrs and soldiers, representatives of ethnic minorities such as Hui, Mongolian, and Tibetan people, as well as democratic figures from Islam, Christianity, Buddhism, Catholicism, and Lamaism, and specially invited patriotic democratic figures from all walks of life. The breadth of representation at this conference is unprecedented. The thorough preparation of the conference made it lively, compact, vibrant, and orderly, and the content was even more substantial. The representatives attending the meeting all felt the joy of new progress and victory, which further enhanced their confidence. As written on the red banner presented to the conference by the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, this is "The Victory of People's Democracy."
　　The venue—Zhongshan Hall in Zhongshan Park—was newly decorated, glowing with red light. Every representative walked into the venue with a smile on their face. Secretary-General Xue Zizheng announced the opening of the meeting, and the mercury lamps illuminated the entire venue. Chairman Peng Zhen emphasized in his opening speech that continuing to restore and develop production is the overriding task for the future, and only with the development of production can all tasks have a foundation. After the conference smoothly passed the "Organizational Regulations of the Second Session of the Beijing Municipal All-Circles People's Representative Conference," the representatives listened attentively, word by word, to Mayor Nie Rongzhen's report on the Beijing Municipal People's Government's implementation of the resolutions of the first session of the All-Circles People's Representative Conference, as well as the future work guidelines and plans. Of the 171 resolutions passed by the previous All-Circles Representatives Conference and submitted to the municipal government for handling or reference, by the end of October, in just two and a half months, except for seven proposals such as "establishing public bathhouses," the remaining 164 proposals had been implemented separately, taking into account the urgency of each matter. This situation eloquently proves how responsible the people's government is to the people! Many representatives recalled that meetings were also often held during the Kuomintang rule, but the representatives at that time were all "for official use only," and the result of the meetings was always "meeting without discussion, discussion without decision, and decision without implementation." Since the closing of the previous All-Circles Representatives Conference, in just over three months, Beijing's work has made rapid progress in all aspects: after suppressing the activities of counter-revolutionary elements, revolutionary order has become more and more consolidated day by day. In October, eleven of the city's twenty public security sub-bureaus did not experience any robbery cases within their borders; public and private factories throughout the city are gradually recovering and developing. For example, the production of the state-owned Yanjing Paper Mill and the newly built Glass Factory has reduced costs, improved quality, and greatly increased sales volume. Some private factories in the weaving and dyeing, soap making, and knitting industries have implemented joint operations and joint sales to reduce costs; another portion of commercial capital has also shifted to production. The achievements in cultural and educational work are also quite remarkable. The number of classes added specifically for workers' children in primary and secondary schools and vocational schools has enrolled more than 10,000 new students, and more than 600 children's literacy classes have been established, with more than 18,000 children enrolled. Ninety-six adult literacy schools also have more than 5,700 students; more than 100 adult literacy classes have also been established in the suburbs. Everyone has personally witnessed the situation of urban construction. Several main roads, such as Chaoyangmen Avenue, Guang'anmen Avenue, and Xuanwumen Avenue, have been paved with asphalt, and most of the uneven roads have been repaired. We can often hear people pulling rickshaws and riding bicycles on these streets gratefully saying: "It's so pleasant to ride on these roads!" There are also health stations and mobile medical teams in the suburbs, and the municipal hospital has implemented preferential treatment for poor workers, providing free or reduced fees; more than 1,780 unemployed workers and citizens have been helped by the government to go to Chahar, Inner Mongolia, and Fushun to participate in production... The people's government's implementation of the resolutions of the All-Circles Representatives Conference and the things it has done for the people cannot be fully described in a short time.
　　Mayor Nie gave a special supplementary report on the issue of price fluctuations since November. He analyzed the causes of the fluctuations, announced the government's measures, and firmly affirmed: the government will definitely guarantee the supply of grain and coal in Beijing and prevent shortages. Grain will be directly supplied to citizens. The number of institutions, schools, and citizens currently receiving direct supply is 600,000, and preparations are being made to expand it to 1.2 million.
　　Mayor Nie's report further strengthened the people's trust in the government. After the meeting, people's representatives could be heard everywhere discussing: "This is truly a government responsible to the people."

　　人民民主的胜利
　　——记北京市第二届各界人民代表会议开幕
　　冯仲
    北京市人民已开始直接管理自己的政权了。毛主席在第一届北平各界代表会议上曾经指示：“一俟条件成熟，现在方式的各界人民代表会议即可执行人民代表大会的职权，成为全市的最高权力机关，选举市政府。以北平情况来说，大约几个月后就可以这样做了。”北京市的人民热烈响应毛主席的号召，从各方面作了周密的准备工作，在上届各界代表会议闭幕后的三个月零六天——十一月二十日，北京市第二届各界人民代表会议正式揭幕了。这次会议要选举市长、副市长和市政府委员。在四百二十四名代表中除政府代表和党派代表外，包括工人，农民，解放军，工商业者，妇女，青年，学生，教员，医务工作者，新闻工作者，合作社代表，文艺界代表，烈属军属代表，回民、蒙民、藏民等少数民族代表，以及回教、基督教、佛教、天主教、喇嘛教的民主人士和特邀的各界爱国民主人士。这次会议的代表性的广泛是空前的。会议的准备充分更使它表现了热烈紧凑，生气勃勃而有条不紊，内容也更充实。与会的代表都感到获得新的进步和胜利之后的愉快，更加提高了信心。正如中共北京市委会送给大会的红帐子上所写的，这是“人民民主的胜利”。
    会场——中山公园中山堂内外布置一新，泛着一片红光。每一个代表都满脸笑容的走进了会场。薛子正秘书长宣布开会，水银灯强烈的光照亮了全场。主席彭真同志在开幕辞中着重指出：继续恢复和发展生产为今后压倒一切的任务，只有生产发展了，各项工作才有一个基础。会议顺利地通过了“北京市第二届各界代表会议组织条例”之后，代表们聚精会神一字一句地倾听聂荣臻市长关于北京市人民政府执行第一届各界人民代表会议决议案的情况及今后工作方针与计划的报告。上届各界代表会议通过交市政府办理或参考的决议案共一百七十一件，到十月底为止，仅仅两个半月中，除“设立公营澡堂”等七个议案以外，其余一百六十四案都已斟酌缓急先后，分别执行了。这种情况雄辩地证明了人民的政府对人民是如何的负责啊！许多代表回想起国民党统治时期也常开会，那时候的代表全是“御用”的，会议的结果总是“会而不议，议而不决，决而不行”。上届各界代表会议闭幕后，仅仅三个多月的时间，北京市的工作在各方面都有了迅速的进展：经镇压反革命分子活动后，革命秩序一天天更加巩固了。十月份全市廿个公安分局中有十一个分局境内没有发生过抢案；全市公私营工厂都正逐步地恢复与发展，如公营燕京造纸厂、新建玻璃厂的生产都减低了成本、提高了质量、销货量大大增加。私营的织染、造胰、针织各业部分工厂已实行联营联销，借以减低成本；另有一部分商业资金也转向了生产。文化教育工作的成绩也相当显著，在中小学中专为工人子弟增加的班次，已招收新生一万多人，普设了六百多个儿童识字班，已经有一万八千多儿童入班学习。九十六处成人补习学校也有了学生五千七百多人；郊区又成立了一百多个成人补习班。都市建设的情况是人人都亲眼看到了的。几条干线马路，象朝阳门大街、广安门大街、宣武门大街都已铺装了沥青路面，不平的路大部修补好了。我们在这几条大街上常可以听到拉三轮和骑自行车的人们感激的说：“在这马路上骑车，多么痛快！”郊区也有了卫生站和巡回医疗队，市立医院已实行了优待贫苦工人免费减费办法；失业工人和市民经政府帮助到察北、内蒙、抚顺去参加生产的已有一千七百八十余人……人民的政府执行各界代表会议的决议，替人民办的事一时是无法说完的。
    聂市长特别对十一月以来的物价波动问题作了补充报告，他分析了波动的原因，宣布了政府的措施，并且坚决肯定的说：政府一定保证北京市粮煤供给不使缺乏，粮食要直接供给市民，现在直接供给的机关、学校、市民已有六十万人，正准备发展到一百二十万人。
    聂市长的报告更加强了人民对政府的信任，散会后到处可以听到人民的代表们在谈论：“这真是对人民负责的政府”。
