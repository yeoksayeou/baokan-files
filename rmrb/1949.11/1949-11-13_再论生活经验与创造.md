Re-discussing Life Experience and Creation
　　Wang Chaowen

You think the theory of familiarizing oneself with life has become an old tune, with nothing to fuss about. As far as you are concerned, this issue has not been resolved. Judging from your conceptualized creations, you still do not understand this old tune. Not practicing this old tune will not help with creation, nor will it allow you to understand its true meaning.

You believe that Michelangelo's sculptural creations feel so natural – not artificially carved, their images seem to be carved from within the stone, as if they were originally growing in the stone – the reason is that he had a clear idea in mind. This is correct. But where does this clear idea come from? It is rarely clearly investigated, right? People often think that Michelangelo's success lies in his genius, but interpreting genius as innate ability is undoubtedly a prejudice. People neglect or intentionally conceal a very ordinary truth: the decisive role of life experience in creation and the growth of genius. Consequently, they intentionally or unintentionally block the source of creation and hinder their own progress. Whether examining realistically powerful works from any period or region, can their success be separated from real life? It cannot.

According to Ernst Grosse's research on the art of primitive peoples, he believes that the excellent artistic images of these primitive peoples are due to their great familiarity with the objects they depict. (Regardless of his research methods on the origin of art, certain opinions are valuable. Unfortunately, these opinions are not valued by the so-called artists of his class's declining stage, who dare not face reality. Is it not seen that anti-realistic formalism "works" are still rampant in America, which considers itself cultured but is actually causing cultural decline?) Grosse believes that no matter how crude the art of primitive peoples is, those images are full of life and very real. "This is often not found in the carefully considered imagery of many advanced nations." The author continues to believe that the reason why primitive peoples are able to depict those wild beasts so realistically and vividly is because they are very familiar with those wild beasts. "Even if living in the richest hunting areas, if primitive hunters do not have precise knowledge and observational abilities regarding the nature and habits of many wild beasts, they will still gain nothing." He also cites many amazing examples of the keen senses and observational abilities, as well as memory, of Australian aborigines, Bushmen, or Arctic aborigines. (Such as unerringly finding traces of squirrels jumping on the bark of trees, and being able to distinguish between new and old traces, whether they jumped from above or below, etc. Needless to say, these senses and observational abilities are forged by the needs of life.) The high degree of mimicry of animals such as kangaroos displayed in dancing is also due to a high degree of familiarity with the objects being mimicked. Interestingly, the subjects appearing in the paintings and sculptures of these so-called primitive peoples are mostly wild beasts, fish, kangaroos, and battles, while subjects such as plants are almost never found. This also illustrates the decisive role of the particularity of the life experience of a nation that lives by hunting rather than by animal husbandry or agriculture. - Because of the weak connection of plants to their lives, they are less concerned with them and have less knowledge of them. Taking animal subjects as an example, the Bushmen paint cattle, sheep, horses, and elephants, while the Eskimos carve seals, salmon, etc. It goes without saying that this is further proof of being limited by specific lives. If you do not reject this not-so-new truth, we can find a realistic basis for the tenderness and loving expression of the imagined Madonna and Child, and we can understand why art workers who have not attended art school but have lived in the army for a long time can depict vivid images of capturing prisoners so effortlessly.

You ask, some art workers in the old liberated areas did not necessarily participate in front-line battles, but they can still depict battles quite vividly. Doesn't that just prove the correctness of the principle that "one does not have to be a prostitute or murderer to depict the psychology of prostitutes and murderers"? Although you raise this question as a question, the way the question is raised fully exposes a view that despises life experience. Rather than wanting to delve into this issue, it is better to say that you refuse to delve into this issue. Those artists who did not directly participate in battles but also depicted battles well, always have appropriate indirect life experience as a basis. This experience cannot be obtained under any historical or environmental conditions. It is experienced and provided by comrades-in-arms of the same era and the same environment. Regarding Shirakaba Kusata's principle that one does not have to personally experience theft and adultery to depict these things, Lu Xun once gave partial recognition and also gave a correct correction:

"...I think this is because the writer grew up in the old society, is familiar with the situation of the old society, and is accustomed to the characters of the old society, so he can empathize. Regarding the situation and characters of the proletariat, with whom he has always had no relationship, he will be incompetent or make erroneous descriptions. Therefore, revolutionary literary artists must at least share their lives with the revolution or deeply feel the pulse of the revolution..."

Lu Xun's view is consistent with the principle emphasized by Comrade Mao Zedong that revolutionary literary artists must throw themselves into the fiery struggle of the masses in order to truly understand life. Facts have proven that without doing so, one cannot understand the character of these brand-new characters. To say nothing else, their initiative and creativity can never be replaced by the blind obedience and passive character of the soldiers of the counter-revolutionary army. The reason why those works in the old liberated areas can vividly portray the new heroes and deeply reflect the new reality cannot but be attributed to their efforts in new life practice. Even if those works are still crude, they are bought with blood, with life. (Some authors have already sacrificed on the battlefield.) If one does not fight alongside the People's Liberation Army, it is difficult or even impossible to understand the new qualities of the People's Liberation Army. The characteristics of those new heroes who are not afraid of self-sacrifice and have lofty ideals of collectivism can never be imagined solely based on news reports. Just talking about the progress of the liberated soldiers, to truly understand the specific process of a prisoner transforming into a hero, without participating in the troops' grievance-airing and merit-making movements, one would hardly believe in the reality of this transformation, let alone vividly depict them. Then, why can art workers who do not directly participate in battles depict battles quite vividly?

Emphasizing participation in actual life, of course, does not fundamentally negate the role of indirect life experience. It is not to say that, besides personal experience, materials such as interviews with participating soldiers have no value, nor is it to say that successful depictions of battle dramas and novels have no value as materials for composing new images, nor is it to say that one cannot fundamentally obtain certain supplements to new images from movies, photographs, and news reports. The question is whether these indirect life experiences come from new real life. The utilization of this indirect life experience is basically not separated from the new real life. From this, it can be seen that one does not necessarily have to participate in battles to depict soldiers, because this indirect life experience is exactly in line with the needs of the new theme.

Of course, personal life experience is relatively narrow compared to the vast reality. In order to be both deep and broad, one cannot close the door and refuse to accept or despise indirect life experience. But even for the sake of broad understanding, one must have some depth. Without depth in a certain area, it is difficult to make effective comparative studies in other areas, and breadth will not be achieved. Because without an in-depth understanding of a certain aspect, the understanding of other aspects will be superficial. The generalizing effect and profundity of images are inseparable.

Furthermore, why should we unconditionally participate in the actual struggle of the masses?

There is no question that, whether treating direct or indirect life experience, one should be aware that one is an artist, not a political worker. But this attention is mainly during creation, not during living. This attention is not equivalent to negating unconditional participation in the life of the masses. The basic point of divergence between conditional and unconditional is whether one is serving the masses wholeheartedly for personal fame and gain. Participating in actual life with the identity of an artist does not fundamentally overthrow the principle of unconditional. However, it is not to say that artists can have special ways of participating in actual life. Some people believe that the instructor only needs to understand the general situation of the climax of soldiers' combat enthusiasm. Artists and other artists cannot stop at a general understanding. In order to depict the image, they must feel and understand how the soldiers' emotions are high, and what details this high enthusiasm is specifically expressed in. On the surface, this seems very reasonable, but in fact, it does not understand the commonality between the two. If the political instructor does not understand the specific emotions of the soldiers, how can he properly command the specific soldiers? If the artist does not understand the general situation, how can he create a universal type? If, when the artist participates in the battle, he observes from the sidelines as a painter, it is impossible to intimately experience the enthusiasm of the combatants, and therefore it is impossible to truly vividly depict their appearance. Even if one is holding a gun and charging, not concentrating on the intense battle will not only harm the battle, but also make it impossible to truly experience the tension of the battle emotions, and of course, it will not be possible to depict a truly tense appearance. Needless to say, artists must focus on recognizing how these emotions are expressed in visible, tangible actions, postures, and expressions. They must grasp the appearance that reveals their psychological characteristics, and they must make sketches and record materials, even compositions, when they are not in a tense situation. According to the special tasks of the artist, there should be a preference under the general requirements, otherwise, the creation is still easy to fall into the desperate situation of conceptualization. However, the overall road is the same. At the critical juncture of struggle or work, one must participate in the work as an ordinary soldier. Of course, we cannot have a mechanical understanding of unconditional participation in actual life, but we cannot be so flexible as to cancel this principle. - Looking at life from a third-person perspective, and therefore not quite correctly understanding life.

Finally, let us discuss the issue of the disconnection between life and creation.

You take the fact that some people who have lived among workers, peasants, and soldiers for a long time cannot create extraordinary works of art as a negation of the important significance of life practice. This is a biased view. Not only is the contradiction between unconditional participation and being aware of oneself as an art worker understood as an irreconcilable contradiction, but the principle that the resolution of this contradiction is mainly in the creative process rather than in the living process is not understood. Moreover, in essence, it is fundamentally believed that it is unimportant whether one participates in actual life or not. This view is dangerous. It will hinder you from achieving the ideal of becoming a truly realistic art worker. Why do you have this view? Mainly, there is a lack of sincerity in serving the people, and at the same time, it is related to your technical views, to your preference for the decadent formalism "masterpieces" of the bourgeoisie, and to your one-sided way of looking at problems - not examining the specific reasons why a certain person cannot produce extraordinary works, not understanding whether living in the liberated area is equivalent to being familiar with actual life. You ignore the fact that many good works have been produced due to actual life experience. Taking the secondary reason that "participating in actual life does not produce good works" as a defense for staying in a small studio, allowing this view to run wild, it is not new art that fails, but oneself.

The principle of having to participate in actual life is ordinary, but it is also extraordinary. As you said, "It has already been resolved in the documents." Does the resolution in the documents mean that you have already resolved it yourself? There is still a need for reconsideration. As long as you acknowledge this ordinary principle not in words but in deeds, I am willing to admit that this letter is superfluous.

    再论生活经验与创造
    王朝闻
    你认为熟悉生活的理论已成老调，没有什么噜苏的必要。于你说来，这问题并未解决。从你那些概念化的创作看来，你还不懂得这老调。不实践这老调无补于创作，同时也不能懂得这老调的真正意义。
    你认为：米格南基罗的雕刻创作使人感到那样自如——不是人工的刻起来的，其形象是从石头里面刻出来的，好象它本来已经长在石块当中——其原因是胸有成竹，这是对的。但这成竹从何而来，很少明确的加以推究吧？人常以为米格南基罗的成功，在于他的天才，但把天才解释为天赋的能力，不能不说是一种偏见。人忽略了或有意掩盖着一个很平常的道理：生活经验对于创作以及天才成长之决定作用。因而有意无意堵塞了创造之泉源，妨碍了自己的进步。不论从那一时期那一地区的现实性强烈的作品加以考察，其成功离得开现实生活吗？不能的。
    根据格罗塞（Ｅｒｎｓｔ Ｇｒｏｉｓｅ）研究原始民族艺术的结果，他认为这些原始民族之优异的艺术形象，因为他们非常熟悉其所描写的对象的缘故。（不论他对美术起源之研究方法如何，某些意见是可贵的，这种意见可惜不为他本阶级没落阶段的、不敢正视现实的所谓艺术家所重视，岂不见反现实之形式主义的“作品”至今还在自以为有文化、实质上是使文化衰颓的美国嚣张着吗？）格罗塞认为：无论原始民族艺术如何粗糙，但那些形象富有生命，非常真实。“这往往是许多高级民族的慎重推敲的造象中见不到的”。作者继而认为：原始民族之所以能够特别真实而又生动的描写那些野兽的原因，由于他们非常熟悉那些野兽。“即使生活在最丰富的狩猎区域，假如原始狩猎者对于许多野兽的性质和习惯没有精确了解的知识和观察能力，也仍旧会一无所获的。”他并引证了许多澳洲土人，布须曼人或北极土人的锐敏感觉和观察能力以及记忆力的惊人的例子。（如象毫不错误的从树皮上找出松鼠跳过的痕迹，而且能够辩别是新痕旧痕，从上跳或从下跳之类。不用说这些感觉和观察力缘于生活需要所锻练出来的。）在跳舞上所显示的对于袋鼠之类的动物的高度的摩拟能力，也由高度熟悉所摩拟的对象的缘故。有趣的是：出现在这些所谓原始民族的绘画和雕刻中的题材，绝大多数是野兽、鱼、袋鼠、以及战斗，而植物之类的题材几乎完全发现不出来。这也说明以狩猎为生而不是以畜牧或农业为生的民族的生活经验之特殊性的决定作用。——因为值物对于生活关系的淡泊，所以就较不关心也较少认识。就以兽类题材而论，布须曼人画的是牛、羊、马、象。而挨斯基摩人刻的是海豹、鲑鱼之类，不消说更是受了特定的生活所限制的证明。如果这种并不新鲜的道理不被你所摈弃，我们可以给虽是想象的圣母子之温柔、慈爱的表情找到现实的根据，可以理解虽然没有上过美术学校而由于长期生活在部队中的美术工作者，为什么能够那样不吃力的描出了捉俘虏之类的生动的形象。
    你问，老解放区有些美术工作者并不一定参加前线的战斗，但也仍能相当生动的描写战斗，那难道不是恰好证明“不是妓女和杀人犯也可以描写妓女和杀人犯之心理”的道理之正确吗？你虽然把这问题当问题提出，但问题的提法就充分暴露着轻视生活经验的观点。与其说是想深究这一问题，勿宁说是拒绝深究这一问题。那些并未直接参加战斗但也描写得好战斗的艺术家，总有适当的间接生活经验作根据，这种经验也不是任何历史条件环境条件所能获得。而是同一时代与同一环境的战友们所经历的并供给他们的。关于厨川白村的不必亲自体验偷盗和通奸也能描写这些的道理，鲁迅曾经给予部分的承认，也给与正确的修正：
    “……我以为，这是作家生长在旧社会里，熟悉了旧社会的情形，看惯了旧社会的人物的缘故，所以他能体察；对于和他向来没有关系的无产阶级的情形，人物，他就会无能，或者弄成错误的描写了。所以革命文学家，至少必须和革命共同着生命，或深切的感受着革命的脉搏……”
    鲁迅这种见解，和毛泽东同志强调的认为革命文学家与艺术家必须投身到群众火热的斗争中去才能够真正认识生活的原则是一致的。事实证明，不如此就不能认识这些崭新的人物的性格。单说他们的积极性与创造性决不是反革命军队的士兵之盲从与被动的性格所可以代替。那些老解放区的作品之所以能够生动的刻划出新的英雄，也深刻的反映了新的现实，不能不归功于他们对于新的生活实践的努力。那些作品即令尚嫌粗糙，也是用血换来的，用生命换来的。（有的作者已经牺牲在战场。）如果不和解放军一同战斗，就很难甚至根本不能懂得解放军的新品质，那样不惜自我牺牲的具有崇高理想的集体主义的新英雄的特征，决不是单靠新闻报导的材料所能想象。仅就解放战士的进步而论，要想真切的理解一个俘虏变英雄的具体过程，不参加部队的诉苦运动立功运动几乎不会相信这种转变的现实性，更不用说生动的描写他们了。那末，到底不直接参加战斗的美术工作者，为什么能够相当生动的描写战斗呢？
    强调参加实际生活，当然不是根本否定了间接的生活经验的作用。不是说，除了亲身体验之外的，从参战的士兵的访问之类的材料就毫无价值，不是说，成功的描写战斗之剧本和小说没有作为组成新形象之素材的价值，不是说根本不可以从电影，照片以及新闻记事取得新形象之某些补充，问题在于这些间接生活经验是不是来自新的生活实际，这种间接生活经验的利用，基本上没有脱离新的实际生活。由此可见，不一定参加过战斗也能描写战士，因为这间接生活经验恰合新主题的需要。
    当然喽，个人的生活经验比较起广阔的现实来说，是狭小的，为了既深且广，不能关门主义的拒绝接受或轻视间接的生活经验，但就是为了认识的广阔，也必须有所深入，没有某方面的深入，也就很难对其他方面作有效的比较研究，要广阔也不成。因为没有某一方面之深入的理解，对于其他方面的理解就会肤浅。形象的概括作用与深刻性是分不开的。
    此外，为什么说要无条件的参加群众实际斗争呢？
    不成问题，不论是对待直接的或间接的生活经验，应该意识到自己是美术家而不是政治工作者。但这种注意，主要的在创作的时候，而不是在生活的时候。这种注意，不等于否定无条件的参加群众生活。有条件与无条件，基本的分歧点在于是为个人名利还是全心全意为群众服务；以美术家身份来参加实际生活并不是根本推翻了无条件这原则。但是，也并不是说美术家参加实际生活时可以有特殊的方式方法。有人认为：指导员对于战士的战斗热情的高潮的情况，只须了解其一般概况就行，美术家及其他艺术家就不能止于一般概况的了解，为了形象的描写他们，必须感受认识战士们的情绪如何高涨着，这高涨的热情具体表现在那些细节上面。从表面看，这似乎很有道理，其实不懂得二者之间的共通性。政治指导员如果不了解具体的战士之情绪，如何能够适当指挥具体的战士，美术家如果不理解一般概况，如何能够创造有普遍性的典型？假如说，美术家参加战斗的时候，从旁以画家的身份作观察，决不可能亲切的体会战斗者的热情，因而也不能真正生动的刻划其外貌。即令是自己拿枪冲锋，不集中注意于紧张的战斗，不仅会损害战斗，也不可能真正体会战斗情绪的紧张，当然就刻划不出真正紧张的外貌来的。不用说，美术家必须着重的认识这些情绪如何表现在可视的有形的行动、身姿、表情上面，必须把握显示其心理特征的外貌，而且在不是紧张的情况下，必须作速写和记录材料，甚至构图，根据美术家的特殊任务，在总的要求下应当有所偏重，不然其创作仍易陷入概念化的绝境。但是，总的道路是一致的。在斗争或工作的紧要关头，必须以一个普通的战士来参加工作。我们对于无条件的参加实际生活当然不能作机械的了解，但也不能灵活到取消这一原则的程度。——以第三者角度来看待生活、因而就不太正确的认识生活。
    最后，我们来讨论一个生活与创作之脱节问题。
    你把某些长期生活在工农兵中而不能创作非凡的美术品的事实，作为否定生活实践之重要意义，这是偏颇的看法。不仅对于无条件参加与意识着自己是美术工作者的矛盾理解为不相容的矛盾，不理解这矛盾的解决主要在创作过程中而不是在生活着的时候的道理，而且实质上根本认为参加不参加实际生活无关紧要。这种看法是危险的。他将妨碍你达到成为真正现实主义美术工作者之理想。为什么会有这种看法呢？主要的，为人民服务的诚意不足，同时这和你的技术观点有关，这和你偏爱沉落的资产阶级之形式主义的“名作”有关，这和你片面看问题的思想方法有关，——不从某一个人为什么不能制出非凡作品的具体原因加以考察，不明白生活在解放区是不是等于熟悉实际生活？你置很多由于有实际生活经验而搞出好作品的事实于不顾。把“参加实际生活也搞不出好作品”的枝节理由来作为停留在小画室中的辩护，放任这种看法，失败的不是新美术而是自己。
    必须参加实际生活的道理是平凡的，但也不凡。如你所说，“文件上早已解决过了。”文件上的解决是不是等于自己已经解决？还有重新考虑的必要。只要你不是在口头上而是在行动上承认这平凡道理，我愿意承认这封信是多余的。
