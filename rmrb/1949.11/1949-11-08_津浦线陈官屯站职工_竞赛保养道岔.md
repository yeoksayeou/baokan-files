Chen Guantun Station Employees on the Jinpu Line
　Compete to Maintain Switches
　　[Our Newspaper] The employees of Chen Guantun Station on the Jinpu Line have achieved excellent results in the switch maintenance competition, and have been praised by the Railway Bureau. Zhao Yuqi, the newly appointed station master, issued a call for switch maintenance and cleaning of lights the day after taking office, convened a meeting of all station employees, established an inspection team, and planned to complete the work in ten days. The switchmen were in high spirits, and after a full discussion, they proposed a plan to complete it in four days. By the fourth day, the switch at the north end of the station was better maintained than the one at the south end. The employees at the south end immediately doubled their efforts, working overtime and staying late, refusing to rest until the job was done, and as a result, they surpassed the north end. The north and south ends challenged each other and also issued challenges to other stations along the line. The station master, deputy station master, and office staff all participated. Signalman Hu Guisan brought his younger brother to the station to help with the work, and during the work, he discovered that brick powder could be used instead of sandpaper, reducing expenses. After wiping with brick powder, polishing with a worn shoe sole made it bright and shiny. Another feature of this competition was its widespread mobilization. Everyone in the station did a good job on all the switches, even cleaning the invisible cracks. At the same time, they also repaired the gray pillars of the switches along the edges of the line.

　　津浦线陈官屯站职工
  　竞赛保养道岔
    【本报讯】津浦线陈官屯全站职工发展保养道岔竞赛成绩良好，获得路局表扬。该站新任站长赵毓岐到任后第二天，即发出养岔清洁灯器号召，召集全站职工会议，成立检查组，计划十天完成。特别转辙工情绪很高，经全体讨论提出四天完成计划。进行到第四天，站北头转辙器比站南头保养得好。南头职工，即加倍努力，不歇班、晚下班，不做好不肯休息，结果超过了北头。南北头互相挑战，又向全线各站发出挑战书。站长、副站长、内勤职工均一齐出动。号志工胡贵三把自己弟弟带到站上帮助工作，工作中研究出用砖末代替砂纸，减少开支。用砖末擦完再用破鞋底磨擦，又亮又光。在这竞赛中，另一个特点是发动得很普遍，全站岔子，人人都做得好，连看不见的夹缝内也弄得干干净净，同时也把路线边缘转辙器灰柱都补筑完整。
