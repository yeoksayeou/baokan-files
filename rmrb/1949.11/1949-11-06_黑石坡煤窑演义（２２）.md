However, Yu Bao was different from Da San. He didn't set rules and regulations for inside and outside the mine like Da San, and he didn't often go down to the mine bottom. He mostly relied on Tai Cheng, the idle foreman, or listened to Niu Bao about the operations at the mine bottom and the situation of the miners. If he saw anyone doing something wrong, he would scold them or deduct two days' pay. The miners didn't like to argue with him, so nothing major happened. Xi Lu occasionally went down to the mine bottom, and Qian Danao would also come to the mine to take a look if he happened to be free. Ju Bao even came twice, laughing and saying, "Ha! Hard work! How is it? Is everything going smoothly? Good! Remember! This is a major event related to our village, our community, and our family name! Work hard!" At this time, Yu Bao would gesture and talk, flattering him for a while, and then send him away. Then he would go down to the mine bottom and shout, "Old man Ju Bao came to see us! He sends his regards to everyone and tells you to work hard and not to fool around! This is a major event for our whole village! Remember that?" After shouting, he would come up and rest for a while, and the miners would mostly hand over the work to the idle foreman and go to Niu Bao's sister-in-law's place to sleep soundly.

In another two months or so, the new mine was progressing smoothly. On the eighteenth day of the twelfth lunar month, the day when the mines in this area stopped work to settle accounts and pay respects to the Old Lord, Yu Bao and Xi Lu settled the accounts. Not bad! Although the coal production wasn't as much as last year, it wasn't too far off. However, the labor and advance capital spent on opening the new mine were less than Da San had planned. Xi Lu was very happy and became even bolder, his enthusiasm for expanding the mine growing stronger and stronger. Ju Bao also congratulated Xi Lu and suggested that the mine release free coal for three days at the end of the year, allowing everyone in the village to carry it away as they pleased. He also suggested that Xi Lu put on three days of opera during the New Year and Lantern Festival, and said that he would also be happy to contribute some money. Seeing that the mine had great prospects, Xi Lu figured that the loan he borrowed from Ju Bao was due in February of the following year, and he would have a way to pay it back by then, so he agreed to the opera. Of course, he wouldn't let Ju Bao pay the money. And so, with work, rest, New Year, and opera, after the Lantern Festival of the following year, Yu Bao allocated a group of people to start ventilating the new mine, in addition to producing coal. However, Yu Bao estimated that his skills were not strong, and he dared not excavate both the east and west mines at the same time, so he only ventilated from the west new mine towards the east mine.

At this time, the whole village was staring at this mine, and the neighboring villages were also gossiping about it. The mine entrance and the market were crowded with people and animals every day, making it very lively. Qian Danao and Ju Bao also came to visit often. Xi Lu also devoted himself to taking care of the mine, and even had Lin Bao manage the market exclusively, and also called his second son back from Yangquan to help. He himself sat in the newly built small shed counter every day, smiling and greeting the people coming and going, while listening to his second son report the accounts, and he calculated with the abacus. When there was nothing to do at the counter, he would go down to both sides of the mine to take a look. Sometimes, when he couldn't sleep at night, he would get up and check the situation. He was anxiously waiting for the ventilation tunnel to be completed.

One night, he was sound asleep when his second son woke him up and said, "The ventilation tunnel must be about to be completed!" He jumped out of bed and went straight to the foot of the slope. Yu Bao was busy leading him down to the west mine. The roadway for excavating the ventilation tunnel at the bottom of the mine was only a little over three feet high and wide. He hunched over and followed in, and when he looked, sure enough! The pickaxe sounded hollow on the coal wall, as if it was about to be completed. He went to the east mine and listened, and he could faintly hear the sound of pickaxes in a branch road in the east mine! He was so happy that his heart was pounding. He went down to the west mine again and spent most of the night in the dirty, coal-filled, and muddy holes of the ventilation tunnel. People told him that it would still take a few days to break through, so he went back to sleep, thinking about how to manage the mine after the ventilation tunnel was completed, how to expand the business, and how to invest more shares in the small shops in Shouyang. One night, he really dreamed that he was making a thousand taels of gold a day, and that he had businesses in Niangziguan, Huolu, and Yuci… Just then, his second son woke him up again, saying that the ventilation tunnel was really about to be completed. He was so anxious that he didn't even wear a hat, but put on a leather coat and, braving the cold wind, went straight down to the west mine. When he listened, the sound of the pickaxe was indeed about to break through immediately. He immediately told his second son to go home and get flatbread to reward everyone. At this time, two people were digging, and Yu Bao also joined in for a while. Xi Lu was so happy that he insisted on digging twice. Seeing that the coal wall was really about to break through, he was so happy that his feet were stepping in the black muddy water, and the hem of his leather coat was also dragging in the muddy water. He didn't care, but kept squatting down and shouting, "Hey! One more time! One more time! Hey, to the right! A little higher!" The small roadway behind was also crowded with people, almost knocking Xi Lu down into the muddy water. He was still shouting, "Push hard! One more time! One more time!"

But a rare thing happened at the bottom of the mine. These days, the sound of the west mine ventilation tunnel being dug hollow was getting louder and louder every day, but the east mine could only hear it faintly, and the sound didn't seem to be getting louder. The miners had been secretly gossiping for a long time, saying that the direction was probably wrong. The idle foreman had also seen it for a long time, but he had been leading the way in Ju Bao's earthen kiln for many years, and Qian Danao had also told him to listen to Yu Bao's words carefully. He told Yu Bao the miners' gossip, and Yu Bao originally had no confidence. Now that things had come to this, he just kept saying that it was nothing, and made up some nonsense to explain. The miners were not convinced, but they didn't say anything. The idle foreman felt that it was useless to say anything, so he just went along with it vaguely. However, Xi Lu and his son were fooled by Yu Bao's words. Now that the west mine was about to break through, but the east mine was still not moving, the idle foreman became anxious and rushed over from the east mine to tell Yu Bao. Yu Bao also panicked. Just then, a large piece of coal was dug down from the ventilation tunnel entrance, and with a bang, Niu Bao was heard shouting, "Damn it, it's broken through!" There was chaos in the ventilation tunnel roadway. Yu Bao and the idle foreman immediately went to the east mine to find the opening. Here, Xi Lu kept shouting, "Don't push! Two more times! Hey, to the left, a little higher!" But when someone from this opening called to the people in the east mine, there was no response. At this time, the opening was bigger, and Niu Bao was the first to crawl through the opening. After taking a closer look, he couldn't help but shout, "Hey! Where is this?" A few more people crawled over and looked for a while. It turned out that this opening did not connect to the east mine, but only connected to a small branch road in the northeast corner of the west mine where no one was digging coal! After more than a month of work, it was just like an animal pulling a mill, going around in a circle and returning to the west mine! The work was completely wasted!

At that time, Xi Lu wasn't wearing much clothing. With this anger, he suddenly lay down at the entrance of the ventilation tunnel, foaming at the mouth, and fainted. People carried him up. They saw that even the flatbread makers in the counter had abandoned their flatbread. In an instant, all the miners in the east and west mines stopped working and ran to the market. The weather outside the mine was cold, and suddenly a gust of wind made people shiver all over. Someone shouted, "It's so cold! Why don't you go home and sleep!" Everyone ran away. Yu Bao didn't know where he was hiding, and no one was in charge of the business. Xi Lu's second son found someone to carry his father home, and quickly boiled hot soup and warm wine, and poured it in for a long time. Near dawn, he finally coughed up a pile of phlegm from his throat. He was awake, but he was lying on the bed and couldn't move.

　　黑石坡煤窑演义（２２）
    康濯
    不过，玉宝跟大三不同。他没有象大三那样，给窑里窑外定出规章，他也不常下窑底，有事多靠给闲工头泰成，或是听牛宝说说窑底营生和窑黑们的情由，见谁不对就吹两句或是扣两个工钱，窑黑们不爱跟他麻烦，也就没出什么大事。喜禄有时也下下窑底，乾大脑碰对了也来窑上瞧瞧；聚宝还来过两回，哈哈笑着，说两句：“哈！辛苦啦！怎么？动弹得还顺手？好！记着！这可是关联咱一社一村一姓的大事！好好干吧！”这时候，玉宝就又比划又说道，吹拍一阵，把人送走，回头就下窑底吆喝道：“聚宝老人家也来看啦！他老人家说问候大家，叫大伙好好干，不兴跳皮捣蛋！这可是咱浑村大事！记住了么？”吆喝完，他又上来歇歇坐坐，黑家就多半把营生交给闲工头，自己去牛宝他嫂那舒舒坦坦睡安生觉。
    看看又是两个来月，新窑也顺顺当当刨出个模样来了。到腊月十八，这一带窑上歇工算账敬老君爷的日子，玉宝跟喜禄结了结账，不错！出炭虽说没去年那么多，可也差不太远，而开新窑花的人工和垫本，却比大三计划的少，喜禄又很高兴，从此并又大胆了些，滚大窑的劲头又一阵比一阵高了。聚宝又跟喜禄贺了喜，并提议大窑在年底放三天官炭，浑村人随便去担，还让喜禄在过年元宵再唱三天戏，并说他也乐意凑个份子出两个钱；喜禄见大窑指望很大，合计着托聚宝借的现洋限期是明年二月，到时会有办法的，也就答应了唱戏，钱当然不让聚宝出。就这么着，动弹、歇工、过年、唱戏，到第二年元宵以后，窑底除开出炭，玉宝就拨了一班人，开始透风筒；不过玉宝估量自己把式不强，不敢东西窑同时刨，就只从西边新窑往东窑透。
    这时浑村都瞪眼望着这窑，邻村也无不捣拉这窑，窑口卖场上每天又是人跟牲口挤碰，好不热闹。乾大脑和聚宝也常来看望，喜禄又一心照顾这窑，并让林宝专一管卖场，还把他二小从阳泉叫回帮忙；他自己每天坐在新搭的小棚柜台里面，一边笑着跟来往的人打招呼，一边听他二小报账，他拨算盘珠；柜上没事，他就下两边窑底看看，有时黑夜睡不着，也要起来瞧瞧虚实，他急燥不安地等着风筒透。
    有一夜，他正睡熟了，他二小叫醒他说：“许是风筒快透啦！”他翻身下炕，直奔坡跟，下边玉宝忙领着他下西窑；窑底那条刨风筒的行道只刨了高宽各三尺多，他哈着腰跟着爬进去一看，果然！镢头刨在煤墙上空空地响，象是快透了；他又去东窑听了听，东窑的一条岔道里也隐隐听见点镢头响声！他高兴得心跳，就又下西窑，在透风筒那又是炭又是土又是脏水的洞洞里圪＠了大半宿，人们告他还得几天才能透开，他才回去睡，并想着透了风筒以后如何经管这窑，如何扩大买卖，给寿阳的小铺再入上股；又有一夜，他果真梦见了他日进千金，他连娘子关、获鹿、榆次都有了买卖……正在这时，他二小又叫醒了他，说这下风筒真个要透了，他急得帽子也没戴，披了件皮袄，冒着冷风，一股劲就下了西窑；他一听，镢头声音的确是象立时就要透开，他马上叫他二小回家取面烙饼犒劳大家。这时有两个人在刨，玉宝也插手刨了一阵，喜禄乐的也硬抢着刨了两下，眼看煤墙真是就要透，他喜得两脚踩在黑泥水里，皮袄下摆也拖在泥水里，他不管，只圪＠着一个劲喊：“呃！一下！再一下！呃，往右！再……”后边小行道里还挤满了人，差点没把喜禄挤得爬倒在泥水坑里，他还是吆喝着：“使劲！一下！再……”
    但窑底却出了稀罕事。这些天西窑风筒刨得空空的声音一天比一天响，东窑却还只听见隐隐的，不见响声加大；窑黑们早就在偷偷地捣拉，说方向怕不对，闲工头也早就看出来了，但他是在聚宝的土窑里领岔多年的人，乾大脑也交代过他，叫他好好听玉宝的话，他把窑黑们的闲话给玉宝说了，玉宝本来就没把握，事到如今，只一个劲推说没甚么，并编了些胡话解释，窑黑们不服，但也不说了，闲工头觉着说也是不顶事，也就稀里麻糊随和着吧！不过喜禄父子却被玉宝的话哄骗住了。现在眼看西窑快透口，东窑却还没动静，闲工头急了，就忙从东窑跑过来告玉宝，玉宝也心慌起来；正在这时，风筒口上又一块大炭被刨下来，轰地一声，只听牛宝嚷道：“＠他妈的，可透啦！”风筒行道里一阵乱，玉宝和闲工头立时往东窑找口子去，这边喜禄直嚷道：“别挤！再来两下！呃，左边，靠上点！”但有人从这边口子上叫东窑的人，却叫不应。这时口子大了，牛宝头一个钻过口子，仔细一看，不觉叫起来道：“咦！这是哪里？”人们又钻过去几个，看了一阵，原来这口子并没透通东窑，只是透通了西窑里边东北角一道没人刨炭的小岔道！一个多月工夫，这不过象牲口拉磨一般转了个圆圈，又透回西窑了！工夫完全白费了！
    当时喜禄本来没穿多少衣裳，这一气，他陡地躺在了风筒口上，口吐白沫沫，晕迷了。人们把他抬上来，只见柜房里烙饼的也丢开饼不烙了，一刹时东西窑窑黑全歇了工，跑上卖场来，窑外天冷，忽地一阵风，人们浑身打哆嗦，不知谁吆喝了一句：“好冷！还不回家睡去！”人们就都跑了个光。玉宝也不知藏到哪里去了，营生也没人管了。喜禄他二小找人把他父亲抬回家，赶紧熬热汤暖热酒，灌了半天，快天明的时候，他才从嗓子眼里咳出一堆痰，人是清醒了，可是，却躺在炕上不能动弹了。
