　　"What Has the "Marshall Plan" Brought to Western Europe?
    Sixteen months have passed since the implementation of the "Marshall Plan." In the first year of implementing the Marshall Plan to Western Europe, the United States spent nearly five billion US dollars. Not long ago, Truman's message to Congress regarding the plan to arm the signatory states of the North Atlantic Treaty inadvertently revealed the true nature of this plan. Truman pointed out that the military expenditure of the five Western Allied countries—Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, plus Italy, Denmark, and Norway—totaled approximately 5.5 billion US dollars last year. A comparison of these two figures makes it perfectly clear that the so-called "aid" of the "Marshall Plan" is entirely for the purpose of the arms race of the Marshallized countries.
    The "Marshall Plan" is a weapon of the United States' policy of preparing for aggressive wars against the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies, aiming to transform Western Europe into a battlefield and base. The United States is trying to use the "Marshall Plan" to make the economies and finances of Western European countries subordinate to its own rule, control the European market, turn Western Europe into an economic colony and appendage of the United States, and achieve its political and military hegemony in the Marshallized countries. The North Atlantic Treaty and the new program of arming Western European countries based on this treaty strengthen the dependence of the Marshallized countries on the United States and prove that American imperialists are carrying out their plundering plans barbarously in Europe.
    So, what has the "Marshall Plan" brought to the people of Western Europe?
    American propaganda has asserted that the "Marshall Plan" seems to be helping the economic recovery of Western European countries. In fact, according to the summary of sixteen months, the "Marshall Plan" has caused serious damage to the economic structures of Western Europe. The industry of Marshallized countries still cannot reach or approach pre-war levels. For example, in France, industrial products in 1948 decreased by 6 percent compared to 1947 (that is, before the "Marshall Plan" began). Belgium decreased by 16 percent, and Norway by 6 percent. This year (1949), the industrial production of most Marshallized countries has begun to decline generally.
    The living standards of the working people in the Marshallized countries have inevitably declined, and the number of unemployed is constantly increasing.
    According to the statistical materials of the United Nations reports, in the first year of the "Marshall Plan" (from April 1948 to March 1949), the number of unemployed in most Marshallized countries increased by 80 to 200 percent. In this situation, it should also be considered that bourgeois statistics may distort the facts, and they always minimize the growth of unemployment. The number of unemployed in Italy is now close to three million, in West Germany 1.5 million, in Belgium more than 300,000, and in Britain, where the armed forces are several times larger than in 1938, there are now 400,000 unemployed people. France, the Netherlands, Denmark, and other countries also have hundreds of thousands of unemployed people.
    Prices are rising, real wages are falling, and the purchasing power of the working masses is declining. Since January 1948, the price of industrial products in France has increased by 45 percent, while the real wages of workers have decreased by 25 percent. If the purchasing power of the French working class in 1946 was 79 percent of the pre-war level, then in the autumn of 1948 it had dropped to 51 percent.
    In Italy—according to official materials—the minimum living cost for a family of four averaged 60,000 lire per month in January 1949, but the average wage did not exceed 25,000 to 27,000 lire, and the allowance for the unemployed, which is provided for only half a year, averages about 6,000 lire per month. According to the "Waarheid" newspaper, Dutch workers this year bought three times less food and two times less industrial products than in 1939.
    In Marshallized Western Europe, taxes are constantly increasing. For example, in Britain in 1949, indirect taxes heavily burdened on workers accounted for 81 percent of direct taxes, while before the war they accounted for only 65 percent of direct taxes. The increase in taxation is primarily due to the arms race, which is caused by the Western European countries' participation in the Western European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty, such aggressive blocs. In 1949, the Marshallized countries significantly expanded their military expenditures, and the old fascist slogan of "guns instead of butter" fully indicates the American policy of Western European Marshallized countries.
    The subordination of Western European countries to American rule has caused the one-sided and deformed development of the Western European economy. The expansion of military production and military-related production has further devastated the peaceful industrial sectors. Under the pressure of American attempts to prevent European commodity competition, the governments of Marshallized countries are systematically destroying many industries that are "unsuitable" for American monopoly capitalists. For example, the French aviation industry has been destroyed. According to the orders of the "Marshall Plan" management, the shipbuilding industries of Britain, France, the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden are planned to be reduced. Due to the influx of American goods into Europe, many important industrial sectors in France (automatic tractors, film projectors) and Belgium (fabrics, shoes, soda production, coal), Italy (silk weaving, automobiles, electrical industry), and the Netherlands (shoes, fabrics) have suffered bankruptcy.
    The "Marshall Plan" has also caused a complete disruption of internal commerce in Europe. In 1948, commercial trade within the Marshallized countries had not yet reached three-quarters of the pre-war level. Under the pressure of the United States, the Marshallized countries have sharply reduced trade with Eastern Europe; last year (1948), the trade volume accounted for only 42 percent of that in 1938. In order to cater to the tastes of American monopoly capital, Western European countries have had to refuse to sell their goods to Eastern Europe and are obligated to buy only what they need from the United States. At the same time, the goods shipped by the United States to Western Europe are much more than they buy. This has created a constant dollar shortage for the Marshallized countries, which makes them more dependent on the United States.
    If the "Marshall Plan" has brought poverty and unemployment to the workers of Western Europe, then it means that the profits of European capitalists continue to grow. The income of British monopoly capitalists in 1948 was 1.945 billion pounds, more than two and a half times that of 1938. If in 1938 the profits of French capitalists were 29 percent of the national income, then in 1948 they had increased to 42.5 percent, while workers' wages in this period decreased from 45 percent to 38 percent. This is how the capitalists shifted the burden of the "Marshall Plan" onto the shoulders of the workers.
    Thus, it seems that the "Marshall Plan" can enrich the capitalists unprecedentedly, while at the same time making the poverty of Western European workers reach new growth.
    The reduction in the purchasing power of the broad masses in Western Europe represents a further contraction of the Western European market, which is a new blow to the plan of capitalist countries to expand exports. This has made the competition between the United States and Britain exceptionally acute, as is the market competition between the United States and other Marshallized countries. The "Marshall Plan" has further sharpened the contradictions within Western European countries and between European and American monopoly capitalists.
    At the same time, the "Marshallization" policy, which tramples on national sovereignty and the interests of the people's lives, is being attacked by the growing resistance of Western European workers. It is destined to be crushed inevitably. (Alekseyev) (Translated by Liu Jing from Pravda, August 17, 1949)

### “马歇尔计划”给西欧带来了什么？

专栏：真理报答读者问

　　“马歇尔计划”给西欧带来了什么？
    从“马歇尔计划”开始实行，到现在经过了十六个月了。美国在进行马歇尔化西欧政策的第一年，就支出将近五十亿美元。不久以前，杜鲁门致送国会关于武装北大西洋公约签字国家计划的咨文，不由得透露了这一计划的真正性质。杜鲁门指出：五个西方联盟国家——英、法、荷、比、卢，加上意大利、丹麦、挪威的军费支出，去年共约五十五亿美元。如果把这两个数字比较一下，就可以使人充分明白“马歇尔计划”的所谓“援助”，完全是作为马歇尔化国家的军备竞争之用。
    “马歇尔计划”是美国为准备反对苏联及人民民主国家的侵略性战争，而欲变西欧为其战场争基地的政策的武器。美国力图借“马歇尔计划”之助，使西欧国家的经济及财政隶属于自己的统治，控制欧洲市场，把西欧变为美国经济的殖民地附庸，并达到在马歇尔化国家内树立其政治及军事霸权。北大西洋公约及基于这个条约的武装西欧国家的新纲领，加强着马歇尔化国家对美国的附属性，并且证明了美帝国主义者在欧洲是蛮悍地进行着自己的掠夺计划。
    那么，“马歇尔计划”给西欧人民带来了什么呢？
    美国的宣传曾断言，“马歇尔计划”似乎是帮助西欧国家经济的复兴。事实上，依据十六个月的总结显示出，“马歇尔计划”更使西欧的经济机构遭到严重的损伤。马歇尔化国家的工业仍然达不到或近于战前水平。例如，在法国，一九四八年工业产品比一九四七年减低了百分之六（即在“马歇尔计划”开始以前）。比利时降低百分之十六，挪威百分之六。在今年（一九四九年），大部马歇尔化国家工业生产更开始普遍下跌。
    马歇尔化国家劳动人民的生活水平不可避免地下降，失业人数在不断的增长着。
    根据联合国会报的统计材料，大部马歇尔化国家，在“马歇尔计划”实施的第一年（从一九四八年四月——一九四九年三月）失业人数增加了百分之八十到百分之二百。在这种情形下，还应该考虑到资产阶级的统计，可能歪曲事实情况，它们总是缩小着失业的增长。意大利现在失业的数目近三百万，西德一百五十万，比利时超过三十万，在武装的数目超过一九三八年数倍的英国，现在已有四十万失业人，法、荷、丹等国也有数十万失业人。
    物价高涨在增长着，实际工资在降低，劳动大众的购买力在低落。从一九四八年一月，法国的工业品价格增了百分之四十五，而劳动者的实际工资减少了百分之二十五。如果一九四六年法国工人阶级的购买力是战前百分之七十九的话，那么一九四八年秋却降到百分之五十一了。
    在意大利——据官方材料——有四口之家的最低生活费，在一九四九年一月的平均数是每个月六万里拉，但平均工资却超不过二万五千——二万七千里拉，而对失业者的津贴，只供给半年，其平均数是每月约六千里拉。据“瓦尔黑德”报计算，今年荷兰工人购买的食品比一九三九年少三倍，工业品少两倍。
    在马歇尔化的西欧，赋税是在不断的增长着。例如，在英国一九四九年重压在劳动者身上的间接税是占直接税的百分之八十一，在战前仅占直接税的百分之六十五。课税增加首先是由于军备竞争而引起的，这军备竞争是因为西欧国家参加了西欧联盟和北大西洋公约这样侵略集团而造成的。一九四九年马歇尔化国家又显著地扩大了军事支出，旧的法西斯的“大炮代替黄油”的口号，即充分指明了西欧马歇尔化国家的美国政策。
    西欧国家隶属于美国的统治，引起西欧经济单方面畸形的发展。军事生产和军事从业生产的扩大，使和平工业部门遭到进一步的摧残。在美国企图预防欧洲商品竞争的压力下，马歇尔化国家的政府进行着有系统的摧毁许多对美国独占资本家“不适合的”工业。例如，法国的航空工业被摧毁了。依据实行“马歇尔计划”管理的命令，英、法、荷、挪和瑞典的造船业计划减缩了。由于美国商品充溢欧洲，使法国许多重要工业部门（自动拖拉机、电影机）及比利时（织品、鞋、制硝、煤）意大利（丝织、汽车、电工业）荷兰（鞋、织品）等重要工业都遭到了破产。
    “马歇尔计划”也引起欧洲内部商业的充分紊乱。在马歇尔化国家内商业贸易一九四八年还没有达到战前的四分之三。美国压迫下的马歇尔化国家，对东欧的贸易更锐减了，去年（一九四八）贸易量才只占一九三八年的百分之四十二。西欧国家为了适合美国独占资本的口味，就不得不拒绝把自己的商品卖给东欧，并且对他们自己所需要的只有义务向美国去买。同时，美国运到西欧的商品，却比他们买的要多得多。这样就形成了马歇尔化国家经常的美元慌，即是使他们更依附于美国。
    如果“马歇尔计划”给西欧劳动者带来了贫穷和失业，那么就是说欧洲资本家的利润却在继续不断地增长。英国独占资本家的收入在一九四八年是一九亿四千五百万英镑，超过一九三八年的两倍半。如果在一九三八年法国资本家利润是全国收入的百分之二十九，那么一九四八年它们已增至百分之四十二点五了，而劳动者工资却在这个期间中从百分之四十五降至百分之三十八。资本家们就是这样地把“马歇尔计划”的负担加到了劳动者的肩上。
    这样看来，“马歇尔计划”能空前地使资本家们致富，同时使西欧劳动者的贫穷却达到新的增长。
    西欧广大群众购买力的降低，表示着西欧市场进一步的收缩，即是对资本主义国家扩展输出的计划，给了一个新打击。而这件事，使美英之间的竞争达到异常尖锐，美国和其他马歇尔化国家间之市场竞争也是如此。“马歇尔计划”更尖锐化了西欧国家内部和欧美垄断资本家之间的矛盾。
    同时，“马歇尔化”政策，蹂躏着国家主权和人民的生活利益，它被西欧劳动者的逐渐生长着的反抗攻击着。它注定遭到不可避免的粉碎。（阿列克歇耶夫）（刘竞译自一九四九年八月十七日真理报）
