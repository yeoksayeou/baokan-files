    [Beijing News] Various government offices, schools, and guard units in Beijing are actively engaged in epidemic prevention. Epidemic prevention committees have been established one after another in units such as the Ministry of Railways, Tsinghua University, the North China Military Region Headquarters, the Special Forces Corps Headquarters, the Infantry School, and the Air Defense Command of the Aviation Department, and are actively carrying out their work. The Epidemic Prevention Committee of the Ministry of Railways also put forward specific requirements for each employee: 1. Accept vaccinations unless a doctor advises otherwise. 2. Wear a mask when going out (purchased uniformly by the Health Bureau), boil the mask in boiling water for ten minutes every night, and dry it before using it again. 3. Protect your legs from flea bites. 4. Publicize knowledge of plague to family members and carry out family hygiene and rat-catching work. 5. Report immediately if a suspected patient is found in your home or neighborhood. All personnel at the North China Military Region Headquarters have been vaccinated. Tsinghua University plans to conduct epidemic prevention injections for all teachers, students, and staff on the 3rd (today) and 4th (tomorrow). Various units have also launched cleaning and sanitation and rat-catching campaigns. The kitchen, dormitory, toilets, and personal beds, clothes, bedding, bowls, and chopsticks of the guard battalion of the North China Military Region have all been disinfected with DDT, quicklime, boiling, or sunlight, and sanitary inspections have been carried out. The Special Forces Corps Headquarters has caught more than thirty rats. The guard battalion of the North China Military Region has also caught eight rats. In addition, in terms of propaganda work, Tsinghua University issued a big-character poster calling on everyone to mobilize urgently to prevent the plague. A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed in the city also voluntarily organized a propaganda team to carry out epidemic prevention propaganda to the masses.
