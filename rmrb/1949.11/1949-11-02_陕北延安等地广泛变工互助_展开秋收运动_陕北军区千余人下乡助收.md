　　Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 1st: Yan'an, Ganquan and other places in northern Shaanxi are widely organizing male and female labor exchange and mutual aid to launch the autumn harvest campaign. Nearby troops are also actively participating in the rush harvest. In the Chuan Kou District of Yan'an County, six townships held a meeting of all township CCP branches, administrative village directors, peasant association group leaders, and activists before the autumn harvest to thoroughly deploy the autumn harvest work. In each village, Party members and cadres took the lead in organizing male and female labor exchange teams, and launched a competition between villages. In Shijiapan Village, with only sixty-odd people, under the personal leadership of labor hero Yang Buhao, all men, women, and children in the village participated in labor exchange and mutual aid to carry out the autumn harvest. In Xinzhuangkou Village and Yangjuangou Village of the same township, women took turns exchanging labor for cooking and delivering meals. The remaining labor force was fully engaged in the rush harvest. Ganquan Fourth District launched the autumn harvest campaign from September 20th. Work teams and district and township cadres conducted land registration and yield assessment at night, and during the day went to the mountains to inspect and lead the masses in the autumn harvest and help with harvesting and transportation. The autumn fields in the district have now been completely harvested. However, some areas disregard the autumn harvest task. For example, the masses near Yan'an delayed harvesting. On the 9th of this month, there was a sudden hailstorm, which damaged more than 30,000 mu of crops, resulting in a reduction of about 1,000 shi of fine grains. The Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Masses Daily published an editorial calling on all localities to hurry up with the autumn harvest, vigorously restore and organize labor exchange and work teams, and mobilize all labor to participate in the harvest, and learn from Yang Buhao Township. The Political Department of the Northern Shaanxi Military Region also notified all personnel of directly subordinate units and affiliated troops on the 10th of last month to go to the countryside to help farmers who lack labor to rush the harvest. From October 11th to 13th, in three days, more than 1,000 people participated in the labor, harvesting 1,459 mu of crops, more than three times the original plan of 400 mu, and helped 209 peasant households.

　　陕北延安等地广泛变工互助
  　展开秋收运动
    陕北军区千余人下乡助收
    【新华社西安一日电】陕北延安、甘泉等地正广泛组织男女劳动力变工互助，展开秋收运动。附近驻军亦积极参加抢收。延安县川口区六乡，在秋收前曾召开全乡中共支部、行政村主任、农会组长及积极分子会议，深入布置秋收工作，各村均由党员、干部带头组织了男女变工队，并展开了村与村的竞赛。仅六十余人的石家畔村，在劳动英雄杨步浩的亲自领导下，全村男女老幼，都参加变工互助，进行秋收。该乡新庄库村、羊圈沟村都由妇女轮流变工做饭和送饭。其余劳动力全部进行抢收。甘泉四区从九月二十日起展开秋收运动，工作组和区乡干部将土地登记、评产工作等放在晚上进行，白天分头上山检查和领导群众秋收并帮助收割转运。该区秋田现已全部收割完毕。但尚有部分地区漠视秋收任务，如延安附近群众因收割迟延，本月九日突下雹雨，打坏庄稼达三万余亩，约减收一千余石细粮。陕北群众日报特发表社论，号召各地赶紧秋收，大力恢复与组织变工、扎工队和所有的劳力参加收割，向杨步浩乡看齐。陕北军区政治部亦于上月十日通知直属各单位全体人员及所属部队下乡帮助缺乏劳动力的农民抢收。自十月十一日至十三日三天内，有千余人参加劳动，计收割庄稼一千四百五十九亩，超过原定计划四百亩的三倍多，并帮助了二百○九户农民。
