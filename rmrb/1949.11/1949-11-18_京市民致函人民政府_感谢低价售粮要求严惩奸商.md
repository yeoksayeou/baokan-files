　　Beijing Citizens Send Letters to the People's Government
　　Thanking them for Selling Grain at Low Prices and Demanding Severe Punishment for Unscrupulous Merchants
    [Reported by this newspaper] Since the prevention of the spread of plague in Beijing and the isolation of the Beijing-Suiyuan railway, the source of grain has been slightly affected. A few illegal merchants took the opportunity to hoard and speculate on grain prices, attempting to obtain huge profits and enrich themselves, disrupting the lives of citizens, and arousing extreme indignation among the vast majority of citizens. In recent days, many citizens have sent letters to the Municipal People's Government and this newspaper, demanding severe punishment for unscrupulous merchants, and expressing their gratitude for the People's Government's low-priced grain sales and price stabilization. A letter from citizen Zhou Xinmin to the Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau said: "Today, reading the newspaper, I learned that the hateful merchants who were raising grain prices have been arrested and brought to justice. This is truly a gratifying thing. I hope the government will severely punish this group of criminals who are driving people to their deaths to vent the people's hatred." The letter also exposed coal merchants who were hoarding and speculating, demanding that the government punish them. A letter signed by a citizen near the east and west, in addition to expressing gratitude to the government for selling grain at low prices and punishing unscrupulous merchants, also demanded that coal-hoarding merchants be severely punished. The letter said: According to newspaper market prices, each ton of coal is no more than 140,000 to 160,000 yuan (the trading company sells each ton for 80,000 yuan), but individual coal shops are asking for 320,000 yuan. If you ask, you can buy one or two tons. According to the coal shop owner, the trading company only sells us one ton per day (note: this is to limit merchants from hoarding), so I can only sell one ton to the outside. As a result, when you look, his yard is piled up like a mountain, but he doesn't sell it, which is extremely hateful. I hope the government will bring to justice unscrupulous merchants who hoard and raise prices and refuse to sell." Citizen Gu Zhaoxiang's letter said: "I am now loudly appealing, I believe that manipulating prices and hoarding rice and flour is not allowed in the current society."

　　京市民致函人民政府
  　感谢低价售粮要求严惩奸商
    【本报讯】京市自防止鼠疫蔓延，隔绝京绥铁路交通以来，粮食来源稍受影响，少数不法奸商即乘机囤积居奇哄抬粮价，图获暴利自肥，破坏市民生活，引起广大市民极端愤慨。日来不少市民纷纷致函市人民政府及本报，要求严厉惩办奸商，并对人民政府低价售粮、平抑物价表示感奋。市民周新民致市府公安局长的信上说：“今天阅报知道已经将可恨的哄抬粮价奸商逮捕法办，这实在是一件大快人心的事。希望政府对这一群逼人死的罪魁们予以严处，以泄民恨”。该信中还揭发了囤积居奇的煤商，要求政府惩办。一封署名东西附近一市民的信上，除对政府低价售粮惩办奸商表示感谢外，也要求严办囤煤奸商，信上说：按报纸市价每吨煤不过人民币十四万与十六万元（贸易公司每吨八万元），而个别煤铺竟有索价三十二万者，你要去问，则买一、二吨尚可，据煤铺掌柜说：贸易公司只卖我们每日一吨（按：这是为了限制奸商囤积），所以我只可往外卖一吨。结果一看他的院内堆积如山，可是不卖，令人痛恨已极。希望政府对囤积居奇抬价拒售的奸商予以法办”。市民顾兆骧的信上说：“我现在大声疾呼，我认为操纵物价、囤积米面，在现社会是不允许的。”
