　　Developing Workers' Night Schools
　　Beijing Municipal Trade Union Council's Transport and Handicraft Workers' Work Committees Hold Cadre Meetings Separately

　　[Beijing News] The Beijing Municipal Trade Union Council Preparatory Committee's Transport Workers' Work Committee and Handicraft Workers' Work Committee separately convened meetings of responsible cadres from their respective industries and levels of trade unions on the 22nd and 23rd to discuss the issue of workers' night schools. The Transport Work Group of the Fourth, Fifth, and Seventh District Offices and the Sixth Sub-district of the Sanitation Team, among others, introduced the situation of the night schools, difficulties encountered, solutions, and experiences and lessons learned in running night schools. They believe that teachers should regularly connect with the workers, pay attention to their feedback, and integrate lectures with the workers' ideological situation and actual lives, using storytelling methods as much as possible. In terms of organizational work, classes and groups should be divided according to the workers' educational level. When assigning work, the person in charge of the Propaganda and Education Department of the Transport Workers' Work Committee requested that each branch union without a night school establish at least one night school within a month; those with established night schools should run at least one night school well. The Handicraft Workers' Union currently has more than 19,800 members, but the number of people attending night school only accounts for 13 percent. Therefore, the meeting emphasized that each cadre of the Handicraft Workers' Union should earnestly mobilize members to attend night school, especially construction workers, who should take advantage of the reduced workload in winter to quickly organize night schools. In addition, issues such as teachers, teaching materials, and funding were also discussed.

　　发展工人夜校
　　京市总工会搬运、手工工人工作委员会分别举行干部会
    【北京讯】北京市总工会筹委会搬运工人工作委员会与手工业工人工作委员会，于二十二、二十三两日，分别召集所属各行业及各级工会负责干部开会，讨论工人夜校问题。四、五、七区办事处搬运工作组及清洁队第六分区等单位介绍了夜校情况、困难问题、解决办法及办夜校的经验教训。他们认为教员要经常与工人联系，注意听取工人的反映，使讲课和工人的思想情况与实际生活相结合，多采说故事的方式讲课，在组织工作方面，要按工人的文化程度分班分组。搬运工人工作委员会宣教部负责人在布置工作时，要求各分会未成立夜校者，在一个月内最少要成立一个夜校；已成立夜校者，最少要办好一个夜校。手工业工会现有一万九千八百余会员，上夜校人数仅占百分之十三，因此会上强调手工业工会每个干部要认真发动会员上夜校，尤其是建筑业工人，更应当利用冬天工作少的机会，迅速组织夜校。此外对教员、教材、经费等问题，也进行了讨论。
