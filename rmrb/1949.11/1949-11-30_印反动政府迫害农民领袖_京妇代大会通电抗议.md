　　Indian Reactionary Government Persecutes Peasant Leaders
　　Beijing Women's Congress Sends Telegram of Protest
　　[From Our Newspaper] The Beijing First Women's Congress, on the 29th of this month, passed a telegram protesting the atrocities of the Indian Nehru government in sentencing peasant leaders to death. The text of the telegram is as follows:
　　"All the representatives of the Beijing First Women's Congress, after hearing Ms. Amitavavi, a member of the preparatory committee of the Asian Women's Congress of India, report on the recent sentencing to death by the reactionary Nehru government of India of thirty peasant leaders, including women leaders, unanimously expressed their boundless indignation. We believe that the Indian peasant leaders represent the millions of impoverished laboring peasants striving for national liberation and freedom, and have the strength of the people of the whole world as their backing. The reactionary government of India has betrayed the interests of the motherland and the nation, and by relying on British and American imperialism to attack the Indian people, is following the path already taken by Chiang Kai-shek. The Indian people will inevitably adhere to the goal of struggle, unite all the democratic and peaceful forces in India, continue to advance, eliminate the reactionary forces, and achieve final victory, just as the Chinese people have achieved victory under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. We now represent one million women in Beijing in lodging a serious protest with the reactionary government of India and demanding an unconditional guarantee of the safety of the peasant leaders' lives and the prompt restoration of their freedom. At the same time, we make an urgent appeal to all the people of India and the people of the world to unite and fight to support the Indian peasant leaders!"

　　印反动政府迫害农民领袖
  　京妇代大会通电抗议
    【本报讯】北京市第一次妇女代表大会，于本月二十九日通过抗议印度尼赫鲁政府判处农民领袖死刑的暴行的通电一则，电文如下：
    北京市第一次妇女代表大会全体代表，听到了印度亚洲妇代会筹备委员阿米塔达维女士关于最近印度尼赫鲁反动政府将三十位农民领袖内有妇女领袖判处死刑的报告后，一致表示无限愤慨。我们认为印度农民领袖代表着千百万的贫苦的劳动农民争取民族解放、自由，有全世界的人民力量作为他们的后盾。印度的反动政府出卖了祖国与民族的利益，投靠英美帝国主义进攻印度人民，正走着蒋介石所已经走过的道路。印度人民必然坚持着奋斗的目标，团结全印度的民主和平力量，继续前进，消灭反动势力，取得最后胜利，正如同中国人民在中国共产党领导下所获得的胜利一样。我们现在代表全北京市一百万妇女，向印度反动政府提出严重的抗议，并要求无条件地保证农民领袖们的生命安全和迅速恢复他们的自由。我们同时向全印度人民和全世界人民提出急切的呼吁，要求一致起来为支援印度农民领袖而奋斗！
