　　Beijing General Labour Union Preparatory Committee
    Arranges Re-election of Union in Public Enterprises
  　Should Mobilize the Masses to Do a Good Job of Union Work
    [Beijing News] The Public Sector Workers' Work Committee of the Beijing General Labour Union Preparatory Committee convened a meeting on the 17th with over 70 responsible cadres from the labour unions of 32 public factories and enterprises in the city to arrange matters related to the re-election of the labour unions. Zhang Hongshun, director of the committee, reported that according to the union's charter, all unions should have held re-elections in October. Except for five units, namely the People's Printing Factory, the Telecommunications Bureau, the Xinhua Printing Factory, the Beijing Automobile Repair Factory, and the Liulihe Cement Factory, the remaining units failed to hold the elections on schedule for various reasons. Efforts should be made to complete the re-elections before the end of this month. It was also pointed out that the re-elections should be used to summarize the union work of the past six months. Some union cadres who are not competent should be adjusted. Before the re-election, preparations should be made: for example, in terms of organization, the member groups should be adjusted according to the production units. The reasons for the few workers who have not yet been admitted to the union should be investigated, and efforts should be made to get them to join the union. During the re-election, criticism and self-criticism should be carried out, and those who have ideas on production, are actively responsible, have close ties with the masses, and have prestige among the masses should be elected as union committee members. Attention should also be paid to young workers and female workers. The elected executive committee members should not hold concurrent positions or hold as few concurrent positions as possible. Only by boldly mobilizing the masses to run the union together can the union work be done well.

　　京市总工会筹委会
    布置改选公营企业工会
  　应发动群众作好工会工作
    【北京讯】市总工会筹委会公营产业工人工作委员会，十七日召集本市各公营工厂企业三十二单位工会负责干部七十余人，布置工会改选事宜。该委员会张鸿舜主任报告指出：依照工会会章规定，各工会本应在十月进行改选，除人民印刷厂、电信局、新华印刷厂、北京汽车修配厂、琉璃河水泥厂等五单位外，其余各单位均因故未能按期举行。应争取本月底以前改选完毕。并指出，应通过改选，将半年来的工会工作作一总结，有的工会干部不称职，应予调整。在改选之前，要作好准备工作：如在组织上应按照生产单位来调整会员小组，少数尚未吸收入会的工人，要查明原因，争取他们加入工会。在改选时，展开批评与自我批评，选举那些在生产上有办法，积极负责、与群众有密切连系、在群众中有威信的人作工会委员，并须照顾到青工、女工等。选出的执委，应该不兼职或少兼职。只有大胆放手发动群众大家来办工会，才能把工会工作作好。
