　　Why Seek to Join the Communist Youth League?
　　Tian Min
　　Recently, I saw an article on a university's wall newspaper, a letter from a student to the Communist Youth League branch. In the letter, he described how he transformed from a psychology of rejection towards the Communist Youth League to actively seeking to join it. According to him, what prompted this transformation was mainly his beginning to recognize the power of organization in his practical life, and feeling that in both study and work, he must have the help and guidance of an organization. He said: Right after liberation, he felt that the Party and League in school were holding meetings all day long, hindering study; therefore, he believed that the Party and League should withdraw from the school, and he absolutely did not want to join the organization, thinking that outside the organization, he could study some books well and seek some knowledge. But later, the facts educated him that the Communist Youth League members not only did not study poorly because of joining the League, but on the contrary, were more capable in their studies; the Communist Youth League not only did not hinder study, but also promoted it. Now, in order to demand that he can study better under the leadership of the League, he is actively seeking to join the Communist Youth League.
　　It should be emphasized that this student is able to experience the power of the Communist Youth League in practical life and study, places great expectations on the organization of the Communist Youth League, and is willing to join the League in order to better study and progress with the help and leadership of the League. This is a great progress. This progress should be fully affirmed, and this kind of improvement in understanding of revolutionary organizations is extremely common among young people today and is a very gratifying phenomenon.
　　However, on the other hand, it must also be pointed out that it is not enough to stop at this step. It is necessary to further clarify: The motivation and purpose of joining the Communist Youth League should not be merely to enable oneself to study better with the help of the League, but it must be clear that the most fundamental purpose of joining the League is to demand that oneself can better serve the people, do more for the people, and under the organizational education and leadership of the League, demand that oneself completely dedicate one's life to the people's revolutionary cause. It should be recognized that the Communist Youth League is an organization that leads and unites young people themselves to serve the people. Since advanced young people demand themselves to serve the people wholeheartedly, they must, therefore, demand themselves at the level of a League member at all times and under any circumstances, and strive to join the League. Therefore, it is not only when the League can help you study that you should actively seek to join the League; even if the League, for some reason, cannot help you study for a while, or even at certain times, requires you to sacrifice your current study for the needs of the revolutionary cause, you should still actively seek to join the League. If you only actively seek to join the League when the League has the power to help you, but are not active when the League does not have this power, or the power is not enough, then it is obvious that it still contains personal elements.
　　But of course, this does not mean that League members should not demand themselves to study better when joining the League. This kind of demand is completely necessary and must be done. But the purpose of studying better is only to enable oneself to better serve the people, and there should never be plans for personal fame, status, gains, and losses. On the other hand, the League organization should pay good attention to leading League members to study, so that every League member becomes an outstanding element in study and leads the masses. Because the task of young people is to study.

### 为什么要求加入青年团？

　　为什么要求加入青年团？
    田敏
    最近在一个大学的墙报上看到一篇文章，是一位同学写给青年团支部的一封信。信中叙述自己怎样从对青年团的排斥心理转变到积极要求加入青年团。据他自己说，促使他这种转变的，主要的是他在实际生活中开始认识到组织的力量，觉得在学习与工作中，自己都必须有组织的帮助与指导。他说：刚一解放时，他觉得党团在学校里，整天开会，妨碍学习；因此，认为党团应该退出学校，而自己则绝对不愿加入组织，以为在组织之外，才能好好读一些书，求得一些知识。但是后来，事实教育了他，青年团员们不但没有因为入团而学习得不好，相反的，是在学习上更有办法；青年团不但没有妨碍学习，而且推动了学习。现在，他为了要求自己能在团的领导下，学习得更好，便积极要求加入青年团。
    应该着重指出来，这位同学能够在实际生活学习中，体验到青年团的力量，对于青年团的组织寄以很大的期望，愿意加入团，以求在团的帮助与领导下，使自己能更好的学习与进步，这是一个很大的进步。这个进步是应该完全加以肯定的，这种对于革命组织认识上的提高，在目前青年中是极其普遍的，是一种很可喜的现象。
    但是，另外一方面，也必须指出，仅仅停留在这一步是不够的。必须更其明确：加入青年团的动机与目的，不应仅仅是为了使自己能获得团的帮助而学习得更好，而必须明确：入团的最根本的目的，是在于要求自己能更好地为人民服务，为人民尽更大的力量，在团的组织教育与领导下，要求自己将一生完全贡献给人民革命事业。应该认识青年团是领导和团结青年们自己的一个为人民服务的组织，先进的青年们既然以全心全意为人民服务来要求自己，因此，也便要在任何条件下，时时刻刻以团员的水平来要求自己，争取入团。因此，就不仅在团可以帮助自己学习的时候应该积极要求入团；即使团因为某种原因，一时或不能帮助你学习，甚至在某些时候，为了革命事业的需要，要你牺牲目前的学习时，也同样应当积极要求入团。假如只有团有力量帮助你时，才积极要求入团，而在团还没有这个力量，或力量不够时，便不积极，则显然还是包含着个人的成分。
    但这当然也并不是说，团员入团，不应该要求自己学习得更好。这种要求是完全应该的，而且是必须的。但学习得更好的目的，也不过是求得自己能更好的为人民服务，而决不应该有个人名誉、地位、得失的打算。另外一方面，团的组织则更应当很好的注意领导团员学习，使每一个团员都成为学习上的优秀分子，带动群众。因为，青年的任务就是学习。
