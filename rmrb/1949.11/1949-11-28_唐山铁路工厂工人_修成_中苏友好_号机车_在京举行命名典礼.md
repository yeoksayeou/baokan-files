　　Tangshan Railway Factory Workers
  　Repair "Sino-Soviet Friendship" Locomotive
  　Naming Ceremony Held in Beijing
    [Our Newspaper] To commemorate the 32nd anniversary of the great Soviet October Revolution, workers at the Tangshan Railway Factory of the Ministry of Railways specially repaired a "Sino-Soviet Friendship" locomotive, which was brought to Beijing on the 25th and presented to the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. The Ministry of Railways and the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association held a naming ceremony for the "Sino-Soviet Friendship" locomotive at Beijing Railway Station.
    After the establishment of a branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association at the Tangshan Railway Factory in October, the workers, through studying internationalism, further awakened their class consciousness. In order to welcome the great October Revolution anniversary, the workers, in addition to their daily work, voluntarily worked overtime in October, using the locomotive frame that had been scrapped during the Kuomintang rule and parts salvaged from piles of scrap iron, to repair the locomotive. Missing parts were made by themselves, and many kinds of locomotive parts that the factory had never made before were also successfully manufactured. With the great creativity of the workers, overcoming various difficulties, the "Sino-Soviet Friendship" locomotive was successfully completed on November 2nd. And its performance is very good.
    At 2 p.m. on the 25th, the "Sino-Soviet Friendship" locomotive, adorned with the national flags of China and the Soviet Union, and tied with red, green, and yellow ribbons, slowly entered Beijing East Station amidst the warm welcome of more than 500 representatives from various agencies, factories, and schools in Beijing, railway workers, and Soviet friends. The entire locomotive was wiped clean and shiny black, with the embossed Chinese and Russian characters for "Sino-Soviet Friendship" engraved on the front of the locomotive. In the center, the raised national flags of China and the Soviet Union were intertwined, and portraits of Chairman Mao and Marshal Stalin were hung in the glass frames on both sides. Below the flags were two huge hands clasped tightly, representing the close unity of the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union. After Xiao San, Deputy Secretary-General of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, cut the ribbon, the naming ceremony began. Representatives of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association presented flowers to the fourteen workers from the Tangshan Railway Factory who came to Beijing with the locomotive. Wang Ping, representative of the Trade Union directly under the Ministry of Railways, Xiao San, Deputy Secretary-General of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, Simenov, Chief Advisor of the Ministry of Railways, Seleznev, representative of the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries in Beijing and Soviet Consul General in Beijing, Li Menghou, Deputy Director of the Factory Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, and Luo Xianzhang, a worker from the Tangshan Railway Factory, spoke successively, unanimously supporting the eternal unity and friendship between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union. Finally, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association presented a banner to the workers of the Tangshan Railway Factory, which read "Enhance Sino-Soviet friendship, learn from the Soviet experience in construction."

　　唐山铁路工厂工人
  　修成“中苏友好”号机车
  　在京举行命名典礼
    【本报讯】铁道部唐山铁路工厂工人为了纪念伟大的苏联十月革命三十二周年，特精修了一辆“中苏友好”号机车，于二十五日开来北京，献给中苏友好协会总会；铁道部与中苏友好协会即于北京车站举行“中苏友好”号机车命名典礼。
    唐山铁路工厂于十月成立中苏友好协会支会以后，工人们经过学习国际主义，更启发了阶级觉悟，为了迎接伟大的十月革命节，工人们除了日常工作外，十月份又自动地加班，利用在国民党统治时期早已报废的机车架子及乱铁堆里捡回的零件，动手修造机车。缺少的零件就自己动手造，许多种该厂从未造过的机车零件也都造成功了。以工人伟大的创造力，克服了种种困难，“中苏友好号”机车乃于十一月二日胜利完成。而且效能非常良好。
    二十五日下午二时，“中苏友好号”机车高挂中苏两国的国旗，扎着红、绿、黄色的彩绸，在京市各机关、工厂、学校代表和铁路工人五百多人及苏联朋友们的热烈欢迎下，徐徐驶进北京东站。整个机车擦得漆黑明亮，车头前面嵌刻着红色中文和俄文的“中苏友好号”的凸字，中央交插着凸起的中苏两国国旗，两旁玻璃框里分别挂着毛主席和斯大林大元帅的像片，旗下面是两只巨手紧紧的握着，表示着中苏两大民族的紧密的团结。中苏友好协会总会副总干事萧三剪彩之后，命名典礼大会开始，中苏友协代表向随车来京的唐山铁路工厂的十四位工友献花，铁道部直属工会代表王萍，中苏友协副总干事萧三，铁道部总顾问西米诺夫，苏联对外文化协会驻北京代表、苏联驻北京总领事谢列金，铁道部厂务局副局长李梦吼及唐山铁路工厂工人罗宪章都先后讲话，一致拥护中苏两大民族永远团结友好。最后中苏友协向唐山铁路工厂工人献旗，旗上写着“增强中苏友谊，学习苏联建设经验。”
