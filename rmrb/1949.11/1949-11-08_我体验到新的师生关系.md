　　I Experienced a New Teacher-Student Relationship
　　Wang Ci

　　In the past, I worked as a teacher for over ten years, and even as a Dean of Students for two years. That was during the period when Japanese imperialism ruled China. I felt that teaching was very "noble," not concerned with politics, and relying on knowledge to earn a living. Looking back now, that was exactly the kind of docile citizen that Japanese imperialism wanted. During my time as Dean of Students, I thought: students and I are both slaves of a conquered nation, I should be as kind as possible to the students, avoid corporal punishment, and stay with the students often, becoming one with them. But strangely, after doing this for a year, I didn't see any results. Students rarely sought me out to talk. When I joined their games of basketball, no one would compete for the ball when it came to me. Sometimes they would be enthusiastically talking and laughing in a circle, and when I smilingly approached them, they would very formally salute me, and then one by one would slip away, making me very disappointed. At the time, I thought: I am so good to the students, why do they still have to be afraid of me? Recently, to learn more about our profession, we visited several middle schools, including Xinsheng Middle School, Beijing Municipal Normal School, and Municipal Fourth Middle School. Through this visit, I solved this problem.

　　At Beijing Normal, I asked a student: "Are you afraid of your Dean of Students?" He said in a puzzled way: "The school consults with us on everything. We all establish rules together, and everyone abides by them. What is there to be afraid of?" And at any time, you could see groups of students chatting and laughing very naturally with teachers after class, asking questions. These situations moved and inspired me. Later, I also listened to the Dean of Students of the Second Academy of Xinsheng Middle School talk about student management methods. He said: "How do we lead students? We use various meetings to promote [progress], use democratic centralism, cultivate core members and rely on activists, promote student learning competitions, and use appropriate praise or group criticism..." In the old society, principals, deans, and class teachers were all high and mighty, treating students as objects of oppression. The Dean of Students' task was specifically to suppress students and maintain school "security." Even if there were individual progressive educators, under reactionary political conditions, they could not freely implement correct educational policies. In that kind of situation, how could there be a correct teacher-student relationship?

　　In Beijing before liberation, some people shouted the nonsensical slogan "keep all politics out of schools." These people felt that education was noble and unrelated to politics, but in front of students, they taught books that had been censored by reactionaries, and the school's system was stipulated by the reactionary Ministry of Education. Students had no freedom of thought or freedom of reading. This time, when I participated in a group discussion in the Senior Two Class A group of girls at Beijing Normal, they discussed whether "democracy" and "dictatorship" were contradictory. They all happily expressed their opinions, often causing heated debates. I should learn from that kind of vigorous spirit. They clearly understood what kind of relationship existed between politics and education. But when we listened to teachers lecturing, although the vast majority were moving in the new direction, there were still a very few teachers who felt that teaching had nothing to do with politics. For example, when a Chinese language teacher lectured on Han Yu's "Eight Records of Yongzhou," he said: "This is a travelogue, and has nothing to do with politics." There were also some science teachers who said the same thing. I feel that this is all wrong. No course can be separated from politics. Professional skills must be built on a political foundation.

　　In the old society, the courses taught in schools were all for the reactionary ruling class's service. There is no reason to say that they were "noble" or "transcendent." I think of how I once maintained the school's "security" for Japanese imperialism and reactionaries. In the future, I must take an attitude of atoning for my sins to the people and engage in New Democratic education.

　　Now many old teachers have a feeling that students are progressing very quickly, and if they don't study hard, they will fall behind. For example, at a teachers' professional meeting at the First Academy of Xinsheng Middle School, a teacher said: "My political knowledge can no longer solve the problems raised by students. We all have to study quickly." This awareness is a very good phenomenon. This awareness makes us understand that we should learn many things from students. This awareness is the guarantee of teachers' progress.

　　Through this visit, I deeply realized the greatness of a people's teacher and the arduousness of his work. His every word and deed are influencing students' thoughts, or rather, influencing the future of the New Democratic society. Every teacher must use the course they teach to give students a correct understanding of life and society; to cultivate students' concepts of loving the motherland, loving the people, and loving labor. A people's teacher should be a fighter against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and a propagandist of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. This task is arduous, great, and glorious at the same time.

### 我体验到新的师生关系

　　我体验到新的师生关系
    王慈
    过去，我曾经作过十来年的教员，并且还作过两年的训育主任；那正是日本帝国主义在中国统治的时期，我觉得教书是很“清高”的，不过问政治，凭着学识吃饭。现在想来，那正是日本帝国主义所要求的顺民。作训育主任时期，我曾想：学生和我都是亡国奴，我要尽量对学生宽厚，不要体罚，和学生常在一起，打成一片；但是很怪，当我这样作了一年以后，并没有见到什么成效。学生很少自动的找我说话。我参加他们的队伍去玩篮球，球到了我手里的时候，谁也不来争夺；有时他们围一圈人在兴致勃勃地谈笑，我也笑着凑上去，他们就很规矩的给我敬礼，然后一个一个的就溜开了，使我非常扫兴。当时我想：我对学生很好，为什么他们非要怕我不成呢？最近，为了学习业务，我们到几处中学去参观，共参观了新生中学、北京市立师范学校和市立第四中学三个学校。通过了这次参观，我解决了这个问题。
    在北师，我问到一个学生：“你怕你们的教导主任吗”？他很莫明其妙的说：“学校什么事情，都和我们商量，我们大家订立规章，大家遵守，有什么怕不怕呢？”并且随时都可看到一群学生，在课外和教员们很自然的谈笑，提着问题。这些情况，都使我感动和欣羡。后来，我又听了新生中学二院教导主任谈管理学生的方法，他说：“如何领导学生呢？我们用各种会议来推动，用民主集中制，培养骨干依靠积极分子，提倡学生的学习竞赛，利用适当的表扬或小组批评……。”在旧社会里，校长、主任、级任大都是高高在上的，把学生看成是压迫的对象。训育主任的任务更是专门镇压学生维持学校“治安”的。即或有个别进步的教育工作者，但在反动的政治条件下，也不可能自由地施行正确的教育方针，在那种情况之下，那能有正确的师生关系呢？
    北京在解放前，有些人喊着“一切政治退出学校”这样一句讲不通的话。这些人觉得教育是清高的，是和政治无关的，但他在学生面前所讲的是反动派所审订过的书籍，学校的制度是反动的教育部所规定的。学生们是没有思想自由、阅读自由的。这次我在北师参加女生高二甲组的小组讨论会的时候，她们讨论“民主”和“专政”是否矛盾的问题，她们都愉快的发表着自己的意见，不时引起剧烈的争辩，那种生气勃勃的精神，我应当向她们学习。她们很清楚的知道，政治与教育是什么样的关系。但当我们听教员讲课时，虽然绝大部分都向着新方向走，可是还有极少数的教员觉得教书与政治没有什么关系。譬如一位国文教员讲韩愈所作的“永州八记”时说：“这是一篇游记，和政治没有关系”。还有一些教理科的教员也是这样的说法。我觉得这都是不对的，没有一门课程能离开政治的。业务必须建筑在政治的基础上。
    在旧社会的学校里所教的课程，都是为反动派统治阶级服务的，没有任何理由可以说是“清高”的，或是“超然的”的，我想到我曾经为日本帝国主义及反动派维持了学校的“治安”，今后必须抱着向人民赎罪的态度，从事于新民主主义的教育。
    现在很多旧的教员都有了一个感觉，觉得学生的进步很快，自己如不加紧学习就掉队了。如在新生中学一院的教员业务会上，一个教员说：“我的政治知识已经解决不了学生所提的问题，我们都得赶快学习”。这个觉悟是很好的现象，这个觉悟使我们懂得许多事情应当向学生学习。这个觉悟就是教员们进步的保证。
    通过这次参观，我深深的认识了一个人民教师的伟大，和他的工作的艰巨。他的一言一行都在影响着学生的思想，或者说，影响着新民主主义社会的前途。每位教师，都要通过所任的课程，使学生对于生活，对于社会有个正确的认识；要培养学生爱祖国，爱人民，爱劳动的观念。一个人民教师应当就是一个反帝国主义、反封建主义、反官僚资本主义的战士，是马列主义与毛泽东思想的宣传家；这个任务是艰巨的、伟大的，同时，是光荣的。
