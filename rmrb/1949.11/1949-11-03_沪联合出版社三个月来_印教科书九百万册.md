Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 2nd—The Shanghai United Publishing House, formed by the union of sixty-two bookstores, has published 9.3 million copies of primary and secondary school textbooks and workers' readers after three months of intensive production. These textbooks not only supplied more than 1,500 primary and secondary schools, workers' night schools, and remedial classes in Shanghai, but also supplied areas such as Southern Jiangsu, Northern Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Southern Anhui, Northern Anhui, Jiangxi, and cities such as Nanjing, Hankou, and Changsha. At the summary meeting held by the United Publishing House on the 1st of this month, it was pointed out that the ability to complete such a heavy publishing and distribution task in a short period of time was due to the unity of the publishing industry in Shanghai and the spirit of serving the new democratic culture. This printing of textbooks was a mass cooperative effort. In addition to the members, twenty-five suppliers and forty-four printing factories and one hundred and thirteen binding companies participated. The work spirit of the employees is especially admirable. They work more than ten hours a day, some up to sixteen hours, and they are able to produce high-quality printing and solid binding. In order to ensure a widespread supply, textbooks are priced low. However, there are still shortcomings in distribution, namely that the supply to rural areas is not yet sufficient.

　　沪联合出版社三个月来
  　印教科书九百万册
    【新华社上海二日电】由六十二家书店联合组成的上海联合出版社，经过三个月的突击生产，出版了中、小学教科书和工人读本九百三十万册。这些课本不仅供应了上海一千五百多所中小学校、工人夜校、补学班等，而且也供应了苏南、苏北、浙江、皖南、皖北、江西等地区和南京、汉口、长沙等城市。联合出版社于本月一日举行总结大会时指出：能在短期内完成如此繁重的出版发行任务，是由于沪市出版界同业的团结一致和为新民主主义文化服务的精神。这一次印出教科书，是一个群众性的合作工作，除社员外，参加供应的有二十五家，参加印刷的工厂四十四家，参加装订的一一三家。职工们的工作精神，尤其可佩，他们每天工作十小时以上，多的到十六小时，并且能做到印刷精良，装订牢固。为了普遍供应，教科书定价低廉。但在发行上却还有缺点，就是对农村的供应还嫌不够。
