Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 14th – When the Chinese Democratic Youth Delegation returned to China, they brought back nearly a thousand gifts from international friends and over ten thousand books.

A portion of the gifts were specially given to Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and Deputy Commander-in-Chief Peng by leaders and people of various countries. Hungarian Prime Minister Rakosi gave Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and Deputy Commander-in-Chief Peng the finest wines and two hunting rifles, with the names of Commander-in-Chief Zhu and Deputy Commander-in-Chief Peng exquisitely engraved on the rifles. The representative of Democratic Greece presented Commander-in-Chief Zhu with the EPOH badge of the Greek Youth League and the military emblem of the Greek People's Army, and said in the dedication that the Greek people would always stand with the Chinese people led by Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and fight imperialism and its running dogs to the end.

When the delegation passed through Moscow on its way back home, the Central Committee of the Soviet Lenin Communist Youth League specially presented the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League with ten thousand books, including Marxist-Leninist theoretical works and summaries of the rich experience of the Soviet Union's 32 years of nation-building in the economic, cultural, and youth work fields.

New Democratic countries in Eastern Europe also gave us many gifts. Czechoslovakia sent a relief of Stalin's image, a radio, and a clock; Romania sent Romanian national costumes; Poland presented displays with the Polish national emblem, and so on.

French miners gave our representatives miners' lamps used in coal mines, asking them to pass them on to Chinese coal miners.

The Italian delegation gave China a "Flag of Peace." Last year and this year, Italian workers and farmers in northern Italy launched the "Flag of Peace" movement in the strikes against the Marshall Plan, against new war conspiracies, and for peace. At that time, almost every household hung this Flag of Peace, which was once planted on the reactionary Foreign Ministry building. The Italian representative presented this glorious flag to the Chinese people as a souvenir at the conference.

The Vietnamese delegation presented gifts including a portrait of the Vietnamese people's leader Ho Chi Minh and many handkerchiefs, with the Vietnamese map and the slogan "Stop the War Against Vietnam" printed on the handkerchiefs.

Indonesian representatives sent many Indonesian national emblems.

Indian youth representatives saved money on food to buy many flowers and made a plaque with the inscription "Salute to the Victorious Chinese Youth," along with two color cartoons for the Chinese representatives. One of the cartoons depicts farmers in the Bengal region of India, under the leadership of the Communist Party, implementing rent and interest reduction movements. After gaining initial liberation, they are happily planting rice seedlings and harvesting crops. The other depicts the heroic battle between the guerrillas of the Deccan area, the first liberation army of India, and the enemy.

The conference was held in Hungary. Hungarian workers, peasants, youth league members, Young Pioneers, students, children, and old women brought gifts from tens or even hundreds of miles away to Budapest. During the breaks, until late at night, groups of Hungarians still came to the residence of our representatives chanting "Mao Zedong! Mao Zedong!" to congratulate and give gifts. Among the gifts from the coal miners was a coal car model made of a fist-sized lump of coal; the power plant workers gave a model of an electric motor. There were also models of lathes, gliders, tractors, trams, etc. The farmers brought apples from their orchards, homemade bread, homemade wine, cured pork, beloved porcelain, bronze statues, embroidered shoes made by women, and toys such as beloved dolls and small rubber balls made by children.
