    Learning from Bethune
    Mao Zedong

    (I) Comrade Bethune was a Canadian communist, over fifty years old. To help China's War of Resistance Against Japan, he was dispatched by the Canadian and American Communist Parties and traveled across the Pacific Ocean to China. When he arrived in Yan'an last spring, he requested to work in Wutai Mountain. Unfortunately, he died in the line of duty. A foreigner, without any selfish motives, regarded the cause of liberation of the Chinese people as his own. What kind of spirit is this? This is the spirit of internationalism, the spirit of communism. Every Chinese Communist Party member must learn this spirit from him. Lenin said: "The proletariat of capitalist countries should support the independence movements of colonial and semi-colonial countries, and the proletariat of colonial and semi-colonial countries should support the union of the proletariat of capitalist countries. Only then can the world revolution be victorious." Comrade Bethune practiced this Leninist line. We Chinese Communist Party members must also practice this line, uniting with the proletariat of all capitalist countries, uniting with the proletariat of Japan, Britain, the United States, Germany, Italy, and all capitalist countries, in order to overthrow Imperialism, liberate our own nation and people, and liberate the nations and peoples of the world. This is our internationalism, the internationalism we use to oppose narrow nationalism and narrow patriotism.

    (II) Comrade Bethune's spirit of utter selflessness and devotion to others is manifested in his extreme responsibility towards his work and his extreme enthusiasm towards his comrades and the people. Every communist must learn from him. Many people are irresponsible in their work, shying away from the difficult and choosing the easy, pushing heavy burdens onto others and taking the light ones for themselves. Before anything, they think of themselves first and then of others. They feel great after making a small effort, liking to boast, afraid that others won't know. They are not filled with enthusiasm towards their comrades and the people, but are cold, indifferent, and apathetic. Such people are not really communists, or at least cannot be considered pure communists. They should feel ashamed in the face of Comrade Bethune. Those who have returned from the front lines, when speaking of Bethune, none does not admire him, none is not moved by his spirit. The soldiers and civilians in the Jin-Cha-Ji area, all those who have personally received treatment from Dr. Bethune and witnessed his work, are moved by him. Every communist must learn from Comrade Bethune, this truly communist spirit.

    (III) Bethune was a doctor, and he used his medical skills as a profession, striving for perfection. Within the entire Eighth Route Army medical system, his medical skills were the most brilliant. He was over fifty years old and never thought of changing this career. This is also an excellent lesson for those who are fickle, for those who despise technical work, thinking it is insignificant and without a future.

    (IV) I only met Comrade Bethune once. Later, he sent me many letters, but because I was busy, I only replied to one. I don't even know if he received it. As for his death, I feel very apologetic. Now that everyone commemorates him, it shows how deeply his spirit touches people. We must all learn from his spirit of utter selflessness. Starting from this point, we can become people who are greatly beneficial to the people. A person's ability may be great or small, but as long as they have this spirit, they are a noble person, a pure person, a moral person, a person who has transcended vulgar interests, and a person who is beneficial to the people.

    学习白求恩
    毛泽东
    （一）白求恩同志是加拿大的共产党员，五十多岁了，为了帮助中国的抗日战争，受加拿大与美国共产党的派遣，不远万里渡过太平洋，来到中国。去年春上到延安时，他就要求去五台山工作，不幸以身殉职。一个外国人，毫无利己的动机，把中国人民的解放事业，当作他自己的事业，这是什么精神？这是国际主义的精神，这是共产主义的精神，中国共产党员每个都要学习他这种精神。列宁说：“资本主义国家的无产阶级要拥护殖民地半殖民地的独立运动，殖民地半殖民地的无产阶级要拥护同资本主义国家无产阶级的联合，世界革命才能胜利。”白求恩同志是实践了这一条列宁主义路线的，我们中国共产党员也要实践这一条路线，我们要同一切资本主义国家的无产阶级联合起来，要同日本的、英国的、美国的、德国的、意大利的、以及一切资本主义国家的无产阶级联合起来，才能打倒帝国主义，解放我们的民族与人民，解放世界的民族与人民。这就是我们的国际主义，这就是我们用以反对狭隘民族主义，反对狭隘爱国主义的国际主义。
    （二）白求恩同志毫无利己专门利人的精神表现在他对工作的极端负责任，对同志对人民的极端的热忱。每个共产党员都要学习他，不少的人对工作不负责任，拈轻怕重，把重担子推给人家，自己挑轻的，一事当前，先替自己打算一下，然后再替别人打算，出了一点力就觉得了不起，喜欢自吹，生怕人家不知道，对同志对人民不是满腔热忱，而是冷冷清清的，漠不关心，麻木不仁，这种人其实不是共产党员，至少不能算一个纯粹的共产党员，对着白求恩同志应该愧死。从前线回来的人说到白求恩，没有一个不佩服的，没有一个不为他的精神而感动的。晋察冀一带的军民，凡亲身受过白求恩医生的治疗及亲眼看过白求恩医生的工作的，无不为之感动，每个共产党员，一定要学习白求恩同志这种真正共产主义者的精神。
    （三）白求恩是个医生，他以医疗技术为职业，精益求精，在整个八路军医务系统中，他的医术是最高明的。他五十多岁了，干此一门并未想改换，这对于一般见异思迁的，对于一般鄙薄技术工作以为不足道，以为无出路的人，也是一个极好的教训。
    （四）我对白求恩同志只见过一面，后来他给我来过许多信，可是我因为忙，仅回过他一封信，还不知他收到没有？至于他的死，我是很歉仄的，现在大家纪念他，可见他的精神感人之深，我们大家要学习他毫无自私自利之心的精神，从这点出发，就可以变为大有利于人民的人，一个人能力有大小，但只要有这点精神，就是一个高尚的人，一个纯粹的人，一个有道德的人，一个脱离了低级趣味的人，一个有益于人民的人。
      一九三九年十二月二十一日
