　　The Soviet Union is the Most Loyal Friend of the Chinese People
  　Field Notes from a Three-Month Internship in the Northeast
    Zhu Yixin, China Jiaotong University, Beijing School of Management
    We are fortunate to have been born in the era of Mao Zedong, which has given us the opportunity to go to the Northeast for internships and visits, allowing us to live happily with our international friends, the Soviet comrades, and our worker brothers. We are able to learn their science and technology, absorb their construction experience, and combine the theories we learned in textbooks at school with practical work on the ground. This lays the foundation for us to better serve the people's cause in the future.

    On July 9th, with the assistance of the People's Government, we left school and went to Harbin, the railway center of the Northeast, for our internship. The school stipulated that our internship in the Northeast would last for three months, with five-sixths of the time spent on the internship and one-sixth on visits. We carried out this predetermined plan step by step during our intense and pleasant summer life. The scope of the internship and visits was quite extensive, not only reaching Dalian in the southernmost part of the Northeast and Jiamusi in the northernmost part, but also Suifenhe in the easternmost part and Manzhouli in the westernmost part, penetrating deeply into the vast working class and traversing the entire Northeast.

    The three months of practical work educated us, made us realize the greatness of the proletarian workers' strength, and initially established a labor viewpoint. At the same time, from many specific facts, we personally experienced the great internationalist spirit of the socialist country of the Soviet Union, which helped China improve the railways in the Northeast and restore and develop the destroyed industrial and mining enterprises in the Northeast. This made us realize that "The Communist Party of the Soviet Union is our best teacher, and we should learn from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union," as instructed by Chairman Mao, the leader of the Chinese people, is absolutely true.
    　　　　
    　　　　I. Absorbing Soviet Experience, the People's Railways in the Northeast Undergo an Unprecedented Great Revolution

    It has only been four short years since the people themselves truly had the right to manage the railways in the Northeast, and the achievements have been brilliant, even surpassing the era of Japanese puppet rule. This is due to the correct leadership of the Party and the help of Soviet comrades, which overthrew the conservative, backward, and unscientific imperialist colonial management system of the puppet Manchurian era, and replaced it with a progressive, new, and scientific management system that is the crystallization of the Soviet Union's thirty years of railway construction experience. This has brought about an unprecedented great revolution in China's railway management system, shortened the turnaround rate of vehicles, and improved the transportation efficiency of the railways.

    After interning as dispatchers in the dispatching office of the Harbin Railway Bureau, we deeply understood the advantages of the new train operation system introduced by the Soviet Union. It gives the dispatcher great power, allowing each dispatcher to exert their high level of initiative and creativity, becoming a veritable traffic commander. Comparing the old and new train operation systems side by side, we can easily understand that the old train operation system made each dispatcher rigidly follow the timetable to handle train operations, like a rigid recorder, which restricted the workers' creativity. This proves that the management systems of capitalist countries and socialist countries are essentially different: one restricts the creativity of workers, while the other tries its best to develop the creativity of workers.

    After the implementation of the new train operation system, it quickly achieved amazing results, shortening the vehicle turnaround rate from 6.1 to 2.83. This broke the conservative thinking of the employees and the wrong idea of blindly believing that everything Japanese was good. The workers in the dispatching office said: "When the Soviet Union introduced the new train operation system, we all thought it was not as good as the Japanese system and that it would not work and that accidents would occur. However, with the efforts of the Party, government, labor union, and Soviet comrades, we finally overcame our bias. As a result, the test results were far better than during the puppet Manchurian period, which cleared up our thinking and made us realize that the Soviet big brother's system is really good and much better than the Japanese system."

    The Soviet Union not only introduced one or two systems, but many new systems, such as the crew responsibility system, the financial responsibility system, and the new road maintenance method. These overcame the phenomena of no one being responsible in capitalist enterprises, no financial planning, and blind production in various departments without any connection. When we were interning on the trains, we saw the drivers carefully checking and wiping the locomotives at each station. Once, while I was learning to drive a locomotive on the Bin-Sui line, I asked a driver named Xia why they were so careful to inspect at each station. He said, "Our locomotives are like the peasants' own fields, so of course we have to take good care of them." His answer made me deeply feel that this was the effect of implementing the crew responsibility system introduced by socialist Soviet Union to replace the rigid and backward rotation system, which inspired the drivers' sense of responsibility and creativity, extended the life of the locomotives, and increased their traction and work efficiency. This is something that cannot be done in a capitalist social system, and it is something that capitalist countries have never dreamed of.

    Indeed, in the past four years, under the leadership of the Party and with the enthusiastic help of Soviet comrades, the Northeast Railway has absorbed the experience of Soviet railway construction, implemented scientific management systems, broken the conservative thinking of employees, eliminated the wrong idea that "the United States is the best in railway management, and Japan is second," overcome the difficulties of extended routes and lack of vehicles, and vigorously supported the front line to meet the needs and development of the revolutionary situation, completing the great transportation tasks it was responsible for. Now, the Northeast Railway is a demonstration zone for Chinese railways, standing at the forefront of railways and leading the unprecedented great railway revolution in the history of Chinese railways.
    　　　　
    　　　　II. How are our Technical Personnel Trained?

    On September 27, we visited the largest railway factory in the country, the Dalian Railway Factory, in Dalian. This huge factory includes a total of twenty-seven branch factories. Before liberation, each of the factory's sophisticated technical departments was controlled by the Japanese, and the Chinese only did rough and miscellaneous work. Since the liberation by the Soviet Red Army, a large number of Chinese workers have been promoted and taught technology in order to manage their own factories. Director Dong of the factory told us: "Before liberation, this factory had 7,000 people, of whom 4,000 were Japanese and 3,000 were Chinese laborers. Since the Red Army came, a large number of laborers have been promoted and trained as technicians. As long as the Chinese learn, the Soviet comrades will let the Chinese do it themselves. Now, many of the factory directors in this factory have been promoted from among the workers. At present, there are a total of 7,600 people in the factory, only seventy-six Soviet technical personnel, and four Japanese." When we heard him say this, and we also saw with our own eyes thousands of Chinese workers working hard in various units of the factory. We not only saw Chinese male technicians, but also many female technicians, such as the nationally famous female labor hero Qi Guizhi, who was promoted from a laborer in this factory to a skilled female lathe operator.

    Under Japanese rule, workers in the Lushun-Dalian area were not allowed to receive higher education, so the workers in the railway factory had a very low level of education. Among the more than 7,000 people in the factory, from the director to the workers, there was only one high school graduate, and the rest were only at the primary or elementary school level. So how is it possible to manage such a large factory in an orderly manner and ensure the completion of tasks, and to achieve production exceeding the plan? The reason is very simple: it is because the Communist Party and the working class hold the spirit of "if we don't know how, we will learn," and have achieved it with the enthusiastic help of Soviet comrades.

    There are cultural literacy classes in the factory. In order to teach the Chinese workers the technology, the Soviet comrades patiently teach from the addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of mathematics. For example, the Scientific Research Institute of the factory has ten graduate students, all of whom are at the primary school level, and the Soviet comrades are willing to patiently teach them from the chemical symbols and letters in order to train Chinese specialized personnel, and the results have been good so far.

    In order to combine theory with practice, the technical school run by the factory, which used to train only Japanese people but now trains Chinese youth, spends half of each week on internships. When we visited, we saw young students interning in small internship factories one by one. Comrade Qu, who led us on the visit, said, "The materials for their internships are somewhat lacking and must be shipped from Moscow, but the Soviet comrades do not take into account the shortage, let alone the high price, and continue to provide them with internships, with the sole purpose of ensuring that they learn the technology well."

    Imperialist countries are selfish. They do not want others to know what they know and hope to monopolize all means of production forever to enslave other nations. The brake sub-factory in the iron factory is an example of Japan's economic aggression of "agricultural China, industrial Japan." It is a factory that manufactures three-motion valves, which are necessary for vehicles during braking. In the Japanese era, no outsiders were ever allowed to enter, and there were guards all around, making it particularly mysterious. An old worker in the factory told us: "I have been a laborer in the railway factory for more than thirty years, and I have never known what the 'small noses' (referring to the Japanese) were doing in this factory." Yes, this is the true color of imperialism. Under Japanese rule, the Chinese people could not only not learn technology, but were not even allowed to watch. The situation with the Soviet comrades in the socialist country is completely different. They not only let the Chinese learn, but also tried every means to teach the Chinese workers and help improve their technical level. In the past four years, under the enthusiastic training of the Soviet comrades, the workers of the three-motion valve factory, which the Japanese have always considered mysterious, have been able to manufacture these three-motion valves from the hands of our own workers starting this year. This shattered the Japanese propaganda of enslaved thinking that the Chinese could not learn and master sophisticated technologies.

    Not only did the Dalian Railway Factory receive Soviet assistance in solving the problem of the lack of technical personnel, but the majority of industrial and mining enterprises in Lushun-Dalian and the entire Northeast benefited from Soviet assistance and adopted their scientific apprentice system. The master could receive factory rewards for teaching the apprentice, and the apprentice could be promoted for learning well. In this way, batches of apprentices quickly became masters. In the past four years, this system has been used to train millions of technical employees and develop the people's democratic cause in the Northeast.
    　　　　
    　　　　III. Dalian Shipyard Increases Shipbuilding Volume

    On September 29, we were granted permission by the Dalian Shipyard to visit this top shipyard in China. Before August 15, 1946, it was still a dilapidated shipyard; in 1949, it became a shipyard with rapidly increasing ship production and gradually modernizing equipment. The large and small shipyards were filled with workers working hard.

    China's shipbuilding industry has always been backward, not only lacking raw materials, but also lacking skilled workers. In the past four years, Soviet comrades have overcome these difficulties. In 1947, the Soviet Union introduced the shipbuilding method using cradles and the method of welding ship plates with electric fire to the shipyard and taught it to the Chinese workers. As a result, the production of ships has been greatly increased. In the past, Japanese shipbuilding did not know how to use the cradle method, and even less how to weld ship plates with electric fire, but only used the backward riveting method, so twelve people could only build one 50-ton ship in a month. Now, the same number of people can build one in five days, increasing the shipbuilding volume by six times.

    Soviet comrades not only taught the Chinese workers new methods of shipbuilding, but also introduced a new method of casting anchor chains that are essential for ships. Before we entered the anchor chain foundry, we never imagined such a good method of casting anchor chains. After we entered the factory, we saw the finished anchor chain models poured into molten iron to form an anchor chain of more than 100 tons. We exclaimed with novelty, "What a clever method!" In the Japanese era, anchor chains were forged and connected, which was not only time-consuming but also easy to break and costly. Now, having learned the Soviet method, the cost of the product is low, the output is high, and the quality is good. This enables the Dalian Shipyard to accelerate its development and lay a good foundation for the new China's shipbuilding industry.
    　　　　
    　　　　IV. The Railway Junction of the Two Great Friendly Nations of China and the Soviet Union

    Manzhouli and Suifenhe were Japanese military strongholds against the Soviet Union during the puppet Manchurian period. During the fourteen years of Japanese rule in the Northeast, the people of the Northeast were not allowed to go to these two places. Now, they have become the two great gates for friendly trade between China and the Soviet Union.

    In order to gain a deeper understanding of the on-site working conditions and to better integrate theory with practice, we obtained permission from the Railway Bureau to intern on train crews to Manzhouli and Suifenhe. At the platform in Manzhouli, we saw stacks of large boxes of industrial equipment and machinery and tractors shipped from the Soviet Union. On the tracks in Suifenhe, we saw Soviet oil tankers filling the tracks, with oil being continuously poured into Chinese oil tankers. What we transport to the Soviet Union is only China's surplus wool, soybeans, and other items. These concrete facts in these two places have made us more deeply aware of the Soviet Union. Only the socialist Soviet Union will sincerely help China. Isn't this sincere and friendly help a sharp contrast to the fact that during the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, American imperialism shipped glass skins, perfumes, and flour to fill the docks of Shanghai and Tianjin, in exchange for China's large quantities of tungsten sand and other precious industrial raw materials?! From this, we can see who is the enemy of the Chinese people, who is the friend of the Chinese people, who is invading China, and who is helping China. From this, we can also see the selfish and hypocritical face of American imperialism and the great internationalist spirit of Soviet socialism.
    　　　　
    　　　　V. The Endless Friendship Between the Peoples of China and the Soviet Union

    Before we went to the Harbin Chinese Changchun Railway Bureau for our internship, some students thought that the Soviets must be very fierce, like the barbaric Americans, and that the main power must be in the hands of the Soviets. But after we entered the Bureau and began our internship, we did not feel the fierceness of the Soviets. On the contrary, we felt that the Soviet comrades were very kind. When we encountered something we didn't understand in our work, they taught us very kindly. Sometimes, when we mispronounced the stress in Russian, they automatically helped us correct it. When we had the opportunity, we were also happy to teach them Chinese. The Soviet experts in the Bureau helped China improve its railways and improve the quality of railway employees. Every day, they tirelessly gave large classes on technical management regulations to Chinese workers and work cadres until they were exhausted and covered in sweat. Sometimes they spoke until their throats were hoarse and even forgot to eat.

    After we interned in the Harbin Bureau for a long time, we became more familiar with the Soviet comrades as we had more contact with them. Therefore, we said "dosvidanya" (Russian transliteration, meaning goodbye in Chinese) to each other every day when we got off work. When we met on the road or in the morning, we greeted each other with "zdrastvuite" (Russian transliteration, meaning hello in Chinese). Sometimes we shook hands with each other. They did not have the arrogant attitude of the Americans at all. One day, I went to the labor insurance cafeteria of the Harbin Locomotive Depot for dinner a little late. The cafeteria was full of people, and a Soviet comrade quickly squeezed closer to the person next to him, made a seat, and beckoned me to sit down. This scene moved me so much. The Soviet comrades treated us like their own brothers.

    Some Soviet comrades not only worked and ate with us, but also entertained with us. Many Chinese railway employees learned to dance Russian dances. During the internship, we held several get-togethers with railway employees. Sometimes there was a dance party after the get-together. We couldn't find many people who could dance, but under the enthusiastic applause of the Soviet comrades and Chinese employees, some of our students were so happy that even if they couldn't dance, they went to the dance floor to dance with them. Everyone's emotions were high, and the friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union was surging throughout the venue.

    In the Northeast, in Lushun-Dalian, where the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union cooperate concretely, the Soviet people everywhere show the great internationalist spirit of the proletariat. On the evening of September 30, we met two Soviet Red Army soldiers at the Dalian Railway Station who had fought on the European and Asian battlefields and defeated German and Japanese fascists. We chatted with them in simple Russian, new words, and gestures to express our meaning. We touched the three Stalin medals worn on the chest of one of the Red Army soldiers and looked at them repeatedly. He was so smiling and clasped his hands together to show that China and the Soviet Union will always be united and friendly! He also pointed his thumb at us, meaning "Chairman Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese people, is great," and pointed to the medals on his chest, meaning "Marshal Stalin, the leader of the people of the world, is great!" We talked and laughed, which made me feel the kind attitude of the Soviet Red Army, which is so kind, lovely, and admirable.
    　　　　
    　　　　VI. A Place Where the Friendship Between China and the Soviet Union is Concretely Manifested

    Under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the help of Soviet comrades, and the heroic struggle of the people of the Northeast, in the past four years, industry has been developed, culture has been promoted, and the people's political consciousness has been raised, so that everyone has recognized the Party and the Soviet Union. Therefore, the people responded to the call of the Party with great enthusiasm, and the workers worked with their greatest efforts in the posture of masters of the country. Li Qingrong, a labor hero from the Dalian Locomotive Depot, told us: "If it were not for the leadership of Chairman Mao of the Chinese Communist Party and the liberation of us by the Soviet Red Army, we would never be able to stand up and would always be slaves of the Japanese devils. Now, we are masters, and we will work harder to do our own work, guarantee the completion of tasks, and carry the revolutionary war to the end." From the Dalian Industrial Exhibition, we saw the brilliant achievements of the workers managing the factory themselves. It can be seen that the implementation of the Soviet rationalization proposal system has enabled the workers to fully develop their creativity and improve the people's construction cause. For example, the chemical precision balance with one hundred thousandth of a scale, manufactured by the Lushun-Dalian Metrology Factory in the Industrial Exhibition, under the painstaking research of worker Jia Yuanzhi, this valuable balance that is necessary for chemistry (which Japan had never manufactured in Dalian before), can now be created from the hands of our own Chinese workers starting this year.

    Dalian - this place where the friendly cooperation between China and the Soviet Union is concretely manifested. There are few people walking on the streets here during the day. People have gone to work in factories. At night, the clubs of various agencies and factories are filled with joy. The street literacy classes are crowded with people. They are all working to thoroughly implement the government's plan to basically eliminate illiteracy within two years. The cooperation between China and the Soviet Union in Dalian is essentially different from the concessions where imperialists enjoyed privileges in China. The former concessions were used by imperialists to invade China. The prosperity of the concessions was superficial prosperity, which was harmful to the Chinese people and not beneficial at all. Today's Dalian is where the Soviet Union has helped China build and ensure the safety of Lushun-Dalian. Its prosperity is internal and real prosperity. In the past four years, the Soviet Union has improved the lives of the people of Lushun-Dalian, raised the people's culture, and developed the industry of Lushun-Dalian, making today's Lushun-Dalian a pioneer in building a new democratic and new China.

    During the three months of internship and visits in the Northeast, because of what we personally experienced and saw with our own eyes, there is really no end to the deep friendship of the Soviet comrades for the Chinese people, and no end to the many facts of the Soviet Union helping China build the Northeast, which made us realize the great internationalist spirit of the Soviet Union. It also made us realize that only the Soviet Union is the most loyal friend of the Chinese people. We must learn from the Soviet Union, learn from the Soviet Union's advanced science and technology, and learn from the Soviet Union's experience in socialist construction. At the same time, we must learn from the moral character, work style, and great internationalist spirit of the Soviet people to defend world peace and build our new China.

　　苏联是中国人民最忠实的朋友
  　东北三月实习随记
    中国交通大学、北京管理学院  祝怿新
    我们很幸运，生长在毛泽东的时代里，让我们有机会去到东北实习和参观，使我们能和国际友人苏联同志与工人兄弟们愉快的生活在一块，学习他们的科学技术，吸取他们建设的经验，把在学校书本上学来的理论能与现场的实际工作结合起来，奠定我们将来更好的为人民事业服务的基础。
    在七月九日我们得到了人民政府的协助，离开了学校，去到了东北的铁路中心地——哈尔滨实习。我们在东北实习的期间，学校规定为三个月，以六分之五的时间实习，六分之一的时间参观。三个月的紧张而愉快的暑期生活，我们便按着这个预定的计划一步一步地进行。实习和参观的范围颇为广宽，不但到了东北最南的大连，最北的佳木斯，而且到了最东的绥芬河，最西的满洲里，普遍深入了广大的工人群，纵横了整个的东北。
    三个月的实际工作中教育了我们，使我们认识了无产阶级工人力量的伟大，初步的确立了劳动观点。同时，从许多的具体事实中，亲身体验到社会主义国家苏联的伟大的国际主义精神，它帮助中国改进了东北的铁路，恢复并发展了被破坏的东北工矿事业，使我们认清了“联共是我们最好的先生，我们应向联共学习。”这句中国人民领袖毛主席的指示，是千真万确的。
    　　　　一、吸取苏联经验，东北人民铁路进行空前大革命
    人民自己真正有权管理东北的铁路，仅有短短的四年历史，成绩辉煌，还超过伪满统治时代。这由于党的领导正确和苏联同志的帮助，推翻了伪满时代保守、落后与不科学的帝国主义殖民地化的管理制度，换来了进步、新式与科学的社会主义国家苏联三十年建设铁路经验结晶而成的管理制度，使中国的铁路管理制度上来了一个空前未有的大革命，缩短了车辆的周转率，提高了铁路的运输效能。
    我们在哈尔滨铁路局调度室实习调度后，才深切了解了苏联介绍来的新行车制度的优点。它赋与调度员极大的权力，使每个调度员发挥他高度的积极性、创造性，成为一个名符其实的行车指挥员。新旧两种行车制度前后对比一下，我们很容易明白旧的行车制度，是使每个调度员墨守成规的依照运行表办理列车的运行，好象一个呆板的纪录员，束缚了工人的创造性。由此便可证明资本主义国家与社会主义国家的管理制度是有其本质上的不同：一个是限制工人的创造性，一个则是尽量设法发挥工人的创造性。
    新行车制度推行后，很快地收到了惊人的效果，使车辆周转率由六点一缩短至二点八三，这打破了员工的保守思想及肓信日本一切都是好的错误想法。调度室的工友们说：“当苏联介绍新行车制度来时，我们都认为不及日本的好，一定行不通，行车会发生事故。但在党、政、工和苏联同志的努力下，终于克服了我们的偏向，结果试验成绩远较伪满时要好，搞通了我们的思想，使我们知道苏联老大哥的制度真好，要比日本好得多。”
    苏联不仅介绍一两种制度，而是介绍来了许多新制度，象乘务负责制、财务负责制、新养路法等办法。克服了以前资本主义企业无人负责，财务毫无计划，各部没有联系肓目生产的现象。当我们在列车上实习时，每到一站都看见司机很小心的检查和擦洗机车。有一次，我在滨绥线上的一辆机车上学习驾驶机车时，问一个姓夏的司机为什么你们到每一站都那么小心去检视？他说：“我们的机车就象农民自己的田一样，当然得要好好爱护它。”由于他的回答，使我深深感到这是实行了社会主义苏联介绍来的乘务负责制而替代了墨守成规落后的轮乘制所收到的效果，启发了司机们的责任感和创造性，使机车延长了寿命，增加了牵引力和工作效率。这是资本主义社会制度下不可能办到的事，也是资本主义国家从来也未梦想到的事。
    的确，四年来，东北铁路在党的领导和苏联同志的热心帮助下，吸取了苏联铁路建设经验，推行了科学的管理制度，打破了员工们保守的思想，消灭了“办铁路美国第一、日本第二”的错误想法，克服了路线延长车辆缺乏的困难，配合革命形势的需要与发展，大力地支援前线，完成了其所负的伟大运输任务。现在，东北铁路是中国铁路的示范区，站在铁路的最前列，领导着进行中国铁路有史以来空前未有的铁路大革命。
    　　　　二、我们的技术人员是怎样培养出来的？
    九月二十七日，我们在大连参观全国最大的铁路工厂——大连铁路工厂，这个庞大的工厂共包括二十七个分厂。在解放前该厂的每一精巧技术部门都是由日本人掌握，中国人只是干些粗工杂役的活，自从苏联红军解放后，大量提拔中国工人，教给技术，以便管理自己的工厂。该厂董厂长告诉我们：“解放前本厂有七○○○人，有四○○○是日本人，三○○○是中国的杂工。自红军来后，大量提升杂工培养技工，只要中国人学会了，苏联同志便让给中国人自己干。现在，本厂的许多分厂长都是从工人中提升上来的。目前，厂中共有七六○○人，只有七十六个苏联技术人员，四个日本人。”我们听到他这样说，同时我们也亲眼在厂里各单位看到成千的中国工人在努力地工作，我们不但看到中国的男技工，而且也看到不少的女技工，象著名全国的女劳动英雄戚桂芝，便是从这厂的杂工提升到技巧熟练的一位女镟盘工的好能手。
    旅大地区在日本统治下，工人是不准受较深的教育，所以铁路工厂的工人文化程度都很低，全厂从厂长到工友七千多人中只有一个高中毕业生，其余的都是初小或高小程度的。既然能把这么一个大工厂管理得有条不紊，并且保证完成任务，做到了生产超过计划，这是什么原因呢？这原因很简单，是由于共产党和工人阶级持有“不会我们就学会”的精神，在苏联同志的热心帮助下而获得的。
    在工厂内设有文化补习班，苏联同志为了教会中国工人的技术，竟不嫌厌烦地从数学的加减乘除教起。象该厂的科学研究所有十个研究生，都是初小程度的，而苏联同志为了培养中国专门人材，竟愿耐心地从化学的符号字母教起，至今成绩已不错了。
    为了使理论与实际结合，该厂所办的从前仅培养日本人而现在变成培养中国青年的技术学校，每星期有一半的时间实习。当我们参观时，见一个一个的青年学生在小型的实习工厂内实习，领我们参观的曲同志说：“他们实习的材料有的比较缺乏，须从莫斯科运来，但苏联同志不顾及缺乏，更不考虑价钱高，而仍然不断的供给他们实习，目的只在求他们的技术学得精。”
    帝国主义的国家是自私的，他们知道的不希望别人知道，希望自已垄断一切生产手段永远用来奴役其他民族。象铁工厂中的制动机分厂，便是日本所谓“农业中国，工业日本”的经济侵略的一个实例。它是一个车辆在制动时必须用的三动阀制造工厂，在日本时代从来不许外人进去，平时四周密布岗警，显得特别神秘。厂内有一个老工友对我们说：“我在铁路工厂干了三十多年的杂工，从来不晓得小鼻子（指日本），在这个厂内倒底干些什么？”是的，这就是帝国主义的本色，在日本统治下的中国人民，不但学不到技术，而且连看也不准看。社会主义国家的苏联同志情形就完全不同，他们不但让中国人学，而且想尽方法教会中国工人，帮助提高技术的水平。四年来，三动阀工厂的工人，在苏联同志的热心培养下，从今年起这个日本素来认为神秘的三动阀也能从咱们工人自己的手中制造出来了。粉碎了日本人说中国人学不好、掌握不了精巧技术的奴化思想的传播。
    不仅在大连铁路工厂得着苏联的帮助，解决了技术人员缺乏的问题，在旅大、在整个的东北工矿事业中，大多数都是得力于苏联的帮助，采用了他们科学的师傅带徒弟制度，师傅教会了徒弟可得到工厂的奖励，徒弟学好了可以得到提升。这样，一批一批的徒弟便很快的变成了师傅。四年来，利用这种制度培成了千百万技术员工，发展了东北的人民民主事业。
    　　　　三、大连船渠提高了造船量
    九月二十九日，我们得着大连船渠的允许，参观了这个中国数一数二的修造船厂。在一九四六年八一五前，它还是一个残破不堪的船渠；在一九四九年的现在，则变成一个产船量剧增逐渐趋向进代化设备的船渠。大的小的船渠内散满了工人，在努力的工作着。
    中国的造船工业一向落后，不但原料缺乏，技术工人也稀少，四年来，苏联同志都把这些困难克服了。并且在一九四七年，苏联把船胎造船法和用电火焊接船板法介绍到该船渠来，教会中国的工人。因此，使船的生产量大大地提高了。从前日本造船不知应用船胎法，更不会用电火焊接船板而只用落后的铆钉法，所以十二人一个月只能造一只五十吨的船，现在用同样的人工在五天之内便可造成一只，提高了六倍造船量。
    苏联同志不但教会了中国工人造船的新方法，而且介绍了在轮船上必需用的锚链新式铸制法。当我们未进入这个锚链翻砂工厂前，是从也想不到这么好的锚链铸制法，在我们进厂后，见到了做好的锚链模型灌进了熔化的铁液便成了一副百多吨的锚链。使我们看了很新奇似地喊出：“这个方法多巧秒呀！”在日本时，锚链用锻冶衔接，不但锻接费时，而且容易断，成本又高。现在，学会了苏联的方法，使产品的成本低、产量高、质量好。使大连船渠加速度向前发展，为新中国的造船事业打下一个良好的基础。
    　　　　四、中苏两大友好民族的铁路衔接处
    满洲里、绥芬河这两个在伪满时日本对付苏联的军事重地，日本统治东北的十四年中，东北的人民是不准到这两个地方去的。现在，则成了中苏两国友好通商进出口的两扇大门。
    我们为了对现场工作情况更深入一步，使理论与实际结合得更好起见，乃得着路局的允许，实习列车乘务到满洲里、绥芬河去。在满洲里的站台上，我们看见了堆满了一大箱一大箱从苏联运来的工业设备和机器、拖拉机。在绥芬河的轨道上，我们看见停满轨道的苏联油罐车，一车一车的石油正在不断的向着中国的油灌车内灌。而我们运至苏联去的只是中国剩余的羊毛大豆等物。由于这两地的具体事实，使我们更深地认识了苏联。只有社会主义苏联才会真诚来帮助中国。这种真诚友谊的帮助，与美帝国主义在国民党反动派统治时期，运来了玻璃皮包、香水和面粉堆满了上海天津的码头，用来换取中国的大批钨砂等珍贵的工业原料，不打一个尖锐的对比？！从这里看出了谁是中国人民的敌人，谁是中国人民的友人，谁是在侵略中国，谁是在帮助中国。从这里，我们也看出了美帝国主义的自私自利的虚伪面目，苏联社会主义的伟大的国际主义的精神。
    　　　　五、写不尽的中苏两国人民的友谊
    在我们未到哈尔滨中长路局去实习前，有的同学以为苏联人一定是很凶狠的，象美国人一样野蛮，并且以为主要职权一定在苏联人手中。但当我们进了路局开始实习后，并未感到苏联人的凶狠。相反，倒感觉到苏联同志令人可亲，我们遇到工作不懂时，他们很和气教给我们，有时我们俄文重音读差了时，他们自动的帮我们纠正，我们遇到机会也很乐意地去教他们的中文。路局里的苏联专家，帮助中国改进铁路，提高铁路从业员的素质，每天他们不顾疲劳累得满身大汗的替中国工人和工作干部上技术管理规程大课，有时讲得喉咙嘶哑了，连饭也忘了去吃。
    我们在哈局实习久了，与苏联同志也就随着接触久而更熟了，所以每天下班时彼此要来一声“多什维达尼亚”（俄音译，即中语再见意）。路上或早上碰见时彼此以“得拉斯基”（俄音译，中语你好意）相招呼，有时大家还握一握手，他们丝毫没有象美国人的一副臭架子。有一天，我到哈尔滨机务段劳保食堂去吃饭晚了一点，食堂坐满了人，一位苏联同志赶快向他旁边的人挤紧一些，让出一个位子招呼我坐，这种场面，太使我感动了。苏联同志真好比自己的兄弟般与我们相处。
    苏联同志有的不仅与我们同工作、共膳食，而且与我们在一块儿娱乐，有不少的中国人铁路员工学会了跳俄罗斯的舞。在实习期中，我们曾与铁路员工举行过好几次联欢会，在会后有时来一个舞会，我们找不到几个会跳的，但在苏联同志及中国员工的热烈掌声下，我们有的同学高兴得即使不会跳也到舞场上去同他们乱跳一阵，大家情绪高涨，中苏两国人民的友谊热忱澎湃着整个的会场。
    在东北，在中苏两大民族具体合作的旅大，苏联人民处处呈现着无产阶级伟大的国际主义精神。九月三十日的晚上，我们在大连车站遇到两个转战欧亚战场击败德日法西斯的苏联红军，我们用简单的俄语、生字和他们攀谈，作手势表达意思，我们用手摸着一个红军胸前佩带的三个斯大林勋章，反复的看着，他是那么笑容满面，用自己的两只手相互紧握着表示中苏永久是团结友好的！并且用大姆指对我们指着，意示“中国人民领袖毛泽东主席是伟大的”，又用手指胸前的勋章，意示“世界人民领袖斯大林元帅是伟大的”！我们谈着笑着，使我感到苏联红军的那种和蔼态度，真令人可亲可爱可敬佩。
    　　　　六、中苏两国友好具体表现的地方
    在中国共产党的正确领导，苏联同志的帮助和东北人民的英勇奋斗下，四年来，发展了工业，开展了文化，提高了人民的政治觉悟，使大家认识了党，也认识了苏联。因此，人民以高度的热忱来响应党的号召，工人以国家主人的姿态用最大的努力来从事生产。大连机务段劳动英雄李庆荣对我们说：“假若没有中国共产党毛主席的领导和苏联红军解放我们，我们是一辈子也翻不了身，永远要做日本鬼的奴隶。现在，我们是作主人了，我们将以加倍的努力来干自己的活，保证完成任务，把革命战争进行到底。”从大连工展中，我们看到了工人自己管理工厂所收的辉煌成绩，可以见到因推行了苏联的合理化建议制度，使工人充分发挥了自己的创造性，改进了人民的建设事业。象工展中的旅大度量衡工厂所制造的十万分之一的化学精密天秤，在工友贾元治的苦心钻研下，这种珍贵的化学上必须用的天秤（以前日本在大连时也没制造过），从今年开始也能从咱们中国自己的工人手中创造出来了。
    大连——这个中苏两国友好合作具体表现的地方，在这里的街上，白天很少人走路，人们都到工厂做工去了。而晚上在各个机关工厂的俱乐部里，又充满了一片欢乐声，在街识字班里挤满了人，他们都在为彻底执行政府两年内基本消灭文盲的计划，中苏在大连的合作是与帝国主义在中国享受特权的租界有其本质上的不同。以前的租界是帝国主义用来侵略中国的，租界的繁荣，是表面的繁荣，对中国人民有百害无一利的。而今日的大连是苏联用了帮助中国建设保障旅大安全，它的繁荣是内在的真实的繁荣。四年来，苏联在旅大，改善了旅大人民的生活，提高了人民的文化，发展了旅大工业，使今日的旅大成为建设新民主主义新中国的先锋。
    在东北三个月的实习和参观过程中，由于我们亲身体验到的，亲眼看到的，真有说不完的苏联同志对中国人民的深厚友谊，写不尽的苏联帮助中国建设东北的许多事实，使我们认识了苏联伟大的国际主义精神。也使我们认识了，只有苏联是中国人民最忠实的友人。我们要向苏联学习，学习苏联先进的科学技术，学习苏联社会主义建设的经验，同时，我们要学习苏维埃人的道德品质，工作作风和伟大的国际主义精神，来保卫世界和平，来建设我们的新中国。
