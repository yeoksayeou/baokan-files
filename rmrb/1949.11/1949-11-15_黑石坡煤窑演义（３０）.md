    Black Stone Slope Coal Kiln Chronicle (30)
    Xi Lu has also changed a lot. He no longer wears a gown, and the sheepskin jacket he wears has no lining. His cotton pants and shoes are very worn. He is also thinner and darker, and his beard is much longer than before. He doesn't seem as energetic as he used to be. When he saw Da San, he didn't mention anything about the kiln. He only asked if Da San had found any work. Da San said he hadn't. Xi Lu offered to let him farm his one mu of land on Ghost Face Slope, and said he still wouldn't charge rent, just have him pay the land tax. Da San felt that this man was truly different from others. He wanted to thank him, but couldn't find the words, so he casually said, "Is your big kiln still salvageable?" Xi Lu said, "My big kiln? Where do I have a big kiln? Don't you know? @He mother's, I lost so much money on land and fields! The account at Willow Ditch, that eats people, doubled in interest in less than a year, and I paid it back! I also gave some money for temple repairs, and I guess I don't owe too much! Hey! But @he mother's, Qian Danao just bit off a mouthful, saying I was short so much and so much, and showed me a whole bunch of accounts! What am I supposed to see! Alas... it's my own fault! I got angry and said recklessly, 'I don't want the kiln!' Good! They seized on that, and muddled through saying my kiln covered the temple repair debt! They even said it was being lenient! My kiln now belongs to the old man of Ju Bao! What a good old man! But he still hides it, saying the kiln is half his and half the temple's! I don't know who the temple really belongs to!" As Xi Lu spoke, he stood up, as if he were angry at someone. His face was red, and he was breathing heavily. He paced back and forth in the room, coughing constantly. Suddenly, he stopped, staring straight at Da San and said, "I've heard people say the kiln wasn't destroyed, but what's the use of saying it? What good would it do? @He mother's, this world is ruined!" Hearing these words, Da San felt as if something hard was stuck in his heart. If he didn't say something, it felt like he couldn't spit it out. So he squatted down and covered his head with both hands, saying, "This world, @he mother's! Anyone who wants to work hard and do honest business is doomed! Just listen! One moment it's this group, the next it's that association, then it's the governor or the military governor, and now it's the damn Japanese devils' 'Kingdom of Righteousness'! Not one of them can do anything right! Unless you go against your conscience and collude with them, but even then, they won't let you do anything honest! This world is ruined!" Xi Lu quickly followed up, "Right! Da San, haven't we spent our whole lives carefully calculating and running around? And isn't this what we've ended up with? They took my kiln, but aren't they just letting it be destroyed? We've seen through it! Da San, I don't think your skills will work in this world! Forget about it! Don't even mention the kiln anymore!" These words struck a chord with Da San, but he still felt unwilling. But he didn't say anything more, just sat blankly for a long time before leaving.

    Twenty-seven  Carrying Loads

    Tian Lu and Shuan Cheng helped Da San dig a cave dwelling. Da San still had a little money, and bought some old clothes and bedding to make a home. Da San also discussed with Tian Lu and decided to let Tian Lu work exclusively at the Willow Ditch kiln. He took on all the planting work for his and Tian Lu's rented land, along with his second sister-in-law and nephews, and worked with Shuan Cheng. Tian Lu was happy to do this, so Da San took out Tian Lu's old farm tools, cleaned them up, and planned to learn how to farm, and not work in the kiln anymore.

    The weather was slowly getting warmer! One morning, Da San got up and walked out of the cave. He looked up and saw two apricot trees on the opposite slope, blooming overnight with white apricot blossoms. He went back into the cave, took a teapot, filled it with water, and picked a large bunch of apricot blossoms to put in the pot. He brought it back into the cave, and since there wasn't even a table, he put the flowers on the kang (heated platform bed). He remembered that he had completed the construction of the East Entrance kiln in the village when the apricot blossoms bloomed that year. At this moment, Tian Lu came in. Da San asked, "Didn't you just go to work? Why are you back so soon?" Tian Lu, smoking a dry pipe, went straight to sit on the kang, not even noticing the flowers. Da San quickly moved the teapot away, and then heard Tian Lu say, "The Willow Ditch kiln is flooded!" Da San stared with wide eyes and said, "Ah! How?" Tian Lu said, "The water was discovered at the second crow of the rooster this morning!" Da San suddenly felt as if his heart was filled with water. He paced back and forth in the cave, wringing his hands. Tian Lu got off the kang, squatted down by the stove, and didn't say anything more.

    After that, Tian Lu only ate when he could, working the land. Da San's one mu of land didn't require much work, but the cost of food and drink was tight. He really had nothing to do. Suddenly, he remembered when he escaped from the Tongpu Railway line, in the village where the sentry checked him, he said he was from Black Stone Slope in Pingding. Someone in that village said Black Stone Slope was near Little West Village, and some people had carried sandstone goods to Little West Village. Someone also said that fewer people were carrying sandstone goods in the last two years, and they couldn't even buy it there. Thinking of this, he decided to pick up a carrying pole and try his luck carrying sandstone goods.

    He knew the roads well, and went west to Yu County and Shouyang to carry sandstone goods a few times. The business was indeed good, so he kept at it. Slowly, many acquaintances from the village came to him and went with him to carry sandstone goods. Tian Lu and Shuan Cheng also went a few times. Every time he went out with a few partners, he always let their goods be sold first, and let them go back first. He would rather run an extra half day. Sometimes people were embarrassed, and he would say, "I'm alone, if I'm full, then my whole family is full. You have several mouths waiting to be fed at home! You should sell and go back first! Besides, I know the roads well, so it's easier for me than you." In this way, Da San unconsciously made some friends again. These friends wouldn't pool money to buy wine, nor would they shout about things from all over the world. They would just rest in his cave for half a day when they had free time, smoking pipe after pipe, saying a few words, or not saying a word at all, and then leave when it was time. Da San felt that this life was also a bit interesting. He earned some more money, and added some old clothes and old furniture. He threw away the top hat that was too worn to wear and bought a new one. He lived a clean and tidy life again. He firmly made up his mind: he would never work in the kiln again, he would just farm and carry loads.

    Twenty-eight  Coercion

    However, Da San didn't live like this for long.

    The harvest this year wasn't bad, but Da San's rented one mu of land, after paying the land tax, didn't have much left over for himself. Da San asked Shuan Cheng, "Why is the land tax so heavy?" Shuan Cheng said, "If you farm Ju Bao's good flat land, then the differential tax is a bargain, but they insist that you pay rent in rice! If you farm poor land, even in a bumper year, you might be able to pay the tax and have a little left over. Anyway, the tax is the same per mu, regardless of whether the land is good or bad. For poor people who rent land, this world is always a loss!" Da San said, "Didn't Xi Lu just rent me one mu of land? He's never rented out other land, and he's never been a proper rich man, and he can't be said to be in good shape now! But he's still so controlling!" Shuan Cheng laughed, "Uncle Da San, didn't you say before? Uncle Xi Lu treats you well because he wants to use your skills to make money for him! His abacus is famous far and wide! Have you forgotten what you said yourself?" Da San said, "How could I forget! But sometimes when I think about the controls he suffered, I feel a little sorry for him. Oh well, never mind! Let's go pay the tax!" As he said that, he went back to settle the land tax.

    Da San walked out of Shuan Cheng's house and ran into Tian Lu. Tian Lu had just paid the tax and told Da San, "Third Brother, they're urging you to send the tax money!" Da San said, "The land tax? I'll go right now." Tian Lu said, "They also want you to send the quarterly payment." Da San was surprised and said, "What else?" Tian Lu said, "The quarterly payment! Twice a year, whether you have land or not, everyone has to pay twenty-five jin of wheat per quarter. Qian Danao said you didn't pay the spring quarter either!" When Da San heard this, his eyes widened again! He spent money whenever he had it, who knew there were so many donations and taxes! He couldn't help but get angry! He turned his face away and strode back, thinking: I might as well not send the land tax! To hell with it! See what happens!

    Unexpectedly, Da San's delay angered Qian Danao greatly. Originally, when Da San first returned to the village, Ju Bao saw that he didn't have much money, so he let him go. Qian Danao even forgot to assign the spring quarter payment to him. Later, Da San needed to get a travel permit to sell sandstone goods, and the village custom was that you had to give a few coins to get a travel permit. Da San had never given any. Yu Bao, who was in charge of travel permits, was embarrassed to say anything, but he didn't like his attitude, so he told Qian Danao about the situation. These days, Qian Danao had vaguely heard people say that Da San often gathered a bunch of people to his cave dwelling, which also made him uneasy. Besides, he also saw that Da San was dressed and eating well these days: he discussed it with Ju Bao and decided to deal with Da San. Now that Da San was in arrears with his payment, he erupted and sent Yu Bao to call Da San.

    黑石坡煤窑演义（３０）
    喜禄也变多了。他不穿大褂了，披的一件羊皮袄也没褂布面，棉裤棉鞋都很破旧；人也瘦了也黑了，胡子比过去多得多，精神也不象往日那么好。他见了大三，窑上的事一点没提，只问大三找了营生没有，大三说没干的，喜禄就还把鬼脸坡那一亩地给他养种，并说还是不要租米，只叫代掏地亩款；大三觉着这人倒真是不比别人，想说两句什么谢谢人家，却没的说，便随口道：“你那大窑可还能拾掇哩！”喜禄说：“我那大窑？我哪还有什么大窑？你还不知道么？＠他妈的我赔了买卖地亩现款那么些，柳沟那笔吃人的帐，不到一年就本对利滚了一倍，那我也还了！修庙款也给了一些，短吧欠吧估量也多不到哪里去！嘿！可他妈的乾大脑就胡咬一嘴，说我短这么些那么些的，还一大堆帐叫我看！我看个球！唉……也怪我自己！那阵子一生气，就横着心说了句：窑不要了！好！人家就抓住了这，稀里糊涂地说是我的窑顶了修庙欠款！还说那是宽大我！我那窑这就归了聚宝老人家啦！真是好个老人家！可他还遮遮掩掩地说窑是他一半庙上一半哩！也不知那庙到底是谁的！”喜禄说着说着就站了起来，让跟谁生气一般，脸红了，嘴里直出大气，急忙忙在屋里来回走着，一边不断地“咳！咳！”忽然，他立住了，眼直望着大三说：“那窑我也听人说过没毁了，可那有啥说的？说了又有啥用？＠他妈的这世道就毁了嘛！”大三听了这话，心里头虽受得象是卡住了一块什么硬东西，不说两句话吧，这硬东西仿佛就吐不出来；于是他往地下一圪＠，俩巴掌捂着脑袋说：“这世道，＠他妈的！谁们要想实心实意操劳着干点正经营生，准没闹！光听吧！一会是这个团那个会，一会又是都督督军，这会又是他妈东洋外国鬼子“王道乐土”！没一个能干人事的！除非你黑着良心跟人家勾扯上，可就那吧，人家也不叫你干正经事！可不这世道就是毁啦！”喜禄连忙接着说道：“对！大三，咱这不是细打细算跑跳了一辈子？可还不是闹下个这？人家把我那窑闹去了吧，不还是让它毁着？咱算是看透啦！大三，我看这世道你那把式也没闹！算球啦吧！再也甭说窑啦！”这话也碰着了大三的心，不过他总还觉着不怎么甘心；但他也没再说什么，只是直＠地呆了老半天才走。
    二十七  担脚
    天禄和拴成帮大三也刨了个窑洞，大三还有两个钱，买了些衣被破烂，凑合安了个家。大三又和天禄商议好了，让天禄专一去柳沟大窑动弹，他连自己的和天禄的租种地都跟他二嫂侄儿们一道包揽上，和拴成参忙着干。天禄也乐意这么办，大三就把天禄那些破农具搬出来打整拾掇，盘算好好学着养种养种地，不干窑了。
    天气慢慢暖和了！有一天早晨，大三起来走出窑外，一抬眼，看见对面坡上两株杏树，一夜就开满了白白的杏花，他就回到窑里，拿了把砂壶，盛满水，摘了一大把杏花插在壶里，再拿回窑来，窑里连个桌子也没有，他便把花搁到炕头上，一边却想起：他开村里的东口大窑，也正是那年开杏花的时候大完工的。这时天禄进来了，大三问道：“你不是刚去上班，怎么就回来了？”天禄抽着旱烟，直往炕头上坐去，也没注意那花；大三忙拿开砂壶，一边却听见天禄说：“柳沟大窑也淹啦！”大三瞪着两只圆眼道：“啊！怎么？”天禄说：“今个鸡叫二遍那工夫刨出的水！”大三心中突然也象灌满了水一样地难受，就抄着两手在窑里来回大步走着；天禄走下炕来，往火炉跟前一圪＠，再也没说话。
    以后天禄就吃了上顿没下顿地上地；大三一亩地费不了什么工，吃喝却紧的不行，实在也没干的，猛地忽然想起他从同蒲铁道边逃跑出来，在那个岗哨查住他的村里，他说他是平定黑石坡人，那村就有人说黑石坡是小西庄左近的村子，那里并有人上小西庄担过砂货，还有人说这二年担砂货的人少了，那边想买也买不到。他想到这，就决意挑扁担担砂货出去碰碰去。
    他出门多道路熟，往西去盂县寿阳担了几遭砂货，买卖果真不赖，他便一个劲干开了。慢慢地村里就有不少熟人找上门来，跟他一道出去担砂货，天禄拴成也去过几遭。他每回碰几个伙计一道挑担出去，到了外边，总是让人家的货先卖，卖了让人家先回，他宁愿多跑一半天；有时人家不好意思，他就说：“我一个人，自己个吃饱了，就算一家子通饱了，你们家里还有几口嘴等着吃哩！你们先卖先回吧！再说，我道儿熟，比你们方便。”这么一来，大三不觉又交结上了一些朋友，这些朋友不会一道拿钱买酒，也不会扯开嗓门咯嚷天南地北，只是闲空时候，去他窑里歇半天，旱烟抽了一袋又一袋，说三两句话，或是一句也不说，到该走的时候就走了。大三觉着这光景也有点意思，他又挣了俩钱，就又添了些估衣旧家什，把过去那顶破得不能再戴的礼帽撂了，另买了顶半新的，他又一个人干干净净地过开了日子；他并实踏实地拿住了主意：往后怎么也再不闹窑，就这么种种地挑挑扁担。
    二十八  逼迫
    不过，这样的日子大三也没过上两天。
    这年年景还不算赖，但大三租种的一亩地，除了代掏地亩捐，自己就没什么剩头了。大三问拴成道：“怎么地亩捐这么重？”拴成说：“要是养种聚宝老人家的好平地，那代差才占便宜，可人家又非叫你掏租米！养种赖地嘛，碰对个十成年景吧，还许能掏了差款再落点。反正差款不分好赖地都一样按亩摊。靠租种地的穷人，这世道还不怎么也是吃亏！”大三说：“喜禄不就是租给了我一亩地么？别的他从来也没出租过地，他也从来没当上过正经财主，如今更是说不上什么光景了！可他也这么克制人啦！”拴成笑道：“大三叔，过去你不是说过么？喜禄叔待你好点子吧，还不是为了使唤你的把式，让你好好给他挣钱！他一手算盘是远近有名的哩！你莫非忘了你自己说过的话啦？”大三道：“哪会忘！可有时想起他受的那些克制，也真有点可怜他。唉，管球哩！掏款去吧！”说着，就回去安顿地亩捐去了。
    大三走出拴成家，正好碰见天禄。天禄刚缴了差款回来，告大三道：“老三，催你送差款去哩！”大三道：“地亩捐么？我这就去。”天禄说：“还有季款也叫你一道送去。”大三吃惊道：“还有什么？”天禄说：“季款！一年两季，有地没地的反正一人一季二十五斤麦。乾大脑说，你春季的也没掏哩！”大三一听，眼又瞪圆了！他平日有钱就花，谁知还有这么些捐款啊！这可不由得他不生气！他撇过脸大步走着回去了，心想：干脆地亩捐也不送球啦！拖你妈的！看怎么着！
    不想大三这一拖，就惹得乾大脑大动肝火。原来大三刚回村的时候，聚宝见他没什么油水，就撂过了他，乾大脑并且连春季季款也忘了给他派。后来大三短不了开路条出去卖砂货，村里习惯是开路条总得给俩钱的，大三却没给过，玉宝管路条，也不大好意思说他，但又不服他这劲，就对乾大脑学说这情由；乾大脑这些天又隐隐忽忽听人说：大三短不了聚上一堆人去他住的窑里捣拉，这也叫他放心不下；再说，他也见大三这些时穿戴吃喝象模象样的：他就和聚宝商议好了，要拾掇拾掇大三。现在正碰上大三欠款不缴，他便发作起来，打发玉宝叫大三去。
