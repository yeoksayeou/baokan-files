Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 17th: TASS, New York, November 15th -- Vyshinsky, head of the Soviet delegation to the United Nations General Assembly, delivered a speech at the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly on November 14th regarding the Soviet proposal to condemn new war preparations and conclude a five-power pact to strengthen peace. The full text is as follows:

On September 23rd, the Soviet delegation, on the instructions of the Soviet government, submitted to the General Assembly proposals regarding the condemnation of new war preparations and the conclusion of a five-power pact to strengthen peace.

In simple terms, these proposals are as follows: (1) To condemn the new war preparations being carried out by certain countries, particularly the United States and Great Britain. (2) To recognize that the use of atomic weapons and other means of mass destruction of humanity is contrary to the conscience and honor of all peoples and incompatible with the status of a member of the United Nations. The United Nations must no longer delay taking concrete measures for the unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons and the establishment of appropriate strict international control. (3) To express the desire for joint efforts by the five major powers—the United States, Great Britain, China, France, and the Soviet Union—to avert the threat of a new war and for them to conclude a pact to strengthen peace.

　　　　The Soviet Union Consistently Defends the Cause of Peace

These proposals are the natural result of the diplomatic policy consistently adhered to by the Soviet government since the establishment of the Soviet state. The first action of the Soviet state was to proclaim the historic Decree on Just and Democratic Peace in November 1917. This is a manifestation of the principled direction that the Soviet Union, existing for thirty-two years, has been following since its first day. The Soviet Union has always upheld and continues to uphold this direction in the United Nations. It should be remembered that at the First Session of the United Nations General Assembly in 1946, the Soviet government proposed the implementation of universal disarmament and troop reductions. This proposal became the basis for the General Assembly's historic resolution of December 14, 1946. With this proposal, the Soviet government expressed its firm will for universal peace and its willingness to engage in peaceful competition in national socio-economic affairs and social systems. At the Second Session of the United Nations General Assembly in 1947, the Soviet government undertook the lofty task of being the first to condemn any form of propaganda for a new war. At the Third Session of the United Nations held in Paris in 1948, the Soviet Union, in furtherance of the cause of peace and international cooperation, further proposed that the five major powers reduce their troops and armaments by one-third, prohibit atomic weapons, and establish an international control agency within the Security Council to supervise and control the implementation of the above measures. However, this proposal was rejected by the majority in the General Assembly who obediently followed the United States and Great Britain in opposing the Soviet Union's peace-loving proposals. It must be pointed out that similar proposals put forward by the Soviet representative in the Security Council also met with the same fate. The United States and Great Britain have consistently and systematically rejected all previous proposals against new war preparations and for consolidating peace within the United Nations!

The proposals now put forward by the Soviet Union are a continuation of the principled direction that the Soviet Union has consistently adhered to. This direction is to defend peace and international cooperation, and to oppose the threat of a new war being prepared by a very small number of adventurers and pursuers of world hegemony. The Soviet Union's proposals to eliminate the threat of a new war and strengthen peace are once again a loud call to the world against the new slaughter being prepared by the aggressive bloc led by the United States and Great Britain. Can anyone oppose the Soviet proposals to condemn new war preparations, prohibit atomic weapons, establish strict international control, and conclude a five-power pact to strengthen peace? No one can oppose the Soviet proposals except the enemies of peace and international cooperation, except those who regard new war preparations and new wars as the source of their wealth, except those who seek to establish world hegemony and enslave other countries through new wars!

　　　　War Profiteers Attempt to Obstruct Soviet Proposals

Undoubtedly, the only ones who oppose such proposals are the incorrigible opponents of peace, the representatives of reactionary groups who make a living by preparing for war and who see war as a source of wealth. Sumner Slichter, a professor at Harvard University and one of the representatives of the American reactionary groups, openly admitted this. He shamelessly said at a meeting of representatives of the financial and industrial sectors: The "cold war" against the Soviet Union is a "good thing." The "cold war" can increase the demand for goods, help maintain a high level of employment, accelerate technological progress, and thus help the country improve its living standards. Slichter also said: "Without the 'cold war,' the government's demand for goods would be tens of billions of dollars less than it is now, and the expenditure of industry and the government on technological research would also be tens of billions of dollars less than it is now. Therefore, we are very grateful to the Soviet Union for making American capitalism run unprecedentedly well."

These shameless words of this arrogant and ignorant Harvard professor would not be worth talking about if he had not exposed the true motives of the war profiteers' sabotage activities. Unfortunately, such facts are not isolated. People in the United States and certain other countries can still feel the instigation of the reactionary groups in these countries, which are inciting a war atmosphere. Indeed, in this camp, one can hear the barking and hostile denunciation of the Soviet Union's peace-loving proposals. At this session of the General Assembly, the united slanderous attacks of the Kuomintang delegation, the Tito group delegation, and other delegations under the command of the United States and British delegations, i.e. anti-Soviet forces. Have we not seen with our own eyes here that distortions and malicious fabrications are used to oppose the Soviet Union? There is no doubt that in the future there will still be people coming out of this camp to oppose the Soviet proposals, fabricating all kinds of evasions, and putting forward all kinds of suggestions to defeat the Soviet proposals. These proposals expose the unsavory plans of the instigators of a new war. The leaders of the American and British groups had already sent out signals to attack the Soviet proposals at the beginning of this session of the General Assembly.

The main point of Bevin's speech to the General Assembly on September 26 was precisely this. He began that day by talking about the Soviet Union and the proposals made by the Soviet Union on September 23. In his own colors, Bevin attempted to describe these Soviet proposals and the entire foreign policy of the Soviet Union as a "serious blow" to the establishment of cooperation in the United Nations. The fact that the Soviet Union has consistently struggled to strengthen the influence and role of the United Nations (which is an important tool for peace) and to correctly abide by the UN Charter for the sake of sincere and consistent international cooperation is evident throughout Soviet foreign policy, many documents, and the repeated statements made by the Soviet delegation in the United Nations since the First Session of the General Assembly in 1946. Bevin, however, made such a distortion of Soviet foreign policy.

Bevin attacked Soviet foreign policy and tried to justify the reactionary measures of the North Atlantic Treaty, the Brussels Treaty, the division of Germany, the arms race, and the preparation for a new war, attempting to blame all this on the Soviet Union and Soviet foreign policy. He also spoke specifically about the German problem in that speech, although this problem has nothing to do with the United Nations, and Bevin attempted to shift the responsibility for the so-called Berlin crisis to the Soviet Union. Therefore, he wanted to discredit the Soviet government's proposal to condemn new war preparations and conclude a five-power pact to strengthen peace. If we are to talk about the "Berlin crisis," is there anyone who does not know that it was entirely created by the United States and British governments? It was they who created the so-called "Berlin crisis" in order to cover up their policy of splitting Germany. It was they who attempted to create new disputes on this issue, artificially provoke railway workers' strikes, and incite German workers against the Berlin Soviet military government through police provocations. It was they who obstructed the resolution of the Berlin issue in Paris, preventing an early agreement between the representatives of the six so-called neutral countries and the Soviet representative. The destroyers of the Yalta and Potsdam agreements have now brought their actions of refusing to fulfill their international obligations under the aforementioned agreements to a climax by establishing a separate puppet West Germany, the so-called Bonn government. Relying on despicable lies and slanders, they insisted that the Soviet government would rather risk war than give up its purpose of controlling Berlin, as Bevin said on September 26.

All these fabrications are needed by Bevin in order to poison the political atmosphere in advance and divert people's attention from the Soviet proposals, to undermine trust in these proposals that are conducive to strengthening peace and international cooperation, which is precisely the goal that the Soviet government is striving to achieve.

Later speeches by representatives of the American and British groups have shown that Bevin's signal has been accepted. For example, instead of seriously recognizing the importance of the Soviet Union's proposal to strengthen peace, the Canadian representative indulged in anti-Soviet slanders and fabrications about "new imperialism in the post-war period," and indulged in absurd fabrications about the Soviet Union establishing "domination" in its neighboring countries. The Canadian representative certainly knows that not a word he said about the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries is true. But what is truth to him? It is important to him to stir up trouble.

What the Canadian representative said about the substance of the Soviet proposals proves that the crux of the matter is not of interest to him. So he described these proposals as pure propaganda in order to push away the Soviet proposals. This is a cliché, and it is completely unconvincing. The Soviet proposals are not propaganda, because the fact that the United States, Great Britain, and their accomplices are conducting a frenzied arms race is a fact, the fact that military budgets are increasing, and the welfare of the people is further violated, and their burdens are becoming heavier is also a fact. The fact that the United States and Great Britain are constantly preparing for a new war, which is manifested in the establishment of many land, sea, and air force bases in the United States, and in the organization of military groups that pursue aggressive purposes and oppose peace-loving countries, all this is not propaganda, but facts.

This is a fact, not propaganda – in the United States, right before our eyes, an outrageous discussion is unfolding, that is, the discussion between representatives of the United States Air Force and representatives of the United States Navy about the best methods of attacking peace-loving countries, about the best methods of eliminating hundreds of millions of people, destroying peaceful cities and entire countries, and this discussion cannot even be found in the history of the most reactionary aggressive countries.

People like Canadian Foreign Minister Pearson describe the exposure of this barbaric and shameless "work" done by that small group of imperialists who are preparing new and most serious crimes against humanity as a kind of "propaganda." But the problem is not propaganda, but lies in uniting all the efforts of all honest people, preventing the new crimes of the pursuers of world hegemony, seizing the evil hand of the war-mongers pressed on the heads of all peace-loving countries! But if we are to talk about propaganda, then it should be noted that the statement made by US Secretary of Defense Johnson on August 1949 at the US Senate Committee discussing the military assistance program. He said: "In Western Europe, the military vacuum has become a great attraction to international communism." If this is not anti-Soviet war propaganda, if this is not a direct incitement to such a war, what else could it be?

It can be seen from this that the Canadian representative especially dislikes the point mentioned in the third item of the Soviet proposal, that is, the powerful people's movement in all countries striving for peace and opposing war-mongers. Pearson said: This has a specific meaning in the communist vocabulary. But Pearson and his entourage should know that the word "peace" in all vocabularies means peace, and these two words have become the banner of hundreds of millions of people around the world, the guiding North Star, guiding those who are fully determined to stop new bloody massacres, guiding those who are fully determined to stop the madness of a new war that threatens to turn millions of cities into rubble and hundreds of millions of people into skeletons! The people of the world do not want war, they demand peace! And this growing demand for peace comes from all countries that call for saving and benefiting mankind! This is a rising sun, and all reactionaries and obscurantists disappear under this bright and benevolent sunshine! What angers Pearson and his group is this people's movement for peace, this group seeing the bankruptcy of their own aggressive plans in the people's desire for peace. Here, the Tito group representative sympathetically echoed the Canadian representative, also attempting to describe the Soviet proposals as a kind of propaganda, and using the discussion of these proposals as an excuse for new slanders against the Soviet Union.

These examples are sufficient to show very clearly that the Soviet government's noble proposals have caused chaos in the camp planning a new war, and this camp will take measures to thwart the proposals put forward by the Soviet government at this session on September 23. This is a peace plan that is in the interests of the Soviet people and the country, but is irrelevant to those who practice expansion and colonial conquest. This peace plan is in the interests of all progressive mankind and all peace-loving people. This is why the instigators of a new war are attacking this plan. If this plan is realized, it will mean the failure of the policy of military adventure. This policy of military adventure has made the ruling groups of certain countries, especially the United States and Great Britain, greatly exposed.

　　　　Condemn New War Preparations

The Soviet representative proposed to condemn the new war preparations being carried out in certain countries, especially the United States and Great Britain.

The Second Session of the United Nations held in New York unanimously passed a resolution condemning new war propaganda in any form. We still remember that at that time, the US representative Austin openly said that the draft proposed by the Soviet Union on condemning war propaganda should be frustrated in advance. The US delegation did not succeed in doing so, and did not prevent the passage of the resolution on condemning war propaganda. However, it must be admitted that in the two years since then, no one has been able to catch up with the American reactionary groups in actually undermining this resolution and making it lose any real meaning. Not only that. In these few years, in some countries, especially in the United States and Great Britain, war propaganda has not only not declined, but has grown to a more frenzied and hysterical degree. (Original missing a small paragraph - Editor)

At the same time, the opposition of the democratic forces to this propaganda is continuing to grow, and the democratic forces have hundreds of millions of peace supporters, who are declaring more and more powerfully against the propaganda of a new war. In April 1949, the World Congress of Defenders of Peace held in Paris and Prague was attended by 561 national organizations striving for peace and 12 international organizations participating in the peace movement, representing 600 million organized peace supporters. Despite all the obstacles encountered by the organizers of the conference, such as the opposition of the French authorities to the work of the Paris Peace Conference, the conference achieved the above-mentioned goals. Not only within one country, but also internationally, hundreds of millions of people have united to establish their task, which is to stop new massacres, and to prevent the aggressors from realizing the evil conspiracy of peace and international peaceful cooperation. This powerful people's movement for peace is a reliable guarantee for the failure of war and the victory of peace! In his speech commemorating the 32nd anniversary of the Great October Revolution, Malenkov said: "The massive peace movement proves that the people have become a force capable of containing aggressors." And what angers the enemies of peace and the instigators of a new war even more is the achievement of the people's movement for peace.

But the fact remains the fact! New war propaganda has not stopped, and has been supported and encouraged by some governments, especially the governments of the United States and Great Britain, up to now. And they still keep singing the high tune of "peace" and "international cooperation" to cover themselves up.

The problem now is not just war propaganda. The problem lies in the practical measures that have been taken to prepare for war, and the formulation of strategic military plans. These measures show that the threat of war has gone beyond the stage of verbal talk and entered the stage of practical action, material and organizational measures. On this issue, measures such as the establishment of the North Atlantic Alliance (the people who preside over this alliance are trying their best to cover up its aggressive nature with fabricated words such as defense, peace, and security) are designated to play an important role. But the hypocrisy of the words "defense," "peace," and "security" can be exposed by the fact that on the one hand, it opposes peace-loving countries, and on the other hand, it includes some countries that are not in the North Atlantic region. This fully reveals the aggressive plan of the North Atlantic Alliance. This alliance represents a stubborn and die-hard group of countries, and what is especially important is that it completely ignores the possibility of the resurgence of German aggression. The truly defensive treaties of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries are to prevent the resurgence of German aggression. It is worth noting that among the major powers that participated in the anti-Hitler alliance, only the Soviet Union did not participate in this North Atlantic Treaty. The purpose of the North Atlantic Treaty is anti-Soviet, and it is an aggressive treaty. As long as you look at the fact that the Soviet Union did not participate in it, there is no room for doubt, no matter what words the participants and organizers of this treaty fabricate to create a smokescreen!

In their speeches at the General Assembly, Mr. Acheson and Mr. Bevin attempted to prove that the North Atlantic Treaty and the Brussels Treaty were to promote peace and international cooperation and did not pursue any aggressive purposes. But even a newspaper like the Wall Street Journal, when talking about the North Atlantic Treaty being promoted as a means of maintaining peace, could not help but expose the true aggressive meaning of the North Atlantic Treaty. The newspaper's editorial on May 17, 1949, said: A peace built by turning the Western world into an armed camp will be an extraordinary peace....

The aggressive nature of the North Atlantic Treaty (which is a tool for direct and immediate preparation for imperialist war) does not need to be proven in any special way at present. Indeed, it is not accidental that a British Member of Parliament who praised the North Atlantic Treaty as a step towards enhancing peace could not help but shout out: "I want to ask today, when are we going to move from defense to offense!" (Parliamentary Debate Record, Volume 463, pages 460-461) This Member of Parliament accidentally said the truth about the aggressive purpose of the North Atlantic Treaty.

Whether it is the military alliance organized under the leadership of the United States and Britain, or the growing network of air and naval bases, the essence is not to prevent the Soviet Union's offensive threat that does not exist at all (which the instigators of a new war know very well), but to attack. These truths and facts cannot be concealed from the people by cunning pretentiousness. Allocating hundreds of billions of dollars to prepare for a new war constitutes a new burden for the people who are already living in poverty. This is not defense but preparation for offense.

In his budget submitted to Congress, Truman boasted that the armed forces in the 1950 budget were the strongest armed forces maintained by the United States in peacetime, and at the same time, the funding for the development of natural resources alone (including atomic energy) reached almost two billion dollars. But the US President admitted that expenditures in 1950-51 would even exceed the 1950 budget, and the funding for the armed forces may greatly exceed the 1950 level. It is not accidental that in addition to the military expenditures stipulated in the 1950 budget, the US President also proposed that the appropriation for supplying war materials to the participants of the North Atlantic Treaty, the amount of which has not yet been determined, be included. According to reports, this appropriation will total between two and three billion dollars.

These words cannot be said to bring comfort to the American people! In his recent speech at the New York Conference of the American Artillery Association, US Secretary of Defense Johnson stated: "The purpose of American policy is to achieve peace by force." He even talked about the extent of industrial mobilization that the US Army Department has carried out to cope with the war. According to Johnson, 60% of the 1,595 factories established by the United States during the war have been designated as reserve factories for use in emergency situations.

The same absurd boasting can also be seen in a book titled "Global Mission" recently published by General Arnold, former commander of the US Army Air Corps, who naively asserted in that book that the United States relies on the monopoly of atomic bombs to maintain world balance.

As we all know, General Bradley said a few months ago: "Among the twelve countries, we are the only country with atomic bombs. We are the only country qualified to carry out strategic bombing." Later, this statement was interpreted as in the future military operations of the North Atlantic Alliance, the United States is willing to use atomic bombs to deal with "any" aggressor!

The extent to which war hysteria has spread among some people in the United States can be judged by the fact that the United States is hosting special strategic lectures on the war against the Soviet Union. If you want to give an example, we can talk about the lectures to officers of the Air War College at Maxwell Airport.

In the United States, many such "lectures" and such a large amount of literary and artistic writing appear every day. War profiteers spare no effort and scramble to incite war psychology and inject the poison of hatred for the people of other countries and the poison of war ideas into the minds of the people as much as possible.

A saying from the Roman Empire has been revived and is popular among the reactionary groups in the United States, Britain, and other countries in their camp. This saying is: "To want peace, you must prepare for war!" The real purpose of this saying is to use empty talk of peace to cover up war preparations.

War profiteers are in a hurry. They know that time is not in their favor, and the forces of peace and democracy are growing faster than the dark forces of reaction and aggression. In a recent article in the Army Intelligence Digest published in September, US Secretary of Defense Johnson urged immediate action and openly stated: "We cannot wait until the complete recovery of European industrial output. If we wait, then we will once again run the risk of being too little and too late."

Under this atmosphere, the smooth work of the United Nations is impossible. Everyone who is truly committed to international cooperation and strengthening peace must end this situation and must not allow lunatics and semi-lunatics to play with fire. This situation must end.

The first point of the Soviet proposal—condemning new war preparations—is directly aimed at this goal. The passage of this proposal marks a major step forward in the struggle against new war and in the struggle to strengthen peace.

　　　　Prohibit Atomic Weapons and Establish Strict International Control

Mr. Acheson on September 21 and Mr. Bevin on September 26 both spoke about the issue of banning atomic weapons. The positions of the United States and Great Britain in the Special Committee's discussions on atomic issues are very clear. The United States and Great Britain continue to adhere to their original positions, insisting on the American so-called international control plan—the Baruch, Acheson, and Lilienthal plan. It is now very clear: Who is creating the deadlock on this issue? Who is unwilling to conclude a treaty banning atomic bombs, so that they can do whatever they want in this regard?

The delay in discussing the issue of banning atomic weapons is undoubtedly part of the US plan of action. This can also be seen from the statement made by Lilienthal, chairman of the US Atomic Energy Commission, on July 6 this year. This statement said: In 1946, the United States was virtually unarmed in terms of atomic weapons. Because of this situation, the US Atomic Energy Commission needed to use all its strength to produce atomic bombs, so that it could reach a quantity and quality that would serve as a "warning" to aggressors.

In order to make the meaning of Lilienthal's words absolutely clear, it must be said that, according to Lilienthal's admission, the commission's full attention has been completely focused on the production of atomic bombs since then, as it is now. The report submitted by the US Atomic Energy Commission to Congress on January 31, 1949, pointed out: The production and improvement of atomic weapons remains the work of the Atomic Energy Commission, and this work has received the greatest attention. Significant progress was made in this area in 1948. The production of explosive materials has expanded. New types of weapons have been successfully tested, and further improvements are currently being implemented. (New York Times, February 1, 1949)

Therefore, while conducting diplomatic negotiations on banning atomic weapons and expressing so-called "goodwill" in this regard to win people's hearts, the secret commission is drawing up various measures to ensure that the United States accumulates the largest amount of atomic bombs in the shortest period of time! It is understandable that under this situation (this situation promotes the US's above-mentioned policy direction on atomic issues, that is, the policy of accumulating atomic bombs), it is impossible to have serious hope for reaching an agreement with the United States on the issue of banning atomic bombs and then stopping the production of atomic bombs. When Mr. Acheson and Mr. Bevin announced that there was no hope of finding a basis for an agreement until the Soviet Union accepted the American plan, isn't the inconsistent attitude of the United States, and of course Britain, on this issue explained by this? The US President also essentially confirmed this, saying that the US plan is the best plan. Therefore, at the beginning of this session, the US government slammed the door shut, unwilling to try to reach an agreement on the issue of banning atomic weapons and establishing supervision to implement this ban.

Bevin, who followed Acheson, also put forward the same policy, but he put it forward in a more non-diplomatic way. But even so, Bevin had to blatantly distort the facts. As is well known, British diplomats never hesitate to use such means, especially when the issue concerns the Soviet Union. We all remember how Bevin praised the US plan to control atomic energy to the skies. He insisted that the US plan guaranteed the effective prohibition of atomic weapons. Naturally, he was completely unconcerned that the foundation of the American plan lay in the elimination of national sovereignty. This plan would completely eliminate national sovereignty. This plan meant that the national economy and the entire economic and cultural development of the country would be completely subordinate to the so-called international control organization.

Because we have paid enough attention to the atomic issue in the Special Committee, I will not say more about this issue. I will only say a few words about Pearson's remarks on national sovereignty. In the Special Committee, Pearson said that the Soviet Union's claim that the American plan eliminates national sovereignty is absurd. According to Pearson, on the contrary, the American plan is a step forward. He said: This is not a loss of sovereignty, but a use of sovereignty. But no matter how you evaluate this American plan from the point of view of sovereignty, one thing is undoubted, that is, the American plan certainly means the abandonment of sovereignty. However, this does not hinder Pearson at all, because according to him, national sovereignty is a harmful "reactionary concept" that must be put in the "antique shop" as soon as possible. Mr. Pearson's speech made American monopoly capitalists overjoyed. He easily eliminated the national independence and sovereignty of some other countries that hinder the United States from ruling other countries and the entire world. The joint offensive of the US and British camp against national sovereignty is by no means motivated by the noble "humanitarian" motives of loving peace and loving mankind. The true motive of this offensive is to clear the way for US imperialism and remove the last few obstacles on its path to establishing world hegemony. The US-British group's crusade against the national sovereignty of other countries is directly related to that kind of North Atlantic Treaty or "Marshall Plan." This kind of treaty or plan aims to ensure that these countries are unconditionally placed under US influence. The United States announced that it has taken on the full responsibility for the fate of the world from now on. From such a large appetite, where can we talk about respecting the sovereignty of any country! As one scientist pointed out, under these conditions, talking about national sovereignty is tantamount to going south by driving the chariot north. The "Marshall Plan" and national sovereignty are completely incompatible. No wonder even some British conservatives have had to admit that the smooth implementation of the "Marshall Plan" will mean turning the British Empire into a part of the European Federation, just like Virginia's current relationship with the United States of America. Judging from many signs, Canada intends to become a state of the United States in the near future. The sovereignty of this country has been vociferously abandoned by Pearson a few days ago... That's all about the issue of sovereignty for now.

The defenders of the American so-called international control plan are trying to portray it as proof that the US government is willing to abandon its so-called advantage in atomic energy, and as some kind of sacrifice on the part of the United States. This statement is particularly unfounded under the current circumstances. There is no longer any talk of the US's advantage in the field of atomic energy in the field of atomic energy. Therefore, the United Nations is still facing the task of seeking a solution to the practical problem of banning atomic weapons and establishing true international control. The General Assembly must fulfill its duties and acknowledge that further delays in taking practical measures to resolve the above tasks are unacceptable.

The French and Canadian proposals currently under consideration by the Special Committee cannot guarantee the solution of this problem. We need not only hope or declarations, but also practical and serious measures.

It is precisely the adoption of practical measures that is required in the second point of the Soviet proposal. In its proposal, the Soviet government pointed out that civilized countries have long condemned the use of poison gas and bacteria for war purposes as a great crime against humanity. The Soviet government proposed that the General Assembly take the same action on the use of atomic weapons as civilized countries have taken on the use of poison gas and bacteria for war purposes. But, no matter how unexpected, at the beginning of this session, opposition was encountered when the prohibition of the use of bacteria and poison gas was just mentioned. This opposition mainly came from British Foreign Secretary Bevin.

Bevin pointed out that the reason why poison gas was not used in the Second World War was not because of any charter, but only because the aggressors feared that the joint forces of Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States might take retaliatory measures. The consideration of fearing retaliatory measures in wartime will exist at any time, but it must be made clear that if you really want to conclude such a convention, such considerations must not be used as an argument against banning atomic bombs. On the contrary, those who do not want to conclude such a convention can always invent all kinds of objections, just to evade suggestions that are inconvenient to them. We must not consider this idea.

Atomic weapons are weapons of aggression. The use of atomic weapons violates the dignity and conscience of the people. Since banning atomic weapons is conducive to peace and international security, the ban is necessary. The second point of the Soviet proposal on this issue emphasizes that members of the United Nations must not use atomic weapons or other weapons of mass destruction of the people. Delaying a decision on this issue is not in line with the dignity of the United Nations, nor is it allowed by the United Nations. It has been almost four years since the issue of banning atomic weapons was raised in the United Nations.

It has also been more than three years since the United Nations unanimously acknowledged in principle that the use of atomic energy for war purposes is inadmissible, and agreed to establish international control to supervise the use of atomic energy so that it is used entirely for peaceful purposes. But so far, there has been no progress. The Soviet government demands that the General Assembly recognize that it is inadmissible for the United Nations to further delay taking practical steps to unconditionally ban atomic weapons and establish appropriate and strict international control.

　　　　Conclusion of a Five-Power Pact to Strengthen Peace

The proposal submitted by the Soviet delegation to the General Assembly on September 23 this year requested the General Assembly to express the hope that the five major powers, the United States, Britain, China, France, and the Soviet Union, which bear the main responsibility for maintaining peace and international security, would make joint efforts for this purpose and conclude mutual conventions to strengthen peace. This proposal is a natural result of the diplomatic policy consistently pursued by the Soviet government for 32 years since its establishment.

As is well known, the Soviet policy is a policy of peace. The Soviet Union advocates peace and has always defended the cause of peace with the greatest determination, opposing all attempts to undermine peace and launch wars internationally. The Soviet peace policy that has been pursued over the years arises from the various characteristics of the Soviet socialist country and the Soviet socialist social order. This policy serves the interests of the Soviet people—the builders of a new socialist society—as well as the interests of all peace-loving countries and the interests of all mankind. The Soviet peace policy determines that the measures taken by the Soviet government in international relations should be conducive to cooperation among all countries willing to cooperate, to strengthening international peaceful relations, and to ensuring the security of all countries.

Everyone knows that the Soviet Union participated in the League of Nations in 1934 out of the idea that, as Stalin, the leader of the Soviet government, said: "Although the League of Nations is weak, it can still be used as a platform to expose aggressors and as a tool for peace, although weak, that can still hinder the spread of war." We are now also fully aware of the difficulties involved in the current struggle to defend peace, especially in the atmosphere of various military alliances being launched in some countries, mainly the United States and Britain, and in the atmosphere of the formation and development of military groups such as the North Atlantic or the so-called Western Europe. The Soviet Union has encountered various difficulties in the struggle to defend peace in the past. Stalin, the leader of the Soviet people, pointed out when talking about the situation in 1934 that even in such a difficult period at that time, the Soviet Union also implemented its diplomatic policy of defending the cause of peace.

We might as well recall the period shortly before the start of the Second World War. At that time, as Stalin pointed out, the war destroyed the foundation of the post-war peace system, overturned the basic concepts of international law, and as a result, people questioned the value of international treaties and international obligations. Stalin said that appeasement and disarmament plans had been buried, and replaced by a frenzy of expanding armaments. All countries, big and small, expanded their armaments, especially those countries that pursued a policy of non-interference. Even in this case, the Soviet Union remained unswervingly committed to its policy of maintaining peace and signed a number of mutual assistance treaties to prevent possible attacks by aggressors (with France in 1935, with Czechoslovakia in the same year, with the Mongolian People' Republic in 1936; and with China in 1937). We all remember that it was precisely at that time that the relations between capitalist countries and the relations within these countries were seriously deteriorating, and it was precisely at that time that the trend of disarmament in the previous years gave way to the trend of armament and arms expansion. When referring to this period, Stalin, the leader of the Soviet people, said: Amidst the stormy waves of this economic upheaval and military-political catastrophe, the Soviet Union stood firm, continuing its socialist construction and the struggle to maintain peace.

The Soviet government's efforts aimed at defending peace were not unsuccessful. As a result of these efforts, the Soviet Union signed treaties of non-aggression and treaties for the peaceful settlement of disputes with a number of countries. In implementing its peace policy, the Soviet Union relied not only on its internal strength, but also on the common feelings of those countries that, for one reason or another, did not want to violate peace. In March 1939, when talking about the relations between the Soviet Union and capitalist countries, Stalin pointed out: "We maintain peace and advocate strengthening our commercial relations with all countries in the world, as long as these countries maintain the same relationship with the Soviet Union and do not attempt to infringe upon our interests, we will always maintain this position." The Soviet government's foreign policy program fully conforms to the great task of strengthening peace and international security.

After the victorious conclusion of the Second World War, the Soviet Union signed a number of international agreements of great historical importance. The Tehran, Yalta, and Potsdam agreements determined the

    维辛斯基关于谴责新战争准备与五强缔结加强和平公约演说全文
    【新华社北京十七日电】塔斯社纽约十五日讯，苏联出席联合国大会代表团团长维辛斯基十一月十四日在联合国大会政治委员会上，对苏联所提谴责新战争准备与五强缔结加强和平公约的建议案发表演说，全文如下：
    九月二十三日，苏联代表团奉苏联政府之命令，向大会提出了关于谴责新战争准备与五强缔结加强和平公约的建议。
    简单地说，这些建议是这样的：（一）谴责某些国家、特别是美国和英国所进行着的新战争准备。（二）承认使用原子武器及其他大规模毁灭人类的手段是违背各国人民的良知和荣誉，并与联合国会员国的资格不相容的。不容许联合国再事拖延而不采取无条件禁止原子武器，并建立适当的严格的国际管制的实际措施。（三）表示由五强——美、英、中、法、苏共同努力，以避免新战争的威胁，并由它们缔结加强和平公约的愿望。
    　　　　苏联一贯保卫和平事业
    这些建议是苏联政府自苏维埃国家成立以来，就始终如一地遵守着的外交政策的自然结果。苏维埃国家的第一个行动就是宣布一九一七年十一月关于公正民主的和平这个历史性的法令，这是存在了三十二年的苏联从它存在的第一天起就在遵循着的原则方针的表现。苏联在联合国里向来维护并且现在还在维护这种方针。应当记得，苏联政府在一九四六年联合国第一届大会中（一九四六年），就曾提出实行普遍裁减军备与军队的建议。这个建议成为大会一九四六年十二月十四日历史性决议的基础。苏联政府用这个建议表示了对普遍和平的坚决意志并愿意从事国家的社会经济事务与社会制度的和平竞争。在一九四七年联合国第二届大会上，苏联政府担负了首先谴责任何形式的新战争宣传的崇高的任务。在一九四八年在巴黎举行的联合国第三届大会上，苏联进一步为了增进和平与国际合作的事业，向五个主要国家建议裁减军队与军备三分之一，禁止原子武器，并在安理会之内建立一个国际管制机构，监督与管制上述措施的实施。但是这个建议遭到大会中驯服地跟随着反对苏联爱好和平的建议的美国和英国的多数所否决。必须指出，苏联代表在安理会中所提出的类似的提案也遭到同样的命运。联合国中的美英一贯系统地拒绝以前所提出的反对新战争准备与巩固和平的一切建议！
    苏联现在所提出的建议，是苏联始终不变地遵循着的原则方针的继续。这个方针就是保卫和平与国际合作，反对极少数的一些冒险家与世界霸权的追求者正在准备着的新战争的威胁。苏联提出消除新战争威胁与加强和平的建议，再次向全世界大声疾呼，反对以美国和英国为首的侵略集团所正在准备着的新屠杀，对于苏联的建议，谴责新战争准备，禁止原子武器，建立严格的国际管制的建议，五国缔结加强和平公约的建议，难道有谁能反对吗？除了和平与国际合作的敌人之外，除了那些以新战争准备和新战争为他们发财致富的来源的人之外，除了那些以新战争来建立世界霸权和奴役其他国家的人以外，谁也不能反对苏联的建议！
    　　　　战争贩子企图阻挠苏联建议
    毫无疑问，反对这种建议的，只有那种怙恶不悛的和平反对者，以准备战争为业的反动集团的代表，他们把战争看成发财的来源。美国反动集团代表之一哈佛大学的教授桑姆纳·斯利赫特公开承认这一点。他在一个金融界与工商界的代表会议上无耻地说：对苏“冷战”是一件“好事情”。“冷战”可以增加对货物的需求，帮助维持高水平的就业，加迅技术的进步，从而帮助国家提高生活水平。斯利赫特还说：“要是没有了‘冷战’，政府对货物的需求就会比目前少上几十亿元，而工业界与政府用在技术研究上的开支，也会比目前少上几十亿元。因此，我们非常感谢苏联，他们使美国的资本主义进行得空前良好。”
    这个哈佛大学狂妄的无知之徒所说的这些无耻的话，要不是他暴露了战争贩子的破坏活动的真正动机，本来是值不得去谈的。可是不幸，这种事实还并不是孤立的。人们在美国和其他某些国家仍然感觉得到这些国家中的反动集团的挑拨勾当，正在煽动战争气氛。真的，人们在这个阵营里可以听得到对苏联爱好和平的建议的狂吠和敌视的诋毁。在本届大会上，国民党代表团、铁托集团代表团和其他受美国和英国代表团指挥的一些代表团的反苏力量的联合诽谤攻击。在这里用歪曲和恶毒的捏造之词来反对苏联，难道这些我们还没有亲眼看见吗？无庸怀疑，这个阵营今后仍然会有人出来反对苏联建议，捏造各种各样的遁辞，提出形形色色的建议，借以挫败苏联的建议。这些建议揭露了新战争挑拨者的见不得人的计划。美英集团的领袖在本届大会开始时就已经发出了攻击苏联建议的信号。
    贝文九月二十六日在大会上的演说，主要的意思正是在这里。他那天一开头就谈到苏联和苏联在九月二十三日提出的建议。贝文不失他自己的本色，企图把苏联这些建议和苏联整个的外交政策说成是对在联合国中建立合作的“严重打击”。苏联过去和现在都是始终如一地为加强联合国（这是作为和平的重要工具）的影响和作用而奋斗，为真诚一贯的国际合作的利益正确地遵守联合国宪章而奋斗，这一点在整个苏联外交政策、许多文件和一九四六年第一届大会开始以来苏联代表团在联合国中屡次的发言中，可以得到证明。而贝文对苏联的外交政策，竟然作这样的歪曲。
    贝文攻击苏联的外交政策，竭力想为北大西洋公约、布鲁塞尔公约、分裂德国、军备竞赛和新战争准备这些反动的敌视和平事业的措施辩解，企图把这一切归咎于苏联和苏联的外交政策。他那次演说中还特别谈到德国问题，虽然这个问题与联合国毫不相干，而贝文却企图把他所说的所谓柏林危机的责任推在苏联身上。因此，他要诋毁苏联政府关于谴责新战争准备与缔结加强和平的五强公约的建议。假如我们要谈到“柏林危机”的话，难道还有人不知道这完全是美国和英国政府制造出来的吗？就是它们为了想把它们分裂德国的政策掩盖起来，因而制造了所谓“柏林危机”。就是它们企图在这个问题上制造新的纠纷，人为地挑拨铁路工人罢工，以便用警察的挑衅来煽动德国工人反对柏林苏联军政府。就是它们阻挠在巴黎解决柏林问题，阻挠六个所谓中立国代表与苏联代表之间及早获致协议。雅尔达与波茨坦协定的破坏者，现在已因建立一个分立的傀儡西德即所谓波恩政府，而使拒绝履行根据上述协定所承担的国际义务的行动登峰造极。它们凭借可鄙的谎言和诽谤，硬说苏联政府宁愿冒战争的危险，而不肯放弃其管制柏林的目的，正如贝文在九月二十六日所说的那样。
    这一切的捏造都是贝文所需要的，以便事前毒化政治的气氛，并转移人们对苏联提议的注意，以便破坏对于有利于加强和平和国际合作这一提议的信任，而加强和平和国际合作正是苏联政府所努力企求的目标。
    美英集团的代表后来的若干发言都表明，贝文的信号已被接受。例如，加拿大代表不但没有严肃认识苏联加强和平的建议的重要性，反而沉溺于反苏的诽谤与捏造什么“战后时期的新帝国主义”，沉溺于无稽的捏造什么苏联在其邻国建立“统治”。加拿大的代表当然知道，他所说的关于苏联和人民民主国家的话没有一句是真的。但是，对他说来，什么是真理呢？对他说来，制造风波才是重要的。
    加拿大代表对苏联建议之实质所说的话证明：问题的关键对于他是不感兴趣的。所以他把这些建议说成纯粹的宣传，以便推开苏联的建议。这是滥调，而且是完全不能令人信服的。苏联的建议并不是宣传，因为美国、英国及其同伙之进行疯狂的军备竞赛，确是事实，军事预算在增大，人民福利进一步遭受侵害，他们的负担日益沉重，这些也是事实。美国和英国不间断地准备新的战争，这表现在美国建立许许多多陆海空军基地上，表现在组织那些追求侵略目的、反对爱好和平国家的军事集团上，——所有这一切都不是宣传，而是事实。
    这是一种事实，而不是一种宣传——在美国，就在我们的眼前，就展开着一项无耻的讨论，这就是美国空军代表们与美国海军代表们之间所进行的关于进攻爱好和平国家的最好方法的讨论，关于消灭亿万人民、毁灭和平城市和整个国家的最好方法的讨论，而且这种讨论甚至在最为反动的侵略国家历史中，也是找不出的。
    加拿大外长皮尔逊一流人，竟把揭发那一小撮准备对人类作出新的最严重罪行的帝国主义者们所做的这种野蛮无耻的“工作”，形容为一种“宣传”。但问题不是宣传，而是在于联合所有诚实人民的一切努力，阻止世界霸权的追求者的新罪行，攫住战争贩子们按在各爱好和平国家头上的罪恶的手！但倘若我们要说到宣传，那就应该注意到美国国防部长詹逊于一九四九年八月在美国参院讨论军事援助方案的委员会上所发表的那种声明。他说：“在西欧，军事的真空已成为对国际共产主义的巨大引诱。”要说这不是反苏的战争宣传，要说这不是对于这种战争的直接煽动，那还会是什么呢？
    由此可见，加拿大代表尤其不喜欢苏联提案第三项中所提到的一点，即所有国家中争取和平与反对战争贩子的强有力的人民运动。皮尔逊说：这在共产党字汇中有特定的含义。但皮尔逊及其随从们应当知道，“和平”二字在所有的字汇中，都是意味着和平，而且这两个字已成为世界各地亿万人民的旗帜，成为指路的北极星，它指导着那些具有充分决心阻止新的血腥屠杀的人们，指导着那些具有充分决心阻止那种有使千万城市化为瓦砾、亿万人民化为枯骨之危险的疯狂的新战争的人们！全世界人民都不要战争，他们要求和平！而且这个日益增长的和平要求，是来自一切号召拯救与造福人类的国家！这是一个正在上升的太阳，所有的反动分子和蒙昧主义分子，在这种光明辉耀与仁慈的阳光下，都销声匿迹了！激怒皮尔逊这一伙人的，就是这个争取和平的人民运动，这一伙人在人民的和平愿望中，看到他们自己侵略计划的破产。这里的铁托集团代表同情地附和加拿大代表，也企图把苏联的提案说成一种宣传，并利用这些提案的讨论，作为对苏联进行新诽谤的借口。
    这些例证足以十分明确地表明：苏联政府的高尚的提案，已在筹划新战争计划的阵营中引起了混乱，这个阵营将采取措施，以图挫败苏联政府于九月二十三日在本届会议中所提出的建议。这是一个和平方案，它符合苏联人民和国家的利益，而对于实行扩张和殖民征服者，则毫不相干。这个和平方案符合全体进步人类和一切爱好和平人民的利益。这就是为什么新战争挑拨者们对这个方案进行攻击的原因。这个方案如告实现，就将意味着军事冒险政策的失败。这个军事冒险政策已使某些国家尤其美国及英国的统治集团大露头角了。
    　　　　谴责新战争准备
    苏联代表提议谴责在某些国家尤其美国及英国所进行的新战争准备。
    在纽约举行的联合国第二届大会，曾一致通过决议、谴责在任何形式下的新战争宣传，我们还记得，当时美国代表奥斯汀曾公开地说苏联所提关于谴责战争宣传的草案，应当在事先予以挫败。美国代表团没有能这样做，没有能阻止关于谴责战争宣传的决议的通过。然而必须承认，在此以后的两年中，在实际上破坏这个决议并使其失去任何真实意义一事上，没有任何人能赶上美国的反动集团。不仅如此。在这几个年头中，在若干国家尤其在美国及英国国内，战争宣传不仅没有衰退，反而增长到一种更加疯狂与歇斯底里的程度。（原文脱漏一小段——编者）
    与此同时，民主力量方面对这种宣传的反对正在继续增长，民主力量拥有数以万万计的和平拥护者，他们越来越有力地宣言反对新战争的宣传。一九四九年四月，在巴黎及布拉格举行的世界拥护和平大会，出席的有五百六十一个争取和平的全国性组织，十二个参加和平运动的国际组织，代表了六亿有组织的和平拥护者。尽管大会组织者们遭遇到一切阻碍，有如巴黎拥护和平大会的工作遭遇到法国当局的反对，大会却达到了上述目的。不仅在一国范围内，而且在国际范围内，亿万人民已联合起来，确立了他们的任务，这就是阻止新屠杀、阻止侵略者实现对和平与国际和平合作的罪恶阴谋。这个强有力的争取和平的人民运动，是战争失败与和平胜利的可靠保证！马林科夫在纪念伟大十月革命三十二周年纪念日所发表的演说中说：“声势浩大的和平运动证明，人民已成为能够遏制侵略者的一种力量。”而在更大的程度上激怒了和平的敌人与新战争挑拨者们的，正是争取和平的人民运动的成就。
    但是事实却仍然是事实！新战争宣传并没有停止，并且一直到现在都受到某些政府，特别是美国和英国政府的支持和鼓励。而它们仍然还是不停的唱着“和平”与“国际合作”的高调来掩盖自己。
    现在的问题还不仅仅是战争宣传。问题在于因准备战争而已经采取实际的措施，拟订军事战略计划。这些措施说明了战争的威胁已经超过了口头上说说的阶段，而进入了实际行动，物质和组织措施的阶段。在这个问题上，象成立北大西洋联盟（主持这个联盟的人竭力用防御、和平与安全等捏造的话来掩盖它的侵略性质）这类的措施被指定要起重要的作用。但是“防御”、“和平”、“安全”这些话的虚伪，只要以它一方面反对爱好和平的国家同时又包括有一些不在北大西洋地区内的国家在里面这件事实，就可以揭露了。这充分泄露了北大西洋联盟的侵略计划。这个联盟是代表一个顽固死硬的国家集团，而且特别重要的是完全不顾德国侵略再起的可能性。苏联与人民民主国家真正防御性质的条约，就是防范德国侵略的再起。值得注意的是参加反希特勒联盟的大国之中，只有苏联一个国家没有参加这个北大西洋条约。北大西洋公约的目的是反苏的，它是一个侵略条约，只要看苏联没有参加这一事实就没有再怀疑的余地了，不管这个条约的参加者和组织者捏造什么词句来作烟幕！
    艾奇逊和贝文两位先生在大会发表的演说，企图证明北大西洋公约和布鲁塞尔公约是增进和平与国际合作，并不追求任何侵略目的的。但甚至象华尔街日报这样的报纸在谈到北大西洋公约被宣扬为维护和平的手段时，也不能不暴露北大西洋公约的真正侵略意义。该报一九四九年五月十七日的社论说：用将西方世界变为武装阵营的方法而建立起来的和平，将是一种出奇的和平……。
    北大西洋公约（它是直接和立即准备帝国主义战争的工具）的侵略性质，目前并不需要加以任何特别的证明。的确，这并不是偶然的，一位极力赞扬北大西洋公约为走向增强和平的一个步骤的英国议员，也不能不喊出：“我今天要问一问，我们打算在什么时候由防御过渡到进攻呢！”（国会辩论记录第四六三卷四六○至四六一页）这位议员偶然地说出了关于北大西洋公约的侵略目的的真意。
    不论是在美英领导下组织起来的军事同盟，或者是越来越多的空海军基地网，其实质都并不是用来防范根本就不存在的苏联的进攻威胁（这一点是新战争挑拨者们很清楚的），而是用来进攻的，这些真象和事实都不是用狡猾的装腔作势所能从人民面前掩饰得了的。拨出数百亿美元准备新战争，构成了业已生活在贫困中的人民的新的负担，这不是防御而是进攻的准备。
    杜鲁门在他向议会提出的预算中曾夸口说，在一九五○年预算中的武装部队是美国在和平时期所保持的最强有力的武装部队，同时单单开发天然资源（包括原子能在内）的经费，就达到几乎二十亿美元。但美国总统承认一九五○——五一年的开支甚或还将超过一九五○年的预算，而武装部队的经费也可能大大超过一九五○年的水平。美国除了在一九五○年预算中所规定的军事开支之外，它的总统还建议须包括数目尚未确定的供应北大西洋公约参加者以战争物资的拨款，这一点并不是偶然的。据报载，这笔拨款总计将达二十亿到三十亿美元之多。
    这种话是不能够说带给美国人民以安慰的！美国国防部长詹逊最近在纽约美国炮兵协会会议上发表的演说中称：“美国政策的目的，是以武力取得和平”。他甚至大谈美国陆军部已经为应付战争而进行的工业动员的程度。据詹逊说：美国在战争时期建立起来的一千五百九十五个工厂中的百分之六十，已经被指定为后备工厂，以备在紧急情况时使用。
    在美国前陆军航空总队司令安诺德将军最近出版的一本题名“世界使命”的书里，也能看到同样的荒谬的夸口，他在那本书里天真地断言：美国靠原子弹垄断来保持世界均势。
    众所周知，几个月以前布莱德雷将军说过：“在十二个国家中，我们是唯一有原子弹的国家。我们是唯一有资格实行战略轰炸的国家。”后来这个声明被解释为在将来的北大西洋联盟的军事行动中，美国愿意用原子弹来对付“任何”侵略者！
    战争歇斯底里在美国某些人士中间蔓延的程度，可以用在美国举办关于对苏战争的特别战略的演讲这件事来加以判断。如果要举例的话，我们可以谈一谈在马克斯威尔飞机场向空中战争学院军官的讲演。
    在美国每天都出现许多这类“讲演”和这类大量的舞文弄墨。战争贩子们不遗余力地、争先恐后地煽动战争心理，尽可能多地对人民的脑子里灌注仇恨别国人民的毒素和战争思想的毒素。
    罗马帝国时代的一句格言又复活了，并且正在美英和它们阵营的其他国家的反动集团中间流行，这句格言是：“说要和平，就必须准备战争！”这句格言的真正目的是用空谈和平来掩饰战争准备。
    战争贩子很着急，他们知道时间是不利于他们的，和平与民主的力量比反动及侵略黑暗力量增长得快。美国国防部长詹逊最近在九月份出版的陆军情报文摘中的一篇文章里，敦促立即行动，并公然地声称：“我们不能够等到欧洲工业产量的完全恢复。如果我们等待，那我们就要再一次冒太少与太迟的危险。”
    在这种气氛底下，联合国的顺利工作是根本谈不上的。每一个真正致力于国际合作与加强和平的人，都必须结束这种情势，必须不允许疯狂者与半疯狂者玩火。这种情势必须结束。
    苏联提案中的第一点建议——谴责新战争准备，就是直接针对着这一目的。这一建议的通过标志着在反对新战争的斗争中，及在加强和平的斗争中前进了一大步。
    　　　　禁止原子武器，建立严格的国际管制
    艾奇逊先生于九月二十一日，贝文先生于九月二十六日都曾谈到禁止原子武器的问题。美国与英国在特别委员会讨论原子问题时的立场是十分清楚的。美国与英国继续坚持其原来的立场，坚持美国的所谓国际管制计划——巴鲁区、艾奇逊与李连塞尔的计划。现在已经很清楚：究竟是谁在这个问题上造成僵局？是谁不愿意缔结禁止原子弹的协约，以便能在这方面为所欲为。
    对禁用原子武器问题讨论的拖延，不成问题是美国行动计划的一部分。这也可以从美国原子能委员会主席李连塞尔在今年七月六日所发表的声明中看出来。这个声明说：一九四六年美国在原子武器方面实际上是毫无武装的。由于这种情形，美国原子能委员会就需要以全部力量用来生产原子弹，使它达到能对侵略者成为一种“警告”的数量和质量。
    为了把李连塞尔这种话的意义解释得绝对的明确起见，必须要说，根据李连塞尔所承认的，该委员会的全部注意力，自那时以来就和现在一样，完全集中在原子弹的生产上。美国原子能委员会一九四九年一月三十一日提交国会的报告指出：原子武器的生产与改善仍然是原子能委员会的工作，这项工作曾受到最大的注意。一九四八年在这一方面曾有重大的进展。爆炸性材料的生产扩大了。新型武器顺利地试验了，进一步的改善目前也在实行。（一九四九年二月一日纽约时报）
    因此，在进行关于禁止原子武器的外交谈判和美国在这方面为笼络人心而表示所谓“好意”的同时，秘密的委员会却在拟订各种措施，用以保证美国在最短期间内积存最大量的原子弹！很可以理解，在这种情形之下（这种情形促进了美国在原子问题上的上述政策方针，即积存原子弹的方针）对于同美国在禁止原子弹并继之以停止原子弹生产的问题上达成协议一事，是不能抱认真的希望的。当艾奇逊与贝文二位先生宣布在苏联未接受美国的计划之前，没有求得协议基础的希望的时候，美国，当然还有英国，对这个问题所抱的不协调的态度，难道不是可以从这里得到解释吗？美国总统实质上也证实了这一点，他说过美国的计划是最好的计划。因此，美国政府在本届会议上一开头就砰然关死了门，不愿在禁止原子武器和建立履行这一禁令的监督的问题上，设法达成协议。
    跟着艾奇逊走的贝文也提出同样的方针，只是他提出的方式是比较非外交的。可是即使如此，贝文还是不得不明目张胆地歪曲事实。如所周知，英国外交人员利用这种手段是从来不犹豫的，特别是在问题关系到苏联的时候。我们大家都记得贝文曾怎样把美国的管制原子能计划捧得天花乱坠。他硬说美国计划保证了有效地禁止原子武器。对于美国计划的基础在于消灭国家主权这一点，他自然完全不关心的。这个计划会把国家主权消灭得干干净净，这个计划意味着使国家的国民经济和整个经济与文化的发展，完全从属于所谓国际管制机构。
    因为我们在特别委员会对于原子问题曾予以足够的注意，这个问题我就不再多说了。我只就皮尔逊关于国家主权的言论说几句话。在特别委员会中，皮尔逊说过苏联断言美国计划消灭国家主权是荒谬的。据皮尔逊说，相反地，美国计划是向前进了一步。他说：这不是主权的丧失，而是对主权的利用。但是无论从主权的观点上对于这个美国计划如何评价，有一件事情是无可怀疑的，即美国的计划确凿意味着主权的放弃。然而这绝不妨碍皮尔逊，因为据他说，国家主权是有害的“反动概念”，必须尽快放到“古董铺”里去。皮尔逊先生的演说使美国独占资本家心花怒放，这点是无可否认的。他轻而易举地就把其他一些国家妨碍美国统治其他国家和整个世界的国家独立与主权取消掉了。美英阵营对国家主权的联合攻势绝非由于爱和平、爱人类的崇高“人道”动机所促成。这个攻势的真正动机是力图给美帝国主义清除道路和除去它建立世界霸权道路上的最后一些障碍。美英集团对其他国家的国家主权的讨伐，是与那类北大西洋公约或“马歇尔计划”有着直接关联的。这种公约或计划旨在保证这些国家无条件地置于美国势力之下。美国宣布它自己从今以后担负了对世界命运的全部责任。从这样大的胃口上看来，哪里还谈得上什么尊重任何国家的主权呢！正如某个科学家所指出的，在这种条件下，谈论国家主权无异于南辕而北辙。“马歇尔计划”与国家主权是绝不相容的。无怪乎连某些英国保守党人都不得不承认，“马歇尔计划”的顺利执行，将意味着使大英帝国变成欧洲联邦的一部分，就象弗吉尼亚现在与美利坚合众国的关系一样。从许多迹象来判断，加拿大打算在最近的将来成为美国的一州，这个国家的主权，在几天之前业已由皮尔逊大声呼号地放弃了，……关于主权问题目前就是这样。
    美国的所谓国际管制计划的辩护者，企图把它说成是美国政府情愿放弃其在原子能方面所谓优势的证明，是美国方面的某种牺牲。这种说法在目前的情况下，特别没有根据。在原子能方面再不允许谈什么美国在原子能领域内的优势了。因此，联合国仍然面对着寻求为实际解决禁止原子武器和成立真正的国际管制问题的办法的任务。联大必须尽其职责，并承认在采取实际措施以解决上述任务之中的进一步拖延，是不能容许的。
    现在特别委员会考虑中的法国和加拿大的提案，不能保证这一问题的解决。我们不仅需要希望或宣言，而且还需要实际的认真的措施。
    苏联提案的第二点中所要求注意的正是采取实际措施。苏联政府在其提案中指出：文明的国家很久以来即谴责为战争目的而使用毒气与细菌是对人类的极大罪行。苏联政府提议联大对于使用原子武器采取同样的行动，一如文明国家对于为战争目的利用毒气和细菌所采取的行动一样。但是，不管多么出人意料，在本届会议开始的时候，在刚刚提到禁止使用细菌和毒气的时候，就遭到了反对，这种反对主要是来自英国外相贝文。
    贝文指出，第二次世界大战中未曾使用毒气，决不是因为有着什么章程，而仅仅是因为侵略者害怕英苏美联合方面可能采取报复措施。在战时害怕报复措施的考虑，是任何时候都会有的，但是必须弄清楚，如果真的希望缔结这样一种公约，这样的考虑就决不能用作反对禁用原子弹的论据。相反，不想缔结这样一种公约的人，总可以发明各式各样的反对，这仅仅是为了规避对于他们不便的建议。我们决不能考虑这种想法。
    原子武器是侵略武器，使用原子武器违反人民的尊严与良知，既然禁用原子武器有利于和平和国际的安全，禁止就是必要的。苏联关于这个问题的提案的第二点，强调联合国的会员不得使用原子武器或其他大规模毁灭人民的武器。在这个问题上迟迟不决，就不合乎联合国的尊严，亦为其所不许。自从禁止原子武器的问题在联合国提出以来，差不多已四年了。
    自从联合国在原则上一致承认把原子能用于战争目的为不可容许，并且赞成设立国际管制，监督原子能的利用，使之完全用于和平的目的，也已过去三年多了。但迄今仍未有任何进展。苏联政府要求联大承认联合国再拖延采取切实步骤以无条件地禁止原子武器是不能容许的，并设立适当的严格的国际管制。
    　　　　缔结五强加强和平公约
    苏联代表团于今年九月二十三日提交大会的建议，曾要求大会表示希望负维持和平与国际安全之主要责任的美、英、中、法、苏五国为上述目的联合努力，并缔结相互的公约，以加强和平。这一建议是苏联政府自成立以来三十二年间一贯推行的外交政策的自然结果。
    如所周知，苏联的政策是和平政策，苏联主张和平，而且一贯以最大决心保卫和平事业，反对一切破坏和平和在国际上发动战争的企图。苏联历年来所推行的和平政策，产生于苏维埃社会主义国家和苏维埃社会主义的社会秩序的各种特点。这个政策服务于苏联人民——新的社会主义的社会的建设者的利益，也服务于一切爱好和平国家的利益与整个人类的利益。苏联的和平政策决定苏联政府在国际关系上采取的措施，要利于一切愿意合作的国家间合作，利于加强国际和平关系及保障各国的安全。
    大家知道，苏联曾于一九三四年参加国际联盟，是出于一种观念，苏联政府领袖斯大林曾说过：“国际联盟虽然软弱，但总还可以作为揭露侵略者的讲台，作为一种虽然软弱、但总还可以阻碍战争蔓延的和平工具。”我们现在也充分认识到：目前保卫和平的斗争中包含着何种的困难，特别是在某些国家、主要是美国和英国，正在发动各种各样的军事联盟的气氛中，在诸如北大西洋或所谓西欧等等的军事集团组成及其发展活动的气氛中。苏联过去在保卫和平的斗争中，也碰到过各种困难。苏维埃人民的领袖斯大林在谈到一九三四年形势时即曾指出过，即令是在当时那样困难的时期中，苏联也执行其保卫和平事业的外交政策。
    我们不妨回忆一下第二次世界大战开始以前不久的时期。那时，如斯大林所指出的，战争破坏了战后和平制度的基础，推翻了国际公法的起码概念，结果便使人对国际条约和国际义务的价值发生了问题。斯大林说，绥靖主义和裁军计划已被埋葬下去，代之而起的是扩大军备的狂热。所有一切大小国家更扩大军备了，其中尤以那些实行不干涉政策的国家为最甚。甚至在这种情况下，苏联仍信守不渝地执行维护和平的政策，签订了若干互助条约以防止侵略者的可能攻击（一九三五年与法国，同年与捷克斯洛伐克，一九三六年与蒙古人民共和国；一九三七年与中国）。我们都记得，那时正是资本主义国家相互间的关系和这些国家国内的关系严重恶化的时候，正是前几年中裁军趋势让位给武装和扩军趋势的时候。苏联人民领袖斯大林在提到这个时期时说：在这种经济大变动和军事政治大灾难的惊涛骇浪中间，苏联屹然不动，继续进行其社会主义建设事业和维护和平的斗争。
    苏联政府旨在保卫和平的努力，并不是不成功的。由于这种努力的结果，苏联与若干国家签订了互不侵犯条约与和平解决争端的条约。苏联在执行其和平政策时，不仅依靠它的内部力量，而且依靠那些由于这种或那种理由而不愿违犯和平的国家的共同感。一九三九年三月，斯大林谈及苏联与资本主义国家间的关系时指出：“我们维护和平，主张加强我国与世界各国之间的商务关系，只要这些国家也对苏联维持同样的关系，而不企图侵犯我国利益的时候，我们是始终保持这个立场的。”苏联政府的外交政策方案完全符合加强和平与国际安全的伟大任务。
    在第二次世界大战胜利结束以后，苏联签订了若干具有巨大历史重要性的国际协定。德黑兰、雅尔塔、波茨坦协定，确定了具有巨大历史意义的解决战后局势的若干最重要的措施。苏联严格和信守不渝地履行它所负的任务，并坚持要求签订协定的其他国家履行义务。为了增进和平，苏联政府曾提出与日本签订和约的问题。
    苏联所提关于普遍节制与裁减军备和武装部队的议案、关于禁止原子武器的议案、关于谴责任何形式的战争宣传的议案、关于裁减五大国武装部队和军备三分之一的议案——苏联在一九四六年至一九四八年间提出的所有的这些议案，都是为了一个目的，就是：加强和平，保证国际安全。苏联代表团在这次联大会议上关于谴责新战争准备及缔结五国加强和平公约的提案，也就是为着这同一目的。
    苏联政府认为维持国际和平与安全的主要责任应该由安理会五常任理事国负担，特建议联合国大会敦促它们共同为这个目的而努力并缔结加强和平的公约。苏联代表团表示深信：这个提案会获得其他代表团应有的支持，苏联代表团确信这些提案的通过将加强和平，并促进联合国负有责任促进的利益。
