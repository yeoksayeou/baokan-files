Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 25th: Comprehensive reports from TASS, Rome: The heroic struggle of landless peasants and hired laborers in Southern Italy to win land is growing in scale and has already won initial victories.

The struggle for land is particularly acute in Sicily, where poor peasants and hired laborers have launched a large-scale movement to independently seize land. On the 13th, about 10,000 poor peasants and hired laborers in the province of Palermo, in response to the unreasonable refusal of the provincial authorities to meet the peasants' demands, occupied more than 4,500 hectares of wasteland. This action forced the landlords and agricultural workers in the area to resume negotiations in Palermo on the 17th. However, during the negotiations, the negotiations broke down again because the landlords refused the demands of the Agricultural Workers' Union. This further aroused the anger of the peasants. Subsequently, the land occupation movement not only spread to the entire province of Palermo, but also to the provinces of Agrigento and Enna. On the 20th, the movement also extended to the province of Catania in Sicily, where peasants occupied more than 6,000 hectares of land in one day.

In southern peninsular Italy, farmers in various parts of the province of Salerno also occupied about 3,000 hectares of landlords' land. The situation is quite tense in the Lazio region, especially in the province of Rome. The local government committee only agreed to provide 150 hectares of land for the peasants to manage, while the peasants demanded 6,200 hectares of land. In the Calabria region, farmers in the province of Cosenza are still persisting in their struggle. The movement to occupy wasteland has also spread to the Latium region.

While peasants in Southern Italy are carrying out the land seizure movement, farm laborers in Northern Italy have also launched a struggle to demand the signing of collective contracts and oppose layoffs. On November 8, a general strike of all agricultural laborers was held in the province of Vicenza. In the province of Brescia, the struggle was particularly fierce because the landlords announced that they would lay off 16,000 agricultural workers from November 11. In addition, the labor movements in the three provinces of Milan, Parma, and Ferrara are also flourishing, and sharecroppers have also joined the strike movement.

The scale of the peasant movement is so broad because rural working people hope to accelerate the implementation of the land reform and the signing of agricultural labor contracts that the Gasperi government had promised long ago. The Steering Committee of the Agricultural Workers' Union, affiliated with the Italian General Confederation of Labor, held a meeting on the 12th to discuss how to coordinate various peasant movements in the struggle to realize the peasants' demand for land reform.

The heroic struggle of the agricultural workers has won initial victories, forcing the Gasperi government to make certain concessions and take preliminary measures to restrain the unrestricted land monopoly of the large feudal landlords in Southern Italy. The Gasperi government has been forced to decide to submit a bill to parliament to hand over 45,000 hectares of landlords' wasteland to the peasants of the Calabria region for management.

The Italian Communist Party's newspaper, Unità, commented on the matter, saying: The government's adoption of these concessions is the result of the large-scale land occupation movement launched by peasants in some provinces of Southern Italy. It was won by the poor peasants and hired laborers with their own blood, through resolute and just struggles. Those who till the land fight for their bread and the right to work, and therefore they are fighting for a new Italy. Their selfless efforts have not been in vain. The newspaper continued: However, the struggle is far from complete, and the struggle is continuing. Now is the time to strive for the immediate realization, fair utilization, and expansion of the decree won from the government.

Senator Bosi, General Secretary of the Agricultural Workers' Union affiliated with the Italian General Confederation of Labor, declared at a press conference: The struggle of the working masses in Southern Italy has forced the government to take measures that are too late and insufficient. However, this is still considered the first step in land reform. When talking about the content of the government's decision, he emphasized that the area of land to be distributed accounts for only a small portion of the total area of wasteland or underutilized land in the country, and does not even amount to one-fifth of the area of the large estates in the Calabria region. Bosi read out the resolution of the Steering Committee of the Agricultural Workers' Union on the government's decision at the press conference. The resolution expressed gratitude to the Italian democratic forces, especially the Italian working class, for their help to the peasant movement in the south.

　　贫雇农自行占地要求土地改革
  　意农民运动规模壮阔
    加斯贝利政府被迫向农民让步
    【新华社北京二十五日电】综合塔斯社罗马消息：南意无地农民与雇农争取土地的英勇斗争，其规模正日益壮大，并已赢得初步胜利。
    争取土地的斗争在西西里岛特别尖锐，该岛贫农与雇农已掀起了大规模自行占地的运动。十三日，巴勒摩省约一万贫农与雇农，为了回答省当局无理拒绝农民的要求，占领了四千五百多顷荒地。这一行动曾迫使该地的地主与农业工人方面，于十七日在巴勒摩恢复谈判。但是，在谈判过程中，由于地主拒绝了农业工人联合会的要求，谈判又告破裂。这就更加激起了农民的愤怒。其后，占地的运动不仅扩及巴勒摩全省，而且也扩及到阿格里真吐省与安那省。二十日，这一运动又延及西西里岛的喀大尼亚省，该地农民一天功夫便占领了六千多公顷土地。
    在意大利半岛南部，萨勒诺省各地的农民，也占领了约三千公顷地主的土地。在拉齐奥区，形势相当紧张，特别是在罗马省。该地政府委员会只答应拿出一百五十公顷土地给农民处理，而农民要求的是六千二百公顷土地。在加拉勃利亚区，科森萨省的农民仍在坚持斗争中。占领荒地的运动亦扩及拉提乌姆区。
    与南意农民开展占地运动的同时，北意农场雇工亦展开了要求订立集体合同与反对解雇的斗争。十一月八日，比森萨省举行了全体农业劳动者的总罢工。在布里西亚省，由于地主宣布自十一月十一日起解雇一万六千名农业工人，斗争特别剧烈。此外，米兰、巴米亚及斐拉拉三省的雇工运动，亦蓬勃开展，伙种者也参加了罢工运动。
    农民运动的规模如此广泛，是由于农村劳动人民希望加速实施加斯贝利政府早已答应的土地改革与订立农业劳动合同。意大利总工会所属农业工人联合会指导委员会，曾于十二日举行会议，讨论在争取实现农民土地改革的要求中，各种农民运动如何配合的问题。
    农业工人的英勇斗争，已赢得初步胜利，它们迫使加斯贝利政府作了某些让步，采取了初步约制南意大封建地主的无限制的土地独占。加期贝利政府已被迫决定向议会提出法案，把四万五千公顷地主的荒地交给加拉勃利亚区农民支配。
    意共机关报团结报评论此事称：政府采取这些让步，是南意一些省份中农民展开大规模占地运动的结果，这是贫农与雇农以自己的鲜血，以坚决而正义的斗争所赢得的。土地耕种者为自己的面包和工作权利而战，就是为新意大利而战。他们的无我的努力，没有白费。该报继称：但是，斗争离完成尚远，斗争正继续着，现在是为争取立即实现、公正利用和扩大从政府那里争到的法令。
    意大利总工会所属农业工人联合会总书记、参议员博西在记者招待会上宣称：劳动群众在南意的斗争，已迫使政府采取为时过晚而且不充分的措施，然而，这仍然被认为是土地改革的第一步。他在谈及政府决定的内容时着重指出：用以分配的土地面积，不仅在全国荒地或开垦不足的土地总面积中占很小一部分，甚至也不及加拉勃利亚区大庄园面积的五分之一。博西在记者招待会上宣读了农业工人联合会指导委员会关于政府决定的决议。该决议对意大利民主力量，首先是意大利工人阶级给予南部农民运动的帮助，表示感谢。
