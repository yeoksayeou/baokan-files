First, the heads of business studies in various subjects introduced the study situation of each group: at present, more than 1,700 people in the city are participating in business studies. Each group takes the book "Ideological and Political Education of Soviet Students" as the main reference book, and uses group discussions, expert lectures, etc. to study how to implement ideological and political education into various courses, and how to achieve the combination of theory and practice in teaching. During the discussion, Ye Shengtao, Liu @ and others expressed their opinions successively. Ye Shengtao believes that "in the thirty-eight years since he engaged in education, it is the first time that he has seen teachers studying their business so seriously, and it is even more remarkable that everyone has made such a firm decision to work hard to improve their lessons." Liu @ pointed out in his speech that the decisive link in the current transformation of Beijing's education work lies in improving teachers' ideological education and, at the same time, improving their knowledge level. He called on everyone to pay full attention to studying and criticizing the old education, accepting the educational work experience of the liberated areas in the past ten years, and learning from the educational work experience of the Soviet Union in the thirty-two years since its founding.

    【北京讯】北京市中小学教职员联合会昨（三十一）日召开业务学习座谈会，讨论如何在学校中进行各科的教学问题。到会的有中小学教联所属中学各科业务学习委员会及小学学习委员会全体委员三十二人。华北人民政府教育部编审委员会叶圣陶、丁晓先、孟超，市教育局局长柳＠，华北大学二部三分部主任孙敬之，师范大学理学院院长黄国璋、化学系主任鲁宝重、体育系主任徐英超，北京艺专教务主任王朝闻等十七人均出席指导。座谈会由中小学教联主席薛成业主持，首先由各科业务学习负责人分别介绍各组学习情况：目前全市参加业务学习的共一千七百余人，各组都以“苏联学生的思想政治教育”一书为主要参考书，并以小组讨论、专家讲演等方式研究如何把思想政治教育贯彻到各种课程里去，以及如何在教学中做到理论与实际联系等问题。在讨论中，叶圣陶、柳＠等先后发表意见。叶圣陶认为“在他从事教育工作三十八年以来，第一次看到教员们这样认真的进行业务学习，而每个人又如此切实的下了决心为要把功课教好而努力进修，更是一件了不起的事情”。柳＠在讲话中指出：当前北京教育的改造工作，其决定环节在于提高教员的思想教育，同时提高知识水平。他号召大家在学习中要充分注意研究批判旧的教育，接受解放区十几年来的教育工作经验，并要学习苏联建国三十二年来的教育工作经验。
