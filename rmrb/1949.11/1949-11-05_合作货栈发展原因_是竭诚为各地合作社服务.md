Reasons for the Development of Cooperative Warehouses
　　Is Serving Cooperatives in Various Regions Wholeheartedly

　　The reason why cooperative warehouses have achieved such success is that they adhere to the tenet of serving cooperatives in various regions and members of the city wholeheartedly. In business, it introduces and purchases products from the city on behalf of cooperatives in various regions, charging only a slight handling fee of 0.5 percent, and striving to be fair and reasonable in price and quality. In addition, the warehouse can better provide accommodation for guests, charging only four catties of millet per person per day for food; other expenses such as rent, water and electricity, bedding rental fees, and other tips are all waived, saving members a lot of expenses.

　　At the beginning of the establishment of the cooperative warehouse, the leaders did not understand in their thinking that the cooperative warehouse was a good organizational form for opening up the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas. At the same time, the cadres leading the warehouse itself were weak and there was a lack of housing, which could not meet the requirements of cooperatives in various regions, thus affecting the development of the warehouse's business. In early August, the leaders of the cooperative headquarters began to pay attention and strengthened the cadres. In late August, the warehouse was divided into three sections: operation, accounting, and storage, each with its own responsibilities, strengthening business, so that purchases and sales on behalf of customers could be completed as scheduled according to the intentions of the customers. For example, when buying xinshi for Bohai, 16,000 catties were completed on a rainy day, which in the past (June or July) would have taken at least half a month to complete.

　　合作货栈发展原因
  　是竭诚为各地合作社服务
    合作货栈所以能获得这样的成绩是由于坚守着竭诚为各地合作社及本市社员服务的宗旨。在业务上替各地合作社介绍并代购本市的产品，只取百分之点五轻微手续费，在价格和质量上尽量做到公平合理。又该栈能较好地为客人设置了膳宿，每人每天只拿四斤小米的伙食费；其他如房租、水电费、被褥租赁费及其他小费一概免收。节省了社员的很大开支。
    合作货栈成立之初，领导上在思想上不明了合作货栈是打开城乡物资交流的一种良好的组织形式，同时货栈本身领导的干部弱及房子缺乏，不能满足各地合作社的要求，因此影响了该栈业务之开展。八月初合作总社领导上开始重视，并加强了干部。八月下旬又将货栈分为经营、会计、保管三科，各负专责，加强了业务，因此，代客买卖都能本着客人的意图如期完成。如给渤海买信石雨天即完成了一万六千斤，在过去（六月或七月）起码半月才能完成。
