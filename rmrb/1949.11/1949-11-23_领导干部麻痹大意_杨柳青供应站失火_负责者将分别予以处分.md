　　Leading Cadres Negligent
　　Yangliuqing Supply Station Fire
　　Responsible Persons to be Punished Accordingly

[Our Dispatch] The warehouse of the Yangliuqing Supply and Transit Station of the Tianjin Special District Treasury suffered a fire on the night of October 28th due to the negligence of leading cadres. The fire destroyed 1,500 hemp bags, 1,640 mats, 40 wooden purlins, 500 catties of grain straw, 5 rifles of the militia guarding the grass, 62 bullets, and 4 hand grenades, and burned to death three refugees (mother, son, and daughter) from Qingliansi Village, Wuqiang County, who were lodging there. After investigation, the main reasons were as follows: First, the district treasury itself has a serious bureaucratic style of leadership over the transit station, such as only asking the station for information and materials. The cadres at the station were ideologically confused, uneasy about their work, and were not given timely education and solutions after in-depth understanding. Also, the transit station cadres lacked a high sense of responsibility. Second, the transit station lacked the spirit of cherishing state property in the management of firewood and grass. For example, hemp bags, mats, and firewood were scattered on the two- or three-mile-long embankment without attempting to concentrate them in a suitable location. Cadres did not take shifts at night, harboring a侥幸 (jiǎoxìng) mentality, relying only on several militia members from the newly liberated areas who were not detached from production to stand guard. Third, the militia guarding the warehouse were frequently changed, taking turns on duty, lacking education, and harboring the idea of being conscripted for errands. They lacked political awareness and were not responsible for the management of the grain depot's materials. The armed guards of the warehouse also failed to proactively request solutions from higher authorities. After the incident, in addition to further investigation and reflection on the lessons learned, the leadership provided relief to the bereaved families and sorted out the materials. Xu Chi, the head of the transit station, was directly responsible for the fire due to dereliction of duty. The district treasury leadership was bureaucratic, and the special commissioner's office has requested the provincial government to impose appropriate punishments on them separately to strengthen the concept of cherishing state property among cadres in the financial departments in the future.

　　领导干部麻痹大意
　　杨柳青供应站失火
　　负责者将分别予以处分
    【本报讯】天津专区区库杨柳青供应转运站仓库，由于领导干部麻痹大意，于十月二十八日晚失火，焚毁麻袋一五○○条，席一六四○领，木檩四○根，谷草五○○斤，看草民兵大枪五枝，子弹六二粒，手榴弹四枚，烧死借宿的武强县青莲寺村难民大小三口（母、子女）。经过检查后，有以下几个主要原因：一、首先是区库本身对转运站的领导上存在着严重的官僚主义作风，如只向站要情况要材料，站上干部思想混乱，不安心工作，没深入了解给予及时教育解决，以及转运站干部缺乏高度责任心。二、转运站对柴草的保管，缺乏爱护国家资财的精神，如麻袋、席子、柴草均散放在二、三里长的大堤上，不设法集中到适当地点。干部夜间不值班，存在侥幸心理，只依靠新解放地区几个不脱离生产民兵站岗。三、护库民兵经常更换，轮流当班，缺乏教育，存在着支差的思想，缺乏政治觉悟，对粮库物资管理不负责。护库武装，亦未主动向上级请示解决。事件发生后，领导上除进一步检查和检讨教训外，并对被难家属予以救济，对物资加以整理。转运站站长徐池失职是失火的直接负责者，区库领导官僚主义，专署已呈请省府分别予以适当处分，以加强今后财政部门干部对爱护国家资财的观念。
