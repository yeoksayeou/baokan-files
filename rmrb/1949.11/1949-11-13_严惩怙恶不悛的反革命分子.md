    Severely Punish the Obdurate and Unrepentant Counter-Revolutionaries
    The Beijing Military Control Commission Military Law Department sentenced Wang Xiyun, Tong Baogong, Tang Qi and other three principal criminals of the Kuomintang secret agent bandits who seriously disrupted revolutionary order to death, and executed them by shooting yesterday. Accomplices such as Huang Jian were sentenced to imprisonment. This represents the demands of the people of Beijing, implements the resolutions of the First All-Circles People's Representative Conference of Beijing, and is a correct disposition taken in accordance with Article 7 of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.
    The evil deeds of the Kuomintang secret agent bandits have long been intolerable to the people of Beijing. At the First All-Circles People's Representative Conference of Beijing, representatives accused the counter-revolutionary crimes of the Kuomintang secret agent bandits and passed a resolution demanding that the People's Government resolutely suppress the activities of counter-revolutionary elements. The crimes of Wang Xiyun and other criminals sentenced by the Military Law Department this time are the same as those of the five secret agents, including Li Junbo, who were sentenced to death last time. Before the liberation of Beijing, these Kuomintang secret agent bandits had already committed a series of serious counter-revolutionary crimes endangering the people. After the liberation of Beijing, they still disregarded the laws and decrees of the People's Government, did not confess and register with the public security organs, and did not surrender their weapons. Instead, they insidiously and viciously continued their counter-revolutionary activities, colluding with bandits and ruffians, and carrying out armed robbery, seriously infringing upon the safety of the people's lives and property and seriously disrupting the revolutionary order of the people's capital. The People's Government must resolutely arrest and severely punish such heinous, obdurate, and unrepentant counter-revolutionary elements hated by the people. To condone these counter-revolutionary elements is to be cruel to the people. We fully support the Beijing Military Control Commission Military Law Department's handling of the Wang Xiyun and other counter-revolutionary cases. The policy on which the handling of these cases is based is the principle stipulated in the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, that is, "to suppress all counter-revolutionary activities, severely punish all Kuomintang counter-revolutionary war criminals who collude with imperialism, betray the motherland, and oppose the people's democratic cause, and other obdurate and unrepentant principal counter-revolutionary elements." In the process of the trial, the Military Law Department not only conducted thorough investigations and interrogations, with conclusive evidence, but also, when sentencing, based the sentences on the severity of each criminal's crimes, and gave lenient treatment to those who could be leniently treated as much as possible. Only three vicious principal offenders were sentenced to death.
    From this case, people can once again see the correct policy of the People's Government of combining leniency and suppression towards counter-revolutionary elements. At the same time, this case once again tells us that the remnant bandits of the Kuomintang reactionaries will not be reconciled to death. After being fundamentally defeated, they will inevitably try every means to carry out counter-revolutionary conspiracies. Therefore, we must not have the slightest complacency or complacency, but must continue to heighten our vigilance, resolutely eliminate all counter-revolutionary activities, consolidate revolutionary order, and defend the interests of the people and the people's motherland.

    严惩怙恶不悛的反革命分子
    北京市军事管制委员会军法处对于严重破坏革命秩序的国民党特务匪徒王喜云、佟宝功、唐岐等三个首要凶犯判处死刑，于昨日执行枪决，并对从犯黄健等分别判处徒刑，这是代表着北京市各界人民的要求，执行北京市第一届各界人民代表会议的决议，依据中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领第七条的规定所采取的正确处置。
    国民党特务匪徒的为非作恶，久为北京人民所不能容忍。在北京市第一届各界人民代表会议上，代表们曾纷纷控诉国民党特务匪徒的反革命罪行，并且通过了决议，要求人民政府坚决镇压反革命分子的活动。此次军管会军法处所判决的王喜云等凶犯的罪状，和前次被判决死刑的特务李峻波等五人的罪状是相同的，这些国民党特务匪徒，在北京解放以前，就已经作了一连串严重危害人民的反革命罪恶，在北京解放以后，仍不顾人民政府的法令，不向公安机关坦白登记，不交出武器，反而阴险狠毒地继续其反革命活动，勾结土匪流氓，武装实行抢劫，严重地侵犯人民生命财产的安全，严重地破坏人民首都的革命秩序。对于这样恶贯满盈怙恶不悛为人民所痛恨的反革命分子，人民政府必须坚决加以逮捕，依法严惩。对于这些反革命分子的姑息，就是对于人民的残忍。我们完全拥护北京市军管会军法处对于王喜云等反革命案件的处理。在处理这些案件中所根据的政策，就是中国人民政协共同纲领所规定的原则，即“镇压一切反革命活动，严厉惩罚一切勾结帝国主义、背叛祖国、反对人民民主事业的国民党反革命战争罪犯和其他怙恶不悛的反革命首要分子”。在审判的过程中，军法处不但进行了周密的调查与审讯，证据确凿，而且在判决时又根据各该犯的罪恶的轻重，分别处刑，对于可以宽大处理的都尽可能给以宽大的处理，只有三名凶恶的首犯，才被处以极刑。
    从这个案件中，人们又一次可以看到人民政府对反革命分子宽大与镇压相结合的正确政策。同时，这个案件又一次告诉我们，国民党反动派残余匪帮是不会甘心死亡的，他们在根本被打倒之后，必然要千方百计地实行反革命的阴谋活动，因此，我们决不可有丝毫麻痹自满的心理，而要继续提高警惕性，坚决肃清一切反革命活动，巩固革命秩序，保卫人民和人民祖国的利益。
