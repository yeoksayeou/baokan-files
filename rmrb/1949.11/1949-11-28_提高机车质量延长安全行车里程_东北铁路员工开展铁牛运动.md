Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 26th. Northeast railway locomotive, rolling stock, and engineering staff are conducting a competition to create new records in various aspects such as improving locomotive quality, extending safe locomotive mileage, vehicle dispatching, and improving track level, and have achieved significant results. This movement is called the "Iron Ox Movement" because the Iron Ox locomotive of the Harbin Railway Bureau first created a new record of safely traveling more than 100,650 kilometers without accidents in eighteen months from August 1947 to February 1949, exceeding two Class A inspection periods (according to regulations, locomotives must undergo a Class A inspection every 50,000 kilometers to maintain locomotive quality). This year, the quality of locomotives and various aspects of railway work in Northeast China have been generally improved. Following the "Iron Ox," nine more locomotives in various railway bureaus in Northeast China have safely traveled more than 100,000 kilometers. Therefore, the Northeast Railway Administration decided to universally organize "People's Iron Ox Teams" on this basis and launch the "Iron Ox Movement." This competition movement was proposed at the locomotive affairs meeting held by the Northeast Railway Administration on September 27th this year, and was immediately extended from locomotive affairs and train operations to rolling stock and engineering, becoming a more extensive, planned, and organized movement than any previous competition. The Northeast Railway Administration uniformly stipulated the specific conditions for participating in the People's Iron Ox Team. Drivers, stokers, and vehicle dispatchers from all locomotive depots in Northeast China can apply to be members based on this standard, and can become formal members after being approved by the production management committee of each depot and the railway bureau. Those who are determined to participate but have poor conditions can be approved as reserve members. All locomotives operated by Iron Ox team members are hung with the honorary plaques issued by the railway bureau, and all railway employees regard it as an infinite honor to become members of the People's Iron Ox Team. As of now, the Harbin Railway Bureau has had 64 locomotives and 11 carriage groups that have won the honorary title of "People's Iron Ox Team." The Qiqihar Railway Bureau has produced the heroic locomotive "One and T631," which broke the Class A inspection record and safely traveled 140,000 kilometers. The Xie Haichun shunting team of the Suihua first-class marshalling station of the Harbin Railway Bureau has not had an accident for more than four years from the "August 15th" liberation in 1945 to November this year and has been selected as the "Iron Ox Shunting Team."

　　提高机车质量延长安全行车里程
  　东北铁路员工开展铁牛运动
    【新华社沈阳二十六日电】东北铁路机务、车务、工务员工，正在提高机车质量、延长机车安全行车里程、车辆调度以及提高线路水平等各方面，进行着创造新纪录的竞赛运动，并已获得显著成绩。这一运动被称为“铁牛运动”，原因是哈尔滨路局的铁牛号机车，在一九四七年八月到一九四九年二月的十八个月中，首先创造了超过两个甲检期（按规定机车每行走五万公里须经甲种检修一次，以保持机车质量），安全行走十万零六千五百余公里未出事故的新纪录。今年东北机车的质量，和铁道工作的各方面均有普遍的提高，继“铁牛号”之后，东北各路局又有九台机车安全行车超过了十万公里。因此，东北铁路总局决定在这一基础上普遍组织“人民铁牛队”，开展“铁牛运动”。这一竞赛运动今年九月二十七日在东北铁路总局召开的机务会上提出后，就立即由机务、乘务扩展到车务、工务方面，成为比过去任何一次竞赛都更广泛、更有计划和更有组织的运动。东北铁路总局统一规定了参加人民铁牛队的具体条件，全东北各机务段的司机、司炉和车辆调度员等都可以根据这一标准申请为队员，经各该段的生产管理委员会通过和路局批准，即可为正式队员；凡决心参加而条件较差的，可准为预备队员。凡是铁牛队员所包乘的机车上，都挂着路局所发的光荣牌，所有铁路员工们都以能成为人民铁牛队员为无限光荣。截至目前为止，哈尔滨铁路局已有六十四台机车和十一个包车组获得了“人民铁牛队”的光荣牌；齐齐哈尔铁路局涌现了打破甲检纪录，安全走行十四万公里的英雄机车“一又Ｔ六三一号”。哈尔滨路局绥化一等编成站的谢海春调车组，从一九四五年“八、一五”解放到今年十一月共四年多没有发生事故，已被选为“铁牛调车组”。
