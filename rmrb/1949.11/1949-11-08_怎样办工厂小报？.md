　　How to Run a Factory Newsletter?
　　Yue Weiming
　　Currently, factories and large enterprises in cities like Beijing and Tianjin have all published their own newsletters and periodicals. These newspapers have played a certain role in the work of each factory. However, they have also encountered many difficulties, such as not knowing how to edit them, workers not liking to read them, and a lack of submissions. Now I will discuss a few points on running a factory newsletter for your reference.
　　Factory newsletters are mainly for factory workers and staff to read, and their mission should be to promote the work of the factory, increase production, and raise the class consciousness of the workers. It seems that some units are not clear on this point. For example, the newsletters they run seem to be for superiors to read, only publishing work plans and summaries (of course, this is not to say that these things are not needed), or relatively stiff articles, or feelings and empty discussions that are far from the work and the actual situation. Therefore, these newspapers are difficult to play their role.
　　The content of the newsletter should include these two aspects: on the one hand, implementing leadership, and on the other hand, reflecting the opinions of the masses. Therefore, on the one hand, it is necessary to inform everyone of the intentions and work plans of the leadership so that everyone has a direction; on the other hand, it is necessary to reflect the lives, thoughts, problems encountered in the work, and experiences of the masses, in order to promote the entire movement and seek progress in the work. The reason why most of the newsletters are not well-run and the workers do not like to read them now is because the content is not in line with the actual needs of the workers and is divorced from the actual situation. For example, some newsletters not only publish some summaries, calls to action, and empty, boring papers, but also publish some poems with no content. It is difficult to see from the newsletters what work is being done in the factory, to what extent the work is being carried out, what problems there are in the work, and what reflections and requirements the workers have. I think that if the newsletter is to be run well, it must be linked to the work and the actual situation. For example, the actual activities before and after a certain work begins, the difficulties encountered, the solutions, the experience in the work, the model figures of the movement, the creations in the work, etc., should be published in a large amount.
　　Since running a newsletter is to promote the work of the unit and raise the awareness of the workers and staff, then the administrative and trade union leaders of the factory (or enterprise unit) should first use this tool. Recently, some local newsletters have not been run well because the administration and trade union are indifferent to running the newsletter. They do not implement their intentions and plans through the newsletter, and they do not pay attention to the problems and opinions reflected by the masses. Therefore, the problem of the newsletter being disconnected from the work has arisen. Secondly, a key issue in whether a newsletter is run well or not is whether the newsletter is run by the masses. At present, in many factory newsletters, only a few people participate in the work, and in this way, the problems of work and actual activities cannot be fully reflected. I think: the newsletter should rely on the masses to run it. On the one hand, it is necessary to mobilize all workers and staff to write articles for the newsletter, and on the other hand, it is necessary to specifically help the workers and comrades to write articles, tell them what they should write, how to write, and so on. Only when the people who write the articles are improved can the newsletter be run well. Two points should be noted here: first, the leading comrades should take the lead, write articles, and urge everyone. Second, it is necessary to praise the comrades who often write articles so that their enthusiasm for writing can be consolidated, and then it can be run well.

### 怎样办工厂小报？

　　怎样办工厂小报？
    岳未明
    目前，京津等城市的工厂和大的企业单位，大都出版了自己的小报期刊。这些报纸，对各工厂工作来说，都起了一定的作用。但同时也碰到了不少的困难，如不知如何编，工友不爱看，没有稿子等等。现在我谈几点办小报的意见，供大家参考。
    工厂的小报，主要是办给工厂工人和职员看的，它的任务应该是为了推动工厂的工作、提高生产、和提高工人的阶级觉悟的。这一点似乎有些单位也不明确，比如办的小报好象是给上级看的，光登些工作计划和总结（当然不是说这些东西不需要），或者是比较生硬的文章，或者是与工作与实际情形离的很远的感想和空洞的议论等，因此，这些报纸就很难起它的作用。
    小报的内容应包括这两方面：一方面贯彻领导，一方面要反映群众的意见。所以，一方面要把领导上的意图、工作计划告给大家使大家有个方向；一方面要把群众的生活、思想、在工作中碰着的问题和经验反映出来，借以推动整个运动，求得工作的进展。现在，大部分小报办得不好工人不爱看的原因，就是因为内容不切合工人的实际要求，脱离实际情况，比如，有些小报不是光刊登一些总结、号召，和空洞枯燥的论文之外，便是登一些没什么内容的诗歌等等，从小报上很难看出厂里正在搞什么工作，工作进行到什么程度，工作中有什么问题，工人群众中有些什么反映和要求。我觉得，小报要办好，必须与工作和实际情形联系起来，比如某一工作开始前后的实际活动，碰到的困难，解决的办法，工作中的经验，运动的模范人物，工作中的创造等等，应拿大量的篇幅刊登。
    既然办小报是为了推动本单位的工作，提高职工群众的觉悟，那末，工厂（或企业单位）的行政和职工会的领导上首先应利用这个工具。近来，有些地方小报办得不好，就是因为行政和职工会对办报漠不关心，领导上有什么意图和计划，也不通过小报贯彻，群众中反映的问题和意见也不重视，因此，就产生了小报和工作脱节的毛病。其次，小报办好办不好的一个关键问题，就是要看小报是不是由群众来办的。现在有不少工厂的小报，参加工作的只是少数几个人，这样是不会把工作和实际活动问题等反映全面的。我认为：小报要依靠群众办，一方面要发动全体职工为小报写稿，另一方面要具体帮助职工同志写稿，告诉他们应该写些什么，怎样写等等。只有把写稿的人提高了，小报也才能办好。这里要注意的两点是：第一、领导同志要亲自动手，要写稿子，督促大家。第二、是要多表扬常写稿的同志，使其写稿的热情巩固下来，才办得好。
