　　Higher Education Department of the Ministry of Education Convened Symposium on Political Economy Teaching Yesterday
　　Political Economy Teaching Committee Established

[Our Newspaper] The Higher Education Department of the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government convened a symposium yesterday (November 4th) of more than thirty teachers from universities in Beijing and Tianjin who lecture on political economy, including Shen Zhiyuan, Fan Hong, Wang Yanan, and Guo Dali, to discuss issues related to the teaching of political economy, and established a Political Economy Teaching Committee directly under the Higher Education Department.

Political economy is one of the required courses for liberal arts and law colleges of universities as stipulated by the former North China Higher Education Association. Since the beginning of this autumn semester, universities have successively added and started lecturing on it. After each university reported on the teaching situation at yesterday's meeting, Wang Xuewen, professor at the Marxism-Leninism Institute and expert in economics, explained that the purpose of studying political economy is to learn to apply Marxist-Leninist theory to participate in the construction of New Democracy. He emphasized that in the course of study, attention should be paid to criticizing the viewpoints of bourgeois economics. He also pointed out that studying political economy especially requires studying the five economic forms of the New China (state-owned economy, cooperative economy, private capitalist economy, small-scale production economy, state capitalist economy). Wang Xuewen also pointed out that in teaching, real-world materials should be added to supplement textbooks, so that students can digest and benefit from the knowledge. Qian Junrui, Deputy Minister of Education, emphasized that studying political economy should grasp the general laws of economic development and study the laws of economic development of New Democracy, understanding that only with Marxist-Leninist economic theories and the economic policies passed by the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference can the construction of the new democratic economy be correctly led. The economic theories of the bourgeoisie will only lead us to old democracy and colonial economy, which we must criticize. He called on professors who have been studying old economics to seriously study Marxist-Leninist political economy in order to better serve the people.

At the meeting, it was decided to form a Political Economy Teaching Committee composed of nine people, including Wang Xuewen, Wang Yanan, Fan Hong, Shen Zhiyuan, Rao Yusu, Guo Dali, He Tingjie, Qi Zuji, and Ji Taoda, with Wang Xuewen as the chairman, responsible for the formulation of the teaching syllabus and leading the research and improvement of teaching in various universities.

　　政治经济学教学问题高教司昨召集座谈会
  　政治经济学教委会已组成
    【本报讯】中央人民政府教育部高等教育司昨（十一月四日）召集京津各大学讲授政治经济学的教员沈志远、樊弘、王亚南、郭大力等三十余人座谈政治经济学讲授问题，组成政治经济学教学委员会，直属高教司。
    政治经济学是前华北高教会所规定的各大学文法学院必修课程之一，今秋开学以来，各大学均先后添设并开课讲授，昨日会上各校报告教学情况后，马列学院教授、经济学专家王学文说明学习政治经济学的目的在于学会应用马列主义理论参加新民主主义建设，学习中要注意批判资产阶级经济学的观点，他同时又指出学习政治经济学尤其要研究新中国的五种经济形态（国营经济，合作社经济，私人资本主义经济，小生产经济，国家资本主义经济）。王学文并指出在教学中应联系实际补充现实教材，要使学生消化受用。教育部副部长钱俊瑞着重说明学习政治经济学，应掌握经济发展的一般法则，并研究新民主主义经济的发展法则，了解只有以马列主义的经济学说和人民政协所通过的经济政策才能正确领导新民主经济的建设，资产阶级的经济学说只会引导我们走向旧民主主义和殖民地经济，我们必须加以批判。他号召一向研究旧经济学的教授们认真研究马列主义政治经济学，以期更好地为人民服务。
    会上当决定向王学文、王亚南、樊弘、沈志远、饶毓苏、郭大力、何挺杰、齐祖辑、季陶达等九人组成政治经济学教学委员会，由王学文为主任委员，负责教学大纲的拟定及领导各校教学的研究和改进。
