Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 17th: The full text of the speech by Adylbish, representative of the Mongolian People's Republic, at the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference is as follows:

　　Comrades!

　　On behalf of the working people of the Mongolian People's Republic, I extend fraternal greetings to you all!

　　The Chinese people's struggle over the years has achieved brilliant and splendid victory. Today, I have the opportunity to extend warm congratulations to the great Chinese people, and I am extremely happy.

　　The victory of the Chinese people has made it possible for us to freely come to the capital of New China to discuss important issues of the trade union movement in Asian countries.

　　The reactionary leaders of the British Trades Union Congress and the American Congress of Industrial Organizations have become pawns of international monopoly groups, attempting to undermine the unity of the working class and cause division and disputes in the Asian trade union movement. However, their attempt has completely failed. We, representing the workers of Asia and the world, have gathered here regardless of national, racial, political, or religious boundaries. In the struggle for peace, democracy, and the legitimate rights of workers, against the war-mongering imperialists, our fraternal cooperation, mutual support, and common awareness of the interests and aims of the world democratic movement have brought us this unity. The World Federation of Trade Unions has done a great job in this regard.

　　The history of the peoples of Asian countries is a history of the struggle waged by the working people for freedom and independence for many years. The threat of an economic crisis, bringing new suffering to the working people, is already approaching capitalist countries. We are holding this conference at a time when British and American imperialists are preparing for war and infringing upon the minimum freedom of the working class. This conference will deliver a powerful blow to the despicable plans of the new war instigators, and further unite the working class of Asian and Australian countries in the struggle for peace and democracy.

　　Not many days ago, we celebrated the thirty-second anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution in the Soviet Union, which produced reliable friends and protectors of workers all over the world and is an unyielding fighter for peace and democracy. With the assistance of the Soviet Union, the Mongolian People's Republic was able to emerge and develop in a consolidated manner. During the twenty-eight years of independence and freedom, with the assistance of the Soviet Union, we have seen a completely new development in our country. In the past, we had no industry, and therefore no working class. Under the leadership of the People's Revolutionary Party and the government led by Marshal Choibalsan, we have developed national industry in the years of democratic development, created cadres of the working class, and seventy percent of our working class has been unified in the organization of trade unions.

　　Our conference will undoubtedly further consolidate the ranks of the working class in the world and in all colonies and dependent countries of Asia and Australia, and contribute to the cause of democratic peace.

　　Long live the World Federation of Trade Unions!

　　Long live the unity of the international trade union movement!

　　Long live the Asian working class!

　　Long live Stalin, the great leader of the working people of the world!

　　蒙古人民共和国代表
  　阿德利比什讲话
    【新华社北京十七日电】蒙古人民共和国代表阿德利比什在亚澳工会会议上的讲话全文如下：
    各位同志！
    我代表蒙古人民共和国的劳动人民，谨向各位致兄弟的敬礼！
    中国人民多年来的斗争，得到了辉煌灿烂的胜利。我今天得到向伟大中国人民致热烈祝贺的机会，衷心不胜愉快之至。
    中国人民的胜利，使我们有了自由的来到新中国的首都，讨论亚洲各国职工会运动重要问题的可能。
    英国工联总会及美国产业工会的反动领袖们变成国际垄断集团的爪牙，多方企图破坏工人阶级的统一，使亚洲职工运动发生分裂和纠纷，但是他们的这个企图完全失败了。我们代表亚洲及世界各国的劳动者，我们不分民族、人种、政治观点和宗教的畛域，齐集在这里了。在为和平民主及劳动者之正当权利而反对挑拨战争之帝国主义者的斗争中，我们的兄弟合作、互相提携及世界民主运动的利益和宗旨的共同意识，使我们有了这种统一。关于这方面，世界工联作了很大的工作了。
    亚洲各国人民的历史是劳动人民多年来为自由独立所进行之斗争的斗争史。给劳动人民带来新痛苦的经济危机的威胁，已经逼近资本主义国度。在英美帝国主义者在准备战争并侵犯工人阶级最低限度之自由的现在时期，我们举行本代表会议。本代表会议将对于新战争挑拨者的卑劣计划予以强有力的打击，和更加统一亚澳各国工人阶级为和平民主的斗争。
    不几天前，我们举行了产生全世界各国劳动者的可靠的朋友及保护者，为和平民主作不屈不挠的斗争者苏联国家的伟大十月社会主义革命三十二周年纪念。借苏联国家的援助，蒙古人民共和国得以产生及发展巩固。我们在独立自由的二十八年当中，得到苏联国家的援助，使自己国家有了面目一新的发展。过去我们没有工业，所以也就没有工人阶级。我们在却尔巴桑元帅所领导的人民革命党及政府的领导下，在民主发展的年份里发展了民族工业，产生了工人阶级的干部，我们的工人阶级的百分之七十已统一在职工会的组织里。
    我们的代表会议，无疑的能够进一步巩固世界及亚澳一切殖民地和从属国工人阶级的队伍，有贡献于民主和平的事业。
    全世界工会联合会万岁！
    国际职工运动统一万岁！
    亚洲工人阶级万岁！
    全世界劳动人民的伟大领袖斯大林万岁！
