Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 28th. A compilation of TASS reports indicates that Pravda, Izvestia, and Red Star have recently published articles commenting on the recent meeting of the U.S., British, and French foreign ministers in Paris. The newspapers unanimously expose that the ruling groups of the United States and Western European countries are further supporting West German aggressive forces, making it the military and economic center of Western Europe, to serve the United States' insane plan to establish world hegemony. At the same time, it emphasizes that the contradictions between the United States and the ruling classes of Western Europe are increasing day by day.

Izvestia published a commentary by Kudryavtsev stating that the United States, at the Paris meeting, demanded that its accomplices incorporate West Germany into the system of the aggressive Atlantic Alliance as soon as possible. This demand was made by the West German puppet "Chancellor" Adenauer in the form of a memorandum, through the U.S. High Commissioner for Germany, McCloy. The main points of the McCloy-Adenauer memorandum include placing West German coal production under the control of Western Europe (the United States) and increasing West German steel production to nearly 15 million tons, while canceling the previous unilateral decision by the three Western countries to set a maximum limit of 11.5 million tons. French Foreign Minister Schuman, with some reservations, agreed in principle to stop dismantling the Thyssen steel factory in Hamburg and agreed to incorporate the West German "state" into the aggressive Atlantic Treaty system, which is evidence of the French ruling class surrendering under the pressure of U.S. monopoly capitalists and sacrificing French national security. Kudryavtsev pointed out that the official communique cautiously maintained silence on the growing internal contradictions among the three countries, but as signs of economic crisis became increasingly apparent, the pressure exerted by the United States on Western European countries became greater, and the contradictions among the main partners of the Atlantic bloc became more acute. Kudryavtsev finally pointed out that this meeting most outrageously violated the decisions of the Potsdam Conference and the agreements reached at the 1949 Paris Conference of the Foreign Ministers of the four countries, the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France. However, any attempt to solve the German problem without the participation of the Soviet Union and without considering the interests of the German people who established the German Democratic Republic is doomed to failure.

Red Star published a commentary by Tanin and Skorov stating that the hasty convening of the Paris meeting first confirmed the fact that the establishment of the German Democratic Republic, which became a turning point in European history, threw the instigators of a new war into confusion and overturned their plans. The ruling groups of Western countries are trying to support the reactionary militarist Bonn "state" by various means, using it as a base for new imperialist adventures in Western Europe. This is one of the main issues discussed at the Paris meeting. The official communique shows that the three-country meeting was not limited to discussing the issue of Germany joining the "European Council" under the guise of the North Atlantic Alliance, but also, in order to make this alliance more effective, they also discussed stopping the dismantling of West German enterprises and expanding the power of the so-called Ruhr International Authority to other industrial areas in Western Europe, namely the Ruhr and Lorraine. At their meeting, the three foreign ministers discussed Acheson's proposal to stop dismantling German enterprises, which surprised Britain and France. The ruling groups of Great Britain cannot fail to see that this proposal is a direct threat to the interests of British industrialists. British monopoly capitalists understand that West German enterprises, funded by U.S. monopoly capital, will be serious competitors to them. It was precisely because of the fear of German competition that once forced the British occupation authorities to accelerate the dismantling of West German enterprises. However, Acheson succeeded in Paris in getting his partners to agree to stop dismantling military industries. The reason why the United States favors stopping dismantling is not only to strengthen West Germany as a reactionary stronghold of anti-democratic forces, but also to pursue selfish goals. U.S. monopoly capitalists are basically trying to use the dismantling issue and the Ruhr issue to establish a "European Economic Union." According to the plan of the U.S. occupation authorities, the Ruhr (including the enterprises originally scheduled for dismantling) and the industrial areas of West Germany will become the core of this alliance. However, because the decisive role in this alliance will belong to the United States, U.S. monopoly capitalists are counting on not only establishing their complete control over Germany, but also extending this control to the entire Western Europe. The working people of Britain and France are well aware of the dangerous nature of these measures, which will lead to the full restoration of Germany's war potential, create a new hotbed of aggression in Europe, and thus constitute a threat to peace and security. Therefore, Bevin, and especially Schuman, found themselves in an extremely difficult position at the Paris meeting, and they were forced to use flexible and ambiguous euphemisms to conceal their true agreement to the demands of U.S. monopoly capitalists. Red Star also discussed the fundamental differences and increasingly acute contradictions among the monopoly capitalist groups in Western countries, stating that: In solving various problems in Germany and the whole of Western Europe, the United States' efforts to maintain a controlling position have long aroused dissatisfaction among a section of the ruling classes in Britain and France. The United States' intention to transform the so-called Ruhr International Authority into a "super-cartel of heavy industry" has caused particular anxiety. This institution will be able to obtain raw materials in all industrial areas of Western Europe—the Ruhr, Saar, Lorraine, Luxembourg, and Belgium—and process and manufacture them. This fact clearly reflects the United States' hope to establish its control over the most important industrial areas of Western Europe. Most significant is the fact that when the influence of the German Democratic Republic is constantly growing and strengthening, Western countries are drafting plans to reorganize the puppet West German "state," splitting it into new separate "states." In particular, the establishment of the so-called "Southwest German State" is being considered. The establishment of this U.S.-affiliated "state" will result in more than half of the French occupation zone falling under the direct control of the United States. These facts prove the existence of deep contradictions among the ruling classes of the United States, Britain, and France.

Pravda published a commentary by Marinin stating that the extremely vague communique of the three foreign ministers' meeting acknowledges that the future policy of the U.S., Britain, and France towards West Germany is primarily determined by the occupation regulations. They reiterated that the occupation system in West Germany and the related stationing of U.S., British, and French armed forces in the center of Europe are unrestricted and must continue permanently. Marinin pointed out: There is no doubt that this decision regarding the Ruhr giants further intensified the internal squabbling among the war-mongers over who should be the main assistant to the United States' cause in Europe: Britain, France, or the German imperialists? In the secret chambers of the North Atlantic system, talking about "unity and solidarity" of interests has long been outdated. The Paris foreign ministers' meeting once again proved that the imperialist conspiracy of the British, French, and American blocs is directly opposed to peace and international security, and it is also directly opposed to the fundamental interests of German democracy. The camp of peace and democracy supports the growing democratic forces in Germany by strengthening the struggle against war-mongers and preparing to respond to the imperialists' conspiracy.

　　美英法三外长仓促集会巴黎
  　妄图进一步扶植西德侵略力量  充分暴露侵略集团间矛盾日深
  　苏联各报发表评论揭露
    【新华社北京二十八日电】综合塔斯社报道，真理报、消息报、红星报最近均发表专文，评论不久以前在巴黎举行的美、英、法三外长会议。各报一致揭发了美国和西欧国家统治集团正进一步扶植西德侵略力量，使之成为西欧的军事与经济中心，以服务于美国建立世界霸权的疯狂计划。同时强调指出：美国与西欧统治阶级间的矛盾正日益增加。
    消息报发表库德里雅夫契夫的评论称：美国在巴黎会议上要求它的同伙，尽早将西德纳入侵略性的大西洋联盟的体系内。这个要求是西德傀儡“总理”阿登纳以备忘录的形式，经由美国驻德高级专员麦克洛埃提出的。麦克洛埃——阿登纳备忘录的要点中，包括将西德的煤产置于西欧（美国）的支配之下，并将西德的钢铁产量增加到几近一千五百万吨，而取消前此三西方国家所片面地决定的一千一百五十万吨最高限额。法国外长舒曼仅以某些保留，原则上同意了停止拆卸汉堡蒂森钢铁工厂，并同意将西德“国家”纳入侵略性的大西洋公约体系，这是法国统治阶级在美国垄断资本家的压力之下投降并牺牲法国国家安全的证据。库德里雅夫契夫指出，官方公报对于三国内部日益增长的矛盾，谨慎地保持缄默，但随着经济危机迹象愈益增强，美国加于西欧各国的压力就愈加重大，而大西洋集团的主要伙伴间的矛盾，也就表现得愈为尖锐。库德里雅夫契夫最后指出：这次会议最疯狂地违反了波茨坦会议的决定和一九四九年苏、美、英、法四国外长巴黎会议所达成的协议。但是任何想没有苏联参加、不考虑建立了德意志民主共和国的德国人民的利益而解决德国问题的企图，是注定要失败的。
    红星报发表塔宁和斯可罗夫的评论称：巴黎会议之仓促召开，首先就证实了一项事实，即在欧洲史上成为转折点的德意志民主共和国的成立，使新战争的鼓动者陷于混乱，并推翻了他们的计划。西方国家的统治集团，正力图用各种方法来支持反动的军国主义的波恩“国家”，把它作为在西欧进行新帝国主义冒险的基地。这就是巴黎会议上所讨论的主要问题之一。官方公报表明三国会议不仅限于讨论德国加入作为北大西洋联盟之幌子的“欧洲委员会”的问题，而且为了使这一联盟更为有效，它们也讨论了停止拆卸西德企业及把所谓鲁尔国际管制局的权力扩大到西欧其他工业区即窿尔和洛林的问题。三外长在他们的会议上，讨论了艾奇逊所提出而使英法吃惊的停止拆卸德国企业问题。大不列颠的统治集团不能不看到这一建议是对英国工业家利益的直接威胁。英国垄断资本家了解，被美国垄断资本所资助的西德企业，对他们将是严重的竞争者。正是由于对德国竞争的恐惧，曾一度迫使英国占领当局加速对西德企业的拆卸。但是，艾奇逊在巴黎获得了成功，使他的伙伴同意停止拆卸军事工业。美国之所以赞成停止拆卸，不仅是在于想加强西德作为反民主力量的反动堡垒，而且也在追逐贪图私利的目的。美国的垄断资本家基本上是试图利用拆卸问题和鲁尔问题，以建立“欧洲经济联盟”。而根据美国占领当局的计划，鲁尔（包括原定拆卸的企业）和西德的工业区将成为这个联盟的核心。但是，因为这个联盟中的决定性作用将属于美国，所以美国垄断资本家是在算计着不仅要建立他们对德国的完全控制，而且要将这种控制扩展到整个西欧。英国和法国的劳动人民很清楚地知道这些措施的危险性质，将引致德国战争潜力的充分恢复，将在欧洲造成新的侵略温床，因而构成对和平和安全的威胁。因此，贝文，尤其是舒曼在巴黎会议中陷于极端困难的地位，他们被迫用含有伸缩性的和模棱两可的饰辞，来掩盖他们对美国垄断资本家的要求的真正协议。红星报也论及西方国家垄断资本家集团间的基本歧异和日益尖锐的矛盾称：在解决德国和整个西欧的种种问题时，美国的努力把持控制的地位，早就在英法统治阶级的某一部分人中间引起了不满。美国之将所谓鲁尔国际管制局转变为“重工业的超级卡特尔”的意图引起了特别的焦虑。该机构将能在一切西欧的工业区域——鲁尔、萨尔、洛林、卢森堡和比利时——获得原料，并予以加工制造。这个事实清楚地反映了美国希望建立其对西欧最重要的工业区域的控制。最有意义的是下述事实，即当德意志民主共和国的影响正不断地增长和加强的时候，西方国家已在拟订改组傀儡西德“国家”的计划，将它分裂为新的分立的“国家”。特别是所谓“西南德意志国家”的建立正在考虑中。这个附属于美国的“国家”的建立，其结果将是法国占领区的一半以上落于美国的直接控制之下。这些事实证明了美英法三国统治阶级间存在着深刻的矛盾。
    真理报发表马里宁的评论称，三外长会议极端暖昧的公报，承认美、英、法对西德的未来政策，首先是由占领法规来决定。他们再度强调，在西德的占领制度以及与之有关的美、英、法武装部队的驻留欧洲中心地带，不受任何限制，而且须永久继续下去。马里宁指出：无可怀疑，这一个关于鲁尔巨头的决定，进一步加剧了战争贩子内部对谁应当担任美国在欧洲之事业的主要助手的争吵：英、法，还是德帝国主义者？在北大西洋体系的密室里，谈论利益的“一致和团结”，很久以前就已经不合时宜了。巴黎外长会议再度证明了英、法、美集团的帝国主义阴谋，直接反对和平与国际安全，同时也是直接反对德国民主的基本利益。和平与民主的阵营以加强反对战争贩子的斗争和准备，来支持增长着的德国民主势力，回答帝国主义者的阴谋。
