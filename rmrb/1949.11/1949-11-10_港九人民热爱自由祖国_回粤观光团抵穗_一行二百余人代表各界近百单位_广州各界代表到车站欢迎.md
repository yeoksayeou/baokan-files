Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 9th. A sightseeing delegation to Guangdong, organized by people from all walks of life in Hong Kong and Kowloon, arrived in Guangzhou on the afternoon of the 6th on the first special train since Guangzhou's liberation from Shenzhen. Rao Zhangfeng, representative of the South China Sub-bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial and Municipal People's Government, and representatives of people from all walks of life in the city, welcomed them at the station.

The Hong Kong and Kowloon People's Sightseeing Delegation to Guangdong includes seventy-three people from the Hong Kong labor sector, representing thirty-nine units; forty people from the education sector, representing thirty-one units; twenty-five women, representing fourteen units; forty people from the cultural and artistic circles; twenty-two young people, representing fifteen units; and sixty-four people from the industrial and commercial sectors. Among them are labor leaders from various industries, principals, professors, students, directors, actors, writers, engineers, doctors, lawyers, reporters, factory owners, and merchants, as well as professional women and young people from various industries. The head of the delegation is Zhang Zhennan (leader of the Hong Kong labor sector), and the deputy head is Lu Dong (leader of the Hong Kong education sector); the leader of the labor sector is Zhang Zhennan, and the deputy leader is Zhang Dongquan; the leader of the women's sector is Gao Yan, and the deputy leader is Lao Jieling; the leader of the youth sector is Zhou Zhang, and the deputy leader is Li Ye; the leader of the education sector is Lu Dong, and the deputy leader is Cheng Qingsheng; the leader of the cultural and artistic circles is Sima Wensen, and the deputy leader is Chen Canyun; the leader of the industrial and commercial sectors is Chen Qiuan, and the deputy leader is Zhuang Chengzong. Artists Tao Jin, Gu Eryi, Sun Shiyi, Wang Weiyi, Liao Bingxiong, and industrialist Wu Huaiting also came with the delegation.

A spokesperson for the delegation told reporters that their trip has three meanings: First, it is a victorious meeting of Hong Kong and Kowloon compatriots with the people of the motherland. They want to bring the feelings of Hong Kong and Kowloon compatriots who love the motherland back to Guangzhou during this trip, and bring the love of the people of Guangzhou for Hong Kong and Kowloon compatriots back to Hong Kong, so as to strengthen the unity between Hong Kong and Kowloon compatriots and the people of the mainland. Second, they want to bring the concrete facts of Guangzhou after liberation—the substance of freedom and democracy—back to Hong Kong to tell Hong Kong and Kowloon compatriots, in order to shatter the reactionary propaganda and their conspiracies to alienate Hong Kong and Kowloon compatriots. Third, through this patriotic movement, they want to consolidate and develop the revolutionary united front and expand the great unity of Hong Kong and Kowloon compatriots and foreign compatriots.

Zhang Zhennan, the head of the sightseeing delegation, said in response to the welcome from representatives of all sectors: "We Hong Kong compatriots love the motherland and yearn for its prosperity and strength. Now, the People's Republic of China has been born, the Central People's Government has been established, and Guangzhou has been liberated. We are joyfully returning to the free land of the motherland. First of all, we want to pay tribute to Chairman Mao, the savior of the people, to the Communist Party of China, which leads the Chinese people's revolution, to the heroic People's Liberation Army, and to the generals and revolutionary soldiers and civilians who liberated Guangzhou." Zhang Zhennan said: "We, the people of Hong Kong and Kowloon, are very excited about the liberation of the motherland. Since the People's Republic of China and the Central People's Government were proclaimed in Beijing, the next day, our workers, women, youth, cultural, and educational compatriots in Hong Kong held a grand celebration meeting and launched a widespread movement to comfort the troops.

In Hong Kong, we have heard many good stories about the People's Government and the People's Liberation Army. Everyone knows that the People's Government is a government that benefits the people, a truly democratic government, a truly revolutionary government, a government that makes the country prosperous and the people happy; everyone also knows that the People's Liberation Army is heroic and good at fighting, strictly disciplined, protects the people, and defends the country. The People's Government and the People's Liberation Army have a far-reaching reputation, and the compatriots living in Hong Kong and Kowloon regard it as supreme glory. We unanimously support the Central People's Government, the People's Liberation Army, Chairman Mao, and the Communist Party of China. Today we return to the liberated land for sightseeing, we want to learn from our compatriots in the motherland and follow their example. We must contribute our own strength to the construction of the new China, we must support the People's Liberation Army to eliminate the reactionaries and consolidate national defense, and we must support the motherland's economic and cultural construction and develop industry and commerce. We are all willing to serve the people and work hard for the construction of the motherland.
