Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 13th. According to reports from Hong Kong: A Macao compatriots' comfort delegation, consisting of over 400 people from all walks of life, went to Qian Shan on the 8th to extend their regards to the People's Liberation Army stationed there. The entire delegation rode in six trucks, each displaying the five-star national flag and comfort banners on their roofs. They passed through the city center of Macao, chanting slogans such as "Unite all Macao compatriots!" "Support the People's Liberation Army!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the People's Republic of China!" The people along the way applauded and cheered, set off firecrackers, and sang the national anthem, with unprecedented enthusiasm. When the trucks reached the Senado Square, they were unreasonably interfered with by the Portuguese police, who demanded that the national flag be lowered before they could pass. The leader of the delegation argued on the basis of reason, while the entire delegation shouted slogans such as "Down with imperialism!" "Macao compatriots unite!" "Long live the People's Republic of China!" "Long live the Chinese Communist Party!" Their powerful voices resounded through the clouds. The surrounding people were also filled with righteous indignation and responded in unison. At this time, the Portuguese soldiers even more barbarously wielded whips to beat the compatriots, and the Portuguese police drew their guns to intimidate them, but they were all met with strong opposition from the entire delegation and the surrounding masses. After the delegation's solemn representations, the comfort team finally won victory and marched forward singing triumphantly. After leaving the border gate, the delegation, with excitement and joy, met the People's Liberation Army on the soil of the motherland. Representatives from various units presented their letters of appreciation and gifts to their own army.

    战胜葡警干涉高歌前进
    澳门同胞赴前山劳军
    【新华社广州十三日电】据香港报载：澳门同胞组成四百余人的各界慰劳队，于八日前往慰劳驻守前山的人民解放军。该队全体分乘卡车六辆，车顶分插五星国旗及劳军旗帜，通过澳门市区，沿途高呼：“全澳同胞联合起来！”“拥护人民解放军！”“毛主席万岁！”“中华人民共和国万岁！”等口号。沿途人民鼓掌欢呼，放燃鞭炮并高唱国歌，情绪空前热烈。卡车至议事亭前，竟遭葡警察无理干涉，提出将国旗降下方许通行。领队人乃据理力争，同时该队全体队员亦高呼：“打倒帝国主义！”“澳门同胞团结起来！”“中华人民共和国万岁！”“中国共产党万岁！”等口号，声势豪壮，响彻云霄。围观人民也群情激愤，齐起响应。此时葡兵竟更横蛮挥动皮鞭殴击同胞，葡警并拔枪恐吓，但均遭到该队全体队员和周围的群众的强烈反对。经该队严正交涉下，劳军队伍终获胜利高歌前进。车出关闸外，该队以激奋而愉快的心情，在祖国土地上会见了人民解放军。各单位代表当将慰劳信及慰劳品等一一献给了自己的军队。
