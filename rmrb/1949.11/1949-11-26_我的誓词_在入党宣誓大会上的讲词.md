　　My Oath
  　Speech at the Party Admission Oath Ceremony
    He Shouhuan, Third Grade, Affiliated Girls' High School of Beijing Normal University
    I have been receiving the education of the Communist Party since I began to study. In these years of study, the Party has always pointed out the correct path forward for me, telling me for whom to study and for whom to work in the future. It made me understand, even in elementary school, that studying was for serving the people in the future. Especially in terms of class consciousness, I recognized my own family and ideologically drew a line with the landlord class. I remember when I first left home, I was afraid that people would say I came from a landlord family. I was afraid that people would know I was the daughter of a landlord, that they would dislike me for being backward, and that they would not want to get close to me, which generated a purely emotional hatred for my family. Later, I gradually realized that family background should not affect my personal progress. As long as I am willing to work hard, able to break away from the original class, and stand on the side of the proletariat, I can also progress with everyone. So when the land in my family was equally distributed, I didn't feel anything bad about it. I knew that the land was returning to the peasants, which was right, and I hated their past sins as much as the peasants did. Under the education of the Party and the help of comrades, I overcame many non-proletarian thoughts brought from home, such as: concern for face, vanity, and lack of boldness in work.

    Without the Chinese Communist Party's leadership of the Chinese people's revolution, there would be no victory today, and there would be no question of personal study at all. Therefore, I urgently request to live a strict organizational life of the Party, continue to transform myself under the direct education of the Party, and follow the Communist Party to fight to the end for the most ideal communist society. That is why I want to join the Communist Party of China.

    Since I joined this organization, it has given me a constant source of encouragement. When I encounter difficulties in study and work, I think that I am a Communist Party member, and a Communist Party member should not be afraid of difficulties. When doing everything, I also think that I am a Communist Party member, and a Communist Party member should play a backbone and exemplary role everywhere. Although I have made some progress before and after joining the Party, it is still not enough. In the future, I must study harder and help each other in school. I must humbly learn from others what I don't know, and sincerely help others with what I know. I must actively respond to and complete all the school's calls and tasks, strictly abide by Party discipline, and resolutely implement the Party's decisions. If the interests of the Party and personal interests conflict, I must give up personal interests and unconditionally obey the interests of the Party. I am willing to accept the Party's strict test during the probationary period, and I am willing to bravely accept all the tasks the Party gives me at any time. After leaving school, I will honestly work for the Party and strive to build my country.

　　我的誓词
  　在入党宣誓大会上的讲词
    师大女附中、初中三年级  贺寿銮
    从开始学习就受着共产党的教育，在这几年的学习中，党随时随地指给我前进的正确道路，告诉我为谁学习，将来为谁工作。使我在小学的时候就知道学习是为的将来为人民服务，尤其在阶级觉悟上，认识了自己的家庭，从思想上与地主阶级划清了界线。我记得在刚一离开家的时候，就怕有人说我是地主家庭出身，恐怕人家知道了我是地主的女儿，嫌我落后，不愿接近我，因而产生了单纯从感情上对家庭的恨。后来我慢慢的认识到家庭成份是不能影响我个人的进步的，只要我自己肯努力，能够脱离原来的阶级，站到无产阶级方面，我也同样的能和大家一起进步的。所以当我家里的土地被平分的时候，我一点也不觉得有什么不好，我知道这是土地回老家，是应该的，我和农民一样的痛恨他们过去的罪恶事实。在党的教育和同志们的帮助下，克服了许多从家里带来的非无产阶级思想，如：爱面子，虚荣心，工作不大胆等。
    没有中国共产党领导的中国人民革命，不会有今天的胜利，根本谈不到个人的学习问题。因此我迫切的要求过党的严格的组织生活，在党的直接教育下继续改造自己，跟着共产党为最理想的共产主义社会奋斗到底。所以我要加入中国共产党。
    我自从加入了这个组织以后，它处处给我一种激励的力量，当我在学习与工作中遇到困难的时候，便会想到自己是个共产党员，共产党员不应该怕困难。在做每一件事情的时候，也会想着我是个共产党员，共产党员应该处处起骨干作用，模范作用。我虽然在入党前后有些进步，但还作的很不够，今后在学校里更要努力学习，互相帮助。自己不会的虚心的向别人学习，自己知道的要诚恳的帮助别人，积极的响应并完成学校的一切号召与任务，严守党纪，坚决执行党的决议，如遇到党的利益与个人利益发生冲突时，一定放弃个人利益，无条件的服从党的利益，愿在后补期内接受党的严格的考验，无论什么时候都能够勇敢地接受党给我的一切任务，出校后老老实实的为党工作，努力的建设自己的国家。
