　　Strengthening Urban-Rural Material Exchange
　　Baoding Holds Industrial and Agricultural Products Exhibition
    [Baoding News] To promote industrial and agricultural development and strengthen urban-rural material exchange, the Baoding Industrial and Agricultural Products Exhibition officially opened on the 15th of this month. A total of 1,288 industrial and agricultural products participated in the exhibition. The conference also invited 57 representatives from farmers and business circles from more than ten counties and towns near Baoding City, including Gaoyang, Laishui, Yi County, Ding County, Anguo, and Botou Town, to visit and exchange opinions on urban-rural material exchange. After the opening of the exhibition, farmers from the four rural areas, two or thirty miles away from Baoding City, automatically rushed to visit, reaching about 10,000 people on the first day.
    In order to widely exchange opinions on urban-rural material exchange, the exhibition held a forum on the 17th for farmer representatives from various counties and towns who came to Baoding to visit, as well as representatives from public and private enterprise departments in the city. At the meeting, the farmer representatives put forward many suggestions for improving the exhibited industrial products. The representative from Botou Town said: "The axle of the waterwheel can be drilled, not cast, because the cast ones are not durable. The waterwheel bucket should be made larger to irrigate more land." The exhibition is scheduled for seven days and it was decided that representatives from various places would take turns to visit various factories in Baoding City and hold group discussions by region to specifically study the issue of urban-rural material exchange.

　　加强城乡物资交流
　　保定举行工农产品展览
    【保定讯】为促进工、农业发展，加强城乡物资交流，保定市工农业产品展览会，于本月十五日正式开幕。参加展览的共有工、农产品一千二百八十八件。该会并邀请了保市附近高阳、涞水、易县、定县、安国、泊头镇等十余县、镇农民及工商界代表五十七人前往参观和交换城乡物资交流意见。展览会开幕后，距保定城二、三十里地的四乡农民自动赶来参观的，第一日即达万人左右。
    展览会为广泛的交换对城乡物资交流的意见，十七日举行各县镇来保参观农民代表及本市公私营企业部门代表座谈会。会上各农民代表对展览的工业品提出了很多改进意见。泊镇的代表说：“水车轴的眼可以钻，不能铸，因为铸的不耐久。水车斗子应改大，能多浇地。”展览会预计七日，并决定各地代表轮流参观保市各工厂，按地区分组座谈，具体研究城乡物资交流问题。
