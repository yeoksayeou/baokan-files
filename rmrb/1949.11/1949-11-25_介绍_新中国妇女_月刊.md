    The "New China Women" monthly magazine was launched on July 20th this year and has now published five issues.

    Over the past four months, the "New China Women" monthly magazine has played a significant role in women's work. Some female cadres said: "The 'New China Women' monthly magazine has been a great help to our work, especially Comrade Cai Chang's articles, which have helped us even more, solving many difficult problems we encountered in our work, and we are following what she said to do." Some readers also said: "After reading the article 'I Improved After Group Criticism' in the third issue of 'New China Women,' I was greatly educated and helped me overcome many arrogant shortcomings."

    The "New China Women" monthly magazine also cooperated with the current needs of women's work, pointing out what Chinese women urgently need to do at present; at the same time, it introduced readers to political, economic, scientific, and other knowledge, reported and reflected the initial experience of women's work in New China, as well as the ideological changes and living conditions of women from all walks of life. It also provided the basic theory of women's issues, introduced common knowledge of maternal and child health, and women's and children's welfare undertakings, etc.

    However, due to the short publication date of the "New China Women" monthly magazine, the tasks that should be undertaken in the editorial work have not been fully completed. There is still a considerable distance between it and the requirements of the broad masses of women and the expectations of readers, and it still has several obvious shortcomings: First, the reports on the initial experience of urban women's work or the situation of women's work in new areas are still insufficient, and it has not well completed the task of exchanging the experience and lessons of women's work in various regions. Second, it has not been able to conduct more in-depth research and discussion and solve the various specific problems existing in the women's movement in a timely manner. Third, some articles are too long or not popular enough. Fourth, the introduction of materials related to maternal and child health and women's and children's welfare undertakings is still very little.

    The articles in the fourth and fifth issues are more popular than before, there are fewer articles that are too long, and a "Mass Garden" column has been opened up for beginners in writing, making it possible to absorb wider and more correspondents and readers.

    We hope that the "New China Women" monthly magazine will make more efforts in this direction!

　　介绍“新中国妇女”月刊
　　何哉
    “新中国妇女”月刊，是今年七月二十号创刊的，现在已经出版了五期。
    四个月来，“新中国妇女”月刊，在妇女工作上是起了相当作用的。有的女干部说：“新中国妇女月刊对我们的工作帮助很大，特别是蔡畅同志的文章，给我们的帮助更大，解决了我们在工作里所遇到的不少困难问题，我们也正在按照她所讲的去做。”还有的读者说：“我看了新中国妇女第三期上‘小组批评后我进步了’这篇文章以后，对我的教育很大，帮助我克服了许多自高自大的缺点。”
    “新中国妇女”月刊还配合了当前妇女工作的需要，指出了中国妇女在目前所迫切要做的事情；同时，向读者介绍了政治、经济、科学等知识，报导和反映了新中国妇女工作的初步经验，以及各阶层妇女的思想转变、生活情况等。它还提供了妇女问题的基本理论，介绍了妇婴卫生常识和妇女儿童福利事业等等。
    但是，由于“新中国妇女”月刊出版的日期很短、在编辑工作上应担负起来的任务，还没有能全部做好。它和广大妇女群众的要求，读者的希望，还有一个相当的距离，它还存着几个很明显的缺点：第一、关于城市妇女工作的初步经验，或者新区妇女工作情况的报导方面还显得不够，没有很好地完成交流各地区妇女工作经验教训的任务。第二、没有能够更深入地展开研究讨论并且及时地解决妇女运动当中所存在的各种具体问题。第三、有些文章太长或者不够通俗。第四、有关妇婴卫生、妇女儿童福利事业的材料介绍得还很少。
    第四、五期的文章都比以前通俗了，太长的文章也少了，并给初学写作的人开辟了“大众园地”一栏，使它可能吸收更广更多的通讯员和读者。
    我们希望“新中国妇女”月刊向着这一方向更多的努力！
