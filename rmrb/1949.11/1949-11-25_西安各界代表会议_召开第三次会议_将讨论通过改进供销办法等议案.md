Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 24th. The third meeting of the Xi'an People's Representatives Conference was held from the 21st to the 22nd. The central topics of the meeting were the effective supply of goods to citizens and the cultural, educational, and construction plans for the next six months. The meeting discussed and approved several proposals put forward by the Municipal Trading Company regarding improving supply and marketing methods, as well as proposals related to culture, education, civil affairs, health, production, and employment. The improved supply and marketing methods stipulate that workers, poor laborers, public employees and teachers with financial difficulties, and families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers in Xi'an will have priority purchasing rights. This method improves upon the past shortcomings where speculators banded together to snap up goods, while legitimate consumers were left empty-handed.

　　将讨论通过改进供销办法等议案
    【新华社西安二十四日电】西安市各界代表会议第三次会议，已于二十一日至二十二日召开。会议的中心议题为市民的有效供应问题及今后半年的文教建设计划。会上讨论并通过了市贸易公司提出的改进供销办法和有关文教、民政、卫生、生产、就业等议案多件。改进供销办法规定凡西安市工人、贫苦劳动人民、生活困难的公教人员及烈军工属将获得优先购买权。这个办法改善了过去投机商人结伙抢购、正当消费者反而向隅的缺点。
