　　[Beijing News] The Beijing Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau, in order to implement the resolutions of the All-Circles Representative Conference, conducted a comprehensive verification of household registrations in Beijing during August and September. This clarified the chaotic state of Beijing's household registrations and initially established a new household registration system. A more accurate population count for the entire city was also obtained. As of November 1st, the city had a total of 439,998 households, with a population of 1,957,424. This is a decrease of 25,003 households and 345,464 people compared to before liberation. The decrease in population is mainly due to landlords, merchants, students, scattered Kuomintang soldiers, and puppet administrative personnel who came here from the Northeast, Northwest, and smaller cities in North China during the war. After liberation, these people returned to their hometowns, schools, or were sent back home.

　　This household registration verification has a significant impact on the municipal administration, industry, culture, education, sanitation construction, taxation, transportation, and other work of the people's capital. It initially clarified that employed citizens account for 768,145 of the city's population, and there are 200,640 school-age children between the ages of six and twelve. In September, there were 5,276 births, 408 deaths, and 956 marriages in the city. The average daily flow of people entering and leaving Beijing was over 25,800. In addition, it greatly assisted in the city's public security work. Through this household registration verification, a total of 175 unregistered Kuomintang secret agents, 92 reactionary party and group members above the district level, 1,508 scattered Kuomintang soldiers, and 764 key members of secret societies and Daoist sects were identified. Five illegal radio stations and 44 rifles and pistols were seized. Furthermore, in the process of verification, 2,174 cases of unreported households and 3,933 cases of inconsistent household registrations were discovered and promptly educated and corrected.

　　Before the start of this household registration verification, the Municipal Public Security Bureau first formulated an implementation plan. Each sub-bureau, based on the instructions of the Municipal Bureau and the specific conditions of its district, formulated detailed implementation methods, conducted universal education and mobilization among cadres and police officers, announced the work plan, implementation methods, and work rules, and called on former police officers to stand firm, serve the people, and perform meritorious service in their work. Some sub-bureaus also established reward and punishment measures. At the same time, propaganda and mobilization were carried out among the masses by convening neighborhood head meetings, mass meetings, household head meetings, shop assistant meetings, employee representative meetings, and hotel meetings. Some sub-bureaus also used schools and literacy classes to explain the significance of the household registration verification work.

　　During the verification work, each sub-bureau, under the unified leadership of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, established a household registration verification committee or command group to grasp the overall situation in its jurisdiction, solve problems in the liberation work, and handle cases. Some sub-bureaus also organized mobile groups to conduct targeted verification. A total of 3,481 people from various sub-bureaus and relevant units such as the Disciplinary Corps participated in the work. Due to the different conditions in the areas under the jurisdiction of each sub-bureau, the steps and methods adopted during the verification varied slightly, but the combination of positive verification and lateral investigation, along with the in-depth mobilization of the masses to assist, yielded significant results. Cadres and police officers were amiable, strictly disciplined, and conscientious in their attitude during this verification work, which was generally praised by the masses, and strengthened the relationship between the people's police and the masses. Many people said: "In the past, when checking household registrations, they would not check the homes of wealthy people after being treated with cigarettes, tea, and snacks. They would rummage through boxes and cabinets in the homes of poor people, scold them, and beat them, trying to find trouble with good people and extort money. The police are really better now, and we dare to say anything."

　　Through this household registration verification work, the necessary materials for urban construction and the initial experience in urban management were obtained. The police management system used by the Kuomintang reactionaries to rule the people was abolished, and a dedicated household registration system was established. The household registration books were changed from a three-part system to a one-part system, and the household registration books of the Municipal Public Security Bureau and various sub-bureaus were abolished, retaining only the household registration books of the police stations. It is also planned to remove many unnecessary and cumbersome procedures, which will provide great convenience to the broad masses. The household registration agency was also changed from a two-tier system to a one-tier system, abolishing the household registration agency of the Civil Affairs Bureau and unifying it under the Public Security Bureau. In addition, the old forms and statistical systems were abolished, and a reporting system of daily, ten-day, monthly, and quarterly reports was established to grasp the overall household registration situation. In this work, there were also some shortcomings and biases. Individual sub-bureaus, due to their eagerness to achieve success, were sloppy in their work. Some inserted other work halfway, diverting their energy, forming a phenomenon of being tight at first and then loose. Some did not carry out sufficient publicity and mobilization of the masses, so they could not fully utilize the strength of the masses to assist in the work. Some individuals still thought that the household registration verification was too troublesome, so they could not discover more problems. But overall, the success was greater than the shortcomings.

　　京完成户口查对建立新户籍制度
  　全市人口共一九五万余人
    【北京讯】北京市人民政府公安局为执行各界代表会议的决议，在八、九两个月中，对京市户口进行了全面的查对工作，澄清了京市户口上的混乱现象，初步建立了新的户口制度；对全市人口亦有了较正确的统计。至十一月一日止，全市共有四十三万九千九百九十八户，一百九十五万七千四百二十四人。较解放前减少二万五千零三户，三十四万五千四百六十四人。减少的人口，主要是在战争期间从东北、西北与华北各中小城市到此的地主、商人、学生以及国民党流散军人、伪行政人员等，这些人在解放后纷纷还乡、返校以及被遣送回家。
    此次户口查对，对人民首都的市政、工业、文化、教育、卫生建设及税收、交通等工作，都有相当大的作用，初步查清了在全市人口中，有职业的市民占七十六万八千一百四十五人，六岁至十二岁的学龄儿童二十万零六百四十人。在九月份中，全市出生五千二百七十六人，死亡四百零八人，婚嫁九百五十六人，每日出入北京市境的流动人口平均在二万五千八百余人。此外，对本市的治安工作，更获很大帮助，经过这次户口查对，共查出未登记的国民党特务分子一百七十五名，反动党团区级以上者九十二名，国民党流散军人一千五百零八名，重要帮会道门分子七百六十四名。查获非法电台五部，长短枪四十四支。此外在查对工作中发现漏报户口及户口不符者二千一百七十四件，三千九百三十三人，均及时予以教育纠正。
    市公安局在此次户口查对开始之前，首先拟定了实施计划，各分局又根据市局指示及本区具体情况，拟出实施详细办法，在干部员警中，进行了普遍的教育动员，宣布工作计划、实施办法及工作守则，并号召旧警人员站稳立场为人民服务，在工作中立功，有些分局还订立了奖惩办法。同时，在群众中分别召开闾长会、群众会、户主会、店员会、职工代表会和旅店会进行宣传动员，有的分局并通过学校及识字班讲解查对户口工作的意义。
    在查对工作中，各分局在市公安局统一领导下，均专设户口查对委员会或指挥组，以掌握该管区内全面情况，解放工作中的问题并处理案件。有些分局还组织机动小组，作有重点的查对。各分局及纠察总队等有关单位，共动员了三千四百八十一人参加工作。因各分局所辖地区之情况不同，所以在查对时，采取之步骤和方法亦略有差别，而以正面查对和侧面调查相结合，同时深入发动群众协助，收获颇大。干部与警察在此次查对工作中，态度和谒、严守纪律、办事认真，普遍博得群众赞扬，密切了人民警察与群众的关系，许多人都说：“过去查户口，到有钱人家，烟茶点心一招待就不查了；到穷人家翻箱倒柜，开口就骂，伸手就打，想办法在好人身上找麻烦，勒索财物。现在的警察真是变好了，我们有什么话也敢讲了。”
    经过了此次户口查对工作，取得了建设城市所必需的材料，和管理城市的初步经验。废除了国民党反动派统治人民的警管制度，建立了户籍专任制；户口簿册由三部制改为一部制，取消市公安局和各分局的户口册，只保留派出所的一份户口册；并计划即将去掉许多不必要的繁琐手续；这将给广大群众以极大的方便。户籍机构，也由二元化改为一元化，取消民政局户籍机构，而统一于公安局。此外并废除了旧的表格和统计制度，建立了日报、旬报、月报、季报等报告制度，以掌握全面户口情况。此次工作中，也存在一些缺点与偏向，个别分局由于急于求功而工作草率，有的半路插入其他工作而分散了力量，形成先紧后松现象。有的对群众宣传动员不够深入，致不能充分发挥群众力量，协助工作。个别群众还认为查对户口太麻烦，以致不能发现更多的问题。但整个说来，成功大而缺点少。
