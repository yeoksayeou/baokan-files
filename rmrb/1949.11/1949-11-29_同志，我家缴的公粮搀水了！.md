"Comrade, the public grain my family handed in is watered down!"
    Cheng Lixing
    At dinner time, Uncle Wang walked in with a grin, and handed Dad a piece of paper under the dim oil lamp, saying that the village had assigned our family's share of public grain. I looked at Dad's face, he frowned, and didn't say a word for a long time.
    Uncle Wang was usually talkative. Since he was selected as the village representative to attend a meeting in the county, he had become even more talkative. He would tell everyone he met, "Now we have democracy. Us farmers can sit in the front row at meetings in the county. The county magistrate and other cadres personally talked to us. At the end, they even treated us to a performance of Liu Hulan. That play was really good." As he spoke, his eyebrows danced with excitement. He would randomly grab one of the children surrounding him and rub his gray, long beard on the child's face, which was very ticklish. Finally, he would laugh heartily, his laughter mixed with a sound like an owl's call.
    Today, Uncle Wang saw Dad's expression and restrained his laughter, not saying much. He just sat on the threshold and smoked.
    Mom was quick-witted and broke the silence, "The public grain has been assigned? How much does our family have to provide?" "Not much, it's written on the paper," Uncle Wang stood up, took the paper Dad was holding again in the lamplight, bent down, and almost put his beard on the flame, "Twenty-two jin of public grain per mu, five jin of local grain, a total of twenty-seven jin; your family has eleven mu and two fen of land, after deducting taxes for people and cattle, haha, you only have to give less than two hundred and ten jin! I say, Lao San, we've all turned over, and we've all received land. It's nothing to give a little for the country...."
    After Uncle Wang left, Dad muttered to himself, rolling his bloodshot eyes from hard labor. Sometimes he glared fiercely at Mom, and sometimes he glared fiercely at me. I knew that when he showed us such a look, he was looking for our faults. If anyone did anything he didn't like, or made a small mistake, he would scold us like a sudden storm with heavy rain, slamming the table and throwing bowls. Therefore, I quickly and quietly climbed onto the kang, hiding in the shadows, watching Mom carefully washing the pots and bowls.
    Mom also remained silent, the lamplight reflecting her yellow face covered with messy hair, and she also sighed deeply.
    "Why are you so pessimistic?" I thought to myself, I knew Dad's temper, but I didn't dare to say anything: "If you have land and don't want to hand in public grain, what will the soldiers at the front eat!" I remembered that when school was dismissed today, the teacher repeatedly told us to mobilize our parents to respond to the call from above, to hand in quickly, hand in completely, and hand in good grain, leaving no arrears! I don't think this work can be done, so I was also very unhappy. Thinking, thinking, I curled up and fell asleep in the corner of the kang.
    I felt very cold. I woke up groggily. The oil lamp was still lit in the room. Dad hadn't slept, and Mom hadn't slept either. They were whispering, not knowing what they were talking about. Behind Mom was a large cloth bag full of grain. She squatted in front of the stove, scooping things out of the pot full of water with a ladle, the clear sound of water dripping. Dad bent over, took the things Mom scooped out, and spread them on the mat laid on the ground. He was very mysterious, neither angry nor smiling, with sweat lightly floating on his dark forehead.
    I took a peek, ah, it was millet, wet yellow millet with water!
    I couldn't sleep anymore, my mind wandered, and I didn't dare to make a sound. But I thought, if the teacher asks me again, "Who is the most backward?" I will definitely answer: "Dad and Mom."
    The next day, Dad's cough woke me up. I don't know when I was stuffed next to Mom. Dad put on his clothes and was putting on his shoes. I said, "Dad, when are we going to hand in the public grain? The teacher told us to mobilize yesterday!"
    Dad pulled a long face and rolled his bloodshot eyes at me, saying, "Children, mind your own business!" Finally, his face became even fiercer. I lowered my eyelids and didn't dare to look at him again, only his voice roughly and urgently drilled into my ears: "Say less nonsense to outsiders, hand in the public grain, do you need to mobilize me? I'll hand it in this afternoon!"
    He put on the manure basket, coughed twice outside the door, and went to collect manure.
    Humph, I have a good idea in my stomach, wait and see! The teacher often tells me that the People's Liberation Army is freezing and starving at the front, we have turned over, and have been divided land and houses, how can we hand in this kind of watered-down bad public grain? I don't agree with what Dad and Mom are doing.
    In the afternoon, I quickly finished my meal and ran to the front of the village office. A group of people were surrounding the withered locust tree at the door, each carrying a cloth bag and pouring the grain into the funnel of the winnowing machine. Uncle Wang was operating the winnowing machine. Don't look at his drooping gray beard, he was full of energy when he fanned it. The grain poured down like yellow water, and a cloud of dust and bran rose from the front opening of the winnowing machine, falling on Uncle Wang's head, back, and beard; falling on the head of Aunt Niannian, who was using a dustpan to load the winnowed grain into the bag, her head wrapped in a snow-white towel, but the snow-white towel had turned yellow.
    Monkey's dad held the scale, the bran and soil sticking to his face, making him look like a ghost, grinning with two rows of snow-white teeth, calling Xiangfa to carry the grain. His tone was always like a hoarse donkey, the more anxious, the coarser his voice.
    They were laughing, shouting, moving their hands to weigh the grain, a chaotic scene.
    From afar, Dad pushed a wooden-wheeled cart, also coming to hand in the public grain. I hid in the corner, watching him unload two bags of grain, stop on the side of the winnowing machine, talking with Uncle Wang, he was not angry, nor did he frown all night like last night, I saw he was very peaceful, but his smile was forced.
    Xiangfa poured Dad's grain into the winnowing machine, and Uncle Wang fanned it again with a swaying motion.
    "How clean, no chaff or dirt!" Uncle Wang laughed.
    "Really good, the rice grains are round and plump!"
    "First share, Liu San's rice!" Aunt Niannian also commented, as she put it into the bag, she urged Monkey's dad to weigh it.
    Dad also laughed, helping to tie the mouth of the bag containing the winnowed rice, laying the two bags side by side, tying them with rope, picking up a wooden pole with Xiangfa and carrying the rice over the scale.
    I felt myself trembling in the corner, I had never been so angry, but my tears seemed to burst out of my eyes, my heart was beating, both ashamed and angry, as if my whole body was full of strength, I ran over, forcibly pushing Xiangfa away.
    Monkey's Dad stretched his neck again, trembling with a hoarse donkey-like tone: "Write it down - Liu San's rice - including the skin - two hundred and eighteen -"
    I stepped forward and grabbed the scale bar, I felt like I had almost become a madman, shouting, yelling: "Comrades, don't accept this public grain! The public grain my family handed in is watered down!"
    Everyone was stunned for a moment, then suddenly started to move, untying the bags, Uncle Wang grabbed a handful of rice and brought it close to his nose to inspect, Aunt Niannian put the rice in her mouth to taste. After a while, they surrounded Dad, shouting and yelling.
    Dad was originally tall, like a telephone pole, but at this time I saw him gradually shrinking, bending his waist, lowering his head, his neck showing a purplish-brown color from the darkness...
    "Carry it away, go exchange it!"
    "Carry it away, quickly bring good rice, you this...!"
    I ran to the school in one breath, I was victorious, I had overcome Dad's backwardness, my heart was very light and happy. The teacher had already started the class, seeing me walk into the classroom with my chest out, he only said faintly: "Why are you so late?" and continued his talk, telling us how to mobilize the masses to quickly hand in public grain.
    I jumped onto my seat, not in the mood to listen to the lecture, my mind was confused, thinking about how to comfort and encourage my backward dad after school.

### “同志，我家缴的公粮搀水了！”

　　“同志，我家缴的公粮搀水了！”
    程力行
    吃晚饭的时候，王伯伯笑嘻嘻地跨进门来，在昏黯的油灯下递给了爸爸一张纸条，说是村里给我家分配了公粮的份数，我望了一下爸爸的脸，他皱起了眉头，半天，没说一句话。
    王伯伯本来是爱说话的，自从他被选作村里的代表到县上开会回来以后，他的话更多了，逢人便宣传：“现在实行民主了，咱这个庄稼汉，在县里开会，也坐上席，县长和什么干部都亲自和咱谈话，临了，还招待咱看了一出刘胡兰，那个戏真好。”他说时，眉飞色舞，随手抱过我们围绕他的一群孩子中的一个，用他那灰而长的胡须向抱的孩子的脸蛋上磨擦，怪痒痒的。最后，他哈哈地笑了，咳嗽中夹杂了象夜猫子叫的笑声。
    今天，王伯伯看到了爸爸的脸色，收敛了他的笑声，也没多说一句话，只是坐在了门槛上吸烟。
    还是妈妈机警，打破了沉默的空气：“派公粮了？我家掏多少？”“不多，上面写着，”王伯伯站起来，在灯光下又把爸爸手里拿着的纸条要过来，弯下身子，几乎把胡须放上了灯火：“每亩公粮二十二斤，地方粮五斤，共二十七斤；你家是十一亩二分地，除去人，牛的免税，哈哈，拿的还不到二百一十斤呢！我说老三，咱们都翻了身了，又都领了地，为国家，拿点子算不了什么……。”
    王伯伯走了以后，爸爸嘟嘟哝浓地，翻起了他那因劳苦生产而充满了血丝的眼球，有时狠狠的瞪妈妈，也有时狠狠的瞪我。我知道，当他向我们一显出这样的眼光时，是在找寻我们的差错，谁有一点让他瞧不顺眼，或是做错了一件小事情，他便会用象一阵夹有急雨的暴风，拍案摔碗地骂到我们头上来，因此，我赶快不声不响地爬上了炕，躲在暗影里，看妈小心翼翼地洗刷锅碗。
    妈也沉默着，灯影里，乱发掩盖了她的黄脸，也叹着长气。
    “怎么，你们这么想不开？”我心里想，我摸清爸爸的脾气，可就没敢说出声来：“有地不肯拿公粮，前方的兵吃什么呀！”我想到今天放学时，老师再三地嘱咐我们，让我们动员自己的爸爸妈妈，要响应上级的号召，快缴、全缴、缴好粮食，不留尾欠！这个工作，我看是做不到了，所以我也很不高兴，想着，想着，我也就蜷屈了身子，倒在炕角睡着了。
    身上很冷，矇胧醒来，屋子里仍旧点着油灯，爸没睡，妈也没睡，他们唧唧哝哝地不知在说些什么，妈的身后停着一大布袋满装的粮食，她蹲在灶前一笊篱一笊篱从盛满水的锅里往外捞东西，漏着清脆的水声。爸弯曲了身子，接过妈妈捞出的东西在铺在地上的席上摊着，他很神秘，不恼也不笑，黝黑的额上轻浮着汗滴。
    我偷偷地一看，啊，是小米，带水的湿的黄色的小米！
    我再也睡不着了，心里胡思乱想，也不敢出声。但是我想，如果老师再问我：“谁最落后？”我一定答复：“爸爸和妈妈。”
    第二天，爸爸的咳嗽声惊醒了我，我不知什么时候被塞在妈的身边的。爸穿了衣服在登鞋子，我说：“爸爸，咱什么时候交公粮呢？昨天老师让我们动员呢！”
    爸拉长了脸子，向我翻动着他那血丝糊着的眼说：“孩子家，少管闲事！”最后，他的脸色更凶狠了，我拉下眼皮，不敢再看他一眼，只有他的声音粗暴而急促地向我的耳朵里乱钻：“对外少说闲话，缴公粮，也要你动员？我午后就缴！”
    他背上粪筐，在门外咳嗽了两声，拾粪去了。
    哼，我肚里有数，回来看！老师时常和我讲，解放军受冻受饿在前方打仗，我们翻了身，分了地和房，怎么缴这种搀水的坏公粮呢？我不赞成爸爸和妈妈做的这事。
    午后，我很快的吃罢了饭，跑到村公所的门前，一群的人在门口的枯槐树上围绕着，一个个的扛了布袋把粮食倒在扇车的漏斗里，搅动扇车的是王伯伯，别看他搭拉着灰的长胡须，扇动起来可满带劲头儿呢。粮食象黄水一般的泻下来，从扇车的前口扬起了一片土和米糠的雾，落在王伯伯的头上、背上、胡须上；落在一簸箕一簸箕把扇好的粮食装向口袋的年年的妈的头上，她的头上包了一块雪白的手巾，但是雪白的手巾已变成黄色了。
    猴的爸爸扶着秤，米糠和土把他的脸粘成了个鬼脸，龇裂着两排雪白的牙齿，喊叫祥发扛粮食。他的声调老是哑驴似的，越着急，嗓门也越粗。
    他们笑着、喊着，动着手秤粮食，乱成了一片。
    远远地爸爸推了辆木轮车，也来缴公粮来了。我躲在拐角里，看他把两口袋粮食卸下来，停在扇车的一边，搭＠着和王伯伯说着话，他不恼怒，也不象昨天晚上那样皱了一夜的眉头，我看他倒很安详，不过笑容是勉强的。
    祥发把爸爸的粮食注进扇车，王伯伯又一仰一优地扇动起来。
    “多么干净啊，没有糠也没有土！”王伯伯笑了。
    “真好，米粒又圆又饱满！”
    “头一份儿，刘三家的米！”年年的妈也品评着，她一面往布袋里装一面催猴的爸爸过秤。
    爸爸也笑，帮着把装入口袋的过风米捆住口，两袋顺躺在一块，系上绳子，拿起根木扛同祥发把米扛起来过秤。
    我觉得我站在拐角里发抖，我从来没有这样恼怒过，但我的眼泪好象从眼里迸出来了，我的心跳动了，又羞愧又恼怒，仿佛全身都充满了力量，我跑过去，用力挤开祥发。
    猴的爸又伸长了脖子，颤动着哑驴似的调子：“写一笔——刘三的米——连皮——二百一十八——”
    我上前扒住了秤杆，我觉得自己几乎成了一个疯子，喊着，嚷着：“同志，不要收这分公粮！我家缴的公粮搀了水了！”
    大家怔了一下，忽然乱纷纷地动起了手，把口袋解开，王伯伯抓起了一把米凑近了鼻孔审视，年年的妈把米送到嘴里品尝着。一会儿，他们把爸爸围拢了，嚷着乱着。
    爸爸本来身材高大，象一根电线杆子，这时我看他渐渐矮下去，弯了腰，低了头，脖子从黑黝中透出了紫酱色……。
    “扛走，换去！”
    “扛走，快拿好米去，你这……！”
    我一口气跑到学校里，我胜利了，战胜了爸爸的落后，心上非常轻松愉快。老师已经上了课，看见我挺了胸脯走进教室，他只淡淡地说了一句：“怎么来的这么晚？”仍继续他的谈话，告诉我们怎样发动群众赶快缴公粮。
    我跳上自己的坐位，没心听讲，心思乱了，在想，如何在放学后安慰劝勉我那落后的爸爸。
