　　Guangzhou Military Control Commission Trade Department
  　Temporarily Manages Import and Export Matters
    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 19th. In order to promote the exchange of materials between inside and outside, and to encourage the export of local products and the import of necessary goods, the Guangzhou Military Control Commission has decided that before the Central People's Government announces foreign trade management regulations and the South China Trade Bureau is established, the Trade Department of the Commission will temporarily handle import and export management and the application matters of import and export merchants. The department began accepting applications from import and export merchants on the 16th. For the time being, imports are limited to those with their own foreign exchange, and must be materials, raw materials, and various necessities that are beneficial to economic construction and the national economy and people's livelihood. In terms of exports, it is stipulated that before the settlement method is announced, exporters can first handle exports with guarantees from merchants or commercial banks that the government deems credible, and then complete the settlement of exchange later.
