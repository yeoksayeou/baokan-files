　　【Beijing News】The Shijingshan Power Plant, which had neglected necessary safety equipment, has now made preliminary improvements. In terms of electrical safety, iron railings have been added around the sprinkler pump distribution panels and in front of the cement partitions of the No. 3, 4, and 5 generator switches to prevent workers from electric shock. At the same time, the oil level gauges on the transformers were often blackened and difficult to see. If the oil level drops, it can easily cause transformer failure, which has now attracted attention. In terms of boilers, ash pushers in the past were inevitably burned by the splashing coal ash. Now, water pipes have been added to the ash hoppers to spray water and wet the cinders to avoid burns. However, some work is difficult to correct immediately due to a lack of materials. For example, acetylene welders still place oxygen-burning calcium carbide barrels indoors, which is very dangerous to workers in the event of an explosion. Some boilers lack necessary temperature gauges, airflow meters, water flow meters, coal measuring meters and other tools, making it impossible to accurately grasp the condition of the boilers. These shortcomings, which have always been considered minor details, insignificant, and focusing solely on power generation while neglecting work safety, are now being gradually corrected. A comprehensive inspection of all departments in the plant has recently been carried out, and a comprehensive plan has been formulated to thoroughly improve the situation.

　　石景山发电厂改进安全设备
    【北京讯】石景山发电厂忽视必要的安全设备，现已初步改进。电气方面，已在喷水器水泵配电在盘四周和三、四、五号发电机开关洋灰隔子前面加设铁栏杆，以免职工触电。同时变压器的油标常乌黑看不清楚，万一油面降低，易使变压器发生故障，现已引起注意。锅炉方面，推灰工人过去因煤灰四射难免烧伤皮肤，现落灰斗加水管喷水，用水浇湿焦子，避免烧伤。但有些工作限于缺少器材尚难立即纠正，如汽焊工人把烧氧气的电石桶仍放在室内，万一爆炸对工人很危险。部分锅炉缺少必要的温度表、气流表、水流表、量煤表等工具，不能精确掌握锅炉情况。这些一向被认为是小节、无足重轻，只求单纯发电不顾工作安全的缺点，现正逐渐纠正，日前已进行了一次全厂各部门普遍检查，并订出全盘计划，着手彻底改进。
