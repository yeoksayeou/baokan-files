The conference held a warm discussion on the report of the Secretary-General of the Standing Committee, Laffargue. Representatives from various countries unanimously condemned the war-mongering and war-preparation conspiracies carried out by the US-British imperialists and their lackeys around the world in their speeches, and especially exposed the conspiracies of the Tito clique. The representatives reflected the heroic struggles and firm determination of the people of various countries to defend peace, and at the same time, emphasized the importance of further consolidating and expanding the peace camp. The conference decided to establish a permanent secretariat for the Standing Committee and elected the following new members to the Standing Committee: Volgin Nesmeyanov (Soviet Union); Johannes R. Becher, Bernhard Goering (Germany); Garaudy (France); Mustafa Amin (Syria). The conference also elected Kodinova Spurna (Czechoslovakia) as Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee.

The concluding general resolution of the Standing Committee was also unanimously adopted at the meeting.
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 2nd: TASS, Rome: At the closing session of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress on October 31, a resolution was passed to expel the representatives of the Tito clique. The full text of the resolution is as follows: In the declaration of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress, we pointed out the Tito's and his accomplices' policies hostile to the cause of peace. We declared that the current Yugoslav government has become a tool of imperialism - warmongers. For this reason, we severed relations with the "Yugoslav Peace Committee" headed by Menderovic and Vidmar. They actively support Tito's policy of betraying the cause of peace. It must be pointed out that this decision of ours is by no means directed at the Yugoslav people. We deeply know that the vast majority of the Yugoslav people are against war and against Tito's war policy. Therefore, we abandon the representatives of the Yugoslav warmongers and extend our fraternal respect directly to the Yugoslav peace advocates. The Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress specifically reserves their place for the representatives of the Yugoslav people who are striving for freedom and world peace.

　　和大常委二届全会闭幕
  　选新委员参加常委会并成立常设书记处
    决议将铁托集团代表开除出和大常委会
    【新华社北京二日电】据塔斯社罗马讯：世界拥护和平大会常设委员会第二届全体会议，已于十月三十一日在罗马闭幕。大会曾对常委会总书记拉斐德的报告进行了热烈的讨论。各国代表在发言时均一致抨击美英帝国主义者及其走卒在世界各地所进行的煽动战争及准备战争的阴谋活动，并特别揭露铁托集团的阴谋。代表们反映了各国人民保卫和平的英勇斗争及坚强的决心，同时，并强调了进一步巩固和扩大和平阵营的重要性。大会决定成立常委会的常设书记处，并选举了下列新委员参加常委会：沃尔金·涅斯米扬诺夫（苏联）；约翰尼斯海契尔，柏纳德·哥灵（德国）；茄朗第（法国）；穆斯塔法·阿明（叙利亚）。大会又新选科丁诺瓦·斯普尔纳（捷克斯洛伐克）为常设委员会副主席。大会并一致通过决议：将铁托集团的代表开除出和大常委会。常设委员会的总结性的总决议案，也在会议上获得一致通过。
    【新华社北京二日电】塔斯社罗马讯：世界拥护和平大会常设委员会在十月三十一日的闭幕大会上，通过开除铁托集团代表的决议，决议全文如下：在世界拥护和平大会常设委员会的宣言中，我们指出了铁托及其帮凶们敌视和平事业的政策。我们宣告，南斯拉夫现政府业已变成帝国主义——战争贩子的工具。因为这个理由，我们和以明德罗维奇与维德马尔为首的“南斯拉夫拥护和平委员会”断绝关系。他们积极拥护铁托背叛和平事业的政策。必须指出，我们这个决定绝不是对南斯拉夫人民而发的。我们深知，绝大多数的南斯拉夫人民都反对战争，反对铁托的战争政策，因此，我们丢弃了南斯拉夫战争贩子的代表，直接向南斯拉夫的和平拥护者致兄弟的敬意。世界拥护和平大会常设委员会，特别为那些争取自由和争取世界和平的南斯拉夫人民的代表们，保留他们的位置。
