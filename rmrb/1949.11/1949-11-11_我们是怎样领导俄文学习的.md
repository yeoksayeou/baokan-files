How We Led Russian Language Learning

    A month ago, our class – the 8th Russian Language Team of China University – was formed upon order. We have now learned ten lessons. Generally, we can speak, write, translate, and use everything we have learned. According to our teacher – an old Russian professor – this is a very good achievement. In addition to the efforts of teachers and students, some necessary steps taken in organization and leadership are also a reason. Now I would like to talk about some of our preliminary experiences in organization and leadership.

  I.  Give Play to Mass Enthusiasm and Create Learning Methods.

    At first, we only roughly stipulated in the learning process that there should be previewing before class, reviewing after class, and reading newspapers at night. However, we couldn't provide the groups with more opinions on how to preview and how to review. At this time, we found that the first group immediately gathered together after class to correct the pronunciation of newly learned words and then proceeded to mutually recall grammatical points. At the same time, we also found that the third group tested themselves every morning before previewing and stipulated that mutual aid groups would give each other questions and conduct small quizzes on Saturdays. We thought these methods were good and happily promoted them. Later, the experience of the first group became the prelude to the mutual aid group review after each class; and the experience of the third group laid the foundation for brewing exams in the whole class.

    Then we discovered some problems with the mutual aid groups; some mutual aid groups did not carry out activities very much; some activities were excessive; some had too many people, and attention was not concentrated enough. After research by the group leader's liaison meeting, improvement suggestions were put forward. Later, the mutual aid groups generally found a more appropriate time for assisting learning groups to carry out activities, that is, each study began and ended, and the learning groups concentrated on activities. Under normal circumstances, the mutual aid groups carried out activities, and the number of people in each mutual aid group proved to be two to three people.

    The arrangement of the learning environment created by the fifth group attracted our attention. They wrote the Russian words they had learned on the surrounding objects, helping them to remember what they saw. They also used the new words learned every day to compile the names of the group members, calling them out from time to time in order to become familiar with them. This method was good, and everyone liked it. Later, various Russian games and pronunciation competitions were created.

    Later, we took several exams. The exams made us realize some problems. At first, we didn't know how to ask questions, how to read the papers, or how to score them. We went to seek the opinions of the research group (composed of people in the class who were making good progress in learning). Based on their opinions, we collected the questions that each group tested each other on weekdays, selected the questions of medium difficulty, and sorted out the test questions for the whole class. These test questions were appropriate in depth. The papers were exchanged and evaluated by the groups (that is, democratic evaluation). However, after two exams, it was found that the scoring standards of the groups were inconsistent. After research, we learned how to score according to the medium level of the answer sheets.

    In short, we paid attention to every new invention in learning, affirmed it and promoted it in a timely manner. In this way, our Russian learning methods became more and more numerous.

  II.  Grasp Political Leadership to Ensure Russian Language Learning.

    Now, every day when the sky is just dawning, our students begin a day of tense and joyful learning. But the initial learning mood was not entirely like this. At the beginning, the students were just transferred from the political class. Although they realized that this study was a political task, some people accepted it with a simple "task point of view," and some comrades carried the burden of "cadre" and did not have a very strong desire to learn. In addition, at the beginning of the class, we had not made systematic arrangements for political study (the school stipulated that in addition to mainly conducting Russian language study, the Russian class should also conduct regular political study, and the proportion of Russian language classes and political classes was six to one), and some comrades were not enthusiastic about political study. Because political study was not good enough, ideological problems were not solved, and Russian language learning could not be improved. The students did not care about each other, everyone was thinking about their own problems, and a cloud of harmony and tiredness permeated the class.

    Clarifying this problem, with the help of the higher-ups, we grasped political leadership, solved ideological obstacles to learning, and ensured Russian language learning.

    We reported the situation to the responsible comrades at all levels and asked them to make reports; we also arranged for the study of the article "The Sense of New Things is the Precious Quality of Bolsheviks"; and combined with documents, we conducted ideological self-criticism. We considered the content of the entire political study, opposed the simple "task point of view," and advocated studying with a revolutionary spirit.

    The fourth group seriously solved its own learning ideological problems in this process and made a leap forward. A certain comrade in the fourth group who had fallen behind no longer bowed his head and hid aside, but ran back to the group very strongly, asking loudly and reciting loudly. The whole group was no longer scattered and weak in learning, but was very united, happy, and collectively creative. In the third test, the total average score of the fourth group was 86 points, rising to the first in the class.

    In this way, all the students quickly set off a learning upsurge.

  III.  Establish an Examination System Through Competitions.

    Due to the continuous improvement of learning enthusiasm, students and students launched competitions. Subsequently, competitions also unfolded between groups and groups. The goals that everyone strove for in learning gradually became clear, requiring: "We must learn Russian well, and we must not ignore politics," "Russian must be able to do four things – speak, write, translate, and use," "Create new methods to help everyone progress," and strictly abide by work and rest times, adhere to the system, unite, and be happy. Therefore, the trade union (because the students in our class were originally cadres, a trade union branch was still organized) issued a competition call and specifically organized the Russian language learning competition. The class administration enthusiastically supported this competition until it was successfully summarized after two weeks. In the competition, we opposed the academic-style learning attitude of "only holding Russian, and ignoring everything else," and also opposed the "purely business viewpoint" that political and business cannot be unified, or overemphasizing politics and not learning Russian. We corrected the slack phenomenon and also prevented individual overwork and recklessism without a little rest, so that everyone could guarantee to learn where they went and be able to do it. In the test after the competition, the total average score of the class was over 80 points, which was more than 20 points higher than the total average of 67 points for the class in the test two weeks ago.

    In the summary, we clearly recognized the importance of establishing a regular examination system.

    At first, we were not so clear about this issue, and everyone emphasized "self-consciousness" (because our school has always rarely recorded scores and exams), but facts have proved that exams have a considerable effect on promoting learning. Through it, we praised and consolidated the good, and also criticized and helped the insufficient. Based on this experience, we have stipulated that there will be small tests (once every two weeks) and monthly tests in the future. In addition, the groups can also test each other on topics. We use exams as the final form of our review. Through exams, we summarize teaching effects and teaching methods as a basis for future improvements.

### 我们是怎样领导俄文学习的

    我们是怎样领导俄文学习的
    一个月前，我们这个班——华大俄文队第八班，奉命组成。现在已经学了十课，凡是学过的，一般可以作到会说、会写、会译、会用。据我们的教员——一位老俄文教授说，这个成绩很不坏。这除了教员与学员的努力外，组织领导上采取了一些必要的步骤，也不能不是原因之一。现在就想谈一谈我们组织领导的一些初步经验。
  一  发挥群众积极性，创造学习方法。
    起初，我们在学习进程上，只粗略的规定有课前作预习，课后作复习，晚上看报纸，而究竟怎样进行预习，怎样进行复习，却没法给小组提供更多意见。这时我们发现第一组在下课后，立刻凑在一起，纠正新学单字的发音，并进而互相追记文法重点。同时又发现第三组每早预习前自己考试一下，并且规定礼拜六互助小组间互相出题，作小测验。我们觉得这些办法好，就很欣悦的将它们推广了。以后，一组的经验就成为全班每次听课后以互助小组进行复习前的前奏；而三组的经验，则给以后酝酿全班范围的考试，打下基础。
    接着我们发现互助小组上的一些问题；有的互助组不怎么进行活动；有的活动又过多；有的人数较多，注意力不够集中。经过组长联系会研究，提出改进意见，以后，互助组一般找到了辅助学习小组进行活动的较恰当时机，即每一次学习开始和结束，学习小组集中活动，一般情况下则是互助小组活动，而每个互助组的人数，则证明了二至三人为宜。
    五组创造的布置学习环境，引起了我们的注意。他们把学过的俄文，都写在有关的周围物品上，目之所触，帮助记忆。并用每天学过的生字编作组员名字，时常点叫，以求熟习。这个方法不错，大家都喜欢它，以后就更创造出各种俄文游戏和发音比赛来。
    后来我们作了几次考试。考试中，又使我们体会了一些问题。起初，我们是不知道怎么出题目的，也不知道怎么看卷子和评分数。我们就去征求研究组（由班上学习进度较好的人组成）的意见。根据他们的意见，把平日各组互相测验的题目搜集起来，挑选出中等程度的整理出全班性的试题。这种试题，深浅适宜。卷子则由小组交换评定（即民主评卷）。可是在两次考试后，又发现小组评分标准不一致，经过研究，学会了按答卷的中等水准进行评分的办法。
    总之，我们是注意了每一件学习中的新发明，肯定和及时推广它。就这样，我们的俄文学习办法越来越多。
  二  抓紧政治领导，保证俄文学习。
    现在，每天天刚亮，我们的学员，就紧张愉快的开始一天的学习了。可是最初的学习情绪不完全是如此的。开始，学员刚由政治班转调来此，虽然认识到这次学习是一个政治任务，但有人是用单纯的“任务观点”接受的，还有部分同志背着“干部”包袱，没有十分强烈的学习愿望。加上开班初期我们对政治学习尚未作系统布置（学校规定，俄文班除主要进行俄文学习外，并作经常的政治学习，而俄文课和政治课的比重是六比一），部分同志对政治学习情绪也不高。由于政治学习不够好，思想问题没解决，俄文学习也不能再提高。同学间互不关心，各人想着各人的问题，班上漫迷着一团和气与疲蹋的空气。
    明确了这一问题，在上级的帮助下，我们抓紧政治领导，解决学习思想障碍，保证俄文学习。
    我们把情况反映给各级负责同志，请他们作报告；又布置了“对新鲜事物的感觉是布尔什维克的宝贵品质”一文的学习；并结合文件，进行思想检讨，我们考虑了整个政治学习的内容，反对单纯“任务观点”，提倡用革命的精神进行学习。
    第四组就在这一过程中认真解决了自己的学习思想问题，而飞跃往前迈进。四组中原已落后的某同志，不再低头躲在一旁，而十分强健的跑回小组中，大声询问，大声背诵了。全组也不再是分散的学习力不强的，而是非常团结、愉快、有集体创造性的了。第三次测验中，四组全组的总平均分数是八十六分，升到全班第一。
    就是这样，全体学员很快就掀起学习热潮。
  三  通过竞赛，建立考试制度。
    由于学习情绪的不断提高，学员和学员之间，发起了竞赛。继之，小组和小组之间也展开了竞赛。大家在学习上争取的目标渐渐明确起来，要求：“一定把俄文学好，也不忽略政治”，“俄文要作到四会——说、写、译、用”，“创造新办法，帮助大家进步”，并且严守作息时间，坚持制度，团结，愉快。于是工会（因我班学员原来都是干部，故仍组织了工会支部）提出竞赛号召，具体组织俄文学习竞赛。班行政热情支持这一竞赛，直到进行两个礼拜后，胜利总结。竞赛中，我们反对了“专抱俄文，其余不管”的学院式学习态度，也反对了政治、业务不能统一的“单纯业务观点”或过分强调政治，不学俄文。纠正了松懈现象，也阻止了个别的过度用功，不稍休息的拚命主义，使大家保证学到那里，会到那里。竞赛后的测验，全班总平均分数为八十分强，较两星期前测验，全班总平均六十七分，提高二十多分。
    总结中，我们认清楚了建立起经常考试制度的重要性。
    起初，我们对这一问题并不这么明确，大家强调“自觉”（因我校过去一直很少记分考试），但事实证明，考试对于推动学习有相当作用。通过它，我们表扬和巩固了好的，也批评和帮助了不够的。根据这一经验我们规定了今后小考（每两星期一次）和月考，此外，小组还可互出题目测验。用考试作我们复习的最终形式。通过考试，我们总结教学效果和教学方法，以为今后改进的根据。
