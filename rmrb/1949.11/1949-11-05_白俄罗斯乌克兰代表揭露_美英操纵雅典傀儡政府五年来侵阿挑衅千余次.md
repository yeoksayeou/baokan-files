　　The October 28th meeting showed that the US and British delegations were trying to make the discussion of the Greek question favorable to them, but they failed. Therefore, they engaged in divisive activities, trying to lead the Political Committee away from the correct path in resolving the Greek question. The so-called proposal suddenly put forward by British representative McNair at the end of the meeting was significant in this regard. He said that three "observers" were shot at on October 25th from Albanian territory. McNair proposed that the committee immediately demand that the Albanian government cease these "attacks." Ukrainian representative Manuilsky protested the British representative's request, saying: This hastily concocted proposal has an evil smell, and its purpose is to slander the Albanian government.

　　McNair insisted on a vote on the British proposal, but the chairman of the Political Committee refused to put it to a vote immediately.

　　At the October 29th meeting, McNair again insisted on an immediate vote on his proposal, and was supported by US representative Cohen and Chilean representative Aranha.

　　Soviet representative Malik vehemently opposed the demands of the US and British representatives. The Soviet delegation believes that the Political Committee should carefully examine the British proposal and study the materials mentioned by McNair in his proposal. Apart from the US, British, and Chilean representatives, no one supported the British proposal, so McNair had to withdraw it. The Chilean representative then put forward McNair's suggestion in his own name and immediately put it to a vote. Twenty-six delegations voted against it, and only four countries, including Chile itself, voted in favor, while nineteen delegations abstained.

　　Thus, the committee returned to the discussion of the Greek question. Belarusian representative Kiselev pointed out in his speech that the Athens rulers, obeying their US and British masters, pursued a policy hostile to Albania and Bulgaria, made aggressive demands on territories bordering Greece, and provoked endless border incidents to create an artificial political tension. The Athens government is deliberately unwilling to resolve the issue peacefully and violates the basic principles of the UN Charter and threatens international peace and security with its hostile and aggressive policies towards Albania and Bulgaria. Kiselev cited a number of facts, and specifically cited an editorial entitled "March on the Albanian Capital" published in the royalist fascist newspaper "Ethnikos Kirix" on April 6, 1949, as proof of the aforementioned facts. This article openly wrote that Greece must "occupy Albania and crush everything in it. And this must be done immediately. There can be no waiting." This is the concrete manifestation of the so-called "love of peace" of the Greek government, which is trying to ignite the flames of war in the Balkans. The Belarusian representative then cited many examples of the royalist fascist army, navy, and air force violating Albanian borders. From November 1944 to the beginning of October 1949 alone, the armed forces of the Athens government had carried out 1,565 armed provocations against Albanian territory. Obviously, the policy of the Athens government, which organized such large-scale aggressive and criminal military operations, violates international law and the principles of the UN Charter and is aimed at provoking a new war. However, the Balkan Mediation Committee remained silent about the reports of Greek troops attacking the Albanian border. They are doing everything possible to slander Albania in order to focus world opinion on this non-existent fabricated issue. He called on the representatives of the Political Committee to vote in favor of the Soviet proposal.

　　Ukrainian Republic representative Manuilsky also gave a long speech. Following Manuilsky, US representative Cohen said that Manuilsky's speech and the statements of some people's democratic countries clearly showed that the Soviet Union was unwilling to peacefully resolve the Greek question. Soviet representative Malik strongly refuted this attack. Malik said: "The American representative's words are not in accordance with reality. I participated in the work of the Mediation Committee, and the members of the Mediation Committee told me that it was not them who opposed the Soviet Union's proposal for a peaceful solution to the Greek question, and it was not the committee that put forward another plan for the Greek question, but the Greek delegation supported by the US and Britain. This suggestion from the Greek delegation blatantly showed the attitude of the Greek royalist fascist government, which made predatory demands on Albania. This is the reason and the root of the crime why the Mediation Committee cannot resolve Greek-Albanian relations. The US and British delegations opposed the Soviet proposal. The United States and Britain are unwilling to resolve the Greek issue peacefully. They are willing to ignite the flames of hatred and mutual suspicion between Greece and other countries in the Balkans. They want to obtain a legitimate basis to stick their noses into the affairs of Greece and the Balkans. The entire process of the Mediation Committee's work, its reports, documents, and the positions of the US, British, and Greek delegations, all illustrate that the delegations of these countries are hindering all methods aimed at resolving the Greek issue." Malik finally pointed out that if the US delegation, which shelters the Greek royalist fascist regime and directs the Greek delegation, advises this Greek greedy person who covets other people's property to stop their predatory desires for Albania and abandon their illegal demands for Albania's territorial integrity and independence, then the problem of relations between Greece and the countries concerned will be easily resolved.

　　The Political Committee meeting on October 29 concluded at this point.

### 白俄罗斯乌克兰代表揭露　美英操纵雅典傀儡政府五年来侵阿挑衅千余次

　　白俄罗斯乌克兰代表揭露
  　美英操纵雅典傀儡政府五年来侵阿挑衅千余次
    十月二十八日的会议，表明美英代表团力谋使希腊问题的讨论有利于他们，但是失败了。因此，他们又从事挑拨活动，想使政治委员会在解决希腊问题上离开正确的道路。英国代表麦克奈尔在会议将告结束时忽然提出的所谓提案，其意义正在于此。他说什么三名“观察员”于十月二十五日遭到发自阿尔巴尼亚领土的射击。麦克奈尔提议委员会立即要求阿尔巴尼亚政府终止这些“袭击”。乌克兰代表曼努意斯基抗议英国代表这种要求，他说：这种急急忙忙泡制起来的提案，发出邪恶的味道，其目的在于污蔑阿尔巴尼亚政府。
    麦克奈尔坚持表决英国提案，但政治委员会主席拒绝立即付诸表决。
    在十月二十九日的会议上，麦克奈尔再度坚持立即表决他的提案，并受到美国代表柯亨和智利代表阿兰台兹的支持。
    苏联代表马立克猛烈反对美国和英国代表的要求。苏联代表团认为：政治委员会应详细审查英国的提案，研究麦克奈尔在其提案中所提到的那些材料。除了美、英、智利代表之外，谁也不支持英国的建议，麦克奈尔便只好撤回它。智利代表却以自己的名义来提出麦克奈尔的建议，当即付诸表决。二十六个代表团投票反对，连智利自己在内也只有四国投票赞成，十九个代表团弃权。
    于是，委员会便回到希腊问题的讨论上去。白俄罗斯代表基塞列夫在他的发言中指出：服从其美英主子的雅典统治者，实行敌对阿尔巴尼亚和保加利亚的政策，对毗连希腊边境的领土提出侵略性的要求，挑起无休止的边境事件，以制造人为的政治紧张局面。雅典政府存心不要和平解决问题，并且以其敌视和侵略政策对付阿尔巴尼亚与保加利亚，这就违反联合国宪章的基本原则，并威胁国际和平与安全。基塞列夫援引了若干事实，并且特别援引了保皇法西斯报纸“艾特尼可斯·基利克斯”一九四九年四月六日刊登的“向阿尔巴尼亚首都进军”的一篇社论，作为上述事实的确证。这篇文章公开地写道：希腊必须“进占阿尔巴尼亚，把它的一切都粉碎干净。而且这必须立刻就做。不能有一刻的等待”。这就是力图煸起巴尔干战争大火的希腊政府所谓“爱好和平”的具体表现。白俄罗斯代表继而援引保皇法西斯的陆海空军侵犯阿尔巴尼亚疆界的许多例子。这仅仅自一九四四年十一月到一九四九年十月初，雅典政府的武装部队就已进行一千五百六十五次对阿尔巴尼亚领土的武装挑衅。显然，组织如此大规模的侵略和罪恶的军事行动的雅典政府的政策，乃是违犯国际法与联合国宪章的原则，而且旨在挑起新的战争。然而，巴尔干调解委员会对希腊军队进攻阿尔巴尼亚边疆的报告，却一声不响。他们却正在尽一切可能诽谤阿尔巴尼亚，因为要极力吸引世界舆论注意这个并不存在的捏造的问题。他号召政治委员会的代表们投票赞同苏联的提案。
    乌克兰共和国代表曼努意斯基也作了长篇演讲。继曼努意斯基之后发言的是美国代表柯亨，他说，曼努意斯基的发言以及某些人民民主国家代表们的声明，都确实地表明苏联不愿意希腊问题的和平解决。苏联代表马立克对这一攻击予以坚决的反击。马立克说：“美国代表这种话是不符合实际的。我曾参加调解委员会的工作，调解委员会的委员告诉我，反对和平解决希腊问题之苏联建议的并不是他们，提出希腊问题另一个方案的也不是委员会，而是在美英支持下的希腊代表团。希腊代表团的这种建议，露骨地显示出向阿尔巴尼亚提出掠夺性要求的希腊保皇法西斯政府的态度。这就是调解委员会不能解决希阿关系的原因和罪恶的根源所在。美英代表团反对苏联的提案。美国和英国不愿意以和平方式解决希腊问题。他们愿意在巴尔干燃起希腊与其他国家之间仇恨和互相猜疑的火焰来。他们要获得合法的根据，来把自己的鼻子伸到希腊和巴尔干的事情里去。调解委员会工作的整个过程，它的报告、文件以及美国、英国和希腊代表团的立场，这一切都说明了这些国家的代表团阻挠旨在解决希腊问题的一切办法。”马立克最后指出，如果庇护着希腊保皇法西斯政权并指使着希腊代表团活动的美国代表团，劝告这个贪图别人财产的希腊贪婪之徒停止他们对阿尔巴尼亚掠夺性的欲望，并放弃对阿尔巴尼亚领土完整与独立之非法要求，那末，希腊与有关各国的关系问题就容易解决了。
    十月二十九日的政治委员会会议至此结束。
