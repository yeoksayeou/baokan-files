[Report from this newspaper]

　　In this autumn's harvest and wheat planting, various regions of Hebei Province have mobilized broad masses of women to actively participate in field production. For example, in Xinle County, Dingxian Special District, women participating in field production account for 90 percent. In Wuji County, among the 34,624 women with full labor capacity, 85 percent participated in field production. In Jianguo County, Cangxian Special District, among the 18,738 women who could participate in production in the tenth district, 13,088 participated in field production this autumn, breaking historical records. In Neiqiu County, Xingtai Special District, out of the county's 53,389 women, 42,710 participated in the autumn harvest movement.

　　This large female army on the production front participates in harvesting crops, preparing the land, pulling plows to sow wheat, and various other tasks, just like men. In 29 villages in the second district of Boye County, over 7,600 women harvested over 10,800 mu of millet and cut over 6,120 mu of sorghum this autumn. Women in disaster areas are actively engaged in cutting grass and collecting wild vegetables to save resources and prepare for famine, in response to the call for production for self-salvation.

　　In order to overcome the shortage of manpower and animal power and improve production efficiency, women in various regions, under the leadership of women's federations at all levels, have widely organized mutual aid in production. According to incomplete statistics from 76 villages in 16 districts of Raoyang, Boye, and Shenze counties alone, 4,250 young and middle-aged women have organized 863 mutual aid groups. In six districts of Xinle County, 2,060 young and middle-aged women and 3,306 men have jointly organized 1,261 mutual aid groups. The fourth district organized eight elderly women's baby-holding teams to take care of children for young and middle-aged women, freeing them up to go to the fields for production.
