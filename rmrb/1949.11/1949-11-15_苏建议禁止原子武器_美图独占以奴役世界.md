    The USSR Proposes Banning Atomic Weapons;
    US Seeks Monopoly to Enslave the World
    Malik said: These two extremely opposite positions on the atomic issue reflect two opposing diplomatic policies. The Soviet policy is to defend and strengthen peace and security, reduce armaments, and promote cooperation among nations. On the other hand, the policy of the American ruling clique is an arms race and preparation for a new war. In line with this approach on the atomic energy issue, the American and British ruling cliques are attempting to establish an all-powerful monopoly trust controlled by the United States under the official banner of the United Nations, handing over all atomic raw materials and raw material processing plants to this agency. They want to grant this trust the exclusive right to explore and exploit atomic raw materials in any other country, while keeping the entire US atomic energy industry outside international control for the entire duration. Therefore, the American ruling clique hopes to gain full opportunity to continue to utilize atomic energy for military purposes without regulation or limitation, to manufacture atomic weapons, and to stockpile and retain them. They harbor the illusion of the United States monopolizing atomic weapons, hoping to use the fact of producing and stockpiling atomic weapons as a means of exerting military pressure on other countries in order to enslave them economically and politically.

    Malik pointed out: The atomic energy control plan supported by the US government actually means establishing American monopoly control not only over atomic energy and related enterprises, but also over the entire economic life of other countries, which would inevitably lead to these countries losing national sovereignty and being dragged into groups pursuing aggressive aims. Supporters of this plan are trying to circumvent the principle of unanimity among the five permanent members of the Security Council stipulated by the United Nations Charter. They seek to establish the same relationship between the planned atomic trust and the United Nations as exists between the United States' primary monopoly capital and state institutions. However, such a claim would in fact lead to the destruction of the United Nations and turn the Security Council into a subsidiary body of this American trust.

    Malik declared: Based on its position on the atomic issue, the Soviet government has in the past, and will in the future, continue to strive to prohibit the use of atomic energy for military purposes, to stop the production of atomic weapons, and to establish strict international control to supervise the implementation of this prohibition by all countries.

    Malik continued, the US and British governments, proceeding from their aim of avoiding a ban on atomic weapons, have systematically obstructed with all kinds of conspiracies in the past, and will continue to obstruct in the future, the adoption of the Soviet proposal to ban atomic weapons. The followers of the US-British bloc are trying their best to establish control before atomic weapons are banned. They use this method to make control ineffective. At the same time, the representatives of this bloc rack their brains to come up with a kind of control that would allow the American espionage agencies to collect military intelligence. This kind of control certainly cannot be accepted. The reaction of the United States and Britain to the Soviet proposal submitted to the Third Session of the United Nations General Assembly is nothing but a refusal to ban atomic weapons. The Soviet proposal calls for the simultaneous conclusion and implementation of two conventions: one convention on the prohibition of atomic weapons and the other on the control of atomic energy. This fact must not be obscured. The fact is that the representatives of the United States and Britain have undermined the resolution of the United Nations General Assembly of January 24, 1946, on the establishment of the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission, have brought the Atomic Energy Commission to an impasse, and have in fact already abolished it.

    苏建议禁止原子武器
    美图独占以奴役世界
    马立克说：在原子问题上这两种极端相反的立场，反映了两种对立的外交政策。苏联的政策是保卫和加强和平与安全、裁减军备及各国人民间合作的政策。另一方面，美国统治集团的政策，是军备竞赛和准备新战争的政策。美英统治集团在原子能问题上，按照这种方针，力图在联合国的正式招牌下设立美国控制的具有无上权力的独占托拉斯，把所有的原子原料和原料加工的工厂，都交给这个机构。他们想给这个托拉斯以在任何其它国家探测和开采原子原料的独占权，同时在这样长的整个期间，却把美国的全部原子能工业，置于国际管制之外。因此，美国统治集团期望获得充分机会，继续无管制地无限制地为军事目的利用原子能，制造原子武器，并积存和保留之。他们抱着美国独占原子武器的幻想，期望利用生产和积存原子武器这一事实，作为对其他国家施用以军事压力的手段，以便在经济上和政治上奴役它们。
    马立克指出：美国政府所支持的原子能管制计划，实际上意味着不仅是对原子及有关企业，而且是对其他国家的整个经济生活，建立美国的独占控制权，这就不可避免地使这些国家丧失国家主权并被拉入追逐侵略目的的集团。这个计划的支持者企图骗过联合国宪章所规定的安理会中五常任理事国一致的原则，他们力求在计划的原子托拉斯与联合国之间，按照美国的首要独占资本与国家机构之间的关系类型，建立同样的关系。但是，这种主张实际上将导向破坏联合国，并把安理会变成这一美国托拉斯的附属机关。
    马立克声明：苏联政府根据它对原子问题的立场，过去、而且将来仍然力求禁止为军事目的而使用原子能，停止原子武器的生产，并建立严格的国际管制，以监督各个国家执行这一禁令。
    马立克继续说，美英政府由于从其避免禁止原子武器的目的出发，它们过去有系统地用一切阴谋诡计阻碍了、而且将来还继续阻碍采纳苏联之禁止原子武器的建议。美英集团的附从者，竭力想在原子武器被禁止之前，先建立管制。他们用这种办法来使管制成为无效力的。同时，这个集团的代表们用尽心机想出一种能听任美国谍报机关收集军事情报的管制。这种管制当然不能被接受。美国和英国对于苏联向联合国大会第三届会议所提出的建议的反应，不是别的，而是拒绝禁用原子武器。苏联的建议要求同时订立和实行两个公约：一个公约是关于禁用原子武器，另一个公约是关于原子能管制。这个事实决不能被蒙蔽过去。这个事实就是：美国和英国代表破坏联合国大会一九四六年一月二十四日关于成立联合国原子能委员会的决议，已经使原子能委员会陷于绝境，并且实际上已经把它取消。
