[Report from this newspaper] Thanks to the concerted efforts of the Party, government, military, and people in Xingtai County, coupled with timely rainfall, significant achievements were made in agricultural production this year. The annual grain output increased by 143,419 shi. The task of "one inch more production," as called for by Chairman Mao, has been basically completed. This spring, the CPC County Committee of the county proposed to strive for an increase of 21,000 shi of coarse grains in agricultural production, and guided farmers to plant large quantities of cotton, hemp, and other crops, calling on farmers to cultivate deeply and apply more fertilizer, and develop water conservancy. As farmers’ enthusiasm for production generally soared after being liberated, most of the county’s land was cultivated twice, and the amount of fertilizer applied in semi-old areas was generally one to one and a half cartloads. The technology for managing cotton fields has gradually improved, with an average increase of 10 to 20 jin of seed cotton per mu compared to last year. The average yield of cotton per mu in the county was 82.5 jin. As a result of water conservancy construction, the area of paddy fields increased by 18,166 mu compared to last year. From the perspective of leadership, the main factors in achieving these achievements were grasping the following key aspects: (1) Vigorously developing rural cooperation and mutual aid, overcoming past administrative orders, forced groupings, and spontaneous flows, so that truly voluntary, mutually beneficial, and unconstrained small-scale mutual aid groups were extensively developed. From the beginning of spring to weeding and autumn harvest, the proportion of households participating in mutual aid gradually increased to 80% of the total households, generally around 70%. According to statistics from 283 villages in 11 districts, a total of 39,881 households, 29,611 farmers participated in mutual aid, accounting for 75% of the total households. In leading small-scale mutual aid, on the one hand, the principle of voluntary equivalence was implemented; on the other hand, the tendency to treat mutual aid groups as administrative groups was overcome. All administrative work, such as statistical figures and tax burdens, that had been added to the mutual aid groups in the past was handled by administrative organizations; then the Party branch mobilized Party members to go to various street mutual aid groups to influence and lead the mutual aid groups with their own active production and exemplary actions. Farmers warmly supported this new leadership method. (2) The county leadership implemented the call to mobilize the vast number of women to participate in agricultural production. According to statistics from 353 villages, the number of women participating in agricultural production in the first half of the year accounted for 68% of the total number of women, and this number increased to 70% to 80% during the wheat harvest and sowing season. Women participated in everything from weeding and pulling rollers to personally holding the seed drill and planting, and going into the water to dig the ground. (3) The leadership method of combining general appeals with typical examples was used. District cadres widely adopted this method in their leadership work, which was also an important factor in the great achievements of this year's production campaign.

　　邢台农民完成“生产长一寸”任务
  　增产粮食十四万石         
    改进互助妇女参加劳动起了保证作用
    【本报讯】邢台县由于党政军民一致努力，加之雨水及时，今年在农业生产上获得重大成绩，全年增产粮食十四万三千四百十九石。基本上完成了毛主席号召的“生产长一寸”的任务，今春该县中共县委曾提出在农业生产上，为增产二万一千石粗粮而努力，并领导农民大量播种棉花、大麻等，号召农民深耕细作多施肥，发展水利。由于农民翻身后生产情绪普遍高涨，该县大部土地做到了耕二遍，半老区施肥一般的均在一车到一车半。棉田管理技术逐渐改进，一般较去年增产每亩平均籽棉十斤至二十斤，全县棉地平均每亩产棉八十二斤半。与修水利的结果，水田较去年增加一万八千一百六十六亩。这些成绩的获得从领导上检查，主要的掌握了以下环节：（一）大力发展了农村合作互助，克服了过去行政命令，强迫编组及自流现象，使真正自愿两利不拘形式的小型互助，得到了大量的发展，从开春到锄苗、秋收，逐步发展到参加互助的户数占总户数的百分之八十，一般的均在百分之七十左右。据十一个区二百八十三个村统计，共三万九千八百八十一户，参加互助的农民达二万九千六百一十一户，占总户数的百分之七十五。对小型互助的领导，一面贯彻了自愿等价的原则；一面克服了把互助组当成行政组的偏向，把过去所有加在互助组里的统计数字、征收负担等行政工作，全部由行政组织办理；再由支部发动党员到各街互助组，分头以自己的积极生产，模范行动影响领导互助组，农民对这种新的领导方法热烈拥护。（二）该县领导上贯彻了关于发动广大妇女参加农业生产的号召，据三百五十三个村统计：前半年参加农业生产的妇女，占妇女人数的百分之六十八，麦收下种时即发展至百分之七十至八十，妇女由锄苗、拉砘子，直至亲自扶耧耩种，下水刨地。（三）运用了一般号召与典型推动相结合的领导方法。区干部在领导工作中广泛的采用了这种方法，也是今年生产运动获得巨大成绩的重要因素。
