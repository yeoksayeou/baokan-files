[Our Newspaper] The All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government Administrative Council jointly hosted a banquet yesterday (the 4th) for the outbound performing arts troupe participating in the International Youth Festival. The outbound performing arts troupe's performance at the International Youth Festival was warmly welcomed by over 10,000 youth representatives from more than 70 countries. Their waist drum performance won a special prize, and Li Bo and Guo Lanying's solo performances both won individual awards. On their return journey, they performed in Moscow for the Soviet Youth League, Moscow university students, and collective farm residents. After returning to China, they accompanied the Soviet cultural, artistic, and scientific workers delegation to perform in Shanghai, Nanjing, Jinan, Beijing, and other places. They performed a total of more than 30 times at home and abroad, with an audience of hundreds of thousands of people, receiving unanimous praise from home and abroad. In addition to experiencing internationalist education, the members of the delegation had the opportunity to observe the art of various countries, especially the art of the Soviet Union. At the welcome reception, Minister of Culture Shen Yanbing gave an impromptu speech celebrating the victorious return of the outbound performing arts troupe. Li Bozhao, the head of the outbound performing arts troupe, explained that the success of the troupe's performance and the warm welcome it received at home and abroad represented the victory of Chairman Mao's literary and artistic direction and the victory of the Chinese people's revolution. During the banquet, guests and hosts frequently rose to toast Chairman Mao's health and the great victory of the People's Liberation Army. (Jin Feng)
