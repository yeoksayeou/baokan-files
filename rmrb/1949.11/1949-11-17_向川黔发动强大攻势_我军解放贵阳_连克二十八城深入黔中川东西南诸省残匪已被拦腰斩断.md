Xinhua News Agency, Southwest Front, 16th – The People's Liberation Army, having launched a powerful offensive towards Guizhou and Sichuan provinces, liberated Guiyang on the 15th. In the twelve-day offensive from the 4th to the 15th of this month, they captured twenty-eight county towns in succession. The Liberation Army has now penetrated deep into central Guizhou and reached southeastern Sichuan. The southwestern provinces, which the remnant Kuomintang bandit gangs attempted to use as a base for their last-ditch resistance, are being cut off by the Liberation Army. The Liberation Army, advancing into Guizhou, successively captured sixteen county towns in eastern and central Guizhou from the 4th to the 14th, including Tianzhu, Sansui, Yuping, Tongren, Songtao, Cengong, Zhenyuan, Shibing, Huangping, Yuqing, Lushan, Wengan, Pingyue, Majiang, Guiding, and Longli. At noon on the 15th, they liberated Guiyang in one fell swoop. The Liberation Army entering the city was warmly welcomed by the citizens. The Liberation Army, entering Sichuan from western Hunan, quickly crossed the main ridge of the Wuling Mountains bordering Sichuan, Guizhou, and Hunan. On the 7th, they captured Xiushan City, the gateway to Sichuan. On the 11th and 12th, they successively occupied Youyang, a strategic location in eastern Sichuan, and Qianjiang City. On the 14th, they captured Gongtan, an important location west of Youyang and east of the Wujiang River. At the same time, Huang County (briefly liberated by us on October 3rd but later occupied by the enemy), Qiancheng, Yongshui, Baojing, Fenghuang, Longshan in western Hunan, and Enshi, Laifeng, and Xianfeng in southwestern Hubei province were also successively liberated. In the face of the Liberation Army's powerful offensive, the bandit army's defensive lines completely collapsed, and they fled westward in disarray. In the pursuit of the fleeing enemy, we annihilated parts of the enemy's 327th Division of the 49th Army, the 249th Division, the 64th Division of the 15th Army, and the 54th Division of the 118th Army, capturing more than 2,900 enemy soldiers and seizing a large amount of weapons and ammunition. When Baojing, Yongshui, and Qiancheng were liberated, Nie Pengsheng, the Commissioner of the Eighth Administrative Region of the pseudo-Hunan Province and concurrently the Commander of the Security Forces, Long Jiao, the pseudo-County Magistrate of Yongshui, and the pseudo-County Magistrate of Qiancheng all led their troops to contact the Liberation Army to negotiate surrender.
