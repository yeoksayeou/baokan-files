    Masses in Beijing Suburbs
    Donate Railway Materials

    [Beijing News] The collection of railway transportation materials in the suburbs of this city has achieved considerable success. The Fifteenth District has now received 362 large rails, 123 small rails, 123 steel plates, 23 large awls, and 1 drilling machine; the Eighteenth District has now received more than 560 rails and more than 2,000 kilograms of scrap iron. Other districts have received some rails, steel plates, fishplates, spikes, sleepers, scrap iron, and dispatch telephones. Currently, each district is continuing to call on residents to actively support the front lines and build the people's railways by promptly and voluntarily returning railway transportation materials stored by individuals to all the people. For donated materials that were originally purchased with valid receipts, the government will pay according to the price. Those who enthusiastically collect and return railway materials with outstanding results will be awarded honorary awards or bonuses by relevant authorities.
