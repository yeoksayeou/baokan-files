　　Beijing Women's Production and Education Institute
  　Begins Political and Cultural Studies
    [Beijing News] More than 1,200 newly admitted women in the eight sections of the Beijing Women's Production and Education Institute have begun political and cultural studies. On the fifth day after they were liberated from the brothels (the 26th), their emotions had generally stabilized, and they began a regular, normal life. They get up at 7:00 in the morning. In the morning, the staff members of each section explain the stories of women's liberation and emancipation. In the afternoon, they study culture collectively, and most of them learn to read. The 108 women in the first section saved more than 80,000 yuan from their pocket money for cigarettes, etc., and bought paper and pens for study. After dinner, it is entertainment time, and everyone is enthusiastically learning new songs, and some are even beating gongs and drums and dancing the Yangko. In order to make their lives comfortable, the institute has concentrated all the beds from the brothels so that they all have beds to sleep in. Stoves have also been built in each section to provide them with cooking and boiling water. They also automatically take turns in groups to boil water and seal the stoves themselves. The belongings they used to store in the brothels have been taken back by representatives since yesterday. For those with children, they were also helped to bring the children to see them. In order to treat their illnesses as soon as possible, the medical team attached to the institute officially started a general examination and treatment yesterday (the 28th). Four women suffering from severe venereal diseases, uterine tumors, and heart disease have been sent to the hospital for treatment. In addition, the Central Maternity and Child Health Institute also sent six doctors with a small X-ray machine to help with medical work. From these facts, they have realized the sincerity of the People's Government in liberating them and expressed their gratitude to the People's Government for closing the brothels and liberating themselves.

    【北京讯】北京市妇女生产教养院八个所中的一千二百多个新生的妇女，已开始政治和文化学习。她们由妓院解放出来后的第五天（二十六日），情绪已普遍稳定下来，开始了有规律的正常生活。早晨七时起床，上午由各所工作员讲解妇女解放翻身的故事，下午集体学习文化，大多数学习认字。第一所一百零八个妇女节省了吸烟等零用钱八万多元，买了学习用的纸笔。晚饭后为娱乐时间，大家都在热烈的学习新歌，有的还敲打着锣鼓扭起秧歌来。为使她们生活安适，该院已集中了所有妓院中的床铺，使她们全部有床睡，并在各所建设炉灶，供给她们作饭、烧水，她们也自动的分组值班，自己动手烧水、封炉子。她们从前存放在妓院的财物，自昨日起，已分别推代表前往取回。个别有小孩的，还帮助她们把孩子领来看望她们。为尽速医治她们的疾病，该院所附设的医疗组，昨（二十八）日已正式开始作普遍检治。并已将患有严重性病、子宫瘤和心脏病的四个妇女送往医院治疗。此外，中央妇婴保健所也派来六位医生，带有小型Ｘ光机一架帮助医疗工作。从这些事实中，已使她们觉悟到人民政府解放她们的诚意。对人民政府封闭妓院解放自己表示感谢。
