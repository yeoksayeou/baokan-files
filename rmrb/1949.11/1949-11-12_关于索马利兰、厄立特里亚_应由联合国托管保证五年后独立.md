Regarding Somaliland, the Soviet representative pointed out that the majority group's proposal, including the suggestion in the Bevin-Sforza secret agreement to place Somaliland under Italian trusteeship, remains essentially unchanged. Such a decision violates the wishes and will of the people of Somaliland. Our organization must consider the people's will, who do not want Italian trusteeship and demand independence, or at most, temporary trusteeship by the United Nations. The majority group's decision in the subcommittee makes it possible for Italy to maintain control over Somaliland indefinitely. The majority group's decision in the subcommittee states: Italian trusteeship will last for ten years, unless the United Nations General Assembly decides otherwise before the expiration of this specified period. This ambiguity in the term of Italian trusteeship makes it possible for Italy and its government to manage Somaliland in such a way that the country is not ready for independence at the end of the ten-year period.

The Soviet representative said: The Soviet delegation insists that a decision must be taken on Somaliland that truly guarantees Somaliland's independence after five years, and that during this period, a trusteeship capable of genuinely preparing Somaliland for independence should be established—a United Nations trusteeship, a trusteeship that conforms to the requirements and will of the people of Somaliland themselves.

As for Eritrea, the Soviet representative said that the Soviet delegation believes it should be under UN trusteeship and granted independence after five years.

The General Assembly should satisfy Abyssinia's legitimate minimum requirement to obtain access to the sea. Therefore, it is necessary to cede part of the territory of Eritrea to Abyssinia, so that it can have access to the sea through the port of Assab.

The Soviet representative pointed out: The Soviet proposal also takes into account the interests of the Italian people. To this end, the Soviet proposal stipulates that representatives of Italy should also be included in the advisory committees of Eritrea and Somaliland, in addition to representatives of indigenous residents, European residents, and Abyssinia.

The Peruvian representative, speaking after Yaroslav, supported the majority group's proposal in the subcommittee to carve up the former Italian colonies.

Liberian representative Cooper opposed the recommendation on Somaliland in the draft resolution of the subcommittee. He pointed out that the people of Somaliland have strongly expressed their desire for independence. The Liberian representative drew the committee's attention to the fact that the British authorities used force to disperse "the demonstration of the people of Somaliland fighting for independence," and emphasized that the American representative in the subcommittee had not answered the question of whether the British authorities would continue to use troops against the people fighting for the independence of their country.

Polish representative Wierblowski criticized the draft resolution proposed by the majority group in the subcommittee, saying that this proposal, with British amendments, is a new version of the Bevin-Sforza plan. The Polish delegation supports the Soviet proposal.

Fawzi Bey, head of the Egyptian delegation, said that his delegation would not sign the draft proposed by the subcommittee, pointing out that "certain countries" showed "great forgetfulness of the interests of the Libyan people" when the subcommittee made decisions on the Libyan issue. The Egyptian representative also announced that he would oppose the subcommittee's proposal on Somaliland.

The Political Committee will continue to discuss the issue of former Italian colonies.

    关于索马利兰、厄立特里亚
    应由联合国托管保证五年后独立
    谈到索马利兰，苏联代表指出，在多数集团的建议中，贝文——史佛卓秘密协定中所包括的把索马利兰交由意大利托管的建议实际上保存未变。这样的决定，违反索马利兰人民的愿望和意志。我们的机构不能不考虑到人民的这种意志，他们不愿让意大利托管，而要求独立，至多也只能是由联合国暂时托管。小组委员会多数集团的决定，使得意大利对索马利兰的控制有可能保持到无限期。小组委员会多数集团的决定说：意大利的托管将持续十年，除非联合国大会在这规定的期限满期之前另有决定。这种对意大利托管期限的含糊其词，使得意大利及其政府有可能用这样的办法管理索马利兰，使得该国在十年期满时，还没有独立的准备。
    苏联代表说：苏联代表团坚持，关于索马利兰，必须采取能真正保证索马利兰在五年后独立的决定，并且，在这一期间，应该建立能够真正准备索马利兰独立的托管——联合国托管，合乎索马利兰人民自身的要求和意志的托管。
    至于厄立特里亚，苏联代表说，苏联代表团认为应由联合国托管，并于五年之后予以独立。
    大会应满足阿比西尼亚最低限度的取得出海口的合法要求。因此，割让一部分厄立特里亚的领土给阿比西尼亚，使之能经阿萨布港而出海，是必要的。
    苏联代表指出：苏联的建议还考虑到意大利人民的利益。本此目的，苏联的建议规定在厄立特里亚及索马利兰的咨询委员会中，除土著居民、欧洲居民以及阿比西尼亚的代表之外，还应吸收意大利的代表。
    继亚鲁疆发言的秘鲁代表，赞成小组委员会多数集团的力谋瓜分前意属殖民地的建议。
    利比利亚代表库波尔反对小组委员会决议草案中关于索马利兰的建议。他指出，索马利兰的人民强烈地表示了他们要求独立的愿望。利比利亚代表提请委员会注意英国当局用武力冲散“为争取独立而斗争的索马利兰人民示威”的事实，并强调小组委员会中的美国代表未曾回答英国当局是否将继续使用军队反对为自己国家的独立而斗争的人民这个问题。
    波兰代表维尔布洛夫斯基批评小组委员会多数集团所提出的草案，他说，这个加上了英国修正案的提案，是贝文——史佛卓计划的新版。波兰代表团支持苏联的建议。
    埃及代表团团长佛齐——贝说，他的代表团将不在小组委员会所提的草案上签字，他指出，小组委员会在决定利比利亚问题时，“某些国家”表现了“对利比利亚人民的利益非常健忘”。埃及代表并宣布将反对小组委员会关于索马利兰的提案。
    政治委员会将继续讨论前意大利殖民地问题。
