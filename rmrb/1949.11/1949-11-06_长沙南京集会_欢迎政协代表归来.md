Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, November 5th: General Cheng Qian, member of the Central People's Government and Vice Chairman of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission, along with CPPCC delegates Zhang Chong, Sun Zhiyuan, Ren Baige, Tian Bao, and Zhou Qin'yue, arrived in Changsha on the 2nd from Beijing. Leading figures from the Changsha Party, government, and military organs, including Huang Kecheng, Xiao Jingguang, Wang Shoudao, Jin Ming, Chen Mingren, Yuan Renyuan, and Yan Zixiang, along with representatives from various organizations, numbering over a hundred, went to the station to welcome them. That evening, the Changsha Party, government, and military organs jointly held a warm welcoming tea party. After Deputy Director Wang Shoudao of the Military Control Commission delivered a welcoming speech, General Cheng Qian responded, saying, "When we went to Beijing to participate in the CPPCC two months ago, the remnants of the Bai Chongxi bandit gang were still entrenched in parts of Hunan; when we returned, Hunan had been completely liberated and the so-called 'main force' of the Bai bandits had been annihilated. This is the result of the heroic advance of the People's Liberation Army." General Cheng Qian briefly shared his impressions of participating in the CPPCC, saying, "I personally received a very good education at this CPPCC session and was greatly encouraged by Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, which further increased my determination and courage to serve the people. Our task in the future is to make every effort under the leadership of Chairman Mao to thoroughly implement the Common Program of the CPPCC to build a democratic and prosperous new Hunan." CPPCC minority representatives Zhang Chong and Tian Bao, who were passing through Changsha, also delivered speeches at the meeting.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, November 5th: Over three thousand representatives from all sectors of Nanjing society held a grand meeting on the afternoon of the 3rd to warmly welcome the 26 returning delegates of the People's Liberation Army's Third Field Army and the CPPCC delegates in Nanjing, including Su Yu, Liang Xi, Jiang Weiqing, Chen Shiqu, and Zhu Kezhen. Vice Mayor Ke Qingshi first delivered a welcoming speech, guaranteeing on behalf of the million-plus citizens of Nanjing that the people of Nanjing would resolutely support all resolutions of the CPPCC, resolutely support the Central People's Government, and strive for the realization of the Common Program under its leadership. At the meeting, Su Yu, Lin Zun, Zhu Kezhen, and others all delivered speeches in succession. General Su Yu said: The CPPCC is a grand meeting of the world's anti-aggression camp and a conference to consolidate China's and the world's victory. The democratic spirit of this conference is unprecedented in Chinese history. It was produced based on Chinese history. It seriously discussed and passed the great charter of the Chinese people. Through solemn democratic elections, the Central People's Government was established. This is the result of the Chinese people's struggle over the past hundred years, especially the past twenty years. Finally, General Su Yu pointed out: We should convey the spirit of this CPPCC meeting to every Nanjing citizen, so that every one of our people, based on the spirit of the conference and in accordance with the Common Program of the CPPCC, will unite under the leadership of the Central People's Government headed by Chairman Mao and strive to build an independent, democratic, peaceful, unified, and prosperous new China.
