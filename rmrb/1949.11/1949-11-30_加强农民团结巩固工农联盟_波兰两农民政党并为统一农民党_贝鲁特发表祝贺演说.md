Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 29th: TASS, Warsaw dispatch: The extraordinary congresses of the two Polish peasant parties—the Peasant Party and the Polish Peasant Party—were held in Warsaw on the 26th. The congress heard reports from the leading bodies of the two parties and adopted a resolution to merge the two parties into the United Peasant Party.
　　The unified representative congress of the two parties opened on the 27th, presided over by Kowalski, Chairman of the Polish Parliament. Polish President Beirut, Minister of Defense Rokossovsky, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party Sierankiewicz, representative of the Democratic Party Baszkowski, and representative of the Labor Party Idzikowski delivered congratulatory speeches to the congress.
　　At the meeting, a report was read on the production guarantees completed by Polish peasants to celebrate the convening of the congress. As of November 25th, approximately 6,000 villages had completed their work, accounting for 41 percent of all villages in Poland. According to existing materials, approximately 500,000 peasants participated, with a total value of their work and production reaching 574 million zlotys (Polish currency). The meeting adopted the agenda of the congress and heard reports from Kowalski, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Peasant Party, and Nisko, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Polish Peasant Party, on the "Programmatic Principles of the Farmers' Unity Movement."
　　
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 29th: TASS, Warsaw dispatch: During the session of the Polish two-peasant-party merger congress, Polish President Beirut delivered a congratulatory speech stating: All of Poland welcomes the merger of the two peasant parties with joy and satisfaction. After years of internal division, a united peasant party has become the largest, most powerful, and single peasant political organization. We believe that the unity of the peasant movement will be solid and unbreakable in the future. This is not only important to the peasant masses but also to all the people. The merger of the two peasant parties has consolidated the political foundation of our people's democratic state—the alliance of workers, peasants, and working intellectuals—and consolidated the foundation of our people's power. The unity of the peasant movement will undoubtedly have a greater impact on the full development of social and political life in the Polish countryside.
　　The enemies of the working people—landlords, capitalists, and their Mikolajczyk gang agents—have attempted and are continuing to attempt to undermine and obstruct the peasant movement and its progress by all means. In a free Poland liberated from the great landlords and capitalists, we must do everything we can to consolidate and develop the peasant movement and raise it to a new height. The greatest and most important task facing the Polish people's government is to attract millions of broad masses of urban and rural working people to conscious social and political life. The participation of the working masses in the social and political life of our country and their role in the economic and cultural development of the people are greater and more important than at any time in history.
　　Talking about the achievements in agriculture after the war, Beirut stated: The monetary value of agricultural production per person—in both cultivation and animal husbandry—is now 12 percent higher than before the war. Industry has achieved great success and has completed the three-year recovery plan two months ahead of schedule. For many generations, peasants have longed for a free and creative life. In the struggle for the right to such a life, millions of the finest fighters among the working people sacrificed themselves. In this struggle, the laboring peasants, handicraftsmen, and intellectuals, infused with the great ideals of the teachings of the leaders of the proletarian revolution, fought side by side with the workers under the red banner for a long time. Today, these ideals have triumphed in one-third of the world, enabling hundreds of millions of people to build new forms of social life.

　　加强农民团结巩固工农联盟
  　波兰两农民政党并为统一农民党
    贝鲁特发表祝贺演说
    【新华社北京二十九日电】塔斯社华沙讯：波兰的两个农民政党——农民党和波兰农民党非常代表大会，二十六日在华沙举行。大会听取两党领导机构的报告，并通过两党合并为统一农民党的决定。
    二十七日两党统一代表大会开幕，由波兰议会主席科瓦尔斯基主持。波兰总统贝鲁特，国防部长罗科索夫斯基，波兰统一工人党中央委员会书记西伦凯维兹，民主党代表巴西科夫斯基，劳动党代表意迪茨奥尔分别向大会致贺。
    会上宣读了关于波兰农民完成为庆祝大会召开而作的生产保证的报告。至十一月二十五日为止，约有六千个村庄已完成工作，这是波兰全部村庄的百分之四十一。据现有材料，参加的农民约有五十万，其工作和生产的总值达五亿七千四百万兹罗提（波币）。会议通过了大会议程，并听取农民中央党理事会主席科瓦尔斯基和波兰农民党中央理事会主席尼斯科关于“农民统一运动纲领原则”的报告。
    【新华社北京二十九日电】塔斯社华沙讯：在波兰两农民政党合并大会席上，波兰总统贝鲁特发表祝贺演说称：全波兰都怀着愉快和满意的心情来欢迎两农民政党的合并。在多年的内部分裂后，一个团结的农民党已成为最大的、强有力的和单一的农民政治团体。我们相信今后农民运动的团结将是坚固而牢不可破。这不仅对农民群众是重要的，而且对全体人民也是重要的。两农民政党的合并，巩固了我们人民民主国家的政治基础——工人、农民和劳动知识分子的联盟，巩固了我们人民政权的基础。农民运动的统一。无疑地将更大地影响波兰农村的社会和政治生活的全力发展。
    劳动人民的敌人——地主、资本家及其米柯拉兹科匪帮代理人，曾企图并且正继续企图用一切方法破坏和阻挠农民运动及其进展。在从大地主和资本家下面解放出来的自由波兰，我们必须尽我们的所能来巩固与发展农民运动，并把它提高到一个新的高度。波兰人民政权所面临的最伟大和最重要的任务是吸引千百万的广大的城乡劳动人民到自觉的社会和政治生活中。劳动群众的参加我国的社会和政治生活，在人民的经济和文化的发展中的作用，与历史上任何时期相较，都更大和更重要。
    谈到战后的农业成就，贝鲁特称：每人的农业生产的货币价值——在耕作和牲畜饲养两者上——现在高于战前百分之十二。工业已获得了巨大的成功，已提前两个月完成了三年复兴计划。农民许多代以来都在渴望着自由和创造性的生活。在为争取这样的生活权利的斗争中，牺牲了劳动人民中的千千万万最优秀的斗士。在这一斗争中，劳动农民、手工业者和知识分子，灌注着无产阶级革命领袖教言的伟大理想，曾长时间地在红色的战旗下与工人并肩作战。今天，这些理想已在三分之一的地球上取得了胜利，使得亿万人民能够来建设新形式的社会生活。
