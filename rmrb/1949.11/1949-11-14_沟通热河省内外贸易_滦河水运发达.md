Xinhua News Agency, Chengde, 13th: With the support of the Rehe Provincial People's Government, the Luan River water transport, connecting Rehe and eastern Hebei, is becoming increasingly developed. Boats sailing between Chengde City and Luan County are constantly traveling back and forth. To develop Luan River water transport, the province established a shipping company in late August, undertaking freight transport for both public and private entities. In the two months since then, the shipping company has provided interest-free loans of 4 billion yuan (Northeast currency) to boatmen in counties along the river to build new boats. Recent statistics show that 150 new boats have been launched, bringing the total number of boats, including old ones, to 228, exceeding the number of boats navigating the river before the War of Resistance Against Japan by 14 percent. From August 22nd to October 22nd, the province transported over 540,000 jin of grain, medicinal materials, furs, and other goods through the Luan River, and imported over 480,000 jin of gasoline, salt, reed mats, and other goods. With the province's railways not yet restored and many roads destroyed, Luan River water transport plays a vital role in facilitating trade inside and outside the province.

    沟通热河省内外贸易
    滦河水运发达
    【新华社承德十三日电】在热河省人民政府扶植下，沟通热河与冀东的滦河水运日趋发达。航行承德市与滦县间的船只来往不绝。为发达滦河水运，该省于八月下旬成立了航运公司，承办公私货运。两月余以来，航运公司先后以无利贷款四十亿元（东北币），贷予沿河各县船户制造新船。最近统计，下水的新船已达一百五十只，连旧船达二百二十八只，已超过抗战以前航行该河的船只百分之十四。从八月二十二日到十月二十二日，该省经由滦河共运出了粮食、药材、皮毛等五十四万余斤，运入汽油、食盐、苇席等四十八万余斤。在该省铁路尚未恢复、公路又多被冲毁的情况下，滦河水运对沟通省内外贸易的作用极大。
