Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 6th: Guo Moruo published an essay in the inaugural issue of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Monthly, entitled: "October Revolution, Universal Celebration."

The great October Revolution is celebrating its thirty-second anniversary today. These are thirty-two years of brilliant splendor in human history, and also thirty-two years of arduous creation. Each year's commemoration represents the overcoming of a period of hardship and also adds to a period of glory. Each year's commemoration gives the people of the world new strength, new encouragement, new illumination, and a new example.

The October Revolution is a new epoch in which the people turned themselves over and created a new historical era. This is not only a festival for the Soviet people, but also a common festival for the people of all nations striving for liberation around the world. Taking our China as an example, without the October Revolution, we would not have the People's Republic of China today; without the thirty-two years of arduous creation of the Soviet Union, we would not have the great achievements of today's People's Revolution.

The October Revolution eliminated the Russian imperialism of the Tsarist era, and the Second World War mainly relied on the strength of the Soviet Union to eliminate the three imperialist countries of Germany, Japan, and Italy. In this way, the strength of the imperialist aggressive camp was weakened, and our countries that were subjected to imperialist aggression were relieved of many shackles.

Due to the existence of the Soviet Union, the world already has a strongest fortress of peace, and due to the existence of the Soviet Union, it has directly and indirectly encouraged the people of the world. After the Second World War, many people's democratic countries have emerged in Eastern Europe and East Asia. In this way, the strength of the anti-imperialist peace camp has been increased, and our countries that have been subjected to imperialist aggression have gained many friendly armies.

Our People's Great Revolution has been able to rapidly obtain all the splendid and great victories it has today, and the People's Republic of China has been able to be established so rapidly and firmly. The direct and indirect support given to us by the Soviet Union after the success of the October Revolution is a huge factor. Indirect support is as mentioned above, and direct support is even too numerous to mention.

After the success of the October Revolution, the Soviet Union was the first to automatically propose to us the abolition of all unequal treaties; during the Great Revolution of 1926-1927, the Soviet Union helped us to achieve initial victories; in 1937, it helped us in the War of Resistance Against Japan; and finally, on August 15, 1945, it helped us to liberate the entire Northeast, which had been occupied for fourteen years. We can never forget these past events.

Wasn't it the Soviet Union that declared the establishment of the People's Republic of China on October 1st and then announced its formal recognition of our people's regime on the second day? After the US imperialists suffered a miserable defeat in their sinful policy toward China, they still supported and condoned the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique, which was struggling to survive, in blockading us at sea, and instigated some petty followers in the East, such as Syngman Rhee and Quirino, to brew some kind of "Pacific Anti-Communist Alliance," also attempting to carry out a blockade from the sea to hinder our recovery and construction. And at this time, wasn't it the Soviet Union that concluded a trade agreement with our Northeast, providing us with the construction equipment we urgently needed, and sending expert teams to provide assistance? When plague occurred in the Northeast and Chahar, the Soviet Union sent an epidemic prevention team to help us eradicate it and save the lives of our people. Such sincere assistance is absolutely impossible to obtain from imperialist countries. Think about it, besides using atomic bombs to scare some neurasthenic people, isn't American imperialism still openly advocating the use of germ warfare to eliminate opponents on Wall Street?

There is no doubt that the October Revolution Day is a festival shared by the people of the world, and we, the Chinese people, should commemorate it as our own festival. Commemorating it as our own festival is not something that has only started today. Even during the period when the Kuomintang reactionaries controlled the government, progressive people regarded this festival as a day of struggle every year. The reactionaries' obliteration, distortion, and suppression never froze the people's enthusiasm. Such enthusiasm, on this day this year, when we the people have become masters, will naturally be freely and extensively spread throughout China like the sunshine.

But what should we pay attention to when commemorating this great people's festival? Without a doubt, we should pay attention to these matters that I can think of. We should deepen and expand our understanding of the Soviet Union. Influenced by the deception, slander, and intimidation of the reactionaries, there are still many people who cannot understand the Soviet Union even today, or who have some understanding but not very deeply. We should do more enlightenment work for these people. Introducing the truth about the Soviet Union as much as possible and refuting the distortions of the reactionaries as much as possible are all things that enlightenment work should entail. But the main reason for the lack of understanding of the Soviet Union is a problem of ideology. Therefore, we should also do more work from the basics, promote Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and universally establish patriotic internationalism. When thoughts are cleared, emotional obstacles will be easily cleared.

We should deepen and expand our learning from the Soviet Union in all aspects. The valuable experience of the Soviet Union in building the country over the past thirty-two years is a common treasure shared by all mankind. Today, when we are doing our best to step up construction, it is even more our current model, and we should absorb it as much as possible. In the past, we have achieved some success in learning from the Soviet Union in literature, art, and social sciences, but there is a great gap in natural sciences and technical sciences. Today, it is time for us to break this gap. The progress of the Soviet Union in natural sciences and technical sciences is also advancing by leaps and bounds. At the stage when we are laying the foundation for our national construction, we should step up the absorption of experience in this area. If the foundation is laid well, the superstructure will be built firmly. The People's Government has long paid attention to this, and it is necessary to vigorously promote it from all aspects, but it is also hoped that experts and young people will automatically awaken, step up the study of Russian, and step up contact with Soviet science.

Of course, we should also step up the elimination of all domestic reactionaries. We must eliminate the reactionaries with guns, and we must also be vigilant against the reactionaries without guns. The history of the Soviet Union's national construction since the October Revolution warns us: we must always be wary of the enemy! The thirty-two years of the Soviet Union's national construction are also thirty-two years of constant vigilance. It is because of this constant vigilance that the victory of the October Revolution has been consolidated and the success of socialist construction has been guaranteed. And the Soviet Union has never relaxed its vigilance today, especially in ideological construction. We should learn from this experience to consolidate our own revolutionary victory and to guarantee the success of new democratic construction.

Of course, we should also guard against all foreign imperialist conspiracies of aggression. We must consolidate our own national defense. This defense line should be popularized in military, economic, and cultural aspects. We cannot ignore any tangible aggression, nor can we ignore any intangible aggression. The "democratic individualists" that the American reactionary government keeps in mind must be especially vigilant here, so as not to be hooked and cut off from the people. Internationally, we should consolidate the peace front headed by the Soviet Union, step up the movement to defend world peace, and thoroughly oppose the Titoists of Yugoslavia—the traitors of people's democracy.

The imperialist aggressive camp has indeed been weakened after the October Revolution and the Second World War. Today, British and French imperialism has become so old that it is almost becoming an appendage of American imperialism. American imperialism itself, due to the increasingly approaching inevitable economic panic and the increasingly bankrupt world policy of going against the tide, has fully demonstrated the reality of a paper tiger. But the closer they get to the end, the more frantic they will become. Today, the new fascist tide of anti-people forces headed by the US imperialism is beginning to flood the new and old continents. The US Federal Court has declared the eleven leaders of the American Communist Party guilty of patriotism, and the reactionary government of Australia, a US imperialist lackey, immediately followed suit, and the reactionary government of Greece, another lackey, is carrying out even greater massacres. To commemorate the October Revolution, we must resolutely oppose this tide and block this tide. We cannot relax our vigilance against the conspiracies of the warmongers in the slightest.

In a word: the October Revolution Day is a festival celebrated by the whole world. But we must guarantee that this festival is celebrated by the whole world forever. Let us shout like this:

Strengthen the friendship and cooperation between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union!

Step up learning from the Soviet Union, and absorb experience from the Soviet Union's construction in military, political, economic, cultural and other aspects!

Eliminate all domestic enemies and carry the revolutionary war to the end!

Guard against the restoration of all domestic and foreign enemies, and strive for the construction of new democracy!

Oppose the traitors of people's democracy—the Titoists!

Oppose the anti-communist frenzy of reactionary governments such as the new fascist American, Australian, and Greek governments!

Consolidate the democratic peace camp headed by the Soviet Union!

Eliminate the aggressive war of imperialism's dying struggle!

Strive to defend lasting world peace!

Long live the victory of people's democracy!

Long live the victory of Mao Zedong Thought!

Long live the popularization of Marxism-Leninism!

　　十月革命，普天同庆
    郭沫若
    【新华社北京六日电】郭沫若于中苏友好月刊创刊号发表论文，题为：十月革命，普天同庆。
    伟大的十月革命，今天迎接它的三十二周年纪念了。这是人类史上光辉灿烂的三十二年，也是艰难缔造的三十二年。每年的纪念表示着克服了一段的艰难，也就增加着一段的光辉。每年的纪念都给予全世界的人民以新的力量，新的鼓励，新的照明，新的示范。
    十月革命是人民翻身，创造新的历史时代的一个新纪元。这不仅是苏联人民的节庆，同时是全世界争取解放的各民族人民的共同节庆。单拿我们中国来说，没有十月革命，我们还不会就有中华人民共和国的今天，没有苏联的三十二年的艰难缔造，我们还不会就有今天的人民革命的伟大成就。
    十月革命消灭了一个沙皇时代的俄罗斯帝国主义，二次世界大战主要就靠着苏联的力量又消灭了德日意三个帝国主义国家，就这样便削弱了帝国主义侵略阵营的力量，使我们受着帝国主义侵略的国家便解除了不少的束缚。
    由于苏联的存在，全世界已经有了一个最坚强的和平堡垒，由于苏联的存在，直接间接鼓舞了全世界的人民。在二次大战后，在东欧和东亚已经有了不少的人民民主国家出现，就这样便增加了反帝国主义和平阵营的力量，使我们受着帝国主义侵略的国家便获得了不少的友军。
    我们的人民大革命能够迅速地获得今天所有的这样辉煌的伟大胜利，中华人民共和国得以这样迅速而且巩固地建立起来，十月革命成功后的苏联所直接间接给予我们的支援是一个极大的因素。间接的支援有如上述，直接的支援更是举不胜举。
    十月革命成功以后，苏联首先自动向我们提出，取消了一切不平等条约；一九二六至一九二七年的大革命，苏联帮助我们获得了初期的胜利；一九三七年又帮助我们对日抗战；最后在一九四五年八月十五日更帮助我们把沦陷了十四年的全东北解放了。这些往事我们是永远不能忘记的。
    中华人民共和国在十月一日宣告成立，在第二天便宣布正式承认我们人民政权的，不又是苏联吗？美帝国主义在它的罪恶的对华政策遭了惨败之后，依然支持并纵容着釜底游魂的蒋介石反动派在海上来封锁我们，并嗾使东方的一些小喽罗季里诺、李承晚之流酝酿着什么“太平洋反共同盟”，同样是企图从海上来进行封锁，阻挠我们的恢复和建设。而在这个时候和我们东北缔结了贸易协定，以我们所急需的建设器材供给我们，并派遣专家团来实行援助的，不又是苏联吗？东北和察北发生鼠疫，苏联派出防疫队来帮助我扑灭，打救我们老百姓的生命。这些赤心赤意的援助，求之于帝国主义的国家是绝对不可能的。请想想看，美帝国主义除了拿原子弹来恐骇一些神经衰弱者之外，不是还在明目张胆鼓吹，要用细菌战来消除华尔街的反对者吗？
    毫无疑问，十月革命节是全世界人民所共有的节庆，我们中国人民是要把它当成自己的节庆来纪念的。这样当成自己的节庆一样来纪念倒不是在今天才开始的了。就是在国民党反动派控制着政权的期间，进步人士年年今日都把这个节庆当成了斗争的日子。反动派的抹杀、歪曲、弹压，始终不曾冻结得人民的热情。这样的热情在今年今天，我们人民已经成为了主人的今天，自然会自由自在地以极大的规模象太阳光普照一样，洋溢于全中国了。
    但我们在纪念这个伟大的人民的节庆上我们应当注意些什么呢？毫无疑问，我们应当注意就我所能想到的这些事项。我们应该加深并扩大对于苏联的认识。受了反动派的蒙蔽、诬蔑、恫胁的影响，就在今天对于苏联不能了解的人还是不少，或者有着多少的了解而亦不甚深入，我们对于这样的人是应该多多做启蒙工作的。尽量介绍苏联的真实，尽量驳斥反动派的歪曲，都是启蒙工作所应有的事。但对苏联的不了解，主要还是思想上的问题。因此我们还应该多从基本上做工夫，宏扬马列主义和毛泽东思想，把爱国的国际主义普遍地建立起来。思想打通，感情上的窒碍也就容易打通了。
    我们应该加深并扩大向苏联各方面的学习。苏联三十二年来的宝贵的建国经验是全人类所共有的环宝，在今天我们正在用尽全力来加紧建设的时候更是我们当前的范本，我们是应该尽量吸收的。向来我们在学习苏联上，对于文艺和社会科学，比较有些成就，但对于自然科学和技术科学，便有很大的隔阂。在今天我们是应该打破这种隔阂的时候了。苏联在自然科学和技术科学方面的进展同样是突飞猛进，在我们建国工作打基础的阶级上正应该对于这一方面的经验加紧吸收，要基础打得好，上层建筑也才建得牢。人民政府早就注意到了这一层，得要用大力从各方面来推进，但也希望专家们和青年们自动地觉醒起来，加紧学习俄文，并加紧和苏联科学发生联系。
    当然我们还应该加紧肃清一切国内的反动派。拿枪的反动派固然要肃清它，不拿枪的反动派我们也得加紧警惕。十月革命以来苏联建国的历史告诫我们：时常要提防敌人！苏联建国的三十二年也就是不断警惕的三十二年。就因为有这不断的警惕才巩固了十月革命的胜利，并保障了社会主义建设的成功。而苏联在今天是一直没有松懈他的警惕的。尤其在思想建设方面。我们正应该学习这种经验来巩固我们自己的革命胜利，来保障新民主主义建设的成功。
    当然我们也还应该提防一切外来的帝国主义的侵略阴谋。我们要巩固我们自己的国防。这国防线要普及于军事的、经济的、文化的各方面。我们不能忽视任何有形的侵略，也不能忽视任何无形的侵略。美国反动政府所念念不忘的“民主的个人主义者”在这儿尤须警惕着自己，不要上了钓钩，自绝于人民。在国际上我们便应该巩固以苏联为首的和平阵线，加紧保卫世界和平的运动，彻底反对南斯拉夫的铁托主义者——人民民主的叛徒。
    帝国主义的侵略阵营经过十月革命和二次大战诚然是削弱了。在今天英法帝国主义竟衰老到几乎要成为美帝国主义的附庸。美帝国主义自身为了不可避免的经济恐慌的日益迫近，倒行逆施的世界政策的日趋破产，已充分显示着纸老虎的实际。但它们愈趋末路，是会愈见疯狂的。今天以美帝为首的反人民的新法西斯蒂的狂潮正在新旧两大陆开始泛滥。美国的联邦法院宣判了美共领袖十一人的爱国有罪，美帝走狗澳大利亚的反动政府便立即效颦，另一走狗希腊反动政府更大事屠杀。我们要纪念十月革命，便必须坚决地反对这股狂潮，并阻塞这股狂潮。我们对于战争贩子们的阴谋丝毫也不能放松。
    一句话归总：十月革命节是普天同庆的一个节日。但我们必须保障这个节日的普天同庆到于永远。让我们这样高呼吧：
    加强中苏两大民族的友谊和合作！
    加紧向苏联学习，向苏联的军事、政治、经济、文化各种方面的建设吸收经验！
    肃清一切国内敌人，将革命战争进行到底！
    提防一切国内外敌人的复辟，努力新民主主义的建设！
    反对人民民主的叛徒——铁托主义者！
    反对新法西斯帝美澳希等反动政府的反共狂潮！
    巩固以苏联为首的民主和平阵营！
    消灭帝国主义垂死挣扎的侵略战争！
    为保卫世界持久和平而奋斗！
    人民民主胜利万岁！
    毛泽东思想胜利万岁！
    马恩列斯主义普及万岁！
