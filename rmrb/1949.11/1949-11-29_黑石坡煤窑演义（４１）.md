　　Romance of the Black Rock Slope Coal Mine (41)
    Kang Tuo
    But Da San was quite strange, he was silently carrying rock alone. It turned out that since the village had held the struggle meeting, he had finally vented some anger and felt that liberation, turning over, and land reform were indeed good. Later, seeing that Xi Lu's big kiln had also been resolved fairly and reasonably, and that the poor peasant group and the worker-peasant association had also held meetings to discuss opening this big kiln, he was even more motivated, thinking that although it was an earth kiln, the coal was really good, and the kiln could still be tidied up, and there was still potential! If the village could really organize it and let him show off his skills, making the kiln airtight and opening the ventilation shaft, making it a good kiln for years to come, then he would be considered to have achieved something, and he wouldn't feel wronged in his life! Besides, the village couldn't find a better way to make a living than this, and perhaps no one remembered the gods and ghosts anymore! As long as Hua Da led well, the villagers discussed it well, and Xi Lu also put in some effort, he would work hard! How could it not go well? He happily thought to himself, attending meetings to discuss opening the kiln, enthusiastically speaking and offering ideas, even thinking about this in his sleep; who knew that in less than two days, the village's opinions became a mess, and no one had a clear idea, and the traitor Niu Bao and his gang opposed opening the kiln, and no one criticized them! Even Hua Da, Lao Yin, and Shuan Cheng seemed to disapprove of opening the kiln, and the matter was shelved! This was truly a bucket of cold water that completely extinguished the fire in his heart! He was too lazy to attend meetings and didn't want to stay in the village anymore! His life was also quite difficult, and he carried rock listlessly every day, carrying a hundred or two hundred catties each time, sending it from the mountain road to the Yangquan Iron Factory, while watching the Yangquan Power Plant chimneys spewing white smoke and the Yangquan Iron Factory's large boiler spewing white steam every day. Sometimes he would encounter the train that went from the Fourth Mine to Yangquan without stopping work, making a sound and releasing a puff of fog. These smoke and fog surrounded Yangquan City's foreign houses, tile houses, and the traffic of cars and horses. Da San would watch it for a while; there was also the elevated railway that the Japanese had built two or three years ago from the hillside behind the iron factory all the way to the northwest. The gray-white cement road frames of that elevated line looked like towers from a distance. The Japanese surrendered before they could finish installing the lines and completing the work. Da San could also stay and watch this road frame for a while. After liberation, most of these mines and factories in Yangquan were almost shut down, but now most of them have started work. It is said that the Zhengtai Railway will also be repaired soon, which is really the taste of liberation! But why can't the big kiln on Black Rock Slope and some good kilns and mining areas in nearby villages be tidied up and mined? Many old people's lives are really difficult. Land reform, the terrain and soil are scarce, and it's still not possible without industrial and mining production... Da San couldn't figure these things out no matter how he thought about it. He was like a fool all day long, carrying rock once, earning one or two catties of millet, and he would go to Yangquan to drink two liang of wine. If he was lucky, he would also look for old partners from the past to ask around, to see if he could find a way to make a living in the Fourth Mine or other places. He wanted to wait until the village distributed the fruits, and then he would find a proper large machine kiln and drill down to work for a day, even if it was just for half a day.
    
    Thirty-Eight Discussion
    After Shuan Cheng led the discussion and distribution of grain, and completed some piecemeal work, because it was too troublesome to convert clothes and furniture into rice, and it couldn't be completed in half a day, and seeing that production in the village couldn't be started, the whole village was restless day and night about this matter, he discussed it with the cadres, and asked the turn-over association groups to discuss some opinions, and then convened a joint meeting of poor peasant group members, worker-peasant association group leaders, and various cadres, specifically to discuss production. Some people with methods and skills in production were also invited to participate; people were very enthusiastic about attending the meeting. Those invited to participate in the meeting, except for Da San who went to Yangquan and didn't arrive, totaled forty or fifty people, and some people who weren't invited also went on their own. Shuan Cheng talked about the reasons why clothes and furniture couldn't be distributed for the time being, and then turned the topic to how important production was, and Lao Yin arranged for everyone to discuss opening the kiln, not to delay work, etc., and then asked everyone to offer ideas and think of ways to discuss it well. Xiao Yang Gui rushed to say a few words, "Everyone, everyone! Speaking of which, I am assigned to manage production in the worker-peasant association, and Comrade Yin specifically arranged for me to be more concerned about production; but I can't do anything, that's my fault. Anyway, now it's democracy, everyone is in charge, make the decision! I can't do it! Whoever has good methods in production should bring them out, I guarantee to run errands and be happy to do it for everyone!"

　　黑石坡煤窑演义　（４１）
    康濯
    但大三却怪稀罕，他一个人在不声不响地担硔。原来自从村里开过斗争会以后，他总算也多少出了点气，并觉着解放、翻身、土地改革还就是不赖。后来又见喜禄的大窑也公平合理地解决了，而且贫农组和工农会还开会讨论了要开这座大窑，他更有了点劲头，心想这虽说是个土窑，可炭实在强，窑也还能拾掇，还有闹头！村里真要能张罗起来，让自己这一身把式给施展施展，把窑打出水透开风筒，闹成个长年永辈的好窑，那自己也算是有头有尾，一辈子也就不觉冤屈了！再说村里也寻不下比这再好的营生，什么神呀鬼的如今许也没人结记了！只要华大好好领导，村里大伙好好计议，喜禄也卖点力气，他反正拼死命也干！那还能闹不好么？他自己满心高兴地想着，开会讨论开窑，也就兴冲冲地说话出主意，连黑家睡觉也光想这事；谁知没两天，村里的意见闹了个一团糟，没人拿个准主意，汉奸牛宝那伙反对开这窑，也没人批评！就连华大老尹和拴成，也象是不赞成开这窑，事情也就这么搁了浅！这真是一勺凉水把他心上的热火整个地浇灭了！他会也懒得开了，也不愿在村里呆不下去了！他生活也挺困难，每日就没劲没劲地担一遭硔，每回担个百二八十斤，从山坡大道上往阳泉铁厂送去，一边每日看看阳泉发电厂烟囱冒白烟和阳泉铁厂大锅炉吐白汽，有时碰见从四矿到阳泉那一节没停工的火车来去，叫一声放一股雾，这些烟雾围着阳泉市的洋房瓦房和车来马往，大三会＠＠地看一阵；还有日本在二三年前从铁厂后面山坡上一直往西北修的高线铁路，那架高线的灰白水泥路架，远看象一个个塔一般，日本没架上线没完了工就投降了，这路架大三也能呆着看一阵。阳泉这些矿厂，解放后差不多大都停了工，现在却大多开工了，听说正太铁路也快要修，这才够个解放的味哩！可为什么黑石坡的大窑和左近邻村还有些好窑好矿区就不能拾掇开采？多少老百姓生活正困难的不行，土地改革吧，这地势地土少，不闹工矿生产也还是不行呀……大三翻来复去地想不透这些事，整日又象傻＠傻＠地，担一遭硔，挣个一二斤小米，他就去阳泉喝二两酒，碰对了也寻寻过去的老伙计打问打问，看四矿或是别的地势能找到个营生不，他是想等村里分了果实，自己就找个正经机器大窑，钻下去干一天少俩半天算了。
    三十八　讨论
    这边拴成领导讨论和分配了粮食，又完成了一些零星工作以后，因为衣裳家具折米太麻烦，一半天也完不成，又眼见村里生产搞不起来，浑村为这事是咯嚷得日夜不安，他就和干部们商议了一下，又让翻身会各小组讨论了些意见，便召开了个贫农组员、工农会组长和各干部的合伙会，专门讨论生产，会上并邀了些生产上有办法有把式的人参加；人们到会的劲头很大，邀约了参加会的人，除开大三去了阳泉没到以外，共到了四五十号人，还有些没邀参加的人也自己找去了。拴成说了说衣裳家具一时不能分配的缘由，便拨转话头说到生产怎么重要，和老尹安插的叫大伙讨论开窑，不要耽误工作等等，接着就叫大伙出主意想办法，好好咯嚷讨论。下边小洋鬼又抢着说了几句道：“大伙大伙！说起来嘛我可是工农会里边分给掌管生产的，尹同志临走还特外安插过，叫我生产上头多操心；可我啥也闹球不成，这算是我的错。反正这如今民主，大伙当家掌柜拿主意吧！咱不行！谁们生产上头有高法尽管往出掏，我保管跑腿弄武地乐意给大伙办！”
