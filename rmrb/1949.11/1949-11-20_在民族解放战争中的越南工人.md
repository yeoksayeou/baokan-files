The Vietnamese Workers in the National Liberation War
By Liu Defu, Secretary of the Executive Committee of the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor

The Vietnamese national liberation resistance war has now entered its fifth year. Broadly speaking, Vietnam is currently divided into two parts: the occupied zone under the rule of French colonialists, including most cities and their surrounding areas; and the free zone under the jurisdiction of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, led by President Ho Chi Minh, which accounts for approximately 90 percent of the territory. This free zone includes several major fortresses and guerrilla areas, where fierce guerrilla activities are being conducted to isolate French military strongholds.

Depending on whether they live in the free zone or the occupied zone, the situation of Vietnamese workers also presents two different scenarios:

In the free zone, the situation of Vietnamese workers is that of free citizens playing a vanguard role in the war of resistance: they know that national liberation is the first step towards class liberation, and therefore they contribute all their efforts to the struggle against the French colonialists supported by American imperialism. They have voluntarily joined the army and guerrilla units, implemented a scorched-earth policy, destroying French enterprises, towns, and roads, and bringing machinery and raw materials from the cities to the guerrilla areas to establish factories for producing munitions.

In the army, the working class supplies a considerable number of soldiers. The proportion of workers in the army is as high as 10 percent, while the working class only accounts for 3 percent of the total population. In areas around cities or in mining areas, the proportion of workers even exceeds 50 percent. In the Hong Gai area, all officers, soldiers, and members of the resistance committee are workers. Generally, the best military cadres come from the working class. Several workers' names, such as Hong Tao from the Saigon-Cho Lon area and Sa Dao, the hero of landmine ambushes on 5th Street, have become national legends. They have destroyed many tanks and killed hundreds of French soldiers.

In terms of sabotage, workers in the cities destroyed the vast majority of French enterprises when they retreated at the outbreak of the war, such as mines, factories, and rubber plantations.

Since then, the Vietnamese army and guerrillas have closely cooperated with the workers in the French-occupied areas to carry out this work systematically. In 1947 alone, five million rubber trees were destroyed, felled, or burned, more than two million tin buckets and three million bowls (for collecting rubber sap) were destroyed, and many factories and shops were blown up or destroyed. In order to prevent the French army from using its technical advantages (tanks, heavy artillery, etc.) to attack our army, a systematic scorched-earth policy was implemented: all town aggregates and thick brick buildings in the countryside (except for churches and pagodas) that could be used by the enemy as fortifications were thoroughly destroyed. Roads were cut with transverse ditches almost every meter. Railways were moved to places more than two thousand kilometers away.

In order to establish munitions factories, workers organized themselves at the outbreak of the war to move machinery and resources to safe areas under the most difficult conditions. Pieces of iron weighing one or two tons were transported from the front lines through mud and cut-off roads, over mountains and through valleys, day and night, into the rear areas using primitive methods. Our porters walked hundreds of kilometers, sometimes without enough rice to eat. However, thanks to their self-sacrifice, today every province has at least one factory, and every region has a factory that manufactures hand grenades and repairs rifles.

Needless to say, in order to accomplish such work while fighting against a powerful and well-equipped enemy, the Vietnamese workers have endured indescribable suffering. Many workers have sacrificed their lives on the battlefield or in accidents caused by experimenting with munitions.

Most of the workers are currently in state-owned factories (mostly munitions factories). There, their lives are very arduous. For reasons of secrecy, munitions factories are located in deep forests far from cities and villages. They have to move frequently, and each time this arduous transportation work has to be done all over again. The supply of food, clothing, and medicine is difficult. Living conditions are often unhealthy, which increases the diseases that can be caused by the harsh climate.

However, with the improvement of the military situation, due to the government's concern and the organizational efforts of the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor (Viet Chung), the situation of workers is also improving. In state-owned factories, workers have better living conditions. They are now safer at work and can get better supplies of food, clothing, and medicine. In every factory, an enterprise committee, including worker representatives, cooperates with the factory director to ensure that workers' living and working conditions are handled in the best possible way. Through this enterprise committee, workers can also participate in discussions of the production plans of their factories. Their unions can regularly contact and discuss with the factory director to protect the workers' legitimate rights. In the event of disputes due to the malice of the factory director, the union may appeal to higher authorities of Viet Chung. The higher authorities will refer the case to appropriate higher government officials for inspection. The Viet Chung Executive Committee itself works closely with the Labor Bureau. Since the government consistently seriously considers the legitimate demands of workers, Viet Chung has so far been successful in defending the legitimate demands of workers.

Due to the different conditions of the regions in which the factories are located, the improvements achieved by each factory also vary. Generally, the union organizes collective supply services, collective kitchens, sports grounds, meeting rooms, reading rooms, and training courses to improve workers' political, cultural, and professional levels, with more or less material resources. In some factories, they have successfully moved workers' families to the vicinity of the factory, providing women with jobs and children with schools and playgrounds. It must be explained: these achievements are still small-scale due to our current lack of great possibilities.

In addition to factories with strategic importance, some factories and workshops producing various goods are being established in villages with better climates and easier supply problems. The lives of workers in these factories are much better.

As for private enterprises, they are still small-scale due to the military situation. Each private factory employs no more than ten workers. The union also organizes and protects these workers. However, in order to encourage the development of private enterprises necessary for supplying the army and the masses, some concessions should be made.

Regardless of the current pain and poverty, workers enthusiastically participate in the patriotic emulation movement called for by President Ho Chi Minh. Production speed is increasing in factories. In 1948, the total production increased by 60 percent compared to the previous year. In the Third War Zone, it doubled. In early 1947, it took 30 hours to make an anti-tank grenade, but now, thanks to new production methods, the same work only takes 30 minutes. There has also been significant progress in terms of quality. For example, the production of hand grenades that failed to explode has been successfully reduced from 20 percent in 1947 to 8 percent in early 1948 and 3 percent at the end of the same year.

In the areas temporarily occupied by the enemy, the lives of workers are completely different. The colonialists' regime of persecution and exploitation has been revived with all its terror. Under this regime, workers are treated worse than livestock. Goods are becoming increasingly scarce, and prices are constantly rising. Workers are always suspected of having contact with the resistance forces, and colonial-style repression is frequently carried out against them, making these areas a true hell on earth.

Due to our army's blockade of the enemy's positions, the lack of food is becoming increasingly acute. The price of rice has increased threefold compared to the liberated areas, fruits and vegetables tenfold, and firewood twentyfold. In some cities, even getting water is difficult. For example, in Hanoi and Haiphong, workers' families have to use water from muddy ponds for washing and sometimes for cooking.

In rubber plantations and coal mines, the colonialists make workers work 12 to 14 hours a day, undoubtedly to increase their profits, but also to prevent workers from having time to "engage in politics." Extortion and arrests are used to prevent the infiltration of "treason." Countless incidents of arbitrary arrests, torture, and on-the-spot executions on charges of contacting the resistance forces are occurring. Once a strike occurs, it becomes a good opportunity for French soldiers to surround the factory area and search every house for women and money.

However, nothing can stop the workers' hearts from turning towards the liberated areas. On the contrary, the workers' suffering more closely unites them with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and only the victory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam can liberate them from the hands of French colonialism. Workers have established underground organizations and maintain direct contact with the liberated areas and Viet Chung. Due to the French colonialists' brutal repression, open struggles for daily interests are not more frequent; however, workers in the occupied areas are secretly implementing a patient program of sabotage, preparing to participate and assist the army when the day of counter-offensive arrives.

In summary, the Vietnamese working class is fighting heroically, but its political and organizational level is still low. The Vietnamese working class must continue to struggle arduously, study more, and experience more difficulties and suffering. In any case, it has chosen the correct goal and taken the correct path. That goal is socialism; because only socialism can eliminate the exploitation of man by man. That path, in the current situation, is to follow the general struggle for democracy and peace in the world, led by the Soviet Union, to win true independence and true democracy. In the process of advancing, the Vietnamese working class has had and will certainly have many shortcomings and mistakes. However, with the support of the world democratic forces headed by the Soviet Union, with the assistance of the French working class, and with the assistance of neighboring China, the Vietnamese working class will certainly be able to correct its shortcomings and mistakes, overcome all difficulties, and win complete victory.

### 在民族解放战争中的越南工人

　　在民族解放战争中的越南工人
    越南总工会执行委员会书记  刘德福著
    越南的民族解放抵抗战争现在已进入第五个年头。大体上说，越南目前分成二个部分：在法国殖民者统治下的占领区，包括大部分城市及其邻近地区；在胡志明主席领导下的越南民主共和国政府统辖的自由区域，约占有百分之九十领土，包括若干主要的要塞以及几个大游击区，在其中进行着炽烈的反法军孤立据点的游击活动。
    依据生活在自由区或者生活在被占领区的不同，越南工人的情况也有着二种不同的局面：
    在自由区里，越南工人的情况是在抗战中起着先锋队作用的自由公民的情况：他们知道民族解放是走向阶级解放道路的第一步，因而他们就贡献全力于反对由美帝国主义支持的法国殖民者的斗争。他们自行参加了军队及游击队，按照焦土政策，破坏法国的企业、城镇及道路，并从城市里将机器及原料带到游击队里，以建立生产军火的工厂。
    在军队里，工人阶级供给着相当大量的士兵。在军队里，工人比例高到百分之十，而工人阶级仅占全人口百分之三。在城市四周或在矿区里，工人的比例甚至超过百分之五十。在宏关区，所有的军官、士兵以及抗战委员会的委员都是工人。一般地，最好的军事干部是来自工人阶级的。若干工人的名字：例如西贡，提岸区的洪涛，第五号街的地雷埋伏英雄沙道，已经成为全国的传奇了。他们都曾经破坏过许多坦克车，并杀掉了数百个法国兵。
    在破坏工作方面，城市里的工人，当战争爆发撤退时，破坏了法国企业绝大部分，例如矿坑、工厂、橡皮园。
    此项工作从那时起，越南军队及游击队就密切地配合法国占领区里的工人，一直有系统地进行着。仅在一九四七年里，五百万棵橡树曾被毁掉、砍掉、或烧掉，二百万以上的洋铁吊桶及三百万的碗（取橡树汁液用的）被破坏，许多工厂和铺子被爆炸或毁掉。为了阻止法国军队借技术上的优势（坦克车、重炮等）来进攻我们的军队，就实行了有系统的焦土政策：凡能被敌人用作碉堡的市镇的集成物，乡村里的厚砖墙的建筑物（除了教堂及宝塔）都彻底破坏了。道路几乎每隔一米突都用横沟切断。铁路则被搬移到二千公里以外远的地方去。
    为了建立军火工厂，工人在战争爆发时，组织起来，在最艰苦的条件下，将机器和资源搬移到安全的地带。把重到一二吨的铁块用原始的方法从前线通过泥泞与截断的道路，翻山入谷，日以继夜地搬入后方。我们的搬运者们徒步行走几百公里，有时没有足够的米吃。但是，由于他们的自我牺牲，今天每一省至少有一个工厂，每一个地区有一个制造手榴弹及修理来福枪的工厂。
    不用说，在与一个强大的并有良好装备的敌人斗争中，来完成这样的工作，越南的工人是备尝着难以形容的苦痛的。许多的工人已经在战场上或在由于实验军火所发生的意外中牺牲了他们的生命。
    大多数的工人目前是在国有工厂（大部分是军火工厂）里。在那里，他们的生活是非常艰苦的。为了秘密性的原因，军火工厂是设立在离城市极远、离乡村极远的深远的森林里。他们必需经常地迁移，而每一次这种艰苦的运输工作就又得重做一番。食物、衣服及药品的供给是困难的。居住条件经常是有害健康的，因此就增加了由恶劣的气候可产生的疾病。
    然而，随着军事情况的改善，由于政府的关心及越总（越南总工会）在组织上的努力，工人的情况也就在改进着。在国有的工厂里，工人有着较好的生活条件。现在他们在工作中已更加安全，并可获得较好的食物、衣服及药品的供给。在每一个工厂里，包括工人代表在内的企业委员会是与厂长合作的，以便保证工人们的生活和工作条件最好的处理。通过这个企业委员会，工人也可以参加他们工厂里的生产计划的讨论。他们的工会可以经常跟厂长接触和讨论以保障工人的合法权利。凡由于厂长的恶意而发生争执时，工会得向越总较高级机关申诉。较高级的机关就会将案情交由适当的较高级政府官员来检查。越总执行委员会自身是与劳动局密切地合作的。由于政府经常严肃地考虑着工人的合法要求，所以越总至今一直是成功地保卫着工人们的合法要求。
    由于按照工厂所设立的地区之条件的不同，因而各工厂所获得的改善也不同。一般地，工会以或多或少的物质，组织集体的供给服务、集体的厨房、运动场、会议室、阅览室，并组织为提高工人的政治、文化和业务水平的训练科目。在某些工厂里，他们成功地将工人的家庭搬到工厂的邻近，给妇女职业，使儿童有学校和操场。必需说明：由于我们目前没有很大的可能性，所以这些成就仍是小范围的。
    除了那些有战略重要性的工厂外，出产各种货物的一些工厂与作坊正在气候比较好、供给问题比较容易的乡村里建立起来。这些工厂里的工人生活是更加好得多了。
    至于私人企业，由于军事情势，则还是小规模的。每一私人工厂所雇用的工人不超过十人。工会也组织并保护这些工人。然而为了鼓励为供给军队与人民大众所必须的私人企业的发展，还是应当做些让步。
    不顾目前的痛苦与贫困，工人们都热诚地参加着胡志明主席号召的爱国竞赛运动。在各工厂里，生产速度是在增加着。一九四八年，总生产额比上一年增加百分之六十。在第三战区，增加了一倍。一九四七年初，造一个反坦克手榴弹要三十小时，而目前由于新的生产方法，同样的工作只需要三十分钟了。品质方面，也已有了显著的进步。举个例子：不能爆发的手榴弹的生产：从一九四七年的百分之二十已经成功地减低到在一九四八年初百分之八及同年年底的百分之三。
    在敌人暂时占领着的区域里，工人生活则全然不同了。殖民者迫害与剥削的政权在用一切的恐怖复活了起来。在这种政权下工人的待遇比牲畜还不如。商品日趋缺乏、物价不断上涨。总是怀疑工人跟抗战力量可能有联系的，经常向工人进行殖民者式的镇压，这一切使这些地区成为真正的人间地狱。
    由于我们军队封锁敌人的阵地，食料的缺乏愈来愈尖锐。米价比解放的地域里增涨了三倍，水果、蔬菜十倍，柴二十倍。在某些城市里，甚至连取水都困难。举个例子，在河内和海防，工人家庭不得不用泥洼里的水洗濯，有时作烹调之用。
    在橡皮种植园及煤矿里，殖民者使工人一天工作十二小时到十四小时，毫无疑义的这是为了增加他们的利润，但是也是为了阻止工人有时间“搞政治”。敲诈逮捕被用来防止“谋反”的浸入。任意逮捕、拷问、以联络抗战力量的罪名就地执刑的事件是不可胜数的。怠工事件一发生，就成为法国兵来包围工厂区，在每个屋子里搜找妇女与钱钞的良好机会。
    但是，什么也阻止不了工人的心目朝向着解放的地域。相反地，工人的痛苦更密切地使他们与越南民主共和国结合起来，只有越南民主共和国的胜利才能把他们从法国殖民主义的手中解放出来。工人建立了地下组织，直接地与解放的地区及越总保持联系，因为法国殖民者的残暴镇压，为日常利益的公开斗争不是较经常的；但是占领区里的工人正在秘密地执行着一个有耐性的怠工纲领，准备反攻的日子到来时参加并协助军队。
    总结起来，越南工人阶级正在英勇地斗争着，但其政治和组织上的水平仍然是低的。越南工人阶级必需要继续艰苦斗争、多加学习、经历更多的困难与苦痛。不论怎样，它已经选择了正确的目标并取得了正确的道路。这个目标是社会主义；因为只有社会主义才能消灭人对人的剥削。这个道路，在现情况下，即是追随着世界上为争取民主、争取和平的总斗争，来赢得真正的独立和真正的民主。在前进的过程中，越南的工人阶级曾经有过和将要一定有许多缺点和错误。但是，有了以苏联为首的世界民主力量的支持，有了法国工人阶级的援助并有了邻近的中国的援助，越南工人阶级将一定能改正其缺点和错误，克服一切困难，以赢得完全的胜利。（附图片）
