  　Chapter Three: The Tasks and Significance of Political Economy and the Chinese Revolution
    Section One: The Tasks and Significance of Political Economy
    “If one is to subject capitalist economics to the kind of exhaustive criticism outlined above, it is not enough to know the capitalist forms of production, exchange and distribution. One must also investigate and bring into comparison with them the forms which preceded them or exist alongside them in countries which are still underdeveloped. Hitherto this has been done in the main only by Marx, and we owe practically exclusively to his researches all that we know about pre-capitalist theoretical economics.” (Engels, "Anti-Dühring," Part II, Section I)
    Refuting the Distortions of Bukharin and Other Counter-revolutionaries
    Counter-revolutionary Social Democratic "thinkers," Mensheviks, and international fascist spies, such as Hilferding, Rubin, Bukharin, etc., believed that political economy only studies capitalist economics. They believed that political economy is based on commodity production, and the doctrine of social economy is the doctrine of unorganized social economy. Therefore, when capitalist commodity production ends, political economy will also come to an end. However, facts have proven the reactionary nature of this viewpoint, because it has been proven that a socialist society that practices conscious and planned economy also has its principles and laws. It is just that these principles and laws, their content, forms of expression, or their methods of realization, have fundamental differences from the production methods and economic laws of capitalist society. Therefore, political economy is still needed for socialist society. Moreover, in fact, after Lenin's death, under the leadership of Comrade Stalin and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks), the doctrine of socialist political economy has been established in the course of more than 30 years of socialist economic construction. The economic construction of Soviet socialism was established under the guiding principles of Lenin and Stalin on socialist economy and is transitioning to advanced communism. Therefore, understanding and mastering the principles and laws of socialist economy is not only necessary for the working class in Soviet socialist society, but also for the working class and laboring people in Eastern Europe and Chinese New Democratic society. It is also necessary and important for the present and future of the proletariat, laboring people, and other colonial and semi-colonial working class and peasantry in capitalist countries on the verge of final decline. Therefore, the view that there are generally no economic laws in a socialist society and that political economy is not needed is a completely erroneous and reactionary viewpoint. It is merely a deliberate distortion of Marxist political economy by the international fascist spy Bukharin and the counter-revolutionary Social Democrats.
    Section Two: From Bourgeois Political Economy to Marxist-Leninist Political Economy
    Scientific Bourgeois Political Economy – The Classical School
    From the historical development of political economy: bourgeois political economy came first, that is, bourgeois political economy was established before Marxist-Leninist political economy.
    When capital was still in the so-called primitive accumulation period, that is, when the feudal economy was transitioning to the capitalist economy, there were already sprouts of bourgeois political economy. At that time, mercantilist schools had emerged in England and France. The mercantilist school's observation of economic phenomena focused on circulation phenomena, that is, on the circulation of commodities, the circulation of money, and the increase of capital. Later, due to the emergence of wealthy peasants and the wealthy peasant economy, the physiocratic school of France emerged; the emergence of manufacturing produced the English classical school (also called the orthodox school). The physiocratic school differed from the mercantilist school in that it began to pay attention to the analysis of the production process, to agricultural production, and to the agricultural economy, believing that only agriculture was productive, and other industries and commerce were not productive. The English classical school went further, believing that not only was agriculture productive, but industry was also productive. Adam Smith and Ricardo of the classical school were the founders of bourgeois political economy. Because of the era in which they lived, which was the period when capitalism was beginning and growing, and because the class struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat was still in a latent state, the bourgeoisie, in order to develop capitalist production and even the entire capitalist economy, was able to observe and analyze the economic phenomena of capitalist society in a relatively scientific way. That is to say, they did not only observe the economic phenomena of capitalism from the surface, but were able to observe them more deeply and observe the internal connections of various economic phenomena. For example, the classical school's analysis of value and profit was still relatively correct. They recognized that value was determined by labor. Therefore, their theory of value was called the labor theory of value. In addition, the classical school's theory of profit largely referred to surplus value. Although they had not yet put forward the concept of surplus value and still had many errors in their views, the content they analyzed was largely the content of surplus value. Therefore, this analysis was basically more scientific and more correct.
    The Death of the Classical School and the Rise of Vulgar Economics
    However, as the bourgeois economy continued to develop and the class contradictions and class struggles between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat were increasingly exposed, unfolded, and intensified, the scientific political economy of the bourgeois classical school, up to Ricardo, came to an end. Although Ricardo himself was a bourgeois political economist, his labor theory of value also exposed the essence of the bourgeoisie's unearned income and capitalist exploitation. Therefore, his theory was cited by utopian socialists as a theoretical basis to oppose and attack capitalism. The bourgeoisie, aware of this unfavorable situation, abandoned this view of the classical school of bourgeois political economy for its own interests and began to lead political economy down the road of vulgarization, establishing vulgarized bourgeois political economy.
    Vulgarized bourgeois political economy has its fundamental differences from scientific bourgeois political economy. They did not observe economic phenomena more deeply from the internal connections of economic phenomena, but only superficially from some of the surface phenomena of economics, rattling off some of the views of previous political economists that were harmless to the bourgeoisie, forming their so-called political economy—vulgar bourgeois political economy. They deliberately adopted an obscuring view of the class contradictions between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and deliberately adopted a conciliatory view of the class struggle. They used these erroneous views and claims to deceive the proletariat, to make the proletariat docilely serve the bourgeoisie, and to be enslaved and exploited by the bourgeoisie. Since then, scientific bourgeois political economy has declared its death, and vulgar bourgeois political economy has risen in its place. Later, with the further development of the capitalist economy and the further intensification of the class struggle, various schools of vulgar bourgeois political economy emerged in European and American capitalist countries, such as the neo-classical school in Britain, the historical school in Germany, the psychological school in Austria, and the eclectic school in the United States. Later, there was the mathematical school, which used advanced mathematics to explain economic phenomena. After the First World War, there was even the fascist political economy. In Japan, due to the backwardness and congenital deficiencies in the development of capitalism, it did not produce its own political economy. Various schools of bourgeois political economy were imported from Europe and the United States, thus forming a grocery store with a huge collection of foreign goods. All schools of bourgeois political economy were fully available. China, just like the Chinese market, was the tail-end of commodity invasion by capitalist countries. In the process of China's semi-colonization and colonization in the past century, China's immature and weak bourgeoisie, and its political economists, also smuggled in various goods of bourgeois political economy from Europe and the United States, like compradors, and sold them on the Chinese market on a large scale. Therefore, the views of various schools of vulgar political economy from various countries were also fully available in China, occupying the podium of the economics departments of the old Chinese universities.

  　政治经济学的研究对象任务及其特点

  　第三章　政治经济学的任务意义与中国革命
    第一节　政治经济学的任务与意义
    如果要对资本主义经济进行上述完全的批判，那末只知道生产、交换及分配的资本主义的形态是不充分的，还必须对先行于资本主义的形态，和与资本主义形态同时并存但尚未发达的各国至今还存在着的各种形态（至少在其一般的特征），加以概括的研究，并和资本主义形态相比较对照。进行这种研究和比较的，至今大体上只有马克思一人；因此，我们对于资本主义以前理论经济学上至今已经建立起来的知识，几乎全部要归功于马克思的探求。”（恩格斯“反杜林论”第二编第一节）
    对布哈林等反革命的歪曲的驳斥
    反革命的社会民主党“思想家”、孟塞维克与国际法西斯间谍，如希尔法丁、鲁滨、布哈林等，认为政治经济学只是以研究资本主义经济为对象的，他们认为政治经济学是以商品生产为基础的，社会经济的学说是无组织的社会经济的学说，因此到资本主义商品生产终结的时期，政治经济学也就要宣告终结。但事实却证明了这种观点的反动性，因为实际证明了社会主义社会实行有意识、有计划的经济，也是有它的原则和规律存在，只是这些原则规律，它的内容、表现形式、或者它的实现方式，都与资本主义社会的生产方式与经济规律，有着根本的区别，因此政治经济学对于社会主义社会还是需要的。而且事实上列宁死后，在斯大林同志与联共（布）党领导下，在三十余年社会主义经济建设过程中，已经建立了社会主义的政治经济学说，并且苏联社会主义的经济建设，也就是在列宁斯大林对社会主义经济指导原则下建立起来，并正在向高级共产主义发展过渡。因此了解掌握社会主义经济的原则与规律，不但对于苏联社会主义社会里的工人阶级，不仅对于东欧与中国新民主主义社会的工人阶级与劳动人民大众是必要的，即使对于那些生活在濒于最后没落的资本主义各国的无产阶级、劳动人民与其他殖民地半殖民地的工人阶级、农民阶级的现在与将来，也都有着它的必要与重要性。所以认为社会主义社会经济一般地没有什么经济规律，不需要政治经济学的说法，完全是错误反动的观点，只是国际法西斯的间谍布哈林与反革命的社会民主党们对马克思主义政治经济学故意的歪曲而已。
    第二节　由资产阶级的政治经济学到马列主义的政治经济学
    科学的资产阶级政治经济学——古典学派
    从政治经济学发展的历史程序来说：是首先有资产阶级的政治经济学，即资产阶级的政治经济学是先于马列主义的政治经济学而成立的。
    当资本还在所谓原始积蓄的时期，即当封建主义经济向资本主义经济过渡的时期，已有资产阶级政治经济学的萌芽。当时在英法各国已有重商学派的出现。重商学派对经济现象的观察；注重在流通现象，即注重在商品的流通，货币的流通，与资本的增加等等现象上。以后，由于富农与富农经济的出现，产生了法国的重农学派；工场手工业的出现，产生了英国的古典学派（也叫做正统学派）。重农学派与重商学派不同，它开始注意到生产过程的分析，注意到农业生产，注意到农业经济，认为只有农业才是生产的，其他工业，商业都不是生产的，故称为重农学派。英国的古典学派则更进一步，它不但认为农业是生产的，并且认为工业也是生产的。古典学派的亚当·斯密李嘉图等，就是资产阶级政治经济学的创始者。由于他们所处时代，正是资本主义开始和成长的时期，当时资产阶级与无产阶级的阶级斗争尚在潜伏状态，资产阶级为着发展资本主义的生产，以至于整个资本主义经济的发展，对于资本主义社会的经济现象还能够加以比较科学的观察和分析。就是说：他们对于资本主义的经济现象，还不是只从经济的表面现象来观察，而还能比较进一步的深入的加以观察，而观察到各种经济现象的内部关联。例如：古典学派对于价值利润的分析，都还是比较正确的，他们认识到价值是由劳动决定的，因此，他们的价值说，便叫做劳动价值说。此外，古典学派的利润说，其内容大体上是指剩余价值而言的。虽然他们尚未提出剩余价值这个概念，而且还有许多观点上的错误，但是他们所分析的内容，大体上是剩余价值的内容。因此，这种分析，基本上还是比较科学的，比较正确的。
    古典学派的死亡，与庸俗派的兴起
    但是，以后资产阶级的经济继续不断的发展，资产阶级与无产阶级的阶级矛盾，与阶级斗争也随着日益暴露，日益展开，与日益尖锐化，资产阶级古典学派科学的政治经济学，到李嘉图为止，也就宣告寿终正寝。李嘉图本人虽是资产阶级的政治经济学者，但他的劳动价值说，还暴露了资产阶级不劳而获与资本家剥削的实质。因此，他的学说便被空想的社会主义者引用为理论的根据，来反对攻击资本主义。资产阶级有鉴及此，觉得这种情况对自身的不利，因此，为了资产阶级自身的利益，他们就抛弃了古典学派资产阶级政治经济学的这种观点，开始把政治经济学引向庸俗化的道路，建立了庸俗化的资产阶级政治经济学。
    庸俗化的资产阶级政治经济学，与科学的资产阶级政治经济学有它基本的区别。他们不是对经济观察比较进一步的深入的加以观察，从观察经济现象的内部关联出发，而只是肤浅地从经济的一些表面现象出发，拉拉杂杂地罗列了一些经济现象，咀嚼一些以前政治经济学者对资产阶级无害的见解，形成他们所谓的政治经济学——庸俗的资产阶级政治经济学。他们对于无产阶级与资产阶级的阶级矛盾，故意采取了掩蔽的观点，对于阶级斗争故意采取了调和的观点，他们就拿这种谬误的见解和主张，来欺骗无产阶级，要无产阶级驯服地为资产阶级服务，为资产阶级奴役、宰割。自此以后，科学的资产阶级政治经济学遂宣告死亡，庸俗的资产阶级政治经济学乃代之而兴。以后随着资本主义经济的更加发展与阶级斗争的更加尖锐化，欧美资本主义各国便纷纷出现了各种派别的庸俗的资产阶级政治经济学，例如：在英国有新古典学派的出现，德国有历史学派，奥大利有心理学派，在美国有折衷派的出现，再以后复又出现了用高等数学说明经济现象的数理学派，第一次大战后，更有法西斯派的政治经济学出现。在日本由于资本主义发展的后进与先天不足，没有自己的政治经济学产生，资产阶级政治经济学的各派学说，都由欧美输入，因此，形成了一个洋广杂货庞然杂陈的杂货铺，资产阶级政治经济学的各派学说，样样俱全。中国也正如中国市场，是资本主义各国商品侵略的尾闾一样，在近百年来中国半殖民地与殖民地化的过程中，中国幼稚的软弱的资产阶级，及其政治经济学者，也与买办办货一样，从欧美贩进了资产阶级政治经济学的各种货色，在中国市场上大肆贩卖，因此各国的各派的庸俗的政治经济学的观点，在中国也样样俱全，占领着旧中国各大学经济学科的讲台。
