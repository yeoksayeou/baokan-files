　　Beijing Municipal Government Bureaus, Institutes, and Section Chiefs Jointly Office to Discuss Implementing Resolutions of All-Circles Representatives Conference
　　[Beijing News] Yesterday morning (29th), the heads of various bureaus, institutes, and sections of the Beijing Municipal People's Government held a joint office meeting, presided over by Deputy Mayor Zhang Youyu. He reported on the summary of the first meeting of the Second Session of the All-Circles People's Representative Conference's Consultative Committee regarding the conference. He also proposed several issues that the Municipal Government itself should summarize, so that all units of the Municipal Government could immediately begin preparing to implement the resolutions of the Second Session of the All-Circles People's Representative Conference. Apart from resolutions that have already been immediately implemented, such as the resolution on closing brothels, there are still some proposals that should be dealt with immediately, and these should be handled right away. Specific implementation plans for other resolutions should also be presented at the meeting next week. In addition, the seven resolutions from the previous conference that have not yet been implemented should be re-examined, and if they can be implemented in the future, they should be implemented immediately. For those that have been handled but not completed, implementation should continue.
