　　A Little Reminder, A Few Gains
　　Beichizi Elementary School Yi Wen
　　In order to implement the new education policy, strengthen the close connection between school education and families, and run formal national education well, the Beichizi National Elementary School in the Sixth District of Beijing held a parent-teacher conference on November 13th. Parents offered many valuable opinions, reminding us that our teaching methods should be improved.

　　Some parents reminded us: "Teachers should not mechanically encourage students' progress by the number of points (deducting or adding points), but should encourage children's enterprising spirit through concrete exemplary actions and more praise and less criticism." This is very good.

　　Therefore, we feel that this symposium has yielded the following gains:

　　1. Some parents suggested using the "Good Student" movement to guide children's progress, but this still has shortcomings. In the "Good Student" movement we held last time, the following deviation occurred: some good students "did good to be good students." They were very active at school and worked very well, but when they returned home, they became young ladies and young masters, not sweeping the floor or helping with cooking. Therefore, simply encouraging students to progress with the good student method, if the school leadership does not control it well and the meaning of good students is not clear, it may lead to another deviation. Therefore, in order to cultivate children's spirit and habits of collectivism, we should pay more attention to praising the actual actions of "Good Student Model Classes" and use these actions to enhance children's collectivist spirit and promote new collective heroism.

　　2. A more formalized school should also be more scientific and formal in various procedures, and strive to avoid phone calls for leave, so as to avoid abuses.

　　3. Mutual help and friendship in primary schools is a very important political and ideological education. It is essential to cultivate children's spirit and habits of unity and mutual assistance from an early age. It is necessary to constantly advocate that children should help and love teachers and classmates at school, and help and love brothers and sisters at home.

　　In short, the greatest gain is that at this parent-teacher conference, it was unanimously recognized that in order to run national education well, only the close combination of family education and school education, under joint guidance to supervise children's progress, parents and school teachers exchanging opinions anytime and anywhere, and making timely improvements, will make national education achieve better results.

### 一点提醒，几点收获

　　一点提醒，几点收获
    北池子小学  一闻
    为了贯彻新的教育方针，学校教育与家庭取得密切的联系，办好正规的国民教育，北京市六区北池子国民小学曾于十一月十三日召开家长座谈会，家长们提了许多宝贵的意见，提醒了我们教学方法应加改进。
    有的家长提醒我们：“教师不应机械的以分数多少（扣分或增分）去鼓励学生的进步，应以儿童具体的模范行动与多表扬少批评的方法，去鼓励儿童的进取心”。这是很好的。
    因此，这次座谈会，我们觉得有以下几点收获：
    一，有的家长提出了以“好学生”运动的方法去辅导儿童进步，这样还是有缺点的。上次我们所举行的“好学生”运动中，曾发生这样的偏向：有的好学生，为“做好学生而做好学生”，在学校里表现非常积极，劳动也非常好，但回到家后，却变成了小姐、少爷，地也不扫，饭也不帮做，所以说单纯的以好学生方法去鼓励学生进步，如果学校领导上掌握不好，好学生的意义没有弄明确，反而会发生另一种偏向的。所以，为了培养儿童集体主义的精神与习惯，应多注意表扬“好学生模范班”的实际行动，以此行动作为提高儿童集体主义的进取心，发扬新的集体的新英雄主义。
    二、一个比较正规化的学校，应在各种手续上也要比较科学与正规，竭力避免电话请假，以免流弊。
    三、小学校的互助友爱是一个很重要的政治思想教育，使儿童自小养成团结互助的精神与习惯，必须时刻提倡儿童在校对师长同学要互助友爱，在家对兄弟姊妹要互助友爱。
    总之，一个最大的收获，是这次的家长会上，一致认识为了办好国民教育，只有家庭教育与学校教育密切的结合，在共同辅导下督促儿童进步，家长与学校老师随时随地的交换意见，及时的加以改进，才会使国民教育得到更好的效果。
