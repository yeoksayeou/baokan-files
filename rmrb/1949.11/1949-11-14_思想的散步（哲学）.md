    Thoughts on a Stroll (Philosophy)
    Huang Yaomian
  I.
    Philosophy is not the property of philosophers, nor is it a commodity of capitalist society. Philosophy is also not just a knife, as some philosophers say, to dissect the myriad, complex, and fluctuating phenomena to find its roots and essence. No, philosophy must not only be able to generalize complex and fluctuating phenomena into a law, but also concretize these systems and laws into more complex and manageable phenomena. Therefore, philosophy is also an art.
  II.
    When you embody your philosophical ideas into a policy and move it in the practical action of transforming the world, you may see many diverse phenomena and different characters revolving around your policy. At this time, you will definitely feel the joy of a philosopher, the most sublime joy.
  III.
    You must be careful; the books on the bookshelf may turn into devils! They will tempt you in gorgeous clothes, they will pretend to be solemn and righteous to scare you, and they will play with you by chanting incantation-like words. If you follow them wholeheartedly, you will definitely be fooled. And, one day, these books will force you to compile them into a funeral procession to send you to the grave. Only when you hold the wisdom of the masses tightly in your hands and stride into the study, only at this time, will those books crawl on the ground and become your most docile servants.
  IV.
    Philosophers should be diligent workers. They must constantly ruminate on objective reality like a cow, repeatedly chewing it over and over again, seeking its meaning in this repeated chewing. Therefore, philosophy is a guest that lazy people can never know.
  V.
    The philosopher's mind is broad. Because he can put the entire universe in his arms and calculate the future history on his fingers, he can unify the contradictions that should be unified at that time, no matter how complex and intricate they are, in his soul. And because he can feel the light and heat in the distant future, even in the most tragic setbacks, he can still radiate enthusiasm to warm others, and respond to the boring scolding with a compassionate smile.
  VI.
    Have you ever seen an orchestral conductor? Before conducting, he has already thoroughly read the entire score and understood the spirit of the entire score, so when conducting, he can make people feel the harmony and joy of ups and downs and pauses. Drumming when it is time to drum, and playing the flute when it is time to play the flute. But those who do not understand art music are so pitiful! When it is the drummer's turn to drum, the flute player sighs at his loneliness. When it is the flute player's turn to play the flute, the drummer complains about his neglect. Those who are afraid of loneliness, go listen to an orchestra more often, it will definitely reduce your narrow mental illness a little. Otherwise, can you still expect the orchestral conductor to play all the instruments together?
  VII.
    Mistakes are often the lame companions of truth. Sometimes it always hides shyly behind the truth. At this time, you should still forgive it. Just greet it with a shout: "I have already seen you. Please come out and bask in the sun." As the truth grows day by day, it may naturally disappear like a shadow. Otherwise, it will develop, or because it sees that someone forgives it, it will gradually become presumptuous, even baring its teeth and claws. At this time, you can strike it with a stick, even if it is killed, people will not sigh, but will feel happy about it.
  VIII.
    Contemplation is good. But if your contemplation only slides over the surface of things and floats up, then your thoughts will become like the shadows of uncertain objects. Only when your thoughts have penetrated into matter can you build a palace of thought.
  IX.
    Have you ever had a scientific premonition? When you see those events really coming as you expected, you will definitely raise your arms and cheer to him: "You really came!"
  X.
    This is a test for philosophers. If, when he thinks, his thoughts jump around on the tree of principles and systems like a bird, then he will definitely fly into the clouds in the future. Only when he thinks, and many specific events rush to his eyes, then his thinking has at least stepped on the soil.
  XI.
    But philosopher, don't be proud. You are not a magician who can show off your skills. Only when your policies are the crystallization of the highest wisdom of the people, then you can have the power to reverse the universe.

    思想的散步（哲学）
    黄药眠
  一、
    哲学，并不是哲学家的财产，更不是资本主义社会的商品，哲学也不只是一把刀子，如某些哲学家所说，用他来把千头万绪，错综复杂，变化起伏的事象，解剖开来，去找寻出它的根源和本质。不，哲学不仅要能把错综复杂，变化起伏的事象概括成为一种法则，而且同时还要把这些体系和法则具体化成为更复杂，更听人指挥的事象。所以哲学同时又是一种艺术。
  二、
    当你把你的哲学思想，具现化成为一种政策，在改造世界的实际行动中运动的时候，你也许可能看到许多五花八门的现象，各种不同的人物，在围绕着你的政策来转动。这个时候，你一定会感觉到哲学家的喜悦，最崇高的喜悦。
  三、
    你要当心；书架上的书都可能变成魔鬼啊！它会穿着华丽的衣服来诱惑你们，它会装出庄严的道貌来吓唬你们，它会念着符咒般的言语来玩弄你们。如果你一心跟着它走，那就一定会上当了。而且，总有一天，这些书会硬迫着你要把它们自已编成送葬的行列，将你送进坟墓。只有当你把群众的智慧紧握在手中，跨开大步走进书斋里去，只有在这个时候，那些书才会匐伏在地下，成为了你的最驯伏的奴仆。
  四、
    哲学家应该是勤劳的工作者，他要象牛的反刍一样，不断的把客观的现实加以反复的咀嚼，在这样的反复咀嚼中找寻出它的意义。所以哲学乃是懒汉们永远不能认识的客人。
  五、
    哲学家的胸怀是博大的。因为他能够把整个宇宙都放在他的怀抱里面，把未来的历史都算在他的手指上，所以他能够把当时所应该统一的，不管是怎样复杂错综的矛盾，都统一在他的灵魂里面。而且因为他能够感觉到未来远景中的光和热，所以即使是在最悲惨的挫败中，他也还能够放射出热情去温暖别人，而对于那无聊的漫骂，报以悲悯的微笑。
  六、
    你曾看见过管弦乐的指挥者吗？他在指挥之前，早就把整个乐谱都熟读了，整个乐谱的精神都了解了，所以指挥起来，能够使人感到起伏，顿挫的调和快乐。该打鼓时候打鼓，该吹笛的时候吹笛。可是不懂得艺术音乐的人却真可怜！轮到打鼓的人打鼓的时候，吹笛者却感叹着自己的寂寞，轮到吹笛的人吹笛的时候，打鼓者却又埋怨着自己的冷落。怕寂寞的人，你去多听一次管弦乐罢，它一定可以使你的狭隘的精神病减轻一些的。不然，你还能够希望管弦乐的指挥者，把所有的乐器都一齐鸣奏起来么？
  七、
    错误，常常是真理的跛脚的伙伴，它有时老是怕羞似的遮遮掩掩的躲在真理的后面，在这个时候，你还是原谅它罢，你只招呼它一声：“我已经看见你了。请你出来晒晒太阳啊。”真理一天天长大起来，也许它自然会象阴影般消逝的。不然，它就会发展起来，或因为看见有人原谅它，而逐渐放肆起来，甚而至张牙舞爪起来，到了这个时候，你就一棒打过去罢，即使是打死了，人们也不会叹息，倒反而会引以为痛快了。
  八、
    沉思是好的。但如果你的沉思，只是从事物的表面滑过去，浮了起来，那你的思想，就会成为了仿佛不定的物体的阴影。只有当你的思想都渗透到物质里面去的时候，你才能够建立起思想底殿堂。
  九、
    你曾有过科学的预见吗？当你看见那些事象真的如你所预料的来临的时候，你一定会举起来向他欢呼说：“你果然来了！”
  十、
    这是对哲学家的一种考验。如果当他思索的时候，他的思想象小鸟般在原则和体系底树上跳来跳去，那它将来是一定会飞到云堆里去的。只有当他思索的时候，许多多具体的事象都奔赴到他的眼前，那时候他的思维至少已踏在泥土上了。
  十一、
    但哲学家，你不要骄傲啊。你不是魔术家，可以逞自己的技巧，只有当你的政策是人民大众的最高智慧的结晶，那时候，你才能够有旋乾转坤的力量。
              一九四九、十一、一日
