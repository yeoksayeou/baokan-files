    Northern Jiangsu Administrative Office's Dananzhuang Warehouse
    Huge Losses Suffered in Arson Attack by Bandit Agents
    Ideological Paralysis and Lax Fire Prevention Responsible for Disastrous Results
    [This newspaper dispatch] The Dananzhuang Warehouse of the Northern Jiangsu Administrative Office suffered a devastating arson attack by special agents due to lax leadership and negligence of duty by management cadres, resulting in a tragedy and enormous losses. The warehouse was under the leadership of the Transportation Section of the Industry and Commerce Department of the Administrative Office's Trade Department. This summer, the Trade and Management Department cleared the warehouse, gradually transporting the stored materials and equipment to Taizhou and Shanggang District, Yancheng County. A portion of the equipment remained in the Dananzhuang warehouse of Shanggang District, and had yet to be completely moved. At 4:00 AM on August 6th, a fire suddenly broke out in the warehouse. By the time it was discovered and attempts were made to extinguish it, the fire had already spread significantly. The warehouse director, Sun Boxiang, produced a fire extinguisher, but was unable to operate it and failed to put out the fire. The fire then spread to another warehouse next door, which was also consumed. Storekeeper Liu Guangping bravely attempted to salvage goods, sacrificing his life in the process. The incident resulted in massive losses, estimated at 44 million yuan, equivalent to 240 taels of gold, resulting in the deaths of one storekeeper and two residents, injuries to twenty people, and the destruction of 250 houses. Following the incident, the Yancheng Military Subdistrict and the Northern Jiangsu Administrative Office dispatched personnel to handle the situation and carry out relief work. After more than a month of investigation, the Northern Jiangsu District Committee of the CCP and the Northern Jiangsu Administrative Office identified the responsible parties, and pointed out that the cause of the accident was primarily due to the serious paralysis, complacency, and bureaucratic work style of the leadership from top to bottom, which relaxed specific education and deployment regarding guarding against traitors and special agents, allowing the bandit agents to take advantage and carry out sabotage. Secondly, there were serious shortcomings in the administrative management of the warehouse, such as the person in charge of the Transportation Section, Huang Yaquan, who was perfunctory and irresponsible in his work, causing the transportation work to not be completed early. Warehouse management was also extremely careless and lax, with windows left open, damaged doors not repaired, and usually no attention paid to fire prevention and anti-special agent education. Only one fire extinguisher was available, and no one had learned how to use it. In order to strictly enforce discipline, improve warehouse work, and educate cadres, the Northern Jiangsu Administrative Office made a decision to severely punish those responsible for the incident. The Northern Jiangsu District Committee and the leadership of the Administrative Office also made a public self-criticism for the serious bureaucratic style of work and paralysis of thought that existed on this issue, and the irresponsible attitude toward the property of the people and the motherland.

    苏北行署大南庄仓库
    遭匪特纵火损失巨大
    思想麻痹防火松懈造成恶果
    【本报讯】苏北行署大南庄仓库，因领导思想麻痹疏忽，管理干部马虎渎职，遭特务纵火焚烧造成血案，损失巨大。该库属行署工商处贸易处保运科领导。今夏，贸管处清理仓库，将所存各项物资器材等分别陆续运往泰州，盐城县上岗区大南庄仓库尚余部分未运完器材。八月六日晨四时该库突然起火，经发觉抢救时火势已大。仓库主任孙伯祥虽拿出灭火器，因不会使用，没有打出。后火蔓延到隔壁另一仓库，该库随亦被焚。保管员刘广平奋勇抢救而致牺牲。此事件损失巨大，计值四千四百万元，折合黄金二百四十两，炸死保管员一人、居民二人、伤二十人，炸毁房子二百五十间。事件发生后，盐城军分区、苏北行署即派人前往处理，并进行善后工作。中共苏北区党委及苏北行署经月余调查，究明责任，指出此次失事原因，首先是由于领导上从上到下存在着严重的麻痹思想、太平观念与官僚主义作风，放松对防奸防特的具体教育与布置，使匪特有机可乘，进行破坏。其次是仓库行政管理上存在严重缺点，如保运科负责人黄亚泉，工作态度敷衍塞责，致使搬运工作未能及早完成。仓库管理上亦极马虎松懈，窗户洞开，门板损坏不加修理，平时对防火防特教育尤不注意，仅有一个灭火机，亦未学会使用。为严整纪律，改善仓库工作，教育干部，苏北行署并作出决定分别严厉处罚此次事件失职人员。苏北区党委及行署领导上，因在这一问题上存在着较严重的官僚主义与麻痹思想，和对人民祖国财产不负责的态度，亦作公开的自我批评。
