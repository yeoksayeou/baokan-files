Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 12th: TASS, Moscow - Pravda published an editorial on the 9th entitled "Vanguard in the Struggle for Peace, Democracy and Socialism," stating:

    The celebration of the 32nd anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution vividly demonstrates the international prestige of the Soviet Union and the inseparable connection between socialist countries and the working people and all peace-loving people of the world. The Soviet Union is strengthening and developing, and the forces of democracy and socialism throughout the world are growing stronger. On the other hand, the forces of capitalism and warmongers are declining. This is the conclusion that must be drawn from the current development of the international situation.

    Thanks to the victory of the Chinese people, the People's Democracies of Europe and Asia, together with the Soviet Socialist countries, now have about 800 million people. In capitalist and colonial countries, hundreds of millions of working people are waging struggles for peace and democracy.

    The camp of peace and democracy has become a powerful factor in all international affairs. The great socialist country has always led this camp. Since its birth in October 1917, it has consistently supported the strong friendship between all nations, large and small.

    The Soviet Union's foreign policy is very clear. The Soviet Union advocates peace and safeguards the cause of peace. The Soviet government is faithful to its firm and unwavering policy of peace. Throughout the post-war period, the Soviet Union has supported a plan that, if implemented, would greatly strengthen peace and international security. This plan stipulates cooperation among the major powers. It calls for condemning the new war preparations being carried out by the United States and Britain and their "partners," demanding that the five major powers conclude a pact to strengthen peace, demanding an unconditional ban on atomic weapons, demanding the implementation of the Potsdam decisions on the German question, and demanding a peace treaty with Japan.

    If this plan, which conforms to the basic interests of all mankind, is not implemented, the only reason is that it does not suit the appetites of the warmongers. American imperialists are striving to establish an American world empire through violence and new wars, an empire whose scope and scale will surpass all world empires established by any conqueror in the past.

    American imperialists are stubbornly moving towards war, engaging in atomic blackmail, and engaging in various international adventures and provocations. But if American imperialism succeeds in its vile schemes, then, undoubtedly, the Third World War will not only dig the graves for individual capitalist countries, but will dig the graves for the entire capitalist system in the world. American imperialists should not harbor the illusion that they will be able to use the people of the nations of Europe and Asia as cannon fodder to fight outside the American continent. The "simple people" of America are beginning to realize more and more that if the warmongers plunge the people into a new slaughter, then the American continent will also have weeping mothers, wives, sisters, and children, a terrible sorrow, which the warmongers will inevitably be suffocated and drowned by.

    Under the feet of American imperialists, the earth is shaking. In the United States, signs of the beginning of an economic crisis are becoming more and more apparent. The contradictions within the Anglo-American imperialist bloc are deepening.

    Let us compare this bleak reality of the warmongers' camp with the situation in the camp of peace and democracy.

    In a short period of time, the People's Democratic countries have victoriously moved forward along the road of socialist construction. In terms of the richness of the content of their transformation work, the breadth of its scope, and the significance and importance of the achievements made, the short period of time has been equal to decades.

    The imperialists are annoyed by those countries that refuse to kneel before the American billionaires, and they are intensifying their subversive activities against them. But imperialism is suffering one defeat after another. The trial of the Rajk-Tito spy center organization in Budapest was a terrible blow to imperialist conspiracies.

    The establishment of the peace-loving German Democratic Republic is a turning point in European history. The existence of a peace-loving Germany side by side with a peace-loving Soviet Union is a strong guarantee of peace in Europe.

    The victory of the Chinese people is of epoch-making importance for consolidating the cause of peace. Everyone knows that the American ruling clique placed reactionary Kuomintang China in a special position in their post-war aggression plans. But the American imperialists miscalculated, and their plans failed. The Chinese People's Revolution has proved to be immeasurably stronger than China's feudal forces and the reactionary aggressive bloc of American imperialism. The victory of Chinese democracy greatly strengthens the position of the world's democratic camp in the struggle for lasting peace and the security of all countries.

    In response to the conspiracies of the imperialist aggressors, the powerful camp of peace is becoming increasingly closely united around the great Soviet Union - the standard-bearer of the new era.

    The Soviet people fully understand their historical responsibility, they spare no effort to consolidate the cause of peace, and they show progressive mankind an unwavering example in the struggle against the warmongers and their hidden and open agents.

    Under the brilliant leadership of our leader and teacher Comrade Stalin, the camp of peace, democracy and socialism, headed by the great Soviet Union, faces tomorrow with confidence. We firmly believe that the victory of socialism and democracy is inevitable.

    争取和平民主与社会主义的前锋
    【新华社北京十二日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报于九日以“争取和平民主与社会主义的前锋”为题发表社论称：
    伟大的十月社会主义革命三十二周年的庆祝，生动地表明了苏联的国际威信，和社会主义国家与全世界劳动人民及一切爱好和平的人民之间的不可分割的联系。苏联在增强和发展着，全世界民主与社会主义的力量在发展壮大着。另一方面，资本主义和战争贩子的力量却正在衰退着。这就是必须从目前国际情况发展中得到的结论。
    由于中国人民的胜利，欧洲与亚洲的人民民主国家和苏维埃社会主义国家一起，就拥有八亿左右的人民。在资本主义与殖民地国家里，有数以亿计的劳动人民正进行争取和平与民主的斗争。
    和平与民主阵营，已成为一切国际事务中的强有力的因素。伟大的社会主义国家一直领导着这一阵营。它从一九一七年十月诞生以后，即始终不渝地拥护一切大小民族之间的坚强友谊。
    苏联的外交政策是非常明确的。苏联拥护和平并维护和平的事业。苏联政府忠于其坚定不移的和平政策。在整个战后时期中，苏联都拥护这样一个计划，如果履行了这一计划，则将大大地加强和平与国际安全。这一计划规定了各大国之间的合作。它要求斥责美国与英国及其“伙友”所正在进行的新战争准备，要求五大国缔结加强和平的公约，要求无条件地禁止原子武器，要求履行关于德国问题的波茨坦决定，并要求对日缔和。
    如果这个符合全人类基本利益的计划不付诸实行，那么，唯一的理由就是因为它不投战争贩子的胃口。美帝国主义者正力求通过暴行和新战争，去建立美利坚世界帝国，其范围与规模将超过过去任何征服者所建立起来的一切世界帝国。
    美帝国主义者正顽固地走向战争，从事原子欺诈和不惜进行各种国际冒险与挑衅。但如果美帝国主义成功地完成了它的卑鄙诡计，那么，无疑地，第三次世界大战将不是为个别的资本主义国家挖掘坟墓，而是为世界上整个资本主义制度挖掘坟墓。美帝国主义者不要抱着这种幻想，即他们将能够利用欧亚各民族人民充当炮灰，在美洲大陆以外作战。美国“朴实的人民”正开始越来越知道，如果战争贩子将人民投入新的屠杀，那么美洲大陆也将有哭泣的母亲、妻子、姊妹和孩子，这是一个可怕的哀伤，战争贩子将不可避免地为这种哀伤所窒息、所淹没。
    在美帝国主义者的脚下，大地在动摇着。在美国，经济危机开始的征候正愈来愈多。美英帝国主义集团内部的矛盾正日益深刻化。
    我们把战争贩子阵营的这种暗淡的现实与和平、民主阵营的情况来比较一下。
    人民民主国家在短时期之内，业已胜利地沿着社会主义建设的道路迈进。就它们的转化工作内容之丰富和范围之广来说，就所获成就具有的意义及其重要性之大来说，年代虽短，但已经等于几十年了。
    帝国主义者恼怒那些不肯在美国的亿万富豪面前屈膝的国家，并对它们加紧进行颠覆性活动。但是，帝国主义正在遭受着一个接着一个的失败。布达佩斯的拉伊克——铁托特务中心组织——审判案，便是对帝国主义阴谋的一个可怕的打击。
    爱好和平的德意志民主共和国的成立，是欧洲历史的转折点。爱好和平的德意志与爱好和平的苏联的并肩存在，是欧洲和平的强固的保证。
    中国人民的胜利，对巩固和平事业具有划时代的重要性。大家知道，美国统治集团在它们战后的侵略计划中曾把反动的国民党中国安置在一个特殊的地位上。但是，美帝国主义者盘算错了，他们的计划失败了。中国人民革命已经证明比中国的封建势力与美帝国主义者的反动侵略集团要强大得不可估量。中国民主的胜利，大大地加强着为持久和平与各国安全而斗争的全世界民主阵营的阵地。
    为了回答帝国主义侵略者的阴谋，强大的和平阵营正在日益紧密地团结在伟大的苏联——新时代的旗手的周围。
    苏联人民完全了解他们对历史的责任，他们为巩固和平事业丝毫不吝惜他们的力量与努力，而且，在反对战争贩子及其隐蔽的和公开的代理人的斗争中，向进步人类显示出坚忍不拔的榜样。
    在我们的领袖与导师斯大林同志的天才领导下，以伟大的苏联为首的和平、民主与社会主义阵营，满怀信心地面向明天。我们坚信，社会主义与民主的胜利是无法避免的。
