Shanxi Farmer Representatives Come to Beijing to Order Large Quantities of Agricultural Machinery
[Our Newspaper] More than 120 labor heroes and farmer representatives from Shanxi Province who came to Beijing for a visit, have been actively ordering agricultural machinery from the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory since they visited the factory on the 18th of this month. In the past few days, they have ordered three 5-inch irrigation water pumps (including sluice gates, bases, and pipes), six Liberation-style weeding hoes, five corn threshers, four chaff cutters, and dozens of other agricultural machines, as well as three 15-horsepower engines from the Agricultural Machinery Branch Factory. The workers at the factory were very excited to see the farmer representatives coming to order goods and personally tested each piece of agricultural machinery they ordered, and presented the representatives with a set of repair tools. When testing the water pump, the water in the pool and the water pump had frozen into ice because of the cold weather. Workers such as Zhou Defu immediately broke the ice and conducted accurate tests. The workers all said: "We must be responsible to the farmers, and no bad machines will leave the factory. We cannot allow farmers to use machines with even the slightest defect. We also have to teach them how to use them." Now, in order to make it easier for the farmer representatives to transport the machinery, the workers are packing it for them. (Agricultural Machinery General Factory Communications Group)

　　来京山西农民代表大批订购农业机械
    【本报讯】山西省来京参观的劳动英雄和农民代表一百二十余人，自本月十八日参观华北农业机械总厂后，纷纷到该厂订购农业机械。数日来已订购五英寸灌溉水泵（连闸门、底座、和管子）三部，解放式耘锄六部，玉米脱粒机五部，铡草机四部及其他各种农业机械十数部，并在农业机械一分厂订购十五马力发动机三部。该厂工人看见农民代表来订货，都非常兴奋的把所订购的每一件农业机械亲手加以试验，并且赠送代表一份修理工具。在试水泵时，因为天冷，水池和水泵里的水都冻成了冰。工人周德富等立即把冰打开，进行了准确的试验。工人们都说：“我们对农民要负责到底，不好的机器不出厂，有一点毛病不能给农民使用。我们还要教会他们如何使用。”现在工人同志为了农民代表容易搬运，正在为他们装箱。（农械总厂通讯组）
