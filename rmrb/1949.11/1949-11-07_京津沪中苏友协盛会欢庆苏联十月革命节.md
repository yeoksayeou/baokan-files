　　Beijing News: The Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association held a grand celebration for the 32nd anniversary of the October Revolution at the National Grand Theater yesterday (the 6th) at 8 p.m. Over 1,200 people attended to celebrate the festival, including Soviet expatriates in Beijing, and representatives from the capital's troops, factories, schools, organizations, and groups, as well as the Soviet Acting Consul General in Beijing, Xie Liejin, Colonel Military Attaché Tuobuluowen, Vice Presidents of the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Wang Zhixiang, Xu Deheng, Liu Ren, Xiao Ming, and others. The meeting began with the solemn and majestic national anthems of China and the Soviet Union. First, Xu Deheng, Chairman and Vice President of the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, delivered the opening speech. He pointed out that the Soviet Union is not only a bulwark of world peace, but also the only path for peace-loving people in the world. Therefore, we must follow the path of the Soviet Union. We must learn the fighting spirit of the Soviet Union, the patriotism of the Soviet people, and the construction spirit of the Soviet people. Then, Liu Ren, Vice President of the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, spoke, saying: The Chinese people only found the true, revolutionary, and liberating path for themselves after the October Revolution. This path is the path of Marxism-Leninism. The victory of the Chinese revolution today is inseparable from the friendship and help of the Soviet Union and its people. The friendship and cooperation between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union will be conducive to the construction of the new China. Today, we will not only celebrate the increasing development of socialist construction in the Soviet Union, but also take the great experience of the Soviet Union in building the country as our example to learn from. The friendship and cooperation between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union will be conducive to the cause of world people striving for peace and democracy. The Chinese people will certainly consolidate the friendship and cooperation between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union as a guarantee for consolidating world peace and the anti-imperialist front. Soviet Acting Consul General in Beijing, Xie Liejin, took the stage to speak amidst warm applause from the audience. He explained that the Soviet Union has set a good example for the world with its continuous progress and success, inspiring their revolutionary spirit and reducing their difficulties in the cause of liberation. He believes that the hundreds of millions of Chinese people who have overcome the reactionary forces of imperialism, domestic feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and achieved a historically significant victory by creating their own People's Republic, have made a huge contribution to the world revolution. After the speech, the audience passed a congratulatory telegram in the name of the meeting to Marshal Stalin of the Soviet Union (see another item). Finally, everyone enthusiastically cheered "Long live Sino-Soviet friendship!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live Marshal Stalin!" and other slogans, and showed movies such as "May Day Parade."

In the future, our construction must also follow the path of the Soviet Union and learn from the Soviet Union with humility and sincerity." Soviet Acting Consul General in Tianjin, Jiduofu, representative of the Soviet Foreign Cultural Association, then spoke. He said: "The great October Socialist Revolution is like a powerful alarm bell, shaking the whole universe. It tells people that mankind has begun a new era, and this new century is the era of the total collapse of capitalist rule and the creation of a new socialist society. Now we have personally witnessed the victory of the 475 million great Chinese people in the new China, which confirms the prediction made by the great Stalin in 1924 regarding the Chinese revolutionary movement."
