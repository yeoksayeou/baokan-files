What is Learning?
    Ěr Chóng
    For those who can read, learning definitely involves reading books, but reading is not the entirety of learning. Being able to recite the articles of Marxism-Leninism without being able to use the Marxist-Leninist standpoint, viewpoint, and method to handle practical problems means that learning has not been done well. Chairman Mao and Comrade Liu Shaoqi have both given instructions on this point. Therefore, we should not measure learning achievements by the number of books read, but should examine learning achievements from the progress of thought and action.
    Learning is not for showing off, displaying erudition, or completing the plans of superiors; it is to improve one's own ideological understanding, so that in revolutionary work, one becomes a soldier who is good at using Marxism-Leninism. Therefore, the Party has repeatedly taught us to combine theory with practice; in a word, it is to use the Marxism-Leninist spirit that has been learned as a weapon to handle practical problems, analyze practical problems, and achieve the goal of transforming reality.
    Learning cannot just be rote learning, which can only fill oneself with dogmas; nor can it be just collecting and accumulating various phenomena, which can only give oneself various narrow experiences; instead, one should use the Marxist-Leninist theoretical standpoint, viewpoint, and method accumulated by predecessors to analyze and summarize real things: concentrate the scattered, find newborn and developing things in the old things; discard the phenomenal and grasp the essential; discard the secondary and grasp the primary; ... in this way, achieve removing the false and retaining the true, distinguishing right from wrong, and being able to act correctly.
    Therefore, reading should involve using one's brain and constantly analyzing the things one encounters. When studying anti-empiricism, many comrades who have not done leadership work say, "We don't have empiricism, we can't examine it!" Actually, that is not the case. Empiricist thinking exists in the minds of many people. Comrades who are used to writing mimeographs with Hori wax paper always think that this kind of wax paper is good, even if there is a new type of wax paper that is better than Hori wax paper, they are unwilling to believe it. When the quartermaster hears that everyone wants to eat green vegetables, he always gives everyone green vegetables, regardless of changes in everyone's appetite... These are also empiricist thinking, which cannot be appreciated without analysis and research.
    The dogmatic learning method is to work hard to remember articles and phrases, preparing to move them around. The empiricist learning method is to accumulate many phenomena in the process of struggle without criticism; when opposing dogmatism, this approach can easily be mistaken for being very practical, but it is not. In the real struggle, the essence of various phenomena and things is always a synthesis of contradictions, that is to say, in a work, there are always advantages and disadvantages. The empiricist learning method without analysis is to pick up things at hand, how are the advantages, how are the disadvantages, plus a sentence "Overall, the achievements are the main thing." This kind of summary is useless for guiding work and transforming reality, because even he himself does not know the fundamental problems and development direction of reality at this stage. This is one type. Another is to emphasize a certain aspect of the problem, then try to collect materials that fit this aspect and pile them up to prove the correctness of this aspect; things on the other aspect are discarded as if they do not exist, forming a one-sided display. The phenomenon of blind obedience in learning mostly appears in this form. For example, when the Party proposes anti-rightism, he will stretch out his hand and pull in many rightist manifestations; when anti-leftism, of course, he can also easily pull in many leftist phenomena, but he himself does not understand the position and essence represented by this left or right in reality. This kind of learning is useless to oneself and others. There is also a practice of measuring things with mathematical algorithms, pulling in several positive phenomena and several negative phenomena, and taking the side with more items as correct, which is also wrong.
    Dogmatic learning is easy to recognize. Empiricist learning, because it often wears a coat similar to reality, is easily mistaken for being very practical.
    From one's own perspective, learning is a constant ideological struggle in the heart, and the ideological struggle is a struggle against non-proletarian consciousness, which mainly requires establishing a correct standpoint, viewpoint, and method of thinking. Corruption and not doing work are wrong. This kind of incorrect thinking is easy to discover, but many biases in work—especially comrades who appear to be working actively—are the most difficult to discover. If this step cannot be achieved, the Party's true progress will not be easily achieved. A calm and patient attitude in learning is based on a scientific and objective attitude. Only those who can treat things with a high sense of responsibility to the Party and the class, regardless of their own gains and losses, can calmly treat problems and avoid them because there are things in them that contradict their own subjective. Learning with an open mind is being actively responsible to the Party and the people. Only by understanding this can one willingly be a primary school student in front of the people, be willing to listen to progressive opinions, and also listen to backward opinions or opinions that contradict one's own subjective wishes, and not be self-righteous and think oneself clever; he truly understands that not being open-minded and having prejudices is not only harming oneself, but more importantly, harming the cause of the Party; he understands the spirit of the saying "Rivers and seas do not choose small streams, so they can become deep; Mount Tai does not reject soil, so it can become high"; he does not limit learning to opposing incorrect phenomena, but pursues opposing incorrect viewpoints, standpoints and methods.
    Many people regard discussion as "restating it again," or extending around a topic, or quibbling over words. Many relatively "smart" people are unwilling to listen to the chaotic discussions of the masses, thinking that it is better to free up time to think more and read more useful books. These views are incorrect. The correct view should regard discussion as the masses' analysis of the problem, participating in the discussion is participating in the analysis, and at the same time being analyzed by the masses; everyone should be prepared to receive education from the masses during the discussion process. However, these mass analyses are sometimes rough, sometimes detailed, sometimes more correct, and sometimes less correct. Cross-referencing and comparative analysis can lead to a more complete understanding. Real discussion is not limited to discussion meetings, but mainly consciously and constantly researching one's own opinions with the masses, not being satisfied with one's own existing views; feeling uneasy if one does not talk to others more and listen to more extensive opinions. A person who is good at learning must be good at discussing with the masses.
    Learning requires thinking, but thinking is not sitting in a room and imagining, but connecting with the masses, connecting with various materials, and constantly expanding the scope of thinking with the help, enlightenment, and criticism of the masses. Staying in a room, guarding the Party's policies and regulations, not contacting the masses, and not actively relying on the thinking of the masses is empty, subjective, useless thinking, which is metaphysical ghost thinking.

　　什么叫做学习？
    尔重
    有阅读能力的人，学习一定要读书，但读书不等于全部的学习。能背诵马列主义的条文，而不能运用马列主义的立场观点方法处理实际问题，那就是没有做好学习。这一点，毛主席、刘少奇同志都指示过了。所以，我们不应该把念书的数目来衡量学习的成绩，而应从思想行动的进步去检查学习成绩。
    学习不是为了哗众取宠、显示博学，也不是为完成上级计划；而是为了提高自己的思想认识，使自己在革命工作中，成为一个善于运用马列主义的战士。所以，党一再教导我们把理论与实践相结合，一句话，就是要把已经学到的马列主义精神，当为武器去处理实际问题，分析实际问题，达到改造现实的目的。
    学习不能只是死读书，那只能使自己装满了教条；也不能是只检取各种事物的现象堆累起来，那只能给自己各种各样的狭隘经验；而应该是用前人集累下来的、马列主义理论的立场、观点、方法，去分析、总结现实的事物：把零碎的集中起来，在旧的事物堆中寻找新生的、发展的事物；把现象的抛开，把握本质的；把次要的抛开，把握主要的；……这样达到去伪存真，分清是非，能够正确的行动。
    所以，读书要用脑筋，要随时分析自己所遇到的事物。在学习反对经验主义时，有许多没有做过领导工作的同志，说是“我们没有经验主义，检讨不出来！”其实不然，经验主义的思想，在许多人的思想中是存在的。写油印的同志用惯了崛井腊纸，思想上总以为这种腊纸好，那怕实际上有了一种新腊纸，质量比崛井的还好，他也不愿相信。当司务长听说大家要吃青菜，便老给大家青菜吃，不顾大家胃口的变化……，这些一样地是经验主义思想，不分析、不研究是不能体会到的。
    教条主义的学习方法是下功夫记条文词句，准备搬运。经验主义的学习方法是把斗争过程中的许多现象，毫无批判地堆起来；在反对教条主义时，这种做法很容易被人误认为很切合实际，其实不然。在现实斗争中，各种现象、各种事物本质，总是矛盾的综合，就是说在一件工作中，永远有优点，也有缺点，不加分析的经验主义的学习方法，就是顺手拈来，优点如何如何，缺点如何如何，再加一句“总起来看，成绩是主要的”。这种总结，对指导工作、改造现实是没有用处的，因为连他自己也不知道现实发展在现阶段的根本问题和发展方向，这是一种。再就是为了强调问题的某一方面，便尽量收集合乎这方面的材料，堆起来，以证明这一方面的正确；把另一方面的东西当为不存在的东西扔掉，形成片面的发挥，学习中的盲从现象，多半以这种形式出现。例如当党提出反右倾时，他便会一伸手把许多右的表现拉来，反左倾时，当然也就可以顺手把许多左的现象拉来，但这种左或右，在现实中所占的地位和所代表的本质如何，他自己也不了解。这种学习，对己对人均无益。还有一种用数学算法来衡量事物的做法，把正面的现象拉上几条，把反面的现象也拉上几条，以条数多的一方为正确，其实也是错误的。
    教条主义的学习，容易被人认识。经验主义的学习，因为经常穿上件类似实际的外衣，容易被人误认为很实际。
    从自己本身说来，学习就是内心的经常的思想斗争，思想斗争是针对着非无产阶级意识的斗争，这主要是要树立正确的立场观点和思想方法。贪污腐化、不干工作是错误的，这种不正确的思想，容易发现，但对于工作中的许多偏见——尤其是以积极工作面貌出现的同志——是最不容易发现的。不能做到这一步，自党的、真正的进步，就不容易取得。学习中冷静、耐烦的态度，是以科学的客观态度为基础的。谁能够以高度的对党对阶级的责任心来对待事物，不顾自己的得失，才能够冷静地对待问题，不因为事物中存在有与自己主观相违背的事而把它避开不管。虚心学习，就是对党对人民积极负责。只有懂得这一点，才能甘心在人民面前当小学生，才肯听取进步的意见，同时也听取落后的或与自己主观愿望相左的意见，才不自以为是，自作聪明；他才真正懂得不虚心、偏见，不但是害自己，更重要的是损害党的事业；他才懂得“江海不择细流，故能成其深；泰山不让土壤，故能成其高”这句话的精神；他才不把学习局限于反对不正确的现象，而追求反对不正确的观点立场方法。
    有许多人把讨论当为“重述一遍”，或者是围住一个题目引伸一番，或者是咬文嚼字。有许多比较“高明”的人，不愿听取群众的杂乱无章的议论，以为不如腾出空来自己多想一些，多读些有益的书籍。这些看法，都是不正确的。正确的看法，应把讨论看做群众对问题的分析，参加讨论是参加分析，同时又是被群众分析；每个人应准备在讨论过程中接受群众的教育。但这些群众性的分析有的粗，有的细，有的正确些，有的不正确些，互相参证，比较分析，才能得出一个比较完整的认识。真正的讨论并不限于讨论会上，主要的是有意识的经常的把自己的意见，和群众研究，不以自己已有的见解为满足；觉着不多和别人交谈，听取更广泛的意见，便不放心。一个善于学习的人，一定是善于和群众讨论的人。
    学习要思想，但思想不是坐在屋子里空想，而是与群众相联系，与各种材料相联系，在群众的帮助上，启发下，批评下，不断地把思想面展开。呆坐在屋子里，守着党的政策条文，不接触群众，不积极依靠群众的思想，是空洞的、主观主义的、无用的思想，是玄学鬼的思想。
