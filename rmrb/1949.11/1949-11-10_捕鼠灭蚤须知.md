　　Notice on Rat and Flea Control
    Beijing Anti-Epidemic Committee
    Rats are the source of plague transmission, and fleas are the vector of plague transmission. Therefore, rat and flea control is a major task of epidemic prevention. We should adhere to the policy of "catching domestic rats first, then wild rats" and the principle of "every household catches rats, everyone prevents epidemics," so that rat and flea control becomes a mass movement to prevent plague and lay a foundation for the health care of all the people in the city.
　　A　Rat Prevention, Rat Catching, and Rat Extermination
    Rats are suspicious, curious, and very sensitive animals, and they like to steal food. We should target their characteristics to implement capture, extermination, and prevention:
    1. Smoke Method: Use old cotton, chili peppers, or sheep manure to burn smoke and fan it into the rat hole. After some time, the rats will be smoked out.
    2. Rat Traps: There are many types of such rat traps. This committee is collecting experiments and will introduce the best ones later, so they are not listed here.
    3. Rat Traps: Make rat traps out of iron wire and wooden boards, using dry food as bait (there are many large gray rats indoors, and small traps cannot catch them, so large traps must be used). Place them close to the wall, a little farther from the hole entrance, not tightly blocking the hole entrance, and place them stably. Rat traps that have caught rats should be burned with fire before being used again.
    4. Bucket Method: When there are rats on the ceiling, first understand the path they usually take, then dig a hole on that path, cover it with thin paper, and set up a hanging bucket below (containing an appropriate amount of water). When the rat walks to this hole, it will break the thin paper and fall into the bucket.
    5. Bottle Trap Method: Use dark beer bottles (white ones must be painted black, otherwise they will shine, and mice will not dare to enter), put a little sesame oil or fragrant food in them, and place them flat against the wall. This can lure mice because the bottle has shoulders, and once the mouse enters from the bottle mouth, it cannot get out.
    6. Flip Trap Method: Use buckets, jars, cans, etc. to fill with water (about three inches deep). Place a wooden board or water scoop on the water surface. Make a lid made of wood, iron, or thick paper on the upper opening of the container: the diameter is slightly smaller than the original opening diameter, and a parallel round axis is set in the center. Bury this bucket under the ground at the corner of the wall, with the upper opening flush with the ground. Place a small amount of fixed food on the lid to lure the rat to go on top for food. When the rat forages, it will fall into the bucket. The sound of the rats chasing the scoop in the bucket can lure other rats to fall into the trap.
    7. Ground Arrow Method: Make a ground arrow and place it at the rat hole entrance. Once the rat comes out, it can be shot.
    8. Bowl Trap Method: Use a large bowl and a small wine glass. Place the wine glass over the bait, and place the large bowl on the wine glass (with the bottom of the cup facing up). When the rat feeds, it will be covered by the large bowl.
    9. Flip Haystack Method: Suitable in the suburbs, best implemented in the afternoon. Large and small rats are easy to catch, because large rats go out to forage in the morning and cannot be caught.
    10. Poison Bait Method: The ingredients of the poison bait are one part barium carbonate, two parts white flour, and a small amount of oil and sugar. Make small balls the size of a thumb (or a one-inch diameter cookie). Wait for the surface to dry slightly before use. Use one to two balls per rat hole. Wash hands before spreading to avoid sweat odor, and wash hands after spreading to avoid poisoning: (1) Tell family members that it is poison (especially children); (2) Wrap the poison bait in paper to arouse the rat's curiosity and make it bite the paper and eat the poison bait; (3) You can also put a few grains of food next to it (but not too much): after the rat eats the grain, it will eat the poison bait; (4) If the poison bait dries and hardens, it can be crushed and put in food for reuse; (5) Or use the same shape of non-toxic dough balls on the first two days, and on the third day, replace with poisonous dough balls and water bowls to prepare for the rat to drink water after eating the poison bait to promote the toxic effect. This method is suitable for common use in a region and is easy to produce results.
    11. Blocking Rat Holes: Blocking rat holes is generally implemented after a plague epidemic. It involves using picric chloride, arsenic trioxide, and folk methods to spread medicine and block rat holes. After blocking the holes, frequent inspections are required, and they must be blocked again if they are opened. This should be done until there is no opening. There are four folk methods:
    (1) Use six or seven sorghum stalks, cut into half a foot to one foot long, insert them into the rat hole, and then smear them with mud; (2) Mix donkey hair or cow hair with mud and block it into the hole. When the rat bites again, the hair enters its mouth and it cannot gnaw anymore; (3) First sprinkle the hole with lime or broken glass, then block it with stones, and smear mud on top; (4) First sprinkle lime in the hole, and then mix cow dung into a mud-like state and block the hole.
    12. Rat-Proof Ditch: The exchange of domestic and wild rats is the basic cause of plague epidemics, and wild rats have a high bacterial retention rate, so it is necessary to dig a ditch on the edge of the village. The ditch should be four feet wide and five feet deep. A ditch inspection team should be formed at night, and after two hours, hold a lamp and start from one location in opposite directions. Catch and beat rats on sight.
    13. Raising Cabinet Height Method: Raising or moving cabinets away from the wall can avoid the concealment of rat holes and the convenience of rat food transportation.
    14. Cutting Off Rat Food Method: Warehouse food and kitchen leftovers should be thoroughly and tightly stored to prevent rats from stealing food, so that they gradually starve to death.
    15. Preventing Rats in Houses Method: Install iron or wooden rat guards more than one foot wide on the corners of walls, pillars, and under the ceiling to prevent rats from climbing up and down.
    16. Preventing Rats in Ditches Method: Install iron grates with small holes (within half an inch) at the ditch opening to prevent rats from crawling in and out.
　　B　Flea Control and Flea Prevention
    Fleas are the vector of plague, so they must be eliminated. However, fleas are very small and not easy to catch, so houses should be cleaned regularly to maintain cleanliness. Sprinkle lime or insecticides on the corners of walls and wall bases regularly to keep them dry.
    1. Spraying a 5% petroleum emulsion in the house and on the corners of the ground is the most effective flea prevention method. According to Northeast experience, this petroleum emulsion is made of equal parts of petroleum and Lysol. When using, it can be diluted into a 25-fold dilution for thorough disinfection. In addition, kerosene plus 5% soap solution, 5% to 10% Lysol or DDT and other agents are also effective.
    2. Keep the house dry, such as sprinkling lime powder and hot ash on the corners of the walls and wall bases, which can also kill fleas.
    3. Apply a layer of fine sand to the inside of the house, including the kang walls, window sills, and kang surfaces. Be sure to seal the cracks so that the fleas are blocked in the wall cracks and cannot come out.
    4. Clothes and bedding should be washed frequently and exposed to the sun for more than one hour, or disinfected with dry heat.
    5. Pay attention to human skin and avoid exposing it as much as possible. If there is exposed skin, you can apply a layer of oil to avoid flea bites. In the past, in the Northeast, villagers were called upon to wear long socks when going to the fields for autumn harvest, which were called flea-proof socks, and were very effective.
    6. Thoroughly clean, dry, or disinfect the inside, on, and around the kang in the house.
    7. When getting up or going to bed, if you find fleas on your body, you can shake them into a basin of water. After the fleas fall into the water, pour them into the kang and bury them.
    8. In areas where plague has occurred, resolutely kill cats and stray dogs, and enclose cattle, sheep, pigs, horses, chickens, etc., because cats eat rats, and stray dogs like feces and approach dirty places, making it easiest to carry germs around and spread them everywhere.
    9. The environment where chickens, cats, dogs, and other animals are kept should be cleaned, disinfected, and maintained at any time. To drive away and prevent fleas for them, use a mixture of sulfur and camphor to rub into their fur.
    10. Fleas are prone to breed in humid places. Grass can be placed there. After some time, the grass can be removed and burned to kill many fleas.

　　捕鼠灭蚤须知
    北京市防疫委员会
    老鼠是鼠疫的传染根源，跳蚤是鼠疫的传染媒介，因此，捕鼠灭蚤是防疫的主要工作。我们应该本着“先捕家鼠，后捕野鼠”的方针和“家家捕鼠，人人防疫”的原则，使捕鼠灭蚤成为一个群众性的运动、预防鼠疫，且为全市人民的保健工作打下一个基础。
　　甲　防鼠捕鼠和灭鼠
    鼠是一种多疑好奇而且非常灵敏的动物，喜偷取食物，我们应针对它的特征，来施以捕灭和预防：
    １、烟熏法：用旧棉花、辣椒或羊粪烧烟向鼠洞里扇，过些时间，鼠就被烟给熏出来了。
    ２、捕鼠笼：此类捕鼠器种类很多，本会正在征集实验，再行择优介绍，现不列举。
    ３、捕鼠夹：用铁丝木板做成捕鼠夹子，以干粮等为食饵（住室内大灰鼠较多，小夹子打不住，所以要用大的夹子），要放在靠墙近处，离洞口稍远一些，不可紧堵在洞口，并且要放平稳，捕过鼠的铁夹子，要用火烧烤后再用。
    ４、吊桶法：顶棚上有鼠时，先了解它常走的道路后，可在那条路上挖洞口，再用薄纸糊上，下设吊桶（桶内蓄适量水），鼠走到这个洞口时，踏破薄纸，即沉入吊桶中。
    ５、瓶捕法：利用黑啤酒瓶子（白色者须涂墨，否则发光，小鼠不敢进入），放入少许香油或香味食品，平放在墙根，可诱小鼠，因为瓶子有肩膀，小鼠从瓶口进入，就出不来了。
    ６、翻陷法：利用桶、缸、罐等装水（约三寸深），水面另置木板水瓢一个，在器上口做木质、铁质、或厚纸制成盖子：直径略小于原器口径，中心设一平行圆轴，将此桶埋于墙角地下，上口与地面平，在其盖上置固定食物少许，诱致老鼠上盖觅食时，即翻陷桶内，鼠在桶内争逐水瓢，发生之声音，可再诱致他鼠上陷。
    ７、地箭法：作地箭放在鼠洞口，鼠一出来，即可射住。
    ８、扣鼠法：用大碗、小酒杯各一个，酒杯扣在食饵上，大碗放在酒杯上（杯底向上），当鼠取食时，即被大碗扣着了。
    ９、翻柴草垛法：在郊区合适，最好午后实行，大小鼠均易抓住，因为午前大鼠出外觅食，就抓不住了。
    １０、毒饵法：毒饵成分用炭酸钡一份，白面二份，分加少量油糖，作成拇指头大的小球（或一英寸径大小的食饼），等待表面稍干后即可使用，每一鼠洞用一至二丸，撒放前须洗手，以免有汗臭，撒放后亦须洗手以免中毒：（１）要告诉家人知道是毒药（尤其是儿童）；（２）将毒饵用纸包上，可以引起鼠的好奇心，把纸咬破吃毒饵；（３）旁边亦可以放几粒粮食（但不可多）：鼠吃完粮食后，就能吃毒饵；（４）毒饵如干燥变硬，可以研碎放在食物里再用；（５）或第一二日用同形状无毒之面球，第三日换放含毒之面球及水碗，以备鼠食毒饵后，饮水促毒发生作用，此项作法，适合一个地区内共同作，易生效果。
    １１、堵鼠穴：堵鼠穴工作多在鼠疫流行后普遍实行，就是利用氯化匹克林、亚砒酸及民间土方法撒药堵鼠穴，堵穴后须常时检查，盗开了仍须再堵，至无有盗开的现象时为止，民间土法有四种：
    （１）用秫秸六七根，切为半尺至一尺长，插入鼠穴内，再用泥抹上；（２）以驴毛或牛毛，和泥掺在一起堵入穴内，鼠再咬时毛进入口内，就不能再啃了；（３）先往穴内撒以小灰或碎破璃片，再堵以石头，上面抹泥；（４）洞内先撒小灰，然后把牛粪混成泥状，将洞口堵上。
    １２、防鼠沟：家鼠野鼠交流现象，是引起鼠疫流行的基本原因，而野鼠的保菌率高，所以非在村边挖沟不可，沟宽四尺深五尺，应于夜间组成查沟队，隔两小时后，持灯由一个地点相背出发，遇鼠即行捕打。
    １３、抬高柜距法：抬高或搬开靠墙的箱柜，可以免掉鼠穴的掩蔽，和鼠粮的输送便利。
    １４、断绝鼠粮法：仓库食粮及厨余食物，统应彻底严密收藏，务使鼠类无法盗食，以期逐渐饿毙。
    １５、防止屋有鼠法：在墙角柱上及顶棚下，这些位置装设铁质或木质挡鼠板宽一尺以上，期使鼠类无法上下。
    １６、防止阴沟鼠法：沟口装铁篦孔眼须小（半寸以内），务使鼠类无法钻出钻入。
　　乙　灭蚤和防蚤
    跳蚤是鼠疫的媒介，所以要消灭，但是跳蚤很小，不容易捕捉，所以应该经常打扫房屋，保持清洁，墙角墙根经常洒布石灰，或杀虫剂，保持干燥。
    １、在住屋内和墙角地面，洒布百分之五的石油乳剂，是最有效的防蚤法，此项石油乳剂根据东北经验，是石油来沙儿各一半，用时或作成二十五倍的稀释液，可以实行彻底消毒；此外用煤油加百分之五的肥皂液，用百分之五至十的来沙儿或ＤＤＴ等药剂亦有效。
    ２、在住屋内保持干燥，如洒布石灰粉及热小灰等于墙角墙根等处，同时也可以灭蚤。
    ３、住屋内炕墙窗台炕面，一律用细沙土抹一遍，注意堵裂缝，使跳蚤闭塞在墙缝里出不来。
    ４、衣服被物应动加洗涤，并利用日光曝晒一小时以上，或用干热法去消毒。
    ５、注意人身皮肤，尽量避免露在外面，如有露在外面的皮肤，可涂上一层油脂，能避免蚤咬，过去在东北曾号召老乡秋收下地，必须穿长袜子，其名就叫防蚤袜子，很有效。
    ６、将屋内炕上炕下四周，彻底清扫干燥或实行消毒。
    ７、在起床或就寝时，如发现身上有跳蚤，可向水盆内抖一抖，蚤落水后再倾于炕内掩埋。
    ８、在已经发生鼠疫的地方，要坚决的把猫和野狗打死，圈起牛羊猪马鸡等，因为猫吃鼠，野狗最喜欢的是屎，接近脏的地方，最容易把病菌带来带去，传播到各处。
    ９、鸡猫狗等豢养处所的环境，应随时注意整理保洁、消毒，为给他们驱蚤防蚤，可用硫磺与樟脑之混合物擦入毛间。
    １０、在潮湿地方容易有跳蚤产生，可用草放置该处，过一些时间将草搬出烧毁即可灭很多跳蚤。
