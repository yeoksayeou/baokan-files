Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 4th: Correctly controlling cotton prices and protecting the interests of cotton farmers is a very important issue in the cotton-producing areas of North China at present. This spring, farmers in the cotton-producing areas of North China responded to the call of the People's Government and planted cotton on a total area of over 12 million mu. Except for disaster areas in Hebei and other places, the average cotton harvest in the entire region is over 60%, estimated to yield a total of over 800 million jin of seed cotton. When cotton was first put on the market, the government's cotton purchasing branches were not universally established in time, and the lack of grain in cotton-producing areas, coupled with rising grain prices, caused cotton prices to be relatively low. Speculative merchants took the opportunity to drive down cotton prices, which harmed the interests of cotton farmers. In early October, each jin of ginned cotton in Lixian County, Hebei Province, could only be exchanged for seven jin of millet, and in Cheng'an County, it was even less than six jin of millet. In Pingyuan Province, except for Xinxiang, many areas could only exchange each jin of cotton for six to seven jin of millet. In Wangdu and Mancheng in Hebei, Yicheng in southern Shanxi, and Xinxiang in Pingyuan, whenever public cotton purchasing stations had insufficient funds or too much cotton was on the market, private merchants were found to be taking the opportunity to suppress prices. In Weixian County, Hebei, some merchants exchanged cotton for foreign cloth, soap, and other goods at low prices. After discovering this phenomenon, local people's governments led relevant departments to vigorously solve the problem. The Baoding Textile Company held a cotton purchasing meeting in Dingxian and Baoding on October 10th, entrusting county supply and marketing cooperatives and department stores and grain companies to sell large quantities of materials to stabilize the market, increasing the price of ginned cotton to the equivalent of eight to ten jin of millet per jin, and using installment purchases to ensure that cotton farmers could still obtain the increased prices after the price of cotton rose. In addition, legitimate merchants were organized and given appropriate profits to assist in cotton purchasing. From October 2nd to 19th, the Baoding branches supplied farmers with 130,000 jin of kerosene and more than 3.75 million jin of edible salt, and successively transported 1.62 million jin of grain to cotton-producing areas such as Baoding, Dingxian, Anguo, Boye, Lixian, and Gaoyang. Merchants also transported 70,000 to 80,000 jin of grain from Datong, Zhangjiakou, and Xuanhua, so that currency could be withdrawn, prices stabilized, and the cotton-grain price ratio narrowed. By October 25th, each jin of cotton in more than 20 counties in Baoding and Dingxian could be exchanged for an average of more than nine jin of millet. The Xinxiang Prefectural Commissioner's Office of Pingyuan Province also held a meeting of cooperative managers from various counties and adopted measures such as purchasing and selling grain through cooperatives on their behalf and selling grain on credit to normalize the cotton-grain price ratio in order to protect the interests of cotton farmers. The Yuncheng branch of the Shanxi Provincial Textile Company in the cotton-producing areas of southern Shanxi also raised the price of one jin of cotton to seven to eight jin of wheat, and sold various daily necessities to cotton farmers at prices 2-3% lower than the market price. The Taiyuan Grain Branch of Shanxi also plans to transport 5 million jin of grain to Shijiazhuang to stabilize grain prices in the cotton-producing areas of Hebei. The grain has now begun to be transported and is expected to be completed by the end of the month.

　　华北各省人民政府
  　注意掌握棉价  保护棉农利益
    【新华社北京四日电】正确掌握棉价，保护棉农利益，是目前华北产棉区一个十分重要的问题。华北各产棉区农民今春响应人民政府号召，植棉面积总计达一千二百余万亩，除河北等地灾区外，全区棉花收成平均在六成以上，约计总共可产籽棉八亿余斤。当棉花刚刚上市之际，由于政府购棉分支机构一时未能普遍设立，加以产棉区粮食缺乏，粮价上涨，棉价相对低落，投机商人更乘机压低棉价，致使棉农利益受到损害。十月初，河北蠡县每斤皮棉只能换到七斤小米，成安县竟合不到六斤小米。平原省除新乡外，许多地区每斤棉也仅合六斤到七斤小米。河北望都、满城，山西晋南翼城，平原新乡等地，当公家收棉摊栈款项运转不灵或棉花上市过多时，都发现了私商乘机压价收购的现象。河北威县有些商人则以洋布、肥皂等低价换棉。各地人民政府在发现这种现象后，即领导各有关部门大力解决这个问题。保定花纱布分公司，曾于十月十日召开定县、保定两专区购棉会议，委托各县供销社及百贷、粮食等公司出售大批物资，稳定市场，将皮棉每斤价格提高到折合小米八斤到十斤，并用赊购办法，保证棉农在棉价上涨后，仍能取得上涨价格。另外，还组织正当商人，予以适当利润，使其协助购棉。保定各专业分支公司，从十月二日至十九日，已以十三万斤煤油、三百七十五万多斤食盐供给农民，并先后将粮食一百六十二万斤运入保定、定县、安国、博野、蠡县、高阳等产棉区，商贩亦从大同、张家口、宣化等地，运到粮食七、八万斤，使货币回笼，物价稳定，缩小棉粮比价差额。到十月二十五日为止，保定、定县两专区二十多个县，每斤棉已能平均换小米九斤以上。平原省新乡专署召开的各县合作社经理会议，亦采取通过合作社代购、赊购和抛出食粮等办法使棉粮价格比例趋于正常，以保障棉农利益。山西省南部产棉区的运城花纱布支公司，也将一斤棉花价格，提高至七、八斤小麦，并将各种日用必需品以低于市价百分之二、三的价格售予棉农。山西太原粮食分公司也计划把五百万斤粮食运至石家庄市以平抑河北棉产区粮价，该项粮食现已开始启运，月底可以运完。
