The Chahar Provincial Government Instructs the Yanbei Special Prefecture and Datong Municipal Government to Protect the Datong Mining Area and Cease Small-Scale Mining

[This News Report] In order to implement the established policy of protecting the Datong Coal Mining Area and to stop all destructive small kilns within the mining area in a planned and step-by-step manner, the Provincial Government has instructed the Yanbei Special Prefecture and the Datong Municipal Government on various issues related to the implementation of the work to stop all small kilns in the Datong Mining Area, to be responsible for completing the task within the scope of their powers.

The instruction first emphasized that the Datong Coal Mine is the largest and most important mining area in Asia, and the Central Government has determined to adopt long-term, regular, and comprehensive management. Therefore, all small kilns that endanger the mining area must be stopped. Leading cadres at all levels should ideologically clarify this principle, implement the spirit of the Central and Provincial Government's previous instructions, and resolutely stop all destructive small kilns within the mining area in a planned and step-by-step manner.

The instruction also focused on two important issues in the implementation of the work to stop small kilns: one is the worker issue; the worker issue is an important key to the implementation of the work to stop small kilns. Local governments should work closely with the leaders of the mining area, with a truly responsible spirit, to mobilize the masses of workers to protect national treasures from the perspective of long-term interests, and be responsible for solving the employment problem of workers. However, in dealing with the worker issue, attention should be paid to preventing two deviations: one is a purely administrative order, which only seeks to stop small kilns as soon as possible, but does not take responsibility for solving the employment problem of workers. This is a bureaucratic style of work that is divorced from the masses and must be opposed; the other is excessive accommodation of a small number of backward workers. For example, some workers emphasize "working in small kilns is close to home and convenient to take care of", "going to large mines to work on a clock is unbearable", and resolutely refuse to work in large mines. Although these people should be patiently persuaded, if it is ineffective, they should not be overly accommodated, thus delaying the decision, or even leaving a few small kilns to place these workers, which are not thorough solutions. The second is the fuel supply issue: When implementing the cessation of small kilns, it is necessary to understand the production and sales situation, grasp accurate figures, and not cause fuel difficulties due to the cessation of a large number of small kilns. In order to take care of the fuel needs of the masses, on the one hand, some small kilns should be appropriately reserved in the remote areas of the mining area according to needs; on the other hand, the output of large mines should be rapidly increased on the existing basis to ensure a full supply of fuel.

For the several specific issues in the implementation of the work to stop small kilns, the instructions are explained in detail respectively:

First, the issue of profit-making from the investment of kiln owners: where possible, appropriate consideration can be given, but the main reliance is on repeated and patient persuasion and education to make small kiln owners realize that small interests should be subordinate to large interests, point out the harm of small kilns to large mining areas, and their inevitable end to be stopped. An early stop is better than a late stop, and an early stop can reduce losses. Under appropriate conditions, small kiln owners can be mobilized to raise funds to apply for approval to open machine mines, or appropriately shift to other industrial production.

Second, the issue of public-owned small kilns: it is understood that some public-owned small kilns in the mining area not only fail to become models for complying with and implementing government laws and regulations, but instead forcibly mine, becoming the biggest obstacle in the implementation of policies. This serious state of disorganization and anarchism, and the narrow view of only looking at the partial and not the whole, should be thoroughly corrected. All public-owned small kilns, if they should be stopped, should be stopped immediately and should not continue mining under any pretext.

Third, the issue of closing larger coal kilns and extinguishing fires: for some larger private coal kilns that are mined by indigenous methods, due to the large number of workers and large output, appropriate consideration should be given to the methods and timing of the cessation. It is best for the government to send specialists to conduct on-site inspections and study cessation methods. The problem of fires in some areas should be given high attention, and negligence and carelessness should be opposed. Experienced experts from all parties should be quickly invited to jointly study extinguishing methods, measure the burning area, and take necessary and effective measures, such as closing or isolating the surrounding mined-out areas to prevent further spread.

Fourth, the issue of protecting the mining area: protecting the mining area must rely on the strength of the masses. At present, in addition to the mining area leaders educating workers and enlightening the workers' sense of ownership, actively caring for and protecting their own mines, local governments should vigorously mobilize the masses near the mining area and specifically stipulate methods for protecting the mines by sections and segments. Before the establishment of the mining area government, a mining area management committee can be organized by region to supervise and prevent all destructive and stolen mining activities. The closed small kilns must be strengthened and guarded against, and the destructive things of "you seal it openly, I dig it secretly" must be strictly prohibited. If detected, they should be investigated and dealt with.

The instruction finally pointed out that stopping all small kilns in the Datong Mining Area is a complex and arduous task, and should be carried out with a highly cautious and careful, conscientious and responsible attitude and spirit to overcome all difficulties and successfully complete the task. It also specified that the Special Prefecture and Datong City should immediately transfer capable cadres after receiving the instructions, and go to the mining areas within their respective jurisdictions to carry out this work.

### 察省府指示雁北专署大同市府　保护大同矿区停止小窑开采

　　察省府指示雁北专署大同市府
  　保护大同矿区停止小窑开采
    【本报讯】为贯彻保护大同煤矿区的既定政策，有计划、有步骤地停止矿区内带有破坏性的各小窑，省府顷就有关执行停止大同矿区各小窑工作中的各项问题，指示雁北专署和大同市政府，根据职权范围，负责完成任务。
    指示中首先强调指出：大同煤矿为亚洲最大和最重要的矿区，中央业经确定采取长期的、正规地、全面性的经营。因此，对于一切危害矿区的小窑，均必须停止。各级领导干部，应从思想上明确认识这一原则，贯彻中央及省府历次指示的精神，坚决把矿区内带有危害性的小窑有计划有步骤地全数停止。
    指示又着重提出在执行停止小窑工作中的两个重要问题：其一为工人问题；工人问题是执行停止小窑工作的重要关键。地方政府应和矿区领导上紧密结合，以确实负责的精神，动员工人群众，从远大利益出发，保护国家宝藏，并负责解决工人就业问题。但在处理工人问题时，应注意防止两个偏向：一种是单纯的行政命令，只求尽快地停止小窑，却不负责解决工人就业问题，这是脱离群众的官僚主义作风，必须反对；一种是过分迁就少数落后工人。如工人中有的强调“在小窑工作离家近，照看方便”，“到大矿按钟点上下工受不来”等理由，坚决不肯去大矿工作。对于这些人固然应该耐心说服，如一定无效，亦不可过于迁就，因而拖延不决，甚或另留几个小窑来安插这些工人，都不是彻底解决的办法。其次是燃料供应问题：在执行停止小窑时，必须了解产销情况，掌握精确数字，不因大批小窑的停止而使燃料发生困难。为了照顾群众燃料需要，一方面应根据需要在矿区边远地区酌留一些小窑；一方面在现有基础上迅速把大矿产量提高，保证充分供给燃料。
    对于执行停止小窑工作中，几个具体问题，指示中分别加以详尽说明：
    一、窑主的投资获利问题：在可能情况下，可以适当照顾，但主要的依靠反复耐心地说服教育，使小窑窑主认识到小利益应当服从大利益，指明小窑对大矿区的危害性，及其必然停止的前途，迟停不如早停，早停损失还可以小些。在适当条件下可以动员小窑窑主集资申请批准，开机器矿，或适当转向其他工业生产。
    二、公营小窑问题：据了解，矿区内某些公营小窑，非但不能成为遵守和执行政府法令的模范，反而强采硬采，成为执行政策中的最大障碍，这种严重的无组织无政府状态，和只看局部不看整体的狭隘观点，应当彻底纠正。一切公营小窑，如确当停止的，应立即停止，不得借口任何理由继续开采。
    三、封闭较大煤窑和扑灭火灾问题：对于一些土法开采较大的私人煤窑，由于工人较多，产量也颇大等问题，在停止方式和时间上，应做适当考虑。最好是由政府派专人实地勘查，研究停止办法。部分地区的火灾问题，尤应提起高度注意，反对疏忽麻痹。迅速邀请各方面有经验的专家，共同研究扑灭办法，测量燃烧面积，采取必要有效的措施，或封闭、或将周围采空孤立火区，使不再蔓延。
    四、保护矿区问题：保护矿区必须依靠群众力量。目前除矿区领导上应教育工人，启发工人阶级主人翁底自觉，积极关心爱护自己的矿厂而外，地方政府尤应大力发动矿区附近群众，具体规定分片分段保护矿山办法。在矿区政府未成立前，可按区域组织矿区管理委员会，监督和防止一切破坏窃采行为。已封闭的小窑要加强看管，严禁“你明封我暗掘”的破坏事情发生。如有察觉，即应追究讯办。
    指示最后指出：停止大同矿区各小窑，是一件复杂艰巨的工作，应以高度谨慎细心，认真负责底态度和精神，战胜一切困难，胜利完成任务。并指定：专署和大同市在接到指示后，立即抽调得力干部，分头前往各自管辖以内的矿区进行这一工作。
