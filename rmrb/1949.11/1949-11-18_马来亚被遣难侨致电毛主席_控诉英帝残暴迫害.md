Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 17th: The Huiyang Branch of the Malayan Repatriated Refugees Association sent a telegram to Chairman Mao Zedong, congratulating the establishment of the Central People's Government and accusing British imperialism in Malaya of persecuting Chinese compatriots. The text of the telegram is as follows:

To Chairman Mao of the Central People's Government:

We have learned that the Central People's Government was formally established on October 1st. The news has been met with jubilation throughout the country, and overseas Chinese are dancing with joy. Under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, the people of the whole country are united and will surely accomplish the great task of national construction. We overseas Chinese have suffered from the killings and oppression of imperialism for a hundred years. This time, the British colonial authorities in Malaya promulgated the illegal "Emergency Regulations" and, under the pretext of eliminating communism, massively arrested Chinese. Innocent compatriots have been brutally killed and beaten, their homes burned, and people killed. Tens of thousands of refugees have been deported. This kind of unreasonable atrocity is unprecedented and is the most brutal means of imperialism. We earnestly hope that the Chairman will convey this situation to Minister Zhou to lodge a serious protest with the British Empire and negotiate with the Malayan British colonial authorities on the following issues in order to comfort the overseas Chinese:

　　(1) The Emergency Regulations should be repealed immediately.
　　(2) The Malayan authorities should fully compensate for the killings and property losses of our compatriots during the military and police actions under the Emergency Regulations.
　　(3) Those who were deported during the Emergency Regulations should be allowed to return to Malaya freely.

　　马来亚被遣难侨致电毛主席
  　控诉英帝残暴迫害
    【新华社北京十七日电】马来亚被遣难侨联谊会惠阳分会致电毛泽东主席，祝贺中央人民政府的成立，并控诉马来亚英帝国主义对于中国侨胞的迫害。电文如下：中央人民政府毛主席钧鉴：
    顷悉中央人民政府于十月一日正式成立，消息传来，举国欢腾，海外华侨欢欣若舞，全国人民在贤明毛主席与中国共产党领导之下，团结一致，必能完成国家建设大计。吾等海外华侨，百年以来，受尽帝国主义之杀害与压迫。此次马来亚英殖民当局，颁布非法之“紧急法令”，所谓清除共产主义，大肆逮捕华侨。无辜侨胞，横遭惨杀毒打，家焚人亡，整万难侨被解出境。此种不合理之暴行，史无前例，乃系帝国主义最残暴之手段。伏望主席将此情转达周部长向英帝提出严重抗议，并向马来英殖民当局交涉下列诸问题，以慰侨情，是为至祷：
    （一）应即取消紧急法令。
    （二）紧急法令期内，军警行动，吾侨被杀害与财产之损失，马来当局应全部赔偿。
    （三）紧急法令期内，被驱逐出境者应准予自由返回马来亚。
