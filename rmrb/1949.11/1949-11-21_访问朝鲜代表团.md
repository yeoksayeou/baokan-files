Visiting the Korean Delegation
　　Lai Lu
　　The Korean delegation attending the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference includes more than 20 people, including famous Korean trade union leaders, labor heroes, people's writers, worker guerrillas, and elementary school teachers. The reporter visited them on the morning of the 16th. The first to speak was Choi Kyung-deok, the chief delegate of North Korea. He is 40 years old this year and is a leader in the Korean labor movement. In 1925, he participated in the anti-Japanese struggle. In May 1934, he was arrested and imprisoned by Japanese imperialists, and only regained his freedom when the Soviet Red Army liberated Korea in August 1945.
　　Choi Kyung-deok said: "The Korean labor movement, like those of other countries, developed with the growth of the working class. As early as 1923, regional labor organizations appeared in Korea. But from the beginning, it was noticed and persecuted by Japanese imperialism. By 1927, the phrase 'labor movement' had become a criminal charge. For example, in 1929, there was a strike in Wonsan, and the Japanese rulers sentenced the workers who led the strike to three to five years in prison. An employee union organization once appeared in Heungnam, and as a result, the leaders of this employee organization were sentenced to twelve to fifteen years in prison!" At this point, he pointed to a delegate sitting at the right end of the long table and said: "Our comrade Park Se-young, the chief delegate of South Korea, was also sentenced to seven years in prison at that time!"
　　"By 1927," Choi Kyung-deok continued, "trade unions became absolutely illegal activities, and had to turn to underground struggles. It wasn't until August 1945, when the great Soviet Red Army liberated us, that our labor movement entered a new stage. Within three months of liberation, we formed a central agency for the labor movement - the National Labor Council. However, due to the American imperialist invasion in the area south of the 38th parallel, the working classes in North and South Korea adopted different methods of struggle due to different political situations: The workers in South Korea were fighting to win their own interests and the independence and freedom of their motherland; the workers in North Korea were fighting to consolidate the benefits they had already gained and for production and construction. Therefore, North Korea formed the 'General Federation of Trade Unions of North Korea' at the end of October 1945 to lead the labor movement in North Korea. After December 1945, the General Federation of Trade Unions of North Korea officially adopted the battle slogan of separate operations with the National Labor Council, the central trade union organization in South Korea. At this time, the North Korean People's regime had been established. The General Federation of Trade Unions of North Korea began to fight to consolidate the people's regime and improve the people's economic and cultural level. It led the workers to complete and exceed the two one-year plans, and expanded its own organization. In 1945, the alliance only had 130,000 members and 13 industrial trade unions. Now it has increased to 550,000 members and 14 industrial trade unions."
　　Without pausing, Choi Kyung-deok went on to talk about the "wage system in North Korea".
　　"The basic principle of the wage system in North Korea is to pay wages according to the quantity and quality of production. The forms of wage payment are: (1) Cash remuneration. In addition, there are social insurance premiums, national education expenses, and entertainment expenses, etc., paid by the state at a rate of 5% to 12%. (2) Remuneration in kind. The state allocates daily necessities. In the heavy industry sector, remuneration in kind accounts for 85% of wages, and is several times lower than the market price. For example, the rice received by miners every day is eight times lower than the market price. Now the actual wages of North Korean workers have more than doubled compared to 1946. Unemployment no longer exists. Now what we feel is lacking is no longer work, but labor!"
　　"What is the situation of your promotion of worker cadres?" the reporter asked.
　　Choi Kyung-deok hurriedly flipped through the materials, making a gesture as if he had forgotten something important, and said: "Yes! The trade union is the source of cultivating worker cadres. Among all the workers in North Korea, those who are elected to the Supreme People's Assembly as deputies account for 20.9% of the total number of deputies. Those who work in local governments account for 30.4% of the local committee members in North Korea. They have all been cultivated through arduous training."
　　The topic turned to South Korea. I remember that on March 30, 1947, after the delegation headed by Saillant visited Seoul, a member of the delegation once expressed his views on South Korea, saying: "Apart from Greece, there is no more cruel rule in the world than in South Korea!"
　　Park Se-young, the chief delegate of South Korea, narrated the atrocities of the American imperialists in South Korea with a heavy heart. He said: "After the American imperialists occupied the area south of the 38th parallel, they implemented fascist rule, causing thousands upon thousands of workers and working people to hover on the brink of starvation. Now the number of unemployed people in South Korea has exceeded three million, accounting for one-sixth of the South Korean population. In a coal briquette factory in Seoul, the monthly wages of workers are not even enough to pay for rent. This statistical material is only excerpted from the newspapers of Syngman Rhee's pro-government press."
　　"Who can be more cruel than the American imperialists? The tortures they inflict on workers are unimaginable. As long as you participate in a labor union, you may be subjected to the punishment of being eaten by starving dogs. In the past four years, more than 100,000 workers have been killed by Syngman Rhee, and more than 500,000 have been arrested and imprisoned." Park Se-young paused, and continued with a painful expression: "What is the reason for our workers being convicted? It is because they love the independence and freedom of their motherland."
　　"However, the workers in South Korea have never stopped fighting. On September 24, 1946, in order to resist the American imperialist policy of enslavement, a nationwide general strike broke out. Then, a great storm of the 'October People's Resistance' was set off, with a total of 2 million workers, farmers, students, petty citizens, and intellectuals participating in this resistance. In February 1947, the reactionaries arrested 50 trade union cadres and 500 members of the democratic youth league. The working class in South Korea then held the famous 'March 22' general strike, in which more than 90% of the working people in South Korea participated. You should know that the 'March 22' general strike was held in Seoul, which was ruled by nearly 30,000 Syngman Rhee's secret agents!"
　　"The American imperialist policy of interfering in Korean internal affairs was immediately opposed by the Korean people, especially the Korean working class. They held a 'February 7' strike to oppose interference in Korean internal affairs. In order to resist the divisive policy of the American imperialists of holding separate elections in South Korea, we participated in the general election of North and South Korea held on August 25, 1948. Although under the suppression of reactionary violence in South Korea, the number of voters participating in the election reached 77.2%, which proves the South Korean people's desire for the independence and unification of their motherland. After the 'August 25' general election, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea was officially proclaimed. The great Korean people's leader, General Kim Il-sung, was elected chairman. And the struggle of the South Korean people has also developed into an armed struggle. In this armed struggle, the South Korean working class stands at the forefront. In half of the 1,528 myeon (i.e., districts) in South Korea, there are guerrilla activities. In the territory of 133 counties, there are footprints of guerrillas everywhere."

### 访问朝鲜代表团

专栏：访问亚澳工会会议代表

　　访问朝鲜代表团
　　赖鲁
    参加亚澳工会会议的朝鲜代表团，包括着全朝鲜著名的工会领袖、劳动英雄、人民作家、工人游击队员、小学教师等，一共二十多人。记者于十六日上午去访问他们。首先发言的是朝鲜北部首席代表崔璟德。他今年四十岁，是朝鲜工运的领导者。一九二五年，他就参加抗日斗争，一九三四年五月，被日本帝国主义者逮捕入狱，直到一九四五年八月苏联红军解放朝鲜时，才恢复自由。
    崔璟德说：“朝鲜的工人运动，跟其它的国家一样，是随着工人阶级的壮大而发展的。早在一九二三年，朝鲜便出现了区域的工人组织。但它一开始，就遭到日帝帝国主义的注意和迫害。到一九二七年时，‘职工运动’这句话，已经成了犯罪的条款。例如一九二九年，元山发生了一次罢工，日本统治者把领导罢工的工人，分别判处了三年到五年的徒刑。兴南曾出现过一个职工会的组织，结果，这个职工组织的领导者，竟被判了十二年到十五年的徒刑。”说到这里，他指向坐在长桌右首的一位代表说：“我们这位朝鲜南部首席代表朴世荣同志，当时也被判了七年徒刑！”
    “到了一九二七年”，崔璟德继续说：“职工会便成了绝对非法的活动，因而不得不转入地下斗争。直到一九四五年八月，伟大的苏联红军解放了我们，我们的职工运动才进入到一个新的阶段。在解放后的三个月内，我们组成一个职工运动的中央机构——全国劳动评议会。但由于美帝在北纬三十八度以南国境内进行侵略，朝鲜南北部的工人阶级，就因政治情况的不同，而采取了不同的斗争方式：在南朝鲜的职工们，他们是为了争取自身利益与祖国的独立自由而斗争；在北朝鲜的职工们，他们则是为了巩固自己已经获得的利益与生产建设而斗争。于是，北朝鲜在一九四五年十月末组成了‘北朝鲜职业总同盟’，来领导北朝鲜的工运。到一九四五年十二月后，北朝鲜职业同盟正式与南朝鲜的职工中央机构——全国劳动评议会，采取分别作战的战斗口号。这时，北朝鲜人民政权已经建立。北朝鲜职业总同盟就开始为巩固人民的政权和提高人民的经济文化水平而斗争。它领导职工完成并超过了二个一年计划，并扩大了自己的组织。一九四五年该盟仅有十三万会员、十三个产业工会，现在已经增加到五十五万会员、十四个产业工会。”
    没有停歇，崔璟德接着谈“北朝鲜的工资制度”。
    “北朝鲜的工资制度的基本原则，是按生产的数量和质量支付工资的。工资支付的形式有：（一）现金报酬。另外还有由国家支付的百分之五至十二的社会保险费、国家教育费以及文娱费等。（二）现物报酬。由国家配给日用品，在重工业部门，实物报酬占工资百分之八十五，而且比市价要低好几倍。比如矿山工人每天领到的大米，比市价低了八倍。现在北朝鲜工人的实际工资已超过了一九四六年的二倍多。失业现象已经没有了。现在我们感到缺乏的已经不是工作，而是劳动力！”
    “你们提拔工人干部的情况怎样？”记者问。
    崔璟德赶忙翻出材料，做出了一种好象忘记一件大事的手势说：“对！职工会是培养工人干部的泉源，我们全北朝鲜的工人，被选到最高人民会议去当议员的，占议员总数百分之二○·九。在地方政权中工作的，占全北朝鲜地方委员的百分之三○·四。他们全是经过艰苦的锻炼而被培养出来的。”
    话题转到了南朝鲜身上。记得在一九四七年三月三十日，以赛扬为首的代表团，到汉城参观之后，一位团员曾经发表他对南朝鲜的观感说：“除了希腊以外，在世界上再也找不到较南朝鲜更惨酷的统治了！”
    南朝鲜首席代表朴世荣，带着沉重的心情叙述着美帝在南朝鲜的暴行。他说：“美帝侵占了北纬三十八度以南之后，实行了法西斯的统治，使整千整万的工人和劳动人民，徘徊在饥饿线上。现在南朝鲜失业的人数，已经超过三百万，占南朝鲜人口的六分之一。在汉城的一个炼炭厂中，工人每月的工资连缴房租费也不够。这统计材料还仅是根据李承晚的御用报纸中抄摘下来的。”
    “谁能比美帝更残忍呢？他们对待工人的酷刑是不堪想象的，只要你参加了一个劳动组合，就可能遭到饿犬分食的刑罚。四年来工人被李承晚杀死的，已超过十万人，被捕入狱的在五十万以上。”朴世荣停顿了一下，带着沉痛的表情往下说：“我们工人获罪的理由是什么呢？是因为他热爱着自己祖国的独立和自由。”
    “但是南朝鲜的工人们，是没有停止过斗争的。在一九四六年九月二十四日，为了反抗美帝的奴役政策，暴发了全境的大罢工。接着又掀起了‘十月人民抗争’的大风暴，参加这次抗争的工人、农民、学生、小市民、知识分子，共达二百万人。到了一九四七年二月，反动派逮捕了职工干部五十名和民主青年团员五百名。南朝鲜的工人阶级于是举行了有名的‘三·二二’总罢工，参加这一罢工的，占南朝鲜劳动人民百分之九十以上。诸位要知道，‘三·二二’总罢工，是在有着近三万李承晚特务统治的汉城举行的啊！”
    “美帝干涉朝鲜内政的政策，马上遭到朝鲜人民，首先是朝鲜工人阶级的反对。他们举行了一次反对干涉朝鲜内政的‘二·七’罢工。为了抵制美帝导演的在南朝鲜单独进行选举的分裂政策，我们参加了在一九四八年八月廿五日举行的南北朝鲜总选举，虽然在南朝鲜反动暴力的压制下，参加选举的选民竟达到百分之七七·二，这证明南朝鲜人分要求祖国独立和统一的意志。‘八·二五’总选后，朝鲜人民民主主义共和国正式宣告成立。伟大的朝鲜人民领袖金日成将军，当选了主席。而南朝鲜人民的斗争，也就发展到武装的斗争方式。在这武装斗争当中，南朝鲜工人阶级站在最前列。在南朝鲜一千五百二十八个面（即区）中，已有半数地区有游击队的活动。在一三三个县的辖境，全都有了游击队的足迹。”
