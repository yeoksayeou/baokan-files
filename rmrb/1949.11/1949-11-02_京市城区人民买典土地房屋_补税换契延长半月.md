　　Beijing City Residents Buying and Mortgaging Land and Houses: Tax Supplement and Contract Exchange Extended by Half a Month

　　[Beijing News] Since the Municipal Government promulgated the "Beijing Municipality Provisional Measures for Deed Tax (Draft) and Implementation Rules" in September, all residents in the urban area of ​​Beijing who bought and mortgaged land and houses and established contracts before August 31 of this year after the liberation of Beijing, or whose taxed deeds during the period of Japanese occupation were not exchanged for new deeds by the Kuomintang puppet Finance Bureau, were required to supplement taxes and exchange deeds from September 1 to October 31. The deadline has now passed, but there are still a few who have not completed the procedures. In order to thoroughly complete this task, the Municipal Government has extended the period by fifteen days, from November 1 to November 15, to continue processing. Citizens who hold the aforementioned contracts must report and pay taxes within the time limit. If, due to special circumstances, they fail to complete the procedures within the time limit, they should submit legitimate reasons to the Finance Bureau for detailed declaration. Otherwise, after the deadline, they will be punished according to the circumstances.
