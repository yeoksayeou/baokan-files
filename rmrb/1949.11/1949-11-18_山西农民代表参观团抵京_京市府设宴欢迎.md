    [Beijing News] The Shanxi Farmer Representative Delegation, consisting of one hundred and twenty-four people, arrived in the capital on the 15th. Nie Rongzhen, the Mayor of Beijing Municipality, and Zhang Youyu, the Deputy Mayor, hosted a banquet yesterday (the 17th) at 5:00 PM to welcome them. At the banquet, Mayor Nie delivered a speech, saying: In the more than ten years of war, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we defeated Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries. In this victory, our farmer compatriots made great contributions. Now Beijing is the people's capital, we welcome everyone to come and see their new country's capital. Mayor Nie said: National victory is coming soon, which is something to be happy about. However, we still have a difficult period ahead of us in the great cause of building a new country, which of course can be overcome. We must restore and develop production to heal the wounds of war and improve our lives. How to improve agriculture in the future depends on everyone's efforts. Mayor Nie called on everyone to continue to support the front lines, support the cities, strengthen urban-rural mutual assistance, and develop industrial and agricultural production. Finally, Mayor Nie, on behalf of the Beijing Municipality’s various organs, organizations, and people, welcomed all the farmer representatives and raised a glass in a toast. They talked cordially during the banquet, and everyone enjoyed themselves until 6:00 PM. That evening, the municipal government also held a reception with wonderful performances such as acrobatics.
