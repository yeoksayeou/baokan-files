    [Xinhua News Agency, Southwest Front, 20th] As the People's Liberation Army makes a major advance into the southwestern provinces, Hubei and Hunan provinces have been entirely liberated. After the People's Liberation Army on the Central China Front launched two powerful offensives in the summer and autumn, most areas of Hubei and Hunan provinces were quickly liberated. After the victory of the autumn campaign, the People's Liberation Army in western Hubei liberated Badong County on the south bank of the Yangtze River on November 3rd. Continuing the momentum, they advanced rapidly southward, capturing the cities of Jianshi, Enshi, Xuanen, Laifeng, and Xianfeng in succession from the 5th to the 11th. On the 15th, another unit of the People's Liberation Army liberated Lichuan City, marking the liberation of the entire territory of Hubei.
    A unit of the People's Liberation Army in western Hunan liberated Dayong, Sangzhi, and Yongshun in mid-October, completely destroying the 122nd Army Headquarters, the 345th Division, and the 217th Division of the remnant bandits. On the 23rd, Guwen was liberated. From November 7th to 10th, Yongshui, Huangxian (liberated for the second time), Fenghuang, and Tongdao were liberated successively. At the same time, another unit of the People's Liberation Army liberated cities such as Longshan and Qiancheng. The Kuomintang New Seventh Army and its local personnel, originally located south of the Hunan-Guangxi Railway, also announced an uprising on the 9th in Daoxian, Jianghua, Ningyuan, and Yongming, led by Ou Hua, the former director of the Kuomintang Hunan South Administrative Office, accepting the leadership of the People's Liberation Army. The aforementioned four counties were also liberated. The remnant bandits in the remaining border counties fled in droves. Thus, the entire province of Hunan has also been completely liberated.
