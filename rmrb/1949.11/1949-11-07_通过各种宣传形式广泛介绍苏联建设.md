The All-China Sino-Soviet Friendship Association generally introduces various aspects of Soviet construction and the people's lives to the broad masses of people through exhibitions, films, lectures, seminars, get-togethers, singing groups, publications, and the launching of publicity weeks or publicity months, in order to strengthen the people's understanding of the great Soviet Union. Twenty-four provinces and cities in Northeast China have already held picture exhibitions introducing Soviet construction; Beijing, Zhangjiakou, Tianjin, Jinan, Shanghai, Wuhan, Qingdao and other places have also held similar picture exhibitions. In Beijing alone, the number of visitors to the exhibition reached 105,460. In Lushun and Dalian, mass Sino-Soviet friendship forums, report meetings, and lectures have been held more than 5,000 times, with a cumulative participation of more than 2 million people. The "Introduction to the Soviet Union" published by the Northeast General Branch regularly publishes special articles introducing Soviet science, culture, and technology, and has been published to the twelfth issue. It is now preparing to publish more popular publications and the "Northeast Sino-Soviet Friendship" magazine. Dalian also has two publications, "Sino-Soviet Friendship" and "Friendship Pictorial." The "Sino-Soviet Friendship" published in Harbin sells 8,000 copies per issue. The "Sino-Soviet Friendship" monthly magazine edited by the headquarters of the All-China Sino-Soviet Friendship Association was also launched on the 6th of this month. In addition, some cities have compiled and printed small booklets suitable for workers and peasants to read, promoting Sino-Soviet friendship. In Dalian, "Member Teaching Materials" and "Member Textbooks" have been published. Recently, the Zhangjiakou branch is also preparing to compile and print publicity pamphlets to popularize the Soviet Union; the Northeast General Branch has compiled "Soviet Film Selections" to introduce Soviet films. Qingdao, Wuhan and other places have held Sino-Soviet Friendship Publicity Weeks, and Harbin, Lushun and Dalian, and the Northeast Railway Bureau have held Publicity Months. During this publicity period, various methods such as meetings, films, and plays are used to strengthen the publicity of Sino-Soviet friendship. Individual places have begun to combine Sino-Soviet friendship with mass life and production. For example, the Dalian branch promotes Soviet farming methods and introduces Soviet seeds to the masses; the Zhangjiakou branch is also preparing to set up agricultural experiment farms to introduce Soviet agricultural products. The All-China Sino-Soviet Friendship Association is currently screening fifteen famous Soviet films donated by the Soviet cultural, artistic, and scientific workers delegation, such as "Michurin," "Siberian Symphony," and "The Young Guards," in factories, institutions, and schools in and around Beijing, and will organize film projection teams to take films and pictures of Soviet construction to tour and exhibit in various places; the General Association's Picture and Data Room now has a large number of books donated by the Soviet Union, and is also preparing to open a suitable location for public reading and borrowing. Russian night schools are also enrolling students and will open soon.
