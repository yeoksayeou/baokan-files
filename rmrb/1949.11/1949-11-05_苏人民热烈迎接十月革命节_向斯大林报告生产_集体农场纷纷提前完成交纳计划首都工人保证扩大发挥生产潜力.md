Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 4th: TASS Moscow, November 3rd: The Soviet capital's newspapers are giving extensive coverage to the Soviet working people's great victories on the production front in welcoming the October Revolution anniversary.

The leaders of the Communist Party and Government of the Ukrainian Republic reported to Stalin: Collective farms, state farms, and individual farmers in Ukraine have completed the grain and corn delivery quotas ahead of schedule, exceeding the quotas by 0.3 percent. The amount of corn delivered increased by 36,313,300 poods (approximately 32 * jin* per pood) compared to last year, and 47,810,000 poods compared to the year before the war. Currently, a socialist competition is being carried out in Ukrainian collective farms and state farms to complete the delivery quotas for oil crops, milk, meat, and other agricultural products.

The leaders of the Communist Party and Government of the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic announced in a report to Stalin the early completion of the grape delivery plan to the state. Georgia's original grape delivery quota was 440,000 *sentina* (approximately 200 *jin* each, but only 100 *jin* in Germany, Switzerland, and Denmark), and they guaranteed to exceed the plan by delivering 80,000 *sentina* of grapes.

Collective farms and state farms in the Tula Oblast of the Russian Federal Republic also reported to Stalin that they had completed the grain and potato delivery plans.

Industrial workers in Moscow City and Oblast wrote to Stalin reporting that workers, engineers, technicians, and staff in the capital have reached and exceeded the production level stipulated for 1950 in the Five-Year Plan. The industry of Moscow City and Oblast has exceeded the plan for the first nine months of this year. The letter continued: After a detailed study of production potential, we believe that our enterprises—housing construction, machine tools, machinery, and transportation equipment—have not been utilized to their maximum extent, and there is still great potential to continue to increase production and reduce costs. The letter further stated: By more rationally arranging equipment, we will be able to clear more than 130,000 square meters of area in just our 88 enterprises. This will save the state hundreds of millions of rubles and a large amount of hardware, cement, bricks, tiles, and other materials for new construction enterprises, and improving the way we utilize major resources in our enterprises will enable us to produce more than one billion rubles of additional products. The letter concluded by calling on personnel from other industrial enterprises to examine the internal potential of their enterprises, correct and improve the use of factory space and equipment, so as to greatly increase production and complete the Five-Year Plan more quickly.

　　苏人民热烈迎接十月革命节
  　向斯大林报告生产
    集体农场纷纷提前完成交纳计划首都工人保证扩大发挥生产潜力
    【新华社北京四日电】塔斯社莫斯科三日讯：苏联首都各报都以巨大篇幅，刊登苏联劳动人民以生产战线上的伟大胜利迎接十月革命节的情形。
    乌克兰共和国共产党和政府领袖向斯大林报告：乌克兰的集体农场、国家农场与个体农户已提前完成了谷物与玉米的交纳定额，并超过定额百分之零点三。玉米交纳的数量比去年增加三千六百三十一万三千普特（每普特合三十二市斤多），比战前一年增加四千七百八十一万普特。日前，社会主义竞赛正在乌克兰集体农场与国家农场中开展着，以完成打油作物、牛奶、肉类及其他农产品的交纳定额。
    乔治亚苏维埃社会主义共和国共产党和政府的领袖在致斯大林的报告中宣布先期完成向国家交纳葡萄的计划。乔治亚原定的葡萄交纳定额为四十四万生丁纳（每生丁纳合二百市斤，仅在德国、瑞士、丹麦三国，每生丁纳合一百市斤），他们保证要超过计划交纳八万生丁纳的葡萄。
    俄罗斯联邦共和国图拉州集体农场与国家农场也向斯大林报告，他们已完成了谷物与洋芋交纳计划。
    莫斯科市与州的产业工人致函斯大林报告说：首都的工人、工程师、技师及职员已达到并超过五年计划所规定的一九五○年的生产水平。莫斯科市与州的工业已超过今年九个月的计划。该信继称：在详细研究了生产潜力之后，我们认为，我们的企业——房屋建筑、工作母机、机器及运输设备——还没有利用到最大限度，还有巨大的潜力可以利用来继续增加产量，减低成本。该信又称：依靠更合理地安排设备的方法，我们将能在我们的仅仅八十八家企业中清理出十三万余平方公尺的面积。这将使国家节省数亿卢布和大量五金、水泥、砖瓦及其他建筑新企业的材料，将我们企业中利用主要资源的方法加以改善，即能额外生产出十亿卢布以上的产品。该信最后号召其他工业企业的人员，检查他们企业的内在潜力，改正并改善对工厂空间及设备的利用，以便大大提高产量，更快地完成五年计划。
