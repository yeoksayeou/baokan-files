Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, November 25th: After cities in Northeast China with populations of over 30,000 successively convened People's Representative Conferences in September, governments at all levels have earnestly implemented the resolutions of the representative conferences. In Shenyang, after the People's Representative Conference criticized the work style of certain personnel in the Municipal Government, the staff of the Municipal Government conducted ideological self-examinations, reviewed certain bureaucratic work styles of the past, and resolutely overcame them. Based on the resolutions of the Representative Conference, the Municipal Labor Bureau studied the employment and resettlement of unemployed workers. Currently, it has introduced more than 400 technical workers who were unemployed or had switched to peddling to Anshan, Benxi, and other places to engage in production. In order to implement the resolutions on thrift, launching a movement to create new production records, and opposing corruption and waste, Harbin City has organized an inspection committee to promote this work. The collective labor-management contract for private enterprises, which was discussed by the Representative Conference, has also been gradually established in various industries. According to the opinions of the People's Representative Conference, Changchun City has carried out the work of registering and reorganizing street vendors, developed public health services, and tidied up the city appearance. Jinzhou City, based on the resolutions of the People's Representative Conference, has formulated "Provisional Measures for Handling Labor-Management Disputes in Private Enterprises," which has resolved eight labor-management disputes; organized urban-rural mutual aid inspection groups to inspect the countryside; and established three farmer reception stations in Jinzhou to facilitate urban-rural trade. Government agencies have also strengthened the leadership and education of cadres based on the opinions of the People's Representative Conference and punished individual personnel who made mistakes. Issues such as housing rights and rents, caring for military families, and municipal construction have also been appropriately handled in accordance with the resolutions of the conference. After the People's Representative Conference was convened in Siping City, a waste inspection and rationalization proposal movement has been launched in state-owned factories; a movement against bureaucratic work styles has been universally launched in government agencies and enterprises throughout the city, with criticism and self-criticism conducted from top to bottom, and a democratic work style has been initially established. In addition, work for honorary soldiers has been strengthened, such as organizing honorary soldiers' production and introducing jobs for demobilized soldiers. After the last People's Representative Conference in Dalian City, all municipal government agencies and enterprises universally inspected their work and work styles. After inspecting its work, the Lushun-Dalian Postal and Telecommunications Bureau immediately formulated a winter business study plan to eliminate mail accidents and errors in order to improve work efficiency and mail delivery speed. The Dalian Transportation Company has readjusted the tram lines, reduced bus fares by 10%, and strengthened the education of train staff to better serve passengers. The Municipal Hospital has also reduced surgery and hospitalization fees by 20%. Cooperative societies in various districts have adjusted their business addresses and hours to facilitate citizens' shopping. According to the opinions of the People's Representative Conference in Dalian County, it has mobilized more than 440 technical workers and 280 farmers in the countryside to transfer to industrial production.
