　　Wuhan Publicly Owned Light Industry
  　Production Grows Daily
    [Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 25th] Under the planned and systematic consolidation by the People's Government, Wuhan's publicly owned light industries are showing a new look. The Wufeng Flour Mill, directly led by the Central China Grain Company, has been operating in full day and night shifts since August this year, with a daily output of nearly 3,000 bags. All five hydraulic oil presses of the Central China Oil Company have been put into operation, and are currently producing large quantities of soybean oil, cottonseed oil, and sesame oil, with a daily output of more than 16,000 catties. The Central China Paper Mill, which resumed work in early September, suffered severe losses before the liberation of Wuhan when most of its light machinery was looted or dismantled by the Chiang Kai-shek and Bai Chongxi bandit gangs. Through the efforts of the People's Government and all employees to reorganize, it can now produce more than 40 reams of Yuehu paper, gray newsprint, and Lian Shi paper per day. In the future, when the new pulping machine is installed, the output will be even higher. In addition, the Wuhan Dyeing and Weaving Factory, Hanyang Packing Factory, and Hankou and Wufeng Rice Mills are also increasing production and expanding sales under the stimulation of various factors, such as the communication between urban and rural areas in Central China, the increasing smoothness of transportation, and the active development of export trade.

　　武汉公营轻工业
  　生产日益发展
    【新华社汉口二十五日电】武汉地区公营的轻工业，在人民政府有计划、有步骤的整顿之下，都显出了一种新的气象。华中粮食公司直接领导的五丰面粉厂，今年八月以来就日夜班全部开工，每日产量近三千袋。华中油脂公司的五部水力榨油机已经全部开工，正在大量压制豆油、棉油和麻油，日产一万六千多斤。九月上旬复工的华中造纸厂，在武汉解放以前大部分轻型机器都被蒋、白匪帮劫走或拆毁，损失极重，经人民政府和全体职工的努力整顿，现在已可日产月湖纸、灰报纸和连史纸四十多令，将来新式打浆机装好后，产量当能更加提高。此外，如武汉染织厂、汉阳打包厂和汉口、五丰机器米厂等，也在华中地区城乡关系沟通、交通运输日益畅顺、出口贸易活跃种种因素刺激之下，纷纷增加生产，推广销路。
