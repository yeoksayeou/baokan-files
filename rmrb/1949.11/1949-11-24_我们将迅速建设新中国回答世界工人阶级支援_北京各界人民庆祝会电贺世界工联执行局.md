Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 23rd. The full text of the congratulatory telegram from the Beijing People's Celebration Meeting for the Success of the Asian-Australasian Trade Union Conference to the Executive Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions is as follows:
    Comrades of the Executive Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions:
    Workers and people from all walks of life in Beijing, with the most joyful and happy mood, celebrate the Asian-Australasian Trade Union Conference held in Beijing. Under your direct leadership, this conference has successfully completed its various tasks. At this moment, the Beijing People's Representative Conference has also achieved a successful conclusion. These are two major happy events in the political life of our city in the past week. Today, all the people of our city have begun to directly manage their own political power and use their labor to build our people's capital. This is a victory for the Chinese people, a victory inseparable from the sympathy and assistance of the working class of all countries in the world, especially the socialist Soviet Union. The Asian-Australasian Trade Union Conference has many important reports and resolutions, which will have a very important role in the unity and development of the Asian-Australasian workers' movement and in the national liberation movement of the Asian countries. This is a powerful guide and encouragement for all the people of Beijing, especially the working class of the city, to continue to eliminate the Kuomintang counter-revolutionary forces, work hard to develop production, and build a new capital. All the people of Beijing especially extend our assurance to you and the representatives of all countries attending the Asian-Australasian Trade Union Conference: We resolutely support all the resolutions and calls of the conference and strive for their thorough realization, and use our united strength to strive for a more rapid construction of the People's Republic of China, in order to make a greater contribution to world peace and a greater encouragement to the liberation of the oppressed nations of the world, and to answer the great internationalist support and friendship of the world working class for us in the process of revolution and construction.
    Finally, we also hope that the World Federation of Trade Unions and the representatives of all countries will bring to the working classes of all countries and the peoples struggling for national liberation the friendship and respect of all the people of Beijing.
    Long live the World Federation of Trade Unions!
    Long live the victory of the liberation struggle of the Asian-Australasian working class and people!
    Workers of all countries, unite!

    【新华社北京二十三日电】北京市各界人民庆祝亚澳工会会议成功大会给世界工联执行局的贺电全文如下：世界工联执行局诸位同志们：
    我们全北京市的工人及各界人民，以最欢欣愉快的心情，庆祝在我们北京举行的亚澳工会会议，此次会议在你们的直接领导下，胜利地完成了各项任务。恰在这时北京市各界人民代表会议亦胜利成功。这是我们全市人民一周来政治生活中两件大喜事。今天我们全市各界人民，已开始直接管理自己的政权，用自己的劳动建设我们人民的首都。这是中国人民的胜利，这种胜利是与世界各国工人阶级特别是社会主义的苏联的同情与援助分不开的。此次亚澳工会会议上有很多重要的报告和决议，这对于亚澳工人运动的统一与发展，对于亚洲各国人民的民族解放运动，将有极重大的作用。这对于我们北京市的全体人民，尤其是全市工人阶级，在继续肃清国民党反革命势力，努力发展生产，建设新首都上，更是一个有力的指导和鼓舞。我们全北京市的人民，特向你们和出席亚澳工会会议的各国代表们保证：我们坚决拥护大会的一切决议和号召，并为其彻底实现而奋斗，以我们团结的力量，争取更迅速地建设中华人民共和国，以便对世界和平有更大贡献和对世界被压迫民族解放有更大鼓舞，来回答世界工人阶级对我们在革命与建设过程中的伟大的国际主义的支持和友谊。
    最后，我们并希望世界工联与各国代表，将我们全北京人民对于各国工人阶级与被压迫民族的人民解放斗争的友谊和敬意带给他们。
    世界工会联合会万岁！
    亚澳工人阶级和人民的解放斗争胜利万岁！
    全世界无产者联合起来！
