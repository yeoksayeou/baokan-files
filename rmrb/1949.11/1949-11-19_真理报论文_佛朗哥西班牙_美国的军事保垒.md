Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 18th: TASS Moscow dispatch: *Pravda* published an article by Brovski entitled "Franco's Spain - A U.S. Military Bastion." The author emphasized that the strengthening of the peace camp has infuriated the warmongers. The bankrupt "atomists" are increasingly openly relying on fascism and pinning their hopes on the fascist reserves of the Iberian Peninsula - Franco's Spain and Salazar's Portugal.

The author recounts that, in May of this year, at the Third Session of the United Nations General Assembly, the U.S. representative spoke, denying facts without any evidence, insisting that the United States had neither military delegations nor military bases in Spain. However, some facts exposed the hypocrisy and lies of the U.S. representative. For example, in early September, the U.S. fleet, led by the heavy cruiser *Columbus*, carrying U.S. Rear Admiral R. Connolly, commander of the Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean Fleets, arrived at the Spanish port of Ferrol (on the northwest coast of Spain) for a "courtesy visit." At the meeting of U.S. and Spanish generals held in Madrid - in which Connolly also participated - one of the important issues discussed was the construction of bases in Spain and Spanish Africa, and the development of the Spanish Air Force. In September and October, U.S. Rear Admiral Manning, chief of the Bureau of Yards and Docks, Douglas, head of the U.S. Air Force headquarters in Europe, and dozens of other generals and officers who visited Spain also discussed the same issue.

The author writes that the continuous meetings between the U.S. military representatives and the Falangists they employ prove that their common masters on Wall Street are keen to accelerate strategic construction in Spain. A map published by *Mundo Obrero*, the organ of the Spanish Communist Party, reveals the scale and scope of this strategic construction, proving that air stations, airports, and seaports are being rebuilt to suit military purposes. According to this map, fifty-four larger air stations, thirty-seven airports, and eight naval air bases are to be built in Spain and its territories. All these bases are either already completed or under construction under U.S. supervision and are entirely under their control. Just recently, U.S. Major General Kuter, chief of U.S. Naval and Air Transport, Colonel Robertson, commander of the U.S. Air Force in Germany, a special committee led by Hanley, and others inspected the Barajas large air station near Madrid. The U.S. military authorities are also building railroads on the Iberian Peninsula linking naval and air bases and linking the northwest coast of Spain with Lisbon, and the southern ports of Spain with the French border.

The author emphatically states: This is the scale of military construction in Spain. Simultaneously with this construction, the training of Spanish youth as cannon fodder is being intensified. This year, 70,000 people have been trained in the barracks of the so-called "Youth Front." These barracks are prepared to train five times this number in 1950.

The author further points out that the U.S. imperialists are exploiting the Iberian Pact - a secret military alliance concluded between Spain and Portugal in 1942 in the interests of Hitler and Mussolini. At the behest of the U.S. ruling clique, the term of this alliance has now been extended. With the help of Hitler's creation - the Iberian Pact - Franco's Spain is being dragged into the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty. Undoubtedly, the main purpose of Franco's recent visit to Lisbon was to adapt the Iberian Pact to the new situation and to resolve some technical details of the pact's accession to the North Atlantic Treaty system. The U.S. and British imperialists, as protectors and allies of the Franco group, are increasingly hated by the Spanish people. The Spanish people have not forgotten the policy of non-intervention by Western countries that allowed Franco to seize power. All progressive humanity is vigilantly watching their sinister conspiracies in the Iberian Peninsula.

The author concludes: Hundreds of millions of people around the world fully sympathize with the Spanish people who are taking up arms to fight for liberation from fascist dictatorship and against the new interventionists - the U.S. imperialists.

　　真理报论文
  　佛朗哥西班牙
  　美国的军事保垒
    【新华社北京十八日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报刊载布罗夫斯基题为“佛朗哥西班牙——美国的军事保垒”的论文。作者着重指出：和平阵营的加强激怒了战争贩子。破了产的“原子主义者”越来越公开地依靠法西斯主义，并把他们的希望寄托于伊比利亚的法西斯后备——佛朗哥西班牙和萨拉查葡萄牙。
    作者追述称，今年五月，联合国第三届大会上美国代表发言，毫无证据地否认事实，硬说美国在西班牙既无军事代表团，也无军事基地，但是，有些事实却暴露了美国代表的虚伪与撒谎，举例说，九月初，以载有美国东大西洋和地中海舰队司令Ｒ·康诺利海军上将的重巡洋舰哥伦布号为首的美国舰队，到达了西班牙的斐罗尔港口（西班牙西北海岸），作“礼节访问”。在马德里所举行的美西将军们的会议上——康诺利也参加了该会议——所讨论的重要问题之一，便是在西班牙和西属非洲修建基地及建设西班牙空军的问题。九、十月间，美国船坞和码头局局长曼宁海军少将、美驻欧空军总部首脑道格拉斯及其他数十个访问西班牙的将军和军官，也讨论了同一问题。
    作者写道，美国军事代表与他们所雇用的长枪党间继续不断的会议，证明他们的华尔街的共同主子，正热中于加速在西班牙的战略建设。西班牙共产党机关报工人世界所刊载的地图，披露了这种战略建设的规模和范围，证明航空站、飞机场以及海港都被重建以适于军事目的。根据这个地图，要在西班牙及其属地建筑五十四个较大的航空站、三十七个飞机场和八个海军飞机基地。所有这些基地，在美国人监督下，或已修建完成或正在修建中，并完全受他们控制。仅不久以前，美国海空运输首脑库特少将、德境美空军司令罗伯逊上校、汉莱所率领的特别委员会以及其他人等还视察了马德里附近的巴拉加斯大航空站。美国军事当局也正在伊比利亚半岛建筑联结海空军基地和联结西班牙西北部海岸线与里斯本及西班牙南部港口与法国边界的铁路。
    作者力称：这就是西班牙军事建设的规模。与这种建设同时进行的，是加紧训练西班牙青年充当炮灰。今年已有七万人在所谓“青年阵线”的兵营中受过训练。这些兵营已准备在一九五○年训练五倍于这一数目的人。
    作者进一步指出，美帝国主义分子正在利用伊比利亚公约——一九四二年西班牙与葡萄牙间按照希特勒与墨索里尼的利益所缔结的秘密军事联盟。奉美国统治集团的意志，这一联盟的期限现已予延长。借希特勒的创作——伊比利亚公约——之助，佛朗哥西班牙正被牵进侵略性的北大西洋公约。无疑的，佛朗哥最近访问里斯本的主要目的，是使伊比利亚公约适应于新的情况，并解决该公约加入北大西洋公约体系的一些技术细节。在身为佛朗哥集团之保护人与盟友的美英帝国主义者，正越来越为西班牙人民所憎恨。西班牙人民还没有忘记使佛朗哥得以取到政权的西方国家的不干涉政策。全体进步人类正警惕地注视着他们在伊比利亚半岛的罪恶阴谋。
    作者结语称：全世界千百万的人民，充分同情手执武器争取自法西斯独裁统治下解放及反对新的干涉主义者——美帝国主义分子——的西班牙人民。
