　　Central People's Government Ministry of Public Security
  　Convenes National Public Security Conference
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 9th] The Ministry of Public Security of the Central People's Government convened the first National Public Security Work Conference in Beijing from October 15th to November 1st, to unify the national public security work's guiding principles and organizational structure. Attendees included Wang Jinxiang, Minister of Public Security of the Northeast People's Government; Bu Shengguang, Minister of Public Security of the Central Plains Provisional People's Government; Tan Zhengwen, Director of the Beijing Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau; Xu Jianguo, Director of the Tianjin Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau; Li Shiying, Director of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau; Zhou Xing, Director of the Nanjing Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau; Chen Yangshan, Director of the Xi'an Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau; Wang Zaitian, Minister of Public Security of the Inner Mongolia People's Government; Ye Yungao, Director of the Security Department of the North China Military Region; Feng Ji, Deputy Director of the Public Security Bureau of the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government; Zhang Minghe, Captain of the Beijing Disciplinary Corps, and over twenty responsible cadres from various bureaus of the Ministry of Public Security of the Central People's Government. The conference was presided over by Luo Ruiqing, Minister of the Ministry of Public Security of the Central People's Government. Chairman Mao Zedong, Vice Chairman Zhu De, Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council, and Vice Premier Dong Biwu of the Central People's Government all personally provided valuable instructions to the attendees during the conference. Minister Luo Ruiqing pointed out in his opening speech that this conference was the first large gathering of national public security work and was of great significance. As Chairman Mao Zedong instructed in "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship," the opening speech of the preparatory meeting of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and the opening speech of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, imperialism and domestic reactionaries are by no means reconciled to their defeat and will continue to engage in sabotage and disturbance in various ways, plotting a restoration. Therefore, the responsibility of public security work will become increasingly important in the future. In order to implement the tasks stipulated in the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, public security workers must work hard to build up public security work nationwide.
    At the meeting, public security workers from various regions reported on the local public security work situation. The results of the reports indicated that since the Liaoshen, Pingjin, and Huaihai campaigns, national public security work has achieved brilliant results. According to incomplete statistics, in the past ten months, a total of eleven stations, six provincial/regional offices, and one hundred and sixty groups/teams of Kuomintang bandit secret agent organizations have been cracked down upon in various regions. Four thousand and forty-six secret agents have been arrested, including one thousand one hundred and forty-seven important secret agents above the level of group leader, six hundred and sixty-six hidden radio stations have been seized, and countless other weapons, documents, and files have been seized, dealing a devastating blow to the Kuomintang bandit gang's lurking secret agents. At the same time, the people's public security workers have initially learned urban management, which has rapidly reduced traffic and theft incidents, protected the social order of the cities, enabled the people to live and work in peace and contentment, and carry out production and construction, and enabled the brave and advancing People's Liberation Army to have no worries about the rear. These achievements are the result of the active efforts and conscientious responsibility of public security workers in various regions. The reports also stated that although the Kuomintang bandit gang's open armed forces have been defeated by the people, they are using every possible means to carry out conspiracies and sabotage in an attempt to restore their rule. According to the known situation, Kuomintang bandit secret agents are carrying out the following criminal activities: (1) sabotaging the people's economic construction; (2) carrying out so-called "action work," implementing assassination activities; (3) organizing bandits and using feudal secret societies and Taoist sects to carry out so-called "guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines." This situation presents the national people with the serious task of combating secret agents and suppressing bandits. This is a long-term and sharp combat task that must be carried out under the leadership of the Central People's Government by strengthening public security work and improving public security organizations to meet the needs of the people's interests.
    At the meeting, after careful discussion on the tasks, guiding principles, and several issues that need to be and can be resolved currently in national public security work, unanimous opinions were reached, and plans are now being made separately to be submitted to the Central People's Government for approval and promulgation.

　　中央人民政府公安部
  　召开全国公安会议
    【新华社北京九日电】中央人民政府公安部为了统一全国公安工作的方针和组织机构，于十月十五日至本月一日在北京召开了第一次全国公安工作会议。出席会议的有东北人民政府公安部长汪金祥、中原临时人民政府公安部长卜盛光、北京市人民政府公安局长谭政文、天津市人民政府公安局长许建国、上海市人民政府公安局长李士英、南京市人民政府公安局长周兴、西安市人民政府公安局长陈养山、内蒙古人民政府公安部长王再天、华北军区保卫部长叶运高、中央人民政府铁道部公安局副局长冯纪、北京市纠察总队长张明河及中央人民政府公安部各局负责干部等二十余人。会议由中央人民政府公安部罗瑞卿部长主持。中央人民政府毛泽东主席、朱德副主席、政务院周恩来总理、董必武副总理在开会期间都曾亲予到会者许多宝贵的指示。罗瑞卿部长在开幕词中指出，这次会议是全国公安工作的第一次大集会，意义很重大。正如毛泽东主席在“论人民民主专政”及人民政协筹备会开幕词和人民政协开幕词中所指示的，帝国主义、国内反动派是决不甘心于失败的，他们还会以各种方式从事破坏和捣乱，阴谋复辟，因此今后公安工作的责任愈益重要。为要贯彻实现中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领中所规定的任务，公安工作者必须努力工作，把公安工作在全国范围内建设起来。
    会上各地的公安工作者汇报了当地的公安工作情况。汇报的结果表示：自从辽沈、平津、淮海三大战役以来，全国的公安工作业已获得辉煌成绩。据不完全统计，十个月来各地破获国民党土匪特务组织共达十一个站，六个省、区室，一百六十个组、队，逮捕特务分子四千零四十六名，内有组长以上重要特务一千一百四十七名，破获潜伏电台六百六十六部，其他武器、文件、档案等无数，给予国民党匪帮潜伏的特务以摧毁性的打击。人民的公安工作者同时初步学会了城市管理，使交通、盗窃事件迅速大为减少，保卫了城市的社会秩序，使人民能够安居乐业，进行生产建设，使奋勇前进的人民解放军无后顾之忧。这些成绩都是各地公安工作者积极努力、认真负责的结果。汇报中也说明了现在国民党匪帮的公开武装虽已被人民打败，但他正用尽千方百计来进行阴谋破坏，企图复辟。据已知道的情况，国民党匪帮特务正在进行下列罪恶活动：（一）破坏人民的经济建设事业；（二）进行所谓“行动工作”，实行暗害活动；（三）组织土匪，利用封建会门、道门进行所谓“敌后游击”。这一情况，给全国人民提出了反特肃匪的严重任务。这是一个长期的尖锐的战斗任务，必须在中央人民政府领导下加强公安工作，健全公安组织，以适应人民利益的需要。
    会上关于全国公安工作的任务、方针及当前必需与可能解决的若干问题，均经过慎密讨论后得出一致意见，现正分别制成方案呈请中央人民政府批准颁布施行。
