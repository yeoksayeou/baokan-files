　　The Shenyang Public Security Bureau's Indictment of the Ward Case Submitted to the People's Court

The Shenyang Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau has submitted the following indictment to the Shenyang Municipal People's Court regarding the case of American Ward and others gathering a crowd to violently beat Chinese worker Ji Yuheng, deducting wages, and other related matters:

　　Defendant

　　Ward (A. WARD) Male, age 57, American.

　　Rehberg (R. CREHBERG) Male, age 30, American.

　　Kristan (A. KRISTAN) Male, age 42, German.

　　Oicogna (F. OICOGNA) Male, age 31, Italian.

　　Tatsumi (S. TATSUMI) Male, age 51, Japanese-American.

The above-named defendants, American Ward and others, are being publicly prosecuted for the crime of gathering a crowd to commit assault within Chinese territory, beating worker Ji Yuheng, causing bodily harm, violating human rights, unreasonably dismissing Chinese workers, deducting worker wages, holiday pay, severance pay, and wage retention fees, in violation of the laws of the People's Republic of China, after being thoroughly investigated by this prosecutor. The details of their crimes are listed as follows:

　　Criminal Facts:

　　1. Illegal Dismissal of Worker Ji Yuheng:

　　At approximately 8:00 AM on September 27, 1949, defendant Ward forcibly ordered worker Ji Yuheng to demolish a large steel-reinforced concrete pillar alone. Ji accepted the work and immediately began to demolish it with force. However, due to physical exhaustion, he was unable to complete it alone. Workers on the scene prepared to help, but Ward refused. Ji was forced to continue working alone. Around 3:00 PM, finally, due to the extended period of time, he was exhausted and unable to continue working. He applied to Rehberg, "I truly cannot complete such heavy labor alone," requesting the assistance of other workers. Rehberg immediately informed Ward. Upon hearing this, Ward immediately used the excuse that Ji Yuheng was refusing to work and, without allowing Ji to defend himself, expelled Ji from No. 38 Sanjing Road, forcibly dismissing him. The next morning, Ji Yuheng returned to Ward to explain his reasons, stating that he was not refusing to work, but to no avail. Ji was then unreasonably dismissed.

　　It has been found that Ji Yuheng is a messenger at No. 38 Sanjing Road, an elderly worker over 50 years old. Defendant Ward ordered an elderly worker to perform overly strenuous labor that one person could not complete. After accepting the task, Ji still worked diligently. When he was exhausted and unable to complete the overly strenuous labor, he requested the assistance of other workers, but Ward refused his reasonable request and dismissed him. Ward's unreasonable behavior completely violates the laws of our People's Government protecting workers.

　　2. Deducting Worker Wages, Gathering a Crowd to Violently Beat Worker Ji Yuheng, Causing Bodily Harm, Violating Human Rights

　　After being unreasonably dismissed, Ji went to Ward's residence at 8:00 AM on October 11 to claim the wage retention fees, severance pay, holiday pay, and nine days of normal wages he was entitled to after being dismissed. Ward not only refused to pay but also cursed Ji, "You bastard! Get out!" When Ji attempted to argue, Ward and Oicogna drove Ji out, pushing and kicking him down the stairs from the back staircase. When he reached the doorway downstairs, Tatsumi arrived and also joined in the beating. The three men forcefully pushed Ji to the ground on the steps at the entrance. Around 9:00 AM, Ward ordered Rehberg to call Ji upstairs, telling Ji that he could be paid for nine days of wages and forcing Ji Yuheng to sign. However, he refused to pay any of the wage retention fees, severance pay, or holiday pay that were due. Because the amount was insufficient, Ji refused to accept it. Rehberg then violently pushed Ji out of the room, causing him to fall next to the outdoor radiator. When Ji's brother, Ji Yufeng, saw this and came to mediate, he was pushed out of the vestibule by Rehberg, who then locked the door. Rehberg reported to Ward. Ji walked out of the room and, together with Rehberg, kicked and beat Ji again, dragging him downstairs and pushing him to the corner of the second-level stairs in Ward's office. After witnessing this, worker Sun Hengli ran to inform Chinese worker Ji Yufeng, who went downstairs to mediate but was brutally beaten by Rehberg and defendant Kristan. At the same time, Ward had pressed Ji Yuheng to the ground and violently beat him. Ji was beaten and injured, losing consciousness. According to the complaints of 35 workers from No. 38 Sanjing Road, including Ji Yufeng, Yu Yongbin, and Gong Zhendong, Ward's barbaric acts of violating human rights are not new. As early as March 1947, he had successively beaten rickshaw pullers, carters, and vendors, and unreasonably dismissed and insulted worker Luo Xiluan, who had worked for Ward. All of this proves that Ward's humiliation, beating, and infringement upon the Chinese people is a consistent pattern of behavior.

　　It has been found that after Ji Yuheng was violently beaten by Ward and others, he immediately fainted on the ground, suffering serious injuries. Not only did workers witness this on the spot, but according to the court's on-site examination: the injured Ji Yuheng suffered a concussion, and there was a skin abrasion on the right side of his forehead, 5 millimeters long and 4 millimeters wide, non-surgically treated, unconscious, and incontinent. After forensic examination, it was certified that the injury was caused by violent beating. The above is evidenced by the court's forensic examination certificate and on-site photographs.

　　In addition, Ji Yuheng has worked for Ward for over thirteen years, and the wage retention fees, severance pay, holiday pay, and normal wages that he is entitled to are the wages that Ji Yuheng deserves for selling his labor year-round without rest. Ward has no right to deduct them. The wage retention fee is 6% of the "savings" deducted by Ward from the workers' wages, which is actually unpaid wages. Holiday pay is the holiday pay that should be issued to workers who do not take leave throughout the year. At the same time, it is a common practice for workers to receive holiday pay from Ward. According to the laws of our People's Government regarding severance pay, "when the employer dismisses workers, severance pay equivalent to half a month to three months' wages should be paid based on the length of service of the employees." Based on this, Ward's refusal to pay worker Ji Yuheng the aforementioned four types of wages is also an unreasonable and illegal act. Since Ward resides in China and employs Chinese employees, he must abide by the laws of the Chinese People's Government. Therefore, Ward should not only pay all of Ji Yuheng's four types of wages that were withheld, but also be responsible for compensating Ji Yuheng for all medical, living, and other losses suffered during the injury period.

　　Evidence:

　　The criminal behavior of defendants Ward, Rehberg, Kristan, Oicogna, Tatsumi, etc., is not only supported by the above facts and reasons but also by conclusive evidence. The details are as follows:

　　A certificate of forensic examination by the Shenyang Municipal People's Court after defendant Ward injured Ji Yuheng, when the injured was lying on the corner of the second-level stairs in Ward's office; one on-site photograph; one diagnosis certificate from the Municipal Hospital after the injured was sent to the hospital.

　　Workers Zhang Zhongying, Fang Pinqing, and Yue Shanyi witnessed Ward, Oicogna, and Tatsumi violently pushing and kicking Ji Yuheng down the back stairs and kicking him down next to the outdoor radiator at 8:00 AM on October 11, which can be used as corroborating evidence.

　　Translator Jin Tizhi and employee Sun Hengli witnessed Rehberg forcing Ji Yuheng to sign for an insufficient amount of wages unsuccessfully, and Ward and Rehberg using violence to push and kick Ji Yuheng down the stairs to the first level, which can be used as corroborating evidence.

　　Employees Yu Yongbin and Ji Yufeng witnessed Ward pressing Ji Yuheng down the second-level stairs and violently beating him, which can be used as corroborating evidence.

　　Yu Yongbin and all workers Gong Zhendong, Fang Pinqing, etc., witnessed Rehberg and Kristan beating Ji Yuheng's brother, Ji Yufeng, on the third-level stairs, which can be used as corroborating evidence.

　　Two confessions from Oicogna and a written statement of "Confessions of Ward's Barbaric Behavior" are sufficient to prove that the above-mentioned criminal facts are indeed true.

In summary, the defendants Ward and others' unreasonable dismissal of workers, deduction of wages, and violent beating of workers are criminal offenses that violate the laws of the People's Republic of China and infringe upon human rights. Therefore, this public prosecution is filed, requesting a fair trial in accordance with the law.

　　　　Sincerely,

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Prosecutor He Xia, Shenyang Municipal People's Court

　　沈市公安局关于瓦尔德案向人民法院提出的起诉书
    【新华社沈阳二十六日电】沈阳市人民政府公安局向沈阳市人民法院提出的关于美侨瓦尔德等聚众毒殴中国工人姬玉衡及克扣工资等款案的起诉书如下：
    被告
    瓦尔德（Ａ，ＷＡＲＤ）男、年五十七岁，美国人。
    雷贝格（Ｒ，ＣＲＥＨＢＥＲＧ）男、年三十岁，美国人。
    克力斯坦（Ａ，ＫＲＩＳＴＡＮ）男、年四十二岁、德国人。
    希克尼（Ｆ，ＯＩＣＯＧＮＡ）男、年三十一岁、意国人。
    巽四郎（Ｓ，ＴＡＴＳＵＭＩ）男、年五十一岁、美籍日人。
    右被告美侨瓦尔德等因在中国领土内聚众行凶，殴打工人姬玉衡，致成伤害人身，侵犯人权，无理解雇中国工人，克扣工人工资及休假金、解雇金、工资扣留金，违犯我中华人民共和国的法令一案，经本检察官检察完毕，故提起公诉。兹将其犯罪事实开列如左：
    犯罪事实：
    一、非法解雇工人姬玉衡：
    一九四九年九月二十七日午前八时许，被告瓦尔德强制工人姬玉衡一人，拆毁一巨大的钢骨水泥柱子。姬接受工作后，即用力拆毁。但因体力不济，一人无法完成，在场工人准备上前帮助，而遭瓦尔德拒绝，姬不得已仍然一人坚持工作。至下午三时许，终因时间太久，精疲力尽，实不能再工作下去时，才向雷贝格申请：“我一人确实不能完成这样重的劳动”，要求工人帮助。雷当即转告瓦尔德。瓦闻后，立即借口姬玉衡拒绝工作，并不准姬声辩理由，即将姬逐出三经路三十八号，实行强迫解雇。次晨，姬玉衡复往瓦处申述理由，说明并非拒绝工作，但无效。姬遂被无理解雇。
    查姬玉衡系三经路三十八号之信差，年逾五十之老工人，被告瓦尔德却命令一个年老工人做此一人所不能做的过重劳动。而姬接受任务后，仍用力工作，迨至精疲力尽已不能完成这一过重的劳动时，始提出要求其他工人帮助，而瓦尔德拒绝工人合理要求，竟将其解雇。瓦尔德这一无理行为，完全违反我人民政府保护工人的法令。
    二、克扣工人工资、聚众毒殴工人姬玉衡，伤害人身侵犯人权
    姬被无理解雇后，于十月十一日晨八时赴瓦尔德处索取被解雇后应得之工资扣留金、解雇金、休假金、和九天的正常工资。瓦尔德不但拒不支付，反谩骂姬：“混蛋！滚出去！”姬拟加声辩，瓦尔德即与希克尼，对姬加以驱逐，将姬由后楼梯推踢下楼。至楼下门口时，巽四郎赶到，亦参加殴打。三人猛力将姬推倒在门口台阶地上。九时左右，瓦尔德又令雷贝格唤姬上楼，告姬可发给九天的工资，并强迫姬玉衡签字，但对应得的工资扣留金、解雇金、休假金，一概不肯支付。姬因款数不足，故拒绝接受，雷贝格即将姬从房中猛力推出，倒于室外暖气包旁。姬之弟姬玉峰见状，前来排解，被雷推出穿堂门外，并将门锁闭。雷即报告瓦尔德。姬从房中走出，乃与雷贝格再次将姬边踢边打，拖往楼下，推至瓦办公室二级楼梯转角处，工人孙恒利目睹后，奔告中国工人姬玉峰，彼从楼下前往排解，反遭雷贝格与被告克力斯坦大加痛殴。与此同时，瓦尔德已将姬玉衡按倒在地，予以毒殴。姬被殴致伤，晕迷不省人事。按瓦尔德此种侵犯人权之野蛮暴行，据三经路三十八号之工人姬玉峰、于永宾，巩振东等三十五人控诉，已非初次。远自一九四七年三月起，曾先后殴打过脚行工人、车夫、摊贩，并无理解雇、殴辱曾在瓦处工作之工人罗锡銮。凡此证明瓦尔德凌辱、打骂、侵害中国人民，是其一贯行为。
    查姬玉衡被瓦尔德聚众毒殴后，当即晕倒在地，身受重伤。不但有工人当场目睹，且据法院临场检验结果：伤者姬玉衡系脑震荡，头部右侧额角有剥皮创伤一处，长五米厘、宽四米厘、非整形，神志不明，小便失禁。当经法医检证此伤系暴力殴打所致。以上有法院法医检验证明书和现场照片等为证。
    另姬玉衡在瓦尔德处工作，已逾十三年之久，其所应得之工资扣留金、解雇金、休假金及正常工资，系姬玉衡终年不休的出卖自己劳动力所应得的工金，瓦尔德无权扣留。按工资扣留金，是瓦尔德从工人工资中扣出百分之六的“储金”，实乃欠发工人的工资。休假金是工人常年不告假应发的假金，同时工人在瓦尔德处领取休假金也是常年的惯例。解雇金根据我人民政府之法令，“资方解雇工人时，根据职工服务期间长短，应发给相当于半个月到三个月工资的解雇金”。据此，瓦尔德拒付工人姬玉衡上述应得之四种工金，亦属无理非法行为。按瓦尔德侨居中国境内，雇佣中国职工，必须遵守中国人民政府法令。因此瓦尔德对扣发姬玉衡的四种工金，不但应全部付清，而且对姬玉衡在受伤期间所遭受的一切医药生活等的损失，亦应负责赔偿。
    证据：
    被告瓦尔德、雷贝格、克力斯坦、希克尼、巽四郎等犯罪行为不仅有上述事实理由，且证据确凿。计开：
    被告瓦尔德殴伤姬玉衡后，伤者躺卧于瓦之办公室二级楼梯转角处时，经沈市人民法院法医检验之证明书一份；现场摄影照片一张；伤者送医院后有市立医院诊断书一份。
    瓦尔德与希克尼、巽四郎十月十一日晨八时于后楼梯暴力将姬玉衡推踢下楼，并踢倒于室外暖气包时，有工人张仲英、房品卿、岳善义在场目睹，可佐证。
    雷贝格强迫姬玉衡签字领取不足数工资未遂，与瓦尔德二人用暴力将姬玉衡推踢下楼至第一级楼梯时，有翻译金倜之与员工孙恒利在场目睹，可佐证。
    瓦尔德将姬玉衡按倒二级楼梯毒殴时，有员工于永宾、姬玉峰在场目睹，可佐证。
    雷贝格、克力斯坦二人殴打姬玉衡之弟姬玉峰于第三级楼梯时，有于永宾及全体工人巩振东、房品卿等在场目睹，可佐证。
    希克尼口供两份及“供述瓦尔德之野暴行为”之自述书面材料一份，足证上开犯罪事实确属实在。
    总核被告瓦尔德等无理解雇工人、克扣工资与聚众殴打工人暴行，实属违犯我中华人民共和国的法令，侵犯人权之刑事犯罪行为。为此故提起公诉，请依法审判。
    　　　　此致
