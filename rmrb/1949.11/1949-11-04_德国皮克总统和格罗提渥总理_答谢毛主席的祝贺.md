Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 3rd. President Pieck and Prime Minister Grotewohl of the German Democratic Republic telegraphed Chairman Mao Zedong on the 2nd to thank him for his congratulatory message on October 16th on the founding of the German Democratic Republic and the election of Pieck as President and Grotewohl as Prime Minister. Pieck and Grotewohl's reply is as follows:

Beijing, Chairman Mao Zedong of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China:

We sincerely thank you for your warm congratulations on the establishment of the German democratic government and the election of Wilhelm Pieck as President and Otto Grotewohl as Prime Minister. The congratulations of the Central People's Government of China give us particularly great joy because it comes from a heroic nation whose sacrificial struggle for independence and democracy will surely win the final victory. The victory of the Chinese People's Democratic Army over the Chinese reactionaries allied with Anglo-American imperialism is a powerful blow to world imperialism. And its yet unmanifested consequences are to support the liberation of the Asian nations from colonial oppression. The German Democratic Republic, which was established thanks to the peace policy of the great Soviet Union, will strive to prevent the world imperialism's attempts to oppress the German people, and will stop the war in Europe with the establishment of a democratic Germany. The friendship between our two nations is based on close and faithful cooperation with the socialist Soviet Union, which shows the increasing strength of the world's peace-loving and progressive forces. We ask you, with the sincerity of our friendship, to convey our great respect and admiration to the great Chinese people and their people's army for their historical achievements.

President of the German Democratic Republic, Wilhelm Pieck
Prime Minister of the Provisional Government of the German Democratic Republic, Otto Grotewohl

    中德两民族的友谊是建立在同苏联保持密切与忠实合作的基础上，这表示着世界和平进步力量的愈益加强。
    【新华社北京三日电】德意志民主共和国总统皮克、总理格罗提渥二日复电毛泽东主席，答谢毛泽东主席十月十六日庆贺德意志民主共和国成立和皮克当选总统、格罗提渥当选总理的贺电。皮克、格罗提渥的复电如下：
    北京中华人民共和国中央人民政府主席毛泽东
    对于您在德国民主政府成立与威廉·皮克当选总统及奥托·格罗提渥当选总理之际的热烈的庆贺，我们谨致诚恳的谢意，中国中央人民政府的祝贺给我们特别巨大的欢欣，因为它是来自一个英勇的民族，他们为了独立与民主的充满牺牲的奋斗必将荣获最后的胜利。中国人民民主军队打败与英美帝国主义联合的中国反动派的胜利对于世界帝国主义是一个有力的打击。而它的尚未显著的后果是支持亚洲各民族从殖民地的压迫中解放出来。由于伟大苏联的和平政策而得以成立的德意志民主共和国，将要努力防止世界帝国主义对于德国人民的压迫企图，并要以民主德国的成立来阻止欧洲的战争。我们两民族的友谊是建立在同社会主义的苏联保持密切与忠实合作的坚固基础上，这表示出世界爱好和平与进步力量的愈益加强。我们请求您，用我们友谊的连系的挚情，转达我们对于伟大的中国人民和他们的人民军队在他们的历史业绩之前表示巨大的敬意和钦佩。
  　德意志民主共和国总统　威廉·皮克
  　德意志民主共和国临时政府总理　奥托·格罗提渥
