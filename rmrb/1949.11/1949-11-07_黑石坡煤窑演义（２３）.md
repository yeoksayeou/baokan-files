　　Twenty-One　Flooding

　　Xi Lu contracted typhoid fever. He and his older brother invited a doctor from Yangquan to rush back. The doctor examined the illness and prescribed medicine. By the fifth day, the patient had improved slightly. At this point, Yu Bao discussed solutions with the two brothers.

　　Yu Bao was still somewhat unwilling to admit defeat. He went down to the mine bottom several more times to investigate, and after consulting with Ju Bao about a plan, he informed the two brothers according to their arrangement: "This time, I really misjudged the situation and looked in the wrong direction. I'll take responsibility for all the mistakes. But the air shaft tunnel we've dug is indeed not far from the east mine! Now, I think we should continue working! Dig another opening from the east mine, and we'll definitely connect to the west mine's air shaft tunnel! I've also identified a good location for digging an opening in the east mine. It's up to you to decide!" The two brothers, seeing that they had wasted labor and lost money, and unable to discuss it with their father at this time, did not agree to Yu Bao's proposal. Unexpectedly, the next day, Ju Bao called them in and said, "Did Yu Bao talk to you? The mine hasn't collapsed. If we dig again from the east mine while the iron is hot, the air shaft can still be opened. This is a major matter for our village and clan of several decades. You brothers should make a decision and dig again! What's wrong? Are you unsure? Do you want me to make the decision for you?" The two brothers quietly discussed it for a moment and then excused themselves, saying they didn't have the capital. Ju Bao said, "How much more will it cost! The big expenses have already been taken care of. Are you still worried about this little bit? Aren't you still earning some money every day from coal production? If not, I'll run to Liugou and borrow some more. What do you think?" The two brothers again excused themselves, saying they needed to discuss it with their father. Ju Bao, however, frowned and said, "Hey! Don't you trust me? Xi Lu should be resting right now. Do you still want to trouble him and consult with him? Is that how you're being filial? Besides, your father's temper is such that if the air shaft isn't opened now, you'll have to wait until after the autumn harvest. Aren't you afraid he'll be angry?" The two brothers had no response and mumbled something before leaving. But a day later, Ju Bao called them in again, handed them nineteen silver dollars, plus an IOU, saying they were still borrowed from Liugou, twenty dollars, with a five percent interest deduction of one dollar, and asked them to put their fingerprints on the IOU. They couldn't complain and had to comply, saying, "We're relying on you to make the decisions!" They then had Yu Bao start work again.

　　This time, Yu Bao prepared for another day, explained the reasons for the situation to the miners, and the operations in the east and west mines resumed as usual. He also transferred the crew that was opening the air shaft to the east mine, to dig a small branch tunnel westward, to connect with the air shaft tunnel in the west mine.

　　But this time, the air shaft still didn't open! After digging for only eight days, a stream of water as thick as a steelyard rod gushed out, and the water came with such force! Like accumulated water rushing down a ditch from the top of a slope after a heavy rain. The miners in the east mine immediately shouted and ran towards the mine entrance. Those who ran slowly didn't even manage to take out their pickaxes and baskets before they were submerged. Two of them were washed out after struggling for a while.

　　The news of the mine flooding quickly spread throughout the village. The miners in the west mine were also scared and stopped working. Yu Bao disappeared again. Xi Lu and his older brother went to Yangquan again, leaving his younger brother anxiously running home crying, but he didn't dare cry loudly, fearing he would disturb his father. But the mine just stopped like that, with no one managing it! After painstakingly working for two winters, losing so much effort, energy, and investment, now it had truly collapsed! For five or six days in a row, the villagers, both men and women, went to the mine entrance to take a look, just like they did when the mine first opened last year. People from neighboring villages also came to visit. They all remained silent or sighed before walking away. Only the mine owner, Xi Lu, was kept in the dark. He was still sick, and he only knew that Yu Bao was confidently opening the air shaft for the second time. He was still asking every day if the air shaft had been opened!

　　Two days later, Yu Bao finally appeared in the village. He also looked like he had been sick, with no energy and a gray face. He quietly went to Ju Bao to seek a solution. This time, as soon as Qian Danao saw him, he twisted his neck and scolded him: "Is your skill actually a skill or not?" Yu Bao didn't dare to face anyone and said quietly, "This time, the direction was correct, but who knew about this water..." Qian Danao said, "Are you acting as a foreman! Have you never seen water? What do you say we should do?" Yu Bao said, "That's what I'm saying! I... I can't do it!" At this time, Ju Bao became impatient and quickly said, "Now, what's the use of saying this? Are we afraid we can't handle it?" Qian Danao said, "Uncle! There is a way! But this time, you made the decision! Xi Lu is also sick, but he's still going to be angry!" Ju Bao frowned, his face turning purplish-black in an instant. He raised his palm and slammed it on the table, saying, "Can't we make a ruthless decision at this point? If the mine can be saved, save it. If it can't be saved, won't we... come!" Ju Bao turned around and shouted, "Bai Quan's family!" Bai Quan's family brought water and cigarettes. He drank while discussing the solution with Qian Danao and Yu Bao.

　　Twenty-Two　Seizure

　　No one knew what solution Ju Bao and the others came up with to save the mine. In any case, the mine remained shut down. The water in the east mine stopped flowing, stopping about seven or eight yards from the mine entrance. But the villagers were still anxious.

　　After some days, rumors started circulating in the village that there were noises in the mine at night, like coal being thrown or the sound of wind blowing through water. Later, there were rumors that there were noises on the mine site and on the slopes. Then, some people even said that there were noises in the village at night! Were these things true or false? Who had actually heard these noises? No one knew. But could anyone say that these things didn't happen? No one dared to say that. However, these unclear events gradually caused chaos in the entire village, and even neighboring villages started talking about it. Soon, people saw the village elders discussing it at the temple twice, and they saw them dressed neatly, slaughtering a sheep, and steaming white flour cakes to worship the Old Lord God. But what was the reason for this? No one knew. After some more days, people saw Qian Danao leading people to collect temporary donations for the Old Lord God from each household. Only then did they find out that Da San had offended the Old Lord God, which was why the mine had flooded and noises had started inside and outside the mine. How was the village going to deal with this? It was said that this matter involved Xi Lu, and since Xi Lu was still sick, the village elders were just taking turns going to the temple to burn incense, offer sacrifices, and wait for Xi Lu to recover before taking further action. This was truly a rare event that no one had ever heard of. Most of the villagers were skeptical, but no one dared to say they didn't believe it. Everyone remained silent, waiting to see what would happen next.

　　黑石坡煤窑演义（２３）
    康濯
　　二十一　水淹
    喜禄得了加气伤寒，他大小从阳泉请了医生赶回，医生瞧了病抓了药，到第五天头上，病人才多少轻了点，这里玉宝就找喜禄他俩小商议办法。
    玉宝还有点不服输，后来又下窑底打看了几回，并跟聚宝请示了办法，就照他们铺排的告这弟兄俩道：“这回可是我走了眼，看错了方向，千错万错我担承。可这刨开的风筒行道离东窑也的确不远了！事到如今，我的意思还是再干下去！再从东窑刨个口子，准通西窑风筒行道！东窑里刨口子的地势也看好了，你们拿主意吧！”这弟兄俩眼见工也费了钱也丢了，这时又不能跟父亲商量，就没答应玉宝。不想第二天聚宝却把他二人叫去说道：“玉宝跟你们说了么？这窑并没有垮，再从东窑里趁热刨一遭，风筒还是能透。这嘛又是咱一村一姓几十年的大事，你弟兄们就作个主再刨一遭吧！怎么，你们拿不准主意，要不我给作个主行么？”弟兄二人悄悄商议了两句，就推脱说没有资本；聚宝道：“那还花多少！大数目早出了手的，还在乎这点子？不是每天出炭也能进些款么？要不，我再跑柳沟借两个，你们看呢？”弟兄俩又推说要跟父亲商议，聚宝却脸一板道：“嗨！你们还信不过我？喜禄这会正该养息，你们还要操劳他跟他商议？你们就是这么孝顺的？再说，你们老子的脾气是，这会风筒不透开，赶风硬了又得等秋后的，你们不怕他生气？”弟兄二人没话说，支吾着走了。但过了一天，聚宝又把他二人叫去，递给十九块白洋，外加一张借据，说还是从柳沟借的，二十块，五分现扣利扣了一块，叫他俩在字据上打手戳；他俩有苦不敢说，只得照办了，说了句：“反正仗凭你老人家作主吧！”就又让玉宝开工。
    这回玉宝又打整了一天，给窑黑们吹了吹根底缘由，东西窑营生又照常动弹；并把透风筒那班人拨到了东窑，另往西刨一条小岔道，透过西窑风筒道里去。
    但这回风筒又没有透开！只刨了八天，就刨出一股大秤杆粗的活水来，而且水来得真凶！象一场淋头大雨后从坡顶顺水沟往下冲的积水一般，东窑的窑黑们立时一阵吆喝，赶紧往窑口跑，跑得慢的连＠头、担筐也没拿出来，就被水淹了，有两个还淌了一阵水才冲出来。
    水淹大窑的风声，很快传遍全村，西窑的窑黑也吓得不干了，玉宝又不露面了，喜禄他大小又去了阳泉，只急得他二小跑回家直啼哭，可又不敢大放声，怕惊动他父亲。但这窑就这么停了，没人经管了！辛辛苦苦拾掇了两个冬天，赔进去多少心血、力气和垫本，现在可真是垮了！一连五六天，村里人们又都象去年大窑刚开成那样，不论男女都去窑口看看，左近邻村也短不了有人来看望，一个个都是不声不响或是叹息一声，就走开去。只有这大窑的窑主喜禄，却还被人瞒着；他病还没好，他只知道玉宝又很有把握地在第二次透风筒，他还在天天打问这风筒透没有透哩！
    过了两天，玉宝才在村里露面。他也象生了一场病，身子没一点精神，满脸灰塌塌地，又悄悄去找聚宝求办法。这回乾大脑一见他，就歪着脖子训他道：“你那把式到底算不算把式？”玉宝不敢见人，低着头小声说：“这回方向并没错，可谁知这股水……”乾大脑道：“你当的是领事呀！你没见过水？你说这怎么办？”玉宝道：“可就是说啊！我……我不行嘛！”这时聚宝不耐烦了，忙道：“事到如今，还说这作啥？咱怕还没法对付？”乾大脑道：“叔！法是有！可这回是你作主的呀！喜禄又病了，可到底恼火嘛！”聚宝脸一板，霎时间脸上紫黑紫黑地，伸出个巴掌往桌上一刀砍去，说道：“到这会还不能下狠心？窑能救就救，不能救不会……来！”聚宝回头叫道：“白泉家！”白泉家送过水和烟丸，他就一边喝，一边跟乾大脑和玉宝商量开了对付的办法。
　　二十二　霸占
    不知聚宝他们商量出了怎么打救这大窑的办法，反正自后这窑就一直停了工；东窑的水倒不流了，在离窑口七八丈的地势停住了，但村里人们还是慌乱不安。
    过了些日子，村里忽然有人暗里传言，说是大窑里头黑夜有响动，象扔炭块，又象是风刮着水响；后来，又有人传言，说是窑场上、坡坡上也有响动；再后来，竟有人说：村里边半夜里也短不了有什么响动了！这些事到底是真是假？这响动到底有谁听见过？不知道；可有谁能说就是没这回事？却谁也不敢说。不过，就是这么不明不白的事，慢慢竟也闹得浑村乱烘烘，而且连左近邻村也嚷说开了。不久，人们见村里社首上庙计议了两回，并见他们个个穿戴干净，宰了羊，蒸了白面花糕，祭拜了一回老君爷。但这是怎么个情由？还是没人知道。又过了些日子，人们见乾大脑领人上各家户敛敬老君爷的临时款，才打问明白，说是因为大三得罪了老君爷，这才水淹了大窑，窑里窑外闹开了响动。村里社里到底怎么对付呢？听说是这事牵连着喜禄，喜禄病还没好，社首们就只轮班上庙烧香摆供祭奠，等喜禄好了再说。这真是祖祖辈辈谁也没听说过的稀罕事，浑村人大多是半信半疑，不过，却也没人敢说不信；大家都不声不响，等着看以后。
