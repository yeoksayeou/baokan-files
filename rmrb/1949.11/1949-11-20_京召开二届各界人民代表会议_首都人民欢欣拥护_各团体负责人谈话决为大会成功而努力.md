　　Beijing Holds Second Session of People's Representatives from All Walks of Life
  　Capital Residents Joyfully Support
    Heads of Various Organizations Talk About Striving for the Success of the Conference
    [Beijing News] Heads of various mass organizations, parties, and ethnic minorities in Beijing have successively given talks on the convening of the second session of the Beijing Municipal People's Representatives Conference, expressing boundless joy and support for this session and firmly resolving to strive for the success of the conference and the implementation of its resolutions.
    Xiao Ming, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, said: The convening of this Beijing Municipal People's Representatives Conference marks a further unity of the people from all walks of life in the city and marks a new stage in the city's various construction endeavors. Therefore, this conference has already met the conditions for exercising the functions of the People's Congress. Our city's workers believe that through this conference, the city's production construction and people's welfare will achieve higher and broader development; our city's workers believe that this conference will achieve satisfactory and appropriate solutions to issues such as worker dismissal and relief, and the establishment of large-scale worker spare-time schools.
    Chai Zemin, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Municipal Peasants' Association, said: At the last People's Representatives Conference, it was resolved to promptly carry out land reform, because this is the most urgent demand of the peasants, so the villages have been carrying out land reform vigorously under the leadership of the government. This year's rain and flood caused a poor harvest, so the peasants demanded that the government lend them wheat seeds to expand wheat fields so that they would have food next year. The government not only lent 200,000 catties of wheat seeds but also lent a large amount of dried manure. At the same time, it tried every means to help the peasants and also adjusted 360,000 catties of wheat seeds. Our government is truly the people's government, and everything starts from the interests of the people. This conference will also elect the mayor and deputy mayors, and the relationship between the government and the people will be even closer in the future.
    Yang Bozhen of the Beijing Municipal Work Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League said: The Beijing Youth League is sending representatives to participate in this significant Beijing Municipal People's Representatives Conference with great excitement. The Beijing Youth League members will be together with the broad masses of people and youth in the city to support their government with practical actions and strive to realize the resolutions of this conference.
    Xiao Song, Vice Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Municipal Democratic Youth Federation, said: This conference will exercise the functions of the People's Congress, which is a concrete manifestation of implementing the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and strengthening the people's democratic dictatorship in Beijing. The representatives attending this conference are very broad, including representatives from all walks of life in Beijing, of which 70 percent are selected by various people's organizations. We firmly believe that all the resolutions of this conference will directly represent the interests of the people of the city.
    Zhang Xiaomei, Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Municipal Democratic Women's Federation, said: The second session of the Beijing Municipal People's Representatives Conference will exercise the functions of the People's Congress, and it is the highest organ of power of the people of Beijing. The number of women representatives has increased. Our women support the convening of this People's Representatives Conference. It will more widely unite the masses of all strata. We must mobilize one million women in Beijing to jointly guarantee the implementation of the resolutions of this conference together with the people of all walks of life in Beijing.
    Gu Qizong, Chairman of the Beijing Municipal Student Union, said: This session of the People's Representatives Conference was approved by the Central People's Government to exercise the functions of the People's Congress, which is the realization of Chairman Mao's instructions. In this session of the People's Representatives Conference, we students have 20 representatives. We will elect the mayor, deputy mayors, and members of the municipal government committee together with representatives from all walks of life. And we will discuss the city's current important administrative matters. This is the glory of all the students in the city, and it is also the responsibility of all the students in the city.
    Xue Chengye, Chairman of the Beijing Municipal Federation of Primary and Secondary School Teachers and Staff, said: We primary and secondary school educators are welcoming this session of the People's Representatives Conference with infinite excitement. We have 18 representatives participating in the conference and will earnestly elect the mayor, deputy mayors, and municipal government members of Beijing together with other representatives. We have become the masters of the country. This is what the Chinese people have fought for with blood under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. We primary and secondary school educators must resolutely complete the tasks entrusted to us and build our people's capital together with the people of the city.
    Liu Yifeng, Han Songshang, Pu Jiexiao, Sun Fuling, and others in charge of the Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce said: At this session of the People's Representatives Conference, our industrial and commercial circles have jointly organized the Federation of Industry and Commerce and formally established organizations to select representatives, which shows the unity of the industrial and commercial circles and lays a good foundation for the development of industry and commerce. This session of the People's Representatives Conference exercises the functions of the People's Congress, which is the precursor to the People's Congress, and elects the mayor, deputy mayors, and municipal government members, enabling people from all walks of life to directly participate in government affairs and jointly exert their strength to enable Beijing's construction to progress faster. At the same time, the preparatory work for this session of the People's Representatives Conference is perfect. The issues to be discussed have been repeatedly consulted in advance, fully demonstrating the spirit of new democracy.
    Dr. Zhu Futang, Chief Representative of the Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Municipal Medical Workers Association, said: I personally have three thoughts on the second session of the People's Representatives Conference: First, we medical workers had eight representatives participating in the last session of the People's Representatives Conference, who were elected by physicians, dentists, nurses, midwives, pharmacists, childcare workers, statisticians, and employees in various technical fields. At this session, the government and the consultation committee decided to add two representatives, which shows that the people's government attaches importance to medical work and social construction. We medical workers should strive forward and engage in health construction work. Second, the most different thing between this session and the last session is that it exercises the functions of the People's Congress and elects the mayor, deputy mayors, and members of the Beijing Municipal People's Government. Our representatives have even greater responsibilities. Third, the representatives of the first session learned a lot of experience from practical work, so they did a lot of work in preparation before this session. Therefore, it can be predicted that this session will achieve greater success.
    Ma Yuhuai, Director of the Beijing Municipal Hui People's Work Committee, a representative of ethnic minorities, said: In the Beijing Municipal Second Session of the People's Representatives from All Walks of Life, which exercises the functions of the People's Congress, the number of representatives of ethnic minorities has increased a lot, which shows that its representativeness is more extensive. Therefore, all the resolutions of this conference, and the mayor, deputy mayors, and all the members of the municipal government that we personally elected, will surely be resolutely implemented and loyally supported by people of all ethnic groups, so that Beijing's various construction undertakings will take a big step forward.

    北京市农会筹委会主任柴泽民说：在上次代表会议上，决议迅速进行土地改革，因为这是农民最迫切的要求，所以各村已在政府领导下轰轰烈烈地进行着土地改革。今年雨涝歉收，因之农民要求政府贷给麦种，扩大麦田，以便明年有吃的，而政府不仅贷给麦种二十万斤，并且贷给大量粪干，同时，多方设法帮助农民，还调剂了麦种三十六万斤。我们的政府真是人民的政府，一切的事情都是从人民的利益出发。这次会议，又选举正副市长，今后政府与人民的关系，会更密切了。
    中国新民主主义青年团北京市工作委员会杨伯箴说：北京市青年团以极大兴奋选派代表参加这次具有重大意义的北京市各界人民代表会议。北京市的青年团员，将和全市广大人民及青年在一起，以实际行动来拥护自己的政府，为实现这次会议的决议而努力。
    北京市民主青年联合会筹委会副主席萧松说：这次会议将行使人民代表大会的职权，这是实行中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领、加强北京市人民民主专政的具体表现。出席这次会议的代表非常广泛，包括了北京市各界的代表，其中百分之七十是由各人民团体选派的，我们坚信这次会议的一切决议，将直接代表全市人民的利益。
    北京市民主妇女联合会筹备会主席张晓梅说：北京市第二届各界人民代表会议要行使人民代表大会职权，它是北京市人民最高权力机关。妇女代表名额增加了，我们妇女拥护这次代表会议的召开，它将更加广泛地团结各阶层群众，我们一定要动员北京市一百万妇女和北京市各界人民共同保证执行这次会议的决议。
    北京市学生联合会主席古奇踪说：这一届各界人民代表会议经中央人民政府批准行使人民代表大会职权，这是实现了毛主席的指示。在这次代表会议中，我们学生有二十名代表，我们将与其他各界代表一起选举市长、副市长、和市政府委员会委员。并讨论全市当前的重要施政事宜。这是全市同学的光荣，也是全市同学的责任。
    北京市中小学教职员联合会主席薛成业说：我们中小学教育工作者，以无限兴奋的心情来迎接这次代表会议。我们有十八名代表参加会议，与其他代表一起认真的选举北京市市长、副市长、市政府委员，我们作了国家的主人，这是中国人民在中国共产党领导下用鲜血争取到的。我们中小学教育工作者要坚决的完成所付与我们的任务，和全市人民一道建设我们人民的首都。
    北京市工商联合会筹备委员会负责人刘一峰、韩诵裳、浦洁修、孙孚凌等说：这次代表会议，我们工商界已经联合组织工商业联合会，正式成立团体，选派了代表，这表现出工商业界的团结，为发展工商业奠立了一个好的基础。这次各界人民代表会议执行人民代表大会的职权，是走向人民代表大会的先声，并且选举市长、副市长及市政府委员，使各界人士直接参加政府作事，共同发挥力量，使北京的建设能够更快的进展。同时，这次代表会议准备工作完善，关于讨论的问题，事前都经过反复协商，充分表现了新民主主义的精神。
    北京市医务工作者协会筹备会首席代表诸福棠大夫说：对于第二届各界人民代表会议，我个人有三点感想：第一，我们医务工作者在上届代表会议时有八位代表参加，是由医师、牙医师、护士、助产士、药剂人员、保育人员、统计人员，以及各种技术方面的员工各部门推选出来的，这一届会议，由政府和协商委员会决定，增加了两位代表，足见人民政府重视医务工作与社会建设。我们做医务工作的人，更应当奋发前进，从事卫生建设工作。第二，本届会议与上届会议最不同的地方，就是代行人民代表大会的职权，选举市长副市长和北京市人民政府委员，我们代表的责任更加重大了。第三，第一届会议的代表从实地工作中学习了不少经验，所以在本届会议之前，在准备工作上做了很多工作，因此可以预祝这次会议将会获得更大的成功。
    少数民族代表北京市回民工作委员会主任马玉槐说：在行使人民代表大会职权的北京市第二届各界人民代表会议中，少数民族代表的名额是增加了很多，这说明其代表性的更加广泛。因此，本届会议的一切决议，和我们亲自选举出来的市长、副市长及全体市政府委员，必会获得各族人民的坚决执行和忠诚的拥护，使北京市的各种建设向前跨进一大步。
