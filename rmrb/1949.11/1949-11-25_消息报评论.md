Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 24th. TASS Moscow dispatch: A correspondent for "Izvestia" in Warsaw comments on the new and significant victories of the Polish working people in building a people's democratic state. The correspondent points out that the three-year plan for the restoration of the national economy was completed on November 1st. Prior to this, twenty-five major Polish industries had already surpassed the three-year plan in terms of output. Agriculture is being victoriously revived, receiving more tractors, farming machinery, tools, and fertilizers than stipulated in the plan. The sown area, the total harvest of grains and other crops, and the increase in the number of cattle and horses have all exceeded the targets set by the three-year plan. Today, Poland's industrial production has almost exceeded the pre-war level by 75 percent, and industrial output per person is 2.5 times higher than before the war. The country's industrialization has made great progress, with the industry producing the means of production increasing output more than other industries. In 1946, the production of means of production accounted for 51 percent of total industrial output, and this year it has risen to 55 percent. The living standards of the working people are improving. The Polish people are engaged in the work of economic revival under extremely difficult conditions. The material losses suffered by Poland due to the fascist invasion amounted to nearly 90 billion pre-war zlotys (Polish currency), equivalent to five times Poland's national income in 1938. Before the war, Poland's average annual capital investment was 2 billion to 2.5 billion zlotys. At this pace, the recovery of Poland's national economy would have taken 40 to 50 years. However, democratic Poland was able to complete it victoriously within three years. This is due to the fundamental democratic reforms of industry and agriculture, the transition of the economy to a planned path, the Soviet Union's selfless and fraternal assistance, and friendly cooperation with people's democratic countries. The early completion of the three-year plan is the Polish working people's response to all the conspiracies of foreign imperialists and their lackeys in Poland.

    【新华社北京二十四日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：消息报驻华沙记者评论波兰劳动人民在建设人民民主国家的新的重大胜利。记者指出，恢复国民经济的三年计划已于十一月一日完成。在这以前，波兰已有二十五种主要工业在产量上超过了三年计划，农业正在胜利地复兴着，并得到了较计划所规定为多的拖拉机、耕作机器、工具及肥料。在播种面积，谷物和其他农作物的总收获量、牛马数目的增加上均已超过三年计划所规定的目标。今天，波兰工业的生产，几乎已超过战前水平百分之七十五，每人的工业产量超过战前二点五倍。国家的工业化已获得巨大进步，制造生产工具的工业在增加产量上比其他工业为大。一九四六年，生产工具的生产占工业总产量的百分之五十一，本年则已上升至百分之五十五。劳动人民的生活水平在提高着。波兰人民是在极困难的条件下从事复兴经济工作的，法西斯侵入使波兰蒙受的物质损失几达九百亿战前兹罗提（波币），相当于一九三八年波兰国民收入的五倍。战前，波兰每年资本投资平均为二十亿至二十五亿兹罗提，若按这样的步调前进，波兰国民经济的恢复需要四十年到五十年。但民主波兰却能在三年之内胜利地完成了，这是由于工业和农业的根本的民主改革，与经济之转入计划化道路，由于苏联的大公无私的兄弟般的援助，以及与人民民主国家的友好合作。先期完成三年计划是波兰劳动人民对外国帝国主义者及其在波兰的走卒的一切阴谋的答复。
