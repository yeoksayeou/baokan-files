　　Preliminary Study of Beijing Consumer Cooperatives
    Zheng Zhong
  　I. Establishment Process and Development Status
    After the liberation of Beijing, in order to stabilize the lives of workers and ensure payment in kind, worker consumer cooperatives were first established in state-owned enterprises and factories. For private enterprises and factories, government offices, and schools, selective pilot cooperatives were established. As for citizen consumer cooperatives, they were initially established by street, but the members did not know each other and lacked a mass base. Later, industry trade unions gradually organized, and from August, the method of establishing cooperatives was improved, focusing on organized labor industries and taking into account geographical areas. The first step was to establish consumer cooperatives for transportation workers (mainly rickshaw pullers) in all districts and streets of the city. As of the end of September, a total of 51 worker consumer cooperatives have been established in state-owned enterprises and factories throughout the city (reaching one cooperative per factory), with 146,547 members; six worker cooperatives in private factories, with 1,545 members; 37 cooperatives in government offices, with 36,974 members; seven cooperatives in schools, with 13,678 members; 51 cooperatives in streets, with 63,528 members; and four supply and marketing cooperatives in suburban areas, with 21,417 members, totaling 156 cooperatives, with 283,689 members, accounting for approximately 15 percent of the city's population. This has reduced the intermediate exploitation of a large part of the working people in purchasing living materials and reduced the impact of price fluctuations.
  　II. Business Operation Issues
    Smaller cooperatives generally only sell grain and do not have cadres detached from production. Larger cooperatives have specialized management personnel, and the goods include grain, non-staple food, cloth, and daily necessities. According to the statistics provided by the Grain Company and the Municipal Supply and Marketing General Cooperative, the main items supplied in the past six months (March to August) were: 25,016,713 jin of grain, 8,499 bolts of municipal cloth, 404 bales of cotton yarn, 619,037 jin of cotton (including seed cotton), 23,846 packs of cigarettes, and 3,012 tons of coal. Based on the percentage of goods purchased from state-owned enterprises in four typical cooperatives, which accounts for 80 percent, and the remaining 20 percent purchased separately, the total supply can also be estimated in general.
    During the process of establishing cooperatives, due to insufficient manpower in the general cooperative, there was less guidance. The accounting organization and business operations of the worker cooperatives were created by themselves, resulting in some presidents being short of funds and goods, and unable to settle accounts in a timely manner; some accounting and business operations lacked a system of checks and balances, with accounting, purchasing, and warehousing each doing their own thing, not understanding the situation of each other, and no one unified control and guidance. Recently, the general cooperative is conducting typical investigations to study the establishment of a relatively unified and sound accounting, business, and reporting system. At the beginning of the establishment of street cooperatives, they were closely led in conjunction with the cadres of the district trade unions, and a unified accounting and reporting system was established, so fewer problems occurred in this regard. However, there were also some deviations, such as a few cooperatives fearing losses, buying millet with their shares and not daring to use it, or depositing it in banks at real value. The general cooperative has corrected this. In the half-year of exploration, the cooperatives have overcome many difficulties and accumulated preliminary experience. The money lost due to the decline in prices in June has been compensated for through the operation of July and August, and 80 percent of the cooperatives have made money and expanded their operating strength.
    The main problems in business are complicated procedures and the inability to meet the needs of members. For example, the Qianmen Cooperative of the Railway Bureau only sells 200 portions of goods during the day, and family members of cooperative members wait in shifts; before the payment of wages, some even have to wait one or two days and run five or six times to buy things, and the least have to wait half a day. Half of the cooperatives cannot allow members to pick and choose at will, which is inconvenient; in addition, the types of goods are incomplete, and they cannot meet the requirements of members. As a result, when the market price is stable, some members feel that the discount is limited, so they go to the market to buy. According to the survey of four typical cooperatives, namely Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, Water Company, Qinghe Woolen Mill, and Telecommunications Bureau, the average sales volume of cooperatives in August only accounted for 33.66 percent of the total wages of members. If cooperatives can flexibly change prices, maintain a certain distance from market prices, and always prepare various grains that meet needs, and prepare coal, cloth, non-staple food, and various daily necessities according to seasonal changes, the purchase volume of members can be greatly increased.
    Some cooperatives have exerted creativity and carried out business in many ways. For example, the Clothing Factory installed its own electric grinder to ensure that members could eat good noodles; the Water Company bought its own coal to make briquettes and added the sale of car parts; the Shijingshan Power Plant handled "real-value savings"; all of which were supported by members. The newspaper cooperative handled bathhouses and haircuts for members; the Telecommunications Bureau cooperative engaged in canteens, book departments, and sewing departments, all of which were supported by members.
    In simplifying the procedures for buying goods, experience has proved that the role of the group must be brought into play. The Telecommunications Bureau Cooperative and the Qianmen District Cooperative of the Railway Bureau both have more than 10,000 members, but they hand the grain over to the groups or branch stations, who then distribute it to everyone. The automobile repair factory divides all members into three days to pick up grain. The group leader gathers the bags, hangs paper notes stating the type and amount of grain needed by each person, and the cooperative loads them one by one. They are taken away after work, saving members from delaying work to wait; five days before each wage payment, the number of grains to be purchased is counted. The grain is distributed three days in advance. After the wages are paid, the group leader collects the payment on behalf of the members and submits it to the cooperative, which is fast and good, and convenient for the members.
    In order to support the development of cooperatives, the Grain Company decided to lower the wholesale price by another 4 percent and allow credit for ten days. Because the price of goods generally rises steadily, the cooperatives have earned "market profits." Part of the surplus of the cooperatives should be used to pay the salaries of cadres and operating expenses, gradually achieving self-reliance and overcoming the abnormal phenomenon of relying on administrative expenses. The main part should expand business operations to further meet the needs of members. It is also very beneficial to members to set up family sewing and washing departments, provide loans to support family production, etc.
  　III. The Price Issue of Cooperatives
    At present, there are generally four types of methods for determining the price of goods in cooperatives: The first is to sell at the purchase price. This method is very clumsy, because members will be dissatisfied when the market price falls, and the cooperative will lose money when the market price rises. The second is to change daily according to the price of the Grain Company. This has some profit-making points of view, and cannot give equal opportunities to members who buy first and later, which will inevitably form a rush to purchase. The third is to set a fixed price for three or five days according to the number of members, so that everyone can buy the same grain within the specified time. After the expiration date, the price is adjusted according to the price of the grain, and the cooperative can also keep the goods. This method is better. The fourth is to provide members with various goods on credit at any time, and deduct the payment at a unified price one day before the payment of wages. This method is the best, first, it is convenient for members and increases the amount of goods purchased by members; second, it reduces cash receipts and expenditures, and the accounting department and the bank can use checks for transfer, which has a great effect on currency withdrawal and stabilizing market prices.
    IV. The Relationship between Cooperatives and Various Parties
    With the administrative aspect: Most cooperatives have received great help from the administration, such as allocating houses and furniture; lending funds or assigning cadres; and more than half of them paying cadres' salaries, and some even supplying office supplies. Because the cooperative has solved the material supply of employees, they will be more at ease in production. Therefore, it is completely correct for the administration to vigorously support the cooperative. However, there are also a few factories that do not provide good support, do not have dealings in accounting, do not give cadres; some cooperatives have not even solved the problem of housing for half a year after their establishment, and they are squeezed together with the kitchen, unable to add goods, which directly affects the development of business and the welfare of members.
    With the trade union aspect: The goals of the cooperative and the welfare department of the trade union are the same. It is necessary to obtain the direct help and leadership of the trade union (the labor insurance committee participates in the cooperative committee) in order to closely connect with the masses and gain the support and belief of the masses; the trade union should also use the organizational system to mobilize members to "run the cooperative together." However, if the Railway Qianmen District regards the cooperative as a component of the trade union, and everything related to connecting with the masses is done through the welfare cadres, and they are only responsible to the trade union, this is also a deviation.
    With the Municipal General Cooperative: The cooperative is a mass economic organization of democratic centralism. In addition to being managed by the "cooperative committee" generated by the members, it should also be under the regular leadership of the Municipal General Cooperative, which cannot be ignored in the slightest. Therefore, it must be closely combined with the General Cooperative to become a complete and unified whole, in order to play the role of reducing intermediate exploitation, ensuring the lives of employees, coordinating with the state-owned economy, and stabilizing market prices. The Water Company and Telecommunications Bureau cooperatives have developed greatly in their business because they often ask for instructions and contact the General Cooperative, which is a powerful proof.
    Relationship with members and group leaders: Members are the service objects of the cooperative, and cooperative cadres are the quartermasters of the members. This relationship must be clarified, and members must be received with humility, kindness, and enthusiasm, and their opinions on the cooperative should be solicited at any time to understand their needs in order to improve business. The group leader is the grassroots cadre of the cooperative and the bridge between the cooperative and the members. This link must be improved, and meetings should be held to help the group leader, increase the prestige of the group leader, and give play to the role of the group in order to consolidate the foundation of the cooperative. The Water Company Cooperative has been relatively successful in this regard.
    V. The Cadre Issue of Cooperatives
    The cadres of the street cooperatives are mostly appointed by the preparatory committees of the district rickshaw unions. They are elected by the members. The salary is based on the average income of ordinary rickshaw workers, ranging from three to five jin of millet per day. Currently, there are 236 cadres in 51 cooperatives in the city. Most of them can exert the spirit of hard work and plain living and wholeheartedly serve the members, and are supported by the members, but there are also individual cadres who despise labor when they become cadres; a few societies have poor accounting ability and cannot be competent. These phenomena have now been gradually corrected.
    The cadres of the worker cooperatives are generally employees of the department, and most of them are paid by administrative expenses. Because most societies have surpluses in the half-year operation, the administration has raised the issue of self-reliance. The cooperative feels that it is a "pressure." In fact, according to the current situation, this may be possible. For example, the Auto Repair Factory Cooperative can still pay two or three people from the 4% discount.
    The cooperative cadres of technical research institutions are unwilling to separate from technology and require the General Cooperative to send cadres; the cooperative employees of public utility institutions have seniority and relatively high salaries, many of which are more than 400 or 500 jin, forming a phenomenon of large differences in the salaries of cooperative cadres in the city. The Railway Bureau Qianmen District and other societies are composed of representatives selected by various departments to form the cooperative, which is re-elected every March. This cannot cultivate the sense of responsibility of cadres; some people are afraid that they will not be able to return to their original department in the future and are afraid of unemployment, which affects the development prospects of the entire work. A more common problem is that they are unfamiliar with the work and are busy with affairs, and cannot carry out business learning. Therefore, individualism has occurred, which affects business development, and the phenomenon of only caring about the interests of their own unit and over-purchasing. This is all due to insufficient political understanding and the inability to grasp the cooperative policy of new democracy. Recently, many cadres have raised learning requirements, and the General Cooperative also intends to use the form of organizing rotational training and holding business research meetings to help improve the policy level and operating ability of cooperative cadres.
    VI. The Issue of Member Education
    The cooperative is a new work. The members of the society do not have enough understanding of the differences between it and the cooperatives of the old society. Many members only plan from personal interests and engage in speculative behavior in the cooperative. When the market price is sluggish, they do not buy the grain they filled out the form to register; when the market price rises, they swarm to the cooperative to settle old accounts, complaining about why the cooperative did not store a large amount of grain, and demanding to buy the previously abandoned grain at once; some members think that buying things at the cooperative is "bowing their heads," and if there is not much difference in the price, they simply go to the market to buy to save trouble; some people borrow new pockets from the cooperative and exchange them for old pockets, or only send them back after they are broken; these are all manifestations of insufficient understanding of the cooperative. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen member education and use all opportunities such as buying goods, chatting, wall newspapers, notices, group meetings, and mass meetings to promote that the cooperative belongs to everyone, call on everyone to cherish the cooperative, and manage the cooperative with the attitude of masters. This is one of the urgent tasks of the current cooperative movement.

　　北京市消费合作社初步研究
    郑重
  　一、建社过程和发展现状
    北京解放后，为了安定职工生活，保障实物工薪，首先在公营企业工厂建立职工消费合作社；对于私营企业工厂、机关、学校则进行有重点的试验建社。至于市民消费社，起初曾按街道建立，但入社社员互不了解，没有群众基础，后各行业工会逐渐组织起来了，八月份起乃改进建社办法，以有组织的劳动行业为主，并照顾到地区。第一步在全市各区街普遍建立搬运工人（主要是三轮工人）消费社。截至九月底，全市计共已建立公营企业工厂职工消费社五十一个（已达到每厂一社），社员一四六、五四七人；私营工厂职工社六个，社员一、五四五人；机关社三十七个，社员三六、九七四人；学校社七个，社员一三、六七八人；街道社五十一个，社员六三、五二八人；还有郊区供销社四个，社员二一、四一七人；共计一五六社，社员二八三、六八九人，约占全市人口的百分之十五。使很大一部分劳动人民，减少了购买生活资料的中间剥削。少受物价波动的影响。
  　二、业务经营问题
    较小的合作社，一般只卖粮食，不设脱离生产干部。较大的合作社，都有专门的经营人员，货品有粮食、副食品、布匹、日用品等。半年来（三月至八月）主要物品供应，据粮食公司及市供销总社供给的数字统计：粮食二五、○一六、七一三斤，市布八、四九九匹，棉纱四○四件，棉花六一九、○三七斤（包括皮棉），纸烟二三、八四六条，煤三、○一二吨。根据四个典型社的货进百分比，购自公营企业者占百分之八十，尚有百分之二十另外购入，则其总的供给量也可作一般的估计。
    建社过程中因总社人力不够，指导较少，职工社之会计组织，业务经营，都由各自创造，产生有些社长款、短货，不能及时结帐的现象；还有的会计和业务没有牵制制度，会计、采购、仓库各干各的，互不了解情况及无人统一掌握指导等偏向。近总社正进行典型调查，研究建立比较统一的健全的会计、业务和报告制度。街道社建立之始，就结合区工会干部抓紧领导，规定了统一的会计和表报制度，所以在这方面发生问题较少。但也有过偏向，如少数社怕赔钱，把股金买成小米不敢动，或到银行折实储蓄。总社已予纠正。各社在半年的摸索中，也都克服了许多困难，积累了初步经验，六月份因物价下落赔的钱，经过七、八两月的经营，都已弥补了亏损，并有百分之八十的合作社赚了钱，扩大了经营力量。
    业务上存在的问题，主要是手续复杂和不能满足社员需要。如铁路局前门社，白天只卖二百份货物，社员家属排班等候；在发工资前有的甚至等一两天跑五六次才能买到东西，最少的也要等半天。半数合作社都不能使社员随便挑拣而感到不方便；加以货种不全，不能满足社员要求。以致在市价平稳时，有的社员感到便宜有限，便到市场去买。根据石景山钢铁厂、自来水公司、清河制呢厂和电信局等四个典型社的调查，八月份合作社销货量平均只占社员工资总额的百分之三三·六六。如合作社能灵活更动物价，保持和市价的一定的距离，能随时都准备各种合乎需要的粮食，能随着季节变化而预备煤炭、布匹、副食品，及各种日常用品，则社员的购买量还可大大增加。
    某些合作社，曾发挥创造性，多方面开展业务。如被服厂自己按电磨，保证社员吃好面；自来水公司自己买煤作煤球，并添卖车子零件；石景山发电厂办“折实储蓄”；都得到社员拥护。本报合作社替社员办理澡堂及理发；电信局合作社搞食堂、书籍部、缝纫部，也都得到社员的拥护。
    在简化买货手续方面，经验证明必须发挥小组作用。电信局合作社和铁路局前门区合作社，都有一万多社员，但他们把粮食交给小组或分站，由他们再去分给大家。汽车修配厂把全体社员分成三天取粮，由组长集合口袋，挂上纸片写明每人需要之粮食种类及数目，由合作社逐一装好，下班后拿走，省得社员误工来等；每次发工资前五天统计买粮数，前三天分完粮食，发完工资后小组长代收货款总汇交合作社，又快又好，社员称便。
    食粮公司为了扶植合作社发展，决定按批发价再低百分之四，并准许赊帐十天。由于物价一般是平稳上涨，所以合作社都赚了“行市”。合作社的盈余一部分应该开支干部薪金及营业费，逐渐作到自力更生，克服依赖行政开支的不正常现象。主要部分应扩大业务经营，以进一步满足社员需要。更可办家属缝洗部，贷款扶植家属生产等，都是对社员有很大益处的。
  　三、合作社的物价问题
    目前各社对货价之决定，一般有四种类型：第一种是按来价出售。这种办法是很拙笨的，因市价跌落时社员会不满意，市价上涨时就要赔钱。第二种是随食粮公司牌价每天变动。这样又有些营利观点，不能给先后购买社员以均等机会，势必形成挤购现象。第三种是根据社员人数，规定三天或五天不变价，使大家在规定时间内买到同样之粮食，过期之后随牌价调整，合作社也可保住实物。这个办法较好。第四种是随时赊给社员各种货物，到发工资前一天统一划价扣款。这个办法最好，一则方便社员、增大社员购货量；二则减少现款收支，和会计科及银行可使用支票转帐，对通货回笼和稳定市价作用很大。
    四、合作社和各方面的关系问题
    和行政方面：多数合作社都得到行政的大力帮助，拨给房子、家具；借给资金或配备干部等；并有一多半给干部支薪，还有的供给办公品。因为合作社解决了职工的物资供给，他们也就更安心的生产，因此，行政上大力扶植合作社是完全正确的。但也有少数厂方，扶植很差，会计上不与往来，不给干部；有的合作社成立了半年连房子都未解决，和伙房挤在一起，无法添置货物，直接影响到业务开展和社员福利。
    和工会方面：合作社与工会福利部的目标相同，必须取得工会的直接帮助和领导（劳保委员参加社委会），才能密切联系群众，得到群众的支持与信仰；工会更应通过组织系统，发动会员“大家办合作社”。但如铁路前门区，把合作社当成工会的组成部分，一切联系群众的事都通过福利干事，只对工会负责，这也是偏向。
    和市总社方面：合作社是民主集中制的群众经济组织，除了接受由社员群众产生的“社委会”管理之外，还应受市总社的经常领导，这是不容丝毫忽视的。所以必须和总社密切结合才能成为一个完整的统一体，才能发挥减免中间剥削，保证职工生活，配合国营经济，平抑市场物价之作用。自来水公司及电信局合作社，因为经常向总社请示和联系，业务上都得到很大发展，这是一个有力证明。
    和社员及小组长的关系：社员是合作社的服务对象，合作社干部是社员的勤务员，必须明确这个关系，虚心、和蔼、热情地去接待社员，并随时征询他们对合作社的意见，了解他们的要求，以改进业务。小组长是合作社的基层干部，是合作社和社员之间的桥梁，必须健全这个环节，帮助小组长开会，提高小组长威信，并发挥小组的作用，才能巩固合作社的基础。自来水公司合作社在这一点上是作得比较成功的。
    五、合作社的干部问题
    街道社的干部，多由各区三轮工会筹委担任，他是经社员选举产生的。工资以一般三轮工人平均收入为标准，每日三斤到五斤小米。现全市五十一社中共有干部二三六人，大多能发挥艰苦朴素，一心为社员服务的精神，并得到社员拥护，但也有个别的，当了干部就轻视劳动；少数社会计能力较差，不能胜任，这些现象，现已逐步纠正。
    职工社的干部，一般都是本部门职工，且多由行政开支。由于在半年的经营中，多数社都有盈余，行政方面提出自力更生问题，合作社感到是一个“压力”，其实照目前情况看来，这一点已可能作到，如汽车厂修配厂合作社只从百分之四的折扣中还能开支两三个人。
    技术研究机关的合作社干部，都不愿脱离技术，要求总社给派干部；公用事业机关的合作社职工，因资历老，薪金相当高，四五百斤以上的很多，形成全市合作干部薪金悬殊的现象。铁路局前门区等社，由各部门选派代表组成合作社，三月一改选，这样不能培养干部的事业心；有的人怕将来回不到原来部门，怕失业，对整个工作的开展前途受影响。而比较普遍的问题是：工作生疏又忙于事务，不能进行业务学习，所以发生过个人英雄主义，影响业务发展，和只顾本位利益，超量多买等现象。这都是由于政治认识不够，不能掌握新民主主义的合作政策所致，近来好多干部提出学习要求，总社也打算用组织轮训及召开业务研究会的形式，来帮助提高合作社干部的政策水平和经营能力。
    六、社员教育问题
    合作社是一个新的工作，它和旧社会的合作社究竟有那些不同，社员群众是认识不足的。好多社员只从个人利益打算，发生到合作社去投机的行为。市价疲落时，他自己填表登记的粮食也不去买；市价上涨时，蜂拥到合作社算老帐，埋怨合作社为何不积存大批粮食，要求把以前弃权的粮食一下买走；还有少数社员认为到合作社买东西是“低头”，差不了几个钱干脆到市场去买省得麻烦；有的人借了合作社新口袋掉换成旧口袋，或用破了才送回；这些都是对合作社认识不足的表现。因此必须加强社员教育，利用买货、闲谈、墙报、布告、小组会及群众大会等一切机会，来宣传合作社是大家的，号召大家爱护合作社，用主人翁的态度来管理合作社。这是目前合作运动的迫切任务之一。
