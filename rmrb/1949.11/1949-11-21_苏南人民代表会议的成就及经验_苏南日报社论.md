　　Achievements and Experiences of the Southern Jiangsu People's Representative Conference
    ——Southern Jiangsu Daily Editorial
    【Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 20th】The Southern Jiangsu Daily published an editorial on the 15th entitled "Experiences of the Southern Jiangsu All-Circles People's Representative Conference," commenting on the achievements and experiences of the Southern Jiangsu People's Representative Conference held from October 25th to 31st. The editorial first pointed out: The first plenary session of the Southern Jiangsu All-Circles People's Representative Conference was an unprecedented meeting in the history of Southern Jiangsu and also the first relatively large-scale all-region all-circles People's Representative Conference in the new Hua Dong area. This conference was convened on the basis of the all-circles People's Representative Conferences held in various cities and some counties in Southern Jiangsu, and it had great gains, mainly manifested in the following aspects: First, the Common Program formulated by the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference was widely studied, which raised the political and policy levels of the representatives present and made it easier to reach a consensus when the conference discussed policies such as rent reduction and autumn grain collection. Second, the report of Comrade Chen Pixian, Secretary of the CPC Southern Jiangsu District Committee, on the "Future Work Guidelines and Autumn-Winter Work Tasks of Southern Jiangsu," was repeatedly studied by the preparatory committee and fully deliberated and discussed by all representatives, and thus received unanimous agreement and support. The conference also suggested that the Southern Jiangsu People's Government fully accept this report as the government's future policy guidelines and the autumn-winter work tasks. This fully embodies and demonstrates the leadership role of the Chinese Communist Party over people of all strata and the democratic regime, and through this representative conference, it will quickly and effectively transmit this policy and task to the people of all strata, gain the support of the broad masses, and become the people's own program of action. Third, the representatives present included a wide range of people. Communist Party members and non-Party members and representatives of various democratic classes had a wide opportunity to contact each other and jointly consult on major construction plans for Southern Jiangsu in a spirit of unity. This greatly strengthened the Southern Jiangsu People's Democratic United Front and demonstrated the concrete development from the National People's Political Consultative Conference to the local People's Political Consultative Conferences. Fourth, the representatives brought a total of 1,285 proposals to the conference, most of which were valuable opinions worthy of attention. After research, most of them were adopted by the government, which will be of great help to the future work of Southern Jiangsu. They enable the government to better understand all aspects of social life and the many problems that currently exist, to more comprehensively and properly take care of the interests of the people of all strata, and to more effectively promote future work.

    The editorial continued: This conference has gained the following experiences: First, sufficient preparatory work must be done before the representative conference is held. The important reason why this conference was able to achieve such success is that all-circles People's Representative Conferences had been held in various cities and some counties before the conference, which prepared the ideological and organizational foundations. At the same time, the leading comrades of the Party, government, and military, as well as figures from all walks of life, were concentrated to jointly plan and carry out various necessary preparatory work. In particular, the responsible comrades of the Party, government, and military in Southern Jiangsu were extremely serious and responsible in the progress of the conference and in discussing various issues, repeatedly researching and consulting with representatives from all sides in a sincere and frank manner, so that the preparatory work was done relatively fully in major aspects, and the conference proceeded smoothly.

    Second, the representative conference must fully promote democracy. At this conference, the leading organs paid attention to the appropriate combination of the general assembly and group meetings. The group meetings adopted regional units, while also holding various symposiums based on the different occupations and class nature of the representatives, to supplement the deficiencies of the general assembly. This democratic method is very good. It allows each representative to have a fuller opportunity to speak, which is a concrete application of the principle of democratic centralism.

    Third, when discussing issues, attention must be paid to grasping the key points, and at the same time, other secondary issues should be resolved in connection with the central issues, and issues that can be postponed should be transferred to a certain organization to be handled, so as to distinguish between priorities and urgencies. The discussion at this conference mainly focused on important issues such as rent reduction, autumn grain collection, and rectification of urban taxation, and efforts were made to thoroughly resolve these issues. When handling the proposals of the conference, because this principle was grasped, it was suggested that the government or relevant departments quickly implement matters that must be handled urgently; it was suggested that the government study or formulate plans for matters that can be postponed; it was suggested that the government thoroughly implement matters that have already been handled; and it was suggested that the government speed up matters that are being handled. Therefore, once it was reported to the conference, it received unanimous approval from the entire audience.

　　苏南人民代表会议的成就及经验
    ——苏南日报社论
    【新华社上海二十日电】苏南日报于十五日以“苏南各界人民代表会议的经验”为题发表社论，评论在上月二十五日到三十一日举行的苏南人民代表会议的成就和经验。该社论首先指出：苏南各界人民代表会议第一届全体会议是苏南历史上一个空前的会议，也是华东新区第一个规模较大的全区性的各界人民代表会议；这个会议是在苏南各个市及若干县召开了各界人民代表会议基础之上召开的，有很大的收获，主要表现在以下各方面：一、普遍地研究了人民政协所制定的共同纲领，使到会代表的政治水平和政策水平提高了一步，并使这次会议讨论减租、秋征等政策时，意见容易趋于一致。二、这次中共苏南区党委书记陈丕显同志在会议上所提出的“苏南今后工作方针与今年秋冬两季工作任务”的报告，经过筹备会一再研究及全体代表充分酝酿和讨论，因而获得了全体一致的同意和拥护。大会并建议苏南人民政府全部接受这个报告作为今后政府的施政方针和今年秋冬两季的工作任务，这就充分地体现了和发挥了中国共产党对各阶层人民和民主政权的领导作用，并将通过这个代表会议迅速而有效地把这个方针和任务传达到各阶层人民中去，取得广大人民群众的拥护，成为人民自己的行动纲领。三、这次到会代表包括的范围很广泛，共产党员和党外人士及各民主阶层代表互相之间，有了一个广泛接触的机会，在团结一致的精神下，共同协商有关苏南的建设大计。这就大大地增强了苏南人民民主统一战线，表现了从全国人民政协到地方人民政协的具体发展。四、在这次会议中各界代表所带来的提案共有一千二百八十五件，其中极大部分都是值得重视的宝贵意见，经过研究以后，大都被政府所采纳，这对于苏南今后工作将有很大的帮助。它们使政府能够更清楚地了解社会生活各方面以及目前存在着的许多问题，能够更全面地更妥善地照顾各阶层人民的利益并更有效地推进今后的工作。
    社论继称：这次会议取得了如下的经验：第一、代表会议举行之前必须有充分的准备工作。这次会议所以能够获得这样的成就，其重要原因之一，就在于会议之前已在各城市及若干县份召开了各界人民代表会议，这就准备了思想基础与组织基础；同时又集中了党政军和各界人物共策进行各项必要的准备工作，特别是苏南党政军负责同志对于会议的进行和在讨论各种问题时都极为认真负责，以诚恳坦白的态度，同各方面代表反复研究，一再协商，使准备工作在主要方面做得比较充分，并使会议进行得顺利。
    第二、代表会议必须充分发扬民主。在这次会议上，领导机关注意到大会和小组会的适当结合，小组会采取了以区域为单位，同时又按代表职业、阶层性质的不同，举行各种座谈会议，以补助大会之不足，这种民主方式是很好的。他可以让每个代表都得到更充分的发言机会，这是民主集中制原则的具体运用。
    第三、讨论问题时必须注意掌握重点，同时围绕着中心问题有联系地解决其他次要问题和将可以缓办的问题移交到一定的组织待办，以分别轻重缓急。这次会议的讨论，主要集中到减租、秋征与整顿城市税收等重要问题，对于这些问题力求彻底解决。当着处理大会提案时，由于掌握了这个原则，将必须急办的事情建议政府或有关部门迅速执行；可以缓办的事情建议政府予以研究或订出计划；已经办了的事情建议政府确实贯彻；正在办理的事情建议政府加紧进行。因而一经向大会报告，即获得了全场一致的赞同。
