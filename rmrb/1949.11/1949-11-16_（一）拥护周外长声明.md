　　(I) Support Foreign Minister Zhou's Statement
    Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement to the United Nations yesterday is bound to have a huge and positive impact on current international relations. This is a sacred and solemn declaration made by the Chinese people to all mankind. It not only signifies that the Chinese people, who account for a quarter of the world's population, will henceforth directly participate in international affairs based truly on their own will and aspirations, but also signifies that the great cause of lasting peace and people's democracy, which the people of the world are unanimously pursuing, will henceforth receive more active and direct support from the 475 million Chinese people. All peace-loving and democratic countries and people around the world will warmly welcome and support this statement, while the imperialists and their lackeys will be intimidated by this statement and tremble even more.
    The United Nations organization was originally established by various countries after World War II to ensure world peace and security. The Chinese people made great contributions in the war against German, Italian, and Japanese fascism, and it is entirely appropriate for them to occupy a prominent position in the United Nations. However, the Kuomintang reactionary government stole the fruits of the Chinese people's victory, and thus also stole the legitimate status and rights that the Chinese people deserved in the international arena. The Kuomintang reactionaries, under the guise of a "government," have been swindling and bluffing on the international political stage for a long time and have long been spurned by the people of the world. Not only did it make no contribution to the purposes stipulated in the United Nations Charter, namely, "to maintain international peace and security," but, on the contrary, with the support of imperialism, it constantly carried out heinous activities that undermined international peace and security, undermining the efforts made by the countries truly upholding the United Nations Charter, led by the Soviet Union, to consolidate international cooperation both inside and outside the United Nations. The Chinese people have long been unable to tolerate all these perverse actions of the Kuomintang reactionaries. The Chinese people believe that the so-called "government" once established in China by the Kuomintang reactionaries was not actually a government at all, but merely a company of thieves, and it should not have any qualifications to represent China in any activities internationally. In the past, the United Nations allowed the so-called "representatives" of the Kuomintang reactionaries to masquerade as representatives of China in the United Nations, which was entirely a historical error, and this error should now be corrected.
    Now it is universally known that the Chinese people have stood up. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese People's Liberation War and the People's Great Revolution have achieved decisive victories throughout the country. The company of thieves opened in China by the Kuomintang reactionaries declared bankruptcy as early as April this year when the People's Liberation Army liberated Nanjing. The remaining small group of Kuomintang rogue bandits, who temporarily hung up a broken signboard in Guangzhou, were shattered by the liberation of Guangzhou. Therefore, even the Kuomintang reactionary remnant government has basically perished, and what remains is only the remnants of the remnants, which will soon be completely eliminated. This is an unprecedented fundamental change in the Chinese political situation, and the fact of this change is witnessed by the people of the world. More importantly, the Chinese people have already convened the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in accordance with their own will and aspirations, established the People's Republic of China, and produced the Central People's Government. At the plenary session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, a resolution was unanimously adopted to the effect that the Central People's Government should send a telegram to the United Nations General Assembly declaring that the Central People's Government elected by the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is the only government that can represent the Chinese people, and denying the representative qualifications of all representatives sent by the Kuomintang reactionary remnant government to attend the United Nations General Assembly. In the proclamation of the Central People's Government issued by Chairman Mao Zedong on October 1st of this year, he solemnly declared to the world: "This government is the only legal government representing the entire people of the People's Republic of China." Now, not only are all the Chinese people unanimously and warmly supporting their own Central People's Government, but the progressive people of the world are also warmly celebrating the birth of New China, and many advanced countries have already established diplomatic relations with our country. This clearly shows that the Kuomintang reactionary remnant government has completely lost its position in China. Therefore, the so-called "delegation" sent by it to the United Nations obviously has no legal or factual basis to represent the Chinese people.
    We fully support Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement to the United Nations, and we cannot allow the desperadoes of the bankrupt company of thieves of old China to continue swindling and bluffing in the United Nations. If the representatives of the remnant of the Kuomintang remnants, such as Jiang Tingfu and his ilk, are allowed to stand in international conferences, we believe that this is an insult to the Chinese people and will never be permitted. If anyone still advocates retaining the "representative" qualifications of those desperadoes in the United Nations General Assembly, they are openly adopting an unfriendly attitude towards the Chinese people, and they will bear all the consequences arising therefrom. The Chinese people resolutely demand the immediate cancellation of all the "representative" rights of the Kuomintang reactionary remnant government in the United Nations. All these rights belong to the Chinese people. The Kuomintang reactionaries stole these rights of the Chinese people, and the Chinese people have the right to immediately take them all back and hand them over to their own Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China to send their own representatives.

### （一）拥护周外长声明

　　（一）拥护周外长声明
    周恩来外长昨日向联合国所发出的声明，在目前的国际关系中，必然要发生一个巨大的积极的作用。这是中国人民向全人类发出的神圣庄严的宣告，这不仅表示着占世界人口四分之一的中国人民，真正根据自己的意志和愿望，从此将直接参与国际的事务；而且表示着世界人民所一致追求的持久和平与人民民主的伟大事业，将从此得到四万万七千五百万的中国人民更加积极的直接的支持。全世界爱好和平民主的国家与人民都一定会热烈欢呼与拥护这个声明，而帝国主义及其走卒们即将被这个声明所震慑而更加发抖起来。
    联合国的组织，本来是第二次世界大战以后，各国为了保障世界和平与安全而成立的。中国人民在反对德、意、日法西斯的战争中有着伟大的贡献，在联合国中占着显著的地位是完全应该的，但国民党反动政府，曾窃取了中国人民胜利的成果，因而也窃取了中国人民在国际上应得的合法地位和权利。国民党反动派假借了一个“政府”的名义，在国际政治舞台上招摇撞骗，早已为世界人民所唾弃。它不但对于联合国宪章所规定的宗旨，即“维持国际和平及安全”，毫无贡献，相反的，它在帝国主义的支持下，却曾不断地进行着破坏国际和平与安全的罪恶活动，破坏以苏联为首的真正维护联合国宪章的各国在联合国内外为巩固国际合作所进行的努力。中国人民对于国民党反动派的这一切倒行逆施，久已不能容忍。中国人民认为，国民党反动派在中国曾经建立的所谓“政府”，实际上并不是什么政府，而只是一个窃盗公司，它根本就不应该有任何资格来代表中国在国际上进行任何活动。前此联合国允许国民党反动派的所谓“代表”冒充中国的代表到联合国活动，这完全是一个历史的错误，这个错误现在是应该得到纠正的。
    现在举世周知，中国人民是已经站起来了。由于中国共产党的领导，使中国人民解放战争和人民大革命在全国范围内取得了决定性的胜利，国民党反动派在中国所开设的窃盗公司早在今年四月人民解放军解放南京时就已宣告倒闭了，残余的一小撮国民党流氓土匪，逃窜广州临时挂起的破招牌，又由于广州的解放而被粉碎，因此，现在就连国民党反动残余政府也已基本灭亡，所剩下的只是残余的残余，不久即将全部被消灭了。这是中国政治情势空前的根本的大变化，这个变化的事实是全世界人民所共见的。而更重要的是，中国人民业已按照自己的意志和愿望，召开了中国人民政治协商会议，成立了中华人民共和国，产生了中央人民政府。在中国人民政治协商会议的全体会议上，曾一致通过决议，由中央人民政府致电联合国大会，宣告中国人民政协所选举的中央人民政府为唯一能代表中国人民的政府，并否认国民党反动残余政府所派遣出席联合国大会的所有代表的代表资格。在毛泽东主席在本年十月一日所发表的中央人民政府公告中，郑重地向全世界宣布：“本政府为代表中华人民共和国全国人民的唯一合法政府”，现在，不仅全中国人民都一致热烈拥护自己的中央人民政府，而且世界各国进步的人民也都在热烈庆贺新中国的诞生，许多先进国家已经和我国建立了外交关系。这就极明显地说明了国民党反动残余政府已经完全丧失了它在中国的地位，因此，由它所派遣的在联合国的所谓“代表团”显然就没有代表中国人民的任何法律的和事实的根据了。
    我们完全拥护周恩来外长向联合国发出的声明，我们不能容许旧中国破产了的窃盗公司的亡命徒，继续在联合国招摇撞骗。如果再让国民党残余之残余的流亡分子的代表，如蒋廷黻之流，在国际会议中立足，我们认为这是对中国人民的一个侮辱，是决不许可的。如果有谁还主张在联合国大会中保留那些亡命徒的“代表”资格，谁就是公然对中国人民采取不友好的态度、谁就将承当由此所产生的一切后果。中国人民坚决要求立即取消国民党反动残余政府在联合国的“代表”的一切权利。这一切权利是属于中国人民的，国民党反动派窃取了中国人民的这些权利，中国人民有权将它立即全部收回，交由中国人民自己所建立的中华人民共和国的中央人民政府派出自己的代表。
