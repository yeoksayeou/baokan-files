Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 13th. With the victorious progress of the People's Armed Guerrilla struggle, South Korean peasants have begun to hold large-scale uprisings, automatically rising up to liquidate reactionary landlords and distribute land.

On October 29th, in Tanyang County and Nogwang County in the northern part of Jeolla Province, more than 7,500 peasants carried out armed uprisings, and are rapidly developing towards various areas of Jeolla Province and North Jeolla Province. The first to raise the banner of uprising were more than 1,500 peasants in Subuk District of Tanyang County. After their uprising on the morning of October 29th, they immediately received the response of more than 3,000 peasants from 46 villages in other districts of the county. The peasants rose up in unison, with the force of an angry tide, and in coordination with the People's Guerrilla forces, liquidated reactionary landlords, usurers, special agents, reactionary officials, and puppet military police, confiscating their property, land and land deeds, and occupying the branches of the "Democratic Nationalist Party", "National Defense Army" and "Civil Defense Corps". The 4,500 peasants shouted slogans such as "Let us implement land reform like in North Korea ourselves" and "Eliminate the Syngman Rhee bandits." They held mass meetings, publicly tried some of the reactionary elements they had captured alive, and unanimously passed a resolution to confiscate the landlords' land and distribute it to the peasants without compensation.

At 6:00 a.m. on the same day, more than 3,000 peasants in Daema District of Nogwang County also rose up in response. In cooperation with the People's Guerrilla forces, they first eliminated the reactionary elements in the district, and then, on the one hand, confiscated the landlords' land, land deeds, and account books, and on the other hand, attacked the puppet police station and destroyed the puppet district office. The mobile units dispatched by the Nogwang County puppet police station were completely annihilated by the People's Guerrilla forces and the uprising peasants.

Now, the flag of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is flying over the villages of Tanyang and Nogwang counties.
