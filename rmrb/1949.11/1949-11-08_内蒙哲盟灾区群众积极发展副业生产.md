    [This Newspaper News] Under the call for production for self-relief, the masses in the disaster areas of Zhemeng League, Inner Mongolia, are actively participating in various productions. After villages in the riverine areas of Kailu, Tongliao, and other places were flooded, they immediately organized sideline production. For example, more than 130 women in Sanhe Village, Fourth District of Kailu, picked more than 18 *shi* and 9 *dou* of grass seeds and dried more than 500 *jin* of dried vegetables in seven days. In addition to cutting grass and doing odd jobs, male laborers drove 16 carts to Tianshan to haul salt. They unanimously stated: "Although the land is flooded, we must engage in sideline production to lay the foundation for next year's production." Yong'an Village, Eighth District, Tongliao, suffered five consecutive floods this summer. Because the village, both men and women, young and old, carried out sideline production in an organized manner, not only did they solve the current difficulties, but they also built 64 new houses. The men and women, young and old, of Haban Yingzi Village, Production Village, Yuliangbao District, Tongliao, are now preparing to weave 4,500 pairs of straw sandals in preparation for next year's production. Liu Yushan, a *lv* in Dalin District, exchanged more than 5 *shi* of grain for sideline production. Ten administrative villages in Henan, Wujiazi District, picked more than 85 *shi* of grass seeds. The main reasons for the above achievements are the active calls and organizational leadership of the Party and the government, which made the masses experience the benefits of sideline production in practice and improved their confidence in production for self-relief. Secondly, the village cadres and party members played an active leading role in promoting production. For example, Wang Suqin, the women's director of Fuhe Village, Seventh District of Kailu, led more than 170 women to pick more than 80 *shi* of grass seeds. Yu Suqing, a party member in Production Village, Yuliangbao District, led ten women to cut more than 2,000 bundles of cattails in five days. This greatly promoted the masses' participation in production for self-relief.

　　内蒙哲盟灾区群众积极发展副业生产
    【本报讯】在生产自救号召下，内蒙古哲盟各灾区群众，积极参加各种生产。开鲁、通辽等地沿河区村遭水灾后，即组织副业生产，如开鲁四区三合村一百三十余名妇女，七天工夫拣了十八石九斗草籽，晒了五百多斤干菜，男劳力除打草做工外，出车十六辆到天山去拉盐。他们一致提出：“地虽被淹，一定要搞副业打下明年生产基础”。八区永安村今夏连续遭受五次水灾，由于该村男女老少有组织的展开了副业生产，不但解决了当前困难，而且又盖出六十四间房子。通辽余粮堡区生产村哈番营子屯男女老少，现正准备编四千五百双草鞋，准备来年生产。钱家店区东才道木闾组成打鱼小组，每天打鱼可卖四万多元。大林区一闾刘玉山，搞副业生产换回五石多粮。五家子区河南十个行政村，拣草籽八十五石多。获得以上成绩的主要原因，是党与政府的积极号召和组织领导，使群众在实际中体验到副业生产的好处，提高了生产自救的信心。其次是各村干部党员，起了积极带头推动作用，如开鲁七区富合村妇女主任王素琴，带起一百七十多名妇女拣草籽八十多石。余粮堡区生产村党员于素卿带起十名妇女，五天工夫割了两千多捆蒲草。对群众参加生产自救推动很大。
