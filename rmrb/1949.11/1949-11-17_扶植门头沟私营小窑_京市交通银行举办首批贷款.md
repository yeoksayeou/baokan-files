　　Supporting Private Coal Kilns in Mentougou
  　Beijing Jiaotong Bank Issues First Batch of Loans
    [Our Dispatch] In order to support the resumption of production of private coal kilns in Mentougou and to subsidize Beijing's coal consumption this winter, the Beijing Jiaotong Bank has launched its first batch of loans. After the Mentougou mining area was flooded this summer, the low-lying areas of the mines are still being drained, resulting in a decrease in Mentougou coal production. Jiaotong Bank, in cooperation with the Jingxi Mining Bureau and Jingxi Coal Mining Company, selected more than ten private coal kilns in the Quanximen area as support targets on September 21, based on the terrain of the mining area and the specific conditions of each kiln. Loan procedures began on October 7. As of the 10th of this month, loans of 17.3 million yuan have been issued, benefiting thirteen coal kilns including Fuchun, Sanhe, Deshun, Huaxing, Xingmao, Desheng, Hongfeng, Hechun, Yongsheng, Baotian, Tongyixing, Baofu, and Mingji. After receiving the loans, these coal kilns immediately began purchasing kiln pillars or repairing kiln roads. Kilns with simpler repair projects, such as Hongfeng and Sanhe, will be able to produce coal soon. Those with more complex projects are rushing to repair them. It is expected that all of them will resume production in one month. It is estimated that the minimum daily output will be more than 400 tons of coal.

　　扶植门头沟私营小窑
  　京市交通银行举办首批贷款
    【本报讯】京交通银行为扶植门头沟私营小窑恢复生产，以补助京市今冬用煤，特举办首批贷款。门头沟矿区今夏被水浸淹后，地势低洼，各矿现仍从事排水，门煤产量因而减少。交通银行配合京西矿务处及京西煤矿公司，于九月二十一日根据该矿区地势及各窑目前具体状况，选择圈西门一带之私营煤窑十余家为扶植对象，于十月七日开始办理贷款手续。截至本月十日，已发放贷款一千七百三十万元，受益煤窑有福春、三合、德顺、华兴、兴茂、德盛、宏丰、和纯、永生、宝天、同义兴、宝福、明记等十三家。这些煤窑获得贷款后，即开始购买窑柱或修理窑道。修整工程简易者如宏丰、三合等窑，最近即可出煤。工程较繁者，正兴工赶修。预计一个月后即能全部恢复生产。估计最低每日将能产煤四百余吨。
