    [Our Newspaper's Report] Li Jishen, Li Renren, Chen Shaoxian, Chen Cisheng, and Lü Jiyi telegraphed General Lin Biao to congratulate him on the victory of the liberation of Guilin. The telegram reads as follows: General Lin Biao and all commanders and fighters: We are delighted to learn that our army, with swift action, has recovered Guilin, which had been occupied by Li and Bai for more than 20 years, and shattered the remnants of the bandits' attempts to resist stubbornly in Liuzhou and Nanning. The 14 million people in dire straits in the entire province are about to be liberated. The good news has arrived, and we are overjoyed and encouraged. Li and Bai have always considered themselves to be powerful anti-people forces, and American imperialism has pinned its last hopes on them. This victory of our army is truly sufficient to clarify international understanding. We extend our highest respect to you.
