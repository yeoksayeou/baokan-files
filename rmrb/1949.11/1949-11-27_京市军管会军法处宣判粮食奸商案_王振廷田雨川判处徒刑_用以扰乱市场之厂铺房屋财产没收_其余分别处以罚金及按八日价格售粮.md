[Beijing News] The Military Law Department of the Beijing Military Control Commission of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, in order to implement the resolutions of the Second Beijing People's Representative Conference and severely punish profiteers, has tried the case of profiteers Wang Zhenting, Tian Yuchuan, Tian Bolin, and others for fraudulently purchasing wheat from the Grain Company, hoarding and refusing to sell, and raising grain prices. The verdict was announced at 1:40 AM this morning (27th): Profiteer Wang Zhenting was sentenced to five years in prison and deprived of civil rights for five years. His Changshun Flour Mill, Yongshengfu Grain Store, Yongshengde Grain Store, Yongshenghou Grain Store, and other four-branch stores' occupied houses, as well as all property within the stores, were confiscated. Profiteer Tian Yuchuan was sentenced to four and a half years of imprisonment and deprived of civil rights for three and a half years. The properties at No. 13 and 14, Shiban Hutong, Chongwai, which he used to disrupt the market, as well as the Wanyuhou Flour Mill, along with all materials, tools, furniture, and sundries, and more than 500,000 jin of wheat and more than 20,000 bags of flour currently in storage, were all confiscated. Profiteer Tian Bolin was fined 10 million yuan for hoarding, refusing to sell, and raising prices. All 204 bags of miscellaneous grains and 24 bags of flour he owns will be retailed to citizens at the retail price listed in the People's Daily on the 8th of this month. Qu Yaoting was fined 7.5 million yuan for raising prices and refusing to sell. His 25,000 jin of miscellaneous grains and 500 bags of Tong flour will be retailed at the price on the 8th. Wu Zizhong was fined 7.5 million yuan for hoarding and raising prices. His 800 bags of flour will be retailed at the price on the 8th. Tian Yu Zeng was ordered to release 15,000 jin of miscellaneous grains at the price on the 8th for raising prices. Fan Zihe was ordered to release 12,000 jin of miscellaneous grains at the price on the 8th for hoarding and raising prices. Yang Weisan was fined 5 million yuan for raising prices and disrupting the market, and ordered to release 5,000 jin of flour at the price on the 8th. Lü Aiting was fined 4 million yuan for raising prices beyond the scope of business and ordered to release 20,000 jin of miscellaneous grains at the price on the 8th. Li Jingjun was ordered to release 150 bags of flour at the price on the 8th for hoarding and refusing to sell.

　　Profiteer Wang Zhenting habitually manipulated prices for personal gain, and was a notorious "grain tiger" in Beijing, hated by the affected citizens. On the 27th of last month, taking advantage of the epidemic prevention blockade in Beijing, he again used his habitual trick of falsely selling Tong flour to fraudulently purchase a large amount of wheat from the Grain Company. On November 11th, he released 678 bags of flour on the market, of which 230 bags were bought back by his branches Yongshengde, Yongshengfu, Yongshenghou, etc., in order to fraudulently purchase the Grain Company's low-priced wheat. At the same time, he also used a dud check of 5.84 million yuan from Quanju Hou Silver Shop to resell flour off-market. His Changshun Flour Mill had more than 500,000 jin of grain and 838 bags of flour in stock, but refused to sell at the door from the 10th of this month, and on the 11th, sold it to his branch Yongshengfu at a unit price of 23,500 yuan, and then Yongshengfu sold it at a high price of 36,000 yuan per bag. On the 12th, he snapped up 44,760 jin of wheat in one day for hoarding and speculation to drive up grain prices.

　　Profiteer Tian Yuchuan hoarded and refused to sell. Before November 8th, his Wanyuhou Flour Mill had more than 561,000 jin of wheat and 323 bags of flour in stock, but from the 8th to the 12th, he continued to snap up more than 210,000 jin of wheat and more than 300 bags of flour. However, Tian Yuchuan stopped selling flour at the door from the 11th, and at the same time used his brother's Yuanshuncheng Rice and Grain Store to drive up grain prices. The wholesale market price of flour was 22,500 yuan per bag, but Yuanshuncheng raised it to 44,000 yuan. Obviously, it was deliberately raising grain prices to make huge profits, regardless of the life and death of the people.

　　京市军管会军法处宣判粮食奸商案
  　王振廷田雨川判处徒刑
    用以扰乱市场之厂铺房屋财产没收
    其余分别处以罚金及按八日价格售粮
    【北京讯】中国人民解放军北京市军事管制委员会军法处为执行北京市第二届各界人民代表会议决议，严惩奸商，审理奸商王振廷、田雨川、田柏林等十人套购粮食公司小麦，囤积拒售、高抬粮价一案，已于今（二十七日）晨一时四十分宣判：奸商王振廷处徒刑五年，褫夺公民权五年，并将其长顺面粉厂、永盛福粮店、永盛德粮店、永盛厚粮店等四联号所占之房屋以及铺内所有一切财产全部没收。奸商田雨川，处有期徒刑四年半，褫夺公民权三年半，其所利用进行扰乱市场之崇外石板胡同十三、十四两号房产，以及万裕厚制粉厂一座，连同该号所有一切物资、工具、家具什物，并现存小麦，五十余万斤，面粉二万余袋，均予全部没收。奸商田柏林因囤积拒售、哄抬物价，处罚金一千万元，其所有之杂粮二百零四包，面粉二十四袋按本月八日人民日报零售价格零售给市民。曲耀亭抬价拒售，处罚金七百五十万元，其所有之杂粮二万五千斤、通粉五百袋，按八日价零售。武子忠囤积抬价，处罚金七百五十万元，其所有之面粉八百袋按八日价零售。田裕曾抬高物价提出杂粮一万五千斤按八日价零售。范子和囤积抬价，处以提出杂粮一万二千斤，按八日价零售。杨畏三哄抬物价、扰乱市场、处以罚金五百万元，提出面粉五千斤按八日价零售。吕蔼庭高抬物价，超出营业范围，处以罚金四百万元，提出杂粮二万斤按八日价零售。李敬钧囤积拒售，处以提出面粉一百五十袋按八日价零售。
    按奸商王振廷惯以操纵物价，暴利自肥，为北京有名的粮老虎，受害的市民莫不痛恨。上月二十七日该犯乘京市防疫封锁，又施惯技、假卖通粉，套购粮食公司大批小麦。于十一月十一日在市场抛出面粉六百七十八袋，其中却有二百三十袋为其联号永盛德、永盛福、永盛厚等买回，借以套购粮食公司廉价小麦。同时更利用全聚厚银号五百八十四万元之空头支票，在场外倒卖面粉。其长顺面粉厂存粮五十余万斤，面粉八百三十八袋，但从本月十日起即拒售门市，十一日更以二万三千五百元之单价卖与其联号永盛福，再由永盛福以每袋三万六千元的高价出售。十二日一天内抢购小麦四万四千七百六十斤，用以囤积居奇，哄抬粮价。
    奸商田雨川囤积拒售，十一月八日前，其开设的万裕厚面粉厂存小麦五十六万一千余斤，面粉三百二十三袋，但自八日起至十二日犹连续抢购小麦二十一万余斤，面粉三百余袋。但该田雨川自十一日起即停止门市卖面，同时更利用其兄弟开设之元顺成米粮店，哄抬粮价，面粉每袋市场批发价为二万二千五百元，元顺成竟抬高到四万四千元。显然是故意抬高粮价，获取暴利，不顾人民的死活。
