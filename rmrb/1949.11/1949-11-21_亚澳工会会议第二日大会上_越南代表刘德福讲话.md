Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 20th -- The full text of the speech by Vietnamese representative Liu Defu at the second day of the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference is as follows:

　　Dear Comrades:

　　First, please allow me to thank the members of the Executive Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions attending this conference, and also to thank Comrades Vittorio and Kuznetsov, the President of the World Federation of Trade Unions, who were unable to attend. Because they have victoriously led the world's workers in the struggle against war and against splitters. This struggle is both for the unity of our working class, for safeguarding our rights, for improving the living and working conditions of all workers in the world, and also for defending the democracy and peace of all people in the world. Because of their strong and continuous actions, we—the representatives of Asian and Australian countries—are now able to gather here and create a new era in the history of the Asian-Australian trade unions.

　　On behalf of the Vietnamese delegation, I would like to thank the Chinese working class and their wise leaders for their enthusiastic efforts in organizing this epoch-making Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference. This conference is being held in the same hall where the great Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference was held not long ago, and in this venue, the cheers of the Chinese people for the new People's Republic are still resounding.

　　Here, I would like to report some facts based on the opinions of our delegation. These facts have already been mentioned by Comrade Saillant, and I completely agree with Comrade Saillant's opinions.

　　Yes, comrades, this conference is a universal victory for the international working class, especially for the working classes of Asia and Australia, because it gives a head-on blow to the masters of gold yuan and pounds.

　　Ever since the 1945 Paris World Federation of Trade Unions Congress first had the intention of organizing this conference, the masters of pounds and gold pounds have been trying to sabotage it. Because they feared that Asian workers would unite and become stronger.

　　Therefore, the imperialist agents who held high positions in the World Federation of Trade Unions opposed the clause in the World Federation of Trade Unions' work plan that called for convening an Asian conference. The American trade unions were then responsible for recommending representatives to work on colonial affairs. But in the past three years, of the three secretaries they sent, two never took office (these two were Brophy and Gillmore), and the other, named Goff, was simply lifeless and eventually left his post without any notice.

　　Also, figures like Deakin, Tewson, and Jouhaux, loyal lackeys of imperialism, left the World Federation of Trade Unions with the aim of undermining the international trade union movement. But their withdrawal not only did not weaken the strength of the World Federation of Trade Unions, but only made it easier for the World Federation of Trade Unions to move forward by removing the obstacles of traitors in the working class.

　　For the same purpose, these heads of the American Congress of Industrial Organizations, the American Federation of Labor, and the British Trades Union Congress tried every means to organize the so-called "Asian Labor League," relying on the strength of armed trade unions and placing this organization in the hands of the country's new fascist government.

　　They tried to hold a meeting in Raarhi, India, but it did not materialize. Another time, they wanted to hold it in Geneva, Switzerland, in June 1949, but suffered a miserable failure. Now, the agents of the imperialist governments in various countries, such as MacArthur in Japan and Hatta in Indonesia, still harbor a destructive purpose, prohibiting representatives from their respective countries from attending the conference. But this still cannot prevent the working masses from having their representatives here, and it cannot prevent the truth, because it does not need a passport to cross borders.

　　The reason why the reactionaries oppose this conference is undoubtedly the same as when their representatives were still participating in the World Federation of Trade Unions. They said that the Asian trade union conference is not a real trade union conference, and that the Asian-Australian conference is just a political conference. Only those who sell trade unions to the imperialist gold yuan magnates, only the traitors of the working class, only the instigators of war, only the trade unions organized by those who support the exploitation of the working class are not real trade unions! Traitors, you must know that we have a political nature because we want to defend the fruits of labor of all our people and the wealth of all the people of our country. We want to be political, and there is no trade union organization in the world that does not link its constant struggle to protect workers' rights with the broad struggle of all the people for peace and national independence. No force can stop the solidarity of the 1.05 billion people of Asia and Australia and the common front for their rights, freedom, and happiness. Dear comrades, this conference is declaring the death sentence on the splitters, and it is also affirming the inviolable rights of the working class. To achieve these successes, all trade union organizations must wage arduous struggles. Although we should not overestimate the strength of the imperialists, we should not underestimate it either. In Asia, due to the decisive victory achieved by the Chinese people and the Chinese working class, we can say that it has dealt a fatal blow to the imperialists. But there are still some points worth noting, especially in Southeast Asian countries, where the imperialists are still planning to strengthen their military bases, and their strength is still very strong. The road to their decisive victory is the road taken by the 475 million Chinese people.

　　The resolutions of the London Conference and the Paris Congress clearly stipulated the main tasks regarding colonies and dependent countries, and this resolution was repeatedly emphasized by the Second World Federation of Trade Unions Congress in Milan. Now, the World Federation of Trade Unions, in order to complete this task, must first avoid the sabotage of traitors in the working class. Therefore, this conference must first establish a liaison bureau and formulate an action plan in accordance with the resolutions of the World Federation of Trade Unions and the specific circumstances of the Asian-Australian trade union movement. Except for the Soviet republics in Asia, the worker movements in most countries are to be linked with the national independence struggle movement, the democratic struggle movement, and the anti-feudal and anti-imperialist oppression struggle movement. This struggle has been victorious in China, and is continuing in South Korea, Japan, the Philippines, Malaya, Burma, Indonesia, Vietnam... although under difficult conditions. In many places, bourgeois leaders skillfully use this struggle, but once their wishes are achieved, they become loyal lackeys of the imperialists and oppose the people. Moreover, they strike at the working class with oppression that is even more vicious and tyrannical than the open rule of imperialism in India, Indonesia, Burma, and the Philippines. Government-controlled trade unions, under the leadership of British and American trade unions that betray the workers, are directing a splitter action in the ranks of the workers. The task of this conference should be to expose the false democracy of the leaders now in power, denounce their obedience to imperialism, announce their anti-worker, anti-union oppressive measures, and request the World Federation of Trade Unions to force the United Nations to accept the demands of trade unions in various countries for freedom.

　　The task of this conference is to clearly tell the workers of Asian countries that the road to their liberation and the liberation of their people must be the same as that of the Chinese workers, that is, they can only succeed by directly participating in the people's liberation war.

　　At the same time, the conference must also emphasize that the movement for peace is very important in the sense of Asian national liberation. We must know that every victory won by the world's peace forces, whether it is every tractor produced by the Soviet Union or the people's democratic countries, every square kilometer of land liberated by the Chinese liberation war, or every demand of the workers in Britain, the United States, France, and Italy that is satisfied... these are all major blows to the imperialists and contribute to the liberation of the oppressed people.

　　Regarding the issue of establishing a permanent liaison bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions in China, the task of this permanent liaison bureau is to constantly check the struggles, work, and living conditions of the workers in Asia and Australia, so that it can bring the spiritual and material support of the world's workers to help them when necessary. The workers of the permanent liaison bureau must also ensure that the trade unions in Asian countries have constant and close ties with the World Federation of Trade Unions, so that they can exchange experiences with each other and unite the worker movements of various countries into one. For this purpose, we believe that it is also necessary for the permanent liaison bureau to constantly collect materials and carry out propaganda work, and to provide guidance to the publishing affairs of trade unions in Asian countries. It can send subcommittees to Asian countries to conduct investigation and research work. In these works, we believe that the All-China Federation of Trade Unions occupies an important position, so we propose that the permanent liaison bureau be located in Beijing.

　　Long live the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference!

　　Long live the World Federation of Trade Unions!

　　Long live international worker solidarity!

### 亚澳工会会议第二日大会上　越南代表刘德福讲话

　　亚澳工会会议第二日大会上
　　越南代表刘德福讲话
    【新华社北京二十日电】越南代表刘德福在亚澳工会会议第二日大会上的讲话全文如下：亲爱的同志们：
    首先请你们让我在这里谢谢出席这一次会议的世界工联执行局的各位委员，同时也谢谢未能出席的世界工联主席维特里奥和库兹涅佐夫同志。因为他们胜利地领导了世界工人，作反对战争和反对分裂分子的斗争。这斗争一面是为了我们工人阶级的团结，为了保障我们的权利，为了改善全世界所有工人的生活上的和工作上的条件，同时也是为了保卫全世界所有人民的民主与和平。由于他们这一种坚强的继续不断的行动，我们——亚澳各国的代表，现在才能够在这里集会，在亚澳工会的历史上创造一个新纪元。
    我代表越南代表团向中国的工人阶级和他们英明的领袖们致谢，由于他们热心努力、组织了这一划时代的亚澳工会会议。这个会议在不久以前才开过伟大的中国人民政治协商会议的大厅中举行，在这个会场中还震荡着中国人民对于新的人民共和国的欢呼的声浪。
    这里我要根据我们代表团的意见，报告一些事实。这些事实，赛扬同志已经提到了，我对于赛扬同志的意见是完全同意的。
    是的，同志们，这一次会议是国际工人阶级的普遍胜利，特别是亚澳两洲的工人阶级的胜利，因为它给金元和英镑的主人以当头痛击。
    自从一九四五年巴黎世界工联大会刚有组织这一会议的意思的时候，英镑和金镑的主人就想进行破坏。因为他们怕亚洲工人联合起来，力量壮大了。
    因此，在世界工联中有很高的位置的帝国主义的代理人，就反对世界工联的工作计划中召开亚洲会议的这一条。美国的工会当时是负责推举代表担任殖民地方面的工作的。但三年以来，他们派出的三位干事中，有两个始终没有就职（这两个人是勃洛费和吉尔美），还有一位叫做哥甫的，简直是一点生气没有，最后是毫不知就离开了他的职位。
    还有狄金、陶逊、加莱等帝国主义的忠实奴才，他们离开世界工联，其目的就是希望破坏国际工会。但他们的退出，不但没有削减世界工联的力量，而且只有由于扫除了工人阶级中叛徒们的障碍，才更便利了世界工联的前进。
    为了同一的目的，这些美国产业职工大会、劳工联合会和英国职工大会的头子想尽方法组织所谓“亚洲劳工联盟”，依靠武装的工会的力量而把这种组织放在该国新法西斯政府的掌握中。
    他们曾想在印度的拉阿瑞召开会议，但没有实现，另外一次想在一九四九年的六月在瑞士日内瓦举行，又遭到了可怜的失败。现在，帝国主义政府在各国的代理人，如日本的麦克阿瑟，印尼的哈达，他们仍然存在着一种破坏的目的，禁止各该国的代表来参加会议。但这仍然不能阻止劳动大众有他们的代表在这里，同时他更不能阻止真理，因为它并不需要护照就可以越出国界。
    反动派反对这一会议所根据的理由，无疑地是和过去他们的代表还参加世界工联时完全一样的。他们说亚洲的职工会议不是真正的职工会议，说亚澳会议只是一个政治性的会议。只有那些把工会贩卖给帝国主义金圆大王的人，只有工人阶级的叛徒，只有战争的挑拨者，只有拥护剥削工人阶级的人所组织的工会，才不是真正的工会！叛徒们，你们要知道，我们之所以具有会议的政治性，是因为我们要保卫我们全体人民的劳动的果实以及我们国家全体人民的财富。我们是要有政治性的，世界上没有任何一个工会组织不把它的经常的保护工人权利的斗争，和全体人民为和平为民族的独立的广泛斗争联系在一起的。没有一种力量可以阻止亚澳十亿五千万人民的团结和为他们的权利、自由与幸福而结合的共同战线。亲爱的同志们，这会议是宣布分裂分子的死刑，同时也就是申明工人阶级有不可侵犯的权利。为了获得这些成功，一切工会组织都应当作艰苦的斗争，虽然我们不应当过高地估计帝国主义者的力量，但也不应当过低的估计它。在亚洲，由于中国人民和中国工人阶级获得的决定性的胜利，我们可以说是给帝国主义者当头的致命的一击。但还有若干点值得注意，特别是在东南亚各国，帝国主义者还计划加强他们的军事根据地，他们的力量还很强大，对他们决定性的胜利的道路，就是中国四亿七千五百万人走过的道路。
    伦敦会议和巴黎代表大会的决议案，明确地规定了关于殖民地和附庸国的主要任务，而这决议案，是米兰二次世界工联大会一再强调地指出了的。现在，世界工联对于这一任务的完成，首先是要避免工人阶级叛徒们的破坏。所以这一次的会议必须首先成立一个联络局，并且依照世界工联的决议案，和亚澳工会运动的具体情况，定出一个行动计划来。除了亚洲的苏维埃共和国外，大部分国家的工人运动，都是要和民族独立斗争运动、民主斗争运动、反封建和反帝国主义压迫的斗争运动联在一起的。这斗争，在中国是已获得了胜利，在南朝鲜、日本、菲律宾、马来亚、缅甸、印尼、越南……虽然在困难的条件之下，但也正在继续进行。有许多地方，资产阶级的领袖还巧妙地利用这一斗争，但他们的愿望一旦达到了以后，他们就变成了帝国主义者的忠实奴才而反对人民了。还有，他们以比帝国主义的公开统治还要更恶劣凶横的压迫，在印度、印尼、缅甸、菲律宾，打击工人阶级。政府的御用工会在英美背叛工人的工会领导下，在工人的行列中，导演了一种分裂分子的行动。这一会议的任务，应当是揭发现在当权的领袖们的假民主，告发他们服从帝国主义，宣布他们的反工人、反工会的压迫手段，并请求世界工联强迫联合国接受各国工会对于自由的要求。
    这一会议的任务，明白地告诉亚洲各国工人，他们和他们的人民解放的道路，必须和中国工人一样，即直接地参加人民解放战争才可以成功的。
    同时，会议也必须强调为和平而斗争的运动，在亚洲民族解放的意义上，是非常重要。我们必须知道世界和平力量所获得的每一胜利，无论是苏联或人民民主国家生产的每一部拖拉机，无论是中国解放战争的每一方公里土地的解放，无论是英美法意各国工人所要求的事得到了一点满足……这都是给帝国主义头上的一大打击，对于被压迫人民的解放都有所贡献。
    关于准备在中国建立的世界工联常设联络局的问题，这一个常设联络局任务是随时检查亚澳工人们的斗争、工作和生活情况；以便必要时把世界工人的精神和物质的支援力量拿来帮助他们。常设联络局的工人，还要保证亚洲各国的工会同世界工联有经常的密切的联系，以便它们能够互相交换经验，以及团结各国工人运动成为一体。在这一目的之下，我们认为常设联络局经常来作收集材料以及宣传工作，并对亚洲各国工会的出版事务加以指导，这也是必要的。它可以派出小组委员会到亚洲各国去作调查研究的工作。在这些工作中，我们认为中华全国总工会占有一个重要的位置，所以我们提议常设联络局要设在北京。
    亚洲澳洲工会会议万岁！
    世界工会联合会万岁！
    国际工人团结万岁！
