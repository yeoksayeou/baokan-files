　　The Treasure of the People's Motherland - The Southern Jiangxi Tungsten Mining Area
    Guo Yi
  　I. To Xihuashan, the World's Largest Tungsten Mining Area
    A red, rocky road stretches from the edge of Dayu City in southern Jiangxi Province, towards the continuous Dayuling mountain range west of the city. The end of the road is the world-famous tungsten mining area - Xihuashan. The Xihuashan Engineering Office of the Jiangxi Tungsten and Tin Mining Company has mines on the mountain, engaged in the mining and acquisition of tungsten-manganese-iron ore. This fifteen-li-long road was built by the company to transport the ore from the mountain.
    On August 16th, my Guangdong-Jiangxi-Hunan Border Column, which had persisted in the anti-Japanese guerrilla warfare in the Guangdong-Jiangxi-Hunan border area, liberated Dayu County. On the 28th, Xihuashan was also liberated. From that day on, the world's largest Xihuashan tungsten mining area was recovered by the people themselves for the first time and quickly resumed production.
    There are many pedestrians on the road to Xihuashan, most of whom are miners from the mountain. They sell their tungsten ore in Dayu City, buy back loads of white rice, and walk in groups of three or five towards the mountains. A young miner named Liu Huanxiang was laboriously carrying a load of white rice, with a hen tied on top of the load, which looked like it was newly bought. We chatted on the road. He introduced the situation of this road to me: "When the Kuomintang's 70th Army was here, no one dared to walk on the road at all. If they met you, they would either drag you into the army or make you a porter. The day you arrived in Dayu, the road became lively the next day."
    The strong sunlight shone on Xihuashan. Looking from the road, in the middle of a lush mountain range, the top and belly of Xihuashan seemed to have been peeled off, exposing glittering quartz stone and light red soil. Liu Huanxiang pointed there and said: "That is where the tungsten ore is produced."
    II. The Treasure of the People's Motherland
    Xihuashan is composed of igneous rocks. Quartz veins permeate the igneous rocks, running east-west, with a dip of over eighty degrees, and a width ranging from one centimeter to three or four meters. Tungsten ore is scattered within the quartz veins. On the surface of the veins, the tungsten content accounts for one percent, and at the bottom of the veins - below one hundred meters, the tungsten content accounts for four and a half percent. According to estimates by the Jiangxi Tungsten and Tin Mining Company, the tungsten ore reserves of Xihuashan are about 350,000 tons, which is the richest among the tungsten mining areas discovered in the world.
    The tungsten ore produced in Xihuashan is mainly tungsten-manganese-iron ore, with a small amount of calcium tungstate. The pseudo-"Central Geological Survey" analyzed the composition of the tungsten-manganese-iron ore produced in Xihuashan as: tungsten trioxide 72.30 percent, manganese oxide 12.07 percent, iron oxide 11.02 percent, and silicon dioxide 4.52 percent.
    Tungsten has a melting point above 3000 degrees Celsius and can be used to refine an alloy called tungsten steel. This alloy is an indispensable and extremely important national defense resource for manufacturing guns, cannons, and airplanes.
    In terms of the distribution of tungsten ore in China, it is distributed in eight provinces including Jiangxi, Guangdong, Hunan, Hebei, Guangxi, Yunnan, Fujian, and Xinjiang, with Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Hunan having the most, and Jiangxi ranking first. Among the seventeen counties in southern Jiangxi, there is no county that does not produce tungsten ore. This shows the abundance of tungsten ore reserves in Jiangxi.
    As for how much tungsten ore is buried in Jiangxi, there is no accurate statistic yet. According to a survey material published in Volume 1, Issue 2 of the pseudo-Resources Commission Quarterly, the tungsten ore reserves in Jiangxi Province are 1.6 million metric tons, with Dayu County having the most, reaching more than 500,000 metric tons, followed by Anyuan, Longnan, Qiannan, and Chongyi counties. In terms of mines, Xihuashan, Pangushan, and Kuimeishan have the most, all above 200,000 metric tons.
    According to the current mining situation, the average annual output of tungsten in Jiangxi Province is over 10,000 metric tons, accounting for 70 percent of the national output, and China's output accounts for 70 percent of the world's total output. There is no doubt that this is an extremely valuable resource for the future construction of the national defense cause of the People's China. Jiangxi, especially the tungsten mining area of southern Jiangxi, is a rich treasure house of the people's motherland.
    III. The History of Plunder
    Jiangxi's tungsten mining industry began in the early years of the Republic of China when farmers around Xihuashan went up the mountain to pick tungsten ore. From then until now, it has been more than thirty years. These thirty years, like other major industrial and mining industries in China, are a history of plunder by imperialists and Chinese bureaucrats, warlords, and compradors.
    Xihuashan was originally a scenic spot in Dayu County, with the Xihua Temple built in the Song Dynasty on the mountain. It is said that at that time, the mountains were beautiful with forests and valleys, and the scenery was pleasant, with tourists all year round. In the early years of the Republic of China, a German missionary named Wu Lixiang came to Xihuashan to visit and found that the mountains and valleys were full of small black stones. He felt very strange, so he picked a few pieces and sent them back to Germany for testing. As a result, it was confirmed that the small black stones were tungsten-manganese-iron ore. Wu Lixiang spent five hundred silver dollars to buy the mountain from the host of Xihua Temple, named Miaoyuan, and began to hire farmers from the foot of the mountain to pick tungsten ore and transport it back to Germany to manufacture munitions. Later, this matter was discovered by the locals. After many negotiations, it was repurchased at a price higher than that of Wu Lixiang. In this way, Xihuashan, starting from being plundered by imperialism, was transformed from a scenic spot into a world-famous mine. When the tungsten ore on the surface was picked clean, the lush forests and bamboos on the mountain were also cut down piece by piece, and the verdant mountains gradually exposed white quartz stone.
    In 1914, the First World War broke out, and the rapidly developing arms industry of the belligerent countries opened up a vast market for tungsten ore. The price of tungsten immediately increased several times. At this time, farmers from as far away as Hunan came to Xihuashan to mine, and the number of workers increased to thirty to forty thousand. There are still many old workers left over from that time on the mountain, who will tell you about the prosperity of Xihuashan at that time.
    In the twenty years from the time Xihuashan was recovered from foreigners to 1936, it went through various operating methods such as commercial operation, government operation, government supervision and commercial operation, and provincial operation, until March 1, 1936, when it was nationalized by the pseudo-Resources Commission. During this period, the Kuomintang bureaucrats and warlords made a great fortune by means of this tungsten mine. In 1928 alone, they collected 220,000 silver dollars in tungsten ore tax in the name of "construction funds." In 1933, when the pseudo-Jiangxi Provincial Government signed a five-year agency contract with Jianxing Company, it collected 1.75 million silver dollars in tungsten ore tax. They seized the mine from the people and collected a large amount of taxes from the people.
    In 1945, when the Japanese invaders surrendered, the Kuomintang government restored the Jiangxi Tungsten and Tin Mining Company. The company was located in Gan County, and below it were five engineering offices, namely Xihuashan (Dayu), Kuimeishan (Qiannan), Dajishan (Longnan), Huameiao (Ningdu), and Jinhuashan (Ningdu), and three offices in Ji'an, Shangyou, and Yudu. There was a directly affiliated mine in Gan County, with a sand collection office below it; in Guangzhou, there was an office specializing in selling sand.
    Jiangxi's tungsten mining industry was jointly run by the pseudo-Resources Commission and the pseudo-Jiangxi Provincial Government, with only 3.5 million pseudo-gold yuan as a fund for acquiring tungsten ore, to deceive the miners for the tungsten ore they exchanged with their blood and sweat. The only way they made up for the lack of funds was to ruthlessly suppress the price of sand. In February and March of this year, when the pseudo-gold yuan depreciated sharply, the price of sand and the price of rice became the same. Miners could only mine up to two catties of tungsten ore per day, so they could only exchange it for two catties of rice. Sometimes, if they couldn't mine sand, they couldn't even drink porridge. Hunger forced the miners to painfully put down their hammers and steel bars that they had used for many years, and leave the familiar Xihuashan to seek a living elsewhere. With the sharp reduction in the number of workers, the production situation fell month by month. According to the statistics of the Xihuashan Engineering Office of Jiangxi Tungsten and Tin Mining Company, there were 2,773 miners engaged in free mining in Xihuashan mine in January of this year, but only more than 400 were left before the liberation in August of this year. Another statistic: more than 120 tons of tungsten ore were acquired in Xihuashan in January of this year, but only two tons were acquired in August.
    For more than thirty years, miners have mined a large amount of tungsten ore from Xihuashan, Kuimeishan, Dajishan... Among them, except for a very small part, which was transported to Germany in the early stage, almost all of the rest was exported to the United States through the hands of bureaucrats, warlords, and compradors from Guangzhou and Hong Kong. According to an extremely inaccurate statistic: from 1918 to 1948, Jiangxi produced a total of 242,604 metric tons of tungsten ore (missing the output of 1945 and 1947, see "Special Products of Jiangxi" published by Nanchang Credit Inquiry Office), most of which were transported to the United States. Based on the export price of tungsten ore last year of 1,150 US dollars per metric ton, it was worth a total of 278,994,600 US dollars.
    However, the miners of Xihuashan, even those old workers who had worked on the mountain for thirty years, still had nothing but hammers and steel bars; they were still threatened by hunger at any time.
    This is the historical outline of Jiangxi's tungsten mining industry.
    IV. The "Sand Diggers"
    The miners call themselves "sand diggers." For more than thirty years, the most number of miners in Xihuashan has been three to forty thousand. In such a long period of time, how did they live? When you ask them, almost everyone's answer is the same: "Digging sand is so hard - oh!" The heavy southern Jiangxi accent stretches the word "hard" very long and very heavy. The living conditions of the miners are rarely seen in the plains and in the countryside, especially in the south of the Yangtze River.
    The miners in Xihuashan are divided into two types: "inside workers" and "outside workers." "Inside workers" are further divided into technical workers and ordinary workers. They work in the Xihuashan mine of the Xihuashan Engineering Office of the Jiangxi Tungsten and Tin Mining Company. There are not many "inside workers." The statistics in January of this year showed that there were 557 people, roughly equivalent to a quarter of the number of "outside workers." Compared with "outside workers," the lives of "inside workers" are more stable, but they are also very hard. In name, they work eight hours a day, but in reality, they often work more than ten hours, and they dare not speak casually. As for the living conditions of "outside workers," they are much harder than "inside workers."
    Among those who come to the mountain to work as "outside workers" (miners engaged in free mining), Hunan people are the most, sometimes accounting for two-thirds of the total number of "outside workers." The second is the Nankang people and Dayu people in southern Jiangxi. Most of them are farmers, some of whom have lost their land in the countryside and come to the mountain to make a living, and some who have come to the mountain to avoid military service (the Kuomintang government stipulates that miners do not have to join the army, but sometimes they will be caught if they go down the mountain). There are also those who come to the mountain as a sideline during the slack farming season.
    When "outside workers" first come to the mountain, few of them engage in mining alone, because "digging sand" requires a complete set of tools: hammers, steel bars, tungsten nitrate (explosives), oil lamps, etc.; in addition, they must prepare food, which requires a batch of capital. More importantly, when they first arrive on the mountain, they do not understand how to "dig sand." In the absence of both capital and technology, some join "sheds" and work with others, while others ask people to introduce them to "bosses" to work as hired laborers. "Shed heads" (the leaders in the sheds) and "bosses" are the exploiting classes on the mountain. "Shed heads" manage food in the "sheds" and are responsible for selling sand and buying furniture, exploiting other miners in the same shed. "Shed heads" are mostly miners themselves and generally do not have much capital. Sometimes they have to borrow from "bosses." "Bosses" are the capitalists on the mountain, usually appearing as merchants, relying on lending to exploit "shed heads" and workers. Some miners owe the "bosses" six or seven thousand catties of tungsten ore in less than two or three years, and can never pay it off. In the heyday of Xihuashan, there were as many as sixty or seventy "bosses." The most powerful "boss" was the township chief on the mountain. Liu Kongren, the township chief of Xihuashan, was a "boss" who made a fortune by lending. When the miners could not repay the huge debts, the "bosses" did not hesitate to confiscate the "holes" (mine pits) of the debtors and deprive them of their livelihoods.
    Usually, a miner can mine about two catties of tungsten ore a day on average, and sometimes they may not be able to mine any at all. After the meager income is subjected to heavy exploitation by "shed heads," "bosses," bureaucrats, warlords, and compradors... when it reaches the "sand diggers," at most they can only eat three meals of dry rice a day.
    The "sand diggers" are also subjected to heavy tax extortion and the threat of conscription. Before liberation, they had not dared to go down the mountain for a long time.
    The area of the Xihuashan mining area is 3.5 square kilometers, divided into four management areas. The "sand diggers" live scattered near their own "holes." The so-called houses are nothing more than thatched huts that cannot even block the wind and rain, and they have to pay the "bosses" five sheng of rice per month as rent. All year round, except for the old lunar New Year, even on rainy days, they have to wear bamboo hats in their thatched huts and work for more than ten hours, breaking the quartz stone with hammers, one hammer at a time, to extract tungsten-manganese-iron ore from it.
    However, despite the brutality of the rulers of Xihuashan - the township chiefs and "bosses," the "sand diggers" have not given up their struggle to fight for survival. Around Xihuashan, the people's own armed forces in the Guangdong-Jiangxi-Hunan border area - the Southern Jiangxi Detachment, persisted in the cruel revolutionary struggle behind enemy lines, encouraging the fighting spirit of the "sand diggers." Old miners Long Hengsheng and Liu Shude praised this team to reporters, saying, "The guerrillas are the most civilized team." They deeply knew that this team and the Red Army led by Commander-in-Chief Zhu that had passed through here several times since 1927 were the same "most civilized army." They firmly believed that the Red Army would sooner or later fight up the mountain.
    They placed their only hope here and also gained the confidence to fight from here. In March of this year, when Chiang Kai-shek's "gold yuan coupons" plummeted and the price of sand and rice were almost equal, when a large number of miners went down the mountain, the old miners launched a demonstration petition to fight for higher sand prices, and as a result, their struggle was victorious.
    When the young miners could no longer endure, they resolutely dropped their hammers and went down the mountain to join their own armed forces - the guerrilla forces persisting in the revolutionary struggle in the mountains, and took up guns to participate in the anti-Japanese war. Comrade Kang Xinyu of the Southern Jiangxi Detachment, whom the reporter met, was one of them.
    In this way, the "sand diggers" spent their long and difficult years day by day.
    V. The Dawn of Xihuashan
    On August 28th, the People's Liberation Army liberated Xihuashan. Since then, Xihuashan has ended its history of being plundered, and the miners have begun to work on their own Xihuashan as masters.
    With the complete liberation of southern Jiangxi, the Jiangxi Provincial People's Government completely took over the Jiangxi Tungsten and Tin Mining Company and all units such as the Xihuashan Engineering Office. While mobilizing employees to take inventory, the takeover authorities began to restore production. First, starting in mid-September, they resumed the sand collection work that had been suspended since the Kuomintang period. The company purchased the tungsten ore mined by the miners at a fair price, and at the same time announced the policy that in order to protect national defense resources, tungsten ore should be purchased uniformly by the state-owned enterprise - the Military Control Jiangxi Tungsten and Tin Mining Company, and should not be sold or smuggled. In addition, the takeover authorities are actively recalling the miners who have already gone down the mountain, and are preparing to continue to expand production and open large-scale miners' cooperatives to guarantee the lives of the miners and liberate them from the exploitation of "shed heads" and "bosses."
    There are still more than 20 "inside workers" working in the mine, clearing the tungsten ore in the tunnels and preparing to continue mining. Their lives have been initially improved. As an organization of the workers themselves, the Study Committee has been organized on September 23rd. The Study Committee will lead the miners in work, study, and entertainment in order to further organize them to improve their awareness.
    After liberation, prices in Dayu are falling day by day, and the "outside workers" continue to mine tungsten ore. Every day, on the road from Xihuashan to Dayu, they carry tungsten ore to Dayu and carry back white rice. They are no longer afraid of being conscripted.
    The Xihuashan mine has been developed for more than thirty years since its opening. For such a long time, this is the first time such a new atmosphere has appeared. When you walk past each low thatched hut, the miners will take the lead with sincere smiles to greet you and tell you how they have spent more than thirty years, climbing up from the abyss of hunger and humiliation to greet this bright and brilliant dawn.

　　人民祖国的宝藏——赣南钨矿区
    郭奕
  　一、到世界最大的钨矿区——西华山去
    一条红色多石的公路，经江西省南部大庾城边，向着绵亘城西的大庾岭山丛中伸展开去，路的尽头，便是举世闻名的钨矿区——西华山。江西钨锡矿业有限公司的西华山工程处，在山上设有矿场，从事钨锰铁矿的开采与收购。这条十五华里长的公路，便是该公司为了运输山上的矿砂修筑起来的。
    八月十六日，坚持粤赣湘边区敌后游击战争的我粤赣湘边纵队解放了大庾县城，到二十八日，西华山也获得了解放。从这天起，世界最大的西华山钨矿区，第一次被人民自己收回，并很快地就恢复了生产。
    通往西华山的公路上，行人很多，大部都是山上的矿工。他们在大庾城里，卖掉自己的钨砂，买回一担担的白米，三五成群地向山间走去。青年矿工刘焕祥，吃力地担着一担白米，担上面还拴着一支母鸡，看情形，是新买来的。路上，我们攀谈起来。他向我介绍这条公路的情形：“国民党七十军在这里的时候，简直没人敢在路上走。遇上，不是拉去当兵，就是当挑夫。你们第一天到了大庾，第二天路上就热闹起来了。”
    强烈的阳光，照射着西华山，从公路上望去，一片苍翠的山丛中间，西华山的山巅和山腹象被剥去了一层皮一样，裸露着闪闪发光的石英石和淡红色的土壤。刘焕祥用手指着那里说：“那就是出产钨砂的所在”。
    二、人民祖国的宝藏
    西华山是由火成岩构成的。石英脉渗透在火成岩当中，脉向东西走，倾斜度在八十度以上，宽度从一公寸到三四公尺不等，钨矿就散布在石英脉里面。脉的表层，钨的成份占百分之一，脉的底层——一百公尺以下，钨的成份占百分之四点五。据江西钨锡矿业有限公司估计，西华山的钨矿埋藏量约为三十五万吨，在世界上已经发现的钨矿区里面，西华山的埋藏量要算最丰富的了。
    西华山产的钨矿，主要是钨锰铁矿，另有一少部分钨酸钙矿。伪“中央地质调查所”分析西华山产的钨锰铁矿的成份为：三氧化钨百分之七二·三○，氧化锰百分之一二·○七，氧化铁百分之一一·○二，二氧化矽百分之四·五二。
    钨的溶度在摄氏三千度以上，可以用来炼成一种名叫钨钢的合金。这种合金，是制造枪炮、飞机时不可或缺的一项极为重要的国防资源。
    就整个中国钨矿的分布情形来说，它分布在江西、广东、湖南、河北、广西、云南、福建、新疆等八个省份，其中以江西、广东和湖南三省为最多，而江西又居第一；江西南部十七县当中，没有一县不产钨矿。由此可见江西钨矿埋藏量的丰富。
    至于江西到底埋藏了多少钨矿，现在还没有一个详确的统计。据伪资源委员会季刊一卷二期刊载的一个调查材料披露，江西全省钨矿的埋藏量为一百六十万公吨，以大庾县为最多，达五十多万公吨，其次是安远、龙南、虔南、崇义等县。就矿山来说，以西华山、盘古山和岿美山为最多，都在二十万公吨以上。
    根据现在开采的情形看，江西全省每年产钨都平均在一万公吨以上，占全国产量的百分之七十，而中国的产量又占全世界总产量的百分之七十。毫无疑问，这对于将来建设人民中国的国防事业来说，是一项极为珍贵的资源。江西，特别是赣南的钨矿区是人民祖国的一个丰富的宝库。
    三、被掠夺的历史
    江西的钨矿业是从民国初年西华山四周的农民上山拣钨砂时候开始的。从那时到现在，已经有三十多年的历史。这三十多年，和中国的其它大工矿业相似，是一部被帝国主义者和中国的官僚、军阀、买办们掠夺的历史。
    西华山，原来是大庾县的一个名胜，山上有宋代建筑的西华庵。据说，那时，山上林壑幽美，景物宜人，一年四季都是游人不绝的。民国初年，德国借传教士邬里享来西华山游览，发现满山满谷尽是黑色的小石块，他觉得很奇怪，于是，便随地拣了几块寄回德国去化验，结果，证实了那黑色小石块便是钨锰铁矿。邬里享化了五百个白洋从西华庵主持人叫做妙圆的那里买到了这座山，开始雇用山下的农民到山上拣钨矿石，运回德国去制造军火。后来，这件事情被本地人发觉了，经过多次折冲，才用倍于邬里享的价格，重新收回。这样，西华山从被帝国主义掠夺开始，便由一个风景区变成了举世闻名的矿场，等到地表面的钨矿石被人们拣净以后，那山上的茂林修竹也一片片地被人砍伐下来，苍翠的山岭，渐渐地裸露出白莹莹的石英石。
    一九一四年，第一次世界大战揭幕了，急剧发达起来的交战国的军火工业，给钨矿开辟了广大的市场。钨价立即提高数倍，这时，远至湖南的农民，都到西华山来采矿，工人增加到三四万。现在，山上仍然很多从那时留下来的老工人，他会告诉你那时候西华山的繁盛景象。
    西华山从外人手里收回来到民国二十五年的二十多年间，先后经过了商营，官办，官督商办，省营等各种经营方式，直到民国二十五年三月一日，才经伪资源委员会收归“国”有。其间，国民党的官僚、军阀们借着这个钨矿，大大地发了财。仅民国十七年一年，他们就以做为“建设基金”的名义收了钨矿税白洋二十二万元。民国二十二年，伪江西省政府在和建兴公司订立五年代营合同时，又征收了钨矿税白洋一百七十五万元。他们从人民手里夺取了矿山，又从人民手里收去大量的捐税。
    民国三十四年日寇投降，国民党政府恢复了江西钨锡矿业有限公司。该公司设在赣县，下面分设西华山（大庾）、岿美山（虔南）、大吉山（龙南）、画眉坳（宁都）、金华山（宁都）等五个工程处，和吉安、上犹、雩都三个办事处。在赣县设有直属矿场，下设收砂处；在广州，有办事处，专门从事卖砂。
    江西的钨矿事业是由伪资源委员会和伪江西省政府两合办的，资金只有伪金圆券三百五十万元，做为收购钨矿的基金，来骗取矿工们以血汗换来的钨矿。他们弥补资金缺乏的唯一办法，是无情地压低砂价，今年春季二三月间，伪金圆券急剧贬值的时候，砂价和米价变成了同样价格的东西，矿工们一个人每天最多只能采到两斤钨砂，结果就只能换得两斤米。有时，采不到砂子就连稀饭也喝不上了。饥饿迫使着矿工们不得不忍痛放下自己用了多少年的铁锤，钢条，离开熟悉的西华山，另到别处去谋生。随着工人人数的锐减，生产情形便逐月跌落下来。据江西钨锡矿业有限公司西华山工程处统计，今年一月在西华山矿场从事自由开采的矿工有两千七百七十三人，但到今年八月解放之前，只胜下了四百多人。另一个统计：今年一月在西华山收购的钨矿有一百二十多吨，到八月只收了两吨。
    三十多年来，矿工们从西华山，从岿美山，从大吉山……开采出来了大量的钨矿，其中，除掉极少一部分，在初期运去德国外，其余几乎是全部地，经过官僚、军阀、买办们的手，从广州、香港出口，运往美国去了。据一个极不精确的统计：从民国七年到三十七年三十年间，江西共出产了钨矿二十四万二千六百零四公吨（缺三十四、三十六两年产量，见南昌征信所出版“江西之特产”），绝大部分都被运到美国。以去年的钨砂出口价格每公吨一千一百五十元美金计算，共值美金两亿七千八百九十九万四千六百元。
    但是，西华山的矿工，即使是那些在山上干了三十年的老工人，依旧除掉铁锤、钢条之外一无所有；依旧是随时受着饥饿的威胁。
    这便是江西钨矿事业的历史轮廓。
    四、“打沙子的人”们
    矿工们把自己叫做“打沙子的人”。三十多年来，西华山的矿工最多时候到过三、四万人，在这样悠长的岁月里，他们是怎样生活着的呢？当你问起他们的时候，几乎每个人的回答都是一样的：“打沙子的，好苦——噢！”浓重的赣南土音，把“苦”字拉得很长，而且很沉重。矿工们的生活情形，在平原、在农村是很少见的，尤其江南。
    西华山的矿工，分做“里工”和“外工”两种，“里工”又分做技术工和普通工，他们是在江西钨锡矿业有限公司西华山工程处的西华山矿场里面做工的。“里工”人数不多，今年一月时候的统计有五百五十七个人，大致相当于“外工”人数的四分之一，比起“外工”来，“里工”的生活要稳定一些，但也很苦。名义上每天做八个钟点的工，实际上往往要超过十小时，而且不敢随便讲话。至于“外工”的生活情形，比“里工”就更苦得多了。
    来到山上做“外工”的（从事自由开采的矿工），以湖南人为最多，有时要占全体“外工”人数的三分之二。其次是赣南的南康人，大庾人。他们大部分都是农民，有的是在农村失去土地后来到山上谋生的，有的是为了逃避兵役来到山上躲避的（国民党政府规定矿工可以不去当兵，但有时下山会被抓走）。也有的是趁着农闲时期做为一种副业来到山上的。
    “外工”，刚刚来到山上的时候，很少有自己单独从事开采的，因为“打沙子”要有一整套家具：铁锤、钢条、钨硝（炸药）、油灯等；另外还要准备粮食，这些需要一批本钱。更要紧的是初到山上，不懂得“沙子”的打法。在既无资本，又无技术的情况下，有的加入“棚子”与人合伙，有的便请人介绍到“老板”那里去当雇工。“棚头”（棚子里的头目）和“老板”是山上的剥削阶级，“棚头”在“棚子”里管伙食，负责卖砂子，买家具，从中剥削同棚的其它矿工。“棚头”多半是矿工出身，一般地没有多大本钱，有时候要向“老板”去借贷。“老板”则是山上的资产者，通常以商人面貌出现，靠放债盘剥“棚头”和工人。有的矿工不到两三年功夫，就欠下“老板”六七千斤钨砂，永远归还不清。西华山的极盛时代，“老板”多到六七十家，最有实力的“老板”便是山上的乡保长，西华山的乡长刘孔仁，就是一个靠放债发家的“老板”。当矿工们归还不起巨量的债务时，“老板”们便不惜把债户的“口子”（矿坑）没收，夺掉对方的饭碗。
    通常一个矿工，平均一天能采到两斤左右钨砂，有时也许一点都采不到。这点少许的收入经过“棚头”、“老板”、官僚、军阀、买办……重重剥削之后，到“打沙子的人”那里的时候，顶多也不过每天能吃上三餐干饭而已。
    “打沙子的人”们，又受着繁重的捐税勒索与拉兵的威胁，在解放以前，他们已有好久不敢下山去了。
    西华山矿区的面积，有三·五平方公里大，共分做四个管理区，“打沙子的人”们散住在自己的“口子”附近。所谓房屋，只不过是一间连风雨都遮蔽不住的茅棚，而且要给“老板”们每个月纳五升米的租债，一年四季，除掉旧历的年节之外，即使是下雨天，他们也要戴上斗笠在自己的茅棚里，做上十小时以上的工作，用铁锤一锤一锤地打碎石英石，从里面取出钨锰铁矿。
    但，尽管西华山的统治者们——乡保长、“老板”们，那样残暴，“打沙子的人”们并没有放弃过自己为了争取生存的斗争。在西华山的周围，粤赣湘边区人民自己的武装——赣南支队，坚持着敌后残酷的革命斗争，鼓舞了“打沙子的人”们的斗争勇气。老矿工龙恒生、刘树德对记者称赞这支队伍说：“游击队是顶文明的队伍”，他们深深知道这支队伍和民国十六年以后，前后数度从这里经过，由朱总司令带头的红军是一样的“顶文明的军队”，他们深信迟早红军是会打上山来的。
    他们把唯一的希望寄托在这里，也从这里取得了斗争信心。今年三月间，当蒋匪“金圆券”猛跌，砂价米价几乎平衡，矿工们大量下山的时候，老矿工们就发动过一次为了争取提高砂价的示威性的请愿，结果，他们的斗争胜利了。
    年青的矿工们，当再不能继续忍耐下去的时候，便毅然地丢下铁锤走下山去，加入自己的武装——在山地坚持革命斗争的游击部队，拿起枪来参加了敌后的解放战争。记者遇到的赣南支队的康昕彧同志，就?钦庋?囊桓觥?
    就这样，“打沙子的人”们，一天一天地渡过了悠长苦难的岁月。
    五、西华山的黎明
    八月二十八日，人民解放军解放了西华山。从此，西华山结束了它被掠夺的历史，矿工们开始以主人翁的姿态在自己的西华山上工作着。
    随着赣南的全部解放，江西省人民政府完整地接管了江西钨锡矿业有限公司和西华山工程处等所有单位。接管当局一边发动职工进行清点，一边着手恢复生产。首先从九月中旬开始恢复了从国民党时期即已停顿下来的收砂工作，公司以公正的价格收买矿工们开采出来的钨砂，同时宣布了为着保护国防资源，钨砂由国家企业机关——军管江西钨锡矿业有限公司统一收买，不得外卖及走私的方针。此外，接管方面正在积极往回召集已经下山的矿工，并准备继续扩大生产，开办大规模的矿工合作社，来保证矿工们的生活，从“棚头”、“老板”的剥削之下把他们解放出来。
    在矿场工作的“里工”现在还有二十多人，正在清理坑道钨砂，准备继续开采。他们的生活，已经有了初步的改善，做为工人自己的组织，学习委员会已经在九月二十三日组织起来。学习委员会将领导矿工们进行工作、学习和娱乐，以便进一步组织他们来提高他们的觉悟。
    解放后，大庾的物价逐日下跌着，“外工”们继续挖掘着钨砂。每天，从西华山到大庾去的公路上，他们担去钨砂，担回白米，他们再不怕有人拉丁了。
    西华山矿场，从开辟到现在三十多年了，这么长的年月里，还是第一次出现这样的新气象，当你走过每一间低矮的茅棚前面时，矿工们都会带头满脸诚挚的笑意来迎接你，并告诉你他们怎样过了三十多年，从那个饥饿与屈辱的深渊里爬上来，迎接这光辉灿烂的黎明。
