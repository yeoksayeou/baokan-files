Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, November 11th: The first Shanghai Student Congress grandly opened on the 10th. There were 439 student representatives, representing 118,000 students from 341 universities, colleges, and middle schools in Shanghai. Shanghai Municipal People's Government Mayor Chen Yi, Deputy Mayor Zeng Shan, Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party Rao Shushi, Deputy Secretary Liu Xiao, Director of the Municipal Education Bureau Dai Baitao, Director of Higher Education Tang Shouyu, famous university professors Chen Wangdao, Liu Fonian, Cao Weifeng, Xia Jianbai, Zhou Gucheng, representatives from the education association Shen Tilan, and representatives from youth federations and student federations along the Nanjing-Shanghai line, totaling more than 60 guests, attended the meeting. Rao Shushi was invited to speak at the meeting, pointing out that Shanghai students and Chinese students have a glorious revolutionary tradition and have always stood at the forefront of the struggle with the working class and the peasantry. The future task of the student movement is to strengthen the unity of students throughout the city, strengthen learning, and become useful talents for building a new China. The congress then presented flags to the Shanghai Municipal People's Government, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and the Songhu Garrison Command. Following this, Li Chang, Secretary of the East China Working Committee of the New Democratic Youth League, spoke, pointing out that acquiring the skills to build a new China is an urgent requirement of the majority of students and should be the focus of discussion and resolution at this congress. At the meeting, Chen Zhenzhong, representative of the All-China Student Federation, presented a new-style mimeograph machine from the International Student Union to the congress, which was met with enthusiastic applause from the audience. The congress also passed a letter to the International Student Union, expressing heartfelt thanks. The congress will last for four days (from the 10th to the 13th), and the main agenda is to discuss the work report of the Shanghai Student Federation over the past five months and the current tasks of the Shanghai student movement, and to adopt the Shanghai Student Federation's constitution. During the congress, the Municipal Student Federation also held an exhibition of student movement materials on the third floor of the Great World Department Store, including photos, wall newspapers, the past secret organ of the Student Federation, the student newspaper, stacks of blacklists from the Kuomintang bandit secret service, the Central Statistics Bureau, the pseudo-police bureau, the pseudo-garrison headquarters, such as the "suspected communist student list," the criminal records of patriotic students in the special criminal court, the struggle records of Shanghai students since the "December 9th Movement," and the work records of Shanghai students in protecting schools, organizing people's propaganda teams, opposing silver dollar speculation, searching for bandits and secret agents, supporting the army, and disaster relief before and after liberation. On the same day, major Shanghai newspapers published special issues on the student congress and published editorials to celebrate the opening of the congress.
    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, November 13th: At the first Shanghai Student Congress, the executive committee of the Shanghai Student Federation reported on the work of the student movement over the past five months. The Shanghai Student Federation was established in May 1947, and underwent more than two years of arduous underground work under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries. On the fifth day after the liberation of Shanghai, the Student Federation announced its transition to public activity, jointly forming the preparatory committee of the Shanghai Democratic Youth Federation with other youth organizations in Shanghai, and improved the leadership structure of the Student Federation. Under the leadership of the Student Federation, the number of member units of the Student Federation increased from more than 70 schools before liberation to 324 schools in July, with 110,000 organized students, uniting more than 90% of the university and middle school students in Shanghai. After the liberation of Shanghai, students throughout the city enthusiastically participated in the takeover, celebration of liberation, opposition to silver dollar speculation, elimination of remaining bandits and secret agents, and opposition to enemy blockades; and assisted the People's Government in epidemic prevention, emergency rescue of typhoon disasters, and repair of seawalls. During the summer vacation, the Student Federation mobilized a large number of students to serve in factories and rural areas. In early October, 80,000 students throughout the city enthusiastically participated in the celebration of the birth of the People's Republic of China and the great demonstration to defend world peace. Following this, students throughout the city warmly welcomed the Soviet friends - the Soviet cultural delegation. Students throughout the city have ignited a love for the motherland from the past actions, showing that they are a major and reliable force in establishing and consolidating the Shanghai People's regime. In June and July, under the leadership and mobilization of the Student Federation, more than 20,000 students participated in the Southward Service Corps, the Southwest Service Corps, the East China Military and Political University, and various revolutionary work, demonstrating the students' firm will to carry the revolution through to the end and their resolute support for the People's Liberation Army. At the same time, the students' lives have also received great attention and care from the People's Government. Through the Student Federation Service Department, the government distributed 15,863.6 dan of rice and 1,994 bags of flour to poor students; the recipients were 28,123 people in 124 schools, and 4,215 people in 39 schools received temporary relief funds; 68,837 people applied for public utility preferential certificates through the Student Federation. However, the Shanghai Student Federation also has shortcomings in its work over the past five months: that is, the Student Federation has not adopted more and more effective ways and methods to contact a wider range of students and meet their progressive demands; the executive committee of the Student Federation and the student unions of some schools still have some closed-door work styles, and are not democratic enough on some issues; the work lacks planning and there is no regular summary. In the future, the task of the Shanghai student movement is to implement the enthusiasm of the celebration demonstration into work and study, fully launch a new democratic learning movement, and welcome the great upsurge of economic construction and cultural construction.

    讨论学运当前任务
    沪举行学代大会
    学联报告五个月来工作
    【新华社上海十一日电】上海市第一届学生代表大会已于十日隆重开幕。到学生代表四百三十九人，代表着上海三百四十一个大、专、中学校的十一万八千学生。上海人民市政府陈毅市长、曾山副市长，中共上海市委书记饶漱石、副书记刘晓，市府教育局长戴白韬、高等教育处长唐守愚，著名大学教授陈望道、刘佛年、曹未风、夏坚白、周谷城，教联沈体兰等，以及宁沪沿线各地青联和学联代表等来宾六十余人列席。饶漱石应邀在会上讲话时指出：上海学生和中国学生有其光荣的革命传统，始终与工农两个阶级一起站在斗争的最前线。学生运动今后的任务是加强全市学生的团结，加强学习，学习成为建设新中国的有用人材。大会随即向上海市人民政府、中共上海市委、淞沪警备司令部献旗。继由新民主主义青年团华东工作委员会书记李昌讲话，他指出学好建设新中国的本领已为广大同学迫切要求，应该是此次大会讨论和解决的中心。会上，全国学联代表陈震中把国际学联送给中国学联的新式油印机献给大会，全场报以热烈的鼓掌。大会并通过致函国际学联，表示衷心的感谢。大会会期四天（自十日至十三日），主要议程是讨论上海市学联五个月来的工作报告和上海学生运动的当前任务，并通过上海学联章程。大会期间，市学联并在大新公司三楼举行学运资料展览，有照片、贴报，过去学联秘密的机关报学生报，国民党匪特中统局、伪警察局、伪警备司令部等成叠的黑名单——“匪嫌学生名单”，特种刑庭的爱国学生的罪嫌记录册，上海学生自“一二九”以来的斗争纪录，以及解放前后上海学生护校斗争，解放后组织人民宣传队、反银元投机、搜捕匪特、劳军、救灾等工作纪录。是日上海各大报纸均出学生代表大会特刊并发表社论，庆祝大会开幕。
    【新华社上海十三日电】在沪市首届学生代表大会上，上海市学生联合会执委会报告五个月来的学生运动工作。上海市学联成立于一九四七年五月，在国民党反动派统治下经过了两年余艰苦的地下工作。上海解放后的第五天，学联即宣布转入公开，与上海各青年团体共同组成上海市民主青年联合会筹备会，并健全了学联的领导机构。在学联领导下，七月间学联会员单位即由解放前七十余校增加到三百廿四校，有组织的学生达十一万人，团结了全上海大中学生百分之九十以上。上海解放后，全市学生曾热烈参加接管、庆祝解放、反对银元投机、肃清残余匪徒特务、反对敌人封锁等运动；并协助人民政府进行防疫、紧急抢救台灾和抢修海塘的工作。在暑期中，学联会动员了广大同学到工厂和农村中服务。十月初，全市有八万学生热烈参加庆祝中华人民共和国的诞生和保卫世界和平的大示威。接着，全市学生又热情欢迎了苏联友人——苏联文化代表团。全市学生已从历次的行动中燃烧起对祖国的热爱，显示了他们是建立和巩固上海人民政权的一个重大可靠的力量。六七月间，在学联领导和动员下，有二万余学生参加南下服务团、西南服务团、华东军政大学、以及各种革命工作，表现了学生们将革命进行到底的坚强意志和对人民解放军的坚决支援。与此同时，学生们的生活也得到人民政府极大的重视和关心，通过学联服务部，政府配给了贫苦学生米一五八六三点六石，面粉一九九四包；受配给者一二四校二八一二三人，领得临时救济金的有三十九校，四二一五人；通过学联申请公用事业优待证的有六八八三七人。但沪市学联在五个月来的工作中，也存在着缺点：这就是学联还没有采取更多和更有效的方式方法，联系更广泛的同学，满足他们的进步要求；学联执委会及若干学校的学生会，还有某些关门主义的工作作风，在一些问题上还不够民主；工作计划性差，没有经常的总结。今后上海市学生运动的任务，是把庆祝示威的热情贯彻到工作学习中去，全面展开新民主主义的学习运动，迎接伟大的经济建设高潮和文化建设高潮。
