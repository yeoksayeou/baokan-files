Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 5th -- TASS, Berlin: The German-Soviet Friendship Month began on November 1st. The Berlin branch of the German-Soviet Friendship Association issued a statement emphasizing that the Soviet Union is the only major power that has consistently advocated for the unification of Germany in international conferences. The statement said that the establishment of the German-Soviet Friendship Association is bound to be valued by all progressive Germans, especially the people of Berlin, the capital of Germany. During the Friendship Month, gatherings will be held in various factories and institutions. Representatives of the German people and the Soviet scientific, cultural, and artistic circles will also hold gatherings. The German-Soviet Friendship Association is increasingly becoming a mass organization. On November 7th, to celebrate the 32nd anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, the German-Soviet Friendship Association will hold many celebrations and exhibitions specifically introducing the life of the Soviet people in various districts of Berlin.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 5th -- Polish Press Agency, Warsaw, November 3rd: Farmers in Wiołdzin, Poland, wrote to farmers in Soviet collective farms, congratulating them on the October Revolution Day, stating: On the eve of the 32nd anniversary of the great socialist October Revolution, we, the farmers united in the Agricultural Cooperative Union of Wiołdzin, extend our warm fraternal greetings to you. We deeply know that we regained our freedom thanks to the soldiers of your Red Army. When our land was barren and lacked grain for sowing, we received help from you, not from others. This help enabled us to increase the sown area. We are eager to know how you work collectively. During the Polish-Soviet Friendship Month, we organized a Polish-Soviet Friendship Group and decided to study the biography of your and our mentor, Stalin, on his seventieth birthday.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 5th -- TASS, Bucharest, November 3rd: The Romanian-Soviet Friendship Week, celebrating the 32nd anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution, has begun simultaneously with exhibitions, soirees, and other programs. Celebrations will be held universally in various parts of Romania on the 7th.
    The "Soviet Leadership's Struggle for Peace" exhibition held in Bucharest opened on the 2nd. Leaders of the Romanian Workers' Party, the Presidium of the National Assembly, and the Soviet delegation that came to Bucharest to participate in the Romanian-Soviet Friendship Week all attended the opening ceremony. Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party and Minister of the Interior, said in his speech: The friendship between honest people all over the world and the Soviet Union demonstrates the consolidation of the peace and anti-imperialist front. Since the great socialist October Revolution, the struggle for human happiness and for peace has been carried out with ever-increasing vigor. The loyalty of the world's first socialist country to the noble cause of peace is the embodiment of the characteristics and purpose of Soviet society.

According to TASS, Prague, November 3rd: The Czechoslovak-Soviet Friendship Week in Czechoslovakia has also begun. On the 2nd, Czechoslovak President Gottwald delivered a radio speech, and mass rallies were held in various cities and villages.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 5th -- TASS, Helsinki: The Finnish-Soviet Friendship, Culture, and Cooperation Month, sponsored by the Finnish-Soviet Association, began on the 1st. The Finnish Communist Party's organ stated: The purpose of this movement is to develop friendly relations between the two countries based on the principles pointed out by Marshal Stalin, Head of the Soviet Government, in his speech at the time of signing the Finnish-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance. The current Finnish government not only has not implemented these principles that conform to the interests of the Finnish people, but also uses all methods to worsen Finnish-Soviet relations, attempting to lead Finland into the political line of countries preparing for a new war. The Finnish people support the initiative of the Finnish-Soviet Association and celebrate the Finnish-Soviet Friendship, Culture, and Cooperation Month together. The development of cultural cooperation between the two peoples means the consolidation of the friendship between the two peoples and world peace.

    举行友好月、友好周
    【新华社北京五日电】塔斯社柏林讯：德苏友好月已于十一月一日开始。德苏友好协会柏林分会特发表声明，着重指出苏联是历次在国际会议上主张德国统一的唯一大国。该声明说，德苏友好协会的成立，必然受到一切进步的德国人，首先是受到德国首都——柏林的人民的重视。在友好月内，各个工厂机关都将举行集会。德国人民与苏联科学、文化和艺术界的代表们也将举行集会。德苏友好协会正日益成为群众的组织。在十一月七日庆祝伟大十月社会主义革命的三十二周年纪念时，德苏友好协会将在柏林各区举办许多庆祝会和专门介绍苏联人民生活的展览会。
    【新华社北京五日电】波兰通讯社华沙三日讯：波兰维奥杰宁的农民，写信给苏联集体农场的农民，祝贺十月革命节，内称：在伟大的社会主义十月革命三十二周年纪念日的前夜，我们，团结在维奥杰宁的农业合作社联盟的农民们，谨向你们致热烈的兄弟的敬礼。我们深知：我们重获自由是靠了你们红军的战士。当我们的土地荒芜、缺乏谷物播种的时候，我们获得了你们的、而不是别人的帮助。这种帮助使我们能够增加播种面积。我们热烈地愿意知道你们是怎样集体工作的。在举行波苏友好月期间，我们组织了一个波苏友好小组，并决定了在你们和我们的导师斯大林七十寿辰那天学习他的传记。
    【新华社北京五日电】塔斯社布加勒斯特三日讯：为庆祝十月社会主义革命三十二周年的罗苏友好周，展览会、联欢会等节目已同时开始，罗国各地并将于七日普遍举行庆祝。
    布加勒斯特举办的“苏联领导争取和平的斗争”展览会于二日开幕。罗马尼亚工人党的领袖、国民议会主席团以及来布加勒斯特参加罗苏友好周的苏联代表团，均参加开幕典礼。罗马尼亚工人党中委会书记、内政部长乔治斯库致词称：全世界的正直的人民与苏联的友谊，表明了和平与反帝阵线的巩固。自伟大的十月社会主义革命以来，争取人类幸福和争取和平的斗争，就以愈益加强的活力进行着。世界上第一个社会主义国家之忠诚于崇高的和平事业，就是苏维埃社会的特质和目的之体现。
    另据塔斯社布拉格三日讯：捷克斯洛伐克的捷苏友好周业已开始举行，二日捷总统哥特瓦尔德广播演说，各城市乡村纷纷举行群众大会。
    【新华社北京五日电】塔斯社赫尔辛基讯：芬苏协会主办的芬苏友好、文化与合作月已于一日开始。芬兰共产党机关报称：这一运动的目的，是要以签订芬苏友好合作及互助条约时苏联政府元首斯大林大元帅演说中所指出的原则为基础，以发展两国间的友好关系。现在的芬兰政府不只没有执行这些符合于芬兰人民利益的原则，而且利用一切方法恶化芬苏关系，企图把芬兰导入正在准备新战争的国家的政治路线中去。芬兰人民支持芬苏协会的倡议，并一齐来庆祝芬苏友好、文化与合作月，两国人民文化合作的发展意味着两国人民友谊与世界和平的巩固。
