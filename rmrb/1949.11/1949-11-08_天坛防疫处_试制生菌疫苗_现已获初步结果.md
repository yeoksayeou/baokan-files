Tiantan Anti-Epidemic Station
Trial-Produces Live Bacteria Vaccine
Preliminary Results Now Obtained
[This Newspaper News] Plague live bacteria vaccine is a live bacterial suspension made from plague bacilli that have lost their virulence. In the past decade, its use in Java, the Dutch East Indies, the Soviet Union, and Northeast China has proven it to be safe and reliable. At least one million people have been injected without incident. Its efficacy is several times stronger than that of killed vaccines (according to Northeast China’s anti-epidemic experience, three to five times stronger), and the injection dosage and frequency are also more economical than killed vaccines (killed vaccines require three injections, totaling two and a half to three cubic centimeters, while live bacteria vaccines only require one injection of one cubic centimeter). However, the production of live bacteria vaccines must be extremely strict, and there are no such products in China yet. In order to meet current needs, the Tiantan Anti-Epidemic Station began researching and manufacturing live bacteria vaccines some days ago. Dr. Tang Feifan, the director of the station, personally conducted the experiments and carried out careful identification of the Otten strain (the non-toxic strain used by Otten, the pioneer of live bacteria vaccines) and the Soviet strain. After several days of intensive work, preliminary results have been obtained. Injection of large numbers of live bacteria into guinea pigs has proven harmless. Within days, the first batch of 20,000 cubic centimeters of live bacteria vaccine will be produced. After it is proven to be completely safe, formal production will begin, and mass production is being prepared. It is reported that the output can reach 500,000 to 600,000 cubic centimeters per day, and the supply of vaccines can be guaranteed in the future.

　　天坛防疫处
  　试制生菌疫苗
  　现已获初步结果
    【本报讯】鼠疫生菌苗是用失去毒力的鼠疫杆菌制成的活细菌悬液。近十年来在爪哇、荷属东印度、苏联以及我国东北使用结果，已证明其安全可靠，至少已注射了千余万人未发生意外。效力则较死菌苗强数倍（根据东北防疫经验强三至五倍），而且注射剂量及次数也比死菌苗经济（死菌苗须注射三次，一共两个半至三公撮，生菌苗只要注射一次一公撮）。但是生菌苗在制做时须格外严密，我国尚无此种出品。天坛防疫处为了配合当前需要，已在若干日前开始研究制造生菌苗。该处处长汤飞凡大夫亲自动手试验，并对欧藤氏菌（生菌苗首倡者欧藤氏所用之无毒菌种）及苏联菌种进行了慎密的鉴定。经若干日紧张工作，已有初步结果，用大量活菌注射天竺鼠已证明无害，日内当可有第一批生菌苗二万余公撮制成，经证明完全安全后即正式生产，并准备大量制造。闻产量可达每日五六十万公撮，以后菌苗供应当可保证无缺。
