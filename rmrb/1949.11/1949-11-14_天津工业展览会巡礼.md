The Tianjin Industrial Exhibition has been open for a week since its opening on the 4th of this month. This is a great review of Tianjin's industrial production and a great creation of the working class. Tianjin is the largest port in North China. After Tianjin's liberation, the imperialists threatened, "China cannot survive without them." Now, this industrially significant exhibition is a powerful answer to the imperialists.

More than 1,700 factories are participating in the Tianjin Industrial Exhibition, with approximately 8,000 exhibits. There are also industrial products from Shanghai, Beijing, Hangzhou, Qingdao, Zhangjiakou, Shijiazhuang, Tangshan, Yantai, and agricultural products brought by farmer representatives from Hebei Province. The exhibits are displayed in eleven pavilions: public utilities, chemical industry, export goods, iron and steel machinery, out-of-town industry, textiles, electrical appliances, industrial improvement, metallurgy and kiln industry, daily necessities, and food. The entire venue demonstrates the path of developing production and prospering the economy.

Tianjin was forcibly opened as a commercial port by imperialists a hundred years ago. Since then, the development of Tianjin's industry and commerce has had a strong semi-colonial character. The raw material sources or finished product sales of most factories often relied on imperialism. After Tianjin's liberation in January of this year, many difficulties existed in the process of transforming the semi-colonial economy into an independent and autonomous New Democratic economy. Especially due to the huge changes in public-private relations and labor-capital relations, the relationship between workers and staff, and workers and capitalists was abnormal in the early days of liberation, and production discipline in factories was very lax. Industrial production faced difficulties in both raw materials and sales. However, these difficulties have been continuously overcome through ten months of arduous struggle. Now, Tianjin's labor-capital relations are relatively normal; the dependence on imperialism for industrial raw material demand is gradually being shaken off. The Tianjin Industrial Exhibition tells us that Tianjin's industry has not only recovered, but is also developing. Currently, there are a total of 69 public factories in Tianjin, excluding railways, with 40,500 employees; there are more than 10,500 private factories with 57,400 employees. Among these factories, cotton spinning is the most numerous, followed by acid and alkali, machinery, iron and steel, as well as matches, rubber, wool spinning, flour, paper making, and cigarettes. Various charts and statistics in the industrial exhibition show that Tianjin's industrial production has generally been increasing since liberation. The output of many factories has exceeded that before liberation, and they are planning to expand or build new factories. For example, most of the 63 factories in the rubber industry were in a state of semi-shutdown before liberation, but now 71 are actively producing, and the products are in short supply. Comparing June of this year with July of last year, bicycle tires increased by 123%; rubber shoes increased by 405%; and bicycle and truck inner tubes increased by 115.5%. Among the public industries, the thirteen units under the Tianjin Military Control Commission's Industrial Department had a surplus equivalent to 110 million catties of millet at the end of August. The output of various units under the Industrial Department has significantly increased. Taking the highest monthly output before liberation as 100, the increase in production after liberation is as follows: steel ingots 404.6, ferromanganese 703.5, printing paper 590, looms 265.2, reprocessed salt 373, cotton yarn 115.4, and various other products also exceeded the pre-liberation output. Tianjin Zhongfang has rebuilt its No. 7 factory, which was destroyed by artillery fire, and established a new textile factory, which began production in September. Private factories such as Hengyuan, Beiyang, and Dasheng Yarn Factories, and Renli and Dongya Wool Weaving Factories have also developed their production, and Dongya is also planning to build a new factory. The machinery manufacturing industry was on its last breath before Tianjin's liberation. Only half of the 219 private factories were operating, and only a quarter of the more than 2,000 machine tools were running. Now, more factories have been added, with a total of 4 state-owned factories and 345 private small and medium-sized machine factories, with more than 5,000 machine tools in operation. Due to the smooth flow of urban-rural relations, sales have greatly increased. Small and medium-sized iron factories and iron foundries sold a total of 1,587 tons of pots and farm tools in the three peak months of March, April, and May, an increase of more than 70% compared to the same period last year.

In the Industrial Exhibition, we also saw the creativity of the people. More than 200 types of created, imitated, and invented machines are displayed in the Industrial Improvement Pavilion. Among them, the steam engine manufactured by Huang Wangfu is small in size, stable, easy to manufacture, and can use both coal and firewood as fuel, and can be used as a power source for power generation, steamships, farms, etc. The nut-cracking machine made by Yang Mengchang can crack more than 1,000 catties of almonds per day, which is 140 times more than manual labor; the medicine-cutting machine can cut 7,000 catties per day (manual labor can only cut 30 catties per day); the electric incubator made by Zhou Yunfeng has three types with 2,000, 6,000, and 16,000 capacity, and another type of incubator that does not use electricity is also made, which makes a great contribution to rural sideline businesses. Chen Lianren made a new type of plow that allows one ox to do the work of two. The manual waterwheel of the Dachang factory is very light and convenient, and the manual corn-threshing machine of Fulongxing can thresh 1,200 catties per day, which are all very suitable for rural use.

In addition, workers in various factories strive to improve quality, improve technology, and save materials. For example, the coal consumption per ton of wire rod by steel rolling workers in the Tianjin Steel Plant has been reduced from 407 catties to 356 catties; the electricity consumption has been reduced from 86 degrees to 69 degrees, and the phosphorus and sulfur content of the produced steel has been reduced to below 0.5. The cloth inspection rate of China Textile has increased from 85.63% to 90%; the amount of cotton used per piece of yarn has been reduced from 415 catties to 400 catties; the strength of 20-count yarn has increased from the standard of 65 pounds to more than 87 pounds.

The Tianjin Industrial Exhibition demonstrates the great prospect of China's industrialization. It proves that the creative power of the working class is unlimited, and the people who have stood up are invincible.

    天津工业展览会巡礼
    新华社通讯
    天津工业展览会于本月四日开幕以来，已经一个星期了。这是天津工业生产的大检阅，是工人阶级的伟大创造。天津是华北第一大港口，天津解放后，帝国主义者曾经威吓说：“中国离开了他们就活不下去。”现在这个有着严重战斗意义的工业展览会，就是给予帝国主义者的一个有力的回答。
    参加天津工业展览会的工厂有一千七百余家，展览品约有八千多种，并有上海、北京、杭州、青岛、张家口、石家庄、唐山、烟台等地的工业品和河北省农民代表带来的农产品。展览品陈列共分公用事业、化学工业、出口物资、钢铁机械、外埠工业、纺织、电器、工业改进、冶矿窑业、日用品、食品等十一个馆。整个会场表现了发展生产繁荣经济的道路。
    天津是一百年以前在帝国主义胁迫下被开辟为商埠的。自那时以后，天津工商业的发展，带有浓厚的半殖民地性质。多数工厂的原料来源或成品推销，往往依靠着帝国主义。今年一月天津解放后，在转变半殖民地的经济为独立自主的新民主主义经济的过程中，曾经存在着许多困难。特别是由于公私关系、劳资关系上发生了巨大的变化，所以在解放初期，工人与职员、工人与资本家间的关系不正常，工厂中生产纪律十分松弛。工业生产的原料、销路，都发生困难。但是，这些困难经过十个月来的艰苦奋斗，终于不断地被克服。现在天津的劳资关系已经比较正常了；在工业原料的需求上，已日益摆脱对于帝国主义的依赖。天津工业展览会就告诉我们：天津工业不但已经恢复，并且正在发展。现在天津全市公营工厂除铁路外共六十九个工厂，职工四万零五百人；私营工厂共一万零五百余家，职工五万七千四百人。这些工厂中，以棉纺为最多，其次为酸碱、机器、钢铁以及火柴、橡胶、毛纺、面粉、造纸、卷烟等。在工业展览会的各种图表和统计上，表现着解放后天津工业生产一般是上升的。许多工厂的产量已超过解放前，并正在计划扩大或筹建新厂。如橡胶业的六十三个工厂，在解放前大部处于半停工壮态，现在已有七十一家积极生产，产品供不应求。以今年六月与去年七月相比，自行车外胎增产百分之一二三；胶鞋增产百分之四○五；自行车及货车内胎增产百分之一一五·五。公营工业中天津军管会工业处所属十三个单位，八月底结算盈余约合小米一亿一千万斤。工业处所属各单位的产量，均有显著提高。如以解放前最高月产量为一○○，则解放后的增产情况钢锭为四○四·六，锰铁为七○三·五，印刷纸为五九○，织布机为二六五·二，再制盐为三七三，棉纱为一一五·四，其他各种产品亦均超过解放前产量。天津中纺已重建其被炮火摧毁的第七厂，并建立了新的纺织厂，已于九月开始生产。私营工厂如恒源、北洋、达生等纱厂，仁立、东亚等毛织厂生产均有发展，东亚并正在筹建新厂。机器制造业在天津解放前奄奄一息，二一九家私营工厂中开工的只有一半，二千多台工作母机中转动的只有四分之一。现在则增添了工厂，共有国营工厂四家、私营中小机器厂三百四十五家，已开动工作母机五千余台。由于城乡关系的通畅，销路大增。中小铁工厂和铸铁业在三、四、五月份三个旺月中，共卖出锅和农具一千五百八十七吨，比去年同期多销百分之七十以上。
    在工业展览会中，我们又看到了人民的创造。在工业改进馆中陈列的创造、仿造与发明的机器有二百余种。其中黄王符制造的蒸气机，体积小，稳固，易于制造，燃料用煤用柴均可，可作发电、汽船、农场等原动力。杨孟长造的打核机，日打杏仁千余斤，比人工大百四十倍；切药机日切七千斤，（人工只能日切三十斤）；周云峰制造的电气孵卵机，有二千、六千、一万六千三种型，另制一种不用电力的孵卵机，对农村副业贡献很大。陈连仁造新式耕犁，用一个牛可作两个牛的活。大昌工厂的人力水车，非常轻便，福隆兴的人力搓玉米机，日搓一千二百斤，都极适合农村使用。
    此外，各工厂工人努力于提高质量，改进技术，节约材料。如天津制钢厂轧钢工人每吨盘条用煤由四○七斤减至三五六斤；用电由八六度减至六九度，所产钢含磷与硫的成分降低到○·五以下。中纺整布率由百分之八五·六三，提高到百分之九十；每件纱用棉量由四一五斤减至四○○斤；二十支纱强力由标准量六五磅提高至八七磅以上。
    天津工业展览会展示了中国工业化的伟大远景。它证明工人阶级的创造力量是无限的，已经站起来的人民是不可战胜的。
