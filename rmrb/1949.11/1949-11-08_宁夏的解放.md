　　The Liberation of Ningxia
　　*People's Daily* Ningxia Correspondence
　　Crossing the Desert

　　Carrying the glory of liberating Lanzhou, the People's Liberation Army's victorious spearhead pointed to Ningxia on September 7th. Closely following the already terrified Ma family bandit troops, they bravely advanced 800 *li* and achieved the victory of liberating Ningxia.

　　Autumn in the Northwest is a rainy season. On the march, large villages were scarce, and it was difficult to encounter settlements with more than ten households. A certain division advancing along the north bank of the Yellow River victoriously passed the "poor four stations" between Jingtai County and Zhongwei County, and then crossed a desert area. The soldiers prepared thoroughly along the way, filling all their grain sacks and bringing enough cooked dry rations, so they were not afraid of difficulties. They declared heroically: "The more dry rations we pack, the better we can survive in this poor place. No matter how far the road is, we guarantee everyone won't go hungry!" As they approached the desert, the mountains became taller and more numerous, and there was not a single household or a well for every thirty *li*. The soldiers endured. When they stepped into the desert, the soldiers joked, "Like a young woman getting married, this is the first time!" In an endless desert, everyone was sweating profusely. The weather seemed to be deliberately making things difficult, as it had been raining every day, but today there were no clouds in the sky. The intense sun made people thirsty and their lips dry. Relying only on the water and pears brought in advance to quench their thirst was just a "drop in the bucket." Those who have not personally experienced the life of fighting in the desert will not understand the sweetness of a bowl of muddy water at this time and in this place.

　　In the desert, the only magic weapon for our army to overcome difficulties was mutual assistance. A moving story emerged: Communist Party member Wang Yuxiang endured his thirst and gave the water he was carrying to a sick comrade, without drinking a single drop himself. Soldiers everywhere were competing to carry machine guns, small cannons, and large mess kits. Cook Ma Shilin, fearing that others would take away the mess kit, tied it to his body.

　　People camped out every day; only the sick and some command personnel were treated to resting indoors. The soldiers described their own war life this way: "Lying on the ground, covered by the sky, pillowing sand pits, with feet kicking the Yellow River!" When everyone crossed the thirty *li* desert wearing shoes, the shoes filled with sand, which was difficult to endure, so they simply took off their shoes and walked barefoot.

　　Everywhere the army went, it left a deep and good impression on the Hui compatriots. A certain division passed through Baiyankou Village, located at the junction of the Gansu and Ningxia mountainous areas, in the pouring rain. The entire village had fewer than six households, and there were no villages forty *li* ahead or forty *li* behind. The troops would rather be rained on than enter the mosque. The fourth company of a certain regiment could not find lodging and squeezed under the eaves of the mosque all night, resolutely implementing the Hui people's code of conduct.

　　Difficulties could not be overcome in the face of heroic soldiers. Where there were no houses, the soldiers put up quilts as tents; where there were no pots, they used tin pot lids and tin military shovels to bake flatbread to eat; where there were no mills, the soldiers ate whole wheat kernels for three to five days at a time. On the 14th, a certain regiment stayed in a village. It rained, and most of the troops had no housing. Everyone dug caves and built tents with grass, regardless of fatigue, and spent the rainy night in the border region. On the 18th, the regiment stayed by a sandy beach. The whole regiment could not find a single blade of grass, and the ground was wet near the river. The soldiers ran to the hills, took dry sand, and spread it in their "tents" to spend the night. The wind on the beach blew sand and dust everywhere, and the tents moved several times a night. Later, they dug the sand half a person deep, then spread dry sand, solving the difficulty of camping on the beach.

　　Giving the Ningxia Ma Clique a Heavy Blow

　　A certain division advanced along the south bank of the Yellow River, closely pursuing the enemy. The vanguard regiment didn't even have time for breakfast on the 16th when they received the order to "pursue the enemy." They marched 40 *li* in three hours in the mud, catching the enemy at Changlebao in Zhongwei County.

　　"The enemy can't escape! Chase!" The soldiers had long forgotten the fatigue of being rained on all day yesterday and rushed towards the village occupied by the enemy. By the time the enemy realized it, the brave soldiers were already upon them. Two companies of the enemy were eating and were taken prisoner. Hearing that there was a regiment of the enemy in the village, the first platoon of our Ninth Company attacked the village. When they arrived in the village, the enemy was still drying things and eating. When the enemy recognized the newcomers as the People's Liberation Army, bayonets were already approaching their chests. Bandit regiment commander Sun Tiancai ran out of the house, wanting to direct the resistance, but was the first to be captured. Our one platoon wiped out a regiment of the enemy. Two battalions of the bandit 103rd Regiment desperately fled to the ferry, attempting to run to the north bank of the river, but were also taken prisoner. The 881st Regiment of the 294th Division of Ma Bandit's 81st Army, the 103rd Regiment (missing one battalion) of the 35th Division, and a company of the 880th Regiment were completely annihilated in two hours.

　　This was a heavy blow to Ma Hongkui's bandit troops in Ningxia.

　　Ningxia Ma Bandit Troops Seek Surrender

　　In the editorial "Celebrating the Great Victory of Liberating Lanzhou," the *Z弟兵报* of a certain corps of our army pointed out: Our army annihilated the elite of the Qing Ma bandit troops and liberated the important city of Lanzhou, like a knife inserted into the enemy's heart, first geographically cutting off the enemy's connections, which would facilitate our subsequent annihilation of the enemy in separate directions. The victory in Lanzhou caused the reactionaries to lose their political center in the Northwest, which had a great impact on the enemy internally. The victorious prestige of our army and the enemy's disastrous defeat were bound to increase the panic, wavering, and confusion within them...

　　When the first hammer struck the head of Ma Bandit's 81st Army in Ningxia, Ma Yan Jing, the commander of the 81st Army, first took a leather raft from the north bank of the Yellow River to the south bank on the 19th to request surrender to the People's Liberation Army. Since then, small boats with red flags on the Yellow River have been carrying representatives of both sides back and forth daily. Under the influence of the victorious situation of our army, the "Ningxia Peace Delegation," representing the 128th Army and other units, also contacted to surrender on the 21st.

　　Our corps submitted eight peace conditions to the surrendering armies, asking them to sign at the designated location on September 24th.

　　Since then, Yinchuan City has been actively preparing to welcome the People's Liberation Army into the city. Starting from September 7th, the march towards Ningxia lasted only eighteen days, and the entire province of Ningxia was declared liberated.

　　宁夏的解放
    本报宁夏通讯
　　横跨荒漠
    带着解放兰州的光荣，人民解放军胜利的矛头于九月七日又指向了宁夏。紧紧尾追着早已闻风丧胆的马家匪军，英勇前进八百里，又取得了解放宁夏的胜利。
    西北的秋天，是多雨的季节；进军的路上，缺乏大村，很难遇到十家以上的庄子。沿着黄河北岸进击的某师，胜利通过了景泰县到中卫悬之间的“穷四站”，又横跨了沙漠地带。途中战士们准备充分，灌满了所有的粮袋，带足了热干粮，因之面对困难毫无惧色。他们毫语着：“干粮袋装的多，背上要在这穷地方过，任凭你路有多么远，保证人人不挨饿！”快接近沙漠时，山更多更大了，三十里遇不到一家人，一口井。战士们忍耐住了。当跨进沙漠时，战士们戏谑的说：“大姑娘做媳妇，这是第一次呀！”一个一望无际的沙漠，啃的人人热汗直流；天又来和人为难，本来天天阴雨，而今日却万里无云，强烈的太阳，晒得人口渴唇干。单凭事先带来的壶水和梨来解渴，那只是“杯水车薪”了。半路遇见一个泥池，每人分了一碗水，虽然只是浑浊泥汤，但战士们连连赞为“救急水”。没有亲身体验沙漠征战生活的人，将不会领会到这时这地一碗泥水的甜蜜。
    沙漠上，我军克服困难的唯一法宝是互助。动人的故事出现了，共产党员王玉祥忍住了渴，把背在身旁的水留给病号喝，自己连一口也不喝。战士们到处在争着背机枪、小炮和大行军锅，炊事员马士林，怕别人抢去行军锅，便把行军锅捆在身上。
    天天有人露宿，只有病号和一部分指挥人员才受到进房休息的待遇。战士们自己这样描述自己的征战生活说：“铺着地，盖着天，枕着沙土窝，脚蹬黄河边！”大家穿着鞋子跨过三十里大沙漠时，沙灌满了鞋壳，不好忍耐，索性把鞋子脱下，光着脚走。
    军队到处，在回民同胞中留下了深刻的良好印象。某师在阴雨绵绵中通过甘（肃）宁（夏）山区交界上的白沿口村，全村不到六户人家，前去四十里，后退四十里，都没有村了，部队宁肯雨淋，都不肯进清真寺，某团的第四连一个排实在找不到住宿地方了，便挤在清真寺外的房檐下站了一夜，坚决执行了回民守则。
    困难在英雄的战士们面前，是没有克服不了的。没有人家，战士们搭起夹被当帐篷；没有锅用洋铁锅盖，洋铁军用铲把饼烙了吃；没有磨，战士们吃整麦粒，一吃就是三、五天；十四日某团住在了一个村庄，天下雨，部队大部没房住宿，大家不顾疲劳挖山洞，找草搭帐篷渡过了这塞上雨夜。十八日，该团又住在一个沙滩边，全团找不到一根草，又是河边湿地，战士们跑向山丘，取了干沙来，铺在“帐篷”里渡夜。沙滩的风吹的灰沙乱舞，帐篷一夜挪动数次，后来把沙子挖了半人深，再铺上干沙，解决了沙滩露营的困难。
　　给宁马沉重的一击
    某师沿着黄河南岸进击，紧紧抓住敌人不放，前卫某团十六日的早饭没顾上吃，便接到“追击敌人”的命令。泥泞中以三个钟头四十里的急行军，在中卫县的常乐堡把敌人抓住了。
    “敌人跑不了啦！追！”战士们早忘了昨天一天的雨淋疲劳，一直向敌盘踞的村子扑去，等敌人发觉的时候，勇士们已到了跟前，敌人两个连正在吃饭，便当了俘虏。听说村里有敌人一个团，我们的九连一排便向村里打去，打到村中，敌人还正在晒东西吃饭，当敌人辨清来者是解放军时，刺刀已逼近了胸口。匪团长孙田才从房子里跑出来想指挥抵抗，就首先做了俘虏，我们一个排解决了敌人一个团。匪一○三团的两个营在拼命向渡口逃，企图跑到河北去，也都做了俘虏。马匪的八十一军的二九四师的八八一团，三十五师的一○三团（缺一个营）和八八○团的一个连两个钟头全部干脆被残灭了。
    这便是进入宁夏对马鸿逵匪军的沉重打击。
　　宁马匪军求降
    我某兵团子弟兵报在“庆祝解放兰州的大胜利”社论中曾指出：我军消灭了青马匪军的精锐，解放了兰州这一重要城市，就象一把刀子插在敌人的心脏，首先从地理上分割了敌人的联系，便于我今后分路歼敌。兰州的胜利，使反动派在西北失去了政治中心，这对敌人内部的影响是很大的，我军胜利的声威和敌人的惨败，必然要增加他内部恐慌动摇和混乱。……
    当第一铁锤打在宁马匪军八十一军头上时，马匪八十一军军长马＠靖，十九日首先坐了皮筏子从黄河北岸渡到河南来向人民解放军要求投降。自此黄河面上插着红旗的小船载着双方代表日日往返着。在我军的胜利形势影响下，“宁夏和平代表团”代表着匪一二八军等部，也在二十一日接洽投诚。
    我兵团以八项和平条件提交投诚各军，让他们在九月二十四日到指定地点签字。
    自此银川城里便积极筹备欢迎人民解放军进入城。从九月七日开始向宁夏进军，历时仅仅十八天，宁夏全省即宣告解放。
