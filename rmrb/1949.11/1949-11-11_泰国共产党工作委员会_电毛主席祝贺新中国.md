    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 10th] Bangkok's "Quan Min Bao" in Thailand on October 7th reported: The 185th issue of the Thai "Dazhong Bao" published a telegram from the Working Committee of the Communist Party of Thailand congratulating the founding of the People's Republic of China as follows: Dear Comrade Chairman Mao Zedong:
    We are delighted to learn of the convening of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the proclamation of the People's Republic of China, unprecedented in the history of the Asian people.
    The victory of the Chinese people in their struggle against imperialist reactionary forces and their running dogs is also the victory of the Thai people and the people of the world. The experience and lessons of the Chinese revolution are also the experience and lessons of our Thai revolution. The Communist Party of Thailand is determined to draw on your valuable experience and lessons to organize a national and democratic united front at home and abroad to promote the friendly unity of the Chinese and Thai brothers and sisters, and to fight together for the democracy and independence of Thailand, and to destroy the chains that imperialism has used to bind the Asian people for a century.
    Our Communist Party of Thailand and all progressive people congratulate:
    Long live the People's Republic of China, a solid fortress for the Asian people to fight for independence!
    Long live the people's forces fighting for independence, equality and democracy!
    Down with imperialism!            Working Committee of the Communist Party of Thailand
              September 26, 1949
