    Foreword

    The result of this general election has produced an atmosphere of being carried away by victory within the Party, which is very bad. Remarks such as "Look at those weaklings in the Socialist Party!" or "Our area is excellent, but other places are not." have been expressed quite strongly. This is clearly wrong and reflects the thinking of social democrats. Our main enemy—the conservative reactionary forces—clearly holds an overwhelming victory; compared with the last election, its number of votes increased by 14 percent, and the number of seats increased by 25 percent. In particular, the most reactionary of the reactionaries, the Democratic Liberal Party, occupies more than half of the seats. This is definitely not a time for us to revel in victory, but rather tells us that it is a time when we must strengthen the fight even more. Therefore, we should not only be humble and modest towards the masses of the people, but also be sincere and modest towards the Socialist Party, the Labor-Farmer Party, and the people's democratic organizations, in order to establish a united front and cooperation. We cannot look at problems from a local or partial point of view, but should remember the position of the entire class.

    The more victories we achieve, the more we should be humble and modest towards the masses of the people. Conversely, the more resolutely we should fight the enemy. This is precisely the characteristic of our Party. This report, on behalf of the Political Bureau, is developed with such an attitude.

  I. Lessons from This General Election

    This general election should be seen as a concentrated expression of the results of all struggles. It is absolutely necessary to criticize ourselves from this viewpoint in order to determine the necessary activities for the future.

        The Policies of the Democratic Liberal Party Are Bound to Fail

    1.  Did the Democratic Liberal Party's 43.8 percent of the votes and more than half of the seats represent a substantial victory for the Democratic Liberal Party? No. The traitorous policies, broken promises, corrupt and decadent reactionary phenomena of the Socialist Party, the Democratic Party, and the People's Cooperative Party, and the policies and character produced by the Democratic Liberal Party's large-scale shameless buying of votes, cannot gain the genuine trust of the masses of the people. Thus, this overwhelming victory will make them even more arrogant and dictatorial; and this will precisely become a factor in the bankruptcy of its character and policies in the short term.

    Therefore, we should stand with the people with a hundred times the courage and thoroughly expose their weaknesses.

    The Democratic Liberal Party's shocking illegal acts must be thoroughly pursued. Of course, this is a matter of law. But we must severely pursue it politically to the end. And through this struggle, we must make the Democratic Liberal Party's leadership lose the trust of the people, thereby raising the people's class political consciousness.

    Although our Party is gradually getting on track, it has not yet fully exerted its strength. The number of elected officials has not reached the set goal, and we must admit that our assessment of the election was still very inadequate.

    In essence, we are very concerned about the election of democratic organizations, especially trade unions, and have exerted initiative in all aspects. This behavior, which is beneficial to our Party, must not be underestimated.

    In general, there has been success in forming a united front with the Labor-Farmer Party; and with the Socialist Party, unified work has been carried out in some areas. In many places, they decided to join our Party in large numbers, causing their organization to disintegrate. Regardless of whether we were elected in those places at the forefront of the unification movement or not, this united front work always enhanced our Party's prestige among the masses in the general election and brought broad national benefits. However, in some places, anti-people things have happened because they intentionally sabotage the united front, either openly or covertly, benefiting the hostile classes and leading the election in an unfavorable direction.

    The Labor-Farmer Party is not a strictly class party, so it inevitably carries the characteristics of social democracy. Therefore, we must pay full attention because we do not yet have the confidence to crush the enemy's use of it to carry out anti-people undertakings.

        Clearly Demonstrating the Leading Force of the Working Class

    2.  The working class, as the driving force of the revolution, clearly exerted its strength in this general election. In the six major cities, our Party won the second largest number of votes, second only to the Democratic Liberal Party. At the same time, the working class has been completely victorious in emerging as the leader of the peasants and small and medium-sized industrialists and merchants and consolidating their alliance. This is also very evident in local electoral districts.

    What shows the weakness of the working class's leading force is that in the area where peasant struggle is its main force, our Party has achieved almost no success in this regard. We must pay attention that this is a very important matter and a guide for future struggles. (Refer to Akahata, January 29th issue)

        Overcoming Blank Areas and Its Significance

    3.  One of the important factors in winning this general election was overcoming blank areas. The number of votes obtained in areas other than the six major cities increased three and a half times. Secondly, the thirteen regions, led by the third district of Fukushima, increased by more than five times, which is a good proof (the six major cities increased by 2.8 times).

    However, the understanding of the significance of blank areas is not thorough enough. The decision of the Central Committee clearly pointed out that the so-called blank areas do not only refer to rural areas, mountain villages, and fishing villages, but also exist in cities, industrial sectors, and even among the small and medium-sized urban population. Due to insufficient understanding of this significance, the work only focused on rural areas and mountain villages. But comparing the actual results of the general election, there are still achievements in blank areas. We must create new tactics with more enthusiasm and strive to overcome difficulties.

        Practicing the Agricultural Program

    4.  The real victory in the countryside is the implementation of the agricultural program of the Sixth Congress, the land struggle led to a successful direction, and further advanced to the struggle for political power. At the same time, cultural struggles were also launched. This is the same in mountain villages and fishing villages. A particularly important issue is land reform (in mountain villages, it includes mountain forest issues, and in fishing villages, it includes fishing rights issues). If this matter is not resolutely implemented, and even hidden land is not exposed, then the Party's support will not be consolidated. Therefore, we must never forget that combining the general struggle of the peasants with the working class, that is, consolidating the establishment of the working class's leadership in the countryside, is extremely important.

        Fully Develop the United Front

    5.  We must do everything we can to expand the united front in the future!

    Of course, the merger issue with the local organizations of the Labor-Farmer Party and the Socialist Party is a more urgent task at present. When merging, the following question often arises: Will both parties completely dissolve and then reorganize their new party from an empty base? In the current situation of fierce class struggle, relaxing the fighting weapon of this "organization" and allowing the enemy to take advantage of it is tantamount to suicide and forgetting the fundamental purpose of expanding the united front. The merger issue must be continuously strengthened under the banner of Marxism-Leninism, and its quality and quantity must be improved.

    Regarding the joint struggle with the Socialist Party, the answer we received from the Central Executive Committee of the Socialist Party is that they want to draw a line between them and our Party; but this is not a big problem. The Central Executive Committee of the Socialist Party will change its nature through practice. Therefore, we should be more humble and sincere, stand with the masses of the people, and move towards the success of the united front.

    We must not forget that the important thing about the above two issues is to establish a common struggle with their lower-level organizations and handle specific local issues. And the key to solving the problem lies in our enthusiasm and how the practice of the people's struggle, which is enough to arouse all the people, is carried out.

    Trade unions, peasant associations, cooperatives, cultural groups, etc., are all eagerly hoping to expand the united front and are striving for its success on the political front. We must not forget its importance for a moment and strive to complete it.

    In short, it must be remembered that forming a united front is the most powerful weapon to defeat the Democratic Liberal Party. We must often publicize this significance to the masses of the people and use the masses of the people to put pressure on the Democratic Liberal Party to form the united front we expect.

        Winning Over Women and Youth

    6.  Winning the support of women and youth is a matter of great significance in the victory of this general election. There is no need for me to say more. Here, I should raise a few points that are worth noting as a reference for carrying out work in the future.

    First, it must be understood that the organization of children's groups plays a significant role in both the women's movement and the youth movement. The various departments of the Party organs do not fully understand this point. However, once this work is implemented, it will indeed receive great results. Only our Party members, with a spirit of dedication, can sincerely meet the needs of children and nurture them. If we grasp the children's organization, women and young men and women will quickly gather around them. Moreover, children grow up quickly. It depends on how you train them. The propaganda power and organizational power exerted through them should not be underestimated. We already have peep shows, slides, and children's publications, etc. In the future, we must expand it so that each small unit of the children's organization has at least a full set of children's toys and books.

    Second, winning the support of women and youth is the most important task of Party organs at all levels. Until now, it has been thought that women's work should be borne by female comrades, and youth work should be borne by CYL comrades. Party organs at all levels have not given enough attention to this. Party organs at all levels should eliminate this idea and practice. Women's work and youth work should be seen as the Party's main tasks and infused with great energy.

    Women, especially housewives, must not forget that their scope of action is very narrow. Therefore, to liberate the broad masses of women, we must rely on the strength of men, especially young people, and it is difficult for women's work to break through the old inherited circles by relying solely on their own activities. In particular, young people should respect women and must guide them towards new and beneficial aspects of life. This matter is considered extremely important. Comrades, you should make your wives and the women around you join our Party, and strive to become one with yourselves and your wives.

    Third, splitting up the youth movement and letting the CYL do it alone is the cause of the tendency to lead Party organs and the CYL to unnecessary confrontation. This can be said to be caused by the departmentalism of the various organs, but merely criticizing this point does not solve the problem. Party organs at all levels should lead all youth movements, led by the CYL. If we cannot win the majority of young people to stand on our Party's side, the problem will not be solved. This must be carried out quickly. That is to say, there are two problems that need to be solved:

    (1) The CYL has not yet jumped out of its small circle style, nor has it formed a large group based on the characteristics of the youth movement. This situation must be broken.

    (2) The great unification of the youth front must be carried out quickly. Without establishing the Party's leadership, it is impossible to solve this major problem.

    Fourth, until now, the Party organs have tended to underestimate the student movement. At the national meeting of Party organs in June last year, the importance of the student struggle was pointed out, and it was emphasized that its significance was even greater in the context of the deepening national independence crisis. However, this significance has not been implemented by our Party comrades. And at a time when education is declining, science, technology, and art are becoming desolate, and thus leading to the gradual disappearance of national independence and excellence—that is, the direction of everything being enslaved by foreign capital is becoming increasingly obvious—the student movement is even more important.

    At a time when many excellent scientists, technicians, and artists have successively joined our Party recently, we must pay more attention to the student movement. With the unification of the youth front becoming an urgent task at present, we must pay close attention to using the student movement as an element in winning over the masses of young people. In the past, the student movement was separated from the youth movement. This tendency must be overcome this time.

        Important Weaknesses That Should Be Overcome

    7.  We must overcome the following main weaknesses. These weaknesses made the election unfavorable, which was the most prominent manifestation. Do not make excuses to escape: "My side is special!" Weaknesses must be thoroughly corrected.

    (1) Conservatism, narrow empiricism, and nitpicking fighting methods are an inseparable trinity. When our Party was still young, these things could still bring some effect. But since the decision of the First Plenary Session of the Central Committee in March last year, these shortcomings have been pointed out several times. Although there have been many improvements, they are still deeply rooted. This is not only harmful to election work, but also has a decisive harm to all aspects of the Party's activities. The Nagano County Committee has been working hard to eliminate conservatism since last year, and has launched creative activities in various organs based on the branch. This direction of work is being implemented in many places, and will be fully implemented in the future. Responsible comrades of Party organs at all levels should take on the responsibility of comprehensive guidance.

    To this end, all Party members, especially cadre members, should become Bolshevik politicians. This kind of politician is familiar with the ability to organize the whole and the talents of each person, and can adapt to changes in the situation and exert political flexibility. In this way, we must strive to unify propaganda, organization, and finance.

    (2) Theoretical dogmatism has been widely spread and has caused a lot of harm. We must raise great vigilance about the fact that it is still continuing to spread. This dogmatism not only makes meetings lengthy, resolutions abstract, and lacks practical strength, but also plays a role in disintegrating the Party.

    The most significant feature of this dogmatism is that when implementing the decisions of the higher organs, they always like to pull at threads and discuss whether it is correct or incorrect, to the point of violating the Party Constitution. Dogmatism at most only cultivates some talkers. As a result, they often turn into communists who are out of touch with common sense, bizarre, and repulsive. And now this dogmatism has developed into formalism, bureaucracy, or is developing this tendency. We must strictly overcome it.

    (3) Thinking that I am the best in the world, being arrogant and complacent once I take a leading position, these styles have been combined with the above two shortcomings and have become very harmful things. Especially when carrying out united front work, the harm is even more obvious.

    If we can apply each person's ability according to their talents, give full play to each person's ability, and control each person's ability, then we can be considered to have fulfilled the responsibilities of a leader. To this end, it is necessary to overcome the above three shortcomings and be a true Bolshevik politician.

    (4) Eliminating the departmentalism of Party organs and stopping the self-praise behavior of Party organs is very necessary for the rapid completion of the united front today. Like these shortcomings, which must be overcome no matter what, cannot be allowed to exist, especially at present. This shortcoming is often manifested in verbally acknowledging the Party's policies, but emotionally causing opposition, which is very harmful to the united front.

    (5) Party members must abandon selfish and self-interested psychology. This selfish phenomenon is still quite common within the Party. Therefore, things have happened such as exaggerating achievements and fighting for positions, ignoring the Party's decisions. Only doing things according to one's own preferences, and developing into personal means of winning people over, although small factions have not yet been formed, there is a tendency to develop in this direction. In fact, it is spreading the seeds of disputes within the Party, and eventually developing into violating Party discipline. We must overcome this in a timely manner. In this election, the harm of this shortcoming has been shown. In the future, when establishing a united front and uniting the broad masses of the people to carry out resolute struggles, special attention must be paid.

    (6) The shortcoming of Party internal affairs is also seriously present; therefore, it does not accumulate experience and improve ability. Including this election, elections have been conducted, but we easily abandon most of the previous experience, resulting in great losses. In the future, we must be good at summing up experience, immediately correct shortcomings, and make it a springboard for work to leap forward, and save it as a reference when necessary.

    The serious losses caused by the shortcomings of bureaucratism are financial shortcomings. Not to mention the issue of Party membership dues, there are many shortcomings in the issue of publications and other prices, the issue of funding mass struggles, and even the issue of expenditure. All this must be handled quickly and strictly to consolidate the development of the Party.

    In order to overcome these shortcomings, it is necessary to pay attention to the following two points in particular.

    (1) All actions are an element of class and political effect, not isolated.

    (2) Only by combining with the broad class forces can individual actions have an effect.

        Give Full Play to the Effects Gained in the General Election and Make Them More Developed.

    8.  In this general election, our Party has exerted a certain effect, but we must make this effect more developed. We must pay attention to the following points:

    (1) Party organs and Party members should be humble to the masses of the people in all occasions and dare to criticize themselves.

    That is, to learn from the masses, organize the demands of the masses, and realize the important tasks of our Party in the process of developing the demands of the masses. In this way, our Party can be combined with the masses of the people who are our Party's mother. Once this combination relationship is established, it can be discovered and loved by the masses of the people in our practice. In the future, the matter of being humble to the masses of the people and being brave in criticizing ourselves must be quickly and widely promoted.

    (2) Improve the quality of Party members. The primary education within the Party and the cadre education that has begun must be carried out in depth, thoroughly, and continuously, in order to achieve the task of improving the quality of Party members. Although the Political Bureau had specifically instructed the whole Party on this point during the election period. And in the election, the implementation of this instruction also had good results. In the future, it must be strengthened no matter what.

    I have explained these in detail, but I must also add that using "Akahata" to improve the quality of Party members must be seen as particularly important.

    (3) The quality of Party organs and Party newspapers at all levels must be improved. At the same time, Party organs at all levels must have Party newspapers, and the need to thoroughly expand this is real. The so-called Party newspapers here refer to all Party newspapers, including branch news and wall newspapers.

    This is a major task after the Party's public activities. It is very important to gain the people's trust in the Party and the Party's leadership of the people through it. That is to say, use it as a propagandist and organizer.

    The content of the Party newspaper must be attractive enough to the masses of the people, so as to gain the support of the masses of the people. It must say what the people want to say, grasp the demands of the masses, and further combine with their daily and broad actions, so as to have an effect.

    Party organs at all levels should not let this important weapon be handled by one person. Party organs at all levels should take full responsibility for it. Please refer to the newspapers "New Saitama," "San Tama Minpo," and "Katsushika News," etc., which have achieved many results in the past.

    (4) The youth action team and the cultural work team have achieved great results in overcoming the work in blank areas. There is no need to say more. But their activities are not only to overcome blank areas, but also to serve as extremely useful weapons in the people's struggle in the future. In the future, they must be developed.

    (5) The use of publications has also received amazing results in propaganda organization activities and financial activities. This experience should be applied to overcome the shortcomings of bureaucratism and quickly develop it.

        From Self-Criticism to Thorough Learning

    9.  We must learn thoroughly from self-criticism and achieve results, so as to meet the arrival of various struggles that are becoming increasingly imminent, especially election struggles. And this decision will only take effect if the whole Party immediately implements it. The resolutions of this conference should be immediately notified to the whole Party, and it is hoped that they will be immediately put into effect.

  II. The Victory of the Chinese Communist Party and the Development of the New Situation

    1.  There is no need to say more about the victory of the great Chinese Communist Party. We must learn the following two points from this victory:

    (1) Close integration with the people is the basic factor in the victory of the Chinese Communist Party. All Party organs and the People's Liberation Army have a broad understanding of the significance of the revolution, and implement it with great dedication. Therefore, strict discipline has been generated on this basis. We must expect ourselves to learn from the Chinese Communist Party, cultivate a good Party style in our Party, and practice the same humble attitude and dedication to the masses of the people as the Chinese Communist Party.

    (2) Thoroughly expose the corruption and decadence of the ruling organization of the Chinese Kuomintang. The invasion of foreign capital, which is combined with this corruption and decadence, is precisely the essence of endangering the lives of the people and constituting traitorous behavior.

        The Rapid Development of Democratic Forces

    2.  The victory of the Chinese Communist Party has brought about the rapid development of the world's democratic forces. In particular, the people's liberation struggles in colonial and semi-colonial countries are progressing rapidly. The upsurge of liberation struggles in Indonesia, Burma, and other Southeast Asian countries, and the victory of the Republic of Israel and Greece in the Near East are good proofs.

    The victory of the Chinese Communist Party has also had a great impact on capitalist countries, led by Western Europe. In particular, because the struggle of democratic forces in these countries has a significant relationship with the national independence struggles of colonial and semi-colonial countries, its impact is very profound.

        Giving Two Major Impacts to Japan's Revival

    3.  The victory of the Chinese Communist Party will give two major impacts to our country's revival.

    (1) The Chinese Communist Party's severe demand for strict implementation of the Potsdam Declaration has been reported in Xinhua News Agency's dispatches. This can be said to be a head-on blow to the conservative reactionary forces led by the Democratic Liberal Party.

    (2) Our country's trade, due to the liberation of East Asian countries led by China, is closely integrated under the conditions of mutual guarantee of peace and independence. And it will achieve prosperity and leap forward on the basis of such conditions.

        The Star of Hope for the Working People

    4.  The continuous peaceful development of the socialist and people's democratic countries in politics, economy, and society, especially in economic development, is a great victory for these countries to complete the unified plan and implement it. This victory is a star of hope for the working people and a great encouragement.

        Freedom and Peace and Independence

    5.  The forces of the world's democratic camp all advocate that the people of the world should join hands with each other under the slogan of freedom, peace, and independence. The development of the world's democratic forces will make it a reality.

        The Intensification of Contradictions in Capitalist Countries

    6.  On the contrary, the internal contradictions of international monopoly capital are becoming increasingly acute, and panic is constantly attacking. The lives of the people in all capitalist countries are becoming increasingly difficult, and social unrest is deepening. In order to overcome these phenomena, on the one hand, all capitalist countries are keen on expanding armaments and seizing foreign markets; on the other hand, those who cooperate with monopoly capital within trade unions are busy plotting division in order to weaken the trade unions. Therefore, it has developed into the withdrawal of the right-wing leaders of the British and American trade unions from the World Federation of Labor.

    The above are the two key points in the new development of the international situation. What is important here is that the strength of the people's democratic forces is expanding and strengthening every moment. It constantly eliminates the crisis of the Third World War and continues to move forward, holding high the banner of freedom, peace, and independence.

  III. Sharp Class Opposition

        The Policies of Monopoly Capital

    1.  The economic recovery policy currently adopted by the government is focused on expanding exports. Therefore, it uses coercive methods to thoroughly implement the following measures:

    (1) In order to reduce production costs, thoroughly reduce the people's living standards, which is manifested in the policy of suppressing wages; revising the trade union relations law to become a slave-like relationship; massively laying off employees in the name of streamlining administration and consolidating enterprises; purchasing agricultural and aquatic products at low prices; bankruptcy of small and medium-sized industrialists and merchants, etc.

    When implementing this policy, it is particularly noteworthy that financial capitalists are more active and use financial power to carry out ruthless plunder.

    Facts have proved that it is completely wrong to understand the Democratic Liberal Party as a party representing small and medium-sized entrepreneurs, national capitalists, and landlords, and standing in the opposite position to the monopoly kingdom of financial capitalists.

    Obviously, the Democratic Liberal Party is the most violent lackey of financial capital. It is a well-known fact that the financial capital tycoon Ikeda Narabin is Yoshida's most powerful accomplice. But this does not deny that the Democratic Liberal Party is combined with reactionaries, landlords, and senior bureaucrats, nor does it prevent it from using small and medium-sized entrepreneurs as its social base.

    (2) At present, trade has formed the sad phenomenon of the ratio of imports to exports being three to one. And the import price is very high, about three to seven times higher than the domestic official price. On the contrary, the export price, with the Japanese market price (wholesale price) being one, and the price in the New York market is twice, or even as high as ten times, reaching an incredible state of unequal trade.

    From this, it is not difficult to see whose interests are being served by trade. As a result, there is no other way to exist except as an appendage of foreign capital. Therefore, the more exports expand, the more the people's lives go bankrupt, and the more our nation accelerates into becoming a slave of foreign capital.

        The Exchange Rate Issue

    2.  Although the unification of the exchange rate is desperately implemented, the ratio of one US dollar to 300 to 350 yen, except for the particularly protected cotton, coal, and steel industries, all other industries will have to tend to destruction. Therefore, capitalists are all holding a fearful mentality, and thus, from February 1st, the reserve rate is determined to be 450 yen. Even so, about 40 percent of enterprises and more than half of the important exports are not cost-effective. As for imports, due to their large quantity, if the exchange rate rises to 450 yen, the losses will be even greater, which is a terrible thing.

    When the exchange rate is about 300 yen, the export subsidy is 500 to 600 billion yen, and the import subsidy is about 120 billion yen. When the exchange rate is 450 yen, although the export side is reduced somewhat, it will not be less than 30 billion yen anyway. On the contrary, the import side has risen shockingly high, about 250 billion yen. It is said that the price subsidy in the government's budget for next year is planned to be about 70 billion yen, but this is a complete lie. Therefore, setting the single exchange rate issue cannot but become a cause for a large increase in taxes. And this will also strengthen administrative streamlining and repression policies.

        The Defense of National Culture

    3.  The current increasing capital offensive is obviously for the purpose of becoming an appendage of foreign capital. And needless to say, it is going to the road of monopoly capital dictatorship and fascism. I believe that the details do not need to be explained here.

    At such a time, it is only natural that we must fight back against the capital offensive for the benefit of workers, farmers, and fishermen. At the same time, we must also understand that it is urgent and necessary not only to support small and medium-sized industrialists and merchants, but also to protect national capital that is not colluding with foreign capital.

    We must not forget! National culture, science, technology, and art, and all cultures related to these, are almost abandoned due to the capital offensive. And it is going in a direction of thorough withering in an extremely profound way. Therefore, the struggle against the capital offensive is very important. Economic and political struggles need to be expanded and enriched with cultural struggles. Secondly, we must pay more attention to the class struggle in thought. This issue must pay attention to the point that the class struggle in thought will gain strong support from the struggle to protect national culture, thus also strengthening the speed of its own development.

        Sharp Class Opposition

    4.  Accordingly, the intensification of class opposition is inevitable. Although the government and capitalists continue to take all compromise work, it will not have any effect. It can be said that the people's offensive will inevitably be strengthened with opposition to layoffs, opposition to wage cuts, opposition to compulsory double purchases, opposition to harsh taxes, and the conduct of fierce land struggles as its bases.

  IV. Three Main Tasks of the People's Struggle

    1.  Of course, the stability of the people's lives is the most important point. All struggles are closely related and inseparable from this point. There should be three main goals of the struggle:

    (1) The struggle from the current abnormal state to a normal state, that is, the struggle to restore the pre-war state. In other words, to improve the current people's lives, which have fallen to a quarter of the pre-war level, four times, the struggle for such a goal is the essence of today's struggle.

    The current massive state of starvation is related to the illegal plunder of monopoly capital. Therefore, the "vicious cycle" of wages and prices is rapidly and continuously rising. So, to overcome this phenomenon is inextricably linked with the struggle to restore the pre-war state.

    (2) Abolish the mass taxation that accounts for 70 percent of prices, and prices must be reduced by one-third or more. On the other hand, mass taxation is constantly bankrupting industries, and in this regard, it can gain the support of even small and medium-sized entrepreneurs.

    If the labor income tax is abolished, income can be increased by about 30 percent, and thus the people's purchasing power can be increased four times.

    (3) To struggle to destroy the struggle weapons used by the government such as wage cuts, layoffs, trade union laws, and others, to struggle for the interests of farmers, fishermen, small and medium-sized industrialists and merchants, and to struggle for general economic demands, all this is the center of the problem. What is important in these struggles is that they are closely linked to the above two main problems.

    2.  In order to comprehensively sweep away the various reactionary institutions, it is very necessary to thoroughly expose their corruption and illegal behavior, especially to eliminate the speculators in the lower-level organs.

    At present, if all economic, political, social, and cultural struggles are not combined with the struggle to expose corruption and illegal behavior, then we can hardly move forward. Therefore, this issue should be fully considered in all occasions.

    In order to make various election struggles, especially the general election struggle, effective, the struggle of exposing work must be carried out frequently.

    What is most important now is to expose the major smuggling crimes of major capitalists and major black market merchants. Because it is particularly closely related to corrupt bureaucrats and speculative organizations, this must also be exposed at the same time. Secondly, it is also closely related to hoarders and black market merchants. We should not forget that the important issue is to overthrow the foundation of the conservative reactionary forces. Special attention must be paid to the fact that the cancellation of mass taxation and the opposition to layoffs and other repression policies have a significant relationship with it.

    When exposing illegal behavior and corruption, it must not be forgotten that the exposing work should be turned to political struggle.

    3.  Eliminating the waste of monopoly capital and its lackeys is related to trade, unnecessary public works, and corruption from senior bureaucrats to illegal behavior and corruption below the city, town, and village level. Therefore, a thorough struggle must be carried out. In this regard, like the struggle against illegal behavior and corruption, it should be linked to all daily struggles, and the issue of financial resources must be raised as an important part of the struggle.

    4.  The people's revival struggle for their own interests not only involves various economic issues, but also involves various social and cultural issues, especially the relief of the unemployed and all war victims, all of which are significantly related to the revival struggle.

    Therefore, this struggle often needs to be combined with the higher goals of national independence and development.

    5.  The struggle against the introduction of foreign capital by monopoly capital is undoubtedly closely related to all current struggles, especially the struggle against policies that suppress laborers and policies of great plunder. However, what we must emphasize here is that the traitorous character of monopoly capital has the effect of expanding the crisis of the Third World War and has a significant relationship with moving towards fascism.

    Regarding the use of foreign capital, our Party has a clear position: it must be a credit loan obtained from abroad by the state for the benefit of the people. The slander of our Party by other parties must be combated.

    6.  Concluding a peace treaty for freedom, peace, and independence, and promoting freedom, peace, and independence through this treaty, is our Party's most basic propaganda. But it must also be emphasized that this propaganda is closely linked with stabilizing the people's lives, national independence, and the happiness of all mankind, and greatly expand its propaganda.

    7.  The issue of realizing people's democracy, that is, how to establish a people's democratic regime, is the issue of how the current people's struggle is concentrated. Therefore, this people's democracy must be emphasized in all struggles.

    Needless to say, to complete the above tasks of the people's struggle, a people's united front must be established.

    At this time, we must strive to expand the united front; all people's classes, except compradors, should be gathered within this united front. Needless to say, the Party must be the center and vanguard of this united front.

    I think the main task of this report, especially to carry out the struggle for this purpose, there is no need to say more.

    Therefore, more important than anything is to expand the Party and consolidate the Party. The basic significance of the issue of merger between the Socialist Party and the Communist Party also lies in this. Therefore, it should be believed that even if it leads to some disadvantages for a while, such as in elections, etc., it should be for the sake of completing a greater purpose, and we must break through various small obstacles and move forward bravely.

    Therefore, the Party, as the revolutionary leader and vanguard, must be fully rectified. I cannot but repeat that the self-criticism of the general election mentioned at the beginning is particularly important in the rectification of the Party.

    The people's struggle in the future must have greater development than before in terms of quality and quantity. The major significance of the issue of quality lies in grasping the basic points of the revolution. In order to win the majority of farmers, the land revolution issue is fundamental, and all struggles will degenerate to the side of the lackeys of monopoly capital - the Democratic League (referring to the old Democratic League - translator) if they do not develop into the struggle for political power. The struggle for political power is also fundamental.

    The issue of quantity is not only important for the mutual "vertical combination" of the same class, such as workers, but also necessary to expand the "horizontal connection" in all classes. In this sense, carrying out regional struggles in a certain area has a significant effect. But this development is still weak. It must be further strengthened to attract the largest number of classes. Even in the same class, it should gain its greater majority. In this sense, regional struggles are important. And quality and quantity must also be expanded in the same way.

    Of course, it must be expanded according to local conditions, and developed into a national struggle from this. The more the situation develops, the more necessary it is to eliminate conservatism, narrow empiricism, and nitpicking fighting methods and become a Bolshevik politician. We first need to quickly overcome the various weaknesses mentioned above, and at the same time, we must quickly develop the various advantages that we have

    德田球一在日共五中全会的报告与总结
    （一九四九年二月五日）
    （杨正译  王任叔、庄涛校）
    前言
    此次大选的结果，党内产生了胜利冲昏头脑的气氛，这是很不好的。“你瞧！社会党的孱头们。”或者说：“我们地区可出色啊，别的地方不行。”这样的气氛相当强烈的表现出来。这明白是错误的，是社会民主党的想法。我们正面的敌人——保守反动势力，明显地占着压倒的胜利；与上次相比较，得票数增大百分之十四，议席数增大百分之二十五。特别是反动中最反动的民主自由党，占了议席的过半数。这决不是我们陶醉于胜利的时候，而是告诉我们：是必须更其加强战斗的时候。因此我们不仅对人民大众应该谦逊，虚心，即对社会党、劳农党及人民民主团体，也应诚恳虚心，以期建立联合战线与合作。我们是不能以地方性的或局部性的观点来看问题的，而应该记住全阶级的立场。
    愈是胜利就愈应对人民大众谦逊和虚心。反之，对敌人则愈应坚决斗争。这正是我党的特质。代表政治局的这个报告，就是以这样态度来展开的。
  一、此次大选的教训
    此次大选应该看作是全部斗争成果的集中表现。从这一见地来批判自己，以备决定将来必要的各项活动，乃是完全必要的。
        民主自由党的政策一定破产
    １、民主自由党得票百分之四十三点八，议席超过半数，这是民主自由党实质上的胜利吗？不是的。社会党、民主党、国民协同党的卖国政策、背叛诺言、腐败堕落的反动现象，和民主自由党大规模的无耻收买行为所产生的政策与品格，是得不到人民大众真正的信任的。从而，这次压倒的胜利将使他们更加骄傲专横；而这恰恰成为它的品格与政策将在短期内破产的因素。
    因此，我们应勇气百倍与人民站在一起，彻底揭露他们的弱点。
    民主自由党可惊的犯法行为，必须彻底追击它。当然，这是法律的问题。但我们必须严峻地在政治上追击到底。并通过这一斗争，使民主自由党的领导机构失去人民的信任，从而提高人民底阶级的政治意识。
    我党虽说已经渐上轨道，但尚未充分发挥力量。当选数字并未达到预定目标，必须承认我们对选举的估计，还是非常不够的。
    我们实质上是非常关心以工会为首的民主团体的选举，发挥了各方面的自动性的。这一有利于我党的行为，决不能予以过低的评价。
    跟劳农党搞统一战线，大体上是有成绩的；跟社会党搞统一工作，一部分地方是有开展的；许多地方，他们决定大量加入我党，致使他们的组织瓦解。不管站在统一运动先头的那些地方，我们当选与否；而这一统战工作总是提高了大选中我党在群众中的威信，带来了全国性的广大利益。但是在部分地方，也有反人民的事情发生，那是他们有意破坏统一战线，或公开、或隐蔽，有利于敌对阶级，而把选举导向不利。
    劳农党并非严格的阶级政党，即不可避免会带有社会民主党的性格。所以我们必须充分注意：因为我们尚没有粉碎敌人利用它来进行反人民事业的把握。
        明确地发挥了工人阶级的指导力量
    ２、作为革命推动力的工人阶级，在这次大选中明显地发挥了它的力量。我党在六大都市中所得票数，仅次于民主自由党而成为第二大党。同时，工人阶级在作为农民和中小工商业者的领导者而出现并巩固和他们的联盟这方面，是完全胜利了。这在地方选举区里也是很明显的。
    显示工人阶级领导力量薄弱的，那是以农民斗争为其主力这方面，我党在这方面是几乎没有成绩的。我们必须注意：这是件非常重大的事，是今后斗争的指针。（参照赤旗报一月二十九日号）
        空白地区的克服和它意义
    ３、这次大选获得胜利的重要因素之一，就是克服了空白地带。六大都市以外的地方所得的票数，增加三倍半，其次，以福岛第三区为首的十三地区增加了五倍以上，这就是很好的证明（六大都市增加二点八倍）。
    但是，对空白地带意义的了解，是不够彻底的。中央委员会的决定，明白地指出：所谓空白地带不仅仅指农村、山村、渔村，还存在于城市里、产业部门里，甚至中小市民阶层里，由于不甚了解这一意义，致使工作只偏重于农村及山村。可是对照一下大选的实际成绩，空白地带还是有成绩的。我们必须以更多的热诚，创造新战术，努力克服困难。
        实践农业纲领
    ４、农村中的真正胜利，是实行了第六次大会的农业纲领，土地斗争导向成功的方向，更前进到为政权而斗争。同时还展开了文化斗争。关于这在山村、在渔村都是一样的。特别重大的问题是上地改革（山村中包含山林问题，渔村中则为渔业权问题）。如果不坚决地去实行这件事，甚至连隐瞒的土地也不给以揭露，那么党的支持是不巩固的。因此我们决不应忘记通过农民一般斗争和工人阶级相结合，也就是说，巩固地建立农村中工人阶级的领导，是极为重大的事情。
        全力发展统一战线
    ５、今后必须竭全力来扩大统一战线！
    当然，跟劳农党及社会党的地方组织合并问题，是当前更急切的任务。当合并时，往往会发生这样的疑问：是否两党全部解散以后，会重从空基地上去组织其新党呢？处在目前激烈的阶级斗争情势下，松懈了这一“组织”的斗争武器，让敌人有机可乘，这无异是自杀行为，也是忘记了扩大统一战线的根本目的。合并问题必须在马克思列宁主义旗帜之下，不断加强组织，并提高它的质和量。
    关于跟社会党进行共同斗争，社会党中央执行委员会给我们的回答是，他们和我党是要划出一条界线来的；但这并不是大问题。社会党中央执行委员会是会经过实践而改变其性质的。因此，我们更应虚心诚意，跟人民大众站在一起，向统一战线底成功方向前进。
    我们切不可忘记，以上两个问题重要的是，跟他们下层组织建立共同斗争以及各地方具体问题的处理。而问题解决的关键，在于我们的热诚与夫足以奋起全体人民的人民斗争底实践如何。
    工会、农会、合作社，文化团体等都热烈希望扩大统一战线，且在政治战线上也努力争取其成功，我们一刻也不能忘记其重要性，并努力来完成它。
    总之，必须记住，结成统一战线是打倒民主自由党最有力的武器。我们必须经常向人民大众宣传这一意义，并借人民大众给民主自由党以压力，而结成我们所预期的统一战线。
        争取妇女与青年
    ６、争取妇女和青年的支持，是这次大选胜利中有重大意义的事。那是不用我再说了的。在这里应该提出值得注意的几点，作为今后开展工作的参考。
    第一、必须理解：儿童会的组织，不论在妇女运动里，在青年运动里，都有其重大的作用。关于这点，并不是党机关的各部门都很了解的。但是，一旦把这工作实行起来，确确实实收到了伟大的效果。能真心诚意适合孩子要求，来培育孩子的，只有抱着献身精神的我党党员能够做到。如果一经把握住儿童组织，那么妇女和男女青年就会很快地在他们周围集拢来。而且，儿童是很快成长的，只看你训练如何，借他们而发挥的宣传力与组织力，是不可作过小的评价的。我们已有了拉洋片、幻灯和儿童出版物等等。今后必须扩大，使每一儿童组织的小单位，至少有全套的儿童玩具和书籍。
    第二、争取妇女与青年的支持，是成为各级党机关最重大的任务。到现在为止，都认为妇女工作由妇女同志来负担，青年工作由青共同志来负担，这就行了。各级党机关都没有给以足够的注意。各级党机关应该扫除这种想法和作法。妇女工作，青年工作应看作党的主要任务，贯注以极大的精力。
    妇女，特别是主妇，不要忘掉她们的行动范围是很狭窄的。因此为解放广大的妇女群众，就必须借助于男子，尤其是青年的力量，而且妇女工作仅靠妇女自己活动，那要突破旧日因袭的圈子是很困难的。特别是青年，应该尊重妇女，并须把她们导向新生的有益的生活方面。在这件事看作极为重要。同志们，你们应该把自己的妻子以及周围的妇女使之加入我党，并努力使自己和妻子打成一片。
    第三、把青年运动，光让青共去做，这一种分割的做法，是把党机关与青共导向无谓的对立的倾向的原因，这可说是各机关的本位主义所造成的，但仅仅指摘这一点，问题并没有解决。各级党机关应该领导以青共为首的一切青年运动。如果不能争取大多数青年，站在我党这方面，问题就解决不了。这是要赶快进行的。这就是说，有两个问题要求解决：
    （一）青共至今还没有跳出小圈子作风，也不曾根据青年运动特点组成大集团，这种现状必须打破。
    （二）必须迅速进行青年战线底大统一。如果没有确立党的领导，要解决这一重大的问题，是不可能的。
    第四、直到目前为止，党的机关对学生运动有轻视的倾向。去年六月全国党机关的会议上，曾指出学生斗争的重要性，并强调在民族独立危机加深的场合，其意义更为重大。可是这一意义没有为我党同志贯彻。而当此教育日趋衰退，科学、技术、艺术日趋荒弃，并因而导致了民族独立优秀底日趋消失——即一切为外国资本所奴役的方向日趋明显——的今天，学生运动是更为重要了。
    在最近许多优秀的科学家、技术家、艺术家陆续参加我党这一时候，我们对学生运动必须更加重视。在青年战线的统一成为当前紧急任务的现在，必须密切关注：以学生运动作为争取青年群众的一个要素。从来学生运动是和青年运动分割开来的，这回必须克服这种倾向。
        应该克服的重要弱点
    ７、我们必须克服下面这些主要的弱点。而这些弱点使选举陷于不利，这是最显著的表现出来了。不要借口逃避：“我这方面是特殊的！”必须彻底改正弱点。
    （一）保守主义、陕隘的经验主义、钻牛角尖的斗争方式，这是三位一体不可分离的东西。当我党还年青时候，这些东西还能带来几分效果。但自去年三月第一次中央全会决定以来，已经几次指出这些缺点。虽然有好多改进，但还根深蒂固存在着。这不仅有害于选举工作，而且对党一切活动方面，都有决定性的害处。长野县委员会，已于去年以来努力肃清保守主义，且以支部为基础，展开各级机关的创造性活动。这一工作方向，许多地方正在被实行起来，今后更要全面实行，各级机关的负责同志，应该担负起全面指导的责任。
    为此，全党党员，特别是干部党员，应该都成为布尔塞维克的政治家。这种政治家，就是熟悉组织全般的能力和各人的才能，并能适应情势的转变，发挥政治的机动力。如此就必须努力将宣传、组织、财政统一起来。
    （二）理论上的教条主义曾经广泛传播，为害不少。而至今还继续传播，这件事必须提起重大的警惕。这种教条主义不仅使会议冗长，决议抽象，丧失实践力量，而且会起着瓦解党的作用。
    这种教条主义最显著的特征，就是实行上级机关决定之际，总爱牵丝＠①藤，讨论其正确或不正确，直到违反党章的程度。教条主义最多也不过养成一些清谈家而已。其结果往往变做脱离常识的、奇形怪状的共产主义者，而臭不可近。而现在这种教条主义已经发展为形式主义、官僚主义，或者正在发展着这种倾向，我们必须严格予以克服。
    （三）老子天下第一，一登领导地位，就傲慢自满，架子十足，这些作风已跟上述两种缺点相互结合，而成为非常有害的东西了。尤其是执行统一战线工作时，其害处是更为明显的。
    如果能够因材适用，发挥每个人的能力，并统摄每个人的能力，那才算是尽了领导者的职责。为此，就有克服上述三个缺点，做个真正布尔塞维克的政治家之必要。
    （四）肃清党机关的本位主义，制止党机关的自吹自捧行为，这对于今日迅速完成统一战线，是非常必要的。象这些无论如何必须要克服的缺点，特别在目前是不能允许其存在的。这种缺点往往表现为口头上承认党的政策，感情上则引起对立，这是十分有害于统一战线的。
    （五）党员必须放弃自私自利心理。这种自私现象在党内仍然相当普遍。因此发生了夸功劳争地位的事，漠视党的决定。只依照自己喜爱行事，且发展为个人的笼络手段，虽然尚未形成小派别，但已有向这方向发展的倾向。它事实上是在党内散布纷争的种子，最后发展到违反党的纪律。这一点我们必须及时予以克服。在这次选举里已显示这种缺点的害处。今后建立统一战线，团结广大人民进行坚决斗争时，必须予以特别注意。
    （六）党内事务主义的缺点，也是严重地存在着；因而不会积累经验，提高能力。连这次选举在内已经进行了竞选，但我们对于从前的经验大半轻易抛弃，致造成了很大损失。今后必须善于总结经验，立即纠正缺点，使它成为工作跃进的跳板，在必要时可作为资料保存起来。
    由于事务主义的缺陷而招致重大损失的，是财政上的缺陷。党费问题那不用说，出版物及其他价格问题、指导群众斗争的费用问题，甚至支出方面的问题，均存在着不少缺点，这一切必须迅速、严格进行处理而巩固党的发展。
    为了克服这些缺点，特别对下列两点有注意之必要。
    （一）一切行动，都是阶级的、政治的效果底一种要素，并非孤立的。
    （二）只有结合在广大的阶级力量里面，个人的行动，才能发生作用。
        发挥大选中所收获的效果，使其更加发展。
    ８、在这次大选中，我党已发挥了一定的效果，但必须使这效果更加发展起来。那就须留意下列各点：
    （一）党机关、党员在一切场合，对人民大众要谦让，并敢于自我批评。
    这就是要向群众学习，把群众的要求组织化，在发展群众要求过程中，来实现我党重要的任务。这样，才能使我党和作为我党的母亲的人民大众相互结合起来。这种结合关系一经成立，在我们实践中就能为人民大众所发见所爱戴。今后对人民大众谦让对自己勇于批判这件事必须迅速而广泛地予以发扬。
    （二）提高党员的素质。已开始的党内初级教育以及干部教育，要深入、澈底、继续进行，借以达到提高党员素质的任务。虽然在选举时期，政治局曾经特别给全党指示过这一点。而在选举中，执行这个指示也有良好成绩。今后，无论如何必须加强进行。
    这些我曾详细的说明过了，但还须附加说到的、是运用“赤旗报”来提高党员素质要看得特别重大。
    （三）必须改善各级党机关和党报的素质。同时各级党机关要有党报，这一点实有彻底扩大的必要。这里所谓党报是指支部新闻直到壁报都包括在内的所有党报。
    这是党公开活动后的一个重大工作，通过它获得人民对党的信任和党对人民的领导，是很重要的。这就是说，把它当作宣传者、组织者来运用。
    党报的内容对人民大众要有足够的吸引力，从而获得人民大众的拥护。它要说人民想说的话，把握群众的要求，更进一步跟他们日常广泛的行动相结合，这样才能发生效果。
    党各机关不应把这一重要武器听任一个人去搞，各级党机关应该负起全部责任来。请参看以前获得不少成绩的“新琦玉”“三多摩民报”“葛饰新闻”等报纸。
    （四）青年行动队、文化工作队对空白地带工作的克服，收到了绝大的效果，那是不用说的了。但他们的活动，不仅是克服空白地带，而且在今后人民斗争中为极其有用的武器。今后是必须加以发展的。
    （五）运用出版物，对宣传组织活动上、财政活动上也收到可惊的效果。应该把这一经验运用于克服事务主义的缺点方面，并迅速地加以发展。
        从自我批评到彻底的学习
    ９、我们必须从自我批评中进行彻底学习，获得成效，俾便迎接日趋迫近的各种斗争的到来，尤其是选举斗争。而这决定只有全党立即实行起来才会生效力的。此次把本大会的决议立即通知全体，并望立刻付诸实行。
  二、中共胜利与新形势的发展
    １、伟大的中国共产党的胜利，不必再多说了。我们必须从这一胜利中，学习如下两点：
    （一）与人民密切结合，这正是中共胜利的基本因素。所有党的机关与人民解放军对于革命的意义，都有广泛的理解，同时以绝大的献身精神来实行它。因而在这基础上产生了严格的纪律。我们必须期望我们自己：学习中共，培成我党好的党风，实践跟中共一样的对人民大众的谦虚态度和献身精神。
    （二）彻底暴露中国国民党统治机构的腐化和堕落。和这种腐化、堕落相结合的外国资本的侵入，正是使生灵陷于涂炭构成卖国行为的实质。
        民主势力的飞跃发展
    ２、中共的胜利，使世界民主主义的力量获得飞跃的发展。特别是殖民地半殖民地国家的人民解放斗争，正在飞跃进展中。印尼、缅甸及其他东南亚各国解放斗争的高涨，近东的以色列共和国及希腊的胜利，就是很好的证明。
    中共的胜利对西欧为首的资本主义各国的影响也很大。特别因为这些国家民主力量的斗争与殖民地半殖民地各国民族独立斗争有重大关系，因而其影响是很深刻的。
        给予日本复兴的两个重大影响
    ３、中共的胜利将给予我国复兴两个重大影响
    （一）中共峻烈地要求严格执行波茨坦宣言的意见，已见诸新华社电讯的报导。这给予民主自由党为首的保守反动势力可说是当头一棒。
    （二）我国贸易，由于以中国为首的东亚各国的解放，在互相保障和平、独立的条件下，紧密地结合起来了。而且将在这样条件的基础上，将获得繁荣与飞跃前进。
        劳动人民的希望之星
    ４、社会主义及人民民主主义各国的政治、经济、社会的继续和平的发展，特别是经济发展方面，这些国家完成了统一的计划并付诸实施，这是个伟大的胜利。这一胜利对于劳动人民是希望之星，是莫大的鼓励。
        自由与和平与独立
    ５、全世界民主阵营势力，均主张在自由、和平、独立的口号下，全世界人民互相携起手来。世界民主主义势力的发展，将会使它成为事实。
        资本主义各国矛盾的激化
    ６、与此相反，国际独占资本其内部矛盾日益尖锐，恐慌不断地袭来，所有资本主义国家人民的生活，日益困难，社会不安日益加深。为了克服这些现象，一方面所有资本主义国家，均热心于军备扩张及夺取国外市场；他方面职工会内与独占资本合作者们，为了削弱职工会正忙于策动分裂的阴谋。因而发展为英美职工会右翼领导者退出世界劳联。
    以上是国际形势新发展的两个重点。在这里，重要的，是人民民主力量一刻刻地在扩大和加强，它不断地排除第三次世界大战的危机，高举自由、和平、独立的旗帜，继续前进。
  三、阶级对立尖锐化
        独占资本的政策
    １、政府目前采取的经济复兴政策，其中于扩大输出的计划上。因此用强制办法，彻底执行下列措施：
    （一）为了减低生产成本，彻底降低人民生活水准，这就表现为压低工资政策；改订工会关系法而变为奴隶化的关系；借整理行政与整顿企业之名，大量裁员；低价征购农产物、水产物；中小工商业者的破产等等。
    当实行这种政策的时候，特别令人注目的是金融资本家更为积极，运用金融力量进行残酷无比的掠夺行为。
    事实证明把民主自由党理解为代表中小企业家、民族资本家及地主而与独占王国金融资本家处在相反的立场的政党那是彻底错误的。
    很明显的，民主自由党，是金融资本最狂暴的走卒。这是周知的事实，金融资本巨头池田成彬是吉田最有力的帮凶。但这并不否认民主自由党和反动分子、地主、高级官僚相结合，也不妨碍以中小企业家作为其社会基础。
    （二）目前贸易已形成输入与输出的三与一之比的可悲的现象。而输入价格甚高，大约比国内公定价格高到三倍至七倍。相反的，输出价格，以日本市场价格（批发价格）为一，而在纽约市场的价格，则为二倍，甚至高到十倍，达到令人难以置信的不等价贸易状况。
    由此不难看出贸易是为了谁的利益？结果除了做外国资本附庸而存在外，别无他途。所以输出愈益扩大，人民生活愈益破产，我们的民族愈益加速沦为外国资本的奴隶。
        汇兑率问题
    ２、虽然拼命地施行汇兑率单一化，但一美元对三百至三百五十日元的比率，除了特别保护的棉业、石炭、钢铁以外，其他工业将全部不得不趋于毁灭。因此资本家均抱着恐惧心理，于是，从二月一日起准备率决定为四百五十元。即使如此，百分之四十左右的企业和重要输出品的一半以上，是不合算的。至于输入方面，因其数量庞大，如汇兑率涨至四百五十元，其损失更大，这是了不得的大事情。
    当汇兑率为三百元程度时，输出补给金为五○○——六○○亿元，输入补给金为一二○○亿元左右。当汇兑率为四百五十元时，输出方面虽然减轻一些，但无论如何不会在三百亿元以下，反之，输入方面则惊人地高涨，大约在二千五百亿元程度。政府明年预算中据说价格补助金，拟为七百亿元左右，但这是澈头澈尾的撒谎。因此订定单一汇率问题，不能不成为大事增税的原因。而这也将连带加强行政整理与弹压政策。
        民族文化底防卫
    ３、目前日益增大的资本攻势，很明显的是为的变作外国资本的附庸。而且不用说，是走向独占资本独裁、法西斯蒂的道路上去的。其详情我相信不必在此说明了。
    在这样时候，我们为了工人、农民、渔民利益，必须反击资本攻势，那是当然的。同时还必须了解：不仅要拥护中小工商业者，而且要保护与外国资本没有勾结的民族资本，这种措施是迫切的和必要的。
    我们不要忘记！民族文化、科学、技术与艺术以及和这些相联系的一切文化，因遭受资本的进攻，几乎荒废了。而且极其深刻的正走向彻底枯萎的方向。因此对资本攻势的斗争，是非常重要的。经济的、政治的各种斗争，有借文化斗争而扩大并丰富其内容之必要。其次，我们必须更加重视的是思想上的阶级斗争。这一问题必须重视这样一点：即思想的阶级斗争将借保护民族文化的斗争，获得强有力的支援，因而也加强了其本身发展的速度。
        尖锐的阶级对立
    ４、据此，阶级对立的尖锐化是不可避免的。政府与资本家虽然继续采取一切妥协工作，但不会有什么收效的。人民攻势将以反对裁员、反对降低工资、反对强制加倍征购、反对苛税与进行激烈的土地斗争等作为据点而日益强化，这可说是必然的。
  四、人民斗争的三个主要课题
    １、当然，人民生活安定，是最重要的一点。一切的斗争是与这一点密切联系不可分割的。其斗争的主要目标应有三个：
    （一）从现时不正常的状态向正常状态，即恢复战前状态的斗争，换言之，把降至战前四分之一的目前人民生活，提高四倍，为这样一个目标而斗争，是今天斗争的本质。
    目前这样大量地陷于饥饿状态，是和独占资本非法的掠夺有关联的。因而工资与物价的“恶循环”迅速地不断上升了。所以要克服这种现象，是与恢复战前状态斗争有不可分割的关系的。
    （二）废除占物价百分之七十的大众课税，必须要降低物价三分之一以下。另一方面大众课税使产业不断破产，在这点上是能得到甚至中小企业家的拥护的。
    如果废除劳动所得税，就可增加百分三十左右的收入，因而人民购买力可提高四倍。
    （三）为摧毁降低工资、裁员、工会法及其他等等政府所使用的斗争武器斗争，为农民、渔民、中小工商业者的利益而斗争，为一般经济要求而斗争，这一切就是问题的中心。这些斗争，重要的事是跟上述二个主要问题密切联系起来。
    ２、为了全面扫荡各反动机构，对彻底揭露其腐败与犯法行为，尤其是肃清下层机关的投机分子，是非常必要的。
    目前所有经济、政治、社会、文化各方面的斗争，如果不与揭露腐败与犯法斗争结合起来，那我们几乎不能前进一步。因此在一切场合，对这一问题应予以充分考虑。
    要使各种选举斗争，特别是大选的斗争能获得效果，就必须经常进行揭露工作的斗争。
    现在最重要的是揭露大资本家，大黑市商的大走私罪行。因为它特别和腐败官僚、投机组织有密切联系，所以也必须同时揭露这一点。其次，它和屯积物资黑市商亦有密切的关联，我们不应忘记，重要问题是在于推翻保守反动势力的根基。尤须注意的，取销大众课税与反对裁员及其他弹压政策，和它有重大的关系。
    揭露不法行为与腐败时，切不可忘记，应由揭露工作转向政治斗争。
    ３、肃清独占资本及其走狗的浪费现象，是与贸易、不必要的公共事业，以及从高级官僚等的浪费到市、镇、村以下的不法行为、腐败等等联系着的，因此必须进行彻底斗争。在这点上，与向犯法行为及腐化作斗争同样，应与所有日常斗争联系起来，特别财源问题为其重要斗争的一环，必须提出。
    ４、人民为自己利益而进行的复兴斗争，这不仅涉及各种经济问题，而且涉及社会、文化等各种问题，尤其涉及失业者与所有战祸受害者的救济等问题，都和复兴斗争有重大关系。
    因此这一斗争经常有和民族的独立与发展的更高目的相结合的必要。
    ５、对独占资本导入外资的斗争，不用说是和现在的一切斗争有密切关系的，尤其是对镇压以劳动者为首的政策及大掠夺政策的斗争，有重大关系。但是，在这里我们必须强调的是独占资本的卖国性格，是有扩大第三次世界大战危机的作用，并进向法西斯主义的重大关系的。
    利用外资，我党曾有明确的主张：它必须是为了人民而由国家负责向国外取得信用贷款。其他党派对我党的诽谤，必须予以打击。
    ６、为自由、和平独立缔结和约并借这和约而促进自由、和平与独立，这是我党最基本的宣传。但还必须强调这一宣传与安定人民生活，民族独立，和全人类幸福密切结合起来，大大地扩大其宣传。
    ７、实现人民民主主义这个问题，就是如何建立人民民主政权，就是当前人民斗争如何集中表现的问题。因此在所有斗争上必须强调这一人民民主主义。
    不用说，要完成上述人民斗争的任务，就必须建立人民统一战线。
    我们在这一时候，必须努力扩大统一战线；除买办分子以外，包括一切人民阶层都应结集在这一统一战线以内。不用说，这一统一战线的结成，党必须是它的中心，而且是它的先锋。
    我认为这一报告的主要任务，尤其是为这目的而进行斗争，已无再多说的必要了。
    因此，较之任何事情为重要的，是扩大党，巩固党。社共合并问题，其基本意义亦在于此。因此，应该相信：即使一时的，例如在选举等等工作中招致些不利，但应该为了完成更大目的着想，必须突破各种小障碍奋勇前进。
    因此，作为革命领导者及先锋的党，便有充分整顿之必要。我不能不重复地说，最初论及的大选的自我批评，在整党方面是特别重要的。
    今后的人民斗争，质与量方面，必须比以前有更大的发展。质的问题，其重大意义是在于掌握革命的基本点。我们为了争取大多数的农民，土地革命问题就是基本的，还有一切斗争如果不发展为政权斗争，那将会堕落到独占资本的走狗——民主同盟（指旧的民主同盟——译者）方面去，政权斗争也是基本的。
    量的问题，不仅在同一阶层例如工人们的互相“纵的结合”是重要的，而在一切阶层中，扩大其“横的联系”也是必要的。在这意义上，在一定地域里进行地域性的斗争就有其重大的作用了。但是这种发展还是微弱的。更须进一步加强，更多地把最多数的阶层吸引过来。即使同一阶层中，还应获得其更大多数。在这意义上，地域性斗争才是重要的。而且质与量也要同样来扩大。
    当然，必须根据地方情况进行扩大，并由此发展为全国的大斗争。形势愈是发展，肃清保守主义、狭隘经验主义的与钻牛角尖的斗争方式，而成为布尔塞维克政治家愈是必要。我们首先需要迅速地克服上述各种弱点，同时必须迅速发展我们强调过的各种优点。
  五、结语
    我们的一切斗争就确实证明了从来党的各种政策，尤其是第六次大会以及其后的各种决议，均是正确的。这个报告的意义，就在于指出：各种斗争的发展，从来各种决定的积极执行，且将借这报告而更向前推进斗争与工作。在今天，必须强调扫除这样的想法：因为有了新决议就全部否定以前的决议。最后，我还须着重地说：在和平、自由、独立的旗帜下，国际的提携合作，是非常必要的事！
