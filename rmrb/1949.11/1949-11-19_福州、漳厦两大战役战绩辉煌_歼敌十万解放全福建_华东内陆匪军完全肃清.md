Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou Front, 18th—The Fujian Front Headquarters of the People's Liberation Army has released a comprehensive battle report on the Fuzhou and Zhangzhou-Xiamen campaigns, stating that after the Second Field Army of the People's Liberation Army broke through the Yangtze River defense line of the Kuomintang bandit army on April 20, it rapidly developed towards the southeast, penetrating deep into Fujian. In less than a month, from May 9 to June 5, it successively liberated 13 county towns in northern and central Fujian, including Pucheng, Chong'an, Jianyang, Jian'ou, Shaowu, Shunchang, Nanping, Fuding, Shaxian, Tuorong, Longxi, and Gutian. At the same time, a unit of the Third Field Army breaking through the Yangtze River from the east, after jointly liberating Shanghai, Asia's largest metropolis, with fraternal forces, accepted the glorious task of advancing into Fujian in early July, replacing the Second Field Army to clear out the Kuomintang bandit forces remaining on the southeastern border of the motherland. After a long march of thousands of miles, crossing the Xianxia and Wuyi Mountains, which stretch 800 miles along the Fujian-Jiangxi border, and overcoming various difficulties such as barren mountains and scorching heat along the way, the unit of the Third Field Army arrived at its designated location in early August. On August 13, three spearheads of the People's Liberation Army launched a sudden attack on Fuzhou. At noon on the 17th, an elite unit of the People's Liberation Army entered Fuzhou City from the east, north, and west, eliminating a part of the bandits. On the 18th, the majority of the two fleeing enemy forces were annihilated northeast of Fuqing and northwest of Yongtai. By this time, of the more than 58,000 Kuomintang bandit troops originally stationed inside and outside Fuzhou, except for the headquarters of the 73rd Army, which led a division to flee to Pingtan Island, more than 50,400 were killed, wounded, captured, or routed. Fuzhou City, the capital of Fujian Province, the famous naval ports of Mawei and Sandu'ao, the Changmen Fortress, and 15 counties including Dening, Luoyuan, Lianjiang, Minhou, Changle, Fuqing, and Yongtai were all liberated. On September 10, after the People's Liberation Army captured Pingtan Island southeast of Fuzhou, it advanced rapidly along the Fuzhou-Xiamen Highway, quickly liberating 13 county towns in southwestern Fujian, including Zhangzhou, Haicheng, Zhangpu, Hua'an, Changtai, Tong'an, Nanjing, Longyan, Pinghe, Zhao'an, Yunxiao, and Zhangping, as well as more than 30 important towns around Xiamen, such as Jimei, Songyu, Jiaomei, and Liuwudian, eliminating more than 21,000 defending enemies, completely clearing out the remaining bandit strongholds in inland southern Fujian. Xiamen was exposed to the iron fist of the People's Liberation Army. At 21:00 on the 15th, under the cover of hundreds of artillery pieces, the People's Liberation Army crossed the wide sea surface with multiple assault spearheads, bravely landed on Xiamen Island, and after 40 hours of fighting, by 11:00 on the 17th, Xiamen Island, a military strategic location on the southeastern coast of Fujian, was liberated, eliminating more than 27,000 of Tang Enbo's troops and achieving another great victory after the Fuzhou campaign. Thus, with the exception of the two isolated islands of Dongshan and Kinmen in southeastern Fujian, all 65 county towns in Fujian Province, covering approximately 120,000 square kilometers of land and a population of more than 14 million, were liberated.
