    Section One: The Task and Significance of Political Economy
    Bogdanov's viewpoint and method are obviously wrong. He abandons and abstracts the economic characteristics of various stages of social development. He can only extract some common parts between different economies of different eras. Therefore, he cannot understand the particularity and difference between the fundamentally different economies of various eras in history. Thus, people can equally equate the capitalist economy with various essentially different economies before and after capitalism, and cannot distinguish their different characteristics and differences. Therefore, it is impossible to divide any "clear dividing line," and it can be considered that "there are no drastic changes." This is completely the same as the bourgeoisie and their spokespersons, the bourgeois economists, who regard the capitalist economy as an eternal and unchanging view. We believe that the important thing in studying and analyzing various socio-economic phenomena is to discover and distinguish the particularities of various economies, the differences between various economies, and their specific laws. The bourgeoisie and bourgeois political economists oppose socialism and Marxism-Leninism, saying that socialist production is not the same as capitalist production in that it uses machines, tools, raw materials, and labor to produce. Therefore, socialist production is the same as capitalist production, there is no difference, so there is no socialist society, so capitalism can shout long live. Indeed, socialist production also requires the same production means such as labor, machines, and raw materials, and they are indispensable. But the essence of the problem does not lie in these places, but in who controls the production means such as machines and raw materials, that is, which class controls them, and how to use them, and who do they serve, that is, which class do they serve? At the same time, we must look at the position of the laborers (the owners of labor) in production, that is, how are the laborers combined with the means of production? That is to say, do we look at whether the laborers are the owners of the means of production, or are they the enslaved people without the means of production, and how are they enslaved? That is to say, we must see who the laborers are producing for, whether they are producing for themselves, or for capitalists, feudal lords, or slave owners? These are the questions of the mode of production in history, and also the questions of the relations of production in history, which are the "dividing line" questions of dividing eras, and we must pay attention to them.
    Political Economy in the Narrow Sense
    Political economy in the narrow sense is a science created by Marx, specializing in the economy of capitalist society as the object of study. Marx grew up in capitalist society. After the classical bourgeois political economists established bourgeois political economy, he represented the proletariat and established the proletariat's political economy. He analyzed and criticized the economy of capitalist society, grasped the laws of economic movement in capitalist society, and put forward the task of the proletarian socialist revolution. Engels gave a brief introduction to Marx's arduous achievements in building political economy in Anti-Dühring; he said:
    "Until now, what economic science has given us is almost entirely limited to the occurrence and development of the capitalist mode of production. It begins with criticizing the remnants of the feudal mode of production and exchange, proving the inevitability of these remnants being replaced by the capitalist mode. Then, it positively expounds the positive aspects of the capitalist mode of production and the corresponding laws of the exchange mode, which means that they can still promote the general social purpose. Finally, it concludes with a socialist critique of the capitalist mode of production from a socialist point of view. This is to draw conclusions from the above-mentioned narrative of the negative aspects of the laws, proving that this mode of production is moving towards a place where it can no longer exist due to its own development. This critique proves that the capitalist mode of production and exchange have become increasingly unbearable fetters for production itself. It also proves that the mode of distribution, which necessarily takes this mode of production and exchange as a condition, creates increasingly unbearable class conditions day by day, creating increasingly sharp opposition, namely: on the one hand, a small number of but increasingly wealthy capitalists, and on the other hand, a large number of proletarian wage laborers whose status is generally deteriorating. Finally, it is further proved that the capitalist mode of production can no longer control the enormous productive forces created within the scope of the capitalist mode of production itself. These productive forces are waiting to be transferred to the control of a society organized for planned common work, and want to guarantee all members of society the means to continuously increase their means of livelihood and the free development of their abilities.

    第一节　政治经济学的任务与意义
    波格达诺夫的这种观点方法显然是错误的。他把社会发展各阶段各种不同的经济底特点，都给舍弃抽象去了。只能抽出一些各时代各种不同的经济间的共同部分，因此，它是根本不能了解历史上各时代各种根本不同性质经济间的特殊性与差别性的，从而人们也就可以把资本主义的经济与资本主义以前和它以后的本质上根本不同的各种经济都同样地等量齐观，区别不出它们的不同的特点与差别性来，因此也就无法划分出什么“明确的分界线”来，也就可以认为“没有什么急激的变化”了。这是与资产阶级和他们的代言人——资产阶级经济学者，把资本主义经济看做永恒不变的观点，完全同出一辙。我们认为研究分析各种社会经济现象，重要的是在于发现与区别各种经济的特殊性，各种经济问的差别性和它们的特殊规律。资产阶级和资产阶级政治经济学者们反对社会主义，反对马列主义说：什么社会主义的生产，还不是与资本主义的生产一样地要使用机器、使用工具、使用原料和使用劳动力来进行生产，因此社会主义的生产就与资本主义的生产是相同的，是没有什么区别的，因此也就没有什么社会主义社会的存在，因此资本主义便可以高呼万岁。确实，社会主义的生产，劳动力、机器原料等生产手段，也都是同样地需要的，并且是不可缺少的，但是问题的本质却不在这些地方，而在于机器原料等生产手段为谁所掌握，即被什么阶级所掌握，并且怎样去使用它们，使用它们又是为谁服务，即为什么阶级服务？同时，我们又要看劳动者（劳动力的所有者）在生产中又是处于什么样的地位，即劳动者与生产手段是怎样结合的？这也就是要我们看劳动者是生产手段的所有者呢？还是没有生产手段的被奴役者呢，并且是怎样地被奴役着的？这也就是说要看劳动者是为谁生产着的，是为自己生产呢，还是为资本家、为封建主、为奴隶主生产着的呢？这些就是历史上的生产方式的问题，也是历史上的生产关系的问题，也就是划分时代的“分界线”问题，我们必须注意的。
    狭义的政治经济学
    狭义的政治经济学，是马克思创建起来，专门以资本主义社会的经济为研究对象的科学。马克思生长在资本主义社会里，他在古典派资产阶级政治经济学者建立了资产阶级政治经济学以后，代表无产阶级建立了无产阶级的政治经济学，他分析批判了资本主义社会的经济，掌握了资本主义社会经济运动的规律，并提出了无产阶级社会主义革命的任务。关于马克思艰辛缔建政治经济学的功绩。恩格斯在反杜林论中，曾有扼要的介绍；他说：
    “截至现在，经济科学所给与我们的，几乎完全限于资本主义生产方式的发生和发展，它开始于批判封建生产形态及交换形态底残余，证明这些残余为资本主义形态所代替的必然性。然后，它从正面阐发资本主义生产方式及与之相适应的交换形态诸规律底积极方面，这积极的方面就是说它们还能促进一般的社会目的意思。最后，它以社会主义观点，对资本主义的生产方式予以社会主义的批判，作为结论。这就是从以上诸规律的消极的方面的叙述，得出结论，证明这种生产方式，由于其自身的发展正在向着使它自身不复能再行存在下去的地点迈进着。这个批判，证明出：资本主义的生产形态及交换形态，对于生产本身益发成为不能忍受的桎梏。又证明出：必然以这种生产形态和交换形态作为条件的分配方式，一天一天地造出益发不能忍受的阶级状态，造成日益尖锐的对立，即：一方面是为数日少但却益发富足的资本家，另一方面则是为数日众，而他们的地位一般说来却是日益恶化着的无产的工资劳动者的对立。最后更证明出：资本主义的生产方式，业已再也不能控制资本主义生产方式本身范围内部所造成的庞大生产力，这些生产力，正专在等候着把自己转入于为一个有计划的共同工作而组织起来的社会掌握中，并欲对全体社会成员保证其生活资料及其能力自由发展的手段，能得以不断地增长。
