【Beijing News】Industrial and commercial representatives attending the Second Beijing People's Representatives Conference have expressed their views on the resolutions passed by the conference, including the suggestion to the central government to issue public bonds and the proposals on financial taxation and relief for unemployed workers. The following is a summary:

Regarding the resolution to issue public bonds to stabilize prices: Tang Qingyong, representative of the People's Livelihood Construction Association Beijing Branch and manager of Shanghai Bank's Beijing branch, who originally proposed the motion, said: "In order to balance national revenue and expenditure, in addition to issuing banknotes, the next best method is to issue public bonds. This is a legitimate method because issuing public bonds can absorb idle funds and also suppress prices. However, the issuance of public bonds must be based on the principle of voluntary subscription. It is hoped that the relevant government authorities can study this in detail. In addition to paying attention to publicity and establishing credit, the calculation method may refer to real unit calculation, and the term should be short. This is a legitimate investment opportunity for the industrial and commercial sectors." Wang Biao, deputy manager of the Continental Bank and the original proposer, as well as Han Songshang, manager of the Salt Industry Bank, Fu Huating, chairman of the preparatory committee of the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce, Wang Xiangchen, member of the Standing Committee, Sui Jingren, manager of the Industrial Zhi Xing Society, Zhang Xianting, manager of Lihua Soy Sauce Company, and Han Qinglin, representative of the cooperative, all believe that: issuing public bonds can absorb idle funds, stabilize prices, and assist government finances. It is necessary to issue them now. We should publicize them widely and assist the government in completing this task.

Regarding the resolution on severely punishing unscrupulous merchants and stabilizing prices, the industrial and commercial representatives unanimously supported it. Han Songshang, manager of the Salt Industry Bank, said: "Beijing has been liberated for nine months, and a few unscrupulous merchants have not been able to change their thinking. They still only care about personal interests and disregard the people's lives. The government should severely punish them according to the law." Tang Qingyong, manager of the Shanghai Bank's Beijing branch, said: "Unscrupulous merchants harm the people's lives. The people should report them and ask the government to bring them to justice, so that unscrupulous merchants will disappear."

Regarding the resolution on providing relief to unemployed workers, the industrial and commercial representatives unanimously agreed that it was appropriate and necessary. Gao Zhende, supervisor of the Jingxi Coal Mine Company, said: "This not only guarantees the lives of workers but also helps develop production. After implementation, workers can concentrate on learning and working, and the factory can also reasonably improve its operations. The workers on the job are also greatly encouraged and can reduce their worries. Based on the experience of the Jingxi Coal Mine Company, the leadership should actively try to organize production and use expanded production to place workers. All factories should implement this resolution with a positive spirit and should not passively reduce production because of this resolution." Fu Huating, chairman of the preparatory committee of the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce, Wang Xiangzhen, member of the Standing Committee, Zhang Xianting, manager of Lihua Soy Sauce Company, Zheng Qidong, chairman of the preparatory committee of the Soap Industry Association, Han Songshang, manager of the Salt Industry Bank, Tang Qingyong, manager of the Shanghai Bank's Beijing branch, and Wang Biao, deputy manager of the Continental Bank, all hoped that this resolution would be quickly and widely promoted in public and private industrial and commercial enterprises. Han Qinglin, representative of the cooperative, said: "With this method, workers will definitely be able to increase their work efficiency."

Regarding tax issues: Jia Xingwu, manager of the Beijing branch of the People's Bank of China, said: "The tax proposals submitted by the municipal government are fair and reasonable, and the provision to reduce the burden on farmers is even more correct, so it has won the enthusiastic support of the people." Hu Yuan, director of the Beijing Machine Factory, said: "State-owned factories and enterprises paying taxes to the municipal government is not only fulfilling a certain obligation to the municipal government but also can strengthen the operation and management of factories and have a positive stimulating effect." Fu Huating, chairman of the preparatory committee of the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce, said: "The construction of the new capital requires funds everywhere. In the total expenditure of the municipal government, business expenses account for 41 percent of the total in the second half of this year, and business expenses account for more than 50 percent in the next year. These are all used to improve environmental sanitation and carry out various constructions. The people should, of course, bear the expenses for building their own city." Wang Xiangzhen, member of the Standing Committee of the preparatory committee of the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce, said: "The tax collection methods are extremely fair and reasonable, such as industrial tax being lower than commercial tax; the tax rate of industrial tax varies according to the needs of the national economy and the people's livelihood; and the implementation of progressive property tax. We in the industrial and commercial sectors strongly support such regulations and will definitely and conscientiously abide by them."

　　京各界人民代表会议决议
  　工商界代表一致表示拥护
    【北京讯】出席北京市第二届各界人民代表会议的工商界代表，纷纷对本届会议所通过的向中央建议发行公债及财政税收案与救济失业员工等决议，发表谈话，摘要如下：
    关于发行公债以稳定物价的决议：原提案人民主建国会北京分会代表、上海银行北京分行经理唐庆永说：为使国家收支平衡，除发行钞票外，其次为发公债，这是正当的方法，因为发行公债可以吸收游资，还可以抑平物价。但发行公债必须以自由认购为原则，希望政府各主管机关能够详加研究，除注意宣传及建立债信外，计算方法似可照折实单位计算，期限宜短，这是工商界正当投资的机会。原提案人大陆银行副经理汪镳、及工商界代表盐业银行经理韩诵裳、市工商业联合会筹备会主任委员傅华亭、常委王向辰、工业知行社经理隋经仁、利华酱油公司经理张献庭、合作社代表韩庆霖等认为：发行公债，可以吸收游资，稳定物价，协助政府财政，现在发行是必要的，应广泛宣传，协助政府完成这项工作。
    关于严惩奸商、稳定物价的决议，工商界代表一致拥护。盐业银行经理韩诵裳说：北京解放已九个月，少数奸商尚不能改变思想，仍然只顾个人利益，不顾人民生活，应请政府依法严惩。上海银行北京分行经理唐庆永说：奸商危害人民生活，人民应该检举他们，请政府法办。务使奸商绝迹。
    关于救济失业员工的决议，工商界代表一致认为是妥善和必要的。京西煤矿公司监委高振德说：这样不只保障了工人生活，而且能帮助发展生产。实施后，工人可安心学习和工作，厂方也可合理地改善经营。在业工人也受到很大的鼓舞，可以减少顾虑。根据京西煤矿公司的经验，领导上应积极设法组织生产，用扩大生产来安插工人。各厂坊应积极精神执行此项决议，不应该因为有了这项决议，就消极的缩小生产。市工商联合会筹备会主任委员傅华亭、常委王向震、利华酱油公司经理张献庭、造胰业同业公会筹委会主任郑启栋、盐业银行经理韩诵裳、上海银行北京分行经理唐庆永和大陆银行副经理汪镳都希望把这项决议，赶快普遍推行到公私营工商业方面去。合作社代表韩庆霖说：有了这个办法，工人一定可以增加工作效率。
    关于税收问题：中国人民银行北京分行经理贾星五说：市府所提税收议案，公平合理，其中规定减轻农民负担，更极正确，所以深得人民的热烈拥护。北京机器厂厂长胡元说：国营工厂企业向市政府缴税，不只是向市政府尽了一定的义务，而且可使工厂加强经营管理，有积极的刺激作用。市工商联合会筹备会主任委员傅华亭说：建设新首都在在需款。市府总支出中，本年下半年事业费占总额百分之四十一，明年事业费占百分之五十以上，这都用于改善环境卫生及进行种种修建。人民建设自己的城市当然应由人民自己负担经费。市工商联合会筹备会常委王向震说：税收的办法极为公平合理，如工业税轻于商业税；工业税税率中根据国计民生需要程度而有轻有重；财产税实行累进等这样的规定，我们工商界非常拥护，绝对认真遵行。
