　　Winter Schools Open in Shijiazhuang Suburbs and Other Areas

[This newspaper report] Winter schools in various areas have started classes one after another, and the masses have shown extremely high enthusiasm for learning. In the suburban area of Shijiazhuang City, Hebei Province, after several days of publicity and mobilization, in Zhao Ling Village alone, 351 men and 431 women enrolled in school on the 6th and 7th. Since its opening on the 20th of last month, the youth night school in Zhentou Village, District 7, has seen students voluntarily elect class leaders and group leaders, establish a public agreement, and purchase textbooks. They said, "This winter, we would rather not buy new cotton clothes than not buy books." Currently, 58 of the 64 students in the school's elementary class have bought books. People who previously did not even know their own names have generally learned fifty or sixty practical characters and decimal addition and subtraction in nearly a month. More than fifty other people in the village have successively requested to enroll in the school, but have not been able to do so due to funding and teacher limitations. Literacy classes in Lishu, Zhangwu, Kangping, and Tai'an Counties in Liaoxi Province began in early October one after another. The teaching content is closely integrated with the current central work. For example, recently when delivering public grain, the literacy class in Zhiqian Village, District 7 of Lishu County, taught "Delivering public grain to support the front lines and liberate all of China"; the women performed the play "Delivering Public Grain" and performed it for everyone at mass meetings, which played a great role. In Luxi Township, Fangzi City, Shandong Province, twelve villages have started winter schools, with more than 500 students participating. They have formed children's literacy classes, women's literacy classes, youth night schools, children's morning, noon, and night schools, and reading groups. The study courses and study time are all jointly discussed and formulated by the students according to the situation, which is deeply supported by the masses.

　　石家庄郊区等地冬学开课
    【本报讯】各地冬学已陆续开始上课，群众学习热情极高。河北石家庄市郊区经过几日的宣传动员，只赵陵村一村，六、七两日内，就有三百五十一个男人，四百三十一个女人报名入学。七区振头村的青年夜校自上月二十日开学后，学员自动选出班长、组长，订出公约，购买课本，他们说：“今冬宁可不穿新棉衣也要买书。”现该校初级班六十四个学员，有五十八人买了书。从前连自己姓名都不认识的人，在将近一个月中，一般的都学会了五、六十个应用字和十进位的加减法。该村陆续要求报名入校的还有五十余人，但因经费及教师限制，尚未能入学。辽西省梨树、彰武、康平、台安等县的识字班，十月初旬已先后开学，教学内容并与当前中心工作紧密结合起来。如最近送交公粮时，梨树七区支前村识字班就教“送公粮为了支援前线，解放全中国”；妇女们就排演“送公粮”剧，在开群众大会时演给大伙儿看，起了很大的作用。山东坊子市路西乡，有十二个村都办起了冬学，参加学员五百余人，组成了儿童识字班、妇女识字班、青年夜校、儿童早学、午学、夜学、读报组等，学习课目和学习时间，都由学员根据情况共同讨论制订，深为群众所拥护。
