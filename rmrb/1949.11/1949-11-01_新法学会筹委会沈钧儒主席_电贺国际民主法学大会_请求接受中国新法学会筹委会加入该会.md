　　New Legal Studies Society Preparatory Committee Chairman Shen Junru
  　Sends Telegram of Congratulations to the International Association of Democratic Lawyers
    Requesting Acceptance of the Preparatory Committee of the Chinese New Legal Studies Society into the Association
    [Report from this newspaper] The International Association of Democratic Lawyers is organized by progressive legal scholars from various countries, with members including legal scholars and legal organizations from more than thirty countries. The conference was founded in Paris in 1946, and since then an international conference has been held annually, with the aim of uniting progressive legal scholars to fight for the protection of human rights, and in defense of peace and democracy. The Fourth International Congress was held in Rome from October 28th to 31st this year. Recently, the General Secretary of the association, Noel, sent a telegram from Rome to the Preparatory Committee of the Chinese New Legal Studies Society, inviting the association to send representatives to Rome to participate in the meeting. Due to the short notice, it was not possible to send representatives to attend, so Shen Junru, Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Chinese New Legal Studies Society, sent a telegram to the conference to congratulate it and request to join the International Association of Democratic Lawyers as a member. The telegram reads as follows:
    To Mr. Noel, General Secretary of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers in Rome, and to the representatives of the Fourth Congress of your Association:
    On behalf of the Preparatory Committee of the Chinese New Legal Studies Society, organized by representatives of democratic legal scholars from all over China, I extend my warmest congratulations to the Fourth Congress of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers, and wish your association greater success in the lofty struggle to strive for lasting world peace, protect the democratic rights of the people, and fight for the independence and freedom of oppressed nations with the weapon of democratic jurisprudence. At the same time, I sincerely request the Fourth Congress of your Association to approve the decision to accept the Preparatory Committee of the Chinese New Legal Studies Society as a member of your Association!
　　Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Chinese New Legal Studies Society, Shen Junru
　　October 25th, Beijing
