　　Reading "Collection of Soviet Literary Theories"
    ——Published by the Fifties Publishing House
    Jin Yu
    Translated by Huang Wu
    This is a newly published book. It includes nine articles, four on pure theory, four on writer monographs, and the last one is "Shakespeare in Russia." For those who crave Soviet literary theory and care about the development of Soviet literature since World War II, this is a good reference book, and the translation is also fluent.
    Soviet literature, from the October Revolution to the victory of the last war, shone brightly on the entire world literary scene, unsurpassed by any other country. This great achievement in literature is inseparable from the victory of socialism in the Soviet Union. In Soviet literature, we see the people's love for their motherland. And in terms of literature itself, it has also exerted its great social significance. As Gorky said: "Russian literature, in its democracy, in its efforts to solve the tasks of social existence, in its advocacy of human ideals, in its singing of freedom, in its profound interest in the lives of the people, in its constant pursuit of universal and constantly renewed truth, is powerful."
    Precisely because Soviet literature has this consistent tendency to defend peace, democracy, sing of freedom, and pursue truth, it has aroused dissatisfaction among Western bourgeois critics. In their view, Soviet literature is "too consistent in its opinions on social issues" and pays too much attention to "official needs." Therefore, in their eyes, Soviet literature is not free, not independent, and lacks artistic expression. In this way, Soviet literature presents two problems to bourgeois critics: the problem of tendency and the problem of beauty.
    The problem of tendency is not only the fundamental problem of Soviet literature, but also the main content of general literature. Belinsky said it well: "Art without reasonable historical significance can only satisfy the literary tastes of those who are out of date. In our time, the creation of the greatest skills, if it is limited to creating bird songs, limited to building a world that is disconnected from historical and philosophical reality, can only provide temporary pleasure. If art imagines that its palace is floating in the clouds, if it despises the earth, if it does not allow the sorrows and longings of mankind to disturb its mysterious dreams and poetic meditations, then it will not be passed down for a long time. Birds sing because they are born to sing. It does not react to the sadness of its kind, nor does it react to their joy. But if the inspiration of human beings, who are the soul of all things, is like that of birds, they are happy only because they can sing, how embarrassing is that?" Tolstoy also said: "A person should only start writing when the idea he wants to express becomes so strong that he cannot feel at ease without writing it down properly." This all means that any literary work cannot be without a solemn content. Soviet literature inherited the tradition of Tolstoy and others, the proper tradition of world literature, and developed it a step further. Avdoyev in his article "On Literary Tendency" spared no effort to quote extensively to prove that the origins of Soviet literature are long and not isolated. From this we can assert that with the development of the revolutionary situation, Soviet literature will be the general goal that the progressive literature of all nations strives to achieve.
    Those who oppose tendency in literature undoubtedly emphasize the problem of beauty. What attitude do Soviet writers hold towards the form and expression of beauty? Amazhov said: Russian literature has been following the path designated by its great critics, and its goal has always been the unity of profound content and beautiful form. Belinsky said: "Beauty is a necessary condition of art, without beauty, there will be no art, nor can there be any art." Gorky also said in 1919 that art is filled with "a desire, which everyone feels for something... but which literature or thought cannot capture. It is something mysterious, we give it a pale name called beauty: and it grows in the world and in our hearts, becoming more and more brilliant." Western critics believe that Soviet literature only emphasizes tendency and relegates the form and expression of beauty to an insignificant position, which is undoubtedly completely wrong.
    Gorky is a master of modern Soviet literature and a mentor of literary theory. In the article "Gorky's Aesthetics," we can see the rich content of Gorky's aesthetics: his theory would not be so brilliant if it were not based on Marxism-Leninism.
    In my opinion, the most distinctive feature of this book is the four monographs in the back that comment on Fadeyev, Grossman, Panfilov, and Sholokhov. The life experiences of these writers are as extraordinary as the protagonists in their novels. Whether in peaceful construction or in the war against Germany, they fought heroically.
    The last article is "Shakespeare in Russia," as the translator said, placing it at the end of the book is to introduce us to how the Soviet Union values ​​the legacy of world classical literature.
    Gorky said: "In European literature, the birth of our literature is a major event. To say that Western literature has never grown so powerfully, so quickly, and in such great brilliance." After reading this book, we feel even more that we should learn from the great Soviet literature.

　　读“苏联文艺论集”
    ——五十年代出版社出版
    今宇
    荒芜译
    这是一本出版不久的新书。里面包括九篇文章，关于纯理论者四篇，作家专论者四篇，最后一篇是“莎士比亚在俄国”。对于渴求苏联文艺理论，关心第二次世界大战以来苏联文学发展的人来说，这是本良好的参考书，译笔也很畅达。
    苏联文学，从十月革命到这次大战胜利结束，光辉烂灿地照耀了整个世界文坛，是没有那个国家能比得上的。这个文学上的伟大成就，是和苏联的社会主义的胜利分不开的。在苏联文学中，我们看出了人民对祖国的热爱。而就文学本身来说，它也发挥了它的巨大的社会意义。正如高尔基所说：“俄国文学，在它的民主上，在它尽力去解决社会存在的任务上，在人类理想的宣扬上，在自由的歌唱上，在它对于人民生活之深厚的兴趣上，在经常追求普遍的，不断更新的真理上，是强有力地。”
    正因为苏联文学有这种为保卫和平、民主，歌唱自由，追求真理的一致倾向，引起了西方资产阶级批评家的不满。在他们看来，苏联文学在“对社会问题上意见太一致了”，太顾及“官方需要”了。因此，他们眼中的苏联文学是不自由的，不独立的，缺乏艺术表现的。这样，苏联文学在资产阶级批评家之前便现出了两个问题，倾向性问题与美的问题。
    倾向性问题不独是苏联文学的根本问题，也是一般文学的主要内容。柏林斯基说得好：“没有合理的历史意义的内容的艺术，只能满足文学上过了时的人们。在我们的时代里，最伟大技巧的创造，如果它只限于创造鸟语，只限于架设一个与历史和哲理现实脱节的世界，也只能提供暂时的愉快。如果艺术妄想它的宫殿是浮在云端，如果它蔑视大地，如果它不让人类的忧患和渴望来打扰它的神秘的梦和诗的默想，那么它就不会传之久远。鸟儿唱歌是因为它生来就唱歌的。它既不反应同类的悲哀，亦不反应它们的快乐。可是如果身为万物之灵的人们，他们的灵感竟和鸟儿一样，他们快乐，只因为能唱歌，那是多么令人难堪呢。”托尔斯泰也说过：“一个人只有在他所要表现的思想变得如此地顽强，以致不把它好好写下来，就不能安心的时候，才应该动笔去写。”这都是说：任何文学作品都不能没有个庄严的内容。苏联文学是继承了托尔斯泰等人的传统，世界文学的正当传统，更向前发展了一步。阿坞卓夫在“论文学倾向性”这篇文章里不惜旁征博引来证明苏联文学之源远流长，不是孤立发展的。由此我们可以断言：随着革命形势的发展，苏联文学将是世界各民族进步文学所努力以赴的总目标。
    反对文学中倾向性的人，无疑问的，是强调美的问题的。苏联作家对于美的形式与表现抱着什么态度呢？阿玛卓夫说：俄国文学一直在遵循着它的伟大的批评家们所指定的道路前进，它的目标一贯是深刻的内容，和美丽的形式的统一。柏林斯基就说过：“美是艺术的必要条件，没有美，就不会有，也不能有任何艺术。”高尔基在一九一九年也说过，艺术充满了“一种欲求，就是大家对某种东西所感到的……而是文学或思想所捕捉不到的。那是某种神秘的东西，我们给它起了个苍白的名字叫做美：而且它滋长在世界上和我们的内心里，越来越光辉烂灿”。西方批评家们，认为苏联文学只强调倾向性，而把美的形式和表现贬黜到不足轻重的地位，无疑是完全错误的。
    高尔基是现代苏联文学的巨匠，也是文艺理论的导师。在“高尔基的美学”这一篇文章里，我们可以见到高尔基的美学的丰富内容：他的理论若不是以马列主义为基础，是不会这样光辉烂灿的。
    我认为：本书最有特色的，是后面评论法捷耶夫，格罗斯曼，潘菲洛夫，萧洛霍夫的四篇专论。这几位作家的平生经历也如小说里主人公一样是不平凡的，无论在和平建设中，在对德战争中，都英勇地战斗过。
    最末一篇是“莎士比亚在俄国”，正如译者所说，排在书末是介绍我们认识苏联如何重视世界古典文学遗产。
    高尔基说过：“在欧洲文学上，我们的文学之诞生是件大事，要说西方的文学，就没有象这样有力地，这么迅速地，在这样伟大的烂灿才华中生长起来过。”看了这本书，我们更感到我们应该向伟大的苏联文学学习。
