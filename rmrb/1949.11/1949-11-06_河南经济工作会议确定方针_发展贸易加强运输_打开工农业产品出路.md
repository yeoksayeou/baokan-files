　　The Henan Economic Work Conference Determines Policy
  　Develop Trade, Strengthen Transportation
    Open Up Outlets for Industrial and Agricultural Products
    [Reported by This Newspaper] The Henan Provincial Department of Industry and Commerce held a provincial economic work conference from October 11th to 25th to discuss the economic work policy and specific steps for Henan Province in the coming winter and spring.
    The conference first reviewed the implementation of the situation since the first economic conference in May this year, and considered that the policy of communicating foreign trade and domestic material exchange determined by the first economic conference was correct. Since May, trade relations have been established with North China, Northeast China, East China and other places. A large number of Henan specialties (cotton, oil, medicinal materials, fur, etc.) were exported to Tianjin, Shanghai and other places. From May to August, the four cities of Zhengzhou, Kaifeng, Xuchang, and Luohe had an output of 4,800,380 tons and an input of 5,665,352 tons. In addition, general agricultural products were also exported in large quantities. The relationship between urban and rural areas has also undergone significant changes. Exchanges between urban and rural areas have begun to recover. For example, from May to August, Kaifeng City imported 667,480 kilograms of cotton from rural areas, 14,746 kilograms of pigments, and 9,511,588 kilograms of edible salt. Due to the correct industrial and commercial policies, the concerns of capitalists have gradually been reduced, and they have begun to operate boldly. According to incomplete statistics, the industry and commerce in the five cities of Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, Xuchang, Zhuji, and Luoyang increased by more than 2,200 households from May to August, and peddlers have also generally decreased or changed careers. Some industries have also signed collective contracts, and labor-capital relations are relatively coordinated, and production enthusiasm has been improved. In terms of taxation, the summer business tax has been appropriately reduced. In terms of administrative management, markets have been opened up, peddlers have been concentrated, speculators have been cracked down, and business licenses have been issued. However, there are still left-right swaying deviations in the implementation of policies: one is the "left" emotion that overly favors the interests of workers, and the other is the right-leaning tendency to maintain capitalists. Some cadres are blindly tolerant of some lawless capitalists. These deviations should be overcome in the future.
    Based on this situation, the conference determined the work policy for this winter and next spring. It was decided to further develop and restore trade, strengthen transportation, communicate the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, and open up roads for industrial and agricultural production. In cities, state-owned trade should absorb large quantities of tobacco, cotton, grain, oilseeds, bristles, sulfur, guarantee a certain difference between grain and edible salt, and assist supply and marketing cooperatives to continue to open up sales channels for local products to ensure smooth flow of goods. Secondly, in rural areas, it is necessary to guide sideline production based on sales channels, organize transportation, and vigorously promote the masses to plant specialties such as tobacco and cotton.

　　河南经济工作会议确定方针
  　发展贸易加强运输
    打开工农业产品出路
    【本报讯】河南省工商厅于十月十一日至二十五日举行全省经济工作会议，讨论今冬明春河南全省的经济工作方针与具体步骤。
    会议首先检查了今年五月第一次经济会议以来的实施情形，认为第一次经济会议确定沟通对外贸易及内地物资交流的方针是正确的。从五月以后，先后与华北、东北、华东等地开始建立了贸易关系，河南特产（棉花、油类、药材、皮毛等）大批输往天津、上海等地。郑、汴、许、漯四市从五月至八月四个月内，输出量达四百八十万零三百八十吨，输入量达五百六十六万五千三百五十二吨。另外，一般的农产品也大批的输出。城乡关系也随着起了显著变化，城乡往来开始恢复，如开封市五月至八月四个月由乡村输入的棉花即达六十六万七千四百八十斤，输往乡村颜料一万四千七百四十六斤，食盐九百五十一万一千五百八十八斤。由于工商政策的端正，资本家顾虑逐渐减除，开始大胆营业。据不完全统计，仅汴、郑、许、朱集、洛阳五个市工商业从五月至八月增加二千二百余户，摊贩也普遍的减少或转业。有的行业更订立了集体合同，劳资关系比较协调，生产情绪提高。在税收方面，适当的减轻了夏季营业税。行政管理上，开辟市场，集中摊贩，打击了投机分子，颁发了营业证。但在执行政策上还存在着左右摇摆的偏向：一种是过高的偏重了工人利益的“左”的情绪，一种是偏重维护资本家的右的倾向。部分干部存在着盲目性，对某些不守法的资本家过于迁就，这些偏向今后应加克服。
    会议根据这种情况，确定了今冬明春的工作方针。决定进一步开展与恢复贸易，加强运输工作，沟通城乡物资交流，给工业农业生产打开道路。在城市中，公营贸易要大量吸收烟、棉、粮、油料、猪鬃、硫磺、保证与粮食食盐一定差额，并协助供销合作社，继续打开土产销路，使货畅其流。其次在乡村中，要依据销路进行指导副业生产，组织运输，大力提倡群众种植烟、棉等特产。
