    Hebei Non-Disaster Areas Achieve Bumper Harvest
    Grain Enters Storage, Wheat is Sown
    Mutual Aid Organizations Play a Guaranteeing Role
    [This newspaper reports] After the non-disaster areas of Hebei Province achieved a bumper harvest this year, coinciding with the joyous celebration of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the enthusiasm of the farmers is exceptionally high. During the autumn harvest and wheat planting, although there was a lack of manpower, every household actively rushed to harvest and sow, and organized mutual aid groups based on the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit. Statistics from six villages in Anguo alone show that there were 130 mutual aid groups and 28 women's mutual aid groups. In Yan Village, 48 mutual aid groups were organized, with 50 percent of the village population participating, guaranteeing the smooth progress of the autumn harvest and wheat planting. After intense labor, the abundant grain has been stored, and wheat planting has been completed.

    河北非灾区丰收后
    粮食入仓麦田下种
    组织互助起了保证作用
    【本报讯】河北省非灾区今年获得丰收后，又逢喜庆中华人民共和国成立，农民情绪异常高涨。在秋收种麦中，虽然缺乏人力，但家家户户均积极突击收种，并在自愿两利的原则下，组织了互助组。仅安国六个村的统计，就有互助组一百三十个，妇女互助组二十八个。阎村组织了四十八个互助组全村百分之五十的人都组织起来，保证了秋收种麦的顺利进行。经过了紧张的劳作，肥实的粮食已经入仓，麦田也已完成播种。
