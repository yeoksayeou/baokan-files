Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 29th: As the People's Liberation Army advances on the lairs of the Guomindang Gui clique bandit gangs in Guangxi, and liberates three of the province's four major cities – Guilin, Wuzhou, and Liuzhou – the remnant bandit Bai Chongxi, entrenched in Nanning in southwestern Guangxi, is attempting to collude with the French imperialist colonial authorities in Vietnam and their puppet Bao Dai to continue a desperate struggle against the Chinese people. According to a United Press report from Hong Kong on the 21st, bandit Bai Chongxi has requested the assistance of the French colonial authorities in Vietnam and Bao Dai to establish a so-called "anti-communist resistance core" on the Guangxi-Vietnam border. The report also claims that Bao Dai's puppet regime has agreed to this conspiracy. The conspiracy of the Gui clique bandit gang to collude with the French colonial authorities has been underway for some time. When the People's Liberation Army annihilated four divisions of Bai Chongxi's bandit forces in mid-October, and the remnant Gui clique bandits fled to Nanning, American and British news agencies revealed that the French authorities in Vietnam had been in contact with the Guomindang bandit gangs. According to a United Press report from Hong Kong on October 22nd: "Reliable sources here say that the Chinese Guomindang government and the French Vietnamese government are discussing the establishment of a buffer zone to resist the Chinese Communist army."

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 29th: Guomindang Gui clique ringleader Li Zongren fled from Nanning to Hong Kong on the 20th of this month. In Hong Kong, bandit Li has been frequently consorting with various agents of American imperialism, begging for assistance in his desperate straits. On the 22nd, bandit Li met with Vice Admiral Baker, commander of the U.S. Seventh Special Fleet. On the 23rd, bandit Li also met with Mr. Shutes, the chargé d'affaires of the U.S. Embassy to the Guomindang bandit gang, who had arrived in Hong Kong from Chongqing. On the same day, bandit Li intended to meet with U.S. Treasury Secretary Snyder, who was visiting Hong Kong, to report on "the recent comprehensive developments in China," but was not received. On the 28th, bandit Li had a long talk with reactionary U.S. Senator Nolan for an hour. Nolan had flown from the Philippines to Taiwan on the 19th, and after flying to Chongqing with Colonel Wheeler, a representative of MacArthur, and others on the 25th to meet with the bandit Jiang, he flew to Hong Kong on the 28th. At the same time, Allen, chairman of the Appropriations Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives, and three committee members arrived in Hong Kong from Manila on the 28th and will meet with Nolan. An Associated Press dispatch on the 21st stated: "It is expected that Li will go to the United States as a go-between in an effort to obtain American aid."

    【新华社北京二十九日电】正当人民解放军进军国民党桂系匪帮老巢广西，并解放该省四大城市之三——桂林、梧州、柳州之际，逃踞桂西南南宁的残匪白崇禧企图与越南法国帝国主义殖民当局及其傀儡保大勾结，继续进行反对中国人民的垂死挣扎。据合众社香港二十一日电披露，白匪崇禧要求越南法国殖民当局及保大帮助在桂越边界建立所谓“反共抵抗核心”。该电并称，法国的傀儡保大当局已同意了这一项阴谋。桂系匪帮与法国殖民当局勾结的阴谋，前此很久即已进行。当十月中，人民解放军歼灭白崇禧匪部主力四个师，桂系残匪逃往南宁之时，美英通讯社即透露越南法国当局与国民党匪帮有所接触。据合众社香港十月二十二日电称：“此间可靠消息称：中国国民党政府与法属越南政府正在商谈关于成立一个缓冲地带以抵抗中国共产党军队的问题。”
    【新华社北京二十九日电】国民党桂系匪首李宗仁于本月二十日由南宁逃往香港。李匪在港频频与美国帝国主义的各种代理人进行勾搭，乞敢亡命中的援助。二十二日李匪与美第七特种舰队司令官贝克中将会晤。二十三日，李匪又与自渝抵港的驻国民党匪帮的美大使馆代办师曙安会晤。同日，李匪曾打算求见飞港访问的美财长斯奈德，向斯报告“最近中国全面发展的情势”，未获接见。二十八日，李匪与美反动参议员诺兰长谈一小时。诺兰系于十九日由菲飞台，二十五日偕麦克阿瑟代表惠勒上校等飞往重庆晤蒋贼后，二十八日飞抵香港。与此同时，美国众议院拨款委员会主席艾伦德及委员三人，于二十八日由马尼拉抵达香港，并将与诺兰会晤。美联社二十一日电称：“预料李将赴美作为努力获取美援之一经手人”。
