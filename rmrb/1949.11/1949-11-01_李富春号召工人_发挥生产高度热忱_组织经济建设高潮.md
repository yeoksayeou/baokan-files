　　Li Fuchun Calls on Workers
  　Unleash High Enthusiasm for Production
  　Organize a High Tide of Economic Construction
    In Comrade Li Fuchun's report, he profoundly analyzed the great significance of the record-breaking movement, pointing out that it is a central link in improving production, establishing an economic accounting system, and initiating a high tide of economic construction. First, he compared the record-breaking movement with past model worker movements and production competitions, pointing out that the latter only increased production at certain times and produced more goods, while the new record movement not only breaks old production standards, improves quality and quantity, and increases labor productivity, but also improves technology and labor methods, and further achieves quota management and cost accounting, and improves production and management systems. It not only overcomes waste in production, but also saves in production. This is a richer and more frequent comprehensive improvement of work. He said: If we can organize millions of workers, staff, and technicians, unleash their labor enthusiasm and initiative, and launch a record-breaking movement, the entire production landscape will be renewed. Chairman Mao called on us to organize a high tide of economic construction, and the record-breaking movement is the specific path to achieve this high tide. It is the starting point for organizing a high tide of economic construction!

　　李富春号召工人
  　发挥生产高度热忱
  　组织经济建设高潮
    在李富春同志的报告中，深刻的分析了创纪录运动的伟大意义，指出这是提高生产建立经济核算制，掀起一个经济建设高潮的中心一环。首先他比较了创纪录运动与过去的劳模运动、生产竞赛的不同，指出后者只是在一定时机下把生产提高，多出东西，而新纪录运动则不仅要打破旧的生产标准，提高质量与产量，不但要提高劳动率，特别还要改善技术与劳动方法，且要进一步达到定额管理与成本计算，并改善生产与管理制度，不但在生产中克服浪费，而且在生产中进行节约，这是更丰富更经常的全面工作的提高。他说：如果我们能够组织千百万工人、职员与技术人员，发挥他们的劳动热情与积极性，展开创纪录运动，则整个生产面貌将为之一新。毛主席号召我们组织一个经济建设的高潮，创纪录运动就是达到这一高潮的具体道路。就是组织经建高潮的起点！
