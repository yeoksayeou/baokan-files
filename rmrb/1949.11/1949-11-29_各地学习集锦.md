　　Learning Compendium from Various Locations

　　The Hebei Provincial Government Public Security Department, in studying the CPPCC documents, created a learning method of using typical reports to make up for the shortcomings of large reports. This involves identifying comrades in the study groups who are actively learning and can explain issues with simple reasoning, and having them answer questions that everyone urgently needs to understand at learning conferences.

　　The Hebei Military Region Directly Subordinate Units Study Committee convened a meeting of study group leaders from various branches on the 12th. At the meeting, Zhou Zhiyuan, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Political Department, summarized the learning methods: (1) Cadres in Group A, who are required to study theory, should read the CPPCC documents word by word, sentence by sentence, and article by article, with analysis and thought. The focus should be on the theoretical basis of the CPPCC Program and its connection to the practical problems of the Chinese revolution. Discussion meetings must raise questions, prepare carefully, refer to documents, and think deeply, correcting hastily organized, unprepared discussion meetings. (2) Cadres in Group A of each unit should, as much as possible, plan time to participate in the discussions of Groups B and C to help them study. When Group A discusses, Groups B and C can be invited to participate as observers. (3) Grasp the backbone to lead everyone. Comrades who are actively learning and have a relatively high level of theoretical and policy understanding can be systematically organized to speak within the group, allowing them to prepare systematically and lead everyone to go deeper. (4) Regarding nouns and terms, branch committees and sub-committees should answer them in a timely manner, without wasting too much time. (5) Leaders should promptly explain and educate on the issues raised in the study, so that the narrow and trivial problems of individuals do not hinder the study of the documents.

　　The Chahar Provincial and Zhangjiakou City Study Committee General Assembly convened a meeting of secretaries of general branches and branches on the 17th. After inspecting the learning of various units, everyone at the meeting believed that the various learning organizations should be further reorganized. Comrades who do not currently have the conditions to study theory should not be forced to study theory, in order to concentrate on learning culture or basic problems and policies of the Chinese revolution.

　　In Qingdao City, all government offices use central groups to lead the learning. In some government offices, the central group is jointly composed of chiefs and directors, etc., and the Party committee and general branch. The learning of the Tianjin Municipal Government is also carried out by a core group composed of cadres above the section chief level, who raise questions, formulate speaking outlines, and collect reference materials to展开 discuss, in order to help the entire government office learn.

　　Huadong University in Jinan uses weekend "Q&A sessions" to present the main content of the week's study, written on slips of paper. Using the entertainment methods of "bumping the ball" or "passing the flower while drumming," students are selected to grab a question and answer it. If they cannot answer, they are punished by singing or telling a story.

　　In the various county government offices of the Huangchuan Special District of Henan, publicity was carried out during the study of the CPPCC documents. Explanations were given to the masses through large and small gatherings, wall newspapers, and slogans. For workers, the focus was on leading the construction of the new China; for farmers, on suppressing bandits and eliminating local tyrants and land reform; and for the business community, on Chapter IV of the CPPCC Program. The masses were happy to listen, and at the same time, the learning enthusiasm of the cadres was also improved, because in order to explain to others, they themselves had to understand clearly first.
