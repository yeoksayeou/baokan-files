　　After Visiting the Changxindian Factory
    Zhang Ming
    I am a young student lacking in production knowledge, having never participated in labor since childhood; therefore, I also do not understand the greatness of the working people.
    After liberation, I studied the history of social development and the basic problems of the Chinese revolution, understood the principle that labor creates the world, and learned that the working class is the most organized, disciplined, and revolutionary leading class, the most resolute and thorough. At the same time, I often saw in the newspapers how workers in the areas awaiting liberation bravely fought against the Kuomintang reactionaries to protect assets, and how workers in the liberated areas, having raised their class consciousness, actively developed production. At this time, I began to realize in my mind the position and role of the workers. Moreover, several times when large meetings were held, workers participated with us, wearing brand new uniforms, singing various joyful and enthusiastic songs, therefore, my feelings towards the working class also became closer, and I even sometimes complained about why I hadn't been a worker before—how glorious and great it would be if I were a worker!
    At the end of last month, we had the opportunity to visit a factory. After entering the factory, I saw motors and machines arranged everywhere in the rooms, and the floor was not covered with carpets (I used to have this idea), but was piled with iron sand and various parts. Every worker comrade quietly guarded his work post, working with unwavering attention. A welding worker, wearing worn leather clothes and leather goggles, worked there nervously. The worker managing the steam hammer was conscientious and did not dare to be distracted at all. The worker cutting screws did not allow for even half a second of carelessness with the up and down motion of the machine. Thus, I had an indescribable feeling in my heart. This current life of the workers was not the infinitely mysterious and extremely tempting feeling that I had fantasized about whenever I passed by the factory before. Especially when I saw the steelmaking workers, each holding a large pair of tongs, standing on both sides of the machine, fiery red steel bars went in from this side and came out from that side, went in from that side and came out from this side, their hands continuously sending them back and forth, so tired that large beads of sweat dripped down their faces. I unconsciously said to the worker comrade who was guiding our tour, "Do they work like this all day?" That comrade looked at me, not knowing what the meaning of my question was, but excitedly replied, "Yes, they do this all day." Then he added, "The work is not too intense now, when there are many orders from outside, the work will be even more intense."
    Afterwards, we visited many other places. Everywhere there were motors humming, machines moving, and worker comrades working tirelessly. The great power of the working class in actively producing was vividly and figuratively reflected before our eyes today. Seeing this situation, we felt as if a group meeting had just ended, and the comrades had given me severe criticism. I discovered the petit-bourgeois fanaticism and fantasy illness existing in my thoughts. Originally, I admired the working class not because of the greatness of their labor, but with vanity, admiring their "glory." It was as if doing work was not for anything else, but to obtain the praise of others, to obtain one's own glory. And to obtain the praise and glory of others as effortlessly as possible. Thinking carefully, how wrong this kind of thinking is. I "lightened" the life of the workers with petit-bourgeois sentimentality. I thought, if I were asked to do this kind of work, I might not even be able to do it for a day.
    Combining this with my past thoughts, I also thought about my work in the company. In the past, I was always dissatisfied, thinking that army work was not to my taste, and I always wanted to ask the leaders to transfer me to a "suitable" work post. What a selfish thought this is! In the past, comrades criticized me for having the tail of the petty bourgeoisie, and I was always unhappy, even sometimes feeling resentful, feeling that the comrades criticized people vaguely, liked to put a hat on people, and said "petty-bourgeois consciousness!" without regard to whether people had changed or not. After this visit, I truly understood my own petty-bourgeois temperament, truly still very strong, and the petty-bourgeois fantasy illness and fanaticism still existed, and the worldview of wholeheartedly serving the people had not been well established. In the future, I must accept the criticism of the comrades, examine my own thoughts, correct my shortcomings, and strive for progress. The first self-criticism I made after returning from this visit was: to settle down to work, no longer to demand a transfer because of my own interests, and to firmly be a member of the "forever a fighting team."

　　参观长辛店工厂后
    张铭
    我是一个缺乏生产知识的青年学生，从小没有参加过劳动；因此，也不了解劳动人民的伟大。
    解放后，学习了社会发展史及中国革命基本问题，明白了劳动创造世界的道理，知道了工人阶级是最富有组织性、纪律性，革命最坚决最彻底的领导阶级。同时，在报纸上又常看到待解放区的工人英勇地展开与国民党反动派作斗争保护资财，解放区的工人，提高了阶级觉悟，积极发展生产。这时就开始在我的脑子里意识到工人的地位和作用。并且好几次在开大会的时候，工人们和我们一起参加，穿着崭新的制服，唱着各种愉快热情的歌曲，因此，我对工人阶级的情感也亲近了，甚至有时竟抱怨自己以前怎么不也当一个工人——如果是一个工人够多么光荣和伟大啊！
    上月末，我们有机会到工厂参观，进入工厂以后，看见屋子里到处排列着马达和机器，地下也没有地毡（我以前是有这种想法的），却堆满着铁砂和各种零件，每一个工人同志，都静静地守在自己的工作岗位上目不转晴的工作；一个电焊工人，穿着破皮衣服，戴着皮套子眼镜，紧张地在那里工作，管理汽锤的工人，兢兢业业一点也不敢分神，截螺丝钉的工人，随着机器的一上一下，也不容有半秒钟的马虎。于是，我心中有一种说不出的味道，这眼前的工人生活，不是我以前每次在工厂外边走过时，所幻想的有着无限神秘的极诱惑人的感觉了。尤其在我看到炼钢工人，每人都拿着一把大钳子，站在机器的两旁，火红的钢条，从这边进去，从那边出来，从那边进去，又从这边出来，他们手不停息的送来送去，累得满脸大颗汗珠子向下淌。我不自觉的向引导我们参观的工人同志说：“他们整天就这样工作吗？”那位同志望了望我，不知道我问话的意义在什么地方，但很激动的回答说：“对，他们整天就这样做”。接着又说：“现在工作还不算太紧张，逢到外边定货多时，工作还要更紧张。”
    以后，我们又参观了许多地方，到处是马达在响，机器在动，工人同志们手不停息的工作。工人阶级积极生产的伟大力量，今天生动而形象的映在我们眼前了。我们看到这个情形，好象觉得是刚开罢小组会，同志们给了我严厉的批评似的，我发觉了我思想中存在着的小资产阶级的狂热、幻想病。原来我以前钦佩工人阶级，并不是因为他们劳动的伟大，而是怀着虚荣心，钦佩他们的“光荣”。好象做工作，不是为了别的，而是为了取得别人的赞美，取得自己的光荣。而且尽可能的不费一丝一毫的气力来取得别人的赞美和光荣。细想起来，这种思想是多么错误啊。我把工人的生活用小资产阶级的情调把他“轻松”化了。我想，要叫我作这种工作，也许一天也干不下去。
    结合着自己过去的思想，我又想到我在连队上工作，过去一直不满意，认为军队工作不合胃口，老想请求上级调动我到“合适”的工作岗位上去。这是多么自私的思想啊！以前同志们批评我有小资产阶级的尾巴，我总是不悦服，甚至有时感到愤愤，觉得同志们批评人不具体，好给人戴个帽子，动不动就说一句：“小资产阶级的意识！”也不管人家转变了没有。经过这一次参观，自己才真正了解自己小资产阶级的气质，真正还浓厚得很，小资产阶级的幻想病狂热性还存在着，全心全意为人民服务的人生观还没有很好的树立。以后必须好好地接受同志们的批评，检查自己的思想，改正缺点，力求进步。这一次参观回来后，我首先作的检讨是：安心工作，不再为自己兴趣而要求调动工作，坚定地做个“永远是个战斗队”中的一员。
