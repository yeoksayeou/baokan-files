The Guangzhou-Shenzhen section of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway officially reopened on the 1st; the Guangzhou-Shaoguan section of the Yuehan Railway can only temporarily reach Yuantan because the Pazhou Iron Bridge was destroyed by fleeing Kuomintang bandit troops. The Guangzhou-Sanshui line, a branch of this railway, can reach the Southwest Town. Yuejiang shipping is also gradually recovering, and regular liners between ports in the East River and North River have resumed operations one after another. On the highways: there are buses back and forth between Guangzhou-Shaoguan, Guangzhou-Meixian (County), and Guangzhou-Conghua; the two lines from Guangzhou to Hengyang and Ganzhou have long been open.
