　　菲八打雁省省府所在地  发生反季里诺武装哗变
    季里诺承认局势严重菲京实行戒严
    【新华社北京二十六日电】据合众社马尼拉二十三日电引菲律宾官方消息，菲律宾八打雁省省府八打雁城于十九日发生武装哗变。哗变的军队首先袭击八打雁城中的警备队总部、警察总部与两个军械局，然后退至该城以南的皮特山中，并正与政府增援部队进行激战。参加这次哗变的人数，官方估计为三百人，但私人方面则估计为六百人。据菲律宾警备队二十三日公布，在两天作战中，警备队方面死十二人，伤六人，哗变部队死二人。
    季里诺政府在这次军事哗变发生后，十分慌张。马尼拉已于二十三日起实行宵禁，每晚八时起实行戒严，季里诺曾于二十三日晨召见警备队司令，并在随后举行的记者招待会上承认：八打雁的情势“异常严重”。
