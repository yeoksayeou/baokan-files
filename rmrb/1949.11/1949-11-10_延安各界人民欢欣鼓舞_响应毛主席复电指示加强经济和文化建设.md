Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 9th: Chairman Mao's reply to the people of all circles in Yan'an and the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region on the 26th of last month brought unspeakable joy and encouragement to the people of all circles in Yan'an. They unanimously thanked Chairman Mao for his warm and cordial concern for them, and expressed their determination to resolutely implement Chairman Mao's important instruction to "continue to unite as one, quickly heal the wounds of war, and develop economic construction and cultural construction." Cao Liru, Director of the Shaanxi Northern Administrative Office, Li Hebang, Secretary of the Shaanxi Northern District Party Committee, and Wu Daifeng, Commander of the Military Region, all made speeches after reading the reply. Li Hebang said: Chairman Mao directly gave us instructions, which shows his deep concern and high expectations for the people of Yan'an and the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, whom he personally nurtured and led for many years. We should be more modest and down-to-earth, and carry forward the spirit of hard struggle, according to Chairman Mao's instructions. Cao Liru particularly pointed out: The winter schools in various places must use this telegram as an important teaching material, so that all the people in northern Shaanxi understand the direction of their future efforts. Wu Daifeng called for intensifying the training of local armed forces and universally strengthening the establishment of militia organizations to protect local security and ensure the completion of the task of restoring and developing production. Bu Jifu, Deputy County Chief of Yan'an County, thanked Chairman Mao for his concern on behalf of the 80,000 people of Yan'an. He said: We must realize the plan to restore the county's production to the pre-war level in 1950. The Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Democratic Women's Federation responded to Chairman Mao's call by organizing women to develop textiles and participate in winter schools in winter. Workers at the Yan'an Chemical Plant and Power Plant actively responded to Chairman Mao's call by increasing production. After learning of Chairman Mao's reply, Yang Buhao, a famous labor hero in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, excitedly raised his hand and shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!" He said: We should work harder to develop production in order to answer Chairman Mao's concern! He then proposed the winter production competition conditions for his village, Shijiapan, and another village, Yangjuangou: The whole village should plow 100 mu of autumn land, accumulate 400 bags of fertilizer, chop 50,000 jin of firewood, and women should spin 120 jin of cotton. In order to effectively implement Chairman Mao's instructions, the Yan'an garrison guard battalion has begun to use Chairman Mao's reply as study material, and other units will also conduct in-depth study and discussion.
