　　Upholding Party Discipline

　　Deng Naiping Admitted to the Party for Half a Year
  　　Lacking the Qualities of a Communist Party Member
    Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party Decides to Revoke His Probationary Membership
    [Our Newspaper] To uphold Party discipline and maintain the purity of the Party, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party decided on October 15 to revoke Deng Naiping's probationary membership. The decision stated:
    "Deng Naiping joined the Party in March 1949 at Peking University (student in the Physics Department). He comes from a family of old warlords, was educated in missionary schools for a long time, and was deeply influenced by Anglo-American imperialism. He fundamentally lacks the spirit of serving the people and proletarian consciousness. After joining the Party, his thinking has not changed; he regards the mass work carried out by the Party as manipulation and conspiracy; he considers criticism from comrades as "spiritual offensive"; he slanders the Party's decisions, which must be implemented by Party members, as "blind obedience," and says that Party members all have a "Party look." He is ideologically alien and organizationally undisciplined. After studying at the Party training class during the summer vacation, he still made no progress. On the contrary, he believes that the Party and the Communist Youth League should not establish branches in schools; he dislikes the complaints and struggles of workers and peasants; and he feels that he cannot accept Sino-Soviet friendship emotionally. In June and August of this year, he twice expressed his desire to withdraw from the Party, and then withdrew his request himself. (He should have been allowed to withdraw from the Party at that time; it was wrong not to order him to withdraw from the Party immediately.) Based on the above facts, it shows that after being admitted to the Party, Deng Naiping still maintains his seriously class-alien thoughts after half a year of education and is completely unqualified to be a Communist Party member. After discussion by the branch of the Department of Science of Peking University, all members voted to revoke his probationary membership. In order to uphold Party discipline and maintain the purity of the Party organization, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has approved the decision of the General Branch of Peking University and pointed out that this decision must be publicized, and the Party branch should organize discussions to educate all Party members."

　　邓乃平入党半年
  　毫无共产党员品质
    中共北京市委会决定取消其候补党员资格
    【本报讯】中国共产党北京市委会为严肃党的纪律，保持党的纯洁，于十月十五日决定取消邓乃平的候补党员资格。决定称：
    “邓乃平于一九四九年三月在北大入党（物理系学生），他是旧军阀家庭出身，长期在教会学校读书，深受英美帝国主义教育影响，根本缺乏为人民服务的精神和无产阶级的意识。混入党内后，思想仍无转变，把党所进行的群众工作认为是操纵、阴谋；对同志的批评，认为是“精神攻势”；对于党员必须执行党的决定，诬为“盲目服从”，并说党员都有“党相”。在思想上是异己的，在组织上是目无组织和纪律的。暑期经党训练班学习后，仍无进步，反认为党和青年团不应在学校成立支部；讨厌工农群众的诉苦、斗争；对中苏友好认为在感情上实在无法接受。并于今年六月和八月，曾两次表示要求脱党，随后又自行撤回。（当时应即允其脱党，没有令其立即退党是错误的。）根据以上事实说明邓乃平入党后，经半年的教育，仍保持其严重的阶级异己的思想，完全不够作一个共产党员的条件，经北大理学院支部大会讨论后，全体通过取消其候补党员资格。中共北京市委为了严肃党的纪律，保持党的组织纯洁，已批准北大总支部的决定，并指出须公布此决定，党的支部更应组织讨论，借以教育全体党员。”
