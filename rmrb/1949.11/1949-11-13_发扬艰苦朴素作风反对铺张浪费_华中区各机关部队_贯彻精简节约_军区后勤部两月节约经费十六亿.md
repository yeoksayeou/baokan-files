Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 10th: Since the launch of the streamlining and thrift campaign in Wuhan in August, various organs and troops have achieved results in streamlining organizations, production savings, and improving the ideological style of staff members by October. Some experiences and lessons have also been learned.

In terms of streamlining organizations, the Headquarters, Political Department, and Logistics Department of the Central China Military Region, the Wuhan Municipal People's Government, and the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party merged a total of 13 sections, streamlining more than 6,000 personnel, accounting for about 30% of the original number. Seven units, including the Central China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, streamlined 217 cars, accounting for slightly less than 58% of the original vehicles. More than half of the carts and horses were also streamlined. After being trained, a small number of streamlined personnel were transferred to other jobs or sent back to their hometowns voluntarily, while the majority were sent to newly liberated areas to strengthen local lower-level organizations and troops. The vehicles and horses, along with their drivers, were transferred to trade and transportation businesses. The Headquarters of the Central China Military Region alone saved over 50 million yuan in expenses for these three items after streamlining personnel, vehicles, and horses. In terms of production savings, the Logistics Department of the Central China Military Region saved 1.6 billion yuan in expenses in August and September. Water and electricity expenses for various units at the Wuhan municipal level decreased by more than 4 million yuan in August compared to July. In addition, each person saved two liang of grain per day. Based on the current number of personnel in the aforementioned units, more than 100,000 jin of grain were saved in August and September. While saving, various units also opened cooperatives and engaged in vegetable growing, pig raising, and other sideline production, further improving their lives.

After the Streamlining and Thrift Campaign, the Ideology of Cadres Was Transformed

After the streamlining and thrift campaign, the wasteful phenomena of many organs and staff members in the past, as well as the erroneous ideas of demanding treatment, status, and enjoyment, have been transformed and corrected. Staff members are now willing to go to work in the countryside, and those in the city have promoted the fine tradition of hard work and plain living. Also, due to the opposition to extravagance and waste, the concept of cherishing state property has also improved.

The Central China streamlining and thrift campaign has gained the following experiences and lessons: (1) There must be a full ideological mobilization beforehand to raise the consciousness of all personnel. (2) Leading cadres should take the lead. Because there are many new staff members in various departments (especially in the administrative system), the actions of responsible comrades have a great impact on the people below. (3) There must be sound organizational leadership, constant supervision, and inspection to turn some good methods into systems. (4) In terms of savings, in addition to universally practicing careful calculation, business management should be strengthened for departments such as trade, transportation, enterprises, grain, and warehouses to reduce and eliminate the waste and loss of large quantities of materials. Expenditures should be tightened, but attention must be paid to taking care of the actual needs of personnel's lives and work. (5) The handling of streamlined personnel must be cautious. The reasons for streamlining should be explained to them sincerely, and the handling should be prompt and thorough.

    发扬艰苦朴素作风反对铺张浪费
    华中区各机关部队
    贯彻精简节约
    军区后勤部两月节约经费十六亿
    【新华社汉口十日电】武汉市各机关部队自八月展开精简节约运动以来，至十月止，在精简编制、生产节约及工作人员思想作风的改进上均获有成绩，并取得若干经验教训。
    在精简编制方面，华中军区司令部、政治部、后勤部、武汉市人民政府、中共武汉市委会等五个单位共裁并了十三个科，精简人员六千余，占原有人数百分之三十左右。中共中央华中局等七个单位精简了大小汽车二百一十七辆，占原有车辆百分之五十八弱。又精简了大车及马匹一半以上。精简的人员经集训后，小部介绍转业或在自愿条件下遣送回籍，大部则派到新解放区充实了地方下层机构及部队。车辆马匹则随同驾驶者转入贸易及运输事业。仅华中军区司令部在精简人员及车辆马匹后，即节省了这三项的开支五千余万元。在生产节约方面，华中军区后勤部八、九两月节约了经费十六亿元，武汉市级各单位水电开支，八月份比七月份减少了四百余万元。此外，每人每日节约粮食二两，以上述各单位现有人数计，八、九两月即节约粮食十万多斤。与节约同时，各单位还开设了合作社，进行了种菜、养猪及其他副业生产，使生活获得进一步的改善。
    经过精简节约运动  干部思想得到改造
    经过精简节约运动后，过去不少机关和工作人员的浪费现象及闹待遇、闹地位、闹享乐的错误思想都获得了转变和纠正。工作人员愿意到农村去工作了，在城里的则发扬了艰苦朴素的优良作风。又因为反对了铺张浪费，爱护国家财产的观念也有了进步。
    华中精简节约运动获得了如下的经验教训：（一）事前要有充分的思想动员，提高全体人员的自觉性。（二）首长起带头作用。因为各部门里（特别是行政系统）新参加工作的人很多，负责同志的行动对下边的人员影响很大。（三）要有健全的组织领导，随时督促检查，将一些好的办法变为制度。（四）节约方面除普遍做到精打细算外，对贸易、运输、企业、粮食、仓库等部门，更要加强业务的管理，以减少和杜绝大批物资的浪费和损失。开支要紧缩，但必须注意照顾人员的生活和工作的实际需要。（五）对精简人员的处理要慎重，对他们要诚恳地说明精简的道理，处理要迅速周到。
