　　Tangshan City Federation of Trade Unions Decides to
    Establish Workers' Spare-Time Regular Schools
  　First, Two Typical Demonstrations at Kailuan South Factory
    [Tangshan City News] In order to improve workers' cultural, political, and technical level, and to cultivate worker cadres, the Cultural and Educational Department of the Tangshan City Federation of Trade Unions convened a joint meeting of relevant departments and decided to establish long-term, regularized spare-time schools in a planned manner.  First, typical demonstrations will be carried out at Kailuan and South Factory, and the experience will be promoted to other factories and mines. The classes are divided into three classes: elementary school (two years to graduate), high elementary school (one year to graduate), and junior high school (two years to graduate). The curriculum focuses on cultural courses, with political courses, etc. In addition, the junior high school class will increase technical learning according to the needs of the workers. On the teaching staff, six comrades will be transferred from the cadre cultural supplementary school, and cadres or staff from the respective factories and mines will serve concurrently. Registration is currently being brewing in these two factories.
    The Tangshan Railway Factory convened a meeting of the propaganda and education committees of the factory trade unions on the 28th of last month to decide to formulate a five-year education plan and establish a workers' spare-time supplementary school in the factory's Rotary Elementary School and branch schools. The class divisions will follow the resolution of the joint meeting of the City Federation of Trade Unions, with a total of about fourteen classes in three levels. In addition, a mixed class will be opened to take care of some workers who have a considerable cultural level but need to study mathematics; the curriculum includes culture, mathematics, politics, technology, etc. A school affairs committee has now been established, and the school expenses will be borne by the machine factory branch. Three teachers will be sent by the Municipal Party Committee and the Federation of Trade Unions, and specialized personnel will be hired from among the factory's employees to teach. For workers whose families are outside the city, the factory can provide some materials to help them build houses in the city if they wish to do so in order to facilitate their schooling. As of the 3rd, more than 1,000 people have registered. In addition, out-of-school workers' children can also register. The exam began on the 3rd. According to the factory's existing approximately six hundred illiterate workers, the plan is that after five years, the general cultural level of the factory workers can reach junior high school level.
