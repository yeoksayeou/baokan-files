　　Indian Workers' Representative
　　A Visit with Xie Erfanka
　　Chen Ji

　　“The Indian people have risen up!” Indian workers' representative Xie Erfanka began his conversation with a joyous mood. He said: Today, under the leadership of the Indian working class, the entire Indian people have issued the battle cry: "We want to take the path of Mao Zedong!" In the heart of the Deccan Peninsula, more than 30,000 Indian People's Guerrillas have occupied 13,000 square miles of Hyderabad, liberating 2,500 villages and 5 million farmers. On this free land, they have realized their basic demands, namely: the complete separation of the Indian people from the rule of British imperialism, the overthrow of feudal landlords, the equal distribution of land, the release of all arrested brothers, and the establishment of a democratic government. For a year and a half, Nehru has frantically and continuously carried out sweeps of this liberated area of the Indian people, countless villages have been burned down, and countless heroic people have been killed and arrested, but Nehru has finally failed to defeat the people. The people of Hyderabad will always stand on the side of the working class party—the Communist Party. Nehru tortured the arrested people, demanding that they answer: Where is the headquarters of the Communist Party? Where is the headquarters of the guerrillas? They all refused; when Nehru's gang continued to question them, they said: "We are all Communists!"
　　In India, the vast number of peasants are exploited by feudal landlords and oppressed by usury. Fifteen years ago, there were 35 million landless peasants in India; now, that number has increased to 70 million and is still increasing. The Indian Communist Party's proposition of "Land to the tillers, nationalization of land, and complete cancellation of old debts" has already won the warm support of the vast number of peasants.
　　Regarding the development of the Indian workers' movement, Xie Erfanka said: Today, the Indian working class can not only lead the peasants but also lead the vast number of intellectuals and young students to fight against the imperialists and their running dogs. Under the leadership of the All-India Trade Union Congress, students, teachers, and other cultural and scientific workers across India are demanding that the government add schools, improve teachers' salaries, reduce tuition fees, and launch a struggle against Nehru's chauvinism. Nehru has sent the Indian people to the brink of starvation and has increased the military budget by 50 percent in an attempt to extinguish the people's liberation struggle. The Indian people will never allow such reactionary measures; they have taken action, strikes, class boycotts, and teaching boycotts, one after another, have become a widespread mass movement. Nehru's gang wants to suppress this movement with guns and clubs, but the more it suppresses, the more the resistance movement expands. Elementary school teachers in the United Provinces, in order to demand higher salaries, persisted in a six-month teaching boycott under the suppression of the army and police, without yielding in the slightest.
　　In the struggle for democratic freedom and national independence, the Indian people have eliminated past religious prejudices and ethnic hatred. Xie Erfanka said: "Now we have a common ideal, we have completely forgotten the narrow prejudices of the past, and in our minds there is only one common enemy, that is, the imperialists and Nehru. We will use all our strength to overthrow our common enemy.”
　　All Indian workers are concerned about the safety of Comrade Dange. When the reporter asked about Comrade Dange, an uncontrollable indignation immediately appeared on Xie Erfanka's excited face. Comrade Dange was arrested without any legal procedures, and he and his comrades are suffering cruel torture in prison, not getting enough to eat, not getting enough to wear, not seeing a book, and not getting any news from the outside. They once launched a hunger strike in prison, demanding to be able to have the opportunity to read books and to be able to eat their fill. Their demands immediately received the support of the vast number of people, and telegrams poured in from all over India, demanding the unconditional release of the arrested suffering brothers. Only after they had been on hunger strike for twenty days did Nehru's gang have to agree to their demands. Comrade Dange is very concerned about the heroic struggles of the working-class brothers throughout India and the world. He often says that victory will surely belong to the entire Indian working class, and victory will surely belong to the working class of the whole world.

　　印度工人代表
　　谢尔凡卡访问记
　　陈迹
    “印度人民已经起来了!”印度工人代表谢尔凡卡带着喜悦的心情开始了他的谈话。他说：今天全印度人民在印度工人阶级的领导下，已经发出了战斗的口号：“我们要走毛泽东道路！”在达斯坎半岛中心，三万多印度人民游击队，占领了海德拉巴的一万三千平方英里的土地，解放了两千五百个村庄和五百万农民。在这块自由土地上，他们已经实现了他们的基本要求，那就是：印度人民完全脱离英帝国主义的统治，打倒封建地主，平分土地，释放所有被捕的兄弟，成立民主政权。一年半以来，尼赫鲁曾疯狂地不断地扫荡这个印度人民的解放区，无数的村庄被烧毁，多少英勇的人民被残杀，被逮捕，但是尼赫鲁终于战胜不了人民，海德拉巴的人民永远站在工人阶级的政党——共产党这一边。尼赫鲁严刑拷打被捕的人民，要他们回答：共产党的总部在那里？游击队的总部在那里？他们都拒绝了；在尼赫鲁匪帮继续向他们追问时，他们就说：“我们都是共产党！”
    在印度，广大的农民受着封建地主的剥削，受着高利贷的压迫。十五年前，印度无地农民有三千五百万人，现在已增至七千万人，而且还在不断地增加。印度共产党提出的：“耕者有其田，土地国有化，全部取消旧债”的主张已经获得了广大农民的热烈拥护。
    关于印度工人运动的发展情形，谢尔凡卡说：今天印度工人阶级不仅能领导农民而且同样地能领导广大知识分子和青年学生，向帝国主义者及其走狗作斗争。在全印职工大会的领导下，全印度学生、教师和其他文化科学工作者要求政府增添学校，提高教师待遇，减低学费，展开反对尼赫鲁沙文主义的斗争。尼赫鲁将印度人民送上饥饿线上，还增加了军事预算的百分之五十，企图扑灭人民的解放斗争。印度人民决不允许这种反动措施，他们行动起来了，罢工，罢课，罢教，一个接着一个，已成了广泛的群众运动。尼赫鲁匪帮想以枪弹、木棒来镇压这个运动，然而越镇压越使得反抗运动扩大展开。联合省小学教师为要求提高待遇，在军队警察的压制下，坚持了六个月的罢教运动，丝毫没有屈服。
    在争取民主自由和民族独立的斗争中，印度人民已经消除了以往的宗教偏见和民族仇恨。谢尔凡卡说：“现在我们已有了共同的理想，我们完全忘记了过去的狭隘的偏见，我们的心理只有一个共同敌人，那就是帝国主义者和尼赫鲁，我们将以全部力量，打倒我们的共同敌人。”
    全印度工人都关心着丹吉同志的安危，当记者问及丹吉同志时，一种不可抑制的忿恨立刻现露在谢尔凡卡激动的脸上。丹吉同志是没有经过任何法律手续被捕的，他和他的同志们在监狱里受着残酷的折磨，吃不饱，穿不暖，看不到一本书，得不到外面一点消息。他们曾经在监狱里展开了绝食运动，要求能够得到看书的机会，并使得他们能够吃饱。他们的要求立刻获得了广大人民的支援，从印度各地纷纷发来电报，要求无条件释放被捕的受难兄弟。当他们绝食了二十天之后，尼赫鲁匪帮才被迫答应他们的要求。丹吉同志非常关心着全印度和全世界工人阶级弟兄的英勇斗争，他常说，胜利一定属于全印度工人阶级，胜利一定属于全世界工人阶级。
