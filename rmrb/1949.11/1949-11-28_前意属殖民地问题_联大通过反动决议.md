Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 27th: New York dispatch: The United Nations General Assembly plenary session discussed the issue of former Italian colonies on the 19th and 21st.

There were two proposals submitted to the plenary session. The first was the Soviet proposal, which included granting Libya immediate independence; all foreign troops and military personnel must withdraw from Libyan territory within three months, and all military bases on Libyan territory must be destroyed; Somaliland and Eritrea should be granted independence after five years, and before independence, they should be placed under United Nations trusteeship; Eritrea should also cede part of its territory to Abyssinia, so that the latter can have access to the sea via the port of Assab. The second proposal was supported by colonial powers such as Britain, France, and the United States, and included Libya not being granted independence until 1952; Somaliland being placed under Italian trusteeship, and not being granted independence until ten years later; and sending a so-called fact-finding mission to Eritrea to investigate whether the local people have a "desire for independence."

Due to the coercion and manipulation of the colonial countries, a docile majority in the United Nations General Assembly passed the latter proposal and rejected the Soviet proposal.

The struggle between the two lines in the United Nations General Assembly plenary session once again exposed the imperialist aims of the colonial countries. Soviet representative Arutiunian revealed in his speech at the 21st meeting that the Political Committee's majority proposal was the embodiment of the secret agreement concluded between Bevin and Sforza in May 1949, which stipulated that Libya would be divided among the three countries: Britain would obtain Cyrenaica, France would obtain Fezzan, and Italy would obtain Tripoli. Outwardly, this division will take the form of placing these regions under trusteeship for ten years. In addition, Italy would also obtain Somaliland, under its indefinite trusteeship, and Eritrea would be divided between Abyssinia and British-Egyptian Sudan. This agreement was actually instigated by the United States, which intends to seize at least the key areas in those regions given to Italy and Abyssinia through behind-the-scenes negotiations and economic infiltration. However, Arutiunian pointed out that the imperialist plan to divide the former Italian colonies is not easy to realize in the current situation where the national liberation movement is booming in all colonial and semi-colonial countries.

　　前意属殖民地问题  联大通过反动决议
    【新华社北京二十七日电】纽约讯：联合国大会全体会议于十九日、二十一日讨论前意大利殖民地问题。
    提交全体会议的有两个提案，第一个是苏联的提案，其中包括立即予利比亚独立，全部外国军队和军事人员必须在三个月内撤出利比亚领土，利比亚领土上的一切军事基地必须予以平毁；索马利兰和厄立特里亚应在五年后准予独立，在独立之前，则交由联合国托管；厄立特里亚并应割让一部分领土给阿比西尼亚，俾后者得以经由阿塞布港出海。第二个提案是英法美等有殖民地野心的国家所支持的提案，其中包括利比亚须至一九五二年方准独立；索马利兰由意大利托管，十年后方准独立；派遣所谓事实调查团前往厄立特里亚调查当地人民是否有“独立的愿望”。
    由于殖民国家的高压与操纵，联合国大会中驯服的多数通过了后一提案，并否决了苏联的提案。
    在联合国大会全体会议上进行的两条路线的斗争，又一次暴露了殖民国家的帝国主义目的。苏联代表亚鲁疆在二十一日会议上发言时揭露：政委会多数的提案，是一九四九年五月贝文和史佛卓所缔结的秘密协定的体现，这个协定规定利比亚由三国瓜分，即：英国获得昔兰尼加，法国获得法赞，而意大利则取得黎波里。在外表上，这次瓜分将采取把这些地区托管十年的形式。此外，意大利还获得索马利兰，由它无限期托管，至于厄立特里亚、则规定由阿比西尼亚和英埃苏丹来瓜分。这个协定实际上是由美国鼓动的，它打算以幕后谈判和经济渗入的手段，来攫取至少那些交给意大利与阿比西尼亚的地区中的关键地区。但是，亚鲁疆指出：瓜分前意属殖民地的帝国主义计划，在目前民族解放运动在一切殖民地与半殖民地国家蓬勃发展的情况下，并不是容易实现的。
