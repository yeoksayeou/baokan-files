　　Yumen Oil Field Starts Producing Oil

　　[This newspaper report] (Gansu Daily) reports: Since liberation, thanks to the efforts of workers and engineers, the newly drilled No. 1 oil well in the Yumen Oil Field has started producing oil. Note: The Yumen Oil Field is located near Laojunmiao, more than one hundred *li* southwest of Jiayuguan. It was discovered in the spring of the 27th year of the Republic of China [1938] by geologists Sun Jianchu and Tong Zijing. Preparations for development began in the winter of the 28th year of the Republic of China [1939], and the Yumen Mining Factory was established, belonging to the Chinese Petroleum Corporation of the puppet Resources Committee. From the start of development to the end of the 31st year of the Republic of China [1942], the annual gasoline production reached more than 1.8 million gallons, and it increased thereafter. The products of this mine have always been used to supply highway transportation and military use in Gansu, Qinghai, Xinjiang, Ningxia, and Shaanxi provinces. After being taken over by the People's Government, it will make a great contribution to the development of the people's transportation industry in the Northwest.

　　玉门油矿开始出油
    【本报讯】甘肃日报消息：玉门油矿自解放后，在工人和工程师的努力下，现新掘开的第一号油井已开始出油。按：玉门油矿位于嘉峪关外西南百余里老君庙附近。民国二十七年春为地质学家孙健初、童子敬等人发现，二十八年冬开始筹备开发，成立玉门矿厂，属伪资源委员会中国石油公司。自开发至民国三十一年全年汽油产量即达一百八十余万加仑，嗣后亦有所增加。该矿产品，素以供应甘、青、新、宁、陕等省各地之公路运输及军用之用。此次被人民政府接收后，对于发展人民的西北运输事业，将有很大贡献。
