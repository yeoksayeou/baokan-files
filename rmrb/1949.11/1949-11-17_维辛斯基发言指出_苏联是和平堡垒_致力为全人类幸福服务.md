　　Vyshinsky's Speech Points Out
  　The Soviet Union is a Fortress of Peace
  　Dedicated to Serving the Happiness of All Mankind
    Vyshinsky also delivered a speech. Vyshinsky said: "Some say that understanding the true facts of life in the Soviet Union and the United States is the best way to consolidate Soviet-American friendship. This is very true. For the Soviet Union, understanding these true facts will undoubtedly shatter the evil work done by those who do not like our friendship.
    The Soviet Union is implementing a policy of peace. The Soviet Union demands measures that can guarantee peace for all countries. Soviet foreign policy is based on the principles of cooperation between countries and respect for the sovereign equality of all countries. The Soviet government has been implementing this policy since the first day of the great October Socialist Revolution, which opened a new historical era. The centuries-long dreams of the best representatives of mankind (many of whom contributed their lives to brave dreams) became a reality in October 1917. In October 1917, under the leadership of Lenin and Stalin, the brilliant organizers of the Soviet state, the socialist revolution triumphed in Russia. Socialism has been embodied in the reality of life, and the great Lenin said that this form of Soviet republic is not only a higher form of democracy, but also the only form that can guarantee the most painless transition to socialism. The entire foreign policy of the Soviet government is permeated with the idea of ​​struggling for peace and struggling for international cooperation."
    Vyshinsky recounted several historical facts, pointing out that the first law and first decree passed by the workers' and peasants' Soviet government was the Declaration of Peace, which proposed to the people and governments of all warring countries to immediately begin negotiations on a just and democratic peace, but this proposal was met with fierce resistance from other governments of the Allied Powers.
    Vyshinsky said: "In 1934, Stalin clarified the Soviet Union's foreign policy, saying that the Soviet Union's foreign policy is to maintain peace and strengthen trade relations with all countries (applause). On the eve of World War II in 1939, the Soviet government reiterated its commitment to this policy. "We maintain peace and consolidate our trade relations with all countries. We will always maintain this position as long as they also maintain such relations with the Soviet Union and do not try to infringe upon our interests." That's what Stalin said on March 10, 1939 (applause). All activities, all measures and all policies of the Soviet government in international affairs completely and accurately follow the great principles expressed by Stalin as the foundation of Soviet foreign policy (applause).
    Such a policy is not determined by some transitional and temporary environment. It has arisen in the past and present from the basic interests and immediate needs of the Soviet people. It has arisen in the past and present from the urgent need to devote every day and every hour of peaceful labor to organizing a socialist society and improving the material well-being of all the peoples of the Soviet Union. It is also due to the need to meet the diverse and increasing requirements of new life. ... Socialism and peace are two brothers. That is why the true creators of socialism hate war and need peace, because peace guarantees the possibility of creative work (applause). No threat and no group can force the Soviet Union to deviate from the path of fighting for peace and the security of all countries (applause).
    After the Soviet Union, together with other member states of the Soviet-British-American alliance, victoriously ended the war against Hitlerite Germany, it set about restoring peaceful life. As one of the founders of the United Nations, the Soviet Union has always been working unswervingly to strengthen this organization and to oppose all attempts to shake and weaken the United Nations organization so that it cannot become an organization for maintaining peace and the security of all countries. In 1946, 1947 and 1948, the Soviet government put forward a number of proposals aimed at consolidating peace and eliminating the ominous danger of war. Despite the fierce resistance of the warmongers, the Soviet delegation achieved some success at the first, second and third sessions of the United Nations General Assembly. In 1946, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Soviet Union's proposal on universal disarmament and reduction of armed forces, which also included the prohibition of atomic weapons. In 1947, at the initiative of the Soviet Union, a resolution was passed condemning any form of war propaganda. There was less success in 1948, because the Soviet Union's proposal on banning atomic weapons and reducing the armaments and armed forces of the five major powers by one-third was rejected, and the resolution adopted was a meaningless and empty resolution on consultations on the issue of atomic energy and the issue of so-called conventional armaments. When the Fourth United Nations General Assembly was convened, the Soviet Union, adhering to its peace-loving foreign policy, once again issued a call against preparations for a new war and against the use of atomic weapons in violation of the honor and conscience of all countries (applause). The Soviet Union put forward a proposal for the five major powers to conclude an agreement to strengthen peace.
    It has been more than a month and a half since this session of the United Nations General Assembly opened, and these proposals have not yet been considered. Predictably, as in 1948, the organizers and instigators of a new war will use every means to veto the Soviet Union's proposals. They think that in this way, they can avoid abandoning their position, that is, to preserve atomic weapons for themselves at all costs and place them under control that has nothing in common with true international control. The purpose pursued by this kind of control (which is difficult to conceal) is to deceive world public opinion on this issue. The importance of the above-mentioned proposals of the Soviet Union is easy to understand. Although the fact is that the Soviet Union had already discovered the secret of atomic weapons in 1947 and possessed atomic weapons, the Soviet Union's position of banning atomic bombs and establishing strict control has not changed in the slightest (applause). The Soviet Union's struggle to maintain peace relies on the support of millions of people who hate war and yearn for peace. The Soviet Union is a fortress of peace, a banner of peace, and it will continue to serve peace with all its strength and resources for the welfare and happiness of all mankind."

### 维辛斯基发言指出　苏联是和平堡垒　致力为全人类幸福服务

专栏：

　　维辛斯基发言指出
  　苏联是和平堡垒
  　致力为全人类幸福服务
    维辛斯基也发表了演说。维辛斯基说：“有人说，了解苏联与美国生活的真情实况，是巩固美苏友谊的最好的方法。这话说得很对。对于苏联来说，了解这些真情实况无疑地会粉碎那些不喜欢我们友谊的人所作的罪恶工作。
    苏联是执行和平政策的。苏联要求采取可以保证各国和平的措施。苏联外交政策是以各国合作以及尊重各国主权平等的原则为基础的。苏联政府自从开辟了新的历史时代的伟大十月社会主义革命的第一天起，便一直在执行这一政策。人类的最优秀代表（他们中间有许多人为了勇敢的梦想贡献了他们的生命）的几世纪来的梦想，在一九一七年十月变成事实了。一九一七年十月，在苏维埃国家的光辉的组织者列宁与斯大林的领导之下，社会主义革命在俄国胜利了。社会主义已体现在生活现实之中，伟大的列宁说，这种苏维埃共和国不仅是更高的民主制度形式，而且是唯一能够保证最无痛苦地过渡到社会主义去的形式。苏维埃政府的全部外交政策渗透着为和平而斗争，为国际合作而斗争的思想。”
    维辛斯基追述几件历史事实，指出工农苏维埃政府所通过的第一条法律第一号法令，就是和平宣言，它向一切交战国家人民及其政府提议，立即开始进行关于正义、民主的和平的谈判，但这个提议遇到了协约国其他政府的猛烈反抗。
    维辛斯基说：“一九三四年，斯大林阐明苏联外交政策说，苏联的外交政策是维护和平以及加强与一切国家间的贸易关系（鼓掌）。在一九三九年第二次世界大战的前夕，苏维埃政府重申信守这一政策。“我们维护和平，并巩固我国与世界各国间的贸易关系。只要它们也对苏联维持着这样的关系，而不来试图侵犯我国的利益的时候，我们是始终都保持这一立场的”。斯大林在一九三九年三月十日就是这样说的（鼓掌）。苏联政府在国际事务中的一切活动，一切措施与全部方针完全地确切地遵循着斯大林所表示的、作为苏联外交政策基础的伟大原则（鼓掌）。
    这样的政策不是为某种过渡性的暂时环境所决定的。它在过去和现在都是从苏联人民的基本利益与切身需要中产生的。它在过去和现在都是从如下的迫切需要中产生的，即把每天和每小时的和平劳动都用在组织社会主义社会，以及提高苏联各族人民的物质福利上面。它也是由于需要满足新生活的多种多样的、日益增加的要求而产生的。……社会主义与和平是两个弟兄。这就是为什么真正的社会主义缔造者仇恨战争而需要和平，因为和平保障了创造性工作的可能性（鼓掌）。任何威胁和任何集团皆不能迫使苏联离开为和平与各国安全而斗争的道路（鼓掌）。
    苏联在与苏英美同盟中的其他成员国家一起，胜利地结束了反对希特勒德国的战争之后，即着手恢复和平生活。作为联合国的创建者之一，苏联始终不渝地进行工作，以加强这一组织，反对动摇与削弱联合国机构使之不成其为维护和平与各国安全之机构的一切企图。在一九四六、一九四七与一九四八年，苏联政府提出了若干旨在巩固和平与消灭不祥的战争危险的建议。不顾战争贩子们的猛烈抵抗，苏联代表团在联合国大会第一、二、三届会议上获得了一定的成功。一九四六年，联合国大会通过了苏联关于普遍裁减军备和裁减武装部队的建议，其中也包括禁止原子武器。一九四七年，在苏联的倡议之下，通过了谴责任何形式的战争宣传的决议案。一九四八年的成功较小，因为苏联关于禁止原子武器以及减少五强军备与武装部队三分之一的建议，遭到否决，而通过的决议却是一项关于就原子能问题以及所谓通常军备的情报问题进行咨商的毫无内容、毫无意义的决议。当第四次联合国大会召开时，苏联信守着爱好和平的外交政策，再次发出反对新战争准备，反对违反各国荣誉与良心而使用原子武器的呼声。（鼓掌）苏联提出了五强缔结加强和平的建议。
    自从这次联合国大会开会以来，到现在已有一个半月以上了，这些建议案一直未能得到考虑。可以预料，一如一九四八年一样，新战争的组织者和鼓动者将用一切手段把苏联的建议案否决。他们以为这样一来，就可以使他们无须放弃他们的立场，即不惜一切代价为自己保存原子武器，将原子武器放在与真正的国际管制毫无相同之处的管制下。这种管制所追求的目的（很难隐蔽）就是在这个问题上欺骗世界舆论。苏联上述建议案之重要性是易于理解的。虽然事实上苏联在一九四七年就已经发现原子武器的秘密，并且握有原子武器，但是，苏联的禁止原子弹及建立严格的管制的立场，却毫未改变（掌声）。苏联的维护和平的斗争，依靠千百万嫌恶战争和渴望和平的广大人民的支持。苏联是和平的堡垒、和平的旗手，它将继续为了全人类的福利与幸福，用一切力量和资源为和平服务。”
