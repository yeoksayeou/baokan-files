　　Zhang City's Epidemic Prevention Propaganda Deepens
　　Masses are Disinfecting and Receiving Injections
　　Several Cases of Sudden Death Inside and Outside the City Have Undergone Autopsy and Examination

　　[Our newspaper's special dispatch from Zhangjiakou on the 2nd] Zhang City's epidemic prevention work is gradually unfolding. Each district has established an epidemic prevention station, with the chief of the Public Security Sub-bureau serving as the station chief. Each police station has set up a central epidemic prevention team, responsible for monitoring and reporting the epidemic situation, and mobilizing the masses to carry out activities such as catching rats, eliminating fleas, and cleaning up. The Second District has successively convened meetings of neighborhood chiefs, symposiums for doctors, and meetings of street epidemic prevention directors and deputy directors. On October 30th, it convened a meeting of Party branch committee members to convey and mobilize, calling on Communist Party members to take the lead in epidemic prevention. The masses in this district have generally carried out major clean-ups, and some households have sprinkled carbolic acid and lime. The First and Third Districts have not been serious enough in carrying out epidemic prevention. After assigning work, they lacked timely, level-by-level inspection and lacked in-depth publicity and education, which resulted in the failure to rapidly and universally launch mass-based epidemic prevention work in these two districts. Yesterday and today, the Chahar Province Epidemic Prevention Work Committee held its fifth meeting, resolving to strengthen the city's epidemic prevention work. Specific measures are under study.

　　张市防疫宣传深入
  　群众正消毒注射
    市内外屡有暴死事件已进行解剖检验工作
    【本报张家口二日专电】张市防疫工作逐渐展开，各区已组成防疫站，由公安分局长任站长；各派出所设中心防疫组，负责掌握与报告疫情及动员群众进行捕鼠灭蚤打扫等工作。二区相继召开了闾长会议、医生座谈会、街防疫正副主任会议，并于十月三十日召开了党的支部委员会议，进行传达动员，号召共产党员在防疫中起带头作用。该区群众已普遍的进行大打扫，并有部分人家洒了石炭酸水、石灰。一、三区进行防疫不够认真，布置工作后缺乏及时逐级检查，缺乏深入的宣传教育，致使该两区群众性的防疫工作未能迅速普遍开展起来。昨、今两日察省防疫工作委员会开第五次会议，决加强该市防疫工作，具体办法在研究中。
