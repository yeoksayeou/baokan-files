　　The Great October Socialist Revolution Opened the Road to a Prosperous Life for the Soviet People
　　Yakof Userilenko
　　Many centuries of human history have experienced many revolutions. The replacement of one socio-economic system by another has always been achieved through revolution. However, whether it was the replacement of the slave-owning system by the feudal system, or the replacement of the feudal system by the capitalist system, the living conditions of the people did not fundamentally change. Society was still divided into a tiny minority of exploiters and an overwhelming majority of the exploited. One group of exploiters replaced another.

　　The Great October Socialist Revolution was an unprecedented revolution in the world, which has not only shown the people its political consequences but also its material consequences. The Russian socialist revolution opened a new era in human history, an era of establishing a classless communist society, which not only broke the shackles of capitalism and gave freedom to the people but also created the material conditions for the affluent life of hundreds of millions of people. The great power of the Russian socialist revolution and its invincibility lie here.

　　Stalin said: "It is of course very good to drive away the capitalists, drive away the landlords, drive away the Tsar's guards, seize power and gain freedom. However, it is a pity that freedom alone is not enough. If there is a lack of bread, a lack of butter and oil, a lack of factories, and very bad housing, then freedom alone is still not enough."

　　The Great October Socialist Revolution and the victory of Soviet socialism have forever eliminated the exploiting classes and embarked on the road of developing the material and spiritual forces of the people for the benefit of the whole society. The elimination of unemployment and the poverty that accompanies it in the Soviet Union, the continuous increase in industry and the number of the working class, the continuous increase in the labor productivity of workers and collective farmers, and the unprecedented upsurge in science and technology have all created practical conditions in the Soviet Union for increasing the material welfare of the working masses. This is primarily manifested in the increase in national income. In 1938, the Soviet Union's national income had increased fivefold compared to pre-revolutionary Russia's national income. The national income in 1938 was 105 billion rubles, while the national income in 1913 was 21 billion rubles. In 1940, the Soviet Union's national income had increased more than sixfold compared to 1913. In the post-war Five-Year Plan, the Soviet Union's national income will further increase to 177 billion 700 million rubles by 1950.

　　In pre-revolutionary Russia, the income of the laboring people, who accounted for 84.1 percent of the national population, accounted for only 25 percent of the national income; the income of capitalists, landlords, rich peasants, merchants, and speculators, who accounted for 15.9 percent of the national population, accounted for 75 percent of the national income.

　　In the Soviet Union, all national income is used to meet the social and personal needs of the laboring people. In the Soviet Union, not a single kopeck belongs or can belong to the parasitic exploiting classes, because this is impossible in a socialist society.

　　It should be mentioned that in the United States and Britain, the income of the laboring people, who account for the overwhelming majority of the national population, is less than 40 percent of the national income. In connection with this, what does the British Labour Party's false propaganda about the socialist nature of the current British government look like? This "socialism" obviously conforms to the interests of the British bourgeoisie; it enables them to seize the largest part of the British national income.

　　The elimination of unemployment and the continuous increase in the number of workers and staff members are important proof of the increase in the material welfare of the Soviet laboring people as a consequence of the Great October Socialist Revolution. From 1928 to 1940 alone, the number of workers and staff members in the Soviet Union increased from 10.8 million to 31.2 million, an increase of approximately threefold. In the first three years of the post-war Five-Year Plan, the number of workers and staff members engaged in the social production of the socialist state continued to increase quarter by quarter and has increased by 6.2 million. In the second quarter of this year, the number of workers and staff members in the Soviet Union increased by 1.6 million compared to the same period in 1948.

　　Politicians and sociologists in capitalist societies have repeatedly declared the right to work for everyone. Various bourgeois political parties have formulated countless programs, manifestos, and statements, in which they declare the right to work as an inalienable right enjoyed by everyone. However, these declarations and statements remain mere empty talk on paper, because the bourgeoisie is not at all concerned and never intends to guarantee the right to work for everyone. Capitalist countries cannot exist without unemployment and without a reserve army of labor. Unemployment is a child of capitalism.

　　In socialist countries, it is completely different. There, the political power is in the hands of the workers and peasants, social production is carried out on the basis of socialist common ownership, economic development is in line with the interests and needs of the people, and the exploiting classes have been eliminated. Only in socialist society can the root cause of unemployment—the capitalist mode of production—be eliminated. Only in socialist society will the right to work stipulated in the Stalin Constitution be guaranteed. In the Soviet Union, everyone has full freedom to choose the sector of social production of material or spiritual value in which he is willing to dedicate his strength, knowledge, and talent.

　　The army of unemployed in capitalist countries is expanding day by day. How can capitalist countries be compared with the indisputable fact that unemployment does not exist in the Soviet Union and unemployment is impossible? The imperialist world can only speak through the mouth of its most unscrupulous spokesperson, such as what the magazine "The Banker," an organ of the American banking group, wrote after the war. This magazine shamelessly said: "One of the most ridiculous ideas in our time is the idea that everyone has the right to work."

　　In socialist countries, it is not only guaranteed that everyone obtains work. Any worker, collective farmer, or intellectual knows that the increase in national income obtained through his selfless labor and creative efforts guarantees the continuous increase in his real wages. From 1928 to 1940, the average wages of workers and staff members in the Soviet Union increased approximately sixfold. The annual wage fund increased from 8.2 billion rubles to 162 billion rubles during these years, an increase of twentyfold. In 1929, the real wages of workers and staff members in the Soviet Union had already increased by 67 percent compared to the 1913 level. During the Second Five-Year Plan, the real wages of workers and staff members increased again by twofold. During the post-war period, the real wages of workers and staff members in the Soviet Union continued to increase constantly. Especially after the abolition of the rationing system in 1947, and due to the repeated reductions in the prices of people's necessities, there was a significant leap forward in the increase in real wages. The collective farm system eliminated poverty in the countryside, and it finally and forever eliminated the phenomenon of landlessness and livestocklessness among the peasants. The land owned by the collective farmers was equal to three times the land owned by poor and middle peasants in pre-revolutionary Russia. From 1932 to 1940, the monetary income of collective farms increased to four and a half times. Before the Great War, the collective funds of collective farms exceeded 21 billion rubles, of which one-tenth was the property of former peasants, and nine-tenths was accumulated under the collective farm system. Compared with the income of peasants in pre-revolutionary Russia, the significant increase in the income of Soviet peasants can be seen particularly clearly. In 1914, the income that peasants obtained from selling bread, flax, milk, and other products reached 1.8 million rubles. In 1937, the cash income of the Soviet countryside had already reached more than 30 billion rubles, an increase of approximately seventeenfold compared to 1914. Although the war caused great material losses to the rural economy, the collective farms' income in kind and cash income continued to increase during the post-war period.

　　Engels wrote in "Anti-Dühring": "The inadequacy of mass consumption is a prerequisite for all social systems based on exploitation. The capitalist system leads to the absolute and relative impoverishment of the masses. The laboring people obtain a small portion of the social products, while the majority of the social products belong to the ruling exploiting class." Lenin wrote: "The contradiction between production and consumption inherent in the capitalist system lies in the fact that the increase in national wealth goes hand in hand with the deepening of poverty of the people, and social forces are increased under the condition that people's consumption is not sufficiently increased..."

　　Lenin's brilliant analysis particularly powerfully demonstrates the situation of the masses in capitalist countries during the current period of deepening general crisis of capitalism. We do not need to look for examples from afar. The facts that are happening in Britain, and that other capitalist countries are subsequently following, which are related to the devaluation of the pound sterling, can prove that the ruling class is trying to maintain and increase its profits by adopting means of further depressing the living standards of the laboring masses. The Labour Party leaders cannot distort or conceal the fact that the British people are increasingly sinking into absolute and relative poverty.

　　The Great October Socialist Revolution eliminated the contradiction between production and consumption inherent in the capitalist system. In the Soviet Union, the increase in consumption runs parallel to the increase in production. The entire national economy of the Soviet Union is developing for the benefit of the people. Caring for humanity, caring for the people, this is the most sacred task in socialist society, and it is the responsibility of all its state institutions and social organizations.

　　In the thirty-two years since the Great October Socialist Revolution, the Soviet laboring people have not only improved their welfare in several Five-Year Plans, but have also enjoyed the material consequences of the great revolution that opened a new era in human history. The life of the Soviet people today, a better, more pleasant, and happier life, is no longer comparable to the life of the past.

　　The peak of human happiness is ahead, at which time every worker will be able to satisfy his material and spiritual interests and demands according to his needs. This is the communist society that the great Soviet people, under the leadership of the Lenin-Stalin Party, are building with confidence and success.

　　伟大的十月社会主义革命为苏联人民开辟了走向富裕生活之路
    雅可夫·乌谢林科
    好几世纪的人类历史经历了不少的革命。一种社会经济制度之替换另一种社会经济制度从来都是通过革命方式来实现的。可是封建制度之替换奴隶占有制度，资本主义制度之替换封建制度，人民大众的生活状况都是没有根本改变。社会仍然划分为区区少数的剥削者和压倒多数的被剥削者。一种剥削者替换了另一种剥削者。
    伟大的十月社会主义革命是世界上史无前例的这样一次革命，它不仅已经向人民显现出它的政治后果，并且还显现出它的物质后果。俄国的社会主义革命开创了人类历史的新纪元，没有阶级的共产主义社会之建立的纪元，它不仅打破了资本主义的枷锁和给人民以自由，并且还创造了数以万万计的人民的富裕生活的物质条件。俄国社会主义革命的伟大力量和它的不可被战胜性就在这里。
    斯大林说：“把资本家赶走，把地主赶走，把沙皇卫队赶走，取得政权与获得自由，这当然很好。然而，很遗憾，单单有自由是很不够的。如果缺乏面包，缺乏牛油和油，缺少制造厂，住得很坏，那末，单单有自由还是很不够的。”
    伟大的十月社会主义革命和苏联社会主义的胜利，永远消灭了剥削阶级，并且走向为整个社会利益而发展人民的物质及精神力量的道路。失业现象以及与它相伴随着的贫穷现象之在苏联消除，工业和工人阶级人数的不断增加，工人和集体农民的劳动生产率的不断提高，科学和技术的空前高涨，这一切就在苏联创造了劳动群众物质福利增高的实际条件。这首先表现在国民收入的增加上。在一九三八年，苏联的国民收入已经增加到革命以前俄国的国民收入的五倍，一九三八年国民收入为一千零五十亿卢布，而一九一三年国民收入为二百十亿卢布。一九四○年苏联的国民收入已增加到一九一三年的六倍以上。在战后五年计划中，苏联国民收入到一九五○年将进一步增至一千七百七十亿卢布。
    在革命以前的俄国，占全国人口百分之八十四点一的劳动人民的收入，仅占国民收入的百分之二十五；总共占全国人口百分之十五点九的资本家、地主、富农、商人、投机家的收入，则占国民收入的百分之七十五。
    在苏联，全部国民收入都是用在满足劳动人民的社会需要和个人需要。在苏联，没有一个戈比属于或者可能属于寄生的剥削阶级，因为在社会主义社会，这是不可能的。
    应当不提到：在美国和英国，占全国人口里压倒多数的劳动人民的收入不及国民收入的百分之四十。与这联系起来，英国工党关于英国现政府的社会主义性质的虚伪宣传看起来象什么呢？这种“社会主义”显然是符合英国资产阶级利益的；它使他们有可能来攫取英国国民收入的最大部分。
    失业现象的消除，和工人及职员的数目的不断增加，乃是一个重要的证明，它说明了作为伟大的十月社会主义革命的后果之苏联劳动人民的物质福利的增高。仅仅在从一九二八年到一九四○年，苏联工人和职员的数目已从一千零八十万增加到三千一百二十万，约增加到三倍。在战后五年计划的头三年内，从事社会主义国家的社会生产的工人和职员的数目继续一季又一季地不断增加，并且已经增加了六百二十万。在本年第二季，苏联工人和职员的数目比一九四八年同期增加一百六十万。
    资本主义社会的政治家和社会学家一再宣称人人有工作权。各个资产阶级政党拟定了不知多少的纲领、宣言和声明，在那里宣布工作权是人人享有的不可剥夺的权利。然而这些宣言和声明仍然只是纸上空谈，因为资产阶级丝毫也不关心并且永远无意保证每个人的工作权。没有失业、没有劳动后备军，资本主义国家就不可能存在。失业是资本主义的产儿。
    而在社会主义国家里则完全是另外一回事。在那里，政权是握在工人和农民手里，社会生产是在社会主义共同所有制的基础上进行，经济的发展是符合于人民的利益和需要的，剥削阶级已经被消灭。只有在社会主义社会，才能消灭失业的根源——资本主义生产方式。只有在社会主义社会，斯大林宪法中所规定的工作权才会获得保证。在苏联，人人都有充分的自由来选择他所愿意在其中献出他的力量、知识和才能之有物质价值或精神价值的社会生产部门。
    资本主义国家里的失业大军是在一天一天地扩大着，怎么能把资本主义国家来与在苏联失业现象不存在和失业不可能的无可置辩的事实相比拟呢？帝国主义世界只能借它的最肆无忌惮的代言人之口来讲象美国银行集团机关刊物“银行家”杂志在战后所写的那种话。这个杂志无耻地说：“在我们时代里最可笑的想法之一，就是认为人人都有工作权”。
    在社会主义国家，不仅是保证每个人获得工作。任何一个工人、集体农民、知识分子都知道：由于他的自我牺牲的劳动和创造性的努力而获得的国民收入之增加，保证了他的实际工资的不断增加。从一九二八年到一九四○年，苏联工人和职员的平均工资增加约六倍。工资的每年基金在这些年间从八十二亿卢布增加到一千六百二十亿卢布，即增加二十倍。在一九二九年，苏联工人和职员的实际工资已经比一九一三年水平增加百分之六十七。在第二次五年计划期间，工人和职员的实际工资又增加两倍，在战后期间，苏联工人和职员的实际工资继续在不断地增加，特别是在一九四七年取消配给制度之后，并且由于人民必需品的价格的一再减低，实际工资的增加上又有意义重大的跃进。集体农场制度消除了农村的贫穷，它最后地和永远地消除了农民的无地和无牲畜现象。集体农民所拥有的土地，等于革命以前俄国贫农和中农所拥有的土地的三倍。从一九三二年到一九四○年，集体农场的货币收入增加到四倍半。在大战之前，集体农场的共同资金超过二百十亿卢布，其中十分之一是以前的农民财产，十分之九是在集体农场制度下积累的。与革命以前俄国的农民收入比起来，就能特别明确地显出苏联农民收入的大大增加。一九一四年农民在出卖面包、亚麻、牛奶及其它产品中所获得的收入达一百八十万卢布。在一九三七年，苏联农村的现款收入就已经达到三百亿卢布以上，与一九一四年比起来约增加到十七倍。虽然战争使农村经济遭受巨大的物质损失，但战后时期内集体农场的实物收入和现款收入仍然在继续增加着。
    恩格斯在“反杜林论”里写道：“群众消费的不足，乃是一切以剥削为基础的社会制度的前提条件。资本主义制度导致人民大众的绝对和相对贫穷。劳动人民获得少部分的社会生产品，而大部分的社会生产品则属于居统治地位的剥削阶级。”列宁写道：“资本主义制度所固有的生产与消费之间的矛盾，乃在于：国民财富的增加是和人民贫穷的加深同时并进的，社会力量是在人民消费没有足够增加的条件之下增加的……”。
    列宁这个杰出的分析，特别有力地证明了在目前资本主义总危机加深的时期内资本主义国家的人民大众状况。我们不需要从远处去寻找例子。正在英国发生的、嗣后其他资本主义国家也随着发生的、与英镑贬值相联系着的事实，就能证明统治阶级力图采用进一步压低劳动群众生活水平的手段来维持和增加自己的利润。工党领袖无法歪曲也无法掩饰英国人民愈益加深地陷于绝对和相对贫穷的事实。
    伟大的十月社会主义革命消除了资本主义制度所固有的生产与消费之间的矛盾。在苏联，消费的增加与生产的增加并行。苏联的整个国民经济是为人民的利益而发展着。关心人类，关心人民，这在社会主义社会是最神圣的任务，是它的一切国家机构和社会团体的责任。
    在伟大的十月社会主义革命以来的三十二年间，苏联劳动人民不仅在几个五年计划中增进了福利，并且还享有了开创人类历史新纪元的伟大革命的物质后果。今天苏联人民的生活，更好、更愉快、更幸福的生活，已经不是从前的生活所可比拟。
    人类幸福的高峰就在前面，那时候，每个劳动者都能按照需要来满足他在物质上和精神上的兴趣和要求。这就是伟大的苏联人民在列宁斯大林党领导之下满怀信心地和成功地建设着的共产主义社会。
