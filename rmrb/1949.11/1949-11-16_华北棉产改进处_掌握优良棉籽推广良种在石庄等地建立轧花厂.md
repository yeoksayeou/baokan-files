  　Controls High-Quality Cotton Seeds, Promotes Improved Varieties, and Establishes Cotton Ginning Factories in Shizhuang and Other Places
    [This newspaper's dispatch] In order to control the high-quality cotton seeds in the improved variety management areas, prevent mixing, and facilitate large-scale promotion, the North China Cotton Production Improvement Office convened a joint meeting of cadres from various cotton planting guidance areas at the end of May this year to arrange the establishment of cotton ginning factories. The plan is to establish one electric or diesel-powered factory each in Shijiazhuang, Handan, Lixian, Linqing, and Baxian, and one manual factory in Heze. In Langfang and Nanyuan cotton ginning factories, to reduce costs, gasoline power will be converted to diesel and electricity. At present, the installation, construction, purchase of machinery, and allocation of cadres for each factory have been basically completed. The factory buildings all use old houses, which not only reduces expenses but are also very suitable. For example, the Linqing factory is a former enemy barracks and can accommodate more than one million jin of cotton seeds. All areas are now purchasing improved variety cotton. The factories in Tangshan, Yangliuqing, Langfang, Tongxian, Nanyuan, Shijiazhuang, Heze, and Baxian have started operations successively in early November. The three factories in Linqing, Lixian, and Handan are expected to be fully operational by the end of this month.

  　掌握优良棉籽推广良种在石庄等地建立轧花厂
    【本报讯】华北棉产改进处为掌握良种管理区之优良棉籽，不使混杂，以便大量推广，曾于今年五月底召开各植棉指导区干部联席会议，布置建立轧花厂工作。计划在石家庄、邯郸、蠡县、临清、霸县等地各建立电力或柴油动力厂一个，菏泽建人力厂一个，廊房、南苑轧花厂为减低成本，将汽油动力改为柴油和电力。现各厂安装、修建、购置机器和配备干部等工作已基本上完成。厂房都利用旧房，不仅可以减少开支，且均甚合适。如临清厂是敌人过去之兵营，可容纳棉籽一百万斤以上。现各地都在收购良种棉花。唐山、杨柳青、廊房、通县、南苑、石家庄、菏泽、霸县各厂已在十一月初先后开工。临清、蠡县、邯郸三厂预计本月底可全部开工。
