Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 12th. Thanks to overcoming disasters such as drought, floods, hail, and pests, and through active processing and fertilization, Shandong Province's industrial crops like cotton, peanuts, and hemp still achieved yields comparable to normal years this year. With the support of loans and seeds from the People's Government, the planting area for cotton and peanuts in the province increased by a total of over 3.6 million mu compared to last year. This year, a total of over 3,916,000 mu of cotton were planted, an increase of over 1,720,000 mu compared to last year. With an average yield of 24 jin of net cotton per mu, the total cotton production reached over 939,000 dan. This year, a total of over 4,839,000 mu of peanuts were planted, an increase of 1,940,000 mu compared to last year. With an average yield of 124 jin of peanuts per mu, the total peanut production reached 6 million dan. A total of 140,000 mu of hemp were planted. According to statistics from six counties including Mengyin in Lunan Central District: the average yield per mu was over 80 jin. In June this year, the Shandong Provincial People's Government, in order to encourage farmers to increase the planting of industrial raw material crops, increased the proportion of cotton, hemp, and peanuts in the autumn grain tax, which greatly stimulated farmers' enthusiasm for production. Farmers generally applied more fertilizer and hoed the fields more often for these crops than for other agricultural crops. In addition, the Shandong Provincial People's Government also dispatched technicians to guide cotton planting in areas where cotton planting was not customary. Therefore, although various disasters such as floods and droughts occurred in various places this year, industrial crops still had a normal harvest. Currently, cotton, peanuts, and hemp have been on the market for over a month, and state-owned trading departments and cooperatives in various places are purchasing them in large quantities. The Qingdao and Jinan textile factories are already using new cotton.

    山东各国营贸易部门及合作社
    大量收购棉麻花生
    青岛济南纱厂已用新棉
    【新华社济南十二日电】由于战胜了旱、水、雹、虫等灾害和积极加工施肥，山东省棉花、花生、大麻等工业作物今年产量仍达一般年成。全省农民在人民政府的贷款贷种扶持下今年棉花、花生的种植面等较去年增大了共三百六十余万亩，今年共种棉三百九十一万六千余亩，较去年增种一百七十二万余亩，以每亩平均产净棉二十四斤计，共产棉九十三万九千余担。今年共种花生四百八十三万九千亩，较去年增加一百九十四万亩，以每亩平均产花生一百二十四斤计，共产六百万担。麻共种十四万亩，据鲁中南蒙阴等六县统计：每亩平均产八十余斤。今年六月间山东省人民政府为鼓励农民增植工业原料作物，曾提高了棉、麻、花生等项交纳秋季公粮的比例，因而大大刺激了农民的生产情绪。农民对这些作物一般较其他农作物多施肥，多锄一遍以上。此外，山东省人民政府并派遣技术人员赴没有种棉习惯的地区指导种棉。因此今年各地虽然遭受水旱各种灾害，工业作物仍然有一般年景的收成。现全省棉花、花生、麻已上市月余，各地国营贸易部门及合作社正大量收购，青岛、济南纱厂已用新棉。
