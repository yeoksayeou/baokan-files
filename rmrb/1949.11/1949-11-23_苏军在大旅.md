　　The Soviet Army in Dalian and Lüshun
　　By our reporter, Tian Liu
　　"The Soviet people are a people educated and cultivated by the great Lenin and Stalin. Such people have boundless sincere internationalist friendship towards the Chinese people and even the people of the world. Their assistance to the Chinese people is unconditional and does not require any reward." This is the speech made by Comrade Liu Shaoqi at the inaugural meeting of the All-China Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association, and the people of Dalian and Lüshun have a deep understanding of it. For four years, the people of Dalian and Lüshun have lived in this sincere internationalist friendship. Under the unconditional and uncompensated assistance of the Soviet army, various democratic construction undertakings in the Dalian and Lüshun area have rapidly healed the deep wounds left by the Japanese invaders to the people of Dalian and Lüshun, and have overcome the severe blockade period of the Chiang Kai-shek and American reactionaries, and are thriving. Now there are no beggars, no prostitutes, and no thieves in Dalian and Lüshun, and unemployment has been basically eliminated. By the end of next year, when the two-year construction plan is completed, illiteracy will also be basically eliminated. Industrial construction is advancing rapidly towards surpassing the highest level of the Japanese invaders. The China Changchun Railway, glass factories and many other enterprises have already surpassed it. Electric furnaces that could not be manufactured in the Japanese era, gas pipes necessary for the chemical industry, and many other products have been manufactured here and are being produced continuously. Industries and factories that did not exist in the Japanese era have been established in Dalian and Lüshun, and are continuing to be built. Agricultural production has reached 173 percent of the production volume of 1945, the last year of Japanese rule. New universities and middle schools have been established, and primary schools are universal in every remote village...
　　For four years, in accordance with the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance, the Soviet Red Army stationed in the Dalian and Lüshun area, under the direct leadership of its military headquarters, has provided meticulous and comprehensive assistance to the people of Dalian and Lüshun. In 1946, shortly after the liberation of Dalian and Lüshun, the Chiang Kai-shek and American reactionaries, who were enemies of the people of the whole country, severely blockaded Dalian and Lüshun from land and sea. Factories stopped working due to the lack of raw materials and fuel, workers wandered in the streets, and severe food panic caused many people to bend their backs. Some could only drink one bowl of porridge a day, and some could only eat a cucumber or a tomato. At this time, when the people of Dalian and Lüshun were in the most difficult situation, the Soviet military headquarters transported 30,000 tons of grain, which was almost free relief, and distributed it to the people of Dalian and Lüshun (market price was 280 yuan per jin, and the Soviet army only charged 10 yuan per jin), allowing the hungry people in severe food shortage to overcome the difficulties. Subsequently, a fishing net factory was organized to solve the employment and livelihood problems of tens of thousands of people. Looking back at the situation in the Soviet Union at that time, we can know how self-sacrificing this friendly assistance was. At that time, it was only one year after the Soviet Union defeated the German invaders. The serious damage caused by the German invaders to the Soviet Union had not yet recovered, and it encountered an unprecedented drought. The Soviet people also urgently needed food. Under the circumstances, they provided such a large amount of food assistance to the people of Dalian and Lüshun; in the highly industrialized Soviet Union, which did not need hand-woven fishing nets at all, they organized hand-woven fishing net factories for tens of thousands of people.
　　In 1947, after the Soviet army helped the people of Dalian and Lüshun overcome the severe food shortage, when it became possible to restore the industry of Dalian and Lüshun after the People's Liberation Army smashed the blockade of the Kuomintang army on the land to the north, the Soviet army vigorously supported the restoration of the industry of Dalian and Lüshun. First of all, the Soviet comrades painstakingly, tirelessly, and hand-in-hand cultivated skilled workers, because without skilled workers, it would be impossible to build modern industry. It just so happened that Dalian and Lüshun did not have their own skilled workers - the Japanese invaders did not allow Chinese workers to learn technology! In the past three years, Soviet comrades have used methods such as running training courses, technical schools, and personally teaching apprentices to train 312 workers to be factory directors, 183 to be directors and ministers, and 534 to be section chiefs. 2,740 industrial model workers and meritorious workers have emerged, and more than 14,000 workers have initially mastered specialized technologies. Subsequently, the Soviet Union transported more than 100 of the latest machine tools to equip the industry of Dalian and Lüshun, and spread the scientific management methods of the Soviet Union's people's industry construction for more than 30 years to Dalian and Lüshun. Since learning and applying the advanced methods of Soviet industrial management, such as the seven-level wage system, economic accounting, collective contracts, rationalization proposals... the industry of Dalian and Lüshun has developed normally. According to statistics from 18 factories in the first half of this year, the production plan was exceeded by 22 percent, and major factories such as shipyards exceeded the task in the third quarter.
　　The Soviet army's assistance to agricultural production in Dalian and Lüshun, like its assistance to other democratic construction undertakings, is equally enormous. Since defeating the Japanese invaders and liberating Northeast China and Dalian and Lüshun in 1945, in order to prevent the resurgence of Japanese imperialism and defend peace in the Far East (for four years, the Soviet army has gloriously completed this task and will continue to successfully complete it, which is the greatest assistance to Dalian and Lüshun and the people of the whole country.), after stationing troops in the Lushun area in accordance with the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance, whether it is spring plowing, summer weeding, or autumn harvest, we can see the Soviet army helping farmers produce autumn harvest like the People's Liberation Army. This year, when Dalian and Lüshun promoted special crops in coordination with national industrial production, seeds were difficult to obtain, and the Soviet military headquarters gave the greatest assistance. According to a survey in Dalian County, the special crop seeds lent by the Soviet army without interest accounted for 90 percent of its sown area. In March this year, 1,000 tons of high-quality white-skinned potato seeds were given free of charge, and nearly 1,500 tons of fertilizer powder were transported in March and April to help solve the fertilizer difficulties of farmers. When there was a drought this spring, the Soviet army used trucks to carry water to irrigate the land for farmers. When insect pests were found in Jin County and other places, the Soviet army used airplanes to spray medicine to eliminate the insect pests... It is precisely because of this that the total annual agricultural production in the entire region has jumped from 120,000 tons in the Japanese era to 208,000 tons last year, changing the phenomenon that Dalian and Lüshun have always relied on external food supply and becoming a region where food can almost be self-sufficient.
　　With the restoration and development of industry and agriculture, the people demand a richer cultural life. For four years, the Soviet military headquarters stationed in Dalian and Lüshun has not only brought in and screened films that defended the socialist motherland and built a happy life, but also donated many movie projectors to Dalian and Lüshun. 350,000 copies of Marxist-Leninist and other books with rich educational significance were transported; the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries regularly sent 120 kinds of books and magazines to the Dalian and Lüshun Sino-Soviet Friendship Association; and donated a complete set of physics and chemistry teaching instruments to Lushun Middle School... These have given the people who have suffered from the long-term enslavement education of the Japanese invaders great encouragement and benefit, and greatly improved the people's cultural life and ideological awareness.
　　The Soviet army is infinitely concerned about the health of the people of Dalian and Lüshun. When plague was discovered in the winter of 1947, the Soviet army helped to form an epidemic prevention committee, which quickly put the plague down. Last year, when cholera prevention was carried out in the whole region, the Soviet Union gave 600 pounds of alcohol and 250 pounds of absorbent cotton free of charge. In order to protect the health of the people of the whole region, five large-scale Sino-Soviet hospitals were established in Lushun, Dalian, San Shi Li Bao, Shihe and other places. In these hospitals, there are not only highly skilled Soviet doctors and cheap and effective medicines, but also deeds of friendship happen every day. In the Dalian Sino-Soviet Hospital, Soviet doctor Comrade Liebin transfused 120 grams of fresh blood to urgently rescue a student. All Soviet doctors and nurses have tested their blood types and formed a blood transfusion team, ready to transfuse blood to patients who need blood transfusions at any time. In the Japanese era, Chinese people were forced to transfuse blood to Japanese robbers. Today, the Soviet people, the Soviet people educated and cultivated by Comrades Lenin and Stalin, use their own blood to save the Chinese people and restore the Chinese people to health.
　　In the past, the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people was hindered by the Chinese reactionaries, but the Soviet Union still provided us with as much assistance as possible. Now, the Chinese people's own country has been born, and the Soviet Union was the first to establish diplomatic relations with us - this marks the beginning of new and great direct assistance to the Chinese people.
　　The friendship of the people of Dalian and Lüshun towards their liberator, the great socialist Soviet Union and its heroic Red Army is growing day by day. They affectionately call the Soviet comrades "Big Brother". They hang the huge statues of Lenin and Stalin side by side with their own leader Chairman Mao in their residences, classrooms, offices and all important places. They diligently and humbly learn from the experience of the big brother in building the country, and quickly make the great motherland stronger, so as to more effectively defend world peace and build a happy life for mankind under the leadership of the Soviet Union.

　　苏军在大旅

    “苏联人民是在伟大的列宁斯大林的教育培养下的人民，这种人民对我们中国人民以至全世界人民具有无限真诚的国际主义友爱的，他们对中国人民的帮助是无条件的，不要求报酬的。”这是刘少奇同志在全国中苏友好协会成立大会上的讲话，旅大人民对它是体验深刻的。四年来，旅大人民就生活在这种真诚的国际主义的友爱中。旅大地区各种民主建设事业，在苏军无条件的不要任何报酬的援助下，迅速医治了日寇遗留给旅大人民的深痛创伤，渡过了蒋美反动派的严重封锁时期而欣欣向荣了。现在旅大已没有乞丐、没有妓女、没有小偷、并且基本上消灭了失业现象，到明年年底，两年建设计划完成时，也将基本上消灭文盲。工业建设正在向着超越日寇的最高水平猛进，中长路、玻璃工厂等许多企业已经超越它了。日寇时代不能制造的电气炉、化学工业必需的瓦斯管及好多其他产品，这里已经制造出来并源源生产了。日寇时代没有的工业和工厂，旅大已经建立起来，并继续兴建着。农业生产量，到去年已经达到四五年——日寇统治最后一年生产量的百分之一百七十三。建立起新的大学和中学，小学普遍了每一个偏僻的乡村……。
    四年来，按照中苏友好同盟条约，驻在旅大地区的苏联红军，在其驻军司令部直接领导下对于旅大人民的帮助是无微不至，面面俱到的。一九四六年，旅大刚解放不久，与全国人民为敌的蒋美反动派，就从陆上和海上严密封锁了旅大，工厂因得不到原料和燃料停了工，工人们流浪在街头，严重的粮食恐慌使很多人的脊背湾下来，有的只能一天喝到一顿稀饭，有的甚至只能吃到一根黄瓜或一个洋柿子。就在这个时候，在旅大人民最困难的时候，苏军司令部运来三万吨粮食，几乎是无代价的救济，配给给旅大人民（市价二八○元一斤，苏军只收十元钱一斤），使处在严重粮荒中的饥饿人民，渡过了难关，随后又组织了渔网工厂，解决了数万人的就业与生活问题。回想一下当时苏联的情形，就知道这种友谊的援助达到了怎样自我牺牲的程度，那时是苏联击败了德寇刚刚一年，德寇给予苏联的严重破坏尚未平复，又遇到了空前的旱灾，苏联人民同样迫切需要粮食的情况下，拿出这样大量的粮食援助旅大人民的；是在高度工业化了的苏联完全不需要手工织的渔网情况下，组织数万人的手工渔网工厂的。
    四七年，当苏军帮助旅大人民渡过了严重粮慌之后，当人民解放军粉碎了北面陆地上国民党军队封锁之后，恢复旅大工业成为可能时，苏军便大力扶助恢复旅大工业了。苏联同志首先苦心的、永不疲倦的、把着手教的培养技术工人，因为没有技术工人，想建设现代化的工业是不可能的。恰恰旅大就没有自己的技术工人——日寇时代不允许中国工人学技术啊！三年来，苏联同志用办训练班、技术学校、亲手教带徒弟等办法，培养出三一二名工人当了厂长，一八三人作了主任和部长，五三四人当了科股长，涌现出二、七四○名工业模范和功臣，有一万四千多名工友初步掌握了专门技术。随后苏联又运来百部以上最新式的工作母机，装备了旅大工业，并将三十余年来苏联建设人民工业的科学管理方法传播给旅大，自从学习和运用了苏联工业管理的先进方法，如七级工资制、经济核算、集体合同、合理化建议……之后，旅大工业便正常的向前发展了。今年前半年据十八个工厂统计，超过生产计划百分之二十二，第三季据船渠等主要工厂又都超过了任务。
    苏军对于旅大农业生产的帮助，和对其他民主建设事业一样，同样是巨大的。自从四五年击溃日寇解放东北和旅大之后，为着防止日帝国主义再起和捍卫远东和平（四年来苏军光荣的完成了这个任务，并将继续胜利完成着，这是对旅大对全国人民最大的援助。）按照中苏友好同盟条约进驻旅顺地区之后，无论是春耕、夏耘、秋收，都可以看到苏军和人民解放军一样的帮助农民生产秋收。今年旅大为配合全国工业生产推行特种作物时，种子困难，苏军司令部又给了最大的援助，仅据大连县调查，苏军无利贷给的特种作物种子即达其播种量的百分之九十。今年三月，更无代价的送给一千吨优良的白皮土豆种，三、四月间还运来肥田粉近一千五百吨，帮助解决农民的肥料困难。今春天旱时苏军用汽车拉水给农民浇地，金县等地发现虫害时，苏军用飞机撒药消灭虫灾……就是这样，由日寇时代全区农业生产年产量十二万吨，至去年已一跃而至二○万八千吨，改变了旅大向来依靠外地供给粮食的现象，而成为粮食差不多可以自给地区了。
    随着工业和农业的恢复和发展，人民要求着更加丰富的文化生活，四年来，驻旅大苏军司令部不仅将他们捍卫社会主义祖国和建设幸福生活的影片运来演出，还赠送给旅大电影机多部。运来马列主义及其他丰富教育意义的书籍三十五万册；苏联对外文化协会经常寄给旅大中苏友好协会的书报杂志达一百二十种；并赠送给旅顺中学一套完整的理化教学仪器……这些都给了遭受日寇长期奴化教育的人民以莫大的鼓舞和教益，大大提高了人民的文化生活和思想觉悟。
    苏军对于旅大人民的健康是无限关怀的，四七年冬发现鼠疫，苏军帮助组成防疫委员会，使鼠疫迅速平息下去。去年全区进行霍乱防疫时，苏联无代价的送给六百磅酒精和二百五十磅药棉。为着保卫全区人民的健康，在旅顺、大连、三十里堡、石河等地设了五所规模宏大的中苏医院，这些医院里，不仅有技术高明的苏联医生和低价良药，友谊的事迹更天天发生，在大连中苏医院里，苏联医生列宾同志，为急救一个学生，输出一百二十格兰姆鲜血。全体苏联医生和护士都检验了自己的血型，组成输血队，准备随时给需要输血的病人输血，日寇时代，是强迫中国人民输血给日本强盗，今天，苏联人民，在列宁斯大林同志教育培养下的苏联人民以自己的血，救中国人，使中国人民恢复健康了。
    在过去，中苏人民的友谊被中国反动派阻挠着，苏联还是尽可能地援助了我们。现在，中国人民自己的国家业已诞生，苏联又第一个与我建立了外交关系—这标志着新的巨大的对中国人民的直接援助开始了。
    旅大人民对于自己的解放者，伟大社会主义苏联及其英勇红军的友谊是与日俱增的。他们亲热的称呼苏联同志为“老大哥”，他们将列宁斯大林的巨像同自己领袖毛主席并排的悬挂在自己的住室、课堂、办公厅和一切重要的地方。他们勤奋虚心的向老大哥学习建国经验，迅速使伟大祖国更强盛起来，以便在苏联领导之下，更有效的保卫世界和平，建设人类的幸福生活。
