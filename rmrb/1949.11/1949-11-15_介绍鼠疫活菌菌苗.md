Introducing Live Attenuated Plague Vaccine
Tang Feifan

Plague is one of the most dangerous infectious diseases, with an especially high mortality rate. However, patients who manage to survive the disease become immune to it afterwards. In other words, this is a manifestation of immunity or resistance. Based on this principle, since Kitasato and Yersin discovered the plague pathogen in 1894, people have been trying to artificially immunize against plague. According to immunological principles, artificial immunization can utilize several things for injection. In the case of plague, the most important are two types:

① Ordinary vaccine or killed vaccine - Highly virulent plague bacilli are killed with formalin or heat at 55 degrees Celsius, diluted in physiological saline to form a suspension containing 2 billion bacteria per cubic centimeter, and preservatives are added.

② Non-toxic live bacteria or live vaccine - The virulence of pathogenic bacteria is eliminated by culture or other methods, and then cultured and made into a bacterial solution. Because it uses live bacteria, preservatives cannot be added. In addition, there are two important conditions: first, the non-toxic bacterial strain must be truly non-toxic and will not regain its virulence in the human body under any circumstances; second, the bacterial strain must be highly antigenic, that is, it can produce good immunity after injection into animals or humans.

Recently, the Soviet Union has made full use of live bacteria in plague prevention. According to the report of the Health Department of the Northeast Administrative Committee, the A.M. P-type strain of Pakrovskaya has been injected into more than 20,000 people in Northeast China, and the results are four to five times better than killed bacteria.

The manufacturing method of live attenuated plague vaccine that we currently use is roughly as follows: Reliable bacterial strains are cultured on agar at 37 degrees Celsius for one to two days. Then, the grown bacteria are scraped off or washed out and diluted in physiological saline to make a suspension containing 1 billion bacteria per cubic centimeter. This is our live attenuated vaccine. Before the first batch of live attenuated vaccine is issued, we will naturally conduct detailed identification of its safety and efficacy on animals (mice, rats, guinea pigs) and through culture methods. After that, each batch must undergo guinea pig injection (guinea pigs are most susceptible to plague) and safety tests before it can be issued.

The advantage of live attenuated vaccine is its high protective power, and only one injection is required. However, the disadvantage of the live attenuated vaccine we are currently manufacturing is that its validity period is too short. It must be used up within half a month after production, otherwise it is ineffective. This means that live bacteria do not live long in saline, and the vaccine is useless once the bacteria die. Secondly, because preservatives cannot be added to live attenuated vaccine, it is extremely easy to be contaminated by miscellaneous bacteria. Therefore, extra care must be taken during transportation (do not discard randomly), preservation (should be placed in the refrigerator), and especially during injection, to prevent miscellaneous bacteria from entering.

According to general experience, the reaction after injection of live attenuated vaccine is not too great. The local redness and pain may be greater than that of killed vaccine, and the whole body may experience a slight chill or fever, or headache and back pain, but it will subside in one or two days.

At present, the preliminary work of strain inspection at the Tiantan Epidemic Prevention Center has been completed, and further experiments have also been completed. We are now preparing to ask the government for instructions, and once approved, we will start manufacturing to meet the current urgent needs.

    介绍鼠疫活菌菌苗
    汤飞凡
    鼠疫是传染病中最危险的病症，死亡率特别高，但是病者如能在虎口内逃生，以后便不会再患鼠疫。换句话说，这就是免疫力或抵抗力产生的表现。根据这道理，所以自一八九四北里（Ｋｉｔａｓｃｔｏ）和杨生（Ｙｅｒｓｉｎ）发明鼠疫的病原菌以后，人们便想以人工来对鼠疫免疫。依照免疫学的原则，人工免疫可以利用好几种东西来作注射。就鼠疫来讲，最要紧的有两种：
    ①普通菌苗或死菌菌苗——即用很有毒力的鼠疫杆菌以福麻林或摄氏五十五度的热力把它杀死，稀释于生理食盐水内，使成每公撮含二十万万个菌的悬液，并加入防腐剂。
    ②无毒性的活菌或活菌菌苗——把有毒性的病原菌，用培养或其他的方法来消除其毒力，然后再来培养，制成菌液。因其是用活菌，所以不能加防腐剂，此外还有两个紧要的条件：第一，无毒性的菌种，确实是要无毒性，且在人体内无论在何情况下不会恢复其毒力；第二，这菌株必须富有抗原性，那就是说，注射动物或人体后，可以产生很好的免疫力。
    近来苏联预防鼠疫充分的利用了活菌。白（Ｐａｋｒｏｃｓｋａｙａ）氏的Ａ．Ｍ·Ｐ型菌种在我国东北注射过二万多人，据东北行政委员会卫生部的报告，其结果比较死菌要好四五倍。
    鼠疫活菌的制造，我们现时所用的方法大概如次：把可靠的菌种在洋菜上培养，于３７度Ｃ温室内一二天，然后把生长的细菌刮下，或洗出，稀释于生理食盐水内，使每公撮含菌十万万个，这就是我们的活菌菌苗。第一批活菌菌苗未发出之前，我们自然要把它的安全、功效，在动物（小鼠、大鼠、海猪）身上，加培养的方法来详细鉴定。以后每批都要经过海猪注射（海猪最容易感染鼠疫），及安全试验而后才能发出。
    活菌菌苗的好处，是它的保护力高，且只须注射一次。但是我们现时所制造的活菌疫苗，其短处是效期太短。制成后在半个月内，必须用完，否则无效。这意思是活菌在盐水内活的时候不长，菌死了菌苗就没用了。其次活菌菌苗内，因为不能加防腐剂，故极容易传染杂菌，所以搬运（不能乱丢），保存（应该放在冰箱内），特别是注射时，必须格外小心，以免杂菌侵入。
    活菌菌苗注射之后，据一般经验，反应并不会太大，局部的红痛或较死菌苗大，全身可能发一点寒热，或加头痛背酸的现象，但一二日即会退去。
    现在，天坛防疫处对于菌种检查的初步工作，业已完成，进一步的试验已亦了结，现正准备请示政府，一俟批准，即当开始制造，来供应当前的迫切需要。
