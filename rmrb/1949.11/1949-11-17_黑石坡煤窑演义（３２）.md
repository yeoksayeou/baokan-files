　　The Legend of Black Stone Slope Coal Mine (32)
    Kang Zhuo
　　Twenty-nine Discouragement
　　It turned out that not long after Da San went to the Fourth Mine, he heard that Japan had also started fighting with Britain and the United States. The Japanese devils shouted everywhere, telling people to mine more and increase production to contribute to the "Greater East Asia Holy War." Zhang Jubao in Heishipo Village also wanted to take this opportunity to run a kiln well to show "friendship" with the "Imperial Army"; it just so happened that his small earthen kiln was also flooded not long after. Therefore, he officially planned to expand Xilu's West Kiln greatly. He asked Qian Danao and Yubao to discuss it for a while, and then found Taicheng as the foreman. The West Kiln started construction again in the autumn of the following year.
　　It turned out that Taicheng was hired as a temporary foreman when Yubao opened the ventilation shaft of the West Kiln. He had never worked in a large kiln outside, but he had managed Jubao's earthen kiln for many years, and he believed that his skills were not bad. However, although Jubao trusted him, he didn't think much of his abilities and skills, and only used him as an object. He felt a little aggrieved about this, but he couldn't leave home to make a living outside, so he had to settle down and work. Now that he had taken over as the foreman, his business and prestige were greater than in the past, and he couldn't help but be a little happy. He took the opportunity to meet with Jubao and talk about his plan, and repeatedly said that he had already seen the signs when Yubao made the ventilation shaft turn into a millstone in the past... But Jubao didn't listen to any of this, and only said: "Work hard! Discuss more with Qian Danao and Yubao! Anyway, I won't treat you badly." After speaking, he sent him away.
　　He discussed it with Qian Danao and Yubao inside and out for a while, and quickly erected supporting timbers in the West Kiln, and decided to simultaneously dig three large branch tunnels to the northeast, northwest, and due north. Da San at the Fourth Mine soon heard this news! For some reason, he felt uneasy. Without saying a word to Shuancheng, he rushed back to the village. As soon as he returned to the village, he found Yubao and said, "If you make such a fuss, the West Kiln is not safe!" Yubao didn't understand what was going on, Da San said again: "It's no good going northeast or due north! That..." At this time, Qian Danao was walking over. When he saw Da San, he said, "So you're back, kid? You still owe two months of household registration donation from last year! Have you forgotten?" Da San couldn't help but feel angry and resentful. Without thinking or saying anything, he immediately turned around and strode away.
　　Da San was on his way to Yangquan when it was getting dark. He went south along the mountain slope road, his heart burning. Looking at the Yangquan Station not far below the mountain slope in front of him, he saw that the terrain was much larger than in the past. In the past, this was just a small town between the north and south mountains, with not many houses. Now the houses were built densely. To the west of the southern mountain root, six large coal mines were opened. The power plant in front of the Second Mine had bright white brick walls and chimneys. From Yangquan westward along the railway for ten miles, the red houses, white houses, chimneys, and coal mine high frame stands along the road were connected one after another. More red and white houses were built to the east, and a new cement factory and brick kiln factory were also built. The Yangquan Iron Factory, near the northern mountain root, had four large boilers towering into the sky. Next to the iron smelting furnace was also a porcelain kiln factory. A total of two to three thousand workers were working here every day. Further west from here, near the iron factory's water pump, a large area of newly built white barracks was surrounded by layers of trees, which was really neat and beautiful! Suddenly, the siren for the end of work at the iron factory "wooed." Da San stood still and stared ahead again. He saw that the setting sun was shining blood red on Yangquan. He remembered: This world is occupied by Japanese foreign devils! He couldn't help shivering and ran back to the Fourth Mine dormitory in one breath to sleep, and didn't go to work the night shift.
　　It turned out that Shuancheng couldn't find Da San when he went to work the night shift, and he was very flustered. The next day, when the two met, Shuancheng hurriedly asked: "Where did you go yesterday afternoon?" Da San didn't answer, but stared with his round eyes and asked: "Shuancheng! Who is that person at the mine who looks like Lao Bai? Can't we see him?" It turned out that after the two came to the Fourth Mine, Shuancheng had never let Da San see the person who had contact with the mountains. Shuancheng had also explained that people were afraid of knowing too many people and leaking information, so they didn't want to deal with many people. Now that Da San asked about this again, Shuancheng estimated that he must have something unpleasant again, and it was useless to persuade him anyway, so he went to rest on the side.
　　After that, Da San silently did his job, drank some wine, and sometimes went to the station to find some woman to spend the night. He didn't care much about his work, and didn't get enthusiastic when he met someone with strong skills. He didn't talk much to anyone, and didn't interact much with Shuancheng, as if he were stupid. Soon, he heard that the West Kiln of Heishipo was doing pretty well, but he didn't say anything. Later, he heard that the West Kiln was also flooded, and the water came out of the northwest wall, but he still didn't say anything. He never returned to the village again, and stayed depressed until the Japanese surrendered, then he got a little more energy.

　　Thirty Despair
　　It turned out that when the Japanese surrendered, the world was really in chaos. Shuancheng waved his hand and hurried back to the village, but Da San stayed at the mine for a few days, looked at the machines and saw that they were not damaged, and looked at the Japanese devils' panic, before returning to the village.
　　When Da San returned to the village, he saw that the village was also a bit lively. A pile of people were again gathering at the bottom of the theater stage to cause trouble, and Xiao Yanggui and the Liugou family were laughing and joking again. Da San nodded his head to the people as a greeting and hurried to look for Shuancheng, but couldn't find him. He ran into Bian Xiao, and when he asked, Bian Xiao only said that he had seen him early in the morning. Da San incidentally asked about Jubao and Qian Danao, but Bian Xiao pulled him to a secluded place and said, "They were also scared for those two days. These days, they've heard that it's okay again. Haven't you seen? Niu Bao went to Yangquan last year to serve in the Japanese police guard? Even he has returned to the village swaggering! Who knows what's going on!" When Da San heard this, he became even more anxious and couldn't help but leave Bian Xiao to look for Shuancheng again, but he still couldn't find him. He walked to the entrance of the large kiln field and saw Tianlu standing at the entrance of the kiln. He asked, "Second Brother, have you seen Shuancheng?" Tianlu said, "I haven't seen him. Third Brother, look, now that the Japanese have been defeated, and Old Lord has not caused trouble for many years, maybe our kiln can still work! Otherwise, it's still not working!" Da San couldn't help but feel a movement in his heart, so he stayed to check it out and turned back to say, "The kiln may still work! But the things are so badly damaged and both kilns are flooded, it's hard to pick up! Sigh! Damned Jubao, this traitorous dog, has ruined the kiln like this, will he still spend money to fix it? Even if it's given back to Xilu! I'm afraid he can't come up with the deposit! What's there to hope for!" Tianlu said, "As long as we properly respect Old Lord, and meet a good year, maybe we can owe less money in the future. Even if we share the stock and do white work without making money, we have to drain the water! Alas, how many in this village are not working! Who isn't worried all day long?" Da San said, "That's right. Which kiln worker doesn't want to work! It depends on what the rules of this world will change in the future!" Saying this, the two brothers went back to the earthen cave on the south slope outside the village.
　　Shuancheng didn't return until night. As soon as he saw Da San, he said, "I saw Lao Bai!" Da San stared at Shuancheng, and Shuancheng said again: "He came to our village a few days ago, and Lin Bao and I saw him. He also asked about you! Why didn't you come back sooner?" Da San said, "Lao Bai? Where... where is he?" Shuancheng told him: Lao Bai was working in the Eighth Route Army's Pingding County Trade Union, and said that the Eighth Route Army had arrived in Yinying, but Yan Xishan had become a traitor and sent troops down again. The Eighth Route Army was temporarily afraid that they could not come here, and Lao Bai said that the Eighth Route Army would come to rescue this place sooner or later, and told people to be patient and wait. Da San said, "Still waiting? The Eighth Route Army can't come down to beat that damned Yan Xishan?" Even Shuancheng couldn't make this clear. Da San was very discouraged, and walked back and forth in the kiln with his hands in his pockets, thinking: I must go to Yinying tomorrow to find Lao Bai.
　　But the next day, guns and cannons were firing everywhere, and Da San couldn't go to Yinying. Immediately afterwards, it was heard that "Governor Yan's" "Chinese troops" had "revived" and returned! Sure enough! Not two days later, Jubao's second son led a few soldiers back to Heishipo, and it was Qian Danao and Yubao who shouted for the whole village to go to the bottom of the theater stage to hold a meeting; Jubao's second son spoke to the people, saying something about peace, the revival of China, "Governor Yan" now being called "Officer Yan," the "Communist bandits" wanting to beat "Officer Yan," and also saying that Officer Yan had brought back a "Treasure Pot" for the people... Jubao's second son left for Yangquan after the meeting, but a "Residential Village" was established in the village, with Qian Danao as the village chief; and it was also heard that a "Governance Village" was established in Baiquan, and the Residential Village was under the jurisdiction of the Governance Village... People couldn't figure out what was going on. Once, a group of people were idly gathered at the bottom of the theater stage to make trouble, and everyone was talking about the "Treasure Pot." The Liugou family said: "Maybe Officer Yan brought some kind of pot back for old man Jubao!" Xiao Yanggui said: "No! What pot does old man Jubao lack! In my opinion, maybe Officer Yan saw that we have suffered these years and will give each person a pot with everything we want in it. That's called a Treasure Pot!" The Liugou family said: "Xiao Yanggui! If that's the case, you, this foreign devil, have surrendered, so this pot isn't for you!" Xiao Yanggui said: "If it's not for me, it's always for you! I'll give you a big one, and you can ask for a man in the pot!" The Liugou family hurriedly swung her dry tobacco pouch and beat and scolded him; but few people nearby were laughing; everyone was full of worries, worrying about whether it would be joy or disaster in the future.

　　黑石坡煤窑演义（３２）
    康濯
  　二十九　灰心
    却说大三去四矿不久，就听说日本跟英国美国也开了仗，日本鬼子到处乱嚷：叫人们多开矿多增产，来供献给“大东亚圣战”。这边黑石坡村张聚宝，也就想趁这机会好好闹个窑，表示跟“皇军”“亲善”；恰好他的小土窑不久也被水淹了，于是，他便正式盘算着要把喜禄的西口窑往大里扩展。他让乾大脑和玉宝合计了一阵，又找了泰成当领事，第二年秋天，西窑就又动工了。
    却说泰成这人就是玉宝开西窑透风筒时候给当闲工头的，他没有出外下过大窑，但却给聚宝经管了多年土窑，自认把式不赖，不过聚宝虽说信得过他这人，却不大看重他的能耐和把式，只把他当个物件使唤；他对这也觉着有点委屈，但他又不能撂开家出去混，也只得安心干下来。现在他接了这个领事，营生和排场都比他过去的大，他不免也高兴了些，并趁机去见了见聚宝，说了一套他的计划，还一再说过去玉宝透风筒转了磨道那回，他实在是早就看出了苗头的……聚宝却听不进这些，只道：“你好好干吧！多跟乾大脑玉宝商议！反正我错待不了你。”说完就打发他走了。
    他又里里外外跟乾大脑和玉宝计议了一阵，就很快在西窑支起了顶木，并拿定主意，往东北、西北、正北同时刨开了三条大岔道。这讯息，四矿的大三很快就听说了！他不知怎么只觉坐立不安，也没跟拴成说一声，就一股劲跑回了村，一回村就寻见玉宝说：“你们那么闹腾，那西窑可不保险啊！”玉宝没闹清是怎么回事，大三又说：“往东北正北都不行！那……”这时乾大脑正走来，他一见大三就说：“你小子回啦？你去年还欠着俩月户口捐没掏哩！莫非忘球了？”大三不禁气火扪心，什么也没想，什么也没说，立时就掉转头大步走了。
    大三往阳泉走的时候，天气快到傍黑。他顺山坡大道一直往南，心中火辣辣地，一边望着前面不远山坡下面的阳泉站，只见这地势比过去大得多：过去这里不过是南北两山中间的一个小镇子，并没多少人家；现在房子盖得挤密密地，靠南山根往西，开了六个大煤矿，二矿前面的发电厂，砖墙和烟囱白亮亮地；从阳泉顺铁路往西十来里地，沿路的红房子、白房子、烟囱和煤矿高车大架连着接着；往东盖的红白房子更多，还新立了洋灰厂和砖窑厂；靠北山根这边的阳泉铁厂，四个大锅炉耸到半天空里，熔铁炉旁边还有瓷窑厂，这里每日一共动弹两三千号工人；从这再往西，在铁厂的水泵那边，一大片新盖起的白兵营房，被围在一层层的树木下面，实在整齐好看！忽然铁厂下班的汽笛“呜呜”叫了，大三立下来，瞪着两眼再向前望，只见快要落山的太阳，把阳泉照得血红血红地。他想起来：这天下是＠他妈日本洋鬼占着的呀！他不由的打了个冷颤，就一口气跑回四矿宿舍睡下，夜班也不去上了。
    却说拴成到上夜班的时候，寻不见大三，很有些心慌；第二天二人见面，拴成忙问：“昨儿后晌你去哪里呀？”大三却不回话，只瞪着大圆眼反问道：“拴成！你说矿上那象老白的人是谁？咱不能见见？”原来他俩来四矿以后，拴成起根就没让大三见过那个跟山里边有联络的人，拴成也解说过：说人家怕认识人多了透气走风的吃亏，不愿跟很多人打交道；现在大三又问起这，拴成估量他准是又有什么不痛快，反正打劝也不顶，就自己到一边歇着去了。
    以后大三就不声不响地干干营生，喝喝酒，有时也去站上找个什么女人宿一宿；他对营生上头也不什么操心，碰见把式强的也没过去热火，跟谁也不大说话，和拴成也交往得不多，好象傻愣傻愣地。不久，他听说黑石坡的西口大窑打整得挺不赖，他也没说什么；后来又听说那西窑也淹了，水却是从西北墙出来的，他还是没说什么。他也再没有回过村，一直闷闷地呆到日本投降，才又上点劲。
  　三十　绝望
    却说日本投降的时候，可真是天下大乱。拴成一摔手就急忙回村去了，大三却还在矿上呆了几天，看了看机器并没破坏，又看了看鬼子们的慌乱劲，才回村去。
    等大三回到村里，只见村里也热闹了些，戏楼底又围了一堆人在捣拉，小洋鬼和柳沟家也又在笑闹。大三跟人们脑袋一点打个招呼，就忙着寻拴成，却寻不见；他碰见扁小，一打问，扁小也只说大早见来着；大三顺便又问聚宝和乾大脑，扁小却把他拉到个僻静地势说：“那两天他们也怕乎乎地，这两天又听他们说是没事，你没见？牛宝不是去年去阳泉当了日本警备队？连他也回村大摇大摆了！谁知怎么闹腾的啊！”大三一听这，更急的不行，就撂开扁小又寻拴成，却还是没见。他走到大窑窑场口，只见天禄在窑口上立着，他问道：“老二，见拴成么？”天禄说：“没见。老三，你看这如今日本也败啦，老君爷也多年不闹事啦，咱这窑许还能闹吧！要不，还是没干的呀！”大三不觉也心眼一动，就呆下来察看了一下，回头说：“窑是还许能行！可糟塌得东西俩窑都淹了，也难拾掇哩！咳！＠他妈的聚宝这狗汉奸把窑毁成这样，他还会掏钱来打整？就是再给了喜禄吧！怕他也拿不出垫本来啦！这还有什么想望头啊！”天禄说：“只要咱好好敬敬老君爷，碰对个好年景的，往后差款也兴能少两个，咱就是碰股花白工不挣钱，也得给打尽水干哩！唉，这一村多少没干的啊！谁们不是整日家发愁？”大三道：“也就是。窑黑们谁不乐意干啊！就看往后这世道，规章是怎么个变吧！”说着，他弟兄俩相跟回村外南坡土窑洞里去了。
    拴成直到黑夜才回。他一见大三就说：“我见了老白！”大三瞪着眼直望拴成，拴成又道：“他前两天到咱村来着，我和林宝见了他。他还问讯你哩！你怎么不早些回？”大三道：“老白？他……他在哪里？”拴成告他：老白在八路军平定县工会里办公事，并说八路军到了荫营，可阎老西当了汉奸，又派队伍下来了，八路一时怕还不能上这来，老白说八路反正迟早要来打救这里的，叫人们再耐住性子等等。大三道：“还等？八路军不能下来打他妈阎老西？”这可连拴成也说不圆转。大三很泄气，就抄着两手在窑里来回走着，心想：明个一定要去荫营寻老白去。
    但第二天，四外乱响枪炮，大三没能去荫营。紧接着，就听说是“阎督军”的“中国队伍”又“复兴”回来了！果然！不两天，聚宝的二小领着几个兵回了黑石坡，又是乾大脑跟玉宝吆喝浑村人去戏楼底开大会；聚宝他二小给人们说话，什么和平啦、中国复兴啦、“阎督军”现在叫作“阎长官”啦、“共匪”要打“阎长官”啦，又说是阎长官给人们带回个“聚宝盆”……聚宝他二小散了会就去了阳泉，村里却成立了个什么“居村”，乾大脑的村长；又听说白泉成立了什么“治村”，居村还归治村管……人们闹不清这翻腾的是怎么回事。有一回，戏楼底围着一圪堆人闲捣拉，大伙说上了“聚宝盆”，柳沟家说：“许是阎长官给聚宝老人家捎了个什么盆吧！”小洋鬼说：“不是！聚宝老人家他还缺什么盆的！依着我说，许是阎长官见咱们受了这些年罪，给一人发个什么盆，盆里要什么有什么，这就叫聚宝盆吧！”柳沟家说：“小洋鬼！要那么着，你这洋鬼子可是投了降的，这盆可没你的份啊！”小洋鬼道：“没我的份可总有你的份呀！给你个大的，你给盆里要个男人！”柳沟家忙伸着旱烟袋又打又骂；旁边人们却没几个笑的；人们都一肚子心事，担心着往后到底是喜还是祸。
