　　80,000 Waterwheels to be Promoted Next Year
  　North China Agricultural Department Holds Symposium on Improving Waterwheel Technology
    [North China News] The Agricultural Department of the North China People's Government invited Guo Li of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, Shao Dechen of the Industrial Bureau, Professor Liu Xianzhou of Tsinghua University, and relevant iron factories in Beijing on the 31st to discuss the technical issues of waterwheel improvement. Zhang Zilin, Director of the Farmland Water Conservancy Department of the Agricultural Department, first addressed the meeting, stating: "We must promote 80,000 waterwheels next year. This is a major task. In terms of product quality, we must strive for scientific accuracy and gain widespread trust and welcome from the masses." The meeting then broadly exchanged views on the new waterwheel designed and modified from the old pipe waterwheel. The waterwheel weighs 76.7 kilograms (the old waterwheel weighed 130 kilograms) and has a discharge rate of 4.68 tons to 8.64 tons per hour. The materials used in manufacturing have been carefully planned.
    In addition, everyone believes that the seasonality of waterwheel production is very important. It was decided to complete all production tasks before May next year. The supply of raw materials and production factories will be specifically arranged by the Ministry of Heavy Industry. It was also decided to complete the first waterwheel before the Heavy Industry Conference, and then carry out large-scale production after experimentation and improvement. The meeting finally decided that the Agricultural Department, the Ministry of Heavy Industry, and the Industrial Bureau would form a waterwheel production committee to specifically grasp technical guidance and the entire production process.

　　明年推广水车八万辆
  　华北农业部座谈改良水车技术
    【华北讯】华北人民政府农业部，于三十一日下午邀请重工业部郭力、工业局邵德琛及清华大学刘仙洲教授，及京市有关铁工厂座谈水车改良技术问题，首由农业部农田水利处张子林处长致词称：我们明年必须推广八万辆水车，这是一个重大的任务，在产品上，务求科学、精确，取得群众广泛的信任和欢迎。会议就由旧管子水车设计改装的新水车，广泛交换了意见。该水车计重七六·七公斤（旧水车重一三○公斤），每小时出水量四·六八吨到八·六四吨，在制造用料上都经过详细的计划。
    此外，大家认为水车生产的季节性是很重要的，决定在明年五月前完成全部生产任务，原料供应及生产工厂由重工业部具体支配，并决定在重工业会议前完成第一架水车，实验改善后再大规模生产。会议最后决定由农业部、重工业部，及工业局三单位组成水车生产委员会，以便具体掌握技术指导及整个生产过程。
