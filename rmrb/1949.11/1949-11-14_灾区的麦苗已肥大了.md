Who can deny the power of rural women's wisdom once it is awakened? When they were asked to soak the seeds before planting during the autumn plowing, they were always afraid of spoiling the seeds and preventing them from sprouting. Explaining to them repeatedly that soaking the seeds could disinfect them, ensuring that the wheat would not get sick and that the harvest would be good next year, these propagations were not very effective. Shao Hong, the director of the Zhou Village Women's Association in the ninth district of Hejian County, first soaked a handful of wheat seeds herself, sprouted them, and took them to the meeting to show the masses. Only then did the masses have the confidence to soak the seeds, and they all automatically soaked the seeds and passed on the experience of soaking seeds to the whole village.

This year's flood was bitter enough for the people! The women in the disaster areas are busy all day long for their lives, trying every means to overcome the difficulties they face. However, because in some areas women going to the fields has not yet become a habit, they do not pick the wild vegetables that are everywhere to eat. A district cadre from Wang Guantun Village in Cang County picked some wild vegetables, mixed them with coarse grain flour, and made pancakes for the village cadres to taste together. The taste was acceptable, so he introduced the types of vegetables and how to eat them to the village. Only then did the women know that wild vegetables could be used as substitutes for food, but they were still embarrassed to go to the fields to pick them. When Shi Xiuhua from Wang Guantun Village first went to the fields, she carried a basket and dared not walk on the street.团员 Liu Yulan carried it for her out of the village and then handed it to her. After a few days, Shi Xiuhua naturally got used to it and carried the basket to the field herself, no longer needing someone to accompany her. In four days, she picked about two to three hundred catties of fresh vegetables. The village cadres broadcast her achievements on the village radio station, and the masses in the village all discussed and said, "A seventeen-year-old girl is more capable than a young man, really great!" After being broadcast, Shi Xiuhua worked even harder from then on. The women in the whole village went to the fields to work one after another, learning from Shi Xiuhua.

Every day they picked wild vegetables, part of which was exchanged for miscellaneous grain flour or bran from people in non-disaster areas, and the rest was dried into dried vegetables. According to statistics from over ninety villages in Cang County, more than eighty percent of the women participated in the production of picking wild vegetables.

The simple rural women, after being inspired by the organized forces, have gained confidence in self-salvation through production and have been mobilized. In addition to picking substitutes for food, some are also engaged in sideline production such as braiding braids (for making straw hats). The men do some small business. At the same time, people in non-disaster areas often provide friendly support.

In the non-disaster areas, under the propaganda, education and cultivation of key members by the Communist Youth League branches and women cadres, most of them have broken the idea that women should not go to the fields. They have raised their family status from the practical action of participating in field production, and at the same time, they can consciously respond to the call for a bowl of rice movement in the autumn harvest to support the disaster areas, contributing great friendship to the people in the disaster areas. In Jianguo County, a village cadre, Lu Fengying, first donated fifty catties of millet at the joint meeting of districts and villages, and also guaranteed that she would return to the village to get all the women in the village to respond to this disaster relief appeal. Sure enough, due to her impetus, one hundred and twenty-seven women took out a total of five hundred catties of miscellaneous grains. According to statistics from sixty-one villages, this mobilization collected a total of two thousand eight hundred and eighty-odd catties of miscellaneous grains. This kind of friendly mutual assistance is the case in all counties.

This autumn, the people in the disaster areas have sown wheat seeds in their fields under the government's seed loan and through their own methods of borrowing. After sowing wheat in the autumn plowing, some of the victims fled to non-disaster areas, where they could almost all receive warm friendship, assistance and help. In the fourth district of Hejian County, there are victims living in five villages. The village cadres generally take very good care of those people, helping them find housing, borrow utensils, and solve their food problems, leading them to help others cultivate land, spin thread, or go to the fields to pick dates and gather peanuts. Therefore, the victims who have fled can still get a warm meal. In one village, Li Xiaoli's mother even invited the victims who worked for her family to eat meat together and celebrate the Mid-Autumn Festival on the fifteenth day of August. The friendship of the human class warms the hearts of the victims!

It is said that this winter the government will vigorously assist the victims in the eighth special district of Hebei Province, and will mobilize three thousand textile machines. Only the people's government truly cares about the lives of the people.

Rest assured! People in the disaster areas, your strong perseverance and wisdom have overcome the natural disasters given to people this year! Your strength has triumphed, and the seeds of hope you have planted with hardship will bring you a great harvest in the wheat season next year! Look! Aren't the patches of wheat seedlings already lush! Once the northwest wind freezes the ground, it can be pulled down and mixed with coarse grain flour to make pancakes to eat, which is a ready-made substitute for food!

People affected by the disaster, the wheat seedlings in the disaster area are already lush.

    灾区的麦苗已肥大了
    高苇
    谁能否认农村妇女们的智慧一经启发后的力量呢？当秋耕时要她们把种籽浸后再种下，她们总是怕把种籽浸坏了出不来，再三的向她们解释浸种可把种籽消毒，保证麦子不生病，明年收成好，这些宣传并没有多大的效力。河间县九区周村妇会主任邵鸿首先自己浸了一把麦种籽，出了芽拿到大会上去给群众看，群众才有了浸种的信心，都自动的浸下种籽，并以浸种的经验传到整个村子里。
    今年的水灾淹得人们够苦的！灾区的妇女们成天价为生活忙迫着，想尽办法来克服着面临的困难，但是由于有些地区对妇女下地还没成为习惯，所以遍地的野菜，也不去采来吃，沧县王官屯村一位区干部采了点野菜，掺了粗粮面，贴了饼子请村干部们共同来尝尝，味儿还可以，于是把菜的种类和吃的方法介绍到村里，妇女们才知道了野菜可作代食品，但她们还是不好意思下地去采打。王官屯村史秀花才下地时，背着筐子不敢在街上走，团员刘玉兰替她背着走出村子再交给她，几天后史秀花也就自然成习惯，自己背着筐子下地了，不再要人作伴了。在四天内，她就采打了约有二三百斤的鲜菜。村干部在村广播台广播了她的成绩，村子里的群众们听了全议论着说：“才十七岁的闺女比小伙子还能干，真行！”经过广播后的史秀花，从此干得更加劲了。全村的妇女们都先后下地干活，向史秀花看齐。
    她们每天打的野菜，一部分去向非灾区的人们换点杂粮面或糠并以剩余的晒成干菜。据沧县九十几个村的统计，即有百分之八十多的妇女参加了采打野菜的生产。
    纯朴的农村妇女，经过组织力量的启发，她们对生产自救有了信心了，动员起来了，她们除了采打代食品以外，还有的作掐辫子（做草帽用）等类的副业生产，男人们作点小买卖，同时，非灾区人们还时常给予友爱的支援。
    非灾区的妇女们，在团支部及妇女干部们的宣传教育及培养骨干之下，她们大多数人打破了妇女不下地的思想，她们从参加田间生产的实际行动中提高了自己的家庭地位，同时能自觉的在秋收中响应一碗米运动支援灾区的号召，对灾区的人们贡献出莫大的友爱。建国县，一个村干部卢凤英，在区村联席会上自己首先捐出五十斤小米，而且保证回到村子里让全村的妇女们响应这一救灾号召，果然由于他的带动，一百二十七个妇女共拿出五百斤杂粮。这次的发动，据六十一个村的统计，共收到二千八百八十几斤的杂粮。这种友情的互助，各县都有这样的情形。
    今秋灾区的人们，在政府的贷种下及自己设法借贷等办法下，已都把麦种撒到他们的地里了。有部分的灾民在秋耕种下麦子后，逃荒到非灾区去后，在那里差不多都能获得温暖的友情接济及帮助。河间县四区有五个村子里住有灾民，一般村干部对那些人们非常亲切的照顾，帮着找住处，借用具，并且代为解决吃饭问题，领着她们帮别人耕地，纺线或到地里去检枣、拾花生，因此逃去的灾民们还可以得到一餐温饱。一个村子里，李小里的母亲在八月十五的那天，还请为她家作活的灾民吃肉共同过中秋呢。人类阶级的友情温暖着灾民们的心！
    听说今冬政府要大力协助河北省第八专区的灾民们，要发动起三千架的纺织机呢。只有人民的政府，才真正的关怀着人民的生活。
    宽心吧！灾区的人们，你们坚强的毅力，智慧已战胜了今年自然给与人们的灾荒了！你们的力量胜利了，你们艰辛种下的希望的种籽，在明年麦季会给你们带来一个大丰收！瞧！一片片的麦苗不是已肥大了吗！一旦西北风刮冻了地面后，把它揪下来掺在杂粮面里做饼子吃，是现成的代食品呢！
    受灾的人们，灾区的麦苗已肥大了。
