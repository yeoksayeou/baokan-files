Plague Vaccination

Why get vaccinated? The meaning of vaccination is to inject vaccine into the human body, so that the body produces a resistance to the disease. The scientific term for this is antibody. This antibody exists in the blood. When encountering germs that are the same as this vaccine, it can eliminate them or prevent them from exerting their virulence, so you will no longer get sick. There are now two types of vaccines we use:

I. Killed Vaccine:

After injecting killed vaccine into the body, it can provide considerable immunity to glandular plague infection. However, whether it can provide immunity to primary pneumonic plague infection is questionable. Most do not recognize that it has any effect.

Injection method and dosage: All instruments used for vaccine injection must be strictly disinfected and must also be disinfected after use. Before starting the injection, first explain the meaning of injection and reaction to the masses. Collective injections can be carried out in areas where plague has not occurred. If it is in an epidemic area, it should be implemented by household. At the same time, check the body temperature as much as possible, and register everyone who has been injected in detail for statistics.

Precautions before vaccine injection: Before implementing the injection, inquire about the diseases you have suffered in the past. Those with a body temperature above 37.5 degrees Celsius, those with open pulmonary tuberculosis, severe heart disease, and pregnant women over seven months must undergo a physical examination by a doctor before deciding whether to inject.

Vaccine dosage: Adults, the first time 1 cc, the second time 1.5 cc.

For children aged eight to sixteen, each injection dose can be reduced to half of the adult dose; for children aged one to eight, the first injection dose is 0.2 cc, the second time 0.3 cc, and the third time 0.5 cc. The interval between injections is one week.

II. Live Vaccine:

This vaccine first reduces the toxin of the plague bacteria while preserving its immune properties, so that it will not cause disease when injected into the human body, but can produce a large number of antibodies. If it encounters the same bacteria, it can eliminate it.

The usage and precautions of live vaccine are as follows:

A. Dilution method—First, pay attention to whether the ampoule is damaged. If it is damaged and air enters, the bacteria will die and the injection will be ineffective. When diluting, dilute according to the amount of physiological saline recorded on the ampoule. Strict disinfection methods must be used during dilution.

B. Injection method—Injection of dry live vaccine must be performed under strict sterile conditions and under the supervision of a doctor. The diluted vaccine must be used on the same day; it is best not to exceed ten to twelve hours. Disinfect the skin before injection, and then use subcutaneous injection. The injection site is best in the lower part of the scapula or the lower part of the clavicle. Inject 1 cc each time, and one injection is sufficient.

C. Post-injection reaction—Local reactions are unavoidable, such as redness and swelling, pain, etc. This reaction occurs six to ten hours after the injection and disappears after five to eight days. Systemic reactions mainly include general discomfort, headache, increased body temperature, and sometimes vomiting; if these reactions occur on the first day, they will disappear on the second day.

D. Precautions before injection—Those who have acute infectious diseases, those with decompensated cardiac function, those with severe chronic liver and kidney diseases, those with open pulmonary tuberculosis, those with congenital dysplasia, and pregnant women are not suitable for injection.

Comparison of the effects of live vaccine and killed vaccine—The investigation in Tongliao, Northeast China, is as follows: (Attached table)
<table>
<tr>
<td>Category</td>
<td>Number of Injected Villages</td>
<td>Number of Villages with Outbreaks</td>
<td>Number of People Injected</td>
<td>Number of Cases</td>
<td>Incidence Rate (%)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Live Vaccine Injection</td>
<td>41</td>
<td>14</td>
<td>18,493</td>
<td>103</td>
<td>0.43</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Killed Vaccine Injection</td>
<td>11</td>
<td>7</td>
<td>4,441</td>
<td>122</td>
<td>1.74</td>
</tr>
</table>

From the above statistics, it can be seen that the effectiveness of killed vaccine is four times smaller than that of live vaccine. At the same time, injection of live vaccine not only reduces the incidence rate, but also has the effect of quickly stopping the spread.

The relationship between plague vaccine injection and mortality rate—According to the results of the summary of plague prevention and control work in Northeast China, among 1,222 patients, the mortality rate of those who were not injected was 84.4%, the mortality rate of those who were injected once was 81.5%, the mortality rate of those who were injected twice was 63.6%, and the mortality rate of those who were injected three times was 43%. This statistic proves that after vaccination, the number of people who get the plague will naturally decrease, and the mortality rate of plague patients will also decrease. Therefore, the mortality rate is inversely proportional to the number of vaccinations, that is, the more vaccinations, the more thorough the prevention, and the smaller the mortality rate.

### 鼠疫的预防注射

　　鼠疫的预防注射
    为什么要打预防针？预防注射的意义，就是将菌苗注射到人体内，使身体产生一种抵抗疾病的东西，科学名词叫抗体，这种抗体存在于血液中，遇着有和这种菌苗相同的病菌，就能把它消灭或使它不能发挥毒力作用，不再生病。现在我们所用的菌苗有两种：
    一、死菌苗：
    身体内注射死菌苗后，对腺鼠疫之感染能有相当的免疫性，而对原发性肺鼠疫之感染是否能有免疫则属疑问，大多数不承认其有何效果。
    注射法及注射量：注射疫苗时所使用之一切器械，必须严密消毒，用后也须消毒。在开始注射之前，首先须向群众解释注射及反应之意义，在未发生鼠疫的区域可行集体注射，若在疫区内时，则应按户施行。同时尽可能检查体温，对一切注射过的人，必须详细登记以便统计。
    疫苗注射前之注意事项：在实行注射前，应询问过去患过何种疾病，凡体温在三十七度五以上者，有开放性肺结核，重心脏病，七个月以上孕妇者均须经医生检查体格再决定注射。
    疫苗注射量：成人第一次一西西，第二次一个半西西。
    小儿年龄由八岁到十六岁者，每次注射量，可减至成人之半；一岁到八岁之小儿第一次注射量为○·二西西，第二次○·三西西，第三次为○·五西西。注射之间隔日期为一星期。
    二、生菌苗：
    此种菌苗系先把鼠疫细菌毒素减低而保存其免疫性质，使之注射到人体内不致发病，但能产生大量抗体，如遇到相同的病菌，就能将它消灭。
    生菌苗的用法及注意事项如下：
    甲、稀释法——首先注意安瓿是否破损，如有破损空气进入，则菌体死灭注射亦无效。稀释时须按安瓿上所记载的生理食盐水量稀释之。稀释时完全要用严密的消毒方法实行之。
    乙、注射方法——注射干燥生菌苗，须在严密的无菌条件下和医生的监视下施行。已经稀释好的菌苗须当天使用；最好不得超过十到十二小时。注射时先将皮肤消毒，后用皮下注射法施行。注射部位最好是肩胛骨下部或锁骨下部。每次注射一西西，注射一次即可。
    丙、注射后的反应——局部反应是不能避免的，如红肿、疼痛等，此反应于注射后六到十小时发生，经五到八天后消失。全身反应，主要是全身不适、头痛、体温上升、有时呕吐；此等反应如于第一天发生时，于第二天即消失。
    丁、注射前的注意事项——凡患急性传染病，心脏机能代偿作用失调者，重症慢性肝肾疾患，开放性肺结核，先天发育不良者以及孕妇等均不适于注射。
    生菌苗和死菌疫苗的效果比较——东北通辽的调查如下：（附图表）类别　注射村数　发生村数　注射人数　发病人数　发生率（％）菌别生菌注射　四一　一四　一八、四九三　一○三　○·四三死菌注射　一一　七　四、四四一　一二二　一·七四
    由以上统计得知，死菌的效力比生菌苗的效力要小四倍，同时注射生菌苗不仅减低发生率，且有迅速停止传播的功效。
    鼠疫菌苗注射与死亡率之关系——据东北防治鼠疫工作总结中的结果，患者一二二二名，未经注射者的死亡率为百分之八四·四，注射疫苗一次的死亡率为百分之八一·五，注射二次的为百分之六三·六，注射三次的为百分之四三。由于这个统计可以证明注射疫苗后，得鼠疫的当然要减少，而鼠疫患者的死亡率也同样减低。因此死亡率大小与预防注射的次数成反比例，即注射次数愈多预防的愈彻底则死亡率也愈小。
