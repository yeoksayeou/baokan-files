　　Oppose the Dogmatic Learning Method
    Tian Min
    When I was in university, I greatly admired the "scholars" who devoured thick, foreign books. When I read Marxist-Leninist works myself, I also thought the thicker the better, memorizing all the clauses and sentences, while my actual actions were often something else entirely. Sometimes, I didn't even know the actual meaning of the sentences in the books. This was a serious dogmatic learning method, and needless to say, it was worthless.
    Later, I learned that I should oppose dogmatic learning. I heard many comrades say that dogmatists all chew on big books, so I thought that reading big books of Marxist-Leninist original works was dogmatism, and dogmatic learning was chewing on big books. Therefore, I kicked aside big books and didn't read them, considering reading Marxist-Leninist original works as forbidden. When I saw others reading Marxist-Leninist original works, I laughed at them as bookworms and dogmatists. Of course, reading pamphlets is also necessary, but when learning these pamphlets, I still memorized the doctrines by rote, without trying to understand the spirit and essence of them. Therefore, I still learned one thing and did another.
    Using this method to oppose dogmatism, the result is still dogmatism, even taking many detours, which is obviously incorrect.
    Recently, while studying the history of social development, I found that this situation still exists. Some young students who have just come out of school chew on big books, memorize doctrines by rote, and do not have correct learning methods, but some cadres who guide learning simply tell them not to chew on big books, saying: "You are all dogmatists, chewing on big books every day." So the students put down the big books and didn't chew on them, only reading pamphlets, thinking that dogmatism would never return. But in fact, the dogmatic learning method has not changed at all. They still don't understand that learning theory is to guide practical work, and they still don't know that they should learn the position, viewpoint, and method of Marxism-Leninism in practical application, only thinking that not chewing on big books and not reading Marxist-Leninist original works is not dogmatism.
    In the current upsurge of learning Marxist-Leninist theory, we must oppose the deeply rooted dogmatic learning method that exists among intellectuals in the past. We must oppose the pedantic practice of chewing on big books as the only learning method and being satisfied with memorizing the doctrines and sentences in the books, because this learning method itself violates Marxism-Leninism. But the situation mentioned above is also worthy of attention. We must correctly oppose dogmatism, instead of formally thinking that opposing chewing on big books is opposing dogmatism. This method itself is a dogmatic practice.
    We must clarify the real dividing line between dogmatism and the correct learning method. This dividing line is not whether to read "big books" and chew on big, profound Marxist-Leninist original works. On the contrary, we must know that these works by Marx, Engels, and Lenin are precisely the profound attainments of Marxism-Leninism, and are the best examples of opposing the dogmatic thinking method of disconnecting theory from practice. In *State and Revolution*, Lenin described how Marx accurately examined French history and enriched the Marxist theory of the state from the actual lessons of the Paris Commune in 1871; and this theory guided the subsequent proletarian revolutionary movement. This is a brilliant example of the combination of Marxist-Leninist theory and practice. The great works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, and Chairman Mao are full of countless such brilliant examples, telling us the position, viewpoint, and method of Marxism-Leninism in observing practical problems and handling practical problems, and these are exactly what we urgently need to learn.
    The real dividing line between dogmatism and the correct learning method lies in whether we are satisfied with memorizing doctrines and sentences when studying these books? Or do we not only remember the laws and conclusions that Marxism-Leninism has reached on certain individual issues, but more importantly, learn how they use correct positions, viewpoints, and methods in actual revolutions, and how they draw various different or even opposite conclusions under different times, conditions, and locations, so that in dealing with our current practical struggles, we can learn to use correct positions, viewpoints, and methods, and learn to proceed from reality (that is, specific time, conditions, and locations), rather than from principles and doctrines.
    In the current learning, under possible conditions, it is still necessary to read Marxist-Leninist original works that one's level can understand. Thinking that reading them is dogmatism is a thought that needs to be corrected. But this certainly does not mean that we can underestimate pamphlets. We must also oppose the tendency to underestimate pamphlets. We must clearly define that learning theory is to learn the position, viewpoint, and method of Marxism-Leninism. It is incorrect to formally raise questions based on the "size" of books. In this way, we can better promote the study of Marxist-Leninist theory further.

### 反对教条主义的学习方法

　　反对教条主义的学习方法
    田敏
    在大学里念书的时候，非常崇拜啃洋装大本的“学者”；自己读马列主义著作的时候，也是越厚越好，把里面的条文字句都背熟，而实际行动却常常是另外一套。有时候甚至连书中文句的实际意义都不知道。这是严重的教条主义学习方法，不用说，是一钱不值。
    后来，知道应该反对教条主义的学习。听许多同志说，教条主义者都啃大本，便以为读大本的马列主义原著便是教条主义，而教条主义学习便是啃大本。因此，便踢开大本书不读，以读马列原著为犯禁。看见别人读马列主义原著，便笑他书呆子、教条主义。当然，看小册子也是应当的，但在学这些小册子时，仍然死背教条，不去体会其中的精神与实质，因此，还是学的一套，做的另一套。
    用这样的方法来反对教条主义，其结果仍然是教条主义，以至走了许多弯路，显然是不正确的。
    最近在学习社会发展史的时候，发现这样的情形依然存在。有些新从学校出来的青年学生，啃大本，背教条，没有正确的学习方法，但有些指导学习的干部，却简单地叫他们不啃大本，说：“你们都是教条主义，天天啃大本。”于是学生们便放下大本不啃，单看小册子，以为从此教条主义便一去不返。但其实，教条主义的学习方法却丝毫未变，他们依然没懂得学理论是为了指导实际工作，也仍然不知道应该学习马列主义在实际运用中的立场、观点、方法，只以为不啃大本，不读马列主义原著，便不是教条主义了。
    在目前学习马列主义理论的高潮中，我们必须反对过去在知识分子中存在的根深蒂固的教条主义的学习方法，我们必须反对以死啃大本为唯一学习方法，以背熟书上的教条、文句为满足的迂儒的做法，因为这种学习方法本身便是违反马列主义的。但上面所说的这种情形，也是值得注意的，我们必须正确地反对教条主义，而不是形式地以为反对啃大本便是反对教条主义，这样的方法本身又便是教条主义的做法。
    必须搞清教条主义与正确的学习方法之间的真正分界线，这一条分界线不在于是否读“大本书”、啃大本深奥的马列主义原著。相反地，要知道马恩列斯的这些著作，正是马列主义的高深的造诣，是反对理论与实际脱节的教条主义思想方法的最好范例。列宁在国家与革命一书中，叙述马克思如何确切地考察法国历史，从一八七一年巴黎公社的实际教训中，充实了马克思主义关于国家学说的理论；而这种理论，又指导了后来的无产阶级革命运动。这便是马列主义理论与实际结合的一个光辉范例。马、恩、列、斯及毛主席的巨著中，充满了无数这样光辉的范例，告诉了我们马列主义观察实际问题、处理实际问题的立场、观点与方法，而这些正是我们迫切要学的。
    教条主义与正确的学习方法之间的真正界线，在于我们在学习这些书籍的时候，是以背教条、背文句为满足呢？还是不仅记得马列主义在某些个别问题上得出的规律与结论，而是更着重的学习他们如何在实际的革命中运用正确的立场、观点方法，如何在不同的时间、条件、地点之下，得出各种不同的甚至相反的结论，因而在处理我们当前的实际斗争中学会运用正确的立场、观点、方法，学会从实际（即具体的时间条件地点）出发，而不是从原则教条出发。
    在当前的学习当中，在可能的条件下，读自己水平所能了解的马列主义的原著还是必要的，以为读它们便是教条主义，这种想法是要纠正的，但这当然并不是说，可以轻视小册子，我们也要反对轻视小册子的偏向，必须明确学习理论是学习马列主义的立场、观点、方法，一切以书本的“大”“小”来形式主义地提出问题，都是不正确的。这样，我们可以把马列主义理论的学习更好地向前推进一步。
