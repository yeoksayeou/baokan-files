Xue Zizheng, the Secretary-General of the First People's Representative Conference of All Circles Negotiation Committee, announced the opening of the meeting and unanimously approved the list of the presidium, the chairman, vice-chairmen, and secretary-general of the presidium proposed by the First People's Representative Conference of All Circles Negotiation Committee (list to be issued separately). The presidium elected Peng Zhen, Yu Xinqing, and Zhang Xiruo as the executive chairmen of the day's conference. Peng Zhen delivered the opening speech (full text to be issued separately). On behalf of the presidium, Peng Zhen expressed warm support for this conference in exercising the functions and powers of the People's Congress. His speech reflected the will and aspirations of the broad masses of the people, and the audience responded with continuous applause. In his opening speech, Peng Zhen announced the opening of the Second People's Representative Conference of All Circles in Beijing, which exercises the functions and powers of the People's Congress. He explained that this conference is the highest organ of power in Beijing, which will determine the city's governing policies, listen to and review the municipal government's work report, and elect the mayor, deputy mayors, and members of the municipal government to form the Beijing Municipal People's Government. At the same time, the negotiation committee of the Second People's Representative Conference of All Circles will be elected. He said: If everyone agrees, the negotiation committee will carry out the following tasks: ensure the implementation of the resolutions of the People's Representative Conference of All Circles, negotiate and put forward suggestions to the municipal government, assist the municipal government in mobilizing the people to support the front, suppress counter-revolutionaries, and participate in construction work, be responsible for preparing for the next People's Representative Conference of All Circles, and be responsible for the work of the democratic united front in this city. He pointed out: Although this conference is not a Beijing People's Congress formed by universal suffrage in terms of organization, it has broad, sufficient, and complete representation, and it can fully represent the will of the people from all walks of life in Beijing; it should and can represent the people from all walks of life in Beijing in exercising the functions and powers of the People's Congress. Chairman Mao instructed us three months ago, and now we have implemented Chairman Mao's instructions and realized Chairman Mao's expectations. He emphasized: From now on, the people of Beijing will directly manage their own regime. This is the result of the long-term anti-imperialist, anti-feudal, and anti-bureaucratic capitalist struggle of the people and the People's Liberation Army, the victory of people's democracy, and the victory of the great unity of the people from all walks of life. Then, he explained the central task for the future, calling on the people of all democratic classes in Beijing, all democratic parties, all people's organizations, and ethnic minorities to unite, overcome difficulties, respond to Chairman Mao's call, and strive to restore and develop Beijing's production and build the people's capital. After Peng Zhen finished his opening speech, the presidium announced the rules of procedure for this representative conference. After that, the "Organizational Regulations of the Second People's Representative Conference of All Circles in Beijing" (full text to be issued separately) proposed by the negotiation committee of the previous representative conference were discussed. During the discussion, each article was carefully discussed. All the representatives were satisfied with the organizational regulations. As a result of the discussion, the regulations were unanimously approved. Then, Mayor Nie Rongzhen, on behalf of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, reported on the implementation of the resolutions of the First People's Representative Conference of All Circles (up to the end of October) and the future work guidelines and plans (full text to be issued separately). In his report, Mayor Nie explained that the First People's Representative Conference of All Circles, in addition to adopting the military control commission and the municipal government's policy report and agreeing to continue the three important tasks mentioned in the report: (1) further consolidating the revolutionary order; (2) continuing to restore and develop production; (3) continuing to develop the people's cultural and educational undertakings, it also adopted 171 resolutions to be handled or referenced by the municipal government. By the end of October, in two and a half months, except for seven cases such as "establishing public bathhouses," which could not be implemented for the time being, the municipal government had considered the urgency and priority of the remaining 164 cases and implemented them separately. Some have been completed; some are still in progress; some have been drafted and are ready to be implemented. Mayor Nie reported in detail on the specific situation of the municipal government in implementing the resolutions of the First People's Representative Conference of All Circles, earnestly expressing the request to the entire representatives of this conference to review the work of the municipal government during this period. Regarding the future work guidelines, Mayor Nie said: The main ones are still the three important guidelines proposed by former Mayor Ye Jianying in the report of the First People's Representative Conference of All Circles and summarized by Peng Zhen on behalf of the presidium, which were adopted by the conference. In addition, in view of the development of the national revolutionary situation and the importance of Beijing's position, the municipal government intends to propose a fourth guideline, namely the municipal construction guideline. Regarding the comprehensive and long-term construction plan, we are soliciting opinions from all parties according to the people's requirements and submitting them to the competent authorities for consultation with experts to engage in drafting. Mayor Nie said: We have submitted a request to the Central People's Government for approval to have this conference elect a new Beijing Municipal People's Government through elections. I believe that if our guidelines and plans are adopted by the conference, this new Beijing Municipal People's Government will implement them. Finally, Mayor Nie reviewed the reasons for the recent rise in prices in Beijing, expressing that the municipal government is making its best efforts to carry out various measures to stabilize prices and ensure the supply of grain and coal in the capital in order to protect the people's lives. Finally, the conference approved the list of members of the government work report review committee and the proposal review committee of this representative conference and adjourned at 5 p.m. The conference will continue to meet at 2 p.m. this afternoon (21st).
