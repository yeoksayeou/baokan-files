The Asian-Australasian Trade Union Conference held in Beijing, the capital of the Chinese people, is not only an unprecedented great unity of the working class of Asia and Australia, not only an important event in the regional activities of the World Federation of Trade Unions since its establishment in October 1945, but also a powerful demonstration by the peace and democracy forces of the working class and people of Asia and Australia against the imperialists.

More than twenty years ago, during the Great Revolution in China, an international trade union conference was also held in China, but the lineup of representatives from various countries attending that conference was not as complete as it is today. The World Federation of Trade Unions held a regional conference in Dhaka, Africa in 1947, but the nature and significance of that conference was not as important as the one held here. Progressive working classes in Asian and Australian countries, like progressive working classes in other parts of the world, have launched resolute demonstrations against reactionary forces, but past demonstrations were dispersed in form. The Asian-Australasian Trade Union Conference held in Beijing is a united, unified, and victorious grand gathering of the working class, unprecedented in the history of the Asian-Australian labor movement. The reason why it can be successfully held in Beijing, the capital of the Chinese people, is due to the unprecedented growth of the peace and democracy forces in the world, headed by the Soviet Union, the great victory of China's revolutionary cause under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and the correct leadership and unyielding struggle of the comrades of the Executive Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions.

As pointed out in the report of World Federation of Trade Unions General Secretary Saillant, this Asian-Australasian Trade Union Conference is not a recent initiative of the World Federation of Trade Unions. As early as four years ago, when the World Federation of Trade Unions was established in Paris, it was decided to convene an Asian Trade Union Conference. This resolution is now fully linked together with the Paris Conference's resolution on the issue of national self-determination and the Paris Conference's resolution on the liberation of the people in colonial and semi-colonial countries. It has aligned the steps of the Asian and Australian working class, united the strength of the Asian and Australian working class, and is advancing towards the goal of victory.

These resolutions of the World Federation of Trade Unions Paris Conference are fully in line with the spirit of the declaration of the World Trade Union Conference held in London in February 1945. The London Conference declaration pointed out: "The system of using colonies and semi-colonies as areas for economic exploitation should be abolished, and the development of democratic trade unions in these countries should be assisted."

This proposition of the World Federation of Trade Unions is obviously incompatible with the interests of imperialist countries. If there were no colonies and semi-colonies in the world, imperialist countries would lose the basis for their existence and development. Therefore, it is no wonder that imperialist countries initially used the like of Green, Chairman of the American Federation of Labor, to obstruct the establishment of the World Federation of Trade Unions by various means. After the World Federation of Trade Unions was finally established under the unanimous demand of progressive trade unions around the world, government representatives of imperialist countries again tried to prevent the World Federation of Trade Unions from obtaining its due status in the United Nations, and tried to prevent the proposals put forward by the World Federation of Trade Unions regarding the interests of the working class around the world from taking effect. However, these conspiracies and attempts by the imperialists ultimately failed completely.

Then the imperialists wanted to carry out sabotage activities within the World Federation of Trade Unions. From the end of 1947 to the beginning of 1949, there was a fierce struggle within the World Federation of Trade Unions. The likes of Deakin of the British Trades Union Congress, Carey of the American Congress of Industrial Organizations, and Kupers of the Dutch Trade Union Federation, used the pretext of demanding that the World Federation of Trade Unions implement the so-called Marshall Plan to obstruct the establishment of the various industrial departments of the World Federation of Trade Unions, obstruct the holding of the Second Congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions, obstruct the convening of the Asian Trade Union Conference, and even proposed to stop the activities of the World Federation of Trade Unions. However, these attempts to betray the interests of the working class ultimately failed completely.

After the labor traitors in countries such as Britain, the United States, and the Netherlands, who betrayed the interests of the working class, failed in their conspiracy to sabotage the World Federation of Trade Unions and withdrew from the World Federation of Trade Unions, the World Federation of Trade Unions not only did not stop its activities, but instead actively expanded its work. The industrial departments of the World Federation of Trade Unions were established one after another, the Second Congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions was held in Milan from June to July this year, and the Asian Trade Union Conference was expanded into the Asian-Australasian Trade Union Conference, which is now being successfully held in the capital of the Chinese people. This is a great victory for the working class of Asia and Australia, and it is also a great victory for the working class around the world.

At this Asian-Australasian Trade Union Conference, it has been decided to establish a World Federation of Trade Unions Asian-Australian Liaison Bureau. This agency will collect information on the situation in various Asian and Australian countries, strengthen the connection between the labor movements in various Asian and Australian countries and the World Federation of Trade Unions, and provide the working class in various Asian and Australian countries with various possible practical assistance.

The establishment of this liaison bureau not only marks the beginning of a new era for the Asian-Australian labor movement, but also will obviously have a constructive and positive impetus on the current entire world labor movement.

This Asian-Australasian Trade Union Conference shows the unprecedented growth of the strength of the Asian-Australian working class, further consolidates the unity and unification of the Asian-Australian labor movement, strengthens the struggle of the Asian-Australian working class against imperialist political oppression and economic exploitation, and strengthens the confidence of various colonial and semi-colonial countries in Asia and Australia in defeating imperialism and its running dogs. I finally celebrate the great and successful victory of the Asian-Australasian Trade Union Conference.

　　亚洲澳洲工会会议的伟大胜利
  　中华全国总工会副主席朱学范播讲
    亚洲澳洲工会会议在中国人民的首都北京召开，不仅是亚洲澳洲工人阶级空前未有的大团结，不仅是世界工联自一九四五年十月成立以来在区域活动方面一个重要的盛会，并且是亚洲澳洲工人阶级和人民的和平民主力量对于帝国主义者的一个强大的示威。
    在二十多年前的大革命时代，在中国也曾召开过一次国际性的工会会议，但出席那次会议的各国代表的阵容，并没有象今天这样整齐。世界工联于一九四七年曾在非洲达卡召开过一次区域性会议，但那次会议的性质和意义，也并没有象在这里所举行的重要。亚洲澳洲各国进步的工人阶级，如象世界上其他各地进步的工人阶级一样，曾向反动势力发动了坚决的示威斗争，但过去的示威斗争，在形式上是分散的，这次在北京召开的亚洲澳洲工会会议，是团结的、统一的、胜利的，在亚洲澳洲工人运动历史上空前的一次工人阶级大会师。而所以能够在中国人民的首都北京胜利地召开，是由于世界上以苏联为首的和平民主力量的空前壮大，是由于中国的革命事业，在中国共产党和毛主席英明的领导下，取得了伟大的胜利，是由于世界工联执行局各位同志正确的领导，坚持着不屈不挠的斗争的结果。
    诚如世界工联总书记赛扬同志的报告中所指出，这次亚洲澳洲工会会议，并不是世界工联最近才决定的一个创举。远在四年以前，当世界工联在巴黎成立的时候，就决定要召开一个亚洲工会会议。这个决议现在是和巴黎大会关于民族自决权利问题的决议以及巴黎大会关于殖民地和半殖民地的人民解放问题的决议，在这个会议里可以充分地联结在一起，整齐了亚洲澳洲工人阶级的步伐，团结了亚洲澳洲工人阶级自己的力量，向着胜利的目标前进。
    世界工联巴黎大会的这些决议，是和一九四五年二月在伦敦举行的世界工会会议的宣言的精神完全符合的。伦敦会议的宣言指出了：“应废除以殖民地半殖民地为经济剥削地区的制度，并应协助这些国家内民主工会的发展”。
    世界工联这种主张，显然是和帝国主义国家的利益丝毫不能相容的。如果世界上没有了殖民地和半殖民地，帝国主义国家也就要失去了它存在和发展的依据了。因此，也就无怪帝国主义国家一开始就利用美国劳工联合会主席葛林之流，以各种方法阻挠世界工联的建立。当世界工联在全世界进步工会一致要求之下终于成立以后，帝国主义国家的政府代表又在联合国内要想使世界工联不能得到应有的地位，要想使世界工联所提出有关全世界工人阶级利益的建议不能发生效力，然而帝国主义者的这些阴谋企图是终于全部失败了。
    于是帝国主义者又要在世界工联的内部来进行破坏活动了。从一九四七年底到一九四九年初，世界工联的内部一直就存在着激烈的斗争。英国总工会的狄根，美国产业总工会的加莱以及荷兰工会联合会的顾伯斯之流，以要求世界工联推行所谓马歇尔计划为借口，阻挠着世界工联各产业部的建立，阻挠着世界工联第二届大会的举行，阻挠着亚洲工会会议的召开，甚至提出要求停止世界工联的活动。然而这些出卖工人阶级利益的企图，终于全部失败了。
    在英、美、荷等国出卖工人阶级利益的工贼，破坏世界工联的阴谋失败而退出了世界工联以后，世界工联不但没有停止它的活动，反而更积极地展开了它的工作。世界工联的产业部一个接着一个成立起来了，世界工联第二届大会已在今年六月至七月在米兰举行了，亚洲工会会议更扩大为亚洲澳洲工会会议，现在正在中国人民的首都胜利地召开了。这是亚洲澳洲工人阶级的伟大胜利，这也是全世界工人阶级的伟大胜利。
    在这次亚洲澳洲工会会议中，已决定建立一个世界工联亚洲澳洲联络局，这个机构将搜集亚洲澳洲各国情况的资料，加强亚洲澳洲各国工运与世界工联的联系，并予亚洲澳洲各国工人阶级以各种可能的切实援助。
    这个联络局的设立，不仅表示亚洲澳洲工人运动的一个新时代的开始，并且对于当前整个世界工运来说，显然将发生一种建设性的积极推动作用。
    这次亚洲澳洲工会会议表示出亚洲澳洲工人阶级力量的空前壮大，更进一步地巩固了亚洲澳洲工人运动的团结与统一，更加强了亚洲澳洲工人阶级反对帝国主义的政治压迫和经济剥削的斗争，更坚定了亚洲澳洲各殖民地和半殖民地战胜帝国主义及其走狗的信心。我最后庆祝亚洲澳洲工会会议的伟大胜利成功。
