　　October—This is Humanity's Happiness, Freedom, and Peace
　　Cao Jinghua
　　I. Remembering the Past, Spring on Pipa Hill
　　The thunder and lightning of the October Revolution in Russia in 1917 tolled the death knell of imperialism, and at the same time awakened the exploited and oppressed working people all over the world. From then on, they slowly recognized the path they should take. Since then, the imperialists have been panicked, regarding this red October as worse than the plague, doing their best to sabotage, isolate, block, and extinguish it. They attempted to lock their people in airtight safes with a policy of obscurantism, to avoid being "reddened," so that they would never know there was a Red October, never know there was a Soviet Union. These vampires, their intentions are painstaking, and their stupidity is beyond reach! The Chinese Kuomintang reactionaries are no exception in this regard. The October Revolution anniversary also clearly reflects the two atmospheres of the two worlds.
　　For many years, we have spent or celebrated this great festival of the working people of the world in different regions with different moods.
　　During the years of studying in the Soviet Union, on this day, we celebrated this human festival with incomparable joy, together with the Soviet people. Living in a free world for a long time, one gradually does not feel what it is like to be unfree in another world. In the autumn of 1933, when I returned to Beiping, it was like falling into a tomb, with narrow skies and land, and nets everywhere. At that time, Beiping was under the jurisdiction of "Commander of the Third Gendarmerie Regiment," the special agent leader Jiang Xiaoxian. That was the era when Jiang Chao's rule over Beiping was the most stringent. Under the protection of my brother Fan Wenlan, I used a false name to slip into Pingda Women's College to teach. Once, a student talked about me in front of me, without knowing that I was me. Such educators were probably not a few at that time. It is more appropriate to say that this is not so much a "teacher" as a magician who escapes the clutches of special agents and covers the workplace in that severe era. On November 7th of that year, with a heavy heart, I stood on the podium, recalling the joyful celebration scenes in the free country in previous years, which made me feel even more suffocated in the classroom, suffocated and unable to breathe.
　　In this way, until 1938, when I was at the Northwest Associated University in Chenggu, I was dismissed by Chen Lifu's order for the crime of promoting Marxism-Leninism and leading the activities of the National Vanguard, in the small world ruled by the Kuomintang, I spent that annual October festival with such a heavy heart. Every time on this day, I always uttered such a sentence in my heart: Our October will always come!
　　In 1939, I arrived in "Fog Chongqing." Chongqing's "fog" is not only a local natural phenomenon, but also a symbolic coincidence of the political weather of the Kuomintang reactionary rule. Gray, gloomy, heavy pressure, suffocation. The tentacles of the Kuomintang's special agents stretched everywhere under this dense fog, exploring, pursuing, and hunting for their targets. Who that loves sunshine does not curse this gloomy thick fog? However, Fog Chongqing only has fog. This dense fog circle that obscures the sky and covers the sun not only covers Chongqing, but also the entire Kuomintang-controlled area at that time.
　　I lived in Baisha, 270 miles away from Chongqing. The fog there was not thin either. It is said that Chen Lifu's confidant Xie (director of the university preparatory class), showed his skills in the fog, causing 32 outstanding young people to "disappear on their own" at one time. At that time, I was an editor of the Life Bookstore, and even this constituted one of the conditions for him to hunt. Baisha, I like you, I am attached to you, but I curse the gray, gloomy, heavy pressure, suffocating fog. On this year's October festival, I received an invitation from Ambassador Pan Youxin and immediately took a boat to Chongqing to climb Pipa Hill—the location of the Soviet Embassy—to attend the celebration of the October Revolution.
　　This was the first time in seven years since I left the Soviet Union that I had participated in the October Festival. On that day, from the bookstore clerks (Life Bookstore, etc.), the employees of the newspaper (Xinhua Daily), to the cultural workers who were suffocated and pale all year round in the thick fog and could not even breathe, flocked to Pipa Hill with joy to congratulate. Since then, this day has naturally become a free gathering day for cultural people to absorb fresh air, and also the happiest day for people who cannot breathe under the Kuomintang's fog. People who climbed Pipa Hill smiled with joy in the bright sunshine. They were encouraged to work even harder to welcome our October. There was no spring in "Fog" Chongqing that year, spring was only on Pipa Hill.

　　II. The Great Wall Between China and the Soviet Union is Gone
　　In the era when the Kuomintang reactionaries held power, their prevention and elimination of the Soviet Union and general progressive ideas were meticulous. It tried hard to build an insurmountable Great Wall between the Chinese and Soviet people. However, the fascism's cruelty was one foot high, and the people's struggle for freedom was ten feet high. Progressive cultural and educational workers, in those severe years, directly and indirectly under the leadership of the proletarian party, in different occasions, used pens, mouths, and actions to undermine the reactionary regime. To the vast number of young people to carry out progressive cultural smuggling work. Friends who participated in the work of the Left League, the Education League, and the Social League around 1931 were good examples. Especially before and after the "December 9th" Movement, educational workers in Beiping, in contradictions and in the cracks, carried out the smuggling of advanced cultural ideas. The most prominent ones were Fan Wenlan, Wu Chengshi, Chen Boda, Qi Yanming, Zhang Zhixiang, Zhang Youyu, Huang Songling, Yang Xiulin... Smuggling progressive cultural ideas, especially Soviet literature, social sciences, etc., bit by bit, infiltrated the minds of young people, acting as sowers of socialist seeds. Yanming, Boda, Shuyu (i.e. Zhang Zhixiang), and Mr. Wu, our "Hadan Society" formed later, carried out more effective collective cultural smuggling activities for young students in an organized, planned, and step-by-step manner. If the "December 9th" Movement was a bright flower in the history of modern Chinese student movements, then its direct cultivators were the "underground workers" sent by the proletarian party at that time.
　　There is a saying in China: "Grinding an iron beam into an embroidery needle, success comes naturally with effort." Mr. Lu Xun's "tenacious struggle" is the best work demonstration. Digging at the foundation, one brick a day, one brick per person, can the Kuomintang's attempt to build the Great Wall between China and the Soviet Union be built? That is just a last-ditch effort.
　　I remember that during the War of Resistance Against Japan, again in Chongqing, probably on the October Festival (or Red Army Day), the Xinhua Daily held a signature campaign for the Soviet people. A thick signature book was placed on the table in front of the Xinhua Daily's entrance on Wuku Street, allowing passers-by to sign freely. Even such things were obstructed and sabotaged by special agents in a planned and organized manner. Unkempt special figures wearing crooked hats were scattered near the entrance of Xinhua. When a pedestrian walked up to sign, he glared at you fiercely, hinting that you should know your place. Sometimes, when a person was signing, he would walk up to you and bump into you intentionally. Sometimes, he would greet you from afar, stare at you, and follow you until you understood and passed by the signature book empty-handed. This was to use hooligans to build a Great Wall to separate the people of the two countries. Can this be separated? The hearts of friendship between the people of the two countries cannot be separated by any Great Wall.
　　Under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, the People's Liberation Army overthrew the Kuomintang's hooligan rule, and the Great Wall between China and the Soviet Union is gone. The love between the people of the two countries flows like a warm current. The visit of the Soviet cultural delegation this time, in the Democracy Square of Peking University, at the farmers' meeting in the western suburbs, in the visit to the farmers' homes in Bagou Village... Anyone who sees these scenes, who can say that any Great Wall can cut off the fiery exchange of love between the two great nations that bursts out from the depths of their nature?! Where does this love come from?
　　It was produced in October. October is of the world, and there is no such Great Wall in the world that can separate the working people from October. Because the working people all crave happiness, freedom, and peace.
　　If I were to compile a Russian-Chinese dictionary, when I compile the word October, I would definitely reverse the traditional explanation, capitalize the first letter O of this word that the working people of the world like the most, and annotate below it: This is the happiness, freedom, and peace of the working people all over the world.

　　十月—这就是人类的幸福，自由与和平
    曹靖华
  　一、忆当年，春在枇杷山
    一九一七年俄国十月革命的雷电，撞响了帝国主义的丧钟，同时也惊醒了全世界被剥削，被压迫的劳动人民。从那时起，他们就慢慢认清了自己应走的道路。这以来，帝国主义者都惊慌起来，把这红色的十月看作比鼠疫还厉害，拼全力去破坏，隔绝，封锁，扑灭。企图用愚民政策，把自己的人民锁到密闭的保险箱中，避免赤化，使他们永远不知道有红十月，不知道有苏联。这些吸血鬼，其用心至苦，而其蠢也不可及也！中国国民党反动派，在这一点上也并不例外。在十月革命纪念中，也显明的反映出两个世界的两种气氛来。
    多少年来，我们怀着不同的心情，在不同的地域，度过或庆祝过这全世界劳动人民的伟大节日的。
    在苏联学习的年代里，在这天，那是怀着无比的欢快，同苏联人民一起，尽情的庆祝这人类的佳节。久处在自由的天地里，渐渐感不到另一个世界里不自由的滋味是什么样子。一九三三年秋回到北平，就如同坠入到墓坑中，天窄地狭，遍地网罗。当时的北平是“宪兵三团团长”特务头子蒋孝先管辖的。那是蒋朝统治北平最严密的时代。我受范文澜兄的庇护，用一个假名字，滑进了平大女院教书去。有一次，一个学生曾当着我的面，谈到我，而不知道我就是我。这样的教育工作者，当时怕不在少数呢。这与其说是为人师的“师”，到不如说是在那严峻时代，逃避特务毒手，掩护工作岗位的魔术师来得较恰当些。那年十一月七日这一天，我怀着沉重的心情，站到讲台上，回想着往年今日在自由的国度里，那欢腾庆祝的情景，更使我感到教室内的窒息，窒息得透不过气来。
    这样，一直到一九三八年，我在城固西北联大，同沈志远兄顶着宣传马列主义及领导民先活动的罪名，被陈立夫明令解聘为止，在国民党统治的小天地里，都是怀着这样沉重的心情，度过那一年一度的十月节的。每到这一天，心里总发出这样的一句话：我们的十月总要来到的！
    一九三九年就到了“雾重庆”。重庆“雾”，那不仅是当地的自然现象，而且是国民党反动统治的政治天气的巧合的象征。灰暗，阴森，重压，窒息。国特的触角，就在这绵密的雾罩下，到处伸展，探索，追逐，猎取他所要的对象。那一个爱阳光的人不诅咒这阴霾的浓雾呢？然而雾重庆却只有雾。这蔽天遮日的绵密的雾圈，不仅是罩了重庆，而且罩了当时整个的国统区。
    我当时住在距重庆二百七十里的白沙。那儿的雾也并不稀薄。据说陈立夫的亲信谢某（大学先修班主任），在雾中曾大显身手，一次就使当地三十二个优秀青年“自行失了踪”。我当时做了生活书店的编审委员，就连这也构成了他要猎取的条件之一。白沙呵，我欢喜你，眷恋你，但我诅咒那灰暗，阴森，重压，窒息的雾。这年的十月节，我得到潘友新大使的邀请，立即赶船下重庆，登枇杷山——苏使馆所在地——去参加了十月革命的庆祝会。
    这是我离开苏联以后，七年来第一次参加十月节的。那天，从书店的店员（生活书店等），报馆的（新华日报）职工，一直到终年处在浓雾中，窒息得面无血色，连气都透不过来的文化工作者，都成群结队，欢天喜地的做了枇杷山的贺客。以后每逢这一天，就自然而然的成了文化人吸取新鲜空气的自由大聚会的日子，也是国民党的雾罩下呼吸不灵的人们的最幸福的日子。登在枇杷山上的人，在那光艳夺目的阳光下，都笑得满心开了花。都鼓舞着去为迎接我们的十月而倍加努力。当年的“雾”重庆没有春，春只在枇杷山上。
    二、中苏之间的万里长城没有了
    国民党反动派在掌握政权的时代，对于苏联以及一般进步思想的防范，消除，那是无微不至。他努力要在中苏人民之间筑起一道不可逾越的万里长城来。可是法西斯残暴统治的魔高一尺，人民争自由的道就高一丈。前进的文教工作者，在那严峻的年代里，直接间接的在无产阶级政党的领导下，在不同的场合里，用笔、用口、用行动对反动政权作挖墙根的工作。对广大青年作进步文化走私的工作。一九三一年前后，参加左联、教联、社联等工作的朋友，都是很好的例子。尤其是“一二·九”前后，北平的教育工作者，在矛盾中、在夹缝中，进行着前进文化思想的走私工作。最显著的如范文澜、吴承仕、陈伯达、齐燕铭、张致祥、张友渔、黄松龄、杨秀林……以走私的方式，把进步的文化思想，尤其是苏联的文学，社会科学等，一点一滴的渗透到青年脑子里，作社会主义种子的播种人。燕铭、伯达、舒予（即张致祥）、吴老先生，我们稍后结成的“盍旦社”，更是有组织、有计划、有步骤的，对青年同学作更有效的集体文化走私的活动。如果说“一二·九”是中国近代学运史上的一朵鲜艳的花，那它的直接栽培人就是无产阶级政党所派出的当时的“地下工作者”。
    中国有一句俗话：“铁梁磨绣针，工到自然成”，鲁迅先生的“韧性的战斗”，这都是最好的工作示范。挖墙根，一天一块砖，一人一块砖，国民党企图在中苏之间建筑的万里长城能建得起来吗？那不过是穷途末路的心劳而拙吧了。
    曾记得，在抗战中间，又是在重庆，大概是十月节（或者是红军节），新华日报举办了给苏联人民签名运动。把又厚又大的签名册，摆在武库街新华日报门口的桌子上，让来往行人自由签名。就这样的事都遭到特务分子的有计划，有组织的阻挠与破坏。歪戴帽子的不三不四的特殊人物，满布在新华门口附近。行人走到跟前要签名时，他就凶狠的瞪你一眼，暗示着叫你识相。有时候，人在签名时，他就走到你身边，故意撞你一下。有时老远就迎上去，瞪着你，跟着你，直到你领会了从签名簿跟前空空过去为止。这是要用流氓堆起一道长城，把两国人民隔开来。这能隔开吗？两国人民的友谊的心，什么长城也隔不开的。
    人民解放军在英明的毛主席的领导下，把国民党的流氓统治推倒了，中苏之间的长城没有了。两国人民的爱，好象热流似的交流了。这次苏联文化代表团之来，在北大的民主广场上，西郊的农民大会上，巴沟村的农家的访问里………看见这些场面的人，谁能说，什么长城能隔断这从至性中迸发出来的两大民族间的火一般的爱的交流呢！？这爱是那里来的呢？
    这是十月产生的。十月是世界的，人间没有这样的长城能把劳动人民同十月隔开来。因为劳动人民都渴求幸福，自由与和平。
    我如果要编俄华字典的话，编到十月这个字的时候，一定一反以往传统的解释，把全世界劳动人民所最喜欢的这个字的头一个字母Ｏ字要大写起来，下边注释道：这就是全世界劳动人民的幸福，自由与和平。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　十月革命三十二周年于北京。
