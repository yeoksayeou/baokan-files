　　　　　How to Breakthrough Technical Level?
    After three production emulation campaigns last year, the labor intensity of all factory workers has increased by 36%. Without breaking through the existing level of production technology, it is impossible to increase production significantly. The first technical difficulty encountered in the first half of the year was that the glass melting furnace was facing its annual dismantling and repair period in February. In addition, the refractory materials for repairing the kiln were far from complete. Once construction started, it would be difficult to resume glass production within three or four months. Therefore, how to extend the life of the large kiln became the decisive key to whether the production plan could be completed.
    The high heat of 1,500 degrees and the pressure of more than 2,000 tons, this force impacted and eroded outwards from the kiln every second. The kiln bricks in contact with the solution level had been eroded by 80%. The old technician of seventeen years also shook his head and said: "It is not difficult to extend it for ten or eight days, but any more is not a joke. The Japanese would have done it long ago if they could!" The secretary of the Party General Branch Committee said: "We must get rid of the old brains of the old society, and everyone must come up with ideas!" The Rationalization Proposal Committee, led by the Soviet chief engineer and the Chinese deputy director, mobilized all employees, especially experienced old technical workers, to concentrate on studying this urgent difficulty to overcome. If the workers lacked confidence, the leaders encouraged them; if the workers were not sure, the leaders supported them; if the workers came up with a little clue, the leaders gave them scientific analysis and inspiration. Finally, Liu Maoyou, the director of the melting department, came up with a method to lower the level of the molten glass, eliminating the burden on the weak part of the kiln bricks. The director of the plate making department solved a series of technical problems caused by the increase in the distance between the molten liquid level and the glass plate making machine. This broke the Japanese technical conventions that had been in place for 25 years since the factory was built, extending the life of the large kiln by seven and a half months, increasing the glass production time by one-half in the first half of the year alone. According to the main issues urgently needed to be solved in the current production process, concentrating the intelligence of all employees to jointly overcome the shortcomings in production organization and mechanical equipment is the great economic value of rationalization proposals. For example, simply by slightly modifying a simple plywood, each plate making machine can produce 25,000 square meters more glass per month. Also, simply by slightly changing the method of stirring the gas furnace fire, 30% of fuel coal can be saved every year. As a result of the complete implementation of the employees' twelve rationalization proposals, the technical obstacles to completing the annual task in half a year were cleared.
    Implementing a work responsibility system that combines labor and machinery is the best way to exert the potential productivity of machinery. For example, a plate making machine that manufactures glass raw sheets must draw out the condensed "head," that is, the glass plate, from the high-heat solution surface before it can use mechanical force to pull out a continuous stream of products upwards. If the glass "head" is interrupted once, it will take another seven hours to draw out a new "head," which not only reduces production but also wastes fuel and electricity while the machine is idling. Now that each process in the plate making department is supervised by a dedicated person, the continuous production rate of each plate making machine has increased to 188%. Even small things like the mutual handover of three work shifts, because they can automatically inquire about the subtle changes in the machinery in the past eight hours before taking over, make the work closely connected, adding fifty working hours to the plate making department in one day and night. The Soviet director often said: "Every production manager must constantly study all the details and 'small things' in labor organization: even if only one minute that could be used is let go, it will cause the factory's machinery to idle for 15,000 working days a year." The glass factory used this precise labor organization to exert the potential productivity of each plate making machine to more than 93%, exceeding last year's record by 30%.

　　　　The Material Basis for Encouraging Technical Advancement
    If rationalization proposals are one of the best ways to implement a system that combines labor and technology, then the seven-grade wage system is the material basis for maintaining lasting labor enthusiasm and encouraging technical advancement. The seven-grade wage system implemented in the Far East Electric Power Company's factories is a basic wage standard graded according to the technical level of workers (including apprentices). The first grade is 2,400 yuan, which is determined based on the living expenses of one person at the general social living standard at the beginning of liberation. Taking this as 100, the progressive numbers for other grades are 120, 145, 175, 215, 260, and the seventh grade is 320. Workers whose work environment is detrimental to health receive a health care wage that is 15% of their basic wage. Departments that implement piece-rate wages receive 10% of their basic wage. The progressive bonus system implemented by the glass factory last year and the piece-rate wage system gradually being promoted this year are based on this wage level with a very large difference. The progressive rate of the progressive bonus system is also calculated separately based on the contribution to production. For example, when the output exceeds the quota by 5%, the progressive bonus rate for workers directly involved in the product manufacturing process is 10%, and the bonus rate for workers playing an auxiliary role is 5%. When the excess production reaches more than 40%, it generally relies on technological improvement rather than labor intensity. Therefore, the progressive bonus rate for laborers can only be equal to the excess production rate (direct workers) or even less (auxiliary workers), while the bonuses for technical personnel who bear major technical responsibilities progress to 70%. However, when the excess production reaches more than 75%, the progressive bonus rates for direct workers and technical personnel simultaneously increase to 100%, and auxiliary workers also increase to 70%, because such a record can only appear when all employees have made great efforts.
    The more production develops, the more the correctness of the seven-grade wage system becomes apparent. In the past, factories that treated wages as relief funds had many wage grades with very small differences. A rough worker with a family of seven earned more than an engineer. Production requires rapid improvement of technology, but new workers said: "What's the point of learning that? Others have been working for decades and still earn about the same as me!" Technical personnel said: "Why bother with this? Find an easy job, and you won't starve your family." A year ago, this egalitarian wage system once caused workers to flow out of Sino-Soviet enterprises, but as production developed, a large number of technical personnel immediately flowed to Sino-Soviet enterprises again. In the first half of the year, the average wage income of each worker in the glass factory increased by 40%. The low-priced rations of grain and daily necessities also increased greatly. If calculated based on a family of two, each ordinary worker can receive rations that are more than 2,500 yuan less than the market price, ordinary technical workers receive more than 3,200 yuan, technical personnel receive more than 4,700 yuan, and management cadres like factory directors and managers receive more than 10,000 yuan. In addition, the price of goods has fallen by about 80% compared to the most difficult period, greatly increasing the purchasing power of wages. If the cost of welfare facilities is added, the actual income of employees is even greater. When a typhoon hit Dalian in August, many workers' homes were damaged, but the workers went to work as usual. Although the factory director forced them to go home to rescue their homes by car, the workers were unwilling to stop working. This is certainly the result of greatly increased political awareness, but it can also be seen that the progressive bonus system plays a huge role in promoting it.
    The merit campaign, which politically encourages technical advancement, also uses output as the sole criterion for evaluating merit. Walking into the factory gate, everyone can see the "Glory Board" that looks like a reflection wall. The "Glory Board" is divided into three columns: red, yellow, and white, each column hanging the nameplates of more than 1,000 employees in the factory. Red represents "progress," and those whose output exceeds 10% or more are on the red list; yellow represents "ordinary," that is, exceeding output by 1% to 10%; white means they have just completed or have not completed the task. It is adjusted once a week based on the production daily record. This "Glory Board" clearly distinguishes between good and bad and is a vivid form of political mobilization. Before May of last year, the conditions for the staff and workers' congress to elect heroes and models were as many as seven, including politics, style, attitude, and learning... Only two involved production, and these two did not even find a standard for output. As a result, a commendation and model selection meeting that lasted for two days and two nights still did not elect anyone. The emotions of the staff and workers also relaxed immediately after the movement ended. The Soviet factory director said: "Talking about political awareness away from production will not produce any results. Output is the concentrated expression of political awareness, labor attitude, and cultural technology. It is unimaginable that people who do not seek progress politically can do a good job in production." After the implementation of the Glory Board, the merit campaign changed from a short-term assault that rises and falls to a long-term competition that continues to rise. There is no need to spend time selecting models and evaluating merits. The production daily record is the most concrete and accurate proof of merit; there is also no need to hold a conference to introduce merits. Everyone can see every day how everyone is moving forward. From January to June of this year, the number of people on the red list has increased from 46% to 62% of all employees, the number of people on the yellow list has decreased from 43% to 32%, and the number of people on the white list has decreased from 11% to 4%. All the Communist Party members in the factory, except for one new worker Party member, have exceeded their production tasks. Heroic models such as Liu Maoyou, who have been playing a leading role for two years, are outstanding Party members who have been tempered in production. The workers said: "Our factory has three good things: the bonus is higher than the quota, and the life improvement is good; the output increase is glorious, and the merit is good; the factory is developed, and the country is good!" Because they created the great achievement of completing the annual task in half a year, the production cost also decreased by 34%, saving the state a total of 230,000 million yuan. By August, the factory's own "Hope Plan" was also fully realized.

  　　　　　如何突破技术水平？
    经过去年三次生产竞赛运动，全厂职工的劳动强度已经提高百分之三十六了。不突破现有的生产技术水平，已经不可能大量提高产量了，而上半年在技术上首先碰到的困难，便是玻璃溶化窑在二月间又面临一年一度的拆修期。加以修窑的耐火材料远未齐备，一旦动工，三四个月内势难恢复玻璃生产。因此如何延长大窑寿命，便成了生产计划能否完成的决定关键。
    一千五百度的高热，两千多吨的压力，这股力量每一秒钟都从窑内向外冲击侵蚀着，与溶液水平面接触的窑砖已被侵蚀掉百分之八十了。十七年的老技工也摇着头说：“延长十来八天不大难，再多可不是闹着玩的。能办到日本人早就办了。”党的总支委书记却说：“咱们要打掉旧社会的旧脑瓜，大家想办法！”苏联总工程师和中国副厂长领导下的合理化建议委员会，便把全体职工特别是经验丰富的老技术工人发动起来，集中钻研这个急待克服的困难。工人没信心，领导者就鼓励他；工人没把握，领导者就支持他；工人想出一点苗头，领导者便给以科学的分析和启发。终于熔化部长刘茂有想出了降低玻璃熔液水平面的办法，消除了窑砖薄弱部分的负担，并由制板部长解决了因熔液水平与玻璃制板机的距离增大而引起的一连串技术问题。这样就一举打破了建厂二十五年以来的日本技术陈规，把大窑寿命延长了七个半月，仅仅上半年的玻璃生产时间即增加了二分之一。根据当前生产过程中急待解决的主要课题，把全体职工的智力集中起来，共同克服生产组织和机械设备的缺欠，这就是合理化建议的巨大经济价值。比方仅只是把一个简单的夹板稍加改造，每台制板机每月就可以多出二万五千平方米玻璃。又如仅只是稍为改变了绞拌煤气炉火的办法，每年就可以节省燃煤百分之三十。由于职工们的十二项合理化建议完全实现的结果，半年完成全年任务的技术障碍便扫清了。
    实现劳力与机械结合的工作负责制，则是发挥机械潜在生产力的最好办法。比方制造玻璃原板的制板机，必须从高热的溶液面引出凝成的“头子”即玻璃板以后，才能借机械力量向上拔出源源不断的产品，玻璃“头子”中断一次，就得再花七个小时才能引出新的，“头子”，不但减少产量，而且使机器在空转中白白耗费燃料和电力。现在制板部各个过程都由专人看管以后，每台制板机的连续生产率便提高到百分之一八八。甚至象三个工作班互相交代这样的小事，由于接手前都能自动询问过去八小时中机械的细微变化，使得工作紧密衔接，一昼夜间便给制板部增加了五十个工作小时。苏联厂长常常说：“每个生产管理人员，必须经常研究劳动组织方面的一切细节和‘小事’：那怕只是放过可能利用的一分钟，一年间就会使全厂的机械空转掉一万五千个劳动日。”玻璃工厂就是以这种精密的劳动组织，把每台制板机的潜在生产力发挥到百分之九十三以上，超过去年的纪录百分之三十。
    　　　　鼓舞技术上进的物质基础
    如果说合理化建议是制度实现劳动力与技术结合的最好方法之一，那么七级工资制度便是保持持久的劳动热情和鼓舞技术上进的物质基础。远东电业公司各工厂所实行的七级工资，是按照工人（学徒在内）技术程度划分等级的本俸即起码的工资标准。第一级两千四百元，是根据解放初期一般社会生活水平的一个人生活费用所订定。以此为一○○计算，则其他各级的累进数为一二○，一四五，一七五，二一五，二六○，第七级则为三二○。工作环境有碍健康的工人，按本俸增加百分之十五的保健工资，实行计件工资的部门则按本俸增加百分之十。玻璃工厂去年实行的超额累进奖薪制和今年逐步推行的计件工资制，便是以这个差超很大的工资等级为基础的。超额累进奖薪制的累进率也是根据对生产的贡献分别计算的。如产量超过定额百分之五时，直接起作用于产品制造过程的工人的累奖率为百分之十，起辅助作用的工人得百分之五。超产量到达百分之四十以上时，一般地不是依靠劳动强度而是依靠技术改进，因此劳动工人的累奖率只能等于超产率（直接工人）或更少（辅助工人），担负着技术重大责任的技术人员奖薪则累进至百分之七十。可是超产量达百分之七十五以上时，直接工人与技术人员的累奖率便同时增至百分之百，辅助工人也增至百分之七十，因为只有全体职工都作了巨大的努力，这种纪录才可能出现。
    生产越发展，越能看出七级工资的正确性。过去把工资当成救济金的工厂，工资等级很多，差额很小。家有七口的粗杂工人比工程师挣的还要多。生产要求迅速提高技术，新工人却说：“学那干啥，别人干几十年还不是和我挣的差不多！”技术人员则说：“何苦操这份心？找个轻快的活，一样饿不了家口。”一年以前，这种平均主义的工资制曾经一度使得中苏企业的工人外流，可是生产一发展，大批技术人员马上又流向中苏企业了。玻璃工厂上半年每个工人的工资收入平均提高了百分之四十。粮食及日用品的低价配给量也大为增加。如以两口之家的工人计算，每个普遍工人可以领到的配给品比市价少二千五百多元，普遍技术工人为三千二百多元，技术人员为四千七百多元，象厂长、经理那样的管理干部则为一万多元。另外，物价比最困难的时期下降了百分之八十左右，使得工资的购买能力大大提高。如果再加上福利设施费用，职工的实际收入就更大了。八月间台风袭击大连时，好些工人住宅被刮坏了，工人们却照常上工。尽管厂长用汽车强迫载送他们回家抢救，工人们还是不愿停止工作。这固然是政治觉悟大大提高的结果，也可以看出超额累进奖薪制的巨大推动作用。
    从政治上鼓舞技术上进的立功运动，也是以产量作为评功的唯一标准的。走进工厂大门，每个人都可以看到象映壁一样的“光荣牌”。“光荣牌”分红、黄、白三栏，每栏分别挂着全厂一千多职工的名牌。红色代表“进步”，产量超过百分之十以上的都上红榜；黄色代表“平常”，即超过产量百分之一到十；白色则是刚刚完成或没有完成任务的。根据生产日录，每周调整一次。这种“光荣牌”好坏分明，是一种生动的政治鼓动形式。去年五月以前，职工会选举功臣模范的条件共有七条之多，又是政治，又是作风，又是态度，又是学习……只有两条涉及生产，而这两条连一个产量的标准也找不到。结果开了两天两夜的评功选模大会，还是没有选出谁来。运动刚结束职工的情绪也顿时松弛了。苏联厂长说：“离开生产去谈政治觉悟，是谈不出什么结果的。产量，这就是政治认识、劳动态度和文化技术的集中表现。不能想象在政治上不求进步的人反而会把生产做好。”光荣牌实行以后，立功运动便从一起一落的短促突击变成不断上升的长期竞赛，用不着花时间选模评功，生产日录便是功绩最具体最确实的考证；也用不着开大会介绍功绩，每个人每天都可以看到大家是怎样地向前进步。从今年一月到六月，上了红榜的已由全体职工百分之四十六增至六十二，黄榜上的人数则由百分之四十三降至三十二，名落白旁的则由百分之十一降至百分之四了。全厂的中共党员，除了一名新工人党员以外，全部超过生产任务。两年来一直起着带头作用的英雄模范如刘茂有等都是在生产中锻炼出来的优秀党员。工人们说：“我们工厂有三好：超额累奖生活改善好；产量提高光荣立功好；工厂发达国家好！”由于他们创造了半年完成全年任务的伟绩，生产成本也随着下降百分之三十四，给国家节省的经费共达二十三万万元之多。到了八月，工厂自己订定的“希望计划”也完全实现了。
