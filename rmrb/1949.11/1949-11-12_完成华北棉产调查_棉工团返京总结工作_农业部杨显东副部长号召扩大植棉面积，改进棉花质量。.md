    Completion of Cotton Production Survey in North China
    Cotton Work Team Returns to Beijing to Summarize Work
    Vice Minister of Agriculture Yang Xiandong Calls for Expanding Cotton Planting Area and Improving Cotton Quality.
    [This newspaper reported] The former North China Cotton Production Improvement Office's cotton work team, which went to various cotton-producing areas in North China in mid-September to conduct cotton production surveys, select cotton seeds, and select and separate good seeds for collection, has returned to Beijing in full force in recent days. The team held a summary meeting from the 7th to the 11th of this month. After five days of reporting and group discussions, it concluded successfully yesterday. At yesterday's closing meeting, Zhang Guangju, Director of the Cotton Production Improvement Office, delivered a summary report, and Yang Xiandong, Vice Minister of Agriculture of the Central People's Government, also attended and spoke. Director Zhang Guangju said: The cotton production work team has basically successfully completed the three major tasks of seed selection, selection and separation of good seeds for collection, and cotton production survey. The specific gains of this work are: 1. A mass seed selection movement has been widely launched. If this work is continued for the next two or three years, the currently mixed millions of acres of Sizi No. 4 cotton can be improved into high-quality cotton with a lint length of about one inch. 2. The selection and separate collection of good seeds and the organization of the masses to retain seeds have proven that the purity of cotton can be increased to more than 80%. However, attention should be paid to implementing technical work through the mass line in order to achieve good results. 3. This work proves that the original estimate that North China's cotton production this year is about 60% - a total of 300 million catties - is generally correct. 4. The Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company has made practical guarantees for the ratio of grain to cotton prices this year, and cotton farmers have responded well, which is very helpful for expanding cotton planting area next year. Regarding the prevention and control of diseases and insect pests and the improvement of cotton cultivation, Director Zhang pointed out: Attention should be paid to mobilizing the masses to adopt simple and economical prevention methods, and to absorb the many valuable cultivation experiences of the masses, summarize and improve them, and then promote them to the masses.
    Vice Minister Yang Xiandong said: Today, under the leadership of the people's political power, the aspirations of cotton workers for many years can be realized. In the future, our work must be responsible to the entire Chinese people and serve them well. Although this work is very arduous, it will definitely be successfully completed under the wise leadership of the People's Government and with the support of the broad masses. China's cotton production has been declining since 1937, mainly due to the cotton control of Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionary government, and the large-scale import of American cotton after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. Judging from the current situation, the country needs 18 million dan of raw cotton every year, and maintaining the operation of 5 million spindles nationwide requires 12 million dan. Therefore, it is necessary to expand the cotton planting area and improve the quality of cotton in the future. If we can do a good job in improving varieties, increasing fertilizers, preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests, building water conservancy projects, and improving cultivation techniques, the existing cotton field area can be increased by at least 50%.

    完成华北棉产调查
    棉工团返京总结工作
    农业部杨显东副部长号召扩大植棉面积，改进棉花质量。
    【本报讯】于九月中旬分赴华北各产棉区从事棉产调查、棉花选种及选良分收工作的原华北棉产改进处棉业工作团，已于日前全部返京。该团于本月七日至十一日召开总结会议。五日来经过汇报及小组讨论，已于昨日圆满闭幕。在昨（十一）日的闭幕会上，棉产改进处张广居处长作总结报告，中央人民政府农业部杨显东副部长亦亲临讲话。张广居处长说：棉产工作团基本上已胜利完成了选种、选良分收及棉产调查三大任务。这次的具体收获是：一、广泛发动了群众性的选种运动，若今后二、三年内将这一工作坚持下去，可使现已混杂的数百万亩斯字四号棉，提高为一寸绒长左右的良棉。二、选良分收和组织群众自留种，经验证明可以将棉花提高到百分之八十以上的纯度，但应注意使技术工作贯彻群众路线，才能收到良好效果。三、此次工作证明，原估计华北今年棉产约六成左右——共三亿斤是大体正确的。四、花纱布公司今年对粮、棉比价问题作到了切实保证，棉农反映良好，对于明年扩大植棉面积甚有帮助。对于防除病虫害和改进棉花的栽培等问题，张处长指出：应注意发动群众采用简单而又经济的防除方法，并吸收群众中许多宝贵的栽培经验，加以总结提高，再推广到群众中去。
    杨显东副部长说：今天在人民政权的领导下，棉业工作者多年来的抱负可以实现了，今后我们的工作要向全中国人民负责，好好地为他们服务。这一工作虽然十分艰巨，但在人民政府的贤明领导下，再加上广大群众的支持，是一定能够胜利完成的。中国的棉花自一九三七年来，一直是减产的，这主要是日本帝国主义者和国民党反动政府对于棉花统制和抗战胜利后美棉大量输入的结果。就今日情况论，每年全国需要原棉一千八百万担，维持全国五百万纱锭开工，就需要一千二百万担。因此今后必需扩大植棉面积，并改进棉花质量。如能作好改良品种，增加肥料，防除病虫害，兴修水利，改进栽培技术，则现有棉田面积至少可以增产百分之五十。
