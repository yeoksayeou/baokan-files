　　　　(I) Telegram of Respect to Chairman Mao

Chairman Mao:

In order to cooperate with the current political situation and shoulder the tasks entrusted to us by history, under the general goal of unity and progress, our party convened a Representatives' Meeting of the Democratic Faction of our party in the people's capital on the 12th of this month. The representatives attending included members of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang (民革), the Association for Promoting Democracy of the Kuomintang (民联), the Kuomintang Promoting Democracy Association (民促), and democratic elements of our party outside these three units. The meeting lasted for five days, elected a new Central Committee and a Party Unity Committee, and declared a victorious conclusion. From today onwards, the democratic factions of our party have established a national unified organization. This is something worth reporting to you.

Since the death of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, our party has been usurped by the traitor Chiang Kai-shek, who acted perversely, harmed the country and the people, and the life of our party was hanging by a thread. Although many loyal comrades rose up to overthrow Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary rule and tried to restore Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary spirit and traditions, our strength was very limited, and what we did was far from enough. Fortunately, there was a strong and powerful friendly party under your leadership - the Chinese Communist Party and the great People's Liberation Army and a strong people's democratic united front, which enabled us to overthrow the reactionary rule and achieve a decisive victory in the revolution. We - the democratic faction of the Kuomintang - also have the opportunity to serve the people in the new China of New Democracy, for which we should express our heartfelt gratitude to you.

In the future, we will follow your banner, cooperate sincerely with all friendly parties, and strive to eliminate all reactionary remnants, implement the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and build an independent, democratic, peaceful, unified, and prosperous People's Republic!

　　　　(II) Telegram of Respect to the People's Liberation Army

Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and all commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army:

We - the democratic faction of the Kuomintang - are holding a representatives' meeting in the people's capital, and first of all, we would like to express our highest respect to you. It is because of your correct leadership and heroic fighting that we have been able to win the great victory of the Chinese People's Revolutionary War, overthrow the reactionary government of Chiang Kai-shek, which represents feudal comprador and fascism, so that the Chinese nation can be independent and the Chinese people can be liberated. Moreover, it is because of you that we can more effectively safeguard world peace. Your great achievements will be gloriously and forever written in the history of the Chinese nation, and your hard work will be enthusiastically and forever revered by all the Chinese people!

We want to call on the comrades of our party to unanimously support you and assist you in striving to eliminate all reactionary remnants and realize the liberation of all of China as soon as possible!

　　中国国民党民主派代表会议电毛主席及人民解放军致敬
    【新华社北京二十日电】中国国民党民主派代表会议通过向毛主席及人民解放军致敬电，电文如下：
    　　　　（一）向毛主席致敬电毛主席：
    本党为着配合当前的政治形势，担负历史所赋予我们的任务，在团结进步的总目标之下，本月十二日在人民的首都召开本党民主派代表会议。出席代表包括民革、民联、民促及三单位以外的本党民主分子，会议经过五天，选举了新的中央委员会和全党团结委员会，宣告胜利的闭幕。从今天起，本党的民主派已经建立了全国性的统一机构了，这是值得向您告慰的一件事。
    本党自从中山先生逝世后，便为叛徒蒋介石所篡窃，倒行逆施，殃民祸国，本党的生命不绝如缕，中间虽然有了不少忠贞的同志起来要把蒋介石反动统治推翻，图谋恢复中山先生革命的精神和传统，但是我们的力量很有限，我们所做的很不够，幸赖有了在您领导之下的一个强有力的友党——中国共产党和伟大的人民解放军以及坚强的人民民主统一战线，才能把反动统治推翻，革命才能获致决定性的胜利；我们——国民党民主派也就得到在新民主主义的新中国为人民服务的机会，这就应该向您表示衷心的感谢。
    今后，我们一走在您的旗帜之下，与各友党精诚合作，为肃清一切反动残余，实现人民政协共同纲领，建设独立、民主、和平、统一和富强的人民共和国而奋斗到底！
  　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　中国国民党民主派代表会议
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　一九四九年十一月十六日
    　　　　（二）向人民解放军致敬电毛主席、朱总司令暨人民解放军全体指战员：
    我们——国民党民主派在人民首都举行代表会议，首先要向你们表示崇高的敬意。因为依靠了你们正确的领导和英勇的战斗，才能赢得中国人民革命战争的伟大胜利，把代表封建的买办的法西斯的蒋介石反动政府打倒，中华民族才能独立，中国人民才能翻身；并且，依靠了你们，才能更有力地保障世界的和平。你们的丰功伟绩，永远地光荣地写在中华民族的历史上面，你们的艰辛劳苦，永远地热烈地为全中国人民所崇敬！
    我们要号召本党的同志一致的拥护你们，协助你们，为肃清一切反动残余，早日实现解放全中国而奋斗！
