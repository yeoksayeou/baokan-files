　　Beijing Public Factories
  　Implement Streamlining and Thrift
  　Lower Costs and Improve Quality
    [Beijing News] The thirteen public factories under the Beijing Municipal People's Government Industrial Bureau have implemented the resolutions of the Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference. In September and October, they have achieved initial results in streamlining, thrift, improving quality, and reducing costs. Among them, the Yanqing Paper Mill, the Tram Company, the Qinghe Woolen Mill, and the Water Company have performed relatively well. The Yanqing Paper Mill's material selection department streamlined all ten temporary workers in September. The September competition plan was for each person to select 225 jin of material per day, but in reality, each person selected an average of 295 jin per day, and in October, it increased to 336 jin. In terms of electricity saving, the factory improved the efficiency of the paper shredder in early October and stopped operating two rollers, saving about 4,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity per month. Significant achievements have also been made in improving quality. For example, the cost of each ream of white glazed paper in September was 828 yuan lower than in August. The percentage of substandard finished products has decreased from 21.2% of the total to 8.9%, with some individual units reducing it to 5%. Due to good quality and low cost, the factory's sales have also greatly increased. When the tram company's power plant replaced boiler tubes, the original plan was to use 400 workers, but only 93 workers were used to complete half of the work by the end of October. Since October, the company's repair shop has been doing external work, earning 1.8 million yuan in one month. The workers also repaired 698 damaged waste light bulbs in stock, saving 172,400 yuan compared to buying new ones. After the Water Company transferred 11 odd-job workers to participate in direct production and appropriately used machines in September, it saved 27,252 kilowatt-hours of electricity compared to August. The iron smelting workers increased the amount of iron smelted each time, saving 33,150 kilograms of coke in October. Since September, the Qinghe Woolen Mill has streamlined 23 people and invested them in sideline production. In the past, the factory's products had the problem of inconsistent colors, but since October, this shortcoming has been overcome by blending wool from various places in large quantities and manufacturing it in grades and batches. The new kiln factory saved a total of 15,513 jin of corn in soil extraction fees in September and October. At the same time, since the establishment of an inspection system in September, the percentage of substandard blanks has been reduced from 30% to 10%. In September, the material cost and furnace tending cost of the new glass factory were reduced by half compared to August. The new iron factory and others have also made considerable gains in production and conservation. But overall, the achievements of the factories in September and October were a step forward compared to the past, but they have not done enough in terms of democratic management, and the work system and specification standards are not perfect enough. The cooperation between the Party, government, and labor union in individual units is not close enough. These shortcomings urgently need to be overcome.

　　京市各公营工厂
  　贯彻精简节约
  　成本降低质量提高
    【北京讯】北京市人民政府工业局所属的十三个公营工厂，执行了京市各界代表会议的决议，九、十两月在精简节约、提高质量、减低成本方面已获初步成绩。其中尤以燕京造纸厂，电车公司，清河制呢厂，自来水公司等单位较好。燕京造纸厂选料部九月份精简了全部临时工十个，九月份竞赛计划是每人每日选料二百二十五斤，而实际上平均每人每日选了二百九十五斤，至十月份又增到三百三十六斤。在节电方面，该厂十月初提高碎纸机效率，停开两个碾子，每月可省电四千度左右。在提高质量方面，亦获显著成绩，如九月份白片艳纸每令的成本比八月份减低了八百廿八元。不合格的成品已由占全部百分之廿一点二减低到百分之八点九，其中还有个别的单位减到百分之五。由于质量好、成本低，该厂在销路方面也大大的打开了。电车公司发电厂换锅炉管子，原计划用四百个工，十月底完成了一半只用了九十三个工。该公司修造厂自十月份起做外活，一个月收入了一百八十万元，工人们并粘好了六百九十八个库存的掉口废灯泡，比买新的省了十七万二千四百元。自来水公司九月经过调拨勤杂人员十一人参加直接生产和适当调用机器，九月份比八月份节电二万七千二百五十二度。熔铁工人加多每次的熔铁量，十月份节省了焦炭三万三千一百五十公斤。清河制呢厂自九月份起，精简了二十三人投入副业生产。在过去，该厂产品有颜色不一致的毛病，但自十月份起将各地来的羊毛大调和，分级分批制造后，这一缺点已经克服。新建窖厂采土费九、十两个月共节省了玉米一万五千五百一十三斤，同时，自九月份建立检查制度后，不合格的坯子已由百分之三十减到百分之十。新建玻璃厂九月份产品成本的配料费和看炉费，比八月份减少了一半。新建铁工厂等在生产、节约方面也有相当收获。但总起来说，各厂九、十两月份的成绩比过去进了一步，可是在民主管理方面做得还不够，工作制度和规格标准也不太完善，个别单位党、政、工的合作还不密切，这些缺点都是急待克服的。
