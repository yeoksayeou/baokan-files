The entire body of officers and soldiers of the Hebei Military Region are enthusiastically responding to the movement to practice economy and provide disaster relief. The entire army began implementing the call to save one liang of rice per person per day for large kitchens and two liang of rice for small and medium kitchens starting from August 20th. After democratic discussion, the Dingxian Sub-district and Cangxian Sub-district even donated 80% or 30% of their previously saved food rations. The Political Department of the Provincial Military Region donated 500 jin of millet in September. In addition, in order to solve the problem of wheat seed shortages for the masses, the entire army has begun reducing its consumption of fine grains by half since September 15th and has launched a personal donation campaign of money and goods on a voluntary basis. Many comrades in the army have donated their long-term savings of cash, clothing, shoes, socks, towels, and other items. According to statistics from August 20th to the end of September (40 days) alone, a total of 7,080,686 yuan in cash, 94,492 jin of millet, 2,957 jin of wheat, 5,149 jin of horse feed, and a large amount of clothing, firewood, horse grass, and daily necessities were saved. Many soldiers and cadres have demonstrated the spirit of sharing weal and woe with the people. In addition, some organs and troops helped the masses with harvesting to solve their difficulties, gathered wild vegetables to help the masses survive the famine, and cut grass to solve their own bedding problems. According to incomplete figures from several units, including the directly subordinate Regiment 1 of the Military Region and the Shijiazhuang, Hengshui, Cangxian, Xingtai, and Handan sub-districts, they helped farmers harvest 8,047 mu of crops, bundled sorghum stalks and threshed 3,300 mu, plowed and harrowed 998 mu, planted 161 mu of wheat, and watered and hoeed 240 mu of gardens. Secondly, the Cangxian, Hengshui, and Xingtai sub-districts launched a campaign to gather wild vegetables for disaster relief. According to September statistics, the Cangxian sub-district gathered 43,585 jin. All organs and troops stationed in disaster areas organized manpower to help the masses with locust control, flood prevention, insect trapping, and other disaster relief work.

Currently, all organs and troops have made plans to save public expenditures, strengthen the management of food, raise pigs, grind flour, and grow vegetables themselves, and further promote the movement to practice economy and provide disaster relief.
