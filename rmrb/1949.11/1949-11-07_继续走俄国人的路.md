Continue on the Path of the Russians
	Qian Junrui

Today, the working people of the world and all who love democracy and peace are joyously celebrating the thirty-second anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution. This is certainly not without reason. The world's people have gradually come to recognize and believe in Stalin's words through their own experiences. Stalin said: "The October Revolution not only shook imperialism, it also established a powerful and open foundation for the world revolutionary movement, namely, the first proletarian dictatorship, a foundation that the world revolutionary movement had never had before, and now it can rely on this foundation." He also said: "The most predictable thing is that the world revolution will develop through many new countries breaking away from the system of imperialist countries by revolutionary means, while the proletariat of the imperialist countries will assist the proletariat of these new countries." He further said, "The more thoroughly socialism is consolidated in the first victorious country, the more rapidly this country becomes the foundation for further expanding the world revolution, the main weapon for further destroying imperialism, then the process of development of the world revolution, the process of many countries breaking away from imperialism, will certainly become more rapid and more thorough."

History has almost translated Stalin's words into living facts, word for word. For thirty-two years, hasn't the Soviet Union, the "old liberator" of all mankind, truly been a backing for the people of the world to stand up? Hasn't it truly become the main weapon for destroying imperialism? (Look, the anti-fascist war, with the Soviet Union as the main force, knocked down three imperialist countries and wounded two imperialist countries in one go!). At the same time, hasn't the development and consolidation of socialist construction in the Soviet Union promoted the process of many new countries breaking away from the imperialist system faster and more thoroughly? After the Second World War, didn't countries such as Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Albania, and North Korea in Asia, break away from the imperialist system and move towards democracy and socialism with the direct help of the Soviet Union?

Our China, inspired by the October Revolution, took the path of the Russians and, after a long struggle, became the first large country in the East to break away from imperialism. There is no doubt that this is a world-shaking great victory. The people of the world applaud this victory, while the imperialists and their running dogs are panicked, sighing and groaning. This is indeed a matter of pride for the Chinese people and the people of the world. However, if the October Revolution had not brought us Marxism-Leninism, if the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Communist International had not helped us establish the Chinese Communist Party, if the Soviet Union, created by the October Revolution, had not consistently provided sympathy and support to the Chinese people for thirty-two years, then could we have such a great victory today? Could we have such a great People's Republic of China standing so firmly in the world, cheered by the people of all countries? That would be absolutely impossible. This is the foundation for the Chinese people's love and deep gratitude towards the Soviet state, the Soviet people, and the great Lenin and Stalin. The friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people is a great friendship of struggle. For thirty-two years, it has been the big brother, and I have been the little brother, and we have fought hand in hand, shoulder to shoulder, for the happiness of the people of both countries and the people of the world. Now, the big brother has brought the little brother to the fore, and the "old liberator" has brought out a big "new liberator" in the East, and everyone is so happy that they can't close their mouths. Our "new liberator" will become stronger day by day with the help of the "old liberator." Our direction is to follow the example of the old liberator, that is, to continue on the path of the Russians. We must never take any other path. Because the experience of China and the experience of foreign countries tell us that, apart from the path of the Russians, that is, the path of Marxism-Leninism, all other paths, for the people, are called "this road is impassable" or "a dead end." Therefore, we must earnestly learn from the Soviet big brother, and we must earnestly consolidate the fraternal friendship with the Soviet Union. Learning from the Soviet Union and consolidating Sino-Soviet friendship is a fundamental guarantee for the construction of the new China.

The glory of October will forever illuminate us and the people of the world. The new era of the demise of capitalism opened up by the October Revolution has become even more mature. The clamoring and frantic struggles of the imperialists and their running dogs will never save them from the fate that the October Revolution has long arranged for them.

### 继续走俄国人的路

　　继续走俄国人的路
    钱俊瑞
    今天全世界的劳动人民和一切爱好民主和平的人都在欢天喜地庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命三十二周年。这当然不是没有根据的。全世界的老百姓已经凭着他们的亲身体验逐渐地认识和相信了斯大林的话。斯大林说：“十月革命不仅动摇了帝国主义，它同时还为世界革命运动建立了强大的公开的基础，即第一个无产阶级专政，这个基础是世界革命运动从来没有过的，而现在它却能把这个基础作为靠山了。”他又说：“最可预期的，是世界革命将会经由许多新国家用革命手段脱离帝国主义国家的体系，而同时各帝国主义国家的无产阶级却援助这些新国家的无产阶级的道路发展。”又说，“第一个获得胜利的国家内的社会主义愈加彻底巩固，这个国家愈加迅速地变成为更加扩展世界革命的基础，变成为更加摧毁帝国主义的主要武器，那么世界革命的发展过程，许多国家脱离帝国主义的过程，也一定愈加迅速和愈加彻底”。
    历史几乎把斯大林的话一个字一个字地翻译成了活的事实。三十二年来，苏联这个全人类的“老解放”不是确确实实作了全世界人民翻身的靠山么？不是确确实实成为摧毁帝国主义的主要武器么？（你看，上次以苏联为主力的反法西斯战争就一家伙打倒了三个帝国主义国家，打伤了两个帝国主义国家！）。同时，苏联的社会主义建设的发展和巩固，不是促使许多新国家脱离帝国主义体系的过程越来越快，越来越彻底么？在第二次大战之后，不是一下子就有波兰、捷克、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、匈牙利、阿尔巴尼亚和亚洲的北朝鲜等国，在苏联的直接帮助下，脱离了帝国主义的体系，走向民主与社会主义么？
    我们中国，就是接受了十月革命的启示，走了俄国人的路，经过长期的奋斗，在东方第一个脱离帝国主义的大国家。毫无疑问，这是一个翻天覆地的大胜利。对于这个胜利，全世界人民都拍手叫好，全世界的帝国主义者及其走狗都惊惶失措，唉声叹气。这的确是我们中国人和全世界人民值得骄傲的事情。但是，如果没有十月革命给我们送来了马克斯列宁主义，如果没有苏联共产党和共产国际帮助我们建立起中国共产党，如果没有十月革命所创造的苏联三十二年来对我们中国人民一贯地实行同情支援，那么，今天我们能不能有这样伟大的胜利局面呢？我们能不能有这样伟大的中华人民共和国如此坚挺地屹立于世界，为各国人民所欢呼呢？那是万万不可能的。中国人民对于苏维埃国家，对于苏联人民，对于伟大的列宁和斯大林之所以如此热爱和深深感激，其基础就在此。中苏两国人民的友谊是伟大的战斗之谊。三十二年来，它是老大哥，我是小兄弟，我们手牵手，肩并肩地，为着两国人民和全世界人民的幸福而不停地战斗。到如今，老大哥把小兄弟带出了头，“老解放”在东方带出了一个大大的“新解放”，大家欢喜得合不上口。我们“新解放”得到“老解放”的帮助就会一天天巩固。我们的方向是向老解放看齐，就是说，还是继续走俄国人的路。我们决不能走别的路。因为中国的经验和外国的经验都告诉我们，除了俄国人的路，即马克斯列宁主义的路以外，别的一切道路，对于人民来讲，都叫做“此路不通”，或“死路一条”。因此，我们要认真地向苏联老大哥学习，要认真地与苏联巩固兄弟手足之谊。学习苏联，和巩固中苏友谊，是新中国建设成本的一个基本保证。
    十月的光辉将永远照耀着我们和全世界人民。十月革命所开辟的资本主义灭亡的新纪元已经更加成熟了。帝国主义者及其走狗的叫嚣和疯狂挣扎，决然挽救不了十月革命所替它们早已安排好了的命运。
