Strengthen Mine Management Organizations, Resolutely Implement Democratic Management
  Strengthen Coal Mine Safety Equipment, and Implement Mass Security Work
    The meeting decided to pilot a model coal mine in the Datong coalfield, using machinery for everything from coal mining, transportation, and refining to loading trains. Other mines can send employees to visit and practice, in order to strive for a gradual and universal transition from manual to mechanized coal mining. In terms of production management, it was decided that mine management committees should first be established or improved, democratic management should be resolutely implemented, the idea of workers as masters should be established, and the active role of workers should be brought into play. At the same time, the economic accounting system should be implemented, and quota-based production management should be implemented. Strict budget systems must be implemented for labor, efficiency, material consumption, and expenditure. Products should be sold in a unified manner, basic materials should be supplied in a unified manner; regular mining should be implemented to achieve the standards of "good quality, high output, and low cost." In order to strengthen the connection between various levels, improve production efficiency, and strengthen labor discipline, the meeting specified in detail the reporting system at all levels, the work reward and punishment system, and the production report system. In the well, according to the specific situation of each pit, the number of workers in the pit was proposed, the team leader responsibility system and the single leadership system were implemented to improve production efficiency, and the tool contract system was implemented to save materials and exert the effectiveness of tools.
    The meeting especially raised the issue of coal mine safety equipment. At present, underground accidents in many mines continue to occur, and workers are suffering heavy casualties. Therefore, it was determined that cadres at all levels must first recognize the importance of safety ideologically, raise "safety first" to a principle, and mobilize all employees to carry out mass security work. It also stipulates that the mine manager must go down the well regularly for inspection, the engineers must work in the well, quickly repair and add various equipment, overcome water, fire, and wind accidents, and ensure the safety of roadways, workers, and machinery and equipment. Regarding the wage issue, the meeting, in accordance with the spirit of rewarding employees for improving their technical capabilities, uniformly stipulated the implementation of a piece-rate wage system and wage standards in 1950, and the wages of miners were generally increased compared to the past. At the same time, it was stipulated that the wages of the same type of employees working underground must be higher than those working above ground. The meeting unanimously resolved that attention must be paid to workers' welfare, improving employees' lives, organizing consumer cooperatives and recreational activities, and implementing labor insurance, so that workers can settle down to work in the mines. Strengthen employee education, establish an amateur learning system, improve workers' political and cultural level and class consciousness, and open specialized technical schools or short-term technical training classes to train technical cadres at all levels from among the workers in a planned manner. At the end of the conference, Chen Yu, Minister of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government, made a concluding report. He particularly pointed out that the main gain of this conference was that everyone exposed and overcame the conservative ideas in the past in guiding ideology, gradually agreed with the central leadership ideology, and clarified the importance of the mass line in coal production, and formulated next year's production plan and various systems. He also said: North China has the richest coal reserves, and they are all industrial coal. The development of China's industry mainly depends on the coal in North China, so our task is particularly important. He called on everyone to resolutely implement the spirit and resolutions of this conference and meet the new tasks of 1950.

　　健全矿山管理机构坚决贯彻民主管理
  　加强煤矿安全设备实行群众性保安工作
    会议决定于大同煤田试办一示范煤矿，从煤炭之采掘、搬运、精癣以至装火车，均用机械，其他各矿可派职工参观实习，以争取由手工方式逐步普遍转为机械化采煤。在生产管理方面，决定首先要建立或健全矿山管理委员会，坚决贯澈民主管理，树立职工主人翁思想，发挥职工积极作用。同时要贯彻经济核算制度，实行定额的生产管理，无论人工、效率、器材消耗、经费开支等，均须执行严格的预决算制度，产品实行统销，基本器材统筹供应；实行正规采掘，达到“质量好、产量多、成本低”的标准。为了密切各级联系，提高生产效率，加强劳动纪律，会议详细规定了各级请示报告制度，工作奖惩制度，生产表报制度。在井下根据各坑具体情况，提出坑下工人定员，实行小组负责制，单一领导制，提高生产效率，并实行工具包干制，以节约器材，发挥工具效能。
    会议特别提出了煤矿的安全设备问题。现在许多矿坑的井下事故不断发生，工人伤亡很大，因此确定各级干部首先要从思想上认识安全的重要性，将“安全第一”提高到原则高度，发动全体员工，进行群众性的保安工作。并规定了矿长按时下井检查，工程师井下办公制度，迅速修复和增添各种设备，克服水火风事故，保障坑道、工人及机械设备的安全。关于工资问题，会议根据奖励职工提高技术能力的精神，统一规定了一九五○年实行计件工资制度和工资标准，矿工工资比过去一般的都提高了。同时规定同一类职工人员，在井下工作的工资必须高于井上工作者的原则。会议一致决议必须注意工人福利，改善职工生活，组织消费合作社及娱乐活动，实行劳动保险，使工人安于矿山工作。加强职工教育，建立业余学习制度，提高工人政治文化水平和阶级觉悟，开办专门技术学校，或短期技术训练班，有计划的从工人中培养各级技术干部。大会最后由中央人民政府燃料工业部陈郁部长作总结报告，他特别指出：这次会议的主要收获是大家暴露并克服了过去在指导思想上的保守观念，和中央领导思想逐渐一致，明确了煤业生产中群众路线的重要性，制订了明年生产计划，和各种制度。他又说：华北的煤蕴藏最富，而且又都是工业用煤，中国工业的发展，主要依靠华北的煤，因此我们的任务特别重大。他号召大家要坚决贯彻这次会议的精神和决议，迎接一九五○年的新任务。
