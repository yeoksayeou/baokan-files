Therefore, he asked everyone to express their opinions and raise questions on how to report on the policies, methods, and experiences of land reform. Subsequently, the attending reporters spoke and raised many questions. Finally, Chai Zemin provided a comprehensive explanation. He also suggested that future reports should focus on: exposing the crimes of landlords and local bullies, introducing the experiences of the land reform movement and the activities of farmers in land reform, as well as their emotions after land reform.
