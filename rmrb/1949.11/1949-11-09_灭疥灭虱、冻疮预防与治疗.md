After the Field Army Military Health Department issued a notice about eradicating scabies and lice last year, the Column Health Department did not treat it as a current central task. They simply forwarded the original text to the brigade and regimental health organizations. By the end of the year, on the 27th, they still had not created a treatment plan, let alone launched a mass movement. At this point, the Column Health Department realized that this work was a concrete task at hand and required the joint efforts of the military, political, supply, and health departments. On December 29th, the Column Health Department convened the medical section chiefs of each brigade and directly subordinate units (teams) to discuss how to proceed and complete the task.

　　Concerning Eradicating Scabies

    I. Mobilizing a Mass Movement and Setting Time Limits: The Column leaders also paid close attention to this issue and issued an order: "Currently, 2,000 people in the entire column have scabies, and two-thirds of the total number have lice. During this rest period, administrative leaders at all levels should assign dedicated personnel to work with health organizations to carry out this important task. Severe scabies cases should be concentrated at the brigade health unit, with the brigade health director assigning dedicated personnel to focus on intensive treatment. Regiments, battalions, and companies should organize teams at the company, platoon, and squad level, with the health captain taking full responsibility for treatment. The intensive period for eradicating scabies is from January 3rd to 15th of this winter, and for eradicating lice from the 3rd to the 10th. Each person is allowed two days of leave to complete this task. The specific implementation methods should be executed according to the discussions at the Column Health Medical Section Chief's meeting."

    II. After receiving the order from the Column leaders, each brigade, regiment, and battalion held meetings. In some brigades, the chief of staff or deputy brigade commander, regimental chief of staff or deputy regimental commander, battalion, deputy battalion commander, or political instructor, and company level directly took charge. Some company level cadres personally went to boil water and supervise. Although military drills continued during these two weeks, everyone was mobilized. For example, the health captain of the 17th Regiment of the 6th Brigade only provided treatment, while other tasks were done by the regiment, battalion, and company leaders themselves. The health captain of the 7th Regiment of the 9th Brigade suggested that the entire regiment take a bath to cooperate with the scabies eradication efforts. The regimental leaders personally took action, not only issuing orders but also personally going to the companies to supervise. As a result, everyone except for those who were out on duty took a bath.

    The director of the 4th Brigade Recuperation Center personally took charge of washing, tweezing off scabs, fumigating, and applying medicine to the dozens of severe scabies cases collected by the 4th Brigade.

    III. The chiefs' meeting decided on the scabies treatment organization: severe cases (pustular scabies) were concentrated at the brigade health unit, while mild cases were organized at the battalion or company level. The battalion doctor first registered and treated cases in the battalion. Treatment method: sulfur fumigation. Scabies patients were instructed to use wood ash (boiled) water, soap, or calcium polysulfide solution to tweeze off each scab (using skin tweezers), then rinse with 1% saline solution. They would then sit naked on a small stool, completely surrounded from the head down by two cotton quilts. 8 grams of sulfur granules were placed in a container (or even a brick or tile) and lit, then placed under the patient's stool. After ten minutes, the sulfur would burn out. The patient would then remain still for another ten to fifteen minutes, then wrap themselves in the quilts and rest on a heated kang for one to two hours before putting on disinfected clothing. This was repeated every other day, up to a maximum of five times. No matter how severe the scabies, it would be cured.

    Fumigation and application were performed simultaneously for even faster results. That is, after fumigation and resting for one to two hours, or after the second wash, 10% sulfur ointment was applied. Three fumigations and three applications would result in a full recovery.

    Important Considerations:

    (1) It is best to have a piece of oil paper or oilcloth the size of a palm, and then wrap the scrotum and genitals with two or three layers of cloth and oil paper to prevent edema due to skin irritation.

    (2) The amount of sulfur should not be excessive. Pay special attention to the burning flame to avoid burning the skin.

    (3) Use a damp towel as a mask to prevent irritation and vomiting or difficulty breathing caused by sulfur dioxide.

    (4) Ensure a tight seal to prevent any sulfur fumes from escaping.

    (5) Ensure good ventilation in the room and maintain a suitable temperature to prevent catching a cold.

    IV. Other Treatments: Ointments such as 10% sulfur, or a combination of a small amount of mercury and sulfur, or Chinese medicine (arsenic) and sulfur were also used. In all cases, it is important to wash thoroughly and apply the medicine correctly.

　　Eradicating Lice

    I. After the order from the military leaders, everyone responded. However, there were some practical difficulties: ① It was cold, and there were not enough clothes to change into. ② People were afraid of steaming clothes because they might get wet or burned. ③ It was snowing, and there was no way to transport firewood back. ④ Taking apart and washing clothes was difficult because there was no thread for sewing, and the clothes wouldn't dry. These difficulties were overcome through repeated explanations by administrative leaders and health personnel, as well as by the health organizations taking the lead in taking action, which led to the completion of mass mobilization.

    II. Lice Eradication by Steaming: The structure of the steaming pit was modified many times; some twice, some three times, before it was successful. One pit was about two feet wide, six to seven feet long, and seven feet deep. The surrounding area was not bricked. The pot was small, and the gas was not strong enough. After steaming for more than four hours, burning more than 300 pounds of firewood, the lice were not killed, and the clothes were wet, causing many people to lose confidence. Later, the pit was renovated with bricked walls, about seven feet wide, long, and deep. The pit could hold at least two dan of water (60 jin per dan) with a pot (a large army pot is best). A row of five wooden sticks was placed on the pit wall at a height of about three and a half feet. Blankets and clothes were hung on the sticks. Clothes must also be hung well, and blankets must be folded into three folds and hung horizontally on the sticks like when tidying up bedding. Up to five layers can be added. The pit, seven feet wide and long, can hang 80 to 100 cotton blankets. Forty to sixty sets of cotton clothing can also be placed on the upper layer, and they must also be supported by sticks to prevent the gas from penetrating. Clothes must only be hung up after the water in the pot has boiled, otherwise, the clothes will get wet. The lid is a large door panel with a straw curtain under it to direct the steam onto the curtain to prevent the clothes from getting wet. The door panel must be airtight. When taking the clothes out, open the door panel and immediately take out the clothes and sun them for ten minutes until they are dry. Otherwise, the gas will cool down and turn into water, wetting the clothes. Be careful to build the chimney well and seal the pot's edges with mud to prevent the flames from being drawn into the pit and burning the clothes. One pit per battalion is enough. Steam blankets during the day and clothes at night. Using the above method, the first pot takes 150 jin of firewood for three hours, the second pot takes 80 jin of hard firewood for only two hours, and the third pot takes 60 jin of firewood for only one hour. The fourth pot has the same effect as the previous three hours. The big lice are dead, and they turn to powder when wiped.

    III. The 4th and 6th Brigades both adopted this method to eradicate lice. The medical assistant and two health workers of the 3rd Battalion of the 12th Regiment of the 4th Brigade dug for two days to prepare the pit and utensils. In two days, the three people steamed the clothes of all comrades in the battalion once, and the steaming was good. The 8th Regiment roasted the lice on the fire and froze them outside at night before sweeping them off with a broom, but the result was incomplete. The lice eggs were still on the clothes.

    IV. Although this eradication was not thorough, after visits by health personnel from the entire army and several modifications to the steaming pit, everyone had a considerable understanding of this issue. In the future, they will do a good job on this issue with dedication.

　　Causes, Prevention, and Treatment of Frostbite and Cracked Skin

    I. There was no good prevention work done around the New Year in the solar calendar, and no lessons on frostbite prevention were given. We were on the banks of the Yellow River, and each unit still did morning exercises and bayonet practice at 6:00 AM. Because the soldiers were of different ages and experience, the bayonet movements were not uniform, and each movement was repeated several times. Also, because it was snowing, the shoes could not stay dry during drills in the villages and in the field. Some units held meetings all day and watched operas outdoors at night. All of these factors resulted in a severe number of frostbite cases, reaching more than 800 in the 4th Brigade, both mild and severe.

    II. After the decision on prevention and treatment was issued, the units were notified on January 6th to change morning exercises from bayonet practice to running and grenade throwing, without emphasizing posture. Old clothes were used to make gloves, and everyone was mobilized to prevent frostbite. By January 15th, most of the cases had been cured.

    III. Summarizing Experiences and Lessons: ① We must be conscientious in our prevention work, and frostbite prevention education must be extensive and reach the masses. ② Early Prevention: In case of extremely cold weather, health organizations should advise leaders to stop or reduce bayonet practice and other activities that expose hands and feet. They should also prepare some medicine for frostbite early on to treat frostbite quickly when it occurs.

　　灭疥灭虱、冻疮预防与治疗
    去年接到野战军某军卫生部关于灭疥灭虱通知后，纵队卫生部没有当成目前中心任务，就此原文发到旅团各卫生机关，到年底二十七日还未作出治疗计划，根本谈不上群众性运动。此时纵队卫生部才发现这个工作是当前一个具体工作任务。非军、政、供、卫协同不可。十二月二十九日纵队卫生部即召开各旅医务科长直属所（队）研究其进行办法，如何完成任务。
　　关于灭疥
    一、发动群众性的运动及时间的规定：纵队首长也很注意这一问题，并下了命令：“现全纵生疥者达二千人，生虱者占全数三分之二，在此休整期内各行政首长抽专人协同卫生机关当作重要任务执行。重疥集中旅卫，由旅卫生部长指派专人负责突击。团、营、连组织连、排、班，由卫生队长负专责治疗。灭疥以今冬一月三号到十五号为突击期，灭虱以三号到十号。准许每人给假两天，分别完成。具体进行办法，按纵卫医务科长会议讨论的执行。”
    二、各旅、团、营接到纵队首长命令后，都召开了会议，有的旅：参谋长或副旅长、团参谋长或副团长、营、副营长或政教、连级直接负责、有的连级干部自己去烧水督促。在这半月中虽然进行了军事操课，但每个人都动员起来了，如六旅十七团卫生队长只是治疗，其他都是团、营、连首长亲自去做的。九旅七团卫生队长提议全团都要洗一个澡，来配合灭疥的进行。团首长就亲自动手，不但下命令，且亲自下连队督促，结果除个别外出人员外都洗了。
    四旅休养所长亲自负责把四旅集合的几十个重疥号给洗、镊掉疥痂及熏、擦。
    三、科长会议讨论，决定了治疥组织：重的（脓泡疥）集中旅卫，轻的以营或连组织。营由营医生首先登记治疗。治疗办法：用硫磺熏。令疥疮同志用柴灰（煮）水或肥皂或硫化石灰水，将每个疥痂镊掉（用皮肤镊子）后，再用１％盐水冲洗，就此不穿衣服，坐于小短凳上，用两床棉被以头部以下围严，用８ｇｍ硫磺颗粒，放在器皿内（或者砖瓦都可以）燃着，即放于患者的凳子下，十分钟即燃烧完，再停十至十五分钟不动，然后就将被子裹身，睡热炕上，休息一二小时后，即穿已消过毒的衣服，这样隔一天一次，至多五次，不论什么重疥，均已治愈。
    熏与擦同时进行，更好的快，即熏了休息一二小时后，或者第二次洗后，再擦１０％硫磺膏。这样有三次熏、三次擦，即可全愈。
    必须注意的问题：
    （１）最好有一片手掌大的油纸或油布，再用二、三层布和油纸把阴囊、生殖器包起来，防止皮肤因受刺激而发生的水肿。
    （２）硫磺不宜再多，特别注意燃烧的火焰，不要把皮肤烧伤了。
    （３）用手巾打湿，作如口罩，防止二氧化硫磺刺戟及发生呕吐，呼吸困难的现象。
    （４）围严，不许一点硫化烟钻出来。
    （５）房内空气须流通，且要保持适当的温度，防患感冒。
    四、另外治法：用软膏如１０％硫磺，也有用少许水银与硫磺配合，亦有中药（砒石）与硫磺配合，总之要注意洗干净及擦的办法。
　　灭虱
    一、自军队首长命令后，全体人员都响应了，但还存在着这样一些实际困难：①天冷没有多的衣服换。②蒸又怕打湿或烧了。③下雪天运不回来柴。④拆洗既没线缝、又不得干。以上经行政首长及卫生人员多次解说，和卫生机关自己首先动手，才克服了困难，完成群众性的动员。
    二、灭虱用熏的办法：蒸坑的构造经过许多次的修改，有的二次、有的三次才成功。某一个池边约二尺横直约六尺至七尺，深七尺，周围没有砌砖，锅小气体不大，蒸四小时以上，烧了三百多斤柴，亦未蒸死虱子，又打湿了衣服，致使很多人失去信心。后经改造池周围砌砖，横、直、深、约七尺，池子最少能装两担水（每担六十斤）以上的锅（大行军锅最好），在池墙高三尺五寸左右放一排五根木棍，棍上卦被子衣服，放衣服亦须放好、被子要象整理内务时挂手巾的样形摺三摺横卦棍上，可加五层。七尺横直的池子，可卦八十至一百床棉被，上层还可放四十至六十套棉衣，亦须用棍子架起，切不能摺成背包形状，以防气体透不过。锅内水开了才能卦衣服，不然衣服打湿了。盖子用大门板，门板之下做草帘子，使水蒸气直冲到草帘上以免打湿衣服。门板上面要一点不通气。取时门板打开后，立即将衣服取出，晒十分钟即干。否则气体过冷即变成水会打湿衣服。注意烟囱要做好，锅边要泥好，防止火焰吸到池子里烧衣服。每营做一个就够了，白天蒸被子，晚上蒸衣服。按上述办法。第一锅三小时用一百五十斤柴，第二锅二小时只八十斤硬柴，第三锅一小时有六十斤柴就够了，第四锅一小时效力同前三小时、大虱都死了、一擦成了粉。
    三、四六旅都采取这种办法灭的，四旅十二团三营医助，及二个卫生员，挖了两天，把池子及用具都搞好了，在两天内三个人把全营同志的衣服都蒸了一次，且蒸的好，八团是在火上烤，晚上放在外边冻后用扫帚扫的，结果是不彻底的，虱蛋仍然还在衣服上。
    四、这次虽然没有彻底灭净，但全军卫生人员参观，及几次的修改蒸池，大家对这问题，有了相当的认识，以后有尽心对这个问题会做好的。
　　冻伤裂疮发生的原因预防及治疗
    一、在阳历年前后，没有很好的预防，没讲过一次防治冻疮的课。我们在黄河边上，各部仍然还是每早六时出操刺枪，由于战士新老不一致？刺杀动作不一样，每刺一个动作，三番五次的重来。又因下雪村子内及野外演习，鞋子总不能干，有的单位整天开会，晚上露天看戏，以上种种，因此发生严重的冻疮数目，四旅轻重达八百多人。
    二、预防治疗决定发出后，即于一月六日即通知各单位，早操不刺枪，改为跑步投弹，并不讲姿势用破旧布作手套，大家动员起来防冻。到一月十五号后，大部分治愈。
    三、总结经验教训：①我们对预防工作要忠实，防冻教育要广泛的深入到群众中去。②早期预防：如遇太冷天气，卫生机关应建议首长停止或减少刺枪等暴露手足的活动。并应及早预备些治冻伤药，以便发生冻伤迅速医治。
