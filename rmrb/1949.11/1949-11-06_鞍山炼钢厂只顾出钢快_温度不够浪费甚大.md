　　Anshan Steel Plant Only Cares About Fast Steel Production;
  　Insufficient Temperature Leads to Great Waste
    [Our Newspaper News] Northeast News: Since the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's steel plant launched the creation of new records and the implementation of the bonus system for exceeding quotas, production enthusiasm has been sparked in all shifts, and new records have been created. However, there have also been problems with neglecting quality and serious waste. The appropriate temperature for steelmaking is around 1600 degrees Celsius. However, in order to increase their furnace's output, the open-hearth furnace shifts, as long as the carbon content and other chemical compositions of the steel are up to standard, rush to produce steel regardless of whether the temperature is sufficient. As a result, because the steel temperature is not high enough, the steel quality solidifies, making it difficult to open the tapping hole of the open-hearth furnace. Therefore, oxygen must be used to burn it. Sometimes, eight or ten cylinders of oxygen are used for one furnace. According to statistics, in the first half of October, 166 cylinders of oxygen were used for open-hearth furnace tapping, resulting in significant waste. At the same time, because the steel temperature is low, it used to take only three or four minutes to pour a 60-ton ladle of molten steel, but now it sometimes takes 15 minutes. Since the steel temperature is already low and the time for pouring steel into the ladle is long, the steel temperature is even lower when it reaches the ingot casting crew and they pour steel ingots into the molds. Therefore, oxygen has to be used to burn it again. Also, sometimes the pouring stops in the middle (because the molten steel solidifies). If the time is long, the molten steel poured into the mold first will inevitably solidify. Even if oxygen is used to burn it, the steel that is poured out later cannot be connected into one piece. The molten steel in the mold that is not full becomes scrap (because it is not 1.3 meters high, and the rolling mill cannot roll it). Finally, the solidified steel sticking to the ladle that holds the molten steel weighs at least one ton; the most has been 19 tons. Therefore, between October 1st and 15th, another 140 cylinders of oxygen were used. Also, 284.7 tons of scrap steel ingots were caused due to insufficient steel temperature. After the leadership discovered this waste, they first convened a technical research meeting and criticized the responsible personnel. It was also decided that in the future, steel production will not be allowed if the temperature is not high enough; if there is insufficient gas, it is better to stop one furnace to avoid the phenomenon of each furnace抢ing gas. Since October 16th, results have been achieved in one week. On average, only 0.5 cylinders of oxygen are used per furnace; the solidified steel sticking to the ladle averages just over 0.6 tons. Efforts to overcome this are still continuing.

### 鞍山炼钢厂只顾出钢快　温度不够浪费甚大

　　鞍山炼钢厂只顾出钢快
  　温度不够浪费甚大
    【本报讯】东北消息：鞍山钢铁公司炼钢厂，自开展创造新纪录和试行超额奖励制度以后，各班都掀起了生产热潮，创造了新纪录，但也发生了不注意质量和严重的浪费现象。本来炼钢的温度要在一千六百度左右为合适，但是平炉班的各炉，为了提高自己炉的生产量，只要钢内炭质成份和其他化学成份合格，不管温度够不够，就争先恐后的出钢，结果因为钢的温度不够，钢质发凝，平炉出钢口就很难打开，所以必须得用氧气来烧，有时一炉即用八桶或十桶的氧气，据统计十月份上半月，平炉出钢使用氧气就达一百六十六桶，造成很大浪费。同时还因为钢的温度低，过去淌一罐六十吨的钢水，仅用三、四分钟的时间，但现在有时却用十五分钟。本来钢的温度就低，往罐里淌钢的时间又长，再到造块班往模子里漏钢块时，钢的温度更低，因此还得用氧气来烧；又有时正在漏钢中间，就漏不出来了（因钢水凝住），时间一长先漏在模子里的钢水，势必发凝，就是用氧气烧后，再漏出的钢水也不能接成一块。那个没漏满的模子里的钢水，就变成废块了（因为不够一米三高，轧钢厂不能轧）。最后装钢水的罐里，沾的凝钢最少也有一吨重；最多到过十九吨。因此十月一日至十五日之间，又使用氧气一百四十桶；又因钢的温度不够，而造成的废钢块有二八四·七吨。领导上发觉了这些浪费后，首先召开了技术研究会，并对负责人员进行了批评。又决定：以后如果温度不够，不准出钢；煤气不够，宁可停一个炉，避免各炉乱抢煤气现象。从十月十六日开始，一周间已收到效果。平均一炉仅用○·五桶氧气；罐里沾的凝钢，平均○·六吨强。现还正在继续克服中。
