Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 7th. The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association held a grand meeting at 7:30 tonight to warmly celebrate the 32nd anniversary of the Soviet October Revolution. Participating in this celebration were responsible personnel from the Central People's Government, representatives from all walks of life, personnel from the Soviet Embassy in China, Soviet experts, and representatives from various countries who recently came to Beijing, the capital of China, to attend the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference and the Asian Women's Representative Conference, totaling about one thousand people. Qian Junrui, Secretary-General of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, delivered the opening speech. Liu Shaoqi, President of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, Vice President Guo Moruo, Soviet Ambassador to China Rosen, and Soviet expert leader Kovalev all delivered enthusiastic speeches at the meeting, celebrating the happy life that the October Revolution brought to the Soviet people and the great inspiration it brought to the people of the world, and celebrating the strong friendship between China and the Soviet Union. President Liu Shaoqi said: The victory of the Soviet October Revolution opened the greatest new era in the development of human history and pointed out the path of liberation for all oppressed classes and oppressed nations in the world. After the victory of the Soviet October Revolution, the victory of the Second World Anti-Fascist War was achieved, thus producing many new democratic countries in Europe. The great victory of the Chinese people is another October Revolution that occurred on the land of China. The great revolution of the Chinese people, generally speaking, is still a new democratic revolution against imperialism and feudalism, and not a socialist revolution. However, its world significance is the same as that of the Soviet October Revolution. It has greatly strengthened and expanded the powerful foundation for the continued development of the world revolution. Ambassador Rosen said: The Soviet people are successfully completing the first post-war five-year plan for the restoration and further development of the national economy and are confidently advancing towards communism. The Soviet people are very pleased to watch the heroic struggle of the Chinese people and their success in peaceful construction. The immortal friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union will be consolidated more closely day by day, and this friendship is a bulwark of world peace. The celebration concluded with recreational programs, jointly performed by the China Youth Art Theater, the Hua University Second Art Troupe, Professor Guan Yixuan, and the China Democratic Youth Delegation Art Troupe, including dances, solo performances, and Yangko operas. The celebration ended in infinite joy.

　　中苏友协总会昨晚隆重集会
    欢庆伟大十月革命节
    刘少奇郭沫若罗申柯瓦略夫作热情演说赞扬十月革命巨大影响与中苏坚强友谊
    【新华社北京七日电】中苏友好协会总会今天晚上七点半钟举行隆重集会，热烈庆祝苏联十月革命三十二周年，参加这个庆祝会的有中央人民政府负责人员，各界人民代表，苏联驻我国大使馆人员，苏联专家以及最近来到中国首都北京参加亚洲澳洲工会会议和亚洲妇女代表会议的各国代表共约一千人。中苏友好协会总会总干事钱俊瑞致开会词。中苏友好协会总会会长刘少奇、副会长郭沫若、苏联驻我国大使罗申、苏联专家领导人柯瓦略夫都在会上发表热情的演说，庆祝十月革命带给苏联人民的幸福生活和带给全世界人民的伟大的鼓舞，庆祝中苏两国的坚强友谊。刘少奇会长说：苏联十月革命的胜利，开创了人类历史发展最伟大的新时代，指出了全世界一切被压迫阶级和被压迫民族的解放道路。在苏联十月革命胜利之后，又取得了第二次世界反法西斯战争的胜利，因而产生了欧洲许多新民主主义国家。中国人民的伟大胜利，是在中国这块土地上发生的另一次十月革命。中国人民的大革命从一般的性质上讲，虽然还是反对帝国主义和封建主义的新民主主义的革命，还不是社会主义性质的革命，但是它的世界意义也和苏联十月革命一样，它是极大地加强和扩大了世界革命继续发展过程的强大基础。罗申大使说：苏联人民正在顺利地完成恢复和进一步发展本国国民经济的战后第一个五年计划，正在充满信心地向共产主义前进。苏联人民十分满意地注视中国人民的英勇斗争和他们在和平建设上的成功。中苏两国人民的不朽的友谊将要一天比一天更亲密地巩固起来，这种友谊是全世界和平的堡垒。庆祝会最后并举行游艺节目，由中国青年艺术剧院、华大第二文艺工作团、管喻宜宣教授和中国民主青年代表团文艺工作团联合演出，内容有舞蹈、独唱、秧歌剧等。庆祝会在无限的欢欣中结束。
