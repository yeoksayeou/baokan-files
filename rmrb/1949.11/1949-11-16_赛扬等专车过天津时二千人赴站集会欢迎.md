They then participated in a welcome meeting held next to the station platform. When Saillant and others stepped onto the platform, the crowd cheered and applauded enthusiastically for a long time. After Mayor Huang Jing and Director Huang Huoqing delivered welcoming speeches, Broksal, Vice-Chairman of the WFTU, spoke.
