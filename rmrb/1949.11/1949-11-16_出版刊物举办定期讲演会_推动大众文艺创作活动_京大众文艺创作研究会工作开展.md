　　Work of the Beijing Mass Literary and Artistic Creation Research Association Progresses
　　[Our Newspaper] Since its establishment on October 15th, the Beijing Mass Literary and Artistic Creation Research Association has made new progress in its work. First, it established the work systems for the Organization and Liaison Department, the Creation Department, the Research Department, and the Editorial and Publishing Committee, and carried out the work of developing members and dividing into groups. As of November 15th, it has absorbed a total of 175 members from government agencies, factories, schools, the art world, the education sector, the Peking opera world, the Ping opera world, the Quyi world, the press, and other fields who love literature and art and are interested in research and creation. In addition to dividing into groups by work unit, they are also divided into groups such as fiction, drama, and Quyi according to individual interests. Each group has held several meetings to specifically discuss issues such as the theme and form of a work in progress. After a month of research and preparation, it has been decided to publish a comprehensive mass literary and artistic publication tentatively titled "Talking and Singing," with 60,000 to 80,000 words per issue, including scripts, Quyi creations, storytelling, popular novels, comic strips, etc. The inaugural issue is scheduled to be published in mid-January next year. In addition, in order to maintain close contact with all parties, it has been decided to publish a "Journal" in early December, containing special articles by Zhou Yang, Tian Han, and Yang Shaoxuan. In addition, the association plans to publish "Mass Literature Series," with 50,000 words per issue, selecting and printing better scripts and Quyi, and continuing to enrich the various supplements of the "Xinmin Daily" by publishing a weekly "Mass Literature" in the Tianjin "Progress Times." To this end, the "Mass Creation and Research Association" recently issued a notice to all members, calling for "developing a mass literary and artistic creation movement to welcome a new upsurge in literature and art," and decided to hold regular lectures, inviting writers to talk about the creative experience and various issues of novels, dramas, and Quyi, and to absorb a wide range of people who love literature and art to participate, in order to help everyone improve their writing skills.
