    The Story of the Black Rock Slope Coal Mine (27)
    This time, he ran to the side of the Datong-Puzhou Railway and met Old Bai again, so he went to a mine with Old Bai to work, and the two lived in the same room. But Da San felt that Old Bai had changed again; he didn't talk when nothing was happening, but when something did happen, his words always seemed to have a definite idea. But sometimes he was a little flustered and restless. If he encountered something unpleasant, he would sulk behind his back. He had many friends and many things to do these days, always sending someone out to do things. Sometimes he would send money to a friend, sometimes he would check on someone's illness, or buy or sell something, and sometimes he would be gone for days… Da San couldn't figure out what he was doing. He didn't ask because the other person didn't say, but the other person always told Da San, "Be careful! This is the Japanese's world!" Sometimes when Da San encountered something unsatisfactory and felt angry, Old Bai would advise him, "Don't get angry! Your temper won't work these days! These days, anyone with a little skill or who speaks a little truth is enduring it! You should stay put too, and don't suffer in the short term!" Da San somehow sensed some kind of energy from Old Bai, so he listened to him and stayed put.
    As time went on, Da San also heard from Old Bai that there were still many teams fighting the Japanese in the mountains, and that they were teams of poor people. Some of their former buddies had also joined, and he also heard that the team was called the Eighth Route Army. Some time ago, they attacked the Yangwu Railway Station in Yuanping, Jiaocheng. Da San hurriedly asked, "Don't the Japanese devils say they are bandits?" Old Bai said, "They are fighting him, what else would he call them but bandits? The Japanese devils even call them communist bandits! But they are clearly communists saving the poor!" Da San said, "Communists? That's what they said two years ago, 'Communists kill people like cutting grass'..." Old Bai hurriedly said, "They don't kill anyone, they kill Japanese devils and traitors! That was all Yan Xishan made up to deceive people, because he was afraid that the poor would turn to them!" Then, Old Bai also told Da San: The working class is the most oppressed in the world, and the Communist Party is the party of our workers, leading us to fight the Japanese and oppose oppression. After listening, Da San asked, understandingly and ununderstandingly, "But when will the Communist Party come here to save us?" Old Bai didn't say, only put it off until later. Da San didn't ask anymore, but he felt a little more happy and joyful in his heart.
    After that, the two of them often talked, and Da San slowly learned more things, and his heart was even more joyful. In the winter, Old Bai suddenly told Da San that the Japanese devils had captured a hundred or two people from somewhere and were opening a new kiln in the north of the mine. But those people were very tough: they were allowed to live in earth cave dwellings outside the mine, and soldiers were sent to guard them every day, not allowing them to go out, and not paying them wages, only giving them some coarse grain to eat. Anyone who didn't work hard would be beaten, and if they got sick, they would be dragged out and buried alive before they died… The Japanese devils were also afraid that outsiders would know about this, so they never allowed people from the old mine to go to the north of the mine again. Da San was very angry when he heard this, and hurriedly said, "Do they treat us Chinese as human beings?" Old Bai also just shook his head helplessly. Who knew that this was not the end, and even bigger things happened at the kiln after that.
    Originally, several kilns in this big mine were connected. The roof supports of one of the kilns had been damaged for a long time, and some newly excavated areas had not been supported. The ventilation pipe was also broken. The workers asked several times, but the Japanese devils always ignored them. One day, a little fire broke out at the bottom of the kiln. The coal caught fire as soon as it was burned, and the coal blocks in the unsupported areas collapsed. In an instant, a big fire flew violently, and the fire went straight to the neighboring kilns. The devils were anxious, so they immediately blocked all the ventilation pipes of this kiln, suffocating the fire at the bottom of this one kiln, so as not to damage the other kilns. But there were still fifty or sixty miners who hadn't come up from the bottom of this kiln! The Japanese devils didn't care, and kept shouting, "It's okay! The coolies are working!" At this time, Da San was at the mine. Amidst the chaos, he was so angry that he shouted, "Not letting people come up? Burning Chinese people to death alive? ＠① Damn it, is this okay?" Unexpectedly, his words were heard by a traitor, who immediately reported to the devils. Fortunately, Old Bai was quick-witted. He saw the situation, and immediately pulled Da San out of the mine without saying anything. Da San followed, turning corners and jumping over mounds, and when they reached a secluded place, Old Bai said, "The Japanese know about your words! No, you can't stay! Run quickly, to the east! Hurry!" Old Bai also told him to go to a certain village to find a certain person, and said that he would find Da San later. Finally, he took off his own fur coat and put it on Da San. Da San was both hateful and flustered, and ran around in a panic. He ran until midnight, not knowing where he was, and even forgot the village name and person's name that Old Bai had told him. The next day, he was stopped and questioned by a sentry at a village. He didn't know the situation in this area, so he had to say that he was going home, and they let him go. Where could he go? Go down the kiln for the Japanese again? He was really unwilling to die! But in this area, he was questioned village by village, so he couldn't rush around! Besides, he didn't know if he could find the Eighth Route Army, and if he did, who knew what kind of business he would be doing! Da San thought about it and couldn't help feeling cold in his heart: What's the point of doing anything these days! He might as well go back to his village and be a commoner! And so, Da San headed for Pingding County.

    黑石坡煤窑演义（２７）
    他这回跑到同蒲铁道边，又碰见了老白，就跟老白去一个矿上动弹，二人住一屋。但大三见到老白这人又象变了样儿；他没事不说话，有了事，就出话来总象有个准主意，可有时又有些慌慌张张地坐立不安，碰对了什么不痛快，也会背地里生生气；他这会朋友多事也多，短不了一个人出动，一会是给个朋友捎俩钱，一会是瞧瞧谁谁的病，或是买这卖那，有时又走几天不回……大三闹不清他尽干什么，人家不说，大三也就不问，但人家还总吩咐大三道：“当心些！这可是日本人的天下！”大三有时碰了什么不如意的事，别一肚子气，老白就劝他：“可不敢发火动气！你那脾性这阵子吃不开！这会好赖有点把式讲点直理的，谁不是生生忍着受着？你也好好呆着吧，别吃眼前亏！”大三不知怎么从老白身上觉到股子什么劲气，也就听从他的话，呆下去。
    日子长了，大三也从老白嘴里，听到什么东西边山里还有很多打日本的队伍，那是什么穷人的队伍，他们有些往日的伙计也干上了那，还听说那队伍叫八路军，前些时打崞县原平上阳武车站，就是他们打的；大三忙问：“日本鬼子不说是什么匪军？”老白道：“人家打他嘛，他不说匪还说什么？日本鬼子还骂人家是共匪哩！可人家明明是救穷人的共产党！”大三道：“共产党？就是那二年说的什么‘共产杀人如割草’……”老白忙说：“他杀什么人，他杀日本鬼子杀汉奸！那尽是旧日阎老西怕穷人向人家，编出来哄骗人的！”接着，老白又告给大三：世上就数工人阶级最受压迫，共产党就是咱工人的党，是领导咱打日本、反对压迫的；大三听了，说懂不懂地就又问：“可共产党什么时候到这打救咱们？”老白却不说，只推说往后再捣拉；大三也就不再问，不过他心眼里却痛快了些，高兴了些。
    他二人以后就短不了捣拉，大三慢慢地知道的事情多了，心眼也更痛快些了。这么到了冬天，有一回老白忽然告大三，说是日本鬼子不知从哪里抓来一二百人，在矿北头开新窑，可待那伙人挺厉害：就让他们在矿外边刨土窑洞住，每天还派兵看守，不许他们外出，也不给工钱，光管点杂粮吃，谁不好好干就打，闹了病不等你死就拖去活埋……日本鬼子还怕这事情被外人知道，以后就再也不许老矿上的人往矿北头去。大三听了很生气，忙道：“这是把咱中国人当人看么？”老白也是光摇头没办法。谁知这还不算，窑上接着还出了比这更大的事。
    原来这大矿好几座窑都是通连的，里边有一座窑顶木早坏了，还有些新刨开的地势没支顶木，风筒也坏了；工人要求几次，日本鬼子总不拾掇。有一天，这窑底刨出了一点火，炭一烧就着，顶木坏了的地势炭块一着就乱往下塌，一时大火猛飞，火还直往邻近窑钻；鬼子急了，就立时把这窑的各个风筒堵死，把火闷死在这一个窑底，不让坏了别的窑。但这窑底还有五六十号窑黑没上来呀！日本鬼子不管，还直嚷：“没事的！苦力的干活！”这时大三正在矿上，他在人们慌乱中只气得大喊大叫：“人都不让上来？就活活拿中国人往死里烧？＠①他妈的这还行？”不想他这话被一个汉奸听见了，马上就去报告鬼子。亏得老白眼快，他看出了这情由，立时就什么也没说，拉上大三直往矿外跑，大三跟着拐弯跳垄，到了个僻静地势，老白才说：“你那话日本人知道了！不行，你不能呆了！快跑吧，往东！快！”老白并交代了叫他去什么村找什么人，还说往后他找大三去，最后又把自己身上的皮袄脱下来给大三披上；大三又恨又慌，一阵乱跑，直跑到半夜，也不知到了什么地势，而且连老白交代的村名人名也忘了。第二天，他被一个村站岗的卡住了盘问，他又闹不清这地势的情况，只好说他是回家的，人家才放了他。他上哪里去啊？再给日本人下窑？实在死不甘心！可这地势又是走一村盘问一村的，没法乱闯！再说也不知寻上寻不上八路军的，寻上了吧，可谁知尽得干些什么营生！大三左思右想，又不禁心中发冷：这年月，还干球什么啊！回他妈村去当土老百姓吧！大三就这么着往平定县走了。
