Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 1st dispatch by TASS: The Soviet Union's food production continues to grow. The food industry victoriously completed the third quarter production plan this year, and the production of sugar is almost twice as much as the same period last year; sausage production increased by 42 percent, butter production increased by 36 percent, and so on. The achievements of socialist agriculture have greatly helped the successful completion of the third quarter production plan. The farmers of the collective farms harvested large quantities of grain, beets, fruits, and vegetables, providing food factories with a large supply of agricultural raw materials. On the other hand, the Soviet government attaches great importance to the development of the food industry, and has allocated a large amount of funds this year to build new factories and equip these enterprises with the latest machinery. At the beginning of this quarter, new sugar refineries have been completed in Ukraine, Moldavia, and the Russian Federation. In addition, the increase in livestock production in collective farms and state-owned farms has guaranteed the supply of raw materials for the meat industry and the cheese industry. New meat packing factories and cheese factories equipped with modern machinery have been completed this year in Siberia, Ukraine, and Belarus. The thirty-three butter trusts, competing to complete the production plan ahead of schedule, have already completed their annual production plan ahead of schedule.

　　苏食品工业伟大成就
    与去年同期相较糖增加两倍新食品工厂添装大量新机器
    【新华社北京一日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联食物生产继续在增长着。食品工业胜利地完成了本年第三季的生产计划，并且，所生产的糖几乎有去年同期两倍之多；香肠生产增加了百分之四十二，奶油生产增加了百分之三十六等等。社会主义农业的成就，对第三季生产计划的胜利完成是有很大帮助的。集体农场的农民收割了大量的谷物，甜菜、水果和菜蔬，使食品工厂得到大量农产原料的供给。另一方面，苏联政府很重视食品工业的发展，在本年度拨付了大笔款项来建设新的工厂，并以最新的机器来装备这些企业。在这一季刚开始时，新的炼糖厂已经在乌克兰、摩达维亚和俄罗斯联邦落成了。此外，在集体农场和国营农场中畜产的增加，保证了肉类工业及乳酪工业之原料供给。装备着现代机器的新的肉类包装工厂和乳酪工厂，今年已经在西伯利亚、乌克兰和白俄罗斯落成。为提早完成生产计划而进行竞赛的三十三个奶油托拉斯，已经先期完成了他们的一年生产计划。
