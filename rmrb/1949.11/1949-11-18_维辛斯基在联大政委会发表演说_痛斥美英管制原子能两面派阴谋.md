　　Vyshinsky Delivers Speech at the UN Political Committee
    Denouncing the US-UK Two-Faced Conspiracy to Control Atomic Energy
  　　　　　The American Control Plan Deprives Science of Freedom
    According to the American plan, only international institutions have the right to conduct scientific investigations and development work on atomic weapons and the utilization of atomic energy.
    What conclusion can be drawn from this? Vyshinsky pointed out that every country that has abandoned its independence for the sake of the "supreme tranquility" that the drafters of the American plan speak of—that is, saving humanity from the horrors of atomic warfare—has placed a huge bet. But doesn't this exactly fit the American plan? And isn't this plan bound to infringe on national sovereignty, prevent each country from using atomic energy, stifle scientific research on atomic energy, and stifle (no one can doubt this) any opportunity to use atomic energy for peaceful purposes?
    In the Soviet Union, we use atomic energy not to stockpile atomic bombs, although I have no doubt that if, unfortunately, atomic bombs are ever needed, we will have as many atomic bombs as necessary. We use atomic energy according to our economic plans and our economic interests. We want to use atomic energy to realize the great tasks of our peaceful construction, to blast mountains, change river courses, irrigate deserts, and open up new paths of life in places where human footprints are rare. We do this according to our plans as masters of our country, and we have no obligation to submit or provide reports on such matters to any international institution.
    　　　　The Uselessness of the American Control Plan
    The American control plan justifies the provision of transferring ownership to international control institutions with the main argument that atomic energy control and supervision would not be effective in any other way or under any other system.
    The Five-Nation Statement pointed out: The manufacture of atomic fuel is so complex that even with supervision, concealment cannot be prevented, and—I quote from this report—...it is impossible to investigate whether the actual quantity of atomic material inside the uranium reactor matches the quantity indicated in the records.
    The representatives of the five nations criticized the Soviet Union's suggestion of regularly inspecting factories that produce atomic energy, etc. They declared that a single inspection system is not enough, and therefore all atomic raw materials and atomic factories must be handed over to international control institutions.
    The Five-Nation Statement claimed that the Soviet Union's proposals "are far from guaranteeing the required security, and on the contrary, are so imperfect that these proposals are dangerous." But the representatives of the five nations did not bother to explain to us what was imperfect about the Soviet proposals. Is it because of regular control? Is it because control should not be exercised when doubts arise about the decisions of the international control institutions themselves? Is it because of these things that the Soviet proposals are said to be insufficient? Is it because there is no veto power in this institution? This point was later used by many Americans who opposed the Soviet plan (they insisted that the Soviet Union did not want to open the door to supervision) to scare people. But the supervision that the Soviet Union understands is not the same as what some gentlemen who want to sit at the table with their feet up understand. We do not approve of this attitude.
    Vyshinsky said: It must be stated bluntly that all these arguments that the Soviet control plan is dangerous are absolutely unfounded. I want to talk about Mr. Barnard (former member of the US Atomic Energy Commission—Editor's note), who claimed: "Controlling atomic bombs will not be as difficult as controlling other types of weapons."
    I would like to emphasize that there are now more and more people who believe that the problem of atomic control is far simpler than the problem of controlling chemicals and the like. However, although enterprises that manufacture poison gas have not been handed over to so-called international control institutions, doesn't the convention banning the use of poison gas still exist? Vyshinsky continued: My criticism of the American plan is not yet finished, and the proponents of this plan are trying to deceive us into accepting it. I would also like to mention Barnard, who admitted that the American plan believes that the United States can abandon the atomic bomb under certain conditions—that is, it must be considered that countries have put forward thorough and sincere guarantees to ensure that countries will finally refuse to use atomic energy as a weapon before the United States abandons the atomic bomb.
    "What does this mean?" Barnard asked. The reply was: "This inevitably means that other countries must voluntarily and gradually give up a considerable part of their sovereignty before the United States abandons the atomic bomb." I would also like to quote a sentence from this Barnard: "It is difficult to imagine smooth negotiations between proud and equal countries under relatively unfavorable conditions."
    Barnard admitted—according to current newspaper reports, this is his personal confession—that as early as 1946, he was very clear that the chances of the American plan being passed were very slim.
    　　　　The American Control Plan Deceives the Whole World
    Moreover, the report of the Atomic Energy Commission itself says that the decision on when the United States will stop producing atomic bombs will depend on considerations of supreme policy, and the report also says that this decision should be made by the US government "in accordance with constitutional procedures and with reference to all aspects of the international situation." This is an extremely important statement that reveals the true meaning of the entire American plan. This plan was drafted by Mr. Acheson, Bush, Conant, Groves, and McCloy with the participation of the advisory committee composed of Barnard, Oppenheimer, Thomas, Vinny, and chaired by Lilienthal.
    In order to explain where the problem actually lies, I will continue to quote the preface to the report submitted by the advisory committee chaired by Lilienthal to former US Secretary of State Byrnes through Acheson and others. The preface reads: One of these decisions will involve the length of time that the United States continues to produce atomic bombs. The plan does not stipulate that the United States stop this production after the plan is proposed or after the international institution begins to operate. Vyshinsky continued, I also quote from it that at some stage or other, it is necessary to stop the production of atomic bombs, but whether we implement this plan or abandon this plan, it should not be interpreted as atomic bomb production must be stopped from the beginning or at any given time.
    If the authors of the American so-called international control plan, headed by Acheson and Lilienthal, have put forward a control plan that prohibits the use of atomic energy for atomic bomb production, and yet do not intend to stop atomic bomb production themselves after this plan is passed, then I want to ask: What does all this plan mean? The United States does not intend to stop the production of atomic bombs after its plan is passed, which is stated clearly in the report. This is the first point.
    The meaning of the American plan is: regardless of whether the international control convention (which must stipulate the prohibition of the use of atomic energy for military purposes) has been implemented by then, the United States itself will decide when it can stop the production of atomic bombs. This is the second point.
    It means that the decision on stopping atomic bomb production must not fall within the scope of the so-called control plan of the United States, this is the third point.
    Finally, it means that: since the American plan does not stipulate that the United States stop the production of atomic bombs, but only stipulates that control be implemented in the stage of obtaining raw materials, only those countries that have not yet mastered the production of atomic bombs are subject to this control. This plan has nothing to do with the United States, which considers itself to have a monopoly on atomic bomb production.
    　　　　National Sovereignty and the American Dream of Ruling the World
    The Soviet Union has repeatedly pointed out that it is absolutely necessary to limit a certain part of national sovereignty to some extent in certain circumstances on the basis of reciprocity and international cooperation.
    The whole issue does not deny the self-evident and universally recognized fact that every agreement requires the parties to the contract to limit each other, and it is also essential to abide by this principle in international agreements. The key lies in the question of degree, in the degree of this restriction on national sovereignty, and only autonomous and equal parties—states—can talk about the word restriction. However, the proponents of the American plan are silent on exactly this point.
    Based on the above regarding this plan, it should be clear that the issue is not about abolishing certain sovereignties as asserted by the representatives of the five countries, but about completely abolishing the sovereignty of all other countries.
    This is the crux of the problem. This is the fundamental obstacle to reaching an agreement on the American so-called international control plan.
    Vyshinsky continued: Until recently, the illusion of monopolizing atomic energy has played an important role in the US government's position on the atomic issue, and the United States thought—I should say—that it had atomic superiority in the world. Therefore, in my opinion, the US government was arrogant when considering this issue and when consulting with its partners on resolving the atomic issue. Now the baselessness of this arrogant attitude has become absolutely clear.
    　　　　The Soviet Union Demands the Prohibition of Atomic Weapons and the Establishment of Strict International Control
    The Soviet government has been making unremitting efforts to take genuine and thorough measures to ban atomic weapons and establish, as Marshal Stalin said, strict international control to prevent the use of atomic energy for military purposes.
    The proposal put forward by the Soviet Union on June 11, 1947, started from the necessity of immediately and unconditionally banning atomic weapons. The prohibition of atomic weapons is an inseparable part of the peace program followed and maintained by the Soviet Union, and it is an inseparable part of such a peace program that the Soviet government has maintained in the past and is still maintaining now, regardless of which side has the advantage in the true balance of power, regardless of whether the Soviet Union knows the secret of atomic weapons or possesses atomic weapons.
    Starting from the principled position of maintaining peace and consolidating world security, starting from the recognition that members of the United Nations must not use atomic weapons, and starting from the recognition that the use of atomic weapons is contrary to the honor and conscience of all countries, the Soviet government has firmly and unswervingly advocated for many years, and now firmly and unswervingly advocates banning atomic weapons, and has urged in the past and is now urging the immediate abolition of this aggressive and barbaric weapon from the armaments of all countries.
    Although the Soviet government has possessed atomic weapons, it adheres to and will adhere to the position it held before of unconditionally prohibiting the use of this weapon. The Soviet government also adheres to its previous position on controlling atomic weapons, and it believes that this control is necessary to inspect the implementation of the resolution prohibiting the manufacture of atomic weapons.
    Starting from this principled position, the Soviet government suggested two years ago to conclude a convention banning atomic weapons and a convention establishing strict international control.
    These proposals were opposed by the majority of this committee.
    However, this cannot prevent us, the Soviet people, from continuing to wage an irreconcilable struggle for these proposals, and these proposals are truly saving humanity from the threat of a new, terrible, and inhumane atomic war.

### 维辛斯基在联大政委会发表演说  痛斥美英管制原子能两面派阴谋

　　维辛斯基在联大政委会发表演说
    痛斥美英管制原子能两面派阴谋
  　　　　　美国管制计划剥夺科学的自由
    依照美国的计划，唯有国际机构才有权进行科学调查与发展原子武器及原子能的利用上的工作。
    这可得出什么结论来呢？维辛斯基指出，就是每一个为了美国计划的拟订者所说的“最高安宁”——即拯救人类不受原子战争的恐怖——而放弃其独立的国家已投下了巨额的赌注。但是这不是正好符合美国的计划吗？而这个计划不是势必侵犯国家主权、不让每个国家使用原子能、窒息原子能的科学的研究工作，而且窒息（谁也不能够怀疑这一点）任何将原子能用于和平的机会吗？
    在苏联，我们使用原子能不是为了储存原子弹，虽然我一点也不怀疑，假若不幸一旦需要原子弹时，我们将会有必需的那样多的原子弹。我们是按照我们的经济计划和我们的经济利益使用原子能的。我们要利用原子能来实现我们和平建设的伟大任务，来炸开山岳，改变河道，灌溉沙漠，在人类足迹罕到之地开辟生活的新的道路。我们是作为我们国家的主人按照我们的计划来这样做的，而且我们没有义务把关于这种事情的报告提交或供给任何国际机构。
    　　　　美国管制计划的无用
    规定把所有权交给国际管制机构，美国管制计划为这一计划辩护的主要论据是：原子能管制和监督在任何其他的方式和任何其他的制度中都不会是有效的。
    五国声明指出：制造原子燃料是这样复杂，即使实行监督也不能防止隐瞒，而且——我引用这个报告中的话——…………要调查铀作用器里面的原子材料的实际数量与记录中所指明的数量是否符合是不可能的事。
    五国代表批评苏联所提定期检查制造原子能工厂等等的建议，它们宣称只有一个检查制度是不够的，因此必须将所有原子原料和原子工厂交给国际管制机构所有。
    五国声明称：苏联的建议“远不能保证所需要的安全，而且相反地是如此不完善，以至于这些建议具有危险性”。但五国代表并没有劳神给我们解释一下，苏联建议到底是那里不完善。是因为定期管制吗？是在对国际管制机构本身的决定发生怀疑时不该加以管制吗？是不是因为这一些就说苏联的建议不够呢？是不是因为这个机构中没有否决权呢？这一点后来被美国许多反对苏联计划的人（他们硬说苏联不想打开监督之门）用来吓唬人。但是苏联所了解的监督并不象某些想坐在桌子前两脚架在上面的先生们所了解的那样。我们不赞成这种态度。
    维辛斯基说：必须直截了当地说，所有这些说苏联管制计划有危险性的争辩，都是绝对无根据的。我要谈一谈巴纳德先生（前美国原子能委员会委员——编者注），他声称：“管制原子弹不会象管制其他种类的武器那样困难。”
    我愿意着重指出：认为原子管制问题远较对化学品之类的管制问题简单得多的人现在愈来愈多了。但是，虽然制造毒气的企业并没有交归所谓国际管制机构所有，禁止使用毒气的公约现在岂不是一样地存在吗？维辛斯基继续说：我对美国计划的批评还没有说完，这个计划的主持人企图用欺骗手段使我们接受它。我还要提到巴纳德，他承认，美国计划认为美国在一定的条件下可以放弃原子弹——这就是必须考虑了各国所提出的彻底而真诚的保证，确保各国最后将拒绝利用原子能作武器之后，美国才放弃原子弹。
    “这是什么意思呢？”巴纳德问道。答复是：“这不可避免地意味着其他国家必须在美国放弃原子弹之前，先自愿地渐渐放弃相当大部分的主权。”我还要引用这位巴纳德的一句话来说：“骄傲与平等的国家之间，在比较不好的条件下进行顺利的谈判是很难想象的。”
    巴纳德承认——根据目前报纸的报道，这是他亲自供认的——他在一九四六年就已经很明白，美国计划获得通过的机会已经很少了。
    　　　　美国的管制计划欺诈全世界
    况且，原子能委员会的报告本身说，关于美国什么时候停止原子弹生产问题的决定将取决于对最高政策的考虑，而且这个报告又说，这个决定应由美国政府“按照宪法手续并参照各方面的国际情况”来制定。这一点是极端重要的声明，它透露了整个美国计划的真实意义。这个计划是由艾奇逊、布奇、康南特、葛罗夫斯与麦克洛埃这几位先生在巴纳德、奥本海麦、汤姆斯、文尼所组成的、由李连塞尔担任主席的咨询委员会的参加之下起草的。
    为了要说明问题实际在什么地方，我将继续引用由李连塞尔担任主席的咨询委员会经由艾奇逊等人向美国前国务卿贝尔纳斯提出的报告的前言。前言写道：这种决定之一将牵涉美国继续进行原子弹生产期间之长短。该计划并未规定在提出该计划之后或在国际机构开始活动之后美国停止这种生产。维辛斯基继续说，我还引用它里面的话，即在某个阶段或其他阶段，停止原子弹的生产是必要的，但无论我们实行这个计划或放弃这个计划，都不应解释为从一开头起或在任何一定的时间原子弹生产必须停止还是不停止。
    如果以艾奇逊和李连塞尔为首的美国所谓国际管制计划的作者们提出了一个不准使用原子能进行原子弹生产的管制计划，而又一点也不打算在这个计划通过之后美国自己也一定要停止原子弹生产，那末我要问：所有这些计划究竟是什么意思呢？美国并没有打算在它的计划通过之后停止原子弹的生产，这是报告上说得明明白白的。这是第一点。
    美国计划的意思是：不管国际管制公约（它必须规定禁止将原子能用作军事目的）到那时业已付诸实行，但是，美国什么时候才能停止原子弹生产的问题，要由美国自己来决定。这是第二点。
    它意味着关于停止原子弹生产的决定必须不属于美国的所谓管制计划的范围之内，这是第三点。
    最后一点，它意味着：由于美国的计划并未规定美国停止原子弹生产，而只规定仅在取得原料的阶段中实行管制，所以只有那些尚未掌握原子弹生产的国家才受这种管制。这个计划与自认为垄断着原子弹生产的美国无关。
    　　　　各国的主权与美国统治世界的梦想
    苏联已一再指出：在互惠与国际合作的利益的基础上，在某些情形之下对于国家主权的某一部分或在某种程度上加以限制是绝对必要的。
    整个问题丝毫不否认理所当然的并已为大家所承认了的事实，即每一个协议要求订约的各方彼此有所限制，同时在国际协议上遵守这一原则也是必不可免的。关键在于程度问题，在于这种对国家主权的限制的程度问题，只有自主与平等的当事者——国家才谈得上限制这两个字。然而，美国计划建议人默默无言的正是这一点。
    根据上述关于这个计划的一切，应该明白：问题不在于象五国代表所断言的取消某些主权，而是完全取消其他一切国家的主权。
    这是问题的根本所在。这就是阻挠在美国的所谓国际管制的计划之上获致协议的根本障碍。
    维辛斯基继续说：直到不久以前，垄断原子能的幻想在美国政府关于原子问题的立场上曾起过重要的作用，美国自以为——我应该说——在全世界有原子优势。因此，在我看来，美国政府在考虑这个问题时，在和他的伙友商谈解决原子问题时是傲慢的。现在这种傲慢态度的毫无根据，已绝对明明白白的了。
    　　　　苏联要求禁止原子武器，建立严格的国际管制
    苏联政府坚持不懈地努力，以求采取真正而彻底的措施来禁止原子武器和建立象斯大林大元帅所说的严格的国际管制，不准把原子能用于军事目的上。
    一九四七年六月十一日苏联所提出的建议，就是从立刻和无条件地禁止原子武器这一必要性出发的。禁止原子武器是苏联所遵循和维护的和平方案的不可分的部分，是苏联政府不管那一方面在力量的真正对比上占优势，不管苏联是否知道原子武器的秘密或拥有原子武器，而在过去维护过、现在仍在维护的这样一个和平方案的不可分的部分。
    从维护和平、巩固世界安全的原则立场出发，从承认联合国会员国不得利用原子武器出发，从承认使用原子武器就是和各国的荣誉和良心相抵触这一事实出发，苏联政府多年以来就坚决不渝地主张，而且现在也坚决不渝地主张禁止原子武器，过去就力促而且现在也力促立刻从各国的军备中废除这一侵略和野蛮的武器。
    苏联政府虽然已握有原子武器，但它却坚守着而且今后也要坚守以前所持的那种无条件禁止使用这一武器的立场。苏联政府也坚持以前关于管制原子武器的立场，她认为这种管制对于检查禁止制造原子武器这一决议之执行来说是必要的。
    从这种原则立场出发，苏联政府两年以前就曾建议缔结禁止原子武器的公约和缔结建立严格的国际管制的公约。
    这些建议遭受到本委员会多数方面的反对。
    但是，这并不能阻碍我们苏联人民，继续为这些建议进行不调和的斗争，而这些建议是真正地拯救人类免于新的、可怖的、不人道的原子战争之威胁的。
