　　The Anti-Imperialist Forces of the Indian Working Class Are Rapidly Growing in Heroic Struggle
    Indian Representative Shelvankar Reports on the Work of the All-India Trade Union Congress
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 20th] Shelvankar, Secretary of the All-India Trade Union Congress, reported today at the Asian and Australian Trade Union Conference on the work of the Indian trade unions. He recounted the heroic deeds of the Indian working class in its struggle against the imperialists, and the rapid growth of the All-India Trade Union Congress. He said: Before the war, in 1939, 188 trade unions with 365,000 members joined the All-India Trade Union Congress; now the trade unions affiliated with the All-India Trade Union Congress have increased to 600, with membership increasing to 800,000. The growth of the Indian working class has developed under the deepening economic crisis and the high-pressure policies of the Nehru reactionary government. According to official statistics, the retail price index for food in India, taking 1939 as 100, has now risen to 416; the profits of capitalists are rising, but the real wages of the working people are falling. Two million industrial workers are now either fully or partially unemployed. In order to shift the burden of the economic crisis onto the working class and the people, the capitalists have adopted a bloody, fascist-style offensive, imprisoning 25,000 democratic leaders and worker activists, and hundreds of male and female workers have sacrificed their lives. Peasant fighters under the leadership of the working class have also been arrested in large numbers and sent to concentration camps, and villages have been burned down one after another.
    However, despite the bloody suppression by the Nehru government, the Indian working class and the peasants under the leadership of the working class are fighting with heroic and unprecedented self-sacrificing spirit. Since Nehru came to power in 1947, Indian workers have staged 4,500 strikes, and the number of strikes has increased year by year. In the first half of 1949, capitalists lost 3.7 million working days. Shelvankar cited many examples of the heroic struggle of Indian workers and Nehru's military police. In July of this year, when workers, peasants, students, writers, artists, and teachers in Dibrugarh, Assam Province, held a peace conference, Nehru sent 1,000 troops to surround the venue, and officers demanded to enter the venue to inspect the delegates. The defenders of peace rejected this mad request. So the officer ordered the troops to rush in the gate, and four male workers and four female workers were killed on the spot, and hundreds of workers and students were injured. Disregarding the danger to their lives, the representatives continued to fight for two hours, seriously injuring dozens of reactionary troops and killing two junior officers. After the incident, democratic forces in India and around the world fiercely condemned this atrocity. In response to the reactionaries, the All-India Trade Union Congress specially issued a call to hold the All-India Peace Congress in the heroic city of Calcutta on November 24.
    Shelvankar then described the activities of the Indian guerrillas and the heroic deeds of guerrilla fighter Leti. In Hyderabad, India, there is a guerrilla force of 30,000 people who have liberated 5 million peasants. One day, the eighteen-year-old guerrilla fighter Leti was injured, lying on the grass, running a high fever. Nehru's 30 armed police officers arrived near him, but did not dare to catch him. They forced the villagers to tie up Leti's hands and feet, and asked him: "Where is the headquarters of the Communist Party? Where is the headquarters of the guerrillas?" Comrade Leti refused to answer any questions. Nehru's lackeys took out their pistols and shot him, and Leti answered the executioners with angry shouts: "Long live the guerrillas!" "Long live the Communist Party!" "You can kill me, but you cannot kill my party! Long live Ranadive (General Secretary of the Communist Party of India)!" He sacrificed himself the fifth time he was shot!
    Shelvankar emphasized: The heroic struggle of the Indian working people is inspired by the great Soviet Union, by the beloved neighbor - the warriors of China, by the revolutionary movements of the people of Southeast Asian countries, and by the warriors of the world's democratic camp. "We want to follow Mao Zedong's road!" This sentence has become the battle slogan of the Indian working class. The US and British imperialists ordered Nehru to replace Chiang Kai-shek, but the comrades of New China defeated Chiang Kai-shek. This great victory has frightened Nehru and its government!
    Finally, Shelvankar pointed out: The current tasks of the All-India Trade Union Congress are to carry out trade union work under illegal conditions, to quickly organize the unemployed, and to organize agricultural laborers; at the same time, we must concentrate our efforts to unite the ranks of the working class, because only a unified working class can establish a national democratic front. He guaranteed that the Indian working class must stand shoulder to shoulder with the great Soviet Union, the great China, and the guerrillas of Southeast Asian countries, under the banner of the World Federation of Trade Unions, to realize these tasks.

　　印度工人阶级反帝力量在英勇斗争中迅速增长
    印代表谢尔凡卡报告全印工会工作
    【新华社北京二十日电】全印职工大会书记谢尔凡卡，今日在亚洲、澳洲工会会议上报告印度工会工作。他叙述了印度工人阶级和帝国主义者作斗争的英雄事迹，和全印工人大会力量的迅速增长。他说：在战前一九三九年，加入全印工人大会的有一八八个工会，三十六万五千会员；现在全印工人大会所属的工会，已经增加到六百个，会员增加到八十万。印度工人阶级力量的壮大，是在日益加深的经济危机和尼赫鲁反动政府的高压政策下发展起来的。据官方的统计，印度粮食的零售物价指数，以一九三九年为一百，则现在已涨到四一六；资本家的利润在上升，劳动人民的实际工资却在下降。现在已经有二百万产业工人全部或部分失业了。资本家为了把经济危机的重担转嫁在工人阶级和人民的身上，采取了流血的、法西斯式的进攻，把二万五千个民主领袖和工人积极分子关进了监狱，数百个男女工人已经献出了他们的生命。在工人阶级领导下的农民战士，也大批地被抓进了集中营，农村一个接着一个被烧毁。
    但是，尽管尼赫鲁政府进行血腥的镇压，印度工人阶级和在工人阶级领导下的农民，正在以英勇的、前所未有的自我牺牲精神进行战斗。自从一九四七年尼赫鲁上台以来，印度工人已经进行了四千五百次罢工，罢工次数逐年增加。一九四九年的上半年，资本家损失了三百七十万个工作日。谢尔凡卡列举了很多印度工人和尼赫鲁军警英勇斗争的例子。在今年七月，阿萨姆省狄不鲁加的工人和农民、学生、作家、艺术家和教师，举行保卫和平大会的时候，尼赫鲁派出一千名军队包围了会场，军官要求进入会场检查代表。和平的保卫者拒绝了这一疯狂的要求。于是军官就命令军队冲进大门，当场有四个男工和四个女工被打死，数百个工人和学生受伤。代表们不顾生命危险，继续战斗了两小时，几十个反动军队受了重伤，两个下级军官被打死。事件发生以后，印度和全世界的民主力量，猛烈地斥责这个暴行。全印工人大会，为着回答反动派，特别发出号召，要在十一月二十四日在英雄的加尔各答城举行全印度和平大会。
    谢尔凡卡接着又叙述印度游击队的活动和游击队员莱蒂的英勇事迹。在印度海德拉巴，有一支三万人的游击队，他们已经解放了五百万农民。有一天，十八岁的游击队员莱蒂受了伤，躺在草地上，发着高烧。尼赫鲁的三十名武装警察到了他附近，但是不敢去捉他，他们强迫村民把莱蒂的手脚捆起来，并且问他：“共产党的总部在那里？游击队的总部在那里？”莱蒂同志拒绝回答任何问题。尼赫鲁的走狗就掏出手枪来射击，莱蒂以忿怒的高呼来回答刽子手：“游击队万岁！”“共产党万岁”！“你们可以杀死我，但是你们不能杀死我的党！兰那地夫（印共总书记）万岁”！第五次开枪的时候，他便牺牲了！
    谢尔凡卡强调地说：印度劳动人民的英勇斗争，是从伟大的苏联，从敬爱的邻邦——中国的战士，从东南亚各国人民的革命运动，从世界民主阵营的勇士们得到启示的。“我们要走毛泽东的道路！”这句话成为了印度工人阶级的战斗口号，美英帝国主义者命令尼赫鲁代替蒋介石，但新中国的同志们战胜了蒋介石。这伟大的胜利，已经使得尼赫鲁和它的政府惊慌失措了！
    最后，谢尔凡卡指出：全印职工大会目前的任务，就是在非法的情况下进行工会工作，迅速地组织失业人员，组织农业劳动者；同时，还必须集中精力，团结工人阶级的队伍，因为只有统一的工人阶级才能建立起全国的民主阵线。他保证：印度工人阶级一定要和伟大的苏联、伟大的中国和东南亚各国的游击队员，肩并肩地，在世界工联旗帜下，去实现这些任务。（附图片）
