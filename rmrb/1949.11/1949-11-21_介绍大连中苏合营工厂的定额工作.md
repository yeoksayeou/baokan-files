Introducing the Quota Work of Sino-Soviet Joint Venture Factories in Dalian
　　Zhao Disheng
　　Quota work is one of the most important keys to establishing a scientific production management system. The so-called quota means determining the standard quality of a certain product based on a certain technical level and technical equipment, determining the standard quantity of raw materials used to produce the product, determining the standard number of personnel used to produce the product, determining the standard production time for producing a certain product, determining the standard quantity of products produced by using a certain machine in a certain period, determining the standard quantity of various expenses, determining the depreciation of machines, etc. Among these, the first five are particularly important. Obtaining such quotas is an extremely complicated task. However, if these quotas are not obtained, scientific calculations cannot be made for enterprise production, economic accounting cannot be carried out, and the so-called reduction of costs and, correspondingly, improvement of workers' lives and implementation of a reasonable progressive wage system will not have a solid basis. Factories in Dalian, especially the Sino-Soviet joint venture factories in Dalian, have now made considerable achievements in quota work.
　　The Far East Electric Industry Company Paint Factory, a Sino-Soviet joint venture in Dalian, solved the quota issue in the following order:
　　First, the quality quota. The amount and quality of raw materials used by the factory, as well as the size of output, are all determined by a certain degree of quality standard. The factory's main product is paint (oil paste), and the raw materials used are oil, dyes, and hu powder (a kind of stone powder). When the factory resumed production in 1946, the main technology was still in the hands of Japanese technicians, and these technicians had very low production morale or were even engaging in sabotage. The source of dyes (which mainly relied on Japan in the past) was also cut off, and local raw materials (red soil, white soil, etc.) had to be used instead. At that time, if the quality standards of the Japanese occupation period were still used, it would obviously be impossible. After several experiments, the factory determined the secondary products during the Japanese rule as the standard, as the quality quota. However, after two or three years of assistance from Soviet technicians, the technical level of Chinese workers in manufacturing paint has greatly improved; in addition, the enemy's blockade has been broken, so since this year, the factory has been able to formulate quality quotas in accordance with Soviet paint standards, making the quality of finished products exceed the highest level of the Japanese occupation era. Naturally, accepting a higher quality standard was resisted in the minds of a few conservative workers, because manufacturing higher-quality products requires more effort. In order to mobilize workers to produce higher-quality products, factory managers have promptly carried out effective educational and persuasive work.
　　Second, the raw material usage quota. The correct handling of this link has a significant impact on eliminating waste of materials and reducing costs. The raw material usage quota of the paint factory is determined based on a certain finished product quality quota, the quality of the raw materials themselves, and the technical conditions within the factory. In particular, the improvement of workers' technical proficiency has a particularly significant effect on reducing the consumption of raw materials. In the past, the paint factory needed a raw material quota of 103 kilograms to produce 100 kilograms of paint (of which hu powder accounted for 50 percent, dye accounted for about 30 percent, and oil accounted for about 20 percent); since this year, the raw material usage quota has been reduced to 101 kilograms. Calculated on the basis of the factory's daily output of 25 tons of paint, the daily use of raw materials is saved by 500 kilograms compared to before. Now, only 100.8 kilograms are actually used, which is still 0.2 kilograms less than the quota. However, the saving of raw materials is only meaningful if it is under the premise of ensuring quality standards. In the past, the paint factory once reduced the quality of its products due to the one-sided pursuit of raw material savings.
　　Third, the personnel quota (also called "staffing"). The personnel quota of the paint factory is determined based on the actual needs when the machine efficiency is fully utilized; at the same time, workers of different technical levels are equipped according to the quality requirements. The staffing of the paint factory is calculated in production groups as a unit. For example, watching the grinding machine is an important part of manufacturing paint. Each shift (eight hours) requires four people to take care of it, and the output is about two tons, requiring two tons and twenty kilograms of raw materials. Therefore, two workers are designated to carry raw materials. According to the output, two workers are also needed for filling barrels and brushing barrels. In this way, the personnel quota for a group is eight people. One of them is the group leader, who must have high technical skills and the ability to lead the group, and should be designated as a seventh-grade worker; another person is required to act as the group leader when necessary, and is designated as a sixth-grade worker; the rest are equipped with six workers of different grades according to the nature of production.
　　Fourth, the time quota (also called "timing"). The timing of the paint factory is calculated based on machine efficiency, product type and quality, and workers' technical level. For example, one ton of paint requires a total of 1,010 kilograms of raw materials, and the capacity of each machine is about 160 kilograms per grinding, which takes 40 minutes each time. In this way, it is calculated that it takes 252 minutes to manufacture one ton of paint, that is to say, the timing for manufacturing one ton of paint is 4.12 minutes. In actual work, the paint factory grasps the timing by grasping the inspection of quantity, because the daily (eight hours) production quota of 1.87 tons for a grinding machine (the actual output is an average of two tons) contains the timing factor. However, whether the timing is scientific and reasonable has a great impact on the accuracy of the quantity. Therefore, it is very important for factory managers to seek further correctness of the quantity from the accurate accounting of timing.
　　Fifth, the production quota (also called "quantity"). This is formulated after experiments based on the finished product quality quota, machine efficiency, the number of labor used and their technical conditions, and the difficulty of production, and with reference to the average output during the Japanese occupation period. For example, there are seven grinding machines in the paint workshop, and because they are of different sizes, the quotas are also different. The maximum efficiency of the No. 1 grinding machine in the past was 1,800 kilograms per shift, with an average of 1,295 kilograms. After the experiment, the determined quota was 1,200 to 1,300 kilograms. The No. 2 grinding machine is smaller, so it is set at 1,080 kilograms to 1,200 kilograms. For example, the manufacture of polychromatic oil paste is more labor-intensive than monochromatic oil paste, so its quota is only set at 900 kilograms to 1,080 kilograms.
　　After the various quotas are determined, the factory planning department will use this to formulate the annual production plan, calculate the consumption quantity of raw materials, and make a cost plan based on its price (uniformly stipulated by the enterprise's financial department every year, not affected by market prices, to facilitate cost accounting), workers' wages, and other factory expenses, and submit it to the superior enterprise for approval. Then the factory will cooperate with the trade union to distribute the production plan to various workshops and groups, and the workers will discuss how to complete and exceed it, turning it into specific plans for each department. The problems that need to be solved raised in the discussions in various departments are then collected and summarized by the factory administration, and solutions are drafted and assigned to the relevant departments for resolution.
　　Once the production plan and cost plan are determined, they become the common goal of the entire factory. At this time, factory managers must use strict systems in various daily tasks to grasp the progress of the entire production process, and use various methods to encourage workers to give full play to their enthusiasm, such as implementing excess rewards and piece-rate wages based on the seven-level wage system, rewarding rationalization proposals, and so on.
　　With the changes in production conditions (such as equipment improvement, technological improvement, etc.), the quota is not immutable and stays the same. For example, the paint factory stipulated that the daily production quota for a certain grinding machine this year is 1,350 kilograms, but due to the general improvement of workers' technology, the actual level has reached 1,800 kilograms. Therefore, the production quota for next year will also be increased accordingly. For example, the personnel quota for the paint workshop used to be set according to the production group, a total of 110 people. Since this year, due to the implementation of piece-rate wages, workers' labor efficiency has been greatly improved, and in fact only 89 people are enough now. As a result, the direct wage cost per ton of paint has been reduced by more than 130 yuan compared to before, and the income of existing workers has increased by 30 percent compared to before. Appropriate increase in the production quota is conducive to the continued development of production. Because when the majority of workers have been able to exceed the quota requirements, if the old quota is fixed and unchanged, it will not only be out of touch with the reality of production, lose its role as a guideline for formulating plans and grasping the production process, but also lose its due encouragement to workers to improve production and improve technology. This is why Dalian factories stipulate that quotas should be revised at least every six months or a year.

　　介绍大连中苏合营工厂的定额工作
　　赵棣生
    定额工作，这是建立科学的生产管理制度的重要关键之一。所谓定额，这就是说根据一定的技术水平和技术设备来确定一定产品的标准质量，确定为生产该项产品所使用原料、材料的标准数量，确定为生产该项产品所使用人员的标准数量，确定生产某种产品的标准生产时间，确定使用某种机器在一定时日产品的标准数量，确定各种经费的标准数量，确定机器的折旧等等。其中尤以前面五项更为重要。要求得这样的定额，是一件异常繁杂的工作。但是如果不求得这些定额，就不能对企业生产作科学的计算，就不能进行经济核算，而所谓减低成本，并与此相适地改善工人的生活，实行合理累进的工资制度，也就会没有确实的根据。大连的工厂，特别是大连的中苏合营工厂，在定额工作方面，现在已经有了相当的成绩。
    大连中苏合营的远东电业公司油漆工厂，解决定额的顺序是这样的：
    首先是质量定额。该厂使用原料和材料的多少和好坏以及产量的大小等，都是以一定的质量标准程度来决定的。该厂主要产品是油漆（油膏子），所用原料为油、染料、胡粉（一种石头粉）。一九四六年工厂恢复生产时，主要技术还是掌握在日本技师手中，而这些技师们的生产情绪是很低甚至是怠工的，染料的来源（过去主要靠日本）也断绝了，不能不以当地的原料（红土、白土等）来代替。当时如果仍以日本统治时期的质量作标准，很显然是办不到的。经过几次试验，当时该厂确定以日本统治时的二级品为标准，作为质量定额。但是，经过两三年来苏联技师的帮助，中国工人制造油漆的技术水平已大为提高；加以敌人的封锁已被打破，因此，今年以来该厂已能够按照苏联油漆的标准制定质量定额，使成品质量超过了日寇时代的最高水平。自然，接受一种较高级的质量标准，在少数保守的工人的思想中曾是遭到抵拒的，因为制造较高级的产品要花费更多的力量。为了动员工人生产质量较高的产品，工厂管理者曾及时地进行有效的教育说服工作。
    其次是原材料使用定额。这一环节的正确处理，对消灭物资浪费、降低成本有着极重大的作用。油漆工厂的原材料使用定额是在一定成品质量定额的基础上，根据原材料本身的质量和厂内的技术条件等因素来确定的。特别是工人技术熟练的提高，对于原材料的消耗的减少作用尤其显著。油漆工厂过去制造一百公斤油漆需用原料定额是一百零三公斤（其中胡粉占百分之五十，染料占百分之三十左右，油占百分之二十左右）；今年以来，使用原料定额已减少到一百零一公斤。按该厂每日产油漆廿五吨计算，每天原材料的使用即较前节省了五百公斤。现在实际上只用到一百零点八公斤。较定额仍减少零点二公斤。但是，原材料的节约必须是在保证质量标准的前提下始有意义。油漆工厂过去即曾有一个时候因片面追求原材料的节约，结果使产品质量降低了。
    第三是人员定额（也叫做“定员”）。油漆工厂的人员定额是根据机器效能充分发挥时的实际需要来确定；同时又根据质量的要求，配备不同技术等级的工人。油漆厂的定员是以生产小组为单元计算的，比如看管压碾机是制造油漆的重要环节，每班（八小时）需四人照管，产量约二吨需用原料数为二吨又二十公斤，于是确定搬运原料工人为二人。根据产量，装桶刷筒又需工人二人。这样，一个小组人员定额共为八人。其中一人为组长，须具有较高技术及领导小组的才能，应定为七级工人；另须有一人必要时代行组长职务，定为六级工人；其余按生产性质分别配备不同等级的工人六人。
    第四是时间定额（也叫做“定时”）。油漆工厂的定时是根据机器效能、产品种类和品质以及工人技术水平等条件计算的。例如一吨油漆需原料共为一千零十公斤，每台机器能力为每次压碾一百六十公斤左右，每次需时四十分钟。这样即算出：制造一吨油漆需时二百五十二分，也就是说制造一吨油漆的定时为四点十二分。油漆工厂在实际工作中对于定时的掌握，是通过掌握定量的检查来实现的，因为在一台压碾机每日（八小时）的生产定额一点八七吨（实际产量平均为二吨），即包含有定时的因素在内。但是，定时是否科学合理，对定量的准确程度影响甚大。所以从精确核算定时中，求得定量的进一步正确，对工厂管理者来说十分重要。
    第五是生产量定额（也叫做“定量”）。这是根据成品质量定额、机器效能、所用人工数目和他们的技术条件以及生产的难易，并参考日寇时代的平均产量等条件，经过试验后制订的。例如油漆制场有七部压碾机，因其大小不一，所以定额也不一致。一号压碾机过去每班最大效能是产一千八百公斤，平均为一千二百九十五公斤，经过试验后，确定的定额是一千二百至一千三百公斤。二号压碾机较小，则定为一千零八十公斤到一千二百公斤。又如复色油膏的制造较单色者费工，所以它的定额只定为九百公斤到一千零八十公斤。
    当各项定额确定后，工厂计划科即据此来拟制每年度的生产计划，计算出原材料的消耗数量，并根据它的价格（由企业财务部门每年统一规定，不受市场物价影响，以利成本核算）、工人工资以及其他工厂经费作出成本计划，呈请上级企业批准。然后工厂再协同工会将生产计划分配到各个制场、小组，由工人讨论如何完成并超过，变成各部门的具体计划。各部门在讨论中就提出的需要解决的问题，则经工厂行政上汇集总结，拟订解决办法，分别交由各有关部门负责解决。
    生产计划和成本计划一经确定，便成为全厂一致努力的目标。这时候工厂管理者便须要通过各种日常工作中的严密制度去掌握整个生产的进程，并用各种办法鼓励工人发挥其积极性，如实行以七级工资制为基础的超额奖励和计件工资、奖励合理化建议等等。
    随着生产条件的变化（如设备改进、技术提高等），定额也不是一成不变地墨守成规的。如油漆工厂某号压碾机今年规定每日生产定额是一千三百五十公斤，但由于工人技术的普遍性的提高，实际已达到一千八百公斤的水平。因此明年的生产定额亦将随之相应提高。又如油漆制场人员定额，过去是按生产小组来定，共为一百一十人，今年以来，由于计件工资的实行，工人的劳动效率已更大地提高，实际上现在只用八十九人便够了。结果使每吨油漆中的直接工资成本较前减少了一百三十多元，现有工人的收入则较前增加了百分之三十。生产定额的适当的提高，有利于生产的继续发展。因为当大多数工人已能超过定额要求的时候，旧的定额如固定不变，不但与生产的现实脱节，失去其对于拟制计划和掌握生产进程具有的准绳作用，而且亦将失去对于工人提高生产、改进技术应有的鼓舞作用。这就是大连各工厂为什么规定定额最少半年或一年订正一次的缘故。
