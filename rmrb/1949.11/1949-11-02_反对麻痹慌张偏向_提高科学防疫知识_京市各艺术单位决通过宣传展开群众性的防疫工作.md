Zhou You from the Propaganda Section of the Municipal Anti-Epidemic Committee reported on the work overview after the establishment of the Beijing Anti-Epidemic Committee. Subsequently, discussions were held based on the propaganda instructions issued by the Central Anti-Epidemic Committee. It was unanimously agreed that the focus of propaganda should be on opposing complacency and preventing the two deviations of panic, dispelling the masses' various concerns and superstitious ideas, enhancing the scientific knowledge of epidemic prevention for all the people, and launching mass plague prevention and control work as the principle. The content of the propaganda should focus on the characteristics and dangers of plague, epidemic prevention knowledge and methods, and experiences in preventing and controlling plague. The meeting decided that mass propaganda work would begin in Beijing next week, with a preliminary plan of half a month. It was determined that this mass propaganda work would be directly led by the Standing Committee of the Municipal Anti-Epidemic Committee. Various cultural troupes and art teams will use forms such as living newspapers, singing, slide shows, cross-talk, foreign films, and speeches to cooperate with the propaganda sections of the district offices and public security bureaus of Beijing, as well as student propaganda teams, to conduct in-depth street epidemic prevention propaganda and performances. The division of propaganda areas for each art team and cultural troupe will be uniformly discussed by the Standing Committee of the Municipal Anti-Epidemic Committee and then notified.
