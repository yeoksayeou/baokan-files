Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 18th—The Central People's Government's Government Affairs Council held its sixth meeting at 3:00 PM today. They listened to Vice Premier Chen Yun's report on commodity prices, Vice Premier Dong Biwu's report on guiding reception work, and Minister Luo Ruiqing's report on the Public Security Conference. Minister of Water Resources Fu Zuoyi and Vice Mayor of Beijing Zhang Youyu also attended, giving reports on the joint meeting of water conservancy from various liberated areas and the preparations for convening the second session of the Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference, respectively. The meeting also discussed and approved the candidates for Director of the Southwest Military and Political Committee, Chairman and Vice Chairmen of the Guizhou Provincial People's Government, and Mayor and Vice Mayors of the Chongqing Municipal People's Government, submitting them to the Central People's Government Committee for approval and appointment.
    In his report on commodity prices, Vice Premier Chen provided a detailed analysis and explanation of the reasons for the price fluctuations in various regions since the end of October, and proposed the guiding principles and specific measures for dealing with this issue.
    Premier Zhou particularly pointed out: Generally speaking, this is a difficulty in the process of victory, fundamentally different from the irreparable and devastating economic crisis under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. Specifically, the sudden surge in prices this time, in addition to speculation and sabotage and various objective reasons, should also be taken as a lesson due to the leadership's failure to properly grasp the situation in advance. In order to achieve the final victory of the Liberation War, heal the wounds of war, and restore agricultural and industrial production, the Chinese people must be prepared to accept necessary burdens and overcome unavoidable difficulties.
    Premier Zhou also gave principled instructions on how to restore production, increase revenue and reduce expenditure, and how to correctly apply financial and pricing policies. The meeting resolved to establish a special group, convened by Vice Premier Chen, to study detailed measures for dealing with this issue. Regarding the issue of guiding reception work, in order to make preparations more adequate, the originally scheduled departure date of the first group of personnel from the East China Region Working Group led by Vice Premier Dong on the 21st has been temporarily postponed.

　　政务会议听取陈副总理报告物价问题
  　周总理指示处理原则     
    决议成立专门小组研究详尽办法
    【新华社北京十八日电】中央人民政府政务院今天下午三时举行第六次政务会议，听取陈云副总理关于物价问题的报告，董副总理关于指导接收工作的报告，罗瑞卿部长关于公安会议的报告。水利部傅作义部长和北京市张友渔副市长也列席，分别作了关于各解放区水利联席会议的报告和关于筹备召开北京市第二届各界人民代表会议的报告。会议并讨论通过了西南军政委员会主任、贵州省人民政府主席、副主席以及重庆市人民政府市长、副市长的人选，提请中央人民政府委员会批准任命。
    陈副总理在关于物价问题的报告中，详细地分析和说明了十月底以来各地物价波动的原因，并且提出了处理这个问题的方针和具体办法。
    周总理特别指出：一般地说，这是胜利过程中的困难，与国民党反动统治下无可挽救的毁灭性的经济危机有着根本的区别。具体地说，这次物价的暴涨，除去投机捣乱及各种客观原因外，领导上未能事先掌握得好，也应引为教训。中国人民为了取得解放战争的最后胜利，医治战争创伤，恢复农工业生产，必须准备接受必要的担负，克服不完全可以避免的困难。
    周总理并就如何恢复生产，开源节流以及如何正确运用金融物价政策等，作了原则的指示。会议决议成立专门的小组，研究处理这个问题的详尽办法，由陈副总理召集。关于指导接收工作问题，为了使准备工作更加充分，原定二十一日由董副总理率领出发的华东区工作团第一批人员决定的行期暂延。
