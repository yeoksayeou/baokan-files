The Great October Socialist Revolution and the Flourishing of Soviet Art
    Sergei Suyodzinski, Editor-in-Chief of "Soviet Art" Newspaper
    Before the revolution, outstanding Russian art had experienced a period of stagnation and decline. Proponents of formalism and aestheticism attempted to drive art into a dead end, trying to isolate it from the vibrant field of realistic traditions. A wave of decadence and moral depravity threatened to stifle all vital and progressive art.
    The hurricane of revolution swept across Russia like an all-conquering storm. Art was revived! It shone again with all its beautiful colors. The Great October Revolution saved Russian art, liberated the creative abilities of artists and sculptors, and led them onto the path of serving the people, serving the great and lofty ideals of reason and justice, and the ideas of socialism. The famous theater worker Danchenko, expressing the thoughts and feelings of the best figures in the Russian art world, wrote: "We now all thoroughly realize that without the Great October Socialist Revolution, our art would have perished and died. The October Revolution fundamentally changed our working conditions. It liberated us from economic dependence and from the control of bourgeois shareholders. It opened up a real path for us to reach the people. At first, we ourselves did not foresee how the enormous scale of the revolution would develop."
    The large-scale revolution in the cultural and artistic fields did indeed develop unprecedentedly.
    On August 26, 1919, the great Lenin signed the historically significant decree "On the Unification of Theatrical Work." According to this decree, the Soviet state had the responsibility to make every effort to care for the further development of theatrical art work.
    The Eighth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) was an important milestone in the history of Soviet art. The Party Program adopted at this congress stipulated that it was necessary to "open up all the artistic treasures accumulated on the basis of the labor of the exploited laborers and previously completely controlled by the exploiting classes, and make them understandable to the laborers."
    The Communist Party and the Soviet government stipulated that they had the responsibility to ensure the outstanding theatrical, musical, and other artistic groups that had been working before the revolution and to create all conditions so that they could continue to engage in fruitful activities. At the same time, they also began to organize new groups that could, on the basis of the creative development of the realistic traditions of Russian art, compile art programs that meet the needs of the new audiences and listeners of theaters, concert halls, and art exhibitions.
    The vast majority of artists, musicians, and painters supported the program adopted by the Soviet government and the Communist Party regarding the further development of art, and greatly cherished the Soviet regime's concern for artistic intellectuals. The first-rate dramatic works depicting revolutionary themes, the first-rate musical works, paintings, and sculptures drawing inspiration from Soviet reality, prove this. These are not yet the most complete works, but they illustrate the efforts of Soviet artists, who for the first time truly felt the possibility of free creation, to dedicate their talents to serving the people.
    The new person—the active and conscious builder of socialism—has become the protagonist in literary and artistic creation. The artistic works of Feigin, Isakovsky, Kolos, Kornechuk, Tikhonov, Simonov, Poren, Babayevsky, Asayev, Safronov, Virta, Suviev, etc., demonstrate the excellent qualities possessed by the people in socialist countries. Their protagonists see the meaning and joy of life in self-sacrificing labor; all their actions are directed by the desire to be more beneficial to the motherland and more beneficial to the people.
    Lofty ideals and goals, close ties with life, and realistic depiction of reality—this is the fundamental characteristic of the outstanding creations of Soviet playwrights, directors, and actors.
    New people, people of the socialist country, have become the protagonists in Soviet painting and sculpture.
    Many Soviet artists, in their creations, depict the image of Stalin, in whom the Soviet people see the embodiment of their excellent ideals. The artist Shurbin, in his painting "The Morning of Our Motherland," depicts Stalin against the background of the boundless fields of the Soviet motherland, portraying the post-war recovery and development of the socialist country. Soviet painters Yakovlev, Lesednikov, and Zhukov, in their paintings, praise the peaceful life of the Soviet people and their joyful creative labor.
    Soviet composers, in their works, also praise the joyful and happy life of the Soviet people. Those musical sets, which are very rich in diversity in terms of musical style or the composer's creative personality, possess the characteristics of these general principles: democracy, clear melodies, a deep connection with the people's musical literacy, and creative absorption of the excellent traditions of previous class music.
    The art front has expanded unprecedentedly in the Soviet Union. If in the era of the Tsarist system, the largest cities in Russia were the only art centers (these cities had one hundred and fifty-three theaters), then, with the establishment of the Soviet regime, various forms of art began to rise rapidly in those regions that were previously considered the outer frontiers of the empire. Outstanding figures of Russian art, in their visits, gave fraternal and creative help to the youth art of Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, and other Soviet republics. These dozens of nations, large and small, only had the opportunity to establish their own theaters, train their own musicians, painters, sculptors, and architects after the October Revolution. Now there are seven hundred theaters in the Soviet Union, most of which are in the national republics. For example, Kazakhstan has forty-seven theaters, not including four musical groups and sixteen musical performance groups, which have four thousand theatrical and musical artists. Buryat-Mongolia has three theaters and musical groups, Moldavia has five theaters, and so on. It has become commonplace in the Soviet Union to stage the immortal masterpieces of Ostrovsky and Shakespeare on the stages of Moldavian or Tatar national theaters. For example, the Tajik Opera and Ballet Theater performs the national opera and ballet "Feli and Mejinan." Russian artists perform the songs of Azerbaijani and Ukrainian composers on the stage of the Moscow Concert Hall. Artists from the Central Asian republics and the Baltic coast perform their works in the best theaters in the Soviet capital. This is one of the remarkable achievements of the Great October Socialist Revolution, which produced the new art of the Soviet Union—art that is national in form and socialist in content.
    The huge scale of people's artistic creation is also a new phenomenon in Soviet art. The 95,000 amateur drama, opera, dance troupes, and art studios attached to various factories have 1.5 million workers, staff, and their families. The scale of amateur art activities in collective farms and troops is no less than this. Thousands of outstanding artists have emerged from amateur groups to engage in professional artistic work.
    Soviet cinema is famous abroad. Millions of people admire Soviet films, which are full of lofty ideas and characterized by artistic perfection in sets and acting. The following films in recent years have been praised by the entire people: "Meeting on the Elbe," which exposes the instigators of new wars; "Michurin" and "Academician Pavlov," which depict the great Soviet patriotic scientists; "Far Away Bride," which praises the friendship between Soviet nationalities; "A Story of a Real Man" and "The Young Guards," which depict the great spiritual strength, steadfastness, courage, and love for the motherland of the Soviet people. The victory of Soviet films at international festivals is sufficient to prove the sublime achievements of Soviet films, which definitively win most of the top prizes at international festivals.
    The Soviet film industry is a product of the Great October Revolution, and it has emerged, grown, and flourished under the conditions of the Soviet system. Tens of thousands of fixed and mobile film projection teams show films to millions of Soviet viewers in remote corners of the country. In the collective farms of Azerbaijan alone, there are 300 film projection teams working, and in Moldavia, there are 400 film projection teams working. The number of cinemas in Kazakhstan is as high as 1,150. The very well-equipped art film projection院 in Almaty, the capital of the Kazakh Republic, not only shows films that are appreciated by the Kazakh audience, but also shows films that are appreciated by the entire Soviet audience.
    Throughout the thirty-plus years of Soviet history, Soviet art has been developing steadily along the path of realism, lofty ideals, and artistic perfection. The Soviet people, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks), and the Soviet government pay close attention to the work of artists, helping them to create works dedicated to the great Stalin era. All the instructions of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) on art issues, especially the recent resolutions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on literature, drama, film, and music, are for one purpose—to build a rich treasure house of the spiritual culture of the Soviet state, and to cultivate the Soviet people in the best examples of advanced art with lofty ideals and lofty artistic value. The method of socialist realism is the basic method of Soviet art, which allows Soviet artists to truly express the life in revolutionary development, to depict the future life in their works, and to show the excellent character and qualities of the new Soviet people.
    Soviet artists have created works that are constantly being highly praised and warmly loved by the people. The annual awarding of Stalin Prizes to workers in Soviet drama, film, music, and fine arts is a striking indication of the Soviet government and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)'s concern for the development of Soviet artistic creativity, and is a proof of the Soviet state's attention and care for artistic intellectuals. For example, 309 Soviet drama workers have already won the glorious title of Stalin Prize winner, 28 drama groups have won the Order of Lenin and the Order of the Red Banner of Labor, and 75 directors have won the title of People's Artist of the Soviet Union.
    The October Revolution opened up unlimited prospects for the further development of art, and it created all the conditions for art to rise and move towards perfection. That is why all Soviet artists repeat this meaningful sentence of one of the most famous drama workers of the Soviet Union, Danchenko:
    "For us, the greatest reward we have received is the recognition that the greatest revolutionary leader is leading our work, and his name encourages our creative research and creative courage. This is the name of the great and wise Stalin, our thoughts and hearts yearn for him."

### 伟大的十月社会主义革命和苏联艺术的繁荣

　　伟大的十月社会主义革命和苏联艺术的繁荣
    “苏联艺术”报主编  谢尔吉伊·苏约德斯基
    革命以前，卓越的俄罗斯艺术曾经有过一个停顿和衰颓的时期。形式主义和唯美主义的拥护者企图把艺术驱入绝路，企图使艺术隔离于生气勃勃的现实主义传统的园地。颓废和道德堕落的波浪，曾经威胁着要扼杀一切富有生气和进步的艺术。
    革命的飓风，象吹倒一切的暴风雨似地掠过俄国。艺术复活了！它重新以它一切美妙的色彩放出了光芒。伟大的十月挽救了俄罗斯艺术，解放了艺术家和美术家的创造能力，把他们引上了为人民服务，为伟大的崇高的理性和正义思想和社会主义思想服务的大道。著名的戏剧工作者丹钦科在表达俄罗斯艺术界最优秀人物的思想和感情时写过：“我们现在都很透澈地认识到，如果没有伟大的十月社会主义革命，我们的艺术就会泯灭和死亡。十月革命根本地改变了我们的工作条件。它将我们从经济依赖中，从资产阶级股东控制之下解放出来。它为我们开辟了走向人民的真正的道路。在起先，我们自己没有预见到革命的巨大规模是如何发展的”。
    大规模的文化和艺术领域的革命，确实空前大地发展了。
    一九一九年八月二十六日，伟大的列宁签署了有历史意义的“关于戏剧工作的统一”的法令。依照这个法令，苏维埃国家有责任尽力关心戏剧艺术工作的进一步发展。
    联共（布）党第八次代表大会是苏联艺术史上的重要里程碑。在这次代表大会上所通过的党纲里，规定了必须“开放一切在剥削劳动者的劳动的基础上累积起来的和以前一直完全受剥削阶级支配的艺术宝藏，并使它们为劳动者所能理解”。
    共产党和苏联政府规定自己有责任保障在革命以前就从事工作的优秀的戏剧、音乐及其他艺术团体、并创设一切条件，使它们能继续从事有成果的活动。同时还着手组织新的团体，它们是能够在俄罗斯艺术的现实主义传统之创造性发展的基础之上，编制符合于剧院、音乐厅和艺术品展览会的新的观众和听众的需要之艺术节目。
    绝大多数的艺术家、音乐家和画家，都拥护苏联政府和共产党所采取的关于进一步发展艺术的纲领，并且非常珍重苏维埃政权对艺术知识分子的关心。描写革命题材的第一等戏剧作品，在苏维埃的现实中吸取灵感的第一等音乐作品、绘画和雕刻作品，就证明了这一点。这些还不是最完全的作品，说明了第一次真正感觉到自由创造的可能性的苏联艺术工作者，努力献出自己的才艺来为人民服务。
    新的人物——社会主义之积极与自觉的建设者，已经成为文学和艺术创作里的主人翁。费金、伊萨科夫斯基、科洛斯、科尔涅楚克、吉洪诺夫、西蒙诺夫、波仁、巴巴耶夫斯基、阿萨耶夫、萨夫罗诺夫、维尔达、苏维夫等的艺术作品，证明了社会主义国家里的人们所具有的优秀品质。他们的主人翁看见在自我牺牲的劳动中的生活的意义和愉快；他们的一切行动，是以怎样更能有益于祖国、更有益于人民这个愿望为方向的。
    崇高的理想和目标，与生活密切联系，对现实之现实主义描写——苏联作剧家、导演和演员的杰出创作的基本特色，就是如此。
    新人，社会主义国家的人，已经成为苏联绘画和雕刻创作里的主人翁。
    苏联许多美术家在他们的创作里，表现出斯大林的形象，苏联人民在这些创作里看见了他们优秀理想的体现者。美术家舒尔宾在“我们祖国的早晨”的图画里，描画斯大林于苏联祖国的一些无垠的原野的背景中，它描写社会主义国家的战后恢复和发展。苏联画家雅库夫列夫、列谢德尼科夫和朱科夫在画面上颂扬着苏联人民的和平生活以及他们的愉快的创造性劳动。
    苏联作曲家在他们的作品中，也颂扬苏联人民的愉快的幸福生活。不论在乐曲的风格上或作曲者的创造性个性上来讲，都具有非常丰富的多样性的那些乐曲集，具备着这些一般的原则的特色：民主性，明朗的乐调，与人民的音乐素养深刻联系，创造性地吸取以前的阶级音乐的优良传统。
    艺术阵线在苏联是空前无比地扩大了。如果说在沙皇制度时代俄罗斯最大的几个城市是仅有的艺术中心（这些城市里有一百五十三个剧院），那么，伴随着苏维埃政权的建立，就是在以前被认为是帝国圈外边疆的那些地区里，也开始迅速高涨着各种各式的艺术。俄罗斯艺术的杰出人物，在他们的访问中对乌兹贝克、吉尔吉斯、土克曼、哈萨克、塔吉克及其他苏联的共和国的青年的艺术，给以兄弟之谊的创造性的帮助。这些大小不等的数十个民族，只有在十月革命之后才有可能设立自己的剧院，培养自己的音乐家、画家、雕刻家和建筑家。现在苏联有七百个剧院，其中一大部分是在民族共和国里。举例来讲，哈萨克有四十七个剧院，其中还没有计入四个音乐团和十六个音乐演奏团，它们拥有四千位戏剧和音乐艺术工作者。布里亚蒙古有三个剧院和音乐团，莫达维亚有五个剧院等等。在莫达维或鞑靼民族剧院舞台上，演出奥斯德罗夫斯基和沙士比亚的不朽杰作，已经在苏联成为习见的事情。譬如在塔吉克歌剧歌舞剧院，演出民族歌舞剧“斐里和美吉南”。俄罗斯艺术家在莫斯科音乐厅的表演台上，演奏阿塞尔拜疆和乌克兰作曲家的歌曲。中亚细亚诸共和国和波罗的海沿岸的艺术家，在苏联首都最好的剧院表演他们的作品。这就是伟大的十月社会主义革命的显著成就之一，它产生了苏联的新的艺术——在形式上是民族的而在内容上是社会主义的艺术。
    人民艺术创造的巨大规模也是苏联艺术中的新现象。各工厂所附设的九万五千个业余戏剧、歌剧、歌舞团和艺术研究室里，拥有一百五十万工人、职员及其眷属。集体农场和部队里业余艺术活动的规模的巨大，也不亚于此。数以千计的杰出的艺术家，从业余集团里出来，从事职业性的艺术工作。
    苏联的电影是驰名国外的。数以百万计的人们钦羡地看着苏联的电影，它充满崇高的思想，并以配景和演技上的艺术的完美为特色。近年来的下述的电影获得全体人民的赞美：“在易北河相见”，它揭露新战争的挑拨者；“米邱林”和“科学院院士巴夫洛夫”，它们描写伟大的苏联爱国科学家；“远方未婚妻”，它赞扬苏联民族间的情谊；“一个真实人的故事”和“青年近卫军”，它们描写苏联人民的伟大的精神力量、坚定、勇敢和对祖国的热爱。苏联影片在国际节的胜利，就足以确凿地证明苏联电影的崇高成就，苏联影片在国际节确定地赢得大多数的头等奖。
    苏联电影业是伟大的十月革命的产儿，它在苏维埃制度的条件之下产生、成长和结实起来。数以万计的固定的和流动的电影放映队，在国家的遥远的角落向数以百万计的苏联观众放映电影。仅仅在阿塞尔拜疆的集体农场上，就有三百个电影放映队在工作，在莫达维亚，则有四百个电影放映队在工作。哈萨克的电影院的数目，多到一千一百五十个。哈萨克共和国首都阿拉木图的设备非常完善的艺术片放映院，不仅放映为哈萨克观众所赞赏的电影，并且还放映为全苏联观众所赞赏的电影。
    在整个苏联三十多年的历史期间内，苏联艺术一直是在坚定地沿着现实主义、崇高的理想和艺术完美的道路上发展。苏联人民、联共（布）党和苏联政府注意地关心着艺术家的工作，帮助他们创作献给伟大的斯大林时代的作品。联共（布）党关于艺术问题的一切指示，特别是最近苏联共产党中央委员会关于文学、戏剧、电影和音乐的决议，都是为了一个目的——建立苏维埃国家的精神文化的丰富宝库，在先进的具有崇高理想和崇高艺术价值的艺术的最优秀典型中培养苏联人民。社会主义的现实主义方法，是苏联艺术的基本方法，这种方法许可苏联艺术家真实地表现出革命发展中的生活，在他们的作品中描绘出未来的生活，显示出新的苏联人民的优秀性格和品质。
    苏联艺术工作者创造了日新又日新的获得人民高度评价和热烈爱好的作品。每年一度地对苏联戏剧、电影、音乐和造形艺术工作者，颁发斯大林奖金，这就是苏联政府和联共（布）党关心苏联艺术创造力发展的显著表明，就是苏联国家注意和关心艺术知识分子的证明。譬如说，已经有三百零九位苏联戏剧工作者荣膺斯大林奖金获奖人的光荣称号，二十八个剧团荣获列宁勋章和劳动红旗勋章，七十五位导演荣获苏联人民艺术家的称号。
    十月革命为艺术开辟了进一步发展的无限前景，它创设了艺术高涨和趋于完美的一切条件。这就是为什么苏联一切艺术工作者都重复讲到苏联最著名戏剧工作者之一丹钦科的意味深长的这句话：
    “对我们来说，我们所得到的奖励中的最大的奖励，就是对这一点的认识：最伟大的革命领袖正在领导着我们的工作，他的名字鼓励了我们的创造性的研究和创造性的勇气。这就是伟大英明的斯大林的名字，我们的思想和心灵都向往着他。”
