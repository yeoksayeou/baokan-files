    North China Women's Temperance Society Restoration Committee Statement
    Vow to Support Tarakani and Protest Illegal Athens Verdict
    [Reported by this newspaper] The North China Women's Temperance Society Restoration Committee recently issued a statement protesting the Greek reactionary government's illegal death sentence against Greek revolutionary women's leader Katrin Tarakani. The original text is as follows:
    We, the North China Women's Temperance Society, have learned with deep indignation of the Greek reactionary government's death sentence against Katrin Tarakani, the leader of Greek revolutionary women, and we solemnly protest this brutal and shameful verdict.
    The Greek royalist fascists, fostered by American imperialism, are constantly massacring patriotic people and persecuting leaders of the people's revolution, subjecting political prisoners to horrifying tortures. These bloody facts have fully exposed the hideous faces of the reactionary rulers and ignited the flames of anger in the hearts of people all over the world!
    Katrin Tarakani is the leader of the Greek Democratic Women's Federation, a heroic fighter against Hitler's war of aggression, and an outstanding leader in the Greek People's Liberation Movement. We call on the United Nations General Assembly to stand on a just position, accept Vyshinsky's proposal, and save Greek patriots, save Tarakani.
    At the same time, we must seriously warn the Greek reactionary government that it must immediately cancel this arbitrary and illegal verdict. The forces of peace and democracy in the world are growing stronger day by day, and any conspiracy of the reactionary rulers will eventually be shattered by the power of the people!
    The path pointed out by Tarakani is the path of women who love peace all over the world. We will therefore be more awakened and united! We vow to be Tarakani's support!
    We extend our most sincere respect to dear Tarakani!
            North China Women's Temperance Society Restoration Committee

    华北妇女节制会复员委会声明
    誓作塔拉甘尼后援抗议雅典非法判决
    【本报讯】华北妇女节制会复员委员会顷发表声明，抗议希腊反动政府非法判决希腊革命妇女领袖塔拉甘尼死刑，原文如下：
    我们华北妇女节制会获悉希腊反动政府将希腊革命妇女领袖卡特琳·塔拉甘尼判决死刑，感到深切的愤恨，我们严正地抗议这一残暴可耻的判决。
    在美帝国主义豢养之下的希腊保皇法西斯分子不断地残杀爱国人民，迫害人民革命领袖，对政治犯施行骇人听闻的酷刑，这些血腥的事实，已经充分暴露了反动统治者狰狞的面目，燃起了全世界人民愤怒的火焰！
    卡特琳·塔拉甘尼是希腊民主妇联的领导者，是反对希特勒侵略战争中英勇的战士，是希腊人民解放运动中卓越的领袖，我们呼吁联合国大会必须站在公正的立场，接受维辛斯基的建议，拯救希腊爱国者，拯救塔拉甘尼。
    同时我们要严重地警告希腊反动政府，必须立刻取消这专横非法的判决，全世界和平民主的力量正在一天天壮大起来，任何反动统治者的阴谋，终将被人民的力量粉碎的！
    塔拉甘尼所指引的道路便是我们全世界爱好和平的妇女的道路，我们将因此更加惊醒和团结起来！我们誓作塔拉甘尼的后援！
    谨向亲爱的塔拉甘尼致最崇高的敬礼！
            华北妇女节制会复员委员会启
                十一月十日
