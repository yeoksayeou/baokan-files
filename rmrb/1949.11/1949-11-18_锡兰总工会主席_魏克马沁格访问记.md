A Visit with Wickremasinghe, Chairman of the Ceylon Federation of Trade Unions
　　Zhang Jiachi

　　On November 6th, I interviewed Wickremasinghe, the Ceylon representative attending the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference. Wickremasinghe is the Chairman of the Ceylon Federation of Trade Unions and also a member of the Executive Committee of the World Federation of Trade Unions. After being introduced by a comrade from the guest house, Wickremasinghe warmly invited me to his room to talk.

　　He said that Ceylon is an agricultural country with little industry. Its agriculture is mostly commercial, with 70 percent of its grain needing to be imported from abroad. The land area is 25,000 square miles, with a population of 6.5 million. It was formerly a British colony. Although Britain declared Ceylon's autonomy after the war, foreign capitalists still controlled 80 percent of the country's economy in reality. For example, tea, which accounts for two-thirds of the total exports, has 85 percent of its production controlled by the British. Rubber, another major product, is 60 percent controlled by the British. The largest monopoly enterprise in the country, the "Stone Black Company," was also bought by British capitalists after the war. Other enterprises such as international trade, insurance, and engineering are 100 percent controlled by foreign capitalists, of which 80 percent are British, 10 percent are from other capitalist countries in Europe, and the remaining 10 percent are Indian capitalists.

　　Before World War II, although Ceylon was a country with a trade surplus, most of the surplus was plundered by foreign capitalists, and the Ceylonese working people lived in poverty. After the war, foreign capital was controlled by Wall Street in the United States, and American goods poured in. At the same time, the United States had synthetic rubber, and the price of Ceylonese rubber was greatly reduced. As a result, foreign trade was completely opposite to the situation before the war, forming a serious trade deficit, which made the lives of the people in the country even more impoverished. Under these circumstances, Ceylon's comprador capitalists prohibited the sale of rubber to the Soviet Union and sold cheap rubber to the United States. Therefore, rubber plantation owners adopted methods to intensify the exploitation of workers to maintain their profits. The Ceylon government also actively helped landlords and capitalists exploit workers. A few months ago, it passed a reactionary decree: any Indian expatriate worker—about one million—working on farms who does not obey the capitalists can be deprived of their residency rights and even deported. Wickremasinghe said: "These Indian expatriates are like the overseas Chinese in the Malay Peninsula and other parts of Southeast Asia. They have lived in Ceylon for a long time and have no property in their home country. Once they are expelled, they have nowhere to go."

　　Under the dual oppression of domestic and foreign reactionaries, the living standards of the Ceylonese working people are declining. According to a government survey in 1946, a family of five must earn 5.58 rupees a day to maintain a minimum standard of living; however, 70 percent of families of five earn less than two rupees a day, and less than 2 percent of families can earn six rupees a day. Workers on tea plantations earn an average of only 1.25 rupees a day (including all allowances), and female workers earn only 1.15 rupees. This daily income is only enough to buy 1.5 kilograms of bread or 3/8 of a pound of milk. The wages of workers on rubber plantations are even lower.

　　Because the labor of agricultural workers is not complex, capitalists specialize in employing tribal people with low cultural and living standards to work, and allow them to remain in a primitive state of life for a long time in order to rule and exploit them. Therefore, there is no talk of enjoying culture and welfare among the workers, nor of sanitation facilities and labor insurance. Female workers must work 150 days each year to be eligible for three weeks of leave, while male workers must work 230 days each year to be eligible for twelve days of leave. In fact, because there are many rainy days and many unemployed people, few people can work that many days in a year, so few people can get leave.

　　In order to facilitate its rule and help landlords and capitalists exploit workers, the Ceylon government has used various methods to prevent Ceylonese workers from organizing. It uses laws to strictly limit workers from joining trade unions, stipulating that trade unions must be strictly reviewed and supervised by government departments, and prohibiting workers in government enterprises such as postal, telecommunications, and railways from joining trade unions, requiring them to participate in organizations led by the heads of those agencies. At the same time, union cadres are not allowed to go to tea and rubber plantations casually.

　　However, no matter how strict the restrictions, the Ceylonese working class has still organized its own powerful federation of trade unions. Under the organization and education of the Ceylon Federation of Trade Unions, the Ceylonese workers have gradually become aware and are constantly fighting for their own interests: In 1947, the employees of government enterprises in the capital Colombo went on strike for a month. Two months ago, 300,000 workers, under the leadership of the federation of trade unions, went on strike for a day to protest against reactionary legislation and demand higher wages. In each strike action, the government often sends police to surround the farms and suppress them with arms. Many workers' leaders are therefore fired or arrested by capitalists, but the consciousness of the Ceylonese working class is gradually increasing.

　　I asked Wickremasinghe for his opinion on how to enhance the friendship and connection between the Chinese and Ceylonese people. He said: "The Ceylonese people hope to see photos, diagrams, etc. about the heroic deeds of the Chinese people in the struggle against American imperialism and its agent, the Kuomintang reactionaries, as well as the various achievements of the People's Republic of China, and hope that China can send cultural envoys to Ceylon."

　　At the farewell, Wickremasinghe excitedly told the reporter: The heroic struggle and victory of the Chinese people greatly encouraged the Ceylonese people. He said that recently there is a popular slogan in the anti-imperialist democratic movement of Ceylonese workers:

　　"Today is China,
　　Tomorrow will be Ceylon!" (with picture)

　　锡兰总工会主席
  　魏克马沁格访问记
    张家炽
    十一月六日，记者访问了参加亚澳工会会议的锡兰代表魏克马沁格。魏克马沁格是锡兰总工会的主席，也是世界工联执行委员会委员。经过招待所的同志介绍之后，魏克马沁格亲切地引我到他的房间里谈起来。
    他说，锡兰是一个农业国家，没有什么工业。它的农业多半是商业性质，百分之七十粮食须从国外输入。国土二万五千平方英里，人口六百五十万。她过去是英国的殖民地，战后英国虽然宣布了锡兰的自治，但实际上国家经济的百分之八十仍操纵在外国资本家手里。如占出口物品总数三分之二的茶叶，有百分之八十五的产量操纵在英国人手里。另一种大量产品橡胶，有百分之六十也操在英国人手里。全国最大的独占事业——石黑公司，在战后也被英国资本家所收买。其他如国际贸易、保险、工程等企业，更百分之百地掌握在外国资本家的手里：其中百分之八十是英国的，百分之十是欧洲其他资本主义国家的，其余的百分之十是印度资本家的。
    在二次世界大战前，锡兰虽然是一个出超的国家，但出超所得大部被外国资本家掠夺去了，锡兰劳动人民一直处在贫穷中。战后外国资本被美国华尔街所控制，美货源源涌入，同时美国有了人造橡胶，锡兰橡胶的价格大为减低，结果对外贸易与战前情况完全相反，形成严重的入超，使国内人民生活更加贫困。在这种情形下，锡兰的买办资本家反禁止出售橡胶与苏联，以廉价的橡胶卖给美国，因此橡胶农场主就采取了加紧剥削工人的方法来维持他们的利润。锡兰政府也积极帮助地主、资本家剥削，于数月前通过一条反动的法令：凡是印度侨民劳动者——约有一百万——在农场中做工不受资本家指挥，可以剥夺他们的居留权，甚至放逐出境。魏克马沁格说：“这些印度侨民正象南洋群岛马来等地的华侨一样，他们长久侨居在锡兰，在本国没有财产，一旦被驱逐就没处安身。”
    在国内外反动派的双重压榨下，锡兰劳动人民的生活水准愈来愈下降。据一九四六年政府调查：五口之家，每天必须获得五·五八个卢比的收入才能维护最低生活；但百分之七十的五口之家每天收入不到两个卢比，只有不到百分之二的家庭每天可有六个卢比的收入。茶业农场里的工人，每天平均只能得到一·二五个卢比的工资（包括一切津贴），女工只有一·一五个卢比。每天所得只够买一·五公斤的面包，或八分之三磅牛奶。橡胶农场里的工人工资则还要低。
    由于农业工人的劳动不复杂，资本家们便专门雇用一些文化及生活水平很低的部落人民来做工，并且让他们长期停留在原始的生活状态里，以便统治和剥削他们。因此在工人中谈不到享受文化与福利，也谈不到卫生设备和劳动保险。女工生育必须在每年中工作一百五十天才可以获得三个星期的假期，男工则必须每年工作二百三十天才有十二天的假期，而事实上因为下雨天多，失业人多，很少人能在一年中做那么多天活，因此也就很少有人能获得假期。
    锡兰政府为便于统治与帮助地主、资本家剥削工人，曾用种种方法阻止锡兰工人组织起来。它用法令严格限制工人加入工会，规定工会必须得到政府部门的严格审查与监督，禁止邮电铁路等政府企业的工人加入工会，必须参加以各该机关首长为领导的组织。同时也不准工会干事随便到茶叶橡胶农场中去。
    但是，不论限制如何严格，锡兰的工人阶级仍然组织了自己强大的总工会。锡兰工人在总工会的组织与教育之下，已渐渐觉悟起来，为争取自己的利益而不断进行斗争：一九四七年，首都科伦坡政府企业的职工曾罢工一月，二个月前，三十万工人在总工会领导下曾为抗议反动立法及要求提高工资罢工一天。在每次罢工行动中，政府往往派警察包围农场武装镇压，许多工人领袖因此被资本家开除或逮捕，但锡兰的工人阶级觉悟却一步步提高了。
    记者曾以如何增进中锡两国人民的友谊和联系为题，征询魏克马沁格的意见，他说：“锡兰人民希望看到有关中国人民在反对美帝国主义及其代理人国民党反动派的斗争中的英勇事迹，以及中华人民共和国的各种成绩的照片、图解等等，并希望中国能派文化使节到锡兰去”。
    在告别的时候，魏克马沁格兴奋地告诉记者：中国人民的英勇斗争和胜利，大大地鼓舞了锡兰人民。他说，最近在锡兰工人的反帝国主义民主运动中有一句流行的口号：
    “今天是中国，
    明天就是锡兰了！”（附图片）
