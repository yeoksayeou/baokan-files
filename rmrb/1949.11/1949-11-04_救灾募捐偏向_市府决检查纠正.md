Disaster Relief Donations Show Bias
　　The Municipal Government Decides to Inspect and Correct
　　[Beijing News] Since the Beijing Municipal All-Circles Disaster Relief Committee began its work, it has achieved significant results. However, recently, according to reports from various sources, some departments or working cadres have violated the principle of voluntarism during fundraising, resulting in forced donations or apportionments. Furthermore, at the charity performance held by the Peking Opera community on the evening of the 29th of last month, some unnecessary staff members watched the performance with employee cards and invitation cards, which is inconsistent with the requirements of disaster relief. Zhang Youyu, Deputy Mayor of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, raised these two issues at the government affairs meeting on the 2nd. After discussion, it was decided to send personnel to cooperate with the Disaster Relief Committee to strictly investigate the truth. If any donations were not voluntary but were forcibly apportioned, the donated money and goods will be returned, and the cadres who carried out the fundraising will be criticized. At the same time, the Municipal Personnel Department and the Administrative Office are instructed to jointly investigate. If anyone watched the charity performance for disaster relief with a pass but was not required to do so for work, they will be required to pay the ticket price and will be subject to punishment.

　　救灾募捐偏向
  　市府决检查纠正
    【北京讯】本市各界救灾委员会展开工作以来，已获有显著成绩，但近据各方反映，有些部门或工作干部在进行募捐时，曾有违反自愿原则，发生强征或摊派的现象。又在上月二十九日京剧界举行义演的晚会上，有些不必要的工作人员，凭职员证和招待证在场看戏，不合救灾的要求。北京市人民政府张友渔副市长曾于二日政务会议上将此二事提出，经讨论后，决定派员协同救灾委员会严查真象，如有捐款非出于自愿，而系被强征摊派者，除退还所捐物款外，并批评该进行募捐之干部。同时责成市府人事处、行政处共同检查，如有非工作必要而凭条看义演救灾戏者，需追补票价，并予以处分。
