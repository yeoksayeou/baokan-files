　　Representative Conferences of All Circles Have Been Held in Major Cities Such as Changsha

　　In October, major cities liberated earlier, such as Changsha, Xiangtan, Yueyang, Xiangyin, and Yiyang, successively convened representative conferences of people from all walks of life. These conferences all focused on the central tasks of production and supporting the front lines, combined with the specific conditions of each locality, and concentrated on discussing the main problems of each place. For example, Changsha is a commercial and consumer city in the inland, and the conference seriously discussed how to develop the necessary commerce and transportation industries to connect trade between urban and rural areas and promote the recovery and development of industry. The Yueyang People's Representative Conference reviewed the issue of eliminating bandits and secret agents. Xiangyin, Liuyang, and other counties discussed the difficulties in the current grain requisition work. These conferences were mostly well prepared. People from all walks of life earnestly elected appropriate representatives, and widely solicited opinions from all parties before the meeting. Therefore, the conferences closely linked the government with the people, reflected the true situation, and accurately formulated work guidelines and feasible specific plans. After the representative conferences of all circles in Changsha, Changde, and other cities, the representatives went back and widely disseminated the resolutions, making the resolutions of the conference the program of action for the people.

　　长沙等主要城市已召开各界代表会议
    十月份，较早解放的各主要城市如长沙、湘潭、岳阳、湘阴、益阳等地，已陆续召开各界人民代表会议。这些会议都围绕着生产和支援前线的中心任务，结合各地的具体情况，集中地讨论了各地当前的主要问题。如长沙市是一个内地的商业消费城市，会议便认真地讨论了如何发展必要的商业和运输业，以便沟通城乡内外贸易，促进工业的恢复和发展等问题。岳阳的各界人民代表会议则检讨了肃清土匪特务问题。湘阴、浏阳等县则针对目前征粮工作中的困难，加以商讨。这些会议多数是经过充分准备，各界人民都认真地推选了适当代表，并于会前广泛征求了各方意见，因而密切了政府与人民的联系，反映了真实情况，准确地制定了工作方针与可行的具体方案。长沙市、常德市等各界代表会议开过以后，代表们回去都进行了广泛的传达，使大会决议成为人民的行动纲领。
