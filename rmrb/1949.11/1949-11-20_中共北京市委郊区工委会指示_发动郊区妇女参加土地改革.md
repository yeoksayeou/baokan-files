　　CPC Beijing Municipal Committee Suburban Work Committee Directs
  　Mobilization of Suburban Women to Participate in Land Reform
    [Reported by this newspaper] The Suburban Work Committee of the CPC Beijing Municipal Committee issued "Instructions on Women's Work in the Land Reform in Suburban Areas" on the 17th of this month. The original text is as follows: (1) Mobilizing all farmers and peasant women to participate in the land reform movement, preparing for the great production next year, is the central task of the current women's work in suburban areas. To achieve this goal, first of all, all cadres must pay attention to educating peasant women about land reform, and clearly distinguish the class boundaries between landlords and peasants. Second, learning from the experiences and lessons of the old areas, women should be mobilized at the same time as peasants are mobilized; the mobilization of women should be carried out throughout the entire land reform process, and do not mobilize men first and women later, or start but not finish, and it is necessary to strictly prohibit the mass-detaching work style of forced orders and formalism (such as emphasizing twisting Yangko dance, changing names, etc.). Third, pay attention not to casually put "broken shoe" hats on women in the struggle to attack them and disrupt our own ranks.
    (2) In order to ensure the unity of action of the peasant class in the struggle against the landlord class, and to unite all male and female peasants into an inseparable whole, peasant women must be organized into farmers' associations, and women's organizations should not be established separately.
    The following should be noted in the organizing process: 1. Men and women in a family should not be divided into the same group, so that women and young people dare to fully express their opinions. 2. Mixed gender grouping or separate grouping of women can be used flexibly. 3. Pay attention to cultivating activists among peasant women and select them to participate in the leadership work of the farmers' associations. 4. Hold women's representative conferences in a planned and prepared manner, widely collect women's opinions, discuss important issues concerning women themselves, convey the resolutions of higher authorities, and call for their implementation, so as to closely connect the leadership with the masses.
    (3) In terms of leadership: ① Pay attention to absorbing women cadres to participate in the leadership work of the district farmers' associations, and allocate women cadres to various land reform work groups in a planned way, so that they can pay more attention to the problems and experiences in women's mobilization. ② In the work deployment, inspection, and summary of the district party committee and branch, women's work should be included to ensure the party's regular leadership over women's work, and to summarize experience and correct deviations at any time. ③ In combination with the work of building the party and the League in the entire land reform, pay attention to developing female party members and female League members to establish a leadership core among the women masses.

　　中共北京市委郊区工委会指示
  　发动郊区妇女参加土地改革
    【本报讯】中共北京市委郊区工作委员会于本月十七日，发出“关于在郊区土地改革中对妇女工作的指示”，原文如下：（一）发动全体农民农妇参加土地改革运动，准备明年大生产，为当前郊区妇女工作的中心任务。为达此目的，首先，全体干部必须注意，对农民妇女进行土改的教育，划清地主与农民的阶级界限。第二，吸收老区的经验教训，要在发动农民中同时发动妇女；把发动妇女贯澈在全部的土改过程中，不要先男后女，有始无终，并要严禁强迫命令形式主义（如强调扭秧歌，改名字等）的脱离群众作风。第三，注意在斗争中不要随便给妇女戴破鞋帽子加以打击而紊乱自己阵营。
    （二）为了保障农民阶级对地主阶级斗争中行动的统一，使全体男女农民团结成一个不可分离的整体，必须把农民妇女组织到农会里，不单独建立妇女组织。
    在组织过程中需注意：一、一家中之男女不要划在一个小组内，使妇女和青年敢于充分表达自己的意见。二、男女混合编组或妇女单独编组可灵活使用。三、注意培养农民妇女中的积极分子并选拔她们参加农会的领导工作。四、有计划有准备的召开妇女代表会议，广泛搜集妇女意见，讨论妇女本身的重大问题，传达上级决议，并号召执行，以密切领导与群众的联系。
    （三）在领导上：①注意吸收妇女干部参加区农会的领导工作，并有计划的把妇女干部分配到各个土改工作组中去，使之更多的注意妇女发动中的问题和经验。②在区委与支部的工作布置、检查和总结中，要把妇女工作包括进去，以保证党对妇女工作的经常领导，随时总结经验，纠正偏向。③结合整个土改中的建党建团工作，注意发展女党员，女团员，以建立妇女群众中的领导核心。
