　　　　　I. The Position and Future Development of Commodity Tax in China's Current Stage
    Commodity tax is a major tax in indirect taxation. The merits and demerits of direct and indirect taxes have always been debated by tax scholars, which will not be discussed here. However, it must be pointed out that taxation policy is a part of the overall fiscal and economic policy. Our fiscal and economic policy is fundamentally different from that of the former Kuomintang reactionary government and capitalist countries, so our taxation policy naturally has fundamental differences from theirs. Therefore, it is not possible to have a correct understanding if we use the eyes of old tax scholars to judge the merits and demerits of our tax system.
    Because commodity tax has all the advantages of universal burden and economic collection, it should become the main source of national tax revenue under the current economic conditions in our country. Since our economic policy is to achieve the goal of "developing production and prospering the economy" through the policy of "taking into account both public and private interests, benefiting both labor and capital, helping each other in urban and rural areas, and exchanging internally and externally," and our tax policy should be based on the principle of "ensuring the supply of the revolutionary war, taking care of the recovery and development of production, and meeting the needs of national construction," commodity tax should not only play a great role in "ensuring supply," but also, because of its extremely close relationship with production development and material exchange, it should obey the overall economic policy and closely cooperate with various economic departments to play an important role in developing production and prospering the economy.
    In the past, during the Kuomintang rule, the social economy belonged to a semi-feudal and semi-colonial nature, so their tax system also had serious colonial colors, especially the commodity tax system. Although it has had a long history of more than 20 years, it has always been bound by the interests of imperialism and the bureaucrat-capitalist class, so its colonial color is particularly strong; and our commodity tax system today needs to appear in a new posture.
    From the perspective of the future development of the New Democratic economy, commodity tax will occupy a major position for a certain period of time due to the gradual prosperity of the economy, and commodity tax will also be an important item in the national income throughout the entire process of the New Democratic society.
    　　　　II. The Spirit that Commodity Tax Should Possess
    Since our tax policy must obey the general policy of developing production and prospering the economy, our requirements for commodity tax must be closely coordinated with the general economic policy. Therefore, our commodity tax system should have the following characteristics:
    (1) Regulating and Stimulating Production
    When considering the scope of commodity tax (tax items) and the weight of the tax burden (tax rate), we must first not hinder the recovery and development of production. Although commodity tax is a transferred tax, when determining tax items and tax rates, we must consider the position of the commodity in the national economy and people's livelihood, production capacity, elasticity of supply and demand, and profit to determine the scope of taxation and appropriate tax rates. Therefore, all industrial and commercial enterprises that are beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood, currently have underdeveloped production, or have not fully recovered production, and are still in the early stages of development, should be included in the scope of tax reduction or exemption. For goods within the scope of taxable goods, heavy taxes should be levied on luxury goods, superstitious items, and non-essential goods that are restricted and banned, so as to play the role of regulating production and consumption. For daily necessities for general people's livelihood, taxes should be levied under the principle of universality and fairness. The tax burden should be effective in stimulating the production of taxable items, and should not hinder production. In this way, commodity tax can play the role of regulating and stimulating production, which is in line with the economic policy in our Common Program.
    (2) Facilitating Material Exchange and Protecting Legitimate Industry and Commerce
    Our tax work cannot be without a complete set of tax collection system. Some people think that it is good as long as it is simplified (of course, being too complicated is not right); it is not comprehensive enough. If the tax collection of commodity taxable items is too simple, smuggling and tax evasion cannot be controlled, which will not only fail to achieve the financial purpose of "ensuring supply," but, most importantly, legitimate industrial and commercial enterprises that pay taxes legally will not be protected, and the role of regulating and stimulating production will not be fulfilled. Therefore, our tax system must take into account the two principles of strictness and convenience, and "simplify the tax system" as much as possible, so as to conform to the policy of "helping each other in urban and rural areas and exchanging internally and externally."
    (3) Protecting the Development of Domestic Industry
    In terms of supporting industrial development, in addition to stimulating legitimate industrial and commercial enterprises that are beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood to produce and facilitating material exchange, in order to prevent foreign imported goods from hitting domestic industries, it is more necessary to implement a protection policy. This issue is mainly reflected in tariffs, but commodity tax must also take this into account. Therefore, in addition to levying different tariffs on imported goods depending on whether they are beneficial to our economy, if they are goods within the scope of commodity tax, they should also bear commodity tax, so as not to affect the sales of the same domestic goods due to tax burden. For export goods, it should also be determined according to whether the export of the goods is beneficial to our economy and its position in the foreign market. Those who encourage exports should not only be exempt from tariffs, but also be refunded their commodity tax (according to tax experts, commodity tax should not be refunded for exports), so that our export goods can compete for the market abroad. According to the policy of "encouraging exports and restricting imports," flexibly use it to achieve the task of using tax policy to protect the development of domestic industry.
    (4) Balancing the Tax Burden
    We adopt different tax rates for various goods, which is in line with the consumer's ability to bear. For example, heavy taxes are levied on luxury goods and consumables, and light taxes are levied on daily necessities for people's livelihood, so that the tax burden tends to be balanced and reasonable. At the same time, when we observe from a large perspective, we must also balance various taxes. The distribution of tax burden figures for agricultural tax, industrial and commercial tax, commodity tax, and tariffs must be fair and reasonable, so as not to affect the normal development of the social economy due to excessive or insufficient burden. This is the correct policy of "implementing a reasonable burden."
    　　　　III. The Drafting Process of the Provisional Regulations on Commodity Tax in the North China Region
    The North China People's Government officially promulgated the Provisional Regulations on Commodity Tax in the North China Region on September 21. Although this tax law has only sixteen articles, it has undergone a long period of preparation in the drafting process. As early as before the liberation of Beijing and Tianjin, the initial drafts of various tax laws had been drafted. After many studies and revisions, the opinions of the representatives of tax work in various regions of North China were heard at the Second North China Tax Conference in May this year, and practical work experience was absorbed; at the same time, relevant departments, representatives of the industrial and commercial circles, democratic figures, scholars, and experts were repeatedly invited in Beijing and Tianjin to hold several symposiums to revise the original draft. When determining the tax items and tax rates, in order to be more in line with the actual situation, the Ministry of Finance and the General Taxation Bureau of the North China People's Government carefully sent a large number of cadres to various places to conduct on-the-spot investigations of the specific business conditions of industry, commerce, fisheries, and mining, and obtained a lot of real materials, proving that various industries in Beijing, in addition to transferring the tax burden, still have considerable profits. For example, the net profit of the match industry is 20%, the cigarette industry is 10%, the foreign wine industry is 30%, and the beer industry is about 40%.
    Other places such as Tianjin, Tangshan, Zhangjiakou, and Shijiazhuang have also undergone specialized investigations to obtain a certain real profit rate for various industries. Based on the above investigation materials, the tax items and tax rates were initially determined. Finally, the tax items and tax rates were submitted to the Shanghai Conference for consultation and revision with various liberated areas across the country. After a unanimous decision was reached across the country, the "Provisional Regulations on Commodity Tax in the North China Region" was promulgated. From here, we can see the responsible spirit of our People's Government.
    Regarding the various procedural laws that cooperate with the regulations, such as the detailed rules for tax collection, evaluation rules, rules for resident factory staff, handling methods for illegal cases, inspection and anti-smuggling methods, methods for customs to collect commodity tax on behalf of the government, and provisions for the handling of confiscated goods, the North China Tax Bureau has been drafting them while drafting the regulations. With the multiple improvements of the regulations, they have been revised one by one, and now they have all been completed.
    Although the regulations and procedural laws promulgated this time have undergone a long period of research and revision as mentioned above, if we demand perfection of commodity tax, there may still be many shortcomings and fail to achieve the expected results. It remains to be put into practice and tested in work, and it remains to be enriched and improved in work.
    　　　　IV. The Central Issues in the Provisional Regulations on Commodity Tax in the North China Region
    Although the Provisional Regulations on Commodity Tax in the North China Region have been promulgated, we must constantly study and prepare for improvement. Therefore, whether we conduct further research in theory or summarize its advantages and disadvantages in actual work tests, we must grasp the central issues in the regulations in order to find the focus of improvement and provide reference for unifying the national tax policy. I think there are the following four central issues in the regulations:
    (1) Tax Items and Tax Rate Issues
    The specific content of taxation is the tax items and tax rates, which are of course the most important issues. Although the tax items and tax rates promulgated this time have undergone a long period of careful consideration and a unanimous decision across the country, it remains to be studied and improved whether there are still shortcomings in them. I think it can be investigated from three aspects:
    (1) Study each taxable commodity's tax items and tax rates themselves.
    For each taxable commodity, we should understand its production process, sales situation, cost, and profit in detail, whether the tax can be fully transferred, and which class bears the tax transfer. By mastering the above situations, it can be proved whether the various taxable commodities we have decided are reasonable and whether the tax rate is appropriate.
    (2) Study the interrelationships of various taxable commodities and the interrelationships with other commodities.
    Among various taxable goods, some goods have a close relationship with other goods, or this type of goods is a major raw material for another, or their properties are similar and can be substituted for each other in consumption. Therefore, we must not only study each tax item individually, but also investigate and study the tax's should-be-levied or not-levied and the tax burden's heaviness in their interrelationships.
    (3) Study from the special circumstances of each region.
    Although the tax items and tax rates currently promulgated have been jointly discussed and unanimously decided by various liberated areas across the country at the Shanghai Conference, due to China's vast area and the rapid development of the victorious situation, the number of newly liberated areas is increasing day by day. Therefore, whether the tax items and tax rates stipulated this time can be suitable for various regions remains to be further studied, tested, and improved. This is also the preparation work that should be done to unify the national tax policy.
    (2) Evaluation Method Issues
    Since commodity tax is levied ad valorem, in addition to the issue of tax items and tax rates, whether the assessment of tax prices is fair and reasonable is the most important issue. Moreover, when assessing dutiable prices, we must not only take into account the fairness of the burden, but also grasp the principle of never allowing taxes to stimulate price increases. Especially when the sales of taxable goods are stagnant and affect the production situation, in order to take care of the development of production, we would rather have less revenue in finance than let the tax burden affect the development of production. For example, since April this year, the tax amount of cigarette products has been levied at 70% of the tax amount and the tobacco leaf tax has been abolished. This is a temporary measure to take care of the poor sales of the Beijing-Tianjin cigarette industry. In order to take care of production, since March this year, the wholesale price adopted when assessing tax prices and tax amounts each month has been lower than the actual market wholesale price. For example, the wholesale price adopted for iron in mineral products in May only reached 39% of the actual market wholesale price. The wholesale prices adopted for matches, cement, and cotton yarn in May and June did not reach 50% of the actual market wholesale price. Therefore, there has been no tendency for taxes to stimulate price increases from the beginning.
    This basic spirit will of course continue to be implemented in the future. Looking at the evaluation calculation formula contained in Article 5 of the regulations, there are the following three prominent features. (1) The average wholesale price is based on the average wholesale price of the local market from the 25th of last month to the 24th of this month. Therefore, the phenomenon of the assessed tax price not being fair and reasonable will never be caused by the occasional rise and fall of the market price. (2) In order not to levy taxes on taxes, the calculation formula of dividing the average wholesale price by one plus the tax rate is adopted to deduct the taxes paid. In this way, it will not stimulate prices. (3) When the price rises and falls by more than 25%, the dutiable price must be adjusted at any time. It is by no means a follow-up method of rising taxes when the price rises today, but it is adjusted when it rises and falls by about a quarter to prevent the stimulating effect from occurring when the price fluctuates.
    Although our evaluation calculation formula is based on past implementation experience and is considered to be more appropriate, there are still different methods among various liberated areas across the country. In order to prepare for the unification of the national tax system, we must further study. (1) Whether it is appropriate to base it on the market average wholesale price of one month. (2) In addition to deducting the tax amount from the average wholesale price, whether it is appropriate to deduct the profit and freight. (3) When the market price rises and falls by more than a quarter, the tax price is adjusted. Whether the quarter ratio number is appropriate should be studied and tested in actual implementation.
    (3) Ticket, Certificate, and Stamp Issues
    Tickets, certificates, and stamps are all vouchers for paying taxes and must take into account the two principles of strictness and convenience. In the regulations and detailed rules for tax collection promulgated this time, the provisions for tickets and certificates are based on the tax payment certificate as the main tax payment voucher. The consignment note is the differentiation function of the tax payment certificate, and the tax payment certificate and the inspection certificate are the auxiliary tax payment vouchers, which are used to prove that the scattered goods are indeed goods that have been taxed. Such a ticket and certificate system is a system in which the main tax payment voucher and the auxiliary tax payment voucher are linked to each other, on the one hand, preventing the tax payment certificate from being replaced and reused, and on the other hand, preventing the tax payment certificate from being replaced and reused. Therefore, it is a relatively strict system. The fact that the tax system must not be too strict or too simple has been discussed in the previous article. We must examine the current ticket and certificate system according to the two principles of strictness and simplicity and not hindering material exchange (the latter being the main one) in order to seek improvement.
    (4) Issues of Penalties for Violations
    Our focus on preventing smuggling and tax evasion lies in raising the awareness and understanding of the masses. Therefore, the basic spirit of handling illegal cases is to severely investigate and leniently deal with them, and education is more important than punishment. However, in order to ensure that the tax law can be smoothly implemented, there must be provisions for penalties. Article 12 of the regulations stipulates different penalties for procedural errors, tax evasion, and criminal offenses, depending on the severity. There are also more detailed provisions in the detailed rules for tax collection, but the circumstances of violations are ever-changing. Whether the provisions in the regulations and detailed rules can be included and whether the severity is appropriate must be grasped in the specific implementation, grasp the basic spirit, and test them at any time.
    　　　　V. The Understanding that Should Be Had of These Regulations and Hopes for the Future
    Now that the new tax law has been promulgated, the first thing is how to implement the tax law. All our tax workers should also take a step higher in the work of implementing commodity tax. We should re-examine our past work when this new tax law is promulgated. The advantages should be continued to be carried forward, and the shortcomings should not be allowed to continue to exist. In the implementation of the regulations, we must strictly ensure unity and adhere to unity. The first is the unity of tax items and tax rates, and the second is the unity of collection procedures, which must be implemented in accordance with the regulations. If there are any questions about the tax law, and if there are any facts that are not clearly stipulated in the tax law, you must ask for instructions in advance. For more important matters, you must report afterwards. All unorganized and undisciplined work styles should be strictly corrected. More importantly, our tax work must be permeated with the mass viewpoint. Do not hinder the development of industry and commerce due to taxation, and do not trouble or delay industrialists and merchants due to tax collection. Secondly, we must step up the study of business and deeply understand the legislative spirit of the regulations in order to give play to the correctness of the policy. We need to recognize that tax policy is a part of economic policy. It would be wrong to proceed solely from a financial point of view in tax work. Conversely, it is also wrong to proceed solely from a one-sided benevolent government point of view, which cannot give play to the effectiveness of the policy and cannot guarantee the supply of the revolutionary war. Therefore, every tax worker must deeply understand the legislative spirit of the new tax law, be proficient in business, so that in the implementation of the work, neither left nor right, lenient and strict appropriately, in order to give play to the correctness of the policy.
    The Central People's Government has been established. Under the leadership of the Central Government, the national tax policy will soon be unified, and the commodity tax system will be further improved. In the implementation of this tax law, we should closely combine it with investigation and research work, absorb practical experience, and prepare to provide reference when the Central Government unifies the national tax policy. Therefore, tax workers should take on the task of implementing and researching and improving this tax law and its detailed rules. It is also hoped that scholars, experts, democratic figures, and representatives of the industrial and commercial circles will put forward more opinions on theory and implementation for the government's reference, so that the people's tax work can be improved to a higher level.

　　华北区货物税暂行条例简介
　　李予昂
  　　　　　一、货物税在中国现阶段中的地位和前途的发展
    货物税是间接税中的主要税赋，直接税和间接税的互有长短，向为赋税学者所争论的问题，在此姑不具论。但必须指出的：就是税收政策是整个财政经济政策的一部分，我们的财政经济政策，既与以往国民党反动政府及资本主义国家有基本性质上的不同，所以我们的税收政策，自然也与它们有基本性质上的差异。因此，若用旧赋税学者的眼光，来评判我们税制的孰优孰劣，是不能有正确的认识的。
    由于货物税有负担普遍、征收经济的一切优点，所以在我国现阶段的经济条件之下，应成为国家赋税收入中的主要收入。由于我们的经济方针，是以“公私兼顾、劳资两利、城乡互助、内外交流”的政策，达到“发展生产、繁荣经济”之目的，我们的税收政策又是应以“保障革命战争的供给，照顾生产的恢复和发展及国家建设的需要”为原则，所以货物税不仅要在“保证供给”方面发生很大的作用，同时因为其本身与生产发展、物资交流有极端密切的关系，所以应该是服从总的经济政策且须和各经济工作部门密切配合，在发展生产、繁荣经济上起其重要的作用。
    过去在国民党统治时期，社会经济属于半封建半殖民地的性质，所以他们的税赋制度也带有严重的殖民地色彩，尤其货物税制度，虽已有二十余年的悠久历史，但它从来就是受帝国主义及官僚资产阶级的利益所束缚，因之其殖民地色彩尤其浓厚；而我们今天的货物税制度，则更需要以崭新的姿态出现。
    以新民主主义经济的前途发展来看，将来由于经济的逐步繁荣，货物税将在一定时期内占主要地位，而在整个新民主主义社会进程中，货物税亦将是国家收入中重要的一项。
    　　　　二、货物税应具备的精神
    我们的税收政策，既须服从发展生产繁荣经济的总方针，所以我们对货物税的要求也就必须与经济总方针密切配合，因此我们的货物税制度应当具备下列的特点：
    （一）调节与刺激生产
    在考虑货物税的课税范围（税目），及税负的轻重（税率）时，首先必须不妨碍生产的恢复和发展，因为货物税虽是转嫁税，但厘订税目税率时，必须考虑该项货物在国计民生的位置如何、生产能力如何、供求之弹性如何、利润如何来决定课税的范围及适当的税率，因此，凡属有利于国计民生工商事业，目前生产不发达，或生产尚未完全恢复，以及尚在发展初期者，均应分别列入减税或免税范围以内，而在应税货物范围以内的货物又须贯彻对奢侈品、迷信品及属于限制取缔的非必需品课以重税，以起调节生产及消费的作用，至对一般民生日用的必需品，则在普遍公允的原则下予以征税。其税负应当是对于应税物品有刺激生产的效能，而无妨碍生产的弊病，这样货物税才能起调节和刺激生产的作用，吻合我们共同纲领中的经济政策。
    （二）便利物资交流与保护正当工商业
    我们的税收工作是不能没有一套完整的稽征制度的，有人以为只要简化就好（当然过繁是不对的）；亦还不够全面，如对货物应税品之稽征失之过简，则走私漏税无法控制，不仅不能达到“保证供给”的财政目的，而最重要的是对正当合法纳税的工商业得不到保护，也就不能尽到调节和刺激生产的作用，所以我们的税收制度必须顾及严密和便利的两个原则，尽可能的“简化税制”，以符合“城乡互助内外交流”的方针。
    （三）保护本国工业的发展
    在扶助工业发展方面除刺激有利于国计民生的正当工商业者生产及便利物资交流外，为了防止国外进口货物打击本国工业起见，更需要实行保护政策。这个问题固然主要表现在关税上，而货物税方面也必须照顾到这一点，因此对进口货物除视其对我经济有利与否，征收轻重不同的关税以外，若系货物税课税范围以内的货物，应同样使其负担货物税，以免因税负的关系，影响了本国同样货品的销路。对于出口货物则亦应视该项货物的出口对我经济之是否有利，以及在国外市场上的地位而规定，奖励出口者不但免征其关税，并且退还其货物税（据税收专家谈，出口不应退货物税），使我们的出口货物能在国外争取市场，根据“奖出限入”的方针，灵活运用，以达到用税收政策保护本国工业发展的任务。
    （四）平衡税负
    我们对各种货物采取不同的税率，切合于消费者的负担能力，如奢侈品、消耗品重税，民生必需品轻税，这样就能使税负趋于平衡合理，同时我们在大的方面来观察，更须要使各种税赋达到平衡，农业税、工商税、货物税、关税的税负数字的分配，必须公平合理，以免畸轻畸重而影响社会经济的正常发展，这就是“实行合理负担”的正确方针。
    　　　　三、华北区货物税暂行条例的起草经过
    华北人民政府在九月二十一日正式公布了华北区货物税暂行条例，这部税法虽然仅仅十六条但在起草过程中，却经过了很长时期的准备工作，早在京津解放前，已着手拟定了各项税法的初稿，以后经过多次的研究修改，本年五月华北二届税务会议时，又听取华北各区税务工作代表的意见，吸取了实际工作的经验；同时在北京天津两地，迭次邀请各有关部门，工商界代表，民主人士，学者专家，开会座谈数次再将原草案加以修订。在厘订税目税率时，为了更切合实际情况起见，华府财政部与税务总局曾慎重的派出大批干部，分赴各地实地调查工商渔矿业的具体经营情况，获得不少真实材料，证明在北京各业除将税负转嫁外，尚有相当的利润，如火柴业的纯利润是２０％，纸烟业１０％，洋酒业３０％，啤酒业是４０％左右。
    其他各地如天津唐山张家口石家庄等地，亦均经过专门的调查，求得各行业一定真实的利润率，根据以上调查材料，初步决定了税目税率，最后又将税目税率提在上海会议上，与全国各解放区会商修正，得到了全国一致的决定后，才公布了这一“华北区货物税暂行条例”，从这里可以看出我们人民政府慎重负责的精神。
    关于配合条例的各种手续法，如条例的稽征细则、评价规则、驻厂员规则、违章案件处理办法、稽查缉私办法、海关代征货物税办法、没收品处理的规定等，华北税总均在起草条例同时，着手拟订，随着条例的多次改进，而一一修改，现在也都已经完成。
    此次公布的条例及手续法，虽然如上所述经过长时期的研究修改，但是若以我们对货物税求全的程度要求来看，自然还可能存在着不少的缺点，未能达到预期的成果，有待于拿到工作中去实践与考验，还有待于在工作中再加充实改进。
    　　　　四、华北区货物税暂行条例中的中心问题
    华北区货物税暂行条例虽已颁布，而我们必须经常加以研究和准备改进，所以我们无论在理论上作更进一步的研究，或者在实际工作考验中总结其优缺点，均必须抓住条例中的几个中心问题，才能找到改进的重心，同时供统一全国税政的参考。我认为条例的中心问题有下列四端：
    （一）税目税率问题
    课税的具体内容，就是税目税率，当然是最首要的问题，此次公布的税目税率，虽经过长时期的审慎考虑，及全国一致的决定，但是否内中还有缺点，仍待研究改进，我认为可以从三方面来考察：
    （１）从每种课税货物税目税率本身来研究
    我们对每种课税货物应该了解其生产过程，销售情况，成本及利润的详确情形，税款是否能全部转嫁，以及税款转嫁的归宿究属那一阶层负担。掌握了以上各种情况就可以证明，我们所决定的各项课税货物是否合理，税率的轻重是否适当。
    （２）从各种课税货物的相互关系及与其他货物的相互关系来研究
    各种应税货物中，有些货物与其他货物有着密切的关系，或者此种货物是另一种的主要原料，或者彼此的性质相近，在消费上能够互相代替，所以我们不仅要单独研究每种税目，而更要在其相互关系中，来调查研究税的应否征课及税负之轻重。
    （３）从各个地区的特殊情形来研究
    现在公布的税目税率，虽然在上海会议中经过全国各解放区的共同商讨，一致决定，但由于我国区域广阔，并由于胜利形势的迅速发展，新解放的地区日有增加，所以此次规定税目税率，究竟是否能够适合于各个地区，尚有待于进一步的研究考验再加改进，这也是统一全国税政应作的准备工作。
    （二）评价方式问题
    货物税既是从价征收，所以除了税目税率的问题以外，评定税价是否公平合理，就是最重要的问题。并且我们在评定完税价格的时候，不仅要顾及负担的公允，并且要掌握住决不使税收刺激物价上涨的原则，尤其在应税货物销路滞塞影响生产情况时，为了照顾发展生产起见，宁使财政上少收入些，也不使税负影响了生产的发展。例如自本年四月份起，卷烟类税额曾按七折征税，并取消了烟叶税，即为照顾京津卷烟工业销路不畅之临时措施。为了照顾生产，由本年三月份起，每月评定税价税额时，所采批价，无不较实际市场批价为低，如矿产品中之铁，在五月份所采之批价仅达实际市场批价３９％，火柴水泥棉纱在五六两月份所采批价均未达到实际市场批价５０％，所以目始即无税收刺激物价上涨的偏向。
    这种基本精神以后在执行中当然还要继续贯彻。根据条例第五条所载的评价计算公式来看，有以下显著的三个特点。（１）平均批价是以当地市场上月廿五日至本月廿四日一个月的平均批价为根据。因此，决不会由于市价的偶然涨落，而造成评定税价不能公平合理的现象。（２）为了税不征税，所以采用了平均批价被除于一加税率的计算公式，将所纳税款扣除。这样它就不会刺激物价。（３）在物价涨落超过百分之二十五时，得随时将完税价格加以调整，而决不是今天物价涨税也涨的追随办法，而是涨落到四分之一左右才调整，以防止物价波动时，发生促动的作用。
    我们评价的计算公式虽然是根据以往的执行经验，觉得较为妥当，但是全国各解放区间尚存在着有不同的方法。我们为统一全国税制作准备，就须更进一步来研究。（１）根据一个月的市场平均批价是否合适。（２）平均批价除将税款除去外，是否还应酌量减去利润及运费。（３）市价涨落超过四分之一就调整税价，四分之一的比例数字是否恰当，均应就实际执行当中来研究考验。
    （三）票照花证问题
    票照花证都是缴纳税款的凭据，必须兼顾严密和便利的两个原则。此次公布的条例及稽征细则中，对于票证的规定，是以完税证为主要纳税凭证，分运单是完税证的分化作用，完税证明单与查验证是辅助完税证的纳税凭证。用以证明零散货物确系已经纳税的货物。这样的票照制度，是主要纳税凭证与辅助的纳税凭证互相连锁的制度，一方面防止完税证的顶替重用，一方面防止完税证明单的顶替重用。所以是一种比较严密的制度，关于税收制度的既不可失之于严亦不可失之于简，于前文已经加以论述。我们必须根据严简适宜及不妨碍物资交流的两个原则（后者为主）来考察现在的票照制度以求改进。
    （四）违章处罚问题
    我们对于防止走私漏税，主要在于提高群众的觉悟及认识，所以违章案件处理的是基本的精神，是严缉宽处，教育重于处罚。但为了保证税法能够顺利推行，所以必须有罚则的规定。条例第十二条将手续错误，偷漏税款，及触犯刑事，分别轻重，规定了不同的罚则。在稽征细则中，并有较为详密的规定，但是违章情形，千变万化，条例及细则中的规定，是否可以包括，轻重是否适宜，均须在具体执行中，掌握住基本精神，并随时加以考验。
    　　　　五、对本条例应有的认识与今后之希望
    现在新税法既以公布，第一就是怎样将税法贯彻执行，我们全体税工同志在执行货物税工作中，也应较前提高一步，我们应当在此新税法公布的时候，将我们过去的工作重新检查一下。属于优点的，应当继续发扬，属于缺点的，自然不应容许继续存在。在执行条例当中，必须严格保证统一，坚持统一。第一是税目税率的统一，第二是征收手续的统一，均须按照条例贯彻执行。对税法如有疑问，以及遇到税法没有明确规定的事实，必须事先请示，较为重大的事务，必须事后报告，一切无组织无纪律的作风，应严格纠正。更重要的是我们的税收工作必须贯串着群众观点，不要因征税妨害工商业之发展，不要困稽征而使工商业者费事稽时。其次我们必须加紧学习业务深刻体会条例的立法精神才能发挥政策的正确性。我们需要认识税收政策是经济政策的一部分。假如在税收工作上，单从财政观点出发，是错误的。反之，单从片面的仁政观点出发，不能发挥政策之效能，也就不能保证革命战争的供给，也是错误的。因此我们每个税工同志，都要深刻体会到新税法的立法精神，精通业务，才能在执行工作中，不左不右，宽严得宜，以发挥政策的正确性。
    中央人民政府已经成立，全国税政在中央政府领导之下，不久即将取得统一，货物税制度，必将更有改进，我们在执行这部税法当中，应当紧紧的与调查研究工作相结合，吸取实际经验，准备中央政府统一全国税政时，提供参考。所以税工人员对这部税法及细则应负起一面贯彻执行一面研究改进的任务。并且希望学者专家民主人士工商界代表多提些学理上及执行上的意见，以供政府的参考，俾使人民税收工作更提高一步。
