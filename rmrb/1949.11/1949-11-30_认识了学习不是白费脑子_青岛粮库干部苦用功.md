　　Realizing Learning is Not a Waste of Brainpower
  　Qingdao Grain Depot Cadres Work Hard
    [Qingdao News] After repeated mobilization, the learning enthusiasm of cadres in the First Grain Depot of the Second Branch Bureau directly under the Shandong Provincial Grain Bureau has reached an unprecedented level. Before the mobilization for learning, most comrades held the view that: "We are engaged in grain work, there is no need to study. Who doesn't recognize corn and beans? Learning is also a waste of brainpower, and even if you learn well, there is no place to use it." The accountant embraced the erroneous view that: "Just learning to draw circles and dots is enough." Therefore, during the two-hour study time every morning, they would make excuses such as "having work to do" to avoid participating or simply waste time to get by. Seeing this situation, the leadership conducted repeated and in-depth mobilization. They emphasized the importance of learning: "Without learning, you cannot work, nor can you progress, which will hinder your future." They also explained that it is necessary to study even if you are engaged in grain work. Because grain work is inseparable from the construction of the new Qingdao: workers in various factories need grain to start work, work hard, and carry out construction and develop production. After the mobilization, everyone initially realized the importance of learning. Then, they held discussions to examine their thinking. Some comrades said: "In the past, I felt a headache when I heard about learning. Therefore, I felt no interest in my work, and backward thinking ensued. This is a problem of not finding the direction of learning." In particular, everyone was educated through the test: during the test, most comrades were sweating profusely, and they could not find the central point of the test questions even when looking for documents. Everyone realized that this was the result of not learning regularly. Therefore, they expressed their willingness to strengthen learning in the future and improve their political level.
    On the 7th of this month, after the higher authorities summarized the advantages and disadvantages of the previous stage of learning, everyone further realized the importance of learning. After conveying and reporting the study of relevant CPPCC documents in the next stage, a meeting of all cadres was held to mobilize them, calling on them to adhere to the learning system and strive for victory in this study. This further inspired everyone's enthusiasm, corrected the shortcomings in the past learning, and improved the leadership methods: in each document, the group leader in charge of leading the study must identify the key points, through what problems to solve those problems, be fully prepared, save time, and solve more problems. Now the learning enthusiasm of the depot's cadres has generally improved. Every comrade feels that two hours in the morning is too short, so they strive to complete their daily work earlier and read in their spare time. Most comrades have now started taking notes, and the average time for collective learning and self-study is three hours per day.

### 认识了学习不是白费脑子　青岛粮库干部苦用功

　　认识了学习不是白费脑子
  　青岛粮库干部苦用功
    【青岛讯】山东省粮食局直属二分局第一粮库干部经反复动员后，学习情绪空前提高。在动员学习前，大部同志存在着：“咱是干粮食工作的，不用学习。苞米、豆子谁不认识？学习也是白费脑子，学好了也没有地方使。”会计抱着：“只要学会划圈、点点即可。”等轻视学习的错误观点。因此，在每天早晨二小时学习时间内，便借故“有工作”不参加或消磨时间应付了事。领导上见此情况后，即反复深入的进行了动员。着重说明学习的重要性：“不学习就不会工作，也不会进步，对自己的前途是有妨碍的。”又说明干粮食工作也须学习。因为粮食工作与建设新青岛是分不开的：各工厂工人，都需要粮食，才能开工、干活，才可以进行建设与发展生产。经过动员，大家初步认识了学习的重要。接着便座谈检查了思想。有的同志说：“我过去听说学习头就痛。因此在工作中即感觉没有兴趣，落后思想随即产生。这是学习没找着方向的毛病”。尤其是通过测验更教育了大家：在测验的时候，大部同志闷的出大汗，找文件看也找不出试题的中心。大家认识了这是平常不学习的结果。因此纷纷表示今后一定要加强学习。提高政治水平。
    在本月七号经上级总结了前一阶段学习中的优缺点，大家更进一步认识了学习。在传达报告了下阶段有关政协文件的学习后，又召开全体干部会议，进行了动员，号召坚持学习制度，争取这次学习的胜利，更加启发了大家的情绪，又纠正了过去在学习中的缺点，改进了领导方法：在每一文件中领导学习的组长，要找出重点，通过什么问题，去解决那些问题，要有充分准备，又节省时间，解决问题又多。现在该库干部学习情绪普遍提高。每个同志都感到早晨两点钟时间太少了，因此每天的工作都争取早些完成，有空即阅读。大部同志现在已开始记笔记，每天集体学习与自学，平均达三小时。
