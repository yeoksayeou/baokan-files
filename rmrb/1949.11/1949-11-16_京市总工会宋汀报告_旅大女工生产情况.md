　　Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Song Ting Reports
　　Production Situation of Female Workers in Lüda
　　[Beijing News] The Women Workers Department of the Preparatory Committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions convened more than 300 female workers from various factories, districts, and industries in the city on the evening of the 13th to listen to Song Ting, who had recently returned from a visit to the Northeast, report: "Learn from the female worker sisters in Lüda." Song Ting pointed out in his report that the liberated female workers in Lüda, under the leadership of the Lüda District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and with the help of Soviet friends, actively engaged in production and produced a large number of labor heroes and model workers. Among them, the struggle stories of female train drivers and female engineers aroused the envy and admiration of the female workers. He called on everyone to learn from the female worker sisters in Lüda, transform feudal and backward ideas, establish the concept of labor self-reliance, and strive to learn technology, politics, and culture to achieve the emancipation of women in production labor.
