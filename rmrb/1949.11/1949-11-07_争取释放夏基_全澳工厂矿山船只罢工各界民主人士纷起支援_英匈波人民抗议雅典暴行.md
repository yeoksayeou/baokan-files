Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 6th. According to a Sydney report from Diantong News Agency: Throughout Australia, protests against the "sentencing" of Sharkey, General Secretary of the Australian Communist Party, to three years of imprisonment, and demands for his immediate release are escalating. Factories, mines, and ships are staging strikes for this cause, and many Labor Party members, non-partisan workers, peace advocates, and other democrats are supporting the struggle for Sharkey's release. Dixon, Chairman of the Australian Communist Party, wrote in the "Tribune," the organ of the Australian Communist Party, pointing out that Sharkey stands at the forefront of the struggle for lasting peace, defending Australia's independence, and fighting for the rights and freedoms of the masses. Evatt (Australian Attorney-General and Foreign Minister) cannot deny that the Labor Party sent Sharkey to prison precisely for this reason. The sentencing of Sharkey is consistent with the Labor government's comprehensive attack on trade union rights and people's freedoms, as well as the suppression of freedom of speech and the sabotage of strikes. Resolutions demanding Sharkey's release and advocating complete freedom for the cause of peace and friendship with the Soviet Union are pouring into the government from all over Australia.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 6th. People from various countries continue to protest against the death sentences handed down by the Athens royalist fascist reactionary court to nine Greek patriots, demanding the cancellation of the sentences. On the 4th, the Hungarian Trade Union Council, representing 1.6 million organized workers in Hungary, telegraphed the United Nations, protesting against the death sentences passed by the Athens royalist fascist government on nine Greek patriots. The council requested the United Nations to intervene in this matter and demanded the cancellation of the death sentences.

On the same day, a mass delegation of more than 25,000 organized workers from South Wales and Dean Forest in Britain protested to the Athens government's consul in Cardiff against the royalist fascist court's death sentences against Greek trade union leaders. The delegation denounced the rampant bloody terror of the Greek royalist fascists. The consul was forced to promise to send the delegation's request to postpone the execution of Ambatielos and his comrades to the Athens government's embassy in London.

On the 2nd, the Polish Veterans Association telegraphed UN Secretary-General Lie, condemning the atrocities of the Athens fascists and requesting the UN Political Committee to intervene in order to avert the death sentences on Greek patriots.

　　争取释放夏基
  　全澳工厂矿山船只罢工各界民主人士纷起支援
    英匈波人民抗议雅典暴行
    【新华社北京六日电】据电通社悉尼讯：澳大利亚全国各地对于“判决”澳共总书记夏基三年徒刑的抗议和立即释放夏基的要求正日益高涨。各工厂、矿山、船只纷纷为此举行罢工，许多工党党员和无党无派工人、拥护和平分子及其他民主人士，都支持争取夏基释放的斗争。澳大利亚共产党主席狄克逊在澳共机关报“论坛报”上著论指出：夏基站在争取持久和平、保卫澳大利亚独立及争取群众的权利与自由的斗争中的最前列。伊瓦特（澳检察长兼外长）也不能否认工党把夏基送入监狱，正是因为这个原因。判处夏基罪刑，是与工党政府对工会权利、人民自由的全面进攻和镇压言论自由与破坏罢工一致的。要求释放夏基，和主张和平事业及对苏友好的完全自由的决议书，正自全澳各地涌入政府。
    【新华社北京六日电】各国人民对雅典保皇法西斯反动法庭判处希腊爱国者九人的死刑，继续纷纷提出抗议，要求取消判决。四日匈牙利工会理事会代表全匈一百六十万有组织的工人致电联合国，抗议雅典保皇法西斯政府通过对九位希腊爱国者的死刑判决。该理事会要求联合国干预此事，并要求取消死刑判决。
    同日，英国南威尔士与迪因森林二万五千多名有组织的工人的群众代表团，向雅典政府驻加迪夫领事，抗议保皇法西斯法庭对希腊工会领袖判决死刑。代表团痛斥希腊保皇法西斯猖獗的血腥恐怖。该领事已被迫答应把代表团所提关于延缓处决阿姆巴西洛斯及其同志们的要求，送交雅典政府驻伦敦的大使馆。
    二日，波兰战士联盟致电联合国秘书长莱氏，谴责雅典法西斯的暴行，并要求联合国政治委员会进行干涉，以免除对希腊爱国者的死刑判决。
