Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 26th: The Taiyuan Branch of the North China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company has recently improved its methods for lending yarn to private small-scale cotton weaving industries, in order to correct the past tendencies of reduced fabric quality and dispersed production resulting from the universal practice of lending yarn and collecting cloth. After the liberation of Taiyuan, the company implemented a system of lending yarn and collecting cloth, which enabled many small-scale cotton weaving businesses in the city to quickly resume production. However, the yarn lending methods failed to differentiate between cotton weaving factories based on their size, capital, and management situation, either by lending yarn accordingly or by adopting other support methods. Similarly, cloth collection did not pay attention to product quality, resulting in cotton weaving businesses focusing solely on delivering goods and making money, without actively improving tools or enhancing technology. Some cotton weaving businesses that originally had the ability to operate independently also relied on yarn loans instead of finding their own sources of raw materials. Some individual factories even diverted their original capital into speculation. Some factories had only two or three machines and no capital, relying entirely on yarn loans to start production. In order to change this situation, the Taiyuan Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company has specifically redefined the following yarn lending principles: 1. Cotton weaving businesses with the ability to operate independently will no longer be provided with yarn loans and cloth collection services; they will be encouraged to purchase their own raw materials and sell their products independently. However, the company will facilitate their purchase of yarn. 2. Yarn loans will be terminated for those who divert capital into speculation and profiteering. 3. Only factories with five or more looms that lack capital and are temporarily unable to operate will be eligible for yarn loan contracts with the company. Factories with fewer than five looms will not be lent yarn for the time being. 4. Those who lack capital due to improvements in tools and quality can continue to receive assistance in the form of yarn loans and cloth collection. Whether or not to lend yarn must be determined through repeated research by the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company in conjunction with the Taiyuan Industrial and Commercial Bureau and the cotton weaving industry itself. There are currently more than ninety small-scale cotton weaving businesses with five or more looms in Taiyuan. After evaluation, Henghe and thirteen other factories were deemed to have the ability to operate independently and will no longer be provided with yarn loans. Yarn loan and cloth collection contracts were revised for six factories, including Xinxin, to help them improve tools and enhance technology. Another seventy-six factories will be temporarily lent a portion of cotton yarn, encouraging them to gradually operate independently. Currently, cotton weaving businesses in Taiyuan have begun to understand the spirit of these yarn lending principles, changing their past view of relying entirely on the government, and are actively adding tools and expanding their operations.

　　纠正普遍贷纱收布偏向
  　太原花纱布公司改进贷纱办法
    鼓励各棉织厂独立经营  改良工具设备提高技术
    【新华社太原二十六日电】华北花纱布公司太原分公司顷改进对私营小型棉织工业的贷纱办法，以纠正过去由于普遍贷纱收布所产生的织品质量降低与生产分散等偏向。太原市解放后，该公司即实行贷纱收布办法，使该市的许多小型棉织业得以迅速恢复生产。但因在贷纱方法上未能区分棉织工厂规模大小与资金、经营等情况，分别贷纱，或分别采用其他扶助方法；收布亦未注意其产品的质量，以致棉织业者只顾交货赚钱，不积极改进工具，提高技术。有些棉织业者本来具有独立经营的能力，但也依靠贷纱而不自找原料来源。更有个别工厂腾出原有资金，进行投机。有的工厂只有两、三台机子，资本毫无，就完全依靠贷纱开工。为了改变这一情况，太原花纱布公司特重新确定了以下的贷纱原则：一、具有独立经营能力之棉织业者，不再予以贷纱收布，鼓励其自买原料自行推销；但公司予以购纱的便利。二、对于腾出资本投机倒把者，停止贷纱。三、必须具有布机五台以上的工厂，而又缺少资本，一时无力经营者，公司才与之订立货纱合同。五台以下的工厂暂不贷纱。四、凡因改进工具，提高质量而资本不足者，仍可继续予以贷纱收布的扶助。贷纱与否并须经花纱布公司协同太原工商局的反复研究和棉织业自己的评议。太原现有五台布机以上的小型棉织业共九十余家。经评议后，恒和等十三厂因已具有独立经营能力，不再予以贷纱。对新新等六厂则改订了贷纱收布的合同，以帮助他们改进工具，提高技术。另七十六家则暂贷给部分棉纱，鼓励他们逐步独立经营。现太原市各棉织业者已开始体会这些贷纱原则的精神，改变过去完全依赖政府的观点，纷纷添置工具，扩大经营。
