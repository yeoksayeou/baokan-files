　　Guangzhou Holds Workers' Forum
　　Relying on the Working Class to Build a New Guangzhou
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou Electric Dispatch] The Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Preparatory Office of the Guangzhou Federation of Trade Unions, and representatives of the Guangzhou Military Control Commission jointly convened a workers' forum in Guangzhou on the afternoon of October 24th. More than 800 worker representatives from 23 units, including the Yuehan Railway Bureau, the Telecommunications Bureau, the Postal Bureau, the Electric Light Company, and the Water Company, attended the forum. When the worker representatives, in groups, walked into the meeting place, which was decorated with a five-star national flag and huge portraits of Chairman Mao Zedong and Commander-in-Chief Zhu De, they were all elated and joyful. After Zhu Jingwen, Deputy Director of the Preparatory Office of the Guangzhou Federation of Trade Unions, announced the opening of the meeting, Zhu Guang, a representative of the Military Control Commission, spoke first. He pointed out that since the failure of the Guangzhou Uprising in 1927, the Communist Party, the party of the Chinese working class, had experienced countless arduous struggles before finally returning to Guangzhou to meet with its class brothers and sisters and discuss how to build a new Guangzhou for the people together. In order to build a new Guangzhou for the people well, Zhu Guang asked the Guangzhou working class, with its glorious revolutionary tradition, to unite with the people of all democratic strata in Guangzhou and, as masters, first do the following things: (1) Assist the People's Liberation Army and the People's Government in carrying out takeover work. (2) Strive to restore production. (3) Maintain law and order and eliminate hidden agents and saboteurs. After Zhu Guang's speech, worker representatives stood up and spoke one after another. A worker representative from the mail carrier group of the Postal Bureau said: "Under the rule of the reactionary government, we workers never dreamed that we could come here to attend a meeting. The working class has only today under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. Now we must mobilize all of us and use practical actions to protect our own power, which belongs to the working class and all the people." Worker representatives from the Electric Light Company, the Public Transport Company, the Yuehan Railway Bureau, the Waterworks, the China Merchants Bureau, and sailors spoke next. In their speeches, they put forward many specific opinions on takeover work and public security work. The representatives were extremely excited, and some even lost their voices, waving their hands and shouting: "Resolutely follow the Communist Party! Follow Chairman Mao!" The whole audience kept applauding and cheering. Finally, Liao Siguang, Executive Committee Member of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and Director of the Preparatory Office of the Guangzhou Federation of Trade Unions, stood up and delivered a speech. After analyzing the tasks of the working class in the current stage of the revolution, she represented the All-China Federation of Trade Unions in calling on everyone to quickly establish trade unions at all levels that truly represent the interests of the working class. At the close of the meeting, Zhu Guang paid tribute to the city's workers who worked hard to restore public utilities and public services after the liberation of Guangzhou, and sincerely encouraged them to work together to build a new Guangzhou for the people.
