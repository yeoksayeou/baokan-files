Chahar League Epidemic Area Overcomes Superstition
Establish Basic-Level Epidemic Prevention Organizations
Guarding, Cleaning, and Catching Rats Have Become Conscious Actions of the Masses

[Our Correspondent in Chahar League, 14th Dispatch] In villages in the Chahar League's Chahan Beng Beng, Longwangmiao, Qian Houtu and other areas affected by the plague, basic-level epidemic prevention organizations have been established, and a mass epidemic prevention and sanitation campaign is now underway. The plague in Chahan Beng Beng first occurred in early August. Before the epidemic prevention personnel arrived, the masses were quite panicked, and superstitious rumors spread. After the epidemic prevention team and medical personnel from the Chahar Provincial Health Bureau arrived in the Chahar League epidemic area before October 26, they cooperated with local administrative cadres to strengthen the blockade of the above-mentioned villages, strictly prohibiting people from going out and visiting each other, implementing household lockdowns, and conducting detailed investigations of the epidemic, disinfecting plague-stricken houses, and handling them on the spot. At the same time, they launched extensive epidemic prevention propaganda among local village cadres and the masses. Anti-plague propaganda was posted everywhere in the villages, and blackboard newspapers and rooftop broadcasts were used to tell the farmers the reasons why the plague harms people and how to prevent it. After the Third Detachment of the Central Epidemic Prevention Team arrived at the beginning of this month, it carried out comprehensive injections and comprehensive examinations in the 60-mile radius around Chahan Beng Beng village. It also cooperated with local administration to jointly build basic epidemic prevention organizations in various villages. Now in villages such as Chahan Beng Beng and Longwangmiao, a health team leader has been selected for every 25 households, and a health committee member is set up in each village to be responsible for reporting the diseases and deaths in the village to the district immediately. The masses are encouraged to clean their houses and courtyards, and everyone is involved in epidemic prevention. Under the leadership of the village cadres, the blockade has become a conscious action of the villagers' militia and the masses, who take turns on duty day and night, and no one is let go without a pass from the epidemic prevention headquarters. Each household sweeps the house and courtyard once every morning and evening. In the countryside, where people used to defecate everywhere, every household has dug a manure pit; cattle dung is also pulled to the wilderness. Many people often sun their quilts, use fire to burn their houses, and eliminate fleas. Although the weather is very cold, everyone is digging rat ditches. With the help of Soviet animal experts and the epidemic prevention rat-catching team, a rat-catching campaign has also been launched. They said, "If we don't want people to die, we have to destroy this scourge." Everyone has knowledge and prevention methods, and they are all at ease in handling household affairs.

  　建立基层防疫组织
    站岗、清洁、捕鼠已成群众自觉行动
    【本报记者察盟十四日专电】察盟察汉崩崩、龙王庙、前后音图等受到鼠疫侵袭的村庄，防疫基层组织均已建立，现已展开群众性的防疫与清洁卫生运动。察汉崩崩之鼠疫最初发生于八月上旬，当防疫人员尚未赶到之前，群众颇为慌乱，迷信传说纷纷。防疫队及察省卫生局医务人员先后于十月二十六日前赶抵察盟疫区后，即配合当地行政干部加强上述各村的封锁，严禁出门乱串门子，实行户户封锁，并详细调查疫情，进行患疫房屋消毒及就地处理等工作，一面对当地村干部及群众展开广泛的防疫宣传，各村处处贴上了防治鼠疫的宣传品、并利用黑板报，屋顶广播，告诉农民们鼠疫伤人的道理和预防的办法。中央防疫队第三中队于本月初到达后，一面进行察汉崩崩村周围六十里的全面注射与全面检诊。并配合当地行政，协同建设各村防疫基础组织。现察汉崩崩，龙王庙等村，已每二十五户选出一卫生小组长，每村设一卫生委员负责将本村的疾病与死亡立时向区报告。推动群众清扫房院，大家防疫，在村干部的领导下，封锁已成为全村民兵与群众的自觉行动，日夜轮流站岗，没有防疫指挥部的路条，谁也不放过。各户每早每晚清扫一次房院，一向随地便溺的农村，家家都挖了粪坑；牛粪也拉到了野地里。不少群众经常晒被子，用火燎房子，消灭跳蚤，天虽很冷，大家都在挖鼠沟；在苏联动物专家及防疫捕鼠队的帮助下，并展开了捕鼠运动。他们说：“要想不死人，可得灭了这祸根子”。大家有了认识与预防办法，都已安心处理家务了。
