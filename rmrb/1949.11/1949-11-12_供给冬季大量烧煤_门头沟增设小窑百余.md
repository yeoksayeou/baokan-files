    Supplying a Large Amount of Coal for Winter
    Mentougou Adds Over a Hundred Small Coal Kilns
    [Our Dispatch] The Mentougou mining area in Beijing is actively draining water and starting work in various public and private coal kilns to meet the large demand for winter coal. In October, 126 small coal kilns started operations, employing 8,079 workers, with a daily output of 1,129 tons of coal. The two state-owned large coal mines employ 3,286 workers, producing around 700 tons of coal daily. In October, two more privately owned large coal mines opened, with a daily output of 217 tons of coal.
    Due to the increase in small coal kilns, the number of disaster victims from counties such as Gu'an, Renqiu, Wuyi, Raoyang, Shunyi, and Baodi who have moved to the mining area to make a living is increasing daily. In October, the population of Mentougou increased by 4,250 compared to September, which has solved the problem of food for a large number of disaster victims.

    供给冬季大量烧煤
    门头沟增设小窑百余
    【本报讯】京市门头沟矿区，为供应冬季烧煤的大量需求，自十月份以来各公私煤窑积极排水开工。计十月份开工的有小窑一百二十六个，工人八千零七十九人，日产煤一千一百二十九吨，公营大窑两座，工人三千二百八十六名，每日出煤七百顿上下，私营大窑十月份多开两个，每日出煤二百一十七吨。
    由于小窑增多，各灾区如固安、任邱、武邑、饶阳、顺义、宝坻等县灾民移来矿区谋生者日众，十月份门头沟人口较九月份增加四千二百五十人。解决了很大一部分灾民的吃饭问题。
