Executing the Beijing Military Control Commission Military Law Department's Verdict
Profiteer Wang Zhenting and Others Escorted to Prison
Tian Bailin and Eight Others Seek Bail and Are Given a Deadline to Pay Fines

[Beijing News] The case of profiteers Wang Zhenting, Tian Yuchuan, and others, who purchased wheat from the grain company, hoarded it, refused to sell, and raised grain prices, was judged by the Beijing Military Control Commission Military Law Department yesterday (27th) at 1:40 AM. The profiteers Wang Zhenting and Tian Yuchuan were escorted to North China First Prison yesterday afternoon at 2:30 PM to carry out the verdict. Tian Bailin, Qu Yaoting, Wu Zizhong, Tian Yuzeng, Fan Zihe, Yang Weisan, Lü Aiting, and Li Jingjun were educated by the Military Control Commission Military Law Department and have been ordered to find reputable shopkeepers as guarantors to ensure that the fines imposed are paid in full by the 5th of next month. When the car escorted Wang Zhenting and Tian Yuchuan through Qianmen, Zhushikou, Hufangqiao, Caishikou and other places, the car was stopped several times by citizens who shouted slogans such as "Severely Punish Profiteers." Citizens were satisfied with the punishment given to profiteers Wang Zhenting and Tian Yuchuan by the Military Control Commission Military Law Department. Peng Yongfu, a citizen in his fifties, pointed at Wang Zhenting and said: "When the Japanese were here and during the Kuomintang rule, you always manipulated prices and disrupted people's lives. Now that Beijing is liberated, you still haven't changed. Bad people like you should be punished like this!" (Attached Picture)

　　执行京市军管会军法处判决
  　奸商王振廷等押赴监狱
    田柏林等八人觅保限期缴清罚金
    【北京讯】奸商王振廷、田雨川等十人，套购粮食分公司小麦，囤积拒售，高抬粮价一案，昨（二十七）晨一时四十分由北京军管会军法处宣布判决后，奸商王振廷、田雨川二人已于昨日下午二时半押赴华北第一监狱执行判决。田柏林、曲耀亭、武子忠、田裕曾、范子和、杨畏三、吕霭庭、李敬钧等八人经军管会军法处教育后，已令他们觅取殷实铺保，保证在下月五日前将判处之罚金全数缴清。当汽车押解王振廷、田雨川二人经过前门、珠市口、虎坊桥、菜市口等地时，汽车曾数次被市民阻住，高喊“严惩奸商”等口号。市民对军管会军法处给予奸商王振延、田雨川的惩处，认为满意。五十多岁的市民彭永福指着王振廷说：日本在的时候和国民党统治的时候，你一直操纵物价，扰乱人民生活。北京解放了，你还不改。象你这样的坏东西，就得这样惩治你！”（附图片）
