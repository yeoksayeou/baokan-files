Drop Your Personal Plans!
    —A Letter to My Brother
    Zhou Xuemin, Wofo Temple Elementary School

    Hai Lian, my brother:
    In ten days, I received three letters from you in a row, written in such a disheartening way. At first, I was just anxious, but later I became somewhat angry.

    Before the summer vacation, you returned from the Northeast, excitedly telling me about the situation after the liberation of the Northeast: the people were highly dependent on the leadership of the Communist Party, actively increasing production, and unprecedented developments were taking place in industry and people's education, with significant achievements already made. You also told me about our maternal grandfather—a landlord with one *qing* of land—who also complied with the new policies, organizing the whole family to knit socks while telling our rich young third uncle to go to a revolutionary school to study, and even becoming the leader of a workgroup himself. Our maternal grandfather's family not only didn't starve because of land confiscation but lived even more vigorously. During the summer vacation studies, you were in high spirits. Even mother said, "This child has truly learned well!" In the evening, we sat together to discuss the outlines, and you also showed progress. You know how happy I was! When service personnel were registered for assignments in other areas, you volunteered to sign up. On August 17th, it was announced that you would be serving at the No. 2 Elementary School in Taiyuan, Shanxi. The night before you left, the whole family gathered around you, earnestly offering instructions. Mother, old and often ill, was about to shed tears as you left, but you took her hand and said, "This is not a farewell; this is the beginning of my service to the people. Home is wherever I am, no matter how far!"

    However, after only two months, you, who couldn't withstand the test of reality, wrote me a letter full of nonsense: "Life is hard," "children are unintelligent," "colleagues are difficult"; you miss home, miss mother, miss your fiancée, Xiao Ping... I showed your letter to Xiao Ping, and she cried in disappointment. Because she thought that your willingness to serve in a distant place at that time proved that you were progressive in thought. Moreover, since you left, she has been working hard to study revolutionary theory. When their central district selected model teachers, she won a second-place certificate and has now formally joined the Communist Youth League, busy with work and study day and night, afraid of falling behind you when she sees you during the winter vacation. But now, the person she loves most has fallen behind her, which is too unexpected for her!

    What makes me most angry is the selfish thinking of "too hard, can't earn much money, this will affect my health." Think about it: how many revolutionary cadres have not served the people and struggled hard for ten or twenty years? Who has ever thought about "earning money"? Who doesn't need health? However, before the living standards of the working people are improved, you shouldn't refuse to work because of "earning money" and "health." And you, having worked for less than three months, are already thinking about "earning money" and fearing that it will "affect my health." What a selfish thought! Did you join the revolution just to "earn money" for your own personal enjoyment? After a few turns, you still haven't shaken off the old idea of getting promoted and getting rich. No wonder Xiao Ping, who loves you, is so angry that she cries, and I—your sister—can't restrain my anger either!

    Brother, you have exposed the tail of your individualism again. You value your own interests too much. The thoughts of the old society are terribly poisoning you. You even write, "The children are happily nibbling on cornbread, and I feel worried when I see the rolled oat noodles," to gain the sympathy of your lover and me. What a terrible backward thought! Brother, aren't those "children" human beings? Don't they need more nutrition? In the face of this vivid reality, you not only fail to recognize the importance of our responsibilities and strengthen your determination to serve the people, but you also feel that you should be different from others, and even dismiss the rolled oat noodles! Brother, what are you talking about progress and revolution for? Isn't this a kind of self-superiority of the exploiting class?

    You also say, "The children in Shanxi are too strange and unintelligent… teaching elementary school is looked down upon… doesn't suit my interests… I miss home…" These words fully demonstrate your lack of responsibility towards your work and that your feudal thoughts are still very strong. Can people from Hebei Province only teach children in Hebei Province? Brother, as long as you are determined to be a teacher of the masses of the new China, the children there will welcome you. You say they are unintelligent, I think it's probably because you haven't done your best. You tell them only the things that make you happy, the things you understand, without patiently going into the children's group to understand them. Of course, they don't welcome you. I remember last year when I was a fourth-grade homeroom teacher, the order was very chaotic at first, and the children didn't listen to me very much. Later, I realized that it was my own mistake. I wrote two questions on the blackboard: "1. Do you like me? 2. Do you dislike me? Why?" The children bowed their heads one by one and carefully wrote sincere words. At night, I finished reading them and made a summary. They said, "Why do you always take notes? You talk too deeply, you don't like to play, tell more stories!" I accepted their valuable opinions, and in a month, not only did the fourth-grade children like me, but all the children in the school liked me and loved me. Therefore, if your understanding and attitude towards the work you are in charge of are based on the correct standpoint, you will definitely be interested in the work, and you will love the elementary school students like your own children, reluctant to leave them, and the more you teach, the happier you will be.

    Xiao Ping tore up all the letters you wrote to her. She doesn't want to see the selfish "amorous" sentences you write anymore. She wants you to dedicate all your love for her to the children you are teaching. She is eagerly hoping that you will study hard to transform your thoughts, and truly combine theory with practice, so that when you meet during the winter vacation, you will no longer be like this. Brother, I am also looking forward to you in the same way!

Your sister, November 6th

### 丢掉个人打算！——写给弟弟的信

    丢掉个人打算！
    ——写给弟弟的信
    卧佛寺小学  周学敏
    海琏弟：
    十天里我一连接到你三封信，写得那么使人不快意，起初我只是着急，后来我却有些忿怒了。
    暑假前你从东北回来，激动的和我谈起东北解放后的情形：人民都在高度的依赖共产党的领导，积极增产，在工业和人民教育方面都空前的发展着，并已有显著的成绩。你还说起了外祖父——一个一顷地的地主，也服从了新政策，一面发动全家织袜子，一面叫阔少三舅到革命学校去学习，并且自己还当了工作组的小组长。外祖家不但没有因献地而挨饿，还更生活得有劲。暑期学习时，你学习情绪很高。连母亲也说：“这孩子真学好了！”晚上我们坐在一起讨论提纲，你也表现得进步了，你知道，我是多高兴啊！外地服务人员登记，你也自愿的报名，八月十七发表了你去山西太原第二小学服务。临走前晚，全家围着你谆谆嘱咐，母亲年老多病，看你走要落泪，你却拉着娘的手说：“这不是别离，这正是我为人民服务的开始，天涯海角那里都是家！”
    然而，才两月的功夫，经不起实际考验的你，写给我满纸的废话：“生活清苦”，“儿童低能”，“同仁不和”；又想家，想母亲，想你的未婚妻小平……，我把你给我的信，给小平看，她失望的哭了。因为她想，你当时能到远地服务，证明在思想上已是一个进步，而且，自你走后，她努力的学习着革命理论，她们中心区选模范教员时，她得了第二名奖状，现在已正式加入青年团，日夜的忙着工作和学习，怕在寒假见你时落在你的后面。可是现在，她最爱的人却落在她的后面了，太出她的意外了！
    最使我忿怒的是什么“太清苦，挣不到几个钱，这样下去会影响我的健康”的自私的思想，你想想：多少革命干部不是为人民服务，艰苦奋斗了十年，二十年？谁想过“挣钱”？谁又不需要健康？然而，当劳动人民的生活水平还未提高以前，更不应为“赚钱”“健康”而不愿干工作了。而你，参加工作还不到三月，就想到“挣钱”啦，恐怕“影响我的健康”啦，这是多么自私的想法！难道你参加革命就是为了“挣钱”，为了自己个人的享受吗？转几个弯儿，你仍然没有摆脱升官发财的旧思想，无怪爱你的小平气得哭，而我——你的姐姐亦遏制不住心中忿怒呵！
    弟弟，你又暴露了你的个人主义的尾巴了，你把自己的利益看得太重，旧社会的思想可怕的毒害着你，你居然会写出：“孩子们啃着窝窝头笑嘻嘻的，我看见那莜面卷子就发愁”的话，以博得你的爱人和我的同情，这是多么可怕的落后思想呵！弟弟，难道那些“孩子们”就不是人？就不更需要营养？你在这种活生生的实际面前，不仅未想到我们的责任的重大而加强自己为人民服务的决心，反而觉得自己应当与众不同，莜面卷子也不堪一顾！弟弟，你还谈什么进步，革命呢？这不是一种剥削阶级的自我优越感吗？
    你又说：“山西的孩子太古怪，又低能……教小学，人家看不起……不合我的兴趣……我想家……”这些话充分的表现你对工作缺乏责任心，封建思想还很强，河北省人只能教河北省的孩子吗？弟弟，只要你决心做一个新中国人民大众的教师，那里的孩子都欢迎你的，你说他们低能，我想许是你自己太未尽责了，你向他们说的都是你自己高兴的事，你自己懂得的话，没有耐心地到孩子们群里去了解他们，他们当然不欢迎你，记得去年我是担任四年级级任，起初秩序很混乱，孩子们不大听我的话，后来才发现是自己的错误，我在黑板上写出两个问题“一、你们喜欢我吗？二、你们不喜欢我吗？都为什么呢？”孩子们一个个低着头仔细的写出了真诚话，夜间，我看完了，做出了总结。他们说“为什么你老写笔记？讲的太深，老不爱玩，你多讲几个故事吧！”我接受了他们宝贵的意见，一月功夫，不但四年级的孩子们喜欢我，全校的孩子们都喜欢我，都爱我。所以，自己对自己担任的工作认识和态度，如果是从正确的立场观点出发的话、一定会对工作发生兴趣，对小学生就会象自己子女一样地热爱他们，舍不得丢开他们，愈教也就愈高兴了。
    小平把你写给她的信都撕掉了，她不愿意再见到你写的那种自私“钟情”的句子，要你把热爱她的心，全部献给你正教育着的孩子们，她在迫切的盼你努力学习改造思想，真正把理论和实践结合起来，寒假见面时，你已经不再是这个样子。弟弟，我也同样地盼望着你！
              姐姐十一月六日
