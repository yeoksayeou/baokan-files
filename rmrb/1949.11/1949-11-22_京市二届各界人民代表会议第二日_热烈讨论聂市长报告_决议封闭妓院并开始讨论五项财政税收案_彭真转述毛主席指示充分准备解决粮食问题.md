    [Beijing News] The second day of the Beijing Municipal Second All-Circles People's Representative Conference (November 21st) saw the delegates enthusiastically discussing Mayor Nie Rongzhen's report on the work of the municipal government. They unanimously passed a resolution on closing brothels and began discussing the five fiscal and taxation proposals put forward by the municipal government. The conference began at 2:30 PM yesterday, with a total of 379 delegates in attendance. Nie Rongzhen, Wen Jiasi, Zhang Xiaomei, Han Zhuoru, and Chuan Huating served as executive chairpersons of the presidium. When the chairman announced the start of the discussion on Mayor Nie's report, delegates eagerly signed up to speak. Among those who spoke were union representatives Song Fengxiang, Yang Kaiwen, Guo Caizhang, Liu Zhendong, Li Yukou, Li Shumin (female), Chou Fangyu, and Wang Wenbin; farmer representatives Guan Zongyin, Zhang Shuzhen (female), Sun Zhengmin, Liu Wanfu, and Cao Jianrong; women's representative Zeng Zhaoyi; youth representative Zhuang Zhihui; student representative Gu Qizong; representatives of primary and secondary school teachers and staff Xu Chubo; representatives of college and university teachers and staff Yan Jici; representative of industrial and commercial circles Xu Zhushi; medical worker representative Luo Guizhen (female); journalist representative Chen Mingde; public security forces representative Luo Wenfang; literary and art circles representative Lian Kuoru; ethnic minority representative Ma Yuhuai; democratic professors Fan Hong, Qian Weichang, and Wu Jiwen; representative of the Beijing branch of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang Zhou Fanwen; representative of the Beijing branch of the China Democratic League Wen Jiasi; representative of the preparatory committee of the Beijing party affairs of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party Zhang Yunchuan; representative of the Beijing Working Committee of the Communist Youth League Zhang Dazhong; representative of the Beijing branch of the China Democratic National Construction Association Wang Biao, and others, totaling thirty-two people. They all expressed their satisfaction on behalf of their respective units with Mayor Nie's report, believing that the municipal government had earnestly implemented over ninety percent of the resolutions of the previous representative conference and was a government that truly represented the interests of the broad masses of the people. Everyone unanimously supported the municipal construction guidelines and plans for the future put forward by Mayor Nie and pledged to assist the municipal government and strive to realize these guidelines and plans. In their speeches, delegates called on the municipal government to continue to eliminate the remaining counter-revolutionary forces, severely punish profiteering merchants who raise prices, and demanded the swift elimination and closure of brothels. The delegates believed that in a new democratic society, in the people's capital of Beijing, such a barbaric system should absolutely not be allowed to continue to exist. (Speeches by representatives are reported separately.)
    After the discussion of Mayor Nie's report was completed, the executive chairman of the conference announced the discussion of the motion on closing brothels prepared by the previous consultation committee. Then, the executive chairman Zhang Xiaomei explained the motion based on the motion prepared by the previous consultation committee. She emphasized that these brothels are remnants of feudal society, spread syphilis and gonorrhea, and greatly endanger the health of the people. They should be closed immediately, and all brothel owners, managers, and pimps should be concentrated for examination and handling. Furthermore, the prostitutes should be concentrated for training and resettlement separately. Zhang Xiaomei also read out the rationale for the case, which was met with prolonged and enthusiastic applause from all the delegates. They unanimously raised their hands to pass it (the full text of the resolution is in another article) and handed it over to the municipal government for immediate implementation. Mayor Nie Rongzhen immediately stated that the municipal government would implement it immediately. All the delegates were extremely moved by Mayor Nie's democratic spirit of immediately implementing the resolution of the conference. When Mayor Nie issued the order for immediate implementation, the audience burst into thunderous applause, and the atmosphere of the meeting became even more enthusiastic.
    The conference then proceeded to discuss the five fiscal and taxation proposals put forward by the municipal government. Before the discussion, Deputy Mayor Zhang Youyu explained that the reason for levying taxes was that the construction of the people's capital required a large amount of funds. These taxes are all existing taxes, not new taxes. It's just that the tax system has been simplified to reduce the burden on the people and the number of tax items has been reduced. Although the regulations on collection have been repeatedly studied by the municipal government, the consultation committee, and experts from all parties for several months, it is still hoped that the conference will discuss them. If any deviations are found during implementation, the government will correct them at any time. These taxes are "taken from the people of Beijing and used for the construction of Beijing." The conference can supervise and inspect their use (the full text of Deputy Mayor Zhang's report is in another article). After Deputy Mayor Zhang's report, seven representatives including Zhu Changjiang, Zhang Jiantang, Tang Shaoyuan, Ai Zhicheng, Wang Zihong, Hu Quangui, and Guan Zongyin spoke in succession, expressing their support for the various fiscal and taxation proposals put forward by the government. By this time, it was already 6:10 PM, and it was late. The presidium decided that the tax issue was closely related to the interests of the people from all walks of life, and for the sake of prudence, so that everyone would have sufficient time to consider it, the discussion would be suspended that night and continued the next day.
    Finally, the chairman of the conference, Peng Zhen, reported to the conference with great excitement that he and Mayor Nie Rongzhen had presented the resolution passed by the conference on closing brothels to Chairman Mao (all applauded enthusiastically). He reported to Chairman Mao on how to deal with brothel owners, concentrate prostitutes for education, "treat prostitutes for venereal diseases, and after they are cured, prostitutes who have homes to return to will be sent home, those who have marriage partners will be helped to get married, and the rest will be organized to learn handicrafts and engage in production to seek self-reliance." When Peng Zhen relayed Chairman Mao's words to the conference, "This resolution is very good," it immediately aroused thunderous applause from everyone. Then he reported that Chairman Mao was very concerned about the grain problem of the people of Beijing and instructed us to fully prepare to solve the supply of grain to Beijing, Tianjin, and disaster areas. After hearing this, all the representatives applauded enthusiastically and shouted "Long live Chairman Mao!" Then he reported the opinions of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China on increasing more than one hundred state-owned grain retail stores and cooperatives, and first solving the grain problem for more than one million households of workers, students, teachers and staff, working people, and the poor in the city, and asked the conference to consider it. After the speech, the applause of all the attending representatives lasted for a long time.
    During the conference that day, students from all over Beijing and ethnic minorities such as Hui, Mongolian, and Tibetan successively presented banners to the conference, reading "Cheering for the People's Democratic Conference" and "People of All Ethnic Groups Unite to Build the People's Capital."

    聂市长报告讨论完毕，大会执行主席即宣布讨论上届协商委员会所准备的关于封闭妓院议案。接着即由执行主席张晓梅根据上届协商委员会所准备议案加以说明，她强调的指出：这些妓院是封建社会的残余，传染梅毒淋病，危害国民健康极大，应立即加以封闭，集中所有妓院老板、领家、鸨儿等加以审查和处理，并集中妓女加以训练，分别安置等，张晓梅并朗读该案的案由，得到全场代表的长时间的热烈鼓掌，一致举手通过（决议原文见另条），并交由市政府立即执行。聂荣臻市长当即表示市政府马上执行。全体代表对聂市长此种立即执行大会决议的民主精神极为感动，当聂市长发布了立即执行的命令之后，全场掌声雷动，会场情绪更为高涨。
    大会继即进行讨论市政府所提出的五项财政税收提案，讨论前，由张友渔副市长说明征税原因是因为建设人民的首都需要很大的费用。这几种税，都是旧有的，并非新税，只是由于简化税制，减轻人民负担，把税目减少了。征收条例，虽已经市政府、协商委员会和各方专家数月来一再研究，仍希大会加以讨论。在执行中如发现偏向，政府一定随时纠正。这些税收，是“取之于北京人民，用之于北京建设”。大会可监督检查其用途（张副市长报告全文，见另条）。在张副市长报告结束后，朱长江、张俭堂、汤绍远、艾志诚、王子宏、胡泉贵、管宗印等七代表相继发言，对政府所提出的各项财政税收案表示拥护。这时，已经六点十分，为时已晚，主席团决定，税收问题与各界人民利益有密切关系，为了慎重起见，使大家有充分时间考虑，当晚暂停讨论，次日再继续进行。
    最后，大会主席彭真以极兴奋的心情，向大会报告他和聂荣臻市长已将大会通过关于封闭妓院的决议面陈毛主席（全体大鼓掌）。向主席报告了将如何处理妓院老板，集中妓女给以教育，“给妓女医治性病，治好后，有家可归的妓女，将送其回家，有结婚对象者将帮助其结婚，其余的即组织她们学习手艺，进行生产，以谋生活之自立。”当彭真向大会转述毛主席的话说：“这个决议很好。”立刻引起全体大鼓掌。接着他报告毛主席非常关心北京市人民的粮食问题，指示我们充分准备解决京津和灾区粮食的供应问题。全场代表听到之后，报以热烈的鼓掌，并高呼“毛主席万岁”！接着他又报告了中国共产党北京市委员会关于增设百余公营粮食零售店和合作社，首先解决本市工人、学生、教职员、劳动人民及贫民等百余万升斗小户人民的粮食问题的意见，请大会考虑。讲话毕，全体出席代表掌声历久不息。
    是日大会中，有北京市全市学生和回、蒙、藏等少数民族先后向大会献“为人民民主的大会而欢呼”和“各族人民团结起来共建人民首都”锦旗。
