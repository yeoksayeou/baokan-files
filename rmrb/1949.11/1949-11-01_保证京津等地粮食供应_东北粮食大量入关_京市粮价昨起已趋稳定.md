　　[Report from this newspaper] In order to enrich the grain supply in North China and guarantee the grain supply in Beijing, Tianjin and other places, the Northeast Grain Corporation and the North China Grain Corporation have signed a grain supply contract. Large quantities of food grain are now entering the customs continuously. Grain prices in Beijing have been stabilizing since yesterday (31st). According to the contract, the Northeast Grain Corporation guarantees to transport 5 million jin of grain into the customs every day from October 29th to the end of this year, which will be distributed to Beijing, Tianjin, Baoding, Cangzhou and other places. At the same time, the Northeast Finance and Economics Committee has also decided to unfreeze the grain of various financial and economic departments in North China that was previously frozen in the Northeast, and allow it to enter the customs. Among them, 4 million jin of grain purchased by the Jidong Cooperative, 180,000 jin purchased by the Qingxian disaster area, 400,000 jin purchased by the Shengfang Cooperative, 630 tons purchased by the Tangshan Cooperative, and 240 tons of soybean cake purchased by the Dezhou Trading Company of Shandong Province will be transported into the customs within days. The first batch of 32 train cars of grain arrived in Beijing successively on the previous (30th) and yesterday (31st).
　　[Shenyang News] The transfer of grain from Northeast China to solve the grain shortage problem in North China has been resolved through consultations between the two regions. The Northeast Dongxing Company and the Third Division of the Finance and Economics Committee are actively preparing to load 75,000 tons of grain to North China in November. This year, the areas surrounding Beijing and Tianjin are short of grain due to natural disasters and need the support of grain from Northeast China. Wang Yiming, manager of the North China Grain Corporation, came to Shenyang a few days ago to discuss with the Northeast Finance and Economics Committee about increasing the amount of grain transported into the customs, which has been agreed by both parties. In addition to the 23,000 tons of grain rushed to North China by the Northeast Dongxing Company in October, another 75,000 tons of grain will be transported in November, averaging 83 cars per day, loading 2,500 tons per day. The problem of train cars has been approved by the Finance and Economics Committee. The detailed plan for the type of grain, receiving and dispatching locations, etc. has been drawn up by both parties. Among the 75,000 tons, 56 percent is corn, and the rest is sorghum and millet, each accounting for half. Most of them are sent from Heilongjiang, Songjiang and Jilin provinces. Half of the total will be handed over to Tianjin, and the rest will be allocated to Beijing, Tangshan, Shijiazhuang, Cangxian, Dexian and other places, starting on November 1st.
　　In recent days, grain companies at all levels in Northeast China have been sending grain to North China intensely. A total of 4,700 tons were transported away in the three days from the 25th to the 27th. 20,000 tons have been shipped in October, and the plan to transport 23,000 tons of grain will be completed by the 31st.
