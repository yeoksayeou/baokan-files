The committee received a report from the Suiyuan Provincial Government last night stating: A shopkeeper in Jining is seriously ill, and after a doctor's examination, it was determined to be bubonic plague, the source of which came from Shangdu; at the same time, a condition was also discovered in Datong, but it has not yet been determined to be plague.

    【北京讯】鼠疫由察北经商都蔓延至集宁，中央防疫委员会昨作紧急措置。该会于昨晚接获绥远省政府报告称：集宁商店一人，病势严重，经医生检查后确定为腺鼠疫，病源系由商都传来；同时在大同也发现病情，但尚未确定即系鼠疫。中央防疫委员会得到报告后，为防止鼠疫继续蔓延，已调遣部队封锁大同至丰镇交通，并即将派出华北人民政府防疫医疗队赴大同作深入检查工作。
