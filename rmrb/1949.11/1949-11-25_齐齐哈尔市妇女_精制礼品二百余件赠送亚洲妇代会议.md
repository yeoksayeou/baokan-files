　　Qiqihar Women
　　Present Over Two Hundred Exquisitely Made Gifts to the Asian Women's Representative Conference
    [Qiqihar Dispatch] Women from all walks of life in Qiqihar warmly support the upcoming Asian Women's Representative Conference in Beijing. The Municipal Women's Federation received 235 gifts from women of all circles for the conference and delegates from various countries in the first week of this month, including 207 particularly exquisite ones. To deepen the understanding of the Asian Women's Representative Conference among women in Qiqihar, the Municipal Women's Federation held an exhibition of the gifts on the afternoon of the 7th and the 8th. In one and a half days, over a thousand women from various agencies, organizations, factories, schools, and neighborhoods visited. After being sorted, the gifts were sent to the Heilongjiang Provincial Women's Federation on the 11th for transfer to the Asian Women's Representative Conference in Beijing.
    In making and sending gifts, women from all walks of life demonstrated their high level of joy and support for the convening of the Asian Women's Representative Conference.
    Female workers such as Yang Shuqing from the Trade Company's burlap sack factory embroidered two tablecloths in their spare time, with the words "Strive to Build a New World" embroidered on them. Female shop assistants from the First and Second Department Stores embroidered congratulatory gifts in their spare time until late at night, embroidering a flag of "International Women's Great Unity" with soybeans and sorghum from the Northeast as the background. The Second Department Store embroidered a framed picture of the map of China and the words "Building a New China." Female comrades from the Provincial Hospital made a brocade banner more than six feet long for the conference in four or five days, as well as two embroidered chair cushions. Female comrades from other departments such as the Education Union, the Municipal Government, the Railway, the Post and Telecommunications, and the Court also rushed to make gifts such as embroidered tablecloths amidst their busy work. Female students from the First Normal School collectively embroidered four small handkerchiefs, embroidered with "Dear Delegates, Eternal Health" and "Peace-loving Sisters, Eternal Unity." Female comrades from the Municipal Party Committee of the Communist Party of China embroidered four headscarves to give to foreign delegates. Female comrades from the Northeast Military Region Military and Political School made a large banner of about ten feet, with a portrait of Chairman Mao and the words "Women of All Asia, Unite and Fight Heroically to Defend World Peace!"
    Some military dependents, female workers, and railway employee family members, in order to express their love for democratic sisters from various countries, gave "old treasures" that they had saved for many years to the conference as gifts. For example, Li Xiufan, a military dependent from the Third Group of the First Police Station, specially gave a beautifully embroidered small pouch that she embroidered when she got married to the delegates; Hu Shi's pillow top, a military dependent from the Second District, was left by her old mother and has been preserved for seventy years, and is now given to the delegates as a souvenir. Liu Jingwen, a female worker from the Nenjiang Textile Factory, is twenty years old. She participated in the Northeast People's Representative Conference and played an active role in promoting production in the factory. With the upcoming Asian Women's Representative Conference, she specially gave the exquisite pillow top made by her mother as a gift.　　　　　　(Yang Shuyue)
