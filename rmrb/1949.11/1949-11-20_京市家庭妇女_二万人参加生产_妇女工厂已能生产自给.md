　　Beijing Housewives
  　20,000 Participate in Production
  　Women's Factory Now Self-Sufficient
    [Beijing News] The Beijing Women's Federation held a press conference at 2:00 PM on the 12th, where Hu Yizai, Deputy Director of the Production Department of the Women's Federation, reported on the women's production situation under the leadership of the Women's Federation since liberation. She said that in terms of restoring and developing production, the work of the Production Department of the Women's Federation has three focuses: First, taking over women's handicraft factories. This factory was originally established by the Kuomintang reactionaries to exchange for American relief supplies, fostering the bad habit of workers relying on relief. Now, through education and relying on the strength of the workers, a relief-oriented factory has been transformed into a self-sufficient factory. The main products are socks and towels. Twenty weaving machines have been added and are scheduled to start production on the 12th. Second, pilot operation of drawn-work factories. Most of the products are for export. Third, organizing women in various districts to participate in production, mainly in cotton padding work. The carpet industry, match industry, leather industry, and industries such as velvet flowers, drawn-work, and toothbrushes have also driven more than 20,000 housewives to participate in production. At the same time, she also talked about several experiences in her work since liberation, believing that the political consciousness of the masses of women can only be raised through production. She emphasized that women's production is a link in the entire society and cannot be viewed in isolation. Zhang Zhongshi, the person in charge of the drawn-work industry union, then spoke about the history, development, and future of the drawn-work industry. Geng Xiao of the Women's Federation reported on the changes in workers' thinking since liberation.

　　京市家庭妇女
  　二万人参加生产
  　妇女工厂已能生产自给
    【北京讯】北京市妇联于十二日下午二时举行记者招待会，由妇联生产部副部长胡一哉报告解放以来妇联所领导的妇女生产情况。她说，在恢复与发展生产方面，妇联生产部的工作有三个重点：一、接管妇女手工厂。该厂原系国民党反动派用以换取美国救济物资而设的，养成工人依赖救济的恶习，现经过教育，并依靠工人力量，已将一个救济性的工厂改变成了一个自给自足的工厂。现主要生产品为袜子和毛巾，开始增设织布电机二十台，可于十二日开工。二、试办挑补花工厂。出品大部外销。三、组织各区妇女参加生产，主要为铺棉工作。地毯业、火柴业、皮革业及绒花、挑补花、牙刷等业也带动了两万以上的家庭妇女参加生产。同时，她并谈到解放以来在工作中的几点体验，认为必须通过生产才能提高妇女群众的政治觉悟。她强调妇女生产是整个社会的一环，不能孤立来看。继由挑补花业工会负责人张仲实讲述挑补花业的历史、发展及前途。妇联耿晓报告解放后工人思想转变的情况。
