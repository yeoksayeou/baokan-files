Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 27th: TASS, Calcutta dispatch: The All-India Peace Conference opened in Calcutta on the afternoon of the 24th.

Prior to the opening of the conference, the preparatory committee held a press conference. The chairman of the preparatory committee, Shadia, who is also the chairman of the All-India Trade Union Congress, reported on the peace struggle waged by the democratic and progressive forces in India and the preparations for the conference. Shadia said that the task of the Peace Conference includes organizing a broad mass movement to support peace, oppose the danger of a new war, and oppose imperialist interference in the colonies. He pointed out that the main organizers of the new war and interference in the colonies are the American and British imperialists. Shadia said that the preparatory committee is in contact with more than one hundred mass organizations, uniting more than two million people. This includes more than 800,000 workers, 100,000 office workers, about 100,000 students, and 700,000 farmers and rural workers. Indian women are also actively participating in the struggle for peace.

Attending the All-India Peace Conference were 3,000 delegates from various provinces, all of whom were elected at local peace supporter conferences. There were also many guests from all over the country. Shadia was elected chairman of the All-India Peace Conference. On the rostrum of the conference hung red flags and huge portraits of Lenin, Stalin, and Mao Zedong, as well as various slogans calling for upholding peace and democracy and opposing American and British war vendors.

The conference read congratulatory messages from the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress, the World Federation of Trade Unions, the Central Council of Soviet Trade Unions, and the National Committee of the Chinese People's Congress for the Defense of World Peace.

Delegates and guests repeatedly cheered for the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. They cheered: Long live the Soviet Union—the bastion of peace and democracy in the world! Long live the beloved Stalin!

The conference also read congratulatory messages from the Indian people—fighters for peace and progress. A group of peace fighters composed of workers from the Madras aviation sector assured the All-India Peace Conference that they would never take up arms against the Soviet Union.

A woman donated five rupees from her meager savings to the peace fund. Her letter reads: "My husband is highly educated, but he is currently unemployed. I am donating five rupees to the fund for the struggle to uphold peace and wish the conference a complete success."
