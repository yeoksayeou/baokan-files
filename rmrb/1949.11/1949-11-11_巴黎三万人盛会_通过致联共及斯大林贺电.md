    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 10th: TASS, Paris: On November 8th, 30,000 Parisians went to the Paris Winter Sports Arena to participate in a rally commemorating the 32nd anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution. The presidium of the conference included members of the French Communist Party's Politburo and representatives from the General Confederation of Labor, the French Women's Union, the African Democratic Movement, and other democratic organizations. All participants passed a telegram of congratulations to the Soviet people, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and Stalin amidst cheers. Thorez and Duclos delivered speeches to the conference. Thorez said: The old and dying capitalist world has fallen into its own insoluble contradictions. A crisis is approaching, unemployment and poverty are increasing, savage suppression of working people striving for freedom and bread is intensifying, and unjust colonial wars are being waged against people striving for their own independence. The entire bourgeois society has fallen into chaos and decline; it has become thoroughly corrupt and mired in vanity and corruption. The situation in the socialist world is completely different. This world does not know the exploitation of man by man, and it is following the path of continuous and steady development of productive forces. Thorez ended his speech by cheering the great October Socialist Revolution and our dear and great Stalin. Duclos spoke after Thorez, emphasizing the achievements of the Soviet people in restoring the people's economy and further strengthening the strength of the Soviet Union.

    巴黎三万人盛会
    通过致联共及斯大林贺电
    【新华社北京十日电】塔斯社巴黎讯：十一月八日，三万巴黎市民赴巴黎冬季运动场，参加伟大十月社会主义革命三十二周年的纪念大会。大会主席团有法共政治局委员及总工会、法国妇女联盟、非洲民主运动及其他民主团体的代表。全体与会者在欢呼声中通过致苏联人民、苏联共产党及斯大林的贺电。多列士和杜克洛向大会发表演说。多列士说：古旧垂死的资本主义世界，已堕入它本身的不能解决的矛盾中。危机在临近，失业贫困在增长，对争取自由与面包的劳动人民的野蛮镇压在加强，对争取自己独立的人民的不义的殖民地战争在进行。整个资产阶级社会已堕入混乱与衰亡中，它已彻头彻尾地腐朽不堪，并已陷在虚妄和腐败之中。而社会主义世界的情景，则完全不同，这个世界中不知道人对人的剥削，它走着生产力不断稳步发展的道路。多列士在结束演说时为伟大的十月社会主义革命及亲爱的伟大的斯大林欢呼。杜克洛继多列士之后发表演说，他强调苏联人民在恢复人民经济和进一步加强苏联的力量中获得的成就。
