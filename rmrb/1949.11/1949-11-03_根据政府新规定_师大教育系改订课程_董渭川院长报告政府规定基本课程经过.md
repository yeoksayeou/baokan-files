According to New Government Regulations
　　Beijing Normal University Education Department Revises Curriculum
　　Dean Dong Weichuan Reports on the Process of Government-Mandated Basic Courses

　　[Our Dispatch] After the former North China Higher Education Committee announced the basic curriculum for university education departments, all teachers and students of the Beijing Normal University Education Department immediately launched discussions. Based on the new regulations and with reference to the school's actual situation, they formulated a complete four-year curriculum, which is now being implemented on a trial basis.

　　The new curriculum stipulated by the Higher Education Committee is vastly different from the old curriculum. Dong Weichuan, Dean of the Education College of Beijing Normal University, who participated in this revision, said in a report to the department's students: The new curriculum announced by the government represents a major step forward in the reform of the direction and content of arts and law colleges. The curriculum revision work of the Education Department was decided after a long period of organized and led research. The leader was the Higher Education Committee, and the organization was the "University Education Department Curriculum Symposium" jointly composed of the heads of the Education Departments of China University, Peking University, Yenching University, Fu Jen Catholic University, and Beijing Normal University, as well as government representatives. Starting in April of this year, the symposium was held once a week, a total of eight times. The results of the discussions were sent to the Higher Education Committee, which then invited an education group to discuss and revise them before submitting them to the Higher Education Committee for careful consideration and final announcement. Moreover, the people attending the symposium from each school brought the opinions of all the teachers and students of their respective Education Departments. Therefore, the curriculum revision fully embodied the spirit of democratic centralism. He went on to say that everyone's dissatisfaction with the old curriculum was because it was copied from foreign countries, especially mostly from the United States. It served the ruling class, was "education for education's sake," was divorced from theory and practice, had too many subjects with repetitive content, and emphasized teaching techniques while neglecting the correct direction of education. As for the basis of the revision, first, it was affirmed that education is a weapon of political struggle, and today it is even more a weapon for consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship. Starting from this premise, at the present stage, the university education department should take the task of supplying a large number of mid-level education cadres. Therefore, the interim regulations clearly define its task as cultivating knowledge and skills for mid-level education workers who serve the people, based on the New Democratic education policy and Marxist theory and methods. As for the principles of compiling the new curriculum, the symposium also stipulated five items such as the unity of theory and practice. The now-announced regulations precisely meet these principles. In addition to the three compulsory political courses, the thirteen basic subjects of the Education Department are all based on the above-mentioned tasks and principles. The major change is not only that the subjects have been greatly streamlined, but also that new political and economic subjects have replaced the old educational philosophy and history of philosophy. Since the foundation of education has changed, it is naturally no longer based on biology and psychology, especially the old and varied psychology subjects have been largely deleted. "History of Education" focuses on the "modern," and the addition of "New Democracy" to "Introduction to Education" will inevitably cause a major change in the content of this subject, and it is possible to study various practical education in groups. These are all major changes resulting from the key point that education is a political weapon. During the symposium process, there were various divergent opinions, but they still came to this unanimous conclusion.

　　The students were very excited after listening to his two-hour report. Each class discussed how to formulate a complete new curriculum based on the government's regulations, and submitted their opinions to the department affairs meeting. After more than a week of discussion, a trial draft was finally produced. This draft was entirely based on the spirit of the basic curriculum announced by the government. Its main features are: (1) grouping from the third year; (2) while engaging in professional grouping, attention is also paid to freely selecting various disciplines outside the department, so the first two years have "free electives" accounting for one-half; (3) changing the "internship" method into three types, starting from the second year with "regular internship," going to the countryside for a half-year "concentrated internship" in the seventh semester, and going to the affiliated middle and primary schools for "key internship" in the eighth semester. In recent days, the students of the department have been busy selecting new courses, unanimously hoping for success in the trial implementation under the principle of "teacher-student cooperation, mutual teaching and learning."

　　根据政府新规定
  　师大教育系改订课程
    董渭川院长报告政府规定基本课程经过
    【本报讯】前华北高等教育委员会公布了大学教育系的基本课程之后，师范大学教育系全体师生即展开讨论，根据新规定，参照该校实际情形商订了四年的全部课程，已在开始试行。
    高教会所订新课程与旧课程有绝大的不同。曾参与此项改订工作的师大教育学院院长董渭川在向该系同学报告时说：政府公布的新课程，使文、法学院在方向与内容的改革上迈了一大步，教育系课程改订的工作是经过有组织、有领导的长期研讨才决定的，领导者是高教会，组织是联合华大、北大、燕大、辅大、师大五校教育系主任以及政府代表共同组成的“大学教育系课程座谈会。”从本年四月起，每周座谈一次，先后共举行过八次座谈，把讨论的结果送给高教会，又由高教会邀请一个教育小组讨论修改，然后提交高教会全体会经仔细考虑才公布的。而各校出席座谈会的人又都是带了各校教育系全体师生的意见去的，所以，课程的改订是充分发挥了民主集中制精神的。接着他说，大家对于旧课程的不满，是因为它是从外国抄袭来的，尤其是大部分从美国贩卖来的，它是为统治阶级服务的，是“为教育而教育”的，是理论与实际脱节的，是科目繁多而内容重复的，是偏重教学技术而忽略了教育正确方向的。至于改订的根据，首先肯定教育是政治斗争的武器，在今天更是巩固人民民主专政的武器，由这个前提出发，在现阶段大学教育系应该以供给大量中级教育干部为任务，因此，在公布的暂行规定中很鲜明的确定其任务为根据新民主主义的教育方针及马克思主义的理论与方法培养为人民服务的中级教育工作者的知识与技能。至于编订新课程的原则，座谈会也曾规定了理论与实践一致等五项。现在公布的规定正好符合这些原则。除掉三门公共必修的政治课以外，教育系十三门的基本科目都是从上述的任务与原则出发的，其重大的改变是不仅科目大大的精简了，并且拿新的政治经济科目代替了旧的教育哲学及哲学史之类。教育的基础既然变更，当然不再以生物学、心理学做基础了，特别是旧日那些五花八门的心理学科目被大量删除了，“教育史”着重于“近代”的，“教育概论”之上冠以“新民主主义”也必然的使这一科的内容大翻身，并且可以分组研习各种实际的教育了，这都是由教育是政治的武器这一要点产生的重大改变。在座谈的过程中曾经有过多种纷歧的意见，但还是归落到了这个一致的结论上。
    同学听他作过两小时的报告之后，都很兴奋，各班纷纷讨论如何根据政府的规定制定一套完整的新课程，并把意见提到系务会议上，经过一个多星期的商量，终于有了一个试行的草案产生，这个草案完全是依照政府公布的基本课程的精神拟定的，其主要特点是：（一）从第三年起分组：（二）一面从事于专业的分组，一面又注意到自由选修本系以外的各种学科，所以前两年都有占到二分之一的“自由选修”；（三）把“实习”的方式变为三种，从第二年起开始作“经常实习”，第七学期到乡村去作半年的“集中实习”，第八学期到附中附小去作“重点实习”。日来该系同学正忙于选习新课，一致希望在“师生合作，教学相长”的原则下试行成功。
