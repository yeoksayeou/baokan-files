Xinhua News Agency, South China Front, 13th: The Guangdong-Zhongshan Column, which persisted in the struggle behind enemy lines in central Guangdong, joined forces with the People's Liberation Army advancing into the Xijiang River basin. Closely united, they fought side by side, eliminating more than 7,000 Kuomintang bandits retreating westward, achieving a great victory. The Guangdong-Zhongshan Column was originally a people's armed force during the Anti-Japanese War. After the end of the Anti-Japanese War, in order to strive for domestic peace, they painfully withdrew from northern central Guangdong. However, the bloody oppression of the local people by the Kuomintang bandits aroused a tide of popular resistance. Under the leadership of Lin Qiangyun, Wu Youheng, and others, they re-established their own armed forces and actively carried out armed struggle, achieving great development in 1946 alone. They united closely, relied on the masses, and led the masses to resist the Kuomintang bandits' conscription, taxation, and grain requisition. After 1947, they developed and grew even more rapidly, constantly attacking bandit township offices and local militias, eliminating many enemies, gradually driving large groups of bandits into county towns, and liberating vast rural areas. The bandit army vainly attempted to eliminate this people's armed force, and formed the so-called "Guangdong-Zhongshan Communist Suppression and Pacification Headquarters," concentrating superior forces and using tactics such as "key offensives" and "hollow offensives" to carry out four large-scale "encirclements and suppressions." All commanders and fighters of the Guangdong-Zhongshan Column, in order to defend this land of the people, launched heroic struggles against the bandit army in the mountains and ridges of Yunwu Mountain. They wore tattered clothes soaked in sweat and rain, sometimes even relying on bonfires to keep warm and wild vegetables to survive, persisting in fighting the enemy. In the Tea Mountain defense battle, the enemy attempted to "encircle and annihilate" more than 70 of them with a force of more than 600 men, but they repeatedly repelled the enemy's four attacks and won a victory. In this battle, combat hero Ou Zai single-handedly killed seven bandit soldiers. Before his heroic sacrifice, he said to his comrades: "Remember, comrades, swear to defend this clean land of ours." In the first half of 1948, the Guangdong-Zhongshan Column successively crushed dozens of large and small "encirclements and suppressions" and "sweeps" by bandit leaders such as Mo Furu. After the autumn harvest, they launched a large-scale offensive, once liberating the two county towns of Gaoming and Heshan. When the People's Liberation Army marched into Guangdong, they actively established people's power on the one hand, and launched larger-scale offensives against the enemy on the other. After the main force of the People's Liberation Army advanced into the Xijiang River, they victoriously joined forces with their brother units in the field army, fought together, annihilated more than 7,000 bandits retreating westward from Guangzhou, and liberated more than ten county towns including Gaoyao, Sanshui, Gaoming, Xinxing, and Yunfu.

    粤中纵队辉煌胜利
    坚持敌后斗争发展壮大与大军会师后歼匪七千
    【新华社华南前线十三日电】坚持粤中敌后斗争的粤中纵队与挺进西江流域的人民解放军会师后，亲密团结，并肩作战，消灭国民党西退残匪七千余人，取得了很大的胜利。粤中纵队原为抗日时期的人民武装，在抗日战争结束后，为了争取国内和平忍痛从粤中北撤。但国民党匪帮对该地人民的血腥压迫，激起人民反抗的怒潮，在林锵云、吴有恒等领导下，又重新建立起自己武装积极进行武装斗争，并在一九四六年一年中获得很大发展。他们紧密团结，依靠群众，并领导群众反抗国民党匪帮的征兵、征税、征粮。一九四七年以后，他们更迅速发展壮大，不断袭击匪乡公所和地方团队，消灭不少敌人，逐渐把大股匪徒赶进县城，解放了广大农村。匪军妄图消灭这支人民武装，曾组成了所谓“粤中剿共绥靖指挥所”，集中优势兵力，以“重点进攻”、“空心进攻”等战术进行四次大“围剿”。粤中纵队全体指战员为了保卫这块人民的土地，曾与匪军在云雾山的崇山峻岭中展开英勇的斗争。他们穿着被汗浸雨淋的破烂衣服，有时甚至依靠野火取暖和以野菜度日，坚持与敌人作战。在茶山守卫战中，敌人以六百余人的兵力妄图“围歼”他们七十余人，但他们接连击退了敌人的四次进攻，获得了胜利。在这一次的战斗中，战斗英雄欧仔一人击毙七个匪军，他在英勇牺牲之前对同志们说：“记住，同志们，誓死坚持我们这块干净的土地。”一九四八年上半年中，粤中纵队又先后粉碎了匪首莫福如等的数十次大小“围剿”和“扫荡”。在秋后他们即大举出击，一度解放了高明、鹤山两座县城。当人民解放军大军进军广东前后，他们一面积极建立人民政权，一面向敌人作更大规摸的进攻。此次解放军大军挺进西江后，他们便与野战军兄弟部队胜利会师，共同作战，歼灭了由广州西退的歼匪七千多人，解放高要、三水、高明、新兴、云浮等十余座县城。
