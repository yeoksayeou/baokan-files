The Tianjin Industrial Exhibition grandly opens today. More than 1,700 factories are participating, including approximately 8,000 industrial products. In addition, there are industrial products from Shanghai, Beijing, Tangshan, Zhangjiakou, Shijiazhuang, Yantai, Hangzhou, and other places, as well as some agricultural products brought by farmer representatives from the five provinces of North China. Such an industrial exhibition is only possible in a city belonging to the people themselves.

This industrial exhibition has eleven industrial exhibition halls. From here, one can see the overall picture of Tianjin's industrial production since liberation, and also the brilliant achievements made by the great working class in the short ten months since liberation. In the Public Utilities Hall, there are various models, charts, and photo displays from units such as tramways, buses, tap water, Xingang project, Postal Administration, Tianjin Railway Administration, Tianjin Telecommunications Bureau, North China Electric Power Company Tianjin Branch, and Tianjin Daily. What should be emphasized here is that from the three major models of the Xingang panorama, navigation locks, and docks, one can see that this largest port in northern China, located on the northern bank of Dagu Estuary in Bohai Bay, is drawing up plans and preparing to fully construct it. When completed in the future, it will play a significant role in domestic and foreign material exchanges and trade. The Chemical Industry Hall has very rich exhibits, with many charts and models illustrating the manufacturing process of acids, alkalis, salts, and soaps, as well as displays of many industrial raw materials and finished products such as caustic soda, hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, Jiuda refined salt, rubber, paper, leather, matches, and vegetable oil. Tianjin's chemical industry occupies a very important position in China. As early as thirty years ago, it laid the foundation for the basic raw materials of the chemical industry, acid and alkali production. Although it was repeatedly devastated by the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang bandit gangs in the past ten years, it has moved from recovery to development with the strong support of the People's Government since liberation. For example, in the rubber industry, most of the dozens of factories were shut down before liberation, but now 75 have resumed operations, and the products are in short supply. The exhibits in the Export Goods Hall include carpets, bristles, Chinese medicine, mountain products, vegetable oil, down feathers (chicken, duck, and goose feathers, etc.), hides and furs (various leathers and furs), agricultural products (soybeans, etc.), and others. As long as sales are well organized, these products can, to a certain extent, increase national income. Some of these items (such as chicken and duck feathers) were not valued in the past due to their limited use in the country, and were even discarded daily, which was a great loss. This industrial exhibition will also educate farmers to recognize the proper value of these items and pay attention to them. The Iron and Steel Machinery Hall features an oil painting of the operation and steel tapping of a Martin furnace, as well as diesel engines, printing presses, agricultural machinery, and other parts necessary for machinery and transportation. In the agricultural machinery section, you can see tractors, weeders, seeders, seed selectors, machine plows, water pumps, etc., which illustrate that industry is serving agriculture and symbolize the future of agricultural mechanization in New China. The exhibits in the Textile Industry Hall include cotton textiles, wool textiles, machine dyeing and finishing, weaving and dyeing, knitting, and cotton making. Particularly noteworthy here are woolen products: printed flannel, sized flannel, woolen roller flannel, and sacks. In the past, most of these were dependent on foreign imports, but now we can produce them ourselves. The Industrial Improvement Hall is specially set up to inspire and reward inventions and innovations, and to build an independent and self-reliant industry. There are exhibits from seven groups including chemical industry, cotton and wool knitting, electrical equipment, machine tools, leather making, straw weaving, and medical equipment, totaling more than 200 items. The invention and improvement of each product has reached considerable effectiveness under the creative wisdom of the working class. The Huang Yufu-style rotary steam engine was successfully developed after fifteen years of research. Coal and firewood can be used as fuel, and it can directly drive generators, and serve as the prime mover for large and small power plants, factories, large and small steamships and trains, high-rise vehicles in mines, water pumps, irrigation fields, and reclamation. The electric medicine cutter invented by Yang Mengchang can cut 7,000 catties of medicine per day, more than 200 times more than manual labor (cutting 30 catties of medicine per day). The electric incubator imitated by Zhou Yunfeng already has three types: 2,000-egg, 8,000-egg, and 16,000-egg. In view of the fact that there is no electricity equipment in rural areas at present, an incubator that does not use electricity has been researched. This is a great contribution to agricultural sideline production. The new-style plow invented by Chen Lianren can do the work of two cows with one cow, and plowing is also very easy. The improved waterwheel of Tianchang Factory is very convenient to use manpower. The corn thresher imitated by Fuchanglong Factory can thresh 1,200 catties of corn kernels per day. The invention of Wang Yunshan's jute pulp and the tested paper is strong and smooth, which has been confirmed as excellent pulp. In the future, actively establishing pulp factories will eliminate the need for foreign paper in two years. In addition, the successful trial production of printed pattern rubber plates, the successful research on motor oil, cylinder oil, and diesel oil in the oil and wax field, and the start of self-production of chemical dyes such as oil blue, oil red, oil yellow, and carbon black, and the mass production of "666" insecticides can replace foreign goods, and some have higher efficiency than foreign goods (such as "666" insecticides, which are eight times more effective than D.D.T. insecticides). All these inventions and improvements show that the new industrial forces are beginning to sprout and grow in the construction of new democracy. The Electrical Industry Hall has nine exhibits including electric motors and transformers. There are less than 100 electrical industries in Tianjin, and only 21 participated in this exhibition. From this, it can be seen that Tianjin's electrical industry, whether in terms of production scope or production capacity, is still far from the requirements, and efforts must be doubled to expand equipment, expand production, and supply types. In addition, the Metallurgy and Kiln Industry Hall includes two types of exhibits: kiln industry and mining industry, the Foreign Industry Hall includes the main industrial products of factories in various places, the Daily Necessities Industry Hall includes general daily necessities, and the Food Industry Hall includes more than ten types of exhibits such as noodles, sauces, cigarettes, and sugar. Farmers who have seen the food industry, which is closely related to their own production, can understand what agricultural products can be manufactured and how to manufacture them.

The exhibits in the above eleven halls are so rich, mainly because this industrial exhibition not only solicits representative items, but also general items, not only solicits items from large factories, but also from small and medium-sized factories. This is a broad mass exhibition. It meets the requirements of today's Tianjin's industrial and commercial recovery and development - it can not only exchange technical experience, but also promote the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas. Especially in promoting the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, the wide display of products allows farmers to make a correct evaluation based on the needs of the countryside, which has a significant effect on industrial products facing the countryside and opening up sales channels; at the same time, farmers will gain industrial production knowledge from these many exhibits, so that they can plan production of raw materials in a more planned way in the future, and adapt to the overall needs of urban industrial and urban-rural economic development.

　　工展介绍天津工业生产大检阅
    本报驻津记者  古维进
    天津工展，于今日隆重揭幕。参加工展的有一千七百余家工厂，包括约八千种工业品，此外还有上海、北京、唐山、张家口、石家庄、烟台、杭州等地的工业品及华北五省农民代表带来的部分农产品。这样的工业展览会只有在人民自己的城市才有可能。
    这次工业展览会中有十一个工业展览馆。从这里可以看出天津解放以来工业生产的全貌，也可以看见伟大的工人阶级在解放以来短短的十个月中所获得的辉煌成绩。在公用事业馆里，有电车、公共汽车、自来水、新港工程、邮政管理局、天津铁路管理局、天津电信局、华北电业公司天津分公司、天津日报等单位的各种各样的模型、图表、照片的陈列。这里应该着重提出的，就是从新港全景、航闸、船坞的三大模型里，可以看出这个位于渤海之滨大沽口北岸的中国北部第一大港，正在拟定计划，准备全力修建。将来修建完成，在对内对外的物资交流与贸易上都将起重大作用。化学工业馆的展览内容非常丰富，有许多图表与模型，说明酸、碱、盐、肥皂的制造过程，还有烧碱、盐酸、硝酸、久大盐精、橡胶、造纸、皮革、火柴、植物油等许多工业原料及成品的陈列。天津化学工业在中国占很重要地位，远在三十年前已经奠定了化学工业基本原料酸碱事业的基础，虽然近十几年间被日寇与国民党匪帮一再摧残，但解放以后经人民政府的大力支持，已由恢复进到发展阶段。比如橡胶业，解放前数十家大部停工，现在有七十五家开工，产品供不应求。出口物资馆的展览品，包括地毯、猪鬃、国药、山货、植物油、绒羽（鸡鸭鹅毛等）、皮毛（各种皮革毛类）、农产品（大豆等）及其他。这些产品，只要很好组织销售，在一定程度内也可以增加国民收入，其中有的东西（如鸡毛鸭毛等）过去因本国用途很少，日常不被重视，甚至加以抛弃，这是很大的损失。这次工展也将教育农民认识这些东西的适当价值而加以注意。钢铁机械馆有着一幅马丁炉操作及出钢情形的油画及柴油机、印刷机、农用机器和其他机器上及交通上必需的零件。在农用机器部分里，可以看到拖拉机、除草机、播种机、选种机、机器犁、水泵等，这些东西，说明工业正在为农业服务及象征着新中国农业机器化的远景。纺织工业馆的展览品包括棉纺织、毛织、机器染整、织染、针织、制棉。这里特别引人注意的是毛织品：印刷呢、浆纱呢、毛辊呢、麻袋等，这些东西，过去多半依赖外国进口，现在自己也能生产了。工业改进馆是为了启发和奖励创造发明，建设自立更生的工业而特设的。这里有化学工业、棉毛针织、电工器材、机器工具、制革、草织、医疗器材共七个组的展览品共二百余种。每一种产品的发明和改进，在工人阶级智慧创造之下，都达到相当的效能。黄玉符式的旋转蒸汽机，是经过十五年研究而成功的，煤与木柴均可作为燃料，可以直接带动发电机，及作大小发电厂、工厂、大小汽船火车、矿山的高车、水泵、灌溉田地及垦耕地之原动力。杨孟长发明的电力切药机，每日能切药七千斤，较人工（每日切药三十斤）增多二百余倍。周云峰仿造的电力孵卵机，已有二千卵型、八千卵型、一万六千卵型的三种。又鉴于现时农村尚无电力设备，研究了不使用电力的孵卵机。这对于农业副业的供献很大。陈连仁发明的新式犁，用一头牛能干两头牛的活，耕地也甚轻松。天昌工厂的改良水车，用人力非常轻便。福昌隆工厂仿造的搓玉米机，每天能搓玉米粒一千二百斤。王蕴山枳机草纸浆的发明，及试制之纸张坚固而滑润，已证实为优良之纸浆。今后积极建立纸浆工厂，二年之后，一切纸张就不必有外来的了。此外印刷花纹胶板试制的成功，油腊方面的马达油、汽缸油、柴油等研究的成功，化学染料方面的油蓝、油红、油黄、油烟、酸性蓝等开始自制，“六、六、六”杀虫剂的大量生产，都能代替外货，有的效能比外货还高（如“六、六、六”杀虫剂，较Ｄ、Ｄ、Ｔ、杀虫剂效能大八倍）。这一切发明和改进，都说明工业的新生力量，在新民主主义的建设中，已在开始萌芽和生长。电器工业馆有电动机、变压器等九种展览品。天津电器工业还不到一百家，这次参加展览的只有二十一家。由此可以看出天津电器工业不论就生产范围或就生产能力来说，距离要求还远，必须加倍努力，扩充设备，扩大产量及供应种类。此外冶矿窑业馆包括窑业矿业两类展览品，外埠工业馆包括各地工厂的主要工业产品，日用品工业馆包括一般日用品，食品工业馆包括面、酱、烟、糖等十余种展览品。农民看过和自己生产有密切联系的食品工业，可以了解农业品能够制造什么东西及如何制造。
    上述十一个馆的展览品所以如此丰富，主要是由于这次工展，不仅征求有代表性的东西，也征求一般性的东西，不仅征求大工厂的东西，也征求中小工厂的东西。这是一个广泛的群众性的展览会。它合乎今日天津工商业的恢复和发展的要求——既能交流技术经验，又能促进城乡物资交流。特别在促进城乡物资交流方面，广泛地把产品展览出来，让农民根据农村的需要，来一个正确的评价，这对于工业品面向农村，打开销路，有重大作用；同时农民将从这许多展览品中，获得工业生产知识的教育，使他们今后更能有计划地生产原料，适应城市工业和城乡经济发展的全面的需要。（附图片）
