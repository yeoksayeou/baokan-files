Six O'Clock in the Morning
		Liu Baiyu

The rainy season in the south has begun. The troops pursuing the enemy to the final provincial border have been without sleep for two days and nights. After dark today, they will have to set up camp in the rain.

Battalion Commander Shen Guiliang personally covered the wounded communication soldier with his raincoat and took him away at the end of the battle the day before yesterday. At this time, he was only draped in a green tarpaulin of a soldier's as he directed the setting up of camp. He helped the soldiers choose the terrain. He shouted loudly, resolutely opposing those lazy individuals who casually found a large tree and went to sleep. He seriously supervised the soldiers to drive stakes, pull ropes, set up tarpaulins, and dig ditches beside them. While walking, he said calmly to the first company commander: "You see, fighting in the South is really convenient. A tarpaulin and a rifle, where can't we go?" Rain flowed down his face as he spoke and laughed. The first company commander kept wiping the rain from his face: "I think, nothing beats living in a Western-style building!" He, a northerner, never seemed to get used to the rain and the mud under his feet. "What? Comrade Chen Minghe, didn't you complain about feeling cooped up in the city?!" The first company commander knew from the tone that the battalion commander was serious, so he saluted, turned around, and walked away, grumbling and stepping through the muddy sludge. Shen Guiliang stood in the rain, watching Chen Minghe's back. He knew that Chen Minghe had a bravery medal in the small pocket of his underwear, wrapped in the "Northeast Daily" that published his heroic deeds. He got red-eyed when he heard gunfire, and said his bones felt like they were about to fall apart if he didn't fight for two months. He had been wounded seven times, but "the problem lies in his thinking!" Shen Guiliang keenly grasped this point: "The problem lies in his thinking!"

After all the encampments were set up, the battalion commander inspected for a week, and finally crawled into his own "small room" made of tarpaulin. The communication soldier lit a pile of firewood to dry his clothes, and he took out a book from his satchel and started reading it by the blazing firelight. What about the tarpaulin? It was still rustling with the sound of rain. The newly transferred communication soldier didn't know the commander's temperament and complained: "You haven't slept for two days..." He suddenly laughed at himself, remembering the book, a Soviet Red Army book on field service, which he had carried with him for more than ten days. Sometimes he would read a couple of sentences, but he would stuff it into his pocket when the guns started firing. He wanted to finish reading it today, hoping to finish it before the next battle. But the communication soldier was a talkative person, he reported something that made him unhappy to the Commander:

"Battalion Commander! Originally I found you a battalion headquarters (in his opinion, this leaky tarpaulin shed was not fit to be called a headquarters), but then the division headquarters kicked us out."

"Why did they kick us out?" The battalion commander was a little surprised.

"Well, Section Chief of the Fourth Section said – the division headquarters really has no room, the division headquarters has to have office, and battalion headquarters doesn't need one!"

"Comrade, think about it, if the division headquarters doesn't receive telegrams or hang maps, how can we fight?! ... If there's one in the back, who's going to walk so far in the rain – this isn't some golden or silver house (the communication soldier laughed), comrade, don't be conservative, sometimes the battalion headquarters is in the trench, and the trench is a very good home!"

At this moment, someone was walking back and forth outside. The communication soldier poked his head out again and shouted loudly:

"Who's there?"

The dark figure stopped and asked: "Who lives here?" The communication soldier replied with a righteous tone: "The battalion commander."

Shen Guiliang jumped up, because he recognized the division commander's voice. He quickly replied: "First Battalion Headquarters," while walking out and saluting.

The division commander excitedly called him: "Ah, Comrade Shen Guiliang? The battalion headquarters is camping out?! Did we encroach on your territory? Is that not so good?"

The battalion commander's relationship with the division commander was not just that of ordinary superiors and subordinates. On the front lines of the Siping offensive in the summer of 1947, he had saved the division commander, and later the division commander had saved him. But the division commander didn't save him on the front lines, nor on the operating table, but before the final liberation of Siping in 1948. In early spring, when the weather was still cold and the snow was beginning to melt, he argued with the regimental commander on the muddy, frozen, snowy battlefield. He refused to accept the artillery that the regiment had assigned to him, feeling that it was just a burden. You had to divide your attention to take care of it. Too far back, you couldn't take care of the command; too far forward, wouldn't it be lost if the enemy launched a counterattack? The regimental commander flew into a rage, criticizing him for being "backward!" and "conservative!" He didn't say a word, squatting there like a stone and smoking. At this time, the division commander arrived. The division commander's eyes always smiled when he looked at people, as if he could see right into your heart. He was very thin, with a mouthful of black whiskers. In every battle, he would walk around the front lines alone, sometimes quickly, sometimes slowly, but he never bent over, and bullets never hit him. Sometimes a shell would come over, he would look up and listen, stop, the bomb would explode, he would pat the dust off his body, curse, and then lightly shake his hands and walk his own way. He didn't scold people who he found were not brave, he just took them with him and walked on the front lines, and later those people weren't afraid anymore. The soldiers all liked the division commander, saying that whoever could practice their battlefield movements like the division commander would be considered a master. He came, asked what was going on, and laughed. He said: "First Battalion Commander! Take the artillery, I'll go with you." Then he walked and said: "During the War of Resistance, we laid minefields and dug tunnels with the Japanese devils behind enemy lines, would you say that was hard?" "How could it not be hard?" "Back then, the troops often said, and you must have said it too: 'Damn it! It would be great to fire a volley of artillery at them,' ... Now that we have artillery, why aren't you firing a volley at them! Are you reluctant to let the enemy go?! You take off your pants and get shelled by the enemy, letting American shells kill your comrades for nothing?! You?!" He personally helped the battalion commander deploy artillery and heavy machine gun positions, divided the tasks, organized crossfire, and stipulated liaison signals. That time they successfully liberated Siping. At the end of the battle, on the Siping overpass, the battalion commander was busy collecting spoils of war when he suddenly met the division commander, who asked him bluntly: "The artillery hasn't been lost, has it?" The battalion commander saluted, his face flushed. The division commander patted him on the shoulder with a smile and said: "Comrade, the most terrible thing is ideological problems. Conservatism leads to being behind, which is dangerous! That way, you can't work well for the Party! Grind your brain! Grind it more!" The battalion commander told others that the division commander had saved him ideologically that time, raising his ideological level from the anti-Japanese guerrilla warfare period to the level of modern regular warfare. Since then, the battalion commander had been enthusiastic about learning politics, culture, and military affairs. He became the most outstanding battalion-level commander in the regiment, excelling at directing infantry-artillery coordinated operations.

Now, the division commander was so excited and happy, holding Shen Guiliang's hand and saying:

"Come on! Go and listen, it's good to listen, what is this sound!"

The battalion commander didn't know what to do, so he could only follow him, and they walked into a small house in the nearby woods.

The small house was the entire division headquarters, filled with boxes, radio stations, and medicine chests. There were ropes and wires on the ground, and it was so crowded that there was hardly any room to move. The division commander led the battalion commander to a table, where a lamp was lit. Shen Guiliang saw the political commissar, the chief of staff, and ordinary people, adults and children (probably the owners of this thatched house!). Seeing everyone listening so solemnly, he naturally slowed his steps. He heard a sound coming from the small, gray-green American radio – which the division commander called "my grain box" – the sound was very complex and loud, it was hard to tell whether it was singing or shouting, it was just like a sea churning up and down, roaring – what was this?! He looked up at the division commander, who solemnly shook his finger at him and pointed at the radio – the churning sea-like sound was like a waterfall flying through the air, constantly shaking the entire sky, the entire world. Gradually he heard clearly that it was the cheers of the people. Suddenly, from the cheers of countless people, came a loud and majestic voice: "Long live!" "Long live the comrades!" ... The political commissar clapped his hands excitedly and said: "Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao." After Chairman Mao's voice, the cheers of the sea-like crowd were even higher and more majestic, like a fan fanning the fire, making it burn even more brightly. ...

The political commissar was a person who had participated in the "Peace Mediation Group" in 1946 and engaged in political struggle. He innocently took the hand of the first battalion commander and told him: "Our New China has been announced! We have won!"

The division commander said resolutely from the side: "Political Commissar! What about those Americans in your group! Let them listen! Let them listen! What about Truman's artillery shells? Huh?"

Shen Guiliang listened, all the way until Chairman Mao announced inside the radio: "Comrades, you have worked hard, the meeting is now adjourned." Only then did he walk out of the small house.

The rain had stopped, and the sky revealed a field of stars.

He saw that the division commander was still walking back and forth. Shen Guiliang was intently listening, not knowing when the division commander came out. He knew the division commander's habits well, the division commander was thinking, so he didn't want to disturb him, and he quietly walked back. Suddenly, the division commander stopped him: "First Battalion Commander, do you know what victory is?" Shen Guiliang only knew joy at this time. Upon hearing this question, he couldn't answer it for a moment. He was just so happy, he wanted to find someone to talk to at the top of his lungs, but this was his superior, two grades above him. The division commander let him go: "Go back and grind your brain! Comrade, grind your brain on this question!" Before they could part, the chief of staff suddenly appeared at the edge of the woods and shouted: "Three-zero-five (division commander's code name)! There's a situation!" Upon hearing this, the division commander immediately turned around and quickly turned back.

Shen Guiliang returned to his tarpaulin shed, the fire had gone out, he was so happy that he couldn't close his eyes, he lay down and sat up again, ran outside, wanting to find someone, but the soldiers were all asleep, so he had to run back. He regretted that the political instructor was not here because of his injuries. He thought of the political instructor, young, chubby, with a smiling face, and he laughed. He knew that the political instructor was a very strong cadre, and strong cadres are not necessarily without shortcomings. One thing was the same as him, he used to engage in heroism, not being content to do political work, and requesting the higher-ups to transfer him to military work, writing two reports to the regimental political commissar on the first and fifteenth of every month. The regimental political commissar told him that he would no longer read his report if he received it on these days. Only later, also in the spring of 1948, did he make leaps and bounds in progress, thus influencing the battalion to become not only a combat hero battalion but also a political model battalion – why was it all in the spring of 1948? ...

He hadn't fallen asleep yet, the tarpaulin flashed green light, he opened his eyes, it turned out to be the division headquarters communication soldier outside shining a flashlight and calling him to a meeting.

The situation at the front was changing. Originally, they were prepared to cross the provincial border tomorrow, but because of the two days and nights of muddy pursuit, the division planned to let the troops recover from their fatigue so that they could fight the battle on the border (this was the last provincial border on the troop's line of advance), but on the way to the border, there was still a river blocking them, and the enemy controlled the bridge. Just now, the reconnaissance team sent back intelligence: the enemy had been moving on a large scale since dark, and it seemed that they might abandon the bridge and destroy it. Based on this situation, the division commander announced his decision: "We cannot wait for the army's instructions, immediately dispatch the nearest battalion to launch a surprise attack and seize the bridge!" The meeting ended. The division commander finally glanced at Shen Guiliang, Shen Guiliang straightened his chest, the division commander nodded, raised a tightly clenched fist, made a heavy blow, and turned to take the map of the new province from the chief of staff to look at. When Shen Guiliang was about to leave, the division commander suddenly stopped him and said:

"Strive to cross the border by six o'clock in the morning!" "Division Commander! Certainly."

Twenty minutes later, Shen Guiliang reported the news of the "establishment of the New China People's Government" to the entire battalion. There was no time to hold any celebration meetings on the front lines, and the battalion advanced on a pitch-black mountain road.

As Shen Guiliang walked, he considered his battalion – since the spring of 1948, he had developed this habit, every time he accepted a mission, he would consider the battalion from an ideological and political perspective, as if the battalion was himself. If he didn't have the determination, he couldn't defeat the opponent. The battalion was an incomparably strong battalion, but what about the battalion's mood? Were there any new problems? He believed that there were several kinds of victories, the best kind being when the thinking was consistent from top to bottom, without any regrets in this regard. This kind of victory was not only a military victory but also a political one. In this way, every battle would greatly improve the quality of the troops. He remembered that when the counter-offensive began in the Northeast, he had fought against the peasant thinking of some who didn't cherish the city and damaged it, and the battalion became a battalion with good urban discipline. What about now? Half a month ago, they had been responsible for garrisoning a city with a population of more than 100,000, but now he was going to fight against a kind of urban influence – the thinking of being afraid of camping and being afraid of hunger? No, not at all, every soldier was advancing with difficulty, for the final victory, maybe there was only one person here, but a seedling would turn into a universal idea. What was the first company commander saying? He said: "Camping is not as good as living in a Western-style building?!" What kind of thinking was this?! Hadn't the division political commissar said at the summary meeting of urban garrison work: "Comrades – it is not easy to stand firm on the proletarian stand while sitting on a sofa. We have won, we have to manage these many cities, we have to lead with proletarian thought. Victory is also a serious ideological test for each of us!" That's right, the division commander asked: "Do you know what victory is?" I should know, we are constantly advancing, and new problems will emerge at the same time as we advance. We will definitely overcome them and then advance.

After considering this, he walked to the first company commander. He called out, "Old Chen!" He saw the first company commander Chen Minghe carrying four or five guns on his shoulders in the darkness, which was his frequent expression of caring for and helping the physically weak soldiers.

Chen Minghe answered, "Hmm, battalion commander."

"You're carrying too much weight, I still need you to command the battle later, give me one or two! Today is today!"

"Yes, today...is today, Chairman Mao took the lead in establishing our people's country, so I will carry a few more guns. Battalion Commander! If I could carry it, I would carry the artillery too, damn it! Let the artillery shells fly out of my hands, boom - boom, I'll take this as a souvenir. Battalion Commander! Do you remember - the first time we retreated from Siping, that was..." "That was in 1946, the higher-ups told us to retreat from our trenches, and you shed tears!" "Yes, - revolutionary soldiers shed blood but not tears, that time I shed tears, Battalion Commander! But they weren't shed in vain." "We won't shed them in vain, Old Chen! I misunderstood you a little bit today!" "I know, I said a sentence that you weren't satisfied with." "It's not that I wasn't satisfied, it's an ideological problem." "Battalion Commander! Western-style buildings are better than camping, don't you think that's the truth? But I've never had a Western-style building, not even a pigsty, - if Siping hadn't been destroyed, then?...Right, in 1946, I said in the trenches: 'This time, damn it! Guard it, ours, can't give it to the enemy, the houses were built one by one.' But later when it was our turn to fight for Siping, I didn't think like that...Do you remember what that old worker at the Huaihe Bridge said?" "Oh, you're talking about that old worker!"

The battalion commander recalled that during the campaign along the Pinghan Road on the way south, they had attacked the Huaihe River, and the Huaihe Iron Bridge had exploded, with the flames filling the sky.

He rushed to the riverbank, where the black smoke was like a stove fire turned upside down. The enemy had fled, there was no one there. He suddenly saw an old man on the riverbank, standing still, staring at the destroyed bridge, with tears of sorrow in his eyes. The battalion commander, the first company commander, the second company commander, the political instructor, and the soldiers talked to him. The old man was the foreman of the Changtaiguan workshop of the Xinyang Engineering Section of the Pinghan Railway Bureau. He had been a road worker since the Pinghan Railway existed, and he had protected and repaired the bridge day and night. There was only one time he wanted to blow it up himself - that was when Japanese imperialism occupied it, but he couldn't bring himself to do it, so he buried the tools and fled. Now the battalion commander shook his hand, and the old worker's tears flowed out. The battalion commander felt sad and blushed, thinking in his heart: "Cry with me, you should cry with me." He said, "Old worker comrade, - we were late!" Guess what the old worker did? He wiped the teardrops from his chin with one finger, shook his head and said, "No, no." ...The battalion commander thought of this, he looked at the first company commander.

The first company commander said: "What did he say? He said – 'You remember this debt for me!' We must settle it, Battalion Commander! We must settle it!"

His voice was very excited, alarming the soldiers behind him. He suddenly pleaded: "Battalion Commander, today – we won't be late, give me this bridge, Battalion Commander!"

The battalion commander slowly, deeply (from that brain that surfaced the countless destroyed houses, the people killed, that he had seen on the road of advance), said: "Comrade Chen Minghe - don't we remember such debts? From the Songhua River to the Pearl River."

Suddenly someone grabbed his shoulder, he turned his head, that person "chuckled" with laughter, the battalion commander shouted, "Ah, Old Li! Old Li!" and hugged the political instructor tightly. The political instructor happily said, "Let go! Let go! - Comrade, the wound is reopened because of you."

The battalion commander let him go and then asked, "How did you get here? - You're really a treasure, Old Li! You know what? Today..."

"I know, the division commander just told me, let us remember today. Old Shen, it was not easy for me to catch up with you, damn it! You can't get rid of me, comrades!"

The battalion commander was extremely happy, he thought in the darkness with a smile:

"Do I still have to criticize the first company commander? Comrades! That's how we are, we endure hardship, we sacrifice, we occasionally have problems, but we always subordinate personal interests to revolutionary interests..."

At this moment, the political instructor and the first company commander who were walking at the very front exclaimed at the same time. Only then did the battalion commander wake up from his reverie. In an instant, he saw a raging fire burning in the pitch-black darkness ahead...

The battalion commander turned around and shouted, "The enemy is burning the bridge! The first company, charge up! Seize the bridge! Seize the bridge!"

They were on a mountain, and in front of them was a river, with the fire shining brightly, and the trees sparkling in the rain. Chen Minghe took out his red command flag, waved it, and jumped into the thickets of thorns on the hillside. The soldiers followed him, regardless of everything, and rushed down from the rocky cliffs, the trees, and the thorns. On this high and steep rocky mountain, their feet could not stop and could not stop. Their feet became wings, like a group of handsome eagles, like the wind, rushing down from the mountain. The flames on the bridge were fluttering with the wind, and the river was a black and heavy mass, only illuminated by the crimson flames, showing the sinister raging waves. Raindrops were piercing the soldiers' eyes, but their eyes didn't even close, staring straight at the bridge, running straight toward the bridge, the bridge was burning, the bridge was burning.

The battalion commander rushed to the riverbank with the first company.

He saw that the bridge was burning, but it had only just started burning, and the bridge structure had not collapsed. He stared with both eyes, shouting and running, he felt the fire burning him, burning his chest.

Suddenly he saw the first company commander, holding the red flag waving in the wind in one hand, without stopping, just like a horse rushing straight to the finish line in a race, rushing straight onto the bridge, onto the bridge, he still hadn't stopped. Gunshots cracked, cracked and rang. The battalion commander immediately snatched a light machine gun from the shoulder of a soldier beside him. He ran a few steps skillfully, pounced on the riverbank, and immediately shot at the opposite bank to cover the soldiers seizing the bridge. Immediately, he discovered that sparks were spraying beside him, another machine gun was firing alongside him. The battalion commander was firing while lifting his head - the first company commander was nowhere to be seen, only the black shadows of the soldiers, courageously charging into the flames non-stop. Bullets were flying in the air with a hissing sound. He saw - in the firelight, a figure swayed and fell from the bridge...He saw the surging waves reddened by the firelight, swallowing that comrade in an instant. He gritted his teeth and fired rapidly...

Soon, the gunshots stopped, and the soldiers were putting out the flames on the bridge.

The battalion commander climbed up, it turned out that his whole body had just been crawling in a pool of cement. He was covered in dripping cement, smiling - he couldn't help but laugh from his chest. At this time, he met the political instructor, who turned out to be the one who had been firing that machine gun tightly beside him. The two smiled at each other and walked onto the bridge.

The embers on the bridge had not been extinguished, and some extinguished wood was emitting white smoke like black charcoal. The river below the bridge was not wide, but the water was flowing very fast. The battalion commander strode across the bridge, suddenly stopping in the center of the bridge, lowering his head, he saw that the gradually darkening river water under the faint firelight was still faintly reflecting the light. He couldn't express that kind of sadness, he didn't know who it was, but he thought in his heart: "Comrade! You sacrificed yourself today, today!"

The political instructor suddenly took a small iron cylinder from the gun barrel of a small soldier coming from behind, took out a slogan writing pen from it, and bent over with his injured waist, he was very focused and concentrated, writing a line of large characters on the bridge pillar: "October 1st, First Company of the First Battalion of ×× Division rescued this bridge." At this time, dawn had broken, and the dawn illuminated half of the burned bridge. The battalion commander was reorganizing the assault force when he saw the first company commander, he asked: "What happened to your eyebrows?!" The company commander touched them, swearing coarsely, the fire also burned his cheeks, at this time he felt both pain and pleasure in his heart.

The battalion commander did not allow the troops to stop, and immediately led them to advance rapidly towards the provincial border.

In the dawn, without even taking a look, he strode over the enemy's corpses and walked forward. After the sun came out, they pursued the enemy and went up a ridge with dense bamboo forests and small horsetail pines. Through the trees, there was the morning glow.

Suddenly, there was the tight sound of galloping hooves, like snowflakes, coming from behind.

The battalion commander walked up the ridge and stopped, he looked around happily, the air in the southern morning was so incomparably fresh. In the distance, patches of rice paddies were being blown by the soft breeze, and the rising sun was as lovely as melting flames, with the light of dew on the leaves.

The galloping horse stopped. The division commander jumped down from it, not panting at all, and walked step by step towards the battalion commander. The battalion commander turned around in surprise and saluted him. The division commander pointed to the ground under his feet and said: "Comrade Shen Guiliang! Tell the soldiers, this is the provincial border, the last provincial border!"

The battalion commander's two eyes shone with child-like joy, and he shouted loudly:

"Division Commander, we have successfully completed our mission."

The division commander frowned and looked around in silence. Sixteen or seventeen years ago, as a young communist league member, he had fought guerrillas in this area. His home was not far away. He looked, then he lowered his head and looked at his watch, muttering to himself: "Victory, - six o'clock in the morning, - yes! Victory is six o'clock in the morning." He raised his head and ordered the battalion commander: "We must not stop, continue to advance!"

    早晨六点钟
    刘白羽
    南方的雨季开始了，向最后一条省界追击敌人的部队，已经两日夜没有睡眼，今天天黑以后只有在雨地里安置露营。
    营长沈贵良在前天战斗结束时，亲手把雨衣盖在负伤的通讯员身上带走了，这时他只披了一块战士的绿色油布，在指挥设营。他帮战士们选择地形，他大声嚷叫，坚决反对个别偷懒的，随便找棵大树就睡觉的人，他严肃的督促战士们钉桩子、拉绳子、搭油布、在旁边掘水沟。他一边走一边安然的跟第一连连长说：“你瞧，南方作战，这一点真方便，一块油布一杆枪，那里不能去？”雨水在他脸上流，他一边说一边笑。第一连连长却不断揩抹脸上的雨水：“我看，怎么的也没住洋楼好！”他，这一个北方人似乎永不习惯这一身雨水，两脚乌泥的日子。“怎么？陈鸣和同志，在城里住你不是喊叫蹩闷吗？！”第一连连长从声调里知道营长认真起来了，他就敬个礼、转身、唧咕唧咕踏着烂泥浆走了。沈贵良站在雨地里望着陈鸣和背影，——他知道，陈鸣和内衣小口袋里装有一块勇敢奖章，还是用登载他英雄事迹的“东北日报”包的，他听见枪响就眼红，两个月不打仗就说骨头闲得快拆架了，浑身上下挂过七次彩，可是“问题在思想！”沈贵良敏锐的抓住了这一点：“问题在思想！”
    全部宿营后，营长巡视了一周，最后钻进了他自己那间油布搭的“小房”。通讯员烧起一堆柴火给他烘衣裳，他就从挂包里抽出一本书，借着熊熊的火光看起来。油布上呢？还刷刷响着雨声。新调来的通讯员不摸首长脾气，吵着：“你两天没睡觉了，……”他自己忽然就笑啦，他想起这本书，这本苏联红军关于战地勤务的书，带在身边十几天了，有时候看两句，枪一响就把他塞进口袋。他想今天一定看完了它，他希望看完了它再打仗。这个通讯员却是个爱说话的人，他报告一件他不高兴的事给首长听：
    “营长！本来我给你找到个营部（按他的意思这四角漏风的油布棚算什么营部），后来师部把我们撵出来了。”
    “为什么撵？”营长有点惊疑。
    “咳，四科长说——师部实在没有房子，师部办公，营部不办公嘛！”
    “同志，你想想，师部要不收电报，不挂地图，这仗怎么打？！……后边有，谁顶着雨多走这老远，——你这又不是什么金房子银房子（通讯员笑了），同志，不要保守，营部有的时候在战壕里，战壕也是很好的家啊！”
    这时候，有一个人在外面唧咕——唧咕的走过去又走过来。通讯员又多事的探出脑袋去猛喊了一声：
    “那一个？”
    那个黑人影子停着问：“谁住这里？”通讯员理直气壮的回答：“营首长。”
    沈贵良却一咕噜爬起来，因为他听出那是师长的声音，他赶紧一面答话：“第一营营部。”一面走出去敬礼。
    师长很兴奋的叫他：“啊，——沈贵良同志吗？营部露营了？！我们侵占了你的地盘是不是？这不大好是不是？”
    营长跟师长不是一般上下级关系，一九四七夏季四平攻坚战的火线上他救过师长，后来师长又救过他。不过师长救他不是在火线上，也不是在手术台上，而是一九四八最后一次解放四平进攻之前。初春乍暖，雪开始溶化了，他在泥泞冻雪的阵地上跟团长争论，他拒绝接受团配署给他的炮兵，他觉得那不是给他背一个大包袱吗？你还得分心照顾他，太靠后了，顾不上指挥，太靠前了，敌人来一个反击不会失落吗？团长暴跳如雷，批评他“落后！”“保守！”他一声不哼，石头一样蹲在那里抽烟。这个时候，师长来了。师长看人的时候眼睛总是笑着的，就好像一直看到你心里一样，他很瘦，一嘴黑胡髭，每一次作战，他都一个人在前线上到处走走，有时走得很快，有时走得很慢，可是他永远不弯腰，子弹也打不着他，有时一颗炮弹打过来了，他仰头听一听，停下来，炸弹炸了，他打打身上的尘土，骂一声，又轻快的摇着两手走他自己的了。他发现不勇敢的人，一点也不责骂，他就带着他在前线上走，后来那人就不怕了。战士们都欢喜师长，说谁要把战场动作练得象师长那样，才算到家了呢。他来了，问清怎么回事，他笑了，他说：“一营长！带上炮，我跟你去。”然后他一面走一面说：“抗战的时候，咱们在敌后跟鬼子摆地雷阵、搞地道战，你说苦不苦？”“怎不苦”“那时候部队上常说，你一定也说过：妈的！要有炮撂他一排子多好，……现在有炮了，你为什么不撂他一排子呀！你舍不得敌人吗？！你脱了裤子挨敌人炮打，让美国炮弹白白把你的同志打死吗？！你？！”他就亲手帮助营长布署了炮和重机枪阵地，区分了任务，组织了火力交叉，规定了联络信号。那次胜利解决了四平，战斗结束的时候，在四平天桥上，营长忙着收集战利品，一下逢见师长，他劈头就问：“炮没丢吧？”营长敬礼，满面飞红。师长笑嘻嘻拍拍他肩膀说：“同志，最可怕的是思想问题，保守就要落伍，危险呀！那样就不能很好为党工作呀！—磨磨脑子呀！多磨磨脑子呀！”营长对别人说，那一回师长从思想上救了他，把他停留在抗日游击战争时期的思想水平，提高到现在正规战争的水平来了。从那以后，营长热心学习政治、文化和军事了，他成为团里最杰出的营级指挥员，他擅长指挥步炮协同作战。
    现在，师长这样兴奋、快乐，拉了沈贵良的手说：
    “走！你去听一听，听一下也好啊，这是什么声音！”
    营长不知做什么，只有跟他走，一走就走进旁边一片树林里的小屋。
    小屋就是整个师部，箱子、电台和药箱子，地下还有绳子、电线，挤满人，简直无法插脚了。师长带营长走到桌前；那里点着灯，沈贵良看见政治委员，参谋长，还有老百姓大人和小孩子（大概是这草房的主人吧！）他看看每个人都那样庄严静听，他自然而然的就放轻了脚步。他听见从那个小小的灰绿色美国收音机，——师长管它叫“我的粮食箱子”，——发出声音，声音很复杂、很嘹亮，分不清是唱还是叫喊，只是象一片大海在翻腾上下轰轰的叫啸，——这是什么？！他举眼看师长，师长严肃的对他摇摇手指，又指一指收音机，——那翻腾大海似的声音简直象悬空飞来的瀑布，不停的震动整个天空，整个世界。渐渐他听清这是人民的欢呼，突然从这无数万人欢呼中发出一声宏亮而雄壮的呼声：“万岁！”“同志们万岁！”……政委紧张的拍着手说：“毛主席，毛主席，”在毛主席的呼声之后，那海一样的人群的欢呼更高、更雄壮，如同风扇了火，火烧得更旺盛了。……
    政委是一九四六年参加“和平调处小组”作过政治斗争的人，他天真的拉着第一营营的手告诉他：“我们的新中国宣布成立了！我们胜利了！”
    师长从旁坚毅的说：“政治委员！你那些什么小组的美国人呢！让他们听一听吧！让他们听一听吧！……杜鲁门牌的炮弹呢？啊？……”
    沈贵良听着，一直听到收音机里面，毛主席宣布：“同志们，你们辛苦了，现在散会了。”他才走出小屋。
    雨已停止，天空露出一片繁星。
    他看见师长还在唧咕唧咕的走来走去，沈贵良一心一意的在听，不知师长什么时候出来了。他熟知师长的习惯，师长在想心思，不便打搅，他就悄悄往回走。忽然师长止着他：“一营长，你知道什么是胜利？”沈贵良这时只知道快乐，这一问，他一时倒回答不出。他只是那样高兴，很想找个人放开嗓子讲一阵，可是这是他的上级，差两级的上级。师长却放了他：“你回去，磨磨脑子呀！这个问题，同志，磨磨脑子呀！”他们还未分手，忽然参谋长出现在树林边边上喊：“三○五（师长代号）！有情况！”师长一听，立刻转身就急速的抛开他转回去了。
    沈贵良回到自己油布棚里，火熄灭了，他乐得合不上眼，躺下又坐起来，跑出去，想找个人，战士们可是都睡着了，他只得跑了回来。他很可惜教导员负伤不在这里，他想起教导员年青，胖胖的，微笑的面孔，他就笑了。他知道教导员是个很强的干部，强的干部不见得没缺点。有一点跟他一样，从前闹英雄主义，不安心做政治工作，要求上级调军事工作，每月一号十五号写两次报告给团政委，团政委告诉他以后这一天收到他的报告就不看。只有后来，也是一九四八年春天，他飞跃进步了，因此影响营不但是一个战斗英雄营，也是一个政治模范营了，——为什么都是一九四八年春天呢？……
    他还没睡着，油布闪亮了绿光，他睁开眼，原来是师部通讯员在外面打着手电筒叫他去开会。
    前线情况在变化。本来准备明天穿过省界，因为两日夜泥泞追击，师打算让部队恢复一下疲劳，好进行边界上的一战（这是部队前进方向上最后一条省界了），可是在到边界的路上还横着一道河，敌人控制着桥梁。刚才侦察队送来情报：敌人从天黑以后在大规模移动，看情形有放弃桥，破坏桥的可能。师长根据这一情况宣布他的决心：“不能等待军的指示，立刻抽调身边这一个营，突击抢桥！”会议就结束了。师长最后面对沈贵良看了一眼，沈贵良挺了挺胸脯，师长点点头，举起一支捏得很紧的拳头，做了一个重重打击的手式，就转过身从参谋长手里接过新省份的地图去看了。沈贵良要走的时候，师长忽然又止着他说：
    “争取早晨六点钟过界！”“师长！一定。”
    二十分钟以后，沈贵良把“成立新中国人民政府”的消息报告全营，火线上是来不及举行什么庆祝会的，营在漆黑无比的山路上前进了。
    沈贵良一面走一面考虑他这个营，——自从一九四八年春天以后，他已经养成这样一种习惯，他每次接受任务后，都从思想上、政治上来考虑营，就象营就是他自己一个人一样，他要没决心就打不过对手，营是坚强无比的营，不过营的情绪怎样？有什么新问题吗？……他认为胜仗有几种，最好的一种是上下思想一致，从开始到结尾，这方面一点缺憾没有，这种胜仗，不单纯是军事上也是政治上的胜利，这样每打一仗就会大大提高部队的质量。他记得在东北开始反攻时，他曾经和某些不爱护城市、破坏城市的农民思想作斗争，营成为城市纪律良好的营，现在呢？他们在半个月以前曾经担任卫戍一个十余万人口的城市，他现在却要和一种城市影响，——怕露营、怕饥饿的思想作斗争吗？不，没有，每个战士都在艰苦前进，为了最后胜利，也许这里只有一个人，但一种萌牙就会变成一种普遍思想。第一连连长他说什么呢？——他说：“露营没有住洋楼好？！”这是什么思想呢？！师政治委员在总结城市卫戍工作会议上不是说过：“同志们——坐在沙发上站稳无产阶级立场，是不简单的事。我们胜利了，我们要管理这许多城市，是要用无产阶级思想去领导，胜利，对于我们每一个人也是严重的思想考验呀！”对，师长问：“你知道什么是胜利？”我应该知道，我们不断前进，前进一步同时也会出现新问题，我们一定就克服它再前进。
    他这样考虑以后，他就走到第一连连长那里去。他叫了声：“老陈！”他从黑暗中看见第一连连长陈鸣和肩膀上背了足足有四五支枪，这是他经常关心战士，帮助体力弱的战士的表现。
    陈鸣和答应着：“嗯，营长。”
    “你背的太重了，回头还要你指挥作战呢，给我一两支！今天可是今天呀！”
    “对，今天……是今天，毛主席带头建立了咱人民国家，我就更要多扛几支枪。营长！要是背得动，我还把炮也背上，他妈的！让炮弹从我手里揍出去，轰——轰，我拿这做个纪念。营长！你还记得——咱们头一抹撤退四平，那是……”“那是一九四六年，上级叫咱们从咱们战壕里撤退，你流了泪！”“对，——革命军人流血不流泪，那回我流了泪，营长！可没白流。”“我们不会白流，老陈！我今天有一点误会你！”“我知道，我说了一句话你不满意。”“不是我不满意，是思想问题。”“营长！洋楼比露营好，你说这不是真话？可是我从来没有洋楼，连一间猪窝也没有，——四平不坏，那是？……对，一九四六年，我在战壕里说：‘这回，妈的！守着它，咱们的哪，不能给敌人，那房是一间一间盖的。’可是后来轮到咱们打四平，我不这样想，……你记不记得，淮河大桥那老工人说什么来的？”“噢，你说那老工人呀！”
    营长想起南下途中顺平汉路作战，他们攻过淮河，淮河大铁桥爆炸了，火光满天。
    他抢到河边，黑烟跟搅翻了灶火底一样，敌人逃走了，没有人，他在河边上突然看见一个老头，那老头站着不动，眼望着毁坏了的大桥，眼里含着两泡悲伤的泪水。营长，第一连连长，第二连连长，教导员和战士们跟他谈话。老头是平汉路局信阳工务段长台关工棚子的棚头，从有平汉路他就当路工，他日日夜夜保护，修理大桥，只有一次他想亲手炸毁它，——那是日本帝国主义占领的时候，可是下不了手，他就埋藏了工具逃走了。现在营长拉他的手，老工人眼泪流出来了。营长难过的红着脸，心里想：“你跟我哭吧，你应该跟我哭。”嘴上就说：“老工友同志，——是我们来迟了！”你猜那老工人怎么样呢？他一只手指把下巴上的泪珠用力抹去，他摇摇头说：“不是，不是。”……营长想到这里，他看了看第一连连长。
    第一连连长说：“他说什么？他说——‘你们给我记着这笔帐！’要算，营长！要算！”
    他的声音很激动，惊动了他身后面的战士们。他忽然恳求：“营长，今天——咱们不会迟了，这座桥你给我，营长！”
    营长缓慢的，深沉的（从那脑海里浮现他前进路上所看见的无数被烧毁的房屋，被杀死的人，……），他说：“陈鸣和同志——这样的帐咱们记得少吗？从松花江到珠江。”
    突然一个人抓住他的肩膀，他回过头，那人“吓哧”笑了，营长猛叫了一声：“啊，老李！老李！”就紧紧抱着了教导员。教导员快乐的说：“放开！放开！——同志，伤口又给你挤炸哪。”
    营长放开他然后问：“你怎么来的？——你真是个宝气，老李！你知道吧！今天……”
    “我知道了，师长刚才告诉我，让我们记着今天。老沈，我真不容易赶上你们，他妈的！你们甩不下我，同志！”
    营长高兴极了，他在黑暗中笑着想：
    “我还要批评第一连连长吗？同志！我们就是这样，我们吃苦，我们牺牲，我们偶然也闹问题，可是我们永远个人利益服从革命利益，……”
    这时，走在最前面的教导员，第一连连长同时惊叫了一声。营长才从沉思中醒来，一下，他看见前面一片漆黑中有一处熊熊的火光正在燃烧，……
    营长扭转身猛叫起来：“敌人在烧桥啊！第一连冲上去呀！抢桥呀！
  抢桥呀！”
    他们在山上，前面是大河，火发亮，树木在雨中闪光。陈鸣和掏出他的红色指挥旗，举起一摆，他就跳进山坡的荆棘丛中去了。战士们跟在他后面，都不顾一切，就从石岩上，树林中，荆棘里，刺刺的冲了下去。在这段又高又陡的山岩上，他们的两脚不能停止，也无法停止，脚变成了翅膀，象一群英俊的雄鹰，象风一样，从山上飞冲了下去。桥上的火焰随风飘卷，河水是一片黑沉沉，只在血红火光中照出险恶的怒涛。雨点迎面刺着战士们的眼珠，可是他们的眼睛连闭也不闭一下，直视着那桥，直奔向那桥，桥在燃烧，桥在燃烧。
    营长跟第一连一道冲到河岸上。
    他看见桥在燃烧，可是刚刚烧起，桥架没有崩塌。他瞪着两只眼珠子，喊叫着、奔跑着，他觉得火在烧他自己，烧他的胸膛。
    忽然他看见了第一连连长，一手举着波波飘动的红旗，连停也不停，就像一匹竞赛中直奔终点的骏马，一直冲上桥，上了桥，他还没有停。枪声啪啪、啪啪的响起来了。营长立刻从身旁一个战士肩上一把把轻机枪抢过来，他熟练的跑了几步，扑在河岸，立刻向对岸射击，掩护战士们抢桥，立刻他发现身旁刺刺喷射着火花，另挺机枪跟他并肩射击了。营长一面射击一面抬起头，——第一连连长不知那里去了，只见战士们一只一只黑影，一刻不停勇敢的冲进火焰中去了。子弹在空中嗤嗤的飞。他看见——火光中，有一个人影一歪，从桥上落下去，……他看见火光照红的涌涛骇浪，一下把那个同志吞没了。他咬着牙急速发射，……
    不久，枪声停息了，战士们在扑灭桥梁上的火焰了。
    营长爬起来，原来他整个身子刚才爬在一滩水泥里，他就带着这身淋漓的水泥，笑着，——他忍不住从胸中发出的笑声。这时，他逢见教导员，原来教导员就是刚才在他紧身边抱着那一挺机枪发射的，两人相对笑了一下，走上桥。
    桥上余火未熄，有些熄了的木头象黑炭一样冒着白色浓烟。桥下面河并不宽，不过水哗哗的流得很急。营长从桥上大踏步走过，突然在桥中心停着，低下头，他看见微弱火光下逐渐发黑的河水还最后闪映着一闪一闪的亮光。他心里说不出那样的悲伤，他不知那是谁，不过他心里想：“同志！你牺牲在今天，今天！”
    教导员忽然从后面来的一个小战士枪杆上，拿下一只小铁筒，他从里面取出一支写标语的笔，他湾着受过伤的腰干子，非常聚精会神，专心一致的，在桥柱上写下一行大字：“十月一日×××师第一营第一连抢救此桥”，这时天已黎明，曙光照亮一半烧黑了的桥。营长在整理突击部队的组织，他才看见第一连连长，他问：“怎么你的眉毛呢？！”连长摸了摸，粗野的骂着，火还烧伤了他的两颊，这时他心中一方面是疼痛，一方面是愉快。
    营长不准部队停止，立刻领导向省界突进。
    他在黎明中，连看也没看一眼，就大踏步从敌人的尸体上跨过去，向前走。太阳出来以后，他们追击敌人，上了一条山岗，这山岗有密密竹林和小马尾松，透过树，有朝霞。
    突然有雪片般紧响的啪啪，啪啪的马蹄声从后面传来。
    营长走上山岗停下来，他向四周欢欣的展望，南方早晨的空气那样无比的清新。远近一片片稻田，给柔软的微风吹荡，初升的太阳象火焰一样熔熔可爱，树叶上闪着露水珠儿的亮光。
    那急奔的马停止了。师长从上面跳下来，一点也不吁喘，一步步走向营长面前。营长惊讶的转过身对他敬礼。师长指着自己脚底下说：“沈贵良同志！告诉战士，这就是省界，最后一个省界！”
    营长惊喜的两恨闪着孩子一样的喜悦，大声嚷叫：
    “师长，我们胜利完成任务。”
    师长皱着眉，沉默的望望四周。他在十六七年前，当作一个少共团员，在这一带打过游击，他的家就在前边不远的地方。他望着，然后他低下头看看手表，自语着：“胜利，——早晨六点钟，——是啊！胜利是早晨六点钟。”他扬头命令营长：“我们不要停止，继续前进呀！”
