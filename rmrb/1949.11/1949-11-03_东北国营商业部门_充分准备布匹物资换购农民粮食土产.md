　　Northeast State-owned Commercial Departments
  　Fully Prepared with Cloth and Materials to Exchange for Farmers' Grain and Local Products
    [This Newspaper reports] Shenyang, October 30th news: Since October, the state-owned commercial departments in Northeast China have completed the preparations for purchasing grain and local products this winter, and have begun the fourth year of the intense commercial season. The grain and local product companies at all levels under the Commercial Department will purchase a large amount of surplus grain, special crops, by-products, and industrial raw materials from farmers from this autumn to next spring. At the same time, department stores and fuel companies at all levels will also promote a large amount of cotton yarn, cloth, daily necessities, and coal needed by urban and rural people. In the past two months, under the leadership of the Commercial Department, state-owned stores at all levels have actively prepared various goods and funds for purchasing grain and local products. The preparation has been more sufficient and timely than in previous years, and it meets the new requirements of the people's living standards, which have been gradually improving. For example, cloth is the most important material needed for purchasing grain and local products every year. Two months ago, the commercial departments assigned special personnel to Shanghai, Tianjin, Qingdao, Dalian, and other places to raise funds for exchanging cloth. In particular, the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government allocated 800,000 bolts of various types of cloth from Tianjin and Shanghai to Northeast China, and most of them have now been transported to Northeast China. At the same time, the General Merchandise Company has also ordered 500,000 bolts of grey cloth from the Northeast Textile Administration Bureau, and public and private textile factories have added 100,000 bolts of woven and dyed cloth. At present, more than 700,000 bolts of cloth transported from other places and self-raised in Northeast China have been allocated to the Northeast General Merchandise Company. When distributing the cloth for purchasing grain, the company adheres to the principle of "first North Manchuria, then South Manchuria, first rural areas, then cities" to ensure that the cloth for promotion directly reaches the hands of consumer farmers. In addition, 160,000 bolts of fine-colored cloth have been allocated to the Dongxing Company, which will directly transport them to the grain-purchasing areas and hand them over to farmers in exchange for grain. In terms of disbursement methods, the Northeast General Merchandise Company directly transfers and consigns most of the cloth transported from other places to the grain-purchasing areas after it arrives in Shenyang, which reduces the time for inventorying in and out of the warehouse by an average of ten days compared with previous years. At present, the 700,000 bolts of cloth already received, together with the 200,000 bolts of cloth originally stored in various places in mid-September, can be used to purchase 400,000 tons of grain after being sold. The remaining large amount of cloth transported from other places and self-raised will be allocated one after another. In order to meet the needs of urban and rural people for daily necessities in winter, the Northeast General Merchandise Company and provincial branch companies have also purchased a large number of miscellaneous industrial materials from state-owned, public-private joint ventures, and private factories, and have ordered a large number of miscellaneous industrial materials from Shanghai for processing. There are daily-use towels, socks, wool socks,绒衣, toothpaste, enamel products, bed sheets, cotton shoes, rural ＠＠, kerosene, and industrial calcium carbide, hydrochloric acid, sulfurized blue, etc., worth several hundred billion yuan. At the same time, the fuel company also prepared more than 4.22 million tons of coal for heating, industrial, and railway use. The above-mentioned materials, together with the goods stored in local department stores and the main materials and funds planned by the Commercial Department, are sufficient for purchasing grain and local products this winter.
