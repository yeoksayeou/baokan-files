  　The Object and Tasks of Political Economy Studies and its Characteristics

    But regardless of the distribution of the means of production, the distribution of labor, and the distribution of products, production remains fundamental and plays a dominant role in the relationship between production and distribution.  Because the distribution of the means of production and the distribution of labor, although "precede production and are the prerequisites for production," are ultimately for production or belong to production.  As for the distribution of products, it is the result of production and is completely dependent on production. At the same time, we cannot ignore that with changes in distribution, production also changes.  For example, the distribution of the means of production and labor is "decisive for production" and the amount and quality of its allocation will affect the size and progress of production.  The distribution of products, and the amount and quality of their distribution, can affect people's lives and the ability to reproduce labor.

　　Critique of the Classical School's View on the Relationship between Production and Distribution
    Classical bourgeois political economists such as Adam Smith and Ricardo believed that economic laws are natural laws, permanently unchangeable.  Later, John Stuart Mill believed that the laws of production are immutable, while the laws of distribution are changeable.
    Adam Smith and Ricardo's views on economic laws reflect the interests of the bourgeoisie from the standpoint of the bourgeoisie.  They regard capitalist society as a fixed and permanent society, and therefore regard the capitalist economy and the capitalist economic laws as equally fixed and immutable economy and economic laws.  Marx criticized John Stuart Mill's view as "lifeless eclecticism" (Postscript to the Second Edition of *Capital*).  This is precisely because he still maintains the views of previous bourgeois political economists on the laws of production, while adopting the views of utopian socialists on the laws of distribution.
    Marxist-Leninist political economy regards the capitalist economy as a historical and transitional economy. Years of movement and development of the world capitalist economy have fully proved the correctness of Marxist-Leninist political economy theory, and conversely, proved the errors and reactionary nature of bourgeois political economy theory.  The establishment and development of socialist and new democratic economies is not only the inevitable result of the proletarian socialist revolution and the people's democratic revolution movement, but also the manifestation of the irresistible force of social development in human history.  It proves that not only can the laws of production of capitalism be changed, but in fact they have been completely changed in socialist society, and partially changed in new democratic society, and will continue to change.

　　Examples of Changes in Production and Distribution Relations in the Soviet Union
    In economic relations, production relations are fundamental, and in economic activities, production activities are fundamental.  Production relations play a dominant and decisive role in distribution relations, and production laws play a dominant and decisive role in distribution laws. For example, in the socialist country of the Soviet Union, due to the abolition of private ownership of the means of production, the means of production are owned by the whole society and become socialist property, belonging to the Soviet state.  The production relations there have changed, and therefore the distribution relations have also changed.  Production there is carried out in a planned way to meet the needs of the whole society. Production and distribution there are based on the principle of "from each according to his ability, to each according to his work." The parasitic and exploitative classes of landlords, rich peasants, and capitalists have been eliminated there, and the system of exploitation has been eliminated.  Therefore, there are no classes there, no exploitation, and the products are distributed according to the quantity and quality of labor contributed by each member of society. Not only has the blindness of production been eliminated there, and a fair distribution system has been implemented, but also under the leadership of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) and the Soviet government, based on the Soviet people's high level of conscious will, socialist economic construction is being consciously and systematically developed, further raising socialist productivity, so that socialist production can produce more abundant products to supply and meet all the needs of the Soviet people, preparing to transition to advanced communist society, and realize the principle of "from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs" in production and distribution.

　　政治经济学教程绪论（１８）
  　政治经济学的研究对象任务及其特点
    王学文
    但不论生产手段的分配，劳动力的分配，以及生产物的分配，在生产与分配之间仍然生产是基本的，起着主导的作用的。因为生产手段的分配与劳动力的分配，虽是“先行于生产，是生产的前提”，但归根结蒂都是为了生产，或者属于生产的。至于生产物的分配，乃是生产的结果，更完全是依存于生产的。同时，我们也不能忽视，随着分配的变化，生产也要起变化。例如生产手段劳动力的分配，是“决定生产的”进行的，其配备的多寡与良否，是会影响生产规模的大小与生产进行的。生产物的分配，及其分配的多少与良否，则是能影响人们的生活及劳动再生产的能力的。
　　对古典学派生产与分配关系的观点之批判
    古典学派资产阶级政治经济学者亚当·斯密与李嘉图等认为经济规律是自然规律，是永久不变的。以后约翰·穆勒则认为生产规律是不可变的，而分配规律却是可变的。
    亚当·斯密与李嘉图等关于经济规律的观点，是站在资产阶级的立场上代表资产阶级利益的反映。他们把资本主义社会看作固定不变永久性质的社会，因此把资本主义经济与资本主义的经济规律也同样地看作固定不可变易的经济与经济规律。约翰·穆勒的观点，照马克思的批评是“没有生气的折衷论”（资本论第二版跋文）。这正是因为他对于生产规律还维持从来资产阶级政治经济学者的观点，而对于分配规律却采取了空想社会主义的观点。
    马列主义政治经济学把资本主义经济看作是历史的过渡的性质的经济，多年来世界资本主义经济的运动与发展完全证明了马列主义政治经济学理论的正确，同时，正相反地证明了资产阶级政治经济学理论的错误与反动。社会主义与新民主主义经济的建立及其发展壮大，一方面是无产阶级社会主义革命与人民民主革命运动的必然的结果，同时也是人类历史上社会发展的不可抗拒的力量表现。它证明了不仅资本主义的生产规律是可以改变的，并且事实上在社会主义社会里已全部地改变，在新民主主义社会里也已部分地改变，并且还要继续地改变。
　　苏联生产关系与分配关系改变的例证
    在经济关系中，生产关系是基本的，在经济活动中，生产活动是基本的。生产关系对于分配关系、生产规律对于分配规律都是起着支配的决定的作用的。例如：在苏联社会主义国家里，由于废除了生产手段的私有，生产手段为全社会所公有，成为社会主义财产，属于苏维埃国家，那里的生产关系改变了，因此分配关系也就改变了。那里的生产是为全社会的需要而有计划地来进行的，那里的生产与分配是根据“各尽所能，各取所值”的原则来生产与分配的，那里已消灭了地主、富农及资本家这些寄生剥削的阶级，消灭了剥削制度。因此，在那里也就没有了阶级，没有了剥削，生产品是按照社会成员每一个人在劳动中所付出的劳动力的量和质来分配的，那里不但已消灭了生产的盲目性，实行了公平的分配制度，并且在联共（布）党与苏维埃政府的领导下，正基于苏维埃人民高度的自觉意志，有意识的有计划的次第发展着社会主义经济建设，更加高度地提高社会主义生产力，使社会主义生产能生产出更加丰富的生产物来，以便供给满足苏维埃人民的一切需要，准备过渡到高级共产主义社会，实现“各尽所能，各取所需”的生产与分配的原则。
