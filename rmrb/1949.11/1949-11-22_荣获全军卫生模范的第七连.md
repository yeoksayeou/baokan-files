Transmitted to Military Commander Xu, Deputy Political Commissar Zhu:
To all the commanders and fighters of the Seventh Company, Twentieth Regiment:
In 1948, the Field Sanitation Department called on the entire army to launch a sanitation and epidemic prevention campaign, focusing on improving food, reducing the incidence of disease, and enhancing combat effectiveness. Over the course of that year, facts have proven that due to the efforts of all comrades in your company, excellent results have been achieved.
The reason for your achievements is that your leadership ensured the implementation of sanitation work in all aspects and everyone worked hard to carry it out. The company leaders often solicited everyone's opinions, listened to the correct suggestions of the health workers, and personally participated as role models. Quartermaster Zhao Guangzhen is diligent in mind, legs, and mouth, wholeheartedly working to improve the food and serve the soldiers. Comrade Cheng Guohua, the health worker, worked tirelessly, carefully, patiently, and meticulously, inspiring and moving many comrades who were afraid of trouble and did not pay attention to hygiene. The correct understanding and leading role of cook Ding Shuangwang, especially the sufficient understanding and active action of all comrades under the call of "Pay attention to hygiene, don't get sick," resulted in your entire company not having a single case requiring hospitalization in 1948. This is rare in the entire army.
Therefore, we award your company the title of All-Army Hygiene Model for 1948 and call on all companies in the army to learn from you and compete with you in 1949. We hope you will remain humble and persistent, continue to improve, provide better food, prevent infectious diseases, reduce the incidence of general diseases, and strive to increase combat effectiveness and win more victories.
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Sincerely,
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Respectfully,
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Commander and Political Commissar Peng Dehuai
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Deputy Commanders Zhang Zongxun, Zhao Shoushan

　　　　Learn from the All-Army Hygiene Model Company
At the end of last year, the Logistics and Health Department of the Field Army sent people to the companies to inspect sanitation work. With the assistance of hygiene departments at all levels, they found that the work of the Seventh Company of the Fifth Regiment of the Second Brigade of the Third Column was the best. They only had 27 sporadic cases of gastrointestinal disease and 35 cases of colds throughout the year, and all of them recovered in the company without sending a single patient to the hospital. That is, out of the entire company of 110 people, not a single serious illness occurred in a year, so that training and combat were not affected by disease-related attrition. This had never happened in the entire army before. We now request the leaders of the Field Army Headquarters to commend the company as the All-Army Hygiene Model Company for 1948 and call on other companies in the army to learn from the company. Where exactly are they a model? Please see below.
　　　　Paying Attention to Hygiene Has Become a Daily Habit
First of all, the garrison area is always kept clean. As soon as you enter the village, you feel it is different from other places. The toilets are 50 meters away from the garrison, and rotten garbage is buried. No matter which squad you go to, the interior is clean and tidy, and the bowls and chopsticks are placed in a fixed position. Each soldier has a towel, washes their face once a day, washes their feet every three to seven days (washes their feet every day when marching), washes and irons their clothes once a week, cuts their nails once, gets a haircut every half month in summer, and once a month in winter, and bathes on time. On Sundays, they automatically sun their quilts and straw mats, and replace the straw mats every two to four weeks. They adopt a reverse sleeping pattern on the same bed at night. People with eye infections are prohibited from washing their faces with others. Patients are isolated in a timely manner. They do not eat melons and fruits indiscriminately in the summer. They only ate cold dishes twice, and they were all scalded with boiling water. When getting up to urinate at night, they pay attention to covering others with their quilts. When on sentry duty in the winter, the person on duty will wake up the person taking over in advance, put on their clothes, hat, and scarf around their neck before going out. When marching, if there is no boiled water, they must put disinfectant in the cold water before drinking it. These are their usual living habits. At the same time, they have a
　　　　Clean and Hygienic Kitchen
In this kitchen, you can't see rotten potatoes or yellow vegetable leaves scattered on the ground, and you can't get any dust on your hands when you touch the chopping board. The large tanks are washed frequently, and there is no mud at the bottom of the tanks. Radishes and potatoes are washed three times, and cabbage is washed at least twice. The cooked dishes and rice are covered with clean white cloth. The cooks' clothes are frequently changed and washed, the aprons are always white, the fingernails are frequently cut, and the hands are washed once before and after cooking. The cage cloths and cleaning cloths do not have any odor. The sewage pits in the summer are filled with dry soil every day. The cooking utensils all have a fixed position and are arranged neatly. People who are used to seeing dirty and messy kitchens may not believe it, but they actually do this often, and under the current supply standards, they have made planned adjustments.
　　　　Improved Food as Much as Possible
The phenomenon of mass meals has been eliminated. Usually, the entire company has eight to ten kilograms of (pork, mutton, beef) meat to eat every day. On average, each person can eat one to two taels of meat per day. During marching and combat, they bring their own dried vegetables or vermicelli, and even often have meat to eat. The way of cooking rice is also often adjusted. Three meals a week are steamed buns, dumplings, fried dough sticks, and steamed rolls. There is always enough boiled water in winter and summer, and it is available for those on sentry duty at night. The cooks pay attention to cooking techniques. The noodles are thin and fine, and more than 100 people can avoid eating糊糊面 (hú hú miàn, a kind of thick noodle soup). The dough for steamed buns is folded six times, so the steamed buns are white and fluffy. The meat is cut into thin slices or fine shreds and stir-fried. Before stir-frying the meat, scallions, garlic, sauce, and other seasonings are added to the oil. When the meat is almost cooked, the fresh vegetables are poured in and stir-fried over high heat before being served. The dishes cooked in this way taste good and are nutritious. Not only that, but they also
　　　　Hold Cooking Research Meetings Regularly
To review shortcomings and improve work - for example, if Comrade Ding Shuangwang steams good buns, everyone will ask him to report on the method and learn from him. Therefore, they have created some good methods. In winter, when the first pot of buns is cooked, dinner is served, and the soldiers are allowed to eat the hot buns fresh out of the steamer. Then, the first pot of buns is put back into the steamer and steamed again. When the soldiers are almost finished eating, this pot is cooked again, so that the soldiers eat comfortably. Every time pigs or sheep are slaughtered, the heads, hooves, stomachs, and blood (whose nutritional value is no less than meat) are carefully washed and cooked for the soldiers, which is both nourishing and economical. Why are they so conscientious, hardworking, and wholeheartedly serving the soldiers? First of all, because they
　　　　Have a Correct Understanding of Cooking Work
The cooks often say: "Our work is very important. If the rice is cooked well, the soldiers will be willing to eat it. If it is cooked hygienically, they won't get sick. If the soldiers are healthy, they can train well and win battles." Because they have such a deep understanding of their work, and at the same time, all the soldiers in the company have a considerable understanding of hygiene, so although the company has high mobility and the composition of the soldiers changes frequently, the above-mentioned excellent hygiene traditions of the company can be maintained and promoted. Naturally, the creation and persistence of this mass movement is inseparable from the correct leadership of the company.
　　　　Guarantee No Attrition Due to Illness
As a major event in the administrative management of the troops, it is often linked to hygiene in various meetings of the entire company, calling on and educating everyone. And from the leadership, it is guaranteed to be implemented in various tasks. In the summer, Company Commander Kang promptly adopted the health worker's opinion, strictly prohibiting indiscriminate eating of melons and fruits, and alternately checked the beds with the health worker at night to cover the soldiers with their quilts. When calling the roll, he arranged each squad in order and praised and criticized the sanitation situation. Secondly, Quartermaster Zhao Guangzhen's work has
　　　　Three Major Secrets
That is, diligence in mind, diligence in legs, and diligence in mouth - he often conducts surveys and research from nearby people to find out where he can buy vegetables or meat, and where the price is cheap. He often carries the burden to buy things sixty or seventy miles away. Others can only buy two catties of radishes for 10,000 yuan nearby, but he can buy five or six catties in the distance. Others buy pork for 80,000 yuan per catty, but he can buy it for 70,000 yuan. He can correctly grasp economic expenditures and use the money for the right projects (unlike some units that spend more than 20 catties of tobacco leaves and more than 15 or 16 catties of lamp oil per month on food expenses). The food can be adjusted automatically. Each month, he summarizes the accounts through the economic committee and announces them to everyone. The noodles, vegetables, oil, etc. eaten at each meal are accurately weighed by the kitchen duty officer, and he humbly accepts everyone's inspection and supervision. He can mobilize the soldiers to give him ideas and humbly listen to everyone's correct opinions. He is always worried about how to feed the soldiers well, how to adjust the food, save money, etc., regardless of day or night. He often cooks according to the number of people. If the previous meal was good, the next meal will definitely not be much, and Lao Ding will guide the cooks to cook less rice. Because he can grasp the changes in this situation, their rice is never left over too much or not enough to eat. Over time, this will save a lot of things. The soldiers praised Comrade Ding Shuangwang on the wall newspaper:——
"Comrade Ding Shuangwang is really capable, he is busy from morning to night, others are unwilling to carry water, Lao Ding automatically carries the water, the water tank is full and full, and dinner is opened on time, the steamed buns others make are dead and sour, Lao Ding makes the steamed buns white and soft, every comrade eats them, adding oil to train soldiers without delay."
　　　　The Health Worker Comrade is Really Good
Comrade Cheng Guohua, regardless of fatigue during the march, went to dig toilets himself and helped the soldiers carry straw mats. When the soldiers were tired and didn't want to wash their feet, he was afraid that everyone's feet would hurt, so he personally boiled water for everyone to wash their feet, urged everyone to drink boiled water, and applied medicine to those who had blisters. When there was no time to boil water, he found a bucket himself, carried cold water, and put disinfectant in it to let the soldiers drink. During the summer garrison period, he carried a lantern to each squad every night to check the beds, patiently cared for the patients, gave them medicine and water on time, and was able to patiently persuade the patients. Hao Guicheng was sick and didn't want to eat, so he cooked rice for Hao. Hao Guicheng gratefully said: "I must eat more of the rice cooked by the health worker." Yin ×liang had severe scabies, but he was afraid of pain and was always unwilling to wash. After Comrade Cheng Guohua's repeated patient explanations, he was finally moved. When he was treated for scabies, he patted his chest and said: "I'm not afraid anymore, treat me." Under Comrade Cheng's patient care, his scabies healed quickly. He often went to the kitchen and various squads to check and supervise sanitation work, and gave the cooks and soldiers hygiene knowledge. He promptly reflected the good and bad situations he saw to the company leaders and put forward good opinions. When the hygiene groups of each platoon in the company had not yet been established, after he actively proposed it three times, he finally organized the masses, so that sanitation work was recognized by the majority of soldiers and became the daily work of the vast masses themselves, jointly carried out and jointly supervised, and naturally formed the "guarantee of no attrition due to illness" as a political task. He often organized mutual competitions among the squads, so that everyone believed that if there was a patient in the squad, it was a shame for the whole squad. In addition to the administrative importance, this is also due to the health worker's achievements. It is precisely because the soldiers liked it, the cadres were happy, and he had prestige that Comrade Cheng Guohua had even more confidence and worked even harder. He was recognized as a model and became a hero at several military conferences. From this, the soldiers can see that the good sanitation work and fewer patients in the Seventh Company are not accidental.
　　　　In the Final Analysis
We believe it is: (1) After the overall soldiers' class consciousness was improved, they realized that to eliminate the enemy, they must have a healthy body, and to not get sick, they must pay attention to hygiene. Therefore, everyone has organized and consciously paid attention to various hygiene aspects, which is an important reason for fewer diseases. (2) First of all, those in charge take the lead and personally do it. For example, Comrade Li Fadong, the head of the regiment, often organizes responsible cadres and company representatives from various units to personally inspect and supervise the implementation of company sanitation work, which has played a great role in the sanitation work of the regiment. In addition, Company Commander Kang's specific guarantee and conscientious implementation (Company Commander Kang studied sanitation subjects carefully when studying at the training team, and realized the importance of company sanitation work ideologically), so sanitation work is easy to promote. (3) The biggest feature is that it focuses on improving food as the central task of reducing diseases. The reasons why food can be improved include the following points in addition to the leaders being responsible: (1) The management and education of administrative personnel is good, and class consciousness is improved, so they can wholeheartedly serve the soldiers, overcome difficulties, and come up with ideas. (2) Administrative personnel have a correct understanding of the work, can work hard and be responsible, pay attention to economy, are willing to think of ways, are creative, and break the old work style. (3) Economic expenditures are planned and proactive, can follow the mass line, implement economic democracy, and listen to and implement the opinions of the masses. (4) Hygiene personnel have a class consciousness of wholeheartedly serving the soldiers, can personally do it, can think of ways, and do not deviate from the masses and the reality, nor reduce scientific standards, which is a new phenomenon among hygiene personnel. This proves that political education and business improvement of hygiene personnel are both very important.

　　荣获全军卫生模范的第七连许军长、朱副政委转
    二十团七连全体指战员：
    一九四八年野卫号召全军展开卫生防疫运动，着重改善伙食，减少疾病发生，增强战斗力，在这一年的过程中，事实证明由于你们全连同志的努力而获得优良的成绩。
    获得成绩的原因，是因为你们领导上保证了卫生工作在各方面的贯彻和大家的努力实行，连首长经常征求大家的意见，倾听卫生员的正确建议，并以身作则亲自参加。赵广珍事务长，脑勤、腿勤、嘴勤，一心一意的把伙食搞好，为战士服务。卫生员程国华同志不顾疲劳，细心耐心认真的一点一滴的工作，启发和感动了许多怕麻烦不讲卫生的同志。炊事员丁双旺同志的正确认识与带头作用，特别是全体同志在“讲卫生，不生病”的号召下，有了足够的认识与积极行动，所以一九四八年一年中你们全连没有发生一回需要送医院的病号，这一点在全军来说还是少见的事情。
    因此我们给你连以一九四八年全军卫生模范的称号，并号召全军所有连队在一九四九年中向你们学习，和你们竞赛，希望你们不骄不倦坚持下去，继续提高一步，把伙食办的更好，预防传染病，使更少的发生一般疾病，为提高战斗力多打胜仗而奋斗。　　　　　此致
    敬礼！
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　司令员兼政委　彭德怀
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　副司令员　张宗逊　赵寿山
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　一九四九年三月二十日
    　　　　向全军卫生模范连看齐
    去年年底，野战军后勤卫生部派人下连队检查卫生工作，在各级卫生机关协助下，发现了三纵二旅五团七连的工作最好。他们全年只零星发生了二十七个肠胃病，三十五个感冒，而且都在连上休养好了，没送给医院一个病人。也就是全连一百一十人，在一年中没发生过一个重病号，使练兵和战斗都没有受到疾病减员的影响。这是全军以前没有的事情，现呈请野战军司令部首长嘉奖该连为一九四八年全军卫生模范连，并号召全军其他连队向该连看齐，究竟他们模范在什么地方呢？请看他们
    　　　　已把注意卫生成为日常的生活习惯
    首先是驻地经常保持清洁，一进村子就使人感觉与别处不同，厕所在驻地五十米以外，腐臭垃圾均予掩埋，随便你跑到那一班去，内务都是干净、整齐，碗筷放在一定位置。战士们每人有一条毛巾，每天洗一次脸，三至七天洗一次脚（行军每天洗一次脚），每星期洗烫衣服一次，剪指甲一次，夏天半月理发一次，冬天一月一次，按时洗澡，一到星期天就自动晒被毯和铺草，二至四周更换铺草一次。晚上同炕睡觉采取颠倒睡的方式。禁止害眼的人和别人在一起洗脸，有了病号及时隔离，夏天不乱吃瓜果，总共吃了两次凉拌菜，还都是用开水烫洗过的。晚上起来小便时，都能注意替别人盖被子。冬天夜里放哨，由带班的人预先把接班的人叫醒，穿好衣服，戴好帽子，脖子上围好手巾，然后才出去。行军时没有开水，一定先在冷水里放上消毒药再喝。这些就是他们平常的生活习惯，同时他们还有一个
    　　　　清洁卫生的伙房
    这个火房里经常看不到滥洋芋、黄菜叶在地上散堆，案板上随便用手去摸沾不上一点灰尘，大缸常洗，缸底没有积泥。吃萝葡、洋芋要洗三次，白菜最少也洗两次。做的菜饭都用干净的白布盖好。炊事员的衣服经常换洗，围裙经常洁白，指甲经常剪去，做饭前后均洗手一次，笼布擦布没有臭味，夏天污水坑每天填干土一次，炊事用具都有一定位置。排列的整整齐齐，这在看惯了伙房肮脏零乱的人们，恐怕有点不大相信，可是他们实际上经常就是这样，而且在现行的供给标准下，他们作了有计划的调剂。
    　　　　尽善尽美地改善了伙食
    消除了大会餐的现象，平时全连每天都有八至十斤的（猪、羊、牛）肉吃，平均每人每天能吃肉一至二两。行军作战中，有自带的干菜或粉条，甚至也常有肉吃，饭的作法也常调剂，每礼拜有三顿是吃饱子、饺子、油条、花卷等。不论冬夏随时有足够的开水，夜里放哨都能喝到，炊事员同志们很注意做饭做菜技术，面条赶的又细又薄，一百多人能做到不吃糊糊面，做馍馍的面摺到六次，所以蒸出的馍又白又虚。肉都切成很薄的肉片或很细的肉丝，用来生炒，炒肉以前，油里一定先放葱蒜酱等调料。肉快炒熟时，再把生菜倒上，用大火一炒，就盛起来，这样炒成的菜味道又好又养人。不仅如此，他们还
    　　　　经常开炊事研究会
    检讨缺点，改进工作——如：丁双旺同志蒸的馍好，大家就请他报告做法，向他学习。因此他们就创造了一些好办法，冬天吃馍等第一锅熟了时开饭，先让战士们吃刚出笼的热馍，紧接着将头一笼馍再放到笼里蒸上，等战士们吃的快完了，这一锅又蒸熟了，这样就使战士们吃的很舒服，每次杀猪宰羊的头、蹄、肚、血（营养价值并不比肉低）他们都耐心的洗净，做给战士们吃了，既养人又节省，他们为什么能够这样认真负责，吃苦耐劳，一心一意为战士服务呢？首先由于他们
    　　　　对炊事工作有正确的认识
    炊事员们常说：“我们的工作很重要，饭做的好，战士们肯吃，做的卫生吃了不害病，战士们身体好，练兵就能练的好，就能打胜仗。因为他们对自己的工作有这样深刻的认识，同时全连战士对于卫生也有相当的了解，所以尽管连队上流动性大，战士们的成份经常变化，但上述该连的这些优良卫生传统，却能保持与发扬。自然，这种群众运动的造成与坚持，与该连的正确领导是分不开的。
    　　　　保证不因病减员
    当做部队行政管理上的一件大事，经常在全连的各种会议上联系到卫生方面的事情，号召与教育大家。并从领导上保证在各种工作中贯彻实行。夏天，康连长及时采纳卫生员的意见，严格禁止乱吃瓜果，夜里和卫生员轮流查铺，替战士们盖好被子，点名时即把各班排好，卫生的好坏情形，提出表扬与批评。其次，司务长赵广珍同志工作，有
    　　　　三大秘诀
    就是脑勤、腿勤、嘴勤——他经常向附近群众做调查研究，打听从那里能买到菜或肉，又那里价钱便宜，常亲自担着担子到六、七十里以外去买东西，别人在附近一万元只能买到二斤萝葡，他到远处却能买到五、六斤，别人买猪肉一斤八万，他却七万就买到了。他对经济开支能正确的掌握，什么款子就用在什么项目上，（不象有的单位每月用伙食费买二十多斤烟叶，灯油每月超过十五、六斤），伙食能自动的调剂。每月通过经济委员会总结帐目，给大家公布。每顿吃的面、菜、油……等等都经厨房值日精确的过秤，并虚心接受大家的检查、监督。能发动战士给他出主意，虚心听大家的正确意见，不管白天黑夜都操心着怎样给战士们吃好？怎样把伙食调剂？节约……等，经常按照人数开饭，如果上一顿吃的好，下顿一定吃不多，老丁就指导伙夫做饭时少做点。由于能掌握这种情况的变化，他们的饭从没有剩下很多或不够吃。这样时间长了，就会节约许多东西。战士们这样在墙报上称赞丁双旺同志：——
    “丁双旺同志真能干，一天起来忙到晚，别人不愿去挑水，老丁自动把水担，水缸担的满又满，不误时间开了饭，别人蒸馍死又酸，老丁蒸馍白又软，个个同志抱着吃，加油练兵不迟慢。”
    　　　　卫生员同志真正好
    程国华同志在行军中不顾疲劳，他自己去挖厕所，替战士们抱铺草，战士累了不想洗脚，他怕大家脚痛，亲自去给大家烧洗脚水，督促大家喝开水，给打了泡的人上药，来不及烧开水时，自己找桶担来冷水放上消毒药，叫战士们喝，夏季驻军时期，天天夜里提着灯笼到各班里去查铺，耐心看护病员，给他们按时吃药送水，并能耐心说服病人，郝贵成病了，不想吃饭，他替郝煮饭，郝贵成感激的说：“卫生员做的饭，我一定要多吃一些。”尹×亮害疥很重，可是他怕痛，老不愿意洗，经程国华同志几次的耐心解释，终于被感动了，到了冶疥时，他把胸膛一拍说：“不怕了，给我治吧”。在程同志耐心护理下，他的疥很快好了。他经常到伙房和各班排中检查督促卫生工作。给炊事员及战士们讲卫生常识，将看到的好坏情形及时的向连首长反映，很好的提出意见。当连里各排的卫生小组还没有建立起来时，经他积极的提了三次以后，终于把群众组织起来，使卫生工作经过大多数战士的认识，变为广大群众自己的日常工作，共同进行，共同监督执行，很自然的形成，“保证不因病减员”当成一个政治任务。经常的组织各班互相比赛，使大家认为班里有了病号，就是全班的耻辱。这除了行政上的重视以外，就要算卫生员的成绩了。正因为战士们喜欢，干部高兴，有了威信，程国华同志的信心就更高了，工作干的更起劲了，几次的军人大会上都被大家认为模范，当了功臣。由此战士们可以见到七连的卫生工作作的好病号少，亦不是偶然的。
    　　　　归根结底
    我们以为是：（一）全体战士在阶级觉悟提高了以后，认识到要消灭敌人，必须要有健康的身体，要不生病，必须要讲卫生。所以大家都有组织的，自觉的注意各项卫生，这是疾病少的重要原因。（二）首先负责亲自动手，如该团的团长李伐东同志常组织各单位负责干部和连队代表亲自检查，督促连队卫生工作的实施，对该团卫生工作起了很大作用。加上康连长的具体保证与认真推行（康连长在教导队学习时，对卫生课目研究认真，从思想上认识到连队卫生工作的重要）所以卫生工作就容易推行。（三）最大的特点，着重了改善伙食，作为减少疾病的中心工作，伙食能搞好的原因，除了首长负责外，尚有以下几点：（１）事务人员的管理教育好，阶级觉悟提高了，就能全心全意为战士服务，就能克服困难想出办法。（２）事务人员对工作有正确的认识，能吃苦负责，注意节约，肯想办法，有创造性，打破了老一套的工作作风。（３）经济开支有计划能主动，能走群众路线，实行经济民主，听取与实行了群众的意见。（４）卫生人员有全心全意为战士服务的阶级觉悟，能亲自动手，能想办法，既不脱离群众与现实情况，又不降低科学水准，这是卫生人员中的新气象。这证明对卫生人员的政治教育与业务提高都是很重要的。
