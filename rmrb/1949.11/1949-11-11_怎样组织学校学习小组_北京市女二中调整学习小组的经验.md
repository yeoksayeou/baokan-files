How to Organize School Study Groups
    ——The Experience of Adjusting Study Groups at Beijing No. 2 Girls' Middle School
    Beijing No. 2 Girls' Middle School Correspondence Group
    Editor's Note: This method of organizing school study groups is a coordinated application of "planned allocation of core members" and "free association," and it also mobilizes the masses and conducts ideological education, avoiding the problem of formalism. Other schools can refer to this experience to solve the problems of their own school study groups based on their specific circumstances. Generally speaking, this method may not be very suitable for freshman classes that have just started school, because students are not yet familiar with each other, and the conditions for electing core members and freely associating are not yet mature.

    At the beginning of this semester, the school called for strengthening group study and explained the importance of group life. Our Senior 3 Class A was the first to respond to the call and organize groups. But at that time, we did not have an urgent need for group life. Before grouping, there was no full discussion on the importance of group life and the method of grouping. We only formed groups based on those with whom we usually had good feelings or were often together. With this grouping, the number of people was inconsistent, and there was a tendency to form small cliques. Some groups had members who were very good at academic studies, and they felt that group study was not as fast or good as studying on their own, so they were perfunctory about group study; some groups were used to being free and undisciplined, and they felt that having a group was a kind of constraint, so they used being busy as an excuse to not hold meetings. This made it impossible for the groups to unite; some groups were nominal, with the group leader being afraid of holding meetings and treating the group as a chore to deal with. When other groups held meetings, our group also held meetings; when other groups discussed, our group also discussed. In fact, meetings were only formalities, and discussions were just everyone answering questions together. Some even had one person write an essay and read it to everyone as a summary of the discussion to complete the task. This kind of phenomenon became more and more serious, and the grade director repeatedly asked us if there was a need for reorganization, but we always felt that we had good feelings for each other and were unwilling to separate. In several political classes and other academic tests, some groups were very good, and some groups were relatively poor. The scores between the group members were too disparate. Those with academic difficulties were still at a loss, and the atmosphere of rote learning and striving for points had not been eliminated. In various extracurricular activities, our class was always lagging behind. Analyzing the reason, it was because we were not united internally, and the connection between groups was not enough. Some groups only engaged in academic studies and did not participate in extracurricular activities; some groups had individual members participating in activities, but they did not drive the group, let alone unite the group and drive the whole class. Therefore, the collective learning and group activities of our class were lagging behind everywhere, which deeply affected the students' learning mood. So, we had the need to adjust the groups.

    When discussing the democratic covenant, each group conscientiously reviewed the previous shortcomings. We deeply felt that only by doing a good job of each group's foundation and uniting with each other could we do a good job of the class. In this class meeting, the grade director once again raised the issue of adjusting the groups. At first, the students did not speak fully. In reason, they felt it was right, but emotionally, they could not fully accept it. At this time, the activists played a role, calling on the students to make ideological struggles and consider the reorganization problem from reality. So, everyone began to speak, conducting reviews and criticisms, pointing out the shortcomings and advantages of each group. Everyone realized the past biases and reasons, and they all expressed that there was indeed a need to adjust the groups. But how to adjust? Some proposed that good groups exchange members with relatively poor groups, and some proposed a study abroad approach. But through ideological struggle, we unanimously demanded a thorough reorganization. Finally, it was decided to first elect six group leaders. These six group leaders must have sufficient understanding, high academic level, and be able to unite and lead the masses. After the group leaders were elected, six students with higher political levels and six students with better academic skills were selected and carefully assessed and assigned to appropriate groups. In this way, each group had core members. Other students then reported which group they wanted to go to based on their own willingness. In this warm atmosphere, most students were able to consider their appropriate position for the sake of the whole class based on the specific situation. As a result, what was originally a tedious and time-consuming procedure was completed quickly. Some students had no idea and were willing to listen to the decision of the masses. One student, who had previously engaged in small cliques, said very frankly when the meeting sought his opinion: "I can go to any group, but don't go to the fourth group, because I used to be in a small clique with the students in the fourth group."

    After the assignment was completed, the newly appointed group leader announced the list of all members of the group. Everyone considered it carefully again, and adjustments were made immediately if there was anything inappropriate. But within the possible range, personal wishes were also appropriately taken care of. This grouping took a total of two hours. During the meeting, the students fully demonstrated the spirit of democracy and deeply realized that only centralization under a democratic approach is a powerful centralization. At the same time, when assigning, everyone connected with the past, combined with ideology, and considered the problem from a comprehensive perspective, separating those who had previously engaged in small cliques, breaking the previous height divisions, and adjusting the advanced and backward groups. We feel that this grouping was relatively successful, and the reason for its success was reliance on the consciousness and strength of the masses.

    怎样组织学校学习小组
    ——北京市女二中调整学习小组的经验
    北京市女二中通讯组
    编者按：这种学校学习小组的组织方法，是“有计划的配备骨干”与“自由结合”的配合运用，并发动了群众，进行了思想教育，避免了形式主义的毛病。其他学校可根据自己学校的具体情况，参考这一经验解决本校学习小组的问题。一般说来，这种办法对于开学不久的新生班次，恐不大适合，因为同学间彼此还不够熟悉，选举骨干和自由结合的条件还不成熟。
    本季开学，学校号召加强小组学习，并说明小组生活的重要。我们高三甲班首先响应号召，组织小组。但那时我们对小组生活还没有迫切的要求。在分组以前，没有充分讨论小组生活的重要性及分组的方法。我们只以平常感情好或经常在一起的凑成一组。这样分组，人数多少既不一致，并且形成了搞小圈子的偏向。有的组组员业务学习很好，觉得小组学习总不如自己学习又快又好，对小组学习很马虎；有的组组员自由散漫惯了，有了小组觉得是种束缚，就借口事忙，不开会。使小组不能团结；也有的组是有名无实，组长首先就怕开会，拿小组当差事应付，别组开会，我组也开会；别组讨论，我组也讨论，其实开会只是形式，讨论也不过大家在一起回答问题，甚至有的叫一个人作一篇文，给大家念念，就作讨论的总结，交差了事。这种种现象，愈来愈严重，级主任再三问我们有没有改组的必要，而我们总觉得彼此感情不错，不愿分离。几次政治课和其他业务的测验，有的组很好，有的组较差，组员间的成绩太悬殊了，业务困难的仍旧束手无策，而死读书，争分数的风气，也还没有消除，在各种课外活动中，我们班也总是落后。分析其原因，是我们内部没有团结，小组间的联系不够，有的小组专搞业务，而不参加课外活动；有的小组个别组员参加活动，却没有带动小组，更没有团结小组，带动全班，因而本班的集体学习与团体活动处处落后，深深地影响了同学的学习情绪，于是我们有了调整小组的要求。
    在讨论民主公约的时候，各小组切实检讨了以往的缺点，我们深深地感觉到：只有把每一小组的基础搞好，互相团结，才能把班搞好，在这次班会中，级主任再度提出调整小组的问题，同学们起先没有充分的发言，在理智上觉得对，但感情上仍不能完全接受。这时积极分子起了作用，号召同学作思想斗争，由实际出发考虑改组问题，于是大家开始发言，进行了检讨与批评，指出各组的缺点与优点，大家认识了过去的偏向和原因，便都表示确有调整小组的必要，但是怎样调整呢？有的提议好的小组与比较差的小组交换组员，有的提议留学方式，但是我们通过了思想斗争，一致要求彻底的改组，最后决定先选六个小组长，这六个小组长必须认识够，业务水平高，而且能团结群众，领导群众，小组长选出后，又选出了六个政治水平较高的和六个业务较好的同学，由大家慎重评定分配到适当的组中，这样每一小组都有了骨干，其他同学便根据自愿，报告自己愿去那一组，在这种热烈的空气下，大多数同学都能根据具体情况，为全班着想，考虑自己的适当的位置，结果本来是繁琐费事的手续却很快的完成了，还有些同学，自己没了主意，愿听从群众的决定，有一位同学，以前曾搞过小圈子，当大会征求他的意见时，她很坦白的说：“我到那一组都成，只是不要到第四组，因为我和第四组的同学曾搞过小圈子。”
    分配完了，新任组长宣布了本组全体组员的名单，大家再慎重考虑，有不合适的即时调整，但在可能范围内，也适当地照顾了个人的志愿，这次分组总共用了二小时，在大会进行中同学们充分发挥了民主精神，也深切地认识到只有民主方式下的集中，才是有力的集中，同时在分配的时候，大家都联系过去，结合思想，从全面来考虑问题，把以前搞小圈子的分开了，把以前个子高矮的界线打破了，进步与落后的组调整了。我们觉得这次的分组是比较成功的，而成功的原因是依靠了群众的觉悟与力量。
