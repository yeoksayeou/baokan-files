Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 28th. The News reports published an editorial celebrating the 25th anniversary of the founding of the Mongolian People's Republic. The editorial stated: Thanks to socialist friendship and its multi-faceted, selfless assistance, one of the most backward nations in the East, which not long ago was groaning under feudalism and foreign imperialism, has been able to embark on the path of national progress and prosperity. The characteristic of the path taken by the Mongolian people in the past twenty-five years is the brilliant realization of the Leninist-Stalinist theory that backward countries, with the help of victorious proletarian countries, can skip the stage of capitalist development. Lenin wrote: "With the help of the proletariat of the most advanced countries, backward countries can move to the Soviet system and, after a certain stage of development, can skip the stage of capitalist development and transition to communism." The experience of socialist development in the backward and remote areas of Tsarist Russia in the past has made an inestimable contribution to the Mongolian people.

　　The News reports pointed out: In the twenty-five years of the independent existence of the Mongolian People's Republic, a new socialist system represented by state-owned and cooperative enterprises in industry, agriculture, transportation, and communications has emerged domestically. The exclusion of private capital in retail trade, the complete state ownership of foreign trade, and the existence of a single national bank—all these have ensured the creation of further conditions necessary for the country's socialist development. Due to the complete liquidation of the feudal landlord class and the implementation of policies to restrict and exclude capitalist elements, Mongolian society is now essentially composed of two friendly classes—workers and peasants. The national economy of the Mongolian People's Republic is developing according to plan. The Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy and Culture (1948-1952), adopted at the end of 1947, guarantees the further upsurge of the economy and culture of the Mongolian People's Republic.

　　The editorial continued: In twenty-five years, the Mongolian People's Republic has become "an independent state of working people that has destroyed imperialism and feudal oppression and ensured the non-capitalist development of the country to ultimately transition to socialism." (Constitution of the Mongolian People's Republic, adopted in 1940)

　　消息报评论　蒙古发展道路
    【新华社北京二十八日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯，消息报发表社论庆祝蒙古人民共和国成立二十五周年。社论称：由于社会主义的友谊及其多方面的大公无私的援助，使不久以前还呻吟在封建主义与外国帝国主义压迫下的东方最落后民族之一，能够走上国家进步与兴盛的道路。蒙古人民在二十五年中所走过的道路的特点，乃是列宁、斯大林主义下述理论的辉煌的实现，即落后国家在胜利的无产阶级国家帮助下，能够跳过资本主义的发展阶段。列宁曾写道：“在最进步国家的无产阶级帮助下落后国家能够渡到苏维埃的制度，而且经过一定的发展阶段能够跳越过资本主义发展阶段而过渡到共产主义。”过去沙俄落后偏僻地区的社会主义发展的经验，对蒙古人民有不可估计的贡献。
    消息报指出：在蒙古人民共和国独立存在二十五年的过程中，国内已产生了以工业、农业、运输业与交通事业中的国营与合作社企业为代表的新的社会主义制度。零售贸易中的私人资本的被排除，对外贸易的全部国营与单一的国家银行的存在——这一切使创造国家向社会主义发展所需的进一步条件，得到了保证。由于封建地主阶级完全被清算，并实行限制与排除资本主义成份的政策，蒙古社会目前在本质上说是由两个友好的阶级——工人与农民所构成。蒙古人民共和国的国民经济是按照计划发展的。一九四七年年底通过的发展国民经济与文化的五年计划（一九四八年到一九五二年），保证着蒙古人民共和国经济与文化的进一步高涨。
    社论继称：蒙古人民共和国在二十五年中已变为“摧毁了帝国主义与封建压迫，并确保国家之非资本主义发展以最后过渡到社会主义的、劳动人民的独立国家。”（蒙古人民共和国的宪法，一九四零年通过）
