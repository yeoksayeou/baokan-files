Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 7th:

　　Recently, locust nymphs and aphids have been discovered in fifteen counties including Quuyang, Wei (a newly established county north of the Zhanghe River), Cang, Lingshou, and Wu'an in Hebei Province, and Anyang County in Pingyuan Province. The people's governments of these counties are mobilizing the masses to exterminate them. The above-mentioned counties did not completely eliminate locusts this summer, causing the remaining locust eggs to develop and grow. After the pest outbreak, the Hebei Provincial Government immediately telegraphed various regions to eradicate them promptly. After the discovery of locust nymphs in Quuyang, the county government immediately convened an emergency meeting, deciding to postpone all non-urgent tasks and quickly lead the farmers to eradicate them. The county, district, and village-level locust-catching command posts were restored, reconnaissance and reporting were strengthened, areas were delineated, and responsibilities were clarified. The meeting, based on the experience of catching locust nymphs this spring, decided on many specific methods for locust extermination. After the meeting, fifty-one county and district cadres were dispatched to various districts and villages to lead the catching efforts. After the discovery of locusts in Jianping, the county magistrate, the secretary of the CCP County Committee, and others personally went to the disaster areas to organize farmers to catch them. Twelve villages caught more than four hundred catties in one day. After the discovery of locusts in the Fourth District of Wei County, district and village cadres and CCP members mobilized more than 1,500 people to catch them continuously, and they were completely eliminated by the 10th of last month. Aphids were found on vegetables in the disaster area of Jinghai County, and many victims were demoralized, believing that "the cabbage harvest will be a failure this year." Li Jianguang, the secretary of the CCP County Committee, personally visited experienced old farmers to learn how to control aphids and suggested that various districts and villages adopt these methods. The county supply and marketing cooperative sent people out at night to buy medicine to help the masses control aphids. Regions that have not yet discovered pests but are adjacent to pest-affected areas, such as Xinle, Anguo, and Hejian in Hebei, Licheng in Shanxi, and Tianzhen in Chahar, are mobilizing women and children to collect pupae and dig up eggs in conjunction with autumn plowing.

　　河北曲阳等县发现蝗蝻
  　各地紧急动员务期迅速扑灭
    【新华社北京七日电】河北省曲阳、魏县（漳河北岸新设县）、沧县、灵寿、武安等十五县和平原省安阳县，最近发现蝗蝻和蚜虫。各县人民政府正发动群众进行剿灭。上述县份因今夏除蝗不净，留下的蝗卵又发育成长。虫害发生后，河北省政府即电令各地及时扑灭。曲阳于发现蝗蝻后，该县县政府当即召开紧急会议，决定一切不急之务暂缓进行，迅速领导农民扑灭，并恢复县、区、村三级捕虫指挥部，加强侦察报告，划定地区，明确责任。会议鉴于今春捕打蝗蝻经验，并决定了许多灭蝗的具体办法。会后，县区干部五十一人已分赴各区村领导捕打。建屏发现蝗虫后，该县县长、中共县委书记等都亲赴灾区组织农民捕打，十二个村一天即打了四百余斤。魏县四区发现蝗虫后，区村干部和中共党员动员一千五百余人，连续捕打，已于上月十日完全消灭。静海县灾区蔬菜发现蚜虫，不少灾民情绪低落，认为“天年不收白菜”。该县中共县委书记李建刚即亲自访问有经验的老农，学习治蚜虫办法，建议各区村采用。该县供销社则派人星夜出外买药，帮助群众除治蚜虫。尚未发现而邻近虫害的地区，如河北新乐、安国、河间，山西的黎城，察哈尔的天镇等地，则结合秋耕，发动妇女儿童拾蛹挖卵。
