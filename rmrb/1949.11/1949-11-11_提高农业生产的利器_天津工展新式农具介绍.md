	Wei Jin

At the Tianjin Industrial Exhibition, a batch of new-style farm implements produced by the North China State-Owned Agricultural Machinery General Factory are of extremely significant importance for remedying the shortage of rural labor. Many farmer representatives call these new-style farm implements a vital new force for increasing agricultural production, and this is no exaggeration; these new-style farm implements are indeed powerful tools for increasing agricultural production.

These new-style farm implements are many times better than old-fashioned farm implements, whether in terms of efficiency or use. Here are seven types of farm implements manufactured by imitating Soviet models: 1. Ten-Row Seeder. Using two animals, it can sow 50 to 60 mu per day; using a tractor, it can sow 200 to 250 mu per day. It can sow ten rows at a time. Automatically opens furrows and sows seeds. The seeds are loaded in a box and fall into holes along the distribution pipes. The size of the seeds, the spacing between rows, the depth of the furrows, and the amount of sowing can all be freely adjusted. When not in use, the furrow-opening discs can be raised, making movement extremely convenient. The machine is equipped with iron ring chains at the rear for covering the soil, with the depth and tightness being very suitable. 2. Chaff Cutter: Used for cutting grain stalks to feed livestock. Using one person or a 1-horsepower electric motor, it can cut about 2,000 jin of grass per hour; the action is rapid, ten times faster than old-fashioned grass knives. 3. Double-Handle Plow: Can be pulled by one animal, and can plow 8 to 10 mu of land per day. It has a plow knife attached in front to break hard soil and cut off creeping weeds. In areas with dense weeds, plowing with this plow will bury all the weeds in the soil, creating a green manure effect. After plowing, the furrows are flat and conducive to crop growth. 4. Wheel Plow: Used for plowing fields and reclaiming wasteland. Easy to operate, using two animals, it can plow land 12 inches wide at a time, and can plow 15 to 20 mu per day. The plow tip is sharp, making this plow most suitable for wasteland, grassland, and hard ground, and it works even better when plowing deeply. 5. Mowing Machine: Specifically for cutting pasture grass or cereal crops. Using two animals, it can cut 50 mu per day. The person sits on the machine seat, and as the machine moves forward, the blades reciprocate, and the grass stems are cut as they pass through the streamlined serrations. 6. Seed Cleaner: Used for cleaning seeds and cleaning grains. Using a 1-horsepower electric motor or manpower, it can clean 300 jin of seeds per hour. After processing wheat, sorghum, millet, beans, etc. with this machine, sand and dross are thoroughly removed, and seeds of uniform size are selected. 7. Hay Rake: Used to collect cut pasture grass or crops. Using two animals, it can harvest about 100 mu per day. One person can operate it, saving more than ten times the time compared to manual harvesting. It is most suitable for grassland and pastoral areas.

There are nine types of farm implements that have been transformed from old-fashioned farm implements: 1. Liberation-Style Cultivator: Can be used for hoeing, weeding, and earthing up. Using one animal, it can hoe 25 to 30 mu of land per day. This implement is equipped with various shovel blades, which can be changed into ten different forms to suit various crops. 2. Small Seeder: Used for sowing seeds. One person can sow 5 to 8 mu per day. It is ten times more convenient than manual sowing. The seed container has thirteen different sizes of holes to accommodate different sizes of seeds. 3. Five-Tooth Cultivator: Used for hoeing, weeding, and earthing up. Using one animal, it can hoe 25 to 30 mu of land per day. This saves at least ten times the labor compared to the old-fashioned hoeing method. This implement has five teeth, which are evenly spaced in front and back, harrowing the soil finely, at a moderate depth, weeding cleanly, and can earth up on both sides. 4. Corn Sheller: Specifically for shelling corn. Manually operated, it can shell 150 jin of corn per hour. It is ten times faster than manual shelling or using scrapers. 5. Leather Roller Cotton Gin: Using a 1-horsepower electric motor, it can gin 28 jin of lint cotton per hour. 6. Three-Stage High-Pressure Water Pump: Used for irrigation and drainage. Powered by a 15-horsepower electric motor, it can irrigate high-lying areas or fill factory water towers. It delivers 100 tons of water per hour. 7. Thresher: Used for threshing grain crops. Electric and manual power are both available. It can thresh 200 jin per hour. 8. Tractor Plow: Used for plowing land. Towed by a 12-horsepower tractor, it can plow 6 mu of land per hour. 9. Rice Thresher: Used for threshing rice. Manually foot-operated, it can thresh 300 jin per hour.

The North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory has invented two types of farm implements: 1. Five-Inch Irrigation Water Pump: Used for irrigation and drainage. Driven by a 15-horsepower electric motor. 2. Single-Handle Plow: Using one animal, it can plow 8 to 10 mu of land per day.

After these new-style farm implements are manufactured, they are first tested in rural areas and farmer opinions are sought to continuously improve them. Among these farm implements, the Liberation Cultivator is produced in the largest quantity, with more than 2,000 units produced in the past six months. They are mostly sold to Zhangjiakou, Rehe, and central Hebei.

At the Industrial Exhibition, how affectionate and fond the farmer representatives are when they see these new-style farm implements! On the two days of the pre-exhibition, several farmer representatives were overjoyed when they saw the new-style farm implements, as if they had discovered a miracle, saying: "We came to visit thinking we would see big machines, but we didn't expect to see these good things. The old gadgets in the village should be replaced." They immediately spread the news to the farmer reception center in the World Building. Hundreds of Hebei farmer representatives were stirred up. On the day the Industrial Exhibition opened, they spent the vast majority of their time visiting these new-style farm implements. They patiently stroked them one by one. The huge and complex tractor painted in vermilion red (foreign product, but the plow, harrow, etc. pulled by the machine can be made domestically) aroused great interest among the farmer representatives. One said: "It would be great to have one in every county." Another said: "It would be great to have one in every village." The instructors explained the performance of various farm implements, but still could not satisfy everyone's demands; everyone wanted to see everything thoroughly. The instructors patiently disassembled almost every farm implement. The farmer representatives looked carefully and asked repeatedly; some people even asked about a small screw to understand why it was this size, and then carefully recorded the performance introduced by the instructors in their notebooks. According to the requirements of the farmer representatives, the instructors demonstrated each farm implement that could be demonstrated: the chaff cutter was operating at high speed, the seed cleaner selected seeds very evenly..., and the farmer representatives expressed great satisfaction. Because individuals cannot afford to buy them, the instructors told everyone to organize, and the government can lend to everyone and pay in installments. Hearing this, the representatives were extremely happy and said: "Use (buy)! Absolutely use!"

The farmer representatives also put forward their opinions frankly on the farm implements with shortcomings. For example, some representatives believed that according to the tillage characteristics of Hebei Province, the row spacing of the ten-row seeder was too close, which hindered crop growth, and it should be changed to five rows, which could also reduce labor and materials and reduce costs. For the single-handle plow, the farmer representatives suggested adding a handle in the middle of the handle to make it easier to lift and turn; a wheel should be added behind the iron hook for the livestock to control the depth when plowing.... They wrote their hopes for the mechanization of agriculture in the new China in the opinion solicitation book. Liu Zenxun said: "The quality has reached a rising level, and we should strive for more production in quantity so that every farmer has a machine." Another representative said: "I hope that all agricultural machinery will develop to every corner of the country."

They visited from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m., a total of four hours, and some people were still reluctant to leave. Some people heard that the Beijing General Factory of the factory also had new-style farm implements and proposed organizing a tour group to visit; some people proposed bringing several tractors from the Beijing General Factory to demonstrate cultivation.

    提高农业生产的利器
    天津工展新式农具介绍
    维进
    在天津工展会上，华北国营农业机械总厂出产的一批新式农具，对于补救农村劳动力的缺乏，具有极其重大的意义。许多农民代表把这些新式农具称为提高农业生产的一支生力军，实在并不夸口，这些新式农具的确是提高农业生产的利器。
    这些新式农具，无论从效能或用途上说，都比旧式农具强好多倍。这里有仿造苏联型式制造的七种农具：一、十行播种机。用两头牲口，每日可播五十亩至六十亩，用拖拉机曳引，每日可播二百亩至二百五十亩。一次可以播十行。自动开沟下种。种子装在箱内，沿布管落入穴中。种籽大小、行间疏密、开沟深浅、下种多少，均可自由调节。不用时将开沟之圆碟升起，行动极为方便。机后带有铁环链，用以覆土，深浅松紧，均甚适度。二、铡草机：是铡谷草喂牲口用的。用一个人或一马力电动机的动力每小时可以铡草两千斤左右；动作飞速，比旧式铡草刀快十倍。三、双把犁，用一头牲口可以拉动，每天可耕地八亩到十亩。前面附有犁刀，以破硬土并截断蔓草。凡杂草丛生之地，用此犁耕后，杂草可全部埋在土里，发生绿肥效能。耕后沟槽平整，利于作物生长。四、带轮犁，用以耕田及开垦荒地。驾驶轻便，用两头牲口，一次耕地宽十二英寸，每天可耕十五亩至二十亩。犁尖锋锐，荒地草地硬地用此犁最为适宜，深耕时效果更好。五、割草机，专割牧草或禾类作物。用两头牲口每天可剪割五十亩。人坐在机座上，驾驶前进时，刀片往复抽动，草茎在流线型锯齿间通过时，即被剪断。六、精选机，用以精选种籽清理谷粒。用一马力电动机或用人力，每小时可选种三百斤。小麦、高粱、谷子、豆类等，经此机处理，泥沙皮屑彻底清除，选出种籽颗粒大小均匀。七、搂草机，用以收集割下的牧草，或农作物。用牲口二头，每天收百亩左右。一人可以驾驶，比用人力收获省时在十倍以上。草原牧畜地带用之最宜。
    从旧式农具改造的有九种：一、解放式中耕器，可以锄地、除草、培土。用一头牲口每日可锄地二十五亩到三十亩。此器附有各种铲刀，可变换十种不同的形式，适合各种作物使用。二、小型点播机，用以播种。一人一日可播种五亩至八亩。比手工点种便利十倍。盛种籽的地方，有十三种大小不同的小孔，以适应大小不同的种籽。三、五齿中耕器，用以锄地除草培土。用一头牲口每日可锄地二十五亩至三十亩。比旧式锄地法节省人工至少十倍。此器有五齿，前后均匀，耙土细碎，深浅适度，除草干净，并可向两边培土。四、玉米脱粒机，专门剥玉米。人力手摇，每小时可剥玉米一百五十斤。比人工手剥或用刮板快十倍。五、皮辘轧花机，用一匹马力电动机，每小时能轧皮棉廿八斤。六、三级式高压水泵，用以灌溉排水。以十五马力电动机的动力，可向高地灌溉或工厂水塔灌水。每小时出水一百吨。七、脱粒机，为谷类作物脱粒之用。电力人力两用。每小时能脱粒二百斤。八、拖拉犁，用以耕地。以十二马力拖粒机拖带，每小时能种地六亩。九、打稻机，为稻子脱粒用之。人力脚踏，每小时能脱粒三百斤。
    华北农业机械总厂自己发明的有两种：一、五英寸灌溉水泵，用以灌溉排水。用十五马力电动机带动。二、单把犁，用牲口一头，每天可耕地八亩至十亩。
    这些新式农具制成后，都是先在乡间实验，并征求农民意见，不断改进。这些农具中以解放中耕器出产最多，半年来出产二千余部。多行销张家口、热河、冀中等地。

    在工展会上，农民代表看见这些新式农具，怎样亲切和喜爱呵！二日预展这天，有几位农民代表看见新式农具时，象发现奇迹似的高兴说：“心里想着来参观就是看看大机器，想不到还有这些好东西，村里的旧家伙该换换了。”他们马上把这个消息传到世界大楼农民招待所。几百个河北农民代表都轰动起来。工展揭幕那天，他们以绝大部分时间参观了这些新式农具。他们耐心的，一件一件抚摸着。漆成朱红色的庞大复杂的拖拉机（外货。但该机曳引之犁、耙等能自造），引起农民代表极大的兴趣。这个说：“一个县有一个就好了。”那个说：“一个村有一个就好了。”说明员尽管在那里解释各种农具的性能，还不能满足大家的要求；大家要求看个透澈。说明员耐心地几乎把每一种农具都拆卸开来。农民代表们仔细地看着，反复地问着；有些人连一根小螺丝都要问清楚为什么要这样大小的尺寸，然后才慎重地把说明员所介绍的性能记在本子里。说明员按照农民代表的要求，又把每一种可能表演的农具逐一表演：铡草机在飞速地动作，精选机选种十分均匀……，农民代表都表示非常满意。因为个人购买不起，说明员告诉大家组织起来，政府可以贷给大家，分期付款。这样一说，代表们都高兴极了，说：“用（买）！绝对用！”
    农民代表对于有缺点的农具也不客气的提出意见。如十行播种机，有些代表认为按照河北省耕作特点，行间距离太近，妨碍作物生长，应该改为五行，这样还能减工省料，降低成本。对于单把犁，农民代表建议在柄的中部添一手提的把，提起转动省力；架牲口的铁勾后边，应该加上一个轱辘，犁起来才能掌握深浅……。他们在征求意见的簿子上，写着对于新中国农业机器化的希望。刘增勋说：“在质量上已达到上升水平，在数量上应力求多产，使每一家农民都有一架机器。”另一代表说：“希望一切农业机械发展到国家的每一个角落。”
    他们从上午十时参观到下午二时，共参观四个钟头，还有些人依恋地不愿离开。有些人听说该厂的北京总厂还有新式农具，提议组织参观团去参观；有些人提议把北京总厂的拖拉机开来几部表演耕作。
