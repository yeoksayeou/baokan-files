　　Henan Rushes Autumn Planting of Wheat
　　Government Loans Over 9 Million Catties of Grain and Seeds

　　[Reported by this newspaper] Henan Province has largely completed the autumn harvest and is now carrying out autumn planting of wheat and mobilizing people in disaster areas for production and disaster preparedness. The Henan Provincial People's Government and various special district offices have successively loaned over 9.5 million catties of wheat seeds and food grains and have distributed a large amount of relief grain and funds in disaster areas. The Provincial Government has decided to reduce and exempt disaster areas from the autumn public grain burden of 9.2 million catties, and allocate 300,000 catties of grain to help poor farmers in the Xihua County Yellow River flooded area build houses, settle down, and engage in production. Under the slogans of "One wheat crop equals three seasons" and "Plant more wheat early to prevent famine," farmers in various places are actively engaged in mutual assistance in production to expand wheat planting areas. Lingbao and Wenxiang counties have planted 500,000 mu of wheat. Zhengyang County has reclaimed over 7,000 mu of wasteland, increasing the wheat planting area by 25% compared to previous years. People's governments at all levels throughout the province are now leading farmers to rush autumn planting and prepare for disaster prevention in the coming spring.

　　河南突击秋耕种麦
  　政府贷粮种九百余万斤
    【本报讯】河南省秋收已大体完成，目前正进行秋耕种麦和动员灾区人民生产备荒。河南省人民政府及各专署已先后贷发麦种贷粮九百五十余万斤，并在灾区发放了大量救济粮款。省政府已决定减免各灾区秋季公粮负担九百二十万斤，并拨粮三十万斤，帮助西华县黄泛区贫苦农民建屋安家，进行生产。各地农民在“一麦顶三季”、“多种麦子早防荒”的口号下，纷纷进行生产互助，扩大种麦面积。灵宝、阌乡两县已种麦五十万亩。正阳县开荒七千余亩，种麦面积较往年增加百分之二十五。全省各级人民政府现正领导农民，全力突击秋耕和进行明春防备灾荒的准备工作。
