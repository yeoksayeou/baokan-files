Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 23rd: Due to the victorious advance of the People's Liberation Army in the Southwest, Northwest, and South China, the few remaining important nests of the Kuomintang remnant bandit gangs in the Southwest have fallen into a state of chaos. The remnant bandits who had just fled from Guangzhou to Chongqing are now fleeing towards Kunming and Chengdu. However, the Chengdu remnant bandits are already making "emergency preparations," and wooden fences and bunkers are being hastily built on the city's main streets. The People's Liberation Army's capture of Guiyang has cut off the Chongqing remnant bandits' land escape route to the south. Those high-ranking Kuomintang bureaucrats and politicians who are eager to escape are desperately buying tickets from Chennault's Flying Tigers, leading to a rampant black market for plane tickets, with each ticket costing as much as ten gold bars. As for the Kuomintang's middle and lower-level civil servants, according to the bandit gang's Central News Agency, the following policy has been adopted: "Government employees, except for a portion who will accompany us, will either be ordered to participate in military work or be dismissed, choosing one of the two." "The entire plan for withdrawal, streamlining, and simplification of administration has already been decided in yesterday's (21st) meeting of the Vice Ministers of the Executive Yuan's various ministries and commissions... The Central Bank's head office will reduce its 400 employees to 75, and the rest will be laid off."

　　重庆成都残匪慌乱
    【新华社北京二十三日电】由于人民解放军在西南、西北、华南的胜利发展，国民党残余匪帮在西南寥寥可数的几个重要巢穴，又已陷于混乱状态。才从广州逃到重庆的残匪，已在逃往昆明和成都。但成都残匪也已经在进行“应急准备”，市内大街上正赶筑木栅和碉堡。人民解放军的占领贵阳，切断了重庆残匪向南的陆上逃路，那些急于逃命的国民党高级官僚政客，便拼命抢购陈纳德航空队的飞机票，以致飞机票黑市猖獗，每张价格高达十根金条。至对国民党中下级公务人员，这次，据匪帮的中央社自供，采取了这样方针：“政府公务员除一部随行外，余均听令参加军队工作或遣散，两途中选择其一。”“整个撤员简政之方案，已于昨（二十一）日政院各部会次长会报中有所决定……中央银行总行四百行员将减为七十五人，余均资遣。”
