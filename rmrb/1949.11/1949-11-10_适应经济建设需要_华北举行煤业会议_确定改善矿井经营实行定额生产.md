　　To Meet the Needs of Economic Construction
    North China Holds Coal Industry Conference
  　Determines Improvement of Mine Management and Implementation of Production Quotas
    [Our Newspaper] The North China Coal Industry Cadre Conference, lasting eight days, closed yesterday (the 9th). Attendees included representatives from the Fengfeng Mining Bureau, Jingxing-Yangquan Mining Bureau, Jiaozuo Mining Bureau, Datong Mining Bureau, and Lu'an Coal Mine, as well as representatives from the Jingxi Coal Mine Company and the Kailuan Coal Mine Military Representative Delegation, and industrial management cadres from Hebei, Shanxi, Chahar, and Pingyuan provinces as observers. The main purpose of the conference was to determine the North China coal industry's production policy and tasks for 1950, and to formulate annual production and restoration plans. The conference successively heard reports from Vice Chairman Zhu De of the Central People's Government, Vice Director Bo Yibo of the Financial and Economic Committee, Vice Chairman Li Lisan of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and Director Ren Bishao of the North China Coal Mine Administration on the production policy and draft plan for next year. Based on the national situation and the production status of the North China coal industry, extensive discussions were held. The conference first affirmed that since the liberation of North China's state-owned coal mines in 1945, the efforts of workers and cadres have overcome many difficulties, and the work has been successful. Not only has it supplied fuel for industrial production and military and civilian use, but it has also trained a group of mine management cadres and established a foundation for further development in the future. The conference also reviewed some shortcomings that still exist and need to be overcome. These shortcomings are mainly: in the past, in the war environment, too much emphasis was placed on the quantity of production, and not enough attention was paid to the construction of the mines. In some aspects, backward production methods, production management, and technical guidance have not been standardized, resulting in waste and accidents such as underground water, fire, and wind still occurring constantly. In order to meet the requirements of the country's long-term industrial construction, it is necessary to actively study and improve. The conference estimated that the coal demand next year (including North China, Jinan, and Wuhan areas) will be 12 million tons. Therefore, it was determined that the operating policy of North China's state-owned coal mines next year should focus on active restoration and construction, improving technology, and implementing quota production management. Based on the actual situation, it was determined that state-owned coal mines should guarantee the completion of 3.8 million tons of coal production next year, and the remaining 8.2 million tons of coal production and supply can be completed by provincial and private coal mines.

　　适应经济建设需要
    华北举行煤业会议
  　确定改善矿井经营实行定额生产
    【本报讯】华北煤业干部会议，历时八天，已于昨（九日）闭幕。出席者计有峰峰矿务局、井（陉）阳（泉）矿务局、焦作矿务局、大同矿务局、潞安煤矿等五个单位，并有京西煤矿公司、开滦煤矿军事代表团之代表，及河北、山西、察哈尔、平原等省工业管理干部列席参加。会议主要目的为确定一九五○年之华北煤业生产方针任务，制订全年生产计划和修复计划。大会先后听取了中央人民政府朱德副主席，财委会薄一波副主任，中华全国总工会李立三副主席的报告，以及华北煤矿管理局任弼绍局长关于明年生产方针和计划草案的报告。并根据全国形势，和华北煤业生产状况，展开广泛讨论。会议首先肯定华北国营各煤矿自一九四五年先后解放以来由于职工和干部的努力，克服了许多困难，工作是有成绩的，不但供给了工业生产和军需民用的燃料，而且培养了一批管理矿山的干部，建立了今后进一步发展的基础。会议同时也检讨出目前仍存在着的一些缺点，尚待继续克服。这些缺点主要是：过去在战争环境中，过分重视生产数量，对于矿山的建设注意不够。在若干方面表现了生产方法落后，生产管理和技术指导，没有作到正规化标准化，以致浪费现象和井下水火风等事故尚不断发生。为了适应全国长期工业建设的要求，必须积极研究改进。会议估计明年需煤量（包括华北及济南、武汉区）为一千二百万吨。因此确定明年华北国营煤矿经营方针，应以积极的修复建设，改进技术，实行定额生产管理为主。根据实际情况，确定明年国营煤矿应保证完成三百八十万吨煤的生产任务，其余八百二十万吨煤的生产供应，可由省营、私营煤矿完成。
