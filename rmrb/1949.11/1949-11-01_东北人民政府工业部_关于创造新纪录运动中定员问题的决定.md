　　Northeast People's Government Industry Department
  　Decision on the Issue of Staffing in the New Record Creation Movement
    In the new record creation movement, due to the improvement of labor efficiency and the implementation of personnel quota management, many factories and mines will inevitably discover the phenomenon of wasted labor. However, this is only a temporary phenomenon in a specific factory or mine caused by unreasonable labor organization. In terms of the overall industrial situation, we are not currently experiencing a "labor surplus." On the contrary, we urgently need a large number of various employees to supplement various industrial sectors to meet the needs of industrial recovery and development.

    Currently, two incorrect ideas and handling methods that have been discovered in various regions must be corrected. One is that some workers are afraid that after new records are created and labor efficiency is improved, a small number of workers will be laid off and unemployed. Some factory and mine leaders have not only failed to provide correct explanations to dispel the workers' concerns but have also affected themselves by not daring to resolutely implement staffing, thus restricting themselves from better changing unreasonable labor organization and labor utilization, and making it impossible to effectively lead and carry out the new record creation movement. According to this idea, it is impossible to implement economic accounting and run industry well. The other approach is to rashly dismiss and lay off employees, only considering the needs of a single factory at a single moment, without considering the needs of the entire country, or even fully estimating the development of the factory in a year or six months, which puts the creation of new production record movement and the reorganization of staffing in opposition to the workers, having a very bad impact and creating the bad consequence of being divorced from the masses. Both of these phenomena are wrong, and improper handling of this issue will prevent the new record movement from unfolding well. For this reason, it is specifically decided:

    1. All factories and mines must resolutely mobilize the masses to carry out the new record creation movement, and implement staffing work on the basis of this movement. No one shall passively treat this movement under any pretext. At the same time, in the handling of personnel surplus to the new record movement staffing work, it is not allowed to arbitrarily dismiss or lay off employees.

    2. Personnel made surplus to staffing should first be appropriately transferred and adjusted within the scope of each factory, mine, company, and bureau as much as possible, and be given work that suits them. The wages for the new work should be kept at a level that is not lower than the original wages as much as possible. Those that cannot be resolved by each bureau may be submitted to the Industry Department for coordination within the scope of the Industry Department.

    3. At the same time, all units should, according to the different nature of the work, centrally organize various training classes and schools to improve the technical, cultural, and political level of employees, as a national labor reserve. Those who are determined to change careers or transfer to other factories must be given sufficient education and explanation, and the units shall be responsible for introducing them and appropriately transferring them.

    4. Those who engage in sabotage, are incompetent, or violate labor discipline, and should be dismissed, are not within the scope of this decision.

　　东北人民政府工业部
  　关于创造新纪录运动中定员问题的决定
    在创造新纪录运动中，由于劳动效率的提高，和实施人员定额管理的结果，必然会发现许多厂矿有浪费劳动力的现象。但这只是由于劳动力组织不合理所造成的一厂一矿一个时期的现象，而就总的工业情况来说，我们今天还不是“劳动力过剩”，而是相反，我们目前正需要大量的各种职工，补充到各个工业部门，以应工业恢复与发展的需要。
    现各地已经发现的两种不正确的思想与处理方法必须纠正。一种是：某些工友害怕在创造了新纪录，劳动效率提高后，少数工友要被裁汰和失业，而有些厂矿在领导上不仅没有进行正确的解释，打破工友的顾虑，而且影响自己也不敢坚决实行定员，束手束脚，不能更好地改变不合理的劳动组织与劳动力使用，也不可能很好的领导开展新纪录运动。按照这种思想，就不能贯彻经济核算，办好工业。另一种作法则是：轻率解雇，遣散职工，只顾一厂一时，未注意到整个国家的需要，甚至未充分估计到本厂一年半载之后的发展，以致使创造生产新纪录运动，整编定员工作，与工人对立起来，影响很坏，造成脱离群众的恶果。这两种现象都是错误的，不适当地处理这一问题，新纪录运动便不能很好展开。为此特决定：
    一、各厂矿必须坚决发动群众，开展创造新纪录运动，在这一运动的基础上，实行定额工作。不得以任何借口消极对待这一运动。同时，对新纪录运动定额工作编余人员之处理，不准随意遣散解雇。
    二、定额编余人员，应首先就各厂矿、公司、局之范围内尽可能适当调换调整其工作，并使其得到适合于他的工作。新的工作的工资，尽量做到不低于原有工资，各局不能解决者可呈报工业部，在工业部范围内调剂之。
    三、各单位同时应就不同工作性质，分别集中、组织各种训练班学校，提高职工之技术、文化、政治水平，作为国家劳动后备。确定必须转业转厂者，必须进行充分的教育解释后，由各单位负责介绍，适当转业。
    四、有破坏行为，不能称职，违反劳动纪律，理应革职者，不在此决定范围之内。　  十月二十四日
