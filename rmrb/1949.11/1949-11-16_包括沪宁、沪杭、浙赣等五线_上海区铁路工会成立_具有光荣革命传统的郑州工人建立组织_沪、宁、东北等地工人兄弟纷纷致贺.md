　　【Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 15th】The Preparatory Committee of the Zhengzhou Municipal Federation of Trade Unions convened the city's first workers' representative conference at the beginning of this month to formally establish the Zhengzhou Municipal Federation of Trade Unions. Liu Daoan, Director of the Organization Department of the Zhengzhou Municipal Committee of the CPC, and other responsible personnel made special reports at the meeting on "Summary of Trade Union Work in the Past Year and Future Work Guidelines," "Democratic Management of Public Factories," "Conclusion of Collective Contracts between Labor and Capital," and "Implementing the Operation of Trade Unions by Everyone." After the conference adopted the organizational charter of the Zhengzhou Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, it elected Liu Daoan, Li Yuanfang and other 31 people as executive committee members, formally establishing the Zhengzhou Municipal Federation of Trade Unions. The Preparatory Committee of the Central China Federation of Trade Unions and the Preparatory Committee of the Henan Provincial Federation of Trade Unions sent representatives to participate in the conference to celebrate the establishment of their own organization by the Zhengzhou worker brothers with a glorious revolutionary tradition since the "February 7th" strike movement in 1923. Worker brothers and people's organizations from Shanghai, Nanjing, Qiqihar and other cities also presented banners, congratulatory banners and telegrams to express their congratulations. Zhengzhou currently has more than 12,600 trade union members, accounting for more than 30 percent of the city's more than 40,000 workers. Among them, 350 young workers have joined the New Democratic Youth League, and more than 100 outstanding workers have joined the Communist Party of China. At present, the Zhengzhou Municipal Federation of Trade Unions is gradually correcting the closed-doorism and formalism that existed in its past work, in order to further organize the entire working class of the city.
