(Reported by this newspaper) Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The so-called Dutch-Indonesian Round Table Conference held in The Hague on August 23 under the manipulation of U.S. imperialism has largely completed the work of auctioning off Indonesian sovereignty and the interests of the Indonesian people, and has now announced that it will end on November 1. News reports that agreements on the "Organizational Law of the Netherlands-Indonesian Federation," the so-called "withdrawal of Dutch troops," and "transfer of sovereignty to the United States of Indonesia" have been reached in principle. The detailed content of these agreements has not yet been announced, but according to newspaper reports, the agreements basically recognize the "principles of the Renville Agreement," which negate Indonesian national independence. The Hatta reactionary clique agreed to "the Queen of the Netherlands as the symbolic head of the Dutch-Indonesian Federation." On the issue of establishing a "Joint Armed Forces of the United States of Indonesia," the Hatta reactionary clique agreed to accept "assistance" from the Netherlands in weapons and ammunition, and to accept the dispatch of a Dutch military delegation to Indonesia to "help establish and train the Indonesian army." From November 1, the Dutch government will subsidize the Hatta reactionary clique with 600,000 guilders per month for military expenses to arm the so-called "Republican Army" against the Indonesian people. In this way, Dutch imperialism has, through the "cooperation" of the Hatta reactionary clique, seized control of the reactionary army attacking the Indonesian people.

According to an Associated Press dispatch from The Hague on the 25th: The actual commander of the conference, U.S. representative Cochran, who attended the so-called "United Nations Commission for Indonesia," has personally come forward to form a special mixed committee of four with representatives from the Netherlands, Indonesia, and the "Federalists" (including representatives of various puppet states outside of Yogyakarta) to resolve the two issues that have not yet been agreed upon. One is that the Netherlands insists that the Indonesian Republic must bear the colonial war expenses of approximately 6.1 billion guilders (equivalent to $1.586 billion as of the end of this year) incurred by the Netherlands in Indonesia. The Dutch side also demands that, in order to guarantee Indonesia's obligation to fulfill this huge "national debt," the Dutch government must enjoy "the right to speak" in Indonesia's future fiscal and economic policies. The Yogyakarta reactionary clique, headed by Hatta, has agreed in principle to recognize this huge "national debt," but fearing opposition from the people, has not fully accepted it on the surface and hopes to reduce it. The other unresolved issue is the status of New Guinea. The Netherlands firmly insists that Dutch New Guinea should not be included in "the scope of the United States of Indonesia," while Hatta demands that New Guinea be part of the Republic's territory. The U.S. supports Hatta's demand because the U.S. hopes to establish its military bases in New Guinea through the rule of the Hatta clique. However, the Netherlands' position is supported by Britain and Australia, which fear that the U.S. invasion of New Guinea will endanger their own interests.

The Hatta reactionary clique's act of selling out the interests of the Indonesian people at the Round Table Conference in The Hague has aroused widespread anger among the Indonesian people. People's guerrillas operating in Java and Sumatra have recently been actively engaged in attacking Dutch colonialists. Even some of the troops controlled by the Sukarno-Hatta government have risen up against the Sukarno-Hatta clique's treacherous behavior. According to a TASS report, parts of the Indonesian Republic's army in West Java have refused to carry out the Hatta government's orders and have decided to continue the war against the Dutch aggressors. In East Java, Dutch colonial authorities admit that a strong force of the Republican Army has notified the Indonesian Republic government that it is no longer bound by the "ceasefire order." The Indonesian people are striving to take the destiny of Indonesian national independence into their own hands.

### 荷印“圆桌会议”即将结束  哈达无耻接受卖国条件  印尼游击队及共和军积极出击

    荷印“圆桌会议”即将结束
    哈达无耻接受卖国条件
    印尼游击队及共和军积极出击
    【本报讯】据新华社电讯：八月二十三日在海牙召开的在美帝国主义操纵下的所谓荷印圆桌会议，大体上已完成了拍卖印尼主权和印尼人民利益的工作，现已宣布定于十一月一日结束。消息称：会议关于“荷兰—印尼联邦组织法”，关于所谓“荷军撤退”及“移交主权给印尼合众国”等问题，已在原则上获得协议。这些协议的详细内容尚未公布，据报纸透露的消息，协议在基本上承认了取消印尼民族独立的“伦维尔协定的原则”。哈达反动集团同意“以荷兰女王为荷印联邦的象征元首”。在建立“印尼合众国联合军”问题上，哈达反动集团同意接受荷兰武器与弹药的“援助”，接受荷兰派遣军事代表团驻在印尼，“帮助建立与训练印尼军队”。荷兰政府自十一月一日起，每月补助哈达反动集团六十万盾军费，以武装反印尼人民的所谓“共和军”。这样，荷兰帝国主义就通过哈达反动集团的“合作”，掌握了进攻印尼人民的反动军队。
    据美联社海牙二十五日讯：会议的实际指挥者出席所谓“联合国印尼委员会”的美国代表科契伦，已亲自出马，与荷兰、印尼及“联邦派”（包括日惹政府以外的各傀儡邦代表）三方面的代表各一人，组成四人特别混合委员会，以解决迄今尚未获得协议的两个问题。一个是荷兰坚持印尼共和国必须承担荷兰在印尼支出的殖民地战争费用约六十一亿盾（截至今年年底为止，合十五亿八千六百万美元）。荷方并要求，为了保证印尼执行这一巨额“国债”的义务，荷政府必须在印尼未来的财政经济政策中享有“发言权”。以哈达为首的日惹反动集团，原则上已同意承认这笔巨额“国债”，但恐怕遭受人民的反对，表现上还没有完全接受，希望予以减少。另一个未获协议的问题，是关于新几内亚的地位问题。荷兰坚主荷属新几内亚不应列入“印尼合众国的范围之内”，而哈达则要求新几内亚作为共和国领土的一部分。美方支持哈达的要求，因为美国希望通过哈达集团的统治，在新几内亚建立它的军事基地。但荷兰的主张却获得英国与澳洲的支持，它们害怕美国侵入新几内亚，将危及它们自己的利益。
    哈达反动集团在海牙圆桌会议出卖印尼人民利益的行为，已引起印尼人民普遍的愤怒。在爪哇与苏门答腊活动的人民游击队，最近曾积极出动，袭击荷兰殖民者。甚至苏加诺、哈达政府控制下的一部分军队，也起来反对苏、哈集团的卖国行为。据塔斯社报道，西爪哇部分的印尼共和国的军队，已拒绝执行哈达政府的命令，决定继续进行反对荷兰侵略者的战争。在东爪哇，荷兰殖民地当局承认，共和军某一劲旅已通知印尼共和国政府，它已不再受“停战令”的约束。印尼人民正在努力斗争，把印尼民族独立的命运，掌握在他们自己的手里。
