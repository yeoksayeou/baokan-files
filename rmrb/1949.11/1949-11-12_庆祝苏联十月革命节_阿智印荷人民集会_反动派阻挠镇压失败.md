Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 10th. According to reports from the Associated Press and Agence France-Presse: The reactionary authorities in Argentina and Chile have actually arrested and shot at masses who enthusiastically held rallies and demonstrations in the capitals of both countries to celebrate the 32nd anniversary of the October Revolution.

On the 5th of this month, the people of the Argentine capital gathered in Buenos Aires to celebrate the 32nd anniversary of the great October Revolution. This gathering had been permitted by the Argentine government. However, when the meeting began, the police, using the excuse of "non-compliance with public order regulations," attempted to disband it. This reactionary measure was met with strong resistance from the masses attending the meeting. The police then carried out large-scale arrests, and 705 people have been imprisoned, including Codovilla, the chairman of the Argentine Communist Party. Regarding this matter, the Argentine Communist Party issued a protest on the 7th, denouncing the reactionary authorities' shameless and criminal actions.

At the same time, in Santiago, the capital of Chile, people were shot at by police for holding demonstrations celebrating the 32nd anniversary of the October Revolution. More than ten people were injured, and at least one hundred were arrested. Hours after this violent incident, the police also attacked the headquarters of the Construction Workers' Union in Santiago. According to the police, five people were injured for resisting arrest, and six were arrested during this attack.

One of the leaders of the Dutch Communist Party, Member of Parliament Hoekstra, delivered a speech at a conference in Amsterdam, the capital of the Netherlands. He called on the Dutch working people to strengthen their friendship with the Soviet Union and intensify the struggle for peace. The audience erupted in stormy applause, congratulating Stalin and the Soviet people.
