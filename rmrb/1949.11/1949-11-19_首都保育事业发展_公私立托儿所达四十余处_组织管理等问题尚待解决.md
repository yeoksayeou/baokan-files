　　Development of Childcare in the Capital
    Over Forty Public and Private Nurseries Established
  　Organizational Management and Other Issues Awaiting Resolution
    [Our Newspaper's Report] Since the liberation of Beijing, the children's childcare cause has progressed rapidly. According to statistics, there are currently a total of forty-two public and private nurseries in the city, ten of which existed before liberation, and six of which were relocated from the old liberated areas (Los Angeles Nursery, May Fourth Nursery, Communications School Nursery, Rongzhen Kindergarten, etc.). The rest were newly established after the arrival of various organs in the city, such as the Beihai Experimental Nursery, the Central Committee of the Youth League, the Finance Committee, the Ministry of Communications, the Supply and Marketing Cooperative, the Ministry of Railways, and the All-China Women's Federation Kindergarten. At present, the total number of children accommodated in the forty-two nurseries has reached more than 1,800.
    These nurseries have established certain relationships with the Beijing Municipal Women's Federation. Since its establishment on August 1st this year, the Children's Welfare Department of the Beijing Municipal Women's Federation has regarded promoting the city's children's childcare cause as its most central task. They first conducted a preliminary understanding of the childcare institutions in the city and carried out key detailed investigations. At the same time, with the assistance of the All-China Women's Federation, they connected childcare workers who had previously had no contact with each other, and held a symposium for childcare workers to conduct research and discuss issues such as maternal love in nurseries, working hours for caregivers, the age of children entering nurseries, and the integration of care and education, which strongly promoted the cause of nurseries in Beijing.
    From the current development of the nursery cause in Beijing, there are several issues that need to be raised for research.
    First, the issue of promoting democracy in the organizational structure and management of nurseries. At present, the leadership of private nurseries sometimes consists of only one director or principal, sometimes a board of directors is established, and sometimes a trustee is appointed; however, in terms of administrative leadership, it is generally individual leadership, so democracy cannot be fully promoted. The organization of public nurseries is sometimes relatively sound, such as having a general assembly and a office meeting system, while others are not sound. Moreover, because all work and systems are carried out in the process of exploration and experimentation, there is a lack of experience in promoting democracy and improving management. Therefore, how to achieve full democracy in the management of both public and private nurseries, so that every staff member can better exert their work enthusiasm and be responsible for the children, is indeed a question worth studying and solving.
    Second, the funding of nurseries is a universal problem. Due to the war period, there are naturally many difficulties in terms of material conditions. Private nurseries, due to their relatively tight funding, charge relatively high fees, which makes it difficult for general working women to send their children to the nurseries. In the future, efforts should be made to mobilize and organize possible material and financial resources from all aspects to promote the children's childcare cause.
    Third, the issue of childcare education in nurseries. At present, China's childcare cause has not yet formed a set of scientific methods. In terms of care, uniform regulations have not yet been made on the nutrition of children of various ages based on China's current social living standards and material conditions. In terms of education, due to the differences in the political quality and ideology of caregivers, it is not yet possible to effectively improve their sense of responsibility and improve the methods of care and education.
    The proper resolution of these problems will effectively organize manpower and material resources from all aspects to jointly promote the nursery cause of the new China, so that the nursery cause of the new China can be better developed.

### 首都保育事业发展  公私立托儿所达四十余处　组织管理等问题尚待解决

　　首都保育事业发展
    公私立托儿所达四十余处
  　组织管理等问题尚待解决
    【本报讯】北京解放以来，儿童保育事业进展迅速。据统计，全市现有公私立托儿所共四十二处，其中有十处是解放前的，有六处是从老解放区迁来的（洛杉矶托儿所、五四托儿所、通讯学校托儿所、荣臻幼稚园等），其余的多为机关进城后新创办的，如北海实验托儿所、青年团中央、财委会、交通部、供销处、铁道部、全国妇联幼稚园等。目前四十二处托儿所的儿童收容总数已达一千八百余人。
    这些托儿所与北京市妇联都已建立了一定的关系。北京市妇联儿童福利部自今年八月一日成立后，就把推进本市儿童保育事业当作最中心的工作。她们首先对本市保育机关进行了初步的了解，并进行了重点详细的调查。同时，在全国妇联的协助下，将过去互不往来的儿童保育事业工作者联系起来，并召开了保育事业工作者座谈会，进行研究，讨论了托儿所的母爱问题，保育员工作时间、孩子入所年龄以及保教合一等问题，予北京托儿所事业以有力推动。
    从目前北京市托儿所事业的发展状况来看，有几个问题是需要提出来加以研究的。
    第一、托儿所的组织机构与管理上发扬民主的问题。目前私立托儿所的领导，有的只有一个所长或院长，有的是设董事会，有的则是委托人；但在行政领导方面，一般是个人领导，因此不能充分发扬民主。公立托儿所的组织，有的虽然比较健全，如有全体大会、所务会等制度，有的则不健全，而且因为一切工作与制度都是在摸索实验中进行，对发扬民主改善管理也缺乏经验，因此，不论公私托儿所的管理，如何能够做到充分发扬民主，使托儿所的每个人员都能更好地发挥工作积极性，对儿童负责，确实是很值得研究与解决的问题。
    第二、托儿所的经费是一个普遍的问题。因在战争期中，物质条件方面自然存在着许多困难。私立托儿所则因经费的比较紧，收费比较高，这使一般职业妇女送孩子入所很感困难。今后应设法从各方面动员组织可能的物力财力来推广儿童保育事业。
    第三、托儿所的保育教育问题。目前中国保育事业还未能形成一套科学办法，在保的方面，尚未根据中国目前社会的生活水平，物质条件，对各种年龄儿童的营养作出统一的规定。教的方面，因保育人员政治质量与思想的差异，还不能有效地提高他们的工作责任心和改善保教的方法。
    这些问题的适当解决，将会有效地组织各方面的人力物力，共同推进新中国的托儿事业，使新中国的托儿事业得到更好的发展。
