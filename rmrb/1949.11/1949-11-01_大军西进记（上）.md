　　Record of the Western Advance of the Great Army (Part 1)
　　Luo Libin, Deputy Political Commissar of the 192nd Division
    After the liberation of Lanzhou and Xining, and the main force of Ma Bufang's bandit army was annihilated, liberating Ningxia and annihilating the main force of Ma Hongkui's bandit army became the main key to completely liberating the Northwest and thoroughly annihilating the remnants of the Northwest reactionaries. The internal ranks of the Ma bandits, under the powerful offensive of our army, immediately wavered, fell into chaos, and disintegrated. The following is a summary of the Ningxia Hedong Campaign that we personally experienced.

　　I. The Great March

    When the news came that our fraternal troops in Gansu and Qinghai provinces, with extraordinary courage and perseverance, had crossed the snow-capped mountains and deserts and were heading for the Xinjiang border, we also marched north to Ningxia from Guyuan on the border of Gansu and Ningxia in continuous rain and muddy roads, with joy and a competitive spirit. It rained all day, and the soldiers used straw hats, towels, and dry clothes to protect their ammunition and dry food. People often slipped and fell, and others helped them up while laughing heartily; sometimes, when the road ahead was difficult, the rows behind moved slowly while singing loudly, and inadvertently, rainwater flowed into their mouths. When passing through villages, the villagers often poked their heads out of their doorways, looking at us in surprise, and said, "It's raining so hard, and the road is so difficult to travel, comrades, it's really hard work!" The answer they heard was always: "In order to liberate Ningxia and eliminate Ma Hongkui's bandit army as soon as possible, a little hardship is nothing!"

    It didn't rain on the second and third days, but the road was still very difficult to travel; and the further we went, the more desolate it became, often without any houses or crops for twenty or thirty li. Some people said, "This is comparable to the Red Army's Long March of 25,000 li. Look, haven't we arrived at the uninhabited grasslands?" Someone retorted him: "How can that compare? We've only been walking for a few days! The Long March lasted for several months!" The campsites were mostly "open-air camps." The cooks set up marching pots in the open fields, and people untied their rice bags and poured the grain into the pots. Someone said, "After all, the superiors made a thorough estimate. If we hadn't carried eight days of food with us, we would have really had to drink the northwest wind these days!"

    When a certain company camped, the instructor told everyone, "We don't need to go to the river to fetch bitter water here. The villagers have cellar water, but be careful not to use it all up, and leave half for the villagers to use in the future." People happily carried buckets and followed the villagers to fetch "cellar water." The villager said with a smile, "The People's Liberation Army is really lucky. There was a lot of rain this year, and our cellars are full. Otherwise, let alone so many of you coming with nothing to drink, even we would be drinking bitter water from the Qingshui River. ... You won't be able to drink it, you'll definitely get diarrhea."

    From Qiying to Tongxin City is more than one hundred li, and the "Qingshui River" flows from north to south. The east of the river is Ningxia, and the west belongs to Gansu. The water is like mud, turbid and red, and its upstream is called "Kushui Gully," and the river water is salty and bitter. The local people have dug cellars in every house to store water when it rains, which becomes a very precious drink.

    A cavalry regiment of Ma bandits was stationed in Tongxin City, but they fled before we arrived. We only ate one meal a day and traveled more than 130 li to reach the vicinity of Zhongning. The enemy's 81st Army, which was originally stationed in Zhongning, also retreated to the west of the Yellow River. After resting for a few days in continuous rain, in order to detour and cut off the retreat of the defending enemy in Jinji and to cooperate with the fraternal troops advancing from Qinglong Gorge to capture Jinji, we detoured to Gunquan. On September 19, we passed through more than 140 li of uninhabited places, without water or firewood. People only opened their burning throats during the midday rest and swallowed dry food, and then continued to move forward excitedly. At this time, two cavalry regiments of Ma bandits were active on our right side all day long, constantly harassing our army's advance. We fought and marched, sending small units to drive them away, while the main force continued to advance. In the vicinity of Wuzhong Fort south of Jinji, as well as around Lingwu City, there were crisscrossing canals, and lakes and paddy fields were connected together. Walking and fighting often meant sinking knee-deep in mud and neck-deep in water. Some people jokingly said, "This place is really strange. When you need water, it's hard to find a drop, but when you don't need it, it's everywhere." From the afternoon of the 18th, starting from the vicinity of Zhongning, until the chasing troops reached the Rencun ferry on the evening of the 21st, for three days and four nights, we rushed day and night, marching day and night, fighting all the time, regardless of the terrain and weather, and ignoring fatigue and hunger. Finally, we traveled more than 300 li (including detours), did our best to catch up with, seize, intercept, and annihilate the enemy, and quickly liberated the vast area east of the Yellow River in Ningxia, and promoted the resolution of the entire Ningxia.

　　II. The Pursuit and Annihilation Battle

    Around dusk on the 19th, I advanced to the line of Shaqushaozi, Houjiawan, Yanjiawan, and Gaozhaizi southeast of Jinji. Because we were not familiar with the enemy's situation and the terrain, we confronted the enemy across the Han Canal. The Ma bandits destroyed all the bridges in this area and opened the dams from the direction of Qinglong Gorge, introducing the Yellow River water to irrigate several large canals, and connecting the nearby lakes and paddy fields into one piece, forming a virtual swamp. They thought they could rely on the water to prevent or delay our army's offensive, in order to delay their dying fate. At this time, a certain unit on my left flank was only about one li away from the enemy defending Xujiawan, and it was decided to capture Xujiawan and annihilate the defending enemy around dawn on the 20th. The 9th Company of that unit was first ordered to continuously capture three strongholds including Xujiawan, adopting methods such as sharp insertion and division, cutting off fleeing enemies, encirclement and breakthrough, and firepower pursuit, traversing water canals and rice paddies. Some people fell, and immediately got up; some people's shoes were trapped in the mud, so they chased barefoot, and fought all the way to Majia Bridge, two li away from the city, annihilating an enemy battalion headquarters and a company, and capturing more than 100 people alive. The 3rd Company of that unit rushed all the way to the edge of Jinji City, and the remaining enemies retreated into the city in droves. The 3rd Squad of that company, with only seven people, defeated an enemy company by means of fierce pursuit, sharp insertion, on-site shouting, and captured more than 40 people alive, without any casualties. Although my right-wing troops were in unfavorable terrain, they also attacked to the vicinity of Tianjia Bridge. Because there was no time to build a bridge, many soldiers jumped into the water canal, the water was neck-deep, and only their heads were exposed, but they still advanced step by step under the cover of our superior firepower, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy and capturing a part of them. At noon, the main force of the Ma bandits' 356th Division escaped and shrank into the city. I had already controlled the outer periphery southeast of Jinji and was preparing to deploy an attack on the city. However, in order to cut off the escape route of the fleeing enemies, my unit was ordered to hand over the task of encirclement and attack to the friendly forces on the left, detour through Liaojia Bridge and Yangma Lake, and directly attack Wuzhong Fort. On the way, we joined forces with the friendly forces on the right and launched an attack on Wuzhong Fort in separate directions.

    The main force of the Ma bandits' 3rd Security Division relied on the Qingshui Gully (south of Wuzhong Fort, more than one zhang deep and wide), deployed along the north of the canal, and dispersed and firmly defended the fortresses in the villages south of Wuzhong Fort. My vanguard troops arrived near Luoyang Bridge around dusk on the 20th. Before dawn, the 3rd Company of that unit was ordered to build a bridge, and under the firepower of an enemy high bunker and four bunkers, they bravely and stubbornly made repeated efforts. The soldiers of that company, some of whom were wounded four times but still insisted on fighting, finally built the bridge for the fourth time and occupied the enemy's bridgehead fortress, allowing the main force to cross the river safely. After that, I fiercely inserted into the outer perimeter of the enemy defending Wuzhong Fort in separate directions, ignoring the flanking attacks of a few enemy bunkers, and directly attacked the enemy's heart. Military strikes and political offensives, frontal attacks and flanking detours, courage and technology, tenacity and resourcefulness were closely combined. After several hours of fierce fighting, the enemy's entire line of defense was finally destroyed, and the entire depth was disrupted. The 7th Company of a certain unit of mine, because the coordination of infantry and artillery, mutual assistance on the battlefield, the combination of firepower blasting and assault were well done, successively captured four fortresses, annihilated an enemy regiment headquarters and another battalion, captured more than 170 people alive, and seized 14 light and heavy machine guns, and more than 450 rifles, but did not suffer any casualties. The 6th Squad of the 1st Company of that unit bravely and cleverly captured an enemy platoon, and the squad leader of the 7th Squad completed the blasting task twice, completely annihilating an enemy platoon (including a deputy battalion commander and a company commander) who stubbornly resisted our army in Ma Jianyin. At noon, a certain unit on my left wing took advantage of the situation and first occupied Wuzhong Fort. After the 8th Company of that unit inserted into the enemy's depth, the 7th Company quickly inserted into the northeast corner of Wuzhong Fort to block the fleeing enemies, capturing more than 70 people alive, without any casualties on my side. At this time, the friendly forces on the right wing also annihilated and captured many enemies in the area east of Wuzhong Fort. The main force of the enemy's 3rd Security Division, together with a part of the 256th Division that came to reinforce from Lingwu, except for a small number who had already crossed the Yellow River westward under the leadership of Lu Zhongliang, the commander of the enemy's 128th Army, and a small number who fled north in a panic when I occupied Wuzhong Fort, the majority were annihilated, and the number captured alive by my unit reached thousands (including two enemy deputy commanders of the National Army, and the results of the friendly forces on the right wing were not counted).

    Then I left a part of my troops in Wuzhong Fort to search for and suppress the remaining enemies, monitor Jinji, maintain order, and keep property, and the main force continued to pursue Lingwu without stopping. When we advanced to more than ten li from Lingwu City, the deputy division commander and political work director of the enemy's 256th Division, as well as the pseudo-Lingwu county magistrate and the representative of the chamber of commerce, came to surrender. Under the eight conditions and principles determined by Chairman Mao, we allowed them to withdraw the troops outside the city to the city for assembly, pending reorganization. I then sent a part of my troops to the east and south of the city, a part to the west of the city, and another part to the north of the city from the west, to encircle and monitor the enemy separately. When I advanced to the suburbs of Lingwu City, the main force of the enemy's 256th Division and the remnants of the 3rd Security Division that had fled north had already crossed the river, and the remaining enemies in the city only had one regiment and two battalions, as well as the headquarters of the 128th Army and the headquarters of the 256th Division, etc., had also begun to collapse or hide, and the division commander and deputy division commander were fleeing. The troops that detoured to the north of the city immediately blocked a part, and then sent a small part directly to Rencun Ferry, more than twenty li northwest of Lingwu, and intercepted eight cars and a part of the fleeing enemy's materials, capturing a total of more than 800 enemies. That unit, from dawn on the 20th to midnight on the 21st, had been marching and fighting except for two or three hours of rest in the area south of Wuzhong Fort. Many units had only eaten one meal, and many communication personnel had not eaten at all. My troops encircling the west of the city, because there were only reeds and dry grass everywhere, and no houses, in order to truly complete the task, endured hunger and cold, and were submerged in the water for half the night. At dawn, the soldiers were all wet and muddy, looking at each other and joking. After midnight, my units entered the city one after another before dawn, collecting weapons, searching for remaining enemies, cleaning up warehouses, and maintaining order. After that, we sent small units to various places in the east and north of the city to collect scattered soldiers and search for large and small groups of bandits, and also achieved many results.

　　大军西进记（上）
    一九二师副政委  罗立斌
    在兰州、西宁获得解放，马步芳匪军主力被歼之后，解放宁夏歼灭马鸿逵匪主力，便成为全部解放大西北，彻底歼灭西北反动派残余的主要关键。马匪内部在我军强大攻势下，立即动摇纷乱，土崩瓦解。现将我们亲历的宁夏河东战役，概述如后。
　　一　大进军
    当甘、青两省我兄弟部队以超人的勇敢和坚毅，越过雪山沙漠，指向新疆边境的消息传来后，我们也怀着愉快和竞赛的心情，在连绵阴雨道路泥泞中，离开甘宁边境的固原，北向宁夏进军。雨整天下着战士们用草帽、手巾、干衣服来保护自己的弹药和干粮。人们经常滑倒，别人一面搀扶他起来，一面哈哈大笑；有时前面道路难走了，后面的行列便一面慢慢的移动，一面高声唱歌，一不经意，雨水便流进嘴里。经过村落的时候，老乡们常常从门口探头出来，一面惊奇的看看我们，一面说：“下这么大的雨，路又这样难走，同志们真是辛苦了啊！”他们听到的回答总是：“我们为了早日解放宁夏，消灭马鸿逵匪军，吃点苦不算什么！”
    第二、第三天雨是不下了，路还是很难走；而且愈走愈显得荒凉了，往往二三十里不见人家，不长庄稼。有人说：“这比得上红军的二万五千里了，你看这不是到了没有人烟的草地吗？”有人反驳他：“那里比得上？咱们这才走了几天？长征的时候走了好几个月哩！”宿营地多半是“露营地”，伙房在野地里支起行军锅，人们把米袋解开，将粮食倒在锅里。有人说：“到底是上级估计周到，要不是每人背了八天粮食来，这几天真要喝西北风了！”
    某连露营时，指导员和大家讲：“这里不用到河里去挑苦水吃，老乡有窖水，但是注意不要打光了，留一半给老乡以后吃用。”人们高兴的提着桶，跟着老乡去取“窖水”，那个老乡笑嘻嘻的说：“真是解放军有福气，今年的雨水特别多，咱们的窖里也满了。要不，别说你们来了那么多人没喝的，连我们也是吃清水河里的苦水哩。……你们喝不惯，非闹肚不行。”
    从七营到同心城一百多里，南北流着“清水河”，河东是宁夏，河西属甘肃，水象泥浆一样，混红得怕人，它的上游叫“苦水沟”，河水又咸又苦。当地群众家家都挖了地窖，下雨时将水储起来，成为非常珍贵的饮料。
    同心城驻的马匪一个骑兵团，我们还没有来到以前便逃窜了。我们一天只吃了一顿饭，走了一百三十余里，赶到中宁附近。原驻中宁的敌八十一军，也退到黄河以西。我们在连日阴雨中休息了几天以后，为了迂回截断金积守敌的退路，配合从青铜峡进军的兄弟部队攻占金积，便绕道滚泉前进。九月十九日我们经过一百四十余里渺无人迹的地方，没有水更没有柴，人们只在中午休息的时候，张开冒着火的嗓子，将干粮咽下肚里，又兴奋的继续前进。这时马匪两个骑兵团，整天活动于我右侧，不时袭扰我军的前进道路，我们边打边走，派小部队去驱逐它们，大部队依然前进。在金积以南吴忠堡附近，以及灵武城周围都是河渠纵横，湖沼稻田连成一片，走路打仗经常泥深陷膝，水深及颈，有些人俏皮的说：“这个地方真奇怪，需要水的时候，一滴也难找，不需要时，却又遍地是水了。”从十八日下午在中宁附近出发起，至二十一日晚追击部队进至仁存渡口止，三天四夜中，我们天天猛赶，昼夜行军，时时打仗，不管地形天候，不顾疲劳饥饿，终于走了三百余里（连同绕道计算），尽力的赶上、抓住、截击与歼灭了敌人，迅速解放了宁夏河东的广大地区，并促成宁夏全境的解决。
　　二　追歼战
    十九日黄昏前后，我进至金积东南沙曲哨子、侯家湾、阎家湾、高栅子一线。由于敌情地形都不太熟悉，隔着汉渠与敌对峙。马匪将这一带的桥梁悉数破坏，并从青铜峡方向决堤开闸，将黄河水引进灌成几道大渠，附近湖沼、稻田连成一片，几成泽国。他们以为可以凭恃着水来阻止或延缓我军进攻，以便延缓其垂死的命运。此时我左翼某部驻地距徐家湾守敌仅里许，决在二十日拂晓前后攻占徐家湾，歼灭守敌。该部九连首先奉命连续攻占徐家湾等三据点，采取猛插分割，腰斩逃敌，包围突破，火力追击等手段，穿越水渠稻田，有些人跌倒了，立即爬起，有些人鞋子陷在泥里，便光着脚追，一直打到距城二里的马家桥歼敌一个营部并一个连，生俘百余人。该部三连一直扑至金积城边，残敌纷纷溃退城内。该连三班仅七个人，以猛追猛插，火线喊话，击溃敌一个连，生俘四十余人。我右翼部队虽在不利的地形下，亦攻至田家桥附近，因为来不及架桥，许多战士跳到水渠里，水深没颈，只露出一个脑袋，依然在我优势火力掩护下节节前进，予敌以重大杀伤，俘获一部。中午，马匪三五六师主力逃缩城内，我已控制金积东南外围，正准备部署攻城。但为切断溃敌逃路，我部又奉命将包围攻击任务交给左路友军，绕道料家桥、养马湖，直插吴忠堡，中途与右路友军会合，分头向吴忠堡攻击前进。
    马匪保三师主力凭借清水沟（在吴忠堡南，深宽各丈余），在渠北一线布防，并在吴忠堡以南各村纵深分散固守堡寨。我先头部队于二十日黄昏进抵洛河桥附近，拂晓前该部三连奉命架桥，在敌一座高碉四个地堡的火力射击下，英勇顽强的再接再厉。该连战士，有四次负伤仍然坚持作战的，终于第四次将桥架成，并占领敌人的桥头堡垒，使主力得以安然渡河。其后，我分路猛插吴忠堡外围守敌，不顾少数敌堡侧击，直捣敌人心腹，军事打击与政治攻势，正面攻击与侧后迂回、勇敢与技术、顽强与机智密切结合，经过数小时激战，终将敌人防线全部摧毁，纵深整个打乱。我某部七连，由于步炮协同、战场互助、火力爆破与突击结合得好，连克四个堡子，歼敌一个团部另一个营，生俘百七十余人，缴获轻重机枪十四挺，步枪四百五十余枝，自己却无一伤亡。该部一连六班勇敢机智地俘敌一个排，七班长又二次完成爆破任务，全歼固守马建营顽抗我军之敌一个排（内副营长、连长各一）。中午，我左翼某部势如破竹，首先进占吴忠堡，该部八连插入敌人纵深后，七连迅速的插至吴忠堡东北角堵截逃敌，生俘七十余名，我无一伤亡。此时右路友军，亦在吴忠堡以东地区，歼俘甚众。敌保三师主力连同从灵武增援之二五六师一部，除少数由敌一二八军长芦忠良率领早已渡黄河西窜，少数在我进占吴忠堡时狼狈北逃外，大部就歼，为我部生俘者即达千人（内敌国民兵副司令二名，右路友军战果未计）。
    接着我留一部兵力于吴忠堡搜剿残敌，监视金积，维护秩序，保管资财，主力毫不停息的又向灵武猛追。至进距灵武城十余里处，敌二五六师副师长、政工处长及伪灵武县长、商会代表等前来求降，我们在毛主席确定的八个条件原则下，允许他们将城外部队撤至城内集结，听候改编。我随即以一部进至城东、城南，一部进至城西，另一部从城西绕到城北，分别包围监视敌人。当我进至灵武城郊时，敌二五六师主力及保三师北窜之残部，已有一部北逃渡河，城内残敌只有一个团另两个营，及一二八军军部、二五六师师部等残部，亦开始溃散或藏匿，师长副师长等在逃。我绕至城北部队当即堵截一部，其后又派出小部直插灵武西北二十余里之任存渡，又截得汽车八辆及一部逃敌物资，共俘敌八百余人。该部从二十日拂晓至二十一日午夜，除在吴忠堡以南地区休息两三小时外，一直在行军战斗中，很多单位只吃了一顿饭，不少通讯人员根本没有吃上饭。我包围城西部队，因遍地汪洋，只有芦苇枯草，没有人家，为了确实完成任务，忍着饥寒，在水里淹了半夜，天明后战士们个个满身湿透满脸泥泞，互相看着，开着玩笑。午夜后我各部于拂晓前先后进入城内，收缴武器，搜容残敌，清理仓库，维护秩序。其后，我们又派小部队到城东、城北各地，收容散兵游勇，搜捕大小股匪，亦获得不少成绩。
