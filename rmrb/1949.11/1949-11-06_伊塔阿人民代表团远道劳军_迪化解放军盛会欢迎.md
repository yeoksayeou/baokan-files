Xinhua News Agency, Dihua, 5th—The delegation of the people of the three districts of Ili, Tacheng, and Altay (Ita A), which is visiting to offer comfort to the People's Liberation Army, includes: Delegation leader Aisihaiti (Secretary-General of the Yining District Commissioner's Office, member of the Central Organization Committee of the New League, a Tatar); delegation members Resulov (Deputy Commander of the National Army and Director of the Supply Department, an Uzbek), Weigursagailani (member of the Central Organization Committee of the New League, a Uighur), Nusuphhan (Chief of the Cadre Section of the National Army Headquarters, a Mongol), and Chen Xihua (chief writer of the New League's newspaper "Democracy", member of the Central Organization Committee of the New League, a Han). They arrived in Dihua on October 28th, bringing 37 trucks of gifts and 150 letters of comfort. On the morning of October 31st, the headquarters of the 5th Tank Regiment of the First Field Army of the People's Liberation Army held a grand rally to warmly welcome them. Attendees included the entire delegation, Bao Erhan, Chairman of the Xinjiang Provisional People's Government, Saifuddin and Alimjiang, Xinjiang representatives who had just returned from Beijing after attending the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Deng Liqun, representative of the Chinese Communist Party stationed in Yining, and over 500 officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army. At the meeting, Regiment Commander Hu Jian, on behalf of the People's Liberation Army, accepted the comfort and warm greetings of the people of the three districts and the National Army, and expressed gratitude and respect to the people of the three districts of Ita and A who had bravely struggled. He said: In 1942, the bandit Sheng Shicai colluded with American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in an attempt to turn Xinjiang into a base for anti-Soviet and anti-communist activities. The people of the three districts, for national liberation, for justice and freedom, began an armed struggle against Sheng Shicai and the Kuomintang reactionaries. The Kuomintang's countless frantic attacks on the people of the three districts were all disastrously defeated, and the National Army grew stronger from the bloody struggle. Today, the National Army and the People's Liberation Army have met, which is of great historical and political significance. The peaceful liberation of Xinjiang this time and the peaceful entry of the People's Liberation Army into Xinjiang are inseparable from the heroic battles of the people of the three districts of Ita and A and the National Army. After Regiment Commander Hu Jian's speech, the People's Liberation Army presented the National Army with one American-made submachine gun, one Canadian light machine gun, one Canadian hand-held machine gun, and one carbine, as well as 2,200 rounds of light machine gun bullets, all seized from the Kuomintang reactionaries, as a souvenir of the meeting between the brotherly forces. Saifuddin then took the floor and said: The victorious entry of the People's Liberation Army into Xinjiang, and the meeting with representatives of the brotherly forces of the National Army in the three districts of Ita and A, guarantee the eternal peace, democracy and unity of Xinjiang. Aisihaiti, head of the delegation of the people of the three districts of Ita and A, extended greetings to the officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army on behalf of the people of the three districts. He said excitedly: The people of the three districts of Ita and A are infinitely excited about the arrival of the People's Liberation Army in Xinjiang. Countless parades and mass rallies have been held in the three districts to express warm congratulations. In order to show that they will work together with the People's Liberation Army in the future to build a new Xinjiang, the people of the three districts have specially sent a delegation to pay tribute and express their condolences to the officers and soldiers of the Liberation Army. After extending greetings to the brotherly troops of the People's Liberation Army on behalf of the National Army, Resulov, Deputy Commander of the National Army, said: The National Army resolutely guarantees to continue working together with the People's Liberation Army to completely smash the remaining forces of the Kuomintang reactionaries and the new war conspiracies of imperialism. Now, on behalf of the National Army, I would like to comfort our long-struggling elder brothers with the wheat and flour produced by our own labor, and happily accept the American weapons you seized and gave us. Finally, Bao Erhan, Chairman of the Xinjiang Provisional People's Government, spoke, saying: For five years, the People's Liberation Army and the National Army have echoed each other from afar. This meeting is due to the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. Now Xinjiang is liberated, and the people of Xinjiang have seen the light. The meeting then adjourned amid shouts of "Long live the great Liberation Army that strives for the liberation of the Chinese people!" "Long live the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao!" "Long live Commander-in-Chief Zhu of the Chinese People's Liberation Army!"
