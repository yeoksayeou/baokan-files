Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 23rd: Panchen Erdeni cabled General Peng Dehuai, Deputy Chairman of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission and Commander of the First Field Army of the People's Liberation Army, from Qinghai last month, stating:

    Respected General Peng, Deputy Commander-in-Chief in Lanzhou:

    Panchen has been deeply favored and honored by the nation for generations. For over twenty years, I have been appealing and striving for the complete integrity of Tibet's territory and sovereignty, without the slightest懈怠 laxity. However, I have felt guilty for not achieving results. I am currently staying in Qinghai, awaiting orders to return to Tibet. Fortunately, under your leadership, the Northwest has been liberated, and the border people are rejoicing. In the future, the people's well-being is assured, and the nation's rejuvenation is within reach. The long-neglected Tibetan people are also eagerly anticipating and joyfully awaiting liberation. I implore you to lead the righteous army to liberate Tibet, eliminate the traitorous elements, and rescue the Tibetan people. Panchen respectfully extends his highest regards to you on behalf of all Tibetan compatriots, and pledges his sincere support and affection.

    Panchen Erdeni, October 1st

General Peng Dehuai replied to Panchen on this day:

    To Mr. Panchen Erdeni:

    Your cable has been received with respect. Tibet is Chinese territory, but under the traitorous policies of the Kuomintang, it has suffered the trampling of imperialism, causing the Tibetan people to fall into dire straits. Now, our People's Liberation Army, under the leadership of Chairman Mao of the Central People's Government, is about to liberate the entire country, destroy the remnants of the Kuomintang, and expel all aggressive forces of British and American imperialists, seeking the complete independence and liberation of Chinese territory, and placing all the people in a state of comfort. The liberation of Tibet is foreseeable. I hope that you will call upon the Tibetan people to intensify preparations and fight for their own liberation.

                                                                            Peng Dehuai, November 23rd

    【新华社兰州二十三日电】班禅额尔德尼上月自青海致电人民革命军事委员会副主席兼人民解放军第一野战军司令员彭德怀将军电称：兰州彭副总司令钧鉴：
    班禅世受国恩，备荷优崇。二十余年来，为了西藏领土主权之完整，呼吁奔走，未尝稍懈。第以未获结果，良用疚心。刻下羁留青海，待命返藏。兹幸在钧座领导之下，西北已获解放，边民同声欢忭。今后人民之康乐有期，国家之复兴可待。即久被忽视之西藏人民，亦莫不引领而望，卜庆来苏。仍垦领导义师，解放西藏，肃清叛国分子，拯救西藏人民。班禅谨代表全藏同胞，向钧座致崇高之敬意，并矢诚拥护爱戴之忱。

    彭德怀将军本日电复班禅称：班禅额尔德尼先生：
    来电敬悉。查西藏乃中国之领土，在国民党卖国政策下，遭受帝国主义之蹂躏，致全藏人民陷于水深火热。今我人民解放军在中央人民政府毛主席领导下，即将解放全国，摧毁国民党残余，驱逐英美帝国主义者一切侵略势力，求中国领土之全部独立与解放，登全民于衽席，西藏解放，已可预期。尚望先生号召藏族人民，加紧准备，为解放自己而奋斗。
