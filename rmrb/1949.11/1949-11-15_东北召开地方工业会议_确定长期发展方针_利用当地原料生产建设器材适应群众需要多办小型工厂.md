Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 14th - The Northeast People's Government's Industry Department recently convened a local industry conference, primarily to address the direction, tasks, and production management issues of local state-owned industries in various regions. More than 30 people attended the meeting, including directors and relevant cadres from industrial departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities. The meeting first pointed out that the local industries in Northeast China, which possess over 30,000 workers and more than 200 factories and mines of various sizes, have played a significant role in supporting the Liberation War, cooperating with the construction of state-owned industries, and supplying the needs of the people. The products of these industries have reached over 170 varieties (including over 70 varieties of civilian goods and over 100 varieties of industrial goods). From January to August of this year, the regions produced 200,000 bolts of cloth, 700,000 tons of coal, over 800 boxes of matches, and 1,200 units of large and small machines and industrial equipment. However, with the large-scale development and construction now underway throughout Northeast China, local industries must further play a greater role. The conference determined the future direction and tasks of local industries in Northeast China. The meeting pointed out that local industry should utilize local raw materials to produce construction materials and means of production for state-owned enterprises, and manufacture daily necessities needed by the market, especially daily necessities for farmers. It must, according to locally available conditions, establish many small factories to meet the needs of the masses. Local industry is part of the state-owned economy and an assistant to state-owned enterprises. Based on the above guidelines and in accordance with current needs, the conference pointed out that the tasks of the various provincial and municipal industries in the future are: First, to systematically develop industries that are already in production but are still insufficient, such as asbestos, soda ash, antimony, sugar, and caustic soda. Second, to establish production undertakings for pyrite, chromium, zinc, manganese, tungsten, saltpeter, rosin, brine, alum, etc., which have not been established in the past. Third, to continue to maintain the production of coal, bowls, socks, towels, soap, etc. Fourth, to improve the quality of transformer oil, needles (especially industrial needles), matches, rice straw paper, etc., and to continue to develop them.

    Regarding the issues of funds, raw materials, and product sales, the meeting believed that the issues of funds and raw materials should be approached from the principle of prioritizing the state and then the local areas. Production funds should currently be resolved by the regions themselves, and the state generally will not invest. The state-owned enterprises' needs can help local industries through ordering. The issue of raw materials should also be resolved by trying to find solutions independently as much as possible. If the problem cannot be resolved independently, and the Ministry of Industry is able to help, it should provide as much help as possible; however, regions are required to submit plans in advance. The issue of product sales cannot be completely resolved by the state's unified sales at present. The solution is, in addition to signing contracts with the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Commerce, the regions must also sign contracts with local cooperatives and directly sell to the market.

    东北召开地方工业会议
    确定长期发展方针
    利用当地原料生产建设器材适应群众需要多办小型工厂
    【新华社沈阳十四日电】东北人民政府工业部已于最近召开地方工业会议，主要地是解决了各地公营工业的方针任务及生产管理等问题。出席会议的有各省、市工业厅、局长及有关干部三十余人。会议首先指出：拥有三万余工人、二百余大小厂矿的东北地方工业，在过去支援解放战争、配合国营工业建设、供给人民需求等方面，都起到了很大作用。这些工业的产品已达到一百七十余种（其中民需品七十余种、工业用品百余种）。自今年一月至八月止，各地生产的布即有二十万匹，煤七十万吨，火柴八百余箱，大小机器及工业用具一千二百余台。但在今天东北全境已大规模开展生产建设的情况下，地方工业还须要进一步发挥更大的作用。会议确定了东北地方工业今后的方针和任务。会议指出，地方工业是利用当地的原料，为国营企业生产建设器材和生产资料；制造市场上需要的日用品，特别是农民日用品。它必须根据当地可能的条件，开办许多小型工厂，适应群众的需要。地方工业是国营经济的一部分，是国营企业的助手。从上述方针出发，根据目前需要，会议指出今后各省市工业的任务是：第一、有计划地发展现在已生产而又不够用的石棉、曹达灰、锑、糖、火碱等工业。第二、开办过去还没有开办的硫化铁、铬、锌、锰、钨、火硝、松香、卤水、白矾等的生产事业。第三、继续维持煤、碗、袜子、手巾、肥皂等项生产。第四、提高变压器油、针（特别工业用针）、火柴、稻草纸……等的质量并使之继续发展。
    关于资金、原料和成品推销问题，会议认为：资金原料问题，应从先国家、从地方的原则出发。生产资金目前由各地自己解决，国家一般不投资。国营企业所需要的东西，可通过订货方式帮助地方工业。原料问题，也应该尽量自己设法解决，如果自己解决不了，而工业部又能够帮助解决的，应尽量帮助；但要求各地预先提出计划。产品推销问题，现在完全由国家统一推销还办不到，其解决办法，除与工业部、商业部订合同外，各地还必须同本地合作社订合同，和直接向市场推销。
