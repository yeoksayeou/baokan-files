Novels About the Chinese Countryside
by Sivetlov Ukulenjev, translated by Jin Ling

    "Changes in Li Family Village" is a recently published book in democratic China. This novel was written by the young author Zhao Shuli. He published his first work "Xiao Erhei's Marriage" in 1943. This story and his second work "Li Youcai's Ballad" both focus on land reform, the democratic construction of the countryside, and the struggle between peasants and landlords.

    Zhao Shuli's novel touches on many issues, showing us a true picture of China's political, economic, and cultural development over the past fifteen years. Its significance lies not only in exposing the essence of the Kuomintang's reactionary rule and the Chinese Communist Party's remarkable construction power, but also in faithfully depicting the awakening of the Chinese people and the growth of their political power. Reading this book, you can get a complete concept of the spiritual temperament of the people of democratic China.

    Every reader can see and feel the real situation of today's China from the author's book. The author has succeeded in this goal. His novel helps readers (referring to Soviet readers - translator's note) understand the struggles of the Chinese people of the same era. Zhao Shuli shattered the fabrications of pseudo-science, such as the reactionary Western European "China experts" who said that the Chinese people have a "mysterious character," that "the Chinese people have always been conservative," and that they have "an instinctive aversion to anything new," and exaggerated China's inertia.

    In the literary circles of democratic China, Zhao Shuli's novels are highly praised. For example, the critic Zhou Yang said:

    "This is a major success in the literature and art of the liberated areas of China," "reflecting modern China like a mirror."

    The novel begins by depicting the customs and life of Li Family Village in Shanxi, a typical village among the thousands of villages in China. The story begins three years before the Japanese invasion.

    In some episodes, the author shows us the oppression of the powerless peasant masses by the despotic and lawless landlords, rich peasants, and Kuomintang bureaucrats.

    In this village, a trial is underway. Landlord Li Ruzhen, his followers, and a group of rich peasants and usurers are sitting in the judge's seat, judging the defendant, peasant Zhang Tiesuo, because his wife cut down a tree that was said to belong to Li Chunxi, a good friend of the landlord. In fact, there is no doubt that everyone knows that the tree belongs to Tiesuo. The landlord sentenced Tiesuo to pay a large fine. Tiesuo sold the only piece of land left to him by his father, and Li Chunxi took possession of his dilapidated cottage, thus beginning the wandering life of this bankrupt peasant.

    Tiesuo is the protagonist of this novel. The author emphasizes that he has seen "thousands upon thousands of Tiesuos" in China. Tiesuo is a representative figure, and his life is typical of the ordinary Chinese people.

    After being forced to leave the village, Tiesuo suffered countless hardships. Wherever he went, it was hardship and poverty. He began to think about the truth of things, and he longed for a better life, but he didn't know how to get it. Pursuit, torture, hunger... Just as Tiesuo was about to conclude that this was his fate, he met Xiao Chang, a young Communist Party member, in Taiyuan, the capital of Shanxi Province. So Tiesuo ran to ask him:

    "I don't understand so many things. How can Li Ruzhen never fall? Why can Third Master do whatever he wants and not be punished, and still be an official? How can Xiaoxi and Chunxi always have it so good?... Don't the people above reason with us?"

    "Right, right, right! If the people above weren't backing them, how would they dare be so unreasonable?" Xiao Chang said, "We have to overthrow all these guys who rely on power and are unreasonable, and let our upright ordinary people be in charge, and then there will be justice in the world."

    "Who can overthrow them?" Tiesuo asked.

    "Ourselves. As long as we are united, they are just a small number of people," Xiao Chang replied.

    The meeting with Xiao Chang left an indelible impression on Tiesuo. He learned that the Kuomintang persecuted the Communist Party because the Communist Party told the people the truth and pointed the way to freedom from poverty and oppression. After returning to his hometown, he told the peasants about his conversation with Xiao Chang. That was the most reactionary time of the Kuomintang.

    "An official document came down from above, calling on all localities to strengthen their anti-communism efforts. Rather kill a thousand innocent people than let one Communist go. The county magistrate, like a madman, sent out the anti-communist defense corps and the police to arrest people everywhere—anyone with one or two copper coins, a thread, a small mirror, or other uncommon objects on them was said to be a Communist code. Who knows how many people were arrested like this every day."

    The peasants of Li Family Village refused to join the "Anti-Communist Defense Corps," and Tiesuo and many others were arrested and imprisoned for sympathizing with the Communist Party.

    A year passed. The War of Resistance Against Japan broke out. The Communist Party called for the organization of a united front against Japan. The rising political power of the people forced the Kuomintang to agree to cooperate with the Communist Party.

    The Communist Party member Xiao Chang, like Tiesuo, had been in prison for a year, and now he came to Li Family Village. He, Tiesuo, Leng Yuan, and Bai Gou organized a movement to support the front lines. This movement was entirely for the benefit of the Chinese people against Japanese aggression, and it was also a large political school instilling new progressive ideas into the masses. As Zhao Shuli wrote:

    "The cloth covering the eyes of the people was taken off, and they saw what they had never seen before. They saw things beyond their own poor thatched huts."

    When the remnants of the feudal system still existed in the countryside, the war against Japanese aggression could not but be combined with the struggle against feudalism. Feudal forces had hindered the development of this country for centuries. The Communist Party implemented rent and interest reduction work, which improved the lives of the peasants. This novel particularly reflects the great work done by the Chinese Communist Party in the War of Resistance Against Japan and the democratic reforms in the countryside, while at the same time exposing the rumors about the Chinese Communist Party spread by reactionary foreign newspapers over the years. The author's depiction of the life of the peasants in Li Family Village is a good example, telling us how the correct policies of the Chinese Communist Party attract thousands upon thousands of supporters like a magnet.

    Landlords, rich peasants, and Kuomintang officials attempted to delay semi-feudal agricultural relations. They not only opposed democratic reforms, but also opposed any measures to reduce the burden on peasants. A district chief in the book replied to a landlord who was worried about the Kuomintang's past promises of rent and interest reduction decrees:

    "The decrees on rent and interest reduction have been set, but they are just empty words. It all depends on how you do it! The power is in our hands. We can waive a portion of the rent and interest that are already uncollectible, issue a list to announce it, and we have the name, but we don't actually suffer any losses."

    During the Anti-Japanese War from 1937 to 1945, the Kuomintang never stopped attacking the Communist Party. While the Communist Party put all its efforts into organizing the people to resist the enemy, the Kuomintang did not actively engage in the war against Japan, but often opened fire on the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army, who were actively participating in the war against Japan. This novel vividly depicts these facts.

    Landlords and rich peasants openly waited for the Japanese to invade. As soon as the Japanese occupied the village, Li Ruzhen and his followers immediately inflicted bloody revenge on the peasants. They abolished the minor concessions they had been forced to make at the beginning of the war. Xiao Chang and the most active people in the village went to a mountain to form a guerrilla team.

    The days when the Japanese and landlords flaunted their power in Li Family Village did not last long. When the Eighth Route Army liberated the village, they found that only half of the residents were still alive. Landlord Li Ruzhen and his accomplices could not escape punishment. The villagers gave them the punishment they deserved. Now the power is in the hands of the people. Everyone elected Tiesuo and Bai Gou as district chief and village chief.

    In the novel, the author tells us that these trampled and ignorant peasants have finally become people with keen minds, and they have confidence in their own strength. The interests of the country and the interests of all the people have begun to make them feel that they are of paramount importance. These new characteristics of Chinese peasants were gradually formed in the arduous struggle against Japan and the Kuomintang reactionaries. Zhao Shuli's novel refutes the rumors circulating abroad by reactionaries, who say that establishing a people's democracy in China is a fantasy. On the contrary, democracy has already been established in China and has been wholeheartedly supported by the people.

    There is no doubt that the most successful chapters of the book are those that describe the scenes of various changes taking place in this village. Zhao Shuli proved with rich and authentic materials that such amazing results were produced because the peasants unanimously supported the measures of the democratic government in the areas controlled by the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army, and the people actively supported the People's Liberation Army.

    He pointed out the remarkable changes that have taken place in Li Family Village since the establishment of the people's power:

    "Life in the village has changed in a new way. The Poor Peasants Committee led the organization of the Peasants Association. The committee distributed the land of landlords and rich peasants to poor peasants and long-term workers. The enthusiasm of the poor peasants who received the land was greatly increased. They now have food to eat and clothes to wear. In the first autumn, their harvest had already enabled them to establish a new life. They organized cooperatives, and after lengthy discussions, they organized five mutual aid teams. In the second autumn, they harvested more crops than that year."

    Let's continue!

    "It's not just the people of Li Family Village who are proud of their success. News came from neighboring villages that they also achieved victory."

    The villagers opened a school for children and also a night school for adults, and also established a village corps. In the new society, "the creativity of the people is endless." Men and women who never dared to dream of studying before now spend the long winter evenings in the village club, studying as hard as the children do during the day.

    The enemy is hidden, but their poisonous flames are often revealed. In a dialogue between an unexposed traitor and Tiesuo, it is implied that every change is only "temporary." Tiesuo sharply replied:

    "Can a mother bear to see her child being violently trampled? For the survival of her child, she can die, but that child will live on."

    The author tells us that the struggle for people's democracy in China is the direction of history. It is a struggle that has developed from China's past political, economic, and social relations, and this people's democratic movement is forever moving forward.

    "Fire can't burn it, water can't drown it, and no force can stop it," Tiesuo said.

    The protagonist of the novel knows that the people are willing to dedicate their lives to protect their fruits. The development of events confirms his words. News reached the village that the Kuomintang "ordered all Japanese troops not to surrender to the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army, and not to hand over their weapons to them." Moreover, the Kuomintang army had been ordered to "cross the Yellow River and attack the liberated areas." In this situation, we see:

    "When the news that the Kuomintang army was attacking the liberated areas reached Li Family Village, the peasants gathered together to discuss it. They only had one question: how to support the People's Liberation Army... In the evening, everyone knew what they should do. The young people prepared to leave their hometowns to join the army. Every peasant family moved all their belongings to the temple, rice, corn, beans, and some even brought their clothes. The self-defense team practiced in front of the temple... The village was lively from day to night, and every villager knew the danger that was about to come."

    The story of Li Family Village shows the inseparable relationship between the people and the People's Liberation Army. In the past, the Chinese people had hostility towards the army. They had a saying: "Good iron is not used to make nails, and good men do not become soldiers." In the eyes of the people, the army was the embodiment of violence, plunder, and lawlessness. The People's Liberation Army changed this relationship with the people. The people gave the People's Liberation Army their full support, not only because they repelled the Japanese invasion, but mainly because they are "the invincible symbol of the people's democratic forces."

    The Kuomintang reactionary army, although they were equipped with American weapons and trained by American officers, could not withstand the People's Liberation Army, just as they could not stop the vigorous development of the democratic movement.

    "All the loyal people of China stand behind the People's Liberation Army. This army, supported by the people of the whole country and closely united by the military and civilians, is a huge force. The Kuomintang reactionary army is just a dwarf."

    Zhao Shuli's novel also faithfully tells the recent past and present situation of China. It reflects the great changes in China over the past fifteen years. It is a story of the people, a story showing the daily struggles of the Chinese people themselves. The power of this book and its significance are enormous.

    关于中国农村的小说
    西维特洛夫  乌克伦节夫作  金陵译
    “李家庄的变迁”是最近民主中国出版的一本书。这本小说是青年作家赵树理所写的。他在一九四三年发表了他的第一篇作品“小二黑结婚”。这个故事和他第二篇作品“李有才板话”都是以土地改革，农村的民主建设，农民与地主作斗争为主题的。
    赵树理的这部小说接触到许多问题，他让我们看到了最近十五年来中国在政治上、经济上、文化上发展的一幅真实的图画。他的意义不仅是在暴露了国民党反动统治的本质和中国共产党惊人的建设力量，而且在这里面忠实地描写出中国人民的觉醒与政治力量的成长。读了这本书，你可以获得民主中国人民的精神气质的一个完整的概念。
    每一个读者能够从作者这本书中看到和感觉到今日中国的真实情形。在这个目标上，作者得到了成功。他这本小说使读者（指苏联读者——译注）明白了同时代的中国人民的斗争。赵树理粉碎了假科学的捏造，如反动的西欧的“中国专家们”所说的，中国人民具有“谜一般的性格”，“中国人民自古以来就是保守的”，“对任何一件新事物有着本能的反感”，以及夸张着中国的惰性。
    在民主中国的文学界内，赵树理的小说是被高度地评价着的，例如批评家周扬说：
    “这是在中国解放区文学艺术上一个主要的成功”，“象一面镜子似的反映了现代中国”。
    小说的开始是描写一个山西乡村李家庄的风俗与生活，李家庄是中国所有几千个乡村的一个典型。故事开始在日本进攻之前三年。
    在一些插话之中，作者显示给我们那些专横的，无法无天的地主、富农和国民党的官僚们对剥夺了任何权力的农民大众的压迫。
    在这个村庄里，正在进行着审判，地主李如珍，他的食客和一群富农和高利贷者都坐在法官的位子上审判着被告农民张铁锁，因为他的妻子把被指为属于地主的好朋友李春喜的树砍了。事实上，毫无疑问，谁都知道这树是属于铁锁的。地主判决铁锁付一大笔罚金。铁锁卖了他父亲遣留给他的仅有的一快地，李春喜占有了他的破茅屋，从此便开始了这个破产的农民的流浪生活。
    铁锁是这小说的主人公，作者着重的说，在中国他曾看见过“千千万万的铁锁”，铁锁是一个代表人物，他的生活是中国普通人民的典型。
    铁锁被迫离开村庄之后，受到无数的痛苦，无论他走到那里都是艰苦与贫穷。他开始去思索事物的道理，他想望着好一点的生活，但是他不知道怎么去获得它。追逐、拷问、饥饿……当铁锁正要断定这些就是他的命运的时候，他在山西省省会太原碰到了一个年轻的共产党员小常，于是铁锁跑去问他：
    “我有这么些事不明白，李如珍怎么能永远不倒？三爷那样胡行怎么除不办罪还能做官？小喜和春喜那些人怎么永远吃得开？……难道上边人也不说理吗？”
    “对对对！要没有上边人给他们作主，他们怎么敢那样不说理？”小常道：“总得把这伙仗势力不说理的家伙们一齐打倒，由我们正正派派的老百姓出来当家，世界才有真理。”
    “谁能打倒人家？铁锁问道。
    “我们自己，只要大家齐心，他们不过只是很少的人。”小常这样的回答道。
    和小常的会面使铁锁获得了一个不可磨灭的印象，他知道了，国民党迫害共产党是因为共产党告诉人民真理，而且指引了从贫穷与压迫中解放出来，到达自由的道路。他回到家乡之后，把他和小常的谈话告诉了农民们。那时正是国民党最反动的时候。
    “上面公事下来了，叫各地加紧防共，宁错杀一千个老百姓，也不叫放走一个共产党。县长接住这公事，跟疯了一样，撒出防共保卫团和警察到处捉人——凡是身上有一两个铜元，一两条线、小镜子或其他不常见的物件，都说成共产党的暗号，这样的人一天说不定要捉多少。”
    李家庄的农民都拒绝参加“防共保卫团”，铁锁和很多人因为对共产党同情都被捕入狱了。
    一年过去了。抗日战争爆发了。共产党号召组织抗日统一战线。人民的高涨的政治力量逼使国民党不得不同意和共产党合作。
    共产党员小常也和铁锁一样在监狱里住了一年，现在到了李家庄。他和铁锁、冷元、白狗一起组织了支援前线的运动。这个运动完全为了中国人民的利益去反对日本的侵略，同时也是一个大的政治学校灌输群众以新的进步的思想。正如赵树理所写的：
    “在人民眼睛上蒙着的布幕取下来了，他们看见了以前所没有看见的。他们看到了在自己的穷困的茅屋以外的东西。”
    在封建制度的残余还存在乡村里的时候，反对日本侵略的战争是不能不与反封建的斗争结合起来的。封建势力阻碍了这个国家的发展有几个世纪之久。共产党推行了减租减息的工作，使农民的生活得到改善。这部小说特别反映了中国共产党在抗日战争和农村的民主改革中所做的伟大工作，同时揭穿了反动的外国报纸历年来所散布的关于中国共产党的谣言。作者所描写的李家庄的农民的生活是一个很好的例子，它告诉了我们，中国共产党的正确的政策怎么象一快磁石似的吸引着千千万万的拥护者。
    地主、富农和国民党的官吏们企图拖延半封建的农业关系。他们不仅仅反对民主改革，而且反对任何减轻农民负担的措施。书中的一个区长回答一个忧虑着国民党过去所承诺过的减租减息法令的地主说：
    “减租减息的法令是定了，不过这是句空话，全看怎样做啦！权在我们手里，我们检那些已经讨不起来的欠租欠利舍去一部分，开出一张单子来公布一下，名也有了，实际上也不受损失。”
    在一九三七—四五年抗日战争中，国民党从未停止对共产党的进攻。当共产党把全力放在组织人民抗敌的时候，国民党不积极从事对日作战，却时常对抗日战争的积极参加者八路军和新四军开火，这本小说活生生的描叙了这些事实。
    地主和富农公开地等待日本人打进来，日本人一占领这个村庄，李如珍和他的食客们马上对农民们施以血的报复，他们废止了战争开头时候被迫所作的微少让步。小常和村庄里最积极的人一起到一个山上成立了游击队。
    日本人和地主在李家庄耀武扬威的日子并不长。当八路军解放了这个农村以后，发现这村子里的居民只有一半还活着。地主李如珍和他的帮凶们逃不过罚惩。村民们给予了他们应得的惩罚。现在权力是在人民的手里了。大家选了铁锁和白狗做了区长和村长。
    作者在小说里告诉了我们，这些被蹂躏的无知识的农民终于变成了有敏锐头脑的人们，他们对自己的力量具备了信心。国家的利益，人民全体的利益，开始使他们感到是头等重要的。中国农民的这些新的性格是在坚苦的抗日和反对国民党反动派的斗争中逐渐形成的。赵树理的小说驳斥了流行在国外的反动派的谣言，他们说要在中国建立人民民主政治是一个空想。相反的，民主政治已经在中国建立了，并且受到了人民的全心全意的拥护。
    毫无疑问的，本书最成功的几章是描写这个村庄中发生种种变革的场景。赵树理用丰富的真实的材料证明了由于在八路军与新四军控制的地区里，农民一致拥护民主政府的措施，人民对解放军的积极支援，才产生了这样惊人的结果。
    他指出了在人民的政权建立以后李家庄所发生的显著的变化：
    “村子里的生活改了新样了，贫农委员会领导组织了农会，委员会把地主和富农的土地分给了贫农和长工，分到了土地的贫农的积极性提高了，他们现在有东西吃了，有衣服穿了，第一个秋天，他们的收成已使他们建立了新的生活。他们组织了合作社，在长久的讨论之后，组织了五个变工队，第二年秋天他们收的庄稼比那一年都要多。”
    接下去说吧！
    “这不单单是李家庄的人骄傲着他们的成功，邻村传来消息，他们那儿也获得了胜利。”
    村民们为小孩子开了一个学校，同时也为大人办了夜校，还成立了村划团。在新社会中“人民的创造力是无止境的。”男人女人们在从前做梦也不敢想到念书，现在他们把整个冬天的长晚化费在村俱乐部里，和孩子们在白天一样的努力学习着。
    敌人隐藏起来了，但是他们的毒焰常常吐露出来，在一个未暴露的叛徒与铁锁的对话中，暗示了每一个改变只不过是“暂时”的，铁锁尖锐地回答说：
    “一个妈妈会忍心看着她的孩子受到狂暴的蹂躏吗？为了孩子的生存，她可以死，但是那孩子是会活下去的。”
    作者告诉了我们在中国为人民民主的斗争是历史的方向。它是从中国过去政治、经济、社会关系发展出来的一个斗争，这个人民民主运动是永远前进的。
    “火烧不了，水淹不了，没有任何力量能够阻止。”铁锁这么说。
    小说的主人公知道人民愿意献出他们的生命去保护他们的果实。事件的发展证实了他的话。消息传到村中国民党“命令所有日本军队不准向八路军和新四军投降，不准把武器交给他们。”而且国民党的军队已得到命令要“渡过黄河，进攻解放区。”在这种情形之下我们看到：
    “当国民党军队进攻解放区的消息传到李家庄之后，农民们都聚在一起谈论着，他们只有一个问题，怎么样去支援解放军……晚上每一个人都知道自己应该做的事，年轻人准备离开乡下去参军。每一个农家都把自己所有的东西搬到庙里去，有米，棒子，豆，有的甚至把衣服也搬来了，自卫队在庙前操练起来了，……村子里从白天一直热闹到深夜，每一个村民都知道将要来到的危险。”
    李家庄的故事表现了人民与人民解放军不可分离的关系。以前中国人民的心里对军队是怀有敌意的，他们有一句格言：“好铁不打钉，好男不当兵。”在人民的眼里，军队是暴行、掠夺、无法无天的化身。人民解放军改变了这种与人民的关系。人民给予解放军全力的支援，不仅仅是因为他们打退了日本的侵略，最主要的是因为他们是“人民民主力量的不可征服的象征。”
    国民党反动派的军队，虽然他们是美式装备，受美国军官的训练，但是他们不能抵挡人民解放军，正如他们不能阻止蓬勃发展的民主运动一样。
    “所有中国的忠诚的人民都站在人民解放军的后面，这个全国人民所支持的，军民密切团结的军队是一个巨大的力量，国民党反动派的军队只是一个侏儒罢了。”
    赵树理的小说也同样忠实地说出了中国最近的过去和现在的情形。它反映了中国过去十五年来的巨大变化，这是一个人民的故事，是一个显示中国人民自己日复一日战斗的故事，这本书的力量和它所包含的意义是巨大的。
