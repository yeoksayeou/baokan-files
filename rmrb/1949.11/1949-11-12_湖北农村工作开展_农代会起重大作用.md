    Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, November 11th: Since early September, most areas of Hubei Province have been carrying out autumn grain requisition work through Farmers' Representative Conferences, achieving great success. The experience of autumn requisition in various regions proves that: wherever the Farmers' Representative Conference has been earnestly used for democratic discussion and a struggle against concealing land has been launched, the burden on farmers is not heavy, the enthusiasm for delivering grain is high, and it is easier to control the old Baojia chiefs. Conversely, if the policy of reasonable burden has not been well implemented through the Farmers' Representative Conference, the autumn requisition work is still controlled and manipulated by landlords and old Baojia personnel, the burden on farmers is heavy, and morale is low. According to investigations, in the former type of area, farmers generally bear only about 30 jin per mu of land, while in the latter, they bear as much as 110 to 200 jin per mu.

    The Farmers' Representative Conferences in various regions are mainly convened at the district or township level. The participants are representatives of farm laborers, poor peasants, middle peasants, and progressive poor intellectuals. The representative conference discusses the main tasks in rural areas at present, discusses how to implement the government's policies and decrees on autumn requisition, anti-local bullies, bandit suppression, etc., and at the same time conducts class education, learns work methods, and improves and trains farmer representatives to become active members of the mass movement. This can also solve the difficulty of having too few cadres in the newly liberated areas.

    湖北农村工作开展
    农代会起重大作用
    【新华社汉口十一日电】九月初旬以来，湖北省大部地区通过农民代表会进行秋季征粮工作，得到了很大的成绩。各地秋征的经验证明：凡认真利用农民代表会进行了民主讨论并开展了反瞒田斗争的地区，农民负担就不重，交粮情绪就高，对旧保甲长也易于控制。反之，如没有很好地通过农民代表会贯彻合理负担政策，则秋征工作仍为地主及旧保甲人员控制操纵，农民负担重，情绪也低。据调查前类地区农民每亩田一般只负担三十斤左右，后者则每亩负担达一百一十至二百斤之多。
    各地农民代表会，主要是以区或乡为单位召开的。参加会议的为雇农、贫农、中农和进步的贫苦知识分子代表。代表会讨论当前农村的主要工作，讨论如何贯澈政府关于秋征、反恶霸、剿匪等政策法令，同时进行阶级教育，学习工作办法，提高和培养农民代表成为群众运动的积极分子。这样也就可以解决了新解放区干部少的困难。
