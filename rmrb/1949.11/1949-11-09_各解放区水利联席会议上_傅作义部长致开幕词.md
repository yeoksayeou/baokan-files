　　At the Joint Conference on Water Conservancy in Various Liberated Areas
  　Minister Fu Zuoyi's Opening Address
    [Our Newspaper] At the opening ceremony of the Joint Conference on Water Conservancy in Various Liberated Areas, Minister of Water Conservancy Fu Zuoyi delivered an opening address. The full text is as follows:

  　(I)
    Respected leaders, honored guests, esteemed experts and professors, and comrades responsible for water conservancy work in various regions. Today, we gather here to convene the National Joint Conference on Water Conservancy in Various Liberated Areas, and I believe every comrade must feel exceptionally excited. Because only when the People's Liberation War achieves a basic victory on a national scale, do we have the possibility of convening a conference of this scale and nature. The basic victory of the People's Liberation War enables us to establish a unified people's own government on a national scale. The basic victory of the People's Liberation War provides a further guarantee for the construction of a people's democratic country; the basic victory of the People's Liberation War opens up infinitely bright and infinitely broad prospects for all kinds of construction undertakings in the country, including water conservancy construction. Because our resources are unlimited, our manpower is unlimited, but in the past they suffered destruction, oppression, and restraint. Now that we have broken through this oppression and restraint, and seeing our magnificent mountains and rivers, our vast land and manpower, we really cannot suppress our feelings of joy and encouragement. Therefore, before the meeting, we should first pay our sincerest respect to Chairman Mao, who led us to win victory, to Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and to all those who fought for the cause of liberation!

  　(II)
    Developing Agricultural and Industrial Production – Water Conservancy is a Central Link
    What new conditions has this revolutionary new situation created for us? From a general perspective, I think the most important thing is that the Chinese people have been liberated from imperialist aggression, from the exploitation of bureaucratic capital and feudal forces, from the warlord civil wars, the Japanese imperialist war of aggression, and the counter-revolutionary war launched by the Kuomintang reactionaries, and have won the opportunity for democratic, peaceful, unified, and productive construction. Therefore, Chairman Mao's speeches at various times, and the Common Program of the People's Political Consultative Conference, all stipulate that productive construction is the central task of the country in the future, and our water conservancy work is one of the central links in all productive construction. Therefore, Articles 34, 35, and 36 of the Common Program related to production all emphasize the importance of water conservancy, because as far as agriculture is concerned, flood and drought prevention, and water diversion for irrigation, are the main guarantees for agricultural development, and as far as industry and transportation are concerned, hydropower generation, dredging rivers and constructing harbors, provide them with power and transportation facilities. From this mutually coordinating relationship, it is not difficult for us to see the important position of water conservancy construction in all productive construction. In particular, Chairman Mao said that the basic form of the Chinese revolutionary struggle is armed struggle, and the nature of this armed struggle is mainly peasant war, so in the past Chinese revolution, the Chinese peasants really contributed an immeasurable force. What are the demands of the peasants? Mainly the development of agricultural production, and the main key to ensuring agricultural production is to prevent water disasters and develop water conservancy. Historically, Yu the Great's water control has been praised by people for thousands of years. Mr. Li Bing, who completed the Dujiangyan irrigation project, his name and glorious deeds are recorded in history. Mr. Wang Tongchun, who came from a peasant background, opened some canals in Suixi, and the local people enshrined him together with the Dragon King. Mr. Li Yizhi, who devoted himself to water conservancy with scientific and technological means in modern China, is also loved by thousands of people. They all did the best things for the people in water conservancy, and thus received the support from the depths of the people's hearts. Comrades who have been engaged in revolutionary work for many years, of course, understand best the Chinese peasants' ardent demand for water conservancy. Therefore, whether from the economic task of developing production, or from the political task of consolidating the worker-peasant alliance, developing water conservancy is one of the central links.

    Combined with People's Needs, Water Conservancy Can Truly Develop
    As for the new revolutionary situation, what new conditions does it provide for our water conservancy cause itself, and what new requirements does it put forward for our guiding ideology or working methods? I believe that the new situation also puts forward some new characteristics for our work, and puts forward some new requirements, which require each of our comrades to have a clear understanding in their minds. The first characteristic is that the victory of the revolution, the combination of construction undertakings and the needs of the people, makes the real development of water conservancy undertakings possible. Under the reactionary regime in the past, the development of water conservancy undertakings was impossible. Therefore, the Chinese people have always lived a hard life alternating between drought and flood. On the one hand, because the government in the past was not a government that served the people, but only served to consolidate its reactionary regime, so it did not have the courage or enthusiasm to engage in large-scale water conservancy construction, at best it could only be a fame-seeking and passive prevention of water disasters, and did not have the courage to face the future and make long-term plans. Even if there were plans, they would often be ruined by the corruption of the administrative organs. Secondly, the more important obstacle to the development of water conservancy lies in the feudal land system. Land is owned by a few people, and landless peasants have no power or interest in improving water conservancy. As landlords of the feudal exploiting class, as long as they can maintain their feudal exploitation, they are unwilling to invest in the construction of water conservancy to improve production. Today's government is a people's own government led by the proletariat and based on the worker-peasant alliance. After the implementation of rent reduction and interest reduction and land reform, the producing peasants have acquired land for the first time. The unprecedented high enthusiasm of the four hundred million peasants for production provides an infinitely broad foundation for the development of water conservancy. In the old liberated areas, such as North China, East China, Northeast China, and Northwest China, water conservancy work mobilizes hundreds of thousands of people to participate in flood prevention and water conservancy projects. Countless examples can be cited. As far as flood prevention is concerned, due to the particularly large rainfall this year and the particularly high water levels in various rivers, the flood prevention work is the most urgent, and the actions taken by the comrades and the masses in various places are also the most courageous. Party and government organs at all levels in various places have made their best efforts to fight against floods. In the rescue, many heroic models have emerged, with leaders taking responsibility and cadres taking the lead, creating many excellent examples. Although what I know is still very incomplete, as far as I know, the Guantai dangerous project of the Yellow River was continuously rescued for twenty-five days and nights, and finally turned the danger into safety. During the autumn flood season, the Yellow River water level in Shanzhou exceeded 10,000 cubic meters per second for 99 consecutive hours, and the flow rate above 5,000 cubic meters per second lasted for 299 hours, with a total flow of 8.9 billion cubic meters, more than twice the 2.7 billion cubic meters in 1933. Due to the long duration, the water level in the lower reaches of Shouzhang and Yuncheng exceeded the 1937 flood level by 1 meter to 1.5 meters, Luokou exceeded 0.21 meters, and 5,000 cadres and 150,000 migrant workers in Pingyuan Province were all involved in the battle, day and night, to prevent major risks. From my individual conversations in the past few days, I know that all liberated areas have equally magnificent deeds. It is roughly estimated that the liberated areas have already invested more than 650 million catties of food for water conservancy this year. Labor is not yet included. The cadres in northern Anhui even saved their clothing expenses and transferred them to water conservancy expenses. What do these facts illustrate? It shows that only the people's own government can truly serve the people, that only the cadres of the people's government can have such excellent qualities of self-sacrifice, and that only the people who have turned themselves over can use the conscious strength of the masses to fight against nature.

    The second new feature is that with the basic liberation of the country, we have the possibility of handling water conservancy issues in a comprehensive and unified manner. In the past, the reactionary regime had feudal separatist regional divisions, and often adopted the policy of "making a ditch at the expense of one's neighbor." Conflicts and contradictions were everywhere between provinces, between upstream and downstream, and between main streams and tributaries. The ruling class often disregarded the disasters in other regions for their own interests. It goes without saying that managing water in this way will never produce results. Even in the liberated areas, due to the war, limited by the scattered environment, although great efforts have been made and certain achievements have been shown, in fact, this work can only be done in a scattered and partial way. Today's environment is completely different. With the basic liberation of the country, we have the possibility of handling water conservancy issues in a comprehensive and unified manner. From the preparatory meeting, it can be seen that everyone is also automatically asking to consider these issues in a unified manner, because rivers that run through several provinces must be planned comprehensively in order to be completely resolved.

    With the basic liberation of the whole of China, it is now possible to make an overall plan
    The third new feature is that in the situation of the basic liberation of the whole country, we have the possibility of combining the work of treating the symptoms with the plan of treating the root causes. In the past, it was not that we didn't know that symptomatic engineering should be coordinated with the plan to cure the root causes; but either limited by the scattered and isolated environment, a region could not measure and study rivers that run through several regions to formulate a plan to cure the root causes. Or, for famous rivers, experts and scholars had different opinions on the plan to cure the root causes, but there was no opportunity to discuss them together, especially without the opportunity to discuss them together with local government organs and local water conservancy practitioners. Now that the whole country is basically liberated, we have won these conditions. The Central People's Government has established the national water conservancy authority based on the above situation, and we have convened this meeting based on the above requirements.

    Here I would like to add that the National Water Conservancy Conference is one of the various professional conferences planned and convened by the Central Financial and Economic Committee. When the Ministry of Water Conservancy had not yet been established, the former North China Water Conservancy Commission had already issued a notice to convene it and was actively engaged in preparation. The Ministry of Water Conservancy has been established for less than ten days, and the organization is not yet sound, and the materials are not sufficient. For such a meeting, the preparatory work is really too little. Therefore, today I would like to express my gratitude to Director Xing of the former North China Water Conservancy Commission and all the comrades, and express my apologies to all the comrades and gentlemen attending the meeting for the many inadequate arrangements for food, accommodation, and reception. At the same time, we decided in the preparatory meeting to name this meeting the Joint Conference on Water Conservancy in Various Liberated Areas, indicating that we mainly rely on the various liberated areas to provide information and raise issues, as a preparatory meeting for the National Water Conservancy Conference to be held next year.

  　(III)
    Synthesize the specific conditions in various places to formulate a water conservancy construction policy
    Based on the above explanation, we can naturally see that today's conference should include the following purposes or tasks: In terms of general tasks, through this conference, we should achieve the following goals: First, to specifically understand the water conservancy situation in various parts of the country. This is very important to the central government, because in order to make unified leadership of national water conservancy in the future, we must first collect information and understand the situation. This is also extremely important for comrades working in various regions, because the opportunity to exchange work experience and refer to the advantages of other regions makes it easier to improve their own work. Second, through this conference, we must create a great unity of water conservancy talents and water conservancy workers throughout the country. Chairman Mao has repeatedly emphasized in his speeches that the development of working cadres cannot keep up with the needs of the development of the situation, and repeatedly emphasized that scientific and technological workers are the treasure of the people's construction undertakings. This phenomenon is even more obvious in our water conservancy department. Our country's area is so vast, there are so many rivers and lakes that can be used, and water conservancy undertakings are universally developed. Everywhere we feel the lack of talents and the importance of the unity of water conservancy workers. In this unity work, we put forward the following requirements, which is to combine technology and administration, and to combine science and experience. Because water conservancy is a scientific work and also a mass work, technical personnel must learn from administrative personnel, administrative personnel must learn from technical personnel, those who understand science must respect practical experience, and those who have experience must respect scientific new knowledge. Finally, everyone must learn from the people, because only by meeting the needs of the people and organizing the power of the people can water conservancy have a future for development.

    As for specific tasks, through this meeting, we must obtain three specific results. The first is to synthesize the situation in various places. We must propose a policy and task for water conservancy construction in the near future. The second is to combine the needs of the people in various regions with the country's existing economic strength. We must formulate a work plan for the next year, that is, 1950. The third is to have a unified leadership in national water conservancy according to work needs, and there must be organic cooperation between each other. Therefore, we must reach a consensus on the establishment of the vertical and horizontal relationships of national water conservancy organizations. This is the specific task of this meeting.

    Zuoyi himself is originally a layman in water conservancy technology; today I am presiding over this meeting, just to learn from you, and serve you with all my energy, hoping that you will exert your conscious efforts and successfully complete the tasks assigned to us by the revolutionary situation.

　　各解放区水利联席会议上
  　傅作义部长致开幕词
    【本报讯】各解放区水利联席会议开幕典礼上，水利部傅作义部长致开幕词，全文如下：
  　（一）
    各位首长，各位来宾，各位专家教授，各地区水利工作负责的同志们。今天我们共聚一堂，开全国各解放区水利联席会议，我想每位同志一定都感觉异常兴奋的。因为只有在人民解放战争，在全国范围内取得基本胜利的时候，我们才有可能召集象这样规模这样性质的会议。人民解放战争的基本胜利，使我们在全国范围内建立起统一的人民自己的政权。人民解放战争的基本胜利，给人民民主国家的建设，提供更进一步的保证；人民解放战争的基本胜利，给全国各种建设事业，包括水利建设事业，开辟无限光明无限广大的远景。因为，我们的资源是无限的，我们的人力是无限的，过去只是遭受着破坏，压迫，束缚。现在一旦冲破了这种压迫束缚，看看我们有这样雄伟的山河，有这样广大的土地人力，我们实在抑制不住欢欣鼓舞的情绪。因此我们在开会之前，应该首先向领导我们赢得胜利的毛主席，向朱总司令和中国人民解放军，向一切为解放事业奋斗的人们，致最诚挚的敬意！
  　（二）
    发展农业和工业生产　水利是中心环节之一
    这个革命的新的形势，给我们创造了什么新的条件呢？从总的方面来说，我觉得最主要的，是使中国人民从帝国主义侵略之下，从官僚资本封建势力的剥夺之下，从军阀内战，日帝侵略战争，和国民党反动派所发动的反革命战争中解放出来，赢得了民主的，和平的，统一的，生产建设的机会。所以毛主席历次的讲话，和人民政协的共同纲领，都规定生产建设为全国今后的中心任务，而我们的水利工作正是全部生产建设的中心环节之一。所以共同纲领有关生产的第三十四条、三十五条、三十六条，都提出水利的重要，因为就对农业来说，防洪防旱，引水灌溉，正是农业发展的主要保证，就对工业与交通来说，水力发电，疏浚河道与修筑港湾，正是给予他们以动力和输力的便利，从这种互相配合的关系上，我们不难看出水利建设在全部生产建设中的重要地位。尤其是毛主席说过，中国革命斗争的基本形式是武装斗争，这个武装斗争的性质，主要是农民战争，所以在过去中国革命过程中，中国农民实在贡献了不可估计的力量。农民的要求是什么呢？主要是发展农业生产，而保障农业生产的主要关键则是防止水患与开发水利。从历史上看，大禹治水，几千年来一直受着人们的赞颂，完成都江堰的李冰先生，他的名字和光辉事迹，载在史册，农民出身的王同春先生，在绥西开了一些渠道，当地人民便把他同龙王一同供奉。中国近代以科学技术致力于水利事业的李仪祉先生，也受着万千人民的爱戴。他们都是在水利上为人民做了最好的事情，因而得到人民从心灵深处发出的拥护。多年从事革命工作的同志，当然最了解中国农民对水利事业这种热切的要求。所以无论是从发展生产的经济任务上，或者是巩固工农联盟的政治任务上看，发展水利都是中心环节之一。
    与人民需要相结合　水利才能真正发展
    至于新的革命形式，对我们水利事业本身，提供出了什么新的条件，对我们的领导思想或工作方式，提出些什么新的要求呢？我认为新的形势也给我们的工作提出一些新的特点，提出一些新要求，须要我们每位同志在思想上有明确的认识。第一个特点，革命取得胜利，建设事业与人民需要相结合，水利事业的真正发展，才具有可能的条件。在过去反动政权之下，水利事业的发展是不可能的。所以中国人民始终是在旱涝交替之中过着困苦的生活，这一方面因为过去的政府，不是为人民服务的政府，只是为巩固它的反动政权，因此它没有魄力，没有热情，从事大规模的水利建设，充其量只能是沽名钓誉式的消极的防备水患，没有勇气面对将来做长远的计划，纵有计划也往往败坏于行政机构的贪污腐化。其次，发展水利更重要的障碍，尤在于封建性的土地制度。土地为少数人所有，无地的农民对改良水利没有力量也没有兴趣，作为封建剥削阶级的地主，则只要能够维持他的封建剥削，不肯投资于兴修水利改良生产的事业。今天的政府是无产阶级领导以工农联盟为基础的人民自己的政府，实行减租减息与土地改革以后，生产的农民，初次取得了土地。四亿数千万农民生产情绪的空前高涨，给水利事业的发展，提供无限广阔的基础。老解放区如华北、华东、东北、西北的水利工作，动辄动员几十万人民，参加防水患兴水利的工程，可歌可泣的例证，不胜枚举。仅就防汛方面而言，由于今年雨量特别大，各河水位特别高，因而防汛工作最紧急，同志们和各地群众所表现的行动也最勇敢。各地各级党政机关，都曾付出最大的力量，来与洪水斗争。在抢险当中，出现了很多英雄模范，首长负责，干部带头，创造了许多优良的范例。虽然我所知道的还很不完全，但就我所知如黄河贯台险工，即连续抢护了二十五昼夜，最后是化险为夷，秋汛中，黄河水位在陕州一万以上流量就持续了九十九小时，五千以上流量持续二百九十九小时，总流量达八十九亿立方公尺，较一九三三年二十七亿立方公尺，超出二倍以上。由于持续时间长，水位到下游寿张、郓城两段，超过一九三七年洪水位一公尺到一公尺五寸，洛口超过二公寸一分，平原全省五千干部，十五万民工，都投入战斗，昼夜抢护，才没有发生大险。从这几天我的个别谈话中，我晓得各个解放区都有同样伟壮的事迹，粗略估计，今年各解放区在水利上已经投下六亿五千来万斤食粮的经费。劳力犹未计算在内。皖北的干部甚至节约自己的服装费也移作水利的经费。这些事实说明什么呢？说明只有人民自己的政府，才能真正为人民服务，说明只有人民政府的干部，才能具有这样自我牺牲的优良品质，也说明只有翻了身的人民，才能以有觉悟的群众力量，来与自然展开斗争。
    第二个新的特点，是全国基本解放，我们已经有可能通盘的统一的来处理水利问题。过去反动政权，存在着封建割据的地域区划，往往采取“以邻为壑”的政策，甲省与乙省之间，上游与下游之间，本流与支流之间，到处充满着冲突矛盾，统治阶级往往为了自己的利益，不顾另一地区的祸患。象这样治水，永远不会造出成绩是不用说了。即就各解放区而言，因为战争的原故，限于分散的环境，虽然尽过很大的努力，表现一定的成绩，但是事实上也只能分散的局部的来作这个工作，今天的环境却完全不同了，全国基本解放，我们已经有可能通盘的统一的来处理水利问题。从筹备会议中看出，大家也自动要求统一的考虑这些问题，因为通贯几省的河流，必须做通盘的筹划，才能得到彻底的解决。
    全中国已基本解放　已可作出全盘计划
    第三个新的特点，是在全国基本解放的形势下，我们已有可能把治标的工作与治本的计划相结合。过去不是不知道治标工程应该配合治本的计划；但是或者限于分散隔离的环境，一个地区，对于通贯几个地区的河流，不可能测量研究以制订治本的计划。或者是著名的河流，专家学者对治本计划有各意见，却没有共同商讨的机会，尤其是没有与各地政权机关，与各地水利实际工作者共同商讨的机会。现在全国基本解放，我们已经赢得这些条件了。中央人民政府正是根据上述的情况，成立了全国水利的主管机关，我们正是根据上述的要求，召集了现在这一个会议。
    在这里我附带说明，全国水利会议是中央财经委员会计划召集的各种专业会议之一，当水利部还没有成立的时候，前华北水利委员会已经发出通知。决定召开，并积极从事准备。水利部成立还不满十天，组织既未健全，资料亦不充分，对于这样一个会议，准备工作实在做得太少。所以今天我一方面要向前华北水利委员会邢主任及各位同志们表示感谢，另一方面对于与会的各位同志各位先生，饮食住宿，许多招待不周的地方，表示歉意。同时，我们在筹备会中决定把这个会议定名为各解放区水利联席会议，表明主要依靠各解放区供给情况，提出问题，作为明年召开全国水利会议的准备会议。
  　（三）
    综合各地具体情况　制订水利建设方针
    根据以上的说明，我们很自然的可以看出，今天的大会，应该包括下列的目的或任务：就一般的任务来说，通过这一次会议，我们应该达到下列的几个目的，第一是具体了解全国各地水利的情况。这对中央是非常重要的，因为将来要对全国水利作统一的领导，必须首先汇集资料，了解情况。这对各地区工作同志，也是异常重要的，因为有机会交换工作经验，参考其他地区的优点，更容易提高自己的工作。第二，是通过这个会议要造成全国水利人才与水利工作者的大团结，毛主席在历次谈话中再三强调，工作干部的发展赶不上形势发展的需要，再三强调科学技术工作者是人民建设事业的至宝，在我们的水利部门这现象表现得更为显明，我国的地区如此广大，可以利用的河流湖泊如此众多，水利事业普遍展开，处处要感到人才缺乏与水利工作者团结的重要。在这个团结工作上，我们提出下列的要求，便是技术与行政相结合，科学与经验相结合。因为水利事业是科学性的工作，也是群众性的工作，所以技术人员要向行政人员学习，行政人员要向技术人员学习，懂科学的要尊重实践的经验，有经验的要尊重科学的新知，最后大家要向人民学习，因为只有适合人民的需要，组织起人民的力量，水利才有发展的前途。
    至于就具体任务来说，我们通过这次会议，要获得三个具体结果，第一是综合各地情况，我们要提出一个最近期间水利建设的方针与任务。第二是结合各地区人民的需要与国家现有的经济力量，我们要制定明年度即一九五○年的工作计划。第三根据工作需要，全国水利必须有统一的领导，互相之间必须有有机的配合，因此我们对于全国水利机构纵的关系与横的关系的建立，要获得一个一致的意见。这便是这此会议的具体任务。
    作义个人对水利技术本来是外行的；今天主持这会议，只是向各位学习，以全部精力为诸位服务，希望诸位发挥自觉的努力，胜利完成革命形势所提给我们的任务。
