Shaanxi's Water Conservancy事业

By our correspondent in Xi'an, Ke Ren

The history of water conservancy in Shaanxi began in the Zhou dynasty. The introduction of the Jing River for irrigation started in the Qin dynasty, and it was once said that "irrigating 45,000 mu of farmland means Guanzhong will never suffer famine." During the Han dynasty, the Wei River was further opened for navigation. Xiao He diverted the Bao River to irrigate 100,000 mu of farmland, and renovations have been carried out in every dynasty since then. Modern water conservancy projects began in 1930, and by the time of liberation, Shaanxi had a total of twelve canals. In the Guanzhong area, these included the Jinghui, Weihui, Luhui, Laohui, Lihui, Gan Hui, Heihui, and Meihui canals. In the southern Shaanxi basin, there were the Hanhui, Baohui, Longhui, and Leng Hui canals. The canals were all distributed between the Wei, Luo, and Jing rivers, with a total length of 933 kilometers of main and branch canals, irrigating 22 counties. Among them, the Jinghui Canal was the largest modern water conservancy project in Shaanxi, divided into three main canals and nine branch canals, stretching over 270 kilometers, sourcing from the Jing River, exiting from Zhangjiashan, and directly irrigating the five counties of Liquan, Jingyang, Sanyuan, Gaoling, and Lintong. Construction on this canal began in October 1930, and the first phase of the project was completed in 1932, with the second phase completed by the end of 1934. In 1947, the canal irrigated 692,834 mu of land. In May of this year, the Tanshushan water diversion dam of the canal was raised by 1.5 meters, increasing the water diversion from 19 cubic meters per second to 23 cubic meters per second. The daily water diversion is 1,987,000 cubic meters, adding irrigation capacity for 150,000 mu of land. The entire canal waters every 17 days on average. During the flood season, the sediment content often increases to about 55%. To prevent siltation in the canal body, water is often stopped for more than 20 days during the flood period. The Gan Hui Canal is the smallest of the canals, starting construction in May 1943 and completed in February 1944. It diverts water from the Gan River at Yaojiagou to irrigate both banks of the river. The main and branch canals are 5 kilometers long and can irrigate 3,000 mu of land. According to statistics in 1948, it actually irrigated 2,263 mu. Currently, among the completed canals in Shaanxi, except for the Luhui Canal which will not release water until 1950, the remaining canals have begun irrigation. According to statistics from ten canals in 1948, 1,355,811 mu of land were actually irrigated, producing more than 2,530,000 shi of grain and more than 310,000 dan of cotton that year.

Although the construction of water conservancy in Shaanxi has a history of thousands of years, in the past it was nothing more than a profit-making place for landlords and gentry. Farmers were completely excluded from the management of all water conservancy projects. Even the appointment of a water administrator had to be a landlord or gentry with a certain amount of land. The "Tax Collection Committee" for collecting water fees has always been controlled by landlords. Poor farmers who benefited from irrigation had to pay water fees in advance, while landlords with large amounts of land could pay less or not at all. The land surveys conducted to collect water fees were limited to ordinary farmers, and the land registration of landlords was often less than half. In short, all water conservancy projects were manipulated and controlled by local bullies, and the peasants had to remain in angry silence.

Under the corrupt and incompetent reactionary government of the Kuomintang, the construction of water conservancy in Shaanxi not only failed to achieve the development it deserved but was also greatly hindered. The Xuhui Canal, which could have been completed in two years, was extended to eight years due to the constant delays in funding from the Kuomintang government. Due to the long-term lack of maintenance, the irrigated area of each canal did not increase year by year but decreased annually. When the Heihui Canal was completed in 1942, it could irrigate more than 129,000 mu of land, but by 1948 it only irrigated 50,000 mu. The Meihui Canal irrigated 110,000 mu in 1940, but only 62,000 mu in 1948. The water conservancy事業 of Shaanxi under the clutches of the Kuomintang was regressing in the same way as the Kuomintang was regressing.

Although the liberated water conservancy事業 of Shaanxi has not been around for long, people are full of confidence in the future expansion of water conservancy. The masses of the Jinghui Canal excitedly said: "The irrigation is good this year because of the strength of the People's Liberation Army." The masses downstream are now actively rushing to repair the channels that have been leveled due to years of not seeing water, and the main and branch canals have universally launched silt removal and renovation work. According to the standard of irrigating 1,355,500 mu of land by all canals in Shaanxi this year, it is estimated that the existing canals can expand the irrigated area by 250,000 to 350,000 mu next year. At the same time, the government plans to allocate 250,000 shi of wheat in special water conservancy funds to prepare for the renovation and construction of Luhui, Leng Hui, Dinghui, Suihui, Leilongwan, the Second Weihui Canal, and the Heihe Reservoir next year, for water power generation. Under the leadership of the People's Government and the efforts of the masses, the future water conservancy事業 will move forward in great strides.

　　陕西的水利事业
    本报驻西安记者  克仁
    陕西水利事业开创于周，引泾灌田始于秦，曾有“灌田四万五千亩，关中至此无凶年”之说。汉时续开渭河以通舟楫，萧何引褒水灌田十万亩，自此历代皆有修改。一九三○年始有近代水利工程的建设，至解放前陕西已成各渠共有十二条。关中区包括泾惠、渭惠、洛惠、涝惠、澧惠、泔惠、黑惠、梅惠八渠，陕南盆地有汉惠、褒惠、泷惠、冷惠四渠。各渠皆分布于渭、洛、泾等河之间，各干、支渠共长九百三十三公里，灌溉二十二县。其中以泾惠渠为陕境中最大之新式水利工程，共分三条干渠，九条支渠，长达二百七十余公里，以泾河为源，由张家山出口，直灌醴泉、泾阳、三原、高陵、临潼五县。该渠始工于一九三○年十月，迄一九三二年完成第一期工程，至一九三四年年终完成第二期工程。一九四七年该渠灌溉面积达六十九万二千八百三十四亩。今年五月，该渠檀香山引水大坝已加高一公尺半，引水量由以前每秒十九立方公尺，增至每秒二十三立方公尺，每昼夜的引水量为一百九十八万七千公方尺，增添了十五万亩土地的灌水量。全渠平均十七天浇水一次，每到汛期，因含沙量常增至百分之五十五左右，为防止渠身淤积，泛期中常停水达二十余日。各渠中以泔惠渠为最小，始工于一九四三年五月，至一九四四年二月完工，由姚家沟引泔河水灌溉沿河两岸。各干支渠长五公里，可灌田三千亩，据一九四八年统计实灌田二千二百六十三亩。目前陕西已成各渠中除洛惠渠须俟一九五零年始可放水外，其余各渠已开始灌溉。根据一九四八年十个渠的统计，实浇地一百三十五万五千八百十一亩，该年产粮二百五十三万余市石，棉花三十一万余市担。
    陕西水利事业的兴建虽有数千年历史，但过去都不过是地主豪绅的牟利场所。一切水利事业的管理，农民完全被推在门外，就连一个行水人员的任用，也必须是有一定田亩的地主豪绅来担任。征收水费的“稽征委员会”则向来为地主们所把持，从未受到灌溉利益的贫苦农民，水费总得提前照纳，拥有大量土地的地主却可不纳或少纳。为了征收水费而举行的清丈地亩，所清丈的也仅限于一般农民，地主们的土地注册常常不上半数。总之，一切水利事业全为土劣所操纵把持，农民只得保持着激愤的沉默。
    在国民党腐败无能的反动政府统治下，陕西水利事业的修建不仅没有得应有的发展，而且还受到了很大阻碍。本来两年可以修成的湑惠渠，因国民党政府对拨款的不断延迟，该渠延长了八年始告完成。由于长期缺乏修整工程，各渠灌溉亩数不是历年增加，而是年有减少。黑惠渠在一九四二年修成时可灌田十二万九千余亩，至一九四八年仅灌田五万亩。梅惠渠一九四○年灌田十一万亩，到一九四八年只浇地六万二千余亩。在国民党魔爪下的陕西水利事业是和国民党的倒退一样的在倒退着。
    解放了的陕西水利事业，虽然时间不长，人们对未来的水利事业的壮大，已经充满了信心。泾惠渠的群众兴奋的说：“今年浇的好，是解放军的力量”。现下游群众均正积极抢修因多年未见水而平毁了的渠道，各干、支渠普遍的掀起了掏淤与增修工作。根据全陕各渠今年浇地一百三十五万五千五百亩的标准，预计已成各渠在明年可扩充灌溉面积二十五万至三十五万亩，同时政府计划拨水利专款二十五万石小麦，准备来年整理与兴修洛惠、冷惠、定惠、绥惠、雷龙湾、第二渭惠渠及黑河水库，向水发电站之用。未来的水利事业在人民政府的领导和群众的努力下，它将大踏步的向前发展。
