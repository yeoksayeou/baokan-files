Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 15th: TASS Moscow dispatch: Soviet Academy of Sciences President Vavilov recently stated in an interview with TASS reporters: "In the Soviet era, the Soviet Academy of Sciences has become the largest joint organization of research institutes, experimental stations, and research stations in the world. Its personnel is now forty times that of the Russian Academy of Sciences.”

Vavilov said: The past year marked a turning point for Soviet science and socialist construction to be more closely integrated. The results of various studies by Soviet scientists have been boldly and resolutely applied to practice. The Soviet Academy of Sciences, together with scientists from Ukraine, Belarus, the Transcaucasus, the Baltic region, and Central Asia, jointly completed many extensive studies this year that are of great importance in industry and agriculture. This summer alone, 125 expeditions were organized. The research of archaeologists and ethnologists has also written a new page in the cultural history of all ethnic groups in the Soviet Union. Physicists and mathematicians have made many discoveries. Scientists have invented many valuable instruments and solved complex mathematical problems, thereby obtaining new methods for studying symptomatology and meteorology. Geological expedition teams to Siberia, Central Asia, the Caucasus, and other regions of the Soviet Union have discovered many new mineral deposits. Biologists are actively participating in the implementation of Stalin's plan to transform nature and the movement to strive for bumper harvests every year.

Vavilov pointed out that most of the Soviet scientists are from the working class and peasantry. All of their scientific activities are carried out under the guidance of the scientific leader Stalin (ten years ago, Stalin was elected Honorary President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences for his outstanding contributions to enhancing science and further developing Marxist-Leninist theory). Soviet scientists, inheriting the traditions of Russian scientists, have provided many important contributions and theoretical summaries to the treasury of knowledge. In the Soviet Union, science not only serves the interests of the people, but is also completely accessible to the people, so science has become a mass science. This is the characteristic of science in the Stalin era.

Vavilov further pointed out that Soviet science has consolidated its ties with progressive forces around the world. Soviet science is progressive science, and its reputation and influence have grown immeasurably. The Soviet Academy of Sciences introduces its experience to people's democratic countries in order to use scientific achievements to benefit the people and help socialist construction.

According to Topchiev, Secretary of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, the number of scientific workers in the first ten years of the Soviet Union's establishment increased ninefold compared with the pre-revolutionary period. Now, the Soviet Union has 100,000 scientists. There are more than 150 various research institutions under the jurisdiction of the Soviet Academy of Sciences alone. Ten union republics, including Ukraine, Belarus, Georgia, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Kazakhstan, Armenia, Moldova, and Uzbekistan, have already established their own academies of sciences. The Soviet Academy of Sciences has also established branches and sub-branches in many republics.

    苏科学院长瓦维洛夫谈苏联科学成就
    【新华社北京十五日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联科学院院长瓦维洛夫最近在对塔斯社记者的谈话中指出：“在苏维埃时代，苏联科学院已成为世界上最大的研究所、实验所与研究站的联合组织。现在它的人员已有俄罗斯科学院的四十倍。”
    瓦维洛夫说：过去这一年，是标志着苏联科学与社会主义生产建设更密切地结合的转折点。苏联科学家各种研究的结果，都已被大胆而坚决地应用于实际。苏联科学院与乌克兰、白俄罗斯、外高加索、波罗的海地区与中亚细亚的科学家们，今年共同完成了许多在工农业方面有巨大重要性的广泛的研究。仅仅在今年夏天，就组织了一百二十五个考察队。考古学家与人种学家的研究，也在苏联各族民人的文化史上写下了新的一页。物理学家与数学家有了许多发现。科学家发明了许多有价值的仪器，解决了复杂的数学问题，由此获得若干研究征候学与气象学的新方法。到西伯利亚、中亚细亚、高加索及苏联其他地区去的地质学家考察队，发现了许多新的矿藏。生物学家正在积极地参加实现斯大林改造自然的计划及争取年年丰收的运动。
    瓦维洛夫指出：苏联科学家大多数是工农阶级出身的。他们的各种科学活动，都是在科学领袖斯大林（十年以前，斯大林就因为在增进科学和进一步发展马列主义理论方面有卓越的贡献而当选为苏联科学院名誉主席）的方针指导下进行的。苏联科学家继承俄罗斯科学家的传统，对知识宝库提供了许多重要的贡献和理论上的总结。在苏联，科学不仅为人民的利益服务，而且是人民完全可以接近的，因此，科学已成为大众化的科学。这就是斯大林时代的科学的特点。
    瓦维洛夫又指出：苏联科学已巩固了和全世界进步力量的联系。苏联科学是进步的科学，其声誉与影响业已无可衡量地增长了。苏联科学院把它的经验介绍给人民民主国家，以便利用科学的成就为人民谋利益，并帮助社会主义的建设。
    据苏联科学院秘书托普契夫称：苏联在成立的头十年中，科学工作者的数目就比革命前增加了九倍。现在，苏联有十万科学家。仅在苏联科学院管辖下的各种研究机关，就有一百五十个以上。乌克兰、白俄罗斯、乔治亚、立陶宛、拉脱维亚、爱沙尼亚、哈萨克、亚美尼亚、摩尔达维亚和乌兹贝克等十个加盟共和国，都已经建立起他们自己的科学院。苏联科学院并在许多共和国设立了分院和支院。
