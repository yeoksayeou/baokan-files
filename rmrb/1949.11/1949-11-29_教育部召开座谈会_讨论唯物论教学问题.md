　　Ministry of Education Holds Symposium
  　Discussing Problems in the Teaching of Materialism
    [This Newspaper's Report] The Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government convened its fourth symposium on the teaching of dialectical materialism and historical materialism on the 27th. Over a hundred professors, lecturers, teaching assistants, and student representatives from universities in Beijing and Tianjin attended. Zhang Zonglin presided over the meeting. First, reports were given on the general teaching situation of the course in various schools. After some supplementation by teachers and student representatives from various schools, Ai Siqi made a concluding speech. He pointed out that the mood of teachers and students in teaching is developing upward; and a certain degree of enthusiasm and creativity has been brought into play, with considerable gains. Teachers in charge of teaching have also learned how to do organizational work and political work through this study movement. He hoped that ideological leadership would be further strengthened in the future. He then gave a detailed explanation of the issue of internationalism, which students have universally raised, and requested teachers of each school to first use systematic theoretical knowledge to clarify the essential differences between the two different national systems in the world (socialist and people's democratic countries and imperialist countries), and then specifically correct and improve students' understanding of the Soviet Union, so as to strengthen internationalist education and oppose bourgeois nationalism. Next, he elaborated on the issues of class struggle and the New Democracy regime, emphasizing that students' class viewpoint should be strengthened, and the erroneous understandings of "above class" and old democracy should be cleared up. The meeting adjourned at 1 p.m.
