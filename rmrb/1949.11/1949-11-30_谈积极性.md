Talking About Initiative
    Suo Yin, Secretary of the Communist Youth League Committee of the Karpobolit Factory
    Translated by Li Qiao

　　Our League committee was criticized at the election summary meeting because it rarely listened to the opinions of the Communist Youth League members, rendering many League members ineffective in organizational life. Who is often the chairman at League member meetings? Zhuerkov, the secretary of the League committee. Who often speaks at discussion sessions? Zhuerkov, Demitriade, Lojinberg. Who carries out almost all the tasks? Zhuerkov, Lojinberg, Demitriade. A small group of activists leads discussions, reads newspapers, publishes blackboard newspapers, and participates in long-distance travel. Only when meetings are to be held and League dues are to be collected do the people in the League committee think of other League members. Many good resolutions often become empty words, ending without accomplishment.
    Young female workers Mulasova and Yesina have been participating in the organization for more than a year. But they have never spoken at meetings. They have not carried out any tasks in the past, nor are they carrying out any now. It is wrong for the League committee members to try to use the lack of experience of new League members as an excuse to explain the lack of initiative of new League members. From the first day new League members join, they should cultivate and develop their consciousness as masters of their own organization, rather than waiting until they reach a certain age in the League. At the election summary meetings in factories and workshops, it was indeed shown that every League member has a strong will to create a career. We have a responsibility to support and develop this will by all means.
    Female Communist Youth League member Valentkina Kolenikova raised the issue of insufficient attendance in the political study groups at the meeting. This criticism shows her concern for her organization. At the same time, Valentkina also mentioned that she works the night shift and it is difficult to participate in studies that start at 5:30 in the evening.
    Kolenikova pointed out: "But there are many female Communist Youth League members who have more difficulties than I do!" She was thinking of those female workers who live on the right bank of the Toha River and have to take the train to the factory every day.
    No, this is not a personal complaint, but a sincere cry of a master inspired by the shortcomings in the work. Based on the proposal of Valentkina Kolenikova, we began to implement dividing the study group into two shifts. The number of attendees immediately increased, and the study began to be more lively, active, and interesting. There are countless similar examples, and these examples are enough to show that many Communist Youth League members actively participate in organizational life, and they adopt a master's attitude towards their cause.
    Female Communist Youth League member Kina Sviriteva suggested systematically reading newspapers aloud. After getting off work, she used meal times to gather young people, and she personally engaged in this work. Weiyatekina and Julavlieva came to help her. The committee was concerned about whether the female workers could get the newspapers in time, and instructed them on which materials they needed to read.
    Adjacent to the Karpobolit Factory is the chemical coking factory, which was awarded the Lenin Medal. Many of our comrades have only heard about the complex and interesting production process of coke ovens and this factory. Communist Youth League members suggested organizing a visit to the coke ovens. Our young athletes wanted to hold a twenty-mile ski relay race with students from military schools and have already started preparing.
    We believe that we must be bolder in trusting the Communist Youth League members and giving them important tasks. Some of the things that the secretary of the League committee has done and is still doing can be successfully completed by other comrades as well.
    Not long ago, the All-Soviet Lenin Communist Youth League Committee discussed the issue of the Communist Youth League members in the Third Workshop paying their League dues. Previously, these issues were handled by the secretary of the League committee, who forgot about other work when handling this issue. Now we have appointed Lukikova as a member of the workshop committee. She carefully analyzed the reasons for the non-payment of League dues and talked with those who violated League discipline. Then Lukikova made a proposal to the committee, which agreed with the proposal. This is how we helped the Communist Youth League members in the Third Workshop, and it is very important to let Communist Youth League member Lukikova participate in the activities.
    We should also admit that there are many League members who have not yet participated in active activities. To overcome the previous shortcomings, we will strive to make every League member feel that they are the true masters of the organization in future work. For example, I think all League members should be able to practice being chairmen at meetings. Of course, the chairman is elected at the meeting, but the presidium of the meeting should not always only propose these few activists to take on the role.
    We would like at least three or four of the people who make reports at each meeting to be people who are speaking on stage for the first time. We help them prepare the materials for their first speech, and pay attention to training them to be able to make reports regularly, not just members of the committee. The workshop's Communist Youth League organizing committee members should go to the meeting to make reports, and ordinary League members should also make reports.
    A major task cannot be completed by every League member. Start by letting Communist Youth League members first notify the young people in the neighboring workshop about the ski competition. Then make a phone call to the district committee to inquire about when to conduct the propaganda competition. It should be known that if a person can see a small part of their work in the public cause, then they will have a completely different mood, and they will treat the organization with the attitude of a master. On the eve of November 7th, the committee gave the female Communist Youth League members the task of making velvet flowers and arranging commemorative pillars. How enthusiastically they started this work!
    Of course, it is right to give fewer tasks, and it is necessary to be good at supervising the implementation, so that the Communist Youth League members feel that the League committee remembers them and remembers the tasks assigned to them. It is not just about supervision, but also about caring and helping them to complete the tasks. In any work, even a small job, it is necessary to give young League members advice. If a young person is asked to publish a blackboard newspaper, then they must be taught how to collect news and how to arrange it. Without such help, the task will become a formality and will not be of any benefit.
    Start cultivating the Communist Youth League members' consciousness as masters of their own organization from the group. In the group, it is easier to study individuals and easier to find out which things are suitable for someone to do. It is a pity that the League committee's leadership over the groups is not very good. It is often like coaxing children, not giving League members the opportunity to handle problems independently, and not allowing them to give full play to their initiative. In fact, our groups here often hold meetings under the proposals of the workshop's general branch and the League committee. The secretary of the workshop's general branch himself convenes the Communist Youth League members instead of the group leader, and he decides the agenda himself. He speaks alone, and the League members just listen. Leadership means inspiring the Communist Youth League members from many aspects and caring for and educating the group leaders. But in any case, one cannot convene group meetings instead of the group leader, or formulate the agenda for the group.
    With the active participation of Communist Youth League members and young workers, all the workers in our factory completed the annual plan ahead of schedule on November 7th. With the efforts of Communist Youth League members and young workers, raw materials worth 1,025,000 rubles were saved. Twenty-nine young workers completed five years of output. Communist Youth League members Koluginsky, Ochintsev, and Belomitreva have already completed six years of output. (Translated from the Communist Youth League Daily, March 1, 1949)

　　谈积极性
    卡尔波立特工厂团委书记  索因
    李樵  译
    我们的团委会在选举总结大会上受到了批评，因为它很少听取共青团员的意见，使得许多共青团员在组织生活中失去了作用。谁经常在团员大会上当主席呢？团委书记朱尔可夫。谁常常在讨论会上发言呢？朱尔可夫，德米特里阿得，洛金别尔格。是谁执行了几乎所有的任务呢？朱尔可夫，洛金别尔格，德米特里阿得。一个积极分子的小集团领导讨论，读报，出版黑板报和参加长途旅行。只有当要召开大会和征收团费的时候，团委会里的人们才想到其他的团员们。很多很好的决议经常变成了一纸空文。落得有始无终。
    青年女工穆拉索娃和耶西娜参加组织早已不止一年了。但是她们在会上从来没有发过言。她们过去没有执行过，现在也没有执行着任何任务，团委会里的人们企图借新团员缺乏经验为口实，来解释新团员的积极性不够，这是不对的。从新团员入团的第一天起，就应当培养和发展他们对自己组织的主人翁的自觉，而不是等待，直到他们混到一定的团龄的时候。在工厂和车间的选举总结大会上，确实表现出了每一个团员都有着强烈的创造事业的意志，我们有责任用尽各种方法来支持和发展这种意志。
    女共青团员瓦莲基娜·柯列妮可娃在大会上提出了关于政治学习小组的出席人数不够的问题。从这个批评中可以看出她对自己的组织是关心的。同时瓦莲基娜还谈到她是上夜班的，很难参加从晚上五点半才开始的学习。
    柯列妮可娃指出说：“可是有好多女共青团员她们比我的困难还多哩！”她想起住在托河右岸的那些女工们，她们要每天坐火车到工厂上班。
    不，这不是个人的叫苦，而是有感于工作中的缺点而发出的一种真诚的主人翁的呼声。根据瓦莲基娜·柯列妮可娃的提议，我们开始实行把学习小组分成两班。出席的人数马上增加了，学习开始进行得更生动活泼和更有趣了。类似这样的例子举不胜举，这些例子足以说明好多共青团团员是积极地参加组织生活的，他们对事业是采取主人翁的态度的。
    女共青团团员基娜·斯维丽特娃建议有步骤地进行朗读报纸。她在下班以后利用吃饭的时候召集青年们，她亲自动手来从事这个工作。魏雅特基娜和茹拉弗列娃来帮助她。委员会关切女工们能不能及时得到报纸，指示给她们那些材料需要她们读。
    与卡尔波立特工厂为邻的是荣膺列宁奖章的化学炼焦工厂。我们的许多同志只听说过关于炼焦炉和这个工厂的复杂有意思的生产过程。共青团团员建议组织参观炼焦炉一次。我们的青年运动家想和军事学校的学生们举行一次二十哩的滑雪接力比赛，并且已开始准备。
    我们认为必须更大胆地相信共青团团员，给她们些重要任务。团委书记一个人所做过的和现在还在做着的某些事，其他的一些同志也能很顺利地完成了。
    不久以前全苏列宁共青团团委会讨论了关于第三号车间共青团团员们缴纳团费的问题。以前这些问题是由团委书记来处理，当处理这个问题的时候便把别的工作都忘了。现在我们指定卢基柯娃做车间委员会的委员，她很细心地分析了不绵纳团费的原因，同违犯了团纪的人进行谈话。然后卢基柯娃向委员会提出建议，委员会同意了这个建议。我们就是这样帮助了第三号车间的共青团团员们，让共青团员卢基柯娃参加活动，这是很重要的。
    我们还应当承认，有许多团员现在还没有参加积极活动。克服以前的缺点，在以后的工作中竭力做到使每一个团员都感到自己是组织的真正主人。譬如：我认为应当让所有的团员都能在大会上练习做主席。当然，主席是在大会上选举出来的，但是不能让大会的主席团总是只提出这几个积极分子来担当。
    我们愿意在每次大会上做报告的人当中，至少能有三四个是首次登台讲话的人，我们帮助他们准备第一次的讲演材料，注意培养他们能经常做报告，不只是委员会的委员，车间底共青团的组织委员要去大会上做报告，就是普通的团员也应该做报告的。
    一个重大任务不是每个团员都能完成的。开始让共青团员先通知隔壁车间底青年们关于滑雪竞赛。再打一个电话给区委会，讯问一下什么时候进行宣传竞赛工作。要知道，如果一个人在公共的事业中能看到自己工作的一小部分，那么他将完全是另外一种心情，他将以主人翁的姿态去对待组织了。十一月七日的前夜，委员会给了女共青团员们做绒花和布置纪念柱的任务，他们是多么热情地着手于这件工作呵！
    当然了，少给任务是对的，应当善于监督执行，使得共青团员们感到团委会记得他们，还记得分配给他们的任务。不只是要监督，还要关心帮助他们来完成任务。在任何一件工作里，即使是很小的一件工作里也需要给年青的团员们提出意见。如果让一个小伙子去出黑板报，那么就必须教给他如何收集消息，如何编排。没有这样的帮助，任务就将流于形式，并且不会有什么益处的。
    从小组里开始培养共青团团员对自己组织的主人翁的自觉。在小组里容易研究个人也容易找出那一件事情适合于某人去做。令人遗憾的是团委会对小组的领导还不大好。还经常象哄小孩似的哄他们，不给团员们以单独处理问题的机会，没有让他们广泛地发挥他们的主动性。事实上我们这里的小组经常是在车间总支和团委会的提议之下召开会议的。车间总支书代替小组长自己召集共青团员，自己又决定议事日程。他一个人讲话，团员们只是听着。领导意思就是从多方面启发共青团团员，关切地教育培养小组长。但是在任何情况下也不能代替小组长召集小组会，替小组制订议事日程。
    在共青团团员和青年工人的积极参与之下，我们工厂的全体工人于十一月七日提前完成了一年的计划。在共青团团员和青年工人的努力之下，节约了价值一、○二五、○○○卢布的原料。二十九个青年工人完成了五年的出产量。青年团团员科卢金斯基，奥幸切夫，别洛靡特则娃已经完成了六年的出产量。（译自一九四九年三月一日共青报）
