Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 8th. The first powerful public security force of the Chinese people—the People's Public Security Forces Central Column—held a celebration of its establishment in Beijing at 2:00 PM today. Zhu De, Vice Chairman of the Central People's Government, and Luo Ruiqing, Minister of Public Security of the Central People's Government, and Vice Minister Yang Qiqing, personally attended the review and addressed all commanders and fighters. Before the start of the meeting, a military parade was held. The review car, led by Vice Chairman Zhu and Minister Luo Ruiqing, slowly circled the field to the sound of majestic military music. The well-equipped reviewed troops stretched for several miles. The reviewed public security forces were all wearing brand-new dark green uniforms, looking energetic and high-spirited. After the military parade, the celebration began. Zhou Yan, Chairman of the meeting and Political Commissar of the People's Public Security Central Column, called on all commanders and fighters in his opening remarks to be utterly devoted and actively strive to protect national construction, suppress reactionaries, protect the people's safety, and protect the glorious tasks of the Central People's Government. Vice Chairman Zhu De made important instructions on the tasks of the People's Public Security Forces in his speech. Vice Chairman Zhu pointed out: The People's Public Security Forces are troops that defend the interests of the people. Therefore, in their actions and words, they must set an example for the people everywhere. Especially in terms of unity between the army and the people and adherence to discipline, they should be extra strict, so that the People's Public Security Forces become a model of unity between the army and the people among the people's armed forces. Minister Luo Ruiqing pointed out in his speech that the People's Public Security Forces Central Column has two major tasks: one is to guard the people's capital, Beijing; and the other is to serve as a model for the national public security forces. He said that although the open enemies of the people across the country have been defeated by the People's Liberation Army, the remaining enemies are by no means willing to accept this. They are constantly attempting to restore their power and seize back the fruits of the people's victory. Therefore, if the country does not have a strong public security force to wipe out bandits and secret agents and suppress all sabotage and disturbances by enemies at home and abroad, the people's victory cannot be guaranteed, and the people's construction cause cannot even be discussed. Therefore, the task of the People's Liberation Army is glorious, and the task of the People's Public Security Forces is also glorious. Yang Qiqing, Deputy Minister of Public Security of the Central People's Government, and Wu Lie, Commander of the People's Public Security Central Column, also spoke at the meeting. Vice Minister Yang instructed all commanders and fighters of the People's Public Security Central Column to study hard and improve their cultural level, theoretical level, and public security skills. Commander Wu said that the People's Public Security Central Column will faithfully and conscientiously implement the call of Vice Chairman Zhu and the instructions given by Minister Luo and Vice Minister Yang. The meeting adjourned after shouting slogans. (Attached picture)

　　保卫人民利益，镇压反动分子！
  　人民公安中央纵队成立
    朱副主席罗部长亲临检阅号召努力做军民团结模范
    【新华社北京八日电】中国人民第一支强大的公安部队——人民公安部队中央纵队，于今日下午二时在北京举行庆祝成立大会。中央人民政府朱德副主席、中央人民政府公安部罗瑞卿部长、杨奇清副部长均亲临检阅和向全体指战员训话。大会开始前先进行阅兵。以朱副主席和罗瑞卿部长为首的阅兵车在雄壮的军乐声中徐徐绕场一周。装备精良的受检阅部队长达数里。受检阅的公安部队均着深绿争崭新军装，精神焕发，意志昂扬。阅兵典礼结束后，庆祝大会开始。大会主席、人民公安中央纵队政治委员周衍在开会词中号召全纵队的指战员忠心耿耿，为保卫国家建设，镇压反动分子，保卫人民安全，保卫中央人民政府的光荣任务而积极努力。朱德副主席在讲话中就人民公安部队的任务作了重要的指示。朱副主席指出：人民公安部队是保卫人民利益的部队，因此，在自己的行动上，言论上要处处做人民的表率，特别是在军民团结和遵守纪律方面，应格外要求严格，使人民公安部队成为人民武装中军民团结的模范。罗瑞卿部长讲话中扼要地指出人民公安部队中央纵队负有两个巨大的任务：一是警卫人民的首都北京；一是作为全国公安部队的模范。他说，全国人民公开的敌人虽然被人民解放军打倒了，但残余的敌人决不就此甘心，他们时时刻刻企图复辟，企图夺回人民的胜利果实，所以全国如果没有一支强大的公安部队，肃清土匪特务，镇压内外敌人的一切破坏和捣乱，人民的胜利是没有保障的，人民的建设事业更是谈不上的。因此人民解放军的任务是光荣的，人民公安部队的任务也是光荣的。会上讲话的尚有中央人民政府公安部副部长杨奇清和人民公安中央纵队司令员吴烈。杨副部长指示人民公安中央纵队的全体指战员要好好学习，提高文化水平、理论水平以及公安业务。吴司令员表示人民公安中央纵队一定忠诚地、兢兢业业地执行朱副主席的号召和罗部长、杨副部长给予的指示。大会在高呼口号后散会。（附图片 ）
