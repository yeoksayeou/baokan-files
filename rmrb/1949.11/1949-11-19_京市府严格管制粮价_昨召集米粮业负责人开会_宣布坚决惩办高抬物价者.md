　　The Beijing Municipal Government Strictly Controls Grain Prices
    Yesterday Convened Meeting of Rice and Grain Industry Leaders
  　Announces Resolute Punishment of Those Who Raise Prices
    [Beijing News] Yesterday afternoon (the 18th) at 1:00 PM, the Beijing Municipal People's Government convened a meeting of responsible persons from grain stores, rice and flour businesses, and mechanized flour mills at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, announcing that in order to stabilize the people's livelihood and safeguard the development of legitimate industry and commerce, the government has decided to strictly control grain prices, and those who raise grain prices will be severely punished without leniency. At the meeting, Deputy Mayor of the Municipal People's Government, Zhang Youyu, made the following explanation on the measures for strictly controlling grain prices: Price increases have various causes, but the hoarding and refusal to sell by unscrupulous merchants, and speculative price increases, are the direct factors that trigger soaring prices. This not only endangers the lives of two million citizens, but also affects social order, which the government cannot stand idly by. Therefore, sixteen unscrupulous merchants were arrested on the 13th. After that, grain prices tended to fall. However, since the 16th, unscrupulous merchants have begun to be active again, continuing to manipulate grain prices to rise again. Especially today, when northwest transportation has been unblocked and the source of grain has been opened, grain prices should no longer rise. The government guarantees the legitimate profits of merchants, but it will strictly ban illegal profiteering. In the future, the government will strengthen inspections and mobilize the masses to report unscrupulous merchants. Those who ignore the law, disregard the people's livelihood, and raise prices, whether wholesale or retail, will be severely punished.

　　京市府严格管制粮价
    昨召集米粮业负责人开会
  　宣布坚决惩办高抬物价者
    【北京讯】北京市人民政府昨（十八）日下午一时在市商会召集粮栈业、米面粮业、机制面粉业负责人开会，宣布政府为安定人民生活，维护正当工商业的发展，决严格管制粮价，如有高抬粮价者，严惩不贷。会上，市人民政府张友渔副市长对严格管制粮价的措施，作如下说明：物价上涨固有种种原因，而奸商囤积拒售、投机抬价，实为掀起物价暴涨的直接因素。这不仅危害二百万市民生活，且影响社会治安，政府实难坐视。故在十三日逮捕十六家奸商。其后，粮价已趋跌落。但自十六日起，奸商又开始活动，继续操纵粮价回升。特别在西北交通解禁，粮源已通的今天，粮价更不应再涨。政府是保证商人合法利润的，但对非法暴利，则严予取缔。今后，政府决加强检查，动员群众检举奸商。如有忽视法令，不顾人民生活，高抬物价者，不论批发零售，都决予严惩。
