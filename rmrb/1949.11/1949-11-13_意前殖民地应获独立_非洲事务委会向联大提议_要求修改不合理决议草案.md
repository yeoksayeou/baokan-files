Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 12th: According to a report from Telecommunications Agency, New York: The African Affairs Committee, led by the black singer Paul Robeson, sent a memorandum to UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie and every national UN delegation on the 10th, requesting five modifications to the draft resolution on former Italian colonies "for the sake of justice, peace and true freedom in Africa." This draft resolution was put forward in the United Nations General Assembly by delegations from Western imperialist countries.

The African Affairs Committee's amendments request: (1) Reject the original proposal for Italy to administer Somaliland, and support direct administration by the United Nations through the Trusteeship Council. (2) A definite guarantee of independence for Somaliland within five years should be given, instead of the "currently evasive" decision – that is, it can only gain independence after ten years unless the United Nations decides otherwise. (3) Grant Libya—a unified Libya—independence within a maximum period of one year, and withdraw all foreign troops and military bases from the area to ensure its true independence. (4) Decide the future of Eritrea now, instead of sending another investigating team to the area as proposed in the original draft resolution. The people of Eritrea should be allowed to freely decide their political future within a maximum period of three years. (5) In relation to the advisory committee for Libya, the Soviet Union should have the same opportunities as other major powers in the appointment procedures and regional trusteeship arrangements.

The African Affairs Committee declared: The decision on former Italian colonies should not depend on the interests of any European or other national government, but on "the needs and desires of the people of Libya, Eritrea and Somaliland, as well as the needs and desires of Abyssinia and the African people." The committee's memorandum declared that efforts to prevent the Soviet Union from participating equally in the administration of former Italian colonies "undermine the principle of great power unanimity, which is the foundation upon which the United Nations can successfully perform its functions and achieve its ultimate goals of lasting peace and human progress." The memorandum warned: "The African people, black people everywhere and the whole world will closely observe and judge the nature of this world organization by the United Nations' decision on former Italian colonies."

    意前殖民地应获独立
    非洲事务委会向联大提议
    要求修改不合理决议草案
    【新华社北京十二日电】据电通社纽约讯：由黑人歌王罗伯逊领导的非洲事务委员会，十日将一项备忘录致送联合国秘书长莱氏及每一国家的联合国代表团，要求“为了公道、和平及非洲真正的自由”，对前意大利殖民地的议案作五点修改，该议案系由西方帝国主义国家的代表团在联合国大会上提出的。
    非洲事务委员会的修正案要求：（一）否决原议案所提的由意大利管理索马利兰，赞成由联合国通过托管委员会直接管理。（二）应该给予索马利兰五年内独立的确切保证，以代替“目前规避性的”决定——即，除非联合国另有决定，则它在十年以后才能获得独立。（三）最多在一年的期间内予利比亚——统一的利比亚——以独立，并撤除外国在该地的一切军队及军事基地，以保证它的真正独立。（四）在目前决定厄立特里亚的前途，而不是如原议案所提的，再派遣一个调查团前赴该地。厄立特里亚人民使在最多三年期限以内，得以自由决定其政治前途。（五）在对利比亚顾问委员会的关系中，在对其他的任命程序及地区的托管安排中，苏联应与其他大国有同样的机会。
    非洲事务委员会宣称：对前意大利殖民地的决定，不应取决于任何欧洲或其他国家政府的利益，而应取决于“利比亚、厄立特里亚及索马利兰人民的需要和愿望，以及阿比西尼亚及非洲人民的需要和愿望”。委员会的备忘录宣称：阻止苏联同等地参加对前意属殖民地的管理机构的努力，“破坏大国一致的原则，这一原则是联合国之能以成功地发挥其职能，及达成其持久和平和人类进步的最终目标的基础”。备忘录警告称：“非洲人民、各地的黑种民族及全世界，将以联合国对前意大利殖民地的决定，而密切地注意并判断这个世界团体的特质。”
