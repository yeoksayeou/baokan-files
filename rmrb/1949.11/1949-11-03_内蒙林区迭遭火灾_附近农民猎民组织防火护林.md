[Reported by this newspaper] Since the beginning of autumn, fires have occurred repeatedly in certain areas of Inner Mongolia. Recently, over 30 mountain fires have occurred in the Yakeshi Forest Bureau and along the Yalin Line under the jurisdiction of the China Changchun Railway, burning over 60,000 poods of sheep grass, 26 "gu bang" (@ - likely a measurement of area or timber volume - unable to confirm unit), and injuring three horses. In addition, bridges, electrical poles, and other things were burned. In the Aohan Banner of Zhaomeng League, two field fires occurred on October 13th and 16th, burning more than 1,900 bundles of millet and other crops. A fire also occurred in Tuduhe Street in the Hulun Buir League on the 16th. Before this, five mountain fires had occurred successively in the Bailang, Choer, and other forest areas, with a burned area of several thousand square meters. Fortunately, all areas had fire prevention organizations and preparations in place, preventing major disasters. The reasons for the repeated fires are mainly the following: (1) Careless cooking or smoking causing fires; (2) Sparks ejected from locomotives easily causing this type of disaster near railways; (3) Children playing with fire causing disasters; (4) Saboteurs setting fire to fields. In light of the repeated mountain fires, the Inner Mongolia Forestry Bureau, in order to implement fire prevention and forest protection work, has specially formed temporary inspection teams to go to the Arxan, Zhalantun, and Yakeshi forest areas to inspect the fire prevention organizations and equipment on site. Various localities are also actively conducting in-depth investigations and understanding of the causes and circumstances of the fires, and will hand over the perpetrators to the government for punishment according to law. In order to strengthen the prevention of wildfires, farmers living near the forest areas and hunters living off the mountains have organized fire prevention and forest protection committees or established hunter brigades, formulated covenants, and launched a forest protection campaign.

　　内蒙林区迭遭火灾
  　附近农民猎民组织防火护林
    【本报讯】入秋以来，内蒙古某些地区屡次发生火灾。最近牙克石林局及中长铁路牙林线管内，发生山火已达三十多次，烧毁六万余普特羊草，二十六古磅＠子，并伤马三匹，此外烧毁的还有桥梁、电柱等。昭盟阿旗在十月十三日、十六日发生烧场事件两起，烧掉谷子等一千九百余捆；呼纳盟兔渡河街亦在十六日发生火灾。在此以前，白狼、绰尔等林区曾相继发生过五次山火，延烧面积达数千平方米。幸各地早有防火组织与准备，未致酿成巨灾。追究屡次发生火灾的原因，不外有以下几种：（一）做饭、抽烟不慎，引起火灾；（二）机车喷出的火星，在铁道附近容易酿成此种灾害；（三）小孩玩火引起灾害；（四）坏分子纵火烧场。内蒙林务局鉴于迭次发生山火，为贯彻防火护林工作，特编制临时检查小组分赴阿尔山、扎兰屯、牙克石各林区现场检查防火组织与防火设备。各地亦正积极深入调查与了解发生火灾原因及情况，并将肇事者，送交政府依法惩办。各林区附近农民与靠山生活的猎民，为了加强防止野火，已纷纷组织防火护林委员会或成立猎民大队，订出公约，展开保护森林运动。
