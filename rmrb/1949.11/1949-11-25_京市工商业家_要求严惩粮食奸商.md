　　Beijing Industrialists and Businessmen
  　Demand Severe Punishment for Grain Profiteers
    [Beijing News] Following the passage of the proposal for severe punishment of profiteers by the Second Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference, industrialists and businessmen in the city yesterday (24th) expressed their opinions on the already arrested profiteers Wang Zhenting, Tian Yuchuan, and others, unanimously demanding that the government severely punish them according to law. Pu Jiexiu said: "Wang Zhenting and others' speculative activities of hoarding and raising prices not only directly harm the common people, but also affect legitimate industries." Sun Fuling said: "The government originally guaranteed legitimate profits for businessmen, but they were undermined by these short-sighted profiteers. Therefore, the industrial and commercial sectors all advocate that the government should severely punish them according to law." Liu Yifeng said: "Grain tiger Wang Zhenting never lets go of any opportunity for speculation. We hope that the government can punish such merchants who seek exorbitant profits regardless of the life and death of the people according to law!"

　　京市工商业家
  　要求严惩粮食奸商
    【北京讯】北京市第二届各界人民代表会议通过严惩奸商提案后，市工商业家昨（二十四）日对已经逮捕之奸商王振廷、田雨川等纷纷发表意见，一致要求政府依法严惩。浦洁修说："王振廷等投机倒把、抬价拒售的行为，不但老百姓直接受害，连正当工业也受影响。"孙孚凌说："政府本来是保证商人合法利润的，但被他们这些不顾大体的奸商给破坏了，所以工商业界都主张政府应依法严惩他们。"刘一峰说："粮老虎王振廷，只要有投机机会，就一点也不放松，象这种图暴利而不顾人民死活的商人，我们希望政府能依法惩处！"
