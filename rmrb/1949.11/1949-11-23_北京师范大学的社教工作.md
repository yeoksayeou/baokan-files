　　The Community Education Work of Beijing Normal University
　　Since the liberation of Beijing, under the leadership of the People's Government, students of Beijing Normal University have been conducting half-day schools, night schools, and literacy classes for out-of-school children, women, and adults in the vicinity of the university. In the process of teaching, the following experiences have been gained.

　　Because the student body is complex, including adults and children, and their needs are different, the teaching materials must also be diverse to meet the requirements of various students. For children's classes, ordinary primary school textbooks can be used, while worker literacy textbooks and temporarily compiled materials are used for adult and women's classes. The content of such teaching materials must not be subjectively compiled by a few teachers; they should delve into the students' lives to understand their level and needs, and compile them with reference to their opinions. For example, in the compilation of textbooks for women's literacy classes, the teachers first formed research groups for each subject, and used individual interviews, group discussions, and tests to understand what the students needed; and referred to various textbooks, women's magazines, and other materials to formulate outlines for each subject, and compiled them in colloquial local language, and then discussed them in each group, and also asked the students for their opinions before putting them into trial use. In addition, during teaching, some materials must be added at any time to match current events, such as celebrating the founding of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, welcoming international friends, sports meets, plague epidemics... Because the mission of the school is not only limited to the transmission of written symbols, but also to help them transform their thinking and improve their political awareness and cultural level.

　　How to divide students into classes and groups is also an issue that should be paid attention to in teaching. Because the students here have very different cultural levels, some are illiterate, some have studied in private schools, and some have attended middle school or primary school... Therefore, a test should be conducted before class formation, and then classes should be formed according to the level of each student in each subject. For example, a student's Chinese level may be in the advanced class, but his arithmetic level is only suitable for the elementary class, and his political common sense may be in the intermediate class; in this way, not only is teaching convenient, but the learners also feel that it is suitable for them.

　　In addition to lectures in the classroom, home visits and individual talks are also good means of community education work. On the one hand, this can help to understand the students' thoughts, family situations, etc., which can help teaching and life guidance; on the other hand, it can more closely connect the students with their families, so that community education work can not only extend to the students themselves, but also be more widely promoted to the society.

　　Recreational activities are also indispensable in community education work. The Hufangqiao Adult Night School has teachers leading dancing and singing every Saturday night, and the students are in high spirits, which also helps to improve their learning mood. Many collective activities of Beijing Normal University, such as parties, movies, and student union re-elections, are also visited by them, which is of great help to them. Once they watched "Turning Scrap Iron into Steel," one student exclaimed: "People are not born bad, the environment has too much influence. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, bad people can also become good people." This corrected their mistaken notion that everything is destined, and recognized the Communist Party's love and correct leadership for the people. At the Beijing Normal University Student Union election evening, they were given an understanding of democratic elections, as well as the role and responsibility of the student union. The recent establishment of student unions in both the children's and adult schools is also a practical political lesson!

　　北京师范大学的社教工作
　　师大通讯组
    北京解放以后，师大同学在人民政府领导下，以学校周围的失学儿童、妇女、成人为对象，分别举办了半日学校、夜校和识字班。在教学的过程中，得到了如下的经验。
    由于学生对象复杂，有成人、有儿童，而其要求也不同。象成人们都要求学了就能用。因此，教材也必须多样性，以符合各种学生的要求，儿童班的教材可用普通小学的教本，成人班和妇女班则用工人识字课本和临时编的教材。这种教材的内容切不可凭几个担任教学的人主观地编写一套，应深入到学生中去，了解他们的程度和要求，参照他们的意见编写。比如妇女识字班课本的编写，最初由担任教学者组成各科教材研究小组，用个别谈话、共同讨论、测验等方式来了解学生所需要的是什么；并参照各种教本，妇女杂志等资料，拟出各科大纲，用通俗的本地话编写出来，再经过各小组的讨论，同时也请学生们提意见，这样才拿出来试用。此外，在教学时，还得随时配合时事添补一些材料，如庆祝中华人民共和国中央人民政府的成立，欢迎国际友人，体育大会，鼠疫流行……。因为学校所负的使命，并不仅限于文字符号的传授，而是同时帮助他们改造思想，提高政治觉悟与文化水平。
    学生如何分班分组，也是教学上一个应该注意的问题。因为这里学生的文化程度，彼此相差很大，有一字不识的，有念过私塾的，也有入过中学或小学的……，所以在编班之前应先作一个测验，再根据各个学生各科程度分科编班，比如某学生国文程度可以在高级班，但算术程度只适合于低级班，政治常识又可以在中级班；这样，不仅教学方便，学习者也感到对自己适合。
    除了在课堂上的讲授外，家庭访问和个别谈话也是社教工作很好的手段。这一方面能多了解学生的思想、家庭情况……，可以有助于教学和生活指导；另一方面更能紧密的联系学生与他的家庭，使社教工作不仅及于入学的学生本身，更广泛的能推展到社会中去。
    文娱活动在社教工作中也是不可少的，虎坊桥成人夜校每星期六晚上有先生领导舞蹈、唱歌，学生们情绪都很高，对学习情绪的提高也有帮助。还有师大的许多集体活动，象晚会、电影、学生会改选等，他们也来参观，对他们帮助也很大。有一次他们看过“废铁炼成钢”后，就有学生发出了这样的感慨：“人并不是生出来就是坏的，环境影响太大了，在共产党的领导下，坏人也能变成好人。”这纠正了他们一切命运注定的错误观念，并认识到了共产党对人民的爱护和正确的领导。在师大学生会竞选晚会上，给予了他们对民主选举的认识，还有学生会的作用与责任，最近儿童成人两校先后成立了学生会。这也是一个实际的政治课！
