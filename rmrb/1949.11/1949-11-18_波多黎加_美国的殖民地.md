Puerto Rico, in its original meaning, means "Rich Port." This is the name given by the Spanish to this island nation located at the mouth of the Caribbean Sea, in the eastern part of the Greater Antilles. The Antilles start from Cuba, winding east and then south around the Caribbean Sea in an arc, all the way to Trinidad off the coast of Venezuela. Apart from the three republics of Cuba, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic, these islands are colonies of the United States, Britain, France, and the Netherlands.

Puerto Rico is the largest U.S. territory in this region. It was discovered by Columbus during his second voyage to the "New World" in 1493. At that time, the island's indigenous inhabitants called it "Borikén." Spanish colonization began in the early 16th century, eliminating the natives. In a very short period, nearly all of the 60,000 Indians were exterminated. By 1797, only less than three thousand remained. The Spanish, with their African slaves, settled on the island.

The despotic rule of the Spanish military governors lasted until the early 19th century when the Puerto Ricans achieved their initial victory in their struggle for liberation. At that time, the island had extensive trade with many European and South American countries, selling them coffee, fruits, sugar, tobacco, and spices, and buying back their products.

In February 1898, under the pressure of mass movements, Puerto Rico was allowed to establish an autonomous government. Eight months later, American imperialism invaded the island, "liberating" it from Spanish rule. Thus, the shackles of American trusts replaced the shackles of Spain. This invasion was accompanied by crude and deceptively propagandistic efforts to obscure imperialist aims and reduce popular resistance. Major General Miles, commander of the American occupation forces, declared that the invaders came "bearing the banner of freedom" and that their sole desire was to "bestow" upon the people of Puerto Rico the "benefits of the free institutions" of the American government. How this promise was fulfilled can be seen from the fifty-year record of American monopolistic capitalists ruling Puerto Rico.

Puerto Rico is a small country, with an area of 8,897 square kilometers and a population of 2,113,000. There are also the small islands of Vieques and Culebra attached to it, which have been seized by the United States as naval and air force bases. Among the white population, which accounts for 76 percent of the total population, the descendants of Spanish immigrants are the vast majority. Blacks and people of mixed race account for 20 percent.

The island's resources include gold, tin, silver, platinum, aluminum, @, copper, mercury, excellent marble, and other useful minerals, but the United States deliberately hinders industrial development, striving to maintain it as a colony for obtaining cheap raw materials.

American sugar trusts have made the island's entire economy deformed. When the Americans invaded, Puerto Rico's main product was coffee, but it also produced staple foods to meet local needs. Sugarcane plantations occupied no more than 15 percent of the arable land. In pursuit of profits, American monopolistic capitalists have turned Puerto Rico into a large plantation for obtaining cheap sugarcane. They have done everything in their power to make the Puerto Rican people their perpetual tribute payers, making them merely producers of raw materials and consumers of American industrial and agricultural commodities.

The American Sugar Company drove more than 50,000 farmers off the land, seizing the best land in the fertile plains for themselves. When land shortages are universally felt, more than 100,000 acres of land are held by landlords who have never been to Puerto Rico, or only come occasionally to inspect the industry that brings them such huge profits.

According to the 1940 census, there were 55,200 farms in the country, but 42 percent of the cultivated land belonged to large landowners associated with four American sugar trusts and several banks. In fact, with the help of dozens of wealthy Puerto Rican landlords, the sugar companies under the Morgan Group controlled the entire cultivated land, enslaving farmers and workers. The vast number of farmers deprived of their land constituted a reserve of cheap labor, cruelly exploited in sugarcane fields and several factories. John Hoss wrote in America’s "Reader’s Observer":

"In a truly imperialistic manner, we have undermined the Puerto Rican economy, which is based on export trade... We occupied a country that was beginning to develop an economy based on exporting various goods to many different countries... In order to increase sugar production, we systematically destroyed its productivity, turning it into a one-crop economy."

American monopolistic capitalists even hinder the development of the sugar refining industry on the island. Last year, due to the vigorous advocacy of the sugar trust, the United States passed a law stipulating that Puerto Rican sugar could export 910,000 tons to the United States, but with a special provision that only 126,000 tons of refined sugar were allowed to be imported, and the rest had to be exported as semi-finished products to be refined in the United States. This measure alone is estimated to cost Puerto Rico between 20 and 30 million U.S. dollars in national income annually, and more than 4,000 Puerto Rican people will lose their jobs as a result.

California and Florida fruit tycoons, in order to avoid competition, induced the U.S. Congress to pass laws declaring Puerto Rico’s excellent oranges, grapes, and lemons "unsuitable" for import into the United States. Puerto Rican coffee was squeezed out of the American market by American importers of Brazilian and Guatemalan coffee, who jealously guarded their monopoly.

The fate of the people on the island is only unemployment and hunger. A Puerto Rican celebrity, Ramillo, once said:

"The North American government is using the same method it used to exterminate the Indians on the American continent to deal with Puerto Rico. It defeated their resistance by force and deprived them of their means of survival... Obviously, stubborn people are falling ill and dying under the rule of the North American empire, under the shadow of its flag."

　　　×　　　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　　×

"Beautiful climate," "blue sky," "three hundred kilometers of bright beaches," "traveler's paradise"—that is how Puerto Rico is depicted in colorful advertisements to attract the attention of wealthy tourists.

Those tourists take beautiful ships to the capital of the island nation—San Juan. The Condado Hotel, built by New York coal and railroad tycoons as a winter resort for wealthy Americans, and the beautiful tropical scenery give the impression that the island nation is prosperous. The hotel is located outside the city, far from the miserable huts made of broken wooden boxes and tin sheets. Tourists appreciate Eskambron. On both sides of it can be found other modern hotels, cockfight bars, casinos, clubs for local celebrities, entertainment venues, and beaches with modern swimming facilities. From his car window, he can glimpse the crowded, narrow streets, where most of San Juan residents live in extremely unsanitary conditions; and he walks to Barasekuron to visit the Columbus Monument. Afterwards, he goes to the chapel to visit Ponce de Leon's tomb. From the heights of San Juan, he can see the magnificent villas of American millionaires (bankers, sugar factory owners, textile and beverage magnates), some in New England colonial style, others favoring Kansas revival architecture. Finally, after visiting the Governor's Mansion (called La Fortaleza) and Old Moro Palace or Fort San Cristobal, where the American guard is stationed, the tourist returns to New York, Chicago, Detroit, or Kansas City with satisfaction.

The real life of Puerto Rico is very different from the dazzling advertisements made by travel agencies for the rich. United Press's Liga Sasserley warned: If you go to Puerto Rico, "don't stray too far from the beach, some Puerto Ricans may collapse in front of you; if someone falls on the ground, the reason is simply hunger. Puerto Rico has a population of more than two million, and most of them are starving to death."

The lives of the residents are impoverished. Puerto Rican workers earn an average of 108 U.S. dollars per year. Seasonal workers working in sugarcane fields (usually only four months of work per year) earn five dollars a week; while bread, rice, and other grains and consumer goods are even more expensive than in the United States.

Massive unemployment is long-term. Although the official figures sent by the American representative to the United Nations say that approximately Puerto Rico "only" has 6,500 unemployed, in reality, about 200,000 to 300,000 workers and seasonal workers seek work.

Unemployment, poverty, hunger, disease—these are what American imperialism has brought to the people of Puerto Rico. It is worth noting that in the report submitted by the United States to the United Nations last year, although it gave a favorable account of the status of its colonies and dependencies, it had to admit that the people of Puerto Rico suffered from "chronic malnutrition." The report stated: "A considerable number of people suffer from malnutrition and go to drug stores."

We can add one sentence: Necessary medical care is not implemented. Because, in the same report, it is also acknowledged:

"The island lacks doctors, nurses, and hospital beds. Suffering from pollution, lack of drinking water, and prevalent dysentery, enteritis, pneumonia, malaria, and venereal diseases."

The figures published in the newspaper reveal that the percentage of lung disease in Puerto Rico is ten times higher than in North Carolina, the child mortality rate is forty times higher than in the United States, and the infant mortality rate is even higher.

In order to find a way out, tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans migrate to the United States every year. Many run to the miserable slums of New York, but life is still not easy there. Anyone who goes to see the terrible living conditions of 40 million such immigrants in the Black District—the lower part of the East Bronx and nearby areas—will know. In dilapidated houses, three or four families squeeze into a dirty room. Racial discrimination has followed them since their first day in the United States. After years of searching for work, the best outcome is to get the most strenuous and lowest-paid jobs. Tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans are constantly crowding into New York's ever-increasing unemployment ranks.

American journalist William Bleth, in his recent book "Southward Journey—From the Great River to Patagonia," recorded some impressions of Puerto Rico. After Bleth studied the economic status of this American colony and discovered its terrible situation, he concluded that even large-scale immigration could not save the residents from hunger. Finally, he discussed in detail the desperate future of the people enslaved by the dollar kingdom and sarcastically suggested that the only solution was to force a reduction in the birth rate to reduce the population. Bleth pointed out that old Dachdi implemented infanticide to avoid poverty, and he said kindly:

"Maybe this plan is wrong... but this fact is unavoidable, that birth control is the main and final solution."

For American businessmen, they don't even bother to think about such a huge plan. They are used to treating Puerto Rico as a place for profitable investment. A large amount of labor, low wages, and a huge number of unemployed have attracted many American manufacturers who feel that the economic panic is coming to Puerto Rico. These people hope that once they gain a foothold here, they will exploit Puerto Rican labor to minimize production costs and prevent themselves from going bankrupt when the "air" comes.

Last year, at a gathering of American businessmen at the San Juan Bank Club, a textile industrialist who was preparing to close his factory in New England and move to Puerto Rico revealed some words. While raising a glass to celebrate the prosperity of American business people in Puerto Rico, he said:

"This island is almost the last frontier of free enterprise. I don't know of any other place in the world where an entrepreneur can use his money so freely."

Indeed, the fact that American monopolistic bureaucrats have invaded the Puerto Rican legislature has made it a true paradise for Wall Street banks and companies. American industrialists receive subsidies from the local government budget to build new factories on the island. For twelve years, their business is exempt from all taxes.

Recently, the United States has publicized many plans to industrialize Puerto Rico. This plan has been implemented for eight years, and people have a basis for measuring its results! According to reports published in American newspapers at the end of May, the public "Industrial Development Company" currently has five factories, and the total number of workers is 992. Since they cannot compete with the goods of American monopolistic capitalists that are imported into Puerto Rico tax-free, these factories are not operating at full capacity and only work a few days a week.

It should also be mentioned the "land reform" that was loudly touted a few years ago. With the help of the "People's Party," which seized power, American trusts planned to use the "reform" to enrich themselves from the beginning. Now, it is clear that the only purpose of the plan is for those sugarcane companies to auction off their most barren land at the highest price. The few farmers who managed to acquire these lands found themselves even more bound by the sugar trusts than before the "reform."

Equally hypocritical is last year's "political reform," which created a puppet ruler for the island, who is tightly bound by colonial laws and completely subservient to sugar monopolistic capitalists.

The American colonial authorities are doing their best to stifle the people's national consciousness. They are destroying its national culture. The Spanish language, which has been used in Puerto Rico for 450 years, is being eradicated. Classes in almost all schools are taught in English. But no matter what, Puerto Ricans stubbornly resist Americanization. Under these circumstances, the Puerto Rican people are fighting for their economic and political rights, independence and freedom. Their struggle made significant progress during the Second World War, when 150,000 Puerto Ricans participated in the American army, and the United States promised them independence. However, the promise was not fulfilled. On the contrary, the colonial ruling institutions have become even tighter than before.

In February 1948, President Truman visited the capital of the island nation. At that time, the U.S. Navy held a large-scale exercise in the Caribbean Sea. The U.S. Navy regards Puerto Rico as one of its main naval bases in the Western Hemisphere. The President's visit was arranged with all the usual grand gestures and atmosphere: receptions, welcomes, and various banquets. The day he arrived was also declared a holiday, and all the police on the island were transferred to the capital. But regardless of official vigilance, the people held anti-imperialist demonstrations. Workers, students, and intellectuals participated. They demanded independence, opposed war propaganda, the Marshall Plan, and American interference in Latin American affairs.

The independence movement has spread to cities all over the island, even the most remote villages. On the 50th anniversary of the American invasion of Puerto Rico, the newly formed Independence Party convened a congress in the San Juan Stadium, attended by 15,000 people from hundreds of regions. They passed a progressive program, advocating genuine land reform, developing industry, and demanding Puerto Rican independence.

In Leopards, an organization fighting for independence convened local residents and farmers from nearby villages to hold a mass meeting of 50,000 people. There were also large gatherings in Mayaguez, Ponce, Atira, and Santos and elsewhere.

The Puerto Rican Communist Party occupies a prominent position in the struggle for independence. Not afraid of bans and terror, they are fighting bravely to liberate their country from colonial oppression. They support the progressive program of the Independence Party.

In 1948, a wave of strikes swept the island. Strikes broke out on sugarcane plantations and in many factories. In the summer, 8,000 dockworkers went on strike, completely paralyzing the shipping industry. In March, all 150,000 sugarcane plantation workers on the island went on strike, demanding higher meager wages and improved appalling working conditions.

Puerto Rican students also actively participated in the anti-imperialist movement. Last year, 6,000 students in San Juan participated in a strike movement. The police were called out to stop them; 500 police officers, armed with tear gas bombs, rushed into the school, arrested 70 students, and expelled 300. The school closed for that semester. The next semester began under police surveillance.

The Puerto Rican people are tightly gripped by iron rule and trampled by the oppression of American imperialism.

The so-called "elevating backward areas" solemnly announced by the United States is a major feature of American foreign policy. From the situation in Puerto Rico, we can see what its actual actions are. Puerto Rico has been a colony of the United States for fifty years. And today it is being exploited by thoroughly imperialistic, cruel, and greedy methods. American capital is using these methods on colonies all over the world.

　　波多黎加—美国的殖民地
    ——拉比斯基著  文涟、小凤合译
    波多黎加原文的意思是“富港”。这是西班牙人给这个位于加利比海口、大安得列斯群岛东部中的岛国起的名字。安得列斯群岛从古巴开始，环加利比海自东蜿蜒向南成弧状，直至委内瑞拉沿岸的特列尼达岛为止。除了古巴、海地和多明尼加三共和国外，这些岛屿分别为美、英、法、荷的殖民地。
    波多黎加是美国在这个区域中最大的属地。为哥仑布于一四九三年第二次到“新大陆”时所发现，那时岛上的印第安居民称它为“巴利君”。西班牙殖民始自十六世纪初叶，消灭土人、在很短时期内，六万印第安人几乎完全绝灭。到一七九七年，只剩下不到三千人了。西班牙人带着他们的非洲黑奴就在岛上住下来。
    西班牙军事总都们的专制统治，直到十九世纪初波多黎加人在他们争取解放的斗争中获得初次胜利时为止。那时，这个岛和许多欧洲和南美的国家有相当广泛的贸易，卖给他们咖啡、水果、糖、烟草和香料，买回他们的产品。
    一八九八年二月，在群众运动的压力下，波多黎加被允许成立自治政府，八个月以后，美国帝国主义侵入该岛，把它从西班牙的统治“解放”出来。于是美国的托辣斯底桎梏，代替了西班牙底桎梏。这个侵略带着粗陋的欺骗性的宣传，企图掩饰帝国主义的目的，而减少人民的反抗。美国占领军的司令，麦尔斯少将，宣称侵略者“拿着自由的旗帜”而进来，他们的唯一愿望是“赐予”波多黎加的人民以美国政府的“自由制度的好处”。这诺言履行得如何，从美国独占资本家统治波多黎加五十年的纪录中可以看见。
    　　　　×　　　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　　　　×
    波多黎加是一个小国，拥有面积八千八百九十七平方公里，人口二百一十一万三千。另有附属于它的已被美国据为海空军基地的凡基斯和古尔布拉小岛屿。占总人口百分之七十六的白种人中，西班牙移民的后代占绝大多数，黑人和混血儿占百分之二十。
    岛上的富源有金、锡、银、铂、铝、＠、铜、汞、优良大理石及其他有用的矿物，但是美国蓄意阻止工业发展，竭力保持它为取得廉价原料的殖民地。
    美国的糖业托拉斯已经使这岛国的整个经济成为畸形的。美国侵入的时候，波多黎加主要出产为咖啡，但同时也生产供应当地需要的主要食品。甘蔗种地占耕地面积不超过百分之十五。为了猎取利润，美国的独占资本家们已经把波岛变成一个取得廉价甘蔗的大种植园。他们已竭其全力使波多黎加人民成为他们永久的纳贡者，使他们只是原料的生产者，又是美国工业农业商品的消费者。
    美国蔗糖公司把五万个以上的农民从土地上赶走，将肥沃的平川最好的地占为己有。当普遍都感到土地异常缺乏的时候，十万亩以上的土地却掌握在地主们的手里，这些人从来没有来过波岛，或者是为视察这带给他们如此巨大利润的产业而偶尔来一次。
    根据一九四○年的国势调查，在全国有五万五千二百农庄，但百分之四十二的耕地属于与四个美国糖业托辣斯和几个银行有联系的大园主们。事实上，在几十个富有的波多黎加地主家的帮助下，摩根集团底糖业公司，控制了整个耕种地，奴役着农民和工人。被剥夺了土地的广大农民，构成低贱的劳动力底后备，在甘蔗园和几个工厂中残酷地被剥削着。约翰霍斯在美国的“读者观察”中写道：
    “用地道的帝国主义方式，我们破坏了以出口贸易为基础的波多黎加的经济。……我们占领了一个国家，它正在开始发展以向很多不同国家输出各种货品为基础的经济。……为了增加糖的生产，我们有系统的破坏了他的生产力，将他变成只有一种作物的经济”。
    美国的独占资本家们甚至于阻碍岛上炼糖业的发展。去年，由于糖业托拉斯的极力主张，美国通过了一法律，规定波多黎加糖得向美国输出九十一万吨，但有一特别规定，精炼的糖只准一十二万六千吨入口，其余必需以半成品输出，到美国来提炼。就只由这一措施，估计使波多黎加每年的国家收入损失二千至三千万美元；而四千以上的波多黎加人民因是而失业。
    加利福尼亚和佛罗利达的水果业大亨们，为了要避免竞争，使美国国会通过了一些法律，宣布波多黎加优良的橘子、葡萄和柠檬“不适合”输入美国。波多黎加的咖啡被输入巴西及古得马兰咖啡的美国入口商们排挤出了美国市场，他们妒妒地卫护着他们的垄断权。
    岛上人民的命运只有失业和饥饿。一个波多黎加的名人拉米路曾说：
    “北美政府又使用着它在美洲大陆消灭印第安人的方法来对付波多黎加。它以武力战胜了他们的抵抗，剥夺了他们的生路。……明显的，倔强的人民在北美帝国统治下，在它的旗子的影子下，病倒和死去。”
    　　　×　　　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　　×
    “优美的气候”，“蓝色的天空”，“三百公里明媚的海滩”，“旅行者的天堂”——为吸引有钱的观光者们注意的浓色广告是如此描绘波多黎加。
    那些游客们，坐着漂亮的船，到岛国的首都—圣胡安城。纽约煤矿与铁路大亨所建的作为美国有钱人避寒所的康得多饭店，以及美丽的热带风景，使这岛国给人繁荣的印象，饭店位于城外，远离那用破木箱和锡片搭成的可怜的小屋。观光者们欣赏着爱斯肯布隆。在它的两旁可发现别的现代化旅馆、鸡毛酒酒店、赌场、当地名流的俱乐部、娱乐场、及新式游泳设备的海滩。从他的车窗望出去，可以瞥见房屋拥挤的窄狭街道，在那儿，大多数的圣约翰居民，生活在异常不卫生的情况下；而他走向巴拉塞古隆，去参观哥仑布纪念碑。之后他又到礼拜堂去谒蓬塞得里昂墓。向圣约翰的高处，他可以看到美国富翁们（银行家、糖厂老板、纺织和饮料大王）的华丽别墅，有的是新英格兰殖民式，有的喜欢堪萨斯复兴建筑式。最后，参观了总督公馆（称为拉福得勒塞），及老摩罗宫或者美国警卫部队驻扎地—山克里士多坡堡；于是观光者心满意足的回到纽约、芝加哥、底特律或者堪萨斯城。
    波多黎加真正的生活与旅行社为有钱人所作的眩耀广告相差很远。联合通信社的利加沙塞利警告说：假如你到波多黎加去，“不要离开海滩太远，有些波多黎加人可能僵倒在你跟前；假如有人倒在地上的话，理由谨是饥饿。波多黎加现有二百万以上的人口，而大多数都饥饿至死。”
    居民的生活是穷困不堪的。波多黎加工人每年平均赚一百零八美元。在甘蔗园内工作的季节工人（普通每年只有四个月工做），每个星期挣五块钱；而面包、大米、和其他粮食与销费品，甚至比美国还贵得多。
    大批的失业是长期的。虽然美国代表送联合国的官方数字说大约波多黎加“只有”六千五百人失业，但实际上，约二十到三十万工人和季节工人觅求工作。
    失业、穷困、饥饿、疾病——这些就是美国帝国主义所带给波多黎加人民的。值得注意的就是在去年美国送交给联合国的报告中，虽然把它的殖民地和附属国的地位作有利的渲染，但也不得不承认波岛的人民患着“长期的营养不足”。报告称：“相当大数量的人们患着营养不良而往药店去”。
    我们可以加上一句：必要的医疗并没有实行。因为，在同一个报告里也承认：
    “岛上缺乏医生、护士和病床。受害于污灭、缺少食水、以及流行的痢疾、肠炎、肺炎、疟疾和性病。”
    报上所登载的数目字，透露了波多黎加肺病的百分率十倍于北加罗林那，儿童死亡率高于美国四十倍，而婴儿的死亡率更大。
    为了寻找生路，每年成万的波多黎加人移居美国。很多跑到纽约凄惨的贫民窟，但在那儿日子仍然不好过。任何人去看看在黑人区——东布隆克斯下半部及附近地区四千万这种移民的可怕生活情形就知道了。在破烂的房子里，三、四家人挤住一间脏房子里。种族的歧视，从他们到美国的第一天起就跟着他们。长年岁月寻找工作，最好的结果是得到那最吃力和工钱最低的职业。成万的波多黎加人经常拥进纽约日增一日的失业队伍。
    美国记者威廉布莱士，在他最近的著作，“南游——大河至巴塔哥尼亚”一书中曾记载了一些对波多黎加的印象。布莱士在研究这个美国殖民地的经济地位而发现它的可怕情形以后，得到的结论是：即使大批移民，也不能解救居民的饥饿。最后他对这个被美元王国奴役的人民的绝望前途，详加讨论，讥嘲地提出唯一解决方法，是强迫降低出生率，以减少人口。布莱士指出老达希地实行灭杀婴儿避免穷困的方法，他慈祥地说：
    “也许这样打算是不对的……但这一事实是避免不了的，即节制生育是主要的和最后的解决办法”。
    对美国的商人来说，他们甚至对这样巨大的计划也不费脑子。他们已惯于将波多黎加当作赚钱的投资场所。大量劳动力、低贱工资，以及巨量的失业者吸引了许多感到经济恐慌行将来临的美国制造家们往波多黎加。这些人希望，一旦在此立足，他们就以剥削波多黎加劳工来把生产成本减到最低限度，使自己在“气”时不至破产。
    去年，在圣胡安的银行俱乐部的美国商人集会上，一个准备将他在新英格兰的工厂歇业而搬到波岛的纺织业家流露了一些话。在举杯庆祝美国事业家在波多黎加的兴盛时，他说：
    “这个岛屿几乎是自由企业的最后边界，我不知道在世界上有任何其他地方，一个企业家可以如此运用他的金钱。”
    的确，美国独占资本官僚们侵入波多黎加立法机关的事实，已使它成为华尔街银行及公司的真正乐园。美国实业家从本地政府预算中得到补助金，来在岛上建立新的工厂。十二年来，他们的生意免交一切捐税。
    最近美国宣传了许多使波多黎加工业化的计划。该计划已经实行八年之久，人们有根据来估量其成果！根据五月底美国报纸上所载的报告，公营的“工业开拓公司”在目前有五个工厂，全部工人人数是九百九十二人。既然他们不能同免税输入波多黎加的美国独占资本家的商品竞争，这些工厂都未开全工，每星期仅工作几天。
    也应该提到数年前大吹大擂的“土地改革”。在夺得了政权的“民众党”的帮助下，美国托拉斯从开始就计划利用“改革”，来使他们自己发财。现在，很明显地，计划的唯一目的是那些蔗糖公司要以最高价拍卖出他们最瘦瘠的土地。少数设法取得这些土地的农民，却发现他们自己比“改革”以前更受糖业托拉斯所束缚。
    同样虚伪的是去年的“政治改革”，替岛国立了一个傀儡统治者，他被殖民地法律捆得紧紧的，完全屈服于糖业独占资本家。
    美国的殖民地当局极力扼杀人民的民族意识。他们正在摧毁其民族文化。在波多黎加运用达四百五十年的西班牙语言正在被根绝。差不多所有学校，上课都用英文。但是无论怎样，波多黎加人却顽强的反对美洲化。在这些情况下波多黎加入民正在为他们的经济和政治权利、独立与自由而战斗。他们的奋斗在第二次世界大战中已获得值得重视的进展，其时有十五万波多黎加人参加美国队伍，美国许诺其独立。然而诺言并未兑现。相反地，殖民地统治机构较前更加紧。
    一九四八年二月杜鲁门总统访问了岛国的首都。当时，美国海军在加利比海举行了大操演。美国海军把波多黎加视为它西半球主要海军基地之一。总统先生之访问，布置有一切常有的豪举与气氛：招待、欢迎以及各式各样的宴会。他抵达那一天还宣布放假，全岛的警察都调到首都来。但不管官方如何警戒，人民却举行了反帝示威游行。工人学生及知识分子都参加了。他们要求独立、反对战争宣传、马歇尔计划、以及美国对拉丁美洲事情的干涉。
    独立运动已经传布到岛上各城市，甚至于最偏僻的村庄。在美国侵略波多黎加五十周年那天，新近组成的独立党在圣胡安体育场召集了一个大会，到会一万五千人，来自几百个地区。他们通过了一个进步的纲领，主张真正土地改革、发展工业，要求波多黎加的独立。
    在利奥巴得斯，为独立而战斗的组织召集当地居民及附近村落农民，举行了一个五万人的群众大会。在迈阿圭司、蓬塞、阿地拉和圣多士及别的地方也有大集会。
    波多黎加共产党在争取独立斗争中占显要的地位，不怕取缔与恐怖，他们为了把他们的国家从殖民地压迫下解放出来而勇敢战斗着。他们支持独立党的进步纲领。
    一九四八年，罢工浪潮遍及全岛。在蔗糖种植园及许多工厂都发生罢工。夏季有八千码头工人罢工，使船运业完全瘫痪。三月里，所有岛上十五万蔗糖种植园工人罢工，要求提高可怜的工资，并改善触目惊心的工作条件。
    波多黎加的学生也积极参加了反帝运动。去年在圣胡安六千学生参加罢课运动。警察被叫出来制止他们；五百警察拿着催泪瓦斯弹，冲进学校，逮捕了七十个学生，开除了三百个。那一学期学校关了门。下一学期是在警察监视下开学。
    波多黎加人民被铁的统治紧扼着，被美国帝国主义的压迫所践踏着。
    美国郑重宣布的所谓提“高落后地区”是美国对外政策的主要特点，从波多黎加的情形，我们可以看到它的实际行动是什么了。波多黎加是美国的殖民地已五十年了。而今天正被彻头彻尾帝国主义的、残忍的、贪婪的方法剥削着。美国资本正是用这些方法施诸全世界各殖民地。
