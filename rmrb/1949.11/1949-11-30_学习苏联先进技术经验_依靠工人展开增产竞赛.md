　　Learning from the Advanced Technical Experience of the Soviet Union
  　Relying on Workers to Launch a Production Increase Competition

　　After reporting the above achievements, Jin Ce pointed out some shortcomings that must be overcome in industrial production. He said: In the past nine months, some departments, such as chemical, metal, mining, and electrical, have not completed the planned production quotas. The first reason is that the labor discipline in some factories is poor, and the leaders have not implemented the "sole management" system of the factory; the second is that some factories have not actively cultivated sufficient technical cadres, have not studied specific methods to ensure the replenishment of labor, and have implemented an unreasonable average wage system, resulting in labor mobility; the third is that the utilization rate of factory equipment capacity is still low, and there are frequent machine stoppages. Jin Ce then proposed ways to overcome the above shortcomings and made detailed explanations on reducing costs and saving raw materials. He said: In the future, each factory should organize a "production agreement council" composed of workers, staff, technicians, and trade union cadres to rely on the strength of the masses to correct shortcomings and overcome difficulties. Factory leaders should unite model workers and promote them to play a bridging and leading role. Jin Ce emphasized that the sincere help of advanced Soviet excellent and skilled technicians is a good condition for us to improve our technology and improve our work. We should open our minds and learn from Soviet friends again and again. At this point, Jin Ce called on all workers and technicians to launch a production increase competition movement, bravely create new methods, and listed many examples of labor heroes. For example, the work team led by Jin Bingri, a worker at the Xingnan Chemical Plant, completed the entire year's plan on September 14. In order to ensure working hours every day, his team goes to work half an hour early every day to prepare everything, and after work, they always organize all the equipment in an orderly manner. They maximize the use of machine capacity. In the past, workers in his team could only manage one heating furnace, but now one person can manage two to three. Finally, Jin Ce pointed out that the industrial sector should play a backbone leading role in the entire national economic plan and should not lag behind other sectors. Therefore, he asked all cadres to overcome shortcomings with a serious attitude and wage a merciless struggle against irresponsible work styles in order to win the victory of the two-year national economic plan.

### 学习苏联先进技术经验　依靠工人展开增产竞赛

　　学习苏联先进技术经验
  　依靠工人展开增产竞赛
    金策在报告以上成绩之后，指出了工业生产中必须予以克服的一些缺点。他说：过去九个月中，某些部门如化学、金属、矿业、电气计，还没有完成规定的生产等划。其原因第一是某些工厂中的劳动纪律较差，领导者没有执行工厂的“唯一管理”制；第二是部分工厂没有主动地培养足够的技术干部，没有研究保障劳动力补充的具体办法，并实行了不合理的平均的工资制度，以致造成劳动力的流动性；第三是工厂设备能力的利用率还低，常有机器停转的现象。金策接着提出克服上述缺点的办法，并对减低成本、节省原料等问题，作了详细的说明。他说：今后每个工厂，均应组织由工人、职员、技术人员、工会干部等参加的“生产协议会”，依靠群众力量，来纠正缺点，克服困难。工厂负责人应多团结模范工人，推动他们起桥梁和带头作用。金策着重指出：先进的苏联的优秀而熟练的技术人员对我们诚心诚意的帮助，是使我们提高技术、改进工作的良好条件。我们应该打开脑筋，向苏联友人学习学习再学习。至此，金策号召全体工人与技术人员，展开增产竞赛运动，奋勇创造新方法，并列举了许多劳动英雄的例子。如兴南化学工厂工人金炳日所领导的一个工作班，九月十四日就完成了今年全年的计划。他的班为要保证每天的工作时间，每天每人提前半小时上班，作好一切准备工作，下班后也一定将一切设备整理好，有条不紊。他们将机器能力利用到最大限度。他班上的工人，过去一人只能管一台加热炉，现在一人能管二台至三台。最后，金策指出，产业部门在整个人民经济计划中应起骨干带头作用，不应落在其它部门的后面。因此，他要求全体干部以严肃的态度，克服缺点，向那些不负责任的工作作风进行无情的斗争，以争取二年人民经济计划的胜利完成。
