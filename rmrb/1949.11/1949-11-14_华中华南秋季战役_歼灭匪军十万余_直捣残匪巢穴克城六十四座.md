Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 13th - The Fourth Field Army Headquarters of the People's Liberation Army has recently released a communique on the achievements of the autumn campaign, stating:

Our Fourth Field Army, alongside the fraternal Second Field Army, with the active coordination and support of people's guerrillas in Hunan and Guangdong, annihilated over 100,000 bandit troops and liberated 64 cities in the autumn campaign, achieving a great victory. In this campaign, our army advanced in three routes directly into the bandit strongholds of southern Hunan, western Hunan, and Guangdong to annihilate the bandits. On the western route, our army first advanced from Changde and Taoyuan in Hunan along the south bank of the Yuan River on September 13th, directly targeting Yuanling and Chenxi, and in one fell swoop occupied Zhijiang City, a strategic stronghold on the Hunan-Guizhou railway. This route of our army overcame all kinds of difficulties during its advance, traversing steep mountains and wading through deep waters, crossing the western Hunan mountainous region, defeating and largely annihilating the main force of the bandit Liu Jiashu's 17th Army Corps, opening the gateway to the borders of Sichuan, Guizhou, and Guangxi. On the central route, our army launched an offensive against the White bandits in Hengyang and its southwest region on October 3rd. The main force of the White bandits dared not engage and fled in panic from Hengyang towards the Hunan-Guangxi border. Our army immediately launched a pursuit, completely annihilating the four divisions of the White bandit's main force, the 7th Army and the 48th Army, in the Heng (yang) Bao (qing) Qi (yang) triangle area, and intercepted and annihilated a part of the bandit Huang Jie's Army Corps along the Baoqing-Wugang line. At the same time, the eastern route of our army also set out from southern Jiangxi and northern Guangdong on September 24th, advancing in multiple directions directly towards Guangzhou, crushing all defensive deployments of the bandit Yu Hanmou Group along the way, and liberating Guangzhou City, the largest city in South China, on the 14th. The defending enemy, in a state of panic, attempted to flee to the Leizhou Peninsula, Hainan Island, and Shantou, among other places. Our army, disregarding all fatigue, pursued the fleeing enemy relentlessly, persuading the bandit 103rd Division to lay down their weapons during the pursuit, and the 154th Division to accept peaceful reorganization. On the 26th, the fleeing enemy, the bulk of the 50th Army, 70th Army, 23rd Army, and 39th Army, were finally surrounded and annihilated in the Yangjiang area. By this point, the autumn campaign, lasting one month and thirteen days, had come to a victorious conclusion. A comprehensive report of the battle achievements is as follows:

    I. Annihilated 100,000 and 2,679 bandits, including 18,443 bandit officers and soldiers killed or wounded, 70,427 captured, 13,081 bandit troops who surrendered, and 728 who revolted.
