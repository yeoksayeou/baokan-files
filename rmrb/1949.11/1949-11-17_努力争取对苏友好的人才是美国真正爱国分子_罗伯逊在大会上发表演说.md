Robertson Delivers Speech at the Assembly:

　　Robertson was the second speaker. He described the Soviet Union as the defender of oppressed nations. He said: "The existence of the Soviet Union, the example it sets before the world of abolishing all discrimination based on skin color and ethnicity, its struggle on the world stage for true democracy and peace—all of this has made it possible for us black people to achieve complete liberation in our time, in this generation. I am reminded of how Mao Zedong, Chairman of the People's Republic of China, explained that China's liberation should be attributed to the influence of the Soviet Union in international affairs and the impact of the new balance of power; this new balance of power was caused by the defeat of Fascism, the birth of new democratic countries in Europe, the struggles of colonial peoples, and the struggles of the people in the capitalist world against their reactionary rulers." Robertson continued: "Despite all the censorship and suppression, the news that the Soviet Union is the true defender of oppressed nations, the news that the Soviet Union is a friend of the people of Africa and India, has spread and is spreading. I am proud to be listed among the loyal and reliable friends of the Soviet Union. As an artist, I know the significance of Soviet culture for young artists today, and I know what great ideals and creative prospects have unfolded in the Soviet land. As a black man and an American, I know the significance of Soviet democracy for our people and all oppressed peoples. As a 'person,' I know that the Soviet Union is working and striving for social progress and peace. Those who strive for a friendly policy towards the Soviet Union, and only those, are the true patriots of America. Others who seek to launch wars and destroy civilization are betraying the interests of our country and the American people." The audience responded to Robertson's enthusiastic speech with warm applause.

　　Warren, Professor of Economics at Amherst College, said in his speech: "American-Soviet friendship is the most important issue today." He vehemently criticized the current anti-Soviet hysteria in the United States and the malicious attacks on those who advocate American-Soviet friendship.

　　Professor Emeritus Ward of the Federal Theological Seminary said that the United States' loss of its monopoly on the atomic bomb and the decline in industrial production exposed the bankruptcy of American "Cold War" diplomacy. The establishment of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China has enabled hundreds of millions more people to join the "World Peace League," which definitively indicates that if those who delusionally believe they can prevent the advance towards a socialist society dare to rashly launch an atomic war, or launch this war out of desperation and fear, they will have no possibility of victory.

　　努力争取对苏友好的人才是美国真正爱国分子
    罗伯逊在大会上发表演说
    第二个发表演说的是罗伯逊。他描述苏联是被压迫民族的捍卫者。他说：“苏联的存在，它在世界面前树立的废除一切基于肤色和民族歧视的榜样，它在世界舞台上为争取真正的民主与和平而作的斗争——这一切已经使我们黑人有可能在我们的时代里，就是在这一代里，获得完全解放。我想起中华人民共和国主席毛泽东怎样解释中国的解放应归功于苏联在国际事务上的影响及新的力量对比上的影响；而这种新的力量对比，是由于法西斯主义的失败，欧洲新民主国家的诞生，殖民地人民的斗争，和资本主义世界人民反对他们的反动统治者的斗争所造成的。”罗伯逊接着说：“尽管一切新闻检查和扣压，苏联是被压迫民族的真正捍卫者的消息，苏联是非洲和印度人民的朋友的消息，已经传播开来，并且正在传播着。我被列在苏联的忠实可靠的朋友之列，我感到骄傲。作为一个艺术工作者，我知道苏联文化对今日的青年艺术工作者的意义，知道苏维埃国土上展开了多么伟大的理想和创作的远景。作为一个黑人和美国人，我知道苏联的民主对于我国人民和一切被压迫人民的意义。作为一个‘人’，我知道苏联是为社会的进步与和平而工作和努力。那些努力争取对苏友好政策的人，而且只有那些人，是美国的真正爱国分子。另外一些力谋发动战争，毁灭文明的人，则是出卖了我们国家和美国人民的利益。”听众对罗伯逊热情的演说，报以热烈的欢呼。
    安姆赫斯学院经济学教授华恩发表演说称：“美苏友谊是现今最重要的问题。”他猛烈批评现在美国国内反苏歇斯底里的空气和对于主张美苏友好者的恶毒攻击。
    联邦神学院名誉教授华德说，美国之丧失原子弹的独占，以及工业生产下降，暴露了美国“冷战”外交的破产。中华人民共和国中央人民政府的成立，使又有数亿人参加了“世界和平联盟”，这确凿地表示，如果那些妄想自己能够阻止走向社会主义社会的人，竟敢冒然发动原子战争，或因绝望和恐惧而竟发动这个战争，他们是没有胜利的可能的。”
