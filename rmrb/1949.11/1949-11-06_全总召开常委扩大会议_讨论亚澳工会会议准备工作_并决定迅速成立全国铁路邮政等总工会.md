Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 5th: The All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU) convened an enlarged meeting of its Standing Committee on the 4th to discuss preparations for the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference and issues such as convening a representative meeting of the China Labor Association.

Regarding the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference, ACFTU Vice Chairman Liu Ningyi reported that before the opening of the conference, an executive bureau meeting of the World Federation of Trade Unions would be held in Beijing from the 11th to the 13th of this month. The meeting would mainly discuss four issues: (1) the implementation of the resolutions of the Second World Federation of Trade Unions Congress; (2) a summary and review of the role of the world people's democratic movement in defending world peace on the October 2nd International Day of Peace; (3) the World Federation of Trade Unions' action plan for the United Nations; and (4) issues related to the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference.

Regarding the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference, there will be 150 to 200 delegates, including 58 trade union representatives from China and approximately 100 trade union representatives from other countries in Asia and Australia. The preparation work for the conference is mainly the responsibility of the Chinese side, including publishing booklets, pictorials, and various reports related to the conference, including the ACFTU's report on the Chinese workers' movement to the conference. According to Liu Ningyi's notification, the Standing Committee's enlarged meeting stipulated two tasks for welcoming the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference: (1) In terms of propaganda, publish pictorials of the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference, hold exhibitions related to the Asian and Australian labor movements, and compile and print various books and periodicals in Chinese and foreign languages; (2) The ACFTU will issue notices to trade unions across the country regarding the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference, strengthen internationalist education among workers in various regions, and notify the general trade unions in Beijing, Shenyang, Tianjin, Shanghai, and the National Railway Trade Union to prepare to welcome representatives from various countries to visit.

Regarding the issue of the Labor Association convening a national representative meeting, ACFTU Vice Chairman Zhu Xuefan reported that the China Labor Association had completed its historical mission. At the preparatory meeting of the Labor Association representatives held on the 3rd, the representatives of the Labor Association from various regions unanimously requested the termination of the Labor Association. In the future, members of the China Labor Association will participate in the various industrial trade unions and local trade unions under the leadership of the ACFTU as members, to further strengthen the unity of the Chinese working class organization. The Standing Committee's enlarged meeting unanimously agreed to Vice Chairman Zhu's notification and expressed great welcome.

Finally, the Standing Committee's enlarged meeting made the following decisions:

(1) To quickly complete the organization of the national working class, it is first necessary to organize the national industrial workers. The preparatory committees of the established National Railway Trade Union, National Postal Trade Union, and National Telecommunications Trade Union are instructed to actively carry out preparatory work, stipulating that national congresses of railway, postal, and telecommunications trade unions be convened separately before March next year to formally establish national railway, postal, telecommunications and other trade unions, and it was decided to establish working committees for national textile, coal, hardware, food, culture and education, publishing, light industry, and other industrial trade unions, as well as a working committee for national shop assistants.

(2) The notice of convening a national seafarers' trade union work conference in December this year was approved.

(3) Hou Yutian was appointed as the Second Deputy Minister of the Labor Protection Department of the ACFTU, Feng Suhai as the Second Deputy Minister of the Culture and Education Department of the ACFTU, and Xu Xuan as the Second Deputy Director of the Policy Research Office of the ACFTU.
