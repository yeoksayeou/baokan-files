All-China Federation of Trade Unions Sends Congratulations to the Beijing Women's Congress
(Beijing News) The All-China Federation of Trade Unions sent a congratulatory telegram to the first Beijing Women's Congress. The telegram reads as follows: To the First Beijing Women's Congress:
We, on behalf of the national working class, extend our warmest congratulations to the Congress with the greatest excitement and joy! We pay tribute to the heroes, meritorious individuals, and all outstanding workers on the front lines of combat and production and construction.
The convocation of the first Beijing Women's Congress, representing one million women, not only demonstrates the unity of women from all walks of life in China, but also signifies that Chinese women have truly broken free from the shackles of feudalism and begun to enjoy the sacred rights conferred upon them by their own country. This right can only be enjoyed under the people's democratic dictatorship led by Chairman Mao Zedong. There is no doubt that after the Congress, the women of New Beijing will gain greater and higher status and acclaim for their greater contributions to national construction.
We wish the Congress success!
Respectfully, All-China Federation of Trade Unions

　　全国总工会电贺京妇代会
    【北京讯】中华全国总工会，电贺北京市首届妇女代表大会，电文如下：北京市首届妇女代表大会：
    我们代表全国工人阶级以最大的兴奋和喜悦向大会致热烈祝贺！向在战斗、生产建设战线上的英雄、功臣和一切优秀的工作者们致敬。
    代表着一百万妇女的首届京市妇女代表大会的召开，不仅说明了中国各界妇女团结起来，她还标志着中国的妇女真正从封建的锁链下解脱出来，而开始享受着自己国家所赋予的神圣权利，而这种权利，只有在以毛泽东主席为首人民民主专政的政权之下才能享受，新北京的妇女在大会以后，将会以你们对国家建设的更重大的贡献而获得更大的、更高的地位称誉，那是毫无疑问的。
    预祝大会成功！
    　　　　　　　　　　　　中华全国总工会敬贺
