　　Private Industry in Northeast China
    Ma Hengzhi
    Economic construction is the overriding central task for the Northeast Liberated Area in the future, with the recovery and development of state-owned industry as the priority, especially heavy industry, which will be the focus of future economic construction. However, how to leverage the positive role of private industry in the recovery and development of industry in Northeast China is a question worth studying.

    Northeast China's private industry gradually declined after the enemy and puppet regime implemented economic control in 1940. After August 15th, the southern Manchurian cities were looted by the Kuomintang, and industrial production almost completely stopped. It was not until the complete liberation of Northeast China at the end of 1948 that private industry was able to recover and develop with the support of the People's Government.

    Currently, according to incomplete statistics from January 1949 (excluding the Lushun-Dalian area), there are approximately 70,000 private industrial enterprises in Northeast China, employing more than 200,000 workers. Statistics from the puppet Manchukuo era (1940) show a total of 10,562 factories with 170,243 workers. Therefore, the number of private industrial enterprises and workers in Northeast China has increased compared to the past.

    We can see the specific development situation from the industrial statistics of Shenyang and Harbin. (See Table 1)

    Table 1: Comparison of Private Industry in Shenyang City between the Puppet Manchukuo (1940) and the Present (June 1949)

| Timber Industry | 121                 | 544     | 1,964            | 1,630   |

    As can be seen from the table above, the number of private industrial enterprises in Shenyang has increased nearly sixfold compared to the past, but the number of workers has not increased as much. From an industry perspective, the most prominent development after liberation is in handicrafts, where the number of workers has increased from 310 to 3,390. Next is the chemical industry, where the number of workers has increased from 1,162 to 3,564; and the food industry, where the number of workers has increased from 2,933 to 4,221. Other industries, such as ironwork, textiles, and pottery, have not yet caught up with the past.

    Harbin was liberated earlier and developed faster. In the past, there were 22,362 workers, and now there are 37,007. From an industry perspective, industries that did not exist in the puppet Manchukuo era but have developed after liberation include matches, soda ash (caustic soda), and some emerging industries. The most significant development is in the textile industry, where the number of workers has increased from 3,167 to 10,933; followed by soaps, waxes, fur, lumber, grain processing, oil production, and ironwork. Only the pottery industry has not recovered to its past levels. (See Table 2)

| Total           | 1,546               | 10,865  | 22,362          | 57,007  |

    The fact that private industry has achieved such development is, of course, due to the breaking of the shackles of imperialist economic control and the opening of a vast market in the liberated areas. However, one of the main factors is the government's assistance. For example, in Harbin, 62.4% of the city's industrial workforce is employed in industries that have developed with the government's supply of raw materials. These industries include food, grain processing, textiles, timber, and fur. Industries that have developed with the government's assistance in the form of processing include the clothing industry, which utilizes all of its productive capacity (47 enterprises, 1,669 workers); the iron industry, which utilizes 14.4% of its productive capacity (71 machine tools); and the leather shoe industry, which utilizes 24% of its productive capacity (134 enterprises, 2,459 workers). Other processed products include matches, soybean oil, flour, and cigarettes. The same is true in Shenyang. In addition to helping solve difficulties such as raw material supply, the government also uses processing to support the recovery of private industry production. For example, the clothing industry utilizes all of its productive capacity (1,614 machines); the textile industry utilizes 4.4% of its productive capacity (147 looms); the iron industry utilizes 4.6% of its productive capacity (192 machines); and machine dyeing utilizes 40.1% of its dyeing vats (170 units).

    However, this development, generally speaking, is not an expansion of production scale, but a new change in production organization, shifting from concentration to dispersion. We can clearly see this issue from the degree of worker concentration in Shenyang and Harbin (comparison between the present and the past). (See Table 3)

    Table 3: Shenyang City

| 50 or more workers    | 29                   | 38                  | 3,957            | 3,054            |
| 21-49 workers          | 160                  | 91                  | 4,797            | 2,673            |
| 7-20 workers           | 877                  | 799                 | 9,972            | 8,261            |
| 1-6 workers            | 482                  | 6,519               | 2,213            | 17,860           |
| Independent Laborers    |                      | 4,486               |                      | 7,003            |
| Total                  | 1,494               | 2,933               | 20,939           | 38,852           |

    As can be seen from the table above, the number of factories in Shenyang with 50 or more workers was 88 in 1940, but only 24 in 1949. The number of factories with 10-49 workers increased from 761 to 853. The most significant development was in factories with 9 or fewer workers, which numbered 559 in 1940 and 8,850 in 1949. In Harbin, the number of industries with 6 or fewer workers has greatly developed, both in terms of the number of enterprises and the number of workers. Factories with 7 or more workers have decreased.

    In this context, let's take another look at the production methods of private industry in Harbin. (See Table 4)

    Table 4: Private Industry in Harbin

| Production Method  | Number of Enterprises | Percentage | Number of Workers | Percentage |
|--------------------|-----------------------|------------|--------------------|------------|
| Powered Machinery   | 1,210               | 10.2       | 8,233            | 24.6       |
| Manual Machinery   | 1,427               | 12.0       | 8,589            | 25.9       |
| Manual Workshops   | 1,407               | 11.8       | 7,028            | 21.3       |
| Handicraft Workers  | 3,071               | 25.7       | 7,779            | 13.5       |
| Cottage Industry    | 4,248               | 35.5       | 4,768            | 14.5       |
| Other/Unspecified   | 570                 | 4.8        | 63               | 0.2        |
| Total              | 2,933               | 100        | 33,060           | 100        |

    (Note) The number of workers in this table does not match the figures in Table 1 due to errors in the original statistics.

    Only 10.2% of enterprises and 24.6% of workers can be considered modern industry. Manual factories account for 23.8% of the number of enterprises. The number of workers accounts for 47.2%, and transitional manual factories account for half of the number of workers. Handicraft and cottage industries, with their backward production methods, account for 61.2% of the number of enterprises and 28% of the number of workers.

    What caused this development in private industry?

    First, the relationship between private industry's past dependence on imperialism and its service to the imperialist colonial economy has been broken. A new economic system has not yet developed, and we are in a time of war, which has led to a lack of industrial raw materials. Therefore, larger industries cannot maintain their production and have to reduce their scale of production. On the other hand, due to the needs of the war and the people, there is a shortage of daily necessities. Therefore, people with some technical knowledge gather in groups of three or five to start factories, with small capital and large profits, such as textiles, matches, soap, toothbrushes, and chemical industrial products.

    Second, in the past, prices were unstable, and commercial speculation was more profitable than industrial production. Most funds were diverted to commerce for speculative trading, and a small portion of funds was invested in industry – directed towards simple, easy-to-make industries with quick capital turnover.

    Third, there were deviations in the implementation of industrial policies, such as insufficiently adjusted public-private relations and sometimes improperly and untimely resolved labor-capital relations, which made capitalists reluctant to expand production.

    In the past, due to the blind development of private industry, there was a significant surplus of its productive capacity. For example, in Harbin, more than 50% of industrial productive capacity was surplus: ironwork was surplus by about 60%, textiles by 80%, soaps/waxes by 40%, matches by 50%, and grain processing by 80.5% (the above ratios refer to the ratio of maximum production capacity to actual production). Shenyang's surplus was: iron industry 43%, weaving 70%, electrical equipment 59%, and lumber 41% (the above refers to unused machines). Therefore, many enterprises in some industries reported closures. Currently, due to the occurrence of new situations: the gradual restoration of national transportation, the commencement of domestic material exchange, etc., the issue of the future development direction of private industry in Northeast China has been raised. Faced with cheap and high-quality daily necessities and equipment from Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and other places, how private industry in Northeast China will exist, how it will divide labor with national industry, and how it will take effective steps to compete with it are all issues that private industrial entrepreneurs in Northeast China should seriously consider.

    The above is the development of private industry in Northeast China since liberation and its characteristics.

    What is the position of private industry in the overall Northeast industry? According to materials from 1949, it is estimated that the total output value of private industry accounts for about 12.5% of the total industrial output value of Northeast China, which is a relatively small proportion. Therefore, some people say: "Private capitalism has no future." Yes, there is no future for private industry to take the road of capitalism. If it develops in a direction that is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood under the path planned by the new democratic economy under the leadership of the working class, then there is a future. Facts have already proven this point. The question is how we lead and support it. For all private industries that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, we must guide their direction of operation and development to reduce their blind production. In particular, guide them to face the countryside and combine with the needs of the peasants. Help them overcome the difficulties of raw material supply, finished product sales, transportation, and transformation, correct the past laissez-faire attitude towards private industry and certain inappropriate restrictions, and support their proper development. We must guide and support the proper development of private industry in terms of pricing policies, taxation policies, and labor policies, so that it can implement government decrees, give full play to its production enthusiasm, and move forward along the economic road of new democracy!

　　东北的私营工业
    马恒志
    经济建设是东北解放区今后压倒一切的中心任务，而首先恢复与发展的是国营工业，特别重工业是今后经济建设的重点。不过，在恢复与发展东北工业中，如何发挥私人工业的积极作用，是值得研究的一个问题。
    东北的私营工业，从一九四○年敌伪实行经济统制以后，便日趋破产。八一五后，南满各城市又遭国民党的洗劫，工业生产几乎完全停顿。迄一九四八年底东北全部解放，私营工业才在人民政府的扶助下，得到恢复与发展。
    目前东北私营工业，据一九四九年一月份不完全的统计（不包括旅大地区），家数约有七万多，工人二十余万名。伪满时代（一九四○年）统计，工厂共有一○、五六二家，工人一七○、二四三名。因此，目前东北私营工业的家数及工人数比过去都增加了。
    具体的发展情况，我们从沈、哈两市的工业统计中可以看出。（见第一表）
    第一表：沈阳市私营工业伪满（一九四○年）与现在（一九四九年六月）情况比较表项别           家数　　　　　　　　　　工人数时期      伪满　　现在　　　　　伪满　　　　　现在行业别铁工业　　三○五　二、一四五　　九、七三一　　八、三五一纺织工业　二六六　一、一三六　　六、四八八　　五、三六一化学工业　一一四　七九七　　　　一、一六二　　三、五六四窑业　　　七六　　七三　　　　　三、四三七　　六三三食品业　　一三八　九九四　　　　二、九三三　　四、二二一燃料工业　——　　一　　　　　　——　　　　　四印刷业　　六九　　一六九　　　　一、四三一　　九七一木材工业　一二一　五四四　　　　一、九六四　　一、六三○杂工业　　二九一　二、三七一　　三、四八四　　七、二六二手工业　　二八　　一、四九六　　三一○　　　　三、三九○其他矿业　——　　一　　　　　　——　　　　　一○合计　　一、四○八　九、七二七　三二、九四一　三五、三九七
    从上表看出，沈阳市私人工业，在家数上比过去增加了将近六倍，工人数却没有增加多少，从行业上看，解放后发展得最突出的，首为手工业，过去工人是三一○名，现在竟有工人三三九○名。次为化学工业，过去之工人是一一六二名，现在有工人三五六四名；食品工业过去工人是二九三三名，现在有四二二一名，其他各行业，如铁工、纺织、窑业等，都未赶得上过去的情况。
    哈尔滨解放的时间较长，发展的也快，过去工人有二二、三六二名，现在有工人三七、○○七名了。从行业上看，伪满时没有而解放后发展起来的，有火柴、制碱（火碱）还有些新兴的工业。发展得最显著的是纺织业，过去有工人三一六七名，现在有一○、九三三名；其次是胰蜡、毛皮、制材、粮谷加工业、制油及铁工业。只有窑业未恢复到过去的情况。（见第二表）
    第二表：哈尔滨市私营工业伪满（一九四○年）与现在（一九四九年一月）情况比较表项别　　　　　　家数　　　　　　　　　　　工人数时期　　　伪满　　　　现在　　　　　伪满　　　　　现在行业别铁工业　　二八九　　　九四六　　　　三、七九○　　四、二四六纺织工业　一七六　　　三、三三○　　三、一六七　　一○、九三三窑业　　　一二四　　　五六　　　　　二、九三三　　一、二三七火柴业　　——　　　　四一　　　　　——　　　　　三八六制油　　　二五　　　　二六　　　　　七八四　　　　八九四胰蜡　　　八　　　　　一三二　　　　五○　　　　　四五二制碱　　　——　　　　一二四　　　　——　　　　　四五九毛皮　　　二四　　　　三三七　　　　三五九　　　　七二三制粉　　　八　　　　　六　　　　　　三一九　　　　三三一粮谷加工　三六　　　　四五二　　　　三五五　　　　一、一四三制材　　　三七　　　　五九　　　　　一九○　　　　六一七其他　　　八○九　　　五、三五六　　一○、四五一　一五、五八六合计　　　一、五四六　一○、八六五　二二、三六二　五七、○○七
    私营工业能得到如此的发展，固然是由于帝国主义的经济统制枷锁被打碎了，解放区内开辟了广大的市场。但是其中一个主要的因素是因为政府的帮助，例如，哈尔滨市，占全市职工人数百分之六二·四的工业，是由政府供给原料而得到发展的。这些工业包括食品业、粮谷加工业、纺织业、木材业、皮毛业等行业。政府用加工形式帮助发展起来的行业：例如被服业使用了全部的生产力（四七家，一、六六九名工人）；铁工业使用了百分之一四·四的生产力（车床七一台）；皮鞋业使用了百分之二四的生产力（一三四家，二、四五九名工人）；织布业使用了百分之六三·一的生产力（共有二、二九二台织布机）。其他加工的还有火柴、豆油、面粉、纸烟……等。沈阳市亦然，政府除了帮助解决原料等困难问题外，还用加工形式扶助私营工业恢复的生产：例如被服业使用了全部生产力（一、六一四台机器）；纺织业使用了百分之四·四的生产力（一四七台织布机）；铁工业使用了百分之四·六的生产力（一九二台机器）；机器漂染使用了百分之四○·一的染槽（一七○台）。
    但是这种发展，一般的说，不是生产规模的扩大，而是在生产组织上的一种新的变化，由集中趋向分散。我们可以从沈、哈两市工人集中程度（现在与过去的比较）很清楚的看出这个问题。（见第三表）

    从上表看出，沈阳市五○人以上的工厂，一九四○年八八家，一九四九年只有二四家了。一○——四九人的工厂家数由七六一家增到八五三家。而发展最多的是九人以下的工厂，一九四○年是五五九家而四九年成为八、八五○家了。哈尔滨市六人以下的工业不论在家数上与在工人数目上都大大的发展了，七人以上的工厂却减少了。
    在这种情况下我们再看看哈市私营工业的生产方式。（见第四表）

    （注）此表之工人数与一表之数字不相符合，系原统计上的错误。
    够得上近代化工业的，只有百分之一○·二家，工人百分之二四·六。手工工厂在家数上占百分之二三·八。工人数占百分之四七·二，过渡性的手工工厂，在工人数上则占一半。手工业及家庭工业，落后的生产方式家数则占百分之六一·二，工人数则占百分之二八。
    什么原因造成私营工业这种发展情况呢？
    第一，私营工业过去依赖于帝国主义及为帝国主义殖民地经济服务的关系被打破了，而新的经济体系还没有发展起来，我们又是处在战争时期，以致于工业原料等，都感缺乏，因此，较大的工业不能维持其生产，不得不缩小生产规模。另一方面，由于战争与人民的需要，日用品都感缺乏，因此，过去懂得点技术的人，就三、五个人凑在一起，开起工厂来。本钱少利益又大，如纺织、火柴、肥皂、牙刷、化学工业品等。
    第二，过去物价不稳定，商业投机比工业生产利益大的多。大部资金都转向商业作投机买卖，少部分资金投入工业——投向简单易作，资金周转快的工业上去。
    第三，工业政策执行的有偏差，如公私关系调整的不够好，劳资关系有时没有恰当及时的解决，使资本家不敢放心扩大生产。
    过去由于私营工业盲目性的发展，造成它的生产力有很大的剩余，例如哈尔滨市便有百分之五十以上的工业生产力过剩：铁工过剩约百分之六十，纺织百分之八十，胰蜡百分之四十，火柴百分之五十，粮谷加工百分之八十·五（以上之比率是指最大生产能力与实际生产量之比）。沈阳市过剩——铁工业百分之四十三，织布百分之七十，电工器材百分之五十九，制材百分之四十一（以上是指未开动的机器而言）。因此有些行业报歇业的家数很多。目前由于新的情况的发生：全国交通逐渐恢复，国内物资开始交流等，更向东北私营工业提出了今后发展方向的问题。在京津上海等地来的日用品及器材，价廉物美的情况下，东北私营工业如何存在，如何与全国工业分工，如何采取有效步骤与之比赛，这些都是值得东北私营工业者认真考虑的问题。
    以上便是东北解放以来，私营工业发展的情况及其特点。
    私营工业在整个的东北工业中占什么地位呢？根据一九四九年的材料，估计私营工业生产总值约占全东北工业生产总值的百分之十二点五，其比重是较少的。因此有人说：“私人资本主义没有发展前途”。是的，让私营工业走资本主义的道路是没有前途的，如果在工人阶级领导下的新民主主义经济所规划的道路向有利于国计民生的方向发展，那是有前途的。事实已经证明了这一点。问题是在于我们如何领导它扶助它，对于一切有利于国计民生的私营工业，必须指导其经营与发展的方向，以减少其盲目性的生产。特别指导它们面向农村，与农民的需要结合。帮助它们克服原料供给，成品推销，运输与转业的困难，改正过去对私营工业自流态度与某些不适当的限制，扶助它们的正当发展。我们必须在物价政策上，税收政策上，劳动政策上，引导与扶助私营工业的正当发展，使它贯彻政府法令，发挥其生产的积极性，循着新民主主义的经济道路前进！
