    Tianjin and Luoyang Business Circles
    Hold Talks to Establish Trade Relations

    [Special Dispatch from Tianjin by Our Newspaper] The Tianjin Industrial Circle's newly established Urban-Rural Materials Exchange Guidance Committee held a symposium yesterday morning with the Luoyang industrial and commercial delegation to discuss the establishment of trade relations between the two regions in the future, the exchange of materials, and mutual assistance in procurement and sales. About forty people from both sides attended the meeting. After the representatives of private factories in Tianjin, such as dyeing and weaving machinery, rubber, and matches, reported on the production and sales situation of their respective industries, the Luoyang delegation was divided into groups for discussions and exchanges of opinions. Luoyang only has more than 2,000 industrial enterprises, most of which are handicraft workshops, so there is an urgent need for small-scale mechanized industries. They are very interested in industries such as oil pressing, dyeing and weaving, matches, soap making, and flour milling, and plan to take the machine drawings of the above industries back for reference and research. Luoyang produces a lot of cotton, soybeans, peanuts, and sulfur, and also hopes that the Tianjin industrial community will go to purchase them.

    天津洛阳工商界
    座谈建立贸易关系
    【本报天津专电】天津工业界新成立的城乡物资交流指导委员会昨晨与洛阳工商业代表团举行座谈会，商讨建立今后两地的贸易关系，物资交流，互相帮助采购、推销诸问题。与会双方约四十余人，开会后由津市染织机器、橡胶、火柴等私营厂商代表分别报告各该业的产销情形后，继洛阳代表团分成小组座谈交换意见，洛阳方面的工业只两千多家，其中以手工作坊占多数，故急需小型机制工业。对榨油、染织、火柴、造胰、磨面等工业都感到兴趣，准备将以上工业机器图样带回参考研究。洛阳方面产棉花、大豆、花生、硫磺很多，也希望津方工业界前往采购。
