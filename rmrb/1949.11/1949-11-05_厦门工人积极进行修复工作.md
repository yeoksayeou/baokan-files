    [Report from this newspaper] Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Workers in Xiamen are actively engaged in various repair tasks. On the day of Xiamen's liberation, dockworkers spontaneously organized to repair the heavily damaged No. 1 dock, which had been severely damaged by the Kuomintang bandit troops during the war. They transported over 300 stones, each weighing five to six hundred pounds, by manpower from a distance of half a kilometer to repair the ferry dock, completing the entire repair in just four days. Repair workers from the water company repaired a water-carrying vessel with a capacity of 120 tons in four days, quickly solving the drinking water problem for the residents of Gulangyu.

　　厦门工人
  　积极进行修复工作
    【本报讯】新华社消息：厦门市工人积极进行各种修复工作。厦门市解放当日，码头工人即自动组织起来抢修在战争中被国民党匪军严重破坏的第一号码头。他们从一里路外用人力搬运每块重五六百斤的石头三百余块来修建轮渡码头，仅四天即将码头全部修竣。自来水公司的修理工人在四天内即修好一艘载重一百二十吨的运水船，迅速解决了鼓浪屿居民的饮水问题。
