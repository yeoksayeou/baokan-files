　　Children's League Member Lou Chengxuan and His Group
　　　　Ye Min
　　--The victory of the great People's Liberation War is the crystallization of the blood and sweat of millions of working people, including children.
　　On the morning of February 24, 1947, the Children's League of Loujiapu (a small village in Zengcun District, Yiyuan County, newly established in Shandong) was once again grinding grain as usual; a chaotic and clear clamor echoed from inside the house. With curiosity, I immediately forgot the fatigue of the continuous days of marching, quickly put on my clothes, and walked to the courtyard.
　　"Which of you is the leader of the Children's League?" I asked kindly.
　　"The leader lives on the mountain and hasn't come down yet," a very small child replied.
　　"The leader hasn't come yet, who told you to grind grain? The Children's League can't have liberalism!" Obviously, my criticism was a joke. However, Lou Chengxuan, the leader of the Children's League group, took it seriously. With a serious face, he explained to me: "Comrade, do you know that our Children's League has already made a plan, and it's our group's turn to grind grain today!"
　　Lou Chengxuan's group has a total of six people. He himself is the oldest, thirteen years old. The youngest is Lou Shulan, eight years old. The other four are also only twelve years old. Two of them push, three pull, and one takes turns to rest and add grain, busying themselves energetically. When they are happy or tired, they spontaneously sing "The democratic government loves the people, the Communist Party's kindness is endless, ya hu hai hai yi hu ya hai..."
　　The children are very serious about their work. When I suggested teaching them songs, the group leader replied: "Learning songs now will distract us. We'll ask you to teach us after we've completed our task!"
　　It was Lou Chengshu's turn to rest, but she didn't come down immediately, waiting until everyone shouted, "Lou Chengshu, take a rest!" before she reluctantly came down; but soon she went to find a child named Lou Chengzhao and said, "Let's switch!" But Lou Chengzhao replied straightforwardly, "No switch, I haven't even sweated yet, why switch?" They often argued about this.
　　Lou Chengxuan himself is pulling at the very front. Once he gets on the millstone, he's like a hunchback, never straightening his waist. The child Lou Chengshan pointed to a tattered padded jacket next to the mill and said to me: "Look, our group leader's jacket is torn!" In fact, the shoulders of his single shirt were also torn, and from the opening you could clearly see that his two small shoulders had developed a thick layer of "calluses"! Sand, fine chaff, and sweat covered his small face, and hot air puffed out. He was very tired, but he never thought of resting. He called on everyone: "Today we must complete the task and not fall behind!" The children all responded naively and enthusiastically: "If we don't complete the task, we won't sleep tonight!"
　　The children's enthusiasm is truly moving. Comrade Chen Jinshan, the newly liberated communication worker, said repeatedly: "No wonder the People's Liberation Army is always winning battles. Even the children in the liberated areas have been mobilized!" I couldn't help but say: "Little brothers and sisters, take a break, you are really too tired!" The children answered in unison: "What's tiring? Everyone is supporting the front line to fight Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, can our Children's League lag behind?" Look! How proud and arrogant are the new children taught by Mao Zedong!
　　In the afternoon, I learned some rather surprising, but very true figures from the village cadres, namely that since the Laiwu Victory, in seven or eight days, the Children's League has ground more than 1,200 catties of millet for the front, almost undertaking all the rice milling work in the village.

　　儿童团员娄承宣和他的小组
    野民
    ——伟大的人民解放战争的胜利，是千百万劳动人民自己的血汗的结晶，其中也有儿童们的。
    一九四七年二月二十四日清早，娄家铺（为山东新设的沂源县曾村区的一个小村子）的儿童团照例又在推碾了；杂乱而清危的喧哗声，一阵阵地传进屋子里来。我怀着好奇的心情，顿时忘掉了连日行军的疲劳，迅速地披起衣服，向院子里走去。
    “你们中间谁是儿童团长？”我亲切地问道。
    “团长在山上住，还没下来呢。”一个顶小的儿童回答说。
    “团长还没来，谁叫你们推碾？儿童团可不能自由主义呀！”很显然，我这个批评是开玩笑的。但是，儿童团小组长娄承宣却认真起来了。他板着小脸向我解释说：“同志，你知不知道，咱们儿童团早订好计划的呀，今天该轮着俺这个小组推碾！”
    娄承宣这个小组一共是六个人，他自己最大，十三岁。最小的一个叫娄树兰，八岁。其余四个也都只是十二岁。他们两个人推，三个人拉，一个人轮流休息带添谷子，忙得怪有劲的。推到高兴或者疲劳的时候，他们便信口唱起“民主政府爱人民呀，共产党的恩情说不完呀，呀呼嗨嗨一呼呀嗨……”的歌子来了。
    儿童们对工作十分认真，当我提议教他们唱歌的时候，小组长回答我说：“现在学歌子要分心的，等咱们完成了任务再请你教吧！”
    该轮着娄承淑休息了，可是她并没有马上下来，直等到大家都喊：“娄承淑休息吧！”她这才勉强地走下来；但不久她又去找着一个叫娄承照的儿童说：“换换吧！”而娄承照则干胞的回答说：“不换，还没脱袄功夫呢，换啥？”他们常为此而引起争论。
    拉在最前面的一个是娄承宣自己。他一上碾之后，就象是天生成的驼背一样，从来没直过腰。儿童娄承三指着碾旁一件破肩棉袄对我说：“你看，俺组长的袄都拉破了！”其实他身上的单衣的双肩也给擦破了，而且从破口还可以清楚地看到他的两个小肩膀上又都磨起了一层厚厚的“老皮”来了！砂尘，细谷糠，加上汗水，把他的小脸涂得黑黑的，热气大口大口往外吐。他是很累了，可是他却从没想到休息。他号召大家说：“今天我们一定要完成任务不落后！”儿童们都天真而热情的响应道：“不完成任务，晚上不睡觉！”
    儿童们的热情是够令人感动的，刚解放不久的通讯员陈进山同志见了连声说：“怪不得解放军老打胜仗呢，解放区连小孩子都动员起来了呗！”我情不自禁的说：“小弟弟小妹妹们，歇歇吧，你们真是太辛苦啦！”儿童们齐声回答我说：“辛苦啥？大家支援前线打蒋匪，咱们儿童团还能落后吗？”看吧！毛泽东教导下的新儿童是多么自豪，多么骄傲啊！
    下午，我从村干部那里知道了相当惊人的，但又是十分确实的数字，即自莱芜大捷以来，七八天内，儿童团已为前方碾好小米一千二百多斤。几乎担当了该村的全部碾米工作。
