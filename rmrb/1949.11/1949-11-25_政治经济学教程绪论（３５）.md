    Section 3: Marxist-Leninist Political Economy and the Chinese Revolution

    As early as the Anti-Japanese War period, Chairman Mao called on all our cadres to learn how to do economic work, and believed that only by learning this aspect of work "can one be called a complete communist revolutionary." From the following passage, we can fully see the importance of economic work in revolutionary work, and at the same time, we can also see the importance of political economy to revolutionary work. He said:

    "All empty talk is useless, we must give the people visible material benefits. Many of our comrades have not yet turned their minds into the minds of complete communists. They only do one aspect of the work, that is, they only know how to ask the people for this and that, grain, grass, taxes, this and that mobilization work, and do not know how to do the other aspect of the work, that is, to do their best to help the people develop production and promote culture. For the sake of revolution, for the sake of the War of Resistance, it is completely reasonable for us to ask the people for things. It is very good that our comrades have done this aspect of the work, which is what they should do in revolutionary work. But this is only doing one aspect of the work, and it is not even the first aspect of the work. Our first aspect of work is not to ask the people for things, but to give the people things. What can we give the people? In the current conditions of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, it means organizing the people, leading the people, and helping the people develop production, increase their material welfare, and on this basis, step by step, improve their political consciousness and cultural level. For this, we should spare no effort to endure wind and frost, day and night, diligently, earnestly, and practically study the people's living problems, production problems, cattle, farm tools, seeds, fertilizers, water conservancy, pasture, agricultural loans, immigration, reclamation, improved farming methods, women's labor, idler labor, settlement plans, cooperatives, mutual aid teams, transportation teams, the textile industry, animal husbandry, the salt industry, and other important issues, and help the people solve these problems concretely rather than talking empty words. This aspect of work is the first step for every Communist Party member working in the countryside. Only after doing this aspect of work and achieving real results can we gain the support of the people when we do the second aspect of work—the work of asking the people for things… This is the fundamental line and fundamental policy of our party, and every comrade (including comrades in the army) must study it well. Only when our comrades understand and implement these two aspects of work in coordination can we be called a complete communist revolutionary. Otherwise, although we are also doing revolutionary work, although we are also a revolutionary, we are not yet a complete revolutionary..." (Mao Zedong: Economic Problems and Financial Problems)

    The Second Plenary Session of the Party, on the eve of the great victory of the Chinese revolution, which had historical and international significance after twenty-eight years of arduous struggle by the Party, instructed us that the national victory of the revolution was only the first step in the Long March. After the victory of the revolution, the work of revolutionary construction will be a long journey and the work will be even greater. Therefore, it called on our comrades to devote all their efforts to learning economic work, learning production technology and production management methods, and learning commercial work, banking work, and other work closely related to production, and warned our comrades that if we are ignorant in economic construction work and production work, and cannot quickly learn economic construction work, learn production work, and cannot restore and develop production as quickly as possible and achieve real results, we may still fail. From this, it can be seen that learning and mastering economic work, and all scientific and technological business knowledge related to economic work, and thus learning and understanding political economy, are infinitely important to the victorious party and every revolutionary comrade.

    Political Economy and Revolutionary Mass Work

    The so-called mass work is actually the revolutionary work of the revolutionary party mobilizing, organizing, and leading the people to carry out the two major struggles of class struggle and production struggle. Therefore, the need for Marxist-Leninist political economy is no less than the need for political power work. Not to mention that the cause of the revolution is the cause of the working people themselves, and the revolutionary actions of the masses must be the class-conscious actions of the people. Both the daily economic struggles of the oppressed masses and the earth-shattering revolutionary movements in which the masses consciously rise up to overthrow the unreasonable old system are inseparably related to the social and economic system and Marxist-Leninist political economy. Marxist-Leninist political economy is their weapon of understanding and also their weapon of revolutionary struggle. Taking the mass work in the Chinese people's democratic revolution today as an example, in the unliberated areas, how to mobilize, organize, and lead the working class, the peasant class, the petty bourgeoisie, the intellectuals, and the middle bourgeoisie to fight for wage increases, rent resistance, tax resistance, improvement of living conditions, improvement of their social and political status, for the right to democracy and freedom, for opposition to and overthrow of imperialism, bureaucrat-capitalism, and feudal and semi-feudal oppression, and in the liberated cities and regions, how to rely on the working class, mobilize and unite other working people, organize and lead them, to thoroughly eliminate the remnants of the counter-revolutionary forces, eradicate bureaucratic capitalism, feudal and semi-feudal relations of production, establish and build new democratic relations of production, mobilize the labor enthusiasm, labor creativity, and labor initiative and enthusiasm of the working masses, establish correct labor attitudes and labor discipline, launch revolutionary labor competitions, ensure the implementation of the policy of paying attention to all aspects, in order to engage in the restoration and development of the new democratic economy, to restore and develop the productive forces of industry and agriculture, and to achieve the goals of developing production, prospering the economy, and improving the people's lives, it is necessary to have a certain knowledge of political economy.

　　政治经济学教程绪论（３５）
　　王学文
　　政治经济学的研究对象任务及其特点
  　　　　　第三章　政治经济学的任务意义与中国革命
    第三节　马列主义政治经济学与中国革命
    早在抗战时期，毛主席就号召我们各种干部学习做经济工作，并认为只有学会了这方面的工作，“才算得上称为一个完全的共产主义的革命家”，我们从下列一段话中，充分可以看出革命工作中经济工作的重要性，同时也可以看到政治经济学对革命工作的重要性。他说：
    “一切空话都是无用的，必须给人民以看得见的物质福利，我们还有许多同志的头脑没有变成一个完全的共产主义者的头脑，他们只是做了一个方面的工作，即是只知向人民要这样那样的东西，粮呀，草呀，税呀，这样那样的动员工作呀，而不知道做另一方面的工作，即是用尽力量帮助人民发展生产，提倡文化。为了革命，为了抗战，我们向人民要东西是完全合理的，我们同志做了这一方面的工作算是做了他们应的做的革命工作，这是很好的。但这只是做了一个方面工作，而且还不是第一个方面的工作。我们的第一个方面的工作并不是向人民要东西，而是给人民以东西。我们有什么东西可以给人民呢？在目前陕甘宁边区的条件说来，就是组织人民领导人民帮助人民发展生产，增加他们的物质福利，并在这个基础上一步一步地提高他们的政治觉悟与文化程度，为着这个我们应该不惜风霜劳苦，夜以继日，勤勤恳恳，切切实实地去研究人民中间的生活问题，生产问题、耕牛、农具、种籽、肥料、水利、牧草、农贷、移民、开荒、改良农作法、妇女劳动、二流子劳动、安家计划、合作社、变工队、运输队、纺织业、畜牧业、盐业等等重要问题，并帮助人民具体地而不是讲空话地去解决这些问题。这一方面的工作是每个在农村工作的共产党员的第一步工作，只是做了这一方面的工作，并确实生了成效之后，我们去做第二方面的工作——向人民要东西的工作时，我们才能取得人民的拥护，……这就是我们党的根本路线，根本政策，每个同志（军队的同志也在内）都要好好去研究。只有我们的同志懂得并且实行了这样两方面的工作配合时，我们方能算得上称为一个完全的共产主义的革命家。否则我们虽也在做革命工作，虽也是一个革命家，却还不是一个完全的革命家。……”（毛泽东：经济问题与财政问题）
    党的二中全会，在党经过了二十八年的艰苦奋斗获得具有历史意义与国际意义的中国革命伟大胜利的前夕，指示我们革命的全国胜利，只是万里长征走完了第一步。革命胜利以后，革命的建设工作，路程还长，工作更伟大，因此号召我们的同志必须用全力地去学习经济工作，去学习生产的技术和管理生产的方法，去学习和生产有密切联系的商业工作、银行工作及其他工作，并警告我们的同志如果我们在经济建设工作上，在生产工作上无知，不能很快地学会经济建设工作，学会生产工作，不能使生产事业尽可能迅速地恢复和发展，并获得确实的成绩，我们还有可能会失败。由此可见：学习与学会经济工作，和一切有关经济工作的科学技术业务知识，从而学习与通晓政治经济学对于胜利的党和每一个革命同志，都是无限重要的。
    政治经济学与革命的群众工作
    所谓群众工作，实际上就是革命的党发动组织与领导人民大众进行阶级斗争与生产斗争这两大斗争的革命工作。因此，对于马列主义政治经济学的需要，同样地也并不稍逊于政权工作对于它的需要。且不说革命的事业，是劳动人民群众自己的事业，群众的革命行动必须是人民大众阶级自觉的行动。只就被压迫群众日常的经济生活的斗争，和群众自觉地起来推翻不合理的旧制度的翻天覆地的革命运动，都与社会经济制度和马列主义政治经济学有着不可分离的关系，马列主义政治经济学是他们认识的武器，也是他们革命的斗争的武器。就以今天中国人民民主革命中的群众工作来说，在未解放的地区，怎样发动、组织与领导工人阶级、农民阶级、小资产阶级、知识分子以及中等资产阶级等人民大众，为增加工资薪金抗租、抗税，改善生活，改善他们社会的与政治的地位，为争取民主自由的权利，为反对与推翻帝国主义、官僚资本主义与封建半封建的压迫而斗争，在已经解放了的城市与地区里，怎样依靠工人阶级，发动与团结其他劳动人民，组织并领导他们，为彻底肃清反革命的残余势力，铲除官僚资本主义，封建的半封建的生产关系，建立与建设新民主主义的生产关系，发动劳动群众的劳动热忱、劳动创造性与劳动的主动积极性，树立正确的劳动态度与劳动纪律，展开革命的劳动竞赛，保证四面八方政策的执行，以从事新民主主义的经济的恢复与发展工作，以恢复与发展工业与农业的生产力，达到发展生产，繁荣经济，改善人民生活的目的，都必需具有一定的政治经济学的知识的。
