　　Fenyang Special District, Shanxi Province
　　3.5 Million Jin of Cotton Harvested
　　High-Quality Varieties Prepared for Expanded Planting Next Year
    [Our News] The 120,000 mu of cotton fields in the seven counties of the Fenyang Special District in Shanxi Province have been completely harvested, with a total cotton output of over 3.5 million jin. Although the special district suffered from drought, frost, and hail this year, cadres at all levels actively led the broad masses of farmers to fight against the natural disasters and overcome them. The average yield of ginned cotton in the entire special district was over 28 jin per mu. The cotton from Wenshui and Fenyang is famous in Tianjin and Shanghai for its long fibers and good quality. The soil is sandy loam, which is also suitable for cotton planting. Therefore, there are three good varieties of cotton: "Jinzi" cotton, "Guannong No. 1" cotton, and "Tuozi" cotton. However, due to mixed planting for many years, they have largely deteriorated. At the beginning of last month, the provincial government, in order to expand cotton fields and improve varieties next year, sent 16 technical cadres, divided into three groups, focusing on Wenshui and Fenyang counties, to go to the countryside to mobilize cotton farmers to select and transfer seeds. Local county and district leaders also organized cadres to actively participate. This work lasted for more than a month and has been largely completed. Wenshui selected 2 million jin of Jinzi cotton seeds and Guannong No. 1 cotton seeds with less mixed planting; Fenyang also selected 880,000 jin. The entire special district selected a total of 3.2 million jin of better cotton seeds preserved by the masses, enough to plant 320,000 mu of cotton fields. The special district also plans to plant 280,000 mu of cotton next year, more than 1.3 times this year.

　　山西汾阳专区
　　收棉三百五十万斤
　　已准备优良品种明年扩大植棉
    【本报讯】山西省汾阳专区七个县十二万亩棉田已收获完毕，共计产棉三百五十余万斤。该专区今年虽经旱、冻、雹灾，但经各级干部积极领导广大农民与天灾作斗争，战胜了灾害。全专区每亩平均产皮棉二十八市斤以上。文水、汾阳棉花芒长质好，驰名于天津、上海，土质沙壤，亦适宜种棉，故有金字棉、关农一号棉、脱字棉等三种良种，但因混种多年，大体变质。上月初，省府为明年扩大棉田改良品种，派技术干部十六人，分三个组，以文、汾两县为重点，下乡发动棉农进行选种与调种；该地县区领导亦组织干部积极参加。此项工作历时月余，已大体完成。文水选出混种较少的金字棉种、关农一号棉种共达二百万斤；汾阳亦选出八十八万斤。全专区选好由群众保存的较优良棉种共达三百二十万斤，够种棉田三十二万亩。该专区并计划明年种棉二十八万亩，超过今年一点三倍多。
