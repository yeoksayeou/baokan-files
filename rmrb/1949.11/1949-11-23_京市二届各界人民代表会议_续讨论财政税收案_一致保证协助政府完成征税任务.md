　　Second Session of the Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference
　　Continues Discussion of Financial and Tax Proposals
    Unanimously Guaranteeing Assistance to the Government in Completing Tax Collection Tasks
    [Beijing News] The Second Session of the Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference continued its discussion on the financial and tax proposals put forward by the Municipal Government on the 22nd. Representatives from all walks of life spoke enthusiastically, supporting the proposals and guaranteeing that they would launch extensive publicity among the masses after the meeting to assist the government in completing the tax collection tasks. The key points of the representatives' speeches are excerpted below:

    Jin Kuizhi, representative of primary and secondary school teachers and staff, said: "We should first recognize the essential difference between today's taxation and the taxation during the Kuomintang rule. The Kuomintang's taxation was to extract blood and sweat from the people, with some of it going into private pockets and some of it used to suppress the people. Today's taxation is entirely for the purpose of serving the people, and it is completely in line with the interests of the people. After studying the principles and specific methods of taxation, we feel that this is indeed fair and reasonable, and fully in line with the principles of developing production and prospering the economy. Therefore, we wholeheartedly support the government's tax proposals."

    Cao Jianrong, a farmer representative, said: "I represent the farmers in supporting the five financial and tax proposals put forward by the Municipal Government, because the Kuomintang's taxation in the past was unreasonable. Their high officials took the money they collected back to their homes to buy houses and land. The current taxation is entirely for the purpose of building Beijing, and we have personally seen the various expenditures mentioned in Mayor Nie's report. Taking agricultural tax as an example, it also takes into account our harvest yields, reducing or exempting where appropriate, which is very fair and reasonable. After I go back, I will definitely publicize it well, so that the farmers will understand."

    　　　　Government's Financial and Tax Proposals are Scientific, Rational, Democratic and Fair

    Fei Xiaotong, representative of teachers and staff from universities and colleges, said: "As a result of our discussion, we believe that our government is a good government, a government that serves the people. A good government takes money from the people and uses it for the benefit of all the people. The high percentage of operating expenses in the government budget indicates that it provides more welfare for the people. Mayor Nie reported yesterday that operating expenses will account for more than 50 percent next year, which is the best government I have ever seen. In the past, Beijing's expenditures had to be borne in part by the farmers. In the future, we should achieve self-sufficiency, so the burden on the citizens of Beijing cannot be reduced. The government's proposal expresses four spirits: (1) Scientific: because the tax rules and rates are determined after investigation and research. (2) Rational: because the provision that industrial tax is lower than commercial tax is in line with the New Democracy economic policy, as Comrade Peng Zhen said: "To improve the people's lives, we must develop production." (3) Democratic: because the determination of tax revenue relies on democratic assessment and the participation of people's representatives. (4) Fair: because it is progressive."

    Liu Henian, a worker representative, said: "Tax payment is originally the duty of the people. During the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation, the farmers shed blood and sweat, contributing money and effort. Today, to build the city, should the farmers still bear a large burden? We workers have the strength, and we will definitely use 100% of our strength to help the government complete the tax collection work."

    Pu Jiexiu, representative of the industrial and commercial circles, said: "The War of Liberation has not yet ended, and construction requires funds everywhere. The people of the city should now take on their own expenses. We unanimously agree with the government's tax measures and will do our best to complete our tasks."

    Zhang Xianting, a representative of the industrial and commercial circles, said: "The overall business tax drafted by the Municipal Government has been reduced by about half compared with the Kuomintang reactionary rule. The income tax on profit-making enterprises is lighter than the agricultural tax. But some people still have opinions, because during the Kuomintang period, they could pay less tax by having connections and bribing officials, but now they can't get this kind of benefit. Moreover, tax collection is carried out by the tax bureau with in-depth understanding, and also adopts self-declaration, public discussion and democratic evaluation, so it is impossible to offer bribes." He hopes that the government will pay attention to in-depth understanding during the implementation. He expressed satisfaction with the tax proposal on behalf of the industrial and commercial circles, and firmly guaranteed that the tax revenue would be deposited into the treasury as soon as possible.

    Zuo Guangyu, a representative of the industrial and commercial circles, said: "I am a stall vendor representative. In the past, we would have a headache when the Kuomintang collected even one cent from us, because the Kuomintang collected the people's money for their own enjoyment. Now, for the construction of our new Beijing and new market, who wouldn't be happy to pay the stall tax?"

    Zhao Jiwu, a representative of the industrial and commercial circles, said: "I represent the industrial and commercial circles in fully supporting the government's tax proposals. Our entire industrial and commercial circles support it, and we hope that our government will strive for fairness and rationality in the implementation, and that all departments will work hard in their respective positions!"

    Fan Hong, a democratic professor, said: "The government needs to spend money to seek happiness for the people. There are two sources of money. One is to issue banknotes, but the more that is issued, the higher the prices rise, and the greater the burden on the working people. The other is to issue public bonds, but debts must be repaid, and with interest. Collecting fair and reasonable taxes is the best way."

### 京市二届各界人民代表会议　续讨论财政税收案  一致保证协助政府完成征税任务

　　京市二届各界人民代表会议
　　续讨论财政税收案
    一致保证协助政府完成征税任务
    【北京讯】北京市第二届各界人民代表会议二十二日继续讨论市政府提出的财政税收提案时，各界代表热烈发言，拥护该项提案，并保证会后在群众中展开广泛宣传，协助政府，完成征税任务。兹将各代表发言要点摘录如下：
    中小学教职员代表金魁之说：“我们首先应该认识今天的税收和国民党统治时期税收在实质上的不同，国民党时的税收是从人民身上榨取血汗以后，一部分饱入私囊，一部分用来作镇压人民的费用。我们今天的税收，完全是用来为人民服务的。是与人民的利益完全一致的。当我们研究了征税的原则和具体办法，觉得这样做的确是公平合理，完全符合发展生产，繁荣经济的原则。因此，我们衷心拥护政府的税收提案。”
    农民代表曹建荣说：“我代表农民拥护市政府所提出的五项财政税收议案，因为过去国民党的税收是不合理的，他们的大官把所收的钱拿回自己家去买房买地。现在的税收，完全是为了建设北京，而在聂市长报告中说的种种开支，我们都是亲眼看见的。拿农业税说，还照顾了我们的收成产量，该减的减，该免的免，非常公平合理。我回去之后，一定好好宣传，要叫农民都明白。”
    　　　　政府财政税收提案　科学合理民主公平
    院校教职员代表费孝通说：“我们讨论的结果，认为我们的政府是好政府，是为人民服务的政府。好政府是从人民身上拿来钱，用到全体人民身上去。政府预算中事业费所占的百分率高，就表示它为人民办的福利多。聂市长昨天报告说，明年的事业费要占百分之五十以上，这是我从来没见过的好政府。以前北京的支出，一部分要靠农民负担，今后我们应做到自给自足，所以北京市民的负担，还不可能减轻。政府的提案里表示四种精神：（一）科学：因为税则税率的规定都是经过调查研究的。（二）合理：因为工业税低于商业税的规定，是合乎新民主义经济政策的，正如彭真同志所说：“要改善人民生活，只有发展生产”。（三）民主：因为决定税收是依靠民主评定并有人民代表参加。（四）公平：因为是累进制。
    工人代表刘鹤年说：“纳税本来是人民的义务，在抗日战争和解放战争中，农民们流血流汗，出钱出力，今天建设城市，还要叫农民来大量负担吗？我们工人有力量，我们一定用百分之百的力量，帮助政府来完成税收工作。”
    工商业界代表浦洁修说：“目前解放战争还未结束，而建设在在需款。都市人民今天应自己起来担负自己的费用了。我们一致同意政府税收的措施，并尽力来完成我们的任务。”
    工商界代表张献廷说：“市政府所拟订的营业税总的分数，比国民党反动统治时期已减少一半左右。营利事业所得税比农业税还轻。但有些人还有意见，这是因为国民党时期，有门子、送贿赂、就可以少交税，现在检不到这种便宜了。而且征税是由税局深入了解，还采取自报公议与民主评定，所以想行贿赂也不可能了。”他希望政府在执行时，要注意深入了解。他代表工商界对税收案表示满意，并坚决保证税收早早入库。
    工商界代表左广玉说：“我是摊贩代表。从前国民党征我们一分钱，我们都脑袋疼，因为国民党征了老百姓的钱自己享乐，现在为建设我们新北京、新市场，摊点儿税，谁不乐意呢？”
    工商业界代表赵辑五说：“我代表工商业界完全拥护政府的税收提案，我们工商业界全体予以支持，并希望我们政府在执行中力求公平合理，各站岗位，努力工作！”
    民主教授樊弘说：“政府为人民谋幸福，一定需要支出。钱的来源，一种是发钞票，但是越发的多，物价越涨，劳苦大众的负担越大。一种是发公债，但是借帐要还，而且要加利息。征收公平合理的税是最好的办法。”
