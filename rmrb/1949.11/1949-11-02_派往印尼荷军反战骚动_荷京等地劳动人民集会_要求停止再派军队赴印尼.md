　　Demanding an End to Sending More Troops to Indonesia
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 1st] According to a TASS report from The Hague on October 28th: Hundreds of Dutch soldiers scheduled to be sent to Indonesia have rioted because they are unwilling to participate in the colonial war to suppress the Indonesian people. On the 27th, working people in Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, and other towns held rallies, passing resolutions demanding an end to sending more troops to Indonesia. Dutch Communist Party member of parliament, Wijgma, spoke in parliament about the current riots in the Dutch army, emphasizing that soldiers are unwilling to participate in the Dutch and American imperialists' adventure to stifle the Indonesian national liberation movement. Wijgma suggested stopping the dispatch of troops to Indonesia and establishing a committee to investigate the cause of the riots. The reactionary majority in the Dutch parliament rejected this proposal. Minister of the Army, Schokking, said: Soldiers participating in the riots will be sent to Indonesia, regardless of their wishes.
　　According to a report from Aneta news agency: The Setekres ship, carrying a new detachment of Dutch troops, sailed from Rotterdam to Indonesia on October 28th. It is claimed that two groups of soldiers who refused to fight against the Indonesian people were forcibly put on the ship.

　　派往印尼荷军反战骚动
    荷京等地劳动人民集会
  　要求停止再派军队赴印尼
    【新华社北京一日电】据塔斯社海牙十月二十八日讯：有数百名被派往印尼的荷军因不愿参加镇压印尼人民的殖民地战争而发生骚动。二十七日，阿姆斯特丹、鹿特丹、海牙及其他城镇的劳动人民，纷纷举行集会，会上都通过决议，要求停止再把军队开往印尼。荷共议员魏吉纳在议会论及现在荷军中发生的骚动时强调说：士兵们不愿参加企图窒息印尼民族解放运动的荷美帝国主义者的冒险。魏吉纳建议停止派军至印尼，并建立一个调查骚动起因的委员会。荷兰议会的反动多数派否决了这一建议。陆军部长肖金说：参加骚动的士兵，不问其愿否均将派往印尼。
    又据安普通讯社消息：载有荷军新分遣队的赛特克莱斯号轮船，于十月二十八日自鹿特丹开往印尼。据称，两队拒绝与印尼人民作战的士兵是被强制押上该船的。
