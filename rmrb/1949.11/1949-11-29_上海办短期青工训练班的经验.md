Shanghai's Experience in Running Short-Term Youth Worker Training Classes

After the liberation of Shanghai, the Shanghai Municipal Work Committee of the Communist Youth League, in order to cultivate backbone cadres for building the League in factories, organized a youth worker training class that lasted for one week. The trainees included young workers and staff from factories and units such as cotton mills, machinery factories, power plants, waterworks, banks, shops, printing houses, and coolie transportation. To focus on cultivating cadres, two-thirds of the trainees were drawn from the eastern and western districts of Shanghai, where most of the factories are located. Most of the trainees had a primary or secondary school education, with some being illiterate. They had a considerable degree of political awareness and knew that the Communist Party was good, but some workers had not heard of the New Democratic Youth League.

The comrades in charge of the training class knew from the start that it would be impossible to solve all the problems in the minds of the young workers in just one week. Therefore, they focused on resolving a few basic issues. These basic issues were: First, the current situation and tasks; Second, what is the New Democratic Youth League? Third, how to establish the Youth League in factories? Fourth, youth and internationalism. These issues were discussed repeatedly, hoping that the participating workers would focus on understanding the status and tasks of the working class today, why we are not afraid of the enemy's blockade, how to strive to complete the six major tasks of the East China region, as well as what is the Youth League? Why establish the Youth League? The relationship between the League and all parties, and what are the differences between the United States and the Soviet Union?

Because workers had few opportunities to study during the Kuomintang rule, when the young workers came to the training class, many factories sent them off with gongs and drums, and firecrackers, hoping that after studying, they would return to the factories and do a good job in the work of the trade union and the Youth League. The young people worked hard in their studies. Some could not take notes and were worried that they would not remember, so after listening to the lectures, they borrowed other people's notes to copy, or discussed them in groups of two or three.

Three trainees from the eighth group of the fifth team said: "Others have notes, but we have a low level of education and cannot take them down. We can only discuss and deliberate more on how to work when we go back."

After listening to the report on the current situation and tasks, everyone realized that the current difficulties in Shanghai are difficulties in the course of victory and advancement, and that although the enemy is blockading us, under the leadership of the Communist Party, there are ways to overcome the difficulties completely. They also realized the importance of production and conservation in factories and reducing costs. One trainee came with 20,000 yuan RMB, intending to buy good food, but after learning about the anti-blockade issue, he decided to save the money. A worker self-critically said: "I was still lazy and not working hard in production after liberation. I will make a self-criticism to everyone when I go back." Many young workers and staff criticized themselves for looking down on the old workers in the past, and not being good at uniting all the workers to work hard in production together, and were determined to correct this quickly when they went back.

Before studying the issue of the Youth League, some young workers and staff had many problems in their minds, such as what benefits does the Youth League have for me? Why is there a Youth League when there is a Communist Party? Why is there a Youth League when there is a trade union? Can you join the League if you smoke cigarettes? These problems were all resolved during the study. After the resolution, they asked to join the League one after another, and bought League documents and League publications such as "China Youth" to study carefully when they returned to the factory.

After studying international issues, everyone knew what the difference was between the trade agreement signed between the Soviet Union and the Northeast and the Sino-US Commercial Treaty signed between the Kuomintang and the United States. They also knew what the difference was between the Soviet Union and the United States, and had a preliminary understanding of internationalism, new patriotism, cosmopolitanism, and narrow nationalism.

Some workers used to think that the Communist Party and the Kuomintang were fighting for power and profit, and that serving the people was just empty talk. After studying, they understood that the Communist Party and the Kuomintang were different in essence. Because the comrades in charge of the training class lived in close contact with everyone and were not at all arrogant, many workers were reminded of the Kuomintang's oppression of workers in the past, and deeply realized that the Communist Party was truly the party of the working class, like their own relatives.

In this study, the trainees improved a step in their political thought and their views on many issues.

This training class only focused on a few issues, so it was able to solve problems. Unlike some short-term training classes in the past, which talked about many things that the learners could not accept, this can be considered a successful experience. The shortcomings of this training were: The entire study plan was not fully discussed among the instructors, and the ideological level of the trainees was not understood in advance from various factories. Therefore, it was not possible to guide the study well according to the ideological level of the trainees, and the exchange of experience between the groups was not sufficient. Secondly, because the leadership did not mimeograph all the handouts and distribute them to everyone in advance, many young workers who could not take notes regarded copying notes as a burden. It is hoped that these points will be avoided when other places run short-term training classes.

### 上海办短期青工训练班的经验

　　上海办短期青工训练班的经验
    上海解放后，青年团上海市工作委员会，为了培养工厂建团的骨干，举办了一次青工训练班，训练做工厂中青年团工作的干部。时间只有一个星期。参加学习的学员包括纱厂、机器厂、发电厂、自来水厂、银行、商店、印刷、苦力运输等工厂单位的青年工人和职员。为了有重点的培养干部，学员中三分之二都是从上海市工厂最多的东西两区抽调来的。学员中大多数是中小学程度，也有一些不识字的，有相当的政治觉悟，都知道共产党好，但是对于新民主主义青年团，有些工人还没有听说过。
    训练班的负责同志，一开始就知道在短短的一个星期内，不可能解决青年工友们的思想中所存在的各种问题，所以只着重解决几个基本的问题，这些基本问题就是：第一、目前形势与任务；第二、什么是新民主主义青年团？第三、如何在工厂中建立青年团？第四、青年与国际主义。把这几个问题，翻来复去讨论。希望参加学习的工人着重地了解工人阶级今天的地位与任务、为什么不怕敌人封锁、如何为完成华东区六大任务而努力，以及什么是青年团？为什么建立青年团？团与各方面的关系，美国和苏联有什么不同等问题。
    因为在国民党统治时代，工人们很少有学习的机会，所以当青年工人们来训练班学习的时候，很多工厂都打着锣鼓，放鞭炮，给他们送行，希望他们学习以后回到工厂，把工会和青年团的工作作好。青年们在学习中都很努力。有的不会记笔记，耽心记不牢，回到工厂后没有东西给大家讲，于是在听讲后借别人的笔记抄，或是两三人在一起讨论。
    第五队第八组有三个学员说：“人家有笔记，我们文化水平低，记不下来，只好多商量多讨论，回去怎样工作。”
    在听了目前形势与任务的报告之后，大家都认识到目前上海所存在的困难是胜利前进中的困难，敌人虽然封锁我们，但是在共产党的领导下，是完全有办法克服困难的。也认识到在工厂中生产节约，减低成本的重要。有一个学员，来的时候带着二万元人民币，准备买好东西吃，学习了反封锁问题，他就决定把钱节省下来。一个工人自我批评说：“我在解放后还是偷懒，不努力生产，这次回去要向大家检讨。”不少青年职工检讨出自己过去看不起老工人，不善于团结所有工人一起努力生产，下定决心，回去后要很快的改正。
    在学习青年团的问题以前，有些青年职工在思想中存在着许多问题，例如青年团对自己有什么好处？有了共产党为什么还要青年团？有工会为什么还要青年团？抽香烟可不可以入团？这些问题都在学习中得到了解决，解决以后，他们纷纷要求入团，并且买了团的文件和“中国青年”等团刊准备回工厂去好好学习。
    学习国际问题以后，大家知道了苏联和东北订立贸易协定跟国民党和美国订的中美商约有什么不同。也知道了苏联和美国有什么不同，对于国际主义，新爱国主义，世界主义和狭隘的民族主义等也都有了初步的认识。
    有的工友过去认为共产党和国民党争权夺利，什么为人民服务等等都是空话。学习以后，他们明白了共产党和国民党在本质上就不同。由于训练班的负责同志和大家生活打成一片，没有一点架子，很多工人联想到过去国民党压迫工人的情形，深深体会到共产党真正是工人阶级的政党，象自己的亲人一样。
    在这次学习中，学员们无论在政治思想上，以及对许多问题的看法上都提高了一步。
    这次训练班只抓紧几个问题来讲，因此很能解决问题，不象过去有些短期训练班讲了很多东西，学的人接受不了，这算是一点成功的经验。这次的缺点是：整个学习计划没有在辅导员中充分讨论，对学员的思想水平，事先也没有从各厂进行了解，因此，没有能很好地根据学员的思想水平领导学习，各组交流经验也不够。其次，因为领导上事先没有把讲义都油印出来发给大家，以致使很多不能作笔记的青年职工，把抄笔记当成一种负担。这些地方，希望别处办短期训练班的时候注意避免。
