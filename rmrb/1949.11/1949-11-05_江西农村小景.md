　　Jiangxi Countryside Scene
　　Special Correspondent of this Newspaper Zhan Chao
　　On the undulating, stony roads, people carrying loads come and go from time to time. Most of them are women wearing coarse, earth-blue cloth, barefoot and with exposed legs, carrying loads weighing eighty or ninety pounds, walking briskly, not falling behind the men at all. In the distance is a village, lined with paulownia and fir trees. The houses are mostly in the style of ancestral halls, with slogans left on the faded walls, painted over and over again countless times. Beside the village is a sewage pond, where water buffalo are soaking and bathing. At this moment, a scabby-headed child suddenly shouts, but the water buffalo remain unmoved, scaring a flock of ducklings in a small pond nearby, who run quacking onto the path. There is a green snake that has been crushed to death, and ants are crawling on its body. Beyond the path is the rolling Gan River, with rows of fir trees floating downstream, passing through Poyang Lake and entering the Yangtze River to be sold in Nanjing, Changzhou, and other areas.
　　This is the Jiangxi countryside.
　　At first, we entered eastern Jiangxi along the railway line, but because the train was moving quickly, we didn't see much. Later, following the army on foot into western and southern Jiangxi, areas that had just been liberated, a picture of disaster after the ravaging of the countryside was presented before our eyes: Looking at a complete house from afar, upon closer inspection, the gate is wide open, and the house is full of lush weeds; fields are desolate in patches, and villages are sparsely populated; malnourished women are performing excessive labor. This scene is especially obvious when you walk away from the main roads. This is all the result of the Kuomintang bandit gang's implementation of "benevolent governance." During its one or two decades of rule in Jiangxi, the province's population decreased from more than 21 million to 13 million. This drastic decrease in population was caused by the following reasons: (1) The Kuomintang bandit gang, in order to suppress the Jiangxi people's struggle for freedom and survival, did not hesitate to adopt a policy of bloodshed: in Shangbao Village, a small village in eastern Yudu County, on August 4th, 1925 alone, fifty-three young people were killed by the reactionaries. Such examples are far too many in the Jiangxi countryside. Ruijin County, the old revolutionary base area, originally had 330,000 people, but now only 180,000 are left, many of whom were directly bayoneted, hacked, or buried alive by the Kuomintang bandit gang. From 1935 to 1937, the bandit gang carried out three major massacres in Ruijin, with at least 5,000 victims. (2) The endless conscription of soldiers, grain, and taxes by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang brought immeasurable disasters to the people of Jiangxi. In order to strangle the people's resistance and facilitate its endless exploitation, the bandit gang even implemented the so-called "merging villages policy," forcing people in more remote areas to move to both sides of transportation lines, merging small villages into large villages, and then using "joint guarantee" and "joint liability" to force the people to submit and be slaughtered. A large number of young men were taken away, and the elderly, weak, women, and children left in the villages had to use intense labor to support the Chiang bandit army's numerous "military expenses," and also had to pay "gun fees" to the "National Army" with a large amount of grain, otherwise they would be charged with "colluding with bandits," forcing people to sell their sons and daughters and starve to death in other places. (3) Chiang bandit's oppressive policies forced the people of the vast rural areas of Jiangxi into a state of semi-starvation. Extreme malnutrition led to death in the hundreds once diseases occurred. This is a blood debt! A blood debt written by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang! The people of Jiangxi will never, ever forget it.
　　When I was walking in the Jiangxi countryside, I often saw scenes like this: the People's Liberation Army marched south from Anfu County in western Jiangxi along the highway from Ji'an to Ganzhou, with both cars and artillery, attracting many villagers to put down their hoes and carrying poles to watch.
　　"At this rate, the White Army (referring to the Chiang bandit army) will never come back!" When I was resting in Luotian Township, sixty miles south of Suichuan County, an old man named Lin Qingyun said to me, he came to this conclusion after careful observation. We were standing on a wooden bridge at that time; a lot of people were crowded on the other side of the bridge, excitedly counting the livestock and artillery passing by. More than twenty days ago, Chiang bandit's 23rd Army was still stationed in his village, grabbing recruits and plundering, scaring the people into hiding in the mountains. As soon as the People's Liberation Army arrived on the sixteenth day of the first lunar July, those white bandits took off and ran, and it was said that they were killed by many of the people in Nanxiong, Guangdong. At the beginning, only a few Liberation Army soldiers came to Luotian Village, escorting prisoners, and they treated the people very well. First, the old men came back, then some strong men in their thirties and forties came back, and then young people, women, and children all came back, and the village immediately regained its vitality. Now, excitedly seeing that the people have such a powerful armed force marching forward, they threw away the seemingly obedient and seemingly indifferent attitude of coping with the old rulers, and talked and laughed freely. Later, they gathered around to look at the portrait of Chairman Mao I was carrying, and exclaimed naively: "What a blessing!" A strong peasant named Liu Guantian was late and asked me to take out the booklet with the picture of Chairman Mao pasted on it again for him to see, and said excitedly that he had seen Chairman Mao when he was young, "He was so thin before!" At that time, the Red Army was still small and passed through the east side of their village, "It's good now!"
　　On the day from Wan'an Lutian Street to Suichuan City, I met an old Red guerrilla member from the Soviet area, Ma Congbai. He was from Shangbao Village, Yudu County. When the Red Army went on the Long March, he stayed in the local area. The Kuomintang reactionaries killed six members of his family, his brother ran away, his old mother starved to death, his wife was seized by the reactionaries, and he was arrested and imprisoned in Jiujiang. Later, he escaped alone to Majiazhou wasteland in Taihe County, west of Jiangxi, planning to go back to Yudu to participate in work after the autumn harvest this year. For more than ten years, he has not forgotten the revolution, because Chairman Mao and Comrade Zhang Wentian wrote articles in the Soviet area saying: We must win! These words gave him courage and strength. In the early days of the Anti-Japanese War, the Red guerrillas in Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Guangdong were reorganized into the New Fourth Army. He accepted the Party's task to do organizational work. Later, the troops withdrew to the north, and he was left in Jiangnan until now. People like this can be seen everywhere in the Jiangxi countryside. Old Red guerrilla member Ma Congbai told me that before and after the liberation, many old comrades in Majiazhou started working, cooperating with the People's Liberation Army to collect the guns of the reactionary armed forces, and 293 guns have now been collected. In the places we passed, in some villages in Taihe County with a working foundation, slogans from the Red Army era were still left on the walls: "Oppose Imperialism Dividing China!" "Treat the White Bandit Army Prisoners Well!" "Expand the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army!" This is the banner of struggle, and it will forever, forever record the heroic history of the people in the old revolutionary base areas.
　　Jiangxi was originally a rich province. In the past, in addition to exporting a large amount of rice, the tea production was very large. More than fifty counties in the province produced tea, with a planting area of over one million mu, with an annual output of four to five hundred thousand dan. Before and after World War I, Jiangxi tea was very active in the international market. In 1914, it created the highest national record of exporting more than 335,000 dan. The timber production was also very large, especially in the Gan River basin. According to the statistics of the puppet Ministry of Finance in 1929, the annual timber production of the province was 350,000 liang, totaling 16 million logs. Most of these timbers were sold in Nanjing, Changzhou, and other areas. It is estimated that before the Anti-Japanese War, "Western timber" was sold abroad for 100,000 liang every year. As for tungsten ore, it is world-famous. This mineral sand, which is indispensable for national defense industries, is centered on Xihuashan in Dayu and distributed in seventeen counties in southern Jiangxi. Some say the reserves are more than 1.6 million metric tons (Ding Yixing et al. in the Quarterly Journal of the Puppet Resources Committee, Volume 1, Issue 2), and some say they are more than 3.99 million metric tons (Zhou Daolong, "Records of Tungsten Mines in Southern Jiangxi"). Although the figures vary, it is certain that the reserves are very large.
　　Unfortunately, under the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, our great country, rich fields, and mineral resources were all devastated by the bandits' beastly plunder and destruction. By 1947, Jiangxi tea exports were only twenty to thirty thousand dan. The famous "Western timber" used to be very active in the markets of Nanjing and Changzhou. In recent years, under the traitorous contracts of the Chiang bandit, it has been unable to resist the "foreign timber" from the United States and Canada transported from across the Atlantic Ocean. Tungsten sand has always been used by the Chiang bandit gang as collateral for loans, and a large amount of it has been transported to American imperialists and others to manufacture guns and cannons to kill the Chinese people.
　　Today, Jiangxi is the people's Jiangxi. The people of Jiangxi, especially the broad masses of rural people, will thoroughly eliminate the remaining counter-revolutionaries, political bandits, and feudal bullies in Jiangxi, and build a prosperous and happy new Jiangxi on the ruins left by the Kuomintang bandit gang.

　　江西农村小景
    本报特约记者  展潮
    在丘陵起伏多石的大路上，不时来往着挑担子的人，其中大部是穿着土蓝色粗布的妇女，赤足露腿，挑着八、九十斤重的担子，健步行走，一点也不落在男人后面。远处是一个村庄，桐杉成行，房屋多作祠堂式，在褪色的墙上，留下不知经过多少次涂来抹去的标语口号。村边是个污水池塘，水牛泡在那里面洗澡，这时一个癞痢头小孩猛然吼叫一声，水牛不为所动，却把旁边小池塘里的一群小鸭吓得不轻，呷呷地跑上田径来。那里是一条被砸死的青蛇，蚂蚁在它身上爬行。田径那边是滚滚的赣江，一排排杉木正顺流而下，北经鄱阳湖而入扬子江，行销南京、常州一带。
    这便是江西的农村。
    起初，我们沿铁路线进入赣东，因为车行匆匆，没有看到更多的东西。后来，随军从步行进于赣西、赣南刚解放的地方，一幅农村被蹂躏后的灾难图，便呈现在眼前了：远望一座完好的房屋，走到跟前一看，大门洞开着，屋子里长满离离的青草；田园成片成片地荒芜着，村庄里人烟稀少；缺乏营养的妇女，操作着过度的劳动。这种景象，离开公路线走时，尤为明显。这都是国民党匪帮施行“德政”的结果，在它统治江西的一、二十年间，全省人口由原来的二千一百多万减少到一千三百万。这种人口急剧的减少，是由于以下几种原因造成的：（一）国民党匪帮为镇压江西人民争自由争生存的斗争，曾不惜采取血洗政策：仅雩都县东部一个小村——上保村，一九二五年八月初四那一天，就被反动派杀死了五十三个青年人。这样的例子，在江西农村里，实在是太多太多了。革命故乡瑞金县原有三十三万人，现在只剩下十八万人了，其中许多是被国民党匪帮直接用枪挑、刀砍、活埋的。一九三五年到一九三七年，匪帮在瑞金进行过三次大屠杀，被难者至少在五千人以上。（二）蒋介石匪帮无止境的征兵、征粮、征税，带给江西人民的灾害，也是难以数计的。为了扼杀人民的反抗，便于它无止境的榨取，匪帮更实施所谓“并村政策”，把在较偏僻地方的人民，赶到交通线两旁，把小村并入大村，然后用“连环保”、“连坐法”，逼使人民就范，任其宰割屠杀，大量的壮丁被拉走了，留在村里的老弱妇孺，得用强度的劳动，来支持蒋匪军名目繁多的“军费”，还要用大量谷子去向“国军”缴纳“枪费”，不然就以“通匪”论罪，逼得人民卖儿鬻女，饿死他乡。（三）蒋匪苛政，逼使江西广大农村的人民，陷入半饥饿壮态中，极度的营养不良，一旦有了疾病，便成十成百地死亡。这是血债啊！蒋介石匪帮一手写下的血债！江西人民，永生永世都不会忘却的。
    我在江西农村行走的时候，常看到这样的情景：解放大军从赣西的安福县，沿着吉安到赣州的公路南进，一路上又是汽车，又是大炮，逗引着许多老乡放下锄头、担子来看。
    “这个样子，白军（指蒋匪军）再不会回来＠！”我在遂川县城南六十里的罗田乡歇脚的时候，一个叫林庆云的老头对我这么说，他是经过审慎底观察后才得出这样的结论。我们那时正站在一条木桥上；桥的那头挤着好多人，在兴致勃勃地数算着过路的牲口和大炮。二十多天以前，蒋匪二十三军还在他村里驻扎，抓丁抢掠，把老百姓都吓得藏到山里去，阴历第一个七月十六解放军一到，那些白匪们拔起腿就跑，听说到了广东的南雄，被那里的老百姓干掉了不少。开头到罗田村来，只有几个解放军，是押俘虏的，待老百姓真好。起先是老头子回来，接着是些三四十岁的壮年人回来，随后年青人、女人和小孩都回来了，村子马上恢复了生气。现在，兴奋地看见人民自己有这样强大的武装，向前进军，便把那副应付旧日统治者似乎是顺从，又似乎是冷淡的态度全都抛掉，自由自在地说笑着。后来，他们围着看我带的毛主席像，天真地叫起来：“真是好福气咯！”一个叫刘观田的壮年农民来晚了，要我把贴毛主席像的本子重新掏出来给他看，兴奋地说，他年轻时见过毛主席，“以前好瘦咯！”那时，红军还小，从他们村东边通过，“这阵子好”＠！
    从万安潞田街到遂川城那天，在路上我遇到一个苏区时代的老红色游击队员马从柏，他是雩都县上保村人，红军长征时，他留在地方上，国民党反动派把他全家子十口人杀了六口，哥哥出走了，老母饿死了，老婆被反动派霸占了，自己被抓到九江坐班房，后来他一个人逃到赣江西边的泰和县马家洲开荒地，打算今年收罢秋回雩都去参加工作。十多年来，他没有忘记过革命，因为毛主席和张闻天同志在苏区时代，曾写过文章说：我们一定要胜利！这话给予他以勇气和力量。抗战初期，闽、浙、赣、粤一带的红色游击队改为新四军，他接受党的任务做组织工作，后来部队北撤，他被留在江南直到现在。象这样的人，在江西农村里，随处都可以看见。老红色游击队员马从柏告诉我，解放前后，马家洲好多老同志就干开了，配合解放军，收缴反动武装的枪支，现在已经缴到二百九十三枝了。在我们走过的地方，在泰和县一些有工作基础的村子，墙壁上还留着红军时代的标语：“反对帝＠（国）主＠（义）爪分中＠（国）！”“优待白匪军俘虏！”“扩大工农红军！”这是斗争的标帜，它将永远地、永远地记载着革命故乡人民英雄底史迹。
    江西，本来是个富饶的省份，过去除了大量谷米出口外，茶叶的产量极大，全省有五十多个县份产茶，种茶的面积上百万亩，年产四、五十万担，第一次世界大战前后，赣茶在国际市场上很活跃，一九一四年曾创外销三十三万五千多担的全国最高纪录，木材的产量也很大，尤其赣江流域，据伪财政部一九二九年调查统计：全省年产木材三十五万两共一千六百万根，这些木材大部行销南京、常州一带。据估计：在抗战前“西木”每年外销达十万两。至于钨矿，更是举世闻名的了，这种国防工业不可缺少的矿砂，以大庾西华山为中心，分布赣南十七县，储藏量有的说一百六十余万公吨（伪资源委员会季刊一卷二期丁毅兴等人文），有的说三百九十九万余公吨（周道隆著“赣南钨矿志”），说法虽不一，然而藏量非常巨大，则是确定了的。
    可惜的是，在蒋介石匪帮统治之下，我们大好的江山，富饶的田园和矿产，全被匪徒们兽性的掠夺与摧残弄得残破不堪。赣茶出口，到一九四七年，不过二、三万担。有名的“西木”，以前在南京、常州市场上是很活跃的，这几年来，在蒋匪卖国契约下，已经抵抗不过远自大西洋那边运来的、美国和加拿大底“洋木”了。钨砂则一向被蒋匪帮拿来作借款的抵押品，大量输送到美国帝国主义者等手里，制造枪炮，拿回来残杀中国人民。
    今天，江西已是人民的江西了。江西人民，特别是广大的农村人民，将要把残存在江西的反革命分子、政治土匪与封建恶霸势力彻底肃清，在国民党匪帮留下的破烂摊子上，建设起一个繁荣幸福的新江西。
