　　Second Session of the Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference Resolution
  　Farmers in the Suburban Areas Actively Support
    Decision to Experiment with Agricultural Tax Implementation
    [Our Newspaper] All farmers in the suburban areas of Beijing unanimously expressed their support for the resolutions of the Second Session of the Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference. They were particularly satisfied with the proposal to levy agricultural taxes. Because this proposal is very reasonable, it not only calculates the burden based on this year's actual output, but also decides to reduce or exempt four million jin of millet based on the disaster situation in the suburbs of Beijing. They said: The government's care for the people is truly meticulous!
    In order to implement the agricultural tax policy decided by the conference, all districts in the suburbs of Beijing have held training classes for village cadres to learn about agricultural tax collection methods. Each district has also stipulated that five or six administrative villages should conduct pilot collection first. In the pilot collection, the first step is to examine whether the progressive burden method of the agricultural tax is fair and reasonable, and whether there are any excessively light or heavy phenomena. The second step is to test whether the tax collection method can achieve the goal of rewarding production. The main cadres of each village will also participate in the tax collection work in the pilot villages, and the experience gained will be used as the basis for comprehensively carrying out tax collection work. The burden determined this time is entirely based on population, land, output, and the severity of the disaster. Without affecting the principles of land reform, all districts have successively launched this work. The training class in the Fourteenth District (more than 180 people) ended on the 26th, and the pilot village work began on the 28th; the village cadre training classes in the Thirteenth, Seventeenth, and Nineteenth Districts also started one after another. All districts first conveyed the "Draft of the Provisional Measures for Agricultural Progressive Tax" and launched discussions.

　　京二届代表会决议案
  　市郊区农民积极拥护
    试验执行农业税决定
    【本报讯】京市郊区全体农民，对京市二届各界代表会议的各项决议一致表示拥护。他们对征收农业税的议案尤为满意。因为这个议案非常合理，不仅根据今年实际产量计算负担量，并且根据京郊灾情，决定减免四百万斤小米负担，他们说：政府对于人民的照顾，真是无微不至！
    京郊各区为了执行大会决定的农业税收政策，都举办了村干训练班，学习农业税收办法，各区并规定以五六个行政村先行试验征收。在试验征收中，首先考查农业税的累进负担办法是否公平合理，有无畸轻畸重的现象。其次试验这次征税的办法是否能达到奖励生产的目的。试验村的征收工作中并吸收各村主要干部参加，吸取经验后，做为全面开展征税工作的基础。此次决定的负担量，完全根据人口、土地、产量及灾情轻重等决定。各区在不影响土改工作原则下，先后展开了这一工作，十四区训练班（一百八十余人）于二十六日已结束，二十八日开始进行试验村工作；十三、十七、十九等区的村干部训练班亦先后开始。各区都首先传达了“农业累进税暂行办法草案”。并展开讨论。
