Xinhua News Agency, Southwest Front, 22nd: General Liu Bocheng, Commander of the Second Field Army of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and Political Commissar Deng Xiaoping, issued a solemn warning on November 21st to the Kuomintang military and government personnel in the four provinces of Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, and Xikang, stating: After suffering successive annihilating blows from our People's Liberation Army in East China, Central China, South China, and Northwest China, the remaining forces of the Kuomintang are now approaching their final demise. Guiyang has already been occupied by our army, and the Kuomintang's so-called final strategic system has been cut off at the waist by us. With the liberation of Youyang, Xiushan, Qianjiang, and Pengshui, the southeastern gateway to Sichuan has also been flung open. Chongqing, Chengdu, Kangding, Kunming, and other places will also be liberated in the near future. The plans of the remnant bandit gangs of Chiang, Li, Bai, and Yan to gather their remaining forces and retreat to the borders of Kang, Yunnan, and Guangxi are practically impossible, and their retreat routes will soon be completely cut off by our army. The so-called "American aid" and "counter-offensive" advocated by the bandit chieftains Chiang, Li, Bai, and Yan, and the so-called "Third World War is about to break out, and everything depends on the Third World War," are all dreams of these bandit chieftains. Their purpose is purely to speak for imperialism, in order to deceive the subordinates who are still at their disposal, and make them enter the tomb together with the bandit chieftains. You should understand this situation and quickly choose the path you should take. This army is ordered to march into the Southwest this time, bearing the mission of resolutely overthrowing the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang in the Southwest and liberating the 70 million people of the Southwest. However, towards the Kuomintang military and government personnel in the Southwest, we adhere to the principles of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the Eight Points of Attention promulgated by Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, giving them opportunities to repent and atone for their crimes, and we would like to offer the following four points of advice:

	1. The Kuomintang army should immediately cease resistance, stop sabotage, and await reorganization. All those who cease resistance and await reorganization, whether they belong to the Central faction or the local faction, will be treated equally, assigned to a designated location, and temporarily maintain their original status. Afterwards, they will be reorganized in accordance with the People's Liberation Army's methods, and all officers and soldiers will be employed according to their ranks. Those who are willing to lay down their weapons will be employed or given severance pay to return to their hometowns based on the principle of voluntarism. Those who quickly abandon the counter-revolutionary camp and cooperate with the People's Liberation Army in combat will be rewarded according to their merits. If you are willing to do so, you can send representatives to contact the nearby People's Liberation Army at any time.

	2. Personnel in the Kuomintang government agencies, political, economic, cultural, and educational fields should immediately protect the property, equipment, and archives of the original agencies and schools, and await takeover. Whether they are senior, middle-level, or junior staff, our army will adhere to a lenient policy and employ or properly arrange them according to their respective situations. Those who have contributed to the takeover will be given appropriate rewards, and those who sabotage will be punished.

	3. Kuomintang secret agents should immediately correct their past mistakes and stop doing evil. All those who are willing to repent and start anew and no longer do evil can be forgiven for their past misdeeds and treated leniently. Those who have committed many evils in the past but are willing to repent will also be given the opportunity to atone for their crimes by performing meritorious service. Those who are incorrigible and continue to do evil will eventually find it difficult to escape the people's net of justice.

	4. Township and Bao personnel should immediately maintain local order under the instructions of the Liberation Army and perform errands for the People's Liberation Army. Those who have contributed will be rewarded, and those who have committed crimes will be punished.

	Kuomintang military and government personnel in the Southwest, it is the unanimous desire of the people of the whole country to enter peaceful construction as soon as possible and restore the wounds of many years of war. You should no longer offer meaningless resistance, merely adding to your own sins. If you can wake up immediately and turn to the light, it is not too late, and you still have the opportunity to repent to the people. If you delay any longer, you will never be forgiven by the people, and you will inevitably suffer the consequences you deserve. Continuing to be reactionary versus turning back immediately, darkness versus light, death versus life, two paths are placed before you, allowing no hesitation, and we hope you will make a decision as soon as possible.

　　第二野战军刘伯承邓小平两将军
    忠告西南伪军政人员迅速脱离反革命阵营
    【新华社西南前线二十二日电】中国人民解放军第二野战军司令员刘伯承、政治委员邓小平顷于十一月二十一日向四川、贵州、云南、西康四省国民党军政人员提出忠告称：国民党残余力量经我人民解放军在华东、华中、华南、西北各地给予接连不断的歼灭打击后，现已接近最后复灭之期。贵阳已经为我军占领，国民党的所谓最后战略体系，又已被我拦腰打断。酉、秀、黔、彭既告解放，则四川东南门户亦已洞开，重庆、成都、康定、昆明等地短期内亦将获解放。蒋、李、白、阎等残余匪帮企图收拾残余力量，退集康、滇、桂边之计划已为实际所不允许，其退路即将全部为我军截断。蒋、李、白、阎等匪首倡言所谓“美援”和“反攻”，所谓“第三次大战即将到来，一切有待于第三次世界大战”，均为诸匪首之梦想，其目的纯系为帝国主义张目，为了欺骗尚在供其驱使之部属，使其与该匪首等一同进入坟墓。你们应该明了这种形势，迅速选择自己应走的道路。本军此次奉命进军西南，负有坚决推翻国民党在西南的反动统治及解放西南七千万人民之使命，但对西南国民党军政人员一本人民政协共同纲领及毛主席、朱总司令约法八章之旨，给以改过自新、立功赎罪机会，并愿以下列四事相忠告：
    一、国民党军队应即停止抵抗，停止破坏，听候改编。凡停止抵抗、听候改编者，无论其属于中央系或地方系，均一视同仁，指定驻地，暂维原状，尔后即依照人民解放军的方式实行改编，所有官兵按级录用。凡愿意放下武器者，一本自愿原则，或分别录用，或资遣回籍。凡迅速脱离反革命阵营并协同人民解放军作战者，当论功行赏。如果你们愿意这样做，你们随时可以派代表到附近的人民解放军接洽。
    二、国民党政府机关政治、经济、文化、教育工作等人员，应即保护原有机关学校财产、用具、档案、听候接收，无论其属高级、中级或下级职员，本军均一本宽大政策，分别录用或适当安置，其在接收中有功者，并给予适当奖励，破坏者受罚。
    三、国民党特务人员，应即痛改前非，停止作恶。凡愿改过自新，不再作恶者，均可不咎既往，从宽处理。其过去作恶虽多，但愿改悔者，亦给以立功自赎之机会。其执迷不悟，继续作恶者，终将难逃人民之法网。
    四、乡保人员，应即在解放军指示下，维持地方秩序，为人民解放军办差事。有功者奖，有罪者罚。
    西南国民党军政人员们，早日进入和平建设，恢复多年战争创伤，这是全国人民一致的热望。你们不应再作无谓的抵抗，徒然增加自己的罪孽。如能立即觉悟，投向光明，为时还不算晚，还有向人民悔过的机会。若再延误，将永远不能为人民所谅解，其应得后果，必身受之。继续反动与立即回头，黑暗与光明，死与生，两条道路摆在你们面前，不容徘徊，望早抉择。
