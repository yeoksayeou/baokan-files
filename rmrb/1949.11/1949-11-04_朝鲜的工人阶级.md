　　The Working Class of Korea
    The Democratic People's Republic of Korea, located in the northeast of our country, is closely connected to the Liaodong Province of our country, separated only by the Yalu River. It has a population of over 22 million and an area slightly larger than Hunan Province in our country. From 1910 to August 1945, Japanese imperialism ruled Korea for 36 years, exhausting all means to monopolize and exploit the economy, implementing fascist rule in politics, and using various methods to eliminate Korean culture. At that time, Korean schools were not allowed to use Korean textbooks, and even speaking a Korean word was considered a crime. Under Japanese fascist rule, the lives of workers were even more miserable. They had to work for more than twelve hours a day, and light industrial workers even had to work for sixteen hours. Female or child laborers doing the same work only received half the wages of ordinary male workers. Most workers were underfed and poorly clothed, living in sunless shacks. Due to the harsh living conditions, more than 30% of the workers suffered from lung diseases. If workers showed slight dissatisfaction, factories would dismiss them without reason or imprison them. To resist this inhuman oppression, Korean workers launched six major strikes in 1912 alone. In 1920, under the leadership of the Korean Communist Party, Korean workers secretly organized trade unions. In 1925, the National Federation of Trade Unions was established, and Korean workers began to have a unified leadership organization. To improve their lives and for national liberation, they launched a tenacious struggle against the enemy. From December 1928 to March 1929, transport workers carried out a large-scale general strike for three months.
    In August 1945, the Soviet Red Army defeated Japanese imperialism, and Korea was liberated from Japanese fascist rule. However, disregarding the opposition of the Korean people, American imperialism seized the opportunity to send troops to southern Korea. Korea was divided into two occupation zones along the 38th parallel, with the Soviet Union stationed in the north and American imperialism stationed in the south. With the help of the Soviet Union, North Korea thoroughly destroyed feudal forces and fascist remnants, and implemented thorough reforms in the economic, political, and cultural fields. After completing these tasks, the Soviet troops completely withdrew back home on December 26, 1948. This great action once again demonstrated to the world that the socialist country of the Soviet Union is a country that truly safeguards peace, opposes aggression, and supports small and weak nations. However, the situation in South Korea was completely the opposite. Every move of American imperialism ran counter to the interests of the Korean people. It supported the traitor Syngman Rhee to organize a puppet government and implement a reign of terror. Under the reactionary and terrorist rule of American imperialism and its running dog, the Syngman Rhee puppet government, the South Korean working class and all patriots continuously launched heroic struggles through strikes and armed uprisings. From 1946 to October 1947, in less than a year, workers in South Korea held 2,388 strikes, with more than 586,000 workers participating. In October 1948, a large-scale armed uprising broke out. The insurgent army occupied major cities such as Incheon and Yaksu. More than 2,500 enlightened soldiers and police of the puppet government also participated in this armed uprising. The people of North Korea, with the strong assistance of the Soviet Union, launched a vigorous production and construction movement. The lives of the working class improved, and their cultural, technical, and political levels increased. The working class displayed great labor enthusiasm in the work of building the motherland, and production competitions and movements to learn from the Soviet Union were widely launched throughout the region. Last year, general elections were held throughout Korea. The people of South Korea also overcame various difficulties and found ways to elect their representatives to attend the conference in Pyongyang, North Korea. The entire Korean nation elected the Central People's Government headed by the national hero and Labor Party leader Kim Il-sung, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea was established. On October 6 this year, diplomatic relations were established with our country.
    During the Japanese rule, Korean workers had no opportunity to learn technology or manage factories. However, with the enthusiastic help of the Soviet Union, North Korea now has thousands of workers who have become engineers. A large number of foremen, technicians, and factory directors have also been promoted from among the workers.
    On the eve of its surrender, Japanese imperialism destroyed the blast furnaces and coal crushers of all steel factories, flooded the mines, and blew up bridges and railway tracks with explosives. About 80% of the vehicles were destroyed. However, thanks to the initiative and creativity of the Korean working class and the great assistance of the Soviet Union, North Korea has gradually overcome these difficulties and restored production. The total output in 1947 increased by two and a half times compared to 1946; the average output of workers increased by one and a half times. Last year's output increased three times compared to 1946. In the past, North Korea had hardly any decent machine manufacturing factories, and even batteries and telephones had to be purchased from Japan. However, in the second year after the Japanese surrender, North Korean workers created more than 70 new products, and last year they created more than 100 new products. This year, North Korean workers are also striving to complete the two-year production plan ahead of schedule. Next year, industry will increase by two times compared to last year, and the production plan for the first half of this year has been successfully completed.
    In addition to actively engaging in production, North Korean workers also actively participate in the work of various government departments. From the highest legislative body, the Supreme People's Assembly, and the highest administrative body, the People's Committee, down to local organs, workers' representatives participate. The Supreme People's Assembly has a total of 572 representatives, of which 120 are workers' representatives.
    In 1946, the People's Committee passed the "Labor Law," stipulating an eight-hour workday for workers, six hours for young workers, and seven hours for miners. In addition to Sundays, there are two weeks of vacation per year. Young workers and miners have even longer vacations, up to one month. The employment of underage children is prohibited, and factories harmful to health are prohibited from employing female workers. Equal pay for equal work is applied to both male and female workers. Female workers have maternity leave before and after childbirth and can receive maternity allowances. Workers who are temporarily or permanently incapacitated, those who are sick or disabled, or elderly workers can receive "social insurance benefits." More than 38,000 people received assistance from "social insurance benefits" within a year last year. In the past three years, the government has allocated more than 930 million yuan as "social insurance funds." The People's Committee has established a review committee to inspect factory technical safety equipment. Five sanatoriums have been established for workers. More than 22,000 workers rested there last year, and 900,000 workers received free medical treatment. Houses built by the Japanese in scenic areas in the past have now been allocated to workers. More than 15,000 workers moved into new houses last year.
    North Korean workers organized the "Federation of Trade Unions" in 1946, which now has more than 700,000 members. The Federation of Trade Unions is composed of seventeen industrial trade unions, leading more than 13,000 factory trade unions. Among these trade unions, there are more than 30,000 activists, ensuring the smooth progress of trade union work. Trade unions have played a significant role in workers' education, technical learning, and ensuring the completion of production tasks.
    The working classes of China and Korea should learn from each other, help each other, and unite together within the peace and democracy camp led by the Soviet Union, defeat American imperialism and the remaining forces of American imperialist running dogs, and strive to defend world lasting peace and people's democracy. Comrade Choi Ho-min, Secretary-General of the North Korean General Federation of Trade Unions, arrived in Beijing on the 30th of last month to attend the Asian-Australasian Trade Union Conference. The Chinese working class warmly welcomes the representatives of the Korean worker brothers.

　　朝鲜的工人阶级
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，在我国的东北部，和我国辽东省紧紧的接连着，中间只隔着一条鸭绿江，人口有两千二百多万，面积比我国的湖南省大一些。日本帝国主义从一九一○年起到一九四五年八月，统治朝鲜三十六年，在经济方面想尽方法垄断剥削，在政治方面实行法西斯统治，并且用各种手段想要消灭朝鲜的文化，当时朝鲜的学校里不许用朝鲜文的课本，平常就是说一句朝鲜的话也算犯罪的。在日本法西斯统治下，工人的生活更苦，每天要作十二个钟头以上的工，轻工业工人甚至要工作十六个钟头，女工或者童工干一样的活儿，工资只能抵得上普通男工的一半。一般工人都是吃不饱穿不暖，住在不见阳光的草棚里面，因为生活太苦，所以有百分之三十以上的工人害肺病。工人如果稍微表示不满意，工厂就会毫无理由的把他开除掉，或者押到监狱里，为了反抗这种残无人道的压迫，朝鲜工人在一九一二年一年以内，就发动过六次大罢工。一九二○年，朝鲜工人在朝鲜共产党的领导下，秘密地把工会组织起来了，一九二五年成立了全国工会联合会，全朝鲜的工人开始有了统一的领导组织，为了改善生活，为了民族的解放，他们向敌人展开了顽强不屈的斗争。一九二八年十二月到一九二九年的三月，运输工人进行了三个月的大规模的总罢工。
    一九四五年八月，苏联红军打垮了日本帝国主义，朝鲜才从日本法西斯的统治下解放出来，而美帝国主义不顾朝鲜人民的反对，乘机把军队开到朝鲜南部。朝鲜就以北纬三十八度为界，划分成两个占领区，苏联驻在北边，美帝国主义驻在南边。北朝鲜在苏联驻军帮助之下，彻底摧毁了封建势力和法西斯残余势力，经济、政治、文化各方面都实行了彻底的改革。苏联驻军完成了这些任务以后，在一九四八年十二月二十六号全部撤退回国，这一个伟大的行动，又一次向全世界表明了社会主义国家苏联是真正维护和平反对侵略扶助弱小民族的国家；可是南朝鲜的情形就完全相反，美帝国主义一举一动都是和朝鲜人民的利益相违背的，它扶持卖国贼李承晚组织傀儡政府，实行恐怖统治，在美帝国主义和它的走狗李承晚傀儡政府的反动恐怖统治下，南朝鲜工人阶级和一切爱国人士不断用罢工和武装起义展开了英勇的斗争。从一九四六年到一九四七年十月，不到一年的工夫，南朝鲜的工人就举行了两千三百八十八次罢工，参加罢工的工人有五十八万六千多人。一九四八年十月爆发了大规模的武装起义，起义的军队占领了仁川、岳苏等大城市，傀儡政府的两千五百多个觉悟了的军队和警察也参加了这次武装起义。北朝鲜的人民在苏联大力帮助下，展开了蓬蓬勃勃的生产建设运动，工人阶级的生活改善了，文化、技术和政治水平提高了，工人阶级在建设祖国的工作当中，发挥了伟大的劳动热情，各地普遍的展开了生产竞赛和向苏联学习的运动。去年全朝鲜举行了普选，南朝鲜的人民也克服了种种困难，想办法选出了自己的代表到北朝鲜的平壤去参加大会。全朝鲜选出了以民族英勇、劳工党领袖金日成为首的中央人民政府，成立了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，今年十月六号和我国建立了外交关系。
    在日本统治时期，朝鲜的工人是没有学习技术和管理工厂的机会的，可是在苏联的热心帮助下，北朝鲜现在已经有成千的工人成为了工程师。在工人中间还提拔了大批的监工，技术人员和厂长。
    日本帝国主义在投降的前夕，破坏了所有的钢铁工厂的鼓风炉和捣煤机，用水淹没了矿坑，用火药炸毁了桥梁和路轨，有百分之八十左右的车辆被破坏了。可是由于朝鲜工人阶级的积极性和创造性，以及苏联伟大的援助，北朝鲜现在已经逐渐克服了这些困难，恢复了生产。一九四七年的全部生产量比一九四六年就提高了两倍半；工人的平均产量提高了一倍半。去年的生产量又比一九四六年提高了三倍。过去北朝鲜几乎没有一个象样子的机器制造工厂，甚至于电池和电话机也需要向日本购买，可是在日本投降的第二年，北朝鲜的工人就创造了七十多种新成品，去年创造了一百多种新成品。今年北朝鲜的工人又为了提前完成两年生产计划而斗争，明年的工业将比去年的工业提高两倍，今年上半年的生产计划已经顺利地完成了。
    北朝鲜的工人除了积极生产以外，还积极地参加政府各部门的工作。上至最高的立法机关最高人民会议，和最高的行政机关人民委员会，下至地方机关，都有工人的代表参加，最高人民会议一共有五百七十二名代表，工人代表就占了一百二十名。
    一九四六年人民委员会通过了“劳动立法”，规定了工人每天工作八个钟头制度，青工六个钟头，矿井工人七个钟头。除了星期日休假以外，一年还有两个星期的休假，青工和矿工的假期还要更长一些，每年可以休息一个月，禁止雇用不成年的儿童作工，有害健康的工厂禁止雇用女工。男女工人同工同酬。女工在生产前后有休假，并且可以领取生育津贴。暂时或永久失去工作能力的工人，疾病残废或老年工人都可以得到“社会保险金”。前年一年以内就有三万八千多人得到“社会保险金”的帮助，三年以来，政府拿出了九万万三千多万元作为“社会保险基金”。为了检查工厂技术安全设备，人民委员会特别设立了一个审查委员会。为工人设立了五座疗养所，前年就有两万二千多工人在那里休息，有九十万工人得到免费治疗。日本人过去在风景区盖的房子，现在都拨给工人住，前年就有一万五千多个工人搬到新房子去住。
    北朝鲜的工人在一九四六年组织了“工会联合会”，现在拥有七十多万会员。工会联合会是由十七个产业工会组成的，领导着一万三千多个工厂的工会，在这些工会当中有三万以上的积极分子，保证工会工作能够顺利进行。工会在工人的教育方面和技术学习方面和保证完成生产任务当中，都起了很大的作用。
    中国和朝鲜两国的工人阶级，在建设国家的工作中间要互相学习，互相帮助，共同团结在以苏联为首的和平民主阵营里面，打垮美帝国主义和美帝国主义走狗的残余势力，为保卫世界持久和平和人民民主而努力。北朝鲜总工会秘书长崔浩敏同志已经在上月三十号到达北京参加亚澳工会会议，中国工人阶级热烈欢迎朝鲜工人弟兄的代表们。
