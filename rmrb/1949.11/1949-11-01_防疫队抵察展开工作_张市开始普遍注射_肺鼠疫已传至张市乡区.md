Pneumonic plague has spread to rural areas of Zhangjiakou city.

[Report from our newspaper in Zhangjiakou on the 31st at 2 PM] The Second Brigade of the Central Anti-epidemic Committee's Anti-epidemic Headquarters, comprising 150 people and carrying a large quantity of Soviet-made plague vaccine (enough for over 230,000 people including previously delivered doses), Soviet-made serum, and drugs such as methylene blue, streptomycin, and penicillin, arrived in Zhangjiakou at 7 AM today on a special train. After contacting the provincial anti-epidemic committee, the team immediately began work: (1) The team's Inner Mongolia anti-epidemic team of 37 people will be accompanied by 30 local medical personnel from the Chahar province to learn and assist. The ten-plus members of the North China anti-epidemic team previously sent to Chahar province are also subordinate to this team and are scheduled to depart by car for the epidemic areas of Chahar province in Inner Mongolia on the 1st. (2) The joint Northeast and North China anti-epidemic team of 80 people, which previously arrived in Zhangjiakou, is scheduled to depart for the Kangbao County epidemic area in northern Chahar on the 2nd. This team will also be accompanied by 30 local medical personnel from Chahar province to assist. The remaining hundred-plus members of the anti-epidemic team will remain stationed in Zhangjiakou city. According to the head of the anti-epidemic headquarters, Jiang Yaode, the anti-epidemic work in the Chahar and Mongolia regions will be uniformly directed by this team, and immediate efforts will be made to administer vaccines, disinfect, and catch rats and kill fleas, as well as begin manufacturing rat traps and rat poison.

[Further report] It has been confirmed that pneumonic plague has been discovered in a household in Jijiafangzi Village in the rural areas of Zhangjiakou City. A man from the village returned from Kangbao and fell ill on the 24th, dying the next day. After being buried, he was exhumed and examined, and secretions were found in his nostrils. A smear test conducted by the anti-epidemic team revealed bacteria resembling plague bacilli, and the body was subsequently cremated. His wife fell ill at 6 AM on the 29th and died at 11 AM the next day. After an autopsy by the anti-epidemic team, six slides were smeared from her lungs, and hundreds of plague bacilli could be seen in each field of view. The above situation was confirmed as plague at 11 PM on the 30th. The anti-epidemic team is now giving the village live bacteria injections, disinfection examinations, strict sealing and isolation to prevent it from spreading to the urban area. Universal anti-epidemic injections will begin immediately in Zhangjiakou City, with troops, agencies and schools having already begun injections this afternoon.

    【又电】张市乡区吉家房子村有一户确已发现肺鼠疫。该村有一男子从康保归来后，二十四日发病，次日即死去。埋后刨出检视，其鼻孔有分泌物。经防疫队涂片检查结果，发现类似鼠疫杆菌，后将尸体焚化。其妻二十九日上午六时发病，至次日上午十一时即死去。经防疫队解剖后，肺部涂了六个片子，每个视野，均可看出数百个鼠疫杆菌。以上情形在三十日下午十一时检验证实确系鼠疫。现防疫队首先给该村作生菌注射、消毒检诊、严密封锁隔离，以免延及市区。并于即日起在张市作普遍防疫注射，部队机关、学校已于今午开始注射。
