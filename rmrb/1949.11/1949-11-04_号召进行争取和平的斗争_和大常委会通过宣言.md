Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 3rd: TASS, Rome, 2nd: The Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress has passed a declaration at its second plenary session, the full text of which is as follows: It has been six months since representatives from seventy-two countries formulated the covenant of peace advocates in Paris. In this short period, several events of great significance in world history have occurred. These events have revealed to millions of people the threat to all mankind due to the sins of the forces of war, while also proving that the forces of peace are growing and uniting, and that these forces of peace are capable of preventing warmongers from launching new wars.

In China, peace advocates who were recently oppressed and persecuted now manage this democratic republic, which is based on the support of 500 million men and women standing at the forefront of peace advocates. The establishment of the German Democratic Republic in the very center of Europe has instilled in the peoples of this continent a hope that the forces that previously led to war and destruction can now be led to peace.

In those places in the world where everything is controlled by oppressive systems, imperialism, which implements colonial policies and is the basis of the constant threat to peace, is being shattered by the struggle of all ethnic groups to gain liberation, which is a new contribution to our cause. In countries subject to the Marshall Plan and the Atlantic Pact, as well as in the United States itself, the policy of attempting to launch new conflicts has been shaken by the impact of the crisis, which is worsening due to unproductive expenditures on war preparations. In France, Italy, and other countries, millions of people engaged in the struggle against poverty and war have united in the powerful movement of peace advocates to stop the plans of warmongers. The date of October 2 has demonstrated the success achieved by the unified forces of peace and the stability of the international connections that have been established.

Finally, the Soviet Union's repeated initiatives to consolidate peace (which revived hopes for international agreements) and its unwavering insistence that various social systems can coexist peacefully have made a significant contribution to the cause of peace advocates. The cause of peace advocates has also been strengthened by the peaceful revival of the people's democratic countries.

Faced with the strengthened peace front, the forces of war are stepping up their preparations and increasingly showing their plans to dominate the world, plans that are already causing the peoples of various countries to lose their national independence and economic independence, and that will also lead to war. If atomic monopoly ever existed, it no longer exists. In order to deceive the peoples of various countries and in order to obtain the signatures of various governments on the Atlantic Pact, the fact that atomic monopoly did not exist was only admitted after the conclusion of this pact. Now, the forces of war are not conducting appropriate negotiations, but are instead attempting to use the disappearance of this inherently unreliable monopoly as a new excuse to drag the world into an arms race. These forces of war are attempting to mislead public opinion again, asserting that the arms race will allow them to maintain a decisive military advantage.

In this way, they are eager to link the accelerated development of atomic weapons with the implementation of huge military programs and the increase in troop strength. This policy, which attempts to compensate for the reduction in the profits of large capitalists by means of armaments and war, forces those governments that meekly accept the Atlantic Pact to impose an increasingly heavy burden of military spending on their people.

The manipulation of currency, the reduction of appropriations for social needs, the reduction of consumer goods, and the poverty generated by these meaningless military expenditures, which are carried out under the command of this policy, have become one of the fundamental factors of the economic crisis. To justify their military expenditures and achieve their goals, the imperialist countries and their agents are trying to stir up a military mentality and complete the conditions for so-called preventive war. The forces of war respond with silence or refuse to discuss any suggestions that can rebuild confidence among the people, no matter where they come from. In West Germany, under the cover of a puppet separate government, they are pursuing a policy of restoring aggressive military and industrial power. In Japan, the same policy is being implemented by despicable methods. In addition, the advocates of preventive war are still using the situation in Yugoslavia today as a means of sabotage and an attempted aggressive diplomatic and military base. The current government of Yugoslavia has become a threat to peace due to its general behavior, especially its negotiations with the fascist government of Athens (which has struck a blow against the democratic forces of Greece) and its request to serve as a candidate for membership in the United Nations Security Council with destructive purposes. However, hundreds of millions of people around the world have sufficient power to subvert the plans of warmongers.

After listening to reports from national groups, the Standing Committee can confirm that the power of the organized peace advocacy movement is growing. To expand the scope of our work and ensure victory, we must concentrate our efforts on working in countries at the heart of new conspiracies, such as the United States and the United Kingdom, in Latin America, in colonies and dependent countries, and in countries oppressed by fascist dictatorships, where the struggle for peace is carried out under harsh and tragic conditions. There is one question on the agenda everywhere: to expand the national movement in order to attract millions of honest and conscious people to our struggle, who have a growing awareness of the unity of peace forces (no matter what political, religious or social differences may interfere with this unity). The forces of war must understand that a force has been born that can thwart their plans and can force those governments that obey the will of warmongers to maintain peace; they must understand that a force has been born that can spread the idea of peace throughout the world, discuss the issue of peace, and carry out the struggle for peace.

The Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress hereby appeals to representative organizations in all countries around the world: The Standing Committee recommends that they discuss peace proposals that express the hopes of the peoples of all nations; the Standing Committee recommends that they request their respective governments to support these proposals in the spirit of fidelity to the principles of the United Nations Charter and to use them as the basis of national policy. These proposals should include:

(1) Immediately begin direct negotiations under international control to stop the wars currently underway, especially in Greece, Vietnam, Indonesia, and Malaya.

(2) Immediately reduce armaments and troop strength; immediately declare atomic weapons illegal and destroy atomic weapons.

(3) Sign a peace treaty between the major powers within the United Nations framework.

The above two steps and preliminary agreements will be proof of a genuine desire for peace. It will help to rebuild mutual trust among nations and create peaceful conditions that can guarantee a peace treaty. The Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress will write its recommendations in an appeal to representative organizations of parliaments, districts, states, and local autonomous bodies. This appeal will be submitted to peace-loving people of all ethnic groups around the world for discussion and approval in the form of launching petitions, sending delegations, and launching mass movements of public opinion.

The Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress knows that the people now have sufficient means to compel respect for peace.

### 号召进行争取和平的斗争　和大常委会通过宣言

　　号召进行争取和平的斗争
  　和大常委会通过宣言
    【新华社北京三日电】塔斯社罗马二日电：世界拥护和平大会常设委员会顷在第二届全体会议通过宣言，全文如下：自从七十二个国家的代表们在巴黎制定和平拥护者的盟约以来，已有六个月了。在这短短的时期中，已发生了若干具有世界历史重大意义的事件。这些事件，对千百万人民揭示了由于战争力量的罪过而使全人类所面临的威胁，同时却又证明了，和平力量正在成长，正在团结一致，这些和平力量是能够防止战争贩子去发动新战争的。
    在中国，不久前还是被压迫与受迫害的和平拥护者，今天已管理着这个民主共和的国家了，这个国家是以站在和平拥护者之前列的五亿男女的支持为基础的。在欧洲正中心的德意志民主共和国的成立，给这个大陆上的各民族人民灌注了一个希望，即先前走向战争与毁灭的力量，现在已可能使之走向和平了。
    在世界上那些由压迫制度统制着一切的地方，作为对和平的经常威胁之基础的、执行殖民政策的帝国主义，正被各族人民争取解放的斗争所粉碎，这是对我们事业的一个新的贡献。在受制于马歇尔计划与大西洋公约的国家里，以及在美国本国，在因战争准备这种非生产性的支出而日益恶化的危机的冲击下，企图发动新冲突的政策已被动摇了。在法国，在意大利，以及在其他国家里，千百万进行着反贫穷、反战争斗争的人民，已经在制止战争贩子计划的和平拥护者的强有力的运动中团结起来了。十月二日这个日子，已表现出统一的和平力量所达成的成功与已建立起来的国际联系的稳固性。
    最后，苏联屡次倡议巩固和平（这倡议复活了对国际协议的希望），并始终不变地坚持各种不同的社会制度可以和平相处，这已造成对和平拥护者事业的意义重大的贡献。和平拥护者的事业，也因人民民主国家的和平的复兴而加强起来。
    面对着加强了的和平阵线，战争力量正加紧他们的准备工作，并且越来越显示出其称霸世界的计划，这些计划现在便已在使各国人民丧失民族独立与经济独立，而且还会引起战争。如果说原子垄断曾经存在过的话，那么现在已不复存在了。为了欺骗各族人民，并为了获得各国政府签字于大西洋公约上，因此就只在缔结了这个公约之后才承认原子垄断并不存在这一事实。现在，战争力量不进行适当的谈判，却尝试着去利用这本来就是靠不住的垄断的消失来作新的托辞，以便把世界拖入军备竞赛中去。这些战争力量企图再度把舆论引入歧途，断言军备竞赛将使他们可以保持着决定性的军事优势。
    这样，他们便亟欲把加速发展原子武器与实现庞大的军备计划和增加兵员联结起来。这一力图以军备和战争的手段补偿大资本家的利润减低的政策，强迫那些温驯地接受大西洋公约的政府以日益增加的沉重的军费负担加于其人民。
    在这一政策命令下所进行的操纵货币、减削供社会需用的拨款、减削消费品，以及由这些无意义的军费所产生的贫困，就成了经济危机的基本因素之一。为辩解他们的军事费用并达到其目的，帝国主义国家及其代理人力图煽起军事心理状态，并完成所谓预防性战争的条件。对于一切能在人民中重建信心的建议，不论其来自何处，战争的力量都报以沉默或拒绝加以讨论。在西德，在傀儡分立政府的掩护之下，他们奉行着恢复侵略性的军事力量和工业力量的政策。在日本，以卑鄙的方法在实行着同样的政策。此外，预防性战争的鼓吹者，今天还利用南斯拉夫的情势，作为破坏的手段和企图侵略的外交和军事基地。而南斯拉夫现政府，已因其一般的行为，特别是与雅典法西斯政府的谈判（这一谈判已打击了希腊的民主力量）以及心怀破坏性目的而要求充任联合国安理会理事的候选者，而成为对和平的威胁了。然而，全世界亿万人民都有充分的力量来颠覆战争贩子的计划。
    常设委员会在听取了各国团体的报告以后，可以确定：有组织的和平拥护者运动的威力，正在日益增长着。为了扩大我们工作的范围并保证胜利，我们必须集中力量，在象美国和英国这些新阴谋之核心的国家中进行工作，在拉丁美洲，在殖民地和附属国，在那些被法西斯独裁所压迫的，拥护和平的斗争在严酷悲惨的条件下进行的国家中，进行工作。各处日程上都有了一个问题，这便是扩大民族运动，以便把数以百万计的正直的有觉悟的人民吸引到我们的斗争中来，他们已有了希望和平力量团结（无论是政治的、宗教的或社会的任何分歧，都干扰不了这种团结）的觉悟。战争的力量必须了解：有一种力量已经诞生了，这种力量能挫败他们的计划，并能强迫那些顺从战争贩子之意志的政府保持和平；他们必须了解：这一种力量已经诞生了，它能在全世界传播和平的思想，讨论和平的问题并进行争取和平的斗争。
    世界拥护和平大会常设委员会谨向全世界一切国家的代表组织发出呼吁：常委会建议它们讨论表示着各民族人民之希望的和平建议，常委会建议它们要求各该国政府以忠于联合国宪章原则的精神来支持这些建议，并以之作为国策的基础。这些建议应包括：
    （一）立即开始在国际管制下进行直接谈判，以停止现在进行中的、特别是在希腊、越南、印尼、马来亚进行的战争。
    （二）立即裁减军备和兵员；立即宣布原子武器为非法，并销毁原子武器。
    （三）在联合国机构内签订大国间的和平公约。
    上述头两项步骤及初步协议将成为真正渴望和平的证明。它将有助于重建各民族的互信及创设能保证和平公约的和平条件。世界拥护和平大会常设委员会将把它的建议写在致议会和区、州、地方自治团体等代表组织的呼吁书中。这一呼吁，将以发动请愿、派遣代表团和发动舆论的群众运动的方式，提交全世界爱好和平的各族人民加以讨论和批准。
    世界拥护和平大会常设委员会知道：现在人民拥有充分的方法来强使和平受到尊重。
