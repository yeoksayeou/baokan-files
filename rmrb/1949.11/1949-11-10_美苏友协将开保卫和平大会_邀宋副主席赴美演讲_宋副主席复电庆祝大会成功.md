To Madam Sun Yat-sen:

Our association is scheduled to hold its annual Peace Conference on December 5th at Madison Square in New York, with 20,000 people participating. We will mobilize the people to demand a ban on atomic bombs, an end to the Cold War, and call for the international cooperation necessary for peace and security. If you could attend and speak on behalf of the people of New China, it would add immeasurable strength to this grand event, which is recognized as having a major impact both domestically and internationally. Please consider our friendly and urgent invitation. The American people will sincerely welcome your arrival. We will prepare everything for your journey. We eagerly await your reply.

To Dr. John Kingsbury, National Council of the American-Soviet Friendship Association:

Thank you for your invitation. Due to pressing affairs to be handled, coupled with health reasons, I am unable to comply, and I am very sorry! I wish the conference success. Please convey to the American people that the liberated Chinese people will join hands with them to strive for peace, understanding, and friendship, and to fight against wars and destruction that would destroy civilization. The dawn of liberation for all mankind has broken, and the tide of people's power cannot be stopped. We must redouble our efforts for the construction of world peace.

Soong Ching Ling
