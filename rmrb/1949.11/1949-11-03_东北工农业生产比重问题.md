The Proportion of Industry and Agriculture in Northeast China
Wang Sihua, Director of the Survey and Statistics Department of the Northeast China Finance and Economics Committee

In all of China, the Northeast has a relatively developed industry; therefore, the proportion of agricultural production to industrial production in the Northeast is relatively high. This was the case during the puppet Manchukuo period, and it is still the case now. The issue of the proportion of industrial production is "the basic starting point for all issues during the Chinese revolutionary period and for a considerable period after the victory of the revolution, from which a series of strategic, tactical, and policy issues of our Party arise." This issue is also very important in the implementation of the national economic plan in the Northeast. Therefore, we have a special need to study it.

According to the materials of the puppet Manchukuo, assuming that the annual industrial production and agricultural production are 100, then the composition of production in the puppet Manchukuo era is as shown in the first table:

Industry Two, Nine Two Nine Two, Three Two Five (54) Four, Four Six Eight Two, Three Seven Seven (59)
Agriculture Two, Four Seven Seven One, Nine Six Six (46) Three, One Zero Nine One, Six Five Four (41)

During the puppet Manchukuo era, the proportion of industrial production in Northeast China obviously increased year by year, while agricultural production relatively declined.

After August 15th, Northeast industry suffered a great deal of damage from the enemy, puppets, and the Kuomintang, and its production greatly decreased. After the complete liberation of Northeast China, although we have made great efforts to restore it, the current industrial production is still far below the production level of the puppet Manchukuo era. So, what is the value of industrial production in Northeast China this year? At present, we still lack reliable statistical materials, but according to our calculations, the value of industrial production of state-owned and public-owned industries in Northeast China this year is 358.407 billion yuan, which can be converted into 8,960,000 tons of grain at 4 million yuan per ton. The estimated value of private industrial production is 1,280,000 tons, totaling 10,240,000 tons. The total value of agricultural production this year is 19,290,000 tons. Then, the proportion of industry and agriculture this year is as shown in the second table:

Second Table Comparison of the Total Value of Industrial and Agricultural Production in Northeast China in 1949 (Estimated Figures) (Note 2) (Attached Chart)
Tonnage Percentage
⒈ Total Value of Industrial Production 10,240,000 tons 35
⒉ Total Value of Agricultural Production 19,292,000 tons 65
Total 29,532,000 tons 100

This proportion of industry and agriculture is, of course, much lower than that in the later period of the puppet Manchukuo era, but it is much higher than that of the whole country. (It is estimated that the value of industrial production in the whole country accounts for about 10 percent of the national economy.)

Secondly, compared with the Soviet Union, the current proportion of industrial production in Northeast China is also higher than that in the Soviet Union in the years after the success of the revolution. Only during the New Economic Policy period did Soviet industrial production gradually recover and develop. For the convenience of comparison, we have listed the proportion of the value of industrial and agricultural production in the Soviet Union over the years in the third table:

Third Table Comparison of the Value of Industrial and Agricultural Production in the Soviet Union (Note 3) (Attached Chart)
Industry Agriculture Total
1913 42 58 100
1917 26 74 100
1920 14 86 100
1923 30 70 100
1925 42 58 100
1928 48 52 100
1932 71 29 100
1937 77 23 100
1940 86 14 100

Industrial production in Northeast China is divided into two types: one is public-owned (including state-owned and public-owned) industrial production, and the other is private industrial production. So, what is the ratio of the total value of these two types of industrial production? According to the statistics of the Northeast Electric Power Bureau in January this year, the power consumption of public-owned industries accounted for 87.3 percent, and the power consumption of private industries accounted for 12.7 percent, that is, the power consumption of private industries is about one-seventh of that of public-owned industries. Although the productivity of public-owned industries is greater than that of private industries, the use of electricity is more wasteful than that of private industries. Therefore, according to the power consumption, we estimate that the value of private industrial production is about one-seventh of the value of public-owned industrial production. According to the actual production value of public-owned enterprises in the Lushun-Dalian area in 1948, which was 92.59 billion yuan, and the actual production value of private enterprises, which was 13.893 billion yuan, the ratio of public-owned to private-owned is about seven to one. Based on the above two materials, we can calculate the ratio of the total value of public-owned and private industrial production in Northeast China this year, as shown in the fourth table:

Fourth Table Comparison of the Total Value of Public-owned and Private Industrial Production in Northeast China (Attached Chart)
Value Percentage
Total Value of Public-owned Industrial Production 8,960,000 tons 87.5
Total Value of Private Industrial Production 1,280,000 tons 12.5
Total 10,240,000 tons 100

At present, the proportion of public-owned industries is far greater than that of private industries. This is one of the characteristics of industry in Northeast China.

If compared with the Soviet Union, the current ratio of the total value of public-owned and private industrial production in Northeast China is equivalent to that of the Soviet Union under the New Economic Policy in 1926-1927. We can see the fifth table listed:

Fifth Table The Proportion of the Socialized Sector in the Value of Industrial Production in the Soviet Union (Percentage) (Note 4) (Attached Chart)
1913 1923-24 1924-25
Socialized Sector 1 75.3 81.3
Private Sector 100.0 24.7 18.7
1925-26 1926-27
Socialized Sector 83.7 85.9
Private Sector 16.3 14.1
1928-29 1932 1937
Socialized Sector 89.5 99.5 99.8
Private Sector 10.5 0.5 0.2

What conclusions can we draw from the above statistics?

First, in the proportion of the national economy, Northeast China currently has more than 30 percent of the modern industrial economy, and it is expected to rapidly recover to the production level of the puppet Manchukuo era within a few years. That is to say, Northeast China may have more than 50 percent of the modern industrial economy within a few years. In this respect, Northeast China has a great impetus to the industrialization of the whole country, and it must help the rapid development of the national industry. These modern industries in Northeast China are now owned by all the Chinese people. This part of the economy, because it is owned by the people's government led by the working class, is an economy of a socialist nature, and this part of the economy is the leading component of the new democratic economy.

Second, Northeast China currently has 65 percent of the scattered individual agricultural economy, which requires us to patiently and systematically educate and lead them to gradually develop towards cooperation, modernization, and collectivization, so as to gradually develop the new democratic economy in the direction of the socialist economy.

Third, private industries in Northeast China (including capitalist enterprises and small commodity production departments) still account for one-seventh of industrial production, which is an economic force that cannot be ignored. Due to the relatively backward economy of the entire Northeast, especially the national economy, they must be allowed to exist and develop in the new democratic economic policy and economic plan.

Note 1: Industrial products are calculated according to the ex-factory price of each industrial product. Agricultural products are calculated according to the purchase price at the place of origin, plus the bonus as the unit price. If calculated according to the international price of agricultural products, the total value of agricultural products in 1931 would be 861,000,000 yuan, and the proportion of industrial and agricultural production would be 21 and 79; the total value of agricultural products in 1935 would be 1,479,000,000 yuan, and the proportion of industrial and agricultural production would be 27 and 73; the total value of agricultural products in 1940 would be 3,206,000,000 yuan, and the proportion of industrial and agricultural production would be 48 and 52; the total value of agricultural products in 1943 would be 3,752,000,000 yuan, and the proportion of industrial and agricultural production would be 54 and 46. Secondly, industrial products do not include the products of the following factories: railway factories, Tonghe automobile factories, Fengtian arsenal, Manchuria Oil and Chemical Plant, Miyata Manufacturing Co., Benxi Coal Mine, Fushun Oil Refinery, Manchuria Aircraft Factory, Domestic Electric Company, and small factories with less than five workers. Therefore, the actual value of industrial products may be higher; but what we calculate here is the total value of industrial products, so there is also a place for repeated calculations here. Agricultural products include cereals, industrial agricultural materials, vegetables, etc., but forestry and animal husbandry products are not included. The industrial and mining products and agricultural products include the Lushun-Dalian area and the former Xing'an Province.

Note 2: The total agricultural products of various provinces and cities in Northeast China in 1949 were 15,732,000 tons, the Lushun-Dalian area produced 345,000 tons, and the rural sideline production was 3,215,000 tons, totaling 19,292,000 tons. The estimated value of state-owned industrial production in 1949 was 243.177 billion (including 226.407 billion for the Ministry of Industry and 16.77 billion for the railway), and the public-owned industries in various provinces and cities accounted for about one-tenth of the production value of the Ministry of Industry, estimated at 22.64 billion, plus the industrial production value of the Lushun-Dalian area of 92.59 billion, totaling 358.407 billion, which can be converted into 8,960,000 tons of grain at 4 million yuan per ton.

According to the statistical materials of the Lushun-Dalian area in 1948, an industrial worker can produce an average of 26 tons of grain per year. This year, the average number of workers in public-owned industries in Northeast China is about 340,000 (including about 220,000 for the Ministry of Industry, about 10,000 for the railway, about 80,000 for Dalian, and about 30,000 for various provinces and cities). Then, the total value of public-owned industrial production in Northeast China this year is 8,840,000 tons of grain. This estimated figure is also close to the above estimated figure.

The value of industrial production does not include the figures of small industries.

　　东北工农业生产比重问题
    东北财经委员会  调查统计处处长  王思华
    在全中国，东北的工业比较发达，因此，东北农业生产对工业生产的比重较高。过去伪满时是这样，就是现在也是这样。工业生产比重问题，“这是在中国革命时期内及在革命胜利以后一个相当长的时期内一切问题的基本出发点，从这点出发产生了我党一系列的战略上策略上和政策上的问题”。这个问题，在东北实行国民经济计划中，也是一个很重要的问题。所以我们对它有特别提出来研究的必要。
    根据伪满材料，假定每年的工业生产与农业生产是一百，那么，伪满时代历年生产的构成便如第一表：
    第一表　　东北工业与农业的生产价值比较（注一）（附图表）

      百万元    单位：万吨   百分比   百万元     单位：万吨  百分比总计  五、四○六　四、二九一　(100)　 七、五七七 四、○三一　(100)工业  二、九二九　二、三二五 （五四） 四、四六八 二、三七七 （五九）农业  二、四七七　一、九六六 （四六） 三、一○九 一、六五四 （四一）
    伪满时代，东北工业生产的比重，历年来，显然是增加着，而农业生产则相对地低落着。
    八一五后，东北工业遭受敌伪与国民党的大量破坏，其生产大为降低。东北全部解放后，我们虽用大力恢复，然而目前工业生产还远不及伪满时代的生产水平。那么，今年东北工业生产价值到底有多少呢？目前我们还缺乏可靠的统计材料，不过根据我们的计算，今年东北国营及公营工业生产价值，为三五八、四○七亿元，按四百万元一吨折粮，可折合八、九六○、○○○吨粮。私营工业生产价值，估计为一、二八○、○○○吨，两项共为一○、二四○、○○○吨。今年农业生产总值为一九、二九○、○○○吨。那么，今年工农生产的比重便如第二表：
    第二表　东北一九四九年工业与农业生产总值比表（估计数字）（注二）（附图表）吨数  百分比⒈工业生产总值　一○、二四○、○○○吨  三五⒉农业生产总值　一九、二九二、○○○吨　六五总计　二九、五三二、○○○吨　　　　　 １００
    这个工农比重，比伪满时代后期，固然降低了许多，但比起全国来，则高得多。（估计：全国工业生产价值，在国民经济比重中，约占百分之十。）
    其次，比起苏联来，目前东北工业生产比重，也高过于苏联革命成功后的几年。苏联只有在新经济政策时期，苏联工业生产才逐渐恢复并发展起来。为了便于比较起见，我们将苏联历年来工业与农业生产价值比重，列为第三表：
    第三表　苏联工业与农业生产价值的比较（注三）（附图表）工业  农业  计一九一三  四二  五八  １００一九一七  二六  七四  １００一九二○  一四  八六  １００一九二三  三○  七○  １００一九二五  四二  五八  １００一九二八  四八  五二  １００一九三二  七一  二九  １００一九三七  七七  二三  １００一九四○　八六  一四  １００
    东北工业生产，分为两种：一种是公营（包括国营与公营）工业生产，一种是私营工业生产。那么，这两种工业生产总值之比又是怎样呢？根据今年一月份东北电业总局的统计，公营工业用电量占百分之八七·三，私营工业用电量占百分之一二·七，即私营工业用电约为公营七分之一。公营工业生产力虽较私营为大，但使用电力较私营为浪费，因此，我们根据用电量，估计私营工业生产价值，约为公营工业生产价值的七分之一。又根据旅大地区公营企业一九四八年实际生产价值为九二、五九○亿元，私营企业实际生产价值为一三、八九三亿元，公营与私营之比，约为七与一。根据以上两个材料，我们可以计算今年东北公营与私营工业生产总值之比，如第四表：
    第四表　东北公营工业与私营工业生产总值比较（附图表）金额  百分比公营工业生产总值  八、九六○、○○○吨　八七·五私营工业生产总值  一、二八○、○○○吨　一二·五合计  一○、二四○、○○○吨  １００
    现在公营工业的比重，远比私人工业为大。这是东北工业的特点之一。
    如果拿苏联来比较，现在东北公营工业与私营工业的生产总值之比，正当于一九二六年至一九二七年新经济政策下的苏联。我们可看第五表所列：
    第五表　苏联工业生产价值中社会化部分所占的比重（百分数）（注四）（附图表）一九一三  一九二三——二四　一九二四——二五工社会化部分　一　七五·三   八一·三工业私营部分　１００．０ 　二四·七　一八·七一九二五——二六　一九二六——二七工社会化部分　八三·七　八五·九业  私营部分　一六·三 　一四·一一九二八——二九  一九三二一九三七工业社会化部分　八九·五  九九·五   九九·八工业私营部分　一○·五　○·五  ○·二
    从以上的统计数字，我们可以得出什么结论呢？
    第一、在国民经济比重中，东北目前约有百分之三十以上的现代化的工业经济，并在数年内可望迅速恢复到伪满时代生产水平，这就是说，东北在数年之内便可能有百分之五十以上的现代化的工业经济。在这方面看来，东北对全国的工业化，有很大的推动作用，它必须帮助全国工业迅速发展起来。东北这些现代工业现都已属于全中国人民所有了。这一部分经济，因为是归工人阶级领导的人民政府所有，所以是社会主义性质的经济，这一部分经济是新民主主义经济的领导成份。
    第二、东北目前尚有百分之六十五的分散的个体的农业经济，这就需要我们有耐心的有计划的教育与领导它们逐步的向着合作化向着现代化和集体化的方面发展，以便使新民主义经济向社会主义经济方向逐步发展。
    第三、东北私人工业（包括着资本主义企业与小商品生产部门），在工业生产中，还占有七分之一的比重，这是一个不可忽视的经济力量。由于整个东北经济特别全国经济还相当落后，它们必须在新民主主义的经济政策和经济计划中，容许存在与发展。
    注一：工业品是按各工业品出厂价格计算的。农业品系按出产地收买价格，加上奖励金为单价而算出的。如按农业品的国际价格计算。则一九三一年农产品总值便为八六一、○○○千圆，工农生产的比重便为二一与七九；一九三五年农产品总值便为一、四七九、○○○千圆，工农生产的比重便为二七与七三；一九四○年农产品总值便为三、二○六、○○○千圆，工农生产的比重便为四八与五二；一九四三年农产品总值便为三、七五二、○○○千圆，工农生产的比重便为五四与四六。其次，工业产品中，不包括下列各厂的产品：铁路工厂、同和汽车工厂、奉天兵工厂、满洲油化工厂、宫田制作所、本溪煤矿、抚顺制油厂、满洲飞机厂、国产电气公司、以及工人五名以下的小工厂。因此，实际的工业产品价值，可能更高；但我们这里计算的，是工业产品总值，因此，在这里又有重复计算的地方。农业品中包括谷类，工业用农业物，蔬菜等等，但林业与牧畜业产品不包括在内。在工矿产品与农产品中包括旅大地区及原兴安省在内。
    注二：全东北各省市一九四九年农产品共为一五、七三二、○○○顿，旅大地区产三四五、○○○顿，农村副业为三、二一五、○○○顿，共为一九、二九二、○○○顿。一九四九年国营工业生产价值估计为二四三、一七七亿（内工业部二二六、四○七亿，铁路一六、七七○亿），各省市公营工业约占工业部生产价值十分之一，估计为二二、六四○亿，再加上旅大地区工业生产价值九二、五九○亿，共为三五八、四○七亿，以四百万元一吨粮计算，可折合八、九六○、○○○顿粮。
    又根据旅大地区一九四八年统计材料，一个产业工人一年平均可生产二六吨粮。东北公营工业今年平均约有三十四万工人（内工业部约二十二万，铁路约一万，大连约八万，各省市约三万）那么，今年东北公营工业生产总值便为八、八四○、○○○吨粮。这个推算数字也与以上估计数字相近。
