Starting from "Deng Naiping"
    Li Han

    Seeing the news published in the People's Daily on the 2nd of this month, "Deng Naiping, having been a probationary party member for half a year, showed no qualities of a Communist Party member. The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party decided to revoke his probationary membership," it makes me feel that this is an event that should arouse high vigilance among general progressive youths.

    Deng Naiping is merely a representative of this type of intellectual – those who have been deeply influenced by opposing class families or deeply contaminated by the old society, who have been "active" due to the revolutionary upsurge and encouraged by the national victory, and have joined the revolutionary ranks, even the Communist Party. However, along with them, their old anti-proletarian ideas are also brought into the revolutionary ranks and are increasingly exposed and developed. Thus, a person like Deng Naiping is produced.

    The anti-proletarian ideological tendency is not just Deng Naiping's problem, but an ideological problem existing among some old intellectuals, a problem representing the ideological tendency of alien classes. Therefore, every progressive youth should intensify their study and application of the weapons of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to expose and liquidate their old ideas, and resolutely struggle against all thoughts, will, emotions, and styles that are opposed to the proletariat.

    This kind of anti-Party, anti-proletarian ideological tendency exists to varying degrees among general intellectuals who have not undergone revolutionary training. In their understanding of current political issues, they all have blind orthodox concepts. Such as worshiping "heroes" of the reactionary classes, worshiping the false "democracy" of American imperialism, talking about international affairs as a "struggle between the Soviet Union and the United States," talking about domestic affairs as a "struggle between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party," believing that the people's democratic united front is a "conspiracy," and so on. Regarding their attitude and relationship with the organization, they have individualistic and anti-organizational thoughts. Such as seeing the leadership of the Party as "manipulation," seeing democratic centralism as "dictatorship," seeing individual obedience to the organization as "blind obedience," believing that systems are all restrictions on people, and seeing reports as "espionage," and so on. Regarding their attitude towards the laboring masses, they despise or even are hostile to the working people. Such as disliking the "dirty and clumsy" hands and feet of workers and peasants, seeing Yangko dancing as something done by vulgar people, creating sectarianism and disunity with cadres from worker and peasant backgrounds, and so on, as well as competing for fame and status, putting on airs, aiming too high, being flashy but without substance, and other bad lifestyle habits. These are all a series of old thoughts and old styles.

    The above-mentioned non-proletarian and anti-proletarian thoughts and styles are precisely the objects we want to transform and the enemies of progress. Every youth who seeks progress should take Deng Naiping as a lesson, strictly examine themselves, modestly carry out self-transformation, and abandon all old thoughts and old styles.

    In order to maintain the purity of the Party, maintain the glorious title of a Communist Party member, and enforce the discipline of the Party, every Communist Party member should take Deng Naiping as a warning, be highly vigilant and examine themselves, carry out a resolute struggle against all non-proletarian thoughts, promptly discover and correct them, strengthen Party spirit training, strengthen their ideological, political, and organizational cultivation, and improve their class consciousness and revolutionary qualities.

    As for Deng Naiping himself and people similar to Deng Naiping, there is no need to be discouraged or stubbornly resist from now on. They should adopt the attitude of "all past things are as if they died yesterday," resolutely correct their mistakes, happily and sincerely accept the Party's punishment, and honestly re-transform themselves. As long as they are determined to make progress, there is still a bright future. For revolutionaries, the important thing is not whether they have shortcomings, but whether they can thoroughly correct them.

    The Chinese proletariat's party – the Chinese Communist Party always abides by Lenin's instruction: "We wear spotless shirts," and therefore does not allow even a speck of dust to contaminate our bodies. At any time, sweep away dust, wash away dirt, carry out ideological struggle, overcome all anti-proletarian and non-proletarian thoughts, and forever maintain the purity of the Party.

### 从“邓乃平”谈起

　　从“邓乃平”谈起
    李韩
    看到本月二号人民日报登载“邓乃平入党半年毫无共产党员品质，中共北京市委会决定取消其候补党员资格”的新闻，使我感到：这是足以使一般进步青年引起高度警惕的事件。
    邓乃平，他不过是这种知识青年类型的代表——即受反对阶级家庭影响较深或在旧社会受沾染较深的、有着反无产阶级思想倾向的人们，被革命高潮所推动和被全国胜利形势所鼓舞而“积极”起来，参加了革命队伍，甚至参加了共产党，但跟着，他们的反无产阶级的旧思想，也一起带到革命队伍中，并且日益暴露与发展。这样，就产生了邓乃平这样一种人。
    反无产阶级的思想倾向，不仅是邓乃平一个人的问题，而是在一部分旧知识分子中存在着的思想问题，是代表异己阶级的思想倾向问题。因此，每一进步青年，应当加紧学习与运用马列主义、毛泽东思想的武器，来揭发与清算自己的旧思想，并同一切与无产阶级相对立的思想、意志、情感、作风，进行坚决的斗争。
    这种反党的，反无产阶级的思想倾向，在未受过革命锻炼的一般知识分子中，或多或少都是存在的。在时事政治问题的认识上，他们都有盲目的正统观念。如崇拜反动阶级的“英雄”，崇拜美帝国主义虚伪的“民主”，谈国际是“苏美争霸”，谈国内是“国共之争”，认为人民民主统一战线是“阴谋手腕”等等。对组织的态度与关系上，他们有着个人主义的反组织的思想。如把党的领导看成“操纵”，把民主集中制看成“独裁”，把个人服从组织看成“盲从”，认为制度都是束缚人的，汇报是“谍报”等等。对劳动大众的态度上，是轻视甚至敌视劳动人民的。如讨厌“又脏又笨”的工农的手脚、把扭秧歌看成是下流人做的事，和工农出身的干部闹宗派闹不团结等等，以及争名誉、争地位、摆臭架子、好高骛远，华而不实等等坏的生活作风，这都是旧思想旧作风的一系列。
    上述这些非无产阶级与反无产阶级的思想和作风，正是我们要改造的对象，正是进步的敌人。每个要求进步的青年，应以邓乃平为借鉴，严格检讨自己，虚心进行自我改造，抛弃一切旧思想与旧作风。
    为着保持党的纯洁，保持共产党员的光荣称号，严肃党的纪律，每个共产党员，均应以邓乃平为戒，高度警惕自己与检查自己，对一切非无产阶级思想进行坚决的斗争，即时发现，即时纠正，加强党性锻炼，加强自己在思想上、政治上与组织上的修养，提高自己的阶级觉悟与革命品质。
    至于邓乃平本人以及和邓乃平相类似的人，也不必要从此灰心失望或顽固到底。应当抱着“过去种种譬如昨日死”的态度，坚决改正错误，愉快地并诚心地接受党的处分，老老实实地重新改造自己，只要决心进步，将来还是有光明前途的。对于革命者，重要的不是在于他身上有没有缺点，而是在于他能否彻底改正缺点。
    中国无产阶级的党——中国共产党始终遵守着列宁的指示：“我们穿着洁白的衫衣”，因而就不容许有半点灰尘沾污我们的肌体。随时清扫灰尘，洗涤污垢，进行思想斗争，克服一切反无产阶级以及非无产阶级的思想，永远保持住党的纯洁。
