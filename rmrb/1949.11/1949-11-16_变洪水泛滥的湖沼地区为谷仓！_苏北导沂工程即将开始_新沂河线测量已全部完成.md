Transforming Flood-Prone Marshland into Granaries!
	The Subei Yi River Diversion Project is About to Begin
	The Survey of the New Yi River Line is Complete

[News from our paper] The Subei New Yi River diversion project is about to begin. From Zhouzui in Xin'an County to Guanhe River in Guanyun County, across 188 kilometers of land, starting from late this month, 200,000 laborers (later to be increased to 500,000) will gradually complete 7,367,000 cubic meters of accumulated earth within two to three years, transforming flood-prone marshland into granaries.

As early as August of this year, the Yi-Shu Surveying Team of the Subei Administrative Office, consisting of more than 210 people, traversed mountains and rivers to survey the terrain and water conditions. They have now completed the water volume survey of 83 kilometers of the New Yi River line and are continuing to survey areas where the water has just receded.

The Huaiyin Special District, responsible for the entire project, is actively carrying out preparatory work. In mid-October, the local CPC committee instructed all regions to combine the mobilization for early autumn planting with guaranteeing the timely opening of the river in celebrating the birth of New China. On the 25th, it convened a joint meeting of county party secretaries to specifically arrange various preparatory tasks, deciding that the following six major tasks must be done before the start of the work: mobilizing laborers, supplying grain, relocating residents of river pools, to ensure the victorious start of work as scheduled.

The broad masses of farmers in the Yi River and Shu River area who have suffered from floods are jubilant about this good news and are actively preparing tools for opening the river. Production Promotion Cooperatives in various counties are supplying laborers with tools for opening the river, using 200,000 catties of grain as funds to order 10,000 iron shovels from blacksmith shops. The Huaiyin Special Administrative Office's Production and Construction Department sent personnel to Zaozhuang, Shandong, to purchase 200 tons of coal, which will be used for the repair and manufacture of river work machinery. More than 4,000 households will be relocated within the New Yi River line. In order to better guarantee their lives, the People's Government has stipulated that one room will be allocated, and each household will be given 150 catties of stakes and 200 catties of straw. Under the slogans of "One household's trouble, ten thousand households' benefit" and "Temporary trouble, eternal benefit," the residents are starting to relocate.

To facilitate the smooth progress of the project, 3,600 cadres who have undergone short-term training will participate in various aspects of the river opening work. Currently, supply personnel are working hard to complete the transportation of 70 million catties of grain to fully supply the laborers opening the river with food.

　　变洪水泛滥的湖沼地区为谷仓！
  　苏北导沂工程即将开始       
    新沂河线测量已全部完成
    【本报讯】苏北新沂河导治工程，即将开始。从新安县的周嘴到灌云县的灌河，一百八十八公里的土地上，自本月下旬起，将有二十万民工（以后将增至五十万民工），开始逐步地在二年到三年内完成七百三十六万七千公方的积土，将洪水泛滥的湖沼地区变为谷仓。
    早在今年八月，苏北行署的沂沭测勘总队二百一十余人，即跋山涉水，测勘地形水势，现已完成新沂河线八十三公里的水量，并继续测量积水初退地区。
    担负全部工程的淮阴专区，正在积极进行准备工作，十月中旬，中共地委即指示各地在庆祝新中国诞生中，要结合动员提早秋种，保证及时开河；二十五日又召开了县委书记联席会议，具体布置各项准备工作，决定开工前要做好：民工动员、粮食供应、河潭居民迁居等六大任务，保证如期胜利开工。
    在沂河、沭河线遭受洪水苦难的广大农民，正为这一喜讯而欢欣鼓舞，积极准备开河用具。各县生产推进社为供应民工开河用具，以二十万斤粮食的经费，向铁铺定制一万把铁锹；淮阴专署生产建设处派专人到山东枣庄购煤二百吨，将用于河工器械的修造上。在新沂河线内将有四千余户迁居，人民政府为了更好的保证他们的生活，规定拨一间房了，发给桩头一百五十斤，草二百斤。在“一户麻烦，万户享福”，“一时麻烦，万世享福”的口号下，各居民正在开始迁移。
    为便于指导工程顺利进行，将有三千六百个经过短期训练的干部参加开河各项工作。现各供应人员正为完成七千万斤粮食调运而努力，以便充分供给开河民工食用粮食。
