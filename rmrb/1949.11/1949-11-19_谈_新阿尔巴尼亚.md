Talking About "New Albania"
By Enver Hoxha, General Secretary of the Albanian Workers' Party, Translated by Li Qiao

For the first time in its history, the Albanian people have their own film, which truthfully and clearly depicts the past and present of the Albanian people. We should thank the friendly Soviet people, the Soviet government, and the great Stalin for the presentation of this beautiful film. The photographer Ilya Kopalin, recipient of the Stalin Prize, who was sent to our country, used exceptional artistic skill to write on the screen the life, emotions, and will of the few freedom-loving Albanian people—the Albanian people who steadfastly defend their independence and freedom.

Only Soviet artists and Soviet film techniques can convey the simple and true face of our people in such concise and grand scenes on the screen. In the film "New Albania," these scenes are presented to us. In order to create this film, one must love our people, understand their national characteristics and the emotions deep in their souls. The film "New Albania" is a powerful proof of the principle of the unity of the working people of the world, a spirit with which the great Lenin-Stalin party inspires and educates the Soviet people.

The Albanian people welcomed this film with fervent enthusiasm. Miners in the mines, workers in the factories, peasants, mountain people, and city dwellers saw from this film how Albanians have gone through the difficult road of fighting for national liberation, and saw the prospect of a happy life in the future, in the construction of which our people are dedicating all their strength.

The film "New Albania" begins with a soaring eagle, symbolizing the strength and freedom of our people. The eagle flies leisurely over the peaks of the mountains. These snow-covered mountains have been the invincible bulwark of our ancestors, our brave people, for centuries. These people never wanted to be slaves, but fought with weapons in their hands against the cruel enemy—the imperialists. These mountains are so noble to us because no enemy of our country can ever invade these mountains again and establish their barbaric slave system there. It was in these mountains and behind these natural fortresses towering over the cliffs that the Albanians, under the leadership of Skanderbeg, fought against the autocratic monarch Stan Bratty. Twenty-five years later, on the fortresses of these mountains, the red flag with the double-headed eagle fluttered, refusing to submit to the hateful green flag of Islam. In these mountains, our peasants shed blood fighting against the vampire-like feudal lords. In these mountains, Albanian patriots fought against the imperialists of Italy, Hungary, Austria, and Greece who attempted to enslave and divide our country. In these mountains, our glorious guerrillas fighting for national liberation fought heroically. Under the leadership of the fighting Albanian Communist Party, the hungry and cold people, with the example of the Soviet Union and the example of our people's savior—the great Stalin—engraved in every heart. These people did not spare their lives in the righteous battle, they did not lay down their arms, nor did they give these hateful fascist bandits a moment's respite. They fought and sacrificed for the happiness of their people. All eyes were focused on the red star of the Kremlin—the beacon of the liberation of all mankind from the shackles of fascism.

The film "New Albania" truthfully depicts the history of our people. The imperialist elements had divided our country, and Albania's feudal lords and capitalists—the lackeys bought by imperialism—had cruelly exploited our people. However, all the enemies of the Albanian people, whether with hunger, flogging, or shooting, could not enslave our people. Our people have been waiting for this day, the day when the people settle accounts with their enslavers has arrived.

The struggle and victory of the weak Albanian people are closely linked to the glorious struggle and victory of the Soviet nationalities and the heroic Soviet army. Without the Soviet Union, without the genius Stalin, our people would never see the light of freedom, would never be able to live independently and autonomously, and would never be able to seize power and establish a new Albania.

Since the Hitler bandits barbarously invaded the Soviet Union, when the Soviet nationalities fought for the independence and freedom of their motherland, they showed the world a model of their patriotism. The Albanian Communist Party—the leader of our working people—has been established. Our Party has effectively completed its task, because it follows the great and all-conquering doctrine of Marxism-Leninism, and it always pursues the example of the glorious Bolshevik Party—the party of Lenin and Stalin.

In the film "New Albania," our mountains, basins, and peasant villages are displayed; our city streets and houses are displayed; places worthy of our collective memory are displayed, where the heroes of our people sacrificed themselves. Our small nation, in the great test of the anti-fascist struggle, never felt that it was an isolated force. Mountains and basins separated us from Moscow, from the heroic city of Stalingrad and the city of Lenin. But they all existed in our hearts, they were our strength, our hope, and our faith. The film "New Albania" clearly reflects the very important and historically significant facts of the victory of our people, which gave our people great power to overcome the enemy, and these facts are still inspiring and supporting our new people of Albania to advance rapidly along the road of socialist construction. When the Soviet army liberated Yugoslavia, it was also the moment when our people defeated fascism. We should thank the Soviet army for the comprehensive victory. After the victory, our people regained consciousness, and they breathed freely on their own land as if they were masters with full power. The people's democratic regime has been established, and a new life has begun. The film "New Albania" depicts the life of Albania with all its strength and beautiful scenes. Our people have endured many sufferings brought about by the war, but this has not weakened their perseverance. Our old mother crawls on the remains of her heroically sacrificed son and affectionately strokes the land that buried her son. It was these mothers who personally handed pistols and bullets to their children and told them, "Don't come home until you win!"

One of the most valuable instructions of our sacrificed heroes is that we should protect and consolidate the friendship with the Soviet people as if we were protecting our own eyes. This feeling has been injected into the blood of every simple person in the new people's Albania, and it has been injected into the blood of the whole people.

There is a saying in our people's folk songs: "After the storm, the sky clears." This is what Albania is like; after the war, we began to rebuild our country, mobilizing the whole people to restore everything that was destroyed. Golden waves of wheat grew again in the fields, and in the peasant houses that had broken the feudal shackles and acquired their own land, a new and happy life began. Factories and power plants that had been destroyed have now been restored. The workers became the masters of the factories and mines, which were exploited by foreigners in the past. Today, we produce oil—black gold—not for foreign capitalists, but for our people. Today, we produce copper, chromium ore, and asphalt for our motherland and not for our enemies. We are rebuilding houses burned down by the enemy, building roads and railways, opening and expanding schools, and promoting drama, music, and sports.

Our country is moving forward, and our people who have experienced many disasters are simple, loyal, kind, and brave people: they are not afraid of the enemy, whether it is big or small, and are prepared to resist to the end. Our people always believe in their friends, and they never betray them. For many years, our people have unswervingly maintained this noble quality, and they have fought to defend their honor, their motherland, their borders, customs, habits, and folk songs. This is what is precious to our people. Therefore, the Albanians work with songs in their prosperous new Albanian homeland. From the first day of our liberation, the Soviet Union has shown brotherly help to the Albanian people. The consolidation of our economy depends entirely on this generous help. In our fields, the Soviet tractors from the glorious Stalingrad Tractor Plant are cultivating the land, and our peasants are singing the glory of the heroes of Stalingrad and Stalin himself.

The film "New Albania" allows the Soviet people to further understand our people who are fighting, working, and building on the foothills of the Balkan Peninsula. This film is another important link in consolidating the brotherly friendship and respect between our nations. There is no force in the world that can defeat these simple Albanian people, who heartily cheer "Long live the great Soviet Union! Long live the great Stalin! Long live our life!" in the cause of peace and creation, and in guarding their victory, freedom, and independence.

The film "New Albania" gives progressive people all over the world the opportunity to correctly understand the Albanian people, and at the same time it will promote and strengthen the sympathy of progressive people for our peace-loving and freedom-loving people. It helps us expose the slander that we are aggressive in nature—this is the lie spread by the British and American imperialists and their lackeys—the Greek royalist fascists.

Our people want to live freely in the world, and they shed blood to achieve this goal. The era when the imperialist powers wanted to turn our country into a battlefield and squeeze the blood and sweat of our people has passed. The imperialist elements are still dreaming of the past, allowing them to exist as they did in the past. But our people will never be overcome by the oppression of imperialism or its lackeys—from the traitors from Tito to the traitorous Zodaris.

I sincerely thank the filmmakers of "New Albania" and wholeheartedly wish them new achievements in this creative work on behalf of all our people. I would also like to express my sincere gratitude on behalf of all the Albanian people to the Soviet government and the Soviet film company for their great attention and concern for the production of this extremely valuable film for our country.

　　谈“新阿尔巴尼亚”
    阿尔巴尼亚工人党总书记霍查著  李樵译
    阿尔巴尼亚人民有史以来，第一次有了自己的影片，这部影片真实地、清楚地描写出阿尔巴尼亚人民的过去和现在。这部优美的影片的演出，我们应当感谢友谊的苏联人民、苏联政府和伟大的斯大林。被派遣到我国来的荣膺斯大林奖金的摄影师依立亚·可波林，以异常的艺术技巧在银幕上写出了为数不多的爱自由的阿尔巴尼亚人民——坚定不移地捍卫着自己的独立与自由的阿尔巴尼亚人民底生活、情感和意志。
    只有苏联的艺术家和苏联的电影技巧能够在银幕上用这些简明又伟大的场面传达出我国人民纯朴的真实面貌。在“新阿尔巴尼亚”一片中，这些场面都展现在我们的面前了。为了要创造这部影片，那么就要爱我国的人民，了解我国人民的民族特点和他们灵魂深处的情感。“新阿尔巴尼亚”这部影片是世界劳动人民团结一致的原则底有力证明，伟大的列宁——斯大林的党，以这种精神去启发和教育苏联人民。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民以热狂的心情来欢迎这部影片，矿山上的矿工，工厂里的工人，农民，山地里的人们，和城市里的居民从这部影片里看到了阿尔巴尼亚人如何经过了这条为民族解放而斗争的困难的道路，看到了未来幸福生活底远景，在建设这种幸福的生活中我国人民正献出其全部力量。
    “新阿尔巴尼亚”一片是以一只翱翔着的雄鹰来做为开始的，这鹰——象征着我国人民的力量与自由。鹰安闲地飞翔在群山之巅。这些积满了雪的群山，几世纪以来一直就是我们祖先底、我们勇敢的人民底、不可征服的保垒。这些人民从不愿做奴隶，而的手持武器和残酷的敌人——帝国主义者——搏斗。这些山对我们来说是那么高贵无比，因为我们国家的任何敌人再也不能侵占这些山和在那儿建立起他们底野蛮的奴隶制度了。就是在这些山上和在这些高耸在断崖上的自然保垒的背后，在斯甘杰尔堡、戈姆底领导下，阿尔巴尼亚人进行了反对专制的君主斯坦布拉底斗争。二十五年后，在这群山的堡垒上，翻飞着不愿屈服在可憎恶的伊斯兰底绿旗面前的带有双头鹰的红色大旗。在这些山上我们的农民曾流着血同吸血鬼——封建主们做斗争。在这些山上，阿尔巴尼亚的爱国分子曾为反对意大利、匈牙利、奥地利、及希腊的企图奴役和分割我国的帝国主义分子进行过斗争。在这些山上，我们光辉的为民族解放而奋斗底游击队曾英勇地战斗过。在战斗的阿尔巴尼亚共产党的领导下，饥寒交迫的人们，每颗心田里都铭记着苏联的范例和我国人民的救星——伟大的斯大林的榜样。这些人们在正义的战斗中并没有吝惜自己的生命，他们没有放下武器，也没有让这可憎恶的法西斯匪徒们得到片刻的喘息。他们为自己人们底幸福去斗争，去牺牲。众目都注视着克林姆林宫的红星——全人类从法西斯底桎梏下解放出来的灯塔。
    “新阿尔巴尼亚”一片，以真实的事实写出了我国人民的历史，帝国主义分子曾分化我国，阿尔巴尼亚底封建主和资本家——帝国主义所收买的走狗——他们残酷地剥削过我国人民。但是，所有阿尔巴尼亚人民的敌人，用饥饿也好，鞭笞也好，枪杀也好都不能奴役我国人民了。我国人民已经等到了这一天，人民同自己的奴役者算总帐的一天已经到来了。
    弱小的阿尔巴尼亚人民底斗争和胜利，是与苏联各民族的光辉斗争和胜利，以及英勇的苏军紧紧地联系着的。没有苏联，没有天才的斯大林，我们人民将永远看不见自由之光，将永远不能独立自主地生存，净永远不能取得政权和建立新的阿尔巴尼亚。
    自从希特勒匪徒蛮横地侵入苏联以后，当苏联各民族为自己祖国底独立与自由而奋战时，向全世界表现出了他们爱国主义的楷模。阿尔巴尼亚的共产党——我国劳动人民的领导者——已经建立起来了。我们的党切实地完成了自己的任务，因为她遵循着伟大的战胜一切的马列主义的学说，她永远追逐着光辉的布尔什维克党——列宁、斯大林党的范例。
    在“新阿尔巴尼亚”一片中，展示出我国的山、盆地、农民的村舍；展示出我国城市里的街道、房屋；展示出值得我们大家记忆的地方，那儿是我们人民的英雄牺牲了的地方。我国这弱小民族在反法西斯斗争的伟大的考验当中，从没有感到自己是弧军一支的。山、盆地把我们和莫斯科，和英勇的斯大林城、列宁城分隔开。但是它们都存在在我们的心里，它们曾是我们的力量，我们的希望和我们的信念。“新阿尔巴尼亚”一片，清晰地反映出非常重要的具有历史意义的我国人民的胜利的事实，这些事实给予了我国人民去战胜敌人以莫大的威力，这些事实现在仍在鼓舞着，支持着我们新的人民的阿尔巴尼亚人民在沿着社会主义建设的道路上向前突飞猛进。当苏军解放南斯拉夫的时候，也正是我国人民战胜了法西斯的一刻。为了全面的胜利，我们是应当感谢苏军的。胜利之后，我国人民又重新得到了苏醒，他在自己的国土上如同握有全权的主人一般地自由呼吸了。人民的民主政权已经建立起来了，新的生活也开始了。“新阿尔巴尼亚”一片以全力和美好的场面描写出阿尔巴尼亚的生活。我国人民忍受了许多由战争所带来的苦难，但是这并没有削弱了他们的毅力。我们的年老的妈妈匍匐在自己的英勇牺牲了的儿子底遗骸上哭泣，并慈祥地抚摸着那块埋葬了她底儿子的土地。就是这些母亲们亲手把手枪、子弹交给了自己的儿女，并告诉他（她）们说：“不到取得胜利的时候别回乡！”
    我们已经牺牲了的英雄们底许多最宝贵的指示中之一就是——我们应当如同保护眼珠一样地保护并巩固同苏联人民的友谊。这种感情在新的人民的阿尔巴尼亚已经注入到每个直朴的人民的血液里，已经注入到全人民的血液里了。
    我国人民的民谣里有一句话：“暴风雨过去露晴天”，阿尔巴尼亚就是这样；战争过后，便开始重建我们的国家了，动员全民来恢复被破坏了的一切。在田野里又长起了金黄的麦浪，在已经击碎了封建枷锁的已取得了自己的土地底农舍中又开始过起崭新的、愉快的生活了。曾被破坏了的工厂、发电厂。现在又重新恢复起来了。工人成了工厂和矿山的主人了，这些工厂和矿山过去是外国人所开采的。今天我们出产石油——黑金——不是为外国的资本家，而是为了我国人民。今天我们出产铜、铭矿、沥青是为了我们祖国而不是为了我国的敌人。在我国重建起被敌人焚烧掉的房屋，建筑起公路和铁路，开办和扩大增设学校，倡导戏剧、音乐和运动。
    我们的国家正在前进着，我们这经历过许多灾难的人民是直朴、忠诚、善良而勇敢的人民：他不惧怕敌人，不管它是大的还是小的，并准备坚决地抵抗到底。我国人民是永远相信自己的朋友的，他亦从不背叛他们。多少年代以来，我国人民毫不动摇地保持着这种高贵的品质，他为保卫自己的名誉、自己的祖国、自己的边疆、风俗、习惯和民歌而斗争。这就是我国人民可宝贵的东西。因此阿尔巴尼亚人在自己繁荣的新阿尔巴尼亚国土上伴着歌声劳动着，从我国解放的第一天开始，苏联就对阿尔巴尼亚人民表现了兄弟般的帮助。我国经济的得以巩固，全赖这种慷慨的帮助。在我国的田园里是光荣的斯大林格勒的拖拉机制造场的苏联拖拉机在耕种着，我们的农民在歌颂着斯大林格勒的英雄们和斯大林本人的光荣。
    “新阿尔巴尼亚”一片，使苏联人民更进一步地认识正在巴尔干半岛底山麓边从事斗争、工作和建设的我国人民。这部影片又是巩固我们民族间兄弟友谊及爱敬底重要的环节。世界上没有任何力量能战胜这直朴的阿尔巴尼亚人民，他们在和平和创造的事业中，在警卫自己的胜利、自由及独立中衷心地欢呼着“伟大的苏联万岁！伟大的斯大林万岁！我们的生活万岁！”
    “新阿尔巴尼亚”一片给予了全世界进步的人们以正确地了解阿尔巴尼亚人民底机会，同时它将促进并加强进步的人们对我国爱好和平、爱好自由的人民底同情。帮助我们揭穿那些说我们是侵略性质的诽谤——这就是英、美帝国主义分子及其走狗——希腊保皇党法西斯所散布的谎言。
    我国人民愿意自由地生活在世界上，他们流血就是为达到这个目的。帝国主义列强想变我国为战场，榨取我国人民的血汗的时代已经过去了。帝国主义分子还在梦想着过去，允许他们和过去一样的存在。但是我国人民再不会为帝国主义或其走狗——从判徒从铁托直到卖国贼曹达里斯——们底压迫所战胜了。
    我真诚地感谢“新阿尔巴尼亚”这部影片的摄制者，并衷心地代表我国全体人民预祝他们在这富有创造性的工作中获得新的成就。我还要代表全体阿尔巴尼亚人民向苏联政府，和苏联电影公司致以衷心的谢意，因为他们非常注意和关心这部对我国极其贵重的影片的制作工作。（原文载一九四九年第三号火星杂志）
