More than 330 Party members from across the city attended. Ye Jianying, First Secretary of the CCP Central Committee South China Sub-bureau, and Fang Fang, Third Secretary, both attended. Ye Jianying rose to speak amidst thunderous applause. He first paid respects on behalf of the CCP Central Committee to all Party members in Guangzhou who had persisted in the underground struggle.

Subsequently, Fang Fang and Zhu Guang spoke separately on the issue of the open Party and the responsibilities of Party members in today's new situation.
