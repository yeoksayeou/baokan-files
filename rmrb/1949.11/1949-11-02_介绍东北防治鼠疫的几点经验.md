Editor's note: In order to rapidly and thoroughly eliminate the plague currently epidemic in Chahar, we have excerpted the experiences of plague prevention and control in Northeast China as a reference. As long as we properly absorb their valuable experiences and lessons, we will naturally avoid detours in our work and quickly complete the major task of eliminating the plague.

　　(1) Rat Catching, Rat Prevention, Flea Extermination, and Ovum Prevention
    Rats are the source of plague transmission, and fleas are the vector of plague transmission. Therefore, rat catching and flea extermination are the basic tasks of epidemic prevention. According to the work experience in Northeast China in 1948, plague did not occur or was limited to a very small number in areas where rat catching, flea extermination, and sanitation work were successful. Plague spread and expanded in areas where rat catching was delayed, sanitation work was poor, and a mass movement failed to form. This experience tells us that whether or not the plague can be eliminated mainly depends on whether we can inspire the masses, organize the masses, and form a conscious and widespread movement for rat catching, flea extermination, and sanitation.

    Rat catching must first conduct investigation and research on rodents: According to the work of the rat catching team in Northeast China, wild rats have the highest bacterial carrying rate and are the main source of plague transmission. The little gray rat migrates between rural and wild areas, and is the intermediate medium of rodent plague. The large gray rat often lives at home, and due to the transmission of the little gray rat, it has become an important threat to the plague transmission in cities and villages. Therefore, rat catching must be carried out step by step and with emphasis on these three enemies. "From inside to outside, from near to far." "Catching domestic rats first, then catching wild rats." Domestic rats should be caught before the spring thaw, and wild rats should be caught after the thaw.

    Rat catching should be regarded as a regular task, and the people should be encouraged to use various methods to carry it out. However, a movement must be formed in the spring and autumn to carry out a blitz. One rat in spring will breed hundreds of rats in autumn, so rat catching in spring is especially important. In particular, wild rat catching must be carried out in the spring and autumn, because the wild grass and field crops are lush in summer, covering the entrances of the burrows, making it difficult to catch; the ground is frozen in winter, making it impossible to carry out.

    After the occurrence of the plague, epidemic prevention personnel must assist the people in carrying out a blitz rat catching work, so that it is completely caught. After the outbreak of the epidemic, human-to-human transmission can be stopped by blockade and isolation, but rat-to-rat transmission cannot be blockaded and isolated. The spread of rodent plague poses a greater threat to humans than human-to-human transmission. In 1948, most of the families in Northeast China where plague occurred were scattered, and few had connected households or ten or more households. Tracing its transmission route, it is often impossible to find clues, but direct transmission of diseased rats is the main reason, which is obvious and clear.

    Rat catching must be combined with bacteria testing. If a bacterium-carrying rat is found in a certain area, it should be regarded as a warning area. Raising the awareness of the people in the area, strengthening rat catching, flea extermination, sanitation, and medical examinations, etc., will surely prevent the occurrence of the plague. In 1948, Ulanhot City in Inner Mongolia resolutely completed this work and prevented the occurrence of the plague. This experience pointed out the direction of future work for epidemic prevention personnel.

    Rats forage everywhere and are often active, especially the little gray rats are more active, so in addition to rat catching, rat prevention is also advisable. In 1948, all villages in Tongliao, Northeast China, dug rat-proof ditches, among which Yuliangbao achieved the greatest results. If rat-proof ditches can be dug well, regularly repaired, and equipped with floating bridges that are set up during the day and dismantled at night, so that there is no way to escape, and patrolling and capturing every morning, it can prevent rats from scurrying around inside and outside the village, and prevent the opportunity for domestic rats to communicate with wild rats, which is also an important factor in reducing plague transmission.

    Fleas are the vector of transmission, so flea extermination is also extremely important. The main way to exterminate fleas is to strengthen cleaning and sanitation work, and mobilize the masses to carry out burning, plastering walls, and plastering kangs, so that fleas have no place to hide and no opportunity to reproduce, and fleas are easily eliminated.

    According to the investigation in Northeast China in 1948, the source of transmission is mostly primary, or due to improper handling of dead rats without proper defense, being attacked by fleas, or being infected while working in the wild. Among the 5,649 bubonic plague patients this year, 3,871 had inguinal lymph nodes, accounting for more than 68%, which shows the importance of foot infection. Therefore, mobilizing the masses to wear long socks to prevent flea infestation is a method that should be widely promoted.

    In short, rat catching, rat prevention, flea extermination, and flea prevention must rely on the masses. Propaganda and education should be carried out repeatedly among the masses to make them understand the relationship between rats, fleas, and plague epidemics. Then use various methods of competition and rewards to form a blitz movement. Cultivating habits and carrying out consciously and regularly, the eradication of the plague is not difficult to achieve.

　　(2) Preventive Injections
    According to the experience of epidemic prevention in Northeast China in 1948, there are still many shortcomings in the work of preventive injections. For example, after receiving the vaccine, it is placed outdoors for a long time, exposed to wind and sun, reducing the effectiveness of the vaccine. The interval between the two injections is too long, so it cannot play its due role. The persuasion and education were not well done during the injection, so that the people escaped, and the required percentage could not be reached, etc. Despite this, preventive injections still achieved considerable results. According to a survey in Tongliao, Northeast China, among 1,587 patients, 56.7% had not been injected or had only been injected once, and 43.3% had been injected more than twice. Among 2,415 people surveyed by the mobile epidemic prevention station, 467 had not been completely injected, of which 31% were infected with plague; among 1,948 people who had been completely injected, only 12% were infected with plague. The mortality rate among 1,219 patients who were not completely injected in Tongliao and Kailu was 64.6%, and the mortality rate among 1,023 patients who were completely injected was 57.4%.

    The past experience in Northeast China compared the injection of live bacteria and dead bacteria, and found that the effectiveness of live bacteria is about three or four times greater than that of dead bacteria. And in villages and villages where epidemics occur, universal injection of live bacteria can prevent the continued spread of infection.

    The above achievements show that both live and dead bacteria have the effect of reducing infection rates, improving cure rates, and reducing mortality rates, and the effectiveness of live bacteria is especially great. Therefore, universal preventive injections should still be carried out in the future. However, before the injection, epidemic prevention personnel should contact administrative personnel, especially district and village cadres. The masses should be given prior publicity and education, and preventive injection work should be carried out in a planned and organized manner. According to the suggestion of Zhemeng in Northeast China, the injection personnel are divided into two groups. The first group departs early to inject, register and add tickets, but does not stamp them. The second group departs a week later to inject a second time on the same route. After completing the injection, stamp the injection ticket to take effect. This is a good method. Epidemic prevention personnel in various places should adopt it to avoid excessive intervals and prevent the expected effectiveness of preventive injections from being achieved. As for live bacteria vaccines, due to limited sources, they should be used with emphasis in areas with severe epidemics. Even after the epidemic occurs, injections should be given in the epidemic village and its neighboring villages. In order to achieve the effect of preventing the continued spread of the epidemic.

　　(3) Quarantine and Disinfection
    Quarantine should be thorough and disinfection should be strict. According to the review of epidemic prevention work in Northeast China in 1948, it is believed that there are shortcomings in both quarantine and disinfection work. The shortcoming of quarantine is that it cannot rely on the masses, go deep into the masses, grasp the situation of each household in the epidemic area, and discover patients early; the shortcoming of disinfection is that it only focuses on form and speed, and ignores strictness and thoroughness.

    When Ulanhot City in Inner Mongolia discovered that a certain area had bacterium-carrying rats, it immediately carried out quarantine and put forward the slogan of "internal line attack and external line defense," walking in front of the epidemic. When the mobile epidemic prevention station was working in Qianjiadian and Dalin District in Tongliao, it took the initiative to grasp the household registration and carry out quarantine before the epidemic occurred, and achieved good results. In the future, quarantine work must be carried out thoroughly under the policy of "finding bacterium-carrying rats in a certain place and regarding it as a warning area." After the epidemic occurs, it is more appropriate to grasp the household registration, understand the situation, go deep into the masses, rely on the masses, in order to achieve the purpose of not missing a household or a person. Before the outbreak of the epidemic, establish a plague prevention group, select a group leader for every ten households, mobilize women's federations and children's groups to check daily, and report any patients with acute illnesses. When bacterium-carrying rats have been found or an epidemic has occurred, epidemic prevention personnel should personally conduct medical examinations. Quarantine should be carried out at stations, transportation hubs, and ferries. People coming from epidemic areas should be strictly prohibited from entering the country or isolated or monitored appropriately according to the local situation.

    Disinfection work should be carried out strictly with petroleum emulsion or other drugs in each isolation circle. Not only should attention be paid to the patient's living room, but all items and houses in the isolation circle should not be missed, in order to achieve the dual effect of disinfection and flea extermination.

　　(4) Blockade, Isolation, and Treatment
    Due to the experience and lessons of the major epidemic in 1947, the masses and cadres in Northeast China have generally improved their understanding of the plague. By the time of epidemic prevention in 1948, the traffic blockade work had achieved considerable results. Taking the Zhemeng area as an example, primary plague in Tongliao and Kailu counties accounted for 80%, and only one case occurred in Naiman, Kulun, and Houqi, and it did not expand. Not only Zhemeng, but other places also achieved considerable results. However, there were also quite a few cases where family infections, neighborhood infections, and even spread to the entire village were caused by concealing patients, late reporting, and untimely isolation and blockade. The most serious ones were Kongjia Wobao in Tongliao and Mengjiatun in Kailu. It also happened that it spread from one village to another, or from one county to adjacent areas of neighboring counties, but the number was very small.

    In 1948, there were quite a few primary points of plague in Northeast China, and traffic was more frequent than in 1947, but because the blockade work was stricter, it prevented it from spreading further. Therefore, we should further raise the awareness of the masses and cadres of the importance of blockade work and strictly implement it. In addition to strengthening sentry posts, checking road passes, and strictly prohibiting traffic between epidemic villages and non-epidemic villages. It is more appropriate to strengthen the internal surveillance work in the village and absolutely prevent residents within the isolation circle from interacting with healthy people. Armed alert can be used when necessary. The greatest purpose of our epidemic prevention work is to completely eradicate the plague and prevent it from happening. If it does happen, if strict traffic blockade measures can be adopted to limit the infection to one or several points and prevent it from expanding into a surface, then the epidemic prevention work has been basically successful.

    In 1948, in order to take care of production, each epidemic village in Northeast China adopted the method of reducing the isolation circle, monitoring the villagers from scurrying around and going elsewhere, and allowing them to go to the ground for production. This method can improve the people's understanding of the plague; it can be adopted in places where the organization is strict.

    The isolation work in Northeast China in 1948 also achieved considerable results. According to Tongliao statistics, among 1,587 patients, 48.8% were isolated on the same day; 27.7% were isolated on the second day, and the two days combined accounted for more than three-quarters. This is mainly due to the general establishment of isolation centers in various villages, strengthening the reporting system, thorough quarantine, and the increased understanding of the plague by the masses and cadres. We should continue to work hard in these areas in the future in order to achieve the effect of early isolation.

    In order to save manpower and material resources and rationalize treatment, various places have adopted the establishment of healthy isolation centers in villages and villages to accommodate the families and neighbors of patients who have been in contact with them. District-level central isolation centers are set up to accommodate patients in the recovery period. County-level infectious disease hospitals are set up to accommodate acute patients for centralized treatment. This method has achieved considerable results. For example, the total cure rate of various plagues in Tongliao Infectious Disease Hospital was 65.96%, which was 25% higher than the treatment effect in other places in Zhemeng. It can be seen that centralized treatment and appropriate care should be adopted today when manpower and material resources are insufficient. However, when transporting patients, attention should be paid to covering them with more quilts to prevent them from catching cold, so as to avoid the danger of death on the way or death shortly after admission without treatment.

    Among the various tasks of infectious disease hospitals, organization, disinfection, and nursing should be regarded as the primary tasks. The treatment drugs are best based on sulfonamides, serum, and methylene blue combined therapy. However, in the absence of serum, the use of sulfonamides and methylene blue is also an effective treatment. Simple sulfonamide treatment, if taken early and administered in large quantities in the early stage, can also achieve a higher cure rate.

　　Conclusion
    Based on the experience of epidemic prevention work in Northeast China in 1948, we can believe that if the Party, government, army, and people can truly work hard in the future, improve the grassroots organization, carry out universal and effective publicity and education, mobilize the masses, organize the masses, rely on the masses, strengthen rat catching, flea extermination, preventive injections, quarantine and disinfection, blockade and isolation, and treatment and other epidemic prevention and life-saving work, it can be done to quickly eliminate the plague, and reduce deaths and increase cure rates.

　　介绍东北防治鼠疫的几点经验
    编者注：为了目前我们要迅速彻底的扑灭察北正在流行的鼠疫，特把东北防治鼠疫的经验，节录出来，作为我们的借镜。只要我们好好的吸取他们宝贵的经验教训，在工作中自然不会多走弯路，并且能很迅速的完成我们扑灭鼠疫的重大任务。
　　（一）捕鼠、防鼠、灭蚤、防蛋
    鼠为鼠疫的传染根源，蚤为鼠疫的传染媒介；所以捕鼠灭蚤为防疫的基本工作。根据东北四八年的工作经验，捕鼠，灭蚤，清洁卫生工作有成绩的地方，鼠疫即未发生或发生限于极少数目。捕鼠较晚，清洁卫生工作较差，且未能形成群众性运动的地方，鼠疫即扩大蔓延。这个经验告诉我们，是否能消灭鼠疫，主要在于是否能启发群众，组织群众；形成自觉的、广泛的捕鼠、灭蚤、清洁卫生运动。
    捕鼠必先对鼠类进行调查研究：根据东北捕鼠队工作证明，野鼠保菌率最高，是鼠疫传染的主要根源。小灰鼠在乡村、野外两地移居，是鼠类鼠疫的中间媒介。大灰鼠经常家居，由于小灰鼠之传染，成为城市和村中，鼠疫传染的重要威胁。所以捕鼠必须向这三个敌人有步骤，有重点的进行。“由里向外，由近及远。”“先捕家鼠，后捕野鼠。”在春天化冻前要捕家鼠，在化冻后要捕野鼠。
    捕鼠工作应视为经常工作，鼓励老百姓，利用种种方法进行。但在春秋两季必须形成运动，进行突击。春天一只鼠秋后繁殖百只鼠，所以春天捕鼠是特别重要的。尤其是捕野鼠必须在春秋两季进行，因夏日野草及田禾繁茂，掩闭洞口，不易捕捉；冬日地冻，更不能进行。
    在发生鼠疫后，必须由防疫人员协助老百姓进行突击捕鼠工作，务使彻底捕净为止。在疫情发生后，人传人可以封锁隔离制止，鼠传鼠则不能封锁隔离。鼠类鼠疫扩大，对人之威胁有甚于人传人。四八年东北各村鼠疫发生之家，多系散在的，而少有接联数户或十数户发生者。追其传染经路，又常无线索可寻，但病鼠直接传染，为其主要原因，是已昭彰显明的。
    捕鼠必须与检菌相结合。某地发现保菌鼠，即应视为警戒区。提高该区老百姓警觉性，加强捕鼠、灭蚤、清洁卫生和检诊等工作，一定可以防止鼠疫的发生。四八年内蒙乌兰浩特市因坚决的完成了这一工作，防止了鼠疫的发生，这个经验，给防疫人员，指明了今后工作的方向。
    鼠类各处寻食，经常活动，尤以小灰鼠的活动范围更大，所以除掉捕鼠而外，亦宜防鼠。四八年东北通辽各村均挖防鼠沟，其中以余粮堡收获为最大。如能挖好防鼠沟，经常修整，装置日设夜拆的浮桥，不使有逃逸之路，每日清晨巡逻捕捉，则可防免鼠类村里村外乱串，杜绝家鼠与野鼠交往机会，也是减少鼠疫传染的一个重要因素。
    跳蚤为传染媒介，所以灭蚤亦极重要。灭蚤主要是加强清扫卫生工作，发动群众进行烧燎，抹墙，抹炕，使蚤类无藏匿之所，无繁殖的机会，蚤类自易消灭。
    根据东北四八年的调查，传染根源多为原发，或因处理死鼠，未作适当防御，受蚤类之侵袭，或在野外工作，遭受传染。本年五千六百四十九名腺鼠疫患者中鼠蹊腺为三千八百七十一名，占６８％强，可见足部传染之重要。因此发动群众，穿长统袜子，以防跳蚤之侵害；这种办法是应广泛推行的。
    总之捕鼠防鼠，灭蚤防蚤，必须依靠群众。应在群众中间，反复进行宣传教育，使其了解鼠、蚤和鼠疫流行之关系。再利用竞赛奖励种种方法，形成突击运动。养成习惯，自觉的，经常进行则鼠疫的灭绝是不难实现的。
　　（二）预防注射
    根据东北四八年的防疫经验，预防注射工作中仍存有不少缺点。如领到疫苗后长期放置户外，风吹日晒，减低了疫苗的效力。注射时前后两次间隔时期过长，不能发生应有的作用。注射时未能很好说服教育，以致老百姓逃避，不能达到要求的百分率等。虽然如此，预防注射仍获得相当成绩。据东北通辽调查一千五百八十七名患者中，未注射或仅注射一次者占５６．７％，注射二次以上者占４３．３％，机动防疫站调查二千四百一十五人中，未受完全注射者四百六十七名，其中３１％感染鼠疫；受完全注射者一千九百四十八名中，却仅有１２％感染鼠疫。通辽、开鲁两地调查未完全注射之一千二百一十九名患者中死亡率为６４．６％，完全注射之一千○二十三名患者中死亡率为５７．４％。
    东北过去的经验以生菌及死菌比较注射，得知生菌效力较死菌约大三、四倍。且在疫情发生村屯，普遍注射生菌，可以防止传染继续流行。
    以上的成绩，说明生菌死菌均有减少感染率，提高治愈率，减低死亡率的效果，而以生菌的效力为尤大。因此今后仍应进行普遍预防注射。惟在注射之先，防疫人员应与行政人员，特别是区村干部取得联系。对群众则应事先进行宣传教育，有计划有组织的施行预防注射工作。根据东北哲盟的建议，把注射人员分为两组，第一组先期出发注射，登记添票，但不盖章，第二组在一星期后出发去同路线注射第二次，完成注射后，在注射票上盖章生效，这是很好的办法。各地防疫人员应予采用，以免间隔时期过长，不能收得预防注射应有之成效。至于生菌疫苗因来源有限，应在疫情严重地区有重点的使用。甚而在疫情发生后在疫村及其邻近村屯注射。以期收得阻止疫情继续蔓延之效。
　　（三）检疫和消毒
    检疫要彻底，消毒要严密。根据东北四八年的防疫工作检讨，认为检疫和　消毒工作中均有缺点。检疫的缺点在于不能依靠群众，深入群众，掌握疫区各户情况，早期发现病人；消毒的缺点，在于只重形式和速率，而忽视了严密和周到。
    内蒙乌兰浩特市在发现某区有保菌鼠时，即进行检疫并提出“内线进攻，外线防御”的口号，走在疫情前面。机动防疫站在通辽钱家店和大林区工作时，在未发生疫情之先，即主动的掌握户口，进行检疫，都收到了很好的成绩。今后检疫工作必须在某地“发现保菌鼠，即视为警戒区”的方针下，进行彻底检疫。在发生疫情后，更宜掌握户口，了解情况，深入群众，依靠群众，以期达到不漏一户，不漏一人的目的。在疫情未发生之先，建立防鼠疫小组，十户选一小组长，发动妇女会、儿童团，每日检查，发现急症患者，即行报告。在已发现保菌鼠或发生疫情时，由防疫人员亲自检诊。在车站，交通要道和渡口进行检疫，对疫区来人应严格禁止其入境或根据现地情况作适宜之隔离或监视。
    消毒工作应在每一隔离圈内用石油乳剂或其他药品严密施行。不只注意患者住室，凡隔离圈内一切物品房屋，均不应遗漏，以期兼收消毒灭蚤之实效。
　　（四）封锁，隔离，治疗
    由于四七年大流行的经验教训，东北的群众和干部对于鼠疫认识普遍的提高了一步，到四八年防疫时，交通封锁工作，有相当的收获。以哲盟地区来说，通辽、开鲁二县原发性的鼠疫占８０％，奈曼、库伦、后旗仅各发生一处，而未扩大。不只哲盟，其他各地亦有相当成绩。但因隐瞒病人，报告晚，不及时隔离封锁，造成家族传染，邻舍传染，甚而蔓延至全村者，亦相当的多。最严重的为通辽之孔家窝堡和开鲁之孟家屯。由一村传至他村，或由一县传至邻县的毗联区域者，亦曾发生，但为数极少。
    四八年东北鼠疫的原发点相当多，交通也较四七年更为频繁，惟因封锁工作较为严格，才防止了扩大蔓延至更远的地方。因此我们今后更当提高群众及干部认识封锁工作的重要性，严格执行。除加强站岗放哨，检查路条，严禁疫村与非疫村往来外。更宜加强村内监视工作，绝对防止隔离圈内居民与健康人家往来。必要时可利用武装警戒。我们防疫工作的最大目的是彻底根绝鼠疫，使之不发生，如一旦发生，如能采用严封交通办法，使传染限于一点或数点，不使扩大成面，则防疫工作即已基本成功了。
    东北四八年为了照顾生产，各疫村曾采用缩小隔离圈，监视村人乱串及他往，允许下地生产的办法。这个办法可使老百姓对鼠疫的认识提高；组织严密的地方，是可以采用的。
    东北四八年隔离工作，亦有相当收获，据通辽统计一千五百八十七名患者中，在当日隔离者占４８．８％；第二日隔离者占２７．７％，两日综合占四分之三强。这主要应归功于各村普遍成立隔离所，加强报告制度，彻底检疫和群众及干部对鼠疫认识提高的结果。今后仍应向这些方面努力，以期达到早日隔离之效。
    为了节省人力物力，合理治疗，各地多采用村屯设立健康隔离所，收容接触患者的家族及邻人。区设中心隔离所，收容恢复期患者县设一、二传染病院，收容急期患者集中治疗。这个办法是得到了相当收获的。如通辽传染医院，各种鼠疫的总治愈率为６５．９６％，较哲盟其他各处治疗效果提高２５％。可见集中治疗，适宜护理，在今日人力物力不足的时候，是应当采用的。但在轮送病人的时候，应注意多盖被，不使受凉，以免中途死亡或在入院后不久未经治疗即行死亡的危险。
    传染医院各种工作中，应以组织、消毒、护理工作视为首要工作。治疗药品则以磺胺，血清及美蓝混合疗法为佳。但在不能获得血清之情况下，采用磺胺及美蓝亦为有效疗法。单纯磺胺治疗，如早期服用并在初期即大量投与，亦可获得较高的治愈率。
　　结语
    根据东北四八年的防疫工作经验，我们可以相信今后党政军民如能真正努力，把基层组织健全起来，进行普遍而又有效的宣传教育，发动群众，组织群众，依靠群众，加强捕鼠灭蚤，预防注射，检疫消毒，封锁隔离，和治疗等等防疫保命工作，是可以作到，迅速扑灭鼠疫，并可减少死亡，提高治愈率的。
