　　On the Elimination of the Antagonism Between City and Countryside
    By Kurobatkin Translated by Zhang Zhenhuan
    "Pravda" answers readers Kazakov (Gorky City) and Chaitvierkov (Latvian Republic): What is the antagonism between city and countryside? What are the methods for its elimination?

    The antagonism between city and countryside is one of the earliest and most profound contradictions in class-antagonistic societies, especially capitalist societies.

    The antagonism between city and countryside, which arises in the process of the growth of the social division of labor, the development of the private ownership system of the means of production, and the social separation of exploiting and exploited classes, is constantly strengthening and has reached its most acute point in the capitalist era.

    Due to the establishment of the capitalist system, the countryside is subject to the rule of capitalist cities and the rule of big capital. Capitalism concentrates its main wealth in cities: means of production, science, technology, and art; while the countryside in the capitalist era is extremely backward in productive forces, devoid of culture, and its residents are isolated and separated. The drastic increase in the exploitation of the rural working masses has created serious obstacles to the development of agricultural productivity.

    As capitalism develops, especially in the era of imperialism, the economic and cultural gap between city and countryside deepens further. The United States is a most striking example. The plunderers of monopoly capital ruthlessly destroy and plunder the laboring peasants, drive them from the land, and subject them to hunger, poverty, and ignorance. Millions of farmers flee to the cities, swelling the ranks of the unemployed. In 1947, even according to official materials, as many as three million farmers, that is, half of the total number of American farmers, did not have the minimum means of subsistence.

    In order to create the conditions for eliminating the antagonism between city and countryside, it is first necessary to complete the proletarian revolution, establish the dictatorship of the proletariat, thereby eliminating the capitalist system and the private ownership system of the means of production.

    Lenin instructed that only the proletarian revolution can liberate agriculture from the burden of private ownership and create the conditions for eliminating the antagonism between city and countryside.

    The Great October Revolution, in our country, was the beginning of eliminating the antagonism between city and countryside and the first and most important step. As a result of the socialist revolution, factories, banks, transportation, and land became the property of all the people, eliminating the hostile contradiction between city and countryside and creating the most important prerequisite for further consolidating the friendly alliance of workers and peasants under the leadership of the working class.

    The implementation of Lenin-Stalin's national industrialization, comprehensive agricultural collectivization, and the elimination of the rich peasant class on this basis are historical milestones in overcoming the antagonism between city and countryside.

    The successful realization of national industrialization guaranteed the establishment of the production technology base necessary for the socialist transformation of agriculture.

    Comrade Stalin pointed out in his speech at the conference of Marxist agriculturalists in December 1929 that with the development of the collective farm movement, "the relationship between city and countryside has been established on a new basis, and the antagonism between city and countryside will be eliminated at an accelerated pace."

    Life has fully proved Comrade Stalin's genius foresight. The greatest socialist reforms realized during the Stalin Five-Year Plans fundamentally overturned the antagonism between city and countryside in the Soviet Union.

    The victory of the collective farm system ended the previous backwardness of agriculture, opening up unlimited room for development for the progress of agriculture and for raising the material well-being and culture in our countryside.

    In the Soviet countryside, as in the cities, the exploiting classes and private property based on the means of production have been eliminated. Poverty is gone forever in the countryside. Agriculture is developing on the same type of socialist basis as industry, guaranteeing the accelerated overcoming of the antagonism between city and countryside.

    Comrade Stalin, in his report to the 17th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), summarized the great achievements in the material conditions of our laborers and emphasized that the countryside, like many of our cities and industrial centers, has fundamentally changed its face.

    "The contradiction between city and countryside is disappearing day by day. - Comrade Stalin instructed - The city is no longer a center of exploitation in the eyes of the peasants. The threads of economic and cultural integration between city and countryside are becoming increasingly stronger. Now, the countryside regularly receives all kinds of assistance from the city and its industry: tractors, agricultural machinery, automobiles, cadres, and funds, etc. Moreover, the countryside itself now has its own industry, such as agricultural machinery stations, repair shops, various manufacturing shops in collective farms, small power plants, etc. The gap in cultural level between city and countryside is being filled day by day." (Russian edition of Leninism Issues, page 458)

    Further strengthening the agricultural production technology base is the most important condition for eliminating the antagonism between city and countryside. In the Soviet Union, the level of socialist agricultural mechanization exceeds any capitalist country. Even before the war, there were 523,000 tractors and 182,000 combine harvesters working in the fields of the Soviet Union. The number of mechanized laborers exceeded three million. Agriculture in 1948 received more tractors, automobiles, and agricultural machinery from the government than in 1940 before the war.

    In terms of technology and scientific equipment, agriculture has greatly approached industrial production. Based on the mechanization of production and the consolidation and development of the socialist system, agricultural labor has become more and more like industrial labor.

    The widespread application of Michurin biology in agricultural production and the rational rotation system in accordance with scientific regulations have accelerated the progress of agricultural mechanization.

    The large-scale electrification of agriculture, implemented according to Comrade Stalin's initiative, is of great significance in the final elimination of the antagonism between city and countryside. At the beginning of 1949, more than 23,000 collective farms and more than 5,500 machine tractor stations had been electrified. Electrification has infinitely expanded the agricultural production base, promoted the comprehensive development of the socio-economy of state farms and collective farms, linked the culture and technology of the city with the broad masses of collective farm members, and completely changed the face of the countryside. The electrification of agriculture can start the huge movement of rural radio and cinema.

    To completely overcome the remnants of the antagonism between city and countryside requires a comprehensive improvement of the cultural level and political consciousness of the rural working masses.

    The Communist Party and the Soviet regime in the years of the Stalin Five-Year Plans strived to achieve a true cultural revolution in the countryside. Illiteracy was eliminated in the countryside, and primary universal compulsory education was implemented. Tens of thousands of collective farm members are studying in universities and industrial schools. The collective farm countryside now has about 150,000 rural clubs, rural reading rooms, and libraries, more than 4,000 district cultural palaces, tens of thousands of schools, cinemas, agricultural laboratories, and radio stations.

    Extensive residential construction is underway in the countryside. The face of our countryside is changing year by year. Many new villages have appeared, like cities with their well-equipped streets, well-built schools, clubs, hotels, hospitals, kindergartens, and nurseries, their sports fields, parks, and other cultural facilities.

    Implementing the appropriate allocation of productive forces, the socialist country has transformed the previously backward and poor rural areas into centers of economic development and culture. The widespread development of transportation and communication tools has closely connected the urban areas of national industry with the most remote rural areas.

    The laborers of the collective farm countryside, under the nurturing leadership of the working class, actively participate in the construction of a communist society, manage government work, and participate in the political and social life of the country.

    In the process of socialist construction, the Party has cultivated the excellent virtues of the collective farm members. A high sense of national interest and ardent Soviet patriotism have become the nature of the Soviet peasants. This essence was manifested with extraordinary force in the years of the Great Patriotic War and is manifested today in the large-scale socialist competition in the Soviet countryside. Due to brilliant labor, thousands of collective farm members have won the title of Hero of Socialist Labor. The collective farm peasants are engaged in a sustained struggle against anti-collective farm elements.

    An unprecedentedly enthusiastic yearning for learning and creative research on various departments has been shown in the countryside. Thousands of experienced collective farm members study the work of realizing and developing Michurin agricultural biology. Many advanced collective farm members give speeches, make reports, write books and papers. Countless intellectual cadres and highly accomplished laborers have emerged from the collective farm peasants, and their cultural level is no different from that of the industrial cadres of socialist countries.

    Under the leadership of the Communist Party, following the path indicated by Comrade Stalin, the great inspirer and organizer of the victory of the collective farm system, the Soviet countryside is increasingly raising to the level of socialist cities, both in terms of productive forces and the culture of its residents.

    In a communist society, the remnants of the antagonism between city and countryside will be completely eliminated. Comrade Stalin pointed out in his speech to voters on February 9, 1946, that the completion of the great program of communist construction, the realization of Stalin's plan to transform nature, and the achievement of abundant products and further prosperity of culture in the country will achieve the complete elimination of the antagonism between city and countryside.

　　论城市与乡村之间对立的消灭
    库罗巴特金作  张震寰译
    “真理报”答读者卡扎可夫（高尔基城）和柴特维尔可夫（拉脱维亚共和国）问：什么是城乡对立呢？它的消灭的方法是怎样的？
    城乡对立是阶级敌对的社会，特别是资本主义社会，最早和最深刻的矛盾之一。
    在劳动的社会分工的增长，生产手段私有制度的发展，剥削与被剥削阶级的社会分立等过程中发生出来的城乡对立，时刻在加强着，在资本主义时代达到了最尖锐化的地步。
    由于资本主义制度的确立，乡村服从于资本主义城市的统治，大资本的统治。资本主义在城市中集中了自己主要的财富：生产工具，科学，技术和艺术；而资本主义时代的乡村，却是生产力极端落后，无文化可言，居民是孤立而隔离的。对乡村劳动群众剥削剧烈的增加，给农业生产力的发展造成了严重的障碍。
    随着资本主义发展的程度，特别在帝国主义时代，城乡之间经济和文化的深渊更形加深了。美国便是一个最显著的例子。垄断资本的掠夺者残酷无情地破坏着掠夺着劳动农民，把他们从土地上赶出去，使他们遭受饥饿，穷困和愚昧的命运。千百万的农民逃到城市去，充实了失业的大军。在一九四七年，甚至于按照官方的材料，已达到了三百万农民，就是说美国农民总数的一半，没有最低限度的生活资料。
    为了造成消灭城乡对立的条件，首先必须完成无产阶级革命，建立无产阶级专政，从而消灭资本主义制度和生产手段的私有制度。
    列宁指示过，只有无产阶级革命能够把农业从私有制度的重担中解放出来，并造成城乡对立消灭的条件。
    伟大的十月革命，在我们国家内是消灭城乡对立的开端，是第一个最重要的步骤。由于社会主义革命的结果，工厂，银行，运输和土地变成全体人民的财产，消灭了城乡之间敌对的矛盾，并为进一步巩固以工人阶级为领导的工农友好联盟，创设了最重要的先决条件。
    列宁斯大林的国家工业化，农业全面集体化，和在这个基础上消灭富农阶级等政策的实现，是克服城乡对立的历史标志。
    国家工业化的圆满实现，保证了社会主义农业改造所必须的生产技术基础的建立。
    斯大林同志于一九二九年十二月在农业马克思主义者代表会议上的演讲中指示过，随着集体农庄运动的发展，“城乡关系已经建立在新的基础上，城乡对立将会加快速度消灭下去的”。
    生活充分地证明了斯大林同志的天才预见。在斯大林五年计划期间所实现的最伟大的社会主义改革，在苏联从根本上颠覆了城乡对立。
    集体农庄制度的胜利结束了先前的农业落后性，对于农业的进步，对于提高我们乡村中物质幸福和文化，开辟了无限的发展余地。
    在苏维埃的乡村中，和在城市里一样，肃清了剥削阶级和基于生产手段的私有财产。穷困在乡村中是一去不复返了。农业已同工业在同一类型的社会主义基础上发展着，保证了加速克服城乡对立。
    斯大林同志在联共（布）第十七次代表大会的报告中总结了我国劳动者的物质状况的巨大成就时，曾强调指出乡村同我们许多城市和工业中心一样地根本改变了面貌。
    “城乡矛盾日益消失下去。——斯大林同志指示说，——城市在农民心目中已不是剥削他们的中心了。城乡间的经济上文化上结合的线索日益坚固起来了。现在，乡村经常由城市及其工业方面得到种种帮助：拖拉机，农业机器，汽车，干部和经费等等。而且，乡村本身现在也有自己的工业，如农业机器站，修理场，集体农庄中的各种制造场，小型发电所等等。城乡间文化程度悬殊的深渊日益填平了”。（列宁主义问题俄文版，四五八页）
    更进一步加强农业生产技术基础是消除城乡对立最重要的条件。在苏联，社会主义的农业机械化水平超过了任何资本主义国家。还在战前就有五十二万三千部拖拉机和十八万二千部康拜因机在苏联的田地上工作。而机械化劳动工作者的数目超过了三百万。农业在一九四八年比战前一九四○年从政府方面获得更多的拖拉机，汽车和农业机器。
    按照技术和科学的装备来说，农业大大地接近了工业生产。在生产机械化，社会主义制度的巩固和发展的基础上，农业劳动更加变成工业劳动了。
    在农业生产中米邱林生物学的广泛应用，依照科学规定的合理的轮种制，加速了农业机械化的进行。
    依照斯大林同志的倡议所实现的农业大量电气化，在最后肃清城乡对立的过程中有重要的意义。一九四九年初，已经电气化的集体农庄超过二万三千个，机器拖拉机站超过五千五百个。电气化无限地扩大了农业生产基础，促进了国营农庄和集体农庄社会经济的全面发展，把城市的文化和技术与集体农庄庄员广大群众联系起来，彻底地改变了农村的面貌。农业的电气化，才能开始乡村无线电化和电影化的巨大运动。
    彻底克服城乡对立的残余，要求全面地提高乡村劳动群众的文化水平和政治自觉。
    共产党和苏维埃政权在斯大林五年计划的年代中努力做到了乡村的真正的文化革命。在乡村中肃清了文盲，实行了初级普及义务教育。数以万计的集体农庄庄员在大学和工业学校里学习。集体农庄的乡村现在大约有十五万个农村俱乐部，农村阅览室和图书馆，四千多个区文化宫，数万个学校，电影剧院，农业实验室，无线电台。
    在乡村进行着广泛的住宅建设。我们乡村的面貌逐年改变着。已经出现了许多新乡村，象城市一样有自己设备良好的街道，建筑得出色的学校，俱乐部，旅馆，医院，幼稚园和托儿所等建筑，自己的运动场，公园和其他文化设施。
    实行了生产力的适当配置，社会主义国家改变了以前落后的穷乡僻壤为经济发展和文化的中心。运输和联络工具的广泛发展，就把国家工业的城市区域同最远的乡村区域紧密地联系起来了。
    集体农庄乡村的劳动者在工人阶级领导作用培植之下，积极地参加共产主义社会的建设，管理政府工作，和国家之政治与社会的生活。
    在社会主义建设过程中，党培养了集体农庄庄员们优良的德性。高度的全国利益的观念，热诚的苏维埃的爱国主义已成为苏维埃农民的本性。这本质曾以非凡的力量，表现在伟大的卫国战争年代中，而今天则表现在苏维埃乡村中大规模的社会主义竞赛里。由于光辉的劳动，数千个集体农庄庄员获得了社会主义劳动英雄的称号。集体农庄的农民们进行着反对反集体农庄分子的持久斗争。
    在乡村中表现了对学习，对各部门工作创造性的研究前所未见的热烈向往。数千个有经验的集体农庄庄员，研究把米邱林农业生物学实现并发展的工作。有不少的先进的集体农庄庄员发表演说，做报告，著作书和论文。从集体农庄的农民中间产生了无数的知识分子干部和造诣高深的劳动工作者，他们按文化程度来说与社会主义国家的工业干部是没有区别的。
    在共产党领导之下，按照集体农庄制度伟大的鼓舞者和胜利的组织者斯大林同志指示的道路，苏维埃的乡村无论是生产力方面或是居民的文化方面，愈来愈提高到社会主义城市的水平。
    在共产主义社会中城乡对立的残余将完全消灭。斯大林同志在一九四六年二月九日在选民面前演说中已指出过，伟大的共产主义建设纲领的完成，斯大林改造自然计划的实现，以及国内丰饶的生产品的成就和文化更进一步的繁荣，将做到城乡对立的完全消灭。
