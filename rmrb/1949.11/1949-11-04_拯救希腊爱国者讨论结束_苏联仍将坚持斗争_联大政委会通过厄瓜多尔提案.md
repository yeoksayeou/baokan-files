Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 3rd: TASS, New York dispatch: The Political and Security Committee of the United Nations General Assembly concluded its discussion on the Soviet Union's proposal to save Greek patriots on the morning of October 27th.

During the discussion, representatives of the United States and Britain, who orchestrated the atrocities in Athens, dared not openly oppose the Soviet Union's righteous and stern proposals. They actively worked behind the scenes to obstruct the committee from adopting the Soviet proposal. Under pressure from the United States and Britain, the delegations of Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay, and Uruguay submitted proposals to the committee that essentially replaced the demand to overturn the executions of Greek democratic leaders with a series of general declarations. The representatives of Lebanon and Venezuela proposed to stop the discussion of the Soviet proposal, arguing that the committee had "no right" to consider it.

Representatives from Ukraine and Poland opposed the proposals from Lebanon and Venezuela. The head of the Soviet delegation, Vyshinsky, exposed the aim of this proposal as an attempt to cover up the Athens regime sheltered by the US-British bloc. He pointed out that raising the issue of the committee's jurisdiction when the discussion had been going on for three days and was practically near its end was absurd. The issue of the execution of Greek patriots was most closely and directly related to the report on the Greek issue submitted by the Mediation Committee to the Political Committee and the general situation in Greece. He further pointed out that the question of the committee's "lack of authority" was only raised to push aside the Soviet proposal, so that those who eagerly wished for the Greek patriots to be executed would not be forced to vote in favor of pardoning them.

The Lebanese representative's proposal was put to a roll-call vote at the insistence of the Soviet delegation. Due to the US-British majority supporting the Lebanese proposal, the committee passed it by a vote of thirty-one to sixteen, with twelve abstentions. In this way, the US-British majority in the Political Committee insidiously and shamefully avoided voting on the Soviet proposal. The delegations of the United States, Britain, France, and other delegations that obediently followed the United States, bear the full moral responsibility for their actions in inhumanely refusing to advocate for the Greek patriots. This decision by the US-British majority in the committee can only be seen as protection and encouragement of the bloody terror of Greek royalist fascists, a terror that was launched with the consent and at the request of the United States, which rules Greece as it rules its own colony.

On the morning of October 27th, the committee passed the Ecuadorian proposal. The proposal originally requested the committee to authorize the President of the General Assembly to negotiate with representatives of the Athens government in order to temporarily suspend the execution of death sentences pronounced by military tribunals for political issues during the mediation negotiations. However, before this proposal was put to a vote, the Ecuadorian representative, clearly under pressure from the United States, put forward an amendment to his proposal. This amendment greatly weakened the already imperfect proposal. The amendment stipulated that during the existence of the Mediation Committee, the President of the General Assembly should consult with the Athens government, not to delay the execution of death sentences, but "to find out the Greek government's views on the postponement of death sentences pronounced by military tribunals for political issues."

Vyshinsky opposed modifying the original text of the Ecuadorian proposal. He suggested that death sentences should not only be suspended but also cancelled, and that the provision regarding "suspension of execution during the existence of the Mediation Committee" should be removed from the Ecuadorian proposal. Furthermore, the President of the General Assembly should not be trying "to find out the views of the Greek government" but to negotiate with the Greek government to suspend and cancel the death sentences. To this end, Vyshinsky put forward corresponding amendments to the Ecuadorian proposal, but they were rejected by the US-British bloc using the voting machine.

Before the entire Ecuadorian proposal was put to a vote, Vyshinsky declared that the committee's rejection of the Soviet amendment had made the resolution even worse. Nevertheless, the Soviet delegation believed that even if the Ecuadorian proposal was weak and inadequate, it still represented the desire of the majority of the delegations to have the Greek government abolish the death sentences. Therefore, the Soviet delegation still voted in favor of the entire proposal. Thus, the Ecuadorian proposal was put to a vote and passed by a vote of forty to four (with ten abstentions).

After the vote, Vyshinsky made a brief speech stating that the Soviet delegation did not believe that the passage of the Ecuadorian proposal ended the struggle to end the terror and executions of Greek royalist fascists. The Soviet delegation will continue to fight to save Greek patriots and believes that the General Assembly will also join in this struggle.

### 拯救希腊爱国者讨论结束　苏联仍将坚持斗争  联大政委会通过厄瓜多尔提案

　　拯救希腊爱国者讨论结束
  　苏联仍将坚持斗争
    联大政委会通过厄瓜多尔提案
    【新华社北京三日电】塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会政治安全委员会于十月二十七日上午结束了苏联所提关于拯救希腊爱国者问题的讨论。
    在讨论中，策划雅典暴行的美英两国的代表，不敢公然反对苏联的义正词严的建议，便在幕后积极活动，来阻挠委员会通过苏联提案。在美英的压力之下，哥伦比亚、厄瓜多尔、巴拉圭、乌拉圭的代表团向委员会提出了建议，这些建议实质上是以一连串一般性的宣言，代替取消处决希腊民主领袖的要求的；黎巴嫩和委内瑞拉的代表，则提议停止讨论苏联的建议，认为委员会“无权”考虑它。
    乌克兰和波兰的代表反对黎巴嫩和委内瑞拉的建议。苏联代表团团长维辛斯基揭穿了这一建议的目的在于掩盖美英集团所庇护的雅典政权。他指出，当问题讨论了三天，实际上已近于结束的时候，才提出委员会的权限问题是荒诞的。希腊爱国者的处决问题，是和调解委员会提交政治委员会的希腊问题的报告和希腊一般形势问题，有最密切与最直接的关系的。他又指出：关于委员会“无权”的问题之提出，只是为了推开苏联的提案，以免那些亟欲希腊爱国者被处决的人们被迫投票赞成赦免他们。
    黎巴嫩代表的建议，在苏联代表团坚持之下举行了记名投票。由于美英多数方面赞成黎巴嫩的建议，委员会便以三十一票对十六票通过了它，有十二票弃权。这样，政治委员会中美英多数方面便阴险而可耻地避免了表决苏联的提案。美国、英国、法国的代表团，及其他驯顺地跟随着美国的各代表团，便因他们的这种行径而担负了不人道地拒绝为希腊爱国者声辩的全部道德责任。委员会中美英多数方面的这个决定，只能看作是对希腊保皇法西斯的血腥恐怖之保护与鼓励，这种恐怖是在美国同意和要求之下发动的，而美国正象统治自己的殖民地一样，在统治着希腊。
    十月二十七日上午，委员会通过了厄瓜多尔的提案。该提案原先是要求委员会授权联大主席，与雅典政府代表进行谈判，以求在调解的谈判期间暂缓执行因政治问题而为军事法庭宣告的死刑判决。但在这一提案提付表决之前，厄瓜多尔代表显然在美国压力之下，又提出了关于他的提案的修正案。这一修正案大大削弱了本来就不圆满的提案。修正案规定，在调解委员会存在期间，联大主席与雅典政府进行商谈，不是为了延迟死刑的执行，而是“找出希腊政府关于缓期执行因政治问题而为军事法庭宣告的死刑判决一事的观点”。
    维辛斯基反对修改厄瓜多尔提案的原文。他建议死刑判决不但要缓期执行而且要取消，并将关于“在调解委员会存在期间”缓期处决的这一规定自厄瓜多尔建议中撤除，而且，联大主席不是为“找出希腊政府的观点”，而是去和希腊政府进行商谈缓期执行和取消死刑的判决。为此，维辛斯基便对厄瓜多尔的提案提出了相应的修正案，但为美英集团使用表决机器否决了。
    在厄瓜多尔提案整个地表决以前，维辛斯基宣称：委员会否决了苏联之修正案，因之使决议案更形恶劣。虽然如此，苏联代表团以为：厄瓜多尔的提案即使是无力而不充分的，但仍代表大多数代表团欲使希腊政府取消死刑判决的愿望。因此，苏联代表团仍投票赞成整个的提案。于是，厄瓜多尔的提案便付诸表决，而以四十票对四票（有十票弃权）通过。
    表决终了之后，维辛斯基发表简短演说称：苏联代表团并不认为，厄瓜多尔的提案之通过就结束了为终止希腊保皇法西斯恐怖和处决而进行的斗争。苏联代表团为拯救希腊爱国者将继续进行斗争，并且相信联大也会加入在这一斗争中。
