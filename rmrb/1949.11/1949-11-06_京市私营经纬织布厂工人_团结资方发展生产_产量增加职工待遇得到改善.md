Beijing News: Workers at the Beijing Private Jingwei Weaving Factory are uniting with capitalists to restore and develop production. The factory currently has eighteen electric looms, thirty-four manual looms, six jacquard machines, and one raising machine. Before the War of Resistance, the factory had a maximum of 240 workers. During the war, it suffered from the economic squeeze of Japanese aggression, and production gradually declined. After the victory of the War of Resistance, it was devastated by the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, and production further decreased, eventually ceasing altogether.

In the early days of Beijing's liberation, the factory's shareholders, like most private factory owners, had doubts and a wait-and-see attitude. In early March, the Northwest Office placed an order with the factory, requesting 400 bolts of foreign cloth to be completed within half a month. According to the factory manager's estimate, it would take at least 20 days to complete, so he hesitated to accept the order. However, the workers took the initiative to find the manager and guarantee completion on schedule. The factory, with some skepticism, signed the contract with the office. The factory's union group immediately mobilized all the workers and recalled the female workers who had previously worked in the factory to start production. The eighteen electric looms, which had not been fully operational for several years, were all started. In order to meet the deadline, the workers also started three additional manual looms, and some workers even volunteered to work overtime after work. At the same time, the factory also adopted the workers' suggestion to implement a progressive wage system, which resulted in a rapid increase in output, with the highest being 4.23 bolts of cloth woven per person per day. Thanks to the efforts of all the workers, the task of 400 bolts of foreign cloth was completed in thirteen days, earning a net profit of 20 bundles of thread. Since then, with the assistance of the municipal state-owned trading company in processing and production and the active production of all the workers, the factory's output has increased month by month, from 670 bolts of cloth in March to 1,221 bolts in June.

In May of this year, the factory manager attended the municipal private capitalists' symposium and, after listening to Chen Yintang, manager of the private Dahua Pottery Company, report on the role of the factory affairs management committee, established a factory affairs management committee in the factory. Initially, it did not play a role due to lack of experience and unclear division of labor. In early August, at the suggestion of the union group, the heads of various departments were re-elected, and the system was improved so that the factory affairs management committee could play an active role in promoting production. In terms of production management, the following improvements were made: 1. Organizing seven idle workers in the factory to participate in winding shafts, saving the expenses of one worker. 2. The union group regularly held meetings to check the quality of finished products and discuss how to improve technical level so that the products could meet the standards set by the state-owned cotton yarn company. 3. Starting in September, more than seventy male and female workers in the factory were divided into day and night shifts to extend the production time of the machines. As a result, the output in September suddenly increased to 1,825 bolts of cloth, making the factory's profit 450,000 yuan in August and 470,000 yuan in September, turning the off-season into a peak season.

Under the principle of mutual benefit for labor and capital, the union group strove to improve employee benefits and welfare based on the factory's business situation and possible conditions. The factory was also willing to accept the reasonable demands of the workers due to the improved business. Currently, the wages of electric loom workers are calculated based on a standard output of 110 bolts per month, and have increased from 150 jin of millet to 207 jin. In terms of welfare, the factory bears the cost of medical treatment for employees' illnesses within 25 jin of millet, and the factory subsidizes half of the portion exceeding 25 jin. In addition, workers have a regular day off every half month. In addition, the union group has resolved the estrangement between workers and staff and strengthened employee unity through class education. On September 16, the factory formally established a union and summarized the work of the previous stage. In the future, the factory's workers will continue to unite and work hard with the capitalists under the leadership of the union to restore and develop production.

　　京市私营经纬织布厂工人
    团结资方发展生产
  　产量增加职工待遇得到改善
    【北京讯】京市私营经纬织布厂工人，团结资方恢复发展生产。该厂现有电力织布机十八台，人力织布机三十四台，提花机六台，起绒机一台。抗战前工人最多时曾达二百四十名，抗战中受日寇侵略经济的排挤，生产逐渐萎缩，抗战胜利后经国民党反动统治的摧残，该厂生产更趋减低，最后终于全部停工。
    北京解放初期，该厂股东与一般私营工厂厂主一样，存有疑虑和观望的态度。三月初，西北办事处曾向该厂订货，要求半月内完成四百匹洋布。据该厂经理估计最低要二十天才能完成，不敢接受，但工人们却主动的去找经理保证按期完成，厂方半信半疑的与该办事处签订了合同。该厂工会小组当即动员全体工人，并找回原来在该厂生产的女工开始生产。几年来从未全部开动过的十八台电力机，全数开动了。工人们为了赶期交货，另外又开了三台人力机，有的工人还在下班后自动加班；同时厂方也采纳了工人的建议，实行累进工资制，因之产量迅速提高，最高的每人每天织布四点二三匹。由于全体工人的努力，十三天即完成了四百匹洋布的任务，净赚线二十捆。此后，该厂在本市公营贸易公司加工生产的扶助和全体工人的积极生产下，产量逐月上升，三月份出布六百七十匹，六月份即增加到一千二百二十一匹。
    今年五月，该厂经理参加了本市私营资本家座谈会，听了私营大华窑业公司经理陈荫棠报告厂务管理委员会的作用后，即在该厂建立厂务管理委员会。初期因缺乏经验没有明确分工，不起作用；八月初经工会小组建议，又改选了各部门负责人，健全制度，使厂务管理委员会能起到积极推动生产的作用，在生产管理方面，曾作了以下的改进：一、组织厂内七个散闲工人参加打轴，节省了一个工人的开支。二、工会小组经常开会检查成品的质量，讨论怎样提高技术水平，使产品能合乎公营花纱布公司所规定的标准。三、自九月份起把全厂七十多个男女工人分为日夜两班，延长机器的生产时间，这样使九月份产量突增至一千八百二十五匹，使该厂八月份盈利四十五万元，九月份盈利四十七万元，把生产背月变成了旺月。
    工会小组在劳资两利的原则下，根据工厂的营业情形和可能条件，争取改善职工待遇和福利事业；厂方也因业务好转，愿意接受工人的合理要求。现该厂电力织布机工人工资，每月按一百一十匹的标准产量计算，已从一百五十斤小米增加到二百零七斤。在福利方面，职工疾病诊疗费在二十五斤小米以内的由厂方负担，超过二十五斤部分厂方津贴一半；工人每隔半月并有例假一次。此外，工会小组并通过阶级教育，解决了工人与职员隔阂，加强了职工团结。九月十六日该厂已正式成立工会，并总结了前一阶段的工作，今后该厂工人将在工会领导下，继续与资方团结努力，恢复发展生产。
