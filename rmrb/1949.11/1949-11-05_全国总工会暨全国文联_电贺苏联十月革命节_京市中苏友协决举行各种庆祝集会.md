The All-China Federation of Trade Unions and All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles
	Send Telegrams Congratulating the Soviet October Revolution Day
	Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Decides to Hold Various Celebration Gatherings
[Report from this newspaper] The 32nd anniversary of the Soviet October Revolution is approaching. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles have sent telegrams of congratulations. The full text of the two telegrams is as follows: To Comrade Kuznetsov, Chairman of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, and to all Soviet class brothers!
	On the occasion of the great festival of the 32nd anniversary of the Soviet October Revolution, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, on behalf of the Chinese working class, extends warm congratulations to you.
	Since the October Revolution, after the Soviet working class established a socialist country on one-sixth of the world's land, the world's labor movement has entered a new historical stage and opened a new era in human history. Under the leadership of the great leaders and teachers of the world's working class—Comrades Lenin and Stalin—the Soviet working class has victoriously completed and is completing the five-year plans for socialist construction one after another, thoroughly defeating the German, Italian, and Japanese fascist bandits, making the Soviet Union a paradise for mankind without class and national oppression and exploitation, and a fortress for the world to defend people's democracy and lasting peace, pointing out a bright path for the oppressed classes and oppressed nations of the world. The great victory of the Chinese people's revolution today is inseparable from the victory of the Soviet October Revolution and the victory of the Soviet Union in defeating German and Japanese fascism. Without the two great victories won by the Soviet working class under the heroic struggle of the great Lenin and Stalin, the victory of the Chinese revolution would have been impossible. The great victory of the Soviet working class has not only boosted our confidence but also given us tremendous help. In the great cause of building a new China in the future, we can only learn from the Soviet Union's various construction experiences and get greater help from your Soviet working class to successfully achieve the goal of building an independent, free, peaceful, unified, prosperous, and strong new China. Taking this opportunity of the great 32nd anniversary of the October Revolution, on behalf of the working class of China, I would like to express my sincere gratitude and respect to your Soviet working class and to Comrade Stalin, the great teacher of the world's working class!
		All-China Federation of Trade Unions, November 3
    To Comrade Fadeyev, dear friends, and all Soviet literary and artistic workers and all Soviet people:
    Thirty-two years ago, the heroic Soviet people, under the leadership of the great Lenin and Stalin, defeated the internal and external counter-revolutionary enemies and created the first society without class oppression on Earth. In the past thirty-two years, you have completed the construction of socialism with unparalleled hard work, perseverance, and wisdom, making the light of Soviet culture shine in every corner of the world; you have defeated the vicious fascist Germany and Japan with unprecedented heroism and strength, defended the socialist motherland, and saved hundreds of millions of people in the three continents of Europe, Asia, and Africa from fascist enslavement and threat. For thirty-two years, every victory and success of yours has provided the best conditions for the bright future of mankind.
    Before mankind, there are now two paths: one is the imperialist path that leads mankind to war, enslavement, and death; the other is the socialist path that leads mankind to peace, freedom, and prosperity.
    Under imperialist rule, there is mutual discrimination among nations, double exploitation of oppressed nations, war hysteria, cultural degeneration, economic panic, the threat of unemployment, the poverty and hunger of the vast majority of people, and the greed and licentiousness of a few wealthy classes.
    Under the socialist system, the opposite is true. Here, there is unity and friendship among all ethnic groups, economic prosperity, developed culture, everyone has the right and obligation to work, everyone has the opportunity and guarantee to study, entertain, and recuperate; everyone can contribute their wisdom and strength for common happiness and strive for new inventions and creations. This is the ideal that mankind has pursued since ancient times, and it is the path pointed out to us by the great prophet Marx, which has been realized by the great Lenin and Stalin with their outstanding leadership skills!
    The imperialist aggressive bloc is now making a desperate struggle to save its inevitable demise, and is frantically attacking the peace-loving and democratic people of the world; it harbors a beast-like hatred for the Soviet Union. However, the people of the world understand that the Soviet Union, which has undergone thirty-two years of the most arduous tests and achieved great victories and successes, is the bulwark of world peace and democracy. The strength and prosperity of the Soviet Union is a clear proof of the inevitable decline of imperialism and a guarantee that mankind will eventually achieve complete liberation.
    We Chinese people have gone through decades of revolutionary struggle, and it was not until the success of the Soviet October Revolution that we got the best teacher. Our long and painful experience tells us that we must take the Soviet path to win. And the Soviet Union has never ceased to give us assistance. The Soviet Union is the most reliable friend of the Chinese revolution. The Chinese people express their infinite respect and gratitude for the Soviet Union's lofty internationalist spirit.
    The recent visit of the Soviet cultural, artistic, and scientific delegation led by Comrade Fadeyev has given us great encouragement. Since the October Revolution, the theory and practice of Soviet literature and art have had an immeasurable impact on literary and artistic workers all over the world. In particular, our Chinese revolutionary literary and artistic movement has not only absorbed nourishment from Soviet literature and art but also learned lessons from Soviet literature and art. The decadent bourgeois literature and art of imperialist countries are now declining day by day, while the Soviet literature and art of socialist realism, with its brilliant radiance, has become the greatest comfort and encouragement for the world's human beings in their liberation struggle.
    On the occasion of the great 32nd anniversary of the October Revolution, we, on behalf of the Chinese literary and art workers, extend our sincere congratulations to the heroic and hard-working Soviet people and our sincere respect to the outstanding creators of Soviet literature and art.
    Long live the great Soviet people!
    Long live the teacher of mankind, the great Stalin! All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles

　　全国总工会暨全国文联
  　电贺苏联十月革命节
    京市中苏友协决举行各种庆祝集会
    【本报讯】苏联十月革命三十二周年纪念即届，全国总工会既全国文联特驰电祝贺。两电全文如下：苏联总工会主席库兹涅佐夫同志转全苏联的阶级弟兄们！
    欣逢苏联十月革命三十二周年纪念的伟大节日，中华全国总工会谨代表中国工人阶级向您们致热烈的祝贺。
    自从十月革命苏联的工人阶级在世界六分之一的土地上创立了社会主义国家之后，全世界的工人运动就进入了一个崭新的历史阶段，开创了人类历史的新纪元。苏联的工人阶级在伟大的全世界工人阶级的领袖与导师——列宁、斯大林同志的领导之下胜利地一个接着一个地完成了并正在完成着社会主义建设的五年计划，彻底地打败了德、意、日法西斯匪帮，使苏联成了全世界没有阶级与民族的压迫和剥削的人类乐园，成了全世界保卫人民民主与持久和平的堡垒，给全世界被压迫阶级与被压迫民族指出了一条光明的大道。中国工人阶级今天所获得的人民革命的伟大胜利，与苏联十月革命的胜利，与苏联战胜德、日法西斯的胜利是分不开的。没有苏联工人阶级在伟大的列宁、斯大林领导下英勇奋斗所获得的两次伟大胜利，中国革命的胜利是不可能的。苏联工人阶级的伟大胜利，不仅鼓舞了我们的信心，而且给了我们莫大的帮助。我们在今后建设新中国的伟大事业中，更只有好好地学习苏联的各种建设经验，得到您们苏联工人阶级更大的帮助，才能够胜利的达成建立一个独立、自由、和平统一与富强的新中国的目的。乘此伟大的十月革命三十二周年纪念节日的机会，代表全中国的工人阶级向您们苏联工人阶级向全世界工人阶级的伟大导师斯大林同志表示真诚的感谢和敬意！
　　中华全国总工会　十一月三日
    苏联作家协会亲爱的法捷耶夫同志和全苏联文学艺术工作者及全体苏联人民：
    三十二年前，英勇的苏联人民在伟大的列宁和斯大林领导下，战胜了内外反革命敌人，在地球上创造了第一个没有阶级压迫的社会。在三十二年中，你们曾以无比的辛劳、毅力与智慧，完成了社会主义的建设，使苏维埃文化的光芒照耀着全世界的每一角落；你们曾以史无前例的英勇和坚强击败了凶恶的法西斯德国和日本，保卫了社会主义祖国，使欧亚非三洲在法西斯奴役与威胁下的亿万人民得到了拯救。三十二年来，你们每一胜利与成功，都给人类的光明前途提供了最好的条件。
    人类面前，现在摆着两条道路：一条是引导人类走向战争、奴役与死灭的帝国主义道路；另一条是引导人类走向和平、自由与繁荣的社会主义道路。
    在帝国主义统治下面，呈现着各民族间的互相岐视，被压迫民族的双重剥削，战争的歇斯底里，文化的堕落，经济的恐慌，失业的威胁，广大人民的贫困与饥饿，少数富有阶层的贪婪与荒淫。
    在社会主义制度下面，则恰恰相反。这里各个民族间充满着团结友爱，经济繁荣，文化发达，人人有劳动的权利与义务，人人有学习、娱乐、休养的机会与保障；人人都能为共同的幸福而贡献自己的智慧与力量，努力于新的发明与创造。这是从古以来人类所追求的理想，也正是伟大的先知马克思所指给我们的道路，而为伟大的列宁和斯大林以卓越的领导才能所实现了！
    帝国主义侵略集团为了挽救其不可避免的灭亡，现在正作绝望的挣扎，疯狂地进攻全世界的爱和平与民主的人民；对于苏联，抱着野兽般的仇恨。然而全世界人民都明白，经历了三十二年最艰苦的考验而获得伟大胜利与成功的苏联，它是世界和平与民主的保垒，苏联的强大与繁荣是帝国主义必然没落的明证，是人类终将获得全部解放的保障。
    我们中国人民经历了几十年的革命斗争，直到苏联十月革命成功，才得到了最好的老师。我们长期的苦痛经验告诉我们：必须走苏联的路才能胜利。而苏联也从未间断地给我们以援助。苏联是中国革命最可靠的朋友。中国人民对于苏联的崇高的国际主义的精神，表示无限的尊敬与感谢。
    最近法捷耶夫同志为首的苏联文化艺术科学工作者代表团的访问，尤其给了我们极大鼓舞。十月革命以来，苏联文艺的理论与实践，对于全世界的文艺工作者曾发生了不可衡量的影响。特别是我们中国的革命文艺运动，既从苏联文艺吸取了滋养，也从苏联文艺取得了教训。帝国主义国家的资产阶级的颓废主义的文学艺术现在是一天一天走向没落，而光辉万丈的社会主义现实主义的苏联文艺成为世界人类在解放斗争中的最大安慰与鼓励。
    际此伟大的十月革命三十二周年纪念的日子，我们代表中国的文艺工作者特向英勇而勤劳的苏联人民致衷诚的祝贺，向苏维埃文艺的优秀的创造者们致诚挚的敬意。
    伟大的苏联人民万岁！
    人类导师、伟大的斯大林万岁！中华全国文学艺术界联合会
