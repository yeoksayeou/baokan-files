    Some Experiences in Teaching at Cadre Middle Schools
    Wang Changlong
    In order to adapt to the development of the revolutionary situation, a large number of village cadres are to be promoted to district cadres. However, they were all poor peasants in the past and have no education. Therefore, improving their education has become an important issue in improving district and village cadres. The Jiaozuo Cadre Middle School was established for these purposes.
    The students of Jiaozuo Cadre Middle School are generally young and middle-aged village cadres who have undergone mass movements, have a certain foundation of class consciousness, and are ideologically pure. Our purpose in educating these students is to: improve their education, improve their political level, strengthen their concept of serving the people, and cultivate them into cadres with the general conditions of district cadres. Although most of these students are illiterate when they enter the school, we must not treat them the same as elementary school students in terms of teaching and management, let alone the same as ordinary middle school students.
    (1) Cultural Learning: When learning new characters, start with those that are needed and used in daily life, or those that are commonly seen and heard, starting with characters with fewer strokes, and then gradually learning characters with more strokes. However, these students are different from children in that they have a very high ability to understand. For example, if you teach him the character "人" (rén, person), he will guess that the "任" (rèn) in a surname is also this "人". This should be paid attention to in teaching. Do not teach several homophones for one character at first, which will affect the planned learning plan and progress; at the same time, it is not easy for students to remember.
    Due to the students' enthusiasm for learning and eagerness to achieve success, they ask to explain the meanings of words more. However, the meanings of words must be explained in the same usage. For example, for the character "负" (fù, to bear), you can only explain the "负" in "负责任" (fù zérèn, to be responsible), "负担" (fùdān, burden), and "负债" (fùzhài, to be in debt). But if you explain the "负" in "辜负" (gūfù, to let down) and "胜负" (shèngfù, victory or defeat), it will cause confusion in their thinking and it will not be easy for them to accept. At the same time, students must learn characters in combination with words. Learning individual characters is easy to forget, and separating learning from application also affects the thorough understanding and application of word meanings.
    When learning words and sentences, and learning one or two hundred new characters, you can learn simple short articles. The selection of these short articles must be combined with ideological education and life guidance, and combined with the ideological development and requirements of everyone. In this way, not only should attention be paid to learning new characters, but also to repeatedly studying the general meaning of the lesson. Before class, the study group prepares collectively, and in class, students try to read and speak. After the teacher explains, the study group collectively studies the meaning of the lesson again and memorizes the meaning of the lesson during self-study time. Only in this way can the impression be deep, can it guide ideological action, and can the progress of cultural learning be fast.
    (2) Consolidate learning enthusiasm, improve class consciousness, and clarify the purpose of learning. This is the constant work for these students. If this work is not done well, the purpose of education and training cannot be achieved. Although the students have a strong desire to make progress, they all have family burdens, so they are often concerned about their families, which affects their learning enthusiasm. In order to consolidate learning enthusiasm, the village and district should take care of the students' families' production. In May of this year, the Qinyang County Party Committee and the district wrote a letter to the students in their county and district, telling them about the situation of wheat harvesting at home, which made the students who were asking for leave to go back feel at ease to study.
    The school should also summarize the learning results in a timely manner so that everyone can often see their own gains and the direction of their efforts. For example, student Yang Xiaolin, his family wrote to him several times urging him to go back to get married. He had already asked for leave, but when he was about to leave, after listening to the learning summary, he said: "I won't go back. If I go back for a few days, I will fall behind others. I will get married after I graduate from school..."
    Cadre middle schools are different from ordinary middle schools. There are many family visits. In our school with more than 200 students, there are often seven or eight or even more than ten family members coming to the school every day. When these family members come to the school, it is very necessary to have someone organize a discussion to introduce them to the learning situation of the school. In this way, the family members will not affect the students' learning due to family affairs.
    (3) In teaching management, we must trust everyone and promote democracy. Because these students are from rural areas, they are not accustomed to collective life, so it is difficult to establish the necessary learning system. Therefore, the provisions of the system must be passed by everyone, so that everyone understands what the provisions of the system are for. On the basis of consciousness, everyone should jointly formulate and abide by them. At the beginning, the school felt that everyone's life was loose and their consciousness was not high, so although the school had a system, it did not dare to let everyone master it. In this way, the system was announced in a mandatory manner. If the students did not abide by it, the teachers would criticize them. However, these announcements and criticisms did not work. Some students still went out of school to watch operas during self-study, and some even aroused complaints and emotions. Later, combined with the improvement of everyone's thinking, the learning system was discussed, and democracy was promoted. Everyone demanded more of themselves. In addition, group competitions were launched to encourage groups to supervise each other's learning, promote unity and friendship, and make everyone progress faster.

    干部中学教学的几点体会
    王昌隆
    为适应革命形势的发展，大批村干部要提拔做区干部。但他们过去都是贫苦的农民，没有文化，因此，提高他们的文化，就成为提高区村干部一个重要问题。现在焦作干部中学就是为些目的而设立的。
    焦作干部中学校的学生，一般都是经过群众运动，有其一定的阶级觉悟基础，思想上纯洁的青壮年村干部。我们对这些同学教育的目的是：提高文化，提高政治水平，加强为人民服务的观念，培养成具备有一般区干部的条件。这些同学在入学时，虽多数一字不识，但绝不能在教学上、管理上和小学一样，更不能和一般中学一样。
    （一）文化学习：认生字，要从日常生活中所需所用，或常见常闻的学起，从学笔划少的字学起，逐渐再学笔划多的字。但这些同学们不同于儿童，他们理解能力已很高，如你教他个“人”字，他就会猜想姓任的也是这个“人”。这点在教学上要注意，先不要因一个字，而教了好几个同音字，这会影响预定的学习计划和进展；同时，同学们也不易记住。
    由于同学们学习热情，急欲求成，要求多讲字意。但多讲字意，一定要是相同的用法。如负字，只可讲负责任不负责任的负，负担的负，负债的负。但再讲辜负的负，胜负的负，就会使他们思想上引起混乱，不易接受。同时，学生字一定要结合词儿学，单学生字易忘，脱离了学用结合，也影响字意的贯通运用。
    在学词儿和语句中，学习有一二百生字的时候，就可学习浅明的短文章。这些短文章的选择，一定要结合思想教育和生活指导，结合大家思想发展和要求。这样就不仅要注意学生字，而且要反复学习课内的大意。课前，学习组集体准备，课堂上试读试讲，教员讲过后，自习时间学习组集体再研究课意，背诵课意。这样才能印象深刻，才能指导思想行动，而文化学习进度也快。
    （二）巩固学习情绪，提高阶级觉悟，明确学习目的。这是对这同学们的经常工作，这项工作不能做好，就不能达到教育培养的目的。同学们虽然求进心都很浓厚，但都有家庭负担，因此往往受家庭的牵挂，而影响到学习情绪。为巩固学习情绪，在学生家里的生产，村区应与以照顾。今年五月割麦的时候，沁阳县委和区上，都给他本县区学生写来一封信，告诉给他家里割麦的情形，这使当时要求请假回去的同学，都安下心来学习。
    在学校方面并要及时总结学习成绩，使每个人经常看到自己的收获，以及努力方向。如杨小林同学，家人几次来信催他回去结婚，他已请了假，但走的时候，因听了学习总结，就说：“我不回去，我回去住几天，就会落在人家后边。我出校再结婚，……”
    干部中学和一般中学不同，家属的来往很多。我们学校二百多学生，每天来校家属经常有七八人，甚至十多人。对这些家属来校时，有专人组织座谈会，向他们介绍学校学习情况，是很需要的。这样可使家属不致因家事影响了同学们的学习。
    （三）教学管理，要相信大家，发扬民主。由于这些同学们是出身于农村，不习惯集体生活，因此建立必要的学习制度，比较困难。所以制度的规定，必须要通过大家，让大家认识制度的规定是为了啥？在自觉的基础上，大家共同来制定来遵守。开始学校觉得大家生活散漫，觉悟不高，学校虽有制度，也不敢让大家去掌握。这样就命令式的宣布制度。学生不遵守，教员就批评。但这些宣布和批评，并不起作用。有的同学在自习时，还是出校看戏，有的反引起牢骚，闹情绪。后来，便结合大家的思想提高，让大家讨论了学习制度，发扬了民主，大家对自己反而要求更严了。此外再发动小组竞赛，使组里互相督促学习，发扬了团结友爱，使大家进步得更快。
