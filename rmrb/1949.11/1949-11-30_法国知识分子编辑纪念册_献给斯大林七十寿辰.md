The editors of the book include famous figures from the French literary, artistic, legal, and scientific circles, such as Louis Aragon and Frédéric Joliot-Curie. All French intellectuals have been invited to inscribe the commemorative album.

    【新华社北京二十九日电】电通社巴黎讯：法国知识分子正在编一本烫金的纪念册，其中有短文、诗和画，赠送给斯大林大元帅，庆祝他的七十寿辰。人道报称：此项礼物不仅是祝贺斯大林，也是献给斯大林格勒城，因为“他和该城是人民抵抗法西斯野蛮主义的象征”。该书编者包括法国文学、艺术、法律和科学界的著名人物，如路易·阿拉贡和约里奥·居里等法国所有的知识分子都被邀请在该纪念册上题辞。法国人民发动对苏联伟大领袖生日的献礼运动，开展一个“苏联文学月”。在此期间，斯大林的著作、苏联艺术作品及其它书籍，将在法国各地广泛出售。
