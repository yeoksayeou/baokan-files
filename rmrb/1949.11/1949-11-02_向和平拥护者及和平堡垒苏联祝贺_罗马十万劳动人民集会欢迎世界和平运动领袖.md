　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 1st: TASS, Rome: 100,000 Roman laborers held a mass rally at Randren Square on the evening of the 30th to welcome the leaders of the World Peace Movement attending the Second Plenary Session of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress. Joliot-Curie, Nenni, Johnson, Fadeyev, Vittorio, D'Arbó, Dymbosky, and Bauerzon attended the conference.

　　The vast square was packed with people. Tens of thousands of people carried banners and flags congratulating peace supporters and the Soviet Union, the bulwark of peace, as well as portraits of Stalin and Togliatti. They cheered and applauded loudly, welcoming each speaker in turn, for a period of one and a half hours.

　　The conference was opened and presided over by Nenni. Curie delivered a speech on behalf of the scientific community, emphasizing the inseparable link between the purpose of science and the struggle for peace. He also called on millions of peace-loving people in Italy to actively support the resolutions of the Standing Committee's plenary session.

　　The Archbishop of Canterbury, Johnson, then delivered a speech, saying that he represented the vast mass of ordinary parishioners who were determined to maintain peace and oppose war. They fully agreed with the Soviet proposal to ban atomic weapons and other weapons of mass destruction.

　　Abusch, a member of the Provisional Parliament of the German Democratic Republic, said: Germany has just experienced the most prominent event in its history, the establishment of the first truly peaceful and democratic government. He said that German peace advocates are determined to smash the Wall Street ruling group's conspiracy to divide Germany and turn western Germany into a springboard for aggression.

　　Leclerc, representing progressive women in France, said: More and more women are beginning to realize that "praying for peace is not enough; it is also necessary to ensure peace."

　　The famous Soviet writer Fadeyev, on behalf of Soviet peace supporters, paid tribute to all forces truly supporting the cause of peace in Italy, to all those who are fighting for the democratic independence of Italy, against imperialist forces, against war, to workers, progressive intellectuals, and laboring peasants.

　　Nenni delivered the closing remarks, saying: The heads of the imperialist camp and their servants in Italy signed the North Atlantic Treaty, but the Italian people are not bound by it. The signatures of these enemies of peace only give the people this obligation - to spare no effort in the struggle to abolish and destroy this shameful weapon of aggression and enslavement that will bring new disasters and massacres to mankind. Nenni finally shouted, "Death to the North Atlantic Treaty!" The masses in the venue responded with loud cheers.

　　Finally, a grand torchlight parade was held at the conference.

　　向和平拥护者及和平堡垒苏联祝贺
    罗马十万劳动人民集会欢迎世界和平运动领袖
    【新华社北京一日电】塔斯社罗马讯：罗马十万劳动人民于三十日晚在兰德伦广场举行群众大会，欢迎出席世界和平大会常委会二届全会的世界和平运动的领袖们约里奥—居里、南尼、约翰逊、法捷耶夫、维多里奥、达波赛、迪姆鲍斯基、鲍埃逊等都出席了大会。
    巨大的广场挤满了人，上万群众携带着祝贺和平拥护者及和平的堡垒苏联的标语和旗帜以及斯大林和托里亚蒂的肖像，他们高声欢呼和鼓掌，欢迎一个接着一个的演说者，历时一小时半。
    大会由南尼主持开幕。居里代表科学界发表演说，他强调科学的目的与争取和平的斗争之间不可分的联系。他并号召意大利千百万拥护和平的人们积极支持常设委员会全体会议的决议。
    坎特伯雷大主教约翰逊继之发表演讲，他说，他是代表着广大的决心维护和平、反对战争的普通教民群众的。他们完全同意苏联所提出的禁止原子武器及其他大规模毁灭性武器的建议。
    德意志民主共和国临时议会议员阿布许演讲说：德国刚刚经历了它历史上最显赫的事件，成立了第一个真正和平与民主的政府。他说，德国拥护和平者决心粉碎华尔街统治集团企图分裂德国并把德国西部变成侵略跳板的阴谋。
    勒克莱尔代表法国进步妇女说：愈来愈多的妇女开始认识：“祈求和平是不够的，还须确保和平。”
    苏联著名作家法捷耶夫代表苏联和平拥护者，向意大利国内一切真正支持和平事业的力量，向一切为意大利的民主独立而斗争的、反对帝国主义势力、反对战争的人们，向工人、进步知识分子和劳动农民致敬。
    南尼致闭会词说：帝国主义阵营的头目及其在意大利的仆从们在北大西洋公约上签了字，但是，意大利人民不受其约束。这些和平之敌人的签字，只是给了人民这样一个义务——不遗余力地进行斗争，废除并摧毁这个将给人类带来新的灾祸与屠杀的侵略与奴役的可耻武器。南尼最后高呼北大西洋公约死亡！会场上的群众都报以高声欢呼。
    大会最后并举行盛大的火炬游行。
