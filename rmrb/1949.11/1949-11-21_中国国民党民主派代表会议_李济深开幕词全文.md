　　China Kuomintang Democratic Faction Representative Conference
　　Li Jishen's Opening Speech Full Text

　　[Beijing News] The full text of Li Jishen's opening speech at the Representative Conference of the Democratic Faction of the Chinese Kuomintang is as follows:

　　Comrades:

　　Since Chiang Kai-shek usurped the party and harmed the country in 1927, betraying Dr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary Three Principles of the People, the Chinese Kuomintang has been divided into two factions. One is the counter-revolutionary faction, or the dictatorial faction, headed by Chiang Kai-shek; the other is the revolutionary faction, or the democratic faction, that resisted Chiang Kai-shek. Although the Chiang Kai-shek clique used violence to suppress party members at all times, the revolutionary faction developed day by day. Although the Chiang Kai-shek clique had soldiers and money and crushed many anti-Chiang movements, the revolutionary faction's anti-Chiang movement advanced wave upon wave.

　　However, many anti-Chiang movements had a weakness: they did not understand taking the masses of the people as the foundation, they did not understand the necessity of a revolutionary united front, and they could not come up with an accurate political line. This was indeed the main reason for the repeated failures. The Fujian People's Government of 1933 put forward relatively progressive political propositions and concluded a joint anti-Japanese agreement with the Chinese Communist Party, but the prior preparations were insufficient, it could not be combined with the masses of the people, and it could not form a solid united front with the Communist Party, so it could not last.

　　After taking many detours and learning many lessons from the facts, our comrades of the Kuomintang revolutionary faction gradually realized that if they were not united with the revolutionary forces, especially if they were not united with the Communist Party, the anti-Chiang movement could not succeed. Around the end of the Anti-Japanese War, the "Minlian" comrades united in Sichuan and the "Mincu" comrades united in Guangdong and Guangxi generally had this understanding. Although they could not openly express their standing on the side of the Communist Party due to environmental reasons, they were actually responding to the proposals of the Communist Party. On November 12, 1947, the representative conference of the Kuomintang Democratic Faction was held in Hong Kong. On January 1, 1948, the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang was formally established, declaring clearly that we should shoulder the two major tasks proposed by Dr. Sun Yat-sen: anti-feudalism and anti-imperialism, and that we should follow the Three Great Policies established by Dr. Sun Yat-sen, declaring clearly that we should stand on the side of the democratic national revolutionary united front headed by the Communist Party. This can be said to be a truly epoch-making development for the Kuomintang Democratic Faction.

　　The Revolutionary Committee put forward an accurate political line, united democratic elements in the revolutionary united front led by the CPC, and this is the main key to the Kuomintang revolutionary faction being able to develop to where it is today.

　　The revolutionary united front has destroyed the reactionary regime of the Chiang Kai-shek clique. We fully believe that the united front will definitely build a prosperous and powerful People's Republic of China. The Chinese people need every democratic class and every democratic party to give full play to its due role in the great construction project. Therefore, we must further broadly unite the democratic elements of the Kuomintang in the people's democratic united front, so that their abilities can be used to realize the Common Program.

　　Today's representative conference of the Kuomintang Democratic Faction is precisely for the progress and unity of the Kuomintang democratic elements. When the Revolutionary Committee was brewing and even established, we believed that in addition to the comrades participating in the Revolutionary Committee, there were many Kuomintang members who also hated the counter-revolutionary faction or dictatorial faction headed by Chiang Kai-shek, so at that time we were prepared to invite many people to participate in the Revolutionary Committee, but because of the restrictive situation, these many people could not unite with us. Now that this restrictive situation no longer exists, our unity can develop smoothly. There are also many people who were originally good, but in the past, under the threat of the reactionary regime, they could not move. Now these people have been liberated from the reactionary regime and can be united and guided to progress.

　　But today's representative conference of the Kuomintang Democratic Faction is only the initial work of broad unity. All awakened and gradually awakened elements of the Kuomintang must be gradually united and guided to progress. For the needs of the people and for the rapid success of the construction of a new China, we should do this.

　　In this meeting, we must formulate the political tasks that we should and can bear based on the Common Program; we must formulate our organizational constitution based on the basic principles of progress and unity; we must carefully elect a healthier and more powerful central leadership agency. I hope that all representatives will work together to smoothly complete the tasks of this meeting.

　　中国国民党民主派代表会议
　　李济深开幕词全文
    【北京讯】李济深在中国国民党民主派代表会议上的开幕词，全文如下：各位同志：
    自从一九二七年蒋介石篡党祸国、背叛了孙中山先生的革命三民主义以后，中国国民党内部就分裂为两派，其一就是以蒋介石为首的反革命派，或叫作独裁派；其一就是反抗蒋介石的革命派或叫作民主派。虽然蒋介石集团时时刻刻以暴力镇压党员，但革命派是一天天发展的。虽然因为蒋介石集团有兵有钱，把许多次反蒋运动击破了，但革命派的倒蒋运动是前仆后继的。
    然而许多次倒蒋运动，都是有一类弱点；就是不懂得以人民大众为基础，不懂得革命统一战线的必要，拿不出准确的政治路线，这实在是历次失败的主要原因。一九三三年的福建人民政府，算是提出了比较进步的政治主张，也和中国共产党缔结了共同抗日协定，但事前的准备很不够，不能和人民大众相结合，不能和共产党构成坚固的统一战线，所以也不能持久。
    走了许多的迂回的路，受了许多事实的教训，我们国民党革命派的同志才逐渐认识如果没有和革命势力结合在一起，尤其是如果没有和共产党结合在一起，倒蒋运动是不可能成功的。抗日战争结束的前后，在四川结合的“民联”同志和在两粤结合的“民促”同志，大都有了这样的认识。虽然因为环境关系未能公然表示和共产党站在一边，但实际上是响应共产党的主张的。到了一九四七年十一月十二日国民党民主派在香港举行代表会议，一九四八年一月一日中国国民党革命委员会正式成立，明朗地宣示我们要负起孙中山先生所提示的反封建和反帝国主义两大任务，要奉行孙先生所订定的三大政策，明朗地宣示我们要站在以共产党为首的民主民族革命统一战线这一边，这可说是国民党民主派真正划时代的发展。
    革命委员会提出了准确的政治路线，团结了民主分子于中共领导的革命统一战线，这是国民党革命派能够发展到今天的境地的主要关键。
    革命统一战线已经把蒋介石集团的反动政权摧毁了，我们充分相信，统一战线一定建设成功一个繁荣强大的中华人民共和国。中国人民需要每一个民主阶层、每一个民主党派尽量发挥其应有的作用于伟大的建国工程，因此，我们就必须进一步广大地团结国民党的民主分子于人民民主统一战线中，使他们的能力都为实现共同纲领而使用。
    今天的国民党民主派代表会议正是为了国民党民主分子的进步和团结。当革命委员会酝酿以至成立的时候，我们就认定除参加革命委员会的同志外，还有许多国民党员也是厌恶以蒋介石为首的反革命派或独裁派的，所以那时候我们就准备着要邀请许多人参加革命委员会，只因为形格势禁，这许多人未能和我们团结在一起。现在这种格禁的形势已经不存在了，我们的团结就可以顺利地发展。还有许多原是善良的人，过去因为在反动政权威胁之下，动弹不得，现在这些人已从反动政权解放出来了，可以团结他们，引导他们进步了。
    但今天的国民党民主派代表会议，不过是广大团结的初步工作。所有国民党的觉悟分子及逐渐觉悟分子，我们必须逐渐团结他们，引导他们进步。为了人民的需要，为了新中国建设的尽速成功，我们是应该这样做的。
    在这次会议中，我们要根据共同纲领订定我们应该负担而且可能负担的政治任务；我们要根据进步与团结这一基本原则订定我们的组织总章，我们要慎重选出更健全有力的中央领导机构。希望诸位代表共同努力，顺利地完成这一次会议的任务。
