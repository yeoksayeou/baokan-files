【Beijing News】The two representatives from the Beijing Water Company who attended the Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference expressed their warm support for the resolution passed by the conference to nationalize the water company. Liu Zhenfu, manager of the Water Company (representative of industry and commerce), said: "Nationalizing the water company is absolutely necessary. Because it is related to the lives and health of all the people in the city; although it has been established for more than 40 years, the number of people in the city who have access to tap water is still less than 50% of the city's population. If it is changed to state-owned, I believe there will be great development in the short term. A considerable part of the company's assets were added during the period of enemy and puppet regimes, and there are also shares held by traitors. If they are nationalized, they can be quickly cleared up."

Liu Zhendong, deputy director of the Water Company's trade union (representative of the trade union), said: "The Water Company has been a bureaucratic institution for the past 40 years, always focusing on making money and not considering the water use of the city's citizens. Now that we are liberated, the worker comrades have repeatedly demanded that it be taken back into public ownership in order to achieve universal water use throughout the city. This is the wish of our worker comrades, and we unanimously support this resolution."

　　京自来水公司即将收归国营
　　自来水公司代表热烈拥护
    【北京讯】自来水公司出席北京市本届各界人民代表会议的两位代表，对这次大会通过的自来水公司收归国营案，表示热烈拥护。自来水公司经理刘振福（工商界代表）说："自来水公司收归国营，实属必要。因为它关系全市人民生活与健康；它创办虽已四十多年，而全市吃自来水的还不及全市人口百分之五十，如改国营，相信短期内可有很大的发展。该公司财产有不少敌伪时期增添的，还有汉奸的股子，如收归国营，就可迅速加以清理了。"
    自来水公司工会副主任刘振东（工会代表）说："自来水公司过去四十年，一直是个官僚机构，处处为了赚钱，不为全市市民用水设想。现在解放了，工人同志们一再要求收回公营，以达到普及全市用水，这是我们工人同志们的志愿，我们一致拥护这项决议。"
