Run Winter Schools Well in Combination with Winter Production

[This newspaper reports] The CCP Chahar Provincial Committee has called on all branches and all Party members in the province to launch a winter school movement. The call first pointed out: "Now that autumn has passed, the slack farming season has arrived. The former North China People's Government and the Provincial People's Government have instructed all localities to launch a mass winter school movement this winter. All branches and all Party members must complete this work as one of the important tasks this winter." Therefore, all Party members "must deeply understand the importance of launching the winter school movement this winter, which lies in raising the people's awareness and cultural life, so as to ensure the victorious completion of various winter work tasks, and lay a solid ideological foundation for launching next year's large-scale production movement." The call also proposed: "At the same time, strive to eliminate illiteracy among young people in about three years, and improve the cultural level and scientific knowledge of the broad masses of people, so as to better carry out production and all construction of New China." "Therefore, the Provincial Party Committee specially calls on all branches to play a fortress role in the winter school movement, as in other movements, to persuade the masses, to lead the masses with the exemplary actions of Party members actively participating in winter schools, and to run the winter schools in their villages well in combination with winter production and other work."
