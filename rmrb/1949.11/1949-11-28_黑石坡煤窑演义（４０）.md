The Black Stone Slope Coal Mine Chronicles (40)
    Kang Tuo

　　Old Yin learned about the organization of iron furnace and coal kiln production in nearby villages while at Pingtan Ridge. It turned out that the rural coal and iron handicraft production in the Yangquan and Pingding areas was mostly ruined by the Japanese invaders, traitors, and Yan Xishan over the years, just like the Black Stone Slope Coal Mine. Some traitorous furnace owners ran away when liberation came, leaving behind destroyed furnaces with no one to manage them. Still other private furnace owners were nearly all in the same situation as Xi Lu, exploited into bankruptcy and forced to stop work by the enemy, puppets, and traitors. Most had no energy to try again, and simply didn't have the strength to recover. As for public loans? At the time, the war in North China was intense, and the harvests weren't strong, so there was simply no way to devote a large amount of resources to taking care of the rural handicraft industry. Since neither the public nor private sectors had the strength, but the workers needed to eat and make a living, everyone organized themselves, making use of old furnace sites, old kilns, and old equipment. The public sector provided some capital and sales channels, or borrowed some fruits of victory, or put in some free labor, engaging in small-scale, cooperative operations. They were working hard, and most of the workers were enthusiastic and had many ideas, doing a great job. The quantity and quality of their products even exceeded the past. However, some were not doing so well, and many problems arose. In the vicinity of Pingtan Ridge, iron furnaces and sulfur factories achieved relatively great success, but coal kilns, because they were close to large mechanized mines, were being squeezed out of the market because the large mines started production with small capital, large output, and good quality coal. They were not as good as the iron and sulfur industries. Based on these experiences, Old Yin and the leadership concluded that the kiln at Black Stone Slope should be restored. It would be best to mobilize Xi Lu to do it. If that wasn't possible, they should mobilize the workers' enthusiasm and organize cooperative production, but they should pay attention to sales channels and the problems that had already occurred in cooperative production in various places. Old Yin brought this opinion back to Black Stone Slope Village.

　　In the village, Old Yin discussed it with Xi Lu again and mobilized him to do it, but he still refused. He also knew something about the production situation in the surrounding villages. He also very much agreed with the workers pooling their shares to run it, and said, "Anyway, I'm happy to invest a share in myself and work with everyone." But after the workers grumbled for a while, they really wanted to run the kiln, but they still didn't have a definite idea. Some advocated that Xi Lu should open the kiln, and some hoped that the public sector would lead and manage it. There were also those who proposed running it as a shareholding venture, but there were not many of these people. Moreover, the group led by Tai Cheng, who were moving around at the West Kiln, were still vehemently opposed to running this big kiln, shouting nonsense about it being unsafe and about Old Yin. It was a noisy mess, and no clear path could be discerned. Some of the kiln workers added up the costs of materials and labor for the water drainage and ventilation shaft project, saying that it would take at least a thousand catties of grain! As a result, the village was in an uproar over the kiln opening, and Old Yin, craning his neck and blinking his eyes, thought for a while, but he still felt vague and had no definite solution. At the same time, the village was busy. The poor peasant group and the workers' and peasants' association were only enthusiastic about dividing the fruits of victory at this time. In addition, there were public grain, requisitioned labor, women's, youth, and other tasks. Once the masses were mobilized, everything had to be discussed repeatedly, and the cadres were dizzy with work. The land distribution was even more up in the air... That night, Old Yin sought out Shuan Cheng and Bian Xiao, wanting to review and plan the overall work carefully, but he received a notice calling him to a meeting in the district. Early the next morning, he took a trip to Pingtan Ridge, but came back with a production plan: to have people carry sulfurous stones to the Yangquan Iron Factory from several villages nearby that produced them, earning transportation fees. He said, "Opening the kiln is really not something that can be done in a short time! I think you should organize some people to do this cheap transportation job first! Remember to quickly divide the floating wealth and seize the work. It would be best to have the land distributed by the time I get back. As for the kiln opening, Shuan Cheng, you should divide the work, find a few people to discuss it specifically. It's best to get it started, or we'll have to wait until I get back to talk about it." After settling things, he hurried off to the meeting. The matter of the big kiln had been discussed for several days, but it ended without a clear resolution.

Thirty-seven Carrying Sulfurous Stone

　　After Old Yin left, the matter of opening the kiln was temporarily shelved, and no one came to organize a discussion. The transportation of sulfurous stone was supposed to be organized by Little Foreign Devil, but it didn't get organized either. People all complained that the road was long, strenuous, and didn't pay much, so no one would do it. Some people even said, "Why don't we mine the coal in our own village, instead of carrying sulfurous stone from other villages? Isn't that like taking off your pants to fart, just making more work for yourself!" Little Foreign Devil explained to people, "It's not like Comrade Yin didn't think about opening the kiln and mining coal! But where would the funds come from? Besides, this carrying sulfurous stone, even though it doesn't mean much, is still what Comrade Yin said: it's better than starving! If Hua Da plans it, could it not be confidential?" Someone mocked, "Little Foreign Devil, then you, as a cadre, should take the lead in carrying it!" Another said, "Anyway, you swore you wouldn't go down the kiln, so this carrying job is perfect for you, isn't it, Little Foreign Devil?" Still another said, "The principles that Comrade Yin taught you, Little Foreign Devil, maybe you've forgotten some of them! Anyway, just based on these two sentences of yours, we won't be convinced." As a result, Little Foreign Devil also stammered and slowly changed his tone, saying, "Hey, why do you all twist things? It's not like I don't know that carrying sulfurous stone doesn't mean anything, but damn it, we can't be without a job! As for opening the kiln, didn't Comrade Yin also say that he wanted us to open it? But can we find the funds? Can we find someone to take the lead and make arrangements? Alas... I think I'll go find Shuan Cheng and them to discuss it!" Little Foreign Devil sighed again and went around asking, looking for Shuan Cheng.

　　Shuan Cheng was busy dividing the fruits of victory and some other things. Organizing production was assigned to Little Foreign Devil, so he couldn't say for sure what would happen. Things dragged on, and people in the village were just resting and loafing around all day, just waiting to divide the fruits of victory and not having a job. Later, there were two or three who were really too poor and couldn't rest, so they went to carry sulfurous stone once or twice. When they returned to the village and met a group of loafers, someone asked, "How is it? Not bad, right!" One of them said, "Damn it, you have to run hard when you carry it. After running two trips all day, I earned two catties of rice, but I also wore out the soles of my shoes!" People "boomed" with laughter, then giggled and joked. After that, no one went to carry sulfurous stone anymore.

　　黑石坡煤窑演义（４０）
    康濯
    老尹在平潭垴了解了一些左近各村组织铁炉煤窑生产的情形。原来阳泉平定一带农村的煤铁手工业生产，大都和黑石坡煤窑一样，这些年来被日寇汉奸阎锡山毁得不成样子；有些汉奸炉窑主在解放的时候跑了，撂下毁了的炉窑没人管，还有些私人炉窑主，却差不多都跟喜禄一样，敌伪汉奸给压榨得破了产停了工，多半没劲头再闹，也根本没力量恢复。公家贷款么？当时华北战争正紧张，年景又不强，一时实在也没法拿很大的力量来照顾这里的农村手工业。这样公私都没力量，工人们却要吃饭要营生干，因此大家就自己组织起来，利用一些旧炉场、旧窑、旧家具，公家多少帮助点资本和销路，或是借点胜利果实，或是花点白工，小打小闹，碰股合作经营，干得正烘火，而且多数工人劲头挺大办法挺多，干得挺好，出品的数量质量还有超过过去的；但也有少数干得不大好，问题闹得挺多的。在平潭垴左近，铁炉和硫磺厂比较闹得成绩大，煤窑却因为离机器大矿近，那些大矿一动工，本钱小，产量多，质量又好，小土煤窑多给压得没销路，不如铁业和硫磺。老尹和领导上根据这些经验研究的结果，觉得黑石坡的窑应该恢复，最好是动员喜禄来干，不能的话，就发动工人的积极性，组织合作生产，不过要注意销路和各地合作生产当中已经发生的问题。老尹就带了这个意见，回黑石坡村来了。
    在村里，老尹又跟喜禄商议了一回，并又动员他干，他还是不；他也知道一些周围各村生产的情形，他也很赞成工人合伙碰股子闹，并说：“咱反正也乐意入个身股，跟大伙一道干。”但工人们咯嚷了一回，窑倒是挺想干，却还没个准主意，有的主张由喜禄来开窑，有的希望公家来领导经管；也有提出要碰股闹的，但这人数不多；而且泰成那伙正在西窑动弹的，还是一个劲反对闹这大窑，什么不保险啦老尹爷啦又瞎嚷一气，乱嘈嘈理不出个头绪。也有窑黑给这窑打水透风筒的工程合计了一下垫本和人力，说是起码也得上千斤粮食！这么一来，村里为开窑的事闹了个满天的风雨，老尹一个人仰着脖子扑展着眼皮想了一阵，怎么也觉着嘀嘀咕咕地，没个准办法。同时村里正忙，贫农组工农会这会光对分果实有劲，此外又有公粮、勤务、妇女、青年等等工作，群众一发动，是什么也得反复讨论，干部忙得个昏头转向，分土地的事更没个眉目……这天晚上，老尹寻见拴成和扁小们，想再好好把整个工作检讨计划一下，却又接到通知，叫他去分区开会。第二天大早，他上平潭垴走了一遭，回来却给带回个生产：让人们往左近几个出硔石的村子担硔送阳泉铁厂，挣脚钱，他说：“这开窑实在是一时半时没法往起闹！我看你们组织些人，先检担硔这便宜营生干干再说吧！结记着千万快分浮财，抓紧工作，最好赶我回来就分地。开窑的事，拴成，你们分分工，找几个人专门讨论讨论，最好还是要闹起来，要不等我回来再说。”他这么安顿下，就匆忙开会去了；大窑的事闹了好些天，也就这么没闹下个长短。
    三十七　担硔
    老尹走了以后，开窑的事一时就搁下了，没人来组织讨论。担硔的营生，叫小洋鬼组织，却也没组织起来。人们都嫌跑道多费力大挣钱少，谁也不干，并有人说：“放着咱村这么海的灰不刨，反倒去外村担硔，这不是脱裤子放屁，多费手脚！”小洋鬼跟人解说道：“光说开窑刨灰的，尹同志也不是没合计过这呀！可哪来花销垫本啊！再说这担硔，虽说意思不大，可还是尹同志的话：总比呆着挨饿强呀！人家华大计划的，莫非还会不机密？”人们隙这个说：“小洋鬼，那你干部带头先担呀！”那个说：“反正你是发誓不下窑的，这担脚营生不正对你的事么，小洋鬼对吧？”还有的说：“尹同志教给你的道理，小洋鬼你许是忘了些吧！反正光凭你这两句，咱可是不信服。”这么一来，闹得小洋鬼也支支扭扭地，慢慢转过口气道：“嗨，看你们怎么光往歪里说？我也不是不知道担硔没意思，可操他妈别没营生嘛！光说开窑，尹同志不是也说过叫咱们开么？可能闹下垫本么？能寻上出头张罗的人么？唉……我看我找拴成他们讨论讨论去！”小洋鬼就又叹息着，到处打问，寻拴成去了。
    拴成当时正忙着分果实和一些别的事，组织生产是分工分给小洋鬼负责的，因此一时也说不出个长短，这么摩摩蹭蹭地，闹得村里人们都是整天歇着闲捣拉，光等着分果实，没营生干。后来也有三两个实在太困难也实在歇不住的，去担了一两回硔；他们回到村里，碰见闲捣拉的人堆，有人问道：“怎么样？不赖吧！”他们中有人说：“操他妈担起来使劲跑，好容易一天担了两遭，挣了二斤米，可把我这鞋底也磨破了！”人们“轰”地笑了，跟着又嘻嘻哈哈耍笑开来，以后就再也没有什么人担硔去了。
