　　The speech by Roula Koukoulou, General Secretary of the National Democratic Women's Federation of Greece, was warmly welcomed by the entire audience. She described the cruel attacks by the American-Greek reactionaries and the heroic struggles of the Greek people, in which Greek women actively participated. She said: We are full of confidence in the future. We are moving forward bravely and confidently because the great Stalin – whose name has become the banner of freedom – lives in our hearts.
    When Dolores Ibárruri, the heroic fighter for the freedom and independence of the Spanish people, spoke, she emphasized that the Americans are attempting to use Spain as a springboard and base for war and aggression. Therefore, for the benefit of all peoples, the struggle against aiding the Franco regime is not only an urgent task for British and American men and women, but must also be an urgent task for men and women all over the world who are fighting against the threat of war and for lasting peace.
    The last speaker was Popova, Vice-Chairman of the Women's International Democratic Federation. On behalf of millions of Soviet women, she assured the Council meeting of the Women's International Democratic Federation that Soviet women will always stand at the forefront of the struggle for peace. She said: We will surely win victory because our leader is our beloved Stalin. Popova's words won stormy and lasting applause. The representatives unanimously cheered and paid tribute to the great leader of the Soviet people, Joseph Stalin, with cheers lasting for several minutes.
    At the meeting on the 17th, a letter from Eugénie Cotton, Chairman of the Women's International Democratic Federation, was read, explaining that she was unable to attend the meeting due to her husband's serious illness. She wrote: Our great federation must play a huge role in the movement to support peace. I believe that the federation will define this task very clearly in Moscow so that we can resolutely and victoriously undertake this task.

　　全体代表热烈欢呼
  　向斯大林致敬
    希腊全国民主妇联总书记鲁拉·库考卢的发言，受到全场热烈的欢迎。她叙述了美希反动派的残酷进攻、及希腊妇女所积极参加的希腊人民的英勇斗争。她说：我们对将来是充满信心的。我们正勇敢而怀着信心地前进，因为伟大的斯大林——他的名字已经成为自由的旗帜——活在我们的心上。
    争取西班牙人民自由与独立的英勇斗士伊巴露丽发言时强调指出：美国人正企图利用西班牙作为战争与侵略的跳板和基地。所以，为了各国人民的利益，反对援助佛朗哥政权的斗争不仅是英国和美国男女的迫切任务，而且也必须是全世界各地反对战争威胁、为持久和平而斗争的男女们的迫切任务。
    最后发言的是国际民主妇联副主席波波娃。她代表千百万苏联妇女向国际民主妇联理事会会议保证：苏联妇女永远站在争取和平斗争的前卫。她说：我们一定能赢得胜利，因为我们的领导者是我们亲爱的斯大林。波波娃的话博得暴风雨般的、历久不息的掌声。代表们一致欢呼，向苏联人民的伟大领袖约瑟夫·斯大林致敬，欢呼声连续达数分钟之久。
    十七日的会议上宣读了国际民主妇联主席尤金尼·戈登的来信，她因丈夫重病而未克出席会议。她写道：我们伟大的妇联要在拥护和平的运动中起巨大的作用。我相信：妇联将在莫斯科极其明确地订出这一任务，以便我们能够把这一任务坚决而胜利地负担起来。
