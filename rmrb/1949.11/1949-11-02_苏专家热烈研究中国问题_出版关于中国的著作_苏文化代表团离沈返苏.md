Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 1st: Moscow dispatch: Soviet scientists have now completed several works studying Chinese issues. Prominent scientific workers have recently published a collection of "Study Notes of the Pacific Institute of the Soviet Academy of Sciences." This book includes research reports on history, economics, and the Chinese people's anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle. Staff at the Pacific Institute have also completed a compilation entitled "The National Liberation Movement of the Peoples of East Asia." This book has a preface by Zhukov, Director of the Pacific Institute and Corresponding Academician of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, discussing the people's democratic state apparatus of New China. The compilation also contains a report by the young expert on Eastern issues, Yastafyev, analyzing the modern Chinese people's revolutionary struggle, entitled "From Semi-Colony to People's Democracy." Vyatkin, who made a valuable contribution to Soviet history, has also authored a book on the Chinese Great Revolution of 1925-1927 and the policy of American imperialism towards China. In this book, Vyatkin discusses the formation of an alliance between the American ruling clique and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique between 1925 and 1927 and exposes the conspiracy of bourgeois historical falsifiers, who attempt to portray American imperialist policy towards China from 1925 to 1927 as a policy of "sympathy" for the Chinese people's desire for independence.

    【新华社北京一日电】莫斯科讯：苏联科学家现已完成若干关于中国问题研究的著作。著名的科学工作者们最近发表了一本“苏联科学院太平洋研究所学习笔记”专辑。该书包括有关历史、经济及中国人民反帝国主义革命斗争的研究报告。太平洋研究所的人员们，并完成了一册题为“东亚人民的民族解放运动”的汇编，该书有太平洋研究所所长、苏联科学院通讯院士茹科夫的一篇序文，文中论及新中国的人民民主国家机构。汇编中并载有年青的东方问题专家亚斯塔夫叶夫所写的分析现代中国人民革命斗争的报告，题目是“从半殖民地到人民民主主义”。对苏联历史学有宝贵供献的佛雅特金也著了一本论一九二五——一九二七年的中国大革命及美帝国主义对华政策的著作。佛雅特金在这本书中讨论了美国统治集团与蒋介石卖国集团在一九二五——一九二七年间形成联盟的问题，并揭穿了资产阶级历史伪造者的阴谋，他们企图把一九二五年到一九二七年美国对中国的帝国主义政策，描写为“同情”中国人民独立愿望的政策。
