　　Remembering My Son's Sacrifice
　　Tao Cheng

　　In 1926, during the height of the Great Revolution, tens of thousands of peasants and workers in Changsha rose up. Workers carried carrying poles, farmers held hoes, and students organized pickets with wooden sticks, parading through the streets, shouting "Down with imperialism!" "Down with warlords!" "Down with corrupt officials, bureaucrats, and local bullies!".... My eldest son, Ouyang Li'an, was fourteen years old and studying at Changsha Xiuye School. He was the captain of the first picket team. He had a red, chubby face, bright eyes, and a determined character. From the moment he joined the movement, the children in the school gathered around him. He led the pickets on street patrols, prohibited gambling on the roads, and raised money to help disaster victims. The Changsha Education Association held a public assembly, and Li'an represented the students on stage to give a speech. Standing on the stage, people below could only see half of his body, but his voice was loud and clear, and every sentence aroused enthusiastic shouts and applause from the crowd. After the meeting, he happily returned home and said to me, "Mom, my voice is hoarse."

　　As the revolutionary situation developed rapidly, the reactionaries became even more reactionary. In 1927, Chiang Kai-shek betrayed the revolution, carrying out a massive slaughter of Communists and the worker-peasant masses. In the "May 21st" Hunan Incident (the "Ma-Ri Incident"), Chiang's party member Xu Kexiang besieged the Provincial Federation of Trade Unions. My husband, Comrade Ouyang Meisheng, was a Communist Party member and was wanted by the reactionaries. He could not stay in Hunan and went to Wuhan to serve as the secretary of the Provincial Committee. I was in Changsha with five children and could not make a living, so I also went to Wuhan to join my husband. At this time, my eldest son, Li'an, served as a messenger. He knew the addresses of several secret organs of our Party. He was very alert and quick-witted. Once, his father was holding a meeting in a house when the enemy discovered it and sent police to arrest them. The attendees had not yet arrived, so Li'an led his father out the back door and hid in a nearby temple, safely escaping danger. At this time, white terror enveloped Wuhan. People were being killed every day, and the more people were killed, the more determined the Communists became. At that time, I would fold eight copies of the "Dajiang Daily" (a Party newspaper edited by Comrade Xie Juezai) every day and tie them around Li'an's waist, covering them well with a black cloth cotton coat. This brave little messenger braved the cold wind of December, treading on the wet and slippery snow-covered road, and delivered them to our Party's organ in the thatched huts where the workers lived in Yingwuzhou, Hanyang, five miles away. When the newspapers were taken off Li'an's body, their eyes stared at the brave child in a daze.

　　Once, Li'an was delivering newspapers to house number 17 when he saw enemy police and detectives with peaked caps inside. As Li'an was walking towards the house, someone asked him: "What are you doing?" He calmly asked in return: "Excuse me, is number 18 here?" The man said: "Number 18 is next door." Li'an then retreated. In order to prevent our own people from encountering danger again, he took a piece of black charcoal from the stove and went to a quiet place on the riverbank, burned the newspapers on his body with matches, and then returned to the outside of the door of number 17 and drew a warning sign on the wall with black charcoal. My son's deeds are forever etched in my heart.

　　In 1928, my husband became ill and died after working tirelessly for the revolution. Soon after, I went to Shanghai. Due to the pressure of life, Li'an, my second son and I went to work in a cotton mill. I met Comrade He Mengxiong of the Provincial Committee, who introduced Li'an to the Youth League. From then on, Li'an became active in the factories in Pudong, Puxi, Zhabei, and Nanshi. For the sake of revolutionary work, he often mingled in the yarn workshops at night, living and talking with the workers, and composing songs. "Workers complain about their suffering, listen carefully to their words, get up at five in the morning, and have a big pancake for breakfast." This song was sung everywhere in the workshops. He would not go home even when he was sick, and slept next to the machines at night. The workers liked him and were close to him. Party leaflets and pamphlets were flown by him into the yarn workshops and into the hands of the masses. The workers' movement against oppression and demanding higher wages continued to rise and often achieved victory. Once, Li'an mobilized more than 300 child laborers to inspect the dog track on Huade Road in Pudong. As he was about to enter the arena with a bunch of red flag banners in his hand, a truck from the police station came and arrested more than a dozen people, but Li'an cleverly ran away. In January 1930, our Party held a national youth worker representative conference, and Li'an was elected as a youth worker representative and sent to the Soviet Union. At the end of the year, when he returned to China, I saw that he had grown taller, with a chubby face, wearing a blue cloth cotton robe, affectionately calling me "Mom."

　　Less than a month after Li'an returned to China, he was arrested while attending a meeting at the Oriental Hotel on Sanma Road in Shanghai. When he was brought to court for trial, he did not give any confession. A traitor testified that his family were all Communists. When he realized that he could not be saved, he resolutely said: "Kill me if you want, we have people all over the world." Before his execution, he shouted "Long live the Communist Party!" My son—Li'an thus gloriously sacrificed himself. This time, the Kuomintang executioners killed more than thirty of our comrades, all of whom were basic cadres of the Party. They sacrificed themselves for the cause of the people. This is the glory of our Party, and it is also the glory of the Chinese people.

　　It has been nineteen years since my son died. His red chubby face and the image of him wearing a blue cotton robe still seem to be in front of me. The call of "Dear Mom" still lingers in my ears. He was only eighteen years old, but he gave his last drop of blood for the motherland. Today, on the eve of the nationwide revolutionary victory, amidst the victorious advance of the People's Liberation Army, no matter where the demon king Chiang Kai-shek escapes to, the people will definitely arrest him and bring him to justice for a public trial, to avenge the martyrs who gloriously died for the Party, and to avenge the people of the whole country!

　　回忆儿子的牺牲
    陶承
    一九二六年正当大革命高潮的时候，长沙成千成万的农醚工人起来了。工人肩负着扁担，农民拿着锄头，学生们组织纠察队，手持木棍，在街上游行，高喊“打倒帝国主义！”“打倒军阀！”“打倒贪官污吏土豪劣绅！”…。我的大儿子，欧阳立安，十四岁，在长沙修业学校读书，他是纠察队第一队队长。他有红胖的脸，晶亮的眼睛，刚毅的性格，从他参加运动起，学校里的儿童就围绕在他的身边。他带着纠察队街上巡逻，禁止拦路赌博，并募捐救济灾民。长沙教育会召开民众大会，立安代表学生上台讲演，站在台上，台底下的人虽只能看到他半个身子，但他声音响亮，每句话都能激起群众热情的吼声、掌声。会毕，他高兴的回家，对我说：“妈妈，我的嗓子哑了”。
    革命形势急激地向前发展，反动派就更加反动，一九二七年，蒋介石叛变革命，大屠杀共产党人和工农大众。“五二一”湖南事变（即“马日事变”），蒋党许克祥围攻全省总工会，我的丈夫，欧阳梅生同志是共产党员，被反动派通缉，湖南不能住，到武汉任省委秘书。我在长沙带着五个儿女，不能生活，也到了武汉丈夫处。这时候，我的大儿立安，担任交通。他知道我党几个秘密机关的地址，他很机警灵敏，一次他的父亲在一个屋子开会，被敌人发觉了，派警察来逮捕，开会人还没有到齐，立安即带着他父亲出后门躲到隔壁庙里，平安的脱了险。这时白色恐怖笼罩了武汉，每天杀人，杀得越利害，共产党人也越坚决。那时，我每天折八份“大江报”（是党报，谢觉哉同志负责编辑），扎在立安的腰上，用黑布棉衣盖得好好的。这个英勇的小交通员，冒着十二月的寒风，踏着潮湿滑人的雪路，送到五里路外汉阳鹦鹉洲的我党机关，工人住着的茅屋里。当从立安身上取下报纸时，他们的眼光都望着英勇的孩子出神。
    有一回立安送报到十七号房子，屋内已有敌人的警察及带凸帽子的特务，立安正向屋子走去，就有人问他：干什么的？他态度极平静地反问：“借问先生，十八号是这里么？”那人说：隔壁是十八号。立安便退了出来。为着使自己人不再去遇险，他就在灶头上拿了一块黑炭，走到河堤背静处用洋火烧了身上的报纸，又回到十七号的门外，用黑炭在墙壁上画了个警号。儿子的这些事迹，永远记在我的心中。
    一九二八年。我丈夫为革命奔劳成疾，病死后，我不久到了上海，由于生活的逼迫，我和立安及第二个儿子进纱厂做工。我会着省委何梦雄同志，他介绍立安入青年团。从这时候起，立安又活跃于沪东、沪西、闸北、南市的工厂里。为了革命工作，经常晚上混在纱间，同工人一起生活、谈话、编歌曲。“工人提苦情，说话仔细听，早上五点就起身，一个大饼当点心。”这歌声在工房里到处唱着。他生病都不回家，晚上在机器旁边睡觉，工人喜欢他，接近他。党的传单小册子由他飞到纱间里，飞到群众手里。工人反对压迫、要求提高工资的运动不断起来，并且常常得到胜利。有一次立安发动三百多童工，到沪东华德路跑狗场检阅，他手拿了一束红线旗帜，正要出场，巡捕房开来一辆卡车，捉去十多个人，立安却机警地跑掉了。一九三○年一月，我党召开全国青工代表大会，立安被选为青工代表，并被派去苏联。年底回国，我看到他已长大了，胖胖的脸，穿着蓝线布棉袍子，亲爱的叫着妈妈。
    立安回国不到一月，当在上海三马路东方旅馆去开会时被捕了，当他被押到法庭审判的时候，没有说出任何口供。有个叛徒对证说他一家是共产党，当他明白自己不能有救的时候，就坚毅的说：“要杀就杀，全世界都有我们的人。”临刑时，他高呼“共产党万岁！”我的儿子——立安就这样光荣地就义了。这一回，国民党刽子手杀了我们三十多个同志，都是党的基本干部，他们为人民事业而牺牲了。这是我党的光荣，同时也是中国人民的光荣。
    我儿子死去，到现在已十九年了，他那红胖的脸和穿着蓝棉袍子的影子，犹似在我的面前。亲爱的妈妈的呼声，依然留在我耳畔。他只有十八岁，就为祖国尽了最后一滴血。在全国革命胜利的今天，在人民解放军胜利的进军声中，不管魔王蒋介石逃到天涯海角，人民一定要将他缉拿归案公审，给为党光荣殉国先烈报仇，为全国人民报仇！
