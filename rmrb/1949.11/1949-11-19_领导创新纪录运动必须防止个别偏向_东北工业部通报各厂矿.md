　　Leading the Innovation Record Movement Must Prevent Individual Bias
  　Northeast Ministry of Industry Issues Circular to Factories and Mines
    [This Newspaper News] The Northeast People's Government Ministry of Industry issued a circular on November 5th, calling on all factories and mines to pay attention to preventing individual biases in the creative new production record movement. The full text of the circular is as follows:
    The movement to create new records has gradually unfolded. The majority of factories and mines, from leadership to workers, are enthusiastically responding to this call, and various new record creators continue to emerge. As a result, output and quality have improved, technical operation methods have been improved, and the efficiency of machines has been brought into play... There are new records, new inventions, and new creations. In order to further deepen the movement, it is necessary to pay attention to the biases occurring in the movement (even very small biases) in a timely manner and correct them. Now, based on the understanding of the situation in some factories and mines, the following points are notified, hoping that all factories and mines will study and refer to them to better grasp the progress of leading the movement.
    (1) Many individual new records have appeared, but the overall production tasks have not been completed. This is mainly because the organization and system of production management have not yet been improved. The phenomenon that occurred in Machine Factory No. 1 reminds us: on the one hand, cherish the new records of a workshop, a team, a group, and an individual, be good at summarizing them and promoting them to every corner of the factory, and call on everyone to learn from them, creating a climax in the new record movement in the factory and mine. At the same time, on the other hand, with the mobilization of the masses and the emergence of new records, it is necessary to study, review, and improve the past management system so that it is combined with the creation of the masses. Its direct purpose and main symbol is to complete and exceed the predetermined production plan and production tasks, so that the new record movement will not be separated from the production plan and production tasks.
    (2) The scrap rate has increased compared to the past. In October, the scrap rate of Machine Factory No. 3 was 7.4% for processing and 9.46% for castings. In September, the scrap rate was 1.85% for processing and 6% for castings. Although this is a partial phenomenon, it tells us that in the stage of further deepening the movement, we must attach importance to improving quality. Any phenomenon that only emphasizes quantity and shortens working hours, reduces weight specifications, or raises consumption standards is harmful and wrong. Paying attention to establishing and improving a strict finished product inspection system can prevent the new record movement from developing a bias of simply pursuing quantity and disregarding quality, and create records of reducing or eliminating scrap.
    (3) Conducting small-scale tests first can prevent great waste. Fushun Steel Plant failed twice in its trial refining of high-speed steel, and succeeded the third time. The workers' enthusiasm and spirit of research are extremely commendable. The successful refining of high-speed steel is of great significance and value. However, because no attention was paid to small-scale tests in advance, more than 2 billion yuan was lost in the two failures. This is worth our attention in the future: when there is no certainty about new creations and inventions, small-scale tests should be carried out, and after success, experience should be gained before engaging in formal production.
    (4) Blindly creating new records. In order to create new records, the workers of the electrolysis department of the Chemical Factory simultaneously added soda ash and hydrochloric acid to the container (this work was immediately corrected by the leaders of the chemical factory during the process), hoping to speed up the electrolysis. But in reality, the two met and immediately neutralized, losing their effect and wasting raw materials. This is a manifestation of the workers' enthusiasm but lack of technical and theoretical guidance and failure to learn. Therefore, we should strengthen the organization of employees to study theoretical knowledge and business skills, so that all employees can improve in the new record movement.
    (5) The phenomenon of overtime has increased. The overtime pay of the Jinxi Hardened Oil Factory of the Chemical Industry Bureau in October has doubled compared to the past. The factory stipulated that overtime must be approved by the factory department, but the workers were in high spirits in order to create new records, and the scene could not be controlled. In other factories, some workers stay up at night and continue to work during the day, unwilling to rest. Although these stem from the workers' enthusiasm and initiative, in order to maintain regular and lasting new records, the health of the workers should be cherished and cared for. All factories and mines should ensure the tense work of normal working hours and strict labor discipline, but do not arbitrarily work overtime.
    The above factories have made great achievements in the innovation record movement, and individual biases are individual phenomena in the current movement. The reason for their occurrence is that the attention of leading cadres at all levels is only focused on one-sided problems in innovation records, and they have not grasped the overall picture of new records. In order to arouse the attention of leading cadres at all levels and avoid repeating mistakes, so that the movement can be better unfolded, a comprehensive circular is issued. All factories and mines must not affect the leadership's timidity and restraint on the movement because of this, let alone use it as an excuse not to engage in the movement. If any bias is found in the new record movement, it should be reflected at any time, and suggestions for improvement should be put forward.

### 领导创新纪录运动必须防止个别偏向　东北工业部通报各厂矿

　　领导创新纪录运动必须防止个别偏向
  　东北工业部通报各厂矿
    【本报讯】东北人民政府工业部十一月五日发出通报，号召各厂矿注意防止创造生产新纪录运动中的个别偏向，通报原文如下：
    创造新纪录运动已逐渐展开，多数厂矿从领导到工人都在热烈响应这一号召，各种不同的新纪录创造者继续不断的涌现。因此，产量质量提高了，技术操作方法改进了，机器的效能发挥了，……有了新的纪录，新的发明，新的创造。为了使运动进一步深入，必须及时注意运动中发生的偏向（即使是很小的偏向），予以纠正，现根据对一些厂矿情况的了解，通报下列各点，希各厂、矿研究参考，更好的掌握领导运动的进行。
    ㈠个别的新纪录出现不少，但总的生产任务没有完成。这主要的是生产管理的组织和制度还未改善。机器一厂发生这样的现象提醒我们：一方面珍视一个车间，一个班、组，一个人的新纪录，善于总结并推广到全厂各个角落，号召大家学习，造成厂矿新纪录运动的高潮。同时另一方面随着群众的发动，新纪录的出现，必须研究检讨和改进过去的管理制度，使之与群众的创造相结合，其直接的目的和主要标帜便是完成与超过预定的生产计划与生产任务，这样才能不使新纪录运动与生产计划及生产任务脱节。
    ㈡废品率较前增高，机器三厂十月份加工废品率百之七·四，铸件废品率百分之九·四六，九月份加工废品率百分之一·八五，铸件废品率百分之六，这虽是部分现象，却告诉我们在运动更深入一步的阶段中必须重视提高质量，任何只重数量和缩短工时，降低重量规格或提高消耗标准的现象，都是有害的和错误的，注意建立与健全严格的成品检查制度，才能使新纪录运动不致发生单纯追逐数量，不顾质量的偏向，并创造减少或消灭废品的纪录。
    ㈢不首先进行小型试验浪费很大，抚顺制钢场试炼锋钢，两次失败，第三次成功了。工人的积极性，钻研精神极为可嘉，锋钢炼成功，有很大的意义和价值。但因事先没注意小型试验，两次失败损失了二十多亿。值得我们今后注意；当对于新的创造发明没有把握时，应进行小规模的试验，成功后取得经验再从事正规生产。
    ㈣盲目的创造新纪录。化工厂电解部工友为了创造新纪录，把曹达灰和盐酸，同时加入容器（此工作在进行时化工厂领导立即纠正了），企求电解速度加快，但实际上两者相遇，立即中和，失去作用，浪费了原材料。这是工友有热情而缺乏技术理论指导，没有进行学习的表现。因此我们即应加强组织职工对于理论知识业务技能的学习研究，使全体职工在新纪录运动中提高一步。
    ㈤加班现象增加，化工局锦西硬化油厂十月加班费较过去增加一倍，厂方规定加班要经过厂部批准，但工人为了创造新纪录，情绪高涨，现场不能掌握。其他厂也有工人夜里值宿，白天仍继续工作，不肯休息。这些虽然出自工人的热情积极，但为了保持有经常持久的新纪录，应爱护关心工人的健康，各厂矿应保证正常工时的紧张工作和严格的劳动纪律，但不要任意加班。
    以上各厂在创新纪录运动中是有很大成绩的，个别偏向在目前运动中是个别现象。其产生的原因是各厂领导干部的注意力，只注意到创新纪录中一点一面的问题，而未抓住新纪录的全面。为了引起各级领导干部重视，并避免重复错误，使运动更好的展开，特综合通报。各厂矿绝不能因此而影响领导上小手小脚，束缚运动，更不能作为不搞运动的借口。在新纪录运动中倘发现何种偏向，应随时反映，并提出改进意见。
