Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 12th: To strengthen railway communication and meet the needs of increasingly heavy transportation tasks, the Ministry of Railways has ordered the Northern Railway Bureaus and the Shanghai Railway Bureau to conduct a thorough maintenance of all railway telephone and telegraph lines before December 10th. (Note: Maintenance is a regular repair work aimed at maintaining a certain quality of the line.) The order pointed out that the telephone and telegraph lines of the railways within the customs were dilapidated due to years of disrepair before liberation. Since liberation, thanks to the efforts of the electrical workers of various railway bureaus over the past six months, the minimum equipment for long-distance return lines and dedicated communication for train operation has been completed successively. However, because the maintenance personnel have been busy with new projects, the maintenance of the original lines has been very poor. The newly built lines were also completed in a rush, and there is a common problem of only seeking temporary communication, regardless of the quality. As a result, the average number of communication failures in August reached fourteen per thousand kilometers (while in the Northeast, where communication work is done well, it was only one or two). This greatly reduced the efficiency of railway operation and wasted a lot of manpower and electricity. In order to complete this maintenance task, the order pointed out that it is necessary to oppose the conservative idea that communication was possible without maintenance in the past, as well as the phenomenon of perfunctory behavior under the pretext of difficulties in materials, tools, and manpower. All railway bureaus should actively persuade electrical workers to do their best to solve difficulties such as materials and tools, and implement a responsibility system for electrical work to eliminate the phenomenon that no one is responsible for the maintenance of communication equipment.

    铁道部通令整修线路
    各路局应发动员工克服困难认真贯彻电务工作负责制度
    【新华社北京十二日电】铁道部为加强铁路通信工作，以适应日渐加重的运输任务的需要，顷限令北方各路局和上海路局于十二月十日以前，对铁道电话、电报全局和上海路局于十二月十日以前，对铁道电话、电报全部线路进行一次澈底的维修（按：维修是一种经常性的修整工作，目的是维持线路的一定的质量），把现有线路的质量提高一步。命令指出：关内铁路电话、电报的线路，解放前年久失修，残破不堪。解放以后，经各路局电务员工半年来的努力修建，长途回线和行车专用通信的最低设备虽已先后完成，但由于维修人员忙于新工，对原有线路的维修工作做得很差。新修线路也由于是抢修完成的，普遍存在着只求临时能通话，不管质量好坏的毛病。因此通讯发生障碍的事故，八月份每一千公里平均达十四件（在通讯工作做得好的东北则仅为一、二件）。这大大地降低了铁路运转的效率，浪费了很多人力电力。为完成这次维修任务，命令指出：必须反对那种认为过去不维修一样通话的保守思想，以及借口材料、工具、人力困难敷衍塞责的现象。各路局应积极说服电务员工，尽最大努力解决材料、工具等困难，并贯彻电务工作上的负责制，消灭通信设备无人负责维修的现象。
