Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 20th: The full text of the Manifesto of the Democratic Faction of the Chinese Kuomintang Representative Meeting is as follows:

　　The Representative Meeting of the Democratic Faction of the Chinese Kuomintang, after five days of discussion starting from November 12th of this year, passed the resolution on the current political tasks of the party, passed the amendment to the party's organizational general charter, elected the Central Committee, and established the All-Party Unity Committee, initially completing the task of uniting the entire party. From today onwards, the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, and the San Min Chu I Comrades Association, the Chinese Kuomintang Democratic Promotion Association, and other democratic elements within the party, which had already been declared merged into this association by the Second Plenary Session of this association, are all united within a unified organization—the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, inheriting Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary tradition, proclaiming the demise of the traitor Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary party rule, and as a member of the Chinese People's Democratic United Front, under the leadership of Chairman Mao of the Chinese Communist Party, strive to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship and realize the Common Program of the People's Political Consultative Conference.

　　In the historical process of China's revolution over the past century, Mr. Sun Yat-sen's great advocacy unfolded the Chinese national democratic revolutionary movement, and he founded this party, personally leading and constantly struggling. In particular, Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary thought and revolutionary propositions often conformed to the laws of historical development and adapted to the objective situation of the revolution. More than twenty years ago, his revolutionary thought and revolutionary propositions had already developed from the old Three Principles of the People to the revolutionary Three Principles of the People, from opposing the Manchu Qing Dynasty and opposing autocracy to opposing imperialism and feudalism and the Three Great Policies. If Mr. Sun Yat-sen were still alive today, the theory and policies of the party he led would certainly further develop to adapt to the objective needs of the Chinese revolution. This is beyond doubt.

　　When China was in the historical stage of transitioning from the old democratic revolution to the new democratic revolution, Mr. Sun Yat-sen unfortunately passed away. The traitor Chiang Kai-shek, through his sneaky and thieving methods, hijacked Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary legacy and betrayed Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary teachings, turning the originally glorious Chinese Kuomintang into a tool for imperialism, feudal forces, and the subsequently gradually grown bureaucratic capitalism to oppress the people, causing the victory of the Chinese revolution to be delayed for more than twenty years. Although from this time onwards, there were revolutionary factions within the party who adhered to Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary line and confronted the counter-revolutionaries, they still had many weaknesses of the old society and could not withstand the cruel suppression of the counter-revolutionaries headed by Chiang Kai-shek, and as a result, they were inevitably defeated. In particular, the development of the objective situation of the revolution demonstrated that the guarantee of victory for the Chinese national democratic revolution was that its leadership must be built on the Chinese Communist Party, which united the broad masses of workers and peasants. If the revolutionary faction of the Chinese Kuomintang wanted to inherit Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary tradition and was willing to contribute its strength to the Chinese revolution, it could only participate in the People's Democratic United Front led by the Chinese Communist Party.

　　We, the democratic faction of the Chinese Kuomintang, gradually understood this characteristic of the development of the Chinese revolutionary situation from the lessons of repeated failures in the struggle against the counter-revolutionaries. Especially during the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, when Chiang Kai-shek surrendered to American imperialism, destroyed democracy, undermined peace, and slaughtered the people by any means, the San Min Chu I Comrades Association and the Chinese Kuomintang Democratic Promotion Association were both established during this time. Other democratic elements within the party who did not participate in open Kuomintang democratic faction organizations but sympathized with the People's Democratic United Front led by the CCP or engaged in undermining the reactionary regime with practical actions gradually increased from this time onwards. Only then did we embark on the correct path of the Chinese revolution.

　　In the process of fighting against the counter-revolutionary forces, although we were all conducting the life-and-death struggle to overthrow the traitorous and dictatorial regime under the call and influence of the People's Democratic United Front led by the CCP; and were completely consistent in spirit and basically the same in political views. However, due to environmental and historical reasons, and difficulties in work, we were still unable to unite within one organization. Now the People's Liberation War has destroyed the traitorous and dictatorial regime of the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group, and the People's Republic of China has been proclaimed. In the future, the People's Democratic United Front needs every democratic class and democratic party to concentrate their efforts to exert their strength in assisting the People's Government in carrying out the great New Democratic construction project. We should seize this great opportunity to carry out our great unity work. This is the significance of convening this conference of the Democratic Faction of the Chinese Kuomintang.

　　The basic task of the People's Democratic United Front in the new stage is to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, realize the Common Program of the People's Political Consultative Conference, and build a New Democratic China. As a member of the Chinese People's Democratic United Front, we should be faithful executors of this task. Therefore, the Common Program of the People's Political Consultative Conference is our general program of action. We will stand on our own posts, dedicate our wisdom and loyalty, and assist the people's governments at all levels, according to our historical and social relations, to thoroughly realize it. At the same time, in order to fully accomplish this task, we should strengthen the organization of our party as much as possible, transform the thinking and work style of our party members, so that the party organization is no longer a backward and loose group, but a progressive, disciplined revolutionary political party closely connected with the masses and serving the people. We do not seek the quantity of our party members, but the purity of their quality; the scope of development is not wide but seeks to adapt to the needs of construction in the New Democratic stage. We must ensure that every party member can recognize the times, recognize the truth, replace individualism with collectivism, replace subjective prejudice with a spirit of cooperation, learn Mr. Sun Yat-sen's spirit of progress and creation, learn Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and learn the clean, simple, arduous, and critical and self-critical work style of our friendly parties. In addition, although the enemies of the revolution have been basically defeated by the people's forces, they have not been completely wiped out. Those remaining reactionary forces, still under the instructions of American imperialism, are attempting to make a final struggle, and also want to carry out their sabotage conspiracies within our People's regime. We should not only rectify our ranks and raise our vigilance, but also, within our capacity, use our historical and social relations to assist the government in further eliminating the remaining forces of the reactionaries, and strive to bring those who may be awakened to the people's side. This is also work that we can do and should do.

　　We shout:
　　1. Unite all democratic elements of the party!
　　2. Carry forward Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary spirit!
　　3. Strengthen the party's organization and correct the party's work style!
　　4. Consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship and realize the Common Program of the CPPCC!
　　5. Support the international peace and democracy front headed by the Soviet Union!
　　6. Strive to consolidate the People's Democratic United Front under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao!
　　7. Long live the People's Republic of China!

### 中国国民党民主派代表会议宣言

　　中国国民党民主派代表会议宣言
    【新华社北京二十日电】中国国民党民主派代表会议宣言全文如下：
    中国国民党民主派代表会议从本年十一月十二日起，经过五天的讨论，通过了本党当前政治任务的决议案，通过了本党组织总章的修正案，选举了中央委员会，产生了全党团结委员会，初步完成全党团结的任务。从今天起，中国国民党革命委员会，和早经本会二中全会宣告合并于本会的三民主义同志联合会、中国国民党民主促进会以及党内其他民主分子，都团结在一个统一组织——中国国民党革命委员会之内，继承中山先生之革命传统，宣告叛徒蒋介石反动党统之灭亡，并以中国人民民主统一战线之一员，在中国共产党毛主席领导之下，为巩固人民民主专政，实现人民政协共同纲领而努力。
    在近百年来中国革命的历史过程中，中山先生的伟大倡导，展开了中国民族民主革命运动，并创建本党，躬亲领导，不断奋斗。尤其是中山先生的革命思想和革命主张，常能符合着历史发展规律，适应着革命客观形势。在二十余年前，他的革命思想和革命主张，即已由旧三民主义发展到革命的三民主义，由反满清反专制发展到反帝反封建和三大政策。假使中山先生仍健在于今日，他所领导的党的理论和政策，必更进一步的向前发展，以适应中国革命之客观需要。这是无可置疑的。
    当中国正由旧民主革命转向新民主革命的历史阶段中，中山先生不幸逝世，叛徒蒋介石以其鼠窃狗偷之手段，劫持了中山先生的革命遗产，背叛了中山先生的革命遗教，使原有光荣传统的中国国民党，变成了帝国主义、封建势力及以后逐渐长成的官僚资本主义压迫人民的工具，致使中国革命的胜利延滞了二十余年。虽然从这时起党内即有坚持中山先生革命路线与反革命派对抗的革命派产生，但以本身尚存有不少旧社会的弱点，又敌不过以蒋介石为首的反革命派的残酷镇压，结果都不免于失败。特别是革命客观情势的发展，说明了中国民族民主革命胜利的保证，其领导权必须建筑在团结了广大工农群众的中国共产党的身上，中国国民党革命派如果为了承继中山先生的革命传统，而愿为中国革命贡献其力量，唯有参加以中国共产党为首的人民民主统一战线。
    我们中国国民党民主派，于历次与反革命派斗争失败的教训里面，逐渐了解到这一中国革命情势发展中的特点，尤其是抗日战争胜利，蒋介石投降美帝，摧毁民主，破坏和平，屠杀人民无所不用其极的时候，三民主义同志联合会和中国国民党民主促进会，都在这时候先后产生。其余没有参加公开的国民党民主派组织而对于中共领导的人民民主统一战线，寄与同情或以实际行动从事瓦解反动政权工作的党内民主分子，从这时候起亦日渐增加。至此，我们才走上了中国革命的正确道路。
    在与反革命势力搏斗的过程中，虽然我们都在中共领导的人民民主统一战线的号召和影响之下，进行着出死入生打倒卖国独裁政权的斗争；且在精神上完全一致，在政见上基本相同。但因为环境和历史的关系，以至于工作上的困难，使我们仍无法统一于一个组织之内。现在人民解放战争，已将蒋介石反动集团的卖国独裁政权摧毁了，中华人民共和国已宣告诞生了，今后人民民主统一战线，正需要每一民主阶层和民主党派集中力量以发挥其协助人民政府，进行伟大的新民主主义的建设工程，我们应当把握这一大好时机，进行我们的大团结工作，这便是此次中国国民党民主派会议召开的意义。
    人民民主统一战线在新阶段中的基本任务，是巩固人民民主专政，实现人民政协共同纲领，建设新民主主义的新中国。作为中国人民民主统一战线之一员的我们，应该是这一任务的忠实执行者。因此，人民政协的共同纲领，便是我们行动的总纲领。我们将站在自己的岗位上，竭智尽忠，依据自己的历史的和社会的关系，协助各级人民政府，求其彻底实现。同时为了圆满达成这一任务，我们应尽可能健全我们党的组织，改造我们党员的思想和作风，务使党的组织不再是一个落后的散漫的集团，而是一个进步的有纪律的并与群众密切联系的为人民服务的革命政党。我们的党员，不求其量之多，而求其质之纯；发展的范围，不求其宽广而求其适应新民主主义阶段中的建设需要。务使每一党员都能认识时代，认识真理，以集体主义，代替个人主义，以协作精神代替主观偏见，学习中山先生进步和创造的精神，学习马列主义和毛泽东思想，学习我们的友党廉洁朴素、坚苦卓绝和批评、自我批评的作风。此外，革命的敌人虽然已在基本上被人民力量打垮了，却尚未全部肃清，那些反动派残余势力，仍在美帝的指使之下，企图作最后的挣扎，而且还想在我们人民政权辖区内进行其破坏阴谋。我们不仅应该整肃我们的阵营，提高我们的警觉，还应该在力所能及的范围内，运用我们历史的和社会的关系，协助政府，进一步肃清反动派的残余力量，并争取其中可能觉悟的分子到人民方面来，这也是我们可能做而又应该做的工作。
    我们高呼：
    １　全党民主分子团结起来！
    ２　发扬中山先生的革命精神！
    ３　健全党的组织，改正党的作风！
    ４　巩固人民民主专政，实现政协共同纲领！
    ５　拥护以苏联为首的国际和平民主阵线！
    ６　在中国共产党和毛主席领导之下为巩固人民民主统一战线而奋斗！
    ７　中华人民共和国万岁！
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　一九四九年十一月十六日
