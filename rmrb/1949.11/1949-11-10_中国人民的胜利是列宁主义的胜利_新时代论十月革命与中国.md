　　The Victory of the Chinese People is the Victory of Leninism
    ——A New Era on the October Revolution and China
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 9th] Moscow Dispatch: The recently published forty-sixth issue of "New Times" magazine contains an article by Zhukov entitled "The Great October Socialist Revolution and China." The author points out: The victory of the Chinese people is the victory of Leninism, the victory of the great ideas of Lenin and Stalin—the ideas of the October Revolution. The Chinese working class under the leadership of the Communist Party, relying on the existence of the Soviet Union, taking advantage of the further deepening of the general crisis of capitalism after the Second World War, the defeat of imperialist Japan, and the weakening of imperialism, led the peasants and working people and other strata, consolidated its leadership in the revolution, and achieved a historically significant victory—the establishment of a people's democratic system. The capitalist world has been forced to abandon significant territory in both Europe and Asia. The example of China provides particularly eloquent evidence of how vast a mass of people the great October Revolution awakened, how profound the strata that have been awakened to live a conscious, creative, and free life, and how enormous the forces that support socialism, democracy, and peace are.

　　中国人民的胜利是列宁主义的胜利
    ——新时代论十月革命与中国
    【新华社北京九日电】莫斯科讯：最近出版的第四十六期“新时代”杂志载有儒科夫的一篇题为“伟大的十月社会主义革命与中国”的文章。作者指出：中国人民的胜利，是列宁主义的胜利，是列宁、斯大林伟大思想——十月革命思想的胜利。共产党领导下的中国工人阶级，凭着苏联存在这一事实，利用第二次世界大战后资本主义总危机的进一步加深、帝国主义日本的失败和帝国主义的削弱，领导了农民和劳动人民以及其他阶层，巩固其在革命中的领导地位，并获得了有历史意义的胜利——建立了人民民主制度。资本主义世界在欧洲与亚洲都被迫放弃了重大的地盘。中国的例子提供了一个特别雄辩的证据，证明伟大的十月革命唤醒了何等广大的群众，证明那些已被唤起去过自觉的、创造性的与自由的生活的阶层是多么深广，证明拥护社会主义，民主与和平的力量是何等的巨大。
