The Beijing-Hankou Railway Reaches Xingtai

[Reported by this newspaper] After the Fourth Detachment of the Railway Corps successively invested in the repair of the Shi (Jiazhuang)-An (Yang) section of the Beijing-Hankou Railway on September 25th, all commanders and fighters began intense work. In order to respond to the call of Minister of Railways Teng Daiyuan: "Restore traffic on all northern lines by the end of this year!", after the commencement of the project, all difficulties were overcome, and quantity and quality were gradually improved. The 28th Battalion of the Detachment, which was responsible for repairing the line, increased its daily progress from 1,300 meters to 4.4 kilometers with the concerted efforts of all commanders and fighters, and created a new record of repairing 2,800 meters in four hours. The average daily progress has exceeded the original plan (2 kilometers per day) by more than 100%. Now the line has been repaired to Xingtai Station, and the section between Shijiazhuang and Xingtai has been opened to traffic.

The 24th Battalion of the Detachment, which was responsible for repairing bridges and culverts, was able to complete its tasks ahead of schedule each time, repairing 133 bridges and culverts under 20 meters and 6 large bridges over 20 meters. When repairing the Huai River Bridge, a warm revolutionary competition was launched among the companies. A certain company of the First Company installed 60 large wooden beams weighing more than 800 kilograms in less than a day. The Fourth Bridge Battalion, which started work on October 6, has repaired 8 large bridges over 20 meters.

A certain company in charge of communication and water supply engineering has repaired the temporary direct water supply projects for Gaoyi, Fengcun, and Xingtai stations. In terms of communication, the communication and signal engineering of eleven stations between Shijiazhuang and Xingtai has been completed. When digging electric pole pits, they braved the winter wind and stood in the knee-deep mud to work.

The masses along the line, seeing the hard-working spirit of the troops, women voluntarily organized sewing and washing teams to help the troops wash and sew clothes. With the close unity between the army and the people and the enthusiastic support of the masses, more than 50% of the repair project on the Shi-An section has been completed. Now a part of the Detachment has moved south from Xingtai to prepare to repair northward from Anyang.

　　京汉铁路修抵邢台
    【本报讯】铁道兵团四支队从九月廿五日先后投入抢修京汉铁路石（门）安（阳）段后，全体指战员即开始了紧张的工作。为了响应铁道部滕代远部长：“在本年年底北方各线恢复通车！”的号召，工程开始后，克服一切困难，在数量与质量上逐渐提高。担任抢修线路的该支二十八大队，在全体指战员一致努力下，每日进度由一三○○公尺提高到四公里四百公尺，并创造了四小时抢修二八○○公尺的新纪录，每日平均的进度已超过原计划（每日两公里）的百分之一百强。现在线路已修抵邢台站，石门邢台间已经通车。
    担任抢修桥涵的该支二十四大队，每次均能提前完成任务，修好二○公尺以下的桥梁涵洞达一三三座，二○公尺以上的大桥六座。抢修淮河桥时，各连队间展开了热烈的革命竞赛。一中队某连不到一天就上好了八百多斤重的大木梁六十根。第四桥梁大队于十月六日开工后，已修好二○公尺以上的大桥八座。
    担任通讯给水工程的某中队，已经修好高邑、冯村、邢台三个站的临时直接给水工程。通讯方面，已完成石门邢台间十一个站的通讯号志工程。他们挖电柱坑时，冒着冬季的寒风，站到深没膝盖的泥水里进行工作。
    沿线群众，看到部队这种艰苦奋斗的工作精神，妇女自动的组织缝洗队，帮部队洗缝衣服。在军民紧密团结与群众热烈的支援下，石安段的抢修工程已经完成百分之五十强。现该支队一部已经由邢台南下，准备从安阳向北抢修。
