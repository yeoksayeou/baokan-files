　　Beijing Municipal Trade Union Notifies Factories on Epidemic Prevention
　　[Our Dispatch] The preparatory committee of the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions has recently notified all factories to rigorously carry out epidemic prevention work. The notification stated in brief: Factories are places where the population is concentrated and are most susceptible to infectious diseases. In order to prevent plague, the factory trade unions and administration should jointly lead workers in epidemic prevention. The trade union's labor protection department is responsible for planning, supervising, and inspecting, and must complete the following tasks: 1. Clean up the factory and workers' dormitories, and pay attention to the hygiene of the surrounding environment at all times, mobilizing everyone to eliminate rats and fleas. 2. Do not allow outsiders to stay in the workers' dormitories, especially those from plague-stricken areas. 3. The factory clinics should immediately contact the health bureau, regularly study and inspect the epidemic prevention work. 4. If workers and their families are sick, they should immediately go to the clinic or designated hospital for treatment. 5. The labor protection department and the propaganda and education department should cooperate to carry out propaganda and education among the workers based on the materials from the People's Daily and the Worker's Daily in recent days and in the future, so that everyone recognizes the severity of the plague and understands the methods of prevention, creating a mass movement for epidemic prevention among the workers. 6. Always pay attention to the notices from the central and municipal epidemic prevention committees in the newspapers, and earnestly discuss and implement issues related to the factory. 7. Private factories with poor sanitation facilities on weekdays should pay special attention to this issue. The trade union should study it carefully with the factory and work together to do a good job.
