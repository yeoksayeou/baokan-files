　　Beijing Clothing Factory Winter Uniform Production
  　Quantity and Quality Universally Improved; Saving Over Two Thousand Bolts of Cloth
    [Beijing News] The Beijing Clothing Factory convened a summary conference for the second phase of winter uniform production on the afternoon of the 28th. Attending were 880 representatives from the Party, government, labor union, and Youth League branches of each sub-factory. Factory Director Li Zuobin reported on the factory's production and conservation achievements, stating that the quantity and quality of the second phase of winter uniform production had universally improved. Worker Wang Jinfu of the cotton batting department modified the roller shaft of the cotton batting machine, increasing the output of each machine by 15 catties of batting per hour. During the entire winter uniform production process, a total of 928 bolts of yellow plain cloth, 12 bolts of gray plain cloth, 1,492 bolts of white cloth, 2,514,200 yards of yellow thread, 340 sewing machine needles, and 225 gallons of gasoline were saved. Furthermore, there were significant achievements in conserving materials and supplies, such as using iron sheets to replace nails and using old bricks to replace cement. After the second phase of production, each unit used a democratic evaluation method to select a total of 1,314 labor models, accounting for 36% of the factory's workforce. The factory has issued them material rewards (grain) and medals. Finally, Factory Director Li emphasized: The People's Liberation Army is moving towards regularization. The lack of standardized uniforms has an impact on the regularization of the army. In the future, we should combine political study to continuously strive to improve our technology.

　　京被服厂冬装生产
  　数质量普遍提高　节约布二千余匹
    【北京讯】北京被服厂于二十八日下午召开第二期冬装生产总结大会，出席的有各分厂党、政、工、团代表八百八十余人，由厂长李作斌报告该厂生产节约成绩，说明二期冬装生产的量和质普遍提高，弹花部工友王金福更改造了弹花机帘轮轴，使每台机的产量每小时增弹十五斤花。在整个冬装生产过程中，共节余了黄平布九百二十八匹，灰平布十二匹，白布一千四百九十二匹，黄线二百五十一万四千二百余码，机针三百四十根，汽油二百二十五加仑。此外工料节约方面也有很大成绩，例如利用铁片代替钉子，利用旧砖代替洋灰等等。在第二期生产结束后，各单位用民主评定方式共选出劳动模范一千三百一十四名，占全厂人数百分之三十六。厂方已分别发给他们实物奖（粮食）和奖章。最后李厂长强调指示：解放军已走向正规化，没有标准化的制服对正规化的军队是有影响的，今后我们更应当结合政治学习来不断地努力提高技术。
