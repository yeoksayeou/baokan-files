　　Strengthening Urban-Rural Material Exchange and Opening Up Sales Channels for Industrial Products
  　All Circles Praise the Tianjin Industrial Exhibition
    Opening Ceremony Rescheduled for Today
    [Our Newspaper] Following the industrial exhibitions held in Beijing and Dalian, the Tianjin Industrial Exhibition will soon meet the broad masses of people. This will be a review of the strength of Tianjin's industrial production in the ten months since liberation. As Mayor Huang Jing praised when he visited the pre-exhibition: "Coming here not only broadens one's horizons but also strengthens one's confidence in our nation."
    When people saw the technical improvements and inventions of more than 200 products in the Industrial Improvement Hall during the pre-exhibition, and how they saved the country more than 100 million catties of millet, and saw the achievements created by China's long-oppressed working class, including manual and mental laborers, under the conditions of extremely scarce technical experimental equipment and guidance, they were extremely happy.
    Many people looked forward to the future of Tianjin's and China's industrial construction from the Tianjin Industrial Exhibition. Liu Zaisheng, director of the Industry Department of the Tianjin Military Control Commission, pointed out that Tianjin is located at the intersection of the Beijing-Shenyang and Tianjin-Shanghai railways, backed by the vast and resource-rich North China Plain, and relies on the five rivers connecting Bohai Bay and the North China hinterland, so it can develop into a large industrial zone in North China. Zhang Duoshan, another person in the industrial circle, further described such a picture: Taking Tianjin as the center, gradually expanding, connecting Kailuan in the east, and more closely linked with the Northeast, relying on Dezhou, Shijiazhuang, and Shanxi in the southwest to communicate remotely, gradually gathering and forming a single piece. Another industrialist, Zi Yaohua, therefore proposed to Tianjin's industrial circles to serve the people wholeheartedly and move towards the road of domestic raw materials and actual sales in rural areas. He explained that only when industry faces the countryside and the people can it achieve real development.
    Rural labor heroes, production models, and activists from the vast countryside will, in the process of visiting the industrial exhibition, conduct on-the-spot investigations into what things Tianjin industry, liberated for ten months, provides to the countryside, and then understand the needs of urban industry, so as to determine the direction of their future agricultural production. In rural areas, the most important thing is still the need for new agricultural tools, fertilizers, insecticides, etc. They hope that new agricultural tools will come to the countryside to replace their old equipment, and at the same time hope that the city can supply them with coal or charcoal-powered tillage machines to replace the livestock power that is very lacking in rural areas. Liu Tao, manager of the Hengshui Special District Agency Store, said that he would visit agricultural tool manufacturing plants to learn how to imitate new agricultural tools in order to supply them to the countryside in large quantities. For some simple machines such as oil presses, cotton gins, flour mills, rice mills, and water pumps, etc. Representatives from various places also brought a lot of their own crystallization products to participate in the industrial exhibition, such as Caoxian Special District bringing straw braid, leather nitrate, fire nitrate, shoe soles, Shimen Special District bringing self-made leather shafts, fine leather, felt shoes, and fur, Dingxian Special District bringing medicinal materials produced in mountainous areas, Tangshan Special District has various kinds of ores and gypsum, asbestos, and Baoding brought some mica, cattails, and willow bags. These will be concrete explanations of urban-rural material exchanges.
    Engineers, workers, and factory directors and managers who run enterprises have put forward many specific opinions on the industrial exhibition. Yao Yimei, an engineer from the new port, cited the example of the close contact between the engineering community and the business community in solving the raw material problem in the construction of the new port project, hoping that through the industrial exhibition, various industrial departments and enterprise construction departments can understand each other's capabilities and needs, more closely unite and cooperate, and accelerate the economic construction of new democracy. The workers in the watch repair shop of the water plant enthusiastically guaranteed that the workers would work hard for the construction of rural mechanization and electrification. Ji Bingduo, a worker in the automobile repair shop, proposed to produce more and invent new and suitable agricultural tools to improve rural productivity and produce more cotton and grain, and realize mutual assistance between workers and peasants and develop production. Liu Chunnian, an old worker who has worked for the tram company for 25 years, welcomed farmer representatives to visit the tram company. Li Hepu, a staff member of the automobile manufacturing and distribution plant, hoped that the farmer representatives would use scientific methods to improve agriculture after visiting the industrial exhibition. Yu Shizhong, a worker at China Textile Factory No. 3, hoped that the technologies of various factories would be made public for comparison and research, learning from each other's strengths and overcoming past conservatism. Here the workers showed their great class brotherhood and enthusiasm for building the motherland.
    [Our Newspaper] The Tianjin Industrial Exhibition was originally scheduled to be held on the 3rd, but because it rained in the morning of that day, some of the exhibits were damaged by water and had to be modified, so it was temporarily decided to hold the opening ceremony at 9:00 a.m. today (the 4th). After the ribbon-cutting at 10:00 a.m., the exhibition will be open. If it rains today, the decision will be made to continue postponing the event.

### 加强城乡物资交流打开工业产品销路　各界赞扬天津工展  开幕典礼改订今日举行

　　加强城乡物资交流打开工业产品销路
  　各界赞扬天津工展
    开幕典礼改订今日举行
    【本报讯】在北京和大连相继举行工展以后，天津工业展览会又将和广大的人民见面了。这将检阅解放后十个月来天津工业生产的力量。如黄敬市长在参观了工展的预展时所赞美的：“到这里看看，不但放大了眼界，对自己的民族更增强了信心。”
    当人们在预展时看到了工业改进馆的二百多种产品的技术改进和发明，因此为国家节省了一万万多斤小米，看到中国的一向受压迫的工人阶级包括体力劳动者和脑力劳动者，在技术实验设备和指导都十分贫乏的条件下所创造出来的这些成绩，他们是如何地高兴。
    许多人从天津的工展展望了天津的和中国的工业建设的前途。天津军管会工业处处长刘再生指出了天津位于京沈、津沪两铁路的交义点，背着广大的物产丰富的华北平原，凭倚着通联渤海和华北内地的五河，因此可以发展成为华北的大工业区。工业界另一人士张朵山更补充描绘了这样一幅图画，以天津为中心逐渐推广，东接开滦，和东北更密切联系起来，西南凭借德州、石家庄和山西遥遥相通，逐渐聚集，打成一片。另一工业界人士资耀华因此对津市工业界提出要彻底为人民大众服务，走向国货原料和实销农村的道路。他说明只有工业面向农村，面向人民，才能得到真正的发展。
    从广大农村中来的农村的劳动英雄，生产模范和积极分子，他们将要在参观工展过程中，实地考察解放了十个月的天津工业拿些什么东西供应农村，再来了解城市工业的需要，好决定他们未来农业生产的方向。在农村中，最主要的还是需要新式农具，肥料，除虫剂等。他们希望新式农具下乡来代替他们的旧家伙，同时希望城市能供给他们以燃煤或炭的耕力机来代替农村中很感缺乏的畜力。衡水专区机关商店经理刘涛表示他要参观农具制造厂，学习仿制新农具，以便大批供应农村。对于一些简单的机器如榨油机，弹棉机，磨粉机，碾米机，抽水机等。各地的代表们还带来他们生产的不少结晶品参加到工展会去，如沧县专区带来草帽辫、皮硝、火硝、鞋底，石门专区带着自制的皮轴、细皮、毡鞋和皮毛，定县专区带着山地产的药材，唐山专区有各式各样的矿石和石膏、石绵，保定带来一些云母、蒲草、柳条包。这些将是城乡物资交流的具体说明。
    工程师、工人和经营企业的厂长和经理，对于工展更提出了很多具体意见。新港工程师姚贻枚以建筑新港工程中工程界和企业界密切联系解决了原料问题的实例，希望通过工展，各工业部门和企业建设部门都能了解彼此的能力和需要，更密切地团结配合，加速新民主主义的经济建设。自来水厂修表房工人热情地保证工人将为农村的机械化、电气化的建设而努力，汽车修理厂的工人冀秉铎提出要多生产，多发明新的合用的农具，使农村的生产力提高，多产棉花，粮食，实现工农兄弟的互助，发展生产。电车公司做了二十五年的老工人刘春年欢迎农民代表来电车公司看看。汽车制配厂职员李和璞希望农民代表看过工展后用科学方法改善农业。中纺三厂的工人于世忠希望各厂的技术公开作个比较研究，互相取长补短，破除已往的保守主义。在这里工人们显出了他们伟大的阶级兄弟感情和建设祖国的热情。
    【本报讯】天津市工业展览会原定三日举行，但因是日晨一度落雨，部分展览品受到水渍，须加修改，故临时决定改于今（四日）晨九时举行开幕典礼。十时剪彩后，开放展览。如今日遇雨，决定继续延期举行。
