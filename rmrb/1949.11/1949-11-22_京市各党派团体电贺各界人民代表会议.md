　　　　　Democratic League Beijing Municipal Branch
　　[Beijing News] The Beijing Municipal Branch of the China Democratic League recently sent a congratulatory telegram to the Second Session of the Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference. The original telegram is as follows: To all the representatives of the Second Session of the Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference:
　　Thanks to the unprecedented great victory of the Chinese people, everyone has accomplished too much in the past year! And this conference is especially an unprecedented conference that the Chinese people have not held for thousands of years: the Chinese people have never elected the administrative head of their capital, nor have they decided on the capital's guidelines and policies. In the past, everything was controlled and dominated by the feudal comprador class. Even a village or a county has never held a "People's Representative Conference" to grant the people the right to exercise all of the above rights. Now, although these representatives are not produced through universal suffrage, these representatives are fully representative. These representatives will exercise the functions and powers of the Beijing Municipal "People's Congress," and we believe that they will surely complete this unprecedented great cause. At the same time, this conference is held under the leadership of the proletariat, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, and under the leadership of the wise leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, under the new democratic regime. This inevitably determines the nature of this conference. It is certain to represent the people and serve the people. This is the basic reason for the inevitable success of this conference and the greatest glory of all of you. Respectfully wish the conference success! Respectfully wish all the representatives good health!

　　　　China National Revolutionary Committee Beijing Municipal Preparation Committee, Beijing September 3rd Society
　　[Beijing News] The Beijing Municipal Preparation Committee of the China National Revolutionary Committee and the Beijing September 3rd Society jointly sent a congratulatory telegram to the Second Session of the Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference. The original telegram is as follows:
　　Second Session of the Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference: Today, when the National People's Political Consultative Conference has successfully concluded, the Central People's Government has been formally established, and the People's Liberation Army is about to achieve a complete victory throughout the country, eliminating revolutionary obstacles and beginning comprehensive construction, our city's two million people are honored to be the first to exercise our own political power, elect our own government, and discuss all matters of reform and construction, which is truly an event of great epoch-making historical significance.

  　　　　　国民党革命委员会京分会
    【北京讯】中国国民党革命委员会北京市分会电贺北京市第二届各界人民代表会议，原电如下：北京市第二届各界人民代表会议全体代表：
    在中央人民政府成立、共同纲领公布为时不久的今天，作为新中国首都的北京市，召开了第二届各界人民代表会议，首先实行了毛主席在上届会议时所指示的原则，亦即是共同纲领第二章第十四条“在普选的地方人民代表大会召开以前，由地方各界人民代表会议，逐步地代行人民代表大会职权”的规定，以选举的方式来产生新的北京市人民政府，为全国地方普选制树立了楷模；并实现了全市二百万人民更进一步的大团结。
    本会同人于欢欣鼓舞之余，当全心全意协助新政府，为建设繁荣的新北京而努力！

    【北京讯】中国民主同盟北京市支部顷电贺北京市第二届各界人民代表会议，原电如下：北京市第二届各界人民代表会议全体代表先生：
    由于中国人民的空前大胜利，大家在最近一年内所完成的事业，是太多了！而这一次会议尤其是中国人民几千年来所没有举行过的空前会议：中国人民向来没有选举过他们首都所在地的行政首长，也没有决定过首都的施政方针和政策，过去一切都被封建买办阶级所把持、所统制，即使一个村、一个县，也没有举行过“人民代表会议”赋予人民以行使以上种种的权利，现在这次的代表虽然还不是经过普选方式产生的，但是这些代表都是具有充分的代表性的。由这些代表，来执行北京市“人民代表大会”的职权，我们相信一定能完成这空前的伟大的事业。同时这一次会议，是在无产阶级领导之下，在中国共产党领导之下，在英明的中国人民领袖毛主席领导之下的新民主主义政权之下召开的，这就必然的规定着这一次会议的性质，他是一定能够代表人民，而为人民服务的，这是这次会议必然成功的基本原因，也是诸位先生最大的光荣。敬祝会议成功！敬祝诸位代表健康！
