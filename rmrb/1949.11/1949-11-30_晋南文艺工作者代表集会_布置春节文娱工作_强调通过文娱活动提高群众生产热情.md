[Shanxi News] In order to promote the upcoming Spring Festival cultural and entertainment activities, the southern Shanxi region recently convened a representative meeting of literary and art workers. Participants unanimously agreed that: (1) organizational leadership must be strengthened, with each county organizing a "Spring Festival Cultural and Entertainment Preparatory Committee," absorbing personnel from relevant departments to participate, deploying and promoting cultural and entertainment work throughout the county, and relying on village-level cadres, in conjunction with intellectuals, to unite folk artists and form village-level leadership organs; (2) each county can convene symposiums for artists to convey and deploy cultural and entertainment work, reform old artists, and require each county to create typical demonstrations during the New Year to promote the development of the movement. The meeting called on all literary and art workers to boldly create literary works such as plays, poems, ballads, and storytelling lyrics, with content that is realistic and forms that are diverse. The meeting also emphasized that through Spring Festival cultural and entertainment activities, mass enthusiasm for production should be enhanced, and a foundation should be laid for the development of cultural and entertainment work in southern Shanxi in the future.
