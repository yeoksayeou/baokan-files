About "Saving Mom Through Thrift"
    Sha Minghua
    On the People's Garden page of October 14th, there was a short poem titled "Saving Mom Through Thrift," attributed to "Sha Minghua, a fifteen-year-old female worker at the Renli Carpet Factory." I copied it from the supplement of the Tianjin Progress Daily on September 25th. The story is like this: In early October, my mother returned to Tianjin to visit our ancestors' graves, but all our family graves had been submerged in water. My mother was heartbroken when she told us about it. She also said that various places were launching campaigns to save disaster victims through thrift, and some families were unwilling to spend even a single penny. At the same time, because of the rain, the paper on the windows was broken, so we used old newspapers brought back from Tianjin to paste them up. Among them was a Progress Daily, which had the poem "Saving Mom Through Thrift." After I saw it, I had an incorrect idea: If I wrote it out for people to see, it would help the campaign to save disaster victims through thrift....
    Since it was published in the People's Daily, everyone has been praising me, and I slowly couldn't take it anymore. The more people praised me, the more sad I felt. On the 16th, when the People's Daily asked me to talk about it, I was so anxious that I couldn't speak. I really wanted to tell the facts in detail, but I didn't have the courage, like I had taken someone else's things and was afraid of being discovered. Now, I realize that articles also have ownership. Writing someone else's work with my own name is like taking someone else's things. Now I apologize to the original author of the poem and the newspaper editor, and completely overcome this dishonest behavior.

    Editor's Note: The original author of the poem is Comrade Si Qingke from the Daqing Factory in Hangu. After we published it, we received letters from readers pointing it out, and only then did we find out that this poem had been published in the supplement of the Tianjin Progress Daily on September 25th. This shows that we are not serious enough about our work (we didn't even look closely at the supplements of various newspapers in Beijing and Tianjin).
    Although it has been proven that this poem was not written by a "fifteen-year-old female worker," we still believe that it is a relatively good poem worth recommending.

### 关于“节约救妈妈”

　　关于“节约救妈妈”
    沙明华
    十月十四号人民园地上，登着一首“节约救妈妈”的短诗，署名是“仁立地毯厂十五岁女工沙明华”，是我在九月二十五号天津进步日报副刊上抄下来的。事情的经过是这样：十月初我母亲回到天津去上坟，可是我们底祖坟都已淹在水里，母亲回来说起好伤心，她还说现在各地方正发起节约救灾运动，有的人家还一个子儿都不愿意化。同时因为下雨，窗户上的纸都被打碎了，我们就把从天津带回来的旧报纸糊起来，中间有一张进步日报，就登着“节约救妈妈”这首诗，我看到以后，就起了一个不正确的想法：要是把它写给人看了，会对于节约救灾运动有帮助的……。
    自从人民日报上登出以后，大家都来夸奖我，我就慢慢的受不住了，人家越夸奖我，我就越觉得难过，到十六日那天，人民日报约我去谈谈，我就急得说不出话来，很想把事实详细的说出来，又觉得没有勇气，就象拿了人家的东西怕被人发觉似的。现在，我体会到文章也是有所有权的，把人家写的东西写上自己底名字，就好比拿了人家的东西一样，现在我向诗的原作者及报社编辑致歉，并澈底克服这种不老实的行为。    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    编者按：诗的原作者是汉沽大青工厂司青科同志，我们刊出后，经读者来信指责，才查出这诗已刊载于九月二十五日天津进步日报副刊，这说明了我们平时对工作的严肃不够　（连京津各报的副刊也未很好的看）。
    这诗虽已证明不是出自“十五岁女工”之手，但我们仍然认为这是一首值得推荐的比较好的诗。
