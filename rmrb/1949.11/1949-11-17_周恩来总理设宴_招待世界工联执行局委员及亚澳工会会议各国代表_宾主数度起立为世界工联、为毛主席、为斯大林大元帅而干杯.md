Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 16th. Premier Zhou Enlai of the Central People's Government Administration Council hosted a banquet at 6:30 this afternoon to entertain the members of the World Federation of Trade Unions Executive Bureau and delegates from various countries attending the Asian-Australasian Trade Union Conference. More than one hundred people, including Saillant, were invited to the banquet. Zhu De, Commander-in-Chief of the People's Liberation Army, Shen Junru, President of the Supreme People's Court, Vice Premiers of the Administration Council Dong Biwu, Chen Yun, Guo Moruo, Huang Yanpei and others were also present.

At the banquet, Premier Zhou delivered a welcoming speech, saying: "The arrival of the leaders of the World Federation of Trade Unions and workers' representatives from various countries is a great encouragement to the Chinese people. Twenty-two years ago, international friends came to China, but later, due to the obstruction of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, we were isolated. Today, the Chinese people have achieved victory, enabling us to reunite, and therefore we are particularly happy about the arrival of our international friends."

Premier Zhou said: "The arrival of representatives from various countries not only demonstrates the unity of the majority of the working class, but also the unity of the majority of the world's democratic forces. Let the imperialists tremble at our unity!"

Commander-in-Chief Zhu De, on behalf of all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, delivered a welcoming speech, saying: "You are all leaders of the trade union movements in various countries. With your leadership and participation, the Asian-Australasian Trade Union Conference will surely achieve brilliant success. At the same time, it will greatly contribute to safeguarding world peace, consolidating the unity of the international working class, striving for the liberation of the oppressed people of the East, and our common struggle against imperialist aggression and war-mongers."

President Shen Junru and Vice Premier Guo Moruo also delivered speeches successively. On the guest side, Louis Saillant (France), Soloviev (Soviet Union), Toledano (Latin America), Piñia (Cuba), Abdullah (Africa), L'heureux (France), Adlybish (Mongolia), Liu Defu (Vietnam), Shelvanker (India), Choi @duk (Korea) and others delivered speeches in response. In his speech, Saillant expressed great gratitude for the warm reception by the Chinese people, saying: "I have traveled through many countries in Europe, but I have never received such hospitality from any government." In their speeches, Soloviev and others praised the achievements of the Chinese people in their heroic struggle against imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries. Workers' representatives from various Asian colonial countries said in their speeches that the victory of the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle has set a good example for the people of the colonies under imperialist rule.

During the banquet, the hosts and guests repeatedly rose to toast the World Federation of Trade Unions, the leader of the Chinese people Chairman Mao, and the great teacher of all mankind Marshal Stalin.
