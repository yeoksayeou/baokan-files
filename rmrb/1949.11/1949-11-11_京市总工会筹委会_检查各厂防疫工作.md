    Beijing Municipal Trade Union Preparatory Committee
    Inspects Epidemic Prevention Work in Factories
    [Beijing News] The Beijing Municipal Trade Union Preparatory Committee dispatched epidemic prevention inspection teams on the 8th of this month to inspect epidemic prevention work at four factories: Beijing General Machinery Factory, Tram Company, Yanjing Paper Mill, and Renli Carpet Company. The inspection results showed that the Beijing General Machinery Factory's work was better. The factory formed an epidemic prevention committee composed of Party, government, and labor representatives, with the factory director serving as the director of the committee, leading the work. Most workers have realized the importance of epidemic prevention, and everyone has prepared masks. They have also generally cleaned the environment, spread lime, and blocked rat holes. Except for a few sick individuals, all 2,960 employees and their families in the factory have been vaccinated twice. The gatekeepers are very strict, and workers and visitors who have not been vaccinated are not allowed to enter the factory. Yanjing Paper Mill was second best. The factory also carried out a major cleaning, blocked rat holes, and carried out two vaccinations. Although the Tram Company and Renli Carpet Company had made some arrangements, they had not followed up and inspected closely. Vaccinations only began the day before yesterday. Rat-catching work has generally not been carried out. The dormitories of the Yanjing Paper Mill and some of the dormitories of the Tram Company's South Factory have too few windows and the ground is damp, so improvements should be made.

    京市总工会筹委会
    检查各厂防疫工作
    【北京讯】北京市总工会筹委会，本月八日派出防疫检查组分别到北京机器总厂、电车公司、燕京造纸厂、仁立地毯公司等四厂检查防疫工作。检查结果，以北京机器总厂工作较好，该厂由党、政、工组成防疫委员会，厂长任主任委员，领导工作，一般工人都已认识到防疫的重要性，每人都准备有口罩，并普遍进行了清理环境，铺撒石灰，堵塞鼠洞；除个别患病者外，全厂二千九百六十余职工和家属都注射了两次防疫苗；门岗检查很严，未经防疫注射的工人和来客一概不准进厂。燕京造纸厂次之，该厂亦进行过大扫除，堵塞了鼠洞，进行过两次防疫注射。电车公司、仁立地毯公司虽曾做了些布置。但未抓紧进行与检查，前天才开始注射。捕鼠工作一般都未进行，燕京造纸厂的舍宿和电车公司南厂一部分宿舍窗户太少，地面潮湿，应注意改进。
