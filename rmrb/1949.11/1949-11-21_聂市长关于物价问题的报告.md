[Beijing News] The full text of Mayor Nie Rongzhen's report on the price issue at the Second People's Representative Conference of Beijing on the 20th is as follows:

　　　　(1) Reasons for the Increase in Grain Prices

This increase in grain prices has greatly affected the lives of citizens. After reviewing the reasons, the main ones are the following four points:

1.  Most of the grain supply was blocked. In order to effectively support North China, the Northeast temporarily prohibited grain merchants from purchasing grain from October 15th; after the plague outbreak in the Northwest, traffic on the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway and Rehe Province was cut off, and the source was interrupted; at the same time, the southeast areas of Beijing were all disaster areas, and the grain originally supplied to Beijing was reduced due to the needs of the disaster areas themselves. Moreover, some people in the disaster areas, due to the shortage of grain in the disaster areas and high prices, even went to Beijing to buy grain.

2.  Due to the needs of the war, the government increased the amount of currency issued. At the same time, in order to prevent cotton farmers from suffering losses due to excessively low cotton prices, the government purchased a large amount of cotton in cotton-producing areas. After selling cotton, cotton farmers went to the market to buy grain, which led to an increase in grain prices in cotton-producing areas, which also affected the grain supply and grain prices in Beijing.

3.  Prices were stable in August and September. Since the beginning of October, when prices began to fluctuate, speculators seized the opportunity to invest floating capital in yarn, cloth, and grain, hoarding and refusing to sell, and driving up prices, hoping to make huge profits, artificially causing drastic fluctuations in grain prices.

4.  Due to the hoarding and refusal to sell by speculators, grain prices rose sharply, causing panic among the masses, and the phenomenon of people rushing to buy grain also contributed to the rise in grain prices.

　　　　(2) Government Measures

1.  Unblocking the Grain Supply: Increase the amount of grain purchased on the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway and strengthen transportation; the Northeast is also greatly increasing the transfer of grain to Beijing. At the same time, during the epidemic prevention period, the government actively assisted grain merchants in transporting grain stored in the Northwest to Beijing.

2.  Tightening Currency Circulation: All loans and investments of public and private enterprises are suspended except for special approvals, and the expenditures of various departments are delayed or reduced, and a portion of the business income tax and business tax are pre-collected to withdraw currency and reduce the amount of currency in circulation.

3.  From November 1st to 18th, our grain company supplied more than 27.16 million catties of grain (including wholesale and retail). In order to take care of the lives of citizens, the grain company has always sold at lower prices. For example, on November 19th, the wholesale price of flour from the grain company was 33,000 yuan per bag, and the retail price was 800 yuan per catty, while the price on the private market was about 50,000 yuan per bag and about 1,000 yuan per catty. Some speculators took the grain thrown into the market by the government to stabilize prices and supply citizens, and hoarded it, refused to sell it, or sold it at high prices, which aroused great dissatisfaction among the masses. Therefore, in addition to severely punishing speculators, we have decided to expand and strengthen grain retail work throughout the city, and directly supply food from the state-owned trading company to citizens. Currently, we are supplying to agencies, schools, factories, and working citizens, with a population of over 600,000, and we plan to expand to 1.2 million people. The number of retail stores is planned to increase from the existing 64 (including cooperatives) to 170. The supply of coal has also been decided to be resolved in the same way as grain.

4.  Since the price of grain began to fluctuate, the government has convened meetings with grain merchants several times, repeatedly explaining the price situation and the government's measures to stabilize prices. However, the speculators disregarded government laws and regulations and the lives of the people, and continued to hoard and drive up prices, which threatened the lives of the majority of citizens and made it very difficult for the operation of ordinary legitimate industries and businesses. We have received many letters from citizens complaining about the illegal activities of these speculators, and the masses hate these speculators to the bone. We accepted the requests of the masses and arrested sixteen speculators. Except for four whose circumstances were relatively minor and were released on bail, the remaining twelve have been sent to the court for punishment according to law.

The drastic fluctuations in grain prices have caused great damage to the general public, especially the working people. We underestimated this situation beforehand, and the preparatory work was not done well enough. We are responsible for the lack of strict management of the market and the failure to crack down on speculators. In addition to conducting a thorough review and taking the above measures, we should take this as a serious lesson. In the future, we will strive to ensure the supply of grain and coal needed by the people of Beijing so that there will be no shortage.

　　聂市长关于物价问题的报告
    【北京讯】聂荣臻市长在北京市第二届各界人民代表会议二十日的大会上关于物价问题的报告，全文如下：
    　　　　（一）粮价上涨原因
    这次粮价上涨，影响市民生活很大，检讨其原因主要的有以下四点：
    １、粮源大部阻塞。东北为了有计划的征粮购粮以便有效地支援华北，从十月十五日起，暂禁粮商前去购粮；西北自鼠疫发生后，京绥线及热河省交通断绝，来源中断；同时，京市东南各地区均系灾区，原来所能供给京市的粮食，亦均因灾区本身需要而减少，并且有些灾区的群众因灾区粮缺，及价格高，还有到京市买粮回去的现象。
    ２、由于战争需要，政府增加了一部分发行，与此同时，政府为使棉农不致因棉价过低而蒙受损失，在产棉区大量收购棉花，而棉农出售产棉以后，又到市场购买粮食，因而使产棉的地区粮价上升，从而亦影响了本市粮源及粮价。
    ３、八、九两月份物价平稳，十月初开始波动以来，一般奸商手中的游资即乘机投向纱布、粮食，囤积拒售哄抬物价，希冀牟取暴利，人为地使粮价发生猛烈波动。
    ４、由于奸商哄抬拒售，粮价猛然上涨，引起群众心理的恐慌，发生了群众争相抢购的现象，亦助长了粮价的上升。
    　　　　（二）政府措施
    １、疏导粮源：加强京绥线粮食收购的数量，并加强运输；东北方面亦大量增调粮食来京，同时，政府在防疫期间，积极协助粮商将西北存的粮食运京。
    ２、紧缩通货：公私营贷款投资除特殊批准者外，一律暂停，并缓发或减发各部门经费，预征营利事业所得税和营业税的一部，以回笼货币，减少通货的流通量。
    ３、从十一月一日到十八日，我粮食公司共供应粮食二千七百一十六万多斤（包括批发与零售）。粮食公司为了照顾市民生活，始终以较低价格出售，如十一月十九日粮食公司面粉批发价每袋三万三千元，零售价每斤八百元，而私人市场价格则每袋在五万元左右，每斤在一千元左右。一部分奸商把政府在市场抛出用来平稳物价，供应市民的粮食，拿去囤积拒售或高价出售，群众极为不满。因此，除严惩奸商外，我们决定在全市扩大与加强粮食零售工作，将国家贸易公司的食粮直接供应给市民。目前已在供应的机关、学校、工厂及劳动市民约在六十万人口以上，准备扩大到一百二十万人口。在零售店的数量上，拟从现有的六十四处（包括合作社在内）增至一百七十处。煤的供应亦决定采取与粮食同样的办法解决。
    ４、从粮价开始波动以来，政府曾几次召集粮商开会，一再解释物价情况及政府稳定物价的措施，但奸商丝毫不顾政府法令及人民生活，仍大肆囤积哄抬，致广大市民生活受到威胁，一般正当工商业的经营，亦感觉很大困难。我们接到不少市民的来信，控诉这些奸商的非法行为，群众对这些奸商是痛恨入骨的。我们接受群众要求，逮捕了十六家奸商，除其中情节较轻者四家取保释放外，其余十二家已送法院依法惩处。
    此次粮价的猛烈波动，对一般市民特别是劳动市民的损害是极大的。我们事先对此种情况估计不足，准备工作做得不够，对市场管理、奸商取缔不严，我们是应当负责的。除已作深刻检讨并采取以上各种措施外，应引为严重教训。今后当努力保证北京人民所需要粮、煤的供给，不使有所缺乏。
