Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 14th: TASS, New York, 12th: Soviet Representative Malik delivered a lengthy speech at the United Nations General Assembly Special Political Committee meeting on November 8th, discussing the international control of atomic energy. The main points are as follows:

Malik first pointed out that the work of the Atomic Energy Commission had already been suspended in May of this year due to the insistence of the US and British representatives. Later, at the Third Session of the General Assembly, the US and British representatives attempted to make a decision that would completely halt the activities of the commission. However, their conspiracy was exposed, and they had no choice but to agree to the commission resuming its work. However, the subsequent developments showed that this agreement was entirely superficial. The representatives of the US-British bloc greatly reduced the activities of the commission and rejected the proposals put forward by the Soviet delegation. These proposals demanded that, after the commission resumed its work, it should immediately begin drafting a convention on the prohibition of atomic weapons and a convention on the control of atomic energy, with both conventions being concluded and implemented simultaneously. The commission should submit the drafts of these two conventions to the Security Council on June 1, 1949. These Soviet proposals were opposed by the US and British representatives and rejected by the majority of the Atomic Energy Commission. The Soviet representative pointed out that judging from the content of the recent statements made by the representatives of the five participating countries, the next intention of the US-British bloc, in the final analysis, is still to first prevent reaching an agreement on declaring atomic weapons illegal, then declare the negotiations a failure, and blame the Soviet Union.

Malik said: As is well known, from the very beginning of the discussion on the use of atomic energy, the main difference between the US-British bloc and the Soviet Union and many countries that supported the Soviet Union's views has been the issue of the prohibition of atomic weapons. The Soviet government firmly believes that atomic energy should be used exclusively for peaceful purposes, to improve the welfare and living standards of the people of all countries, and to promote science and culture for the benefit of mankind. In sharp contrast, the US government has resisted the prohibition of atomic weapons by all means, trying to preserve the possibility of using atomic energy for combat. This attempt by the US government stems from the following erroneous idea: that atomic weapons may be the main means for the United States to achieve world hegemony.

    联大政委会讨论原子能问题
    苏代表马立克作重要发言
    痛斥美英反对禁用原子武器
    提议立即签订禁用和管制公约
    【新华社北京十四日电】塔斯社纽约十二日讯：苏联代表马立克在十一月八日讨论国际原子能管制问题联合国大会特别政治委员会会议上，作了长篇的发言，要点如下：
    马立克首先指明，由于美英代表的坚持，原子能委员会的工作，于今年五月就已经停顿。后来，在联大的第三届会议上，美英代表曾试图作出使该委员会完全停止活动的决定。然而，他们的阴谋被揭露了，他们不得已同意该委员会恢复工作。但是，后来情况的演变表明，这种同意完全是表面的。美英集团的代表们把委员会的活动大大加以缩小，并且拒绝苏联代表团所提出的建议。这些建议要求：委员会恢复工作后，应立即着手拟订禁止原子武器的公约草案和关于原子能管制的公约草案，两公约应同时缔结和实施。委员会应在一九四九年六月一日将这两个公约草案提交安理会。苏联的这些建议遭到美英代表的反对，并为原子能委员会的多数所否决。苏联代表指明：从参加商谈的五国代表最近发表的声明的内容判断，美英集团的下一步打算，归根结蒂还是首先阻止达成关于宣布原子武器非法的协议，然后宣布商谈失败，而归咎于苏联。
    马立克说：如所周知，从使用原子能问题的讨论一开始，美英集团与苏联及许多支持苏联意见的国家之间的主要分歧，即是禁止原子武器问题。苏联政府坚主原子能应专门用作和平目的，以提高各国人民的福利与生活标准，并为人类的利益而促进科学与文化。与此恰恰相反，美国政府则以一切办法抗拒禁止原子武器，力图保留利用原子能作战的可能性。美国政府的这种企图是从下述错误打算出发的，即原子武器可能是使美国取得世界霸权的主要手段。
