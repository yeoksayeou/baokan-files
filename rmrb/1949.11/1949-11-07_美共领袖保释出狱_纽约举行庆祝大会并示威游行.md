Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 6th: TASS, New York: The leaders of the American Communist Party received a warm welcome and celebration from the American people upon their release from prison and after their release. On the afternoon of the 3rd, when the ten leaders left the Foley Square courthouse after the Civil Rights Congress paid $260,000 in bail, they were warmly welcomed by the masses. The Black community of New York held a welcoming rally in the evening to celebrate the release of the American Communist leaders, followed by a demonstration of thousands of people. The procession was led by Davis, Winston, and Thompson, as well as the famous Black progressive singer Robeson, accompanied by many propaganda vehicles and cars. Davis, Winston, and Thompson delivered brief speeches at the welcoming rally. Davis said: "My bail is due to your strength. I have returned to fight for the rights of the people, and Medina (referring to the reactionary judge of the New York Federal Court who sentenced the American Communist leaders to imprisonment and fines and opposed their release on bail) cannot stop me." Robeson also delivered a speech.

After the meeting, a procession of thousands of people moved towards another building, where thousands more were waiting for Davis and other American Communist leaders to speak to them. The Harlem (name of the Black community in New York) police, notorious for their barbaric treatment of Black people, attempted to prevent the peaceful procession from advancing. However, the demonstrators ignored the police's threats, and the police arrested some of the demonstrators.
