　　Beijing Begins Collecting Autumn Property Tax
    [Beijing News] Beijing Municipality began collecting the autumn property tax starting today. The interim measures for the collection of this tax, after being passed by the Second All-Circles People's Representative Conference, have been submitted to the Central Ministry of Finance for approval and implementation. The Municipal Finance Bureau is actively mobilizing cadres to fill out and distribute tax payment notices for this purpose. After receiving the tax payment notice, each taxpayer must pay the tax at the designated payment location within five days; overdue payments will be penalized according to regulations. In order to simplify procedures and make it easier for citizens to understand the amount of tax they owe, the tax is calculated based on a fixed amount (a total of twenty grades). For example, for first-grade, first-class owner-occupied houses, the tax is nine *jin* of millet per room per quarter; for twentieth-grade, first-class owner-occupied houses, the tax is two and a half *jin* of millet per room per quarter. In addition to the regular tax, an additional 30% education and health fee is added. The price of millet for this tax calculation is uniformly set at 600 yuan per *jin*. From now on, the old house donation will be completely abolished.
