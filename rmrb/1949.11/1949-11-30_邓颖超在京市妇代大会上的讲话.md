　　Deng Yingchao's Speech at the Beijing Women's Congress

[Beijing News] Deng Yingchao's speech at the First Beijing Women's Congress is as follows:

　　(1) The women's work in Beijing in the nine months since the liberation of Beijing has been successful. The main manifestations are that the preparatory committee of the Beijing Women's Federation and the preparatory committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions have organized more than 80% of the 4,800 female workers in state-owned and private industries, handicrafts, and shop assistants in the city, raised their awareness and enthusiasm for production; on the other hand, a group of unorganized working women have been organized through various production forms and contents to develop production, and preliminary results have been achieved; in addition, specific work such as children's welfare work and organizing women to study has been carried out to serve the women's masses; unite various women's organizations and contact and promote women's work through various aspects. Problems have been discovered in the work, problems have been raised, and all problems have been solved, and some work experience has been gained. The achievement of these results is mainly due to the implementation of the resolution of the First National Women's Congress on the current tasks of the Chinese women's movement and the hard work of the preparatory committee of the Democratic Women's Federation and other women's organizations and female cadres in various aspects. However, we must not be complacent at all. Our work is not without shortcomings. In addition to agreeing with the part of Comrade Zhang Xiaomei's report on the future work policy; the leading body of the Women's Federation should be stronger and more humbly listen to opinions from all parties, develop step by step on the existing work foundation, and gradually expand the necessary and possible connections from all parties to expand the mass base. Use the greatest attention and effort to assist in solving difficulties such as funds and sales in organized production.

　　(2) Several issues concerning the Women's Representative Conference:

　　1. The Women's Representative Conference is a good organizational form, but it is not the only one. Diverse organizational forms are also needed, such as women's organizations in various industries such as culture, health, and production, and women's departments of various mass organizations.

　　2. The benefits of the Women's Representative Conference:

　　(1) It can more widely and democratically connect with the women's masses, including: organized and unorganized women's masses.

　　(2) Pool wisdom and benefit, promote democracy, and improve everyone's enthusiasm, so that things can be done well.

　　(3) Through representatives, the decisions of the meeting can be quickly implemented and conveyed to the masses to promote work, and at the same time, the opinions and requirements of the masses can be reflected to the top as quickly as possible through the representative meeting. This is also the task of the representatives.

　　(4) Through the exchange of experiences and mutual learning among the representatives at the meeting, a large number of activists can be educated and cultivated and promoted a step further.

　　3. The role of the Women's Representative Conference

　　Discuss the local women's work policy, tasks and important work, solve the urgent problems of the majority of the local masses, convey the policies and resolutions of the democratic government and higher-level governments, mobilize the broad masses of women to jointly implement them, and elect an executive committee through the representative conference to preside over the daily work. The Women's Representative Conference is also the best assistant to the People's Representative Conference and the People's Government.

　　4. How to hold the Women's Representative Conference well?

　　(1) Candidate selection: Ensure that representatives from all classes and aspects are included, and select people who are supported by the women's masses and can serve the women's masses as representatives, and avoid coercive orders and paternalistic methods.

　　(2) There should be sufficient preparation before the meeting, and the task of the meeting, the standard of representatives should be publicized through various forms, and the opinions of the masses should be collected to make a good preparation for the meeting.

　　(3) The meeting agenda should have a focus, not too much, and we should focus on solving one or two problems that are urgently needed by the broad masses. One meeting cannot solve all problems. Once a resolution is passed, it must be implemented. Do not pass resolutions that cannot be implemented or are unworkable rashly, and explain the reasons and reasons to the representatives and the masses by distinguishing between the importance, urgency, primary and secondary, and possibility or not. Whether the representative meeting can establish prestige, implement resolutions, and whether the resolutions can take effect is an important key.

　　(4) The meeting time should not be too long, and it should be based on the specific circumstances of the city and the countryside, and it should take into account that it does not hinder the production and business of the masses, and take into account the fatigue and emotions of the masses.

　　(5) Promote democracy, carry out criticism and self-criticism, so that various work can be supervised by the masses to improve work and overcome the bureaucratic style of cadres.

　　(3) Why do women's masses need a general, separate women's organization - a women's organization, a women's representative conference? Because:

　　(1) We must thoroughly overthrow imperialism and feudalism, eliminate the remnants of counter-revolutionaries, achieve a complete victory of the revolution throughout the country, and build a new democratic China. This is an arduous task. To build a new Beijing, our eyes must be on the broad masses of women in China, and the broad masses of women in China have not yet been organized, and we still need to carry out work. To organize them and the people of the whole country to unite together to complete the above tasks, the strength of organized women is indispensable, whether in thoroughly overthrowing the enemy or in building a new China.

　　(2) Judging from China's national conditions and the situation of women: China, not long ago, was still a colonial and semi-colonial country, and the elimination of feudalism still requires a long process. The Chinese women's masses have long been the most oppressed and bound in the feudal patriarchal society, and feel deeply painful, so they have special problems and special difficulties, so special work is needed among them. As long as women's problems exist, there is women's work. In order to facilitate solving problems for them and serving them, there needs to be a separate women's organization. But this does not mean that women's work can only be done separately by women's organizations, because where there are women's masses, there should be women's work. Therefore, although women's masses need a general and separate organization, women's work is the responsibility of all aspects and organizations.

　　(3) The task of women's organizations is not only to carry out women's work themselves, but also to actively and actively promote all organizations and aspects to carry out women's work, and all aspects, industries, and organizations should carry out work among their affiliated women's masses, which should become a part of their work. It should not and cannot be completely entrusted to the Women's Federation, or allowed to fall into a state of self-flow. Therefore, both parties must pay attention to mutual cooperation, and pay attention to good cooperation. We have already had a beginning and a preliminary transformation in this regard (Beijing is an example), but we do not have more achievements and experience. In order to do a good job in this regard, we must also overcome the difficulties existing in ideology, organization, and work. The main thing is to first open up our own thinking and overcome the ideology of excluding or highlighting women's work. This first requires overcoming the idea of underestimating women's work among female cadres, especially those who do women's work, regardless of doing women's work. Because the former is a non-holistic, non-comprehensive, but partial and one-sided view, and the latter is the essence of the feudal idea of valuing men over women. These ideas are divorced from reality, and will inevitably lead to being divorced from the masses, hindering the development of women's work, and also hindering the people's cause. But at the same time, it must be combined with organizational solutions and improvements in working methods.

　　(4) The difficulties of women's work and how to overcome them. Women's work is not without difficulties. It has difficulties from all aspects of society, family, itself, internal and external. It is a relatively arduous and complex work, but it must be done. Similarly, women's organizations also have such difficulties. Therefore, we must be brave to take responsibility and not retreat because of difficulties. We must first open up our own thinking, correctly recognize the importance of women's work, tirelessly do publicity and explanation work to others, bury ourselves in hard work, do not rush for success, and not be afraid of difficulties, setbacks, and frustrations, do not be discouraged, and do not be discouraged. We must unyieldingly serve the broad masses of women, especially the working women, and persevere. We must be a truly staunch fighter who wholeheartedly serves the people and women. Sisters! We have the strong Chinese Communist Party, the policy of equality between men and women formulated by the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and the various rights given to women. We have the leadership of the Central People's Government and the Beijing Municipal People's Government. These are all conditions that are extremely conducive to the development of the women's movement. As long as we add our firm confidence and tireless work, mobilize and organize the broad masses of women to work hard to realize the Common Program, women's work can be done well, and women throughout the country will surely be liberated!

### 邓颖超在京市妇代大会上的讲话

　　邓颖超在京市妇代大会上的讲话
    【北京讯】邓颖超在北京市第一次妇代大会上的讲话，文如下：
    （一）北京市解放以来九个月的妇女工作是有成绩的。主要的表现在北京市妇联筹委会和总工会筹委会一起把全市公私营产业、手工业、店员女工四千八百多人中的百分之八十以上的女工组织起来，提高了她们的觉悟和生产的积极性；另一方面，有重点的经过各种的生产形式和生产内容把一批无组织的劳动妇女组织起来，发展生产，得到了初步收获；此外并经过儿童福利工作、组织妇女学习等具体工作来为妇女群众服务；团结各妇女团体并连系和经过各方面去推动妇女工作。在工作中发现了问题，提出了问题，并解决了一切问题，取得了一些工作经验。这些成绩的获得，主要是由于执行了第一次全国妇女代表大会关于中国妇运当前任务的决议和民主妇联筹委会以及其他妇女团体和各方面的女干部努力工作的结果。但是，我们一点也不能自满，我们的工作不是没有缺点的。今后工作除同意张晓梅同志报告中今后工作方针的部分以外；妇联领导机构应更坚强，更谦虚倾听各方意见，在现有的工作基础上有步骤地去发展，逐渐的扩大必须的、可能的各方的连系，以扩大群众的基础。用最大的注意和努力协助解决组织生产中的资金和销路等困难。
    （二）关于妇女代表会议的几个问题：
    一、妇女代表会议是一个最好的组织形式，但不是唯一的，还需要多样的组织形式。如文化的，卫生的，生产的各业妇女的组织及各群众团体的妇女部门等。
    二、妇女代表会议的好处：
    （１）它能更广泛的、更民主的连系妇女群众，包括：有组织的和无组织的妇女群众。
    （２）集思广益，发扬民主，提高大家的积极性，能够把事情办好。
    （３）通过代表可以把会议的决定迅速的贯彻传达到群众中去推动工作，同时经过代表会又可以最快的把群众的意见与要求反映到上面来。这也就是代表的任务。
    （４）经过会议代表们交换经验，互相学习，可以大量的教育、培养积极分子并把她们提高一步。
    三、妇女代表会议的作用
    讨论当地妇女工作的方针、任务及重要工作，解决当地最大多数群众迫切的问题，传达民主政府及上级政府的政策和决议，发动广大妇女群众来共同执行，经过代表会议选出执行委员会，主持日常的工作。妇女代表会议它又是人民代表会议和人民政府的最好的助手。
    四、怎样把妇女代表会议开好？
    （１）代表人选：要保证包括各阶层、各方面的代表，要选出为妇女群众所拥护又能为妇女群众服务的人当代表，力避强迫命令和包办的方式。
    （２）会前要有充分的准备，经过各种形式，宣传会议的任务、代表的标准，搜集群众的意见，给会议做下很好的准备工作。
    （３）会议议程应有中心，不要太多，应抓紧解决为广大群众迫切需要解决的一两个问题。一次会议不可能解决一切问题。一经决议，一定要贯彻执行。凡不能执行或行不通的决议不要草率地通过，要分清轻重缓急，主次先后，可能与否向代表和群众解释，说明道理。代表会议能否建立威信，执行决议，决议能否发生效力是一重要关键。
    （４）会议时间不宜太长，要按照城、乡具体情况，要照顾到不妨碍群众的生产与业务，照顾到群众的疲劳和情绪。
    （５）发扬民主，展开批评与自我批评，使各种工作得到群众性的监督来改进工作，克服干部中的官僚主义的作风等。
    （三）妇女群众为什么需要一个一般的单独的妇女组织——妇女团体，妇女代表会议？因为：
    （１）我们要彻底打倒帝国主义，封建主义，肃清反革命残余，在全国范围，取得革命的全部胜利，建设起新民主主义的新中国，是一个艰巨的任务。要建设新北京，我们的眼光必须面向全中国广大妇女群众，而全中国广大的妇女群众还没有组织起来，还需要我们去进行工作。组织她们和全国人民团结一起完成上述任务，无论是在彻底的打倒敌人方面或是建设新中国的事业上，有组织的妇女的力量是不可缺少的。
    （２）根据中国的国情与妇女的处境来看：中国，不久以前还是一个殖民地、半殖民地的国家，肃清封建主义还需要长期的过程。中国妇女群众长期在封建宗法社会中最受压迫最受束缚，深感痛苦，因而有特殊的问题，特殊的困难，因此就需要特殊的在她们中间进行工作。只要存在着妇女问题就存在着妇女工作。为了便于为她们解决问题，为她们服务，就需要有单独的妇女组织。但这不等于妇女工作只有妇女的组织单独去做，因为在那里有妇女群众，那里就应该做妇女工作。所以，妇女群众虽然需要一个一般的单独的团体，但妇女工作却又是各方面，各团体应引以为己任的。
    （３）妇女团体的任务不仅自己去进行妇女工作，同时又要主动的，积极的去推动各团体各方面去进行妇女工作，而各方面、各行业、各团体在其所属的妇女群众中进行工作，应成为她工作的一部分。不应该也不能完全委之于妇联去做，或则任其陷于自流状态。所以双方必须注意相互配合，而且要注意配合得好，在这方面我们已经有了开端和初步的转变（北京市即其一例）但还没有更多的成绩与经验，为了把这方面的工作做好，我们还必须克服在思想上，组织上，工作上存在着的困难，主要的首先要在思想上要打通，克服对妇女工作除外或突出的思想，这首先要克服妇女干部中特别是做妇女工作的干部中卑视妇女工作不顾做妇女工作的思想。因为前者是非整体的，非全面的而是局部的片面的观点，后者则是重男轻女的封建思想的实质。这些思想是脱离实际的，必然会走到脱离群众，妨害了妇女工作的发展，也妨害了人民事业。但同时必须与组织上的解决，工作方法的改进结合起来。
    （４）妇女工作的困难和如何克服困难。妇女工作不是没有困难的，它有来自社会的、家庭的、本身的、内在和外在各方面的困难是一件比较艰苦，复杂但又必须做的工作。同样，妇女团体也具有这样一些困难。因此，我们就要勇于负责，不因难而退。必须首先打通我们自己的思想，正确认识妇女工作的重要不疲倦地向别人做宣传解释工作，埋头努力，不急于求功，不怕困难，碰钉子，受挫折，不泄气，不灰心，要不屈不挠的为广大妇女群众特别是为劳动妇女大众服务，坚持下去，我们要做一个真正全心全意为人民为妇女服务的坚强战士。姊妹们！我们有了坚强的中国共产党，有了人民政协共同纲领所制定的男女平等的政策，赋予妇女的各种权利。有了中央人民政府和北京市人民政府的领导。这些都是极有利于妇女运动发展的条件。只要加上我们坚定的信心，不疲倦的工作，把广大妇女群众发动和组织起来为实现共同纲领努力奋斗，妇女工作就能做好，全国妇女就一定能够得到解放！（附图片）
