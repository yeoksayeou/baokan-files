Indonesian Representative Mazjono Speaks at the Second Day of the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 19th: The following is the full text of the speech by Indonesian representative Mazjono at the second day of the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference:

　　Chairman, dear comrades:

　　Allow me, on behalf of the Indonesian workers and working masses united under the banner of the All-Indonesia Central Organization of Trade Unions, to extend my respects to the Executive Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions, to all the delegates of the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference, and especially to the Soviet Asian Republics and the representatives of China.

　　The Indonesian working class supports with great enthusiasm the decision of the World Federation of Trade Unions to convene the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference, and we are even more excited when we hear that this conference will be held in the capital of the new People's Republic of China.

　　Comrade Saillant, the General Secretary of the World Federation of Trade Unions, pointed out in his report the activities of the World Federation of Trade Unions in supporting the trade unions of our countries, and he widely elucidated the current international situation and the tasks of the working class. In addition to welcoming Comrade Saillant's report at this historic meeting, we would like to emphasize that this is the first time in the history of trade unions in Asia and Australia that trade union representatives from various countries in Asia and Australia have gathered together to freely discuss the development of their working-class movements. This working-class movement has grown and developed together with their national liberation struggles.

　　The connection between our common struggles and common circumstances will be greatly strengthened. At the same time, our trade union movement will be united and become a wing of the international trade union movement in the ranks of the World Federation of Trade Unions. Therefore, we especially welcome the establishment of the Liaison Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions for Asian and Australian countries.

　　American and British imperialism and their smaller partners, French and Dutch imperialism, often attempt to isolate our trade unions from our national liberation struggles, from the trade union movements of other countries, and from our great World Federation of Trade Unions. However, we workers in colonies and dependent countries know that without the international solidarity of the working class, our struggles cannot be victorious. This great conference will not only strengthen this international solidarity but will also prove that the workers of the whole world and the working class headed by the Soviet working class stand with us.

　　It is a very meaningful thing that there are also excellent representatives from imperialist Holland and France in our meeting place. I would like to ask these representatives to tell their comrades in their home countries that we are fighting against the same enemy—the reactionaries and imperialism.

　　There is no doubt that this conference will greatly strengthen the growing solidarity and close ties between the working people of Indonesia and the working people of Holland, and between the working people of Vietnam and the working people of France.

　　I am convinced that, despite the reactionary conspiracies carried out by Deakin and Carey, the working masses of Britain and the United States stand with us in our struggle, and stand with the World Federation of Trade Unions.

　　The fact that this conference is being held in victorious China demonstrates a great significance, because the victory of China is the victory of the vanguard of the people's revolution throughout Southeast Asia. The reason why we can convene this important conference should be attributed to the great People's Liberation Army and the great Chinese people under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong. This means that half of the world's population has been liberated from exploitation and capitalist rule. Our ability to gather here is not only the achievement and victory of our Chinese brothers but also the achievement of the international working class. This is a huge blow to imperialism, especially to the British and American imperialists who are trying to plunge the world into war.

　　Our conference will strengthen the forces of peace, and this conference unites the forces of peace in Asia and Australia. It will unite our forces fighting for freedom and democracy as firm as steel. We are fighting for freedom because we love peace. Comrade Saillant listed in his report many actions taken by the World Federation of Trade Unions to support the development of Indonesian trade unions and to support the All-Indonesia Central Organization of Trade Unions. The existence of the World Federation of Trade Unions has greatly strengthened our trade unions and the growth of our working-class movement. Our trade unions and working class are fighting to liberate our people.

　　What does this increase in solidarity mean to the Indonesian working masses? It means that despite the reactionary clique of Hatta and Sukarno who sold our freedom to Dutch and American imperialism, the Indonesian workers united in the All-Indonesia Central Organization of Trade Unions are encouraged and are rising up to continue their armed struggle against feudalism and imperialism.

　　Comrade Saillant pointed out that neither the Hatta government, the Dutch government, nor the United Nations responded to the letters written to them by the World Federation of Trade Unions.

　　Let me express here on behalf of the All-Indonesia Central Organization of Trade Unions that the working people of Indonesia, the workers of Holland, the working masses of the United States, and the workers of the whole world are responding to the call of our great World Federation of Trade Unions.

　　We are even more convinced that after this great conference, this international solidarity will definitely increase further.

　　Having attended the World Federation of Trade Unions Council in Prague in 1947, and today representing the All-Indonesia Central Organization of Trade Unions for the second time at this international conference, we would like to express our gratitude to the World Federation of Trade Unions for its recognition and continuous support of our struggle.

　　Let us congratulate the World Federation of Trade Unions for its activities in leading and supporting the struggles of workers all over the world. Long live the Asian and Australian Trade Union Conference!

　　亚澳工会会议第二日大会上
  　印尼代表玛佐诺讲话
    【新华社北京十九日电】印度尼西亚代表玛佐诺在亚澳工会会议第二日大会上的讲话，全文如下：
    主席，亲爱的同志们：
    让我代表团结在印尼总工会的旗帜之下的印尼工人和劳动群众，向世界工会联合会的执行局，向亚洲澳洲工会会议的全体代表们，特别是苏联的各个亚洲共和国以及中国的代表致敬。
    印尼工人阶级以莫大的热情支持世界工联关于召开亚澳工会会议的决定，当我们听到这个会议将在新中华人民共和国的首都举行时，我们更感兴奋。
    世界工联总书记赛扬同志在他的报告里指出了世界工联在支持我们这些国家的工会上所作的活动，他广泛地阐明了今天的国际形势和工人阶级的任务。除了欢迎赛扬同志在这个历史性会议上所作的报告之外，我们愿意强调指出，亚洲和澳洲各国的工会代表在一起集会，自由地讨论他们工人阶级运动的发展，这在亚洲与澳洲的工会历史上还是第一次。这个工人阶级运动已经和他们的民族解放斗争一道成长和发展了。
    我们的共同斗争与共同情况的联系将大为加强。同时我们的工会运动将团结一致，成为世界工联队伍中的国际工会运动的一翼。因此，我们特别着重地欢迎世界工联亚洲与澳洲各国联络局的建立。
    美英帝国主义及其较小的伙伴法国与荷兰帝国主义经常企图使我们的工会从我们的民族解放斗争、从其他各国的工会运动以及从我们伟大的世界工联中孤立开来。但是，我们殖民地和附属国的工人知道没有工人阶级的国际团结，我们的斗争就不能取得胜利。我们这个伟大的会议将不仅加强这种国际团结，而且将证实全世界的工人和以苏联工人阶级为首的工人阶级是和我们站在一起的。
    在我们的会场里也有着从帝国主义的荷兰和法国来的优秀的代表们，这是一件非常有意义的事情。我愿意要求这些代表转告他们本国的同志们：我们是在对同一个敌人——反动派和帝国主义——作斗争。
    毫无疑问，这次会议一定会大大地加强印尼劳动人民和荷兰劳动人民之间和越南劳动人民和法国劳动人民之间的正在增长着的团结和休戚相关。
    我确信，尽管狄金和加莱所进行的反动图谋，在我们的斗争中，英国和美国的劳动群众是和我们站在一起的，是和世界工联站在一起的。
    这个会议是在胜利的中国举行的，这件事实表现了一个伟大的意义，因为中国的胜利是整个东南亚人民革命的先锋队的胜利，我们这个重要会议之所以能够召开，应当感谢伟大的人民解放军和毛泽东同志领导下的伟大的中国人民，这意味着全世界人口的一半已经从被剥削、从资本主义统治之下解放出来了。我们能够在这里聚会一堂不仅是我们的中国弟兄们的成就和胜利，而且也是国际工人阶级的成就。这对帝国主义，特别是对企图把世界投入战争中的英美帝国主义者，是一个巨大的打击。
    我们这次会议将加强和平的力量，这次会议团结着亚洲和澳洲的和平力量。它将使我们争取自由与民主的力量团结得象钢铁一样。我们正在为自由而斗争，因为我们爱好和平。赛扬同志在他的报告中列举了许多世界工联为支持印尼工会的发展，为支持印尼总工会而采取的行动。世界工联的存在大大地加强了我们工会，和我们工人阶级运动的生长。我们的工会和工人阶级正在为解放我们的人民而斗争。
    这种团结的增加对于印尼工人群众意味着什么呢？这意味着尽管有那个把我们的自由出卖给了荷兰和美帝国主义的哈达和苏加诺的反动集团，团结在印尼总工会中的印尼工人，是被鼓舞起来了，并且正在起来对封建主义和帝国主义继续进行武装斗争。
    赛扬同志指出：不论是哈达政府，荷兰政府，或者联合国都没有答复世界工联写给它们的信。
    让我代表印尼总工会在这里表示：印尼的劳动人民，荷兰的工人，美国的劳动群众，全世界的工人都在响应我们伟大世界工联的号召。
    我们更加深信：在这次伟大的会议之后，这种国际团结定将进一步增加。
    在出席一九四七年布拉格世界工联理事会之后，今天第二次代表印尼总工会出席这次国际会议，我们愿意对世界工联对我们斗争的承认和不断的支持表示感激。
    让我们祝贺世界工联为领导和支持全世界工人的斗争而作的活动。亚洲和澳洲各国工会会议万岁！
