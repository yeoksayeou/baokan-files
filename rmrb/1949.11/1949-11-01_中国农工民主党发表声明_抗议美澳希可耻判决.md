The China National Revolutionary Committee Issues Statement
	Protesting Shameful Verdicts by the US, Australia and Greece
	[This newspaper report] The China National Revolutionary Committee has issued a statement firmly protesting the shameful verdicts of the reactionary governments of the United States, Australia, and Greece in persecuting people's leaders. The full text of the statement is as follows:
	Because American Communist Party leaders Dennis and ten others loyally safeguard the interests of the American people, loyally safeguard world peace, and firmly stand on the side of democracy and progress, opposing the reactionary government's deprivation of people's freedom and exposing the various conspiracies of American imperialism, they were sentenced to imprisonment and fines by the reactionary government on the grounds of so-called "incitement to subvert the American government by violence." Even the six lawyers who defended the American Communist Party leaders were sentenced to several months in prison. Similarly, under the instigation of the reactionary American government, the Melbourne Supreme Court sentenced Australian Communist Party leader Sharkey to imprisonment for "publishing treasonous remarks." At the same time, the reactionary Athens Military Court, needless to say, acted in accordance with the will of American imperialism and sentenced Greek revolutionary woman leader Katelina to death. We firmly oppose such inhumane and criminal verdicts, and we warn the reactionary governments of the United States, Australia, and Greece to immediately revoke these verdicts and restore the freedom of the revolutionary leaders. Such verdicts are a shameful crime that will arouse the public outrage of the people of the world and lead to serious consequences.
	The despicable crimes of the reactionary governments of the United States, Australia, and Greece demonstrate the extent to which decadent capitalism has decayed, and demonstrate that the so-called "democracy" and "freedom" of American imperialism are nothing but a trick. In essence, it is outright fascism. The Chinese people have experienced the "democracy" and "freedom" of the United States, and its various conspiracies to enslave China have also been shattered by the Chinese people. In this shameful verdict, the people of the world have further recognized the hideous face of American imperialism, and recognized how despicable and cowardly the reactionaries are in the face of the power of the people, and how they have exhausted their tricks. The international reactionary forces headed by American imperialism are facing the eve of total collapse. Let the democratic and progressive forces of the world, the peace-loving people of the world, unite to bring about this day sooner.

　　中国农工民主党发表声明
  　抗议美澳希可耻判决
    【本报讯】中国农工民主党发表声明，坚决抗议美、澳、希反动政府迫害人民领袖的可耻的判决，声明全文如下：
    由于美国共产党领袖但尼斯等十一位忠诚的维护美国人民利益，忠诚的维护世界和平，坚决的站在民主进步方面，反对反动政府剥夺人民自由，揭露美帝种种阴谋诡计，就被反动政府以所谓“教唆以暴力颠覆美国政府”的罪名，判处了徒刑、罚金，甚至连替美国共产党领袖辩护的六位律师，也处以几个月的徒刑；同样在美国反动政府怂恿下，墨尔钵最高法院以“发表叛国言论罪”判处了澳大利共产党领袖夏基的徒刑；同时反动的雅典军事法庭不待说，是秉承了美帝的意志，竟判决了希腊革命妇女领袖卡特林的死刑。我们坚决反对这种无人性的罪恶的判决，我们警告美、澳、希反动政府即刻取消这判决，恢复革命领袖们的自由。这种判决，是一种可耻的罪行，必将引起全世界人民的公愤，引起严重的后果。
    美、澳、希反动政府，这种卑鄙的罪行，说明了腐朽的资本主义腐朽到了什么程度，说明了美帝国主义的所谓“民主”“自由”不过是一个骗局，实质上则是不折不扣的法西斯，美帝的“民主”“自由”中国人民是领教过了，它奴役中国的种种阴谋，也都被中国人民所粉碎了，全世界人民在这次可耻的判决中，更进一步认识了美帝的狰狞面目，认识了反动派在人民威力之前，是何等的卑鄙懦怯，是怎样的黔驴技穷。以美帝为首的国际反动势力，已面临总崩溃的前夕，全世界民主进步力量，全世界爱好和平人民，一致联合起来，促成这个日子早日到来。
