　　China Democratic Progressive Association Issues Statement
　　Condemning Barbaric Trials by American, Australian, and Greek Reactionaries

　　[Reported by this newspaper] The China Democratic Progressive Association issued a statement protesting the barbaric trials of revolutionary leaders by the reactionary factions of the United States, Australia, and Greece. The text is as follows:

　　On October 21st, Judge Medina of the U.S. Federal Court in New York sentenced Eugene Dennis, General Secretary of the National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States, and ten others to five or three years imprisonment and a fine of ten thousand dollars each, on the so-called charge of "inciting the violent overthrow of the U.S. government." Medina also sentenced six lawyers who defended the CPUSA leaders to imprisonment. On October 17th, the Melbourne Supreme Court sentenced Sharkey, General Secretary of the Australian Communist Party, to three years imprisonment for the so-called "crime of making treasonous remarks." On October 13th, the Athens Military Court sentenced revolutionary women leaders Katrin Taragani and five others to death.

　　This series of anti-communist, anti-Soviet, and counter-revolutionary criminal activities are, in reality, directly or indirectly orchestrated by the Wall Street monopoly capitalists. The China Democratic Progressive Association strongly protests these unreasonable and shameful criminal measures taken by the reactionary governments of the United States, Australia, and Greece to destroy peace and democracy!

　　The revolutionary leaders of the United States, Australia, and Greece are loyally serving the working people and are respected and supported by them. Because they uphold truth, oppose regression, support peace, and oppose war, and represent the interests of the working people, they are feared by the fascist rulers, leading to their imprisonment or execution. The fascist rulers, led by U.S. imperialism, attempt to launch new wars to save themselves from their impending doom. However, human history will never follow their sinister plans. It will inevitably advance along the path of people's liberation, and the fascist rulers will surely perish. We firmly believe that the people of the world will fully support the solemn work of the revolutionary leaders of the United States, Australia, and Greece in defending democracy and peace. The heroic revolutionary leaders, who have contributed their freedom and lives to defend democracy and peace, will inspire millions of people to fight against imperialism.

　　中国民主促进会发表声明
  　斥美澳希反动派野蛮审判
    【本报讯】中国民主促进会为抗议美澳希三国反动派对革命领袖的野蛮审判发表声明，文如下：
    十月二十一日美国纽约联邦法院法官麦迪纳以所谓“教唆以暴力颠覆美国政府”的罪名，判处美国共产党全国委员会总书记但尼斯等十一人各以五年或三年徒刑和一万美元，麦迪纳并对为美共领袖辩护的六位律师也判处徒刑。十月十七日墨尔本最高法院以所谓“发表叛国言论罪”判处澳大利亚共产党总书记夏基以徒刑三年。十月十三日雅典军事法庭对革命妇女领袖卡特林·塔拉甘尼等六人判处死刑。
    这一连串反共反苏反革命的罪恶活动，实际上都是在华尔街独占资本家直接或间接导演之下，而产生出来的。中国民主促进会严重抗议美、澳、希三国反动政府这样无理而可耻的摧残和平民主的罪恶措施！
    美、澳、希的革命领袖们，是忠诚地为劳动人民服务，而为劳动人民所敬爱和拥护的。由于他们坚持真理，反对倒退，拥护和平，反对战争，代表了劳动人民的利益，为法西斯统治者所忌，以致被判徒刑或死刑。以美帝国主义为首的各国法西斯统治者们，企图以发动新的战争，来挽救他们面临的死亡，但是人类的历史决不会按照他们的阴谋计划进行，一定要沿着人民解放的道路前进，而法西斯统治者必将走向灭亡。我们深深相信：全世界人民将会以全力支持美、澳、希革命领袖们保卫民主和平的庄严工作。英勇的革命领袖们，为了保卫民主和平而贡献了他们的自由和生命，将会感召千百万人民为反对帝国主义而斗争。
