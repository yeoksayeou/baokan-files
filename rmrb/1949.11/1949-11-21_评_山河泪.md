　　Review of "Mountain and River Tears"
　　Tang Ding
　　In Beijing, "Mountain and River Tears" is still in its initial run. Its content, as advertised, depicts "national hatred and family feuds, tears spilled across mountains and rivers."
　　A year ago in Hong Kong, under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, there were many restrictions in all aspects. To film a picture with the northern way of life as its background and northern peasants as its main characters was indeed fraught with difficulties. We can understand the efforts of the director and actors, and their infinite nostalgia for the north and the suffering countryside. We also feel that they are worthy of respect.
　　The concentrated tragic story, the tense scenes, once stirred the hearts of the petty-bourgeoisie audience, and also had a strong educational significance in terms of hatred for landlords, bullies, and traitors.
　　Among the films released in the past one or two years, besides "Lights of Ten Thousand Homes," "The Story of Ah Q," etc., "Mountain and River Tears" can be considered one of the films with a certain weight.
　　But we cannot be satisfied with this. We feel that there are still some issues worth discussing in "Mountain and River Tears." Even if it was filmed under those circumstances, these should still be considered on some important key points.
　　The first question that comes to our minds is: What kind of army did the main character, Cheng Qinggen, join? Was it the Eighth Route Army guerrilla force? Or the Kuomintang army?
　　If he joined the Eighth Route Army guerrilla force, then after more than four years of service, he should have had considerable political awareness and class consciousness. He would not be so homesick as to desert. After returning home, when so many incidents happened to him, he would not merely be an individual resisting. He would definitely persuade and educate his parents, wife, and sister; he would definitely publicize and organize his villagers to conduct various legal or illegal struggles against the enemy, traitors, and landlords. This is the typical Eighth Route Army guerrilla fighter. But Cheng Qinggen is not like that.
　　Then is it the Kuomintang army? Cheng Qinggen was drafted into the army by the village head. Then it should be the Kuomintang army. However, the essence of the Kuomintang army is not expressed, which often makes the audience very vague, because the life of that unit is guerrilla-style, and they are so close to the enemy. After more than four years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, that is to say, after they had already turned from passively resisting Japan to openly and actively opposing communism and the people, and after major incidents like the Southern Anhui Incident had occurred, did they really still insist on staying in the north? Did they really dare to operate on the edge of the occupied areas? Is this true? The fact is: the Kuomintang army had already fled as early as when the Japanese imperialists had just invaded North China. Those who did not flee either passively resisted Japan, colluded with the Japanese, or completely surrendered to the enemy and became puppet troops, turning their guns around to actively oppose communism. What kind of army is the "anti-Japanese army" that the traitorous village head keeps calling Cheng Qinggen after he returns home!
　　The second question that comes to our minds is: What is Cheng Qinggen's family's class background? Is it middle peasant? Or poor peasant?
　　If they are said to be middle peasants, they seem to be making a living by renting Mr. Bai's land and being exploited. The second daughter is also herding sheep for Mr. Bai. Moreover, they can't eat white flour a few times a year. When Cheng Qinggen's father is sick, other than using his daughter-in-law's body to exchange for some of Mr. Bai's false assistance, there seems to be no other way. Based on these circumstances, it does not seem like a middle peasant family.
　　Are they poor peasants? The daughters and daughters-in-law are dressed so beautifully, and there is a large stone mill in front of the cave dwelling. When the daughter gets married, those who come to help are not poor peasant women either. And the entire film focuses more on the children's sentiments than on the portrayal of labor. From the landlord's perspective, when he wants to plot to deceive the poor peasant's daughter, he will not simply rely on power and political status, but more often rely on the weapon of economic exploitation to threaten and lure, so that the poor peasant has to fall into his trap. Although the movie also has this intention, it is not obvious, not prominent, not strong, and cannot play a role in exposing and educating the audience.
　　The so-called "national hatred and family feuds" is actually a superficial description of national hatred, completely lacking in strength. The family feuds? It only focuses on the tragic stories of two young women being seized and occupied.
　　The portrayal of the peasants' lives and feelings has a considerable distance from reality. It is coated with the tastes of intellectuals and many imagined elements. For example, the scene of Qinggen returning home. When he meets his sister, mother, and wife, they all hug tightly. In China, in the northern countryside, we don't seem to have seen or heard of peasants using such methods to express their feelings. The joy of the Qinggen couple meeting is by no means fully expressed by a vulgar piece of clothing, a mirror, or lingering in bed.
　　Peasants love their relatives, and they also love their land and livestock. The movie writes that Qinggen's father and wife, hearing that Qinggen is coming back, leave the livestock that is plowing the field and leave it unattended. The fanatical intellectuals may be like this, but the industrious peasants who rely on the land and livestock to make a living may not be so.
　　And what makes us most uneasy is the characterization of Qinggen's mother and wife's qualities in the movie. It is true that they are oppressed and trampled on, but they are upright peasants. In the matter of Mr. Bai insulting them, they rarely show their contradictions and resistance. The wife allows the incident to tolerate until Qinggen returns home and cannot but be resolved before considering it, and the only way to resolve it is suicide. When the audience sees this, they will naturally ask such questions, right? If Qinggen does not come back, will this situation continue indefinitely? What about the mother's attitude? Her sympathy and understanding of her daughter-in-law is correct, but at the beginning, she almost has a tacit understanding and instigation, which is worthy of consideration.
　　We cannot say that there are no such situations, but this should only be meaningful in occasions where peasants are criticizing and self-criticizing. In a story like "Mountain and River Tears," in the characters that the audience places all their sympathy on, not meticulously expressing their inner contradictions, not perfectly expressing their class qualities, we cannot help but feel regret, and cannot but weaken the characters' appeal to the audience.
　　These are the opinions on "Mountain and River Tears." Perhaps this requirement is a bit high and harsh for a film shot under those circumstances. But for the people's film artists who continue to strive to express the new society, the new characters, and the new events, we place our ardent hope, "to love deeply is to demand strictly," perhaps this is not too much!

### 评“山河泪”

　　评“山河泪”
　　唐丁
    在北京，“山河泪”还是初度上演，它的内容，正如广告所揭载的，描写的是“国恨家仇，泪洒山河”。
    在一年前的香港，在国民党反动派的统治之下，各方面受到很多限制，而要拍摄这样一张以北方生活为背景，以北方农民为主要人物的片子，的确是有不少困难的。导演和演员们的努力，他们对于北方、对于苦难的农村寄以无穷怀念的心情，我们是可以了解到，也觉得是值得尊敬的。
    那集中的悲剧的故事，那紧张的场面，曾使小市民观众心弦激动，在对地主、恶霸、汉奸的仇恨上，也有着较强烈的教育意义。
    在最近一二年出的电影片子里，除了“万家灯火”、“祥林嫂”等等，“山河泪”也可以算是有着一定分量的片子之一。
    但我们并不能就此满足，我们觉得，在“山河泪”里，还存在着一些值得商榷的问题，即使是在那样的境况之下拍摄的吧，在某些重要的关键上，还是应该考虑到的。
    首先使我们想到的问题是：主要人物成庆根，他参加的军队究竟是什么军队？是八路军游击队吗？还是国民党军队？
    如果说他参加的是八路军游击队，那末他参军四年多，应该有了相当的政治认识，阶级觉悟，他不会那么想家，以至开小差。到家以后，那么许多事变集中到头上时，他也不会仅仅是个人的反抗，他一定会说服、教育他的父母、妻子、妹妹；他一定会宣传，组织他的村人，对敌人、汉奸、地主进行各种合法的或不合法的斗争。这才是典型的八路军游击队。但成庆根并不是这样。
    那末是国民党军队吗？成庆根是被乡长派丁派到队伍上去的，那末应该是国民党的军队了。但是，却没有把国民党军队的本质表现出来，常常使观众很模糊，因为那部队的生活是游击队式的，他们离敌人又那么近。国民党的军队，在抗战已经四年多的时候，即是说，他们已经由消极抗战而变为露骨的积极反共、反人民，发生了象皖南事变那样重大的事件之后，他们真还有坚持在北方的吗？真还有敢于活动在沦陷区边缘的吗？这是真实的吗？事实是：国民党军队就在日本帝国主义者刚刚侵入华北的当时，早已逃之夭夭了。不逃的也有，不是消极抗战，就是与日冠勾结，或是完全投敌成了伪军，掉转枪头，来积极反共了。那成庆根回家后，汉奸乡长口口声声称他是“抗日军队”的军队，到底是什么军队呢！
    其次使我们想到的问题是：成庆根的家庭，究竟是什么成份？是中农吗？还是贫农？
    说是中农吧，他们好象又靠着租种白老爷的地过活，受着剥削的，二丫头也在给白老爷揽着羊。而且他们一年吃不上几回白面，成庆根的父亲病了，除了以媳妇的肉体去换得一点白少爷的虚假的接济外，又象别无办法了。根据这些情形，似乎不能算是一个中农的家庭。
    是贫农吗？女儿、媳妇又打扮得那样漂亮，窑洞门前还有着一盘大石碾，女儿出嫁时，来帮忙的也都不是贫农妇女。而整个片子，儿女的情趣胜过于对劳动的刻划。从地主方面看来他要谋骗贫农的女儿时，不会单纯的用权势，用政治的地位，更多的时候是靠经济剥削的武器，来威胁，来诱致，使贫农不得不上他的圈套。虽然电影里也有这企图，但不明显、不突出、不强烈、不能对观众起揭发与教育的作用。
    而所谓“国恨家仇”，实际上国恨是轻描淡写，完全没有力量的。家仇呢？也只集中在两个年青女人的被霸占的悲剧故事上。
    对于农民的生活、感情的刻划，和现实有着不小的距离，它是蒙上了知识分子的趣味和不少想象的成份的。比如庆根回家的场面，他和他妹妹、母亲、妻子相见时，都是紧紧的拥抱。在中国，在北方农村里，我们好象还不曾见过和听过农民用这样的方法来表示他们的感情的。庆根夫妇见面的欢快，也决不是庸俗的一件衣料，一面镜子，或炕头上的缠绵所能充分表现的。
    农民爱他们的亲属，也爱他们的土地、牲畜。电影里写成庆根父亲和妻子，听说庆根归来，把正在耕地的牲口抛下不顾就走了。狂热的知识分子也许是这样，在勤劳的靠土地、牲畜生活的农民则未必如此。
    而最使我们不能释然于怀的，是电影里对庆根的母亲和妻子品质的刻划。不错，她们是被压迫，被蹂躏的，但她们是正直的农民。在对白少爷侮辱她们这问题上，很少看见她们的矛盾和反抗。妻子是让事件容忍到庆根回家后不能不解决时才考虑到的，而解决的唯一的路是自寻短见。观众看到这里，就会很自然的提出这样的问题来的吧？如果庆根不回来的话，难道就一直让这情况延续下去吗？母亲的态度呢？她对媳妇同情、谅解是对的，但开始时几乎有点默契与怂恿的样子，是可以考虑的。
    我们不能说没有如上的情形，但这只应在对农民作批评与自我批评的场合才有意义，在“山河泪”这样的故事里，在观众寄予全部同情的人物身上，不细致地表现她们内心的矛盾，不完善地表现她们阶级的品质，就不能不使我们觉得遗憾，也不能不减弱人物对观众的感染力。
    对于“山河泪”的意见，就讲出这些。也许对于在那样的境况之下拍摄的片子，这要求是较高较苛了些。但对于今后继续努力来表现新的社会，新的人物，新的事件的人民电影艺术工作者，寄予我们热切的希望，“爱之也深，求之也苛”，大概这不算过份吧！
