    US, Britain Undermine UN Dignity
    UN General Assembly Political Committee Actually Discusses the Kuomintang Imposter Representative's Slanderous Statement Against the Soviet Union
    Representatives of the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, etc., Refuse to Participate
    Will Not Be Bound by Any Decisions Passed on This Issue
    Unanimously Support the Solemn Declaration of the Central People's Government of China
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 28th] TASS, New York, 26th: The Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly began discussing the Kuomintang's slanderous accusations against the Soviet Union on the 25th. This accusation was proposed by the representatives of the Kuomintang group and actively supported by the US and British delegations to be included in the agenda of this session of the General Assembly, with the aim of using this deceptive trick to carry out a new slander campaign against the Soviet Union and to cover up the real reasons for the collapse of the Kuomintang group in China.
    After the chairman announced the opening of the meeting, Vyshinsky, the head of the Soviet delegation, spoke in turn and made the following statement: At the end of September this year, based on the proposal of the Kuomintang representative Jiang Tingfu, the "Threats to the Political Independence and Territorial Integrity of China, and Threats to Peace in the Far East" was included in the agenda, insisting that this threat was caused by the Soviet Union's violation of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of August 14, 1945, and its violation of the United Nations Charter.
    The Soviet delegation pointed out the slanderous and provocative nature of this motion during the discussion of this issue by the General Committee, and later at the plenary meeting of the General Assembly, because there was no question of any threat to the political independence and territorial integrity of China, and to peace in the Far East, nor was there any question of the Soviet Union violating the United Nations Charter. The Soviet delegation pointed out at that time that the sole purpose of raising this issue was to reduce public attention to the developing historical events in China. This historical event occurred because the Chinese people had won a great victory in a long and arduous struggle against domestic reactionaries and the oppression of foreign imperialism.
    The Soviet delegation has notified the United Nations that the Soviet delegation supports the statement made to the President of the General Assembly by Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, which refuses to recognize the legitimacy of the delegation led by Jiang Tingfu and sent to this session of the General Assembly by the so-called "Chinese Kuomintang Government," and refuses to recognize the right of this delegation to represent China and to speak on behalf of the Chinese people at the United Nations General Assembly.
    The Soviet delegation supports this statement of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China. The Soviet delegation believes that the Chinese delegation here now is not qualified because it does not represent the Chinese people. The Soviet delegation declares that it is completely incorrect to review the Kuomintang's slanderous accusations submitted by the former Chinese Kuomintang government in the United Nations. The Kuomintang government has no right to make any demands representing Chinese interests. Considering this issue under these circumstances, giving some importance to the statement of the imposter representative of this so-called "government" is incompatible with the dignity of the United Nations. Because the rights of this so-called "government," if not counting that small and insignificant piece of Chinese territory, can no longer reach China, and even this small piece of territory, liberated from Chiang Kai-shek's oppression, is just around the corner.

　　Kuomintang's Slanderous Condemnation of the Soviet Union Tries to Cover Up the Real Reasons for Failure
    The Soviet delegation pointed out its complete bankruptcy in discussing the issue of including the Kuomintang's deceptive trick on the agenda regarding the Kuomintang's slanderous accusations of so-called violations of the 1945 Sino-Soviet Treaty or the United Nations Charter, which cannot withstand any criticism. This Kuomintang's slanderous condemnation is a political deception trick that has been forced in, in order to cover up the true reasons for the bankruptcy and failure of the Kuomintang group of Chinese militarists, and to try to delay the inevitable demise of their rule in China. Everyone knows that the submission of this slanderous condemnation to the United Nations for review is supported by certain delegations headed by the US and British delegations. This is naturally another new blow to the prestige and dignity of the United Nations.
    In view of the above circumstances, the Soviet delegation announces that it will not participate in the discussion of the issues raised by the Kuomintang delegation. The Chinese people have now deprived this delegation of any rights. The Soviet delegation will not recognize any decisions passed at the request of the Kuomintang group.
    Manuilsky, head of the Ukrainian Republic delegation, spoke next. He said: In view of the statement of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China on depriving the Kuomintang delegation of the right to represent China in the United Nations and its agencies, the Ukrainian Republic delegation will not participate in the Political Committee's discussion of the Kuomintang delegation's slanderous condemnation. The Ukrainian Republic delegation believes that it is not bound by any decisions passed by the Political Committee regarding this slanderous condemnation of the so-called delegation that has lost the trust of the people.
    Kiselyov, head of the Belarusian Republic delegation, pointed out: The Belarusian Republic delegation has stated at the plenary meeting of the General Assembly on the 22nd that it does not recognize the Kuomintang government delegation, because this delegation no longer represents China and has no right to speak on behalf of the Chinese people. Kiselyov said: The Belarusian Republic delegation will only recognize the representatives of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, which is the only government representing all the people of the People's Republic of China. Therefore, the Belarusian Republic delegation will not participate in the discussion of the Kuomintang's slanderous condemnation of the great Soviet Union, and will not recognize the decisions of the Political Committee and the plenary meeting of the General Assembly on this issue.
    Polish representative Wierblowski said that the representatives of the so-called Kuomintang government have no right to speak on behalf of the Chinese people. Everyone knows that in its statement of November 15, 1949, the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China has deprived the Kuomintang representatives of the right to represent the Chinese people. The issues on the agenda now are malicious slanders by people who have no right to sit in the United Nations. The Polish delegation does not participate in the discussion of this item on the agenda and does not consider itself bound by the decisions passed by the Political Committee on this issue.
    Czechoslovak delegation leader Clementis spoke briefly in turn, saying that the telegram from the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China has deprived the Kuomintang representatives of the right to represent the Chinese people in the United Nations.
    The representative of the Kuomintang group, Jiang Tingfu, with the support of Canadian Foreign Minister Pearson, delivered a speech full of malicious slanderous attacks on the Soviet Union. Because Jiang Tingfu could not produce actual evidence to support his slanderous remarks, he attempted to attack the Soviet Union with various fabricated false testimonies and with slanderous anti-Soviet news and unfounded rumors from American newspapers.
    The discussion of the Kuomintang's slanderous condemnation will continue at the next meeting of the Political Committee on November 28.

### 苏波捷等国代表拒绝参加

　　美英破坏联合国尊严
    联大政委会竟讨论国民党冒牌代表对苏诽谤性声明
    苏波捷等国代表拒绝参加
  　将不受对此问题通过决定的任何约束
    一致支持我国中央人民政府庄严声明
    【新华社北京二十八日电】塔斯社纽约二十六日讯：联合国大会政治委员会于二十五日开始讨论国民党对于苏联的诽谤性的控诉。这一控诉是国民党集团的代表所提出，并得到美英代表团的积极支持而列入本届大会的议程中的，其目的则在意图利用这个欺骗勾当来对苏联进行新的诽谤运动，并借以掩盖国民党集团在中国崩溃的真正原因。
    在主席宣布开会以后，苏联代表团团长维辛斯基依次发言，发表声明如下：今年九月底，根据国民党代表蒋廷黻的建议，将“对中国的政治独立和领土完整的威胁，及对远东和平的威胁问题”列入了议程，硬说这种威胁是苏联破坏一九四五年八月十四日的苏中条约与违背联合国宪章所造成的。
    苏联代表团曾经在综合委员会讨论这个问题的期间，后来又在大会全体会议上，指出这个议案的诽谤和挑拨性质，因为根本谈不上苏联对于中国的政治独立和领土完整，以及对于远东的和平有任何的威胁，同时，也谈不上苏联对联合国宪章有所违犯。苏联代表团那时候就曾经指出：提出这个问题的唯一目的，是减少公众对于中国正在发展着的历史事变的注意。这个历史事变是由于中国人民在反对国内反动派和外国帝国主义的压迫的长期与艰苦的斗争中获得了伟大胜利而发生的。
    苏联代表团已经通知联合国，苏联代表团支持由中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部部长周恩来致大会主席的声明，该声明拒绝承认由蒋廷黻率领及由所谓“中国国民政府”派到本届大会的代表团的合法地位，拒绝承认这个代表团代表中国及代表中国人民在联合国大会上发言的权利。
    苏联代表团支持中华人民共和国中央人民政府的这个声明。苏联代表团认为现在此间的中国代表团没有资格，因为它并不代表中国人民。苏联代表团声明，在联合国中审查由前中国国民党政府所提出的国民党的诽谤性的控诉，是完全不正确的，国民党政府已毫无权利提出代表中国利益的任何要求。在这种情形之下来考虑这个问题，给予这个所谓“政府”的冒牌代表的声明以某种重视，是与联合国的尊严不相容的。因为这个所谓“政府”的权利，如果不把那一小块微不足道的中国领土计算在内的话，已不复能达到中国，就是这一小块领土，从蒋介石的压迫下解放出来，也已计日可待了。
　　国民党对苏诽谤性谴责　企图掩盖失败真正原因
    苏联代表团对于国民党的诽谤性的控诉，在讨论将国民党这个欺骗勾当列入议程的问题时，就已指出了它的完全破产。国民党分子对于所谓违背一九四五年苏中条约或联合国宪章的控诉，是经不住任何批评的。这种国民党的诽谤性的谴责是硬被拉进来的政治欺骗勾当，借以掩盖中国黩武主义者的国民党集团的破产和失败的真正原因，企图延缓他们在中国之统治的不可避免的灭亡。大家都知道把这个诽谤性的谴责提交联合国加以审查，是受到以美国和英国代表团为首的某些代表团的支持的。这自然又是对于联合国的威信和尊严的一个新打击。
    鉴于以上的情况，苏联代表团宣布：它将不参加对于国民党代表团所提出的问题的讨论。中国人民现在业已剥夺了这个代表团的任何权利。苏联代表团并将不承认依照国民党集团的要求而通过的任何决定。
    乌克兰共和国代表团团长曼努意斯基继起发言。他说：鉴于中华人民共和国中央人民政府关于剥夺国民党代表团在联合国及其机构中代表中国的权力的声明，乌克兰共和国代表团不参加政治委员会关于国民党代表团的诽谤性谴责的讨论，乌克兰共和国代表团认为它对政治委员会所通过的关于这个已经失去人民信任的所谓代表团的诽谤性谴责的决定，不受任何约束。
    白俄罗斯共和国代表团团长基塞列夫指出：白俄罗斯共和国代表团已经在二十二日联大的全体会议上声明，它不承认国民党政府代表团，因为这个代表团已不代表中国，而且已没有权利代表中国人民说话。基塞列夫说：白俄罗斯共和国代表团将来只承认中华人民共和国中央人民政府的代表，这个政府是代表中华人民共和国全体人民的唯一的政府。因此，白俄罗斯共和国代表团将不参加国民党对伟大苏联的诽谤性谴责的讨论，并且，不承认政治委员会以及联大全体会议对于这个问题的决定。
    波兰代表维尔布洛夫斯基说，所谓国民党政府的代表，无权代表中国人民发言。大家知道，中华人民共和国中央人民政府在一九四九年十一月十五日的声明中，已剥夺了国民党代表代表中国人民的权利。现在议程上的问题乃是一些没有权利坐在联合国里的人的恶意诽谤。波兰代表团不参加议程上这个项目的讨论，并不认为它本身受政治委员会在这个问题上所通过的决定的约束。
    捷克斯洛代克代表团团长克利门蒂斯依次作简短发言，他说：中华人民共和国中央人民政府的来电，已剥夺了国民党代表在联合国中代表中国人民的权利。
    国民党集团的代表蒋廷黻在加拿大外长皮尔逊支持下，发表了对苏联充满恶意诽谤的攻击的演说。蒋延黻由于拿不出实际证据来支持他的诽谤性谰言，就企图用凭空捏造的各种伪证和用美国报纸上的诽谤性的反苏消息和无稽谣言，来攻击苏联。
    国民党诽谤性谴责的讨论，将于十一月二十八日政治委员会的下次会议上继续进行。
