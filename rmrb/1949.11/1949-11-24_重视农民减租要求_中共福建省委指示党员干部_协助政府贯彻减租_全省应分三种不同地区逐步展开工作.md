　　Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 23rd—The Fujian Provincial People's Government has adopted the "Draft Provisional Regulations on Rural Rent Reduction in New Liberated Areas of East China" drafted by the CCP Central Committee East China Bureau on September 15 of this year, officially announced its implementation, and is preparing to begin rural rent reduction work in Fujian Province in a step-by-step manner. To this end, the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently issued instructions on "How to Specifically Implement the Provisional Regulations on Rural Rent Reduction in New Liberated Areas of East China," calling on party cadres throughout the province to mobilize farmers, assist the government, and implement rent reduction decrees. The instructions first pointed out that currently, farmers in various parts of Fujian, especially in the old liberated areas during the Land Revolution War era and the areas that persisted in guerrilla warfare for more than ten years, urgently demand rent reduction. Therefore, all party members must face up to this demand of the farmers, mobilize and lead the farmers to achieve victory in rent reduction, implement government decrees, and promote farmers' active development of agricultural production after rent reduction. The Provincial Committee proposed in its instructions that rent reduction work should have different approaches in the three different types of areas in the province. The first type of area includes the old liberated areas that were liberated before the Anti-Japanese War; or areas that persisted in guerrilla warfare for more than ten years; or new areas where a grain-borrowing movement was launched after liberation to support the front lines, and the local people had an initial mobilization. In these areas, when bandits have been largely suppressed, there are people's governments above the district level, and a certain number of cadres, it is necessary to fully mobilize farmers, organize peasant associations, and carry out rent reduction to achieve the dominance of the basic people's masses in the countryside, further transform the rural government, and consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship. The second type of area is a new area where a few bandits are still carrying out activities, but most villages are controlled by the People's Government, and the broad masses of people have begun to approach us. In these areas, in addition to combining bandit suppression and the fight against local bullies to carry out general rent reduction propaganda and reasonable burden grain collection work, farmers should be mobilized in a focused manner to carry out rent reduction. The third type of area is a new area where bandits have not yet been wiped out, the countryside is ruled by bandits and feudal bullies, there are not enough cadres, and farmers dare not boldly approach us. These areas should first vigorously suppress bandits, oppose bullies, and implement fair and reasonable burdens, and combine the above work with rent reduction propaganda to prepare for mobilizing farmers to carry out rent reduction. The instructions also pointed out that in the work of implementing the Party's policies and government rent reduction decrees, it is necessary to strictly distinguish between the landlord class and the non-landlord class; distinguish between large landlords, bully landlords, and general small and medium landlords. Except for bully landlords (i.e., landlords in power), small and medium landlords who are willing to reduce rent to farmers can reduce rent according to the law, and do not uniformly adopt the method of struggle. We can welcome enlightened gentry who genuinely voluntarily reduce rent. As for workers, handicraftsmen, poor freelancers, poor families of revolutionary martyrs, families of revolutionary soldiers, and widows and orphans who rent out small amounts of land, rent may not be reduced or reduced less. The instructions finally proposed that Party organizations at all levels should educate party cadres to pay attention to farmers' rent reduction demands and overcome the idea of not daring to mobilize farmers to carry out rent reduction. They must help them closely combine rent reduction with bandit suppression, grain collection, and other tasks in their work, so that they understand that bandit suppression is an important prerequisite for rent reduction, and rent reduction can more deeply mobilize farmers and consolidate the victory already achieved in bandit suppression. At the same time, after rent reduction, on the basis of farmers being mobilized, grain collection work can also be successfully completed.

　　中共福建省委指示党员干部
　　协助政府贯彻减租
　　全省应分三种不同地区逐步展开工作
    【新华社福州二十三日电】福建省人民政府业已采纳了中共中央华东局于本年九月十五日拟订的华东新区农村减租暂行条例草案，予以明令公布实施，准备在福建省有步骤地开始进行农村减租工作。为此，中国共产党福建省委会特于日前发出“如何具体执行华东新区农村减租暂行条例”的指示，号召全省党员干部，发动农民，协助政府，贯彻减租法令。指示首先指出：目前福建各地农民，尤其是土地革命战争时代的老解放区和坚持了十几年游击战争地区的农民，迫切要求减租。因此，全体党员必须正视农民这一要求，去发动和领导农民取得减租的胜利，贯彻政府的法令，并在减租后推动农民积极发展农业生产。省委会在指示中提出：减租工作在该省三种不同的地区应各有不同的做法。第一种地区包括抗日战争以前曾经解放过的老解放区；或坚持了十几年游击战争的地区；或解放后曾经发动过借粮支援前线的运动，当地人民有过初步发动的新区。这些地区凡在土匪已大体肃清，有了区以上的人民政权和一定数量的干部时，就必须全面放手去发动农民，组织农会，进行减租，以达到建立农村中基本人民群众的优势，进一步改造乡村政权，巩固人民民主专政。第二种地区为少数土匪虽仍进行活动，但大部村庄已为人民政府所控制，广大人民已开始向我接近的新区。在这些地区除结合剿匪、反恶霸进行一般的减租宣传，和进行合理负担的征粮工作外，应有重点地发动农民，进行减租。第三种地区为土匪尚未肃清，乡村为土匪和封建恶霸所统治，干部不够，农民不敢大胆与我接近的新区。这些地区目前应首先大力剿匪，反对恶霸，和实行公平合理的负担，并结合以上工作进行减租宣传，作发动农民进行减租的准备工作。指示并指出：在执行党的政策和政府减租法令的工作中，必须严格区别地主阶级和非地主阶级；区别大地主、恶霸地主和一般中小地主。除对恶霸地主（即地主当权派）外，中小地主愿向农民减租者，可按法令减租，不要一律采取斗争的方式。对真正自愿减租的开明士绅，可表示欢迎。至于工人、手工业者、贫苦自由职业者、贫苦的革命烈士家属、革命军人家属，以及鳏寡孤独出租的少量土地，则可不减或少减。指示最后提出：各级党应教育党员干部重视农民减租要求，克服不敢发动农民进行减租的思想。必须帮助他们在工作中把减租与剿匪、征粮等任务紧密地结合起来，使他们认识剿匪为减租的重要前提，而减租则可更深入地发动农民，巩固剿匪已得胜利。同时减租后，在农民经过发动的基础上，征粮工作也可顺利完成。
