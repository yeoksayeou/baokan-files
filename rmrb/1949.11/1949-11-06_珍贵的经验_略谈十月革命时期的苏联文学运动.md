　　Precious Experience
    ——A Brief Discussion on the Soviet Literary Movement during the October Revolution
    Quan Lin
    Soviet literature has a glorious history of thirty-one years today. According to the general view of Soviet literary historians, these thirty-one years can be divided into three periods, among which the period from the October Revolution to the beginning of the socialist five-year plan construction, that is, from 1918 to 1930, is called the period of the birth and establishment of Soviet literature. During this period, most of the works took the reflection of the October Revolution and the domestic war as their basic theme. The most famous, and also the most familiar to Chinese journalists, such as Mayakovsky's many revolutionary agitation poems, Blok's "The Twelve," Serafimovich's "The Iron Flood," Fadeyev's "The Rout," Furmanov's "Chapayev," and later Sholokhov's "And Quiet Flows the Don," almost all revolve around a common theme to reflect the great historical content of the October Revolution era. This situation is quite similar to the fact that most of the outstanding writers in China today are focusing their writing on depicting revolutionary wars and the struggle of the people to turn themselves over; at the same time, when this young Soviet literature was born, it had to fight against all the remaining bourgeois reactionary literary thoughts on the one hand, and on the other hand, it had to explore its own creative path in this actual struggle, which is also very similar to the requirements of today's Chinese literary struggle. Therefore, today, when a new China is unfolding its cultural and artistic construction, it should be very beneficial for us to look back at the path taken by Soviet literature in the era of the October Revolution and learn from its experiences and lessons.
    In the early days of the October Revolution, the situation at home and abroad in the Soviet Union was much more difficult than it is in China today, and the bourgeois literary thought was also much stronger than it is in China today. However, the young Soviet literature finally quickly overcame everything, and in the first few years, it contributed a large number of immortal works with powerful artistic power as mentioned above. This is of course due to the fact that Soviet literature inherited the excellent tradition of people's literature since the 19th century, but more importantly, it cannot but be attributed to the leadership of the Party and the Soviet regime, and to the moving concern and help of Lenin and Stalin for literature and art. As early as 1905, Lenin pointed out that "the socialist proletariat should put forward the principle of party literature, develop this principle, and implement it as completely and completely as possible." After the October Revolution, in his conversation with Zetkin, he more clearly expounded this idea. Soviet writers during the October Revolution made their best efforts to practice Lenin's principle. The first task in literature is to affirm that Soviet literature is the literature of the revolutionary class and the Party. In the months after the October Revolution, revolutionary writers first broke away from reactionary bourgeois writers such as Bunin and Andreyev. During the New Economic Policy period, they also carried out a resolute struggle against bourgeois nationalists, against the tendency of art for art's sake (such as the "Serapion Brothers") and artistic individualism (such as the Symbolists), and later, they fought against the literary dualism of the Trotskyites and Bukharinites. In these struggles, the CPSU gave very important instructions and help to the literary movement. In 1920, Lenin drafted a famous draft resolution for the "Proletarian Culture" conference, firmly pointing out that "whether in the scope of general political and enlightenment education, or in the scope of specialized art, it should be infused with the spirit of the class struggle of the proletariat for the victorious implementation of its dictatorship, that is, to overthrow the bourgeoisie, eliminate classes, and abolish all exploitation of man by man." He opposed the tendency to try to oppose or separate literature and art from the Soviet regime, and refuted "all those theoretically incorrect and practically harmful fabrications of their own special culture." In 1925, under the guidance of Stalin, the CPSU issued a resolution on literary policy. This resolution more clearly pointed out that "the position of leadership in the field of literature, as well as all material and ideological resources, should belong to the working class. …The Party should assist these writers in creating for themselves the historical right to advance towards this leadership.” It requires writers to "on the one hand, fight against unconditional surrender, and on the other hand, fight against conceit—this should be our slogan. The Party also needs to fight against purely greenhouse 'proletarian culture' literary attempts. Grasping the vast phenomena and all complex situations, not confined to the scope of a factory, not Kirillov literature, but a great class literature that takes millions of peasants to fight after itself—is the realm of the content of proletarian literature."
    Literature should not only be subordinate to politics, but also to the policies of the Party. This principle was also put forward by Lenin in the early days of the October Revolution. Obviously, the Party's policy is the concrete manifestation of Bolshevik thought in practical action, and also the indication of historical laws. It is impossible for a realist writer to "attempt to seek creative freedom without following the strict instructions of history, without following the basic and organizational ideas of history." This idea, after a long period of education, was formally established in the charter of the Writers' Association in 1934, when the Writers' Association was established:
    The decisive conditions for the growth of literature—its artistic skills, its ideological and political fulfillment, and its practical driving force—lie in: the close and direct connection between the literary movement and the policies of the Party, the practical problems of the Soviet regime, the participation of writers in the active activities of socialist construction, and the careful and profound study of concrete reality.
    In short, during the October Revolution, that is, during the period of the birth and establishment of Soviet literature, a central issue in the Soviet literary movement was to establish the leadership of the proletariat and the Party over literature and art. During this period, there were countless literary groups in the Soviet Union, and the sectarian struggles and differences in creative issues were quite acute, but these contradictions were overcome one by one by adhering to Lenin's principle of Party literature. The consolidated unity and the high development of creative power in the Soviet literary circles in the later period originated from this ideological clarity and consistency. Here, we are given an important lesson: the revolutionary literary cause must be under the leadership of the proletariat and the Party, and become a part of the proletarian revolutionary cause, in order to have a victorious future; without the Party, without the class and the masses, its achievements are impossible.
    Another important experience of Soviet literature during the October Revolution was the exploration of creative methods. In the early days of the revolution, many poets, due to insufficient life and understanding, often liked to make empty and abstract praises of the revolution. The tendency of formalism also ran rampant for a while; on the other hand, decadent thoughts of the Western European bourgeoisie, such as futurism, symbolism, and constructivism, also invaded the field of Soviet literature and art. However, most of the outstanding writers have a firm direction, exploring a correct method that is suitable for revolutionary tasks and the needs of the masses. In this work, we should especially be grateful to the great teacher Gorky. He was a leading figure in socialist realism literature. His own creation is the best example of the method of realist creation. He asked writers to respect labor, study facts, grasp materials, and use simple and clear forms to write. After he returned to China, he advocated among young writers the use of artistic sketches and reportage, which not only enabled them to meet the urgent needs of revolutionary tasks, but also guided writers to life. This form, together with Mayakovsky's agitational poetry form in the early days of the revolution, became an important feature of Soviet literature in the first period. Gorky not only demanded simplicity and clarity in form, but also demanded that writers be able to realize the creative enthusiasm of the Soviet working people, as well as the affirmative spirit of being the masters of their own lives. He told writers to "place attention on what has begun to grow and move." He also said, "The working class's demand for art is very strict. They do not regard it as anything else, but only as a weapon to support them or oppose them."
    The experience and understanding of creative methods during the October Revolution, after continuous development in practice, until a conversation between Stalin and Gorky in 1932, Stalin clearly determined that the method of socialist realism creation should be the Soviet literary method. This method, due to the continued development of Zhdanov and many writers later, has more clear and rich content today.
    In addition, during the October Revolution, the issue of popularization of literature and art was particularly valued by the Party. In the Party's 1925 resolution on literary policy, it was clearly pointed out:
    It is necessary to advocate and create literature that truly supplies the mass readers - the readers of workers and peasants. We should boldly and resolutely break the aristocratic prejudices in literature, and create suitable forms that can be understood by millions of people by using all the skills of the old art.
    Due to such efforts, literature and art have been deeply rooted in the workers and peasants, and after 30 years, the cultural level of the Soviet people has been raised to such an amazing degree. It is said that today, the vast majority of the Soviet working masses are able to appreciate the highest-level literary and artistic works. The educational role of literature and art is elevated to the most important position in Soviet literary creation today.
    These historical experiences and lessons are the most valuable things for the Chinese literary and artistic circles today, and are worth studying and researching well. For thirty years, the Soviet literary movement has not only contributed brilliant achievements to the people of its own country, but also played a huge role in leading and promoting the revolutionary literary movement throughout the world; especially the Chinese literary movement, which can be said to have developed under the influence and help of Soviet literature for thirty years. This is not without reason. This proves the truth of what Gorky said: Bolshevism is the only fighting and leading ideology in creation and literature and art. It also proves another sentence by Zhdanov: Proletarian literature and art is the best literature and art in the world.

　　珍贵的经验
    ——略谈十月革命时期的苏联文学运动
    荃麟
    苏维埃文学到今天已经有三十一年辉煌的历史了。这三十一年的过程，照苏联文学史家一般的意见，可以划分为三个时期，其中从十月革命到社会主义五年计划建设开始以前，即一九一八到一九三○年期间，是被称做苏维埃文学诞生和成立的时期。这个时期中间，极大部分作品都是以反映十月革命和国内战争作为其基本主题。最著名的，也是被中国记者所最熟悉的，如玛耶阔夫斯基的许多革命鼓动诗篇，勃洛克的“十二个”，绥拉菲摩维支的“铁流”，法捷耶夫的“毁灭”，富曼诺夫的“夏伯阳”，以及稍后萧洛霍夫的“静静的顿河”等等，几乎都是环绕着一个共同的主题，来反映出十月革命时代伟大的历史内容。这情形，和今天中国大部分优秀作家，都集中其笔锋在描写革命战争和人民翻身斗争，颇有相似之处；同时，当这个年青的苏维埃文学出世的时候，它一方面要和一切残余的资产阶级反动文艺思想作斗争，一方面又要在这实际斗争中间探求其自己的创作道路，这和今天中国文艺斗争的要求，也正复相近。因此，在今天，当新的中国正在展开其文化和艺术建设的时候，让我们来回顾一下十月革命时代苏联文艺所走过的道路以及学习它的经验和教训，这对于我们应该是件很有益的事情。
    十月革命的初期，苏联国内外的情形，要比我们今天艰困得多，在文艺上，资产阶级文艺思想也要比在今天中国强大的多。但是年青的苏维埃文学终于迅速地战胜了一切，而在最初的几年中间，就贡献出上述一大批赋有强大艺术力量的不朽作品。这固然由于苏维埃文学是继承着十九世纪以来人民文学的优秀传统，但是更重要的，却不能不归功于党和苏维埃政权的领导，归功于列宁、斯大林对于文艺的那种令人感动的关心与帮助。远在一九○五年，列宁就指出“社会主义的无产阶级应当提出党的文学的原则，发展这个原则，并且尽可能在更完全和完整的方式里实行它。”十月革命以后，他和蔡特金的谈话中，更明确的发挥了这个思想。十月革命时期苏维埃作家即是以最大的努力，来实践列宁的这个原则。文学上第一个任务，即是肯定苏维埃文学是革命的阶级与党的文学。十月革命以后几个月中，革命的作家首先和反动的资产阶级作家，如蒲宁，安特列夫等分裂开来。在新经济政策时期又和资产阶级的民族主义者进行了坚决的斗争，和为艺术而艺术的倾向（如“塞拉比翁兄弟”）以及艺术个人主义（如象征派等）进行斗争，更后来，又和托洛斯基派，布哈林派那种文艺二元论进行了斗争。在这些斗争中间，联共党曾经给予文艺运动以非常重要的指示和帮助。一九二○年，列宁起草了一篇“无产阶级文化”大会的著名决议草案，坚决指出：“无论一般的政治——启蒙教育的范围，以及专门的艺术范围，都应该贯注着无产阶级为胜利地实行它的专政，即是推翻资产阶级，消灭阶级，取消一切人对人的剥削——阶级斗争的精神。”他反对那种企图把文艺和苏维埃政权对立或独立起来的倾向，驳斥“那种在理论上不正确及在实际上有害的一切杜撰出来自己的特别的文化”。一九二五年，在斯大林指导下，联共党又颁布一个关于文艺政策的决议。这个决议更明确的指出“文学领域上的指导的位置，以及所有一切物质的，意识形态的资源整个都要属于工人阶级。……党应该援助这些作家，自己造出进向这领导权的历史权利来”。它要求作家“一方面，和无条件的投降作斗争，别一方面，和自负作斗争——这应该是我们的标语。党对于纯温室底‘无产文化’文学底尝试，也有斗争的必要。把握广大现象和一切复杂情形，不局促于一个工厂范围之内，不是基尔特文学，却在自己之后，带着几百万的农民去斗争的伟大的阶级文学——才是无产阶级文学内容底境界。”
    文学不仅应该服从于政治，并且应该服从于党的政策。这个原则，也是列宁在十月革命初期提出来的，很明显的，党的政策就是布尔塞维克思想在实际行动中的具体表现，也就是历史法则的指示。现实主义的作家如果“企图不根据历史的严格指示，不根据历史底基本的，组织的思想而去找寻创作底自由”，那是不可能的。这个思想经过了长期的教育，一直到后来一九三四年作家协会成立时，正式在协会的规约上确立下来：
    文学——它的艺术技巧，它的思想和政治的充实性，以及它的实际动力——之成长的决定条件，就在于：文学运动与党的政策，苏维埃政权的实际问题有密切而直接的联系，作家参加了社会主义建设的积极活动，并且用心地深刻地研究了具体的现实。
    总之，十月革命时期，即是苏维埃文学的诞生与成立时期中，苏联文艺运动上一个中心问题，就是确立无产阶级和党对于文艺的领导。在这个时期中间，苏联存在着无数的文学团体，宗派的斗争和创作问题上的分歧是相当尖锐的，但是这些矛盾都由于坚持列宁的党的文学的原则而一一克服了。后一时期苏联文学界那种巩固的团结和创作力量的高度发扬，是从这种思想上明确和一致的基础上产生出来的。这里正是给了我们一个重要的教训：革命的文学事业必须是在无产阶级和党的领导之下，成为无产阶级革命事业的一部分，才有它胜利的前途；离开了党，离开了阶级和群众，它的成就是不可能的。
    十月革命时期，苏维埃文学上另一个重要的经验，就是关于创作方法上的探索。在革命的初期，许多诗人由于生活与认识的不足，常常喜欢对革命作空泛的，抽象的歌颂。公式主义的倾向也曾经泛滥一时；另一方面，如未来主义，象征主义，构成主义等等西欧资产阶级的堕落思想，也侵入到苏联文学艺术领域中来。但是大多数优秀的作家，却都有一个坚定的方向，在探索着一种适应于革命任务与群众需要的正确方法。在这个工作上，我们应该特别感激伟大的导师高尔基。他是社会主义现实主义文学一个起主导作用的人。他本身的创作就是现实主义创作方法最好的典型。他要求作家尊重劳动，研究事实，掌握材料，要求用朴素而鲜明的形式去写。当他回国以后，他在青年作家中间提倡采用艺术素描与报告文学的形式，这些形式不仅使它能够适应革命任务的迫切需要，而且引导作家走向生活。这种形式和革命初期玛耶阔夫斯基那种鼓动性的诗歌形式，在第一个时期中，成为苏维埃文学上一个重要的特色。高尔基不仅要求形式上的朴素和鲜明，并且要求作家能够实现苏联劳动人民那种充满创造性的劳动热情，以及对于自己是生活的主人的肯定精神。他告诉作家要把注意力“放置在已经开始生长和活动的东西上”。他并且说：“工人阶级对于艺术的要求是非常严峻的，他们不把它看作别的东西，而只看作是拥护他们或反对他们的一种武器。”
    在十月革命时期中关于创作方法的经验和认识，经过在实践中不断的发展，直到一九三二年斯大林和高尔基一次会谈中，才明确地由斯大林确定以社会主义现实主义创作方法作为苏维埃的文学方法。这个方法，由于后来日丹诺夫以及许多作家继续发展，今天已经有更明确和丰富的内容了。
    此外，在十月革命时期中，文艺大众化问题是被党所特别重视的。一九二五年党关于文艺政策的决议中，明白地指出：
    必须提倡，必须创造真正供给大众的读者——工人和农民的读者的文艺。我们应该大胆地，决定地打破文学上贵族主义的偏见，利用旧的艺术底一切技巧的到达，创造出为几百万人们所能理解那样的合适的形式来。
    由于这样的努力，才使文艺深入工农群众，经过三十年时间，使苏联人民的文化水平提高到那样惊人程度，据说今天苏联绝大多数的工人群众已经能够欣赏最高级的文艺作品了。文艺的教育作用在今天苏联文学创作上，被提高到最重要的地位。
    这一些历史的经验和教训，对于今天中国文艺界正是最宝贵的东西，值得我们好好去学习和研究。三十年来苏维埃文学运动，不仅对其自己国家人民贡献出灿烂的功绩，而且对于全世界革命文艺运动发挥了领导和推动的巨大作用；特别是中国文艺运动，三十年来可以说是在苏维埃文学的影响和帮助下发展开来的。这并不是没有原因的。这正是证明了高尔基所说的一句话的真理：布尔塞维克主义是创作上，文艺上唯一的、战斗的领导思想。也证明了日丹诺夫的另一句话：无产阶级的文艺是世界上最好的文艺。
