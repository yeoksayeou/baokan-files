　　How to Establish a Nursery?
    In order to cultivate orchards and develop afforestation, counties urgently need to build public and private nurseries to cultivate a large number of high-quality tree seedlings and fruit seedlings, in preparation for large-scale tree planting and afforestation movements in the future. Now, here are some general guidelines for establishing a nursery:
  　I. How to Choose a Nursery Site
    Sloping land, dry sandy land, and low-lying wetlands should not be selected as nursery land. First and second-class land should be used as much as possible, preferably soil that is slightly sandy (sandy loam) with convenient watering and drainage. Land surrounded by trees or walls on the northwest, or northeast and west sides is most suitable. It should also be close to the area where tree planting and afforestation are planned, to facilitate future transportation. At the same time, the land should be concentrated for cost-effective management.
  　II. Land Preparation
    1. Intensive Nursery
    The nursery is best in a square or rectangular shape to facilitate zoning and organization. The perimeter of the nursery must have main roads, and a large cart track should be built in the most convenient location. Parallel to the north-south main road, create zoning for seedbeds (i.e., ridges), with bed surfaces three feet wide and thirty feet long, and walkways (i.e., ridge boundaries) one foot two inches to one foot six inches wide, raised about three inches above the bed surface, and level, not inclined. A water inlet ditch should be set at one end of the bed for watering.
    2. Extensive Nursery
    To save labor, simplify management, and save costs, it is best to use extensive methods for raising seedlings under current conditions. The method is similar to that of wheat fields. First, plow and level the land, then use a hoe to create furrows one foot apart. Water thoroughly along the furrows. After the water has seeped in, scatter the soaked tree seeds or plant the fruit pits that have been buried for a winter along the furrows. Then smooth the soil, covering it with about an inch of soil, creating ridges three furrows wide. Only water after the seedlings have fully emerged.
  　III. Sowing
    The sowing season varies depending on the climate and tree species. For spring sowing, it is generally from mid-April to the end of May. Large seeds are best sown in autumn, but to prevent rodent damage, shallow pits can be dug to bury the fruit pits mixed with fine sand for a winter. After the shells crack in the spring of the following year, then plant them. Fruit pits that have not been buried, and hard-shelled large seeds, should be soaked in boiling water when sowing in the spring, and then soaked in cold water for four or five days, then buried for a period of time. After the seed coat cracks, then sow them. Ordinary seeds should be soaked in water first, and sown after they are fully swollen, to promote germination. When sowing fine seeds, the seedbed can be used. First, lightly press the bed surface with a wooden board to make it smooth, then scatter the seeds, covering them with one or two fen of soil. Press them lightly again with a wooden board and water thoroughly. After the water has seeped in, spread a thin layer of dry grass on top to prevent drying. If using large seeds, when planting in the seedbed, shallow north-south furrows one or two inches deep can be made on the bed surface, with a distance of about five inches between the furrows. Plant one seed every three inches, covering the soil with a thickness of about twice the thickness of the seed. Water frequently, and do not allow the bed surface to dry out, so that the buds will easily emerge from the soil.

　　怎样建立苗圃？
    为了培养果园，发展造林，目前各县急需建设公私苗圃，大量培养优良的树苗及果苗，以预备今后大规模开展植树造林运动，现在把设立苗圃的一般常识介绍如下：
  　一、怎样选择苗地
    凡倾斜地、干沙地、低湿地，都不要选作苗圃用地，要尽量选用头二等地，以稍带沙性（沙质壤土）而且浇水泄水都方便的，及在西北两面或东北西三面有树或墙等围绕的地最合适，并要靠近预备植树造林的地方，将来搬运还方便些，同时土地也要集中，对经营管理上才合算。
  　二、整地
    １、细作苗圃
    苗圃最好是正方形或长方形，区划与整理才便利，苗圃的周围，必须设有主要的道路，并且在最便利的地方，修成一条大车道，由南北主道向两边平行作苗床（即畦子）的区划，床面宽三尺，长三十尺，床间步道（即畦界）一尺二寸至一尺半，高出床面约三寸，要成水平，不可倾斜，床的一头设一灌水沟，以备灌水。
    ２、粗作苗圃
    为了节省劳动力，管理简易，并且节约经费起见，在目前条件下，最好采用粗作办法养苗，其方法和小麦田相似，先将耕耙平整的地，用耠子挑成一尺远的沟，顺沟浇透了水，水渗后顺沟撒泡好的树种籽或点种经一冬埋藏的果核，再把土擦平，稍盖上约一寸厚的土，作成三垅宽的畦子，等到苗全出来后才浇水。
  　三、播种
    播种时期，因气候树种而变动，春季播种，一般在四月中旬至五月底，大粒种籽，最好在秋后播种，但为防止鼠害，可挖浅窑将果核混上细沙埋一冬，第二年春天壳裂开以后再行点种。未经埋藏的果核及硬皮大粒种籽，春天播种时要用开水浸过，并放入凉水中泡四五天，再埋藏一个时期，种皮崩裂后，再行点播，普通种籽先浸入水中，俟饱涨后再种，以促进其发芽。播细粒种籽，可利用苗床，先用木板轻压床面，使其平滑，然后撒播种籽，覆土一二分厚为度，再用木板轻压一次，充分浇水，水渗后，在上面薄铺干草一层，以防干燥。若用大粒种籽，在苗床种时，可在床面作深一二寸的南北小沟，沟间距离约五寸，每隔三寸点播一粒，盖土的厚薄约为种籽厚的二倍，勤浇水，勿使床面干燥，芽即容易出土。
