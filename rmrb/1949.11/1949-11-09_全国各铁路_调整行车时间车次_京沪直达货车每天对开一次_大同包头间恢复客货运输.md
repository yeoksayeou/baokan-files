Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 8th: The Ministry of Railways, considering that the speed and capacity of railway lines nationwide have generally improved after major repairs, and to adapt to the significant winter transport tasks, has comprehensively adjusted the train schedules of national railways and issued a new "Winter Timetable," which will be implemented simultaneously on all railways nationwide on the 15th of this month. Taking Beijing as the center, the new travel times for direct express trains on the Beijing-Shanghai, Beijing-Shenyang, and Beijing-Manzhouli lines, running daily in both directions, are as follows: Beijing-Shanghai direct express train: Train No. 11 departs from Beijing at 16:25 daily and arrives in Shanghai at 05:06 on the third day; Train No. 12 departs from Shanghai at 19:55 daily and arrives in Beijing at 08:45 on the third day, with travel time shortened to approximately 36 hours and 50 minutes. Beijing-Shenyang direct express train: Train No. 3 departs from Beijing at 10:00 daily and arrives in Shenyang at 07:05 the next day; Train No. 4 departs from Shenyang at 23:24 daily and arrives in Beijing at 20:05 the next day, with travel time shortened to approximately 21 hours. Beijing-Manzhouli direct express train: Train No. 1 departs from Beijing Station at 21:00 daily and arrives in Manzhouli at 09:06 on the morning of the fourth day; Train No. 2 departs from Manzhouli at 19:00 daily and arrives in Beijing at 06:10 on the morning of the fourth day, with travel time of 55 to 57 hours. In addition to the above lines, the schedules of all railway lines nationwide have also been changed.

In addition, in order to strengthen the exchange of goods between the North and the South, the Ministry of Railways has stipulated that, starting from the 15th of this month, the number of direct freight trains between Beijing and Shanghai will be increased to one pair per day (previously three pairs per week). Twenty-one freight cars will be attached between Beijing and Xuzhou, and twenty-four freight cars will be attached between Xuzhou and Shanghai. Furthermore, transport between Datong and Baotou on the Jingbao Railway was previously suspended by order of the Ministry of Railways to prevent the spread of plague. Recently, after a thorough inspection by the Central Anti-Epidemic Committee, it has been proven that no plague has been found in Datong; meanwhile, the Suiyuan Province has established an anti-epidemic institution and strengthened quarantine work. Therefore, the Ministry of Railways has ordered that passenger and freight transport between Datong and Guisui and between Datong and Baotou be fully restored from the 6th of this month.

　　全国各铁路
  　调整行车时间车次
  　京沪直达货车每天对开一次
    大同包头间恢复客货运输
    【新华社北京八日电】铁道部鉴于全国铁路经大补修后，各线行车速度及线路容量均已普遍提高，为适应重大的冬季运输任务，特将全国铁路行车时刻全面调整，颁布新的“冬季运行表”，于本月十五日在全国各铁路同时实行。以北京为中心，每日对开一次的京沪、京沈和京满（满洲里）等线的新行车时间为：京沪直达快车：十一次车每天十六时二十五分由北京开出，第三天五时零六分到达上海；十二次车每天十九时五十五分由上海开出，第三天八时四十五分到达北京，途中行车时间均缩短为三十六小时五十分左右。京沈直达快车：三次车每天十时由北京开出，第二天七时零五分到沈阳；四次车每天二十三点二十四分由沈阳开出，第二天二十点零五分到达北京，走行时间均缩短为二十一小时左右。京满（满洲里）直达快车：一次车每天二十一点由北京站开出，第四天晨九点零六分到达满洲里；二次车每天十九点由满洲里开出，第四天晨六点十分到达北京，走行时间为五十五至五十七小时。除上述各线外，全国各铁路线亦均已改点。
    又讯：铁道部为加强南北物资交流，特规定自本月十五日起，京沪直达货车增加为每天对开一次（原为每星期三对开一次）。北京徐州间挂货车二十一辆；徐州上海间挂货车二十四辆。又京包线大同至包头间前因防止鼠疫传播，铁道部下令停止运转。近经中央防疫委员会严密检查结果，证明大同并未发现鼠疫；同时绥远省已成立防疫机构，检疫工作亦已加强。因此，铁道部特令自本月六日起，大同至归绥及大同至包头间的客货运输一律恢复。
