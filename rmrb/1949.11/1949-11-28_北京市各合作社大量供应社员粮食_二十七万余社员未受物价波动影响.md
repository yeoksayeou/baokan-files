　　[Beijing News] Beijing's cooperatives are supplying large quantities of grain to their members, and over 270,000 members have not been affected by price fluctuations. The amount of grain supplied by the Grain Branch to the cooperatives was 4,063,059 jin in September, which increased to 6,214,672 jin in October. In November, in just 21 days (from the 1st to the 21st), the grain supplied to the cooperatives had already reached 7,002,366 jin. The grain price at the cooperatives, from April to October, was on average 14.24% lower than the market price. During the price fluctuations on November 11th and 12th, the cooperative price was more than 60% lower than the market price. The prices of other daily necessities were also, on average, around 20% lower than market prices. When the Grain Branch distributes grain to the cooperatives, it also stipulates that payment can be made ten days later, which ensures that the cooperatives' grain prices are not affected by market price fluctuations. At the same time, there have been great improvements in the purchasing procedures for the cooperatives. For example, the Telecommunications Bureau Cooperative has established 15 cooperative branches to make it easier for members to purchase goods. Cooperatives at the Clothing Factory, Water Company, Post Office, and other units are able to provide grain to members on credit one or two days before payday. When members purchase grain, they mark their name, the type of grain, and the quantity purchased on the bag. The group leader then delivers the bags to the cooperative. Members pick them up after work, saving them time. Members generally say, "With the cooperative, we have a reliable source of support." Therefore, in November, the cooperatives have seen great development, and those who have not yet joined are clamoring to do so.

　　北京市各合作社大量供应社员粮食
  　二十七万余社员未受物价波动影响
    【北京讯】北京市各合作社大量供应社员粮食，二十七万余社员，未受物价波动影响。粮食分公司供给各合作社粮食的数量，九月份为四百零六万三千零五十九斤，十月份则增至六百二十一万四千六百七十二斤，十一月份仅二十一天（自一号至二十一号）即已供给各合作社粮食七百万零二千三百六十六斤。合作社的粮价，从四月至十月，平均低于市价百分之十四点二四。在十一月十一、十二两天物价波动时，合作社价则低于市价百分之六十以上。其他日用品价格，平均也都低于市价百分之二十左右。粮食分公司批给各合作社粮食时，并规定可在十天后交款，这样可使合作社粮食价格不受市场物价波动的影响。同时，在购买手续上，各合作社也有很大改进。如电信局合作社为使社员购买物品时方便，成立了十五处合作社分站。被服厂、自来水公司、邮政局等合作社，都能在发薪的前一两天赊给社员粮食。社员购粮时均将自己的姓名、购买粮种和购买数量标记在口袋上，由社员小组长统一将口袋交给合作社，社员下班时自己来取，免得耽误社员的时间。社员普遍反映说：“有了合作社，生活便有了靠山。”因此十一月份合作社有很大发展，未入社的亦纷纷要求加入。
