Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 27th. The East China Textile Industry Conference, which began on the 12th of this month, concluded on the 22nd, lasting eleven days. This conference was convened by the Textile Industry Department of the East China Financial and Economic Committee, and detailed discussions were held on important issues such as planned production in the textile industry and overcoming difficulties in raw cotton supply. Zeng Shan, Minister of the Central People's Government's Textile Industry Department, and Vice Minister Qian Zhiguang personally attended and gave instructions. After representatives of the textile industry from various regions of East China reported on the situation and held group discussions, the results of the group discussions were repeatedly studied at the general meeting, and finally a consensus was reached. The conference was summarized by Liu Shaowen, Minister of the Textile Industry Department of the East China Financial and Economic Committee, who pointed out: The central issue discussed at this conference was the production plan of the textile industry. After repeated discussions at this conference, a general production plan that is generally in line with reality has now been formulated based on overall calculation and comprehensive consideration, and the number of working days for state-owned textile factories in various regions of East China has been determined in order to prevent unplanned and blind production. Liu Shaowen also pointed out: We must strive to overcome the current difficulties in the supply of domestic raw cotton caused by the Kuomintang reactionaries' long-term dependence on foreign cotton and the destruction of the cotton industry, and do our best to promote cotton planting and increase cotton field area, so as to strive to achieve self-sufficiency in raw cotton supply within the next one to two years. Regarding the establishment of factory management committees in state-owned factories, the use of democratic methods to inspire workers to establish new labor attitudes and give full play to high labor enthusiasm, as well as the conclusion of collective contracts and the reform of unreasonable wage systems, Liu Shaowen requested that administrative personnel in charge of factories in various regions must carefully study these issues in cooperation with the trade unions, and then formulate detailed plans and implement them step by step. The conference adopted resolutions on the administrative organs and work tasks of the Textile Industry Department of the East China Financial and Economic Committee and the textile industry in Shandong, Subei, Sunan, Zhejiang, and Taiwan, which will soon be liberated, and resolved to submit them to the Central People's Government's Textile Industry Department for submission to the Central People's Government for approval and implementation.
