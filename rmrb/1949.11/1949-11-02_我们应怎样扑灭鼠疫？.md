How Should We Eradicate the Plague?
	Tong Yuheng

　　On October 5th, the plague was discovered in Bengbeng Village, Chahan League, Chahar Province, and then spread to Baoyuan, Kangbao, Zhangbei and other places. On the 25th, it spread from Zhangbei to the vicinity of Zhangjiakou. In the course of 20 days, it spread over 300 li, resulting in the deaths of 58 people. This poses a great threat to all the people of North China. The lesson of the plague epidemic in Northeast China in 1947 was that the number of deaths exceeded the total number of casualties in the entire year of the Liberation War, and the property loss was over 10 billion. This is a great threat and an urgent task. It is even more ferocious than our enemies on the front line. Therefore, we must act, fight, and organize the Party, government, army, and people to fight to eliminate the terrible plague!

　　Although the plague is terrible, we can eliminate it as long as we organize quickly and take effective measures. The reason why the plague was able to spread and develop in Chahar Province was because we failed to discover the plague in Chahan Bengbeng Village in time, and patients were not isolated and a blockade was not implemented in a timely fashion. If the patients had been isolated at that time and rats and fleas had been widely caught and exterminated, its development would not have exceeded one village. Therefore, fathers, elders, brothers, sisters, and villagers in the epidemic areas, do not panic. We must assist the government, follow the instructions of the Epidemic Prevention Committee, launch a plague eradication campaign, universally accept preventive vaccinations, and start catching rats and exterminating fleas, implement traffic control, and strictly enforce blockades, isolation, quarantine, publicity, etc. The experience of Northeast China tells us that as long as everyone is united and takes emergency measures, the plague can be completely eradicated.

　　Now, the most experienced epidemic prevention teams in Northeast China have arrived one after another, and a large number of rat vaccine drugs are being supplied continuously. With the efforts of the Party, government, army, and people of North China and all medical personnel, we will soon have enough strength to eliminate this fierce enemy – the plague.

　　At the same time, eradicating the plague is also the responsibility of all the people in non-epidemic areas. We must be vigilant, carry out widespread publicity campaigns, sanitation campaigns, and universal plague preventive vaccinations. If we discover or encounter suspicious patients, suspicious dead rats, or people running from epidemic areas, we must immediately report it to the local Epidemic Prevention Committee. For our own safety and the safety of our families, if patients are found in the family, ask epidemic prevention personnel to check for plague symptoms and dangers. If unexplained sudden deaths are found, report them immediately to the local epidemic prevention medical institutions or public security organs for immediate diagnosis and pathological anatomy. For the sake of the safety of the lives of the majority of people, it must be pointed out that only pathological autopsy can determine whether it is the plague so that appropriate and timely handling can be carried out, which is very important. We should eliminate all feudal superstitious ideas about autopsies in the past.

　　Here, we remember our mentor, the Canadian international friend Dr. Bethune, who made a great contribution to the medical work of the People's Liberation Army during the Anti-Japanese War. In his deathbed will, he asked his students to dissect his body and keep the bones forever as learning materials for the students. Today, for the sake of preserving everyone's lives, and for the sake of confirming the plague, what is wrong with performing individual autopsies on a small number of corpses?

　　It is very wrong and very dangerous to conceal the disease after contracting the plague, or to bury it secretly after death. If it is really the plague and it is concealed, it will immediately infect everyone in the family. Secretly burying the corpse will also make it spread quickly and widely. This harms oneself and everyone. If we discover such a situation, we must report it or expose it promptly, and never allow one person's selfishness to endanger everyone.

### 我们应怎样扑灭鼠疫？

　　我们应怎样扑灭鼠疫？
    佟愚恒
    十月五日察省察盟察汗崩崩村发现鼠疫，继而向宝源、康保、张北各地传染，二十五日再由张北传至张垣附近。在二十天的当中，蔓延三百余里，前后已死亡五十八人，这对全华北人民威胁很大。一九四七年东北流行鼠疫的教训，死亡数超过了全年解放战争伤亡总数，财产损失一百亿以上。这是一个莫大的威胁，这是一个急迫的任务，它甚至超过我们正面敌人的凶恶，因之我们要行动起来，战斗起来，党政军民组织起来，为消灭可怕的鼠疫而斗争！
    鼠疫虽然可怕，但我们只要迅速的组织起来，采取有效办法，是可以消灭它的。察省所以能够蔓延发展，是因我们对于察汗崩崩村的鼠疫，未及时发现，病人未及时隔离及实行封锁。如果当时把患者隔离了，广泛的捕鼠灭蚤，其发展的最高限度也不过仅其一个村。因之疫区的父老兄弟姊妹们，不要惊慌，我们要协助政府，听从防疫委员会的指示，展开扑灭鼠疫运动，普遍接受预防注射，大家动手捕鼠灭蚤，实行交通管制，严格封锁，隔离，检疫，宣传等。东北的经验告诉我们，只要大家万众一心紧急措施，鼠疫完全可以扑灭的。
    现在东北最有经验的防疫队，已先后到达，大量的鼠苗药品，都在源源不绝的供给。再加上华北党政军民及全体医务人员的努力，我们会很快，也有足够的力量，将这凶恶的敌人——鼠疫扑灭。
    同时扑灭鼠疫也是我们非疫区全体人民的责任。我们要警惕起来，开展广泛的宣传运动，清洁运动，普遍的作鼠疫预防注射，发现或遇到可疑的病人，可疑的死鼠，及遇有从疫区跑来的人等，我们都要马上报告当地的防疫委员会。为了自己的安全，和家族的安全，假如家族里发现病人，要请防疫人员检查，有否鼠疫症状和危险，如果发现病症不明突然暴死的，要立即报告当地防疫医疗机关或公安机关，马上进行诊查及病理解剖。为了大多数人性命的安全，特别指出：只有病理尸体解剖，方能判断出是否鼠疫，好进行适当的及时的处理，这是非常重要的。我们应扫除过去对解剖的一切封建迷信的想法。
    这里，我们想起了抗日时期，对人民解放军队医务工作有巨大贡献的，我们的导师，加拿大的国际朋友白求恩大夫，在他临终的遗嘱中，叫他的学生们将他的尸体解剖，将骨骼永远保留作为学生们的学习材料。而我们今天为了保全大家的生命，为了确诊鼠疫，进行个别的少数的尸体解剖又何尝不可呢？
    得鼠疫后，如有病隐瞒不报，或者死后偷偷掩埋，这是非常错误，非常危险的。假若真是鼠疫密而不报，会马上传染家中所有的人，偷偷掩埋尸体，也会使其迅速广泛的传染，这就是害了自己，又害了大家。我们发觉这样情形，要迅速报告或检举，绝不让一个人的自私而危害了大家。
