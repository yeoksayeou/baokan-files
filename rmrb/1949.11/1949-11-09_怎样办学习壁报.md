How to Organize a Study Wall Newspaper
　　Zhang Qiyao

Due to the difference in target audience, or rather, the difference in purpose, wall newspapers can be divided into two types: one is for outsiders, with the purpose of propaganda or educating others; the other is for people within the group, with the purpose of mutual learning and mutual criticism. The former is less common and will not be discussed here. This article will focus on the latter.

Among the various methods of learning, such as reading, holding discussion meetings, and publishing wall newspapers, wall newspapers are undoubtedly a good method of learning, and we should not ignore them. Through the method of wall newspapers, exposing one's thoughts nakedly for others to see, and expressing one's opinions without reservation, to carry out mutual learning and mutual criticism, this is precisely the best form to assist reading and discussion meetings. Because when holding discussion meetings, due to the lack of sufficient time for consideration, when exposing one's thoughts, it is often not clear enough, and sometimes even goes awry. In this way, people's criticism of you is not easy to target your thoughts. Through written form, this shortcoming can be corrected; at the same time, expressing opinions and exposing thoughts in writing is more rigorous and systematic, which can cultivate a habit of thinking more and considering problems more; it can also cultivate writing ability.

However, if it is not done well, and this learning method is not well mastered, then it will be difficult to achieve the above-mentioned purposes. To do a good job of wall newspapers, we must pay attention to the following points:

First of all, the number of people is a problem. How many people should participate in this wall newspaper group? It is best to have more than fifteen to forty or fifty people, joining two or three study groups, or using a class as a unit is most appropriate. Too few people will not feel interested, or feel the burden is too heavy; too many people will be distracted and show indifference.

Second, the content should be coordinated with the learning process and have a focus. For example, if the topic of study during this period is "class and class struggle," then the content of this issue of the wall newspaper should focus on the essence of class, the relationship between class struggle and social development, and linking class to one's own class origin and class position. If the topic of study during this period is "urban-rural relations," then this issue should focus on issues related to urban-rural relations. Because when studying a certain issue, there is psychological preparation, and people will pay special attention to that issue. The writers will not feel at a loss and not know where to start; the readers will also feel particularly close and interested.

Third, publication date: there should be regulations in advance, it is best to have a regular schedule. If this is the case, the wall newspaper will have considerable seriousness and can be sustained. Because without a fixed schedule, it is easy to delay, and one delay leads to another, until it is virtually declared discontinued. This laissez-faire attitude cannot produce a good wall newspaper.

Fourth, everyone must write, and it should not be monopolized by a few people. In a study group, some are good at writing, some are not good at writing; some like to write, some do not like to write, this is a fact. Therefore, in principle, there should be regulations, such as each person must write one article per issue or one article every two issues, do not exclude those who do not like to write or are not good at writing. The editors should take responsibility for urging and soliciting contributions. Otherwise, every issue will always see articles from those few who are good at writing, and lose the main purpose of organizing wall newspapers, which is learning, self-criticism, and mutual criticism.

Finally, under circumstances where material conditions permit, try to make it neat and beautiful, but it is not appropriate to over-decorate and waste materials. I remember once seeing a wall newspaper, because the wall was very high and large, the editors, in order to achieve a balance between the two, and to harmonize the wall newspaper with the wall, pasted the wall newspaper in the center of the wall. Although the appearance was very beautiful and matching, to see its content, it was necessary to use a ladder. Such problems should be avoided.

### 怎样办学习壁报

　　怎样办学习壁报
    张启瑶
    由于对象之不同，也可以说由于目的之不同，壁报可以分为二种，一种是给外面人看的，以宣传或教育他人为目的；一种是给自己团体内人看的，目的在互相学习与互相批评。前者比较不普遍，撇开不谈，本文所谈的是后面这一种。
    在学习的诸方式中，如阅读，开讨论会，办墙报等，无疑的壁报是一种很好的学习方法，我们不应忽视它。通过壁报的方式，把自己的思想赤裸裸的解剖给他人看，把自己的意见毫无保留地倾露出来，来进行互相学习，互相批评，这正是有助于阅读与开讨论会的最好形式。因为开讨论会时，由于没有足够的思虑时间，暴露自己的思想时，往往不够明朗，有时甚且走了样。如此，人家对你的批评，就不容易针对你的思想了。通过文字的方式，就可以矫正这一缺点；同时用文字发表意见与暴露思想，比较严密与系统化，可养成一种多思想多考虑问题的习惯；其他还能培养写作的能力。
    可是如果不将它搞好，没有好好掌握此一学习方式，那就难能达到上述目的。要搞好壁报，我们必须注意下列各点：
    首先是人数问题，多少人来参加这壁报团体，最好在十五人以上至四五十人，联合二三学习小组，或以一班为单位为最宜。人数太少，会不感到兴味，或感到负担太重；太多了，注意力分散，会表示淡漠。
    第二、内容要配合学习过程，要有重点，如这一段时期学习的课题为“阶级与阶级斗争”，那么这一期壁报的内容应该侧重阶级的本质，阶级斗争与社会发展的关系，及将阶级联系到自己的阶级出身与阶级立场上等问题。这一段时期学习的课题如果是“城乡关系”，那么这一期就应该侧重城乡关系有关的问题。因为学习某一问题时，心理上有所准备，对那一问题就会特别关心，写的人不会感到茫无头绪不知从何下笔；看的人呢，也就感到特别亲切与有兴趣了。
    第三、出刊日期：事前要有所规定，顶好能定期，如果这样的话，这壁报就有了相当的严肃性，而且能够持久。因为没有定期往往容易拖延，一延再延，一直到无形宣告停刊为止，这种任其自流的态度，是办不好壁报的。
    第四、大家都要写，不应该少数人包办。在一个学习团体里，有的长于写作，有的不长于写作；有的欢喜写作，有的不欢喜写作，这是事实。所以原则上要有所规定，如每期每人必须写一篇或二期一篇，不要不喜欢写或不长于写的人，就不叫他写。编者要负起敦促与索稿的责任来。不然，每期老是会看到那善于写、长于写的几个人的文章，而失去搞壁报为的是学习与自我批评与互相批评的主旨。
    末了，在物质条件允许情形之下。尽量的使之齐整与美观，可是又不宜过事装璜，徒耗物力。我记得有一次看到一张墙报，因为那墙很高大，编者为力求二者配合，使墙报与墙调和，将墙报张贴在墙中心，这样外表固然很好看很相称，可是要看其内容，就非用扶梯不可了，诸如此类的毛病，我们应该避免。
