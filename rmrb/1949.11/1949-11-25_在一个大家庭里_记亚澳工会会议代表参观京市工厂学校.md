　　In One Big Family
　　-- A Record of the Asian-Australasian Trade Union Conference Representatives Visiting Beijing Factories and Schools
　　As the car drove across the Lugou Bridge, the eleven representatives from the Soviet Union, Vietnam, Mongolia, Korea, and Burma participating in the Asian-Australasian Trade Union Conference inquired about the historical significance of the Lugou Bridge from the staff of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. At this time, workers, farmers, women, and students from the Changxindian Railway Machinery Factory, the Locomotive Depot, the Futon School, and the surrounding rural areas of Changxindian flocked to both sides of the road, applauding and cheering for the representatives. Young workers closely surrounded the cars carrying the representatives. Soviet representative Bessarabov was lifted high by four railway workers, and Vietnamese representative Liu Defu was pulled by a group of workers shaking his hand. In the Changxindian Machinery Factory, filled with lively internationalist enthusiasm, old worker Liu Bingpo, who had participated in the "February 7th" strike and been imprisoned by the reactionaries, shouted welcome slogans and excitedly shook hands with each of the eleven international friends.
　　Changxindian became a gathering place for the Asian working class brotherhood. A dozen children, six or seven years old, holding flowers and gifts, paid tribute to the representatives from various countries attending the Asian-Australasian Trade Union Conference on behalf of the workers of Changxindian. One child presented a newly made iron hammer to Vietnamese representative Liu Defu. The hammer was engraved with the following words: "The hammer smashes the old world; labor creates the new world." Workers from the Electrical Machinery Repair Factory presented a gift they had created themselves – waterproof oil sandpaper. Burmese representative Wen Weng, on behalf of the entire Burmese people, said to the workers of Changxindian: "You defeated Chiang Kai-shek, and we will certainly be able to complete the liberation of the Burmese people." Soviet representative Bessenov said: "Your warm hospitality makes me feel like I'm not in another country, but in one big family. I wouldn't mind staying here for a week."

　　Yesterday, international friends attending the Asian-Australasian Trade Union Conference visited the Renli Carpet Factory and were welcomed by the entire factory's employees.
　　In the workshop, the representatives shook hands firmly with the factory's union director – the veteran female worker of eighteen years, Lü Jingping. Although they could not convey what they wanted to say to each other due to language differences, a deep friendship could be fully seen from the simple and sincere expressions of both sides. The representatives smiled when they saw the workers busily engaged in production, their smiles so hearty and joyful.
　　The representatives inquired in detail about the living conditions of the workers at the Renli Factory and carefully inspected the factory's equipment, dormitories, dining hall, clinic... In the women's workshop, the little girl of female worker Lü Huiqing – Xiao Yan, was picked up by the representatives. The Vietnamese representative happily presented his Vietnamese trade union badge to the two-year-old toddler and personally pinned it on her. Xiao Yan, with her unskilled voice, sang the songs "The East is Red" and "Without the Communist Party, There Would Be No New China" to thank this international worker uncle.

　　At 10:00 AM on the 24th, comrades Zu Tiangong and others from the Propaganda and Education Department of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions accompanied international friends from Korea, Iran, Mongolia, and Malaya to visit the 70th Ordnance Factory. Responsible comrades from the factory's Party, government, labor union, and Youth League organizations, as well as more than one hundred workers from six workshops, went to Beixinqiao to welcome them. After the representatives got out of the car, female workers and young workers came forward to present flowers, and a small welcoming ceremony was held downstairs. Sun Jincheng, deputy director of the 70th Ordnance Factory's labor union, delivered a welcoming speech. The representatives from various countries who participated in the welcoming ceremony expressed their sincere respect to the Chinese working class and the leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao. The representative from Malaya, Lu Cheng, said: "We have learned experience from the Chinese workers, that is, to take up arms and fight against the enemy. We want to learn from China – our elder brother!"

　　Nine representatives from the Soviet Union, Mongolia, Korea, Ceylon, and Indonesia who attended the Asian-Australasian Trade Union Conference visited and lectured at Tsinghua University yesterday (the 24th). When the representatives entered the magnificent auditorium, more than 2,000 teachers, students, workers, and security personnel from the entire school erupted in warm applause and cheers. Professor Fei Xiaotong delivered a welcoming speech on behalf of all the teachers, students, workers, and security personnel of the school. Representatives from Ceylon, Korea, Mongolia, the Soviet Union, and Indonesia spoke successively. In their speeches, all the representatives paid tribute to the revolutionary Chinese students and encouraged the students of New China to study hard, play a role in the construction of New China, and jointly defend world peace. Teachers, students, workers, and security personnel from various departments of Tsinghua presented flags and gifts to the World Federation of Trade Unions and members of the Executive Bureau and the representatives who visited the school. The gifts included Jiangxi porcelain bottles, a specialty of China; Sichuan bamboo silk (on which the Chairman Mao's Long March poem was handwritten by a professor from the Department of Philosophy); Chinese abacuses; dissertations by professors from the Department of Electrical Engineering; and exquisite slide rules and compasses made by teachers and students from the Department of Mechanical Engineering; weather maps presented by the Department of Meteorology; and photos of the Miao people from Guizhou presented by the Department of Sociology, and many other items.

　　在一个大家庭里
    ——记亚澳工会会议代表参观京市工厂学校
    汽车驶过了芦沟桥，坐在汽车里的苏联、越南、蒙古、朝鲜和缅甸的十一位参加亚澳工会会议的代表都向中华全国总工会的工作员询问芦沟桥的事迹。这时候，从长辛店铁路机厂、机务段、扶轮学校中和长辛店附近的农村里涌来的工人、农民、妇女和学生，都站在公路两侧，向代表们鼓掌、欢呼。年青的工人们密密地包围了代表们乘坐的汽车，苏联代表别西阿诺夫被四位铁路工人高举起来，越南代表刘德福被一群工人拉着握手。在洋溢着生动的国际主义热情的长辛店的机厂里，参加过“二七”斗争，被反动派监禁过的老工人刘炳坡，高呼着欢迎口号，兴奋地和十一位国际朋友一一握手。
    长辛店变成了亚洲工人阶级兄弟会师的场所。十来个六七岁的男女幼童，抱着鲜花和礼物，代表长辛店工人向参加亚澳工会会议各国代表致敬。一个小孩把新制成的铁锤送给越南代表刘德福。铁锤上刻着下列的字迹：“铁锤打碎旧世界，劳动创造新世界。”电气机械修理厂的工人献出了他们自己创制的礼物——耐水油砂纸。缅甸代表温翁，代表全缅甸人民，向长辛店的工人说：“你们打败了蒋介石，我们也一定能完成缅甸人民的解放事业。”苏联代表别森诺夫说：你们的亲切招待，使我感觉到并不是在另外一个国家，而是在一个大家庭里一样，在这里住一个星期也不嫌长。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（陈迹）

    参加亚澳职工会议的国际朋友昨天参观仁立地毯厂，受到全厂职工的欢迎。
    在工作房里，代表们和该厂工会主任——十八年的老女工吕静平紧紧的握手，虽然他们因为语言不同，不能把自己所要说的话告给对方，但从双方那种淳朴真诚的表情上，完全可以看出深厚的友谊。代表们看见那些紧张生产的工人们，他们都笑了，笑得那么爽直和愉快。
    代表们详细的询问仁立工厂工人的生活情形、仔细的察看工厂里的设备，宿舍、食堂、卫生所……。在女工房里，女工吕惠卿的小女孩——小燕，被代表们抱起来，越南代表很愉快的将自己佩带的越南工会会章赠送给这个两周岁的娃娃，并亲自给她戴上。小燕以不熟练的喉咙唱出了“东方红”及“没有共产党就没有中国”的歌子，答谢这位国际的工人伯伯。　　　　　　　　　　（朱波）
