The Root Digger

   　　　　　(I)
    In Yangpo Gully lived a landlord named Hou Yintang, whose family had resided there for three generations. No one truly knew the extent of his wealth, only that out of the fifty households in the gully, only the Zhang family owned their land, while everyone else was his tenant. The outside of the gully was spacious with good soil, facing the sun, and yielded abundant harvests, so Hou Yintang hired two long-term laborers to cultivate it himself. The gully itself was shaded and had sandy soil, so he rented it out to the people living inside. Originally, this land had been reclaimed by the farmers. When Hou Yintang saw someone reclaiming land, he would wink and say intimately, "Eh! Reclaim away! Don't worry about this wasteland. You don't need oxen to farm!" Then he would whisper in your ear, "If you don't have seeds, our family has them. If you don't have a plow, our family has it. If you can't make it, come to our place for some money." When the farmer asked about the interest, he would say, "We're easy to deal with, we'll talk about it after the autumn harvest." But when autumn came, he would scowl, "Three pecks of rent per acre, and if you borrowed 1500 earlier in the spring, with 6% interest, that's 2400 total." The tenant would say, "After paying the government, it's all yours. Our land is poor and doesn't yield much." Hou would say, "Not a peck less!" This bottomless pit was never filled, no matter how much was poured in, eventually forcing people to lose both their land and themselves. From then on, Hou Yintang's livelihood became as solid as iron, while the farmers felt like they were carrying a mountain on their backs, unable to breathe. Because he exploited the farmers so harshly, they secretly called him Hou the Skinner. Hou's family had a long-term laborer named Hou Laoshi. Laoshi's father had also served the Hou family his entire life, and on his deathbed, he told Laoshi, "If you eat from someone else's bowl, you're under their control. Find another way to make a living!" Laoshi gritted his teeth and left with his wife and children. But at that time, it was the same everywhere. Even outside the gully, he was just serving someone else and farming. Seeing that they couldn't make a living, they sold their daughter for eighty dollars for travel expenses and crawled back again. They had only about twenty or thirty dollars left, and they asked someone to buy an acre of Hou's land with it. Hou the Skinner was not happy about this and went to pat Laoshi on the shoulder and said, "Ill-gotten gains don't enrich the poor. If you're destined to be poor, you'll be poor no matter where you go." He also said, "We have been friends for generations. How can I bear to see you starve? Come back to work..." From then on, Laoshi became Hou's man again. "You can cultivate that piece of land as well. Use manure and plows from our house. We'll take care of your food and clothing. Isn't that a bargain! -- We'll talk about the harvest later, we'll divide everything in two!" Hou the Skinner was afraid that Laoshi would hesitate, so he explained so much.
    Laoshi was truly honest, never complaining about the cold when freezing, nor the hunger when starving. Chopping grass, feeding cattle, carrying water, and sweeping the yard were all free labor. Laoshi thought, "We've endured generations of injustice. Enduring this little bit doesn't matter. I just hope that from now on, we won't have bad luck again and can be content with being half-starved and half-full."
    Recently, he often heard that the village cadres were holding meetings, but no one called him, and he didn't go.
    One day, early in the morning, Hou Laoshi saw men and women from the village entering the gully, walking and shouting. The vice-chairman of the farmers' association was also banging a gong:
    "Men and women, young and old, attend the meeting!"
    "Those who don't attend will be punished!"
    "Those who don't attend are landlords!" When Hou Laoshi heard that he would be punished, he quickly stood at the back of the crowd, not daring to ask anything, and followed the crowd confusedly into his master's courtyard. He saw his master smiling, wearing a tattered leather jacket, his long face yellowish, with his hands outstretched, urging everyone to sit. Some women and old men sat on the brick courtyard floor, while a group of young people shouted at the top of their lungs:
    "Hou the Skinner, we're here to settle accounts with you! Tell us the truth about how you exploited the poor!"
    "Down with the landlord!"
    Everyone shouted, and Hou Yintang spoke loudly, but the people sitting in the back couldn't hear what he was saying. When the shouting died down, Laoshi saw his master smiling and saying:
    "Fellow villagers, it's good to talk things out. We can discuss everything slowly. Take whatever you need. Isn't there land right in front of you, and seven sheep, kept at his aunt's house on the other side of the mountain? After the autumn harvest, we ate until now, and there are only four or five piculs of grain left. What else do we have? Just a poor mountain village..."
    "No, take out your silver ingots."
    "Hou Yintang, what did you use to oppress people!" The shouts didn't subside, but fewer people were shouting. Hou Yintang took another step closer to the crowd and said:
    "I used my property to oppress people... People call me a spendthrift, poor in half a year, all the money was spent on wives (meaning playing with women)..." Someone in the back said, "Well, that's right, this kid likes pretty women, and didn't save much money." Laoshi was only listening to the people next to him discussing, and didn't see exactly what happened. He saw a few people going up to grab and jostle his master a few times, and a little blood seeped out on his face. He thought, "If you want something, just say you want something, why bother doing this..." He wanted to walk out, but then he heard his master's tearful voice:
    "Honestly, there's nothing left. If the villagers really want it, his aunt has twenty dollars!" Then someone in front clapped their hands, and Laoshi, not knowing what was going on, clapped twice as well. The meeting was dismissed. Then the cadres assigned people to pull sheep and carry grain. No one asked him to go, so he walked away.

    　　　　(II)
    The struggle was raging, and the district cadres couldn't stay in the village all the time, but hurried to other villages. Then came the distribution of confiscated property and land. The village cadres and a group of farmers discussed dividing the land. The land was divided decisively. Hou Laoshi was listed in the second class, and no one objected. The cadres discussed giving Laoshi this poor pit (poor household) Hou's family's plowshare-shaped land. Laoshi didn't come when the land was discussed. The deputy director of the farmers' association went to call him, and he said, "Divide me however you want, we have no objection!" After the meeting, the director of the farmers' association personally said to him: Hou the Skinner's plowshare-shaped land is yours.
    "The land is mine, so what? Can I eat dirt clods?" Laoshi thought about the land and remembered his father, who had worked hard all his life and didn't have a piece of land in the end. Now this land was his? Would Hou the Skinner let go?" Laoshi's brows furrowed into a knot. Because of this suspicion, he was slow to act on the land. The neighbor, Niu Guan Hou Si, also asked him:
    "What are you going to plant on this plowshare-shaped land?"
    "We don't have livestock, we don't have manure. Establishing farming is impossible if you lack anything." Laoshi told the truth: "Besides, there's nothing to eat. In the past, I would borrow from whoever I farmed for... Don't think that people are poor, after all, they still have a bottom. They have everything they need." It seemed that he had some difficulties, but in reality, his biggest concern was that the land was not secure. It was better to earn a piece and eat a piece, living a life that was neither full nor starving to death. Laoshi went to the fields, leaving late and returning early, always fetching water or leading livestock for the landlord in the morning and evening. One day, at dusk, Laoshi had just tied the big ox to the trough for the landlord when he suddenly heard his master calling him from the window. He brushed off the dirt and entered the house. The house was brightly lit with a sesame oil lamp, and the lampstand was made of brass. Hou the Skinner's long, yellowish face, with his squinting eyes, made him sit down. Laoshi slowly sat on the edge of the kang and listened to him speak: "Laoshi, you have turned over this time, and you will definitely get rich in the future." This made Laoshi unable to figure out what he meant, and he didn't know what to answer, stuttering. Then he said: "I think you are a very honest person, that's why I am telling you my heartfelt words -- why don't you want that reed field? You can get benefits for nothing without any effort!" Hou Yintang's eyes were digging into Laoshi, as if he wanted to drill into his heart. Seeing that he didn't answer, he continued: "You don't have anything to eat, right? You can't farm if you don't have food in your belly. Don't worry, the weather has its ups and downs, and people have their thick and thin sides. We've been partners for two generations, so let's measure out two buckets of food for you first." Three good words warm people's hearts. As soon as Laoshi heard these words, he quickly said, "Master Hou, I can't eat yours for free. Let me continue to farm this plowshare-shaped land for you." Hou the Skinner was delighted, right in his heart. He showed a smile, but immediately lowered his eyelids and said: "We can handle our own affairs, others can't interfere."
    In the end, Hou the Skinner calculated on an abacus, deducting the two buckets of rice borrowed last winter, and then measuring out three more buckets, totaling five buckets of rice in exchange for a piece of land. No one gained, and no one was hurt. Laoshi did what he had always done!
    After this, as the seasons passed and the farm work became busy, no one argued with him about this matter, but the matter spread. Some people commented that Hou the Skinner was trying to win him over, and some said that Laoshi was backward. Niu Guan and others said this: such a small piece of land is not enough to catch the eye. The village cadres were annoyed with him. They knew he had nothing to eat, but they didn't care. They didn't call him to any more meetings.

    　　　　(III)
    Just after the beginning of autumn, when the crops were growing vigorously, one evening, Hou Laoshi was eating dinner in the cave when he suddenly heard someone calling him to a meeting outside. From the voice, Laoshi determined that it was Niu Guan Hou Si. The two were usually pretty good to each other. Sure enough, after a while, Hou Si ran in and forcibly dragged him away. Laoshi said unwillingly: "We have meetings every day, what's the point?"
    While talking, the two arrived at the meeting place. The meeting was held on the deputy director's kang. As soon as he stepped in one foot, he heard someone say:
    "Ten acres of land, nothing to eat, just learning from him so lazy, no one has anything to eat."
    "He was given land, and he sent it back to the Skinner with both hands. He deserves to starve to death."
    Laoshi's small red eyes searched for the speaker, who was the deputy director of the farmers' association. It turned out that this was a poor and hired peasants association, and the cadres who led the struggle also came to participate. The district cadres wanted to understand the situation in this village. Carefully paying attention to everyone speaking, he saw Hou Laoshi wearing a shoulder-exposing rag shirt, a skinny person, a small stature, with a bit of festering around his eyes. He squatted in the corner as soon as he entered the door. Several other people in the venue were talking about him:
    "He's an old ox that eats grass and can't afford to feed."
    "To say that the struggle is only skin deep." (Meaning not thorough)
    "The landlord said that the land reform was not good, eating well and wearing a small leather jacket. After the land reform, although there is less land, they eat well and wear leather jacket plus leather jacket!"
    "I didn't even get a pestle."
    "Just listen to the meeting, it's not up to us to say." The person who said this had a mouthful of white beard. It was Niu Guan Hou Si. Laoshi saw everyone was talking and heard someone scolding himself, so he mustered up his courage and said to that person:
    "What kind of land do I have, it's dog doesn't gnaw rabbit doesn't shit land."
    "Aren't you going to give it back to Hou the Skinner!" The person retorted, causing everyone to laugh. Laoshi looked at the district cadres, only to see him frowning, not saying anything or laughing. The honest man was angry and quietly sneaked home.

    The next day, the sun was two poles high, and the red sun shone on Laoshi's row of cave dwellings. This was a one-hole straight cave, dark inside with a kang. This cave was truly bad. In the summer, it was hot, and in the winter, the sun turned around, like falling into an ice cellar. As soon as it got dark, the gray wolf howled and touched it. Laoshi's woman and young son were bitten to death by this gray wolf. Now there was only a thirteen-year-old son left, who often went to the fields with his father.
    "Is Laoshi home?" Laoshi heard someone looking for him, stood up and looked outside, and saw the district cadres who had been at the meeting. He said inwardly: What a nuisance! The district cadres came in, and only felt a blackness in front of them. After a while, it lit up. He carefully looked at a broken mat on the earthen kang, with a thin-armed, thin-legged naked child sitting on it. The ground was hairy and scattered, with everything and nothing. When he asked Laoshi if he had eaten, he helped him to start a fire and carry water, constantly asking questions, but Laoshi ignored him. Suddenly he heard the district cadres ask about his situation, whether the village treated him well or not, Laoshi said:
    "It's not bad, I am a poor pauper, who can short me?" Laoshi later saw that the district cadres were very kind, dressed like the common people, so he chatted with him.
    After eating, he threw the bowl into the pot, and the two went to the ground. The little baby followed behind.

    　　　　(IV)
    On the hillside, it was dry and hot. The two worked hard and Laoshi asked the district cadres to take a break. Sitting on this high slope and chatting, Laoshi pointed to the green and white hillside. Although they were all hillsides, the ground was very different. Like Hou Si's long piece of land, it was close to the edge of the cliff. When it rained heavily, it would not be washed away. On the flat ground, the yellowish naked oats grew up, like a large piece of satin. The district cadres interrupted him and asked him:
    "Why is there so much grass on your land?" Laoshi sighed and said:
    "At the meeting, they said I had ten acres of land, what kind of land is this? 'Cat eyes' don't even grow, and this kid doesn't dare to go to the fields without being led, and I'm always working for the landlord, what doesn't it run wild?"
    "If I leave this land for a year, it won't be green. Like that year, we didn't have cattle, and it cost five dollars to hire cattle to plow. With ten acres of land, we harvested five dou of grain. Alas! In the autumn, one dollar bought two dou of grain!" Laoshi pointed to his land for the district cadres to see: "Just this palm-sized land is scattered on the top of the slope and the edge of the cliff. It's hard work, and the sparrows are ravaging it, where can I harvest grain..." As Laoshi spoke, his voice changed, and the little baby with thin legs and thin arms knelt on the sand and rubbed his eyes, his ribs clearly visible in the sun. The district cadres said:
    "If you say so, the rich people definitely don't say so, saying that Hou Laoshi is unlucky, lazy, and so much land is barren!"
    At this point, Laoshi remembered the landlord scolding him for being poor, as well as the sad things of selling his children and losing his wife. He told everything one by one. The district cadres listened with his head down and asked:
    "How much money do you earn working for the Hou family for a year?"
    "Two piculs of rice, nothing else!" Laoshi squeezed his eyes and his lips trembled a little.
    "How many pairs of shoes, how many sets of clothes do you wear?"
    "We poor people don't wear clothes, one pair of cotton pants for six years -- this dog, gets four pairs of shoes just going up the mountain."
    "How much does a pair of shoes cost?" Laoshi thought for a while and said:
    "Two dou of rice a pair, which is not enough to wear clothes!" The district cadres said again:
    "Not to mention the child's food and clothing, but your acre of land is in the hands of others, and you still give him rent! How much land do you farm for him?"
    "The two of us farm one hundred acres."
    "One acre of land yields one picul a year, how much should he get in a year. He earns you more than forty piculs a year..." After the district cadres calculated this way, Laoshi woke up as if from a dream, and suddenly stood up and shouted:
    "Oh, my life is here, what the hell am I earning!" The district cadres pressed him down again and said, "Don't worry, we can talk face to face, let's go to that meeting and say it."

    　　　　(V)
    Laoshi felt as if a heat was rising from his body. When he returned home, he swept the kang and the ground clean in one breath. A broken mat on the kang, a black stove on the ground, a rope, a sickle, a basket, and a bundle of grass were all the family property for survival. The cave had heating, and Laoshi didn't run outside. Besides, Hou the Skinner didn't see Laoshi coming, and the naked oats were yellow and would fall into the soil if he didn't cut them, so he sent his young boy to call him. The young boy skipped and jumped into Laoshi's doorway and shouted:
    "Laoshi, my dad is calling you!"
    "Good boy, do you still think it's the same as before, eating from your house, and being under your control?"
    The young boy told his father the original words, and his father cursed loudly:
    "Good for nothing, you're just messing around with them, aren't you afraid that the Jin Sui army will come and take you away."
    At this time, Laoshi saw that the district cadres were supporting him, and he became arrogant. He found Suozi, the shepherd in Gouzhang Village, as well as Widow Ma, and of course, Niu Guan Hou Si also arrived. They were all extremely poor, and no one cursed anyone. They all had one mind to hold a meeting.
    The sesame oil lamp was lit.
    "What I want is my person, the property may be fake, but the person is not fake. I want Hou the Skinner to pay for my life... so many people died sadly..." Widow Ma wiped her tears with her large collar.
    "Serving people is not as good as herding livestock. Rain, cold wind, when you think of it, tears fall from your heart instead of your eyes..." Hatred was revealed on the shepherd's dry face.
    "It's said that we've struggled, but his hair is thicker than our thighs!"
    "The accounts should be settled clearly, as they should be."
    "Yes! This time we want to dig up the roots!"
    That night, in Laoshi's cave, this force was twisted together. Outside the cave, the moon was bright, shining on this mountain gully, the forest, and the quiet river. The water was turning in the cracks of the stones...
    Laoshi had something on his mind, and he didn't close his eyes all night. He got up early in the morning. When he came out of the cave, he looked, and the mountain was still the same, black and embracing Yangpo Gully. The east was like someone had smeared a stroke of red color, connecting with the tops of the white poplar trees that were rushing loudly in the distance, what a joy!
    In the riverbed, Hou Si was herding the cattle. The cattle came out particularly early today. A black shadow came up, and it looked like Hou Yintang's long face. Laoshi was hesitant, and the other side replied:
    "Laoshi, you are really strange, why did you sell those green oats! I was about to eat them." Because Laoshi had nothing to eat, he sold the green seedlings painfully to relieve his current thirst.
    "Why didn't you ask me to buy them?" Hou the Skinner said, "You don't have anything to eat, let me measure some for you first?" Laoshi didn't answer, and his fists clenched tighter.
    "You also want to divide my land? Don't you think about it, your second brother was an officer in the Eighth Route Army early on! Aren't you afraid that the Central Army will come..." Hou the Skinner didn't expect Laoshi to dare to take action, and grabbed Hou the Skinner like a cat catching a mouse.
    "Brother Hou Si, take this old guy! Let's talk in the district." Hou Si jumped up from the riverbed and walked over, and the little baby ran out naked, watching the crowd coming around to greet the sun, someone was shouting on the left, someone was shouting on the right, shouting in one voice:
    "Digging up the tree to dig up the roots!"

　　刨树根的人

   　　　　　（一）
    阳坡沟有一个地主，叫侯银堂，住在这沟有祖孙三辈了。关于他的产业究竟有多厚，人们也摸不着底，只知道这沟里五十户人家，除张家两户种着地是自己的，别人都是佃他的地。这沟外面宽敞，地脉好，能见着阳坡，打的粮食多，所以侯银堂便雇了两个长工，自己种着。沟里背阴，又是沙板子，便分租给沟里人种。原来他这地，也是农民刨垦出来的。侯银堂见着谁去垦地，便挤着眼，亲热的说：“嗯！刨罢，这荒地，不用愁，种地不用牛！”接着把嘴递到你耳边说：“没种子咱家有，没犁咱家有，打不过转来，上咱家使个钱去。”农民问他多少利钱，他说：“咱爷们好办，秋后再说。”赶到秋收，他就把脸一沉：“一亩地，三斗租，春借一千五，加利六分，共二千四。”佃户说：“除官家的，都是你的，咱这地赖，多打不下。”侯说：“少一个也不行！”这无底洞是年年填年年填不满，结果还得连地带人赔进去。从此侯银堂的光景就铁打的一样，而农民身上就象压座大山，喘不过气来；皆因他如此苛刮农民，所以农民背地里叫他侯扒皮。侯家有个长工，叫侯老十，他爹也是伺奉侯家一辈子，临死嘱咐老十说：“端人家的碗，受人家的管，往后寻个别的门道过生活吧！”老十咬了咬牙，便带着老婆娃娃走了。那功夫，走遍天下一个样，在口外，无非也是伺候人，刨地，看看没法过，把个闺女卖了八十块钱做盘缠，又爬回来了，回来还剩个二头三十块的，托人弄情的买下侯家一亩地，侯扒皮不甘心，又过去拍着老十的肩膀说：“外财不富命穷人，命穷了走到天边也是穷。”又说：“咱这是子一辈父一辈的交情啦，我能忍心看你挨饿，还是回来干吧……”从此，老十就又成了侯家的人了。“那块地你也捎带着种上，使个粪啦犁啦咱家有。管你吃管你穿，这还不是便宜事！——收下了好说，两家伙分！”侯扒皮怕老十犹豫不定又解释了这么多。
    老十，人真老实，冻死不说冷，饿死不说饥。铡草、喂牛、挑水、扫院，这活算白搭；老十想：几辈子冤屈都受下了，受这点也不算什么，只盼着跟这往后，再也别走背运，闹个半饥半饱也就满意啦。
    近些日子，常听说村里干部们在开会，没人叫他，他也没去。
    有一天，大清早，侯老十看见村里的男男女女都进沟来了，一边走一边喊，农会副主任还敲着锣：
    “男女老少参加会咧！”
    “不参加挨罚！”
    “不参加的就是地主！”侯老十听见说挨罚，赶紧站到人群后边了，又不敢问，跟着人群迷迷糊糊地走进了东家院里，只见东家笑面迎了出来，披着破皮袄，长脸黄腊腊的，两手张开着，直让大家坐，有些妇女老汉就地坐在砖院地上，一伙青年直着嗓子喊：
    “侯扒皮，我们和你算帐来咧，把你剥削穷人的事着实说说吧！”
    “打倒地主！”
    众人喊着，侯银堂高声说着，坐在后面的人也听不出他说些什么。喊声静下来的时候，老十只见他东家笑嘻嘻地讲着：
    “众位乡亲父老，来了好说，有话咱慢慢商量，该拿啥咱拿啥，这不是眼面前摆着的是地，还有七只羊，寄放在山那边他姑姑家，秋里打下点粮食吃到如今，剩个四五石子，别的咱还有啥？一个穷山庄子……”
    “不行，把你那元宝拿出来。”
    “侯银堂，你拿啥压制人！”喊声没降低，只是喊的人不多。侯银堂又向群众靠近一步说：
    “我拿财产压制人……人家叫我花家子半年穷，钱都看媳妇（玩女人之意）花了……”后边不知谁在说：“嗯，不错，这小子好看媳妇，也没多攒下个钱。”侯老十只顾听旁边人议论，也没看准是怎么回事，见几个人上去抓闹了东家几把，脸皮上浸出点血，心想：“要东西说要东西，这可何苦呀……”想往外走，又听见东家带哭声的嗓音：
    “说实在的，啥也没有了，乡亲们实在要的话，他姑姑家还有二十块钱！”接着前面有人拍手，老十摸不着头脑也拍了两下，会就散了。接着是干部们指派人拉羊背粮食，没人让自己去，也就走开了。
    　　　　（二）
    斗争斗的热火朝天，区干部不能常在村里住，游个一趟又紧着赶到别的庄上了；紧接着是分浮财分地，村干部和一伙农民商量着把地就分啦，地分的干脆利嗦，把侯老十列在二等，谁也没提意见，干部们讨论出侯家那块犁铧尖地，填给老十这穷坑（穷户）。讨论土地时，老十没来，农会副主任去叫他，他说：“分我哪算哪，咱们没意见！”会后，农会主任又亲自对他说：侯扒皮那块犁铧尖地算他的了。
    “地算自己的了，又怎办呢？能啃土疙瘩？”侯老十思谋着地的事，想起自己的爹，扛活扛了一辈子，临了也没一块土，这会儿这地就算自己的啦？侯扒皮能放手？”侯老十的眉头，拧起个疙瘩，这么一犯疑，地就迟动了一步手，邻窑牛官侯四也问他：
    “这犁铧尖地种啥呀？”
    “咱是牲口没牲口，粪土没粪土，成立个养种（种地）缺什也不行。”老十尽说老实话：“再说又没吃的，往年是给谁种借谁家的……别看人家穷了，究竟还是有底，要啥有啥。”看起来他有那么些困难，实际上怕地不保险的心思最大，不如吃一颗挣一颗，过个沉（饱的意思）不死饿不死的日子。侯老十下地，迟出早归，对时一早一晚断不了给东家挑个水，牵个牲口什么的。这天，掌灯时候，老十刚把大犍牛给东家拴在槽上猛听得东家隔窗户喊他，他一面拍打着泥土，一面进到屋里，屋里亮堂堂地点着个麻油灯，灯台是黄铜的，坐在炕头上，显得干净＠嗦，侯扒皮那张腊黄长脸，眯缝着一双小眼让他坐，老十慢慢跨在炕沿上，听他说话：“老十，你们这回可是翻了身啦，日后定能发财。”这下弄的老十摸不透他的意思，不知答啥，吱吱唔唔地，他又说：“我品着你这人挺实诚，才和你说知心话哪——你咋不要那苇子地？不用下工夫白得利！”侯银堂的眼光挖着老十，象要钻到他心里，看看没回答，便又接着说：“没吃的吧？肚里没食，那能养种。不怕，天气有寒暖，人情有厚薄，咱们东伙两辈子啦，先跟我这量上二斗吃。”三句好话暖人心，老十一听这话，赶紧接着说：“侯大爷，我还能白吃你的，这犁铧尖地还算我给你种着吧。”侯扒皮这一下可乐了，正碰心眼，露了一下笑脸，马上又搭拉下眼皮说：“咱爷们事自己办，别人他可管不着。”
    临了，侯扒皮一磕打算盘，去年冬借的二斗米扣除，又量给三斗，和着是五斗米换了一块地，谁也不沾光，谁也不背伤，老十原来干啥，现在还干啥！
    赶这以后，跟着节令，农活忙啦，谁也没理论他这事，可是这事却传开了，有人评论说是侯扒皮拉拢他，有人说老十落后；牛官他们这么说：分那么点地，还不够点眼呢。村干部厌烦了他，明知道他没的吃也不管，以后开什么会就更不叫他了。
    　　　　（三）
    刚立秋，正是庄稼刷拉刷拉长的时候，一天黑间，侯老十正在窑里吃晚饭，猛听得外面有人叫去开会，凭声音老十断定那是牛官侯四，两人平常挺不错，果然，不大一会，侯四跑进来硬拉了他去，老十挺不乐意地说：“成天开会，开个＠。”
    话说中间，两个人来到会场。会议是在副主任大炕上开的，刚迈进一只脚，听见有人说：
    “十来亩地，没的吃，尽学他那么懒，谁也没吃的啦。”
    “分给他地，又双手给扒皮送回去，饿死活该。”
    老十小红眼忽展着搜寻着说话的人，正是农会副主任。原来这是一个贫雇农会，还有领导斗争的干部也来参加；区干部想了解一下这村情况。仔细注意每一个说话的人，只见侯老十穿的个露肩头破布衫，干瘦人，小个子，有点烂眼边带忽展眼，进门就蹲在墙角里了。会场里还有几个人在说他：
    “他那是吃了草皮喂不起的老牛。”
    “要说斗争，那是水过地皮湿。”（不彻底的意思）
    “人家地主说不土地改革吃的不好，穿的是小皮袄。土地改革了地虽少，吃好了，穿的是皮袄加皮袄！”
    “我连根碾棍也没分上。”
    “开会听一听，还不是人家说说算。”说这话的人一嘴花白胡须，正是牛官侯四。老十看见众人都说话，又听见有人骂自己，便壮了一下胆子，朝着那人说：
    “我那是啥地，我那是狗不啃兔子不拉屎的地。”
    “你不是再送给侯扒皮去！”那人驳他，引逗得大家都笑了。侯老十瞧瞧区干部，只见他拧着个眉头，没说也没笑，老实人生了气，悄悄溜回家去。
    就在第二天，太阳有两杆子高啦，红红地照着老十这一排窑洞。这是一个一孔直窑，里头黑古洞洞的有条炕，这窑真别气，夏天晒，冬天太阳转过去，就象掉在冰窖里；天一黑，灰狼长嚎，就摸上来了。老十女人和小儿子就叫这灰狼咬死了，现在还剩下个十三岁大儿，常跟他爹下地。
    “老十在家吗？”老十听有人找，站到地下往外一瞧，正是开会的那个区干部，心里直说：真麻＠烦！区干部走进来，只觉眼前一片黑，不大一会亮起来啦，细看土炕上一个破席片，坐着一个细胳膊细腿的光屁股孩子，地下毛毛草草，各里各落，啥也有啥也没有。一问老十还没吃饭，就帮着他烧火，提水，不住问这问那，老十不搭理。猛听得区干部问到自己的光景，村里对待好不好，老十便说：
    “都不赖，咱是个穷光蛋，谁能短下咱的？”老十后来看到区干部挺和气，穿的和老百姓一样，也就和他拉嗒起来了。
    吃罢饭，碗往锅里一摔，两个人下了地。小娃子在后边跟着跑。
    　　　　（四）
    山坡上，干巴巴的热，两人做活累了，侯老十拉区干部歇工。坐在这高坡上边拉嗒着，老十顺手指着，这绿一块白一块的山岗地，虽说都是岗地，可是地板差得多，象侯四那块长条地，紧在崖根，大雨下来，准冲不及，坪上那块地，黄腊腊的莜麦长起来，象一块大缎子。区干部打断他的话问他：
    “你这地咋这么些草？”老十唉了一声说：
    “会上他们还说我有十来亩地，这是啥地？‘猫眼睛’也不长，这娃子没人带领不敢下地，我又齐天在东家那里扑闹，指什不荒？”
    “我这地对一年就不绿，象那年咱没牛，雇牛耕花了五块钱，十来块地，秋里打下五斗谷。唉！秋里一块钱买二斗谷呀！”老十指给区干部看他的地：“就这巴掌大地，散落在坡顶崖根，又费劲，麻雀又糟踏，哪去收粮食……”老十说着说着嗓音就变了，小娃子细腿细胳膊跪在沙土上揉着眼，在阳光下肋骨照得显棱棱地。区干部说：
    “你这么说，财主保险不这么说，说侯老十倒运，懒汉，那么些地都荒啦！”
    话到这儿，侯老十想起东家骂自己命穷，还有走口卖儿女丧老婆伤心事来，一点一滴都说了出来。区干部低头听着，又问：
    “你给侯家干一年挣多少钱？”
    “二石米，啥再也没啦！”侯老十挤挤眼，嘴唇有点抖。
    “穿几对鞋，几身衣裳？”
    “咱这穷人不穿衣裳，一条棉裤穿六年——这狗日的，净上山得四对鞋。”
    “一对鞋多少钱？”老十想了想说：
    “二斗米一对，算起来不够穿衣裳哪！”区干部又说：
    “还没小娃子的吃穿哪，可是你那一亩地捉在人家手里，自己种，倒给他拿租！你给他种多少地？”
    “两人种一百亩。”
    “一亩地一年收一石，这一年该收多少。他一年赚你四十多石……”经区干部这么一算，老十象从梦中醒来一样，猛的站起来喊：
    “呵呀，这命就在这里，赚他妈的屁呀！”区干部又把他按下来，说：“别着急，有话咱脸对脸，上那大会上说去”。
    　　　　（五）
    侯老十觉得身上象有股热气往外冒，回得家来，一股气把炕上地下扫了个干净，炕上一个破席片，地下一个黑锅台，一条绳子，一把镰，一个篓，一抱草，这就是过光景的全部家产。窑里有了暖气，老十也不往外跑啦；再说侯扒皮不见老十来，莜麦黄腊腊地再不割便落在土里了，便打发小小子去叫他，小小子一蹦一跳进到老十门口喊：
    “老十，我爹叫你哪！”
    “好小子，你还当先前啦，端你家的碗，受你家管？”
    小小子把原话告给他爹，他爹高声骂道：
    “好东西，你就跟上他们胡闹，不怕晋绥军来了抬上你走了。”
    这会，侯老十见区干部给他撑腰，也就气粗啦，把沟掌村放羊的锁子哥找来，还有马寡妇，自然，牛官侯四也到了，都是穷的当当地响，谁也不骂谁，一个心眼开会。
    麻油灯点起来。
    “我要的是我那人，光景有假、人无假，我要侯扒皮赔命……人死的多寒心呀……”马寡妇用大襟擦着眼泪。
    “伺候人属不过放牲口，大雨淋，冷风刮，提起来眼不掉泪心掉泪。……”羊官干巴巴的脸上露着仇恨。
    “说是斗了，人家拔根汗毛比咱大腿还粗呢！”
    “帐就该算清楚，该咋是咋”。
    “对！这回刨树要刨根！”
    当天黑间，就在侯老十的窑里，拧起了这一股劲。窑外，月亮亮堂堂的，照着这山沟，树林，静静的小河，水在石头缝里打转。……
    老十心里有事，一夜没合眼，一扑明就起来啦，出得窑外来一瞧，山还是那样，黑黝黝地抱着阳坡沟，东方象谁抹了一笔红颜色，和远远的哗啦哗啦响着的白杨树顶接上啦，多么喜气呵！
    河槽里，侯四吆喝着牛群，今天牛群出得特别早，一个黑影，上来了，影影绰绰的看去象是侯银堂的长脸，老十心里一躇踌，那边可就答上话了：
    “老十，你这人真怪，为啥那么青莜麦卖啦！眼看吃到嘴啦。”老十因没一点吃的，疼心地把青苗卖啦，解解眼下这个困渴。
    “为啥不叫我买？”侯扒皮说：“你没吃，先跟这量点？”老十没答话，拳头捏的更紧了。
    “你也想分我的地呀？你也不想想，你二哥早当了八路军的官哪！你不怕中央军来……”侯扒皮没提防老十敢下手，一下子象猫抓耗子一样把侯扒皮抓上了。
    “侯四哥，拿上这老家伙！上区里说话。”侯四跟河槽里跳上来，也走过来，小娃子光着屁股也跑出来，看着迎着太阳围拢来的人群，左也有人嚷，右也有人嚷，一个声音的喊着：
    “刨树要刨根呀！”
