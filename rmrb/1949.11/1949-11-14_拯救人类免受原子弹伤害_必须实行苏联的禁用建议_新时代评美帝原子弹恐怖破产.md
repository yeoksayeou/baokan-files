    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 13th: According to a report from Electric News Agency, Moscow, 9th: The "New Era" weekly recently published an article entitled "Covering Yourself with Old Newspapers," commenting on the bankruptcy of the atomic terror manufactured by the American reactionaries and the ridiculous methods they promote for defending against atomic bombs. "New Era" first quoted the American magazine "Catholic World" as saying: We have the atomic bomb, but "we have not frightened others, but only frightened ourselves." "New Era" pointed out: Washington's strategists, not long ago, were still boasting wildly that the atomic bombs stored by the United States could destroy the whole world. But now their rhetoric is different. They say: The U.S. military is now organizing special training classes to eliminate American soldiers' fear of atomic bombs. A booklet called "How to Act During an Atomic Attack" is now being distributed among American soldiers, which says: "The situation is not as dark as some people think. An atomic bomb explosion is similar to a regular heavy bomb explosion. Immediately lie down when bombed, preferably in a trench or behind a wall. Cover yourself with anything at hand: clothes, cloth, or old newspapers. This will protect you from radiation." "New Era" commented: "The atomic bomb clearly cannot destroy the earth. The atomic bomb cannot determine the war. However, it is a barbaric weapon with massive destructive power. Humanity must be saved from the harm of this weapon." "New Era" pointed out that the way to save humanity is not to cover oneself with old newspapers, but to implement "the proposals made by the Soviet Union to the United Nations General Assembly, the realization of which will mean prohibiting the use of atomic weapons and other instruments of mass extermination of people."

    拯救人类免受原子弹伤害
    必须实行苏联的禁用建议
    新时代评美帝原子弹恐怖破产
    【新华社北京十三日电】据电通社莫斯科九日讯：“新时代”周刊顷以“用旧报纸盖在你身上”为题，评述美国反动派所制造的原子恐怖的破产与他们所宣传的防御原子弹的可笑方法。“新时代”首先援引美国杂志“天主教世界”的话说：我们握有原子弹，但是，“我们并没有吓住别人，却只是吓了我们自己”。“新时代”指出：华盛顿的战略家们，在不久以前都还狂吹：美国储存的原子弹，可以毁灭全世界。但是，现在他们的言论就不同了。他们说：美军现在组织特别训练班，以消除美国士兵对原子弹的恐惧。现在，在美国士兵中正散发一种叫做“在原子袭击时应如何动作”的小册子，其中说：“情形并不是象有人想的那样黑暗。原子弹的爆炸，与普通重炸弹的爆炸差不多。遇到轰炸时立即卧倒，最好是在濠沟里，或者在墙壁之后。把手边的任何东西盖在你身上：衣服、布，或者旧报纸。这样，就可以保护你不受辐射的侵袭。”“新时代”评论称：“原子弹显然不能毁灭地球。原子弹不能决定战争。但是，它是一个具有大规模破坏性的野蛮武器。必须拯救人类免受这种武器的伤害。”“新时代”指出拯救之道不是用旧报纸盖在身上，而是“苏联向联合国大会所提的建议，这些建议的实现，将意味着禁止使用原子武器及其他大规模屠杀人民的工具。”
