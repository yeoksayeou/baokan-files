Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 2nd—According to the Electrical Communication Agency, Sofia: The editor of the "Forward Newspaper," the organ of Yugoslav Communists in exile in Bulgaria, recently stated: Since August and September of last year, underground communist parties loyal to internationalism have been active within Yugoslavia. The first underground organizations were established in Belgrade and Montenegro and began to expand into Serbia, Croatia, Bosnia, and other industrial centers. Over the past year, the underground organizations have grown in both quantity and quality and have launched activities within the Yugoslav army. In Yugoslavia, severely punishing anyone caught listening to anti-Tito radio broadcasts is the norm. However, during the trial of Rajk in Hungary, radio listening groups were organized in many areas. The underground party organizations played a major role in enabling the people to learn lessons from the trial. They listened to the radio broadcasts and printed pamphlets from democratic Yugoslav political exiles. During these activities, the Tito clique continuously carried out massacres of democrats in Belgrade, Zagreb, Ljubljana, and other industrial centers.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 2nd—According to the Electrical Communication Agency, Toronto: The Canadian Southern Slav Committee here recently vehemently protested the Tito clique's mass arrest of three thousand Yugoslavs who had returned from Canada. Previously, hundreds of Yugoslav families had been deceived by Tito into returning to their homeland. These expatriates, who had fled to Canada to escape persecution by the former fascists, criticized and expressed disagreement with the Tito clique when they discovered that their aspirations to build a democratic homeland had been completely destroyed by the Tito elements and requested to return to Canada. As a result, they were subjected to mass arrests. The Canadian Southern Slav Committee issued a statement in the Yugoslav democratic newspaper "Unity" weekly, stating: The Canadian Southern Slav Committee, being aware of the pervasive terror in Yugoslavia and the suffering of Canadian Yugoslavs under the current regime, vehemently protests the bloody Tito regime's terror policies against innocent Yugoslavs.

　　南反铁托斗争扩大
    忠实于国际主义的共产党组织扩展至各工业中心及南国军队
    【新华社北京二日电】据电通社索非亚讯：流亡保加利亚的南斯拉夫共产党人机关报“前进报”编辑顷谈称：自去年八、九月以来，南斯拉夫国内忠实于国际主义的地下共产党一直在活动着。第一批地下组织是在贝尔格莱德和门的内哥罗建立的，并开始扩大到塞尔维亚、哥罗提亚、波斯尼亚及其它工业中心。在过去一年中，地下组织不论在数量与质量上都已增长了，并已在南斯拉夫军队里展开活动。在南斯拉夫，私听反铁托的无线电广播是要受到严惩的。但是，在匈牙利审判拉伊克期间，许多地区都组织了广播收听小组，各地下党组织在使人民自该审判案获得教训一点上，起了主要的作用。他们收听广播，并印发民主的南斯拉夫政治流亡者的小册子。在这些活动的过程中，铁托集团在贝尔格莱德、萨格勒布、利乌布略那及其他工业中心，曾不断进行了对民主分子的屠杀。
    【新华社北京二日电】据电通社多伦多讯：此间加拿大籍南方斯拉夫人委员会最近曾猛烈抗议铁托集团大批逮捕三千名由加拿大归国的南斯拉夫人。前此，数百个南斯拉夫家庭曾被铁托骗回祖国，他们都是因为逃避前法西斯的迫害而流亡到加拿大的。这些侨民被骗归国后，发现他们建设民主祖国的愿望已全被铁托分子所破坏时，曾对铁托集团加以批评，表示不能赞同，并要求仍回加拿大，因而遭受到大批逮捕。加籍南方斯拉夫人委员会在南斯拉夫民主报纸“团结”周报上发表声明称：加籍南方斯拉夫人委员会知悉在南斯拉夫所遍布的恐怖和加籍南斯拉夫人在现政权下所蒙受的痛苦后，猛烈抗议血腥的铁托政权对无辜的南斯拉夫人的这种恐怖政策。
