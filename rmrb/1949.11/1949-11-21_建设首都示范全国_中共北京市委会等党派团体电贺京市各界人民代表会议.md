    We warmly congratulate the convening of the Second Beijing People's Representative Conference and wish the conference success. In the capital of the People's Republic of China, you represent the will and aspirations of the two million people of Beijing, responding to Chairman Mao Zedong's great call, and in accordance with the provisions of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, this session of the People's Representative Conference exercises the functions and powers of the People's Congress. This conference is undoubtedly a good model in the history of our New Democratic political power construction, which proves that the political consciousness of the people of Beijing has been rapidly improved, and the people of the capital have been basically organized. We believe that in the future, the people of all walks of life in Beijing will be more closely united under the leadership of the Second Beijing People's Representative Conference and the Municipal People's Government they have elected, and will strive to further build the people's capital and win brilliant victories.
