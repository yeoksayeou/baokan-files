　　Enthusiasm Cannot Replace Policy
  　Miscellaneous Notes on Reading Drafts (12)
    Ya Qun
    A comrade who went to work in the countryside, after describing how interested he was in his work, probably found some people and some things displeasing. So he wrote with great relish:
    "…Some are ‘incorrigible,’ or are already beating a retreat. Fine, the revolutionary ranks need to purge these thoughts, let them roll away with their tangled dirty things, even their bureaucratism, commandism, liberalism, dogmatism, empiricism! What the revolution needs are intellectuals who can be won over, educated, and transformed, not just anyone."
    Because of his own revolutionary and work enthusiasm, it is not surprising that he is angered by some intellectuals who are not making much progress. However, if this kind of statement is used to explain the Party's policy towards intellectuals, or even becomes action, then it would be "off by a thousand miles"! Because the "isms" listed above are not only found in general intellectuals, but also in many Party cadres, some to one degree or another. If these people all "roll away," then what is there to "transform"? Therefore, the Party's policy, both inside and outside the Party, is to patiently unite and educate; and it specifically points out that it takes a long process of training to transform them well. It is definitely not about "letting them" "roll away together," and looking for intellectuals who are already free of these problems to "win over, educate, and transform."
    Take this enthusiastic comrade for example. He doesn't even realize that replacing policy with feelings like this inevitably leads to some subjective errors. Treating people with ideological problems, not considering how to patiently help them, but advocating "letting them" "roll away together," inevitably leads to some bureaucratic errors.
    Revolutionary enthusiasm is valuable, but if it is not refined by Marxism-Leninism and made to conform to policy, it will be harmful. Such a proposition may be enjoyable and straightforward, but it is completely inconsistent with the Party's policy towards intellectuals. It is not "fine" at all, but not good at all.

　　热情不能代替政策
  　读稿杂记之十二
    亚群
    一位到农村去工作的同志，描述一番自己对工作如何感兴趣之后，大概对于有些人，有些事不大顺眼，于是痛快淋漓地写道：
    “……有的‘孺子不可教也’，或自打退堂鼓。也好，革命阵营中要肃清这些思想，就让他们带着纠缠不清的脏东西，乃至官僚主义，命令主义，自由主义，教条主义，经验主义，一起滚吧！革命需要的是能够争取，教育和改造的知识分子，不是任何人。”
    因了自己有革命和工作的热情，看见一些不大长进的知识分子而生气，倒也不足怪，可是，假如依照这种说法来解释党对待知识分子的政策，甚或成为行动，那可“失之千里”了！因为以上罗列的这些“主义”，不仅一般的知识分子有，就是党员干部中，也有不少的人或彼或此，或少或多沾染了些，假如这些人都“一起滚吧”，那还“改造”什么呢？所以党的政策，不论党内党外，都是耐心地团结，教育；并且特别指出要经过长期地锻炼过程才改造得好，决不是“让他们”“一起滚吧”，而另外去寻找已经没有这些毛病的知识分子来“争取，教育和改造”。
    就以这位热情的同志来说吧，自己还不知道：象这样以感想代替政策，也就不免有些主观主义的错误了；对待有思想毛病的人，不是考虑如何耐心地去帮助，而主张“让他们”“一起滚吧”，也就不免有些官僚主义的错误了。
    革命的热情是宝贵的，但，如其不经过马列主义的提炼，而使之服从于政策，那反而是有害的。象这种主张，倒也痛快，干脆，可是完全不合乎党对待知识分子的政策。不仅不是“也好”，而是一点也不好。
