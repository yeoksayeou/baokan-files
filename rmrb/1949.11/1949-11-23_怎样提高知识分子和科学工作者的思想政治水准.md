How to Improve the Ideological and Political Level of Intellectuals and Scientific Workers
By Su·Kefdanov, Translated by Ye Qun

Our country is currently engaged in a struggle to rapidly advance the national economy and culture. This struggle requires the mobilization and intensification of the efforts of all workers to an unprecedented degree. Intellectuals play a particularly important role in this struggle. Their mission is to "develop science through their creative work, create new achievements in the scientific and technological aspects of the national economy, and inspire the creative initiative of workers and collective farm members." The further our country advances on the path of communism, the more significant the work of Soviet intellectuals in various sectors of socialist construction becomes. With the help of its intellectuals, the Soviet state has led the national economy, implemented its domestic and foreign policies, developed science and technology, and carried out the great work of educating the masses with communism. From this, we can clearly see the great significance of the ideological education and political training of intellectuals themselves.

Our country has educated this great army of scientific, technological, and cultural workers with the spirit of Soviet patriotism, the spirit of infinite loyalty to the socialist motherland, the spirit of Bolshevik party spirit, and the spirit of uncompromising struggle against unthinking adherence to convention, stagnation, backwardness, and other phenomena in science. The Party is making every effort to ensure that every scientific worker bravely studies current practical problems, becomes an innovator and creator, and works in accordance with Comrade Stalin's brilliant instructions on "on advanced science." This requires our Party organizations to systematically carry out the work of intellectuals, improve their political and ideological level, and help them overcome the old ideological remnants of kneeling down to capitalist culture, flattery, and belittling their own strength and the significance of Soviet science. Party organizations should be responsible for educating intellectual cadres with the great examples of patriotism and the scientific spirit of daring to raise questions (such as the examples of many Russian scientific giants such as Lomonosov, Mendeleev, Pavlov, Zhukovsky, and Pirogov). Soviet scholars should learn from the glorious example of Lenin and Stalin, the creators of our Party and the Soviet state, in their practical scientific work.

Comrade Stalin has more than once discussed the great role of combining science with the tasks of socialist construction and the practical work of the Soviet people. The close integration of science, culture, and the practical tasks of socialist construction can produce a huge practical transformative force. "Practice" is an inexhaustible source of new scientific popularization and invention. However, there are still many scholars and workers in research institutes and schools who do not understand this point and are unwilling to combine their scientific work with the current practical tasks of socialist construction. Moreover, there are still many "waste products" working in research institutes, who have not and cannot have any benefit to science or the practice of socialist construction.

In order to successfully carry out educational work among intellectuals, Party organizations should study issues with scientific content more, scientifically guide the research of important issues raised in the tasks of socialist construction, and resolutely combat anti-patriotism and anti-socialist behavior. Many Party organizations have not fully utilized the socially influential method of criticism and self-criticism in their ideological and political work, which means they have deprived themselves of a weapon that can better conduct the political education of intellectuals and mobilize them to overcome difficulties and shortcomings, and mobilize intellectuals to solve practical problems in socialist construction.

Recently, scientific creation seminars have developed widely. The experience of seminars conducted in the publishing industry and by scholars in Soviet universities and research institutes has shown that these seminars are the most effective form of promoting criticism and self-criticism and conducting the political education of intellectuals. These seminars are our most powerful assistant in directly improving scientific work.

Some of our Party organizations, after correctly understanding the significance of scientific seminars, have been able to widely use this form to carry out the ideological education of intellectuals and mobilize scientific workers to solve important problems in socialist construction. Sometimes they have also shown initiative in organizing such seminars. The Party Committee of the Department of Economics of Leningrad University took the initiative to hold a seminar in September on Professor Rukin-Fried's book "American Industry and War." As everyone knows, this book has been severely criticized in the national newspaper "Culture and Life." The basic shortcoming of Professor Rukin-Fried's book lies in his defense of American capitalist industry. After describing and analyzing the materials from a special objective standpoint, the author easily believed and used the materials of the bourgeoisie, followed the Americans' tail, and "contributed" ideologically poisonous books to Soviet readers.

All the speeches at the seminar severely and sharply criticized Professor Rukin-Fried. At the end of the seminar, Professor Rukin-Fried admitted the objective position of his book and believed that the criticisms made in many speeches at the meeting were unconditionally correct. Although Professor Rukin-Fried made reservations on several issues, his excuse was that the restrictions of diplomatic conditions prevented him from openly expressing his attitude towards American monopolists. However, the seminar has finally achieved its purpose. The seminar has become a special form of school for the ideological education of all comrades attending the meeting.

Here we give another example. Not long ago, a seminar was held on the fourth part of the textbook "History Course of State and Law". This book was collectively created by Professor Gurevich, Turgenev, and Charon and other workers of the All-Soviet Institute of Legal Studies. The seminar put forward many sharp and important criticisms of this book, believing that it lacked analysis of the general characteristics of the imperialist stage, pointed out that it did not reveal the mutual contradictions between imperialist countries, and believed that it did not make due critical analysis when describing the laws of social development in capitalist countries. Although this textbook was basically approved by the seminar, there is no doubt that the seminar can help the author make many necessary corrections (these corrections were agreed to by the author himself). Another benefit of the seminar is that it raised many immature but important questions about the science of the history of state and law itself.

Similarly, some other seminars held recently in the fields of science, technology, and culture fully confirmed how important and vivid this form of developing creative criticism and self-criticism is. However, it is a pity that not all scientific departments now regard this creative seminar as one of the basic working methods. Many Party organizations have not often shown their necessary initiative in this work. why? This is because they did not see the need to organize such serious, practical, and content-rich seminars, often expressing some concerns, thinking that "the seminar can't get anything," and expressing fear of criticism and self-criticism. The method of scientific seminars should become the law of life in all scientific departments and all advanced specialized schools, and Party organizations must often pay attention to this kind of seminar. Regard it as the Party's political work among intellectuals.

Of course, Party organizations must pay attention to making criticism principled and sound, and must not allow criticism to go to extremes and go too far, to gloss over and cover up shortcomings and mistakes, and to be afraid of offending any scholar or spoiling their relationship with scholars. This is wrong. It is also wrong to make general and inappropriate slanders and attacks on scholars belonging to scientific factions that they are dissatisfied with. This attitude can never bring benefits to our cause. This attitude not only cannot help us develop science, but is a serious obstacle to scientific development. However, many of our Party organizations often cannot fully explain this seemingly ordinary truth, and are not doing enough to educate scientific cadres with the spirit of criticism that can develop scientific truth rather than only paying attention to "trivial matters", and with the Bolshevik principled spirit of criticism. Party organizations must fight to ensure that scientific seminars can be conducted at a high level of principle.

Better organization and correct leadership of scientific seminars is of great significance for promoting the enthusiasm of intellectual cadres and for cultivating a collective work style in scientific work. Now, the development of science itself has entered such a level that many scientific problems cannot be solved by individual scholars alone. The solution of many scientific problems requires the general mobilization of all scientific groups, and sometimes even the total cooperation of all the scientific forces of several scientific research institutes. This point is especially clear in the scientific research of new technologies. However, the work of some of our scientific research institutes is still dominated by a petty-bourgeois individualistic ideology, and some of our scholars still want to continue to confine and block themselves in a narrow circle - they only study scientific problems that they personally find interesting, and are indifferent to the most important and practical scientific problems in collective research at present. We should widely discuss many works, and should take the work that is secretly carried out in the house to collective seminars - this is the best way to fight against the "patriarchal system" in scientific, technological and cultural work that makes people unbearable.

Scientific seminars have greatly improved the political and ideological level of scientific workers, enabling them to systematically work in mastering Marxist-Leninist theory, mastering dialectical materialism methods, and unifying correct scientific creation methods. Scientific seminars can help us eliminate the ideological remnants in the consciousness of some intellectual representatives, qualitatively help them transform themselves into new Soviet people, and enable them to receive the education of great and noble Soviet patriotism.

The great role of scientific seminars is to educate our intellectuals with a high degree of party spirit. Some of our scholars have become extremely vulgar objectivists, forgetting the class and party spirit on the front lines of scientific culture and everything else, forgetting our characteristics in this current stage of sharp struggle between advanced and reactionary forces. This is extremely harmful and intolerable. At present, the science and culture of capitalism are serving the imperialist forces, while in our country, a real, advanced, and people's socialist culture is developing, and a new socialist science is developing. This science serves the interests of the people and is able to help the people further develop the productive forces and further improve working conditions and living conditions. This science is contributing brilliant achievements materially and spiritually to the Soviet people, making them increasingly rich. Therefore, in our country, science has another situation that is fundamentally different from that of imperialist countries, and fundamentally different tasks are placed before this different situation. Imperialism is dividing science, making science increasingly degenerate and corrupt, and turning the science of the entire century into a tool of reactionary class forces. This capitalist world science is fundamentally different and hostile to the advanced Soviet science that is integrated with the people and becomes a huge force in the hands of the people to build a new communist society.

In our country, some individual scientists, forgetting the class and party spirit of science, have fallen into the abyss of serious mistakes. Forgetting the class principle of social sciences, for example, forgetting that the history of society is the history of class struggle, has caused some of our historians of Kazakhstan, Ukraine, and Moldavia to make bourgeois nationalist mistakes when explaining historical issues. The incident of Professor Zhebrak is also a painful example of scientific indifference to politics. Professor Zhebrak forgot the most basic obligations of a Soviet citizen: he not only failed to strongly attack the biology written by the famous fascist reactionary theorist Misaks, but he also got together with them to develop what world biology, kowtowing to the fascists, and slandering and criticizing excellent Soviet scholars. Therefore, he committed the crime of opposing patriotism and was righteously and sternly refuted by the Soviet social science community.

Some scholars here still maintain an attitude of not criticizing capitalist viewpoints. Take Professor Goresnev's book "Socialist Agricultural Organization" as an example. What is particularly intolerable about this book is his description of advanced foreign agricultural technology. In this book, the author praised American and German technology without restriction and without measure, but he did not explain the specific contradictions between advanced technology and the capitalist social system, nor did he explain that Russia's excellent scholars and technicians are making great strides in the work of socialist agricultural mechanization. Finally, the author did not explain the most important principle, that is, true and indestructible advanced agricultural technology is only possible under socialist conditions. Nor did it explain that the Soviet Union's achievements in agricultural mechanization are unprecedented. The author's own incorrect anti-truth attitude has led him to form such a wrong idea that only the United States and Germany can have good agricultural machine manufacturing, and that our country's agricultural machinery manufacturing industry should blindly imitate and rely on the United States and Germany. Although, the whole world knows that many machines produced by the Soviet motherland are the best machines in the world.

Like the above-mentioned seminars, other extensive critical seminars of similar work have great educational significance in enabling intellectual cadres to understand the due party attitude towards capitalist science and technology, and in promoting their new and courageous creative spirit to solve technical problems. The spirit of fighting against adherence to conventions and following the old ways, the spirit of daring to create new production methods, and new machines and equipment, are the practical manifestations of the truly patriotic spirit of intellectuals in our scientific and technological circles. Through scientific seminars, Party organizations can decisively fight against the old ideological remnants in the minds of some of our engineers and technical intellectuals, especially to help them get rid of the erroneous views that only American monopolists and other technologically developed capitalist countries can have the best machine manufacturing. Tell them that there was a time when the Soviet state had to obtain technical assistance from foreign experts, but that time has long passed, and our intellectuals have gained such experience that we can learn all the skills of all foreign experts.

Since the establishment of the Soviet regime, especially during the implementation of the Stalin Five-Year Plan, our motherland has made great progress in technology. If we were once technologically dependent on capitalist countries in the past, then we are not and cannot say so now. We have created sufficient conditions to enable our country to not only catch up with but also surpass all other countries in all scientific and technological achievements in a short period of time. When using socialist construction and all technological achievements, we should not forget the issue of bravely opening up new roads in science and technology, we should explore reasonable methods for solving many scientific and technological problems in the national economy, and we should always remember Comrade Stalin's words: "It is often the case that the pioneers of new scientific and technological roads are often not well-known figures in the scientific community, but those scientific workers who have no fame, ordinary people, and creators of ordinary practice and undertakings." Party organizations should cultivate cadres through scientific discussions so that they pay attention to studying daily experience, summarize and develop these experiences, and embody the experience in practical life. Make them understand that many newcomers can become advanced Stakhanovites in industry and agriculture. The announcement of the Stalin Prize says that it is necessary to constantly emerge Stakhanovites who are good at creating new technological methods and new labor methods to promote the cause of science.

We are repeatedly convinced that scientific seminars can become the most effective way to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of various scientific works in a principled, broad, and in-depth manner. We should emphatically point out that the timely and correct organization of scientific seminars can help us prevent the publication of erroneous books and discussions, and free our publications and the vast number of readers from inevitable errors (because once a book is published, it becomes a "fait accompli". Only the frequent holding of scientific seminars can prevent this "fait accompli").

When using the method of scientific seminars, while promoting the necessary independent initiative, Party organizations should fight against the vulgar non-Party behavior of some scientific workers, and should cultivate a noble spirit of patriotism. Party organizations should gradually increase the intellectuals' love for our people, and should make them more efforts to contribute new spiritual and material valuable achievements to our people, and should make them see the development and happiness of our people. The practical significance of scientific seminars is indisputable. The convening of scientific seminars has made many scientific cadres urgently demand the development of criticism and self-criticism. The method of scientific seminars should become the most important link in the Party's ideological education of scientific cadres; should become the most important link in mobilizing tens of millions of Soviet scientific workers to solve practical problems in socialist construction; should become the most important link in solving the important tasks of industrial construction, collective agricultural construction, and Soviet socialist cultural construction.

　　怎样提高知识分子和科学工作者的思想政治水准
    苏·克夫丹诺夫作　叶群译
    我国正在进行着迅速推进国民经济和文化的斗争，这个斗争需要把一切劳动者的力量，空前地动员起来，紧张起来。我们的知识分子在这一斗争中是起着特别重要的作用的，知识分子的使命在于“以自己的富于创造性的工作发展科学，在国民经济的科学技术方面创造新的成就，启发工人、集体农庄庄员们的创造方面的主动性。”我国在共产党主义道路上越向前进，那么，在社会主义建设各部门苏维埃知识分子的工作就越有重大的意义。苏维埃国家已在自己的知识分子的帮助下，领导了国民经济，执行了自己的对内对外的政策，发展了科学和技术，进行了以共产主义来教育群众的伟大工作。由此，我们就可以清楚的看到知识分子本身思想教育及政治锻炼的任务是有着怎样重大的意义。
    我国已用苏维埃爱国主义的精神，对社会主义祖国无限忠诚的精神，布尔什维克党性的精神和对科学方面的无思想、墨守成规、迟滞、落后等现象进行不妥协斗争的精神，教育了我们这支科学、技术和文化工作的大军。党用一切努力争取使每一科学工作者勇敢地研究目前的实际问题，使他们成为革新的创造者，使他们能按照斯大林同志“论前进的科学”的英明指示来进行工作。这就要要求我们党的组织有系统的进行知识分子干部的工作，提高他们的政治思想水准，帮助他们克服那些对资本主义文化屈膝称奴、奉承阿谀和轻视自己力量、轻视苏维埃科学意义等旧的思想残余。党的组织应负责以爱国主义和勇于提出问题等科学创造精神的伟大范例（如象罗蒙诺索夫、门德列夫、巴夫洛夫、朱可夫斯基、彼罗果夫等许多俄国科学界巨匠那样的范例）来教育知识分子干部，苏维埃的学者在自己的实际科学工作中应学习我党与苏维埃国家创造者——列宁、斯大林的光荣榜样。
    斯大林同志不只一次的论到科学和社会主义建设任务和苏维埃人民实际工作相联系结合的伟大作用。科学、文化与社会主义建设的实际任务紧密结合之后就能产生巨大的实际的改造力量。“实践”——是新科学的普及和发明的取之不尽用之不竭的泉源。然而不明了这一点的人，不肯把自己的科学工作同社会主义建设当前实际任务联系结合的学者们及研究院、学校的工作者们，还大有人在。而且还有不少的“废物们”，他们工作在研究院里，然而他们对科学、对社会主义建设的实践都没有和不可能有任何益处。
    为了胜利地进行知识分子中的教育工作，党的组织应当更多的研究具有科学内容的问题，应当科学地指导那些社会主义建设任务中所提出的重要问题的研究，应当坚决地与反爱国主义，反社会主义的行为进行斗争。很多党的组织在其思想政治工作方面，没有充分的利用批评和自我批评这个具有社会影响的方法，也就是说他们剥夺了自己的武器，而这个武器是能够更多地进行知识分子政治教育的，是能够动员知识分子克服困难、缺点，动员知识分子来解决社会主义建设中的实际问题的。
    最近期间，科学创作的讨论会有了广泛的发展，无论出版界和苏维埃大学，研究院学者所进行的讨论会的经验，都说明了这种讨论会是发扬批评和自我批评，和进行知识分子政治教育的最有效的形式。这些讨论会是我们直接改进科学工作的最强大的助手。
    我们有些党的组织正确地了解了科学讨论会的意义之后，已能够广泛地利用这种形式来进行知识分子的思想教育工作和动员科学工作者去解决社会主义建设中的重要问题，有时他们还表现了组织这种讨论会主动性。列宁格勒大学经济系的党委就主动地在九月份举行了关于鲁金非里德教授所著“美国工业和战争”一书的讨论会，大家都知道，这本书在全国性报纸“文化与生活”上曾受到了严重的批评，鲁金非里德教授这本书的基本缺点就在于他为美国资本主义工业作辩护。作者用一种特殊的客观主义的立场来叙述和分析材料之后，就轻易地相信和使用了资产阶级的材料，作着美国人的尾巴，给苏联读者“贡献”了在思想上有毒害的书。
    讨论会上全部发言都对鲁金非里德教授作了严重尖锐的批评，在讨论会终了时鲁金非里德教授承认了他自己这本书的客观主义的立场，认为会场上的许多发言所提的批评意见都是无条件的正确的。虽然鲁金非里德教授在若干问题上作了保留，其借口是外交条件的限制妨碍了他公开表示对美国垄断者的态度。然而讨论会总算是已经达到了自己的目的。讨论会已成为一切与会同志思想教育的特种形式的学校。
    这里我们还举另外一个例子，不久前进行了关于“国家与法律历史教程”课本第四部的讨论会，这本书是由全苏法学研究院工作者古列维赤、屠尔金涅夫、查龙等教授首次集体创作的。讨论会上对这本书提出了不少的尖锐、重要的批评的意见，认为它对帝国主义阶段的总的特征缺乏分析，指出它对各帝国主义国家间相互矛盾没有进行揭露，认为它在叙述资本主义国家的社会发展规律时没有做应有的批判的分析，虽然这一课本在基本上是被讨论会批准了，但毫无疑问，讨论会是能够帮助作者进行很多必要的改正的（这些改正是经过作者本人同意的），讨论会在另方面的益处是在讨论会上提出了很多有关于国家和法律历史科学本身的不成熟的但却是重要的问题。
    同样，最近在科学、技术、文化部门所举行的一些其他的讨论会也充分肯定的说明了这种创造性的批评和自我批评发展的形式是怎样重要和生动的工作。然而，可惜得很，现在还不是一切科学部门都把这种创造性的讨论会当作基本的工作方法之一。许多党的组织对这项工作还没有经常表现自己的必要的主动性。为什么呢？这是因为他们没有看到组织这种认真的实际的，内容丰富的讨论会的必要性，常常表现出某些顾虑，认为“讨论会什么也不能得到”，表示害怕批评和自我批评。科学讨论会的方法应成为一切科学部门，一切高级专门学校的生活规律，党的组织必须要经常注意到这种讨论会。把它看成是党在知识分子中的政治工作。
    当然，党的组织要促进科学讨论会的发展，必须要注意使批评成为原则性的，健全的，不要使批评走极端和过火，极力抹杀和掩饰缺点错误，怕得罪任何一个学者，怕把自己和学者的关系弄坏。这是不对的。对于属于自己所不满意的科学派系的学者进行笼统的不适当的诽谤和攻击，这也是不对的。这种态度任何时候也不能给我们的事业带来益处。这种态度不仅仅不能帮助我们发展科学，而且是科学发展中的严重障碍。然而，我们的许多党的组织往往不能充分说明这个看起来似乎是极普通的真理，用能发展科学真理而不是只注意“鸡毛蒜皮”的批评精神，用布尔什维克的原则性的批评精神来教育科学工作干部还做得非常不够。党的组织必须要为使科学讨论会能在高度原则的水准下进行而斗争。
    更好地组织科学讨论会，正确地领导科学讨论会，这对于发扬知识分子干部的积极性，对于培养科学工作的集体工作作风具有很大的意义，现在，科学本身的发展已进入到这样的水准，就是许多科学问题已不是个别学者所能单独解决的了，很多科学问题的解决要求一切科学团体的总动员，有时候甚至必须几个科学研究院全部科学力量的总配合。这一点在新技术的科学研究上，尤其表现得清楚。然而，我们的有些科学研究院的工作，还被一种小资产阶级的个人主义思想主宰着，我们的某些学者还想继续把自己局限和封锁在狭窄的圈子里——他们只研究自己个人觉得有兴趣的科学问题，对于当前最重要的，最实际的集体研究中的科学问题漠不关心。我们应广泛地讨论许多工作，应把偷偷摸摸关在屋子里进行的工作拿到集体的讨论会上去——这是同那些使人忍无可忍的科学、技术和文化工作中的“家长制度”进行斗争的最好的办法。
    科学讨论会广泛地提高了科学工作人员的政治思想水准，使他们在掌握马列主义理论方面，在精通辩证唯物主义方法和统一正确的科学创作方法进行有系统的工作。科学讨论会能帮助我们清除某些知识分子代表意识中的思想残余，能从品质上帮助他们把自己改造成新的苏维埃的人，能使他们受到伟大的高尚的苏维埃爱国主义的教育。
    科学讨论会的伟大作用就是教育我们知识分子有高度的党性。我们的某些学者已流为极庸俗的客观主义者了，忘记了科学文化及一切战线上的阶级性和党性，在这先进力量和反动力量尖锐斗争的现阶段，忘记我们的特点，这是为害极大的，是令人不能容忍的。目前，资本主义的科学和文化一样是为帝国主义势力服务的，而在我国则在发展着真正的，先进的，人民的社会主义文化，发展着新的社会主义的科学。这种科学是为人民利益服务的，是能够帮助人民进一步发展生产力，进一步改善劳动条件和生活条件的，这种科学正在把物质上和精神上的辉煌成绩，贡献给苏联人民，使他们日趋丰富。因此在我们国家里，科学是有着另一种与帝国主义国家原则上不同的情形，在这种不同的情形面前，摆着根本不同的任务。帝国主义在分割着科学，使科学日趋堕落腐败，把整个世纪的科学变成反动阶级力量的工具。这种资本主义世界的科学与那和人民结为一体的，成为人民手中新的共产主义社会建设的巨大力量的先进苏维埃科学，是根本不同的，是敌对的。
    在我们的国家里，有些个别的科学家，忘记了科学的阶级性和党性，这样他们就坠入了严重的错误的深渊里去。忘记了社会科学的阶级原则，譬如说忘记了社会的历史就是阶级斗争的历史这一点，就使我们某些哥萨克斯丹尼、乌克兰、莫尔达维的历史家们在解说历史问题时，犯了资产阶级民族主义的错误。热布拉克教授的事件也正是科学上不关心政治的惨痛例子。热布拉克教授忘记苏联公民的最起码的义务：他不仅仅不给著名法西斯反动派理论家美人萨克斯所著的生物学以强烈的反击，而且他还和他们凑在一起发展什么世界生物学，在法西斯面前卑躬屈膝，并诽谤和非议优秀的苏维埃学者，因此，他就犯了反对爱国主义的罪行，遭到苏维埃社会科学界的义正辞严的驳斥。
    在我们这里有些学者们还保持着一种对资本主义观点不进行批评的态度。就拿哥列斯涅夫教授所著“社会主义农业组织”这本书来说吧，这本书特别令人不能容忍的是他对于外国农业先进技术的叙述。作者在这本书里，毫无限制毫无分寸地赞颂美国和德国的技术，但他却没有说明先进的技术与资本主义社会制度的具体矛盾，没有说明俄国的优秀的学者和技师们在社会主义农业机械化的工作方面，正在大步的前进着。最后作者更没有说明一个最重要的原理，就是，真正的，坚不可摧的先进农业技术只有在社会主义的条件下才有可能产生。更没有说明苏联在农业机械化的成就是空前未有的。作者本人的这种不正确的反真理的态度，就使他形成这样错误的观念，认为只有美国和德国才能有良好的农业机器制造业，而我国的农机制造业，是应当盲目的模仿和依附美国德国的。虽然，全世界都知道苏维埃祖国生产的许多的机器是世界上最优秀的机器。
    和上述的讨论会一样，其他许多类似工作的广泛批评性的讨论会，在使知识分子干部懂得对资本主义科学和技术的应有的党的态度方面，在发扬他们用新的，勇敢的创造精神去解决技术问题方面都具有很大的教育意义。向墨守成规，因循不进的态度进行斗争的精神，敢于创造新的生产方法，和新机器，新器械的精神，都是我国科学技术界知识分子真正爱国主义精神的实际表现。党的组织经过科学讨论会能同我们某些工程师、技术知识分子意识中的旧思想残余进行决定性的斗争，特别是能帮助他们从那些认为只有美国垄断者及其他技术发达的资本主义国家才能有最好的机器制造业等的错误观点中解放出来。告诉他们，是曾经有这样的时候，那时苏维埃国家必须从外国专家那里取得技术上的帮助，然而这样的时候早已过去了，我们的知识分子已取得了这样的经验，就是一切外国专家的本事，我们都能学到。
    苏维埃政权建设以来，特别是斯大林五年计划执行的这个时期，我们的祖国在技术上已大步的前进了。如果说我们过去曾是资本主义国家技术方面的附庸的话，那么，现在已不是而且根本不能这样说了。我们已创造了充分的条件，使得我国在短期间内，在一切科学和技术的成就方面不仅能赶上，而且超过一切其他国家。在使用社会主义建设，一切技术成就时，我们应不要忘记勇敢的开辟科学和技术的新道路的问题，应探索出解决国民经济中许多科学技术问题的合理方法，并应经常记住斯大林同志的话：“事情常是这样的，新的科学和技术道路的开辟者往往不是科学界的知名之士而是那些全无名望的科学工作者，是普通的人普通的实践和事业的创造者们”党的组织应当经过科学讨论来培养干部，使他们注意研究每天的经验，总结和发展这些经验，并把经验体现到实际生活中去。使他们懂得许多新起者都能够成为工业上和农业上的先进的斯达汉诺夫者，斯大林奖金的公告上说，必须要经常不断涌现善于创造推进科学事业的新技术方法和新劳动办法的斯达汉诺夫运动者。
    我们一再坚信，科学讨论会是能够成为有原则性地广泛和深入地讨论各种科学工作优、缺点的最有效的办法。我们应着重地指出及时和正确的组织科学讨论会，能够帮助我们预防错误书籍及论述的出版，把我们的出版物和广大读者从必不可免的错误中解脱出来（因为书一出版就成了“既成事实”。只有科学讨论会的经常举行，才能预防这种“既成事实”。）
    党的组织在使用科学讨论会的方法时，在发扬必要的独立的主动性时，应同某些科学工作者的庸俗的无党性的行为进行斗争，应当培养高尚的爱国主义的精神，党的组织应当逐渐提高知识分子热爱我国人民的感情，应使他们更努力地把新的精神上物质上的宝贵的成就贡献给我国人民，应使他们看到我国人民的发展和幸福。科学讨论会的实际意义是不可争辩的，科学讨论会的召开，使得很多科学干部迫切的要求发扬批评和自我批评。科学讨论会的方法应成为党的组织对科学干部进行思想教育的最重要的环节；应成为动员数千百万苏维埃科学工作者去解决社会主义建设实际问题的最重要的环节；应成为解决工业建设，集体农业建设，苏维埃社会主义文化建设的重要任务的最重要的环节。
