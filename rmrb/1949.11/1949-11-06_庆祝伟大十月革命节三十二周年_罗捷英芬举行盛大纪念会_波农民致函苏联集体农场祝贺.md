Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 5th: TASS, London: Glasgow, the industrial and commercial center of Scotland, held a grand rally on November 1st to celebrate the 32nd anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution. The masses present warmly welcomed members of the Soviet Union's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries delegation and the Soviet miners' delegation currently in Scotland. Campbell, President of the Scotland-Soviet Friendship Association, pointed out the role played by the Soviet Union in the struggle to defend peace in his opening remarks. He said: Soviet foreign policy reflects the wishes of millions of people who desire peace. Paulson, General Secretary of the Scottish Miners' Union, spoke of his recent impressions of his visit to the Soviet Union, citing eloquent facts from the lives of Soviet miners to illustrate the superiority of the Soviet socialist system over the capitalist system. He said, "The Soviet people are striving to further improve their living and working conditions. It is for this reason, and not because they are weak or afraid of threats, that they are tenaciously fighting for peace. They are fighting for peace because they are strong and supported by the people of other countries." Forrest, a member of the association, expressed anger at the anti-Soviet movement of the British reactionaries.
