　　Receiving Good News
　　Zhang Zhimin
　　I

　　The sun rises two poles high,
　　Illuminating the elm treetops in front of the door red,
　　Magpies spread their wings with a "boop boop la" sound,
　　Chirping, "喳喳, 喳喳" without stopping.

　　Sister Wang is cooking breakfast,
　　The firewood in the stove crackles.
　　She picks up a grass stalk and draws on the stove platform,
　　Some lines are long, some are short,
　　She counted the long and short ones once,
　　Exactly fifty lines,
　　The last time her husband wrote was on the third day of the seventh month,
　　It's been exactly fifty days now,
　　He used to write every month,
　　Why hasn't a letter been forwarded home this month?

　　The magpies on the elm tree chirp, "喳喳,"
　　Sister Wang's heart beats "thump thump,"
　　Guessing left and right,
　　Thousands of thoughts accumulate in her heart,
　　Could it be that their team has moved far away?
　　Could it be he doesn't have time because of fighting?
　　Could it be he's sick or ailing?
　　Could it be the postman misdelivered the letter?
　　Could it be he blames me for replying late last time?
　　Blames me for treating him too coldly?
　　Thinking it over and over,
　　A burst of anxiety, a burst of resentment.

　　Thinking about the present, remembering the past,
　　Remembering the day he went south,
　　So many red flags, so many cannons,
　　Thousands of men and horses like a wave of smoke,
　　The team passed in front of this village,
　　He came into the house and looked in a mirror,
　　Drank a mouthful of water and held the baby,
　　Instructed a few heartfelt words,
　　He said: "The days of victory are in sight,

　　Crossing the river is like chasing a wolf downhill,
　　Don't worry about anything,
　　I'll come to see you after the revolution is victorious,
　　You must do the work in the fields,
　　Raise the baby to be good and happy,
　　I'll write back to you every month,
　　The government will take care of the family's difficulties,
　　As long as we carry the revolution to the end,
　　Our good days as husband and wife are ahead."
　　Before he finished speaking,
　　The team had moved far away,
　　He picked up his backpack and hurried,
　t have time to look back,
　　Sister Wang stood at the door, looking expectantly,
　　He walked so fast!
　　Like "Erlang carrying a mountain to chase the sun."

　　Sister Wang was thinking with her head down,
　　One thing after another crowding her heart,
　　When she thinks of the happy things, she smiles in her heart,
　　When she thinks he hasn't written, she's really upset,
　　Her body is in a daze, her heart is blank,
　　Her two eyes stare at the ashes in the stove.

　　II

　　The magpies still chirp non-stop,
　　Someone keeps knocking on Sister Wang's door,
　　She listens carefully and hears someone calling,
　　The voice sounds like Village Chief Li Wenyuan,
　　She goes out to open the door, thinking in her heart,
　　So many thoughts accumulate in her heart,
　　Could it be I'm invited to a meeting?
　　Could it be he's here to urge me to make military shoes?
　　Could it be someone has been assigned to help with the farming?
　　Could it be a letter from his father?

　　Sister Wang reaches out and opens the door,
　　Village Chief Li steps into the yard,
　　Before even entering the house, he says "Good news!"
　　Sister Wang can't figure out where the good news comes from?
　　Village Chief Li is so happy he doesn't know what to say,
　　He takes out a red card from his pocket,
　　"Sister, come and see!
　　The child's father mailed a red announcement of merit."

　　Red announcement of merit, bright red,
　　Six inches long and eight inches wide,
　　Black characters written on the glossy red paper,
　　The "August 1st" red flag printed on top.
　　Village Chief Li points and reads the announcement,
　　"Special Class Hero, Wang Yongnian."
　　Gold seals stamped on it,
　　The names of the commander and political commissar listed below,
　　Sister Wang takes the announcement with trembling hands,
　　The red announcement makes her face hot,
　　She can't read anything except up and down,
　　She's very familiar with the three words "Wang Yongnian,"
　　Village Chief Li gives a thumbs up and praises,
　　"Sister, you are truly glorious!"
　　Sister Wang stares intently at the announcement of merit,
　　Her face full of shyness,
　　Her heart full of joy.

　　III

　　The red sun shines with ten thousand golden rays,
　　Illuminating Sister Wang's big north room,
　　The snow-white walls are bright,
　　The bright red announcement of merit is pasted in the center,
　　She wipes the table clean and sweeps the floor,
　　She dresses the baby in new flowered clothes,
　　The dressing mirror is placed on the table,
　　She combs and arranges her hair carefully,
　　Her slender hair is as black as ink,
　　A blue ribbon is tied into a butterfly,
　　Her indigo-colored cloth jacket is ironed smooth,
　　White socks and black shoes are clearly distinct,
　　Today, the village is coming to congratulate her,
　　Sister Wang's hands haven't stopped since morning.

　　After getting everything ready, she picks up the baby,
　　The two-year-old baby is just learning to talk,
　　She holds the baby in front of the announcement,
　　"Son! Dear, look,
　　Your father has performed meritorious service on the front line,
　　This is your father's citation,
　　Mom watches you grow up quickly,
　　When you grow up, you'll also be a hero."

　　The magpies on the elm tree chirp "喳喳" again,
　　The gongs and drums on the street keep beating.
　　Village Chief Li comes to deliver the message,
　　"Sister, get ready,
　　The congratulatory party is coming soon!"

　　She picks up the baby and goes out to meet them,
　　The sky is full of joy, the street is full of people,
　　Red and green flags flutter in the sky,
　　Even the eighty-year-old grandmothers come out to watch.
　　The streets used to seem so wide,
　　Today, the rooftops and walls are full of people,
　　District Chief Zhao leads the team,
　　The children's band plays music in the back,
　　Eight people carry a vermilion plaque,
　　More imposing than an eight-person sedan,
　　You can see the head but not the tail,
　　People from ten villages and five miles around have come to attend,
　　Everyone says the incense festival at the Three-Month Temple is like a small Beijing,
　　Today, there are even more people than at the incense festival.
　　The congratulatory party arrives at the door,
　　Sister Wang's heart beats fast, the baby stares,
　　District Chief Zhao first says "Congratulations,"
　　Relatives and friends all rush forward,
　　"Sister-in-law, congratulations, congratulations!"
　　"Sister, glory, glory!"
　　"Aunt, honorable, honorable!"
　　"Younger sister, good fortune, good fortune!"
　　The maternal grandmother holds the baby and praises:
　　"When you grow up, learn from your father!"
　　The girls and daughters-in-law surround Sister Wang tightly,
　　Looking at her carefully from head to toe,
　　Looking at her clothes, looking at her face,
　　Sister Wang is prettier than ever,
　　Looking at her, she's full of glory,
　　Every hair is liked!
　　The Women's Federation puts a flower of glory on her,
　　Sister Wang is both shy and happy, and can't speak.

　　Four high tables are placed together,
　　The gold-lettered red plaque is placed in the center,
　　As soon as Sister Wang steps onto the stage,
　　It's as if everyone has a line tied to her eyes.
　　District Chief Zhao begins to speak,
　　He stands on a bench,
　　He says: "This meeting reminds me of a year ago,
　　Sister Wang sent her husband to join the army,
　　She said clearly to her husband:
　　"Being a soldier means being a hero!"
　　Wang Yongnian also told her two sentences:
　　"Do a good job in production and raise the child well!"
　　Wang Yongnian is now a hero,
　　Sister Wang is the strongest in production and raising the child,
　　The baby is raised fair and chubby,
　　And she's also the model textile group leader in the village,
　t these revolutionary couples honorable?
　　That glory, I can't finish saying it in these few words."

　　Welcome Sister Wang to speak,
　　Applause roars like a wave,
　　Short people look on tiptoe,
　　Hard-of-hearing people lean forward,
　　Children crawl under adults' legs,
　　Surrounding Sister Wang tightly,
　　Before she speaks, her face turns red,
　　Like a sunny apple, bright and shining,
　　She pats her jacket and touches her hair,
　　Showing some shyness,
　　She says: "Wang Yongnian performed meritorious service on the front line,
　　This is the glory of our villagers and my son and me,
　　I will do a better job in production and take care of the home,
　　So that he can make even more and greater contributions."

　　The yangko dance is joyful, the gongs and drums beat fiercely,
　　The courtyard is packed tightly,
　　Every face is full of smiles,
　　Every pair of eyes is looking at her,
　　An eight-foot gold plaque hangs on the door,
　　"Glory to the Military Family" is written on it.
　　Two red ribbons flutter in the wind,
　　The magpies on the elm tree chirp "喳喳" again.
　　November 15th, 1949, in Beijing.

　　接喜报
    张志民
　　一
　
    日头出来两竿子高，
    照红了门前的榆树梢，
    喜雀展翅“卟卟啦”的响，
    “喳喳，喳喳”不住声的叫。
　
    王大姐正把早饭烧，
    灶塘里的柴火“噼叭”的爆。
    她拾起根草棍在锅台上画，
    有长道儿，也有短道道，
    长长短短数了一遍，
    不多不少五十条，
    上一次丈夫来信是七月初三，
    到如今整整是五十天，
    按往常月月都来信，
    为什么这个月没信家转？
　
    榆树上的喜雀“喳喳”的叫，
    王大姐的心里“嘣嘣”的跳，
    左也猜呀右也想，
    千头万绪积心上，
    莫不是他们队伍开的远？
    莫不是他打仗没时间？
    莫不是他生灾闹了病？
    莫不是邮差把信错传？
    莫不是嫌我上次回信晚？
    怪我待他太冷淡？
    左盘算来右盘算，
    一阵子急来一阵子怨。
　
    想如今呀思从前，
    想起他南下的那一天，
    多少杆子红旗多少门炮，
    千人万马一股浪烟，
    队伍就打这庄前过，
    他进到家来照了一面，
    喝了口水抱了抱娃，
    嘱咐了几句知心的话，
    他说：“胜利的日子有了望，
　
    过江是虎赶下坡狼，
    什么都不要你惦记，
    革命胜利后来看你，
    田地里的活儿你要干，
    娃娃要养得乖又欢，
    我月月给你打回信，
    家里的困难政府里管，
    只要把革命干到底，
    咱夫妻的好日月在后边。”
    他话没说完，
    队伍就开出了大老远，
    他背起背包急忙赶，
    没容得回头看一眼，
    王大姐站门前眼巴巴的望，
    他走的那个快呀！
    赛过那“二郎爷担山赶太阳”。
　
    王大姐正在闷着头儿想，
    一宗宗一件件挤在心上，
    想到那个喜处心里头笑，
    想起他还不来信实在心乱，
    身发呆，心发楞
    两只眼死盯着皂火坑。
　
　　二
　
    喜雀还是不住声的叫，
    王大姐的大门不住点的敲，
    他侧耳一听有人叫喊，
    听嗓音象村长李文元，
    她走出去开门心里头想，
    多少个念头积心上，
    赶是请我去开会？
    赶是来把军鞋催？
    赶是拨来了代耕的人？
    赶是他爹来了信？
　
    王大姐伸手把门开，
    李村长迈腿就进院来，
    没容得进屋就道了个“喜”！
    王大姐解不开喜从何来？
    李村长喜的不知怎么说，
    从怀里掏出张红帖帖，
    “大妹子呀，你来瞧！
    孩子他爹邮来了红喜报。”
　
    红喜报，红艳艳，
    六寸长呀八寸宽，
    格登登的红纸上写着黑字，
    “八一”红旗印上边。
    李村长手指着把喜报念，
    “特等功臣王永年。”
    一颗颗金印在上面盖，
    司令员政委的名字在下面排，
    王大姐两手颤颤把喜报接，
    红喜报照得她脸发热，
    上上下下她都不会念，
    “王永年”三个字她顶熟惯，
    李村长伸着大姆指头夸，
    “大妹子呀你真光荣呀！”
    王大姐目不转神把喜报看
    满脸的羞气，
    满心的喜欢。
　
　　三
　
    红日头射出万道金光，
    照到那王大姐的大北房，
    雪白的粉墙满屋子亮，
    鲜红的喜报贴当央，
    擦净了桌子扫净了地，
    给娃娃换上了新花衣，
    梳妆的镜子摆桌上，
    左梳右栊细打量，
    细长的头发墨一样黑，
    蓝带带结成个蝴蝶飞，
    青市布褂子熨的平上平，
    白袜子黑鞋好分明，
    今儿个村里要来贺喜，
    王大姐从早手没停。
　
    收拾停当抱过了娃，
    两周岁的娃娃刚学说话，
    把娃娃抱在喜报前，
    “儿呀！姣呀，你看看，
    你爹在前线上立了功，
    这是你爹的报功单，
    妈妈看着你快快长，
    长大了也把英雄当。”
　
    榆树上的喜雀又“喳喳”的叫，
    大街上的锣鼓不住点的敲。
    李村长头前来报信，
    “大妹子呀你准备好，
    贺喜的马上就来了！”
　
    她抱起娃娃迎出了门，
    满天的喜气满街的人，
    红绿彩旗飘满了天
    八十岁的老婆也出来看。
    往日里的街道显着那么宽，
    今儿个房顶墙头人站满，
    赵区长头前带着队，
    子弟班的音乐后面吹，
    八个人抬着朱红匾
    比那八抬大轿还威严，
    看到了头可望不到尾，
    十乡五里都来开会，
    人人说三月三香火庙上象小北京，
    今儿个人比香火庙还多几成。
    贺喜的人们到了门前，
    王大姐心里跳，娃娃看直了眼，
    赵区长头前先道“喜”，
    亲戚朋友们都赶上了前，
    “大嫂子，恭喜呀恭喜！”
    “大妹子，光荣呀光荣！”
    “他婶子，体面呀体面！”
    “老妹子，福气呀福气！”
    娘家姥姥抱过娃来夸：
    “你长大了学爸爸！”
    姑娘媳妇把王大姐围了个严，
    从头到脚细细看，
    看看她的衣裳看看她的脸，
    王大姐比那天都好看，
    看着她浑身都是那个光荣劲
    每一根汗毛都喜欢！
    妇联会给她带上朵光荣花，
    王大姐又羞又喜说不出话。
　
    四张高桌并把放，
    金字红匾摆当央，
    王大姐一走上会台前，
    她象在人人眼上都拴着条线。
    赵区长开始把话讲，
    他站起来立在板凳上，
    他说：“开这个会就想起了一年前，
    王大姐送夫把军参，
    他向着丈夫说的明：
    “当兵就要当英雄！”
    王永年也告诉他两句话：
    “闹好生产养好娃！”
    王永年如今把英雄当，
    王大姐生产养娃数她强，
    娃娃养的白又胖，
    又是村里的模范纺织组长，
    这样的革命夫妻有多体面，
    那个光荣呀，我这几句话也
    说不完。”
　
    欢迎王大姐讲话，
    掌声响成了一大片，
    个儿小的跷着脚儿看，
    耳朵背的向前扒，
    小孩从着大人腿下钻，
    把王大姐围了个严上严，
    她未从说话脸先红，
    象那向阳的苹果亮里发明，
    她扑打大襟撩撩头发，
    多少有几分羞答答，
    她说：“王永年在前线立下功，
    这是咱乡亲跟我母子的光荣，
    我要更好的生产看家，
    叫他的功立的更多更大。”
　
    秧歌扭的欢呀，锣鼓敲的凶，
    四合院子挤了个不透风，
    每一张脸上都含着笑，
    第一对眼睛都向着她瞧，
    八尺的金匾挂门前，
    “军属光荣”写上边。
    两道子红丝带迎着风儿飘，
    榆树上的喜雀又“喳喳”的叫。
    四九年，十一月十五日于北京。
