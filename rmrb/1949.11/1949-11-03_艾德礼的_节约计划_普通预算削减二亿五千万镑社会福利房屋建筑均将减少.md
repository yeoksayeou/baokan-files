Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 28th -- London: To cope with the adverse effects of inflation caused by the devaluation of the pound, British Prime Minister Attlee announced a so-called "austerity plan" to the House of Commons on the 24th and broadcast it to the nation, attempting to sacrifice the interests of the working people to alleviate the increasingly serious economic crisis (it is estimated that since the devaluation of the pound, the prices of British imports have generally increased by 20%). According to Attlee's plan, the ordinary budget will be cut by £250 million this year, and defense expenditures will be cut by £30 million. In the ordinary budget, the investment budget will be cut by £140 million, government expenditures will be cut by £90 million (including £45 million for social welfare and food subsidies, etc.), and miscellaneous expenditures will be cut by £20 million. Due to the reduction of the investment budget, the ongoing housing construction plan and the plan to re-equip mines and power plants will be significantly affected. The problems of housing shortages, school shortages, hospital shortages, and outdated machinery and equipment, which have not been resolved in Britain after the war, will become more serious, and tens of thousands of workers currently engaged in this work will lose their jobs. Due to the reduction in social welfare expenses, the current free medical services will charge one shilling each time. Since the government is scheduled to abolish subsidies for food producers next spring, the prices of fish, eggs, and raisins will also rise along with the already rising prices of bread and flour. In the days before the "austerity plan" was announced, residents of London had already started a buying spree.
    The British people had strongly demanded that the Labour government cut the unprecedentedly huge "peacetime military expenditure" of £800 million per year in British history, and advocated maintaining and increasing social welfare expenditures to reduce the people's burden and increase purchasing power. However, the "austerity plan" announced by Attlee completely runs counter to the wishes of the people. Therefore, after Attlee announced his "austerity plan," it immediately aroused the anger of the British people. Even Labour Party members of Parliament expressed dissatisfaction. When the House of Commons discussed Attlee's statement on the 25th, four Labour members of Parliament proposed a motion requesting a large reduction in military expenditure, the abolition of conscription, savings in administrative expenses, and advocating that expenditures on housing construction plans and social welfare undertakings should not be reduced. The Associated Press pointed out: "These four proposers are not powerful members of the Labour Party, but their reaction is indeed a sign of dissatisfaction from all parties with the government's plan."

　　艾德礼的“节约计划”
    普通预算削减二亿五千万镑社会福利房屋建筑均将减少
    【新华社北京二十八日电】伦敦讯：为了对付英镑贬值所造成的通货膨胀的恶劣情况，英国首相艾德礼于二十四日向下院宣布，并向全国广播所谓“节约计划”，企图牺牲劳动人民的利益，来缓和日趋严重的经济危机（据估计，自英镑贬值以来，英国入口货价格已普遍上涨百分之二十）。根据艾德礼的计划，今年普通预算将削减二亿五千万镑，国防费用将削减三千万镑。在普通预算中投资预算削减一亿四千万镑，政府开支削减九千万镑（包括社会福利经费四千五百万镑与粮食补贴等），零星开支削减二千万镑。由于投资预算的削减，目前进行中的房屋建筑计划与重新装备矿山与动力厂的计划，将遭受重大影响。英国战后迄未解决的屋荒、学校荒、医院荒与机器装备陈旧过时的问题，将更趋严重，而目前从事这一工作的成万工人将告失业。由于社会福利费用的削减，目前免费的医药服务，每次将收费一先令。由于政府定于明春废除对粮食生产者的津贴费，鱼类、蛋类与葡萄干的价格，也将随着业已上涨的面包、面粉价格而上涨。在“节约计划”宣布前几天，伦敦居民已展开了抢购潮。
    英国人民曾强烈要求工党政府，削减年达八亿英镑的英国历史上空前庞大的“平时军费”，并主张维持和增加社会福利经费，以减轻人民负担，提高购买力。但艾德礼宣布的“节约计划”，完全与人民的愿望背道而驰。因此，在艾德礼宣布其“节约计划”之后，立刻引起了英国人民的愤怒。甚至工党议员也表示不满。二十五日下院讨论艾德礼声明时，四名工党议员提出了动议，要求大量削减军费，废除征兵制，节省行政开支，并主张对房屋建筑计划与社会福利事业的费用，不予削减。合众社指出：“这四个提案人并非工党的有力分子，但他们的反响，实在是各方不满意政府计划的征象。”
