　　Usage: 1. When injecting this vaccine, the subcutaneous injection method should be used.
　　2. During injection, all utensils should be strictly disinfected; syringes and needles must be boiled for ten minutes to disinfect.
　　3. The skin of the injected part (the attachment of the deltoid muscle on the outer side of the upper arm) should be first smeared with 2.5% iodine tincture. After it dries, wipe off the iodine tincture with 70% alcohol.
　　4. The hands of the traveling injector should be washed clean with soap.
　　5. The top of the vaccine bottle stopper should be disinfected with iodine tincture. When the vaccine is about to be used, the bottle must be shaken vigorously to mix the precipitated bacteria evenly. Then, use a sterilized syringe to pierce through the small diamond-shaped frame in the middle of the bottle stopper. First, inject the same amount of air as the vaccine to be drawn out into the bottle, and then draw out the required vaccine for use. Do not remove the bottle stopper and pour out the vaccine to avoid contamination.
　　6. Special attention should be paid during injection not to inject into blood vessels. When the needle is inserted under the skin, the inner cylinder of the syringe should be drawn back slightly. If no blood comes out, then injection can begin.
　　Dosage: Normally, each person only needs one injection, with a dosage of one cubic centimeter. However, if two or three injections can be given, the effect will be better. The first injection is 0.5 cubic centimeters, and the second and third injections are each one cubic centimeter. For children aged one to six, use one-third of the adult dose; for those aged seven to twelve, use one-half of the adult dose; those over thirteen years old should use the adult dose.
　　Contraindications: The person being injected must be in good health. For those who are ill, pregnant women over five months, or women during menstruation, the dosage can be divided into two or three injections within ten days. It is not advisable to drink alcohol, bathe, or engage in strenuous exercise within one or two days after injection to avoid increasing the reaction.
　　Reaction: The reaction to the injection of live vaccine is usually slightly more severe than the injection of dead vaccine. This phenomenon is a normal reaction of the body to the vaccine and will subside soon without any hindrance.
　　Storage: This product should be stored in a cool and dark place. The temperature of the storage place should be between 2 and 10 degrees Celsius. The label indicates the expiration date; expired products should not be used.
　　Special Note: Because this vaccine does not contain preservatives, special attention should be paid during storage and use to avoid accidents caused by contamination.

    ２、注射时，一切用具，均应严密消毒；注射器及针头等必须煮沸消毒十分钟。
    ３、被注射部分（上臂外侧之三角肌附着处）之皮肤，应先用百分之二点五碘酒涂擦，干后，再用百分之七十酒精将碘酒擦去。
    ４、旅行注射者之手，应以肥皂洗涤清洁。
    ５、菌苗之瓶塞顶部，应涂以碘酒消毒。菌苗临用时，必须将瓶极力摇动，使已沉淀之细菌混合均匀，再以消毒之注射器由瓶塞顶上中间菱形小框处刺入，先将所要吸出菌苗同等量之空气注入瓶内，再将所需之菌苗吸出应用。切不可将瓶塞除去，倒取菌苗，以免污染。
    ６、注射时，应特别注意，千万不要注入血管内，当针头插入皮下时，应先将注射器之内筒向后略抽，如无血液冒出，始可注射。
    用量：普通每人只须注射一次，用量一公撮，但如能注射二次或三次，其效果当更好，第一次○、五公撮，第二、三次各一公撮。儿童一岁至六岁者用成人量之三分之一；七岁至十二岁用成人量之二分之一；十三岁以上用成人量。

    反应：注射活菌菌苗的反应，通常比注射死菌菌苗稍为剧烈，此现象为身体对菌苗之一种正常反应，不久即退，并无妨碍。
