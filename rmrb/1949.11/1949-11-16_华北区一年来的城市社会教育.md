　　Urban Social Education in the North China Region Over the Past Year
  　　　　　I. Workers' Education
    (1) Development and Achievements of Workers' Education. Under the direct leadership of the Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Municipal Trade Union Council, workers in various public enterprise departments in Beijing established 70 workers' night schools, 400 study groups, and 120 study classes in half a year. Employees of various factories produced their own blackboard newspapers, wall newspapers, mimeographed newspapers, and letterpress newspapers. Employees were also able to regularly contribute to newspapers, reflecting their active production and hard work. This summer, more than 300 college and university students went deep into factories to help more than 8,000 workers establish learning organizations, which further improved workers' political, cultural, and technical skills. The Beijing Municipal Education Bureau also stipulated that workers' education should be the focus of urban social education work. District work groups, district governments, people's cultural centers, and other organizations, in conjunction with their central work, organized 191 study classes for workers in private factories and casual workers, giving 8,098 male and female workers the opportunity to study. Students from the Tianjin Hebei Provincial Institute of Technology organized study groups, with up to 1,200 workers participating in the study. After May, the People's Cultural Centers in Tianjin paid attention to workers' education according to the instructions of their superiors. The Seventh Center alone organized three classes, including Baoju from private factories, with 92 male and female workers participating in the study with great enthusiasm and doing well. In Tangshan City, the number of workers' study classes increased from 26 in March to 33 in April. Worker education in other cities such as Zhangjiakou and Baoding has also been successful. Heze also set up 16 workers' night schools, inspiring workers to specifically recognize the sacred significance of labor creating the world and labor being the most glorious through learning, understanding the policy of labor-capital mutual benefit, engaging in labor with the qualifications of masters, and greatly improving production efficiency. For example, the Heze Cigarette Factory used to produce 147 cigarettes per roll of paper, but now it can produce five more cigarettes per roll. In the past, it took ten hours of work a day to produce two rolls of paper, but now it takes eight hours to produce two and a half rolls of paper, so the capitalists also realized the benefits of workers' learning. Articles written by workers can often be seen in newspapers, and workers' programs are often broadcast on People's Radio Stations. The Tianjin Art Museum held an exhibition of workers' art works, and many of them were selected and published in the Tianjin Daily, showing the artistic talent of workers. In sports activities, workers have also become major participants, so that workers have achieved equal development in both physical and mental exercise. This is not only the workers educating themselves, but also educating the broad masses of society.
    (2) Shortcomings and Suggestions for Improvement in Workers' Education. After the North China People's Government promulgated the "North China Region Cultural Education Construction Plan for 1949," because we were relatively unfamiliar with urban social education work and lacked experience, we failed to provide timely and specific instructions to lower levels, resulting in a deviation in Zhangjiakou, Tangshan, and other places in the early days of liberation where insufficient attention was paid to workers' education. In some cases, the education department and the trade union council did not work closely together, and the teachers' teaching skills were not proficient, and they could not be well connected with reality, which reduced the workers' learning effect. Some were inappropriately grouped and class schedules were too long, failing to take into account the workers' fatigue, which affected their learning mood. In response to these experiences and shortcomings, the following improvements must be made in the future:
    (1) Industrial worker education in state-owned mines and factories is most convenient when workers' lives are relatively concentrated, workers' organizations are relatively sound, and the leadership of the mines and factories provide more help to workers' learning, and the trade union council completely leads the learning. However, organizing workers in private factories or casual workers to study must be done by the trade union council and the political education department, people's cultural centers, and other organizations to establish a unified leadership organization, organize and mobilize through the trade union council, and the education department will solve the problems of school location and teachers. Only with the organic cooperation of all parties can workers' education be carried out smoothly.
    (2) To organize workers to study, it is necessary to go deep into factories, understand the situation, and understand the lives of workers. The style should be quick and enthusiastic, do what you say, do not put on airs, do not use clichés, and first get along with the workers emotionally. If you find activists and take the lead, learning can be done well.
    (3) The content and organization of workers' learning should meet the learning requirements of the masses, take care of the needs of all parties, and the division of classes and groups should be diversified, and should not be forced to be uniform.
    (4) Teachers should be fixed, and teaching time should take into account the workers' fatigue. Generally, workers need mental adjustment after eight to ten hours of intense work every day. It is necessary to sing songs before and after class. The time for regular classes should not exceed one and a half hours per night. If the time is too long, the learning efficiency will be reduced.
    (5) The teaching materials should be systematic, and political and cultural lessons should be separated. Whether it is cultural learning or political learning, teaching should be carried out step by step according to the degree of acceptance, so that workers will feel interested in learning. Appropriate solutions to teaching materials are also important conditions for carrying out workers' education and persisting in workers' learning.
    (6) In order to strengthen the leadership of workers' education. Social education areas should be designated. When the number of shifts in each social education area reaches a considerable number, a school department can be set up separately if necessary to unify the cultural learning of workers and citizens in the area. This is an effective way for workers' learning to become regularized and should be adopted and promoted.
    　　　　II. General Citizen Education
    (1) Activities and Achievements of People's Cultural Centers. The People's Cultural Center is a good organizational form for carrying out social education for the broad masses of citizens in cities. Its scope of work is very wide, and the broad masses outside the school should be regarded as the object of the work of the cultural center. Current affairs and policy education, production and health education, and cultural education for workers and citizens are all the contents of the work of the cultural center. Because the People's Cultural Center is needed by the people and valued by the leaders, it has developed rapidly in the past year. Before the establishment of the North China People's Government, there were only 48 such centers in the region; in one year, it has developed to 155. Tianjin alone has 11, with 3 branches. Beijing has also increased from two to six. The activities of the People's Cultural Centers mainly include the following:
    (1) Conducting current affairs and political propaganda. The Shijiazhuang People's Cultural Center installed a wired oral broadcasting station, which connected 24 public and private loudspeakers. At that time, broadcasts could be heard everywhere on the prosperous streets of Qiaoxi. During the spring epidemic prevention propaganda, the People's Cultural Centers in Tianjin used blackboard newspapers, big-character posters, microphones, and street propaganda to educate the masses, and the masses benefited a lot. The First Center alone, in cooperation with the health authorities, vaccinated 919 people and vaccinated 381 people. The Tangshan Cultural Center used modern propaganda tools such as slides and movies to conduct mass education; in one month, slides were shown 25 times, and the film team showed movies in factories 30 times in three months. The Dingxian Cultural Center sang drums before conducting propaganda in the market fairs. After more people gathered, another comrade explained current affairs. At the same time, we should increase the work of uniting and transforming old artists, so that the masses can often hear new drum lyrics sung by quyi workers. The Boz鎮 Cultural Center organized the city's cultural and educational workers to use blackboard newspapers and street propaganda to explain the received victory news to the people who went to the market in a timely manner. One person told ten, and ten told a hundred. In one day, it spread to villages thirty to forty miles away. All these lively and vivid forms of propaganda are welcomed by the masses.
    (2) Holding various exhibitions. Using photos, comic strips, physical charts, organize exhibitions on the achievements of the People's Liberation Army, mass movements, the construction of the liberated areas, health and epidemic prevention, and production achievements, with simple written explanations, and special personnel to make oral explanations, even illiterate women and children can deeply appreciate the meaning of the exhibition. Tianjin, Beijing, Zhangjiakou, Baoding, Tangshan and other places have been held continuously. Shijiazhuang expanded the exhibition work of the Cultural Center from the museum to the streets, factories, and troops, which was very popular. On New Year's Day this year, more than 13,000 people went to visit.
    (3) Establishing newspaper and magazine reading work. Newspaper and magazine reading is necessary for cities with concentrated population (and more intellectuals). It is one of the effective ways to eliminate the enemy's false propaganda and implement urban policies. In May, an average of 100 people came to the Tianjin Sixth Cultural Center to read books every day. In June, it reached 400 people a day, which shows the public's interest in reading new books and newspapers. Tangshan organized mobile book vehicles to send books and newspapers to busy people. Shijiazhuang established voluntary book lending offices and placed popular books and newspapers in parks and teahouses for people to read. The above methods are good ways to increase the public's opportunities to read books and newspapers.
    (4) Holding citizen cultural and technical learning. In addition to paying attention to workers' education, the cultural centers also pay attention to the cultural learning of the general public. In the first half of the year, Zhangjiakou established 40 folk schools with 2,627 male and female students. The Tianjin Cultural Center has women's literacy classes, youth cultural tutoring classes, typing classes, telegraphy classes, and sewing classes. Including the workers' classes, there are 64 classes with 2,128 students. The Shijiazhuang Vocational Tutoring School has a dedicated school building, full-time teachers, and fixed funding. Students have a relatively complete system for enrollment, class assignment, promotion, and graduation, making it a typical example of the regularization of citizen cultural learning.
    (5) Establishing a social service department. Cultural centers in Zhangjiakou, Shijiazhuang, and other places have this kind of setting. Write letters for the masses, answer questions, introduce occupations, etc. And use seminars, home visits, making friends and other methods to conduct various social surveys, understand the ideological trends of the masses and the implementation of policies in each period, and reflect them to the leadership organs in a timely manner as an important reference for governance, making the cultural center a bridge between the government and the people.
    (2) Shortcomings and Suggestions for Improvement in Work. Because the People's Cultural Center is different from the old folk education center, all work must be created anew. With the existing experience, it is not possible to stipulate a complete set of methods for various places to follow, and it is inevitable that shortcomings will occur in the work. For example, the retained personnel of the old folk education center have not completely overcome their bureaucratic style and are accustomed to sitting in the museum and are not accustomed to actively approaching the broad masses of people, which has limited the development of work. In the newly built areas, some leaders did not solve the problems in the museum in a timely manner, which affected the work mood of the cadres. For example, in some areas of the Central Hebei District, there have been situations where they relied on donations to maintain the museum's operations, and cadres were not able to receive winter clothes even when it was cold. In the previous stage, the Fenyang Cultural Center fell into a small circle of uniting intellectuals and ignored the propaganda and education of the broad masses. At the beginning of its establishment, the Yuci Cultural Center bought a large number of theoretical books, but bought very few simple popular readings and current affairs policy propaganda booklets. Although some of these shortcomings in the work have been overcome and some are being overcome, attention should be paid to them in the future.
    (1) The People's Cultural Center is not only a social education work organization, but more importantly, a social education organization organization. It must become the core of urban social education activities. It must be good at organizing the forces of all parties to jointly carry out social education work. The People's Cultural Center is a mass worker on the cultural front. It must organize the forces that should be organized and can be organized to extend the work from the museum to the outside, and attract people outside the museum to the museum. Only in this way can it become a veritable People's Cultural Center.
    (2) Cadre allocation should be appropriate. In addition to possessing the conditions of general cadres, cadres of the People's Cultural Center must pay special attention to two points: first, the style is lively and simple, and they are good at contacting the masses; second, they can endure hardship and are willing to do it themselves. Leaders at all levels should pay attention to this aspect when allocating cadres. At the same time, it is also a problem that the current cadres of the Cultural Center should pay attention to improving themselves.
    (3) The organizational division of labor of the People's Cultural Center can be divided into: Propaganda Section (including broadcasting, lectures, makeup propaganda, movies, slides, seminars, exhibitions, etc.), Teaching Section (including workers, citizens, culture, technical tutoring education, etc.), Newspaper and Magazine Reading Section (including newspaper and magazine borrowing inside and outside the museum and newspaper and magazine introduction, etc.), and Social Service Section (including inquiries, writing on behalf of others, job introduction, social surveys, etc.). Sports activities can be incorporated into the Social Service Section (a separate section can also be set up if necessary); other activities such as uniting and transforming old artists, leading and organizing drama troupes, etc. require the joint cooperation of the Propaganda Section and the Social Service Section. The establishment of institutions is based on the needs of the complexity of the work and is based on the principle of streamlining and concentration. Various places cannot force uniformity. The division of four sections is only for reference.

### 华北区一年来的城市社会教育

　　华北区一年来的城市社会教育
  　　　　　一、工人教育
    （一）工人教育的开展及成绩。北京市各公营企业部门的工人，在市职工会筹委会直接领导下，经半年的时间，成立起七十处工人夜校，四百个学习组，一百二十个学习班。各工厂职工出了自己的黑板报、墙报、油印小报和铅印小报。职工们并能经常向各报纸投稿，反映积极生产、努力学习的情况。今年暑假三百多个大中学生，深入工厂，帮助八千多工人建立起学习组织，使工人政治、文化、技术都提高一步。北京市教育局也规定工人教育为城市社教工作重点，各区工作组、区政府、人民文化馆等结合着中心工作，把私立工厂工人和散工，组织起一百九十一个学习班，男女工人八○九八人得到了学习的机会。天津河北省立工学院的同学组织起工学读书会，工人参加学习的曾达到一千二百名。五月份以后，天津市各人民文化馆根据上级指示，注意了工人教育，只第七馆，就组织起私营工厂宝聚等三个班，男女工人九十二人参加学习，情绪很高，办的也都好。唐山市工人学习班，三月份二十六班，四月份增至三十三班。其他如张家口、保定等市工人教育都有成绩。菏泽也搞起工人夜校十六处，启发工人从学习中具体认识到劳动创造世界、劳动最光荣的神圣意义，懂得了劳资两利政策，以主人公的资格，从事劳动，生产效率大为提高。例如菏泽烟厂过去一盘纸出烟一四七条，现在每盘纸能多出五条烟。过去一天做工十小时，出两盘纸的活，现在八小时能出两盘半纸的活，因此资方也体会到工人学习的好处。报纸上经常可以看到工人所写的稿件，各人民广播电台，经常播送工人的节目，天津艺术馆举行了工人美术作品展览会，并有多幅选入天津日报影印发表，表现出工人的艺术天才。在体育活动上，工人也成为主要参加者，使工人在身心锻炼上，都得到同等的发展。这不只是工人自己教育了自己，同时也教育了社会上的广大群众。
    （二）工人教育中存在着的缺点和改进意见。华北人民政府公布了“一九四九年华北区文化教育建设计划”之后，由于我们对城市社教工作比较生疏，经验不足，对下级未能及时作出具体的指示，以致发生张家口唐山等地初解放时对工人教育重视不够的偏向。有的教育部门与职工会之间工作配合不密切，教员教学技术不熟练，不能很好的联系实际，减低了工人的学习效果。有的是分组编班不适当，或上课时间过长，不体会工人的疲劳，以致影响学习情绪。针对着这些经验和缺点，今后必须作如下的改进：
    （１）公营矿山工厂的产业工人教育，因工人生活比较集中，工人组织比较健全，矿厂的领导上对工人学习帮助也比较多，完全由职工会领导学习最为方便。但组织私营工厂工人或散工学习，就必须由职工会和政权教育部门人民文化馆等，建立统一领导机构，通过职工会进行组织动员，由教育部门解决校址和教员问题，各方面有机配合，工人教育才能顺利的开展起来。
    （２）组织工人学习，要深入工厂，了解情况，懂得工人的生活。作风要爽快热情，说做就做，不摆斯文架子，不八股教条，情感上先和工人打成一片。发现积极分子，起领导带头作用，学习就能搞好。
    （３）工人学习内容与学习组织，要适应群众的学习要求，照顾到各方面的需要，分班编组要多样化，不能强求划一。
    （４）教员要固定，教学时间要顾到工人的疲劳。一般工人，每天紧张的工作八小时至十小时，很需要精神上的凋剂，上课前后唱唱歌是必要的。上正课的时间每晚两节不能超过一点半钟，时间过长，学习效率就会减低。
    （５）教材要系统化，政治课文化课要分开，无论文化学习政治学习，都要根据接受程度，按步就班的去进行教学，工人才会感到学习的兴趣。适当的解决教材，也是开展工人教育坚持工人学习的重要条件。
    （６）为加强对工人教育的领导。应划定社教区，每一社教区当班次达到相当数目时，如有必需可单独设立校部，统一领导各该区工人市民的文化学习，这是工人学习走向正规化的有效办法，应该采用推广。
    　　　　二、一般市民教育
    （一）人民文化馆的活动及其成绩。人民文化馆是开展城市广大市民社会教育很好的一种组织形式。它的工作范围，甚为广泛，学校以外的广大的群众，都应作为文化馆工作的对象。时事政策教育、生产卫生教育、工人市民文化教育，都是文化馆的工作内容。因为人民文化馆为人民所需要，为领导所重视，一年来有着讯速的发展。华北人民政府成立以前，全区只有四十八处；一年工夫，已经发展到一百五十五处。只天津市就有十一处，另有分馆三处。北京市也由两处增到六处。各人民文化馆的活动，主要有以下几项：
    （１）进行时事政治宣传。石家庄人民文化馆装置起一部有线口语广播电台，连接起公私喇叭二十四个，桥西几条繁华的大街上，届时到处能听到广播。天津市各人民文化馆，在春天防疫宣传中，利用黑板报、大字报、麦克风、街头宣传等方式，向群众进行教育，群众受益很多。只第一馆，配合卫生机关，施种牛痘九一九人，打过防疫针的三八一人。唐山文化馆利用幻灯、电影等近代化的宣传工具，进行群众教育；一个月的工夫，放映幻灯二十五次，三个月中电影队到工厂放映三十次。定县文化馆在集市庙会进行宣传之前，先演唱大鼓，等聚集人多了，再由另一同志讲解时事。同时加重对旧艺人的团结改造工作，使群众经常听到曲艺工作者演唱的新鼓词。泊镇文化馆组织本市的文教工作者利用黑板报和街头宣传，把收到的胜利消息及时讲解给赶集的群众，一传十十传百，一天的时间，就传布到三、四十里以外的村庄中去。所有这些生动活泼的宣传形式，都是群众所欢迎的。
    （２）举行各种展览会。利用照片、连环画、实物图表，组织关于解放军战绩、群众运动、解放区建设、卫生防疫及生产成绩等展览会，附以简单的文字说明，并有专人作口头讲解，就是不识字的妇女儿童，耳闻目睹也能深切体会展览的意义。天津、北京、张家口、保定、唐山等地都不断的举行。石家庄把文化馆展览工作由馆内伸张到街头、工厂、部队中去，颇受欢迎。今年元旦一天之内，前往参观的达一万三千多人。
    （３）建立书报阅览工作。书报阅览为人口集中（知识分子也较多）的城市所必需。它是肃清敌伪欺骗宣传，贯彻城市政策有效的方法之一。天津第六文化馆，五月份平均每天来馆看书的一百人，到六月份一天曾达到四百人，可见群众对新书报阅览的兴趣。唐山组织流动书车，把书报送到忙人手里去。石家庄成立义务图书代借处，并把通俗的书籍和报纸，摆在公园茶社，任人阅览。以上办法都是尽量增加群众阅读书报机会的好方法。
    （４）举办市民文化技术学习。各文化馆除注意了工人教育，对一般市民文化学习也很注意。张家口上半年成立起民校四十处，男女学员二、六二七人。天津文化馆，附设妇女识字班、青年文化补习班、打字班、电务班、缝纫班，连工人班在内，共有六十四班，学员二、一二八名。石家庄的业余补习学校，有专用校址、专任教员、固定的经费，学生入学、编班、升级、毕业，都有一套比较完整的制度，成为市民文化学习正规化的典型。
    （５）成立社会服务部。在张家口、石家庄等地的文化馆都有此种设置。代群众写书信，解答问题，介绍职业等。并利用座谈会、家庭访问、交朋友等方式，作各种社会调查，了解每一个时期群众的思想动态和政策贯彻的情形，随时反映到领导机关，作为施政的重要参考，使文化馆成了政府联系人民的桥梁。
    （二）工作中的缺点和改进意见。正因为人民文化馆不同于旧的民教馆，一切工作要从新开辟创造，就现有的经验，还不可能规定出一套完整的办法，供各地遵循，工作中发生缺点是难免的。如旧民教馆的留用人员，由于官僚主义作风未尽克服，习惯于在馆内坐守，不习惯于积极主动的接近广大群众，因此，使工作开展受到限制。新建馆的地区，领导上有的对馆内问题解决不及时，以致影响干部工作情绪。如冀中区有的曾发生过仰赖募捐维持馆务，天寒地冻还发不下干部冬装等情形。汾阳文化馆前一个阶段，陷入到团结知识分子的小圈子里，忽视了广大群众的宣传教育。榆次文化馆在成立之初，买了大批理论书籍，对浅近的通俗读物和时事政策的宣传小册子，却买的很少。这些工作中的缺点，虽然有的已经克服，有的正在克服中，应引起今后的注意。
    （１）人民文化馆，不只是社教工作机关，更主要的是社教组织机关，它要成为城市社会教育活动的核心，它要善于组织各方面的力量，共同来作社教工作。人民文化馆是文化战线上的群众工作者，要组织应该组织可能组织起来的力量，把工作从馆内伸张到馆外去，把馆外的人又吸引到馆里来。只有如此，才能成为名符其实的人民文化馆。
    （２）干部配备要恰当。人民文化馆的干部，除具备一般干部条件之外，还须特别注意两点：第一作风活泼朴素，善于联系群众；第二能吃苦耐劳，肯于亲自下手。各级领导上配备干部时，要注意到这方面。同时也就是现任文化馆干部提高自己应该注意的问题。
    （３）人民文化馆的组织分工，总结各地的经验，一般的可分作：宣传股（包括广播、讲演、化装宣传、电影、幻灯、座谈、展览等），教导股（包括工人、市民、文化、技术补习教育等），书报阅览股（包括馆内、馆外的书报借阅与书报介绍等），社会服务股（包括问事、代笔、职业介绍、社会调查等）四股。体育活动可并入社会服务股（必要时亦可单设一股）；其他如团结改造旧艺人，领导组织话剧团等，就需要宣传股社会服务股共同配合进行。建立机构是根据工作繁简的需要，并以精简集中为原则，各地不能强求一律。分设四股，只作为参考意见。（摘自前华北人民政府教育部一九四九年九月二十日“华北区一年来社会教育工作总结”）
