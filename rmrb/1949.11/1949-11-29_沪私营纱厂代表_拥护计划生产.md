　　Support Planned Production
　　After the meeting concluded on the 22nd, the East China Textile Industry Department convened a symposium of representatives from Shanghai's public and private yarn factories on the 24th to discuss the coordination of production between public and private yarn factories. More than 50 representatives from public and private yarn factories attended the symposium, and Qian Zhiguang, Deputy Minister of the Central People's Government's Textile Industry Department, also attended to provide guidance. At the meeting, Liu Shaowen, Minister of the East China Textile Industry Department, first elaborated on the important decisions of the first East China Textile Industry Conference. He pointed out that future textile industry production plans must be based on the principle of self-reliance. He hoped that private yarn factories would cooperate closely with public yarn factories to prevent blind production and strive for possible favorable conditions to further reduce costs and increase production. In their speeches, representatives of private yarn factories unanimously supported planned production and provided many concrete and feasible suggestions, expressing their willingness to cooperate closely with public yarn factories to seek further development of the textile industry.
