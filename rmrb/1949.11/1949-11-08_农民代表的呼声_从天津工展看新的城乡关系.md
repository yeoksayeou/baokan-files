The Voice of the Peasant Representatives
    ——A New Urban-Rural Relationship Seen from the Tianjin Industrial Exhibition
    By our reporter Chen Ji
    The six-story Tianjin World Building was filled with joyous laughter, and the people of Tianjin were immersed in a warm welcome for the peasant representatives from North China. On the evening of November 4th, the working class of Tianjin welcomed their peasant brothers. Huang Huoqing, chairman of the Tianjin Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, said enthusiastically: "We workers and peasants are one family!" Wang Decai, a labor hero from Qingyuan, thanked the workers on behalf of the peasants, repeatedly shouting: "The workers are our elder brothers, we will follow the workers." Ten months ago, they were still separated by the reactionaries; today they are firmly united. The Chinese peasants, at the Tianjin Industrial Exhibition, personally witnessed the creations of the Chinese workers: the shapes of seeders, machine plows, looms, electric waterwheels, and electric incubators are forever imprinted in their minds. The opinion book in the iron and steel machinery exhibition room is filled with the handwriting of Chinese peasants determined to learn from the workers. Labor hero Wang Laohe tells people he meets: "With the enthusiasm and creativity of our workers, the days of machine-cultivated fields are not far off."

    When the peasant representatives visited the Tianjin Industrial Exhibition, they were most interested in agricultural implements, waterwheels, fertilizers, and insecticides, and they also cared about the types of export goods and daily necessities. They enthusiastically put forward many valuable opinions. When they saw the products of the North China Agricultural Machinery Factory, they all said in unison: "These things are very practical, the peasants will definitely buy them." However, based on their personal labor experience, they also put forward some valuable opinions. Zhang Fengyun said: The wheeled plow has no wheel disc at the rear, so after planting, it cannot be pushed home. Carrying a machine weighing hundreds of pounds on your body is too strenuous. Some thought that the curve of the single plow was too straight, and there was no wheel disc in the front, making it difficult to understand the standard of depth when using it, which was very inconvenient for planting. When they saw the ten-row seeder, they felt that the spacing between the rows was too dense, which was not suitable for the wide ridges in Hebei Province.

    The vast rural areas of North China often suffer from drought, and the peasant representatives enthusiastically requested the city to manufacture more waterwheels at the symposium. Han Shilin, a representative from Shijiazhuang, said: More than 15,000 waterwheels have been distributed to production in the Shijiazhuang area, and another 13,000 will be added recently, but they are still not enough. Insecticides are also urgently needed by the peasants, and they hope that "666" insecticide can be produced in large quantities. They felt that fertilizer powder and bone meal were too expensive. If the industrial sector plans to collect cattle and sheep bones in the countryside, the cost of bone meal will be reduced.

    The peasant representatives were very concerned about export goods. When they saw that chicken feathers, horsetails, walnuts, almonds, vegetable seed oil, egg products, etc. were all important export goods, they were excited. They said: "We have always used chicken feathers as fertilizer, we didn't know they could be exported." When the Chamber of Commerce invited peasants to a symposium, the representatives of the ten regions in Hebei Province introduced their export products in detail. Dang Yunshan, a representative from Linyu County in the Tangshan area, said: They produce 100,000 catties of walnuts every year, but few people buy them. Wang Zhizhou of Hengtong Export Company hurriedly said after hearing this: "Oh! I just found out that Linyu County produces walnuts. Tianjin City is currently worried about not having enough goods, we need them very urgently." The pepper produced in the Handan area, because there was no market, had all the trees cut down. The commercial representatives said: "Pepper is too useful, we hope the peasant representatives will go back and promote it well, we will definitely come to buy it." The mirabilite and niter produced in the Hengshui area were also unwanted, and they hoped that merchants would collect them. Reeds are a good raw material for papermaking, but for many years the peasants have burned them as firewood. Today, the peasant representatives looked at the industrial exhibition and said: "Reeds can be used to make paper, we will promote it more when we go back."

    Peasant representatives from Dingxian, Cangxian, Tangshan, Baoding, Hengshui, Handan and other areas all said that they produced a lot of cotton, but they said that the price of cotton was too low, and the peasants suffered too much when they sold it. In early October, every catty of lint cotton in Lixian, Hebei, could only be exchanged for seven catties of millet, and less than six catties of millet in Chengan County. Some merchants exchanged cotton for foreign cloth, soap, and other low-priced items, which damaged the interests of the peasants. They hoped to earnestly protect the interests of cotton farmers. Representatives of the Tianjin Chamber of Commerce said: "We sincerely accept your opinions."

    These days, the peasant representatives looked around the streets of Tianjin and felt that the general daily necessities were still too expensive. They hoped that the people of Tianjin would manufacture more durable and cheap goods. The representatives of the Xingtai area welcomed black and blue homespun cloth, and the representatives of the Tangshan area needed 20-count yarn and 3-strand twill cloth. They told reporters: "If the city makes more useful and cheap things, we can afford to buy them, and we will be willing to transport agricultural products into the city for exchange."

    The Tianjin industrial sector gave the peasant representatives matches, salty noodles, tooth powder, and cigarettes as gifts. They said that these gifts were souvenirs. After the industrial association invited the peasant representatives to a banquet, they also held a symposium to summarize the peasants' opinions, so as to review their past products and further enhance their determination to face the countryside. The merchants also hoped that the peasants would give them more opinions, and they made the determination to promote urban-rural trade. Wang Zhizhou, a representative of the merchants, said: "We were really sorry to the peasants in the past. After the Communist Party's education, we understand; today I will definitely serve the peasants well." Representatives of the freight industry said: "We welcome you to transport local goods here, and we will provide free accommodation. We only earn 1% profit."

    In the World Building, worker representatives, peasant representatives, industrial representatives, and commercial representatives sat together and talked happily. They were united, and I saw the close connection between urban and rural relations for the first time.

　　农民代表的呼声
    ——从天津工展看新的城乡关系
    本报记者  陈迹
    六层楼的天津世界大楼充溢了欢乐的笑声，天津市人民浸沉在欢迎华北农民代表的热潮里。十一月四日的晚上，津市的工人阶级欢迎他们的农民的弟兄，市总工会主任黄火青热情地说：“咱们工农本是一家人！”清苑劳动英雄王德才代表农民答谢，一再地喊道：“工人是咱们的老大哥，咱们跟着工人走。”十个月以前，他们还是被反动派隔开在两地；今天他们已牢牢地团结在一起了。中国农民在津市工业展览会里亲眼看见了中国工人的创造：播种机、机器犁、织布机、电力水车和电力孵卵机器的形样永远印在他们的脑海里。钢铁机械展览室的意见簿上写满了中国农民决心向工人学习的字迹。劳动英雄王老合逢人民就说：“有了咱们工人的积极性和创造性，机器耕种田地的日子不远了。”
    农民代表们参观天津工展时，最喜欢农具、水车、肥料和杀虫剂，也关心着出口物资的种类和日常的用品。他们热情地提出了许多宝贵的意见。他们看了华北农业机械厂的生产品，都异口同声的说：“这些家伙很实用，农民一定会购买。”但是，他们根据亲身劳动的经验，也提出一些宝贵的意见，张凤云说：带轮犁的后底没有轮盘，种完了地，不能推着送回家去，百来斤的机器扛在身上太费力。有的以为单把犁的弯子太直，前面又没有轮盘，使用起来难了解深浅的标准，种地太不方便。他们看见了十行播种机，觉行它的行间过密，不适于河北省宽垄的使用。
    华北广大农村时常遭旱灾，农民代表们在座谈会上热烈要求城市多制造水车。石门代表韩世林说：石门专区分配到生产中去的水车已有一万五千多个，最近还要增加一万三千个，仍嫌不够应用。杀虫剂也是农民们迫切需要的，他们希望“六六六”杀虫剂能够大量出产。肥田粉和骨粉他们都觉得价钱太贵，如果工业界有计划地去乡村搜集牛骨羊骨，骨粉的成本是会降低的。
    农民代表们十分关心着出口物。当他们看见了鸡毛、马尾、核桃、杏仁、菜籽油、蛋品等等都是重要的出口物，他们兴奋了。他们说：“咱们从来就把鸡毛当肥田粉用了，不知它还能出口。”在商会邀请农民座谈时，河北十个专区的代表都详细地介绍了他们的出口土产。唐山专区临榆县代表党云山说：他们每年产核十万斤，很少人去购买。亨通出口行的王芷洲听了以后，急忙的说：“哎呀！我才知道临榆县出核桃。现在天津市上正愁着没货，我们需要得很迫切。”邯郸专区出产的花椒，因无销路，都把树砍掉了。商民代表说：“花椒太有用哪，希望农民代表回去好好宣传，我们一定来收买。”衡水专区出产的皮硝、火硝，也一样地没人要，他们希望商家去搜集。苇子是制纸的很好原料，可惜多年来农民把它当作柴禾烧了。今天农民代表看了工展，连说：“苇子能造纸，回去多宣传。”
    定县、沧县、唐山、保定、衡水、邯郸等专区农民代表都说他们那里盛产棉花，但他们说，棉花价钱太贱了，农民卖出去，太吃亏了。十月初，河北蠡县每斤皮棉只能换到七斤小米，成安县还合不到六斤小米。有些商人用洋布、肥皂等低价换棉，对农民利益有损。他们希望认真保护棉农利益。津市商会代表说：“我们很诚恳地接受你们的意见。”
    这几天来，农民代表们在津市街头看了看，觉得一般的日用品还是太贵了。他们希望津市人民多制造些比较结实的价廉的货物，邢台专区的代表都非常欢迎黑色和蓝色的土布，唐山专区的代表需要二十支纱和三支两股斜纹布。他们对记者说：“城市里多做些有用的便宜的东西，咱们才买得起，咱们才愿意把农产品运进城来交换。”
    津市工业界赠给农民代表以火柴、咸面、牙粉和香烟，他们说这些礼物是纪念品，工业会邀宴了农民代表之后，也举行了座谈会，把农民们的意见综合在一起，以便评阅他们以往的生产品，进一步增强他们面向农村的决心。商人们也一样地希望农民们多给他们提意见，他们立下了促进城乡贸易的决心。商人代表王芷洲说：“从前我们真对不起农民，经过共产党的教育，我们明白了；今天我一定好好为农民服务。”货栈业代表说：“我们欢迎你们把土货运来，免费招待你们住宿，我们只赚百分之一的利钱。”
    在世界大楼里，工人代表、农民代表、工业代表、商业代表坐在一起欢谈，他们团结起来了，我第一次真正看见了城乡关系的亲密联系。
