Sisters across the country:
    The Asian Women's Representative Conference decided by the International Democratic Women's Federation will be held in Beijing, the capital of New China, from December 6th to 12th this year. Representatives from the International Democratic Women's Federation participating in the preparatory work, Simone Bertrand, representatives from the Soviet Women's Anti-Fascist Committee, Malosova and Yeremeyeva, representatives from the Soviet Asian Republic of Kyrgyzstan, Toktomanbetova, and Korean women representatives Kim Gui-sun and Ahn Hyo-sang, have all arrived in Beijing. The All-China Democratic Women's Federation has also appointed Cai Chang, Li Dequan, Zhang Qinqiu, and Lu Cui to form a preparatory work committee for the Asian Women's Representative Conference with them to carry out preparatory work.
    The agenda of this representative conference will include the following four items:
    (1) Asian women's struggle for national independence, democracy, and peace (report by China)
    (2) Defending women's rights (report by Iran)
    (3) Defending children's rights (report by India)
    (4) The International Democratic Women's Federation's struggle to defend world peace (report by the International Democratic Women's Federation)
    The official representatives attending this conference will include 24 Asian countries such as the six Asian republics of the Soviet Union, China, Mongolia, and North Korea. Guests will include representatives from the Soviet Union, Britain, France, the United States, the Netherlands, and five African countries. Two representatives from the International Democratic Women's Federation will also come to provide guidance.
    Chinese women should greet this Asian Women's Representative Conference with great enthusiasm. Because this conference has the following important significance:
    (1) This will be a conference of great solidarity among Asian women. Today, there are various types of countries in Asia, and the status and lives of women in each country are also different. Like the several Asian republics of the Soviet Union—Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Azerbaijan—which are socialist countries, the women there are completely liberated, enjoying true gender equality, and living infinitely happy lives. Our People's Republic of China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and others are new democratic countries; women in these countries have also obtained equal rights with men in politics, economics, and society. As for countries like India, Malaya, Indonesia, Burma, and Siam, which are colonial and semi-colonial countries, women in these countries are still living miserable lives of slavery under the rule of imperialism, feudal forces, and other reactionary forces. But they are becoming increasingly aware and are also fighting heroically for national liberation and their own liberation. The purpose of the Asian Women's Representative Conference is to bring together women representatives from these different types of countries, unite, learn from each other, exchange experiences, and establish deep friendships to jointly oppose imperialism, feudalism, and wars of aggression, and to jointly struggle for national independence, people's democracy, for defending lasting world peace, and the rights that women and children should have.
    (2) The Asian Women's Representative Conference will also be a conference of great solidarity between Asian women and democratic women around the world. The great victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War and the liberation struggles of the people of Southeast Asian countries have severely hit imperialism and the new war conspiracy of the imperialist bloc headed by US imperialism, thus making a great contribution to the struggle of people all over the world for lasting world peace. Women have played a great role in the liberation struggles of these countries. The International Democratic Women's Federation is convening this conference in order to support the heroic struggles of Asian women and strengthen solidarity with Asian women. Through this conference, Asian women will unite more closely with democratic women around the world and work together to defend lasting world peace and the welfare of women and children.
    The success of the Chinese People's Revolution and the great victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War not only made it possible for this conference to be held smoothly in China, but also made the content of this conference more substantial. Because the heroic struggle and great victory of Chinese women have given women in various colonial and semi-colonial countries in Asia a powerful inspiration and example: the Chinese people who have been oppressed by feudalism for thousands of years and invaded by imperialism for more than a hundred years have finally stood up, finally defeated all internal and external reactionary forces, and established their own country. This shows that the oppressed people in all colonial and semi-colonial countries can also stand up, and can also defeat all internal and external reactionary forces and stand on their own. The many rich and heroic fighting experiences of Chinese women can be adopted by sisters in various countries. The victory of the Chinese people and Chinese women will give oppressed people and women in all countries infinite courage and confidence. For Chinese women, the central task today is to build a new China. The Soviet sisters who are participating in this conference have very rich experience in national construction and can be our teachers. We must humbly learn from them, acquire their experience, work hard and strive to catch up. In addition, the representatives of Mongolia and North Korea who are participating in this conference are like sisters of the same age to us. We can exchange experiences and learn from each other, and work hand in hand for a common cause.
    Sisters across the country! The fact that the Asian Women's Representative Conference can be held in New China today shows that: due to the great victory of the Chinese People's Revolution, the international status of Chinese women has been further improved. Our international responsibilities have also increased accordingly. Therefore, every Chinese woman has a responsibility to do a good job in preparing for this conference and to use active actions to ensure the conference's victorious success.
    Therefore, I call on the sisters across the country:
    (1) You must study and implement the "Notice on Preparing for the Asian Women's Representative Conference" issued by the All-China Democratic Women's Federation on November 1st, respond to this call, and do all the specific preparations well.
    (2) You must enthusiastically launch discussions on the conference agenda and bring your opinions to your representatives.
    (3) You must enthusiastically participate in all production undertakings and other work to welcome this conference. I call on female workers in factories to learn technology, improve quality, increase production, and actively join the Youth League and the Federation of Trade Unions. Rural women should actively participate in land reform and participate in agricultural labor and sideline production in large numbers. Female teachers, female doctors, and female sisters in all walks of life and all female intellectuals should study hard, transform themselves, give full play to the enthusiasm of your work, establish a viewpoint of serving the people, and participate in organizations in all walks of life.
    (4) You must also fully support the Liberation War in order to accelerate the complete annihilation of the reactionaries, so that the war will end victoriously in China one day sooner.
    Finally, I emphasize that we must not only care about and support this conference, but also give greater play to the spirit of combining internationalism and patriotism in the future, care about the suffering of oppressed women in Asia and around the world, and use great efforts to support their struggles. We must strengthen solidarity with democratic women around the world and work together for world peace and the liberation of women.

　　迎接亚洲妇女代表会议
    中华全国民主妇女联合会主席蔡畅十一月九日在北京新华广播电台演讲全国姊妹们：
    国际民主妇女联合会决定召开的亚洲妇女代表会议，将要在今年十二月六日至十二日在新中国首都北京举行了。国际民主妇联派来参加筹备工作的代表西门贝特朗、苏联妇女反法西斯委员会代表玛洛索娃、耶列梅耶娃、苏联亚洲共和国吉尔吉斯代表托克托曼别托娃和朝鲜妇女代表金贵善及安孝相等，都已经到了北京。中华全国民主妇女联合会，也推定了蔡畅、李德全、张琴秋、陆璀四个人和她们共同组成亚洲妇女代表会议筹备工作委员会，进行筹备工作。
    这个代表会议的议程将要包括如下四项：
    （一）亚洲妇女为民族独立、民主与和平而斗争（由中国作报告）
    （二）保卫妇女权利（由伊朗作报告）
    （三）保卫儿童权利（由印度作报告）
    （四）国际妇联为保卫世界和平而奋斗（由国际妇联作报告）
    参加这个会议的正式代表将有苏联的六个亚洲共和国、中国、蒙古、朝鲜等二十四个亚洲国家。来宾方面将有苏联、英国、法国、美国、荷兰等国及非洲五个国家的代表。国际民主妇联也将有两位代表前来指导。
    中国妇女应该以高度的热情，来迎接这个亚洲妇女代表会议。因为这个会议，有以下几个重要的意义：
    （一）这将是一个亚洲妇女大团结的会议。亚洲今天存在着各种不同类型的国家，各国妇女的地位和生活也各不相同。象苏联的几个亚洲共和国——乌滋伯克、哈萨克、达吉克、土库曼、吉尔吉斯、阿塞倍疆是社会主义的国家，那里的妇女，是彻底解放了的，享受着真正的男女平等，过着无限幸福的生活。我们中华人民共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国等，则是新民主主义的国家；这些国家的妇女，也已经获得了在政治上、经济上、社会上各方面和男子平等的权利。至于象印度、马来亚、印度尼西亚、缅甸、暹逻等则是殖民地半殖民地的国家，这些国家的妇女，还在帝国主义封建势力和其他反动势力统治之下，过着悲惨的奴隶生活。可是她们正在日益觉醒起来，同样在为民族的解放和自身的解放而英勇地斗争。亚洲妇女代表会议的目的，就是要把这些不同类型国家的妇女代表，集合在一起，团结一致，相互学习，交换经验，建立深厚的友谊，来共同反对帝国主义、封建主义和侵略战争，为争取民族的独立，人民的民主，为保卫世界的持久和平，和妇女儿童应有的权利而共同奋斗。
    （二）亚洲妇女代表会议，同时又将是亚洲妇女和全世界民主妇女大团结的会议。中国人民解放战争的伟大胜利以及东南亚各国人民的解放斗争，严重地打击了帝国主义，严重地打击了以美帝为首的帝国主义集团的新战争阴谋，因而对于全世界人民争取世界持久和平的斗争，有着很大的贡献。在这些国家的解放斗争中，妇女都起了伟大的作用。国际民主妇联就是为了要声援亚洲妇女们的英勇斗争，并加强和亚洲妇女的团结，才召开这个会议。经过这个会议，亚洲妇女将和世界民主妇女更加亲密的团结起来，共同为保卫世界的持久和平以及妇女儿童的福利而努力奋斗。
    中国人民革命的成功和中国人民解放战争的伟大胜利，不仅使这个会议可以顺利地在中国召开，而且将使这个会议的内容更加充实。因为中国妇女的英勇奋斗和伟大胜利，给了亚洲各殖民地半殖民地国家的妇女一个有力的启示和榜样：受了几千年封建压迫和一百多年帝国主义侵略的中国人民终于翻身了，终于战胜了一切内外反动势力而建立了自己的国家。这就说明，一切殖民地半殖民地国家被压迫的人民同样也可以翻身，同样也可以战胜一切内外反动势力而自己站起来。中国妇女许多丰富的英勇的斗争经验，是可以供各国姊妹来采取的。中国人民和中国妇女的胜利，将给予各国受压迫的人民及妇女以无限的勇气和信心，在中国妇女方面来说，今天的中心任务是建设新中国，参加这次会议的苏联姐妹们她们对建国具有着极丰富的经验，是可以作为我们的老师的。我们必须向她们虚心学习，取得她们的经验，刻苦自励，迎头赶上。此外，参加这个会议的蒙古和朝鲜等国的代表，对我们又好象是同年的姊妹，我们和她们可以彼此交换经验，互相学习。为共同的事业而携手前进。
    全国的姊妹们！亚洲妇女代表会议今天能在新中国召开，它说明着：由于中国人民革命的伟大胜利，使得中国妇女的国际地位更加提高了。我们的国际责任也就同样加重了。因此我们每一个中国的妇女，都应有责任要把这个会议的筹备工作做好。并应用积极的行动来保证大会的胜利成功。
    因此，我号召全国的姊妹：
    （一）你们必须研究和执行中华全国民主妇女联合会十一月一日发出的关于准备亚洲妇女代表会议的通知，响应这个号召，把一切具体准备工作做好。
    （二）你们要热烈地展开对于大会议程的讨论，并且把你们的意见交给你们的代表带来。
    （三）你们要热烈的参加一切生产事业及其他工作来迎接这个会议。我号召工厂的女工们要学习技术，改进质量，提高生产，要积极的加入青年团和联工会。农妇们要积极地参加土改，并大量参加农业劳动和副业生产。女教师，女医生，以及各行各业的妇女姊妹及一切女知识分子们，都应努力学习，改造自己，发挥你们工作的积极性，建立为人民服务的观点，并参加各行各业的组织。
    （四）你们又必须全力支援解放战争，才能加速对反动派的全部消灭，使战争早一天在中国胜利结束。
    最后，我强调指出，我们不仅要关心和拥护这个会议，而且今后要更加高度的发挥国际主义与爱国主义相结合的精神，关心全亚洲与全世界被压迫妇女的痛苦，并且用极大的力量来支援她们的斗争。我们要和全世界的民主妇女加强团结，共同为世界和平与妇女解放而奋斗。
