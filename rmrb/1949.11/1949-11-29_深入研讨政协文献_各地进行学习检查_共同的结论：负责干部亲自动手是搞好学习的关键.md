　　In-depth Study of CPPCC Documents: Local Areas Conduct Learning Inspections
　　Common Conclusion: Responsible Cadres Taking the Lead is Key to Successful Learning
　　[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] Inspections of the study of the CPPCC documents have been underway in various localities since mid-November. The inspections focus on study leadership and learning effectiveness. Some areas are conducting the inspections directly through leading organs, while others are doing so through the masses, the latter being the method adopted in Suzhou, Jiangsu, and other places. In Suzhou, Changshu, Taicang and other counties and cities, either units hold universal tests separately, or certain units are selected for spot checks, in order to understand the learning situation. The common conclusion reached in various localities points out that in order to do a good job of studying, first, leaders must genuinely attach importance to study and take the lead in order to promote a learning upsurge in the entire unit; second, extensive mobilization must be carried out to create a mass movement; third, it must be linked to current work and individual thinking. Only in this way can we achieve the effect of understanding the spirit of the documents, improving thinking, and improving work. The quality of leadership is key to how well a unit learns. Among the provincial-level organs and organizations in Hebei Province, the Provincial Public Security Department has done a better job of studying. Lu Zhiguo, Deputy Director of the Department, personally arranged the study, conducted in-depth inspections, and solved difficult problems, and created a number of good methods. As a result, the department has improved its work and enhanced unity through the study. The Provincial Health Department, on the other hand, pushed the responsibility of leading the study to the study secretary, resulting in the separation of study organization from administration. Problems raised by comrades were not resolved, and the enthusiasm for learning generally declined. In the study of various units in Dalian, those who have done well are also due to the responsible cadres taking the lead and organizing reports and discussions. For example, after receiving the study task, the CPC Dalian Zhongshan District Committee first convened a meeting of propaganda cadres to study the issue of organizational leadership and deploy the study. Then a large report meeting was held, and discussion meetings were organized every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. The District Committee also took the time to give workers a weekly report on the Common Program and other issues. As a result, everyone was in a good mood for learning and believed that "national affairs must be learned." Those who study poorly, on the other hand, are due to the fact that the leaders have not carried out specific deployment and inspection work. For example, the Water Bureau and the Electricity Bureau only issued a call and then left it at that. As a result, Group A relied on reports from higher levels and did not raise any questions, Group B started out well, but soon fell into drift because the leadership did not pay close attention, and the workers did not learn at all.
　　In order to deepen the study, various localities have put forward guiding opinions after inspection. After the Propaganda Department of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee issued a notice on October 12, it reissued a notice in mid-November because it had only received reports from a few provinces, ordering the propaganda departments of the provincial and municipal party committees to conscientiously organize, inspect, and supervise the study of cadres at all levels. The notice pointed out that "some places have delayed studying under the pretext of being busy with work, or are studying carelessly, which is very wrong." The notice wrote: "We must recognize that the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is the full content of our party's current stage program, is the guide to action for the party and the people, and is a weapon for mastering policies, organizing forces and striving for victory. Neglecting the study and research of the above documents is an impermissible political error." The Propaganda Department of the CPC Qingdao Municipal Committee, in view of the fact that many units have failed to carry out the study as planned, issued a supplementary notice and formulated a study outline to be sent to each unit. At a meeting of study group leaders of various branches held by the Hebei Provincial Military Direct Learning Committee Branch in mid-November, Zhou Zhiyuan, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Military Region Political Department, gave tips on correcting learning deviations. After affirming the learning achievements, such as a further understanding of the party's united front policy, etc., he criticized several incorrect viewpoints and methods: 1. Some comrades raise questions focusing on personal interests; 2. They are satisfied with understanding the literal meaning and do not go into depth. Minister Zhou also provided improved opinions on study methods.
　　Generally speaking, the study of CPPCC documents is being carried out intensely in various localities, but the progress is quite uneven. Some made arrangements as early as October, while others were as late as mid-November, but all have achieved certain results. Currently, those with faster progress, such as the directly affiliated organs of the CPC Bohai District Committee, are nearing the end of their study and are arranging for summaries.

　　深入研讨政协文献　各地进行学习检查
    共同的结论：负责干部亲自动手是搞好学习的关键
    【本报特讯】对人民政协文献学习情况的检查，自本月中旬以来，各地即已先后展开。检查着重于学习领导和学习效果。检查的方法，有的是由领导机关直接进行的，有的则是通过群众进行的，后者是江苏苏州等地采用的方法。苏州、常熟、太仓等县市，或则各单位分别普遍举行测验，或则抽考某些单位，以便了解学习情况。各地检查所得的共同结论指明，要搞好学习，第一，必须首长切实重视学习，亲自带领，以推动整个单位卷入学习热潮；第二，必须进行广泛动员，造成群众性的运动；第三，要与当前工作以及个人思想联系起来，只有如此，才能收领会文件精神、提高思想、改进工作之效。而领导的好坏，则又是一个单位学习好坏的关键。在河北省省级各机关团体中，省府公安厅学习较好。该厅副厅长陆治国亲自布置学习，深入检查，解决疑难问题，并创造了若干好的方法，因而该厅经过学习，改进了工作，增强了团结。而省府卫生厅则由于把领导学习的责任，推给学习秘书，致使学习组织与行政分家，同志们提出的问题得不到解决，学习情绪普遍低落下去。大连市各单位的学习，凡是搞得好的，也是由于负责干部亲自动手，组织报告与讨论。如中共大连中山区委接受学习任务之后，首先召开了宣传干部会议，研究了组织领导问题，把学习布置下去。接着举行了大的报告会，每星期一、三、五则组织讨论会，区委并抽出时间，每周向工人作一次共同纲领等问题的报告，结果大家学习情绪很好，都认为“国家大事，不可不学”。而凡是学习较差的，则是由于领导人员没有进行具体的布置检查工作。如水道局、电业局只是号召了一下，就百事大吉了，结果甲组依赖上级报告，没提出问题，乙组开始学得还好，由于领导上抓得不紧，很快自流下去，而工人则根本没有去学习。
    为使学习深入一步，各地经过检查，均提出了指导意见。中共中央东北局宣传部自十月十二日发出通知后，因只收到少数省份的报告，乃于本月中旬再次发出通知，责成各省市党委宣传部门认真组织、检查、督促各级干部学习。通知指出“有些地方借口工作忙推迟不学，或马虎学习，这是很不对的”。通知写道：“必须认识中国人民政协的共同纲领乃是我党现阶段政纲的全部内容，是党和人民的行动指南，是掌握政策、组织力量争取胜利的斗争武器，忽视对上述文件的学习与研究是一种不可允许的政治错误。”中共青岛市委宣传部因鉴于许多单位未能按计划进行学习，特发出补充通知，并拟定学习提纲发给各个单位。河北省军直学委分会于本月中旬举行的各支会学习小组长会议上，军区政治部宣传部周致远部长提示了纠正学习偏向的办法。他在肯定了学习成绩，如对党的统一战线政策有了进一步的认识等等之后，批判了几种不正确的观点方法：一、有的同志提问题着眼于个人利益；二、满足于字面了解，不去深钻。周部长并对学习方法提供了改进的意见。
    总的说来，各地对政协文献的学习，均正紧张进行，但进度颇不一致，有的早在十月即作了布置，有的则迟至本月中旬，不过均已收到一定效果。现进度较快的，如中共渤海区区党委直属机关，学习已近结束，正布置总结。
