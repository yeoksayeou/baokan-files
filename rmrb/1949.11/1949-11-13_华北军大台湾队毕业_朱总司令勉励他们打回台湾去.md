    Commander-in-Chief Zhu Encourages Them to Fight Back to Taiwan
    [Our Newspaper's Report] The Taiwan Team students of Hua Bei Military and Political University have recently graduated after two years of study. On the morning of November 1st, a graduation ceremony was held. Commander-in-Chief Zhu, Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League Chairman and CPPCC Representative Xie Xuehong, Lin Kengsheng, and Yang Cheng, Education Director of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League Central School, attended the meeting and delivered speeches. Commander-in-Chief Zhu encouraged everyone, saying: After the students of the Taiwan Team graduate, they must fight back to Taiwan. This is the hope of the students and also their glorious task. We must liberate all of China's territory, including Taiwan. Everyone must be clear that Taiwan will always belong to the Chinese people. Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League Chairman Xie Xuehong said: "The current situation in Taiwan is such that the reactionaries are still making their last stand there, implementing brutal rule, and the people's survival is facing a serious threat. Therefore, the people of Taiwan are eagerly awaiting you to quickly fight to Taiwan and liberate your parents, wives, brothers, sisters, and your friends." Lin Kengsheng, the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League representative of the CPPCC, said: "The central government leaders are so concerned about the liberation of Taiwan, and I, on behalf of the people of Taiwan, pay my respects to the central government. Under the cultivation of the Military and Political University, the students have established the idea of serving the people. This is the gain of all the students and they must take this to Taiwan!" Student representative Lin Yuzhang spoke, and he made a guarantee, saying: "We must resolutely obey the orders of our superiors and complete the arduous and great task of advancing. We must liberate Taiwan, the last base of the Chiang bandits, and smash the imperialist conspiracy of the U.S.!" The meeting adjourned amidst enthusiastic slogans.
