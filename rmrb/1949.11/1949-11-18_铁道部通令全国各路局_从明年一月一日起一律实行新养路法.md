　　Ministry of Railways Issues Circular to All Railway Bureaus Nationwide
  　New Railway Maintenance Method to be Implemented Universally from January 1st Next Year
    【Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 17th】In order to strengthen railway maintenance work across the country and improve line quality and railway transport capacity, the Ministry of Railways issued a circular to all railway bureaus on the 4th of this month, stating that starting from January 1st next year, the new railway maintenance method will be universally implemented on all railways nationwide. The new railway maintenance method absorbs advanced Soviet experience and divides railway maintenance operations into three categories: major repairs, medium repairs, and routine maintenance. It also implements a system of contracted repairs, contracted maintenance, and contracted inspection. Each railway management district should formulate a precise plan for next year's railway maintenance projects based on the overall condition of the lines under its jurisdiction, as well as its labor force and technical capabilities. Major and medium repair projects will be carried out by contracted repair teams. Lines that have been repaired will be handed over to contracted maintenance teams after being inspected and accepted according to standards. Contracted maintenance teams will be responsible for routine repair work to maintain a certain quality of the lines. Contracted inspection teams are responsible for regular track patrol and inspection work for certain lines and can handle minor repairs. This constant, clearly defined railway maintenance system is very different from the old railway maintenance method, which did not involve regular maintenance. The new railway maintenance method was implemented in Northeast China in the first half of this year and achieved significant results. In order to rapidly and universally establish the new railway maintenance method across the country, the Ministry of Railways transferred four new railway maintenance method demonstration work teams from the Northeast Railway Administration on the 5th of this month and dispatched them to the Shanghai, Tianjin, Zhengzhou, and Jinan railway bureaus respectively to demonstrate the new railway maintenance method. All teams have now arrived at their designated railway bureaus.

　　铁道部通令全国各路局
  　从明年一月一日起一律实行新养路法
    【新华社北京十七日电】铁道部为加强全国铁路的养路工作，以提高线路质量和铁路运转力，特于本月四日通令全国各铁路局，从明年一月一日起，全国各铁路一律实行新养路法。新养路法是吸收苏联先进的经验，将养路作业分为大修、中修和经常养路三种，并实行包修、包养、包检的制度。各铁路工管区应根据自己管辖内的全部线路情况以及劳力技术等情况，分别作出明年养路工程的精密计划。大修、中修工程即由包修班补修，经补修的线路根据标准验收后交包养班。包养班则负责经常的修补工作，以保持线路的一定质量。包检班是负责一定线路的经常的巡道检查工作和可以胜任的零星修补。这种经常的责任分明的养路制度，与平时不养路的旧养路法有很大的区别。新养路法已于今年上半年在东北开始实行，获得了显著的成绩。铁道部为使新养路法迅速地普遍地在全国建立起来，特在本月五日从东北铁路总局调来四个新养路法示范工作队，分别派往上海、天津、郑州和济南等四路局作新养路法的示范作业。现各队均已到达其指定的路局。
