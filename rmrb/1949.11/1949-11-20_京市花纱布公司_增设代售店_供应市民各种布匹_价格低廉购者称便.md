　　Beijing Municipal Flower and Cotton Cloth Company
    Increases Retail Outlets
  　Supplying Citizens with Various Fabrics
  　Prices are Low, Convenient for Purchasers
    [This Newspaper's Report] To directly supply the needs of citizens for winter clothing and bedding, the Beijing Branch of the Flower and Cotton Cloth Company has successively established retail outlets in the city to sell various fabrics. Starting from the 14th of this month, the first three locations were established at Sanxin East in Tianqiao, Huatonghao in Dongsi Arch, and Qianyilong on Huashi Street outside Chongwen Gate. Judging from the recent sales situation at the Sanxin East, Huatong, and Qianyilong retail outlets, the company's method of dispatching personnel to supervise and entrust private merchants with retail sales can prevent malpractices and is quite applicable. The retail outlets are relatively well-equipped, and with skilled personnel, the procedure is extremely simple. Citizens purchasing at the Qianyilong retail outlet spend a total of five or six minutes from opening a sales slip to paying and picking up the goods. The types of fabrics sold at each retail outlet currently include: white cloth (Second Factory Red Five Blessings, Green Sunshine), blue cloth (Qianmen Brand), navy cloth (Haichang Xinglan, Qianmen Brand), red cloth (Nafutuo, New Life Brand), as well as military grey cloth, striped cloth, flannel, and more than a dozen other varieties. The quantity purchased is a minimum of one foot per person per purchase and a maximum of no more than fifty feet. As of the evening of the 19th, the five retail outlets had sold a total of more than 50,400 feet of various cotton fabrics, with more than 1,600 citizens purchasing cotton fabrics. White cloth sold the most among the various fabrics, followed by blue and navy cloth. As for the retail prices at the retail outlets, all fabrics are 20% to 30% lower than private merchants (including cloth shops and cloth vendors). Citizens who purchased are generally satisfied with this method. Some citizens also suggested that, in order to prevent private merchants from reselling for profit and depriving the people of their interests, the supervisory personnel dispatched by the company should pay close attention to those who purchase a large quantity each time. When necessary, the amount of each purchase can be reduced to prevent speculation and hoarding by merchants.
    [Another Report] The Zhenhua Industrial Company in Dongsi Arch has completed the preparation of cotton cloth retail equipment and is scheduled to start selling on the 20th. The Beijing Supply and Marketing Cooperative General Agency (at Xidan Arch) and the Farmers' Hostel (at Langfang Toutiao) have also finalized matters related to retail sales and are scheduled to start retail business from the 21st.

　　京市花纱布公司
    增设代售店
  　供应市民各种布匹
  　价格低廉购者称便
    【本报讯】北京花纱布分公司，为直接供应市民冬季添置衣服被褥之需要，于市内陆续辟设代售店，零售各种布匹。自本月十四日起，首先在天桥三信东、东四牌楼华通号、崇外花市大街谦益隆设立三处。于十八日又相继在鼓楼南大街乾泰隆、西四牌楼合义祥增设两处。根据三信东、华通、谦益隆三代售店近日售卖情形来看，该公司所采用的派员监督委托私商代售的办法能防止弊端，颇为适用。代售店设备比较完善，再加技术熟练，施行起来，手续极为简捷。市民在谦益隆代售店购买，由开提单到交款取货，总共需时五、六分钟。各代售店售卖布匹种类，目前有：白布（二厂红五福、绿阳光）、青布（前门牌）、蓝布（海昌性蓝、前门牌）、红布（纳富妥、新生牌）以及军灰色布、条布、线呢等十数种。购买数量，每人每次最低需买一尺，最多不得超过五十尺。截至十九日晚，五个代售店先后共售出各种棉布五万零四百余尺，购买棉布的市民有一千六百余人。各种布匹中以白布售出最多，其次为青、蓝色布。至代售店零售价格，各种布匹一律较私商（包括布店及布摊贩）低百分之二十至三十。往购市民对此种办法均表满意。有的市民并提出：为防止私商套购剥夺人民利益，公司所派遣之监督人员应严密注意每次购买数量较多者，必要时可缩小每次购买量以防止投机商贩之套购等建议。
    【又讯】东四牌楼震华实业公司代售棉布设备已准备完竣，定于二十日开始售卖。京市供销合作总社门市部（在西单牌楼）、农民招待所（在廊房头条）等单位代售事宜亦已洽妥，预定于二十一日起开始代售业务。
