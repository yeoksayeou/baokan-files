　　Carrying out mass education work
　　Fu Jen Catholic University establishes a special organization
　　150 Education Department students participate
　　[This newspaper's report] Fu Jen Catholic University established an Adult Mass Education Work Committee on the 4th to uniformly lead the school's mass education work. All professors, assistants, lecturers, and Education Department students attended the founding meeting of the committee. At the meeting, Ouyang Xiang, the head of the Education Department, explained that mass education work is an important task of the Education Department, and encouraged students to actively participate in this work. All 150 students in the Education Department have signed up to participate in mass education work and have been assigned tasks: first-year students observe, and second- and third-year students teach directly. Since Fu Jen Catholic University started mass education work, there have been three children's literacy classes with more than 450 students; there have been five workers' literacy classes with more than 300 students; and there have been more than 50 women in literacy classes. They have made a lot of progress in their work in close cooperation with the district government, and they will continue to expand the scope of mass education work in the future.

　　[This newspaper's report] Amidst the upsurge of social education promotion, the Mathematics Department of Normal University is sponsoring a mathematics tutoring night school. After several days of preparation, it has been decided that registration will begin on November 8th. Technical workers and senior and junior high school students with a slight mathematical foundation will be recruited free of charge. The registration deadline is the 10th. Because it is newly established, eight courses will be temporarily offered, including higher algebra, high school analytic geometry, solid geometry, plane geometry, plane trigonometry, junior high school algebra, geometry, and arithmetic, with eleven classes. This is another effort by Normal University following the children's literacy and women's literacy classes. (Normal University Correspondent Group)
