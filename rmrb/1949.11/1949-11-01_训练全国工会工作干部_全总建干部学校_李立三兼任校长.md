　　Li Lisan Concurrently Serves as Principal
　　[By Our Newspaper] To strengthen the leadership of trade unions and improve the theoretical and professional level of trade union cadres, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions has decided to rename the North China Staff and Workers Cadre School as the All-China Federation of Trade Unions Cadre School. Li Lisan, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, will concurrently serve as Principal, with Di Zicai and Zhang Yunying as Vice-Principals. Cadres from various industrial sectors and regions will be trained in rotation. The school address remains in Tianjin. After a short period of active preparation, the organizational structure of the school has been established. The educational policy of the school is to emphasize both theoretical and professional education. Theoretical education will focus on historical materialism, combined with the basic problems of the Chinese revolution. Professional education will be based on the various resolutions of the National Trade Union Work Conference, combined with the actual problems and experiences in the current workers' movement. Currently, students from Wuhan, Shanghai, Kaifeng, Taiyuan, Tangshan, and Shenyang have arrived in Tianjin to register. The students attach great importance to the three major documents of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and are now organized into temporary groups for study.
