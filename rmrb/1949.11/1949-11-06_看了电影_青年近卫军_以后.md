　　After Seeing the Movie "The Young Guard"
　　Liu Baiyu

　　After seeing Comrade Fadeyev's original work and Comrade Gerasimov's directed film "The Young Guard", I feel that my thoughts and feelings have been elevated. I feel that this is a victory for the progressive humanity led by the Soviet Union in the world, a victory for struggle, and a victory for literature and art. Recently, I have often been thinking about a question in my mind, that is, the world's literature and art, during the Soviet-German War, took a big step forward, not just a general step, but an epoch-making one. Because literature and art, as a weapon of the people's struggle, serve the political struggle, and have never been so closely combined, so powerfully promoted the struggle, so powerfully, brilliantly, and richly as in the Soviet-German War.

　　When I saw the Young Guard comrades, headed by Oleg, Lyuba, Ulia, and Chulenin, who were loyal to the Soviet Union (and to the whole world) and were finally captured by the fascists, heading to the execution ground bravely and generously, I couldn't hold back my tears. Was I sad? No, I solemnly and joyfully saw that such truly excellent people had emerged in the world, this is the victory of communism. Such people are brave and beautiful, the most complete and ideal people in the world. Such people are as pure and brave as flames in the struggle. Such people could not have been produced in the old social system, but have emerged on the socialist road, guided by communist ideas. After seeing them, don't you feel honored to be born in this era? Don't you want to follow these people and catch up with them? Don't you want your brothers and sisters to be like them? You will believe that such people will surely defeat the dark forces in the world, you will therefore love the society and the socialist system that gave birth to them, and resolutely fight for it. "The Young Guard" creates a standard for being a person in the present world, that is, a standard of light and happiness. It leaves behind not only an example of being a person during the war, but a standard of being a person forever. I hope that Chinese youth will remember Oleg and Lyuba, we will learn from their patriotism and heroism, and learn from them to become a glorious person.

　　It is said that the actor Buluzzo, who played Chulenin, was a soldier who pursued and annihilated the German invaders on the front line, and the actress who played Ulia? She was also a member of the Kuban guerrillas, and this film was shot in Krasnodon. The people who created the heroes also created a heroic cause in literature and art. Literature and art in the Soviet Union have become so closely connected with reality. Their writers and artists, by doing this, are worthy of standing in front of the tombs of millions of heroic figures of the Krasnodon youth heroes. Such heroic literature and art should appear in a society, this is a great harvest of socialist realism. A truly revolutionary realist, if he does not serve the current struggle and does not think about how to make the struggle victorious, he cannot breathe with the people, and he combines with the people, precisely in the midst of the fiery struggle, you breathe together with them through difficulties and victories. At the same time, "The Young Guard" also tells us how to express positive heroes, they are not naturalistic, but indicate tomorrow, the future, infinite ideals and hopes. In our Chinese struggle, in prisons and on the front lines, there are not only such heroes, but also people who are advancing, walking in front, and carrying the light of the future among the heroes. Our literary and art workers can learn a lot from "The Young Guard," but they can also learn nothing. First and foremost, it still depends on your relationship with the reality struggle, the depth, and you, deciding your own creative path.

　　We should thank the Soviet Union for its achievements in creating new people and new literature and art, and thank the work of Comrades Fadeyev and Gerasimov. This achievement that appears before us is not only Soviet, but worldwide.

　　看了电影“青年近卫军”以后
    刘白羽
    看了法捷耶夫同志原著、格拉西莫夫同志编导的“青年近卫军”以后，我觉得我自己从思想到感情却被提高起来。我觉得这是在世界上以苏联为首的进步人类的胜利，是斗争的胜利，也是文学艺术的胜利。最近我脑子里常常在想一个问题，就是世界的文学艺术，在苏德战争中，向前大大提高一步，不是一般的一步，而且是划时代的一步。因为文学艺术，作为人民斗争武器，为政治斗争服务，从来不能象在苏德战争中结合得那样密切，那样推动斗争，那样有力、那样光辉、那样丰富。
    当我看到为苏联（也为全世界）英勇尽忠，最后被法西斯捕获的，以奥列格、刘巴、邬丽亚、邱列宁为首的青年近卫军同志们英勇、慷慨走向刑场时，我忍不住我的热泪，我难过吗？不，我庄严而欢快的看到世界上产生了这样真正优秀的人物，这是共产主义的胜利。这种人是英勇的，也是美丽的，是世界上最完整、理想的人，这种人在斗争中象火焰一样单纯、勇猛，这种人在旧社会制度中是不可能产生，而在社会主义道路上，按着共产主义思想的指导而出现了。看了他们，你不觉得你生在这一时代光荣吗？你不想向这些人走去，跟上他们吗？你不想你的兄弟姊妹象他们一样吗？你会相信这样人一定会战胜世界上黑暗势力，你会因而爱所生他的社会与社会主义制度，而且坚决为它斗争。“青年近卫军”给现世界制造出一个人的标准、也就是光明与幸福的标准，它留下的不仅是战时做一个人的榜样，而是永远做一个人的标准。我希望中国青年记着奥列格、刘巴，我们学习他们爱国主义的英雄主义，学习他们成为一个光辉的人。
    据说：演邱列宁的演员布鲁佐，就是一个火线上追歼德寇的战士，饰邬丽亚的呢？也是库班游击队的一员，而这片子就是在克拉斯诺顿拍制的，创造英雄的人物又创造了文艺上的英雄事业，文艺在苏联已经与现实如此密切相联。他们的作家、艺术工作者，这样做，是无愧于站在克拉斯诺顿青年英雄墓前的，百万英雄人物的社会里应该出现这样英雄的文艺，这是社会主义现实主义伟大收获。一个真正革命的现实主义者，不为当前斗争而服务，不思考如何使斗争胜利，他是不能与人民呼吸相通的，和人民结合，正是在火热斗争中结合，你和他们共同呼吸着困难与胜利。同时“青年近卫军”也告诉我们如何表现正面的英雄，他们不是自然主义的，而是指示着明天，未来前途，无限理想与希望的。在我们中国的斗争中，在监牢里、火线上，不但有这样英雄，而且英雄们中间也存在着前进的，走到前面，带着未来光芒的人物。我们文学艺术工作者，从“青年近卫军”可以学习得很丰富的东西，但也可以什么都学不到，首先的首先，还决定于你和现实斗争的关系、深度，你，决定你自己创作的道路。
    我们应该感谢苏联在创造新的人与新的文艺的成就，感谢法捷耶夫、格拉西莫夫同志的工作，这种成就在我们面前出现，已不仅仅是苏联的，而是全世界的了。
