    Labor Protection for Minors in the Soviet Union
    Soviet law prohibits the employment of minors under the age of fourteen. Minors aged fourteen to sixteen may be employed only in exceptional circumstances and with the permission of trade union organizations. Particularly arduous and physically harmful work is not permitted for persons under the age of eighteen.

    There are specific limits to the weight that minors can carry.

    The working day for minors under the age of sixteen is set at four hours, and they are not permitted to work overtime or night shifts. For apprentices aged fourteen to sixteen, whether receiving individual or group training, the working day is set at six hours during their training period and subsequent work in the enterprise.

    Minors under the age of eighteen who temporarily lose their ability to work receive 80% of their wages as a subsidy if they are trade union members and have worked continuously in an enterprise or institution for more than two years, and 60% of their wages if they have worked for less than two years; non-trade union members receive 50% of their wages as a subsidy.

    苏联未成年者的劳动保护
    苏联的法律是禁止雇用十四岁以下的未成年者的。十四岁至十六岁的未成年者，只是在例外情况下得职工会组织的许可后才可以雇用。特别苛重与有伤身体的工作，不允许雇用未满十八岁的人从事。
    未成年者负重，有一定限度的规定。
    十六岁以下的未成年者，工作日规定为四小时，并不允许作额外的夜工。十四岁至十六岁的学徒，无论受个别训练或整班训练，在其受训期间及随后在企业中工作时，工作日均规定为六小时。
    不及十八岁的未成年者，在暂时丧失工作能力时，倘系工会会员，并连续在某一企业或机关工作两年以上，得领工资的百分之八十作为补助费，不及两年者，得领工资的百分之六十作为补助费；非工会会员，领工资的百分之五十作为补助费。
