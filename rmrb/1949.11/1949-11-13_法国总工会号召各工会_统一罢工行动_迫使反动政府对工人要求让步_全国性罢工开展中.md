Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 12th: TASS, Paris, December 10th: Due to the rising cost of living faced by the French working people and the Pideault reactionary government's stubborn refusal to meet their fundamental demands, the strike movement is developing throughout the country. The strike by textile workers and staff in Calais, northern France, continues. At the initiative of the Communist parliamentarians, the Calais City Council decided to donate 10 million francs as a strike relief fund. Metalworkers in Calais also organized strikes lasting from one hour to twenty-four hours. On the 8th of this month, textile workers near Roanne in the department of Loire and Thizy in the department of Rhône, central France, declared a twenty-four-hour strike, with 90% to 100% of textile workers participating. Through joint action, the strikers have won an initial victory, forcing the owners of four textile factories to pay each worker a subsidy of 3,000 francs.

The Executive Bureau of the French General Confederation of Labor issued a statement saying: "Only bold, resolute, and unified action by all working people can force the government to concede to the legitimate demands of the workers." The statement also said: The Executive Bureau of the General Confederation of Labor, in accordance with the unanimous desire of the working people, once again openly calls on the French Confederation of Christian Workers, the General Confederation of Executives and Technical Staff, and the Workers' Force and other trade unions to jointly "establish a national unified action committee." The communiqué concluded by saying to all workers: "Struggle, to transform the unity of action you have established in various enterprises into unity of action on a national scale."

    统一罢工行动
    迫使反动政府对工人要求让步
    全国性罢工开展中
    【新华社北京十二日电】塔斯社巴黎十日讯：由于法国劳动人民面临生活费用的增涨和皮杜尔反动政府固执地不肯满足他们的根本要求，罢工运动正在全国开展中。法国北部加莱的纺织工人和职员的罢工，仍在坚持中。在共产党众议员的发起下，加莱市议会决定捐助一千万法郎作为罢工援助基金。加莱金属工人也组织了一小时至二十四小时的罢工。本月八日，法国中部罗亚尔省的罗安和罗尼省的蒂齐两城附近的纺织工人，曾宣告罢工二十四小时，百分之九十至百分之百的纺织工人参加罢工。罢工者借联合行动，已赢得初步胜利，迫使四家纺织工厂的老板付给每一工人三千法郎的津贴。
    法国总工会执行局特发表公告称：“只有所有劳动人民大胆、坚决和统一的行动，才能迫使政府对工人的合法要求让步。”公告又称：总工会执行局遵照劳动人民的一致愿望，再度公开呼吁基督教工人联盟、雇员和技术人员联合总会、工人力量等工会共同“建立全国统一行动委员会”。公报在结语中对所有劳动者称：“奋斗，使你们在各企业中建立的行动统一变成全国规模的行动统一。”
