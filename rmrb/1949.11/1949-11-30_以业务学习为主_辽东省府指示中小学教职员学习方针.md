Focusing on Professional Development
   Liaoning Provincial Government Directs Learning Guidelines for Primary and Secondary School Teachers and Staff
    [Our Northeast Correspondent] The Liaoning Provincial People's Government recently issued clear instructions regarding the learning guidelines for primary and secondary school teachers and staff. The instructions stated that the organization and leadership of teachers and staff in their studies should currently focus on professional development, combining it with the study of politics. Teachers should learn what they teach; they should study thoroughly and master the material before teaching students. The Provincial Government stipulates that all middle school teachers of all subjects should study the book "The Ideological and Political Education of Soviet Students" and select parts closely related to their teaching subjects for detailed study. Chinese language teachers may also study Chairman Mao's Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art, based on their specific situations, or select and read basic knowledge of literature (written by Ye Yiqun) and a new literary tutorial (translated by Ye Yiqun). At the same time, they should select and read one or two famous works within half a year (such as *Changes in Li Village*, *Corrosion*, *Midnight*, etc.). History teachers should study the Introduction to the Chinese History Tutorial (written by Wu Yuzhang) or select and read one or two articles from the Collection of Chinese Historical Essays, such as Outline for the Study of Chinese History (by Lü Zhenyu), etc. Teachers of political common sense should study A Brief History of Social Development (Liberation Press) or Political Economy (Leontiev). Comrades with stronger self-study abilities can also refer to Introduction to the Textbook of Political Economy (Wang Xuewen, published in People's Daily). Natural science teachers should study Talks on Natural Science (Roktin), On the State of the Biological World (Lysenko), and select and read *Man and Mountain* (Ilyin) or *How Man Became a Giant* (Ilyin). In addition, *Northeast Education* is designated as one of the regular professional development materials.
    For primary school teachers and staff, the Provincial Government stipulates that the basic requirement for professional development is to be proficient in the content of teaching materials and to study teaching methods, using textbooks as the basic learning materials. Those with higher cultural and professional levels can additionally study *Teaching Methods of Natural Science for Primary Schools* and *Introduction to Soviet Education*, etc. Teachers with lower cultural levels should also make up for their cultural deficiencies. For political studies, the Provincial Government requires primary school teachers and staff to regularly read the *Liaodong Masses Daily* and select important editorials related to the central work of the time and locality as study materials. Those with higher levels of education can systematically study the History of Social Development. Currently, time should be set aside to study the documents of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.
    The learning methods emphasize group collective self-study combined with subject-specific research groups, exchanging reading experiences and teaching experiences, teachers of the same subject and grade jointly studying teaching materials and teaching methods, and larger discussion meetings can be held when necessary. Experts can be invited or comrades among the teachers who understand the issues better can give enlightening reports, launch discussions, and make clear conclusions in a timely manner. For primary school teachers in rural areas with scattered conditions, the method of joint learning areas can be implemented, with several schools jointly establishing learning groups, selecting enthusiastic learners as group leaders, emphasizing individual self-study at ordinary times, and concentrating on discussions regularly.

　　以业务学习为主
  　辽东省府指示中小学教职员学习方针
    【本报东北通讯】辽东省人民政府近对中小学教职员的学习方针，作了明确指示。指示写道，组织与领导教职员学习，目前应以业务学习为主，结合业务，学习政治，实行教什么、学什么，先生学好学通，再去教学生。省府规定中学各科教员应一律学习“苏联学生的思想政治教育”一书，并选择与自己所教学科密切有关的部分加以详细研究。国文教员并可按不同情况分别研究毛主席文艺座谈会讲话，或选读文学的基础知识（叶以群著）及新文学教程（叶以群译），同时在半年内选读名著一、二种（如李家庄的变迁、腐蚀、子夜等）。历史教员研究中国历史教程绪论（吴玉章著），或在中国历史论集内选读一、二篇文章，如中国历史研究提纲（吕振羽）等。政治常识教员研究社会发展简史（解放社），或政治经济学（列昂节夫），自修能力较强的同志，还可参看政治经济学教程绪论（王学文，刊人民日报）。自然科学教员研究自然科学讲话（罗克汀），论生物界现状（李森科），并选读人和山（伊林）或人怎样变成巨人（伊林）。此外并指定东北教育为经常的业务学习材料之一。
    小学教职员，省府规定业务学习的基本要求是熟练教材内容，并研究教学方法，应以课本为基本学习材料。文化及业务水平较高的可另学小学自然常识教学法及苏联教育介绍等。文化水平低的教师还应补习文化。政治学习，省府要求小学教职员经常读辽东大众报，并选择与当时当地中心工作有关的重要社论作为研究材料。文化程度较高的可有系统地学习社会发展史。在目前应抽出时间学习人民政协文件。
    学习方法，强调分组集体自学与各科研究研究小组结合，交换读书心得及教学经验，同科同级教员共同研究教材及教学法，必要时可以召开较大的讨论会。并可请专人或由教员中理解问题较好的同志作启发报告，展开讨论，及时作出明确的结论。在农村分散条件下的小学教员，可实行联学区的办法，几个学校联合建立学习小组，选出热心学习的同志为小组长，平时强调个人自学，定期集中讨论。
