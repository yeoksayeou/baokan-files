Every Cadre Should Master Their Profession
　　Northeast Railway Bureau
　　Examines Cadre Competence
　　Twenty-Five Branch Bureau Directors and Section Chiefs Participate, Eight Score Full Marks, Three Fail

　　[Harbin News] The Northeast Railway Bureau held its first examination of cadres on technical management regulations for the entire railway system on October 15th, 17th, and 18th in the hall of the Railway Culture Palace. The examination was conducted orally. The examination committee was composed of Director-General Yu Guangsheng and heads of various departments, with four cadres being examined each time. During the examination, car operations were examined first, with questions being asked of the examinees in turn. After the car operations questions were completed, then locomotive operations were examined, followed by civil engineering and telecommunications. In about an hour or so, the extent of the four cadres' understanding of technical regulations was clearly assessed. After the four cadres were examined, another four came in; in three days, a total of twenty-five people were examined, including eight at the branch bureau director level, seven at the car operations section chief level, four at the telecommunications section chief level, five at the civil engineering section chief level, and one special-class stationmaster.

　　The results of the examination showed that eight people scored full marks, eleven scored eighty points, four scored sixty points, and three failed. Among the branch bureau director-level cadres, Comrades Wang Zhibai and Hu Jingxiang, the directors of the Changchun and Mudanjiang branch bureaus, respectively, performed well. Among the car operations section chief-level cadres, Zhang Chong, the deputy director of the Harbin Railway Bureau's car operations section, performed the best, answering fluently and very skillfully. Wang Shuen, the director of the Shenyang Railway Bureau's car operations section, Yang Guohui, the director of the Harbin Railway Bureau's car operations section, and Yue Lie, the stationmaster of Harbin Station, all scored full marks. In the civil engineering department, Lin Dun, the deputy director of the Harbin Railway Bureau's civil engineering section, and Liu Handong, the director of the Shenyang Railway Bureau's civil engineering section, performed the best, and Xing Wenying of the Qiqihar Railway Bureau also scored full marks.

　　The examination results revealed that the cadres of the Jilin Railway Bureau, the Jinzhou Railway Bureau, and the Jiamusi Branch Bureau had weaker learning. The worst case was Comrade Deng Weikang, the director of the civil engineering section of the Jilin Railway Bureau. When asked, "What parts does a turnout consist of?" he replied, "I don't know!" When asked again, "Can you draw a picture of a turnout for everyone to see?" he replied, "I can't draw!" When asked how to protect a blocking works, he gave an irrelevant answer after a long time. At that time, an examination committee member asked this question: "Comrade Deng, have you read the technical regulations even once?" He replied, "I haven't read it even once!" Another examination committee member said, "Comrade Deng, you don't have a copy of the technical regulations, do you? Let us send you one." He replied: I have one at home.

　　Based on the above results, the Director-General encouraged and commended those who performed well in the examination, but at the same time cautioned them not to be complacent. For those who passed, he pointed out that merely passing was far from sufficient for a responsible cadre. For those who failed, especially for Director Deng Weikang, he gave severe criticism and set a deadline of two months for a re-examination. If he failed again, he would have to be dismissed. Other cadres who were absent for some reason should take a make-up examination on a regular basis. After the examination, one of the branch bureau directors who failed scratched his head and said: "You can't get away with not studying!"

　　每个干部都应精通业务
  　东北铁路总局
  　考试干部业务
    分局局长处长廿五人参加八名考得满分三名不及格
    【哈尔滨讯】东北铁路总局于十月十五、十七、十八三天，在铁路文化馆的大厅里举行全路第一次干部技术管理规程的考试。考试采用口试。以余光生总局长及各部负责人组成考试委员会，每次考试四个干部。考试时，先考车务，轮流向被考试者提问题。车务问完了，接着就问机务，以至工务、电务。大约一个多钟头，四位干部对技术规程的了解程度，就测验清楚了。四位干部考完了，再来四位；三天之内，一共考试了二十五人，内有分局局长级八人，车务处长级七人，电务处长级四人，工务处长级五人，特等站长一人。
    考试结果，得满点的八名，八十分的十一名，六十分的四名，不及格的三名。分局长级干部中，长春、牡丹江分局长王知白、胡景祥同志的成绩均好，车务处长级干部中，以哈局车务处副处长张宠为最好，应对如流，非常熟练。沈局车务处长王树恩、哈局车务处长杨国辉、哈尔滨站长岳烈等同志均得满分。工务部门哈局工务副处长林暾、沈局工务处长刘汉东考得最好，齐局邢文英亦得满分。
    考试结果暴露了吉局、锦局、佳木斯分局干部学习较差。最糟糕的，要算吉局工务处长邓维康同志。问他：“道叉由几部组成？”答复是“不知道！”，再问“你能画道叉的样子给大家看看？”答复是“不会画！”如再问遮断工事掩护方法如何？答复半天，文不对题。当时有一位考试委员提了这样问题：“邓同志，技术规程你看了一遍没有？”答复是“没有看过一遍！”另一位考试委员说：“邓同志，你没有技术规程吧？让我们送你一本。”他答复：家里有。
    根据以上结果，总局长对考试成绩优良者予以鼓励表扬，但同时告诫切不可自满；对及格者则指出仅仅及格对一个负责干部来说，是非常不够的，对不及格者，特别对邓维康处长，则严厉批评，限定两个月以后再来考试，如再不及格，只得撤职。其他因故未到的干部应定期补试。考试以后，有一位不及格的分局长搔搔他的头顶说：“不学不行啦！”
