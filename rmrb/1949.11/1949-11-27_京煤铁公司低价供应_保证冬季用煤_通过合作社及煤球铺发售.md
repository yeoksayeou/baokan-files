[Beijing News] Beijing Coal and Iron Company is supplying a large amount of low-priced coal to the broad masses of working people in Beijing through cooperatives and coal brick shops. In order to ensure that members' winter coal consumption is not affected by market price fluctuations and that they can use dry coal bricks, the company and the Municipal Cooperative General Society will supply a total of 28,000 tons of lump coal to members from November this year to February next year. The street, factory, government office, and school cooperative coal brick factories organized by the Cooperative General Society (more than 40 have been established) are stepping up their production. The preferential measures for cooperatives by the Coal and Iron Company are: batch delivery with payment in installments, lump coal sold on seven days credit is 4% lower than the general wholesale price; cash transactions are 5% preferential; other types of coal are all cash transactions with a 5% discount. At the same time, in order to enable members to burn dry coal bricks, it was decided that 28,000 tons of coal should be taken clear before the end of December this year. Therefore, in addition to implementing the whole car delivery method, the amount of coal taken each time has been relaxed from 20 tons to 50 tons. Most of the 250,000 members in Beijing will be able to burn coal that is a quarter cheaper than the market price this winter (the current market price of coal bricks is 6,000 yuan per hundred jin, and the cooperative price is 4,500 yuan to 5,000 yuan). In order to directly supply citizens with coal and reduce intermediate exploitation, the company began signing contracts with Beijing coal brick shops on the 25th of this month (84 have been signed) to handle retail sales, supply raw materials to coal brick shops at listed prices, and stipulate the retail price of coal bricks. Coal bricks are priced at the company's current Jia Mo brand price plus 10%, and lump coal is priced at the current Jia Kuai brand price plus 20%. For example, if the Jia Mo brand price on the 25th is 80,000 yuan per ton, the company's retail price of coal bricks is 4,400 yuan per jin, which is 1,600 yuan lower than the market price; the Jia Kuai brand price is 94,000 yuan per ton, and the company's retail price is 5,650 yuan per hundred jin, which is 3,350 yuan lower than the market price. At the same time, the quality of coal bricks is determined as: 40% soil mixed with Te Mo, 30% soil mixed with Jia Mo, and 20% soil mixed with Yi Mo, and it is guaranteed to be 80% dry. Each retail coal brick shop displays a sign at the entrance every day, and citizens can purchase based on their household registration form. Families with four or fewer people are calculated as four people, and families with more than four people are calculated according to the number of people, with each person calculated at four jin per day, and each purchase is allowed for five days of coal.
