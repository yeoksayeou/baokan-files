Timely Prevention and Control
    Strict Blockade
    Plague in Northern Chahar Stopped Spreading
    Zhangjiakou City Completes Injections, Large-Scale Rat Catching to Commence

[Our Newspaper, Chahar League, 11th Dispatch] Reporter’s comprehensive report: Since the discovery of plague in the Zuyindi Administrative Region of Chahar League and Kangbao County of Chahar Province in late October, the local government has mobilized the masses to implement strict blockades and isolation. After personnel from the Central Anti-Epidemic Team rushed to the epidemic area to carry out anti-epidemic injections and disinfection, the plague has stopped spreading. According to preliminary investigations, the plague actually occurred in mid-July, lasting four months and affecting eight villages, resulting in 62 deaths. It initially occurred in Qianyinkou Village in the grassland, where three people died of bubonic plague. Local herders lacked hygiene knowledge and did not pay attention. Consequently, it spread to Chahanbengbeng Village, with deaths starting on August 21. In early October, the bubonic plague turned into pneumonic plague, and the death toll increased further, reaching six people in a single day, totaling 34 deaths by the 16th. Residents panicked and fled in all directions, which led to the spread to Shenwanqingyingzi, where six people died; Beishachengzi, where seven people died; Lizhandi Village, where three people died; and Nanjinggou, where one person died. Furthermore, a doctor from Longwang Temple who treated patients in Chahanbengbeng was infected, and his entire family of five and a friend were also infected and died. The Central People's Government received a report at the end of October and immediately dispatched medical personnel to form an anti-epidemic team to rush to the epidemic area. On October 26, it was confirmed as pneumonic plague, and village-by-village blockades were implemented, along with isolating those who had been in contact with infected individuals. Due to the lack of medicine and equipment, most of the sickrooms were burned down (the government provided the families of the deceased with clothing and compensated them for their losses). At the same time, anti-epidemic injections were given in the epidemic villages, thus preventing the spread of the epidemic. Since the 1st of this month, no plague patients have been found in any village. Currently, the second and third teams of the Central Anti-Epidemic Team have arrived in the epidemic area to work. Based on the Northeast and Inner Mongolia Anti-Epidemic Teams, which have three years of anti-epidemic experience, and with the help and guidance of the Soviet Anti-Epidemic Team, various anti-epidemic tasks are being arranged, including investigating the transmission process, dissecting corpses, and examining rat fleas.

[Our Newspaper, Zhangjiakou, 11th Dispatch] As of the 10th, with the joint efforts of Chinese and Soviet anti-epidemic personnel, more than 130,000 of Zhangjiakou's 162,000 residents have been injected with live attenuated plague vaccine, except for those unsuitable for injection. Thus, the injection work for the entire population of Zhangjiakou City has come to an end. Under the guidance of Soviet animal expert Kamnev, Zhangjiakou's rat-catching and flea-killing work will be rapidly launched. A rat-catching team composed of 122 people from North China Medical University, the First Anti-Epidemic Team of China, and Zhangjiakou middle school students, divided into ten groups, went deep into various districts on the 9th and 10th, checking and blocking rat holes in every household, and publicizing the importance of rat-catching and flea-killing. According to statistics, a total of 2,897 houses have been inspected in the past two days, and 4,033 rat holes have been found. Rat catching will begin on the 12th. Jimiafangzi, an epidemic village, is also using sticky flea paper to trap fleas (made by coating paper with a mixed solution of soybean oil, sesame oil, and rosin). The Chinese and Soviet anti-epidemic teams are currently rushing to manufacture rat poison. According to Soviet animal expert Kamnev, rat-catching and flea-killing work is a regular, mass-based effort. A simple and easy method is to use mechanical rat traps. When using rat poison, it is easy to have accidents if there is no poison prevention equipment. Seasonally, only domestic rats can be caught now; wild rats have already hibernated for the winter.

    防治及时
    封锁严密
    察北鼠疫停止蔓延
    张市注射完毕将大规模捕鼠
    【本报察盟十一日专电】记者综合报导：察哈尔盟租银地行政区及察哈尔省康保县自十月下旬发现鼠疫以来，经当地政府动员群众实行严密封锁、隔离，中央防疫队人员赶至疫区进行防疫注射消毒等项工作后，鼠疫已停止蔓延。据初步调查，此次鼠疫七月中旬即已发生，到现在已四个月，波及八个村庄，死亡六十二人，最初发生在草地前音口村，三人患腺鼠疫死亡。当地牧民缺乏卫生常识，并未注意。遂传至察汉崩崩村，八月二十一日开始死亡，十月初由腺鼠疫转为肺鼠疫，死亡人数更多，有一日即达六人，至十六日止共死三十四人。居民恐慌，四散逃亡，遂传至沈万清营子，死六人；北沙城子死七人；李占地村死三人；南景沟死一人。又有龙王庙医生在察汉崩崩治病感染，全家五人和他的一个朋友都受传染，病死。中央人民政府于十月底接到报告，即抽调医务人员组成防疫队赶来疫区。十月二十六日证实为肺鼠疫，遂实行村村封锁及隔离接触过患病者的人。由于医药及器材的缺少，把病室大部焚烧（由政府发给死者家属被服，赔偿他们的损失。）同时又在疫村注射防疫针，遂阻止了疫病蔓延。从本月一日起各村未发现鼠疫患者。现中央防疫队二、三中队已至疫区工作，由有三年防疫经验的东北及内蒙防疫队为基础组成，在苏联防疫队的帮助与指导下布置各项防疫工作，调查传染经过，及解剖尸体、鼠蚤等工作。
    【本报张家口十一日专电】截至十日止，在中苏防疫人员共同努力下，张市十六万二千人口中，除部分不适于注射者外，已有十三万余人注射鼠疫生菌疫苗。至此张市全人口的注射工作宣告结束。在苏联动物专家卡姆聂夫的指导下，张市的捕鼠灭蚤工作即将迅速展开。由华北医大、中防一中队、张中学生等一百二十二人组成的捕鼠队分十个组，九、十两日深入各区，挨户检查与堵塞鼠洞，并宣传捕鼠灭蚤的重要性。据统计，两天来共检查了二八九七座房子，查出四零三三个鼠洞。十二日起开始捕鼠。疫村姬家房子并用粘蚤纸捉跳蚤（制法是把豆油、麻油、松香的混合溶液涂在纸上）。中苏防疫队现正赶造毒鼠药。十五日起开始用药毒鼠。据苏动物专家卡姆聂夫向记者表示：捕鼠灭蚤工作系一经常性群众性的工作。简而易行的办法是用器械捕鼠。使用毒鼠药时，如没有防毒设备，容易出危险。按季节现在只能捕家鼠，入冬地冻，野鼠已冬眠。
