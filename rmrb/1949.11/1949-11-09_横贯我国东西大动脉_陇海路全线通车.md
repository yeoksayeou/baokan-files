Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 8th. The Longhai Railway, stretching 1,226 kilometers from Lianyungang in the east to Baoji in the west, has been fully opened to traffic on the 7th, thanks to the timely restoration of the section between Luoyang and Tongguan. The Longhai Railway traverses the four provinces of Jiangsu, Henan, Shaanxi, and Gansu, serving as a major east-west artery of our country. Construction began in 1906, with the original intention of making Lanzhou, the capital of Gansu Province, its terminus. However, it was never fully completed in the past 43 years. The restored section from Tongguan to Luoyang this time was started simultaneously from both the east and west ends two months ago. The eastern section, consisting of 153 kilometers of engineering work from Luoyang to Daying Station west of Shan County, was restored by the Railway Engineering Corps and the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau. The western section, consisting of 84 kilometers of engineering work from Tongguan to Daying, was restored by the Xi'an Branch of the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau. Since the commencement of work, all workers, engineers, and staff have been racing against time, regardless of wind and rain, and overcoming various difficulties such as the shortage of materials. In particular, the vast number of peasants in the counties along the railway line in western Henan and central Shaanxi actively transported sleepers and logs, and participated in the work of repairing the roadbed. Therefore, although construction could not be carried out for a quarter of the time due to rain in the past two months, it was still completed as scheduled according to the plan.

　　横贯我国东西大动脉
  　陇海路全线通车
    【新华社西安八日电】陇海铁路东起连云港、西起宝鸡间一千二百二十六公里的铁路线，由于洛阳至潼关间线路的如期修复，已于七日全线通车。陇海铁路横贯苏、豫、陕、甘四省，为我国横贯东西的大动脉，兴筑于一九零六年，原拟以甘肃省会兰州为终点。但四十三年来迄未全线修竣。这次修复的潼关至洛阳一段，是在两个月前分东西两段同时动工的。东段由洛阳至陕县以西的大营车站一百五十三公里的工程，由铁道兵团和郑州铁路局修复，西段潼关至大营八十四公里的工程，由郑州路局西安分局修复。兴工以来，全体工人、工程师和职员不避风雨地日夜抢修和克服器材缺乏等种种困难，特别是豫西和关中沿铁路线各县广大农民积极运送枕木圆木，和参加修路基的工作，因此，两个月中虽然有四分之一的时间因雨不能施工，但仍按照预定计划如期完成。
