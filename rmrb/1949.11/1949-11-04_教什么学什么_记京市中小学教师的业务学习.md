Teaching What One Learns
    —A Record of Professional Development for Teachers in Beijing’s Primary and Secondary Schools
    Bai Sheng

The primary and secondary school teachers in Beijing are enthusiastically engaged in professional development.

Since the last semester, they have successively established organizations for professional development, such as the Chinese Language, History, and Music professional development associations in middle schools, and the professional development groups organized by district in primary schools. At the beginning of this semester, the unified professional development committee of the Beijing Primary and Secondary School Education Union was officially established. Among them, middle school subjects include eight subjects such as Chinese Language, History, Geography, Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry, Music, Art and Labor, and Physical Education. The total number of teachers participating in the study reached more than 1,700, accounting for 85% of all middle school teachers. In primary schools, study groups have been established by district, and a primary school professional development committee is being organized to take charge of leadership.

The Middle School Professional Development Committee has formulated a study plan for this semester. Based on the Marxist-Leninist stand, viewpoints, and methods, ideological and political education is to be integrated into the teaching of various subjects. For example, in Chinese Language and History classes, students should be cultivated to love the motherland, the people, labor, science, and public property, and struggle against feudal, comprador, and fascist ideas. In science courses, attention should be paid to cultivating students' dialectical materialist worldview, removing outdated, reactionary, and unrealistic materials, and enriching the content necessary for industrial and agricultural and national defense construction.

They put forward the slogan of "teaching what one learns," studying the textbooks and reference books of their respective subjects, closely combining them with teaching work, and using "Ideological and Political Education for Soviet Students" as a reference material for general study. In terms of learning methods, they focus on self-study and intensive reading, combined with organizing professional development groups, formulating specific teaching plans and schedules, implementing demonstration teaching, mutual observation, and constantly summarizing experience to improve teaching. At the same time, the study groups of each subject also jointly form a unified professional development organization in each school to strengthen the connection between the teaching of various subjects so that they can cooperate with each other.

In the study of various subjects, they have raised many questions, such as how to teach vernacular Chinese in the Chinese Language subject; how to combine current affairs teaching and ideological education in the history curriculum, and even how to use historical materials in the History subject; how to revise the current teaching materials with new viewpoints and new materials in the Geography subject; these issues have been widely discussed in the professional development groups of various schools.

The current direction of study is clear, but the question is how to formulate specific study plans for each subject under the existing guidelines, and how to implement them in the study. Because there are generally very few people with experience in leading learning in various schools, and although the heads of the professional development groups in various schools are enthusiastic, responsible, and professionally strong, they lack experience in leading learning, so some groups may form self-flow. Most teachers study to improve their work, but some teachers have some concerns because their thinking has not been completely opened up, and they are unwilling to expose their weaknesses and are not accustomed to listening to each other's classes and criticizing each other. These are all things that need to be gradually improved and overcome.

　　教什么学什么
    ——记京市中小学教师的业务学习
    柏生
    北京的中小学教师们正热烈地进行业务学习。
    从上学期起，他们已陆续有了业务学习的组织，如中学的国文、历史、音乐等业务学习会的成立，小学中以区为单位组织的业务学习小组。本学期开学时，北京市中小学教联统一的业务学习委员会已正式成立了起来。其中中学各科包括了国文、历史、地理、数学、理化、音乐、美劳、体育等八科。参加学习的教员总数达一千七百余人，占中学全体教员百分之八十五。小学方面则以区为单位建立了学习小组，同时正在组织小学的业务学习委员会负责领导。
    中学业务学委会已拟定了本学期学习计划。本着马列主义的立场、观点和方法，在各科教学中贯穿思想政治教育，如在国文、历史课中培养学生爱祖国、爱人民、爱劳动、爱科学、爱公共财物的公德，对封建的、买办的、法西斯主义的思想进行斗争。在理科课程中则注意培养学生辩证唯物的世界观，除去陈旧的、反动的、不联系实际的材料，充实为工业农业和国防建设所必需的内容。
    他们提出了“教什么学什么”的口号，学习本科的教本与参考书籍，与教课业务密切结合起来，并以“苏联学生的思想政治教育”作为普遍学习的参考材料。在学习方法上，他们以自学精读为主，结合组织业务学习小组，订教学具体计划和进度，实行示范教学，互相观摩，随时总结经验，改进教学。同时各科学习小组并联合组成各校的统一业务学习组织，加强各科教学的联系，使能互相配合。
    在各科学习中，他们提出来的问题很多，如国文科提出了怎样教白话文的问题；历史科提出了怎样在历史课程中结合时事教学和思想教育，以至怎样利用史科等；地理科提出了如何以新的观点和新的材料来编订目前的教材；这些问题都已普遍的在各校业务学习小组中展开了热烈的讨论。
    目前的学习方向是明确的，但问题却在这已有的方针下，各科如何制订具体的学习计划，和如何在学习中贯彻下去。因为各校有领导学习经验的人一般地说还很少，各校业务学习小组长虽然有热情肯负责，而且业务较强，但缺少领导学习经验，因此一部分小组会形成自流。大部分教师们的学习是为了搞好业务，但有一部分教员因思想没有完全打通而有一些顾虑，不愿暴露自己的弱点，不习惯于互相听课，互相批评，这些都是需要逐渐改进和克服的。
