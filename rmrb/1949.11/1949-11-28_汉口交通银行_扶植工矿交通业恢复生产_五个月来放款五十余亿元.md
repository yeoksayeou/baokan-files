　　Hankou Bank of Communications
  　Supports the Restoration of Production in Industry, Mining, and Transportation
    Five Months of Loans Amount to Over Five Billion Yuan
    [This newspaper reports] Since its opening after the liberation of Hankou, the Hankou Bank of Communications has worked hard to support the restoration and development of production in industry, mining, and transportation, with remarkable results. From June to the end of October, the bank approved loans totaling 5.58 billion yuan. If overdrafts used to help with circulating capital are included, the total amount of capital invested in production reaches over 8 billion yuan. After deducting recovered loans, the outstanding balance is 1.78 billion yuan. Borrowers include the state-owned E'nan Power Plant, Hanyang Oil Refinery, Hubei Machinery Factory, and the privately-owned First, Shenxin, Yuhua, and Zhenhuan four cotton mills, as well as the Hong'an Shipping Company, totaling 27 units. The loans have helped them overcome the difficulty of capital shortage. For example, the four private cotton mills received loans totaling 2.46 billion yuan successively after liberation, which helped them survive the season of expensive cotton and cheap yarn between June and July when new cotton had not yet been put on the market. Currently, the four cotton mills produce 220-230 bales of yarn per day, an increase of about 90 bales compared to the daily output in July. The privately-owned Fuhua Electric Flower Factory, which had been shut down for eight months before liberation, was able to resume production due to a mortgage loan of 5 million yuan from the bank. Now the number of workers has increased from a dozen to 130. Recently, the factory is planning to purchase additional machinery to expand production. After the privately-owned Hong'an Shipping Company obtained loans of 160 million yuan in installments, its ships, including the De'an, Hongyuan, Ruitai, E'an, and Yi'an, totaling more than 3,600 tons, which were berthed in Changsha, were quickly repaired, and the difficulties of fuel and staff salary payments were solved. The transportation capacity of the Wuhan-Shanghai, Wuhan-Changsha, and Wuhan-Yichang routes has also increased accordingly. After the state-owned Huaxin Cement Company obtained a long-term mortgage loan of more than 330 million yuan from the bank, it solved the problem of capital turnover, and the output in September increased to 14 times the output in May. Other companies such as Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company and E'nan Power Plant have also rapidly restored production due to loans.
