　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 25th. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions recently issued a notice regarding the dissolution of the China Labor Association. The notice points out: The China Labor Association recently held a representative meeting in Beijing, and all representatives unanimously passed an important resolution to dissolve the Labor Association organization. This decision is correct and timely. This is in line with the greatest interests of the Chinese working class.

　　The notice states: In the initial stage of its establishment, the China Labor Association utilized the very limited legal possibilities left by the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang to organize the masses of workers and carry out legitimate struggles to protect the daily interests of workers, which was permissible and correct. It played a considerable supporting role in the revolutionary struggle waged by the working class in the liberated areas. Since 1937, the Labor Association responded to the call of the Chinese Communist Party's anti-Japanese national united front, and since 1938, it took various possible steps to establish a joint organization with the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Trade Union. Later, it further jointly initiated and convened the Sixth National Labor Congress with the Federation of Trade Unions in the Liberated Areas, and after the Sixth Labor Congress, it joined the All-China Federation of Trade Unions as a group member. Now it has further dissolved its own organization and united organizationally with the various trade unions under the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. All these indicate that the China Labor Association has contributed to the cause of unity of the Chinese working class.

　　The notice states: The All-China Federation of Trade Unions expresses its condolences to the comrades of the China Labor Association who were arrested, wanted, and persecuted for carrying out revolutionary work.

　　The notice declares: The All-China Federation of Trade Unions expresses its infinite welcome to the decision of the representative meeting of the China Labor Association and accepts its proposal, and hereby makes the following decisions:

　　(1) Trade unions in all regions and industries should warmly welcome Labor Association members to join the trade union organizations in their respective enterprises, factories, institutions, and schools as members in accordance with the general regulations for receiving members. They should be treated equally with the original members, and there should be no discrimination of any kind.

　　(2) Trade unions in all regions and industries should report the original Labor Association cadres to us so that they can be absorbed to participate in various jobs in the relevant trade union organs. Whether in study or work, they must be treated the same as the original trade union cadres and given appropriate care as much as possible.

　　The notice finally requires that after receiving this notice, trade unions in all regions and industries should earnestly discuss it at cadre meetings, formulate specific implementation measures based on local conditions, and report the implementation situation to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions at any time.

　　全总通知各地各产业工会
    接受劳协结束决定，欢迎劳协会员参加工作。
    【新华社北京二十五日电】中华全国总工会近发出关于中国劳动协会结束的通知。该通知指出：中国劳动协会最近在北京召开代表会议，全体代表一致通过了结束劳动协会组织的重要决议。这个决定是正确的，适时宜的。这是符合于中国工人阶级最大利益的。
    该通知说：中国劳动协会在成立之初，利用国民党反动统治所留下的极少的合法可能，来组织工人群众，进行保护工人日常利益的合法斗争是可容许的，正确的，对于解放区工人阶级所进行的革命斗争起了相当的配合作用。劳动协会于一九三七年起即响应中国共产党抗日民族统一战线的号召，而于一九三八年起就采取与陕甘宁边区工会成立联合组织的各种可能步骤；后来进一步与解放区工会联合会共同发起召集第六次全国劳动大会，并在六次劳动大会后加入中华全国总工会为团体会员，现在又进一步结束自己的组织，与中华全国总工会所属各工会在组织上统一起来，这些都表明中国劳动协会是对中国工人阶级的统一事业有贡献的。
    该通知说：中华全国总工会对中国劳动协会因进行革命工作而遭受拘捕通辑摧残的同志表示慰问。
    该通知宣称：中华全国总工会对中国劳动协会代表会议的决定表示无限的欢迎并接受其提议，特作如下之决定：
    （一）各地区各产业工会对于劳协会员应按一般接收会员的规定热烈欢迎劳协会员参加其所在企业、工厂、机关、学校中的工会组织为会员。与原有会员一律平等待遇，不得有任何的歧视。
    （二）各地区各产业工会应将原来劳协干部报告我们，以便吸收他们参加相当工会机关中的各种工作，无论在学习或工作方面，必须与原来工会的干部同样待遇，并尽可能加以适当照顾。
    该通知最后要求各地区各产业工会接到这个通知后，在干部会上切实加以讨论，根据当地具体情况，拟出具体执行办法，并随时将执行的情形报告中华全国总工会。
