[Beijing News] The first Beijing Women's Congress, representing more than one million women in the capital, grandly opened at 2:00 p.m. yesterday (the 26th) in the auditorium of the Sino-French University. A total of 371 representatives attended. Beijing Mayor Nie Rongzhen, Honorary Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation He Xiangning, and Vice Chairman Li Dequan all attended and delivered speeches. Simone Bertrand, member of the Asian Women's Representatives Conference Preparatory Committee and director of the French Women's Association, and Asian Women's Congress Preparatory Committee members Amita Dawe from India, as well as Kim Gui-sun from Korea, Ho Duc Minh from Vietnam, Mahinafarouchi from Iran, and Heina A. Weilenk from the Netherlands, who attended the Asian Women's Congress, also participated in this grand event.

Chairman Zhang Xiaomei explained in her opening remarks that the purpose of the congress was to summarize the women's work in Beijing since liberation, exchange experiences from all aspects, determine the guiding principles and specific tasks of women's work in the city in the future, solve the organizational problems of the women masses, and adopt the charter and elect the first executive committee to officially establish the Beijing Democratic Women's Federation.

Revolutionary elder He Xiangning pointed out in her speech that the oppressed women have been liberated, first of all, thanks to Chairman Mao Zedong and Marshal Stalin. She earnestly encouraged everyone to follow the Common Program and strive to develop production and create sanitary conditions. Li Dequan delivered a congratulatory speech on behalf of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation. She said that the decision of the Second Beijing People's Representative Conference to liberate prostitutes was a glory for women, and she expressed the hope that this work could be promoted throughout the country. Then, Beijing Mayor Nie Rongzhen delivered a speech, instructing the guiding principles of women's work.

When the nine international friends stepped into the venue, the audience immediately burst into enthusiastic cheers. French representative Simone Bertrand and Indian representative Amita Dawe delivered speeches to the congress. When Amita Dawe mentioned in her speech that 30 Indian peasant (including women) leaders had recently been sentenced to death by the reactionary Nehru for fighting for freedom and liberation, the congress immediately expressed a serious protest to the reactionary Indian Nehru government.

Yu Xinqing and Zhang Xiuyan spoke, hoping that Beijing women would jointly participate in various undertakings to build the new capital, improve their political and cultural level, and strive to be various model workers in their respective positions.

Mayor Nie's Speech

[Beijing News] Mayor Nie Rongzhen spoke at the first Beijing Women's Congress. He warmly congratulated the success of the congress and put forward three points:

First, actively participate in production. In the city, although many women have participated in production and work in factories and other positions, a large number of housewives who do not engage in production still account for a large proportion in Beijing. We must organize the vast number of women in the city to the production front, jointly build our capital, transform the consumer city into a production city, thereby improving the economic status of women and realizing equal rights with men.

Second, the vast majority of women in the city still lack culture. Today, we already have every possibility to organize women to learn to read and write and improve women's culture. The government should also do its best to assist in this regard.

Third, the welfare undertakings of women must be valued. Article 48 of the Common Program of the CPPCC also clearly stipulates this: "Promote national sports. Promote health and medical undertakings, and pay attention to protecting the health of mothers, infants, and children." This time, the municipal government implemented the resolutions of the People's Representatives Conference, closed the brothels, on the one hand, to eliminate the barbaric feudal system, liberate the insulted and damaged women compatriots, and on the other hand, for the national health, for our future generations. Women's work is one of the important projects in the women's liberation movement, and childcare undertakings need to be developed vigorously. In this way, our future generations can receive good education, and our women compatriots can also be liberated from the burden of children, have time and energy to participate in production, and participate in national construction. And childcare work must be regarded as a great cause by women comrades. We must advocate respecting mothers and valuing the upbringing of future generations. Our revolution is not only for our own liberation, but more importantly for the happiness of future generations.

Simone Bertrand's Speech

[Beijing News] Simone Bertrand, member of the Asian and African Women's Issues Committee of the International Democratic Women's Federation and director of the French Women's Association, spoke at the Beijing Women's Congress.

First of all, she represented the International Democratic Women's Federation to pay tribute to the first Beijing Women's Congress in Beijing, the capital of the People's Republic of China, and to the women of Beijing. She said: The suffering working women of the world are anxiously seeing a terrible phenomenon of war preparation. They are infinitely grateful for the Chinese revolution. The Chinese revolution liberated hundreds of millions of men and women from the hands of the war-mongering American imperialism, deprived the imperialists of their bases of aggression, and made the world appear a great democratic country, a fortress of peace.

The International Democratic Women's Federation unites nearly 80 million women and mothers in 56 countries in Asia, Africa, Europe and the Americas, and is also an active force in the world peace and democracy camp.

In your liberation struggle, she is standing by your side, and she is standing together with the suffering women of Asia, and the women who are fighting for national independence and for the rights of them and their children.

Half of Asia has been liberated from the shackles of imperialism!

After the First World War, the Soviet Union appeared, followed by the appearance of the Mongolian People's Republic. After the Second World War, the People's Republic of China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam also appeared.

Under the shackles of colonial oppressors, hundreds of millions of Asian women and children are suffering from colonial wars and are fighting heroically. In a few days, their representatives will gather in your city. Beijing will see an event of historical significance in the lives of Asian women. This event symbolizes a new stage in the struggle of women on the Asian continent, which is moving towards complete liberation.

In this gathering of sisters from all over Asia and friends from other countries who are standing by their side, they will talk to each other, tell each other about their lives and struggles, and will fight side by side for happiness, security, freedom and stable work, as well as lasting peace against the executioners who kill their children; this is the meaning of the Asian Women's Congress.

Finally, she thanked the Chinese women, especially the women of Beijing, for their preparations for the Asian Women's Conference and many major material assistance.

Amita Dawe's Speech

[Beijing News] Amita Dawe, the Indian representative attending the Asian Women's Congress, spoke at the first Beijing Women's Congress. She said: "Our Indian men and women have always been watching the development of the struggle of our great neighbor—China, with infinite hope and drawing great inspiration from it. Our Indian men and women must strengthen the struggle against the traitorous Nehru government. Nehru, like Chiang Kai-shek in the past, fearing the high tide of the Indian democratic movement, attempted to put us on the bandwagon of the Anglo-American war provocateurs.

Yesterday I received a message: Thirty peasant (including women) leaders in our country were sentenced to death. This news made our blood boil! We know that the democratic people of the world will be as sad as we are, and share the feeling that this is our disaster. Dear Chinese sisters, I am very honored to tell you that we Indian women guarantee that we can inherit the excellent traditions of democratic women in the entire Asia, and even the world. We have the confidence of victory. Because we know that with you, the women and the entire people of China, with the World Democratic Women's Federation, together with us, we will continue to struggle for peace and democracy, and lead the women of the world. And on top of this, we have our great Soviet Union leading the democratic people of the world to fight to defeat imperialism."

Finally, she shouted: "Long live our people's leaders Comrade Stalin and Comrade Mao Zedong! Long live the unity of the great people of China and India! Long live the unity of the women of the world under the banner of the International Democratic Women's Federation!" (Attached picture)

　　各阶层各行业妇女空前大团结
  　京妇代会隆重开幕
    大会任务：交流经验，确定方针，成立北京市民主妇联会
    【北京讯】代表着首都一百余万妇女的北京市第一次妇女代表大会昨（二十六）日下午二时在中法大学礼堂隆重开幕。代表共三百七十一名。北京市市长聂荣臻，全国民主妇联名誉主席何香凝、副主席李德全等均莅会讲话。亚洲妇女代表会议筹备委员、法国妇女会理事西门·贝特朗，亚洲妇代会筹备委员印度代表阿米塔达维和出席亚洲妇代会的朝鲜代表金贵善，越南代表胡德明，伊朗代表玛海娜法鲁奇，荷兰代表海娜阿魏伦克等也参加这个盛典。
    主席张晓梅在开幕词中说明大会的目的，是要总结北京市解放以来的妇女工作，交流各方面的经验，确定今后全市妇女工作的方针和具体任务，解决妇女群众的组织问题，并且通过会章，选举第一届执行委员，正式成立北京市民主妇女联合会。
    革命老人何香凝在讲话中指出：被压迫的妇女获得了解放，首先要感谢毛泽东主席和斯大林大元帅，她谆谆勉励大家要遵循共同纲领，为发展生产事业和创造卫生条件而努力。李德全代表全国民主妇联向大会致贺。她说：北京市第二届各界人民代表会议决定解放妓女，是妇女们的光荣，她表示希望这件工作能推广到全国去。继由北京市聂荣臻市长讲话，指示了妇女工作方针。
    当九位国际友人步入会场时，全场立刻掀起了热烈的欢呼。法国代表西门·贝特朗和印度代表阿米塔维达并向大会发表演说，当阿米塔达维在演词中提到最近印度农民（包括妇女）领袖三十人为争取自由解放而被反动的尼赫鲁判处死刑时，大会当即表示向反动的印度尼赫鲁政府提出严重的抗议。
    余心情、张秀岩讲话：希望北京市妇女共同参加建设新首都的各种事业，提高政治文化水平，并在自己的岗位上争取作各种模范工作者。
　　聂市长讲话
    【北京讯】聂荣臻市长在北京市第一次妇女代表大会讲话，他热烈地庆贺大会的成功。并提出三点意见：
    首先是积极参加生产。在城市，固然在工厂中以及其他岗位上也有不少妇女参加了生产，参加了工作，但以北京来说，不事生产的家庭妇女仍然占着很大的数量。要把全市广大妇女组织到生产战线上来，共同来建设我们的首都，把消费城市变为生产城市，从而提高妇女的经济地位，实现与男子平等的权利。
    第二、全市妇女同胞缺乏文化仍是占着绝大的多数。今天，我们已经有了一切可能来组织妇女识字，提高妇女的文化，政府在这方面也当尽力给以协助。
    第三、是关于妇女的福利事业，必须加以重视。在政协共同纲领第四十八条对这个也有明文规定：“提倡国民体育。推广卫生医药事业，并注意保护母亲、婴儿和儿童的健康”，这次市府执行各界人民代表会议的决议，封闭妓院，一方面是消灭野蛮的封建制度，解放被侮辱与被损害的妇女同胞，一方面也是为了国民健康，为了我们的后代。妇女工作是妇女解放运动中的重要项目之一，托儿保育事业是需要用大力来发展的，这样作，我们的后代可以得到良好的教养，我们的妇女同胞也可以从孩子的负累中解放出来，有时间和精力来参加生产，参加国家的建设。而保育工作又必须妇女同志把它当作一种伟大的事业来作。我们要提倡尊重母亲，重视后代的抚养。我们革命，不仅是为了本身的解放，而且更重要的是为了后代的幸福。
　　西门·贝特朗讲话
    【北京讯】国际民主妇联亚菲妇女问题委员会委员法国妇女会理事西门·贝特朗在北京市妇女代表大会上讲话。
    首先，她代表国际民主妇女联合会向中华人民共和国的首都北京市第一次妇女代表大会致敬，向北京市妇女们致敬。她说：世界上受痛苦的劳动妇女们，正在焦急地看到一个可怕的战争的准备现象，她们对中国的革命无限感激，中国的革命从制造战争的美帝国主义的手中解放了几万万男人们和妇女们，剥夺了帝国主义者的手中的侵略基地，使世界上出现了一个伟大的民主国家，一个和平的堡垒。
    国际民主妇女联合会在亚洲菲洲欧洲和美洲团结了五十六个国家里将近八千万妇女们和母亲们，也是世界和平民主阵营中的积极力量。
    在你们解放斗争中，她是站在你们一边的，她更是和亚洲受痛苦妇女们，以及为民族独立为争取她们和她们孩子们的权利而斗争的妇女们站在一起。
    亚洲的一半已从帝国主义的枷锁下解放了！
    在第一次世界大战以后，出现了苏联，随后就是蒙古人民共和国的出现。在第二次世界大战以后，又出现了中华人民共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、越南民主共和国。
    在殖民地压迫者的枷锁下，还有数万万亚洲的妇女们和儿童们正遭受着殖民地的战争并且英勇地斗争着。在几天以后她们的代表们，将会集在你们的城市里，北京将看到一件对亚洲妇女的生命中有历史意义的事件，这事件象征着正走向完全解放的亚洲大陆上妇女斗争的新阶段。
    在这一次亚洲各地姊妹们以及其他国家中站在她们一边的朋友们的聚会中，将要彼此交谈，互相诉说她们的生活和斗争，将要并肩为争取幸福安全自由和安定的工作，以及持久和平向杀害她们孩子们的刽子手作战；这就是亚洲妇女大会的意义。
    最后，他向中国妇女特别是北京的妇女们致谢，为了她们对亚洲妇女会议的筹备工作以及许多物质上重大的帮助。
　　阿米塔达维讲话
    【北京讯】出席亚洲妇代大会印度代表阿米塔达维在北京市第一届妇女代表大会上讲话。她说：“我们印度的男人和女人一向注视着我们伟大的邻邦——中国的斗争的发展，抱着无限的希望，并从中得到很大的启示。我们印度的男人和女人要加强对尼赫鲁卖国政府的斗争。尼赫鲁，和过去蒋介石一样，由于惧怕印度民主运动的高潮，企图把我们放在英美战争挑拨者的战车上。
    昨天接到一个消息：我们国家里有三十个农民（包括妇女）领袖被处死刑。这消息使我们的血液沸腾起来了！我们知道全世界的民主人民都会和我们一样悲伤，共同感到这是我们的遭难。亲爱的中国姊妹们，我很荣幸地告诉你们，我们印度妇女保证我们是能够继承全亚洲，以至全世界民主妇女的优良传统的。我们具有胜利的信心。因为我们知道，有你们，中国的妇女和全体人民，有世界民主妇联，和我们一起，坚持不断地为和平民主斗争，领导全世界的妇女。而在这上面，更有我们伟大的苏联领导全世界的民主人民为打败帝国主义斗争。”
    最后，她高呼：“我们的人民领袖斯大林同志及毛泽东同志万岁！中国和印度伟大人民的团结万岁！在国际民主妇女联合会的旗帜下，世界妇女的团结万岁！”（附图片）
