About the condemnation of new war preparations and the five powers' strengthening of the peace treaty: the full text of Vyshinsky's speech at the UN General Assembly's Political Committee on November 16, 1949 (Part One)

The five powers bear the primary responsibility for peace

I believe that we must first draw everyone's attention to the features that can be immediately seen in the discussions of the Soviet proposal in the Political Committee over the past few days. These features are the malicious and extremely one-sided nature of the speeches by those who oppose the Soviet proposal, speeches that contain so much distortion and brutal attacks on the Soviet Union and its foreign policy. These speeches list so many issues that are completely irrelevant to the Soviet proposal on condemning new war preparations and the five powers' strengthening of the peace treaty that it is clear to everyone what the true intentions of our enemies are. Their intention is to divert public opinion from the main issues we are facing, issues that need to be resolved because the danger of a new war threatening the world cannot be eliminated without resolving them.

Some speakers, in opposing the Soviet proposal for the five powers to strengthen the peace treaty, say that all member states of the United Nations bear the responsibility for peace. This is of course correct, because there is no member state in the United Nations that can exempt itself from the responsibility for inciting and preparing for a new war, as well as for promoting the cause of peace; however, no matter how much this issue is discussed here, no one can refute the fact that the five permanent members of the Security Council should bear the primary responsibility for peace; precisely because of their international status, they play a special role in international relations and therefore should bear this responsibility. Therefore, we must resolutely oppose any attempt to reduce the responsibility of the five powers for the cause of peace, to use empty talk about the equal responsibility of all member states of the United Nations to exempt the great powers from this responsibility, which in fact primarily and mainly should be borne by the five powers. This responsibility of the great powers is an undeniable fact, and those who deny this responsibility or, behind the backs of all member states of the United Nations, try to reduce this responsibility in various ways, only prove that they not only do not want to bear this responsibility but also do not want to take effective measures necessary to consolidate peace and international security.

This is primarily directed at the American representative, whose speech can only be considered an attempt to obstruct the adoption of the Soviet proposal and thus obstruct the adoption of measures aimed at opposing new wars and consolidating peace.

Mr. Austin, in his speech, emphasized that the Soviet Union has raised the issue of new war propaganda and preparations not for the first time. This is correct. But what does this prove? At least it proves two facts.

First, it proves that the war propaganda carried out by certain countries, primarily the United States and Britain, over the past few years has not stopped, and recently new war preparations have been widely developed.

Second, it proves that we have consistently striven to make the United Nations General Assembly sincerely formulate measures to consolidate peace. This proves that the Soviet Union truly adheres to a consistent policy of consistently fighting not only against war propaganda but also against new war preparations.

Mr. Austin! The reason your country's representative has to listen to our proposals on peace every year is here.

American militarists try to cover up new war preparations

Mr. Austin denies that the United States is engaged in new war preparations. However, denial is not enough. Proof that it is not engaged in new war preparations is required. I have cited many facts and pieces of evidence proving that new war preparations are underway. Are the facts we have cited not enough? Does Mr. Austin still think that these facts prove nothing? If so, Mr. Austin should also provide proof. However, he does not want to prove anything at all and does not want to explain why our evidence cannot stand. Without citing a single fact to refute our argument, which is supported by many materials, he does not want to prove anything at all.

Did Mr. Austin refute the crazy war declarations made by General Bradley? Did he refute the crazy statements made by the U.S. Secretary of Defense Johnson? But these two gentlemen are not insignificant figures in the American government system; they are official representatives of the American government! One might expect that Austin would make some explanation of these crazy statements, that he would say: "You have misunderstood what Bradley said," or "He did not say these things, he did not have these thoughts, you have distorted and misunderstood, therefore your proof is not credible." However, Austin did not say a word of this kind. He remained silent, assuming the pose of the Egyptian Sphinx, and sometimes I thought he was not Mr. Austin but the Sphinx. Austin simply ignored these facts as if they were passing by like the spring wind over the ears of a horse. I will cite some more facts: there is a course called "Special Strategy for Anti-Soviet War" in American military schools. This course is not taught in an insane asylum or a club but in the military school at Maxwell Air Force Base. Now I ask, is this not true? No, it is true, Austin cannot deny it, he cannot.

The entire reactionary press in the United States is loudly and widely reporting calls for the blood of the Soviet Union. Austin feigns calm, as if nothing of the kind is happening in reality, as if these newspapers are playing praises of the Soviet Union, not publishing vile slanders and unrestrained calls for war against the Soviet Union.

You ask for facts. We have cited these facts. If these facts are not enough for you, we can cite more. Austin is obviously displeased with our proposal. He is dissatisfied that we speak the truth, that we call war preparations war preparations, that we call warmongers warmongers. Austin is dissatisfied that we call things and people by their proper names. He simply says that reproach will not be beneficial to constructive cooperation, and provocation cannot promote friendly cooperation.

When American militarists are openly inciting war against the Soviet Union, what kind of friendly cooperation is Austin talking about? The words "provocation" can only be appropriately applied to the behavior of the American militarists. Austin says that the Soviet proposal is to condemn the United States and Britain for preparing a new war. Yes, that is so. We said so in the first sentence of our proposal. We said so at the plenary session on September 23. We repeated it here on November 14, and I repeat it again today.

Someone says to us: This is a serious condemnation. Yes, it is a serious condemnation, but it is a condemnation based on facts. You say that we will thus necessarily become a court, and therefore these facts must be examined. I welcome this, but I cannot agree with, for example, the speech of the Peruvian representative, who did not cite a single fact, who talked a lot about diplomatic customs and his rich experience as a diplomat, who spoke at length, but did not say a word about the content of our proposal. This is not a discussion of the issue, not a study of the facts, and in such a case, you naturally have no right to consider yourself the highest court of justice for events of international importance.

Gentlemen! To judge this issue, we must examine the facts and not evade their examination. Avoiding the examination of facts will not help those who think they represent the majority here. Outside this hall, the majority in the countries of the East, South, West, and North are closely watching what is happening in this hall, in the Political Committee and the plenary session.

We promised to cite more facts, and we will do so, but we have the right to make our demands, and this demand is that we must respond to the facts we have cited. You ignore them. You just say—give us more facts. We will present other facts to you, but you (I mean those who criticize me) remember: we will not forget that you have not responded to those facts, that you prefer to remain silent about these facts. Therefore, you say: What do these facts mean? What is their significance?

Let us return to the facts! These facts show that the reactionary cliques in the United States, Britain, and some other countries—there is no need to list them one by one—are preparing for a new war. The main role here is played by the ruling clique in the United States, which openly supports the preparation for a new war, not only in propaganda but also in a sharp increase in military budgets, in an arms race, in bases organized specifically for war preparation, and in state groups organized specifically for conducting war.

What facts do we have? Please listen to me.

In September 1945, Assistant Secretary of the Navy Hanse in a public press conference on his views on the Navy Department said: The United States must obtain a vast network of post-war bases around the Pacific, including bases formerly belonging to Britain. Indeed, according to authoritative materials (which no one has refuted), during the entire war period, the United States established 256 large and small bases of various kinds in the Pacific theater, and 228 land, sea, and air bases in the Atlantic theater, totaling 484 bases. After the war, the number of these bases has increased again.

In October 1948, a communiqué published in London confirmed the existence of permanent bases for American super "Flying Fortresses" in Britain and confirmed that 90 American B-29 super "Flying Fortresses" were stationed at these bases, divided into three strategic bomber air force divisions. Former U.S. Air Force Commander Spaatz at the time boasted that he could intimidate people with weak nerves, saying that the atomic power that these 90 American bombers could unleash would be equivalent to 19,800 super "Flying Fortresses"! On November 4, 1949, just a few days ago, The New York Times published a news item saying: After seriously considering it for 24 hours, the British government finally agreed on November 3 to accept the American proposal to hand over 70 American B-29 bombers to Britain. These bombers will soon be sent to Britain as part of the military aid plan under the North Atlantic Treaty. The New York Times pointed out: After a long discussion, the British government adopted the above decision, during which high-ranking officials of the Royal Air Force, the Air Ministry, and officials of the Cabinet Defense Committee who participated in the discussion all thought it was inconvenient to accept these American planes.

What do these irrefutable facts show? They first show that Britain has no confidence in itself, it admits its military weakness, it entrusts the fate of the country to the American armed forces, and thus to those who command these armed forces. In addition, this is evidence that a large air force and army are indeed being concentrated in Britain, proving that Britain has been turned into an American military base, from which it is very easy to reach the target of attack. Which target? Think about this question. Who will be subjected to the attack with the atomic power equivalent to 19,800 bombers? Is it France? Belgium? Luxembourg? West Germany? Sweden or Norway? Who exactly? You are silent, yes, you answer this question with your silence! All the speeches of Austin, McNeil, and their friends who dominate the North Atlantic Treaty are aimed at justifying the attack on the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries! This attack is being prepared. The United States is establishing bases in the territories of other countries, including Britain, while accusing the Soviet Union of preparing armed attacks. Thus, those who are establishing bases are not preparing for an attack, while those who are not establishing bases are preparing for an attack! But after all, one cannot attack with empty hands! Those who are arming are lovers of peace, they are the builders of peace; while those who demand disarmament and the signing of a peace treaty are the real aggressors! Do you think anyone will believe such logic? Do you think such logic can convince anyone?

Let us continue. In 1948, The New York Times published a message from Nicosia, Cyprus, saying: Cyprus is being turned into an important strategic base by Americans and British. According to the reporter of the newspaper, this base must become a point of support against the expansion of the Soviet Union. This means that Cyprus has been included in the system of attack on the Soviet Union.

At the same time, according to the reporter of the newspaper, although Cyprus is a British colony, the plan to turn Cyprus into an anti-Soviet fortress was drafted not so much under Anglo-American joint control as under the sole control of the United States.

In September 1948—this is known to the whole world—Senator Vandenberg, Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, met with Franco. According to the correspondent of the Daily Mail in Madrid: Franco demanded that Spain be admitted to the United Nations and that it be granted all the benefits enjoyed by Marshall Plan countries in exchange for the United States obtaining Spanish bases.

Of course, now we can see clearly where the reason lies for the delay in approving the new member states applying for admission to the United Nations. The reason is that the United States and Britain are trying to bring in countries like Portugal and Spain to the United Nations by various means. It must be frankly said that their entry into the United Nations will not bring any benefit to the United Nations. The important thing is not here. The important thing is the transaction carried out behind the back of the whole world. This transaction is: "Give us bases, and we will allow you to join the United Nations."

As reported by American newspapers now, the State Department is seeking to obtain the right to use the ports of Cadiz, Ceuta, Valencia, Barcelona, and Velez from Franco; the right to expand existing military airfields; the right to build new airfields, especially in the coastal areas near Catalonia and Aragon, close to the inland plateau. This directly indicates that the United States is eager to have another Balearic Islands for the use of the American armed forces.

Here we have such information: as early as 1947, the United States concluded a secret agreement with Spain, according to which the United States obtained the right to establish 13 bases in Spanish territory. "World Affairs Report" magazine also published the same news, saying that the United States had reached an agreement with Portugal to establish seven bases in the Portuguese mainland and five bases in Portuguese colonies. In July 1949, the Associated Press published a news item saying that the United States was drafting a plan to establish forward air bases in the heart of the Arctic, and the news agency also explained why this was necessary for the United States. It said: This need arises because planes can refuel there when flying over the Arctic in combat...

You want to tell me: these combat operations over the Arctic are aimed at whom? At Sweden, Norway, Denmark, or Iceland? Over the Arctic—these combat operations could be directed at whom? To conduct combat, such horrifying preparations are needed: bases, hundreds of planes, and atomic bombs. This, as is known, is the last hope of the American military.

The same Associated Press report was also denied, saying that they—the editors—had just received news from the Air Force Department—the U.S. Air Force Department—about the plan and budget for establishing a heavy bomber base in Reims. The news said that a typical Arctic operation might require refueling for planes taking off from American bases at forward bases in northern Canada, Greenland, or even on the Arctic ice...

One can cite a whole pile of facts, which prove that the anxiety felt by the American preparations for war, under the guise of various peaceful and peace-loving phrases, is fully justified, and also prove that there is full reason to assert that the United States is preparing for war.

Finally, it will also be important: to explain to world public opinion the purpose of maintaining the military bases established during the Second World War against Hitler's Germany and militarist Japan. For what purpose were not only these bases maintained but also new bases established? Who were these bases designed to counter? In other words, what peaceful purposes do these bases have?

It must be admitted that so far, neither we nor any other ordinary person have received any definite answer from the American side to these questions, not even one question.

One cannot consider that the speeches of the American representatives—military or civilian, former and current senators—heard by us time and again are answers to these questions, they talk a lot about the military vacuum that must be filled, because according to physics, nature does not allow a vacuum to exist, or they talk a lot about the need for mutual aid, defense, etc. Because now, everyone knows that no one is planning to attack the United States or any other country participating in the North Atlantic Treaty, therefore, there is no one to defend.

The North Atlantic Alliance—an instrument of aggression, not peace

Austin tries to convince us here that American policy is peace-loving. He cites his speech in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to prove that the main purpose of the North Atlantic Treaty is to help the United Nations achieve its main purpose, in other words, to maintain peace and security. Austin also cites a passage from that speech saying that the North Atlantic Alliance is only an alliance against war. For this, he also mentioned—now I quote his words to say—American policy aims purely at ensuring international peace and security through the United Nations, therefore, armed forces cannot be used except for common interests. Austin further insists: The United States is trying to establish armed forces of the United Nations as stipulated in the Charter.

This is what Austin assures us, boasting of American foreign policy as a policy of love for peace, opposition to war and military gambling, boasting of a policy of consolidating peace.

Is this in accordance with the facts? No, this is not the case, therefore (I quote Austin's own argument), someone says to us: Since the United Nations Charter already includes the obligation to strengthen peace, then there is no need to conclude a five-power peace treaty. But why, knowing that the United Nations Charter stipulates various obligations, do you still conclude the North Atlantic Treaty? This argument is very unconvincing.

Even if the purpose of the North Atlantic Treaty is the most peaceful, but since there is already the United Nations, it is still possible to have a North Atlantic Treaty of twelve countries (the United Nations organization includes fifty-nine countries), then why not have a five-power treaty? Why should the five-power treaty be considered a violation of the principles of the United Nations?

I must say: all the talk about the peaceful purposes of the North Atlantic Treaty is untenable, and the talk about the North Atlantic Treaty acting through the United Nations for common interests is also untenable, it does not correspond to the actual situation, because the United Nations did not agree to the establishment of the North Atlantic Alliance. For very natural reasons, you organized this alliance without inviting us and many other countries to participate. Because this alliance is directly against us.

Austin pats his chest and says that everything is for peace, completely for peace, the North Atlantic Treaty absolutely does not engage in any military purposes, and mentions the fact that the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Romania have concluded treaties.

But these treaties are directly aimed at countering possible future German aggression, which is a real danger and will be a threat to us in the future, especially because of the policies of the United States and Britain in the Western German occupation zone, German militarism has not been eliminated but has been encouraged. West Germany will become a future signatory of the North Atlantic Treaty, and the consequences of this will be that West Germany will be turned into a bridgehead for attacking other countries, the Soviet Union, and its friends.

If the North Atlantic Treaty is also for peace, then why, in such a situation, does the United States obstruct the measures to establish the armed forces of the United Nations? Why have we not been able to reach an understanding on the principles of the number and quality of the armed forces of the United Nations for four years? If the policy of the United States, as you say, is truly aimed at ensuring peace and security through the United Nations, then how is it possible to establish an organization like the North Atlantic Alliance outside the United Nations, even in competition with the United Nations? Besides the twelve countries participating in this alliance out of the fifty-nine countries meeting here, what relation does the United Nations have with the North Atlantic Alliance? Austin, what right do you have to say that the North Atlantic Alliance is established through the United Nations? And what right do you have to say that the armed forces of the United Nations should not be used except for common interests? If the armed forces of this North Atlantic Alliance are to be used, for whose common interests will they be used? Whose "common interests" will these be? Twelve countries participate in this alliance, fifty-nine countries participate in the United Nations, and there are another ten countries that may join this organization. The armed forces of these twelve countries, or more precisely, those controlled by the one country that is controlling everything—America—will be used for whose "common interests"? This alone is enough to convincingly show that the purpose of American policy is completely different from what Austin says here. The purpose is more forcefully and authoritatively stated by—allow us to say this here—Bradley and Johnson and others who guide the American military and formulate American foreign policy.

No international control, but American super-trust

Austin is unhappy with the second paragraph of the Soviet proposal, which discusses the prohibition of atomic weapons and actual measures for the implementation of this ban through international control.

What did Mr. Austin explain about this issue? He has become a real poet, hasn't he? It turns out to be a sweet high note.

It turns out to be a man-made olive branch surrounded by thorns, it is talk of peace, but it sounds like war. He is no longer a senator (although he was one), but a real poet! But besides these, what else did he say about the content of this second paragraph? If one puts aside all these nice words, all these laboriously feigned poetic fantasies, what remains is only Austin's excitement. Obviously, only excitement and loss of self-control can explain the entire effect of Austin's speech, in which he said: We have ignored the conclusions of the Assembly, effective prohibition of atomic weapons can only be achieved after all dangerous atomic materials and all methods related to their manufacture and use are handed over to an international organization—the American representative calls it an international cooperation organization.

But this does not correspond to the actual situation. Have we really ignored the decisions of the General Assembly? On the contrary, we have thoroughly analyzed this decision and proved that the requirement to place all atomic materials and all enterprises processing these materials under the so-called international agency (whether based on property rights or ownership) is unacceptable. Moreover, we have explained the reasons. All those who oppose us have been refuted by the facts, namely, we defend national sovereignty, we oppose turning the international control organization into an American super-trust. They try to reduce the whole issue to some theoretical chatter about legal concepts. But the point at issue is completely different. I cited here the memorandum of the committee led by Acheson in 1946. I cited several other documents, especially the report by Mr. Barnard, which Austin is undoubtedly familiar with, this report revealed the ins and outs of the proposal to transfer atomic resources to the property of the international control organization and the opposition to our proposal. These issues remain unresolved, although their clarification would eliminate many of the grounds for the disagreements that have arisen here.

But this has not been done. We say that transferring all the atomic resources of each country, all enterprises processing atomic materials, all so-called related industries—metallurgy, chemistry, etc.—and all scientific research institutes to the property of this international control organization is impossible, because it means paralyzing the entire economic system of the state, especially for those countries where the power industry plays a decisive role in the development of the national economy, and atomic energy plays a special role.

Let us take the issue of sovereignty alone. Even if, as someone says here, sovereignty is obsolete, ancient, some feudal, medieval theory, all this is of course wrong. But let us not dwell on this. Let us break out of the trap of legal scholars, let us clarify this from the point of view of the life of the state and the nation. From this standpoint, it is also necessary to reject the American proposal to transfer atomic resources and atomic enterprises to the property of the control organization, because we do not allow the entire economy of a country to be controlled by this organization according to the American plan (this plan, as its authors themselves admit, is inevitably flawed).

In addition, there is no need to transfer atomic energy resources to the property of the control organization, this can be considered already determined. This is said by authoritative figures, Americans themselves. Such plans and proposals have no reason. Unless there is an attempt to control all the equipment of atomic energy, to concentrate it all in one hand, to become a monopolist, in order to manipulate the economic development path of any country and the national development path of that country. The point at issue is not the theory of national sovereignty, although this is also very important for national sovereignty. We cannot agree with the denial of sovereignty, we are not the first year here to hear such talk. The point at issue is the vital interests of a country, only those who have nothing more to lose in this regard, only those who, due to the process of historical development, are in a position where they cannot oppose, only such people, when forced to drink this bitter cup, have no choice.

But we are not in this position. We have never been and will never be in this position. To maintain our economic and political independence, we have sufficient strength and means. We confidently look to the future, we have a great past and a great present, a present created by the genius of the Soviet people, and we will reject any plan to subject our country to the control of foreign capitalist organizations. It is quite obvious that we have two camps, each with its own ideas, and if we cannot find a way to reach an agreement, naturally our cooperation will become impossible.

But is such a way to be found? It can be found. And I will later specially prove this very important issue of cooperation, this very important issue is raised because the meeting talked about war, talked about two systems, talked about the possibility of cooperation, talked about the statements of our great leaders Lenin and Stalin, our leaders Marx and Engels. Yes, gentlemen, we are guided and inspired by Marxism and Leninism. We stand on this position because this is the greatest scientific achievement in sociology and economics about the paths of human social development, and our activities are based on science, not on fantasy. But now I want to talk about the Soviet proposal and how much sincerity there is in the speeches criticizing us.

The Soviet proposal is very moderate. Our proposal on atomic energy, reflected in the second paragraph of the Soviet proposal. The main point of the Soviet proposal is to instruct, guide, and recommend that the United Nations General Assembly order, instruct, and recommend that the Atomic Energy Commission stop delaying and quickly implement actual measures to prohibit atomic weapons and establish strict international control. From the point of view of those who truly care about this matter, can such a proposal hinder or impede the solution of the problem? Can the adoption of such a proposal exclude the authority of the Atomic Energy Commission or any other appropriate authority to begin drafting actual measures to prohibit atomic weapons and control? But I can say with certainty that the resolution on atomic energy adopted yesterday in the Special Political Committee and naturally also to be adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in the future, just like all the resolutions on this issue adopted by the United Nations General Assembly before, that is, it is of no importance.

In this regard, we do not need words, but we need real actions, we only make a demand to the Political Committee (through it to the United Nations General Assembly)—to adopt a resolution that can solve practical problems. If you want to prohibit atomic weapons, then formulate actual measures. But if you do not want the Assembly to formulate actual measures, then we have the right to announce to the whole world: you do not want to prohibit atomic weapons. This has been proven by the report of Mr. Acheson's committee cited above, and you, who defend this plan, want to hush it up. But you cannot hush it up, because Mr. Acheson's letter says directly: "This is the control plan we have drawn up for you. But, Senator, do not think that by adopting this plan, the United States will have to stop producing atomic bombs. No, the United States will not have to do this. This is still to be decided by Congress from a higher political point of view, we will not care about the international control plan, we will solve this problem according to our constitutional procedures." That is to say, we will decide in the Senate whether to keep these atomic bombs and increase the stockpile. Not only that, but from the above report, it can be seen that, as said by the Chairman of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, Lilienthal, the main direction of attention of the Commission is not to find ways to stop the production of atomic weapons, but to stockpile as many atomic bombs as possible. As early as 1946, the Lilienthal Commission realized that one day the clock of history will strike, and then other countries will be able to compete with the United States in the production of atomic bombs! This clock has struck, and it struck several years earlier than the American fortune-tellers predicted.

We are now striving to prohibit atomic weapons and establish strict international control to supervise the implementation of this ban. But the plan they put forward cannot satisfy anyone, except those who do not want to prohibit and control. But they give us the opposite assurance, saying that they—the critics—are also advocates of prohibition and control. We say: Well, let us work together and formulate practical methods. But on this point, they say: "This is useless! Accept our plan." But we say: "Your plan is not good." And not only do we say this, but your own representative also says this, for example, Mr. Osborn. You reject our proposal, and thus completely expose yourselves.

Austin proposes that the Political Committee reject the second paragraph of our proposal. He mentions that the Atomic Energy Commission has already studied the issue of atomic energy. But this does not prevent the Political Committee from accepting our proposal and drafting a concrete opinion on prohibition and control, especially since the Atomic Energy Commission has not discussed or adopted such a proposal. Only those who do not want to speed up this work, who do not want to prohibit atomic weapons, will oppose the opinion proposed in the second paragraph of our proposal.

American and British critics try to deceive public opinion

Now, let me say a few words about some other issues raised by Mr. Austin—Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Poland's elections. All these issues are dragged in here to divert attention from the Soviet government's proposal to consolidate peace and to deceive public opinion. My Polish colleague has already answered the question about Poland. I would like to say a few words about what Austin said here about the other few countries. First of all, I would like to mention what we said when discussing the issue of the governments of Hungary, Bulgaria, and Romania violating so-called human rights. We talked in detail about all these things. We cited facts, and you voted. We cited facts, and you remained silent. But the head of the Polish delegation, Mr. Wyrbłowski, happened to mention the Greek elections, which were elections full of fraud and deception. Indeed, this is a fact: the member of the International Control Commission, Professor of California University, was expelled from the Control Commission for exposing the fraudulent nature of these elections. Austin and McNeil avoided this without a word, but they slander the elections in the people's democratic countries with impunity. Austin thinks it is appropriate to repeat such nonsense again, saying that I sent an ultimatum to the King of Romania in 1945, demanding an answer in two hours and five seconds. Where did Austin get such precise information? From the former King of Romania himself? Should we invite this former king here to ask him?

In fact, of course, there was no such ultimatum. There was only the conspiracy of General Rădescu and a small group of generals—the agents of Hitler—who rebelled. This was in February 1945. At that time, the Red Army was fiercely advancing towards Berlin, while Rădescu and other traitors were plotting to sabotage the rear of the Red Army. In such a situation, it was necessary to draw the attention of this king to the situation that had already arisen and to propose that the government supported by the Romanian people replace the government of General Rădescu. This was done. General Rădescu resigned, and this resignation was approved. General Rădescu immediately fled to the British Embassy in Bucharest, and everyone knows that he later went to the United States, where he is now with other traitors and adventurers who are plotting to sabotage the People's Democratic Republic of Romania.

If we are to talk about this issue, we must mention that in the same year 1945, according to the decision of the meeting of the three foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, a commission composed of myself and the American and British ambassadors to the Soviet Union, Carr and Harriman, visited Bucharest and negotiated with this King Michael and the Romanian government on the issue of adding two members of the National Peasant Party and the Liberal Party to the Groza government. This was also done.

Thus, the United States and Britain no longer opposed Dr. Groza's new government but, as we have witnessed, helped it and took measures to consolidate it. Then, why does Austin here babble about the ultimatum, about the "legitimate" government of Rădescu being replaced by the new government of Groza under the instructions of the Soviet government, and so on?

It is obvious that these lies can only have one purpose: to try to whitewash Rădescu and use him as a sacrifice for Soviet interference.

The provocative rantings of the Tito clique

After Austin, the representative of the Tito clique spoke, protesting against my calling him that. However, I do not want to change my way of addressing him. He tried to slander the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries.

Of course, the Soviet proposal to strengthen international peace and security has caused this gentleman's undisguised anger. He joined the chorus of slander and hatred against socialist countries. The representative of this clique, Mr. Djilas, was very unhappy, as he said, because the Soviet proposal proposed an incomplete and one-sided definition of war propaganda. He wanted to apply this definition to a certain aspect, and this was completely unnecessary, because this incredible suspicion is completely groundless. This speaker, however, talked about this at length, obviously having lost all sense of shame. He tried to accuse us of exerting pressure on Yugoslavia, saying that we even violated the friendship treaty. But did Tito not violate the agreement on the Danube River Navigation Joint Stock Company between Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union? Did Tito not violate the agreement on the Yugoslav-Soviet Aviation Joint Stock Company? Who initiated the violation of the agreements on these companies? Was it not the Tito government that arrested a large number of Soviet citizens? According to the Yugoslav note, these people were not accused of espionage, as Djilas fabricated yesterday here, but were arrested because they were said to be former White Guards, but in fact, it was because they advocated friendly relations between the Soviet and Yugoslav peoples. Djilas attacked the Soviet proposal, almost word for word repeating Bevin's speech at the plenary session of the General Assembly on September 26. Bevin said at the time that our proposal was a serious blow to cooperation and the hope of strengthening peace. Djilas repeated Bevin's words, saying: "This is a serious blow to strengthening peace." No one can say that the representatives of the Tito clique are still poor students. They are increasingly deeply involved in the imperialist camp they have entered. They have become more and more thorough imperialists. Therefore, it is not surprising to hear such slander and defamation from these gentlemen. Djilas also spent a lot of time on the trial of Rajk, trying to prove that this trial was fabricated. This is not a new saying.

It is well known that the Titoites are good at spreading various malicious slanders. For this purpose, they have experts like Byard, who does not hesitate to slander the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries on any issue. He is also outstanding in slander on the trial of Rajk. Djilas wants to outdo Byard in fabricating various myths. Djilas is trying hard to make Rajk's confession and the entire trial of the Rajk case unbelievable. But it must be admitted: all this has had no result. He avoids talking about many important facts revealed in the trial of Rajk, many facts that make the Titoites very uncomfortable. For example, about the testimony of Blagojević, Djilas remains silent. But Blagojević is not a small figure in the Tito-Djilas-Ranković company. Blagojević is an experienced spy, the main secret spy of Yugoslavia in Hungary. He is a spy directly commanded by General Milic and the Yugoslav Interior Minister Ranković. His testimony is well known. Has Djilas forgotten? I can remind him of these words again.

Blagojević testified in court: During the war, Lombardi was sent to Switzerland with the mission to establish contact with the head of the American spy agency in Europe, Allen Dulles.

Title: The Soviet Union's Peaceful Foreign Policy and the Struggle for Peace

The following is a translation of a speech by the Soviet representative at the United Nations General Assembly, which was published in the People's Daily on February 22, 1950.

---

The aforementioned Romba had contact with Allen Dulles, the head of the American espionage agency in Europe. After arriving in Switzerland, Romba also established connections with the Trotskyite group there. In Marseille, Latynovich, and in Bari (Italy), Yuvanovich, both had secret contacts with British and American intelligence agencies. The well-known British old spy General Wyliebit is in London. After arriving in London, he handed over all the materials he knew, including intelligence about the Soviet army, to the British intelligence service. This is the evidence regarding Blanckov. But Dejilas forgot.

He did not consider it necessary to do so; instead, he chose to discuss the inaccuracies in Rajk's confession at length here. The Rajk case exposed many things that were previously unknown and made the Tito clique, which claimed to represent the people of Yugoslavia and was a builder of socialism, infamous forever. For this reason, the Soviet government faced the issue of its attitude towards the Treaty of Friendship signed with Yugoslavia in 1945. Naturally, Dejilas knew that the Soviet government's note of September 28 pointed out: During the trial of state criminals and spies who are also agents of the Yugoslav government, Rajk and his accomplices, it was revealed that the Yugoslav government had been engaged in extremely serious anti-Soviet activities for a long time, using the friendship treaty as a cover. Therefore, this treaty has been trampled underfoot by the Yugoslav government since then.

That is the fact.

The Defamer in the Guise of a "Theorist"

Next to speak was Mr. Martin, the Canadian representative, who seemed to be Senator Martin. His speech was a series of slanders and hysterical outbursts, while pretending to be a critique of the Soviet proposal. He used a lot of various kinds of slanderous nonsense and nonsense here.

First, I will talk about the main thing, and naturally, I will also mention other noteworthy facts. If people listen to Mr. Martin, then the problem facing the United Nations at present is not the problem of condemning the preparation for a new war, absolutely not the problem of concentrating efforts to defend peace. He said: The problem facing the United Nations is the fear and anxiety caused by the regions under Soviet rule.

Can people advise this Canadian senator not to worry about these regions? Let these regions do as they please, and he should worry about the miserable fate of Canada instead… (Martin interrupted the speech, saying he was not a senator.)

Look, when something does not conform to the facts, there is the possibility of an immediate response. This encouraged me, because I have been speaking here for nearly an hour and a half, and this is the first denial of what I said.

But Martin is worried about Poland, yet Poland itself is not worried, he is also worried about Romania and Hungary. But they do not ask the Canadian representative to "worry" for them, especially because the Canadian government prevents these two countries from participating in the United Nations.

Martin is also worried about one thing: According to the theory of Marxism-Leninism, war is inevitable in human history, but he, Martin, does not want war. But since that is the case, why doesn't Martin support writing these words in international documents, in appropriate international treaties? Why doesn't he want to support our proposal for a five-power pact to strengthen peace? Why does this peace advocate avoid our proposal like the devil avoids holy water?

Martin said: The Soviet government, people's democratic countries, and the general Communist Party all believe that war is inevitable. They admit that once the proletariat becomes the ruling class, it needs its own military organization. Martin cited Lenin's Collected Works, Volume 24, Page 122, as evidence. It is pleasant to hear the Canadian representative quote the words of our great teacher. It is a pity that they quote so badly and distort what they read.

What did our great teacher Lenin actually say in the section about the military organization of the proletarian state? When and under what circumstances did he say these words? What is the true meaning of Lenin's words? I think it is necessary to answer these questions, because without answering these questions, people cannot accurately understand what the great Lenin said. At that time, it was 1919, when the young Soviet Republic was surrounded by enemy countries. Even then, the famous defender of the bourgeoisie, the former Marxist Kautsky (I hope this name is familiar to Mr. Martin, I cannot be sure, but I hope so), tried to accuse the Bolsheviks of having "no socialism, only militarism." Therefore, Martin did not discover any new continent; he merely repeated the old slanders of the famous anti-Soviet defamers.

Regarding this, Lenin said at the Eighth Party Congress in 1919: "I smile and shrug my shoulders. As if there has ever been a revolution in history that had nothing to do with war." These are Lenin's extraordinary words. It was war that pressed the young socialist republic from all sides and raised this question: once the proletariat becomes the ruling class, it must establish its own military organization to defend its borders—the borders of the young socialist state. In the face of enemies attacking from all sides, in the face of the real danger to the lives of workers and peasants in the young socialist state, how could one not do so? Obviously, under such circumstances, one could not help but talk about military organization and establish this military organization to repel the crusade of fourteen countries organized under Churchill's leadership in 1918-1919.

One must say that Martin raised this question at least a year late, because at the Third Session of the General Assembly in Paris, there was already a similar self-righteous interpretation of Marxism-Leninism, not by anyone else, but by—almost a senator—former Senator Austin. At that time, he quoted a section from the Short Course on the History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks), which said that war is the inevitable companion of capitalism, and there are just wars that liberate people from capitalist slavery, and there are extremely just wars. Austin wanted to prove that the Soviet Union seeks to destroy capitalist countries, believing that war is inevitable, and therefore the Soviet Union does not strive for peace. Austin then concluded that therefore, all of the Soviet Union's efforts to strengthen peace are hypocritical, insincere, because a person who truly wants to strengthen peace would not at the same time say that war is inevitable? It must be admitted that the unfortunate commentators on Marxism-Leninism, who take it upon themselves to explain Marxism-Leninism, understand it too poorly. They show that they do not understand the significance and role of the laws of social development in social life at all. They are completely ignorant in this regard, and this ignorance, as everyone knows, has never helped anyone—Marxism-Leninism teaches that human society develops according to the laws within this society and is influenced by these laws. Capitalist society has its own laws of development. The companion of capitalism is war, economic crises, unemployment, crime, prostitution. These phenomena are produced by the laws of capitalism, and these are all the evils and companions of the capitalist system based on the exploitation of human labor, the exploitation of certain classes in society by other classes.

These social phenomena are produced by the capitalist social system, not by the psychology of people or some characteristics of people, the violation of their rights and freedoms, etc. The violation of rights itself is a result of this system. The greatest contribution of Marxism-Leninism (please forgive me for talking about this here, because it might be more appropriate on a university platform, but my opponent forces me to turn to this side. I know who I am talking to; therefore, I do not want to convince anyone or "propagandize" to make anyone believe anything. I am saying this only to eliminate the misinterpretation of our great doctrine), I will say it again, the greatest contribution of Marxism-Leninism is precisely that it discovered the key to studying the laws of human social development and thereby understanding the historical laws of this society, not in the ideas of people, nor in the views and ideas of society, but in the means of production, in the social relations of each historical period, first of all in the production relations. However, the fact that human society develops according to certain laws does not mean that people are reduced to the role of blind actors controlled by these laws. People are still people. The Canadian representative said that people are the image of God.

Look at my opponent, I do not want to say that this theory is often effective.

But in any case, people are people, society is society, it can organize social relations. People, through their organizational activities, promote the development of history. If this development conforms to the laws of development, it is progressive, if it does not conform to the laws of development, it hinders the development of society and plays a reactionary role.

People, the classes of society, therefore, play a huge role, that is, people can regulate social relations, their activities play a huge role.

This task is influenced by the domestic and foreign policies of this or that country.

The Foreign Policy of the Soviet Union—Peaceful Policy

The task of the foreign policy of socialist countries is to take measures that can solve this task to stop or completely eliminate social evils such as war. One of the measures that can solve this task is to organize the peace-loving forces of all countries, establish mutual trust, and eliminate everything that can cause conflicts that could lead to war.

Here is what the leader of the Soviet people, Lenin, said twenty-seven years ago when he received reporters from the British newspapers "Observer" and "Manchester Guardian": Our experience has given us an unshakable belief that only by greatly considering the interests of all countries can the basis of conflicts be eliminated, mutual suspicions be eliminated, and the fear of some kind of intrigue be eliminated, and trust be established, especially among workers and peasants of different languages, without which neither peaceful relations between the peoples of all countries nor any kind of successful development of anything valuable to modern civilization is absolutely impossible. From this, it is obvious that we insist—Leninism teaches us to do so—that peaceful relations between the peoples of all countries are necessary, without which, as Lenin pointed out, any kind of development of anything valuable to modern civilization is impossible.

This is why as early as 1919, Lenin said at the Seventh All-Russian Congress of Soviets: "This is why, based on the experience of the past two years (the civil war of 1918-1919), we can absolutely say that every new military success will greatly accelerate the arrival of that time—now it is already at hand—when we will devote all our strength to peaceful construction work, and we can guarantee, based on our experience, that in a few years, we will accomplish miracles in peaceful construction work that are incomparably greater than what we have accomplished in these two years of successfully fighting against the powerful Entente countries."

At that time, when our homeland was still surrounded by many enemy countries plotting against us, these words were said, is this not extraordinary?

At that time, under those circumstances, although we won over the enemy, Lenin proposed at the Seventh All-Russian Congress of Soviets to adopt the following resolution: "The Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic is willing to live in peace with all countries and devote all its strength to domestic construction work to organize production, transportation, and public affairs on the basis of the Soviet system, which it has not been able to do so far, first by German imperialism, and then by the intervention and hunger blockade of the Entente."

You, Mr. Canadian, do not understand the basic issues of Marxism-Leninism, the issues of the relationship between the laws that determine social development and the conscious efforts of society to mitigate the harmful effects of these laws and to create conditions, despite these laws, to reduce as much as possible the crises that periodically bring disasters to capitalist society.

This is why we also say that our teachers taught us, and the whole history taught us, the philosophy—war is an inevitable phenomenon of capitalist, imperialist society—there is no contradiction with the efforts aimed at limiting, suppressing the operation of this law. On the contrary, despite the fact that war is an inherent phenomenon of capitalist society, democratic forces can still thwart war with their unity and determination to prevent war. The stronger the masses are united in the struggle against war, the louder the anti-war protests of all countries, the faster the danger of war can be dissolved. The united forces of peace-loving countries can paralyze phenomena such as preparing for war, and save the world from terrible disasters.

Gentlemen, when someone here quotes some words of our teachers, some words that are scientifically proven with great depth, to prove that it seems we admit that crises and the like are inherent in capitalist society and therefore we seek to promote the development of such crises, we must say that this is absurd. Our opponents tell us that if you believe that war is inherent in capitalist society, you are advocating war. This is equally absurd, because the task is to overcome this characteristic of capitalist society—or if you like, call it a law—to mitigate the impact of this characteristic, law of capitalist society through the conscious efforts of all countries.

It was the same before the Second World War. Recall the history of the Second World War. The land on which Hitler militarism flourished was not the land cultivated by the sweet dew of American dollars in the 1930s? Was not Hitler militarism cultivated by the Munich policy of France and Britain, Daladier and Chamberlain—behind them was the great country across the ocean, the United States? On this issue, many documents can be cited.

These documents were presented in the past, and I ask you to pay attention to them. These documents undoubtedly show how and why the Second World War occurred and who is responsible for it.

During the entire period when Hitler had his claws in the whole of Czechoslovakia he had occupied, did not the Soviet Union continue to call for the defense of the independence of the Czechoslovak Republic? Did not the Soviet Union expose the Munich policy that necessarily led to and already led to the Second World War? This is the foreign policy of the Soviet Union—the policy of peace. McNair tried to distort the facts and slander our foreign policy, trying to prove that the Soviet Union does not want peace. This is nonsense! He certainly cannot prove this, for the same reason (this is what all those who oppose us are most troubled by)—there is no evidence. This also explains—please forgive me for saying it frankly—why he replaces serious consideration of our proposals with empty talk, talks nonsense, and does not mention our proposals.

McNair seems to be very committed to ensuring peaceful coexistence among countries. He said that a normal person normally expects peace, and this is completely correct. If Mr. McNair is correct, that is, if all normal people expect peace, then those who do not expect peace are abnormal people. In this case—if Mr. McNair is correct, referring to the facts, these facts, in my opinion, are absolutely indisputable, it should be admitted that in some countries there are too many abnormal people. In this case, is it not possible to put these abnormal people in an appropriate environment? For example, at least put them in straitjackets, perhaps this will ease the situation a bit.

We fully understand, and unfortunately, McNair does not want to understand, that what is referred to above is not individual countries, but certain reactionary cliques in some countries that truly want war. First of all, it is the "cold war" frankly talked about by Professor Slylyecht of Harvard University, and then it is the almost shouting of "hot" war by the top figures deciding American policy to almost the entire human race.

McNair argues that there is no war threat to the world, but before the night of the Second World War, the heroes of Munich also said the same thing. They also tried to prove that Hitler was not preparing for war, and at that time, we in the Soviet Union had warned: Hitler was preparing for war, and this war preparation should not be encouraged.

Why did the Second World War actually become possible? This is something that has been known for a long time. The Second World War became possible and then broke out, and this fact naturally proves that the Second World War was also prepared. And I know this from historical materials, we also know that the governments of Britain, France, and the United States did not take any action to prevent the organization of this war, on the contrary, they tried to calm public opinion, saying that there would be no war at all—this was only necessary to appease Hitler, and they indeed helped Hitler. They began to appease Hitler with loans and encouragement of his plundering policy.

We opposed this appeasement policy, we opposed this policy of silence, especially when those people wanted us to be silent, those people who, on the one hand, said "no war," but at the same time carried out extremely crazy war preparation propaganda, and not only propaganda of war preparation, but also war preparation itself.

McNair tried to argue, to shake the conclusion of six hundred million peace advocates: he even cited some countries where communists received very few votes to prove the weakness of communist influence. But the problem is not elections, the results of this or that party in elections in this or that capitalist country, is not a typical way to determine the mood of the people for peace.

Everyone knows that the election system has a great influence on this. Everyone knows that the "Jules Moch" system (referring to the election system drafted by the French Minister of the Interior) is a specially invented system to make those who get more votes get fewer seats.

Everyone knows that this is the historical tradition of all such parliamentary systems; the so-called "system of reduced population in counties with voting rights" has widely spread in Britain until recently, this system has made people feel it, and this is not accidental. Therefore, there is nothing to boast about the fact that in some places communists get very few votes. Six hundred million warriors for peace are six hundred million! Mr. McNair tells us: Look, your friends are getting fewer and fewer! This is a ridiculous fantasy! Our friends are getting more and more. I advise Mr. McNair to take off his blindfold, open his eyes, and look at what is happening. Has he not seen that tens of millions of people in various countries have already started to take action? Mr. McNair, these are not your friends, because you are not their friend. These people are our friends, friends of peace, in the highest sense of the word democracy.

If you have not noticed this, if you imagine that the person sitting in the seat marked "China" is the true representative of the Chinese people, then this is a very painful imagination, you will soon be disappointed, because this Nationalist Party representative cannot represent China, China is now a new China, a democratic China of five hundred million people… (The chairman asks the speaker to "maintain order, do not digress.") I am very sorry, Mr. Chairman, you do not have the courage to ask those who spoke before me and talked about absolutely irrelevant things to speak "in order, do not digress." But fortunately, I am a person with restraint. I will not interfere with your order, of course, this does not mean that I will not follow my order.

Mr. McNair tells us: "Show us your budget." He hopes to prove that we are a militaristic country; we do not want peace, we are preparing for war and building a terrible army.

"Show us your budget"—I intend to show you our budget. But McNair should know this budget without my help, because on March 11, 1949, all newspapers in Moscow published the full text of our 1949 budget. Here, talking about the budget—Mr. Chairman, can I say this? (The chairman says it is okay, laughter throughout the hall).

The Soviet state, while carrying out huge economic construction, also implemented a large-scale plan for social and cultural facilities, which is of great significance for improving the cultural level and material well-being of the people. The 1949 budget provides 119.2 billion rubles for this purpose, an increase of 13.6 billion rubles over 1948.

The amount of money allocated for this or that item from the total revenue is very large. Now, let's talk about military expenditures. In 1949, we plan to spend 79.1 billion rubles, or 19% of the budget, to maintain our armed forces. The reason for the slight increase in military spending (this figure was 17% last year) is due to the increase in wholesale prices and railway freight rates. The allocation for the armed forces in the 1949 budget ensures all the expenses of the Red Army, which faithfully defends the freedom and independence of the motherland.

This is the situation of our budget. The military needs planned in the 1949 budget account for 19%, or 79.1 billion rubles.

And what is the situation in other countries? For example, Britain? In the 1949-1950 fiscal year budget of Britain, the proportion of military expenditure is higher than before the war, accounting for 30% of the total expenditure in this fiscal year.

What about the 1949-1950 fiscal year budget of the United States? In the total amount of 420 billion dollars, the direct expenditure of the United States on armaments and the armed forces reaches 140 billion dollars, accounting for 34% of the total budget.

According to statistics, about 300 billion dollars, or 69% of the total budget of the United States in the 1949-1950 fiscal year, is directly or indirectly used for military purposes.

And in France? Twenty percent of France's national expenditure is used for military needs. But it is known that most of the military measures taken by the French army are not paid for by the French budget, but by the American budget. Incidentally, this is a good illustration of the issue of national sovereignty! Therefore, it is not accidental that British, French, and American newspapers in this regard believe that this military budget exceeds all permissible budget standards for normal conditions. Mr. McNair, the answer to your inquiry about our budget is here.

The Responsibility of the Allies and the Soviet Union

The Polish representative, Mr. Vyrubovsky, spoke very well about the role of the Soviet Union in this war today.

I am very grateful to him, but in addition to what he said, I would like to say a few more words. He recalled an episode of great historical significance. This is an episode of great significance, perhaps, gentlemen, it will help in the future when discussing the role of the Soviet Union in the Second World War, it will help some people to treat their words with greater responsibility. Initially, under the command of Eisenhower (the British Air Force under the command of Marshal Ted was also included), the Western Front was in extremely difficult circumstances. Churchill sent a telegram to the head of the Soviet government and the commander-in-chief of our army, Marshal Stalin, on January 6, 1945, saying: "The situation on the Western Front is very fierce, and major decisions of the High Command are needed at any time. You know from your experience that after losing the initiative, it is very anxious to defend a broad front. Those who understand military terms know what Eisenhower's 'loss of initiative' means.

"Eisenhower is very willing and needs to know roughly what your plans are, because this obviously affects all our major decisions. According to last night's news, our envoy, Marshal Ted, is delayed in Cairo due to the weather. His journey has been delayed for a long time, and this is not your fault. If he has not seen you yet, please inform us whether we can expect the Soviet Union to launch a major offensive on the Vistula Front in January and any other points you are willing to mention, we are very grateful. Except for Field Marshal Brooke and General Eisenhower, I will not tell anyone this extremely secret information, and I will only tell them in an extremely secret manner. We are eagerly awaiting your reply."

You must understand what Churchill's telegram to Marshal Stalin on January 6, 1945, means. This means asking for heroic efforts to save the Western Front. We do not care how these gentlemen, such as Churchill and others, treat us, how they fail to fulfill their obligation to open the second front. Our allies are in danger, and we regard it as our duty to fulfill our obligations to the allies. Marshal Stalin sent a telegram the next morning: "Your telegram of January 6, 1945, was received on the morning of January 7. Unfortunately, Marshal Ted has not yet arrived in Moscow. It is extremely important for us to have a decisive advantage in artillery and air force over the Germans. To do this, we need clear weather for the air force to take off, and we need to wait for the low fog that prevents artillery from aiming to disappear. We are preparing for an offensive, but the current weather is not good, and our offensive is not yet suitable. However, in view of the situation of our allies on the Western Front, the High Command has decided to accelerate the preparation for a large-scale offensive against the German army on the Central Front, no later than the second half of January. You do not need to doubt that we will do everything possible to help the glorious army of our allies."

What happened later? On January 17, 1945, Churchill sent a telegram to Stalin saying: "On behalf of the British government, I sincerely thank you for the great offensive launched by you on the Eastern Front. You must know Eisenhower's plan and how much it was delayed by the destructive attack of von Rundstedt. I believe that the battles on our entire front will continue, and today, Montgomery's British Second Army has begun an offensive in the area south of Roermond."

Stalin issued an order to the Red Army on February 1945: "In January of this year, the Red Army struck a tremendous blow against the enemy along the entire front from the Baltic to the Carpathians. On a front of more than 1,200 kilometers, the Red Army broke through the strong fortifications that the Germans had built for many years. In the offensive, the Red Army, with swift and skillful actions, drove the enemy far to the west. The success of our winter offensive had a major impact, stopping the German offensive in the west aimed at occupying Belgium and Alsace, and allowing the allied armies to launch an offensive against the German army, thus linking the offensive in the west with the offensive of the Red Army in the east." These facts are before us, and they are fresh and recent facts. It is at this time that we hear the speeches of the Belgian representative and the New Zealand representative, saying that we are repeating Goebbels and Hitler. Mr. McNair said today that our policy is Goebbels' policy. I quote these words not to elaborate on this matter, but only to remind these gentleman critics that even the slightest gratitude should make them not only be more careful in their words but also be more careful in their views on the Soviet Union.

The So-Called "Cultural" Affairs of Britain and the United States

Mr. McNair said that we interfere with the broadcasts of the British Broadcasting Corporation, and he also mentioned the problem of "The Voice of America," saying that we do not allow them to infiltrate the "Iron Curtain," saying that all doors and windows are closed! In addition to what Mr. Vyrubovsky said here, I must also tell Mr. McNair: In fact, all British and American radio broadcasts are the most malicious anti-Soviet propaganda. This is the incitement of rebellion, actually the incitement of anti-Soviet war. This is the most slanderous false propaganda, this is the most slanderous slander.

We are convinced that if we take some measures to ensure that all these slanders and all these slanders against our country can be broadcast and propagated without any hindrance, this will certainly arouse the general indignation and outrage of our people—this is probably not what Mr. McNair and all those who try to prevent us from hindering these broadcasts want.

Regarding this, it is necessary to make the following explanation, and here I also respond to Mr. Austin, who complains that the Soviet Union does not intend to maintain cultural relations with the United States. Mr. McNair said: Open the windows, open the doors, let fresh air flow into the Soviet Union.

I must say that in our country, windows and doors are always open for fresh air, but what kind of air is flowing from the west and across the ocean to us?

Now, a small book is published in Moscow, and I recommend this book to our critics. This book is written by the famous British journalist Ralph Parker. You, Mr. British representative, may know Ralph Parker, this British journalist lived in Moscow for eight years and now refuses to return home. Because, as he said, he cannot return to a country preparing for war with the Soviet Union. In his book titled "The Conspiracy for Peace," he details the purposes of the British "cultural" leaders who came to our country through these "open doors." Let me quote a few passages from his book. Can I? Mr. Chairman! (The chairman answers: "Yes," laughter throughout the hall.) Thank you, I will quote now. Parker wrote: "The visiting London journalists all work closely with the responsible officials, and every morning, they hold directive talks at the British Embassy. The British journalists living in Moscow are directly isolated."

Mr. McNair, open the doors to your own journalists in your own embassy! Parker wrote, perhaps this is because of the fear of the appearance of journalists, which will disrupt the harmony between the Foreign Office and the foreign journalists—the so-called "tame seals"—they can very conveniently meet the Foreign Office spokesman, Mr. Ritzdale, who is available for consultation day and night. Parker also said that he could not help but admire the Foreign Office spokesman's skill in controlling his "tame seals," and said that their reports on the work of the conference are limited to listing completely copied from the reports and news prepared by the embassy to the Foreign Office. Parker quoted a large number of facts to prove that this same British Broadcasting Corporation, in general, the Foreign Office, tried to send as many spies as possible to the Soviet Union under the cover of these journalists. This incidentally revealed the secret that the British statesman, one of the leaders of the Foreign Office, Mr. McNair, insisted on today, insisting that we, no matter what, open the windows and doors to British spies under various disguises. I must warn Mr. McNair that for such people, whether it is doors or windows, even a small window for air circulation, we will not open it.

Mr. Austin also complained here that we oppose cultural exchanges, complained that we have cut off all these cultural exchanges and do not want any exchanges.

Mr. Austin, why do you ignore some facts? Why do you not talk about the facts that occurred in 1946? At that time, six representatives of the Soviet Union and five representatives of the Ukrainian Republic who attended the Third American Slavic Congress in New York were ordered to register as foreign agents or leave the United States immediately. Among these delegations, there were writers, professors, generals, famous Ukrainian artists, poets, journalists, and professors of the University of Lvov, etc. Due to the special invitation of the State Department and the Department of Justice, all these representatives, as the saying goes, had to "roll up their bedding" and go home.

In March 1949, a Soviet delegation composed of composers Shostakovich, writers Fadeyev and Pavlenko, academician Oparin, filmmakers Grashimov and Zhoreli, and professors Lorensky, arrived in New York to attend the Congress of Intellectuals for Peace. These representatives were not allowed by the American authorities to make artistic tours. The American authorities said that since the conference had ended, they no longer needed to stay in the United States.

You complain that we do not want cultural exchanges, but you are maintaining so-called cultural relations with various traitors and defectors, such as Kravchenko, Kosygin, etc., despite the fact that they are traitors and defectors, you still support them, you use these rascals to oppose the Soviet Union in various ways! In this case, do you want us to maintain cultural relations with you? Mr. Austin, please first maintain cultural relations with the Soviet Union, and then we will reciprocate.

If you want us to entertain you with dance troupes, you want us to entertain you with our musicians, artists, actors, and orchestras, then this requires appropriate conditions, an appropriate atmosphere. But now, these conditions and atmosphere are lacking, and if you still treat traitors—the enemies of the Soviet Union—as friends, these conditions and atmosphere will still be lacking in the future.

We maintain extensive cultural relations with the peoples of various countries, and this completely refutes your lies about the "Iron Curtain."

If you are truly interested in this issue, you will know that there is not a day without some delegations leaving the Soviet Union to go to other countries, or some delegations coming to the Soviet Union. These frequent exchanges are carried out in the fields of science and art, from music and dance to football and other various sports—everything is included. The Soviet Union maintains such relations with many countries. I can name names. These countries are: Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Albania, Bulgaria, Finland, the People's Republic of China, Italy, Sweden, the German Democratic Republic, Belgium, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and Pakistan, and the Soviet Writers' Delegation is now participating in the work of the Progressive Writers' Congress of Pakistan. This is a fact! If we send our delegations, our legal experts, scientists, writers, musicians to Belgium, to Italy (despite the fact that the governments of these countries oppose these measures), then what right do you have to say "Iron Curtain," to repeat Goebbels' filthy slanders? However, we send delegations to such countries, and we are treated as friends there, we do not encounter Mr. Kravchenko and your other friends, no one wants to defame us with various myths and slanderous fabrications.

Mr. Austin, before making such accusations, please think carefully! Therefore, Mr. Austin's words that the Soviet Union does not want to follow the normal course of international intercourse, that this shows no effort to seek international cooperation, are fabrications, and there is no basis for this.

Mr. Chairman, I will end my speech.

I must say: When McNair today indulged himself in saying: This is Lenin's doctrine, this is Stalin's doctrine, perhaps this is just his playful game when he is excited, and one cannot be serious with him. Has Lenin's doctrine become outdated? Therefore, you can abandon this doctrine?

I must say: I consider such insulting words not worthy of a response.

I really do not want to say anything harsh.

Mr. McNair today used his extraordinary knowledge of Krylov's fables to frighten us. A long time ago, in private conversations, he told me: I am studying your Krylov's fables carefully. I will answer you soon.

I have been waiting impatiently, not knowing when he will answer. But today he answered me. He quoted a fable that has been translated into English. The translation seems to be quite appropriate. The title of this fable is "The Snake," and this is the name given to me by McNair, not Krylov.

According to McNair's explanation, that is, I am like a snake. I have the poisonous fangs of a snake, but I also have the melodious voice of a nightingale. It is good to be a nightingale for even a minute.

So, the one before you is a snake.

A fable is a fable, but I would like to advise Mr. McNair—if he returns to British fables, that might be better, because then he would have a more familiar basis. He used Krylov's fables as examples without studying these fables, and as a result, he made a mistake. Because if Mr. McNair thinks he needs an analogy, for the sake of objectivity, he should collect and read more fables. Mr. McNair, in your collection, I saw some other fables today, and they are also about snakes. For the sake of Mr. McNair, I am also willing to quote a fable as a response.

This fable is called "The Slanderer and the Snake." I do not want to be any analogy. Mr. McNair said here that I am a snake with the voice of a nightingale. But when I tell you this fable, I do not say who I am thinking of in my mind. You will certainly be able to guess it easily. Let me think about this fable. Well, now we will tell Krylov's fable "The Slanderer and the Snake."

This fable says: Those who advocate that the devil has no sense of justice are very sadly mistaken. Once, the slanderer and the snake had a quarrel, and both wanted to be the leader of the hell procession, and they quarreled fiercely, and neither was willing to give in. Finally, they went to the devil to resolve the dispute. The devil said to the snake: Although no one admires your morality more than I do, the decision I have to make must be in favor of the slanderer. I know that your fangs can kill people, but can your fangs, like his tongue, so skillfully spit poison from a distance, and mountains and seas cannot stop it? Therefore, he is more powerful than you. Crawl behind him and be more humble in the future. Since then, in hell, the snake has been very obedient to the slanderer.

Gentlemen, I will end here. I am very grateful to Mr. Chairman for interrupting me only once during my speech, and it was not convenient at that time. My speech is over. (End)

　　关于谴责新战争准备与五强缔结加强和平公约的提案
    一九四九年十一月十六日维辛斯基在联大政委会上的演说全文（之一）
  　五强负有和平的主要责任
    我认为必须首先请大家注意这几天政治委员会中讨论苏联建议时立即可以看出的特点。这些特点就是那些反对苏联建议的代表们的发言的居心叵测和极端片面性，这些发言中包含着这么多的对苏联和对苏联外交政策的歪曲和粗暴的攻击。这些发言列举了如此众多的与苏联关于谴责新战争准备和五强缔结加强和平公约的建议毫不相干的问题，以致于使人们毫无疑义地知道我们的敌人的真正企图何在。这种企图是在转移舆论对我们现在所面临的主要问题的注意，这些问题要求加以解决，因为这些问题不解决就不可能消除威胁着世界的新战争的危险。
    某些发言者在反对苏联关于五强缔结加强和平公约的建议时，他们说联合国一切会员国都负有和平的责任。这当然是对的，因为联合国中没有一个会员国能免除对挑拨与准备新战争以及对增进和平事业的责任；但是，不论在这里对这个问题谈得如何天花乱坠，任何人都不能反驳这一事实：即安理会五常任理事国应该负和平的主要责任；正因为它们由于其国际地位而在国际关系中发挥着特殊的作用，所以它们应该负担这个责任。因此，我们必须坚决反对想要减少五大国对和平事业所负责任的企图，想要借空谈联合国一切会员国负平等责任来免除大国这种责任的企图，这种责任实际上首先与主要地应由五大国负担。大国的这个责任，是任何人所不能逃避的事实，那些否认这个责任或背着联合国一切会员国，企图用种种办法减少这个责任的人们，仅仅是证明他们不但不愿意负担这个责任，而且不愿意采取为巩固和平与国际安全所必须的有效措施。
    这首先是指美国代表，他的发言只能被认为是企图阻止苏联建议的通过，从而阻止通过旨在反对新战争与巩固和平的措施。
    奥斯汀先生在他的发言中强调苏联提出新战争宣传和准备问题这次并不是第一次。这是对的。但是这一点证明什么呢？这至少证明两件事实。
    首先，它证明在几年来某些国家，首先是美国和英国所进行的战争宣传没有停止过，而在最近新战争准备又广泛发展了。
    第二，它证明我们始终如一地努力使联合国大会热诚地制订巩固和平的措施。这证明苏联真正奉行始终如一的方针，一贯不仅为反对战争宣传并且为反对新战争准备而斗争。
    奥斯汀先生！贵国代表每年不得不聆听我们关于和平的建议，原因就在这里。
    美国军国主义者企图掩盖新战争准备
    奥斯汀先生否认美国正在进行新战争准备。但是，否认是不够的。必须有不在进行新战争准备的证明才行。我已经举出许多事实和许多证据，证明新战争准备是在进行着。难道是我们所举出的事实还不够吗？难道奥斯汀先生还认为这些事实不能证明任何东西吗？如果是这样的话奥斯汀先生也应该加以证明。但是，他根本不想证明任何东西，也根本不想说明我们所提出的证据为什么不能成立。没有举出任何一件事实来反驳我们的立论，而这个立论是由许多材料来证明的。
    奥斯汀先生反驳了布莱德雷将军所发表的疯狂的战争声明吗？他反驳了美国国防部长詹逊的疯狂言论吗？但是，这两位先生并不是美国政府系统里的无足轻重的人员，他们是美国政府的官方代表呀！人们可以预料，奥斯汀或者会对这些疯狂言论作某些解释、他或者会说：“你对于布莱德雷所讲的话解释得不对”，或者“他没有说这些话，他没有这种想法，他说的是别的事情，你歪曲了，你误解了，因此，你的证明不能令人相信”。但是，这类的话奥斯汀一句也没有说。他一言不发，他装作一付埃及的斯芬克斯的样子，我有时还以为他不是奥斯汀先生而是斯芬克斯呢。奥斯汀干脆让这些事实象春风过马耳一样地不理会。我还要举出一些事实：在美国军事学校里有名叫“反苏战争特别战略教程”的课程。这种课程不是在疯人或半疯人的地方或俱乐部里讲授的。而是在马克斯威尔飞机场的军事学校讲授的。我现在要问，难道这不是真的吗？不，这是真的，奥斯汀不能否认它，他没法否认。
    美国整个反动报界大登特登和渲染要苏联流血的叫嚣。奥斯汀故作镇静，好象现实环境中没有发生这种事情一样、好象这些报纸是在弹着颂扬苏联的曲调，不是在登载卑鄙的诽谤和肆无忌惮的对苏战争喧嚣一样。
    你要求举出事实。我们已经举出这些事实。如果这些事实对你还不够的话，我们还可以举出更多的事实来。奥斯汀对我们的建议表示显然的不快。他不满于我们讲出事实真相，不满于我们把战争准备称为战争准备，不满于我们把战争贩子称为战争贩子。奥斯汀不满于我们以恰当的名称来称呼事物和人物。他干脆就说，责骂不会有利于建设性的合作，挑衅不能促进友好的合作。
    当美国军事主义者正在公然煽动对苏战争的时候，奥斯汀所讲的是什么友好合作呢？挑衅两个字除了恰合于美国军国主义先生们的行为以外，奥斯汀所说的这两个字还能指的是其他什么呢？奥斯汀说，苏联的建议是谴责美国和英国准备新战争。是的，就是如此。我们在我们建议的第一句里就这样说过。我们在九月二十三日的全体会议上说过。我们十一月十四日又在这里重复说过，我今天又再重复说一遍。
    有人向我们说：这是严重的谴责。是的，这是严重的谴责，但是，这是以事实作根据的谴责。你们说，我们这样就必定要成为一个法庭，因此，必须审查这些事实。我欢迎这样作，但是，我不能同意譬如象秘鲁代表那样的发言，他没有举出任何事实，他大谈其外交惯例以及他作为外交家的丰富经验，他信口高谈，但是他丝毫不谈我们的建议的内容。这不是在讨论问题，不是在研究事实，在这种情况下，你当然没有权利认为自己是对于具有国际重要性的事件的最高法庭。
    先生们！要判断这个问题，我们就必须审查事实，而不逃避审查。规避审查事实也帮不了那些自认为他们在这里代表着多数的人们。在这个会场之外的多数，东南西北各个国家中的多数，都在密切注视着这个会场上，在政治委员会上和全体会议上所发生的事情。
    我们答应另外举出更多的事实来，我们会这样做，但是，我们有权利提出我们的要求，这个要求就是必须答复我们所举出的事实。你对它们置诸不理。你光是说——再给我们举出更多的事实来。我们将向你们提出其他的事实，但是你们（我是指那些批评我的人）记住：我们不会忘记你们还没有答复那些事实的，你们偏偏喜欢对这些事实保持缄默。因此，你们就说：这些事实是什么意思呢？它们有什么意义呢？
    让我们回过头来谈谈事实吧！这些事实说明美国、英国和某些其他国家——我无需把它们逐一举出——的反动集团正在准备新战争。这里的主要角色是美国的统治集团，它公开支持新战争准备，这不仅表现在宣传上，而且也表现在猛烈地增加军事预算上，表现在军备竞赛上，表现在为了专门准备战争而组织的基地上，以及表现在为了专门进行战争而组织的国家集团上。
    我们有什么事实呢？请诸位听我说吧。
    一九四五年九月，美国海军部助理部长汉塞尔在公开的记者招待会上谈他对海军部的意见时说：美国必须取得巨大的、环绕太平洋的战后基地网，包括以前属于英国的基地在内。真的，根据权威方面的材料（这些材料没有人反驳过）来看，在整个战争期中，美国在太平洋战区建立了二百五十六个大大小小、各式各样的基地，在大西洋战区建立了二百二十八个陆海空军基地，总共是四百八十四个基地。战后，这些基地的数目又已经增加了。
    一九四八年十月，伦敦发表的公报，证实在英国有美国超级“空中堡垒”的永久性基地，并证实在这些基地上停有九十架美国Ｂ二十九式超级“空中堡垒”，分为三个战略轰炸机空军大队。前美国空军司令斯巴兹将军当时曾大吹大擂，以为可以恫吓神经脆弱的人们，他说，这九十架美国轰炸机所能发挥的原子威力，将等于一万九千八百架超级“空中堡垒”！一九四九年十一月四日，这是才过去没有几天的事，纽约时报发表过一个消息说：在认真考虑二十四小时以后，英国政府最后于十一月三日同意接受美国将七十架美国Ｂ二十九式轰炸机交给英国的建议。这些轰炸机不久将按照北大西洋公约的条款作为军事援助计划的一部分送给英国。纽约时报指出：英国政府经过长时间的讨论以后采取了上述的决定，在这一长时间的讨论过程中，皇家空军的高级官员、航空部和参加讨论的内阁国防委员会的官员，都认为接受这些美国飞机有所不便。
    这些不容置辩的事实说明了什么呢？它们首先说明了：英国对自己没有信心，它承认自己的军事脆弱，它把国家的命运交予美国武装部队的手中，因而也就交给了那些指挥这些武装部队的人们。此外，这也是一个证据，证明巨大的空军与陆军正确实集结在英国，证明英国已被转变为美国的军事基地，从这一基地出发，很容易到达攻击的目标。哪一个目标呢？想一想这个问题。谁要受到这以原子的威力来说相当于一万九千八百架轰炸机的攻击呢？是谁呢？是法国？比利时？卢森堡？西德？瑞典还是挪威吗？究竟是谁呢？你们沉默，是的，你们用你们的沉默回答了这个问题！奥斯汀、麦克奈尔和他们在北大西洋公约中占压倒多数的朋友的一切言论，都是为了替进攻苏联与人民民主国家辩解而发！这个进攻正在准备之中。美国正在其他国家，包括英国的领土上建立基地，同时，它却谴责苏联，说它正在准备武装的进攻。这样一来，正在建立基地的人就并不是在准备进攻，而没有建立基地的人，倒是在准备着进攻了！但是，究竟一个人总不能空着双手去攻击他人呀！那些正在武装中的人们是爱好和平的人，他们是和平的缔造者；而那些要求裁军和要求签订加强和平条约的人们，倒成了真正的侵略者！你们以为有谁会相信这种逻辑吗？你们以为这种逻辑能够说服任何人吗？
    让我们再说下去，一九四八年，纽约时报刊载来自塞普路斯尼科西亚的消息说：塞普路斯正被美国人和英国人变为重要的战略基地，据该报记者说，这一基地必须变为支持反对苏联扩张的地点。这意思是说，塞普路斯已被包括在这个进攻苏联的体系内。
    同时，据该报记者报道，虽然塞普路斯是英国的殖民地，但把塞普路斯变为反苏堡垒的计划，与其说是在英美联合控制之下，毋宁说是在美国单独控制下进行起草。
    一九四八年九月——这是全世界都知道的，美国参院武装部队委员会主席参议员戈尔尼会见了佛朗哥。据每日邮报驻马德里记者报道：佛朗哥要求使西班牙加入联合国，并予它以马歇尔化国家所享的一切利益以为美国取得西班牙基地的交换条件。
    当然，现在我们可以看得明白，某些申请加入联合国新会员迟迟未能批准的原因在那里了。原因是美国和英国企图以各种方法首先将葡萄牙、西班牙等国拉入联合国。人们必须坦白地说，它们进入联合国决不会给联合国带来好处。重要的还不在这里。重要的是背着全世界进行的交易。这个交易就是：“给我们基地，我们将准你加入联合国”。
    正如现在美国报纸报道的那样，国务院力求从佛朗哥手里取得使用加的斯、喀他基那、瓦棱西亚、巴塞隆纳及韦尔发等港口的权利；扩张现有军用飞机场的权利；建筑新机场特别是在靠近加泰隆尼亚与阿拉贡尼亚内地高原近海岸的机场的权利。这直接地指出，美国满心想再有一个巴利阿利岛供美国武装部队使用。
    这里我们有这样的情报：远在一九四七年，美国便和西班牙缔结了秘密协定，根据这个秘密协定，美国获得了在西班牙境内建立十三个基地的权利。“世界事务汇报”月刊也发表过同样的消息，该杂志曾报道说：美国已与葡萄牙达成协议，获得在葡萄牙本土建立七个基地，与在葡萄牙的殖民地建立五个基地的权利。一九四九年七月，美联社发表消息说，美国正拟定在北极的腹心地区建立前进空军基地的计划，该社并解释了为什么这对美国是必需的。它说：所以有这个需要，是因为飞机在飞越北极作战时可以在那里加油。
    你们是否愿意告诉我：这些越过北极的作战是针对着谁呢？是针对着瑞典、挪威、丹麦、冰岛的吗？越过北极——这些作战可能对谁而发？为了作战，便需要这种骇人听闻的准备工作：基地，千百架飞机和原子弹。这个，如所周知，便是美国军人最后的希望。
    同一个美联社的报道也遭到了否认，那个报道说，他们——编缉——适才从空军部——美国空军部获得在莱姆斯东建立重轰炸机基地的计划与经费预算的消息。该消息说，典型的北极作战可能需要使从美国基地起飞的飞机在加拿大北部、格棱兰或甚至北极冰上的前进基地加油……
    人们还可以引证一大堆事实，这些事实证明说，美国在各种和平及爱好和平的词藻掩饰之下进行的战争准备所感到的焦虑是有着充分的理由的，也证明有充分理由可以断言美国在准备战争。
    最后有一点也会是重要的：即向全世界舆论说明保持在反对希特勒德国及军国主义的日本的第二次世界大战时所建立的军事基地是为了什么目的。为了什么目的不仅把这些基地保持下来，而且还要建立新的基地？设计这些基地是打算对付谁？确切地说，这些基地有些什么和平目的？
    必须承认，直到现在为止，不管是我们或任何其他一般的人，都不能从美国方面得到对这些问题的任何确切答复，甚至一个问题也答复不了。
    人们不能认为我们所一次次听到的美国代表们——军人或文人以前的和现在的参议员们的演说是对这些问题的答复，他们大谈其军事真空地带必须填充，因为按物理学说大自然是不容许真空存在的，或者大谈其需要互助、防御等等。因为现在，大家都知道，没有一个人打算去进攻美国或其他任何参加北大西洋公约的国家，因此，也就没有谁要去防御了。
    北大西洋联盟—侵略的工具而不是和平的工具
    奥斯汀在这里试图使我们相信美国的政策是爱好和平的。他援引他在美国参院外交委员会上的讲演，证明北大西洋公约的主要目的是帮助联合国达到其主要目的，换句话说，是维持和平与安全。奥斯汀并且还援引该次讲演中的一段话说，北大西洋联盟只是反对战争的联盟。为此，他也曾提到——我现在引用他的话来说——美国政策的目的纯粹是以联合国为媒介来保证国际和平与安全，因此，除了共同利益之外，不能使用武装部队。奥斯汀进一步力称：美国力图按照宪章上所规定的建立联合国的武装部队。
    这就是奥斯汀向我们保证的，将美国的外交政策吹嘘为爱好和平的政策，反对战争与军事赌博的政策，吹嘘为巩固和平的政策。
    这是否符合事实呢？不，这并非事实，因此（我引用奥斯汀先生自己的论据），就有人向我们说：由于联合国宪章已包括有加强和平的义务，那么，就不需要再缔结加强和平的五国公约了。但是，为什么你虽然知道在联合国宪章中已规定有多种义务，却又缔结北大西洋公约呢？这种论据是很不能令人信服的。
    即使北大西洋公约的目的是最爱和平的，但是，如果既然已经有了联合国存在，仍然还可以有十二国的北大西洋公约的话（联合国组织包括五十九国），那么，为什么不可以有一个五强公约呢？为什么五强公约就要被认为是违背联合国的原则呢？
    我必须要说：关于北大西洋公约的和平目的的种种说法，是经不起一驳的，关于北大西洋公约是以共同的利益通过联合国而行动的说法，也是经不起一驳的，这不符合实际情形，因为联合国并未同意建立北大西洋联盟。为着十分自然的原因，你们组织这个联盟没有要我们和其他许多国家参加。因为这个联盟是直接反对我们的。
    奥斯汀拍着胸膛说，一切都是为了和平，完全是为了和平，北大西洋公约绝对没有从事任何军事目的，并提到苏联与东欧国家，与波兰、捷克、匈牙利、保加利亚及罗马尼亚等国缔结条约的事实。
    但是这些条约是直接为了对付将来可能发生的德国侵略的，这种侵略仍然是真正的危险，在将来对于我们也是一个威胁，特别是由于美英在西德占领区的政策，德国军国主义并没有被消灭，而且还得到鼓励。西德成为这个北大西洋公约未来的缔约国，这样引起的后果，将是西德被变为对其他国家、对苏联及其友人们进攻的桥头堡垒。
    如果北大西洋公约也是为了和平的话，那为什么在这种情形下，美国还要阻碍拟定建立联合国武装部队的措施呢？为什么我们四年来在关于联合国武装部队，关于组织武装部队的数量与质量原则上还不能够达到谅解呢？如果美国的政策象你们所说的那样真正是以通过联合国保证和平与安全为目的话，那么，怎么可能在联合国之外，甚至在与联合国相竞争的气氛下建立象北大西洋联盟这样的组织呢？除了现在在此开会的五十九国中间的十二国是这个联盟的参加国之外，联合国与北大西洋联盟还有什么关系呢？奥斯汀先生，你有什么权利来说北大西洋联盟是以联合国为媒介而建立的呢？又有什么权利来说联合国武装部队除了为共同的利益外就不应使用的话呢？这个北大西洋联盟的武装部队如果要使用的话，它将为谁的共同利益而使用呢？这些“共同利益”将是谁的呢？十二个国家参加这个联盟，五十九个国家参加联合国，另外还足有十个国家可能参加这个组织。这十二个国的，或更确切地说是在操纵着一切事务的一国——美国的指挥下的武装部队，又是为着谁的“共同利益”而使用呢？只消这一点就足以令人信服地显示，美国政策所从事的目的，与奥斯汀在这里说的完全不同了。把这个目的说的得更有力量更有权威的是——请容许我们在这里说出来——布莱德雷和詹逊一流的人，是其他一些指导着美国的军事，和制订着美国外交政策的人。
    不要国际管制，而要美国的超级托拉斯
    奥斯汀不高兴苏联建议的第二段，其中谈到关于禁止原子武器以及执行这种禁令的国际管制的实际措施。
    奥斯汀先生对于这个问题解释了些什么呢？他不是成了一个真正的诗人吗？事实证明这是一种甜蜜的高调。
    事实证明这是遍绕荆棘的人造的橄榄树枝，这是侈谈和平，而听起来象战争。他已不是参议员（虽然以前是），而是真实的诗人！但是除了这些以外，他对这第二段的内容还说了些什么呢？如果人们把所有这些好听的词汇，所有这些吃力地装出来的诗意的幻想放在一边，剩下的就只有奥斯汀先生的激动罢了。显然地，只有激动而丧失了自制力的情形，才能解释奥斯汀演说的全部作用，他在演说中称：我们忽视了大会的结论，有效地禁止原子武器只有在将一切危险的原子原料，与一切有关制造及使用的方法都交到国际机构——美国代表称之为国际合作组织——之后才能达到。
    但是，这也不符合实际情况。我们真的把联大的决议置诸不理吗？恰恰相反，我们彻底分析了这个决议，并且证明这个把一切原子原料及所有对这些原料加工的企业置于所谓国际代理机构（无论它是以财产权，还是以所有权为基础）的要求是不可接受的。而且我们说明了理由。所有反对我们的人已为事实所驳斥，即我们保卫国家主权，我们反对把国际管制机构变成美国的超级托拉斯。他们试图把整个问题降低到某种关于法律概念的理论上的空谈。但是争论点事实上是完全不同的。我在这里引证了艾奇逊所领导的委员会一九四六年的备忘录。我引证了若干其他文件，特别是巴纳德先生所作的报告，奥斯汀先生无疑是知道他的，这个报告透露了关于转移原子资源为国际管制机构的财产的这一建议和反对我们的建议的底细。这些问题仍然没有说明，虽然这些问题的阐明会消除在这里使我们发生各种意见分歧的许多根据。
    但是这件事也没有作。我们说，把每个国家的一切原子资源，把所有原子原料加工的企业，把所有所谓有关的工业——冶金业、化学业等等——以及全部科学研究所都转移为这个国际管制机构的财产——把所有这一切都转移为这个机构的财产是不可能的，因为它意味着使国家的整个经济体系陷于瘫痪，特别是对于那些在国民经济发展当中动力工业起着决定性作用，而原子能又起着特殊作用的国家。
    让我们单拿出主权问题来说吧，即使象这里有人所说的那样，主权是陈腐的、古老的、某种封建的、中世纪的理论吧，所有这些当然都是错误的。但是，我们且不管这些。让我们打破法律学者们的圈套，让我们从国家与民族生活的观点来加以阐明吧。从这个立场出发，也必须拒绝美国关于转移原子资源与原子企业为管制机构的财产的建议，因为我们不容许以美国的计划（这个计划正如其拟订人自己所承认是难免有缺点的）来迫使一国的整个经济受这个机构的控制。
    此外，没有任何必要把原子能资源转移为管制机构的财产，这一点可以被认为是已经确定无疑的了。这是权威的人物们，美国人自己所说的。这种计划和这种建议是没有任何理由的。除非企图控制原子能的全部设备，把它全部集中在一只手里，成为独占者，以便操纵任何国家的经济发展路线和该国的国家发展路线。争论点不是国家主权的理论，虽然这对国家主权也有很大关系。我们决不能同意主权否定论，我们不是头一年在这里听到这种论调。争论点是一国的切身利益问题，只有那些在这方面已经无可损失的人，只有那些由于历史的发展过程而处于不能反对的地位上的人，只有这种人，在被迫饮尽这杯苦酒时，才没有选择的余地。
    但是，我们不是处在这种地位。我们从来没处过而且将来也永不会处在这种地位。为了保持我们的经济与政治的独立，我们有足够的力量与办法。我们充满信心地展望着将来，我们有伟大的过去，而且有伟大的现在，为我们苏维埃人民的天才所创造的现在是我们的，我们将拒绝任何企图使我国受外国资本主义组织控制的计划。那是十分明显的，我们有两个阵营，每一个阵营有它自己的观念，倘若我们找不到达成协议的方法，自然我们的合作就成为不可能的了。
    但是，这种方法找不找得到呢？找得到的。而且我以后将对这个关系到非常重要问题的合作问题特别加以证明，这个非常重要的问题的提出，是因为在会上谈到了战争，谈到了两个制度，谈到了合作的可能性，谈到了我们的伟大导师列宁和斯大林、我们的导师马克思和恩格斯的各项言论。是的，诸位先生们，我们是受着马克思主义和列宁主义的引导和鼓励。我们站在这个立场上，因为这是在社会学和经济学方面关于人类社会发展途径的最伟大的科学成就，而且我们的活动是建立在科学的基础上，而不是建立在空想上。但是，现在我要谈一谈苏联的建议，以及批评我们的言论有多少真诚的程度。
    苏联的建议是非常适度的。我们关于原子能的建议，反映在苏联建议的第二段中。苏联的建议主要在于要求联合国大会命令、指导、并建议原子能委员会不要再拖延，而应该赶快地实行关于禁止原子武器、关于建立严格的国际管制的实际措施。照那些真正关怀此事的人们看来，这种建议能阻挠或有碍于问题的解决吗？这种建议的通过会摈斥原子能委员会或其他任何适当权威机构在开始制订关于禁止原子武器和管制的实际措施上的职权吗？但我可以一点不错地说，昨天在特别政治委员会中通过的而且将来自然也会被联合国大会通过的关于原子能的决议，正如联合国大会前此关于这个问题所通过的一切决议一样，这就是说，一点也不重要。
    在这方面，我们不需言论，但我们需要实际的行动，我们仅仅向政治委员会（经它提交联合国大会）提出一项要求——通过一种能够解决实际问题的决议。倘若你们愿意禁止原子武器，那么就要制订实际措施。但是，如果你们不愿大会制订实际措施，这就使我们有权利向全世界宣布：你们不愿意禁止原子武器。这一点已由上面所引据的艾奇逊先生的委员会的报告获得证明了，而你们这些为这个计划辩护的人们，竟还想把这个报告搪塞住。但是，你们是搪塞不了的，因为艾奇逊先生的信中直截了当地说过：“这就是我们给你们制订出来的管制计划。但是，参议员先生们，不要以为采取了这个计划，美国就会不得不停止生产原子弹。不，美国决不会不得不这样做。这还是要国会从较高的政治方面着眼来决定，我们将不管国际管制计划，我们只按我们的宪法手续来解决这个问题。换句话说，我们将依我们的意志在参院表决，愿否保持这些原子弹，并且增加储藏量。”不仅如此，从上述报告可以看出，如美国原子能委员会主席李连塞尔所说，该委员会主要注意的方向，不是想出一些办法来停止原子武器的生产，而是积储尽可能多的原子弹。早在一九四六年，李连塞尔委员会就认识到，总有一天历史的钟声会响，那时，其他的国家也能与美国在原子弹生产方面进行竞争！这个钟声已经响了，而且比美国算命先生的推算早了好几年。
    我们现在力争禁止原子武器，建立严格的国际管制，监督执行这一禁令。可是，他们提出来的计划不能使任何人满意，只有那些既不想禁止，又不想管制的人除外。但是，他们却向我们作相反的保证，一口说他们——我们的批评者也是主张禁止和管制的。我们说：好，让我们一起来工作，定出切实的办法吧。但对于这一点，他们却回答说：“这没有用处！接受我们的计划。”但是我们要说：“你们的计划不好。”而且不仅是我们这样说，连你们自己的代表也这样说，举例说，奥斯朋先生就是。你们拒绝接受我们的建议，就彻底地暴露了你们自己。
    奥斯汀提议，政治委员会否决我们建议中间的第二段。他提到原子能委员会已经研究过原子能的问题了。但这并不能妨碍政治委员会接受我们的建议，起草关于禁止和管制的切实意见，尤其是因为原子能委员会并没有讨论或者通过这样的建议。只有不想加速这个工作，不想禁止原子武器的人，才会反对我们提案第二段中所提的意见。
    美英批评者想蒙蔽舆论
    现在，对奥斯汀先生所涉及的一些其他问题——罗马尼亚、保加利亚、匈牙利和波兰的选举说几句话。所有这些问题，都勉强地拉进这里来，以便转移对苏联政府关于巩固和平的建议的注意，以蒙蔽舆论。我的波兰同僚已经回答了关于波兰的问题。我想就奥斯汀在这里关于其他几个国家所讲的话说几句。首先，我要提起我们在讨论什么匈牙利、保加利亚和罗马尼亚的政府侵犯所谓人权的问题时所说过的话，我们曾颇详尽地谈过这一切事情。我们举出事实，而你们表决。我们举出事实，而你们保持缄默。但是，波兰代表团团长维尔布洛夫斯基恰巧提起希腊选举，这是一个与欺骗和伪选分不开的选举。的确，这也是事实：国际管制委员会委员加利福尼亚大学教授因为揭露了这次选举的欺骗性而被逐出管制委员会。奥斯汀和麦克奈尔对这一切都只字不提地回避过去，他们却信口雌黄地诋毁人民民主国家内的选举。奥斯汀认为再重复一遍这种胡说似乎是适当的，说是我在一九四五年致罗马尼亚国王一件最后通牒，要求在两小时另五秒钟内答复。奥斯汀从那里得到这样的精确情报呢？是从罗马尼亚逊王自己那里得来的吗？是不是我们还应该请这位逊王到这里来问问他呢？
    事实上当然没有任何这种的最后通牒。只有拉德斯哥将军的阴谋和一小撮将军们——希特勒的代理人——的谋叛。那是在一九四五年二月间。当时，红军正在猛烈地向柏林进军，而拉德斯哥和其他卖国贼却在计划破坏红军的后方。在这种情况下，就必需请这位逊王注意已经发生的情势，并建议以罗马尼亚人民拥护的政府，来替代拉德斯哥将军的政府。这件事办到了。拉德斯哥将军辞职，这个辞职获得批准。拉德斯哥将军立即到布加勒斯特英国大使馆去避难，大家都知道，他后来又来到美国，他现在是和那些正阴谋破坏罗马尼亚人民民主共和国的其他卖国贼和冒险家在一起。
    如果要谈谈这个问题，就必须提起在一九四五年同年，根据美、英、苏三外长会议的决议，由本人和英美两国驻苏大使卡尔和哈里曼组成的委员会访问了布加勒斯特，并与这位逊王米琪尔和罗马尼亚政府谈判，把国家农民党和自由党的两名党员加进格罗查政府里去的问题。这件事也办到了。
    于是，美国和英国就不再反对格罗查博士的新政府，而正如我们所目睹的，帮助它并且采取措施使它巩固。那末，奥斯汀为什么又在这里噜嗦什么最后通牒，什么在苏联政府指示之下拉德斯哥“合法”政府被格罗查新政府所替代等等呢？
    显而易见，这些胡说只可能有一个目的，就是企图把拉德斯哥粉饰一番，用他来作苏联当面干涉的牺牲品。
    奥斯汀所夸大的故事显然是必需的，为的是要以空谈来转移人们对讨论这种严重问题的注意，譬如苏联政府关于“谴责新战争准备和五强缔结公约加强和平的建议”就是。
    铁托集团的挑拨性狂言
    继奥斯汀之后起而发言的是铁托集团的代表，他抗议我这样称呼他，但是，我不想改变我的称呼法。他企图诋毁苏联与人民民主国家。
    当然，苏联关于加强国际和平与安全的建议引起了这位绅士不可掩饰的恼怒。他加入诽谤和仇恨社会主义国家的合唱。代表这个集团发言的德热拉斯先生很不高兴，正如他所说的：因为苏联的建议里提出了战争宣传的不完全而片面的定义。他想将这种定义适用到某个方面去，而这是丝毫没有必要的，因为这种不可思议的怀疑是完全没有根据的，这位发言者在这理却对这一点不厌其烦地，唠叨，他显然已失掉了一切羞恶之心。他企图谴责我们，说我们对于南斯拉夫施以压力，说我们甚至破坏了友好条约。但是难道铁托没有破坏南、苏两国多瑙河航运股份公司的协定吗？难道铁托没有破坏苏南空运股份公司的协定吗？是谁发起要破坏关于这些公司的协定的呢？难道铁托政府没有大批逮捕苏联公民吗？根据南斯拉夫照会所说的，这些人们并没有被控间谍罪名，象德热拉斯昨天在这里所虚构的那样，他们的被捕是由于硬说他们过去是白卫军，但实际上是由于他们主张苏南两国保持友好关系。德热拉斯攻击苏联的建议，他几乎是在逐字逐句地重复贝文于九月二十六日在大会上全体会议上的发言。贝文当时说我们的建议对于合作，对于加强和平的希望是严重的打击。德热拉斯重复贝文的说话，他说：“这对于加强和平是严重的打击”。谁也不能说铁托集团的绅士代表们还是可怜的学生。他们愈来愈深入地走进他们所投入的帝国主义阵营里去了。他们已一日甚于一日地成为彻头彻尾的帝国主义阵营的分子了。因此，听到这些绅士们的这种诽谤与污蔑并不令人惊奇，德热拉斯对于拉伊克的审讯也化了不少的时间，他企图证明这个审讯是拚凑出来的。这不是新的说法。
    众所周知，铁托分子擅长于散布各种恶毒的诽谤。为了这种目的，他们有象比雅德这样的专家，他在关于苏联与人民民主国家的任何问题上都不惜横加诋毁。他在对于拉伊克审讯的诽谤上也是出色的。德热拉斯想在捏过各种神话这件事情上胜过比雅德。德热拉斯竭力想使拉伊克的供词和拉伊克案的整个审讯不为人所相信。但是必须承认：这一切都没有任何结果。他避而不谈在拉伊克审讯中所揭露的许多重要事实，许多使铁托分子感到苦恼不堪的事实。例如关于布兰科夫的证言德热拉斯就沉默不发一言。而布兰科夫在铁托—德热拉斯—兰科奇维公司里并不是一名小卒。布兰科夫是一名饱有经验的间谍，南斯拉夫驻匈牙利的主要秘密间谍。他是受米利奇将军与南斯拉夫内长兰科奇维直接指挥的间谍。他的证言已为众所周知。难道德热拉斯已经忘了吗？我可以再向他重新提起这些话。
    布兰科夫在法庭上供称：在战争期间，洛姆巴被派往瑞士，奉命与美国在欧洲的间谍机关领袖艾伦·杜勒斯建立联系。
    这位洛姆巴曾与美国驻欧洲的间谍机关负责人艾伦·杜勒斯接触。洛姆巴在到达瑞士后，也曾与那里的托洛茨基分子的集团建立联系。在马赛的拉蒂诺维奇和在巴利（意大利）的尤凡诺维奇，都曾与英美情报机关建立秘密联系。尽人皆知的英国老间谍维利比特将军是在伦敦。在他到达伦敦以后，他将他所知道的一切材料，以及关于苏联军队的情报都交给英国情报处。这就是关于布兰科夫的证据。但德热拉斯却忘了。
    他并不认为有这样做的必要，他宁愿在此间长篇大论的谈到拉伊克供词的某种不确切。拉伊克案暴露了许多在以前不为人知的事情，并使自称代表南斯拉夫人民的，并且——你没有看到吗？——是社会主义的建设者的铁托集团遗臭万年。正因为如此，苏联政府碰到了它对一九四五年与南斯拉夫所签订的友好条约的态度问题。德热拉斯自然知道苏联政府九月二十八日的照会指出了：在审讯国事犯和间谍，同时又是南斯拉夫政府的代理人的拉伊克及其帮凶时，暴露了南斯拉夫政府很久以来就一直从事极为严重的仇视性和颠覆性的反苏活动，而虚伪地以友好条约作为掩护，因此，这一条约自那时起就已被南斯拉夫政府踩在脚底下了。
    事实就是如此。
    扮作“理论家”的诽谤者
    接着发言的是加拿大代表马丁先生，似乎是参议员马丁。他的演说是一连串的诽谤和歇斯底里的叫嚣，而又不得不装成是对苏联建议的批判。他在此间用了一大堆各式各样诽谤性的胡说和妄谈。
    我首先要谈到主要的事情，自然，我也要说到其他值得注意的事实。人们要是听马丁先生说话，那么，目前联合国所面对的问题就不是谴责准备新战争的问题，绝不是集中力量保卫和平的问题。他说：联合国所面对的是他所说的苏联统治下的地区所引起的恐惧和忧虑的问题。
    人们能不能劝告这位加拿大参议员先生不要为这些地区担心呢？让这些地区自行其是好了，他还是担心加拿大的卑贱的命运好一些……（马丁打断了演说，他说他不是参议员。）
    你看，当一些事情不符合事实时，就有立即答复的可能。这鼓励了我，因为我在这里已演说了将近一个半钟头，这还是对我所说的话的第一个否认。
    可是，马丁先生担心波兰，但波兰本身却并不忧虑，他也替罗马尼亚和匈牙利担心。但它们也都不要求加拿大代表为它们“担心”，特别是因为加拿大政府阻止这两国参加联合国。
    马丁也在担心一件事情：按照马列主义学说，战争在人类历史中是不可避免的，而他，马丁，却是象他所力加申说的那样，并不想有战争。但既然这样，马丁先生为什么不赞同把这些话写在国际文件中，写在适当的国际条约之中呢？为什么他不愿支持我们所提的五强缔结加强和平公约的建议呢？为什么这个和平的拥护者逃避我们的建议，象魔鬼逃避圣水那样呢？
    马丁说：苏联政府，人民民主国家和一般共产党都认为战争是不可避免的。他们承认无产阶级一旦成为统治阶级，就需要它自己的军事组织。马丁举出了列宁全集第二十四卷第一百二十二页的话作为证明，听到加拿大代表引用我们伟大的导师的说话是愉快的。可怜的只是他们援引得这样糟糕，而且歪曲了他们所读的东西。
    我们伟大的导师列宁在被引用的关于无产阶级国家的军事组织这一节中到底说了一些什么呢？他是在什么时候说这些话、在什么情况下说这些话的呢？列宁的话的真正意义是什么呢？我认为需要回答这些问题，因为不回答这些问题，人们就不能说确当地了解了伟大的列宁所说的话。那时是一九一九年，正当年轻的苏维埃共和国被敌国四面包围的时候。早在那时，资产阶级的著名保卫者，以前是马克斯主义者的考茨基（我希望这个名字是马丁先生所熟悉的，我不能确定，但我希望如此）企图指责布尔什维克，说布尔什维克“没有社会主义，只有军国主义”。因此，马丁并没有发现任何一个新大陆，只是重复了著名的诽谤者反苏的滥调而已。
    关于这一点，列宁在一九一九年第八次党代表大会上说过：“我微笑和耸肩。好象历史上真的曾有一个和战争毫无联系的大革命。”这是列宁所说的非凡的话。正是战争，它从四面八方逼迫年轻的社会主义共和国，并且提出了这个问题，就是无产阶级一旦成为统治的阶级，就必须建立它自己的军事组织，能够保卫它的疆界——年轻的社会主义国家的疆界。在敌人从四面八方进攻，在工人和农民的年轻的社会主义国家确确实实危在旦夕的情形之下，人们怎能不这样做呢？显然，在这种情形之下，人们不能不这样做，而且绝对必需不仅谈论军事组织，还要建立这个军事组织，去击退一九一八——一九一九年在邱吉尔指导下组织的十四国十字军。
    人们必须说，马丁提出这个问题，至少迟了一年，因为在第三届联大巴黎会议上，就已经有过同样自命的关于马克思主义——列宁主义的解释，不是别人，就是——我差一点要说参议员——前参议员奥斯汀。那时，他引了联共（布）党史简明教程中的一节，其中说，战争是资本主义不可免的伴侣，有把人民从资本主义奴役下解放出来的正义的战争，有非常正义的战争。奥斯汀想证明苏联力谋毁灭资本主义国家，认为战争是不可避免的，苏联因此绝不为和平目的而努力。奥斯汀先生还从此得出结论说，因此，苏联一切肯在巩固和平的建设都是伪善的，不真诚的，因为一个一心想巩固和平的人岂能同时又说战争不可避免吗？必须承认，倒运的评论马克思主义——列宁主义的先生们，以解释马克思主义——列宁主义为己任，可是了解得太可怜了。他们表现出一点也不懂得社会发展规律在社会生活中的意义和作用。他们在这方面表现得十分无知，这种无知，正象大家知道的那样，从来丝毫也不能有助于任何人——马克思主义——列宁主义教导说，人类社会按照这个社会内在的规律发展，并受这些规律的影响。资本主义社会有其发展的规律。资本主义的伴侣是战争，经济危机、失业、犯罪、卖淫。这些现象是从资本主义的规律产生出来的，这些全是以剥削人类劳动、以社会中某些阶级对另外一些阶级剥削为基础的资本主义制度的祸害和伴侣。
    这些社会现象是从资本主义的社会制度产生的，绝不是人的心理或是人的某种特点，侵犯他们的权利和自由等等产生的。侵犯权利，本身就是这个制度的结果。马克思主义——列宁主义最大的贡献（请各位原谅我在这里谈到这点，因为在大学的讲台上谈这些或许要更合宜些，但我的对方迫使我转到这方面来。我知道我现在是在向谁们说话；因此我并不想说服任何人或向他“宣传”，使他相信任何东西。我之所以要说，是为了消除对于我们伟大的学说的曲解），我再说一遍，马克思主义——列宁主义最大的贡献，恰恰在于它发现了研究人类社会发展规律，并从而了解这个社会之历史的规律的钥匙，它不是在人的观念里面，也不是在社会的观点和观念里面找到这把钥匙，而是在生产资料，在每一个历史时期的社会关系首先是生产关系中找到了这把钥匙。但是，人类社会依一定规律发展并不表示人就降为盲目受这些规律的作用所支配的角色。人到底是人。加拿大代表说过，人是上帝的形象。
    看看我的对方，我不想说这种理论常常是灵验的。
    但无论如何，人是人，社会是社会，它能够组织社会关系。人借其组织活动而促进历史的发展。如果这一发展合乎发展的规律，它就是进步的，如果它不合乎发展的规律，它就妨碍社会的发展，就起反动的作用。
    人、社会的各阶级，因此就起着巨大的作用，这就是说，人能够调节社会关系，他们的活动起巨大的作用。
    这个任务受这个或那个国家的内政外交政策的影响。
    苏联的外交政策—和平政策
    社会主义国家外交政策的任务，在于采取能够解决这个任务的措施，来遏止或完全消除象战争这类的社会罪恶。能够解决这一任务的这种措施之一，就是组织一切国家爱好和平的力量，建立相互信任，消除一切可能发生足以酿致战争的冲突的东西。
    这里是苏维埃人民的领袖列宁在二十七年前接见英国报纸“观察家”和“孟彻斯特卫报”的记者时所说过的话：我们的经验使我们产生了不可动摇的信念，即只有大大照顾各国的利益，才能消除冲突的根基，消除相互猜疑，消除对于某种阴谋诡计的恐惧，建立信任，特别是语言不同的各种工人和农民的信任，没有它，则无论是各国人民之间的和平关系，或是任何对于现代文明有价值的事情的任何种类成功的发展，都绝对不可能。由此显然可见，我们坚主——列宁主义教导我们要如此——各国人民间的和平关系，没有这种关系，如象列宁所指出的，任何对现代文明有价值的东西的任何种类的发展都是不可能的。
    这就是为什么早在一九一九年，列宁在全俄苏维埃第七次大会上就确确实实讲过下面的话：“这就是为什么我们根据过去两年的经验（一九一八—一九一九两年内战），可以绝对肯定的说，军事上的每一新成功，都将大大加速那个时间的到来——现在已经近在眼前了——那时，我们将把我们的力量全部投入到和平的建设工作之上，我们根据我们已有的经验可以保证，不多几年之后，我们将在和平的建设工作中，完成较之我们在这两年成功地反对强有力的协约国的战争中所完成的大得无可比拟的奇迹。”
    在一九一九年，我们祖国还被许多敌视我们的策划反对我们的军事阴谋的国家所包围的时候，就说了这样的话，这不是非凡的吗？
    在那个时候，在那种情形之下，虽然我们对敌人获得胜利，列宁就在全俄苏维埃第七次大会上建议通过了如下的决议：“俄罗斯苏维埃社会主义联邦共和国愿与一切国家和平相处，把它的全部精力用于国内的建设工作，以便在苏维埃制度的基础上组织生产、运输与公共事业，这是它直到现在一直被阻而未能进行的，先是被德国帝国主义、后来是被协约国的干涉和饥饿封锁。”
    你加拿大的先生不懂得马克思主义的——列宁主义的基本问题，关于决定社会发展的规律与自觉的社会为减轻消极的规律的有害影响和为创设条件尽管有这些规律——以尽量消减周期地招致资本主义社会所充满的灾祸的危机而采取的措施两者之间相互关系的问题。
    这就是为什么我们现在也说，我们的导师们所教给我们的，整个历史所教给我们的哲理——战争是资本主义、帝国主义社会不可避免的现象——与旨在限制、遏抑这一规律之运行的努力之间并无任何矛盾。相反，尽管战争是资本主义所固有的现象，民主力量仍能挫败战争，以他们团结一致，阻止战争的力量与决心，防止战争。群众在反对战争的斗争中团结得愈坚强，各国反战的抗议呼声愈响亮，就能更快的消解战争的危险。爱好和平各国团结的力量能够麻痹备战之类现象，使世界免于可怖的灾祸。
    各位先生：当着有人在这里引用我们导师们的一些话，一些以巨大的深度，科学地确证了的话，企图以此来证明，似乎我们承认危机之类是资本主义社会所固有的因而就表示我们力谋促进这种危机的发展的时候，我们必须说，这是荒谬的。我们的对方告诉我们说，如果你们认为战争在资本主义社会中是固有的，你们就是主张战争。这同样是荒谬的，因为任务就在于克服资本主义社会这一特点——或者如果你愿意的话就叫它规律——以各国自觉的努力，麻痹资本主义社会这种特点、规律的影响。
    第二次世界大战以前就是如此。回想一下第二次世界大战的历史。希特勒军国主义所赖以发荣滋长起来的土地，不是二十世纪三十年代里美国金元的甘霖所培育起来的么？希特勒军国主义不是法国和英国、达拉第和张伯伦——站在他们背后的是大洋彼岸的大国美国——的慕尼黑政策培育起来的么？关于这个问题，人们可以举出很多文件。
    过去提出过这些文件，我请诸位注意他们。这些文件毫无疑义地说明了第二次世界大战是怎么样和为什么发生的以及谁要对它负责。
    在希特勒已经将魔爪伸入他所占领的捷克斯洛伐克的整个期间，苏联难道不是一直在高呼保卫捷克斯拉伐克共和国的独立吗？难道苏联没有揭露那个必然导向而且已经导向第二次世界大战的慕尼黑政策吗？这就是苏联的外交政策——和平的政策。麦克奈尔企图歪曲事实和诽谤我们的外交政策，企图证明苏联不要和平。这是胡说八道！他当然不能证明这一点，因得同样的原因（这是所有反对我们的人所最感苦恼的）——没有证据。这也说明——请他原谅我说句老实话——他为什么以空谈来替代认真地考虑苏联的建议，他信口空谈，而不提到我们的建议。
    麦克奈尔似乎很致力于保证各国和平共处。他说，正常的人正常地期望和平，这完全是对的。如果麦克奈尔先生是正确的话，即一切正常的人都期望和平，那末，这就是说，那些不期望和平的人就是反常的人。在这种情况之下——如果麦克奈尔先生是正确的话，参照一下事实，这些事实依我看来是绝对无可置辩的，那就应当承认在某些国家这种反常的人太多了。在这种情况下，难道不可能把这种反常的人放在适当的环境里吗？比如说，至少能把他们放在疯人的直袍里吧，或许这样会缓和一下形势。
    我们完全了解，而可惜的是麦克奈尔不想去了解，上面所指的并非各个国家，而是某些国家里真正想要战争的反动集团。首先是哈佛大学斯莱利赫特教授所直爽谈到的“冷战”，后来就是决定美国政策的美国首要人物几乎对全人类叫嚣的“热”战。
    麦克奈尔力辩没有战争威胁世界，但在第二次世界大战前夜慕尼黑的英雄们也同样这样说过。他们也曾经企图证明希特勒没有准备战争，而当时我们苏联曾经提出警告：希特勒正在准备战争，这种战争准备不应鼓励。
    为什么第二次世界大战事实上成为可能呢？这是很久以前大家就都知道的事。第二次世界大战成为可能并且随之爆发，这个事实自然证明第二次世界大战也有过准备。而且我是根据历史材料知道这件事的，我们还知道英国、法国以及美国政府没作一点阻止组织这个战争的行动，相反地，它们设法平息舆论，说不会有任何战争——这只有对绥靖希特勒才是必要的，他们果然帮助了希特勒。他们开始以贷款和鼓励其掠夺政策来绥靖希特勒。
    我们反对这种绥靖政策，我们反对这种沉默的政策，尤其是在当那些人要我们沉默的时候，那些人一方面说“没有战争”，同时却进行极疯狂的战争准备的宣传，而且不仅仅在进行这种战争准备的宣传，甚而还在进行战争准备本身。
    麦克奈尔企图争辩，企图动摇六万万和平拥护者的结论：他甚至举出某些其中共产党人只得到很少选票的国家来证明共产党影响的微弱。但是，问题决不是选举，在这个或那个资本主义国家中，这个或那个政党所得的选举结果，决不是断定人民对和平的情绪的典型办法。
    大家知道，选举的制度对这一点有很大的关系。大家知道，法国的“朱勒·莫克”制度（按指由法国内政部长主持制订的选举制度）是特别发明的制度，为的是要使那些选票愈多的人得的议席愈少。
    大家知道，这是所有这种议会制度的历史传统；所谓“郡镇人口减少而还有选举权的制度”曾经在英国普遍滋长过，直到最近，这个制度才使人们感觉到它，这绝不是偶然的。因此，对于在某些地方共产党人得到选票很少的事情，是没有什么可夸口的。拥护和平的六万万战士就是六万万！麦克奈尔先生告诉我们说，看一看吧，你们朋友的数目是愈来愈少了！这是荒唐的幻想！我们朋友的数目是愈来愈大了。我劝告麦克奈尔先生摘下他的遮眼，睁开他的眼睛，看一看他自己，瞧瞧正在发生着什么。他没看见各个国家的数以千百万计的人民已开始行动了吗？麦克奈尔先生，这些都不是你的朋友，因为你不是他们的朋友。这些人是我们的朋友，和平的朋友，在民主这个字的最崇高的意义上的朋友。
    如果你没有注意到这点，如果你设想那个坐在标着“中国”席位上的人是中国人民真正的代表，那么，这就是一种最痛苦的设想，你在不久定会失望，因为这位国民党代表是无法代表中国的，中国目前是一个新中国，五亿人民的民主的中国…（主席要求发言人“守秩序，不要离题”）我很抱歉，主席先生不能拿出勇气来要求那些在我前面发言，和谈到绝对不切题事情的人们，说话“守秩序，不要离题”。而幸亏我是一个有涵养的人。我不会干涉你的秩序，自然这并不是说我会不遵从我的秩序。
    麦克奈尔先生告诉我们：“给我们看看你们的预算”。他希望证实我们是军国主义国家；我们不希望和平，我们正在准备战争和建立可怕的军队。
    请“拿出你们的预算看看”—我打算给你们看看我们的预算。可是麦克奈尔应该不用我帮忙就知道这个预算的，因为在一九四九年三月十一日，莫斯科各报都发表了我们一九四九年预算案的全文。在这里谈预算——主席，我请求你原谅，我可以说这个吗？（主席说可以，哄堂大笑）。
    苏维埃国家，在进行巨大经济建设的同时，还实施了社会与文化设施的庞大计划，这对于提高人民的文化水平和物质福利来说，是具有重要意义的。一九四九年预算案规定以一千一百九十二亿卢布从事于这种设施，比一九四八年增加了一百三十六亿卢布。
    岁出总数当中从事这项或那项的款项是很庞大的。现在，我们来谈一下军事开支。在一九四九年，我们打算支出七百九十一亿卢布，或预算岁出的百分之十九，来维持我们的武装部队。军费之所以较去年有一些增加（去年这一数目占百分之十七），是由于批发价格与铁路运费提高。一九四九年度预算中规定的武装部队的拨款，使忠实保卫着祖国自由与独立的苏军的全部开支得到保障。
    这就是我们的预算的情形。我们的预算中所计划的一九四九年度军事需要的拨款，共达百分之十九，或七百九十一亿卢布。
    而在其他国家，这一方面的情形怎样呢？譬如说英国怎样呢？在英国一九四九——一九五○——会计年度的预算中，军费所占的比额比战前还大，在这一年度占全部支出的百分之三十。
    美国一九四九——一九五○会计年度的预算，情形又如何呢？在总额四百二十亿美元中，美国军备与武装部队的直接开支达一百四十亿美元，占全部预算的百分之三十四。
    据统计，约有三百亿美元，即美国一九四九——一九五○会计年度全部预算的百分之六十九，直接或间接地用于军事用途。
    在法国呢？法国国家开支的百分之二十用于军事需要。但是，毕竟人们都知道，在法国为法国军队所采取的大部分军事措施，都不是花费法国预算的钱，而是花费美国预算的钱。附带地讲一下，这是国家主权问题的一个不坏的说明！因此，英法美报纸在这一方面认为这一军事预算超过适用于正常情况的一切许可的预算标准，并不是偶然的。麦克奈尔先生，你对于我们预算的询问的答案就在这里。
    盟国的责任与苏联
    波兰代表维尔布洛夫斯基先生今天在这里极妙地谈过苏联在这次战争中的作用。
    我很感激他，但是，除了他所说的，我还愿多讲几句话。他追述过一个具有巨大历史重要性的插曲。这是一个具有高度意义的插曲，或许，先生们，将来在涉及苏联在第二次世界大战中的作用时，它会有助于使有些人以较大的责任感对待自己的话。当初，以艾森豪威尔为首的西线（泰德空军元帅统辖下的英国空军也包括在内），处在极端困难的情况下，邱吉尔在一九四五年一月六日向苏联政府首长兼我们军队的总司令斯大林大元帅拍了一封电报，里面说：“西方战事甚为激烈，随时都需要最高统帅部作重大决定。你由你的经验中知道，在暂时丧失主动权之后，需要防守广阔战线时，局势是多么令人焦虑。”
    懂得军事术语的人都知道艾森豪威尔将军“丧失主动权”意味着什么。
    “艾森豪威尔将军很愿意而且很需要概略地知道你有何计划，因为这显然影响他的和我们的一切重大决定。据昨夜消息，我们的特使泰德元帅为天气困于开罗。他的行程耽搁甚久，这并不是由于你的过错，假如他还没有见到你，请将我们是否可希望苏联于一月间在维斯杜拉河前线发动大攻势一点及阁下愿提及的任何其他点告知，不胜感激。除布鲁克元帅及艾森豪威尔将军外，我不会把这一极秘密的情报告诉任何人，而且也只在极秘密的情况下告诉他们二人。迫切期待之至。”
    你们一定懂得邱吉尔在一九四五年一月六日拍这样一封电报给斯大林大元帅意味着什么。这意味着请求作英雄的努力，以挽救西线。我们并不计较这些先生们如邱吉尔之流及其他的人怎样对待我们，怎样不执行开辟第二战场的义务。我们的同盟者处在危险中，我们把履行对盟国的责任引为我们的义务。斯大林大元帅在第二天早晨就拍去电报：“阁下一九四五年一月六日来电，已于一月七日晨收到。不幸，泰德空军元帅尚未到达莫斯科。利于我们在炮兵和空军方面对德国的压倒优势是极其重要的。要做到这一点，我们需要晴朗天气以便空军出动，并须待使炮兵无法瞄准射击的低雾消失。我们正在准备攻势，但目前天气不佳，我们的攻势尚不宜发动。然而，鉴于我们盟国在西线的处境，最高统帅部已决定不顾天气加速完成在中央前线对德军发动大规模攻势作战的准备，不迟于一月下半月。阁下无须怀疑，我们将尽一切可能帮助我们盟国的光荣军队。”
    后来事情怎么样呢？一九四五年一月十七日，邱吉尔致电斯大林说：“我代表英皇政府对阁下在东线发动的巨大进攻由衷地表示我们的感谢和祝贺。你无疑将知道艾森豪威尔将军的计划以及它们被伦斯特德（按系西线德军统帅）的破坏性攻击延宕到什么程度。我相信，我们整个前线的战事将继续下去，蒙哥马利元帅所部英军第二十一军团，今日已在罗尔蒙德以南的地区开始进攻。”
    斯大林于一九四五年二月向苏军发出的命令说：“本年正月，红军沿着波罗的海至喀尔巴阡山脉全部战线对敌人予以无比威力的打击。在长达一千二百公里的战线上，红军击破了德军多年来所建筑的坚固防御。在进攻时，红军以迅速的和熟练的行动把敌人远远赶到西方。我们冬季攻势的成功，有一个重大的影响，就是阻止了德军在西方发动旨在占领比利时和阿尔萨斯的冬季攻势，并使盟国军队得以发动对德军的攻势，因而联结了它们在西方发动的攻势和红军在东方发动的攻势。”这些事实摆在我们面前，而且都是新鲜的和最近过去的事实。正是这个时候，我们听到比利时代表和新西兰代表的演说称：我们是在重演戈培尔和希特勒。麦克奈尔先生今天牵强地说：我们的政策是戈培尔政策。我引用这些说话并不是要对这件事情有所发挥，只是用以提醒这些绅士批评者们，就是起码的谢意，也应该使他们不但在措词上要小心些，而且在他们对苏联的看法上也要小心些。
    所谓英美的“文化”事业
    麦克奈尔先生说，我们干涉英国广播公司的广播，同时他也涉及“美国之声”的问题，说是我们不允许他们渗入这个“铁幕”，他们说一切门窗都被关闭了！除了维尔布洛夫斯基先生在这里说过的话以外，我还必须告诉麦克奈尔先生：事实上，英国和美国的一切无线电广播，是最恶意的敌视宣传。这是煽动暴动的叫嚣，实际上是叫嚣反苏战争。这是最具污蔑性的虚伪宣传，这是最富污蔑性的诽谤谰言。
    我们深信，如果我们采取一些措施，保证所有这些诽谤和所有这些反对我国的谰言得以毫无顾忌的广播与宣传，那么，这一定会激起我国人民的普遍忿怒和义愤——这很可能不是麦克奈尔先生和所有那些设法使我们不要妨碍这些广播的先生们所十分喜欢的。
    对于这一点，需要再作如下的说明，在这里，我也对奥斯汀先生作个答复，他抱怨说，苏联无意于保持与美国的文化关系。麦克奈尔先生说：打开窗子，打开门，让新鲜空气流进苏联去。
    我必须说，在我们国家，窗子与门户是经常为新鲜空气开放着的，但是，那一个方向——从西方和大洋彼岸流向我们的是些什么样的空气呢？
    现在在莫斯科出版有一本小书，我愿向我们的批评者推荐这本书。这本书是著名的英国新闻记者拉尔夫·巴克所著的。你，英国代表先生，也许知道拉尔夫·巴克吧，这个英国新闻记者在莫斯科住了八年，而现在拒绝回国了。因为，如象他所说的，他不能回到一个准备对苏战争的国家中去。他在题为“对和平的阴谋”的书里，详细叙述了经由这些“打开着的门”到我们国家来的英国“文化”的领袖先生们怀着些什么目的。让我引几段他书上的话吧。可以吗？主席先生！（主席答：“可以”全场大笑。）谢谢你，我现在就引证了。巴克写道：“来访的伦敦记者，都与负责的官员密切合作，每天早晨在英国大使馆给他们举行指示性的谈话。住在莫斯科的英国记者是直截被隔离的。”
    麦克奈尔先生，在你们自己的大使馆里对你们自己的记者打开门户吧！巴克写道，也许，这是因为害怕记者们的出现，会搅乱外交部与外交记者——所谓“驯服的海豹”——之间的和谐关系。
    后面这个引号里的字，暗指他们可以很方便地会晤外交部新闻处处长李兹戴尔，他是日夜备供咨询的。巴克又说，他不能不称赞外交部发言人驾御其“驯服的海豹们”的技巧，并称，他们关于会议工作的记述都是限于列举完全抄自事前拟好的大使馆给外交部的记事与报告。巴克引证一大堆事实证明这同一个英国广播公司，总的说来也就是外交部，如何试图在这些记者的外衣下派遣尽可能多的间谍到苏联去。这恰巧泄露了大不列颠的国务大臣、外交部的领袖之一麦克奈尔先生今天所表现的特别坚持的秘密所在，他坚持要求我们不管怎么样，要对在各种假名掩护下的英国间谍“打开窗子与门户”。我必须警告麦克奈尔先生，对于这样的人，不管是门户或窗子，即使是一个小小的用来流通空气的窗眼，我们也不会为他打开的。
    奥斯汀先生也在这里抱怨我们反对文化联系，抱怨我们断绝了一切这些文化联系，不愿有任何交流。
    奥斯汀先生，你为什么抹煞某些事实呢？你为什么不谈谈诸如一九四六年所发生的事实呢？那时候，到美国出席纽约第三届美国斯拉夫人大会的苏联的六位代表和乌克兰共和国的五位代表被命令作为外国的代理人进行登记或者立即离开美国。在这些代表团中，有作家科尔内楚克，教授高尔布诺夫，几位将军，著名的乌克兰艺术家，诗人和新闻记者，以及罗夫大学的教授等等。鉴于国务院和司法部的特别招待，所有这些代表，如俗话所说，都不得不“匆匆卷起铺盖”回家去了。
    一九四九年三月，由作曲家萧斯塔科维奇、作家法捷也夫和巴夫连科、科学院院士奥巴林、电影制片者格拉西莫夫和乔列利、教授罗然斯基所组成的苏联代表团，不是到达纽约出席知识分子拥护和平大会吗？这些代表不是被美国当局禁止作艺术旅行吗？美国当局说，鉴于大会已经结束，他们已没有必要再留在美国。
    你埋怨我们不要文化联系，但你们不是在和各种叛徒和变节者保持着所谓文化关系吗？如象克拉夫钦科、柯森金娜等等，尽管他们是叛徒和变节者，你们都还是捧他们的场，你们以各种各样的办法用这些恶棍来反对苏联！在这种情形之下，你们要我们和你们保持文化关系吗？奥斯汀先生，请你们先和苏联真正保持文化关系，然后我们再回报你们。
    假如你要我们用舞队来招待你们，你们要我们用我们的音乐家、艺术家、演员、乐队来款待你们，那么，这就需要适当的条件，适当的气氛。但是，现在正缺乏这些条件与气氛，而且，要是你们还把叛徒——苏联的敌人——当作知己的话，将来也还是缺乏这些条件和气氛的。
    我们和各国人民保持着广泛的文化关系，这一点就完全驳倒了你们那种关于什么“铁幕”的骗人的话。
    假如你们对这个问题真正有兴趣的话，你们便会晓得：没有一天没有一些代表团离开苏联到其他国家去，或者一些代表团到苏联来。这些颇为频繁的往来，是在科学与艺术上进行着的，从音乐、舞蹈而至足球及其他各种体育事宜——无所不包。苏联和许多国家保持着这种关系。我可以指出名字来。这些国家就是：波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、阿尔巴尼亚、保加利亚、芬兰、中华人民共和国、意大利、瑞典、德意志民主共和国、比利时、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和巴基斯坦，而苏联作家代表团现在正在参加巴基斯坦进步作家协会大会的工作。这是事实！假如我们派遣我们的代表团，我们的法律工作者、科学家、作家、音乐家前往比利时，前往意大利（尽管这些国家的政府反对我们这些措施），那么，你们又有什么权利说什么“铁幕”，重复戈培尔肮脏的诽谤呢？然而，我们派代表团到那种国家去，我们在那儿被以朋友相待，碰不到克拉夫钦科先生们和你们的其他朋友们，那儿没有人想用各种各样的神话和来历不明的诽谤捏造来诋毁我们。
    奥斯汀先生，在发出这样的诬告之前，要请先仔细思量！因此，奥斯汀先生说什么苏联不想遵循国际往来的常轨，说什么这样就没有表示出谋求国际合作的任何努力的这一番话，便是虚构，这是没有任何根据的。
    主席先生，我要结束我的讲话了。
    我必须说：当麦克奈尔今天放纵他自己说：这是列宁的教义，这是斯大林的教义时，也许这只是他心神激动时的游戏，人们不能跟他认真。难道列宁的教义已经过时？因此你就可以抛弃这一教义了吗？
    我必须说：对这类侮辱的话，我认为不屑一顾。
    我实在不想再说什么苛刻的话了。
    麦克奈尔先生今天用他对科利罗夫寓言的非凡的学问来吓唬我们。很久以前，在私人谈话中，他曾告诉我说：我正在用心地研究你们的科利罗夫寓言。我不久会回答你的。
    我等得不耐烦了，不知他究竟什么时候才会回答。可是今天他回答我了。他引用了一篇现有的英译科利罗夫寓言。翻译得似乎还恰当。这篇寓言的题目叫做“蛇”，这也是麦克奈尔而不是科利罗夫奉送给我的名字。
    按照麦克奈尔的说明，就是说我象一条蛇。我有象蛇一样的毒牙，但是我又象一只夜莺，因为我有婉转的声音。就是能够当一分钟麦克奈尔所说的那种夜莺也是好的。
    那么，在你们面前的就算是一条蛇了。
    寓言总归是寓言，但是我愿意奉劝麦克奈尔先生——假如他回到英国寓言去的话，那也许会好一点，因为那时他就有比较熟悉的根据了。他用科利罗夫的寓言来举例而没有研究这些寓言，结果犯了错误。因为假使麦克奈尔先生以为必须找比喻的话，为求客观起见，他就应该再多搜集并阅读一些寓言。麦克奈尔先生，在你的收藏之中，我今天看过那里有些别的寓言，并且也是关于蛇的。为不负麦克奈尔先生起见，我也愿意引用一个寓言作为回答。
    这个寓言叫做“诽谤者与蛇”。我不愿以自己为任何比喻。麦克奈尔在此地曾说我是一条蛇而有夜莺的歌喉。可是，当我向你们讲这个寓言时，我不说我脑子里想的是谁。你们自己当然会很容易地猜出来。请让我想一下这个寓言。好，现在我们就讲科利罗夫的寓言“诽谤者与蛇”吧。
    这个寓言说：主张恶魔没有正义感的人是很悲哀地错误了。某次，诽谤者与蛇发生争吵，两者都希望当地狱游行的领队，他们争得很厉害，没人愿意让步。最后，他们到魔王那里去解决争端。魔王对蛇说：虽然没有人再比我钦佩你的道德了，但是我要做的决定必须是对诽谤者有利的。我知道你的毒牙可以致人死命，但是，你的毒牙能够象他的舌头那么巧妙地一动就自远处喷出毒液来，高山大海都挡不住吗？因此，他比你更厉害。爬到他背后去，以后谦卑点吧。从此以后，在地狱里，蛇就对诽谤者老老实实地了。
    先生们，我就这样结束吧。我非常感谢在我讲话的时候主席先生只打断我一次，而且是当时是不凑巧。我的话完了。（完）
