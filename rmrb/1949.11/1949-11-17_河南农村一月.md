Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng, 16th. The rural work in Henan Province in October was still mainly focused on suppressing bandits and the anti-despot peasant movement, combined with autumn harvesting, wheat planting, and the deployment of autumn grain requisition work.

After four months of efforts in the province's bandit suppression work, more than 60,000 bandits were eliminated by the end of October. Bandits across the province have been basically eliminated or defeated. Most of the scattered bandits have been captured or forced to surrender, hand in their weapons, and register. The remaining bandits fleeing in the Funiu Mountain area on the border of Henan and Shaanxi and the Dabie Mountain area in southern Henan were also searched and suppressed by the bandit suppression troops in October, eliminating more than 4,100 people in one month.
    
    　　　　Preliminary Consolidation of Rural Positions

By the end of October, the anti-despot movement of peasants in the province had developed to 235 districts in 42 counties (there are 695 districts in 85 counties in the province), and more than 9.2 million peasants in the province have been involved in this movement. In general areas, the anti-despot movement has continued to expand from key breakthroughs to a comprehensive and in-depth level. In the key bandit suppression areas of Shanzhou and Huangchuan, a key anti-despot movement was also launched in October. In the five special districts of Xuchang, Chenliu, Zhengzhou, Shangqiu, and Nanyang, more than 60 districts with a population of 3.01 million have basically completed the anti-despot liquidation movement. Among them, especially in the advanced areas of the peasant movement in Baofeng, Jia County, and Linru, since they had already undergone anti-despot and rent reduction movements in the past, the main task in the autumn was to conduct a review of the counterattacks and escaped despotic landlords. Through review and struggle, they further rectified and developed farmers' association organizations and strengthened the relationship between cadres and the masses. In areas where the anti-despot movement has ended, 25% to 30% of the farmers have been organized. The landlord power factions have been politically defeated and economically weakened. The reactionary armed forces have been completely disarmed. The vast number of farmers have gained the upper hand in the countryside, have farmers' association organizations, and have mastered rural political power, preliminarily consolidating rural positions. At present, more than 23,200 cadres have gone deep into the countryside to carry out work, and the peasant movement will further develop.
    
    　　　　Rectifying Cadre Thinking to Continue Suppressing Bandits and Opposing Despots

However, because some cadres have become complacent due to their existing achievements, there are more or less blind and passive phenomena in the work in various places; at the same time, "leftist" impetuosity has also begun to grow. Therefore, some areas cannot correctly and orderly lead the rising mass emotions, resulting in phenomena such as coercion, commandism, paternalism, ignoring policies, and random beatings and arrests, demonstrating anarchism and lack of discipline. In some areas, after making key breakthroughs, they only focused on developing in all directions and abandoned the original key points, causing the peasant movement in some villages and townships to be usurped or aborted. Based on the above situation, the Henan Military Region Command convened a province-wide bandit suppression work conference from late September to early October, clearly proposing the work guidelines of continuing to eliminate scattered bandits, ferret out hidden bandits, overthrow despots, and mobilize the masses. In mid-October, the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China also convened a mass work conference of key counties in the province to examine the work in various places, so that the guiding ideology of the peasant movement in the future would be clearer, and to define the boundaries of whether various specific policies were correct and the methods of work, seriously criticizing bad work styles such as paternalism, and pointing out the direction for future progress. The military sub-districts and local committees of the Communist Party of China will also convene bandit suppression and mass work conferences and party rectification conferences in their respective regions in November to rectify the thinking of cadres, learn to accurately grasp policies, and consolidate existing rural positions.

Since the beginning of autumn, continuous rain in various parts of Henan has resulted in the failure to complete some autumn harvests in a timely manner, and some autumn fields have been unable to be planted due to water accumulation. After the weather cleared in early October, troops and personnel from various departments immediately helped farmers to rush to harvest and plant, and led the digging of ditches for drainage. The government also helped farmers solve the difficulties of wheat seeds, lending out more than 10 million catties of seeds, and also leading and organizing mutual lending and mutual assistance in an orderly manner, stipulating that all borrowed grain should be returned during the wheat harvest next year. By mid-October, the autumn harvest in the province had been mostly completed, and then they immediately turned to autumn plowing and wheat planting with all their strength. Many areas also implemented simple mutual-aid teams, which solved the difficulties of manpower and animal power. Farmers in Chenliu, Lanfeng, and other counties also squeezed out manpower to reclaim wasteland and increase the area of wheat fields. More than 6 million mu of land flooded in the disaster areas of Shangqiu, Huaiyang, Xuchang, and other six special districts have also been mostly salvaged. The People's Government has also called on and organized disaster victims to grow vegetables for famine relief.

The autumn grain requisition work in the province has also begun to be deployed. The Provincial People's Government has decided to reduce the public grain requisition in the disaster area by 9.2 million catties. Luoyang, Nanqiu, Chenliu, and other special districts have also made appropriate adjustments to the burdens of disaster areas and non-disaster areas. In order to ensure the successful completion of the autumn requisition task, all regions have universally convened representative conferences of all sectors to make arrangements, and the representatives have discussed and summarized the experience of squeezing out black land and implementing reasonable burdens in the summer requisition, and deeply recognized the significance of the autumn requisition work, so that they can carry out extensive publicity among the masses and assist in the autumn requisition after returning. The Provincial People's Government has determined that the autumn requisition work will be the central assault task of the province in November, and will strive to complete it by the end of November.

　　河南农村一月
    【新华社开封十六日电】河南省十月份的农村工作，仍以剿匪和反恶霸的农民运动为主，并结合进行秋收、种麦和布置秋季征粮工作。
    该省的剿匪工作，经过四个月的努力，至十月底共歼匪达六万余人，全省股匪已基本上被消灭或击溃，散匪也大部被捕获或被迫投降、缴枪登记。逃窜于豫陕边境伏牛山区和豫南大别山区的残存股匪，十月中亦经各剿匪部队的努力搜剿，一月内剿灭四千一百余名。
    　　　　农村阵地初步巩固
    全省农民的反恶霸运动，到十月底已发展到四十二个县二百三十五个区（全省共八十五个县六百九十五个区），全省已有九百二十万余农民群众卷入这个运动。在一般地区，反恶霸运动已由重点突破，继续向全面深入扩展。陕州、潢川等重点剿匪区，亦于十月间转入有重点的反恶霸运动。在许昌、陈留、郑州、商邱、南阳等五个专区中，已有六十多个区、三百零一万人口基本上结束了反恶霸清算运动；其中特别是宝丰、郏县、临汝等县农民运动先进地区，由于过去已经过反恶霸和减租运动，秋季主要是向反攻和漏网的恶霸地主展开复查，并通过复查斗争进一步整顿和发展农会组织，密切干部和群众的关系。在反恶霸运动业已结束的地区，已组织起来的农民达百分之二十五到三十，地主当权派在政治上已被打垮，经济上亦被削弱，反动武装已被全部解除，广大农民已在农村中占了优势，有了农民协会的组织，掌握了农村政权，初步巩固了农村阵地。目前全省已有二万三千二百余干部深入农村进行工作，农民运动将进一步发展。
    　　　　整顿干部思想继续肃匪反霸
    但由于某些干部因陶醉于已有的成绩而产生了严重的自满情绪，在各地工作中现在或多或少地存在着盲目和被动现象；同时，“左”倾急性病也开始滋长，因此有些地区不能正确地有秩序地领导高涨的群众情绪，产生了强迫命令、包办代替、不讲政策、乱打乱捕的无政府无纪律等现象。有些地区在重点突破后，只顾向面发展而放弃了原有重点，使某些村乡农民运动被篡夺或流产。根据以上情况，河南军区司令部曾于九月下旬至十月初召开了全省的剿匪工作会议，明确提出继续肃清散匪、抉剔潜匪，打倒恶霸、发动群众的工作方针；十月中旬，中共河南省委也召开了全省重点县的群众工作会议，检查各地的工作，使今后农民运动的指导思想更加明确，定出各种具体政策正确与否的界限和工作方法，严肃地批判了包办代替等恶劣作风，并指出了今后的前进方向。各军分区及中共各地委，亦将于十一月间分别召开所属地区剿匪和群众工作会议及整党会议，整顿干部思想，学习准确地掌握政策，巩固农村已有阵地。
    入秋以来，河南各地阴雨连绵，致部分秋收未能及时完成，有些秋地亦因积水而不能下种。十月初旬天晴后，各地部队和机关人员立即帮助农民抢收抢种，领导挖沟排水。政府并帮助农民解决了麦种困难，除贷出种籽一千余万斤外，并有领导有秩序地发动了互借互济，规定所有借粮于明年麦热时归还。十月中旬全省秋禾已经大部抢收完毕，接着即全力转入秋耕种麦，很多地区并实行简单的变工互助，解决了人力畜力的困难。陈留、兰封等县农民，并挤出人力开垦荒地，增加麦地面积。水灾区商邱、淮阳、许昌等六个专区被淹土地六百余万亩，亦已大部救出，人民政府并号召和组织了灾民种菜备荒。
    本省的秋季征粮工作，亦已开始进行布置，省人民政府决定在灾区减征公粮九百二十万斤。洛阳、南邱、陈留等专区，对灾区和非灾区的负担亦进行了适当的调剂。各地为了保证秋征任务的胜利完成，已普遍召开各界代表会议进行布置，由代表们讨论和总结夏征中挤黑地、贯彻合理负担的经验，并深刻认识秋征工作的意义，以便回去后在群众中进行广泛宣传并协助秋征。省人民政府已确定秋征工作为十一月份全省的中心突击任务，争取于十一月底完成。
