Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 18th. Newspapers in Shanghai and Hankou have published editorials warmly celebrating the opening of the Asian-Australasian Trade Union Conference. The Shanghai Xinwen Ribao, in its editorial on the 16th entitled "The Great Assembly of Eastern Labor Warriors," pointed out: Through this conference, Asian and Australasian labor warriors will further strengthen their ranks, cooperate with brother organizations in other regions under the leadership of the World Federation of Trade Unions, and jointly intensify the struggle for the liberation of the Eastern nations, their own liberation, and the striving for lasting world peace. The editorial said: From now on, the anti-imperialist movement and the anti-aggression war movement of the Eastern nations will surely set off a new upsurge, submerging the imperialists' armed suppression and political conspiracies in the East. The Shanghai Dagong Bao on the 17th stated: This conference is a grand assembly of liberated workers and workers striving for liberation; it is a great unity of workers who have become masters of the country and workers who are still suffering from cruel oppression. This conference is an important step towards achieving social progress and democratic freedom.

The Hankou Dagang Bao, in its editorial on the 16th entitled "The Great Unity of Asian and Australasian Workers," said: The great victory of the Chinese revolution has had an inestimable impact on all oppressed nations in the world, especially the colonial and semi-colonial countries in Asia and Australasia. The role and responsibilities of the Chinese working class in the cause of striving for liberation of the Asian and Australasian working class are undoubtedly also very significant. The Chinese working class should make its greatest efforts to earnestly shoulder the responsibilities it should bear.

  　庆祝亚澳工会会议
    【新华社北京十八日电】上海、汉口的报纸纷纷发表社论，热烈庆祝亚澳工会会议的开幕。上海新闻日报十六日在题为“东方劳动战士大会师”的社论中指出：通过这次会议，亚澳劳工战士将更紧密他们的队伍，配合在世界工联领导下的其他地区的兄弟组织，共同为东方民族的解放、自己的解放和争取世界持久和平而加强战斗。社论说：此后东方民族反帝国主义运动和反侵略战争运动定会掀起新的高潮，把帝国主义在东方的武力镇压和政治阴谋淹没掉。上海大公报十七日称：这一次的会议，是解放了的工人和争取解放中的工人的大会师；是做了国家主人的工人和尚受残酷压迫的工人的大团结。这次会议是达到社会进步和民主自由的重要步骤。
    汉口大刚报十六日在题为“亚澳工人的大团结”的社论中说：中国革命的伟大胜利，给予世界各被压迫民族，特别是亚澳两洲的殖民地、半殖民地国家的影响是不可估量的。中国工人阶级在亚澳工人阶级争取解放事业中所起的作用和应尽的责任，无疑也十分重大。中国工人阶级应该尽其最大的努力，切实担当起她所应负的责任。
