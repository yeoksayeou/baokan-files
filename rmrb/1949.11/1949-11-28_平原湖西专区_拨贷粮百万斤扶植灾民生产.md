　　Plain Lake West Region
  　Allocates 1 Million Jin of Grain Loans to Support Disaster Victims' Production
    [Reported by this newspaper] The Plain Lake West Administrative Office of Pingyuan Province convened a meeting of section chiefs on the 6th of this month to arrange and study future production and disaster relief work.

    The meeting considered that due to drought followed by flooding this year, a regional disaster has been caused. According to incomplete statistics, nearly 100,000 people in the seven counties of the region have fled their homes to escape the famine. Most of these people who have fled are doing so blindly and haphazardly, and as a result, many are returning to their hometowns due to difficulties encountered elsewhere. Based on the above situation, the meeting determined the following guidelines for future production and disaster relief: (1) Strengthen unified leadership of production and disaster relief work and provide timely supervision and inspection. Disaster relief committees will be established in the region and in the severely affected counties and districts such as Yutai and Jiaxiang. (2) Organize disaster victims to engage in production for self-salvation based on different handicraft and sideline industries. To this end, the administrative office has allocated 1 million jin of interest-free grain loans, including 200,000 jin for Yutai, 250,000 jin for Jiaxiang, 150,000 jin for Jinxiang, and 150,000 jin for Juye. Develop cooperative organizations by supporting handicraft and sideline production and developing members. Cooperatives can vigorously organize transportation to help handicraftsmen sell their finished products. In addition, attention should also be paid to leading disaster victims in rushing to plant late wheat and winter plowing. (3) To take care of the difficulties of refugees, the administrative office has issued a notice to all counties and districts to establish disaster relief shelters in villages and towns along the way to help disaster victims solve accommodation and other difficulties. (4) Continue to call on all government offices, troops, schools, and people from all walks of life to promote the spirit of friendship and launch a campaign to save and donate. In non-disaster areas, call on the masses to voluntarily donate a handful of rice, a handful of bran, and a handful of vegetables to support disaster victims.

    In addition, 748 cadres from the Plain Lake West Administrative Office and its subordinate organs enthusiastically responded to the call for donations. In addition to each person saving one tael of millet per day, they also voluntarily donated 8,004 jin of millet, 83 single and lined cotton clothes, 88,600 yuan in Renminbi, 81 pairs of shoes, 17 pairs of socks, and two bed sheets. They have now been collected and distributed to disaster areas.

　　平原湖西专区
  　拨贷粮百万斤扶植灾民生产
    【本报讯】平原省湖西专员公署于本月六日，召开各科局长会议布置与研究今后生产救灾工作。
    会议认为：由于今年先旱后淹，造成了全区性的灾荒。目下灾民外出逃荒者，据不完全统计，全区七个县已近十万人左右，而逃荒户又多系盲目乱逃，结果因出外困难重返故乡者亦不少。根据以上情况会议确定今后生产救灾方针为：（一）加强生产救灾工作的统一领导，及时督促检查。在专署及鱼台、嘉祥等重灾县、区统一成立救灾委员会。（二）组织灾民，根据不同手工业副业基础，进行生产自救。为此，专署特拨无息贷款粮一百万斤，计鱼台二十万斤，嘉祥二十五万斤，金乡十五万斤，钜野十五万斤。从扶植手工业副业生产中，发展社员，建立合作社的组织。合作社可大力组织运输，帮助手工业者推销成品。另外，对领导灾民抢种晚麦、冬耕等工作，亦应同时注意进行。（三）为照顾逃荒难民困难，专署通令各县、区，在沿途村庄、市镇，建立灾民收容所，以帮助灾民解决住宿等困难。（四）继续号召各机关、部队、学校以及各界人士发扬友爱精神，展开节约捐献。在非灾区号召群众自愿捐助一把米、一把糠、一把菜，以支援灾胞。
    另湖西专署级各机关干杂七百四十八人，热烈响应募捐号召，除每人每日节约小米一两外，又自愿捐输小米八千零四斤、单夹棉衣八十三件，人民币八万八千六百元、鞋八十一双，袜子十七双，被单两条。现已集中分拨灾区。
