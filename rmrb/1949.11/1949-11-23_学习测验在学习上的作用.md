The Role of Learning Tests in Learning
　　Hua Da Russian Language Team, Eighth Class Correspondence Group
    Our class held a learning competition in the past two weeks. Before the competition started, in order to understand the students' learning situation and preparation level before the competition, we conducted a class-wide learning test. After the competition started, we conducted two formal tests. From the process of these several tests, we felt that frequent testing is an effective method for checking and promoting learning. Now we have made a preliminary summary of the previous tests and obtained the following experiences.
    Before we conducted the class-wide test, although each learning group also conducted group learning tests separately to check learning, because they were scattered and limited to individual groups, the role they played was not as good as the class-wide test. The class-wide test uses the learning group as the grading unit, playing a role of mutual competition and criticism, and can more widely exchange learning methods and learning tests. But this does not mean that group tests are not important. Group tests are easier to conduct frequently, even once every one or two days. Class-wide tests should be conducted on the basis of group tests. At an appropriate time (one week or two weeks), the scattered tests can be concentrated to conduct a large-scale class-wide learning test in order to receive greater effects.
    The purpose of testing is not only to consolidate learning, but more importantly to check and promote learning. In order to achieve this goal, it is necessary to implement this understanding among the masses, oppose the lack of attention to testing, thinking that "if you have learned well consciously, what else is there to test?" and erroneous views such as simple examination views and individual championshipism. In order to implement the spirit of coming from the masses, before the test, we first let each group propose test focuses, which things are important, which things are easy to make mistakes and neglect, and then the learning group will conduct comprehensive research based on the opinions put forward by everyone, and come up with some more comprehensive questions (including dictation, grammar, sentence making, correction…) to conduct the test. This not only gives everyone a good review opportunity, but also helps to inspire everyone's concern for the test.
    The focus of testing work is mainly on before and after the test. When the test starts, just give everyone a relatively ample time to think carefully.
    After the test, grading should be carried out. Grading should also be done by everyone, that is, adopting the method of democratic grading. This method has many benefits. Grading is a good learning process. Grading must be carried out carefully and responsibly to others. From the grading process, you can know where others and your own mistakes are, why such mistakes occur, and the leadership can also understand the problems existing in learning organization and teaching methods based on the grading summary.
    During grading, the research group should first study: what kind of answers are correct, and what kind of scoring is fair. The answer sheets are exchanged between learning groups for mutual review. The main spirit of grading is not simply scoring, but more importantly correcting errors and deviations, and putting forward suggestions for improvement. Therefore, grading is a mass criticism and self-criticism through specific forms. After the grading is completed, the graders should specifically write down their opinions on the answer sheet, and then the groups should gather together to point out the deviations and achievements of the graded group, so as to understand the general situation of the group and its members. For example, in the previous grading summary, the scores of the members of one group were far apart. One or two people answered very well, but the other students answered very poorly. From this phenomenon, it can be explained that the mutual assistance work of the group is not enough. In addition, some comrades usually have good grades, but their test scores are not good, showing a careless style. This can also explain that his learning attitude is not solid enough. In this way, testing and grading play a great role in checking and promoting learning. The significant effect of the test can be seen from the following statistics. Calculated by the total average score of the whole class: the first time was 67.23. The second time was 76.1. The third time was 80.1. This last time, the monthly exam of the entire Russian language team, our class was 90.55. Now the class administration has concentrated on this experience and stipulated a system of small tests and monthly exams.
    After the grading is completed, each group can hold a review meeting to summarize this experience in order to consolidate achievements, overcome shortcomings, and push learning further forward.

　　学习测验在学习上的作用
　　华大俄文大队第八班通讯组
    我们班在前两周曾搞过学习竞赛。在竞赛没有开始之前，为了解同学们在竞赛前的学习情况与准备程度，曾进行过一次全班的学习测验。竞赛开始后又进行过二次正式测验。从这几次测验的过程中，我们感到经常的进行测验是检查与推动学习的有效方法。现把前几次的测验，初步总结了一下，得到以下一些经验。
    在我们没有搞全班的测验以前，各个学习小组虽然也分别的搞过小组的学习测验来检查学习，但因为是分散的，只限于个别的小组，因此所起的作用，就不如全班的来进行好。全班的测验是以学习小组为评卷单位，起着相互竞赛与批评的作用，能比较广泛地交换学习方法与学习测验。但这并不是说小组的测验是不重要的，小组测验比较易于经常的来进行，甚至一二天便可以举行一次。全班测验是要在小组测验的基础上来进行的，到了一个适当的时期（一个礼拜或二个礼拜），便可把分散的测验集中起来搞一个全班的大规模的学习测验，以求收到更大的效果。
    测验的目的不仅是为了巩固学习，更重要的是为了检查与推动学习。为了达到这个目的，就必须把这种认识贯彻到群众中去，反对对测验不够重视，以为“自觉的学习好了，还测验什么？”和单纯的考试观点、个人锦标主义等错误的看法。为了贯彻从群众中来的精神，我们在测验之前，先让各个小组提出测验重点，那一些东西是重要的，那一些东西是容易搞错和疏忽的，然后学习股再根据大家提出来的意见，加以综合研究，出一些比较全面的题目（包括默写，文法，造句，改错……），来进行测验。这样不仅给大家一个很好的复习机会，而且对于启发大家对测验的关心，也是有帮助的。
    测验工作的重点主要放在测验前后，当测验开始时，只要给大家一个比较充裕的时间，好好地思索。
    测验完了以后接着便该进行评卷。评卷也要由大家来干，即是采取民主评卷的方法。这个方法有许多好处，通过评卷就是一个很好的学习。评卷是要对别人负责而要慎重进行的，从评卷的过程中可以知道别人和自己的错误在那些地方，为什么会发生这样的错误，在领导上也可以根据评卷的总结了解学习组织，教学方法上存在的问题。
    评卷时先由研究小组研究一下：怎样的答题才是正确的，怎样的评分才是公平的。答卷由各个学习小组互相交换评阅，评卷的主要精神不是单纯的评分，更重要的是纠正错误和偏向，及提出改进的意见。因此评卷便是一个群众性的通过具体形式的批评与自我批评。评完以后评卷人要具体地写出对这份卷子的意见，然后再由小组集中起来，指出被评卷小组的偏向与成绩，这样便了解该小组及其组员的一般情况。如在前次评卷总结里，有一个小组组员的成绩相差较远，一二个人答得很好，但其他的同学答的很差；从这个现象里，就可以说明该小组的互助工作不够。另外有的同志平常的成绩不错，但是测验的成绩却不好，表现出粗枝大叶的作风。这也可以说明他在学习态度上还不够踏实。这样通过测验及评卷，对于检查与推动学习是起着很大的作用。从下列统计中便可看出测验的显著效果。以全班总平均分数来计算：第一次六七·二三。第二次七六·一。第三次八○·一。最后这一次全俄文大队的月考，我们班是九○·五五。现在班行政集中了这一经验，规定了小考及月考的制度。
    评卷完了以后，各个小组可以召开检讨会，总结这一经验，以便巩固成绩，克服缺点，把学习再向前推进一步。
