Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 21st: According to TASS, New York: The UN General Assembly plenary session on the 16th discussed and voted on the report submitted by the General Assembly's Second Committee (Economic and Financial Committee) regarding assistance to the economic development of backward countries. The committee recommended the adoption of the plan formulated by the United Nations Economic and Social Council to provide technical assistance to backward countries, instructed the Economic and Social Council to continue studying this issue, and recommended that the Economic and Social Council be responsible for studying international economic and trade policies that may affect the economic development process of backward countries. The final recommendation was proposed by the Polish delegation and was adopted by a majority in the Second Committee. However, the Polish proposal was opposed by the colonial countries of the United States, Britain, and France in the plenary session.

At the beginning of the meeting, representatives from Peru, Bolivia, and other countries in the US-British bloc claimed that the economies of backward countries needed private investment and preemptively expressed their agreement to create the most favorable conditions for new US investment in these countries. Soviet representative Arutyunyan spoke, refuting these claims, saying that the United States' policy of attempting to prevent the development of national industries in backward countries and seize their markets was enough to explain why the United States and countries that blindly follow it were so opposed to the Polish proposal, especially the point that backward countries must implement protectionist tariff policies to establish and develop their national industries.

Arutyunyan then referred to the claim that the economies of so-called backward countries need private investment, stating that if the purpose of investment is to improve the living standards of the people in backward countries, then investors should first pay attention to the poverty within their own countries. In fact, capital export is by no means determined by this motive, but because the domestic situation in the countries exporting capital is not good and investment is unfavorable, so they want to invest capital in other countries to pursue greater profits. According to the latest data, in 1947, US private investment abroad amounted to 16.7 billion US dollars. Arutyunyan pointed out that the delegations of several countries are attempting to use the United Nations to create favorable conditions for the United States to export capital, and have already begun to talk about the need for international security for private capital invested in other countries.

During the vote, the General Assembly adopted the report of the Second Committee, but the part of the proposal submitted by the Polish delegation was rejected by a slim majority (21 votes to 20) manipulated by the US, British, and French bloc.

　　联大讨论援助落后国家经济发展报告
　　苏联代表亚鲁疆发言     
    斥美帝掠夺市场阴谋
    【新华社北京二十一日电】据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会十六日的全体会议讨论并表决了大会第二委员会（经济及财政委员会）提出的关于援助落后国家经济发展的报告。该委员会建议通过联合国经济社会理事会所拟定的计划，给落后国家以技术援助，责成经社理事会继续研究这一问题，并建议经社理事会负责研究可能影响落后国家经济发展过程的国际经济与贸易政策的问题。最后的建议是由波兰代表团所提出，并经第二委员会多数通过的。但波兰的建议在全体会议中遭到了美、英、法诸殖民国家的反对。
    会议开始时，秘鲁、玻利维亚和其他美英集团一些国家的代表就声称落后国家的经济需要私人投资，并预先表示同意在这些国家内为美国的新投资创设最有利的条件。苏联代表亚鲁疆发言驳斥这种言论说：美国力图阻止落后国家民族工业的发展并夺取其市场的政策，就足以说明美国和唯美国之命是听的国家为什么要如此反对波兰的建议，特别是反对其中所说落后国家必需实行保护关税政策，以建立与发展其民族工业的一点。
    亚鲁疆接着提到所谓落后国家的经济需要私人投资的说法称：如果投资的目的在提高落后国家人民的生活水准，那么投资者首先就应该注意他们自己国内的贫困现象。事实上，资本输出绝非由这种动机所决定的，而是因为输出资本的国家的国内情况不好，投资不利，所以要把资本投到其他国家，以追求更大的利润。根据最新材料，在一九四七年，美国对国外的私人投资为数达一百六十七亿元。亚鲁疆指出，若干国家的代表团企图利用联合国，来创造美国向外输出资本的有利条件，并且已经为此开始谈论投在其他国家的私人资本需要国际安全的问题。
    在举行表决时，大会通过了第二委员会的报告，但其中由波兰代表团所提出的建议部分，却被美、英、法集团操纵下的微弱的多数（二十一票对二十票）所否决。
