Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 23rd: The following is the full text of the speech given by Liu Shaoqi, Vice Chairman of the Central People's Government and Honorary Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, at today's Beijing People from All Walks of Life Celebration Meeting for the Success of the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference:

　　Comrade Workers of the Capital! Comrade Students! Comrade Staff and Commanders and Fighters of All Agencies!

　　Today you are holding a meeting to celebrate the success of the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference and to welcome the members of the Executive Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions and the worker representatives from Europe, America, Asia, and Africa. Your actions are entirely correct. The Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference has achieved its due success and is about to establish the Asian-Australian Liaison Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions. From now on, organized and unorganized workers in Asian and Australian countries can unite with each other through this liaison bureau, and unite with workers in other countries around the world through the World Federation of Trade Unions. This creates a condition in which the organized actions of workers in various countries can mutually assist and cooperate with each other, and thus be able to more effectively fight against the reactionary forces of imperialism in the world. This kind of mutual assistance and cooperation in the actions of the working class in the international arena is very important, because the oppression of the working class and the people of colonial and semi-colonial countries by imperialism is not an isolated phenomenon within a single country, but a phenomenon within an international scope. If the actions of the working class do not have mutual assistance and cooperation in the international arena, they cannot effectively strike at imperialism. And if there is such mutual assistance and cooperation, the speed of development of the revolutionary movement will be greatly accelerated. The establishment of the Asian-Australian Liaison Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions has created convenient conditions for the mutual assistance and cooperation in action between the working classes of Asian and Australian countries and the working class of the world.

　　Comrades! The members of the Executive Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions and the worker representatives from various countries who are here today to receive your welcome are the ones to whom you—the workers, staff, students, and commanders and fighters of China—should express your deep gratitude. Because they are the leaders of the world labor movement, the true representatives of the working classes of various countries, the direction they represent is the common direction of the working class and progressive people all over the world, they have a true spirit of internationalism, and they have had deep sympathy for the struggle of the Chinese working class and the Chinese people for liberation since a long time ago, and have taken various actions to provide assistance. They launched various struggles against imperialism and its running dogs from Europe, America, Asia, Australia, and Africa, from the socialist Soviet Union, from various new democratic countries, from capitalist countries, and from colonial and semi-colonial countries, to assist the Chinese revolution, restrained a great force of imperialism and its running dogs, and thus enabled the Chinese working class and the Chinese people to defeat imperialism and its running dog, the Kuomintang reactionaries, and achieve today's victory. And without the assistance they launched in various aspects, as Comrade Mao Zedong said: the Chinese people could not have won victory, and it would not be possible to consolidate it even if they had won. For this reason, we—the workers, staff, students, and commanders and fighters of China—should deeply express our gratitude to them—the leaders and representatives of the working classes of the world! And we hope that they will convey our gratitude to the worker brothers of all countries in the world!

　　Comrades! The Chinese working class and the Chinese people, through their own hard work and the hard-working assistance of international friends, have basically achieved victory against imperialism and its running dog, the Kuomintang reactionaries. The Chinese working class is a victorious working class. Many laws protecting the working class have been announced, the phenomenon of enslaving workers is no longer possible, the working class can freely organize its own trade unions, and the laws prohibiting workers from engaging in political activities have been abolished. This means that the Chinese working class has gained all political freedoms and has gained a leading position in the state power. This enables the Chinese working class to unite all the working people in the country and rely on their own labor to create a happy life for themselves in the future. Comrades! At this time, you should firmly remember what Lenin said: The more victories the working class wins, the greater the responsibilities it is required to bear. The Chinese working class has won a great victory, therefore, the responsibilities borne by the Chinese working class have also been greatly increased. That is to say, in addition to shouldering the heavy leadership responsibility of restoring the economy and improving production in the country, the Chinese working class also has to shoulder the heavy responsibility of assisting the working classes and laboring people of various capitalist countries, especially the colonial and semi-colonial countries of Asia and Australia, internationally . The victorious Chinese working class cannot and should not shirk such international responsibilities. We should give the working classes and laboring people in those countries ruled by capitalism and imperialism who need assistance all kinds of spiritual and material assistance. This is a glorious responsibility. The Chinese working class should have a full spirit of internationalism and cheerfully and sincerely shoulder this responsibility. The establishment of the Asian-Australian Liaison Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions in China provides the Chinese working class with convenient opportunities to shoulder this glorious international responsibility.

　　Comrades! The Chinese working class and the Chinese people have already obtained and will continue to obtain all the victories that can be obtained in the current historical period, and all the heavy international and domestic responsibilities also require us to shoulder; however, at present, we still have many difficulties. Generally speaking, your salaries have not increased, your material treatment has not improved, and it is temporarily impossible to have many increases and improvements. Not only that, but the price fluctuations in recent times have hit the lives of the vast majority of the people, especially you salaried workers, quite hard. Your trade union workers and government workers are fully aware of the difficulties in your lives. The emergence of these difficult situations can certainly prove that there are still many shortcomings in our work, but the basic reason for the difficulties is not here, but because we have just won victory, and unprecedented military operations are proceeding at a speed that surpasses all in history. Millions of troops are advancing almost daily at a speed of dozens or even more than a hundred miles, regardless of all difficulties. The government's military expenditures are unprecedentedly huge, and the liberated areas have not had time to be reorganized due to the destruction of the enemy in the past. And these are the main reasons for the price fluctuations and the many difficulties you are experiencing. This winter may be the most difficult winter for you. Some of your wives may still have to endure some freezing and starvation. Chairman Mao and the responsible staff of the government are extremely concerned about your suffering and are actively trying to overcome it. The Central People's Government will soon convene a meeting to discuss major issues related to people's lives. We believe that under the correct leadership of the Central People's Government and with the joint efforts of the entire working class and the entire people, all difficulties can be overcome one by one, your lives can be gradually improved, and prices can be stabilized. In about a year, you may not have as many difficulties as you have today, and your lives may be better.

　　This is the goal of our—the government and the entire people—joint efforts and struggles. Without everyone's efforts, without a struggle that disregards one's own safety, good hopes will not become reality. Therefore, we hope that workers, peasants, staff of all agencies, engineers and technicians, commanders and fighters at the front and in the rear, and patriotic industrialists and businessmen, will contribute your labor and wisdom and the capital that can be utilized in order to overcome the current difficulties and create a happy life in the future. Increase production as quickly as possible, restore the economy, save raw materials, oppose waste, oppose idleness and phenomena that do not comply with labor discipline, and oppose bureaucracy in production management, in order to increase wealth and reduce expenses for the country and society. Employees of certain factories and agencies who do not have work or have very little work, after receiving the state's salary, should not be idle or half-idle, but should discuss with each other under the leadership of the government and economic agencies to carry out certain beneficial temporary work, such as: constructing public works, repairing water conservancy projects, and other work that can increase social wealth and reduce national expenditures. Comrade peasants, should actively prepare for the spring plowing next year, so that more grain, industrial raw materials, and other products can be produced next year. The government is preparing to produce from cities and import many items needed by farmers from foreign countries to exchange for the grain and raw materials produced by farmers. Comrades in various agencies, schools, and the army should always pay attention to saving, oppose waste, oppose all irresponsible phenomena, and try to carry out production under the conditions that do not hinder work, study, and combat. Only in this way, only when the entire people make appropriate and concerted efforts in their respective positions, can our difficulties be overcome more quickly. In general, the Central People's Government and the people's governments at all levels under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong are very valuable to all the fruits of the people's labor, and will be good at using the wealth created by the people to overcome the people's current difficulties and create future happiness, and will not waste the fruits of the people's labor in any way. The year 1950 may be the last year of our difficulties. By gritting our teeth and getting through this year, and with the united efforts of the government and the masses of the people, we may gradually enter a better state.

　　Comrades! If our difficulties can be overcome more quickly, if the production of our country can be increased more quickly, if the economy can be restored more quickly, and if the victories we have won can be consolidated more quickly, then we will be more able to shoulder our international responsibilities, and we will be more able to encourage the people of those oppressed countries to rise up and fight for their own liberation. These are what we can do and should do.

　　In order to overcome our own difficulties, in order to create our future happy life, in order to shoulder our international responsibilities, and in order to celebrate the success of the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference, and in order to welcome the leaders and representatives of our international working class, let us contribute our labor and wisdom! Do our work better! Increase social productivity even higher! Save our national expenses even more! In this way, we can achieve complete victory and consolidate our victory, we can promote the people's movement in Asian and Australian countries to develop further and enable them to achieve victory.

　　北京各界庆祝亚澳工会会议成功大会上
　　刘少奇副主席讲话全文
    【新华社北京二十三日电】中央人民政府副主席和中华全国总工会名誉主席刘少奇在今日北京各界人民庆祝亚澳工会会议成功大会上讲话全文如下：
    首都的工人同志们！学生同志们！各机关的工作人员和指挥员战斗员同志们！
    今天你们举行大会来庆祝亚澳工会会议的成功，欢迎世界工会联合会执行局各委员以及从欧洲、美洲、亚洲、非洲各国来的工人代表们，你们的行动是完全正确的。亚澳工会会议，已经获得应有的成功，即将建立世界工联的亚澳联络局。从今以后，亚澳各国有组织的及无组织的工人们，都可经过这个联络局而互相联合起来，并经过世界工联与世界各国的工人们联合起来。这就造成了一种条件，使各国工人们的有组织的行动，能够相互援助与相互配合，因而就能够更有力地去和世界上的反动势力帝国主义进行斗争。工人阶级的行动，在国际间的这种相互援助与相互配合，是很重要的，因为帝国主义对于工人阶级的压迫，对于殖民地半殖民地人民的压迫，都不是一国范围内的单独的现象，而是一种国际范围内的现象，工人阶级的行动如果没有国际间的相互援助与相互配合，就不能有力地打击帝国主义。而如果有了这种相互援助与相互配合，革命运动发展的速度，就会要大大地加快起来。由于世界工联亚澳联络局的成立，就为亚澳各国工人阶级与世界工人阶级在行动上的相互援助与相互配合，造成了一种便利的条件。
    同志们！今天在这里接受你们欢迎的世界工联执行局各委员和各国的工人代表们，是你们——中国的工人、职员、学生和指挥员战斗员应该向他们深致谢意的。因为他们是世界工人运动的领袖，是各国工人阶级的真正的代表，他们所代表的方向，是全世界工人阶级和进步人民的共同的方向，他们具有真正的国际主义精神，他们对中国工人阶级和中国人民争取解放的斗争，很早以来，就抱着深厚的同情，并采取了各种行动来加以援助。他们从欧洲、美洲、亚洲、澳洲及非洲各国，从社会主义的苏联，从各新民主国家，从资本主义各国，从各殖民地半殖民地国家发动了反对帝国主义及其走狗的各种各样的斗争，来援助中国革命，牵制了帝国主义及其走狗的很大的力量，因而就使得中国工人阶级和中国人民能够战胜帝国主义及其走狗国民党反动派，取得了今天的胜利。而如果没有他们所发动的各方面的援助，正如毛泽东同志所说：中国人民是不能胜利的，胜利了，要巩固，也是不可能的。由于这样的原因，我们——中国的工人、职员、学生和指挥员战斗员应该向他们——世界各国工人阶级的领袖和代表深深地表示我们的谢意！我们并且希望他们把我们的这种谢意转达给世界各国的工人兄弟们！
    同志们！我们中国的工人阶级和人民在自己的努力奋斗和国际友人的努力援助之下，我们业已在基本上取得反对帝国主义及其走狗国民党反动派的胜利。中国的工人阶级是已经胜利了的工人阶级，保护工人阶级的许多法令已经宣布了，奴役工人的现象已经不可能存在了，工人阶级可以自由地组织自己的工会，禁止工人从事政治活动的法令被废除了。这就是说，中国工人阶级已经获得了一切政治自由，并已取得了对于国家政权的领导地位。这就使得中国工人阶级能够团结国内一切劳动人民，倚靠自己的劳动，去创造自己未来的幸福的生活。同志们！你们在这种时候应该牢牢地记住列宁所说过的一句话：工人阶级所得的胜利越多，所要求于它担负的责任也越大。中国工人阶级得到了伟大的胜利，因此，中国工人阶级所担负的责任也就大大地加重了。这就是说，中国工人阶级除开在国内要担负恢复经济、提高生产的繁重的领导责任之外，在国际上还要担负援助世界各资本主义国家特别是亚洲；澳洲各殖民地半殖民地国家的工人阶级和劳动人民的繁重的责任。胜利了的中国工人阶级，对于这样一种国际责任，是不能而且也不应该推脱的，我们应该给那些需要援助的被资本主义和帝国主义统治的国家内的工人阶级和劳动人民以精神的和物质的各种援助。这是一种光荣的责任。中国工人阶级应该具有充分的国际主义的精神，愉快地诚恳地来担负这种责任。世界工联亚澳联络局设在中国，这就给中国工人阶级担负这种光荣的国际责任以便利的机会。
    同志们！中国工人阶级和中国人民业已获得并还将继续获得在目前历史时期所能够获得的一切胜利，国际的和国内的一切繁重责任也要求我们去担负；但是，在目前，我们的困难还是很多的。一般地说来，你们的薪资并没有增加，你们的物质待遇并没有改善，而且暂时也不可能有很多的增加和改善。不仅如此，在最近期间几次物价的波动，使绝大多数的人民、特别是你们薪资劳动者的生活，受到了不小的打击。你们生活上的困难，你们的工会工作者和政府工作者是完全了解的。你们这些困难情况的产生，固然可以证明在我们的工作中还有不少的缺点，但困难的基本原因，还不在这里，还是由于我们刚刚取得胜利，而且空前规模的军事行动正以超越历史上所有的速度进行着，数百万军队不顾一切困难几乎每日都以几十里以至一百多里的速度在前进，政府的军费开支是从来未有的浩大，解放了的地区，由于过去敌人的破坏，也还没有来得及整理。而这些就是物价波动以及你们许多困难产生的主要原因。今年的冬天，可能是你们最困难的一个冬天，你们的妻子，有一些人还可能要忍受一些冻饿。毛主席和政府的负责工作人员对于你们这些困苦抱着极大的关怀，并在积极地设法加以克服，中央人民政府即将召集会议来讨论关涉人民生活的重大问题。我们相信，在中央人民政府的正确领导之下，在全体工人阶级和全体人民的共同努力之下，一切困难是能够一个一个地加以克服的，你们的生活是能够逐渐地加以改善的，物价也能够平稳，再有一年左右的时间，你们就可能没有今天这样多的困难，你们的生活就可能比较地要好一些。
    这是我们——政府和全体人民共同努力奋斗的目标。没有大家的努力，没有奋不顾身的斗争，好的希望是不会变为现实的。因此，我们盼望工人们、农民们、各机关的工作人员和工程师、技师们、前线和后方的指挥员与战斗员们、爱国的工商业家们，为了克服当前的困难与创造将来的幸福生活，把你们的劳动和智慧以及可以利用的资本贡献出来，尽可能迅速地提高生产，恢复经济，节省原料，反对浪费，反对怠惰及不遵守劳动纪律的现象，反对生产管理上的官僚主义，以便为国家为社会增加财富和减少开支。某些没有工作或工作很少的工厂和机关的员工，在领取了国家的薪资之后，不应该白闲着或半闲着，而应该在政府和经济机关的领导之下大家商讨出办法来进行某些有益的临时性工作，例如：建筑公共工程，修整水利，以及其他可以增加社会财富、减少国家开支的工作。农民同志们，应该积极准备明年的春耕，以便明年能生产更多的粮食、工业原料及其他产品，政府准备从城市中生产，并从国外进口农民所需用的许多物品来交换农民所生产的粮食和原料。各机关、各学校、以及军队中的同志们，应该经常注意节省，反对浪费，反对一切不负责任的现象，并在不妨害工作、学习和战斗的条件下设法进行生产。只有如此，只有全体人民在各人的岗位上适当地进行一致的努力，我们的困难就能更快地克服。总的说来，在毛泽东主席领导下的中央人民政府和各级人民政府是十分珍贵一切人民的劳动成果的，是会善于利用人民创造出来的财富去克服人民当前的困难和创造将来的幸福的，是不会把人民的劳动成果作任何虚掷的。一九五○年，可能是我们困难的最后一年，咬紧牙关渡过这一年，并有政府和人民大众团结一致的努力，我们就可能逐渐地进入佳境。
    同志们！我们的困难如果能够更快地克服，我们国家的生产如果能够更快地提高，经济能够更快地恢复，我们已争得的胜利能够更快地巩固起来，那我们就更加能够担负我们的国际责任，就更能鼓励那些被压迫国家的人民起来斗争，争取他们自己的解放。这些就是我们大家能够作和应该作的。
    为了克服我们自己的困难，为了创造我们将来的幸福生活，为了担负我们的国际责任，为了庆祝亚澳工会会议的成功，为了欢迎我们国际工人阶级的领袖和代表，而贡献我们的劳动和智慧吧！把我们的工作作得更好一些！把社会的生产力提得更高一些！把我们国家的开支更节省一些！这样，我们就能取得完全的胜利并巩固我们的胜利，我们就能推动亚澳各国的人民运动更加向前发展并使他们取得胜利。
