　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 31st: TASS Moscow, October 29th: The second part of the international commentary, prominently published in today's Izvestia, comments on the London meeting of American diplomats. The commentator wrote that the British Peace Congress has protested the meeting of American diplomats who ran to London from the embassies of the People's Democratic countries and the Soviet Union to discuss the issue of intensifying war preparations. The resolution of the Congress states that at a time when Britain is becoming an atomic bomb base, this meeting is a new step by the United States in preparing for a third world war and a greater threat to our national independence.

　　The commentator said that the US State Department, with rare high-handedness, arrogantly disregarded the national self-esteem of France and Britain, holding its diplomatic meetings in the capitals of these countries—Paris and London—as if they were in their own homes.

　　The American ambassadors and special envoys to the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria attended the meeting of American diplomats (the “experts” on Russian and Eastern European affairs). The meeting was held in London on October 24th and 25th, presided over by US Assistant Secretary of State Perkins. Sitting side by side with the about-to-resign US Ambassador to Yugoslavia, Cannon, was his successor, Allen. Paul Nitze, former “Russian problem” consultant to the State Department, Averell Harriman, former US Ambassador to the Soviet Union and executor of the Marshall Plan for Western Europe for the US government, and McCloy, the US High Commissioner for West Germany, were also invited to attend the meeting. Some newspapers and news agencies clearly stated that the reason American diplomats were summoned to London for a meeting was due to the obvious failure of the American spy agencies in the People’s Democratic countries.

　　The US State Department was alarmed by this. Similarly, despite the subversive activities carried out by American special agents in the People's Democratic countries, one can still see "astonishing economic development," "increasing political stability," and the growing prestige of the Communist Party and the working class in these countries. The Tel-Aviv News Agency reported that all of this will be announced in a special report prepared by the State Department. This report is also forced to admit that the people's friendship and trust in the Soviet Union is growing, and they are convinced that "it is the United States that dreams of war, while the Soviet Union defends peace."

　　The commentator continued, according to Reuters, the issue of further US aid to the bankrupt fascist bandit Tito was one of the main agenda items discussed at the meeting. After the espionage and sabotage activities of the American imperialist shock troops in Yugoslavia in the People's Democratic countries were exposed, this gang of special agents and assassins in Belgrade was no longer able to play the role of a secret agency for Wall Street. They have become open mercenaries of the warmongers and have repeatedly played a despicable role in the warmongers’ provocative anti-Soviet policies.

　　What are the characteristics of the discussion on the issue of aid to Tito at the London meeting of American diplomats? This can be measured according to the news immediately disseminated by the United Press after the meeting. According to this news, Tito proposed the issue of Yugoslavia formally joining the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty.

　　In addition to the issue involving the failure of the American agency—Yugoslavia—in the Eastern European countries, according to British newspapers, American diplomats also discussed the German issue, because the establishment of the German Democratic Republic—a turning point in European history—was the heaviest blow to the American policy of splitting Germany.

　　The commentator concluded that therefore, the convening of the London meeting of American diplomats was due to the obvious failure of American policy in the Eastern European countries and Germany. This policy, which initially became known as the "Cold War" policy, is constantly suffering failures.

　　伦敦美外交人员会议是挑动战争的新步骤
  　消息报发表评论揭露
    【新华社北京三十一日电】塔斯社莫斯科二十九日讯：以显要地位刊载于今日消息报上的国际评述的第二部分，评论伦敦美国外交人员的会议。评论员写道，，英国的和平大会，已对由人民民主国家及苏联等国的大使馆跑到伦敦去讨论加紧战争准备问题的美国外交人员的会议，提出抗议。大会的决议说，在英国正变为原子弹基地之时，这一会议乃是美国准备第三次世界大战新步骤，和对我们的国家独立的更大的威胁。
    评论员说，美国国务院以罕见的高压手段，傲慢地蔑视法国和英国的民族自尊，在这些国家的首都——巴黎和伦敦召开其外交人员会议，好象是在他们家里一样。
    美国驻苏联、波兰、捷克、匈牙利、罗马尼亚与保加利亚的大使和特使，参加了美国外交人员（俄国和东欧事务“专家”）的会议。会议于十月二十四日与二十五日在伦敦举行，由美国助理国务卿柏金斯主持。和行将辞职的美国驻南斯拉夫大使加农并排相坐的，还有其继任人艾伦。国务院前“俄罗斯问题”顾问波伦、前美国驻苏大使与美国政府马歇尔计划西欧执行人哈里曼及美国驻西德高级专员麦克洛埃，也被邀出席这一会议。一些报纸和通讯社明白地说，美国外交人员所以被召到伦敦开会，是由于美国在人民民主国家的间谍机关遭到显明的失败。
    美国国务院对这件事感到惊慌失措。同样地还由于：尽管美国特务在人民民主国家从事各种颠覆性活动，可是，在这些国家中仍可看到“惊人的经济发展”、“日益增长的政治稳定”、共产党及工人阶级的日益增长的威信。电通社报道，这一切都要在国务院准备的特别报告中宣布。这一报告也被迫承认各国人民对苏联的友好和信任正日益增长，他们确信“梦想战争的是美国，而苏联则保卫着和平”。
    评论员继称，根据路透社的消息，美国进一步援助破产的法西斯匪徒铁托的问题，是上述会议曾经讨论过的主要议程之一。当美帝国主义的南斯拉夫突击队在人民民主国家中所进行的间谍与破坏活动被揭露之后，贝尔格莱德的这一特务与刺客匪帮，已不再能扮演华尔街的秘密代理机关的角色了。他们已变成战争贩子公开的雇佣兵，并且一再在战争贩子的挑衅的反苏政策中扮演着可鄙的角色。
    伦敦美国外交人员会议上有关援助铁托问题的讨论有什么特点呢？这可以根据合众社在会议结束后立即散布的消息予以测量。根据这一消息，铁托提出了使南斯拉夫正式参加侵略性北大西洋公约的问题。
    除了涉及美国的代理机关——南斯拉夫——在东欧国家的失败的问题之外，根据英国报纸的消息，美国外交人员还讨论了德国问题，因为德意志民主共和国的成立——欧洲历史的转折点——使美国在德国的分裂政策遭到最沉重的打击。
    评论员结语说，因此，伦敦美外交人员会议的召开，是由于美国的政策在东欧国家及德国遭到显明的失败。这一开始以“冷战”政策闻名的政策正在不断遭受失败。
