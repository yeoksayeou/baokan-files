　　Regarding the Vietnamese Trade Union Movement
  　Summary of Report by Liu Defu, Chief Delegate of the Vietnamese Delegation
    The liberation movement of the Vietnamese working class is linked to the struggle of the Vietnamese people for genuine independence, unity, and people's democracy. The long and arduous armed struggle gave rise to the current organizational form of the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor and determined its tasks. The Vietnamese working class once led the Vietnamese people in a military struggle against French imperialism. The Vietnamese Liberation Army was continuously replenished with spoils captured from enemy forces by guerrilla attacks and weapons produced by local factories to supplement those increasingly numerous troops. Thus, in four years, the Vietnamese military force has become strong enough to resist the enemy and lay the foundation for future victory.

    In this struggle, the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor considered mobilizing workers to support the war as its primary task. The conscious working class worked with unprecedented diligence to support the front lines. Moreover, they responded to the call of the trade union and collectively joined the army. Workers account for 10 percent of the army. In addition, "Saigon Assault Team," "Hanoi Highway Automatic Defense Regiment," "Haiphong Ho Chi Minh Regiment," and other units were formed.

    In enemy enterprises, workers carried out sabotage, attacking and burning enemy warehouses, factories, and farms.

    In the reconstruction of the liberated areas, the first task to be proposed was the relocation of factories by workers. Our workers often used the most primitive methods, under the cover of residents and darkness, to transport machines weighing several tons. After completing this task, the next issue was to build and defend the factories. These factories had to be dispersed in several places, support each other, and change locations periodically. Workers had to be armed, receive military training, and defend the factories. Thanks to the efforts and advocacy of the workers, every province now has an arsenal. In all factories, production is increasing daily. In 1948, production increased by 60 percent compared to the previous year, and in the third year, production doubled.

    The workers' enthusiasm for labor not only proves that they understand their role in the national liberation movement, but also demonstrates their position in various enterprises. The working class and its organization, the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor, have worked hard to help build these factories. Workers have become the real masters of the enterprises. In many factories, they elect their own outstanding representatives as managers, and everyone jointly supervises production and protects the factories.

    On the issue of improving workers' lives, the task of the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor is very difficult. On the one hand, it is necessary to mobilize workers to increase production, and on the other hand, to do everything possible to ensure them better living and working conditions. In order to meet the needs of the army and residents, the working day was increased from eight to nine hours based on the proposals of the workers' congress of each factory. Currently, efforts are gradually being made in all factories to improve workers' supply of food reserves and build comfortable housing. The United Trade Union pays attention to organizing workers' collective life in the best way, and the government provides them with all conveniences in this regard. Trade unions have organized public canteens, conference halls, libraries, gymnasiums, etc.

    In enemy-occupied areas, the situation of workers is completely different. There, workers live in extreme hardship, forced to work twelve to fourteen hours a day. Child laborers aged ten to sixteen do the same work as adults, but their wages are only half of those of adult workers. Workers in enemy-occupied areas cannot endure such a painful life, and they unite more closely with the workers in the liberated areas of the Republic of Vietnam. The Vietnam General Confederation of Labor helps with the organizational work of workers in enemy-occupied areas, sends its own staff there, and supports them with all materials. Their secret organizations have been developing day by day.

    The Vietnamese working class has made great sacrifices for the liberation of the nation. The Vietnam General Confederation of Labor, as the leading organ of the working class, has made great efforts. However, it must be admitted that it still has many shortcomings.

    1. The working class has not yet enjoyed all the rights it should enjoy.
    2. The Vietnam General Confederation of Labor has not been able to ensure that it has sufficient cadres and materials.
    3. The isolated position of the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor hinders its establishment of normal relations with the international working class.
    4. In terms of organization, the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor has not yet united the majority of intellectual workers (journalists, educators, etc.) into its ranks.

    The Vietnamese working class is waging a heroic struggle, but the real labor movement is still weak. In this regard, it needs the support of foreign countries, especially brotherly countries in Asia with rich experience in struggle.

    In order to make our future tasks clearer, we would like to put forward the following points for discussion at the conference.

    (1) The relationship between trade unions and the national liberation movement. In many countries in Asia, the working class suffers from the triple oppression of capitalism, feudalism, and nationalism. Therefore, a trade union movement that is divorced from the national liberation movement is impossible. The working class fighting for liberation should help the peasants fighting against the feudal system, and should strengthen the alliance between workers and peasants; otherwise, victory is impossible.

    (2) Our attitude towards the "Mutual Assistance Plan for Culturally Backward Countries" of the American imperialists. The organization of the Asian-Australian Trade Union Congress should now firmly oppose this plan. Trade unions should point out to workers that this plan is extremely detrimental to the interests of workers and the national liberation movement.

    (3) Trade union organization issues. Imperialists are using force and divisive tactics to undermine trade unions. They use the differences between workers of different nationalities in the same region to alienate workers' unity. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the unity between workers of various nationalities, and to do everything possible to ensure contact with the World Federation of Trade Unions. The soon-to-be-established Asia-Australian Liaison Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions can undertake this task.

    (4) Contact between workers in oppressor countries and oppressed countries. Workers in imperialist countries should do their best to assist workers in all oppressed countries, but trade unions must find ways to make workers understand that this assistance is limited. We propose that the World Federation of Trade Unions establish a larger working team to provide spiritual and material assistance to countries in arduous struggle.

    Regarding Vietnam, we make the following requests:

    1. Workers in the areas of Kâmpŭchea (i.e., Cambodia) and Lạng Sơn are fighting together with the people against French colonialism. We propose that the conference instruct the liaison bureau to study the labor movements in these two regions, and hope to help them establish their own organizations and support their struggles.
    2. We propose that representatives of the World Federation of Trade Unions visit our liberated areas. The Vietnamese working class hopes that this will be a sign of the great unity of international workers, which will bring a new spirit of proletarian internationalism to the Vietnamese working class.

　　关于越南工会运动
  　越南代表团首席代表刘德福报告摘要
    【新华社北京二十一日电】参加亚澳工会会议的越南代表团首席代表刘德福在昨日的大会上报告越南工会运动。要点如下：
    越南工人阶级解放运动与越南人民的争取真正独立统一与人民民主的斗争联系在一起的。长期艰难的武装斗争，产生了越南总工会现在的组织形式，并且决定了它的任务。越南的工人阶级曾经领导越南人民进行了反抗法国帝国主义的军事斗争。越南解放军不断地得到因游击队袭击敌军而截获的战利品和地方工厂所生产的武器来补充那些愈来愈多的部队。这样，在四年中，越南军事力量已足以坚强地抵抗敌人，并且奠定此后胜利的基础。
    在这斗争中，越南总工会认为动员工人来支持战争是它的主要任务。觉悟的工人阶级以史无前例的辛劳为支援前线而工作。而且他们响应工会的号召，集体参军。军队中的工人占百分之十。此外，还组成“西贡突击队”、“河内公路自动保卫团”、“海防胡志明团”等。
    在敌人的企业中，工人进行着破坏工作，袭击和焚烧敌人的仓库、工厂和农场。
    在解放区重建的过程中，首先要提出的是工人搬厂的工作。我们的工人们经常用最原始的方法在居民和黑夜的掩护下，搬运数吨重的机器。完成这一任务后，接着的课题就是建立和保卫工厂。这些工厂必须分散在几个地方，而又要互相接应，而且隔一时期就得变换地方。工人们必须武装起来，经过军事训练，保卫工厂。由于工人们的努力和倡导，现在每一省都有一个兵工厂。在一切厂里，生产品都日益增加。一九四八年，生产品比前一年增长百分之六十，在第三年，生产品增加了二倍。
    工人们这种劳动热情不仅证明了他们了解自己在民族解放运动中的作用，同时也说明了他们在各种企业中的地位。工人阶级及其组织——越南总工会努力的协助建立这些工厂。工人们成为企业的真正主人。在很多工厂里，他们都选出自己优秀的代表作经理，大家共同监督生产及保卫工厂。
    在改善工人生活的问题上，越南总工会的任务是非常艰难的。一方面要动员工人增加生产，另一方面要尽一切可能来保证他们以较好的生活条件和劳动条件。为了满足军队和居民的需要，根据每个工厂工人大会的提议，工作日曾从八小时增加到九小时。目前在所有的工厂里逐渐采取改善工人供给的储备食粮，建筑舒适的住所。联合工会注意以最好的方式来组织工人的集体生活，这方面政府给予他们一切方便。职工会组织了公共食堂、会议厅、图书馆、体育馆等。
    在敌占区，工人情形完全不同。在那里工人生活非常困难，每天被迫作十二小时到十四小时的工，十岁到十六岁的童工和成年人做一样的工作，而所得的工资只有成年人工资的一半。敌占区的工人不能忍受这样的痛苦生活，他们便和越南共和国解放区的工人们更加密切地团结起来。越南总工会帮助了敌占区工人组织的工作，派遣自己的工作人员到那里去，同时用一切物资来支援他们。他们的秘密组织已经一天天发展起来了。
    越南工人阶级为了民族的解放曾做了很大的牺牲。越南总工会做为工人阶级的领导机关，尽了很大的努力。可是应该承认它还有很多缺点。
    １、工人阶级还未能享受到他所应享有的那些权利。
    ２、越南总工会没有能够保证自己有足够的干部与物资。
    ３、越南总工会的孤立地位阻碍着她和国际工人阶级建立正常的联系。
    ４、在组织方面，越南总工会还没有把大部分的脑力劳动者（记者、教育工作者等）团结在自己的队伍里。
    越南的工人阶级进行着英勇的斗争，但真正的工人运动还是薄弱的。在这方面，她需要外国，特别是在亚洲有丰富斗争经验的兄弟国家的支援。
    为了使我们将来的任务更明确起见，我们要提出各点来供大会讨论。
    （一）工会与民族解放运动之关系。在亚洲许多国家内，工人阶级是受了资本主义的、封建的和民族的三重压迫的，因此脱离了民族解放运动的工会运动是不可能的。为解放而斗争的工人阶级，应当帮助为反对封建制度而斗争的农民，应当加紧工农的联合，否则胜利也是不可能的。
    （二）我们对美国帝国主义者的“文化落后国家互助计划”的态度。亚澳工会的组织现在应当坚决反对这一计划。工会应当向工人指出这一计划是对工人利益和民族解放运动极端不利的。
    （三）工会组织问题。帝国主义者正使用武力和分化政策来破坏工会。他们利用同在一地区内不同国籍的工人的歧异来离间工人的团结。所以应当加强各种不同国籍工人间的团结，应当尽一切可能保证与世界工联的联络。即将成立的世界工联亚澳联络局就可担负这一任务。
    （四）压迫国家和被压迫国家工人的联络。帝国主义国家内的工人应当尽力援助一切被压迫的国家工人，但工会方面得设法使工人了解这种援助是有一定限度的。我们建议世界工联成立更广大的工作队，对艰苦斗争的国家给以精神和物质的援助。
    关于越南本国，我们提出下列请求：
    一、高绵（即柬埔寨）和谅山地方的工人，正和人民一起进行着反对法国殖民地的斗争。我们提议大会指示联络局研究这二地区的工人运动，并希望帮助他们建立自己的组织，支持他们的斗争。
    二、我们提议世界工联代表访问我们的解放区。越南工人阶级希望这是国际工人的大团结的标志，这个标志将给越南工人阶级带来无产阶级国际主义的新精神。
