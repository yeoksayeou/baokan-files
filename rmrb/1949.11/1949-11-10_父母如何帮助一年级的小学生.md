How Parents Can Help First Graders
　　Professor M. Bernstein
　　"Learning is work, and it will always be work, but it should be thought-provoking work, and the interest in learning should be aroused by the depth of these thoughts, rather than by irrelevant external decorations." The outstanding Russian educator K.D. Ushinsky often said this.
　　In school, children learn the basics of science and how to apply them in practice. Knowledge does not come by itself. To gain knowledge, children must work hard, take their studies seriously, and show genuine interest in their work.
　　"To learn to work well," Mikhail Ivanovich Kalinin said, "you must truly be interested in what you do; if you are not interested, you will never learn to do work."
　　The most important thing for parents is to assist the school in developing their children's interest in learning and a serious attitude toward their homework.
　　Long before a child starts school, parents should prepare him. This does not mean merely preparing the child's uniform, textbooks, and writing utensils. It is more important to prepare the child psychologically for school.
　　At the age of seven, a normally developing child has the desire to learn to read and write; because the adults around him read newspapers, read books, and receive letters. If you often read interesting fairy tales and stories printed in brightly colored books to such a child, he will quickly want to read them himself. Parents should encourage this desire.
　　The first day of school should be a happy and important event in every child's life. He should feel that he is entering a more attractive stage of his life, a world of knowledge richer than those storybooks he left behind. This day, as well as the first day of each school year, should be regarded as a special day, so that the child will feel that it is a commemorative day.
　　Parents should remember that when a child enters school, he is with a group of children, and their child must learn to get along with them. This is not easy for every child. Those children who have been spoiled at home also demand to occupy a special position when they are with a group of children. On the other hand, some children will be influenced by their domineering classmates and gradually lose their own personality.
　　Schools and their teachers help establish normal relationships between children, but parents can also assist. They must make their children feel that they are the same members of the class, with the same rights and responsibilities, and that they can get along well if they learn to respect the rights and demands of other children.
　　Children must choose their own friends. Their choices are based on common interests and emotional harmony. Friendships that begin in school should be encouraged and developed; children should be encouraged to visit each other's homes and spend their leisure time together.
　　A first-grade student often has great admiration for his first teacher. He not only obeys this new management very much, but also tries to imitate his teacher in everything. Often in the first period after entering school, children begin to use the teacher's words to oppose their parents. "The teacher said this," "Maria Antonovna said something different from this," one often hears first-grade students answering their parents' orders or explanations at home.
　　Ordinarily, parents understand the reason for this preference. They respect the prestige of the teacher, understand how much good it does, and try to encourage their children's deep respect for the teacher. But there are also some mothers who foolishly fear that their own prestige will be lowered, so they discuss the teacher in front of their children without considering it. This attitude either causes two-sided inconsistencies in the child's behavior, or unconsciously damages the parents' prestige. The contradiction between the prestige of the teacher and the prestige of the parents has a very bad influence on the education of the student.
　　Homework is particularly important in educating and training children. The teacher assigns homework to be done at home, but the responsibility of the parents here is very great. They must pay attention to whether the children's homework is done well.
　　Every child must have his own place to do his homework, and he should study at a fixed time every day. Some children do their homework as soon as they get home from school. Others don't, and wait until the last minute, so it gets very late. Both of these methods are harmful. Children who go to school in the morning should do their homework between 4 p.m. and 7 p.m., when they have already gone out to play. Those children who go to school in the afternoon should do it between 9 a.m. and 12 p.m. Having a fixed place and a set time to do homework gives children good study habits and teaches them to properly allocate their time without wasting it.
　　From the first grade onwards, the child should have his homework timetable. After forty to forty-five minutes of uninterrupted study, the child should rest for ten to fifteen minutes. During rest, it is best to engage in some light exercise.
　　One of the most important things in this system is to alternate difficult courses with easy courses. Parents should know which subject is the most difficult for their child and ask them to start their homework with these subjects first.
　　It is best to start with exercises that need to be written down, as they often require more time and more focused attention. But if these exercises require knowledge that the child lacks, he should study these materials first.
　　How is homework checked?
　　Younger children cannot find their mistakes even after they have checked it several times. So in the beginning, parents should check the child's homework together with him. However, gradually the child should be taught to check his own homework before showing it to his parents. This inspection should not be done in a sloppy manner, nor should it show any distrust of the child. On the contrary, it should be an expression of the parents' interest in their child's homework. The child will be willing to show his homework to his mother or father if he is completely confident in his parents, and he will be even more willing to do so.
　　When parents discover mistakes or careless places, they must point them out to the child very skillfully. One should not rush to help the child when difficulties arise, and answer for him. But it is also wrong to punish the child for the slightest mistake. One should study the reason why the child feels difficulty, and teach him how to overcome it. If this is done properly, he will find his own mistakes and correct them.
　　One should pay attention to whether the child is thinking about his homework, so that he understands the assigned exercises and learns to consider the main points without being confused by the confusing details.
　　Naturally, this kind of guidance for a student's homework requires some knowledge of child psychology. Parents should keep in contact with the school and seek the teacher's advice.
　　The joint efforts of teachers and parents have very good results in making first graders consciously devote themselves to their studies.

　　父母如何帮助一年级的小学生
    Ｍ·伯恩斯坦教授
    “学习就是个工作，而且它将一直是个工作，但是它应该是个灌注思想的工作，而且对于学习的兴趣应该是由这些思想的深度所引起，而不是由于无关系的外表的装饰。”优秀的俄国教育家Ｋ·Ｄ·由辛斯基常常这样说。
    在学校里儿童们学习初步的科学，而且学习如何去把它们应用于实际。知识不是自己来到的。要得到知识，儿童们必须努力做功课，严肃地对待他们的学习，在他们的工作中表现出真正的兴趣来。
    “要学着好好地工作，”米哈伊尔伊凡诺维赤·加里宁说：“你必须真正地对你所做的事发生兴趣；如果你没有兴趣，你绝不能学会做工作。”
    父母们的最重要的事，就是协助学校为他们的孩子发展对学习的兴趣，和对于功课的严肃的态度。
    在孩子开始进学校之前很久，父母就该使他有所准备了。这并不是说仅仅为孩子准备他的制服、课本和写字的用具。更重要的是使儿童在心理上已准备好进学校。
    在七岁的时候，一个发育正常的儿童，就有学习读书写字的欲望；因为在他周围的大人们都会看报纸，看书，而且收到信件。常常向这么大的儿童读那印在色彩鲜明的书本上的、有趣的童话和故事，他就很快地想自己去读了。做父母的应该鼓励这种欲望。
    入学的第一天，应该是每个儿童的生活上的一件快乐的大事。他应该感觉到他是正在走进他的生活上的一个更诱人的阶段，一个比他丢下的那些故事书里，有更丰富的知识的世界。这一天，以及每一学年的第一天，都应看做是个特别的日子，于是在孩子的心里，就会觉得这是个纪念日。
    父母们应该记着，孩子进了学校就是和一群儿童在一起，而且他们的孩子必须学着和他们相处。这对每个儿童来说，并不都是容易的事。那些在家里骄纵惯了的孩子，在和一群孩子一起的时候，也要求占有特殊的地位。另一方面，一些小孩子，也就会受他的霸道的同学的影响，而渐渐失去了他自己的个性。
    学校和它的教师们，都帮助在孩子们之间建立正常的关系，但是双亲也同样能进行协助。他们必须使他们的孩子觉得他们是一班里同样的成员，有同样的权利和责任，而且如果他们学会尊敬别的儿童的权利与要求，他们就能处得很好。
    儿童必须选择他自己的朋友。他的选择是基于共同的兴趣和感情上的融洽。在学校中开始的友谊，是应该受到鼓励与发扬的；应该使孩子们互相到人家家里去拜访，而且一同度过他们的闲暇时间。
    一个一年级的小学生，常常会对他的第一位教师非常钦佩。他不但很服从这新的管理，而且试着在每一件事情上模仿他的教师。常常在入学以后的第一个时期中，孩子们开始以教师的话，来反对他们的父母。“老师这么说的”，“马利亚安东诺瓦说的跟这个不一样”，常常听见一年级的小学生，在家里这样回答父母的命令或解释。
    照例，父母们是懂得这种喜好的原因的。他们尊重教师的威信，了解它有多少好处，而且试着鼓励他们的孩子们对于教师的深深的崇敬。但是还有一些母亲，愚蠢地害怕降低了她们自己的威信，就毫不考虑地在孩子面前议论教师。这种态度不是引起孩子的行为上的两方面不符合，就是不知不觉地损害了父母的威信。教师与父母的威信之间的矛盾，在对于学童的教养上，有很坏的影响。
    家庭作业，在教育与训练儿童上，是特别重要的。教师指定了回家去做的功课，但是父母在这里的责任是很大的。他们必须注意孩子们的家庭作业是否做好了。
    每个孩子必须有自己的地方，来做功课，而且他应该在每天的一定的时间来用功。有些孩子从学校回到家来，立刻就做功课。还有一些就不做，一直等到最后的一分钟，于是就弄得很晚了。这两种方法都是有害的。早晨到学校去的孩子，应该在下午四点到七点的时候做功课，那时他们已经出去玩过了。那些在下午上学的孩子，就该在早上九点到十二点之间来做。有一个固定的地方和规定的时间，来做功课，就使得儿童有好的学习习惯，并教育他适当地支配他的时间，不致浪费了它。
    从第一年级起，孩子就该有他的功课的时间表。在四十至四十五分钟的不间断的学习之后，孩子应该休息十分钟到十五分钟。在休息的时候，最好是进行一些轻度的运动。
    这种制度中的一个最要紧的事，是把困难的课程，和容易的课程相间起来。父母应该知道哪一门功课，对他们的孩子是最难的，就叫他们先从这些门的家庭作业来开始。
    最好是先从要写下来的习题开始，因为它们常常是需要更多的时间和更集中的注意力。但是如果这些习题，需要那孩子所缺少的知识，他就该先学习这些材料。
    家庭作业怎样检查呢？
    年纪小一些的孩子，甚至在他们检查了好几遍之后，还是找不出他们的错误来。所以在开始的时候，父母应该和他一起来检查孩子的家庭作业。但是，渐渐地就应该教给孩子，在他把做好的功课拿给父母看之前，自己先检查好。这种检查，不应采用马虎的态度，也不应表现出对孩子的任何不信任。相反地，它应当是父母对于他们的孩子的功课的兴趣的表现。孩子自己会愿意把他做的功课，拿给他的母亲或父亲看，如果他完全相信他的父母，他就更会愿意这样做。
    当父母发现了错误，或是不小心的地方时，他必须很技巧地向孩子指出来。不应该在刚一发生困难的时候，就马上去帮助孩子的忙，替他解答。但是为了最微小的错误，就处罚孩子也是不对的。应当研究孩子感觉困难的原因，教给他如何去克服它。如果这一点做的很洽当，他就会自己发现他的错误，而改正了它。
    应该注意孩子是否思考他的功课，使他了解指定的习题，学会考虑主要之点，而不致为纷乱的枝节所迷惑。
    自然，这种对于一个学童的功课的指导，需要一些儿童心理学上的知识。父母应该经常与学校接触，征求教师的意见。
    教师与家长联合起来的努力，在使一年级的小学生，有意识地致力于他的学习上，得到非常好的效果。
