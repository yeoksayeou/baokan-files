　　Organizing Sideline Production Should Prioritize Securing Sales Channels
　　Heilongjiang Leaders Gain Experience in Sideline Production
　　[Reported by this newspaper] Heilongjiang Province has gained the following important experience in organizing sideline production: Cooperatives should not only engage in various sideline industries according to the different conditions of each region, but also investigate in advance which sideline products sell well, so as to avoid being unable to sell them and wasting labor and capital. The provincial cooperative headquarters first signed a contract with the caustic soda factory to promote the sale of local alkali and caustic soda, and then notified various places to sweep the soil and boil alkali; the Changfa District United Cooperative of Suihua County signed a contract with the county United Cooperative to promote the sale of five thousand reed mats. All of these involved investigating and securing sales channels in advance, which played a significant role in motivating farmers to actively participate in sideline production.
　　[Another report] Linjiang Village in the Sixth District of Tailai County, Heilongjiang Province, has very good conditions for carrying out sideline production, especially fishing, cutting willow branches, and weaving baskets. However, in the past, due to a lack of leadership, the results were not great. On the 4th of this month, the village people's representative meeting discussed the issue of engaging in sideline production this winter and reviewed several shortcomings that existed in past sideline production efforts: First, wasted manpower. Last year, for fishing, one net originally required only fifty people, but more than seventy people participated. Second, the issue of sales channels. The leadership only called for weaving fish baskets, without paying attention to finding sales channels. Farmer Wu Junshan wove more than twenty fish baskets, but had nowhere to sell them. At that time, he said: "I will never weave again!" Third, it was not comprehensively organized. Of the village's one hundred and twenty-two laborers, only about seventy laborers fished, and only about thirty laborers wove baskets and mats, etc., and they did not do it regularly.
　　After reviewing the shortcomings, the meeting proposed that in the future, sideline production should be carried out based on the specific conditions of the village, with fishing as the main focus. Fifty people should be used for each net, two households with silk gill nets should use six people, and seven people should fish with hooks. In addition, ten people should hunt, thirty-one people should weave fish baskets and mats, etc., and the remaining people should be universally organized to collect firewood. Twelve women who know how to weave mats and twenty-one who know how to spin yarn should carry out production according to their individual abilities. Based on past lessons, attention has been paid to the sales channels of products. There is no problem with selling fish and willow branches, as they can be sold in Jiangqiao Street. A contract has been signed with the Jiangqiao Fisheries Cooperative for weaving baskets, and the district United Cooperative will promote the sale of mats. As a result, the farmers' concerns about not being able to sell their products have been dispelled, and they have organized themselves to engage in sideline production.

　　组织副业生产应先找好销路
　　黑龙江领导副业生产获经验
    【本报讯】黑龙江省在组织副业生产中，获得以下重要经验：合作社不但应根据各地区不同情况搞各种副业，还要事先调查好那些副业销路好，免得卖不出去，浪费了人工本钱。该省合作总社先和火碱厂订立推销土碱火碱合同，再通知各地扫土熬碱；绥化县长发区联社和县联社订立推销五千领苇席的合同，都是事先调查找好销路，对推动农民积极参加副业生产上，起了很大作用。
    【又讯】黑龙江省泰来县六区临江村，具备着进行副业生产的很好的条件，尤其打鱼，割条子，编筐更便利。可是过去因为缺乏领导，成绩不大。本月四号，村人民代表会，讨论了今冬搞副业问题，检讨出过去搞副业存在的几个缺点：第一、旷费人力。去年打鱼，一趟网本来五十人就够用，却有七十多人参加。第二、销路问题。领导上光号召编鱼筐，没注意找销路，农民吴俊山编了二十多个鱼筐，没处卖。当时他说：“我再也不编了！”第三、没有全面组织起来。全村一百二十二个劳力，除了七十来个劳力打鱼，只有三十来个劳力编筐、席等，还不经常干。
    检讨出缺点后，会上提出今后搞副业，应根据本村具体情况，以打鱼为主，全村一趟网用五十人，有两户有丝挂子网用六人，下钓的七个人。另外，打猎的十个人，编鱼筐和席子等的三十一个人，剩下的普遍组织起来打柴火。妇女有十二个会编席子的，有二十一个会纺线，按照每个人能力进行生产。根据过去的教训，已注意了产品的销路，打鱼、割条子不成问题，拉到江桥街就能卖。编筐已和江桥渔业合作社订了合同，编席子由区联社给推销。这样一来，打消了农民怕产品卖不出的顾虑，纷纷组织起来投入副业生产。
