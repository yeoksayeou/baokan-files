　　Beijing Women's Congress Successfully Concludes
　　Beijing Municipal Democratic Women's Federation Formally Established
[Beijing News] The first Beijing Municipal Women's Congress successfully concluded yesterday (the 29th). The congress formally established the Beijing Municipal Democratic Women's Federation, electing 57 people, including Zhang Xiaomei and Yang Yunyu, as members of the first Executive Committee. It also elected Zhang Xiaomei, Yang Zaoxin, Liu Qingyang, Lei Jieqiong, Li Zhuobao, Pu Jiexu, Chou Zigang and others as representatives from Beijing to the Asian Women's Representative Conference (Chou Zigang is an alternate representative). Yesterday afternoon, Deng Yingchao, Vice-Chairman of the National Democratic Women's Federation, attended the meeting and delivered a speech (full text to be published separately). Her speech was met with prolonged applause from the audience. Xiao Ming, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, extended greetings to the congress on behalf of the federation. The congress unanimously passed a telegram of salute to Chairman Mao and the Chairman of the National Democratic Women's Federation, and also sent a telegram protesting the reactionary Nehru government of India's atrocities in slaughtering peasant (including women) leaders. Zhang Xiaomei summarized the achievements and shortcomings of the four-day congress, and put forward four hopes: (1) Unite around the Women's Federation, learn from each other, take the resolutions back, and convey them in detail to the masses. (2) Focus on experimenting with the form of representative conferences. (3) Bring into play the spirit of hard work, patience, and fearlessness of difficulties, and do a good job in women's work. (4) Strengthen contact with the Municipal Women's Federation. Finally, Yang Baojun delivered the closing speech.
　　To express support for the congress and respect for the representatives, yesterday, 19 units, including the Los Angeles Nursery, the Beihai Experimental Nursery, the City Student Union YWCA Nursery, the Children's Welfare Demonstration Station Nursery, the Student Union of Normal University, the National First Midwifery School, the Beijing Branch of the Chinese Women's Friendship Association, and the Women's Handicraft Factory, presented flags, flowers, and gifts to the congress.
