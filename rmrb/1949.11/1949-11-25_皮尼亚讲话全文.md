Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 23rd—The following is the full text of the speech by Mr. Piña, Vice-Chairman of the World Federation of Trade Unions and General Secretary of the Cuban Confederation of Workers, at the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference on the 21st:

	Comrades: On behalf of the Cuban working class and the Cuban people, I extend brotherly greetings to the delegates of the conference and, through them, to the workers and people of Asia and Australia!

	Each delegate has already spoken about the great significance of this conference in various aspects for the people of the countries they represent, and that is very true. I believe that the issues discussed at this conference and its conclusions are related to the people of all colonies and semi-colonies around the world and are helpful to their immediate interests.

	Geographically speaking, our country is tens of thousands of miles away from you, but our country and the countries you represent are similar in many ways. In Cuba, imperialists prevent Cuba's own economic development, support colonial backward forces; they restrict the people's democracy and support anti-democratic governments. As imperialism enters its inevitable crisis, their economic oppression of us and their exploitation of our working class make our working class even poorer. Imperialist monopoly capital occupies most of the land in Cuba and prevents our country from freely trading with other countries in the world. As a result, they swallowed up our products. Here I am not prepared to go into detail about the crisis our country is encountering. Because, unfortunately, our country is far away from you, far away from the new China and the Soviet Union, so I do not need to report on the situation in our country. But we must know that the significance of this conference goes far beyond geographical boundaries. And I want to assure the conference that I will definitely take the resolutions of the conference back to Cuba, to other places, and tell our people.

	The World Federation of Trade Unions is strengthening the struggle of the working class, practically organizing the struggle against unemployment, against racial discrimination, and fighting for trade union rights and the protection of workers' labor and social security. We are against hunger and against war. We are united, and our unity will surely defeat those economic crises imposed on the people of colonies and dependencies, and the war provocation behavior of world imperialism attempting to attack the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries.

	We must emphasize one fact: the World Federation of Trade Unions and this conference it is holding in Beijing not only illustrate but also prove that the existence of our international trade union organization is not to maintain imperialist exploitation of the colonies, but to overthrow this system. We trade unions of various colonies and dependencies that participate in the World Federation of Trade Unions, in addition to striving for the daily economic rights of the working class, must also bravely lead and mobilize all the people to fight for democratic independence.

	For other colonial countries, we who participate in the World Federation of Trade Unions must do our best to support the struggles of these colonial brothers. Today, the French trade unions are doing this, the progressive trade unions in the Netherlands are also doing this, and the World Federation of Trade Unions is doing this even more. This kind of help is enthusiastically supported and welcomed by the working classes of many countries.

	This conference held in Beijing is in itself a blow to imperialism and a blow to the scabs within the trade unions. The success of our conference will give them an even heavier blow.

	Now, hundreds of thousands of workers in our colonial countries are about to implement the resolutions of this conference, and the World Federation of Trade Unions' assistance to the colonial workers will be further strengthened.

	As a member of the Executive Committee of the World Federation of Trade Unions, I express my great satisfaction with the success of this conference. As the secretary of the Cuban Confederation of Workers, I would like to thank you again for giving me the opportunity to learn about the struggles of the workers in many Asian and Australian countries.

	We also want to thank the Chinese People's Government and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions for their fraternal hospitality. Long live the great Chinese workers and their contribution to the liberation of the world!

　　皮尼亚讲话全文
    【新华社北京二十三日电】世界工联副主席、古巴总工会总书记皮尼亚二十一日在亚澳工会会议上讲话全文如下：
    同志们：我代表古巴工人阶级和古巴人民向大会的代表们并通过代表们向亚洲澳洲的工人和人民致兄弟的敬礼！
    每位代表都已经讲到了这次大会在各方面对他们所代表的国家的人民有莫大的意义，这是很对的。我认为，这次会议所讨论的问题及其结论是关系到全世界各殖民地和半殖民地的人民的，而且对他们的切身利益是有帮助的。
    在地理上讲起来，我们的国家离开你们有几万英里，可是我们国家和你们所代表的这些国家在很多方面是相类似的。在古巴，帝国主义者阻止着古巴自己的经济发展，支持着殖民地落后的力量；他们限制人民的民主，而支持反民主的政府。由于帝国主义进入了他们不可避免的危机，所以他们对于我们的经济上的压迫，对于我们工人阶级的剥削，使我们工人阶级更加贫穷了。帝国主义的独占资本强占了古巴大部分的土地，而且使得我们国家不能自由地跟世界其他国家来贸易。由于这个结果，他们把我们的物产都吞并了。在这里我不预备很详细的来讲我们国家是遭遇到怎么样的危机。因为很不幸的我们的国家离开你们很远，离开新中国和苏联很远，所以我并没有必要来报告我们国家里的情况。可是我们必须知道这次大会的意义是远超过地理范围的。而且我要向大会保证：我一定把大会的决议带回去，带到古巴，带到其他地方去，告诉我们的人民。
    世界工联正在为加强工人阶级的斗争，很实际地组织起反对失业，反对种族歧视的斗争，为争取工会的权利和保护工人劳动，保护工人社会安全而斗争。我们是反对饥饿、反对战争的，我们团结在一起，而且我们的团结是一定会把加在殖民地和附属国人民肩上的那些经济危机，和世界帝国主义企图进攻苏联和人民民主国家的这种战争挑拨的行为打败。
    我们必须强调一件事实，就是世界工联以及它这次在北京所召开的这个会议，不但说明而且证明了我们国际工会组织的存在不是为维持帝国主义对殖民地的剥削，而相反要推翻这种制度。我们参加世界工联的各殖民地和附属国的工会除了要争取工人阶级的日常经济的权利之外，而且要英勇地领导和动员所有的人民，为民主独立而斗争。
    对于其他殖民国家，我们参加世界工联的，要尽力支持这些殖民地兄弟们的斗争。在今天法国的工会就是这样做了，荷兰进步的工会也这样做了，世界工联更是这样做了。这种帮助受到好多国家工人阶级的热烈拥护和欢迎。
    这一次在北京召开的这个会议，它的本身就是对帝国主义的一个打击，对于工会中间的工贼也是一个打击，我们召开这个会议的成就会给他们以更重的打击。
    现在我们殖民地国家里的成千成万的工人，要开始执行这个会议的决议，世界工联在殖民地工人的帮助是会更加加强的。
    我以世界工联执行局委员的身份表示，我对于这一个会议的成功十分满意。我作为古巴总工会的书记要再向大家致谢，因为你们给了我机会来学习很多亚洲澳洲国家的工人的斗争经验。
    我们也要感谢中国的人民政府和中华全国总工会对我们的兄弟的招待，伟大的中国工人以及他们给予世界上解放的贡献万岁！
