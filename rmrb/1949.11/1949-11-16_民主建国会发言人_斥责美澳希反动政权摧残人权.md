  　Condemns US, Australian, and Greek Reactionary Regimes for Trampling on Human Rights
    [This newspaper reports] The spokesperson of the Democratic National Construction Association issued an article yesterday (the 15th) entitled "Condemning the atrocities of various reactionary regimes, headed by the United States, in trampling on human rights." The original text is as follows:
    In the past month, a series of atrocities trampling on human rights have occurred within the circle of old democracy. The US Federal Court in New York, using the vicious method of "fabricating charges," sentenced the General Secretary of the US Communist Party, Dennis, and ten other leaders to three to five years in prison and a fine of ten thousand US dollars each. Even the lawyers who defended them were sentenced to imprisonment. The Australian Supreme Court in Melbourne sentenced the General Secretary of the Australian Communist Party, Sharkey, to three years in prison. The Greek Military Tribunal in Athens sentenced the Greek revolutionary woman leader Katrin and five other revolutionary leaders to death. Argentine police disrupted a people's rally celebrating the October Revolution and arrested 705 leaders and people of the Argentine Communist Party. This inhumane and barbaric behavior declared the complete bankruptcy of the old democracy and clearly indicated that the reactionary regimes of these countries are approaching their final night.
    A regime ruled by a minority over the majority, when the majority has awakened, has no choice but to use the terror of death and imprisonment to suppress them. A ruling class that seeks the interests of a minority is naturally selfish and cruel; benevolence is just a pretty mask. Only the Communist Party, which has class love for the broad proletariat, can have genuine benevolence towards the people of the whole country and even all mankind. The reason why the Soviet Union has become the leading force for democracy and peace in the world should be understood primarily from its social system, but also from this great human love.
    Class hatred is entirely a product of capitalism, and the instigators of hatred are precisely the bourgeoisie themselves. China is now implementing New Democracy and has established a people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class. China's national bourgeoisie has joined this new regime and has received unprecedented encouragement and freedom. The Chinese Communist Party treats all democratic parties and the people of the whole country with brotherly friendship, and only a very small number of incorrigible enemies of the people are subject to sanctions. The broad masses of workers, organized and led by the CCP, also get along with capitalists like brothers, working together to develop production. With the attitude of "clear accounts between brothers," they strive for the due interests of their own class. Although there are fundamental conflicts of interest between labor and capital, under the leadership of the working class, it is possible to reasonably adjust these conflicts. This guarantees that the ideal of peacefully entering socialism in the future can be realized. The situation is completely different under the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie; selfishness and cruelty will only make the contradictions more and more serious, and bloody revolution becomes inevitable.
    This extremely clear contrast proves that the old democracy has aged and is approaching death, and the New Democracy is the truly modern political system that can guarantee the freedom and interests of the majority. In addition to severely condemning these atrocities that trample on human rights, we are willing to use our own experience to explain some of the realities of New Democracy.

### 民主建国会发言人　斥责美澳希反动政权摧残人权

　　民主建国会发言人
  　斥责美澳希反动政权摧残人权
    【本报讯】民主建国会发言人于昨（十五）日发表“斥责以美国为首的各国反动政权摧残人权的暴行”一文，原文如下：
    在最近的一个月当中，在旧民主主义的圈子里，发生了一连串的摧残人权的暴行。美国纽约联邦法院以“罗织成狱”的毒辣手段，判处美共总书记但尼斯等十一位领袖以三年至五年的徒刑和每人一万美元的罚金，连替他们辩护的律师也被判处徒刑。澳洲墨尔本最高法院判处澳共总书记夏基徒刑三年。希腊雅典军事法庭对希腊革命妇女领袖卡特林和其他五位革命领袖判处死刑。阿根庭警察捣乱了人民庆祝十月革命的大会，逮捕了七百另五名的阿共领袖和人民。这种不顾人道，灭绝人性的野蛮行为，宣告了旧民主主义的完全破产，明示了这些国家的反动政权，已经临到死亡的前夜。
    一个以少数人统治多数人的政权，等到多数人已经觉悟的时候，它就只好用死亡和牢狱的恐怖来镇压了。一个为少数人谋利益的统治阶级，自私和残忍是当然的，博爱只不过是一副好看的面具而已。只有能对广大的无产阶级具有阶级爱的共产党，才可能有进一步对全国人民以至全世界人类的真正的博爱。苏联之所以成为全世界民主和平的领导力量，基本的当然应该从她的社会制度去理解，同时也应该从这种伟大的人类爱去理解。
    阶级的恶憎完全是资本主义的产物，恶憎的挑拨者正是资产阶级自已。中国现在实行了新民主主义，建立了以工人阶级为领导的人民民主专政的政权，中国的民族资产阶级参加了这个新政权，得到了空前无比的鼓励和自由。中国共产党用兄弟般的友爱，对待一切民主党派和全国人民，受到制裁的只限于极少数的怙恶不悛的人民死敌。经过中共的组织和领导的广大工人，也和资本家兄弟般的相处，共同为发展生产而努力。他们用“亲兄弟明算帐”的心情，争取自己阶级的应有利益。尽管劳资两方存在着基本的利害矛盾，然而，在工人阶级领导之下的政权，对于这种矛盾，是可能很合理的加以调节的。这就保证了将来和平进入社会主义的理想的必然可以实现。在资产阶级专政之下情形就完全两样，自私和残忍只会使矛盾一天一天的严重化，流血的革命变成了无可避免。
    这种极其鲜明的对照，证明了旧民主主义已经由衰老而接近死亡，新民主主义才是现时代的真正能保证大多数人的自由和利益和政治制度。我们除了严厉的斥责这些摧残人权的暴行之外，愿意用自己亲身体会得到的经验，说明一点新民主义的实情。
