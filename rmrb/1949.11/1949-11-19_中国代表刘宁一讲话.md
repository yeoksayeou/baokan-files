Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 18th: The full text of Liu Ningyi's speech at the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference is as follows:

　　Since 1945, the World Federation of Trade Unions has been fighting against imperialists and disruptors of the world trade union movement to defend world peace and democracy, defend the interests of the working class, and help workers in oppressed countries. As Comrade Saillant mentioned in his report, it has made great efforts to help workers in Asian and Australian countries. The Chinese working class has always actively supported the World Federation of Trade Unions in the past, and will do so even more in the future.

　　Today's convening of the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference is a manifestation of the victory of our common struggle and a major step towards our further unity.

　　Under the personal leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese working class and people, the Chinese working class, for its own liberation and for the common cause of the world workers' movement, first united the workers and the people of the whole country, formed a strong national united front, and received the sincere help and support from the Soviet workers and workers’ brothers from all over the world, and waged a heroic struggle against the American imperialists and their running dog Chiang Kai-shek, causing the war provocateurs headed by American imperialism to suffer a disastrous defeat in the East. 475 million people are about to achieve complete liberation, truly winning China's independence, freedom, democracy, and peace. The working class has become the master of society and the leading class of the country.

　　The workers in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, whom the World Federation of Trade Unions is most concerned about, will no longer be subjected to such cruel oppression and exploitation. With the strength accumulated over many years, they cooperated with the People's Liberation Army, showing majestic power, liberating Tianjin, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and other large cities. Soon, they will liberate Taiwan and Tibet. The light of victory shines on the land of freedom and unity.

　　In China, the people have been liberated, and the Chinese working class and laboring people have united into a strong force, leading the people of the whole country to eliminate the remnants of the enemy and strive to build a free, happy, and industrialized China!

　　For many years, we have received the heartfelt concern and assistance from Soviet workers and workers all over the world. Today, we see that brothers and sisters from all countries have come to Beijing. This is a great joy for Chinese workers, a great joy for Asian and Australian workers, and a great joy for workers all over the world. The reactionaries once dreamed that the World Federation of Democratic Trade Unions would be weakened by the withdrawal of trade union scabs. Today, we loudly tell them that the strength of the World Federation of Trade Unions is growing stronger and developing day by day.

　　China has learned from its own experience the greatness of this united strength and the confidence that the people will surely win the cause of defending peace! We can completely tear apart the paper tiger of imperialism.

　　The victorious Chinese working class must show pride to the enemy, humbly learn from the Soviet workers, unite more closely with our progressive trade unions in Asia and Australia, and strengthen ties with the World Federation of Trade Unions. The power of people's unity is invincible, and the victory of peace-loving people all over the world will come one after another. Indeed, we cannot deny that the imperialists are still struggling desperately, oppressing our unliberated workers in Asia and Australia, but the workers and people of all countries are waging unyielding struggles against imperialism and its running dogs. We Chinese workers must provide all possible assistance to our brothers who were oppressed as we were in the past, especially the workers’ brothers in Asian and Australian countries. This is a responsibility we have deeply recognized from our own struggle experience.

　　Workers’ brothers in Asia and Australia, unite and fight for national liberation and workers’ interests!

　　Workers’ brothers all over the world, unite and fight for lasting peace for mankind!

　　Down with imperialism!

　　Long live peace and democracy!

　　Long live the success of the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference!

　　Long live the World Federation of Trade Unions!

　　Long live Chairman Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese working class and people!

　　Long live Marshal Stalin, the teacher of the world working class and people!

　　中国代表刘宁一讲话
    【新华社北京十八日电】刘宁一在亚澳工会会议上的讲话全文如下：
    世界工会联合会自一九四五年以来，为了保卫世界的和平民主，捍卫工人阶级的利益，帮助被压迫国家的工人，一直与帝国主义者作斗争，与世界工运统一的破坏者作斗争。为了帮助亚洲澳洲各国工人，正如赛扬同志报告中所说，曾做过很大的努力。我们中国工人阶级，在过去一向是积极支持世界工联的，今后更加要这样做。
    今天亚澳工会会议的召开，正是我们共同斗争胜利的表现，也是我们进一步团结的重大步骤。
    中国工人阶级为了自己的解放，为了世界工人运动的共同事业，在中国工人阶级和人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席亲自领导下，首先团结了全国的工人和全国人民，结成了一个强有力的民族统一阵线，并获得了苏联工人和世界各国工人兄弟真诚的帮助和声援，和美帝国主义者及其走狗蒋介石做了英勇的斗争，使以美帝国主义为首的战争挑拨者在东方遭到了惨败，四万万七千五百万的人民就要获得全部解放，真正争得了中国的独立自由民主和平，工人阶级已经成了社会的主人，国家的领导阶级。
    世界工联所最关切的国民党统治区的工人们，再也不受那种残酷的压迫和剥削了。他们以多年蓄积下来的力量，配合了人民解放军，表现了雄伟的力量，解放了天津、北京、上海、广州和其他大城市，不久就会解放台湾和西藏，胜利的光芒照耀着自由统一的大地。
    在中国，人民已经获得了解放，中国工人阶级和劳动人民已团结得成一个强大队伍，领导着全国人民肃清残敌，为建设一个自由幸福的工业化的中国而努力！
    我们多少年来受到苏联工人和全世界工人衷心的关怀协助，我们今天看到了各国的兄弟娣妹们都来了北京，这是中国工人的大喜事，这是亚洲澳洲工人的大喜事，这是世界工人的大喜事。反动者也曾梦想世界民主工会曾由于工贼退出而削弱，今天我们大声告诉他们，世界工联的力量日益强大发展。
    中国是从切身经验中体会了这团结力量的伟大和人民保卫和平事业必胜的信心！帝国主义纸老虎我们可以彻底撕碎它。
    胜利了的中国工人阶级对敌人要表示骄傲，对苏联工人要虚心学习，和我们亚洲澳洲的进步工会更加团结，与世界工联的联系要更加密切。人民团结的力量是无敌的，全世界爱好和平人民的胜利是会一个连一个的。的确，我们不能否认，帝国主义者还在拼死地挣扎，压迫我们亚洲澳洲未解放的工人，但是各国工人和人民正在为反对帝国主义及其走狗，做着不屈不挠的斗争。我们中国工人对象我们过去一样受压迫的兄弟们，特别是亚洲澳洲各国的工人兄弟们，要尽一切可能予以援助，这是我们从自身的斗争经验所深深认识的责任。
    亚洲澳洲的工人兄弟们团结起来，为民族解放和工人利益而斗争！
    世界各国工人兄弟们团结起来，为人类的持久和平而斗争！
    打倒帝国主义！
    和平民主万岁！
    亚洲澳洲工会会议成功万岁！
    世界工联万岁！
    中国工人阶级和人民的领袖毛泽东主席万岁！
    世界工人阶级和人民的导师斯大林大元帅万岁！
