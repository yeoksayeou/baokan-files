    Zhangjiakou Plague-Affected Village Ji Family Houses
    Plague Stopped Spreading
    One Child Infected with Plague Cured After Treatment
    Three Suspected Cases Confirmed Not to be Plague
    [This newspaper's Zhangjiakou Dispatch, 14th] The plague in Ji Family Houses, a village in the Zhangjiakou rural area, has stopped spreading. Of the four suspected plague cases previously discovered, three have been confirmed not to have plague. Wen Zhao, who lived in the same courtyard as the plague-affected household, and the head of the local police station stationed in the plague village, have been completely proven to have severe colds after examination and treatment by the Soviet anti-epidemic team. One soldier from a certain unit who was ill has pleurisy. The six-year-old son of the deceased Guo Jingde and his wife, who died from pneumonic plague, was indeed infected with the plague. Due to early detection, he was rescued with a mixed therapy of Soviet-produced serum, methylene blue, streptomycin, and sulfonamide and other special medicines. The boy has now recovered.
