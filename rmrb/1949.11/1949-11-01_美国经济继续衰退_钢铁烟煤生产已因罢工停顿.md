Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 31st (TASS from New York, October 29th): Despite official efforts to support the economy through massive war appropriations, recent statistics indicate that the U.S. economic situation continues to decline.

　　Due to strikes, steel and anthracite production has virtually come to a standstill. However, strikes alone cannot account for the recent renewed downward trend in the U.S. economy. Various important sectors of the economy unaffected by strikes, especially the capital goods (i.e., machinery, equipment, and factory buildings that can be used as fixed capital) manufacturing industry, have begun to show clearer signs of crisis.

　　The New York Times reported that the weekly business activity index for the week ending October 15th was 121.8, while the weekly business activity index for the same period last year was 148.3. This represents a decrease of more than 17 percent. Railway freight figures, which are generally recognized as a fairly accurate indicator of general economic activity, show a particularly sharp decline. The "American Railway Association" estimates that the freight volume for the week ending October 22nd was slightly more than 589,000 carloads, a decrease of 36.5 percent compared to the same week last year. Although the coal miners' strike is partly responsible for this sharp decline, it also indicates a deterioration in the general economic situation.

　　Even more serious is the sharp decline in factory construction, which has become increasingly apparent. On October 27th, the Wall Street Journal reported that government statistics estimate that the total value of factory construction in September of this year was 40 percent lower than in September of last year. The Wall Street Journal's own survey indicates that this downward trend is continuing. The Wall Street Journal stated that contractors in Boston estimate that factory construction in Boston is currently 50 percent lower than last year. It is estimated that factory construction in Cleveland is currently 40 percent lower than in October of last year, and commercial building construction has decreased by about 20 percent. It is also estimated that factory and commercial building construction in the first nine months of this year decreased by almost 50 percent compared to the same period last year. Although the decline in factory construction was anticipated, the recession in recent weeks has been far more rapid than originally expected.

　　The decline in production, the spread of unemployment, and the large-scale strikes involving more than one million workers—all these factors have further shrunk the domestic market. This situation is occurring precisely when export trade is also gradually declining.

　　According to the Federal Reserve Board, department store sales for the week ending October 22nd decreased by 14 percent compared to the same period last year. In the previous week, department store sales showed a decrease of 13 percent. The reduction in retail sales is particularly severe in the Pittsburgh and Cleveland areas, which are most affected by the steel and coal mine strikes. Last week, department store sales in these areas decreased by 24 percent compared to the same period last year.

　　Some businessmen have recognized the unfavorable prospects for the U.S. economy. Leason, Vice President of the influential "Banking Trust Company," stated in a speech to the Cleveland Bankers Club on October 24th: "The next twelve months will be characterized by a decline in production indices, an increase in unemployment, and further price weakness. Several non-durable goods industries underwent considerable 'adjustment' at the beginning of this year, but many important heavy industries still appear to require 'correction.' For business, a recession in heavy industry is usually more serious than a recession in industries such as textiles."

### 美国经济继续衰退　钢铁烟煤生产已因罢工停顿

　　美国经济继续衰退
  　钢铁烟煤生产已因罢工停顿
    【新华社北京三十一日电】塔斯社纽约二十九日讯：尽管官方用庞大的战争拨款来努力支持经济，而最近所得的统计指明：美国经济情势仍在继续衰退中。
    由于罢工的关系，钢铁及烟煤的生产实际上已告停顿。但仅仅罢工并不能作为美国经济最近恢复下降趋势的理由。未遭受罢工影响的经济中各种重要部分，尤其是资本货物（即机器装备及厂房等可用作固定资本的货物）制造工业，已开始更为明确地表示出危机的明证。
    纽约时报报道：迄十月十五日为止一周的每周商业活动指数为一二一点八，而去年同期间的每周商业活动指数则为一四八点三。这表示百分之十七以上的下降。公认为相当确切地表示一般经济活动的铁路货运数字，尤其表现急剧的下降。“美国铁路协会”估计：迄十月二十二日为止一周中的货运量为五十八万九千车皮稍强，与去年同一周比较，下降了百分之三十六点五。虽然煤矿罢工为这种急剧下降的部分原因，但这也表示出一般经济情势的恶化。
    甚至更为严重的，是工厂建筑的急剧下降，这已益趋明显了。十月二十七日，华尔街日报报道：政府的统计数字估计，本年九月间，工厂建筑的总值较去年九月间低百分之四十。华尔街日报自己的调查表示：这种下降趋势在继续发展中。华尔街日报称：波士顿城的承造商们估计，目前，波士顿的工厂建筑较去年低百分之五十。据估计：目前，克利夫兰的工厂建筑较去年十月低百分之四十，而商业店房的建筑已约降低百分之二十。又据估计，本年头九个月的工厂及商业店房的建筑，较去年同一期间差不多降低了百分之五十。虽然工厂建筑的下降早已在预料之中，但最近数周的衰退，实较原来的预料远为急剧。
    生产的下降、失业的蔓延、牵连一百余万工人的大罢工——这一切都进一步缩减了国内市场。而这种事态的发生，恰当输出业亦在逐步下降的时候。
    据联邦准备局估计：迄十月二十二日为止的一周中，百货公司的售货量较去年同一期间降低了百分之十四。在前一周中，百货公司的售货量显示百分之十三的下降。零售商店售货量的减缩，在匹茨堡及克利夫兰地区尤其严重。这些地方受钢铁及煤矿罢工的影响最大。上周中，这些地方百货公司的售货量较去年同一期间降低了百分之二十四。
    若干商人已觉察到美国经济的不利远景。很大势力的“银行业信托公司”副总裁雷埃森于十月二十四日在克利夫兰银行家俱乐部发表演说称：“未来十二个月的特点，将是生产指数的下降、失业的增加、以及进一步的物价疲软。若干非耐久物品工业，在本年初经过了颇大的‘调整’，但是，许多重要的重工业，似仍须予以‘矫正’。对商业而言，重工业的衰退通常较经济中纺织品一类物品方面的衰退更为严重”。
