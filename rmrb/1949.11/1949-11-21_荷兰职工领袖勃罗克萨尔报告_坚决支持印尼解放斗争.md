Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 20th—Broeksz, Vice-Chairman of the World Federation of Trade Unions and Dutch labor leader, delivered a speech at the Asian-Australasian Trade Union Conference today, supporting the report made by Indonesian trade union representative Mazono on the situation of Indonesian trade unions and their struggle for national independence and freedom. The main points of Broeksz's speech are as follows:

    The Indonesian representative pointed out in his report that the Indonesian people's democracy, freedom, and independence have been completely deprived. The entire Indonesian working people are subjected to the brutal oppression of American imperialism and Dutch imperialism. The Dutch working class cannot and should not adopt a passive attitude towards this situation, and must have a firm stand.

    There are currently two different attitudes towards the situation in Indonesia. One is to support the colonial policy directed by the US State Department and implemented by the Polish government; the other is to unconditionally support the Indonesian national liberation movement. In the report of World Federation of Trade Unions General Secretary Saillant, it has already been said that the path taken by the unions organized by those reformists is precisely the path of supporting American imperialism's oppression of the Indonesian people. Needless to say, these reformists are still trying to hide their rebellious attitude towards the people, talking about defending world order and Indonesian economic cooperation, but in reality, they are supporting the imperialist policy of slaughtering the Indonesian people. The leaders of the reformist unions not only did not oppose the first war of massacre against Indonesia launched by the Dutch government in 1947 and the second war in 1948, but also openly suppressed the Dutch workers' anger towards this war.

    We know that the Dutch reactionary trade unions visited the United States earlier this year with the support of the Dutch government. Under the instructions of US imperialism, they even said that the Indonesian liberation movement was only the demand of a few "bandits." These leaders of the Dutch reactionary trade unions surrendered to the Dutch reactionary government and US imperialism. These heads of reactionary trade unions, under the orders of their masters, attempted to infiltrate the World Federation of Trade Unions to serve their masters—imperialism, and attempted to undermine the World Federation of Trade Unions. But their plan completely failed. Their conspiracy did not play any role, they did not diminish the World Federation of Trade Unions' strength at all, nor did they manage to stop the Dutch workers from opposing the Dutch government's massacre of the Indonesian people.

    The Dutch trade union members under the leadership of the World Federation of Trade Unions have a very clear goal, which is to unconditionally support the Indonesian people's struggle for independence, freedom, and democracy. A few months ago, the Dutch United Trade Union, at its second congress held in Amsterdam, made the following demands to the round table conference jointly held by the Netherlands and Indonesia: (1) Immediately stop sending troops to Indonesia. (2) Demobilize several divisions of troops and send those demobilized troops back to the Netherlands immediately. (3) Immediately release all political prisoners. (4) Restore the freedom and sovereignty of Indonesian trade unions.

    As Saillant pointed out, the task of the Dutch working class is significant and arduous. The Dutch labor movement has four different centers, only the Dutch United Trade Union is formally a member of the World Federation of Trade Unions. But this cannot stop the upsurge of the workers' anti-colonial war movement. The parents, wives, and fiancées of the soldiers fighting in the Dutch-Indonesian war were the core of this movement, and they resolutely demanded the withdrawal of Dutch troops. In the Dutch army, this anti-slaughter war is also spreading. A few weeks ago, although the Dutch reactionary government set extremely heavy penalties for those troops who refused to board ships to Indonesia to carry out the massacre war, many soldiers still resisted at all costs. They condemned the colonial war, and this accusation gained the sympathy and support of the Dutch people.

    This Asian-Australasian Trade Union Conference must severely hit the imperialist policy of isolating the struggle of the colonial people. This isolation and division policy commonly used by imperialism has had a considerable effect for a certain period. The task of the World Federation of Trade Unions Asian Liaison Bureau, which will be established at this meeting, should not only be to help the organization and strengthening of trade unions in colonial or semi-colonial countries, nor should it only be to report the activities of the World Federation of Trade Unions to Asian and Australasian workers; it should also constantly report to the world the position of workers in colonial and semi-colonial countries in the overall situation. This kind of reporting can expose the lies that have blinded a considerable number of workers in capitalist countries.

    The struggle of the working class around the world is indivisible. Especially the workers in colonies and capitalist countries directly under their rule, they are subjected to the oppression of the same enemy—a few capitalists—every day. The Dutch United Trade Union and Dutch workers will further strengthen their integration with the Indonesian people's liberation struggle in the future. I especially pay tribute to the Indonesian trade union representatives, and this respect represents tens of millions of Dutch men and women workers who, like their Indonesian comrades, are resolutely fighting against imperialism.

　　荷兰职工领袖勃罗克萨尔报告
　　坚决支持印尼解放斗争
    【新华社北京二十日电】世界工会联合会副主席、荷兰职工领袖勃罗克萨尔，今天在亚澳工会会议上发表演说，支持印尼工会代表马佐诺所作的关于印尼工会情况以及他们为民族独立、自由而斗争的报告。勃罗克萨尔演说的要点如下：
    印尼代表在报告中指出，印尼人民的民主、自由与独立完全被剥夺了。整个的印尼劳动人民受到了美帝国主义以及荷兰帝国主义凶暴的压榨。荷兰工人阶级对于这种情况不能够亦不应该采取被动的态度，必须要有一个坚定的立场。
    现在对于印尼的情况，存在着两种不同的态度。一种是支持由美国国务院指挥、由波兰政府执行的殖民地政策；一种是无条件支持印尼的民族解放运动。在世界工联总书记赛扬的报告中，已经说到，那些改良分子所组织的工会所走的道路，就正是支持美帝国主义压迫印尼人民的道路。不消说，这些改良分子，现在还在企图隐藏他们反叛人民的态度，说什么保卫世界秩序和印尼的经济合作，但实际上他们是支持着帝国主义屠杀印尼人民的政策。改良主义工会的首领们，不仅不反对一九四七年荷兰政府第一次对印尼进行的屠杀战争和一九四八年的第二次战争，而且公然压制荷兰工人对于这个战争的气愤情绪。
    我们知道荷兰的反动工会在今年年初曾在荷兰政府的支持下访问美国。他们在美帝国主义授意下，居然说印尼的解放运动只是少数“匪徒”的要求。这些荷兰反动工会的领导者投降了荷兰的反动政府和美帝国主义。这些反动工会的头子在他们主人的命令下，企图混进世界工联来为他们的主人——帝国主义服务，并企图破坏世界工联。但他们的计划完全失败了。他们的阴谋并没有起丝毫作用，他们并没有减去世界工联的一点力量，也并没有作到能够阻止荷兰工人反对荷兰政府屠杀印尼人民的斗争。
    世界工联领导下的荷兰工会会员，目标非常明确，这就是无条件地支持印尼人民为独立、自由与民主而进行的斗争。数月前，荷兰联合工会，在阿姆斯特丹举行的第二次代表大会上，曾向荷兰及印尼共同举行的圆桌会议，提出下列要求：（一）立刻停止向印尼输送军队。（二）复员若干师军队，把那些复员的军队立刻从印尼送回荷兰。（三）立即释放一切政治犯。（四）恢复印尼工会的自由与主权。
    正如赛扬所指出的，荷兰工人阶级的任务是重大而艰苦的。荷兰工人运动有四个不同的中心，惟有荷兰联合工会是正式加入世界工联的。但这不能阻止工人反殖民地战争运动的高涨。在荷印作战的战士们的父母妻子及未婚妻们，曾是这个运动的核心，她们非常坚决地要求撤回荷兰军队。在荷兰军队中，这个反屠杀战争亦在蔓延着。数星期前，荷兰反动政府对于那些拒绝上船开向印尼进行屠杀战争的军队，虽然定出了极重的刑罚，但仍有许多士兵不顾一切加以反抗。他们控诉殖民战争，这种控诉获得了荷兰人民的同情与拥护。
    这一次亚澳工会会议，必定要针对帝国主义孤立殖民地人民斗争的政策给以严重打击。帝国主义惯用的这种孤立分化政策，在某一时期是有它的相当作用的。将在这个会上成立的世界工联亚洲联络局的任务，不应该仅仅是在帮助殖民地或半殖民地的工会的组织和加强这些组织，也不应该只是把世界工联的活动报告给亚澳工人；它还应该将殖民地、半殖民地的工人，在整个局势中所处的地位，经常的报道给全世界。这种报道，可以揭穿那些蒙蔽了资本主义国家内相当数量的工人的谎话。
    全世界工人阶级的斗争是不可分裂的。尤其是殖民地以及直接统治的资本主义国家内的工人，他们每天受着同一的敌人——少数资本家的压迫。荷兰联合工会以及荷兰工人今后将更加强与印尼人民解放斗争的结合。我特别向印尼工会代表致敬，这种敬意代表着数千万荷兰男女工人，他们都和他们的印尼同志一样，正对帝国主义进行着坚决的斗争。
