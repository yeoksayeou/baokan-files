[Report from this newspaper] Some districts and villages in Wuqing, Ninghe, Tianjin, Jinghai and other counties, and Shengfang town in Tianjin Special District, Hebei Province, committed some "leftist" errors in the production self-relief movement that infringed upon the interests of middle peasants. For example, in Wuqing County's Sixth, Seventh, Ninth, Eleventh, Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Districts, from this spring to the autumn harvest, errors occurred in which grain was forcibly borrowed from middle peasants and distributed to poor peasants. In Niuzhen Village, four middle peasants were detained for forcibly borrowing things from them. In Tianjin County's Seventh District, village cadres in six villages including Liujiamatou, lacking capital for managing fisheries, forcibly borrowed 73 *shi* of corn from middle peasants. Zhang Shuang, the director of the district farmers' association, not only did not stop this, but praised it as a "good method for production and disaster relief." In Ninghe County's Fifth District, Leshanzhuang, because middle peasants had boats for managing fisheries and were relatively wealthy, village cadres forced the middle peasants to take out 2,000 *jin* of red grain to distribute to poor peasants to buy nets. In Wuqing Fourth District's Shangxiaoting Village, 6,000 *jin* of grain were forcibly borrowed from middle peasants and distributed to revolutionary martyrs' and soldiers' families.

In organizing cooperatives, some areas violated the principles of democracy and voluntarism and the guiding principles of developing production, thereby infringing upon the interests of middle peasants. For example, in Ninghe County's Miaozhuang Village, 18 middle-peasant households were forced to contribute 41 *shi* of grain to the cooperative, counted as shares for poor and hired peasants and revolutionary martyrs' and soldiers' families.

These erroneous actions caused ideological unease among the masses. Some middle peasants ate and drank excessively and did not engage in production. Some not only did not plant wheat but also pushed land outwards. Some revolutionary martyrs' and soldiers' families increased their dependency mentality and were not active in production. This caused great damage to production and disaster relief.

The reasons for the above errors are mainly that some cadres in the local Party committees and governments have "leftist" sentiments, have not studied policies well, have not understood that only unity and production can overcome disasters, and have not recognized the violation of middle peasants as a matter of principle that destroys policy. Now, the counties concerned have begun to examine and correct the errors.

　　河北武清等县在生产自救中
　　侵犯中农妨害生产
　　现已开始注意纠正
    【本报讯】河北天津专区武清、宁河、天津、静海等县及胜芳镇的某些区村，在生产自救运动中，曾发生了一些侵犯中农利益的左倾错误。如武清县六、七、九、十一、十三、十四、十五等区，从今春到秋收，曾先后发生强借中农粮食分给贫农的错误现象。牛镇村为强借中农的东西，曾扣中农四人。天津县七区刘家码头等六个村的村干部，因治鱼缺乏本钱，就向中农强借玉米七十三石，该区农会主任张双知道后，不但不加制止，反而表扬为“生产救灾的好办法”。宁河县五区乐善庄，因中农有船治鱼，生活比较富裕，村干部就硬叫中农们拿出两千斤红粮，分给贫农买网。武清四区上小汀村，强向中农借粮六千斤，分给了烈军工属。
    在组织合作社当中，有的违背了民主自愿的原则和发展生产的方针，侵犯了中农利益。如宁河县苗枣庄，强迫十八户中农，拿出四十一石粮食入合作社，算做贫雇农和烈军工属的股金。
    以上这些错误行动，造成群众思想不安，有的中农大吃大喝，不事生产，有的不仅不种麦子，反而向外推地，有的烈军工属，更增加了依赖思想，也不积极生产。给生产救灾以极大的损害。
    产生以上错误的原因，主要是当地党委及政府中有些干部存在着左倾情绪，没有好好学习政策，没有了解只有团结生产才能渡过灾荒，没有把侵犯中农提到破坏政策的原则高度来认识。现在各该县已开始检讨并纠正错误。
