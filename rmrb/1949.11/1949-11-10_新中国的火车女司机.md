　　New China's Female Train Drivers
　　Huashan
　　Tian Guiying, the leading figure among the first group of female train drivers in New China, was born into a poor fisherman's family. From the age of seven until now at twenty, she has supported herself entirely with her own hands. She has fished, caught crabs, and gathered oysters, and worked in several factories. In short, she is a good worker. But what has she dreamed of day and night for more than a decade? Let her tell you herself:
　　"Since childhood, I have worked hard, only hoping to save some money to buy silk thread and embroider a dowry pillow. - At that time, being able to please a man meant that I would have support for the rest of my life."
　　This is what she said in February at the Dalian Railway Bureau's Locomotive Depot's employee night school. At that time, the night school was giving political lessons, and the teacher was Director Li, who had worked for twenty-one years. When he talked about his mother, he said: "...She and my father suffered hardship and toil all their lives, cooking, mending clothes, sewing shoes, picking up coal cinders, raising a large group of children, and still being beaten by her husband without any way to vent her anger. Don't underestimate household labor; it's no easier than working in a factory. But in the end, it's always relying on others to live. In the old society, workers were oppressed, and workers' families were even more oppressed by men." Tian Guiying was not afraid of strong winds and waves, nor was she afraid of the cold of winter, and she had never shed tears while going to the sea hungry. But these words made her cry: for more than ten years, she dreamed of saving some money, but it was only for buying a slave status! Director Li said: "Women can only truly be liberated by participating in social labor." Tian Guiying then requested to become a lathe worker and learn a skill.
　　Director Li said: "You can't do it! Being a lathe worker is not as easy as selling meal tickets in the cafeteria. Besides, you can earn four or five thousand yuan a month in the cafeteria, and you don't have to spend money on food and you can still receive a ration of grain. Being a lathe apprentice won't leave any money for your family."
　　These words were also true. It has been three years since Dalian was liberated, and Tian Guiying has also worked in the factory for three years. Every day, she only calculates on finding a light job that earns more money. Anyway, she should be getting married soon, so she doesn't want to become a dirty little boy who can't find a good husband. Now that her mind has changed, she is determined to learn heavy industrial technology. Money is no longer a consideration, and the factory has also changed in her eyes: she no longer thinks the lathe workers covered in grease are dirty, and she is no longer afraid of the rumbling sound of the locomotive. She couldn't help laughing when she saw the driver's black face before, but now she feels that those black arms are better than others'. When the higher-ups didn't agree to let her go to the factory, she clung to Director Li whenever she had the chance and begged him. One day, she saw photos of Soviet women driving trains in the club, and Tian Guiying and several female companions jumped up and said excitedly, "How can Chinese women be so capable!"
　　Soviet Director Lisov said: "In the Soviet Union, there are many women who drive trains, fly airplanes, and drive tanks. This is unimaginable in capitalist society. Only the people's country will seriously cultivate the children of the working people. As long as we are determined to educate and train them, Chinese women can completely participate in heavy industrial labor like Soviet women." Lisov came to the locomotive depot last January and, in half a year, selected forty-odd young female workers to work in the lathe, welding, boiler factory, chemical laboratory, light oil garage, and vehicle assembly factory. At the end of May this year, he proposed a plan to train female train drivers to the higher-ups.
　　Tian Guiying wanted to sign up for the exam, but her father said: "What are you learning that for? Just muddle through for a few more days and you'll be getting married." When she went to the hospital for a physical examination, some doctors said: "Your locomotive depot is just messing around. No matter how good a woman's physique is, it's not as good as a man's!" She and five female companions signed up together, and some disgruntled crew members said: "If women can do this, what do we men have to do? We're so tired after work that if we're not spitting blood, it's too late to quit." Driving a train is indeed not easy. It requires great strength and precise work, and the lives and materials of dozens of carriages are all in your hands. But Tian Guiying firmly said to her female companions: "If we don't learn to drive trains, none of us should get married. As long as the boys can do it, we girls can do it too. Now that we have the cultivation of the Communist Party and the Communist Youth League, and the enthusiastic help of the Soviet elder brother, why shouldn't we learn?"
　　There are three types of work on a locomotive: fireman, stoker, and driver. If you want to drive, you have to learn from the beginning. Before getting on the train, you have to learn to use a shovel. On the first day of practicing shoveling coal, several tons of coal looked like a big grave. You have to shovel it all into the furnace mouth shovel by shovel, and after shoveling it in, you shovel it out shovel by shovel. After shoveling it empty, you shovel it back in shovel by shovel. Afraid of failing the exam, they used all their strength. They shoveled back and forth all day, and their heads and faces were black, becoming black boys. They were so sore all over at night that they couldn't sleep, but they got up and practiced as usual in the morning. For three days in a row, they didn't say a word. When the director asked, they always smiled and said: "Not tired! It's nothing!"
　　The Soviet director was very satisfied and encouraged them, saying: "Without exercise, women's bodies won't get better. You have to set an example for Chinese women." Turning around, he said to others: "We must take good care of their health and not treat them the same as men." Their position was trainee fireman, and Lisov requested the higher-ups to pay them according to the stoker's salary, and to allocate an extra four hundred pounds of rice to improve their living conditions. In addition, it was stipulated that they should rest one day for every day they worked, and they must take leave when they were not feeling well. Afraid that it would be hot on the train and they wouldn't be able to eat, Director Li repeatedly told them: "This is hard work. If you work on an empty stomach, you will hurt your body. Even if you don't want to eat, you have to force yourself to eat. You will be able to eat more in a few days." Afraid that they would be naughty and disobedient, Director Li had to personally check their lunch boxes every day: they were not allowed to get on the train if they were not full. Before they started working, the director first considered whether the drivers they followed had good skills and whether they would cultivate people; the drivers were not allowed to bully them on the train and say stimulating things like "Women can't get on the locomotive." The director instructed the drivers to take good care of them when the locomotive was running on curves, up and down slopes, and over switches, and not to let them stand at the train door, not to let them pour out furnace ash halfway, and he regarded these as orders, saying: "Once they get on the train, it's your business, and you will be fully responsible if there is any danger!"
　　The higher-ups cared about them so much that some crew members who couldn't understand said: "They're getting paid the same as those who have worked for several years after only working for two days; what do we men have to do at the locomotive depot!" There were a lot of strange things said. Lisov held a meeting for the crew members and said: "If men don't care about cultivating women, they don't care about their own interests; a family of seven or eight people all rely on one person to eat, and no matter how much money you earn, you can't eat well! If we pull all the housewives onto the production front and they earn money to support their families, it will be like liberating the men as well. The male comrades of our Dalian Locomotive Depot should cultivate them well and set an example for the whole of China for women to participate in heavy industry."
　　Hero driver Li Qingrong said: "When the Japanese were here, who of us men could drive? Wasn't it the Communist Party and the Soviet elder brother who raised us up with one hand? The female comrades are so enthusiastic about learning, I must have the determination to cultivate them successfully!" Tian Guiying was very happy when she followed Li Qingrong for the first time. But she couldn't stand still when the train started. She held onto the railing with both hands and couldn't shovel coal; she held on with one hand and held the shovel with the other, and she couldn't exert any strength. Finally, she gritted her teeth and freed both hands, but she was able to stand firm. At this time, she was so excited that all her strength ran to the shovel, and she tried to throw big pieces of good coal into the furnace, fearing that she would not be able to generate steam and delay the big event. She burned up the big slope. But after calculating it back, she realized that she had burned an extra ton of coal in three hours. The hero driver said: "Being a fireman requires familiarity with the route. You have to add coal quickly when you're going uphill, and when you're going downhill, the steam is enough without adding coal; remember the slopes and flat roads clearly, and it's easier to burn and saves coal." - After learning this for half a month, the higher-ups let them rest and take technical lessons. The director selected four good drivers to give them lectures on the three major structures of the locomotive, signals, and operating procedures every day; Lisov also squeezed in time to personally lecture them on the principles of the locomotive once a week. He was afraid that the translation would not be good, so he specially found a hero driver to listen in and correct the errors in the translation sentence by sentence.
　　Everyone hoped that they would learn successfully as soon as possible, and they themselves were even more anxious. After learning a little today, they couldn't wait to go to the train for practice tomorrow, and they kept asking the higher-ups to let them follow the train as soon as possible. The Soviet director took care of their health and did not agree; they secretly colluded with the driver and got on the train. Tian Guiying was severely criticized by the higher-ups for this matter, and she was also asked to write a "justification" for disobeying the order. Lisov said: "If you wear out your bodies, you will not only let down the cultivation of all the comrades, but also cause women to lose confidence in participating in heavy industrial labor. As long as you maintain constant efforts, I guarantee that we will be able to train several Chinese female drivers by the next "March 8th"!"
　　When it came to the exam, the director of the railway bureau, the chief engineer, and many Soviet experts and technicians wanted to see their results in person. Including the director, the hero driver, and the male and female translators, there were one or two times more invigilators than students. This one tested one sentence, and that one tested one sentence, almost asking about the entire locomotive. As a result, except for two new participants, six female firemen were promoted to trainee stokers. Lisov was very happy and personally took the six of them to work the next day. For thirty-three kilometers, pulling a passenger train, the old driver and Lisov were sitting on the side watching them drive. The first one to drive was Tian Guiying. She was both happy and anxious, and her heart panicked when she passed a switch. The old driver hurriedly ran up to take over, but Lisov stopped him and said: "Don't mind her, you can go up when she can't do it anymore. They won't make progress if you don't let go."
　　The train passed through the fields, and the Soviet Red Army soldiers who were repairing the road waved to them and applauded; as soon as the train entered the station, the Soviet passengers immediately ran over to shake hands with them and congratulate them. Once, they followed the train to Wafangdian, and the old stationmaster there said that he would also recruit female crew members soon; the news of them spread to various parts of the Northeast, and women far away in North Manchuria also wrote letters asking to learn to drive with them. When I went to visit Tian Guiying at the end of October, all six of them had been promoted to formal stokers. Tian Guiying said: "Now I only want to pass the exam to become a formal driver on the next "March 8th"."

　　新中国的火车女司机
    华山
    田桂英，新中国第一批火车女司机的头把手，出身于贫苦的渔民家庭，从七岁到现在二十岁全凭两手养家。她捕过鱼，抓过蟹，捞过海蛎子，在好几个工厂作过工，一句话：是个好劳动。可是她十几年来所日夜梦想的是什么呢？听她自己说吧：
    “自幼勤苦干活，只盼剩点钱买丝线绣个出阁枕头。——那时候能讨男人欢心，一辈子总算有依靠了。”
    这是她二月间在大连铁路局机务段职工夜校说出来的。那时候夜校正讲政治课，教员是做了二十一年工的李段长，他讲到自己的母亲时说：“……她跟我父亲受穷受累一辈子，做饭，补衣、衲鞋、拾煤核，养一大群小孩还要挨丈夫揍着没场出冤气。别看家庭劳动，不比工厂里轻快，说起来总是靠人过日子；在旧社会里工人受压迫，工人家属就还要受男人的压迫。”田桂英不怕大风浪，也不怕腊月寒，饿着肚子下海去没掉过眼泪。这番话却把她说哭了：十几年来做梦也想剩几个钱，原来只是为的买个奴隶身份哪！李段长说：“妇女要真正解放，只有参加社会劳动。”田桂英就要求当镟盘工，学习一门技术。
    李段长说：“你不行！镟盘工可不比在食堂卖饭票松快。再说你在食堂一个月能挣四、五千元，吃饭不花钱还能领份配给粮。当镟盘学徒就不能给家剩几个钱了。”
    这话可也是说的实情。大连解放三年了，田桂英到工厂也干了三年了，天天只盘算找个多挣钱的轻快活。反正再混些时就该出阁，别弄成个脏小子模样不好找婆家。现在心思一变，决心要学习重工业技术，钱不钱早扔到一边，工厂在自己眼里也变了样子：浑身油腻的镟盘工瞅起来不嫌脏了，雷声嗡嗡的火车头听着也不害怕了。早先看见司机的黑嘴脸忍不住笑，现在看那双黑胳膊就觉着比别人的好。上级不答应她下工厂，她找个空就缠住李段长请求。有一天在俱乐部看到苏联妇女开火车的照片，田桂英和几个女伴急的跳起来说：“咱们中国的妇女多＠才能这样呢！”
    苏联段长李索夫说：“在苏联，妇女开火车驾飞机、坦克有的是。这是资本主义社会所不能想象的。只有人民的国家才会认真培养劳动人民的儿女。只要决心教育培养，中国妇女完全可以和苏联妇女一样参加重工业劳动。”李索夫去年一月来到机务段，半年中就选拔了四十几个青年女工到镟盘、电焊部门、锅炉厂、化学试验室、轻油车库、对车（车辆合成）厂工作。今年五月末又向上级提出培养女火车司机的计划。
    田桂英要报名投考，她父亲说：“学那个干啥？再对付干几天就该出阁了。”到医院检查体格，有的医生说：“你们机务段尽闹着玩，女人体格再好也不如男人哪！”她和五个女伴一块报了名，有的看不顺眼的乘务员就说：“女人能干这个，世界上还要男人干什么？我们一下班还累的那样，赶到吐了血再不干就晚了。”开火车的确不是容易的事情，出大力气，干精细活，几十车皮的人命物资全在自己手里。可是田桂英坚决地和女伴们说：“不学会开火车咱们谁也别出阁，只要小子们能干的活咱们闺女就干得了。现在有了共产党和青年团的培养，又有苏联老大哥热心帮助，我们为什么不学呢？”
    机车上有三种工作：当火夫、司炉、司机，想开车就得从头往上学。不等上车先得学会使铁锨。头一天练习投炭，好几吨煤象座大坟堆，得一锨锨把它全投进炉口里，投完了又一锨锨掏出来，掏空了又一锨锨地往里投。生怕考不及格，他们有多大劲就使多大劲。来回投了一整天，满头满脸黑得成了个黑小子。晚上浑身疼的睡不着觉，但清晨起来又照样练习。一连三天她们没有哼一声，段长问起来，她们总是笑嘻嘻地说：“不累！啥也没啥！”
    苏联段长很满意，鼓励她们说：“不锻炼妇女的身体好不起来；你们要给中国妇女做出个榜样。”回过头却对其他人说：“要好好照顾她们的健康，不能和男人一般看待。”她们的职务是见习火夫，李索夫请求上级按照司炉的工资发给，额外配给四百斤大米改善生活。此外规定她们上班一天休息一天，身体不好时一定要请假。害怕车上热，吃不下饭，李段长三番五次告诉她们：“这是出力气的活，空着肚子干要累伤身子，不想吃也要勉强吃，过些天就能多吃饭了。”还怕她们淘气，不听话，李段长每天总要亲自检查她们的饭盒：不盛满不准上车。开始上班以前，段长先考虑了她们跟的司机技术好不好，会不会培养人；不准司机在车上欺负她们，说些“女人上不了火车头”之类的刺激话。机车跑弯道，上下坡和过道岔时最好摇晃，段长就嘱咐司机好生关照管束，别让她们站到车门口，别让她们在半道倾炉灰，并把这些当成命令说：“她们上了车就是你们的事，出了危险你们负全责！”
    上级这样关心她们，有些想不通的乘务员就说：“才干两天就和干几年的一样拿钱；机务段还要男人干什么！”怪话很多。李索夫就给乘务员们开会说：“男子不关心培养妇女，就是不关心自己的利益；一家子老婆孩子七八口人全指望一个人吃饭，你们挣的钱再多也吃不好啊！如果把家庭妇女都拉到生产战线上，一样挣钱养家，就等于把男人也解放出来了。我们大连机务段的男同志应该好好培养她们，给全中国做出个妇女参加重工业的榜样。”
    英雄司机李庆荣说：“日本在时咱们男人谁个会开车来？还不是共产党和苏联老大哥一手提起来的？女同志这样热心学习，我就要有决心把她们培养成功！”田桂英第一次跟班，刚好跟上李庆荣，心里说不出的高兴。但车一开动却站不住了，两手把住栏杆，没法锨煤；一手把住一手拿锨，使不上劲。最后她一咬牙就腾出了两只手来，可也就站稳脚根了。这时他兴奋得浑身的劲全跑到铁锨上头，尽挑大块好煤往炉里扔，生怕烧不上汽耽误大事。老大的坡道也烧上去了。可是回来后算一下，才知道在三个钟头里多烧了一吨煤。英雄司机说：“当火夫要熟悉线路，该上坡就得猛添煤，该下坡不添煤蒸气也够用了；记清楚坡道平道，烧起来省劲还能省煤。”——这末着学了半个月，上级又让她们歇工来专上技术课。段长挑选了四个好司机，每天给她们讲机车三大构造、信号和运转规程；李索夫每星期还挤时间亲自给她们讲授一次机车原理。他怕翻译不内行，又特别找英雄司机在旁边听着，一句句地给翻译校正错误。
    大家都盼她们赶快学成功，她们自己更性急。今天学了一点恨不能明天就上车实习，老向上级请求赶快让她们跟车跑班。苏联段长照顾她们的健康，没答应；她们悄悄串通司机便上车走了。田桂英因为这事受到上级严厉的批评，还要她写一份违抗命令的“理由书”。李索夫说：“你们把身体累坏了，不但对不起全体同志的培养，而且会使得妇女们失掉参加重工业劳动的信心。只要你们保持经常的努力，我保证在明年“三八”节能够培养出几个中国女司机来！”
    临到考试时，又是铁路局长，又是总工程师，好多苏联专家技师都要亲自看看她们的成绩。加上段长，英雄司机和男女翻译，监考的人比学生还多一两倍。这个考一句，那个考一句，几乎把整个机车都问遍了。结果，除了两个新参加的以外，六个女火夫都被提升为见习司炉。李索夫非常高兴，第二天亲自带上她们六个去上班。三十三公里，拉一列客车，老司机和李索夫都在一旁坐着看他们开。第一个开车的就是田桂英。她又是高兴，又是着急，猛一过岔道心就慌了。老司机赶忙跑上去接手，李索夫却一把拦住说：“别管她，不行了你再上去，放不开手她们是不会进步的。”
    列车穿过田野，正在修道的苏联红军直向她们招手叫好；列车刚一进站，苏联乘客马上跑来抢着跟她们握手道喜。有一次她们跟车到了瓦房店，那里的老站长就不多久也要招考女乘务员；她们的消息传到东北各地，远在北满的妇女也来信要求跟她们一起学开车。十月末我去访问田桂英时，她们六个已升为正式司炉。田桂英说：“我现在一心只想在明年“三八”节能考上正式司机”。
