    Yanjing Paper Mill
    Rewards Model Workers
    [Beijing News] The Yanjing Paper Mill held a general meeting of all staff on the 8th of this month to summarize work in September and October, and to award model labor units and individuals. At the meeting, the factory director made a summary report on the two-month competition, pointing out that in the past two months, not only has the product quality gradually improved (unqualified products accounted for 17% in September, but only 9% in October), but also the production efficiency has increased (it took 10.06 minutes to make one ream of paper in September, but only 9.93 minutes in October), and as a result, sales have also improved. Then, awards were given to twelve individual models, including Liu Xigong, Ji Qingxuan, and Zhang Maosheng, and three model teams: the Engineering Section, the Iron Workshop, and the No. 2 Paper Machine Team. Each model worker was awarded a pair of sports shoes, and each model team was awarded a framed mirror. These individual models and team models worked actively and obeyed discipline. For example, Ji Qingxuan, the leader of the Iron Workshop, often inspects machines, cares for the factory, and contributes equipment. Recently, although his child died of illness and he owed the factory a lot of money, he did not sell the equipment (worth over 100,000 yuan) to exchange for money, but donated it to the factory.

    燕京造纸
    奖励模范
    【北京讯】燕京造纸厂于本月八日举行全体职员大会，总结九、十两月工作，并给劳动模范单位和个人发奖。会上由厂长作两个月竞赛的总结报告，指出两月来不但产品质量逐渐提高（九月份不合格的产品占百分之十七，十月份只占百分之九），而且生产效率也增加了（九月造一令纸需时一○·零六分，十月只需时九·九三分），因之销路也已好转。接着给这次选出的刘锡功、季庆萱、张茂生等十二位个人模范和工务股、铁工班、抄纸第二班三个模范班发奖。奖给每个模范工人运动球鞋一双，每个模范班镜框一个，这些个人模范与班模范工作积极，遵守纪律。如铁工班长季庆萱，经常检查机器，爱护工厂，献交器材，最近虽然他小孩病死，欠工厂不少钱，可是他并未把器材（约值十万余元）出卖换钱，而献给了工厂。
