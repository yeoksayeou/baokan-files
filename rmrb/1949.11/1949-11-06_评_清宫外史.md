　　Review of "Unofficial History of the Qing Court"
　　Peng Ming
　　I. On the Theme
　　The theme of a historical drama is first and foremost a matter of historical perspective. Although the theme of "Unofficial History of the Qing Court" appears vague due to the interweaving of many fragmented stories, we can grasp a thread: that it reflects the struggle between the Emperor's faction and the Empress Dowager's faction within the Qing government during the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-95. Several viewpoints in the play regarding this historical subject are worth discussing.
　　During the Sino-Japanese War, the Emperor's faction (Zai Tian – i.e., Emperor Guangxu, Weng Tonghe, Zhang Jian, etc.) advocated war, while the Empress Dowager's faction (Nara – i.e., Empress Dowager Cixi, Li Hongzhang, etc.) advocated peace. The Emperor's faction advocated war to weaken the Empress Dowager's faction in the conflict; the Empress Dowager's faction advocated peace to preserve their own strength. Both factions were vying for power through war and peace, which was an internal struggle within the ruling class. Although their views differed, they were united in their harm to the country and the people. This is the view of the struggle between the Emperor and the Empress Dowager (see Fan Wenlan's "Modern Chinese History").
　　The playwright did not grasp this point sufficiently. The author concentrated on depicting the private lives and infighting of the Emperor and Empress Dowager, with every move and gesture described in great detail. While this allows the audience to learn more about life in the palace, it inevitably leaves the impression that if Nara (Empress Dowager Cixi) had been more enlightened, if the eunuch Li Lianying had not been so tyrannical, if the ministers had been united, and if Zai Tian (Emperor Guangxu) had gained power, the country could have been saved.
　　II. The Issue of Stance
　　The playwright depicts Zai Tian (Emperor Guangxu) as a very sympathetic character, and portrays the eunuch Kou Liancai's loyalty to his master to the point of self-sacrifice as the climax of the play. This further obscures the theme of the play, and such promotion of feudal morality is harmful to the people.
　　Zai Tian was relatively intelligent among the Manchu aristocracy. But what was his purpose? Was it for the people? Of course not. As he said to Nara (Empress Dowager Cixi), everything he did was for the "state" and for the "ancestral shrines." What good did this do for the people? What is there to sympathize with? As for his pro-war figures, they were nothing more than officials who engaged in empty talk of "respecting the sovereign and resisting the barbarians." They had no way to defeat Japan (such as Weng Tonghe). Those who had a way only advocated "allying with England to attack the Japanese" (such as Zhi Rui, Zhang Zhidong). Was this much better than Li Hongzhang's "allying with Russia to resist Japan?" They were all trying to expand their own power and consolidate their rule over the people. Their advocacy of war cannot be equated with the people's advocacy of war.
　　As for Kou Liancai's self-sacrifice for his master, the author depicts it vividly, indeed catering to the backward feudal consciousness of some of the audience. When Kou Liancai "passionately" shouted "loyal ministers are not afraid of death, those afraid of death are not loyal" before his death, a section of the audience applauded enthusiastically. When he respectfully kowtowed to Zai Tian (Guangxu) and Nara (Empress Dowager Cixi), and said things like "Let Liancai kowtow to the Old Buddha before he dies, so as not to betray the years of nurturing...", the audience applauded again, and some even cried, it is said. Kou Liancai's acting was indeed not bad. If he were playing a character who expressed loyalty to the people and to the spirit of revolution, he would have received more widespread resonance and given the masses a great education. But unfortunately, he was playing a slave loyal to the feudal ruling class. The better the acting, the greater the harm to the people. There is a Peking opera called "The Ninth Watch" (Ma Yi Saves His Master), which promotes feudal morality and is already on the list of banned programs. Kou Liancai and Ma Yi in "The Ninth Watch" are characters of the same type.
　　In addition, there are some other problems, such as the treatment of Li Hongzhang. In the play, he is portrayed as a "decent" figure who knows himself and his enemy, is very perceptive, and very cautious. This is also inappropriate. As everyone knows, Li Hongzhang was the founding father of the Beiyang warlords. His so-called strengthening of the navy and army at that time had no intention of resisting foreign aggression. He used the navy and army as a private tool to guard his territory. His advocacy of peace was to preserve the Beiyang territory. This point is not explained at all in the play. There is also the issue of evaluating the Zhonghe Society, which is also worth studying.
　　The fundamental problem is one of stance. From the perspective of the old ruling class, Nara (Empress Dowager Cixi) was bad, and Zai Tian (Emperor Guangxu) was good. From the perspective of the people, they were both old ruling classes. Although there should be some distinction, as a class, they were both reactionary. It is not a question of admiration or sympathy for them, but of using a historical perspective to expose, analyze, and criticize them.
　　III. A Suggestion
　　According to newspaper reports and the play's description, this is the first part of "Unofficial History of the Qing Court" – "Guangxu's Reign," and the second part is "The Hundred Days' Reform." I sincerely suggest that the playwright and actors find some history books with more correct viewpoints and study this issue carefully, so as not to turn the "Hundred Days' Reform" into a "bourgeois revolution" ("Unofficial History of the Qing Court" part 1).
　　The Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consulative Conference clearly states in its cultural and educational policies: "The culture and education of the People's Republic of China shall be new-democratic, that is, national,

### 评“清宫外史”

　　评“清宫外史”
    彭明
  　一、关于主题思想
    历史剧的主题思想，首先是一个历史观点问题。“清宫外史”的主题虽然因为许多零碎故事的穿插，显得模糊，但是我们可以捉到一个线索：即它是反映了在一八九四——九五年中日战争时期中，满清政府内部的帝党与后党之争的。在这一历史题材中，剧本的若干观点是值得商讨的。
    在中日战争中，帝党（载＠——即光绪帝、翁同和、张謇等）是主战的；后党（那拉氏——即西太后、李鸿章等）是主和的。帝党主战，是要在战争中削弱后党；后党主和，是要保存自己的实力。两派借和战争夺权利，都是统治阶级内部的斗争，主张虽异，其同为祸国殃民则一。这是对帝后之争的看法（详见范文澜所著“中国近代史”）。
    剧本的作者，对这一点是掌握不够的。作者集中精力描写了帝后的私生活及其倾轧，一举一动表现得非常详尽，这让观众多了解一些宫廷的生活，自然也是可以的。但是问题在于让人看过之后，总有那么一种感觉，即：如果那拉氏（西太后）开明一些，太监李连英不那么专横，大臣们齐心，载＠（光绪帝）得势，国家还是有救的。
  　二、立场问题
    剧作者把载＠（光绪帝）描写成为很值得同情的人物，并且把太监寇连材的奴才殉主，描写得成了该剧的高峰，这就更模糊了剧的主题；而这种对于封建道德的宣扬，对人民来说，则是有害的。
    载＠在满洲皇族中是较有头脑的。但是他的目的何在呢？是为了人民吗？当然不是的。正如他对那拉氏（西太后）所说的那样：他的一切做为，都是为了“社稷”，都是为了“祖先的灵庙”。这对人民有什么好处呢？这有什么值得同情的呢？至于他的主战派的人物，也不过是些空谈“尊主攘夷”的官僚，如何战胜日本，他们并无办法，（如翁同和），有办法的也说明书）。
    只是“联英伐倭”（如志锐、张之洞），这比李鸿章的“联俄（指旧俄）拒日”又好了多少呢？他们都是为了扩大自己的实力，稳固自己对人民的统治。他们的主战，是不能与人民的主战相提并论的。
    至于寇连材的奴才殉主，作者把它描写得有声有色，确实迎合了一部分观众的落后的封建意识。在寇连材死前“慷慨激昂”的喊出“忠臣不怕死，怕死不为忠”的时候，一部分观众热烈的鼓掌了；在他必恭必敬的向载＠（光绪）、那拉氏（西太后）叩了头，并且还说了些什么“让连材临死前给老佛爷磕个头，也不负养育一场……”等等报恩的话，观众又是一阵鼓掌，据说还有的哭了。寇连材演的确实不坏，若作为表现忠于人民忠于革命的气节角色，那他会得到更多更普遍的共鸣，会给群众很大的教育。但可惜他是在扮演忠于封建统治阶级的奴才，演技愈好，对人民来说，害处愈大。京剧中有一出叫“九更天”（马义救主）的戏，是宣扬封建道德的，已在禁演节目之列了。寇连材与“九更天”中的马义，是同一类型中的人物。
    此外，还有些问题，如对李鸿章的处理，剧中把他表现为一个知已知彼、非常有眼光、非常慎重的“正派”人物，这也是不恰当的。大家都知道，李鸿章是北洋军阀的开山老祖，他当时的所谓练海陆军自强，毫无对外之意，他是把海陆军作为看守地盘的私人工具的，他的主和就是要保全北洋地盘。这点在剧中是一点没有交代的。还有对与中会的估价问题，也是值得研究的。
    基本的问题是一个立场的问题。站在旧的统治阶级立场上看，那拉氏（西太后）是坏的，载＠（光绪帝）是好的。若站在人民的立场上来看，他们则都是旧的统治阶级，虽然应有所分别，但作为一个阶级来说，他们都是反动的。对他们不是赞赏、同情的问题，而是用历史眼光，加以揭露、分析与批判的问题。
　　三、一点建议
    根据报载及该剧说明书，说这是“清宫外史”的上集——“光绪亲政记”；还有下集是“戊戌政变记”。我诚恳的建议该剧的作者与演员们，找几本观点比较正确的历史书，把这个问题好好研究一下，以免再把“戊戌政变”弄成为“资产阶级的革命”（“清宫外史”上集）
    政协共同纲领的文化教育政策上写得清楚：“中华人民共和国的文化教育为新民主主义的，即民族的、科学的、大众的文化教育。……肃清封建的、买办的、法西斯主义的思想，发展为人民服务的思想”（第四十一条）“提倡用科学的历史观点，研究和解释历史……”（第四十四条）“提倡文学艺术为人民服务，启发人民的政治觉悟，鼓励人民的劳动热情，奖励优秀的文学艺术作品，发展人民的戏剧电影事业”（第四十五条）。
    我建议民艺剧团好好的把共同纲领学习一下，把一些不合乎文教政策的剧本，彻底改造一番；并且多创造一些合乎政策的剧本。只有这样才是对人民有利的，只有这样才会有发展前途的。希望多多研究剧本的主题思想，要告诉观众一些什么？赞成什么？反对什么？明确起来。不然，主题搞不对头，任凭演员如何努力，都将是徒劳无功的。
