Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 5th – The East China Military Region Headquarters of the People's Liberation Army announced the results of the September anti-bandit campaign, stating that throughout the month, various field armies and local armed forces, in anti-bandit operations, eliminated a total of 9,591 Nationalist Party bandits and special agent armed forces. Among these, 5,202 bandits were captured, 3,574 surrendered, including 58 bandit officers of the rank of colonel or higher, and 815 bandits were killed or wounded, including the "Commander of the Zhejiang Column of the Anti-Communist National Salvation Army," Xu Zhendong, and seven other bandit leaders who were killed. The captured materials included 11 60mm mortars, 3 mortars and small cannons, 20 grenade launchers, 13 rifle grenades, 163 light and heavy machine guns, 68 submachine guns, 51 Thompson and carbine rifles, 6,286 rifles and pistols, and other ammunition and supplies.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng, 5th – When a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army was suppressing bandits in the Tongbai Mountains, it adopted a centralized training approach to transform captured and registered repentant bandits, achieving initial success. In the third phase of this unit's bandit training, 320 people participated. At the beginning of the training, the bandits had several different concerns and worries. The ringleaders with serious crimes feared execution; the coerced followers feared being forced into military service; and those from families lacking labor feared the training period would be too long.

At the start of the training, education was first conducted on the People's Liberation Army's policy towards bandit and puppet personnel: "The chief culprits must be punished, the coerced followers will not be questioned, and those who perform meritorious service will be rewarded," dispelling the ideological concerns of most people and initially stabilizing their emotions. After implementing policy education, current affairs education was conducted, explaining the strength of the People's Liberation Army and the victorious situation of the national liberation war, exposing the rumors of bandits and special agents, and initially discovering the more active individuals among the coerced bandit followers. Following this, they were encouraged to recount their suffering from poverty and being forced into banditry. Based on these accounts of suffering, efforts were made to win over and transform the coerced followers, isolate the ringleaders, and separate the ringleaders from the coerced followers. As a result, 62 ringleaders and special agents, both major and minor, were identified and formed into a "Military Control Platoon" to be placed under control. Afterwards, the coerced bandit followers were mobilized to make accusations, which, combined with interrogation work, led to the discovery of the leaders of the special agent organizations, such as bandit battalion commander Chen and company commander Wang, who had committed heinous crimes.

Subsequently, a struggle against the bandit leaders was launched, targeting these individuals. After the coerced bandit followers presented numerous facts about Chen's crimes, Chen still refused to confess and tried to deny everything, infuriating the bandit followers. Wang Jincheng, a repentant follower, immediately said, "You didn't want to be the battalion commander, but when bandit Wang ×× fled south, why did you come back? You ordered me to become a bandit; if I didn't, you threatened to kill my whole family." Mo, a repentant follower, said, "You said the Huanglian Tree family was communicating with the Eighth Route Army, a family of seven, and you told me to dig a pit and bury them all. I refused, but you forced me with a gun, even a one-year-old child had to be buried alive in the pit. Is that true or not?" Through such accusations and struggles against the bandit leaders by the coerced followers, it was revealed that Chen alone had killed 63 people and raped over 150 women, and instigated bandits to "not surrender weapons when surrendering, and not confess when repenting," committing crimes such as feigning surrender, false confession, and false registration to the People's Liberation Army. Finally, through this struggle and in conjunction with the interrogation of Chen, it was discovered that Chen was the local head of the special agent organization, with a total of four headquarters and twenty groups. Based on the clues obtained, the People's Liberation Army finally dismantled the entire organization, seizing two machine guns, one small cannon, and sixty rifles.

After this struggle and education, the majority of the coerced followers actively volunteered to hand over weapons and repent, and universally demanded to perform meritorious service to atone for their crimes and remove the bandit label, requesting to assist the People's Liberation Army in capturing the bandit leaders who had not yet surrendered. Some requested to join the army to seek revenge, while others were determined to return home to mobilize hidden bandits to repent and register.

Following this, anti-bandit work groups were formed, using the active repentant individuals from the training as the backbone, and considering factors such as region and level of influence. A "Meritorious Service, Atonement, Remove Bandit Hat" campaign was launched. They were assigned to areas where they could be effective and participated in the suppression of bandits alongside the People's Liberation Army bandit suppression units. Of the 83 people who requested to join the army, 23 were approved, while the rest were instructed to perform meritorious service first before joining the army, thus alleviating the concerns of some who feared being forced into the military after training. The ringleaders who were exposed were handed over to the local People's Government for separate handling based on the severity of their crimes.

　　华东九月份剿匪战绩
  　歼土匪近万
  　桐柏山区获改造土匪经验
    【新华社南京五日电】人民解放军华东军区司令部公布九月份剿匪战绩称：全月各野战军与地方武装在剿匪作战中，共消灭国民党土匪特务武装九五九一名，其中俘匪五二零二名，投诚者三五七四名，内校级以上匪官五十八名，毙伤匪八一五名，内击毙匪“反共救国军浙江纵队司令”徐振东等匪首七名。缴获六零炮十一门，迫击炮及小炮三门，掷弹筒二十门，枪榴弹十三门，轻重机关枪一六三挺，冲锋枪六十八支，汤姆及卡宾枪五十一支，长短枪六二八六支，其他弹药物资一部。
    【新华社开封五日电】人民解放军某部在桐柏山区剿匪时，采取集训的方式改造已被捕获及登记悔过的土匪，获得初步经验。该部集训土匪第三期中，参加集训的三百二十人。受训开始时，匪众中有几种不同的思想顾虑。匪首罪大的怕处死；胁从分子怕当兵；家庭缺乏劳动力的怕受训时间太长。
    训练开始时首先进行人民解放军对匪伪人员的“首恶必办，胁从不问，立功者奖”的政策教育，解除大部分人的思想顾虑，初步稳定了情绪。政策教育实施后进行时事教育，说明人民解放军的强大和全国解放战争的胜利形势，揭破土匪特务的谣言，并初步发现胁从匪众中的较积极者。接着进行诉说受穷和被迫当匪的痛苦。在诉苦的基础上，进行争取改造胁从分子，孤立首恶分子，使首恶与胁从分开。结果检举出大小匪首和特务分子六十二人，将这六十二人成立“军管排”，实行管制。之后再发动胁从匪众进行控诉，结合审讯工作，发现了匪大队长陈某、中队长王某等罪大恶极的特务组织的领导人。
    继之即以此为对象，展开了对匪首的斗争。胁从匪众提出陈匪不少罪恶事实后，陈匪还不坦白，多方抵赖，匪众听后极为愤怒。胁从分子王金成马上说：“你不愿当大队长，王××匪南逃时，你回来干什么？你叫我干土匪，若不干就杀我全家。”悔过分子莫某说：“你说黄莲树一家通八路，大小七口人，叫我去挖一个坑都埋了。我不去，你用枪逼，一岁多的小孩也要活埋在一坑。你说这事真不真？”这样经胁从分子对匪首的控诉斗争，揭露陈匪一人杀死六十三条人命，强奸妇女一百五十余人，并唆使匪徒“投降不缴枪，悔过不坦白”，向解放军进行假投降、假自首、假登记等罪行。最后经过这种斗争和结合对陈匪的审讯，查出陈匪就是当地特务组织的负责人，共有四个指挥部，二十个小组。解放军根据所得线索终将其全部破获，缴获机枪二挺，小炮一门，步枪六十支。
    大多数胁从分子经此斗争教育后都纷纷自动献枪悔过，并普遍要求立功赎罪，摘掉土匪帽子；要求协助解放军捉拿尚未就范的匪首。有的则要求参军报仇，还有更多的人决心回家动员隐藏土匪悔过登记。
    此后即以整训时的悔过积极分子为骨干，再以地区、作用大小等条件编写剿匪工作组，展开“立功、赎罪、摘匪帽”运动，分配到能起作用的地区，与解放军剿匪部队一起，参加清剿土匪工作。要求参军的八十三人中，批准了二十三人，其余均令其先立功后参军，这样免去某些人中怕受训后参军的顾虑。检举出来的首恶分子则依情节轻重送地方人民政府分别处理。
