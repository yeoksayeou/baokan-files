Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 4th—The Hubei Province convened a provincial water conservancy conference at the end of last month to discuss and arrange this year's annual repairs, and adopted the "Implementation Measures for Annual Repair and Protection Projects" and "Flood Control Burden Measures" and other regulations. The Hubei Provincial People's Government has decided to allocate 20 million catties of rice as the cost of this year's annual repair projects, and will merge the received old water conservancy organizations to establish a Water Conservancy Bureau to unify leadership and strengthen water control work to prevent floods next year. The conference called on the participating cadres to regard ensuring the approximately 1,800-kilometer-long Jianghan main dike in the province as a glorious and arduous political task to be completed. The meeting also discussed farmland water conservancy, dike construction, mobilizing the masses to implement reasonable burdens, and improving and strengthening leadership.
