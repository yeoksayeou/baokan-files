　　The Northwest Bureau of the CPC Drafts Exam Questions
  　To Test Senior Cadres' Learning
    Summarizing Personal Policy Thoughts from a Historical Materialist Perspective
    [Our Newspaper's Report] In order to inspect the learning effect, the Northwest Bureau of the CPC recently issued a notice regarding the year-end examination for senior cadres. The notice proposed three essay questions: (1) What are the gains from reading the History of Social Development (or Political Economy)? (2) Try to examine personal policy thoughts from the perspective of historical materialism. (3) A report on my understanding and implementation of learning theory. It is stipulated that all senior cadres with higher cultural levels and more experience in the military, government, Party, and civil systems of the border areas, the provincial committees of Gansu, Qinghai, and Ningxia, the district committees of northern Shaanxi and southern Shaanxi, the Xi'an Municipal Committee, and the six directly affiliated prefectural committees of Guanzhong should participate in this examination and choose one question to answer. However, to facilitate grading, only the standing committee members and propaganda ministers of the Gansu, Qinghai, and Ningxia provincial committees, the northern Shaanxi and southern Shaanxi district committees, and the Xi'an Municipal Committee, the main responsible persons of cadre schools and newspapers, the standing committee members and propaganda ministers of the six directly affiliated prefectural committees of Guanzhong, those above the level of minister in the military region, those above the level of director in the border government, and the main responsible comrades of the Party and civil systems are required to submit their exam papers to the Northwest Bureau's General Study Committee after being reviewed by the local Party committee, study committee, or senior cadre study group, along with their grading opinions. The exam papers of other comrades participating in the examination will be reviewed and announced by the local Party committee, study committee, or study group, and then concluded. Except for a few of the best answers, the general ones will not be sent to the General Study Committee. At the same time, all good answers will be sent to the Party newspapers, Party journals, and "People's Northwest" for publication. Those who fail to submit their answers without reason will also be announced in the Party journals or Party newspapers. Finally, the notice stipulates that all answers designated to be submitted to the Northwest Bureau for review must be delivered before December 5th; the answers reviewed by the local Party committees must also be completed by mid-December; and the results of the examination will be submitted to the General Study Committee at the end of December as part of the year-end learning summary.
