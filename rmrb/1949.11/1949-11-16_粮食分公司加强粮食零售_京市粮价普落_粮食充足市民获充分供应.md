The Grain Branch Strengthens Grain Retail Sales
　　Beijing Grain Prices Generally Fall
　　Sufficient Grain Supply Ensures Citizens' Needs are Fully Met

[Report from this newspaper] The Beijing Grain Branch, in collaboration with street cooperatives under the leadership of the Municipal Cooperative Headquarters, has vigorously strengthened grain retail sales, playing a significant role in stabilizing market prices and ensuring sufficient grain supply for citizens. During the recent price fluctuations in the city, many private merchants engaged in price gouging, with some even refusing to sell grain, which affected the lives of ordinary citizens. To safeguard the livelihoods of the general public, the Grain Branch decided to strengthen retail efforts. The existing twelve business locations and twenty-three retail outlets were rapidly restaffed, and from November 11th, full-scale grain retail sales (including millet, millet flour, corn flour, wheat flour, etc.) were initiated. From November 11th to 13th, a total of 687,670 jin of grain were sold. By the 14th, the 29 street consumer cooperative grain sales agencies also commenced retail sales, operating by issuing grain coupons first, followed by grain purchases according to the coupons. The Sixth District Police Station first recorded the householder, population, and occupation on the masses' small booklets, affixed the police station seal, and then directed them to the street cooperative sales agencies to make purchases. Party and government organs in various districts also cooperated in this effort. The Fifth District even mobilized all cadres to assist in sales at various cooperatives. Cadres dispatched by the Municipal Cooperative Headquarters were responsible for guiding business procedures or maintaining order. The 12th and 13th saw the peak of price increases, with widespread panic buying and crowding. However, by the afternoon of the 14th, the situation had calmed down considerably. On the 14th, grain prices generally fell by 50 yuan per jin compared to the 13th. The market price of yellow millet on the 14th was approximately 700 to 750 yuan, while the price at cooperative sales agencies was 500 yuan; high-quality grain was 700 yuan from private merchants and 330 yuan from cooperatives; corn flour was 600 yuan from private merchants and 250 yuan from cooperatives. Statistics for the 14th showed that 28 sales agencies (excluding the Clothing General Factory Cooperative) sold a total of over 60,000 jin of various grains, playing a significant role in stabilizing public sentiment and curbing grain prices, and receiving warm support from the masses. Some citizens even volunteered to help cooperatives find larger premises, enabling the smooth development of cooperative business.

　　粮食分公司加强粮食零售
  　京市粮价普落
  　粮食充足市民获充分供应
    【本报迅】京市粮食分公司与市合作总社领导下的各街合作社合力加强粮食零售，充分供应市民需粮，在稳定市场物价中起了极大作用。此次本市物价波动中，不少私商哄抬物价，有的甚至拒售食粮，使一般市民生活受到影响。粮食分公司为保证广大市民生活，决定加强零售工作，将现有十二个营业处与二十三个零售店的业务人员迅速重新配备，自十一日起，全力进行食粮零售（包括小米、小米面、玉米面、面粉等），从十一日至十三日已售出粮食六十八万七千六百七十斤。到十四日二十九个街道消费合作社食粮代销部亦均开业零售，经营办法是先发售粮号头，然后按号购粮。第六区派出所是先在群众的小折子上写明户主、人口、职业，加盖派出所图章，然后介绍到各街社代销部去买。各区党政机关也都配合了这一工作。五区并动员全体干部分工到各社帮助出售；市总社派的干部则负责指导业务手续或维持秩序。十二三日为物价之最高峰，各处抢购挤购现象很多，但到十四日下午就很平静了。十四日粮价，比十三日每斤普落五十元。十四日黄小米的市价约七百至七百五十元，而各合作社代销部售价则为五百元；高粮米私商七百元，合作社三百三十元，玉米面私商六百元，合作社二百五十元。十四日一天统计，由二十八个（缺被服总厂合作社）代销部共售出各种食粮达六万多斤，对安定人心平抑粮价起了重大作用。受到群众热烈拥护。有的市民并自动帮助合作社找大房子，使合作社业务得以顺利发展。
