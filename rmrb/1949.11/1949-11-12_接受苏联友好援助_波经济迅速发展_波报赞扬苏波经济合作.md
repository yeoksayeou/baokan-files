Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 11th: The Polish Press Agency in Warsaw reports that the Polish-Soviet Weekly recently published an article entitled "Soviet-Polish Economic Cooperation," stating that the economic cooperation between the Soviet Union and Poland illustrates a new type of relationship between nations. Before the war, the trade relations between Poland and the Soviet Union were insignificant. In 1924, Soviet exports to Poland were valued at 5 million zlotys (Polish currency), doubling by 1938, but Polish exports to the Soviet Union decreased from 11 million zlotys in 1924 to 1.4 million zlotys in 1938. Before the war, some members of the Polish government deliberately refused to maintain proper business relations with the Soviet Union, which was against Poland's own interests.

	In the first five months of 1945, Polish-Soviet trade jumped to 350 million gold zlotys. In that year, Poland received everything indispensable for reconstruction, such as seeds, grains, tractors, automobiles, petroleum, flax, iron ore, cellulose, and paper. At the same time, Poland supplied the Soviet Union with coal and coking coal worth 217 million zlotys, textiles worth 39 million zlotys, steel products worth 19 million zlotys, and shoes, chemicals, non-ferrous metals, and finished products worth a total of 35.4 million zlotys. In that year, raw materials and semi-finished products accounted for 73 percent of Polish exports to the Soviet Union, and finished products accounted for 27 percent.

	In 1945 and 1946, when the young People's Democratic Poland was entering the international arena, the Soviet Union occupied a particularly important position in Poland's foreign trade. At the same time, Soviet-Polish economic cooperation also helped the development of Poland's economic relations with other countries. By the end of 1946, Poland had traded with Sweden, Denmark, the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany, France, Czechoslovakia, Switzerland, and Norway. In 1947, it further traded with twenty-six countries.

	According to the treaty concluded with the Soviet Union in March 1947, Poland obtained its first post-war gold loan of more than 28 million US dollars. The Polish-Soviet trade agreement in August 1947 enabled Poland to obtain 300,000 tons of grain urgently needed due to crop failures and the termination of aid from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. The Polish-Soviet treaty concluded in January 1948, covering the period from 1948 to 1952, stipulated a barter arrangement worth 1 billion US dollars. The Soviet Union supplied Poland with ore, petroleum products, cotton, and automobiles, while Poland supplied the Soviet Union with coal, coking coal, textiles, sugar, zinc, steel products, and railroad cars. Another treaty specifically stipulated that the Soviet Union would provide Poland with industrial equipment worth 450 million US dollars in credit loans. At the same time, the Soviet Union additionally lent Poland 200,000 tons of grain. In this way, the grain supplied by the Soviet Union to Poland increased to 500,000 tons.

	In 1949, Polish-Soviet trade exceeded the provisions of the 1948 treaty. The exchange of technical information between the two countries played a decisive role in Poland's reconstruction. Thanks to the friendly assistance of the Soviet Union, Poland had exceeded its pre-war industrial production level by 1947. Cooperation with fraternal countries has promoted Poland's industrialization and created the possibility of rapidly increasing Poland's national income. In this way, it directly contributes to the completion of the reconstruction plan and the strengthening of Poland's defense forces, and accelerates Poland's advance towards socialism.

### 接受苏联友好援助  波经济迅速发展  波报赞扬苏波经济合作

    接受苏联友好援助
    波经济迅速发展
    波报赞扬苏波经济合作
    【新华社北京十一日电】波兰通讯社华沙讯：波兰苏波周报最近刊载“波苏经济合作”一文称：苏联与波兰之间的经济合作，向人们说明了国家与国家之间的一种新关系。在战前，波苏之间的贸易关系是不足称道的。一九二四年，苏联对波兰的输出值五百万兹罗提（波币），一九三八年增加一倍，但波兰对苏联的输出却从一九二四年的一千一百万兹罗提降至一九三八年的一百四十万兹罗提。战前，波兰政府的部分人员蓄意拒绝对苏维持正当的商务关系，这是违反波兰的切身利益的。
    一九四五年头五个月中，波苏贸易一跃而达三亿五千万金兹罗提。那一年中，波兰得到了重建工作中不可或缺的一切东西，如种子、谷物、拖拉机、汽车、石油、亚麻、铁矿苗、纤维素与纸张等。同时波兰也供给苏联价值二亿一千七百万兹罗提的煤和焦煤，三千九百万兹罗提的纺织物、一千九百万兹罗提的钢制品，以及共值三千五百四十万兹罗提的鞋、化学品、非铁金属与制成品。那一年，原料与半制品占波兰对苏输出的百分之七十三，制成品占百分之二十七。
    在一九四五年和一九四六年，当年轻的人民民主波兰正在踏进国际舞台之时，苏联在波兰的对外贸易中占特别重要的地位。同时，波苏的经济合作，也帮助了波兰与其它各国的经济关系的发展。至一九四六年底，波兰便与瑞典、丹麦、德境苏占区、法国、捷克、瑞士及挪威进行贸易，在一九四七年一年中，更进而与二十六个国家进行贸易了。
    波兰根据一九四七年三月与苏联缔结的条约，获得了战后第一次的黄金贷款二千八百多万美元。一九四七年八月的波苏商约，使波兰获得因歉收与联合国救济总署中止援助而迫切需要的三十万吨谷物。一九四八年一月缔结的、以一九四八年至一九五二年为期的波苏条约，规定了价值十亿美元的换货办法，苏联给波兰以矿苗、石油产物、棉花和汽车等，波兰则以煤、焦煤、纺织物、糖、锌、钢制品与车箱供给苏联。另一个条约特别规定苏联以信用贷款方式供给波兰价值四亿五千万美元的工业装备，同时，苏联额外贷给波兰二十万吨谷物。这样，苏联供给波兰的谷物便增至五十万吨。
    在一九四九年，波苏贸易超过一九四八年条约的规定。两国之间的技术情报之交换，对波兰的重建起了决定性的作用。由于苏联友好的援助，波兰至一九四七年便已超过了战前的工业生产水平。与各兄弟国家的合作，促进了波兰的工业化，并创造了迅速增加波兰国民收入的可能性。这样，它就直接有助于重建计划的完成与波兰自卫力量的增强，并且加速了波兰向社会主义的迈进。
