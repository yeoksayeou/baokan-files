　　Guide of Commander-in-Chief Zhu
    Ma Hanbing
    Not long after the liberation of Linxia, an elderly Tibetan man named Jialuo and six other Tibetan compatriots entered our camp and asked bluntly:
    "Has Commander-in-Chief Zhu arrived? We traveled over two hundred miles specifically to see him." When we told him that Commander-in-Chief Zhu was commanding the national people's liberation war and that we were his troops, the old man repeatedly made a gesture of respect with both hands.
    "Good! Good! Commander-in-Chief Zhu's troops are just like him."
    We warmly welcomed the guests with specially prepared buttered tea and red tea. The old man sat down, took a sip, and then peacefully began to talk about events from fourteen years ago. The old man counted his fingers and said, "Oh, it's been fifteen years! Back in the twenty-fourth year of the Republic of China, on the twenty-third day of the eighth lunar month, Commander-in-Chief Zhu led his troops to the Liaoke Grassland (south of Minxian); at that time, the Red Army had difficulties with food and no houses to live in, but they were the most disciplined, not taking a single needle or thread from the people. We gave our food to the Red Army, and they lived with us, as close as a family." The old man continued to narrate, "In these long years, the people of the grassland have never forgotten the Red Army, nor have they forgotten Commander-in-Chief Zhu. The elderly often tell their children and grandchildren stories about the Red Army." The old man perked up and said, "When the Red Army left, Yang Buyun (the Chief of the Five Banners of Mowo) sent two Tibetans and one Han Chinese to guide our Red Army. I was one of the two Tibetans. When I entered the Red Army's camp, a comrade wearing a worn-out military uniform invited me to stay with him, kindly asking how many people were in my family and how we were doing. I stayed with him for three days, leading our troops to a place called Anggela. When we were about to part, he told me that he was Commander-in-Chief Zhu. This shocked me. He also gave me a photograph, a set of satin clothing material, Sichuan red tea, leaflets, etc., and told me, 'The Red Army will definitely return!'" Now you have really returned. Men and women in the Xiahe Zhuoni area have long prepared butter, zanba (a kind of Tibetan food), and military shoes to welcome you, because you are the protectors of the Tibetans, the saviors of the Tibetans!" Although the old man had traveled for a day, he forgot his fatigue and continued to accuse the Kuomintang reactionaries and the Ma bandits of the disasters they had inflicted on them: "Since the Red Army left, the Tibetans on the grassland have suffered under the oppression of the Jiang bandits, Ma bandits, and Tibetan traitors, living a life worse than that of cattle and horses. In the most recent instance alone, they forcibly demanded five hundred Tibetan horses and more than forty thousand silver dollars. Many Tibetans in the Mowo mountainous area are simply on the verge of starvation…"
    Fourteen years later, when he saw Commander-in-Chief Zhu's troops again, the old man said to Commander Wang Zhen with tears in his eyes, "Commander! Please keep the suffering of the Tibetans firmly in your heart and rescue us from this fiery pit as soon as possible. I am seventy-seven years old this year, but today I have met the revolutionary troops again. Now, even if I die, I can close my eyes in peace."

　　朱总司令的向导
    马寒冰
    临夏解放不久，一位叫嘉罗的藏族老人和六位藏胞，走进了我们的营房，劈头就问：
    “朱总司令来了吗？我们特别跑了二百多里路来看他老人家的。”当我们告诉他朱总司令正在指挥全国人民解放战争，我们就是他的队伍以后，老人频频以两手作礼。
    “好！好！朱总司令的队伍，也就和他本人一样。”
    我们用特备的酥酒红茶，热情地招待来客，老人坐下来，呷了一口，马上安祥地谈起十四年前的往事。老人数着手指说：“噢，十五个年头啦！远在民国二十四年的旧历八月二十三日，朱总司令带着人马，来到咱辽克草原（岷县以南）；那时的红军粮食困难，没有房子住，但是却最讲规矩，不拿人民一针一线，我们把食品送给咱们红军吃，他们和我们生活在一起，象一家人一样的亲热。”老人接着叙述：“在这些悠长的岁月里，草原上的人们一直没有忘记了红军，也没有忘记了朱总司令，老年人经常给自己的儿孙讲着红军的故事。”老人振了一下精神说：“红军走时，杨步云（陌务五旗总土司）派了两个藏人和一个汉人给咱红军带路，我就是两个藏人中间的一个。当我走进了红军的营房，有一位身穿破旧军服的同志，招呼我和他住在一起，亲热的问我家有几个人？过的好不好？我和他住了三天，一直把咱的队伍带到一个名叫安哥拉的地方，临走的时候他才告诉我他就是朱总司令。这才把我吃了一惊，他还送我一张照片，一套缎子衣料，和四川红茶、传单等，并且告诉我：“红军一定会回来的！”现在你们真的回来了。我们夏河卓尼一带的男女，早已准备好酥油、粘巴（藏民食品之一种）、军鞋来欢迎你们，因为你们是藏民的保护人，藏民的救星！”老人虽然赶了一天路，却忘记疲乏，继续向自己的队伍控诉国民党反动派和马匪加于他们的灾害：“自从红军走后，草原上的藏民受着蒋贼、马匪和藏奸的压迫，过着牛马不如的生活，光是最近一次就强要五百匹藏马，四万多块银元，陌务山区的许多藏胞，简直快困死了……”
    十四年以后，当他重又见到朱总司令指挥的队伍的时候，老人激动的流着泪对王震司令员说：“司令员！藏民的苦难，请牢牢记在心头，早日来搭救我们跳出火炕。我今年七十七岁，但是今天又和革命队伍会面了，我现在就是死了，也可以瞑目了。”
