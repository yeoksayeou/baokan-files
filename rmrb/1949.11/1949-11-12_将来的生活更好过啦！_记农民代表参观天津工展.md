    "Life Will Be Better in the Future!"
    A Record of Farmer Representatives Visiting the Tianjin Industrial Exhibition
    Zheng Jia
    Groups of farmer representatives walked into the gates of the Industrial Exhibition.
    Farmer representatives from the Tongzhou, Tangshan, Tianjin, Dingxian, and Shijiazhuang regions formed a team and first visited the Third Hall.
    The Third Hall was the Export Goods Hall. As soon as they entered the exhibition hall, they saw various patterned carpets hanging. A female worker was demonstrating how to embroider raised-pattern carpets, while another worker explained to the farmer representatives: the raw material for carpets is wool, and in addition to the wool sheared from sheep, things like broken felt hat shells, broken felt pieces, and old woolen clothes can also be spun into yarn. The farmer representatives laughed as they listened, recalling the broken felt hats they had worn, which they had used to line the soles of children's shoes because they were useless. Some people said, "If we had known this earlier, we could have collected them and sent them to Tianjin to be woven into such beautiful carpets, which could be sold abroad in exchange for the machines we need most. That would be killing two birds with one stone!" Some people were so happy that they unconsciously violated the "Do Not Touch" rule, reaching out to feel the fluffy, beautifully woven, and thick carpets, praising them repeatedly.
    In the area displaying native products, the most familiar items to the farmers were peanuts, walnuts, and red dates. Although they looked familiar, they seemed to be wearing new clothes, appearing particularly radiant. Take peanuts, for example: the kernels were large, the skin was red, and they were plump and oily. Thirty-six such peanuts could yield one tael of peanut oil. It turned out that these peanuts were specially selected, and their export price was much higher than that of ordinary peanuts. The farmers said, "We must be careful to select seeds this time. These goods look pleasing!" A farmer from Xinji specifically inquired about the yield of cottonseed oil. The person in charge of explaining told him that one hundred jin of cottonseed could produce ten jin of oil. He was extremely happy and told others, "Our area is particularly good at producing cotton. The cotton is used by our factories to spin yarn and weave cloth, and the cottonseed is used by our factories to extract oil for export. The people are so happy!"
    There were many kinds of straw braid on display, including the usual four- and five-strand braids, as well as so-called "Three Dragon Fan Faces, Five Dragon Fan Faces, Two-Pull Centipedes, Three-Pull Centipedes, Four-Pull Centipedes," etc., woven like lace. In addition, there was a kind called "Split Straw Flat Braid," which was woven from split wheat stalks, and the four strands were only four fen wide, woven with great precision. The products from Yexian in Shandong and Xinji in Hebei were the most famous. An employee of the North China Native Products Company told the farmers, "These large flower braids are sold individually. Foreigners use them like lace to decorate things like handbags, and they cost five U.S. dollars apiece." A farmer representative from Xinji said, "These split straw braids are all woven by girls who are seventeen or eighteen years old. First, they are focused, and second, their eyesight is good. Older people can't weave them so well. Five U.S. dollars is worth it. In the future, we must not let foreigners take advantage of the things that the Chinese people work so hard to make!"
    When the farmers saw the down and feather displays, everyone laughed and said, "As the saying goes, 'Chicken feathers and garlic skins are of little use,' but now chicken feathers and duck feathers are also useful. In the future, we must tell everyone that when they slaughter chickens and ducks, they should collect the feathers." When they saw the twelve-inch-long bristles, everyone was surprised and inquired about what kind of pigs they came from. After seeing the special handicrafts from Beijing, they praised the exquisite craftsmanship.
    Leaving the Third Hall, they entered the Fourth Hall, which was the Steel and Machinery Hall.
    The Tianjin Steel Plant of the North China Iron and Steel Company displayed an oil painting of the operation and steel tapping of an open-hearth furnace. Some farmer representatives, after listening to the explanation, said, "The steelworkers work next to the hot furnace all day long. If they are not careful, a drop of steel will fall on them and burn a big blister. The worker brothers are just like us farmers, and their work is very hard." A farmer cadre said, "Hardship is hardship, but this work is the most important. It's like the skeleton of a person. Steel is the skeleton of various machines. Without steel, there would be no machines, and without machines, there would be no industrial production!" Nail-making machines, screw-making machines, and needle-making machines were all demonstrated on the spot by the workers. The farmers were most interested in the various machines that were closely related to their lives. For example, they paid close attention to the oil press, inquiring about the method of use and the price. In particular, a cadre from a village cooperative inquired the most carefully. A women farmer representative from Zhengding inquired about the use of the wheat grinding machine. When she heard that this machine could grind 18,000 jin of wheat in 24 hours, she said with particular joy, "When the day comes when every village has such a machine, women will no longer have to push the millstone day and night. That will also be a great liberation!" The new-style iron plow pulled by a donkey could plow as deep as eight inches and could plow fifteen or sixteen mu a day. Each plow was priced at three hundred and twenty jin of rice. A farmer representative from Zhengding County said, "Next year, we must plant more cotton and buy such an iron plow." He also requested that the price not be calculated in rice, but in cotton. The farmers asked very carefully about the wheel plow, cultivator, weeder, and seeder produced by the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory in Beijing. A worker from the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory who was responsible for explaining spoke to them kindly: "This year, the rain was heavy, and our farmers are having difficulties. If one family cannot afford these machines, everyone can buy shares together, and the People's Government can also provide loans." The farmer representatives also replied to the worker kindly, "That's right, it's good to organize!"
    A worker responsible for explaining sat on the seat of the harvester and demonstrated how to use the machine to the farmers. Next to the tractor that everyone had heard about for a long time, there was also a circle of people asking about the price, the method of use, and the situation of farmers in the Soviet Union. Next to the many machines displayed by the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory, the farmers looked reluctantly for a long time, looking and asking. An old farmer with a long beard from Tongxian said, "I wouldn't get tired of looking at them for ten days. I think these things will definitely be popular in the future."
    An old farmer representative from Shulu County, while visiting the aluminum pot, forgot the "Do Not Touch" rule, picked up the pot and weighed it. The pot was really light, fire-saving, strong, and cheap. He decided to buy a pot with a steamer. He said, "The harvest in Shulu County is not bad this year, so let's improve our lives a bit! Produce well during the New Year and have another good harvest, and we can also buy some machines."
    At this time, farmer representatives from the old liberated areas of Pingshan and Jingxing were discussing: "These machines, the smaller ones can still be used in our mountain gullies, but the larger ones cannot. These things will be very useful in the future when collective farms are established on the great plains of central Hebei! In our mountains, we should develop more fruit trees, mountain products, and medicinal materials, which can also be done collectively!..."
    By the time they finished visiting the Fourth Hall, the farmer representatives were quite tired. The child held by the female representative from Zhengding had already been helped up by a male representative. The old farmer with the long beard from Tongxian took out his small pipe, intending to smoke a bag of tobacco to relieve his fatigue. A farmer representative next to him immediately reminded him, "Old man, you forgot again, aren't you not allowed to smoke?" The old man put the pipe back into the front of his cotton robe, stroked his beard, and said with a smile, "Our life will be better in the future, young men, work hard on production!"

    “将来的生活更好过啦！”
    记农民代表参观天津工展
    郑佳
    农民代表们成群结队的走进了工展会的大门。
    通州、唐山、天津、定县、石家庄各个专区的农民代表们，组成了一支队伍，首先参观第三馆。
    第三馆是出口物资馆。刚一进展览馆，就看见挂着的各式花纹的地毯。一位女工，正在表演刺凸凹花的地毯，这时候，另一位工友就向农民代表解释：地毯的原料是羊毛，除了从羊身上剪下来的羊毛以外，象破毡帽壳呀，破毡片子呀，旧呢子衣裳呀，也都可以用来再纺成毛线。农民代表们听着笑了，他们想起了戴过的破毡帽，因为没有用处，都给小孩子垫了鞋底；有的人说：“早知道这个事就好了，以后咱们可以搜集起来，送到天津织成这样漂亮的地毯，运到外国去卖，还可以换回咱们最需要的机器，真是一举两得的事情。”有些人高兴得不知不觉的违反了“不许动手”的禁令，伸手去摸了摸那绒忽忽织得又好看、又厚实的地毯，并且连声赞美。
    在山货陈列的地方，摆着农民最熟悉的花生、核桃、红枣这些东西，看起来虽然很熟悉，可是又好象都穿上了新衣服一样，显得特别光采。拿花生来说吧，颗子大，皮红，肥溜溜的，三十六颗这样的花生就可以榨出一两花生油来。原来这种花生是特别挑出来的，这种花生就出口价要比普通的花生贵得多。农民们说：“这回可要留神选种啦，这种货色，看着也叫人喜欢呀！”一位辛集的农民，特别打听了棉籽油的产量，负责解释的人告诉他，一百斤棉籽可以出十斤油。他高兴极了，告诉别人说：“咱们那一带特别出棉花，棉花给咱们工厂纺纱织布，棉籽再给咱们的工厂来榨油出口，老百姓可乐啦！”
    陈列的草帽辫种类很多，除了普通四、五股编法的以外，还有所谓“三龙扇面、五龙扇面，二拉蜈蚣、三拉蜈蚣、四拉蜈蚣”等等花样，编得象花边一样。此外，还有一种叫“劈草平面细辫”，是把麦杆劈开编的，四股只有四分宽，编得真是十分精细。以山东掖县和河北辛集的出品最有名。华北土产公司的职员告诉农民说：“这种大花辫，是一根一根卖的，外国人拿它当花边一样用，装饰在手提包一类的东西上，要五块美金一根哪。”辛集的农民代表说：“象这种劈草细辫，都是十七八岁的小姑娘们编的，第一，她们心专，第二，她们眼好；年纪再大就编不了这么好啦。五块美金，也值，以后咱们中国人辛辛苦苦做的东西可不能再让外国人讨便宜了！”
    农民们看到绒羽陈列品的时候，大家都笑着说：“俗话说，‘鸡毛蒜皮，顶不了大用，’这会鸡毛鸭毛也有了用处啦，以后可要告诉大伙，宰了鸡鸭，就把毛毛羽羽收拾起来。”看到十二英寸长的猪鬃，大家都很惊异的打听那是什么种猪，看了北京的特种手工艺品，对于制作的精细赞美不已。
    出第三馆，进了第四馆，这是钢铁机械馆。
    华北钢铁公司天津炼钢厂，陈列了一副马丁炉操作和出钢情形的油画，有的农民代表听过解释以后，这样说：“炼钢的工人整天在热火炉子旁边工作，一不留神，落到身上一滴钢，还不得烧个大燎泡。工人弟兄和咱们农民一样，工作是顶幸苦的。”一位农民干部说：“辛苦是辛苦，这工作可最要紧，就好比人的骨架，钢就是各种机器的骨架，没有钢，也就没有机器，也就没有工业生产啦！”制钉机、制螺丝钉机和制针机等都由工人们当场表演了生产过程。农民们最感兴趣的是和他们生活有着密切关系的各种机械，象对榨油机，他们就很注意的打听使用的方法和价钱，特别是一位村合作社的干部打听的最仔细。正定的妇女农民代表打听着磨麦机的用法，当她听到这种机器在二十四小时里面可以磨一万八千斤麦子的时候，特别高兴的说：“等将来每个村子有这么一架机器的那一天，妇女们就不用整天整夜的推碾倒磨的了，那也是一大解放啊！”驴拉的新式铁犁最深能耕八寸，一天可以耕十五六亩，每架价格是三百二十斤大米。正定县的一位农民代表说：“明年一定要多种点棉花，买这么一架铁犁。”并且要求不要照大米折价，要照棉花折价才好。农民们对于北京华北农业机械总厂出产的带轮犁、中耕器、除草机、播种机等都问得很仔细；华北农业机械总厂负责解释的一位工友亲切的和他们谈着：“今年雨水潦了，咱们农民很困难，一家子买不起这些机器，大家可以合股来买，人民政府还可以贷款。”农民代表们也亲切地回答这位工友说：“就是啦，要组织起来就好啦！”
    一位负责解释的工友，坐在收割机的座位上，给农民们表演这种机器的用法。在大家早就听说过的拖拉机的旁边，也围了一圈人在问价格，问用法，问苏联的农民情形。在华北农业机械总厂所陈列的许多机器旁边，农民们恋恋不舍的看了半天，一面看，一面问。通县一位胡子很长的老农说：“看十天也看不厌，我看这些玩艺将来非时兴开不可。”
    束鹿县一位老农民代表，参观到铝锅的旁边，忘记了“不许动手”的禁令，拿起锅来掂了掂分量，锅子真是轻便，又省火，又结实，又便宜，他决定要买一个带蒸笼的锅。他说：“今年束鹿县的年景不坏，也来改善一下生活吧！过年好好生产，再闹个丰收，还可以买些机器。”
    这时候，平山、井陉等老解放区农民代表正谈论着：“这些机器，小点的在咱们那山沟里还能用上，大点的就不能用啦。这些东西将来在冀中大平原上搞起集体农场来作用可大呀！在咱们山里头还是多发展果木树、山货、药材，那也可以集体合作呀！……”
    参观完第四馆的时候，农民代表们已经相当累了，那位正定女代表抱着的小孩，已经由一位男代表帮忙抱起来了。通县那位长胡子的老农民，掏出了小烟袋，打算抽袋烟解解乏，旁边的一位农民代表立刻提醒他说：“你老人家又忘了，不是不让抽烟吗？”老头子一面把烟袋放回棉袍大襟去，一面摸着胡子笑着说：“将来咱们生活更好过啦，小伙子们，好好闹生产吧！”
