　　Swiftly Implement Resolutions of People's Representatives Conference
    Beijing Municipal Government Closes All Brothels
　　Over a Thousand Prostitutes Freed from Torture and Exploitation
    [Beijing News] All 196 brothels in Beijing were closed down at 8 PM last night. The remnants of the barbaric system that has tormented women for thousands of years have been eradicated forever from the people's capital. This is the result of the Municipal Government's swift implementation of the resolutions of the Second All-Circles People's Representatives Conference.
    Yesterday afternoon at 5 PM, the All-Circles People's Representatives Conference unanimously passed the resolution to close brothels. Mayor Nie Rongzhen solemnly announced amid enthusiastic applause that this resolution would be implemented immediately. Upon receiving the order, the Municipal Public Security Bureau dispatched over 2,400 cadres and members of the Public Security Corps at 5:30 PM. Under the guidance of the General Command Headquarters, the Civil Affairs Bureau, the Municipal Women's Federation, and other relevant departments assisted in taking in over 1,200 prostitutes who had suffered torture and exploitation from the five districts of the outer city, as well as the eastern and western suburbs, and placing them in temporary women's production and education centers. At the same time, 196 brothel owners, pimps, and others, totaling 385 people, who relied on exploiting prostitutes for a living and were extremely barbaric and ruthless, were gathered for investigation and will be dealt with according to law based on the severity of their crimes. All brothel property was confiscated and used to provide relief to the prostitutes. The prostitutes generally reacted well during the roundup. Yu Shu, a third-class prostitute, said, "This is wonderful, we have been looking forward to this day for a long time." Liu Guiying's mother, a third-class prostitute, had just come from Taiyuan and was moved to tears when she saw her daughter escape from the pit of fire. She said, "If it weren't for the Kuomintang in Taiyuan grabbing people and demanding money, who would be willing to pawn their own daughter into a 'whorehouse'!" For the few prostitutes who did not understand the policy, the cadres of the Public Security Bureau gave gentle explanations and persuasion. In order to enable the prostitutes to obtain complete liberation, the temporary women's production and rescue homes will, in accordance with the spirit of the resolutions of this Beijing All-Circles Representatives Conference, be responsible for educating the prostitutes, reforming their thinking, treating their venereal diseases, sending those with families home, helping those with marriage prospects to get married, and for those who do not yet have marriage prospects, organizing them to learn skills and engage in production, so that they can gradually become independent and self-sufficient and become a productive force in society.

　　迅速执行各界代表会决议
    京市府封闭全市妓院
　　千余妓女摆脱摧残剥削
    【北京讯】京市一百九十六家妓院，在昨晚八时被全部封闭。几千年来摧残妇女的野蛮制度的残余，从此在人民首都永远绝迹。这是市政府迅速执行第二届各界人民代表会议决议的结果。
    昨日下午五时，各界人民代表会议一致通过封闭妓院的决议，聂荣臻市长在热烈掌声中，郑重宣布，立刻执行此项决议。市公安局于奉到命令之后，在五时半即出动干部和公安总队二千四百余人，在总局总指挥部的指导下，由民政局、市妇联等有关部门予以协助，分别到外城五个区及东郊、西郊等地，将饱受摧残和剥削的一千二百多个妓女，分别收容于临时设立的妇女生产教养院。同时对依靠剥削妓女为生，极端野蛮狠毒的一百九十六家妓院老板、领家等三百八十五人，分别集中审查，将按罪行大小依法处理。妓院财产全部没收，作为救济妓女之用。妓女在收容时，一般反映良好，三等妓女玉淑说：“这真好极了，我们早就盼望这一天。”三等妓女柳桂英的母亲刚从太原来，看到她女儿跳出火炕，感动得哭了，她说：“要不是从前国民党在太原抓人要钱，谁愿意把亲生女儿押到“窑子”里来呢！”对少数不了解政策的妓女，公安局的干部都予以温和的解释说服。为了使妓女们获得彻底的解放，临时设立的妇女生产救养院将依据此次京市各界代表会议决议的精神，负责对妓女进行教育，改造其思想，并将为她们医治性病，有家可归者遣送回家，有结婚对象者助其结婚，还没有结婚对象的，就组织她们学习技能，从事生产，使她们能逐渐独立谋生，成为社会的生产力量。
