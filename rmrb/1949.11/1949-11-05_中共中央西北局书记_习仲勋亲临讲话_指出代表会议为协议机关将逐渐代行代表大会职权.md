　　CCP Central Committee Northwest Bureau Secretary
  　Xi Zhongxun Attends and Speaks
    Pointing out that the Representative Meeting is a Consultative Body and Will Gradually Act on Behalf of the People's Congress
    On the first day of the conference, Xi Zhongxun, Secretary of the CCP Central Committee Northwest Bureau, attended and delivered a speech. He pointed out: This People's Representative Conference of all circles, symbolizing the great unity of the people of Chang'an County, is the result of our people's revolution and will also be the foundation for us to build a new Chang'an County. He continued: The Chang'an County People's Representative Conference of all circles is the consultative body of the Chang'an County People's Government, and it will gradually act on behalf of the Chang'an County People's Congress. People's representatives from all walks of life will jointly discuss the administrative guidelines of Chang'an County at this meeting in order to formulate a common program for building a new Chang'an County, which everyone will abide by together. He said: The basic problem to be discussed and resolved at this meeting is to mobilize the peasant masses to rise up and overthrow the landlords and local bullies. In the newly liberated Chang'an County, local bullies and landlords are still acting like overlords and oppressing the peasants. After Xi Zhongxun's speech, Lu Ming, the county magistrate of Chang'an County, made a report on "The Work of the Chang'an County People's Government in the Past Four Months and the Future Work Guidelines."
    On the second day of the conference, group discussions were held. Peasant representatives from the entire county were divided into eight groups according to the eight central districts, and representatives from other circles were also divided into eight groups. Government representatives participated in each group according to the nature of their work. The sixteen groups conducted thematic discussions based on the nature and characteristics of each group, so that representatives from all walks of life had ample opportunities to speak. For example, the peasant representative groups discussed issues such as disaster relief production, rent reduction and debt clearing, reasonable burden, eliminating bandits and secret agents, and opposing local bullies; the cultural and educational group and the youth group discussed issues related to education work and youth activities.
    On the third day of the conference, a plenary discussion was held, with a total of thirty-two people signing up to make central speeches. In their speeches, the representatives unanimously agreed with County Magistrate Lu Ming's report on "The Work Report of the Past Four Months and Future Work Guidelines." The speeches of several peasant representatives, in particular, won the unanimous sympathy and support of the entire audience. Dong Xingwu, a peasant representative from Wangqu District, used his personal experience of feudal persecution to tell of the peasants' urgent demands in the form of careful accounting. He said: "The past days were really hard. For example, I cultivated the land of the landlord Li Laoer in the village. Each mu of land could produce about one shi and one dou each year, and I had to pay seven dou in rent. His dou was bigger, which was equal to seven dou and seven sheng. The poor suffered the most. After a year of hard work, the income was still not enough to eat. In addition to paying rent, the cost of fertilizer and waterwheels alone would cost three or four dou. If the harvest was bad, we would even lose money. If we owed rent, we would have to go to the mountains to cut firewood and sell it for money to subsidize. But the landlords still said: 'If you don't owe half a year's rent, you won't get a reduction in rent in a famine year.' In famine years, the poor cannot afford to eat or wear clothes. So today I want to propose rent reduction and debt clearing, and hope that everyone will discuss and study a way to let us have something to eat."
    　　　　Peasant Representatives Account for Suffering and Demand Overthrow of Local Bullies and Landlords
    Peasant representatives He Yulin, Yang Chengjia, Zhang Fu, and others also accused the feudal landlords of high rents and usury exploitation based on the actual situation in their villages, and put forward urgent demands for rent and interest reduction. Yang Chengjia firmly said: "I was elected by the peasants. My demand for rent reduction is not a personal opinion, it is the opinion of all the peasants, and this opinion has power. Everyone must unite all the peasants when they go back, so that we can reduce rent, clear debts, and overthrow the local bullies and landlords." Peasant representative Lei Dengying also said: "To oppose feudalism, we must have organization. When the villains saw our township's peasant association, they were afraid. However, our work also had problems in the past. We did not unite the middle peasants well. This time, we must expand the peasant association, unite the middle peasants well, and publicize all the resolutions of this meeting so that everyone can do it." After the peasant representatives spoke, representatives of democratic figures, educators, and enlightened gentry spoke successively. Democratic figure Cheng Xijing said: "In the past, we did not understand the peasants at all. Today, after listening to the words of the peasant representatives, I was very moved. We must unite with the peasants and carry out rural reforms with the peasants." Democratic figure Wang Zuodong said: "After listening to the speeches of several peasant representatives, I realized that the peasants have suffered too much. I also agree with what the representatives asked for." At the meeting that day, army representative Liu Chongying also recounted the fighting and development of the Sixth Detachment of the local armed forces, and gave opinions on future rectification. Worker representative Ai Shengru suggested that the government solve the employment problem of unemployed workers and repair roads and alleys. Women representatives Li Shuzhi and Rong Libi proposed organizing rural working women, striving to participate in labor production and rural political life; gradually promoting and implementing freedom of marriage; establishing midwifery schools, improving rural native midwifery, and developing rural maternal and child health. Youth student representative Hui Weiyu expressed that he would mobilize youth students to go deep into the countryside, understand rural life, and publicize the various policies of the People's Government to the peasants.
    The conference unanimously approved County Magistrate Lu Ming's report on the work of the past four months and future work guidelines, and adopted 64 proposals based on the current actual situation in the county. The meeting also decided to take "organizing peasant associations, establishing rural people's power, implementing rent reduction and clearing old debts, developing production, supporting the front lines, suppressing bandits, eliminating secret agents, and reforming education" as the central tasks at present. The conference adopted the "Organizational Law of the Chang'an County People's Representative Conference" and the "Measures for Rent Reduction and Clearing Old Debts in Chang'an County" submitted by the Farmers' Congress of the county for discussion. On the fourth day of the conference, County Magistrate Lu Ming answered questions and conducted elections. The conference elected 25 people as members of the Standing Committee of the Chang'an County People's Representative Conference. The conference then successfully closed amidst lasting slogans and applause.

　　中共中央西北局书记
  　习仲勋亲临讲话
    指出代表会议为协议机关将逐渐代行代表大会职权
    大会第一日，中共中央西北局书记习仲勋亲临致辞。他指出：这个象征着长安县全县人民大团结的各界人民代表会议，是我们人民革命胜利的结果，也将是我们建设新的长安县的基础。他接着说：长安县各界人民代表会议是长安县人民政府的协议机关，它将逐渐代行长安县人民代表大会的职权。各界人民代表在这次会议上将共同商讨长安县的施政方针，以便制订出一个建设新长安县的共同纲领，大家共同遵守。他说：这次会议所要商量解决的基本问题，就是发动农民群众起来，打倒地主恶霸。在新解放的长安县，恶霸地主还在作威作福，欺压农民。在习仲勋致词后，长安县长鹿鸣作了“四个月来长安县人民政府的工作及今后工作方针”的报告。
    大会第二日进行小组讨论。全县农民代表按八个中心区分为八个小组，其他各界代表亦分为八个小组，机关代表按工作性质分别参加各组。十六个小组依据各组性质和特点，进行专题讨论，使得各界代表均有充分的发言机会。如农民代表各小组，分别讨论了救灾生产，减租清债，合理负担，肃清土匪特务，反对恶霸等问题；文教组及青年组则讨论了有关教育工作、青年活动等问题。
    大会第三日，进行全体讨论，报名作中心发言者共达三十二人。各代表在发言中一致表示同意鹿鸣县长关于“四个月工作报告及今后工作方针”的报告。几位农民代表的发言，尤其博得全场一致的同情和拥护。王曲区农民代表董醒悟以他亲身受到的封建迫害，用算细帐方式来诉说农民的迫切要求。他说：“过去的日子实在难受，象我种了村上地主李老二的地，每年一亩地能打一石一斗左右，要交租子七大斗，他的斗又大，就等于七斗七升。穷人把苦受尽，苦了一年，到头收入还吃不饱。除还租外，单是上粪和水车费又要三、四斗。年成不好还要赔本。欠下租子，就得上山砍柴卖钱来补贴。可是地主们还说：‘不欠半年帐，不减荒年租’。遇到荒年，穷人就吃不上嘴，穿不上身。所以我今天要提出减租清债，望大家讨论研究出个办法来，让我们也有碗饭吃。”
    　　　　农民代表算帐诉苦要求打倒恶霸地主
    农民代表贺玉林、杨成甲、张富等也都根据他们村里的实际情况，控诉了封建地主的高租重利剥削，提出了减租减息的迫切要求。杨成甲坚决地说：“我是农民选举出来的。我要求的减租，并不是个人意见，这是农民大家的意见，这个意见就有了力量。大家回去要团结全体农民，这样才能够减租清债，斗倒恶霸地主。”农民代表雷登瀛也说：“要反封建，就要有组织。我们乡有了农会，坏人见了就害怕。可是我们的工作，过去也有毛病，没有好好地团结中农。这次回去，一定要把农会扩大，把中农团结好，并且要把这次会上的全部决议宣传下去，让大家动手来做。”农民代表发言后，民主人士、教育界人士、开明士绅的代表相继发言。民主人士程西净说：“过去我们对农民一点不了解，今天听了各位农民代表的话，使我很受感动。我们一定要和农民团结起来，和农民在一起进行农村改革。”民主人士王作栋说：“听了几位农民代表的发言，了解到农民的痛苦太多了，各位代表所要求的东西，我也同意。”这天会上，还有军队代表刘崇英讲述地方武装六支队的战斗和发展经过，和对今后整训的意见。工人代表艾绳儒建议政府解决失业工人职业问题和修理路巷。妇女代表李述知、容利毕提议组织农村劳动妇女，努力参加劳动生产和农村政治生活；逐步宣传，实行婚姻自由；设立助产学校，改进农村土法接生，发展农村妇婴卫生。青年学生代表惠维裕表示将动员青年学生深入农村，了解农村生活，向农民宣传人民政府各项政策。
    大会一致通过了鹿鸣县长关于四个月来的工作和今后工作方针的报告，并根据全县当前的实际情况，通过提案六十四件。会议并决议以“组织农会，建立农村人民政权，实行减租清理旧债，发展生产，支援前线，清剿土匪，肃清特务，改造教育”等项为目前的中心工作。大会通过了“长安县各界人民代表会议组织法”和该县农民代表大会提交讨论的“长安县减租清理旧债办法”。大会第四日，由鹿鸣县长解答问题并进行选举。大会选出二十五人为长安县各界人民代表会议常务委员会委员。大会随即在经久不息的口号声和掌声中胜利闭幕。
