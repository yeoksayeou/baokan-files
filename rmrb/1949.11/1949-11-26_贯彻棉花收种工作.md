　　Implement Cotton Harvesting and Planting Work
　　Xí Fengzhōu

　　In this year's autumn harvest seed selection campaign, all regions have attached considerable importance to the selection and retention of quality cotton seeds, making specific arrangements from top to bottom. After more than a month of organization and promotion, many regions have selected a large number of high-quality cotton seeds, which will play a significant role in increasing cotton production and improving cotton quality next year!

　　According to statistics from twelve cotton seed management areas in Hebei Province, including Tongxian, Nanyuan, Shijiazhuang, Handan, Linqing, Xiajin, Nangong, Langfang, Baxian, Tangshan, Lixian, and Yangliuqing, more than one million catties of quality seeds had been collected by early October. In addition, in the cotton-producing areas of Anyang, Xinxiang, and Xingtai prefectures in Pingyuan Province, the masses were also organized to select many ordinary quality seeds. In the past, some villages had no habit of selecting and retaining quality seeds, but this year they have all begun to retain seeds themselves. The fact that each county in Anyang Prefecture, Pingyuan Province, plans to mobilize the masses to retain large quantities of cotton seeds themselves indicates that this year's cotton seed selection work has broken all previous records in North China, becoming the basic solution to the current cotton seed problem.

　　Next year, a large amount of cotton will be planted, requiring many cotton seeds, especially relatively high-quality cotton seeds, which are in particularly urgent need. According to the planting plans of various regions for next year, the relatively good cotton seeds collected this year are not enough to meet the demand. In flood-stricken areas, many cotton fields were submerged, and there is no hope for harvest. Some also suffered greatly reduced harvests due to continuous rain, coupled with cotton pests (such as the pink bollworm) and excessive frost-affected flowers, all of which reduced the amount of cotton harvested and seeded.

　　This year's cotton harvesting and planting work is a crucial issue in determining whether the planting work can be completed next year. Therefore, in general cotton-producing areas, we should seize the opportunity during the cottonseed purchasing season, use effective methods to control large quantities of cotton seeds, and prepare to solve the difficulties of cotton seeds in the upcoming spring plowing. Cotton seed retention is seasonal; the seeds for next year's cotton fields need to be prepared this year. If preparations are made only when planting is imminent, the planting work will suffer losses.

　　In order to complete the cotton harvesting and planting work, the leadership should promptly and appropriately resolve a series of problems that arise in the current harvesting and planting work, to ensure the smooth progress of cotton harvesting and planting work.

　　In cotton-producing areas, oil mills need to use a large amount of cottonseed to extract oil. The cottonseed ginned by general mills is mostly sold to oil mills; moreover, oil mills prefer to collect good cottonseed (good cottonseed produces more oil) and not bad cottonseed. Therefore, at this time when various regions are ginning cottonseed, in order to prevent both the oil extraction industry and cotton seed retention work from being affected, various regions should have plans to select cottonseed. Pure, secondary-quality, or better cottonseed can be selected in large quantities for seed. Ordinary cottonseed should be used as raw material for oil extraction.

　　This year, the government has stipulated the collection of cotton in lieu of public grain in cotton-producing areas. Because the amount of cotton collected is relatively large, various regions should also combine this work with seed retention. Because the collected cottonseed contains many secondary-quality or better cottonseeds, which have higher yields and are suitable raw materials for machine spinning. If the cottonseed that can be used for seed cannot be utilized during the collection of cottonseed, the planting work will suffer losses.

　　To do a good job in cotton harvesting and planting, technical guidance should be implemented and necessary organizational work should be strengthened. In addition to the cottonseed retained by the masses in the fields through "selecting good and separating harvests," there is still a lot of cottonseed stored now. Under possible conditions, another round of selection must be carried out, and the selected better cottonseed should be organized to be ginned, which can also obtain a large number of cotton seeds.

　　This year, in many areas, because there was too much rain when the cotton was fluffing, many cotton bolls had not cracked even after the Frost's Descent festival, thus increasing the amount of frost-affected flowers. These seeds are mostly immature and have a low germination rate. In addition, because the pink bollworm was particularly severe in various regions this year, many cottonseeds were damaged by insects. According to statistics from the Junliangcheng Cotton Farm in the Tianjin Cotton Planting Guidance Zone, more than 16 percent of the cottonseeds were damaged. In other areas, the average is also more than 10 percent. Therefore, when harvesting and seeding, attention must be paid to removing insect-damaged seeds and retaining more healthy seeds.

　　All cottonseed retained for seed, after inspection, if immature seeds or insect-damaged seeds are found, the amount of seed retained should be increased when retaining seeds, so that there are enough seeds for sowing next year. If it is a good variety, more attention should be paid. The improved varieties promoted last year lacked seedlings after planting, and there were no improved cotton seeds to replenish the planting. Some even planted miscellaneous seeds in the improved variety cotton fields, resulting in a decrease in the purity of the improved variety.

　　Due to the different planting areas and the high and low cotton harvests in various regions, the cottonseeds harvested this year are not enough in some regions, and some regions cannot use them all. Cottonseeds are even more scarce in severely flooded areas and newly added cotton planting areas next year. Therefore, carrying out cotton seed adjustment work during this year's harvesting and seeding is very important. The method can be to adopt mutual adjustment between households, villages, or counties, or to purchase in neighboring cotton-producing areas. In the past, government agencies and cooperatives in various regions have done a lot of cotton seed adjustment work and achieved remarkable results. This year, when organizing the adjustment of cotton seeds, we should also use past experience to rely on the strength of the masses and local grass-roots organizations to promote it widely.

### 贯彻棉花收种工作

　　贯彻棉花收种工作
    席凤洲
    在今年秋收选种运动中，各地对于棉花选留良种，都相当重视，自上而下作了具体布置。经过一个多月的组织推动，在不少地区，已选出大量的优良棉种，这对于明年增加棉花产量与提高棉花品质，作用是很大的！
    根据河北省通县、南苑、石家庄、邯郸、临清、夏津、南宫、廊坊、霸县、唐山、蠡县、杨柳青等十二个棉花良种管理区统计，到十月初旬，即收集了良种百万余斤。另外，在平原省的安阳、新乡和邢台等专区产棉地区，也组织群众选出了很多普通良种。过去，有些村庄，本没有选留良种的习惯，今年都开始进行了自留良种，平原省安阳专区各县，今年计划发动群众大量自留棉种，说明今年的棉花选种工作，在华北打破了空前纪录，成为目前解决棉花种子的基本问题。
    明年要大量植棉，需要棉种甚多，特别是比较优良的棉种，更属迫切需要。按照各地明年植棉计划，今年所收的较好棉种，还赶不上需要。在水灾地区，有的棉田多被淹没，收成已无希望。有的也因不断阴雨，使收成大减，再加上棉花的虫害（如红铃虫）以及霜后花过多，都减少了棉花收种的数量。
    今年的棉花收种工作，是决定明年能否完成植棉工作的重要问题。因此，在一般产棉地区，应该抓紧，收购籽棉季节，运用有效办法，控制大量的棉花种子，准备解决将来春耕中棉种的困难。棉花种子的留种，是带有季节性的，明年棉田的种子，需要在今年准备好，如果临播种时再作准备，就会使植棉工作受到损失。
    为了完成棉花收种工作，在领导上应该根据当前收种工作中所发生一系列的问题，及时的加以适当解决，保证棉花收种工作顺利进行。
    在产棉地区，油房要用大量棉子去榨油，一般轧房轧出的棉子，多要卖给油房；而且，油房多收好棉子（好棉子出油多）不收坏棉子。因此，在这目前各地正轧籽棉时，为了使榨油工业与棉花留种工作两不受到影响，各地应该有计划的去拣选棉子，如纯种、次良种或较好的棉子，可大量选留作种。把一般普通的棉子做为榨油原料。
    今年在棉产地区，政府已规定征收棉花顶公粮，因为征收的棉花数量比较多，在进行这一工作时，各地也应该结合进行留种。因为征收的籽棉，其中有很多是次良种或较好的棉种，在产量上是较高的，在品质上是适合机器纺纱原料的。今年各地棉种缺乏，如果不能在征收籽棉时，把能作种用的棉子利用起来，就会使植棉工作遭受损失。
    棉花的收种工作要做得好，应贯彻技术指导和加强必要的组织工作。今年除各地群众在田间进行“选良分收”所留的籽棉外，现在存放的籽棉还很多，在可能条件下，须再进行一番挑选，将选出较好的籽棉，组织起来轧花，还可获得大量棉种。
    今年不少地区，在棉花吐絮时，因为阴雨过多，直到霜降节后，很多棉桃还没有开裂，因而增加了大量的霜后花，这种种籽多不成熟，发芽率低。另外，由于今年各地棉花红铃虫特别严重，很多棉子遭到虫伤，据天津植棉指导区军粮城棉场统计，被害的棉子在百分之十六以上。其他地区，平均也多在百分之十以上。因此在收种时，必须注意去掉虫伤子，多留健全子。
    凡是留种的棉子，经过检查以后，如发现有不成熟的子或虫伤子，在留种时，就应该增加留种量，以便到了明年播种时，有足够的种子。如系良种更得注意。在去年推广的良种，种后缺了苗，没有良种棉子补种，有的竟把杂子补种在良种棉田内，结果，降低了良种的纯度。
    由于各地植棉面积多少不同，及棉花收成的高低悬殊，今年收下的棉子，有的地区不够用，有的地区用不完；水灾严重地区和明年新增植棉地区，棉种更见缺乏。因此，在今年收种中，进行棉种调剂工作，就十分重要。办法可采用户与户、村与村或县与县的相互调剂，或在邻区产棉地收购。过去各地政权机关和合作社，曾做过不少调剂棉种工作，收到显著成绩。今年在组织调剂棉种时，还应该运用已往经验依靠群众力量及各地基层组织，广泛推行。
