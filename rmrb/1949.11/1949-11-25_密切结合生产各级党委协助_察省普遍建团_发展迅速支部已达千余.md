Closely Integrated with Production, Party Committees at All Levels Assist
Chahar Province Universally Establishes Communist Youth League
Rapid Development, Branches Exceeding One Thousand

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Chahar Province began establishing the Communist Youth League in February of this year. Various localities first carried out key construction of the League to gain experience, train cadres, and lay the foundation for universal League building. In July, the Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League summarized the experience of key League building in the first half of the year and put forward a plan for universally developing organizations within eight months. Most areas then fully launched League building work during various movements such as the autumn harvest, autumn planting, field seed selection, and tree planting. In the past two or three months, under the direct leadership of Party committees at all levels and the efforts of all youth cadres, the League's organization has been rapidly developed in various localities. According to statistics at the end of September, the province has 19,657 League members and a total of 1,020 branches, laying the foundation for the plan to develop 30,000 League members in eight months.

The biggest feature of the universal development of organizations is its close integration with the then-current autumn production movement. The League members developed are mostly activists who emerged in production activities such as autumn protection, autumn planting, field seed selection, and tree planting. League cadres mostly carry out League building work while mobilizing the masses to complete production tasks. Therefore, after the establishment of the League's organization, they can play a leading and exemplary role in production. For example, 116 of the 182 League members in the Ninth District of Hunyuan participated in field seed selection; in Jingshang Village, under the leadership of several League members, 26 young people selected 13.7 *shi* of seeds and 5,750 *jin* of Chinese yams; 19 of the 24 League members participated in the autumn protection team; in the tree planting movement in Moniwan, Huai'an, the League members were the backbone, and the whole village planted 25,000 trees; the Citianchuan Youth League in the Sixth District of Yanqing united more than 30 young people and children to collect more than 17,600 *jin* of tree leaves for famine preparedness (only 16 League members collected more than 14,000 *jin*), and under their leadership, 24 young people dug up medicinal herbs to exchange for 13.4 *shi* of sorghum. Many vivid exemplary instances have won praise from the masses in various places. The masses said that the Communist Youth League are truly "good young lads."

During the development process, Party committees at all levels have paid more attention to League building work. Facts have proved that where the Party cares more about the League's work, the League's work achieves greater results and makes greater contributions to the overall work. For example, in Huailai County, not only the county Party secretary, county magistrate, and other main responsible cadres paid attention to the League's work, calling on every cadre to assist in League building at various meetings, and emphasizing the League's role to the Party, but also other departments and district cadres provided great help to the League's work. For example, Song Letian, deputy minister of the county armed forces department, personally went to the countryside to help build the League. The Sixth District Party Secretary, the Fourth District Deputy Secretary, and others not only regularly and specifically helped young cadres plan their work but also personally went to the countryside to build the League. Many other cadres in the county also requested the Youth League Committee to issue League member introduction forms to help build the League when they went to the countryside. The Yanbei Prefectural Committee printed the booklet "How a Branch Builds the League," requiring all Party members to vigorously assist in League building.

Several Main Methods

The methods generally adopted in the universal development are roughly the following: First, on the basis of key areas, gradually disperse the cadres who are concentrated together to other villages to build the League. Second, develop the League's organization at any time through all Party cadres in various movements. Third, in the new districts, first mobilize the broad masses of young people, on the one hand, to become a force to promote work, and on the other hand, to use this to publicize the spirit of the League. Fourth, in cities, in addition to the Youth League Committees of Party branches in factories, schools, and various enterprises being responsible for League building, small training classes, forums, and other methods are also used to publicize the spirit of the League and develop the League's organization, so that they can be scattered to various units to become seeds of the League.

Several Main Deviations

However, there are still serious "closed-doorism" tendencies in development. Some young people in Fanshi and Xuanhua applied to join the League but were not approved, and they joined the Party a few days later. In Jijiaping, Datong County, admission to the League was not approved because the parents were backward. The Thirteenth District stipulated a probationary period for all League members admitted to the League. In Shalingzi, Xuanhua, there were already eight League members in March of this year, and there are still eight League members now. In Zhuolu Chengguan District, there are still only four League members after four months of League building. Some areas do not trust others in leadership and take over everything themselves. At the same time, there is another kind of deviation in certain areas. For example, some places do not look at the conditions and simply pursue numbers. The development in individual areas is too fast, and whether it is an acute illness remains to be thoroughly examined. Another deviation is that most areas have paid attention to the combination of League building and movement, but not enough help has been given to solve the special welfare of young people, such as learning, recreation, and marriage. This cannot meet the requirements of the broad masses of young people.

### 密切结合生产各级党委协助　察省普遍建团　发展迅速支部已达千余

　　密切结合生产各级党委协助
　　察省普遍建团
　　发展迅速支部已达千余
    【本报讯】察省从今年二月开始建团。各地首先进行了重点建团，以取得经验、训练干部，打下普遍建团的基础。七月份，团省委总结了上半年重点建团经验，提出了八个月普遍发展组织的计划，大部地区便在秋收、秋耕、田间选种、植树等各种运动中全面展开了建团工作。两三个月以来，在各级党委的直接领导及全体青年干部的努力之下，团的组织已在各地得到了迅速发展。至九月底统计，全省已有团员一九、六五七名，共一、○二○个支部，为八个月发展三万团员的计划奠定了基础。
    普遍发展组织中的最大特点，是和当时的秋季生产运动取得了密切结合，所发展的团员大部是护秋、秋耕、田间选种、植树等生产中涌现的积极分子。团的干部多是在发动群众完成生产任务下进行建团工作。因此，团的组织建立后均能在生产上起带头模范作用。如浑源九区一八二个团员就有一一六个参加了田间选种；井上村在几个团员的带头下二十六个青年选种十三石七斗、山药五、七五○斤；二十四个团员中有十九人参加了护秋队；怀安磨泥湾以团员为骨干的植树运动中全村植树二万五千棵；延庆六区的慈田川青年团团结了三十余个青年儿童为了备荒打树叶一万七千六百多斤（只十六个团员就打了一万四千余斤），并在他们的带头下二十四个青年刨药材换回高粱十三石四斗。许多生动的模范实例，深获各地群众赞许，群众说，青年团真是"好样的小伙子"。
    发展过程中各级党委更加重视了建团工作。事实证明：那里的党更关心团的工作，那里团的工作成绩就更大，对整个工作的贡献也就大。如怀来县不仅县委书记、县长等主要负责干部注意了团的工作，在各种会上号召每个干部要协助建团，强调青年团对党的作用，其他部门和区干部中也对团的工作有很大帮助，如县武装部副部长宋乐天亲自下乡帮助建团，六区区委书记、四区副书记等除经常具体帮助青年干部计划工作外，并亲自下乡建团，全县还有不少干部下乡时要求青委发给团员介绍表帮助建团；雁北地委印发了"支部怎样建团"的小册子，要求全体党员大力协助建团。
    　　　　几个主要方法
    普遍发展的方法大致是采用了以下几种：第一，在重点的基础上，把集中在一起的干部逐渐分散到其他村庄建团。第二，通过全党干部在各种运动中随时发展团的组织。第三，在新区首先是发动广大青年，一方面成为推动工作的力量，又可以用此宣传团的精神。第四，城市中除通过工厂、学校及各企业单位党支部的青委负责建团外，还采用了小型的训练班、座谈会等，宣传团的精神和发展团的组织，使他们分散到各单位后成为团的种子。
    　　　　几个主要偏向
    但发展中仍存在着严重的关门主义，繁峙及宣化有些青年要求入团未批准，而在几天后便入党了；大同县的吉家屏因家长落后而不批准入团，十三区则对入团团员一律规定了候补期；宣化沙岭子今年三月已有八个团员，到现在仍然是八个团员；涿鹿城关区建团四个月仍然还是四个团员。也有的地区领导上不相信别人，包办代替。同时在某些地区却有另外一种偏向，如有的地方不看条件，单纯追求数字等；个别地区发展太快，是否急性病尚待深入检查。再一个偏向就是大部地区建团与运动结合是注意了，但对青年的特殊福利，如学习、文娱、婚姻等问题帮助解决的不够，这样也不能满足广大青年的要求。
