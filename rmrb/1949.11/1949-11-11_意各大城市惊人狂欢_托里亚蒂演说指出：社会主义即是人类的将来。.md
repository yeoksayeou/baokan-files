Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 10th: TASS Rome, August 8th - Under the initiative of the Communist Party and the Socialist Party, the Italian working people held mass rallies in various cities across the country to celebrate the 32nd anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution. According to Avanti!, these rallies were astounding in terms of the scope and number of participants, as well as the enthusiasm and jubilant atmosphere of those attending. According to L'Unità, Communist Party General Secretary Togliatti delivered a speech at a rally held in La Spezia. Togliatti said that 32 years ago, when the workers and peasants of Russia, under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party and under the leadership of Lenin and Stalin, seized power into their own hands, few people outside Russia understood the epoch-making significance of this event. Today, the understanding of the importance of this great event and its amazing consequences has been deeply imprinted in the hearts of millions of people in various countries around the world. Today, people from all over the world can specifically judge what has happened in countries where the working class has seized power, and what is happening in the decadent and dying capitalist world. Today, socialism is expanding all over the world, because the capitalist system itself is creating new preconditions for the development of socialism every day and every hour. Togliatti emphasized the great historical significance of the victory of the Chinese people, elaborated on the achievements of the People's Democratic countries of Eastern Europe, and talked about the Soviet Union's consistent and firm defense of peace. Togliatti once again reminded the audience that despite all the conspiracies of the imperialist warmongers, the strength of socialism is advancing before the eyes of the world, and this is inevitable. He finally declared: "Thanks to the work and victory of our Soviet comrades, the whole world has the confidence that socialism will not retreat one step, socialism will surely win, and socialism is the future of mankind." According to Avanti!, Nenni delivered a speech at the celebration rally held in Brinisi and Grande. Addressing the working people of southern Italy who are fighting for bread and the right to work under difficult conditions, Nenni pointed out that the Soviet Union has achieved great success during its 32 years of existence in providing the greatest example of solving the centuries-old problems of work and security for the broadest masses. These problems are what the bourgeoisie could not and will not be able to solve in the future. ANSA reported that a mass demonstration was held in Turin to celebrate the anniversary of the October Revolution. Italian Communist Party Deputy General Secretary Scoccimarro delivered a speech at the celebration rally. Communist Party leader Colombi and Socialist Party leader Lombardi delivered speeches at the Milan rally. Similar celebrations were also held in Genoa, Savona, Naples, Bologna, Palermo, and other cities.

    意各大城市惊人狂欢
    托里亚蒂演说指出：社会主义即是人类的将来。
    【新华社北京十日电】塔斯社罗马八日讯：意大利劳动人民在共产党与社会党的发起下，在全国各城市举行了庆祝伟大的十月社会主义三十二周年纪念的群众大会。前进报报道，这些大会在参加者的范围与数量上和在参加者的热情与欢欣鼓舞的气氛上，都是惊人的。团结报报道，共产党总书记托里亚蒂在斯培西亚举行的大会上发表演说。托里亚蒂说，在三十二年以前，当俄国的工人和农民在布尔什维克党的领导之下、在列宁和斯大林的领导之下把政权夺到自己手中的时候，俄国境外的人很少了解这一事件所具有的划时代的意义。今天，对这一伟大事件的重要性及其惊人后果的了解，业已深深地印入世界各国的千百万人民的心里。今天，全世界的各国人民都能具体地判断。在工人阶级已把政权拿到自己手里的国家中，已发生了什么；而在腐朽的垂死的资本主义世界里，却正在发生着什么。今天，由于资本主义制度本身正每日每时都在为着社会主义的发展创造新的先决条件，社会主义正在全世界扩展着。托里亚蒂强调中国人民胜利的巨大历史性意义，详论东欧人民民主国家的成就，并谈到苏联一贯坚决保卫和平的情形。托里亚蒂再度提醒听众，尽管有帝国主义战争贩子的一切阴谋诡计，然而在全世界面前，社会主义的力量正在前进着，这是不可避免的。他最后宣称：“由于我们苏联同志的工作与胜利，全世界都有一种信心，社会主义将不后退一步，社会主义定将胜利，社会主义即是人类的将来。”据前进报报道，南尼在布林的西和大兰多举行的庆祝大会上发表演说。南尼向在困难的条件下为争取面包与工作权利而战斗的意大利南部劳动人民演说时，指出苏联在其存在的三十二年期间，在给最广大的群众解决成世纪以来的工作与安全问题的最伟大的范例上，获得巨大成就。这些问题，是资产阶级过去不能而且将来还是不能解决的。安萨通讯社报道，都灵举行了庆祝十月革命纪念日的群众示威。庆祝大会曾有意大利共产党副总书记谢嘉发表演说。米兰的大会上有共产党领导人物科隆比和社会党领导人龙巴迪发表演说。热那亚、萨窝那、那不勒斯、波伦亚、巴勒摩及其他城市也曾举行了同样的庆祝会。
