　　The Pathology of Plague
    Plague has a long history. There was a major epidemic in Europe in the past, which killed 25 million people in three years. Although there have not been plagues as large as this since then, they still occur frequently. In China, there was a fairly large plague in the Northeast from 1910 to 1911, which killed 60,000 people in seven months. Another epidemic occurred from 1920 to 1921, with 10,000 deaths. Based on these experiences, we know that plague is an acute and very virulent infectious disease. The plague bacillus is very small, about 2/1,000,000th of an inch long and about 4/1,000,000th of an inch in diameter. A needle point can hold 300 million of them. Don't underestimate this bacterium because it is small, but its toxicity is very high, and it reproduces very quickly. Therefore, only a few plague bacilli need to enter the human body to quickly multiply into tens of millions. After the disease develops, it can often cause death within 24 hours to a few days.
    Due to the different paths of bacteria entering the human body, plague can be mainly divided into two types: one is bubonic plague, which is caused by plague bacteria being transmitted through the skin; the other is pneumonic plague, which is caused by humans inhaling plague bacteria from the air. Regardless of the mode of transmission, after the bacteria enter the human body, they can immediately spread to all parts of the body. In addition to the lymph nodes and lungs, organs such as the heart, liver, spleen, kidneys, intestines, stomach, and blood can be infected.
    Now, let's talk about the onset of bubonic plague and pneumonic plague, and the physiological changes in the human body during the onset of the disease separately.
    First, let’s talk about bubonic plague. After the bacteria are transmitted to humans through fleas, the bacteria travel from the bite site to the skin, causing local damage and causing blisters, pustules, or bleeding spots on the skin. At the same time, some bacteria invade nearby lymphatic vessels. We know that there is lymph fluid flowing in the lymphatic vessels, and its flow carries the plague bacteria to the lymph nodes. If the skin of the lower limbs is bitten by fleas containing bacteria, the plague bacteria can be carried from the local lymphatic vessels to the lymph nodes in the popliteal fossa or all the way to the inguinal lymph nodes in the groin. We also know that lymph nodes act as a filter in the human body, performing a filtering function. All substances that are harmful to the body or not needed by the body are retained when they pass through here, preventing them from continuing to circulate inside the body. Since plague bacteria are harmful to the body, they are retained when they reach the lymph nodes, but this is only temporary and does not solve the problem because the toxicity of the plague bacteria is very high and they reproduce quickly. The plague bacteria can cause acute lymphadenitis, bleeding, edema, and even death of the lymph node tissue itself in a very short time within the lymph nodes. And it can cause the same lesions in the tissues near the lymph nodes. The infected and diseased part becomes very swollen. If we use a syringe to extract some fluid from the swollen part and examine it under a microscope, we can see countless tiny plague bacteria.
    The site of bubonic plague occurs in the inguinal lymph nodes in 70% of cases, which, as mentioned above, are the inguinal lymph nodes in the groin because there are more opportunities for the lower limbs to be bitten, and most of the lymphatic vessels in the lower limbs and lower abdomen converge here. Secondly, 20% of bubonic plague occurs in the armpits. As for bubonic plague occurring in the neck, that is, in the cervical lymph nodes, it is relatively rare. This is because the area of convergence is limited to the head and neck, and there are not many opportunities to be bitten in these two places.
    When the local lymph nodes are swollen, some plague bacteria have spread from the lymph nodes and the surrounding tissues and entered the second line of defense, that is, the second group of lymph nodes. This group of lymph nodes will also develop inflammation, bleeding, edema, putrefaction and other lesions. Not only that, but some plague bacteria also invade the blood vessels and spread throughout the body through the blood. Therefore, if we take the blood of a sick person and culture it, we can often find bacteria. When the bacteria spread throughout the body in the blood, the symptoms become more serious.
    Of all the organs affected by plague bacteria, the lungs are the most important to humans. After the bacteria are transmitted to the lungs, they cause pneumonia. This pneumonia is more severe than ordinary acute pneumonia. At this time, the alveoli that originally contained air are filled with countless bacteria and white blood cells that died as a result of fighting the bacteria. At the same time, the blood vessels in the lungs rupture due to the toxicity of the bacteria, resulting in bleeding in the lungs. At this time, some lung tissue also becomes corrupted and necrotic for the same reason. In this case, the patient coughs, expectorates, and the sputum often contains blood. Every bit of sputum contains countless plague bacilli. In addition to the lungs, other organs are also damaged by the plague bacteria. When the gastrointestinal lining is infected, there will also be bleeding and ulceration. The ulcerated area contains many bacteria. The bacteria in it can be mixed in the stool and excreted, so care must be taken when handling the patient's stool.
    If the kidneys are infected, acute hemorrhagic nephritis can also occur, so the patient's urine also contains bacteria. Therefore, attention must also be paid to the handling of the patient's urine.
    In addition, in addition to small pustules or bleeding spots on the skin due to flea bites, and even ulceration, ulceration can also be caused by plague bacteria brought by the blood. If plague bacteria invade the meninges, meningitis will occur. The spleen and liver will enlarge after being infected, and there will be bleeding. In addition, the heart, the ovaries and uterus of women, and the testicles of men, etc., will also have bleeding after being infected.
    From this we can know that the lesions of people suffering from bubonic plague are not limited to the lymph nodes. In fact, all organs of the body are poisoned, resulting in hemorrhagic acute inflammation and tissue putrefaction and necrosis. At the same time, the bacteria are not only present in the lymph nodes, but also in large quantities in the organs, wounds, blood, feces, urine, and sputum of all parts of the body, which are very easy to spread.
    Now let’s talk about pneumonic plague:
    Pneumonic plague is more serious than bubonic plague. After the disease develops, serious cases can die within 24 hours. The mortality rate is also high, almost 100%. The reason is that bubonic plague bacteria can be temporarily limited to the local area. By the time the bacteria reach other parts, the body already has some resistance, which prolongs the course of the disease.
    Patients with pneumonic plague, because the bacteria are inhaled through breathing, first reach the lungs. The lungs have a large area, so the scope of infection is also wide.
    The lesions in the lungs of patients with pneumonic plague are severe hemorrhagic lobar pneumonia. The alveoli are filled with countless bacteria, dead white blood cells, and red blood cells flowing out of the already poisoned and ruptured blood vessels, making it impossible to obtain sufficient air, thus causing difficulty in breathing. After the lungs are infected with plague, the lung lymph nodes also have plague bacteria, which can also invade the blood, causing the same lesions as mentioned above in bubonic plague.
    All in all, plague bacteria multiply quickly in the human body and are highly toxic. All tissues that come into contact with it are damaged, causing a hemorrhagic inflammatory lesion. Therefore, if we want to know whether a dead person has plague, that is, whether there is a plague epidemic in this area, we must examine the dead person's body, because if the patient dies quickly after the onset of the disease, the doctor will not have the opportunity to make a clinical diagnosis. Therefore, whenever a corpse suspected of having plague is encountered, an autopsy should be performed immediately to determine whether the death was caused by plague. This is of great benefit to the early detection of plague.

　　鼠疫的病理
    鼠疫的历史很久了，从前在欧洲曾经有过一次大流行，三年之内死了两千五百万人。以后虽然没有流行过象这样大的鼠疫，但仍是常常发生。在中国，一九一○到一九一一年，东北曾经发生过一次相当大的鼠疫，七个月里面死了有六万人。在一九二○年到一九二一年又曾经流行过一次，死亡有一万人。根据这些经验，我们知道鼠疫是一种急性而且非常猛烈的传染病。鼠疫菌的菌体很小，长约二百万分之一寸，直径约有四百万分之一寸，一个针头的大小就可以放三十万万个。别看这种病菌小，但是毒力却很大，而且繁殖的又非常快，所以只需要几个鼠疫杆菌侵入到人的身体里面，很快的就可以繁殖成几千万个，病发以后，往往可以使人在二十四小时到几天时间里面死亡。
    由于细菌侵入到人身体的路径不同，鼠疫主要可以分为两种：一种是腺鼠疫，是鼠疫病菌由人的皮肤传染进来的；另一种是肺鼠疫，是由于人从空气中吸入了鼠疫菌而引起的。无论受传染的方式如何，病菌侵入到人身体以后，立即可以散布到身体各部分，除了淋巴腺和肺脏以外，心、肝、脾、肾、肠、胃、血液等器官都可以受传染。
    现在把腺鼠疫和肺鼠疫的发病，和在发病期间所引起人身体生理上的变化，分别来讲一下。
    先谈谈腺鼠疫。病菌经过跳蚤传到人身上来以后，病菌就从被咬的地方跑到皮肤里，引起局部的损害，使皮肤发生水泡、脓泡或者出血点儿。同时另有一部分病菌侵入了附近的淋巴管。我们知道淋巴管里面，经常有淋巴液流行，因为它的流行便把鼠疫菌带到淋巴腺。如果是下肢的皮肤被含菌的跳蚤咬伤，那么鼠疫菌就可以从局部淋巴管被带到膝盖窝部分的淋巴腺，或者一直到大腿窝的腹股沟的淋巴腺。我们又知道淋巴腺在人身体里面如同一个滤过器，有滤过作用。凡是有害身体或身体不需要的物质，经过这里的时候就被阻留，防止继续往身体内部流行。既然鼠疫菌是对身体有害的，所以当它走到淋巴腺的时候便被阻留住了，但是因为鼠疫菌的毒性很大，而且繁殖又快，所以虽然被阻留住了，仅仅是暂时的，不能解决问题。鼠疫菌在淋巴腺里面很短的时间就可以引起急性淋巴腺炎，出血、水肿，甚至于使淋巴腺本身的组织死亡。并且能够使淋巴腺附近的组织发生同样的病变。受传染起了病变的部分非常肿大。若是我们用空针在肿大的部分抽出一点夜体，放在显微镜下检查，就可以看到无数的细小的鼠疫菌。
    腺鼠疫发生的部位，百分之七十是在鼠蹊淋巴腺，就是上面所说在大腿窝的腹股沟淋巴腺，这是因为下肢被咬伤的机会比较多，同时下肢和下腹部的淋巴管多半汇集在这里。其次有２０％的腺鼠疫是发生在腋窝。至于发生在脖子部分就是颈淋巴腺的腺鼠疫比较少。这是由于汇集的面积只限于头和脖子，而且这两个地方被咬的机会不多。
    当局部的淋巴腺肿大的时候，有一部分鼠疫菌已经从淋巴腺和它周围的组织散布出去，进入到第二道防线，也就是第二组淋巴腺。这一组淋巴腺同样也要发生发炎出血，水肿，腐化等的病变。不但如此，另外还有一部分的鼠疫菌侵入了血管，经过血液散布到全身。所以把得病的人的血液取出来培养，每每可以查出病菌来。当病菌在血液散布到全身以后，病状就更严重了。
    各器官受到鼠疫菌的侵害，对于人来说，要算肺最重要，病菌传到肺以后，就引起肺炎。这种肺炎，比一般的急性肺炎要厉害。这时候原来含空气的肺泡里面，就被无数的病菌和因为与病菌斗争而死亡的白血球所充满了，同时肺里面的血管因为受了病菌的毒害而破裂，以致于肺有出血现象；这时候，一部分肺组织也因为同样原因腐化坏死。在这种情形下患病的人就咳嗽，吐痰，痰里面还常常带血，在每一点点吐出来的痰里面，就含有无数量的鼠疫杆菌，除了肺以外，其他器官也同时受到鼠疫菌的损害。肠胃内膜受到传染的时候，也会有出血现象，并且形成溃烂。溃烂部分含有病菌很多，这里面的病菌，可以混杂在大便里面排泻出来，所以处理病人的大便，必须小心。
    要是肾脏受到传染，也能够发生急性出血性的肾脏炎，所以病人小便里面，也含有病菌。因此对于病人尿液的处理也须要注意。
    此外，皮肤除了因为跳蚤咬伤会发生小浓泡或者出血点，甚至于形成溃烂以外，还可以因为由血液带来的鼠疫菌而引起溃烂。要是鼠疫病菌侵入了脑膜，就会发生脑膜炎。脾脏、肝脏受了传染都要增大，而且会有出血的现象。此外，心脏，女性的卵巢子宫，和男性的睾丸等。受到传染以后，也有出血的现象。
    由此可以知道得了腺鼠疫病的人，他的病变并不是仅仅限于淋巴腺，实际上是全身各器官都受到毒害，以致于有出血性的急性炎症和组织的腐化坏死等情形。同时病菌也不仅限于存在在淋巴腺，全身各部的器官，伤口，血液，大便，小便和痰液里面都含有大量的鼠疫病菌，非常容易散播出来。
    下面讲一讲肺鼠疫：
    肺鼠疫比腺鼠疫更严重，病发作以后，严重的可以在二十四小时里死亡。死亡率也高，几乎是百分之百。理由是因为腺鼠疫病菌，可以暂时限于局部，等到病菌到达其他部分的时候，身体已经有了若干抵抗力存在，这样就延长了病程。
    得肺鼠疫的病人，因为病菌从呼吸吸入，首先到达肺脏，肺的面积大，所以受传染的范围也广泛。
    肺鼠疫患者，肺内的病变，是剧烈的出血性大叶肺炎，肺泡被无数的病菌，死亡的白血球和从已经受毒害而破裂的血管里面流出来的红血球所充满，没有办法再得到充足的空气，于是发生呼吸困难。肺受到鼠疫传染以后，肺部淋巴腺也接着有了鼠疫菌，同样可以侵入血液，引起了象上面讲到在腺鼠疫里面所引起的同样的病变。
    总起来说，鼠疫菌在人身体里繁殖的很快，毒力又大，凡是和它接触的组织都受到损害，引起了一种出血性的炎性病变。因此我们要想知道病死的人是不是得的鼠疫，也就是说这一个地方是不是已经有鼠疫流行，必须检验死人的尸体，因为要是病人发病很快的就死了，医生没有机会可以做临床诊断。所以凡是遇到有鼠疫嫌疑的尸体应当立即施行尸体检查，确定是不是因为鼠疫而死，这样对于鼠疫的早期发现，有很大的好处。
