The Benefits of Plague Vaccination

Whether in areas where plague has already occurred or in epidemic prevention areas, adults and children should be vaccinated against the plague.

What are the benefits of plague vaccination? We know that human blood contains two things: serum and blood cells. Our immunity can be expressed in the serum. If we put a few bacteria in a test tube containing immunized serum and then put it under a microscope, we will see the serum quickly agglutinate the bacteria, eventually killing or digesting them. This is a sign of resistance. However, this resistance is general, meaning it can resist any kind of bacteria for a while. If we can specifically train it, the situation is different. The role of vaccination lies here. Taking plague as an example, if we now inject specially cultured, non-toxic, harmless live plague bacteria or toxic but killed plague bacilli into the human body, it will cause the serum to produce a large number of antibodies against plague bacilli. The antibodies have the opportunity to learn how to fight the enemy of plague bacteria, and we usually say that it increases resistance to plague. Then, when real plague bacteria come in, there is a greater chance of eliminating them. This is the effect of plague vaccination.

Some people have strange ideas. No matter how you persuade them to get vaccinated, they don't believe that vaccination will be beneficial, and they take their lives as a joke out of stubbornness. Don't believe it? Let's look at the facts. According to surveys in India, Java, and the Dutch East Indies, the average ratio of people who died of plague after being vaccinated with bacterial vaccines to those who were not vaccinated is one to four. There is also a practical example from the Northeast. The cadres in Chengzijing, Qian'an County, Liaobei Province, were vaccinated the year before last, and they were in contact with patients every day, but none of them got sick. Some people in Chengzijing who were unwilling to get vaccinated all got sick and died. There was also a village where, when the epidemic prevention workers went to administer the vaccine, the men went to work in the fields, and the women at home were vaccinated. During that plague outbreak, none of the women died, but many of the men died. We can say that people who have been vaccinated, plus their own carefulness, six or seven out of ten people can avoid getting the plague. Even if the other three or four people are infected, it will be easier to cure.

How is the plague vaccine administered? Currently, there are two types of plague vaccine: one is a killed vaccine, and the other is a live vaccine. The killed vaccine is administered in three injections. The first is 0.5 cc, and the second and third are both 1 cc. The time interval between each two injections is one week, and at most should not exceed ten days. Regarding the dosage for children, generally children between the ages of three and eight use one-third of the adult dose, children between the ages of eight and fifteen use one-half of the adult dose, and those over fifteen can be injected according to the adult dose. Children under three years old should also be vaccinated, and the dosage can be determined by the doctor.

In plague areas or areas threatened by plague, in order to save time, 1 cc can be injected for the first time, so that with two injections, there will be considerable immunity, and it is naturally better to inject the third time.

The live vaccine is administered in one injection, and the dosage is also 1 cc. The efficacy of the live vaccine is three to five times better than the killed vaccine.

Both types of plague vaccine are administered subcutaneously. The killed vaccine is usually injected in the upper arm, and the live vaccine is best injected under the scapula to avoid redness and swelling in the upper arm after injection, which makes movement inconvenient. For children, the injection site can be on the back to prevent them from scratching it.

During the injection, strict attention should be paid to the disinfection of the equipment. The bottles containing the vaccine are sealed with rubber stoppers, and these stoppers must not be opened. Disinfect the lid with iodine or alcohol, and then insert the needle to draw the vaccine. At the same time, the color of the vaccine is milky white. If the color changes, it means that the vaccine is spoiled and can no longer be used. These things should be especially noted by medical personnel.

After the injection, there are usually some reactions. The reactions to the killed vaccine are generally not significant, while the reactions to the live vaccine are more significant, but they also vary depending on the individual's physical condition. Local reactions include redness, swelling, and pain at the injection site. Systemic reactions include fever, headache, and feeling unwell. Sometimes there will also be vomiting. These are normal phenomena of severe reactions after injection and are not surprising. During the reaction period, it is not suitable to be too tired, and alcohol should not be consumed.

After the vaccination, the effective period of immunity can be maintained for four to six months. After this period, it should be re-injected.

Before the injection, it should be noted that those who have acute infectious diseases, or whose cardiac function is decompensated, or who have severe chronic liver and kidney diseases and open pulmonary tuberculosis are not suitable for injection. As for whether pregnant women should be injected, this needs to be determined based on the pregnant woman's body and the specific environment. There are healthy pregnant women who are already seven or eight months pregnant, and after injecting the killed vaccine, the results were not bad. The main thing is to look at the environment. In non-plague areas, pregnant women over eight months do not need to be injected. However, in areas where the plague is already very severe, we feel that it should still be injected, even if it causes miscarriage or even damages the life of the child, it can save the life of the adult. Compared with contracting the plague, where both the adult and the child die, and expanding the scope of plague transmission, it is still much better. However, in what environment should the injection be given, must be carefully handled by the doctor, depending on the actual needs, to decide whether to inject or not.

The above mentioned the effectiveness of the vaccine, the injection method, and some things to pay attention to. It can be said with certainty that vaccination is effective in preventing the plague. However, if someone becomes careless because they have been vaccinated, eats indiscriminately, approaches people with plague, does not clean the house, and does not take care of rats and fleas, it is still not appropriate. Vaccination is not an absolute prevention of plague, and it is still necessary to pay attention to and implement other epidemic prevention measures.

### 注射鼠疫预防针的好处

　　注射鼠疫预防针的好处
    不管在鼠疫已经发生的区域里，或者是防疫区域里，大人小孩都应该注射鼠疫预防针。
    注射鼠疫预防针有什么好处呢？我们知道人的血里有血清和血球两样东西，我们的抗体力可以在血清内表现出来，当我们放几个细菌在盛有经过免疫的血清试管里，再放在显微镜下面，就看见血清很快地把细菌凝结起来。最后把它杀死或消化掉，这就是抵抗力的表示。可是这种抵抗力的作用是泛泛的一般的，就是说对待任何一种细菌都可以抵抗一阵。假使我们能够专门训练它一下，情形就不同了。注射防疫针的作用就在这里。拿鼠疫来讲罢，我们现在如果把经过特别培养出来的没有毒的，不会害人的鼠疫活菌或者是有毒而已经杀死的鼠疫杆菌，注射到人身体内去，使得血清里产生大量对抗鼠疫杆菌的抗体，抗体有机会熟悉如何对抗鼠疫菌这个敌人，我们通常就说增加对鼠疫的抵抗力，那么真的鼠疫菌进来，就有更多的可能把它消灭掉，这就是注射鼠疫预防针的效用。
    有少数的人想法很奇怪，不管你怎么劝他让他打针，他总不相信防疫针会有好处，凭着一股子蹩扭劲儿拿自己的生命做儿戏。不信吗？我们且拿事实来看，根据印度、爪哇及荷属东印度的调查，注射过菌苗的人和没有注射菌苗的人，死于鼠疫的人数比例平均是一比四。又有东北的一个实际例子，前年辽北省乾安县称字井的干部都打了针，天天和病人接近，也都没得病。称字井一些不愿打防疫针的人，都得病死了。还有一个村子，在防疫员去打药针的时候，男人都下地干活去了，女人在家都打了针。在那次闹鼠疫的时候，女人都没有死，男人死了很多。我们可以说打了预防针的人，再加上自己小心，十个有六七个人可以不闹鼠疫，即使那三四个人被传染了，也容易治好。
    防疫针怎么打呢？就现在来说，预防鼠疫药针有两种，一种是死菌苗，一种是活菌苗。死菌疫苗是分三次注射，头一次是半Ｃ．Ｃ．，第二和第三两次都是一Ｃ．Ｃ．。每两次之间，时间上的间隔是一个礼拜，至多不能超过十天。关于小孩的注射量，一般是三岁到八岁之间的儿童，用成人剂量的三分之一，八岁到十五岁的儿童用成人剂量的二分之一，十五岁以上就可以按照成人的剂量注射。三岁以下的孩子也应该注射，注射量可以由医生斟酌。
    在鼠疫区域或者受鼠疫威胁的地区里，为了争取时间，头一次就可以注射一Ｃ．Ｃ．，这样能注射两次，就有了相当的防疫力，自然能注射第三次更好。
    活菌疫苗是一次注射的，注射量也是一Ｃ．Ｃ．。活菌菌苗的效力比死菌疫苗要好三倍至五倍。
    两种不同疫苗的鼠疫预防针，都是皮下注射，死菌苗通常注射在上臂上，活菌苗为了怕注射之后上臂红肿活动不方便，最好是注射在肩胛骨下部。小孩子注射的地方，怕他抓弄，可以注射在背上。
    在注射的时候，应该严格地注意器械的消毒，装疫苗的瓶子都是用橡皮塞子，这个塞子千万不能打开。将盖子用碘酒或者酒精消过毒，再用针头插入，抽取菌苗。同时疫苗的颜色是乳白色，要是变了颜色，就是疫苗已经坏了，不能再用。这些事情特别是医务人员应该注意。
    打了针之后，通常是有一些反应的。死菌疫苗一般的反应并不大，活菌疫苗就比较大一些，但是也随着人的体质的不同有些轻重的不同。局部的反应是注射的地方有些红肿疼痛，全身的反应就是发烧、头痛感觉不舒服，有时候还会呕吐，这都是注射以后反应厉害的正常现象，并没有什么奇怪。在反应期间，不适宜太劳累，也不可以喝酒。
    注射防疫针之后，防疫的有效期间可以保持四个月至半年。过了这个期间，应该再注射。
    在注射之前，应该注意凡是害急性传染病的，或者心脏机能代偿作用失调的人，或者得重症、慢性肝肾病和开放性肺结核的人，都不适宜注射。至于孕妇是不是应当注射，这个须要看孕妇的身体和具体环境来决定。有身体健康的孕妇怀孕已经七八个月，注射了死菌疫苗之后，结果并没有什么不好。而主要的是要看环境，在非鼠疫区里，孕妇在八个月以上可以不必注射。但是要在鼠疫已经闹得很厉害的区域里，我们觉得还是应该注射的，即便是因打针而流产甚至损害了小孩的生命，但是可以保全大人的生命，比起传染上了鼠疫，大人小孩全都死去，而且扩大了鼠疫的传染范围，还是好得多。不过究竟在什么环境下应该注射，必须由医生仔细处理，看实际需要，决定注射或不注射。
    上面说了防疫针的效用，注射方法和应该注意的一些事情，注射了防疫针对于预防鼠疫，可以肯定地说是有作用的，但是要是有人因为打了针，便大意起来，乱吃东西乱接近得鼠疫病的人，房子也不打扫，老鼠跳蚤也不去管它，还是不妥当。打了针并不是可以绝对的预防鼠疫，还是须要注意和执行其他防疫的办法。
