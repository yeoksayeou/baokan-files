　　Learning and Thought
    Kang Shouli
    Since the liberation of Beijing, the study of new theories and the education and influence of the new practical environment have broadened my horizons and expanded my scope of thought, giving me a new understanding of various things.

    Chairman Mao said, "Because the situation is developing so fast, everyone feels the need to re-learn." Especially for those of us who have been newly liberated, we need to establish a new outlook on life and also need to step up our learning to catch up with the needs of the situation. In this case, learning will be the most important part of all our work.

    To clarify our thinking, enrich revolutionary theory, and establish a revolutionary outlook on life, we can only rely on learning. We grew up in the old society, and whether in consciousness or in life, we have more or less problems and stains. Learning can fundamentally transform our thinking, which is an effective medicine for curing these problems and stains. So, what attitude should we have towards learning?

    First, learning should be conscious and active. Because we are in this great and progressive era of the people, only by learning and studying hard can we ensure that we do not lag behind or fall behind.

    Second, learning should be widely connected with reality and with one's own thoughts. Everything we hear and see, if we can absorb it, will help us. I have this experience that I often read an article or a story in the newspaper, and combined with my own thoughts, it will give me a lot of inspiration. Various practical educations are of great help to personal learning.

    Third, we should learn fundamentally, targeting the problems in our own thinking. In the past, I was superstitious about the "prosperity" and "democracy" of American imperialism, and I was skeptical about the Soviet Union. I analyzed the formation of this kind of thinking, which was due to the long-term reactionary propaganda of the Kuomintang reactionaries, and at the same time, I did not fundamentally understand the essence of socialism and imperialism. This requires a fundamental solution. During a period of time, I paid special attention to studying documents on capitalism, imperialism, and analyzing imperialism. After studying the White Paper on American Imperialism, my understanding of the essence of imperialism became clearer than before; and then, in connection with the actual situation in our country, I analyzed American imperialism and the Soviet Union, and realized who was the enemy and who was the friend, and fundamentally solved my confused thinking. From this problem, I linked it to Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary and traitorous crimes, and realized what Chiang Kai-shek was; I linked it to the significance and future of the People's Liberation War and the People's Revolution, and my vision was greatly broadened, my thinking was clarified, and my revolutionary confidence was enhanced. This series of problems were fundamentally solved only through learning.

    The New Democratic society is a university, and we are all students. Comrades! Let us unite closely, step up our learning, and stride forward together under the great banner of Mao Zedong!

　　学习与思想
    康守礼
    北京解放以后，由于新的理论的学习，以及新的实际环境对我的教育与影响，使我扩大了眼界，开展了思想范围，使我对于各种事物开始有了新的认识。
    毛主席说：“由于形势发展得这样快，每个人都感觉到有重新学习的需要”。尤其是新解放出来的人们，既需要建立新的人生观，也需要加紧学习赶上形势的需要。在这种情况下，学习将是我们一切工作中最重要的一环。
    把思想搞通，丰富革命的理论，建立革命的人生观，惟有赖于学习。我们是在旧社会中生长起来的，无论在意识上，生活上，或多或少，或轻或重，都有毛病和污点。学习可以从根本上改造思想，也就是医治这些毛病和污点的特效药。那么，我们对于学习，应抱怎样的态度呢？
    第一，学习应是自觉的，主动的。因为我们逢此伟大的、进步的人民时代，只有学习，努力学习，才能保证我们不落伍，不掉队。
    第二，学习要广泛联系实际，联系自己的思想。凡是耳闻的、眼见的，假如我们能吸取的话，对我们都有帮助。我有这样的经验，常常在报纸上读了一篇文章，一篇故事，结合着自己的思想，会给我很大的启示。各种实际的教育，对个人的学习帮助很大。
    第三，针对着自己思想上的毛病，从根本上去学习。过去我曾迷信美帝的“繁荣”、“民主”，对苏联曾抱怀疑的态度。我分析了这种思想的形成，是由于国民党反动派长期反动宣传的蒙蔽，同时自己对于社会主义与帝国主义本质上根本不理解。这就要从根本上解决。在一个时期内，我特别注意钻研学习论资本主义，帝国主义和分析帝国主义的文件。在学习了美帝白皮书之后，对帝国主义的本质，认识较前明确了；进而连系我国实况，分析美帝，分析苏联，认识了谁是敌人，谁是朋友，从根本上解决了我的糊涂思想。由这个问题联系到蒋介石反动卖国的罪行，认识了蒋介石究竟是个什么东西；联系到人民解放战争和人民革命的意义与前途，眼光放大了好多，明确了思想，增强了革命信心。这一系列的问题，都是有了学习才从根本上解决了的。
    新民主主义的社会是个大学校，我们都是学生。同志们！让我们紧紧地团结在一起，加紧学习，在伟大的毛泽东旗帜下，大踏步共同前进！
