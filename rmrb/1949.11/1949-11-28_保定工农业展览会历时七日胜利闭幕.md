　　Baoding Industrial and Agricultural Exhibition Concludes Successfully After Seven Days

[Our Dispatch] The Baoding Industrial and Agricultural Products Exhibition, which lasted seven days, closed on the 21st. The exhibition featured 1,288 industrial and agricultural products, and was visited by 52,000 people. Enthusiastic visitors offered 147 suggestions for improvement and praise for the exhibits, which will greatly promote industrial and agricultural production in Hebei Province in the future. At the same time, the exhibition organized an awards committee. After democratic evaluation, eight exhibitors were awarded prizes, and seventeen were commended. Chen Huanran, a worker at the Yimin Factory in Dingxing, created a hand-operated chaff cutter that allows one and a half laborers to cut 1,000 catties of grass per day, greatly saving labor, and was awarded the second prize. Items of poorer quality also received criticism from the audience. Farmer representatives from the Hejian visiting delegation said, "Baoding pickles have been famous historically, but now they are made poorly." The exhibition also invited farmer representative visiting delegations from various places to discuss the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas. The farmer representatives provided many valuable opinions on industrial products and future urban-rural trade. For example, Baoding business representatives mentioned a lack of oil pressing raw materials and cotton, etc., and the farmer representatives pointed out that these items were available in rural areas and needed to be purchased by industrialists and businessmen. After they introduced their respective situations to each other, they also stipulated specific methods of contact, which will greatly help the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas in the future.

　　保定工农业展览会历时七日胜利闭幕
    【本报讯】历时七日的保定市工农业产品展览会，已于二十一日闭幕。该展览会共有工农业产品一千二百八十八件，参观群众达五万二千人。热心的观众们，对展品提出了一百四十七条改进与表扬的意见，对今后河北工农业生产将起很大的推动作用。同时，该展览会组织了评奖委员会，经过民主评议后，参加展览的有八户产品受到奖励，十七户受到表扬。定兴益民工厂工人陈焕然创造的手摇铡草机，一个半劳动力，每日铡草一千斤，大大节省劳动力，得到第二名奖状。质量较差的物品，也受到了观众的批评，河间参观团农民代表说：“保定酱菜从历史上就著名，可是现在做坏了”。展览会并邀请各地农民代表参观团座谈城乡物资交流，农民代表对工业产品及今后城乡贸易上提供了许多宝贵意见。如保定工商界代表提出缺乏榨油原料及棉花等，而农民代表即提出这些东西农村都有，需要工商业家去收购。他们互相间介绍了各自情况后，又规定出具体联系的办法。将对今后城乡物资交流帮助很大。
