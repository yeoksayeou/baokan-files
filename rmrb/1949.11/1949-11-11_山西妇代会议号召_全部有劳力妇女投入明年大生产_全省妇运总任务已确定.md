Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 9th: The Shanxi Provincial Women's Congress was held from the 20th to the 29th of last month. A total of eighty-nine representatives attended. The main content of the meeting was to examine and summarize the women's work in the province over the past year, and to determine the direction and tasks of the provincial women's movement for next year. Participants unanimously agreed in their review that the women's work in Shanxi over the past year had basically implemented the policy of focusing on production and had achieved considerable success. All parts of the province mobilized women to participate in agricultural production on a scale exceeding any previous year, thereby raising the status of women in the family and enlightening women's political awareness. However, due to some cadres' insufficient understanding of the overall direction and tasks of the women's movement, many deviations still occurred in the work. For example, in some areas, the organization of women to participate in production did not take into account their household labor, causing family dissatisfaction. Some areas only emphasized mobilizing women to participate in production and neglected to appropriately address their own special problems, paying no attention to the fact that many women were still suffering from feudal oppression and abuse. Some areas only solved women's personal problems while neglecting to mobilize women to participate in production.

After review, the meeting clearly put forward the general task of the women's movement in the province in the future: to better mobilize and organize the broad masses of women to actively participate in various construction tasks in the new Shanxi, especially the restoration and development of Shanxi Province's industry, agriculture, handicrafts, and sideline production. In the process of restoring and developing production, carry out women's cultural and health education, and establish and promote women's and children's welfare undertakings; eliminate the feudal shackles on women. The meeting called on all able-bodied women to fully invest in the great production movement next year and strive to restore Shanxi's agricultural production to the level before the War of Resistance Against Japan. The conference determined that all localities should organize women to participate in winter production, winter schools, and cultivate activists this winter to lay the foundation for carrying out the women's movement and the entire production and construction next year.

    山西妇代会议号召
    全部有劳力妇女投入明年大生产
    全省妇运总任务已确定
    【新华社太原九日电】山西省妇女代表会议于上月二十日至二十九日举行。出席代表共八十九人。此次会议的主要内容是：检查与总结一年来全省妇女工作，确定明年全省妇女运动的方针和任务。与会者在检讨中一致认为一年来山西的妇女工作基本上执行了以生产为中心的方针，获得了不少成绩。全省各地发动了妇女参加农业生产，其规模超过以往任何一年，因此，提高了妇女在家庭中的地位，启发了妇女的政治觉悟。但由于若干干部对整个妇女运动的方针与任务认识尚不够明确，因此工作中还出现了不少偏差。如有的地区组织妇女参加生产时，没有照顾其家庭劳动，引起家庭不满。有的地区只强调发动妇女参加生产，而忽视对其本身特殊问题的适当解决，对不少妇女依然遭受着封建压迫与虐待的事实不加注意。有些地区则只解决妇女切身问题而忽视发动妇女参加生产。
    经过检讨后，会议明确提出全省今后妇女运动的总任务为：更好地发动与组织广大妇女群众积极参加新山西的各项建设工作，特别是恢复与发展山西省的工业、农业、手工业及副业生产。在恢复和发展生产的过程中，开展妇女文化卫生教育，创办与推进妇女儿童福利事业；解除对妇女的封建束缚。会议号召一切有劳动力的妇女明年全部投入大生产运动，为山西农业生产恢复到抗日战争前的水平而斗争。大会确定今冬各地即应组织妇女参加冬季生产，参加冬学，培养积极分子，为开展明年妇女运动及整个生产建设打下基础。
