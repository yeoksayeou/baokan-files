    Through the Create New Records Movement
    Shenyang Mechanical Plant No. 3
    Work Appearance is Brand New
    Production Efficiency Continuously Improves, Gradually Implementing Economic Accounting
    [Reported by this newspaper] The three-month record-breaking campaign at Shenyang Mechanical Plant No. 3 has given the factory a completely new look. Through the Create New Records movement, the plant is gradually implementing an economic accounting system, guiding the factory towards a production upsurge. This mechanical plant mainly produces six-foot lathes and radiator fins. The machinery, equipment and technical conditions are relatively superior. The machinery and equipment have increased from 90 units to 189 units since we took over. The models, casting, riveting, forging, and various lathes are generally more complete. The number of employees has also increased from 110 to 1,164, of which more than 60% are skilled workers, many of whom are veteran technicians with six, seven, or even more than ten years of experience. However, the production situation has always been sluggish, and labor productivity is extremely low, with monthly production plans consistently unfulfilled. Due to poor production organization, systems, and management methods, there are frequent shortages of spare parts, materials, and castings, causing machines to stop working due to waiting for materials. Moreover, due to an imperfect inspection system and a lack of clear specifications, rejected products account for more than 6%, material waste accounts for 2%, and labor waste accounts for more than 4%, resulting in enormous waste. There are many reasons for these phenomena. First, the factory's administrative leadership is not familiar with production and does not closely rely on workers to mobilize their enthusiasm and creativity, but simply relies on technical personnel. They even believe that some workers are "active in production but ideologically backward." Second, the trade union work is divorced from production, focusing all its efforts on welfare and busying itself with running cooperatives and pancake shops. The trade union does not have a high reputation among the workers. Third, there are still various concerns among the workers, and they have not demonstrated a high level of labor enthusiasm. Among the core worker contingent, there are more than one hundred veteran technicians, forty of whom were former members of reactionary parties and groups. They consider themselves politically backward and carry burdens. The leadership also believes that transforming them is not a task that can be accomplished in a day and has not paid attention to guiding them to give full play to their technical talents. In addition, the egalitarian wage system further makes workers uninterested in improving production.

### 通过创造新纪录运动  沈阳机械三厂  工作面貌一新  生产效率不断提高逐步贯彻经济核算

    通过创造新纪录运动
    沈阳机械三厂
    工作面貌一新
    生产效率不断提高逐步贯彻经济核算
    【本报讯】沈阳第三机械厂三个月来的创纪录运动，使工厂全部工作面貌一新，且通过创造新纪录运动逐步贯彻经济核算制，引导工厂走上生产的高潮。该机械厂，主要是生产六英尺车床及暖气锅炉散热片。机器设备和技术条件都比较优越。机器设备自我接管后已由九十台增为一百八十九台，模型、翻砂、铆锻，各种车床等一般都较完善。职工人数亦由一百十人增至一千一百六十四人，其中技术工人占总数百分之六十强，而且多是六七年以至十多年工龄的老技工。但是，生产状况则始终是不景气的，劳动生产率极低，每月都不能完成生产计划。由于生产机构制度管理方法不善，经常发生备品、材料、铸件供应不上，使机器因待料而停工的现象。又因检查制度不健全，没有明确的规格，以致报废产品占百分之六强，料废占百分之二，工废占百分之四强，浪费浩大。产生这些现象的原因很多。其一是工厂行政领导方面对生产不熟悉，又不紧紧依靠工人，发动工人的积极性与创造性，而单纯信赖技术人员。甚至还认为有些工人“生产积极，思想落后”。其二是工会工作脱离生产，集中全力搞福利，忙于办合作社开煎饼铺，工会在工人群众中威信不高。其三是工人中尚有各种顾虑，没有发挥高度劳动热情。工人中坚分子的百余老技工中有四十人曾是反动党团分子，他们自认政治上落后，背了包袱；领导上也认为改造他们非一日之功，没有注意引导他们发挥技术才能。加之平均主义的工资制度，更使工友对提高生产不生兴趣。
