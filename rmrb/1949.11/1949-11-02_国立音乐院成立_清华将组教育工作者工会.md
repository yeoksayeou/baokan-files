    【北京讯】清华大学正酝酿建立教育工作者工会。该校教职联副主席解沛基于十月三十一日晚上，在师生工警三千多人参加的上大课时，报告全校教授、讲师、助教、职员和工警将要组成统一的教育工作者工会的问题。他在报告中指出：这是脑力劳动者和体力劳动者在组织上的结合。他号召教职员们要和工人站在一起，更要坚决地改造自己。他并希望成立统一的工会后，能更好地帮助校委会，贯彻新民主主义的教育方针。全校教职员工听了这个报告后，将展开关于组织统一工会问题的全面讨论，最近即将正式成立清华教育工作者工会。
    又：该校在同一次上大课时，费孝通教授代表校委会向全校师生员工宣布：清华将要召开包括教授、讲助、工警、同学和妇女的各团体代表大会，共同讨论清华工作的总方向，并订出今后半年的方针。
