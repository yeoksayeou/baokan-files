Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 29th: TASS, Calcutta, November 28th—The All-India Peace Conference concluded on November 27th. The conference elected an All-India Permanent Peace Committee headed by Shadiah. The headquarters of the Permanent Committee will be located in Bombay.

The conference unanimously adopted a declaration to the people of India. The representatives and guests attending the conference listened with great enthusiasm to the congratulatory telegram from the Soviet delegation, which the Indian government had forbidden from entering the country to attend the conference. Cheers saluting Comrade Stalin and the Soviet Union reverberated through the hall for a long time.

More than 60,000 people participated in a mass rally held in Calcutta's city square in the evening. The audience vehemently protested the ban imposed by the police under the British colonial law promulgated in 1865, which is still in effect, prohibiting the progressive All-India People's Theater Association from staging dramas prepared for the conference delegates that promoted peace and democracy and exposed Anglo-American warmongers and their lackeys.

Representatives of the conference and progressive Calcutta trade unions delivered speeches at the meeting, demonstrating the Indian people's determination to fight for peace, exposing the conspiracies of Anglo-American imperialists in India, and unmasking the Indian reactionaries who curry favor with Anglo-American warmongers and take actions that harm the interests of the Indian nation.

The audience responded with unanimous applause to the songs performed at the meeting, which were dedicated to the Peace Conference, to the people's struggle for land and democracy, and to the imprisoned Indian revolutionary leaders.

Songs dedicated to the Soviet people's struggle for peace and to the People's Republic of China were particularly successful.

At night, parades celebrating the All-India Peace Conference were held in various districts of Calcutta.

Declaration

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 29th: TASS, Calcutta, November 28th—The All-India Peace Conference, which closed on November 27th, unanimously adopted a declaration to the people of India. The declaration exposed the conspiracies of imperialist warmongers to endanger world peace. The declaration emphasized that in various parts of the world, such as Greece and Vietnam, Burma and Malaya, the armed forces of American, French, and British imperialism are carrying out military intervention, directly assisting anti-democratic forces and suppressing the people in these countries who are fighting for national independence and democracy.

The declaration also exposed the reactionary essence of the policies pursued by the Nehru government, which agreed to India remaining within the British Empire, "thus forcing India to participate in military blocs headed by Anglo-American imperialism." The declaration stated: "Against the will of the Indian people, the Nehru government is forcing India to participate in the implementation of American and British military aggression plans in Asia, helping the reactionary, anti-democratic governments of Vietnam, Burma, and Malaya to take action against the people of these countries." The heavy burden of military spending is placed on the shoulders of the Indian people, who are suffering from unemployment, poverty, and unbelievably high prices. A real terror campaign is being carried out against the people to deprive them of the right to organize trade unions and democratic rights. The declaration pointed out that peace is currently the most important demand of the people, and called on all Indian men and women to condemn political and military measures aimed at turning India into a military bridgehead, and to abandon plans to have India participate in the American and British aggressive military bloc.

The All-India Peace Conference welcomed the declaration of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace and pledged to support the Permanent Committee of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace in Paris.

The declaration concluded: "We uphold the Charter of the United Nations, we oppose all military alliances that violate the Charter of the United Nations and lead to war. We advocate banning the use of atomic weapons for war purposes and establishing international supervision for the implementation of this ban. We advocate peaceful cooperation between all countries on the basis of respecting their independence and maintaining mutual equality."

"In line with the declaration of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace, we declare that defending peace is the cause of the people of the world. We salute the people of the Soviet Union, the Eastern European people's democracies, and the people of free China, who, together with all freedom-loving people in all countries, form a worldwide peace front and are now the strongest and invincible guarantee of maintaining peace. We assure them that we will unite all people of different races, beliefs, and occupations to condemn war preparations, prevent the use of Indian resources to suppress the independence of other nations, and unite to defend the democratic rights of the people, protest the heavy burden of military spending, and prevent them from using us to engage in war preparations. The struggle for peace is the struggle for freedom, democracy, and life. Let us unite so that we can be victorious in this battle for peace!"

　　全印和平大会胜利闭幕
  　选出和平常设委员会会址设孟买
    大会宣言保证团结印人争取和平
    【新华社北京二十九日电】塔斯社加尔各答二十八日讯：全印和平大会于十一月二十七日结束。大会选出以夏狄亚为首的全印和平常设委员会。常设委员会的会址设在孟买。
    大会一致通过告全印人民的宣言。出席大会的代表和来宾以巨大的热情听取了印度政府不许入境参加大会的苏联代表团的贺电。向斯大林同志与苏联致敬的欢呼声，长时间响彻会场。
    六万余人参加了于晚间在加尔各答市广场举行的群众大会。听众猛烈地抗议警察根据一八六五年颁布而至今仍然有效的英国殖民法所强加的禁令，该项禁令禁止上演进步的全印民间剧院协会为大会的代表们所准备的、宣传和平与民主和揭露英美战争贩子及其奴仆的戏剧。
    大会代表和进步的加尔各答工会的代表，在会上发表演说，表明了印度人民决心为争取和平而斗争，露揭英美帝国主义者在印度的阴谋，及揭穿讨好英美战争贩子，采取危害印度民族利益行动的印度反动派的面具。
    观众对于在会上表演的歌曲，一致报以喝采，这些歌曲是献给和平大会，献给争取土地和民主的人民斗争及被囚禁的印度革命领袖的。
    献给苏联人民争取和平斗争以及献给中华人民共和国的歌曲，都得到特别巨大的成功。
    夜间，加尔各答各区举行了庆祝全印和平大会的游行。
    宣言
    【新华社北京二十九日电】塔斯社加尔各答二十八日讯：十一月二十七日闭幕的全印和平大会，一致通过了告印度人民的宣言。宣言揭露了帝国主义战争贩子危及全世界和平的阴谋。宣言强调，在世界各处，例如希腊和越南、缅甸和马来亚，美、法、英帝国主义的武装力量正进行着军事干涉，他们直接援助反民主的力量，镇压这些国家中为民族独立和民主而斗争的人民。
    宣言并揭露尼赫鲁政府所奉行的政策的反动实质，这个政府同意印度留在大英帝国之内，“因而迫使印度参加以美英帝国主义为首的军事集团”。宣言称：“违反着印度人民的意志，尼赫鲁政府强迫印度参加实施美英在亚洲的军事侵略计划，帮助越南、缅甸和马来亚的反动的反民主的政府，进行反对这些国家人民的行动”。沉重的军事开支负担，加在为失业、贫穷和不可置信的高昂物价所苦的印度人民肩上。对人民进行着真正的恐怖运动，以剥夺他们组织工会的权利和民主权利。宣言指出和平在目前是人民的最重要的要求，并号召印度一切男女来谴责旨在把印度变成军事桥头堡垒的政治和军事措施，废弃使印度参加美英侵略军事集团的计划。
    全印和平大会欢迎世界拥护和平大会的宣言，并保证支持巴黎世界拥护和平大会常设委员会。
    宣言在结语中称：“我们维护联合国宪章，我们反动一切违反联合国宪章并导向战争的军事联盟。我们主张禁止为战争目的使用原子武器，并建立对于执行这一禁令的国际监督。我们主张一切国家在尊重其独立并维持相互间的平等的基础上和平合作。”
    “我们与世界拥护和平大会的宣言一致地宣告：保卫和平是全世界人民的事业。我们向苏联、东欧人民民主国家和自由中国的人民致敬，他们与一切国家中一切爱好自由的人民，共同组成了世界规模的和平阵线，并且现在是保持和平最强有力的和无敌的保证。我们向他们保证，我们将团结一切不同种族、信仰和职业的人民，谴责战争准备，防止利用印度资源来镇压其他民族独立的军事措施，并团结起来保卫人民的民主权利，抗议军事开支的沉重负担，不许他们利用我们来从事战争准备。争和平的斗争是争自由、民主和生活的斗争，让我们团结起来，以便在这个争取和平之战中取得胜利！”
