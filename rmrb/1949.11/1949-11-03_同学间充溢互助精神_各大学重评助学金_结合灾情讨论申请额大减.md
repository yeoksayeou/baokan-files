Mutual Assistance Spirit Abounds Among Students
　　Universities Re-evaluate Scholarships
　　Application Amounts Significantly Reduced in Light of Disaster Situation

　　[Our Newspaper News] A comprehensive report from various university correspondence groups: Since the universities in Beijing began re-evaluating People's Scholarships in mid-October, the work has now entered its final stage. The Teachers' University held a meeting one day to summarize the experiences and gains of the work. Peking University, Tsinghua University, and Jiaotong University's Beijing Branch have also recently completed group evaluations and department-level evaluations. Fu Jen Catholic University also made a summary on October 26th. Through this movement to re-evaluate scholarships, students have further recognized the significance of People's Scholarships, experienced in practical matters how to be responsible to the people, thereby establishing correct learning viewpoints, and enhancing the spirit of mutual assistance among students. Before the evaluation, the scholarship evaluation committees of each school made full ideological mobilization and preparation work. They generally organized daily life and study groups as evaluation groups under the principle of mutual understanding, organized each group to discuss the Higher Education Association's "Decision on Re-evaluating Scholarships," reviewed the shortcomings and biases of the previous semester's evaluation work, and clearly formulated re-evaluation plans. After discussions by all 130 student groups at Tsinghua University, students who did not apply for scholarships also participated in the evaluation work to examine their own thinking and help other students progress. They regarded the evaluation work as a new topic for learning to serve the people. Before the evaluations, Peking University and Teachers' University's various departments and organizations put out wall posters and publications, combined with this year's disaster situation, calling on everyone to evaluate seriously and responsibly. During the evaluation period, wall posters, blackboards, and large-character posters were used for criticism and praise. In the group discussions of each school, the two principles of "necessity" (economic necessity) and "should" (studying hard and willing to serve the people) indicated in the Higher Education Association's decision were followed. The entire evaluation process clearly demonstrated the ideological struggle between the students' "for the people" and "for themselves" thoughts. With the help of full ideological mobilization work and serious and responsible collective criticism and praise at Peking University, many students overcame the selfish thoughts of "for themselves" through fierce ideological struggles, and many model deeds emerged. The number of students applying for scholarships in the second, third, and fourth grades of the liberal arts, science, and law departments decreased by more than 100, and the number of applicants for Grade A scholarships decreased from 556 to 328, saving a total of more than 10,000 catties of millet per month. At Teachers' University, 602 people participated in the re-evaluation, and only 269 people applied for Grade A, resolving the thoughts that "teachers college students should be fully publicly funded" and "teachers college students should enjoy special treatment" that had always existed in the minds of Teachers' University students. They said: "We are one family with the working people and should not have a hiring mentality." In Jiaotong University's Beijing Branch, many departments did not have a single applicant for Grade A. They compared their own living standards with those of the disaster-stricken peasants. Some students said with emotion: "My family is indeed in difficulty; but I am embarrassed to ask my parents for money. Am I not even more embarrassed to ask for money from farmers who live even harder lives than us?" Many students who had no source of income and met the conditions for applying for a Grade A scholarship jointly applied for "Grade A and B mutual assistance" (one person applies for Grade A, and one person applies for Grade B). There were also some students with relatively abundant sources of income who automatically helped economically disadvantaged students in their group, enabling them to lower the grade of their scholarship application, thereby enhancing the spirit of unity and mutual assistance among students.

　　同学间充溢互助精神
  　各大学重评助学金
  　结合灾情讨论申请额大减
    【本报讯】综合各校通讯组报导：北京市各大学于上月中旬展开重新评议人民助学金的工作以来，到目前为止已进入结束阶段。师大一日开会总结了工作中的经验和收获。北大、清华、交大京院亦于日前完成了小组评议和系级评议。辅大也在十月二十六日作了总结。通过这次重评助学金的运动，使同学们进一步认识了人民助学的意义，在实际问题上体验到如何对人民的负责，进而确立了正确的学习观点，并增进了同学之间的互助精神。在评议之前，各校评委会均作了充分的思想动员和准备工作，他们普遍地都是在互相了解的原则下以日常的生活学习小组为评议小组，组织各小组讨论高教会“关于助学金重评工作的决定”，检讨上学期评议工作的缺点与偏向，并明确的作出重评计划。清华全体同学一百三十个小组经过讨论后，不申请助学金的同学也都参加了评议工作，借以检查自己的思想，并帮助别的同学进步，他们把评议工作当做是学习为人民服务的新课题。北大、师大在评议前各系级、各社团纷纷出壁报与书刊结合着今年灾情号召大家严肃负责地评议，评议期间更以壁报、黑板报、大字报进行批评与表扬。在各校小组讨论中都能按照高教会决定中所指示的必需（经济情况上必需）与应该（学习努力并愿为人民服务）两个原则进行评定。整个评议过程明显地表现了同学们的“为人民”与“为自己”的思想斗争过程，北大在充分的思想动员工作及集体严肃认真的批评与表扬的帮助下，许多同学经过激烈的思想斗争克服了“为自己”的自私思想而出现了不少模范事迹。文、理、法二、三、四年级申请助学金的同学减少了百余人，申请甲种的由五五六人减少到三二八人，总计每月可省小米万余斤。师大六百零二人参加重评，只有二百六十九人申请甲种，一向存在于师大同学思想上“师范生应当是全公费生”“师范生应享特殊待遇”的思想获得了解决。他们说：“我们和劳动人民是一家人，不应该有雇佣观点”。交大京院有很多系级没有一个申请甲种的。他们把自己的生活水准和受灾的农民比较，有的同学感动地说：“我的家境固然困难；但我不好意思向爹妈要钱，难道就好意思向生活比我们更苦的农民要钱吗？”很多经济无来源具备申请甲种助学金条件的同学两个人联合申请“甲乙互助”（一人申请甲种，一人申请乙种）。还有某些经济来源较充裕的同学自动帮助小组内经济困难的同学，使其能降低申请助学金的等级，增进了同学间的团结互助精神。
