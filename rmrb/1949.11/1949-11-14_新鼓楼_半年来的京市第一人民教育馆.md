New Drum Tower
    ——The Beijing First People's Education Center in the Past Six Months

    The Drum Tower – this folk education center, which before liberation was used by the rulers to embellish "popular education," has been returned to the people since March 25th of this year and officially renamed the Beijing First People's Education Center. Thanks to the correct leadership of the Municipal Education Bureau and the concerted efforts of the center's cadres, it has now become a place for the general public in the northern part of the city to learn and entertain themselves, truly playing a role in educating the people.

    In the early days of the takeover, the exhibition hall displayed outdated models that were detached from the actual lives of the people; the reading room was filled with reactionary books, feudal, pornographic, and bizarre martial arts novels, as well as the "reading room" in Yuele Hutong in the eastern city, which was just an empty shell, and a cinema in the Bell Tower. On this dilapidated and decaying foundation, the past six months have been spent clearing out the old and building the new, gradually restoring and developing this cultural and educational undertaking that is related to the entire northern city's residents.

  Adopting Three Methods to Organize Citizen Learning

    First, the reading room was transformed. The dust-covered portraits of the ruling class on the walls were removed and replaced with pictures introducing new knowledge and concise, eye-catching large-scale slogans; old books were reviewed and eliminated, and new books were added. Despite the current difficult economic conditions, there are still more than 800 new books, bringing the total, including old books, to more than 12,000. Since borrowing began at the end of March, the number of readers has reached 47,856, an average of more than 6,000 per month. On the busiest day, the number of readers reached more than 450. Compared with the average of 500 to 1,000 readers per month before liberation, this shows how eager the citizens are to learn after liberation! Naturally, this is inseparable from the efforts of the Folk Education Center cadres to help readers in many ways. They have created the following three methods to help readers learn: 1. Organize reading seminars, organize active members who often read in the reading room, and use them to promote the learning of general readers, and reflect situations and opinions in a timely manner to facilitate improvement of work; 2. Whenever a learning center is determined, concentrate on the books related to it and actively introduce them to readers to help them learn; 3. Whenever an activity center arrives, collect relevant materials from the newspaper, cut and paste them into a information column for readers to study and refer to. Many readers often bring notebooks and copy while reading here.

  Various Photo Exhibitions – A Good Form of Mass Education

    Before liberation, the exhibition hall had 2,891 exhibits. After the takeover, 448 items with reactionary content and lacking educational significance were removed, and more than 1,000 new domestic products were added. There are now a total of 3,443 exhibits, divided into five rooms: natural science, plants and animals, hygiene, industry, and history and geography. In addition, the room also regularly hosts various photo exhibitions. Since the opening, a total of nine exhibitions have been held. The content of the photos includes an introduction to the life of children in the liberated areas, industrial construction in the liberated areas, the active situation of young workers in the liberated areas, Chairman Mao's arrival in Beijing, the Beijing entry ceremony, a million-strong army going south of the Yangtze River, the International Peace Congress, and the historical facts of the Anti-Japanese War and the War of Liberation. The number of visitors reached more than 18,000. From this number, it can be seen that this is one of the best forms of mass education. It can enable literate intellectuals and illiterate children and elderly women in the countryside to educate themselves through realistic images, gain combat experience, and enrich their knowledge.

  Expanding Remedial Schools and Establishing Five Types of Remedial Classes

    The center's civil school education work has also been developing and consolidating in the past six months. From an initial number of 163 students, it has grown to 548 students, and the number of classes has increased from three to ten. According to their nature and target audience, they are divided into: vocational training classes, women's remedial classes, children's literacy classes, workers' night schools, and shop assistants' morning schools. In the early stages of operation, there was a phenomenon of low student morale due to a lack of consideration for the rest time and cultural level of the target audience. This is being corrected after review. For example, comrades from the district trade union committee who are familiar with workers' lives are invited to give lectures to workers, and the study time has been changed to an alternating-day system, so that civil school work is gradually improving.

  Regular Public Lectures are Deeply Welcomed by the Masses

    The center has created many methods of educating citizens in the past six months, and regular public lectures are one of the more successful methods. This work only started on October 11th, and a total of ten lectures have been held so far. The time is from 6:30 pm to 8 pm every Tuesday and Saturday, and the content is determined in conjunction with the central tasks and learning centers at the time or according to the needs of the masses. So far, the following issues have been discussed: "Introduction to the Soviet Union," "Sino-Soviet Relations," "Unemployment and Employment Issues," "The Establishment of the People's Republic of China," "The White Paper," and "Prevention of Plague." The main purpose of adopting this educational method is to solve the learning problems of general unorganized citizens, as one old man who listened to the lecture said: "I have lived for decades, but I never thought that I would still have the energy to learn today. In the past, the Kuomintang didn't care about these things at all. Today, it is rare that the Folk Education Center is willing to help us. I hope that it can teach us more new knowledge in the future." Obviously, they sincerely love this learning method. Due to the initial development of the work, there are inevitably still shortcomings. For example, the comrades responsible for giving the lectures are all cadres from other agencies, and they cannot concentrate their time and energy, and they cannot answer the questions raised by the masses after listening to the lectures in a timely manner. In addition, there are also limitations in material conditions, such as the narrowness of the lecture hall, which cannot accommodate a large number of people. The center is making every effort to improve these shortcomings.

    In addition, the center also has three tea houses attached to the People's Bazaar. The tea houses are equipped with popular books and periodicals, and blackboard newspapers; there are question and answer services and writing services to help the masses answer difficult questions; and mass evening parties are held in the Bell Tower Cinema to show slides and peep shows. In addition, a singing team and a propaganda team were organized by citizens to carry out propaganda in coordination with the municipal construction center; on October 8th, the center added a recreation room, equipped with volleyball, table tennis, various chess games, gongs and drums, etc., to carry out citizens' cultural and recreational activities.

  Propaganda and Education Penetrate into Market Tea Houses and Organize Citizens' Cultural and Recreational Activities

    In this way, the Folk Education Center has taken root among the general public in its work in the past six months. Now, in the northern part of the city, when people talk about "strolling around the Drum Tower," they are no longer in the same mood of "leisure and boredom" as in the past, but regard it as the most beloved garden for seeking knowledge.

    新鼓楼
    ——半年来的京市第一人民教育馆
    鼓楼——这所解放前为统治者点缀“民众教育”的民教馆，自从今年三月廿五日复归为人民所有，正式改为京市第一人民教育馆后，由于市教育局的正确领导和该馆干部的一致努力，现在已经成为北城广大市民学习和娱乐的场所，真正发挥了教育人民的作用。
    该馆在接管初期，陈列室里陈列的是脱离人民实际生活的残旧模型；阅览室的书籍多是内容反动，充满封建、色情、怪诞的武侠小说，以及僻处东城演乐胡同空具架子的“阅书报处”和钟楼的一座电影院。在这残破糜烂的基础上，半年来清扫旧的，建设新的，逐步地恢复与发展了这一关系着整个北城市民的文化教育事业。
  采用三种方式组织市民学习
    首先是改造了阅览室。清除了壁上尘封的统治阶级的人物像，代替以介绍新知识的图画和精辟醒目的巨幅标语；审查与淘汰旧书，添购新书。虽在目前困难的经济条件下，到现在仍然有了新书八百余册，连同旧书共一万二千余册。自三月底借阅以来，阅览人数达四万七千八百五十六人，平均每月六千多人，在最多的一天，阅览人数曾达到四百五十余人，和解放前每月平均阅览人数五百人至一千人比较起来，说明了解放后的市民是多么渴望学习！自然，这些是和民教馆干部多方帮助读者学习的努力分不开的。他们共创造了以下三种帮助读者学习的方法：一、组织读书座谈会，组织经常到阅览室阅读的积极分子，通过他们去推动一般读者学习，及时反映情况和意见，以利于改进工作；二、每当一个学习中心确定之后，便集中与此有关的书籍，主动介绍给读者，以便帮助他们学习；三、每逢一个活动中心到来，便收集报上有关材料，剪贴编成资料栏，以供读者学习参考。不少读者还经常挟着笔记本在这儿边看边抄。
  各种照片展览  良好的群众教育形式
    陈列室在解放前计有陈列品二千八百九十一件，接管后经剔去内容反动及缺乏教育意义者四百四十八件，新添国货陈列品一千余件，现共有陈列品三千四百四十三件，分为自然科学、动植物、卫生、工业、史地等五室陈列。此外该室还经常举办各种照片展览。开馆迄今共举办了九次，照片的内容包括解放区儿童的生活介绍，解放区工业建设，解放区青年工人活跃情形，毛主席抵京，北京入城式，百万雄师下江南，国际和平代表大会，抗日战争及解放战争的史实介绍等。参观人数计达一万八千余人。从这个数目字，可以看出这是对群众教育最好的形式之一。它可以使识字的知识分子和不识字的儿童与乡下老大娘，都能通过现实的形象来教育自己，取得斗争经验和丰富自己的知识。
  扩大补习学校设五种补习班
    该馆民校教育工作，半年来也一直在发展与巩固着。从最初学生人数一百六十三名发展到现在的五百四十八名，班数从三班增加到十班。按性质和对象分为：职业训练班、妇女补习班、儿童识字班、工人夜校、店员晨校等。在举办的初期，曾因没有照顾到对象的休息时间和文化水平，一度发生学生学习情绪不高的现象。经检讨后已在纠正中。如请区工委会熟悉工人生活的同志来给工人讲课，学习时间改为隔日制，使民校工作逐渐改善。
  定期大众讲座深获群众欢迎
    该馆半年来创造出不少教育市民的方法，定期大众讲座便是其中较成功的方法之一。这项工作是从十月十一日才开始的，至今共举办十次，时间是在每星期二、六的晚上六时半至八时，内容是配合着当时的中心任务与学习中心或根据群众的要求来决定，到目前为止，共讲过：“苏联介绍”，“中苏关系”，“失业就业问题”，“中华人民共和国的成立”，“白皮书”，“预防鼠疫”等问题，采用这一教育方式，主要是为了解决一般无组织的市民的学习问题，正如听讲的一位老大爷所说：“活了几十岁，想不到今个还有这劲头来学习。过去国民党压根儿就不管这些，今天难得民教馆肯帮助咱，希望往后能更多教给我们些新知识。”显然地，他们是衷心地热爱这一学习方式的。由于工作初步展开，不免还有缺点存在，譬如负责主讲的同志，都是其他机关的干部，时间和精力上不能集中专一，对群众在听讲后提出的问题，未能及时给予解答。此外，还有物质条件的限制，如讲堂狭隘，容纳不了大量群众便是一个例子。对于这些缺点，该馆正在尽力改进中。
    另外该馆还在人民商场里附设了三个茶社，茶社内设有通俗书刊、黑板报；设问事问字代笔处，帮助群众解答疑难问题；并利用钟楼电影院开群众晚会，放映幻灯、拉洋片等。此外，并组织市民成立歌咏队、宣传队，配合市政建设中心进行宣传；十月八日，该馆又增辟一游艺室，内设排球、乒乓球、各种棋类、锣鼓等，以开展市民文娱活动。
  宣教深入商场茶社组织市民文娱活动
    就这样，民教馆在半年来的工作中，已经在广大市民层中扎了根。现在，在北城一带，人们谈起“逛鼓楼”，已经再也不是过去那副“消闲散闷”的心情了，而是把它当作求知识的最心爱的园地。
