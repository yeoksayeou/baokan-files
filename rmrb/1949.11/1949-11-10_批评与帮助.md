　　Criticism and Help
　　Ke Feng
　　There was a comrade who had not been working for long, and his overall qualities were relatively poor. Therefore, the people around him had a somewhat disdainful attitude towards him, which affected unity. In a general meeting, everyone severely criticized him, making him emotionally unable to accept it. The meeting ended without result and did not achieve the desired effect. Later, after several individual talks, he realized his shortcomings ideologically. Finally, another meeting of mutual self-criticism and criticism was held, and the problem was resolved.

　　This incident made us realize that comrades should have a sincere and united attitude when working together. In order to consolidate unity and ensure the smooth progress of work, mutual self-criticism and criticism are also necessary. For comrades who have just started working, we should care for them in many ways and help them in many ways. If problems are discovered, they should be pointed out in time and helped to correct them, rather than accumulating them for a final reckoning. If a more serious mistake is made, he should be enlightened in many ways to make a self-criticism, help him analyze the nature and causes of the mistake, and truly solve the problem ideologically, so that he feels the concern and help of his comrades. This will make it easier for him to accept and correct his mistakes. If a mistake is made, a rigid general meeting criticism is conducted, the problem cannot be solved ideologically, and sometimes the opposite effect occurs.

　　No comrade can avoid making mistakes. The question is how to be brave in recognizing and correcting mistakes. Therefore, we must properly use the weapon of criticism and self-criticism, and help comrades with a frank and sincere attitude. We criticize in order to help comrades progress, not to attack individuals.

　　批评与帮助
    柯枫
    有一位参加工作不久的同志，各方面的修养都比较差，因此，周围的人对他有些轻视的态度，于是影响了团结。在大会上，大家严厉的批评了他一顿，弄得他感情上无法接受，会议无结果而散，没有收到应有的效果，后来还是经过几次个别谈话，使他在思想上认识了自己的缺点，最后又举行了一个互相检讨、批评的会议，才解决了问题。
    从这件事情里，使我们认识到，同志们在一起工作，应有真诚团结的态度，为着巩固团结保证工作的顺利进行，也必须有相互检讨、相互批评和自我批评。对于新参加工作的同志，应多方的关心，多方的帮助，发现了毛病，应及时提出，予以帮助改正，不要堆在一起算总帐。如果犯了较严重的错误，应该是多方的启发他作检讨，帮助他分析错误的性质原因，真正的从思想上去解决问题，使他感觉同志对他关切和帮助，这样更能使他易于接受和改正错误。若是一犯错误就生硬的进行大会批评，思想上并不能解决问题，有时反而发生相反的效果。
    任何一个同志，都不可能不犯错误，问题是如何勇于认识和改正错误。因之，我们要恰当地运用批评与自我批评的武器，以坦白诚恳的态度去帮助同志，我们是为了帮助同志进步而批评，不是为了打击个人而批评。
