Xinhua News Agency, New York: TASS reports that the Chairman of the National Committee of the Communist Party of America, Foster, and the General Secretary, Dennis, each issued statements to the press regarding the release on bail of the American Communist leaders.

　　Foster stated in his statement: "The release of the eleven Communist leaders is the first proof that the people are increasingly aware of the fascist threat. The American people have not been intimidated by the thought control verdict of Foley Square. Judge Medina attempted to abolish the constitutional right to bail, and the release of the eleven leaders is a rejection of this shameful attempt. It is also a rejection of the government."

　　Dennis stated: "Our bail is a meaningful, but only partial, victory for the American people. This victory is a prelude to changing the thought control verdict of the Medina court. It is the beginning of the unity of Black and White Americans. This unity is necessary to achieve a greater victory in defending the Bill of Rights, peace and social progress."

　　福斯特但尼斯发表声明
  　指出美共领袖的保释是美国人民的胜利
    【新华社北京六日电】塔斯社纽约讯：美共全国委员会主席福斯特及总书记但尼斯分别向报界发表关于美共领袖保释出狱的声明。
    福斯特在声明中指出：“十一位共产党领袖的获释，第一次证明了人民日益了解到法西斯的威胁。美国人民没有为福莱广场的思想管制的判决所吓倒。法官麦迪纳企图废除宪法上规定的保释权，十一位领袖的获释，就是对于这个可耻企图的拒斥。它也是对政府的拒斥。”
    但尼斯声明称：“我们的保释是美国人民的有意义的、但还只是部分的胜利。这个胜利是改变麦迪纳法庭的思想控制判决的前奏。它是黑种与白种美国人团结的开始。这种团结乃是达成保卫人权法案、和平与社会的进步的更伟大胜利所必需的。”
