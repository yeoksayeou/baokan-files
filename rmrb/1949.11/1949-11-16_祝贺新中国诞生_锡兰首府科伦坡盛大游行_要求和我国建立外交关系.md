Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 15th: Colombo, Ceylon dispatch: On October 9th, under the joint auspices of the Colombo Committee of the Ceylon Communist Party and the Ceylon Federation of Trade Unions, a grand rally was held on Galle Face Green here to celebrate the birth of the People's Republic of China and to condemn the Nehru government of India for its oppression of progressive forces in India.

　　Before the opening of the meeting, workers held a city-wide parade with various banners and portraits of Mao Zedong, Zhu De, and Zhou Enlai. The demonstrators demanded that the Ceylon government immediately establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China, and shouted slogans such as "Chiang Kai-shek's running dogs, get out!" in front of the Kuomintang consulate.

　　The meeting was presided over by Saravanamuttu Natesan. Many people delivered speeches at the meeting, including the General Secretary of the Ceylon Communist Party and Communist members of parliament in the Ceylon Parliament. The meeting unanimously adopted the following two resolutions.

　　(1) Resolution of the meeting congratulating the establishment of the People's Republic of China:

　　“The citizens of Colombo, gathered here, congratulate the glorious victory of the Chinese People's Liberation Army led by the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong—they have liberated China from the rule of American imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries. We excitedly celebrate the founding of the People's Republic of China, which is not only an important step for the liberation of the Chinese people, but also a powerful factor in the worldwide struggle to defend peace, freedom, democracy, and socialism.

　　We demand that the Ceylon government sever all relations with the Kuomintang government and immediately establish diplomatic relations with the new democratic government of the People's Republic of China. The People's Republic of China possesses most of the Chinese territory and the support and trust of the vast majority of the Chinese people, as well as the sympathy of all progressive humanity.

　　We are grateful to the Soviet government and all the people's democratic countries that have established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China.

　　The great victory of the Chinese people has further encouraged us. We are determined to continue the struggle under the leadership of the working class to liberate our country from the rule of British and American imperialism and the reactionary United National Party, so that Ceylon can also join the world democratic and socialist camp led by the Soviet Union."

　　(2) Resolution of the meeting condemning the Nehru government's persecution of progressive forces in India:

　　“The citizens of Colombo, gathered here, condemn the Nehru government's barbaric oppression of the Communist Party of India, the All-India Trade Union Congress, peasant associations, student unions, and other people's democratic organizations. We condemn the Nehru government, which has openly stood on the side of British and American imperialism, opposed the progressive forces in the world, helped the imperialists suppress the liberation movements in the colonies (such as in Malaya), protected the interests of foreign and Indian bourgeoisie, landlords, and aristocrats, while harming the interests of the Indian people, plunging the Indian people into further bankruptcy and crisis; using the army and police to suppress strikes and demonstrations; imprisoning Comrades Dange and Jyoti Basu and thousands of workers, peasants, and student leaders and fighters without trial, and using torture against them; suppressing and closing down several newspapers; and banning and persecuting the Communist Party of India, which leads the struggle of the Indian people. We declare that due to the above crimes, the Nehru government has not only lost the trust and support of the Indian people, but is also despised by progressive people all over the world.

　　The meeting expresses its solidarity with the Communist Party of India, the Indian working class, and the Indian people in opposing the tyranny of the Nehru government, establishing an Indian People's Republic under the leadership of the working class, and moving towards socialism.

　　In the struggle to liberate Ceylon from foreign and United National Party reactionary forces, we declare: The people of Ceylon, under the leadership of the working class, are waging a struggle against the British and American imperialist bloc to defend world peace, freedom, democracy, and socialism.”

　　祝贺新中国诞生
  　锡兰首府科伦坡盛大游行
    要求和我国建立外交关系
    【新华社北京十五日电】锡兰首府科伦坡讯：十月九日，在锡兰共产党科伦坡委员会和锡兰职工会联合会联合主持之下，此间哥尔菲司草地举行了一个盛大的集会，祝贺中华人民共和国的诞生，并斥责印度尼赫鲁政府对印度进步势力所施的压迫。
    在大会开幕之前，工人们曾高举着各种标语牌和毛泽东、朱德、周恩来的像片举行环城大游行。游行者要求锡兰政府立即与中华人民共和国建立外交关系，并且在国民党的领事馆门前高呼“蒋家走狗们滚蛋！”的口号。
    大会由萨拉南加拉·泽罗主持。有许多人在会上发表演讲，其中包括锡兰共产党的总书记和锡兰国会中的共产党议员们。大会一致通过如下的两个决议。
    （一）大会关于祝贺中华人民共和国成立的决议：
    “科伦坡市民们在此集会，祝贺中国共产党和毛泽东同志所领导的中国人民解放军的光辉胜利——他们已经把中国从美国帝国主义和国民党反动派的统治下解放出来。我们兴奋地祝贺中华人民共和国的成立，它不仅是中国人民获得解放的重要步骤，并且是全世界为保卫和平、自由、民主和社会主义的战斗中一个有力的因素。
    我们要求锡兰政府和国民党政府断绝一切关系，并立即和中华人民共和国的新民主主义的政府建立外交关系。中华人民共和国拥有中国土地的大部分和极大多数的中国人民的拥护和信任，以及一切进步人类的同情。
    我们感激苏联政府以及一切已经和中华人民共和国建立邦交的人民民主国家。
    中国人民的伟大胜利更加鼓舞了我们。我们决心在工人阶级领导之下继续进行斗争，把我们的国家从英美帝国主义和统一国民党反动派的统治下解放出来，使锡兰也能参加到由苏联领导的世界民主和社会主义的阵营中来。”
    （二）大会关于斥责尼赫鲁政府迫害印度进步势力的决议：
    “科伦坡市民们在此开会，斥责尼赫鲁政府对于印度共产党、全印职工大会、农民协会、学生联合会和其他人民的民主组织所施的野蛮的压迫。我们斥责尼赫鲁政府，这个政府已经公然站在英美帝国主义的一边，反对世界上的进步力量；帮助帝国主义者镇压殖民地的解放运动（例如在马来亚）；保护外国的和印度的资产阶级、地主们和贵族们的利益，而危害印度人民大众的利益；使印度人民更加陷于破产与危机；使用军队和警察压迫罢工和示威运动；不经审讯而囚禁丹吉和觉凡纳丹同志以及成千的工人、农民、学生的领袖和战士，并对他们使用酷刑；压迫并封闭了几家报纸；以及禁止并迫害领导印度人民大众作斗争的印度共产党。我们宣称：由于以上的种种罪行，尼赫鲁政府非但丧失了印度人民的信任和支持，而且也为全世界进步人士所不齿。
    大会表示和印度共产党、印度工人阶级以及印度人民的团结一致，反对尼赫鲁政府的专制，在工人阶级的领导之下，建立一个印度人民的共和国而走向社会主义。
    在为了把锡兰从国外的和统一国民党的反动势力之下解放出来而进行的斗争中，我们宣言：锡兰人民在工人阶级领导之下，正在进行反对英美帝国主义集团，保卫世界和平、自由、民主和社会主义的斗争。”
