How Fei Xiulan Learned Three Hundred Characters
　　Xu Zhongmin
    Fei Xiulan is a seventeen-year-old lathe operator in the Jinan Inspection Section. She entered the machine shop in August to learn lathe work. After more than a month of her own efforts, and with the enthusiastic help of her master and comrades, she can now operate the machine herself to do drilling work. She was originally a girl who did not know a single character. Due to the pressure of life, she had no opportunity to go to school. Therefore, she felt distressed when she entered the factory. Every piece of work, picking up a small part, has dimensions, fractions of a point, and without arithmetic, it is very troublesome. In September, she listened to several CYCL reports and understood that the CYCL is a good school for learning technology, culture, and politics, so she applied to join the CYCL.
    One day at the end of September, I asked her: "Xiao Fei, how do you feel after joining the CYCL for more than a month?" She just smiled. I asked again: "How is your study? How many new characters have you learned!" She still smiled, and after a long time said: "I don't know? Who knows how many I've learned?" She really didn't know how many she had learned. How did she learn? When you enter her machine shop, as long as she is not busy working, you can see her scribbling on the floor or iron plate, learning to write characters or calculating 1/16, 3/8, 1/4. A seventeen-year-old female worker who just entered the factory, seeing the complex machine - the lathe - initially really understood nothing; but Xiao Fei just likes to ask questions, and if she doesn't understand, she asks others to teach her, and humbly learns from the master and comrades. When eating, if there is nothing to do after putting down the rice bowl, you can see her taking out her literacy book and studying. Usually after get off work, she carries a small package, which contains a scratch paper and a new character book, which looks very much like a cultural person carrying a document bag. Opening her notebook, the first line is 12345... below are many formulas, addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, units, tens, and hundreds. Opening her other notebook, there are a few very clear characters inside, and a piece of crooked identical characters that are not in rows or columns. Obviously, this is Xiao Fei asking someone to write her very clear characters, and she learned to write many times in the notebook. Every night, she and several female workers study culture and arithmetic together at the CYCL branch. Other comrades sometimes can't persevere, but she insists on staying until about ten o'clock every day before going home to rest. She actively participates in every collective study in the factory, including politics, culture, and technology, without lagging behind.
    Xiao Fei studied so actively for more than a month and learned a lot of new characters. When studying on the evening of the 28th, I asked her: "Xiao Fei, how many characters have you learned in this month?" She still couldn't say. I said to her in a tone of examining her achievements: "Tonight, you silently write out all the characters you have learned one by one without looking at the book, and count how many you write." The next day, she handed me three pages of silently written characters. I counted them one by one in front of her, a full three hundred characters. After I finished checking, I saw that there were two misspelled characters, so I told her. She asked me to write them out for her again, and she asked me: "How many are there? Are there a hundred?" I said: "Exactly three hundred." She said in surprise: "Wow! Three hundred! I didn't feel like I learned a few." She also said: "There are some I learned but can't write, but I can recognize them when I see them." (Reprinted from People's Railway News)

　　费秀兰怎样学会了三百个字
　　徐中民
    费秀兰，是济南检车段的十七岁镟床女工，她在八月里进了机器房，学习作镟工。经过自己一个多月的努力，师傅和同志们的热心帮助，现在已经自己可以开动机器作打眼（钻眼）工作。她原是一个大字都不识的女孩子，由于生活所迫没有上学的机会，因此她进了工厂就感到了苦恼，每一件工作，拿起一个小零件，都是有分寸的，都是几分之几的，不会算术，多苦恼。九月里，她听了几次建团报告，了解了青年团是学习技术、文化、政治的好学校，因此她便申请入了团。
    九月底有一天我问她：“小费入团一个多月感觉怎么样？”她只是笑。我又问：“你学习怎样？学会了多少个生字！”她还是笑，半天说了一句：“俺不知道？谁知学了有多少？”学习了有多少，她自己真不知道的，她是怎样学习的呢？进了她的那个机器房里，只要她不在忙着工作，就可以看见她在地板上，或铁板上乱画学习写字或１／１６、３／８、１／４的算着。十七岁才进厂的女工，见了复杂的机器——镟床，起初真是什么都不懂；可是小费就是好问，不懂就叫别人教她，很虚心的向师傅向同志们学习。吃饭时放下饭碗没有事了，就看见她拿出识字本学习开了。平时下了班，她夹着个小包袱，里面有一个算草本子，一个生字本子，看来很象一个文化人拿的文件包。打开他的本子一看，头一行就是１２３４５……下边便是许多算式，加减乘除，单位、十位、百位的都有。打开她的另一个本子一看，里边有几个很清楚的字，和一片不成行不成趟的弯弯曲曲的相同的字，很显然，这是小费叫别人给她写下了很清楚的字，她又在本子上学着写了很多遍。她每天晚上同几个女工，一块在团支部学习文化，算术。其他同志有时坚持不下去，但她每天都要坚持到十点钟左右才回家休息。厂里的政治、文化、技术等集体学习，她每次都不落后的积极参加。
    小费就这样积极的学习了一个多月，学会了很多的生字。二十八日晚上学习时我问她：“小费你这一个多月学会了有多少字？”她还是说不出来，我就以要考试她的成绩的态度对她说：“今晚上你把所学的字一个一个不看本子都默写出，默写几个算几个。”第二天她交给我默写出来的三张，我当她面一个一个数了一遍，整整三百个字，我查完后，看见有两个错字，我就告诉了她，她叫我给她另写出，她问我：“有多少个？有一百个没有？”我说：“整三百个。”她很吃惊的说：“呀！三百个！我觉得没学几个似的。”她又说：“还有些学过了写不上来了，看见也能认得。”（转载自人民铁道报）
