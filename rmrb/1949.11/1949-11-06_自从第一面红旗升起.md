　　Since the First Red Flag Was Raised
    Yan Chen
    Since the first red flag
    Was raised high above the Kremlin,
    The world has changed its old
    Appearance,
    Life has begun to have new meaning.
    The sun is no longer as indifferent as before,
    —It illuminates our path forward;
    The night is not as terrifying as in the past,
    —What terrifies them,
    Are those vampires and warmongers,
    Who toss and turn every night,
    And shudder even in the heat of summer.
　
    Since the first red flag
    Was raised high above the Kremlin,
    The whistle of the steam engine is no longer a sound of pain;
    It brings the consciousness and glory of labor,
    Machines, whirl as quickly as possible,
    Stakhanovites, every second is an attack.
    Those green, vast, and boundless farms,
    Where the blood and sweat of our ancestors flowed,
    Harvests have driven away famine,
    Tractors have replaced wooden plows,
    The songs of club evening parties are loud and clear,
    Where have those simple little thatched huts gone!
　
    Since the first red flag
    Was raised high above the Kremlin,
    Siberia is no longer a desolate wilderness,
    Prosperous cities are being built one after another,
    There are human footprints in the Arctic Circle,
    The desert can be turned into fertile land.
    This is not some mysterious miracle,
    It is created by the wisdom of the proletariat,
    Nothing is impossible to succeed,
    We must rewrite the history of mankind from the beginning.
　
    Since the first red flag
    Was raised high above the Kremlin,
    Democracy and freedom are no longer extravagant fantasies,
    A good life is not a long night's dream,
    Wearing the flowers of happiness are not others,
    It is precisely ourselves, the working people.
    Are you jealous? Do you want to destroy it?
    Fourteen countries once fell outside the iron gate,
    Hitler went mad for a while,
    But, in the end, who won the final victory?
　
    Since the first red flag
    Was raised high above the Kremlin,
    Ancient China, oh,
    Has also been illuminated to be young and awakened,
    The sleeping one, rises up, the kind one, fights!
    We are finally proud
    To join the ranks of the great October Revolution.
    Red flags wave side by side above our heads,
    Weapons are carried side by side on our shoulders,
    The new world is tightly grasped in our own hands!

　　自从第一面红旗升起
    严辰
    自从第一面红旗
    在克里姆宫高高升
    起，
    世界改变了她陈旧
    的面貌，
    生活开始有了新的意义。
    太阳不再先前那样漠不关心，
    ——她照亮了我们前进的路；
    黑夜也不如过去的恐怖，
    ——恐怖的是他们，
    是那些吸血鬼和战争贩子，
    他们每晚上辗转反侧，
    大热天也会起一阵颤栗。
　
    自从第一面红旗
    在克里姆宫高高升起，
    汽笛的叫唤不再是痛苦；
    它带来了劳动的自觉和光荣，
    机器呵，尽快尽快的转动，
    斯泰哈诺夫们，每一秒钟都在突
    击。
    那流尽了先人的血汗的
    绿油油的广阔无边的农场，
    丰收赶走了荒歉，
    拖拉机代替了木犁，
    俱乐部晚会的歌声嘹亮，
    那些简陋的小茅屋去了那里！
　
    自从第一面红旗
    在克里姆宫高高升起，
    西伯利亚不再是万里荒原，
    繁荣的城市在一座座建立，
    北极圈里有了人的脚迹，
    沙漠能变成肥沃的土地。
    这不是什么神秘的奇迹，
    这是无产阶级的智慧所创造，
    没有一件事情不可能成功，
    人类的历史我们要从头写起。
　
    自从第一面红旗
    在克里姆林宫高高升起，
    民主自由不再是奢侈的幻想，
    美好的生活不是长夜的梦呓，
    戴着幸福的花朵的，不是别人，
    正是我们劳动人民自己。
    你们妒忌吗？你们想破坏吗？
    十四个国家曾经在铁门外栽倒，
    希特勒疯狂过一时，
    可是，终究是谁赢得了最后的胜利
    ？
　
    自从第一面红旗
    在克里姆林宫高高升起，
    古老的中国呵，
    也被照映得年轻清醒，
    沉睡的、奋起，善良的、战斗！
    我们终于骄傲的
    走进了伟大的十月的行列。
    红旗相并的招展在我们头顶，
    武器相并的扛在我们肩膀，
    新世界正紧紧地掌握在我们自己手
    里！
