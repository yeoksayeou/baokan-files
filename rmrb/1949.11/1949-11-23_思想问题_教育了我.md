　　"Ideological Problems" Educated Me
　　Lǚ Qīnghuán, Municipal No. 5 Middle School

The third major lesson of the Beijing Municipal Middle School Teachers and Students Political Training Class was watching the "Ideological Problems" performed by the North China University Third Literary Troupe. This play greatly educated me:

First, "Ideological Problems" told me that young people can all be reformed. We teachers, in particular, should correctly recognize this point. But bourgeois education does not see it this way. They believe that good students and bad students are essentially different, and that bad students cannot be reformed.

Recently, I made such a mistake: There is a well-known backward student in my class. He has repeated grades three times, doesn't bring his book bag to class, doesn't take notes, is late, skips class, and doesn't participate in group life... When classmates give him advice, he not only doesn't accept it, but also finds fault with and attacks the classmates who criticize him. I have talked to him individually many times, but he has never changed, which has disappointed me greatly! Recently, the school launched a red flag competition, and all the students in the class said to me: With him in this class, we will definitely not get the red flag. So my thoughts became even more confused. I thought: "What hope is there for such a student? I might as well ask the school to expel him." But "Ideological Problems" told me that this idea was wrong. I deeply examined myself and realized that this student was not without any progress at all, but that I had made the same "acute illness" as the group leader Li Zhenwei in the play, and was blinded by the idea that "bad students cannot be reformed." "Ideological Problems" not only solved an ideological problem for me, but also gave me infinite courage and determination. I will patiently understand him, help him, and reform him. Captain Zhao said it well: "No matter what he is like, according to Marxism-Leninism, he can be reformed."

Second, "Ideological Problems" told me what correct leadership methods are. For example, if we teachers who are class directors want to run the class we lead well, we must start from serving the students and from the interests of the students. Go deep into the students, understand the specific situation of each student, and patiently educate and help them. Avoid starting from subjective wishes. The group leader Li Zhenwei in "Ideological Problems" is exactly like this. He is divorced from the masses, does not understand the students' situation, is subjectively impatient, and throws labels everywhere. The more he wants to stand out and show his face and run his group well, the more the facts are contrary to what he thinks. We must take this as a warning!

Third, "Ideological Problems" told me that all bad ideologies and work styles are inseparable from the institutions and traditions of the old society. When we see the petty clerk Yu Zhirang's restrained and humble appearance, we find it ridiculous, even disgusting. But "Ideological Problems" gave us a powerful explanation: Yu Zhirang's vulgar and hypocritical attitude towards life is entirely "bestowed" by the ruling class of the old society. He has no backing, and unemployment and poverty constantly threaten him, so in his thinking he can only "take a step back in everything," and has developed a humble and slippery style. Listen to his accusation: When he was "full of vigor," didn't he also fight the son of the principal for injustice and get expelled?

Thinking back to the past, under the feet of the Kuomintang secret agent principal, for the sake of the food and clothing of our wives and children, weren't we also more or less like Yu Zhirang, vulgar and worldly, humble and humiliated? Today, we are liberated. All this was brought to us by the great people's leader Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party he led. Therefore, we must strive to study the Marxist-Leninist stance, viewpoints, and methods, study Mao Zedong Thought, analyze the things around us, and for the various bad ideologies and work styles that exist among students, we must carefully find out its roots and responsibly and patiently help the students remove them, instead of simply thinking that "a child is unteachable" and only liking to teach good students.

### “思想问题”教育了我

　　“思想问题”教育了我
    市立五中　吕清寰
    北京市中小学教员学生政治训练班的第三次大课，是看华北大学第三文工团演出的“思想问题”。这个戏给了我很大的教育：
    第一，“思想问题”告诉了我：青年都是可以改造的。我们做教师的尤其应该正确地认识到这一点。但是资产阶级的教育却不这样看法。他们认为好学生和坏学生是有着本质的不同，以为坏学生是不可以改造的。
    最近我便犯了这样的错误：我班有一个著名的落后学生，他曾留了三次级，上课不带书包，不抄笔记；迟到，逃堂，不参加小组生活……。同学给他提意见，他不仅不接受，反倒找碴儿打击批评他的同学。我个别和他谈过多少次话，他一直不改，使我很失望！最近学校展开红旗竞赛，全班同学都向我说：这一班有了他，就一定不能得到红旗。于是我的思想更混乱了，我曾想：“这样的学生还有什么希望，干脆找学校开除他算了。”但是“思想问题”告诉我这种想法是错了。我深刻地检讨了自己，才发现这个学生并不是一点进步都没有，只是我犯了剧中的小组长李震威的“急性病”，和让“坏学生不能改造”的思想蒙住了眼睛。“思想问题”不但给我解决了一个思想问题，更给了我无限的勇气和决心，我要耐心地了解他，帮助他，改造他。队长赵大姐说的好：“管他怎样呢？根据马列主义都是可以改造的。”
    第二，“思想问题”告诉了我：什么是正确的领导方法。比如我们做级任的教师，要把自己所领导的班搞好，那就一定要从为同学服务，为同学的利益出发。深入到学生中去，了解每一个同学具体情况，耐心地教育和帮助。切忌从主观愿望出发。“思想问题”中的小组长李震威正是这样，脱离群众，不了解同学情况，主观急躁，帽子满天飞，他越想出头露脸把自己领导的小组搞好，事实越是与他所想的背道而驰。我们要引为警惕！
    第三，“思想问题”告诉了我：一切坏的思想作风和旧社会的制度传统是分不开的。看小职员余志让那付拘谨而卑微的样子，我们觉得可笑，甚至是厌恶。但“思想问题”却给我们作了有力的解说：余志让的庸俗虚伪的处世态度，完全是旧社会统治阶级的“赐予”。他没有靠山，失业和贫困时时威胁着他，所以在思想上只有“遇事做退一步想”，而养成了卑躬油滑的作风。你听他的控诉：在“血气方刚”的时候，不是也做过因不平打了校长的儿子而被开除的斗争吗？
    回想我们过去在国民党特务校长的脚下，为了妻儿老小的衣食，不是也或多或少和余志让一样的庸俗世故，卑躬屈辱吗？今天，我们解放了。这都是伟大的人民领袖毛主席，及其所领导的中国共产党给我们带来的。所以我们一定要努力学习马列主义立场，观点，方法，学习毛泽东思想，分析周围的事物，对于学生当中存在的各种各样的不好的思想作风，我们要细心地找出它的根源，负责地，耐心地帮助同学们去掉，而不应简单地认为“孺子不可教”，而只喜欢教好的学生。
