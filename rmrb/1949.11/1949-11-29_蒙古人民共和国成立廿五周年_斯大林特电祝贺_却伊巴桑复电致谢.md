(1) Stalin's telegram of congratulations to Marshal Choibalsan:

    On the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the proclamation of the Mongolian People's Republic, I extend my congratulations on behalf of the Soviet government and myself, to you and through you to the friendly Mongolian people. For many years, the Mongolian people have eliminated the legacy of the old era—centuries of backwardness—with diligent labor, and have achieved great achievements in improving the welfare and culture of their country.

    I wish the friendly Mongolian people and their government further success in economic and cultural construction.

    Stalin (signed)

(2) Marshal Choibalsan's reply to Stalin:

    On behalf of the Mongolian people, the government of the Mongolian People's Republic, and myself, I sincerely thank you and, through you, the Soviet government for your friendly congratulations on the 25th anniversary of the founding of the Mongolian People's Republic.

    The great October Revolution and the invincible doctrine of Lenin and Stalin have opened up a bright path of freedom and happiness for the Mongolian people. Because of this, in the past twenty-five years of the existence of the Mongolian People's Republic, our people have been able to achieve great achievements in overcoming feudal remnants and developing the economy and culture of their country.

    The Mongolian people are able to obtain freedom and independence, and can have all these achievements in the economic and cultural construction of our country, which should be attributed to the multifaceted and selfless assistance of the great Soviet people, the eternal friendship between our two peoples that has withstood all tests, and you—the Mongolian people's dear friend and mentor.

    I would like to express, to you, and through you to the Soviet government and the great Soviet people, the sincere gratitude of all the Mongolian people for your support and assistance in the development of the Mongolian People's Republic, and wish you health and longevity for the benefit and happiness of the working people of the world.

    Marshal Choibalsan, Prime Minister of the Mongolian People's Republic (signed)
