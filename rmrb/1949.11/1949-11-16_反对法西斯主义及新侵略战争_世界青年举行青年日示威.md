　　Against Fascism and New Wars of Aggression
　　World Youth Hold Youth Day Demonstrations
    At the same time, democratic youth around the world are enthusiastically celebrating World Youth Day on November 10th, and World Student Week from November 10th to 17th. These two major commemorative festivals are days for democratic youth and students around the world to unite and fight for peace, democracy, national independence, and a bright future for youth. Various gatherings commemorating World Youth Day were enthusiastically held in various countries such as the Soviet Union, China, Poland, Bulgaria, and Hungary. Before the commemorative festival, the World Federation of Democratic Youth called on democratic students around the world to launch demonstrations during World Student Week to express their determination to resist fascism and new wars of aggression. The Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League, together with two other national youth and student organizations, also issued a notice on celebrating the two major commemorative festivals, stipulating November 10th to 17th as the publicity week for World Youth Day and World Student Week; calling on the vast number of young people to expand the influence of the World Federation of Democratic Youth and the International Union of Students, strengthen internationalist education, unite young people all over the world, and fight for lasting peace, democracy, national independence, and a better future.
    At the same time as the US imperialist policy of aggression is suffering serious setbacks, signs of the beginning of the economic crisis in the United States are becoming increasingly apparent. From October 1948 to October 1949, US industrial production had fallen by 22 percent, exceeding the level of 15 percent in the first year of the economic crisis of 1929-33. According to the New York Herald Tribune, the US industrial production index for the week ending October 29th had fallen by 38 percent compared with the same week last year. This sharp decline in industrial production in the United States is the result of the shrinking domestic and foreign markets, which has made it necessary to implement large-scale production cuts. Despite the various measures taken by the reactionary US government to expand foreign aggression, foreign exports continue to decline sharply. According to statistics from the US Department of Commerce, exports in September this year were 19 percent lower than the average monthly exports in the first half of this year. Accompanied by massive reductions in production, the number of unemployed has increased significantly. According to official US statistics, the number of fully unemployed in the United States has doubled in the past year, and the number of fully and semi-unemployed has exceeded 14 million. In this smog-filled situation, US imperialists are frantically taking emergency measures, attempting to save their bankrupt aggression plans and the increasingly obvious economic crisis. First, the reactionary United States launched a new offensive against Western European Marshall Plan countries, attempting to seize all sovereignty of these countries in order to completely turn these countries into colonial markets of the United States. This new offensive was launched by Hoffman, the executor of the "Marshall Plan," who, at the meeting of the Council of the so-called "European Economic Cooperation Organization" of 19 countries held in Paris from October 31 to November 2, presented the Western European countries with the "ultimatum," demanding that these countries abolish tariff barriers and financial devaluation, etc., in order to implement "economic integration" and a "single European market." Second, in addition to constantly holding meetings to discuss anti-people countermeasures, the reactionary United States is also intensifying its shameful fifth column secret activities. Following the meeting of US envoys to Eastern Europe in London at the end of October to discuss new strategies to strengthen espionage activities against the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries, the US State Department recently instructed its embassies in Southeast European countries to strengthen activities against the governments of these countries and give them specific instructions on "new methods of propaganda."

### 反对法西斯主义及新侵略战争　世界青年举行青年日示威

　　反对法西斯主义及新侵略战争
  　世界青年举行青年日示威
    与此同时，世界民主青年热烈庆祝十一月十日的世界青年日，和十一月十日至十七日的世界学生周。这两大纪念节乃是世界民主青年和学生团结起来为和平、民主、各民族独立和青年美好将来而斗争的日子。纪念世界青年日的各种集会，在苏、中、波、保、匈等国各地热烈进行。在纪念节前，世界民主学生联合会号召在世界学生周中，发动全世界民主学生举行示威，表示抵抗法西斯主义与新侵略战争的决心。中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会同其他两个全国性青年学生团体，也发表了关于庆祝两大纪念节的通知，规定十一月十日到十七日为世界青年日和世界学生周的宣传周；号召在这一宣传周中，在广大青年中扩大世界民主青年联盟和国际民主学生联合会的影响，加强国际主义教育，团结全世界青年，为持久和平、民主、各民族的独立及更好的将来而斗争。
    与美帝国主义侵略政策遭受严重失败的同时，美国的经济危机开始的征候正日益显著。从一九四八年十月到一九四九年十月，美国工业产量已下降了百分之二十二，这已超过了一九二九年——三三年经济危机第一年下降百分之十五的水平。据纽约先驱论坛报透露，美国工业生产指数在截至十月二十九日为止的一周中，与去年同周相比，已下降了百分之三十八。美国这种工业生产的猛烈下跌，乃是国内外市场日趋缩小，因而不得不实行大量减产的结果。尽管美国反动政府采取了各种扩大对外侵略的措施，但对外输出仍不断锐减。据美商务部统计，今年九月份的出口额，较今年上半年每月平均出口额低达百分之十九。伴随着大量缩减生产而来的，失业人数大为增加。据美官方统计，美国过去一年全失业者已猛增一倍，全失业与半失业者已超过一千四百万人。在这种满布阻霾的情况下，美帝国主义者慌忙地采取紧急措施，妄图挽救其到处破产的侵略计划，和日益显露的经济危机。第一、美国反动派向西欧马歇尔化国家发动了新攻势，企图攫夺这些国家的全部主权，以便把这些国家完全变成美国的殖民地市场。这一新攻势是由“马歇尔计划”执行人霍夫曼发动的，他在十月三十一日至十一月二日在巴黎召开的所谓“欧洲经合总署”十九国理事会会议上，向西欧各国提出了“哀的美敦书”，要求这些国家废除关税壁垒和金融贬值等，以实行“经济的整体化”和“单一的欧洲市场”。第二、美国反动派除了不断举行会议，商讨反人民的对策外，并正在加紧其可耻的第五纵队的秘密活动。继美国驻东欧使节十月底在伦敦举行会议，商讨加强对苏联和人民民主国家特务活动的新策略以后，美国务院近又指令其在东南欧各国的使馆，加强反对这些国家政府的活动，并给予他们关于“宣传的新方法”的具体指示。
