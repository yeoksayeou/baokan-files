    On the National Flag, National Anthem, and Era Name

    I. Why is the surface of the national flag of the People’s Republic of China red? What do the five five-pointed stars on the flag represent? Why are the stars yellow? Why does one point of each of the four smaller five-pointed stars point directly at the center of the larger five-pointed star?

    Answer: The red color of the national flag of the People's Republic of China symbolizes revolution. The five five-pointed stars and their interrelationship symbolize the great unity of the revolutionary people under the leadership of the Communist Party. The stars are yellow to show brightness on the red background. Yellow is brighter and more beautiful than white. Each of the four smaller five-pointed stars has one point pointing directly at the center of the larger star. This indicates unity around one center, and it also appears compact and aesthetically pleasing in form.

    II. Why is the flagpole sleeve of the national flag white?

    Answer: The flagpole sleeve of the national flag is white to distinguish it from the red of the flag surface. The length and height of the flag surface are fixed at a ratio of three to two, while the width of the flagpole sleeve is determined according to needs. In order to avoid affecting the style of the flag surface, the color of the flagpole sleeve must be different from the color of the flag surface.

    III. Why is the "March of the Volunteers" adopted as the current national anthem of the People's Republic of China? Why aren't some of the lyrics that are inconsistent with the current situation modified?

    Answer: The "March of the Volunteers" has been the most popular song in the revolutionary struggles of the broad masses of the Chinese people for more than a decade and already has historical significance. Adopting the "March of the Volunteers" as the current national anthem of the People's Republic of China without modification is to evoke the people's recollection of the hardships and worries in the process of creating the motherland, to encourage the people to carry forward the patriotic enthusiasm to resist imperialist aggression, and to carry the revolution through to the end. This is the same as the role of the "Internationale" as the national anthem of the Soviet people for a long period of time, and the "Marseillaise" as the national anthem of the French people today.

    IV. What is the significance of the People's Republic of China adopting the Gregorian calendar for dating? Since the Gregorian calendar originates from the birth of Jesus Christ, does our use of this era name have religious implications?

    Answer: The establishment of the People's Republic of China is an epoch-making major change in Chinese history, completely different from the nominal Republic of China, so it is not appropriate to continue to use the era name of the Republic of China. However, it is also not appropriate to use a method of dating that is different from that of other countries in the world. The Gregorian calendar is a dating method commonly used by the vast majority of countries in the world, not exclusively by Christian countries, so there is no religious implication in adopting the Gregorian calendar for convenience.

    关于国旗国歌和年号
    一、中华人民共和国国旗的旗面为什么是红色的？旗上的五颗五角星代表什么？为什么星是黄色的？四颗小五角星为什么有一尖正对着大五角星的中心点？
    答：中华人民共和国国旗旗面的红色象征革命。旗上的五颗五角星及其相互关系象征共产党领导下的革命人民大团结。星用黄色是为着在红地上显出光明，黄色较白色明亮美丽，四颗小五角星各有一尖正对着大星的中心点，这是表示围绕着一个中心而团结，在形式上也显得紧凑美观。
    二、为什么国旗的旗杆套用白色？
    答：国旗的旗杆套用白色是为了与旗面的红色相区别。旗面的长和高是固定的三与二之比，而旗杆套的宽窄却是根据需要来决定的，为了避免影响旗面的式样，必须使旗杆套的颜色区别于旗面的颜色。
    三、为什么采用义勇军进行曲为中华人民共和国现时的国歌？其中有些词句不符合于目前情况者为什么不修改？
    答：义勇军进行曲是十余年来在中国广大人民的革命斗争中最流行的歌曲，已经具有历史意义。采用义勇军进行曲为中华人民共和国现时的国歌而不加修改，是为了唤起人民回想祖国创造过程中的艰难忧患，鼓舞人民发扬反抗帝国主义侵略的爱国热情，把革命进行到底。这与苏联人民曾在长期间以国际歌为国歌，法国人民今天仍以马赛曲为国歌的作用是一样的。
    四、中华人民共和国纪年采用公元的意义如何？公元纪年是由耶稣基督的降生而来，我们沿用这年号是否有宗教意味？
    答：中华人民共和国的成立在中国历史上是一个划时代的大变革，与中华民国的有名无实完全不同，所以不宜沿用中华民国的纪元。但也不宜再用一种与世界其他各国都不相同的纪年方法。公元是全世界绝大多数国家所公用的纪年方法，并不是基督教国家所独用的，所以为了便利采用公元，并无宗教意味。
