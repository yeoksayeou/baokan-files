Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 17th. Louis Saillant, Secretary-General of the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), delivered a report today at the Second Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference entitled "The Activities of the WFTU in Asian and Australian Countries and Its Tasks." In his report, Saillant first stated: "Entrusted by the Second Congress of the WFTU, the Executive Bureau of the WFTU, in the name of the WFTU's 72 million members, pays tribute to the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference and expresses its concern and unwavering friendship to the working people of Asian and Australian countries. We are extremely pleased to be meeting today in the capital of People's Democratic China. The Chinese people have created the new People's Republic of China, which has completely transformed the political and social landscape of the world. Hundreds of millions of people worldwide see the victory of the Chinese people as a clear defeat for international reactionaries and a major success for human progress. In the name of the WFTU, we extend our deep respect to Comrade Mao Zedong, who leads the Chinese people's cause of liberation."

Saillant's report also pointed out: This Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference can be said to be one of the most important and positive actions since the establishment of the WFTU in 1945, and it is a great victory for the world working class under the leadership of the WFTU.

He then cited many facts to illustrate that the WFTU has consistently stood on the side of the democratic and peaceful camp, striving for the liberation of the working class and world democratic peace; at the same time, it has always actively taken various actions to support the struggle of the working class in Asian and Australian countries against imperialism and feudal forces.

Regarding the tasks of this conference, Saillant pointed out in his report: First, to listen to reports on the work of trade unions in Asian and Australian countries; to study the political and social activities of workers in Asian and Australian countries; and, based on the decisions of the WFTU, to study how to establish a permanent organization in China that can regularly contact Asian and Far Eastern countries; and how to lead the workers' movement in Asia and Australia. He said: This conference will play a very important and decisive role in the development of trade unions in Asian and Australian countries, enabling the working class to unite and fight for social progress, economic development, and world democratic peace.
