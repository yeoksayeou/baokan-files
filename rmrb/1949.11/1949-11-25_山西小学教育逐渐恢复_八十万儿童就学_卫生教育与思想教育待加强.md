　　【Taiyuan News】Shanxi Province's primary education work has achieved results after a year of recovery and rectification. According to surveys: the old liberated areas have reversed the past tendency of not focusing on cultural learning, while the new liberated areas have rapidly destroyed the reactionary education system of the Chiang Kai-shek/Yan Xishan clique, adopted new textbooks, and adopted methods such as rotational training and intensive training to train and transform a large number of old teachers. Schools and students have increased significantly. In the Fenyang Special District's seven counties, the number of elementary and complete primary schools increased from 886 in early February of this year to 1,020 in October, an increase of 134 schools; the number of students increased from 54,119 to 73,097, an increase of 18,978 students. Comparing the period before the summer vacation with October this year in Taiyuan City, the number of junior primary schools increased by 20, and the number of complete primary schools increased by 7, with an increase of 3,034 students. The above achievements have created favorable conditions and a necessary foundation for the future implementation of universal education throughout the province and for improving primary education one step further on the current basis. There are currently 16,704 junior primary schools and 425 senior primary schools in the province, with a total of 860,313 children enrolled in school.

    However, on the other hand, due to the objective situation of the new policy beginning to be implemented and the merger of various regions in the province, and due to the different work foundations and the level of understanding of educational workers in various regions in the past (Taihang, Taiyue, Jinzhong, Jinxi, Jin Southwest), the implementation of the new primary education policy is not clear enough and not complete enough. For example, primary education has made great achievements in cultivating children's basic abilities in reading, writing, and arithmetic, and in improving culture, but not enough attention has been paid to "paying attention to health and hygiene education, and cultivating children's healthy bodies" and "cultivating children's love for the people and the country, and good habits of loving labor, democracy, and discipline"; therefore, in some schools, there has been a purely cultural bias, neglecting the healthy physical and mental development and ideological education of children. In the implementation of the new formal system, some education workers (mainly old teachers) believe that regularization must inherit the old education system of the past, some believe that only "full-day system" is regularization, and some only focus on formal aspects and equipment. In the combination of cultural education and political and ideological education, there is a lack of unified understanding, such as thinking that political education cannot be carried out in primary education, and political textbooks must be compiled separately, without knowing that the content of primary school Chinese, history, geography, and other courses are selected according to new political content and new viewpoints.

    In addition, the proportion of out-of-school children is still relatively large, and the quality and quantity of teachers cannot meet the needs of the current work. The total number of school-age children, male and female, in the province is 1,835,699, and the number of children in school is 860,313, accounting for 46.87% of school-age children; the number of out-of-school children is 975,386, accounting for 53.13% of school-age children. In terms of teachers, there are 21,347 junior primary school teachers and 2,309 senior primary school teachers in the province, a total of 23,656 teachers. According to the province's universal education plan, another 30,000 primary and junior primary school teachers are needed; secondly, the quality of existing teachers is not high, and unqualified teachers account for about one-third; therefore, mobilizing out-of-school children to attend school, training teachers, strengthening the political and professional learning of in-service teachers, and uniting and transforming a large number of old intellectuals in urban and rural areas to serve the new democratic education are still arduous tasks for a considerable period of time to come.

　　山西小学教育逐渐恢复
　　八十万儿童就学
　　卫生教育与思想教育待加强
    【太原讯】山西省小学教育工作经一年来的恢复与整顿，已获得成绩。据调查：老区已扭转了过去不以文化学习为主的偏向，新区则迅速摧毁了蒋阎匪的反动教育制度，采用了新的课本，采取轮训、集训等办法，训练与改造了大批旧教员，学校及学生有显著增加，汾阳专区七个县，今年二月初小及完小共有八百八十六座，十月份已达一千零二十座，增加一百三十四座；学生由五万四千一百一十九人增至七万三千零九十七名，增加学生一万八千九百七十八人。太原市今年暑假前与十月份比较，即增加了初小二十座、完小七座，增加学生三千零三十四人。上述成绩，为今后全省实施普及教育并在现在基础上把小学教育提高一步，创造了有利条件与必要的基础。全省现有初小一万六千七百零四座，高小四百二十五座，共有八十六万零三百一十三个儿童入校学习。
    但是，另一方面，由于新的方针开始贯彻及全省各个地区开始合并为一的客观情况，由于过去各个地区（太行、太岳、晋中、晋西、晋西南）的工作基础及教育工作者的认识水平不一，对于新的小学教育的实施方针是体现的不够明确与不够完整的。如小学教育中在培养儿童的读写算的基本能力，提高文化方面，各地有很大成绩，但对"注意卫生健康教育，培养儿童健康身体"，"培养儿童爱护人民国家的思想及爱好劳动、民主、守纪律的良好习惯"则注意的不够；因而在一些学校中曾发生了单纯文化的偏向，忽视儿童的身心健全发展与思想教育。在实施新型的正规制度上，有些教育工作者（主要是旧教员）认为正规化就必须因袭过去一套旧的教育制度，有的人以为只有"整日制"才是正规化，更有的则只从形式上、设备上讲求正规。在进行文化教育与政治思想教育的结合上，缺乏统一一致的认识，如认为小学教育中不能进行政治教育，必须另编政治课本，而不知小学的国语、史地等课程的内容，就是根据新的政治内容与新的观点进行选择的。
    此外，失学儿童仍占相当大的比重，教师的质量与数量均不能适应目前工作的需要。全省学龄儿童男女共一百八十三万五千六百九十九人，入学儿童共八十六万零三百一十三人，占学龄儿童百分之四十六点八七；失学儿童共九十七万五千三百八十六人，占学龄儿童百分之五十三点一三。师资方面，全省有初小教员二万一千三百四十七人，高小教员二千三百零九人，共二万三千六百五十六人，按照全省普及教育计划尚须高初小教员三万人；其次，现有教员的质量亦不高，不称职的教员约占三分之一强；因此，动员失学儿童就学，培养师资，加强在职教员的政治与业务学习，团结与改造大批城乡旧的知识分子为新民主主义的教育服务，仍是今后相当长时间内的艰巨任务。
