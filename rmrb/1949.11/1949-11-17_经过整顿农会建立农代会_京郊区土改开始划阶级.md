　　After Rectifying the Farmers' Association, Farmers' Representative Conferences Established
  　Land Reform in the Suburbs of Beijing Begins Class Division
    [Beijing News] Land reform in the suburbs of Beijing has entered the stage of class division. Most of the first batch of seventy-three land reform villages have rectified their farmers' associations or established farmers' representative conferences. Due to the widespread mobilization of poor peasants after the land reform, the prestige of the farmers' representative conferences and the class consciousness of the peasants have been raised. Therefore, the general farmers are eager to divide classes. More than fifty villages have now moved to class division. The steps of class division are generally to explain the standards of class division to the masses extensively, then discuss in groups, report themselves, and publicly discuss, and the case is settled after three announcements. Those who are not satisfied can appeal to the court. The suburban farmers are in unprecedented high spirits in learning class division. The speeches at the group meetings are very enthusiastic. They all believe that they must study hard in order to get the yardstick of class division into their own hands. The farmers in Changxindian said: "Class division is a major event, we must study it carefully, so that we can draw a line in front of the landlords in the future." After explaining to the farmers in Wudaomiao, Taiyanggong and other villages in the northern suburbs how to divide the boundary between rich peasants and middle peasants, the middle peasants clarified their own components and felt more at ease.
    When explaining class division, Majiabao Village in the southern suburbs combined it with policy propaganda. When talking about dividing middle peasants, it was linked to the policy of not touching middle peasants; when talking about dividing rich peasants, it was linked to the policy of not touching the self-cultivated part of rich peasants, so that the masses had a deeper understanding of the land reform policy. Luodaozhuang and other villages in the western suburbs combined class division with speaking out about sufferings. When the landlords reported inaccurately or sophistically, the peasants combined it with speaking out about sufferings to reason, which further enhanced the class consciousness of the masses. When dividing classes in Shijingshan, Mentougou and other districts, the feudal part was strictly separated from the transportation industry, and the masses felt it was extremely reasonable. Some deviations also occurred in individual work teams, such as not allowing landlords to attend the meeting, and forcing confessions from landlords and rich peasants when dividing classes. After the Beijing Suburban Committee of the Communist Party of China pointed it out in time, most of them were corrected.

　　经过整顿农会建立农代会
  　京郊区土改开始划阶级
    【北京讯】北京市郊区土地改革已进入划阶级阶段。第一批七十三个土地改革村，大部都整顿了农会或建立农民代表会。由于土地改革后普遍发动贫苦农民，提高了农民代表会的威信和农民的阶级觉悟，因此一般农民都迫切要求划阶级。目前已有五十多个村庄转入划阶级。划阶级的步骤。一般是先广泛向群众说明划阶级的标准，然后小组讨论，自报公议，三榜定案。有不服者可向法院上诉。郊区农民在学习划阶级中，情绪空前高涨，小组会上发言非常热烈，都认为必须好好学习，才能把划阶级的尺子拿到自己手里。长辛店农民说：划阶级是个大事，必须认真学，以后好在地主面前划一划。”北郊五道庙、太阳宫等村向农民解释如何划分富农与中农的界线后，中农搞清了自己的成份，都更安心了。
    在解释划阶级时，南郊马家堡村是结合宣传政策进行的，讲划中农，就联系到不动中农的政策；讲划富农，就联系到不动富农自耕部的政策，这样就使群众更深刻的认识了土地改革政策。西郊罗道庄等村把划阶级与诉苦结合起来，当地主报的不确实或巧辩时，农民结合着诉苦来说理，更提高了群众的阶级觉悟。石景山、门头沟等区划阶级时，将封建部分与运输业严格分开，群众感到极为合理。个别工作组中也发生了一些偏向，如不让地主到场，对地主富农划阶级象逼供一样等，经中共京市郊委及时指出，大都得到纠正。
