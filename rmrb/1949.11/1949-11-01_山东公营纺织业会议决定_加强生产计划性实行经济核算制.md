　　Shandong Public Textile Industry Conference Decides
  　Strengthen Production Planning and Implement Economic Accounting System
    [Our Dispatch] The Shandong Provincial People's Government Production Department convened a provincial public textile conference in Qingdao from the 12th to the 18th of this month. At the meeting, each unit, based on the specific circumstances of each factory, discussed the economic accounting system, the establishment of warehouse organization systems, the unified management and inventory of materials, and anti-espionage and fire prevention measures. The meeting proposed the following future tasks: 1. In the past, coordination in various aspects was insufficient, and production management was inconsistent with the workers' movement. Workers progressed quickly, while staff progressed slowly. In the future, each factory must strengthen the education of staff, making them clearly understand the idea of serving the people and transforming the perfunctory attitude of dealing with official duties; strictly enforce the reward and punishment system; strengthen the planning of production and overcome blind and chaotic phenomena. 2. Strengthen the economic accounting system to establish a relatively accurate cost accounting system by division and category. Strengthen capital turnover, properly use raw materials, utilize accumulated waste materials, clear warehouses, and establish an organization and leadership for the economic accounting system to implement the economic accounting system and cost accounting system in all aspects of the factory. 3. Determine reasonable operation standards and work standards. Each factory must, based on its specific circumstances, formulate standards for quality, quantity, work, and materials, as well as implementation steps, as the basis for future management.
