　　(II) Welcome to the Leaders of the World Federation of Trade Unions

    The leaders of the World Federation of Trade Unions arrived in the capital of the Chinese people yesterday. They will preside over the meeting of the Executive Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions and will attend and guide the Asian and Australian Trade Union Conference decided by the World Federation of Trade Unions to be held in Beijing. The Chinese working class and the Chinese people regard the arrival of the leaders of the World Federation of Trade Unions and the convening of such a grand international workers' conference in Beijing as a great honor, and extend our highest internationalist respect to the leaders of the World Federation of Trade Unions!
    Since its establishment in September 1945, the World Federation of Trade Unions has been waging unremitting struggles for lasting world peace and the cause of people's democracy, and for the long-term interests and urgent demands of the world's working class. Progressive workers all over the world know that only by uniting their own strength can they protect their own vital interests. The World Federation of Trade Unions embodies this aspiration of the world's working class. Therefore, it has been able to gradually develop and grow stronger in the struggle to defend peace, democracy, and the interests of the working class, and in the struggle against the agents of American imperialism and right-wing trade union bosses. The World Federation of Trade Unions now has about 80 million members. Because the World Federation of Trade Unions is such a powerful democratic force with global reach and mass support, it has greatly frightened American imperialism and its henchmen, who have tried every means to strike, split, and eliminate the Federation from within and without. But these conspiracies have not achieved their goals, and democratic and progressive forces have gained an absolute advantage in the leadership of the Federation. This is a victory for the progressive workers' forces of the world. This is the correctness and success of the leadership of the leaders of the World Federation of Trade Unions.
    The upcoming Asian and Australian Trade Union Conference "will proceed under the general goal of opposing imperialism, opposing feudalism, opposing wars of aggression, opposing splitters of the world workers' movement, defending lasting world peace and people's democracy, striving for national independence for oppressed countries, and defending democratic trade union rights and the unity of the world workers' movement." "This is a conference of great unity of the working class of Asia and Australia, and a conference of great unity of the workers of Asia and Australia with the working class of the world." Under the correct leadership of the leaders of the World Federation of Trade Unions, we firmly believe that it will achieve brilliant success, and enable the workers' movements in Asian and Australian countries that are most severely oppressed by imperialism to develop more powerfully, so that the people of these countries, under the leadership of the advanced working class, can completely shatter the shackles of imperialism, just like the blows given to American imperialism and its running dog, the Kuomintang reactionaries, by the Chinese people and the Chinese working class.
    The Chinese people and the Chinese working class sincerely welcome the arrival of the leaders of the World Federation of Trade Unions. They are outstanding leaders of the workers' movements in advanced countries around the world, with extremely rich experience in struggle, which is most valuable to the Chinese people and the Chinese working class today. Under the instructions and assistance of the leaders of the World Federation of Trade Unions, we should further strive to mobilize and organize nearly 20 million working-class masses across the country to carry out tireless struggles for the complete liberation of China and for the rapid restoration and development of our country's economic construction. We will use the vanguard role of the working class to lead and promote the people of all other strata, consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class, based on the worker-peasant alliance, and unite all democratic classes and all ethnic groups in the country, and strive to support the struggles of democratic trade unions in Asian, Australian and other countries, and jointly make greater contributions to the cause of world peace and democracy.

　　（二）欢迎世界工联的领袖们
    世界工联的领袖们，已于昨日莅临中国人民的首都，将主持世界工联执行局会议，并将出席指导世界工联决定在北京召开的亚洲、澳洲工会会议。中国工人阶级和中国人民，对于世界工联领袖们的来临，对于这样盛大的国际工人会议在北京召开，认为是莫大的光荣，并向世界工联的领袖们致以崇高的国际主义的敬礼！
    世界工联从一九四五年九月成立以来，为了世界的持久和平和人民民主事业，为了世界工人阶级远大的利益和迫切的要求而进行着坚持不懈的斗争。全世界进步的工人，深知只有团结自己的力量，才能保护自己切身的利益，而世界工联正体现着世界工人阶级的这种意愿，因此，它能够在保卫和平民主和工人阶级利益的斗争中，在与美帝国主义代理人及右翼工会头子的斗争中，逐渐发展与壮大起来。现在世界工联拥有的会员已达八千万左右。由于世界工联是具有这样世界性与群众性的强大民主力量，因此使美帝国主义及其喽罗们非常恐惧，曾千方百计从内部与外部力图打击、分裂与消灭工联，但这些阴谋诡计都未达到目的，而在工联领导机构中，民主与进步力量已经占了绝对优势，这是世界进步工人力量的胜利。这是世界工联领袖们领导的正确与成功。
    行将举行的亚洲、澳洲工会会议，“将在反对帝国主义、反对封建主义、反对侵略战争、反对世界工人运动的分裂者，为保卫世界持久和平与人民民主，争取被压迫国家的民族独立，捍卫工会民主权利与世界工人运动统一的总目标下进行。”“这是一个亚洲、澳洲工人阶级大团结的会议，并且是亚洲、澳洲工人与世界工人阶级大团结的会议”，在世界工联领袖们正确领导之下，我们深信它一定会获得光辉的成就，而使受帝国主义压迫最厉害的亚洲、澳洲各国的工人运动，更强有力地开展起来，从而使这些国家的人民，在先进的工人阶级领导之下，澈底打碎帝国主义的枷锁，如象中国人民、中国工人阶级所给予美帝国主义及其走狗国民党反动派的打击一样。
    中国人民、中国工人阶级竭诚欢迎世界工联领袖们的莅临，他们都是世界先进各国工人运动的杰出领袖，具有极丰富的斗争经验，这对于今天的中国人民、中国工人阶级来说，是最可宝贵的。我们应该在世界工联领袖们的指示与帮助之下，进一步地努力动员与组织全国近二千万的工人阶级群众，去为彻底解放全中国，为我国经济建设事业的迅速恢复与发展，而进行不疲倦的斗争。以工人阶级的先锋作用来领导与推动其他各阶层的人民，巩固以工人阶级为领导的、以工农联盟为基础的、团结各民主阶级和国内各民族的人民民主专政的制度，并努力支援亚洲、澳洲各国及其他国家的民主工会的斗争，共同为世界和平民主事业作更大的贡献。
