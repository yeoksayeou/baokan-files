[News from Our Newspaper] Beijing workers, upon learning that leaders of the World Federation of Trade Unions, such as Saillant, and trade union representatives from Asian and Australian countries have arrived in Beijing successively and the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference has opened, are all delighted and encouraged. They have expressed their determination to study hard and improve production as a gift to the conference. Workers at the Clothing General Factory and the 70th Ordnance Factory have decorated their clubs with a new look, organized worker receptionists, and prepared souvenirs, ready to welcome them for visits. After hearing the news, the workers of the Water Company showed even more intense work in many workshops. Old worker Ma Zuoqing said very excitedly to everyone, "I am over fifty years old, and this is the first time I have seen labor leaders from all over the world come to Beijing for a meeting." Worker Li Liansheng said, "I hope to hear reports from labor movements in various countries so that we can learn more from them." The staff of the North China Construction Company, in a letter to the labor leaders, more clearly expressed every Chinese worker's understanding of the significance of the two meetings being held in Beijing: "We believe this is a great honor for our Chinese working class and the entire Chinese people." All the workers of the Line Division of the Beijing Electric Power Branch wrote in a letter to Saillant and the trade union representatives of Asian and Australian countries: "Your arrival in our capital to attend the meeting is a clear symbol of the great unity of the working class around the world, and this unity is the real power to fight against the common enemy of the world—imperialism." Workers at the privately-owned Renli Carpet Factory said, "Seeing the labor leaders of various countries today is like seeing all the worker brothers from various countries." Zheng Jiying, a female worker at the Second Telecommunications Bureau, expressed her determination to study internationalism diligently as a practical action to welcome international labor leaders. Long Huiwu, a young worker at the Sixth Institute of the 70th Ordnance Factory, said, "Seeing the convening of these two conferences strengthens our confidence in smashing the imperialists' conspiracy to undermine worker unity and world peace."

[Another Dispatch] Teachers and students of Peking University were very excited after hearing that the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference opened in Beijing yesterday afternoon.

Professor Zhou Peiyuan said, "It is unprecedented for such an internationally significant meeting to be held in our capital, Beijing. This goal was achieved after countless arduous struggles. This meeting will give great encouragement to our working class."

Wang Zuwang, a sophomore in the Foreign Languages Department, said, "The convening of the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference represents the unity of workers in Asia and Australia and embodies the great spirit of internationalism."
