Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 21st -- The persecution of Chinese people by the British authorities in Hong Kong is intensifying daily. More than thirty organizations formed by Chinese people from all walks of life in the area, including: The Zhongshan Youth Association, the Hong Kong and Kowloon Women's Association, the Chongzheng Alumni Association, the Bee Singing Troupe, the Red Yellow Blue Bookstore, the Haiyan Singing Troupe, the Industrial and Commercial Club, the Dagong Mutual Aid Society, the Fujian Fellow-Townsmen Association, the Dapeng Fellow-Townsmen Association, the Qiongyai Fellow-Townsmen Association, the Dongzhen Fellow-Townsmen Association, the Teachers' Welfare Association, the Qiufeng Singing Troupe, the New Youth Drama Society, the Apprentice Aspiration Society, the Hong Kong Student Readers' Club, the Youth Togetherness Society, the After-School Association, the Amateur Association, Cui Feng, Ang Sheng, and the Literary Association, have all recently received written notices from the Hong Kong Government Police Department, declaring them illegal organizations. Most of the aforementioned organizations had already registered with the Hong Kong government and been approved to conduct legal activities before the enactment of the 1949 Societies Ordinance. Their daily work involved uniting Chinese people from all strata and industries in Hong Kong to seek common welfare, study academics, promote legitimate entertainment, enthusiastically engage in public welfare, and love the motherland. In the past three or four months, these organizations have held activities such as raising funds to relieve the floods in Guangdong and Guangxi, celebrating the birth of the People's Republic of China, celebrating the liberation of their hometowns, and collecting funds and goods to comfort the People's Liberation Army. These actions are entirely legitimate activities of the Chinese people and are supported by Chinese people from all walks of life in Hong Kong.
