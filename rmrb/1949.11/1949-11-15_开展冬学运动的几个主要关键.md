Several Key Points for Carrying Out the Winter Study Movement

Last year, the winter study movement in the North China region was carried out very well in some places, but poorly in others. Generally speaking, it had the characteristics of being not universal, uneven, or starting without finishing. The objective reasons were:

In this region, the tasks of joining the army, participating in the war, supporting the front, ending land reform, and winter production were heavy. For example, in a county in the first district of Chahar Province, it was necessary to send sixteen militia companies and fifty-four donkey companies (forty-five donkeys per company). Women had to make seven pairs of large shoes each, and had to rush out four or five pairs before the New Year. Under such heavy tasks, it was difficult to carry out the winter study movement.

In some areas, due to the impact of past policy deviations, the old and new cadres were not united enough, and some people did not sufficiently understand the significance of actively engaging in production and construction after land reform. Some said, "In previous years, we could share the fruits of our labor by attending winter studies, but what is the point of attending winter studies this year?" In addition, cadres were afraid of making "style" (mistakes), and did not care or dare to manage the winter study movement, causing it to fall into an unguided and unorganized state of drift.

Individual areas were disrupted by the enemy (such as Jinzhong, Ji-Lu-Yu, and some areas bordering the enemy), and due to severe disasters (such as the Yellow River flood in counties like @山), the masses were busy fighting the enemy and engaging in production for self-salvation, making it more difficult to carry out the winter study movement. As a farmer in Anyang said, "Having nothing to eat is a big deal, attending winter studies is a small matter."

The above difficulties directly affected the development of the winter study movement, but according to the experience of various regions, these difficulties and effects can be overcome or reduced. The key lies in how to solve the following problems:

(1) Strengthening unified leadership. Under the same conditions (such as the situations mentioned above) and the same foundation (such as the old areas having a winter study movement foundation before 1946, which was largely suspended during land reform), the main key to whether winter studies could be opened and not opened, or could be done well and not done well, depended on whether there was leadership. The leadership of winter studies is: first, the instructions, calls, and inspection guidance from higher levels; second, the county level plays a decisive role; and third, the village level guarantees specific implementation. Some areas paid attention to the leadership of winter studies and helped solve practical difficulties, so the winter study movement was carried out very well. For example, Yuanchao County in Southern Hebei solved the funding and teacher problems for winter studies (out of the county's 180 full-time mass school teachers, 100 were paid a subsidy of 30-50 jin of rice, and the remaining 80 were also exempt from war service tasks). In this way, mass education can not only be carried out universally, but also be adhered to for a long time. Conversely, if the entire leadership does not pay enough attention to education work, and the cadres of the education system neglect social education work, it will be difficult to carry out the winter study movement. Yang, the director of the Education Section of Raoyang County in Central Hebei, reviewed and said, "Ideologically, we believe that it is not okay if primary schools are not done well, but it does not matter if mass schools cannot be developed." The idea of doing a good job in primary schools is correct, but winter studies should not be neglected. There are also some county education institutions that are not sound, or that neglect the leadership of winter studies due to participating in central work, resulting in only making arrangements without inspection, and instructions being ignored once they reach the village.

The experience of last year's winter studies proves that to strengthen unified leadership, the following two principles must be implemented:

(A) Unified leadership should not be a "single-handed" work style, but should be carried out by placing mass education work under unified leadership. For example, in addition to training winter study teachers, Puyang County in Ji-Lu-Yu conveyed the work of winter studies at the county-wide cadre meeting in November last year, attracting the attention of all cadres. Each district made specific arrangements at the village cadre meetings, proposing the slogan "To turn over, one must turn over one's heart; to recognize characters is to change one's mind," and stipulating that the cadres working in the village should combine land measurement with political education. In the village, the thoughts of all cadres were unified, and a Winter Study Committee was established to discuss the issue of opening winter studies. When the conditions were ripe and the masses had a voluntary demand, classes were officially started. This kind of top-down mobilization, coupled with bottom-up organization, made it easy to run winter studies well and be able to persist.

(B) Give full play to the role of the organization, strengthen leadership, cadres are responsible, and activists take the lead. In areas where the Youth League has been established, the Youth League plays an even greater role in ensuring success. In Anping County, out of 62 mass schools in four districts, 55 were established in this way; in Pingshan, out of 92 mass schools, 62 were led by the Youth League. The main cadres of Qianxinzhuang, 15 or 16 people, studied every morning, paying attention to the work experience introductions in the newspaper, discussing them in light of the actual situation of the village, and selecting certain materials, clarifying the division of labor, and deciding which cadre would speak on which material. The cadres were also mass school teachers, and the morning study was the preparation for the evening lecture. This promoted the mass learning movement. This experience shows that cadres must be participants and leaders in learning. It is not enough to simply stand outside the circle of mass learning and mobilize or even force the masses to learn. Especially under the new situation, it is necessary to improve the political and cultural level of cadres. Organizing village cadres to study is important. If it can be combined with mass learning, it will not only drive the masses, but also be supervised by the masses, achieving the effect of teaching and learning from each other.

(2) How to combine with the central work. Some areas do not have a correct understanding of the relationship between winter studies and central work, and some even oppose the two, believing that if you engage in central work, you cannot run winter studies, and if you run winter studies, it will hinder the central work. Cadres say, "Let's run winter studies after we finish the central work," and as a result, one central work is not finished, and another central work comes, so winter studies can only be put aside forever. This opposition between central work and winter study education results in the central work being done poorly. The Agricultural and Forestry Department of the Chahar Provincial Government reflected, "Because winter studies have not been carried out, this year's rural winter production has encountered great difficulties."

The heavy central tasks are contradictory to the development of winter studies, which is primarily manifested in cadres being too busy and the masses not having spare time. This point should be admitted. However, the contradiction between the winter study movement and the central work must be unified and can be unified. This unification is the correct combination of the two, seeking consistency in organizational leadership and teaching content. Experience has shown that those who have done this have not only done a good job in winter studies, but also done a good job in the central work. Here, we will only talk about one experience of combination. The understanding and practices of various regions on this issue are not consistent, but they are generally no more than three types:

The first type is to turn winter studies into a place for arranging work. Because it is arranging work, everyone must attend each household. Each time in class, cadres from various systems give a set of speeches. As a result, some people are neither voluntary nor have learning content, and winter studies become a "transmission meeting" in name only. This kind of "combination" makes the masses think that attending winter studies is just attending meetings, creating many difficulties for truly organizing mass learning in the future.

The second type is to complete the central work by opening up the masses' thinking through winter studies, so that winter studies serve the central work and the central task can be completed smoothly. This combination method has its advantages, but the disadvantage is that in terms of education content, it often only cares about completing this stage of the task and does not carry out systematic ideological education for the masses. For example, Shen County carried out education on the issuance of land certificates in winter studies, which the masses loved to hear, but even though the masses already understood it, they still repeatedly talked about the old story. The teaching content could not continue to improve, becoming a simple coordination with the central work.

The third type is winter studies combined with the central work, but it is itself a systematic education. This takes the combination of winter studies and the central work to a higher level. The experience of Shen County: In the end of the land reform, the problems that occurred in the whole village were divided into types and announced in advance, and the problems that would be talked about that day were arranged in order for education, so that it had a system. However, because the cultural and political level of our rural cadres and winter study teachers, and even primary school teachers, is generally low, it is very difficult to combine with the central work and carry out systematic education at the same time. Therefore, the issue of teaching materials must be resolved. Before the winter campaign last year, Central Hebei, Southern Hebei, Ji-Lu-Yu, and Chahar Province all compiled teaching materials for land reform and production. Although the teaching materials were systematic, how to specifically combine them with the central work was still a problem. Taihang District paid attention to the combination of current central work and compiled teaching materials, which were continuously published in newspapers, but because the solution was too slow, the winter studies were nearing the end when the teaching materials were published. Therefore, the solution to teaching materials must not only be systematic in combination with the central work, but also be delivered to winter studies in a timely manner in order to achieve the due effect.

(3) We must strengthen literacy education to meet the cultural needs of the masses. The winter studies that have achieved great results are those that have paid attention to the ideological education of the masses and also carried out cultural learning. This kind of winter study with literacy content is easier to call on the masses to participate voluntarily. Some areas (such as Taihang) have made great gains in cultural education in this year's winter studies. However, there are also many areas that only focus on political classes in winter studies and neglect learning literacy. Some people reflect, "We attend winter studies every year, but we are not literate every year." If the cultural level of the masses is not improved, it will also affect the in-depth development of political education. To carry out literacy education, we should first start with young men and women, especially to conduct future education for young people and inspire their demand for learning culture. Taking the youth as the core, cultivating backbones, and uniting all young and middle-aged people who are willing to learn culture to participate, this experience should be promoted.

(4) Organizational form and learning methods are also one of the main conditions for whether winter studies can be done well. The shortcomings of last year's winter studies were generally too laissez-faire, but in terms of specific organization, some areas had the phenomenon of forced compilation and rigid system setting. For example, after the winter study teacher of Fanjiacun, Shexian County, returned to the village after training, he compiled the group himself, stipulating that "if you don't come three times, you will be fined five catties of firewood." Some people said sarcastically: "If you work harder in the field, you can get ten catties of firewood more a day, so you can skip winter studies twice." Therefore, the organizational principle of winter studies should still adhere to the principles of mass need, voluntariness, and everyone running schools and everyone attending schools. In terms of organizational form, we cannot force uniformity. Generally, unified leadership and decentralized learning are appropriate. However, this decentralized organizational form must have unified leadership and be carried out in a planned and focused manner in order to prevent the phenomenon of drift and the problem of taking care of everything and not doing everything well.

In terms of learning methods, the masses also had a variety of creations in the past, such as combining literacy with production, acting, and learning current affairs. The shortcoming is that these experiences have not been summarized and developed. In the future, we should pay more attention to the creations of the masses in learning, and study their positive factors, and promote and promote their experience. For mass schools that insist on year-round learning, continuously enrich learning content and improve learning methods, the leadership should pay more attention to helping to consolidate and develop the achievements of winter studies, and lay the foundation for eliminating illiteracy in the future.

    开展冬学运动的几个主要关键
    去年华北区的冬学运动，有的地方开展得很好，有的地方则差，一般说，存在着不普遍、不平衡或有始无终的特点，其客观原因是：
    就本区言，是参军、参战、支前、结束土改以及冬季生产等任务繁重。如察省一专区一个县，需要出十六个民兵连，五十四个毛驴连（四十五头为一连），妇女们每人要做七双大鞋，年前就得赶出四、五双。在这样的繁重任务下，开展冬学是有困难的。
    部分地区，因过去执行政策发生偏向的影响，新旧干部不够团结，有些群众对土改后积极从事生产建设的意义认识不足，有的说：“往年上冬学可以分果实，今年上冬学干什么？”再加上干部怕犯“作风”（错误），对于冬学不管或不敢管，致冬学陷于无领导无组织的自流状态。
    个别地区受敌拔乱（如晋中冀鲁豫和一些接敌区域），并因灾情严重（如＠山等县黄河水灾），群众忙于对敌斗争生产自救，开展冬学也比较困难，正如安阳一个农民说：“没吃的是大事，上冬学是小事”。
    以上困难直接影响着冬学的开展，但据各地区的经验证明，这种困难和影响是可以克服或减少的，关键在于如何解决以下几个问题：
    （一）加强统一领导。同样的条件（如以上所举的情况），同样的基础（如老区在一九四六年前即有冬学运动基础，土改中间大部停顿），冬学有可能开办而没有开办的，有可能办好而没有办好的，其主要关键决定于有无领导。冬学的领导，一是上级的指示号召和检查指导，二是县级起决定作用，三是村级保证具体执行。有的地区注意了冬学的领导，而且帮助解决实际困难，冬学就开展的很好，如冀南元朝县解决了冬学的经费和师资问题（全县一百八十个专任群校教员中，有一百个人支给津贴米三○—五○斤，其余八十人也免了战勤任务），这样群众教育不但能普遍的开展，也能长期的坚持。反之，如果整个领导上对教育工作应有的重视不够，而教育系统干部又忽视社教工作，冬学便很难开展起来。冀中饶阳县教育科杨科长检讨说：“在思想上认为小学搞不好不行，民校开展不起来没有什么”。搞好小学的思想是对的，但不应忽视冬学。还有某些县教育机构不健全，或者因参加了中心工作疏于对冬学的领导，以致形成只布置不检查，指示一到村就没人管了。
    去年冬学的经验证明，要加强统一领导，必须贯彻以下两个原则：
    （甲）一元化领导，不应是“单打一”的工作作风，而是将群众教育工作放在统一领导之下去进行，如冀鲁豫濮县除集训冬学教员外，在去年十一月全县干部大会上，作了冬学工作的传达，引起全体干部注意。各区在村干会上作了具体布置，提出“翻身要翻心，识字换脑筋”的号召，并规定由做驻村工作的干部结合丈量土地，进行政治教育。在村里打通全体干部思想，成立冬学委员会，讨论开办冬学问题，等各方面条件成熟，群众也有了自愿的要求，才正式上课，这样自上而下的动员、加上自下而上的组织，冬学便容易办好，并能够坚持。
    （乙）发挥组织的作用，加强领导，干部负责，积极分子带头。在建团的地区，青年团则更起着保证的作用。安平县四个区，六十二个民校中，就有五十五个是这样做起来的；平山九十二座民校中，有六十二座是由青年团领导的。前辛庄主要干部十五、六人，每日早上学习，注意报上工作经验介绍，联系本村实际进行讨论，并选择一定材料，明确分工，决定那个干部讲那个材料，干部即民校教师，早上学习即是晚上的讲课准备，这样推动了群众的学习运动。这个经验说明了干部必须是学习中的参加者与带头人，光是站在群众的学习圈外，动员以至强制群众去学习是不行的。特别是在新形势发展下，必须提高干部政治文化水平，组织村干部学习是重要的，如果能与群众学习结合起来，不仅带动了群众，而且也受到群众的督促，收到教学相长的效果。
    （二）如何与中心工作结合，有些地区没有正确的了解冬学与中心工作的关系，甚至有的把二者对立起来，认为搞中心工作，就不能办冬学，办冬学就要妨碍中心工作。干部这样说：“等搞完中心工作，再办冬学罢”，结果一个中心工作未罢，另一个中心工作又来，冬学就只好永置不办了。这样把中心工作和冬学教育对立起来，结果中心工作反而作的不好。察哈尔省政府农林处反映：“因为冬学没搞起来，使今年农村冬季生产，碰到了很大的困难”。
    繁重的中心任务，对于开展办冬学是有矛盾的，首先表现在干部忙不过来，群众没有空闲时间，这一点应该承认。但冬学运动和中心工作的矛盾，是必须统一而且是可以统一的，这种统一，就是两者之正确结合，在组织领导上和教学内容上，都求得一致。经验证明，凡是这样做了的，不但办好了冬学，而且也做好了中心工作。这里只谈谈结合上的一点经验，各地对这问题的认识与做法是不一致的，但大体不外三种：
    第一种  是把冬学变成布置工作的场所。因系布置工作，就必须家家有人出席，每次上课，各系统干部都讲一套，这样有的群众既非自愿，也无学习内容，冬学便成了有名无实的“传达会议”。这种“结合”，使群众认为上冬学就是开会，给以后真正组织群众学习，造下不少困难。
    第二种  为了完成中心工作，通过冬学打通群众思想，使冬学为中心工作服务，使中心任务顺利完成。这种结合方法有其优点，但缺点是在教育内容上，往往只管完成这一段任务，不对群众进行系统的思想教育。如深县在冬学里进行颁发土地证教育，群众很爱听，但是群众已经听懂了，仍然反来复去讲老一套，教学内容不能继续提高，成为单纯的配合中心工作。
    第三种  是冬学结合中心工作进行，但本身又是有系统的进行教育，这样使冬学与中心工作的结合，提高了一步。深县的经验：在结束土改中将全村所发生的问题，分出类型，预先公布，那一天讲什么问题，依次排列好，进行教育，便有了系统。但由于我们农村干部及冬学教员甚至小学教员，文化水平、政治水平一般都较低，既要结合中心工作，又要进行系统的教育，是有很大困难的。因此就必须解决教材问题。去年冬运前，冀中、冀南、冀鲁豫、察省等，都编过土改、生产等教材，教材虽然系统了，但如何与中心工作具体结合，还是一个问题。太行区注意了结合当前中心工作，编写教材，在报纸上连续发表，但因为解决的太慢，教材发表后，冬学已到结束时期。因此教材的解决，不但要系统的结合中心工作，而且要及时的发到冬学里，才能收到应有的效果。
    （三）必须加强识字教育，满足群众文化要求。冬学收效大的，都是即注意了群众的思想教育，又进行了文化学习，这种有识字内容的冬学，便容易号召群众自愿参加。有些地区（如太行），今年冬学的文化教育收获很大。但也有不少地区只着重在冬学讲政治课，忽视学习识字，有的群众反映：“年年上冬学，年年不识字”。群众文化水平提不高，也影响了政治教育的深入。进行识字教育，首先应从男女青年着手，特别是对青年进行前途教育，启发青年学习文化的要求。以青年为核心，培养骨干，团结一切愿意学习文化的青壮年参加，这个经验应加以推广。
    （四）组织形式与学习方法，也是能否办好冬学的主要条件之一。去年冬学之缺点，一般是过于放任自流，但在具体组织方面，有的地区又有强行编制，硬定制度的现象。如涉县范家村冬学教员受训回村后，自己把组编了一下，规定“三次不到，罚柴五斤”有人便说怪话：“地里多努一把劲，一天多打十斤柴，就能两次不上冬学。”所以冬学的组织原则，仍应坚持群众需要与自愿及大家办学大家上学的原则，在组织形式上不能强求一致，一般的以统一领导与分散学习为宜。但这种分散的组织形式，必须有统一领导，并有计划有重点的进行，才能防止自流现象和处处照顾到，处处办不好的毛病。
    在学习方法上，过去群众也有多种多样的创造，如识字与生产、演剧、学习时事等相结合，缺点是没有把这些经验总结起来，发展下去。今后应多注意群众在学习上的创造，并研究其积极因素，发扬和推广其经验。对于坚持长年学习，不断充实学习内容和改进学习方法的民校，领导上更要注意帮助，以巩固与发展冬学的成果，并打下今后扫除文盲的基础。
