Several Key Points for Carrying Out the Winter Study Movement

Last year, the winter study movement in the North China region was carried out very well in some places, but poorly in others. Generally speaking, it had the characteristics of being not universal, uneven, or starting without finishing. The objective reasons were:

In this region, the tasks of joining the army, participating in the war, supporting the front, ending land reform, and winter production were heavy. For example, in a county in the first district of Chahar Province, it was necessary to send sixteen militia companies and fifty-four donkey companies (forty-five donkeys per company). Women had to make seven pairs of large shoes each, and had to rush out four or five pairs before the New Year. Under such heavy tasks, it was difficult to carry out the winter study movement.

In some areas, due to the impact of past policy deviations, the old and new cadres were not united enough, and some people did not sufficiently understand the significance of actively engaging in production and construction after land reform. Some said, "In previous years, we could share the fruits of our labor by attending winter studies, but what is the point of attending winter studies this year?" In addition, cadres were afraid of making "style" (mistakes), and did not care or dare to manage the winter study movement, causing it to fall into an unguided and unorganized state of drift.

Individual areas were disrupted by the enemy (such as Jinzhong, Ji-Lu-Yu, and some areas bordering the enemy), and due to severe disasters (such as the Yellow River flood in counties like @å±±), the masses were busy fighting the enemy and engaging in production for self-salvation, making it more difficult to carry out the winter study movement. As a farmer in Anyang said, "Having nothing to eat is a big deal, attending winter studies is a small matter."

The above difficulties directly affected the development of the winter study movement, but according to the experience of various regions, these difficulties and effects can be overcome or reduced. The key lies in how to solve the following problems:

(1) Strengthening unified leadership. Under the same conditions (such as the situations mentioned above) and the same foundation (such as the old areas having a winter study movement foundation before 1946, which was largely suspended during land reform), the main key to whether winter studies could be opened and not opened, or could be done well and not done well, depended on whether there was leadership. The leadership of winter studies is: first, the instructions, calls, and inspection guidance from higher levels; second, the county level plays a decisive role; and third, the village level guarantees specific implementation. Some areas paid attention to the leadership of winter studies and helped solve practical difficulties, so the winter study movement was carried out very well. For example, Yuanchao County in Southern Hebei solved the funding and teacher problems for winter studies (out of the county's 180 full-time mass school teachers, 100 were paid a subsidy of 30-50 jin of rice, and the remaining 80 were also exempt from war service tasks). In this way, mass education can not only be carried out universally, but also be adhered to for a long time. Conversely, if the entire leadership does not pay enough attention to education work, and the cadres of the education system neglect social education work, it will be difficult to carry out the winter study movement. Yang, the director of the Education Section of Raoyang County in Central Hebei, reviewed and said, "Ideologically, we believe that it is not okay if primary schools are not done well, but it does not matter if mass schools cannot be developed." The idea of doing a good job in primary schools is correct, but winter studies should not be neglected. There are also some county education institutions that are not sound, or that neglect the leadership of winter studies due to participating in central work, resulting in only making arrangements without inspection, and instructions being ignored once they reach the village.

The experience of last year's winter studies proves that to strengthen unified leadership, the following two principles must be implemented:

(A) Unified leadership should not be a "single-handed" work style, but should be carried out by placing mass education work under unified leadership. For example, in addition to training winter study teachers, Puyang County in Ji-Lu-Yu conveyed the work of winter studies at the county-wide cadre meeting in November last year, attracting the attention of all cadres. Each district made specific arrangements at the village cadre meetings, proposing the slogan "To turn over, one must turn over one's heart; to recognize characters is to change one's mind," and stipulating that the cadres working in the village should combine land measurement with political education. In the village, the thoughts of all cadres were unified, and a Winter Study Committee was established to discuss the issue of opening winter studies. When the conditions were ripe and the masses had a voluntary demand, classes were officially started. This kind of top-down mobilization, coupled with bottom-up organization, made it easy to run winter studies well and be able to persist.

(B) Give full play to the role of the organization, strengthen leadership, cadres are responsible, and activists take the lead. In areas where the Youth League has been established, the Youth League plays an even greater role in ensuring success. In Anping County, out of 62 mass schools in four districts, 55 were established in this way; in Pingshan, out of 92 mass schools, 62 were led by the Youth League. The main cadres of Qianxinzhuang, 15 or 16 people, studied every morning, paying attention to the work experience introductions in the newspaper, discussing them in light of the actual situation of the village, and selecting certain materials, clarifying the division of labor, and deciding which cadre would speak on which material. The cadres were also mass school teachers, and the morning study was the preparation for the evening lecture. This promoted the mass learning movement. This experience shows that cadres must be participants and leaders in learning. It is not enough to simply stand outside the circle of mass learning and mobilize or even force the masses to learn. Especially under the new situation, it is necessary to improve the political and cultural level of cadres. Organizing village cadres to study is important. If it can be combined with mass learning, it will not only drive the masses, but also be supervised by the masses, achieving the effect of teaching and learning from each other.

(2) How to combine with the central work. Some areas do not have a correct understanding of the relationship between winter studies and central work, and some even oppose the two, believing that if you engage in central work, you cannot run winter studies, and if you run winter studies, it will hinder the central work. Cadres say, "Let's run winter studies after we finish the central work," and as a result, one central work is not finished, and another central work comes, so winter studies can only be put aside forever. This opposition between central work and winter study education results in the central work being done poorly. The Agricultural and Forestry Department of the Chahar Provincial Government reflected, "Because winter studies have not been carried out, this year's rural winter production has encountered great difficulties."

The heavy central tasks are contradictory to the development of winter studies, which is primarily manifested in cadres being too busy and the masses not having spare time. This point should be admitted. However, the contradiction between the winter study movement and the central work must be unified and can be unified. This unification is the correct combination of the two, seeking consistency in organizational leadership and teaching content. Experience has shown that those who have done this have not only done a good job in winter studies, but also done a good job in the central work. Here, we will only talk about one experience of combination. The understanding and practices of various regions on this issue are not consistent, but they are generally no more than three types:

The first type is to turn winter studies into a place for arranging work. Because it is arranging work, everyone must attend each household. Each time in class, cadres from various systems give a set of speeches. As a result, some people are neither voluntary nor have learning content, and winter studies become a "transmission meeting" in name only. This kind of "combination" makes the masses think that attending winter studies is just attending meetings, creating many difficulties for truly organizing mass learning in the future.

The second type is to complete the central work by opening up the masses' thinking through winter studies, so that winter studies serve the central work and the central task can be completed smoothly. This combination method has its advantages, but the disadvantage is that in terms of education content, it often only cares about completing this stage of the task and does not carry out systematic ideological education for the masses. For example, Shen County carried out education on the issuance of land certificates in winter studies, which the masses loved to hear, but even though the masses already understood it, they still repeatedly talked about the old story. The teaching content could not continue to improve, becoming a simple coordination with the central work.

The third type is winter studies combined with the central work, but it is itself a systematic education. This takes the combination of winter studies and the central work to a higher level. The experience of Shen County: In the end of the land reform, the problems that occurred in the whole village were divided into types and announced in advance, and the problems that would be talked about that day were arranged in order for education, so that it had a system. However, because the cultural and political level of our rural cadres and winter study teachers, and even primary school teachers, is generally low, it is very difficult to combine with the central work and carry out systematic education at the same time. Therefore, the issue of teaching materials must be resolved. Before the winter campaign last year, Central Hebei, Southern Hebei, Ji-Lu-Yu, and Chahar Province all compiled teaching materials for land reform and production. Although the teaching materials were systematic, how to specifically combine them with the central work was still a problem. Taihang District paid attention to the combination of current central work and compiled teaching materials, which were continuously published in newspapers, but because the solution was too slow, the winter studies were nearing the end when the teaching materials were published. Therefore, the solution to teaching materials must not only be systematic in combination with the central work, but also be delivered to winter studies in a timely manner in order to achieve the due effect.

(3) We must strengthen literacy education to meet the cultural needs of the masses. The winter studies that have achieved great results are those that have paid attention to the ideological education of the masses and also carried out cultural learning. This kind of winter study with literacy content is easier to call on the masses to participate voluntarily. Some areas (such as Taihang) have made great gains in cultural education in this year's winter studies. However, there are also many areas that only focus on political classes in winter studies and neglect learning literacy. Some people reflect, "We attend winter studies every year, but we are not literate every year." If the cultural level of the masses is not improved, it will also affect the in-depth development of political education. To carry out literacy education, we should first start with young men and women, especially to conduct future education for young people and inspire their demand for learning culture. Taking the youth as the core, cultivating backbones, and uniting all young and middle-aged people who are willing to learn culture to participate, this experience should be promoted.

(4) Organizational form and learning methods are also one of the main conditions for whether winter studies can be done well. The shortcomings of last year's winter studies were generally too laissez-faire, but in terms of specific organization, some areas had the phenomenon of forced compilation and rigid system setting. For example, after the winter study teacher of Fanjiacun, Shexian County, returned to the village after training, he compiled the group himself, stipulating that "if you don't come three times, you will be fined five catties of firewood." Some people said sarcastically: "If you work harder in the field, you can get ten catties of firewood more a day, so you can skip winter studies twice." Therefore, the organizational principle of winter studies should still adhere to the principles of mass need, voluntariness, and everyone running schools and everyone attending schools. In terms of organizational form, we cannot force uniformity. Generally, unified leadership and decentralized learning are appropriate. However, this decentralized organizational form must have unified leadership and be carried out in a planned and focused manner in order to prevent the phenomenon of drift and the problem of taking care of everything and not doing everything well.

In terms of learning methods, the masses also had a variety of creations in the past, such as combining literacy with production, acting, and learning current affairs. The shortcoming is that these experiences have not been summarized and developed. In the future, we should pay more attention to the creations of the masses in learning, and study their positive factors, and promote and promote their experience. For mass schools that insist on year-round learning, continuously enrich learning content and improve learning methods, the leadership should pay more attention to helping to consolidate and develop the achievements of winter studies, and lay the foundation for eliminating illiteracy in the future.
