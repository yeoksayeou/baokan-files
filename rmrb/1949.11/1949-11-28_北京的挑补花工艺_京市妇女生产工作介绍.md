Beijing's Drawnwork and Appliqué Embroidery Craft
Introduction to Women's Production Work in Beijing Municipality
Bai Sheng

Drawnwork and appliqué embroidery are one of Beijing's famous specialty handicrafts, a purely female handicraft production capable of earning a large amount of foreign exchange. Drawnwork is what people used to call cross-stitch, and appliqué embroidery is the appliqué of edged flowers onto cloth. Its development has a considerable history and is famous in the world. Its sales have reached capitalist countries such as Britain and the United States, as well as Syria, Annam, and other places. After the liberation of Beijing, under the policy of supporting the export of specialty handicrafts, and under the organization and leadership of the Municipal Women's Federation, more than two thousand working women have participated in this production.

Drawnwork originated in Shantou, Guangdong, and was introduced by foreign missionaries during the Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty. It was introduced to Beijing in 1920. The first to establish it was the privately-owned Cishang Factory. Appliqué embroidery developed nearly twenty years after drawnwork. It used to be called "duilingzi," which was a prototype of appliqué embroidery.

The birthplace of drawnwork and appliqué embroidery in Beijing is in the western suburbs of Haidian, Lan Dian Chang, Da Youzhuang, Wanshou Mountain, and the area west of Tongzhou in the eastern suburbs, Guancheng outside Chaoyangmen, and the Beixinqiao, northeast corner, and northwest corner areas within the city. This is because these places, especially the Haidian and Lan Dian Chang areas, were formerly inhabited by Qing Dynasty bannermen. The bannermen used to live a life of affluence and were accustomed to enjoyment. Generally, the physical constitutions of the women were weaker, and most of them were unable to do rough work. Therefore, when life later became difficult, drawnwork and appliqué embroidery production became a very good kind of household sideline. However, the development of drawnwork and appliqué embroidery later was not entirely limited to bannermen women. Working women from ordinary families also used this as a sideline. But compared to others, the handwork of the bannermen women was still the most exquisite.

According to statistics, there are currently seventy-seven private drawnwork and appliqué embroidery factories in Beijing engaged in drawnwork and appliqué embroidery production, most of which are piecework. These factories have now joined the Beijing Specialty Handicraft Industry Federation. In addition, the Production Department of the Beijing Municipal Women's Federation, centered on Haidian, organized a group of working women from families and also began a trial run of a drawnwork and appliqué embroidery factory. The Municipal Women's Federation first found some skilled working women from families through private drawnwork and appliqué embroidery factories, adopted the method of centralized leadership and decentralized production, and handed them raw materials in exchange for finished products to work on. Then, they further organized production groups. At first, only forty or fifty people participated, but later it gradually developed to one hundred and forty-five people. Because the work was carried out quickly, the Municipal Women's Federation finally decided to formally establish a work station in Haidian. On July 1st, with a loan from the People's Bank, the drawnwork and appliqué embroidery factory was officially established and started work. The number of participants reached a maximum of two hundred and nine people. The composition of the workers: bannermen account for one-third, and their families are peddlers, tricycle drivers, etc. Most of them take drawnwork and appliqué embroidery as a sideline, and mostly take the work home to do. They are generally very skilled, and some are even old workers. In the past, they mostly adopted a conservative attitude towards technology, unwilling to let others see it, and on the other hand, they felt ashamed to engage in this kind of handicraft production, and did not even let relatives and friends know about it. This time, after the work station conducted education, their thinking has been largely changed, and they have automatically requested to organize production groups, improve technology, ensure quality, and complete tasks. In the three months from July to October, they completed a total of seven hundred and fifteen sets of work. The wages are piecework based on needle count and thread count. Now, fast hands can get 150 jin of millet per month. General workers can get 90 jin of millet. This is a great help to the household income of working women from families. They are very active in rushing work, changing styles, and creating new patterns. At the same time, they saved 409 spools of thread in two months.

The main raw materials and tools for drawnwork and appliqué embroidery are ramie cloth, cotton cloth, colored thread, Korean gauze, glass gauze, and embroidery needles, all of which are very simple. There are many products made of drawnwork and appliqué embroidery, such as carrying cloths, tea mats, handkerchiefs, pillowcases, bed sheets, table cloths, etc. The products are extremely exquisite and are one of the most popular specialty handicrafts for export. Drawnwork is more complicated and costly. It first requires selecting materials, drawing patterns, cutting patterns, selecting patterns, matching threads, and then starting to pick large patterns, making flowers, serging, and then making matching patterns, hitting rows, etc. Appliqué embroidery is relatively easy: drawing patterns, cutting flowers, tracing flowers, powdering flowers, drawing flowers, serging, pulling the work, and ironing it to complete.

Currently, winter has arrived, and the suburbs are in the slack season for farming. It is also the peak season for drawnwork and appliqué embroidery production. Closing the door, the women sit on the warmed kang, picking up needles and threads, which should be a very pleasant labor.

According to statistics in September, the sales of drawnwork and appliqué embroidery reached HK$20,000 for foreign sales and 30 million yuan (RMB) for domestic sales; in October, foreign sales were the same as in September, and domestic sales increased to 40 million yuan. Recently, the industry has been in contact with the Soviet Union and various new democratic countries in Eastern Europe to seek expansion of sales.

　　北京的挑补花工艺
  　京市妇女生产工作介绍
    柏生
    挑补花是北京著名的特种手工艺之一种，是一种能够用以换取大量外汇的纯妇女手工业生产。挑花就是过去人们所说的十字花，补花是用布补上去的免边花。它的发展已有着相当的历史，并且在世界上是有名的，它的销路曾到达英美等资本主义国家以及叙利亚安南等地。北京解放后，在扶植特种手工业出口的方针下，经过市妇联的组织领导，已有两千个以上的劳动妇女参加这种生产。
    最早挑花是起源于广东汕头，是清朝光绪年间由外国传教士带来的，民国九年传到北京。首先创办的是私营慈商工厂。补花则是在挑花以后，近二十年发展的，从前叫做堆绫子，就是补花的一种雏型。
    挑补花在北京的发祥地是在西郊海甸、蓝靛厂、大有庄、万寿山和东郊通州以西、朝阳门外关厢，以及城内北新桥、东北城角、西北城角一带地方。因这些地方，尤其是海甸、蓝靛厂区域，过去都是清朝旗人所居住的地方。旗人过去生活优裕，享受已惯，一般妇女体质较弱，多不能做粗活，因此当后来生活困难时，挑补花生产便是她们很好的一种家庭副业。但挑补花发展到后来则也不完全限于旗人妇女了，一般家庭劳动妇女也都以此为副业。但比起来，仍以旗人妇女的手工做得最精细。
    据统计，目前北京从事挑补花生产的已有七十七家私营挑补花工厂，大部分是散工。这些工厂现均已参加北京市特种手工艺联合会。此外北京市妇联生产部，以海甸为中心，组织了一部分家庭劳动妇女，也开始试办了一个挑补花工厂。市妇联首先通过私营挑补花工厂，找到了一些有技术的家庭劳动妇女，采取集中领导，分散生产，以原料换成品的办法，交给她们代作。然后便进一步组织起生产小组。开始只有四五十人参加，后来逐渐发展到了一百四十五人。因为工作开展得很快，最后市妇联便决定在海甸正式设立工作站。七月一日由人民银行贷款，挑补花工厂就正式成立开工。人数参加最多时会达到二百零九人。工人的成分，旗人占三分之一，她们的家庭是摊贩，三轮车夫等。大部分以挑补花为副业，多是把活拿回家里去做。她们一般都很有技术，有些并且是老工人。过去她们对技术多是采取保守态度，不愿给人看，另一方面又以从事这种手工生产为可羞，连亲友也不让知道。这次经过工作站进行教育后，她们的思想已大部改变过来，并自动要求组织生产小组，提高技术，保证质量，完成任务。从七月到十月的三个月中间，她们共做了七百一十五套活。工资则是计针计线的计件工资制。现在快手每月可拿到一百五十斤小米。普遍工可拿到九十斤小米。这对家庭劳动妇女的贴补家用是一个很大的帮助。她们对赶活，换样子，创造新的花样都很积极，同时两个月里并节省了四○九把线。
    挑补花主要的原料和工具是夏布、棉布、彩线、高丽纱、玻璃纱、绣花针，均很简单。挑补花制成的用品很多，如抬布、茶垫、手绢、枕套、床单、餐布等，制品均极为精美，是对外出口品中最受欢迎的特种手工艺之一种。挑花的做法比较复杂，成本也较高。它首先要选料、画样、剪样、选样、配线，之后开始挑大活，做花、锁边，再做配活，打趟等。补花则比较容易，画样、剪花、描花、粉花、画花、免边、牵活、熨烫后即成。
    目前冬季已到，郊区正届农闲时节，同时也是挑补花生产最盛的季节，关起门来，妇女们坐在烧暖的炕头上，挑起针线，该是一件非常愉快的劳动。
    挑补花业的销路，据九月份统计外销达港币两万元，内销三千万元（人民币）；十月份外销与九月份相同，内销则增加为四千万元。最近该业已与苏联及东欧各新民主主义国家连系，以谋销路的扩大。
