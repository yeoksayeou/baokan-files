He first pointed out the casualties suffered by Italian farm laborers in their arduous and bloody heroic struggle against the tyranny of the police and landlords, and then spoke of the increasingly deteriorating situation in the countryside. He pointed out that there are already one million people regularly unemployed in rural areas. Finally, he extended warm and fraternal greetings to the Soviet collective farmers, Chinese peasants, and all men and women laborers fighting for peace. The congress passed a resolution reaffirming the readiness of Italian agricultural workers to carry out the struggle for "work, freedom, and bread" under the leadership of the General Confederation of Labor. The congress elected a new guiding committee for the union and approved Romagnoli as its secretary.
