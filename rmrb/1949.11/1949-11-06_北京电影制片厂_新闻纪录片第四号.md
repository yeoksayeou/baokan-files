    The fourth production of the Beijing Film Studio, is now being screened in the capital. Its content mainly includes the following parts:

    One, "Military Flag", reports the solemn ceremony of Commander Nie Rongzhen awarding the flag to the North China Special Forces and the troops guarding the capital on the "August 1st" Army Day.

    Two, "Briefing", from here you can see the Northeast people celebrating "August 15th", mechanized farms, and the production of the Yuncheng Salt Pond in Shanxi.

    Three, "Embarking on a Path to Life", this is a record of the actual situation of the work of reforming beggars in Beijing and Tianjin. Concrete facts illustrate that the beggars created by the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang in the past have become labor producers in the new democratic society.

    Four, "Record of the Fourth Field Army Going South", narrates the enthusiastic welcome the "Fourth Field Army" received from the people along the way when marching into Central China, and the soldiers' tireless help in harvesting crops for the peasants. Along the way, workers scrambled to repair bridges and build roads. Wuhan was liberated, and on June 4th, a grand celebration was held in Hankou.

    Five, "Great Shanghai Celebrates Victory", shows the indescribable joy emanating from the hearts of the people of Great Shanghai who have been freed from internal and external oppression. On the July 7th Memorial Day, the people of Shanghai celebrated the victory of liberation on the one hand, and held a grand military parade on the other. A parade of over a million people was carried out enthusiastically.

    This film further points out the power of the people and the impending demise of the reactionary enemy.

    北京电影制片厂的第四号出品，即在首都放映了。它内容主要包括了这样几个部分：
    一、“军旗”，报导“八一”建军日聂荣臻司令授旗华北特种兵团和卫戍首都的部队的庄严仪式。
    二、“简报”，从这里可以看到东北人民的庆祝“八、一五”，机械耕作的农场，山西运城盐池的生产。
    三、“踏上生路”，这是记录了京津改造乞丐工作的实况。以具体的事实说明过去国民党反动派统治所造成的乞丐，在新民主主义社会中变为劳动生产者了。
    四、“第四野战军南下记”，叙述着“四野”向华中进军时，一路受到人民各种热情的欢迎，战士们不辞辛劳的帮助农民收割。一路上工人们抢着修桥筑路。解放了武汉和六月四日汉口举行了空前盛大的庆祝。
    五、“大上海欢庆胜利”，表现了大上海人民从解脱了内外压迫，内心中发出不可抑制的欢欣。七七纪念那天，上海的人民，一方面在庆祝着解放的胜利，一方面举行着隆重的阅兵典礼。热烈地进行着百万人以上的大游行。
    这部片子更进一步指出了人民力量的强大，反动敌人的频于灭亡。
