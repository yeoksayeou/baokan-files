Several Key Issues in Plague Prevention and Control
Central Anti-Epidemic Committee Propaganda Department

The severity of the plague is unmatched by any other disease. Its characteristics are rapid and widespread transmission, coupled with a short illness duration and high mortality rate. Often, if one person contracts the plague, the entire family and village can be wiped out. Failure to implement timely and appropriate prevention and control measures will lead to an irreparable situation. Therefore, not only should the military and civilians in the epidemic areas regard plague eradication as their top priority, but also areas slightly further away from the epidemic, such as Suiyuan, Hebei, and Shanxi provinces, should not be negligent and should take emergency precautions. Places with dense populations and developed transportation, such as Beijing and Tianjin, should be especially vigilant and implement appropriate preventive measures. This is the most effective way to prevent the plague from spreading further. Eradicating the plague is not something that can be achieved by a single local area within the epidemic zone; it requires the joint efforts of the Party, government, military, and civilians throughout North China, Northeast China, and other relevant regions. In particular, medical personnel in the Beijing and Tianjin areas should volunteer in large numbers and heroically participate in this work!

Although the plague is frightening, we are confident in preventing it and completely eliminating it based on the anti-epidemic experiences of the Soviet Union and Northeast China. The following are several key issues in plague prevention and control:

First, strengthen grassroots organizations, enhance leadership, and ensure close cooperation between technical and administrative personnel. The joint order issued by the North China People's Government and the North China Military Region stipulates that each province and city must immediately organize an anti-epidemic committee, with leaders at all levels of the military and government personally participating to strengthen leadership. Anti-epidemic committees should also be organized in counties, districts, and villages within the epidemic and quarantine zones. Every ten households in villages and streets should have an anti-epidemic group leader to check and report on the health status of these ten households.

According to the experiences of Northeast China and Inner Mongolia, if the grassroots anti-epidemic organizations are sound, then all other problems are easier to solve. Because anti-epidemic work itself is a mass movement, when the masses understand the purpose of epidemic prevention and use their own strength to protect their own lives and health, they will be active, conscientious, and responsible, and thus the anti-epidemic work will certainly achieve results. Therefore, whether in epidemic or quarantine zones, emphasis should be placed on organizing and mobilizing the masses. These areas should normally organize the masses to carry out general sanitation, rat-catching, and flea extermination work. In the event of a plague outbreak, the masses should be mobilized to be responsible for inspection and early reporting, implement strict lockdowns, and prohibit any pedestrians, vehicles, or horses from entering or leaving the epidemic area.

The Party and government officials in charge of the epidemic area must recognize that preventing and controlling the plague to protect the people's lives is the primary responsibility of the People's Government and a true demonstration of responsibility to the masses. If the anti-epidemic leading organs neither take over everything nor let things drift and abandon leadership, then the anti-epidemic work will be guaranteed to be completed successfully under the unified conditions of sound grassroots organizations and concentrated strong leadership.

The experience of Northeast China tells us that any place where anti-epidemic work is successful is where administrative and technical personnel cooperate well, and any place where the plague spreads is where administrative and technical personnel are disconnected. Therefore, administrative personnel should regard anti-epidemic work as a major task in all government work and be responsible for assisting anti-epidemic personnel in completing it, and should not regard anti-epidemic work as solely the responsibility of anti-epidemic personnel. On the other hand, anti-epidemic personnel should not emphasize technology and anti-epidemic measures while neglecting other local work, especially leading production work. Only when administrative personnel and anti-epidemic personnel respect and help each other and coordinate anti-epidemic work well with other work can the anti-epidemic task be completed.

Second, strengthen publicity and education. Anti-epidemic work is mass work. We must mobilize the masses, organize the masses, and rely on the creativity, consciousness, and strength of the masses to do a good job in anti-epidemic work and completely eliminate the plague. The experience of Northeast China tells us that an anti-epidemic team and a rat-catching team of more than forty people worked for more than three months and only caught more than four thousand rats, while in Tongliao alone, after mobilizing the masses to catch rats, they caught 476,875 rats in just ten days, a difference of one hundred and twenty times. It can be seen that the power of the masses is very great. Rat-catching work is like this, and so is other anti-epidemic work. However, to give play to the power of the masses, it is not enough to rely on administrative orders; we must enlighten the consciousness of the masses. And in order to enlighten the consciousness of the masses, we must strengthen publicity work. Publicity work must be carried out in a popular way using actual and vivid local examples, so that it is easily accepted by the masses. Only in this way will all superstitious ideas among the masses be broken down. We should rely on the activists among the masses and use them as the core to carry out publicity and promote work.

In addition, when launching sanitation, rat-catching, and flea-killing campaigns, a campaign for meritorious service should be launched among the masses, with rewards for those who have made contributions and penalties for those who have made mistakes. This is one of the effective ways to promote work and educate the masses.

Third, thoroughness of work. After the masses are mobilized, the work of rat-catching and flea extermination, preventive injections, grasping the situation of the epidemic area, early detection of patients, and implementing lockdowns and isolation can be done relatively well. However, if the anti-epidemic personnel in charge have a bureaucratic style, allowing the work to become a mere formality, or are unable to conduct in-depth inspections and trust the masses too much, then more and greater plague outbreaks will inevitably occur because the work is not done thoroughly. In 1948, Kongjia Wobao in Tongliao and Mengjiatun in Kailu, Northeast China, both concealed patients and reported late, failing to isolate and lock down in time, resulting in family transmission and neighbor transmission, so that the plague spread to the whole village and from one village to several other villages. In contrast, the Cultural Village of Anguang County in Liaobei Province mobilized 150 militiamen to set up six outposts. The militiamen stood guard day and night in double shifts, determined to keep the Cultural Village permanently free from the plague disaster. The younger brother and mother of the group leader of the seventh group ran a restaurant in Lixian Town. The younger brother fell ill and died, and the mother wanted to come back. When she walked to the guard post, she happened to see him standing guard there. He said to his mother, "Consider your son temporarily unfilial, don't harm everyone, go back." This resolute blockade in Cultural Village caused dissatisfaction among other villages, but precisely because the blockade was good, the village never had a plague outbreak.

Now, the Central People's Government has established the Central Anti-Epidemic Committee to specifically preside over the work of plague prevention and control, and has issued a circular to all levels of people's government to quickly establish anti-epidemic committees at all levels, and has mobilized all manpower and material resources to provide specific assistance. As long as the Party, government, military, and civilians in the epidemic and quarantine zones can study in detail and thoroughly solve the above-mentioned key issues, then even the most fierce plague will be eliminated by us in a short period of time.

　　防治鼠疫的几个关键问题
    中央防疫委员会宣传处
    鼠疫为害之烈，可以说是任何一种疾病都不能和它比拟。它的特点就是传播很快而且范围很广大，同时患者死亡日期短促，死亡率很高。因此往往一人得了鼠疫，全家全村都一起死光。如果不能及时加以适当的防治，任其发展，就会形成不可挽救的局势。因此不仅疫区军民应该以扑灭鼠疫为当前的首要任务，就是距离疫区稍远的地方，象绥远、河北、山西等省也不应疏忽，应该作紧急防范；象北京、天津人烟稠密交通发达的地方，尤其应该严重警惕。进行适宜的预防措施，这是最有效的防止鼠疫扩大蔓延的办法。因为鼠疫的扑灭，不是疫区一个局部地区所能作到的，必须依靠整个华北、东北以及其他有关地区的党政军民的共同努力。尤其是北京、天津地区的医务人员更应该大批自动地英勇地参加这一工作！
    鼠疫虽然可怕，但是根据苏联和东北的防疫经验，我们是有信心预防并且把它完全消灭的。下面就是防治鼠疫的几个关键问题：
    第一、健全基层组织，加强领导，技术和行政要密切配合。华北人民政府和华北军区联合发布的命令规定各省市立即组织防疫委员会，各级军政首长必须亲身参加，加强领导。疫区、检疫区内各县区村，也须要组织防疫委员会，村街每十家应有一个防疫小组长来检查和报告这十家人员的健康状况。
    根据东北和内蒙的经验，如果防疫的基层组织健全，那么其他一切问题就都比较容易解决。因为防疫工作本身就是一个群众工作，当群众了解了防疫的目的，用他们自己的力量来保护他们本身的生命和健康的时候，他们就会积极认真负责，因而防疫工作也就一定会收到效果。所以不论疫区或检疫区都应该重视组织和发动群众的工作。这些地区平时应该组织群众执行一般的卫生清洁、捕老鼠和消灭跳蚤等工作，在一旦鼠疫发生的时候，就要动员群众负责检查和早期报告，执行严格的封锁，禁止任何行人车马出进疫区。
    疫区的党政负责人员必须认清防治鼠疫以保障人民生命的安全是人民政府的首要责任，是对人民大众真正负责的表现。如果防疫领导机关不包办代替，也不放任自流，放弃领导，则在健全基层组织和集中强力领导二者统一的条件下，防疫工作便有了胜利完成的保证。
    东北的经验告诉我们：凡是防疫工作有成绩的地方，都是行政与技术配合得好的地方，凡是鼠疫扩大的地方，都是行政与技术脱节的地方。所以行政人员应当把防疫工作看成所有政权工作中的一个重大工作，要负责协助防疫人员来完成而不应当把防疫工作认为只是防疫人员自己的工作。另一方面，防疫人员也不应当强调技术，强调防疫，而忽视了其他地方工作，特别是领导生产的工作。只有行政人员和防疫人员相互尊敬，相互帮助，把防疫工作和其他工作很好地配合起来，才能完成防疫任务。
    第二、加强宣传教育工作。防疫工作是群众工作。必须发动群众，组织群众，依靠群众的创造性、群众的自觉和群众的力量才能作好防疫工作，彻底消灭鼠疫。东北的经验告诉我们，防疫队、捕鼠队四十多人工作三个多月，才捕得四千多只老鼠，而在通辽一地，在发动群众捕鼠后，仅仅在十天之内，就捕得了四十七万六千八百七十五只，两者相差一百二十倍。可见群众力量是非常伟大的。捕鼠工作如此，其他防疫工作也是如此。但是要发挥群众的力量，只靠行政命令是不成的，必须启发群众的自觉性。而为了启发群众的自觉性，必须加强宣传工作。宣传工作必须以当地实际生动的例子通过通俗的方式来进行，才容易为群众所乐意接受。只有这样，群众中的一切迷信思想，也才会不攻自破。应该依靠群众中的积极分子，以他们为核心进行宣传、推动工作。
    此外，在发动卫生清洁、捕鼠和灭蚤运动的时候，应该在群众里面展开立功竞赛运动，有功者奖，有过者罚。这是推动工作、教育群众的有效办法之一。
    第三、工作的彻底性。当群众发动起来以后，对于捕鼠灭蚤、预防注射、掌握疫区情况、早期发见病人，实行封锁、隔离等工作，都可以做得比较好。但是防疫负责人员，如果有官僚主义的作风，使工作流于形式，或是不能深入检查，过分信任群众，那么就必然会因为工作做得不彻底而发生更多更大的鼠疫。一九四八年东北通辽的孔家窝堡和开鲁的孟家屯，都是因为隐瞒病人，报告晚了，没有能够及时隔离封锁，以致于造成家族传染，邻舍传染，以致鼠疫蔓延到全村，并且由一村传到其他的几个村子。与此相反，辽北省安广县文化村动员了自卫队员一百五十名设立了六处岗口，自卫队员们昼夜站双岗，个个下决心保持文化村永久不受鼠疫灾难的侵害。第七组组长的弟弟和母亲在礼贤镇开饭馆，弟弟得病死了，妈妈要回来，他妈走到岗哨旁边，正赶上他在那里站岗，他对他妈说：“算你儿子暂时不孝，不要害了大伙，还是回去吧。”文化村这种坚决封锁虽然引起其他村的不满，但是正因为封锁得好，所以该村始终没有发生鼠疫。
    现在中央人民政府已经成立了中央防疫委员会，专门主持防治鼠疫的工作，并通令各级人民政府迅速成立各级防疫委员会，并动员了一切人力物力予以具体帮助。只要疫区和检疫区的党政军民能够详细研究并彻底解决上述的几个关键问题，则再凶猛的鼠疫也将会在短期内被我们消灭。
