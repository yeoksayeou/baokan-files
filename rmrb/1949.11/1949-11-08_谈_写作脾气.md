On "Writing Temperament"
　　Yu Cong

　　A comrade wrote an article and sent it to a magazine for publication. The editor of the magazine sent a letter with some suggestions, hoping he would revise it and send it back. He glanced at it and said unhappily, "Use it if you want, forget it if you don't. I've always had this writing temperament!" As a result, the article was neither revised nor sent back.

　　In the old society, so-called "writing temperament" came in many forms. It seemed that anyone who wrote articles wasn't flavorful enough without some "temperament"! Among these, the most common was the unwillingness to have editors revise one's manuscripts. I remember when I first started writing, I would write "No alterations allowed" at the end of my manuscript, as if it were a disgrace to my reputation if someone else revised what I had written. Another reason for the unwillingness to have editors revise one's articles was that under the oppression of the reactionary ruling class, there was no freedom of speech, and articles expressing the truth were often arbitrarily deleted and altered by editors, losing their original meaning. At that time, the existence of this "writing temperament" had a certain meaning of resistance to the reactionary rulers. But is there any benefit to the existence of this "temperament" today? It is worth studying.

　　Today's literature and art must affirm and express this new era and the new figures of this era. Therefore, writing must be based on these new life experiences and scientific theoretical knowledge. However, a person's new life experience and theoretical level may not be sufficient, so it is always necessary to humbly learn from the masses, and especially from comrades with rich experience in struggle or those who participated. Learn from their experience, listen to their opinions, constantly enrich your materials, and revise your works to make your work more complete and play a better role in reality. Others' opinions may differ from yours, or they may not be correct, but they should be studied humbly, and incorrect ones can be discussed. If others offer suggestions on one's work, and one displays one's "writing temperament" and simply ignores them, it shows arrogance and a lack of a humble attitude towards learning from the masses.

　　Today, expressing the new era and new figures in writing is still a new topic for both old writers and comrades who are new to writing. Standing on the position of serving the people, if you still don't get rid of this "writing temperament," you will not be able to serve the people better, and for yourself, it is also a stumbling block on the road to writing progress.

### 谈“写作脾气”

　　谈“写作脾气”
    于骢
    有一位同志写了一篇稿子，寄给一个杂志去发表。杂志的编者来了一封信，提了一些意见，希望他修改以后再寄去。他看了看不太高兴地说：“用就用，不用就算了，我向来就是这个写作脾气！”结果，这篇稿子也没修改，也没寄回去。
    所谓“写作脾气”，在旧社会里是多种多样的，好象凡是写写文章的人，没有点“脾气”，便不够味似的！其中尤以不愿编辑修改自己的稿子为最普遍。记得我刚学写稿子的时候，就在稿子后边写上“不准删改”；仿佛自己写的稿子被别人修改了对自己面子很不光采。造成不愿编辑修改自己文章的另外一种原因，便是因为在反动的统治阶级压迫下，没有言论自由，表达真理的文章，往往被编辑任意删改而失掉原意。在那时，这种“写作脾气”的存在，对反动的统制者是具有一定的反抗意义的。但，在今天，这个“脾气”的存在，有没有好处？就值得研究了。
    今天的文学和艺术，肯定的要表现这个新的时代和这个时代的新人物。因此要写作必须要有这些新的生活体验和科学的理论知识来作基础。但是一个人新的生活经验和理论水平，不一定已经很够了，因此，时刻还需要虚心地向群众学习，同时还尤其应该向斗争经验丰富或参加的同志们学习。学习他们的经验，听取他们的意见；随时丰富自己的素材，修改自己的作品，使你的作品更完整，对现实起更好的作用。别人的意见可能有些和你的意见不一致，也可能不正确，但，应当虚心地加以研究，不正确的还可以讨论。如果别人一对自己的作品提意见，就拿出自己的“写作脾气”来，干脆不理，这就说明自己思想上的自高自大，和缺乏向群众虚心学习的态度。
    今天，在写作上要表现新的时代，新的人物；无论在老作家或新学写作的同志来说，都还是一个新的课题。站在为人民服务的立场上，如果还不去掉这个“写作脾气”，对人民说，不能更好的服务，对自己说，也是写作前进路上的绊脚石。
