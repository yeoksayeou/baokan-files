Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 7th: TASS, Moscow, November 7th: The full text of Malenkov's report at the Moscow Soviet celebration of the 32nd anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution on November 6, 1949, is as follows:

    Comrades, the various peoples of the Soviet Union and our friends abroad are celebrating the 32nd anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution.

    The Soviet people are watching the results of their struggle and work with justifiable pride. Comrades, the era in which you and I live will be forever enshrined in our country's history as the era of the great Stalin.

    Never in the history of our country have the various nationalities inhabiting its vast territory been so closely united. The national discord and hostility that permeated our country before the revolution have long been replaced by friendship and fraternal cooperation among all nationalities. In the great alliance of the various nationalities of the Soviet Union, the creative power of large and small nationalities has found an outlet.

    Never in its entire history has our country had such fair and orderly national borders as it does today. Take a look at the map. In the West, Ukraine has reunited all its Ukrainian people in one family. The historical injustices to the borders of Belarus and Moldova have been eliminated. There is no longer East Prussia in the West, which for centuries has been a base for attacking our country. Looking north, the new borders have been defined very safely, strengthening the defense of Leningrad. In the Far East, the Kuril Islands have new significance in increasing our country's security, and the now fully restored Sakhalin Island plays a greater role in defending the Soviet Union as a whole, not just partially.

    Never in its entire history has our country been surrounded by neighbors so friendly to our country as it is today. On the borders of the Soviet Union, there is no longer a Polish state hostile to Russia, now we have a friendly People's Democratic Poland; Czechoslovakia, which was dismembered by the Hitler gangs and had only recently groaned under the shackles of fascist invaders, does not exist, we have a friendly People's Democratic Czechoslovakia; Hungary, which used to be a servant of Hitler's Germany, does not exist, we have a friendly Hungarian People's Republic; Romania hostile to the Soviet Union does not exist, we have a friendly Romanian People's Republic; the old Bulgaria, which used to be an appendage of Hitler's war machine, does not exist, the Soviet Union has a loyal friend in the Bulgarian People's Republic. Eternal friendship firmly unites the peoples of Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria with the various nationalities of the Soviet Union; in the East, the Soviet Union borders the Mongolian People's Republic, with which we have long-standing ties of friendship; the young Democratic People's Republic of Korea is our friendly neighbor; and finally, China, which was enslaved by foreign capitalist plunderers, no longer exists, now we have a great friendly neighbor in the East - the free People's Republic of China.

    On this great 32nd anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, the Soviet people are filled with unwavering belief that our country will continue to advance victoriously towards communism. In the great competition between the socialist and capitalist systems, the superiority of the socialist system is clearly visible.

    It is enough to recall that the Soviet Union, during the thirty-two years of its existence, has undergone two tense war tests - the war against internal and external enemies from 1918 to 1920 and the Great Patriotic War against Nazi aggression from 1941 to 1945 - to see this. On the other hand, we know that the strongest of the capitalist countries - the United States of America - developed for more than eighty years in almost complete peace, with no one hindering its economic construction. This is a significant fact that anyone seeking a fair and objective judgment of the achievements of the socialist economic system should not forget.

    The people of our country are deeply convinced of the justice of their cause. The doctrine of Marxism-Leninism, which has captured the hearts of the masses, has become a great force in the struggle for the new to defeat the old, in the struggle for socialism to defeat capitalism.

　　(1) We are standing on a solid road towards new victories

    On this thirty-second anniversary of the October Revolution, the Soviet people have shown considerable achievements in all sectors of the socialist economy and culture.

    It has been three years and ten months since the Soviet people, under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party, began implementing the first Stalinist post-war Five-Year Plan. With a sense of satisfaction for the responsibilities that have been fulfilled, we can now say that our national economy has not only reached pre-war levels but has also surpassed them. We have every reason to believe that the first post-war Five-Year Plan will be completed ahead of schedule.

    According to the Five-Year Plan, the total industrial output of the Soviet Union in 1950 should exceed the pre-war year of 1940 by 48 percent. In October of this year, the total industrial output exceeded the average monthly output in 1940 by more than 50 percent. Therefore, the current level of Soviet industry is already considerably higher than the pre-war level, and even higher than the level stipulated by the Five-Year Plan for 1950. This is a great achievement of our socialist construction. It is important to emphasize that in the regions of the country that had been occupied by the enemy, the pre-war level of industrial output had already been reached in September 1949.

    The measures taken by the government to more effectively utilize production equipment and mobilize the latent reserves of industrial plants have made it possible to increase the industrial output plans originally stipulated in the 1949 plan. Quarter after quarter, these increased plans have been exceeded. The total output of Soviet industries in the first ten months of this year was 20 percent higher than in the same period last year. Large quantities of coal, oil, metal, electricity, chemicals, timber and building materials, machinery, and consumer goods have been produced in excess of the plan.

    Simultaneous with the implementation of the first post-war Five-Year Plan, extensive new industrial construction is also underway. In the first three years and nine months of the post-war Five-Year Plan, more than 4,600 state-owned industrial plants (not including cooperative factories and other small factories) have been restored or newly established and have commenced operations.

    The boundless creative initiative of the Soviet workers and their genuine Bolshevik concern for the development of our national economy have revealed new reserves inherent in socialist industry.

    In the first nine months of 1949, industrial labor productivity increased by 14 percent compared to the same period last year; the raw materials, supplies, fuel, and electricity required for each unit of product have been reduced; the planned reduction of production costs is being realized. In the first nine months of 1949, industrial production costs (at comparable prices) decreased by 7.2 percent.

    The people's patriotic movement to obtain above-plan accumulation, initiated last year by advanced workers, has produced great results. Due to rigorous economy, industry has produced additional products worth more than 2 billion rubles.

    Our socialist agriculture has also made great achievements. In 1948, the total grain harvest had almost reached the level of 1940. This year's harvest has exceeded 1940. Our country's grain problem has been solved, and a solid foundation has been laid for achieving further achievements in this field. All the necessary conditions exist for our socialist agriculture to increase grain production, industrial crop production, and other crop production year by year.

    The government's decision last year stipulated the planting of forest protection belts, the implementation of pasture and crop rotation systems, and the excavation of ponds and reservoirs to ensure bumper harvests year after year. This plan is being implemented victoriously. More than 500,000 hectares of protection belts have been planted, and the area to be planted in 1950 is even larger.

    The number of machines supplied to agriculture is increasing rapidly. Our socialist industry supplies our farms with larger quantities of various agricultural machines every year. In 1949, agriculture will receive a total of 150,000 tractors (each tractor calculated at 15 horsepower), 29,000 combine harvesters, more than 1.6 million tractor-drawn tools, and other agricultural machines. In other words, agriculture will receive a total of three to four times the tractors and machines of the pre-war year of 1940.

    The progress made in grain production has made it possible to address the lagging state of livestock breeding. Livestock breeding is one of the most important sectors of agriculture. The progress and comprehensive development of livestock breeding is now the central task of the Party and the government in the agricultural field. Of historic importance for completing this task is the three-year plan (1949-1951) to increase publicly owned livestock in collective farms and state farms. This plan is stipulated in the April 1949 resolution of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union. This plan stipulates the increase of livestock in the shortest possible time, ensuring that in 1951 the production of meat, fat, butter, eggs, dairy products, and other animal products will be 1.5 times that of 1948, to supply the people. The plan stipulates a large increase in the production of wool, leather, and other raw materials for light industry. This decision, which is being vigorously supported by the male and female members of collective farms and state farms, is being implemented victoriously. In the past year, the cattle in collective farms and state farms have increased by 20 percent, sheep by 13 percent, and pigs by 72 percent.

    The work of state collection of grain and other agricultural products is nearing completion. This year, collective farms and state farms handed over 128 million more poods of grain to the state than last year. The state has also received a large increase in oilseeds, sugar beets, meat, dairy products, and other agricultural products.

    Therefore, we are qualified to say that our industry and agriculture have entered a new period of vigorous expansion, and all this opens up new possibilities for further improving the living standards and cultural levels of the Soviet people.

    Contrary to the capitalist system, socialist economy is unimaginable without the state's daily concern for improving the living standards and cultural levels of the working people - this is its law of development. Due to concern for the step-by-step improvement of the living standards of the working people, the Soviet government lowered the prices of consumer goods after the monetary reform and the abolition of the rationing system at the end of 1947. The price reduction saved the people nearly 86 billion rubles in one year. The continued progress of the Soviet national economy, the increase in the production of consumer goods, and the new achievements made in reducing the cost of manufactured goods made it possible to reduce prices again. Another price reduction was completed on March 1 this year. Due to this reduction in prices in all sectors of retail trade, the people saved nearly 71 billion rubles again this year. The impact of the first and second stages of price reduction has been to increase the purchasing power of the ruble and improve the exchange rate of the Soviet ruble against foreign currencies. The actual income of workers and intellectuals has increased, and the amount of money farmers must pay to purchase industrial goods has decreased.

    The Soviet people are not threatened by "Marshallization," they are not threatened by a reduction in living standards and actual wages, which are the eternal disasters in capitalist countries. The sword of Damocles of poverty and unemployment does not hang over the heads of the Soviet people. On the contrary, in the Soviet state, every worker who is paid according to his labor has every opportunity to improve his living standards.

    Housing construction is being carried out on a large scale. In the first three years and nine months of the post-war Five-Year Plan, state enterprises, institutions, and local Soviets, as well as individuals with the help of the state, have built and renovated more than 61 million square meters of living space in cities and workers' residential areas. During the same period, more than 2 million houses were repaired and newly built in rural areas.

    There has also been great progress in science, culture, and art. In the past few years, the concerted efforts between science and production, and between scientists and advanced workers, engineers, technicians, agriculturalists and collective farmers, have undoubtedly been strengthened. True science, which is closely linked to life, ruthlessly breaks down all outdated legends, does not allow conservatism, adherence to conventions, and indifference to the seedlings of innovation. In socialism, advanced science boldly faces the future. The socialist state creates the most favorable conditions for the development of science. Soviet science is opening up unlimited possibilities for the use of our country's vast resources, and is loyally serving to strengthen our country's power and strength.

    Soviet science works for the cause of peace, for the prosperity of our country. Atomic energy in the hands of imperialists is a means of producing destructive weapons, a means of intimidation, a tool of blackmail and coercion. But in the hands of the Soviet people, it can and should be a powerful tool for technological progress on an unprecedented scale, a tool for further rapidly developing our productive forces.

    With the development of our productive forces, there is the development of the socialist content and national form of our country's culture. The Soviet people cherish and respect art and literature, which use the methods of socialist realism to truthfully reflect our rich, fleshy life, reflecting the intensive, wholehearted labor efforts of the Soviet people - the builders of communism. The Party and the government consistently care about the ideological and artistic progress of literature and art. In the Soviet Union, art and literature serve the people and are organically connected with the people.

    The Soviet people are engaged in great creative work. It is noteworthy that in all aspects of our great socialist construction work, in all sectors of the national economy, in technology and science, the dominant spirit is the pursuit of the advanced, the new, and the progressive. This is one aspect of the great superiority shown by our system itself. We should continue to rely on this spirit of progress, give it all kinds of encouragement, increase and disseminate the progressive reforms of our workers and the excellent examples they have created, and ensure that we all strive to achieve the same achievements as the reformers - these advanced people of the Soviet Union.

    In the Soviet Union, honest work is highly praised and always encouraged. This cannot but be the case in a society where production relations are not based on the principles of exploitation and competition but on the principles of constructive cooperation and socialist competition.

    The Party and the Soviet government have widely adopted a system of rewarding achievements and successes in various sectors of the economy and culture.

    From the end of the Patriotic War in 1945 to 1949, more than 510,000 workers, collective farmers, scientists, engineers, technicians, staff, doctors, teachers, etc., have been awarded Soviet orders and medals for their achievements in industry, transportation, agriculture, science, culture, or art. During this period, 4,800 male and female laborers have been awarded the title of Hero of Socialist Labor for their outstanding achievements in industry and agriculture, and 2,540 science, technology, art, and literature workers have been awarded the lofty title of Stalin Prize laureate.

    The progress of the national economy and the prosperity of socialist culture instill, and will continue to instill, in workers, collective farmers, and intellectuals the ability to create, initiate, and invent. Our country will continue to appropriately reward the achievements of reformers in industry and agriculture, and reward the achievements of scientists and artists who have made great contributions to our material and spiritual culture and promote its glory.

    Undoubtedly, our achievements are great. But Comrade Stalin teaches us that we must be careful not to become arrogant and complacent with the honors we have already achieved. Where there is arrogance, complacency, self-satisfaction, and boasting, there is no Bolshevik spirit of self-discipline and self-criticism, and progress stops, followed inevitably by stagnation.

    Exaggeration is a human weakness. Some comrades among us also suffer from this weakness, and they cannot praise something without getting carried away. They cannot properly estimate achievements while also noticing shortcomings in order to eliminate them, and the scale of our progress depends to a great extent on how resolutely we strive to eliminate the shortcomings in our work. Our Party teaches us to fight relentlessly to eliminate shortcomings.

    Our Party teaches us that a person must honestly admit his mistakes in order to quickly correct them and not repeat them in the future. But some people - just caricatures of staff members - only remember this part of the Party's instructions. They constantly make mistakes in their work, admit their mistakes, and then continue to make them carelessly again. For the sake of our cause, can we not admit that such unlucky staff members who keep making mistakes are an obstacle to our progress?

    The most important thing in the art of leadership in any work is to foresee the various difficulties and obstacles that may hinder and delay development, and to guide efforts to eliminate these difficulties and obstacles in a timely manner, in order to prevent the interruption of work, avoid the danger of stagnation, and ensure that the movement forward continues to advance.

    One of the reasons for the Party's victory is that it skillfully used the method of criticism and self-criticism in its work, corrected mistakes, and thereby educated the cadres.

　　(2) The Soviet Union Persists in Peace and Upholds the Cause of Peace

    Comrades, if you were to ask what is the main thing in our foreign policy, then, in short, it is that the Soviet Union persists in peace and upholds the cause of peace. The Soviet Union unswervingly pursues a policy of peace and international friendship. We do not want war, and we will do everything in our power to prevent war.

    The Soviet Union's policy of peace stems from the foundations of the socialist system and the interests of the Soviet people. We have completely abolished the exploitation of man by man in our country for many years, thereby eliminating the reasons for the policy of exploitation and oppression of other countries in the capitalist world. We have created an unprecedented example in human history of brotherly cooperation between different races and nationalities, thereby forever abandoning the policy of building the happiness of one country on the oppression of other countries. A policy guided by the principle of suppressing the sovereignty of other national states is something we abhor.

    A socialist country does not need to expand outwards. It does not need to engage in colonial plunder. The socialist system in the Soviet Union has eradicated the causes of economic crises, which the rulers of the capitalist world usually try to escape from by gambling on war.

    The imperialists place their hopes on the gamble of war because they are afraid of peaceful competition with socialism. But it is quite clear that the gamble of war will bring nothing but disaster to the imperialists.

    The Soviet people are not afraid of peaceful competition with capitalism. That is why they oppose new wars and defend peace, although they know for certain and firmly believe that their strength cannot be defeated.

    The Soviet people are fully aware of their responsibility to history. They showed this when they stood firm like a solid wall, sparing no effort to save their motherland and all progressive humanity from the attack of the fascist barbarians. They are also showing this in the post-war years, when the well-known imitators of the fascist barbarians are waving the bloody sword of a new war to the whole world.

    Loyal to its steadfast policy of peace, the Soviet government has since the war advocated a program which, if implemented, would greatly strengthen peace and international security. This program includes cooperation among the major powers, disarmament, and the unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons. This program stipulates strict observance of the Potsdam decisions on the German question, stipulates the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan, and expands trade and economic relations between countries.

    If this program has not been implemented, it is only because it has not catered to the appetite of the war profiteers, but the Soviet government has not relaxed its efforts to strengthen peace. The Soviet Union continues to propose condemning the new war preparations being carried out by certain countries, especially the United States and Britain, unconditionally banning atomic weapons, and establishing appropriate international controls.

    The Soviet government recently proposed that the five major powers of the United States, Britain, France, China, and the Soviet Union should conclude a treaty to strengthen peace. And the war profiteers will probably frustrate this proposal.

    Nevertheless, the Soviet Union will continue to fight for the defense of peace with greater efforts. The Soviet people will spare no effort to consolidate and expand the ranks of peace advocates as much as possible and smash the evil plans of the aggressors.

    We are now living in an era in which the movement of the masses for democracy and socialism is becoming stronger day by day, and the camp of peace and democracy has become a powerful factor in all international affairs.

    The scale of mass movements in history has never been greater than this mass movement that unites the international camp of peace advocates. There is no country in the world that does not have a base supporting this movement, or where this movement is not growing and expanding.

    We know that the World Peace Congress was held in Paris and Prague in April this year. Representatives of 561 national groups and 12 international organizations of peace movement advocates against the threat of new war participated in the Congress. The Peace Congress represented a total of 600 million organized peace advocates.

    The Congress vividly showed that the international peace movement is not based on the idea of appeasement - a mixture of verbally negating war and actually taking a completely passive attitude, which is usually the case - but on the firm determination to actively fight the war profiteers and frustrate their treacherous schemes. The Peace Congress called on the people of all countries to participate in the active struggle to defend peace, and gained the broadest response and support in all countries. The people of all countries are no longer passive, they are prepared to actively defend the cause of peace, because the horrors and sacrifices of the most recent war are still fresh in their minds.

    The international peace movement is great and powerful because it unites millions and billions of mental and physical laborers of all races, nationalities, religions, or political opinions under its banner. The peace movement is also powerful because it is developing on a solid organizational basis. This foundation is becoming stronger and stronger. We know that national federations of peace advocates have been established in almost every country in the world. Many of them have held national congresses, which are inspiring demonstrations of the masses' determination to crush the evil schemes of the war profiteers.

    Our country also held a peace congress - the All-Soviet Congress of Peace Advocates. As expected, this Congress showed that our country's struggle to defend peace is not only supported by a section of the Soviet public, but is indeed unanimously supported by the entire Soviet people. The Congress also showed that the Soviet government's policy of peace is supported by the unanimous will of the Soviet people.

    The forces of peace are not only uniting within countries, but also internationally. From this point of view, the importance of the activities of the following peace-supporting organizations cannot be estimated: the World Federation of Trade Unions, which has 70 million workers, the International Democratic Women's Federation, which has 80 million members, the World Federation of Democratic Youth, which has 60 million young workers, farmers, staff, and students, the International Student Union, which has organizations in 54 countries, and many other democratic organizations of peace advocates.

    The call to defend peace is becoming louder and louder, and this powerful mass movement against aggressors and war profiteers and for national independence and peaceful cooperation among nations is also becoming larger and larger. The era in which imperialists could prepare for war in extreme secrecy, and wars would break out suddenly, causing the people of all countries to suddenly find themselves facing the start of hostilities, has passed.

    The powerful peace movement proves that the people have become a force capable of containing the aggressors.

    It is precisely because of these victories of the peace camp that the war profiteers are becoming increasingly frantic. The plans of the main enemies of peace are being exposed more and more every day. This plan plans to use violence and new wars to establish an American world empire, the scale of which will exceed any world empire established by past conquerors. This idea is precisely to turn the entire world into a colony of American imperialism and reduce the autonomous peoples of all countries to the status of slaves.

    How different are these stupid schemes to "Americanize" countries and continents from Hitler and Goering's crazy plans to first "Germanize" Europe and then "Germanize" the whole world? How different are these schemes from Tanaka and Tojo's crazy plans to subjugate all of Asia and the Pacific under Japanese imperialism? In fact, the only difference is that the aggressive plans of these new war instigators have surpassed the joint plans of their German and Japanese predecessors.

    Is this policy of making war not the basis of the notorious "Marshall Plan"? We know that the so-called "aid" allocated to Western European countries under the Marshall Plan amounts to about 4 billion US dollars per year. At the same time, we also see that the main countries of the Marshall Plan, under American pressure, spend more than 6 billion US dollars per year on the arms race and militaristic indulgence. Therefore, one of the main functions of the "Marshall Plan" is actually to accelerate the militarization of the Western European economy.

    The purpose of the North Atlantic Military Treaty signed in 1949 is obvious. It is a direct and open tool for preparing new imperialist wars. One of the most important components of the war profiteers' aggression route is the so-called atomic diplomacy, the adventurousness of which has now been completely exposed. Because, in fact, this diplomacy is based on the absolutely false assumption that only the United States has atomic weapons. We know that the Soviet government did not keep secret the fact that it possessed atomic weapons. In 1947, the Soviet government told the world that the secret of the atomic bomb no longer existed. However, the arrogant war profiteers lack all sense of reality and are still unwilling to give up their dazzling atomic diplomacy.

    We do not want war, and we will do everything in our power to prevent war, but no one should think that we are intimidated by the war profiteers' bluster. It is not us, but the imperialists and aggressors who are afraid of war.

    What does historical experience tell us? It tells us that the result of the First World War launched by the imperialists was the victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution in our country.

    Historical experience also tells us that the result of the Second World War launched by the imperialists was the establishment of people's democratic regimes in many countries in Southeastern Europe, and the victory won by the great Chinese people.

    If the imperialists launch a Third World War, does this mean that not only the demise of individual capitalist countries, but also the demise of the entire capitalist world, is still in any doubt?

    There is also one more thing that must be kept in mind. That is, the era in which war profiteers could deceive the American people into believing that they would not have to make significant sacrifices in the war, and that a large amount of cannon fodder could be found in Europe and Asia, has passed. The American people are beginning to realize that the current imperialists can no longer fight only with the hands of other countries. The American people are beginning to realize that if war profiteers launch a new war, then the sorrow of mothers, wives, and children will also descend on the American continent. And this is a terrible sorrow. War profiteers will inevitably be suffocated and overwhelmed by this sorrow.

　　(3) The Forces of Democratic Peace are Winning

    As the Soviet Union develops and progresses, the forces of democracy and socialism throughout the world are also growing in number and strength.

    In 1949, the People's Democratic countries of Central and Southeastern Europe - Czechoslovakia, Poland, Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, and Albania - are all advancing along the road of building socialism. In a very short period, the masses of the People's Democratic countries have begun to show their active creativity on a large scale. The People's Democratic Republics have entered such a stage, the people who understand the joy of free and independent life, have felt that they are the masters of the country, and are dedicating all their energy to promoting the strength and progress of the country.

    The national economies of the People's Democratic countries are rapidly industrializing on the basis of national plans. The level of pre-war industrial production has been greatly exceeded. Preliminary steps have been taken in the socialist reconstruction of agriculture. The welfare of the people is rising.

    Not long ago, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary were countries of the kind whose workers were constantly flowing abroad. During the period from 1920 to 1939, more than 3 million people from the above countries migrated abroad, and this estimate is still very incomplete. But now, this shameful page has passed. People who were forced to leave their countries in the past are now returning to the embrace of their motherland and joining the ranks of active builders of socialism.

    It is not surprising that the imperialists express "disapproval" of the regimes of the People's Democratic countries. It would be unnatural to expect them to take any other attitude in this regard towards countries where the people hold power and whose national sovereignty is not bought and sold. As the saying goes, if the imperialists were limited to verbal disapproval, it would only be half the trouble. But they do not stop there. They rudely interfere in the internal affairs of the People's Democratic Republics. They carry out criminal, subversive activities against these countries, and for this purpose, they mainly use fascist spies and saboteurs and the Yugoslav gang.

    The trial in Budapest of the espionage central organization of Rajk and his accomplices revealed what the war profiteers and their Yugoslav servants are capable of doing. They are trying to stop the historical progress of the People's Democratic Republics and pave the way for armed imperialist intervention, with the aim of turning these countries into their colonies.

    But at the same time, the Budapest trial showed that the imperialists' subversive conspiracies against the People's Democratic countries are being defeated again and again. The fascist nationalist Tito-Rankovic group has been completely exposed as an imperialist spy agent and is being used by imperialism to carry out hostile actions against the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries. This exposure gave the imperialists' conspiracies a serious blow. Now neither the masters themselves nor their Yugoslav servants can hide themselves, because the masks have been torn off, the conspiracy plans have been exposed, and the criminals have been caught in the act. We can say to them: it will still be the case in the future, because where free and independent people become masters of their own destiny, the conspiracies of the imperialists and their Yugoslav lackeys will be destroyed.

    A special success of the peace and democratic camp is the establishment of the peace-loving German Democratic Republic. This is a fact of first-rate international importance.

    As Comrade Stalin pointed out in his congratulatory telegram to Wilhelm Pieck, President of the German Democratic Republic, and Otto Grotewohl, Prime Minister: "The establishment of the peace-loving German Democratic Republic is a turning point in European history."

    In the past thirty years, Germany has twice appeared on the world stage as an aggressive force, and has twice launched bloody massacres - the First World War and the Second World War. This is the result of German policy being dominated by German imperialists, by aggressive robbers. If now, with the establishment of the peaceful German Democratic Republic, the people's democratic forces advocating lasting peace have the upper hand in Germany, and the aggressive robbers are isolated, then this marks a fundamental transformation of European history. There is no doubt that with the Soviet policy of peace and the German Democratic Republic's policy of peace, with the sympathy and support of the people of all European countries, peace in Europe can be considered guaranteed.

    The establishment of the German Democratic Republic reflects the process of unity and consolidation of the democratic forces of the German people. Unless the German question is properly resolved, peace in Europe, and therefore peace in the world, will not be guaranteed. The German question cannot be resolved unless the democratic forces of Germany take the destiny of the country into their own hands, deprive the economic and political base of the Ruhr tycoons, and implement fundamental democratic reforms in the country.

    The establishment of the German Democratic Republic shows that these urgent conditions for fundamentally solving the German question on a democratic basis have been established in Germany.

    Bearing in mind the responsibility for the future of the motherland and the responsibility for the whole world, the democratic forces of the German people are taking the destiny of their country into their own hands, they are establishing a democratic republic, and are now laying the foundation for a new peace-loving Germany.

    This is in line with the basic national interests of the entire German people. It is fully in line with the decisions of the Potsdam Conference. All peace-loving nations congratulate the German Democratic Republic and will give it sympathy and actively support its noble work.

    Of great importance to the consolidation of the cause of peace is the victory of the Chinese people. The Chinese people have liberated themselves from the long-term tyranny of feudal reactionaries and the shackles of foreign imperialism. Lenin said in 1923: The outcome of the struggle between the capitalist and communist worlds will ultimately depend on the fact that Russia, India, and China account for the vast majority of the world's total population, and this majority is being involved in the struggle for liberation at an extraordinary rate. Due to the victory of the Chinese people, the People's Democratic countries of Europe and Asia, together with the Soviet Socialist countries, have a total population of nearly 800 million. And it should also be kept in mind that hundreds of millions of working people in the capitalist countries themselves and in their colonies are also fighting for peace and democracy.

    American imperialism intends to use China as its main supporting base for ruling Asia and the Pacific, as one of the decisive links in encircling the Soviet Union. For this purpose, the imperialists intended to turn China into a huge colonial appendage of the American world empire. According to extremely incomplete estimates, the United States has spent about 6 billion US dollars supporting the anti-people Kuomintang regime and inciting the flames of civil war in China.

    As early as 1925, Comrade Stalin said: "The strength of the Chinese revolutionary movement is incalculable. This strength has not yet been able to make itself accurately felt by people. But they will definitely make themselves felt in the future. The rulers of the East and the West who do not see this strength and do not give them due consideration will suffer as a result. ... Here, truth and justice are entirely on the side of the Chinese revolution. That is why we now and in the future sympathize with the Chinese revolution, which is carrying out the struggle to liberate the Chinese people from the shackles of imperialism and to unite China into one country. Anyone who does not calculate this strength now and in the future is bound to fail."

    Comrade Stalin's prophecy has been fully confirmed by the development of the situation. The Communist Party of China, tempered in the flames of national liberation struggle and armed with the doctrine of Marxism-Leninism that overcomes all victories, has proved to be able to shoulder its historical mission. Under the leadership of its long-tested and long-tested leader Mao Zedong, it organized and united the workers, peasants, intellectuals, and all patriotic forces in the country. It established a powerful People's Liberation Army, which defeated the Kuomintang gangs equipped with American weapons and actually commanded by American military personnel. The Chinese People's Revolution has proved to be immeasurably stronger than the reactionary aggressive groups of Chinese feudal forces and American imperialists.

    The victory of Chinese democracy not only opened a new chapter in the history of the Chinese people, but also opened a new chapter in the history of the people of Asian countries oppressed by American imperialists. The national liberation struggles of the people of Asia, the Pacific, and the entire colonial world have risen to a new level much higher than in the past. The victory of Chinese democracy means that the position of the world democratic and anti-imperialist camp, which is fighting for lasting peace, has been greatly strengthened.

    Therefore, we can say with confidence that the forces of democracy and socialism are growing, while the forces of capitalism and war profiteers are declining.

    Comparing the situation of the socialist camp with that of the capitalist camp, we cannot but see the following extremely important factors. While the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries are developing vigorously economically, while their economies are constantly rising, in the United States, the signs of economic crisis are becoming more and more numerous. The American government authorities and some official economists are doing everything possible to cover up the truth of the situation and prevent the American people and foreign countries from knowing it. But no one believes this forged optimism. On the contrary, it only increases the panic of the American public, who still clearly remember that after the same assurances made by President Hoover, the unprecedented crisis of

　　莫斯科苏维埃庆祝十月革命节大会上
  　马林科夫报告全文
    【新华社北京七日电】塔斯社莫斯科七日电：马林科夫于一九四九年十一月六日在莫斯科苏维埃举行纪念伟大的十月社会主义革命三十二周年的庆祝大会上所作的报告，全文如下：
    同志们，苏联各民族和我们国外的朋友们正庆祝着伟大的十月社会主义革命的三十二周年。
    苏联人民怀着正当的自豪，注视着他们的斗争和工作的成果。同志们，你们和我所生活着的时代，将作为伟大的斯大林的时代而永垂于我国史册。
    在我国的历史上，居住在其广阔土地上的各民族从来未曾有过如此紧密地团结着。革命前弥漫于我国的民族不和与敌意，早就被所有各民族间的友好和兄弟般的合作所代替了。在苏联各民族的大联盟中，大小民族的创造性的力量已找到了出路。
    我国在她底全部历史中，从来没有象今天这样有着如此公正和秩序井然的国界。看一看地图吧。在西方，乌克兰已把她底所有一切乌克兰人民团聚在一个家庭中。对白俄罗斯和摩尔达维亚边界的历史上的不公正，已经消除了。在西方已不再有许多世纪以来一直是进攻我国之基地的东普鲁士了。往北面看看，新边境已十分安全地划定，而加强了列宁格勒的防卫。在远东，千岛列岛因增进我国的安全而已具有新的意义，同时现在已完全恢复了的库页岛，则在防卫苏联上是作为整个地而不是半个地起着更大的作用。
    在我国全部历史中，她从来没有象今天这样为对我国如此友好的邻国所围绕着。在苏联的边境上，敌视俄罗斯的波兰国家已经不存在了，现在我们有着友好的人民民主的波兰；被希特勒匪帮所肢解的、不久前还呻吟在法西斯侵略者束缚下的捷克斯洛伐克不存在了，我们有着一个友好的人民民主的捷克斯洛伐克；从前作希特勒德国仆从的匈利牙不存在了，我们有着一个友好的匈牙利人民共和国；敌视苏联的罗马尼亚不存在了，我们有着一个友好的罗马尼亚人民共和国；从前是希特勒战争机器附属品的旧保加利亚不存在了，苏联有着保加利亚人民共和国这样一个忠实的朋友。永恒的友谊连系把波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、罗马尼亚及保加利亚等国人民与苏联各民族牢固地团结在一起；在东方，苏联和蒙古人民共和国接壤，我们和她是有多年的友谊连系的；年轻的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国是我们友好的邻国；最后，被外国资本主义掠夺者降为奴隶的中国已经不存在了，现在我们在东方有着一个伟大的友好的邻邦——自由的中华人民共和国。
    在这伟大的十月社会主义革命三十二周年的时候，苏联人民充满不可动摇的信念：我国将继续向着共产主义胜利地前进。在社会主义与资本主义两个制度的巨大竞争中，社会主义制度的优越性是清晰可见的。
    只消回忆一下苏联在自己存在的三十二年期间，经历过了两次紧张的战争考验——一九一八至二○年反对内外敌人的战争和一九四一年至四五年反对纳粹侵略的伟大卫国战争——就足以看出这一点了。另一方面，我们知道资本主义国家中的最强大者——美利坚合众国却几乎是在完全和平的环境中发展了八十多年，在它的经济建设中没有受到任何人的阻挠。这是一件意义不小的事实，这是任何想对社会主义经济制度的成就求得一个公正和客观的判断的人都不应忘记的。
    我国人民深信他们事业的正义性。攫住了群众底心的马克思——列宁主义的学说，已经成为在争取新的战胜旧的斗争中，在争取社会主义战胜资本主义的斗争中的一股巨大的力量。
　　（一）我们正站在走向新胜利的稳固道路上
    当此十月革命三十二周年纪念日，苏联人民在社会主义经济与文化的一切部门中，已经显示了可观的成就。
    自从苏联人民在布尔什维克党的领导之下着手实行第一个斯大林战后五年计划以来，已经有三年零十个月了。抱着对于已经完成了的责任的满意心情，我们现在可以说，我们的国民经济现在不仅已达到了战前水平，而且已经超过了它。我们有一切理由相信，第一个战后五年计划将会先期完成。
    根据五年计划，一九五○年苏联工业总产量要超过战前一九四零年百分之四十八。今年十月份，工业总产量超过了一九四零年每月平均产量百分之五十以上。因此，苏联工业现在的水平已相当地高于战前水平，比五年计划为一九五○年所规定的水平还高。这是我们社会主义建设的巨大成就。强调指出这一点是重要的，即在国内曾遭受敌人占领的地区，在一九四九年九月就已达到了战前的工业产量水平。
    政府为了更有效地利用生产设备并动员工业工厂的潜在后备而采取的措施，已使增加一九四九年计划中原来规定的工业出产计划，成为可能。一季又一季，这些增加了的计划被超过了。本年度头十个月中苏联各工业的总产量较去年同期高百分之二十。大量的煤、石油、金属、电力、化学品、木材与建筑材料、机器及消费品，都已超过计划生产出来。
    与执行第一个战后五年计划同时，广泛的新的工业建设也在进行着。在战后五年计划头三年零九个月中，有四千六百个国营工业工厂（合作社工厂与其他小型工厂尚不计在内），已经恢复或者从新建立并已开工。
    苏联工人无穷尽的创造性的主动性及其对于发展我国国民经济所抱有的真正的布尔什维克的关怀，显示了社会主义工业中所蕴藏的新的后备。
    在一九四九年头九个月中，工业的劳动生产率比去年同期提高百分之十四；每一个单位的产品所需的原料、供应、燃料与电力已经减少；生产成本的有计划的降低正在实现。在一九四九年头九个月中，工业生产成本（按比较价格）减少了百分之七点二。
    在先进工人发起下于去年开始的争取获得超计划积累的人民爱国运动，已经产生了巨大成果。由于厉行节约，工业已生产了价值二十亿卢布以上的额外产品。
    我们的社会主义农业也有了巨大的成就。在一九四八年，谷物总收成已几乎达到了一九四零年的水平。今年的收成则超过了一九四零年。我国的谷物问题业已解决，并奠定了在这一领域中获致进一步成就的坚固基础。使我们社会主义农业逐年增加谷物产量、工业作物与其他作物产量的一切必要条件都存在着。
    当与政府去年所通过的决议，规定了种植森林防护带，实行牧草与作物轮种制，开掘池塘与蓄水池，以保证年年丰收的计划。这一计划正在胜利地执行着。已经种植了五十万公顷以上的防护带，准备在一九五零年种植的面积更为广大。
    供给农业用的机器的数量正在迅速地增加着。我们的社会主义工业每年都以更大量的各种农业机器供应我们的农场。一九四九年，农业将总共得到十五万架拖拉机（每架拖拉机以十五匹马力计算），二万九千部联合收割机，一百六十万余用拖拉机曳引的工具及其他农业机器。换句话说，农业将总共得到为战前一九四零年之三、四倍的拖拉机与机器。
    谷物生产方面所获得的进展，使得着手消灭牲畜饲养方面的落后状态成为可能。牲畜饲养是农业中最重要的部门之一。牲畜饲养的进展与全面发展，现在正是党与政府在农业领域中的中心任务。对于完成这一任务具有历史重要性的是增加集体农场与国家农场中公有牲畜的三年计划（一九四九——一九五一年）。这一计划是联共中央委员会与苏联部长会议一九四九年四月的决议所规定的。这一计划规定在最短期间内增加牲畜，保证在一九五一年时生产相当于一九四八年一倍半的肉类、脂肪、牛油、蛋、乳品及其他动物产品，以供应人民。计划规定大大增加毛、皮革及轻工业的其他原料的生产。为集体农场与国营农场的男女成员所竭力拥护的这一决定，正在胜利地实现着。在过去一年中，集体农场与国营农场的牛增加了百分之二十，羊百分之十三，猪百分之七十二。
    国家收纳谷物与其他农产品的工作正趋于完成。今年，集体农场与国营农场交给国家的谷物比去年多一亿二千八百万普特。国家所得到的油籽、甜菜、肉类、乳品及其他农产品也大为增多。
    因此，我们有资格说，我们的工业与农业已进入了新的大力扩展的时期，这一切都给进一步提高苏联人民生活水平与文化水平打开了新的可能性。
    和资本主义制度相反，没有国家方面对于提高劳动人民生活水平与文化水平的日常关怀，社会主义经济是不能想象的——这是它的发展规律。由于关怀劳动人民生活水平的步步改善，苏联政府在一九四七年年底货币改革与废除配给制以后，降低了消费品的价格。物价的降低，使人民在一年中节省了将近八百六十亿卢布。苏联国民经济的继续进展、消费品产量的增加、及在减低制成品成本上所获得的新成就，使得再次降低物价成为可能。今年三月一日已完成了又一次的降低物价。由于零售贸易一切部门中价格的这一降低，人民在今年又节省了近七百一十亿卢布。物价降低的第一与第二阶段所造成的影响，是提高了卢布的购买力并改善了苏联卢布对外币的汇率。工人与知识分子的实际收入增加了，农民为购买工业品所必须支付的款项减少了。
    苏联人民没有“马歇尔化”的威胁，他们不受生活水平降低与实际工资减低的威胁，而这些乃是资本主义国家中永恒的灾祸。没有达摩克理斯的贫穷与失业之剑悬在苏联人民的头上。相反地，在苏维埃国家里，按劳取值的每一个工人都有一切机会提高他的生活水平。
    房屋建筑正在大规模进行中。在战后五年计划的头三年零九个月中，国家企业、机关与地方苏维埃以及个人在国家的帮助下，已在城市和工人住宅区中建筑了和重修了六千一百万余平方公尺的居住面积。同一时期内，在农村地区修复与新建了二百余万所房屋。
    在科学、文化与艺术方面也已有巨大的进展。过去这几年以来，科学与生产之间，及科学家与先进工人、工程师、技术之间，农业家和集体农民之间的同心协力，无疑地已经加强了。与生活有密切联系的真正的科学，无情地打破了一切陈旧的传说，不容许保守主义、墨守成规和对于革新的幼苗的漠不关心。在社会社会主义里，先进的科学大胆地面对着将来。社会主义国家为发展科学创造着最有利的条件。苏维埃科学正为我国的巨大资源之使用开辟无限的可能性，并为加强我国的威力与力量而忠诚地服务。
    苏维埃科学为和平事业、为我国的繁荣而工作。原子能在帝国主义者手里是生产毁灭性武器的手段，是进行恫吓的手段，是敲诈和威逼的工具。但是，在苏联人民手里，它就能够而且应当是空前规模的技术进步之强大的工具，是进一步迅速发展我国生产力的工具。
    随着我国生产力的发展的，便是我国人民的社会主义内容和民族形式的文化的发展。苏联人民珍爱并尊重艺术与文学，这种艺术与文学运用社会主义现实主义的方法，真实地反映着我国丰富的有血有肉的生活，反映着苏联人民——共产主义的建设者——紧张的全心全意的劳动努力。党和政府一贯地关怀文学与艺术在思想上和艺术上的进步。在苏联，艺术与文学是为人民服务，而且是与人民有机地相连的。
    苏联人民从事于巨大创造性的工作。值得注意的事情是：在我们伟大社会主义的建设性工作的各方面，在国民经济的各部门，在技术与科学当中，占支配地位的精神是追求先进的东西、新的东西和进步的东西。这是我们的制度本身所显示的巨大优越性的一方面。我们应当继续依靠这种进步的精神，给它以各种鼓励，增加并传播我们工人进步的改革和他们所创造的优良的范例，并保证我们大家都努力去达到改革者——这些苏联的先进人民的同样成就。
    在苏联，诚实的工作是被高度赞扬并随时受到鼓励的。在生产关系不是基于剥削和竞争原则上而是基于建设性的同心协力和社会主义竞赛原则上的社会里，不能不是如此。
    党和苏维埃政府广泛采用奖励经济和文化各部门的成就和成绩的制度。
    自从一九四五年爱国战争结束以后直到一九四九年间，已经有五十一万以上的工人、集体农民、科学家、工程师、技师、职员、医生、教师等，因为在工业、运输业、农业、科学、文化或艺术上的成就，而获得了苏联的勋章和奖章。在这个期间内，有四千八百位男女劳动人民因为在工业和农业上的卓越成就而荣获社会主义劳动英雄的称号，有二千五百四十位科学、技术、艺术和文学工作者荣获斯大林奖金获奖人的崇高称号。
    国民经济的进展以及社会主义文化的繁荣，给工人、集体农民和知识分子灌注了并将继续灌注创造、倡议和发明的能力。我们国家将继续适当地奖励工业和农业中的改革者的成绩，奖励对我国物质和精神的文化有巨大贡献并发扬它的光荣的科学家和艺术家的成就。
    无可置辩，我们的成就是巨大的。但是斯大林同志教导我们：我们必须注意不要自大起来，安于既得的荣誉。那里有自大、自满、自得、和自诩，那里就没有布尔什维克律己的和自我批评的精神，而进步就停止，接着不可避免地就是停顿。
    夸大是人类的缺点。我们中间也有些同志吃这个缺点的亏，他们不能称赞一件东西而不感情用事。他们不能恰如其分地估计成绩而同时也注意到缺点，以便加以消除，而我们的成就、我们进步的规模，在很大的程度上是要依靠我们如何坚决地努力消除我们工作中的缺点而定的。我们党教导我们要毫不调和地为消除缺点而斗争。
    我们党教导我们：一个人必须诚实地承认他的错误，以便迅即加以纠正并且在以后不再重犯。但是有一些人——只是工作人员的讽刺画——他们只记得党的这个指示的一部分。他们在工作中不断犯错误，承认错误，然后又继续满不在乎地再犯。为了我们的事业，难道我们还能不承认这样会犯错误的倒霉的工作人员是我们进步的障碍吗？
    任何一项工作中的领导艺术，最重要的是在于预见可能阻碍与延误发展的各种困难与障碍，并适时地指导消除这些困难与障碍的努力，以防止工作的中断，避免停顿的危险，保证前进的运动继续推进。
    党获得胜利的原因之一，在于它熟练地在工作中使用了批评与自我批评的方法，纠正错误，并从而教育干部。
　　（二）苏联坚持和平，维护和平事业
    同志们：如果要问我们的外交政策中主要的东西是什么，那么，简要地说，就是苏联坚持和平，维护和平事业。苏联毫不动摇地推行和平与国际友好的政策。我们不要战争，我们将尽我们的一切力量来防止战争。
    苏联的和平政策是从社会主义制度的根基和苏联人民的利益中产生的。我们在我国已完全废除了多年来的人对人的剥削，从而消除了资本主义世界中的那种引起剥削与压迫其他国家的政策的原因。我们创造了一个人类历史上空前未有的不同种族与民族间兄弟般的合作的范例，从而永远抛开了将一个国家的幸福建筑在对他国的压迫之上的政策。以压制其他民族国家主权为指导原则的政策，是我们所憎恶的。
    社会主义的国家不需要向外扩张。它不需要从事殖民地的掠夺。苏联的社会主义制度根除了引起经济危机的原因，而资本主义世界的统治者则通常力谋用战争的赌博来逃避这种危机。
    帝国主义者把他们的希望寄托在战争的赌博上，因为他们害怕和社会主义进行和平的竞争。但是十分明白，战争的赌博除了灾难之外，什么也不会带给帝国主义者。
    苏联人民并不害怕与资本主义进行和平的竞争。这就是为什么他们反对新战争并保卫和平的原因，虽然他们确定地知道并坚决地相信：他们的力量是不可被战胜的。
    苏联人民充分地意识到他们对于历史的责任。当他们不遗余力地象一座坚固的墙一样屹立起来，拯救他们的祖国及一切进步人类，使免受法西斯野蛮人的攻击时，他们就显出了这一点。在战后年月中，当法西斯野蛮人的著名的模仿者们正向全世界挥舞新战争的血剑时，他们也正在显出这一点来。
    苏联政府忠于其坚定不移的和平政策，自战争以来即拥护一个纲领，这个纲领如果实现，将会大大加强和平与国际安全。这一纲领包括各大国间的合作，裁减军备，与无条件禁止原子武器。这一纲领规定严格遵守关于德国问题的波茨坦决定，规定对日缔结和约，并扩展各国之间的贸易与经济关系。
    如果这个纲领没有付诸实现，那只是因为它并没有投合战争贩子的胃口，但苏联政府却毫不放松她对加强和平的努力。苏联继续建议，谴责若干国家、特别是美国与英国所正在进行的新战争准备，无条件禁止原子武器及建立适当的国际管制。
    苏联政府最近曾提出一项建议，即美、英、法、中、苏五大国应缔结一个加强和平的公约。而战争贩子将可能使这个建议落空。
    虽然如此，苏联仍然将继续以更大的努力为保卫和平而斗争。苏联人民将不遗余力地尽量巩固和扩大和平拥护者的队伍并粉碎侵略者的罪恶计划。
    我们现在正是生活在这样一个时代中，群众争取民主与社会主义的运动一天比一天强大，和平与民主阵营已经成为一切国际事务中的强大因素。
    历史上群众运动的规模，从没有比这个将和平拥护者的国际阵营团结起来的群众运动更巨大的了，世界上没有一个国家没有支持这个运动的基地，或者这个运动不在那里增涨和扩大。
    我们知道：今年四月在巴黎和布拉格举行了世界和平大会。五百六十一个全国性团体和十二个国际性的反对新战争威胁的和平运动拥护者联合组织的代表参加了这个大会。和平大会总共代表了六万万有组织的和平拥护者。
    这个大会生动地表明了：国际和平运动不是基于绥靖主义思想——这种思想通常总是口头上否定战争，而实际上完全采取消极态度，这两个东西的混合体——而是基于要积极对战争贩子斗争、并挫败他们的奸诈计谋的坚定决心。和平大会号召各国人民参加为保卫和平的积极斗争，并在一切国家里获得最广泛的响应和支持。各国人民不再抱消极态度了，他们准备积极保卫和平事业，因为最近一次战争的恐怖和牺牲，对于他们仍然记忆犹新。
    国际和平运动之所以伟大和强有力，乃是由于在它的旗帜之下团结了不分种族、国籍、宗教或政治见解的千百万亿智力和体力劳动者。和平运动之所以强有力，还由于它是在一个巩固的组织基础上发展着的。这个基础正愈来愈强固。我们知道，世界上几乎每个国家都已经成立了全国性的和平拥护者联合会。它们之中有许多已经举行了全国代表大会，这些大会是群众决心粉碎战争贩子罪恶阴谋的动人心魄的示威。
    我国也举行了和平大会——全苏拥护和平大会。如所预料，这个大会表明了我国保卫和平的斗争，不是仅仅获得一部分苏联公众的拥护，而是确确实实地获得苏联全体人民的一致拥护，大会还表明了苏联政府的和平政策是受苏联全国人民的一致意志的支持的。
    和平力量不但正在一国范围内团结着，而且也正在国际范围内团结着。从这一观点来看，下列拥护和平组织的活动的重要性，就无法估计了：这些组织就是拥有七千万工人的世界工联，拥有八千万会员的国际民主妇联，拥有六千万青年工人、农民、职员和学生的世界民主青联，在五十四个国家当中有其组织的世界学联，以及和平拥护者的其他许多民主组织。
    保卫和平的呼声起来越响亮，反对侵略者与战争贩子、争取民族独立与各民族间和平合作的这个强大的群众运动，也起来越扩大了。帝国主义者能够极端秘密地准备战争的时代，战争会突然爆发、致使各族人民突然发觉自己已面对着敌对行动业已开始的时代，已经过去了。
    声势浩大的和平运动，证明人民已成为能够遏制侵略者的一种力量。
    正是因为和平阵营这些胜利，战争贩子们日益疯狂。和平的主要敌人的计划，一天比一天更加暴露了。这个计划预定以暴力与新战争来建立美利坚世界帝国，其规模将超过过去征服者们所建立起来的任何世界帝国。这一念头正是一点不差地要把整个世界变为美帝国主义者的殖民地，把自主的各族人民沦为奴隶的地位。
    这些使各国与各洲“美国化”的愚蠢计谋，和希特勒与戈林的首先使欧洲“日耳曼化”，然后使全世界“日耳曼化”的疯狂计划，有什么两样呢？这些计谋，和田中与东条使全亚洲与太平洋屈服于日本帝国主义者之下的那些疯狂的计划，又有什么两样呢？实际上，所不同的只是在于这些新战争挑拨者的侵略计划，已超过了他们的德国与日本先辈们的联合计划。
    这个制造战争的政策不是声名狼籍的“马歇尔计划”的基础吗？我们知道拨给马歇尔计划下的西欧国家的所谓“援助”每年数达四十亿美元左右。同时我们还看到，马歇尔计划的主要国家在美国压力下，在军备竞赛和军国主义的纵欲上，每年还支出六十多亿元。因此，“马歇尔计划”的主要功能之一实际上是加速西欧经济的军事化。
    一九四九年签订的北大西洋军事公约的目的是显而易见的。它是直接地和公然地准备帝国主义新战争的工具。战争贩子侵略路线最重要的构成部分之一就是所谓原子外交，它的冒险性现在已经完全暴露出来了。因为，实际上这种外交是以只美国有原子武器这一绝对虚妄的首要假定为基础的。我们知道：苏联政府并没有保守它拥有原子武器的秘密。在一九四七年，苏联政府就告诉了世界：原子弹秘密不复存在了。可是，傲慢的战争贩子缺乏一切现实感觉，现在还不肯放弃他们眩耀的原子外交。
    我们不要战争，而且我们将尽一切力量来防止战争，但任何人都不要以为我们为战争贩子的虚张声势所吓倒了。不是我们，而是帝国主义者和侵略者才害怕战争。
    历史的经验告诉了我们什么呢？它告诉我们：帝国主义者所发动的第一次世界大战的结果，是我国获得了伟大的十月社会主义革命的胜利。
    历史的经验还告诉我们：帝国主义者所发动的第二次世界大战的结果，是东南欧许多国家中建立了人民民主政权，是伟大的中国人民赢得了胜利。
    如果帝国主义者发动第三次世界大战，这就意味着不但个别资本主义国家的灭亡，而且意味整个资本主义世界的灭亡，这一点还能有任何的怀疑吗？
    另外还有一件事情必须牢记的。就是战争贩子能够欺骗美国人民使他们相信在战争中他们无需作重大的牺牲，相信在欧洲和亚洲可以找到大量炮灰的时代已经过去了。美国的人民正开始了解到目前帝国主义者已不能只借其他国家的手来作战。美国人民正在开始了解到：如果战争贩子发动新战争，那么母亲、妻子和儿女的哀伤也将降临美洲大陆。而这是一个可怕的哀伤。战争贩子不可避免地将为这种哀伤所窒息和淹没。
  　（三）民主和平的力量正赢得胜利
    随着苏联的发展与进步，全世界民主与社会主义的力量在数量与力量上也在增长。
    一九四九年，中欧与东南欧的人民民主国家——捷克斯洛伐克、波兰、保加利亚、匈牙利、罗马尼亚和阿尔巴尼亚——都沿着建设社会主义的道路前进。很短的时间内，人民民主国家的群众就已经开始大规模表现出他们的主动的创造性。各人民民主共和国业已进入这样的阶段，懂得了自由与独立生活之快乐的人民，已感觉到他们自己是国家的主人，正把他们的全部精力奉献于促进国家的强盛与进步。
    人民民主国家的国民经济，正在国家计划的基础上迅速工业化。战前工业生产的水平已被大大超过。农业的社会主义的重建，已采取了初步步骤。人民的福利正在上升。
    在不久以前，波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚、保加利亚和匈牙利等国还是属于这一类国家，其工人不断地流往国外。在一九二零年到一九三九年这个期间，上述各国有三百万余人移往国外，这个估计还是很不完全的。而现在，这可耻的一页已经过去了。过去被迫离开他们的国家的人们，现在正在重返祖国的怀抱，参加社会主义的积极建设者的队伍。
    帝国主义者表示“不赞同”人民民主国家的政权，这是不足为奇的。指望他们对那些由人民握权、且其国家主权不被买卖的国家，在这方面采取任何别种态度，那倒是不自然的了。俗语说得好，假若帝国主义者们只限于口头上的不赞同，那将只有一半麻烦。但是他们并不止于此。他们竟无礼貌地干涉人民民主共和国的内政。他们对这些国家进行罪恶的、颠覆性的活动，为达此目的，主要是利用法西斯间谍和破坏者南斯拉夫匪帮。
    在布达佩斯举行的对拉伊克及其同谋者谍报中央组织的审判，揭露出战争贩子和他们的南斯拉夫从仆是什么事都做得出来的。他们正试图阻止各人民民主共和国历史性的进展，为帝国主义的武装干涉铺平道路，其目的在于把这些国家变为他们的殖民地。
    但同时，布达佩斯审判表示出帝国主义对人民民主国家的颠覆性阴谋正一次又一次地遭受失败。法西斯民族主义者的铁托——兰科维奇集团，已完全被暴露出他们原是帝国主义的间谍代理人，并为帝国主义利用来进行反对苏联和人民民主国家的敌对行动。此一暴露给与帝国主义的阴谋诡计以一严重的打击。现在不论是主子们自己或者是他们的南斯拉夫奴仆，都不能掩饰自己了，因为假面具已经被撕破了，阴谋计划已暴露无遗，罪犯们被当场捉住了。我们可以对他们说：将来也仍然会是如此的，因为在自由与独立的人民成为他们自己命运的主人的地方，帝国主义者和他们南斯拉夫的走狗们的阴谋必遭破灭。
    和平民主阵营的一个特殊的成功，就是爱好和平的德意志民主共和国的建立。这是一件具有头等国际重要性的事实。
    正如斯大林同志在致德意志民主共和国总统威廉·皮克和总理奥托·格罗提渥的贺电中所指出的：“爱好和平的德意志民主共和国的建立，是欧洲历史的转折点。”
    在过去三十年中，德国曾两度作为侵略势力出现于世界舞台，并且两次发动了流血的大屠杀——第一次世界大战和第二次世界大战。这是德国政策受德国帝国主义者、受侵略强盗们支配的结果。如果现在随着和平的德意志民主共和国的成立，拥护持久和平的人民民主力量在德国占了优势，侵略的强盗们被孤立起来，那么，这就标志着欧洲历史的根本转变。毫无疑问，有了欧洲各国人民同情和支持的苏联和平政策和德意志民主共和国的和平政策，欧洲的和平，可以认为是有了保证。
    德意志民主共和国的成立，反映出德国人民民主力量团结和巩固的进程。除非德国的问题得到适当的解决，欧洲的和平、从而世界的和平，是不会有保障的。除非德国的民主力量把国家的命运掌握在他们自己的手里，剥夺鲁尔大亨们的经济和政治的基地，并且在国内实行根本的民主改革，德国问题就不可能得到解决。
    德意志民主共和国的建立，表明在民主基础上根本解决德国问题的这些紧要条件，业已在德国建立了。
    德国人民民主力量本着对于祖国将来的责任感，对于全世界的责任感，正在将他们国家的命运掌握到他们自己的手里。他们建立了一个民主共和国，现正在奠定一个新的爱好和平的德国的基础。
    这正符合于德国全体人民的基本民族利益。它完全符合波茨坦会议的决定。所有爱好和平的民族，都庆贺德意志民主共和国，并将给它以同情，积极支持它崇高的工作。
    对于巩固和平事业有巨大重要性的，是中国人民的胜利。中国人民已从长期的封建反动派的暴政与外国帝国主义的枷锁下解放了他们自己。列宁在一九二三年曾说过：资本主义与共产主义世界间斗争的结果，归根结底将取决于这样一个事实，即俄罗斯、印度与中国占世界总人口的绝大多数，而这一大多数正以非常的速度卷入争取解放的斗争中。由于中国人民的胜利，欧亚人民民主国家与苏维埃社会主义国家一起，共拥有人口将近八万万。并且还应牢记：在资本主义国家本国及其殖民地内，还有数万万劳动人民也在为和平与民主而斗争。
    美国帝国主义打算利用中国作为其统治亚洲及太平洋的主要支撑基地，作为包围苏联的决定性环节之一。为此目的，帝国主义者曾打算将中国变为美利坚世界帝国的一个巨大的殖民地附庸。据极不完全的估计，美国已化了约六十亿美元于支持反人民的国民党政权并煽起中国内战战火。
    早在一九二五年，斯大林同志就说过：“中国革命运动的力量是不可计量的。这种力量还没有能使它自己确当地为人感觉出来。但是它们定会在将来使它自己被人感觉出来。看不到这种力量以及不给它们以应有估计的东方和西方的统治者们，将要因此吃苦头。………这里，公理和正义完全是在中国革命一方面的。这就是为什么我们现在和将来都同情中国革命的缘故，这个革命正在进行着从帝国主义桎梏下解放中国人民并统一中国为一个国家的斗争。谁要是在现在和将来不计算到这一力量，谁就一定要失败。”
    斯大林同志的预言已经被情势的发展所充分证实了。在民族解放斗争的烈火中百炼成钢的，并且以战胜一切的马克思列宁主义学说武装了的中国共产党，已经证明能担当得起它的历史使命。在它的久经锻炼和久经考验的领袖毛泽东的领导之下，它组织了和团结了工人、农民、知识分子和国内一切爱国力量。它建立了一支强大的人民解放军，这支军队击溃了装备着美国武器并且实际上是由美国军事人员所指挥的国民党匪帮。中国人民革命已经证明比中国封建势力与美国帝国主义者的反动侵略集团要强大得不可计量。
    中国民主的胜利不仅揭开了中国人民历史的新的一章，并且揭开了受美帝国主义者压迫的亚洲各国人民历史的新的一章。亚洲、太平洋和整个殖民地世界的人民的民族解放斗争，已经上升到一个新的远较过去为高的水平。中国民主的胜利，意味着正在为持久和平而斗争的世界民主反帝阵营的地位大大地加强了。
    因之，我们可以具有信心地说，民主和社会主义的力量正在增长，而资本主义和战争贩子的力量则正在下降。
    将社会主义阵营与资本主义阵营的状况作一比较，我们就不能不看到下述极重要的因素。当苏联和人民民主国家在经济上蒸蒸日上地发展，当他们的经济不断高涨的时候，在美国，经济危机爆发的征候正愈来愈多。美国政府当局和某些官方经济学家用尽一切办法来掩盖事态的真相，不让美国人民和外国知道它。但是没有一个人相信这种伪造的乐观运动。相反地，它只是增加美国公众的惊慌，他们还清楚记得在胡佛总统所作的同样保证之后，就发生了一九二九年至一九三三年的空前大危机。
    经济危机的征候是掩饰不了的。美国的工业产量自去年秋季以来即在节节下降。在一九四九年七月，工业产量只有战时最高峰的百分之六十五，比一九四八年十月低百分之十八。从一九四八年十月到一九四九年七月，钢产量下降了百分之二十八，机器下降了百分之二十一，非铁金属下降了百分之三十二，纺织品下降了百分之二十七。而在八月份与九月份，生产指数在细微的季节性上涨之后，随着十月份，工业产量就下降得更多。根据官方十月份的数字：美国的工业产量下降了百分之十一以上。这表示从一九四八年十月到一九四九年十月，美国的工业产量下降了百分之二十二。
    如果将一九二九年——一九三三年经济危机开始时工业产量的曲线与一九四八年——一九四九的曲线比较一下，就可以看出：在一九二九年——一九三三年危机的第一年，工业产量下降了百分之十五，而在一九四八年十月开始的这一年，工业产量却下降了百分之二十二。
    尽管有许多垄断资本家宁愿减缩生产而不肯降低价格，然而股票牌价和轻重工业产品的批发价格，却已经在下跌。工业股票价格正在波动与下跌。零售贸易正在缩减。商品存货正在增加。美国的输出已比一九四七年上半年输出额达到最高峰时，跌了百分之十九。
    根据官方数字，美国在过去一年中完全失业的人数已增加了一倍，完全失业与半失业者（只工作部分时间）的数目，超过了一千四百万人。事实上，正如美国工会所断定的，美国失业者的数目，要比官方统计所宣布的大得多。
    附带说一句，目前美国危机的特色之一是，它正是在这样的时候发展着的，这时美国垄断资本家实际上已使资本主义世界的全部经济为他们服务。他们借“马歇尔计划”之助，人为地销售了那些在国内找不到销路的商品，他们又通过所谓武装外国的计划，人为地使若干工业部门得到定货。
    然而，结果怎样呢？美国统治集团绝未能使美国经济免遭正在成熟中的危机。他们尽力把危机所造成的损害转嫁于马歇尔化国家的肩上。应当记住，欧洲各资本主义国家的经济，正处在真正的衰退状态之中。当苏联工业生产在过去二十年中增加至九倍时，资本主义欧洲二十年来的工业生产，整个地说来，却仍停留在同一水平上。
    资本主义世界的国际经济联系遭到深刻的分裂。世界贸易处在低于二十余年前的水平上。通货陷入了通货膨胀的压力中，而货币的购买力则在急遽减低。大众的生活水平继续迅速下降。今日资本主义世界的失业和半失业者不下于四千万人。
    在这些情况下，美国对于那些马歇尔化的国家已经解体的经济的强大攻击，使它们面临着充满了阴霾的前景。最近的几乎所有资本主义国家的通货贬值，可作为美帝国主义经济侵略的一个生动的例子。既然美国的垄断资本已经人为地将他们资本主义“伙伴”们的国家通货对美元的比值贬低，他们便是意图在西欧以及各殖民地国家中加速投资。这只能意味着一件事情，那就是：美国的垄断资本家正企图用贱价买光西欧各国所有各工业部门，并且另外还染指欧洲国家的殖民地。同时，此次贬值标志着美国垄断资本及其西欧伙伴们对劳动群众生活水平的新的进攻。
    因此可以说：世界情势是这样，那些不用美国“援助”而生存的国家和民族的情况却很好，而且我们确信：随着时间的前进，这些国家和民族的情况将会更好起来。另一方面，美国的事务，和美国正予以“援助”的那些国家的事务，则正在每况愈下。
    在这种情形下，帝国主义阵营感到惊惶失措，帝国主义阵营中某些更凶恶的家伙暴跳如雷，并加紧他们的破坏政策，反对那些拒绝在美国亿万富豪面前屈膝的那些国家就不足为怪了。
    同志们！自从地球上六分之一的土地开始了人类历史上一个新纪元的那个可庆贺的日子到现在，差不多有一世纪的三分之一的时间已经过去了。
    今天，我们苏联人民以特别自豪的心情回顾我们的党和我们的人民在列宁与斯大林领导之下所作的那些划时代的伟绩。
    伟大的十月社会主义革命在我们光荣的布尔什维克党的伟绩里，在苏维埃国度光荣的人民的伟绩里生存和胜利。在我们向共产主义前进中，推动和指导的力量是我们的共产党，党团结着、鼓舞着和组织着苏联人民，结合着他们的努力，以达到建设共产主义社会这一伟大的目标。党和人民有生命的联系，一天比一天地更加强固。党的无敌力量和苏维埃国家威力的泉源，就在这里，我们的党是一个团结的、钢铁般牢固的、不可战胜的力量，前所未有地团结在中央委员会的周围，团结在斯大林同志的周围。布尔什维克队伍的这种团结，曾经一贯是而且将来还是我们党的力量的基础。
    伟大的十月革命，它那为各民族之间的和平而斗争的思想，为消灭人剥削人而斗争的思想，为各民族之间平等与友好而斗争的思想，在所有人民民主国家现在所展开的社会主义建设中，在伟大的中国人民具有历史意义的高涨中，在爱好和平的德意志民主共和国的奠立与巩固中，生存和胜利。
    伟大的十月革命，在和平、民主与社会主义拥护者的强大阵线对帝国主义侵略力量、对新战争挑拨者所正在进行的斗争中生存和胜利。
    让那些注定要灭亡的人、那些被历史定罪的人暴跳如雷罢！战争贩子的阵营狂怒得越厉害，我们和平阵营就应当越加镇静与稳重。我们在我们的导师与领袖、天才的斯大林同志的领导下，满怀信心地面对着明天。我们完全清楚：社会主义与民主的世界性的胜利，是不可避免的。
    伟大的十月社会主义革命及其不可战胜的旗帜万岁！
    我们的共产党万岁！
    世界和平万岁！（附图片）
