    ——Harbin Dispatch

    During the celebration of the 32nd anniversary of the October Revolution, railway workers from all over Northeast China held an amateur drama competition in Harbin. A total of thirteen programs were performed, including operas, plays, yangge operas, and new shadow plays, in various forms, which was very lively. These plays were all written and performed by the workers themselves. They were selected from competitions held in the Shenyang, Jilin, Harbin, and Qiqihar Railway Bureaus to participate in this conference. Accepting the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, breaking conservative ideas, and improving technology and production are important links in the construction of Northeast China. On the stage, the workers used their unparalleled enthusiasm to sing about labor and express these themes to the fullest.

    The three plays that won the excellent awards included two that sang about Sino-Soviet friendship, and one about the "Iron Ox" movement currently underway on the railways of Northeast China.

    The first play, called "Who Are Our Friends," was collectively created and performed by the Harbin Railway Factory. The content tells the story of a worker with a vague understanding who held some prejudice against the Soviet Union, opposed learning Russian, and was dissatisfied with the Soviet co-workers in the factory. Later, he discovered that the copper sleeves poured by the foundry were particularly good, precisely because of the Soviet technical guidance; and once, during a rush production, the electric roller mixed up the wires, and he couldn't find the wire end, and he was very anxious, but thanks to the help of the Soviet comrades, he found the problem and completed the task on time. The play used many vivid and specific facts to express the precious friendship of the Soviet Union. In addition to Chinese workers, several Soviet comrades also participated in the performance. They didn't understand much Chinese, but they had to speak Chinese on stage, so they spelled out all the lines with Russian letters, memorized them by heart, and performed them very naturally. Because of the joint performance of China and the Soviet Union, the atmosphere on the stage appeared cheerful, bright, and vividly set off the unity and friendship of the two great nations, showing unparalleled strength.

    Another play singing the same theme was performed by the "Shenyang Central Cultural Troupe" in the form of a new shadow play. A man and a woman stood on the left and right sides of the shadow play, both dressed as street performers from Shandong, singing and reciting the content of the shadow play, and the two of them also performed the play. The performance and lyrics were lively and fresh, full of moving local flavor. Bringing forth the new from the old shows the workers' talent for creating art.

    Why does Chairman Mao tell us to lean to one side? These plays have made the most vivid explanation.

    The "Iron Ox Joint Group" is a collective creation movement of the Suihua Locomotive Depot. The so-called Iron Ox is the production competition movement on the railways of Northeast China. No matter if you are locomotive, car, engineering, or electrical affairs, you must break the old set of conservative ideas, give full play to creativity, and improve work efficiency. In this competition, many plays were closely related to the current movement, but the "Iron Ox Joint Group" was the most outstanding. The play featured several people from different departments vying for credit in the Iron Ox movement, and they were at odds with each other. Later, they recognized their respective deviations and embarked on mutual collaboration. However, in the joint effort, the Iron Ox movement should still be dominated by locomotive and car affairs, but the play put all departments on an equal footing, without distinguishing between major and minor, mixing them together. This is a shortcoming. The responsible comrades of the Northeast Railway General Bureau believed that it was precisely this shortcoming that truly reflected the shortcomings of the work below, and also reflected the lack of clear guidance from the leadership on this movement. The movement itself did not clarify this point, and the play naturally exposed this shortcoming. Therefore, this play turned into the best criticism, drawing the attention of the leadership.

    During the competition, many outstanding talents were also discovered. For example, Tang Shiqing, a stoker from the Mudanjiang Locomotive Depot, was able to write and perform a yangge opera called "Sino-Soviet Friendship" by himself, winning the second prize. He herded cattle since he was a child, and he didn't study much, but he could write and sing many plays. There was also a young worker from the Qiqihar Administration named Pan Xiuyun, who was only seventeen years old, and has now written twelve scripts and performed eleven of them. This time, two of them participated in the competition. Today, under the new national system, the working people are not only giving full play to their creative talents in production and construction, but also showing amazing creativity in the field of art. Among the 160,000 railway employees and workers in the Northeast, there are more than 1,080 amateur theater groups in various places, which has greatly promoted the workers' literary and artistic movement.

    In the competition theater, there were several slogans hanging: "Welcome the high tide of culture with the high tide of production!" In fact, the cultural movement of Northeast railway workers, which is moving towards a high tide, is already stimulating the high tide of production.

    ——哈尔滨通讯
    杨朔
    庆祝十月革命三十二周年的节日里，全东北铁路职工在哈尔滨举行了一次业余戏剧比赛，一共演出十三个节目，有歌剧、话剧、秧歌剧、新洋片等等，形形色色，十分热闹。这些戏都是工人们自己写的，自己演的，事先在沈阳、吉林、哈尔滨、齐齐哈尔各铁路局经过比赛，挑出来参加这次大会。接受苏联的先进经验，打破保守观念，提高技术和生产，是东北建设事业上的一个重要环节。在舞台上，工人们用他们无比的热情，尽情地歌唱着劳动，表现了这些主题。
    获得优等奖的三个戏便有两个是歌唱中苏友好，一个是关于目前东北铁路上正在开展的铁牛运动的。
    第一个戏叫“谁是咱们的朋友”，由哈尔滨铁路工厂集体创作和演出。内容叙说一个认识模糊的工人对苏联抱着点偏见，反对学俄文，不满意厂内的苏联工友，后来发现翻砂厂倒的铜套特别好，正是由于苏联的技术指导；又有一次突击生产中，电滚子混了线，找不着线头，焦急万分，幸亏苏联同志的帮助才找到毛病，按时完成任务。戏里全用许多生动具体的事实表现了苏联的可贵的友情。参加演出的除了中国工人外，还有几个苏联同志。他们不大懂中文，在舞台上却要说中国话，就用俄文字母把台词全拼出来，硬记熟了，演的也很自然。由于中苏共同演出，舞台上的气氛显得愉快，明朗，活生生地烘托出两个伟大民族的团结友爱，显示出无比的力量。
    另一个歌唱同样主题的戏是“沈阳中心文工团”用新洋片的形式演出的。洋片的左右站着一男一女，全是跑江湖艺人的打扮，山东口音，说唱着洋片的内容，两个人也就做起戏来。表演、歌词，又活泼、又新鲜，充满动人的风土气味。推陈出新，足见工人们创造艺术的才能。
    为什么毛主席告诉我们要一边倒？这些戏都做了最生动的说明。
    “铁牛联合组”是绥化机务段的集体创作运动。所谓铁牛，就是东北铁路上的生产竞赛运动。不管你是机务、车务、工务、电务等等，都要打破旧的一套保守思想，发挥创造，提高工作效能。在这次比赛中，不少戏都和当前这一运动扣得紧紧的，但以“铁牛联合组”最出色。戏里出现了几个不同部门的人在铁牛运动中互相争功，相持不下，后来认识了各自的偏差，走上互相联合。但在联合中，铁牛运动还是应该以机务、车务为主，戏里却把各部门平列起来，不分主要和次要，混为一谈，这是个缺点。东北铁路总局的负责同志却认为正是这一缺点，才真实反映了下边工作的缺点，也反映了领导上对这一运动指导的不够明确。运动本身没闹清这一点，戏里自自然然暴露了这个缺点。因此，这出戏倒变成最好的批评，提起了领导上的注意。
    比赛当中，也发现了不少杰出的人才。譬如说牡丹江机务段的司炉唐士青，就能自编自演一出叫“中苏友好”的秧歌剧，得到二等奖。他从小放牛，也没念什么书，却能编唱不少戏。还有齐齐哈尔管理局一个叫潘秀运的小工人，才十七岁，到现在已经写了十二个剧本，演出了十一个，这回就有两个参加了比赛。今天在新的国家制度下，劳动人民不但在生产建设上发挥了创造的才能，就是在艺术的领域里，也显出了可惊的创造性。全东北十六万铁路员、工，各地的业余剧团竟有一千零八十多个，大大推动了工人的文艺运动。
    比赛的剧场里挂着这样几句标语：“以生产的高潮，迎接文化的高潮！”实际上，走向高潮的东北铁路工人的文化运动，已经在刺激着生产的高潮了。
