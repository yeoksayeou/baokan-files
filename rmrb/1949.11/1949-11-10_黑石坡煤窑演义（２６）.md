　　Twenty-Three: Hardship

    Let's return to the story of Da San. After he left, he continued to dig and carry coal around the coal mines near Mount Fuji West, eking out a living. However, he inevitably encountered mine managers and foremen who lacked skill and didn't properly manage the mines. When he couldn't bear it any longer, he would say a few words and have a fight with them, then leave! He'd find another place. He also ran into some good old partners and made a few new friends. When they drank together and talked, they all sighed about the lack of skill and the dullness of the work. Once, Da San even met his old friend Lao Bai. Lao Bai was much thinner than before, and he talked more, but he was just a carrier. Da San asked Lao Bai, "With your good temper and skill, why haven't you become a foreman? You have so many children, isn't it hard to make enough to feed them?" Lao Bai said, "Buddy, don't you know? Nowadays, even kids picking up coal scraps at the mine need connections. What do I have to rely on? Are you afraid I don't have enough to eat? Humph! In these two years, I'm still the same. Last year, my family had a bad harvest, and the landlord took away our pot and locked the door. Two of my three kids died of illness, leaving fewer mouths to feed. Isn't that good luck? Hah! Damn it, I've seen through this world! Buddy, you were right! Let's go have a drink!" Da San was shocked, feeling that this wasn't the same Lao Bai he knew! He went with him to a small restaurant, wanting to have a good heart-to-heart, but Lao Bai hadn't even drunk an ounce of wine before his face turned red, and he leaned against the wall, silently as before, just staring at Da San with eyes that seemed to be holding back tears.

    Da San lowered his head, a wave of sadness washing over him, and he couldn't say anything more. They stayed together for a few days. Lao Bai's wife fell ill, and Lao Bai went back to the mountains to take care of her, never to return. Soon, the Japanese devils invaded Shanxi, the mines stopped working, and Da San didn't know how the world was changing. He ran around with friends for two days and saw that the Japanese had occupied the mine, calling for miners to work. The work became even more unbearable than before! Damn it, the Japanese supervisors sent to the mine ran around everywhere, kicking anyone they didn't like, cursing, "Baga!" and slapping them, saying, "Sanbingu!" The Japanese devils pointed at you, saying a bunch of nonsense that you couldn't understand, and they would get angry, beat you, and fine you. The Japanese devils also made fun of the miners at will: you'd be lying down digging coal, and they'd move a big piece of coal to press on your leg, not letting you move, laughing heartily on the side; you'd be working, and they'd blow out your oil lamp, leaving you in darkness, and they'd laugh and leave. Were they treating Chinese people like human beings? The miners had no choice but to endure it in order to eat. Some endured it, while others took the opportunity to play a trick on the Japanese, bowing to them and laughing, saying, "Damn it! Haha, big, big!" to vent their anger. But Da San couldn't bear it, and he didn't have the mind to make fun of them to vent his anger. He was burning with rage! Once, he was lying down digging coal when a Japanese suddenly stood on his leg, smiling at him, "You! Big, big, good people!" This added fuel to the fire! He flipped over, knocking the Japanese down, and he quickly got up and went through several tunnels, slowly making his way out of the mine, then left! He found another place. But it was the same everywhere! Sometimes he'd run into a few friends, and they'd all say, "This life as a subjugated people is unbearable!" Everyone shook their heads and sighed. They'd pool their money to buy wine, but they couldn't even drink it. They talked about the old partners from the past, always saying who had died, who was missing, and the young ones who had been conscripted into the Japanese army… People dispersed, spirits dampened!

　　Twenty-Four: Trouble

    Soon, the Japanese devils suddenly started saying that the place was a "Land of Paradise" and shouting everywhere to recruit workers. Once, Da San had been resting for more than half a month. Life was really unbearable, and he ran into the Japanese wanting miners to go to Datong, saying how good the "paradise" was in Datong, with wages paid in rice, flour, salt, matches, and cloth, and also giving money, seeming like you could earn a lot. Da San followed a group of workers. Two of the workers pointed at Da San and told the Japanese, "Him, a big, big good worker!" The Japanese patted Da San on the shoulder and said, "Work hard! The Imperial Army welcomes you!" and let Da San be a "small foreman," which was originally just a leading role. But Da San saw that the "big foremen" and other small foremen mostly lacked skill and were only good at licking the boots of the Japanese. When opening accounts and distributing wages, the big and small foremen all took a cut, and the miners couldn't get much money. There were two foremen who really had some skill, but they mostly just followed the other foremen in their nonsense. Moreover, since Da San became a small foreman, the other foremen inevitably pulled him along to invite the Japanese to eat, drink, and find women. He didn't go. Two of the foremen even tried to persuade him several times, telling him to be more accommodating in these times, but he didn't listen. People slowly became cold towards him, and some even looked for his faults and argued with him! After a short time, he packed his bedding and left again.

　　二十三　苦难
    这里再说大三自从走了以后，还是在府西山左近煤窑刨炭担炭混吃喝；但他总还是短不了碰到些不讲把式、不往好里打整窑的领岔领事们，他弯不住了就说两句，跟人家闹一场，走！再换个地势。他也碰到些往日的好伙计，也新交结上几个朋友，大家喝上酒说起话，也都是叹息把式没用，营生没劲。有一回，大三还碰见了往日那个朋友老白，只见老白比过去瘦得多，说话倒比过去多些，但也只是当个担头；大三问老白道：“凭你这好脾性好把式，你也闹不上个领岔的？你孩孩娃娃一大堆，挣这两个就够吃？”老白道：“伙计，你还不知道？这如今连孩孩们上窑上拾个炭渣也得有门子的，你说我凭什么？你怕我不够吃？嗯！这二年我倒还是个我，我家里去年年景不强，没收下，让财主拔了锅锁了门子，三个孩病死了俩，少几口嘴吃饭了，这不是走运么？嗨！＠他妈的，我也看透这世道了！伙计，还是你对！走，喝两盅去！”大三大吃一惊，觉着这不是往日那个老白了！就跟他进了个小饭馆，想痛快捣拉两句；但老白没喝上一两酒，就一脸通红，靠着墙，还象过去那样一声不啃，光瞪着眼听大三说话，眼里红红地象包了一包眼泪。
    大三低着头，一阵心酸，就再没有话说。以后他俩一道住了几天，老白的女人病了，老白进山里回家去了，也就再没有来。不久日寇打进山西，窑上停工，大三也闹不清世道在怎么翻腾，跟朋友瞎跑了两天，就见日本占了矿山，召窑黑动弹，大三就又下窑去。但以后的营生却比往日还受罪！＠他妈的日本鬼子派在矿上的监工到处乱窜，见谁不顺眼就踢你一皮鞋，骂声：“八格！”打你一巴掌，说句：“三宾格！”那鬼子指点你什么，一大堆鬼话，你听不懂，他又生气，揍你罚你。日本鬼子又随便拿窑黑们耍笑：你躺着刨灰，他搬一块大炭压在你腿上，不让你动，他在一边哈哈大笑；你正动弹，他吹灭你点的油扁，让你黑糊糊地，他哈哈笑着走了。这是把中国人当人看么？窑黑们为了吃饭，没办法，有的就生生忍着，有的也碰对机会给鬼子开个玩笑，对他鞠个躬，笑说道：“＠你妈的！哈哈，大大的！”这么出出气。大三却是忍也忍不住，也没心思拿人家耍笑出气，他浑身冒火！有一回，他正躺着刨炭，一个鬼子忽地站到他腿上，对他笑道：“你的！大大的良民的！”这正给他火上添油！他一翻身，把那鬼子撂了个跟斗，他自己赶紧起来转了几条岔道，慢慢混出窑，走！再换个地势。不过，换到哪里也一样！有时碰对几个朋友，一捣拉，都是说：“这亡国奴营生没法干啦！”个个摇头叹气；大伙拿钱买酒，酒也喝不下；彼此说起过去的老伙计，总是谁谁死了，谁谁没有音讯，年轻的还有被日本抓去当了兵的……人散了，劲冷了！
　　二十四　惹祸
    不久，日本鬼子却忽然到处说那地势是什么“王道乐土”，还到处大喊大叫召工人动弹；有一回，大三正歇了半月多，生活实在没办法，又碰见日本要窑黑去大同，说大同那“乐土”是怎么怎么好，工资是配给米面咸盐洋火布，另外还支给钱，好象很能挣两个，大三就跟上一帮伙计去，去时还有两个伙计指着大三告日本人道：“他的，大大的把式的！”那鬼子就拍着大三肩膀说：“好好干的！皇军欢迎的！”就让大三去当个“小把头”，原来就是领岔。但大三见到那些领事的“大把头”和别的小把头也多没什么把式，专好溜舐日本人，开帐配给工资，大小把头都一层层吃私，窑黑们捞不上两个钱；就是有两个真有点把式的把头，也多是一样样地跟着别的把头胡扯乱干。而且大三自从当了小把头，别的把头们短不了拉他一道去请日本人吃喝搞女人，他不去，有两个把头还几次劝他，叫他这会过日子也随和点，他也不听，人家慢慢就待他冷了，也有人寻他的蹩扭吵闹了！这么一来，日子不多，他又铺盖一卷，开了路。
