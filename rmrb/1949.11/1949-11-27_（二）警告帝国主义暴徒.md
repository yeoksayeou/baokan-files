　　(II) Warning to Imperialist Thugs
    The American imperialist element, an American national named Wald, and his several accomplice thugs, who ganged up to brutally beat our Chinese workers, have been sentenced to imprisonment by the Shenyang Municipal People's Court and deported. This judgment fully complies with the demands of the Chinese people, and we support this correct measure that represents the will of the Chinese people.
    The liberated Chinese people are not to be insulted! In the past six months, imperialist elements in Shanghai, Tianjin, and Beijing have more than once revealed their original faces and claws, but each time they have received the punishment they deserve. This is a necessary step in safeguarding the rights of the people in a land where the people are their own masters. The Wald incident verdict once again warns imperialist elements that whoever dares to lay a hand on the Chinese people will surely suffer. The People's Government protects the legitimate interests of foreign nationals, but will never forgive illegal and criminal acts.

　　（二）警告帝国主义暴徒
    聚众毒殴我国工人的美帝国主义分子美侨瓦尔德和它的几个帮凶打手，已经我沈阳市人民法庭分别判处徒刑，并将其驱逐出境。这一判决完全符合中国人民的要求，我们拥护这一代表中国人民意志的正确措施。
    解放了的中国人民是不可侮的！半年来，帝国主义分子们在上海、天津、北京曾经不止一次地露出了原来的嘴脸和爪牙，但每一次都得到了它们应得的惩罚，这是在人民自己作主人的国土上维护人民权利的必要步骤。瓦尔德事件的判决再一次警告帝国主义分子，谁要敢在中国人民头上动手动脚，他便一定要吃苦头。人民政府保护正当侨民利益，但对于违法犯罪的行为则绝不宽恕。
