　　Non-Military Personnel Prohibited from Wearing Military Uniforms
　　Beijing-Tianjin Garrison Headquarters
　　Explains Military Uniform Styles and Colors

　　[Report from this newspaper] The Beijing-Tianjin Garrison Headquarters, in order to rectify military discipline and appearance, has stipulated that non-People's Liberation Army active duty personnel are not allowed to wear military uniforms. To further clarify and facilitate corrections, the department has provided the following summary explanation:

　　"(1) The military uniforms of the People's Liberation Army (including officers and soldiers) are standardized based on the single military uniforms and cotton military uniforms worn in the summer and winter of this year (1949). The main difference between these and non-military uniforms is the difference in color and style. The military uniform colors are grass green and straw yellow. The style includes a collared top with four flap pockets on the front, no back belt, and Western-style trousers or riding breeches. The summer hat is a round-topped, soft-edged, hard-brimmed cap, and the winter cap is a round-topped, ear-covering, hard-brimmed cotton hat. Those wearing military uniforms must ensure their clothing and hats are neat, with consistent colors for the top and bottom, and must wear military insignia and chest badges.

　　(2) After military personnel are transferred to civilian jobs, their original military uniforms can be worn after being dyed a different color or altered to a different style, but they should not wear military hats.

　　(3) All clothing left over from the U.S. military, whose style and color are different from the People's Liberation Army military uniforms, or whose style is the same but the color is different, or whose color is the same but the style is different, are not restricted when worn by citizens. Kuomintang military uniforms and puppet Japanese military uniforms that have not been dyed or altered are prohibited from being worn by anyone, to avoid confusion with scattered military personnel.

　　(4) If the uniforms worn by non-military organizations, groups, or schools are the same color and style as the People's Liberation Army military uniforms, they should wear the badges of their respective organizations, groups, or schools and should not wear military insignia, to distinguish them from military personnel. However, it is requested that future uniform regulations be different from military uniforms.

　　(5) This regulation is limited to the two municipalities of Beijing and Tianjin. Personnel coming to Beijing and Tianjin from outside areas on official business should also comply with this regulation.

　　(6) Regulations regarding the wearing of overcoats and other outerwear will be issued later."

　　非军人不得穿军服
　　京津卫戍区司令部
　　说明军服式样颜色
    【本报讯】京津卫戍区司令部为了整饬军风纪军容，曾规定非人民解放军现役军人不得穿着军服。该部为更加明确与便利纠察起见，特作如左之概括说明：
    “（一）人民解放军（包括干部战士）之军服，以本（一九四九）年夏冬所着之单军服及棉军服为标准，其与非军服之主要区别为颜色与式样的不同，军服颜色为草绿色及草黄色，其样式，上身有翻领，前身四个兜带盖，后身无背带，下身为西式裤或马裤。夏帽圆顶软边硬帽檐，冬季为圆顶遮耳硬檐棉帽。着军服者必须衣帽整齐，上下身颜色一致，佩戴军徽胸章。
    （二）军人转业后，其原来之军服，经染成别样颜色或改成别种式样后，亦可穿着，但不应戴军帽。
    （三）凡以前美军遗留下之服装，其样式和颜色均与人民解放军军服不相同者，或式样相同而颜色不同，或颜色同而式样不同者，市民穿着时不受限制。国民党军军服及日伪军服未经染色或改样者无论何人均禁止穿着，以免与流散军人混淆。
    （四）各非军事之机关及团体或学校如所着之制服与人民解放军军服颜色式均相同者。应佩戴本机关团体或学校之证章并不得戴军徽，以资与军人有所区别，但要求在今后规定制服时应与军服有所区别。
    （五）此规定只限于京津两市区，凡外区因公来京津之人员，亦应遵此规定行之。
    （六）大衣及外套等服装之着用，暂不规定。”
