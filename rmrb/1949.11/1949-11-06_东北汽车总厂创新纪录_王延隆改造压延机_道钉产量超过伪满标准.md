　　Northeast Auto Works Sets New Record
  　Wang Yanlong改造rolling mill
  　Nail Output Exceeds Manchukuo Standard
    [This Newspaper Despatch] In the new record creation movement at the Northeast Auto Works Nail Manufacturing Plant No. 1, worker Wang Yanlong, in collaboration with technicians,改造 rolling mill, revived the rolling mill department of the South Plant, and improved the efficiency of the rolling mill at the North Plant, setting a new record from a daily output of 1.5 tons of track spikes to 4.5 tons. To overcome the difficulties of not being able to roll three-inch square iron and the frequent breaking of rollers, worker Wang Yanlong drew up his own templates to改造 the roller grooves of the rolling mill, reducing the degree of difference in each rolling and increasing the number of back-and-forth rolling times for each roller. In the past, the first roller went back and forth a total of three times; after his 改造, it can go back and forth six times, allowing the three-inch large square iron to pass smoothly and eliminating the phenomenon of work stoppages due to breakdowns every two or three days, as was common during the Manchukuo era, revitalizing the entire nail manufacturing department and achieving a daily output of three tons of nails. When Wang Yanlong's 改造 of the rolling mill was successful, the North Plant was still stagnating at a level of 1.5 tons per day, one-half short of the Manchukuo-era daily output of three tons. Wang Yanlong also改造 the roller grooves of the North Plant in the same way, increasing the number of back-and-forth passes for each roller, allowing one set of rolling mills to replace the work of two sets, and enabling the rolling mills, which in the past could only produce 4, 5, and 6-point track spike square iron, to now produce 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8-point, as well as 1-inch and 1.2-inch round and square iron of various sizes. This has increased the plant's daily output of track spikes from 1.5 tons in September to the current 4.5 tons, more than doubling September's output and exceeding the Manchukuo-era daily output of three tons by fifty percent (with no increase in coal or number of workers). In addition, worker Wang Yanlong also改造 the feeding machine for the large furnace, making feeding much more convenient; and repaired a well buried in the ash heap that no one knew about, solving the water problem for the rolling mill department.

　　东北汽车总厂创新纪录
  　王延隆改造压延机
  　道钉产量超过伪满标准
    【本报讯】东北汽车总厂制钉一厂在创造新纪录运动中，工友王延隆与技工合作，改造压延机，复活了南厂的压延部，并提高了北厂压延机的效能，由日产道钉一吨半到日产四吨半的新纪录。王延隆工友为了克服不能压三寸方铁和经常折断滚子的困难，他自己画出样板改造了压延机的滚子沟，减少每次压延的差度，增加每一个滚子来去压延的次数，过去第一个滚子来去共三次，经他改造后可以来去压延六次，使三寸大方铁顺利的通过，并消灭过去伪满时代三天两天发生毛病停工的现象，把整个制洋钉部活跃起来，达到日产三吨洋钉。当王延隆改造压延机成功时，北厂还停顿在日产一吨半的水平上，较伪满时日产三吨还差一倍。王延隆又同样改造了北厂滚子沟，增加了每架滚子来去的次数，使一串的压延机代替了两串压延机的工作，并且使过去只能生产四、五、六分道钉方铁的压延机，现在能够生产三、四、五、六、七、八分和一寸、一寸二分各种的圆铁和方铁，使全厂九月份日产道钉一吨半提高到现在日产四吨半，超过九月份的二倍，超过伪满时日产三吨的百分之五十（用煤和工人数都未增加）。此外王延隆工友还改造大炉的送料机，使送料大为方便；修理埋在灰堆中向来没有人知道的洋井，解决了压延部用水的问题。
