　　Shanghai Strictly Prohibits Profiteering in Grain Prices
　　Boss of Qingfeng Rice Shop Punished by People's Court
　　Grain Company Increases Supply and Expands Retail Sales
　　[Special Dispatch from Our Shanghai Correspondent, 17th] Recently in Shanghai, a small number of speculative rice merchants have taken the opportunity to inflate grain prices in the market, fueling the rise and deliberately creating chaos, affecting the lives of citizens in an attempt to reap exorbitant profits. On the 16th, when the Shanghai Grain Company supplied the rice market with large quantities at 75,000 to 80,000 yuan per shi, some rice shops raised their retail prices to as high as 160,000 yuan per shi, a difference of almost double the wholesale market price. In order to take effective steps to eliminate this phenomenon, stabilize the lives of citizens, and ensure sufficient supply of rice and facilitate citizens' purchases, the Shanghai Grain Company has decided to select more than 100 rice shops in various districts of the city as special retail rice shops to directly sell rice as agents. It also set reasonable retail prices to reduce the burden on citizens and stabilize their lives. Furthermore, in order to strictly prohibit the speculative activities of unscrupulous merchants who raise grain prices and disrupt the market, the Public Security Bureau, upon the request of the masses on the 16th, took the bosses of seven rice shops, including Qingfeng, Yuantai, Tianshengfu, Luxin, Tongde, Xiekang, and Zhenxing, into custody for interrogation for profiteering by raising grain prices. Except for Guo Qiuquan, the boss of Qingfeng Rice Shop, who was handed over to the People's Court for punishment due to the seriousness of the circumstances, the other six were released after being educated and repenting for their minor offenses. This measure has been warmly supported by the citizens.

　　上海严禁哄抬粮价
  　庆丰米店老板被解法院惩处
    粮食公司大量供应扩大零售
    【本报记者上海十七日专电】上海近日少数投机米商在粮食市场乘机哄抬粮价，推波助澜，蓄意捣乱，影响市民生活，借以图谋暴利。十六日，上海市粮食公司于米市场以每石七万五千至八万元大量供应时，若干米店竟抬高门市售价每石达十六万元，与市场批发价相差一倍之巨。上海市粮食公司为采取有效步骤消灭此种现象，以安定市民生活，保证充分供应食米及便利市民购买起见，特决定在全市各区选择米店百余家为特约零售米店，代理直接销售。并订定合理的门售价格，借此减低市民负担，安定生活。又，公安局为严禁哄抬粮价扰乱市场的奸商投机活动，于十六日接受群众要求，将庆丰、源泰、天盛福、陆新、同德、协康、振兴等七家哄抬粮价牟取暴利的米店老板带局讯问。除庆丰米店老板郭秋泉因情节较重解法院惩处外，其余六家因情节较轻经教育悔过后即开释。此项措施获得市民热烈拥护。
