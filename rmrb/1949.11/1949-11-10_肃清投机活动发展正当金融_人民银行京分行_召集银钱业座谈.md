　　Eliminating Speculative Activities, Developing Legitimate Finance
  　People's Bank of China Beijing Branch
  　Convenes Symposium of Banks and Money Shops
    [Beijing News] The private money shops of Juyi, Yuansheng, Fucheng, and Datetong in this city have repeatedly engaged in illegal business activities, and the People's Government will impose sanctions according to law. In order to educate the general banks and money shops in this city to thoroughly abide by government laws and regulations and develop legitimate financial business, the Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China, using Juyi and the other three as examples, recently convened a symposium of both the banking and money shop industries. Attendees included Jia Xingwu and Yin Yu＠, the manager and deputy manager of the Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China, and more than 60 managers from various private banks and money shops. First, Qi Zhigang, the section chief of the Financial Management Section of the Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China, reported on the illegal facts of Juyi and other four money shops since liberation, including reselling gold and silver dollars, issuing bad checks, absorbing public funds, undertaking gold mortgage loans, and misappropriating inventory for lending and collecting secret interest, thereby disrupting financial order. Then, more than ten responsible persons from private banks and money shops, such as Han Zhenhua, the manager of the Yanyeh Bank, spoke, unanimously believing that such illegal behavior is a stain on the banking and money shop industry in the capital, and the government should strictly punish it. Each bank and money shop should strengthen the study of government policies and laws and regulations, and no behavior that harms the interests of the people should be allowed again. Liang Zhengfu, the general manager of Qianxing Money Shop, who recently violated the law, made a self-criticism on the spot, frankly admitting his illegal behavior. This kind of mistake is the ideological poison left over from the old society for thousands of years. Business operations only start from personal interests. Today, we must launch an ideological struggle against ourselves, correct speculative psychology, and do legitimate financial business that is beneficial to the development of production. Finally, Jia Xingwu and Yin Yu＠, the manager and deputy manager of the Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China, spoke, pointing out that the development of the banking and money shop industry must move in the direction of benefiting the national economy and the people's livelihood and serving production; otherwise, it will inevitably lead to personal ruin and have no future. Referring to the provisions of Article 39 of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, they clarified that financial undertakings should be strictly managed by the state, and private financial undertakings operating legally should be subject to the supervision and guidance of the state. Those who engage in financial speculation and undermine the national financial undertakings should be severely punished. It is hoped that each money shop will learn from the Common Program, improve its business, eliminate various speculative activities, reform its management methods, supervise each other, and no longer harm the people, contributing its strength to the high tide of economic construction. Manager Jia Xingwu stated that the government can consider leniently dealing with those who have violated the law but can truly repent and rehabilitate; if they still persist in their mistakes and refuse to mend their ways, the People's Government will never tolerate them.
