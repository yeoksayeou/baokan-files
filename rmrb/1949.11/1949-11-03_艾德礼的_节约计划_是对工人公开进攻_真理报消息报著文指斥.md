Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 2nd - TASS Moscow Dispatch: A Pravda observer recently wrote an article commenting on the so-called emergency "austerity program" recently proposed by British Prime Minister Attlee, stating: The Labour government's economic policy since coming to power signifies an open attack by British monopoly capital on the living standards of the working class. However, the new plan significantly strengthens and expands the scope of this offensive. What does this "emergency plan" hold in store for the British people? First, as can be seen from Chancellor of the Exchequer Cripps's statement, further increases in the value of basic necessities are imminent. At the same time, the Labour leaders want to continue the so-called wage freeze policy with even greater determination. Under conditions of constantly rising prices, this is clearly a policy of systematically reducing real wages. The "emergency plan" stipulates further reductions in food imports. Therefore, workers who are already suffering from malnutrition will have to tighten their belts even further. Within the plan, the amount of money allocated to housing construction has been drastically reduced, and the previously meager funds for education, health, etc., have already been cut. Has the Labour government restrained its military desires? No. Military spending is actually swelling. In order to deceive public opinion, the Labour government has adopted despicable tricks. It announced its intention to "cut" military spending... by 30 million pounds. At the same time, under the guise of this purely "symbolic" saving, it is using the emergency plan to extend the term of military service from eighteen months to two years.

The observer pointed out that the Labour government's adoption of an "emergency plan" aimed at depriving the working class of basic interests is fraught with serious political consequences. We should remember that even before the devaluation, more than half of all trade union members had raised demands for wage increases. And now, regardless of all the tactics of the ruling group, demands are increasing, and their demands have become more persistent and more resolute. Attlee's "emergency plan" will not cure the serious ailments of the British economy. But, undoubtedly, it will exacerbate domestic political difficulties.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 2nd - TASS Moscow Dispatch: Izvestia recently published an article entitled "British 'Merchants' and 'Common People,'" commenting on the British Labour government's austerity plan, stating: Attlee announced the so-called government spending cuts plan on October 24th. It is an open secret that this plan originated in the United States: during the recent US-British Washington financial talks (which were immediately followed by the devaluation of the pound), American newspapers listed a number of demands, which were precisely the measures announced by Attlee.

According to Attlee's plan, investment will be reduced by 140 million pounds, and education funding will be reduced by 5 million pounds. "Savings" will be achieved by reducing government food subsidies, eliminating cheap breakfasts for schoolchildren, and implementing charges for medical treatment, etc.

The realization of this austerity plan, like the recent devaluation of the pound which raised the cost of living by 10 percent, will place the full impact on the shoulders of millions of working people in Britain. The reduction in government subsidies will force prices to rise sharply further. The reduction in investment will lead to an increase in unemployment. According to the Daily Express, 125,000 construction workers will lose their jobs. In addition, 40,000 people will lose their jobs due to the reduction in the import of dollar goods. The reduction in housing construction funding means that 20,000 fewer houses will be built. At the same time, the excess profits of the capitalists remain untouched. Not only that, British monopoly capital can expect to earn even higher profits due to the extension of the working day and more intensive labor. Therefore, it is not surprising that the "merchants" - that is, the big capitalists of Britain - fully agree with the actions of the Attlee and Bevin government. Some sections of the British bourgeoisie are prepared to support the Labour Party in the 1950 general election.

However, to the dismay of senior Labour figures and their leaders: the British "common people" are increasingly seeing the true face of the infamous "democratic socialism" and they oppose the Labour government's policy of attempting to lower the living standards of the working people. This is evidenced by the resolution of the British Peace Congress, which calls not for lowering living standards and further economic and political dependence on the United States, but for raising living standards and expanding mutual trade with non-dollar areas, especially with the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries.

### 艾德礼的“节约计划”是对工人公开进攻　真理报消息报著文指斥

　　艾德礼的“节约计划”是对工人公开进攻
  　真理报消息报著文指斥
    【新华社北京二日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报观察家顷著文评论英首相艾德礼最近提出的所谓紧急“节约计划”称：工党政府上台以来的经济政策，意味着英国垄断资本对工人阶级生活水准的公开进攻。但是，新的计划又相当大地加强并扩展了这种攻势的范围。这个“紧急计划”为英国人民准备了些什么呢？首先是，如象从财政大臣克利浦斯的声明中可以看出的，基本必需品价值的进一步上涨已在眼前，同时，工党的领袖想以更大的决心来继续所谓工资冻结政策。在物价不断上涨的情况下，这很明显地就是有系统地削减实际工资的政策。“紧急计划”规定更进一步地削减食粮进口，因此，已受营养不足之苦的工人们，将要更加束紧他们的腰带。在计划之内，剧烈地削减了房屋建筑的款额，而以前就极为微少的教育、卫生等等经费，早已就被削减了。是否工党政府已经抑止了它的军事欲望呢？不是的。军事费用实际上正在膨胀着。为了要朦蔽舆论，工党政府采用了卑劣的诡计。它曾宣布打算“削减”军事开支……三千万镑。同时，在这个纯粹“象征性的”节约的掩蔽之下，它借紧急计划之助而将服兵役的期限自十八个月延长至两年。
    观察家指出，工党政府之采取旨在剥夺工人阶级基本利益的“紧急计划”充满了严重的政治后果。我们应该记得，甚至在贬值之前，全体工会会员就有一半以上提出了增加工资的要求。而现在，不管统治集团的一切策略，要求却正在越来越多，而且，他们的要求已变得更为坚持、更为坚决了。艾德礼的“紧急计划”将不能救治英国经济的严重病症。但是，无疑地，它将会加剧国内的政治困难。
    【新华社北京二日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：消息报顷以“英国的‘商人’与‘老百姓’”为题，评论英国工党政府的削减计划称：艾德礼在十月二十四日宣布了所谓政府削减开支的计划。这一计划之渊源于美国，乃是公开的秘密：在不久以前举行的美英华盛顿金融会谈（紧跟着这次会谈就带来了英镑贬值）时，美国报纸曾列举了一些要求，这些要求就正是艾德礼宣布的那些措施。
    根据艾德礼的计划，投资将削减一亿四千万镑，教育经费将削减五百万镑。“节约”将以减低政府的食粮补贴，取消供给学童的廉价早餐以及实施诊疗收费等等办法来实现。
    这一削减计划之实现，其冲击力将全部加在英国千百万劳动人民的肩上，就象不久前的英镑贬值使生活费用上涨百分之十那样。政府补贴的减少，将迫使物价进一步地急剧上涨。投资的削减将招致失业的增加。据每日快报估计，将有十二万五千建筑业工人失掉工作。此外，由于减少美元货物的入口，将有四万人丧失职业。房屋建筑经费的削减，则表示要建筑的房屋要减少两万幢。而在同时，资本家的超额利润却原封未动。不仅如此，由于工作日的延长和更加紧张的劳动，英国的垄断资本还可望获得更高的利润。因此，“商人”——也就是英国的大资本家之完全同意艾德礼、贝文政府的行动，也就无足为怪了。英国资产阶级的某些部分，已准备在一九五○年的大选中支持工党分子。
    但是，使工党高级人物和他们的头子们沮丧的是：英国“老百姓”已越来越看清了臭名远扬的“民主社会主义”的真面目，他们反对工党政府企图降低劳动人民生活水平的政策。这可以由英国和平大会的决议得到证明，该决议不是要求降低生活水平和更进一步在经济上和政治上倚赖美国，而是要求提高生活标准和扩大与非美元区尤其是与苏联和人民民主国家间的相互贸易。
