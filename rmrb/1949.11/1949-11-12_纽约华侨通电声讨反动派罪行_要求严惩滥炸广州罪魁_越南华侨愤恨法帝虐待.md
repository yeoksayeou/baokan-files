Xinhua News Agency, Prague, November 11th: New York Dispatch: The New York Overseas Chinese Laundry Association, in response to the Kuomintang reactionary remnants' indiscriminate bombing of Guangzhou on October 18th, which resulted in the killing of overseas Chinese dependents and compatriots in their hometowns, convened a standing committee meeting on October 23rd. It was resolved to send a telegram to the entire country denouncing the crimes of the Kuomintang reactionary faction and demanding that the central People's Government of the motherland severely punish the masterminds behind the indiscriminate bombing. The telegram stated: "Reports indicate that Chiang's planes indiscriminately bombed the urban area of Guangzhou twice on October 18th. On October 22nd, a Central News Agency Taiwan dispatch also stated that the Kuomintang reactionary authorities had decided to regularly bomb Guangzhou in order to achieve so-called joint naval and air blockade of Guangzhou. The Kuomintang's Four Big Families reactionary authorities have committed countless crimes in their twelve years of treasonous dictatorship, corruption, and embezzlement. Now, on the eve of their complete demise, they are still carrying out vicious indiscriminate bombings against innocent civilians, which is truly outrageous. The United States' supply of airplanes, bombs, and gasoline to the Kuomintang reactionary remnant government to indiscriminately bomb civilians is also intolerable by world justice. The majority of our overseas Chinese in the United States are from Guangdong, and we cannot bear to see our fellow villagers and our own families suffer the same tragic fate as those in Kaifeng, Shanghai, and other places who were victims of Chiang's planes' indiscriminate bombing. Therefore, we hereby declare: we are determined to rise up together with our elders, brothers, sisters, and compatriots across the country to condemn the Kuomintang reactionary authorities, who are acting like beasts, and we hope that the central People's Government of the motherland will severely investigate those who launched the indiscriminate bombings, so as to uphold the national law and appease the people's anger."

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 11th: According to a Vietnam News Agency report on the 9th: Vietnamese Overseas Chinese are expressing extreme anger regarding the various restrictions imposed on them by the French. According to an overseas Chinese businessman from Haiphong: The French regulations for overseas Chinese took effect on July 1st. The regulations order every overseas Chinese who travels ten kilometers, or more than ten kilometers, or over fifty kilometers outside the city to pay two, five or ten yuan (Vietnamese currency) in travel tax. The overseas Chinese businessman complained that the French occupation zone always delays the issuance of visas to overseas Chinese. He said that overseas Chinese refer to the travel tax collected by the French as "ransom money." It is reported that not long ago, French naval forces attacked a certain place on the central Vietnamese coast between Saigon and Hue, burned down more than forty Chinese houses, severely beat Chinese youths, and raped seventy-two Chinese women. The head of the overseas Chinese district was also brutally treated by the French. During the French military attack, the losses suffered by the overseas Chinese amounted to about 25 million Vietnamese currency.

    【新华社布拉格十一日电】纽约讯：纽约华侨洗衣馆联合会，以国民党反动余孽，于十月十八日两次滥炸广州，残杀侨胞眷属及家乡同胞，特于十月二十三日召集常委会，议决通电全国，声讨国民党反动派的罪行，并要求祖国的中央人民政府严惩主使滥炸的罪魁。电文称：“报载蒋机于十月十八日两次滥炸广州市区，二十二日国民党中央社台湾消息又谓国民党反动当局决定经常轰炸广州，以收所谓海空联合封锁广州之效。国民党四大家族的反动当局，十二年来卖国独裁、贪污腐化，已罪恶盈贯，今于行将全部死亡的前夕，仍对无辜平民施行毒辣的滥炸，实令人发指。而美国之供给国民党反动残府以飞机炸弹及汽油滥炸平民，亦为世界正义所不容。我旅美侨胞多为粤人，不忍见家乡同胞及自己的眷属继开封、上海各地的同胞之后，惨遇蒋机滥炸。用特宣言：誓与全国父老兄弟姊妹共起声讨行同禽兽的国民党反动当局，并希望祖国中央人民政府对于发动滥炸的罪魁，严厉追究，以彰国纪，而平民愤。”
    【新华社北京十一日电】据越南通讯社九日报道：越南华侨对于法方对华侨的种种限制表示十分愤怒。据来自海防的一华侨商人谈称：法方颁布的对华侨的规定，已于七月一日起实行。该规定命令每一华侨如出城十公里、或十公里以上、或超过五十公里之旅行者，须缴二元、五元或十元（越币）的通行税。该华侨商人抱怨法国占领区给华侨签发签证总是拖延。他说，华侨将法方征收的通行税称为“赎身钱”。据悉，不久以前，法海运部队进功西贡、顺化中间越南中部海岸上某地时，曾烧毁了四十余间中国人的房屋，毒打了中国青年，并奸污了七十二名中国妇女。华侨区的区长也遭到法人的残酷对待。在法军进袭期间，华侨遭到的损失约达两千五百万元越币。
