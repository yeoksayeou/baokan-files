On the Fundamental Differences Between Simple Commodity Production and Capitalist Commodity Production
    Wang Xuewen
    In the first issue of "Study" compiled and printed by the General Learning Committee of directly affiliated organizations in Hebei, there is an article titled "The Fundamental Differences Between Simple Commodity Production and Capitalist Commodity Production." This is an opinion on the answer to a question in the People's Daily learning mailbox on August 18th. According to the author, Comrade Liu Honghe, the aspect of the fundamental differences between the two types of commodity production "is not sufficient and clear, and needs to be supplemented." I have some opinions on Comrade Liu Honghe's "supplementary" opinions, written below:

    I.
    The People's Daily's answer to the fundamental differences between the two types of commodity production only simply presents three points from the aspects of economic development period, mode of production, and purpose of production. Because it is simple, the explanation is insufficient, and each point can be supplemented. If Comrade Liu paid attention, he could also add: the future of production development. The question is only on what principles to supplement and how to supplement.

    II.
    Comrade Liu believes that the first point that is "too unclear" and needs to be supplemented is "the relationship to the means of production (ownership relationship)," "because this is the main link in distinguishing classes and analyzing social systems." Comrade Liu believes that "the relationship to the means of production (ownership relationship)" can be "extended" from the point of mode of production. But in my opinion, "the relationship to the means of production (ownership relationship)" is not "extended" from the mode of production, but is included in the mode of production. The mode of production in history is the unity of a certain production relationship and a certain productive force. Production relations include:
    1. The position in the historical social production system.
    2. The relationship to the means of production.
    3. The role in the social labor organization.
    4. The share and method of obtaining social wealth.
    Comrade Liu only supplemented the second point, without mentioning the others. This kind of supplement is not sufficient.
    Secondly, Comrade Liu believes that "the relationship to the means of production (ownership relationship)" is "the main link in distinguishing classes and analyzing social systems," which is correct, and I agree. However, Comrade Liu regards this point as a "fundamental difference" point, which I think is not fully considered. Because the ownership relationship, economically speaking, is the distribution relationship, and legally speaking, it is the ownership relationship (or property relationship). No matter how important the distribution relationship or the ownership relationship is, distribution is always determined by production. I believe that production should be fundamental, not distribution.

    III.
    Comrade Liu also cited three characteristics from the "Introduction to Social Science" regarding the explanation of simple commodity economy: (1) the means of production belong to the producer himself. (2) commodity production is for exchange, for sale. (3) based on one's own labor, without hired labor. He believes that "the characteristics of simple commodity production are as indicated above," and the author of the People's Daily article "neglected the explanation of the above items 1 and 3."
    I think Comrade Liu's opinion is also not sufficiently considered. Points 1 and 3 mentioned in the "Introduction to Social Science" are already included in the mode of production, and are equivalent to points 2 and 3 in the four points of production relations mentioned above. These two points of "supplement" can only be regarded as a partial explanation of the "mode of production," and cannot be regarded as a "sufficient" "supplement." Comrade Liu believes that "the characteristics of simple commodity production are as indicated above," which I think is not enough.
    Secondly, what the "Introduction to Social Science" says are three characteristics of the simple commodity economy. Comrade Liu believes that they are also the characteristics of simple commodity production. I don't know what Comrade Liu based this on? Is simple commodity economy the same as simple commodity production? Or is there another saying?
    In my opinion, the three characteristics of the simple commodity economy mentioned in the "Introduction to Social Science" can not only be supplemented and revised, but the order can also be changed as follows:
    1 Production is based on one's own labor.
    2 The means of production belong to the producer himself.
    3 Production technology is handicraft.
    4 The purpose of production is for exchange, for sale.

    IV.
    Finally, Comrade Liu also said this: "In addition, in order to make the problem better understood, it is also necessary to attach an explanation of the fields of activity of simple commodity production and capitalist commodity production, such as the raw materials and sales market of simple commodities, which are usually limited to the local area, while capitalist commodity production is the opposite." I agree with Comrade Liu's opinion that, in order to make the problem better understood, we can put forward the two points of raw materials and market for comparison. However, it should be pointed out that Comrade Liu's wording has a grammatical error. The market is the field of commodity circulation, not the field of commodity production; it is not appropriate to say "raw materials of simple commodities," it is only appropriate to say "raw materials for simple commodity production." If we talk about the source of raw materials, it can include the production area and the market; if it is raw material processing, it only belongs to the scope of production.
    In addition, in order to make the problem better understood, not only the two points of raw materials and market can be mentioned, but also: the scale of production, the dispersion and concentration of means of production and labor, the level of production technology, the amount of funds, the relationship with commerce and usury, the income and expenditure situation, reproduction, and many other issues. However, as the fundamental difference between the two types of commodity production, these are not needed, so they are all omitted. If raw materials and markets have "the necessity of attaching an explanation," aren't the others necessary? Can't many other points also distinguish between the two types of commodity production? I believe that the important and fundamental thing is to grasp the basic differences; other non-basic differences, although necessary, have to be placed in a secondary position.
    My reply to Comrade Liu's supplementary opinions is as such. I wonder what Comrade Liu thinks? What does the General Learning Committee of directly affiliated organizations in Hebei think?

    Appendix "The Fundamental Differences Between Simple Commodity Production and Capitalist Commodity Production"
    On August 18th of this year, someone raised two questions about commodity production in the People's Daily learning mailbox, one of which was "What are the fundamental differences between simple commodity production and capitalist commodity production? What is the significance of distinguishing them?" (The word "simple" is translated as "simple" in political economy, and the meaning is the same). I completely agree with the second half of the editor's answer to this question, but the first half, that is, the aspect of "fundamental differences," I feel is not sufficiently clear. It is necessary to add supplementary explanations.
    The editor's answer to the fundamental differences between simple commodity production and capitalist commodity production is:
    1. So-called simple commodity production is commodity production before capitalism; capitalist commodity production is commodity production in the capitalist period (from the perspective of economic development period).
    2. Simple commodity production is the commodity production of small producers (farmers, handicraftsmen); capitalist commodity production is commodity production under the control of capitalists (from the perspective of the mode of production).
    3. Simple commodity production is production for exchange and for sale; capitalist commodity production is production for making money (for profit, which profit comes from exploiting hired workers) (from the perspective of the purpose of production). The above answers are not clear enough. I think it is more appropriate to distinguish and explain the relationship (ownership relationship) of the producers of the two types of commodity production to the means of production. Because this is the main link in distinguishing classes and analyzing social systems. Of course, the editor can extend to this aspect in the second item of the answer, but without saying it, it is not easy to make people associate it with "Before capitalism appeared, that is, in the Middle Ages, small production existed everywhere, and this small production was based on the private ownership of the means of production by the producers." (Engels said)
    According to the "Introduction to Social Science" (compiled by the Yan'an Social Science Research Association) regarding the economic explanation of simple commodities, it is pointed out that it has the following three characteristics:
    1. The means of production belong to the producer himself.
    2. Commodity production is for exchange, for sale.
    3. Based on one's own labor, without hired labor.
    I think the characteristics of simple commodity production are as indicated above. The editor neglected the explanation of the above items 1 and 3 when distinguishing it from capitalist commodity production.
    In addition, in order to make the problem better understood, it is also necessary to attach an explanation of the fields of activity of simple commodity production and capitalist commodity production, such as the raw materials and sales market of simple commodity production, which are usually limited to the local area, while capitalist commodity production is the opposite.

### 关于“简单商品生产与资本主义商品生产的基本区别”

专栏：

　　关于“简单商品生产与资本主义商品生产的基本区别”
    王学文
    在河北直属机关总学委会编印的“学习”第一号上，有“简单商品生产与资本主义商品生产的基本区别”一文，这是对于八月十八日人民日报学习信箱上问题解答的一种意见。据作者刘洪河同志说，关于两种商品生产基本区别方面“尚不充分与明确，有加以补充的必要”。我对于刘洪河同志的“补充”意见，还有些意见，写在下面：
　　一
    人民日报上所答的两种商品生产的基本区别，只从经济发展的时期、生产方式、生产的目的方面简单地提出三点。因为简单，说明就不够，每一点都可加以补充。如果刘同志注意到的话，三点之外，还可以加：生产发展前途一点。问题只在根据什么原则补充和如何补充法。
　　二
    刘同志认为“太不明确”需要补充的第一点，是“对于生产手段的关系（占有关系）”，“因为这是区分阶级，分析社会制度的主要一环”。刘同志认为“对于生产手段的关系（占有关系）”，由生产方式一点“可以引伸”出来。但据我看来，“对于生产手段的关系（占有关系）”，并不是由生产方式方面“可以引伸”出来，而是包含在生产方式之内。历史上的生产方式，是一定的生产关系和一定生产力的统一。生产关系包括着：
    １、在历史上社会生产系统中的地位。
    ２、对于生产手段的关系。
    ３、在社会劳动组织中的作用。
    ４、对于社会财富所取得的份额与取得方法。
    刘同志只补充了第二点，不提其他，这种补充是不充分的。
    其次，刘同志认为“对于生产手段的关系（占有关系）”是“区分阶级，分析社会制度的主要一环”，这是对的，我也同意。不过刘同志把这一点当作“基本区别”点，我认为考虑的不够充分。因为占有关系，在经济上说是分配关系，在法律上说是所有关系（或财产关系），不管分配关系或所有关系怎样重要，分配总是要由生产来决定的。我认为应以生产为基本，不应以分配为基本。
　　三
    刘同志又根据“社会科学概论”对于简单商品经济的解释，举出三个特点：（１）生产工具属于生产者自己。（２）商品生产是为了交换，为了出卖。（３）以自己的劳动为基础，没有雇佣劳动。他认为“简单商品生产的特点，亦即如上所指”，人民日报该文作者“忽略了以上１、３两项的说明”。
    我认为刘同志这种意见，也是考虑不够的。“社会科学概论”所说１３两点，已包括在生产方式之内，和上面所说生产关系的四点中２３两点相当。这两点“补充”，只可当作“生产方式”的部分的说明，不能当作“充分”的“补充”。刘同志认为“简单商品生产的特点，亦即如上所指”，我认为是不够的。
    其次，“社会科学概论”所说，是简单商品经济的三个特点。刘同志认为亦即简单商品生产的特点，我不知刘同志是根据什么说的？是否简单商品经济就是简单商品生产呢？还是有其他说法？
    “社会科学概论”所说简单商品经济的三个特点，在我看来，不但还可以补充修改，其次序也可改变如下：
    １生产建立在自己劳动的基础上。
    ２生产手段属于生产者自己所有。
    ８生产技术是手工业的。
    ４生产目的是为交换，为出卖。
　　四
    最后，刘同志还这样说：“此外，为了使问题更好明白，把简单商品生产与资本主义商品生产的活动领域，附带加以说明也是必要的，如简单商品的原料与销售市场，通常是局限在本地区，而资本主义商品生产则反是”。我同意刘同志的意见，为了使问题更好明白，可以提出原料与市场两点来比较。不过，要指出刘同志的用语，是有语病的。市场是商品流通的领域，不是商品生产的领域；不宜说“简单商品的原料”，只宜说“简单商品生产的原料”。如果说原料来源，可以包括生产地区与市场，如果是原料加工，才只是属于生产的范围。
    此外，为了使问题更好明白，不仅举原料与市场两点，还可以举：生产规模，生产手段与劳动力的分散与集中，生产技术的高低，资金的多少，与商业、贷利业的关系，收支情况，再生产等等许多问题，不过当作两种商品生产的基本区别，就不需要这些，所以都略而不提了。如果原料与市场有“附带加以说明的必要”，其他难道不必要了吗？其他许多点不是也可以区别两种商品生产吗？我认为重要的基本的在于把握其基本区别点，其他非基本区别的，虽有必要，也只好放在次要的地位了。
    我对刘同志补充意见的答复如此，不知刘同志以为何如？河北直属机关总学委会以为如何？

　　附录　“简单商品生产与资本主义商品生产的基本区别”
    本年八月十八日人民日报学习信箱上有人提出了两个关于商品生产的问题，其中之一是“单纯的商品生产与资本主义的商品生产的基本区别是什么？区别它有何意义？”（“单纯”两字在政治经济学上译为“简单”意思是一样的），编者对此问题的解答后半我完全同意，但前半，也就是“基本区别”方面，我觉得尚不充分明确。有加以补充的必要。
    编者对于简单的商品生产与资本主义商品生产的基本区别的解答是：
    １、所谓单纯商品生产是资本主义以前的商品生产；资本主义的商品生产是资本主义时期的商品生产（从经济发展的时期说）。
    ２、单纯商品生产，是小生产者（农民、手工业者）的商品生产，资本主义的商品生产是资本家支配下的商品生产（从生产方式说）。
    ３、单纯商品生产是为交换为出卖而生产，资本主义的商品生产是为赚钱（为利润、其利润由剥削被雇佣的工人而来）而生产（从生产的目的说）。以上解答不太明确。我认为应将两种商品生产底生产者，对于生产手段的关系（占有关系）再加以区别说明，较为妥当。因为这是区分阶级，分析社会制度的主要一环。当然，编者在解答的第二项上，是可以引伸到这方面来的，但不说出，不易使人连带意会到“在资本主义未出现以前，就是中世纪时代，到处都存在小生产，这种小生产，是以生产手段为生产者私人所有为基础的。”（恩格斯说）
    再据社会科学概论（延安社会科学研究会编）对于简单商品的经济解释，指出有下列三个特点：
    １、生产工具属于生产者自己。　
    ２、商品生产是为了交换，为了出卖。
    ３、以自己的劳动为基础，没有雇佣劳动。
    我觉得简单商品生产的特点，亦即如上所指。编者在与资本主义商品生产相区别时，忽略了以上１、３两项的说明。
    此外，为了使问题更好明白，把简单商品生产与资本主义商品生产的活动领域，附带加以说明也是必要的，如简单商品生产的原料与销售市场，通常是局限在本地区，而资本主义商品生产则反是。
