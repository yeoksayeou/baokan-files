How to Motivate Learning Among Government Cadres
    ——Experience of the North China Highway Bureau Leaders in Learning Competitions
    First, Set Goals

The North China Highway Bureau's study of the documents of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the mobilization of learning competitions, and the election of learning models have now concluded. In this learning movement, comrades in general have made significant progress. Previously, many people were late for study every morning, but after this learning movement, the number of latecomers has been greatly reduced. Units such as the General Affairs Section, Materials Section, Management Section, and Accounting Section spontaneously organized study sessions, divided into several mutual aid groups, dispersing comrades with lower cultural and theoretical levels into each group so that they could receive more assistance and make a new month-long study plan. After a month, learning models will be re-elected through democratic appraisal. Now many comrades are buying books and subscribing to magazines; more people are going to the library to find reference materials. Comrades are also more closely united. Previously, everyone felt that the life review meetings every Saturday afternoon lacked content, and the opinions raised were always the same old stuff. After this study, everyone has taken a step forward in their thinking, and the methods are much more flexible. Last Saturday afternoon, comrades from the Documentation Section, General Affairs Section, Administration Section, Personnel Office, and other units spontaneously organized a trip to the outside, moving the life review meeting to Beihai and the Temple of Heaven, and solving many ideological problems in a lively atmosphere. In addition, everyone's labor viewpoint has also been strengthened. The road in front of the Highway Bureau was very bad and inconvenient to walk on. The staff union mobilized all comrades to repair it in their spare time. The project, estimated to take six days, was completed in three days. These facts prove that comrades have gained a lot through this learning movement. The leadership has also gained some experience in how to carry out cadre learning, which can be summarized as follows:

    　　　　(1) Grasp the Characteristics of Institutional Learning
    The task of the school is to guide students to learn; in the institution, the main task is work, and the purpose of our learning is to improve the working ability of cadres and ensure the completion of administrative tasks. Therefore, the learning of institutions must be coordinated with administrative tasks, and in terms of time, it must never conflict with working hours. Carrying out theoretical and ideological education for staff cadres under such a principle can achieve certain results. Previously, the comrades who led the learning here ignored this point. They did not take into account all administrative tasks and conditions, and came up with their own set of learning plans. During office hours, they often convened group leaders' meetings and study committee meetings, which delayed the administrative tasks assigned to these group leaders and committee members. As a result, the administrative leaders of each unit had opinions about them. These comrades were busy all day, but instead received criticism, so they felt that promoting learning was a mental burden. Gradually, they were unwilling to participate in group leaders' meetings or study committee meetings, which created a phenomenon of poor communication between superiors and subordinates. If the people who lead the learning cannot grasp the learning group leaders, it is impossible to promote learning well. Therefore, leading learning in institutions must be coordinated with administrative tasks, and never come up with a separate set of plans. Group leaders' meetings should not be convened at any time. There must be sufficient preparation before the meeting, and the problem should be solved quickly in a very short time. It is best not to take up office hours for the meeting, so that learning does not hinder work and ensures the smooth promotion of learning.

    　　　　(2) Consistent from Top to Bottom, In-Depth Mobilization
    Administrative leaders of institutions often neglect to grasp the leadership of learning because they are busy with administrative work. This is also one of the main reasons why it is not easy to do a good job in institutional learning. This time, we launched a learning competition, which was consistent from top to bottom and deeply mobilized. First, the director convened a bureau affairs meeting to specifically discuss learning issues and decided to be responsible at all levels: if a unit does not learn well, the administrative cadre of that unit will be responsible for making a review; if a party member does not learn well and cannot play a leading role, they will be specially criticized and educated within the party. In this way, the previous bias of administrative leaders neglecting learning was corrected, and everyone went to the masses for in-depth mobilization, helping comrades to find reference materials, so the comrades' learning enthusiasm was even higher. This time, the Management Section was able to obtain the collective learning model, and the good leadership of the section chief was a major reason. He was the first to take the lead, arriving earliest in the morning, and talking and playing with comrades after get off work, so the comrades in the Management Section were very united, and both learning and work were done very well.

    　　　　(3) Launch Competitions to Increase Enthusiasm
    Electing learning models is a way to promote learning. Therefore, after everyone's enthusiasm has been initially improved, the slogan of electing learning models can be put forward, which can further improve everyone's enthusiasm. The best way to elect is to mobilize everyone to make a democratic appraisal, and to list helping others and work performance as appraisal conditions, to prevent the bias of only caring about oneself, ignoring others, and being detached from the masses in learning, and at the same time elect unit models.

    　　　　(4) Implement a System of Commendation and Criticism
    After everyone's enthusiasm has been improved, it is necessary to grasp the leadership well and not let it go its own way. Units that are usually lax in learning should be given appropriate praise and encouragement as long as they have made slight improvements; units that usually learn better should be cultivated as models and called on everyone to learn from them. In our movement this time, because the General Affairs Section was usually more lax, we praised their improvements on the blackboard newspaper, and their enthusiasm was even higher. They made learning plans, bought magazines, looked for reference materials, and put forward challenges and guarantees to everyone. The Materials Section was busy with work, their learning enthusiasm was low, and many people were late. We put forward appropriate criticisms, and they held their own meetings to review and their enthusiasm also improved; later, they organized mutual aid groups and created a new method of group collective learning. The Management Section had a very good learning enthusiasm, so we cultivated and encouraged them, and called on other units to learn from them, which drove the learning enthusiasm of the whole.

    　　　　(5) Hold a Well-Prepared Award Ceremony
    The purpose of electing models is to improve everyone's learning enthusiasm in order to promote learning, but there is often a bias of learning for the sake of electing models. Therefore, at the award ceremony, we should prepare well in advance, appropriately commend some good typical examples, criticize some incorrect ideas and biases, and make a comprehensive summary report. It is best to cultivate some good typical examples and let them report their learning methods and experience themselves. At the same time, we should also find some typical examples of poor learning and let them make their own reviews, which can encourage everyone's learning enthusiasm and criticize some wrong ideas, which has played a great role in promoting learning.

　　怎样发动机关干部学习
    ——华北公路局领导学习竞赛经验
    先立志
    华北公路局学习人民政协文件，发动学习竞赛，选举学习模范，现在已经结束。这次学习运动中，一般同志都有显著的进步。以前每天早上学习时候迟到的人很多，经过这次学习运动以后，迟到的人数则极少了。总务股、材料科、管理段、会计科等单位，自动组织了学习会，分成几个互助小组，把文化理论水平较低的同志分散到各个小组里面去，使他们能得到更多的帮助，并且重新作了一个月的学习计划。一月以后，将以民主评定的方式，再选出学习模范。现在很多同志，自己买书籍，订杂志；到图书馆去找参考材料的人也增多了。同志与同志之间，也更亲密团结了。以前每个星期六下午的生活检讨会，大家都感到缺乏内容，提的意见总是老一套。经过这次学习以后，大家在思想上都提高了一步，方法上也灵活得多了。上星期六下午，文书股、总务股、行政科、人事处等单位的同志，自动组织起来到外面去旅行，把生活检讨会搬到北海、天坛去开，在生动活泼的气氛下解决了很多思想问题。此外，大家的劳动观点也增强了，公路局门前的马路很坏，走起来很不方便，职工会发动全体同志用业余的时间去修理，预计六天的工程，三天就完成了。这些事实证明：经过这次学习运动，同志们都有了很大的收获。领导上对于怎样展开干部学习，也得到了一些经验，综合起来，有下面几点：
    　　　　（一）掌握机关学习的特点
    学校的任务就是领导同学学习；在机关里，主要的任务是工作，我们学习的目的，亦是为了提高干部工作能力，保证行政任务的完成。所以机关的学习，一定要配合着行政的任务，在时间上决不要与工作时间冲突。在这样的原则下来进行职工干部的理论与思想教育，才能收到一定的成绩。以前这里领导学习的同志，就忽略了这一点，他们不照顾行政上一切任务与条件，自己单独地搞出一套学习计划来，在办公的时间内，常召集小组长开会和学委干事会，这样就耽误了行政上给这些小组长与干事们的工作任务。于是各单位的行政领导干部，就对他们有了意见，这些同志们，整天忙碌，反而受到了批评，于是感到推动学习是精神上的一种负担，渐渐地，再要召集小组长会或学委干事会，他们就不愿参加了，这样就造成了上下不通气的现象。领导学习的人，掌握不住学习小组长，要想把学习推动搞好，那是不可能的事情。所以机关中领导学习，一定要与行政任务配合，决不要自己单独搞一套，小组长会议不要随时召开，开会必先有充分地准备，用极短的时间，很快地解决问题，开会时间最好不占办公时间，这样，才能使学习不妨碍工作，并保证学习的顺利推动。
    　　　　（二）上下一致，深入动员
    机关的行政领导干部，往往因为行政工作忙，就忽视了对学习的掌握领导，这也是机关学习工作不易搞好的主要原因之一。这次我们发动学习竞赛，是上下一致，深入动员的。首先，由局长召开局务会议，专门讨论学习问题，决定逐级负责：哪一个单位学习不好，就由哪一个单位的行政干部负责检讨；党员学习不好，不能起带头作用，由党内特别批评教育。这样一来，纠正了以前行政领导干部忽视学习的偏向，大家都到群众中去深入动员，帮助同志们找参考材料，于是同志们的学习情绪就更提高了。这次管理科能得到团体学习模范，科长同志领导得好是一个主要的原因，他首先能起带头作用，早上来得最早，下班的时候，与同志们在一块谈谈玩玩，所以管理科的同志们都非常团结，无论学习与工作都搞得很好。
    　　　　（三）发动竞赛，提高情绪
    选举学习模范，是推动学习的一种方法。所以在大家的情绪初步提高以后，可以提出选举学习模范的口号，这样可使大家的情绪，再提高一步。选举的方法是最好发动大家来民主评定，并且要把帮助别人与工作表现列为评定条件，以防止学习中只顾自己，不管别人，脱离群众的偏向，并同时选举单位模范。
    　　　　（四）实行表扬与批评制度
    大家的情绪提高以后，要好好地掌握领导，不能任其自流。平时学习松懈的单位，只要稍有改进，就应当给以适当地表扬鼓励；平常学习较好的单位，应当培养他作为模范，号召大家向他学习。这次我们的运动中，因为总务股平时比较松懈，他们有改进，我们就在黑板报上表扬，他们的情绪就更高了，作出学习计划，买杂志，找参考材料，并且向大家提出了挑战与保证。材料科工作忙，学习情绪松，迟到的人很多，我们就提出适当的批评，他们就自己开会检讨，情绪也提高了；后来他们组织互助小组，创造了分组集体学习的新方法。管理科学习情绪很好，所以就培养鼓励他们，号召其他单位向他们学习，带动了全体的学习情绪。
    　　　　（五）要有准备地开好给奖大会
    选举模范的目的，是在提高大家的学习情绪，以便推动学习，但是往往会发生为选举模范而学习的偏向。所以在给奖大会上，应该预先好好地准备，要适当地表扬一些好的典型，批判一些不正确的思想与偏向，作一个全面的总结报告。最好培养一些好的典型，让他们自己来报告他们的学习方式方法和经验。同时亦找出一些学习得坏的典型，让他们自己来作检讨，这样可以鼓励着大家的学习情绪，而且又批判了一些错误思想，这对推动学习是起了很大的作用。
