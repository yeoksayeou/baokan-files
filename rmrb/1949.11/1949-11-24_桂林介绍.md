　　Guilin is located on the southern edge of the Five Ridges, bordering the west bank of the Gui River. It is the capital of Guangxi Province and also the old nest of the Li Bai bandit gang. Strategically situated on the transportation artery between Hunan and Guangxi, the Xiang-Gui-Qian Railway and the Xiang-Gui Highway pass through it. Water transport extends upstream to Hunan and downstream to Cangwu, making transportation very convenient. Goods from Hunan, Guizhou, and Guangdong, as well as locally produced rice, silk, paper, and oil, are all distributed here. The handicraft industry is most prosperous in weaving, knitting, and dyeing, and there are also light industries such as textiles, machinery, chemicals, leather making, and flour milling. The city boasts clear lake scenery, and the surrounding peaks are steep and beautiful. In the suburbs are scenic spots such as Guishan, Duxiu Peak, Fubo Mountain, Fengdong Cave, and Seven Star Crags, which have been praised since ancient times as "Guilin's landscape is the best in the world." Guilin also has a relatively developed culture and education, with Guangxi University and Guilin Normal College being specialized institutions of higher learning. In the early period of the Anti-Japanese War, the population once surged to 300,000. Subsequently, it suffered severe destruction by the Japanese invaders. After the end of the Anti-Japanese War, it was devastated by the Kuomintang reactionaries. The city gradually declined, all industries were sluggish, and the population decreased to 200,000. According to statistics from the pseudo-Guilin Municipal Government in 1948, there were more than 15,000 unemployed citizens, more than three times the number in 1946. Airports were built in Yantang, Ertang, Lijia Village, and Duijia Village near Guilin, which served as one of the Southwest Air Force bases during the Anti-Japanese War.

　　桂林介绍
    桂林位于五岭南麓，濒桂江西岸，为广西省会，亦李白匪帮之老巢。地当湘桂交通要道，湘、桂、黔铁路、湘桂公路均经其地，水运上溯湖南，下达苍梧，交通向称便利，湘、黔、粤之商货以及附近出产之米、丝、纸类及油类等，均集散于此。手工业以织布、针织、染色为最盛，并有纺织、机械、化学、制革、面粉等轻工业。市内湖光清漪，附近峰峦峭丽，市郊有桂山、独秀峰、伏波山及风洞、七星岩等名胜，自古有“桂林山水甲天下”之誉。桂林文化教育亦较发达，专科以上学校有广西大学及桂林师范学院。抗日战争初期人口曾骤增至三十万。其后遭受日寇之严重破坏，抗日战争结束后又受国民党反动派之摧残，该市日趋凋零，百业不振，人口减少至二十万。据一九四八年伪桂林市政府统计，无业市民达一万五千余人，较一九四六年增加三倍之多。桂林附近之秧塘、二塘、李家村、杜家村均筑有飞机场，抗日战争时曾为西南空军基地之一。
