　　Xiao Ming, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions, Broadcasts
　　Calling on Workers to Work Hard in Production and Study
　　Implementing the Resolutions of the People's Representatives Conference
　　[This newspaper's dispatch] Xiao Ming, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions, gave a speech on November 28th on the second station of the Beijing Xinhua Broadcasting Station, entitled "The City's Workers Continue to Work Hard to Resolutely Support and Implement the Resolutions of the Second Beijing People's Representatives Conference," which stated:
　　The Second Beijing People's Representatives Conference executed the powers of the People's Representatives Conference and passed two resolutions closely related to the workers of our city, namely, the establishment of spare-time supplementary schools and the relief of unemployed workers. This is the expression of the concern of the Beijing People's Representatives Conference for the welfare of our workers, and we workers should wholeheartedly support and implement it.

　　In addition, there are several things that our Beijing workers should do:

　　First, develop production.

　　In the past three months, the workers of Beijing, as masters of the country, consciously and actively implemented the resolutions of the First People's Representatives Conference. We contributed a great deal to the recovery and development of production. Many workers voluntarily worked overtime, and significant achievements were made in reducing costs and improving quality. For example, in the two months from August to October, the clothing factory workers rushed to complete more than 420,000 sets of winter military uniforms. The original production rate was only four or five sets per person per day, but now it has increased to seven or eight sets, with the highest increasing to twelve sets. The quality has also improved by 30% to 40% compared to the Kuomintang era. In the Kuomintang era, only 30 stitches were sewn in a length of less than two inches, but now it is generally done with 45 stitches. The achievements in saving are also very good. In the Kuomintang era, the thread issued according to regulations was not enough, but now the workers consciously save, and this time a total of 36 bundles of thread and more than 1,700 bolts of cloth were saved, equivalent to about 450,000 jin of millet. In addition, in three months, seven cars saved more than 2,000 gallons of gasoline. In the production competition, more than 170 labor models emerged. For example, the average output of the People's Printing Factory also increased by 28.5%, some departments increased by 50% to 80%, and individual departments increased by 100%, and waste materials decreased from 13% to about 4%, breaking historical records. But we must not be satisfied with these. We must further promote the working attitude of our working class as masters, launch a warm and glorious production competition movement, and everyone must conscientiously abide by labor discipline, complete or even exceed production tasks, and strive to create all kinds of new records, strive to be a model of competition, and strive for greater achievements in production and construction. In addition, we should cooperate with the administration to effectively carry out mass production and savings movements, establish factory management committees, and gradually realize the democratization of factory management, in order to achieve the goal of low cost, good quality, and large quantity. In private factories and industries, collective labor-capital contracts should be signed according to the different conditions of various industries. In short, whether private or public, we must achieve the goal of developing production, prospering the economy, and building a new Beijing and a new China. However, the war has not yet ended, and construction has just begun. There will be some difficulties in raw materials and sales. Therefore, some public factories and private capitalists require to dismiss some workers in order to improve management. As long as it is legal and approved by the Labor Bureau, we agree. Workers who are dismissed in this way can enjoy government unemployment relief and receive 50% to 70% of their original wages as relief money, but they should go to work as soon as there is a job opportunity to reduce the burden on the people and increase the wealth of the entire country and society.

　　Second, continue to establish and consolidate trade unions.

　　Workers who have already been organized should take production as their primary task. Combined with launching production competitions, rectify trade union groups, because trade union groups are the basic organizations of the trade union. We must enrich and activate group life and implement the idea of everyone running the trade union in order to do a good job in the trade union. Workers who have not been organized should be organized from top to bottom according to industry; the election of trade union cadres must fully display democracy and lay the foundation for contacting the masses from the beginning; after the establishment of the trade union, membership dues must be collected. Membership dues are an expression of a member's responsibility and obligation to the trade union. Only when the trade union gradually becomes financially independent can it be said that the trade union is run by the workers themselves. I hope that the workers truly regard the work of the trade union as their own work, because organizing the trade union and consolidating the trade union has a decisive role in uniting the class and completing the task of developing production.

　　Third, actively participate in spare-time schools and intensify learning.

　　Our workers warmly welcome the upcoming spare-time school classes passed by this People's Representatives Conference. In the past, we did not have the opportunity to study. Now the People's Government has specially established spare-time schools for us. We must seize this opportunity to study hard, not only to learn culture and technology, but also to learn how to manage factories and the country. Therefore, our workers should actively participate in the various levels of spare-time school classes according to their own level, and strive to improve their class consciousness, political, cultural, and technical level, and working ability, so that these tasks can be done more smoothly, faster, and better.

　　Comrades, workers of the whole city: Through this People's Representatives Conference, the people of Beijing have further and more practically and directly managed the regime themselves. The question now is how to implement and carry out the various resolutions of this conference. However, since the entire revolutionary war has not yet ended and various constructions are still beginning, there are still many difficulties on our road forward. But we firmly believe that with our own strong organization, with the united strength of the people of all walks of life, and with the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we will surely overcome these difficulties with the traditional, most steadfast, heroic and diligent spirit and build our new Beijing!

　　京总工会筹委会主任萧明播讲
  　号召工人努力生产学习
    执行各界代表会议决议
    【本报讯】北京市总工会筹委会主任萧明，十一月二十八日在北京新华广播电台第二台讲演，题为“全市工人继续努力坚决拥护与执行北京市第二届各界人民代表会议的决议”，略称：
    北京市二届各界人民代表会议，执行了各界人民代表大会的职权，并通过了与我们全市工人有密切关系的两项决议案，就是开办业余补习学校，和救济失业员工，这是京市各界人民代表会议对我们工人福利处处关心的表现，我们工人应很好的拥护与执行。
    另外，我们北京市工人还有几件应该做的事情：
    第一、发展生产
    过去三个月中，我们北京市工人曾以主人翁的身份自觉地积极执行第一届各界人民代表会议的决议，在恢复和发展生产方面，我们贡献了很大的力量，很多工友自动加班干活，在减低成本提高质量等各方面，都获得了显著成绩。例如被服厂在八月到十月两个月中，工友们突击完成了四十二万多套冬季军装，生产率原来每人每天只做四、五套的，现在都增加到七、八套，最高的增加到十二套；质量也比国民党时候提高了百分之三十到四十，不到二寸的长度里，国民党时候只缝三十多针就算了，现在一般都做到四十五针；节约方面的成绩也很好，国民党时候照规定发的线不够用，现在工友们自觉地节约，这次共节省了三十六捆线，一千七百多匹布，共约合四十五万斤小米，此外，在三个月中，七辆汽车节省了二千多加仑汽油；在生产竞赛中还涌现了一百七十多位劳动模范。又如人民印刷厂平均产量也增加了百分之二十八点五，有些部门增加了百分之五十到八十，个别的到百分之百，而且废料由百分之十三减到百分之四左右，冲破了历史上的纪录。但是我们不要满足于这些，我们要更加发扬我们工人阶级主人翁的劳动态度，开展热烈光荣的生产竞赛运动，人人都要认真遵守劳动纪律，完成甚至超过生产任务，努力创造各种各样的新纪录，争取作竞赛的模范，争取在生产建设上更大的成就。此外，还应该配合行政，有效地开展群众性生产节约运动，建立工厂管理委员会，逐步实现工厂管理民主化，以达到成本低、质量好、数量多的目的。在私营各工厂行业方面，要按照各种行业不同的情况，订立劳资集体合同。总之无论私营和公营都要达到发展生产、繁荣经济、建设新北京和新中国的目的。但是现在战争尚未结束，建设刚开始，原料推销等方面都会发生些困难，所以有部分公营厂方和私营资方因为改善经营要求解雇一部分工人，只要合法经过劳动局批准，我们是同意的，被这样解雇的工人，可享受政府失业救济，得到原来工资百分之五十到七十的救济金，但是一有工作机会的时候就应该去就业，以减轻人民的负担和增加整个国家社会的财富。
    第二、继续建立和巩固工会
    已经组织起来的工人要以生产为主要任务。与发动生产竞赛相结合，整顿工会小组，因为工会小组是工会的基层组织，一定要充实活跃小组生活，实行大家办工会，才能搞好工会工作。未组织起来的工人，要自上而下的按行业组织；选举工会干部一定要充分发挥民主，一开始就打下了联系群众的基础；工会成立后，一定要征收会费，会费是表示会员对工会的一种责任与义务，工会逐步走向经费独立了，才能表示出工会是工人自己办理的。希望工人们真正把工会工作当作自己的工作，因为组织起工会巩固工会，是团结阶级本队，在完成发展生产的任务上有它的决定作用。
    第三、踊跃参加业余学校加紧学习
    我们工人对这次各界人民代表会议所通过的行将开办的业余学校班次表示热烈欢迎，过去我们没有机会读书，现在人民政府特为我们开办了业余学校，我们要抓住这个机会好好学习，不但学习文化技术，还要学会管理工厂与国家。所以我们工人更应该按照自己的程度，踊跃参加业余学校的各级班次，努力提高自己的阶级觉悟，政治、文化、技术水平和工作能力，以便使这些工作更顺利更快更好地作起来。
    全市工人同志们：经过这一届各界人民代表会议，北京市人民已经更进一步的自己切实直接管理政权了，今后的问题就是怎样执行并贯彻这次会议的各项决议。但由于整个革命战争尚未完结，各种建设尚在开始，因此我们前进的道路上还有很多困难，但我们坚决相信，有我们自己的坚强组织，有各界人民的团结力量，有中国共产党和毛主席的正确领导，我们一定能以传统的最坚定的英勇勤劳精神，克服这些困难，建设我们的新北京！
