Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 24th: The preparatory committee of the All-China Federation of Social Science Workers Representatives Conference, the preparatory committee of the All-China First Natural Science Workers Representatives Conference, the All-China Federation of Literary Workers Association, the preparatory committee of the All-China Education Workers Representatives Conference, and the preparatory committee of the All-China Journalists Association, held a joint welcome meeting at 8:30 tonight to welcome Louis Saillant, Secretary-General of the World Federation of Trade Unions, members of the Executive Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions, and representatives from various countries attending the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference. At the meeting, Wu Yuzhang delivered a welcome speech on behalf of the five organizations, followed by speeches by Toledano, a member of the Executive Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions, and Li Beiming (writer), a representative from North Korea. In his speech, Toledano emphasized that mental and manual laborers must be combined. Li Beiming's speech briefly introduced the state of literary and artistic work in North Korea. Representatives of the five organizations presented flowers to Saillant, Soloviev, and others at the meeting.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 24th: Representatives from various countries attending the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference today visited Changxindian Railway Machinery Factory, Shijingshan Power Plant, Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, Clothing Factory, Telecommunications Bureau, Renli Carpet Factory, Houchsheng Match Factory, People's Printing Factory and other major factories in the capital, as well as Tsinghua University in groups. Workers and students greeted these international friends from thousands of miles away with great enthusiasm and cordiality. When Soviet representative Besonov, Vietnamese representative Liu Defu, and others arrived at Changxindian, they were repeatedly lifted high by the welcoming workers lining the streets. Grand welcome meetings were held in various factories and schools. The representatives expressed their respect and congratulations for the historic victory of the Chinese People's Great Revolution led by the Chinese working class. They unanimously believed that the victory of the Chinese people was also their own victory and a significant force for consolidating world peace. They hoped that the Chinese working class would make greater efforts on the production front to consolidate and expand this victory. The workers of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant actively produced to welcome the convening of the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference. Since the All-China Federation of Trade Unions issued the notice that the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference would be held in Beijing, they worked overtime overnight and completed the large funnel of the ore screening plant and the two projects of the light oil refining plant one month ahead of schedule. The workers of the Shijingshan Power Plant worked two hours of voluntary overtime every day, clearing more than 1,000 tons of scrap iron and accumulated soil, and repaired the 14th boiler two weeks ahead of schedule. During the visit, the representatives of the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference exchanged experiences in revolution and construction with the workers of various factories. When they parted, everyone was reluctant to leave. Besonov said to the railway workers of Changxindian: Your cordial hospitality makes me feel that I am not in another country, but in a big family. I wouldn't mind staying here for a week. Sri Lankan representative Weikemaqinge said to the workers of the clothing factory: I will definitely bring the successful experience of your fight against the enemy to the people of Sri Lanka. The people of our two countries and the people of all countries must unite more closely and strive to liberate the oppressed people of the world!
