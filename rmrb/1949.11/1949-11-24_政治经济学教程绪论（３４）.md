    Secondly, after the victory of the revolutionary war and the liberation of a region or city, the implementation of military control, that is, the implementation of the wartime people's democratic dictatorship, how to take over the huge and complex economic institutions, protect all state property and material resources, and quickly restore production, how to supply the daily necessities for millions of people in the city, how to lead and manage various industrial and commercial and transportation undertakings, and how to lead and manage trade and financial undertakings, etc., are all urgent problems that need to be solved correctly and specifically. In addition to paying attention to taking over various economic institutions and handling military supplies, military control personnel must also understand the specific actual situation of the national economy of the entire region or the entire city, must understand the specific actual situation of each department and link of the national economy, and their development changes, must understand the economic situation of all classes of society and their dynamics and requirements, must be able to correctly grasp the party's policies and the laws of the people's democratic regime, formulate various methods and measures related to industry, commerce, trade, finance, taxation, etc., quickly and correctly handle the restoration and development of urban industrial and commercial production, organize and lead the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas and between inside and outside, correctly handle the relationship between public and private, labor and capital, and between public and private and labor and capital, all of which cannot be competently fulfilled without a certain and sufficient knowledge of political economics.
    Political Economics and Revolutionary Financial and Economic Work
    Marxism-Leninism political economics, like philosophy, is not only a weapon of knowledge, but also a weapon of revolutionary struggle, that is, a weapon of practice. The basic task of the government in the rear during the war is to "develop production and ensure supply." This basic task of the revolutionary regime during the war is also the basic task and basic policy of the revolutionary financial and economic work during the war, which occupies an extremely important position in the work of the revolutionary regime during the war. In the entire financial and economic work, the work of national economic construction to develop production occupies a primary position. The task of the entire financial and economic work is to organize the production and reproduction of the entire national economy, and to organize the distribution and redistribution of the entire national economy after the production process is completed.
    However, in terms of economic construction, on the one hand, there is rural economic construction, and on the other hand, there is urban economic construction, as well as the exchange and mutual assistance between the two. Only through economic construction can production be developed, can there be exchanges, can mutual assistance be carried out, can the economy be prospered, can distribution be entered after production, can the war be supported, can various supplies for military and civilian use in the front and rear be solved, can the victory of the war be guaranteed, and only in this way can the society be guided to develop and progress, can the people's lives be improved and raised, can a truly independent, free, democratic, unified, prosperous, and strong new China be built, so that China can move from a backward agricultural country to a modernized industrial country, and can prepare all the conditions for transitioning to a higher-level socialist society.
    In specific economic work, the division of labor is detailed, the types are numerous, and the process is complex. They include the entire economic process from production to exchange, distribution, and even consumption. From the industrial division of labor, there are roughly distinctions between agriculture, forestry, industry, mining, animal husbandry, fishery, handicrafts, transportation, etc. In addition, there are commercial trade and finance belonging to the circulation process, and departments and divisions of labor belonging to the distribution process such as finance and taxation. Each of these production departments runs through the entire process and influences and restricts each other. Each process is accompanied by and connected to other departments and processes.
    From the perspective of economic composition, in the new democratic society after the complete victory of the revolution, there will be distinctions between various economic compositions such as the state-owned economy, the cooperative economy, the state capitalist economy, the private capitalist economy, and the individual economy. Before the revolution is completely victorious, there will still be remnants of the old economy. In terms of the large object of economic work, in addition to the internal economic work, that is, the economic work within the liberated areas or the new democratic country, there is also foreign economic work. In foreign economic work, it can be divided into two types: one is the equal and friendly foreign economic relations between the Soviet socialist country and the fraternal new democratic countries in the East and Europe, and the other is the relations with the hostile imperialist countries and their vassal states. Before the domestic enemies are completely eliminated, the economic struggle against the enemy also has two aspects: internal and external, that is, the struggle against foreign imperialist economic aggression and the struggle against the remnants of the old economic forces in the country. This struggle between hostile economies is extremely cruel and sharp, and is also quite long-term. Finally, even among the various economic compositions of the new democracy, they cannot completely "peacefully coexist" and "live in peace with each other," but there is both unity and struggle. Therefore, the economic struggle is extremely complex and multi-faceted, and the policies cannot be the same. In the struggle, the mutual coordination of political and economic forces is also needed. In addition, the enemy often has relatively rich experience and is cunning and changeable. The methods of struggle will be diverse, either open or hidden. Most of our revolutionary people are emerging classes, so they are often relatively inexperienced at the beginning. However, the new democratic economic construction and the new democratic economy can only develop in the continuous struggle with these internal and external, open and hidden enemies. Therefore, in addition to being familiar with, mastering, and being proficient in the business knowledge and technical abilities of various economic work, learning, exercising, and strengthening ourselves in practical work, we must also have rich and profound knowledge about the theory and practice of political economics, criticize erroneous economic viewpoints, in order to win the victory of the struggle and truly develop and strengthen the new democratic economy. Therefore, the study of financial and economic work, and the study of political economics that must accompany it, has great realistic significance for the struggle in the current stage of the Chinese revolution.

  　政治经济学的研究对象任务及其特点

　　第三章　政治经济学的任务意义与中国革命
　　第三节　马列主义政治经济学与中国革命
    其次，在革命战争胜利，解放一个地区或城市以后，实行军事管制，即实行战时的人民民主专政，这里怎样接收庞大复杂的经济机构，保护一切国家财产与物质资材，迅速恢复生产事业，怎样供给城市数十百万广大人民日用必需品的需要，怎样领导与管理各种工商业、交通运输事业，以及怎样领导与管理贸易金融事业等等，都是紧迫需要正确而具体地解决的问题。可以军事管制人员除应注意接管各种经济机构与办理军事上的供应以外，还必须了解整个地区或整个城市国民经济的具体实际情况，必须了解国民经济各个部门各个环节的具体实际情况，与它们的发展变化，必须了解社会各阶级的经济状况与它们的动态和要求，必须能够正确地掌握党的政策与人民民主政权的法令，制定各种有关工业、商业、贸易、金融、税收等各种办法措施，迅速正确地处理恢复与发展城市工商业生产，组织与领导城乡间以及内外间物资交流等问题，正确地处理公私间与劳资间及公私与劳资相互间的关系，这些也都不是对于政治经济学没有一定的足够的知识所能胜任愉快的。
    政治经济学与革命的财经工作
    马列主义政治经济学与哲学一样，不仅是认识的武器，同时也是革命的斗争的武器，即实践的武器。战时后方的政府的基本任务，是在“发展生产，保障供给”，这一战时革命政权的基本任务，同时也就是战时革命的财经工作的基本任务与基本方针，它在战时革命的政权工作占着极其重大的地位。而在整个财经工作中，发展生产的国民经济建设工作，却又是占着首要的地位。整个财经工作的任务便在于组织整个国民经济的生产与再生产，并在生产过程完结以后组织整个国民经济的分配与再分配。
    但是在经济建设方面，一方面有农村的经济建设，另一方面有城市的经济建设，以及它们两方面的交流互助。通过经济建设，才能发展生产，才能有所交流，才能进行互助，才能繁荣经济，才能于生产之后进入分配，才能支援战争，才能解决前方后方军需民用的各种供给，才能保证战争的胜利，并且也只有这样才能引导社会向前发展进步，才能改善与提高人民生活，才能建设一个真正独立自由民主统一富强的新中国，使中国从落后的农业国进到近代化的工业国，才能准备一切条件过渡到更高级的社会主义社会去。
    在具体的经济工作中，是分工细致，种类繁多，过程复杂，它们包括着从生产到交换、分配、以至消费的整个经济过程，从产业上分工，大体上有农业、林业、工业、矿业、畜牧业、水产业、手工业、交通运输业等区别，此外还有属于流通过程的商业贸易，金融业，与属于分配过程的财政、税务等部属与分工。它们每一种生产部门都贯穿着整个的过程，并且相互影响相互制约着。而每一个过程又伴随连带着其他各个部门与各个过程。
    从经济构成上说来，在革命完全胜利以后新民主主义社会将有国营经济，合作经济，国家资本主义经济与私人资本主义经济，个体经济等各种经济构成的区别，在革命尚未彻底胜利以前，还会有旧经济残余存在。在经济工作大的对象上说来，除了内部的经济工作，即解放区或新民主国家内部的经济工作以外，还有对外的经济工作，而对外的经济工作中，又可分为两种，一种便是对苏联社会主义国家及东方与欧洲新民主主义兄弟国家间的平等友好的对外经济关系，一种便是与敌对的帝国主义国家及其附庸国间的关系。在国内敌人还没有完全消灭以前，对敌经济斗争也有对内对外两个方面，即对外国帝国主义经济侵略的斗争与对国内的旧经济的残余势力的斗争。而这种敌对的经济间的斗争，又是异常残酷而尖锐，并且相当长期性的。最后即使在新民主主义的各种经济构成间，也不是完全可以“和平共居”“相安无事”的，而是有团结又有斗争的。因此经济斗争又是异常复杂与多方面的政策也不能是一样的。斗争中还需要着政治的与经济的各种力量的相互配合，加以敌人往往是有比较丰富的经验，狡猾诡变的，斗争的方式又将是多种多样的，或者是公开的，或者是隐蔽的，而我们革命的人民大众，大部分是新兴的阶级，所以往往在开始时又是比较地缺乏经验的，但是新民主主义的经济建设，新民主主义的经济只有在与这些内部的与外部的公开的与隐蔽敌人不断地进行斗争中，才能发展起来。所以我们除了必须在实际工作中熟悉掌握精通各种经济工作的业务知识与技术能力学习锻炼加强自己以外，还必须具备丰富的深刻的关于政治经济学理论与实践的知识，批判错误的经济观点，才能取得斗争的胜利，才能使新民主主义经济真正发展壮大起来。因此财经工作的学习，与伴随着它必须的政治经济学的学习，在中国革命的现阶段说来，是有莫大的现实的斗争的意义的。
