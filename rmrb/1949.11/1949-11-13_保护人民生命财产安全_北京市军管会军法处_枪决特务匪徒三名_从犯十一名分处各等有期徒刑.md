    To protect the people's lives and property, the Beijing Military Control Commission's Military Law Office, in order to implement the resolution of the Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference to resolutely suppress special agents and bandits, and protect the people's lives and property, based on the investigation results and public prosecution by the Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau, held a military trial for the Kuomintang special agent bandits Wang Xiyun (female), Tong Baogong, Tang Qi, and other three who disturbed the people and seriously disrupted revolutionary order, sentenced them to death, and executed them by firing squad at 3:00 PM on November 12th. The accomplices Huang Jian, Zhang Huanran, Zhang Shugong, Tian Baogang, and other eleven were sentenced to various terms of imprisonment. Fugitives Jia Zhensheng, Yang San, and others will be dealt with separately upon apprehension.
    Wang Xiyun was originally the wife of Li Mingzhou, a pseudo-National Assembly representative. She privately hid four short guns in her home and plotted an armed robbery before liberation, which failed. After liberation, not only did the criminal not automatically hand over the privately hidden guns, but she also conspired and colluded with Tong Baogong and Zhang Huanran, Kuomintang Military Intelligence Bureau special agents who had suppressed the labor movement, harmed revolutionary cadres, and coerced workers to join bandit gangs in Tangshan, refusing to register for self-renewal; and Kuomintang scattered soldiers Huang Jian, pseudo-police Yang Yinquan, and other five people, to organize armed robbery, deliberately disrupting revolutionary order. Under the instigation of the principal offender Wang Xiyun, since March 4th, under the guise of "checking household registrations," they successively carried out robberies in Xidan Pica Hutong and other places, robbing a large amount of silver dollars, leather clothing, and other valuable property, and also bound the victims and subjected them to cruel tortures such as branding with red-hot irons, which was extremely brutal. The Municipal Public Security Bureau, in order to protect the people's lives and property, successively arrested all of them and seized five short guns.
    Tang Qi served as a pseudo-squad leader and platoon leader in the Kuomintang local special agent armed forces in Wuqing County, extorting conscripts and grain, and harming the people. When Wuqing was liberated, the criminal, fearing punishment, carried a pistol and five bullets and fled to Tianjin. After the liberation of Tianjin, the criminal not only did not register and repent, but also dared to collude with scattered soldiers Zhang Shugong, Liang Hongqi, Liu Jiqing, Li Guobi, and local ruffians Tian Baogang, Zhang Shiqi, Zhao Wenbo, Zhang Wanrong, Ma Youlan, Wang Yingjie, Tang Xu (female), Li Yanjun, Jia Zhensheng, Yang San, and others. The criminal masterminded and organized armed robberies, starting from the beginning of February, successively carrying out three robberies in Tianjin. Later, the criminals, fearing exposure, fled to Beijing one after another, gathering at night and dispersing during the day, and recruited Liu Yu to participate in the robbery. From February 21st, they successively carried out six robberies in Dongsi Wutiao Houkeng, Sifabu Street, Dongdan Xiguanyin Temple, Xibiaobei Hutong, Yongguang Temple West Street, and Xiaochang Ertiao, robbing a large amount of diamonds, gold jewelry, watches, silver dollars, etc. Each time they robbed, the bandit Tian Baogang used a gun to intimidate the victims, and once used red-hot fire tongs to burn the arm of Liu Wang, the victim at No. 4 behind Sifabu Street, forcing them to hand over property. After the Municipal Public Security Bureau learned of this, they arrested all the bandits on March 14th, and seized a pistol and five bullets on the spot.
    Now the Beijing Military Control Commission's Military Law Office has sentenced the heinous bandits Wang Xiyun, Tong Baogong, and Tang Qi to death in accordance with the law, in order to serve as a warning and appease public anger. As for other participants in the bandit organization, considering that most of them were coerced to participate, or knew how to repent after being arrested, the People's Government's lenient spirit was still adopted, giving them the opportunity to reform, and dealing with them leniently. Among them, those with more serious crimes: Huang Jian in the Wang case was sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment, Zhang Huanran was sentenced to five years of imprisonment, and Yang Yinquan was sentenced to three years of imprisonment; Zhang Shugong in the Tang case was sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment, Tian Baogang was sentenced to ten years of imprisonment, Liu Jiqing was sentenced to nine years of imprisonment, Liu Yu and Liang Hongqi were each sentenced to seven years of imprisonment, Li Guobi was sentenced to five years of imprisonment, Zhang Shiqi was sentenced to two years of imprisonment, and Zhao Wenbo was sentenced to one year of imprisonment with a two-year reprieve. Fugitives Jia Zhensheng, Yang San, and others are being pursued and brought to justice.
