　　Although my time with Comrade Liang Yunshan wasn't long, I noticed his "loyalty, simplicity, diligence, and activeness" in our daily work.

　　Comrade Liang is a very straightforward person. As soon as he sees a shortcoming in another comrade, he points it out completely, root and branch. At the same time, he asks for advice from everyone he meets:

　　"Comrade, what shortcomings do you see in my work, my life, or my studies?"

　　If someone says he hasn't done well enough in some area, he immediately opens his mouth, smiles, and says, "Caring about comrades! Caring!" If you only say that he's doing well, he'll say, "There's no one without shortcomings, I don't believe it!" His attitude is somewhat unwelcoming.

　　Once a shortcoming is discovered by him, it's like trash in a dustpan, he throws it away completely.

　　Because Comrade Liang is brave in correcting his own shortcomings and offers well-intentioned criticism to others, he not only progresses quickly himself, but also greatly helps other comrades. Comrades often talk about work, current events, and life by his bedside.

　　Once, when Li Bing-san had just been transferred to the section, it was cold, and he was still using a quilt filled with cotton wadding. When Comrade Liang saw this, he immediately tore the cover off another cotton quilt he had and made a cotton quilt for Li Bing-san, placing it on his bed. After Li Bing-san returned from delivering a message, he shook Comrade Liang's hand gratefully, unable to speak.

　　Whenever he has free time, Comrade Liang studies. Especially on Sundays, he rarely goes out to play, and often quietly sits at his small table reading and writing.

　　Comrade Liang has been in the army for three years, and has gone from being illiterate to being able to read newspapers and write letters. Once, Zhang Yong asked him, "How did you learn culture so well, Comrade Liang?" He said, "If you want to learn culture well, you must bury yourself in hard work and not be afraid of difficulties. Ice three feet thick is not formed in a day. Recognize a few characters today, learn one or two sentences tomorrow, and eventually you'll succeed."

　　Indeed, this is Comrade Liang's valuable experience. There's no trick to learning culture, only hard work. Learning culture should be like "an old lady riding an ox cart, steady and strong."

　　This spring, during the battle for Taiyuan, Comrade Liang went to the front lines with the stretcher team. When he was in charge of a stretcher carrying a wounded soldier back, three enemies came over a slope. At that time, he was unarmed, but he had a clever idea. He immediately hid the stretcher in a gully, asked two villagers to take care of the wounded soldier, and took a wooden pole from the stretcher. When the enemy soldiers came near, he shouted, "Surrender and live!" The two enemies were so frightened that they knelt and raised their guns, and as a result, he seized their weapons.

　　Later, when the stretcher team stayed in one place for a long time, they experienced economic difficulties. Comrade Liang led everyone to scrape soil and boil alkali to overcome this difficult period.

　　In May, at the celebration meeting, Comrade Liang was awarded a major merit and a minor merit by his superiors. Now, in his small box, there's a small paper packet that has been peeled layer after layer, which is his meritorious service medal.

　　梁运山同志
    李季
    我和梁运山同志，虽在一块时间不长，但在日常工作中发觉了他的“忠实朴素、勤劳善动”。
    梁同志是个很直爽的人，只要见到别的同志有了缺点，连根带疤一下子就给瞅出来。同时，他一见人就征求意见：
    “同志，见我在工作上，生活上，学习上，有那些个缺点呀？”
    如果人家说他在什么什么地方做得还不够时，他立刻张开嘴，边笑边说：“对同志关心！关心！”如果你只说他不错不错，反而使他说出一句“还有没缺点的人，我才不信呢！”神气上有些不大欢迎。
    缺点一旦被他发觉，如同簸箕里的垃圾，他总是一抛而掉。
    由于梁同志勇于改正自己的缺点，善意批评他人，不但自己进步快，对别的同志们也有很大帮助，战友们经常在他的床铺上谈工作，谈时事，谈生活。
    有一次，李丙三才调到了科内，天寒了，还盖着夹被，梁同志见到这种情形，就连忙把自己另一个棉被撕了套子，给李丙三做了一个棉被，放在了他的床上，李丙三送信回来后感激的握着梁同志的手，说不出话来。
    一有空暇时间梁同志就学习，特别在星期日，他很少出去玩，常常静悄悄地伏在小桌上看书写字。
    梁同志参军三年，从一个大字不识的人，到能看懂报纸，能写信了，有一次张勇问他：“文化怎样就学好了，梁同志？”他说：“要想学习文化好，埋头苦干不怕难，冰冻三尺厚，不是一日寒，今天认识几个字，明天学会一二句，日久天长成了事。”
    的确这是梁同志宝贵的经验，学习文化没别的巧，只有下苦功夫，学习文化要象“老太太，坐牛车，稳当子劲。”
    今年春天打太原，梁同志与担架队开往前线，当他负责一付担架抬着伤员回返时，斜道上过来了三个敌人，当时手无寸铁，他机灵一动，马上把担架掩藏在山窝里，叫两个老乡看护着伤员，在担架上解下一根木棒，等敌军来到附近，便一声呐喊：“缴枪不死！”吓得那两个敌人跪着举着枪，结果，缴枪了。
    后来担架队住的时间长了，经济发生困难，梁同志便带动大家刮土熬碱，度过了这一个困难时期。
    在五月间开庆功会，上级给梁同志记了一大功和一小功，现在在他那小箱子里，有一个揭了一层又一层的小纸包那便是他的立功证章。
