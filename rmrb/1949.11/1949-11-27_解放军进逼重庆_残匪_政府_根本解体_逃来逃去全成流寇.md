Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 26th - As the People's Liberation Army approaches Chongqing, the so-called "government" of the Kuomintang remnant bandit gang, which fled to Chongqing not long ago, has fundamentally disintegrated. According to a Central News Agency dispatch of the 23rd, the puppet Executive Yuan's political affairs meeting passed a so-called "method for the government to implement combat organization," stipulating that some of the bandit government personnel be formed into a "combat cabinet" to move with the army; the other part would flee to so-called "stable places" to "keep documents and handle ordinary matters." In addition to the above two categories of personnel, the majority of the remaining personnel will be forced to join the bandit army units or be dismissed. The Kuomintang reactionary government had already declared its demise on April 23rd of this year when Nanjing was liberated; thereafter, a small group of remnant bandits carried the signboard of the so-called "government" to Guangzhou; after the liberation of Guangzhou, they fled to Chongqing; currently, they have completely become bandits on the run.

  　逃来逃去全成流寇
    【新华社北京二十六日电】当人民解放军逼近重庆之际，不久以前逃到重庆的国民党残余匪帮的所谓“政府”已根本解体。据匪中央社二十三日电称：伪行政院的政务会议通过了所谓“政府实行战斗体办法”，规定匪政府人员一部分编成“战斗体内阁”，随军行动；另一部分则逃至所谓“安定地方”以“保管文件及处理普通事项”。除了上述两项人员外，其余大部人员将被迫参加匪军部队或被遣散。国民党反动政府早在今年四月二十三日南京解放时即已宣告灭亡，其后一小撮残余匪帮把所谓“政府”的招牌抬到了广州；在广州解放后，又逃到重庆；目前则已完全变成流寇。
