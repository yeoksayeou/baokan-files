Dr. Bethune was from Toronto, Canada. In April 1938, he departed from Yan'an, crossed the Yellow River, traversed towering mountains, and broke through enemy blockades, arriving smoothly in our Jin-Cha-Ji Military Region in June.

On June 17th, he arrived at the Military Region Headquarters, and on the 18th, he reached the rear hospital. Although he had just completed a march of over two months, he showed no signs of fatigue and needed no rest; he began working the next day.

In the first week, he examined more than 520 wounded and sick soldiers. Surgery began in the second week, and in the following four weeks, over a hundred wounded and sick soldiers who had been in the hospital for a long time returned to the front lines with renewed health. The following is a brief account of his work in the military region over eighteen months, divided into four periods:

First Period

From July 15th to September 15th, 1938. During these two months, his central work slogan was: "Establish a Model Hospital." He got up early every day and worked tirelessly into the night. In addition to treating the wounded and sick, he also guided carpenters in making traction frames for femur fractures, wooden beds for patients, and many other wooden implements. He also supervised blacksmiths and tinsmiths in manufacturing Thomas splints and tin basins and buckets; he also inspected tailoring workers as they sewed and washed clothes, quilts, and pillows for the wounded. In short, he did not want to have a minute of idle time.

During this time, he divided the hospital into two sections: "Zhongshan Hospital" and "Mao Zedong Hospital," and he also initially deployed all the necessary equipment within the hospital. Thus, the "Model Hospital" was officially inaugurated on September 15th in Songyankou.

Many troops and people attended the unprecedented grand opening ceremony. Song Shaowen, Director of the Border Region Government, and Nie Rongzhen, Commander of the Military Region, were also present. After the meeting, they visited the wards and personally comforted the wounded and sick soldiers.

The establishment of the "Model Hospital" greatly improved the skills of doctors and nurses, especially in terms of surgical dressing and disinfection. The mortality rate of wounded and sick soldiers decreased, while the number of discharged patients increased by more than half. During this period, Dr. Bethune performed surgery on more than 300 wounded and sick soldiers.

Second Period

From September 16th to New Year's Day, 1939. During this period, his central work slogan was: "Create a Special Surgical Hospital." At the end of September, the Japanese invaders began their offensive against the border region. He left the Military Region Hospital on September 25th and arrived at the rear hospital of the Fourth Military Sub-district Health Department on the 28th. Here, he worked for more than a month, performing surgery on more than 60 people, and he also unreservedly criticized all the unfavorable conditions in the hospital, which led to great improvements later.

Then, he personally went to the front lines to participate in rescue work and performed surgery on more than 20 people. He was even more concerned and warmly comforted the masses in the combat area who suffered from the enemy's burning and killing.

In late October, he returned to the Military Region Hospital. At that time, the construction and working methods of the mountain hospital still maintained the tradition and style of his "Model Hospital," which made him very happy! He happily worked here for another week.

On November 9th, he arrived at the first branch of the Military Region Hospital in Yangjiazhuang on the northern front. Before he had worked for three days, he received a telegram from Brigade Commander Wang of the 359th Brigade, informing him of the situation at the front. Upon receiving this news, he rushed to the front lines at night without even eating dinner and carried out initial wound treatment. In this way, he worked in the hospital of the 359th Brigade for more than ten days.

Later, he returned to the first branch. At this time, his central slogan was: "Rapidly complete the construction of the Special Surgical Hospital." At that time, it housed more than 300 seriously wounded soldiers. The treatment of these wounded soldiers was carried out entirely under the personal command and supervision of Dr. Bethune; at the same time, he had to perform surgery on more than ten wounded soldiers every day, change their dressings, and save the lives of many comrades whose injuries were very dangerous. He gave his monthly allowance to them for nutrition and comforted them. In particular, he repeatedly transfused his own blood to wounded soldiers in critical condition. Under his enthusiastic influence, many medical staff and local people also volunteered to donate blood to the wounded soldiers, so Dr. Bethune organized a "Volunteer Blood Donation Team."

On December 15th, the construction of this special surgical hospital was declared complete. The hospital's construction completely maintained the style of the previous model hospital, and in some places even surpassed it. On the 16th, a notice was issued to the health agencies of each military sub-district to send people to visit, and immediately afterward, the internship week of the special surgical hospital opened on January 13th, 1939.

During the internship week, he lectured every morning on various fracture traction methods and surgical operations, and held clinical internships. In the afternoon, he led all the interns in discussion meetings, and in the evening, he held summary meetings. This gave the interns sent by the military sub-districts a wealth of medical knowledge and experience.

The internship week ended, and on January 15th, he went to the First Military Sub-district. At that time, the First Military Sub-district had fewer battles, so he only stayed for one day, performing surgery on two wounded soldiers. The next day, he went to the Third Military Sub-district.

At the Huata Hospital in the Third Military Sub-district, he worked for more than ten days, initially building the Second Special Surgical Hospital. At this time, the battle of Shipenkou in Wutai on the western front broke out, so he immediately rushed back to the Chajianling Military Region Rear Hospital and continued his work. Most of the wounded from Shipenkou underwent surgery by him. During this period, he performed more than 300 surgeries of all sizes.

Third Period

From February 15th to June 30th. During this period, he was approved by the leaders of the military region to work in Jizhong. His central slogan was: "Organize an Eastern Expedition Medical Team to carry out medical and health work in the plain guerrilla warfare." On February 15th, he led eighteen health cadres, holding high the banner of the "Jin-Cha-Ji Military Region Eastern Expedition Medical Team," and braved the cold wind of the north to advance on the Pinghan Road.

On the night of February 19th, they broke through the enemy's blockade line; stepping onto the Jizhong Plain, and arrived at the headquarters of the Jizhong Military Region on the 22nd.

On March 3rd, their medical team arrived at the rear hospital of the Jizhong District and examined more than 200 wounded soldiers in one day, performing surgery on more than 40 people in three days. Then they went to the health department of the 120th Division. No fewer than 60 surgeries were performed that day.

At this time, the enemy was launching a frantic offensive against Jizhong. Most of the wounded soldiers of our troops were dispersed. In order to alleviate the suffering of the wounded soldiers and make the work suitable for the environment of guerrilla warfare, Dr. Bethune decided to divide the medical team into two teams: one for combat area rescue (led by him personally), and one for the rear medical team. In this way, they struggled hard for more than two months.

In early May, the 120th Division fought a major battle with the enemy in Qihui, Hejian. Upon hearing the news, Dr. Bethune immediately rushed to the front lines and performed surgery on more than 200 people for three days and three nights. In particular, one cadre was shot with nine bullets in his abdomen, and within four hours, he was carried to the surgical team. Dr. Bethune performed surgery and he recovered in the shortest time.

Later, with his help, the Jizhong District's own medical team was also established. During this time, Dr. Bethune treated patients during the day, and every night he had to take some time to give lessons to the doctors and nurses, so that they gained a lot of new knowledge. The health work in the Jizhong District, which was originally very weak in terms of personnel and technology, has made great progress with his help. The number of discharges increased, and the number of deaths and disabilities decreased. During this period, he performed surgery on more than 400 people.

Fourth Period

From July to October 20th, 1939. During this period, his central task was to pay attention to the overall work of the entire health agency of the military region. He also put forward many valuable and specific suggestions to the health department of the military region, such as how to create health schools to solve the difficulties of medical cadres, and how to organize health materials factories. Moreover, he personally went outside to collect many medicines and equipment, solving many material difficulties. He also clearly instructed our Military Region Health Department on how to strictly inspect the health agencies of various military sub-districts, promote their work, and how to strengthen the working ability of each cadre. He also described how to wage a merciless struggle against those medical personnel who are not responsible for their work.

From July to September, he concentrated all his energy on compiling books on surgical doctors suitable for the front lines, new books on "Preliminary Wound Treatment," and the "Model Hospital Standard Method," etc. In mid-September, he completed all of these lectures.

On September 18th, he proposed the organization of a Military Region Health Department inspection group to inspect and support the health work of various military sub-districts and troops. There were five members in the group, and most of the heads of the Military Region Health Department participated. On the 25th, they departed from Huapen and first went to the Yujiazhai Hospital, the second branch of the Third Military Sub-district Health Department, to inspect their work. Four days later, they went to the health team of the 2nd Regiment and the health stations of each battalion to conduct inspections, and convened a meeting of all health personnel, where Dr. Bethune instructed them on the use of various splints and battlefield first aid methods.

Then they inspected the health and medical work of the 20th Regiment, the Cavalry Battalion, the 1st Detachment, the Laogu Hospital, and the Jixi Rear Hospital in the Jizhong District.

On October 10th, they went to the First Military Sub-district from Beiqingxing and inspected the work of the health team and health station of the 1st and 3rd Regiments, the health department of the Independent Detachment, and the health agencies of various departments.

The main focus of his work during this period was to: strengthen the connection between the upper and lower levels of the health agency and practically cultivate preliminary medical talents.

In late October, the enemy's "mopping-up" operation against our military region began. The troops of the First Military Sub-district first came into contact with the enemy on the northern front. Like in past battles, Dr. Bethune, upon hearing this news, immediately set out at night and headed north. Three days later, he arrived in Sunjiazhuang, and the next day he began to perform surgery on the wounded soldiers being transported from the front, a total of more than 300 people.

And on this day, the third joint of Dr. Bethune's left middle finger was accidentally cut by a small knife, and he was poisoned.

Unfortunately, the development of the toxin took the life of our beloved international friend and separated him from us forever!

Dr. Bethune's physical body has died, but his spirit will live forever! We will always maintain his spirit in our work and complete the cause he did not finish! (Reprinted from the North China Liberation Army News) (Attached picture)

    白求恩大夫在晋察冀军区工作经过
    白求恩大夫是加拿大脱朗托人。一九三八年四月，他由延安出发，渡过了黄河，越过了重山，冲破了敌人的封锁线，而于六月间顺利的到达了我们晋察冀军区。
    六月十七号到军区司令部，十八号到达了后方医院。当时，他虽然是刚刚经过了两个多月的行军，但他丝毫不觉得疲劳，更不需要什么休息，第二天就开始了工作。
    在第一周内，他一共检查了五百二十多个伤员和病员。第二周开始施行手术，紧接着四个星期的时间，一百多个曾经在医院里停留了很久的伤病员都重新带着健康的身体奔赴前线了。这里，简单的把他在军区十八个月的工作情形分做四个时期叙述在下面：
    第一个时期
    是从一九三八年七月十五日到九月十五日。在这两个月中他的中心工作口号是：建立模范医院。每天他很早就起床，一直不知疲倦地工作到夜晚，除了给伤病员诊治以外，他还要指导木匠工人做大腿骨折牵引架、病人木床以及其他许多木料器具。还要监督铁匠锡匠工人制造许多托马氏铁夹板和洋铁盆桶；还要检查裁洗工人替伤员缝洗衣服被子枕头；总之，他不愿自己有一分钟的时间闲着。
    这时，他把医院内部分成了两个病院，一个是“中山医院”，一个是“毛泽东医院”，同时把医院内部一切应有的设备都初步的布署好了。于是，“模范医院”便在九月十五日于松岩口正式宣告落成。
    在空前盛大的落成典礼会上，有许多部队和人民参加、边区政府宋劭文主任，军区聂荣臻司令员也都莅临了。而且在会后他们参观了病室，亲自慰问了伤病员。
    “模范医院”的成立，对医生看护的技术上大大地提高了一步，尤其是对于外科敷药和消毒方面。伤病员死亡率也减少了，而出院数却增加了半倍以上。这时期，白大夫一共施行了三百多个伤病员的手术。
  第二个时期
    是从九月十六日到一九三九年的元旦。这时期他的工作中心口号：创造特种外科医院。九月底，日寇就开始向边区进攻了。他九月二十五号离开军区医院，二十八号到了四分区卫生部后方医院，在这里他工作了一个多月，施行了六十多人的手术，而且他更不客气的批评了这个医院里的一切不良的情形，使医院后来得到很大的进步。
    接着他就亲自到前线参加救护工作，并施行手术二十多名。对于作战地区群众被敌人烧杀的痛苦，他更关心地亲热地去慰问。
    十月下旬，他回到军区医院，当时山地医院的建设和工作方式，仍保持了他的“模范医院”的传统与作风，这使他感到万分高兴！他愉快地在这里又工作了一个星期。
    十一月九日，他到了军区北线杨家庄军区医院的第一所，工作不到三天，就接到三五九旅王旅长的电报通知他前方战斗的情形，他得到这个消息，连饭都不吃黑夜赶上前线。实施了初步疗伤。这样，他又在三五九旅的医院里工作了十几天。
    后来他回到第一所，这时他的中心口号是：迅速完成特种外科医院建设。当时那里收容了三百多个重伤员，这些伤员的治疗，完全是在白大夫亲自指挥与监督下进行的；同时，每天他都要施行十个伤员以上的手术，并给伤员换药，把许多伤势很危险的同志的生命挽救了。他把自己每月的津贴费送给他们做营养费，安慰他们，尤其是，他曾几次地把自己身上的血输给危险的伤员。在他的热情的影响下，许多医务人员和地方群众也自愿输血给伤员，于是白大夫便组织了“自愿输血队”。
    十二月十五号，这个特种外科医院的建设，宣告完成。关于医院的建设完全保持以前模范医院的作风，某些地方还超过。十六号发出通知，要各分区卫生机关派人来参观，而且紧接着，特种外科医院的实习周便在一九三九年一月十三号开幕了。
    在实习周内，他每天上午讲各种骨折牵引法，外科手术，举行临床实习。下午他领导全体实习员开讨论会，晚上开总结会。使分区派来的实习员得到了许多丰富的医学知识和经验。
    实习周结束了，一月十五日他到了一分区，当时，一分区因为作战较少，所以他只停了一天，施行了两个伤员的手术，第二天便到三分区。
    在三分区的花塔医院，他工作了十多天，初步的建设特种第二外科医院。这时，西线五台石盆口战斗打响了，于是他立刻赶回插箭岭军区后方医院，继续不断的开始了他的工作。石盆口伤员大半经他施行手术，这一时期，他一共行了大小手术三百余名。
  第三个时期
    是从二月十五日到六月三十日。这时期他得到军区首长的批准到冀中去工作，他的中心口号是：组织东征医疗队，开展平原游击战争中的医疗卫生工作。二月十五号，他率领着十八个卫生干部，高举着“晋察冀军区东征医疗队”的旗帜，便冒着北国的寒风，向平汉路上挺进了。
    二月十九日的深夜，他们突过了敌人的封锁线；走上冀中平原，而于二十二日到达了冀中军区的司令部。
    三月三号，他们的医疗队到了冀中区的后方医院，一天内就检查了二百多个伤员，三天内实行了四十多人的手术。接着他们又到了一二零师的卫生部。当天施行手术的也不下六十余人。
    这时敌人正向冀中作疯狂的进攻。我们部队的伤员大部都分散了，白大夫为了减轻伤员的痛苦和使工作适合于游击战争的环境，所以决定把医疗队分成两队，一为作战区域救护之医疗队（本队由他亲自率领），一队为后方医疗队。这样，他们艰苦奋斗了两个多月。
    五月上旬，一二零师在河间齐会与敌大战，白大夫听到消息，立刻赶赴前线，三天三晚，施行了二百多人的手术，特别是有个干部，腹内中了九粒子弹，四点钟内，抬到手术队，由白大夫施行手术，在最短期内得到痊愈。
    后来经过他的帮助，冀中区自己的医疗队也成立起来了。在这个时间里，白大夫白天治疗，每天晚上都要抽出一点时间来给医生看护们上课，使他们获得了不少新的知识。原来在人员技术上都很薄弱的冀中区卫生工作，经过他的帮助，得到了很大的进步。出院增多，死亡残废减少。这一时期，他施行手术四百多名。
  第四个时期
    由一九三九年七月到十月二十日。这时间他的工作中心是注意军区整个卫生机关的全面工作，对军区卫生部也提出许多宝贵的具体的意见，如怎样创设卫生学校解决医务干部的困难，怎样组织卫生材料厂等。而且，他亲自到外边去收集了许多药品器材，解决了不少物质上的困难。他又明确的指示了我们军区卫生部对各分区的卫生机关应如何严格的检查和推动他们的工作，以及如何加强每个干部本身的工作能力，对那些工作不负责任的医务人员应如何的与他们作无情的斗争。
    七月至九月中间，他集中全部精力编著关于外科医生前线适用的书籍和新的“初步疗伤”的书籍以及“模范医院标准法”等，九月中旬，他把这些讲义都全部的完成了。
    九月十八日他提出组织军区卫生部视察团，视察并扶助各分区部队卫生工作，内有团员五人，军区卫生部负责人多数参加。二十五日由花盆出发，首先到第三分区卫生部第二所于家寨医院检查工作。四天以后，又到了二团卫生队及各营卫生所举行检查，并召集全体卫生人员会议，由白大夫指示各种夹板的使用法及战场救护防毒等方法。
    接着他们又检查了二十团、骑兵营、一支队、老姑医院，及冀中区的冀西后方医院的卫生医疗工作。
    十月十日，他们由北清醒到了一分区，检查了一、三团卫生队卫生所，独立支队卫生部以及各部卫生机关的工作情形。
    这一时期他的主要工作中心是：密切卫生机关上下级的联系，实际培养初步的医疗人材。
    十月下旬，敌人向我们军区的“扫荡”开始了，一分区部队首先在北线与敌人开始接触，白大夫和过去作战时一样，他得到这个消息后，立刻黑夜出发，向北前进。第三天到达了孙家庄，第二天就开始为前方运送下的伤员施行手术，一共三百多人。
    而就在这天，白大夫左手的中指第三节，意外的被小刀割伤了，他中了毒。
    不幸，由于毒素的发展夺去了我们敬爱的国际友人的生命而和我们永别了！
    白大夫肉体已死而精神长存！我们将在工作中永远保持着他的精神。完成他未完成的事业！（转载华北解放军报）（附图片）
