　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 25th—Since the beginning of autumn, livestock infectious diseases have occurred successively in some areas of Hebei, Pingyuan, Suiyuan, and Shanxi provinces. After the active organization of forces by governments at all levels to carry out treatment, the development and spread have now stopped. The areas where livestock epidemics occurred reached more than 20 counties. The epidemics were fierce at the beginning. For example, in Xiuwu County, Pingyuan Province, sick livestock were found in six villages simultaneously, numbering more than 400. In He Shun County, Shanxi, more than 200 livestock died in more than 30 villages due to the disease. After the occurrence of livestock epidemics, governments at all levels in various provinces immediately organized veterinary personnel to go to the epidemic areas to actively rescue and treat the animals. The Shanxi Provincial People's Government organized four veterinary teams to rush to the epidemic areas under the jurisdiction of Changzhi, Xinzhou, and Xingxian prefectures to cooperate with local personnel in rescue and treatment. In order to strictly prevent the spread and development of the epidemic, various localities have implemented measures such as blockades and preventive injections in the epidemic areas. The Hengshui Veterinary Epidemic Prevention Team in Hebei Province divided 41 villages around the epidemic area into ten injection zones and injected 3,590 livestock in nine days. In Xiuwu, Pingyuan, more than 400 sick livestock were treated in half a month. According to incomplete statistics from the above nearly 20 counties, a total of more than 1,800 epidemic livestock have been cured, and more than 75,400 livestock have been preventively injected. After such active rescue, treatment and prevention, except for a few areas where the number of deaths was relatively large due to the rapid spread of the disease and lack of timely treatment, there were few deaths in general areas. In order to avoid the continued occurrence of epidemics and facilitate the needs of the masses, Hebei Province has established four veterinary stations in Baoding, Tongxian, Changli, and Xingtai to promptly eliminate possible recurrences of livestock epidemics.

　　河北等地畜疫
  　经积极救治  已停止蔓延
    【新华社北京二十五日电】入秋以来，河北、平原、绥远、山西等省部分地区均先后发生牲畜传染病，经各级人民政府积极组织力量进行救治后，现已停止发展和蔓延。畜疫发生的地区达二十余县，病疫初发生时来势凶猛，如平原省修武县六个村即同时发现病畜四百余头，山西和顺县三十多个村因病致死的牲畜达二百余头。各省各级人民政府在畜疫发生后，立即组织兽医人员分赴疫区积极抢治。山西省人民政府组织了四个兽医大队，赶赴长治、忻县、兴县三个专区所属的病疫区，配合各地人员进行抢治。为了严防病疫蔓延和发展，各地对疫区实行了封锁和注射预防等措施。河北衡水兽疫防治队，在疫区周围四十一个村庄内，划了十个注射区，九天内即注射牲畜三千五百九十头。平原修武半月治疗病畜四百余头。据以上近二十余县的不完全统计，共治好疫畜一千八百余头，预防注射牲畜七万五千四百余头。经过这样积极的抢治和预防，除少数地区因病疫过急、未及治疗死亡数目较大外，一般地区很少死亡。为了避免疫病的继续发生和便利群众需要，河北省在保定、通县、昌黎、邢台设立了四个兽医站，以便及时扑灭可能再次发生的畜疫。
