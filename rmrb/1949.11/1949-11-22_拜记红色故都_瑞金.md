Visiting the Red Capital - Ruijin
	Yan Wei Bing

	To find my younger siblings who remained in the Central Soviet Area during the Long March, I left Chengdu with excitement and a thirst for knowledge to visit the Red Capital - Ruijin.

	From Nanchang to Ruijin, it is more than 1200 li, and the car can arrive in three days. When the Chiang bandits retreated, they completely destroyed the important bridges along the way. To cross the Gan River and Gong River, the car had to be ferried by boat. In Ji'an and Ganzhou, motorboats were used for the ferry, while in places like Jiangkou and Yudu, due to the shallow water, everything relied on manpower, which was troublesome and time-consuming.

	After passing Ji'an, the car gradually entered mountainous terrain. Everyone concentrated on exploring, and in the distance to the right, the black mountain range was the steep peak of Jinggang Mountain! Comrades were all fascinated, singing enthusiastically and happily: "Remember that the Red Army originated in Jinggang Mountain, and now we are always thinking of her... Clouds and mist fill the top of Jinggang Mountain every day, and it looks like waves in the sea from below..." Veteran comrades talked about the hardships of the founders and the story of Commander-in-Chief Zhu's bamboo pole. Everyone was delighted that "red flags are flying in the west wind" again on the pillboxes of Jinggang Mountain.

	Upon entering deeper mountainous terrain, the white camellias on both sides were in full bloom. Young women carrying tea seeds on their shoulders, barefoot and vigorously, appeared and disappeared among the hills. Around the Gong River, September is a unique season; at this time, the tea seeds are ripe, and young men and women go to the mountains to pick tea, which is the best time for them to freely fall in love.

	Ruijin, a city that once shone brightly in history, was liberated on August 23 this year, after being in enemy hands for a full fifteen years. The relics of the Soviet era include: the Red Army Monument, which still stands alone on the hilltop, but the inscription by Chairman Mao on the tower has been destroyed. In Shazhouba, under the dense shade of ancient trees, is Chairman Mao's former residence, but the air-raid shelter behind the house has collapsed. The County People's Government plans to renovate it in the future to restore its original appearance. The Red Army Auditorium was destroyed by the enemy long ago, and only ruins remain.

	Before 1934, the total population of Ruijin County was 330,000. After being liberated again this time, a preliminary survey shows that it is less than 250,000. There are three reasons for the sharp decline in population: (1) During the fifteen years of the Kuomintang's bloody rule, the people of Ruijin suffered three major massacres: The first was in the summer of 1939. In Wuyang District alone, more than 500 people were buried alive by the Kuomintang authorities overnight. The second was after the Southern Anhui Incident. The third was when Liu and Deng went down to Dabie Mountain. More than 5,000 innocent people throughout the county were killed by the Kuomintang authorities one after another. (2) This caused the residents to panic and flee to other counties. (3) The Kuomintang conscripted soldiers year after year, and about 3,000 young adults were captured. Taking Zhian Township—the starting point of the Soviet movement—as an example, after several destructions, the loss of men in the township reached 2,000, resulting in a tragic scene of no one in sight for ten miles and large areas of farmland lying barren.

	After the Red Army's Long March, the landlords and bullies who had been overthrown during the Soviet movement took advantage of the fire, on the one hand, robbing farmers of their land, cattle, houses, etc., and on the other hand, acting as township chiefs and Bao chiefs, colluding with Kuomintang officials to suppress the masses and implement special agent rule. However, the people of Ruijin did not succumb! Their hearts were firmly following Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu. They were waiting for the heroes carrying the red flag to return! In Longtan Village, Huangbai District, old women secretly brought incense and candles to a stone cave on the first and fifteenth days of the lunar month to pray and cry, because the people say that Chairman Mao had convened a cadre meeting there.

	The men went back to the mountains to organize guerrilla teams and carried out guerrilla activities in the most difficult environment of blockade and "encirclement and suppression." They slept in deep mountains, lacked clothing and food, and often ate wild vegetables and grapes to satisfy their hunger. Among them, the Tingrui Guerrilla Brigade led by Comrade Liu Guoxing persisted until 1945! Until Comrade Liu Guoxing was killed by special agents. They created the Guilong Mountain area on the border of Ruijin and Fujian!

	When I visited Wuyangwei, revolutionary old farmers took out their Communist Party of China membership cards, coolie transport union membership cards, work badges, and disability certificates from fifteen years ago and showed them to me. These were documents that they had treasured for fifteen years at the risk of their lives! Some old farmers took out stacks of Soviet banknotes and proposed that the People's Bank redeem the Soviet banknotes at a rate of one to one thousand. Some old farmers took out public bonds, land tax receipts, and cooperative shares, etc. Some old farmers took out political and military books printed in the Soviet era. Although the things had been moth-eaten with thousands of holes, the owners cherished them no less than family land deeds! I said that this batch of precious things was really worth bringing to Beijing. The old farmers all agreed, generously gave all of them to me one by one, and repeatedly told me: "Give it to Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief, and the leaders of the Party Central Committee! Say hello to them for us!" This simple and noble sentiment really moved people, and I accepted their heavy trust. The district people's government issued receipts one by one, and the old farmers dispersed with laughter.

	Today, the older generation of the Ruijin Soviet era is leading the younger generation, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, to work hard to build a new Ruijin! The All-County People's Congress closed on November 7. The current tasks are to support the front line, eliminate bandits in the territory, collect firearms hidden by counter-revolutionaries, oppose bullies, and implement the rent reduction and interest reduction decrees. The 250,000 people of the county are eagerly hoping to restore the city, which has been devastated, to its former peaceful and happy appearance.

	Ruijin produces rice, and there is a saying that "even if there are two bad harvests in three years, there is still grain to be sent down to Ganzhou." However, salt, cloth, and foreign goods are supplied by other provinces and counties. Rice prices are particularly cheap. Coarse japonica rice sells for about 5,400 yuan per shi in RMB, while civil cloth, white cloth, sells for 400 yuan per foot in RMB, and blue and black cloth sells for 550 yuan. An adult's suit of clothes requires two feet six or two feet eight of native cloth. Therefore, farmers must sell two or six dou of grain to exchange for a coarse cloth clothing material. The price of salt is six pounds of grain for one pound of salt.

	Farmers don’t easily grow cotton unless they want to add cotton quilts and cotton clothes to their homes this winter, and then plant some cotton in the spring; they don’t pay attention to cultivation, and cultivate cotton using the method of planting grains, so the yield is extremely low. To solve the difficulty of cloth in the future, we can only adopt the past experience of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region: Promote and reward cotton planting, and run family or village and township textile cooperatives. At the same time, organize the exchange of materials, sell Ruijin rice to other provinces, and exchange it for salt, cloth, and foreign goods. In this way, one will solve the problem of farmers’ clothing, second, make farmers have sideline income; third, will not hurt farmers due to low grain prices. In this way, Ruijin will quickly embark on a path of peace, happiness, prosperity, and abundance!

### 拜记红色故都——瑞金

　　拜记红色故都——瑞金
　　严慰冰
    为了找寻长征时留在中央苏区的弟妹们，带着兴奋与求知的心情，我离开新都，经武汉，去访问红色故都——瑞金。
    从南昌到瑞金，一千二百余华里，汽车三天可到。蒋匪溃退时，把沿路重要桥梁，破坏干净，过赣江过贡水，车子都要用船渡。吉安、赣州、两处有汽艇引渡，而江口、雩都等地，因水浅，则全靠人力，麻烦而且费时间。
    车过吉安，渐次进入山地。大家都凝神探索，在右边遥远处的黑色大岭，便是那井岗山峻陡的峰风！同志们都神往了，热情而愉快地唱着：“记得红军发源就在那井岗山里，现在我们心头老是想着她。……云雾每天弥漫在井岗山头，山下看去好似大海的波涛。……”老同志谈着当年缔造者的艰辛，及朱总司令竹子扁担的故事。大家都欣喜：如今井岗山碉楼上又见“红旗漫卷西风”了。
    待进入更深的山地，两旁白皑皑的茶花正在盛开。年青的媳妇们担着茶子，赤足健步，出没岗峦之间。在贡江周遭，九月是个别致的季节；这时茶子熟了，青年男女都上山打茶，是他（她）们最好的自由恋爱时机。
    瑞金，这个一度在历史上放过异彩的城市，今年八月二十三日解放，沦于敌人之手整十五年。苏维埃时代遗迹有：红军纪念塔，现仍独立山头，惟塔上毛主席提词已毁。在沙洲坝，那古树的浓荫下，是毛主席的故居，只屋后防空洞已坍，县人民政府拟日后加以修整，使恢复当年旧观。红军大礼堂，则已早毁于敌，现仅存残壁。
    一九三四年前，瑞金县总人口是三十三万。此次重获解放后，初步调查不足二十五万，人口锐减原因有三：（一）在国民党血腥统治的十五年间，瑞金人民遭受了三次大屠杀：首次是一九三九年夏，仅武阳区一地，一夜间被国民党当局活埋五百余人。其次是皖南事变后。再次是刘邓下大别山之时。全县无辜被国民党当局杀害者前后逾五千人。（二）因此引起了居民的惶惶不安，纷纷向外县逃避。（三）国民党连年征丁，有三千左右青壮被抓。以治安乡——苏维埃运动的发起点——为例，经这几番摧残，全乡男丁损失达二千人，造成十里不见人烟，耕地大片荒芜的惨象。
    红军长征后，苏维埃运动时被打倒的地主恶霸，便趁火打劫，一方面抢去农民土地、耕牛、房屋等等，一方面充当起乡长、保长，与国民党官府，狼狈为奸，镇压群众，实行特务统治。但是，瑞金的老百姓并没有屈服！他们的心，是牢牢地跟随着毛主席朱总司令。他们在期待：那打着红旗的英雄们回来！在黄柏区龙潭村，村妪们每逢初一、十五间，偷偷带上香烛，跑到一个石洞里去祷告啼哭，因为这个石洞，老百姓传说：毛主席曾在那里召开过干部会议。
    男儿们则又重新上山，组织游击队，在封锁与“清剿”的最艰苦环境下，进行游击活动。露宿深山，缺衣乏食，常用野菜野葡萄果腹。其中刘国兴同志所领导的汀瑞游击大队，一直坚持到一九四五年！直到刘国兴同志被特务杀害为止。在瑞金与福建边境，创造了归龙山区！
    当我去拜访武阳围时，革命的老农们掏给我看：他们十五年前的中国共产党党证，苦力运输工会会员证，工作证章，及残废证。这是他们冒生命之险珍藏了一十五载岁月的证件！有的老农拿出成叠的苏维埃票子，并提议请人民银行以一比一千的价格，收兑苏票。有些老农则拿出公债券，土地税收据，及合作社股票等等。有些老农则拿出苏维埃时代油印的政治、军事书籍，虽则东西已被虫子蛀了万万千千窟窿，但物主对它的珍爱却不亚于传家的地契！我说这批宝贵的东西，实在是值得带到北京的。老农们同声赞成，慷慨将其所有，一一分送给我，并谆谆叮嘱：“送给毛主席、总司令、及党中央首长！替我们问他们好！”这种淳朴崇高的情操，真使人感动，我接受了他们的重托。由区人民政府一一打给收条，老农们嘻笑而散。
    如今瑞金苏维埃时代的老一辈，正率领着年青的一代，在共产党与人民政府的领导下，努力建设新瑞金！全县各界人民代表大会是十一月七日闭幕的。目下的任务是支援前线，肃清境内土匪，收缴反革命分子私藏的枪支，反对恶霸，实行减租减息法令。全县二十五万人民热望着把一个惨遭摧残的城市，恢复当年和平、幸福的景象。
    瑞金产米，有“三年两不收，仍有粮食下赣州”之谚。但食盐、布匹、洋货，则靠外省外县供给。米价特贱，糙粳一市石售人民币五千四百元左右，而民用土布，白布每尺售价人民币四百元，蓝黑布为五百五十元。成人一套衣服得用土布二丈六或二丈八。因此农民须卖出二石五六斗粮食，始能换回一身粗布衣料。盐价是六斤粮食折一斤。
    农民轻易不种棉花，除非今冬自家要添置棉被棉衣，才于春季种棉若干；又不讲究耕作，用种五谷的方法去培植棉花，故产量极低。今后要解决布匹的困难，只有采取陕甘宁边区以往的经验：提倡与奖励植棉，兴办家庭或村乡的纺织合作事业。同时组织物资交流，将瑞金产米畅销外省，换回食盐、布匹、洋货。这样一则解决了农民穿的问题，二则使农户有了副业收入；三则不致因谷贱而伤农。这样，瑞金将如速地踏上和平、幸福繁荣富庶的大道！
