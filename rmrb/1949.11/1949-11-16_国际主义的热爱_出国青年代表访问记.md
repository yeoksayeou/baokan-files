　　The Passion of Internationalism
    ——A Visit with Youth Representatives Returning from Abroad
    Jin Feng
    Representing the victorious new China's young generation, He Jingzhi, the author of "The White-Haired Girl" and young playwright, along with young combat heroes Zhang Yingcai, Liu Kuiji, and other representatives, attended the International Youth Festival and the Second World Democratic Youth Congress held in Budapest this August. With evident excitement, He Jingzhi described in fragments those "days composed of flowers, music, poetry, and song."
    　　　　(I) We Saw a Miniature of the World's Youth United
    "Budapest became a city of flags and flowers." Facing the clear blue sky of Beijing in early winter, He Jingzhi recalled the flower-filled Budapest of August. At that time, over ten thousand youth representatives from more than eighty countries—those whose homelands were under construction, those whose homelands were struggling—each held high the sacred flag of their country, singing as they advanced in Budapest. Our Chinese delegation advanced under dozens of large red flags and embroidered portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu. When we entered the venue, He Jingzhi recalled, the youth from all over the world and the Hungarian people cheered for us, throwing flowers towards us. On that day, when we saw the white and black representatives in the American delegation entering hand in hand, we saw a miniature of the world's youth united. We also saw the fighting youth representatives from free Greece, all wearing green military uniforms, which reminded us of our arduous combat life; many, even most, of our delegation members had worn military uniforms and fought on the front lines and in the rear. And in that ocean of flags of 300,000 people, what particularly moved the Chinese representatives was that the youth of various countries, in addition to holding high the portraits of their own revolutionary leaders and the world's revolutionary teacher Stalin, also held high the portrait of Mao Zedong. This made the representatives realize that our beloved Comrade Mao Zedong is not only a revolutionary leader supported by the Chinese people but also by the people of the world. At that time, the Soviet delegation, composed of more than 600 representatives, with the youth from the Stalin Automobile Factory walking in front, wearing pure white shirts and trousers and flowered skirts, holding large red flags and flowers, lightly entered the venue, like a cluster of soft, colorful clouds moving along, all eyes admiringly watching them. At this time, someone in our delegation exclaimed, look at them, they truly represent the brightness and happiness of the younger generation.
    When airplanes scattered flowers and more than a thousand peace doves flew up in the venue, and after General Xiao Hua, the head of the Chinese delegation, gave a speech, tens of thousands of people in the audience shouted "Mao—Ze—Dong" in unison, He Jingzhi said, at this moment, I wished the people of China could all see this scene with their own eyes. On the day of the carnival, the ships carrying the youth representatives of various countries gently swayed in the Danube River, and we heard the youth of various countries singing "Song to Stalin" and "March of the Motherland" together in different languages, and we heard American youth singing "March of the Volunteers". Everyone was thinking, this is the legendary world, where the youth of the world can be together like this, regardless of nationality, race, skin color, or religion, using poetry and song, flowers and music to weave their young lives! And right now, right here in Budapest, the youth of various countries are gathered together like brothers in a family, respecting each other, learning from each other, and linked by a common ideal for the future.
    　　　　(II) "Mao—Ze—Dong"!
    As soon as they entered Hungarian territory, the Chinese representatives found it hard to calm down; at every station, there were many people to welcome them, shouting "Mao—Ze—Dong." These three words "Mao Zedong" had become such a magical language, containing all kinds of countless meanings. It could represent "Long live the leader of the Chinese people, Mao Zedong," it could represent "Long live the Chinese people," "Greetings to friends from victorious China," and even include "Hello," "Welcome to our dear Chinese friends." An old lady rushed to bring a child forward, and both she, with her missing teeth, and the child made unclear sounds: "Mao—Ze—Dong." This scene was truly touching. Many Hungarian people also crowded around to give local wine jugs, grapes, apples, and bread to the Chinese representatives. As the train was about to leave, an old man stuffed an apple into the hands of a female representative, saying "Mao Zedong." Clearly, the only Chinese word that most Hungarian people knew was "Mao Zedong." Here, the explanation of "Mao Zedong" seemed to become "Goodbye, greetings to Comrade Mao Zedong." And when our female representative hurriedly gave the old man a Mao Zedong badge she was carrying, he was so happy that tears came to his eyes.
    　　　　(III) Hungarian Poets Sing the Praises of New China
    At the World Youth Congress, He Jingzhi and another young writer—the author of "Chiye River," Ruan Zhangjing—met with the Hungarian young poet Peter Kuczka. Twenty-four-year-old Peter Kuczka, who came from a working-class background, is now one of the most prestigious young poets in Hungary and a representative of the new type of intellectuals in the new democratic countries. When the Chinese young writers met with the Hungarian young poet, they talked about the literary situation in their respective countries and recited their own works. Although there was a language barrier, the writers and poets quickly understood the meaning of the works from the other country through the reciters' expressions and tones. They believed that these were all the voices of the people. Peter Kuczka once wrote a poem called "China," praising the newborn China. The main idea of the poem is: In the past, we were interested in China for its magical stories, but now we are concerned about the Chinese People's Liberation Army and Comrade Mao Zedong every day; opening the map, we pay attention to finding the footprints of the Liberation Army's advance; watching the progress of the Chinese Liberation Army is like surging waves, and if American imperialism wants to block it, isn't it like using a wooden stick to resist the waves of the sea? The Chinese youth representatives presented the congress with a vase made of an American-made shell, as a gift of the victory of the Chinese youth's struggle to the democratic youth of the world. This scene was so moving to the Hungarian young poet that he said he must write another poem to praise the heroic Chinese youth.
    　　　　(IV) Combat Heroes Respected Everywhere
    Zhang Yingcai is the famous battalion commander of the Zhang Yingcai Battalion of the Second Field Army of the People's Liberation Army, and Liu Kuiji is the company commander of the ever-victorious company and a combat hero of the Third Field Army. At the end of last year, they participated side by side in the Huaihai Campaign, the largest campaign in the Liberation War since its beginning. This year, when they walked on the streets of Budapest in PLA uniforms, groups of young men and women from all over the world and Hungarian people crowded around, wanting to see what the Chinese People's Liberation Army, which often annihilates hundreds of thousands of enemies in a single battle, looked like. No matter how shy Zhang Yingcai and Liu Kuiji were, people rushed to lift them high and gently put them down. People everywhere pulled them to take photos, asked them to sign autographs. At gatherings, when it was introduced that these were representatives of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the cheers and applause often lasted for several minutes.
    When they visited various places, there was military music and flowers along the way. Men and women, old and young, crowded on the roadside to shake hands, hug, pat them on the shoulders, and even touching their sleeves was good. The Hungarian people were so concerned about the Chinese Liberation War. When they visited a factory in a district of a small city, the district party secretary first introduced the progress of the Chinese Liberation War before introducing them, understanding it so well and clearly that it surprised our combat heroes. The workers also enthusiastically told them that when the news of the liberation of Shanghai and Nanjing came, Hungarian workers automatically held meetings to celebrate. One worker saw that Liu Kuiji, who was speaking, did not have a pen on his chest, and immediately took off the pen on his own body and gave it to Liu Kuiji. As he said this, Liu Kuiji's eyes shone with unconcealed joy, and he treasured the precious gift. When the reporter saw this Hungarian worker's pen worn on the chest of the Chinese combat hero, like these representatives going abroad, the reporter was also deeply moved by such concrete and vivid internationalist spirit.

　　国际主义的热爱
    ——出国青年代表访问记
    金凤
    代表着胜利了的新中国的青年一代，“白毛女”的执笔者，青年剧作者贺敬之和青年战斗英雄张英才、刘奎基和其他的代表们一起出席了今年八月在布达佩斯举行的国际青年节和世界民主青年第二次代表大会。带着显然的激动和兴奋，贺敬之断片地描绘着那一段“鲜花、音乐、诗和歌唱组成的日子。”
    　　　　（一）我们看到了全世界青年团结起来的缩影
    “布达佩斯成为旗帜与鲜花的城市”。贺敬之面对着初冬的北京的晴蓝的天空，回忆着那八月的花团锦簇的布达佩斯。那时，八十多个国家的青年代表一万余人——为祖国正在建设中的，为祖国正在斗争中的，各各擎了他们祖国神圣的国旗，在布达佩斯高歌前进。我们中国代表团，则是在几十面大红旗和毛主席、朱总司令的绣像下前进的。当我们走进会场时，贺敬之回忆着说，全场的青年和匈牙利人民向我们欢呼，把鲜花抛掷向我们。就在那一天，当我们看到了美国代表团中白人和黑人代表手挽手地进场时，我们看到了全世界青年团结起来的缩影。我们又看到了自由希腊的战斗青年代表，一律穿着绿色的军装，这使我们想起了我们的艰苦的战斗生活，我们代表团中许多人甚至可以说是一大半人都是穿过军装，在前方和后方作战过来的。而在这三十万人的旗帜的海洋中，特别使中国的代表看了感动的是，各国的青年，除了高举着他们本国的革命领袖和世界革命导师斯大林的画像外，还高举着毛泽东的画像。这使代表们知道，我们亲爱的毛泽东同志，不但是中国人民也是世界人民拥护的革命领袖之一。在那时，由六百多名代表组成的苏联代表团，在前面走着的斯大林汽车工厂的青年们穿着纯白色的衫裤和花边的衣裙，抱着大红旗和鲜花轻快地走进会场，仿佛是一簇轻柔的彩云在移动，全场的眼光欣羡地望着他们。这时我们代表中有人发出赞叹，看他们正是代表着年青一代的光明与幸福。
    当飞机撒下鲜花，一千多只和平之鸽在会场飞起，中国代表团长萧华将军演讲后，全场数十万人齐呼毛泽东时，贺敬之说，这时恨不得中国的人民都亲眼看到这情景。举行狂欢日那一天，各国青年代表们乘坐着的游船轻荡在多瑙河里，听到各国青年以不同的语言一起唱着“斯大林颂”，唱着“祖国进行曲”，听到美国青年唱“义勇军进行曲”，大家都在想，这是传说中的世界，世界上的青年们，可以这样不分国籍、种族、皮肤、宗教信仰，大家在一起，用诗和歌唱，鲜花和音乐来穿织他们年轻的生命！而就在现在，就在布达佩斯，各国的青年们是这样象一个家庭的兄弟般团聚在一起，互相尊敬，互相学习，被前途的共同理想连系着。
    　　　　（二）“毛——泽——东”！
    一进匈牙利国境，中国代表们的心境就难以平静，每一个车站上都有很多人来欢迎，欢呼着“毛—泽—东”。这“毛泽东”三个字已成为这样奇妙的语言，可以包含着各种各样数不清的意思，它可以代表“中国人民领袖毛泽东万岁”，可以代表“中国人民万岁”，“向胜利中国来的朋友们致敬”，甚至包含着“您好”，“欢迎你们来了，我的亲爱的中国朋友”。一位老太太抢着把小孩送上来，缺着牙齿的她和小孩都发出模糊不清的声音：“毛—泽—东”，这情境委实是令人感动的。许多匈牙利的人民又拥上来将土产的酒壶、葡萄、苹果和面包送给中国的代表，在火车快开时，又一位老头子把苹果塞给一位女代表，嘴里说着“毛泽东”，显然，大部分匈牙利人民所知道的唯一的中国字就是“毛泽东”，在这里“毛泽东”的解释似乎又成了“再见，向毛泽东同志致敬”。而当我们的女代表慌慌忙忙把带着的毛泽东章送给这位老人时，他欢喜得眼泪都流出来了。
    　　　　（三）匈牙利诗人歌颂着新中国
    在世界青年代表大会上，贺敬之和另一个青年作家——“赤页河”的作者阮章竞和匈牙利的青年诗人彼得·库兹卡会见了。二十四岁的工人出身的彼得·库兹卡是现在匈牙利青年诗人中最有声望的一个，也是新民主国家中新型知识分子的代表。当中国的青年作家和匈牙利的青年诗人在一起会面时，他们彼此交谈了两国的文艺情况，朗诵了各人的作品。虽然语言不通，但从朗诵者的表情及声调上，作家和诗人们很快懂得了另一个国度的作品的意义，他们认为这都是人民的声音。彼得·库兹卡曾经写过一首名叫“中国”的诗，歌颂新生的中国，那诗的大意是说：我们过去对中国感觉兴趣的是神奇的故事，但现在我们每天关心的是中国人民解放军和毛泽东同志；翻开地图，我们留意着找寻解放军进军的足迹；看中国解放军的进程好象汹涌的波涛，美国帝国主义要来挡住，岂非好象用木棒来抵挡大海的波涛？中国青年代表在世界代表大会开会时献给大会以美制炮弹做的花瓶，作为中国青年战斗的胜利果实赠给全世界的民主青年，这情景是这样的使这位匈牙利的青年诗人感动，他说他一定要另写一首诗来称颂中国的英勇的青年们。
    　　　　（四）战斗英雄到处受人尊敬
    张英才是人民解放军第二野战军有名的张英才营的营长，刘奎基是第三野战军常胜连的连长和战斗英雄。去年年底，他们曾并肩参加了解放战争进行以来规模最大的淮海战役。今年，当他们穿着解放军的服装，在布达佩斯的街上走着时，一队队的世界各国的男女青年和匈牙利人民拥上来，拥上来要看看经常一仗就歼灭敌人几十万的中国人民解放军是什么模样。不管张英才和刘奎基是多么怕羞，人们抢着将他们高高举起，轻轻放下。人们到处拉着给他们照相，请他们签字，在集会上，当介绍到这是中国人民解放军的代表时，欢呼和鼓掌声常常要延续到好几分钟。
    在他们到各处参观的时候，一路上是军乐和鲜花，男女老少，拥挤在路旁抢着跟他们握手、拥抱，拍他们的肩膀，甚至摸一下他们的衣袖也是好的。匈牙利人民是这样的关心着中国的解放战争，当他们参观一个小城中一个区的工厂时，区委书记在介绍他们以前，先介绍了中国解放战争进行的情况，了解得那样的熟悉和清楚，简直使我们的战斗英雄们吃惊。工人们又热情地告诉他们，当上海、南京解放的消息传来的时候，匈牙利工人们就自动开会庆祝起来。一个工人看到在演说的刘奎基胸前没有带着钢笔，立刻取下他自己身上的钢笔送给刘奎基。这样说着时，刘奎基眼中闪耀着掩藏不住的喜悦的光辉，珍重地拿出了那件宝贵的礼物。当记者看到这一枝匈牙利工人的钢笔，佩带在中国的战斗英雄的胸前时，和这些出国的代表一样，记者也为这样具体生动的国际主义精神深深感动了。
