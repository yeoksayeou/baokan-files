　　Consolidating the Revolutionary Order of the People's Capital
  　Beijing Public Security Bureau Strengthens Winter Defense Measures
    Robbery Cases Decrease and Solved Cases Increase in the Past Three Months
    [Beijing News] To implement the resolution of the Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference to further strengthen the public security of Beijing, the Beijing Public Security Bureau has achieved considerable success in the past three months with the assistance of the general public and the efforts of the bureau's police, consolidating the revolutionary order of the people's capital. Since August, robbery cases in Beijing have gradually decreased, while the number of solved cases has greatly increased. According to statistics, twenty-six robbery cases occurred in October, of which nineteen were solved, a decrease of 59% compared to the average number of cases that occurred from February to September after liberation, and a 29% increase in solved cases. The reasons for the gradual improvement of Beijing's public security work should first be attributed to the close cooperation between the general public and the public security organs. Many citizens have been able to assist the public security organs in capturing bandits in a timely manner. For example, on the evening of October 18th, vendor Bai Baozhong saw traffic police officer Fan Sen and others chasing a robber in the Yazi Kou area outside Qianmen. He dropped his stall and immediately gave chase, finally catching the bandit near the East Railway Station. Some sub-bureaus, on the principle of not hindering production, organized the masses through the police stations to establish public security groups, which also strengthened Beijing's public security work. In this situation, the 14th Police Station of the Inner Sixth Sub-bureau organized 325 citizens, divided into 28 groups. Each night, one group assisted the police station in its work. They not only played a considerable role in preventing bandits and thieves, patrolling, and guarding, but also closely connected the citizens and the police station. The general public responded well. Zhang Huchen, a sweet potato vendor, said, "It's easier to handle winter defense work when everyone is organized." At the same time, the police officers of the sub-bureaus and the criminal police brigade under the bureau, through continuous learning, have mostly begun to establish a work attitude of serving the people, and have taken a step forward in the work of preventing and capturing bandits. In order to ensure the smooth progress of the People's Political Consultative Conference, the sub-bureaus not only closely monitored the activities of bandits, but also, after the arrest of Wang FenGang's brother Wang Fengwu, the special agent leader, further arrested 185 people including Gao Jiadi, the remnant bandit of Wang Fenggang and the former Deputy Commander of the 9th District Security of the puppet Hebei Province, who were hiding in Beijing and conspiring to organize armed robbery. This was a serious blow to the bandits who attempted to cause trouble and endanger the lives and property of the people. The police stations also carried out focused patrols at night according to the different conditions of the areas under their jurisdiction. The traffic police officers on duty at important streets and lanes were also able to capture bandits in a timely and proactive manner. In addition, the relevant units of the People's Government have made planned arrangements for the poor and beggars who are living in hardship, which has also been of great help to the public security of Beijing. Therefore, in October, no robbery cases occurred in the jurisdictions of eleven of the city's twenty public security sub-bureaus, including Inner One, Inner Three, Inner Five, Inner Seven, Outer One, Outer Two, Outer Three, Outer Four, Northern Suburbs, Mentougou, and Changxindian. According to Luo Ruiqing, the concurrent director of the bureau, in order to strengthen Beijing's winter defense work, various necessary measures are being planned to consolidate the revolutionary order of the people's capital and further ensure the smooth development of production.

　　巩固人民首都革命秩序
  　京公安局加强冬防措施
    三个月来抢案减少破获增多
    【北京讯】北京市公安局为执行各界代表会议进一步加强京市治安的决议，三个月来在广大市民协助和该局员警的努力下，获得了相当大的成绩，巩固了人民首都的革命秩序。自八月份起，京市所发生的抢劫案件已在逐渐减少，而破获的案件则大大的增加。据统计，十月份所发生的抢劫案件计二十六起，破获了十九起，较解放后二月至九月所发生案件的总平均数减少了百分之五十九，破获案件提高了百分之二十九。京市治安工作逐渐提高的原因，首先应归功于广大人民与治安机关密切的配合，许多市民均能及时协助治安机关捕捉盗匪。摊贩白宝忠于十月十八日晚，在前门外鸭子嘴地方看见交通警范森等在追捕一个抢匪，他扔下摊子立即追去，卒在东车站附近将匪徒抓住，即其中一例。有些分局在不妨碍生产的原则下，由各派出所组织群众，建立治安小组，也加强了京市的治安工作。内六分局第十四派出所就在这种情况下组织了市民三百二十五人，分为二十八组，每夜由一个组协助派出所工作，在防匪、防盗、巡逻、守望等工作上不但都起了相当的作用，并密切的将市民和派出所连结起来。一般市民反映良好，卖白薯的小贩张虎臣说：“大家组织起来，冬防工作也好办了。”同时，该局所属各分局和刑警大队的员警，在不断的学习中，大多数都开始树立了为人民服务的工作态度，在防匪与捕匪工作上提高了一步。该局为保卫人民政协顺利进行，各分局不但严密监视匪徒活动，并于特务头子王凤岗之弟王凤武就捕后，进一步于九月九日开始，有计划的逮捕了匿迹京市、阴谋组织武装抢劫的王凤岗残匪伪河北省第九区保安副司令高甲第等一百八十五名，对于企图蠢动，危害人民生命财产安全的匪徒们，给了严重的打击。各派出所并根据所辖地区之不同情况，于夜间作有重点之巡逻，冲要街巷的交通警于值勤时，亦能及时主动的捕捉匪徒。另外，人民政府各有关单位，对于生活困苦的贫民、乞丐等作了有计划的安置，对于京市治安上亦有很大的帮助。因此，在十月份中，全市二十个公安分局中，内一、内三、内五、内七、外一、外二、外三、外四、北郊、门头沟、长辛店等十一个分局辖区内没有发生过抢案。据该局罗瑞卿兼局长表示：为加强京市冬防工作，现正计划各项必要措施，以巩固人民首都的革命秩序，进而保障生产得以顺利的发展。
