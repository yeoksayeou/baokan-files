It is reported that Ahmatjan and his party died in an air crash en route from Yining to Beijing in September of this year. The obituary reads: “Obituary from the Central Organizing Committee of the Xinjiang Peace and Democracy League: Comrade Ahmatjan, Chairman of the Central Committee of the New League, Vice Chairman of the Provincial Government, Comrade Ishaq Beg, Member of the Central Organizing Committee of the New League, Member of the Provincial Government, Commander of the Provincial Security, and Lieutenant General Commander of the National Army, Comrade Abdulkerim, Member of the Central Committee of the New League, Director of the Information Department of the New League, Member of the Provincial Government, and Deputy Secretary-General of the Provincial Government, Comrade Dalelkhan, Member of the Central Committee of the New League, Member of the Provincial Government, Deputy Director of the Economic Committee of the Three Districts, Commissioner of the Altay District, and Major General Deputy Commander of the National Army, a national hero, Comrade Luo Zhi, President of the Xinjiang Branch of the Sino-Soviet Cultural Association, and his entourage, Major Officer Hei Nikliemov, New League Intelligence Office reporter Abdulreshit Iminov, and Wosman Benaslov, as well as the pilots, unfortunately encountered a plane crash due to severe weather conditions en route from Yining to Beijing and died heroically. The Central Committee of the Xinjiang Peace and Democracy League expresses its deep condolences to all members of the League and the people of the province. Due to their unfortunate deaths, our people have forever parted with the glorious warriors who devoted their lives to the cause of liberation of Xinjiang Province from colonial and imperialist enslavement. The sacrifice of Comrade Ahmatjan, Lieutenant General Ishaq Beg, Comrade Abdulkerim Abbasov, Major General Dalelkhan, and Comrade Luo Zhi—the most loyal sons who spent their entire lives on the cause of people’s liberation—is a great loss to the people of Xinjiang and the democratic liberation fighters of the new province. Their spirit of sacrifice on the New League front and their unlimited loyalty to the national liberation movement have won the enthusiastic love of the people throughout the province. The spirit of struggle and contributions to the cause of democracy and peace made by Comrades Ahmatjan, Ishaq Beg, Abdulkerim Abbasov, Dalelkhan, and Luo Zhi are eternal inspirations and models for all warriors who are fighting to transform Xinjiang into an advanced region of the new democratic China.
