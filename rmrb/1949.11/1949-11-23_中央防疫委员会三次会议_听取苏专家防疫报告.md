Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 22nd: The Central Anti-Epidemic Committee held its third meeting today to hear reports from Soviet medical experts on the prevention and control of the recent plague in Chahar Province, and from the leader of the Soviet Anti-Epidemic Team, who previously served in Northeast China, on the situation regarding the eradication of the plague in Northeast China this year. Those present included Dong Biwu, Chairman of the Anti-Epidemic Committee, Vice-Chairmen Li Dequan and He Cheng, and committee members Lu Dingyi, Yang Qiqing, and Huang Shaohong, among others. Also present were the heads of anti-epidemic work from Northeast China, North China, Chahar, and Beijing, as well as Soviet experts Raksin, Shakhturdovsky, Beloselzeva, Moshinkova, and the leader of the Soviet Anti-Epidemic Team, Maisky, among others.

　　The meeting was presided over by Dong Biwu. First, Professor Raksin of Moscow University, a Stalin Prize laureate, reported on the situation of his work in Chahar Province for the prevention and control of the plague. Dr. Raksin first reported on the confirmation of the diagnosis of this plague, the source of the plague's transmission, the clinical symptoms and course of the plague, and the epidemic situation. Dr. Raksin said: A total of 70 patients were identified. Sixty-eight had died before the arrival of the anti-epidemic team. The two patients treated by the anti-epidemic team both recovered. Dr. Raksin said that, due to the comprehensive anti-epidemic work and the seasonal factors, the plague stopped developing, allowing them to complete the task given to them by the Central Anti-Epidemic Committee on schedule, which was to stop the spread of the plague within half a month.

　　Dr. Raksin then reported on the measures taken for the prevention and control of the plague and their effectiveness. Regarding the blockade of transportation, he said that they had personally seen that the blockade of both the epidemic area and the quarantine area was strictly enforced. Regarding the mass anti-epidemic movement, he said that the work of the village health committees in the epidemic area had achieved great success, and this experience should be applied to the prevention of other epidemics in the future. Regarding disinfection, he said that drug disinfection was the most effective method. He said that they had opposed the Japanese method of burning houses for disinfection because it was detrimental to the interests of the people and often only destroyed the roofs and doors and windows, while the indoor clothing was often intact, and the rats could escape from the fire to other places.

　　Regarding future plague prevention and control work, Dr. Raksin proposed three measures: First, universal preventive vaccinations should be carried out within a 30-kilometer radius around the epidemic area; second, all death registrations should be carried out in the epidemic area to detect patients as early as possible and isolate and treat them as early as possible; third, the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government should uniformly lead all anti-epidemic teams so that they can be mobilized in a timely manner. He said that with these methods, the epidemic can be quickly eradicated in ten to fifteen days. As for whether the source of the current plague epidemic's central area can be completely eliminated, it depends on the large-scale reclamation of grasslands and wastelands, or the use of various methods such as drugs and machinery to eliminate wild rodents. Finally, Dr. Raksin said that the People's Republic of China has all the conditions necessary to prevent the spread of the plague.

　　After Dr. Raksin's report, Maisky, the leader of the Soviet Anti-Epidemic Work Team who previously served in Northeast China, reported on the team's experience in eradicating the plague in Northeast China this year, as well as his opinions on carrying out this work in the future.

　　After Maisky's report, He Cheng put forward some suggestions for future work based on Dr. Raksin's report. Finally, Dong Biwu, on behalf of the Chinese people and the Central People's Government, repeatedly expressed sincere gratitude to the Soviet experts and all members of the anti-epidemic team.

　　中央防疫委员会三次会议
　　听取苏专家防疫报告
    【新华社北京二十二日电】中央防疫委员会今日举行第三次会议，听取苏联医学专家报告此次防治察北鼠疫和原在东北服务的苏联防疫队队长报告今年扑灭东北鼠疫的情况。出席的有防疫委员会主任委员董必武，副主任委员李德全、贺诚和委员陆定一、杨奇清、黄绍竑等。列席的有东北、华北、察哈尔、北京等地防疫工作的负责人，还有苏联专家拉克森、沙克多夫斯基、白洛塞杰娃、莫辛柯娃、和苏联防疫队队长马意斯基等。
    会议由董必武主持，首由莫斯科大学教授、斯大林奖金获得者拉克森博士报告这次去察北进行防治鼠疫工作的情形。拉克森博士首先就此次鼠疫诊断的确定、鼠疫传染来源、鼠疫的临床症状及病程、鼠疫流行情况作了报告。拉克森博士说：此次总计患者七十人，在防疫队到达之前已死去六十八人，经防疫队治疗的两人则均得痊愈。拉克森博士说：由于全面防疫工作的开展和季节的关系，鼠疫停止了发展，使我们按期完成了中央防疫委员会给我们的任务，就是在半个月内制止了鼠疫的蔓延。
    拉克森博士接着逐一报告各项防治鼠疫工作的措施及其效果。关于封锁交通，他说他们亲眼看到，无论疫区或检疫区的封锁，都执行得很严格。关于群众性的防疫运动，他说这次疫区各村卫生委员会的工作有很大成绩，这种经验今后应该运用到其他流行病的预防中去。关于消毒，他说药品消毒是最有效的办法，他说他们此次曾反对袭用日本人焚烧房屋的消毒方法，因为那样既有损于人民的利益，而且往往只能烧毁屋顶和门窗，室内衣物往往完好如故，同时老鼠却可以从火中逃亡他处。
    关于今后防治鼠疫的工作，拉克森博士提出了三项办法：第一、疫区周围三十公里直径以内，应进行普遍的预防注射；第二、在疫区进行一切的死亡登记，以便及早发现病人和及早予以隔离治疗；第三、中央人民政府卫生部要统一领导所有防疫队，以便能及时调动。他说用这些办法可以在十天至十五天内迅速扑灭疫情。至于此次鼠疫流行的中心区域之病源是否可以完全消灭，则在于将草地及荒地大量开垦，或用各种方法如药物及机械等消灭野鼠。最后，拉克森博士说：中华人民共和国已具备了一切条件，一定能防止鼠疫的蔓延。
    拉克森博士报告毕，由原在东北服务的苏联防疫工作队队长马意斯基报告该队今年在东北扑灭鼠疫的经过，以及对今后进行这个工作的意见。
    马意斯基报告毕，贺诚根据拉克森博士的报告，提出今后工作的若干意见。最后董必武代表中国人民和中央人民政府向苏联专家和防疫队全体人员再三表示诚恳的感谢。
