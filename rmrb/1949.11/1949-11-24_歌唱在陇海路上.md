　　Singing on the Longhai Road
　　Wu Dazhong
    "Lai ai cough! Le ai!
    Everyone come and work! Ai cough yo!
    Repair the Longhai Road! Ai cough yo!
    Liberate the Great Northwest! Ai cough yo!"
    This is the call heard everywhere on the Longhai Road! This is the labor song of the working people! It is also the construction slogan of the people's construction vanguard. On the lines it is sung like this, on the bridges it is also sung like this. For three months, in the mountains and fields of western Henan, throughout the entire Longhai Road, this song has been echoing and surging all day long. This song has awakened the labor enthusiasm of many people, and this song has also unified the work pace of many people. In this singing, bridges are built, lines are laid flat, and the people's locomotives, along the direction indicated by Mao Zedong, are advancing bravely on the motherland's fields.
    The work chant, this labor song of the working people, represents the labor emotions of the people's armed technical forces, and also represents the will of the people's railway construction troops.
    When they—the railway corps detachment—repaired the Beining Railway, built the Luanhe Railway Bridge, and marched straight into the Central Plains, they sang in unison:
    "People's Railway Corps! Ai cough yo!
    From the Northeast to the South of the Yangtze! Ai cough yo!
    Repair all the railways in the country! Ai cough yo!
    This time we enter the Central Plains! Ai cough yo wa!
    Pave the Longhai Road! Ai cough yo!
    Save the people of the Northwest from disaster! Ai cough yo wa!"
    When they began to rush repairs in Jingu Garden, braving the intense heat of the Central Plains, the scorching sun burned their hands and faces, and they sang in unison:
    "Ai cough yo wa! Ai cough yo!
    Fire the first shot! Repair to Xin'an Station!
    It doesn't matter if it's hot! Determination must be realized!
    Yo wa cough! Ai cough yo wa cough!
    See who is the hero! See who is the good fellow!"
    The people's train drove into Xin'an Station, and the people welcomed it with drums, music, and firecrackers. Bright red congratulatory banners, tables full of cigarettes, and entire loads of watermelons were sent to express condolences. The villagers, looking at the steel team advancing slowly along the line, praised and complimented them, and everyone began to sing:
    "Lai cough yo wa! Lai cough yo!
    Railway technical soldiers! Repairing roads is their responsibility!
    The people come to express condolences! We must not forget it!
    We must abide by the Three Main Rules of Discipline! We must remember the Eight Points for Attention!
    Army and people are of one heart! Repair the Longhai Road!
    Support the Great Northwest! Eliminate Chiang Kai-shek!"
    The rush repair of the Xin'an-Mianchi section began. Under the difficult conditions of high roadbeds, deep cuts, large curves, hot weather, and heavy rain, they advanced at an average speed of two or three kilometers per day, and everyone sang with a hundredfold spirit:
    "Ai cough yo wa! Ai cough yo!
    There are many difficulties in road construction! Can't stop the Communist Party!
    Work harder! Victory belongs to us!"
    After repairing Mianchi, they encountered the continuous autumn rain in the Central Plains. The soldiers braved the bad weather, wearing clothes that looked like they had been washed in water all day long on the long lines, and still fought and sang:
    "Ai cough yo wa! Ai cough yo!
    Sweat in sunny days! Get wet in rainy days!
    Regardless of wind and rain! We'll do the same!"
    The news of the founding of New China spread to the Longhai Road, jumping and singing:
    "New China is founded! The people have turned over!
    The reactionaries are overthrown! We are the masters!
    Straighten up our backs! Swing the big sledgehammer!
    Add oil and work together! Build a new China!"
    Victorious news of the liberation of the Northwest provinces and the liberation of Guangzhou spread to the Longhai Road like snowflakes. The people's locomotives also crossed Zhang Maozhen and advanced westward. The soldiers, looking at their glorious achievements and listening to the victorious news from the front, cheered and sang.
    "The front is winning battles! Road construction is keeping up!
    Fight faster at the front! We will repair faster!
    Make one last effort! Capture Chiang Kai-shek alive!"
    The Longhai Railway was soon fully opened to traffic in this singing. The soldiers of the Railway Corps will sing this construction song of the working people even higher, further, and louder, singing in the direction indicated by Mao Zedong, singing on the land of the Northwest, and singing on the fields of the motherland.

　　歌唱在陇海路上
　　吴大中
    “来唉咳！了唉！
    大家都来干哪！唉咳哟！
    修通陇海路哇！唉咳哟！
    解放大西北呀！唉咳哟！”
    这是陇海路上到处可以听见的喊号声！这是劳动人民的劳动歌声！也是人民建设先锋部队的建设口号。线路上这样歌唱着，桥梁上也是这样歌唱着，三个月来，豫西山野里，整个陆海路上，这歌声整日洋溢着，激荡着了。这歌声唤起多少人们的劳动热情，这歌声也齐一了多少人们的工作步调，就在这歌唱声中，桥梁架好了，线路铺平了，人民的火车头，沿着毛泽东指示的方向，在祖国的原野上英勇的前进着。
    喊号子，这劳动人民的歌声，它代表了人民武装技术部队的劳动情感，也代表了人民铁道建设部队的意志。
    当他们——铁道兵团支队，修通北宁铁路，架好滦河铁桥，长驱挺进中原的时候，他们就同声歌唱着：
    “人民铁道兵团哪！唉咳哟！
    从东北到江南哪！唉咳哟！
    全国铁路修个遍哪！唉咳哟！
    咱们这次进中原哪！唉咳哟哇！
    铺平那陇海路哇！唉咳哟！
    救西北人民出灾难哪！唉咳哟哇！”
    当他们冒着中原酷暑在金谷园开始抢修的时候，灼热的太阳晒痛了他们的手和脸，他们就同声歌唱着：
    “唉咳哟哇！唉咳哟！
    打响第一炮哇！修到新安站哪！
    天热不要紧哪！决心要实现哪！
    哟哇咳！唉咳哟哇咳！
    看谁是英雄啊！看谁是好汉啊！”
    人民火车开进了新安站，人民鼓乐喧天，鞭炮齐鸣的欢迎着，鲜红的贺旗，满桌的香烟，整挑的大西瓜，送过来慰问，老乡们眼望着沿着线路缓缓推进的钢铁队伍，齐声赞叹着，夸奖着，大家又开始歌唱：
    “来咳哟哇！来咳哟！
    铁道技术兵呀！修路有责任哪！
    人民来慰问哪！咱们不能忘哪！
    三大纪律要守住哇！八项注意要记牢哇！
    军民一条心哪！修好陇海路哇！
    支援大西北呀！消灭蒋介石呀！”
    新安渑池段抢修开始了，在高路基，深切土，曲线大，天气热，暴雨多的困难条件下，每日以二、三公里的平均速度前进着，大家又精神百倍慰快的歌唱起来：
    “唉咳哟哇！唉咳哟！
    修路困难多呀！挡不住共产党呀！
    多努一把力呀！胜利归咱们哪！”
    修过渑池，就遇到了中原地区的连绵秋雨，战士们冒着恶劣天气，在漫长的线路上，整天身穿着水洗般的衣服，照样地搏斗着、歌唱着：
    “唉咳哟哇！唉咳哟！
    晴天身流汗哪！雨天湿个遍哪！
    不管风和雨呀！咱们一样干哪！”
    新中国成立的消息，传到了陇海路上，跳跃着，歌唱着：
    “新中国成立了哇！人民大翻身哪！
    反动派被打倒哇！咱们作主人哪！
    拔起腰板来呀！抡起大铁锤呀！
    加油齐努力呀！建设新中国呀！”
    西北各省解放，广州解放的胜利消息，雪片般传到了陇海路上，人民的火车头也越过了张茅镇，长驱西进着，战士们眼望着自己的光荣成绩，耳听着前方的胜利消息，欢呼着，歌唱着。
    “前方打胜仗哪！修路赶得上哪！
    前方快点打呀！咱们快点修呀！
    最后努把力呀！活捉蒋介石呀！”
    陇海铁路就在这歌唱声中，很快就全面通车了，铁道兵团的战士们，将把这劳动人民的建设歌声，唱得更高，唱得更远，唱得更响亮，沿着毛泽东指示的方向，歌唱在西北的大地，歌唱在祖国的原野。
