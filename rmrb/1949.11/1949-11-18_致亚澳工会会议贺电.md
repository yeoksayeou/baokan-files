　　Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 17th: The Preparatory Committee of the Hubei General Trade Union, representing 1.5 million worker brothers in Hubei, sent a telegram of congratulations to the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference on the 16th. The text of the telegram is as follows:

　　To Comrade Louis Saillant, Secretary-General of the World Federation of Trade Unions, and to all comrades attending the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference:

　　We are delighted to hear of your arrival in Beijing. We, the 1.5 million worker brothers in Hubei, extend our heartfelt and warm welcome to you. Today, the Chinese people have defeated their internal and external enemies and established their own New China. The holding of such a grand international conference in Beijing, the people's capital, is not only a great honor for the Chinese working class, but also of particular importance to the struggle for lasting international peace and people's democracy by uniting the working classes of Asia and Australia.

　　For over a century, the working class brothers in Asia and Australia have suffered cruel oppression from imperialists and their running dogs. Therefore, we equally clearly recognize that only by uniting to overthrow the rule of imperialism can the working class and all working people achieve freedom and liberation. The Chinese working class and the people of the whole country have stood up under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, which has a tremendous impact on the working people of Asia and Australia. We believe that in the near future, the oppressed working people of Asia and Australia will certainly strengthen their unity, fundamentally overthrow the heinous rule of imperialists and their running dogs, and achieve complete liberation.

　　Today, the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference officially opens in Beijing, the capital of the Chinese people, especially with Comrade Louis Saillant, Secretary-General of the World Federation of Trade Unions, and the responsible comrades of the Executive Bureau directly presiding over it. We are deeply convinced that it will achieve brilliant success in uniting the working classes of Asia and Australia, exchanging experiences in struggle, and formulating various action plans for the Asian-Australian labor movement. Here, the 1.5 million working class in Hubei extend our congratulations to you and wish the conference a complete success.

    世界工会联合会总书记路易·赛扬同志并转出席亚澳工会会议的全体同志们：
    欣闻你们到达北京，我们全华中一百五十万工人阶级兄弟谨向你们致衷心的热烈的欢迎之忱。今天中国人民已经战胜了她的内外敌人，并建立了自己的新中国。如今在人民的首都北京来开这样一个隆重的国际盛会，这不仅是中国工人阶级的莫大荣誉，对于团结全亚、澳工人阶级争取国际持久和平与人民民主的斗争，都有特别重要的意义。
    亚澳两洲的工人阶级弟兄，百余年来同是受着帝国主义者及其走狗们残酷压迫。因此，我们同样清楚地认识到：只有团结起来推翻帝国主义的统治，工人阶级和全体劳动人民，才能得到自由解放。中国工人阶级和全国人民在毛主席的英明领导下已经站起来了，这对亚澳两洲劳动人民的影响是巨大的。我们相信在不久的将来，亚澳两洲被压迫的劳动人民一定能够加强团结，根本推翻帝国主义者及其走狗们的万恶统治而获得彻底解放。
    今天，亚洲、澳洲工会会议正式在中国人民的首都北京揭幕，特别是由世界工联总书记路易·赛扬同志和执行局各负责同志们来直接主持，在团结亚澳工人阶级、交换斗争经验、制订亚澳工人运动的各种行动计划，我们深信定必有辉煌的成就。我们华中一百五十万工人阶级谨在这里向你们致贺并预祝大会胜利。
