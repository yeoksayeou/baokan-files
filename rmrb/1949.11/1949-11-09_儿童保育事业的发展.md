In old China, most children were not valued. The children of the working masses often struggled on the brink of starvation, cold, disease, and death. Abortion, infanticide, and selling children were common phenomena in the old Chinese society. Many impoverished children wandered the streets without care. According to statistics, in 1946, the number of child deaths in Beijing was 16,634. In Shanghai, in November 1947 alone, the corpses of 1,300 abandoned children were found in one month. Under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, the children of the working people were an unfortunate group who suffered greatly.

In New China, especially in the old liberated areas, the broad masses of poor peasants were distributed land, and women also spun yarn, wove cloth, and participated in agricultural production. Everyone had enough to eat and wear, and their lives were improved. Chairman Mao once put forward the slogan "People Prosper, Wealth Flourishes," which meant that the people should not only be well-fed and clothed, but also be able to raise the children they bore. The People's Government explicitly prohibited infanticide and abortion, and "illegitimate children" were recognized as having legal status and were not allowed to be discriminated against or murdered. In areas where land reform had been completed, children also enjoyed land rights and other property rights. According to statistics from the North China Harrison Hospital, 100% of rural women seeking gynecological treatment wanted to have children. The People's Governments of various liberated areas have all established regulations to protect women's production and childcare, stipulating the leave for pregnant women before and after childbirth in various agencies, giving women a certain amount of production and childcare expenses, and encouraging the establishment of nurseries. The People's Government placed the homeless children in the cities in reformatories, giving them food, clothing, shelter, and the opportunity to receive education. After being reorganized after liberation, the Beijing Municipal Children's Welfare Institute improved its food, and the children were organized. The former beggars are now participating in literacy classes and autonomous associations and are beginning to embark on a healthy and happy path.

Under the call and assistance of the People's Government, women in various places are actively engaged in childcare. On the one hand, they are popularizing maternal and child hygiene, training and organizing midwives and medical teams to distribute them to various rural areas, transforming old midwives, publicizing the benefits of new-style midwifery, promoting public health, and rescuing sick children. In Shuiyang Village, Sixth District, Tang County, a woman named Zhang had five children who all died from umbilical cord infections. When she gave birth to her sixth child, a new midwife happened to be in their village to help her deliver the baby. Both the mother and the child were safe and sound, and they told everyone about the benefits of the new midwifery method.

Under the conditions of enemy blockade, raids, sabotage, and extreme difficulties in medicine, manpower, and materials, the liberated areas still paid attention to childcare. Schools, agencies, factories, and troops have successively established half-day or full-day childcare facilities, concentrating their efforts to protect children, giving children better food and clothing, paying attention to nutrition and hygiene, and implementing strict systems to prevent infectious diseases; at the same time, in times of emergency, many childcare workers still actively and bravely persisted in their work, fully displaying selfless maternal love for the children. For example, when infectious diseases were prevalent, childcare workers gave blood transfusions to children; when the enemy attacked, childcare workers carried children over mountains and rivers; when enemy planes strafed, they used their bodies to protect the children. When the enemy situation was tense, everyone took one or two children and dispersed to the homes of the peasants to hide. Two childcare workers in Jiaodong, when the enemy raided the village, picked up the children and hid in the woods. Regardless of the cold wind and heavy snow, they untied their cotton clothes and tightly wrapped the children in their arms for a day and a night. In the war environment and with backward transportation tools, the Shandong Provincial Nursery School, with more than 100 children, made seven arduous transfers from September 1946 to the autumn of 1948, experienced five strategic areas, and traveled more than 5,000 li under the overall arrangement and assistance of the CCP and the People's Government. The Los Angeles Nursery School, in a rural environment blockaded by the enemy for nine years, did not have a single child die of illness.

In the liberated major cities, they are actively restoring, improving, and opening factory nurseries. The women's work departments of trade unions and the welfare departments of women's federations are working together to go to various factories to help improve the work of nurseries. In Tianjin and Shanghai, in the two or three months after liberation, some factory nurseries expanded their rooms, added young nannies, purchased medical and health equipment, set up isolation rooms, mobilized nannies to feed the children boiled water, supplement infant food, wipe the children's sweat, bathe them, wash diapers, etc., to ensure the healthy development of the children, and gradually alleviate the actual difficulties of the female workers.

If factory nurseries are well-run, they can indeed reduce the burden on female workers with children and increase the quantity and quality of production. For example, a female worker in Shanghai Zhongfang No. 10 Factory, since liberation, because the work of the nursery has improved, she has been relieved about her child, and her output has increased from 27 real unit base salary rewards per week to 31 units. Xu Fengying of the Dalian Fishing Net Factory, who had two children, could only weave 30 knots of net per day. After sending the children to the nursery, she initially wove 80 knots, and later wove more than 100 knots. She was elected as a labor model. According to the statistics of the Fishing Net General Factory Nursery, since 95 mothers sent their children to the nursery, their work efficiency has increased by an average of 64%, not only completing their tasks but also increasing their personal income. Before the liberation of Beijing, there were three public nurseries and six private nurseries, accommodating 443 children. After liberation, by September, 20 new public nurseries and 12 private nurseries were added, accommodating 1,240 children, an increase of three and a half times compared with before liberation; the four cities of Beijing, Tianjin, Nanjing, and Shanghai originally had a total of 29 nurseries, and now they have increased to 81, with a total of 3,649 children accommodated.

In addition to actively promoting and supporting the establishment of nurseries by various agencies, the All-China Women's Federation Welfare Department will contact private nurseries and mass organizations for childcare that sincerely want to provide childcare services and have work performance, and encourage them to continue their efforts.

The guiding principles for childcare work in the future are: to encourage the establishment of day nurseries for female workers and employees in factories, agencies, and enterprises, and to establish full-time childcare institutions in places where conditions permit to take care of the orphans of martyrs, children whose parents are far away, or children whose mothers are working too hard; to train childcare talents, focusing on training in practical work, and to run childcare training classes or childcare schools in a planned way under possible conditions. We must start from solving practical problems and run small day nurseries to achieve universality.

### 儿童保育事业的发展

　　儿童保育事业的发展
    在旧中国大多数的儿童是不被重视的，广大劳动群众的孩子们，经常挣扎在饥寒病患的死亡线上。打胎溺婴和卖儿女在中国旧社会是很普遍的现象，许多贫苦儿童流浪在街头没有人照管。据统计一九四六年北京市儿童死亡数有一万六千六百三十四个。上海市在一九四七年十一月，一个月里被丢弃的小孩死尸就有一千三百个。在国民党反动派的统治下，劳动人民的儿童是不幸的一群，他们所受的苦难是很多的。
    在新中国特别是老解放区，广大贫苦农民分得了土地，妇女也纺线、织布参加农业生产，大家有吃有穿，生活得到了改善，毛主席曾经提出“人兴财旺”的口号，就是说人民不仅是要做到丰衣足食，而且要生了孩子都能养活。人民政府明令禁止溺婴堕胎，“私生子”被承认有合法的地位，不许歧视虐杀。在土地改革完成的地区，儿童也享有土地权和其它财产权。据华北哈里逊医院的统计，来治妇科病的农村妇女，百分之百是为了要生孩子。各解放区人民政府都订有保护妇女生产育儿的条例，规定了各机关孕妇产前产后的假期，给妇女一定数目的生产和育儿的费用等等，并且鼓励开办托儿所。在城市里的流浪儿童，人民政府把他们安置在教养机关里，给他们衣食住和受教育的机会。北京的市立育幼所，解放以后经过整顿，伙食改善了，儿童们被组织起来了，过去的乞儿今天参加了识字班、自治会，开始走上了健康愉快的道路。
    在人民政府的号召和协助下，各地妇女积极从事儿童保育事业。一面普及妇婴卫生，训练和组织接生员、医疗队，分布到各农村，改造旧接生婆，宣传新法接生的好处，提倡公共卫生，救治害病的孩子。唐县六区水羊村，有个姓张的媳妇，生了五个孩子都是害脐带风死的，当她生第六个孩子的时候，正好有新的接生员在他们村里帮她接生，产妇和孩子都很平安，他们夫妇俩看见人就宣传新法接生的好处。
    在敌人封锁，扫荡、破坏，和医药、人力、物力极端困难的条件下，解放区还是注意了保育事业。学校、机关、工厂和部队都先后成立了半托或者全托的儿童保育机关，集中力量保卫孩子，给儿童较好的衣食，注意营养和卫生，实行严格的预防传染病的制度；同时，在紧急的时期，许多保育员仍然积极英勇地坚持了工作，对孩子们充分发挥了大公无私的母爱。比如在传染病流行的时候，保育员为孩子们输血；在敌人进攻的时候，保育员背着孩子翻山涉水；当敌机扫射的时候，她们就以自己的身体去掩护孩子。在敌情紧张的时候，每个人带着一两个孩子分散到农民家里隐蔽起来。胶东有两个保育员，当敌人扫荡到村子里的时候，她们抱起孩子躲在树林里，不管寒风大雪，解开棉衣，把孩子紧紧地裹在怀里一天一夜。在战争的环境中，在落后的交通工具下，山东省托儿所带着一百多个孩子，从一九四六年九月到一九四八年秋天的两年中，在中共和人民政府的整个布置和帮助之下，曾经作了七次艰苦的转移，经历了五个战略区，一共走了五千多里路。洛杉机托儿所在被敌人封锁九年的乡村环境中，没有病死过一个小孩。
    在解放了的各大城市，正在积极恢复、改进和开办工厂托儿所，工会女工部和妇联福利部协力到各工厂，帮助改进托儿所的工作。在天津和上海，解放后的两三个月中间，有些工厂的托儿所扩充了房间，增加了年青的保姆，购置了医药卫生用具，设立了隔离室，发动保姆给孩子们喂开水，补充乳儿食品，给孩子们擦汗，洗澡，洗尿布等，保证孩子们的健康发育，逐渐解除了女工们的实际困难。
    工厂托儿所办好了，确实可以减轻有孩子的女工们的负担，提高生产品的数量和质量。象上海中纺十厂一个女工，自从解放以后，因为托儿所工作改善了，她对孩子放了心，生产量就从每星期二十七个折实单位底薪的报酬，增加到三十一个单位。大连鱼网工厂托儿所的徐凤英带着两个孩子，每天只能织三十扣网，把孩子送进托儿所以后，最初是织八十扣，后来一直织到一百多扣了，她当选了劳动模范。据鱼网总厂托儿所的统计，九十五位母亲自从把孩子送进托儿所以后，工作效率平均提高了百分之六十四，不但完成了任务，而且增加了个人的收入。北京解放以前，原有公立托儿所三处，私立托儿所六处，寄托儿童四百四十三人，解放以后到九月为止新增加的公立托儿所有二十处，私立托儿所十二处，寄托儿童一千二百四十人，比解放以前增加了三倍半；北京天津南京上海四个城市原来一共有托儿所二十九处，现在已经增加到八十一所，寄托儿童总数是三千六百四十九人。
    除了积极推动和扶助各机关成立托儿所以外，对于私营托儿所和儿童保育的群众团体，凡是诚心愿意为儿童保育服务，有工作表现的，全国妇联福利部就和他们联系，鼓励他们继续努力。
    今后的保育工作方针是：提倡在工厂机关和企业部门为女工和女职员成立日间托儿所，在有条件的地方，建立全托的保育机关，照顾烈士遗孤、父母远离或者母亲工作过于繁重的孩子；培养保育人才，着重在实际工作中的训练，在可能的条件下，有计划地办保育训练班或者保育学校。要从解决实际问题出发，举办小型的日间托儿所，以求普遍。
