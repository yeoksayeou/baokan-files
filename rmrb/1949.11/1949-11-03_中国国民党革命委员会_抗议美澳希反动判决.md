　　Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang
  　Protests Reactionary Judgments by the US, Australia, and Greece
    [Report from this newspaper] The Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang issued the following statement protesting the destruction of human rights by the governments of the United States, Australia, and Greece:
    The recent judgments by the US imperialist-controlled courts against the leaders of the American Communist Party and the lawyers defending them, the judgments by the Australian reactionary government, a running dog of US imperialism, against the leaders of the Australian Communist Party, and the judgments by the Greek reactionary government, a running dog of US imperialism, against the Greek revolutionary leaders, have completely exposed the hideous face of fascism and aroused public indignation in countries around the world.
    We are extremely disgusted with the actions of the reactionary governments of the US, Australia, and Greece in destroying the basic human rights of the people; we are extremely sympathetic to the leaders of the Communist Parties of the US and Australia, who are being barbarically persecuted for the sake of human peace and happiness, and to the Greek revolutionary leaders, who are being barbarically persecuted for the sake of the people's liberation.
    We are willing to stand with the people of all countries in upholding world democracy and peace, in striving for the liberation of the people, and in working hard to overthrow imperialism and fascism. At the same time, we hope that the people of all countries, especially the people of the United States, will strengthen their unity, resist the threat of fascism, and stop the conspiracies of the warmongers.

　　中国国民党革命委员会
  　抗议美澳希反动判决
    【本报讯】中国国民党革命委员会为抗议美、澳、希三国政府摧残人权的声明如下：
    最近美帝国主义御用法院对于美国共产党领袖和为美共领袖辩护的律师的判决，美帝走狗澳大利亚反动政府对于澳国共产党领袖的判决，美帝走狗希腊反动政府对于希国革命领袖的判决，完全暴露了法西斯主义的狰狞面目，激起了世界各国人民的公愤。
    我们对于美、澳、希三国反动政府的摧毁人民基本人权的行为，万分憎恶；我们对于为谋人类和平幸福而被野蛮迫害的美、澳两国共产党领袖和为谋人民解放而被野蛮迫害的希腊革命领袖，万分同情。
    我们愿意和各国人民站在拥护世界民主和平方面，站在争取人民解放方面，为打倒帝国主义、法西斯主义而努力奋斗。同时希望各国人民尤其是美国人民，加紧团结，反抗法西斯主义之威胁，并制止战争贩子之阴谋。
