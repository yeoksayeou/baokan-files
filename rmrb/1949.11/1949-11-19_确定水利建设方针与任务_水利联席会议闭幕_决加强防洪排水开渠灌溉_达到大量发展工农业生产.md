Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 18th – The Water Conservancy Joint Conference of various liberated areas concluded successfully today. The conference opened on the 8th. From the 9th to the morning of the 12th, reports on water conservancy work from Central China, East China, Northeast China, Northwest China, and North China were heard. Then, experts in the field of water conservancy delivered special reports on issues related to water conservancy construction. On the 14th, Li Baohua, Deputy Minister of Water Conservancy, delivered a report on the guidelines and tasks of water conservancy construction, which, after group and plenary discussions for two consecutive days, was unanimously approved.

　　The closing ceremony was held this morning. Fu Zuoyi, Minister of Water Conservancy, gave a summary report of the conference at the closing ceremony. Minister Fu first praised the leading comrades and the broad masses in the liberated areas for their heroic struggle against floods. He said: According to past records, the Yellow River has a possibility of breaching its banks when the flow rate reaches 4,000 cubic meters per second, and a 75% chance of breaching when the flow rate reaches 10,000. In the past two years, the Yellow River flow has exceeded 10,000, and it has been safely navigated, which well illustrates the great victory achieved in the struggle against the Yellow River in the North China and East China liberated areas in recent years. Minister Fu then pointed out the achievements of this conference. He said that the conference focused on discussing the following issues and reached unanimous agreement. These issues are: the current guidelines and tasks for water conservancy construction, the work plan for 1950, and the organization and leadership of future work. Minister Fu said: Regarding the focus of work in 1950, the unanimous opinion of the conference is that in flood-threatened areas, the emphasis should be on flood control and drainage; in arid areas, the emphasis should be on canal irrigation to ensure and increase agricultural production; at the same time, the investigation and research of water conservancy should be strengthened to prepare for long-term construction in the future. As for hydropower projects, channel improvement, canal excavation, and other undertakings, in 1950, they should be selectively undertaken or prepared for based on actual needs and specific conditions such as manpower, materials, and technology. Minister Fu pointed out that the task of water conservancy work is to develop water resources to achieve large-scale development of industry and agriculture. He said: We have full confidence in completing this task because our confidence is based on a reliable material foundation and full mental preparation. Finally, he called on scientists, technicians, and water conservancy administrative staff engaged in water conservancy work to unite, rely on the masses, respond to Chairman Mao's call, and dedicate themselves to the glorious cause of launching a high tide of economic construction.

　　After Minister Fu's report, Li Baohua, Deputy Minister of Water Conservancy, delivered the closing address. Deputy Minister Li offered five points to encourage all water conservancy workers: 1. In terms of water conservancy projects, we must plan meticulously and strive for economy; 2. This conference has initially determined the work plan for 1950, and all localities must strive to implement it; 3. We must unite, take care of the overall situation, and oppose the tendency of departmentalism; 4. Maintain close ties with the masses. Anything that is divorced from the masses will definitely not be done well; 5. Technical personnel should pay attention to political study to grasp the overall direction of work. All water conservancy cadres should strive to learn and improve their technical and scientific theories. After Deputy Minister Li's speech, Sun Xiaocun, Deputy Director of the Planning Bureau of the Central Finance and Economics Commission, spoke. Deputy Director Sun pointed out the close relationship between water conservancy work and other work to illustrate the importance of this work. He said that only by overcoming floods can other production and construction work be fully guaranteed.

　　Xu Juefei, Director of the Department of Agriculture of Hubei Province, Wang Xuanhua, Director of the Department of Industry of Fujian Province, and Chen Mingshao, Professor of the Engineering College of Peking University, also spoke at the closing ceremony. The conference closed after passing a telegram of tribute to Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

　　确定水利建设方针与任务
  　水利联席会议闭幕
    决加强防洪排水开渠灌溉
    达到大量发展工农业生产
    【新华社北京十八日电】各解放区水利联席会议今日圆满结束。会议于八日开幕，自九日至十二日上午听取华中、华东、东北、西北、华北各区水利工作的报告，然后由水利界的专家们做有关水利建设问题的专题报告。十四日水利部副部长李葆华做了关于水利建设方针和任务的报告，经分组及大会连续两天的讨论，已得到一致的同意。
    会议于今日上午举行闭幕式。水利部部长傅作义在闭幕式中作会议总结报告。傅部长在报告中首先对各解放区领导同志和广大群众与洪水的英勇搏斗，备致赞扬。他说：根据过去记载，黄河流量达四千秒立方公尺时就有决口可能，达一万流量时决口的可能性有百分之七十五。去今两年黄河流量都到过一万以上，而能安全渡过，这就很好地说明了华北、华东解放区几年来的对黄水斗争获得了伟大的胜利。傅部长接着指出了这次会议的成就。他说这次会议着重讨论了下列问题，而且得到了一致的意见。这些问题是：当前水利建设的方针与任务、一九五○年工作计划，以及今后工作的组织与领导问题。傅部长说：关于一九五○年工作的重点，会议一致的意见是，在受洪水威胁的地区，应着重于防洪排水；在乾旱地区则应着重开渠灌溉，以保障和增加农业生产；同时应加强水利事业的调查研究工作，以准备今后长期建设。至于水力工程，航道整理，运河开凿等事业，在一九五○年内应根据实际需要，和人力、物力、技术等具体条件，择要举办或准备举办。傅部长指出水利工作的任务是开发水利，以达到大量发展工农业生产。他说：我们有充分信心完成这个任务。因为我们的信心是建立在可靠的物质基础和充分的精神准备上。最后他号召从事水利工作的科学家们、技术人员们、水利行政工作人员们团结一致，依靠群众，响应毛主席的号召，献身于掀起经济建设高潮的光荣事业。
    傅部长报告毕，由水利部副部长李葆华致闭幕词。李副部长提示五点勉励全体水利工作人员：一、在水利工程方面要精密计划，力求节约；二、此次会议已初步确定了一九五零年的工作计划，各地必须努力贯彻；三、要团结一致，照顾全局，反对本位主义的偏向；四、密切联系群众，任何一件事情脱离了群众就一定做不好；五、技术人员要注意政治学习，才能把握总的工作方向，全体水利干部应努力学习与提高技术和科学理论。李副部长讲话后，中央财经委员会计划局副局长孙晓村讲话，孙副局长指出水利工作与其他工作的密切的关系，以说明这个工作的重要。他说，只有战胜洪水，其他生产建设工作，才能有充分的保证。
    在闭幕式中讲话的还有湖北省农业厅长徐觉非、福建省实业厅长王宣化和北京大学工学院教授陈明绍。会议在通过向毛主席、朱总司令和中国人民解放军致敬的电文后闭幕。
