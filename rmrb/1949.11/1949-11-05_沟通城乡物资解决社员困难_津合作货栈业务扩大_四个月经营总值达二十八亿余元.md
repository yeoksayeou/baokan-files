　　Facilitating Urban-Rural Material Exchange and Addressing Cooperative Members' Difficulties
  　Tianjin Cooperative Depot Expands Business
    Four-Month Operating Value Reaches Over 2.8 Billion Yuan
    [Our Newspaper Tianjin Special Dispatch] The Tianjin First Branch of the North China Cooperative Depot (formerly the Tianjin Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative Depot) has achieved great success in promoting urban-rural material exchange, unified purchasing and sales on behalf of local cooperatives, guaranteeing the sales of production cooperative products in the city, and supplying consumer cooperatives with daily necessities in the four and a half months since its establishment in late May.
    According to statistics, over a hundred cooperative units from various regions have come to Tianjin to purchase and sell products in the past four and a half months. Their scope covers various levels of supply and marketing cooperatives in provinces, cities, and counties such as Northeast China, North China, Shandong, Henan, Rehe, Chahar, and Shanghai. The total operating value is 2,835.5 million yuan. Among them, the value of materials transported to Tianjin from various regions is 923 million yuan, including various grains transported from Northeast China, Bohai, Henan, Taihang, and Central Hebei, wool transported from Northwest China, tobacco from Shandong, sesame oil and tung oil from Henan, and medicinal materials, bristles, and mountain goods transported from Rehe, Shanxi, and Western Liaoning. In addition to assisting local cooperatives in selling materials and special products, the cooperative depot also unified the purchase of industrial finished products and other living materials needed by the cooperatives in various regions, totaling 1,005 million yuan, thereby enabling widespread and normal exchange of urban and rural materials through the depot. In addition, in order to meet the various grain needs of cooperative members in the city and other neighboring areas, the depot took the initiative to purchase 2,000 bolts of cloth from the Cotton Yarn Cloth Company and the city’s cooperative production cooperatives, and transported them to Northeast China to recover 600,000 catties of rice. It also purchased over 1 million catties of wheat from Xuzhou in the wheat-producing area, and over 5,000 bags of flour from Xinxiang. It supplied cooperative members in the city with 3,256,643 catties of various grains and 101,090 catties of various oils. To support the reed mat production of cooperative members in Baiyangdian, the depot cooperated with the Anxin Cooperative in the area, transporting 180,000 catties of millet to the area in exchange for more than 16,600 reed mats, which opened up sales channels for the reed mats and solved most of the living difficulties for the local cooperative members. The total value of the above is 578.8 million yuan. At the same time, the depot also sold more than 6,270 bolts of cloth for the production cooperatives under the leadership of the city’s cooperative, thereby enabling the production cooperatives to accelerate capital turnover and continue to expand reproduction.
