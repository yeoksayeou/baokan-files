　　Northeast Machinery Bureau Planning Department
    Technical Personnel Innovation Record

    (Our report) The technical personnel of the Northeast Machinery Bureau have begun to launch an innovation record movement. In order to rush the drawing of various machine tool blueprints, the Planning Department of the bureau sent many drawing teams to various sites to draw real samples. The team sent to Fushun Power Plant to draw the giant spiral bevel gear milling machine was required to complete it in twenty days. Since many of the draftsmen had never seen this giant specialized machine before, it was initially estimated that it would take at least a month to draw the rough draft. However, as a result of detailed discussions beforehand, specific determination of the implementation steps and manpower allocation, and the teams launched a heated competition, all the work was completed by the tenth day. Then the machine began to be installed. The workers happily said to them: "You are so fast, we disassemble it, you draw it, now we will also innovate records, it will be installed in only five days."

    At the summary meeting, everyone agreed that the main experience this time was to go to the workshop to observe the operation of the machine, help the workers disassemble the machine, talk to them, and absorb their practical experience. The second is full preparation and scientific division of labor beforehand.

    The Planning Department specially printed their experience summary in pictures and distributed it to other factory drawing teams, calling on everyone to learn. The teams wrote letters to the Planning Department, guaranteeing to learn from the Fushun team and put forward challenges. Currently, the upsurge of creating new records is developing among the technical personnel of the Machinery Bureau.

　　东北机械局计划处
    技术人员创新纪录
    本报讯东北机械局技术人员开始掀起创纪录运动。该局计划处为了赶绘各种工作母机的图样，曾派了很多绘图小组到各现场去实样绘制，派到抚顺电场画巨型伞齿铣床的小组，规定二十天完成。由于绘图的人中很多在以前从来没有见到过这一巨型专门机器。据当初估计，至少也要一个月才能把草图画出来。但结果由于事先详细讨论，具体确定进行步骤及人力配备，各组并展开热烈竞赛，到第十天，全部的工作就完成了。接着机器就开始安装。工友们高兴的对他们说：“你们真快，我们拆到那儿，你们就画到那儿，现在我们也要来创新纪录，只用五天就把它安装好。”
    在总结会上大家一致认为这次主要经验是到工房里去观察机器的运转，帮着工人拆卸机器，找他们谈话，吸收他们的实际经验。其次是事前充分的准备与科学分工。
    计划处特将他们经验总结用画面印出来，分发给其他各厂画图的小组，号召大家学习。各小组纷纷写信给计划处，保证向抚顺小组看齐，并提出挑战。目前创造新纪录运动的热潮正在机械局的技术人员中开展起来。
