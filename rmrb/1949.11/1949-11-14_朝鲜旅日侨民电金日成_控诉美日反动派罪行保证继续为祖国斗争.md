Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 13th. Premier Kim Il-sung of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea received a letter from the Central Committee of the "League of Korean Residents in Japan," representing 600,000 Korean residents in Japan. The letter accuses the Syngman Rhee puppet government of colluding with the reactionary Yoshida government of Japan, under the manipulation of MacArthur, to suppress Korean residents in Japan. It also expresses the determination of Korean residents in Japan to struggle against oppressors at home and abroad. The letter states: "The reactionary Yoshida government, with the support of MacArthur's headquarters, on the first anniversary of the founding of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea – September 8th at 10:00 AM – on the pretext that Korean residents 'violated the occupation forces' ordinances,' actually declared martial law and mobilized thousands of judges, tens of thousands of armed police, and over a million firefighters, even mobilizing mechanized units, to forcibly dissolve the headquarters of the 'League of Korean Residents in Japan' and 48 local organizations. At the same time, they forcibly dissolved the headquarters of the 'League of Korean Democratic Youth in Japan' and 47 local organizations, and issued orders prohibiting members of these two organizations from engaging in public activities, deporting 28 outstanding cadres." The letter points out: "American imperialists vainly attempt to insult us with a policy of division and discord, just as during the Japanese rule. The reactionary measures of the U.S. imperialists and their running dogs are clearly a manifestation of fear of the democratic forces of the Korean people, but they can never weaken our united democratic forces, and can never obstruct our determination to struggle." Korean residents in Japan assured Kim Il-sung: "We will certainly continue to hold high the banner of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and persist in the struggle for the peaceful reunification of the motherland. We firmly believe that our struggle will surely achieve final victory."

    控诉美日反动派罪行保证继续为祖国斗争
    【新华社平壤十三日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国总理金日成，接到“旅日朝鲜人同盟”中央委员会代表六十万旅日朝鲜侨民写给他的一封信，信中控诉李承晚傀儡政府勾结麦克阿瑟操纵下的日本吉田反动政府镇压在日朝鲜侨民的罪行，并表示旅日朝鲜侨民决心对国内外压迫者进行斗争。信中说：“吉田反动政府在麦克阿瑟总部的支持下，于今年朝鲜民主主义人民共和国成立一周年纪念日——九月八日上午十时，以朝鲜侨民“违犯占领军法令”为借口，竟宣布戒严，动员了数千名法官，数万名武装警察和百余万消防队，甚至动员了机械化部队，强迫解散“旅日朝鲜人同盟”总部和四十八个地方组织，同时，强迫解散“旅日朝鲜民主青年同盟”总部和四十七个地方组织，并下令禁止这两个团体的盟员公开活动，驱逐二十八名优秀干部出境。”信中指出：“美帝国主义者妄图用挑拨离间的政策，象日本统治时代一样地侮辱我们。美帝及其走狗的反动措施，显然是畏惧朝鲜人民民主力量的表现，但它绝不能削弱我们团结的民主力量，绝不能阻挠我们斗争的决心。”旅日朝鲜侨民向金日成保证说：“我们一定继续高举着朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的旗帜，坚持为祖国的和平统一而斗争。我们深信，我们的斗争一定会得到最后胜利。”
