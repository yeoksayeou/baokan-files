  　Smashes Espionage Bandit Case
  　Bandit-Agent Li Heming and 22 Others Arrested
    [Beijing News] The Beijing Public Security Bureau cracked a major espionage bandit case on the 6th of this month, arresting 22 spies and bandits including Li Heming. Two pistols, sixteen bullets, reactionary documents, codes, and other items, more than fifty in total, were seized on the spot. Preliminary seizure of stolen goods includes: forty-seven taels of gold, 760,000 yuan in Renminbi, and more than twenty pieces of valuable jewelry and property. After obtaining a lead that the bandits were plotting to rob the home of Li Ruikun at No. 41, Jia, Wangzhima Hutong, Dongsi, the Bureau's Criminal Investigation Brigade launched an investigation, and finally, starting at 4:00 PM on November 6th, all the bandits including Li Heming and the bottom-line contact Gong Xiheng were captured within twenty-four hours. According to the preliminary interrogation results, the bandits confessed that the ringleader Li Heming, also known as Ji Yupeng, was a soldier of fortune and served as the captain of the Japanese puppet Changping police garrison. After the surrender of the Japanese invaders, the suspect rejoined the Kuomintang bandit gang, serving as an extra staff officer in the "Technical Task Force," a secret agent organization of the puppet Military Statistics Bureau. After the liberation of Beijing, not only did the suspect not know to turn over a new leaf, repent and start anew, but he dared to conspire with Li Nianlu, the confidential secretary of the puppet Military Statistics Bureau's Beijing Station, and Guo Wenzhi, the head of the International Intelligence Group of the Bureau, Nie Dongfang, the deputy battalion commander of the puppet Hebei Provincial Security 11th Regiment, and habitual bandits Li Ming, Li Changlin, Bai Yu'en, Chen Qingyu, Li Yunxiang, and others to organize armed robbery, deliberately disrupting revolutionary order. Regarding the crimes of endangering the lives and property of the people, the suspects have initially confessed that since February of this year, they have successively committed twenty-one robberies at No. 77 Lishi Hutong, Deng's residence in Babaokeng, No. 9 Qiansungongtuan, No. 1 Taiping Street, No. 1 Jingshan Houjie, No. 20 Nanchi zi, No. 41 Jia Wangzhima Hutong, and other places. On the night of June 23, the ringleaders Li Heming and Li Changlin opened fire and killed Xia Changyou, the cook of the house, and Li Shichang, a resident of the nearby grain store, when robbing No. 81 Beichang Street. The Municipal Public Security Bureau is continuing its interrogation based on the clues. (Photo attached)
