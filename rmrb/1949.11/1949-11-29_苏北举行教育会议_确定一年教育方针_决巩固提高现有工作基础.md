[Northern Jiangsu News] The Northern Jiangsu Administrative Office recently held the Northern Jiangsu Education Conference, summarizing the past year's education work and defining the future education policy. The conference believes that the achievements of Northern Jiangsu's education work in the past year are reflected in: In terms of school education, the number of colleges and above has increased to five, with a student population of 2,281; 83 public and private secondary schools, a fourfold increase compared to last year, with a student population of 26,349; 12,768 public and private primary schools, a 50% increase compared to last year, with a student population of 737,100. Social education has also developed extensively, and nearly 4,000 cadres have been trained in one year to meet the needs of all parties. These achievements were obtained under the extremely changing and difficult circumstances in Northern Jiangsu. In the past year, Northern Jiangsu has been in the midst of a victorious great advance and comprehensive support for the front. Many teachers went to the front with migrant workers, and many cadres were transferred south. Education administrative departments at all levels enthusiastically invested in supporting the front, and had to temporarily relax their own work. On the other hand, educational funds were limited due to the impact of war service and famine. However, because the old liberated areas already had a relatively solid foundation for education, and the proposal to gradually move towards regularization was put forward last autumn, coupled with the unremitting efforts of all education workers, difficulties were overcome and development was achieved. The conference also criticized the shortcomings in education work, such as insufficient understanding of the new type of regularization in the implementation of policies; abuse of collective learning by teachers and students, excessive extracurricular activities, and relaxation of ideological remoulding of students and teachers; teacher training was not planned enough; textbook supply was insufficient; fund allocation was not appropriate enough; especially the leadership still had bureaucracy and passivity in its work; generally, there were also phenomena of disorganization and lack of discipline, which need to be overcome in the future. When discussing the education policy of Northern Jiangsu, the conference jointly recognized that after the long-term impact of the war and the enemy's cruel destruction, the situation in Northern Jiangsu has just stabilized this year, and it has also suffered an unprecedented flood. In the next two or three years, the central task of Northern Jiangsu is to vigorously build water conservancy projects, restore and develop agricultural production. Therefore, the education of Northern Jiangsu cannot be a policy of great development, but should be reorganized, consolidated, and improved on the current basis. The conference determined that the policy and task of education work in Northern Jiangsu in the coming year should be to strive to implement the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, cultivate various construction talents, improve the political and cultural level of the masses, and focus on the current central tasks of Northern Jiangsu, especially production and frugality, and the fundamental solution of water disasters, so as to restore and develop production, and lay a solid foundation for the future development of cultural and educational undertakings. In order to achieve the above tasks, it is necessary to strengthen existing ordinary schools and strive for regularization; reorganize and transform old schools; run schools with specialized nature; strengthen revolutionary schools, training courses, teacher education and on-the-job cadre education. In terms of education popularization, public primary schools must be run well; spare-time education for urban workers and political and cultural education in rural areas must be carried out; in disaster areas, close integration with the people and the creation of various conditions are necessary to insist on running schools well. Furthermore in various movements the entire cultural movement of Northern Jiangsu should be gradually launched to improve the political and cultural level of the working class and peasantry.

　　苏北举行教育会议
  　确定一年教育方针
  　决巩固提高现有工作基础
    【苏北讯】苏北行政公署在最近举行的苏北教育会议上，总结了过去一年的教育工作，确定了今后的教育方针。会议认为一年来苏北教育工作的成绩表现在：学校教育方面，专科以上学校增至五所，学生已达二千二百八十一人；公私立中等学校八十三所，比去年增加四倍，学生已达二万六千三百四十九人；公私立小学一万二千七百六十八所，比去年增加百分之五十，学生已有七十三万七千一百余人。社会教育方面也有广泛的发展，并在一年中培植出干部近四千人，以供应各方的需要。这些成绩，是在苏北极大变化而又困难的情形下获得的；一年来，苏北处于胜利大进军和全面支前中，很多教师随民工一起出征，不少干部被抽调南下，各级教育行政部门都热烈地投入支援前线，不得不暂时放松本位工作；另一方面也因战勤、灾荒的影响，教育经费受到限制。可是，终因为老区教育工作已具有相当巩固的基础，以及去秋提出逐渐走向正规化，和全体教育工作者的不懈努力，克服了困难，获得了发展。会议同时批判了教育工作中的缺点，譬如在方针的执行上，对新型正规化的认识不足；滥用教师与学生的集体学习，课外活动过于频繁，放松了对学生、教师的思想改造；师资的培养还不够有计划；教科书供应不及；经费分配还不够恰当；特别是领导上还存在着事务主义与官僚主义，工作被动；一般的还有无组织无纪律的现象等，都需要今后予以克服的。会议在讨论苏北教育方针时，共同认定苏北在长期战争的影响和敌人残酷的破坏之后，今年情况刚刚稳定，又遭到空前的水灾，今后两三年内苏北的中心任务，是大力兴修水利，恢复与发展农业生产，因此，苏北教育，还不可能是大发展的方针，应该在现在基础上整顿巩固与提高。会议确定：苏北今后一年教育工作的方针与任务，应是努力贯彻人民政协共同纲领，培养各种建设人材，提高群众政治文化水平，围绕苏北当前的中心任务，特别是生产节约、根治水患，以恢复发展生产，为今后发展文教事业打下坚实基础。为了实现上述任务，必须加强现有的普通学校，力求正规化；整理与改造旧的学校；办好专科性质的学校；加强革命学校、训练班、师资教育与在职干部教育。在教育普及上，须办好公立小学；开展城市工人的业余教育和农村中的政治文化教育；在灾区，应与人民密切结合，创造各种条件，把学校坚持办好，并在各种运动中逐步开展全苏北的文化运动，以提高工农大众的政治文化水平。
