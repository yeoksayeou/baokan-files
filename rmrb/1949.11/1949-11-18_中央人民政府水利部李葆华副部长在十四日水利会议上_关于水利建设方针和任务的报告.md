Vice Minister of the Ministry of Water Resources of the Central People's Government, Li Baohua, Reports on Water Conservancy Construction Guidelines and Tasks at the Water Conservancy Conference on the 14th.

The nationwide victory of the Liberation War has been basically achieved, and the reactionaries who weighed down on the people have been fundamentally overthrown. This new situation has elevated the task of economic construction to a primary position. Water conservancy construction is an important link in economic construction. The CPPCC meeting stipulated water conservancy undertakings such as water conservancy construction, flood and drought prevention in the Common Program; the Central People's Government attaches great importance to water conservancy undertakings, and the people are also extremely concerned about water conservancy undertakings. Our water conservancy workers must work hard to realize the wishes of the government and the people. To this end, we should first recognize the current situation and put forward the guidelines and tasks for water conservancy construction.

China has a vast territory and many rivers, and the future of water conservancy is extremely broad. This provides our people with endless resources that can be developed. However, like other departments, the legacy that old China left us in terms of water conservancy is very weak. Especially in the 20-plus years of reactionary rule by the Kuomintang, there was only destruction and no construction. They did not hesitate to sacrifice the lives and property of millions of people, arbitrarily breaching and blocking the Yellow River, using it as a tool to preserve reactionary forces and attack the people. As a result, not only has the fundamental problem of major rivers not been solved, but the repair and defense projects are also very weak, leaving the people with serious difficulties and disasters. The floods in many newly liberated areas this year, such as East China, Central China, and East Hebei, which caused serious famines, are examples. However, the hardworking Chinese people, under the leadership of Chairman Mao of the Communist Party of China and the Central People's Government, have constantly overcome and will continue to overcome these difficulties and complete their own water conservancy construction. As early as the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation, we led the masses to overcome various difficulties and carried out huge and arduous work such as flood control, drainage, well digging, canal opening, drought prevention, and famine relief in an environment of constant enemy sabotage and disturbance, achieving great results and overcoming several serious floods and droughts. We won the victory over the great flood in North China in 1939 and the continuous severe droughts in Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu in 1942 and 1943, and this year we also achieved victory in the struggle against the Yellow River flood, which played a certain guaranteeing role in the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation. Now that the Central People's Government has been established, the country will be completely unified, and the Ministry of Water Resources, which uniformly leads water conservancy undertakings, has been established under the Central People's Government. Water conservancy undertakings are even more equipped with the conditions for smooth development. However, since the war has not yet completely ended, and there are still certain difficulties in manpower and financial resources, this situation must also be taken into account when formulating our water conservancy guidelines and tasks.

Based on the above situation, what guidelines and tasks should we put forward for the current water conservancy construction work?

First, the basic guideline for water conservancy construction is to prevent water disasters and build water conservancy projects in order to achieve the goal of greatly developing production. Under this principle, we must, in accordance with the national economic construction plan and the needs of the people, and according to different situations and conditions such as manpower, financial resources, and technology, distinguish between priorities and urgency, and restore and develop water conservancy undertakings such as flood control, irrigation, drainage, siltation, water power, river dredging, and canal construction in a planned and step-by-step manner.

Second, all water conservancy undertakings must be planned as a whole, coordinated with each other, and unified under leadership and water administration. In a water system, the upper and lower reaches, and the main tributaries should be considered as a whole, taking into account the overall situation.

Third, in order to ensure and increase agricultural production, current water conservancy construction should focus on flood control, drainage, irrigation, and siltation.

Fourth, in order to facilitate mutual assistance between urban and rural areas, inland waterway channels should be rectified and canals should be opened in a planned manner.

Fifth, in order to cooperate with the development of light and heavy industry, water power undertakings should be investigated and developed in a planned and step-by-step manner in conjunction with industrial departments.

Sixth, for the fundamental treatment of each river, the first thing is to study the original fundamental treatment plans of each important water system, and formulate new plans on this basis. For those who do not have a fundamental treatment plan, a plan should be researched and formulated as soon as possible. As for individual fundamental treatment projects that have the conditions for construction, they can also be implemented in a focused and partial manner after approval. The collection, research and sorting of basic data of each water system should be regarded as one of the important tasks.

Seventh, in order to adapt to the needs of water conservancy construction, water conservancy institutions should be actively strengthened, water conservancy talents should be cultivated in a planned manner, and the knowledge of water conservancy construction should be improved.

The above seven items are our current water conservancy construction guidelines and tasks. Based on the above guidelines and tasks, we should also put forward preliminary opinions on the water conservancy construction work in 1950.

In 1950, water conservancy construction should focus on flood control and drainage in flood-threatened areas, and should focus on opening canals for irrigation in arid areas to ensure and increase agricultural production. At the same time, the investigation and research of water conservancy undertakings should be strengthened to lay the foundation for long-term water conservancy construction in the future. As for water power projects, channel rectification, and canal excavation, they should be selectively organized or prepared for organization according to actual needs and specific conditions such as manpower, material resources, financial resources, and technology.

In terms of flood control, the principle should be to strengthen existing embankments. A certain construction standard should be stipulated according to the flood level in previous years. The embankments of the Yellow River, Yangtze River, and Huai River should be stipulated at a certain height and adapted slope according to the specific conditions of each place. Other rivers should follow this spirit to formulate standards. The breaches that must be blocked must be blocked, dangerous works must be selectively repaired, and spring works must be strengthened in a planned manner to avoid wasting manpower and material resources during the flood season. Large-scale fundamental treatment projects should not be easily constructed before there are accurate plans and reliable guarantees, but should be thoroughly investigated and surveyed, and fully prepared. At present, the combination and adaptation of temporary and fundamental treatment projects.

In terms of drainage, the focus is on solving the problem of rainwater accumulation and breach accumulation. This year, the area of rainwater accumulation in North China alone reached more than 21.1 million mu. The leadership must take out a certain amount of strength, seize this central work in a certain period and a certain area, and make achievements. The principle of small interests obeying large interests and large interests taking care of small interests should be used to conduct in-depth publicity, mobilization and organization work among the masses. The specific requirements for next year, in addition to frequently flooded lakes, the rainwater flooding in general low-lying areas should be drained in time, and at the very least, it should not delay spring plowing. In order to reduce the disaster area, planning to dig drainage ditches in advance in low-lying areas to connect to lakes and rivers is an effective way to solve the drainage problem. This point should also be noted when making plans in various places.

In terms of irrigation, on the one hand, attention should be paid to restoring and continuing to complete unfinished projects, and at the same time, new projects that have the conditions for development should also be actively carried out.

The recruitment and training of water conservancy talents, and the unity and education of water conservancy cadres should also be regarded as one of the main tasks. In the past, the water conservancy circles had this faction and that faction. This is a bad habit left over from the old society and should be eliminated in the era of people's democracy. We require that technical cadres, technical cadres and administrative cadres, and new and old cadres should be closely united, wholeheartedly working hard for the water conservancy cause. The widespread development of our work and the lack of cadres are inevitable phenomena. We must work hard to train cadres to overcome this difficulty. All water conservancy administrative cadres must work hard to learn the business and master the business. Only in this way can we do our work well. For all cadres in water conservancy work, we require continuous improvement of political, water conservancy knowledge and technical level. At the same time, we must encourage everyone to dedicate themselves to this construction undertaking of great significance from the perspective of learning, work interest, and various systems.

Regarding the projects for next year, each region has put forward its own preliminary plan. After everyone's research, they are divided into three items: urgent, important, and secondary. This distinction is more appropriate. We plan to review these plans separately before the end of the meeting to decide whether to hold them. Here, I would like to explain a few principles regarding the formulation and review of plans and how to allocate funding burdens: First, we must determine whether our projects will be held based on the two conditions of necessity and possibility. The so-called necessity refers to the cause that is urgently to be held. If it is not held, it will severely affect the lives of the people. Generally speaking, the urgent projects proposed by various regions this time are all necessary. Flood control funds account for the main part of the urgent projects, which is the most urgent work requested by the people. The second is the opening of canals for irrigation, which is also a cause that the people urgently want to be held. The above two items play an important role in the development of agricultural production next year. The so-called possibility is to take care of our current economic conditions. If economic conditions permit, it can be held, and if economic conditions do not permit, it will not be held or postponed. According to our current economic conditions, the war has not completely ended, and there are still many difficulties in finance and economy. The government's investment in water conservancy is still limited. Therefore, it is necessary to distinguish between necessity and possibility, and distinguish between priorities and urgency. On the one hand, we must concentrate our efforts and actively construct. At the same time, we must oppose the idea of ​​reviving everything, because this idea will make us unable to accomplish anything and will make all our undertakings empty talk. Second, in terms of funding burdens, how the central and local finances are divided has not yet been finalized. Therefore, water conservancy project funds can be temporarily divided into public funds, mass self-management, and government loan assistance, regardless of the central and local levels. As for which projects are run by the public and which are run by the masses, it should be based on different situations, weighing the pros and cons, and the representatives attending the meeting should discuss in detail and put forward specific opinions for appropriate decision-making. Third, the procedure for reviewing the project plan. Some important project plans, in addition to being reviewed by the Ministry of Water Resources, must also be submitted to the State Council and the Central Finance and Economics Commission for review and approval. General plans are reviewed by the Ministry of Water Resources. Some local water conservancy projects are discussed and approved by the local government and reported to the Ministry of Water Resources for record. Fourth, we require that every project must undergo detailed investigation and measurement and make accurate plans and budgets. When formulating plans and budgets, unified engineering standards should be stipulated, and more causes should be handled with the least amount of funds. The plan should be practical and specific, and signed and sealed by the administrative负责人 and engineering负责人, and submitted to a certain superior for approval before construction can begin. Resolutely overcome the bad style of not reporting plans and arbitrarily constructing. Once the plan is decided, all forces should be organized and all methods should be thought out to achieve it successfully. During the process of the project, inspections should be carried out in a planned manner, errors should be discovered and corrected, the progress of the plan should be checked at any time, and attention should be paid to discovering good experiences as typical examples for promotion. The formulation and construction of water conservancy project plans must take a cautious attitude. In the past, during the war, there were often only rough plans, and construction was started rashly, which often resulted in uneconomical and unreasonable results, or even failure halfway, wasting construction funds in vain. These lessons must be learned. Today, when the new people's water conservancy cause is developing, a good style must be established from the beginning, and the pursuit of quick success and unrealistic and huge plans must be opposed. This change of style still needs to go through a certain process. The leading comrades of water conservancy organs in various regions and river basins must first understand this issue, and then conduct continuous education to the lower levels to establish a scientific and regular style. Only in this way can the smooth development of water conservancy undertakings in the future be guaranteed.

　　中央人民政府水利部李葆华副部长在十四日水利会议上         
    关于水利建设方针和任务的报告
    全国解放战争取得了基本胜利，压在人民头上的反动派，已经根本上被打倒。这个新的形势，使得经济建设的任务，提到了首要的地位。水利建设，是经济建设中重要的一环。政协会议把兴修水利，防洪防旱等水利事业规定在共同纲领中；中央人民政府对水利事业极为重视，人民对水利事业也是异常关心的。我们水利工作者必须努力工作以实现政府与人民的愿望。为此，首先应该认清目前的状况，提出水利建设的方针与任务。
    中国地域广大，河流众多，水利事业的前途，极其广阔。这给我国人民提供了无穷尽的可以开发的资源。但是旧中国，在水利方面给我们的遗产，也如其他部门一样，是很薄弱的。特别是在国民党反动统治的二十多年来，只破坏不建设。他们曾不惜牺牲千百万人民的生命财产，对黄河任意扒口堵口，用作保存反动势力与进攻人民的工具。因之，各大河流，不但治本问题没有解决，即修防工程亦十分薄弱，给人民遗留下严重的困难和灾害。今年许多新解放的地区，如华东、华中、翼东等地均有洪水泛滥，造成了严重的大灾荒，就是例证。但是，勤劳的中国人民，在中国共产党毛主席和中央人民政府领导下，曾不断地克服了并且能够继续克服这些困难，完成自己的水利建设事业。早在抗日战争和解放战争时期，我们即领导群众，克服了各种困难，在敌人不断破坏与扰乱的环境下，进行了防洪、排水、挖井、开渠和防旱、渡荒等巨大的艰苦工作，取得了很大的成绩，战胜了几次严重的水灾和旱灾。战胜了一九三九年的华北大水灾及一九四二年和一九四三年晋冀鲁豫连续的大旱灾，今年与黄河洪水斗争也取得了胜利，这对于抗日战争与解放战争的胜利起了一定的保证作用。现在中央人民政府已经成立，全国已将完全统一，而且在中央人民政府下设立了统一领导水利事业的水利部。水利事业更具备了顺利开展的条件。但是由于战争尚未完全结束，人力财力还存在着一定程度的困难，因之，在规定我们水利方针和任务的时候，这一情况也必须考虑在内。
    根据上述情况，我们对于当前水利建设工作应该提出什么方针和任务呢？
    第一，水利建设的基本方针，是防止水患，兴修水利，以达到大量发展生产的目的。在这一原则下，我们要依照国家经济建设计划和人民的需要，根据不同的情况和人力财力及技术等条件，分别轻重缓急，有计划、有步骤地恢复并发展防洪、灌溉、排水、放淤、水力、疏浚河流，兴修运河等水利事业。
    第二，各项水利事业必须统筹规划，相互配合，统一领导，统一水政。在一个水系上，上下游，本支流，尤应统筹兼顾，照顾全局。
    第三，为保障与增加农业生产，目前水利建设应着重于防洪、排水、灌溉、放淤等工作。
    第四，为便利城乡互助，应从事内河航道的整理，并有计划地开凿运河。
    第五，为配合轻重工业的发展，应与工业部门相结合，有计划、有步骤地调查开发水力事业。
    第六，对于各河流的治本工作，首先是研究各重要水系原有的治本计划，以此为基础制订新的计划。尚无治本计划者，应从速研究拟定计划。至于已具备了施工条件的个别治本工程，经过批准后，亦可有重点地部分实施。对各水系基本资料的搜集、研究和整理，自应视为重要工作之一。
    第七，为适应水利建设的需要，应积极地充实水利机构，有计划地培植水利人材，提高水利建设的知识。
    以上七项，便是我们当前水利建设的方针与任务。根据以上的方针和任务，我们亦应提出关于一九五○年的水利建设工作的初步意见。
    一九五○年的水利建设，在受洪水威胁的地区应着重于防洪排水，在干旱地区则应着重开渠灌溉，以保障与增加农业生产。同时应加强水利事业的调查研究工作，以打下今后长期水利建设的基础。至于水力工程、航道整理、运河开凿等事业，应根据实际需要和人力、物力、财力、技术等具体条件，择要举办或准备举办。
    在防洪方面，应以加强现有堤防为原则。根据历年洪水位，规定一定的修筑标准。黄河、长江、淮河堤防应按各地具体情况分别规定一定的高度，与适应的边坡。其他各河本此精神，制定标准。堵复必须堵复的决口，择要修筑险工，有计划地加强春工，以免防汛期间浪费人力、物力。较大的治本工程，在没有精确计划和可靠把握以前，不轻易施工，而应切实调查勘测，充分准备。目前治标工程与治本工程相结合、相适应。
    在排水方面，以解决雨潦积水及决口积水为重点。今年雨潦面积，仅华北地区即达二千一百余万亩。领导上必须拿出一定力量，在一定时期、一定地区抓紧这个中心工作，做出成绩。本小利服从大利，大利照顾小利的原则对群众进行深入宣传动员和组织工作。明年具体要求，除经常积水的湖泊以外，一般洼下地区的雨潦河淹，争取及时泄干，最低限度，亦应使之不误春耕。为使灾区缩小，有计划地在低洼地区事先挖好泄水沟渠，通入湖泊和河流，乃是解决排水问题的有效办法。各地做计划时，也应注意此点。
    在灌溉方面，一方面应注意恢复与继续完成未完工程，同时对有条件开辟的新工程，也应积极进行。
    关于水利人才的罗致培养，水利干部的团结教育，也应视为主要任务之一。过去的水利界，有过这个派、那个派，这是旧社会遗留下来的不良习惯，在人民民主的时代是应该消灭了。我们要求技术干部间、技术干部与行政干部间、新老干部间都应紧密团结，一心一意，为水利事业努力工作。我们的工作普遍展开，干部缺乏是必然的现象，我们必须努力培养干部，克服这个困难。一切水利行政干部要努力学习业务精通业务。只有这样，才会把工作作好。对于水利工作全体干部来讲，我们要求不断提高政治的、水利知识的与技术的水平。同时，我们要从学习上、工作兴趣上以及从各种制度上鼓舞大家长期献身于这个具有重要意义的建设事业。
    关于明年的工程，各区都已提出了自己的初步计划。经过大家的研究，分为急要的、重要的与次要的三项，这样区分是比较恰当的。对于这些计划，我们准备在会议结束以前，分别进行审查，决定是否举办。这里仅就制定与审查计划及如何分配经费负担的几项原则，加以说明：第一，要根据必需与可能两个条件，确定我们的工程是否举办。所谓必需，就是指急于要举办的事业，如不举办，则将剧烈地影响人民的生活。各地区此次所提出的急要工程，一般说来都是必需的。急要工程中防洪的经费占了主要部分，这是人民最迫切要求的一件工作。其次就是开渠灌溉，这也是人民迫切要求举办的事业。以上两项对明年农业生产的发展，起着重要的作用。所谓可能，就是要照顾我们目前的经济条件。经济条件允许，则可举办，经济条件不允许则不举办或暂缓举办。按我们今天的经济条件，战争还未完全结束，财政经济上还存在很多困难，政府对水利事业的投资，还是有一定限度的。因此必须分清必需与可能，分清轻重缓急。我们一方面要集中力量，积极建设，同时，也要反对百废俱举的思想，因为这一思想将使我们一事无成，将使我们一切事业流于空谈。第二，在经费负担方面，目前中央和地方财政如何划分尚未最后决定，因之水利工程经费，暂可不分中央和地方，只能分为公款举办、群众自办和政府贷款扶助三种。至于那些工程由公办，那些由群众办，应根据不同情况，权衡利害大小，由到会代表详加讨论，提出具体意见，以便酌量决定。第三，工程计划审查的程序，有些重要的工程计划，除由水利部审查外，尚须提交政务院和中央财委审查与批准。一般性的计划，由水利部审查。有些属于地方性的水利工程，由地方政府讨论批准报水利部备案。第四，我们要求对每一工程，必须经过详密的调查测量并做出精确的计划与预算。在制定计划与预算时，应规定统一的工程标准，用最少的经费办更多的事业。计划要切实具体，经过行政负责人、工程负责人签名盖章，报请一定的上级批准，始能动工，坚决克服不报计划任意施工的不良作风。计划既经决定，则应组织一切力量，想出一切办法，使之胜利实现。工程进行中，要有计划地进行检查，发现错误，纠正错误，随时检查计划进行的程度，并注意发现好的经验，作为典型，加以推广。水利工程计划的制订与施工必须采取慎重态度。过去在战争期间，往往只有大致计划，即冒然施工，每致造成不经济、不合理的结果，甚至中途失败，徒糜工款。这些教训必须记取。今天，新的人民的水利事业正在开展的时候，必须在一开始就要打下一个好的作风，反对急于求成和不切实际的庞大计划。这一作风的转变，尚须经过一定的过程，各地区各流域水利机关的领导同志，首先要了解这一问题，然后对下级进行不断的教育，建立起科学的正规的作风。只有这样，才能保证今后水利事业的顺利发展。
