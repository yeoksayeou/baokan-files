　　The First Soviet I Met
　　Lü Fangdong
　　Ever since I learned about the socialist country of the Soviet Union, I have loved it and its people.

　　I really wanted to meet them, those Soviet friends. They united for the first time in history to liberate themselves and brought hope to all the oppressed and exploited people of the world. What kind of people are these remarkable Soviets? I really wanted to meet them.

　　But, in our country, in the past, the foreigners one saw were always British, American, or Japanese, or even White Russians. They rampaged through our country, walking with their noses in the air. The reactionary government of Chiang Kai-shek artificially separated the Soviet people from the Chinese people.

　　In the early days of the War of Resistance Against Japan, when the Soviet Union aided us with a large amount of manpower and material resources, it was difficult to see any news about this in the newspapers controlled by the Kuomintang authorities. One could only occasionally hear rumors about how the Soviet Union was helping us. But, in Wuhan, as the Japanese devils approached, I finally met a Soviet.

　　At that time, the Japanese had already captured Nanjing, Xuzhou, and Kaifeng, and were advancing on Wuhan; American imperialism was feeding this aggressor with its steel and oil; British imperialists were blockading the Burma Road. They were all trying to conquer us and strangle us. Only the Soviet Union was helping us. Soviet air forces flew in our skies, defending the people of our great Wuhan.

　　That day, I and a group of students were evacuating outside Wuhan to avoid air raids.

　　Continuous air raids had caused severe damage to Wuhan: houses collapsed, walls crumbled, everywhere were bomb craters several feet deep, here a pool of flesh and blood, there a pile of rubble, bloody rags stuck to the broken walls, fresh human legs hanging on tree branches! …

　　But that day the devils did not have time to bomb. They were defeated. A large squadron of planes intercepted the invaders and fought at high altitude in the suburbs. That squadron was so brave and so agile that it immediately disrupted the enemy's formation, chasing the enemy like an eagle chasing sparrows.

　　Machine guns chattered continuously in the high sky like frying beans.

　　An enemy plane smoked at the tail and fell down.

　　Another enemy plane smoked at the tail and fell down.

　　The third enemy plane caught fire, cocked its tail and fell straight down.

　　People below watched, forgetting that they were exposing their targets, desperately clapping and shouting.

　　One of our planes was the bravest. It single-handedly shot down three enemy planes. Just as it was chasing the fourth, another enemy plane suddenly came from the side. A burst of fierce machine gun fire wounded it. A black dot popped out of the plane, and a parachute opened in the sky, slowly falling, falling.

　　An enemy plane circled the parachute and fired at it. People on the ground were holding their breath. "Bless, bless!" Many people couldn't help but blurt out this prayer.

　　However, the parachute seemed to stop in mid-air, it just floated there and would not come down. The enemy plane desperately locked on and strafed with machine guns. Our planes chased it away, then another flew in, then chased it away, then another flew in from this side.

　　Ah! How anxious! If I could fly at that time, that would be great! Watching that white parachute, I couldn't help but feel my heart and guts contract, the tip of my nose turn sour, and my eyes filled with tears. …Oh, if I could fly at that time!…

　　Finally, our flying general landed on the ground. His head and body were covered in blood, and he lay down on the grass by the Yangtze River. He was injured.

　　Fortunately, the injury was not serious. Seeing us gathered around, he still smiled, nodding at us all the time.

　　White skin, blue eyes, a foreigner. But not British, nor American; someone spoke to him in English, he didn't understand. We didn't understand what he said either.

　　As people bandaged him, a student suddenly shouted "Hurrah!"

　　"Hurrah!" he followed and echoed. He smiled even more. His two blue eyes sparkled.

　　Ah, a Soviet! The Soviet I had wanted to meet for many years but had never been able to meet.

　　Soviets, when our motherland was suffering, when the imperialists were trying to conquer us and strangle us, they used their lives to help us, to fight the invaders for us. I went closer and tightly squeezed his hand. I longed to say something to him, but I couldn't. My throat choked up, and I only vaguely shouted "Hurrah!"

　　"Hurrah!" he also squeezed my hand and responded like this.

　　"Hurrah!"

　　"Hurrah!"

　　The students shouted frantically, tightly surrounding him, this Soviet.

　　When we managed to get a stretcher to carry him away, the invaders in the sky had been driven away. This time the enemy's air raid on Wuhan completely failed, and not a single bomb was dropped on Wuhan that day, but nine enemy planes were destroyed by us.

### 我见到的第一个苏联人

　　我见到的第一个苏联人
    吕方东
    从我知道苏联这个社会主义的国家以后，我便热爱上了它和它国家的人民。
    我真想见一见他们，那些苏联的朋友。他们破天荒第一次团结起来翻了身，并给全世界一切被压迫者被剥削者带来了希望。这些了不起的苏联人，是些怎样的人呢？我真想见一见他们。
    但，在我们国度里，在从前，看得见的外国人，碰来碰去尽是一些英国人、美国人、日本人，再不然便是些白俄。他们在我们国内横冲直撞，鼻孔向天走路。苏联人和我们中国人民间，被蒋介石的反动政府人为地隔开了。
    抗战初期，苏联以大量人力物力援助我们时，被国民党官方统制的报纸上很难看到一点有关这样的新闻，只能偶然听到一点苏联在怎样援助我们的传说。但，在武汉，在日本鬼子逼近时，我终于见到了一个苏联人。
    那时日本人已经夺去南京、徐州和开封，正在进犯大武汉；美帝国主义在以自己的钢铁油料喂养这个侵略者；英帝国主义者则封锁了滇缅路。他们一致企图征服我们，扼杀我们。只有苏联在援助我们。苏联的空军飞翔在我国的天空，保卫我们大武汉人民。
    那一天，我同一群学生疏散在武汉效外避空袭。
    连续的空袭已使武汉遭受严重的损失：屋倒了，墙塌了，到处都是几丈深的炸弹坑，这里一滩血肉，那里一堆瓦砾，断墙上贴着血淋淋的布片，树枝上挑着新鲜的人腿！……
    可是那一天鬼子没有来得及轰炸。它被打败了。一大队飞机拦住侵略者在郊外高空搏斗。那队飞机是这样英勇，这样敏捷，一下就打乱了敌机的阵容，好象老鹰逐麻雀似地追打着敌人。
    机关枪在高空中象炒豆子似地不断叫。
    一架敌机尾巴上冒烟，跌下了。
    又一架敌机尾巴上冒烟，跌下了。
    第三架敌机着了火，翘起尾巴笔直往下落。
    人们在下面看，都忘了自己暴露目标，拚命拍手，喊叫。
    我们的飞机中有一架最英勇。它一下子独力打下了敌机三架。正当它追逐着第四架时，冷不防斜刺里穿来另一架敌机。一串猛烈的机关枪声，把它打伤了。一个黑点从那飞机里面弹出来，一朵降落伞张开在天空，慢慢地落下来，落下来。
    一架敌机绕着那架降落伞射击。地面上的人都捏着一把汗。“保佑，保佑！”不少人都禁不住这么脱口而出念起来。
    可是，那降落伞仿佛停在半空中了，它老是浮在那里不下来。敌机死命钉住用机关枪扫射。我们的飞机把它赶跑了，那边又飞来一架，又赶跑了，这边又飞来一架。
    啊！真急煞人！要是那时我能够飞呀，那多好！看着那朵白色的降落伞，禁不住心肝五脏都收缩起来，鼻头尖发酸，眼睛里充满了泪水。……呵，要是我那时能够飞呀！……
    终于，我们的飞将军落到了地上。头上身上全是血，躺倒在扬子江边的草地上。他受伤了。
    幸好伤不重。见我们围拢去，他还笑，一味对我们点着头。
    白皮肤，蓝眼睛，是个外国人。但不是英国人，也不是美国人；有人同他讲英语，他不懂。他讲的话我们也不懂。
    当人们给他包扎时，有个学生忽然喊了声“乌拉！”
    “乌拉！”他紧跟着也应和了一声。他更笑开了。两只蓝眼睛一闪一闪地发亮。
    呵，是个苏联人！我多年想见而始终见不到的苏联人。
    苏联人，当我们祖国在遭受苦难的时候，当帝国主义者们企图征服我们扼杀我们的时候，他们以自己的生命来援助我们，来为我们抗击侵略者。我走近去紧紧地捏住他的手。我渴望对他说几句什么，可是说不出。我的喉咙哽住了，只模模糊糊喊了声“乌拉！”
    “乌拉！”他也捏住我的手，这么应道。
    “乌拉！”
    “乌拉！”
    学生们疯狂似地叫喊了起来，紧紧地包围着他，这个苏联人。
    当我们弄到担架把他抬走时，天空中的侵略者已被打跑了。敌人这一次空袭武汉完全落了空，那天武汉市区始终没有被丢下一颗炸弹，敌机却被我们击毁了九架。
