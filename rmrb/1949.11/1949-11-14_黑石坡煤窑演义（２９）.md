    Twenty-Six: Watching the Mine

    Black Stone Slope was much quieter than before: it was just after the New Year, but there wasn't a sound in the village; Da San had been back for quite a few days, but no one came to see him. He felt bored and wanted to find something to do, but Tianlu's wife said, "Third Brother! People are saying that the village's misfortune is all your fault, so you'd better not go out!" Da San thought, "If I don't go out, won't they come looking for trouble?" He thought: What gods and ghosts! To hell with them! If they want to make trouble, the most they can do is take my life! He turned around and discussed it with Shuancheng. Shuancheng told him: most of the village's kilns had collapsed, leaving only Jubaode's single-shoulder kiln and the jointly-owned small mine; it was very crowded, and even Tianlu's Liugou large kiln couldn't accommodate anyone. Only Xilu's large kiln, which had somehow become Jubaode's, and the West Kiln, where coal could still be mined, were where the unemployed miners, regardless of the Old Lord, wanted to go down and try their luck. Jubaode sent someone to manage it; people mined two loads and got two coins, which they took twenty-three miles away to Shuiyu Jucheng to sell retail. It was said that the kiln's income was split between Jubaode and the temple; Shuancheng had been resting for a few days and was planning to go down to the West Kiln to avoid being idle. Da San couldn't think of anything else to do, and also wanted to see the large kiln he had started, so he found a pair of carrying baskets, took his second brother's broken hoe, and went down to the kiln with Shuancheng, also to take a look around.

    They walked east along the hillside, turned a corner, and saw the village's layers of houses and kilns. Da San stopped and looked at them, saying, "Looking at our village, it's much better than those two years! That temple is so new it's dazzling! Those houses are painted so white!" Shuancheng said, "Of course! The rich people wouldn't let it be otherwise!" Da San cursed, "Damn this world!" and went down the slope with Shuancheng. Just then, a woman in a green cotton cheongsam walked across the north slope. Da San couldn't recognize her from afar, so he patted Shuancheng's shoulder and asked, "Look! Who is that person in our village?" Shuancheng looked and said, "Quiet! That's our village's women's captain, Niu Bao's sister-in-law!" When Da San heard this, he didn't turn his head back and hurried to the large kiln.

    It turned out that the counter room at the large kiln site had collapsed, the stove had been dismantled, and the yard was covered with crushed coal slag. An old man was stooping over, picking up coal slag in the yard. Da San and Shuancheng walked into the yard, and the old man looked up. It was Liugou's family. Her hair was all white, her eyes were dull, and she looked at Da San and said, "It's you! No wonder I heard people say you were back. Da San, you've come back all alone again?" Da San felt that this was rather pointless, so he casually said, "Of course! You've gotten old these past few years!" Liugou's family said, "Haven't you gotten old? You must be in your early forties, right? Alas! In this day and age, what's there to say!" After saying that, Liugou's family went back to picking up coal. Da San and Shuancheng lit their oil lamps, nodded and greeted the people going down into the kiln, and slowly went down. Da San carefully inspected each branch of the tunnel at the bottom of the kiln, constantly calculating and pondering in his mind. After a long time, he stopped to pick up coal.

    At this moment, a person came out of another branch tunnel, with an oil lamp in his mouth, asking unclearly, "Who's there?" When he saw that it was Da San, the man quickly took the oil lamp out of his mouth, looked around to make sure no one was there, and grabbed Da San's arm, saying, "Look, you're back and I haven't even seen you yet!" Da San was surprised to see that it was Xiao Yang Gui, and asked, "You're down in the kiln too?" Xiao Yang Gui said, "Hey! Don't even mention it! Look, you only left the village because you couldn't stay here, right? I figured you couldn't stay out there either, and were forced back, right? Aren't I the same? I swore I would never go down into the kiln again! But damn it, in this day and age, the land doesn't yield enough, people want too much, and there are so many debts to pay! As for the sand goods, we can't travel long distances, and the Xinmin Cooperative at Yangquan Station is only buying and selling exclusively, so we have nothing to do with it! I have a family of five! What can I do? Alas! I can't be afraid of being hit by coal! I don't care about the Old Lord anymore! I can't dig anything, I can't carry anything, and this kiln, as you know, now belongs to the old man Jubaode! I begged Qian Danao to let me hang the scales and watch over the kiln! Even that's not working! Uncle Da San, now there's no demand for retail coal in Shuiyu Jucheng either! There's a shortage of coal in the northern mountains, but people say that's a bandit area, and they're blocking you from going back and forth! That's why there are fewer people going down to the kiln these past two days! Damn it, I think some living people are really going to be forced to death!" Xiao Yang Gui kept talking, and people passed the word that he was being called to hang the scales, so he put the oil lamp back in his mouth, vaguely agreed, and went back up the kiln, sighing unclearly. Only then did Da San and Shuancheng start to dig coal.

    After the two of them had finished digging the coal, they each carried a load out to sell. They walked all over Shuiyu Jucheng, and sure enough: Xiao Yang Gui didn't lie! Fortunately, the coal was good, and they barely managed to exchange it for two coins, half-giving and half-selling, until it was almost dark. The next day, Shuancheng went to Yangquan to find work; Da San had no work, so he had to rest again.

    Da San rested for most of the day, his mind filled with all sorts of thoughts. In the late afternoon, he suddenly went to the vicinity of the large kiln to take a look around again. He had originally made up his mind to wash his hands and never work in the coal mine again. Yesterday, he went down to the West Kiln and carried a load of coal, and saw that although the kiln was unmanaged, without rules, and people were digging and collapsing it in a mess, the coal was really getting stronger and stronger, and it seemed that he could see dozens of miles in at a glance, with an endless sea of coal, gleaming black and bright, making people happy; Da San also inspected the East Kiln, and even calculated it outside the kiln for a while. He felt that the kiln was not ruined, and as long as he stopped messing around and cleaned it up early, it could still be turned into a good kiln. Could it be that Da San really wanted to clean up this large kiln? No, he didn't have such a wild idea from the start; but his heart was always jumping and he couldn't control it, and it was hard to say why. So he remembered Xilu, and felt that he couldn't rest assured without seeing him. To hell with it! At night, he went to Xilu's house.

    黑石坡煤窑演义（２９）
    康濯
    二十六  看窑
    黑石坡比过去冷清得多：刚过年不久，村里却没一点响动；大三回来日子不少了，也没人去看望他。他觉着闷的慌，想找个干的，天禄老婆说：“三兄弟！人家尽说咱一村大祸都是你惹下的，你快别出去了吧！”大三道：“不出去吧，人家要闹事，不会找上门来？”他心想：什么神呀鬼的！管球它哩！要闹吧，多不过是撂了这条命呗！回头就跟拴成商议。拴成告他：村里多数的窑垮了，只剩了聚宝一座担窑和人们碰股闹的个绞窑，人很挤，天禄还在干的柳沟大窑，也插不下人，只喜禄的大窑，不知怎么稀里糊涂地归了聚宝了，那西窑倒还能刨炭，没营生的窑黑们也不管老君爷怎么样，还想下去动弹，聚宝就派了个人给经管着，人们下去刨两担，给两钱，去二十三里地外的水峪巨城零卖，窑上收入听说算是聚宝一半庙上一半；拴成这些天歇了歇，这会也就是打算下这西窑，别没营生。大三也想不出别的干，并想看看自己刨闹起的大窑，也就寻了付担筐，拿了他老二一把破镢头，跟拴成一道下窑，顺便也转游转游去。
    他俩顺半坡往东走了走，拐个弯，就看见了村里一层层的房窑，大三立下来望了两眼，说：“看咱村这架势，比那二年强多啦！那庙真新得晃眼！那房们刷得真白！”拴成道：“可不！财主们还能不强！”大三骂了声：“＠他这世道的！”就跟拴成下了坡。这时只见北坡上有个穿绿棉旗袍的女人走过，大三远远地认不清，就拍着拴成肩膀问：“你看！咱村哪有那号人？”拴成看了看道：“悄悄的吧！那可是咱村妇女队长，牛宝他嫂！”大三一听，头也没回，就抢先往大窑去了。
    却说这大窑窑场上的柜房早塌了，火炉也拆了，场面碎炭渣子一铺摊，有个什么老人人正哈着腰在场上拾炭渣。大三和拴成走到场上，那老人人抬起头来，原来是柳沟家。她头发都花白了，眼也灰塌塌地，看了看大三，说道：“是你呀！怪难我听人说你回了。大三叔，你又是光杆一个回来的？”大三觉着这话挺没意思，就随口道：“可不！你这几年也老了呀！”柳沟家说：“莫非你没老？你也四十出头了吧？唉！这年月，有什么说头啊！”说完，柳沟家又拾炭去了。大三跟拴成点了油扁，一边跟上窑下窑的人们点头打招呼，一边慢慢下窑去。大三在窑底沿着各个岔道细细察看，心中不断盘算捉摸，老大一会，他才停下来拾掇刨炭。
    这时从另一条岔道里走出来个人，油扁把含在嘴里，不清不楚地问道：“谁们呀？”一见是大三，那人忙把油扁从嘴里取下，看看左右无人，就抓住大三胳膊道：“你看你回啦我还没见哩！”大三见是小洋鬼，也吃惊道：“你也下窑啦？”小洋鬼道：“嗨！甭说啦！你看你不是村里呆不下了才出去的么？我思谋你准是外头也呆不下了，又给逼回来的吧？我还不跟你一样样？我是发了誓再不下窑的！可ｃàｏ＠①他妈这年月，地里收不下，人家要得多，款项数不清有多少！砂货嘛，走远道咱不行，阳泉站上新民合作社又一个劲专买专卖，没咱的事！我一家五口哩！我能干什么？唉！反正也不能怕炭砸死啦！也不管老君爷长短啦！我刨球不动，担球不起，这窑嘛你也兴知道：如今归了聚宝老人家啦！我才求了求乾大脑，干上这窑场挂挂秤窑底看管看管！这也不行！大三叔，如今水峪巨城零卖炭也没行情！北山里边缺炭吧，可人家又说那里是匪区，死卡住你不让来往！这不这两天下窑的也少啦！ｃàｏ＠①他妈的我看活人也真要逼死几个的！”小洋鬼一说又没个完，人们传话说是上边叫他挂秤，他才又把油扁含在嘴里，不清不楚地答应人家，又不清不楚地叹息着上窑去了，这里大三拴成才刨开了炭。
    他二人刨完了炭，就一人担了一担出去卖。他们走遍了水峪巨城，果然：小洋鬼没说瞎话！亏得是炭好，到天快黑才勉强半送半卖地换了两个钱。第二天，拴成便去阳泉找干的去了；大三没营生，只得又歇下来。
    大三歇了多半天，脑子里山南海北想了个满天飞，到半后晌，他忽然又去大窑左近转游察看去了。他这回回来，原本是拿定主意洗手不再干煤窑了的。昨天他下西窑担了担炭，却见窑里虽说没人经管，没有规章，人们乱刨乱槽塌，但炭实在是越看越强，而且他好象一眼就看进去几十里，只见一片望不到边的炭海，乌光透亮喜煞人；大三又察看了东窑，还在窑外边颠算了一阵，他觉得这窑并没有毁，只要不再胡折腾，赶早拾掇，还是能打整成一座好窑的。莫非大三真个要想拾掇这大窑么？不，他现在是起根就没这么妄想；但他心中却总活跳活跳地制不住，这也说不清是怎么个缘由。于是他记起了喜禄，觉得不去看看人家总不安心，管球它哩！黑夜，他就上喜禄家里去了。
