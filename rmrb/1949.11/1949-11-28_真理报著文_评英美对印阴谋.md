Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 26th: *Pravda* published an article by Ziyakov on Anglo-American plans for India on the 25th.

　　Ziyakov emphasized that the United States had attempted to make China its main stronghold in Asia and a link in the anti-Soviet encirclement. The great historic victory of the Chinese people was a devastating blow to this plan of American imperialism. This is why American imperialist groups have recently focused their attention on India.

　　India was chosen not only because it is the largest country in Asia after China. The main reason is that the regime established in India is in many ways similar to the anti-popular and reactionary regime that once existed in Kuomintang China.

　　Britain's plan to partition India did not bring independence to the country, because India's independence was not the purpose of this plan. Therefore, even after the partition of India, the anti-imperialist movement continued to surge in India. Despite the arrest of many trade union leaders, and despite the divisive activities of right-wing socialists, there were still 1,600 strikes last year, involving 1.3 million workers. This year, the scale of the Indian proletariat's strike movement is also very large. Since the partition of India, the peasant movement has developed particularly extensively. The peasant uprising in Hyderabad, although brutally suppressed, did not allow the Indian government's punitive forces to recover the land distributed to the peasants by the People's Committee. The Indian government was forced to announce land reform in Hyderabad to cover up its helplessness in the face of the peasant movement. Despite large-scale reprisals, the peasant movement continues to develop.

　　This reprisal is not only due to the fear of Indian capitalists and landlords of the rapid rise of the national democratic mass movement, but also one of the basic measures aimed at realizing the plan of "Wall Street" and "the City of London" to transform India into a base for Britain and the United States in the East. The invasion of India by American monopoly capital is developing according to Truman's plan of so-called "technical assistance" to backward countries. The Indian government is currently negotiating loans in the United States for this purpose. According to Truman's plan, this loan is not intended to develop industry at all, but to turn India into an agricultural and raw material appendage of the United States.

　　The increasing Anglo-American contradictions are particularly sharply raised in India. Britain was forced to endure the strengthening of American expansion in Asia because Britain colluded with the United States to participate in the imperialist conspiracy against the democratic camp. In order to help turn India into a base for the Anglo-American aggressive bloc in the East, Britain therefore encourages the United States to expand its influence in India.

　　The Nehru government is turning India into a gendarme for Britain and the United States in the East. However, recent historical lessons show that those who are willing to play the role of imperialist gendarmes will meet a tragic end.

### 真理报著文　评英美对印阴谋

  　评英美对印阴谋
    【新华社北京二十六日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报于二十五日发表齐雅科夫论英美对印度计划的文章。
    齐雅科夫着重指出：美国曾企图使中国成为美国在亚洲的主要据点和反苏包围圈的环节之一，中国人民伟大的历史性的胜利，对于美帝国主义的这一计划，是一个摧毁性的打击。这就是美国帝国主义集团近来为什么日渐把它的注意力集中在印度的原因。
    挑选印度不仅仅是由于它是亚洲仅次于中国的最大的一个国家。主要的原因乃是在印度建立的政权，在许多方面都类似在国民党中国曾经存在过的反人民的反动政权。
    英国执行分治印度的计划，并没有使这个国家获得独立，这是因为印度的独立并不是这个计划的目的。所以，即使在印度分治之后，反帝的运动仍继续在印度高涨。尽管有许多工会领袖被捕，也尽管右翼社会党人进行分裂的活动，但去年仍然发生过一千六百次罢工，参加的工人达一百三十万。今年，印度无产阶级罢工运动的规模也很广大。自从印度分治以来，农民运动发展得特别广泛。海德拉巴士邦的农民起义，虽然受到残酷的镇压。但是，印度政府的讨伐部队，并没有能够收回人民委员会分给农民的土地。印度政府被迫在海德拉巴宣布实行土地改革，以便掩盖它对农民运动的束手无策。尽管有大规模的报复，但农民运动仍然继续在发展着。
    这种报复不仅是由于印度资本家和地主对民族民主的群众运动飞速高涨的惧怕，而且也是旨在实现变印度为英美在东方的基地的“华尔街”与“伦敦城”计划的基本措施之一。美国独占资本的侵入印度，正按着杜鲁门所谓“技术援助”落后国家计划的方针发展。印度政府现在为此事在美国进行贷款谈判。按照杜鲁门的方针，这笔贷款完全不是用来发展工业，而是用来使印度变成美国的农业——原料的附属地。
    日益增加的英美矛盾，在印度特别尖锐地提到面前来了。英国被迫忍受了美国在亚洲扩张的加强，因为英国与美国串通一起参加了帝国主义对民主阵营的阴谋。英国为了帮助把印度变成英美侵略集团在东方的基地，因而鼓励美国在印度扩大势力。
    尼赫鲁政府正在把印度变成英美在东方的宪兵。但是，最近的历史教训表明，愿意充当帝国主义宪兵角色的那些人，将遭到悲惨的下场。
