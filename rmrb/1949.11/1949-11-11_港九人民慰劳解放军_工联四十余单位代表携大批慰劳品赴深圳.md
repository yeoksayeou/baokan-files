Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 10th: Hong Kong dispatch: To celebrate the liberation of Guangzhou, people from all walks of life in Hong Kong and Kowloon are continuing to enthusiastically launch a movement to express appreciation to the People's Liberation Army. Following the wave of support for the army initiated by the Hong Kong and Kowloon Federation of Trade Unions last month, workers from the Hong Kong and Kowloon General Trade Unions of Hardware, Rubber, and Gas industries have been enthusiastically engaging in labor emulation campaigns to support the army. Workers at the Chao Guang Factory launched a "one workday's pay" movement to support the army; workers at the Rubber Industry General Trade Union decided to raise funds for 3,000 pairs of rubber shoes for the army. More than 400 representatives from over forty units of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Federation of Trade Unions traveled to Shenzhen on the 30th of last month, carrying a large number of gifts to comfort the People's Liberation Army. Various schools in Hong Kong and Kowloon are actively carrying out army support movements to celebrate the liberation of Guangzhou. A gathering was held at the Jinling Restaurant on the 27th of last month, attended by more than 200 representatives from over seventy school units. At the meeting, it was decided to launch a "two dollars per person" army support movement, and eleven schools were designated to form an army support preparatory committee responsible for all fundraising matters. More than a dozen women's organizations, including the Hong Kong and Kowloon Women's Federation and the Women Workers' Committee, also held a conference at the Hotel des Nations in Hong Kong on the 29th of last month, resolving to launch a campaign to make 300 sets of cotton-padded clothing for the People's Liberation Army. In recent days, the majority of working women and housewives in the city have voluntarily participated in sewing work. At an enlarged potluck dinner, an eighty-year-old Mrs. Zhou, with a full head of white hair, used her cane and stood before the loudspeaker to denounce the atrocities of the Chiang bandits. She came to Hong Kong from Kaiping. Because she encouraged her son and young people in her village to join the People's Liberation Army, she aroused the hatred of the Kuomintang bandits, who searched for her everywhere. Now that Guangzhou has been liberated, she is preparing to return to her hometown to mobilize support for the People's Liberation Army and army support work. Hong Kong and Kowloon business people are also actively engaged in fundraising in the unprecedented wave of army support throughout the city. The Cathay Grand Theatre voluntarily held a week of charity performances, and large bookstores such as the Kowloon Nan Guo and Xuesheng Bookstore also held charity sales, donating all proceeds to support the army. Hong Kong and Kowloon art workers' groups, including woodcarving, sculpture, photography, epigraphy, painting and other personnel, recently gathered to discuss specific ways to carry out army support work. The meeting passed a resolution to hold various charity sales and exhibitions to support the army, and established a special agency to go to Shenzhen to comfort the army. This army support movement in Hong Kong and Kowloon has been unprecedentedly widespread and deeply rooted among people from all walks of life. In addition to the above-mentioned sectors and groups, apprentices, shop assistants, news vendors and general freelancers have all participated enthusiastically. Hong Kong citizen Mu Mu donated HK$10,000 and wrote to the Wah Shang报 (Wah Shang Daily), specifying that it should be forwarded to the brave People's Liberation Army who first entered Guangzhou. As of the 29th of last month, the Hong Kong Ta Kung Pao, Wen Wei Po, and Xinhua News Agency had collected more than HK$50,000 in army support donations, as well as items such as gold jewelry, watches, and fountain pens.
