An overview of the work of the North China People's Government over the past year

　　The original Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei and Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan border region governments began joint offices in May of last year. The government committee was elected by the North China Provisional People's Representative Assembly in August of last year, and the government was formally established in September, one year ago. During this year, the development of the situation in North China can be roughly divided into three stages. We have established the central tasks for each period and carried out various tasks step by step.

　　At the beginning of the establishment of this government, just as a fundamental change was taking place in the People's Liberation War, and the land reform in the entire North China region was basically completed, the central task was to vigorously support the front lines and restore and develop production. Thanks to the concerted efforts of the Party, government, army, and people, on the one hand, we successfully completed the huge supply tasks for the Beijing-Tianjin, Xuzhou, Jinzhong, and Chahar-Suiyuan campaigns; on the other hand, we vigorously organized and led the people of the entire region to restore and develop production, actively solve the remaining problems of land reform, establish a normal judicial system, stabilize social order, implement a new agricultural tax system that encourages farmers to increase production, and build water conservancy projects. Increased paddy fields, so that last autumn's harvest exceeded the previous year's output, and autumn plowing and wheat planting exceeded previous years, ensuring military and civilian food and urban supplies for the past year; clarified the policy of establishing the leadership of the state-owned economy and protecting and developing private industry and commerce that is beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood, so that industry and commerce gradually recovered and developed. At the same time, we adjusted government agencies at all levels, established a unified system, opposed bureaucracy and undisciplined phenomena, and gradually normalized government work; we focused on training cadres, and prepared for the takeover of newly liberated large cities in terms of organizational mobilization and ideological education.

　　In January of this year, Beijing and Tianjin were liberated. In February, the government moved its office to Beijing. Under the central task of continuing to support the national liberation war and reorganizing urban and rural economic relations to realize urban leadership over rural areas, we completed the supply tasks for the Anxin, Taiyuan and other battles, as well as the large-scale army's southward and westward advances; vigorously repaired highways and railways, and rapidly restored military and civilian transportation; successfully implemented the takeover of large and medium-sized cities and rapidly restored production; reorganized cultural and educational units; established national financial institutions, unified the local currency, and laid the foundation for the order of economic life. At the same time, we restored foreign trade, quickly organized the export of goods to exchange for necessities, and communicated economic relations with neighboring regions, solving the difficulties of farmers' production in the spring famine. We vigorously organized drought prevention and replanting, completed the sowing tasks of economic crops, and, in conjunction with the work of civil affairs, judicial, and public security departments, actively carried out various measures to stabilize social order, such as: improving local judicial institutions, strengthening public security work, banning secret societies, preventing bandits and special agents, appeasing refugees, transforming beggars, clearing up criminal cases, and providing disaster relief, so that the public security of newly liberated urban and rural areas was quickly restored. In addition, during this period, cultural and educational work completed the task of training a large number of cadres, and continued to prepare for the training of intellectuals going to the countryside and cadres working in new areas, rectified primary and secondary schools, and vigorously carried out urban and rural epidemic prevention work; at the same time, literary and artistic work has made new progress in rural areas and factories to adapt to the needs of political and economic construction under the new situation.

　　In May, the large army crossed the river to the south, and the takeover work of large cities such as Beijing and Tianjin was completed in order. North China began a new stage of peaceful construction. In order to reorganize urban and rural economic relations and realize the "four-sided-eight-way" policy, it was clearly pointed out that in order to develop industry, it is necessary to vigorously restore and develop agriculture at the same time, and increase the production of grain and raw material crops, in order to develop urban industry, achieve mutual assistance between urban and rural areas, and realize urban leadership over rural areas. To this end, on the one hand, urban industrial production is reorganized in a planned and step-by-step manner, gradually getting rid of dependence on imperialism, and first increasing the production of industrial products needed by farmers; on the other hand, the entire region's war service is cancelled, thrift and frugality are promoted, staff and urban intellectuals are mobilized to go to the countryside, and a large amount of loans and various materials are provided to support farmers' production. This year, disasters have continued one after another. After the drought resistance struggle, although flood prevention was vigorously carried out, excessive rainfall caused waterlogging; in addition, the river works in areas long ruled by the enemy and puppets have been in disrepair for many years, so since July, the river water has flooded, and the disaster situation is serious. Currently, production and disaster relief are being carried out, while reducing the burden on farmers, implementing thrift, and vigorously developing cooperation and sideline activities; calling on leadership to harvest autumn crops, plant wheat, and cultivate autumn crops to ensure the results of the autumn harvest and complete the wheat production task for next year. Industrial and mining enterprises have now been initially reorganized, urban and rural exchanges are gradually smooth, and prices are gradually stabilizing. In order to adapt to the development of the national situation, five provinces and regions, including Hebei, Shanxi, Pingyuan, Chahar, and Suiyuan, have been established, and Beijing and Tianjin have also been changed from military control to direct jurisdiction. At the same time, the financial and economic and public security departments were reorganized, and first transitioned to the central institutions.

　　Over the past year, in general, we have completed the tasks assigned by the North China Provisional Representative Assembly. This is mainly due to the correct leadership of the Communist Party. Experience has proved that the key to completing tasks lies in correctly implementing various policies and continuously improving work efficiency. To this end, running through our government work in various periods is rectifying government style and enforcing government discipline, especially emphasizing opposition to bureaucracy. Experience has also proved that the effective way to overcome bureaucracy is, first of all, to adhere to the system of requesting instructions and reporting, strengthen investigation and research work, carry out top-down work inspections, and expose bureaucracy to improve work responsibility; secondly, it is necessary to regularly adjust the organization, improve the office system and scientific division of labor, and at the same time strengthen business learning. Due to the continuous destruction and loss of state property, many tasks have not been promoted in a timely manner. In the continuous struggle against bureaucracy, we have found that bureaucracy is a rather serious existence in government work, and our inspection work is still very superficial. Therefore, continuing to carry out this struggle will be a central part of the work of local governments in the future.

　　华北人民政府一年来工作概述
    原晋察冀与晋冀鲁豫两边区政府，自去年五月开始联合办公，本府委员会于去年八月经华北临时人民代表大会选举出来，九月本府正式成立，至今一年。这一年的时间，华北形势的发展，大体可分为三个阶段。我们规定了各个时期的中心任务，有步骤地进行了各项工作。
    在本府成立之初，正当着人民解放战争发生根本变化，华北全区土地改革基本完成，中心任务是大力支援前线与恢复和发展生产。由于党政军民上下一致的努力，一面胜利完成了京津、徐州、晋中和察绥四个战役的巨大供应任务，一面大力组织领导了全区人民恢复与发展生产，积极地解决土地改革的遗留问题，建立正常的司法制度，稳定社会秩序，实行鼓励农民增产的新农业税制，兴修水利，增加水田，使去年秋收超过了前年产量，秋耕种麦超过往年，保证了一年来军需民食及城市供应；明确了树立国营经济领导保护发展有利于国计民生的私人工商业的政策，使工商业获得逐步地恢复和发展。同时进行了调整各级政府机构，建立统一制度，反对官僚主义和无纪律现象，使政府工作逐步走向正规；抓紧训练干部，并从组织动员上与思想教育上准备了新解放大城市的接管工作。
    本年一月，京津解放。二月本府迁京办公。在继续支援全国解放战争、改组城乡经济关系以实现城市领导乡村的中心任务下，完成了安新、太原诸战役及大军南下和西进的供应任务；大力抢修公路铁路，迅速恢复军民运输；顺利地执行了接管大中城市工作，迅速恢复生产；整编文教单位；建立全国性的金融机关，统一本位币，奠定经济生活秩序。同时恢复对外贸易，迅速组织出口货换取必需品，沟通友邻区经济关系，解决了春荒中农民生产的困难。大力组织了防旱抢种，完成经济作物的播种任务，并结合民政、司法、公安等部门工作，积极进行关于安定社会秩序的各项措施，例如：健全各地司法机构，加强公安工作，取缔会门，防范匪特，安抚流亡，改造乞丐，清理案犯，救济灾难等，使新解放城乡治安迅速地恢复。此外，文教工作在这一时期，完成了培养大批干部的任务，并继续准备下乡知识分子与新区工作干部的训练，整顿了中小学，大力进行了城乡防疫工作；同时文艺工作在农村在工厂均有新的发展，以适应新形势下政治经济建设的需要。
    五月大军南渡，京津等大城市接管工作次第完成，华北开始了和平建设的新阶段。为着改组城乡经济关系，实现“四面八方”政策，明确指出，为发展工业必须同时大力恢复与发展农业，增产粮食及原料作物，才能作到发展城市工业，才能作到城乡互助并实现城市领导农村。为此，一方面有计划有步骤地改组城市工业生产，逐渐摆脱对帝国主义的依存性，并首先增产为农民所需的工业品；一方面取消了全区战勤，提倡精简节约，动员工作人员与城市知识分子下乡，大量出贷资金及各种实物支援农民生产。今年各灾连续不断。抗旱斗争后，虽经大力防汛，但因雨量过多，积涝成灾；又以敌伪长期统治之地区，河工年久失修，故七月以来，河水泛滥，灾情严重。目前正展开生产救灾，同时减轻农民负担，实行节约，大力展开合作及副业活动的工作；号召领导秋收，种麦，秋耕，确保秋收成果并完成明年产麦任务。工矿企业，现已初步改组，城乡交流逐渐顺畅，物价亦渐趋平稳。为着适应全国形势的发展，成立了河北、山西、平原、察哈尔、绥远等五个省区，北京和天津两市亦由军管而改归直属。同时改组了财经及公安部门，首先过渡到中央机构。
    一年来，在总的方面我们完成了华北临时代表大会所给予的任务，这主要是由于有共产党的正确领导的结果。经验证明，完成任务的关键，在于正确地执行各项政策和不断地提高工作效能。为此贯穿在我们各时期政府工作中的是整顿政风、严肃政纪，特别是强调了反对官僚主义。经验又证明，克服官僚主义的有效办法，首先是坚持请示报告制度，加强调查研究工作，开展自上而下的工作检查，揭发官僚主义以提高工作责任心；其次必须经常调整组织，健全办公制度和科学分工，同时加强业务学习。由于国家财产不断地遭受破坏损失，不少工作未能及时推进，在不断与官僚主义现象作斗争中，更使我们发现在政府工作中官僚主义是相当严重的存在，而我们检查工作仍是很不深入的。因此，继续开展这一斗争，将是今后各地政府工作的中心一环。
