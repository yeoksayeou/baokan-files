Fellow young friends, tomorrow is World Youth Day. I am here to introduce to you this holiday of the youth themselves and the two global youth gatherings held in Budapest.

In late October 1945, youth representatives from sixty-three countries held a conference in London, resulting in the formation of the global youth organization – the World Federation of Democratic Youth. At this conference, a generation of young people who had made significant sacrifices in the anti-fascist war vowed to build solidarity among young people worldwide, eliminate the remnants of fascism, establish genuine friendship among all nations, maintain true and lasting peace, eradicate exploitation and poverty, and ensure that the skilled hands, intelligent minds, and youthful enthusiasm of young people would no longer be sacrificed for war. This conference lasted from October 29th to November 10th, so every year after, November 10th became World Youth Day.

Since its establishment, the World Federation of Democratic Youth has, in the past four years, led young people in striving for peace, democracy, and the defense of youth interests, and has supported the struggles of people in colonial and semi-colonial countries. In addition, the World Federation of Democratic Youth has done its utmost to support the struggles of the Chinese people and youth.

Due to the warmongering of the war-mongers, safeguarding peace has become a common and sacred cause for people all over the world, and the most central task of the World Federation of Democratic Youth. Today, this movement has formed a broad movement among young people worldwide. Young people in capitalist countries actively participate in the peace movement because they have personally experienced the suffering inflicted upon them by the Marshall Plan and the North Atlantic Treaty, and they recognize that imperialism is the root of war. Young people in socialist and people's democratic countries participate in the peace movement because they want to engage in peaceful labor to further improve the people's living standards. And the heroic struggle of young people in colonial and semi-colonial countries against imperialism strikes at the forces that could unleash war and is an important component of the movement to defend world peace. Therefore, the peace movement has become a movement of young people all over the world.

The World Federation of Democratic Youth calls on young people all over the world to actively participate in the movement to defend peace. This April, when the World Peace Congress was held, the World Federation of Democratic Youth mobilized youth organizations from various countries to participate in the conference as much as possible. Among the more than two thousand delegates to the World Peace Congress, one hundred and ninety-four were representatives of young people from various countries, accounting for one-tenth of all delegates. The World Federation of Democratic Youth requires young people from various countries to actively participate in the peace movement in their own countries, participate in the various levels of organizations of the Peace Congress in their own countries, and celebrate World Peace Day on October 2nd.

Now let's talk about two youth conferences, namely the World Youth and Student Festival and the Second Congress of the World Federation of Democratic Youth.

The World Youth and Student Festival opened in Budapest, the capital of Hungary, on August 14th this year and closed on the 28th. The purpose of this conference is to unite young people from all over the world through various activities such as culture, art, and sports to fight for lasting peace, democracy, the independence of all nations, and a better future for young people, so that the young people who come to participate in this conference will return to promote the peace movement in their own countries more actively and with more confidence.

At the World Youth and Student Festival and the Second Congress of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, the Soviet representatives received unanimous love and respect from young people of all countries. The leading role of the Soviet Union in the movement to defend world peace, its great internationalist spirit, the brilliant achievements of Soviet youth in economic construction, culture and art, and sports, and the noble qualities of the members of the Lenin Communist Youth League strengthened the world's youth's understanding of the Soviet Union, and called on young people all over the world to fight for a happy future.

On the closing day of the World Youth and Student Festival, all the democratic youth participating in the conference held a solemn swearing-in ceremony. The oath stated: "We swear to fight for the sacred goal of winning peace and happiness until victory." Yes, until victory. Young people all over the world must not only fight to win peace and happiness, but must continue to fight unremittingly until victory.

The Second Congress of the World Federation of Democratic Youth opened in Budapest on September 2nd and closed on the 8th. This congress approved the report of the World Federation of Democratic Youth's activities over the past four years, re-elected the leading bodies of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, and unanimously adopted the resolutions and declarations of the congress. In the re-elected leadership body of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, Liao Chengzhi, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Democratic Youth, was elected Vice-Chairman of the World Federation of Democratic Youth. Our All-China Federation of Democratic Youth is the second-largest member of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, with 4.42 million members. The largest member is the Soviet Youth Anti-Fascist Committee, with 13 million members.

This congress adopted the slogan of the World Federation of Democratic Youth: "Youths, unite and advance to fight for lasting peace, democracy, the national independence of all peoples, and a better future for youth." This is because striving for lasting peace and democracy is in the interests of young people all over the world; the phrase "striving for the national independence of all peoples" contains two meanings. One meaning is that all nations in every country can achieve independence, freedom, and establish genuine friendship between all nations. The other meaning is that this kind of national independence is genuine people's independence, not the kind of fake independence like that of India's Nehru. As for a better future for youth, it clearly refers to socialism and communism.

The gains of the Second Congress of the World Federation of Democratic Youth can be summarized in three aspects: First, it proved that the world's forces for peace and democracy are becoming stronger. When the World Federation of Democratic Youth was established in 1945, it only had 30 million members, but now it has more than 60 million. Second, it strengthened the friendship and unity of young people from various countries. This is reflected in the concern and support of young people from various countries for the struggles of fighting countries and oppressed nations, and the sympathy and help of young people from capitalist countries for the struggles of young people from colonial countries. An Australian youth representative, after hearing many rumors made by imperialism about people's democratic countries in the past, had some doubts. This time, after seeing the Hungarian people's desire for peace and the people's happy life in Budapest, he said that he must actively participate in the peace movement after returning home and oppose imperialism's mobilization of Australian youth to wage war against the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries. Third, it strengthened the world youth movement, showing the support of young people from various countries for the World Federation of Democratic Youth. The young people from various countries who attended the meeting unanimously pointed out that the activities of the World Federation of Democratic Youth over the past four years have shown that the principles, goals, tasks, and practical work of the World Federation of Democratic Youth are correct and consistent with the vital interests of millions of young people.

As mentioned above, the World Federation of Democratic Youth has constantly supported the struggle of the Chinese people. When the Chinese people's struggle was still in a difficult stage in the early days of the Liberation War, the World Federation of Democratic Youth called on young people all over the world to support the Chinese youth fighting for independence and freedom and send telegrams to the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference held in Moscow, requesting a peaceful resolution to the Chinese question. In addition, the World Federation of Democratic Youth has also protested the crimes of the Kuomintang reactionary government in massacring and persecuting young people many times.

The glorious victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War and the establishment of the People's Republic of China have strengthened the world's peace forces and encouraged the struggle of young people in various countries to win peace and democracy. Especially the young people in colonial and semi-colonial countries, who all take the Chinese youth as their example. Once, when Indian students were beaten by the police in a demonstration, the police said to them fiercely, "You have all learned from China!" They replied, "Yes, we are learning from New China, but you are learning from Chiang Kai-shek!" A young man from Syria was wearing a Mao Zedong badge, and a reactionary took the lead in asking him sarcastically, "Is this your leader?" He proudly replied, "This is the leader of all the oppressed people in the world."

From these two examples, we can see how the youth of the world regard the victory of China as their own victory, draw strength from the victory of China, and see the bright prospects of the future. Democratic youth all over the world cheer for the great victory of the Chinese people. This is the glory of the Chinese people and youth, and at the same time, it increases the responsibility of us Chinese youth. We must unite with the youth of the world under the leadership of the World Federation of Democratic Youth to fight for lasting peace, democracy, the independence of all nations, and a better future for youth, and support the movement of youth in colonial and semi-colonial countries to fight for independence and liberation.

    纪念世界青年日
    团结国际青年保卫和平
    ——中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会联络部副部长区棠亮十一月九日
    在北京新华广播电台播讲——
    各位青年朋友，明天是世界青年节，我在这里向大家介绍一下这个青年人自己的节日，和这次在布达佩斯开的两个全世界青年的集会。
    在一九四五年十月底，六十三个国家的青年代表在伦敦开了大会，产生了全世界青年人自己的组织——世界民主青年联盟。在这个大会上，曾经在反法西斯战争中作过重大牺牲的一代青年，宣誓要建立全世界青年的团结，消灭法西斯的残余，建立各民族的真挚友谊，保持真正的持久的和平，铲除剥削与贫困，并保证年青人的熟练的手，聪明的脑子，青年的热情，不再为战争而牺牲。这个会从十月二十九号一直开到十一月十号，所以，以后每年的十一月十号，就成了世界青年日。
    自从世界民主青年联盟成立以来，在四年当中领导青年，争取和平民主保卫青年的利益，支援殖民地半殖民地人民的斗争，此外，世界民主青年联盟，曾经尽了它最大的力量，来支援我们中国人民与青年的斗争。
    由于战争贩子的挑拨战争，保卫和平成为全世界人民的共同的神圣事业，成为世界民主青年联盟最中心的工作。到今天，这个运动已经在全世界青年中形成广泛的运动。资本主义国家的青年积极参加和平运动，因为他们亲身体验了马歇尔计划、北大西洋公约所加给他们的痛苦，认识了帝国主义是战争的祸根；社会主义与人民民主国家的青年参加和平运动，因为他们要进行和平的劳动，更进一步提高人民的生活水平，而殖民地半殖民地的青年对帝国主义的英勇斗争，打击了可能掀起战争的力量，是保卫世界和平运动的一个重要组成部分。所以说和平运动，已经成了全世界青年的运动。
    世界民主青年联盟号召全世界青年踊跃参加保卫和平运动。今年四月，世界拥护和平大会开会的时候，世界民主青年联盟动员各国青年团体尽可能参加这个大会。在世界拥护和平大会两千多个代表中间，有一百九十四个是各国青年人的代表，占了全体代表的十分之一。世界民主青年联盟要求各国青年积极参加本国的和平运动，参加本国拥护和平大会的各级组织，并且庆祝十月二号的世界和平日。
    下面再谈一谈两个青年人的大会，这就是世界青年和学生联欢大会和世界民主青年联盟第二次代表大会。
    世界青年和学生联欢大会，今年八月十四号在匈牙利首都布达佩斯开幕，到二十八号闭幕。这个会的目的是要通过文化艺术和体育等各种活动，团结全世界青年为争取持久和平、民主、各民族的独立和青年的美好将来而斗争，使得来参加这次大会的青年，回去以后更积极而充满信心的去推进本国的和平运动。
    在世界青年和学生联欢大会和世界民主青年第二次代表大会上，苏联的代表受到了各国青年一致的热爱与尊敬。苏联在保卫世界和平运动中所起的领导作用，它的伟大的国际主义精神，苏联青年在经济建设，文化艺术和体育等方面的光辉成就，以及列宁共产主义青年团团员的高贵品质，加强了世界青年对苏联的认识，召唤着全世界青年去为幸福的将来而斗争。
    在世界青年和学生联欢大会闭幕的那天，全体参加大会的民主青年举行庄严的宣誓典礼。宣誓词中说到：“我们誓为争取和平和幸福的神圣目的而斗争，直到胜利为止。”是的，直到胜利为止。全世界的青年，不但要为争取和平幸福而斗争，而且要不松懈地一直斗争到胜利为止。
    世界民主青年第二次代表大会，九月二号在布达佩斯开幕，八号闭幕。这次大会批准了四年来世界青联活动的报告，改选了世界青联的领导机构，一致通过了大会的决议与宣言。在改选以后的世界青联领导机构里面，中华全国民主青年联合总会主席廖承志当选为世界青联的副主席。我们的中华全国民主青年联合总会，在世界青联中间是第二个大会员，拥有会员四百四十二万人。最大的会员是苏联青年反法西斯委员会，有会员一千三百万人。
    这次大会通过了世界青联的口号，就是：“青年们团结起来，前进，为争取持久和平民主，各国人民的民族的独立和青年更美好的将来而斗争。”这是因为争取持久和平与民主符合全世界青年的利益；争取各国人民的民族独立这句话包含两个意思，一个意思是每个国家里各个民族都能获得独立，自由，建立各民族间真正的友谊；另一个意思是这种民族独立是真正的人民的独立，而不是印度尼赫鲁式的那种假独立；对于青年更美好的将来，很明显的指的就是社会主义、共产主义。
    世界民主青年第二次代表大会的收获，总起来可以分三方面来说：第一，证明了世界和平民主力量的更加强大，一九四五年世界青联成立的时候，只有三千万会员，现在已经有六千多万了。第二，加强了各国青年的友爱团结，这表现在各国青年对战斗国家与被压迫民族的斗争的关心与支持，资本主义国家青年对殖民地国家青年斗争的同情和帮助。一个澳大利亚的青年代表，过去听了帝国主义对人民民主国家所造的许多谣言后，有些半信半疑，这次到布达佩斯看到了匈牙利人民对和平的热望，人民幸福的生活，就表示回国以后一定要积极参加和平运动，反对帝国主义动员澳大利亚的青年去进行反对苏联和人民民主国家的战争。第三，加强了世界青年运动，表现了各国青年对世界青联的拥护，到会的各国青年一致指出世界青联四年来的活动显示了世界青联的原则、目标、任务和实际工作是正确的，是和千百万青年的切身利益相符合的。
    上面已经说过，世界青联曾经不断的支援中国人民的斗争，当解放战争初期，中国人民斗争还处在艰苦阶段的时候，世界青联曾经号召全世界青年支援为独立自由而进行斗争的中国青年打电报给在莫斯科举行的四国外长会议，要求和平解决中国问题。此外，世界青联还好多次抗议国民党反动政府屠杀迫害青年的罪行。
    中国人民解放战争的辉煌胜利和中华人民共和国的成立，加强了世界和平力量，鼓舞了各国青年争取和平民主的斗争。尤其是殖民地半殖民地的青年，都是拿中国青年当做他们的榜样的。有一次，印度学生在示威运动中被警察殴打，警察凶狠狠地对他们说：“你们都学了中国了！”他们回答说：“是的，我们是在学新中国，你们学的却是蒋介石！”叙利亚一个青年，带着一个毛泽东徽章，一个反动分子带头讽刺的口气问他：“这是你的领袖吗？”他骄傲的回答：“这是世界上所有被压迫人的领袖。”
    由这两个例子，可以看出世界青年，是怎样地把中国的胜利看作自己的胜利，从中国的胜利吸取战斗的力量，看到未来光明的远景。全世界民主青年都欢呼中国人民的伟大胜利，这是中国人民和青年的光荣，同时也就加重了我们中国青年的责任。我们要在世界青联领导下和全世界青年团结起来，为争取持久和平、民主、各民族的独立及青年的美好将来而斗争，并且支援殖民地半殖民地国家青年争取独立解放的运动。
