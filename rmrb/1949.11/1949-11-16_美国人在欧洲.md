　　Americans in Europe
    By K. Luzhikov, Translated by Li Wenhai
    August in London this year was beautiful. Clear, cool weather, light clouds, and thin morning mists had changed the city's gray monotony into the rose colors of landscapes painted by British artists.
    On such a day, we were standing at the corner of Victoria Street, opposite Westminster Abbey, waiting to cross the road, when two Americans stopped beside us. From the way they spoke, from their blue-gray trousers, orange leather shoes, and shiny ties printed with horses' heads, horseshoes, and dogs jumping through hoops, it was easy to recognize them as Americans. A glimpse of them reminded us of a popular London joke. It was about two Americans who happened to be standing in front of Westminster Abbey one day. (Westminster Abbey is a famous British abbey - translator).
    "That thing looks kinda pretty, eh?" one said, pointing to Westminster Abbey.
    "Not bad," the other said. "When the Brits go completely bankrupt, we'll trade them something for this and ship it back to the States."
    Of course, we didn't want to associate this story with the two young Americans we met at the corner of Victoria Street. But it must be pointed out that Londoners have recently had ample opportunity to intimately experience the tastes and habits of their transatlantic guests, and this joke is, of course, not accidental.
    In recent years, we have witnessed an unprecedented expansion of American consciousness in Europe. Along with American canned pork and egg powder, a flood of pseudo-scientific ideas, corrupt and reactionary literature, obscene and bandit films, etc., has spread to Western countries. This psychological attack has come along with anti-Soviet movements and war hysteria. American "ideological aggression" is particularly obvious in Britain, where it is even more effortless due to the common language.
    The main blow is primarily in literature. London's bookstores are practically branches of American publishing companies.
    We happened to drop by a bookstore on "Tea Road" in London's book industry center. There weren't many customers, so we took the opportunity to talk to the clerk. He seemed visibly happy when we said we were interested in British writers. When we asked him which books were most in demand at the moment, he pointed us to the bestseller display. It was full of books by American authors, all with the usual shiny leather covers and stimulating titles. The most prominently displayed was Kathleen Winsor's "Forever Amber," followed by "Date Tonight," "Mr. Adam," "Hot Kisses," "Secret of Stimulants," "Art of Love," "Philosophy of Life," and Upton Sinclair's voluminous narrative poems.
    The United States ships 25 million gold dollars worth of books to Britain every year; five times the pre-war amount. Eighty percent of the content of British magazines is excerpts from overseas editions of novels.
    American publications are not just limited to the obscene and detective genres. The main theme now is warmongering. This theme appears repeatedly in various forms in short stories and novels, in essays and prose, anecdotes and poems. We saw some such books, including the provocative "Flaming World: The US-Soviet War in 1950," placed in the study of our host, Mr. Cran, who had no warmongering tendencies and, because his house hadn't been destroyed by a German bomb, was very grateful to fate; he was most interested in grain prices and dog races.
    "I have to buy these books," he sighed, "four books cost three pounds and six shillings. I'll never be able to read all these books in my lifetime. I just started reading one, and I was plagued by nightmares all night, terrible nightmares, and I woke up the next day feeling like I was sick. But you know, guests come to visit occasionally, and everyone has this kind of book now. If you don't put a few on the bookshelf, it's really embarrassing."
    The serious fear of American literary invasion has even been raised in the British Parliament. Labor MP Skeffington-Lodge declared:
    "It (referring to American literature - translator) is a veritable Niagara of tripe, concealing the real America behind a facade of intricate sentimentality, cheap cynicism, and tap-like recurrence; those stories are mostly set against a background of luxury, and the motives of the heroes and heroines are always the same kind of screaming selfishness. The hero is often a rich man's son, a robber-like fellow, and the heroine is often willing to do anything to take a rich man as the biggest goal in her life."
    This statement shocked the British Parliament. However, eyewitnesses confirm that several MPs took this opportunity to jot down some American novels with even more fragrant titles.
    Because of the deteriorating economic situation, Britain is increasingly dependent on the United States, so few people talk about resisting the expansion of consciousness that has crossed the ocean.
    In fact, the entertainment sections of British daily newspapers are gradually becoming Americanized. This is especially true in the film industry, where British films are practically manipulated by American bosses. British films are losing their national characteristics. Some British films, such as "Night Beat" or "Easy Money," are completely imitating Hollywood. The film "The Blue Lagoon," which was shown at the Venice Film Festival, showed the extent to which British films have become Americanized.
    Britain's "open door" policy towards American films is forcing the British film industry to reduce production. Thirty percent of Britain's top film experts - members of the Film Association and Technicians Alliance - have been laid off because the studios can no longer accommodate them.
    We spoke with a film director, the producer of several successful films before the war, who also mentioned the film "Oliver Twist." What's noteworthy about this film is that, apart from the empty plot, it has nothing in common with Dickens's original work, and it also has an anti-Semitic tendency. This film is based on the story of Oliver being kidnapped by a gang of thieves. The Hollywood tricks were all put into this play, murder, chases, dazzling high-rise jumps, etc. We were surprised that a British producer would take such a British classic as the basis for a lower-grade detective film, and he replied that it was necessary to take into account "social tastes." The argument is this:
    "Film has to have its plans; to entice people to see it. The market is flooded with American films, and we have to change the taste of our films to make them like American ones. This is singing British songs in American tunes."
    This situation is not unique to Britain. A French journalist stationed in London told us that French writers are inventing American pen names in order to create the impression that their novels are translated from American books. French literature has been hit harder by the wave of American literary translations than British literature. These translations amounted to nearly a thousand in 1948 alone. Only French writers who imitate Americans can compete with those "overseas editions" (American). Paris bookstores are simply piles of cheap waste. Valuable places are used to display the works of existentialist Boris Vian. "I Spit on Your Graves", "All Dead Skin is the Same", etc. Just these titles are enough to illustrate their essence. Of the new books on the Paris market, twenty-five out of a hundred are openly obscene; thirty are of the so-called "black literature" category, that is, they are full of death, despair, and depression. At the same time, one-third of all these novels are translated from American. The startling spiritual poverty of the characters and the unrestrained propaganda of the "American way of life," usually presented as a synthesis of wild drunkenness, the debauchery of gilded youths, and the lynchings of evil parties, are common to these Americanized literary wastes.
    In France, foreign tourists are sure to notice that bookstores are filled with French versions of various American magazines. People in Paris say that each issue of these magazines is "an attempt to Americanize the minds of the French people."
    Progressive French journalists and writers are deeply pained by this. They say sadly: "The air in Paris is thick with the smoke of American cigarettes and the stench of American literature, and the streets of Paris are filled with people from the US military headquarters in Fontainebleau...."
    American propaganda focuses particularly on seizing European youth. Not long ago, a strange thing happened: when awards were given to outstanding students at the Lycée Henri IV, each student was given several copies of the American "Omnibook," a soft magazine, sent by the American Bridge Association to "give to the students with the best English." This was approved by the French Minister of Education and the Chief Inspector.
    "This insulting method, encouraged by the French authorities, of forcing French children to gnaw on the scraps of American 'culture,' is terrible," wrote the magazine Pensée.
    The French film industry has been completely suffocated by Hollywood. Newspapers say it is "on the verge of disaster" and declare that it has practically "run out of breath." Just a glance at the newspapers shows how American films, sometimes mostly old ones, fill the French market. One of the points in the notorious Blum-Byrnes agreement stipulates that France must show American films for nine weeks out of thirteen weeks. Hollywood floods the French film market with old films at dumping prices, driving out French films that cannot compete. As a result, American films are not only shown during the nine weeks stipulated but are often shown regularly. Most French film studios have no work to do. The French film industry has laid off a large number of personnel, and Hollywood has taken the opportunity to transport famous French producers and skilled actors and actresses. Famous directors such as René Clair and Jean Renoir have all gone to the United States.
    These are the clear evidence of American aggression in Western Europe. The tycoons of Wall Street are not only interfering in the economies of Western European countries, but also in their cultures. The ruling groups in these countries are sacrificing their national cultures, taking them in exchange for exaggerated streams of reactionary propaganda. These things poison the people's spirits, destroying all their human emotions, and turning Europeans into ignorant, docile slaves of American imperialism.

　　美国人在欧洲
    Ｋ·鲁日柯夫著  李文海译
    今年伦敦的八月是漂亮的。晴朗、凉爽的天气，轻轻的云块和薄薄的晨雾已把这都市的灰色老调子改了样，成为英国艺术家们所画的风景那种玫瑰色彩。
    在这样的一天，我们站在西明寺对过维多利亚街的一角，等着要越过马路，有两个美国人在我们身边站住。从他们说话的样子，从他们穿的蓝灰色裤子，橙色皮鞋，以及发亮的印着马头、马蹄和狗跳环等等花色的领带等，都很容易认出他们是美国人。一瞥见他们，我们就想起一段伦敦流行的笑话。那是说的有两个美国人，有一天偶然站在西明寺前面。（Ｗｅｓｔｍｉｎｉｓｔｅｒ　Ａｂｂｅу）（西明寺是英国著名大修道院—译者）。
    “那玩意儿似乎有点美呀，嗳？”其中一个指着西明寺说。
    “真不坏。”另外那一个说。“等英国人彻底破了产的时候，咱们就拿些什么跟他们把这东西换来，给运回咱合众国去。”
    当然，我们并非要拿这故事连到在维多利亚街路角所遇的那两个美国青年身上。可是必须指出，伦敦人近来是有充分机会去亲切地领教了他们的大西洋彼岸的贵客们的口味和习性，而这个笑话，当然也就不是偶然的了。
    近几年来，我们已看到了美国意识在欧洲那样空前地扩张。伴随着美国的罐头猪肉和鸡蛋粉，还有一股伪科学观念，腐滥反动文学，淫猥与贼匪的电影片子等的洪水，泛滥到西方各国。这种心理的攻击是跟反苏运动及战争的歇斯底里一块来的。美国的“意识侵略”在英国是尤其明显易见，在这里这种侵略由于语文的相同，更是相当省劲。
    最主要的打击，首先是在文学方面。伦敦的书店简直就象是美国出版的公司支店。
    我们曾经偶然的顺便到伦敦书业中心的“茶的路”上一家书店里看看。店里顾客不多，我们借此机会跟店伙计谈谈。当我们说我们对英国作家感到兴趣的时候，他显然的很快活起来。当我们问他目前以那些书最渴市的时候，他指着畅销书陈列柜给我们看。那上面全是美国作者写的，而且都有通常见的那种闪光的皮面和富有刺激性的书名，最显著夺目的是卡德林·温莎著的“除却巫山不是云”（Ｆｏｒ　Ｅｖｅｒ　Ａｍｂｅｒ）（中国有两种译本，一是香港唐哲夫译的，一是傅东华译的，他译名“虎魄”——译者注），其次是“今夕佳期”（Ｄａｔｅ　Ｔｏｎｉｇｈｔ），“亚当先生”，“妙吻”，“兴奋剂的秘密”，“爱情艺术”，“处世哲学”，及ｕ·辛克莱的巨卷叙事诗。
    美国每年往英国运去二千五百万金圆的书籍；是战前的五倍。英国杂志百分之八十的篇幅是摘载海外版本的小说的。
    美国出的读物中，并非光只是淫猥与侦探的一格。现在的主调是必战论。这一个主题以各种各样姿态在短篇故事及小说中，在论文及散文中，轶事与诗歌中，反复出现。我们看到了一些这样的书，其中有那刺激性的“火焰世界。一九五○年的美苏之战”，摆在我们的客寓主人克汉先生书房里。克汉先生是并无好战倾向的，而且因为他屋子没给一颗德国炸弹轰毁，他还很感激命运呢，他最感兴趣的是粮食价格和跑狗赛。
    “我不得不买这些书呀，”他叹口气道，“四本要三磅六先令。我这辈子也看不了这些书。我刚开始看一本，当晚整夜被恶梦缠绕着，可怕的梦魔呀，第二天起来简直象病了一场。可是你知道，客人偶然来过访，因为现在每人都有这一类的书。你不弄几本放在书架上，怪寒蠢的呀。”
    对于美国文学侵入的严重忧惧，甚至曾在英议会上提出过。工党议员斯克芬顿—罗治宣称：
    “它（指美国文学—译者）是真正的扯淡的大瀑布，把真正的美国，隐藏在一个错综的伤感，廉价犬儒主义与水龙头似的又来又往的性质的表面之后，那些故事多半是以奢侈为背景，里面的英雄与女英雄们的动机老是不变的一种狂叫自私自利。英雄往往是个富家子，强盗式的汉子，而女英雄呢，往往是不惜任何代价，去取一个有钱汉为一生最大目标的。”
    这一番话使英议会为之一震。然而目击者却确言有几位议员正好借此机会又记下了一些题名更香的美国小说。
    因为经济情况恶化，不列颠越来越要依靠美国，所以很少有人谈及抵抗远渡重洋而来的意识的扩张了。
    事实上，英国日报的玩艺栏也渐渐美国化了。这在电影方面尤其如此，英国电影实际上给美国老板们操纵着。英国电影片正在丧失其本国特性。有些英国片子如“夜鼓”或“难得芳草赠美人”等是完全模仿好莱坞的东西。在威尼斯赛会上放映的“蓝湖”一片，显示了英国电影的美国化到了什么样程度。
    英国对美国电影的“门户开放”政策，正迫使英国电影业减缩生产。百分之三十的英国第一流电影专家——电影协会及技师联盟的会员们——已经失业了，厂里已容不了他们。
    我们同一位电影导演，战前几部成功的片子的制片家谈话中，也提到影片“贼史”（Ｏｅｌｖｅｒ　Ｔｗｉｓｔ）。关于这片子的值得注意的一点是，除了空洞的情节以外，没有半点与狄更斯原作有共同之处，而且它还有一种排犹倾向。这片子是根据奥列佛被贼党绑票的故事。把好莱坞的把戏一古鲁儿放到这戏里面去，凶杀、追逐、眩目的高楼跃下等等。我们觉得奇怪，何以英国制片家竟会从这么一本英国古典文学作品取作一部下级侦探片，他回答说是要顾及“社会口味”。论调是这样的：
    “电影片子要有它的打算；要引诱人们去看它。市场上泛滥着美国片子，我们非得把我们的片子换换口味，使它们象美国造。这就是用美国调子来唱英国曲子。”
    这种情形不但只是于英国为然的。驻伦敦的一位法国记者告诉我们，法国作家们正在发明美式笔名，目的在造成一种印象，使人觉得他们的小说是译自美国书的。法国文学已被美国文学译作的浪潮打击得比英国还要严重。这些译作仅在一九四八年就几达一千种。只有模仿美国人的法国作家还能跟那些“海外版”（美国）竞争一下。巴黎的书店简直就是贱价废物堆。名贵的地方要来陈列生存主义者波利斯维安的作品。“我要为你的坟墓”、“死人的皮肤都是一样的”等等。就这些题名就够说明它们的本质了。巴黎市上的新书，一百本里面有二十五本是公然淫猥的；有三十本是所谓的“黑色文学”那一类的，那就是说它们净写的是死亡、绝望和沮丧。同时，所有这些个小说，有三分之一是翻译美国的。人物的惊人的精神贫窘与及“美国生活方式”的不羁宣传，通常呈现为狂醉放荡的综合，镀金少爷们的放荡与邪党的私刑拷打，就是这些美国化文学废物所共同的东西。
    在法国，外国游客一定会注意到书店里充塞着各种美国杂志的法文版。巴黎的人们说，这些杂志的每一期都是“一个要美国化法国人心的企图。”
    进步的法国新闻记者及作家，对这方面极感痛苦。他们忧伤地说：“巴黎空气里有浓重的美国香烟烟雾和美国文学的臭气，巴黎街道上拥挤着芳坦尼伯鲁美军总部来的人了……。”
    美国的宣传，特别着重在攫取欧洲青年。不久以前，发生了下面的一件古怪事：在“享利第四里塞学校”（Ｌｙｃｅｅ　Ｈｅｎｒｉ　ＩＶ）（里塞学校Ｌｙｔｃｅｅ是法国第二级小学——译者。）给优等生发奖时，每人发好几本美国的“杂志文摘”（Ｏｍｎｉｂｏｏｋ），这是一本软性杂志，由美国桥牌总会送来以“赠给英文最好的学生。”这是经过法国教育部长及总视学长的批准的。
    “这种由法国当局鼓励的，迫使法兰西儿童去啃美国‘文化’余屑的侮辱办法，是可怕的。”潘塞杂志写道。
    法国电影业已完全被好莱坞窒息住了。报纸说这是“到了灾难边缘”，并宣称它已经实际上“断了气”。只要浏览一下报纸就可以看到美国片子，有时还大半是旧片子，是怎样地填饱了法国市场。臭名昭彰的勃鲁姆——贝尔纳斯协定中有一点是订好了法国在十三周中要有九周放映美国片子。好莱坞把旧片子以倾销低价涌进法国电影市场，把无法抗衡的法国片子赶出市场。结果，美国片子不但在规定的九周中放映而且是经常的放映了。大部分法国电影制片厂没工可作。法国电影工业大批解雇人员，借此机会好莱坞运去了法国著名制片家和熟练的男女演员。著名的导演雷耐·克来雷、约翰·雷诺瓦等人都上美国去了。
    这些就是美国侵略西欧的明证。华尔街的大亨们不但在经济上，而且还在文化上染指西欧各国，这些国家的统治集团正在牺牲其本国文化，拿去交易反动宣传的夸张之流，这些东西毒害人民的精神，要毁坏他们的一切人的情感，要把欧洲人变成为愚昧无知的驯服的美帝国主义的奴隶。
