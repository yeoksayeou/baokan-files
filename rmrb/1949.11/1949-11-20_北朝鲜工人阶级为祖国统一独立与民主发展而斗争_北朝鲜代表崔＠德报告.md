Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 19th. Choi @ Deok, Chairman of the Central Committee of the General Federation of Trade Unions of North Korea, delivered a report this afternoon at the Asian-Australasian Trade Union Conference entitled "The North Korean Working Class Struggles for National Reunification, Independence, and Democratic Development." The following is a summary of the report:

	During the 36 long years of Japanese imperialist rule, the Korean people suffered the most cruel and dark barbaric oppression and exploitation. The lives of the Korean working class and working people were in an unspeakable tragic situation. Japanese imperialism controlled all factories and enterprises in Korea, harshly exploiting the Korean working class. However, the Korean working class, in order to resist such exploitation and inhuman working conditions, and to fight for national independence and their own rights, constantly launched unyielding struggles.

	Since the "March 1st" Movement in 1919, in which the entire Korean people resisted Japanese imperialist rule, Korea has had a trade union movement that defends the interests of the working class. In 1923, there was the "May 1st" struggle, and in April 1925, the vanguard of the Korean working class—the Korean Communist Party—was finally organized. From then on, the workers stood at the forefront of the anti-Japanese national liberation struggle. Later, especially due to the anti-Japanese armed struggle led by the Korean national hero, General Kim Il-sung, the Korean workers' movement was greatly encouraged. Under the most brutal suppression of Japanese imperialism, from January to August 1940, there were as many as 623 workers' strikes, with the participation of more than 49,000 workers. This fact clearly proves how the Korean working class expanded the Korean workers' movement under the most stringent Japanese imperialist repression.

	Choi @ Deok said: After nearly half a century of suffering under the rule of the vicious Japanese imperialism, the Korean people and their working class were liberated thanks to the assistance of the heroic Soviet army. Only then did they fully possess the conditions for building an independent and democratic country. Only when the heroic Soviet army participated in the war against Japan and achieved victory, did the Korean nation get rid of the shackles of exploitation, persecution, and slaughter.

	The great Soviet army, respecting and supporting the independence and freedom of small and weak nations, has been working for the reunification, independence, and democracy of Korea since its entry into northern Korea. They guaranteed that the Korean people could build their liberated motherland in accordance with their own will.

	However, less than a month after the heroic Soviet army defeated Japanese imperialism, the American imperialists who landed in South Korea still inherited the ruling structure of the Japanese imperialist Governor-General's Office, seized the Japanese regime in their own hands, and did not give any political rights and freedom to the liberated Korean people, and suppressed and dissolved the People's Committees organized in various places due to the people's political creativity.

	Choi @ Deok said: Since the entry of the US imperialist army into South Korea, Korea has been divided into North and South and moved in opposite directions. In the northern half of Korea, where the heroic Soviet army was stationed, the People's Committees established by the Korean people have achieved genuine development. The People's Committees implemented various democratic reforms such as land reform, nationalization of important industries, labor laws, and laws on equal rights for men and women. As a result, the plans for the Korean national economy and the revival of the people's economy were successfully implemented, so that the Korean people truly became the masters of their own motherland.

	After the implementation of the Law on the Nationalization of Important Industries on August 10, 1946, the economy of North Korea began to develop rapidly. The total industrial production in 1947 increased by 154% compared with 1946, and in 1948 it increased by 260% compared with 1946. At the same time, labor efficiency in 1948 also increased by 235.8% compared with 1946.

	Due to the implementation of the labor law, the working conditions of workers and staff in North Korea have been fundamentally improved, and their material and cultural living standards have been rapidly raised. During the rule of Japanese imperialism, there were 1,372 primary and secondary schools in North Korea, but only 115 middle and technical schools, with a total of only 910,000 students. But at the end of 1948, the number of specialized technical schools alone had increased by 85, with a total of about 31,000 students. In the era of Japanese imperialist rule, there was not even a single university in North Korea, but now 15 new universities have been established, with more than 13,000 students.

	After Japanese imperialism was eliminated in Korea, North Korea fully guaranteed freedom of speech, assembly, publication, and association. Under such conditions, the trade unions legally began their movement. On November 30, 1945, the unified mass organization of workers and staff in North Korea—the General Federation of Trade Unions of North Korea—was organized on the basis of three industrial leagues. The General Federation of Trade Unions had 130,000 members when it was established, but by 1947 it had increased to 540,000 members. In the past, during the rule of Japanese imperialism, the role and task of the Korean General Federation of Trade Unions was to oppose Japanese imperialism and the reactionary national bourgeoisie, but after liberation, the trade unions in North Korea became assistants and supporters of national sovereignty, and under the leadership of the vanguard of the working class—the Workers' Party—they promoted or practiced various democratic reforms and all constructions. The trade unions are fighting to strengthen the people's sovereignty and consolidate the economic struggle for the construction of a completely autonomous and independent country, and are pouring all their strength into motivating and inspiring workers, engineers, and staff.

	While advocating the strengthening of labor, the trade unions also correctly implement the labor law, continuously improve labor conditions, correctly resolve labor wages, and constantly strive to improve the workers' class consciousness and internationalist thinking and to continuously improve the material and cultural level of workers and staff.

	Due to the improvement of workers' working conditions, the production enterprises in northern Korea have achieved great development. At the end of 1947, industrial machinery that could not be produced even during the rule of Japanese imperialism was manufactured by the Korean workers themselves.

	Choi @ Deok pointed out that in South Korea, which is occupied by the American imperialist army, it is going in the completely opposite direction. Since occupying South Korea, the US imperialists have suppressed the Korean people's own organization—the People's Committee. The US imperialists have twice undermined the decision of the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference in December 1945, refused the Soviet representative's proposal for the simultaneous withdrawal of Soviet and US troops, and illegally submitted the Korean issue to the UN General Assembly, using their own election machine to fabricate the so-called "UN Korea Commission." The US imperialists manipulated this so-called "UN Korea Commission" to deceive and violently interfere in the internal affairs of our country, and are still interfering. They suppressed and closed 17 major newspaper offices and three major news agencies in the three years from 1946 to 1948, and the Syngman Rhee puppet government has suppressed and blocked 59 kinds of newspapers and magazines in just one year since its establishment.

	In terms of economy, the US imperialists destroyed all industries in South Korea and completely turned it into their own commodity market.

	Due to the aggressive policy of the US imperialists and the traitorous and nation-destroying policy of the Syngman Rhee party, the people of South Korea are groaning in disaster and can no longer tolerate it. Therefore, representatives of more than 50 political parties and social groups in North and South Korea, representing the vast majority of the Korean people, convened the North-South Korea Political Parties and Social Organizations Liaison Conference in April 1948 to establish a more powerful national salvation strategy. In June 1948, the North-South Korea Political Parties and Social Organizations Leaders Association was convened again, and it was decided to exclude any foreign interference, to unify the motherland with the power of the Korean people themselves, and to implement the general election of North Korea.

	Based on this decision, on August 25, 1948, the historically significant election of deputies to the Korean Supreme People's Assembly was completed.

　　北朝鲜工人阶级为祖国统一独立与民主发展而斗争
    北朝鲜代表崔＠德报告
    【新华社北京十九日电】北朝鲜职业总同盟中央委员会委员长崔＠德，今日下午在亚澳工会会议上以“北朝鲜工人阶级为祖国统一独立与民主发展而斗争”为题作了报告。报告内容摘要如下：  　
　朝鲜民族在日本帝国主义三十六年的长期统治期间，曾遭受到最惨酷最黑暗的野蛮压迫与剥削，朝鲜工人阶级与劳动人民的生活，处于不可言喻的悲惨境况。日本帝国主义掌握了朝鲜所有的工厂与企业，苛刻地剥削朝鲜工人阶级。但朝鲜工人阶级为反抗这样的剥削与非人的劳动条件，为争取祖国的独立与自己的权利，曾不断地展开了不屈不挠的斗争。
    从一九一九年全体朝鲜人民进行了反抗日本帝国主义统治的“三一”运动以后，朝鲜有了拥护工人阶级利益的职工运动。在一九二三年有了“五一”斗争，一九二五年四月终于组织了朝鲜工人阶级的先锋队—朝鲜共产党。从此以后工人们就站在反日民族解放斗争的最前线。到后来，尤其是由于朝鲜民族英雄—金日成将军领导的抗日武装斗争，更大大鼓舞了朝鲜的工人运动。在日本帝国主义最残酷的弹压下，一九四○年一月至八月期间，工人罢工运动竟达六百二十三次，参加的工人有四万九千余人。这事实很清楚地证明朝鲜工人阶级在最苛刻的日本帝国主义弹压下如何扩大了朝鲜工人运动。
    崔＠德说：经过了将近半世纪的长久时间，呻吟在恶毒的日本帝国主义统治下的朝鲜人民与其工人阶级，由于英勇的苏联军队的援助才获得了解放。从这时他们才充分地具有了建设自主的民主国家的条件。唯有英勇的苏联军队参加对日作战并取得了胜利，朝鲜民族才摆脱了剥削、迫害和杀戮的桎梏。
    尊重和拥护弱小民族的独立与自由的伟大苏联军队，由进驻朝鲜北部时起，即为着朝鲜的统一、独立与民主而努力，他们保障了朝鲜人民能够依照自己的意旨建设解放后的自己祖国之一切可能性。
    但是，英勇的苏联军队击溃了日本帝国主义后，不到一个月的期间在南朝鲜登陆的美帝国主义者，仍然继承日本帝国主义总督府的统治机构，将日帝的政权掌握在自己手里，对于解放的朝鲜人民，丝毫不给任何的政治权利和自由，并弹压和解散了由于人民们政治的创造力在各地所组织的人民委员会
    崔＠德说：美帝国主义军队进驻南朝鲜以来，朝鲜便分裂为南北两部并各自走向相反的方向。英勇的苏联军队进驻的朝鲜北半部，朝鲜人民创立的人民委员会得到了真正的发展。人民委员会实施了土地改革、重要的产业国有化、劳动法令及男女平等权法令等各种民主改革。由此，有成绩地实施了朝鲜民族经济及复兴人民经济的计划，这样朝鲜人民真正成为自己祖国的主人了。
    一九四六年八月十日实施了重要产业国有化法令后，北朝鲜的经济开始了迅速的发展。一九四七年产业总生产量较一九四六年提高了百分之一百五十四，一九四八年较一九四六年提高了百分之二百六十，同时劳动效率在一九四八年较一九四六年也提高了百分之二百三十五点八。
    由于劳动法令的实施，根本改善了北朝鲜的工人、职员们的劳动条件，并迅速提高了他们的物质文化生活的水平。在日本帝国主义统治时期，北朝鲜的学校中小学有一千三百七十二所，中学及技术学校仅不过一百一十五所，学生总数不过九十一万人。可是在一九四八年末，仅仅各种专门技术学校就增加了八十五所，学生总数约有三万一千人。日本帝国主义统治时代北朝鲜连一个大学都没有，但现在新建立了十五个大学，有一万三千多个学生。
    日本帝国主义在朝鲜被消灭后，北朝鲜完全保障了言论、集会、出版、结社的自由，在这样条件下职业同盟合法地开始了自己的运动。一九四五年十一月三十日在三个产业同盟的基础上，组织了北朝鲜工人和职员的统一的群众组织——北朝鲜职业总同盟。职业总同盟在成立时有十三万盟员，但到一九四七年就增加到了五十四万盟员。过去在日本帝国主义统治时代，朝鲜职业总同盟的作用和任务是反对日本帝国主义和反动的民族资产阶级，但是解放后在北朝鲜的职业同盟则成为了国家主权的协助者及支持者，并在劳动阶级的先锋队——劳动党的领导下，提倡或实践各种民主改革与一切建设。职业同盟是为着强化人民主权及巩固完全自主、独立国家建设的经济斗争，为推动鼓舞工人、工程师、职员而倾注自己的一切力量。
    职业同盟与提倡强化劳动的同时，还正确地实施了劳动法令，不断地改善劳动条件，正确的解决劳动工资，而且为提高工人阶级觉悟及国际主义思想和不断的为提高工人职员的物质文化水平而斗争。
    由于工人劳动条件的改善，朝鲜北部的生产事业获得了巨大的发展。在一九四七年末，即在日本帝国主义统治时代也不能生产的工业机械，已由朝鲜工人自己制造出来。
    崔＠德指出在美国帝国主义军队占领的朝鲜南部，则完全走着相反的道路。美帝国主义者自占据朝鲜南部以来，弹压了朝鲜人民自己的组织——人民委员会。美帝国主义者曾前后两次破坏了一九四五年十二月莫斯科三外长会议的决定，拒绝苏联代表提议的苏美两国军队同时撤退；将朝鲜问题非法地提交到联合国大会，利用自己的选举机器，捏造了所谓“联大朝鲜委员团”。美帝国主义操纵这所谓“联大朝鲜委员团”，欺骗和乱暴地干涉我们祖国的内政，现在还在干涉中。它们在一九四六年至一九四八年三年间，弹压和封闭了十七个大报馆和三个大通讯社，而且李承晚傀儡政府成立以来不过一年中，弹压封锁了五十九种报纸和杂志。
    在经济方面，美帝国主义者破坏了南朝鲜的全部产业，完全变成为自己的商品市场。
    由于美帝国主义者的侵略政策与李承晚卖国党徒们的亡国灭族政策，南朝鲜人民在灾祸里呻吟着再不能容忍下去。于是代表朝鲜人民绝大多数的南北朝鲜五十余个政党社会团体代表，在一九四八年四月召开了南北朝鲜政党社会团体联系会议，树立了更有力的救国对策。一九四八年六月又召集了南北朝鲜政党社会团体指导者协会，决定排除任何外国的干涉，以朝鲜人民自己的力量来统一祖国，实行北朝鲜的总选举。
    依据该决定，在一九四八年八月二十五日，有历史意义的朝鲜最高人民会议代议员的选举告成。
