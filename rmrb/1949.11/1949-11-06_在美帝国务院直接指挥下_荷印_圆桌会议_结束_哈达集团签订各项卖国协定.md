Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 5th (via TASS): The so-called Round Table Conference on the Indonesian question concluded in The Hague on November 2nd. The decisions made at the conference show that the purpose of the conference organizers—to maintain and strengthen the shackles of American and Dutch imperialism on Indonesia—has been achieved. The Hague newspaper "Trouw" emphasized that the entire work of the Round Table Conference was carried out under the direction of the US State Department. At the final meeting, various agreements were signed, and the full text of the provisional constitution of the so-called "United States of Indonesia" was also announced. According to this constitution, the "United States of Indonesia" includes the "Republic of Indonesia" and the various puppet states established by the Netherlands in recent years. The administrative power of the "United States of Indonesia" will be mainly concentrated in the President, Cabinet, Senate, and other institutions. The Cabinet will consist of ministers of defense, foreign affairs, internal affairs, finance, and economy. The Senate will consist of two representatives from each "state." The House of Representatives will consist of 150 representatives. One-third of the representatives will be from the "Republic of Indonesia." The House of Representatives does not have the right to dismiss the government or individual ministers. Within one year after the implementation of the constitution, a general election should be held in Indonesia using "secret ballot." The location of the President and ministers of the "United States of Indonesia" will be Batavia.

According to the constitution, the "United States of Indonesia" is supposedly independent, autonomous, and established on a federal basis. The "United States of Indonesia" must include all regions of Indonesia, except for New Guinea, which will be subject to separate negotiations. According to Aneta News Agency (the official Dutch news agency), the discussion on the New Guinea issue has been decided to be extended for one year. According to Trouw, the United States, based on its military strategic plans in the Pacific, is unwilling to include New Guinea in the "United States of Indonesia."

The conference also reached a special agreement that all Dutch colonial institutions in Batavia and other cities in Indonesia will be transferred to the government institutions of the "United States of Indonesia." Therefore, the administration of the Dutch colony will exist as before within the future "United States of Indonesia." In addition, the conference adopted the organizational law of the Dutch-Indonesian Federation, led by the Queen of the Netherlands. The full text of the agreement shows that the Netherlands will effectively represent the "United States of Indonesia" in diplomatic relations with other countries.

The agreement on financial and economic issues shows that the Netherlands will control all economic and financial policies of Indonesia. The government of the United States of Indonesia guarantees to repay the Dutch debt of 4.5 billion guilders. The agreement also stipulates that the Netherlands will "assist" the "United States of Indonesia" in areas such as training military officers and establishing special military schools. Any party participating in the federation, at the request of the other party and when necessary, will use its armed forces to be called upon by the other party. Dutch troops will "gradually" withdraw from Indonesia. However, "maritime security in Indonesia will be maintained by the Dutch Navy." In other words, Dutch military control over Indonesia is fully retained and executed by the Navy; the representatives of the various puppet "states" will, within the national institutions of the "United States of Indonesia," determine the colonial nature of this newly established country.

At the same time, news from Indonesia received in The Hague indicates that in recent weeks, the fighting activities of the Indonesian guerrillas, who are fighting for genuine national independence to get rid of imperialist enslavement, have been further expanded. Even the troops most loyal to Hatta refuse to obey his orders. Many Indonesian soldiers and officers refuse to be used to implement plans against Indonesian guerrillas.

　　在美帝国务院直接指挥下
  　荷印“圆桌会议”结束
    哈达集团签订各项卖国协定
    【新华社北京五日电】综合塔斯社消息：所谓印尼问题圆桌会议，已于十一月二日在海牙结束。会议所作出的决定显示：会议主持人的目的，即保持和加强美荷帝国主义对印尼的束缚已经达到。海牙“忠诚”报强调指出：圆桌会议的全部工作，都是在美国国务院的指挥下进行的。在最后一次会议上，各种协议都已签订，所谓“印尼合众国”的临时宪法全文，也已宣布。根据这个宪法，“印尼合众国”包括“印尼共和国”与荷兰这几年中所设立的各个傀儡邦，“印尼合众国”的行政权将主要地集中在总统、内阁、参院等机关。内阁将由国防、外交、内政、财政与经济各部部长组成。参院将由每“邦”两名代表组成。众院由一百五十名代表组成。众议员的三分之一，为“印尼共和国”的代表。众院没有罢免政府或个别部长的权利。在宪法实施后一年内，应在印尼举行“秘密投票方式”的大选。“印尼合众国”总统与部长们的所在地，将为巴达维亚。
    根据宪法，“印尼合众国”据说是独立、自主和建立在联邦基础之上的。“印尼合众国”必须包括印度尼西亚所有地区，仅新几内亚除外，关于该岛将另外进行谈判。据安普通讯社（荷官方通讯社）透露：关于新几内亚问题的讨论已决定延长一年。据忠诚报载：美国从它在太平洋上的军事战略计划出发，不愿将新几内亚包括在“印尼合众国”之内。
    会议还达到一种特别协定，即在巴达维亚以及印尼其它城市的全部荷兰殖民机构，都将移交给“印尼合众国”的政府机构。因此荷兰殖民地的行政，将象以前一样地存在于未来的“印尼合众国”内。此外，会议通过了由荷兰女王领导的荷印联邦组织法。协议全文显示：荷兰在其他国家的外交关系上，将实际上代表“印尼合众国”。
    关于财政与经济问题的协议显示：荷兰将控制印尼的全部经济与财政政策。印尼合众国政府保证偿还荷兰的债务达四十五亿盾之巨。协议并且规定：荷在兰训练军官及设立特别军事学校等方面，“援助”“印尼合众国”。参加联邦的任何一方，在另一方的要求下和遇有必要时，将以其武装部队给另一方调用。荷军将“逐渐地”自印尼撤退。但印尼“水上的安全将由荷兰海军来维持”。换句话说：荷兰对于印尼的军事控制，被充分地保留了下来，而由海军来执行；各傀儡“邦”的代表，则将在“印尼合众国”的国家机构内，决定这个新成立的国家的殖民地性质。
    与此同时，海牙方面所接来自印尼的消息指出：在最近几周来，为摆脱帝国主义奴役争取国家真正独立而斗争的印尼游击队的战斗活动，已更趋扩大。甚至最忠实于哈达的部队，都拒绝听从他的命令。许多印尼士兵与军官，都拒绝被利用来实行反对印尼游击队的计划。
