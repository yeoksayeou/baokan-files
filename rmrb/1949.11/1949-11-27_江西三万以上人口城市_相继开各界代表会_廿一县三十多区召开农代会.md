Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang Telegram: After Jiangxi Province was fully liberated in mid-September, cities with populations over 30,000, including Nanchang, Jiujiang, Ganzhou, Ji'an, Linchuan, Shangrao, and Qianshan, successively convened people's representative conferences in September and October. Twenty-one counties, including Nanchang, Fengcheng, Jinxian, Shangrao, and Leping, and over thirty districts convened the first district farmer representative conferences in October. The people's representative conferences and farmer representative conferences focused on discussing the restoration and development of industry and commerce as the guiding principle for future work in the cities, as well as the tasks and work steps in rural areas such as suppressing bandits, opposing local bullies, reducing rent and interest, production for disaster relief, and reasonable burden. Some counties and districts established preparatory committees for county and district-level farmers' associations through farmer representative conferences, further strengthening the people's sense of being masters of the country. As a result, the connection between the government and the masses in the new areas was greatly strengthened, enabling the work in the new areas to be carried out rapidly.
