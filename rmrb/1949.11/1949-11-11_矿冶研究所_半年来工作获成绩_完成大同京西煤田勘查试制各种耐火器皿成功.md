    Mining and Metallurgical Research Institute
    Achieves Results in Half a Year
    Completes Exploration of Datong and Jingxi Coalfields; Successful Trial Production of Various Refractory Utensils

    [This newspaper reports] Since the Mining and Metallurgical Research Institute under the Ministry of Heavy Industry of the Central People's Government began its work in April this year, it has achieved many results. The mining group has successively gone to Miyun and Jixian in Hebei Province, Mentougou in western Beijing, Datong in Shanxi Province, and Zibo and Jiaodong areas in Shandong Province, and completed nine investigation projects of tungsten mines, manganese mines, coal mines, and sulfur mines, all of which have been prepared into reports. In addition, it has completed the exploration of the Jingxi Coalfield and the consolidation plan of the coal industry, and drawn and organized dozens of charts and data on the overview, reserves, production, and sales of various minerals in North China. In addition to conducting mineral processing research on tungsten mines in Miyun and poor iron ore in Xuanhua, the mineral processing group has also assisted the Jixi Graphite Mine mineral processing plant in Songjiang, Northeast China, to solve technical problems, and assisted in solving the mineral processing problems of the Zhaoyuan Gold and Copper Mine in Shandong. The metallurgy group has completed the initial work on bearing alloy experiments and the design work of crucible melting furnaces, and has done 37 types of experimental inspection work for more than ten factories and mines such as Beijing Machine Factory, Tianjin Machine Factory, and Fengfeng Coal Mine. The laboratory group has analyzed more than 240 kinds of minerals, rocks, and various finished products, and conducted trial production of vanadium. All the efforts of the Refractory Materials Research Office have been devoted to the manufacturing and testing of refractory porcelain. Due to the shortage of goods on the market, it also carries out small-scale production to meet the urgent needs of various factories, mines, and schools. In the past six months, it has tested and manufactured 1,970 crucibles, evaporating dishes, combustion boats and other samples of various types. All the raw materials used in this experiment are domestic, and all the equipment is self-made. The finished products have extremely high fire resistance and acid resistance. The utensils can be heated to red-hot (about 900 degrees) and suddenly thrown into cold water without breaking, and can withstand five sudden cooling and heating cycles. In addition to completing the above-mentioned tasks, the institute has also established a quarterly editorial committee and decided to start publishing a quarterly journal in January next year to exchange experience and guide work. After summarizing its work in the past six months, the institute has clearly defined the guiding principles and tasks for its future work: to closely link research work with actual production departments to solve various technical problems; to strive to research various substitutes to alleviate the difficulties during the period of imperialist blockade; and to reserve and train as much specialized talent as possible for construction undertakings.

    Note: The Mining and Metallurgical Research Institute was originally an affiliated agency of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce of the Kuomintang government. It was established in 1938 and moved from Chongqing to Beijing in October 1946. After the liberation of Beijing, it was taken over by the Enterprise Department of the North China People's Government. Recently, the Ministry of Heavy Industry of the Central People's Government was established, and the institute is now under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Heavy Industry of the Central People's Government.

    矿冶研究所
    半年来工作获成绩
    完成大同京西煤田勘查试制各种耐火器皿成功
    【本报讯】中央人民政府重工业部所属矿冶研究所，自今年四月份开始工作以来，目前已获得不少成绩。采矿组曾先后分赴河北省之密云、蓟县，京西门头沟，山西省之大同，山东省之淄博胶东一带，完成了钨矿、锰矿、煤矿、硫磺矿等调查工作九件，均拟具了报告。另外并完成了京西煤田之勘查及煤业之整理计划，及绘制和整理了华北各种矿产之概况、储量、产销等图表资料数十种。选矿组除对密云之钨矿，宣化贫铁矿等进行了选矿研究外，并协助东北松江鸡西石墨矿选矿场解决了技术问题；协助解决了山东招远金铜矿之选矿问题。冶金组对轴承合金试验之初步工作，坩埚熔化炉之设计工作已完成，并为北京机器厂，天津机器厂，峰峰煤矿等十余厂矿，代做试验检查工作三十七种。化验组共计分析矿物岩石及各种成品二百四十余种，并进行了钒之试制。耐火材料研究室全部力量用在耐火磁的制造试验方面，因市面缺货，并兼作小量生产，供应各厂矿学校之急需，半年来共试验制造各种坩埚、蒸发皿、燃烧船及其他样品一千九百七十余件。该项试验所用原料全为国产，所有设备亦为自制，所出成品耐火度耐酸度极高，将器皿烧至红热（约九百度）骤投冷水中而不破裂，并可经五次骤冷骤热。该所除完成了上述各项工作外，并成立了季刊编辑委员会，决定于明年一月开始出版季刊，以交流经验，指导工作。该所于总结半年工作之后，明确规定了今后工作之方针与任务为：使研究工作与实际生产部门密切联系配合，解决各种技术问题。努力于各项代用品之研究，以减轻帝国主义封锁时期之困难，并对于建设事业所需之专门人材，尽量储备和培养。
    按：矿冶研究所，原为国民党政府工商部之附属机关，一九三八年成立，一九四六年十月由渝迁京。北京解放后，由华北人民政府企业部接管，最近中央人民政府重工业部成立，该所即归属中央人民政府重工业部。
