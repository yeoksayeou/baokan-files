The principal offender, Wald, was sentenced to six months imprisonment; accomplices Reberg (American), Christian (German) were each sentenced to four months imprisonment; Hickney (Italian) and Xun Silang (Japanese-American) were each sentenced to three months imprisonment. All five convicts received a one-year suspended sentence and were all to be deported from China. Wald was also ordered to pay Ji Yuheng USD 105 for three and a half months of sick leave, USD 60 for two months severance pay, USD 9 for nine days of wages, and all withheld wages were to be returned in full according to the actual amount withheld. All of the above were to be converted to local currency at the market rate. In addition, he was to compensate Ji Yuheng for medical expenses of RMB 1,365,000 and living expenses of RMB 2,500,000.
　　After Wald and other criminals unreasonably and forcibly dismissed Chinese worker Ji Yuheng on September 27th of this year, and twice gathered on October 11th to assault Ji Yuheng, who went to demand the wages due to him, and Ji Yuheng's brother Ji Yufeng who came forward to mediate, the Municipal Public Security Bureau, on October 24th, according to the complaint of 35 Chinese employees of No. 38, Sanjing Road, summoned and detained Wald and other criminals. After interrogation, the case was transferred to the Shenyang People's Court. The court conducted five trials and summoned the victims Ji Yuheng and Ji Yufeng. Witnesses Zou Yuanji, Yu Yongbin, Jin Dizhi, Gong Zhendong, Wu Hanzhang, Li Chunyun, Zhang Zhongying, etc. were questioned multiple times, and two on-the-spot confrontations were held. In addition to the photos of Ji Yuheng's injured right forehead and the forensic examination of the injuries, and the diagnosis of the municipal hospital doctors, which were taken at the scene of the assault by Wald and others, the court's presiding judge and others also inspected the scene during the trial period. Based on the indictment of the Municipal Public Security Bureau and the materials from the court's trial investigation, after careful study, the final trial was held at 12:00 noon on November 21st. The verdict was announced at 6:00 p.m. that day, and the session ended at 7:00 p.m. After the session, Wald returned to No. 38, Sanjing Road.
　　At the final trial and sentencing hearing, there were more than 30 representatives from Chinese employees of No. 38, Sanjing Road, the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions, the Shenyang Federation of Trade Unions, and other organizations, as well as the American national William N. Stokes of No. 38 Sanjing Road, present as observers. First, the prosecutor of the Shenyang Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau read the indictment, and then the President of the Municipal People's Court and Presiding Judge Zhang Yunlong, Judges Zhang Shixia, and Cheng Yuanyu conducted the trial. The victims Ji Yuheng and witness Yu Yongbin and others confronted the criminals Wald and others on the spot. Both human and material evidence were complete and the case was ironclad. The criminals signed their confessions and admitted that they had not been subjected to any abuse during detention and that the staff had been kind.
　　When the presiding judge solemnly read the verdict, the criminals Wald and others were silent. Everyone in the audience, except for the American national Stokes, was overjoyed and applauded. This once again proves that the Chinese people are not to be insulted, and the laws of the Chinese People's Government are solemn. Those who dare to violate our human rights and violate the laws of the People's Government will receive the legal sanctions they deserve.

　　沈人民法庭宣判美侨毒殴工人案
  　瓦尔德等判处徒刑
    【新华社沈阳二十六日电】引起沈阳市及全东北人民一致公愤的帝国主义分子美侨瓦尔德等聚众毒殴中国工人姬玉衡，及克扣工资等款的案件，已于十一月二十一日由沈阳市人民法院宣判。主犯瓦尔德处徒刑六个月，从犯雷贝格（美籍）、克力斯坦（德籍）各处徒刑四个月，希克尼（意籍）、巽四郎（美籍日人）各处徒刑三个月、五犯均缓刑一年，并均驱逐出中国国境。瓦尔德且应向姬玉衡付给三个半月休假金美元一百零五元，两月解雇金美元六十元，九天工资美元九元，工资扣留金按实际扣留数目全数发还。以上均按市价折合本币付给。此外并应赔偿姬玉衡之医药费本币一百三十六万五千元，生活损失费二百五十万元。
    自瓦尔德等凶犯于本年九月二十七日无理强迫解雇中国工人姬玉衡，并于十月十一日两次聚众毒殴前往索取应得之各项工金的姬玉衡及上前排解的姬玉峰后，市公安局于十月二十四日，根据三经路三十八号三十五名中国职工的控诉，将瓦尔德等凶犯传讯拘留，经审讯后将此案移送沈阳市人民法院。法院先后审讯五次，并传讯被害人姬玉衡、姬玉峰。证人邹元绩、于永宾、金倜之、巩振东、吴翰章、李春芸、张仲英等多次，且曾两次当庭对质，除瓦尔德等行凶时当场勘验的姬玉衡受伤倒地右额伤痕的照片、及法医的伤势检验、市立医院医生的诊断书等外，法院审判长等又于审讯期内到场勘察。根据市公安局的起诉书、法院的审讯调查的材料，经仔细研究后，于十一月二十一日中午十二时最后开庭审判。当日下午六时宣判，七时结束。结束后瓦尔德即返回三经路三十八号。
    在最后审讯及宣判庭上，有三经路三十八号的中国职工、东北总工会、沈市总工会等机关、团体的代表三十余人，及三经路三十八号之美侨史笃克ＷＩＬＬＩＡＭＮ·ＳＴＯＫＳ列席旁听，首由沈阳市人民政府公安局检察官宣读起诉书后，即由市人民法院院长兼审判长章云龙，审判员张士侠、程远誉进行审讯，并有被害人姬玉衡、证人于永宾等当场与凶犯瓦尔德等对证，人证物证俱全，铁案如山。凶犯在口供上签字，并承认在羁押期间未受任何虐待，工作人员态度良好。
    当审判长庄严地宣读了判决书后，凶犯瓦尔德等默默无言。旁听席上除了美侨史笃克一人而外，莫不喜形于色，额手称快。这再度证明中国人是不可侮的，中国人民政府的法令，是庄严的，如敢于侵犯我国人权，违犯人民政府的法令者，均将得到应有的法律制裁。
