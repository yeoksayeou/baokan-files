I. Telegram of congratulations from the Standing Committee of the Vietnam Cultural Association to the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles:
    To our friends of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles:

    We are delighted to learn of the founding of the People's Republic of China. The members of the Vietnam Cultural Association (Vietnamese workers in literature, art, science, and education) extend our congratulations to you. The founding of the People's Republic of China has opened a new era not only for Chinese history but also for the entire history of East Asia. This victorious news has given a very significant encouragement to our Vietnamese cultural circles and the entire Vietnamese people who are fervently preparing for a general counter-offensive to defeat the French bandits. We will work and fight with redoubled enthusiasm. The Chinese revolution has been successful, and the Vietnamese resistance war is also approaching victory. Our two countries will soon be able to freely connect and help each other to progress. Please convey our infinite respect to the Chinese people and the great leader Chairman Mao.

    Long live the People's Republic of China!
    Long live the independence and unity of Vietnam!
    Long live Chairman Mao!
    Long live President Ho!
    Long live the solidarity of the Chinese and Vietnamese nations!
    Standing Committee of the Vietnam Cultural Association

II. Reply telegram from the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles to the Standing Committee of the Vietnam Cultural Association:

    Thank you for your congratulations on the founding of our People's Republic of China. The Chinese people, after a long and arduous struggle, have finally achieved victory, not only gloriously building their own people's democratic dictatorship republic, but also opening up a broader path for the liberation struggles of all oppressed nations. The heroic Vietnamese people are an example of the struggle for liberation of oppressed nations and will surely finally defeat the French aggressors and re-establish their own free, democratic, peaceful, civilized, and prosperous country. Let us more closely join hands, bravely advance, and strive for the unity and cultural exchange of friendship between the Chinese and Vietnamese peoples.

    Long live the liberation of the Vietnamese people!
    Long live the People's Republic of China!
    All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles
          Chairman: Guo Moruo
          Vice Chairman: Mao Dun

    我文联祝贺
    我国文联复电致谢
    【新华社北京十二日电】越南文化会中央常务委员会致电中华全国文学艺术界联合会，祝贺中华人民共和国成立。中华全国文联特复电致谢。两电电文如下：
  一、越南文化会中央常务委员会贺电中华全国文学艺术界联合会诸位朋友：
    欣闻中华人民共和国成立，越南文化会同人（越南文艺科学教育工作者）特向诸位庆贺。中华人民共和国的成立，不但给中国历史而且给整个东亚历史开了一个新纪元。这一胜利的消息给了正在为战胜法贼而热烈准备总反攻的我们越南文化界和越南全体人民一个非常重大的鼓励，我们将加倍兴奋地工作和战斗。中国革命已经成功，越南抗战亦将接近胜利，我们两国文化很快就可能自由联系和相互帮助进步了。请诸位代我们向中国人民和伟大领袖毛主席转致无限的敬意。
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    越南独立统一万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
    胡主席万岁！

    越南文化会中央常务委员会
  二、中华全国文学艺术界联合会复电越南文化会中央常务委员会：
    感谢你们对于我们中华人民共和国的成立的祝贺。中国人民经过了长期的艰苦的斗争而最后终于取得了胜利，不但光荣地建造了自己的人民民主专政的共和国，而且也给所有被压迫民族的解放斗争开辟出了更宽阔的道路。英勇的越南人民是被压迫民族求解放的斗争的榜样，也一定会最后地战胜法国侵略者，重缔自己的自由、民主、和平、文明、强盛的国家。让我们更亲密的并肩携手，奋勇前进，并为中越两国人民友谊的团结和文化的交流而努力。
    越南人民解放万岁！
