　　Inner Mongolia Livestock Epidemic Prevention Injections Carried Out in Keshiketeng Banner

[By Our Correspondent] The Inner Mongolia Livestock Epidemic Prevention Team, in coordination with the emergency assistance of more than 130 staff members drawn from the Party and government organs of Keshiketeng Banner, has victoriously concluded the "rabbit-attenuated virus" vaccination work for livestock in the territory of the banner. As the masses have gained a further understanding of the prevention work, the concentration of cattle has been very rapid. From October 1st to 14th, within fourteen days, in addition to 1,490 steers being transported for sale and calving dairy cows, all 40,356 cattle in the banner were universally vaccinated. The vaccinated cattle accounted for 96% of the total number of cattle. Of the cattle infected with the epidemic in Bajiang Alru and Zhong Alru, apart from eighteen that were beyond saving due to the severity of the epidemic, 286 sick cattle have been cured. This vaccination has not only enabled the masses to further understand scientific treatment but will also play a significant role in the breeding of livestock next year.

　　内蒙克什克腾旗进行畜疫预防注射
    【本报讯】内蒙家畜防疫队在克什克腾旗境内对家畜“兔化毒”预防注射工作，在该旗党政机关抽调一百三十余名工作人员紧急配合协助下，业已胜利结束。由于群众对预防工作有了进一步的认识，牛群的集中甚为迅速。在十月一日至十四日十四天内除一千四百九十头正在跑运销的犍牛和下犊的乳牛外，全旗四万零三百五十六头牛均普遍实行了预防注射。经注射的牛占总牛数的百分之九十六。巴降阿鲁、忠阿鲁两努图克发生牛疫的牛，除十八头因疫情严重不可挽救外，二百八十六头病牛均已治愈。经此预防注射，不独使群众对科学治疗有了进一步认识，且对明年牲畜的繁殖上将起很大作用。
