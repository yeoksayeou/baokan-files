After Vice Chairman Li Lisan delivered a welcome speech, Chief Representative Choe Jing-de of North Korea delivered a response, expressing gratitude to the welcomers and stating: "The victory of the Chinese and Korean people is a great encouragement to the liberation movement of the Eastern nations. The working classes of China and Korea should unite even more closely and advance towards victory."

[Beijing News] Workers in the capital are enthusiastically carrying out various preparatory tasks to welcome the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference. Some units have not done enough in internationalist education and need to continue to strengthen it. The Preparatory Committee for Welcoming the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference and the Asian Women's Representative Conference dispatched inspection teams for the second time in early November for a week to eleven units, including the Shijingshan Power Plant, the Shijingshan Steel Plant, the People's Printing Plant, the Telecommunications Bureau, the Changxindian Railway Factory, and the Housheng Match Factory. Workers in each factory, knowing that trade union representatives from Asian and Australian countries would be visiting their factories, unanimously expressed their warm welcome. Large portraits of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, and Chairman Mao have been hung in the clubs of each unit, and various chess games and ping-pong tables have been set up. The Changxindian Railway Factory and Renli Carpet Company have renovated their ball fields. The walls of most clubs are covered with various charts and graphs of factory production and employee activities, as well as banners awarded to workers for their outstanding achievements in various fields. Various factories are continuing to carry out internationalist propaganda and education through night schools, study classes, and large lectures. The People's Printing Plant holds three large lectures a week led by responsible comrades, followed by group discussions the next day. However, some individual factories have not fully grasped the importance of internationalist education. Wang Kewu, the Propaganda and Education Committee member of the Beijing Telecommunications Bureau's trade union, has not made specific arrangements for internationalist education for a long time and should be corrected immediately.

    【北京讯】首都工人为迎接亚澳工会会议，正热烈进行各项准备工作；有的单位国际主义教育作的不够，需要继续加强。欢迎亚澳工会会议及亚洲妇女代表会议筹备会，于月初起一周间派出检查组第二次到石景山发电厂、石景山钢铁厂、人民印刷厂、电信局、长辛店铁路工厂、厚生火柴厂等十一单位进行检查。各厂工人知道亚澳各国工会代表将要来厂参观，一致表示热烈欢迎。各单位俱乐部内都挂上了马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林和毛主席的大幅画像，设置了各种棋类和乒乓球桌。长辛店铁路工厂和仁立地毯公司修整了球场。一般俱乐部墙上布满了工厂生产和职工活动等各种图表与工人在各方面优胜得奖的锦旗。各厂多以夜校、学习班、上大课等方式继续贯彻国际主义宣传教育。人民印刷厂每周由负责同志上三次大课，并于次日举行小组讨论。但也有个别工厂对国际主义教育还未充分抓紧进行，北京电信局工会宣教委员王克武长久未作国际主义教育的具体布置，应立即纠正。
