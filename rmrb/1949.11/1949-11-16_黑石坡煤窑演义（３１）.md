Yu Bao, for some reason, still didn't want to make things too difficult for Da San. He also wanted to make some money while the iron was hot, so he told Tian Lu in advance about Qian Danao's plan to punish Da San. Tian Lu had no idea what to do, so he discussed it with Shuan Cheng. They secretly agreed to give Yu Bao five yuan, and guaranteed to pay Da San's difference tax within half a month, asking Yu Bao to keep an eye on things, all behind Da San's back. Da San didn't know any of this. When they called him, he stood up, glaring, and went.

As soon as Qian Danao saw him, he asked, "What the hell kind of good things are you doing? Think about it! You've brought a catastrophe to our village! But we treated you like a human being and didn't settle accounts with you, and now you're acting up again! How dare you!" Da San turned his face away and didn't say a word. Qian Danao said, "Not only did you not pay the apportionment, but you didn't even report your household registration when you came back! Do you know what crime this is?" Da San said, "How can I be apportioned if I don't have a household registration?" Qian Danao jumped up and down and said, "That's because I was being nice to you! I registered your household, issued you a good citizen certificate, and even issued you a pass when you went out! I raised you to the sky! Good heavens! You don't want the household registration? Yu Bao! Bring the household registration book and cancel his registration, then tie him up and send him to Yangquan! Not reporting a household registration, privately harboring, is considered aiding the bandits! Yu Bao!" Yu Bao hurriedly pushed Da San out the door, smoothed things over with Qian Danao, and mentioned Tian Lu's guarantee to pay the money. At this time, Lin Bao and the little devils who came to pay also persuaded him. Qian Danao cursed and sent someone to call Tian Lu to write a guarantee, and Da San finally went home glaring.

After this, Da San often ran into snags when getting passes, and fewer people went out with him to sell sandstone goods, and no one asked him to rest at their place. His situation deteriorated day by day, and he even started selling his belongings for food. After the New Year, the Japanese devils wanted soldiers from the village. Qian Danao and Ju Bao planned who to arrest, and Shuan Cheng was among them. Fortunately, Bian Xiao happened to find out and leaked the information, so Shuan Cheng secretly went down the mine in Yangquan No. 4 Mine. After this, Da San felt even more depressed. In March or April, Shuan Cheng secretly returned to farm the land. As soon as Qian Danao found out, he wanted to arrest him and send him to Yangquan, even declaring that if he ran away again, he would drive his family out of the village. Helpless, Da San sold two more pieces of clothing and helped Shuan Cheng gather some money to smooth things over with others. Soon, Da San and his brother and Shuan Cheng couldn't afford the quarterly tax. Shuan Cheng's mother also died. Everyone sold this and that, and Da San even sold the old sheepskin coat that Lao Bai had given him. By winter, Tian Lu still had a pile of broken cotton wadding on his kang for the children to cover themselves with, but Da San and Shuan Cheng were completely bare. They had to burn the charcoal fire brightly every night, squatting by the stove for half the night. When they were really too sleepy, they would lie on the hot kang, warming the left side of their body but freezing the right. After a while, they would turn over and switch sides, enduring like this until dawn. How could they get through these days!

Shuan Cheng asked Bian Xiao to find a small sheep-herding job for his brother, and he pulled Da San to go down the mine in Yangquan No. 4 Mine. Da San said, "No! I get angry as soon as I see those Japanese devils! Besides, I don't want to work in that damned dark mine." Shuan Cheng said, "But can you endure this suffering in the village?" Da San said, "I don't give a damn about the traitors in the village! But when I see those Japanese devils, I want to fight them all to the death! Alas... I can't stand the sight of that mine either." Shuan Cheng said, "Just bear with it a little! Didn't you always say Lao Bai's words: Just wait until that day comes..." Da San said, "Isn't it been a few years now! No news, no information, who knows!" Shuan Cheng suddenly ran quietly outside the kiln to take a look, then turned back and closed the door tightly, telling Da San: That day will come! He had also seen someone like Lao Bai in the No. 4 Mine, and he had contacted the mountains again this time when he returned to the village. Da San hurriedly said, "No wonder I saw you going out and wandering around those times! Who else is in our village?" Shuan Cheng said, "Didn't you see me always looking for Lin Bao?" Da San was surprised and said, "Him? Although he's not a rich man, he's not poor either! Can he do it?" Shuan Cheng said, "He can! Think about it, these days, how can the people in the mountains find someone like us? Lin Bao has relatives in the mountains, which makes it easy to contact them; besides, that person's character is not bad." Then, Shuan Cheng quietly told Da San some information about the situation in the mountains. Da San listened, thinking that he really couldn't live in the village anymore, and farming was not something he was used to, so he also agreed to go to the No. 4 Mine. Da San walked back and forth in the kiln with his hands in his sleeves for a while, sighing, "Damn it! How can I get away from this mine!" Shuan Cheng said, "Don't say that! In the future, when that day comes, your skills will still come in handy!" Da San said, "As long as that day really comes, I'm willing to risk my life! Damn it, the coal in our village's big kiln is too strong! Alas... let's not talk about this!" Da San walked around again, suddenly staring with round eyes and asking Shuan Cheng, "Why didn't you tell me when you were doing things secretly in the village? Little brother!" Shuan Cheng said, "You? Didn't I tell you now? You, uh... your temper is not right, and the traitors in the village are worried about you..." Da San breathed a sigh of relief, looking a little unhappy.

　　黑石坡煤窑演义（３１）
    康濯
    玉宝不知怎么总还不愿待大三太难看，他并且也想趁这火候闹俩钱，便把乾大脑要制大三的事先告给了天禄；天禄没主意，跟拴成一商议，就瞒着大三答应了给玉宝五块钱，连大三的差款一道担保半月给到，叫玉宝关照点子。大三却不知这些，见叫他，他立起来瞪着两眼就去了。
    乾大脑一见他就问：“你尽干他妈些什么好事呀你？你想想！你给咱村惹下的是滔天大祸哩！可咱把你当个人，没跟你算帐的，你小子这会就又发横啦！好大胆！”大三脸一撇，不言声，乾大脑道：“搁着摊款不缴，回来还连个户口也不报哩！你知道这是犯了什么罪？”大三道：“我没户口可怎么又摊款？”乾大脑跳着脚道：“那是老子抬举你！给你记上户口发了良民证，你出去还给开路条！老子把你小子抬上了天！好家伙！你不乐意要户口么？玉宝！拿户口册来，下了他的户口，捆起来送阳泉！不报户口，私自窝藏，通匪论罪！玉宝！”玉宝忙把大三推到门外，跟乾大脑圆转了两句，并说了说天禄担保给钱的事；这时来缴款的林宝和小洋鬼们又打劝了一番，乾大脑就一边骂着一边派人去叫天禄写保状，大三才又瞧着两眼回了家。
    此后，大三开路条也常碰钉子了，跟他出去卖砂货的人也少了，也没人寻他歇着了，他光景又一天不如一天，还卖开家什换吃的了。过了年，日本鬼子给村里要兵，乾大脑跟聚宝计划了些要抓的人，里边就有拴成，亏得扁小碰巧知道了透了个讯，拴成就跑到阳泉四矿偷偷下窑去，这以后大三更闷的慌。到三四月，拴成又偷回来养种地，乾大脑一得知，就要抓他送阳泉，还声言：他要再跑，就撵他一家出村；没法，大三就又卖了两件衣裳，帮拴成凑了几个钱跟人家圆转。不久，大三弟兄俩和拴成都掏不起季款，拴成他妈又死了，大伙卖这卖那，大三连老白给他的破皮袄也卖了；到冬天，天禄的炕上倒还有一堆破棉花套给孩孩们盖，大三和拴成弟兄却都是光打光，只得每日黑家把炭火烧旺，在灶边圪＠半宿，到实在困的不行，就上热炕头躺着，暖了左半边身子却冻了右半边，一会再翻过身来换换，这么挨到天明。这日子可怎么熬下去啊！
    拴成托扁小给他兄弟找了个小放羊的营生，他就拉大三去阳泉四矿下窑去。大三说：“不！我这会见了日本洋鬼就要发火！再说我也不想干他妈窑黑了。”拴成说：“可村里这罪你能受下去？”大三说：“村里汉奸们我还尿不着他们哩！可我要见了日本洋鬼，就想一个顶一个拚他妈的！唉……我也见不得窑底下那架势”。拴成道：“忍着点子嘛！你不是常说那老白的话：单等有朝一日……”大三说：“这不是又几年啦！没音没讯的，可谁知道呀！”拴成忽地悄悄跑到窑外看了看，回头把门关得严严实实地，告诉大三：那有朝一日会有头的！他在四矿也见过一个象老白那样的人，他这回回村里也就跟山里边联络过。大三忙道：“怪难那些时见你短不了瞎出去转游的！咱村还有谁们？”拴成道：“你没见我老是找林宝？”大三吃惊道：“他？他虽说不是财主吧，可也不是穷人呀！他能行？”拴成说：“能行！你想，这年月，人家山里的怎么能找上咱这号家门？林宝嘛，他山里边有亲戚，好联络；再说那人人性也不赖。”接着，拴成悄悄说给大三一些山里边的情由，大三一边听着，一边想着村里实在也没法过，再说养种地也到底不惯，就也答应去四矿了。大三又抄着两手在窑里来回大步走了一阵，叹息着：“＠他妈！怎么就撇不开这窑呀！”拴成说：“可别那么说！往后，有那一天，你这把式还会吃得开的！”大三道：“只要真有那一天，我拚死命干也行！＠他妈咱村这大窑炭太强！唉……别说这啦！”大三又猛走了一阵，忽地瞪着圆眼问拴成道：“怎么你在村里干悄悄事，连我也不告给？小兄弟！”拴成说：“你么？这不是告给啦？你，呃……你脾性不对，村里汉奸又操心着你的……”大三长出了一口气，象有点不高兴。
