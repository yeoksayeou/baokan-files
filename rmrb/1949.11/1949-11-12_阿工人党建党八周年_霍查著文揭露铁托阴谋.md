    Xinhua News Agency, Tirana: All of Albania celebrated the eighth anniversary of the founding of the Albanian Workers' Party on the 8th. Enver Hoxha, General Secretary of the Workers' Party, published an article in the Workers' Party's newspaper, "People's Voice," recounting the Tito group of Yugoslavia's attempts to invade Albania and its miserable defeat. Hoxha pointed out: "Although our party is still a young party without much experience, it has overcome all obstacles, learned from the experience of the Soviet Bolshevik Party, and received the Soviet Union's selfless assistance. Thanks to its correct and wise policies, and its loyalty to Marxism-Leninism and the Soviet Union, our party has thwarted all the conspiracies of the imperialists and their lackeys, and will continue to thwart them in the future."
