People of Beijing Express Their Sentiments
　　Supporting People's Representative Conferences at All Levels

[Our Newspaper] Workers, farmers, students, and industrialists and businessmen in Beijing are extremely excited about the convocation of the Second Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference and have expressed their sentiments and enthusiastically put forward their opinions. After reading Mayor Nie's report at the Second Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference, Zhou Deheng, a worker from the Second Telephone Bureau, said: The meticulous nature of the recent household registration proves that the government has implemented the resolutions of the First People's Representative Conference at All Levels, paying attention to improving the capital's public security, ensuring the revolutionary order of the capital and the lives and property of the people. Wang Baoheng said he was satisfied with the government's measures to regulate traffic, reducing traffic accidents on the streets, and the police were also more responsible. Zhang Guowu praised the thoroughness of the current epidemic prevention work; he was also satisfied with the government's solution to the problem of schooling for workers' children. Ye Bingkun said: I hope that more primary schools will be added and more hospitals will be established. Wang Jishou said: I hope that production will increase in quantity to solve the unemployment problem. Zheng Jiying said: I hope to expand the organization of cooperatives and supply and marketing cooperatives so that the general working people can reduce the exploitation of merchants. He believes that it is necessary to promote the significance of cooperatives first.

Liu Gang, deputy director of the Beijing Municipal Farmers' Association Preparatory Committee, said: The convocation of this People's Representative Conference at All Levels marks a further step in the unity of the people of Beijing. At present, land reform is being implemented in the suburbs, which is the most urgent demand of the vast number of farmers. At the first representative conference, it was decided to implement land reform quickly, and today it has been launched vigorously. Our 400,000 farmers in the suburbs will definitely step up production, victoriously complete the land reform task, and build the people's capital together with the worker brothers and all citizens.

Qi Mingyuan, a farmer from Nanyuan, said: This time, Cao Jianrong from our village also participated in the People's Representative Conference at All Levels. He represented our farmers in electing the mayor, which is the real right of the people. I am over fifty years old and have never seen a farmer act as a representative to make suggestions to the government, but now I have!

Wen Jingzhong, a cadre of the Xinkai Road Cooperative in the 14th District of Beijing Suburbs, said: Our People's Representative Conference at All Levels truly represents the opinions of the people at all levels. Our briquette cooperative also recommended Li Jincheng to participate. At the meeting, Mayor Nie reported on his work to everyone, asking everyone to make suggestions and check on the work. The people are truly masters of their own affairs. How can we not support our own government?

After hearing the news of the opening of the Second Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference, the students of Tsinghua University were very excited and paid great attention to it. In particular, seeing that this conference was to exercise the functions and powers of the People's Congress and elect the mayor and members of the Municipal People's Government, they believed that this was the rapid development of the revolutionary situation and the first concrete realization of the people's democratic dictatorship in Beijing. The students felt a sense of honor that they had representatives participating in this conference.

Bian Zhusheng, Chairman of the Beijing Textile Industry Council, said: In the three months since the first People's Representative Conference at All Levels, we have personally witnessed how the Beijing Municipal People's Government has earnestly implemented the resolutions of the previous conference, overcome difficulties, carried out municipal construction, and completed the preparatory work for this conference. Now, the Second People's Representative Conference at All Levels has been convened rapidly in the expectation of the people. The attending representatives can decide on municipal guidelines and policies and elect their own government. This is a truly democratic manifestation of historical significance and also an ironclad proof to the people who have been ruled by the reactionaries that the past reactionary government was a fake democracy. This is the result of Chairman Mao's wise leadership, the heroic and good fighting of the People's Liberation Army, and the seamless unity and hard work of people from all walks of life. Our industrialists and businessmen have contributed too little in the past. In the future, we must strive to improve our political awareness and fulfill our responsibilities in economic construction and complete the task of building the people's capital.

Wang Jianmin, chairman of the Nanyuan Town Chamber of Commerce, said: "The People's Representative Conference at All Levels is a truly great people's conference. All the representatives are people who can represent our opinions. The city's industrial and commercial representatives alone number fifty-seven, ranking second among the people's organizations. In the future, there is hope for the development of industry and commerce that is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood."

　　京市人民发表感想
　　拥护各界人民代表会
    【本报讯】京市工人、农民、学生和工商业家，对于京市第二届各界人民代表会议的召开，极为兴奋，纷纷发表他们的感想，并热情的提出意见。电话二局的工人看了聂市长在第二届各界人民代表会议上的报告之后，周德亨说：根据最近户口单的周密，证明政府执行了第一次各界人民代表会议的决议，注意把首都治安问题搞好，使首都革命秩序和人民的生命财产有了保障。王宝恒说他满意政府整理交通的措施，街上减少了车祸，警察也负责了。章国武称赞此次防疫工作做得很彻底；对于政府解决工人子弟的失学问题，他也满意。叶炳坤说：希望小学校还要增加，多设医院。王继寿说：希望生产增加数量，以解决失业问题。郑纪营说：希望扩大组织合作社和供销社，使一般劳动人民可减少商人的中间剥削。他认为首先要多多宣传合作社的意义。
    京市农会筹委会副主任刘刚说：这一次各界人民代表会议的召开，标志着全北京市人民更进一步的团结。目前郊区正实行土地改革，这是广大农民最迫切的要求。在第一次代表会议上，才决议迅速实行土改，今天已轰轰烈烈地展开了。我们郊区四十万农民一定加紧生产，胜利的完成土改任务，与工人兄弟，全体市民一道来建设人民的首都。
    南苑农民齐明远说：这次各界人民代表会议开会，我们村的曹建荣也去参加了，他代表我们农民选举市长，这是人民真正的权利。我五十多岁了，从没看到过农民当过代表向政府提意见，如今却看到了！
    京郊十四区新开路合作社干部闻靖中说：咱们的各界代表会，真正代表着各界人民的意见，我们煤球合作社也推李金成去参加。会上聂市长给大家报告工作，让大家提意见检查工作，人民自己真正当家作主了。我们怎能不拥护自己的政府？
    清华大学的同学们听到北京第二届各界人民代表会议开幕的消息以后，都很兴奋，很重视，尤其是看到这次会议要执行人民代表大会的职权，选举市长和市人民政府委员，他们认为这是革命形势的发展迅速和人民民主专政在北京的第一次具体实现。同学们对于自己有代表参加这个会议，感到一种光荣。
    北京纺织业理事长卞祝升说：第一次各界代表会议后三个月以来，我们亲眼看见北京市人民政府如何的切实执行了上次大会的决议案，克服困难，进行市政建设，并完成这次大会的准备工作。现在，第二次各界人民代表会议迅速地在人民期望中召开了，出席代表能够决定市政方针和政策，选举自己的政府，这是具有历史意义的真正民主的表现，也是对被反动派统治过的人民揭穿过去反动政府假民主的铁证。这是毛主席的英明领导、人民解放军的英勇善战和各阶层人民的团结无间与艰苦奋斗的结果。我们工商业界过去在各方面贡献太少了。今后我们一定努力提高政治觉悟，在经济建设中尽我们的职责，完成建设人民首都的任务。
    南苑镇商会王建民说：“各界代表会议是真正伟大的人民会议，代表全是能代表咱们意见的人，全市工商界代表就有五十七人，在人民团体中占第二位，今后有利于国计民生的工商业可有发展的希望了。”
