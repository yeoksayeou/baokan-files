　　I. Remedial Measures for Spring Planting of Autumn Wheat

　　Autumn wheat must be sown in the autumn. If it is changed to spring sowing, its seedlings will only grow vegetatively, without heading and bearing grain. If the autumn weather is unfavorable and sowing is not possible, wouldn't this reduce the harvest? To remedy this loss, the method of spring planting of autumn wheat can be adopted.

　　However, autumn wheat must undergo vernalization before it can be converted to spring sowing. The vernalization method is an ancient Chinese practice, with a long history in the Taihang Mountains area. The Soviet agricultural biologist Lysenko has further elucidated this. The method involves treating autumn wheat with low temperatures during the coldest days of winter, which is the meaning behind mixing seeds with snow water in the Taihang Mountain wheat region. This replaces the winter cold that it did not experience in the soil. The temperature during treatment should not be lower than two to three degrees below zero Celsius (freezing point), with around zero degrees being appropriate. The moisture content during treatment should be 37 liters of water per 100 kilograms of wheat grains. This water should be sprinkled and mixed three times to ensure complete absorption by the wheat grains. After mixing, pile them up for two to three days. During this time, the temperature should be between five and ten degrees Celsius, so that it begins to germinate. When three to five percent of the wheat grains begin to germinate and burst, reduce the temperature to zero to two degrees Celsius. If the skin of the wheat grains has not completely burst after fifteen to twenty days, more water should be added, otherwise the vernalization process will stop. Add approximately five to eight liters of water per 100 kilograms of wheat grains. The treatment time is approximately forty-five to fifty days, which is traditionally forty-nine days near the Taihang Mountains. During treatment, air must circulate, but care must be taken to prevent freezing. After treatment, the wheat grains are air-dried, and can be sown when the soil thaws in the spring. This wheat, after vernalization, grows very quickly after sowing, and heading and grain filling are only a few days later than autumn wheat, with little difference in yield.

　　II. Remedial Measures for Winter Planting of Autumn Wheat

　　Winter planting of autumn wheat is limited to areas with milder climates. For example, in Henan Province, the wheat sowing period is approximately from late September to mid-October. Because the climate is warmer, the sowing period can be extended to the beginning of winter, but the amount of seed used per acre should be slightly increased to compensate for the losses suffered by the seedlings during the winter.

　　III. Methods for Transforming Autumn Wheat into Spring Wheat

　　As mentioned in the first point, vernalize autumn wheat and sow it in the spring. After doing this continuously for three to five years (the time varies depending on the wheat variety), it is no longer necessary to continue the vernalization method and it can be directly sown as spring wheat. This autumn wheat, after being transformed into spring wheat, is the same as ordinary spring wheat. In the high mountain areas of our country, as well as the areas near the Great Wall (spring wheat region) and near the Liupan Mountains, this method of transforming autumn wheat into spring wheat has been used since ancient times.

　　The above methods of wheat transformation prove the richness of our country's agricultural content. Dr. Stoletov, Dean of the Timiryazev Agricultural Academy of the Soviet Union, said: Chinese farmers are very intelligent. Taking the transformation of wheat as an example, farmers in China and the Soviet Union have made common creations. Today, Soviet agricultural science has greatly progressed along with their progressive politics. We, the farmers of all of China, have the conditions and the foundation to learn from the farmers of the Soviet Union and improve agriculture throughout the country.

　　秋天种麦误时的补救方法
    华大农学院农业生物学小组
　　一、秋麦春种的补救方法
    秋小麦，必须要在秋天播种。若是改在春天播种，它那苗叶就徒然生长，不能抽穗结实。倘若秋天因为气候不好，不能下种，岂不减少收成？为了换救这种损失，可采用秋麦春种的方法。
    但秋麦必须经过春化作用，才能改为春播。春化作用的方法，乃是我国的古法，在太行山一带，有很长时期的历史。苏联农业生物学家李森科，更有一些阐明。其法，将秋麦于三九天内用低温处理，即是太行山麦区用雪水拌种的意义，用来代替它没有在地土中过冬所感受到的冬天的寒冷。处理时的温度，不得低于摄氏表零度（冰点）下二至三度，大概以零度为适宜。处理时的水分，在一百公斤麦粒中，需要三十七公升的水。这些水须分三次洒拌，使麦粒完全吸收。拌匀后堆积二三日，这时温度要在摄氏表五到十度，使它开始发芽。当百分之三到五的麦粒开始发芽爆裂时，就减低它的温度为摄氏表零度到二度。若是在十五到二十天以后，麦粒的皮还没有完全爆裂，就要加多一些水，不然春化作用就会停止。大概每百公斤麦粒再加水五到八公升，处理的时间大约四十五到五十天，太行山附近习俗为四十九天。处理时要流通空气，但要注意不使它冻坏。处理后的麦粒使它风干，等到春天地土解冻，即可播种，这种经过春化作用的麦子，播种后生长很快，抽穗结籽比秋麦晚不了几天，产量也不差什么。
　　二、秋麦冬种的补救方法
    秋麦冬种，只限于气候较温和的地方，例如在河南地方，小麦播种时期，约在九月下旬到十月中旬，因其气候较暖，播种期可延长到立冬，但须略为增加每亩所用的播种量，以补充幼苗经冬所受的损失。
　　三、改造秋麦为春麦的方法
    如第一条所说的，将秋麦春化，于春天播种，一连行之三年到五年（因麦种不同，时间长短不等），就不必再继续行春化方法，可以直接当作春麦播种，这种秋麦改为春麦之后，与普通的春麦一样。我国的高山地带，以及长城附近区域（春麦区）和六盘山附近，自古以来就有采用这种方法改造秋麦为春麦的。
    由于以上几项小麦的改造方法，可以证明我国农业内容的丰富。苏联第米里亚席夫农学院院长斯托列托夫博士说：中国的农民是很聪明的。就以改造小麦来说，中苏两国的农民都有共同的创造，今天苏联的农业科学，已跟随它们进步的政治而大大进步了，我们全中国的农民，很有条件，很有基础，向苏联的农民学习，改进全国的农业。
