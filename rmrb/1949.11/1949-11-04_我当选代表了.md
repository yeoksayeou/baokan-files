　　I Was Elected as a Representative
　　Zhou Zhongling, Female Worker of Beijing Garment Factory
　　At a little after 1:00 PM on October 20th, as I entered the factory gate, I saw mats spread out in the courtyard, and comrades from the entire factory were sitting in rows. When everyone saw me, they shouted loudly, "Look! She's here! She's here! Our she's here!" Little comrade Li Yuzhen even ran up to me, pointed at me, and asked, "Why are you just arriving? Look, everyone is waiting for you! Today is your big day, just waiting for a decorated car to pick you up!" At that time, I was very surprised. Why was everyone welcoming me like this today!
　　I stepped into the meeting place, ah! I saw! Today is our factory's election to participate in the "Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Workers' Representative Conference." Today's election is the factory's third and final round of voting. Because the workers all recognize the extreme importance of this matter and that it cannot be taken lightly, the quality of the elected representative directly impacts our urgent problems, so the workers elected seriously and cautiously three times. Their faces showed infinite excitement, clapping and singing morale songs. I was truly excited beyond words.
　　The conference began. The chairman reported the significance of this election and the matters that should be paid attention to during the election, and then the ballots were distributed. At this time, the meeting place was extremely quiet.
　　In less than five minutes, the ballots were collected. When the teller kept calling out my name, I felt very nervous, like an ant on a hot pot.
　　When the chairman announced that a total of 168 people attended from the entire factory, and excluding two invalid votes, I received 160 votes, my excited heart almost jumped out, but I was also very ashamed, thinking to myself, how can I, with my weak ability, bear the responsibility of this representative?!
　　Then, Comrade Li Yuzhen, on behalf of everyone, presented me with flowers and a speech. When Comrade Yuzhen said, "You are the most loyal, brave, diligent, strong, and most prestigious among us all! You can sacrifice your own interests to help us! You can understand the problems among us, you can help us move forward! From now on, our spirit will be entrusted to you..." Ah! I was so moved that tears flowed out! I am ashamed! I am very ashamed. How should I act with such expectations from everyone?
　　At the same time, it reminded me that under the rule of the reactionaries, we workers had no right to elect representatives! At that time, they always said that we were smelly workers, looked down on us, and treated us workers as beasts of burden! Now it is different. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the workers are completely liberated and have become masters!
　　Therefore, I cannot shrink back, I must be strong! I must be sincere! I must accept the glorious responsibility with unparalleled enthusiasm! In the future, the construction of our capital, the welfare of our workers, and the problems among our workers are all on the shoulders of this representative, so I must be a very loyal servant of the people to shoulder my glorious responsibility!

　　我当选代表了
    北京被服厂女工  周仲玲
    十月二十日下午一点多钟时，我一进工厂大门，看见院中铺着席，全厂同志一排一排的坐满了。大家看见我，便都大声的喊：“快看！来了！来了！我们的她来了！”小同志李玉珍更跑到我面前指着我问：“你怎么刚来呀？你看看大家就等你了！今天是你大喜的日子，就等花车接你哪！”当时我非常奇怪，今天大家为什么这样欢迎我呢！
    我步入会场，啊！看见了！今天是我们全厂选举参加“北京市市总工会的工人代表大会”，今天的选举是本厂第三天末次的竞选了，因工友们对这件事都认识到十分重要，不可马虎，选的代表好坏，是直接影响我们本身迫切的问题，所以工友们认真慎重的选举了三次。她们的脸上都表现出无限的兴奋，鼓着掌，唱着拉拉歌。我真有说不出的兴奋。
    大会开始，主席报告这次选举的意义及选举时应注意的事项后，便开始发票选举，这时会场上静极了。
    没有五分钟，票已收齐，当唱票人不断的喊着我的名字时，我心中非常紧张，就好象热锅中的蚂蚁。
    当主席报告，全厂共出席一百六十八名，除去两张废票外，我获得了一百六十票时，我兴奋的心都要跳出来了，但是我又非常惭愧，心想，能力薄弱的我，那儿能担起这个代表的责任呢？！
    接着李玉珍同志代表大家向我献花、献词，当玉珍同志说到：“你是我们大家中最忠诚、勇敢、勤劳、坚强、最有威信的一个；你能牺牲自己的利益来帮助我们！你能了解我们中的问题，你能帮助我们前进！今后我们的精神要寄托在你的身上……”啊！我激动得流出泪来！我惭愧！我非常惭愧，大家对我这样的期望，我该如何去作呢？
    同时使我回想到在反动派统治时，我们工人那有选代表的份呀！那时他们总说我们是臭工人，看不起我们，拿我们工人当牛马看待！现在可不同了，在共产党领导下的工人，完全解放了，做主人了！
    所以我不能畏缩，我要坚强！我要诚恳！要用无比的热诚来接受光荣的责任！今后我们首都的建设，我们工人的福利，我们工人中的问题，都在这次代表的肩上，所以我一定要为人民做一个很忠诚的勤务员，来担负起我光荣的责任！
