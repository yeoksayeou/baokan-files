Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 8th. All circles in Pyongyang enthusiastically commemorated the 32nd anniversary of the Soviet Socialist Revolution. Under the auspices of the Korean Fatherland United Democratic Front, more than 1,500 people, including workers, suburban farmers, students, young women, and cultural workers from Pyongyang, participated in the commemorative meeting held at the National Art Theater at 7 p.m. on the 6th. Kim Il-sung, Premier of the Korean Cabinet, Kim Gu-bong, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly, cabinet members, representatives from all walks of life, Soviet Ambassador Sidorov, and Wen Shizhen, Chief Representative of the Chinese Northeast Commercial Delegation, were all in attendance. Minister of Justice Lee Seung-yup delivered a report at the meeting. He first pointed out that the anniversary of the great Soviet October Socialist Revolution is not only a festival for the Soviet people, but also a festival for peace-loving people and oppressed nations around the world. The Korean people commemorate it with the same excitement as celebrating their own National Day. He said: If there had been no Soviet October Revolution, and if there had been no decisive victory of the Soviet army in the worldwide anti-fascist war, especially the victory over Japanese imperialism, the Korean people could not have been liberated. In the report, whenever the speaker mentioned the name of Marshal Stalin, the audience burst into thunderous applause to express their heartfelt gratitude to him. Lee Seung-yup's report finally pointed out that today, not only has the strength of the international peace, democracy and socialism camp greatly exceeded that of the imperialist camp, but the people's democratic forces in Korea have also become many times stronger than the reactionary forces of the Lee Seung-man gang. As long as the entire Korean people unite around the democratic government headed by Premier Kim Il-sung, and persist in the struggle against American imperialism and its running dog, the Lee Seung-man puppet government, the great cause of national reunification and independence will soon be realized, and this is the most meaningful commemoration of the 32nd anniversary of the October Revolution for the Korean people. After the report, the meeting unanimously passed a congratulatory telegram to Marshal Stalin before it concluded. Afterwards, the Soviet art delegation and various Korean art groups performed.

　　平壤各界盛大集会
  　金日成金＠奉等均出席
    【新华社平壤八日电】平壤党政军民各界热烈纪念苏联社会主义革命三十二周年。在朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线的主持下，平壤市的工人、效区农民、学生、青年妇女和文化工作者一千五百余人，参加了六日晚七时在国立艺术剧场举行的纪念大会。朝鲜内阁总理金日成、最高人民会议常任委员会委员长金＠奉暨各阁员、各界代表和苏联大使西地科夫，以及中国东北商业代表团首席代表文士桢等均出席。会上由司法部长李承烨作报告。他首先指出，伟大的苏联十月社会主义革命纪念日，不仅是苏联人民的节日，也是全世界爱好和平的人民和被压迫民族的节日。朝鲜人民以庆祝自己的国庆日一样兴奋的心情，来纪念它。他说：假如没有苏联的十月革命，假如没有在全世界反法西斯战争中苏联军队的决定性的胜利，特别是打垮日本帝国主义的胜利，朝鲜人民就不可能获得解放。在报告中每当报告人提到斯大林大元帅的名字时，全场掌声雷动，表示对他的衷心感谢。李承烨的报告最后指出，在今天，不但国际和平民主与社会主义阵营的力量大大超过帝国主义阵营，而朝鲜国内的人民民主力量，也已较李承晚匪帮的反动力量强大多倍。只要全朝鲜人民一致团结在以金日成总理为首的民主政府周围，坚持反对美帝国主义及其走狗李承晚傀儡政府的斗争，祖国统一独立的伟业很快就会实现，而这正是朝鲜人民对十月革命三十二周年最有意义的纪念。报告毕，大会在一致通过向斯大林大元帅致敬电后结束。会后并有苏联艺术代表团和朝鲜各艺术团体表演。
