　　On Trade Unions for Educational Workers
　　(Based on the Report by Li Lisan, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, at the Beijing College and University Faculty and Staff Representative Conference)

　　(I) Organize
　　Now, it is entirely necessary and possible to organize trade unions for educational workers, including both mental laborers such as professors, lecturers, teaching assistants, faculty, and staff, and physical laborers such as workers and school police.

　　The New Democratic regime has been established and must rely on organized masses to strengthen and consolidate it, requiring that the four friends under the New Democratic regime—the working class, the peasantry, the petty bourgeoisie, and the national bourgeoisie—all be organized. First and foremost, the working class, as the leading class, must be fully organized. Because only through organization can greater strength be exerted to accomplish the great historical task of building a New China.

　　(II) Educational Workers are a Part of the Working Class

　　In the broad sense of the working class, all laborers who rely on wages and salaries as their source of livelihood, whether physical or mental laborers, belong to the category of the working class. Educational workers, including professors, lecturers, teaching assistants, faculty, and staff, like workers and police, rely on wages and salaries to maintain their lives and are employed laborers, that is, they all belong to the working class. Because the working class, like other classes, has many strata. Among them, industrial workers are the basic stratum of the working class; because they were most oppressed and exploited in the old society, they are the most revolutionary, resolute, and thorough, and they have also been tempered by factories, making them the most organized. Others, such as shop assistants, handicraft workers, and mental laborers including professors and engineers, although their lifestyles and ideologies differ from those of industrial workers, are laborers who rely on salaries to maintain their lives, so they also belong to the working class.

　　But belonging to the working class does not mean being a worker. Professors and engineers are a stratum within the working class, and their individual identities remain as professors and engineers, or collectively as staff, not workers. Just as some handicraft workers who sell their own products, such as shoemakers who make and sell leather shoes, are generally called workers, but in essence, they belong to the petty bourgeoisie, not employed laborers, that is, not to the working class.

　　Therefore, another question is involved: the difference between family origin and individual identity. A university professor may come from a landlord or bourgeois family, but as long as his primary source of income is salary rather than reliance on his family, he remains a salaried laborer. Of course, his family origin and social environment inevitably affect his ideology, so intellectuals in the position of employed laborers often have bourgeois or petty-bourgeois ideologies and lifestyles, and thus often develop a mentality of belittling workers and physical laborers. This is why intellectuals are called bourgeois or petty-bourgeois intellectuals.

　　(III) Break Down the Opposition Between Physical and Mental Labor

　　The separation, division, opposition, and even antagonism between physical and mental labor are products of history. In primitive times, human labor was in a low-level state. There was no distinction between physical and mental labor. As human history progressed, social labor became specialized, and after classes emerged in society, the differentiation and opposition between physical and mental labor became increasingly apparent. Mencius stated that "Those who labor with their minds govern others; those who labor with their strength are governed by others," indicating that knowledge and culture became the monopoly of the ruling class, and the ruled class was deprived of the right to enjoy knowledge and culture. It is clear that the opposition between physical and mental labor corresponds to class opposition, and that the division and opposition between physical and mental labor are products of class society. By the time of capitalism, on the one hand, the knowledge level of some skilled workers was raised due to the needs of industrial production, but the division and opposition between mental and physical labor became even more acute.

　　Workers became appendages of machines, doing only a very simple type of labor year after year, making people deformed. Engineers only knew drawings and numbers, and they manufactured the same items as workers, but capitalists connected them through a coercive relationship of employment. Only in socialist Soviet Union, after eliminating all oppression and exploitation, did physical and mental laborers both become people serving the people, consciously and closely uniting to strive for the same goal. This conscious and voluntary labor created astonishing achievements, often exceeding the production records of general capitalist industries. This is why the Soviet Union was able to catch up with and surpass Germany and Britain, which were originally fifty to one hundred years ahead of Tsarist Russia, in three five-year plans (actually only thirteen years). Currently, in the Soviet Union, the opposition between physical and mental labor is gradually being eliminated, the cultural level of the working class has greatly improved, and almost all intellectuals are intellectuals from working-class and peasant backgrounds, with completely equal political and social status. The difference between physical and mental labor has been greatly reduced, but it has not been completely eliminated, and only in communist society can the two be completely unified. Therefore, from the initial low-level state of labor without distinction between physical and mental, to the division and acute opposition between the two in class society, and finally to the unification of the two in communist society—but this is the highest unity, which precisely embodies the dialectical law of development of the negation of the negation.

　　Therefore, the elimination of the opposition between physical and mental labor is an inevitable trend of social development, and capitalism has prepared conditions for us in some aspects. It has turned most mental laborers into employed laborers and the exploited, aligning their interests with those of physical laborers. Therefore, in the history of the worker's movement, there have long been facts of mental and physical laborers uniting and organizing together to fight against the capitalists' cruel exploitation.

　　Today, Chinese society is a New Democratic society, a stage of transition to socialism. Our goal is also to gradually eliminate the opposition between physical and mental labor that hinders social progress, and to make the two consciously and voluntarily unite closely to improve social production and culture, and promote the faster progress of society.

　　Now we have this possibility to do so. Looking back to the past, in the education sector, even university professors faced the destruction of their attempts to organize a truly academic research group under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. Now, the People's Government provides educational workers with all the convenience and conditions, so that mental and physical laborers serving in educational institutions (including all professors, lecturers, teaching assistants, faculty, staff, workers, and police in universities and primary and secondary schools) can unite and organize in the same group, and voluntarily and consciously work together to better complete the great task of cultural and educational construction in the New China.

　　(IV) Principles of Industrial Union Organization

　　Organizing educational workers in this way is in line with the organizational principles of industrial unions. Because trade unions should be organized according to industrial departments and systems, and not according to occupations in a single trade. There are two principles for organizing trade unions by industry: first, people working in the same industrial institution, regardless of occupational differences, all join the same trade union. Second, organize nationwide unified trade unions according to industrial departments, such as the National Railway Union, the National Postal and Telecommunications Union, etc. The advantage of industrial unions in capitalist society is that they have more power when fighting against the ruling class, and the workers in a factory, led by a single trade union, can easily act in unison. In the New Democratic and socialist periods, industrial unions also easily organize workers to jointly study production issues and complete the task of developing production.

　　Factories are like this, and schools are like this. To ensure the implementation of the New Democratic cultural and educational policy, run the school well, and complete the educational plan, a school can only do so by having all its staff work together under the leadership of a unified trade union, cooperating with the administrative authorities.

　　(V) Jointly Strive for Cultural Construction

　　Today, with the establishment of the Central People's Government, the nationwide unified economic and cultural construction will soon begin, and nationwide unified economic and cultural construction plans will be formulated. To ensure the implementation of this nationwide construction plan, there must be a unified administrative leadership from the central government from top to bottom and the cooperation of unified trade union organizations working consciously from bottom to top. Therefore, the Beijing education sector's preparation to establish the Beijing Education Workers' Union is of great significance to the education sector and trade union work nationwide. In the future, after the establishment of the National Education Workers' Union, when education workers across the country are united in one organization, millions of education workers, under the leadership of a unified trade union, will ensure the realization of the cultural and educational construction plans formulated by the Cultural and Educational Committee and the Ministry of Education, and set off a climax of cultural construction across the country to complete the great task of transforming a culturally backward China into a culturally advanced China. At that time, we will truly realize what Chairman Mao said: "The era in which Chinese people were regarded as uncivilized has passed. We will appear in the world as a nation with a high degree of culture."

　　谈谈教育工作者工会
    （根据全国总工会副主席李立三在北京院校教职员代表大会上的报告写成）
　　（一）组织起来
    现在，组织教育工作者工会，包括脑力劳动者如教授、讲助教、教员、职员和体力劳动者如工友、校警等，是完全有必要与可能的了。
    新民主主义政权建立了起来，要依靠有组织的群众来加强与巩固它，要求新民主主义政权下的四个朋友——工人阶级，农民阶级，小资产阶级，民族资产阶级都组织起来。首先要求作为领导阶级的工人阶级完全组织起来。因为只有组织起来，才能发挥更大的力量，完成建设新中国的巨大历史任务。
　　（二）教育工作者是工人阶级中的一部分
    就工人阶级的广义来讲，凡是靠工资薪水作为生活来源的劳动者，不管是体力劳动者也好或脑力劳动者也好，都是属于工人阶级范畴的。教育工作者包括教授、讲助教、教员、职员等，他们和工警一样，都是靠工资薪水来维持生活，都是雇佣劳动者，即都是属于工人阶级的。因为工人阶级也和其他阶级一样，是有许多阶层的。其中产业工人是工人阶级的基本阶层；因为他们在旧社会中最受压迫剥削，因而是最富于革命性，而且是最坚决，最彻底的，同时它受过工厂的锻炼，也就是最有组织性的。其他如商店店员，手工业工人，以及脑力劳动者包括教授、工程师等等，虽然生活方式与思想意识与产业工人有不同，但他们是依靠薪水来维持生活的劳动者，所以他们也是属于工人阶级。
    但属于工人阶级并不等于就是工人。教授和工程师等都是工人阶级中的一个阶层，他们的个人成份依然是教授和工程师或统称之为职员成份，而不是工人。正如有些出卖自己生产品的手工业者，如自制皮鞋出卖的皮鞋匠，一般习惯都叫他们做工人而实质上他们是属于小资产阶级，而不是属于雇佣劳动者，即不是属于工人阶级。
    因此又牵涉到另一个问题：家庭出身和个人身份的不同。一位大学教授的家庭出身可能是地主或资产阶级，但只要他的生活主要来源是薪水而不是仰赖家庭，则他依然是一个薪水劳动者。当然他的家庭出身，他的社会环境，必然要影响到他的思想意识，所以处在雇佣劳动者地位的知识分子，其思想意识及生活方式常常是资产阶级或小资产阶级式的，因而常常发生轻视工人，轻视体力劳动者的心理。把知识分子叫做资产阶级或小资产阶级知识分子就是这个原因。
　　（三）打破体力劳动和脑力劳动的对立
    体力劳动与脑力劳动的分别、分裂、对立甚至对抗，这是历史的产物。在原始时代的人类劳动是处于低级状态。那时没有所谓体力劳动和脑力劳动的分别。人类历史愈往前发展，社会劳动有了分工，社会上产生了阶级以后，体力和脑力劳动的分化和对立就日益明显起来。“孟子”上有所谓“劳心者治人，劳力者治于人”的说法，这表明知识文化成了统治阶级的垄断品，被统治阶级是被剥夺享受知识文化的权利的。可见体力劳动和脑力劳动的对立与阶级对立相符合了，也可见得体力劳动和脑力劳动的分裂和对立是阶级社会的产物。到了资本主义时期，一方面由于工业生产的需要，提高了一部分技术工人的知识水平，但是脑力劳动和体力劳动的分裂和对立是更加尖锐了。
    工人成了机器的附属品，终年只做某一种极简单的劳动，使人成为畸形的人。工程师又只知道图样和数目字，他们与工人共同来制造同样的物品，只是资本家用雇佣的强迫的关系把他们连结起来的。只有在社会主义的苏联消灭一切压迫剥削之后，体力劳动者和脑力劳动者都同是为人民服务的人，才自觉地紧密地结合起来，为同一的目的而奋斗。这种自觉自愿的劳动就创造出惊人的成绩，创造出常常远超过一般资本主义工业的生产纪录。这就是为什么苏联能以三个五年计划（其实只有十三年）赶上并且超过原来比沙皇俄国先进五十年至一百年的德国和英国的原因。现时在苏联，体力劳动和脑力劳动的对立已在逐渐消灭中，工人阶级的文化水平是大大提高了，知识分子几乎全部都是工人和农民出身的知识分子了，政治地位和社会地位更完全是一样的了。体力劳动与脑力劳动的差别是大大缩小了，但还没有完全消除，这只有到了共产主义社会，才能把这两者完全统一起来。因此从最初的劳动不分体力和脑力的低级状态，进到阶级社会两者的分裂以至尖锐对立，最后到共产主义社会又统一为一——但这已是最高的统一，这正是体现了辩证法的否定的否定之发展规律的。
    所以，体力和脑力劳动对立的消灭是社会发展必然的趋势，而资本主义在某些方面也为我们准备好了条件，它把大部分的脑力劳动者变成雇佣劳动者和被剥削者，使他们与体力劳动者利害一致，因此在工人运动史上，早就有了脑力劳动者和体力劳动者团结和组织在一起，为反抗资本家的残酷剥削而斗争的事实。
    今天中国的社会是新民主主义的社会，是过渡到社会主义的一个阶段。我们的目的也是要逐渐消灭阻碍社会进步的体力劳动和脑力劳动的对立，使两者自觉自愿地紧密结合起来提高社会的生产和文化，推动社会更快地向前进展。
    现在我们是有这种可能来这样做了。回想到过去，就教育界来说吧，连各大学的教授们要组织一个真正学术研究团体，也要横遭国民党反动统治的摧残。而现在，人民政府给教育工作者以一切的方便与条件，使在教育机关服务的（包括大中小学所有的教授、讲助教、教员、职员和工警等）脑力劳动者和体力劳动者都可能团结起来，组织在同一团体里面，自愿自觉地共同工作，这样来更好地完成新中国文教建设的巨大任务。
　　（四）产业工会组织的原则
    教育工作者这样组织起来是合乎产业工会的组织原则的。因为工会是要按照产业部门和系统来组织，而不应按照一行一业的职业来组织。所谓按产业组织工会有两个原则：第一，同在一个产业机关中工作的人，不管什么职业的差别，统统加入同一个工会。第二，按照产业部门组织全国性的统一的工会，如全国铁路工会，全国邮电工会等等。产业工会的优点，在资本主义社会中，在向统治阶级作斗争时更有力量，一个工厂的工人，受一个工会的领导，行动容易一致。在新民主主义和社会主义时期，产业工会也容易组织工人来共同研究生产问题，完成发展生产的任务。
    工厂是如此，学校也是如此。一个学校要保证贯彻新民主主义的文化教育方针，办好学校，完成实现教育计划，也只有全校工作人员在一个统一的工会领导下，配合行政当局合力进行，才能做到。
　　（五）共同为文化建设而努力
    在中央人民政府已经成立的今天，在全国范围内即将开始进行全国统一性的经济和文化建设，制订全国统一的经济及文化建设计划。要保证执行此项全国建设计划，必须有自上而下的中央政府统一的行政领导和统一的工会组织自下而上的自觉工作的配合。因此北京教育界筹备成立北京教育工作者工会，对于全国教育界和工会工作都是有重大意义的。在将来成立了全国教育工作者工会以后，全国教育工作者都团结在一个组织中以后，那时成百万的教育工作者在一个统一的工会领导下，保证实现文化教育委员会和教育部所拟订的文教建设计划，在全国掀起一个文化建设的高潮，来完成使一个文化落后的中国，变成一个文化先进的中国的巨大任务，那时便能真正实现毛主席所说的“中国人被人认为不文明的时代已经过去了，我们将以一个具有高度文化的民族出现于世界”。
