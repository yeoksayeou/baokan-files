Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 3rd: A TASS dispatch from Rome reports: The Gasperi government's police, on October 30th, in the vicinity of Crotona in the province of Batanzaro in the Calabria region of southern Italy, committed a bloody atrocity by shooting starving landless peasants and farmhands who were opening up the landlords' wasteland. This has aroused great indignation and strong protest from the Italian working people. In this atrocity, the police killed fifteen-year-old Pitto and the farmhand Nide. Four others are in critical condition. This new bloody atrocity is even more brutal and inhuman than the countless atrocities of the police against the working people that have been debated in the recent parliament. Therefore, it has deeply angered the Italian working masses and the people of the whole country. The Secretariat of the Italian General Confederation of Labor and the members of the Executive Committee in Rome held an emergency meeting on the 31st, calling on the working people of the whole country to hold an eight-hour protest general strike. At the same time, the leading body of the General Confederation of Labor sent telegrams to Prime Minister Gasperi, Interior Minister Scelba, and Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Segni, lodging a strong protest.

The General Confederation of Labor's call for a protest strike was immediately met with an enthusiastic response from the working people. On the afternoon of the 1st, urban transportation in Rome and other cities was cut off. At the same time, mass protest rallies were held in many cities. The Secretariat of the Italian Communist Youth League passed a resolution condemning this bloody atrocity by the police.
