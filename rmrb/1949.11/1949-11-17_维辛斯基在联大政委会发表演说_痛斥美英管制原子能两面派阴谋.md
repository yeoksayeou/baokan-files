Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 16th: TASS, New York, 12th: Vyshinsky, head of the Soviet delegation to the United Nations General Assembly, delivered a speech on November 10 at the Special Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly on the issue of international control of atomic energy, sharply exposing the two-faced conspiracy of the United States and Britain in international control of atomic energy.

　　　　US and Britain Sabotage UN General Assembly Resolution
Vyshinsky began his speech by saying that our agenda includes the report of the Atomic Energy Commission, which discusses one of the most important issues brought to the attention of the United Nations. This problem has existed for three years. Such a long time would have been enough to solve this problem. However, this problem remains unsolved. Moreover, it is no closer to being solved now than it was two or three years ago. The fact is that, despite the fact that the United Nations General Assembly has passed several resolutions during this period, clearly expressing the wholehearted desire of the United Nations Organization to solve this problem by prohibiting the use of atomic energy for war purposes and eliminating atomic weapons from national armaments. One must say that all these resolutions are empty declarations, they have no practical significance, and they have been turned into a scrap of paper by the manipulating group within the United Nations.
The Soviet representative urged everyone to pay attention to the fact that the resolution of the United Nations General Assembly on November 4, 1948, regarding consultation among the six permanent member states of the Atomic Energy Commission to determine whether there is a basis for agreement on the international control of atomic energy, in order to ensure the complete use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes, has proven, as the Soviet representative predicted at the time, to be impractical and useless in resolving the deadlock on this important issue. The reason for this should be very clear: five of the six permanent members of the Atomic Energy Commission had already admitted the necessity of completely stopping the work of the Atomic Energy Commission before and when voting on the November 4, 1948 resolution, on the grounds that there was "no way out" and that the Atomic Energy Commission was unable to coordinate the contradictions and differences that occurred in its work.
Vyshinsky went on to say that this behavior of the majority of the Atomic Energy Commission is completely in line with the policy of the US government on the atomic issue expressed in the famous speech of the US President on April 6, 1949, when the US President said that if US interests and world democracy were threatened, he would not hesitate to decide to use the atomic bomb.
Since such a position is taken, it is certainly impossible to hope that the work of the Atomic Energy Commission, which is entrusted with formulating measures to ban atomic weapons, will be successful.
Vyshinsky said: The six permanent members of the committee have now formally stated that they cannot find a basis for resolving their current tasks.

　　　　How did the US-British Group Distort the Facts?
One cannot fail to notice the fact that at the same time as submitting a preliminary report to the General Assembly on consultations among the six permanent members of the Atomic Energy Commission, five members of the commission—the United States, Britain, France, China, and Canada—hurriedly published their statements on these consultations.
In this statement, they deliberately cited the content of the differences between the Soviet Union and the other five permanent members of the commission, and distorted the Soviet Union's position, portraying it as if it were an obstacle to reaching an agreement.
They said that the Soviet government "is unwilling to take steps that might harm or hinder the Soviet Union from strictly exercising its full sovereignty." This is a slanderous accusation against the Soviet government.
In these so-called "conclusions," every word is a distortion, alteration, or fabrication of the facts.
Vyshinsky said: The Soviet delegation's refusal to accept a plan that would place the fate of any country and its economic and political independence under the will and arbitrary control of a so-called international control organization is described by the respectable representatives of the five countries as a rejection of international cooperation and opposition to international control of atomic energy.
In the so-called consultations, the five countries stubbornly insisted on passing the notorious "Baruch Plan," which, as is well known, was drafted as early as 1946, and was severely criticized by several prominent atomic scientists two years ago, scientists who, in any case, were not only not suspected of believing in communism, but were even completely unrelated to communism.
Vyshinsky pointed out: Honestly, some people are making some efforts to cover up the flaws in this plan, and to replace some too despicable and shameless words with other less hateful and less crude words.
Vyshinsky pointed out that in order to conceal this too blatant dream of US imperialism interfering in all atomic production and directing all activities in the world on atomic production at their own will, the five countries attempted to euphemize the words in the Atomic Energy Commission's report regarding the notorious right of ownership of the so-called international control organization. They aim to disguise themselves with this purpose: they want to replace the words that the international control organization owns atomic raw materials and atomic factories with the words "ownership acquired by purchase" or "rights of distribution acquired by purchase."
However, this change is purely literal, and the essence of the matter has not changed in the slightest.

　　　　The United States Attempts to Use its Control Plan to Conceal its Refusal to Ban Atomic Weapons
From this, it can be concluded that the so-called international control plan of the United States remains exactly the same as the plan of three years ago, which has many fundamental shortcomings (which the drafters of the American plan themselves know very well), and therefore, this plan is destined to fail.
The question arises: then, how can one explain the stubbornness of the US-British majority in the Atomic Energy Commission in supporting this plan? We have already heard, and there are also words from authoritative figures and atomic energy experts, who say that this crazy plan was specially designed to hinder the establishment of any control. We have heard—people can judge from the American and British newspapers, at least from some parts of these newspapers, what we have heard—that this plan is just a chess move.
Critics of this plan among atomic scientists have now stated directly that the reason for coming up with this plan is to use the fact that the plan is rejected as an excuse to create a noisy anti-Soviet movement, condemning the Soviet Union for taking a negative attitude towards the plan, saying that the Soviet Union is the only obstacle to achieving world peace. Now, especially after the statement made by TASS on September 25 of this year, you all know the undeniable facts expressed in this statement, and those who accuse the American plan—and there are more and more of them—are increasingly revealing what kind of situation has been behind this American plan recently. Critics of the American plan point out that the drafters of the plan saw "a very significant victory for American diplomacy" in this plan. Although this plan is unacceptable to some countries (this cannot be ignored), everyone knows that it enjoys the full support of representatives of the American upper class. Let us recall the recent words of the US President, who said that this plan is "the only plan that meets the technical needs of atomic energy control and makes the prohibition of atomic weapons effective, and at the same time, it is the only plan that helps the peaceful development of atomic energy on the basis of cooperation." From these words, we can say that the drafters of the American plan, who have publicly stated in the newspapers that they do not intend to use this plan as a basis for solving the problem of banning atomic weapons, have sufficient grounds.
On this point, the illusion that the United States has a monopoly on the manufacture of atomic bombs certainly plays its role in the American ruling group. This illusion was particularly prevalent in 1946, the year the "Baruch Plan" was drafted, and this plan still continues to dominate the minds of these ruling group figures. The American press openly claimed that at that time, it was expected that this monopoly would last for at least several years. This assumption greatly influenced the nature of the so-called international control plan of the United States.
In any case, it is very interesting to mention a passage from an article in the magazine "New Republic," which says: "The concept of monopoly explains the meaning of the stage, and its principle is stipulated in the statement published by Truman, Attlee, and King on November 15, 1945." This is correct. But this is also true for other major characteristics of the American plan. The illusion of the American atomic bomb monopoly prompted the American ruling group to come up with this plan, that is, if some kind of international control is finally established, it can ensure the elimination of all other countries' competition in atomic weapons. But, as is well known, the illusion has been shattered, and the facts remain. Now everyone is very clear: the American atomic weapons monopoly has been hopelessly lost. At the same time, it is also very clear that other countries also have atomic bombs.

　　　　Our Differences
Vyshinsky continued: The main principle on which the entire so-called American plan is based is stated in the five-nation statement: "The five countries remain convinced... that for the sake of security, the international control organization itself must operate and manage dangerous equipment, and must hold dangerous atomic raw materials and the equipment needed to manufacture and use dangerous quantities of such materials by purchasing them on behalf of the member states." As I have already said, the words "purchase" and various statements about "purchase" have not changed the nature of things, because according to this plan, the international control organization actually enjoys ownership.
This should be explained by the speech of the American representative Osborn at the 48th meeting of the Atomic Energy Commission on July 9, 1948, when he was answering the third question raised by the Soviet representative, he said: "The international control organization should have the right to arbitrarily dispose of all sources of atomic raw materials, nuclear fuels and dangerous equipment entrusted to it by the participating countries, and the participating countries have no right to enjoy the ownership of atomic resources and atomic raw materials in their territories or to make any decisions on these resources and materials."
Vyshinsky said: In a brief summary of the control plan proposed by the majority in the Atomic Energy Commission (recorded in the Security Council's report on May 17, 1948), it directly pointed out that "the development and utilization of atomic energy is not actually a domestic issue of individual countries, but is mainly an issue of international importance and influence."
Vyshinsky pointed out: Of course, this entire plan cannot withstand any criticism. If we propose the last point about the development and utilization of atomic energy not actually being a domestic issue of individual countries, it can be refuted by the facts that have already occurred in our country, although it has been relatively short (only a few years), our atomic energy is indeed and truly and on a scale and in the sense of economic effect importantly used to promote the interests of peaceful construction. Therefore, saying that the development and utilization of atomic energy is no longer a domestic affair of countries is not in line with the actual situation, although no one can deny that the issue of atomic weapons has international significance.
The American plan even stipulates that chemical and steel factories should also be handed over to the international control organization, on the pretext that during the manufacturing stage, the hidden danger will be greater than in the previous stages.
The American plan is unscrupulous. It openly demands that this international organization be recognized as having the right to interfere in any aspect of the economic life of any country. I ask you to note that it includes not only this aspect, which is to some extent related to atomic production, but also any aspect.

### 维辛斯基在联大政委会发表演说　痛斥美英管制原子能两面派阴谋

　　维辛斯基在联大政委会发表演说
  　痛斥美英管制原子能两面派阴谋
    【新华社北京十六日电】塔斯社纽约十二日讯：苏联出席联合国大会代表团团长维辛斯基十一月十日在联合国大会特别政治委员会会议上，就国际管制原子能问题发表演说，尖锐揭发美英对原子能国际管制的两面派阴谋。
    　　　　美英破坏联合国大会决议
    维辛斯基开始发言说，我们的议程上有原子能委员会的报告，论述引起联合国注意的最重要问题之一。这个问题存在已有三年之久了。这样长的时间本来是足够来解决这个问题的。然而这个问题仍然没有解决。而且，目前比起两三年以前来，丝毫也没有更接近于解决。事实确是如此，尽管联合国大会在这一时期内曾通过几次决议，明确表示联合国组织全心全意地愿望以禁止原子能用于战争目的，并消除国家军备中的原子武器的方式来解决这个问题。人们一定要说，所有这些决议都是空空洞洞的宣言，它们没有实际意义，它们已经被联合国内的操纵集团弄成一团废纸了。
    苏联代表促请大家注意：联合国大会一九四八年十一月四日关于由原子能委员会六个常任委员国协商决定原子能国际管制上是否存在协议的基础，以保证实现原子能完全用于和平目的的决议，正如苏联代表当时所预言的，已经证明对于消除这个重要问题的僵局是毫不实际而且无用的。其原因应该是很明白的：原子能委员会六个常任委员里有五个委员国事先以及在表决一九四八年十一月四日决议时，就已经承认原子能委员会工作全部停止的必要性，他们的理由是“没有出路”以及原子能委员会没有能力来协调工作中所发生的矛盾和分歧。
    维辛斯基接着说，原子能委员会多数派的这种行为，是与美国总统在一九四九年四月六日的著名演说中所表示的美国政府在原子问题上的政策完全符合的，美国总统当时说，如果美国利益和世界民主遭受威胁时，他将毫不犹豫地决定使用原子弹。
    既然采取这种立场，当然就不可希望这个受托拟出禁用原子武器措施的原子能委员会的工作会获得成功。
    维辛斯基说：委员会的六个常任委员现在已正式声明，找不到解决他们当前的任务之基础。
    　　　　美英集团是怎样歪曲事实的？
    人们不能不注意到这一事实：和向联大提出关于在原子能委员会六个常任委员之间的协商之初步报告同时，该委员会的五个委员——美国、英国、法国、中国和加拿大——竟匆忙发表了他们对这些协商的声明。
    在这个声明中，他们帮意举出苏联与该委员会的其他五个常任委员间所发生的分歧之内容，并歪曲苏联的立场，把苏联的立场描绘得仿佛就是达到协议的障碍。
    他们说苏联政府“不愿采取可能损害或阻挠苏联严格行使其充分主权的步骤”。这是毁谤地诿过于苏联政府。
    在这些“结论”里，每个字都是对事实的歪曲、窜改，或捏造。
    维辛斯基说；苏联代表团拒绝接受把任何国家的命运及其经济、政治的独立，置于所谓国际管制机构的意志与独断支配之下的计划，便被可敬的五国代表们描写为拒绝国际合作，反对国际管制原子能了。
    在所谓协商当中，五国执拗地硬要通过臭名远播的“巴鲁区计划”，如所周知，这计划是远在一九四六年就拟订出来的，而且是在两年以前曾被若干卓越的原子科学家严正地痛斥过，被那些无论怎样说都不仅没有信仰共产主义的嫌疑，而且甚至与共产主义毫不相干的科学家严正地痛斥过的。
    维辛斯基指出：老实说，有些人正在作某种努力来掩盖这一计划的马脚，并以其他一切不太可憎，不太粗野的字眼来代替某些过于卑鄙无耻的字眼。
    维辛斯基指出，为了遮掩这一太露骨的梦想，即美帝国主义染指全部原子生产，并随他们自己的心意指挥全世界在原子生产上的一切活动，五国便企图把原子能委员会报告中的话说得委婉一些，这报告是谈到所谓国际管制机构的所有权这一臭名远扬的权利的。他们抱着这样的目的来进行伪装：他们想以“由购买而获得所有权”或“由购买而获得分配权”的字样代替国际管制机构拥有原子原料与原子工厂的所有权的字样。
    然而，这种改变纯粹是字面上的，事情的本质丝毫也没有改变。
    　　　　美国企图利用其管制计划来掩饰拒绝禁止原子武器
    从这里可以得出这样的结论：美国的所谓国际管制的计划，依然是和三年前的那个计划一模一样，这计划有着许多根本的缺点（这些缺点是美国计划的拟订者自己也知道得清清楚楚的），因之，这个计划便注定了要失败。
    问题便发生了：那么，人们又怎能解释美英多数在原子能委员会里支持这个计划的那一股子执拗的劲头呢？我们早已经听见过，而且这里面还有权威人物和原子能专家说的话，他们说：这个疯狂的计划正是专为妨碍建立任何管制而拟定出来的。我们已经听见过——人们可以从美国与英国的报纸来判断，最低限度也能用这些报纸的某些部分来判断我们所听见的这些话——这计划只不过是棋局中的一着罢了。
    原子科学家之中批评这个计划的人现在已经直截了当地说：所以要想出这个计划来，就是打算在这个计划被拒绝之后，利用计划被拒绝的事实，来作喧嚷的反苏运动的借口，谴责苏联对这计划采取否定态度，说什么苏联是获致世界和平唯一的障碍。现在，特别是在塔斯社本年九月二十五日所作的声明后，你们大家全都晓得这声明中表示了那种无可争辩的事实，责备美国计划的人——这种人是越来越多了——越来越揭露了在这个美国计划的幕后近来是怎样一种情形。批评美国计划的人们指出：计划的拟订者从这个计划中看见“美国外交得到了非常重大的胜利”。尽管这个计划是若干国家所不能接受的（这是不能被漠视的），然而，大家都晓得它享有美国上层阶级代表底全力支持。让我们回想美国总统最近说的话罢，他说：这计划是“适应原子能管制的技术需要和使禁止原子武器生效的唯一计划，同时又是在合作基础上帮助原子能和平发展的唯一计划”。从这些话看来我们可以说，报纸上所公开表示的美国计划的拟订者，根本并不打算以这个计划作为解决禁用原子武器问题的基础，是有充分根据的。
    在这一点上，美国统治集团以为美国已握有原子弹制造的垄断大权的这种幻想，当然是起着它的作用的。这种幻想在一九四六年，也就是在“巴鲁区计划”拟订的那一年特别普遍，这个计划现在还继续支配着这些统治集团人物的头脑。美国报界公开声称，那时候预料这种垄断至少会存在若干年。这种假定在很大的程度上影响着美国所谓国际管制计划的性质。
    无论如何，在这里提起“新共和”杂志一篇文章里的一段话是很有趣味的，这篇文章里说：“垄断的概念说明了阶段的含义，它的原则是规定在杜鲁门、艾德礼和金氏一九四五年十一月十五日所发表的声明里。”这是对的。但是这对于美国计划的其他主要特点来说，也是对的。美国原子弹垄断的幻想曾促使美国统治集团拟出这种计划，即如果终于要建立某种国际管制的话，它能保证消除在原子武器方面的一切其他国家的匹敌。但是，如所周知，幻想已经破灭，而事实却依然存在。现在人人都很清楚：美国原子武器的垄断已经绝望地丧失了。同时人们也很清楚，别的国家也握有原子弹。
    　　　　我们的分歧
    维辛斯基接着说：整个所谓美国计划所根据的主要原则是在于如此提出的五国声明：“五国仍然深信………为保证安全起见，国际管制机构本身必须经营与管理危险的设备，必须以代表会员国家从事购买的方式来握有危险的原子原料以及为制造与使用危险数量的这种原料所需的设备。”正如我已经讲过的，“购买”字样以及关于“购买”的种种说法决没有改变事物的性质，因为依照这个计划，国际管制机构实际上是享有所有权的。
    这应该由美国代表奥斯朋在一九四八年七月九日原子能委员会第四十八次会议上的发言来说明，当时他是在答复苏联代表所提出的第三个问题，他说：“国际管制机构应该有权任意处置参加国所委托给它的一切原子原料、核子燃料及危险设备的来源，参加国没有任何权利享有其领土上的原子资源及原子原料的所有权或对于这些资源及原料问题作任何决定”。
    维辛斯基说：在原子能委员会里多数派所提出的管制计划（记载在安理会一九四八年五月十七日的报告里）的简短的总结中，它直接地指出：“原子能的开发和利用，实际上并不是个别国家的国内问题，而主要是具有国际重要性和影响的问题”。
    维辛斯基指出：当然，整个这个计划是经不起任何批评的。如果我们提出其中最后一点关于原子能的开发和利用实际上不是个别国家的国内问题来讲，就可以被已经在我国发生的虽然为时比较地不久（只有几年）的事实来加以驳斥，我国的原子能正在确确实实地并且在规模上和经济作用的意义上都很重要地用来促进和平建设的利益。因之，说原子能的开发和利用已经不再是各国的国内事务是不符合实际情形的，虽然任何人不能否认原子武器问题是具有国际意义的。
    美国的计划甚至规定把化学和钢铁工厂也交给国际管制机构所有，它的借口是：在制造阶段内，隐藏的危险将比它以前的几个阶段更大。
    美国的计划是肆无忌惮的。它公开要求承认这个国际机构有权干涉任何国家的任何方面的经济生活。我请诸位注意，它不仅包括与原子生产有某种程度上联系的这一方面，而且包括任何方面。
