Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 11th: According to a TASS dispatch from New York: The Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, after the conclusion of the work of the Seventeenth Subcommittee examining the question of former Italian colonies, resumed general debate on this issue on the 7th.

    In the committee, Soviet representative Arutyunyan spoke, criticizing the majority group's proposals in the subcommittee, and exposing the colonial countries, primarily the United States and Britain, for their attempts to divide the former Italian colonies.

    He said: The Political Committee has two proposals before it: First, the proposal of the majority group of the subcommittee, in which the majority group itself also has serious differences on individual basic points; second, the proposal of the Soviet delegation, which has the full support of the delegations of Poland, Czechoslovakia, Ukraine, and Byelorussia, and some other countries also agree with its basic points. These two drafts reflect two policies for resolving the question of former Italian colonies: the proposal of the majority group of the subcommittee attempts to divide the former Italian colonies; the proposal of the Soviet delegation respects the principle of self-determination of the people of the former Italian colonies, while safeguarding the overall common interests of the United Nations.

    The draft of the majority group of the subcommittee is a compromise between colonial countries, who are trying to collude with each other to divide the former Italian colonies. Wherever they have failed to reach agreement among themselves, they have left it unresolved or delayed the solution. The situation in resolving the problems of Eritrea and Somaliland is an example of this. The Bevin-Sforza secret agreement concluded in May of this year is the basis for compromise between colonial countries. This compromise based on the Bevin-Sforza secret agreement is to ensure the political and military strategic interests of the colonial countries, at the expense of the interests of the people of the former Italian colonies, and at the expense of the overall common interests of the United Nations.

    联大讨论前意殖民地问题
    苏建议保证各地独立
    坚决反对美英集团瓜分阴谋
    【新华社北京十一日电】据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会政治委员会，在审查意大利前殖民地问题提案的第十七小组委员会工作告一段落之后，于七日恢复了对这一问题的一般辩论。
    在委员会上，苏联代表亚鲁疆发言，批评多数集团在小组委员会上所提出的提案，并揭露殖民国家首先是美国和英国，瓜分前意大利殖民地的企图。
    他说：政治委员会面前有两个提案：第一，是小组委员会多数集团的提案，其中，多数集团内部在个别基本点上也有严重分歧；第二，是苏联代表团的提案，它得到波、捷、乌克兰、白俄罗斯代表团的完全支持，还有一些其他国家的代表团也同意它的基本点。这两个草案反映解决前意大利殖民地问题的两种政策：小组委员会多数集团的提案，力图瓜分前意大利殖民地；苏联代表团的提案，则尊重意大利前殖民地人民自决权的原则，同时维护联合国总的共同利益。
    小组委员会多数集团的草案，是殖民国家之间的妥协，他们设法互相勾结以瓜分前意大利殖民地。凡是他们自己之间未能获得协议的地方，他们就悬而不决或拖延解决。解决厄立特里亚和索马利兰问题的情形就是如此。今年五月缔结的贝文——史佛卓秘密协定，是殖民国家之间妥协的基础。这一基于贝文——史佛卓秘密协定的妥协，是为了保证殖民国家的政治和军事战略利益，而牺牲前意大利殖民地人民的利益，牺牲联合国总的共同利益的。
