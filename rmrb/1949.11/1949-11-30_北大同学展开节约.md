　　Since Peking University launched its economy drive in April, it had achieved significant results in April, May, and June. However, starting in July, the monthly consumption of electricity and coal water gradually increased. The consumption in the Sand Beach area in October was more than double that of August. The electricity consumption of the College of Engineering accounted for 51% of the total administrative expenses, with a monthly water consumption of 900 metric tons. Female students in the Gray Building in the Sand Beach area consumed over 1,000 metric tons of water in a month. The Red Building used 6 tons of coal in September, and the West Single Dormitory used 8 tons of coal in October. Apart from the expenses for water, coal, and electricity, the administrative expenses had no way to add other things. In order to conserve electricity and coal water expenses, students recently launched an economy drive on their own initiative. Fourth-year students in the Electrical Engineering Department of the College of Engineering combined the desks of three people together in the evening, sharing one lamp, going to bed early and getting up early, and shortening the use of electricity as much as possible. Street lights in various places have also been reduced. Students from other departments called on everyone to save water as much as possible when washing their faces, reducing water consumption to a maximum.

　　北大同学展开节约
    【本报讯】北京大学自四月份展开节约运动以后，在四、五、六三个月中。曾获得显著的成绩，但从七月起每个月用电和煤水的消耗量又逐渐增大。沙滩区十月份的消耗量竟达八月份的一倍以上，工学院电消耗量占全部行政费百分之五十一，每月消耗水量九百公吨，沙滩区灰楼女同学一个月消耗水一千多公吨，红楼九月份用煤六吨，西单宿舍十月份用煤八吨。行政费除了水煤电的开支以外，即没有办法添置别的东西。为了节用电和煤水开支，最近同学们又自动发起展开节约运动。工学院电机系四年级同学晚上把三个人的桌子合并在一起，共用一灯，早睡早起，尽量把用电的时间缩短，各处路灯也已减少，其他各系同学号召大家洗脸尽量节约用水，使用水的消耗量减低至最大限度。
