　　The October Socialist Revolution and the Chinese Revolution
    Chen Boda

    The influence of the October Socialist Revolution on the Chinese Revolution is extremely broad and profound. It caused tremendous changes in the thinking of the Chinese people and influenced the entire course of Chinese history. It is impossible to discuss the many aspects of this issue in detail in this short article. Here, I only want to briefly talk about one of the most important issues regarding the October Revolution's impact on the Chinese Revolution, which is the establishment of the Chinese Communist Party.

    The Chinese Communist Party is the party of the Chinese working class, the vanguard of the working class. The emergence of this party is the inevitable result of the development of China's large-scale industry. When commenting on Sun Yat-sen's doctrine during the Xinhai Revolution, Lenin already foresaw that a working-class party would soon emerge in China. Lenin made this prediction according to the laws of historical development. However, we need to know that our Chinese working-class party was born after the October Socialist Revolution, in the era of proletarian revolution of Lenin and Stalin. This makes the establishment of the Chinese working-class party different from the development history of working-class parties in European countries (or most European countries). This difference, fundamentally speaking, is what Comrade Mao Zedong and Comrade Liu Shaoqi often mentioned: our party was built according to the Bolshevik model of Lenin and Stalin, and does not have the tradition of social democracy.

    Comrade Mao Zedong said in "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship": "The Chinese found Marxism through the introduction of the Russians. Before the October Revolution, the Chinese not only did not know Lenin and Stalin, but also did not know Marx and Engels. The salvo of the October Revolution brought us Marxism-Leninism." The Marxism introduced to the Chinese by the October Revolution was the revolutionary Marxism restored and developed by Lenin and Stalin, that is, Bolshevism. This Bolshevism was forged in the long-term struggle against social democracy, which betrayed Marxism, advocated social reform, opposed social revolution, and cooperated with imperialism, and is the complete opposite of social democracy.

    Comrade Liu Shaoqi once wrote the following conditions for the emergence of our party in his article "On Inner-Party Struggle" in 1941: "First, the construction of the Chinese Party was after the October Revolution, after the Russian Bolsheviks had already achieved victory and had a living example. Therefore, from the beginning, it was under the guidance of the Communist International, and construction was carried out according to Lenin's principles. Second, from the beginning to the present, the Chinese Party has not been influenced ideologically and organizationally by the Second International of European Social Democratic Parties. Third, China did not have a period of 'peaceful development' of capitalism like Europe, allowing the working class to have peaceful parliamentary struggles, nor did it have a working-class aristocracy like Europe." The initial combination of the Chinese working-class party with Bolshevism has placed our party and the cause of our party leading the Chinese revolution forward in an extremely advantageous position.

    The Chinese working-class party has no tradition of social democracy, which also means that the Chinese workers' movement has no tradition of social democracy. The vast Chinese workers' movement developed under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. Therefore, the vast Chinese working masses only believe in the Chinese Communist Party. The Chinese Communist Party's prestige among the working class is absolute, and this prestige is the prestige of Bolshevism. There was a small group of anarchists in China who once spread their influence among a small portion of workers in Guangzhou, but because those anarchists were the running dogs of the comprador big bourgeoisie, and they were actually counter-revolutionary, their influence was only because they used backward relationships to do some deceptive work there first.

    Of course, we cannot portray the development of our party as so "pure." It would not be in accordance with the facts to do such a portrayal. It is a fact that our Chinese workers' movement does not have the tradition of social democracy, nor does it have the great influence of anarchism and syndicalism. But because of this, there are quite a few petty-bourgeois or bourgeois elements with ideological trends that are essentially or similar to social democracy, anarchism, syndicalism, and other petty-bourgeois or bourgeois ideas. They do not separately organize their own political factions, but bring their own ideas into our party. They are nominally Communist Party members, but they work according to their original ideas. It should be pointed out that the majority of them who sincerely want revolution have constantly tempered and transformed themselves in the long-term revolutionary flames, and finally abandoned their original erroneous things and accepted Bolshevism. Many of these comrades have been proven to be good. Of course, there are also a few people who insist on their own erroneous things to oppose Bolshevism. For example, Chen Duxiu and Zhang Guotao, who once infiltrated the party, are the most prominent representatives of persistent anti-Marxist, anti-Bolshevik, and reactionary ideas. They once hindered the progress of the Chinese revolution in the revolutionary ranks. But due to the infinite prestige of Lenin and Stalin's Bolshevism within the Chinese Party, they quickly declared their bankruptcy among the party masses and the masses outside the party. Some, like Chen Duxiu, became despicable and degenerate counter-revolutionary Trotskyists and became running dogs of imperialist fascists; others, like Zhang Guotao, openly ran into the Kuomintang secret service to carry out despicable and degenerate counter-revolutionary work.

    Avoiding the tradition of social democracy and building the Chinese working-class party according to the principles of Lenin and Stalin's Bolshevism is the most concentrated and fundamental influence that the October Revolution gave to the Chinese Revolution. This influence determined the fate of the Chinese Revolution. As everyone knows, the victory of the Chinese people's revolution is the result of the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong and the assistance of various international revolutionary forces in different ways. Without the leadership of this party, the Chinese people would not have been able to liberate themselves from the oppression of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. But the reason why this party can lead the revolution all the way to victory is because this party accepted Lenin and Stalin's Bolshevism and carried out the Chinese revolution in accordance with the needs of the Chinese people and the characteristics of China.

    Based on Lenin and Stalin's Bolshevism, the Chinese Communist Party determined a most fundamental viewpoint regarding the Chinese Revolution, that is, the Chinese Revolution must be led by the Chinese working class and cannot be led by other classes. Comrade Mao Zedong applied Lenin and Stalin's Bolshevism and, on the two interrelated issues of the leadership of the Chinese proletariat and the united front of the people's revolution, formulated a famous formula: a revolution led by the proletariat, based on the worker-peasant alliance, of the masses of the people, against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism.

    At the same time, based on the revolutionary spirit of Lenin and Stalin's Bolshevism, and in accordance with China's conditions, the Chinese Communist Party insisted on the concept of armed revolution, especially in accordance with China's characteristics, and determined the concept of the working class leading the peasant war as an armed revolution. Comrade Mao Zedong often explained the correct proposition put forward by Comrade Stalin in 1926 regarding the Chinese Revolution: "Armed revolution against armed counter-revolution is the characteristic and advantage of the Chinese Revolution."

    The people rising up in armed struggle to overthrow their oppressors has been a revolutionary tradition in China for more than two thousand years, either on a national scale or on a local scale, repeated hundreds of times in varying degrees. This kind of people's armed struggle is the peasant war. This armed struggle is carried out by first igniting the countryside, then seizing the enemy's positions piece by piece, from seizing the enemy's positions in the countryside to seizing the enemy's positions in the cities. From some superficial perspectives, the development and victory of the Chinese people's revolutionary war over the past two decades has also advanced according to such struggle experience. However, in reality, not only are the content of our struggle and the goals we pursue completely new, completely different from the old-style peasant wars, and completely different from the revolutions led by the bourgeoisie, but also our struggle methods and organizational forms are completely new. In the early days of leading the revolutionary war, Comrade Mao Zedong had already waged an uncompromising struggle against the roving rebel nature of the old-style peasant wars in the strictest way. Our people's liberation war over the past two decades has been an armed struggle of the masses of the people (mainly the peasant masses) under the leadership of the proletariat. The most fundamental thing here is the leadership of the proletariat, and the so-called leadership of the proletariat is the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the leadership of Bolshevism. This kind of leadership determines the present of the Chinese Revolution and also determines the future of the Chinese Revolution.

    It is absolutely necessary to pay attention to the traditional struggle experience of the Chinese people. However, we know that we must use the viewpoints and methods of Marxism-Leninism, the viewpoints and methods of Bolshevism, to deal with these revolutionary traditions, to deal with these struggle experiences, to negate their original erroneous things, and to raise what can still be adopted to the level of revolutionary science, to the level of the modern working-class struggle. Otherwise, these traditional struggle experiences cannot be useful in the context of modern China.

    There is no doubt that our People's Liberation War is entirely a new type, a revolutionary war belonging to the Bolshevik type; our People's Great Revolution is a revolution belonging to the Bolshevik type. Only through the Chinese Bolsheviks headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, constantly fighting against all kinds of anti-Bolshevik ideological trends, can our new democratic revolution continue to advance, achieve victory, and open up our path from new democracy to socialism and the Great Harmony of the world. Mao Zedong Thought is Bolshevism combined with the reality of the Chinese revolution and the characteristics of the Chinese revolution.

    Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Without a revolutionary party established according to the revolutionary theory and revolutionary style of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, it is impossible to lead the working class and the broad masses of the people to defeat imperialism and its running dogs." It was the October Socialist Revolution that influenced China and gave birth to such a revolutionary party, and gave birth to the Chinese Bolsheviks represented by Comrade Mao Zedong. This is the key to all problems in the Chinese Revolution, and this is the key to the great transformation of Chinese history.

    Looking at the October Revolution from China, it precisely illustrates what Stalin pointed out in his article commemorating the tenth anniversary of the October Revolution: "The October Revolution is not merely a 'national-scope' revolution. It is first and foremost an international revolution, because it is the fundamental transformation in the history of all mankind from the old world of capitalism to the new world of socialism." "The victory of the October Revolution is a fundamental transformation in the history of mankind, a fundamental transformation in the history of world capitalism, a fundamental transformation in the liberation movement of the world proletariat, and a fundamental transformation in the fighting methods and organizational forms, customs and traditions, culture and ideology of the exploited masses of the world."

    Looking at the October Revolution from China, it also precisely illustrates what Stalin pointed out in his article commemorating the tenth anniversary of the October Revolution: "The October Revolution opened up a new era, that is, the era of colonial revolution in which the oppressed people of the world allied with the proletariat and under the leadership of the proletariat."

    It was precisely under the leadership of the proletariat that the Chinese people embarked on the path pointed out by the October Revolution to overthrow imperialist rule. After many tortuous roads and arduous battles, the Chinese people were victorious. This is the victory of Bolshevism.

    The reason why Bolshevism triumphs is because it is correct science, representing the hope of mankind. It triumphs in Russia, triumphs in Eastern European countries, triumphs in China, and will continue to triumph in one country after another throughout the world, because this revolutionary truth is irresistible to any reactionary force.

    Long live the victory of the great and invincible banner of Lenin and Stalin's Bolshevism! (Originally published in the inaugural issue of the "Sino-Soviet Friendship" monthly magazine) [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 5th dispatch]

　　十月社会主义革命与中国革命
    陈伯达
    十月社会主义革命对中国革命的影响，是极其广阔，极其深远的。它引起了中国人思想的大变化，同时影响了整个中国历史的进程。要详细地论述这个问题的许多方面，在这一篇短文章里，是不可能的。在这里，我只想简单地讲一讲十月革命影响于中国革命的一个最重要的问题，这个问题就是关于中国共产党建立的问题。
    中国共产党是中国工人阶级的政党，是工人阶级的先锋队。这个政党的产生，是中国大工业发展的必然结果。列宁在辛亥革命评论孙中山主义的时候，他已经预见了不久的时间中国会有工人阶级政党的出现。列宁是按照历史发展的规律来提出这个预见的。但是，我们需要知道：我们中国工人阶级的政党是在十月社会主义革命以后所产生的，是在列宁、斯大林的无产阶级革命时代所产生的。这样，就使得中国工人阶级政党的建立，和欧洲国家（或欧洲大多数国家）工人阶级政党的发展历史有了不同点，这个不同点，在根本上说来，就是毛泽东同志和刘少奇同志经常所说到的：我们的党是按照列宁、斯大林的布尔什维主义这一个类型建立起来的，而没有社会民主主义的传统。
    毛泽东同志“论人民民主专政”说：“中国人找到马克思主义，是经过俄国人介绍的。在十月革命以前，中国人不但不知道列宁、斯大林，也不知道马克思、恩格斯。十月革命一声炮响，给我们送来了马克思列宁主义”。十月革命给中国人介绍的马克思主义，即是为列宁、史大林所恢复并加以发展的革命的马克思主义，即是布尔什维主义。这布尔什维主义是在长期中和那种背叛马克思主义、主张社会改良、反对社会革命、并与帝国主义合作的社会民主主义做斗争，而锻炼出来的，是和社会民主主义完全相反的对立物。
    刘少奇同志于一九四一年“论党内斗争”一文里面曾经写过我们党产生的以下条件：“第一、中国党的建设是在十月革命以后，是在俄国布尔什维克已经取得胜利，有了活的榜样以后，所以一开始就是在共产党国际的指导之下，照着列宁的原则去进行建设的。第二、中国党从开始到现在，在思想上和组织上都没有受到欧洲社会民主党第二国际的影响。第三、中国没有欧洲那样的资本主义“和平发展”的时期，容许工人阶级和平的议会斗争，也没有欧洲那样的工人贵族阶级”。中国工人阶级政党一开始就和布尔什维主义相结合，这就使得我们党和我们党领导中国革命前进的事业处在一个极其优越的地位。
    中国工人阶级政党没有社会民主主义的传统，同时也即说明了中国工人运动没有社会民主主义的传统。中国广大工人运动是在中国共产党领导之下发展起来的，因此，中国广大工人群众所相信的，只有中国共产党。中国共产党在工人阶级中的威信是绝对的，这种威信就是布尔什维主义的威信。中国有过一小撮的无政府主义者曾经在广州一小部分的工人当中散布过影响，但是因为那些无政府主义者是买办大资产阶级的走狗，他们实际上是反革命的，他们的影响仅仅是因为他们利用落后的关系，先在那里做了一些欺骗的工作。
    不错，我们不能把我们党的发展描写得那么“纯粹”。如果去做这样的描写，那也是不合事实的。我们中国工人运动没有社会民主主义那个传统，也没有无政府主义、工团主义的很大影响，这是事实。但是也因为这样，就有相当多的小资产阶级或资产阶级的分子带有那种在实质上是或类似社会民主主义、无政府主义、工团主义以及其他的小资产阶级或资产阶级的思想流派，他们并不去另外单独组织自己的政派，而是把他们自己的思想带进到我们党里面来，名义是共产党员，但却按照他自己原来的思想去工作。应该指出：其中大多数真心愿意革命的人，他们在长期的革命烈火中不断地锻炼了和改造了自己，终于放弃了他们原来的错误的东西，而接受布尔什维主义，这许多同志被证明了是好的。当然也有少数人坚持了自己错误的东西，以反对布尔什维主义，例如曾经一度混进到党里面来的陈独秀、张国焘，就是坚持反马克思主义的、反布尔什维主义的、反动思想的最突出的代表，他们曾经在革命队伍里面阻挠了中国革命的前进。但由于列宁、斯大林的布尔什维主义在中国党内的无限威信，他们也就很快地在党内群众中和党外群众中宣告了自己的破产，有的如陈独秀这一类人，就变成了卑鄙下流的反革命的托洛茨基派，当了帝国主义法西斯的走狗；有的如张国焘这一类人，就公开跑进国民党特务机关里面，进行卑鄙下流的反革命工作。
    避免社会民主主义的传统，根据列宁、斯大林的布尔什维主义的原则而建设中国工人阶级的政党，这是十月革命所给予中国革命的最集中的和最根本的影响。这一个影响是决定了中国革命的命运的。正如大家所知道：中国人民革命的胜利，是由于以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党的领导并获得国际革命力量各种不同方式的援助所得到的结果。没有这一个党的领导，中国人民就不可能从帝国主义、封建主义与官僚资本主义的压迫中解放出来。但这个党之所以能够领导革命一直到胜利，就是因为这个党接受了列宁、斯大林的布尔什维主义，并按照中国人民的需要，按照中国的特点，来进行中国的革命。
    中国共产党根据列宁、斯大林的布尔什维主义，确定了关于中国革命的一个最根本的观点，这就是中国革命必须是由中国工人阶级来领导，而不能由别的阶级来领导。毛泽东同志应用了列宁、斯大林的布尔什维主义，而在关于中国无产阶级领导权和人民革命统一战线这两个互相联系的问题上，规定出了一个有名的公式，这就是：无产阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础的、人民大众的、反对帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的革命。
    中国共产党同时又根据列宁、斯大林的布尔什维主义的革命精神，按照中国的条件，坚持了武力革命这一个观念，特别是按照中国的特点，确定了关于工人阶级领导农民战争这一个武力革命观念。毛泽东同志经常说明了斯大林同志在一九二六年关于中国革命所提出的正确的命题：“武装的革命反对武装的反革命，是中国革命的特点和优点。”
    人民用武装斗争的方式起来推翻他们的压迫者，这曾经是中国两千多年来、或是全国规模的、或是地方规模的、反复过大小数百次的革命传统。这种人民的武装斗争就是农民战争。这种武装斗争的进行，先是由乡村燃烧起来，然后一块一块地夺取敌人的阵地，由夺取敌人在乡村的阵地到夺取敌人在城市的阵地。从某些表面来看，二十几年来中国人民革命战争的发展及其胜利，也是按照这样的斗争经验而前进的。但是，在实际上，不但我们斗争的内容及其追求的目的，是完全崭新的，完全区别于旧式的农民战争，完全区别于资产阶级领导的革命，而且我们的斗争方法和组织形式，也是完全崭新的。毛泽东同志在领导革命战争的初期，就已经最严格地和旧式农民战争的流寇主义作了不妥协的斗争。二十几年来我们的人民解放战争是无产阶级领导之下的人民大众（主要是农民大众）的武装斗争。这里最根本的东西，就是无产阶级的领导，而所谓无产阶级的领导，就是中国共产党的领导，就是布尔什维主义的领导，这种领导决定了中国革命的现在，同时也决定了中国革命的将来。
    注意中国人民传统的斗争经验，这是完全必要的。但是，我们知道，我们必须是用马克思列宁主义的观点和方法，用布尔什维主义的观点和方法，来处理这些革命传统，处理这些斗争经验，否定其原来错误的东西，而把还可采取的东西提高到革命科学的水平上来，提高到现代工人阶级斗争的水平上来，否则，这些传统的斗争经验在近代中国的场合，就不能是有用的。
    毫无疑问：我们的人民解放战争完全是属于新型的，是属于布尔什维主义类型的革命战争；我们的人民大革命，是属于布尔什维主义类型的革命。只有经过以毛泽东同志为首的中国布尔什维克，不断地和各色各样反布尔什维主义的思想流派进行斗争，才能使我们的新民主主义革命继续前进，获得了胜利，并开拓了我们由新民主主义走向社会主义与世界大同的道路。毛泽东思想乃是和中国革命实际、中国革命特点相结合的布尔什维主义。
    毛泽东同志说：“没有一个按照马、恩、列、斯的革命理论和革命风格建立起来的革命党，就不可能领导工人阶级及广大人民群众战胜帝国主义及其走狗。”正是十月社会主义革命影响到中国，使我们产生了这样一个革命党，产生了以毛泽东同志为代表的中国布尔什维克。这是中国革命一切问题的关键，这是中国历史大转变的关键。
    从中国来看十月革命，正说明了斯大林在纪念十月革命十周年的文章中所指出的：“十月革命并不是单办‘民族范围内的’革命。它首先就是国际性的革命，因为他是全人类史中资本主义旧世界进到社会主义新世界的根本转变”。“十月革命的胜利是人类史中的根本转变，是世界资本主义历史革命中的根本转变，是世界无产阶级解放运动中的根本转变，是全世界被剥削群众斗争方法和组织形式，风俗和传统，文化和思想体系中的根本转变。”
    从中国来看十月革命，又正说明了斯大林在纪念十月革命十周年的文章中所指出的：“十月革命开辟了一个新时代，即世界各被压迫国人民与无产阶级联盟并在无产阶级领导下进行殖民地革命的时代。”
    中国人民正是在无产阶级的领导下，踏上了十月革命所指出的推翻帝国主义统治的道路。经过了许多曲折的道路和千辛万苦的战斗，中国人民胜利了。这就是布尔什维主义的胜利。
    布尔什维主义的所以胜利，因为它是正确的科学，是代表人类的希望。它在俄国胜利，在东欧各国胜利，在中国胜利，并将继续一国又一国地在全世界胜利，因为这个革命的真理是任何反动势力所不可抵抗的。
    列宁斯大林的布尔什维主义这个伟大无敌的旗帜胜利万岁！（原载“中苏友好”月刊创刊号）【新华社北京五日电】
