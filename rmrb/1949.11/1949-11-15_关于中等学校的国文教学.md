On Chinese Language Teaching in Secondary Schools
    Liu Guoying

    Recently, due to my work, I conducted a survey on "Chinese language teaching in secondary schools." Although the survey wasn't a great success, I did gather some materials. I want to present this as a problem for experts and educators to consider.

  I. Textbook Issues

    According to the survey results, general secondary school students have the following reactions to the existing Chinese language textbooks (published by Xinhua Bookstore, edited by Zhou Jing and Wang Pu): "Too shallow," "Too little classical Chinese," "Too little lyrical prose." Is it really too shallow? Is there really too little lyrical prose? We did some research.

    The first two opinions are basically the same problem. That is to say, the issue with the current Chinese textbooks is not whether they are too difficult or too easy, but simply the amount of classical Chinese and vernacular Chinese. Indeed, if we compare the current Chinese textbooks with those from the Kuomintang era, the amount of classical Chinese has undoubtedly decreased. We won't discuss the value of classical Chinese for the moment. However, we must ask: Why do secondary school students have such a great interest in classical Chinese? Experience tells us that, except for a very small number of students, the vast majority of secondary school students do not like classical Chinese. The reason why current secondary school students demand more classical Chinese is nothing else; the fundamental problem lies with the Chinese language teachers. We know that in the past, Chinese language teachers, when "explaining" a text, simply translated it, turning classical Chinese into modern Chinese, turning ancient grammar that students didn't understand into modern language, turning "Zi Yue" into "Confucius said." What else was there? Nothing else. Although occasionally there might be one or two vernacular Chinese articles in the textbook, how did our Chinese language teachers handle these materials? It was like this: "Vernacular Chinese, you can just read it yourselves; there's no need to explain it." This tone contained a kind of contempt and disdain, but the essence of the problem was that they themselves didn't quite understand the spirit and structure of vernacular Chinese. So, how could they explain it to others?!

    Now, we must not only oppose but also resolutely eliminate the conceited thinking of some educators. At the same time, we must also improve or eliminate certain stereotyped teaching methods. However, the fact is that some Chinese language teachers are still using their "traditional" teaching methods. No wonder students feel that Chinese is too shallow and there is too little classical Chinese. Secondary school Chinese language teachers must solve this problem, otherwise the educational role of this subject will be reduced or completely lost.

    Next, let's talk about the issue of lyrical prose.

    Here, lyrical prose doesn't simply refer to articles describing emotions, but includes all the poignant, humorous, witty, beautiful, and elegant descriptive writing; that is to say, all non-argumentative articles are lyrical prose. We know that secondary school students used to like articles such as "What I Know About Cambridge," "Letters to Young Readers," "Superman," and "Burial and Excavation." What exactly are these things? Why do they still like them? In a word, the petty-bourgeois intellectuals' sentimental, selfish, and superior thinking habits are at play. Today, every educator must recognize that the New Democratic education policy is to thoroughly eliminate self-pitying individualism, and revolutionary heroism and collectivism must be established. Therefore, we will never allow the erroneous theory of "lonely wisdom" to exist in our textbooks again. At the same time, we must use various methods to eliminate the general students' erroneous thinking.

    Conversely, let's look at whether the existing Chinese language textbooks have so-called lyrical prose? Yes, they do. Comrade Liao Chengzhi's "Sending From Afar" and Mr. Wu Han's "Mourning Father and Son Yi Duo" are both excellent examples of lyrical prose. As long as our Chinese language teachers can vividly narrate the spirit and deeds of General Ye Ting and Mr. Wen Yiduo's struggle for the democratic cause at that time, I believe that young and innocent secondary school students will be moved to tears! In this way, will they still be nostalgic for that "lonely wisdom"? Will they still covet that "person who wears night clothes, carries darts and a sword on his back, and comes and goes like the wind"? No, absolutely not. I believe that they will soon change, changing into the most advanced, smartest, and most promising young generation of the People's Republic of China.

    Turgenev said it well: "Virgin soil should not be plowed with a light, gliding wooden plow, but with a deep plow." I feel that our Chinese language teachers should remember this sentence, grasp their deep plow well, and cultivate diligently in the learning field of our young friends. Flowers will bloom soon.

  II. General Student Attitudes Towards the Chinese Language Subject

    Regarding this issue, the survey outline was formulated as follows:

    (1) How do you feel about Chinese language? ① Dislike, ② Indifferent, ③ Interested, ④ Especially fond of? What are the reasons: ① Useless, ② Easy to pass, ③ Free reading, ④ Chinese language teacher's inspiration, ⑤ Influenced by other factors?

    The statistics show that the most people are "interested," but the number of people who "dislike" and are "indifferent" combined is not much different from the number of people who are "interested." But the strangest thing is that these three types of people mostly produced almost completely opposite results due to the teacher's relationship. Therefore, we can easily deduce that the teacher's influence on students has a certain decisive significance. As for those who feel that Chinese is "useless," there are only a few.

    (2) Do you think the Chinese language teacher has solved for you: ① Reading methods, ② Writing skills, ③ Political understanding, ④ More organized thinking, ⑤ Solved no problems.

    What surprised us the most was that the cold statistics landed on question ⑤ the most. This tells us that the Chinese language teacher's teaching is almost a complete failure, and a terrible failure at that.

    The vast majority of students do not feel that Chinese is a "useless" thing. This means that they are all willing to learn Chinese. But why are there so many people who feel "dislike" and "indifference"? It turns out that after learning for so long, the Chinese language teacher has not solved any problems for them. In this way, how can they be interested? How can they not "dislike" it? We know that the courses in middle school are relatively complex, and general mathematics and other natural sciences all have extracurricular exercises. Therefore, rather than sitting dead in the Chinese language classroom listening to Chinese language teachers giving lessons that "do not solve any problems," it is better to rest your brain and prepare to do math problems. Rather than spending the whole day looking at homework left by teachers who can't solve any problems, it is better to do more homework that can increase knowledge. Then, who has lowered the proper status of the middle school Chinese language course? I think this is self-evident.

  III. Teaching Methods

    The traditional teaching method of our middle school Chinese language is to explain the text word by word and sentence by sentence. Under the influence of this teaching method, what students gain is only recognizing a few "rare words" and understanding a few more "ancient grammar" rules.

    Today, the teachers who teach Chinese must not only understand themselves, but also must make the students understand: the Chinese textbook is different from the "Thousand Character Classic," and it is not a garbage can of "strange nouns." As Fadeyev said: "These poems, together with other materials, will show how noble the faces of these warriors who are fighting for the future are... Life flourishes because of them; without them, the valley fields of life will decay." Yes, Chinese is so important. It is the seed of human wisdom. Without it, "the valley fields will decay." We must make students fundamentally value the Chinese language course, and then carefully sow this precious seed into the wisdom gardens of our most advanced, smartest, and most promising young generation.

    The survey form tells us that all Chinese language teachers who have achieved certain teaching results must include the following methods in their teaching methods: (1) Explaining the spirit and structure of the article; (2) Adding other materials to connect with reality. I think both of these methods are necessary, and it is precisely because of the above two methods that Soviet middle school literature classes have achieved amazing and huge results. We must learn from the Soviet Union, learn from them how to "correctly, understandably, and movingly bring the huge ideological treasures contained in our literature to the students and reveal them to them. Only then will literature have a huge positive impact on them" (Fadeyev's words).

    Of course, there are many methods of Chinese language teaching, and one cannot prescribe a set of rigid methods regardless of the specific objective situation. Only teaching methods that are connected with reality can arouse students' interest and achieve the above-mentioned goals.

    关于中等学校的国文教学
    刘国盈
    最近笔者因为工作上的关系，作了一次“关于中等学校国文教学”的调查，调查的结果虽然不大成功，但多多少少总是得到了一些材料。我想把它作为一个问题提出来，供给专家和教育工作者参考。
  一、教材问题
    据调查的结果，一般中学生对于现有的国文教材（新华书店出版，周静、王朴编），有如下的反映：“太浅”，“文言文太少”，“抒情文太少”，真的太浅吗？真的抒情文太少吗？我们作了一个研究。
    前两个意见，基本上是一个问题。那就是说，现有的国文教材不是太深或太浅的问题，而只是文言文和白话文所占的数量太多或太少的问题。是的，假如拿现在的国文课本和国民党时代的国文课本比较起来，文言文无疑地是减少了。我们姑且不谈文言文究竟有什么价值，然而，我们一定要问：为什么中学生对于文言文有这样大的兴趣呢？经验告诉了我们：除了极少数的学生外，绝大多数的中学生是不喜欢文言文的；而所以现在的中学生要求增多文言文，不是别的，基本的问题还在国文教师的身上。我们知道以前的国文教师，所谓讲书，只不过是翻译了一下罢了，把古文翻成了今文，把学生不懂的古语法翻成了现代的语言，把子曰翻成了孔夫子说，其它还有些什么呢？什么也没有。虽然偶尔在国文课本上也有一两篇白话文，可是，我们的国文教师们是怎样处理这些教材呢？是这样的：“白话文，你们看看算了，用不着讲。”这话的口气包含着一种轻蔑与不屑，但问题的本质是连他们自己也不太懂白话文的精神与结构，这样，怎样给别人讲呢？！
    现在，我们不但要反对而且要坚决消除一些教育工作者的清高思想，同时我们对于刻版式的某些教学方法，也要予以改善或革除。然而，事实的说明是有些国文教师还仍然在用他们“传统”的教学方法，这样无怪乎学生们感到国文太浅了，文言文太少了，对于这一问题，中学的国文教师们必须加以解决，否则这门学科的教育作用，将要降低或完全丧失。
    其次让我们谈谈抒情文的问题。
    所谓抒情文，在这里不单是指描写情愫的文章，而是所有的隽永、诙谐、幽默、优美、秀丽的描写文都包括在内，也就是说，凡不是论说的文章，都是抒情文。我们知道，中学生曾经是喜欢“我所知道的康桥”、“寄小读者”、“超人”、“埋存与发掘”等一类的文章。这些文章究竟是些什么东西？为什么还喜欢它？一句话，小资产阶级知识分子的温情、自私、优越感的思想习惯在作祟。今天，每一个教育工作者必须认识到：新民主主义的教育方针是要把顾影自怜的个人主义彻底肃清，革命的英雄主义与集体主义必须建立；因此我们决不许可再有“孤独的智慧”的错误理论存在于我们课本里，同时对一般学生的错误思想，我们也必须要用各种方法去消除它。
    反过来我们再来看看现有的国文教材是不是没有所谓抒情文呢？不，有。廖承志同志的“遥寄”、吴晗先生的“哭一多父子”都是很好的抒情文。我们的国文教师只要能够把叶挺将军和闻一多先生当时为民主事业奋斗的精神和事迹，很好的叙述一下，我相信年轻天真的中学生，一定会因感动而流出热泪的！这样，他们还会去留恋那“孤独的智慧”吗？！还会去贪图那“穿夜行衣服，带镖背剑，来去如飞的人”吗？！不，决不会，我相信他们很快的便会改变，改变为中华人民共和国的最先进、最聪明、最有为的青年一代。
    屠格涅夫的话说的很好：“处女土不应该用一架轻轻滑过的木犁，而是要用一架深入的犁来开垦的。”我感觉我们的国文教师们要切记这一句话，掌握好自己深入的犁，好好地在我们青年朋友的学习领域里去开垦，鲜花不久就会开放的。
  二、一般学生对国文学科的态度
    关于这个问题，调查大纲是这样拟定的：
    （一）你对国文感到：①讨厌，②不在乎，③还有兴趣，④特别爱好？是什么原因：①没有用处，②容易及格，③自由阅读，④国文教师的启发，⑤受了其它的影响？
    统计的结果，“还有兴趣”的人最多，可是“讨厌”和“不在乎”的人加起来，和“还有兴趣”的人相比，也就差不了几人了。但最奇怪的是这三种人，大多数都是因教师的关系而产生了近乎完全相反的结果。因此我们不难推知，教师对于学生的影响是有一定的决定意义的。至于感到国文“没有用处”的，只不过是几个人罢了。
    （二）你觉得国文教师给你解决了：①读书方法，②作文技巧，③政治认识，④思想更有条理，⑤什么问题也没有解决。
    使我们最惊奇的是无情的统计数字落在第⑤个小题上的最多。这告诉了我们：国文教师的教学几乎是完全失败了，而且是可怕的失败。
    绝大多数的学生，都没有感到“国文是没有用处”的东西，这就是说，他们都愿意学习国文，可是为什么感到“讨厌”和“不在乎”的人又是那么多？原来他们学来学去，国文教师也没有给他们解决问题；这样，他们怎么会有兴趣？怎么会不“讨厌”？我们知道中学里的课程比较起来很复杂，一般的数学和其它的自然科学又都有课外习题。因此，学生们与其是死坐在国文教室里听国文教师讲“不解决任何问题”的课，倒不如歇歇脑筋准备去作数学题更好些，与其是整天去看那些解决不了任何问题的先生留下来的作业，倒不如多作些还可以增进知识的功课更好些，那么，是谁贬低了中学国文课程的应有的地位？我想这是不言可喻的了。
  三、教学法
    我们中学国文的传统教授方法，是就课文逐字句的讲，而一般学生在此种教授方法的影响下，所收益的只不过是认识了几个“冷字”，多了解了几句“古文法”罢了。
    今天，我们教国文的教师们，不但自己要懂得而且一定要学生们也要懂得：国文课本不同于“千字课”，更不是“怪名词”的垃圾箱，正如法捷耶夫所说的：“这些诗同着其他的材料，会显出这些为将来而奋斗的战士的面貌是多么高贵，……人生由于有他们而开花，没有他们，人生的谷田会腐朽的。”是的，国文就是这么重要，它是人类智慧的种子，没有它“谷田会腐朽的”。我们必须让学生从基本上把国文课重视起来，然后细心地把这宝贵的种子，撒到我们最先进、最聪明、最有为的青年一代的智慧的田园里。
    调查表告诉了我们，凡是取得了一定的教学成绩的国文教师们，在他们的教授法里，一定包含着如下的方法：（一）讲文章的精神和结构；（二）增加了其它的材料连系实际。我想这两种方法都是必要的，而且正因为如上的两个方法，苏联中学的文学课，已经获得了惊人的巨大的成绩。我们要向苏联学习，学习他们把“包含在我们文学中的巨大的思想宝藏，一定要正确地、易懂地、动人地带到学生们的面前，启示给他们看。只有在那时候文学才会对他们起巨大的积极的影响”（法捷耶夫语）。
    当然，国文教学的方法很多，而且也不能不顾具体的客观情况，便规定了一套死方法。只有联系实际的教学法，才能引起学生们的兴趣，达到上述目的。
