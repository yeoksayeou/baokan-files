All-China Federation of Trade Unions Replies to Northeast Federation of Trade Unions
Regarding the Issue of "Visits and Inspections Affecting Production"

Northeast Federation of Trade Unions:

    We have received the work report from Comrade Zhou Shukang of the Shenyang Machine Factory, which was forwarded to us, dated October 28th. This report is well written. Please continue to send us similar reports in the future. The report mentions “requesting the higher authorities to find ways to minimize the burden on the three factories of repeatedly providing materials and constant visits, inspections, and requests for model workers to give reports.” This should indeed attract your attention, and similar situations have occurred in factories elsewhere. We offer the following suggestions for your reference when dealing with this issue:

    1.  All materials related to various aspects of the factory should be actively compiled separately by the Party, government, and trade union within the factory. At the same time, the factory's work situation and experiences should be reported regularly to the higher-level organizations. The Party, government, and trade union at the higher level should uniformly compile and print these materials and reports. In the future, if any party needs materials, they must go through you and not directly to the factory. If there is a special need, it must be with your introduction.

    2.  Visits and inspections cannot be completely refused, but they must be approved by a specific department. The factory should determine how to organize one day of visits per week, or the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions should organize those who want to visit at one time. The factory should designate specific staff members to be responsible for the reception work for visitors.

    3.  Model workers giving reports is necessary for exchanging production experiences and promoting the work of other factories. However, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions should take the initiative to do this in a unified and planned way, rather than being passive.

    With best regards,

    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　All-China Federation of Trade Unions
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　November 11th

    Appendix: Abstract of Zhou Shukang's report

    “...In October, there was the Shenyang Municipal Workers' Representative Conference, the People's Representative Conference, the Mid-Autumn Festival, and recently the Mechanical Bureau's Workers' Representative Conference, plus external visits, interviews, and condolences, going out to give reports and attend symposiums. Various systems of direct and indirect superiors ask for reports, statistics, materials, and exhibits. Everyone has great expectations for the three factories, and it seems difficult to refuse their enthusiasm, causing the factory director, deputy director, union chairman, planning section chief, technicians, model team leaders, and model personnel such as Zhao Guoyou, to be busy all day with dealing with people, entertaining, and writing materials, neglecting their own work. There are also internal meetings in the factory, preventing them from working well. For example, Zhao Guoyou worked the Saturday (22nd) night shift until 7 a.m., and was then pulled to the Women's Federation to give a report, and immediately afterwards was picked up by the Aviation School by car to give another report, leaving him exhausted, and this happens frequently. In this Mechanical Bureau's Workers' Representative Conference, the three factories sent thirty-six representatives, who are often key figures, organizers, and leaders in production, or skilled workers, greatly affecting production. ...I request the higher authorities to find ways to minimize the burden of repeatedly providing materials, and constant visits, inspections, and requests for model workers to give reports...”

### 全国总工会答东北总工会　关于“参观访问影响生产”问题

　　全国总工会答东北总工会
　　关于“参观访问影响生产”问题东北总工会：
    转来周叔康同志，十月二十八日在沈阳机器厂的工作报告收到。此报告写的尚好，以后请继续将这一类的报告寄给我们。报告中提到“请求上级设法尽量减少要三厂重复再三提供材料与不断参观、访问、请劳动模范作报告的负担”。确应引起你们的注意，其他各地工厂也曾有此情形。我们提供以下意见，供你们处理此问题时参考：
    一、工厂所有各种情况的材料，应由工厂中的党、政、工各方面，主动的分别整理出来。同时该工厂工作的情况与经验，应定期向上级组织作报告，由党、政、工上级组织，将这些材料与报告统一编印出来。以后任何方面要材料，均须通过你们，而不必直接到工厂去要。如有特殊必要，亦必须由你们介绍方可。
    二、参观、访问是不能完全拒绝的，必须经过一定部门批准，如何组织由工厂规定每星期一天参观日，或者由市总工会把要参观的人组织在一次去。厂内对于招待参观的工作，则应指定专门的职员负责。
    三、劳动模范出去作报告，对于交流生产经验，推动其他工厂的工作是必要的。但是也应该由市总工会统一有计划的、主动的去作，不要陷于被动就好了。
    此致敬礼

    附：周叔康报告摘要
    “……十月份沈阳市职工代表会、人民代表会、中秋节，最近又是机械局的职工代表会，加上外来参观、采访、慰劳、出去作报告、座谈会，各系统的间接及直接上级要报告、要统计、要材料、要展览品；大家对三厂都抱了很大希望而来，似乎盛情难却，弄得全厂中的厂长、副厂长、工会主任、计划科长、技术员、模范组长、模范人员如赵国有等，终天忙于应付、招待、写材料，放松业务，本厂内部还有会议，不得很好工作。如赵国有星期六（二十二）夜班，到天明七点才下工，就被拉到妇联去作报告，刚完又被航校汽车接去作报告，精力疲乏，且经常如此。这次机械局的职工代表会，三厂出席了三十六个代表，这些往往都是生产上的要角、组织者与领导者，或熟手，影响生产至巨。……请求上级设法尽量减少重复再三提供材料，与不断参观、访问、请劳动模范作报告的负担。……”
