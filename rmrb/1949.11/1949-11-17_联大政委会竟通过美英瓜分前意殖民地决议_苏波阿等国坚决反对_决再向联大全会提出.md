Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 16th: TASS, New York, 14th: The United Nations General Assembly Political Committee completed its review of the former Italian colonies issue on November 12th. The US-UK majority in the committee brazenly passed a resolution aimed at partitioning the former Italian colonies. The final discussion was on Argentina's proposal, which advocated transferring the interim administration of Somaliland to Italy, even before the signing of an agreement placing the region under Italian trusteeship. The Argentine representative, Arias, who advocated this proposal, claimed that the Argentine delegation had put forward this proposal after consultations with the British delegation, which had stated that the British government wished Somaliland to be placed under Italian administration as quickly as possible.

The Abyssinian representative pointed out that transferring the interim administration of Somaliland to Italy would only increase Abyssinia's anxiety about its national security. He said that Italy, as the trustee administrator of Somaliland, might refuse to accept the agreement on trusteeship in the future and might insist on clauses in the agreement that would be detrimental to the people of Somaliland.

The Soviet representative, Arutiunian, opposed Argentina's suggestion, pointing out that Argentina's amendment contradicted the Italian Peace Treaty, which stipulated that the existing administration should be retained until the fate of Libya, Eritrea, and Somaliland was finally decided. Representatives from the United States, Britain, France, and other countries supported Argentina's suggestion, insisting that the passage of this suggestion did not violate the Italian Peace Treaty. Several representatives from other delegations also doubted the legality of Argentina's amendment. In view of this fact, the Polish representative, Wibrowski, moved to submit Argentina's proposal to the Legal Committee of the General Assembly so that the committee could offer its views on the legality of this suggestion. However, this proposal was rejected by the Anglo-American majority on the committee.

After a lengthy discussion, the majority of the committee accepted the suggestion to transfer the interim administration of Somaliland to Italy before the trusteeship agreement was ratified.

The committee also decided that the United Nations Somaliland Advisory Council should begin to perform its functions at the same time as the interim administration of the region is transferred to Italy. At this point, the US-UK majority in the Political Committee passed all parts of the draft resolution on the former Italian colonies.

The Soviet representative, Arutiunian, stated after the vote that the Soviet delegation would not withdraw its draft resolution on the former Italian colonies but intended to submit this draft to the United Nations General Assembly for discussion. The Polish representative, Wibrowski, made the same statement regarding Poland's amendment to the resolution passed by the Political Committee by a majority.

Near the end of the meeting, the Abyssinian representative claimed that, according to a report in the Italian newspaper *Il Tempo*, an expeditionary force of 16,000 men was being trained in Italy to be sent to Somaliland. He also pointed out that on July 25th of this year, a demonstration was held in Rome in which demonstrators held up fascist slogans calling for the invasion of Abyssinia. The Italian representative, Tarchiani, tried his best to say that the news quoted by the Abyssinian representative was untrue. He said that this kind of news "is not worthy of attention" because "this news is quoted from fascist newspapers," and the Italian government has no responsibility for these newspapers.

The Soviet representative, Arutiunian, pointed out in response to this statement that the Italian representative had admitted that the news quoted by the Abyssinian representative was from a fascist newspaper. Therefore, the Italian representative admitted that fascist newspapers were indeed published in Italy. Tarchiani tried to escape this predicament, saying, "I said these newspapers are fascist newspapers. But I didn't say they were published in Italy. Perhaps these newspapers were published in Switzerland." But the Abyssinian representative immediately pointed out that the newspapers he mentioned were indeed published in Italy, not in any other country.

The Soviet representative, Arutiunian, requested that the committee include in the minutes of the meeting the fact that the Italian representative admitted that the facts cited by the Abyssinian representative came from a fascist newspaper. The Soviet representative declared that this further proved that fascist newspapers were being published in Italy.

In order to try to save face, the Italian representative tried to make more explanations and requested to speak again. The attendees paid close attention to the discussion that made the Italian representative embarrassed. Finally, in order to avoid the Italian representative's situation becoming even more dire, the US representative, Jessup, hurriedly moved to adjourn the meeting, thus rescuing the Italian representative.

　　联大政委会竟通过美英瓜分前意殖民地决议
    苏波阿等国坚决反对
  　决再向联大全会提出
    【新华社北京十六日电】塔斯社纽约十四日讯：联合国大会政治委员会已于十一月十二日完成审查前意大利殖民地问题。委员会中的美英多数已悍然通过旨在瓜分前意大利殖民地的决议案。最后讨论的是阿根廷的提案，该提案主张将索马利兰的临时行政甚至在签订将这一地区付与意大利托管的协定之前即移交意大利。主张这一议案的阿根廷代表亚斯声称：阿根廷代表团是在与英国代表团磋商后提出这一议案，英国代表团曾声言英国政府愿望索马利兰尽可能快地置于意大利管理之下。
    阿比西尼亚代表指出：将索马利兰临时行政移交意大利，只会增加阿比西尼亚对它的国家安全的焦虑。他说：受托管理索马利兰的意大利，在将来可能拒绝接受关于托管的协定，并可能坚持这一协定中会不利于索马利兰人民的条款。
    苏联代表亚鲁疆反对阿根廷的建议，指出阿根廷的修正案与对意和约相抵触，和约规定在利比亚、厄立特里亚和索马利兰的命运未最后决定前，保留现存的行政。美国、英国、法国和别的国家的代表支持阿根廷的建议，硬说通过这一建议并不违反对意和约。其他代表团的若干代表，也怀疑阿根廷修正案的合法性。波兰代表维布洛夫斯基鉴于这一事实，动议将阿根廷的议案提交大会的法律委员会，以便该委员会提出其对这一建议的合法性的看法。但这一提案竟遭委员会的英美多数所否决。
    经过长时间讨论后，委员会的多数接受了关于将索马利兰的临时行政在托管协定未被批准前移交给意大利的建议。
    委员会并决定联合国索马利兰咨询委员会应与将这一地区的临时行政移交给意大利的同时，开始履行其职能。至此，政治委员会美英多数即通过关于前意大利殖民地决议草案的各个部分。
    苏联代表亚鲁疆在表决以后发言称：苏联代表团并不撤回它对前意属殖民地的决议草案，而打算把这个草案提交联合国大会全会讨论。波兰代表维布洛夫斯基关于波兰对政委会以多数通过的决议案的修正案也作了同样的声明。
    会议将近结束时，阿比西尼亚代表声称：据意大利报纸邮报报道，有一支一万六千人的远征队正在意大利训练，将被派往索马利兰。他并指出，今年七月二十五日，罗马曾举行示威，示威者高举着号召侵略阿比西尼亚的法西斯口号。意大利代表塔奇阿尼竭力说阿比西尼亚代表所引的消息是不真实的。他说，这一类的消息“不值得注意”，因为“这些消息是从法西斯报纸上引用来的”，而意大利政府对这些报纸并没有责任。
    苏联代表亚鲁疆就这一声明指出：意大利代表已经承认阿比西尼亚代表所引的消息是来自法西斯报纸。因此，意大利代表就承认了在意大利的确有法西斯报纸出版。廷奇阿尼力图逃出这一窘境，他说：“我说这些报纸是法西斯报纸。但我没有说它们是在意大利出版的。也许，这些报纸是在瑞士出版的。”但是阿比西尼亚代表马上指出他所提到的报纸的确是在意大利出版的，并不是在任何其他国家。
    苏联代表亚鲁疆要求委员会把意大利代表承认阿比西尼亚代表所引证之事实是来自法西斯报纸一事列入会议纪录。苏代表宣称，这一点又证明了法西斯报纸正在意大利出版。
    为了要想挽回面子，意大利代表试图作更多的解释，再度要求发言。与会者密切注意使意大利代表狼狈不堪的讨论。最后，为了避免意大利代表的处境更加恶劣，美国代表耶塞普急急忙忙动议休会，这样解救了意大利代表。
