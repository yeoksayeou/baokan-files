Fujian's Water and Land Transportation Restored
Min-Gan and Min-Zhe Highways Open to Traffic

[Reported by This Newspaper] The Transportation Department and Navigation Bureau of the Fujian Provincial People's Government have vigorously restored and developed water and land transportation in the past two months, enabling all highways and waterways in the province that were destroyed by bandit troops to be quickly and fully restored.

Fujian has treacherous mountains and short rivers, making transportation extremely inconvenient. Within the province, land routes only include the main lines of Fu-Xia, Min-Gan, and Min-Zhe, connecting Fuzhou to Xiamen, Shangrao, Jiangshan, Lianjiang, and other places; waterways only include the Min River, which extends into the interior for more than 200 kilometers, connecting Fuzhou to Nanping, Jian'ou, and other places. After the liberation of Fuzhou, the Transportation Department devoted all its efforts to assist in the restoration of various transportation enterprises. The Minjiang Steamship Company quickly resumed operations on the first day after the liberation of Fuzhou, in response to the call for resumption of navigation by the Military Control Commission. The downstream and Pingshui steamship companies also resumed shipping one after another. Many ships that were hidden and in disrepair before liberation were towed out for repair, and the People's Government provided loans to support them. Within a month, the various steamship companies on the Min River repaired more than 100 steamships, putting them into the transportation of material exchange and supporting the front lines. Minjiang steamships, small motorboats, and sailboats are actively organizing new companies to open up航路航运. The Fujian Provincial Navigation Bureau was established at the beginning of this month and is gradually rectifying航路航运develop shipping. On the 8th of this month, it announced the Interim Measures for Navigation in the Lower Reaches of the Min River to ensure navigation safety. Regarding land transportation, after the Transportation Department of the Military Control Commission took over all public transportation institutions, it vigorously mobilized workers to carry out restoration work. The entire Fu (zhou) - Xia (men) road is open to traffic. The Minjiang, Min-Gan, and Min-Zhe highways have been repaired by the south-bound motor vehicle team and the staff of the northern Fujian Highway Administration while driving, and all bridges and culverts have been completely repaired. Now, the provinces of Fujian, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang are all open to traffic. The province has a total of more than 1,300 kilometers restored for passenger and freight transportation. Various vehicles from private and public automobile companies travel back and forth on the three major trunk lines of Fu-Xia, Min-Zhe, and Min-Gan. The rapid restoration of water and land transportation in Fujian has completed the great task of transporting a large army south to directly attack Xiamen and liberate the entire Fujian, and has ensured a steady supply of military supplies and food. Economically, it has played a huge role in exchanging urban and rural goods.

    福建水陆交通恢复
    闽赣闽浙公路畅通
    【本报讯】福建省人民政府交通处及航务局，两月来大力恢复开发水陆交通，使境内各被匪军破坏的公路与航路，迅速全部恢复。
    福建山岭险阻，河道短促，交通最不便利。全省境内，陆路只有福厦、闽赣、闽浙等干线，自福州通厦门、上饶、江山、连江等地；水道只有闽江可伸入内地二百余公里联系福州至南平、建瓯诸地。交通处于福州解放后即以全力协助恢复各交通企业。闽江轮船公司在福州解放后第一天，在军管会复航号召下，迅即恢复行驶。下游、平水两轮船公司亦相继恢复航运。许多在解放前隐藏失修之船只，都拖出修复，人民政府并贷款支助，一个月中闽江上各轮船公司修好轮船已有百余艘，投入物资交流及支前的运输。闽江轮船、小汽船、帆船已在纷纷组织新公司开辟航路。福建省航务局于本月初成立后，亦在逐步整顿航路发展航运，并于本月八日公布闽江下游航行暂行办法，保证航行安全。陆路交通方面军管会交通处接管全部公营交通机构后即大力发动工人进行恢复工作。福（州）厦（门）路全线通车。闽江、闽赣、闽浙公路经南下汽车团及闽北公路管理局职工的一面行驶一面抢修，全线桥梁涵洞已完全修复。现闽省与江西、浙江均已通车，全省共有一千三百余公里恢复客货运。民营公营汽车公司各种车辆源源来往于福厦、闽浙、闽赣三大干线。福建水陆交通的迅速恢复，完成了运输大军南进直捣厦门，解放全福建的伟大任务，并保证了军需粮草的源源供应。在经济上，对交流城乡物资等起了巨大的作用。
