    Malik emphasized: The adoption of the Soviet proposal to ban atomic weapons can ease the tense situation. This is an important step in consolidating peace and security and establishing mutual trust and international cooperation (especially cooperation among major powers). A positive resolution to the issue of banning atomic weapons will undoubtedly make it easier to resolve other post-war problems. Although four years have passed since the end of World War II, these post-war problems remain unresolved. Banning atomic weapons is of great significance for consolidating the United Nations. This can strengthen the spirit of mutual trust and cooperation within the UN organization and enhance the prestige and authority of the United Nations among the broadest masses of people around the world. This will inevitably make all future activities of the United Nations benefit all mankind.
    In concluding his speech, Malik put forward the following proposal:
    "First, the General Assembly is requested to note that, despite all the efforts made by the Soviet Union, none of the tasks assigned to the Atomic Energy Commission in the General Assembly resolutions of January 24, 1946, and December 14 of the same year have been resolved. The full responsibility for the failure to implement the aforementioned General Assembly resolutions lies entirely with the United States and British governments. They have systematically resisted in the Atomic Energy Commission the adoption of unanimously agreed decisions to ban atomic weapons and establish strict international control of atomic energy to prevent its use for military purposes. Second, the General Assembly, considering that the consultations among the permanent members of the Atomic Energy Commission as stipulated in the General Assembly resolution of November 4, 1948, have not been helpful in resolving the aforementioned tasks assigned to the Atomic Energy Commission; this is because, during the consultations in the Atomic Energy Commission, the representatives of the United States and Britain continued to support proposals that fundamentally run counter to the immediate ban on atomic weapons and the establishment of strict international control of atomic energy to prevent its use for military purposes. Third, the General Assembly directs the Atomic Energy Commission to resume its work in order to implement the General Assembly resolutions of January 24, 1946, and December 14 of the same year, and to immediately begin drafting a convention banning atomic weapons and a convention controlling atomic energy, and to sign and implement these two conventions simultaneously."

    通过禁止原子武器建议对巩固联合国有重要意义
    马立克强调指出：苏联所提禁止原子武器建议的通过，可以缓和紧张的局面，这是巩固和平与安全，建立互相信任和国际合作（首先是大国合作）的一个重要步骤。禁止原子武器问题的积极解决，无疑地将使解决其它战后问题更为容易。第二次世界大战结束虽然已经四年，这些战后问题却仍然没有解决。禁用原子武器对于巩固联合国有重要意义。这样可以加强联合国机构内互相信任和合作的精神，在全世界最广大的群众中提高联合国的威信和权威。这必然将使联合国今后的全部活动，造福于全人类。
    马立克在结束演说时提出下述提案：
    “第一，大会请大家注意，尽管苏联尽了它一切的努力，但是大会一九四六年一月二十四日和同年十二月十四日决议中交给原子能委员会的任务，却一项都没有解决。未能实现上述大会决议的全部责任，完全在于美国和英国政府。它们在原子能委员会中有系统地抵制通过禁用原子武器与建立严格的原子能国际管制，以防止用于军事目的的已经一致同意的决定。第二，大会考虑到大会一九四八年十一月四日决议所规定的原子能委员会各常任委员国间的协商，对解决交给原子能委员会的上述任务并未有何帮助；这是由于在原子能委员会在进行协商时，美国和英国代表继续支持实质上与立即禁用原子武器、建立严格的原子能国际管制、以防止用于军事目的背道而驰的建议所致。第三，大会命令原子能委员会恢复工作，以实现大会一九四六年一月二十四日与十二月十四日的决议，并立即开始拟订禁用原子武器的公约草案和管制原子能的公约草案，并同时签订与实施这两个公约。”
