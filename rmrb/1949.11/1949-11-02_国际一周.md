  　The Cry to Rescue American Communist Leaders Resounds Like Thunder Around the Globe

    The call to oppose the American fascist verdict and rescue the leaders of the American Communist Party has resounded around the globe like thunder. Within the United States, the movement to rescue the American Communist leaders has developed into a broad mass movement. Responsible personnel from many labor unions held an emergency meeting in New York and established a trade union committee to fight for the rescue of the American Communist leaders. Two hundred trade union leaders from the CIO and the AFL established the "Trade Union Committee for Political Freedom" in Chicago on October 23, deciding to carry out the struggle to restore the freedom of the American Communist leaders throughout the Midwest. On the 22nd, tens of thousands of people in the Black district of New York held an outdoor demonstration in torrential rain, demanding the immediate release of the American Communist leaders. Protest demonstrations and mass rallies against this fascist atrocity were also held in St. Louis and other cities. Many people's organizations, progressive artists, writers, educators, and other individuals have issued statements, declarations, and petitions, sending strong protests to the American reactionaries. Donations to support the persecuted American Communist leaders have been continuously sent to the American Communist Party headquarters from all over the country. In less than a week since the verdict was announced, donations received from outside New York State have exceeded $60,000.

    The savage persecution of the American Communist leaders has prompted solemn protests from all righteous people around the world. In Latin America, the Cuban capital, Havana, held a protest rally. The Argentine Communist Party telegraphed its active support for the American Communist leaders, and the Argentine League for the Defense of Human Rights announced that it would take strong action to rescue the American Communist leaders, denouncing the trial as "identical to the trials conducted by the Nazis." In Europe, the Communist Parties of France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Austria, and Sweden angrily protested this shameful "verdict" by American imperialism and expressed their solidarity and shared destiny with the American Communist leaders. Public opinion in the Soviet Union and Poland, people from all walks of life in Czechoslovakia, progressive student groups in Sweden, and former members of the International Brigade in France also rose up in protest, and a committee to protect the American Communist leaders has been formed in Paris to take practical action to rescue the American Communist leaders.

    Encouraged by the American reactionaries, the Greek fascist authorities also sentenced nine Greek patriots, including Talagani, to death on October 13 and carried out unbridled fascist terror, which has equally aroused the public indignation of the world's righteous people. Soviet delegation leader Vyshinsky issued a special statement at a meeting of the UN General Assembly's Political Committee on the 24th, strongly urging the General Assembly to save the innocent Greek patriots sentenced to death and to stop the barbaric atrocities of the Athens government. Vyshinsky's statement received a wide response from world public opinion, and even many other national representatives on the UN General Assembly's Political Committee could not deny the undeniable and powerful arguments in this statement. The sophistry of the American and British representatives and their Greek lackeys only made them fall into a contradictory and embarrassing situation. The executioner face of the American reactionaries was fully exposed here.

    Shameless Trials by American, Australian, and Greek Reactionaries Arouse Public Indignation Among the World's Righteous People

    The Chinese people are extremely concerned about the persecution by American reactionaries and their followers of Communists and all other fighters for peace, democracy, and human progress in various countries. Various Chinese people's organizations and democratic figures have issued statements and speeches, expressing support for the just struggles of the Communist Party of the United States and the American people, the Communist Party of Australia, and the Greek people. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a statement on the 30th, resolutely protesting the American reactionary government's sentencing of American Communist leaders Dennis and others to three to five years in prison, the Australian reactionary government's sentencing of Australian Communist Party General Secretary Sharkey to three years in prison, and the Athens reactionary government's sentencing of revolutionary leaders such as Talagani to death, and expressed its greater efforts to support the just struggles of the Communist Parties of the United States, Australia, and Greece for the interests of their own people and the interests of world peace. The statement of the Central Committee of the CPC pointed out that such reactionary trials by the American, Australian, and Greek reactionaries "do not indicate the strength of the reactionary forces in various countries, but rather their fear of their impending death."

    Establishment of Diplomatic Relations Between China and Germany Further Strengthens the Peace and Democracy Camp

    The relationship between the Chinese people and the people of the world is becoming increasingly close. On October 25, Minister Zhou of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a note to the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the German Democratic Republic, notifying that the People's Republic of China had decided to establish diplomatic relations with the German Democratic Republic and send diplomatic representatives. This wise decision of our Central People's Government will further unite the two great nations of China and Germany in the struggle for the cause of world peace and democracy, and further strengthen the democratic peace camp headed by the Soviet Union. Congratulations on the establishment of the People's Republic of China from this democratic peace camp continue to express the world people's concern for the great victory of our people. Soviet writers convened a conference in Moscow on October 20 to celebrate the new China. Czechoslovak President Gottwald received a Chinese youth delegation on October 25, praising the great international significance of the victory of the Chinese revolution and expressing his great excitement. Progressive people in Iran hailed the birth of the new China. Albanian Chairman of the Council of Ministers Hoxha, Greek Provisional Democratic Government Chairman Mitsos, the Central Committee of the Algerian Communist Party, World Federation of Trade Unions General Secretary Saillant, the Municipal Council of Saint-Denis in the Seine department of France, and others have all sent telegrams to Chairman Mao to congratulate him.

    The Movement to Defend World Peace and Democracy Achieves New Development in Britain and France

    As the unified leading body for defending world peace, the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress is taking steps to further develop the struggle to defend world peace. The Standing Committee held its second plenary session in Rome from October 28 to 30, summarizing the peace movements in various parts of the world since the World Peace Congress was held and deciding to launch new struggles. The Executive Bureau of the Standing Committee has passed a resolution exposing the two-faced attitude of the Yugoslav Peace Committee, which verbally supports peace but actually follows the Tito group, and refusing its participation in the Rome meeting. This is a major and necessary measure to make the peace camp more consolidated and pure. The movement to defend world peace and strive for people's democracy has seen new development in Britain and France. The first conference of the British Peace Congress, representing one million British people, was successfully held in London from October 22 to 23. The enthusiastic speeches of representatives from all sides at the meeting reflected the British people's determination to oppose new wars of aggression and their desire to establish friendly relations with the Soviet Union, China, and the people's democratic countries. The conference passed important resolutions on defending peace. The peace vote movement launched throughout France proves that the French people's willingness to fight for peace cannot be resisted by any evil forces. Despite the various repressive, obstructive, and destructive measures implemented by the French reactionary authorities, the vast majority of the French people still bravely participated in the vote. In the Seine province alone, more than one million people voted in favor of peace. At the same time, the French people are continuing to carry out a strong struggle to establish a democratic and unified government. This has caused the French government crisis to last for three weeks since the reactionary government of Queuille fell on October 5. Under the strong opposition of the French working people, the reactionaries Mock and Meyer, who were ordered to form a cabinet, have failed one after another. Now, the French ruling group has brought out Bidault, the leader of the Popular Republican Movement, to form a cabinet, but its foundation is equally built on sand.

    American Imperialism Makes New Arrangements for Foreign Aggression, Attempting to Salvage Its Bankrupt Conspiracy

    American imperialism is making new arrangements for foreign aggression, attempting to salvage its anti-revolutionary plan that has failed everywhere. The American reactionaries, whose secret service and sabotage activities in the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries suffered a serious blow due to the uncovering of the Rajk treason case in Hungary, are frantically holding a meeting of Western European envoys in Paris on October 20, and then holding a meeting of Eastern European envoys in London on October 24 and 25, to discuss new strategies for strengthening secret service activities against the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries of Eastern Europe, and attempting to use the Tito group as the center for carrying out conspiratorial sabotage activities. In the East, American imperialism continues to carry out its conspiracy plans against China and the Asian people at the same time. On the one hand, American reactionaries are stepping up their conspiracy to annex Taiwan Province, a territory of China. American aggressors Smith, Chennault, and others have recently flown to Taiwan one after another amidst the calls of American reactionary newspapers for "trusteeship of Taiwan." American imperialism is instigating its running dog Liao Wenyi to step up his calls for "Taiwan independence" and is encouraging its Philippine puppets to come forward to support the so-called "Taiwan independence movement." On the other hand, American imperialism is planning to replace Britain's position in India and use India as a major pillar for the United States to confront the rising national democratic movement in Asia. Indian Prime Minister Nehru, harboring the illusion of seeking huge "American aid" and "playing a leading role in Asia," flew to the United States on October 11 at the invitation of Truman. He has constantly held talks with his American masters, especially on the situation in Southeast Asia related to the great victory of the Chinese people. In public speeches, Nehru has expressed his willingness to be loyal to the United States, guaranteeing that he will "not and will not maintain neutrality" in international affairs.

　　国际一周
  　营救美共领袖的呼声　似巨雷一样震响全球
    反对美国法西斯判决和营救美共领袖的呼声，已似巨雷一样震响全球。在美国国内，营救美共领袖的运动，已发展成为广泛群众性的运动。许多工会的负责人员也在纽约举行非常会议，成立了为营救美共领袖而斗争的工会委员会。产联、劳联的工会领袖二百人，十月二十三日在芝加哥成立了“争取政治自由工会委员会”，决定在整个中西部地区进行为恢复美共领袖自由的斗争。二十二日，纽约黑人区有成千成万的人们，在倾盆大雨中举行户外示威运动，要求立即释放美共领袖。圣路易及其他若干城市也举行了反对这个法西斯暴行的抗议示威和群众大会。许多人民团体、进步的艺术家、作家、教育家以及其他人士，纷纷发表声明、宣言、请愿书，向美国反动当局发出了强烈的抗议。维护遭受迫害的美共领袖的捐款，从全国各地不断送至美共总部。自宣布判决以来还不到一周，从纽约州以外地区收到的捐款，即已超过六万美元。
    对美共领袖的野蛮迫害，全世界一切正义人类纷纷提出严正的抗议。在拉丁美洲，古巴京城哈瓦那举行了抗议集会。阿根廷共产党通电积极支持美共领袖、阿根廷维护人权同盟宣布采取有力行动营救美共领袖；并痛斥这一审判“与纳粹进行的审判如出一辙”。在欧洲，法国、荷兰、比利时、奥地利及瑞典等国共产党，愤怒地抗议美帝国主义这一可耻“判决”，并对美共领袖表示声援和休戚与共。苏、波等国舆论界、捷克各界、瑞典进步学生团体以及法国前国际纵队队员，亦奋起抗议，巴黎并已组成保护美共领袖委员会，采取实际行动营救美共领袖。
    在美国反动派鼓励下，希腊法西斯当局在十月十三日也判处希腊爱国者塔拉甘尼等九人死刑，并实行肆无忌惮的法西斯恐怖，这已同样激起了世界正义人民的公愤。苏联代表团团长维辛斯基二十四日在联大政治委员会会议上发表特别声明，力促联大拯救无辜被判死刑的希腊爱国者，制止雅典政府的野蛮暴行。维辛斯基的声明，受到了世界舆论的广泛的响应，甚至联大政治委员会的许多其他国家代表，也无法否认这一声明的无可争辩的有力论据。美英代表及其希腊走卒的狡赖，越是使他们自己陷于前后矛盾、狼狈不堪的境地。美国反动派的刽子手面目在这里原形毕露。
    美澳希反动派无耻审判　激起世界正义人民公愤
    中国人民对于美国反动派及其从仆们迫害各国共产党和其他一切为和平民主与人类进步而奋斗的战士，极为关切。我国各人民团体和民主人士纷纷发表声明和谈话，声援美国共产党和美国人民、澳大利亚共产党以及希腊人民的正义斗争。中国共产党中央委员会为此特于三十日发表声明，坚决抗议美国反动政府判处美共领袖但尼斯等三年至五年徒刑、澳大利亚反动政府判处澳共总书记夏基三年徒刑、雅典反动政府判处塔拉甘尼等革命领袖死刑，并表示更加努力支援美、澳、希三国共产党为本国人民利益和世界和平利益而进行的正义斗争。中共中央的声明指出，美、澳、希反动派这种反动审判，“不是表示各国反动势力的强大，而是表示了他们对于自己临近死亡的恐惧”。
    中德两国建立外交关系　更加加强和平民主阵营
    中国人民与世界人民的休戚相关的关系正日见密切。我外交部周部长于十月二十五日照会德意志民主共和国外交部长，通知中华人民共和国决定与德意志民主共和国建立外交关系，并派遣外交代表。我中央人民政府这一英明决定，将使中德两大民族在争取世界和平民主事业的斗争中进一步团结起来，更加加强以苏联为首的民主和平阵营。来自这个民主和平阵营的对中华人民共和国的成立的祝贺，继续表示世界人民对我国人民伟大胜利的关切。苏联作家于十月二十日在莫斯科召开了祝贺新中国大会。捷总统十月二十五日接见中国青年代表团，盛赞中国革命胜利的伟大国际意义，并表示极为兴奋。伊朗进步人民欢呼新中国的诞生，阿尔巴尼亚部长会议主席霍查，希腊临时民主政府主席米苏，阿尔及尔共产党中央委员会，世界工会联合会总书记赛扬，法国赛纳省圣但尼市政委员会等，均纷纷致电毛主席祝贺。
    保卫世界和平民主运动　在英法两国获得新发展
    作为保卫世界和平的统一领导机关世界拥护和平大会常设委员会，正采取步骤，进一步展开保卫世界和平的斗争。常委会已于十月二十八日至三十日在罗马召开第二届全体会议，总结自世界拥护和平大会召开以来世界各地的和平运动，并决定开展新的斗争。常委会执行局已通过决议，揭发南斯拉夫和平委员会口头拥护和平实际追随铁托集团的两面派态度，并拒绝其参加罗马会议。这是使和平阵营更加巩固和纯洁的重大而必要的措施。保卫世界和平与争取人民民主的运动，在英法两国有了新的发展。代表一百万英国人民的英国和平大会第一届大会，已于十月二十二日至二十三日在伦敦胜利举行。会上各方代表的热烈发言，体现了英国人民反对新侵略战争的决心，和要求与苏联、中国及人民民主国家建立友好关系的热望。大会通过了保卫和平的重要决议。在全法国展开的和平投票运动，证明法国人民为保卫和平而斗争的意愿，不是任何恶势力所能抗拒的。尽管法国反动当局实行了种种压迫、阻挠和破坏措施，但法国广大人民仍勇敢地参加投票，仅塞纳省一省，就有一百多万人投票拥护和平。同时，法国人民正在继续开展建立民主统一政府的坚强斗争。这使法国的政府危机自葛义反动政府于十月五日倒台后，持续三周之久。在法国劳动人民的强烈反对下，奉命组阁的反动派莫克和迈耶等人一个个地失败了，现在，法国统治集团又抬出人民共和党党魁皮杜尔出而组阁，但它的基础是同样建筑在沙堆上的。
    美帝作对外侵略新部署　妄图挽救已破产的阴谋
    美帝国主义正在作对外侵略的新部署，妄图挽救其到处失败的反革命计划。因匈牙利拉伊克叛国案的破获而使其在苏联和人民民主国家进行特务破坏活动蒙受严重打击的美国反动派，正慌张地于十月二十日在巴黎举行西欧使节会议后，又于十月二十四、二十五两日在伦敦举行东欧使节会议，商讨加强对苏联和东欧新民主各国特务活动的新策略，并图以铁托集团作为进行阴谋破坏活动的中心。在东方，美帝国主义同时继续进行反对中国及亚洲人民的阴谋计划。一方面，美国反动派正加紧实行其吞并中国领土台湾省的阴谋。美侵略分子史密斯、陈纳德等，最近在美国反动报纸高叫“托管台湾”声中相继飞到台湾活动，美帝国主义正策动其走狗廖文毅加紧叫喊“台湾独立”，并正怂恿其菲律宾傀儡出面支持所谓“台湾独立运动”。另一方面，美帝国主义正打算代替英国在印度的地位，利用印度作为美国对抗亚洲高涨中的民族民主运动的主要支柱。怀着求取巨额“美援”和“在亚洲起领导作用”幻想的印度总理尼赫鲁，应杜鲁门之邀于十月十一日飞抵美国后，曾不断与其美国主人会谈特别和中国人民伟大胜利有关的东南亚形势。尼赫鲁在公开演说中曾表明愿效忠美国，保证在国际事务中“不要也不致保持中立”。
