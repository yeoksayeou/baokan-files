　　Old Man Qiang Has a Group of Little Grandchildren

　　In November 1946, the Kuomintang bandit gang Hu Zongnan's troops prepared to attack Yan'an. The primary school of the First Nursery of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region moved to a mountain gully. The Young Pioneers often took the lead in conducting propaganda outside the school, helping the families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel to collect firewood, fetch water, and do other various tasks. Old Man Qiang, who was seventy-one years old and whose wife was sixty-nine years old, lived near the school. The old couple had only one son, an old Eighth Route Army soldier, who had been serving in the army for many years and had not returned. The village's preferential treatment cadre and the masses had always been very concerned about them, giving them gifts on holidays, bringing the two old people great comfort. But recently everyone was busy supporting the front lines, organizing militias, practicing grenade throwing, laying mines, etc., and did not have time to take care of them. Once, the preferential treatment cadre said to Old Man Qiang: "Uncle Qiang! We're busy these days and can't take care of you!" Old Man Qiang said with a lot of energy: "Don't worry! Just be busy with your work. I can take care of things at home myself!"
　　Despite what Old Man Qiang said, the corn on his three-plus mu of land was fully ripe and still standing in the field. The wind blew through the corn leaves with a rustling sound. Crows flew in flocks to peck at the corn.
　　Zhao Shengzhi and Xing Litong, the thirteen- or fourteen-year-old Young Pioneer leaders, were very worried when they learned about this! They discussed it with the other Young Pioneers and decided to harvest the corn for Old Man Qiang on Sunday. When the day came, the two of them went to see Old Man Qiang first to explain their intentions. But when Old Man Qiang heard that a group of children wanted to help him harvest the corn, he was a little worried, afraid that they would ruin his crops, so he hesitated and said: "Good children, don't trouble yourselves. I'll take care of it slowly myself." Zhao Shengzhi and Xing Litong saw what Old Man Qiang meant and said: "Grandpa, don't worry! We won't mess up your crops. We'll definitely harvest them well for you!"
　　Without waiting for Old Man Qiang to say more, they turned around and led the Young Pioneers to Old Man Qiang's cornfield. Old Man Qiang was still worried and followed them to the field.
　　As soon as the Young Pioneers arrived at the field, they got busy. Some were in charge of breaking off the corn cobs, and others were in charge of digging up the corn stalks. All that could be heard was "ka-ka-cha-cha," a continuous sound. Before long, the piles of corn cobs and the bundles of corn stalks were stacked up. Old Man Qiang watched from the field, truly delighted! His old, blurry eyes narrowed into slits, and he laughed heartily, saying repeatedly: "Good children, you are really capable! You are really capable! You are much stronger than Old Man Qiang!"
　　As Old Man Qiang spoke, he also began to break off the corn cobs. The Young Pioneers wanted him to rest, but he refused.
　　In less than half a day, the corn on more than three mu of land was completely harvested. In the afternoon, the Young Pioneers came again to help Old Man Qiang thresh the corn in the field. The field was very close to the school. Influenced by the Young Pioneers, many students also came to help with the threshing. Some used small knives to scrape, and others used sticks to knock. "Pi-li-pa-la," in less than half a day, a large pile of corn cobs was completely threshed. Then everyone, using baskets and hampers, sent the corn to Old Man Qiang's house and loaded it into his granary.
　　This made Old Man Qiang extremely happy! He smiled broadly, repeatedly stroking his yellowish-white long beard. His wife also came over, and the old couple praised and thanked the Young Pioneers repeatedly. The two Young Pioneer leaders walked up to them and said: "You two, don't be like that anymore! It's our duty to help you with some things. Your uncle is gloriously fighting the enemy bravely on the front lines! We are like your little grandchildren, and you are like our grandpa and grandma."
　　Hearing this, Old Man Qiang was even happier! He looked up and laughed heartily. After laughing, he stretched out both hands, grabbing the two Young Pioneer leaders tightly, and said very emotionally: "Good! Good! Good! You are all my little grandchildren, so you must listen to grandpa. Stand here and don't leave!" As he said this, he let go of their hands, took two steps, grabbed a few large handfuls of dried red dates from a jar next to the wall, wrapped them in his clothes, walked over, and said to the two Young Pioneer leaders: "This is a little something from grandpa and grandma. Everyone must have a taste!"

　　强老汉有了一群小孙孙
　　黑黎
    一九四六年十一月间，国民党匪帮胡宗南的军队准备进攻延安。陕甘宁边区第一保育院小学转移在山沟里。少先队员们经常带头到校外宣传，帮助烈属、军属拾柴、打水、做其他各种事情。学校附近的强老汉，七十一岁，他老婆六十九岁，老两口只有一个儿子，是个老八路，参军多年没回来。村里的优抗主任和群众，一向对他们都很关心，逢年过节，总要给他们送这送那，使他们两位老人家得到很大的安慰。可是这阵子大家都在忙着支援前线，组织民兵，演习摔手榴弹，埋地雷等等，一时也来不及照顾他们了。有一次，优抗主任对强老汉说：“老强叔！这阵子俺们忙，可有些顾不上照看你们了！”强老汉还满撑劲地说：“不怕！你们只管忙你们的，我家里的事，我会自己收拾的！”
    强老汉尽管这么说，可是他种了三亩多地的玉米，干透了还在地里长着。风吹着玉米的叶子，沙沙地响。老鸦一群一群飞来啄玉米吃。
    少先队长赵生枝和邢立统，这两个十三四岁的孩子，知道了这件事情，心里很着急！他们和少先队员们商量，决定在礼拜天去给强老汉收割玉米。到了这天，他们两个先去见强老汉说明意思。可是强老汉一听是群娃娃要帮他收割玉米，就有些不放心，害怕把他的庄稼糟蹋了，所以就支吾说：“好娃娃，不要麻烦你们了，我自己慢慢收拾吧。”赵生枝和邢立统看出强老汉的意思就说：“老人家，你放心吧！俺们不会把你的庄稼弄环的，一定好好给你收回来！”
    他们没等强老汉再多说，就回头领着少先队员们到强老汉的玉米地里去了。强老汉仍然不放心，也随后跟着他们走到地里。
    少先队员们一到地里就忙开了，有的专管撇玉米棒，有的专管刨玉米秆。只听喀喀喳喳，响成一片。不多一会儿，玉米棒放的一堆一堆的，玉米秆放的一捆一捆的。强老汉在地里看着，可真乐啦！一双老花眼睛，眯成了一条缝儿，哈哈的笑着，连声说：“好孩儿们，你们可真能行！你们可真能行！比我强老汉强的多！”
    强老汉说着，就也动手撇开玉米棒了。少先队员们，要他老人家歇着，他却不肯。
    不到半天光景，三亩多地的玉米，就完全收拾好了。下半天少先队员们又来帮助强老汉把玉米棒弄到场里打。这场子离学校很近，在少先队的影响下，许多同学也都来帮助打了，有的用小刀子刮，有的用棍子敲，劈里拍拉，又不到半天光景，一大堆玉米棒完全打干净了。接着大家就一簸箕一筐的，把玉米送到强老汉家，装在他的囤子里。
    这一下，强老汉高兴极了！笑嘻嘻的，连连摸着他那黄白色的长胡子。他老婆也走来，老两口儿，不住声的夸奖着感谢着少先队员们。两个少先队长走到他们跟前说：“你们两位老人家，再不要这样了！俺们帮你们做一点事是应该的。你们家的叔叔在前方英勇打敌人是光荣的！俺们就好比是你们的小孙孙，你们就好比是俺们的爷爷和奶奶。”
    这么一说，强老汉更乐啦！他仰起脸来，哈哈大笑起来。笑完了，伸出两手，一下紧紧抓住两个少先队长，很感动的说：“好！好！好！你们都是我的小孙孙，那可都得听爷爷的话，先站在这里不要走！”说到这里，他放开手，走了两步，在靠墙边的一个瓮里，抓了几大把干红枣子，用衣襟包着走过来，向两个少先队长说：“这是爷爷奶奶的一点心，每人都得尝一尝！”
