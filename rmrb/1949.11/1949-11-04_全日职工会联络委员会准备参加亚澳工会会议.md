　　Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo: The All-Japan Trade Union Liaison Committee submitted an application to MacArthur Headquarters on the 24th, requesting permission for a Japanese trade union delegation to accept the invitation of the World Federation of Trade Unions and travel to China to participate in the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference (previously incorrectly referred to as the Asian-Australian Trade Union Congress) to be held in Beijing in mid-November. The application, signed on behalf of four million Japanese workers, expressed dissatisfaction with MacArthur Headquarters' refusal this spring to allow a Japanese trade union delegation to attend the Second Congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions. The application pointed out that while MacArthur allowed representatives of reactionary Japanese trade unions to go to the United States to attend the CIO National Congress in November, it obstructed similar actions by the All-Japan Trade Union Liaison Committee. Therefore, the All-Japan Trade Union Liaison Committee announced that it had issued appeals to the United Nations, the Far Eastern Commission, the Allied Council for Japan, and trade unions of various countries, requesting them to take measures to ensure that its application be granted.

　　全日职工会联络委员会准备参加亚澳工会会议
    【本报讯】据新华社电讯：东京讯：全日职工会联络委员会于二十四日向麦克阿瑟总部提出申请书，要求准许日本职工代表团接受世界工联的邀请，前往中国，参加十一月中旬在北京举行的亚洲、澳洲工会会议（前误为亚澳职工代表会）。代表四百万日本工人签署的申请书，对麦克阿瑟总部今春拒绝准许日本职工代表团参加世界工联第二次代表大会，表示不满。申请书指出，麦克阿瑟一方面允许日本反动工会的代表赴美参加十一月举行的产联全国代表大会，另一方面却阻挠全日职工会联络委员会的类似行动。因此全日职工会联络委员会宣布，该会已向联合国、远东委员会、盟国对日委员会及各国工会发出呼吁，要求它们采取措施，使该会的申请获得准许。
