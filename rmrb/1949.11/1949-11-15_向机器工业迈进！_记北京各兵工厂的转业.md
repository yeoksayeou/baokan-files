    Moving Towards Machine Industry!
    A Record of the Transition of Beijing's Armaments Factories
    By Our Reporter Shang Kai
    In anticipation of the high tide of national economic construction, some scattered armaments industries in Beijing were merged in July this year to form the Beijing General Machine Factory and three branch factories, shifting from armaments production to peaceful construction production, and engaging in machine manufacturing. The situation and experiences of the Beijing Machine Factory over the past four months are introduced below for reference by other regions.
  Reforming the Organization Through Practice
    The Beijing armaments industries left over by the Kuomintang (nine institutes and twelve offices) were characterized by complex organizations, chaotic systems, and bureaucratic work styles, hindering the progress of production. After the establishment of the Beijing Machine Factory, it was decided to thoroughly reform this corrupt system on the existing foundation, through practical work, in a planned and step-by-step manner. The first step was to suspend the duties and salaries of special agents, bureaucrats, retired officers, and a few notorious key figures who held responsible positions in various institutes but were neither enterprise management personnel nor technical personnel, and to quickly identify the main responsible persons of each department as the backbone to support the work and reform the organization. Then, according to the needs of the work, a leading body of the general institute was established, technical and production management departments were added, unnecessary organizations were merged or abolished, and organizations that should have existed but did not were established; then, revisions and supplements were studied and modified from practice at any time. For example, the factory's former warehouse was only responsible for receiving, dispatching, and keeping materials, which was not suitable for the new production needs, so it was rebuilt as a material department, regularly responsible for planning, coordinating, and purchasing raw materials and equipment, establishing a budget and final accounts system, supplying production needs, and ensuring the completion of production tasks. In terms of personnel allocation, adjustments were also made from practice: initially, cadres were preliminarily understood, and job positions were preliminarily determined, and then, based on the strength of each person's work ability and expertise in the test of actual work, individual adjustments were made to enable cadres to play their roles. In order to be more practical, a democratic adjustment of organizations and personnel was implemented in late August. Over the past four months, the factory has continuously revised many shortcomings in the organization and system based on worker opinions, and established a relatively rational organizational structure, personnel allocation, and production management system.
  Starting Work While Repairing Machines and Factories
    Most of Beijing's armaments industries were scattered and dilapidated repair shops, lacking larger and complete mechanical equipment and spacious workshops. Especially after the rule of Kuomintang bureaucrats, factory buildings were collapsing and machines were incomplete. In order to ensure that the repair of machines and factories can meet the new production needs, the factory decided to carry out the repair work in the production process and gradually increase it on the basis of existing equipment. They divided all employees into three groups: repair, installation, and production, each with a dedicated person in charge of leadership, and proceeded separately. First, all the lathes were subjected to a major adjustment and modification according to the new work nature and production process, and some machines that had not been used for many years were rusted, oiled, and repaired. On the original basis, the general factory restored a 1,000-square-meter sand casting factory and six large workshops, and all branch factories also overhauled all machines. If any inappropriate places are found after the repair, they will be studied and corrected in production at any time to make them more reasonable and suitable for machine manufacturing. The factory is currently planning to establish machine cards, and conduct detailed assessments and registrations of the output, efficiency, parts, and lifespan of each machine, in order to accurately calculate productivity, implement accurate cost accounting, and lay the foundation for large-scale regular production and enterprise management.
  Undertaking External Work to Solve Financial Difficulties
    Machine manufacturing must have a sufficient supply of raw materials, which requires a large amount of funds for turnover; at present, when finances are relatively difficult and the national machine production plan has not yet been determined, it is obviously difficult to rely entirely on government support. Therefore, it is necessary to seek self-reliance methods, actively contact a batch of external work, increase capital income, to support the conversion. From the beginning, the Beijing Machine Factory took the initiative to undertake the manufacturing tasks of five coal loaders and 20,000 textile machine parts for Tianjin Zhongfang Company, 80,000 sets of magnetic bottle screws and 151 sets of water cranes for the Ministry of Railways. According to the statistics of three and a half months, in addition to the 300 million yuan allocated by the head office, the income from external orders also reached more than 300 million yuan, which not only enabled the raw materials to be fully supplied, but also enabled the wages of 1,400 employees to be paid in a timely manner, and at the same time supported the construction of the factory buildings and the repair of the machines.
    The following points should be paid attention to when accepting external orders during the conversion period: First, a full study and estimation should be made based on the factory's technical conditions, machine equipment, manufacturing capacity, and the source of raw materials, and then the contract should be signed, so as to avoid rework, waste, scrap, or delay, which will affect the credibility and the plan of the ordering department and the confidence of the factory's employees in the conversion. For example, before the factory was established, it first manufactured coal loaders for Tianjin Zhongfang Company. At that time, the calculation of labor, materials, and productivity was inaccurate, and the goods were blindly accepted. During the manufacturing process, it was reworked several times, which delayed for a month and caused a great loss. Second, do not want to manufacture large-scale complex machines at the beginning, but start from simple, fragmented, local, and rough, and gradually expand, improve technology and efficiency, and prepare for the manufacture of fine and complex machines. Third, we must proceed from the development of production and the improvement of technology, prevent profit-making viewpoints, and when signing contracts with foreign countries, we should establish credibility universally on the principle of being able to recover labor and material costs, management fees, and support production. And encourage employees to reduce costs and obtain profits from saving labor and materials, improving technology, and improving production efficiency. Fourth, we must lead the development of private machine industry. Because the original armaments production equipment is not completely suitable for today's machine manufacturing, for example, the lack of a large sand casting factory is a difficulty. If workers and equipment are blindly added due to the heavy task for a while, it will cause an imbalance of machine equipment and leave difficulties for future regular production. Therefore, after accepting orders, the Beijing Machine Factory handed over most of the sand casting projects and screw manufacturing to several private factories, on the condition that they were supplied with raw materials and given a certain profit. Over the past four months, there have been more than ten private iron factories and sand casting factories led by the factory.
  Learning New Technologies in Production Practice
    In the process of conversion of armaments industry, cultivating employees to learn new technologies and new businesses is an issue that cannot be ignored. The Beijing Machine Factory originally had more than 1,000 military workers. Except for a very small number of people who had worked in small iron factories and had simple machine manufacturing technology, most of them had not studied machine manufacturing. Therefore, technical difficulties were encountered in the conversion process. In response to these difficulties, the factory adopted the method of cultivating and improving on the basis of the existing technical level of the existing workers in the actual production work, and tried to find some technical workers familiar with machine manufacturing as the backbone, leading all workers to learn a certain technology in a certain production process. Workers, technicians, etc. who learn the same technology can study together. For example, in the sand casting process, at first, it was necessary to use firewood to bake the sand box dry. It took two days to cast a set of water cranes, which was wasteful, inefficient, and costly. After the sand casting workers held a forum and repeatedly studied, they changed to using wet molds for sand casting, saving a large amount of firewood, and the iron melting technology was greatly improved. It only took one day to make a set of water cranes. At the same time, other technicians have also improved their work efficiency by constantly researching and improving the use of tools and various actions. Therefore, the erroneous saying that "gun-making workers cannot make machines" has been basically overcome. Recently, the factory has also established a workers' night school, calling on workers to learn culture, learn theoretical knowledge, learn technology, and improve in a step-by-step and planned manner.
  Adjust Wages in a Timely Manner with the Development of Production
    In the past, the wages of the factory workers were determined according to the technology regulations of armaments production. For example, in the period of making guns and repairing machines, there were few sand casting projects, and the wages of sand casting workers were lower than those of other workers; after the conversion, sand casting became the main part of the machine production process, so the previous wage standards were no longer suitable for the new situation. The general factory and the branch factories had made preliminary adjustments once before and after the conversion.
    After a period of new work, the different technical levels and different working abilities of the workers gradually exposed. Some have high skills but low wages, and some have low skills but high wages. This unreasonable phenomenon began to affect production morale. Therefore, the factory conducted a second adjustment of wages in a democratic manner according to the new situation. After the second adjustment, it was recently found that there is still an uneven phenomenon of labor and leisure under the same salary, and it is urgent to implement a method of quantitative production and extra reward according to the principle of "more work, more pay" to adapt to the new production situation.
  Several Issues That Still Need Attention in the Future
    The conversion task of the Beijing Machine Factory has now been basically completed, creating development conditions for future regular production. However, there are still some weaknesses. First, the cooperation between the Party, government, and labor union is not enough, and the power of all parties has not been organized scientifically into the production process in a more specific, systematic, and planned manner. Second, although a relatively rational organizational structure and management system have been established, some places are still not proficient and thorough enough in the implementation, for example, some numbers are not accurate enough, and sometimes the procedures are not strict enough. In terms of management, the accounting system has not been established completely and accurately, and there are still some waste phenomena in some places. Third, in the process of conversion, everyone's technology and business have made a lot of progress, but they have not been fully proficient. These all require the factory to continue to work hard in the future to improve.

    向机器工业迈进！
    记北京各兵工厂的转业
    本报记者  商恺
    迎接全国经济建设的高潮，北京市一些零散的兵工业于今年七月间分别合并，组成北京机器总厂和三个分厂，转兵工生产为和平建设生产，进行机器制造。兹将四个月来北京机器厂的情形与经验介绍于后，供各地参考。
  从实践中改革机构
    国民党所遗留的北京兵工业（九所十二处）中，机构庞杂，制度紊乱，作风官僚化，障碍着生产的进行。北京机器厂成立后，即确定在现有基础上，从实际工作中，有计划有步骤的彻底改革这腐朽的一套。首先是将把持着各所负责地位而既非企业管理人员又非技术人员之特务、官僚、退伍军官、少数恶迹昭著的首要分子停职停薪，迅速确定各部门的主要负责人，作为支持工作与改革机构的骨干。接着即根据工作需要，建立了总所领导机构，增设了技术部门与生产管理部门，并将不必要的机构合并或撤消，该有而没有的机构予以建立；然后再从实践中随时研究修改和补充。例如该厂从前的仓库，只单纯负责收发保管，不适合新的生产需要，遂改建器材料，经常负责计划统筹采购原料器材，建立预算决算制度，供应生产需要，保证生产任务的完成。在人员的配备上，也是从实践中进行调整：先初步了解干部，将工作职位初步确定，然后从实际工作的考验中，根据各人工作能力的强弱及特长，再进行个别的调整，使干部都能发挥作用。为了更切合实际，八月下旬又实行民主调整机构与人事。四个月来，该厂不断地根据工人意见，修正了机构及制度中的许多缺点，建立起一套比较合理的组织机构，人事配备和生产管理制度。
  一面开工，一面整修机器与厂房
    北京的兵工业，大部都是一些零散破烂的修械所，缺乏较大的完整的机械设备，和宽敞的工作房。尤其经过国民党官僚统治之后，更是厂房坍塌，机器残缺。该厂为了使机器和厂房的整修能切合新的生产需要，决定将整修工作放到生产过程中去进行，并在现有设备的基础上，实行逐步增设。他们将全体员工分为修理、按装、生产三大组，各有专人负责领导，分头进行。首先根据新的工作性质和生产过程将所有的车床进行了一次大的调整和改装，将一些长年不用的机器，进行擦锈擦油修配机件，总厂在原有的基础上，恢复了一座一千平方米的翻砂厂，六个大的工作间，各分厂也都检修了全部机器。整修后发现有不合适的地方，随时在生产中研究纠正，使之更加合理，适宜于机器制造。该厂目前正在计划建立机器卡片，将每部机器的出品、效率、配件、寿命等进行详细的考核、登记，以便精确的计算生产力，实行精确的成本核算，为大规模的正规生产和企业化经营打下基础。
  承揽外活，解决资金困难
    机器制造，必须有充足的原料供应，因此也就需要大批的资金以供周转；在目前财政比较困难与整个国家的机器生产计划方针尚未确定，不能实行国家定货的时期，如果完全依靠政府支持，显然是有困难的。因此必须寻求自力更生的办法，主动接洽一批外活，增加资金收入，来支持转业的进行。北京机器厂一开始，便主动承揽了天津中纺公司五台架煤机、两万件纺织机零件、八万套磁瓶螺丝和铁道部的一百五十一套水鹤的制造任务。根据三个半月的统计，除总公司拨给款三亿元外，外面定货收入亦达三亿元之多，不但使原料得到了充分的供应，而且一千四百员工的工资也得以及时支付，同时支持了厂房的修建和机器的修配。
    在转业期间接受外部定货，应注意以下几点：第一、要根据本厂技术条件，机器设备，制造能力，原料材料之来源进行充分研究估计，再签订合同，以免反工（重做）浪费报废或延期，影响信用和订货部门的计划及本厂职工转业之信心。例如最初该厂尚未建立便先给天津中纺公司制造架煤机，当时对用工用料和生产力计算不确，盲目受货，在制造过程中几度反工，以致延误一月之久，亏本很大。第二、不要一开始就想制造大批的大型的复杂机器，要根据实际需要，从简单的零碎的局部的粗糙的做起，逐渐扩展，提高技术和效率，为制造精细复杂的机器做好准备。第三、要从发展生产、提高技术出发，防止营利观点，对外签订合同时，以能收回工料费、管理费，支持生产为原则，普遍建立信用。而鼓励员工从省工省料、改进技术、提高生产效率中来降低成本，获取利润。第四、要带领私营机器业向前发展。因为原来的兵工生产设备，不完全适合于今日的机器制造，例如缺乏大的翻砂厂，便是一个困难，如因一时任务重大而盲目增添工人，增添设备，即会造成机器设备的不平衡，给以后的正规生产遗留下困难。因此北京机器厂在接受定货之后，曾将大部分翻砂工程和螺丝制造交由几个私营工厂去做，条件是供给他们以原料，并给以一定利润。四个月来，经该厂带领起来的私营铁工厂与翻砂厂已有十余个。
  在生产实践中学习新技术
    兵工转业过程中，培养职工学习新的技术新的业务，是一个不可忽视的问题。北京机器厂原共有一千余军工工人，除极少部分的人曾在小型铁工厂做过工，具有简单的机器制造技术外，一般都没有学习过机器制造。因此在转业过程中遇到了技术困难。针对这些困难，该厂采取的办法是在现有工人的现有技术水平上，在实际生产工作中进行培养与提高，并尽可能找到一些熟悉机器制造的技术工人，做为骨干，带领全体工人，分别学习某生产过程中某一技术。学习同一技术的工人技师等可在一块研究。比如在翻砂过程中，起初必须用木柴火烤干砂箱，铸一套水鹤就得两天，浪费大，效率低，成本高。经翻砂工人召开座谈会反复研究后，改用湿模子翻砂，节省了大批木柴，熔铁技术也大为提高，做一套水鹤只需要一天了。与此同时，其他技工在使用工具及各种动作上，由于不断的研究改进，工作效率也都有提高。因此基本克服了“造枪工人不能造机器”的错误说法。最近该厂更建立了工人夜校，号召工人学文化，学理论知识，学技术，进行有步骤有计划的提高。
  随着生产的发展，及时调整工资
    该厂工人的工资，过去是根据兵工生产的技术规定的。例如在造枪和修械时期，翻砂工程很少，翻砂工人的工资也就比其他工人低；转业后，翻砂成了机器生产过程中的主要部分，因此以前的工资标准，已不适合于新的情况。总厂和分厂在转业前后，都曾初步调整过一次。
    经过一段新的工作后，工人之间不同的技术水平，不同的工作能力，逐渐暴露。有的技术高而工资低，有的技术低而工资高，这种不合理的现象，开始影响生产情绪。因此该厂根据新的情况，采用民主方式进行了第二次调整工资。第二次调整后，近又发现在同一工资下，仍有劳逸不均的现象，急须根据“多劳多酬”的原则，实行一种定量生产，超额奖励的办法，以适应新的生产情况。
  今后尚须注意的几个问题
    北京机器厂的转业任务，现已基本完成，为将来进行正规化生产创造了发展条件。但也还有一些弱点存在着。第一，党政工的配合还不很够，未能更具体、更系统、更有计划地将各方面的力量科学地组织到生产过程中去。第二，虽然建立了比较合理的组织机构和管理制度，但仍有一些地方执行得不够熟练和彻底，例如有些数目字还不够精确，有时手续上还不够严格等。在管理上，核算制度还没有完整的精确的建立，有些地方还有浪费现象。第三，在转业过程中，大家的技术与业务都获得不少进步，但并未完全熟练。这些都需要该厂今后继续努力，以求改进。
