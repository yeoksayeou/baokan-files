As is well known, this year the "Banner" magazine published a Russian translation of Ding Ling's novel "The Sun Shines Over the Sanggan River." Not long ago, this novel was also published as a separate book, and it has been widely welcomed by Soviet readers. Literary critics have unanimously praised Ding Ling's genius and skill in depicting how millions of Chinese working people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party headed by Mao Zedong, have awakened and are fighting for a new life.

The writers Kozhevnikov, Polevoi, Pavlenko, and several readers, in their speeches at the meeting, all pointed out that "The Sun Shines Over the Sanggan River" is one of the best works of democratic literature recently published. This realistic and inspiring novel has high artistic value.

In her reply, Ding Ling expressed her sincere gratitude to the representatives of the Soviet literary world for their warm, comradely reception and for the great interest her novel had aroused in the Soviet Union. She said that she is currently writing a new novel also about the Chinese countryside, in which she will depict the enormous changes that have already taken place in the lives of farmers in the People's Republic of China. Ding Ling also said that this is her second visit to the Soviet Union, and after returning home she very much wants to write a book describing the lives of the people of this great Soviet country.

　　莫斯科作家招待丁玲
  　座谈“太阳照在桑乾河上”
    【新华社北京十八日电】塔斯社莫斯科十七日讯：在文学杂志“旗”的编辑部里，莫斯科作家和“旗”的读者招待了现正访问莫斯科的新中国著名女作家丁玲。
    如所周知，今年“旗”杂志刊登了丁玲的小说“太阳照在桑乾河上”的俄文翻译。不久以前，这本小说又出了单行本，在苏联读者中广受欢迎。文学批评家一致称誉丁玲天才而技巧地描写出中国数以百万计的劳动人民，怎样在以毛泽东为首的中国共产党领导之下觉醒过来，为新生活而斗争。
    作家科热夫尼科夫，波列伏伊，巴夫连科和若干读者，在会上发言时都指出：“太阳照在桑乾河上”是最近刊行的民主文学著作中最优秀的作品之一。这本真实而富感召力的小说有很高的艺术价值。
    在答辞中，丁玲为给予她的热烈的、同志般的款待，以及为她的小说在苏联所引起的浓厚兴趣，向苏联文学界代表们热诚致谢。她说：她正在创作一本也是关于中国农村的新小说，她将在这小说中描绘中华人民共和国农民生活上所已发生的巨大变化。丁玲又说：这是我第二次来苏联，回国后我非常想写一本书，描述这个伟大的苏维埃国度的人民生活。
