　　Joy and Love
    ——Letters from Commanders and Fighters from All Over Congratulating the Birth of New China
    During the meeting of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and after the establishment of the Central People's Government, countless congratulatory letters flew like snowflakes from commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army all over the country. These letters were filled with the joy of all the commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army for the birth of New China, their loyalty and love for the Central People's Government, and their warm love and support for the great people's leader, Chairman Mao. The commanders and fighters unanimously expressed in their letters that they would resolutely defend the fruitful result of this great unity and great victory of the people—the People's Motherland, and resolutely expressed that they would unite with all progressive and democratic forces in the world to oppose the imperialists' new war conspiracies and defend lasting world peace. Many congratulatory letters and good news reports were written on red paper. Some were jointly signed by the entire regiment, battalion, or company of commanders and fighters, many were written by squads, and many were written by soldiers individually.
    The entire squad of the Second Platoon of the Sixth Company of the 608th Regiment of the 203rd Division, who participated in the grand review on October 1st for the founding of the People's Republic of China and the Central People's Government, said in a congratulatory letter to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu: "The People's Republic of China has been founded, and we are all very happy, with indescribable joy in our hearts. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, we have fought hard for more than twenty years, won a great victory, and established our own people's motherland. How worthy of celebration! For many years, the Chinese people have suffered from the bullying of imperialism and the exploitation of bureaucratic capitalists and landlords. There was no place to redress grievances and no place to complain of suffering, all because the state power was in the hands of the reactionaries. Now that our People's Government has been established, the people themselves control the power, and they will no longer be bullied and oppressed by these three major enemies." The soldiers of the Fourth Platoon of the Sixth Company of the 608th Regiment said in their congratulatory letter: "We must work hard in this grand military training, study hard, overcome guerrilla habits, establish a regularized national defense army, obey the command and leadership of the Central People's Government, and resolutely carry the revolution through to the end."
    The entire body of commanders and fighters of an artillery regiment of the Third Field Army said in a congratulatory letter to all representatives of the People's Political Consultative Conference: "We clearly know that the reason why the Chinese people defeated the reactionaries is due to the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the heroic and selfless fighting of the People's Liberation Army, and the united struggle of all democratic parties, democratic figures, and the broad masses of the people. From now on, we pledge to resolutely struggle for the thorough realization of all resolutions of the People's Political Consultative Conference under the leadership of the Central People's Government." The entire squad of the Seventh Squad of the Second Platoon of the Fourth Company of an artillery regiment of the Third Field Army guarding Nanjing said in a congratulatory letter to the Central People's Government: "The Kuomintang bandit gang is dying, but with the help of American imperialism, it is constantly and frantically bombing the liberated areas and instigating bandits and secret agents in an attempt to disrupt the revolutionary order in the liberated areas. We must smash their conspiracies and consolidate the people's victory." The soldiers of the Fifth Squad of the Second Platoon of the unit pledged to heighten their vigilance in guard work, eliminate bandits and special agents, and build a new Nanjing. The entire squad of the Eighth Squad of the Third Platoon pledged in their congratulatory letter to complete the current grand military training and regularization tasks, and to train themselves into steel-like national defense army soldiers. Ni Yuechu, a soldier of the First Squad of the First Platoon of the Third Company who revolted and raised righteousness in Jurong, condemned the Kuomintang bandit gang for grabbing soldiers and forced labor in a congratulatory letter, and expressed his gratitude for the opportunity to join the army and seek revenge given by the People's Liberation Army.
    The soldiers of the Guard Regiment of the Fourth Field Army Headquarters expressed their gratitude to the People's Political Consultative Conference for its condolences to all commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army in a congratulatory letter to the representatives of the People's Political Consultative Conference, and expressed that they would repay the warm condolences of the People's Political Consultative Conference with hard work in study and active strengthening of guard work. Gao He, a soldier of the Eighth Company of the Third Battalion of the Guard Regiment, said in a letter to all representatives of the People's Political Consultative Conference: "Thank you for representing the people of the whole country in caring for us like a loving mother cares for her son. We soldiers have the confidence to defend our new country and not allow any imperialist to invade an inch of land." The soldiers of the Third Squad of the First Platoon of the Machine Gun Company of the Third Battalion of the Guard Regiment said even more vigilantly in their congratulatory letter: "Now the Kuomintang bandit gang still has some remaining strength, we cannot underestimate the enemy, and we cannot relax our vigilance and combat effectiveness. We must work hard to overcome all difficulties, completely eliminate the remaining Kuomintang bandit troops, and carry the revolution through to the end."

　　喜悦与热爱
    ——各地指战员函贺新中国诞生
    在中国人民政治协商议会开会期间和中央人民政府成立之后，从全国各地雪片似地飞来了无数封人民解放军指挥员、战斗员们的祝贺信件。在这些贺信里，洋溢着全体人民解放军指战员们对于新中国诞生的喜悦，对于中央人民政府的忠诚和热爱，对伟大人民领袖毛主席的热烈爱戴和拥护。指战员们在信里一致地表示要坚决保卫这个人民大团结大胜利的丰硕果实——人民祖国，并坚决地表示要和世界上所有进步民主力量联合在一起，反对帝国主义者的新战争阴谋，保卫世界的持久和平。贺信和喜报很多都是用红纸写的，有的是整团、整营、整连的全体指战员们共同签署的，有很多是以班为单位写的，也有不少是战士们自己单独写的。
    参加了十月一日中华人民共和国暨中央人民政府成立典礼大检阅的二○三师六○八团六连二班全体战士在写给毛主席和朱总司令的贺信中说：“中华人民共和国成立了，我们都非常高兴，心中有说不出的快乐。我们在毛主席、朱总司令的领导下苦战了二十多年，获得了伟大的胜利，建立了自己的人民祖国，是多么值得庆贺呀！中国人民好多年来受尽了帝国主义的欺负，受尽官僚资本家和地主的剥削，有冤无处伸，有苦无处诉，都只是因为国家政权操在反动派手里。现在咱们人民政府成立了，人民自己掌握政权了，再也不会受这三大敌人的欺负和压迫了。”六○八团六连四班的战士则在贺信中说：“我们一定要在这次大练兵中，努力学习，克服游击习气，建立正规化的国防军，服从中央人民政府的指挥和领导，坚决将革命进行到底。”
    第三野战军某部炮兵团全体指战员在给人民政协全体代表的贺信中说：“我们清楚地知道中国人民之所以打败了反动派，这都是由于中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导，人民解放军的英勇善战和不惜牺牲以及各民主党派、民主人士团结广大人民一致奋斗的结果。今后我们誓在中央人民政府领导下为人民政协一切决议彻底实现而坚决奋斗。”警卫南京的第三野战军某部炮兵团四连二排七班全体指战员在致中央人民政府的贺信中说：“国民党匪帮已奄奄一息了，但它还在美帝国主义的帮助下不断地疯狂轰炸解放区，策动土匪特务，企图破坏解放区的革命秩序，我们一定要粉碎它们的阴谋，巩固人民的胜利。”该部二排五班战士保证在警卫工作中提高警惕，肃清匪特、建设新南京。三排八班全体战士在贺信中保证完成目前大练兵、正规化任务，并把自己锻炼成钢铁一样的国防军战士。一个在句容反正举义的三连一排一班战士倪月初在贺信中控诉了国民党匪帮抓丁拉夫罪行，并对解放军予以入伍和报仇的机会表示万分的感激。
    第四野战军司令部警卫团的战士们在给人民政协代表的贺信中对人民政协致人民解放军全体指挥员、战斗员的慰问表示感谢，并表示将以努力学习、积极加强警卫工作来答谢人民政协热忱的慰问。警卫团三营八连战士高和在致人民政协全体代表的信中说：“感谢你们代表全国人民象慈母爱护儿子一样地慰问我们。我们军人有信心保卫我们新的国家，不让任何帝国主义者侵略一寸土地。”警卫团三营机炮连一排三班战士们更在贺信中警惕地说：“现在国民党匪帮还剩下一些残余力量，我们不能轻敌，更不能放松警惕性和战斗力，要努力克服一切困难，彻底消灭残余国民党匪军，将革命进行到底。”
