　　IV. Capturing the Yaobu Great Iron Bridge
    After marching continuously for a day and two nights, the troops arrived at Hetou Market, 25 miles north of Yingde, at 1:00 PM on the 9th. We heard from the guerrilla comrades that there was a regiment of bandit troops between Yingde Station and the Yaobu Great Iron Bridge, who had fled from Qujiang; there was also an empty train parked at the station, attempting to withdraw to the south bank of the Bei River when they could no longer "hold" the station, and blow up the largest iron bridge in the southern section of the Yuehan Railway – the Yaobu Market Great Iron Bridge – to resist our army with its defenses.
    Upon hearing this news, the troops were immediately energized: "We've been walking day and night just to settle accounts with them. It's not easy to come across such an opportunity." Our commanders and fighters, afraid that the enemy would run away, advanced without stopping. The regimental command post was set up on Banshu Slope, not far from Yingde Station, and combat deployments were quickly completed. This was a very wise battle plan: using powerful troops to outflank the enemy from the left and right wings, and then using heavy firepower to pressure them frontally along the railway, taking advantage of the bandit troops' unpreparedness to annihilate them on the north bank of the Bei River, in order to seize the Great Iron Bridge.
    At 4:40 PM, just as our "91" type infantry artillery was being moved to the front, fighting had already begun at Yingde Station. The heroes of our division's reconnaissance team unexpectedly descended on their "camp" and fought a joyful battle. The Ninth Company, known for its ability to overcome fortifications, rushed forward. "Follow me!" Second Platoon Leader, Communist Party member Li Haofeng, led the assault team to rush onto the bridge and was wounded by bullets fired from the enemy's bridgehead fort. First Platoon Leader Wang Changshui immediately caught up, taking the lead in capturing the northern bridgehead fort. Unfortunately, a bullet passed through his abdomen, and our outstanding vanguard member of the proletariat heroically sacrificed himself! First Platoon Deputy Zheng Tianfu immediately took over, "Charge!", and our heroes swept across the bridge like a whirlwind. The Chiang bandit troops on the other side of the bridge thought it was their own people retreating and even asked, "Who? Who?" First Platoon Deputy Zheng Tianfu and combat hero Deng Xincheng swept the area with a submachine gun, scattering the enemy in terror. The wire connected to two hundred pounds of yellow explosives at the center of the bridge was still lying there intact. First Platoon Deputy and medic Li Wensheng quickly cut it from both ends.
　　V. Local Guide Wu Yayin
    During the capture of the 260-meter-long Yaobu Great Iron Bridge, a robust peasant dressed in black clothes ran forward in our ranks. When the battle ended, he captured two bandit soldiers and seized three rifles and a machine gun. His name was Wu Yayin, and he was from Caizhou Village in Zai'e Township, Yingde County, more than ten miles from here. Two days ago, his family's belongings were looted by bandit troops, his wife was dragged away to be a "porter," and he was forced to flee to the wilderness to save his life. When our vanguard troops arrived, he jumped out of the rice paddies and volunteered to be a local guide.
    People like Wu Yayin were not just a few in this area, but numbered in the thousands. When our good people were oppressed by the bandits until they could hardly breathe, they could only rise up and fight them desperately. Today, seeing their own regular army arrive, they were even more fearless. People can also understand from this why the guerrilla movement in the Guangdong area developed so rapidly during the three short years of the People's Liberation War.
　　VI. Watering Horses on the Banks of the Pearl River
    After our army fiercely annihilated the 271st and 273rd Regiments of the bandit army's 39th Army, and captured 700 bandit soldiers alive, we pursued them overnight to Pajiang Station. From then on, we escaped the mountainous areas of northern Guangdong and gradually entered the hilly areas of central Guangdong, which made it easier for our army to deploy and fight. The bandit army probably saw this as well and learned their lesson from the previous battles. Before our troops arrived, they blew up the iron bridge and stationed themselves on the small hills on the south bank of the Bei River, "keeping watch" for the bandit leaders who were moving their belongings from Guangzhou. On the afternoon of the 13th, seeing our large army pouring in, they fled south in panic. Our vanguard troops immediately crossed the river and followed, chasing them all the way to Yuantan Station, throwing the bandit army's 23rd Army and four other regiments into complete disarray. In addition to the regimental commander and 200 others killed by us, and more than a thousand captured alive, the rest fled into the mountains or ran for their lives along the railway line. When our troops, replacing Regiment C as the vanguard, rushed to Yinzhan'ao Station, more than forty kilometers from Guangzhou, they rounded up many more of them.
    On the evening of the 14th, we advanced to Fengcun in the Pearl River Delta and saw a blaze of light in the sky in the direction of Guangzhou, with explosions resounding continuously. We knew that the Fourth Field Army had advanced along the Yuegan Highway to the outskirts of Guangzhou, and the bandit troops were retreating after sabotaging the area. Our soldiers were extremely excited and rushed south overnight in order to cooperate with the brotherly troops to cut off the Guangzhou-Sanshui Railway and strike at the enemy fleeing west.
    In this extremely tense pursuit battle, people couldn't even keep track of the days. When the morning breeze blew across the southern fields and the troops rested briefly on the road, the comrades from the Political Department who were helping with the work had to write a report and had to correct the date together.
    Suddenly, there was a situation ahead. A company of bandit troops wanted to surrender. At this time, another group of bandit troops appeared on the east side, all defeated soldiers from the four regiments pursued and annihilated at Pajiang. Now, wearing their hats askew, they walked over docilely to surrender.
    Our soldiers said, "Where can you escape to? Everywhere is our People's Liberation Army!"

    ——记广州战役的一个侧面

　　四　攻夺遥步大铁桥
    部队又连续行进一昼两夜之后，九日下午一时到达英德以北二十五里的河头墟。听游击队同志们说：英德车站以南至遥步大铁桥间有匪军一团人，是从曲江逃下来的；车站上还停着一列空火车，企图在“固守”不住车站时撤到＠江南岸，炸断粤汉路南段最大一座铁桥——遥步墟大铁桥，凭险与我军对抗。
    听到这个消息，部队顿时精神百倍：“我们天明黑夜走路就是为的找他们算帐，好容易碰到这样的机会。”我们的指战员生怕敌人跑掉了，马不停蹄地前进。在一个离英德车站不远的板树坡上安置下团指挥所，迅速地完成战斗部署。这是一个十分英明的作战计划：用强大部队从左右两翼迂回到敌人侧背，然后以重火力沿铁路正面压迫，趁匪军措手不及时将其消灭在＠江北岸，以便夺取大铁桥。
    下午四时四十分，正当我们“九一”式步兵炮被调到前方的时候，英德车站方面已接上了火。我们师部侦察队的英雄们出敌不意降临到他们的“营盘”里，打了个痛快仗。向以攻坚闻名的九连急步抢进。“跟我来！”二排长共产党员李好峰，带领突击队冲上桥去，被敌桥头堡垒里射出的子弹击伤；一排长王长水即急步赶上，带头攻占北面的桥头堡垒，不幸一颗子弹从他腹中穿过，我们优秀的无产阶级先锋队员英勇地牺牲了！一排副郑天富又立即接上，“冲呀！”，我们的英雄们象一股旋风似地卷过桥去，桥那边蒋匪军还以为是他们自己撤下来的人，连问：“谁？谁？”一排副郑天富和战斗英雄邓新成九个人一梭机枪扫去，把敌人打得丧魂失魄地四处逃窜。那条一直接到桥中心连接二百斤黄色炸药电发管的引线，仍安然无恙地躺在那里，一排副和卫生员李文生敏捷地从两头把它剪断了。
　　五　乡导吴亚银
    在攻夺长达二百六十公尺的遥步大铁桥时，有一个身着黑色衣服的壮年农民夹在我们行列里飞奔前进。战斗结束时，他生擒两个匪军，缴获了三枝步枪和一挺机关枪。他名叫吴亚银，是英德县属再＠②乡菜州村人，离这里有十多里，前两天家里东西被匪军抢走，老婆被拉去当“挑夫”，自己则被迫跑到野地来逃命，当我们先头部队抵达时，他从水田里跳出来自告奋勇当乡导。
    象吴亚银这样的人，在这一带何只千百个。我们善良的人民被匪帮压榨得喘不过气来的时候，只有起来和他拚命，今日看到自己的正规军来了，自己更无所畏惧了，人们也可以从这里理解到为什么短短三年的人民解放战争中，广东一带的游击运动开展得这样迅速的道理。
　　六　饮马珠江滨
    我军痛歼匪军三十九军二七一和二七三两个团，生俘匪军七百人之后，又连夜追至琶江车站，自此即脱出粤北山地，逐渐进到粤中丘陵地带，更便于我军展开作战了。匪军大概也看到这点，并在上几次作战中学乖了，不等我们部队到来便把铁桥炸毁，驻在琶江南岸的小山陵上，替广州搬家的匪首们“放风”。十三日下午，看到我们大军源源涌进，便怆惶南窜。我们先头部队马上渡江跟进，一直追到源潭车站，把匪军二十三军等四团人追得晕头转向，除被我打死团长以下二百，生俘千多人外，其余钻山的钻山，沿铁路线奔命的奔命。接替丙团担任前卫的我军部队连夜赶至距广州四十多公里的银盏坳车站时，又收拾了他们好多人。
    十四日晚我们进至珠江三角洲的冯村，看到广州方向天空上一片火光，爆破声连成巨响，知道四野的部队已经沿粤赣公路挺进至广州近郊，匪军正作破坏后的撤退。我们的战士兴奋万分，连夜向南赶进，以便配合兄弟部队切断广（州）三（水）铁路，戳击西逃之敌。
    在这段万分紧张的追击战中，人们连日子都计算不清了。当晨风吹拂着南方的田野，部队在路上稍稍歇息下来，骡马痛饮着珠江流水的时候，政治部下去帮助工作的同志要写报告，不得不几个人在一起订正着日期。
    突然前面有了情况，有一连匪军要投降。这时候，东边又出现了一股匪军，全是琶江被追歼的四团匪军溃兵。现在歪戴着帽，驯服地走过来投降。
    我们的战士们说：“你们逃到那里去，到处都是我们人民解放军！”
