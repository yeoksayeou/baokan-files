    An American missionary, running from Yunnan to Hong Kong, said that in a missionary meeting, he asked his Chinese Christian followers a question: "What is the worst thing in the world?" According to him, he hoped the answer would be: "Sin." But the reality was too "disappointing" for him. The Christian followers answered in unison:
    "Chennault."
    This "disappointment" is somewhat "superfluous" because this answer, if one were to seek more logical rigor, could naturally be revised to: "Chennault is one of them." But even the original answer has nothing "disappointing" about it, because it is in accordance with the facts. Doesn't "God" teach people to be honest in their speech? "Chennault" can indeed serve as a synonym for sin, as he, to this day, is still directly participating in the "cause" of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang in its enmity with the Chinese people.
    So, why should this American missionary be "disappointed"? It is because the Chinese people have recognized the truth, and it seems he also has a part in Chennault's sinful "cause."

    一位美国的传教士，从云南跑到香港去，说是他在一个传教会上，对中国的老百姓当中的教友们提出一个问题：“世界上最坏的东西是什么？”，据他说，他希望得到的回答是：“罪恶”，但事实太使他“失望”了，教友们异口同声的回答是：
    “陈纳德。”
    这“失望”是有些“多余”的，因为这个答案，假如要在逻辑上求其更严密一些的话，自然也可以修正为：“陈纳德就是其中的一个。”但，就是原答案也并没有可以使人“失望”之处，因为那是合乎事实的。“上帝”不是教人说话要诚实吗？“陈纳德”，确实可以作罪恶的代名词，他，到目前为止，还在直接参加蒋介石匪帮与中国人民为敌的“事业”。
    那末，这位美国传教士，为什要“失望”呢？那是因为中国人民已认清了真理，而陈纳德的罪恶“事业”中，又好象也有自己一份儿的缘故。
