　　Masses Enthusiastically Participate in Sanitation Campaign
  　Sanitation Groups Universally Established in Beijing
    Large Quantities of Garbage and Manure Removed Completely General Sanitation Inspection Underway
    [Beijing News] The sanitation campaign launched by the Beijing Municipal Epidemic Prevention Committee recently came to a conclusion. In addition to the removal of approximately 14,000 tons of accumulated garbage from households and streets throughout the city, people's sanitation groups, generally consisting of ten households each, have been universally established throughout the city. In the twelve districts of the inner and outer city alone, there are 12,645 sanitation groups. The main task of these groups is to maintain cleanliness. Concurrent with the sanitation campaign, the Civil Affairs Bureau carried out work-relief projects to repair earthen roads in major hutongs and street sidewalks. The Construction Bureau carried out projects to dredge dark ditches. The Health Bureau and the Manure Disposal Office also mobilized manure workers and merchants to strengthen the cleaning of manure from public and private toilets and to pay attention to collecting scattered manure from roadsides and alleys. 606 manure pits were filled, 130 manure boxes were removed, 154 manure factories were eliminated, and 284,400 jin of liquid manure, 37,500 jin of dry manure, and 11,500 jin of grass manure were cleaned up. A general inspection of sanitation conditions is currently underway.
    In this sanitation campaign, the laboring people were the most active. For example, Grandma Su from No. 5 Hutong in the Sixth District, the mother of a pedicab worker, not only sweeps her own yard every day but also helps others sweep and explains the principles of sanitation to others. She is known as a sanitation model by everyone and is now the head of the sanitation group. There are many such activists in all districts.
    Although the environmental sanitation of the city has reached the above level, some problems still exist. For example, the treatment of sewage and manure still needs to be resolved urgently. The Health Bureau built 30 new sewage pools and repaired 53 sewage pools in November. Taking Chaoyangmen Street as an example, there are four sewage pools on one street. However, in terms of the entire city, some citizens still have nowhere to dump sewage. There are also many difficulties in the treatment of manure. At the Second Session of the Beijing Municipal People's Congress, Mayor Nie has put forward the construction of sewers and environmental sanitation as important tasks for future municipal construction. The Municipal Construction Bureau and the Health Bureau have also put forward specific work plans for carrying out these two tasks in 1950. In the future, the people of the city, the heads of sanitation groups, and municipal cadres must continue to work hard to further improve the sanitation of the capital.

　　群众热情参加清洁运动
  　京市普建卫生小组
    大批垃圾粪便运除净尽  正进行清洁卫生总检查
    【北京讯】北京市防疫委员会所发动的清洁运动，最近已告一段落。除了全市户内及街巷间积存的垃圾约计一万四千吨已经运除外，全市已经普遍建立了一般以十户为一组的人民卫生小组，仅仅城厢十二区的卫生小组就有一万二千六百四十五个。这些小组以保洁为主要工作。与清洁运动进行的同时，市民政局进行了以工代赈，修整各主要胡同土路与各街边道的工程，建设局进行了掏挖暗沟的工程，卫生局和处理粪便事务所也动员了粪工、粪商加强公私厕所的粪便打扫清除工作和注意捡拾路旁巷口的零散粪便。填平了全市六百零六个粪坑，清除了一百三十个粪箱，一五四处粪厂，二十八万四千四百斤粪稀，三万七千五百斤粪干和一万一千五百斤草粪。目前正进行清洁卫生状况的总检查。
    在这次清洁运动里，越是劳动人民，越积极。如六区五所胡同的苏大妈是一位三轮工人的母亲，她不但每天清扫自己的院子，还帮助别人扫地，给别人讲清洁卫生的道理，被大家称为清洁模范，现在又当了卫生小组长。象这样的积极分子，各区全都不少。
    本市的环境卫生虽已达到上述程度，但仍然存在着一些问题，譬如秽水和粪便的处理，还是亟待解决的。卫生局在十一月间曾新建秽水池三十个，整修秽水池五十三个，以朝阳门大街为例，一条街上即有四个秽水池。但以全市范围讲，还有部分市民无处倒秽水。粪便的处理，亦存在不少困难。在北京市第二届人民代表会议上，聂市长已把下水道的建设与环境卫生工作作为今后市政建设的重要工作提出来。市建设局和卫生局也提出了一九五○年进行这两项工作的具体工作计划。今后仍须全市人民、各卫生小组长，与市政干部的继续努力，更进一步搞好首都的卫生工作。
