Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, November 1st: Shanghai's ample coal supply and increasing coal reserves month by month represent a major victory in crushing the enemy's naval blockade. Currently, the East China Coal Industry General Company in Shanghai has a stockpile of over 164,800 tons of coal, an unprecedented figure for Shanghai's coal reserves in recent years. Coal is a crucial power resource for Shanghai's industry and public utilities, requiring approximately 160,000 tons per month. Before liberation, Shanghai's coal supply largely depended on Kailuan and Taiwan, both transported by sea. When the Military Control Commission took over Shanghai, the existing coal reserves were only sufficient to supply the city for one week. Supplying coal to Shanghai became the most urgent problem. Although the Military Control Commission had made preparations before entering the city, and the East China Support-the-Front Headquarters took responsibility for transporting coal continuously, the sea routes were obstructed due to the enemy's blockade, and the Tianjin-Pukou Railway was not open to traffic, preventing Kailuan coal from being transported south temporarily. Although Jiawang coal from Xuzhou could be transported, the section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway south of Xuzhou was damaged by fleeing Kuomintang bandits, requiring manual labor with small carts for coal transport, indicating the difficulty of the situation. As a result, the coal supply in Shanghai could hardly meet the demand. At the most critical moment, the coal reserves were only sufficient for two days' consumption in the city. However, with the active support of the people in various regions in transporting coal, the coal supply was never interrupted. After the Tianjin-Pukou Railway was opened to traffic, Kailuan coal was transported south in a continuous stream, and Shanghai's coal supply gradually became abundant, with coal reserves increasing month by month. Excluding privately operated coal sales, the East China Coal Industry General Company's transport, sales, and inventory figures have increased monthly since June. In June, approximately 30,000 tons were transported, with 48,000 tons sold including existing reserves, leaving 12,000 tons in reserve. In July, over 71,000 tons were transported, with over 72,000 tons sold, leaving 17,000 tons in reserve. In August, over 141,000 tons were transported, with over 115,000 tons sold, leaving over 45,000 tons in reserve. In September, over 178,000 tons were transported, with over 100,200 tons sold, leaving over 119,000 tons in reserve. The statistics for October only cover the period up to the 24th, with over 121,000 tons transported, over 73,000 tons sold, and reserves reaching over 164,000 tons. The reason for the monthly increase in sales figures is that Shanghai's industry is gradually recovering, and factories are using more coal. The slightly lower sales figures in September and October compared to August are due to the coal supply becoming normal, and people no longer finding it necessary to purchase and stockpile large quantities.

### 粉碎敌人封锁重大胜利　上海燃煤供应充裕　储煤量逐月增多

　　粉碎敌人封锁重大胜利
  　上海燃煤供应充裕
  　储煤量逐月增多
    【新华社上海一日电】上海燃煤供应充足，存煤量逐月增多，是粉碎敌人海上封锁的重大胜利之一。目前沪市华东煤业总公司积存煤达十六万四千八百余吨，这是近年来上海储煤量的空前数字。煤为上海工业和公用事业的重要动力资源，每月约需十六万吨。解放前，上海燃煤大部仰给于开滦和台湾，均系由海道运来。上海解放时，军管会接收的存煤仅足供应全市一周所需。一时运煤供应上海成为最迫切的问题。军管会于入城前虽预有准备，入城后又由华东支援前线司令部负责运煤源源供应。但因海道由于敌人的封锁受阻，津浦路未通车，开滦煤一时无法南运。徐州贾汪煤虽可运来，而津浦路南段遭国民党溃匪破坏的一段，运煤时须用人力小车接运，其困难情形可知。以致上海燃煤供难应求，最危急时，存煤仅够全市两天所需。但在各地人民积极运煤的支援下，煤的供应始终未断。津浦通车后，开滦煤源源南运，沪市来煤始日益充裕，存煤逐月增多。除私营运销的煤斤外，华东煤业总公司自六月以来，煤的运销积存数字均逐月增加。计六月份运到约三万吨，连存煤售出四万八千吨，存一万二千吨；七月份运到七万一千多吨，售出七万二千多吨，存一万七千吨；八月份运到十四万一千多吨，售出十一万五千多吨，存四万五千多吨；九月份运到十七万八千多吨，售出十万零二千多吨，存十一万九千多吨；十月仅二十四日以前的统计；运来十二万一千多吨，售出七万三千多吨，积存达十六万四千多吨。售出数字逐月增加的原因，系由于上海工业逐渐恢复，工厂用煤增多。九、十月售出数字较八月略低，则由于煤的供应已趋正常，人民已没有多购积存的必要。
