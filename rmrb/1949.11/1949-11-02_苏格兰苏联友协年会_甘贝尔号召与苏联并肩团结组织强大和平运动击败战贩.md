Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 1st: According to a TASS report from Glasgow: The annual meeting of the Scottish-Soviet Friendship Association was held in Glasgow on October 29th. Nearly 400 representatives attended, representing the association's total membership of 3,043. The conference received a large number of congratulatory messages from pro-Soviet friendship associations in Poland, Czechoslovakia, Norway, Korea, France, Romania, and other countries. The Australian-Soviet Friendship Association, the New Zealand-Soviet Friendship Association, the Irish-Soviet Friendship Association, the Anglo-Soviet Friendship Association, and British trade unions all sent representatives to the conference. An exhibition of Soviet economic and cultural achievements was set up at the conference venue, which aroused great interest among the representatives and guests.

Campbell, President of the Scottish-Soviet Friendship Association, delivered the opening speech. He emphasized that the convening of this conference was not only to discuss the association's activities over the past year but also to commemorate the 32nd anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution in the Soviet Union. He pointed out that in the past 32 years, all of the Soviet Union's activities have been the great struggle of the Soviet people to win world peace. Vyshinsky's famous speech at the opening of the United Nations General Assembly in New York reflected the thoughts and emotions of hundreds of millions of ordinary men and women around the world. Vyshinsky had every reason to speak on behalf of the people, while Bevin and McNeil spoke on behalf of the warmongers.

When mentioning the achievements of the Soviet people in peaceful construction, Campbell said: The living standards in the Soviet Union are gradually improving, while the living standards in the United Kingdom are declining sharply. He pointed out that the achievements of the Soviet Union are a thorn in the side of the US-British ruling clique and the US-British bourgeois press. Therefore, we see a frantic anti-Soviet movement in newspapers and on the radio. However, the people of Britain and the United States understand that the Soviet Union is a country that resolutely defends peace.

Campbell said: We must stand shoulder to shoulder with the people of the Soviet Union and the people of other countries to defend peace. For this purpose, we must organize a strong peace movement to overthrow the plans of the warmongers. The British miners, through their representatives at the London Peace Conference, recently stated that they refuse to produce a ton of coal for the anti-Soviet war. Similarly, the machinists have also decided not to produce a nail for the anti-Soviet war. The Bellis mixed machinists' local committee near Glasgow stated this in a resolution months ago. Now, I urge typesetters and all workers in printing houses and publishing houses not to print a word that slanders our great friend—the Soviet Union. The entire audience enthusiastically cheered Campbell's speech.

Thomas Murray, Secretary-General of the Association, said when reporting on the work of the General Association: No country in the world can survive and prosper without friendship with the Soviet Union. He said: The loss of extensive trade between Britain and the Soviet Union will first affect the entire shipbuilding industry in Scotland, which is now in a serious crisis.

　　苏格兰苏联友协年会
  　甘贝尔号召与苏联并肩团结组织强大和平运动击败战贩
    【新华社北京一日电】据塔斯社格拉斯哥讯：苏格兰——苏联友好协会年会，于十月二十九日在格拉斯哥举行。出席者有代表该会三千零四十三名全会的代表近四百人。大会收到波兰、捷克、挪威、朝鲜、法国、罗马尼亚及其他各国对苏友好协会的大批贺电，澳大利亚——苏联友好协会、新西兰——苏联友好协会、爱尔兰——苏联友好协会、英苏友好协会以及英国的工会并均派有代表参加大会。大会会场布置了苏联经济与文化成就的展览，引起了代表和来宾们极大的兴趣。
    苏格兰——苏联友好协会总会会长甘贝尔致开会词。他着重指出：本届大会之召集，不但为了讨论协会过去一年内的活动，也是为了纪念苏联伟大的十月社会主义革命的三十二周年。他指出：在过去三十二年中，苏联的全部活动始终是苏联人民为争取世界和平的伟大斗争。维辛斯基在纽约联合国大会开幕时所发表的著名演说，反映了世界各地亿万普通男女的思想和情绪。维辛斯基有一切根据是代表人民说话，而贝文及麦克奈尔则是代表战争贩子说话。
    当提到苏联人民在和平建设中的成就时，甘贝尔说：苏联的生活程度逐步提高，而英国的生活程度却在急剧下降。他指出：苏联的成就是美英统治集团和美英的资产阶级报纸的眼中钉。因此，我们看到报纸和广播中疯狂的反苏运动。可是，英国和美国的人民了解苏联是坚决地保卫和平的国家。
    甘贝尔说：我们必须和苏联人民及其他国家的人民并肩团结，保卫和平。为了这个目的，我们必须组织强有力的和平运动，推翻战争贩子的计划。英国的矿工们，最近通过他们在伦敦和平大会的代表，表示他们拒绝为反苏战争生产一吨煤。同样地，机器工人们也决定不为反苏战争生产一枚钉子，格拉斯哥附近倍利斯的混合机器工会地方委员会在数月前的决议中就声明了这一点。现在，我劝排字工人和印刷所和出版所的一切工人，不要印一个诽谤我们伟大的朋友——苏联——的字。全体听众热烈地向甘贝尔的演说欢呼。
    协会秘书长汤玛斯·莫莱在报告总会的工作时说：世界上任何一个国家不与苏联友好就不能生存和繁荣。他说：丧失了英苏之间的广泛贸易，首先就影响全部苏格兰的造船业，造船业现在正处于严重的危机中。
