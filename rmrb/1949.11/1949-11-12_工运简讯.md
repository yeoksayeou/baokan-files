    Labor Movement Briefs
    Tianjin
    Qiu Jin, Vice Chairman of the Tianjin Federation of Trade Unions Preparatory Committee, reported at the fourth preparatory committee meeting a few days ago that trade unions in Tianjin had recruited nearly 170,000 members from June to September this year, the vast majority of whom were industrial workers. The organized workers account for more than 80% of the total number of workers in the city, and branches have been established in all major factories. At present, except for maritime workers, all other industrial workers in Tianjin have established their own trade unions. Therefore, Tianjin's trade union work has basically completed the task of "first organizing industrial workers." To this end, the Tianjin Federation of Trade Unions Preparatory Committee decided to convene the first city-wide member representative meeting in the near future to formally establish the Tianjin Federation of Trade Unions.
    Shanghai
    The Hangzhou Branch of the Shanghai Railway Trade Union was officially established on the 30th of last month. At present, there are 7,218 trade union members on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, accounting for more than 60% of the 11,583 workers on the entire railway. Trade unions have been established in 31 of the 36 units along the railway.

    工运简讯
    天津
    天津市总工会筹委会副主席丘金，日前在第四次筹委会议上报告：天津市各工会，在今年六月至九月四个月中，共吸收会员近十七万人，其中绝大部分是产业工人。组织起来的工人，已约占全市工人总数的百分之八十以上，各大工厂都已有了分会的组织。目前除海员工人外，天津其他产业工人都已建立起自己的工会。因此，天津市的工会工作，基本上完成了“首先把产业工人组织起来”的任务。天津市总工会筹委会为此决定在短期内召开全市首届会员代表大会，正式成立天津市总工会。
    上海
    上海区铁路工会杭州分会已于上月三十日正式成立。现在浙赣铁路已有工会会员七千二百十八人，占全路工人一万一千五百八十三人的百分之六十以上。全路三十六个单位中，已有三十一个单位建立了工会。
