　　Beat the Dog in the Water
    Ping Yuan
    Beating the dog makes it bark loudly,
    It has already fled to the seaside!
    Chase after it,
    Don't let it escape through its crotch!
    Add another rifle butt,
    And it will somersault!
    Beating the dog makes it whine,
    It has already fled to Taiwan!
    Chase after it,
    Don't let it hide in the Yankee chimney!
    One rifle butt per person,
    Beat it down into the water so it won't bark again!
    Beating the dog makes it no longer bark,
    It has already fallen into the water;
    Watch it:
    Don't let it pop its head up to blow bubbles!
    Beat the dog in the water to the very end,
    The Chinese people will no longer be bitten by vicious dogs!
    　　　　　October 6th, Nanjing

　　打落水狗
    平原
    打狗打得旺旺叫，
    已经逃到海边了！
    追上去，
    不要让它从裤裆弄里逃走掉！
    再加一枪托，
    一个筋斗就翻倒！
    打狗打得呜呜叫，
    已经逃到台湾了！
    追过去，
    不要让它躲到花旗烟囱里逃走掉！
    一人一枪托，
    打倒水里不再叫！
    打狗打得不再叫，
    已经落到水里了；
    看住它：
    不要让它冒出头来吹气泡！
    落水狗要打到底，
    中国人民从此不被恶狗咬！
