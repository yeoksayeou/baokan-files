[Reported by this newspaper] Under the leadership and assistance of governments at all levels, the people of Henan Province have continuously waged arduous struggles against various disasters. Except for a few areas where the harvest was poor due to severe flooding, the early autumn sorghum and millet harvests were generally very good in most areas. The late autumn harvest averaged around 50-60% due to more than twenty days of autumn rain. Industrial crops such as cotton, taro leaves, and peanuts are also beginning to be harvested. New cotton has already been put on the market in some areas.

The entire process of agricultural production in Henan this year has been a process of fighting against disasters such as floods, droughts, wind, sand, hail, and insect pests. Last winter and this spring, 90% of Henan Province was liberated, but due to the devastation of the Kuomintang bandit gangs, rampant bandits, and the disastrous flooding of the Yellow River and other rivers, a severe famine was created this spring. On the one hand, governments at all levels mobilized the masses to carry out anti-bandit and anti-despot struggles to stabilize rural social order; on the other hand, they organized the masses to develop production. For areas with more serious disasters, the government also issued large amounts of grain and funds to help disaster victims solve the difficulties of eating and seeds, and used the method of "work-for-relief" to mobilize the masses to dredge rivers and repair dikes. In Xuchang, Huaiyang, Chenliu, Luoyang and other regions alone, more than 10 million catties of grain were allocated this spring, dredging 52 large and small rivers, rescuing more than 1.5 million mu of flooded fields, and timely planting spring wheat and autumn crops.

However, in April and May, after the early autumn seedlings emerged, there was a prolonged drought in various places, and some seedlings withered. In Chenliu Prefecture, wind and sand accumulated, making it impossible to sow late autumn crops. In order to overcome the drought, governments at all levels led and organized farmers to sink wells, dig ponds, and irrigate and sow. In windy and sandy areas, sand dunes were leveled and peanuts were replanted. By mid-June, there was widespread rain in various places, and the People's Government immediately seized the opportunity to lend a large amount of seeds and mobilized the poor and rich to borrow and help each other, solving the production difficulties of poor farmers. In Chenliu Prefecture alone, more than one million catties of seeds were loaned, allowing the affected seedlings to be quickly replanted.

After mid-July, there were continuous cloudy and rainy days in Henan, and the water level in various rivers rose sharply, with dike breaches in many areas. In particular, within the Xuchang Prefecture, 17 breaches occurred in 12 rivers, and the affected area in seven counties including Yanling and Yancheng reached more than 255,000 mu. After the floods occurred, the prefectural commissioners' offices and county governments immediately led the farmers to repair river dikes, block breaches, and dig ditches for drainage. By the beginning of August, most of the crops had been saved, and the accumulated water had been largely drained. Only a few areas suffered partial losses due to flood damage. At the same time, locusts, nymphs, and red spiders occurred successively in Huaiyang, Xuchang, Chenliu, Luoyang and other regions. The locusts and nymphs spread extremely quickly, but after the People's Government mobilized the masses to fight hard, they were quickly wiped out. In addition, Weishi and other counties suffered hail disasters. After the People's Government provided loans and assistance, they also replanted late autumn crops.

In mid-to-late August, early autumn crops matured in various places, and by early September, they had been successfully harvested, generally yielding 70% of a normal harvest. However, since late September, when late autumn crops were just maturing and had not yet been harvested, various places suffered more severe flooding than in July. Continuous rain lasted for more than twenty days, with breaches and overflows in many rivers. Generally, low-lying areas also formed severe floods due to the accumulated water not receding. According to statistics from Xuchang, Shangqiu, Xinyang and other six prefectures alone, more than 6 million mu of crops were flooded; in areas that were not flooded, the ripening crops experienced phenomena such as shattering, germination, and mold due to prolonged rain. After more than a month of rescue by party, government, army and people in various places, most of the crops immersed in the water have been salvaged. The Shangqiu Prefectural Commissioner's Office also dug more than 350 drainage ditches, rescuing more than 2 million mu of farmland. At present, with the exception of some soybeans and peanuts being harvested, other late autumn crops have been harvested. The total amount of ginned cotton that can be harvested in the Chenliu Prefecture is more than 42 million catties, and the peanut yield is about 100 million catties.

　　克服各种严重灾害后
  　河南各地完成秋收
    早秋作物收成好晚秋平均五六成
    工业作物正开始收割新棉已上市
    【本报讯】河南全省人民在各级人民政府的领导和扶助下，曾不断地和各种灾害进行了艰苦的斗争，除少数地区因水灾较重而歉收外，一般地区早秋高粱、谷子等收成甚佳，晚秋由于二十多天的秋雨侵害，收成平均在五、六成左右。棉花、芋叶、花生等工业作物也正开始收割。部分地区新棉已经上市。
    今年河南农业生产的全部过程，就是和水灾、旱灾、风沙、冰雹、虫害等灾斗争的过程。去冬今春，河南全省占百分之九十的地区宣告解放，但由于国民党匪帮的摧残，土匪横行，黄河及其他河流的泛滥成灾，造成了今春的严重灾荒。各级人民政府一面发动群众进行反土匪反恶霸斗争，稳定农村社会秩序；一面组织群众开展生产。对灾情较严重地区，政府又贷发了大批粮款，帮助灾民解决吃粮、种籽等困难，并以“以工贷赈”的办法，发动群众疏河修堤，仅许昌、淮阳、陈留、洛阳等专区，今春先后拨粮达一千余万斤，疏浚大小河流五十二条，救出水淹田一百五十余万亩，并及时种上春麦和秋禾。
    但到四、五月间早秋露苗后，各地又久旱不雨，部分幼苗枯萎。陈留专区则遭风沙积压，使晚秋无法下种。各地人民政府为了克服旱灾，领导和组织农民凿井、挖塘、灌溉播种。风沙地区则铲平沙堆，补种花生。至六月中旬，各地普降透雨，人民政府又立即抓紧时机，大量贷种，并发动贫富互借互济，解决了贫苦农民的生产困难。仅陈留专区即贷种达百万余斤，使受害的苗得以迅速补种。
    七月中旬以后，河南境内阴雨连绵，各河水势暴涨，不少地区河堤决口成灾。特别是许昌专区境内，十二条河流决口十七处，其中鄢陵、郾城等七县受灾面积达二十五万五千余亩。各地专署、县政府于水灾发生后，立即领导农民进行抢修河堤、堵塞决口、挖沟排水。到八月初，大部田禾得救，积水亦大体排除，仅有少数地区因遭洪水冲毁而受到部分损失。与此同时，淮阳、许昌、陈留、洛阳等专区又先后发生了蝗蝻和红蜘蛛等虫害。蝗蝻蔓延极快，经人民政府动员群众努力扑打后，亦已迅速扑灭。此外，尉氏等县并受到冰雹的灾害，经人民政府贷款扶助后，也都补种了晚秋作物。
    八月中下旬，各地早秋已熟，至九月初，已顺利收获完毕，一般有七成年景。但自九月下旬晚秋刚熟尚未收割时，各地又遭受较七月间更严重的水灾，霪雨连绵达二十余日，不少河流决口、漫水，一般低洼地区亦因积水不退，酿成严重水灾。仅许昌、商邱、信阳等六个专区统计，受淹田禾即达六百余万亩；未淹地区亦因久雨不晴，使刚熟之庄稼发生脱粒、生芽、霉烂等现象。经各地党政军民月余的抢救，浸于水中的作物已大部捞出。商邱专署并挖掘排水沟三百五十余条，救出田禾二百余万亩。目前除分部黄豆、花生正在抢收外，其他晚秋都已收割完毕。陈留专区全区可收净棉四千二百余万斤，花生产量约一亿余斤左右。
