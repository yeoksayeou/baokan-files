　　To thoroughly solve the living and production difficulties of the vast number of disaster victims in severely flooded areas, the Hebei Provincial People's Government and the Tianjin Prefectural Office established a joint immigration office to handle immigration to the Northeast. The first group of 1,300 disaster victims from Tianjin Prefecture was sent to Heilongjiang Province in Northeast China on a special train on the 19th. Upon arrival, every six households of disaster victims will receive six horses, a large cart, and a Western-style plow for cultivation borrowed from the local People's Government, as well as food rations for eight to ten months. However, due to insufficient understanding of the farmers' strong attachment to their homeland and insufficient in-depth publicity and education work, many farmers still have concerns about moving to the Northeast, which has affected the progress of the immigration work. The immigration office and the Tianjin Prefectural Office have therefore re-instructed all counties to earnestly carry out immigration work, strengthen publicity and education, resolutely prevent coercion and commandism, and mobilize village cadres and party members to take the lead in moving. Local cooperatives fairly and reasonably purchase the belongings that the disaster victims cannot take away under the condition of no loss, and supply necessities at relatively cheap prices. After the disaster victims arrive in the Northeast, they are mobilized to write more letters to report the situation of the move to their relatives and friends in their hometowns, in order to strengthen the immigration work.

　　天津专区解决灾民困难
　　首批灾民移往东北
　　东北各地政府妥善安置
    【本报讯】为彻底解决水灾严重地区广大灾民的生活生产困难，河北省人民政府与天津专署建立联合移民办事处，办理向东北移民工作，天津专区首批灾民一千三百人，已于十九日专车送往东北黑龙江省。到后，每六户灾民，即可得到当地人民政府借给六匹马，一辆大车，和一架开荒用的洋犁，并贷给八个月到十个月食粮。但由于对农民浓厚的乡土观念认识不足，与宣传教育工作的不够深入，致使许多农民对移往东北仍有顾虑。以致影响了移民工作的进展。移民办事处及天津专署，为此曾特再次指示各县认真进行移民工作，加强宣传教育，坚决防止强迫命令，发动村干、党员带头移往。各地合作社在不亏损条件下，公平合理收购灾民不能带走的财物，并以比较便宜的价钱供给必需品。在灾民到达东北后，发动灾民多写信报告家乡亲友移往情况，以加强移民工作。
