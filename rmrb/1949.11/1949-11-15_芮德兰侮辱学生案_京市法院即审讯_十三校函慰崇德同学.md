    Redland Insulting Students Case
    Beijing Municipal Court to Conduct Trial
    Thirteen Schools Send Letters of Condolences to Chongde Students
    [Beijing News] The Beijing Municipal People's Court has accepted the case of Chongde Middle School student Lu Zuyi and others suing Redland for insulting and spitting on them. A special investigator was sent to the school to conduct an on-site investigation.

    Redland, an English teacher of British nationality at Chongde Middle School, verbally abused student Lu Zuyi on the 8th of this month, and spat on students Tan Yu, Li Shaokang, Kang Lun, Bai Lianji, and others, and openly insulted the Chinese people. After the incident, five students, including Lu Zuyi, entrusted three students from the school, Tan Enpu, Zhou Luoliang, and Zhang Wencai, as their agents, and filed a lawsuit with the Municipal People's Court on the 12th. After the court accepted the case, it dispatched acting trial judge Peng Chen to Chongde Middle School yesterday (14th) to conduct an on-site investigation, and summoned the plaintiff, defendant, student representatives, and school leaders for questioning. The defendant, Redland, has consistently insulted and verbally abused students. At the beginning of this semester, she cursed Ji Rongtang, a first-year high school student, in the same manner. Two years ago, Redland also beat the five- or six-year-old child of Wang Junquan, a worker at the school, believing that she had the right to beat the child of her servant. Student Song Zhensui, because he was nearsighted and did not wear glasses, sat in the front row of the classroom. Redland grabbed Song's ear and dragged him to the back of the classroom, and also hit him. The results of the investigation showed that the defendant, Redland’s insult to students and the Chinese people this time was not accidental, but her consistent behavior. The court is now studying the relevant materials of this case and has decided to open a court session for trial within the next few days.
    [This Newspaper's Report] After the incident of Redland, a British teacher at Beijing Chongde Middle School, openly insulting students occurred, more than 30 representatives of teachers, students, and workers from seven schools in Beijing, including Beiman, Muzhen, Huiwen, Chongci, Duzhi, Chongshi, and Yuying, held a meeting at Beiman Middle School yesterday (14th) afternoon. At the meeting, Chairman Sun Niantai reported on the incident. Representatives from various schools spoke one after another, unanimously protesting the arrogant behavior of imperialist elements and demanding that the People's Court severely punish them. The meeting unanimously passed a letter of condolence to the students of Chongde, which stated in brief: Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the Chinese people have stood up! Imperialists are not allowed to run rampant on Chinese territory again. The people's democratic dictatorship's laws are precisely to protect the freedom and happiness of the people and are a tool of sanction against reactionaries. We demand that the People's Court severely punish the crimes of imperialist elements. Redland's provocative behavior of hatred towards the Chinese people is another education for "democratic individualists," telling them that true friendship comes from the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries, while imperialism only gives us oppression and insult. All teachers, students, and staff of the seven schools unanimously protested the arrogant behavior of Redland, an imperialist element, and will do their utmost to support the just accusations of the students of Chongde Middle School!
    [Another Dispatch] All the students of six schools in Beijing, including Shengxin Boys' Middle School, Shengxin Girls' Middle School, Fu Jen Boys' Middle School, Fu Jen Girls' Middle School, Youzhen Girls' Middle School, and Guanghua Girls' Middle School, also sent a joint letter to the students of Chongde on the 13th regarding the Redland incident of insulting the students of Chongde, expressing their condolences and support.

    芮德兰侮辱学生案
    京市法院即审讯
    十三校函慰崇德同学
    【北京讯】北京市人民法院受理崇德中学学生卢祖翼等控诉芮德兰辱骂、唾吐的侮辱案，特派员前往该校实地调查。
    崇德中学英籍英语教员芮德兰于本月八日辱骂该校学生卢祖翼、唾吐学生檀煜、李绍康、康仑、白连集等，并公然侮辱中国人民，事件发生后，该校学生卢祖翼等五人已委托该校谭恩普、周骆良、章文彩等三同学为代理人，于十二日向本市人民法院提起控诉。法院受理此案之后，特于昨（十四）日派学习审判员彭忱赴崇德中学现场调查，并传讯原被告、学生会代表及学校负责人问话。被告芮德兰一贯侮辱欺骂学生，在本学期开始，就曾这样骂过高一学生姬荣堂；在二年前芮德兰还打过该校工友王均全五、六岁的孩子，她认为她有权打她仆人的孩子。学生宋振绥因为近视没配眼镜，坐在教室前排，芮竟扯着宋的耳朵扯到教室后面，并且还打了他。经调查结果认为：被告芮德兰这次侮辱学生和中国人民不是偶然的，而是她一贯行为。法院现正研究有关此案材料，决定日内开庭审讯。
    【本报讯】北京崇德中学英籍教员芮德兰公开侮辱同学的事件发生后，京市贝满、慕贞、汇文、崇慈、笃志、崇实、育英等七个学校的教职员、学生、工友代表三十余人昨（十四）日下午在贝满中学开会，会上主席孙念台报告了事件发生经过后，各校代表纷纷发言，一致抗议帝国主义分子的蛮横行为，要求人民法院从严处置。会议一致通过了向崇德同学的慰问信，略称：中国人民在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下已经站起来了！不允许帝国主义者再在中国领土上猖獗。人民民主专政的法律正是保障人民的自由和幸福，而对反动派是一种制裁的工具。我们要求人民法院严厉制裁帝国主义分子的罪行。芮德兰仇视中国人民的挑衅行为，给“民主个人主义者”又是一次教育，告诉他们真正的友谊是来自苏联及其他人民民主国家，而帝国主义给我们的只有压迫和侮辱。七校全体师生员工，一致抗议芮德兰的帝国主义分子的蛮横行为，并尽最大力量支援崇德中学同学们的正义控诉！
    【又讯】京市盛新男中、盛新女中、辅仁男中、辅仁女中、佑贞女中、光华女中等六校全体同学，亦于十三日就芮德兰侮辱崇德同学事件，联名致函崇德同学，表示慰问与声援。
