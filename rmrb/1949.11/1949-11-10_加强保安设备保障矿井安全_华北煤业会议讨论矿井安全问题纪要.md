Strengthening Security Equipment to Ensure Mine Safety
	Minutes of the North China Coal Industry Conference Discussion on Mine Safety Issues
	By Our Reporter Shang Kai

	The coal mines of North China were long ruled and operated by Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionary government. In order to support their wars of aggression and counter-revolutionary civil war, and even more to pursue high profits, they never paid attention to the safety of workers or mine safety equipment. After the complete liberation of North China, the mines returned to the hands of the people and became people's enterprises. In order to restore and develop coal production and vigorously supply industrial construction with sufficient fuel, it is necessary to do a good job in coal mine security work and ensure that production is carried out under safe conditions.
	The North China Coal Industry Conference reviewed the coal mine security work for the first nine months of 1949 and found that the bad influences left over from the era of imperialist and Kuomintang reactionary rule had not yet been eliminated in our coal production, and various accidents and disasters, large and small, continued to occur, seriously endangering the rapid restoration and construction of the people's mines.
	The numerous large and small disasters and accidents that have occurred in various mines this year should arouse our high vigilance. They not only directly affect the lives and safety of workers, but also cause damage to local or all underground projects, causing huge losses to the people's property. Therefore, coal mine security work has both political and economic importance. The North China Coal Industry Conference conducted an in-depth review of the basic causes of disasters in various mines and repeatedly studied effective countermeasures to prevent various disasters:
	Judging from the direct causes of disasters and injuries in various mines, they are nothing more than simple equipment, poor ventilation, low scientific level of workers, and negligence. However, it can also be seen that as long as we make subjective efforts, most of these disasters can be avoided. Insufficient understanding of coal mine safety issues by the leaders of various mines, insufficient inspection, and insufficient preventive efforts are one of the basic causes of accidents and disasters. For example, after a fire occurred in the Huangtugang mine of the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau in January, the leaders did not pay attention to safety equipment, and accidents and disasters continued to occur thereafter. In order to be responsible to the workers and for the property of the state, leaders at all levels must first recognize the seriousness of this issue ideologically, oppose bureaucracy and complacency, raise the issue of coal mine safety to a matter of principle, and be determined to do a good job in coal mine security work.
	The second reason for accidents is the failure to mobilize and organize all employees to carry out mass security, turning security work into a matter for a few security personnel. This will certainly not work. The general miners have a low level of scientific knowledge, and some people are even more stubborn with their own experience, ignoring coal mine safety, and smoking with lamps at will, which often leads to underground accidents. For example, the Fengfeng Tongshun Mine is a mine with methane gas. Worker Wang Lianxi of the mine believed that he could test the methane gas situation by feeling it. He went to test the methane gas alone, and as a result, he fainted in the cave. After active rescue, he was fortunate not to be killed. In the future, it is necessary to conduct widespread security education in a planned and step-by-step manner, both to oppose paralysis and to prevent fear, to improve employees' correct understanding of security work, and to organize everyone to carry out mass security work. This is the most fundamental and effective method. After continuous accidents occurred in the small kiln of Huangtugang, Jiaozuo, the leaders paid attention to it and submitted the security issue to all employees for discussion and research. Everyone came up with solutions, formulated regulations, and divided into groups to check each other. Since its implementation, it has been very effective, and work-related injuries in September have almost disappeared.
	At present, the security organizations in various mines are mostly unsound and unscientific, security and coal mining cannot be closely coordinated, and security rules and regulations have not been seriously and thoroughly implemented, which makes coal mine safety lose its important guarantee. The conference believes that in order to change this phenomenon in the future, in addition to mobilizing the masses to organize mine security committees, it is necessary to establish a set of security organizations from the Coal Management Bureau to the underground coal mining face.
	The Mining Bureau shall set up a security section, each mine shall set up a security unit, and the coal mining area shall set up a security team and security personnel who do not leave production; each mine shall also organize a rescue team or rescue group, and equip underground on-duty medical personnel. It is also necessary to democratically formulate complete and practical security rules and systems, such as holding regular security inspections, stipulating that the director of the Mining Bureau and the mine manager shall go down to the mine on a regular basis to inspect the security matters of the entire mine, discover problems in time and improve them in time; mine engineers and coal engineers shall set up underground offices and establish work logs; strengthen labor discipline, strictly abide by the specifications of tunnels, and set up security personnel in dangerous areas to be responsible for management and command, and implement pre-inspection, etc., which are effective and must be done. Also, because the security equipment of various mines in North China was extremely simple due to the destruction by Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang bandits during the war, we are often at a loss once a disaster occurs. We must thoroughly modify the ventilation system, eliminate air leakage, and ensure that it conforms to the scientific principles of ventilation to promptly eliminate methane and harmful gases; add security equipment and instruments to various mines, such as gas detectors, anemometers, and respirators, and establish underground security warehouses with readily available fire-fighting equipment and medicines.

　　加强保安设备保障矿井安全
  　华北煤业会议讨论矿井安全问题纪要
    本报记者  商恺
    华北各煤矿曾长期为日本帝国主义和国民党反动政府所统治经营。他们为了支援侵略战争，和反人民的内战，更为了追求高额的利润，从来是不注意工人的安全，和矿井的安全设备。华北全部解放后，各矿山回到人民之手，成了人民的企业。为了恢复和发展煤业生产，大力供应工业建设以充足的燃料，必须做好煤矿保安工作，保障生产在安全的条件下来进行。
    华北煤业会议检查了一九四九年九个月来的煤矿保安工作，发现在我们的煤业生产中，尚未肃清帝国主义和国民党反动统治时代所遗留下的坏影响，仍然不断的发生着各种大小事故和灾变，严重的危害着人民矿山恢复和建设的迅速进行。
    本年度各矿所发生的多次或大或小的灾变事故，应引起我们高度的警惕，它不但直接影响工友们的生命安全；同时也会使局部或全部的井下工程遭受破坏，使人民的财产蒙受巨大的损失。因此，煤矿保安工作，具有政治上、经济上的双重重要意义。华北煤业会议针对各矿灾变的基本原因，进行了深刻的检讨，并反复研究了防止各种灾变的有效对策：
    从各矿直接致灾致伤的原因看来，不外是设备简陋、通风不良、工人科学水平低、疏忽大意等；但同时也可看出，只要我们主观上努力，这些灾害大部分是可以避免的。各矿领导上对煤矿安全问题认识不够，检查和努力预防不足，是发生灾变事故的基本原因之一。如焦作矿务局之黄土岗矿井，在一月份发生火灾后，领导上并未注意安全设备，此后事故灾变仍不时发生。为了对工人负责，对国家财产负责，各级领导必须首先在思想上认识这个问题的严重性，反对官僚主义和麻痹思想，将煤矿安全问题提到原则的高度，下决心做好煤矿保安工作。
    发生事故的第二个原因是没有发动和组织全体员工，进行群众性的保安，把保安工作变成少数保安员的事情，一定不能办好。一般矿工科学知识水平低，有一些人更固执自己的经验，忽视煤矿安全，随便燃灯吸烟，井下灾变事故常常由此而起。例如峰峰通顺井是有沼气的矿井，该井工人王连喜认为自己可以凭感觉测验沼气情况，独自一人去试沼气，结果晕倒洞内，经积极施救，幸未致命。今后必须有计划有步骤地广泛进行保安教育，既反对麻痹，又要防止恐惧，提高员工对保安工作的正确认识，把大家组织起来，开展群众性的保安工作，这是最根本最有效的办法。焦作黄土岗小窑发生连续事故后，领导上注意起来，将保安问题交付全体员工讨论研究，大家想出办法，制订规约，分编小组，互相检查。实行以来大有成效，九月份的工伤已经近于消灭了。
    目前各矿的保安机构多不健全不科学，保安与采煤不能密切配合，保安制度规约亦未能认真彻底执行，使煤矿安全失去了重要的保证。会议认为：今后要改变这种现象，除了发动群众组织矿井保安委员会外，必须建立由煤管局直到井下采煤面的一套保安建制。
    矿务局设立保安科，各矿井设立保安股，采煤区设立不脱离生产的保安组和保安员；各矿并应组织救护队或救护组，井下配备值班医务人员。还应民主制订完善实用的保安规则和制度，例如举行定期的保安大检查，规定矿务局长矿长按期下井检查全矿的保安事项，及时发现问题及时改进；矿厂工程师和煤师，要设立井下办公室，建立工作日志；加强劳动纪律，严格遵守坑道规格，危险地区设立保安员负责管理指挥，实行事先检查等等，都是有效的，必须作的。又因为华北各矿在战争期间，被日本帝国主义和国民党匪帮摧残破坏，保安设备极为简陋，一旦发生灾变，常常束手无策。我们必须彻底修改通风系统，消除跑风漏风现象，一定使其合乎科学的通风原理，及时排除沼气及有害气体；增添各矿保安器材和仪器，如气体检定器、测风仪、救生器等，并应建立井下保安仓库，常备消防器材和药品。
