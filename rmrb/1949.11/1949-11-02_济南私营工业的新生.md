Jinan Private Industry's Rebirth
By our Jinan Correspondent Chen Yongjin

I. A Tragic History

Looking back at the history of private enterprises in Jinan, its development was very slow. By 1928, there were only about 50 spinning, weaving, flour, match, printing, brick, tile, and machine factories. Imperialist and bureaucratic capitalist also accounted for a large proportion of these factories. From the Northern Expedition to the Anti-Japanese War, the environment was relatively stable, and transportation conditions were better, so it once saw some development. However, with the entire country under the threat of imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang rule, the substantial development of private industry was fundamentally impossible.

After the Japanese plundered, the Kuomintang followed with a takeover, and Jinan's private enterprises fell into decline and neglect. Larger factories in Jinan that used machine production, such as Chengda, Renfeng, and Chengtong textile mills, Fengnian, Chengji, Baofeng, and Chengfeng flour mills, and Hengtai match factory, were successively placed under "military control" after the Japanese occupied Jinan. Some were forcibly bought or "cooperated" with, and then a rationing system was implemented, with both raw materials and finished products being controlled. After the Kuomintang "took over," they were suffocated by soaring prices, terror, conscription, and forced labor. Manager Meng of the Wende Iron Factory in the old Dongmen of Jinan calculated that from March to August of 1948, they had to send an average of six laborers every day to dig ditches outside the city. From 1947 until the liberation in 1948, they had to send an average of 10 to 20 volunteer police officers every day. During this period, they had to sell three mother machines to maintain their livelihood. Larger factories in the suburbs were all stationed with Kuomintang bandit troops. The Yuxing Chemical Pigment Factory, with a 30-year history located at the Wuliu Lock on the Xiaoqing River in the northern suburbs, had 36 large and small bunkers built around it by Kuomintang bandit troops. Under these circumstances, the Yuxing Pigment Factory had to move to the business district's storefront to work, producing only 200-300 jin per day. Factories in the suburbs were arbitrarily damaged, and the work of factories large and small was limited by the power plant, which only supplied electricity three times a week. All 23 brick, tile, and sawmill businesses were shut down. Even more tragic was that on the eve of liberation, the large-scale Fengnian and Chengji flour mills were burned down by the Kuomintang. Of the 131 machines in the city's seven flour mills, only 48 remained. From this, we can see how desolate private industry was from the "July 7th Incident" until Jinan was liberated. Jinan is liberated, and the sad history of private enterprises is gone forever.

II. A Turning Point in the Thinking of the Industrial Sector

After Jinan was liberated, the industrial sector looked at the Communist Party's implementation of its industrial and commercial policies with excitement and fear. They highly praised the People's Liberation Army's Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention, but questioned the economic policies of "developing production, prospering the economy, taking into account both public and private interests, and benefiting both labor and capital." They felt troubled, even afraid, of the organization of trade unions and the establishment of workers' unions because they were influenced by the Kuomintang's reactionary propaganda. Some fled from Jinan to other cities, some dispersed their funds, and some dismissed old workers on the pretext of poor business, fearing wage increases. They believed, "Our production has been bad for so many years, wouldn't improving workers' lives lead to losses?" Regarding workers' unions, they thought, "Once they are organized, they won't be obedient, and what's the point of benefiting both labor and capital?"

On the other hand, after liberation, some factories experienced workers making excessive demands for wages. At this time, the government and trade unions, based on the principle of benefiting both labor and capital, extensively educated workers to proceed from the long-term interests of the working class, strive to develop production, improve technology, cherish property, and save raw materials, and improve their lives through the development of production. The vast majority of workers made concessions in accordance with the government's and trade unions' instructions. Labor-capital disputes were constantly resolved. For those who had particular difficulties in starting work, the People's Government provided loans to help, such as the Wende Iron Factory, which received a loan of 30 million yuan from the government to start work. After much policy and practical education, and especially after the end of the Huaihai Campaign, the southward advance of the army, and the successive liberation of major cities, some people in Jinan's industrial sector gradually shed their ideological baggage. The Trade Corporation played a role in promoting finished products and supplying raw materials to the industrial sector. Many raw materials for the eleven match factories were exchanged from the Trade Corporation. The People's Bank provided loans to support more than 240 private industrial households. However, the complete turning point in the thinking of the industrial sector came after a series of meetings and the facts of labor-capital benefits being presented, especially the municipal government's conference of representatives from all walks of life and the visit to the Dahua Pottery Company in Beijing and Tianjin, Comrade Liu Shaoqi's speech to the industrial sectors in Tianjin and Beijing, and Comrade Li Lisan's article "Developing Production and Benefiting Both Labor and Capital."

III. Rebirth

Under the correct implementation of the policy of benefiting both labor and capital, and with the hard work of employees, Jinan's private industry has clearly achieved great development and shown its vigorous new vitality.

All of Jinan's 458 larger industries (including 306 with powered machinery and 152 with manual machinery) had resumed work by April. According to current surveys, factories in all industries have seen great development. Looking only at the match, machinery, oil pressing, pigment, and pig iron industries, 73 new businesses have been added. Fifteen sawmill and pole-making businesses and thirteen brick and tile businesses, which had been shut down for many years before liberation, have all reopened. Looking at the match industry registered with the Industry and Commerce Bureau, there were only five match businesses before 1938. By June of this year, the statistics showed twelve. By the end of August, Yuhua, Zhenxing, Zhenguang, and eight other companies had registered and recently started work. Now there are 21 match industries. The pigment industry has increased from 18 to 35. Many of these industrial businesses have come from industries far from the needs of the people, such as silk and satin shops.

The overall situation of private industry is like this. If you step into large or small private factories to observe, you can find more facts from the development of production and the new labor attitude of liberated workers. In the Tianqing and Guo Tianxiang machine factories on Erda Malu in the business district, during the Japanese occupation and the Kuomintang reactionaries' rule, they had no raw materials, no sales channels, and no electricity, and could only produce three cotton gins or noodle machines per month. As for whether they could be sold, they didn't even know. Now they produce 15 units per month and still cannot meet the sales demand. The labor-capital relationship in the Yuhua Match Factory can help you understand the general situation. This is also a relatively normal example in Jinan's private factories. There is a literacy school, a cooperative, and a designated hospital here. Workers' salaries have been appropriately increased. Workers conscientiously save raw materials, actively improve technology, and increase production. In the past, one medicine (more than eight jin) dipped two boxes, now it can dip three boxes. Manager Gao Lianpei's plan has been implemented: he added a machine, built eleven houses, added eight workers, and increased production from ten boxes to fifteen boxes per day. He almost completely purchases raw materials from the Trade Corporation and then hands over the finished products to the Trade Corporation for sale. Going to Jinan's largest Chengtong Textile Mill and Yuxing Pigment Factory, Chengtong Textile Mill's three-year plan for the first year (this year) to add ten steel wire machines, fifteen fine spinning machines, and thirty cloth machines has been largely realized. Yuxing Pigment Factory has increased from 300 jin per day before liberation to 3,200 jin, and they are working hard for 6,000 jin per day.

The reason why Jinan's private industry can develop so much is precisely as Comrade Li Lisan pointed out, "It must be explained from the victory of the entire working class and the Chinese people in the political struggle in China, and from the victory of the economic policy of developing production and benefiting both labor and capital as instructed by Chairman Mao."

Jinan's private industry still has its difficulties now, such as the problem of raw material supply, and the problem of more extensive sales channels. Chairman Kang Sheng personally presided over a joint meeting of district administrative commissioners, commissioners, mayors, and the Jinan industrial sector to study how to solve these problems, which greatly encouraged the Jinan industrial sector. At this meeting alone, everyone exchanged information on the sources of raw materials and sales channels, which solved many problems for the industrial sector.

　　济南私营工业的新生
    本报驻济南记者  陈勇进
    一、悲惨的历史
    翻开济南市私营企业过去的历史来看，它的发展是很慢的。至一九二八年仅有纺纱、织布、面粉、火柴、印刷、砖瓦、机器工业五十来家，这些工厂中帝国主义及官僚政客的资本又占了很大的比重。从北伐战争以后到抗日战争以前环境比较稳定，交通条件较好，因而曾一度得到了一些发展，可是整个的国家在帝国主义及蒋介石国民党的统治威协下，私营工业的长足的发展是根本不可能的。
    日寇掠夺之余，国民党接着又来了个劫收，济南的私营企业就陷入了凋蔽和冷落。济南较大的使用机器生产的工厂如成大、仁丰、成通纱厂，丰年、成记、宝丰、成丰面粉厂及恒太火柴厂，日本侵占济南后，先后便加以“军管”，有的被强迫收买或“合作”以后，又实行配给制度，原料成品均被控制。国民党“接管”后，又被物价的暴涨、恐怖、征兵出夫压得喘不过气来。济南老东门里的文德铁工厂孟经理计算着从四八年的三月到八月平均是每天出夫六个到城外挖沟，从四七年直到四八年的解放为止平均每天出十名到二十名义务警察，这其间他们不得不卖掉三部母机来维持生活。郊外大一点的工厂里都驻有国民党匪军。城北郊小清河五柳闸有三十年历史的裕兴化学颜料厂，国民党匪军在这周围修了三十六个大小堡垒，在这种情况下，裕兴颜料厂不得不搬到商埠的门市部里来作工，每日只能出二三百斤。郊外的工厂在任意的遭受着损害，大小工厂的工作都为发电所限制着，每个礼拜只能发三次电，二十三家砖瓦业锯木业全部停工了，更惨苦的是在解放前夜，规模宏大的丰年、成记面粉厂被国民党烧毁了，全市七家面粉厂一三一部机器只剩了四十八部。从这里我们可看出“七七”到济南未被解放之前，私营工业是处在如何凋蔽的状况中。济南解放了，私营企业的悲哀历史是一去不复返了。
    二、产业界思想的转折
    济南解放了，产业界是带着兴奋而又恐惧的心情来看共产党对工商政策的执行。对解放军三大纪律八项注意是高度的赞扬，对“发展生产、繁荣经济、公私兼顾、劳资两利”的经济政策就打上了问号。对工会的组织工人成立工会则感到麻烦，甚至害怕，这是因为受了国民党的反动宣传影响。有的从济南跑到另一个城市里去，有的分散资金，有的借营业不好解雇老工人，怕增资，他们认为“我们的生产这样多年来就不好，再改善工人生活不得赔本吗？”对工人组织的工会认为“组织起来了就不服管了，反正是劳资一利？”
    另一方面，解放后，某些工厂里曾发生了工人对工资过高的要求。这时政府、工会本劳资两利原则，曾广泛的教育工人，从工人阶级长远利益出发，努力发展生产，提高技术，爱护财产，节约原料，从发展生产中来改善自己的生活。绝大多数工人是按照着政府及工会指示作了让步。劳资纠纷在不断的解决。对开工特别感到困难的，人民政府以贷款帮助，如文德铁工厂在开工时政府曾贷款三千万元使其开工。经过许多政策的与实例的教育，更加淮海战役结束，大军南进，各大城市相继解放，济南产业界某些人的思想包袱也逐渐丢掉了。贸易公司发起了给产业界推销成品供给原料的作用，十一家火柴厂的很多原料都是从贸易公司交换的，人民银行曾贷款扶助私营工业二四○余户。但产业界的思想的完全转折是经过一连串的会议及摆在面前的劳资两利的事实，特别是市政府各界代表会议及到京津对大华窑业公司的参观，刘少奇同志对天津北京产业界的讲话及李立三同志“发展生产劳资两利”的文章之后。
    三、新生
    济南市的私营工业，在劳资两利政策的正确执行下，在职工努力生产下，显然的得到了很大的发展，并显示出它蓬勃的新生气象。
    济市的四五八家较大工业（内有动力机器三○六家、人力机器一五二家），在四月间就全部复工了；据现在的调查，各行业工厂都有了很大的发展。只从火柴、机器、榨油、颜料、生铁五个行业来看，即增加了七十三家。解放前停工多年的十五户锯木制杆业，十三户砖瓦业均已重新开工。从工商局注册登记的火柴业上来看，火柴业一九三八年前只有五户，今年六月间统计是十二户，八月底即又有裕华、振兴、真光等八家登记并于最近开工，现在已有二十一家火柴工业。颜料业从十八家增至三十五家。这些工业家数的增加，很多是从绸缎庄等远离人民需要的行业转来的。
    从整个私营工业的概况来看是如此。如再踏进大的或小的私营工厂观察一下，从生产的发展和解放了的工人新的劳动态度上，那可以找出更多的事实。在商埠二大马路上天庆、郭天祥机器厂，他两家在日本鬼子侵占时代及国民党反动派统治时代，没有原料，没有销路，没有电力而每月只能出产三部轧花机，或切面机，至于是否能卖出去，他们自己还不知道，现在是每月产十五部，还不能适应销售。裕华火柴厂的劳资关系，可以帮助你了解一般的情况，这也是济南各私营工厂中，较正常的实例。这里有识字学校，有合作社，有委托医院，工人薪资适当增加了。工人认真的节约原料，积极改进技术提高生产，过去一个药（八斤多）蘸两箱，现在可蘸三箱。经理高连佩的计划付诸实现了，增加了一部机器，建设十一间房子，增添八个工人，从每天出十箱增到十五箱，他几乎完全从贸易公司购取原料再将成品交给贸易公司出售。到济南市最大的成通纱厂和裕兴颜料厂去看，成通纱厂的三年计划第一年（今年）增设钢丝机十部，精纺机十五部，布机三十部现已大部实现；裕兴颜料厂从解放前每天三○○斤增至三二○○斤，他们正为每天六千斤而努力。
    济南市的私营工业所以能如此发展，正是李立三同志指出的“要从整个工人阶级和中国人民在中国政治斗争中的胜利去求解释，从毛主席所指示的发展生产劳资两利的经济政策的胜利去求解释”。
    济南市私营工业现在还有他的困难，如原料供给问题，更加广大的销路问题等。康生主席曾亲自主持各区行署主任、专员、市长及济市产业界联席会来研究如何解决这些问题，这对济南产业界的鼓舞是很大的，只在这一个会议上大家交流了原料来源与销路的情况，就解决了不少产业界的问题。
