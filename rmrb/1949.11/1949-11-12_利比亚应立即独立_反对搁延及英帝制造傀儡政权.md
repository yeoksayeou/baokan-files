    Libya Should Immediately Be Independent
    Oppose Delay and the British Empire's Creation of a Puppet Regime
    The Soviet delegation reserves its proposal regarding the former Italian colonies. The Soviet proposal is based on respecting the right to self-determination of the people of these colonies. According to this principle, the Soviet delegation believes that the main thing in resolving the fate of the former Italian colonies is to resolve the issue of genuinely guaranteeing the independence of these countries. Therefore, regarding all three colonies: Libya, Eritrea, and Somaliland, the Soviet delegation proposes: Libya should be immediately independent, and Eritrea and Somaliland should be independent five years from now. During this period, Eritrea and Somaliland must be administered by the United Nations Trusteeship Council according to the trusteeship agreement. The Council shall appoint an Administrator with full administrative powers and be responsible to the Council. Under the Administrator, there shall be an advisory committee consisting of one representative each from the permanent members of the Security Council, Italy, and Abyssinia, as well as one representative of Europeans and two representatives of indigenous residents in Eritrea and Somaliland appointed by the above seven representatives.
    The majority group of the subcommittee holds a different opinion. They propose postponing Libya's independence for more than two years. The reason for the postponement is not for the benefit of Libya, but simply because some people want to maintain the great power of the British and French occupying authorities in various parts of Libya. The colonial countries that advocate postponing Libya's independence for more than two years want to cultivate a puppet government on Libyan soil and establish a political power, political institutions, and power organs that are in fact and in essence completely subject to Britain, France, and other colonial countries. This kind of behavior has already begun. On June 1 this year, the British government announced its intention to establish the first such government—the Cyrenaica government headed by the Senussi Emir. Britain, having been driven out of Palestine, wants to step into Libya and establish and strengthen its military bases in the Mediterranean region here. At the same time, Britain violated the Italian peace treaty and unilaterally handed over the Mellaha Air Base in Tripoli to the United States for use in January 1948. The Soviet Union has drawn the attention of Britain and other relevant authorities to the fact that this is a unilateral and illegal action that violates the terms of the Italian peace treaty. However, Britain still did so. This seems to be in return for the political, economic, and military assistance given to it by the United States, and it can also be said to be in exchange for the Marshall Plan's "aid" to it. After the United States established an air base there in early 1948, it became particularly concerned about the political, strategic, and colonial aspects there. Until recently, the interests of the three colonial countries, Britain, France, and Italy, in Libya were mutually conflicting, but now the United States has also openly joined the struggle to divide the Italian colonies.
    The Soviet representative said: If the Political Committee truly wants to resolve the Libya issue based on Libya's own interests rather than the political interests of the colonial countries that violate Libya's interests, then it must demand the withdrawal of foreign troops and the elimination of military bases in Libya within the shortest possible time, such as the three months proposed by the Soviet Union.
    However, the main idea behind the draft on Libya proposed by the majority group of the 17th Subcommittee is to dismember and divide Libya to suit the interests of the colonial countries.

### 利比亚应立即独立  反对搁延及英帝制造傀儡政权

    利比亚应立即独立
    反对搁延及英帝制造傀儡政权
    苏联代表团保留它关于前意属殖民地的提议。苏联的提议是以尊重这些殖民地的人民的自决权为基础的。按照这一原则，苏联代表团认为，解决前意大利殖民地命运中的主要东西，是解决真正保证这些国家的独立的问题。因此，关于所有三处殖民地：利比亚、厄立特里亚和索马利兰，苏联代表团建议：利比亚立即独立，厄立特里亚及索马利兰从现在起五年之后独立。在此期间，厄立特里亚及索马利兰均须按托管协定由联合国托管理事会管理，理事会得任命行政长官一人，赋有行政全权，并对理事会负责。在行政长官之下设咨询委员会，由安理会常任理事国、意大利和阿比西尼亚的代表各一人，以及由上述七代表所任命的厄立特里亚和索马利兰欧洲人代表一人和土著居民代表二人组成。
    小组委员会的多数集团持有不同的意见。他们提议把利比亚的独立搁延两年多时间。其所以要搁延，不是为了利比亚的利益，而只是因为有人想保持英法占领当局在利比亚各地的大权。赞成把利比亚的独立搁上两年多的建议的殖民国家，想在利比亚土地上扶植傀儡政府，建立一种在事实上和本质上完全受制于英、法和其他殖民国家的政权、政治机构和权力机关。这种行径已经开始。今年六月一日，英国政府宣布它打算建立第一个这样的政府——以森奴西酋长为首的昔兰尼加政府。英国被逐出了巴勒斯坦，乃想插足利比亚，在这里建立和加强它在地中海区的军事基地。同时，英国还违反对意和约，于一九四八年一月擅自把的黎波里的梅拉空军基地交予美国使用。苏联曾经提起英国及其他有关当局注意，这是破坏对意和约条款的片面非法行动。但是，英国仍然这样做了。这看来是为了报偿美国所给它的政治、经济和军事的帮助，并且还可以说是为了换取马歇尔计划对它的“援助”。美国于一九四八年初在那里建立了空军基地之后，对那里的政治、战略和殖民方面，就特别关心起来。直到最近，英、法、意三个殖民国家的利益在利比利亚是互相倾轧的，而现在，美国也公开加入了瓜分意大利殖民地的斗争。
    苏联代表说：政治委员会若真想根据利比利亚自身的利益而不是根据违背利比利亚利益的殖民国家的政治利益来解决利比利亚问题，则它必须要求在最短期内，如苏联所提议的三个月内，撤退外国军队和消除利比利亚境内的军事基地。
    但是，第十七小组委员会多数集团所提关于利比利亚的草案背后的主要观念，则是肢解和瓜分利比利亚，以符殖民国家的利益。
