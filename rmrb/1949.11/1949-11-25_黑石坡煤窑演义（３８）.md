　　Romance of the Black Rock Slope Coal Mine (38)
　　Kang Tuo
　　At this time, Old Yin moved over to where Shuan Cheng and Zhu Da San were. Seeing them both there, he asked them, "Do you guys manage the big kiln in our village?" Old Yin said, "What?" Da San turned his face away and said, "I'm talking about the big kiln that was confiscated from the traitor Zhang Yubao of Chunqi! Let me tell you, that's a good kiln! Originally, I opened half of it for Zhang Xilu of our village. Later, the traitor, special agent, local bully, and rich man Zhang Jubao destroyed the kiln and ruined Zhang Xilu's family. He even seized the kiln! After seizing it, he kept destroying it! He destroyed it like that for over ten years. After Chunqi was liberated, the gang of traitors led by Zhang Niubao still benefited from it. The kiln was confiscated in a muddle, and Zhang Xilu was criticized! Now it's still Niubao's gang who are working it, and no one else dares to interfere! There are no rules at all! Don't you, Hua Da, manage these things?" Old Yin patted Da San's shoulder and said, "Zhang Yuanlu, don't get so worked up! If the masses haven't done something, let's discuss it and then do it! Besides, even if someone was a traitor for a couple of days, does that mean they can't even go down the kiln? What do you say?" Da San turned his face to the side again, not saying a word. Old Yin sat down, tilted his head back, and blinked his eyelids, thinking for a moment, then said, "The confiscation of the kiln probably wasn't very appropriate, and criticizing Zhang Xilu was also problematic. We're paying attention to how to open the kiln. Zhang Yuanlu, your opinions are all very good. But you can't say we don't have any rules! We're acting according to the Communist Party's policies! If the policies are flawed, the people can offer suggestions, and we can change them. Do you agree, Zhang Yuanlu?" Da San still didn't say anything. Old Yin continued, "We'll take care of everything you said! But you can't be impatient! Zhang Yuanlu, we have too much work to do right now, and besides, we don't understand many of the situations..." Da San became impatient. He felt that Old Yin was too long-winded and couldn't scratch where it itched. He interrupted, "Okay! You guys take your time!" After saying that, he turned his head and left.
　　Afterwards, Old Yin took some time, together with Shuan Cheng, to temporarily handle the affairs of the kiln. They held a meeting and decided that more people could go down to the west entrance of the big kiln. They also decided to pump out the water at the bottom of the pit while extracting coal. At the same time, they proposed that Da San be in charge of the management; but Da San stubbornly refused. Old Yin and the village cadres were also really too busy. After solving the affairs of the kiln, they didn't have time to inspect it. This guy Niubao took advantage of the opportunity to secretly make trouble behind their backs. He seized on Da San's stubbornness, saying things that made Da San feel unwanted as manager. Da San became even angrier and ignored everyone. He even went to Yangquan to take a look, wanting to find a job and get by. However, he couldn't find a ready-made job in Yangquan for the time being. When he returned to the village, he didn't even go out of his door, and swore that he would never care about the kiln again.

　　　　Thirty-Five　Struggle

　　However, the work led by Old Yin was quietly taking shape in Black Rock Slope Village, just like Da San used to open the big kiln, progressing step by step. Soon, the poor peasant group was made public. The people in the group then linked up with other poor people and those who were neither very poor nor rich, who earned enough to eat and wear, and formed a village-wide Workers' and Peasants' Turnaround Association. Later, according to Hua Da's instructions, because the workers and peasants here were inseparable, they did not establish a separate peasant association, but changed the Turnaround Association into a Workers' and Peasants' Association. Da San also joined. Little Foreign Devil and Lin Bao, who had been too scared to show their faces all this time, now also confessed that during the struggle in Chunqi, they didn't understand the situation, but when it came to distributing the fruits and doing work, they followed Yubao completely, and made some mistakes. But everyone said that they couldn't be blamed, and allowed them to join the Workers' and Peasants' Association, and even elected them as members of the committee. From then on, the two of them were full of energy and ran around busily. The chairman and vice-chairman of the Workers' and Peasants' Association were Shuan Cheng and Bian Xiao respectively, and Liu Goujia was also a member of the committee. After that, all the big and small affairs in the village were discussed upside down by the poor peasant group and the Workers' and Peasants' Association. The whole village was busy from early morning until late at night every day. Soon, everyone proposed that the struggle in Chunqi was a sham orchestrated by Qian Danao and the Yubao gang. Now it was time to have a proper struggle, to thoroughly expose the crimes of those feudal landlords, traitors, and local bullies, and let the poor people also have a good time venting their grievances of thousands of years! This opinion was immediately supported by the whole village, and the whole village immediately heated up and arrested Qian Danao and Yubao. They held group meetings and general meetings, and spent five or six days, day and night, arguing about their opinions and how to deal with them. Finally, they convened a struggle meeting.
　　This time was completely different from the last time in Chunqi. When the meeting was held, people went even before the temple bell rang. There were four or five hundred people in attendance. Those who wanted to offer opinions squeezed into a pile. People, no matter how big or small they had been oppressed, all scrambled to speak at the meeting to feel relieved. Many people cried while telling their grievances, and many people gnashed their teeth, trembling with anger and unable to speak! Listening to Bai Quan's family telling how Jubao bullied her and Qian Danao oppressed her, she cried until her eyes and nose were blurred; seeing Da San also getting into it, he suddenly rushed onto the stage and fiercely berated Qian Danao, his eyebrows raised and his eyes glaring like a tiger, so angry that he grabbed his torn top hat and his bald head was steaming... Qian Danao still stammered and didn't confess his mistakes very well. People found out from the documents of the puppet village government that he was a member of Yan Xishan's special agent organization "Revolutionary Comrades Association," so everyone decided to send him to the county government for processing. This time, Yubao kept kowtowing to the crowd and begging for mercy, and confessed a lot of crimes. However, everyone felt that he hadn't confessed thoroughly enough, so they let him go and told him to think hard and confess slowly. If he didn't confess well, they would send him to the county for processing. At the meeting, Niubao and his sister-in-law also voluntarily confessed some mistakes and asked to join the Workers' and Peasants' Association, but the whole audience shouted in unison that they didn't agree. In addition, some other people were struggled against at the meeting. It went on all day, but it wasn't finished because it was getting dark, so the meeting was temporarily adjourned.
　　The next day, the meeting continued. People gave some opinions to several other landlords and then discussed Xilu's matter. This matter had been investigated and discussed in various groups in advance, and Old Yin had also studied it with the leaders of Hua Da. Everyone felt that he had not eaten rent grain, and had only farmed one mu of land for Da San, which didn't count for much. As for lending money, when he was doing business, he had indeed helped people out of emergencies with ten or eight yuan, but the interest was not high, and he didn't specialize in lending money, and he was old, so it couldn't be counted. As for hiring long-term workers, it was only ten years ago that Bian Xiao had worked for him as a half-rate long-term worker for two or three years. In recent years, he hadn't even hired short-term workers, so it wasn't enough to meet the criteria. When it came to doing business and running a kiln, that wasn't feudal exploitation. According to his situation, he could only be considered a middle peasant. Moreover, yesterday Yubao also confessed that the struggle against him in Chunqi was orchestrated by Qian Danao, so the meeting announced: It was wrong to struggle against Xilu, Xilu is okay, and everyone agreed to let him join the Workers' and Peasants' Association. The bag of grain, dozen or so pieces of clothing, and eight mu of land that were taken from him during the Chunqi struggle would be returned immediately. The grain and clothing had already been distributed, and they would find a way to compensate him later. As for the kiln, because the situation hadn't been clarified too much and people's opinions were not consistent, it wasn't resolved immediately. After this was over, Xilu himself asked to speak, and everyone shouted in unison: "Speak!" So he went to the stage on the opera platform.
　　Since he was struggled against in Chunqi, he hadn't gone out of the gate much. People didn't talk to him when they saw him, and he avoided people when he saw them. But for the past six months, he had been carrying a heart problem that was getting heavier day by day. His family hadn't had much savings in recent years, and this year's harvest wasn't good either, so eating and drinking were difficult: therefore, he had lost a lot of weight, and his beard was also gray. Now, his matter was clarified, and he was so happy that he couldn't stand firmly on the stage, didn't know where to put his hands, and his mouth trembled so much that he couldn't speak clearly. After a long time, he finally took out a piece of paper from his pocket and told everyone that it was a letter that his second son had just brought back two days ago. His second son had been captured by our side when he was a stubborn soldier, and now he had joined the People's Liberation Army, and everything was fine. At this time, Shuan Cheng stood at the edge of the stage and interjected to tell everyone: "Our Uncle Xilu is a glorious military family." Xilu was so happy that he couldn't close his mouth. Later, some people at the bottom of the stage became impatient and told him to say what he had to say quickly. He then stammered for a while: "I'm sorry! I'm sorry!" Slowly calming down, he explained the origin of the matter, how Jubao relied on the power of the Japanese devils and the traitor Yan Xishan to destroy his kiln, seize his kiln, ruin his family, and arrest his son. He also said that he also had faults, that he had exploited people more or less those years, and that there were bound to be problems in how he treated people. Finally, he said: "Now this is good! This is good! From now on, we must be of one heart with everyone and honestly follow the right path. As for that bit of grain and clothing from the Chunqi incident; that's a small matter! Anyway, I have enough land to eat and wear, and I'm stronger than everyone else anyway, so please don't return it! As for the kiln, there's no need to discuss it! I don't want it! If I wanted it, I wouldn't have the capital or the ability to fix it up, so I'd have to abandon it anyway! Everyone can deal with it as they see fit. If Comrade Hua Da can lead everyone to find a way to make the kiln successful, then our whole village will be blessed, and I, Zhang Xilu, will also benefit! Isn't that the right thing to do? Good, this is the honest truth from the bottom of my heart. Everyone can point out any mistakes if there are any."

　　黑石坡煤窑演义（３８）
　　康濯
    这时老尹搬过了拴成家祝大三一去，见他二人都在，就冲着他们问道：“咱村这大窑你们也管不？”老尹道：“什么？”大三撇过脸去说：“我说的是春起汉奸张玉宝给没收的大窑！告你们说，那可是个好窑！那原本是我给咱村张喜禄开了一半，后底汉奸特务恶霸老财张聚宝把窑给毁了，把张喜禄的家当也闹了个差不多，连窑他也给霸占了！霸占了吧可他又还一个劲毁这窑！这么直毁了十来年，春起解放了，可还让汉奸张牛宝那伙子给吃灰食，又稀里糊涂没收了窑，把张喜禄给斗了一顿！这会也还是牛宝那伙子在动弹，别人不敢插手！什么也没个规章！你华大就不管这些？”老尹拍着大三肩膀道：“张远禄你别这么动火嘛！大伙没干的，咱们讨论着也下去干嘛！再说当过两天汉奸的，莫非就连下窑动弹也不让？你说呢？”大三脸又撇过一边，一声不啃。老尹坐下来，仰着脖子扑展着眼皮想了想，又说：“没收窑的事怕就是不怎么合适，斗争张喜禄也有毛病，怎么开窑嘛，咱们也正在注意；张远禄你的意见都很好。不过你不能说咱们什么也没规章！咱们是按共产党的政策办事的！如若是政策有毛病，老百姓可以提意见，咱们可以改。你说对么张远禄？”大三还是不言声，老尹又说：“你说的咱们都要办！可你不能性急！张远禄，这会咱们工作太多，再说好多情况又不了解……”大三不耐烦了，他觉得老尹这人太噜嗦，摸不着他心里头的痒处，就插嘴道：“行！你们慢慢办吧！”说完，扭头走了。
    过后，老尹抽了个功夫，和拴成一道把窑上的事临时办了办，开会决定了大窑的西口窑可以多下去一些人，并决定一边出灰，一边把那坑底下的存水打干，同时提议让大三下去经管；但大三却要蹩扭不去。老尹和村干部们也实在太忙，把窑上的事解决以后，没功夫去检查，牛宝这家伙就钻空子背后暗里捣乱，抓住大三的蹩扭劲，说些不稀罕大三经管的话，大三更气得谁也不搭理，并私下里去阳泉看了看，想找个干的混下去算了；不过，阳泉一时也找不出个现成营生，他回到村来，就门子也不出，并发誓再也不管球窑上的事了。
    　　　　三十五　斗争
    不过老尹领导的工作，却在黑石坡村不声不响地支架起来，正象大三过去开大窑一样，一步步越走越象样。不久贫农组公开了，组里人们又串连别的穷人和那些也不很穷也不财主、打下够吃挣下够穿的中农，成立了全村工人农民翻身会，后来又根据华大指示：因为这里工人农民分不开，不单独成立农会，就把翻身会改成了工农会，大三也串连进去了；小洋鬼和林宝，这些时一直是着怕得不敢露面的，这会也坦白了春起闹斗争他们不摸底，可分果实、办工作尽跟玉宝跑，也作了些错，但大伙说那不能怪他们，并让他二人也入了工农会，还选上他俩当了委员，他俩自此就整天兴头足足地跑搭着忙来忙去；工农会是拴成和扁小的正副主任，柳沟家也是委员。以后村里大小事就都是贫农组和工农会翻上倒下地讨论，一村子整日家从大早直忙到大半宿。不久，大伙提出：春起的斗争是乾大脑和玉宝们串通一气闹的假，现在还该着正经闹闹，把那些封建老财汉奸恶霸的罪恶澈底往出掏一掏，让穷人也痛痛快快诉诉苦出出千万年的冤气！这个意见立时浑村拥护，浑村也立时烘火热闹地把乾大脑和玉宝扣了起来，并开小组会和大会，没明没夜地咯嚷了五六天对他们的意见和处理办法，最后就召开了斗争大会。
    这回跟春起那回整个地不同。开会的时候，人们不等庙上敲钟，就都去了，到会有四五百号人；提意见的挤成一堆，人们不论受过大小制的都争着要到大会上说说才算甘心出气；多少人一边诉苦一边啼哭，多少人咬着牙气得浑身哆嗦说不出话！听白泉家诉说聚宝欺负她和乾大脑压迫她，啼哭得眼睛鼻子一抹平；看大三也上了劲，他忽然抢上台去，狠狠地吹唬乾大脑，真是虎眉豹眼地，气得他抓下破礼帽，秃头皮光冒热气……乾大脑这回却还是支支扭扭不很好坦白错误，人们又从顽伪村公所的文件里查出来他是阎锡山的特务组织“革命同志会”会员，大伙就决定送他县政府处理。玉宝这回倒一个劲给大伙叩头求饶，并坦白了很多罪恶，大家却觉着他还坦白得不彻底，就放了他叫他再好好思想慢慢坦白，不坦白好便要送他县里去处理。会上牛宝和他嫂也自动要求坦白了一些错误，并要求入工农会，可全场一音喊着不答应。此外，会上还斗争了一些别人，直闹了一整天，还没闹完，因为天黑了，就暂时休会。
    第二天，继续开会，人们给别的几个地主提了些意见，就讨论喜禄的事。这事情事先经过调查和各小组的讨论，老尹又跟华大领导上研究过，大家都觉得他并没吃过租米，只给大三种过一亩地，那算不了什么；放帐嘛，他作买卖的时候，倒也十块八块救过人家的急，但利钱不大，也不是专一放帐，而且年长了，也不能算；雇长工，也只是十来年前扁小给他作过二三年半块长工，这些年连短工也概没雇过，更不够条件；说到作买卖滚窑，那不是封建剥削；根据他的情况，只能算个中农。再说，昨天玉宝也坦白了春起斗争他是乾大脑闹的鬼，因此会上就宣布：斗喜禄斗错了，喜禄没事，大家并同意了让他参加工农会；春起闹了他一口袋粮食、十来件衣裳和八亩地，地当下退还，粮食衣裳早分了，以后再想法补给他；窑嘛，却因为情况没闹得太清楚，人们意见也不一致，就没当下解决。这么完了以后，喜禄自己要求说话，人们一音喊着：“说吧！”他就上戏楼主席台上去了。
    他自从春起被斗争以后，就没怎么出过大门，人们见了他也不说话，他见了人家也是躲躲闪闪地避开去，但他这半年却老是卡着块心病，一天比一天重；这些年他家里又没什么底子，今年年景也不强，吃喝都有困难：因此，他瘦多了，胡子也灰白了。现在，他的事情闹清楚了，直欢喜得他上了台腿脚也立不住，手也没处搁，嘴哆嗦得话也说不清，闹了半天，他才从兜里掏出一张什么纸，告给大家，说那是他二小前两天才捎来的信，他二小当顽固军给咱们俘虏了，如今参加了解放军，一切都挺好挺好。这时拴成站到台口来，插了句嘴告给大家道：“咱喜禄叔可是个光荣军属啦。”乐得喜禄呵呵哈哈地合不拢嘴。后来台底有人不耐烦了，叫他有什么就快说，他这才噜嗦了一阵：“对不起！对不起！”慢慢安下心来，起根缘由地说了说聚宝怎么仗着日本洋鬼和汉奸阎锡山的势力，毁了他的窑，霸了他的窑，闹了他的家当，抓了他的小子；他并说他也有错误，那些年多多少少也剥削过人，待人处事的总也短不了有病；最后说：“如今这可是好啦！这可是好啦！往后咱可一定得跟大伙抱一条心，老老实实走正道。要说春起那点子粮食衣裳嘛；那可是淡事情！反正我那点地够吃够穿，怎么我也比大伙强，可千万别退啦！窑嘛，也甭讨论啦！我不要了！要了吧反正我也没垫本没能耐拾掇它，还不也得撂了！大伙看着怎么对付就怎么对付，华大同志要能领导咱大伙想法把窑闹成，那就是咱浑村有福，我张喜禄也就沾光啦！大伙说不是这个理么？好，这是咱五脏六腑里头掏出来的实心话，大伙看着要是有错嘛就给咱提提。”
