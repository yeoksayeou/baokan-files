A Visit to the Disaster Area
	Bai Shan
	More than fifty cadres and comrades from our regiment organized a rural visiting team to visit the disaster-stricken areas around Huangcun in Daxing County, Hebei Province.

	Around 2:00 PM on October 20th, we arrived at Huangcun. The first thing we saw was a clapper rhyme written on the wall in chalk by comrades from the rural work team:

		Fellow villagers, listen to me,
		Let's find ways to get food and clothing.
		Pick elm leaves, burn charcoal,
		Gather grass seeds, boil saltpeter,
		Think of ways to help ourselves and don't be annoyed.
		In the past, no one cared if we had nothing to eat,
		This year the government is finding ways to help,
		We must listen to the government,
		And work hard to be thrifty and boost production.

	"Pick elm leaves," "gather grass seeds"—how can that be considered finding food and clothing? We all had our doubts. But after talking to an old man picking coal cinders under the stove, we realized that this clapper rhyme was a true depiction of the lives of the farmers in the area around Yihezhuang, Sanhezhuang, and Sanyizhuang, three miles southwest of Huangcun. So, after dinner, we decided to leave Huangcun and go to Yihezhuang.

	By the time we arrived in Yihezhuang, it was already late, and we couldn't conduct a formal visit. We could only chat casually with the homeowner. In our conversation with the homeowner, the comrades learned the general situation of the village: Yihezhuang has a total of forty-two households, of which five are landlords and rich peasants. They occupy more than 370 mu of the village's 964 mu of land. The soil in Yihezhuang is heavily alkaline, and the terrain is very low-lying, so water from all directions flows here. This year, two hailstorms and one rainstorm destroyed all the crops. Not to mention hiring poor peasants, even middle peasants can hardly eat proper grain.

	Early the next morning, we first went to the village chief's house to hear his report on the disaster situation. He showed us his grain: a pile of finger-thick sweet potatoes—the entire sweet potato harvest for the year—and a jar of sorghum bran bought from the city.

	The comrades sat in the courtyard, listening to the village chief recount the village's suffering: last year's harvest was poor, only reaching 40% of normal, and the evil Kuomintang bandits cruelly carried out "armed requisition."

	This year, Yihezhuang was liberated, but unfortunately, it encountered a natural disaster. In May, there were two hailstorms, followed by more than sixty days of continuous rain, which not only wiped out the harvest, but also left many areas unable to be plowed and sown.

	The farmers had no choice but to eat elm leaves, wild vegetables, grass seeds, and sweet potato leaves to get through the famine. Cheap northeastern sorghum bran was also bought from the city, but the children couldn't pass it, and cried from being bloated.

	If there was no grain, it would be good to find some temporary solutions, but the reality was very difficult. The landlords were leaving their land barren and not hiring short-term laborers, and the situation in other villages was similar.

	Now the People's Government is actively trying to solve the people's hardships. Party and government organs and the army are practicing thrift to provide relief to the disaster victims. Yihezhuang has already received 340 jin of millet. The government is also providing relief through "work-for-relief" methods (such as sifting stones for the railway, etc.). On the one hand, it is lending wheat seeds and calling for intensified production to overcome difficulties. However, the disaster area is so vast, and the War of Liberation is still going on. Relief alone cannot solve the problem. The main thing is to rely on leadership and organization to help the disaster victims help themselves. The people of Yihezhuang also understand this principle very well.

	Next came individual visits. More than fifty comrades went to visit more than twenty families who were eating elm leaves and sorghum bran. The farmers' lives deeply touched the hearts of the comrades, who comforted them with utmost sincerity, encouraging them to work hard to help themselves under the leadership of the government. We wrapped a little of these foods separately and took them back to educate the soldiers in our company.

	In the evening, the sound of farmers hitting broken plows and the sound of the army's bugles for assembly mingled together. The comrades sang songs, and the farmers responded with enthusiastic applause and cheers. Village cadres, teachers, farmer representatives, and comrades' representatives spoke in turn, expressing their friendship and gratitude from the bottom of their hearts. When the village chief announced to everyone that the comrades had decided to donate a meal's worth of food they had saved to the village to express their goodwill, some farmers were so moved that they sobbed. Everyone had a deeper understanding of the true meaning of "the army and the people are one family, as close as flesh and blood."

	After returning from the disaster visit, we also launched a disaster reporting and evaluation.

	During the disaster visit, the comrades proceeded individually in twos and threes. Now, gathered together, they told everyone what they had seen and heard.

	The comrades reported to everyone with deep sorrow, combined with their own past suffering, and criticized some of the erroneous thoughts that currently existed in their minds. Hu Daxing, the company commander of the Third Company, said after recounting his past suffering:

	"I have been in the army for several years and have forgotten all the past hardships. Now that I see that we have won, I feel that I can eat, drink, and enjoy myself. I don't know that there are still many people starving and freezing! I must make a good self-criticism and eradicate these bad ideas of hedonism and corruption from the root."

	Why are the lives of the people of Yihezhuang, and even all the people of China, so difficult? The comrades began to dig into the root causes.

	Wu Yongsheng, the political instructor of the First Company, stood up and said, "If it weren't for the Kuomintang reactionaries' armed requisition, the farmers of Yihezhuang would not have had no food reserves, and they wouldn't have run out of food so quickly when they suffered a disaster this year. So I say, the people's suffering is caused by class enemies!"

	"Right! Class enemies!" Zhang Ming, the political instructor of the Third Company, stood up, waving his fist in the air: "But I want to add one more point. Chairman Mao has long told us that all problems must be approached from a class perspective. The Kuomintang reactionaries, the bureaucrats, and landlords, only cared about sucking the people's blood, and never cared about the economy or science. Therefore, the people's lives have always been very hard, and when they encounter disasters, of course, they suffer even more." Zhang Ming spoke with increasing force, continuing, "We are all farmers who have suffered. We joined the revolution to completely relieve the people of the suffering caused by the reactionary ruling class. Now, the revolutionary war has been won, but many of us have forgotten our roots, forgotten Chairman Mao's teaching: 'The victory of the revolutionary war is only the first step in a long march,' and everywhere we talk about eating, drinking, and enjoying ourselves, and we are unwilling to continue to endure hardship. In addition, some comrades are now pessimistic and disappointed, thinking that there is no way out to continue working. This is really strange! We used to be slaves, and now we have become the masters of the country. Isn't this a great success? Then, if we want to develop in the future, we must continue to work hard. Moreover, if we all leave the army, wouldn't the reactionaries and imperialists become rampant again, and wouldn't the country that we risked our lives to win be in danger again? We also know that the lives of the Chinese people are still very hard, aren't the people of Yihezhuang still eating elm leaves and grass seeds? To improve our lives, we must build. Without a strong national defense army to defend the country, how can China build in peace and stability? Chairman Mao called on us to 'always be a fighting force,' which is a very clear and correct principle. Therefore, seeing the suffering of the people of Yihezhuang, each of us should make a good self-examination, eradicate those ideas of 'hedonism and corruption' and 'going home to change careers,' maintain a consistent hard-working style, work loyally, and resolutely serve the people to the end!"

	The comrades were deeply moved. Applause and cheers drowned out everything.

　　访灾记
    白山
    团里的五十多个干部同志，组织了一个农村访问队，到河北省大兴县黄村一带受灾地区访问。
    十月二十日午后两点钟左右，我们到了黄村，首先看见农村工作组同志用粉笔写在墙上的快板：
    老乡们，听我言，
    咱们想法弄吃穿。
    撂榆叶，烧木炭，
    打草子，熬硝盐，
    想法自救别生烦。
    往年没吃没人管，
    今年政府想法办，
    咱们要听政府话，
    努力节约搞生产。
    “撂榆叶”，“打草子”，这怎么算是在弄吃穿呢？我们都这样怀疑。结果跟一个在灶下捡煤渣的老人一谈话，才知道这个快板确是黄村西南三里地义合庄、三合庄、三义庄一带农民生活情形的真实写照。于是我们决定饭后离开黄村，到义合庄去。
    到义合庄，时间已经很晚了，不能进行正式的访问，只能和房主人随便聊聊。在和房主人的谈话中，同志们知道了这个村子的大体情况：义合庄共有四十二户人家，其中有五户是地主富农，他们占有了全村九百六十四亩土地的三百七十多亩。义合庄的土质碱性既重，地势又极低下，四面八方的水都流汇在这里来，今年，两场雹子一场雨，庄稼全打毁了，别说雇贫农，就是中农也难得吃上正经粮食。
    第二天一早，我们先到村长家去，听他报告灾情。他指给我们看了他的粮食，那是一堆手指粗细的白薯——今年白薯的全部收成——和一缸从城里买来的高粱米糠。
    同志们坐在院场上，听村长诉说这村子的苦难：去年收成不好，仅及平常的四成，而万恶的国民党匪帮还残酷地进行了“武力征收”。
    今年，义合庄解放了，但不幸却碰到了天灾。五月间前后两次冰雹，接着又是六十几天的霪雨，不但收成没有，而且现在还有很多地方不能翻耕下种。
    农民们只好都吃榆树叶、野菜、草子、白薯叶渡灾荒。价值便宜的东北高粱米糠也从城里买了来，但是孩子们吃了它拉不下屎来，胀得直哭。
    没有粮食，能临时找点办法也好，然而事实却非常困难。地主荒着地也不雇短工了，旁的村子情形也差不多。
    现在人民政府正在积极设法解决人民的困苦。党政机关和部队都实行节约，赈济灾民，义合庄已领到了三百四十斤小米。政府又以“以工代赈”的方式（如上铁道筛石子等等）施行救济。一方面又贷给麦种，号召加紧生产，克服困难。但灾区这样广大，解放战争还在进行，单靠救济是不能解决问题的，而主要的要靠领导和组织灾民努力自救。义合庄的人民也都很了解这个道理。
    接着是个别访问，五十几个同志分别去访问二十几家吃树榆叶高粱米糠的家庭。农民们的生活深深地刺痛了同志们的心，他们都极其亲切地安慰着他们，鼓励他们在政府领导之下努力自救。我们把这些食物分别包一点，拿回去教育自己连队的战士。
    晚上，集合农民的破铧敲击声和集合部队的号声响成一片。同志们唱着歌子，农民们则报以热烈的鼓掌和欢呼。村里干部、教员、农民代表和同志们的代表相继发言，彼此倾吐着心底的友爱与感激。当村长向大家宣布同志们决定把节约一餐的食粮送给本村表示情意时，有些农民竟激动得啜泣起来。彼此更深刻地认识到“军民一家，骨肉相连”的真义。
    访灾回来之后，我们又展开了报灾和评灾。
    访灾的时候，同志们是三三两两地分别进行。现在，集合到一块儿来，把各人所看到听到的讲给大家听听。
    同志们都沉痛地向大家报告，结合着自己从前的痛苦，批判了自己目前所存在的一些错误思想。三连连长胡大兴在诉说了过去的痛苦后说：
    “我参军几年，把从前那些苦处全忘掉了。现在，看到已经胜利了，就觉得可以吃喝享受了，不知道还有许多老百姓挨饿受冻呢！我一定要好好检讨一番，把自己这些享乐腐化的坏思想从根拨去。”
    义合庄的老百姓，甚至所有中国的老百姓，生活为什么如此困苦呢？同志们便开始挖根了。
    一连指导员吴永生站起来说：“要不是国民党反动派的武力征收，义合庄的农民不会没有存粮，今年遭了灾荒，也不会马上就没吃的。所以我说，人民的痛苦是阶级敌人给的！”
    “对！阶级敌人！”三连指导员张明站起来，拳头在空中一挥：“不过我还要补充一点，毛主席早就告诉我们，一切问题要从阶级出发。国民党反动派的官僚地主，只顾吸人民的血，从来就不管什么经济和科学。因此，人民的生活一贯就很苦，遇到灾荒，那当然更遭殃了。”张明愈说愈有力，继续讲下去：“我们都是受过苦的农民。我们参加革命就是为了彻底解除反动统治阶级给人民的痛苦。现在，革命战争是胜利了，但我们很多人也忘了本，忘记了毛主席的教训：“革命战争的胜利只是万里长征走了第一步”，处处讲吃喝，闹享受，不愿再艰苦下去。另外有些同志目下又悲观失望，以为干下去没出路。这真是奇怪！我们从前是奴隶，现在成了国家的主人，这不是大大地出了头吗？那末，今后要发展，也得继续干下去。况且，假如我们大家都离开军队，反动派和帝国主义不是又会猖狂起来，我们拼死命挣来的江山，不是又危险了吗？我们又知道，目下中国人民的生活仍然很苦，义合庄的老百姓不是正在吃榆叶草子吗？要改善生活，就得建设，没有强大的国防军保卫国家，中国怎么能够安安稳稳地建设呢？毛主席号召我们“永远成为一个战斗队”，实在是非常明白非常正确的道理。所以，看到了义合庄人民生活的痛苦，我们每个人应该好好检讨一番，革除那些“享乐腐化”，“改行回家”的思想，保持一贯的艰苦作风，忠诚地干下去，坚决为人民服务到底！”
    同志们都深深感动了。掌声和欢呼声淹没了一切。
