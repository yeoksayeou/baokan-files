    Chinese Intellectuals and the October Revolution
    Huang Yaomian
    Some people think that the Soviet October Revolution Day is just the Soviet National Day, or that it is just the Communist Party's holiday. In fact, it is not. The October Revolution should be a day jointly celebrated by the working masses all over the world and all people who love peace and justice.

    Take Chinese intellectuals for example, they should be grateful for this October Revolution. Because the October Revolution not only gave the Chinese workers and peasants a new way out, but also gave Chinese intellectuals a new way out.

    Is there any basis for my words? Yes, there is.

    At the end of the Qing Dynasty, Chinese intellectuals, especially students studying in Europe, America, and Japan, were indignant at the oppression of imperialism and the corruption and incompetence of the feudal dynasty. They tried their best to advocate revolution, attempting to replace the feudal dynasty of the Qing Dynasty with the bourgeois democratic system of Europe and the United States. To be honest, Mr. Sun Yat-sen himself was precisely this type of intellectual. But what was the result? The Revolution of 1911 was superficially successful, but in fact the revolution failed. Political power fell into the hands of Yuan Shikai and the Northern Warlords. The hopes of the intellectuals were dashed. Intellectuals, as the oppressed, were not liberated.

    After the Republic of China, there were more new-style schools and more new intellectuals. This means that more young intellectuals were produced in the style of capitalism. They received training from capitalist society, they possessed the technology and knowledge needed by capitalist society, but the semi-feudal and semi-colonial Chinese society could not accommodate them. Students graduating from schools became unemployed as soon as they entered society. Under the dual oppression of imperialism and feudalism, the more intellectuals there were, the less way out there was. Apart from a few who became compradors and foreign slaves, willingly serving as running dogs of imperialism, and a few who sought personal gain and joined feudal bureaucratic groups, or formed cliques in some institutions in the name of classmates and fellow villagers, the general and broad intellectual stratum can be said to have fallen into pain and confusion.

    The October Revolution of 1917 did give great enlightenment to those intellectuals who were looking for a way out of their suffering. Now they began to understand that the Prussian road, the Japanese road, the American and French roads had all failed, and now there was only one Russian road, the road of the October Revolution.

    Thus, the doctrine of Marxism, the October Revolution, and the doctrine of Lenin were introduced by intellectuals.

    It is not surprising at all that as soon as this doctrine was introduced, it immediately gained widespread welcome among intellectuals. When the Communist Party was founded in 1921, many intellectuals voluntarily joined the party of the working class to fight for the interests of the proletariat and for the cause of Chinese national liberation. Because they deeply knew that only under the leadership of the working class could the Chinese revolution be victorious, and thus relieve the suffering of all Chinese people. After more than twenty years of arduous struggle, some of them betrayed the revolution, some of them sacrificed heroically, and some of them were tempered in the crucible and transformed under the education of the masses, becoming leaders and fighters of the people.

    Despite the reactionaries' frenzied massacres and persecutions, instigations and alienations, and despite some betrayals, wavering, and divisions, generally speaking, Chinese intellectuals still followed the revolution. The blood of many of the best intellectuals has already flowed together with the blood of the Chinese workers and peasants. This is something that Chinese intellectuals should be proud of.

    There were some highly educated intellectuals who had returned from capitalist countries who expressed doubts about the socialist system of the Soviet Union. They said that Russia was backward, and they said that the Soviet Union discriminated against intellectuals. But these rumors were shattered by the Soviet Union's first five-year plan and second five-year plan. The Soviet social system not only did not discriminate against intellectuals, but on the contrary, it gave scientists broad freedom of research and guaranteed them unlimited development prospects. They no longer had to work for the capitalists' money bags, they no longer had to look at the capitalists' faces, and they no longer had to worry that the fruits of their research would be stolen by others. The further socialism develops, the more knowledgeable and learned people are respected. When you see any of your own inventions and discoveries immediately enjoyed by the masses, and the masses look at you with admiring eyes, wouldn't you feel very excited?

    Yes, the socialist construction of the Soviet Union has once again given Chinese intellectuals great enlightenment: that China can also take the road of industrialization under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. Intellectuals have a more glorious future in a new democratic society and in socialism than in a capitalist society.

    So this also proves that it is completely correct for Chinese intellectuals to follow the working class and follow the path of the October Revolution.

    Now the reactionary, brutal, corrupt, and incompetent rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang has basically collapsed, and a new people's democratic regime has been established. Chinese intellectuals have also become a component of this new regime. Therefore, today should be the time for intellectuals to fully display their intelligence and talents to contribute to the country and the people. In Chinese history, intellectuals have never been raised to such a high position, and have never received such great respect from the masses of the people.

    Of course, the future nation-building cause still has great difficulties, and American imperialism is still ambitious, supporting the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, operating bases on the coastal islands of China, attempting to interfere in the Chinese revolution and instigate a third world war. It even wants to use "democratic individualism" and "liberalism" and other "good names" to lure Chinese intellectuals and find assistants among intellectuals. But we want to warn the American imperialists that all these conspiracies and tricks are futile. It does not understand the path of ideological development of Chinese intellectuals. We have always been following the path of the October Revolution, and now our partners are increasing.

    We are very honored that our knowledge and skills have the opportunity to be linked with the laborers today, working for the happiness of the greatest number of people in China. Chinese intellectuals are no longer lonely individuals, but members of a collective battle.

    中国知识分子与十月革命
    黄药眠
    有人以为苏联的十月革命节，只是苏联的国庆，或者以为这只是共产党的节。其实不然，十月革命应该是全世界劳苦大众以及所有爱好和平正义的人们所共同祝贺的日子。
    比方就以中国的知识分子来说，他就应该感谢这个十月革命。因为十月革命不仅给予了中国工农大众以一条新的出路，同时也给予了中国的知识分子以一条新的出路。
    我这句话有根据没有呢？是有根据的。
    当前清的末年，中国的知识分子，特别是留居欧美日本的留学生，他们愤于帝国主义的压迫和封建王朝的腐朽无能，曾极力鼓吹革命，企图以欧美的资产阶级的民主制度来代替满清的封建王朝。孙中山先生本人老实说，也正是这种知识分子型的人物。但是结果怎么样呢？辛亥革命表面上是成功了，但事实上革命是失败了。政权落在袁世凯手里，北洋军阀手里。知识分子的希望落空了。作为被压迫者的知识分子，并没有得到解放。
    民国以后，新式的学校是更多了，新的知识分子从而也更多了。这也就是说，依照资本主义的样式而制造出来的青年知识分子更多了。他们受的是资本主义社会的训练，他们拥有资本主义社会所需要的技术和智知识，可是半封建半殖民地的中国社会却不能容纳他们。学校里毕业的学生一到社会就变成了失业。在帝国主义和封建主义的双重压迫之下，知识分子越加多就越没有出路。除了一部分做了买办洋奴，自愿为帝国主义的走狗，和一部分钻营奔走加入封建官僚集团，或借同学同乡之名，结成帮派盘据一些机关的特殊知识分子以外，一般广泛的知识分子层可以说都源源陷入到痛苦和彷徨当中。
    一九一七年的十月革命，的确给予了那些在痛苦中找寻出路的知识分子们以很大的启示。现在他们开始了解，普鲁士的道路，日本的道路，美国和法国的道路都没有成功，现在只有一条俄国的道路，那就是十月革命的道路。
    于是马克思主义的学说，十月革命和列宁的学说，经由知识分子介绍了过来。
    一点也不奇怪，这个学说一被介绍过来，立即就在知识分子群中获得了广大的欢迎。当一九二一年共产党成立的时候，也就有不少的知识分子，自愿加入工人阶级的政党，为无产阶级的利益而奋斗，同时也为中国民族解放事业而奋斗。因为他们深深知道只有在工人阶级领导下，中国革命才能获得胜利，并从而解除全中国人民的痛苦。经过了二十多年的苦斗，其中有些人是叛离了革命，有些人是英勇牺牲，而有些人则是在千锤百炼在群众的教育之下脱胎换骨，成了人民的领袖和斗士。
    尽管反动派疯狂的屠杀和迫害，挑拨和离间，尽管这其间也有些叛变动摇和分化，可是一般的说来，中国的知识分子还是跟着革命走的。有许多最好的知识分子的血，已经是和中国工农群众的血流在一起了。这一点，中国知识分子是应该引以为光荣的。
    曾经有过一些从资本主义国家回来的高等知识分子们，他们对于苏联的社会主义制度表示怀疑。他们说俄国落后，他们说苏联歧视知识分子。可是这些谣言给苏联的第一个五年计划，第二个五年计划所打破了。苏联的社会制度，不仅不歧视知识分子，恰好相反，他给科学家们以广泛的研究的自由，并保证了他们有无限发展的前途。他们用不着为资本家的钱袋而工作了，他们再用不着看资本家的颜色了，他们再不愁自己研究得来的果实会被别人窃取去了。社会主义愈向前发展，有知识有学问的人就愈受到人尊敬。当你看见你自己的任何发明和发现立即为群众所享受，而群众们又以爱慕的眼睛注视着你的时候，难道你不会感到十分的兴奋吗？
    是的，苏联的社会主义的建设，又一次给予了中国的知识分子们以很大的启示：即中国也正可以在中国共产党领导之下走向产业化的道路。知识分子在新民主主义社会里面社会主义里面，比之在资本主义社会里面还要有更光辉的前途。
    所以这一点，也正证明了中国知识分子，跟着工人阶级、遵循着十月革命的道路来走是完全正确的。
    现在反动的残暴的腐败无能的蒋介石匪帮的统治，已经基本上垮台了，新的人民民主的政权也已经成立了，中国的知识分子也成为了这新政权的构成分子，因此今天也正应该是知识分子充分发挥其聪明才智，来贡献给国家和人民的时候了。在中国历史上，知识分子是从来没有被提到这样高的地位的，是从来也没有受到人民大众这样大的尊重的。
    当然未来的建国事业还有很大的艰难，而美帝国主义现在也还野心不死，支持着蒋介石匪帮，经营着中国沿海各岛的基地，企图干涉中国革命和挑动全世界的第三次大战。甚至还想用“民主个人主义”“自由主义”的这一类的“美名”来诱惑中国的知识分子，在知识分子当中找寻他的助手。但是我们要警告美帝国主义者们，这一切阴谋诡计都是徒劳的。他是太不懂得中国知识分子思想发展的道路了。我们一向都是向十月革命这条道路走的，现在我们的伙伴们是越来越多了。
    我们很荣幸，我们的知识和技能今天能够有机会和劳动者们联结在一起，为全中最大多数的人民的幸福而努力。中国的知识分子，再也不是孤单的个人，而是集体战斗中的一员了。
