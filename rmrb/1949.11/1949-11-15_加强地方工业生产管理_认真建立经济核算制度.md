Strengthen Local Industrial Production Management
    Conscientiously Establish Economic Accounting Systems
    Regarding the production management of local industries: The meeting believes that most provincial and municipal local industries have not yet established sound economic accounting systems. Cost accounting is just beginning, and waste is quite common. In the future, we should follow the principles of the Northeast People's Government's decision on economic accounting, learn new experiences in the management of state-owned enterprises, and implement the economic accounting system in a step-by-step manner. In this work, special attention should be paid to three points: (1) First, we should start with completing the inventory of assets, launching anti-waste campaigns, and creating new production records, thereby improving the quantity and quality of products and setting reasonable quotas. (2) Formulate cost and cost reduction plans. In 1950, labor efficiency should be generally increased by 10% to 30%, and costs should be reduced by 10% to 20%. (3) Strictly manage cash.
    Regarding the issue of accumulating funds to expand production: The meeting believes that local industries are not only needed now, but will also be needed in the future, because their main task is not to bear financial burdens, but to help state-owned enterprises restore construction and solve the needs of the people. Therefore, it must accumulate funds to expand production. However, according to today's situation, it cannot but bear a part of the financial tasks. The solution is to stipulate that the financial tasks of local industries should not exceed 50% of their net profits, and the remaining profits should be used for expanding production. Li Fuchun, Vice Chairman of the Northeast People's Government, Wang Heshou, Minister of Industry, and Lu Dong, Deputy Minister, attended the meeting and made important instructions and reports. Based on the spirit of this local industry meeting, various provinces and cities have put forward preliminary plans for local industrial production and construction in 1950. In the plan, many major products will be greatly increased compared with this year, such as coal, which will increase by 69%, matches will increase by 104%, and cloth will increase by 26%. Various localities also plan to carry out many important construction projects.

    加强地方工业生产管理
    认真建立经济核算制度
    关于地方工业的生产管理问题：会议认为目前绝大部分省市地方工业，还没有很好地建立经济核算制度。成本计算还刚刚开始，浪费现象相当普遍，今后应当按照东北人民政府有关经济核算决定的原则，学习国营企业管理的新经验，有步骤地推行经济核算制。在这一工作中，应特别注意三点：（一）首先应从完成清理资产、开展反浪费运动、创造生产新纪录作起，从而提高产品的数量质量，定出合理的定额。（二）制定成本和降低成本计划。在一九五○年应普遍提高劳动效能百分之十至三十，减低成本百分之十至二十。（三）严格地管理现金。
    关于积累资金扩大生产问题：会议认为地方工业不但现在需要，而且将来也需要，因为它的主要任务不是负担财政任务，而是帮助国营企业恢复建设和解决人民需要。所以它要积累资金，扩大生产。但按今天的情况说来，它又不能不负担一部分财政任务。其解决办法是：规定各地方工业的财政任务，不得超过其纯利润的百分之五十，余利作扩大生产之用。会上东北人民政府李富春副主席，工业部长王鹤寿和副部长吕东均曾出席并作重要指示与报告。各省市根据这次地方工业会议的精神，已提出一九五○年地方工业生产修建的初步计划。在计划中有很多主要产品将比今年大大增加，如煤将增加百分之六十九，火柴将增加百分之一百零四，布将增加百分之二十六。各地还计划进行许多重要修建。
