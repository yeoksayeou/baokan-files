　　Advance Towards the Victory of Communism
  　"Pravda" Editorial
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 7th] TASS, Moscow, 6th: Forward to the victory of communism under the banner of Lenin and the leadership of Stalin! This is the call made by "Pravda" in its editorial commemorating the 32nd anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution. The editorial states: The October Revolution ushered in a new era in human history. It signifies a fundamental transformation in human history from the old capitalist world to the new socialist world. The October Revolution is of epoch-making significance. It inaugurated the era of proletarian revolution in imperialist countries and the era of colonial revolutionary movements in oppressed countries around the world, allied with and under the leadership of the proletariat. It proved that fraternal alliance of workers and peasants of all countries is possible and appropriate on the principles of voluntariness and internationalism.
    The characteristic of the socialist revolution is that it gives to all nationalities not only freedom but also material welfare and the opportunity to obtain an abundant and cultured life. The success achieved in the post-war Five-Year Plan guarantees further improvement of the welfare of the Soviet people. The situation we see in capitalist countries is completely different. There, the situation of the working people is deteriorating, unemployment is increasing, and exploitation is intensifying. Imperialism, like a vampire, condemns millions of people to hunger and poverty.
    The Soviet Union points out to all advanced and progressive humanity a path to a bright future. On the eve of the 32nd anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution, the working people of our motherland, full of confidence in the victory of their just cause, raise even higher the great banner of the Party of Lenin and Stalin, the inspirer and organizer of all our victories. Under this invincible banner, under the brilliant leadership of Comrade Stalin, the Soviet people, in close ranks, are advancing towards the victory of communism.

　　向共产主义胜利前进
  　真理报社论
    【新华社北京七日电】塔斯社莫斯科六日讯：在列宁的旗帜下，在斯大林的领导下，向共产主义的胜利前进！这是真理报纪念伟大的十月社会主义革命三十二周年的社论所作的号召。社论写道：十月革命揭开了人类历史的新纪元。它意味着人类历史由旧的资本主义世界到新的社会主义世界的根本转变。十月革命具有划时代的意义。它揭开了帝国主义国家无产阶级革命的时代，揭开了和无产阶级联盟并在无产阶级的领导下进行的、全世界被压迫国家的殖民地革命运动的时代。它证明了在自愿与国际主义的原则上，各国的工人与农民兄弟般的联盟是可能与适当的。
    社会主义革命的特色在于：它给予各族人民的不仅是自由，并且有物质的福利和取得丰足与文化生活的机会。战后五年计划所获得的成功，保证了苏联人民福利的进一步增进。我们在资本主义国家所看到的情景，却全然不同。在那里，劳动人民的境遇每况愈下，失业不断增加，剥削日益加剧。帝国主义象吸血鬼一样，使千百万人民注定遭受饥饿和贫困。
    苏联向全体先进的进步人类指出了一条走向光明未来的道路。在伟大的十月社会主义革命三十二周年的前夜，我们祖国的劳动人民，对他们的正义事业的胜利，充满信心，更高地举起我们一切胜利的鼓舞者和组织者——列宁和斯大林党的伟大旗帜。在这一不可战胜的旗帜下，在斯大林同志光辉的领导下，苏维埃人民以紧密的队伍，向共产主义的胜利迈进。
