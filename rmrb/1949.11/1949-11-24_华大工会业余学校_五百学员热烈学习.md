　　Hua University Trade Union Spare-time School
　　500 Students Enthusiastically Studying
　　[Reported by this newspaper] The Hua University Trade Union established a spare-time school in early October. Since the school opened on October 10th, the learning enthusiasm of the more than 500 students has been extremely high. Every evening around six o'clock, students carry their "ma zha" (small canvas stools) from various units to the classroom in Tieshizi Hutong to attend classes, with very few absences or late arrivals.

　　In just over a month, the students have made significant progress in their studies. For example, Xue Jiyun, a 51-year-old odd-job worker, who couldn't even understand addition and subtraction in the past, has now learned to solve comprehensive four-operation problems. Zhang Jinglin from the guard team, who was reluctant to attend classes in the past, is now not only studying hard himself and getting good grades on exams, but also helping to guide others in writing diaries and solving arithmetic problems. Gao Hongchang, a cook, had no confidence in learning in the past, thinking that he was too old at over forty years old; now he is also actively writing diaries and learning arithmetic. The spare-time school is divided into four levels and nine classes. The current semester is scheduled from October 10th to December 31st. In addition to natural science and history, the courses for each level are more than one-third completed. The first monthly exam has been completed, and both teachers and students have the confidence to successfully complete the entire teaching plan. (Hua University Correspondent Group)

　　华大工会业余学校
　　五百学员热烈学习
    【本报讯】华大工会于十月初设立业余学校，自十月十日开学以来，五百多学员的学习情绪均极高涨。每天晚上六点钟左右，学员们就背起“马札”（帆布小凳）从各单位到铁狮子胡同教室去上课，缺课迟到的很少。
    一月余来，学员们在学习上已有了显著的成绩。如五十一岁的杂工薛吉云，过去连加减法也弄不清，现在已学会算四则综合题了。警卫队张敬林过去不愿意上课，现在不但自己努力学习，考试成绩很好，而且还能帮助指导别人作日记、演算术题。炊事员高洪昌过去学习毫无信心，认为自己四十多岁老了；现在也积极地作日记学算术。业余学校共分四级九个班，本学期预定由十月十日到十二月三十一日，各级课程除自然、历史外，现已学完三分之一以上，第一次月考已完毕，教员和同学都有胜利完成整个教学计划的信心。　　　　（华大通讯组）
