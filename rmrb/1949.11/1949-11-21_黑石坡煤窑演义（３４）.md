    Thirty-one Liberation

    In April 1947, the People's Liberation Army, originally from the Jin-Cha-Ji liberated area in North China, launched an offensive on the Zhengtai Railway. In a few days, the railway from Huolu in the east to Shouyang in the west was completely liberated. In early May, the People's Liberation Army entered Yangquan.

    As soon as the sound of the PLA's artillery was heard, the world turned upside down. When Yangquan was about to be liberated, the situation in those few large mines changed completely. During that time, the traitor Yan Xishan's troops were not only hurrying to pack up and run away, but also fiercely issuing orders and bragging, forcing the miners to destroy the mines. However, the miners showed a spirit that no one could quite grasp. Even those who were usually half-dead came alive. Everyone was as close as glue, working together to fight the enemy fiercely! How did they fight? When the enemy ordered them to destroy the machines, they hid them. If they were caught by the enemy, they would stall for time, or take the opportunity to dismantle the machines, along with the coal carts and rails, and hide them in the accumulated water at the bottom of the mine... Anyway, everyone was of one mind, using various methods to resist the enemy and protect the mines.

    Da San and the brothers Shuan Cheng worked as hard as everyone else, day and night, for a day or two. It wasn't until noon on the second day of liberation that they went home together. At that time, the three of them were so happy that they couldn't speak. The two brothers Shuan Cheng just kept singing nonsense as they walked, while Da San, like a stove that was about to go out but had been stoked with dry firewood, threw his head back, swung his arms wildly, and strode forward proudly.

    But Black Rock Slope Village was deserted, not as lively as when the traitor Yan Xishan "revived" it. Da San and his brothers wandered around the village for two days, but they rarely saw anyone on the street. Even if they happened to meet two or three people, they would only say a few words in a low voice and then hurry away. Later, Da San ran into Xiao Yangui and asked, "Where have all the people gone? Why are they all so evasive?" Xiao Yangui blinked and said quietly, "People are afraid! They say that the Communists will kill and eat people, leaving no one alive..." When Da San heard this, he got angry and pointed at Xiao Yangui's nose, saying, "Fuck his mother's nonsense! Didn't you see the passing troops?" Xiao Yangui said, "The troops are really not beating or scolding, which is gratifying!" As he spoke, he lowered his voice and moved closer to Da San's shoulder, saying, "But people say it's sweet first and then bitter! Don't you remember 'Communists kill people like...'" Da San's eyes bulged, and he waved his arm, saying, "If they kill a few and eat a few traitors from Yan's army, I'd be happy to be burned and slashed!" Xiao Yangui quickly covered his mouth, but he pushed Xiao Yangui away and strode off.

    Da San then ran into Bian Xiao. Bian Xiao told him that the Ju Bao family had gone to Taiyuan half a month ago, leaving Qian Danao to look after the house. Qian Danao later ran away with the Yan troops on the blockhouse. Bian Xiao quietly said, "Bai Quan's family is still there. Ju Bao told her to leave, but she refused to die." After a pause, Bian Xiao added, "Alas! Her family, those who died are dead, and those who didn't die have fled to escape the famine, leaving her without a place to rest her feet!" Da San acted as if he hadn't heard any of this, and only asked, "What about Yu Bao?" Bian Xiao said, "He's still here. These days, no one is taking care of the passing PLA troops. I heard that he and Lin Bao are the ones who are taking care of them." Da San was taken aback and thought, is he taking charge again? So he hurried away from Bian Xiao to discuss with Shuan Cheng, thinking of going to Yinying tomorrow to find Lao Bai.

    The next day, however, an officer from the Eighth Route Army came to the village, saying that he was there to call Yu Bao and Lin Bao to a meeting in the district. Da San and Shuan Cheng didn't go to Yinying, wanting to wait and see. On the second night, Lin Bao and the others returned from the meeting. Shuan Cheng hurriedly asked Lin Bao what the meeting was about. Lin Bao said, "Oh! I don't understand! They just said to let the people take revenge and stand up, and also said that our village should complete it in seven days, but they didn't say anything else. They also heard that Qian Danao didn't escape and was caught by the Eighth Route Army. He's being held in the district now." Shuan Cheng said, "I heard about that. Niu Bao's gang of self-defense forces was also caught and then released. But how do you take revenge? What are we supposed to do in these seven days?" Lin Bao said, "But I just don't understand! The district said that they will send people to work down here in a few days. Sigh, who knows what's going on! Uncle Shuan Cheng, I think you should do it! We're old and slow-witted, this..." Shuan Cheng quickly said that he couldn't do it either, and asked, "Why did they find Yu Bao again?" Lin Bao said, "Who knows! Anyway, as soon as the Eighth Route Army arrived, he came forward to support them. Alas, we can't do anything! This..." Shuan Cheng said, "Let's wait for the district officers to come and talk about it!" After saying that, Shuan Cheng left.

    一九四七年四月，原来华北晋察冀解放区的人民解放军，对正太铁路发动了进攻，不几天，铁路东起获鹿西到寿阳就全部解放；五月初，人民解放军进入阳泉。
    解放军的炮声一响，世道就天翻地覆。阳泉快要解放的时候，单那几个大矿里的情景，也是澈头澈尾变了样。那阵子，汉奸阎锡山的队伍一面慌忙打点着撒腿跑，一面又凶虎虎地发号令、吹大气，强迫窑黑们破坏矿。窑黑们呢，却谁也看不出是股什么劲头，连平日半死不活的也都活跳起来了，大家如胶似漆地拧成一气，狠狠地跟敌人干！怎么干？敌人叫破坏机器，他们就躲就藏；给敌人抓住了，就泡蘑茹，要不就钻空子把机器拆了，连同煤车、铁轨等等，给藏到窑底的积水里边……反正大家一条心，变着法儿，反抗敌人，保证窑矿。
    大三和拴成弟兄们也和大家一样，没明没夜紧紧张张地干了一两天。直到解放的第二天响午，他们才就伴回去。当时他三人都高兴得说不出话，拴成弟兄俩光顾着一边走一边不停地瞎唱，大三更象一炉快灭火添了干柴又着旺了一般，仰着脖子，大摔着胳膊，挺神气地直往前迈着大步。
    但黑石坡村却冷清清地，还没汉奸阎锡山“复兴”回来那么烘火。大三他们回村转游了两天，街里却轻易见不着人，就是碰对了遇到三两个，也都是悄言悄语地说不上几句，又赶紧走了。后来大三碰见小洋鬼，就问道：“这人们哪去啦？怎么都躲躲闪闪地！”小洋鬼扑展着眼皮悄悄说：“人们正着怕哩！说是共产党来了杀人煮人，鸡犬不留……”大三一听就冒火，指着小洋鬼鼻子道：“肏他妈的瞎扯！没见那过往的队伍么？”小洋鬼说：“那队伍倒真是不打不骂的，可喜人哩！”说着，他却压低嗓门，靠近大三肩膀说：“可人们说是先甜后辣！你不记得‘共产杀人如……’”大三两眼瞪得鼓鼓地，胳膊一挥道：“人家杀几个煮几个汉奸阎军，我挨火烧刀砍也乐意！”小洋鬼忙捂住他的嘴，可他一把推开小洋鬼，直冲冲走了。
    大三又碰见了扁小。扁小告给他：聚宝一家子早在半月前就去了太原，家里丢下乾大脑看管，乾大脑后来也跟炮楼上的阎军跑了；扁小又悄悄说：“白泉家还在。聚宝叫她走，她是死也不。”停了停，扁小又道：“唉！她一家子死的死了，没死的也逃荒走了口，落得她连个歇脚安身的地势也没有的！”大三象没听这些，只问道：“玉宝呢？”扁小说：“他还在。这些天八路队伍往来路过的没人张罗，听说就是他跟林宝俩人在招呼。”大三大吃一惊，心想又是他在拿事？于是他忙撇过扁小，去寻拴成商议，想明天上荫营寻老白去。
    明天，却有个八路军办公的到了村里，听说是来叫玉宝林宝去区里开会；大三和拴成也就没去荫营，想等着看看再说。到第二天黑夜，林宝他们开会回来了，拴成就赶忙问林宝开了什么会，林宝说：“哎呀！闹不清嘛！光说是叫老百姓报仇翻身，还说让咱村七天就要办成，别也没说什么，再就是听说乾大脑没跑脱，给八路军抓住了，这会在区里扣着。”拴成道：“这我听说来着。牛宝那伙自卫团也给抓住了，又放回来了。可你说这仇怎么报？这七天尽办些什么？”林宝说：“可就是闹不清嘛！区上说是三两天就派办工作的下来。嗨，谁可知道怎么闹哩！拴成叔，我看你来干吧！咱这人老心眼笨的，这这……”拴成忙说他也不行，并问：“怎么人家又找上了玉宝？”林宝说：“谁可知道呀！反正八路军队伍刚一到，他就出头支应人家。唉，这咱可没法闹！这这……”拴成说：“等区里办公的来了再说吧！”说完，拴成就走了。
