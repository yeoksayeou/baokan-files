　　A Travelogue of Moscow
  　Chinese Delegation to the World Federation of Trade Unions　Zhou Ming
    　　　　I. Moscow - The Home of Workers Worldwide
    On the afternoon of August 4th, the Chinese delegation to the World Federation of Trade Unions, accompanied by a female expert in Moscow history research, toured the city of Moscow. The large, roofless car departed from the hotel and drove around Moscow, first circling from in front of the Bolshoi Theatre to Red Square, then around the Kremlin's walls, and on to Pushkin Square, Mayakovsky Square…. At each place, the car stopped, the automatic doors opened, and we got out to visit, with the female expert introducing the history of these places.
    As the car turned onto Gorky Street, the female expert said: “In the Tsarist era, this street was very narrow, with crowded traffic and inconvenient pedestrian access. In July 1935, Comrade Stalin signed a decision: the ten-year plan for the reconstruction of Moscow, and put forward several suggestions, one of which was: ‘To eliminate low houses, but not to damage Moscow's historical sites and historical buildings.’ Therefore, in order to preserve the central Kremlin, ancient church buildings, etc., Moscow would have to develop ten kilometers outwards. The Soviet people are building the socialist capital of the country - Moscow, because Moscow is the home of the working class worldwide, it must not only have beautiful and tall buildings, but also be full of flowers, gardens, and lush fruit trees. Moscow is also a large park, welcoming working people from all over the world to visit and tour freely.
    Look! This is the widened Gorky Street, with trolleybuses, large buses, and cars constantly coming and going like schools of fish, not seeming crowded at all. The seven or eight-story high buildings on both sides of Gorky Street house workers' dormitories and agency offices; the ground floors are places for workers to buy food, general merchandise, and get haircuts. The green, neatly arranged trees and the smooth, gleaming asphalt roads on both sides lead to the distant hero city—Stalingrad."
    　　　　II. The Story of Moving Houses
    The car started again, and she continued to introduce….
    She said: “While Gorky Street was being widened, a worker went to a sanatorium for recuperation. His lover wrote to him asking him to come home. When he returned to Gorky Street, he couldn't find his house. He told the police his house number, and the police told him: 'Your house has moved.' And led him to his house. He saw that his home was still the same, except that the house was no longer in its original location.”
    We were very surprised to hear the "story of moving houses." So we asked: How do houses move?
    She said: “When Gorky Street was widened, it would have been a great pity to destroy some seven or eight-story buildings. Soviet engineers, technicians, experts, and workers came up with a method and invented machines that could move houses. During the move, electricity and running water were supplied as usual, and people could still work, eat, and dance in the house. Without realizing it, the house slowly moved over.” To give us a deeper understanding, she explained in more detail: “The house is made of reinforced concrete. The workers first dug deep around the foundation of the house, and then used 'winches' to support the house's focal points (column feet), iron tracks were extended in, and machines were installed under the house. The area where the house was to be moved to was prepared in advance. The machine started, and the house naturally moved over.”
    　　　　III. Underwater Tramway
    The car crossed a large iron bridge and stopped on the banks of the Moscow River. On the glittering river water, steamboats emitting smoke were sailing. Across the river was the Kremlin, and the five-pointed red star on top of the palace shone red in the light of the setting sun. She introduced: "There is an underground tramway running under the Moscow River."
    We were surprised again when we heard this, and asked: "How was the underwater underground tramway built?"
    She said: "When building the underwater underground tramway, Soviet workers encountered great difficulties. There was water and mud under the river, making it impossible to carry out concreting work. Soviet workers, technicians, and engineers came up with a solution and invented machines and chemicals, like giving an injection, injecting the chemicals into the water and mud. The water and mud froze into ice, and then the ice blocks were transported out of the ground one by one with machines, so that the underground tramway could be built smoothly.
    　　　　IV. Learning from the Soviet Union
    In a short few hours, we had a preliminary tour of the city of Moscow. And under the enthusiastic and careful introduction of the female expert who guided us, we realized the amazing creations of the Soviet working class in building the home of the workers of the world—Moscow. This made us deeply feel that when building a new China, our Chinese working class should learn well from the Soviet Union! The Soviet working class is our good teacher in building a new China.

　　莫斯科游城记
  　中国出席世界工联代表团　周明
    　　　　一、全世界工人的家——莫斯科
    八月四日下午，中国出席世界工联代表团，由一位莫斯科历史研究女专家伴同着，游历了莫斯科城。无头的大汽车由旅馆出发，在莫斯科市街到处转，先从莫斯科大戏院门前绕到红场，在克里姆林宫的城垣转了一圈，再到普式庚广场、马雅可夫斯基广场……。每到一处，汽车就停下来，自动车门一开，我们便下车去参观，并由女专家给我们介绍这些地方的历史。
    当汽车转到高尔基大街时，那位女专家说：“在沙皇时代，这条街是很窄小的，车辆来往拥挤，人行也不便。一九三五年七月，斯大林同志签字决定：改造莫斯科十年计划，并提出几个建议，其中一个是：‘要把矮小屋子消灭，但不能破坏莫斯科古迹，和历史性的建筑。’所以为了保存中心的克里姆林宫，古代教堂建筑等，莫斯科城便要向周围十公里外发展。苏维埃人民，建设社会主义国家首都——莫斯科，因为莫斯科是全世界工人阶级的家，不仅要有美丽的高大的房屋建筑，而且要到处是鲜花，林园和茂盛的果树，莫斯科也是一个大公园，欢迎全世界劳动人民自由的来参观，游览。
    看！这是已经放宽了的高尔基大街，无轨电车、大汽车、小汽车象鱼群一样，不断的来往，一点也不显得拥挤。高尔基大街两边的七八层楼的高房，楼上是工人宿舍，机关办公室；楼底下是工人购买食品、百货和理发的场所。那两旁排列着绿色整齐的树木，平坦放光的柏油马路，通向远方的英雄城——斯大林格勒。”
    　　　　二、房子搬家的故事
    汽车又开动了，她继续向我们介绍。……
    她说：“在高尔基大街正在放宽的时候，有一个工人到休养所去休养。他的爱人写信叫他回家来。他回到高尔基大街，找不着自己的住房。他把门牌号码告诉警察，警察告诉他说：‘你的房子搬家了。’并领他找到了住房。他一看家里还是老样子，只是房子已不在原来的地方了。”
    我们听到“房子搬家的故事”觉得很奇怪。便追问：房子怎么搬家呢？
    她说：“高尔基大街放宽时，有的七八层房子，毁了太可惜。苏维埃的工程师、技师、专家、工人们，就想了个办法，发明了机器，使房子能搬家。在搬家的时候，电灯、自来水照常供给，人们仍然可以在房子里办公、吃饭、跳舞，在不知不觉之中，房子就慢慢的搬过去了，”她为了使我们有个更深刻的了解，又详细解释说：“房子是钢骨水泥的，工人们先把房子四周地基挖得很深，然后用‘绞机’把房子重点（柱脚）顶住，铁轨道伸进去，机器按装在房子底下。房子里的电线、自来水管用胶皮管接长。房子所要转移的地盘，先准备好。机器开动，房子自然的就搬过去了。”
    　　　　三、河底电车道
    汽车驰过一座大铁桥，停在莫斯科河畔。闪光的河水上，行驶着冒烟的小火轮船，河对面是克里姆林宫，宫顶上的五角红星，在偏西的太阳光的照耀下闪着红光。她介绍说：“莫斯科河底下有地下电车在行驶。”
    我们一听又惊奇的问：“河底下的地下电车道是怎样修筑的呢？”
    她说：“修筑河底地下电车道的时候，苏维埃的工人们碰到了很大的困难，河底下是有水和泥，不能进行打洋灰的工作。苏维埃的工人、技师和工程师们想出了办法，发明了机器和药水，象打针一样，把药水打进水里和泥里。水和泥冻成了冰，然后再把冰块用机器一块一块的运出地面，才顺利的把地下电车路修筑好。
    　　　　四、向苏联学习
    我们在短短的数小时内，初步地游历了莫斯科城。并且在引导我们的女专家热诚细心的介绍下，认识了苏联工人阶级在建设全世界工人的家—莫斯科中的惊人创造，使我们深深感觉到：在建设新中国的时候，我们中国的工人阶级应该好好的向苏联学习！苏联的工人阶级就是我们建设新中国的良师。
