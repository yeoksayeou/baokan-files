Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 13th: Nanchang Dispatch: Jiangxi Province convened a six-day Youth Work Conference at the end of October, which determined the future direction and tasks of youth work. Over the past five months, the political awareness of the youth masses in Jiangxi Province has been unprecedentedly enhanced. Young people are actively seeking to study revolutionary theory and participate in revolutionary construction work. According to statistics, more than 20,000 young people throughout the province have participated in the army and rural work, and more than 2,000 young people have joined the Youth League. The conference reviewed the main shortcomings in past work: the youth movement had not been widely launched, and the broad masses of young people had not been mobilized in a free hand, so that their enthusiasm could be fully utilized. In some places, the development of the Youth League lagged behind the progressive demands of young people, and there was a serious tendency towards closed-doorism. Based on these circumstances, the conference decided on the direction of youth work in Jiangxi Province in the future: mainly to mobilize and organize the broad masses of young people to participate in agricultural production and the reform of new rural areas, as well as various tasks in building a new culture, and decided to build the Youth League as one of the central tasks of the current youth movement. The conference pointed out that in developing the Youth League, we should prevent the tendency of formalism that is divorced from reality and simply pursues numerical figures.

According to news from Ningxia: The Preparatory Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League of Ningxia Province was formally established on the 4th of this month. Jia Huaiji and other eleven people are members of the preparatory committee, and Li Ziqi is the chairman of the committee. The committee also held its first plenary meeting of the preparatory committee on the same day. The meeting determined the direction and tasks of youth work in the province at present, and determined that the current focus should be on cities and densely populated areas. The meeting pointed out that it is necessary to pay attention to developing, educating, and organizing young workers and students; at the same time, youth work should be gradually extended to rural areas in a planned way according to needs and possibilities, so that urban and rural youth can closely cooperate with the government's current central work, actively assist the government in eliminating special agents and bandits, establish revolutionary order, and mobilize the masses to support the front and implement reasonable burdens. In order to implement the above tasks, the Youth League must solve the urgent demands of the youth masses, strengthen their political and ideological education, pay attention to discovering and cultivating activists among the youth, so that youth work in Ningxia Province can be widely carried out.

    江西青年工作会议决定
    组织青年建设农村
    宁夏青年团筹委会成立
    【新华社北京十三日电】南昌讯：江西省于十月底召开了历时六天的青年工作会议，确定了今后青年工作的方针和任务。五个月来，江西省青年群众的政治觉悟空前提高，青年们积极要求学习革命理论并参加革命建设工作。据统计全省已有两万余青年参加到部队、农村工作，并有二千多名青年加入了青年团。会上检讨了过去工作上主要的缺点是青年运动还没有广泛开展，未能放手发动广大青年群众，使他们的积极性得到充分的发挥。有些地方，青年团的发展落在青年进步要求的后面，存在着较严重的关门主义偏向。根据这些情况，会议决定江西省今后青年工作的方针：主要是发动与组织广大青年群众参加农业生产和新区农村改革以及建设新文化的各项工作，并决定建设青年团为当前青年运动的中心工作之一。会议指出，在发展青年团时，应防止脱离实际及单纯追求数目字的形式主义的倾向。
    据宁夏消息：中国新民主主义青年团宁夏省筹备委员会已于本月四日正式成立。贾怀济等十一人为筹备委员，李子奇为主任委员。该会并于同日召开了第一次全体筹委会议。会上决定了目前该省青年工作的方针和任务，确定当前应以城市和人口集中的地方为青年工作的重点。会上指出必须注意发挥、教育、组织青年工人及学生；同时应根据需要和可能有计划地把青年工作逐步推广到农村，使城乡青年与政府当前中心工作密切配合，积极协助政府肃清特务土匪，建立革命秩序，并发动群众支援前线及实行合理负担等项工作。为实行上述任务，青年团必须解决青年群众的迫切要求，并加强其政治、思想教育，注意发现和培养青年中积极分子，使宁夏省青年工作广泛地展开。
