Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, November 4th: In order to thoroughly eliminate the remaining bandits and ensure the autumn harvest for farmers, the People's Liberation Army and local troops in northern and eastern Fujian are extensively carrying out bandit suppression. In Shaowu County, northern Fujian, the people's armed forces have annihilated more than 300 bandits in the past month, including the capture of 186 bandits from the rank of battalion commander downwards. In Lianjiang County, eastern Fujian, local troops annihilated more than 160 bandits from the rank of battalion commander downwards in mid-October. The county's notorious bandit leader, Chen Weichui, and three others were also captured alive. In Yongtai County, the people's armed forces annihilated more than 90 bandits, including Xu Guocai, a notorious bandit in the Baiyun Mountain area known for murder and arson, in four days from October 22nd to 25th. They also persuaded Huang Dasi, the company commander of the bandit gang, and 30 others to surrender with their weapons. Local armed forces in other counties such as Jian'ou, Chong'an, Gutian, Shunchang, and Minqing have also launched attacks successively. According to incomplete statistics, they have annihilated more than 1,100 bandits in the past month, including more than 500 captured alive, and seized more than 700 various guns. Various places have combined military suppression with political offensives. The Gutian people's armed forces posted slogans everywhere to publicize the PLA's bandit suppression policies. More than 70 bandits have come to surrender. In Yongtai County, a bandit gang surrendered completely under the political offensive, bringing with them more than 60 machine guns and rifles. The people's armed forces also actively assisted the local farmers in the autumn harvest during the gaps in bandit suppression. A platoon of the people's armed forces in Jiangshan County helped the farmers to quickly harvest all the scattered rice in the fields during a heavy rain. Soldiers of a certain battalion of the People's Liberation Army in northern Fujian helped farmers harvest more than 20 mu of rice, and assisted local staff in organizing farmers' associations. Due to the PLA's suppression of bandits, protection, and assistance to farmers in the autumn harvest, the relationship between the military and the people has become increasingly close. Farmers in various places have actively cooperated in the PLA's bandit suppression work. Farmers in a certain area of Jiangshan County, northern Fujian, automatically sent intelligence to the troops and cooperated in launching political offensives against the bandits. More than 20 bandits came to surrender in a few days. Young farmers in Luoyuan, Lianjiang, Linsen and other counties in eastern Fujian have organized bandit prevention teams to implement armed self-defense.
