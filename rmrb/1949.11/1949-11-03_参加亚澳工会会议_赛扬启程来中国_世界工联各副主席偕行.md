Xinhua News Agency, Prague, November 2nd: Louis Saillant, Secretary-General of the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), arrived in Prague at noon on the 1st and is scheduled to depart for Beijing via Moscow on the 2nd to attend the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference. Several WFTU Vice Presidents, including Kuznetsov (Soviet Union), Zupka (Czechoslovakia), Toledano (Mexico), Le Leap (France), Broeker (Netherlands), Piña (Cuba), and Abdoule (Africa), will also travel to Beijing to participate in the conference. WFTU President Vittorio (Italy) is unable to attend due to other commitments.

When reporters met Saillant at the hotel, he was in conversation with Toledano. Both expressed their immense joy at being able to travel to the capital of New China to attend the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference and witness the great and world-significant achievements that the Chinese people have made and are continuing to make. Saillant told reporters: "On the eve of leaving France, I received a reply telegram from Chairman Mao. This telegram from the Head of State of the People's Republic of China is of great importance to the future of consolidating world peace and the cause of the world's working class. For this reason, when I discussed it with several WFTU Executive Committee members in Czechoslovakia, everyone felt very excited."

Toledano gave reporters an overview of the American Peace Conference held in Mexico a few months ago, and introduced the great movement of the American working class and people against the aggressive war conspiracies of American imperialism. He pointed out that although the upper-level leaders of the American Congress of Industrial Organizations are serving the US State Department, millions of American workers are fighting for the cause of peace and democracy. He also cited the facts of the Mexican people's demands for national independence, democracy, and land reform, explaining that the victory of the Chinese people is a great encouragement to the people of Latin American colonies and semi-colonies.

　　参加亚澳工会会议
  　赛扬启程来中国
  　世界工联各副主席偕行
    【新华社布拉格二日电】世界工会联合会总书记路易·赛扬，于一日中午飞抵捷京，定于二日启程经莫斯科前往北京，参加亚澳工会会议。世界工联各副主席——库兹涅佐夫（苏），朱普卡（捷），托列达诺（墨西哥），勒里普（法），布罗克尔（荷兰），皮那（古巴），阿布多勒（非洲）等亦将偕往北京参加会议。世界工联主席维特里奥（意）则因事不能出席。
    当记者在旅馆会到赛扬时，他正在和托列达诺谈话，他们都表示：能去新中国的京城参加亚澳工会会议，看看中国人民所已作和正在进行着的富有世界意义的伟大事业，这是一件无限的快事。赛扬告记者说：“将要离开法国的前夜，我接到毛主席给我的复电，中华人民共和国元首的这个电报，对于巩固世界和平与世界工人阶级事业的前途，有极大的重要性。正因为如此，我和在捷克的几位世界工联执委谈起来，大家都觉得十分兴奋。”
    托列达诺向记者概述了数月前在墨西哥召开的美洲和平大会，并介绍了美洲工人阶级和人民反对美帝国主义侵略战争阴谋的巨大运动。他指出，虽然美国的产业工会联合会的上层领导者们为美国国务院服务，但是，千千万万的美国工人，却是为和平民主事业而奋斗的。他并引举墨西哥人民要求民族独立、民主与土地改革的事实，说明中国人民的胜利对于拉丁美洲殖民地、半殖民地的人民是一个极大的鼓励。
