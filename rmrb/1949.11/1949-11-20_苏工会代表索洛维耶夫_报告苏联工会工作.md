　　Soviet Trade Union Representative Soloviev
  　Reports on Soviet Trade Union Work

    Soviet Trade Union Central Council Delegation leader Soloviev reported on Soviet trade union work at the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference today. Soloviev first extended warm fraternal greetings on behalf of all Soviet trade unions, Soviet workers and staff, and all Soviet working people to the conference and to all working people in Asian countries. Soloviev pointed out that the Soviet people have always paid close attention with deep sympathy to the struggles of trade unions in Asian countries to win economic and social rights, people's democracy, and national independence for the working people. Soloviev especially extended fraternal greetings on behalf of the Soviet trade unions to the heroic Chinese people who have achieved a historic victory by crushing the combined forces of domestic reactionaries and international imperialism. He pointed out: "New Democratic China is the backbone of the Asian people in the struggle against international imperialism and for freedom and independence. The Soviet people will fully support the Chinese working people in their struggle to consolidate and develop the People's Republic of China." He said: "The Soviet trade unions and all the Soviet people sincerely hope that the young People's Republic of China and its working class, trade unions, and all working people will achieve great success in resolving the current historical task of building a new, unified, independent, prosperous, and strong democratic China."

    When starting to report on Soviet trade union work, Soloviev first reviewed the economic, social, and cultural conditions of Tsarist Russia before the Soviet revolution. He listed facts and figures to illustrate the tragic situation of Russian workers, peasants, women, and various ethnic minorities under Tsarist rule. Soloviev then pointed out that, thanks to the victory of socialism in the Soviet Union, this situation no longer exists. The construction after the Soviet revolution has achieved great success. Between the first and second world wars, when the industries of the major capitalist countries were stagnant, the industry of the Soviet Union increased twelvefold. During the period of several Stalin Five-Year Plans, tens of thousands of new factories were built. The rich peasants were eliminated, the countryside was collectivized, and all the working people enjoyed a rich cultural life. Soloviev cited that in 1948, there were 23 million students in primary and secondary schools and one million students each in specialized schools and universities throughout the Soviet Union. There were 100,000 scientific workers throughout the Soviet Union; while in pre-revolutionary Russia, the vast majority of the people were illiterate, and there were only a few thousand scientific workers. The October Socialist Revolution also eliminated national inequality in Tsarist Russia. With the help of the Soviet government, various ethnic minorities in the Soviet Union have established their own countries and developed their own cultures. Soloviev specifically cited the example of the Soviet Socialist Republics of Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan, which are located in Asia, to illustrate this great change. He pointed out that in 1913, Kyrgyzstan had only 55 small handicraft factories, but now it has more than 7,000 large enterprises. In 1948, Kyrgyzstan's industrial production was 326 times that of 1913. In Uzbekistan, people dug the Fergana Canal, which is 270 kilometers long, in one and a half months. In Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, countless kilometers of canals are being dug, and thousands of miles of desert will become fertile land. Compared with before the revolution, the total number of primary and secondary school students in Uzbekistan has increased 64 times, and in Tajikistan, it has increased 660 times. During the era of Soviet power, the culture of socialist content in national forms of various ethnic groups in the Central Asian Soviet Socialist Republics has achieved true prosperity. Soloviev emphasized: "The great leader Comrade Stalin called for lighting the beacon of socialism in the Soviet East. Today, we can proudly say that Comrade Stalin's instructions have been realized in the republics of Central Asia. The beacon of socialism shines brightly in the East!"

    Soloviev then talked about how the Soviet social and state system proved to be incomparably superior to the capitalist system in the Great Patriotic War. He pointed out the enormous losses caused to the Soviet Union by the German fascist invaders. The invaders looted and destroyed 31,850 factories, thousands of state farms and machine tractor stations, tens of thousands of collective farms, and hundreds of thousands of shops, cultural institutions, and transportation stations. The direct losses caused by the invaders to the Soviet state and people totaled 679 billion rubles, equivalent to 138 billion US dollars. The total losses caused by the war, plus war expenses, totaled 357 billion US dollars. No non-socialist country could have sustained such enormous losses. However, Soloviev pointed out that the Soviet people completed the task of shifting industrial production to peaceful construction in a short period of time after the end of the war. By 1948, Soviet industry had exceeded its pre-war level. By June of this year, the average daily total output of Soviet industry had exceeded that of 1940 by 41 percent. This year, Soviet agricultural production has also exceeded the level of 1940. The living standards of the Soviet people are steadily rising.

    Soloviev then pointed out the great role played by Soviet trade unions in the great post-war construction of the Soviet Union. He said: "From the very beginning, Soviet trade unions have implemented the instructions of Lenin and Stalin. During the pre-war Five-Year Plan periods, they organized the creative activities of the masses to complete the plans for national industrialization and agricultural collectivization; during the years of the Great Patriotic War, they organized and educated the masses, so that all their activities were subject to the realization of the Soviet government's slogan, namely: 'Everything for the front, everything for victory!' And in the years of post-war construction, "Soviet trade unions led the socialist competition movement to complete the post-war Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. They cultivated a high degree of love for socialist wealth among the broad masses of workers and staff, fought to overcome the remnants of capitalism in people's consciousness, carried out Soviet patriotic education among the masses, and constantly cared about the improvement of the material living conditions of workers and staff." Soloviev emphasized: "In the Soviet Union, every worker is the master of his own motherland and the master of the enterprise in which he works. Every worker strives to achieve the maximum effect in his work, because he realizes that this will strengthen the strength of his motherland, increase the happiness of all the people, and thus improve his personal living conditions." This is fundamentally different from capitalist countries, where workers will face unemployment for increasing labor productivity. Soloviev pointed out that the Soviet people, who have shaken off the shackles of capitalism and become masters of their own destiny, have generated endless strength. The Soviet people are using all their skills and experience to save money, raw materials, fuel, and electricity, and to use machine equipment better. They use methods such as mastering technology, production rationalization, and improving labor organization to increase labor productivity. The constructive ideas of Stakhanovite innovators have penetrated every department of the national economy, and no production process has not been affected by the good influence of the leaders of the competition movement. Workers not only strive to improve their own work, but also help backward comrades and pass on their experience to them. Soloviev pointed out that the result of the Soviet people's increased labor productivity has also increased their wages. Because Soviet wages are paid according to the amount and quality of labor, according to socialist principles. Soloviev then spoke of the enormous rise in the living standards of Soviet workers after the war, which is not only due to increased wages, but also to the increasing scale of social welfare (which increases the income of the working people by one-third more than wages), and to the Soviet government's price reductions (which increased the real wages of Soviet workers in 1948 by more than double compared to 1947). Soloviev then talked about the Soviet Union's massive housing construction plans, social insurance funds, free medical services, and improved working conditions. He pointed out that in the current Five-Year Plan, the amount paid by the state for labor insurance is twice the sum of this expenditure in the first two pre-war Five-Year Plans. Soloviev also talked about the Soviet trade unions' cultural and educational activities, the purpose of which is to improve the political, cultural, and technical level of the workers. The cultural and educational activities of the trade unions have helped eliminate the difference between physical and mental labor, which is a prominent feature of capitalist society. Every worker and staff member in the Soviet Union can receive education in specialized schools while working in production organizations.

    Soloviev finally spoke of the high enthusiasm and significant role played by Soviet workers in the movement to defend peace. He exposed the activities of the imperialists using reactionary trade union scabs to split the international working class, denounced the conspiratorial activities of the so-called "Asian Labor Federation," and called on the working class of the whole world to unite more closely around the World Federation of Trade Unions. He also expressed the Soviet delegation's full support for the establishment of a Liaison Bureau for Asian-Australian Trade Unions of the World Federation of Trade Unions.

　　苏工会代表索洛维耶夫
  　报告苏联工会工作
    【新华社北京十九日电】苏联工会中央理事会代表团团长索洛维耶夫今日在亚澳工会会议上报告苏联工会工作。索洛维耶夫首先代表苏联各工会，代表苏联工人职员和苏联全体劳动人民向大会，并向亚洲各国全体劳动人民致热烈的兄弟的敬礼。索洛维耶夫指出苏联人民一直以深切的同情注视亚洲各国工会为劳动人民争取经济和社会权利、人民民主、民族独立的斗争。索洛维耶夫特别代表苏联工会向粉碎了国内反动派和国际帝国主义的联合力量而取得历史性胜利的英勇的中国人民，致兄弟的敬礼。他指出：“新民主主义的中国，是亚洲人民在反对国际帝国主义，争取自由和独立的斗争中的中坚。苏联人民将全力支持为巩固和发展中华人民共和国而斗争的中国劳动人民。”他说：“苏联工会和全体苏联人民衷心地希望年轻的中华人民共和国和他的工人阶级、工会，以及全体劳动人民，在解决当前建设一个新的统一、独立、富强、繁荣的民主中国这一历史任务方面，获得巨大的成就。”
    在开始报告苏联工会工作时，索洛维耶夫首先回顾苏联革命以前沙皇俄国的经济、社会、文化条件，他历举事实与数字，说明俄国工人、农民、妇女与各少数民族，在沙皇治下的悲惨情形。索洛维耶夫接着指出：由于社会主义在苏联的胜利，这种情形，现在已不复存在了。苏联革命后的建设，获得了伟大的成就。在第一第二两次世界大战之间，当各主要资本主义国家的工业都停滞不前时，苏联的工业却增加了十二倍。在几个斯大林五年计划的时期中，建设了几万个新的工厂。富农被消灭，农村实现了集体化，全体劳动人民得到了丰足的文化生活。索洛维耶夫举出：在一九四八年，全苏联中小学有学生二千三百万，专门学校与高等学校各有学生一百万。全苏联有十万科学工作者；而在革命前的俄国，绝大多数人民都是文盲，科学工作者只有几千人。十月社会主义革命，也消灭了沙皇俄国的民族不平等。苏联境内的各少数民族都在苏联政府帮助之下，建立了自己的国家，发展了自己的文化。索洛维耶夫特别以位于亚洲的哈萨克、土克曼、乌兹别克、吉尔吉斯、塔吉克等苏维埃社会主义共和国为例，说明这一伟大的变化。他指出：一九一三年吉尔吉斯只有五十五家小手工业工厂，而现在却有七千多家大企业。一九四八年吉尔吉斯的工业生产是一九一三年的三百二十六倍。在乌兹别克，人民在一个半月内就凿成了全长二百七十公里的费尔干运河。在哈萨克与土克曼，无数公里的运河正在开凿，千里沙漠将成为沃土。与革命前相比，乌兹别克中小学的学生总数，已增加了六十四倍，在塔吉克，已增加了六百六十倍。在苏维埃政权的年代中，中亚细亚苏维埃社会主义共和国的各族人民的民族形式的、社会主义内容的文化，得到了真正的繁荣。索洛维耶夫强调指出：“伟大的领袖斯大林同志，曾号召在苏维埃的东方，燃起社会主义的灯塔。今天，我们可以骄傲地说：斯大林同志的指示，已经在中亚细亚各共和国里实现了。社会主义的灯塔辉煌地照耀着东方！”
    索洛维耶夫接着讲到苏维埃社会与国家制度如何在伟大卫国战争中，证明它是无比地优越于资本主义制度。他指出德国法西斯侵略者给苏联造成的巨大损失。侵略者劫掠并毁灭了三万一千八百五十个工厂，几千个国营农场和机器拖拉机站，几万个集体农场，几十万个商店，文化机关与交通运输站。侵略者给苏维埃国家和人民造成的直接损失，共达六千七百九十亿卢布，等于一千三百八十亿美元。由于战争所造成的全部损失，加上战费，共达三千五百七十亿美元。任何非社会主义国家，都不能支持这样浩大的损失。但是，索洛维耶夫指出，苏联人民在战争胜利结束后短时期内，就完成了将工业生产转向和平建设的任务。到了一九四八年，苏联工业就已超过战前的水平。到了今年六月，苏联工业的每日平均总产量，已超过一九四○年百分之四十一。今年苏联的农业生产，也已超过了一九四○年的水平。苏联人民的生活水平，正在稳步上升。
    索洛维耶夫接着指出，苏联工会在苏联伟大的战后建设中所起的伟大作用。他说：苏联工会从一开始就执行了列宁、斯大林的指示，在战前五年计划时期中，组织了群众的创造性活动，来完成国家工业化与农业集体化的计划；在伟大卫国战争的年代中，它组织和教育了群众，使他们的一切活动，都服从于实现苏联政府的口号，就是：“一切为前线，一切为胜利！”而在战后建设的年代中，“苏联工会领导了为提前完成战后五年计划的社会主义竞赛运动。他们在广大的工人和职员群众中。培养起对社会主义财富的高度爱护，为克服人们意识中的资本主义的残余而斗争，在群众中进行苏维埃爱国主义的教育，并不断地关心工人和职员们物质生活条件的改进。”索洛维耶夫着重说：“在苏联，每一个劳动者都是自己祖国的主人，都是他所工作的那个企业的主人。每一个劳动者都竭力想使自己的工作达到最大的效果，因为他认识到这将加强自己祖国的力量，增进全体人民的幸福，因而将改善他个人的生活条件。”这与资本主义国家里，工人会为了提高劳动生产率而遭到失业是根本不同的。索洛维耶夫指出：摆脱了资本主义枷锁而成为自己命运主宰的苏联人民，产生了无穷无尽的力量。苏联人民正在用自己全部的技能和经验，以节省金钱、原料、燃料、电力，更好地使用机器装备。他们用掌握技术、生产合理化和改进劳动组织等方法来提高劳动生产率。斯达哈诺夫革新者的建设性思想，已经深入国民经济的每一个部门，没有一种生产过程，不曾受到竞赛运动的领袖们的好影响。工人不仅尽力改进自己的工作，并且还帮助落后的同志，把自己的经验传授给他们。索洛维耶夫指出：苏联人民提高劳动生产率的结果，同时也提高了他们的工资。因为苏联的工资，是根据社会主义的原则，按照劳动的数量和质量而付钱的。索洛维耶夫接着说到苏联工人生活水平，在战后的巨大上升，这不仅是由于工资的增加，而且也由于规模日益增大的社会福利（这使劳动人民的收入较工资增加三分之一），由于苏联政府之降低物价（这使苏联工人一九四八年的实际工资，比一九四七年增加一倍有余）。索洛维耶夫接着谈到苏联庞大的房屋建筑计划、社会保险基金、免费的医疗服务与劳动条件的改进。他指出，在目前的五年计划中，国家为劳动保险而付出的款项，为战前头两个五年计划这笔支出的总和的两倍。索洛维耶夫又谈到苏联工会的文化教育活动，这种活动的目的，是为了提高劳动者的政治文化技术水平。工会的文教活动，已帮助消除了作为资本主义社会显著特征的体力与脑力劳动间的差别。苏联每一个工人和职员，在生产机关中工作时都能在专门的学校中受到教育。
    索洛维耶夫最后说到苏联工人在保卫和平运动中表现的高度热忱与其重大作用。他揭露帝国主义假手反动工贼所进行的分裂国际工人阶级的活动，痛斥所谓“亚洲劳工联盟”的阴谋活动，并号召全世界工人阶级更紧密地团结在世界工联的周围。他并表示苏联代表团完全支持设立世界工联亚澳工会联络局。
