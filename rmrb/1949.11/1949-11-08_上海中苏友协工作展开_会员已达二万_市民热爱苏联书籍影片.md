Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 7th: Since the preparatory committee of the Shanghai branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association was established on September 3rd, it has been actively carrying out its work. In the past two months, the number of members applying for membership has reached 20,000. The Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Women's Federation, the Public Works Bureau, the Textile and Dyeing Workers Association, the Customs, the Foreign Affairs Office, and other organizations have been actively preparing to establish branch associations. In addition to developing membership and assisting in the establishment of branch associations, the preparatory committee of the branch association has successively hosted a memorial evening for the famous Soviet scientist Pavlov and a special lecture on Pavlov. During the week of the International Day for the Struggle for Peace, a seven-day lecture meeting was held, introducing the lives of Soviet workers, women and children respectively. After each lecture, Soviet films were screened to match the content of the lecture. To celebrate the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the Soviet Union, a Sino-Soviet Friendship Evening was held. When the delegation of Soviet cultural, artistic and scientific workers arrived in Shanghai, the association convened a welcome rally of 15,000 people from all walks of life. In addition, two Soviet photo exhibitions have been held successively to introduce the socialist construction of the Soviet Union. The preparatory committee has also established three Russian supplementary night schools, with more than 800 people signing up to learn Russian.

Also: The publishing and film circles in Shanghai have made significant achievements in exchanging Sino-Soviet cultural works. Xinhua, Times, Sanlian, Kaiming, Zhonghua, Commercial Press and other bookstores have published and sold more than 570 kinds of Soviet books, about 697,000 copies, among which theoretical books such as the Short Course of the History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), Foundations of Leninism, and On the State are the most popular. Krupskaya's "Learning Work Methods from Lenin" is even more popular among general readers. As Shanghai youth have begun to enthusiastically learn Russian, Russian textbooks are in short supply. In order to facilitate the learning of Russian, many books have been published in both Chinese and Russian versions for parallel reading. In terms of films, since August, first-run and second-run cinemas have been showing Soviet films, among which "A Teacher in the Country" (i.e. Rural Teacher), "Lenin in 1918" and "The Soviet Union Today" are the most loved by audiences.

　　上海中苏友协工作展开
  　会员已达二万
  　市民热爱苏联书籍影片
    【新华社上海七日电】中苏友好协会上海分会筹备委员会于九月三日成立后，积极展开工作。两个月来，申请入会的会员已达二万人。市总工会、家庭妇女联合会、工务局、纺织染工作者协会、海关、外侨事务处等团体机关，都纷纷筹备成立支会。分会筹委会除发展会员和协助成立支会外，曾先后主持了苏联名科学家巴甫洛夫纪念晚会，巴甫洛夫专题演讲会。在国际和平斗争日的宣传周中，曾举行七天的演讲会，分别介绍苏联工人、妇女和儿童生活，每次演讲会后，配合演讲内容，放映苏联电影。为庆祝中苏建立邦交，曾举行中苏联欢晚会。当苏联文化、艺术、科学工作者代表团抵沪时，该会曾召开一万五千人的各界欢迎大会。此外，并先后举行苏联照片展览会两次，介绍苏联社会主义的建设。筹委会又举办了三个俄文补习夜校，报名要求学习俄文的已达八百多人。
    又：上海出版界影剧界，在交流中苏文化工作上已有显著成绩。新华、时代、三联、开明、中华、商务等书店出版和销售苏联书籍五百七十余种，约六十九万七千余册，其中理论书籍如联共（布）党史简明教程、列宁主义基础、论国家等书销路最为旺盛。克鲁普斯卡亚所著“向列宁学习工作方法”一书则更为一般读者所欢迎。由于上海青年开始热心学习俄文，俄文读本供不应求。为了学习俄文的方便，许多书籍都出版中俄文本两种，以便对读。电影方面，自八月份起，头二三轮影院均放映苏联影片，其中以“桃李满天下”（即乡村女教师）、“列宁在一九一八年”、“今日之苏联”等影片，最为观众所热爱。
