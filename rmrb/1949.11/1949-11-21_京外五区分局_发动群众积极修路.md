　　Outer Fifth District Branch
  　Mobilizes the Masses to Actively Repair Roads
    [Beijing News] In mid-November, the Construction Bureau launched a road repair campaign in all districts of the city, designating the Outer Fifth District to repair nine main roads and allocating more than 7,900 jin of millet as road repair expenses. After receiving this task, the Outer Fifth Branch, after research, decided to repair all the roads once to avoid the difficulty of muddy roads after rain next spring. Regarding the use of millet, in addition to the branch uniformly producing banners and flags for model police stations, model neighborhoods, groups, and model individuals, the remaining millet will be used in a work-for-food relief manner, distributed to various police stations to mobilize the poorest and most needy masses to participate in road repair. After obtaining the consent of the Construction Bureau, work was immediately launched. Since the 15th, the masses in each police station have enthusiastically participated. Many old men and women forgot their age, and the working laborers also actively participated. Ignoring the advice of the comrades in the police station, they wielded iron shovels and worked hard. In order to coordinate the progress of the work, the branch headquarters used radio broadcasts and express reports to exchange experience, report on models, and encourage the labor enthusiasm of the masses. It also mobilized a large number of police officers to go to the streets to help the masses repair roads during off-duty hours.
    In the past four or five days, the masses in the Outer Fifth District not only repaired most of the roads within their boundaries with their own hands, but also repaired the stone bridges near Longzhua Huai, the Flour Mill, and Dongxiaoshi, and renovated the slopes of the Longxu Ditch, facilitating the passage of pedestrians and vehicles.

　　京外五区分局
  　发动群众积极修路
    【京市讯】本月中旬，建设局在全市各区发动修路，指定外五区要修整九条干路，并发给七千九百多斤小米，做为修路费用。外五分局接到这个任务后，经研究结果，决定将路普修一次，以免明年春天下雨后泥泞难行。对小米的运用，除由分局统一制作模范派出所、模范闾、组及模范人的锦标、锦旗外，其余小米用以工代赈的方式，分配各派出所，发动最穷苦而需要救济的群众参加修路。于征得建设局同意后，即展开工作。自十五日起开始修路，各派出所群众均以最大的热情踊跃参加。许多老大爷老大娘们忘了年老，劳动的工人们也积极参加，不听派出所同志的劝说，就舞起铁铣辛勤的劳动起来。分局本部为了配合工作的进展，用广播、快报生产交流经验，报导模范，鼓舞群众劳动热情，并动员大批干警在下班休息的时间到街上去帮助群众修路。
    四五日以来，外五区的群众不但用自己的双手修好界内大部分的道路，还修好了龙爪槐、粉厂、及东晓市附近地方的石桥，修整了龙须沟的沟坡，便利了行人车马的通行。
