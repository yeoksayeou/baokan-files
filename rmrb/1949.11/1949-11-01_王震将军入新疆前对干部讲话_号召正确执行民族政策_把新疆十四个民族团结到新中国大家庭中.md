Xinhua News Agency, Jiuquan, 30th. Before a unit of the People's Liberation Army was ordered to enter Xinjiang, a meeting of senior military cadres was held, attended by Wang Zhen, Commander and Political Commissar of the First Army Corps, who delivered a speech. He first described how the First Field Army of the People's Liberation Army, under the leadership of Vice Chairman and Commander Peng of the Military Commission, executed Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu's order to advance bravely, basically annihilating the main force of the Kuomintang bandit army in Northwest China, and assisted patriotic Kuomintang General Tao Zhiyue and others to revolt with their troops, break away from the Kuomintang reactionary camp, and participate in the people's revolution. Therefore, the Northwest Liberation War has already ended victoriously. Commander Wang continued, pointing out that the Xinjiang issue was able to be resolved peacefully due to the revolutionary united front of the CCP Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and the political influence of adopting a lenient policy and democratic reorganization methods towards enemy troops willing to accept a peaceful resolution; it was due to the heroic and tenacious struggle of the progressive forces of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang, especially the revolutionary forces of the autonomous region. In particular, the People's Liberation Army bravely advanced and reached the gate of Xinjiang. The majority of officers and soldiers of the Kuomintang reactionary faction's army hoped for peace, and the most reactionary senior officers were forced to flee, enabling patriotic elements among the senior Kuomintang generals, such as Xinjiang's Tao Zhiyue, Zhao Xiguang, and progressive democrats like Xinjiang Province Chairman Burhan, to turn to the people and telegraph their revolt, breaking away from the Kuomintang reactionary government, accepting the orders of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission, and awaiting democratic reorganization. The peaceful liberation of Xinjiang is beneficial to the people. Commander Wang continued, saying that Xinjiang has a vast territory, complex ethnicities, and deep religious beliefs among its more than four million people from fourteen ethnic groups, the majority of whom, except for over two hundred thousand Han Chinese, believe in Islam and Buddhism. The reactionary rulers and Han Chinese armies and government officials who have historically come out of the pass, especially the Kuomintang reactionaries and their reactionary armies in recent decades, colluded with corrupt and reactionary elements among the various ethnic groups in Xinjiang, implementing a cruel and oppressive rule of conquest and plunder against the people of all ethnic groups. The people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang have always opposed the cruel oppression and exploitation of internal and external reactionaries, and they have launched countless heroic struggles against reactionary oppression. We are going to Xinjiang to correctly implement the ethnic policies of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, which is the full spirit of the ethnic policies stipulated in the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. We must study the theories and strategies of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin on ethnic and religious issues and learn from the Soviet Union's experience. We should appreciate the heroic, resolute, and tenacious struggles of the military, civilians, and cadres of the Xinjiang Autonomous Region, and their contribution to the Chinese people's revolution. Our march into Xinjiang is the convergence of revolutionary forces inside and outside the pass. We should express a warm spirit of revolutionary friendship and learn from their experience and lessons in the anti-oppression struggles of various ethnic groups, uniting the more than four million people of the fourteen ethnic groups in Xinjiang into the friendly and cooperative great family of the People's Republic of China. We hold high Chairman Mao's great banner of the united front of the Chinese people's revolution and must adhere to the firm revolutionary position of the proletariat when working in Xinjiang. This is incompatible with an attitude of arrogance, self-importance, impatience, and recklessness. Therefore, we should adopt a sincere and warm attitude of welcome and unity towards the officers and soldiers of the uprising army, helping them to reorganize, train, and establish revolutionary political work, change their style, change military-civilian relations and officer-soldier relations, implement the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention, and transform them into an army that serves the people. Commander Wang emphasized the conditions for building Xinjiang. The Soviet Union is the peace fortress leading the world in the fight against imperialist aggression. In the future, the construction of the whole country and the construction of Xinjiang, in addition to the efforts of the people of the whole country and the people of Xinjiang, must adopt a friendly attitude towards the great socialist country—the Soviet Union, and humbly learn from the Soviet Union's science and technology of nation-building to build a new Xinjiang. He called on everyone to enter Xinjiang under the personal leadership of Comrade Peng Dehuai, and it is imperative to maintain revolutionary vigilance and discipline, not forgetting the conspiracies of imperialist warmongers and domestic counter-revolutionaries to attempt a restoration, not damaging the glorious tradition of the People's Liberation Army's arduous struggle, and regarding themselves as shock brigades of labor, launching a great production movement to build Xinjiang and build the motherland.

　　王震将军入新疆前对干部讲话
  　号召正确执行民族政策
    把新疆十四个民族团结到新中国大家庭中
    【新华社酒泉三十日电】人民解放军一部于奉命开入新疆之前夕，曾召开全军高级干部会议，第一兵团司令兼政委王震出席讲话。他首先叙述了人民解放军第一野战军在军委彭副主席兼司令员领导下，执行毛主席朱总司令奋勇前进的命令，基本上歼灭了大西北国民党匪军主力，援助了国民党将领中的爱国分子陶峙岳将军等率部起义，脱离国民党反动阵营，参加人民革命。因此，西北解放战争已经胜利结束。王司令员继续指出：新疆问题所以能获得和平解决，这是由于中共中央和毛主席的革命统一战线，与对愿意接受和平解决方式的敌军采取宽大政策与民主改编方法的政治影响；是由于新疆各族人民的进步力量特别是自治区革命力量的英勇顽强斗争。尤其是人民解放军奋勇前进，打到了新疆的大门口，国民党反动派所辖的军队大多数官兵希望和平，最反动的高级军官被迫逃走，使得国民党高级将领中的爱国分子如新疆陶峙岳、赵锡光和进步民主人士新疆省主席鲍尔汉先生等，归向人民，并通电起义，脱离国民党反动政府，接受人民革命军事委员会的命令，听候民主改编。新疆能够和平解放，这对人民是有利的。王司令继称：新疆境域辽阔，民族复杂，人民宗教信仰很深，在十四个民族四百余万人民中除二十余万汉族外，大部信奉回教与佛教。历来出关的反动统治者汉人军队及政府官吏，特别是近几十年的国民党反动派及其反动军队，勾结新疆各族人民中的腐化反动分子，对各族人民实行征服和掠夺的残酷压迫统治。新疆各族人民一向是反对内外反动派的残酷压迫剥削，他们曾发起了无数次反抗反动压迫的英勇斗争。我们去新疆，是为了正确执行党中央和毛主席的民族政策，也就是人民政协共同纳领中所规定的民族政策的全部精神，必须研究马、恩、列、斯关于民族问题与宗教问题的理论与策略，学习苏联的经验；应该估计新疆自治区军民和干部英勇、坚决、顽强的斗争功绩，及其与中国人民革命遥相配合的贡献。我们进军新疆是关内外革命力量的汇合，应该表示热诚的革命友爱精神，学习他们各民族反压迫斗争的经验教训，把新疆十四个民族四百余万人民团结到中华人民共和国友爱合作的大家庭中来。我们高举毛主席的中国人民革命统一战线的团结大旗，去新疆工作，必须坚持无产阶级坚定的革命立场，这是与妄自尊大急躁鲁莽的态度不相容的。因此，我们对起义军队的官兵，应采取诚恳热诚的欢迎团结态度，帮助其改编、整训、建立革命的政治工作，改变作风，改变军民关系，官兵关系，实行三大纪律八项注意，使之变成为人民服务的军队。王司令员强调指出建设新疆的条件。苏联是领导世界反帝国主义侵略的和平堡垒。今后全国的建设和新疆的建设，除了全国人民和新疆人民的努力而外，必须对伟大的社会主义国家——苏联采取友好态度，虚心学习苏联建国的科学和技术，来建设新的新疆。他号召大家在彭德怀同志的亲自领导下进入新疆，务须保持革命的警惕性和纪律性，不要忘记帝国主义战争贩子和国内反革命企图复辟的阴谋，不要损坏人民解放军艰苦奋斗的光荣传统，将自己作为劳动的突击队，掀起建设新疆、建设祖国的大生产运动。
