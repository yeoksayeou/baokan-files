Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, November 27th: The Northeast People's Government recently convened a meeting of mayors and county heads from eleven cities and counties in the Northeast—Shenyang, Harbin, Changchun, Jilin, Benxi, Fushun, Anshan, Dalian, Jinzhou, Tieling, and Liaoyang—to study and summarize the experiences of the first People's Representative Conferences in various cities, to serve as a reference for the upcoming second People's Representative Conferences in these areas. Chairman Gao Gang and Vice Chairman Lin Feng personally presided over the meeting, which lasted three days. On the final day, Chairman Gao Gang gave a summary. In his summary, Chairman Gao first made an overall assessment of the achievements of the People's Representative Conferences in various cities, saying: As of now, sixty-three cities with populations over 30,000 in the Northeast have held People's Representative Conferences. These conferences, with the working class and other laboring people as the main body, united the petty bourgeoisie, national bourgeoisie, and democratic figures from all walks of life, and resolved some of the pressing issues that the masses urgently demanded to be addressed, such as the signing of collective labor-management contracts, determining rent, and resolving municipal issues such as sanitation and water and electricity. In particular, the signing of collective labor-management contracts has concretized the policy of benefiting both labor and management, and both sides have increased their enthusiasm for production. This is currently the best way to resolve labor-management relations. Areas that have not yet signed labor-management contracts should do so immediately. In addition, at several representative conferences, valuable opinions and well-intentioned criticisms were put forward to the government, which was extremely helpful in improving government work, proving that this type of representative conference is the best way to combat bureaucracy, further connect the government with the masses, and mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses. It is also the basic organizational form of the people's regime. However, many conferences were held perfunctorily, with some formalism, attempting to solve too many problems, resulting in none being solved. Or, many resolutions were made (such as one hundred and three resolutions made by a county in Songjiang), and some resolutions were not currently feasible (such as proposing agricultural mechanization), so the people were not interested, and the government found it difficult to fulfill them. This is a practice of being divorced from the masses and must be changed.

Secondly, Chairman Gao Gang corrected some deviations in understanding the People's Representative Conferences. He said that some people still do not understand the important significance of the People's Representative Conferences, believing that they are temporary gatherings held to complete tasks from higher levels or to carry out orders; or that they are old-fashioned councils, "semi-cadre meetings," and so on. The fundamental reason for these misconceptions is a lack of understanding that the People's Representative Conferences are meetings where the people exercise their power to solve their current problems; they are the best form for the government to solve various problems. He pointed out: Many cadres are accustomed to conveying policies through cadre meetings in the past and solving problems through district and street governments; they are not accustomed to convening People's Representative Conferences, where representatives from various democratic classes jointly consult and discuss, decide on the government's work guidelines and methods, and solve the urgent problems that the masses need to solve. This is a current difficulty for us; we must overcome this difficulty to hold the People's Representative Conferences well. Facts have proved that after several cities held these People's Representative Conferences, and policies met the masses, we truly and vividly understood the dynamics of all classes, and the policies became the direction of action for the broad masses of the people.

Chairman Gao Gang then pointed out that in order for the conference to reflect the opinions of the masses well, the people's representatives should basically be elected according to industry and trade, and must not be elected with streets as the basic unit. A few without a fixed industry can be appointed by the government as representatives (such as one per district). For a few extremely poor representatives who cannot afford to lose work, the industry or trade union they represent should provide a subsidy equivalent to the wages of ordinary workers. In this conference, the proportion of representatives from certain city organs and military units was relatively large. In the future, the proportion of such representatives should be reduced. In addition to those elected as representatives according to a certain proportion, other personnel who need to participate due to work relations can take the approach of attending as observers. In some cities, private industrial and commercial representatives outnumbered employee representatives, in some cities, state-owned enterprise representatives were excessive, and in a few regions, Communist Party member representatives were excessive. Appropriate adjustments should be made at the next meeting. Localities should gradually absorb good representatives, and the masses can replace bad representatives at any time, so that the organization of the representative assembly gradually tends to perfection. Attention must be paid to the breadth of representation, but there should also be no凑数 (just making up the numbers to meet a quota). The People's Representative Conference is a regular organization and system, the basic organizational form of the regime. It should be held once a month or two months, generally for one day each time, at least half a day, at most two days; if there is nothing to do, it should not be held, but it must not exceed two months without a meeting. Each meeting must focus on the center and solve one or two specific problems that the masses urgently demand to be solved. Too many or too general problems will certainly not be solved well. At the same time, the problems to be solved by the representative conference should be closely linked to the government's daily work, so that there will be no crash programs, chaos, or delays in work for the sake of holding meetings.

Finally, Chairman Gao Gang instructed everyone on how to hold the People's Representative Conferences well in the future. He said that the central issue is to have full preparation. The mayor, county head, and the government should prepare administrative reports or work reports or work summaries, but these reports or summaries should not be lengthy, all-encompassing, verbose, and empty; the conference should prepare draft resolutions for the problems that must be solved in advance, but there should not be too many resolutions for each meeting; in addition, there should not be guest speeches, flower presentations, and flag presentations at every meeting, and representatives should not be sent off with bands. We should get rid of these old shackles and formalism that hinder our close contact with the masses. Speeches should get straight to the point, and we must focus on solving the problems that the masses are currently urgently concerned about (such as how to carry out the new record movement, how to sign collective labor-management contracts, how to solve unemployment and employment, and issues such as real estate, rent, taxation, public security, education, cooperatives, wages, municipal administration, etc.). Of course, these problems cannot all be solved in one meeting, but as long as we plan and prepare, they can be solved in several meetings. For any problem to be solved, the representatives must first allow the masses they represent to deliberate on it, and let the masses express their opinions and put forward proposals. If it is found that the government's original agenda does not meet the requirements of the majority of the masses, it can be revised according to the requirements of the majority of the masses, and the masses cannot be forced to accept their own subjectively prepared set. For the problems that the government and the masses have both thoroughly deliberated, we should seize one or two problems with universality, fully prepare them, and solve them one by one with determination. Secondly, we must lead well when the meeting is held; the key to good leadership is, first, to clearly raise the issues, fully promote democracy, and earnestly discuss; second, to grasp the policy of the people's democratic united front and carefully analyze class dynamics. For example, in this People's Representative Conference in various regions, the working class was able to appreciate its leading position and unite the peasants, students, freelancers, and capitalists; and after the capitalists signed the collective contract, they also invested in expanding production, improving the enthusiasm for operation, and at the same time, they also reflected their different demands, as well as some nostalgia for the past unreasonable system. Therefore, we must oppose both closed-doorism and undemocratic styles, and oppose unprincipled accommodation. Again, there should be concise and specific resolutions, and they should be organized well for communication and conscientiously implemented. This is a sign of whether the People's Representative Conference is "top-notch" and whether it is loyal to the people.

In conclusion, Chairman Gao Gang pointed out two points: (1) In the future, large cities and provinces should establish consultation committees, which should not be too large in number, but should include representatives from all aspects, so that they can consult on various issues during the adjournment of the representative conference. (2) After each meeting, we must sum up the successful experiences and failed experiences, the dynamics of various classes, and what problems have been solved. As long as we overcome blindness, we will definitely be able to hold the People's Representative Conferences well.

　　东北十一个市县长会议上
  　高岗总结各地人民代表会经验
    【新华社沈阳二十七日电】东北人民政府于日前召集沈阳、哈尔滨、长春、吉林、本溪、抚顺、鞍山、大连、锦州、铁岭、辽阳十一个市县的市长与县长开会，研究和总结各城市第一次人民代表会议的经验，以为各地即将召开的第二次人民代表会议所取法。会议由高岗主席、林枫副主席亲自主持，历时三日，最后一天由高岗主席做总结。高主席在总结中首先对各城市人民代表会议的成绩作了一个总的估计，他说：截至现在为止，东北三万人口以上的城市，已有六十三个开过人民代表会议。这些会议以工人阶级和其他劳动人民为主体，团结了小资产阶级、民族资产阶级与各界民主人士，解决了一些群众当前迫切要求解决的问题，比较显著的如签订劳资集体合同，确定房租，以及解决了卫生、水电等市政问题。特别是劳资集体合同的签订，使劳资两利政策具体化了，劳资双方都提高了生产积极性，这是目前解决劳资关系的最好办法，各地尚未签订劳资合同的，应即速签订。此外，若干代表会议上，向政府提出了很多宝贵的意见和善意的批评，对改进政府工作极有帮助，证明了这种代表会议是反对官僚主义、使政府进一步联系群众并发动群众积极性的一个最好方式，也是人民政权的基本组织形式。但是也有不少会议开得马虎，有些形式主义，企图解决的问题太多，结果什么问题也不能解决。或者做了很多决议（如松江某县做了一百零三条决议），而有些决议则不是目前所能办到的（如提出农业机械化等），因此人民不感兴趣，政府也难兑现，这是脱离群众的做法，必须改变。
    其次，高岗主席纠正了对人民代表会议的某些认识上的偏差。他说，现在还有一些人不了解人民代表会议的重要意义，认为这是为完成上级任务、奉命而开的一种临时性的集会；或者认为是旧的参议会、“半干部会”等等。产生这些错误认识的基本原因就是不了解人民代表会议是人民行使自己的权力，解决人民当前问题的会议；是政府解决各项问题的一种最好的形式。他指出：不少干部习惯于过去通过干部会议等来传达政策，以及通过区政府、街政府等来解决问题；而不习惯召开人民代表会议，由各民主阶层中代表共同协商讨论，决定政府的工作方针和办法，及解决群众迫切需要解决的问题。这是我们当前的一个困难；一定要打破这个困难，才能把人民代表会议开好。事实证明，若干城市经过这次人民代表会议，使政策与群众见面后，我们就真正生动活泼地了解了各阶层的动态，政策也就变成了广大人民行动的方向。
    高岗主席继指出，为了使会议能很好地反映群众意见，人民代表应基本上按产业与行业选举，决不能以街道为基本单位选举。少数没有一定行业的，可由政府聘请若干代表（如每区一个）。对于少数极为贫困，误不起工的代表，应由其所代表的行业或工会，给予相等于一般工人的工资津贴。这次会议中某些城市机关部队的代表比例较大，今后这种代表的比例应该减少，除了按一定比例被选为代表者外，其他人员因工作关系需要参加，可采取列席办法。某些城市私营工商业代表多过职工代表，某些城市公营企业代表过多，少数地区共产党员代表过多，都应在下次开会时作适当调整。各地应逐步地吸收好的代表，不好的代表群众可以随时撤换，以使代表会的组织逐渐趋于完善。必须注意代表的广泛性，但亦不应凑数。人民代表会议是经常性的组织与制度，是政权基本组织形式，应该一月至两月开会一次，一般地每次一天，少则半天，最多两天；无事可不开，但决不能超过两个月不开。会议每次都要抓住中心，解决一两个当前群众迫切要求解决的具体问题。问题太多或太空泛，就一定解决不好。同时应使代表会议所要解决的问题，与政府日常工作密切联系起来，才不会经常为开会而突击、乱忙或耽误工作。
    最后，高岗主席指示大家今后如何开好人民代表会议，他说，中心的问题在于要有充分的准备。市长县长和政府方面要准备好施政报告或工作报告或工作总结，但这些报告或总结都不要是长篇大论、包罗万象、冗长空泛；会议事先要准备好必须解决的问题的决议草案，但每次会议的决议不要太多；此外，也不要每次会议都有来宾致词，献花献旗，用乐队送代表，更不要包办酒席、请客吃饭、应该去掉这些陈旧的束缚与阻碍我们与群众密切联系的一套形式主义。讲话要开门见山，要抓紧解决目前群众迫切关心的问题（如关于如何开展新纪录运动，如何签订劳资集体合同，如何解决失业与就业，以及房产、房租、税收、治安、教育、合作社、工薪、市政等等问题）。当然这些问题不可能在一个会上全部解决，但只要有计划有准备地去做，几次会议就可解决的。凡要解决的问题，必须首先让代表提到其所代表的群众中酝酿，让群众发表意见与提出议案。如发现政府原定议题不合大多数群众要求时，可以根据大多数群众的要求修改，不能强迫群众接受自己主观准备的一套。而对于政府与群众均已酝酿成熟的问题，则抓住一两个带普遍性的问题，加以充分准备，有决心地一个一个地解决。其次，在开会时，要领导得好；领导好的关键，第一就是明确地提出问题，充分发扬民主，认真讨论；第二要掌握人民民主统一战线政策，仔细分析阶级动态。例如此次各地人民代表会议中，工人阶级能体会到自己的领导地位，团结了农民、学生、自由职业者与资本家；而资本家签订集体合同后，也纷纷投资扩大生产，提高了经营的积极性，同时会上也反映了他们不同的要求，以及对过去不合理制度的某些留恋。因之，既要反对关门主义与不民主的作风，又要反对无原则的迁就。再次，要有简明具体的决议，并要分别组织很好的传达，认真贯彻地执行。这是人民群众测验代表会议是否“顶事”，是否忠实于人民群众的标志。
    在结语中，高岗主席指出两点：（一）今后大的城市与省一级应成立协商委员会，人数不要太多，但应包括各方面代表，以便在代表会议闭会期间协商各项问题。（二）以后每次会议，都要很好地总结一下成功的经验与失败的经验，各阶级的动态如何，解决了些什么问题。只要我们克服了盲目性，就一定能开好人民代表会议。
