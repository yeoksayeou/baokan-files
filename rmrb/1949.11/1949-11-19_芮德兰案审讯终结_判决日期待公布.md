　　Redland Case Trial Concludes
  　Verdict Date to be Announced
    [Beijing News] The Beijing People's Court held a session at 9:30 AM yesterday (the 18th) to try the case of Redland, an English teacher from Chongde Middle School of British nationality, for insulting and spitting on students, and insulting the Chinese people. More than one hundred people from various organizations and students from Yenching University and Fu Jen Catholic University attended the hearing. The plaintiffs Lu Zuyi and four others, as well as the plaintiffs' representatives Zhou Luoliang and Tan Sijin, the defendant Redland, witnesses Zhao Xianguang and four others, and Song Zhensui and worker Wang Xichun, alumni of the school who participated in the Redland condemnation meeting, were all present. After the opening of the court, Judge He Zhanjun first reported on the investigation conducted by the court after accepting the case. Then, the plaintiff's representative Zhou Luoliang stated the course of the incident and the reasons for the accusation. Next, the insulted students Tan Yu, Li Shaokang, Tang Lun, and Bai Lianji reported the details of being spat upon and insulted. Witnesses Zhao Xianguang, Li Kesheng, Ma Linqing, and Yang Sen testified that what the above four people said was true. After a ten-minute break, the defendant Redland described the situation of that day. Redland still attempted to evade the facts of insulting students and publicly insulting the Chinese people with words such as "can't remember very well" and "it's a small matter, it will be forgotten." He tried his best to cover up his consistent imperialist barbaric behavior of insulting students and beating Wang Junquan, the child of a worker at the school, and mistreating students two years ago by saying he had a "bad temper." The plaintiff's representative exposed them one by one. The trial concluded at twelve o'clock. The verdict date will be announced separately.
