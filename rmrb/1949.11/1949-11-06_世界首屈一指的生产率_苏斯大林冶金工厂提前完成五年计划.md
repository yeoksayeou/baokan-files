Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 5th: TASS Moscow News: Amidst the socialist competition among the Soviet working people to welcome the October Revolution Day, the largest metallurgical plant in the Soviet Union, the Stalin Metallurgical Plant in Kuznetsk District, has completed its Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. The world's largest hydroelectric power station, the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station, also completed its annual power generation plan for this year ahead of schedule on October 26th.

Pravda published a full-page report on the news and articles about the Stalin Metallurgical Plant in the vast Kuznetsk District (in western Siberia, southeast of Novosibirsk) completing the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. The plant's director, Beran, wrote in an article: At the beginning of last year, the plant's employees wrote to Comrade Stalin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, guaranteeing to achieve the five-year plan's output of steel and rolled metal in four years, and the output of pig iron in four and a half years. The employees' intense construction work has produced brilliant results. The increase in the output of pig iron, steel, and rolled metal now greatly exceeds the goals of the Five-Year Plan. Kuznetsk metallurgical workers were able to complete the five-year plan for steel and rolled metal in just three years. In the nine months of 1949, the average daily output of steel and rolled metal exceeded the planned average daily output for 1950 by 10%. The five-year plan for pig iron was completed in three and a half years. It is expected that this year's output will exceed the planned output for the final year of the Five-Year Plan by 9.5%. Kuznetsk workers have made many improvements in production. During these five-year plan years, the factory adopted more than 4,500 rationalization proposals. This has saved millions of rubles annually. This year, the labor productivity of Kuznetsk workers has increased by 38% compared to 1946, while the blast furnace department has increased by 48%. In the three years and nine months of this Five-Year Plan, the achievement in reducing production costs exceeded the original figure, saving 100 million rubles.

　　世界首屈一指的生产率
  　苏斯大林冶金工厂提前完成五年计划
    【新华社北京五日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：在苏联劳动人民为迎接十月革命节而进行的社会主义竞赛热潮中，全苏最大的冶金工厂——库兹涅茨克区的斯大林冶金工厂已提前完成了五年计划，全世界最大的水电站——第聂伯水电站也在十月二十六日提前完成了今年全年的产电计划。
    真理报以整版篇幅刊载关于庞大的库兹涅茨克区（在西伯利亚西部，新西伯利亚城的东南）斯大林冶金工厂提前完成五年计划的消息和文章。该厂厂长贝兰在一篇文章里写道：去年年初，该厂员工上书苏联部长会议主席斯大林时，曾保证四年达成五年计划的钢与辗金属的产量，并在四年半达成铣铁的产量。员工们紧张的建设工作，已产生了辉煌的效果。铣铁、钢与辗金属产量的增加，现在就已大大超过了五年计划的目标。库兹涅茨克冶金工人竟能在三年之内，就完成了钢与辗金属的五年计划。在一九四九年的九个月里，每日钢与辗金属的平均产量已超过计划中所规定的一九五○年每日平均产量的百分之十。铣铁的五年计划，三年半就完成了。预料今年产量将超过五年计划最后一年计划的百分之九点五。库兹涅茨克的工人在生产上有许多改进。在这次五年计划的年月中，工厂采用了四千五百多个合理化建议。这就使每年节省了千百万卢布。今年库兹涅茨克工人的劳动生产率和一九四六年相比，增加了百分之三十八，而鼓风炉部则增加了百分之四十八。在这次五年计划的三年零九个月中，生产成本的减低的成绩超出了原定的数字，节省了一亿卢布。
