Xinhua News Agency, Southwest Front, 16th: Before embarking on the advance into the Southwest, the People's Liberation Army's Second Field Army held solemn oath-taking rallies in their respective garrisons in Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangsu. At these rallies, the commanders and fighters of the Second Field Army were in high spirits, and letters of request for battle and resolutions poured onto the platform from various companies, platoons, and squads. The soldiers all strived to earn great merits in this great advance. At the oath-taking rally of a certain army held at the foot of Jinggang Mountain in Jiangxi, various American-made light and heavy weapons shone with the light of victory. Beside the rostrum, a large red flag presented two years ago by the six million people of Taihang when the army was upgraded from local armed forces to a field army and crossed the Yellow River on a southern expedition, hung high. On it were written the fourteen striking characters "Taihang sons and daughters bring long tassels, cross the river south to bind the azure dragon," demonstrating the infinite glory of the people's army rapidly growing stronger and moving from victory to greater victory.

At the oath-taking rally of another army, General Zhou Xihan, the army commander, announced in his speech: "We held our first oath-taking rally to cross the Yellow River and, together with the People's Liberation Army, reversed the war situation; the second oath-taking rally was to cross the Yangtze River and, in coordination with fraternal units, liberate the vast lands south of the Yangtze River. Today, the third oath-taking is to liberate the Great Southwest, thoroughly annihilate the remaining Kuomintang forces, and liberate all of China." His words aroused enthusiastic applause and slogans from the entire audience.

The people of Xiang and Gan provinces, which were old Soviet areas during the land revolution, excitedly traveled from villages dozens of miles away to participate in these historically significant rallies. An 82-year-old blind farmer, Feng Chunlin, had someone help him push through the cheering crowd to the parade of artillery vehicles, stroking the cannons and excitedly saying, "More than twenty years ago, when Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu were in Jinggang Mountain, the Red Army had only a few hundred people and couldn't even see cannons. Today, it has become so powerful." During the meeting, the families of Red Army soldiers, wearing large red flowers, sat in the front row, and the resolutions of the PLA commanders and fighters requesting an early advance filled the meeting place. The people of the old Soviet areas and the families of Red Army soldiers spoke out one after another at the meeting, recounting the atrocities of the Kuomintang bandit troops who killed their children and fathers, burned houses, and seized land, demanding that the PLA quickly annihilate the Kuomintang bandit troops. Mr. Wang, a ninety-year-old man with all white hair, spoke on behalf of the families. His son, who had served as the chairman of the county soviet, was killed by the bandit troops. He excitedly shouted: "Comrades, march to the Southwest! Eliminate the enemy and avenge the people!"

The commanders and fighters of a certain unit swore at the meeting: "In order to liberate the 90 million people of the Southwest and build the Southwest's national defense, we are not afraid of long distances and high mountains, not afraid of heavy rivers, not afraid of hardship and fatigue, we must advance quickly." The commanders and fighters of a certain unit swore an oath before the images of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu and the military flag at the oath-taking rally, determined to thoroughly eliminate the remnants of the enemy and plant the red flag all over the Great Southwest, up to the borders of Guangxi and Yunnan in the motherland. The resolution of the commanders and fighters of that unit put forward the slogan: "Saying is not enough, whether it's steel or iron, see it in the Southwest!" The artillery units of that unit guaranteed to overcome all difficulties, not be afraid of climbing mountains and wading through rivers, and complete the advance mission; the engineering units stated that they would ensure that highways would be built to the Great Southwest.

Zhang Yingcai, a representative of a certain army to the World Youth Congress, launched a heated campaign to advance, annihilate the enemy, and earn merit in the "Iron and Steel Battalion." The Hou Yongfu squad, famous for its heroic lone missions, set a plan to resolutely complete combat missions, and to take advantage of the gaps in the advance to study hard and improve their culture. The combat hero Ma Shao, who attended the First National Youth Congress, was sick in the hospital. Upon hearing about the oath-taking, he resolutely requested to be discharged from the hospital and return to his unit.

Logistics departments, supply and hygiene personnel, and administrative staff all formulated their own merit-making plans. The female comrades in various positions also guaranteed to resolutely keep up with the team and complete the advance mission.

　　解放西南彻底消灭残匪
  　二野各部庄严誓师
  　热烈掀起进军立功运动
    【新华社西南前线十六日电】进军西南的人民解放军第二野战军，在此次出动前，曾分别在江西、浙江、安徽、江苏驻地举行庄严的誓师大会。在大会上，第二野战军各部的指战员们士气旺盛，请战书、决心书象雪片似的从各连排班中送到主席台上。战士们都争取要在这次大进军中建立大功。某军在江西井岗山下召开进军誓师大会的会场上，各种美械的轻重武的闪耀着胜利的光辉。主席台旁，高悬两年前该军由地方武装升级野战军渡河南征时，太行六百万人民赠献的大红旗，上面写着“太行子弟带长缨，跨河南征缚苍龙”十四个鲜明的大字，显示出人民军队迅速壮大从胜利走向更大胜利的无限光荣。
    另一个军的誓师大会上，军长周希汉将军讲话宣布说：“我们开第一次誓师大会打过黄河，和全国人民解放军一起扭转了战争局面；第二次誓师大会打过长江，协同兄弟部队解放了江南广大土地。今天第三次誓师要解放大西南，彻底歼灭残余国民党势力，解放全中国。”他的话激起了全场热烈的掌声和口号声。
    土地革命时代曾是老苏区的湘赣人民，从十数里外的乡村兴奋地赶来参加这些富有历史意义的大会。一位八十二岁的双目失明的老农民冯春霖，让人扶着从欢呼的人群中挤到游行的炮车前，抚摸着大炮激动地说：“二十多年前毛主席朱总司令在井岗山的时候，红军只有几百人，连炮也看不到，今天变成这样强大了。”开会时，红军家属带着大红花坐在最前面，解放军指战员请求提前进军的决心书挂满会场。老苏区人民和红军家属在会上纷纷诉说国民党匪军杀死了他们的孩子和父亲、烧了房屋、夺去了土地等等暴行，要求解放军赶快去歼灭国民党匪军。须发全白九十岁的王老先生代表家属讲话，他的当过县苏维埃主席的儿子被匪军杀了，他激奋地喊：“同志们，向西南进军吧！消灭敌人给人民报仇！”
    某部指战员在会上宣誓说：“为了解放西南九千万人民，建设西南国防，我们不怕路远山高，不怕河水重重，不怕艰苦疲劳，我们要赶快进军。”某部指战员在誓师大会上在毛主席、朱总司令像和军旗前宣誓，决心彻底消灭残敌，把红旗插遍大西南，插到广西、云南祖国的边疆上。该部指战员的决心书上，提出了：“光说不算，是钢是铁到西南看！”的口号。该部炮兵部队保证克服一切困难，不怕翻山涉水，完成进军任务；工兵部队表示保证把公路修到大西南。
    某军出席世界青年大会代表张英才的“钢铁营”，掀起热烈的进军歼敌立功运动。著名孤胆英雄侯永福班定计划坚决完成战斗任务，并要利用进军空隙努力学习，提高文化。出席第一次全国青代大会的战斗英雄马绍生病在医院，听说誓师，坚决要求出院归队。
    后勤部门、供给卫生人员，事务人员都订了自己的立功计划。各个岗位上的女同志，也保证坚决跟上队伍，完成进军任务。
