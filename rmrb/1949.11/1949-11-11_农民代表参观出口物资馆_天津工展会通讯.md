    Farmer Representatives Visit Export Goods Hall
    A dispatch from the Tianjin Industrial Exhibition
    Kang Weizhong

    In the Export Goods Hall of the Tianjin Industrial Exhibition, farmer representatives discovered many new things. They learned that so many things that were once neglected or discarded could be exported to earn foreign exchange.

    The hall was filled with various mountain goods and medicinal materials, including melon seeds, almonds, peanuts, walnuts, peppercorns, saposhnikovia divaricata, licorice, persimmons, red dates, and more. These products come from many regions of our country. In order to make the new China economically independent and self-reliant, the People's Government, in accordance with the "reward exports, limit imports" foreign trade policy, has begun to organize large-scale exports under the unified leadership and planning of the North China Native Produce Company. According to customs statistics from March to August alone, 6,962 quintals of black dates, 2,814 quintals of red dates, 24,990 quintals of mung beans, and 3,275 quintals of licorice were exported. The export volume of other native products was also considerable. After seeing these things, Liu Jinlong, of the Jingjing County Construction Section of the Shijiazhuang Prefecture, said: "Jingjing County can produce 3 million catties of medicinal materials a year, but no one buys them, and many are burned. Last year, more than 900,000 catties of medicinal materials were burned. If we knew they could be exported, we would have saved them for export no matter how difficult it was!"

    When a group of farmer representatives clustered around the carpet exhibits woven with various beautiful patterns, they praised the wisdom and genius of the city workers. Wang Decai, a labor hero from Qingyuan County, said: "We farmers should learn from the workers! We should go back and promote the idea that the rural areas should supply large quantities of wool to the cities, so that more carpet products can be exported in exchange for goods." Carpets are a specialty of Beijing and Tianjin. After liberation, with the support of the People's Government, the output and export volume have increased compared to the past, as can be clearly seen from the wall charts. The export of Tianjin women's work carpets in 1948 was 1,832,120 square feet. From March to September after liberation, the export volume was 2,823,688 square feet. The export volume in less than half a year after liberation exceeded the total export volume of 990,568 square feet in 1948 under the rule of the Kuomintang. This is a miracle. The farmers were very happy listening to the explanation of the narrator.

    The pig bristles displayed in the hall also attracted the most attention from the farmers. Pig bristles are abundant in Baoding, Zhangjiakou, Baotou, and the Northeast. When Liu Lizhi, a farmer representative from Baoding Prefecture, enthusiastically admired this product, he said: "Pig bristles are wasted too much in our area. People don't cherish pig bristles when they slaughter pigs. When I go back, I will promote the idea that we should strive to transport more to Tianjin for large-scale export." The person in charge of the pig bristle company told reporters that the company has currently received about 5 million catties of raw pig bristles, which can be processed into 3.4 million catties of finished products. Recently, 1.65 million catties have been exported. He said: Some rural areas abandon pig bristles, which is a pity. This visit by farmers will definitely help to acquire more pig bristles for export in the future.

    There are also many agricultural products that can be exported, such as beans, peanuts, potatoes, and onions, and even chicken feathers and goose down are important export materials. The farmer representatives recognized and discovered that chicken feathers were considered waste in the countryside in the past, but they are useful things when transported to the city.

    In order to strengthen the connection between industry and agriculture and promote the smooth development of urban and rural trade, the Tianjin Chamber of Commerce invited farmer representatives from ten prefectures in Hebei Province to a forum on the evening of the 5th. At this meeting, the farmers put forward many valuable opinions. They gave detailed introductions to the general situation of local products in various places. Cangxian Prefecture produces red dates, pears, black beans, and straw braid; Tangshan Prefecture is rich in coal, pig bristles, cotton, and peanuts; Tianjin County produces jute and mats. These are all urgently needed by the city for purchase. The person in charge of the Chamber of Commerce was extremely happy to obtain these valuable materials. Wang Zhizhou, manager of the private Hengtong Export Company, said: "I only learned today that Linyu County also produces walnuts. There is a shortage of walnut kernels abroad, but there are no sales in the market. We should quickly send someone to purchase them."

    农民代表参观出口物资馆
    天津工展会通讯
    康伟中
    农民代表们在天津工展会的出口物资馆里，发现了许多新事情，原来这么多过去不重视或丢掉的东西，都能出口，换取外汇。
    馆内摆满了各种山货药材，有瓜子、杏仁、花生米、胡桃、花椒、防风、甘草、柿子、红枣等。这些东西产自我国许多区域。人民政府为了使新中国在经济上能独立自主，根据了“奖出限入”的对外贸易政策，在华北土产公司的统一领导与计划下，已经开始大量组织出口。仅据三月至八月份海关的统计，黑枣计出口六千九百六十二公担，红枣有二千八百一十四公担，绿豆二万四千九百九十公担，甘草三千二百七十五公担，其他土产出口数量亦很可观。看了这些情形，石家庄专署井径县建设科刘金龙说：“井径县全年能产药材三百万斤，没有人去收买，烧掉的很多。去年烧掉的就有九十余万斤药材。如果知道能出口，再困难也要保存起来出口啊！”
    当一群农民代表簇拥在编织着各色美丽花纹的地毯展品之前，他们盛赞着城市工人创造的智慧与天才。清苑县劳动英雄王德才说：“我们农民该向工人看齐啊！回去应当好好宣传，使农村的羊毛大量地供应城市，以便使更多的地毯成品出口，换回东西。”地毯是北京、天津的特产，解放后在人民政府的扶植下，产量与出口量较过去都有增加；从墙上的挂图显然地可以看出。天津女工地毯在一九四八年出口为一、八三二、一二○方英尺，解放后的三月至九月出口为二、八二三、六八八方英尺。解放后不及半年的出口量，即超过了国民党统治时期的一九四八年全年的出口量九九○、五六八方英尺。这是个奇迹。农民们听着说明员的解释，都非常高兴。
    馆里陈列着的猪鬃也是最吸引农民注意的。猪鬃盛产于保定、张家口、包头及东北各地。当保定专署的农民代表刘立之兴致勃勃地欣赏这种东西时，他说：“猪鬃在我们那里糟蹋得太多了，人们杀了猪对猪鬃都不爱惜；回去我要向他们宣传，争取能多运到天津，大量出口。”猪鬃公司的负责人对记者说，该公司目前已收到猪鬃原料约五百万斤，加工后可制成品三百四十万斤。最近已出口一百六十五万斤。他说：有些农村把猪鬃都抛弃了，这很可惜；这次农民参观，一定有助于将来更多的收购猪鬃出口。
    还有不少农产品，如豆子、花生、土豆、洋葱都能出口，甚至鸡毛、鹅绒……也是出口的重要物资。农民代表们认识了，发现了，象鸡毛过去在农村是废物，运到城市都是有用的东西。
    为了加强工农业的联系，沟通城乡贸易的顺畅开展，津市商会五日晚邀请河北省十个专署的农民代表座谈。在这个会上，农民们提出了许多宝贵的意见。他们曾经详细地介绍了各地土产的概况。沧县专区产红枣、梨、黑豆、草帽辫；唐山专区盛产煤、猪鬃、棉花、花生；天津县产麻、席……这些都急待城市收购。商会的负责人获得了这些宝贵的材料，异常高兴。私营亨通出口行经理王芷舟说：“我今天才知道临榆县也产胡桃，国外胡桃仁很缺，但市上又没有卖的，我们当很快地派专人去收购。”
