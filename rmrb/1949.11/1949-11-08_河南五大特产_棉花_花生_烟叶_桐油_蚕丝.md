Henan's Five Major Specialty Products
　　Cotton, Peanuts, Tobacco, Tung Oil, Silk
　　Henan's economy is mainly agricultural. The rural areas produce large quantities of cotton, peanuts, tobacco, tung oil, and silk. These specialty products are major industrial raw materials. If they can continuously supply urban industries, they will promote the development of industries such as textiles, oil pressing, and cigarette manufacturing. In the past, these raw materials were the targets of imperialist plunder, and most of them were exported. After the Kuomintang reactionaries launched the civil war, foreign contacts were severed, and production shrank. After liberation, thanks to the active support of the People's Government and the large-scale purchase of local products, the past state of depression has gradually changed.
　　Henan's five major specialty products are as follows:
　　Cotton: The geological climate of the cotton-producing areas is suitable, and the cotton production area is as large as 2.8 million mu. In the six counties west of Shanzhou on the south bank of the Yellow River, such as Lingbao and Wenxiang, cotton planting is the main production for farmers, and the cotton quality is the best, with fine and long fibers. In addition, there are 13 counties such as Nanyang and Dengxian, where cotton production is also very abundant. The annual output of the above areas is about 93 million jin, and it is mostly transported to Xi'an, Tianjin, Hankou, and Shanghai, with Zhengzhou as the center.
　　Peanuts: The middle reaches of the Yellow River from Zhengzhou to Shangqiu, a distance of more than 300 li, are peanut-producing areas, with the area around Kaifeng as the central area. Due to changes in the river course, most of the area is composed of bluish-sandy soil, which is most suitable for planting peanuts. During the Japanese occupation, the enemy bought at low prices, and the farmers suffered too much, reducing the province's producing area to 2.34 million mu. During the Kuomintang rule, heavy taxes and levies further reduced the producing area to 833,000 mu. After liberation, the government advocated oil production, banks provided loans and assistance, and trade companies purchased peanut oil in large quantities, leading to a resurgence in production. This year, a survey of only ten counties including Kaifeng and Tongxu shows that 939,800 mu of peanuts were planted, which can produce 100 million jin of peanuts.
　　Tobacco: Henan, around 32 degrees north latitude, is an important tobacco-producing area. The climate is warm and dry, and the soil contains a large amount of phosphorus, potassium, and calcium, which is suitable for tobacco growth. The quality is excellent and famous at home and abroad. The entire producing area is distributed in more than ten counties such as Xiangxian, Xuchang, and Dengxian, with a tobacco planting area of ​​658,000 mu and an annual output of about 78.8186 million jin. The quality of Xiangxian is the best, with thick and large leaves, rich in oil, and a clear, mellow, and pure taste. Xuchang and Dengxian are second. In the past, it was sold well in Shanghai, Hankou, and Southeast Asia, but later, due to the planned price reduction by British and American imperialist tobacco companies, the income of farmers was not as good as that of other agricultural products. After liberation, the government vigorously supported it, and established the Dafeng Tobacco Company in Xuchang to open up foreign sales channels.
　　Tung Oil: Tung oil is also a major export from Henan. The western Henan area near Shaanxi is the main producing area, with Xixiakou, Nanzhao, and Xiping being the most important. According to a survey in Xixiakou, the annual output is about 300,000 jin. At the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War, the Kuomintang government prohibited the export of tung oil, implemented unified purchase and sales, forbade farmers to trade freely, and wantonly felled tung trees, resulting in a declining output. After liberation, although the government called for the restoration of tung oil production, due to the severe damage and the failure to eliminate local bandits who often harassed and blocked traffic, it failed to recover quickly.
　　Silk: Silk production can be divided into three regions: (1) Shangzhe Silk Region: including 14 counties such as Shangshui, Shenqiu, Shangqiu, Zhecheng, and Huaiyang, with an annual cocoon production of about 10,000 dan, accounting for a quarter of the province's output. The annual raw silk production is about 1,000 dan. (2) Wannan Silk Region: including more than ten counties such as Nanyang and Zhenping, with an annual output of 14,600 dan, accounting for one-third of the province's output. The cocoon quality in this region is better, with an annual raw silk production of about 134,000 jin, with half yellow silk and half white silk. (3) Huangguang Silk Region: including more than ten counties such as Runan, Xinyang, Huangchuan, Guangshan, and Gushi, with an annual raw silk production of 95,000 jin, accounting for a quarter of the province's output. In addition, the production of tussah silk is also very rich. The main producing areas are Lushan, Nanzhao, Songxian, Zhenping, and Neixiang counties in the Funiu Mountains. According to statistics in the 36th year of the Republic (1947), the annual production of cocoons was 69,000 dan, which can produce 348,000 jin of silk. In total, the above regions can produce 280,000 bolts of silk per year.

　　河南五大特产
  　棉花　花生　烟叶　桐油　蚕丝
    河南经济主要为农业经济。农村中生产着大批的棉花、花生、烟叶、桐油、蚕丝，这些特产都是工业主要原料，如能源源供给城市工业，将促进纺织、榨油、卷烟等工业的发展。过去这些原料是帝国主义掠夺的对象，大部向外输出。国民党反动派发动内战后，对外联络断绝，产量缩减。解放后，由于人民政府积极扶助和大量收购土产，已逐渐转变了过去的萧条状态。
    河南五大特产如下：
    棉花：产棉区地质气候适宜，棉产多至二百八十万亩。陕州以西黄河南岸灵宝、阌乡等六个县，植棉是农民的主要生产，棉质最好，纤维细长。另外还有南阳、邓县等十三县，棉产亦很丰富。以上各区产额年约九千三百余万斤，以郑州为中心，多运往西安、天津、汉口、上海。
    花生：自郑州至商邱三百余里的黄河中流为花生产区，以开封一带为中心区。该地区因河道变化，大部均系青沙土壤，最宜种植花生。日寇侵占时期敌人低价收买，农民过于吃亏，全省产地缩小至二百三十四万亩。国民党统治时期，横征暴敛，产地又降至八十三万三千余亩。解放后政府提倡榨油生产，银行贷款扶助，贸易公司大量收购花生油，生产又有起色。今年仅开封、通许等十县调查，种植花生九十三万九千八百余亩，可产花生一万万斤。
    烟叶：河南北纬三十二度左右是重要产烟区，气候温暖高燥，土质含多量磷、钾、钙三要素，宜于烟草生长，品质优良，名驰中外。整个产区分布于襄县、许昌、邓县等十余个县，植烟面积达六十五万八千余亩，年产约七千八百十八万六千余斤，质量以襄县最佳，叶片厚而大，富油质，味清高醇正，许昌、邓县次之。过去盛销沪、汉、南洋等地，后因英美帝国主义烟草公司有计划地压低烟价，农民所得反不如其他农产品。解放后政府大力扶植，并在许昌成立大丰烟草公司，打开对外销路。
    桐油：桐油也是河南出口大宗，豫西接近陕西地区为主要产区，以西峡口、南召、西坪为最。据西峡口一地调查，年产约三十万斤。抗战开始，国民党政府禁止桐油出口，实行统购统销，不准农民自由买卖，加以恣意砍伐桐树，产量日益下落。解放后，政府虽经号召恢复桐油生产，因受摧残太甚，地方土匪未能清除，经常出扰，交通受阻，未能很快恢复。
    蚕丝：蚕丝的出产可分为三个区域：（１）商柘蚕区：包括商水、沈邱、商邱、柘城、淮阳等十四县，每年产茧约一万担左右，占全省产量四分之一。年出生丝约千担左右。（２）宛南蚕区：包括南阳、镇平等十余县，年产一万四千六百担，占全省产额三分之一，本区茧质较好，年出生丝约十三万四千余市斤，黄白丝各一半。（３）潢光蚕区：包括汝南、信阳、潢川、光山、固始等十余县，年产生丝九万五千斤，占全省产量四分之一。此外，柞蚕丝产量也很丰富，伏牛山脉中之鲁山、南召、嵩县、镇平、内乡等县为主要产地。据三十六年统计，年产茧六万九千担，可缫丝三十四万八千余斤。共计以上各区，每年可产绸二十八万匹。
