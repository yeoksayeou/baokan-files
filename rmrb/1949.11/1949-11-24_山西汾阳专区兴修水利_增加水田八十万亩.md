　　Shanxi Fenyang Special District Constructs Water Conservancy Projects
　　Increases Paddy Fields by 800,000 Mu
    [Reported by this newspaper] The Fenyang Special District in Shanxi Province is mostly flatlands. This year, with the strong support of the government, it has restored and newly added 813,651 mu of paddy fields, accounting for 23.4 percent of the total cultivated area. The district has the Fen River, Xiao River, Xiangyu River, Wuma River, Qing River, Wenyu River, and Guoyi River intersecting within its borders, which are excellent conditions for the district to carry out water conservancy construction. According to last year's statistics, the above-mentioned areas could irrigate 501,275 mu of land. In February of this year, the former Jinzhong Administrative Office, under the policy of "constructing water conservancy projects and increasing production," required the Fenyang Special District to complete 630,000 mu of irrigation this year. In addition to issuing 4.7 million yuan in flood prevention loans, the People's Government also provided 26,379,975 yuan in water conservancy loans, solving the financial difficulties of purchasing various equipment for water conservancy projects. Throughout the year, 28 river courses, 77 canals, and 55 canal gates were repaired; 40 new canals and 25 canal gates were opened; 14 bridges were built; and 297 water wells such as waterwheels, windlasses, and derricks were repaired and newly built. In terms of flood prevention, there were 123 large and small emergency rescue projects; the irrigation area of 813,651 mu was successfully completed, greatly exceeding the original plan. Currently, 528 villages have benefited from water conservancy, which has played a significant role in this year's increased production.

　　增加水田八十万亩
    【本报讯】山西省汾阳专区大部是平原地带，今年在政府大力扶助下，已恢复与新增八十一万三千六百五十一亩水田，占耕地总面积的百分之二十三点四。该区境内有汾河、潇河、嶑峪、乌马、清水、文峪、虢义等河纵横交流，是本区开展水利建设极好的条件。据去年的统计，上述地区可以灌溉田地五十万零一千二百七十五亩。今年二月原晋中行署在“兴修水利，增加生产”的方针下，要求汾阳专区本年完成六十三万亩的灌溉任务。人民政府除发放防汛贷款四百七十万元外，又贷给水利贷款二千六百三十七万九千九百七十五元，解决了购买兴修水利工程上各种器材的经济困难。计全年整修河道二十八条，渠道七十七条，渠闸五十五个；新开渠道四十条，渠闸二十五个；建筑桥梁十四座；整修与新建水车、辘辘、吊杆等水井二百九十七眼。在防汛上，大小抢险工程一百二十三处；胜利的完成了八十一万三千六百五十一亩的灌溉面积，大大的超过了原订计划。现已有五百二十八个村庄得到水利的益处，且在本年的增产上起了重大作用。
