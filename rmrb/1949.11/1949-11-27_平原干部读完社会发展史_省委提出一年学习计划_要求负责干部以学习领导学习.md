Plain Cadres Finish Studying "History of Social Development"
　　Provincial Party Committee Proposes One-Year Study Plan
    Requiring Responsible Cadres to Lead Learning Through Study
[Plain News] After the general cadres in the province finished studying "History of Social Development," the Propaganda Department of the Pingyuan Provincial Party Committee recently issued instructions on a one-year study plan for cadres in service. The regulations stipulate: (1) In the coming year, all cadres with reading ability, theoretical level, and practical struggle experience (who can be divided into groups A and B according to different levels) should continue to study the five books: "Political Economy," "The Communist Manifesto," "Socialism: Utopian and Scientific," "Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism," and "The State and Revolution." Those without reading ability and lacking theoretical knowledge should be compiled into Group C and taught "Basic Problems of the Chinese Revolution," "History of Social Development," and Xue Muqiao's "Political Economy." This winter, Group A is required to finish studying Leontief's "Political Economy"; Group B should finish studying Xue Muqiao's "Political Economy"; areas, cities, and counties that have studied political economy but have not studied the basic problems of the Chinese Revolution should still conduct studies of "'The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party,' 'On New Democracy,' and 'On Coalition Government'"; Group C will be taught "Basic Problems of the Chinese Revolution." (2) The study of current affairs and policies should become a regular and important political life for cadres. In the future, in addition to requiring regular study of Party newspapers and periodicals (not within the two-hour study time), and in conjunction with their work, constantly studying the central government's instructions on the current situation and policies, this winter should focus on the study of the CPPCC documents and the resolutions of the First Party Congress of Pingyuan Province. The study of current affairs and policies should not hinder the regular conduct of theoretical study. (3) This winter, institutions that have established amateur spare-time schools are required to further standardize them. Institutions that have not established them should all establish them. For amateur learning in institutions above the prefectural committee level, a dedicated person should be assigned to be responsible. In the future, in order to more effectively improve the cultural level of workers and peasants cadres, it is proposed that the Provincial People's Cadre School, after graduation of this term, should be transformed to focus on training workers and peasants cadres. The intellectual training classes of each special commissioner's office should be changed to cadre schools after the end of this term, and workers and peasants cadres should be selected for training. The study content of such special workers' and peasants' cadre schools should focus on culture. The provincial level can transfer cadres who are familiar with writing and require them to improve to the extent that they can read and write freely within one year; each special commissioner's office should transfer illiterate workers and peasants cadres and require them to be able to read popular books, newspapers, and documents, and be able to write simple letters and reports within one year; for cadres below the district level, because it is not easy to establish spare-time schools in institutions, it is necessary to vigorously solve the difficulties caused by the dispersion of work and the lack of self-study ability, and organize learning in work groups to achieve the effect of mutual assistance and mutual teaching. Study backbones can be appropriately equipped, and intellectual cadres should regard helping workers and peasants cadres improve their culture as their own task, striving to eliminate illiteracy among cadres within two or three years. (4) The theoretical study of district cadres can be carried out by concentrating the entire district or two or three small districts to attend large classes, once every half month, with each lecture lasting four hours, given by the main cadres at the district level who have lecturing ability. The county party committee can prepare outlines in advance, put forward key points, and conduct preparatory classes.
    The instructions concluded: At present, it is necessary to strengthen the leadership of in-service cadre study in order to adhere to the study movement and seek in-depth and improved learning. To this end, first of all, it is necessary to further improve the cadres' awareness of learning; secondly, it is necessary to strengthen the ideological leadership of cadres' learning. The most important key here is that leading cadres personally take action, resolutely overcome the leadership methods of empiricism and preoccupation with routine matters, adhere to their own learning, first learn well themselves, use learning to lead learning, pay attention to organizing reports, discussions, and seminars, clarify the purpose of learning a certain document, solve the difficulties in learning, and connect with the cadres' thoughts and work, and obtain criticism and improvement from learning theory.

　　平原干部读完社会发展史
  　省委提出一年学习计划
    要求负责干部以学习领导学习
    【平原讯】在全省一般干部读完“社会发展史”后，中共平原省委宣传部于最近发出关于在职干部今后一年学习计划的指示。规定：（一）在今后一年内，凡有阅读能力、理论水平、实际斗争经验的干部（可根据不同程度划分为甲、乙组），继续学习“政治经济学”、“共产党宣言”、“社会主义从空想到科学的发展”、“帝国主义论”、“国家与革命”五本书。凡无阅读能力、缺乏理论知识的编为丙组，讲授“中国革命基本问题、‘社会发展史’、薛暮桥著‘政治经济学’。今年冬季，要求甲组学完列昂节夫著‘政治经济学’；乙组应学完薛暮桥著‘政治经济学’；已学过政治经济学而未学中国革命基本问题的地、市、县仍应进行‘中国革命与中国共产党’、‘新民主主义论’、‘论联合政府’的学习”；丙组讲授“中国革命基本问题”。（二）时事政策的学习，应成为干部经常的重要政治生活，今后除要求经常研究党报党刊（不在两小时学习时间之内），并结合业务，不断研究中央关于时局政策的指示外，今冬应着重政协文献及平原省第一次党代表会议决议的学习。时事政策学习应不妨碍理论学习的经常进行。（三）今冬要求已建立机关业余补习学校的机关要进一步做到正规化，未建立的机关应一律建立起来，地委级以上机关业余学习准设一专人负责。今后为了更有效地提高工农干部文化水平，提议省府人民干部学校，在本期结业后，即转入以培养工农干部为主；各专署知识分子训练班本期结束后，一律改为干部学校，抽训工农干部。此种专设的工农干部学校，学习内容以文化为主，省级可抽调粗通文字的干部，要求于一年内提高到能自由阅读自由写作的程度；各专署抽调不识字的工农干部，要求于一年内达到能看通俗的书报和文件，能写简单的信和报告；区以下的干部学习，因机关业余学校不易建立，必须大力解决工作分散与无自学能力所形成的困难，以工作组为单位组织学习，以收互助互教之效。学习骨干可适当配备，知识分子干部要将帮助工农干部提高文化当成自已的任务，求得在二三年内，在干部中消灭文盲。（四）区干部的理论学习可实行全区或两三个小区集中上大课的办法，半月一次，每次讲授四小时，由区级有讲解能力的主要干部担任；县委可事前拟制提纲，提出要点，上预备课。
    指示末称：目前必须加强在职干部学习的领导，以坚持学习运动，求得学习的深入与提高。为此，首先要进一步提高干部的学习自觉；其次必须加强对干部学习的思想领导，这里最重要的关键是领导干部亲自动手，坚决克服经验主义事务主义的领导方法，坚持自己的学习，自已首先学好，用学习领导学习，注意组织报告、讨论、座谈，明确学习某一文件的目的，解决学习中的疑难，联系干部的思想与工作，从学习理论中得到批判与提高。
