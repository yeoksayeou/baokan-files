　　Examples of Changes in Production and Distribution Relations in the Liberated Areas of China
    For example, in our People's Democratic New China's liberated areas, under the leadership of the Communist Party, due to the victory of the People's Liberation War, the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang imperialists was overthrown and eliminated, and a people's democratic government led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance was established. In the newly liberated areas, rent reduction and interest rate reduction were implemented, and land relations were partially adjusted, especially the distribution relations of agricultural products, reducing and weakening feudal and semi-feudal exploitation, and initially changing the semi-slave status of peasants. This is only a partial transformation of distribution relations and distribution laws. However, if this partial transformation is carried out thoroughly, it can also affect production relations and production laws. For example, in areas where rent reduction and interest rate reduction were thoroughly implemented during the Anti-Japanese War, the lives of ordinary peasants were generally improved, thereby increasing the peasants' enthusiasm for production. Because the peasants had the surplus to improve production or expand production, the productive forces were partially improved and developed, and a foundation was laid for organizing collective labor. Some areas basically realized "land to the tiller," that is, basically changed the relations of production. However, in any case, this transformation must first be premised on the people's masses establishing their own political power and controlling political power themselves. At the same time, it must also be accompanied by the transformation of production relations. Therefore, after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, based on the demands of the peasant masses, the Chinese Communist Party issued the Outline Land Law of China, announcing the abolition of feudal and semi-feudal land relations, confiscating the land of the landlord class, levying surplus land from old-style rich peasants, distributing it to the landless and land-poor peasant masses, and making it their property, implementing "land to the tiller." Therefore, all areas that implemented land reform thoroughly eliminated feudal and semi-feudal relations of production and the exploitation system. The peasant masses were liberated and established new agricultural production relations. The working people themselves had land and other means of labor. All agricultural products, except for a portion of taxes paid to the people's democratic government, belonged to and were controlled by themselves, thereby greatly increasing the peasants' enthusiasm for production, liberating and improving the peasants' productive forces, and preparing for further improvement and development. For example, after the People's Liberation War, we confiscated the bureaucratic capital (semi-colonial and semi-feudal state monopoly capitalism) headed by the four major families of the Kuomintang and brought the large factories and mines of the bureaucratic capital under the ownership of the people's democratic state, implementing democratic management. The working class became the masters of state-owned enterprises. There were no so-called labor-capital relations there, completely changing the original production relations and production laws, fundamentally changing the nature of New Democratic state enterprises, and turning them into socialist enterprises. There was no exploitation there, and therefore the distribution relations and distribution laws there also underwent fundamental changes, enabling it to implement the principle of distribution according to work based on the difference in the quantity and quality of labor. Under the current situation of frequent fluctuations in wartime prices, in order to ensure that the distribution of the working class is not affected by price fluctuations, under the new wage system, they obtain material guarantees and can be adjusted monthly according to the cost of living index for employees, and are given preferential treatment with low-priced allocation by trade agencies and cooperatives. Therefore, changes or reforms in distribution relations and distribution laws must be premised on changes or reforms in production relations and production laws.
    This situation can also be seen in private capitalist economies. In today's New Democratic economy, although the production and distribution relations of private capitalism have not undergone essential changes in nature, they are no longer and cannot be exactly the same as private capital under the original capitalist system. Under the leadership of the New Democratic state and with the support and guarantee of the people's democratic government, the working class can partially adjust the labor-capital production relations and the distribution relations between labor and capital under the principle of "benefit to both labor and capital."
　　The Relationship between Production and Consumption
    Consumption also includes the consumption of means of production, the consumption of labor, and the consumption of products.
    First of all, the consumption of means of production and the consumption of labor are mutually accompanied, and they are the process in which the means of production and labor combine and function, that is, the production process of products. Because people must have means of production and labor to engage in production, and production can only take place in the combination and function of the two, and only then can products be produced. Moreover, the consumption of labor is more directly the use of labor – labor. Because the use of labor and means of production (that is, the consumption of means of production) allows production to proceed, and only in this way can products be produced in the combination and function of the two. Therefore, Marx said:
    "Production and consumption are directly identical; production is consumption, and consumption is production."
    "Production is directly consumption, and consumption is directly production." (Ibid.)
    Secondly, the consumption of products is also the same. In terms of the two types of products, namely means of production and means of subsistence; the consumption of means of production is to produce or reproduce products (means of production or means of production), and the consumption of means of subsistence is to produce or reproduce human labor. Therefore, consumption is also production, and production is also consumption. For example, the production of cotton cloth is also the consumption of cotton yarn, looms, and weaver labor. This consumption is the consumption of production. In addition, consumption is also directly productive. For example, people's clothing, food, housing, and all supplies are means of subsistence necessary for people's survival. Without them, human beings cannot continue to survive. At the same time, people consume them and produce labor. Therefore, although this consumption does not directly produce products, it is the production of consumption because it produces labor.
    The above is the relationship between consumption and production. As for the relationship between production and consumption, according to Marx:
    "Production produces consumption, because: (1) production creates the material of consumption, (2) production stipulates the method of consumption, and (3) production stimulates the consumer's desires with the product as the object of consumption. That is, production produces the object of consumption, the method of consumption, and the impulse of consumption. Similarly, consumption [produces] the producer's design, because consumption gives the producer a purpose and triggers the producer's desire." (Ibid.)
    Therefore, production and consumption are unified. However, production is basic and dominant. Because consumption must be based on production as a prerequisite, without production, there can be no consumption at all, and the expansion of consumption must rely on the expansion of production; "those who eat are many, and those who produce are few" and "those who use are quick, and those who make are slow" will not work.
　　Criticism of the Bourgeois Theory of Production and Consumption Utility
    Some bourgeois and bourgeois economists are unclear about consumption and production. For example, Marshall, a vulgar neo-classical economist (author of Principles of Economics, etc.), said that production is the production of utility, the increase of utility, and consumption is the decrease or destruction of utility. According to his statement, if wheat grows in the ground, the utility increases, which is production; after harvesting, it is ground into flour and made into bread, the utility increases even more, which is also production, but when bread is eaten into the stomach, it is consumption, and the utility decreases or is destroyed. This vulgar bourgeois economist actually has the least economic common sense. They do not know that the moment bread is eaten into the stomach is precisely when utility occurs. The bourgeois economic theory of utility value can neither explain production nor explain consumption. However, some Chinese bourgeois economists still regard it as a classic and peddle these goods.
　　Economic Relations
    In summary: regarding the relationship of production to exchange, distribution, and consumption, production is basic and dominant. Exchange, distribution, and consumption for production are all referred to as elements included in production. According to Marx, "although not the same, they form members of a totality, a unified internal difference" (Ibid.), and are unified in the general process of production.
    The relations formed in the exchange process are called exchange relations, the relations formed in the distribution process are called distribution relations, and the relations formed in the consumption process are called consumption relations. Together with the relations of production formed in the production process, they are called the relations of production, that is, the economic relations of society. The movement of this economic relationship forms the economic movement of society.

  　政治经济学的研究对象任务及其特点

　　中国解放区生产关系与分配关系改变的例证
    又如：在我们人民民主新中国的解放区，在共产党的领导下，由于人民解放战争的胜利，推翻消灭了国民党帝国主义的反动统治、建立了工人阶级领导的以工农联盟为主体的人民民主政权，在新解放区开始时实行减租减息，部分地调整了土地关系，特别是农业生产物的分配关系，减轻削弱封建的与半封建的剥削，初步改变了农民半奴隶式的地位。这仅仅是分配关系与分配规律的部分改造。但是这种局部的改造，如果彻底地进行，也是能够影响生产关系与生产规律的，例如：抗日战争时期解放区减租减息进行贯彻彻底的地区，一般的农民生活得到了改善，从而提高了农民的生产热忱，并因农民有余力改进生产，或扩大生产，从而部分地提高与发展了生产力，并为组织起来进行集体劳动奠定了基础，有的地区则基本上实现了耕者有其田，即基本上改变了生产关系。然而无论如何，这种改造首先必须以人民大众建立自己的政权，自己掌握政权为前提，同时，还必须伴随着有生产关系的改造。所以抗日战争胜利后，中国共产党基于农民大众的要求，颁发了中国土地法大纲，宣布废除封建的与半封建的土地关系，没收地主阶级的土地，征收旧式富农多余的土地，分配给无地少地的贫苦农民大众，并为他们所有，实行耕者有其田，从而凡是实行了土地改革的地区，都彻底消灭了封建的与半封建的生产关系与剥削制度，农民大众得到了翻身，建立了新的农业生产关系。劳动人民自己有了土地及其他劳动手段，农业生产物除了缴纳给人民民主政府的一部分赋税负担以外，全部归自己所有与支配，从而大大地提高了农民的生产积极性，使农民生产力获得了解放与提高，并且备了进一步提高发展的可能与条件。又如：人民解放战争以后，我们没收了以国民党四大家族为首的官僚资本（半殖民地半封建的国家垄断资本主义），把官僚资本的大工厂、大矿山收归人民民主国家所有，实行管理民主化，工人阶级做了国家企业的主人翁，那里已经没有所谓劳资关系，彻底地改变了原来的生产关系与生产规律，使新民主主义国家企业从根本上改变了性质，成为社会主义性质的企业。那里也没有了剥削，从而那里的分配关系与分配规律也获得了根本的变革，使它能够按照劳动力的量与质的区别，实行按劳计值的原则。在今天战时物价经常波动的情况下，为了使工人阶级的分配得以不受物价波动的影响，在新的工资制度下，获得实物保证，并可逐月按照职工生活指数予以调整，而且由贸易机关与合作社给予廉价配售的优待。所以分配关系与分配规律的变化或改革，必须以生产关系与生产规律的变化或改革为前提。
    这种情况，即使在私人资本主义经济中，也是可以看到的。在今天我们新民主主义经济下，私人资本主义的生产关系与分配关系，虽然在性质上还没有本质的改变，但也已经不是也不可能是与原来资本主义制度下的私人资本完全一样了。工人阶级由于新民主主义国家的领导，由于人民民主政权的支持保证，在“劳资两利”的原则下，得以部分地调整劳资的生产关系与劳资间的分配关系。
　　生产与消费的关系
    消费也包括生产手段的消费，劳动力的消费，与生产物的消费三个方面。
    首先生产手段的消费，与劳动力的消费过程，是相互伴随着的，它们就是生产手段与劳动力相互结合发生作用的过程，也就是生产物的生产过程。因为人们从事生产，必须要有生产手段与劳动力，并在它们两者的结合发生作用中才能生产，才能生产出生产物来。而劳动力的消费，更直接的是劳动力的使用——劳动。由于劳动力与生产手段的使用（即生产手段的消费），生产才能进行，也只有这样在他们两者的结合发生作用中才能生产出生产物来。所以马克思说：
    “生产与消费是直接一致的，生产就是消费，消费就是生产。”
    “生产直接是消费，消费直接是生产。”（同上）
    其次，生产物的消费也是如此。就生产物的两个种类，即生产手段与生活资料来说；生产手段的消费是生产或再生产出生产物（生产手段或生产资料）来，生活资料的消费是生产或再生产出人类的劳动力来。所以消费同时就是生产，生产同时就是消费。例如：棉布的生产，同时就是棉纱、织布机与织工劳动力等等的消费。这种消费，就是生产的消费。此外，消费还直接是生产的，例如：人们衣、食、住一切用品都是人们生存所必需的生活资料，没有了他们，人类就无法继续生存下去，同时人们消费了它们，就生产出劳动力来。所以这种消费，虽然不是直接生产出生产物来，但是因为生产劳动力，故是消费的生产。
    以上是消费与生产的关系。至于生产与消费的关系，依据马克思的说法：
    “生产生产着消费，因为：（一）生产创造着消费的材料，（二）生产规定着消费的方法，（三）生产着生产物作为消费的对象刺戟着消费者的欲望。即，生产生产着消费的对象，消费的方法，消费的冲动。同样，消费【生产着】生产者的设计，因为消费给生产者以目的，诱发着生产者的欲望。”（同上）
    因此，生产与消费是统一的。但是基本的，主导的还是生产。因为消费必须以生产为前提，没有生产，就根本不可能有消费，消费要扩大，必须依靠生产的扩大；“食之者众，生之者寡”“用之者疾，为之者舒”是不行的。
　　对资产阶级的生产与消费效用说的批评
    有的资产阶级与资产阶级经济学者对消费与生产分不清楚。例如：庸俗的新古典学派经济学大家马歇尔（著有经济学原理等著作），说生产是效用的生产、效用的增加，消费是效用的减少或破坏等话。如果照他的说法，麦子种在地里长大以后，效用增加，这是生产；收获以后磨成面，制成面包效用更增加，也是生产，但当面包吃到肚里就是消费，效用就减少了，或者被破坏了。这种庸俗的资产阶级经济学大家事实上最无经济常识，他们不知道面包吃到肚子里正是发生效用的时候。资产阶级经济学的效用价值说既说明不了生产，也说明不了消费。可是中国某些资产阶级经济学者还奉之为经典，贩卖这些货色。
　　经济关系
    综上以观：生产对于交换、分配、消费的关系，生产是基本的、主导的。交换、分配、消费对于生产，都被称为包括在生产内的诸要素。照马克思的说法：它们“虽然不是说是同一的，但却是形成着一个总体性的成员，一个统一的内部差异”（同上），而被统一于生产的总过程。
    以上人们在交换过程中形成的关系叫做交换关系，在分配过程中形成的关系叫做分配关系，在消费过程中形成的关系叫做消费关系，它们与人们在生产过程中形成的生产关系，总起来叫做生产诸关系，也就是社会的经济关系。这种经济关系的运动，形成着社会的经济运动。
