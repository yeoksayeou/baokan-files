　　Establishing Spare-Time Schools
    The Second Session of the People's Representatives of All Circles in Beijing passed the "Resolution on Establishing Spare-Time Remedial Schools" yesterday. This is a very meaningful construction work, which will promote the arrival of a high tide in Beijing's production and cultural construction. Article 41 of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference stipulates: "The cultural and educational work of the People's Government should take raising the cultural level of the people, training talents for national construction, eradicating feudal, comprador, and fascist ideologies, and developing the idea of serving the people as its main tasks." Article 46 stipulates: "Implement universal education in a planned and step-by-step manner, strengthen secondary and higher education, focus on technology, strengthen spare-time education for laborers and on-the-job cadre education, and give revolutionary political education to young intellectuals and old intellectuals to meet the extensive needs of revolutionary work and national construction work." The resolution on establishing spare-time remedial schools passed by the Second Session of the People's Representatives of All Circles in Beijing is a step towards realizing the above-mentioned program.
    Since the liberation of Beijing, various training classes established for workers and cadres have played an important role. These training classes have focused on political education. In addition, workers' children's remedial classes attached to various primary and secondary schools, which mainly focus on cultural education, have enrolled 10,609 new students; 617 children's literacy classes have absorbed 18,604 children. Various forms of adult remedial education have also been carried out in schools, government agencies, organizations, and factories. According to statistics from late October, there were already 96 adult remedial schools with 5,705 students, and more than 100 classes have been established in the suburbs. However, all of this is still far from enough and lags behind the needs of the masses. In the past six months, due to the recent liberation of the city, the focus of work has been on stabilizing social order and restoring and developing production. Therefore, it has not been possible to take care of the construction of large-scale mass cultural education in more aspects. Now the situation has changed a lot. In economic construction, the broad masses of workers and staff members are increasingly eager to improve their cultural level and learn new knowledge and skills, but they feel that there is no way to enter, or they feel that ordinary remedial classes cannot meet their desire for knowledge. If they want to enter regular schools, they are troubled by not being able to take care of their work at the same time. With the Beijing's decision to establish spare-time schools, these problems should be able to find a solution. The establishment of regular spare-time schools, adopting the policy of unified leadership, decentralized teaching, and gradual promotion with key points and steps is completely correct. Other cities across the country can follow suit and try to implement it when conditions permit. We warmly hope and congratulate that this kind of regular spare-time school will be established quickly in the capital, learn from experience, so as to promote it. We believe that our people's educators will enthusiastically participate in this glorious work and jointly complete the great task of popularizing education and cultivating talents for national construction.

### 建立业余学校

　　建立业余学校
    北京市第二届各界人民代表会议，昨日通过了“关于开办业余补习学校的决议”。这是一项很有意义的建设工作，它将促进北京市生产建设与文化建设高潮的到来。中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领第四十一条规定：“人民政府的文化教育工作，应以提高人民文化水平、培养国家建设人才、肃清封建的、买办的、法西斯主义的思想、发展为人民服务的思想为主要任务。”第四十六条规定：“有计划有步骤地实行普及教育，加强中等教育和高等教育，注重技术，加强劳动者的业余教育和在职干部教育，给青年知识分子和旧知识分子以革命的政治教育，以应革命工作和国家建设工作的广泛需要。”北京市第二届各界代表会议所通过的开办业余补习学校的决议，就是实现上述纲领的一个步骤。
    北京解放以来，为工人和干部所开办的各种训练班，曾发挥了重要作用。这些训练班是以政治教育为主的，此外，附设于各中小学的以文化教育为主的工人子弟补习班等，招收了新生一万零六百零九人；六百一十七个儿童识字班，吸收的儿童达一万八千六百零四名。在各学校、机关、团体、工厂中，还进行了各种不同形式的成人补习教育。据十月下旬统计，已有成人补习学校九十六处，学生五千七百零五人，另在郊区成立了一百多个班。但所有这些，都还是很不够的，还落后于群众的需要。在过去的半年中由于城市解放不久，工作的重点在于安定社会秩序，恢复与发展生产，因此，还不可能更多方面地照顾到大规模的群众文化教育的建设，现在情形有了许多改变，而在经济建设中，广大的工人和工作人员，也日益迫切地要求提高文化水平，学习新的知识和技能，但他们感到无门可入，或者觉得普通的补习班满足不了自己的求知欲，要想进正规的学校又苦于不能兼顾工作。这些问题现在有了北京市建立业余学校的决议，应该可以找到解决的途径了。正规的业余学校的开办，采取统一领导，分散教学，有重点、有步骤地逐渐推广的方针是完全正确的，全国其他各城市在条件许可时均可仿效试办。我们热烈地希望并祝贺这种正规的业余学校在首都迅速地建立起来，吸取经验，以便推广，相信我们人民的教育家们，将会踊跃地参加这一光荣的工作，共同完成普及教育、培养国家建设人才的伟大任务。
