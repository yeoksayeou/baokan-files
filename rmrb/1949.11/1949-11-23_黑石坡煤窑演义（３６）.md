　　The confiscated dirt kilns that had once belonged to Jupao, as well as the larger kiln, treated as the property of the traitor Jupao, were handed over to the collective of the Hun Village. However, no regulations were established following the confiscation. Since the harsh winds in the kiln bottom were late in arriving that year, Jupao's two dirt kilns were still in operation. Yu Bao instructed them to contribute 20% of their earnings to the committee as village funds. As for the west entrance of the larger kiln, Yu Bao argued that Tai Cheng and Niu Bao had spent considerable labor clearing the water to open the coal seam, so the village would not collect any fees for the time being, with future arrangements to be decided later. Consequently, Tai Cheng and Niu Bao treated the kiln as if it were their own. The original water accumulation in this kiln wasn't too excessive, and they bailed out less than half of it. The remainder was left to accumulate in a pit, disregarding kiln regulations and the direction of the tunnels. They indiscriminately mined coal close to the entrance, creating an uneven terrain with bumps and hollows, a practice known in the local kiln jargon as "eating ash." Many villagers disapproved of this, but no one spoke out. Only Da San was so enraged that he couldn't contain himself. One day, he rushed to the kiln site and, with his two round eyes wide open, shouted: "Damn it all, this kiln has been ruined for over a decade, and now it's finally liberated! Eat ash, will you! Communism, my ass! Damn it!" At that moment, Niu Bao was carrying a load of coal from the kiln. He dropped the load and retorted to Da San: "Who the hell are you yelling at? Is this your kiln? Are you the consul here? Hmph! No one can oppress me now! I've seen it all!" Da San waved his arm and yelled at Niu Bao: "I'm not afraid of you, kid! You just wait! The day Zhang Yuanluo throws you to the curb, I'll be damned!" Niu Bao immediately rolled up his sleeves, looking like he was ready for a fight. Fortunately, Tianlu arrived just in time to quietly pull Da San away; but Niu Bao was still spitting, clapping his hands, stomping his feet, and waving his fists, continuing his tirade.

　　　　Thirty-Three Old Yin

　　Soon, the harsh winds arrived in the kiln, and it was time to tend to the fields. The Black Rock Slope Village was bustling with activity, and life seemed to return to its past normalcy.

　　However, there were some differences. Yu Bao, Niu Bao, and other cadres had opened a small shop in the village, selling cigarettes, liquor, oil, salt, soy sauce, vinegar, and noodles. This shop wasn't open during the day, but it was brightly lit at night. It was rumored that Yu Bao and his committee members also held meetings there, making it a gathering place for villagers.

　　Furthermore, there was another difference. One time, after returning from a meeting in the district, Yu Bao suddenly ordered all those living in the dirt kilns outside the village to move back to their original houses and kilns. After this, Tianlu seemed much more refreshed. He moved back into his own house and was also allocated some land, dedicating himself to farming. Although Shuan Cheng wasn't entirely happy, he couldn't help but say to Da San: "Anyway, we're liberated! It seems like the regulations from above aren't bad, it's just the village that's messed up. If the higher-ups clarify the situation, I'm sure things will get better." But Da San was constantly displeased. He couldn't get any information from Lao Bai. He resented Yu Bao's wielding of power in the village, especially the reckless mismanagement of the large kiln, which infuriated him to no end. He also heard that most of the coal and iron industries in the surrounding areas were not operating, the mines at Yangquan Station hadn't properly recovered, and the harvest wasn't good. How could it be that after liberation, no one was taking charge? In short, he felt that this didn't taste like liberation.

　　Meanwhile, the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region Land Reform Work Team, known as the North China Brigade or "Hua Da" by the people, arrived in the Pingding and Yangquan area. These "Hua Da" members sought out the poor and spoke truthfully, earning praise and spreading legends throughout the villages. Initially, they only worked in Yin'ying and Pingtan'nao villages, where their work was said to be excellent. Upon learning about this, Da San and Shuan Cheng were eager to inquire about the situation from acquaintances in those villages where "Hua Da" was working. By August, rumors spread that "Hua Da" would be sending people to each village, which thrilled Da San and Shuan Cheng. However, some in Black Rock Slope Village spread rumors: "Yan Xishan is going to occupy Yangquan again!" "When 'Hua Da' arrives, we mustn't say anything to them, lest we suffer later!" Da San was infuriated by these rumors, but Shuan Cheng said: "These must be bad people trying to scare us. To hell with them! Anyway, things will be better when 'Hua Da' comes." Only then did Da San remain silent, eagerly awaiting the arrival of "Hua Da."

　　In fact, "Hua Da" had indeed dispatched a cadre to Black Rock Slope. This man was named Yin Nian, from Hebei Province. He had attended middle school and farmed before the war. He joined the workforce after the war and became a member of the Communist Party, serving as a district chief and county government secretary. He had done a lot of mass work in the old revolutionary base areas. In his daily work, he would often tilt his head back, slowly blinking his eyes as he pondered problems. If he couldn't figure things out, his work would be awkward and slow. But once he understood something, he would go all out. Before coming to the countryside this time, he had listened to many reports, studied many documents, and engaged in discussions and research. He realized that most of his past mass work had been done solely to complete tasks. He would replace the masses in handling affairs. Later, when the Party called on everyone to implement the mass line and consult with the masses in their work, he would only consult with a few cadres after arriving in the village. Although he sometimes approached the masses, he didn't engage enough with the hired laborers and poor peasants. As a result, the broad masses couldn't be effectively mobilized, and the mass line that he had repeatedly talked about hadn't truly been learned. Therefore, this time in the countryside, he was determined to honestly and patiently learn to serve the people wholeheartedly as a long-term farmhand. When working in Pingtan'nao, he had indeed learned some methods and gained some experience. When he was assigned to Black Rock Slope Village, he consulted with several people in Pingtan'nao who knew about the situation there. He also talked to the district leadership, learning that in the spring, when the area had just been liberated, the leadership had failed to recognize that this newly liberated area had been ruled by the Japanese invaders and Yan Xishan for many years, that our work and influence were minimal, and that the masses were both happy and fearful after liberation. At that time, relying solely on enthusiasm, they wanted to ignite village after village with liquidations and revenge within a few days. If there were no cadres available, they would simply grab someone, and Black Rock Slope had randomly chosen an elementary school teacher who had been working for less than a year, resulting in a complete mess. It was said that the current village cadres were highly problematic... Yin Nian understood these circumstances, tilted his head back, blinked his eyes for a while, discussed it with the leaders, and then set off for Black Rock Slope Village.

　　Yin Nian had inquired extensively in Pingtan'nao and knew that Black Rock Slope had a small, single, outsider who had worked as a long-term laborer for the wealthy Zhang Jupao for many years and was known to be very honest. Therefore, as soon as he arrived in Black Rock Slope Village, he went straight to Bian Xiao's house and stayed there, seeking out no one else and doing nothing. For two days, almost no one in the village knew he was there.

　　Yin Nian treated Bian Xiao very well. At that time, there was a drought, and Bian Xiao didn't have enough to eat. Yin Nian exchanged his grain coupons for millet and insisted on sharing it with Bian Xiao. Bian Xiao had only a small amount of autumn harvest, but Yin Nian insisted on helping him with the harvest. Bian Xiao only had a tattered sheepskin jacket, with no bedding. Yin Nian gave him a blanket to use as a bed. At first, Bian Xiao was quite afraid, but slowly he softened and thought: What is this guy up to? Why should I be afraid of him? Even if there's a sweet before the bitter, what good would it do this guy to give me someone like me a hard time? He doesn't seem like someone who would harm me... Looking back at the old days with the Japanese devils and Yan's army, what was that like...? He thought about it over and over, day and night, and gradually he stopped being so wary of Yin Nian. He opened up and told him everything. After five or six days, he even stopped calling him "Comrade Yin" and started calling him "Old Yin." Old Yin stayed with him day and night, chatting warmly and cheerfully, just like an old pal. Pals get along like family. After a few days, Bian Xiao's other pals, like Shuan Cheng and Da San, also came to see Bian Xiao's new pal, and everyone was warm and cheerful. That's how Yin Nian gained a foothold in Black Rock Slope Village and started his work.

　　黑石坡煤窑演义（３６）
　　康濯
    再有聚宝的土窑没收了，大窑也给当作了汉奸聚宝的财产，同样归了浑村大伙，但也没见闹出个没收以后的规章。碰对这年窑底风硬得晚，聚宝的两座土窑一直有人在动弹，玉宝就叫他们把收入抽二成给委员会当村款；那大窑的西口窑，玉宝说那是泰成牛宝他们花白工打了水才创开炭，村里当下就不抽了，往后再说往后的办法。这么一来，泰成牛宝他们就把这窑当成了自己的一样，原来这窑积水本不算太多，他们担了不到一半，剩下的就让水积在一个坑里，也不管窑里的规矩，也不管岔道不岔道，每日下窑刨炭，只一个劲挑着离窑口近的地势乱刨，把个好行道创得这里凹一块那里凸一道的，正是当地窑里的行话，叫作“吃灰食”。村里不少的人对这很看不过意，但也没谁说话，只有大三生气得万也别不住，有一天他就跑到窑场上，鼓着两圆溜溜的大眼直嚷道：“肏他妈的这窑毁了十来年，这会也算是解放啦！吃灰食吧！共产吧！肏他妈的！”这时牛宝正从窑里担了担炭上来，他把担子一撂，就回大三道：“你他妈骂谁？这是你的窑？是你当领事？哼！这会谁也不能压迫老子！老子什么没见过？”大三也胳膊一挥，冲着牛宝道：“我还尿不着你小子！你等着吧！有朝一日我张远禄不把你撂到半边不算人！”牛宝立时气虎虎地挽着袖子，真象要打一场的架势，亏得天禄恰好赶来，才不声不响地拉开了大三；但牛宝却还在这边吐唾沫拍巴掌跺脚挥拳地骂。
    　　　　三十三　老尹
    日子不多，窑里风硬了，又是养种地的时候。这时黑石坡村人人忙着动弹，村里又和过去一样样，平静没事。
    但村里也有跟过去不一样的事，就是玉宝牛宝干大脑们在村里伙开了个小铺，零卖烟酒油盐酱醋面；这小铺白天不开门，黑夜才灯火明亮，听说玉宝那堆委员们也在那里办公，算是给村里添了个烘火地势。
    此外，村里还有跟过去不一样的事：有一回玉宝从区里开会回来，忽然叫那伙住在村外土窑的都搬回了原房原窑。这以后，天禄眉眼清爽得多，他又住上了自己的房子，并且也分了点地，每日就埋着头子动弹；拴成虽说不大痛快，却也短不了对大三说：“反正是解放了！看架势，上头的规章还就是不赖，坏就是坏在村里；往后上头要是闹清了情由，我看准会好起来的。”但大三却老是挺不痛快：他打问老白也打问不着，在村里，又恨透了玉宝拿权办事，特别是大窑给那么胡折腾着，他更气得五脏六腑都快要炸开；他又听说方圆左近的煤铁两行大多没开工，阳泉站上的矿厂也没有好好恢复，年景又不强，可怎么解放了还没人管？一句话：他觉着这不够个解放的味。
    却说这时平定阳泉一带，来了个晋察冀边区的土地改革工作团，名叫华北大队，四乡人们都管他们叫“华大”。说起这华大，他们是尽找穷人，光说直理，老百姓个个称赞，村村传说。可他们一开头只作了荫营、平潭垴几个村，听说作得真不赖；大三拴成二人知道了这事，就心庠庠地，短不了寻那有华大在工作的村子里的热人问讯。到八月间，听说华大要往各村派人了，大三拴成乐的不行；但黑石坡却有人传说：“阎锡山又要占阳泉！”“华大来了，可不敢给人家说什么，免得后日吃苦头！”大三一听这些就冒火，拴成却道：“这准是坏人们哧唬人的，管球它哩！反正华大来了就好了。”大三这才没说什么，一股劲单等华大来。
    再说华大也的确正派了个干部到黑石坡来。这人叫尹年，河北省人，抗战前念过中学也种过地，抗战后参加工作，并参加了共产党，当过区长和县政府秘书，在老根据地作过不少群众工作。这人平日作事，好仰着脖子眼皮不紧不慢地扑展着想问题，想不通就蹩蹩扭扭地工作不前不后，想通了就一定一股劲干下去。他这回下乡以前，听了好些报告，学了很多文件，又进行了讨论研究，他想通了他过去作的群众工作，大多只是为了完成任务，便自己代替群众办事，后来党号召大家执行群众路线，作工作要跟群众商量，但他作的也不过是到村以后跟几个干部商量，有时虽说也接近接近群众，却对雇工、贫农接近得不够，结果广大群众还是不能很好发动，而他嘴上说过不知多少遍的群众路线，他却并没有真正学会多少。因此，他这回下乡，就下决心要老老实实耐心地学习全心全意给老百姓当长工，在平潭垴工作的时候，他也的确学得了一些办法和经验。当他被分配到黑石坡村的时候，他就在平潭垴找了几个知道黑石坡情况的群众打问了一下；他又去区里谈了谈，知道了春天刚解放那会，领导上没有认清这片新解放地区是日寇和阎锡山统治了多年，我们的工作和影响很少，群众在解放后是又喜又怕，当时却只凭一股热劲，要几天就村村点火清算复仇，没有干部就随便抓，黑石坡便是找了个刚参加工作不到一年的小学教员，稀里马虎去闹了一下，结果闹下了一屁股的糊糊，现在村里的干部听说还很有问题……尹年了解这些情由，就一个人仰着脖子扑展着眼皮想了一阵，又跟领导人谈了谈，才动身到黑石坡村去。
    尹年在平潭垴早就打问好了，知道黑石坡有个扁小，光棍汉，外来户，给财主张聚宝扛了多年长活，为人很老实；因此，他一到黑石坡村，就一直寻到扁小家里住下，谁也不找，什么也不作，他去了两天，村里还没什么人知道。
    尹年待扁小挺好。当时天旱不收，扁小吃不上什么粮食，尹年就拿出粮票换了小米，硬叫扁小一锅吃饭；扁小有不大点秋，营生不多，尹年却也非要帮他收秋；扁小只一件破皮袄，没铺没盖，尹年就给条毯子给铺盖。一开头扁小还挺着怕，这么慢慢地，扁小就光觉着心软，心想：人家这是为的什么？咱凭什么怕人家？要说先甜后辣，可人家给咱这号人辣的又有什么好处？人家又哪里象个害人的啊？看往日那日本洋鬼和阎军的，又是什么架势……他左思右想，日思夜想，他也早就对尹年不结记什么，一天天放开嘴什么也说了。这么呆了五六天，他干脆连“尹同志”也不叫，叫开了“老尹”；老尹跟他日夜不离，热热火火痛痛快快有说有笑，真象个老伙计。伙计们相好就象一家人，不几天，扁小另外的伙计象拴成大三他们，也就短不了来寻扁小这新交结的伙计捣拉，大伙又是热火痛快。尹年也就是这么在黑石坡村扎住了脚跟，干开了工作。
