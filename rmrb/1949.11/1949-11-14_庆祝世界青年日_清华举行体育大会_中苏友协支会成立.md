    Celebrating World Youth Day
    Tsinghua Holds Sports Meet
    Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Branch Established
    [Report from our newspaper] To celebrate World Youth Day, Tsinghua teachers, students, workers, and police held an unprecedented sports meet at the large sports ground yesterday (13th) starting at 12:30 pm; a celebration evening party was held in the auditorium in the evening, and the Tsinghua branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association was established. More than 2,000 people attended the sports meet. Chairman Ma John delivered a speech, pointing out that holding the sports meet on World Youth Day has great significance. Now, production construction, national defense construction, and other various tasks require youth to undertake them, and youth must use sports to cultivate their own healthy bodies to complete these tasks. Academic Dean Zhou Peiyuan called on students to have a certain amount of sports activities every day and take good care of their bodies. He said: In the past, sports meets focused on individual competition. Today our sports meet is collective, healthy, young, and a part of the new democratic education. The sports meet ended at 6:00 pm. There were various performances and competitions from various departments, trade unions, faculty and staff associations, Chengzhi primary and secondary schools, and female students. There were also apparatus exercises by the Beijing Gymnastics Joint Team, as well as Chinese martial arts performances. Most of the performances were collective and were carefully created by teachers, students, workers, and police. For example, the workers' dance of the Civil Engineering Department and the Construction Department, and the workers' exercises of the Mechanical Engineering Department, fully demonstrated the great spirit of workers' labor operations. In the competition, the trade union won the championship in the tug-of-war, and the whole audience cheered: "Our workers have strength!" Professors also participated in the relay race and tug-of-war. Although they failed, they were still very excited and prepared to come again next time.

    庆祝世界青年日
    清华举行体育大会
    中苏友协支会成立
    【本报讯】清华师生工警为庆祝世界青年日，昨（十三）日十二时半起在大操场举行盛况空前的体育大会；晚上在大礼堂举行庆祝晚会，并成立中苏友协清华支会。体育大会到会二千余人。大会主席马约翰致词，指出体育会在世界青年日举行有很大的意义。现在生产建设、国防建设以及其他的各种工作都需要青年来担负，青年们必须用体育来培养自己健全的身体，完成这些任务。教务长周培源号召同学每天要有一定的体育活动，搞好身体。他说：以前开运动会着重的是个人竞赛，今天我们的体育大会，是集体的、是健康的、年青的，是新民主主义教育中的一部分。体育会至下午六点结束。会中有各院系、工会，教职联、成志中小学、女同学的各种表演和竞赛。并有北京技巧联合队的器械操，另外还有国术表演。各项表演大部分是集体的，都是师生工警共同精心创造的。如土木系、营建系的工人舞，机械系的工人操，充分表现了工人劳动操作的伟大气魄。在竞赛当中，工会获得拔河的冠军，全场一致欢呼：“咱们工人有力量！”教授也参加接力赛和拔河，虽然失败，他们仍然很兴奋，准备下次再来。
