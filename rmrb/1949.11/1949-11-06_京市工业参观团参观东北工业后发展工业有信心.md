[Beijing News] The Beijing Industrial Delegation visited the Tiexi Industrial Zone in Shenyang and the iron and steel industries in Anshan and Fushun on the 25th of last month. They also learned about the "New Record Creation Movement" being carried out in various industrial and mining enterprises in the Northeast. This visit helped many factories in Beijing solve many problems. Liu Gongjun of the Jianguo Iron Factory said, "After seeing the wrought iron billets produced in Anshan, I realized that China is capable of producing these raw materials. When I return to Beijing, I will definitely improve the machines and expand business." Li Wenhe, manager of Baofeng Iron Factory, discovered that the machine tools needed by the machinery factory, such as gears, milling machines, lathes, electric rollers, twist drills, and diamond cutter heads, are not only manufactured by various machinery factories in the Northeast, but are also particularly precise. He said, "The iron factories in Beijing can confidently develop production. There will be no shortage of precise machine tools!"

　　京市工业参观团参观东北工业后发展工业有信心
    【北京讯】北京市工业参观团于上月二十五日在沈阳曾参观铁西工业区及鞍山、抚顺等钢铁工业，并学习了东北各工矿企业正在开展的“创造新纪录运动”。此次参观，帮助京市不少工厂解决了许多问题，建国铁工厂刘公君说：“看了鞍山所产的熟铁方锭，才知道中国是能生产这些原料的，回到北京一定改良机器，扩大营业。”宝丰铁工厂经理李温和，发现机械厂需要的工作母机，如牙轮、铣床、车床、电滚子、麻花钻头、钻石刀头等，东北各机械厂不但都能制造，而且特别精确。他说：“北京各铁工厂可以放心大胆的发展生产了，精确的工作母机是不会缺乏的！”
