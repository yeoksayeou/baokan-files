　　Hebei Province New District Cadre Meeting
　　Deploying Land Reform Work
　　Correcting Policies to Prevent Left and Right Deviations
　　[Baoding News] Hebei Province's new district held an expanded cadre meeting to deploy land reform work. Hebei Province was liberated entirely this year. There are 4,445 villages in the province that should undergo land reform (mainly in the Baoding, Tongxian, and Tangshan districts), of which 1,538 villages have not undergone land reform. In these areas, feudal forces still own a large amount of land. Although 2,853 villages have undergone land adjustment this year, landlords and rich peasants still occupy better land and means of production. Therefore, the broad masses of poor peasants urgently demand land reform. In order to meet the demands of the broad masses of poor peasants and correctly carry out land reform, the Baoding, Tongxian, and Tangshan districts successively held meetings of key county, district, and village cadres in early November. A total of 23,470 cadres attended the meetings, where they received policy education on land reform to improve their ideological level. Through this meeting, the remaining leftist ideas among the cadres were basically eliminated. Before the meeting, many cadres held a resistant attitude towards the current land reform policy, holding narrow views of poor peasants and farm laborers, believing that landlords were treated too leniently, and proposed "rather left than right" on the issue of uniting middle peasants; however, a few cadres were afraid of making mistakes and causing trouble, and had a "rather right than left" mentality. After more than ten days of repeated discussions by all cadres, introduction of old district land reform experience, and land reform policy education, the above-mentioned incorrect left and right leaning thoughts have been basically eliminated. The Baoding and Tangshan district meetings have ended, and the cadres have returned to their villages to carry out publicity on the land reform policy in conjunction with the autumn grain collection. In early December, all localities will be able to fully carry out land reform. In order to ensure that land reform is carried out effectively, the provincial party and government organs dispatched a working group of more than 900 people on the 14th to work in the Baoding, Tangshan, and Tongxian districts. They also instructed all localities to fully prepare for land reform, conscientiously publicize the land reform policy, eliminate remaining leftist thoughts, prevent right-leaning deviations, hold good peasant representative meetings, clearly explain the policies, appropriately allocate cadres, so that the leadership can promptly guide the movement to develop smoothly.

　　河北省新区干部集会
　　布置土地改革工作
　　端正政策防止左右倾偏向
    【保定讯】河北省新区召开扩大干部会议，布置土地改革工作。河北省全境于今年始获解放，全省应进行土地改革村庄（主要是保定、通县、唐山专区）共四千四百四十五村，其中未进行过土地改革的有一千五百三十八村，这些地区封建势力仍拥有大量土地。今年经过调剂土地的虽已有二千八百五十三村，但地主富农仍占有较好的土地和生产手段。因此，广大贫农迫切要求土地改革。为了满足广大贫农的要求及正确进行土地改革，保定、通县、唐山三个专区于本月上旬先后召开县区村主要干部会议，与会干部共二万三千四百七十人，会上进行了土地改革的政策教育，提高干部的思想水平。经过这次会议，基本上消除了干部中的左倾残余思想。会前不少干部对当前土地改革政策抱抵触的态度，存在着狭隘的贫雇农观点，认为对地主太宽了，对团结中农问题提出宁左勿右；但也有少数干部怕犯错误，怕找麻烦而有“宁右勿左”思想。上述不正确左右倾思想，经十余日全体干部的反复讨论，和老区土改经验介绍及土改政策教育后，基本上均已消除。保定唐山两专区会议已结束，干部已回村，结合秋征展开对土改政策的宣传。十二月初，各地即可全力进行土改。为使土地改革有力的进行，省党政机关于十四日派出九百余人的工作团，分赴保定、唐山、通县专区工作。并指示各地土改前充分作好准备工作，认真宣传土改政策，肃请左倾残余思想，防止右倾偏向，开好农民代表会，交代清政策，适当配备干部，使领导能及时指导运动顺利向前发展。
