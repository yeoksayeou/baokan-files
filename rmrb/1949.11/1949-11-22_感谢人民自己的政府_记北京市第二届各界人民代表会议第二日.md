　　Thanks to the People's Own Government
　　——A Record of the Second Day of the Second Beijing People's Representative Conference
　　Lin Hong
    Applause surged through the meeting hall like ocean waves, everyone's heart stirred, filled with boundless joy and pride. The sound of "Thanks to our people's own government, we support all the government's measures," echoed countless times through the loudspeakers to every person present. This was the voice of the four hundred and twenty-four Beijing People's Representatives, and also the words that two million Beijing citizens wanted to say from the bottom of their hearts!
    Why were the people so happy? Let's look at the discussion of Mayor Nie Rongzhen's work report at the Second Beijing People's Representative Conference to find out.
    More than three months ago, at the First Beijing People's Representative Conference, more than three hundred representatives passed over one hundred and seventy resolutions and handed them over to the municipal government for implementation. On the 20th of this month, the Second People's Representative Conference opened again, and many people naturally thought of the following question: How have these resolutions been handled? Mayor Nie's work report gave a clear answer to this question: By the end of October, all but seven of the one hundred and seventy-one resolutions had been implemented according to their priorities and urgency. The four hundred representatives were very satisfied with this answer, and they had already obtained this answer from the objective facts provided in the report. When the chairman of the conference announced the discussion of Mayor Nie's report, many representatives could not restrain their inner joy and submitted slips of paper requesting to speak to the podium. More than twenty people spoke in succession, including representatives from workers, farmers, students, education and culture circles, public security forces, women, industry and commerce, various democratic parties, and ethnic minorities. Everyone said in unison: The People's Government has carried out the will of the people of Beijing, we support her, we thank her!
    The first to step onto the podium was student representative Gu Qizong, who said excitedly: In just over two months, the municipal government has almost completely implemented the resolutions of the previous People's Representative Conference, which is a manifestation of the government being responsible to the people, and the more than 60,000 students in Beijing are very satisfied. Warm applause immediately broke out under the stage. Guan Zongyin, the deputy village chief of Bagou Village, was very young, with the inherent simplicity and sincerity of Chinese farmers. He said very gratefully: In the era of reactionary government rule, who ever made a work report to the common people? His words truly illustrated an unbreakable truth, and at the same time illustrated an earth-shattering change: the government belongs to the people, and having received the entrustment of the people, it must work for the people, and also report the results of its work to the people for everyone to inspect. This kind of thing is indeed very new to the newly liberated Chinese people, but from now on, it will become something that should be done and something that is done regularly. Then Yan Jici, a representative of the faculty and staff of various universities in Beijing, and Chen Mingde, general manager of Xinmin Daily, spoke, believing that the government had seriously done so many things for the people under the current circumstances of many difficulties in manpower and material resources, and they were very admirable and grateful. The government's assistance in completing the reform of the school system, helping to solve the tuition fees of private schools, and strengthening the education of out-of-school children and adults of workers, these few items in particular made them feel very satisfied. Tang Yongtong, director of the Peking University Affairs Committee, could not attend due to illness, but he felt that he had to speak, so he asked Professor Fan Hong to express his meaning to the conference on his behalf. He expressed his satisfaction with the government's implementation of 94% of the resolutions of the People's Representative Conference, and believed that the democratic scope of the Second People's Representative Conference had been further expanded, and that the people themselves electing their own mayor was something that had not happened in China for thousands of years.
    The speeches of worker representatives were warmly welcomed at the meeting, and representatives such as Song Fengxiang, Yang Kaiwen, Liu Zhendong, and Wang Wenbin, who had been promoted from worker to deputy factory director, took the stage one after another. They expressed their gratitude to the government for helping more than 10,000 workers' out-of-school children to attend school, guaranteeing workers' wages in kind through cooperatives, assisting workers in changing careers, and increasing medical rooms to protect workers' health.
    The words of a farmer representative surnamed Cao from the 14th district more fully demonstrated the suburban farmers' understanding of the People's Representative Conference and their trust in the People's Government. He said: When I first came to participate in the First People's Representative Conference, many fellow villagers asked me what I was going to do; but this time when I came, because many resolutions of the previous session had become a reality and solved many problems for the farmers, everyone asked me to represent them in expressing their gratitude to the government.
    While thanking the People's Government for so many brilliant achievements, the representatives also realized that the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries and consolidating social order in Beijing must be further completed, the production cause must be further restored and developed, and the people's own capital must be well built. Therefore, everyone unanimously expressed their support for the governance plan proposed by Mayor Nie and were willing to give their full support. Worker representative Yang Kaiwen said: In order to express our gratitude to the government, we workers must work harder and work desperately. Why? Because this is for the long-term interests of the Chinese nation and all mankind. Mayor Nie proposed three things to do in the future: first, the waterworks company should be nationalized in order to provide citizens with clean and cheap water, second, the sewers should be rectified, and third, environmental sanitation should be improved. Everyone expressed unanimous support because this is in line with the interests of the people.
    After the discussion of the work report was completed, all the representatives passed the proposal to close the brothels and reform the prostitutes in a tense and enthusiastic manner, and immediately handed it over to the municipal government for implementation. Then, the proposal for the municipal government to levy various donations and taxes was discussed. Deputy Mayor Zhang Youyu first explained it, and representatives from workers, farmers, industry and commerce and other units unanimously expressed their support. However, because it was late, this proposal was very important, and in order to allow the representatives to fully consider it, the presidium decided to continue the discussion on the 22nd.
    Before the adjournment, Comrade Peng Zhen appeared in front of the loudspeaker and said: Just now, Mayor Nie and I went to report to Chairman Mao on the resolutions of the conference yesterday on the grain issue and today on the prostitute issue. Chairman Mao said: It is very good to do so. He also gave us instructions on stabilizing prices. At this time, lasting applause and slogans of long live Chairman Mao rang out under the stage, and everyone unanimously thanked Chairman Mao for his concern for the two million citizens!

　　感谢人民自己的政府
　　——记北京市第二届各界人民代表会议第二日
　　林洪
    掌声象海涛一般一阵一阵地泛过会场，每个人的心激动着，充满了无限的喜悦和骄傲之感，“感谢我们人民自己的政府，拥护政府的一切措施”的声音，无数次地经过扩音器传到每一位在座的人的耳里，这是四百二十四位北京市人民代表的声音，也是北京二百万市民内心里要说的话！
    人民为什么这样高兴呢？让我们看看北京市第二届各界人民代表会议讨论聂荣臻市长施政报告的情形，就会知道了。
    三个多月以前，在本市第一届各界人民代表会议上，三百多位代表通过了一百七十余件议案，交给市政府办理。本月二十日第二届各界人民代表会议又开幕了，许多人自然地想到这样一个问题：这一些决议案到底办得怎么样了？聂市长的施政报告对这一个问题作了明确的回答：一百七十一件决议案到十月底止，除七件外，都已按先后缓急分别执行了。四百多位代表对这一答复十分满意，他们也已经从报告所提供的客观事实中得到了这个回答。当大会主席宣布讨论聂市长的报告时，许多代表都抑制不住内心的喜悦，纷纷将要求发言的纸条递上主席台。先后登台发言的有二十余人，包括工、农、学生、教育文化界、公安部队、妇女、工商界、各民主党派及少数民族的代表，大家异口同声地说：人民政府执行了我们北京人民的意志，我们拥护她，感谢她！
    首先登上讲台的是学生代表古奇踪，他激动地说：在短短的两个多月内，市政府几乎完全执行了上届各界人民代表会议的决议案，这是政府对人民负责的表现，我们北京市的六万多学生认为非常满意。台下立刻响起了热烈的掌声。管宗印是巴沟村的副村长，年纪很青，带着中国农民固有的朴实诚恳的表情，他十分感激地说：在反动政府统治的时代，谁向老百姓作过施政报告？他的话确实说明了一个牢不可破的真理，同时也说明了一个翻天覆地的转变：政府是人民的，受了人民的嘱托，就要为人民作事，而且还要把作事的结果报告给人民，让大家来检查。这种事情对于新解放的中国人民确是十分新鲜的，但是从今以后，它就要变成应该的和经常的了。接着有北京各院校教职员代表严济慈、新民报总经理陈铭德代表发言，认为政府在今天人力物力诸多困难的情形下，认真地替人民作了这许多事，十分敬佩和感谢。政府协助完成学制的改革，帮助解决私立学校的学费，加强了工人失学子弟和成人的教育，这几项，尤其使他们感到十分满意。北京大学校务委员会主任汤用彤代表因病不能出席，但他觉得不能不说话，于是便请樊弘教授代为向大会表达了他的意思，他对政府执行了各界代表会议百分之九十四的议决案表示十分满意，并且认为第二届各界人民代表会议的民主范围更加扩大了，人民自己选举自己的市长，是中国几千年来所没有的事。
    工人代表的发言得到会场的热烈欢迎，先后登台的有宋凤祥、杨开文、刘振东及由工人升为副厂长的王文彬等代表。他们对政府帮助一万多工人失学子弟上学、通过合作社保证工人的实物工资，协助工人转业和增设医疗室保护工人健康等措施表示十分感谢。
    十四区一位姓曹的农民代表的话，更充分地表明了郊区农民对各界代表会议的认识和对人民政府的信任。他说：当第一次我来参加第一届各界人民代表会时，好些老乡都问我去干什么的；但这一次我来时，因为上届的许多决议都变成了事实，为农民解决了许多问题，大家便纷纷要我代表他们向政府表示谢意。
    代表们一方面感谢人民政府这许多辉煌的成绩，同时也认识到北京市的镇压反革命巩固社会秩序的工作必须进一步完成，生产事业必须进一步恢复与发展，必须很好地建设人民自己的首都，因此大家一致表示拥护聂市长提出的施政计划，愿意全力支持。工人代表杨开文说：为了表示对政府的感谢，我们工人要加倍的干、拼命的干。为什么？因为这是为了中华民族和全人类长远的利益。聂市长提出今后要作的三件事：第一自来水公司收归国营，以便供给市民清洁和价廉的水，第二整顿下水道，第三改善环境卫生，大家都表示一致拥护，因为这是符合于人民利益的。
    施政报告讨论完毕后，全体代表紧张热烈地通过了封闭妓院改造妓女的议案，并立即交付市政府执行。接着讨论市政府提出的征收各种捐税提案。张友渔副市长首先加以解释，工人、农民、工商界等单位的代表一致表示拥护。但因时间已晚，这一提案又十分重要，为了让代表们能充分地考虑，主席团决定二十二日再继续讨论。
    临散会前，彭真同志出现在扩音器前，他说：刚才我和聂市长一同去向毛主席报告了大会昨天对粮食问题和今天对妓女问题的决议。毛主席说：这样作很好。他并且给了我们关于稳定物价的指示。这时台下立刻响起了经久不息的掌声和毛主席万岁的口号声，大家一致感谢毛主席对二百万市民的关怀！
