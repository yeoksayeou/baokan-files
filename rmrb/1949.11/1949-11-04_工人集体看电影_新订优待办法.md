　　Workers Watching Movies Collectively
  　Newly Revised Preferential Measures
    [Reported by this newspaper] In order to strengthen film education for workers, the Propaganda and Education Department of the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions has reached an agreement with the North China Film Management Company and the Cinema Association to implement preferential measures for workers watching movies collectively: Any factory or industry workers who gather a group of ten people can obtain a unified letter of introduction issued by the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions from their affiliated trade union, and enjoy a half-price discount when going to various cinemas to watch movies. However, this is limited to films produced by the Soviet Union and the Northeast Film Studio. (Hou Dacheng)
