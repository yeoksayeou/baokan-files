　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 27th. TASS Moscow dispatch: The Pravda published on the 26th an article by Marshal Choibalsan, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Mongolian People's Republic, commemorating the 25th anniversary of the Mongolian People's Republic, entitled "The Mongolian People on the Road to Socialism." The article stated: Thanks to the great and decisive assistance of the great Russian people, the Mongolian people won freedom for the first time in history in 1921. The genius leaders of the working people, Lenin and Stalin, helped the Mongolian people throw off the shackles of imperialism and pointed out the only correct path to build a free and happy life hand in hand with the victorious Soviet Russian proletariat. On November 26, 1924, the First People's Khural (understood as the Supreme People's Assembly) of Mongolia adopted the first constitution and announced the establishment of the Mongolian People's Republic. In the course of twenty-five years, the Mongolian people have skipped the stage of capitalist development from feudalism and medieval systems and transitioned to socialism, and have made remarkable achievements. These achievements vividly demonstrate the strength and vitality of the people's democratic order established in the country. Marshal Choibalsan went on to discuss the achievements of the Mongolian People's Republic in the development of livestock breeding, railway transportation and culture. He also pointed out: The Mongolian people fully appreciate the greatness of the friendship between the Mongolian and Soviet peoples, and realize that the Soviet Union is safeguarding the vital interests of the small and oppressed peoples. The Mongolian people now and in the future will always unswervingly support the Soviet Union's peace-loving policy and firmly support the democratic and socialist camp.
