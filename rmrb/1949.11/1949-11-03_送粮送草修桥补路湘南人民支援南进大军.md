Xinhua News Agency, Hunan Front, 2nd: The people's guerrilla forces and the broad masses of people in southern and southwestern Hunan are enthusiastically supporting the army's continued advance in pursuing and annihilating fleeing bandits. After the people's guerrilla forces who persisted in fighting the enemy behind enemy lines in the Xuefeng Mountains area victoriously joined forces with the People's Liberation Army Fourth Field Army's southward advance troops, they immediately worked day and night with the broad masses of people in the area to send grain, send grass, repair bridges, and repair roads, and immediately took on the task of maintaining law and order in the newly liberated areas of Chenxi, Xupu, and other places. When the main force advanced to the rugged terrain of southern Hunan, the people's guerrilla forces in southern Hunan led the local people in repairing roads day and night, building four pontoon bridges in five days, and concentrating more than forty civilian boats, so that the main force of the troops could cross the river in time and complete the task of blocking the enemy. Before the Bai Chongxi bandit army fled from Hengyang, it attempted to plunder the people's grain in southern Hunan and transport it to Guangxi. The bandit army forced the peasants to hand over grain with bayonets, and ordered the people of various places to flee with the bandit army, implementing the so-called "scorched earth" policy, but the people of various places used coping and delaying methods to fight the bandit army, hiding the grain secretly, waiting for the arrival of the People's Liberation Army; when the People's Liberation Army arrived, they immediately took out the collected grain and sent it to the troops. The people of places like Shitangwan and Mashiping, because the roads were too slippery due to rain, put rice straw along the road for the People's Liberation Army who were advancing in the rain, and some built bridges with wooden boards to facilitate the rapid pursuit and annihilation of the fleeing bandits by the army. The thirteen households in Cangjiang Bridge village, north of the Xiang-Gui Railway southwest of Hengyang, mobilized their entire families to help the People's Liberation Army grind more than 1,000 catties of rice. When a unit of the People's Liberation Army was chasing and attacking fleeing bandits in the Jiangjia Xinwu area, the local male and female farmers braved great danger to carry boiled water, sweet potatoes, and eggs to comfort the commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army. Yu Zhongsheng and Li Yussen, farmers from Yanggu Village, carried the wounded People's Liberation Army soldiers Deng Xianfang and Wang Enbo home in the midst of the artillery fire and hid them in the cattle pen. Although they were tortured in every possible way by the bandit army, they never revealed a word; afterwards, they personally sent the wounded soldiers back to their original units. In the Huangdipu and Baidishi areas, after the People's Liberation Army annihilated four divisions of Bai bandits' main force, the farmers spontaneously organized themselves to assist the People's Liberation Army in searching for the remnants of the bandits who had fled and scattered in the mountains.

　　送粮送草修桥补路湘南人民支援南进大军
    【新华社湖南前线二日电】湘南和湘西南的人民游击队和广大人民，热烈支援大军继续前进，追歼逃匪。坚持雪峰山地区敌后斗争的人民游击队和人民解放军第四野战军南下大军胜利会师后，立即和该地区广大人民一起日夜送粮、送草、修桥、补路，并即担负起辰溪、溆浦等新解放地区的治安任务。大军进抵湘南地势崎岖地区时，湘南人民游击队带领该地人民夜以继日地抢修道路，五天中搭建浮桥四座，并集中民船四十余只，使部队主力及时渡河，完成堵击敌人的任务。白崇禧匪军从衡阳溃逃以前，曾企图将湘南人民粮食搜括运往广西。匪军用刺刀强迫农民交粮，并命令各地人民随匪军逃亡，实行所谓“空室清野”，但各地人民都用应付和拖延的方法与匪军进行斗争，把粮食暗藏起来，等待解放军的到来；当解放军到达后，便马上把收藏的粮食拿出来送到部队去。石塘湾和马石坪等地的人民，因下雨道路太滑，就为冒雨前进的解放军沿途放上稻草，有的用木板搭桥，便利大军迅速追歼逃匪。衡阳西南湘桂铁路以北的沧江桥全村十三户人家全体动员，帮助解放军碾米一千多斤。解放军某部在姜家新屋一带追击逃匪时，该地男女农民冒了极大的危险抬着开水、白薯和鸡蛋前来慰劳解放军的指战员们。阳古村农民禹仲生和李雨森在炮火中将受伤的解放军战士邓先芳、王恩波背回家中隐藏在牛栏里，虽遭匪军百般拷打，始终未吐露一字；事后并亲自将受伤战士送回原来部队。在黄地铺，白地市一带农民，当人民解放军消灭白匪主力四个师后，更自动组织起来协助解放军搜捕逃散在山中的残匪。
