　　The Philippine People in Hard Struggle
　　Interview with Philippine Workers' Representative Shen Tiansheng
　　Chen Qingmei
　　On the fourth day of the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference (November 19th), the meeting adjourned very late. By the time the representatives from various countries returned to the hostel to rest, it was already 8:00 PM. Just as Philippine representative Shen Tiansheng had settled down, a group of journalists from our capital knocked on his door, asking him to introduce the situation of the Philippine working people and their living conditions to Chinese workers.

　　This was simply unimaginable in Manila. Because, if they did so, the constables and police officers of Manila might have already entered before us; however, today Representative Shen has arrived in the free land of the new China, and at the same time, the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference concerning the future of the Eastern proletariat's struggle is being held here, so what is following them is no longer the shadow of imperialism, and he has gained the support of his broad class brothers!

　　Representative Shen, without showing any fatigue, talked to the journalists about the difficult situation of the Philippine workers, farmers, and overseas Chinese compatriots, as well as the heroic resistance they have recently carried out against American imperialism and its running dogs.

　　　　1. Archipelago of Hunger and Poverty

　　Post-war Philippines has become a place of hunger and poverty. According to official Philippine statistics in 1947, out of a national population of 19 million, there were 1.4 million unemployed, of which 150,000 were in the Manila area alone. On October 24th this year, the Electric News Agency dispatched a report from Manila, stating that the number of unemployed people in the Philippines had increased from 1.4 million in 1947 to 2 million! The report also quoted a statement by Hainan Te, Chairman of the Philippine Labor Organization Congress, regarding the causes of unemployment. He said: "This is a byproduct of American economic policy. The Philippines needs machines, tractors, and industrial equipment, but Washington is talking about transporting weapons and ammunition to slaughter farmers. Consumer goods are also being dumped into the Philippines, strangling local industries. The Philippines is bound by pre-war agreements that make it a source of raw materials. We sell raw materials at prices stipulated by the United States and buy back finished products at American prices, which explains the unemployment and poverty of the Philippine people!"

　　Another specific figure also illustrates the fact that Wall Street bosses are relentlessly exploiting the blood and sweat of the Philippine people: In the thirty years from 1903 to 1933, the area of arable land in the Philippines increased fourfold, but the vast undeveloped tropical fertile land was not used to grow rice, which is necessary for people's lives. In the agricultural production sector during these thirty years, sugar production increased sevenfold, coconuts increased ninefold, tobacco increased threefold, and rice increased fourfold. These sugar, coconuts, and other products were continuously transported to the United States, while rice needed to be imported in large quantities, and its imports increased more than thirtyfold. From this, it can be seen who is causing the famine in the Philippines! The Philippine national economy is being developed entirely according to the wishes of its colonial masters.

　　Precisely because of the insatiable exploitation of the Philippine people by American imperialists, urban workers and agricultural workers have had their last drop of blood sucked away. Look at the comparison between the cost of living and wage income of Philippine workers: After the war, the Philippine government stipulated a basic daily wage of 1.25 pesos, and the income of general workers, including allowances, was less than 2 pesos per day. This wage refers to the Manila area, and it is even lower in other places. It is slightly higher than the basic wage before the war. However, prices after the war have increased tenfold compared to before the war, and the minimum living expenses for a family of three is 7 pesos per day!

　　Therefore, between 1946 and 1947, organized workers throughout the Philippines, under the leadership of the Labor Congress, launched a fierce economic struggle. As a result, they forced the reactionary government to raise the wage base to four pesos (including allowances). Even so, workers still lived half-starved lives. More seriously, the wage increase implemented by the Philippine government was limited only to organized urban workers. Those millions of agricultural workers and other unorganized workers still earned only one to two pesos a day, which was barely enough to feed themselves, let alone support their families!

　　　　2. Philippine Workers Suffering from Persecution

　　Because society itself is composed of a thorough colonial economy, the Philippines has no heavy industry, and the number of workers is not large. According to statistics, there are about 1.5 million workers nationwide, and they are not yet universally organized. The Philippine Labor Organization Congress, which is now a member of the World Federation of Trade Unions, is the real organization of the Philippine working class. It has 100,000 members. The National Peasants' Federation, which was declared illegal by the Philippine government in 1946, has 300,000 farmers as its members. As for the "National Federation of Trade Unions," this organization has always been a yellow trade union used by Philippine and American reactionaries. In coordination with labor traitors and police agents, it specializes in deceiving and splitting the working class. Although it claims to have 300,000 members, it actually has no mass base.

　　Before 1929, the Philippine workers' organization had a "Philippine General Labor Union," which at that time participated in the Secretariat of the Pan-Pacific Trade Union (an organ under the Red Trade Union International). In 1929, an ideological struggle between the left and right factions occurred within the union. As a result, the left wing formed the "Philippine General Labor Union of the Proletariat" and participated in the Second Pan-Pacific Trade Union Conference held in Vladivostok in 1929. Since then, it has maintained close contact with the international working class and continued to fight for the interests of Philippine workers. Until 1942, when Japan occupied the Philippine Islands, the organization shifted to rural areas and merged with the "National Peasants' Federation," which led the peasants, to jointly organize the "People's Anti-Japanese Army" and launch extensive guerrilla activities behind enemy lines. After Japan's surrender, the "Labor Organization Congress" was established. In a new form, it continued to lead the Philippine working class in fighting to defend the interests of its own class and national independence and liberation.

　　Although the Philippine reactionaries superficially granted the "Labor Organization Congress" legal status, in reality, under the direction of American imperialism, they are carrying out extremely sinister and vicious methods to sabotage the organization of the Labor Congress. The Quirino government imitated the tricks of its Wall Street masters and also organized the "Committee to Investigate Non-Philippine Activities," frequently shamelessly summoning the leaders of the Philippine Communist Party and the Labor Congress for interrogation, and using the despicable act of assassination by secret agents. In January 1948, it murdered Qiu Wen, the Secretary-General of the Labor Congress. In January of this year, Cabadoosia, the Vice-Chairman of the Labor Congress, was also attacked by secret agents at home, but fortunately, he was not hit. This kind of secret agent activity is carried out entirely with the tacit approval and connivance of the reactionary government, and is now widespread. This precisely shows that the Philippines, just like the United States, is moving towards the path of fascism!

　　　　3. Chinese and Philippine Workers are One Family

　　Speaking of this, Representative Shen mentioned the solidarity and friendship between Filipino and Chinese workers.

　　Filipino and Chinese workers have maintained close organizational ties and unified action since 1928. From that year on, both sides began to jointly fight for the goal of equal pay for Filipino and Chinese workers. This action started with workers in lumber mills and slipper factories. In 1929, the "Philippine General Labor Union of the Proletariat" was established, and the Chinese Overseas General Labor Union joined the union as a group member. Since then, both sides have cooperated closely in organized factories. The Philippines established the Labor Organization Congress, and the "United Federation of Chinese Overseas Labor Groups" also joined the Labor Organization Congress as a group member. For the past twenty years, Filipino and Chinese workers have helped each other economically and politically. Since 1942, Chinese and Philippine people have fought side by side against the Japanese invaders. Cadres of the "Philippine General Labor Union of the Proletariat" and cadres of the "Chinese Overseas Labor Federation" jointly led the "People's Anti-Japanese Army" to resist the common enemy of the working class—Japanese imperialism. Therefore, they have shared life and death and are as close as brothers.

　　After 1946, because Philippine workers gained victories in economic struggles, the American and Philippine reactionaries became fearful. At this time, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang also shamelessly colluded with them, persecuting local Chinese overseas workers and patriotic elements as a three-in-one force, and preparing to further destroy the Philippine workers' movement and people's strength. Under their high-pressure tactics, the "Chinese Overseas Labor Federation" has been unable to exist publicly since 1947. The American and Philippine reactionaries adopted a set of measures against Chinese overseas workers and their leaders, such as "legal appeals," arrests by constables and police officers, secret executions, and publicly forced repatriation to hand them over to the Chiang bandit gang, strengthening their persecution policies. On September 7, 1946, Wang Jiawai, the leader of Chinese workers in Central Luzon, was illegally arrested by local constables and police officers and soon secretly executed by them. In August 1947, five Chinese workers' leaders were sentenced by the reactionary court to be forcibly repatriated to China. As for the persecution of general Chinese workers, that was even more commonplace. The decree of deportation seriously threatened overseas Chinese, and the shameless Kuomintang bandit gang used this as bankrupt political capital to intensify the oppression of patriotic overseas compatriots. For example, after the establishment of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China on October 1st this year, the Chiang bandit colluded with American imperialist running dogs to search fifty shops opened by overseas Chinese in Manila within half a month. But Chiang Kai-shek's fate is awaiting the American imperialists and Quirino's dog lackeys!

　　　　4. The Growth of the Philippine People's Armed Forces - The People's Anti-Japanese Army

　　Representative Shen also spoke about the heroic resistance of the Philippine "People's Anti-Japanese Army" against American imperialism and Quirino's joint "suppression" after Japan's surrender.

　　When the American military suffered defeat in the Philippines in January 1942, the Japanese army came to rule the entire island on behalf of American imperialism. In March, cadres of the "Philippine National Peasants' Federation" and the "General Labor Union of the Proletariat" who had withdrawn from the cities jointly established the Philippine People's Anti-Japanese Armed Forces, using weapons abandoned by the American army on the battlefield to arm themselves. They launched extensive guerrilla warfare on the plains of Central Luzon and persisted until Japan's surrender. When the American army attacked Manila, the People's Anti-Japanese Army cooperated with the American army in combat behind enemy lines and put in great effort. But after the American army occupied Manila, it disarmed all the "People's Anti-Japanese Army" soldiers who had contributed to the anti-Japanese war. The American military authorities instigated the reactionary Philippine armed forces to demobilize this group of people and return them to farming. All the unarmed "People's Anti-Japanese Army" soldiers were killed on the way. Afterwards, the American reactionaries once again arrested Qin Luoke, the commander-in-chief of the "People's Anti-Japanese Army," and his deputy commander, Kasidao, on the pretext. Only after demonstrations and protests by 100,000 workers and farmers throughout the Philippines did the reactionaries release them.

　　These two incidents profoundly educated the Philippine people that imperialism will never automatically withdraw from the Philippines. From June 1946, Roxas openly conducted armed "encirclement and suppression" against the People's Anti-Japanese Army. On the plains of Central Luzon, they brutally massacred innocent farmers and often burned down entire villages. This forced the people's armed forces, which had already been disbanded, to take up arms again and fight against the reactionary army. This just act of self-defense immediately won the support of the vast number of farmers and agricultural workers, who joined the guerrilla ranks one after another. After the chairman of the National Peasants' Federation, Joan Ferrio, was tragically murdered at the end of 1946, the armed struggle of the "People's Anti-Japanese Army" became even more widespread! The combat areas have expanded from Central Luzon to North and South Luzon and the Misaya Islands. The guerrillas implemented a land policy of rent reduction and interest reduction in rural areas, which won the support of the vast number of farmers.

　　Now, the American and Philippine military authorities are doing everything they can to eliminate this Philippine people's armed force, but the heroic "People's Anti-Japanese Army" is growing stronger in the flames of national liberation. They have been encouraged by the great victory of the Chinese people. A bright tomorrow is waiting for them. The Philippine people are not isolated in their struggle against American imperialism and its running dog Quirino!

　　苦斗中的菲律宾人民
　　访问菲律宾工人代表沈天生
　　陈庆楣
    亚澳工会会议的第四天（十九日）大会散得很晚，各国代表们回到招待所休息的时候已是是夜里八点钟了。当菲律宾代表沈天生刚安顿下来的片刻，我们首都的一群新闻记者就敲门而入，请他把菲律宾劳动人民的处境和他们的生活情形介绍给中国工人。
    这在马尼剌简直是一件不可想象的事。因为，如果这样做，马尼剌的宪警先生们可能早已先我们而入了；但是，今天沈代表已到了新中国首都的自由土地上，同时，在这里正在举行着有关东方无产阶级斗争前途的亚澳工会会议，因此跟在他们背后的已不再是帝国主义的魔影了，他已经得到了广大的阶级弟兄的支持！
    沈代表毫无倦色地和记者们谈起菲律宾的工人、农民和华侨同胞们的艰苦处境，以及近来他们向美帝国主义及其走狗所进行英勇反抗的史实。
    　　　　一、饥饿和贫困的群岛
    战后的菲律宾，已经成了饥饿和贫困的地方。据一九四七年菲岛官方的统计，全国一千九百万人口中，失业人数有一百四十万，其中光是马尼剌地区就占了十五万人。今年十月二十四日，电通社从马尼剌拍发了一段报导，中间说到菲律宾的失业人数已从一九四七年的一百四十万人增加到二百万人！电讯中又引述了菲律宾劳工组织大会主席海南特对造成失业原因的一段谈话。他说：“这乃是美国经济政策的副产物。菲律宾需要机器、拖拉机及工业设备，但华盛顿则在谈论着运送武器、弹药来屠杀农民。消费品也向菲律宾大事倾销，绞杀了本地的工业，菲律宾被束缚于使它成为原料供给地的战前协议。我们按照美国规定的价格出售原料，而又按照美国的价格购回制成品，这就说明了菲律宾人民失业和贫困的原因！”
    另一个具体的数字也说明了华尔街的老板们尽情榨取菲岛人民血汗的事实：从一九○三年到一九三三年的三十年中，菲律宾可耕土地的面积增加了四倍，但广大未开辟的热带沃土并本用来种植人民生活所必需的食米。在这三十年内农业生产方面，糖的产量增加了七倍，椰子增加了九倍，烟叶增加了三倍，食米增加了四倍，这些糖、椰子等产品都源源地运往美国，而食米却需大量从外地输入，它的进口量竟增加了三十倍以上。从此可以看出谁在造成菲律宾的饥荒！菲律宾的国民经济是完全依照殖民地主子们的愿望来发展的。
    正由于美帝国主义者对菲律宾人民所进行无餍止的榨取，城市工人和农业工人已被他们吮吸去最后的一滴血。请看看菲律宾工人的生活费用和工资收入的对比吧：战后，菲律宾政府规定了每天的基本工资为一·二五元，一般工人每天连津贴在内，收入不到二元。这一工资是指马尼剌地区而言的，别的地方比这个标准还要低。它比战前的基本工资略为加了一些。可是，战后的物价却比战前提高了十倍，三口之家的最低生活费每天需菲币七元！
    因此，在一九四六到四七年之间，全菲有组织的工人，在劳工大会领导下，展开了剧烈的经济斗争。结果，逼使反动政府把工资基数提高到四元（连津贴在内）。就这样，工人还是过着半饱的生活。更严重的是菲政府提高的工资范围只局限于有组织的城市工人中，那些数以百万计的广大农业工人和其他尚未组织起来的工人，仍旧每天拿着一元到二元的工资，连他们自身也难以＠口，更谈不上养家了！
    　　　　二、受尽迫害的菲岛工人
    由于社会本身是由彻底的殖民地经济所组成，菲律宾没有重工业，工人的数目也不多，据统计全国约有一百五十万人，而且还没有普遍组织起来，其中六十万的现代工人大多为交通工人。现为世界工联会员的菲律宾劳工组织大会是菲岛工人阶级真正的自己组织。它拥有会员十万人。一九四六年被菲律宾政府宣布为非法的全国农民联合会，有三十万农民作为它的会员。至于“全国各工会联合会”这个组织，一向是菲美反动派所御用的黄色工会，在工贼们和宪警特务的配合下，专做欺骗和分裂工人阶级的勾当，虽然它号称有三十万会员，但实际上没有群众基础。
    菲律宾工人组织在一九二九年以前，有一个“菲律宾总工会”，当时参加了泛太平洋职工会秘书处（赤色职工国际属下的一个机关）。一九二九年，该会内部发生了左右两派的思想斗争，结果左派的另组“菲律宾无产阶级总会”，并参加了一九二九年在海参崴召开的第二次泛太平洋职工会议，此后，它一直与国际工人阶级保持密切联系并继续为菲律宾工人利益而斗争。直到一九四二年日本侵占菲律宾群岛，该组织就向农村转移，与领导农民的“全国农民联合会”汇合，共同组织“民抗军”在敌后展开广泛的游击活动。日本投降后，成立了“劳工组织大会”，在新的形式下，它继续领导菲律宾的工人阶级为保卫本阶级的利益和民族的独立解放而进行斗争。
    菲律宾反动派在表面上虽然给了“劳工组织大会”以合法地位，但实际在美帝的指使下，他们正进行着极其阴狠恶毒的手段去破坏劳工大会的组织。季里诺政府仿效了华尔街主子的伎俩，也组织了“非菲活动调查委员会”，经常无耻地传审菲共和劳工大会的领袖们，并运用了特务暗杀的卑鄙行为，于一九四八年一月把劳工大会秘书长裘文杀害了。今年正月里，劳工大会副主席卡巴道西亚也在家里遭特务狙击，幸未被命中。这种特务活动完全在反动政府默许和纵容之下进行的，现在普及各地。这正表明了菲律宾和美国一模一样，正走向法西斯的道路上去！
    　　　　三、中菲工人是一家
    谈到这里，沈代表提起了菲工和华工之间的团结友爱的情形。
    菲工和华工自从一九二八年起始终在组织上保持紧密的联系和行动上的团结一致。从那一年起，双方就开始为争取菲工华工同工同酬这个目标而联合斗争。这一行动先从木厂和拖鞋厂的工人中开端。一九二九年，“菲律宾无产阶级总会”成立，华侨总工会就加入该会成为团体会员。此后，在有组织的工厂里，双方都紧紧合作。菲律宾成立了劳工组织大会，“华侨各劳工团体联合会”也加入了劳工组织大会为团体会员。二十年来，菲华工人之间在经济上政治上都互相帮助，在一九四二年起华侨和菲律宾的人民曾经并肩与日本侵略者作战，“菲律宾无产阶级总会”的干部和“华侨劳联会”的干部共同领导了“民抗军”反抗工人阶级的共同敌人——日本帝国主义，因此他们之间共过生死，亲如兄弟。
    到了一九四六年以后，由于菲律宾工人在经济斗争中获得了胜利，美、菲的反动派们都恐惧起来。这时蒋介石匪帮也无耻地勾结他们，三位一体迫害当地华侨工人、爱国分子，并准备进一步来摧残菲律宾的工人运动和人民力量。在他们的高压下，“华侨劳联会”从一九四七年起就无法公开存在了。美菲反动派们对华侨工人和其领袖采取了“法律抗告”，宪警逮捕，秘密处死，和公开强迫遣送回国引渡给蒋匪帮等一套手段，加强他们的迫害政策。一九四六年九月七日，中吕宋的华工领袖王家外被当地的宪警非法拘捕，不久，就被他们秘密处死。一九四七年八月里，有五个华工领袖被反动法庭判处强迫遣返中国。至于对待一般华工的迫害，那更为司空见惯了。驱逐出境的法令严重地威胁着华侨，而无耻的国民党匪帮反利用这一点作为破了产的政治资本，加紧压迫爱国的侨胞。比如今年十月一日中华人民共和国中央人民政府成立以后，蒋匪就勾通美帝走狗们在半月之内，一连在马尼剌搜查了五十家华侨开设的商店。但是蒋介石的命运正在等待着美帝国主义和季里诺狗徒们！
    　　　　四、菲岛人民武装——民抗军的成长
    沈代表又谈到了菲律宾“民抗军”在日本投降以后英勇地反抗美帝国主义和季里诺会同“进剿”的顽强斗争。
    当一九四二年一月，美国在菲律宾的军事遭到失败后，日本军队就替代表美帝国主义来统治全岛。三月里，由“菲律宾全国农民联合会”和从城市撤出的“无产阶级总会”的干部联合建立了菲岛人民抗日武装“人民抗日军”，他们以美国军队在战场上丢掉的武器来武装自己。在中吕宋的平原上展开了广泛的游击战争，一直坚持日本投降。当美军攻入马尼剌时，民抗军在敌后配合美军作战，化了很大力气。但美军占领马尼剌以后，把一大队抗日有功的“民抗军”全部缴械。美国军事当局并嗾使菲律宾的反动武装把这一批人解甲归田，手无寸铁的“民抗军”战士们全数在途中被杀害了。之后，美国反动派又一度借故逮捕了“民抗军”总司令秦洛克和副司令卡司道二人。经过全菲十万工农群众的示威抗议，反动派才把他们释放出来。
    这两件事变深刻地教育了菲律宾的人民，帝国主义是决不会自动退出菲律宾的。一九四六年六月起，罗哈斯公开对民抗军进行武装“围剿”，在中吕宋的平上原，他们残酷地屠杀无辜农民，常常烧毁整个村庄。这样就迫使原已解散了的人民武装重新拿起武器，与反动军队作战。这一正义的自卫行为，立刻获得广大农民和农业工人的拥护，他们纷纷加入了游击队的队伍。一九四六年年底，全国农民联合会主席琼·费里奥惨遭杀害后，“民抗军”的武装斗争就更加广泛了！战斗地区已从中吕宋扩大到南北吕宋和米赛亚群岛，游击队在农村实行减租减息的土地政策，得到了广大农民的拥护。
    现在，美菲的军事当局竭力想法要消灭这支菲律宾的人民武装，但英勇的“民抗军”正在民族解放的战火里壮大起来，他们已得到了中国人民伟大胜利的鼓舞，光辉的明天正在等待着他们，菲律宾人民在和美帝国主义及其走狗季里诺的斗争中，并不是孤立的！
