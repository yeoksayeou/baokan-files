　　Children's Paradise
    ——A Visit to the Beihai Experimental Nursery
    Bo Sheng
    Walking along the riverbank towards the back gate of Beihai, almost to the end, you see a red temple-like building, which is the Can Tan – the experimental nursery run by the Beijing Municipal Party Committee.
    The early winter sun warmly shines on the children's faces. In the courtyard, groups of children in red and blue clothes are happily playing, singing, and shouting.
    Two childcare workers – the children's aunties – took me to see the children and visit their bedrooms, activity rooms, and bathrooms. The seventy-four children's lives are managed in four classes: the small class for children aged two to two and a half, the middle class (with two groups) for children aged two and a half to three and a half, and the large class for children aged three and a half to five.
    We went to see the small class first. The children were already wearing red floral-patterned cotton-padded jackets, looking like little red balls. They were not yet walking steadily. Some were pushing toy cars, or moving building blocks, while others were gathered around the aunties, hugging their legs and calling out. This smallest group was particularly innocent and adorable.
    The middle class children were gluing leaves to make airplanes. They were all wearing purple-red overalls and padded trousers. Some were patiently learning from the aunties using the leaf airplane models that had been prepared for them. Some children had quickly finished gluing and were waiting for the aunties to take everyone to the yard to play together.
    In the yard, the large class children were doing outdoor activities. Some were playing on the seesaw, some were playing on the slide, and others were swinging on the swings.
    The children's several bedrooms were all tidied up very neatly. Rows of small beds were covered with white small sheets and red and blue small felt blankets. Next to the bedrooms were the activity rooms, with small wooden tables, small wooden chairs, building blocks, sandboxes, and also pictures and toy cars... Many indoor game toys for the children. In the bathroom, each child had a fixed place to wash their face, with their small washbasin and towel. Because the children could not yet recognize their own names, all the children's names were represented by drawn animal and plant symbols. Every morning, each child could find their washing place according to the symbol. Several children could take a bath in the bathtub at the same time. Everything was arranged very neatly.

　　　　Children's Lives
    After the children enter the nursery, they get up at seven o'clock every day. The older children wash their faces, make their beds, raise the flag, and distribute food themselves. The middle class children are helped by the aunties. After breakfast, the children have indoor activities at eight o'clock. The older and middle classes have lessons, learning to sing and doing group games. The small class is taken by the aunties to play with building blocks and sand, learn to do the Yangko dance and sing nursery rhymes indoors or outdoors. But the children are active, they love new things, like to imitate, are curious, and like to run around in the garden. They often come into contact with the workers in the garden, watching others plant vegetables, pull weeds, and carry water. The children warmly call the workers "Uncle!" and squat there or follow the workers closely watching the labor operations. The workers also love to watch these children. One worker made a song for the children – "Autumn is here, the weather is good, Uncle plants vegetables, I pull weeds, Auntie says I'm a good baby." The children sing it in their mouths from time to time. Sometimes the aunties also take them to Beihai Park for a trip, or out of the city to see some natural scenery, so that the children can broaden their horizons.
    Whenever it is mealtime, the children wait until everyone is seated before eating. The children have developed the habit of not being picky eaters. The older children serve their own rice and take their own bowls. The middle class children also learn to do it themselves. Because the small class children are not yet good at speaking and walking, the aunties help them at any time. Sometimes, if the children accidentally fight over toys, the aunties always let them solve it themselves if there is no danger. Similarly, the older children are often willing to help the younger and middle class children solve some difficulties in life. Every time the nursery gives vaccinations, the older children always bravely stand at the front to set an example.
    In life, especially when playing in groups, children often like to do familiar activities from their own life experiences, connecting some disjointed things together, compiling them into stories, and imitating them. When the children are playing "moving house" or "playing house" or "watching dolls," if you observe carefully, you will find what a beautiful and vivid story creation it is! Once, the child of a mother working in a radio station and the child of a father working in an art troupe, together with several children of parents working in factories, played "playing house," "watching dolls," and "moving house" together. So each child imitated and performed the things they had seen and knew in their lives, acting like fathers, mothers, and aunties, performing very naturally and vividly with singing and speaking.
    Each child's little heart has an impression of Chairman Mao, New China, and the People's Liberation Army. In April, when the army went south, when they were still living in the front of Beihai Park, many children clamored for the aunties to take them to send off the People's Liberation Army. Once, the aunties took them to Beihai Park and saw many soldiers. The children naturally gathered around, warmly asking questions, asking how the People's Liberation Army fought the Kuomintang, how to fire cannons and guns. They also often performed acting as the People's Liberation Army and the Kuomintang in games. Every time the child who was pulled out to be the Kuomintang would often be beaten and cry. They all knew Chairman Mao, and they were very proud when they mentioned Chairman Mao. When the CPPCC was in session, the children from the nursery went to present flowers, and the children who did not go were very unhappy. The children who presented flowers came back and happily told the other children vividly what Chairman Mao looked like, how I presented flowers, how Chairman Mao was, and touched my head. Later, they even performed it collectively, who would be Chairman Mao, who would build a stage for Chairman Mao, present flowers, and present flags.
    In these various lives, they have unconsciously gained many valuable common knowledge, and deepened their love and familiarity with labor, the motherland, and the leader. In addition, the children also like music very much. When they hear drums or piano sounds, they will naturally move, twist the Yangko dance according to the rhythm, and walk into a circle or a straight line.

　　　　The Leaders and Childcare Workers of the Nursery
    This nursery is experimental in nature, exploring the experience of cultivating children based on China's current economic situation. The nursery implements collective leadership. In addition to the director, the nursery is divided into three sections for work: childcare, health care, and general affairs, with a total of twenty-four nursery workers, two teachers, one nutrition officer, and one nurse. Their work is carried out according to the principle of combining childcare and education. The nursery has a general assembly, a nursery affairs meeting, a section affairs meeting, an education seminar, a group meeting, and other meeting systems. All childcare workers have regular political and professional studies in addition to working hours. Political studies mainly involve reading some theoretical books and conducting collective discussions and research. Professional studies include children's nutrition, nursery education, children's care, child psychology, and children's diseases. In addition, there are two group meetings (class meetings) every week to set work plans and review work.
    Through learning, the childcare workers' understanding has been generally improved, and they are more serious and responsible for the children than in the past. They strictly implement the shift system and establish a work inspection system every day. All childcare workers also help children sew clothes and make toys in their spare time. They also take turns on duty at night, checked by cadres. Every nursery worker and teacher tries their best to experiment with how to better protect and educate the children, so that they become ideal children. The children's aunties love the children in the nursery as much as they love their own children, which can be seen in many aspects of taking care of the children's daily lives. One childcare worker told me that when she finds that a child is sick or unhappy, she will be sad and anxious and unable to sleep. When she sees the children jumping and playing happily, her own mood will be as active as the children.
    At present, the nursery's sanitary equipment is still relatively poor. In addition to a nurse who comes to check the children's health regularly every day, there is no fixed doctor stationed in the nursery. The nursery workers take the children's temperature once a day. In addition, in terms of children's nutrition, according to the nursery's current economic situation, there are two meals, two snacks, and one fruit a day, based on the principles of economy, hygiene, digestion, and interest, planned and allocated by the nursery's nutrition officer according to quantity.
    From the current situation, this is a good nursery. It is hoped that it can work hard to promote its work and continuously provide new experiences in the development of the nursery business in New China.

　　孩子们的乐园
    ——访北海实验托儿所
    柏生
    沿着河堤一直往北海后门方向走，快到尽处，看到一所红色庙宇似的房子，那便是蚕坛——北京市委举办的实验托儿所了。
    初冬的阳光，温暖的照着孩子们的脸，院子里红衣、蓝衣的成群孩子正欢欣的玩着、唱着、嚷着。
    两位保教人员——孩子们的阿姨，带我去看孩子们和参观孩子们的卧室、活动室、浴室。七十四个孩子的生活，是被分作四班管理的，两岁到两岁半是小班，两岁半到三岁半是中班（有两班），三岁半到五岁是大班。
    我们先去看小班。孩子们已经穿上了红花格子的布棉袄，一个个小红球似的，走还没有走稳，有的正在推小车，或者在搬积木，有的则围在阿姨跟前，抱着阿姨的腿在喊。这最小的一群，格外显得天真可爱。
    中班的孩子正在用树叶粘飞机，他们都穿着紫红色的工装小棉裤袄。有的正耐心地学着阿姨用树叶给他们粘好的飞机模型，有些孩子则很快的粘好了，等着阿姨领大家一同到院里去玩。
    院子里，大班的孩子们正做着户外活动，有的在玩翘翘板，有的在玩着滑梯，还有的正在荡着秋千。
    孩子们的几个卧室，都收拾得十分整洁，一排排的小床，都铺上了白色的小床单和红色蓝色的小毛毡。临近卧室的旁边，有的便是活动室，那里有小木桌、小木椅、积木、沙土箱，还有图画和小车……许多孩子们室内游戏的玩具。浴室里，洗脸的地方，每人都有一个固定的位置，放着他们的小脸盆和毛巾等物。因为孩子们还不能认识自己的名字，因此所有的孩子们的名字都是用画好的动植物做为代表的符号，每个孩子早晨都能按照符号找到自己洗脸的位置。浴池里几个孩子可以同时去洗澡。一切都布置得很整洁。
    　　　　孩子们的生活
    孩子们入所以后，每天七时起床，大班儿童自己会洗脸、铺床、升旗、分食物，中班是由阿姨帮忙的。早点后，八点钟孩子们在室内活动，大班、中班上课，学唱歌、做团体游戏，小班则由阿姨带着去屋里或户外玩积木、沙土、学扭秧歌、唱歌谣。但孩子们是好动的，他们爱好新的事物，喜欢模仿、好奇，欢喜在园内跑来跑去，他们常常接触园内的工人，看别人种菜拔草和挑水。孩子们亲热地喊着工人“叔叔！”并且就蹲在那里或跟随着工人仔细观看劳动操作。工友们也喜爱看这些孩子们，有一个工友给孩子们作了一支歌——“秋天到，天气好，叔叔种菜我拔草，阿姨说我好宝宝”。孩子们不时地唱在嘴里。有时阿姨也带他们到户外旅行游北海，或出城，看一些自然界的景物，使孩子们增广见闻。
    每当吃饭的时候，孩子们都是等大家坐好了才进餐，孩子们都养成了不挑食的习惯，大班孩子自己盛饭拿碗，中班也学着自己来做，小班的因为说话走路都还不利落，阿姨们随时帮助他们。有时孩子们偶然因争玩具打起来的时候，如果没有危险，阿姨总是让他们自己来解决。同样的，大班的孩子们是常常愿意在生活中去帮助小班和中班的孩子们解决一些困难的。每次所里打预防注射针时，大孩子们总是勇敢的站在最前面做榜样。
    孩子们在生活中，尤其是在集体玩的时候，常常喜欢做着自己生活经验中熟习的活动，把一些不连贯的事物贯穿在一起，编成故事，模仿的表演出来。孩子们在“搬家”或“过家家”“看娃娃”玩的时候，如果你仔细的观察时，就会发现那是多么美丽生动的一篇故事创造啊！一次，一个在广播电台工作的母亲的孩子和在文工团工作的爸爸的孩子，与几个在工厂工作的父母的孩子，他们在一起玩“过家家”“看娃娃”“搬家”。于是每个孩子都把他们在生活中曾经看到的、知道的事物模仿表演出来，学作父亲、母亲和阿姨们的神气，非常自然生动地有说有唱的表演起来。
    每个孩子的小心灵都有着一个毛主席、新中国、解放军的印象。四月里，当大军南下的时候，那时他们还住在北海前门的地方，许多孩子们争着要阿姨带他们去送解放军，一次阿姨带她们去北海，看到许多解放军，孩子们很自然地围拢起来，热烈地问长问短，问解放军怎样打国民党，怎样开炮放枪。他们在游戏时也常表演当解放军和国民党，每次被拉出做国民党的那个孩子，总是常常会被打哭了。他们都知道了毛主席，而且一说毛主席，都很神气。在政协开会的时候，托儿所的孩子们去献花，没去的孩子都很不愉快，献了花的孩子们回来高兴地向别的孩子们有声有色的讲着，毛主席是什么样，我献花，毛主席是怎样的，还摸了我的脑袋。以后他们并且集体表演起来，谁做毛主席，谁给毛主席搭台、献花、献旗。
    在这种种生活中，他们无形的多了许多宝贵的常识，加深了对劳动、对祖国、对领袖的热爱与熟悉。另外，孩子们对音乐也非常喜欢，当他们听到鼓声或琴声，会自然地动起来，按着节奏扭起秧歌，走成一个圈圈或一个直趟。
    　　　　所的领导与保教人员
    这个托儿所是实验性质的，根据目前中国现有的经济状况来摸索培养儿童的经验。所内实行集体领导，全所除所长外，分保教、保健、总务三股进行工作，共有二十四个保育员，两个教员，一个营养干事和一个护士。她们的工作是按照保教合一的原则，全所有全体大会、所务会、股务会、教育座谈会、小组会等会议制度。所有保教人员除工作时间外，都有定规的政治和业务学习。政治学习方面主要是读一些理论书籍，进行集体讨论和研究。业务学习方面如儿童营养、托儿所教育、儿童护理、儿童心理学、儿童疾病学等。此外每星期并开两次小组会（班会）定工作计划和检讨工作。
    保教人员经过学习，认识普遍提高，对孩子也比过去更加认真负责，她们每天严格执行接班制度并建立工作检查制度。所有保教人员在工作之余还帮助儿童缝衣和做玩具。夜里并轮流值班由干部检查。每一个保育员和教员都尽力的想法实验着怎样使自己能更好的保护和教育孩子们，使成为理想的儿童。孩子们的阿姨，她们爱托儿所里的儿童如同爱自己亲生的孩子一样，这在照护孩子们日常生活中的许多地方都可以看出来的。一个保育员告诉我，当她发现某一个孩子生病或是不愉快的时候，她会难过焦急得不能安睡，看到孩子们欢乐的跳着、玩着的时候，她自己的心情也会象孩子们一样的活跃起来。
    目前所内只有卫生设备还比较差，除了一个护士每天定时的来抽查孩子们的健康外，没有固定驻所的医生。每天由保育员给孩子们试一次体温表。此外孩子们的营养方面，按照目前所内现有的经济情况，每天两顿饭，两顿点心，一次水果，以经济、卫生、消化、兴趣为原则，由所内的营养干事按照数量来计划调配。
    从目前的情况看来，这是一个好的托儿所，希望能够努力推进业务，在新中国托儿事业的发展中，不断提供新的经验。
