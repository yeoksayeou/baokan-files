Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 12th: TASS Shanghai, November 11th dispatch: The trial of the so-called "Mitaka Incident" is continuing in Tokyo. After the procedure of verifying the identities of the defendants was completed, at the request of the defense lawyers, each defendant was given five minutes to speak. Except for Takeuchi, all defendants said that they were members of the Communist Party. They protested that forcing them to admit the charges against them was a violation of their rights. Defendant Iida said that during the trial, the prosecutor tried to force him to confess to crimes he had not committed through threats. Defendant Shimizu said that the investigation was unfair and biased. None of the defendants admitted to the charges against them. Defense lawyer Fuse said, "The trial was planned by the Yoshida government," and the defendants were arrested for political considerations. One attorney defending Suzuki emphasized that the railway authorities must be held responsible for the railway incident at Mitaka Station; and said that he was not allowed to investigate the destroyed train. Lawyer Hayashi (a member of the Japanese Communist Party) requested that the prosecution be dropped and the trial be stopped, because the accusation was based on threats and slander. Miyamoto Kenji, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, who served as a special defense lawyer, declared: "The Mitaka Incident" is a political conspiracy against the Communist Party. Other lawyers also requested the cancellation of the case. Nosaka Sanzo, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, attended the first hearing of the court. He told reporters that the Communist Party had nothing to do with the "Mitaka Incident." He condemned the Yoshida government's conspiracy to use the defendant Takeuchi to oppose the Communist Party. Nosaka pointed out that the prosecutor used the means of "controlling dangerous thoughts" of the former police to force Takeuchi to "confess." Japan is returning to the era of militarism. The next hearing will be on November 18th.

    妄图打击民主力量
    野坂揭露反动政府阴谋
    【新华社北京十二日电】塔斯社上海十一日讯：所谓“三鹰案”的审讯，正在东京继续进行。当验明被告身份的手续完成后，在辩护律师的要求下，被告每人被给予五分钟的发言机会。除竹内一人外，所有被告都说：他们是共产党员。他们抗议强迫他们承认加给他们的罪状是侵犯他们的权利。被告饭田说：在审讯时，起诉人力求以威胁手段，强迫他承认他不曾犯过的罪名。被告清水说：调查是不公平而有偏见的。没有一个被告承认加给他们的罪名。辩护律师布施说：“审讯是吉田政府策谋的”，被告是因为政治上的考虑而被捕的。为铃木辩护的一条强调：铁路当局必须负三鹰火车站铁路事件的责任；并说，他得不到允许去调查被毁的火车。律师林氏（日本共产党党员）要求取消起诉，停止审讯，因为这种控告是建立在威胁与诬告之上的。担任特别辩护律师的日本共产党中央委员会政治局委员宫本显治宣称：“三鹰案”是反对共产党的政治阴谋。其他律师也要求取消该案。日本共产党中央委员会政治局委员野坂参三，出席法庭的第一次开庭。他告记者说：共产党是与“三鹰案”毫无关系的。他斥责吉田政府利用被告竹内来反对共产党的阴谋。野坂指出：起诉人使用了从前警察“管制危险思想”的手段，强迫竹内“招认”。日本正在返回军国主义时代。下次开庭将在十一月十八日。
