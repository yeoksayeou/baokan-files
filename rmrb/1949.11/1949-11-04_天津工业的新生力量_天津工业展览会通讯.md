　　The New Force of Tianjin Industry
  　　Tianjin Industrial Exhibition Dispatch

    At the Tianjin Industrial Exhibition, the Industrial Improvement Hall left me with a strong impression. Just as the red sign hanging on the back door of the hall read, "Self-Reliance, Unceasing Self-Improvement," and the words "Oriented Towards the Rural Areas" were marked next to many exhibits, they vividly and truly summarized the entire content of the various exhibits in the hall.

    Upon entering the hall, a detailed diagram explaining the discovery of Zaoji grass for papermaking was hung directly opposite. The discovery of this grass is a great contribution to China's papermaking industry. Before liberation, Wang Yunshan, a technician at the Yangtze River Paper Mill, had already discovered that Zaoji grass could produce high-quality paper. However, under the rule of the Kuomintang bandits, he was burdened with daily struggles for survival, constantly complaining and rushing about. He had no interest, nor the possibility, to quietly experiment and research. After liberation, with the strong assistance of the People's Government, and after further testing by the state-owned Pulp Company, it has been confirmed that the resistance @ degree of grade A pulp can reach 176 times, and grade B can reach more than 130 times. Its texture is firm and smooth, making it an excellent raw material for papermaking. The diagram shows that this Zaoji grass is produced in Sui West, Sui East, North Chahar, Ningxia, Gansu, Xinjiang, and other provinces. The annual output of Wu Yuan and Linhe counties in Sui West alone is 1.5 million tons. Therefore, the raw materials for China's papermaking industry are inexhaustible. As long as these paper mills can be established on a large scale, China's paper needs will no longer need to be imported from foreign countries.

    On the south side of the Industrial Improvement Hall, several dark gray wooden boxes, as tall as a person, stood upright. These are Zhou Yunfeng-style electric incubators. The reporter saw a 2,000-egg type and an 8,000-egg type. This machine was developed through four years of experimentation and research, incorporating the best manufacturing methods of incubators from various countries around the world. The machine is simple to use, saves labor, and its hatching rate can reach 95%, comparable to the finest Japanese incubators. Therefore, in the past, we relied on foreign incubators, but now we can use domestic products. After liberation, Zhou Yunfeng also manufactured a fuel-powered incubator, whose effectiveness is no different from that of an electric one. According to test results, the success rate can reach 80%. In the future, it can be supplied to rural areas in large quantities.

    Behind the Industrial Improvement Hall, a rotating steam engine was installed and running, for the benefit of visitors from afar. This machine was invented by Huang Yufu, a worker at the Meilihua Factory. After fifteen years of research, and with the encouragement and assistance of the People's Government after liberation, he finally succeeded. The characteristic of the machine is that it uses the static pressure of steam to rotate the piston around the cylinder axis to generate power. Its advantages are that it is small in size and stable, easy to manage and use, and relatively easy to manufacture. It can also directly drive a generator. Coal and wood can be used as fuel. Its applications include large and small power plants, factories, large and small steamships, trains, mine hoists, water pumps, as well as the original power for irrigating fields and reclaiming cultivated land.

    The Industrial Improvement Hall also features the pit removing machine and medicinal herb cutting machine invented by Yang Mengchang, which are also new industrial products. The electric medicinal herb cutting machine can cut 7,000 catties per day, while manual cutting can only cut 30 catties per day. The pit removing machine can remove the pits of more than 1,000 catties of apricot and plum kernels per day, an efficiency that is 140 times higher than manual labor. However, the disadvantage is that the pit removing machine cannot separate the kernels, which is still being studied.

    Regarding agricultural improvement, the industrial circles of Tianjin, under the call of the People's Government to "develop industry and orient towards the rural areas," have made considerable achievements. For example, the Allen Chemical Plant developed the "666" insecticide after liberation, which is several times more effective than DDT and has a very low cost. Currently, due to the plant's incomplete equipment, its monthly output is only one ton. If it can be produced in large quantities in the future, preventing the import of American DDT will not be a problem. On the south side of the Improvement Hall, two grass bag weaving machines are laid flat, which are good tools for developing rural sideline occupations. They were invented by the North China Grass Products Co., Ltd. after liberation. Their manufacturing method is simple and easy to use, and can be widely adopted in rural areas.

    In terms of agricultural tool improvements, Chen Suren invented a new type of plough, which is light and easy to use, and one ox can do the work of two. Furthermore, the Fulong Iron Factory imitated and produced a manual corn thresher, which can thresh 1,200 catties of corn kernels per day. It also modified a rice husking machine, which can be used by both human and animal power, and each machine can husk 6,000 catties of brown rice per day.

    Due to the vigorous promotion and reward of inventions by the People's Government after liberation, workers, technicians, and scientific experts have unleashed their creative talents. According to a survey by the Foreign Trade Administration in July and August, Tianjin needs to import 371 kinds of industrial finished products and raw materials from foreign countries. According to incomplete statistics from a survey by the Bureau of Industry and Commerce of 182 factories in Tianjin (13 state-owned), a total of 149 kinds can be manufactured, including 53 kinds related to machinery such as blowers, lathes, steam engines, and manual bellows; 13 kinds related to chemistry such as sulfide blue, chrome yellow, bleaching powder, magnesium carbonate, and red prussiate of potash; 13 kinds of electrical materials; and 12 kinds of other cotton and woolen textiles. In addition, there are 64 kinds that can be restricted from import.

    In the nine months after liberation, the new industrial force in Tianjin has been developing vigorously. In the future, with the strong and planned encouragement and assistance of the People's Government, and further leveraging the intelligence and talents of workers, technicians, and experts, it will make even greater contributions to the industrial construction of the new China.

　　天津工业的新生力量
  　天津工业展览会通讯
    康伟中
    在天津工业展览会上，给我强烈印象的是工业改进馆。正如该馆后门悬挂的红牌子上写着的“自力更生，自强不息”和很多展览品的旁边标写的“面向农村”这些字迹一样，它们是这样生动和确实地概括了馆内各种展览品的全部内容。
    一进该馆大门，对面横挂着一幅枳机草发现可以造纸的说明详图。这种草的发现，在中国造纸业上是一伟大的供献。在解放前，长江造纸厂技士王蕴山就已发现枳机草能制出优良的纸张，但在国民党匪帮统治下，他每天为生活所苦恼、叫喊、奔走，他没有兴趣同时也不可能静心地试验和研究。解放后，他在人民政府的大力协助下，并由国营纸浆公司再次的化验，已证实甲种纸浆抵抗＠度能达一百七十六次，乙种能达一百三十多次，其质坚固而润滑，是优良的造纸原料。从图上看出这种枳机草出产于绥西、绥东、察北、宁夏、甘肃、新疆等省。仅绥西之五原、临河等县年产百五十万吨。因之，中国造纸业的原料是取之不尽，用之不竭的，只要这种纸厂能够大量建立起来，中国之所需纸张均不必外国进口了。
    在工业改进馆的南侧，竖立着几个深灰色的高及人头的木箱子，这就是周云峰式的电力孵卵机，记者看到的是两千卵型和八千卵型的。该机是经过四年的试验研究及采取世界各国保温箱、孵化器之精良制作方法综合而成。该机使用简便，节省人力，其孵化效果能达成百分之九十五，可与最精良的日本式孵化器抗衡，因之，过去均依赖外国的孵卵机，今后可以通用国货了。在解放后，周云峰又制造了火力孵卵机，其效力与电机无异，据试验结果，成数可达百分之八十。今后可大量供应农村使用。
    在工业改进馆的后面，按装着一个正开动着的旋转蒸汽机，这是为给远道来的观众参观的。该机是美利华厂工人黄玉符发明的，他经过了十五年的钻研，解放后，经人民政府的提倡与帮助，他最后研究成功了。该机之特点是利用蒸汽之静压力，使活塞绕气筒轴而旋转成为动力；其优点是体积小而稳固，易于掌管及使用，制造亦较容易，并可直接带动发电机。燃料用煤及木材均可。其用途可作大小发电厂、工厂、大小汽船、火车、矿山高车水泵，以及灌溉田地，开垦耕地之原动力。
    工业改进馆内还有杨孟长发明的打核机与切药机，也是工业上的新生东西，电力切药机每日能切七千斤，如人工切药每日仅能切三十斤；打核机每日能打杏仁、李仁一千余斤，效率超过人工一百四十倍。但缺点方面是打核机不能将子仁拣出来，这点尚在继续研究中。
    在对农业改进方面，津市的工业界在人民政府“发展工业，面向农村”的号召下，曾做了不少的成绩。如爱伦化学厂在解放后研究出“六六六”杀虫药剂，效能大过ＤＤＴ数倍以上，并且成本很低，目前由于该厂设备不完全，月产仅一吨，如今后能大量生产，杜绝美货ＤＤＴ入口当不成问题。在改进馆的南边，平放着两个草袋织机，这是发展农村副业的良好工具，是华北草制品股份有限公司在解放后发明的。其制法简单，使用方便，农村可以广泛的采用。
    在农具的改良上，如陈速仁发明新式耕地犁，使用轻便，用一头牛可做两头牛的活。还有福隆铁工厂仿造的人力搓玉米机，每天能搓玉米粒一千二百斤。并改制掳稻机，人力畜力均能使用，每台每日能掳糙米六千斤。
    由于解放后人民政府的大力提倡和奖励发明，工人、技师、科学专家发挥了他们的创造天才，根据对外贸易管理局七八月份调查，津市需要外国进口的工业成品及原料计三百七十一种；又根据工商局调查的津市一百八十二个工厂（国营十三个）不完全的统计，共有一百四十九种能够制造，其中包括有关机械方面的如鼓风机、车床、汽机、人力吹风箱等五十三种；化学方面的如硫化蓝、铬黄、漂白粉、碳酸美、赤血盐等十三种；电工器材有十三种；其他棉毛织品有十二种。另外可以限制入口的有六十四种。
    在解放后九个月中，天津市的工业新生力量是在蓬勃地发展着，今后在人民政府大力和有计划地奖励和帮助下，进一步发挥工人、技师及专家们的聪明才智，对新中国的工业建设，当有更大的供献。
