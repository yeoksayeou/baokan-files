    Distinguishing the Importance of Things
    Nai Dong
    The family letter "Talking About Human Touch," published in the People's Garden on November 3rd, can be said to represent the family letters of every revolutionary cadre; it also represents the love and sincerity of Communist Party members for the revolutionary cause and the people. This family letter can also give some people in the newly liberated areas who do not fully understand the revolution and family an answer.
    Some people in the newly liberated areas are unwilling to participate in revolutionary work and leave their families a little further away. They say: "I also know about the revolution and am willing to participate in revolutionary work, but I am unwilling to go to work in a faraway place; because who will take care of my family, parents, and wife? Their Communist Party cadres always say that our family concept is too deep, and this is a bit inhumane. Think about being born in this village and growing up in this family, who is willing to abandon it, who can't care and miss it! Don't their Communist Party cadres have families?! Don't they miss their parents and wives when they are outside?!"
    This clearly shows a lack of understanding of the revolution and insufficient self-awareness. It must be understood that Communist Party cadres also have families, parents, and wives. Their participation in the army and revolutionary work in faraway places does not mean that they have abandoned their families, parents, and wives! Forgotten! Don't miss them at all?! The main key is that they clearly recognize and distinguish the importance and size of things. Heng's family letter answers it quite clearly.
    They are not inhumane and have not forgotten their families. They see that millions of people are still suffering under the rule of the reactionaries. They want to liberate the broad masses of the people and overthrow imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. For this important task, they bravely leave their families, leave their parents and wives, and go to the front lines of the revolution.
    The revolution is for the broad masses of the people to live a peaceful and happy life, which requires first completely eliminating the Kuomintang reactionaries. Can the Kuomintang reactionaries be completely eliminated by sitting at the door of your home? This is absolutely impossible. You must defeat them, chase them wherever they flee, and fight them wherever they go. Only then can the new China be built, and the people can live a stable life and obtain eternal happiness!
    If you only say you are willing to participate in revolutionary work but are actually reluctant to leave your home, that is a selfish act of inverting the importance of things.

    分清事情的轻重
    耐冬
    十一月三日，人民园地刊登的“谈近人情”，这一封家信，可以说代表了每一个革命干部人员的家信；也代表了共产党员对于革命事业和对人民的热爱与真诚；这一封家信，更可以给新解放区一些对革命与家庭还不甚了解的人一个答复。
    新解放区有些人，对于参加革命工作，离开家庭走远一点，便不愿意，他们说：“我也知道革命，也愿意参加革命工作，只是去到远的地方工作，我不愿意；因为家庭，父母妻子谁来照管呀？他们共产党干部，总是说我们家庭观念太深，这话说的有些不近人情，你想生在这个乡，长在这个家，谁舍得抛弃，谁能不关心，不恋念呀！难道他们共产党干部就没有家吗？！在外边就不想念父母、妻子吗？！”
    这分明是对于革命认识不清，自己的觉悟还不够。要知道，共产党干部人员，也都有家、有父母、妻子，他们参军，到远方来搞革命工作，并不是把家庭、父母、妻子都抛掉了！忘了！一点也不知想念？！主要的关键就在于他们把事情的轻重、大小认的清，分的明。恒的这封家信就回答的挺清楚。
    他们不是不近人情，忘掉了家，他们是看见了千百万人民还在反动派统治下受着苦难，他们要去解放广大的人民，要打倒帝国主义，封建主义，官僚资本主义，为了这个重大的任务，所以，才勇敢地离开家庭，离开父母，妻子，走向了革命的前线。
    革命是为了广大人民过安乐幸福的日子，这就必须先彻底消灭国民党反动派。要彻底消灭国民党反动派，坐在家门口就能消灭吗？这是绝对不成的，必须去打倒他们，他们逃到那儿，追到那儿，打到那儿。才能把新中国建设起来，人民才能过安定的日子，得到永远的幸福！
    如果只是嘴里说愿意参加革命工作，而实际上却舍不得离开家，那是轻重倒置的自私行为。
