From Fushun Mining Bureau's Factories and Mines

　　【Our Dispatch】The New Record Creation Movement at the Fushun Mining Bureau rapidly expanded to encompass all areas in late October. Currently, all twenty-three factories and mines (including forty-five independent production units) under the bureau have new records. According to preliminary statistics on November 2nd, over a thousand people have created new records in more than five hundred different types of work, including steelmaking, coal mining, oil production, transportation, mechanical and electrical work, and civil engineering, and have been rewarded. Now, all old standards and old quotas in the factories and mines under the Mining Bureau have been broken, pushing the entire work forward to a new stage. After Kong Xiangrui's team at the Victory Mine of the Mining Bureau created a record of 6.8 tons of coal mined per person in eight hours on October 13th, they increased it to 8.55 tons on the 20th. However, Li Jinshun's team mined 10 tons, and Zheng Wenyu's team created a record of 15 tons. This figure exceeded the past quota by a full 200%. Under their influence, the mine's daily output rapidly increased from 1,080 tons to 3,030 tons, with an average daily output of over 7 tons per person. In the steelmaking plant, the time required for one furnace of steel was reduced from 4 hours and 45 minutes to 1 hour and 53 minutes. At the Mechanical and Electrical Plant, under the influence of worker Zhang Fengde, 94 people created new records. There are two key factors for the rapid and comprehensive development of this movement: one is that the leadership has always stood at the forefront of the movement; the other is timely rewards and timely summarization of experience to promote the rapid development of the movement.

　　抚顺矿务局所属各厂矿
    突破旧生产定额
  　千余职工创新纪录得到奖励
    【本报讯】抚顺矿务局创造新纪录运动，已于十月下旬迅速扩展至全面。现该局所属二十三个厂矿（包括四十五个独立生产单位）已无一处无新纪录。据本月二日的初步统计，已有千余人在炼钢、采煤、制油、运输、机电、土木……等五百余件不同的工种中，创造了新纪录，受到奖励。现矿务局所属各厂矿一切旧的标准，旧的定额，均被打破，把整个工作，推向一个新的阶段。矿务局所属胜利矿的孔祥瑞小组十月十三日创造了每人八小时挖煤六·八吨之纪录后，于廿日又增为八·五五吨，可是李金顺组却挖至十吨，郑文有组则创造了十五吨的纪录。这个数字整整超过了过去定额的百分之二百。在他们的影响下，全矿由日产一千零八十吨，迅速增至日产三千零卅吨。总平均每人日产七吨多。炼钢厂过去一炉钢须时四点四十五分，现在降至一点五十三分。机电厂在张凤德工友的影响下，即有九十四个人创造了新纪录。这一运动之所以如此猛烈而迅速的全面展开，有两个关键：一个是领导上始终站在运动的前面；一个是及时奖励及时总结经验，推动运动的迅速发展。
