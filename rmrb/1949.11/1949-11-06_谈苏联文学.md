　　Talking About Soviet Literature
    By Boluoke, Translated by Chen Zhanyuan

    This is the speech draft of the famous French writer Jean Richard Bloch delivered at the France-Soviet Association in Paris on June 15, 1945. It details the status of writers in Soviet society, the conditions for publishing or performing works, and the close relationship between writers and the people. When discussing Soviet literature, Bloch contrasts it with the decadent literature of the Western European bourgeoisie, highlighting the former's infinitely bright future and the latter's impending collapse, just like the class to which it belongs. The original is long, and the following is an excerpt.

    If we turn our eyes from the Western literary world to the Soviet literary world, we find a land at the opposite extreme of our own.

    In the Soviet Union, there are no longer two superimposed peoples, hostile to each other, each with its own knowledge, its own education, and its own distinct culture. The trenches of Latin, the barbed wire of classical humanism, are spread out like anti-tank ditches between these knowledge, education, and culture. In the Soviet Union, there is only one people, receiving the same knowledge, nourished by the same philosophy, because they enjoy the same rights, because they bear the same obligations, because no individual has the privilege of placing his superiority, his leisure, his luxury, his culture on the enslavement of workers.

    How will such a situation affect the conditions of writers? Let us illustrate with a few figures.

    The state is the largest publisher, far exceeding all others. A new, ordinary novel written in Russian has a minimum print run, a trial print run, that usually does not fall below 100,000 copies. And what I am saying here, let me state, is written only for readers who read Russian, in other words, Russian works written only for a portion of the 180 million Soviet people.

    In the Soviet Union, the desire to read is so great that this print run is usually sold out within a few hours. A book published in the morning is impossible to buy in the evening. Then, based on reports from the directors of 86,000 public libraries nationwide, and the librarians of countless public undertakings and organizations, if necessary, the book is reprinted. This edition can reach 300,000 to 400,000 copies, and usually only a few weeks separate it from the first edition.

    At this point, the authorities of the State Publishing Bureau assess the success or failure of the book. If the book is a success, a print run approaching or exceeding one million copies is not uncommon. This edition is quickly realized. Therefore, Soviet writers know exactly for whom they are writing. They know who their readers are. In the Soviet Union, the connection between readers and writers is also beyond our imagination. I believe that nowhere in the world do writers receive such love, such respect, and such touching expressions of gratitude as in the Soviet Union.

    In the Soviet Union, the massive amount of correspondence received by writers is one measure of their success, but it also constitutes a barrier and a check on this success. Because even the most distant, most humble reader knows that culture is his share, just as the country is his share, and facing this culture that he greatly admires, he does not hold the shy posture of a peasant with muddy boots entering a rich man's parlor. He inquires, he argues, he corrects, he criticizes. The more he loves to read the book, the more he nitpicks the errors he finds in the reports or reviews there.

    In factories, in collective farms, in various organizations, whenever a new book is published, a symposium is convened. In this symposium, after a report is given by several members or by the secretary of the local literary association, everyone discusses the book. The summary of the discussion – whether it is a criticism or a favorable comment on the book – is sent to the author. During the war, the same method was applied to all military units. These units expressed their evaluations of the works about the war written by the most well-known writers or the most famous newspaper correspondents with equal enthusiasm.

    Not only that.

    One of the common practices there is that authors are invited to factories, troops, government offices, and the literary associations of organizations to read several chapters of their works before they are published, or to discuss the works with members of the literary association after the works are published. I have attended many of these symposiums. They are very interesting. They have given me a strong impression. Seriousness, enthusiasm, youth, joy, trust, and friendship are the greatest features of these symposiums, and there is also the most perfect honesty, a frankness whose audacity is only bearable because it carries the deepest friendship. And this friendship, as I have told you, always unites the reader and the author.

    Another very striking thing is that ordinary workers and peasants are very good at expressing their thoughts. This ability comes from the regular habit of public gatherings in the Soviet Republic since the October Revolution.

    A strict test for vanity! I know many French writers who would be at a loss to cope with these debates. One has to abandon the author's self-esteem! One has to be a person prepared to meet others head-on, eye-to-eye, and hear others say their shortcomings. I have heard the chairwoman of a collective farm, a powerful and formidable woman, railroad workers, and sailors of the Black Sea point out the big and small shortcomings of famous writers. The noise of the Stalin Prize cannot intimidate them. And when I see an Ehrenburg, a Sholokhov, an Alexei Tolstoy, a Leonid Leonov, a Tikhonov, a Fadeyev, a Boris Gorbatov, and a Simonov all go to participate in these discussions so cheerfully, I understand that something great, new, and profound is being produced in Soviet literature.

    Shall we talk about drama? Any playwright can, like in France, directly contact a theater manager to stage his work, and obtain the manager's permission to stage the work. But this method is not the only method. Above the Russian theaters, only in Russia, in the Russian Republic, there is a General Association of Theaters, and above all the theaters in the Soviet Union – heaven knows how many theaters there are! – there is a State Drama Committee.

    I am very familiar with this State Drama Committee. It is run by some young and capable people. This committee, just like a theater manager, has the right to reserve and accept scripts, and has the right to sign contracts for these reservations or acceptances. These contracts themselves are already very favorable to the author. Once the committee obtains the right to stage a script, once the original manuscript is in hand, it introduces the script to all theaters in Moscow, Leningrad, the provinces, and other republics that it believes would be interested in the script, or that are capable of rehearsing the script well. Therefore, without you having to find connections, ask for favors, or make lengthy and tedious requests until you are exhausted, your script may be performed on the stages of many cities.

    Recently, a telegram notified me (which I did not expect at all) that a new script I recently wrote, "Toulon," is being performed in Chita, a city deep in Siberia, and at the same time, it is being rehearsed in Moscow. And the author, as in France, has the performance royalties collected by the Writers' Association.

    Furthermore, there is a regulation that stipulates that no matter how a theater accepts a script, either directly or through the State Drama Committee, that theater can only retain the exclusive right to stage the play locally for a certain period of time, usually six months.

    Six months after the play is first staged, any other theater in the same city has the right to continue staging the play. Therefore, we can see a successful play being performed on three stages in Moscow at the same time, with three directing methods and three different techniques. As such, the play will naturally cause a sensation throughout the city, making residents rush to see it, maintaining the audience's love for drama, and making the members of the art troupe know how to cherish themselves and be faithful to their art.

    I have not yet mentioned the troupes performing in the army. For example, a certain play by Simonov was performed on thirty stages at the same time, many of which were on the front lines, and all were performed just as carefully, if not everywhere as exquisitely.

    Another point that must be pointed out is that after a script is accepted by a theater manager, it must then be read to all the actors, and all the actors discuss it. If they do not like the script, they have the right to reject the script by a majority vote. I have participated in such discussions, and I myself have been the protagonist of such discussions twice. I am willing to testify that if there, as in all gatherings, there are also some people of varying degrees, everything there is serious, careful, and just. A script accepted by all the actors gains extra credit among the actors because of this event. In this regard, how many French playwrights who are fond of being petty and easily angered can appear amicably before such a court?

    I have seen a person, unfortunately, this person died just too early, he is Alexei Tolstoy. When I left Moscow, he was still alive. At the end of last year, Alexei Tolstoy truly achieved the greatest honor that a person can currently obtain; it can be said that he became a poet laureate to some extent. Well, I saw the Soviet poet laureate, a guest of the Kremlin, a friend of Stalin, and the best-selling author, calmly watching one of his scripts being rejected by the actors of the Small Theater, and what kind of script was it! A script about the tyrant Ivan, this script is the pinnacle of Russia's, especially Russia's current historical traditions. Although his script was accepted by the State Drama Committee and the heads of the Small Theater, he had to rewrite his script five or six times until the actors accepted it. Then, at the time it was staged, although it was approved by several senior comrades, it was subjected to such fierce criticism in the newspapers that Tolstoy had to remove it from the repertoire.

    Therefore, you see, in the Soviet Union, whether through writings or through theaters, the writer's contact with readers or audiences is close, frequent, and mutual. The writer knows what kind of readers his readers are. Regarding the question "Who are you writing for?" over there, he knows what to say to answer.

    In Western Europe, for the reasons I have told you, intellectual eccentricity affirms a certain personal position that is irrelevant to the country's vital interests. Personality there only becomes prominent when it is opposed to the masses.

    Here, the cultivation of personality as a battlefield of quirks, eccentricity, and worries. There, a society dedicated to constantly reducing the scope of worries, whether material or spiritual. Here, an elegant, refined society, whose current form is dying out, perishing in noble pleasures. There, a young society, young not only from a demographic point of view, but also young due to the hope aroused in the heart by a completely open philosophy, Marxism, which seems to be projected towards the future, towards the conquest of the future.

    When Western Europeans come into contact with Soviet literature, they are completely at a loss due to the fact that Soviet literature is a literature that attracts the attention, love, and trust of millions of readers.

    For example, one of the things that Western Europeans find surprising is the position that war has occupied in Soviet literature in the past three years. It's very simple. It is because the position that war occupies in literature is the same as the position it occupies in the lives of the people.

    Conversely, when a Soviet person leaves the Soviet Union and comes to France, his surprise is to see sentences like the following in the magazines he buys: "Like the lament for lost freedom, or the clichés of the suffering of the motherland, they are bound to quickly lose their effectiveness in poetry..."

    His surprise is to see a literature where, with a few exceptions, with a few kick-off resistance movement poems, war can be said to have no place at all.

    When Western Europeans come into contact with current Soviet literature, they easily feel that this literature is too simple, too concrete, too simple, too unadorned. When these critics see a film like "Wait for Me" or a play like "Invasion," they will be shocked. In this film or this play, there are no strange tricks, no extremely cunning psychological changes, there is not even, like in Charles Morgan's plays, a reassuring atmosphere of a ball, whiskey, and female hysteria. Everything there is serious, simple, direct, profound, humane, and concrete.

    I want to especially mention these two characteristics: humane and concrete.

    It is exactly the opposite of what the fashionable literature of France and its neighboring countries has shown us for the past twenty-five or fifty years, where everything is cunning and abstract. Very brilliant, yes. The French literary world has never been so crowded with talents as in the past twenty-five years. It is indeed like Alexandria at dusk of Greek civilization.

    Which names do we especially remember among the large contingent of Soviet wartime writers?

    First of all, I would like to talk to you about a new writer: Gorbatov. Gorbatov has published a kick-off novel that is almost unparalleled in the war literature of recent years. The name of this novel is "The Unconquered People." Gorbatov is a miner from Ukraine, thirty-five years old, who started writing ten years ago. This is a broad-shouldered, sturdy, burly, calm, and friendly person, a very approachable and sympathetic person. What is his novel? What is "The Unconquered People"? This is a very bold book, in his own way, like Leonid Leonov's "Invasion," but with the addition of the various developments allowed by the novel. He tells us about what happened in a small mining village in Ukraine, where the family of the old miner Taras lives. He describes the changes in this family, with some family members going towards heroic action, and some family members, on the contrary, going towards surrender to the victors and towards moral bankruptcy. And in between the two, there are those neutrals, those who are easy to deal with. The endless tragedies of this story, almost without incident, arise from the contact of these three types of people, solely from the contact of these three types of people. The novel is written with a very skillful style, the story unfolds very leisurely, and the author's heart is exceptionally calm. This is a sign of great talent.

    We also meet our old friend Sholokhov, the author of "And Quiet Flows the Don" and "Virgin Soil Upturned," who is writing a book that is being published in installments in "Izvestia": "They Fought for Their Country."

    We see a new writer, Vasily Grossman, who has written a remarkable book, "The Undying People," and a very good reportage, "Stalingrad," which has the value and significance of a literary work, and it can be preserved for posterity.

    Konstantin Simonov is a very remarkable person. This is a very talented person, young, and he always succeeds in whatever he does. At the beginning of the Second European War, he published a poem in "Izvestia" consisting of six stanzas, each with six lines of varying lengths, called "Wait for Me." Konstantin Simonov only found on this day the greatest theme of human sensibility and tailored it. People who have seen the film adapted from this song know what I am talking about.

    What does the soldier say in this song? Wait for me...

    "Wait for me, and I'll return all the same.
    Only wait a long, long time.
    Wait for me, and I'll return, though all those who wait no more complain
    That you forget their rhyme.

    Let son and mother think that I no longer am,
    Let friends await in vain,
    Let them sit round the fire and drink a bitter dram,
    Waiting will bring them pain.

    Wait! And I'll return, eschewing evil fate.
    Let those who didn't wait say, 'Lucky's his.'"
    Those who didn't wait will never know, it is too late,
    How you saved me by your wait.

    Only you knew how to wait, no one else knew how.
    How you saved me by your wait.
    Those who didn't wait will never know, it is too late,
    How you saved me by your wait.

    Deadly fire hit my head, I somehow survived.
    Only you knew how to wait, no one else knew how.
    And how I survived, we will know it by and by:
    Simply - I knew how to wait.

    Well, this poem spread quickly in the army, and more and more people loved to sing it. When I left the Soviet Union, fifty-two composers had already set it to music. It was sung everywhere, and it even became a repeated chorus. On the radio, you only heard this song sung in various tones! Simonov rewrote it into a movie, and he adapted it into a play, and both achieved the same success.

    He also wrote a book, and I will not hesitate to recommend this book to you. Its name is "Days and Nights"... What is this book about?

    This is the story of a squad leader and his squad who are ordered to guard three houses in Stalingrad. This is the story of them guarding these three houses during the last few weeks of the Battle of Stalingrad, when the German troops were advancing step by step. Without rhetoric, without exaggeration, without fantasy, the story is told with the simplicity of everyday life.

　　谈苏联文学
    勃洛克作  陈占元译
    这是法国名作家若望·里夏·勃洛克在一九四五年六月十五日在巴黎法苏协会演说的讲演稿。其中详细说明了作家在苏联社会中的地位，作品的印行，或演出的条件，作家和人民之间的密切关系。勃洛克在论苏联文学时一边又把西欧资产阶级的没落的文学来做对比，更显出前者具有无限光辉的前途，后者和它所属的阶级一样，正面临崩溃的末路。原文较长，节译如下。
    假如我们从西方文学界转过眼去看苏联文学界，我们便发见一片与我们的国土处在对极的国土。
    在苏联，再没有两种叠架起来的人民，彼此敌对，各有一种知识，各有一种教育，各有一种不同的文化，拉丁文的战壕，古典人文主义的铁丝网，就象一道防坦克车的壕堑一样，展开在这些知识、教育与文化之间。在苏联，只剩有一种人民，受到相同的知识，寝馈着相同的哲学，因为他们享受相同的权利，因为他们担负相同的义务，因为任何个人，都没有把他的优越，他的闲暇，他的豪侈，他的文化，安置在工作者的奴役之上的特权。
    这样的事态将怎样影响到作家的条件呢？让我们用几个数字来说明一下。
    国家是远超过别的出版家最大的出版家。一本新的用俄文写的最平常的小说有一种起码的印数，一种试销的印数，通常不会少于十万册，而我在这里说的，让我申明一下，是只为念俄文的读者，换言之，是只为一万八千万苏维埃人中的一部分人而写的俄文著作。
    在苏联，阅读欲是如是之大，这个印数通常在几个钟头之内就卖完了。一本早上出版的书，晚上想买它是白费力。于是便根据国内八万六千个公共图书馆的馆长，和无数公共事业和社团的图书馆馆长的报告，如果需要的话，又把这本书再版一次，这一版可能达到三四十万册，而且通常和第一版相隔只有几个星期。
    这时国家出版局的当局才估量到那本书的成功或失败。假如那本书是成功的话，接近或超过一百万册的印数不是希罕的事。这一版很快就得到实现。因此苏联作家确切知道他是写给什么人看。他知道他的读者是什么人。在苏联，读者与作家的联系的情形也是非我们所能想象的。我相信世上任何地方，都没有象苏联那样，作家得到这样的爱戴，这样的敬重，以及受到这样动人的感激的表示。
    在苏联，作家收到的巨量通信是他们成功的尺度之一，但它也构成这种成功的障壁和检查，因为那怕是非常远路、非常卑微的读者，知道文化有他的份儿，一如国家也有他的份儿，面对着这种他虽然非常赞赏的文化，却并不持着闯进阔人客厅里的足踏木履的农民的羞怯姿态。他询问，他争辩，他修正，他责难。他愈爱读那本书，对于他在那里找到的报道或评鉴的错误他便愈加吹毛求疵。
    在工厂里面，在集体农场里面，在各种社团里面，每逢一本新书出版，都召集一个座谈会，在这个座谈会里面，由几个会员或由当地文艺会的秘书作一报告之后，大家便讨论这本书，讨论的总结——无论是对这本书的一种指摘或是一种好评——就给寄到作者。在战时，同样的办法给应用到所有军队单位里面。这些单位对于最知名的作家或最著名的报纸通信员所写的关于战事的著作都一样热烈地说出他们的评价。
    不单这样。
    在那边经常的办法之一，就是作者被邀到工厂、部队、机关、社团的文艺会里面，在他的著作未出版之前，前来朗诵若干章他的著作，或在该作品出版之后，前来与文艺会会员一道对这本作品加以讨论。我参加过许多这些座谈会。这是非常有趣的。它们给过我很强的印象。认真、热心、青春、愉快、信任、友情，就是这些座谈会里面最大的特色，而且还有最完美的诚实，一种它的冒昧，因为其中带有最深刻的友爱才使人受得起的坦白，而这种友爱，我对诸位说过了，却始终把读者和作者联合起来。
    还有一件十分触目的事，就是普通工人和农民都非常善于表达自己的思想，这种能力是由十月革命以来苏维埃共和国的公共集会的经常习惯得来的。
    对于虚荣的严格试练！我认识许多法国作家，他们对这些辩难一定会穷于应付的。得把作者的自尊心抛弃！得作一个准备好和别人碰头的人，眼睛对着眼睛，听别人说出自己的缺点。我听过集体农场的女主席，有力和历害的妇人，铁道职员，黑海的海员，对知名作家说出他们大大小小的缺点，斯大林奖金的喧吓可吓不倒他们。而当我看到一个爱伦堡，一个萧洛霍夫，一个阿力克斯·托尔斯泰，一个里昂尼·里奥诺夫，一个吉洪诺夫，一个法捷耶夫，一个波里斯·哥尔巴托夫，一个西蒙诺夫，都这么兴高采烈地走去参加这些讨论会时，我明白了有种伟大，崭新、深刻的东西正在苏联文学里面产生了。
    我们要讲讲戏剧么？凡戏剧作家都可以，象在法国一样，和一家戏院经理直接接洽上演他的作品，并且获得该经理允许上演他的作品。但这种办法不是唯一的办法。在诸俄国戏院之上，单独在俄国，在俄罗斯共和国，有一个戏院总会，而在苏联所有的戏院——天知道有多少戏院！——的全体之上，有一个国家戏剧委员会。
    我很熟知这个国家戏剧委员会，它是由一些年青干练的人主持的。这个委员会完全和一个戏院经理一样，有权预约及接受剧本，有权签订这些预约或接受的契约，这些契约本身对作者已经是非常有利的。这个委员会一经获得一个剧本的上演权，剧本的原稿一经拿到手里，它就把这个剧本介绍给莫斯科，列宁格勒，外省，以及其他各共和国所有它认为会对这个剧本感到兴趣的，或对于排演这个剧本能够胜任愉快的戏院，因此用不着你找关系，托人事，作冗长无味的请求，弄到你精疲力竭，你的剧本就可能在许多城市的舞台上演出。
    最近有一个电报通知我（这是我完全意料不到的），说我新近写好的一个剧本：“土伦”，正在深入西伯利亚的赤塔城演出，同时它正在莫斯科排演。而作者也如在法国一样由作家协会代收上演税。
    还有。那边有一个章则，规定不管一间戏院以怎样方式接受一个剧本，或者直接地，或者通过国家戏剧委员会，那间戏院只能在一定的时间，通常是六个月，保留在当地单独上演该剧的权利。
    该剧第一次上演后六个月，同一城市任何别的戏院都有权利继续演出这个戏，因此我们可以看到某个成功的剧本同时在莫斯科三个舞台，用三种导演手法，三种不同的技巧演出，如是这个剧本自然会哄动全城，使全城居民争先恐后去看它，使观众对于戏剧的爱好维持不坠，使艺术剧团的团员知道自爱，和知道忠实于他的艺术。
    我在这里还没有提到在军队里面演出的剧团。举例说，西蒙诺夫某出戏同时在三十个舞台上演，其中有好些舞台是在前线，而且都一样仔细演出，假如不是到处演得一样精湛的话。
    还有一点必须指出的，就是当一个剧本被戏院经理接受以后，跟着得把它向全体演员读过，全体演员把它讨论，假如他们不喜欢这个剧本，他们有权以多数票数拒绝接受这个剧本。我参加过这种讨论会，我自己也当过两次这类讨论会的主角，我愿意证明假如在那里，也如在一切集会里面一样，也遇到一些程度参差的人，那里一切的经过可都是认真、仔细、和正当的。一个为全体演员接受的剧本就以这件事实在演员中间获得额外的信用。即就这一点说，有多少法国爱使小性子容易动怒的剧作者能够和颜悦色在这样一个法庭之前出庭作答呢？
    我看见过一个人，很可惜这个人刚刚过早死了，他就是阿力克斯·托尔斯泰，我离开莫斯科的时候他还健在。去年年底，阿力克斯·托尔斯泰实实在在地达到了一个人在目前所能获得的最大荣誉；可以说在某种程度成为桂冠诗人。好的，我看见苏联的桂冠诗人，克林姆宫的客人，斯大林的朋友，最行销的作者，竟安然看着他的一个剧本被小剧院的剧员拒绝了，而且是怎样的一个剧本啊！一个写暴君伊凡的剧本，这个剧本是俄国的，特别是目前俄国的历史传统的登峰造极之作。他的剧本虽然得到国家戏剧委员会和小剧院的主持人的接受，他可得把他的剧本重写五六次，直到剧员接受它为止，然后在它上演的当儿，虽然得到几个高级同志的同意，它在报章上面却遭受到这么猛烈的抨击，托尔斯泰只好把它从戏码上面抽掉。
    因此，诸位看到，在苏联，作家不管是通过著作，或通过戏院，他与读者或观众的按触是密切的、经常的、相互的。作家知道他的读者是怎样的读者，对于那个“您写给谁看？”的问题，在那边，他晓得用什么话回答。
    在西欧，为了对诸位说过的理由，智力上的炫奇立异肯定着某种与国家痛痒无关的个人的位置。人格在那里只有在与大众对立时才得显著。
    这边，作为怪癖、乖张、忧烦的战场的人格的培养。那边，一个致力于把不管是物质的抑是心灵的忧烦的范围不断缩小的社会。这边，一个雅致的、精细的社会，它目前的形式消磨殆尽了，在高贵的逸乐里面灭亡。那边，一个年青的社会，不单就人口统计的观点说是年青的，可是由于一种完全开放的，并且仿佛向着未来，向着对未来的征服投射出去的哲学，马克思主义，在心灵里面引起的希望而年青的社会。
    当西欧人和苏联文学接触的时候，由于这一事实至于完全无所适从，苏联文学是一种获得千千万万读者注意、爱戴和信任的文学。
    举例说，西欧人引为惊讶的事情之一，就是战争在最近三年来苏联文学里面所占的位置。简单得很。为的是战争在文学里面所占的位置与它在人民生活里面所占的位置是一样的。
    相反，当苏联人离开苏联，来到法国的时候，他的惊讶就是在他买来的杂志里面见到象下面的句子：“象对于失去的自由的惋惜，或祖国的苦痛的陈套滥调，在诗歌里面势必很快失去效力的……”
    他的惊讶就是看见一种文学，除却若干例外，除却若干可击节的反抗运动的诗之外，战争在那里可以说是没有一点儿位置的。
    当西欧人接触到目前苏联文学的时候，他易于觉得这种文学过于朴素，过于具体，过于单纯，太没有花样。这些批评家看到象“等待着我”的一个影片，或者看到象“侵略”的一个剧本，他们会瞿然而起，在这个影片或这篇剧本里面，没有希奇的把戏，异常狡诈的心理变化，那里甚至也没有，象在差尔斯·摩根（Ｃｈａｒｌｅｓ　Ｍｏｒｇａｎ）的剧本里面一样，一种舞会，威士忌酒，女性的歇斯特里的使人安心的氛围，在那里一切都是严肃的、单纯的、直接的、深刻的、人性的和具体的。
    我要特别提到这两个特点：人性的和具体的。
    和二十五年来或五十年来法国及其邻邦的时行文学写给我们看的东西恰巧相反，在那里一切都是狡诈和抽象。十分出色的，不错。法国文学界从没有象最近二十五年来这样侪侪多士的。的的确确象希腊文明日暮＠磁的时候的阿力山特里。
    在苏联战时作家庞大的队伍中间我们尤其记得的有那几个名字呢？
    首先，我想对诸位讲到一个新作家：哥尔巴托夫。哥尔巴托夫发表过一本可击节的小说，在最近数年战争文学里面几乎没有其匹，这本小说的名字是“不可征服的人们”。哥尔巴托夫是乌克兰的一个矿工，三十五岁，十年前开始写作。这是一个宽膊、结实、魁梧、沉静、友爱的人，一个非常近人情和值得同情的人。他的小说是什么呢？“不可征服的人们”是什么呢？这是一本非常大胆的书，依照他的方式，象里昂尼·里奥诺夫的“侵略”，但是还添上小说所允许的种种发展。他给我们讲乌克兰一个小小的采矿的村落里面发生的事情，老矿工特拉斯的家庭住在这个村落里面，他描写这个家庭的变化，有些家人走向英勇行动，有些家人却相反，走向对胜利者的屈服，和走向道德的破产，而介乎二者之间的，就是那些中立者，那些易于对付的人。这个故事层出不穷的惨剧，差不多没有事故，是从这三种人物的接触，单单从这三种人物的接触产生出来的。用一种非常纯熟的笔法写成的小说，故事非常从容地展开，作者的心灵异常宁静，这是具有伟大才能的标记。
    我们再遇到我们的老友萧洛霍夫，“静静的顿河”和“未开恳的处女地”的作者，他正在写着一本书，在“消息报”上分段发表：“为祖国而战”。
    我们见到一个新作家，瓦西里·格鲁斯曼，他写过一本了不起的书“不死的人民”，和一本很好的报道“斯大林格勒”的报告文字，这本书具有一种文学作品的价值和意义，它是可以留存后世的。
    康斯但丁·西蒙诺夫是一个非常了不起的人。这是一个天分很高的人，年轻，他做什么事总是顺利的，他在第二次欧战开始时在“消息报”发表了一首六节，每节六句的长短句的诗，名字叫“等待着我”，康斯但丁·西蒙诺夫不过在这天找到了一个人类感受性的最伟大的题材，把它施以剪裁。看过用这只歌改编的影片的人知道我在说什么了。
    那士兵在这只歌里面说什么话呢？等我……
    “等待着我吧，因为在等我的当儿你将把我拯救。
    等待着我吧，因为在对我忠诚的当儿你将使我活。
    众人将相信我死了，众人将把我掩埋
    众人将用未完成过去时讲我。
    如果单只你在世上始终深信我活着，
    我将活着，我将回来……等待着我吧！……”
    好的，这首诗在军队里面不胫而走，爱唱他的人一天比一天多，当我离开苏联的时候，已经有五十二个作曲家把它谱成音乐。到处都唱它，它甚至成为一种反复歌唱的尾声。在收音机里面只听到用种种调子唱出来的这支歌儿！西蒙诺夫把它改写了一出电影，他把它改编成一个剧本，都得到同样的成功。
    他又写了一本书，我不会吝惜我的口舌向诸位推荐这本书的，它的名字是“日日夜夜”……在这本书里面讲的又是什么呢？
    这是受命守卫斯大林格勒三所房子的一个小队长和他的小队的故事。这是斯大林格勒保卫战最后几个星期间，德军节节进迫的当儿，他们守卫这三所房子的故事。没有辞藻，没有夸张，没有空想，这个故事是一如日常生活的朴素讲出来的。
