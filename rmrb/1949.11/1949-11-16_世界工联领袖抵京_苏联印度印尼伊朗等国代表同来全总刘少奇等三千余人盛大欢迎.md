Louis Saillant and the WFTU Vice Presidents will hold the WFTU Executive Bureau meeting and preside over the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference in Beijing. Saillant and his delegation received a warm welcome at the station.

Those who went to welcome them included: Honorary Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU) Liu Shaoqi, Chairman Chen Yun, Vice Chairmen Li Lisan and Zhu Xuefan; Zhou Enlai (Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government) representative and Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Li Kenong; Deputy Director of the General Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government, Yan Baohang; Secretary of the Central Committee of the New Democratic Youth League of China, Feng Wenbin; Deputy Secretary Jiang Nanxiang; Chairwoman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, Cai Chang; Chairman of the All-China Students' Federation, Xie Bangding; Director-General of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, Qian Junrui; Mayor of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, Nie Rongzhen; Representative of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, Liu Ren; members of the preparatory committees for the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference and the Asian Women's Representative Conference already in Beijing; and Counsellor of the Soviet Embassy in China, Shibaev, Tikhvinsky, and others. ACFTU Vice Chairman Liu Ningyi had personally gone to Shenyang to welcome Saillant and his delegation and accompanied them to Beijing.

After getting off the train, Saillant and his delegation shook hands with the welcomers one by one, accepted flowers from various people's organizations, and immediately participated in a welcome rally held by the ACFTU, the New Democratic Youth League of China, the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, the Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions, and other organizations, with over three thousand people in attendance.

In his welcome speech, Honorary Chairman of the ACFTU Liu Shaoqi said: "Due to the victory of the Chinese People's Great Revolution, the WFTU Executive Bureau, as the center of solidarity for the world working class, has come to China to convene a meeting and will hold the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference here, enabling the Chinese working class to unite freely with the working classes of all countries and carry out a common struggle. The joy and excitement of the Chinese workers are indescribable."

Louis Saillant, WFTU Vice President Kuznetsov's representative, Soloviev (one of the Secretaries of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions), and Shelvankar (representative of the All India Trade Union Congress) spoke successively amidst warm applause.

In his speech, Louis Saillant said: "The WFTU supports all oppressed nations around the world in their struggle against imperialism. Only nations that love freedom can be liberated. Our arrival in Beijing today is a very good answer to those who provoke world war."

Soloviev said: "The Soviet people are the loyal friends of the Chinese people. Our two great countries are linked by an unbreakable friendship, which will continue to be strengthened and developed in the future. We sincerely hope that the working people of China and all the Chinese people can victoriously build a new and happy life, and we sincerely hope that the young People's Republic of China will become increasingly prosperous."

Shelvankar said: "For the past twenty years, the Indian people have watched with envy the Chinese people's struggle against imperialism and its running dog Chiang Kai-shek. All the measures you have taken under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong have been admired and watched by the Indian people. How happy the Indian people are about your victory today! In the homes of revolutionary workers in India today, you can see pictures of Mao Zedong and Zhu De alongside images of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin."

He said: "Your glorious struggle has pointed out two different paths to the Indian people: one is Chiang Kai-shek's path of surrendering to imperialism and selling out the motherland, and the other is Mao Zedong's path of uncompromising struggle against imperialism until they take their destiny into their own hands. Today, Nehru is following Chiang Kai-shek's path, while the Indian people have resolutely chosen Mao Zedong's path."

Shelvankar concluded by shouting slogans such as "Long live Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese and Southeast Asian people!"
