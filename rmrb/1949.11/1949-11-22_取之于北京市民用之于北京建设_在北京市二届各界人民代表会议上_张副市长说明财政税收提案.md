Taken from Beijing Citizens, Used for Beijing Construction
Vice Mayor Zhang Explains Financial and Tax Proposals at the Second Session of the Beijing Municipal People's Congress

[Beijing News] At the Second Session of the Beijing Municipal People's Congress, Vice Mayor Zhang Youyu gave the following explanation on the five financial and tax proposals of the Beijing Municipal People's Government:

Fellow Representatives:

The Beijing Municipal People's Government has submitted five tax proposals to the congress this time, which I will now explain on behalf of the municipal government.

Before explaining each proposal separately, I will first give a brief general explanation.

1.  As mentioned in Mayor Nie's report, Beijing has many necessary construction projects waiting to be done, such as sanitation, repairing sewers, building roads, etc., all of which require funds. Therefore, taxes need to be levied. Otherwise, we would have to increase the issuance of currency, which would not only affect the lives of citizens but also affect the development of industry and commerce itself.

2.  The taxes to be levied in the five tax proposals are all existing ones, not newly added ones. Some have only changed their names, such as house donation changed to property tax. These taxes should have been collected gradually, but because they are closely related to the vital interests of the people, we have conducted careful investigations and research, and submitted them to this session for discussion, in order to achieve fairness and reasonableness. I hope everyone will express their opinions as much as possible.

3.  Although the five tax proposals are submitted to this session for discussion at one time, they are not collected all at once. For example, the income tax and business tax on profit-making enterprises, and the progressive agricultural tax, are collected now, while the land tax will be collected later. On the other hand, the tax collection targets are also different: some are industrial and commercial households, some are farmers, some are property owners, and some are land owners.

4.  The tax collection methods we have proposed have been formulated after repeated and thorough research. For example, the property tax and land tax have been under study since June. These methods have now been discussed and approved by the consultation committee. However, there may still be improprieties. Even if the methods are appropriate, deviations may occur in the implementation. The government will strive to avoid deviations. If the people find problems, they can tell the government, and the government will definitely correct them.

5.  As Mayor Nie said in his report, our tax revenue is "taken from the people and used for the people," taken from the citizens of Beijing and used for the construction of Beijing. The people can supervise us, and can review us at the next meeting. If the money is used improperly, we can be impeached. Below, I will explain each of the five tax proposals separately.

    I. First proposal: Unified collection of income tax and business tax on profit-making enterprises

    (1) In the past, there were five types of taxes: income tax on profit-making enterprises, business tax, special business tax, business license tax, and interest income tax. Now, in order to simplify the tax system and take care of the difficulties of industrial and commercial households, we have abolished three of them, retained two, and adopted a combined and phased collection method.

    (2) The principle of setting tax rates is: 1. Develop production; 2. Support industries and businesses that are beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood. Therefore, the taxes levied on various industries and businesses vary in weight according to their nature.

    (3) There are only two collection methods: 1. Based on the accounts of industrial and commercial households; 2. Democratic appraisal. Generally speaking, the first method cannot be fully adopted because the accounts of industrial and commercial households in Beijing today are not accurate enough. Based on past experience, the method of combining democratic appraisal with investigation is more fair, reasonable, and practical. This time, we will still adopt this method.

    (4) The tax amount is twelve catties of millet per share. On the surface, it seems heavier than the last time (the last time the income tax was six catties and the business tax was two catties, a total of eight catties), but in reality, it is not that heavy. The last time we collected taxes for the second half of last year. At that time, the business conditions of most industrial and commercial households were not very good, so we levied taxes very lightly. This time, we are collecting taxes for the first half of this year, and the business situation has improved, so the tax amount should naturally be increased. Generally speaking, according to our investigation, it has not exceeded the general affordability of industrial and commercial households (and there are provisions for tax exemption for those whose taxable amount is less than one share).

    (5) In the past, municipal enterprises paid taxes to the city, while state-owned enterprises paid taxes to the former North China Government. Private industrial and commercial enterprises have expressed dissatisfaction with this. This time, we plan to make state-owned enterprises also pay taxes to the city.

    II. Second proposal: Levying a fixed-amount property tax

    (1) This tax is the former house donation.

    (2) Adopt a fixed-amount collection method: divide various houses into grades, and set a certain tax amount according to the house price index and rice price. Unless there are special changes in house prices, it will not be changed again. In this way, the government can estimate how much property tax can be collected, and the people can also estimate how much property tax they will pay, and the procedures are also simplified.

    (3) In the past, the tax rate for self-occupied houses was six-tenths of that for rental houses. Now, in order to encourage urban housing rentals, the tax rate for self-occupied houses will be increased to eight-tenths of that for rental houses.

    (4) Provide a three-year tax exemption for newly built houses to encourage house construction.

    (5) Public and private houses are subject to tax, except in special circumstances.

    (6) The tax is heavier in the city, lighter in the suburbs and towns, and not levied in purely rural areas, to encourage building houses outside the city.

    (7) Although the tax rate for self-occupied houses has increased, the government can grant discretionary reductions and exemptions to take care of the poor.

    III. Third proposal: Levying a fixed-amount land tax

    (1) This tax is the former land price tax.

    (2) The method and reasons for fixed-amount collection are the same as for property tax.

    (3) Different from property tax, land tax adopts progressive collection on excess amounts (the starting point for progression is one standard mu) to prevent the concentration of land.

    (4) Cultivated land in the city is not subject to land tax, but to agricultural tax.

    (5) Outside the city, in addition to cultivated land being subject to agricultural tax, land for building houses will not be taxed for the time being to encourage building houses outside the city, especially building factories outside the city.

    IV. Fourth proposal: Levying progressive agricultural tax

    (1) The collection of this tax is basically based on the methods of the former North China Government, and there is nothing that needs special explanation. The decision on the tax amount and disaster relief exemption amount has been made after repeated and detailed investigations. The former is set at 26 million catties of millet, and the latter is set at 4 million catties of millet, that is, 22 million catties of millet will be collected in reality.

    V. Fifth proposal: Levying small city primary school education fees and sanitation fees along with property tax, land tax, income tax and business tax on profit-making enterprises

    (1) The primary school education fees and sanitation fees in the city should be raised locally. It is proposed to adopt the method of levying a surcharge. 30% of property tax and land tax will be levied as a surcharge, and 10% of income tax and business tax will be levied as a surcharge to cover this expenditure. Education funds in suburban areas, etc., will be levied as a surcharge along with agricultural tax. As for the funds levied as a surcharge along with income tax and business tax on profit-making enterprises, etc. in the suburbs and towns belonging to the suburbs, they will be allocated to the suburbs for use.

    (2) At the last session of the People's Congress, I reported to the congress that the expenditure on primary school education and sanitation was about 20 million catties of millet, while now it is 20,762,610 catties. The numbers before and after are inconsistent. This is because the previous expenditure on primary schools and village offices totaled more than 19 million catties. Now, the expenditure on village offices is raised by the suburbs themselves, and the primary schools in the suburbs are also allocated to the suburbs, leaving only the expenditure on primary schools in the city, so it is less than what was said last time. However, only the expenditure on tools was budgeted for sanitation last time, so it was only 2 million catties, while now, because the salaries of more than 1,800 sanitation workers must also be paid from this expenditure, it has increased compared to last time.

The above is a brief explanation of the five tax proposals.

### 取之于北京市民用之于北京建设　在北京市二届各界人民代表会议上  张副市长说明财政税收提案

　　取之于北京市民用之于北京建设
　　在北京市二届各界人民代表会议上
    张副市长说明财政税收提案
    【北京讯】张友渔副市长在北京市第二届各界人民代表会议上对北京市人民政府五个财政税收提案的说明，全文如下：各位代表：
    这次北京市人民政府向大会提出五个征税案，我现在代表市政府加以说明。
    在分别说明各个提案以前，先简单做一个总的说明。
    一、在聂市长的报告中，已经提到，北京市有许多必要的建设工作待做，诸如卫生事业，修理下水道，建设马路等等，在在需款，因此，就需要征税。不然，就得增加通货的发行，这样，不但会影响市民生活，也将影响工商业本身的发展。
    二、五个征税案中所要征的税，都是原来就有的，并非新增加的。有的，只是改了名称，如房捐改为房产税。这些税，本应陆续征收，但因关系人民切身利害，故做了慎重的调查研究，提交本届会议讨论，以期做到公平合理。希望大家尽量发表意见。
    三、五个征税案虽向本届会议一次提出讨论，但并不是一道征收。例如营利事业所得税和营业税，农业累进税，是现在就征，而地产税则是以后才征。另一方面，各种税的征收对象，也不同：有工商业户，有农民，有房产所有者，有地产所有者。
    四、我们所提出的征税办法是经过一再周详研究，才拟定了的。例如房产税、地产税便是从六月间起，即已开始研究了的。现在这些办法已经协商委员会讨论通过。但还可能有不妥当处。即使办法妥当，在执行中，也可能发生偏差。在政府方面，当力求避免发生偏差。在人民方面，如发现毛病，可以告诉政府，政府一定予以纠正。
    五、如聂市长报告所说，我们的税收，是“取之于人民，用之于人民”的，取之于北京市民，用之于北京建设的。人民可以监督我们，在下次会议上可以检查我们，如用之不当，可以弹劾。以下，再就五个征税案分别说明。
    　　　　一、第一案：统一征收营利事业所得税和营业税
    （一）过去原有营利事业所得税，营业税，特种营业税，营业牌照税，利息所得税等五种税，现为简化税制，并为照顾工商业户的困难，特取消了其中三种，保留两种，并采取合并分期征收办法。
    （二）税率拟定原则，是：一、发展生产；二、扶助有利于国计民生的工商业，故对各种工商业所征的税，依其性质不同，而有所轻重。
    （三）征收方法不外两种：一、根据工商业户帐目，二、民主评议。第一种方法，一般的说，由于今天北京工商业户的帐目还不够精确，故不能完全采用。根据上次经验，用民主评议与调查相结合的办法，比较公平合理，切实可行。这次，仍是采取这种办法。
    （四）税额每分十二斤小米，表面上好象较上次重了（上次所得税六斤，营业税二斤，共八斤），但实际上并不算重。上次征收的是去年下半年的税。那时一般工商业户的营业状况是不太好的，所以我们征税特别轻。这次征的是今年上半年的税，营业情况已经好转，税额当然应提高，就一般工商业户来说，根据我们调查，并未超过一般的负担能力（且有纳税额不满一分者免税的规定）。
    （五）过去，市营企业向市纳税，国营的则向前华北政府纳税。私营工商业对此曾表示不满。这次，拟使国营企业也向市里纳税。
    　　　　二、第二案：征收定额房产税
    （一）此税即系过去的房捐。
    （二）采取定额征收办法：把各种房子分出等级，按房价指数与米价，规定一定税额，非遇房价有特殊变动时，不再改变。这样，政府可以预计能够收入多少房产税，人民也可以预计付出多少房产税，并且在手续上也简化了。
    （三）过去自住房屋纳税为出租房屋十分之六，现为鼓励城市房屋出租，将自住房屋税额提高到出租房屋的十分之八。
    （四）规定新建房屋，免税三年，以鼓励建房。
    （五）公私房屋，除特殊情况外，一律纳税。
    （六）城内税重，关厢、镇税轻，纯农村不征，鼓励在城外建房。
    （七）自用房屋，虽税率提高，但为照顾贫寒，政府可予酌情减免。
    　　　　　三、第三案：征收定额地产税
    （一）此税即系过去的地价税。
    （二）定额征收，办法、理由与房产税同。
    （三）与房产税不同的，是地产税采取超额累进征收（累进起点为一标准亩），以防止土地的集中。
    （四）城内耕地不征地产税，而征农业税。
    （五）城外除耕地征农业税外，建屋用地，暂不征税，以鼓励城外建屋，特别是在城外建工厂。
    　　　　四、第四案：征收农业累进税
    （一）这税的征收，基本上是根据前华北政府的办法，没有什么需要特别说明的。关于税额与灾情减免额的决定，是经过三番五次详细调查的。前者定为二千六百万斤小米，后者定为四百万斤小米，即实征二千二百万斤小米。
    　　　　五、第五案：随房产税地产税营利事业所得税与营业税附征城内小
    　　学教育费及清洁卫生费
    （一）城内小学教育费及清洁卫生费，应由地方自筹。拟采用附征办法，房产税、地产税征附征百分之三十，所得税营业税附征百分之十，以充此项经费，郊区教育经费等，则随农业税附征。至于在属于郊区的关厢镇等，随营利事业所得税及营业税等所附征的经费，则划归郊区用。
    （二）在上届各界人民代表会议上，我曾向大会报告，小学教育及清洁卫生等经费的开支约二千万斤小米，而现在则为二千零七十六万二千六百一十斤，前后数字不符。这是因为上次小学及村公所经费共一千九百余万斤，现在，村公所经费由郊区自筹，而关厢小学也划归郊区，只剩城内小学的经费，故较上次所说减少了，但清洁卫生费则上次只预算到工具支出，故仅二百万斤，而现在，因清洁队员一千八百余人工资亦须由此项经费内开支，故较上次增加了。
    以上是关于五个征税案的简单说明。
