American Imperialism in Taiwan
By Ke Liming, Translated by Da Tian

Taiwan has become front-page news in the world's newspapers at this stage, and the heads of the Kuomintang reactionaries, senior government officials, and their families are all using this island as a refuge. The Kuomintang authorities are shipping documents, important items, and foreign gold and silver deposits to Taiwan by the boatload. Newspapers also report that many new American naval and air forces have recently arrived in Taiwan to quickly deploy the Kuomintang army, trained and equipped by American instructors hired by Chiang Kai-shek, to the battlefield.

Taiwan is two hundred kilometers from the mainland and occupies a very important position in the U.S. imperialist's invasion plans. They have designated both Taiwan and South Korea as major strategic bases in the future confrontation against democratic China.

Immediately after the Soviet Navy and Army inflicted a fatal blow on the Kwantung Army, forcing Japan to surrender, the United States, through the Kuomintang government, controlled Taiwan, turning it into the "Hawaii of the Far East."

With Chiang Kai-shek's consent, American generals turned Taiwan into a center for training Kuomintang troops and recruited many Japanese officials.

American capital has penetrated every economic sector in Taiwan, monopolizing the economic lifeline of Taiwan.

A rough outline of American control can be gleaned from the extremely incomplete facts revealed by the newspapers. On October 14, 1948, the China Press reported that Reynolds Metals Company monopolized the entire aluminum industry in Taiwan, investing $34 million to rebuild and control the Kaohsiung aluminum plant, one of the largest in East Asia. A company spokesperson declared that annual production would increase to 25,000 tons. Most importantly, the aircraft manufacturing plant closely related to the aluminum industry has seen tremendous development under American control. The China Press also reported that the United States had completed the construction of the Third Aircraft Manufacturing Plant in Taichung.

Westinghouse Electric Corporation is the second largest monopoly organization operating in Taiwan. It controlled the Taiwan Electric Power Company shortly before signing a contract with the company to restore damaged power plants and increase power generation. Now, Westinghouse has virtually complete control of the island's thirty-four power plants, including the largest one in Tainan.

The American state-owned fertilizer company monopolizes the manufacture of soda, mainly for export to Japan. Two other American companies monopolize the manufacture of chemical fertilizers. Oil companies have obtained the rights to oil extraction in the southern part of the island. American companies are also engaged in the mining of copper and gold. The cement industry is monopolized by Universal American Transportation Corporation, largely supplying construction for Pacific bases.

Taiwan's sugar industry is extremely well-known, with production reaching one million tons in 1941 and 1942. American companies invested in the local sugar industry, local industrialists were squeezed out, and more than sixty percent of the sugar refining industry has fallen into American hands. Large amounts of capital have been invested in transportation, camphor, paper, salt, cement, and other industries. In Kaohsiung, American capitalists rebuilt and expanded docks, shipyards, and oil refineries.

The Taiwanese industries that have been rebuilt or acquired by American capital mentioned here are extremely incomplete. In addition, 382 Taiwanese industrial and commercial enterprises are directly or indirectly controlled by 22 Sino-American joint ventures. In these 22 companies, Chinese comprador capital only occupies a secondary position.

Taiwan's agriculture has also not escaped the attention of U.S. imperialism. Their policy towards Taiwan is to hinder the development of productive forces and encourage the independent development of agriculture. Regardless of the severe food panic experienced by the people, vast areas are planted with camphor trees and sugarcane, which are extremely profitable for American manufacturers.

American imperialists not only use economic means to control Taiwan, they are also very secretly arming the island. No one can freely enter or leave Taiwan without the permission of the secret police. To suit their own purposes, the American military in Taiwan is working hard to expand light-duty ports, paying particular attention to Kaohsiung. The Kuomintang authorities are providing their protectors with various assistance from overseas, dutifully seizing thousands of Chinese people to build airports, docks, and harbors for them.

Now, American military airfields can be found in every part of the island. American authorities are establishing huge air stations there. According to Chinese newspapers, the U.S. Thirteenth Air Force had already entered the area in October 1948; the Taichung airport, which supplies the Flying Tigers, was also opened at the end of 1947. A very large American naval base has been built four kilometers north of Kaohsiung, and a similar base is being built in Keelung in northern Taiwan.

In the construction of naval and air force bases and various economic sectors, American aggressors have hired a large number of Japanese experts. In the industrial sector alone, they have hired more than 10,000 engineers, technicians, foremen, and company agents, including Hesegawa, the former Japanese Governor of Taiwan, Aikawa, an important financial representative, and the former head of Japanese industry in Manchuria.

U.S. imperialism is attempting to take advantage of the fact that a peace treaty with Japan has not yet been signed to conspire to seize Taiwan from China. Reactionary American newspapers emphasize the importance of Taiwan to the "defense" of the United States, and American expansionists openly demand the occupation of Taiwan. For example, Alsop wrote in the New York Herald Tribune on April 5, 1949, that he insisted the United States must rule Taiwan, even if it is an "immoral act."

The New York Times correspondent in London reported on May 25 that the U.S. and British governments are considering a Taiwan legal issue. The New York Times made a clever excuse for this, arguing that although the Cairo Declaration of 1943 stipulated that Taiwan should be returned to China, it still belongs to Japan until a peace treaty with Japan is signed.

According to the American plan for Taiwan, American diplomatic and military personnel in Taiwan are busy advocating a separatist movement among the local masses. "Taiwanese have no natural connection with China" was the slogan of this movement formulated by American newspapers at the end of last year. It has only been supported by a very small number of Taiwanese reactionaries. American authorities organized a so-called Taiwan Restoration League. This newborn thing does not yet dare to openly propose American military occupation of Taiwan. Recently, it has been clamoring for the attention of the United Nations, calling for the island to be occupied by United Nations forces. Naturally, this armed force will include the American troops that have long ruled Taiwan.

At the end of 1948, the Hong Kong China Merchants Daily made the following description of the United States:

"Control Taiwan and assist the pro-American faction in establishing a 'Taiwanese independent government' to reduce Taiwan to a second South Korea."

This clearly spells out the expansionist plans of the U.S. imperialists.

### 美帝国主义在台湾

    美帝国主义在台湾
    克列明作  达天译
    台湾已成为现阶段世界报纸的头版新闻，国民党反动派头子、高级政府官员和其家属们，都把这个岛当成避难所。国民党当局把公文、要件和国外金银存款一船一船运到台湾。报纸也报导说，为了使蒋介石聘请美国教师所训练和装备的国民党军队迅速调赴战场，美国有很多海军、空军新近到达台湾。
    台湾距大陆二百公里，在美帝的侵略计划中占很重要的地位。他们把台湾和南韩都划作将来对抗民主中国中的主要战略基地。
    紧接着由于苏联海军陆军给予关东军以致命打击，迫使日本投降以后，美国就通过国民党政府控制了台湾，变成“远东夏威夷”。
    美国将军们在取得蒋介石同意下，把台湾变成了训练国民党军队的中心，并且征募了很多日本官吏。
    美国资本无孔不入，打入了台湾每一个经济部门，垄断了台湾的经济命脉。
    从报纸透露的极不完全的事实上，可以获得美国控制的大略。一九四八年十月十四日西华报载，莱诺金属公司垄断了台湾全部制铝工业，投资达三千四百万美元，重建并掌握了东亚最大之一的高雄制铝厂，该公司发言人宣称年产量将增到二万五千吨。最重要的是与铝工业有密切关系的飞机制造厂在美国控制下的巨大发展。西华报同时报导美国已完成台中第三飞机制造厂的建设。
    西屋电气公司是在台湾活动的第二大垄断组织。在和台湾电气公司订立恢复被毁的电厂和增加发电量的合同前不久，就控制了该公司。到现在西屋公司实际上已经完全控制了该岛的三十四个发电厂，包括台南的最大的一个。
    美国国营肥料公司独占了苏打的制造，主要是向日本输出。另外两个美国公司独占了化学肥料的制造。油类公司获得了该岛南部的油类开采权。美国公司也正在进行铜矿金矿的开采。水泥工业被通用美国运输公司所垄断，大部供给太平洋基地的建筑。
    台湾的制糖工业是极著名的，一九四一到四二年产量曾达到一百万吨。美国公司投资本地制糖工业，本地工业家受到排挤，百分之六十以上的炼糖业已握到美国人手里。大量资本投入了运输、樟脑、纸、盐、水泥等工业。在高雄，美国资本家重建并扩展了船坞、造船厂和炼油业。
    这里所举出来的被美国资本重建或获得的台湾工业，是极不充分的。此外有三八二家台湾工商企业直接或间接地受二十二家中美混合公司所控制，二十二家公司中，中国的买办资本只占次要地位。
    台湾农业也逃不掉美帝的注意，他们对台湾的政策是阻滞生产力的发达和鼓励农业的单独发展。不管人民正经历着严重的粮食恐慌，广大的地区却种植了樟脑树和甘庶，这对美国厂家利润是极丰富的。
    美帝国主义者不仅用经济统治台湾，他们正非常秘密地武装该岛，没有秘密警察的许可，任何人都不能随便进出台湾。为了适合他们自己的目的，台湾的美军正在努力扩张？轻便港口，特别注意高雄。国民党当局正从海外给予其保护者各种协助，孝顺地抓到成千的中国人民替他们建筑飞机场和船坞、港湾。
    现在在该岛的每一个部分都可以找到美军飞机场。美国当局在那儿建立巨大的航空站，据中国报载，美国第十三航空队已经于一九四八年十月进驻该处；供给飞虎队的台中机场也在一九四七年底开放。在高雄北边四公里的地方已经建筑了一个极大的美国海军基地，台湾北部的基隆也正在修建一个类似的基地。
    在海军空军基地的建造和各种经济活动部门中，美国侵略者大量雇用日本专家，仅仅工业部门，就雇用了一万以上的工程师、技术人员、工头和公司代理人，其中有赫斯加瓦，以前日本的台湾总督艾卡瓦，重要财政界代表和前日本驻满洲工业首脑。
    美帝正企图利用对日和约尚未订立的这一事实，阴谋从中国夺取台湾。反动的美国报纸强调台湾对“防卫”美国的重要性，美国扩张主义者们公开要求占领台湾。例如亚尔索普在一九四九年四月五日的纽约先驱论坛报上就这样写过，他坚持美国必须统治台湾，即令这是一种“不道德的行动”。
    纽约时报驻伦敦记者五月二十五日报导：美英政府正考虑一次台湾法规问题。对这，纽约时报制造了一项巧妙的理由。认为固然根据一九四三年的开罗宣言，台湾应归还中国，但在对日和约未签订以前，仍属日本领土。
    根据美国对台湾的计划，美国在台的外交和军事人员正忙于在本地群众中鼓吹一个分裂运动。“台湾人与中国没有天然联系”是美国报纸在去年年底所制定的对这一运动的口号，只受到极少数台湾反动派的拥护，美国当局组织了一个所谓台湾光复同盟，这个新出生的东西还不敢明目张胆地提出美军占领台湾。最近却叫嚣着提请联合国注意，由联合国军队占领该岛。自然，这一支武装力量将包括早已统治台湾的美国军队。
    一九四八年年底香港华商报对美国作过如下的叙述：
    “控制台湾和协助亲美派成立一个“台湾独立政府”把台湾降为第二个南韩。”
    这就很清楚地写出了美帝国主义者的扩张计划。
