　　Dongting Lake Bandit Gangs Completely Eliminated
　　Merchants and Travelers Unimpeded, Fishermen Find it Convenient
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The bandit gangs inside Hunan's Dongting Lake have been completely eliminated. In the past, banditry was a persistent problem in areas within the lake such as Junshan, Langshan and Mingshan. This time, the Second Battalion of the Second Detachment of the Changde Military Subdistrict of the province was ordered to carry out suppression. The bandits immediately fragmented into smaller groups and concealed their activities. The Second Battalion's soldiers then adopted a tactic of dispersing to counter the dispersed bandits, blockading the landing docks along the lake. In the lake, they used steamships as command posts, navigating small boats to search and annihilate the bandits everywhere, maintaining contact with each other. In this way, within a week, they captured fifty habitual bandits and Kuomintang military secret agents, including Zhou Fengxiang, the third grand captain of the Kuomintang puppet guerrilla column, Chief of Staff Cai Chunsheng, and company commander Wang Zhongbao. The habitual bandits in the lake, fearing the might of our army in Zi River, surrendered to us. Habitual bandits Liu Tongyi, Ding Guodong and eight others were captured. Due to a series of victories, the masses gradually overcame their concerns, voluntarily reported bandit activities in secret, and launched a military-civilian joint bandit suppression movement. After a month of suppression by the battalion, as of the tenth of this month, the original bandit gangs within Dongting Lake, except for individual scattered bandits, have been completely eliminated. At present, navigation within the lake is smooth and unhindered for merchants and travelers. Fishermen are also actively repairing their fishing nets, preparing to enter the lake for fishing.

　　洞庭湖股匪已全部肃清
　　商旅无阻渔家称便
    【本报讯】湖南洞庭湖内的股匪已告肃清。过去，湖内军山、郎山、明山等地，历年匪患未绝。此次该省常德军分区二支队二营奉令进剿，土匪即化整为零，隐蔽活动，二营战士乃采取以分散对分散方式，封锁沿湖登陆渡口，在湖中以汽船为指挥所，驾小船分散搜索，互相联系，到处追歼。这样，在一个星期内即捕获惯匪及国民党军统特务共五十名，内有国民党伪游击纵队第三大队长周凤祥、参谋长蔡春生、中队长王忠保等，湖内惯匪于资水慑于我军威势，向我投降。惯匪刘同益、丁国栋等八名被擒。由于一连串的胜利，群众逐渐打破顾虑，自动密报匪情，掀起军民合作剿匪运动。经过该营一个月的清剿，至本月十日止，洞庭湖内除个别零星散匪外，原有股匪已告肃清。目前湖内航运畅通，商旅无阻，渔民也积极修补鱼网，准备入湖捕鱼。
