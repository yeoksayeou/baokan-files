Today's Lüda
——Dalian Communications IV
By Our Correspondent Tian Liu
    From the day I arrived in Dalian, an inexplicable but very joyful emotion often floated in my mind, and it became stronger day by day. Gradually, I discovered that this was a genuine sense of envy arising from the depths of my heart.
    According to the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance, the Soviet army was stationed in the Lüshun area for thirty years to prevent the resurgence of Eastern aggressors. The people of Lüda therefore received direct and close assistance from the Soviet troops. In just four years, Dalian has been transformed into a happy new city.
    For four years, the million people of Lüda, in the peaceful environment defended by the Soviet army, have been able to rebuild their lives worry-free and single-mindedly. In those most difficult days, when Chiang Kai-shek blockaded Lüda from the sea and land, the Soviet army transported large quantities of food, rescuing millions of people from starvation; when the People's Liberation Army smashed Chiang bandit's blockade and the recovery of industry became possible, the Soviet army helped Lüda train thousands of cadres and tens of thousands of technical workers, and spread their advanced experience in industrial construction to the people of Lüda. This advanced technology and experience, combined with the ever-increasing production enthusiasm of the working class under the leadership of the Communist Party, became an incomparably powerful force, rapidly healing the wounds of Japanese sabotage, and Lüda's industry began to advance by leaps and bounds. Now the technical capacity of Lüda's industry has reached such a level that things the Japanese could not manufacture, Lüda workers have manufactured. Many factories have exceeded the highest production levels during the Japanese rule. New factories have been established and continue to be established. Last year, the value of industrial, agricultural, and fishery production in the Lüda area was 3.75 times the total consumption of the entire area, with industrial production accounting for 89 percent. It is not yet time to summarize this year. According to the materials from eighteen factories in the first half of the year alone, the average exceeded the production plan by 22 percent. The production value of the twenty-odd factories under the Industrial Bureau in the first half of the year was equivalent to more than 195.5 percent of the same period last year. In Lüda, the phenomenon of worker unemployment has been basically eliminated, beggars have long disappeared, and prices have fallen by 30 to 50 percent this year. Workers' wages have not decreased with the decline in prices; on the contrary, they have increased with the increase in production. All major factories have their own hospitals, bathhouses, barber shops, public canteens, collective dormitories... Workers can go to see a doctor and take a bath for free, and can get a full meal in the public canteen for twelve or thirteen yuan. I visited the collective dormitory for workers of the Dalian Transportation Company, which the workers call the "Workers' Home." The dormitory is in a huge "U"-shaped two-story building. The floors are red and bright, the walls are gleaming white, and the sun shines in through the glass windows, making the neat bedding on each worker's bed shine. Each room has heating. In addition to the workers' living quarters, the dormitory also has a beautifully decorated auditorium that can accommodate a thousand people. There is a library with more than 5,000 books and more than 20 magazines. There are four large exhibition halls, two for the company's engineering and business exhibitions, and two for the automobile and tram factories' exhibitions. Inside are displayed various statistical charts and more than a hundred products created by the workers. There are four or five large classrooms, where each worker studies for four hours a day, with courses in geography, nature, mathematics, business, and politics. Teachers are hired by the company at its expense. In addition, there is also a large bathhouse heated by electricity and an exquisite barber shop, where workers can take a bath every five days and get a haircut every three weeks, all free of charge. The public canteen is spacious and clean. The bowls and chopsticks are a fixed set for each person, and after use, they are placed in a specially made small box. Three meals a day, with rice and meat once or twice a week, cost only 1,400 to 1,500 yuan per person per month. In the large courtyard surrounded by red buildings, there are two pavilions. When I visited, a study group was reviewing their lessons there. A little further away is a fishing pond, with stone tables and stools. In the center of the courtyard is a large fountain pool. Water droplets more than ten feet high shatter and fall into the pool full of aquatic plants, where small fish are swimming peacefully and contentedly. Next to it stands a memorial tower more than twenty feet high, inscribed with "Create the World," which was built by the workers themselves last October to commemorate the completion of the "Workers' Home." At the top of the tower is a steel globe, with the eleven large characters "Workers of all countries, unite!" emitting a dazzling light. Surrounding these many buildings are various flowers, and further away is a large sports field equipped with football, basketball, volleyball, parallel bars, vaulting horses, sky bridges, swings... I once asked a worker comrade: "Do you have any worries now?" Unexpectedly, he said to me: "Yes!" Then he explained to me: "I am worried that I will not become a model worker."
    With the development of production, everything has changed. The cultural life of the people of Lüda, like changes in other areas, is also becoming increasingly abundant. There are now 527 elementary schools in the entire area, where 147,510 children are happily learning. There are eight middle schools, two normal schools, and one university. The two-year economic construction plan will be completed next year, at which time the existing 300,000 adult illiterates will be basically eliminated. Regular literacy schools, literacy classes, and decentralized literacy groups are everywhere. Currently, 201,173 people have been organized into literacy classes to study (including 113,594 women). Students generally know more than 300 characters. Each factory also has technical schools, clubs, theater troupes, and bands, and each city, county, district, and town has cultural palaces, cultural centers, and cultural stations. When the working people reclaim the culture and art that was stolen from them by the oppressors, culture and art themselves will restore their original glory. The play "Er Mao's Meritorious Service" caused a sensation in Lüda. Its author is Wang Shuiting, a blacksmith worker from the canal. This July, he was invited as a laboring people's artist to participate in the drama performance organized by the National First Literary Congress.
    On October 2nd, I further saw the strength of the people of Lüda. 120,000 people in Dalian City gathered to celebrate the birth of the great motherland and hold a demonstration to defend world peace. The fact that so many people participated in the conference in a city with a population of less than 300,000 is enough to show the people's love for the motherland and their determination to defend peace. In particular, the fact that 120,000 people arrived on time, not a minute late, according to the scheduled time, is enough to show the strong organization and strength of the people of Lüda. The celebration of the birth of the motherland continued until the evening of the second day, the 3rd, without any sign of abatement. All the squares, parks, and clubs were crowded with celebrating crowds. In Labor Park alone, there were 50,000 to 60,000 people playing at the same time. Colorful fireworks danced in the night sky, illuminating the jubilant crowds. Many people were watching operas, many people were singing, and even more people were surrounding clusters of Yangko dance teams. At the open-air dance floor, a large dance party of more than 3,000 people was being held, with workers, farmers, students, and citizens, Chinese and Soviet people, all singing together, dancing together, and rejoicing together. Everyone had one feeling: celebrating the birth of the great people's motherland! Everyone had one will: defending world peace.

    今日旅大
    ——大连通讯之四
    本报记者  田流
    从我来到大连那天起，一种莫名的却是十分喜悦的情绪便常在心头浮动，而且一天比一天强烈起来。慢慢地，我发现这是一种由心的深处发出来的真实的羡慕。
    按照中苏友好同盟条约，苏军在旅顺地区驻军三十年，以防东方侵略者再起。旅大人民因此获得了苏联驻军直接、亲切的帮助。仅仅四年的工夫，大连已经变成幸福的新的城市了。
    四年来，旅大百万人民在苏军捍卫着的和平环境中，无忧无虑专心一志的重建自己的生活。在那最困苦的日子，蒋介石从海上陆上封锁起旅大的时候，苏军运来了大批食粮，将百万人民从饥饿中拯救出来；当人民解放军打碎了蒋匪封锁，恢复工业已成为可能时，苏军又帮助旅大培养了上千的干部和上万的技术工人，并把他们建设工业的先进经验，传播给旅大人民。这种先进的技术与经验，和在共产党领导下日益觉悟的工人阶级的生产热情一结合，就成为雄伟无比的力量，迅速医治了日寇破坏的创伤，旅大的工业开始大步前进了。现在旅大工业的技术能力已经达到这样的程度：日本人不能制造的东西，旅大工人制造出来了，有好多工厂已超过了日寇统治时期的最高生产水平。新的工厂已经建立起来并继续建立着。去年旅大地区工、农、渔业生产价值等于全区消费总额的三·七五倍，其中工业生产价值占百分之八十九。今年还不到总结的时候。仅据十八个工厂上半年的材料显示，平均超过生产计划百分之二十二，工业厅所属的二十多个工厂，上半年的生产价值相当去年同期的百分之一九五·五以上。在旅大，工人失业的现象已经基本消减，乞丐早已绝迹，物价今年已下降百分之三十到五十。工人的工资没有随着物价下降而降底，恰恰相反，它随着生产的提高而提高了。各大工厂都有自己的医院、澡塘、理发馆、公共食堂、集体宿舍……工人们可以免费去治病、洗澡，用十二、三元钱可以得到公共食堂一顿饱餐。我曾参观了大连交通公司工人的集体宿舍，工人们叫他作“工人之家”。宿舍在一所巨大的“凹”字形的二层楼房里，地板红亮，墙壁放着白光，太阳从玻璃窗中射进来，使每个工人床铺上整洁的被服，都放着光辉。每个房间都有暖气装置。这所宿舍，除有工人的住室外，还有一所容纳千人装璜美丽的大礼堂。有一个拥有五千多册图书二十多种杂志的图书馆。有四个大展览室，两个是全公司的工务和业务展览室，两个是汽车工厂和电车工厂的展览室，那里面陈列着各种统计图表和工人们创造的百余件产品。有四、五个大教室，每个工人一天在里面学习四个点头，课程有地理、自然、数学、业务和政治等，教员是由公司出钱聘请的。此外还有一个很大的用电力烧的澡塘和精致的理发馆，工人们可以五天洗一次澡、三周理一次发，这些都是免费的。公共食堂宽大清洁，碗筷都是固定的一份，用过后就装入特制的小箱，一日三餐，每周吃一、二次大米和肉，每人每月只缴一千四、五百元的饭费。在红色楼房环抱的大庭院中有两个凉亭，我去参观时，一个学习小组正在那里复习功课；旁边稍远是座渔池，还有石桌石凳等，院中央是一个大喷水池。高达丈余的水珠碎落在生满水草的池子里，小鱼正在那里安然自得的游泳。旁边矗立着一座高达两丈的写着“创造世界”的纪念塔，是去年十月为纪念“工人之家”落成，由工人自己建立的。塔顶有一个钢造地球，“全世界无产阶级联合起来！”十一个大字，发出耀目的光辉。在这许多建筑物周围是各种花卉，再远处是设有足球、篮球、排球、单杠、木马、天桥、秋千……的大运动场。我曾问一位工人同志：“你现在还有什么忧虑么？”出乎意外地他对我说：“有！”接着他即对我解释说：“我是忧虑我当不上模范。”
    随着生产的发展，一切都变样了，旅大人民的文化生活，和其他方面的变化一样，也日益丰盛起来。现在全区有五二七处小学，十四万七千五百一十名儿童在里面快乐地学习。有八所中学、两所师范和一所大学。两年经济建设计划将于明年完成，那时要基本上消灭现有的三十万成人文盲。正规的识字学校、识字班和分散的识字小组到处都有，现已有二十万一千一百七十三人组织进识字班里学习（内妇女十一万三千五百九十四人）。学员一般的都已识三百个字以上。每个工厂还有技术学校、俱乐部、剧团和乐队，各市县区镇有文化宫、文化馆和文化站的设置。当劳动人民从压迫者手中收回那被窃夺的文化与艺术之后，文化艺术本身也就恢复了她原来的光辉。“二毛立功”一剧哄动旅大，她的作者是船渠一位锻工工友王水亭。今年七月，他以劳动人民艺术家的资格被邀请参加了全国首届文代大会组织的戏剧演出。
    十月二日，我进一步看到了旅大人民的力量。大连市十二万人集会，庆祝伟大祖国的诞生和举行保卫世界和平的示威游行，一个不足三十万人口的城市里，有这样多的人参加大会，就足够说明人民对祖国的热爱和保卫和平的决心了。特别是十二万人都是按着预定时间、一分钟不差的准时到场，这一点，更足够说明旅大人民的坚强组织性和力量。庆祝祖国诞生的狂欢，直至第二日即三日晚，犹未稍减，各个广场、公园、俱乐部都挤满了狂欢的人群，仅劳动公园一处，同时在那里游玩者达五、六万人，五彩的焰火在夜空飞舞，照耀着欢腾的人群，许多人在看戏，许多人在唱歌，有更多的人包围着一簇簇的秧歌队。在露天跳舞场上，三千多人的大跳舞会在举行着，有工人、有农民、也有学生和市民，有中国人也有苏联人，大家唱在一起，舞在一起，欢乐在一起，所有的人一个心情：庆祝伟大人民祖国诞生！所有的人一个意志：保卫世界和平。
