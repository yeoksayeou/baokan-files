　　Here, Xi Lu once again looked for Lin Bao and the others to discuss investment, but everyone claimed to be short of money and declined to participate. After carefully considering it himself, he felt it would be too difficult to do it alone. However, he also thought that once the big kiln was opened, it would be a money tree, so he was indecisive and considered trying to do it alone. The initial capital was still quite short, but his wife was currently hauling some sand to Shizhuang, so maybe she could make up for some of the shortfall when she returned! Thinking this, he pulled out the abacus and began calculating with his eyes closed.
　　Unexpectedly, he had been so focused on the kiln that he hadn't paid much attention to market conditions. His wife had little experience, and this trip to the east didn't earn much money. She returned with some cloth, but it happened that cloth from Yangquan was plentiful, and most people in the surrounding villages had already bought cloth to make winter clothes in the previous few days. As a result, the price of cloth suddenly weakened, and Xi Lu's wife's cloth actually lost money. Xi Lu had never encountered such an unfavorable situation before. He was furious, and then hardened his heart, selling some of the goods from the Yangquan shop cheaply and taking out some loans, borrowing from two people at interest. Calculating that the initial capital shortfall wasn't too much, he called Da San and Yu Bao to go to Ju Bao's house, thinking: Ju Bao is also so concerned about this kiln, let's discuss it with him face to face. For the remaining funds, I'll just have to risk asking him to see what he says.
　　Sure enough! Ju Bao greeted them with a smiling face, bowing to Xi Lu with both hands and saying, "Congratulations, congratulations!" Xi Lu was polite for a while, then talked about the construction plan, and asked Da San and Yu Bao to explain the details. Ju Bao listened with his eyes closed, shaking his head, and humming, "Mm! Right! Good! Good!" Finally, he said, "Let's do it that way! Xi Lu, I'm relieved with you in charge." He then glared at Da San and said, "The technique depends entirely on you! Da San, this is a major event related to the success or failure of our Black Stone Slope community, our Zhang family! It's the first time in decades! I heard that you ruined someone else's kiln when you returned to the village last year, and you also wanted to leave some time ago, afraid you couldn't do it, and you went to the Yilitai mine in Xihe Village to look for work; being so half-hearted won't do! You have to do it properly for us! Do you hear me?" Da San was very angry and said, "I didn't ruin anyone's kiln last year! I wasn't afraid of failing some time ago! I said..." Ju Bao interrupted with a glare, saying, "Don't say anything! I know everything! You just do your best! You have to be clear! This isn't just Xi Lu's business! You're doing this for the whole village! Do you hear me?" Xi Lu felt that Da San had been wronged, but looking at Ju Bao's face, he didn't know what to say. Da San was very unhappy, turned his face away, didn't say a word, and stood aside. Ju Bao glared at him, then turned back to talk to Xi Lu with a smile.
　　Ju Bao said, "Xi Lu, I think, this time for the three big operas, hire a good troupe from the city, and the community will cover the expenses; and take advantage of the Worship of the Old Lord, you should host two good banquets, invite the big kiln owners, community leaders, and village chiefs from Liugou, Baiquan, and Xiao Xizhuang, and make it lively and grand, to add some glory to our village, what do you think?" Qian Da Nao and Yu Bao immediately clapped their hands in approval, but Xi Lu thought that if his initial capital was sufficient, that would be easy to say? But he's in trouble right now! His heart skipped a beat, and he smiled as he said, "It's okay, of course it's okay! It's what you ordered! Besides, I wouldn't dare let the community cover the opera expenses! But it's just..." and then told him about his financial difficulties. Ju Bao smiled and said, "Hey! Look at you... even if you're short on funds, you still have more ideas than me! Don't talk about this anymore." Xi Lu had to swear to himself, and Ju Bao frowned and sighed, "Oh! Look at this... I'm also short on funds these past two years..." Saying this, he asked Qian Da Nao, "Do you see any other way?" Qian Da Nao tilted his neck and pondered for a while, then approached Ju Bao, but said to Xi Lu, "See if we can get a couple from the Liugou kiln owner! Otherwise, there's no way. But his interest..." Ju Bao's eyebrows widened and said, "Okay! Xi Lu, I'll go talk to him. How much do you need? Will eighty hard coins do? His rules: deduct the interest in advance, monthly interest of five percent, that's it? Anyway, the kiln will see big profits before next spring." As Ju Bao spoke, he stood up, as if the matter was settled; Xi Lu regretted it and was unhappy, thinking if you don't help, then let me think of a way myself! How can you ask me to bear that high interest! But he couldn't say it clearly, so he rubbed and蹭蹭, stood up and muttered as he walked, "Oh... this, this..." At this moment, Da San suddenly waved his arm and said, "Brother Xi Lu! Rather than pay such high interest, it's better to save on operas and banquets, and just make sure the ventilation shaft is clear; for now, use your own initial capital first! I'll try my best to save. Anyway, operas and banquets are just jokes to join in the fun, that..." At this moment, Ju Bao's face, ears, and neck suddenly turned red, purple, and black. He pointed at Da San and shouted, "You're talking nonsense! I've heard that you don't respect the Old Lord! Good! This major event for our village and community for decades, you dare to say that? Good for you!" Saying this, he rushed two steps in front of Da San and shouted with a hoarse voice, "Are you trying to destroy our village and family? Are you relying on this to lead and open the kiln? You really have no regard for heaven and earth! Humph!" Xi Lu and Yu Bao were so frightened that they kept saying good things and apologizing to Ju Bao, but Qian Da Nao pushed Da San hard, and Da San fell to the ground, not saying a word. Ju Bao didn't listen to Xi Lu's pleas, and jumped a few steps to the table, slapping the table and scolding with saliva spraying from his mouth, "What is this! If the Old Lord doesn't punish you, we can't spare you! Don't you see where you're speaking? Do you want to rebel? Good! In the future, if something goes wrong with this big kiln, Da San, you'll be responsible! If something goes wrong with our village and family, you'll be responsible! Humph! You... can you be responsible? You're still a Zhang from Black Stone Slope Village! Qian Da Nao! Quickly prepare to strike the bell at the temple! Let this rebellious guy talk to our whole village community leaders! I can't bear it alone! Go, Yu Bao, help prepare too!" Qian Da Nao and Yu Bao obeyed and left. Ju Bao then turned to Xi Lu and said, "Xi Lu! Let Da San go to the temple and explain! If the community leaders say he's right, I, Ju Bao, will apologize and kneel before him! If not, let him be responsible for our whole village! I'll take care of running errands to figure out how much your initial capital is short. But one thing! Da San must open the kiln and clear the ventilation shaft. If there are any mistakes, I'll be the first to disagree! Go, you also prepare to go to the temple!" After speaking, Ju Bao called for Bai Quan's family to send boiled water and tobacco pills to drink. He was breathing heavily through his mouth and nose, and strode into the inner room. Xi Lu was so frightened that he was shivering. Bai Quan's family called him to drink water, but he didn't hear it. Suddenly, he saw Da San stand up abruptly and rush straight out with "thump, thump, thump" footsteps. He was greatly surprised and hurriedly shouted, "Da San!" He quickly ran after him.

　　黑石坡煤窑演义（１９）
    康濯
    这里喜禄又找林宝他们捣拉了一回，人们还都说是没有钱，推脱不干；他自己又再细敲慢打合计了一阵，觉得一个人干实在也是很作难。不过，他又觉得反正只要大窑开成，就是摇钱树，他又五心不定地想一个人也硬干下去。垫本嘛倒是差得不少，可他大小这时正拉了些砂货下石庄了，回来许能补上些吧！这么想着，他就又拉过算盘，闭着两眼合计起来。
    不想这些时他一心只在窑上头，买卖行情没多打问，他大小阅历又浅，这回去东边没赚什么钱；回来运了些布，却碰上来阳泉的布匹多，四乡添制冬衣的，又大多在前几天买下了布，因此市面布价突然疲下来，喜禄他大小的布，反倒赔了。喜禄从来也没有碰到过这样的不利，他生了一场气，后来就狠了狠心，把阳泉小铺的货贱卖了一些，又拉了点饥荒，出利钱借了两个，合计着垫本差也差得不太多，这天就叫上大三跟玉宝，一同上聚宝家去，心想：聚宝这会也这么关心这窑，咱跟他当面好好商议商议，所差的款项，只好豁出去找找他，看他怎么着。
    果然！聚宝满脸笑着迎接他们，双手直向喜禄拱着道：“恭喜恭喜！”喜禄也客气了一阵，就说了说动工的计划，又让大三玉宝各说了说详细情由；聚宝一边闭着眼摇头晃脑地听着，一边哼哈道：“嗯！对！好！好！”最后道：“就这么吧！喜禄爷！有你，我放心。”回头却又瞪着眼对大三道：“这把式上头就全凭你啦！大三，这可是咱黑石坡一社一村，咱张姓一门一户成败利害都关联着的大事，几十年头一回咧！听说你去年回村，是给人家闹坏了个窑，又说你前些时想走，怕干不成，你还去西河村义立泰矿上找营生来着；这么三心二意可不行！要给咱好好干！听见了么？”大三很生气，就道：“去年我并没坏人家的窑！前些时我也没怕闹不成！我是说……”聚宝却眼一横，插道：“甭说啦！我都知道！你反正尽心尽意干吧！你可闹清楚！这不是咱喜禄爷一个人的事！你这是给咱一村干咧！听见了么？”喜禄在一边觉着大三受了冤屈，但看看聚宝的脸，又不好说什么；大三挺没好气，就撇过脸去，哼也没哼，站到一边去了；聚宝朝他眼一横，才回头笑着又跟喜禄说话。
    聚宝说：“喜禄爷！我看，这回这三台大戏，去城里请个好班子，花销嘛咱社里给包上；再趁着敬老君爷，你给办上两桌好酒席，把柳沟、白泉、小西庄的大窑主们、社首村长们请请，闹它个热闹排场，也给咱村添点光彩，你看行么？”乾大脑跟玉宝忙拍巴掌叫好，喜禄却想到要是自己垫本充裕，那还不好说？可这会正困难嘛！他不觉心眼卜通，一边陪着笑道：“行可是行！你老人家吩咐的嘛！再说，唱戏吧也不敢让社里包罗！可就是……”一边就把他手头紧的情由告给了，聚宝却笑道：“嗨！你看你这是……你就手头紧吧，也总比我办法多呀！快别说这了。”喜禄只得手指自己当胸发誓，聚宝这才皱着眉头叹息道：“哎呀！你看这可是……我这二年手头也＠他妈的……”说着，他问乾大脑道：“你看还有法么？”乾大脑歪着脖了思谋了一会，凑近聚宝身边，可又对喜禄说：“看看柳沟大窑主那能对付两个不！别可没法。可就是他利钱……”聚宝眉头一展道：“行！喜禄爷，我去说说。你差多少？八十个硬的行啦？他的规矩：现扣利，月利五分，就那么吧？反正不等明年开春，窑就见大利的。”聚宝说着就站起来，象是事情办妥了一般；喜禄却又后悔又不高兴，心想你不帮忙，就让我自己想法么！怎么叫我去背那号利钱啊！但他又不好明说，只得摩摩蹭蹭地，也站起来一边走一边叨念着：“哎呀……这这……”这时大三却突然胳膊一挥，大撒手说道：“喜禄哥！与其吃这么大利，不如唱戏请客上头省着点，赶风筒透成了再说；这会就你那点垫本先动弹吧！我紧着省就是。反正唱戏请客也不过是凑热闹的耍笑事，那……”这时聚宝脸上、耳根和脖子都陡地一下发红发紫发黑，手指大三嚷道：“你胡说！我早就听说你不敬老君爷的！好！咱一村一社几十年的大事，你敢这么说？好家伙！”说着，他两步窜到大三跟前，破开嗓门骂道：“你是要毁了咱一村一姓？你就凭这带头当领事开窑？真是没天没地的！哼！”喜禄玉宝只吓得尽说好话跟聚宝陪情，乾大脑却狠狠地推了大三一把，大三往地下一圪＠，不言声了；聚宝却不听喜禄说情，几步跳到桌子跟前，往桌上拍着巴掌，满嘴喷着唾沫骂道：“什么东西！老君爷不罚你，咱也不能饶了你！你不看看你这是在哪里说话？你想要造反？好！往后这大窑要出了事，就是你大三担待！咱一村一姓要出了事，就是你担待！哼！你……你能担待？亏你还是个黑石坡村姓张的哩！乾大脑！快拾掇上庙敲钟！让这个想造反的家伙跟咱浑村社首们说说！我一个人可不敢担待！去，玉宝也帮着拾掇去！”乾大脑和玉宝听命走了，聚宝又转过来对喜禄道：“喜禄！让大三上庙说说理！看浑村社首们要说他有理，我聚宝就给他陪情下跪！要不，让他给咱浑村担待！你垫本短多短少的，我包揽跑腿想法。可一句话！大三一定得把窑开成，把风筒透开，要有差错的，我头一个不答应！去吧，你也拾掇上庙去！”说完，聚宝吆喝白泉家送来开水和烟丸喝了，满嘴满鼻孔直呼呼出着大气，就冲冲地进里间去了。喜禄吓得浑身哆嗦，白泉家叫他喝水，他也没听见；忽然，他见大三陡地一下立起，脚步“通通通”地直冲冲往外走了，他才大吃一惊，忙忙吆喝着：“大三！”紧步快跑追上去。
