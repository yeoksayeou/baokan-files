Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, October 30th: The first Nanjing Municipal Congress of the Communist Party of China was held from the 20th to the 25th of this month. The main agenda of the meeting was to unify thinking, strengthen unity, and reorganize the organization, in order to implement the six major tasks put forward by the East China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee. More than 600 representatives from the Communist Party organizations of various agencies, groups, and enterprises attended the meeting. The presidium of the congress was composed of 19 people including Tang Liang, Jiang Weiqing, He Yixiang, and Ke Qingshi. After listening to the reports by Tang Liang, Deputy Secretary of the Nanjing Municipal Party Committee, on reorganizing the Party organization, the importance of making the Party public, and how to successfully convene the Party Congress, the congress proceeded with group and plenary discussions. The representatives, adopting the method of linking theory with practice and launching criticism and self-criticism, after repeated discussions and in-depth research, unanimously realized that the main problem of the Nanjing Party today is to reorganize the Party internally from the ideological and organizational aspects, so that the Party can achieve complete consistency in ideology, politics, policies, and organization, and under the leadership of the Nanjing Municipal Party Committee, strengthen the Party's leadership and role, in order to better mobilize and organize the broad masses, implement the six major tasks of the East China Bureau specifically and correctly, overcome difficulties, and build a new Nanjing. The congress believed that the Party's work in Nanjing since its liberation half a year ago has been successful, but the shortcomings and individual mistakes are also quite serious. With the development of the victorious situation, there are certain phenomena of liberalism, bureaucracy, status consciousness, hedonism, uneasiness at work, and lack of organization and discipline within the Party. The congress made serious criticisms of the above-mentioned shortcomings and formulated correct methods for reorganizing the Party ideologically and organizationally. This method first clearly stipulates the principle of education as the main focus, using strengthened education to achieve the goal of raising the political awareness and class consciousness of Party members. At the same time, it stipulates that specific issues of Party members should be handled with the attitude of "learning from past mistakes to avoid future ones, curing the disease to save the patient, and being kind to others." The congress also stipulated that it is necessary to reorganize and improve the branches, strengthen branch life, and then focus on reviewing Party members, handling unresolved organizational issues, and carrying out the struggle against various anarchic and undisciplined phenomena. In order to strengthen the connection between the Party and the masses, the meeting decided to make the Party's organization public in a step-by-step manner, so that the Party can get the help of the broad masses and make the Nanjing Party healthier. On the last day of the congress, Deputy Secretary Tang Liang made a concluding report. In the report, after pointing out the gains of the congress, he called on all representatives to go back to convene Party and mass meetings to convey the significance and basic spirit of the congress and work together to build a new Nanjing.
