　　Beijing Municipal Second People's Representative Conference
　　Resolution on Closing Brothels
    [Beijing News] The Beijing Municipal Second People's Representative Conference passed the following resolution on closing brothels on its second day: Brothels are remnants of the beastly and barbaric system of old rulers and exploiters who devastated women's spirits and bodies, insulted women's personalities, spread syphilis and gonorrhea, and greatly endangered national health. Brothel owners, pimps, and usurers are extremely barbaric and vicious remnants of feudalism. Therefore, based on the will of the people of the city, it is decided to immediately close all brothels, concentrate all brothel owners, pimps, madams, etc. for investigation and handling, and concentrate prostitutes for training, transform their thinking, treat their venereal diseases, send those who have homes to return to, help those who have marriage partners to marry, and organize those who have no homes and no partners to learn skills and engage in production, and confiscate brothel property for the purpose of helping prostitutes.
    This is an important measure concerning women's liberation and national health, and all sectors of the city should unanimously assist the government in carrying it out.
