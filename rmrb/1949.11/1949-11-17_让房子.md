　　Giving Up the House
    Ke Rang
    It started raining at two o'clock that afternoon, and it didn't stop until dark. The dirt streets of Chen Village (near Xing County, Shanxi Province) were full of mud and water, not to mention the paths outside the village.

    The village wasn't big to begin with, and now two battalions had moved in, occupying all the houses designated for the station. Two more platoons were squeezed into the station's main office. Several ropes were tied under the eaves, and wet clothes, trousers, and hats that couldn't be worn were hung on them. Some of the soldiers were sitting, some lying down, but all were holding their guns. The snoring was deafening.

    The station chief had to move to the south room where grain was stored to work.

    At this time, a team of rural work personnel arrived, more than thirty people, their clothes as wet as if they had fallen into the river and just climbed out, shivering with cold. The team leader negotiated with the station chief for housing. The station chief, with a very embarrassed expression, explained to him: "There aren't many houses to begin with, and today two more battalions have arrived, filling up the offices. Please walk another fifteen *li*; there are houses over there." The team leader also said unnaturally: "We were caught in the rain halfway here. There are no villages along the way, and we've been rained on until now. Walking another fifteen *li* will be too much for the comrades, and besides, we have female comrades among us. Can we find two rooms to make do? We can all squeeze together."

    Asking the station chief to find a house was impossible without pulling people out of their homes, but that was out of the question.

    If the work team comrades were asked to walk another fifteen *li*, the comrades would not be able to bear it, and some might get sick, which would affect the work.

    The battalion commander heard the conversation and came to see what was happening. The station chief explained the difficulties on both sides. The battalion commander thought for a moment and then asked the team leader: "How many people are there? Would two large rooms be enough?" The team leader said inexplicably: "More than thirty." The battalion commander went back, and after a while, came back with the political instructor and said to the work team comrades: "You have walked all day today and been rained on for half the day. Besides, your bodies are not as strong as our soldiers, and you are not used to marching. So we have vacated two rooms for you to live in. It doesn't matter if we walk another fifteen *li*." The work team comrades were very moved and said modestly: "No need, we can find a way ourselves, you are also very tired." The battalion commander replied with a smile: "Don't be polite, we are all revolutionary comrades, you go with the political instructor to see the house."

    The work team leader insisted that the soldiers not vacate the house, but the battalion commander insisted on giving up the house. After a long period of mutual concession, the battalion commander finally decided to give up the house.

    When looking at the house, the work team comrades said very apologetically to the soldiers who were vacating the house: "We are very sorry." The soldiers did not seem dissatisfied at all, and said with a smile: "It doesn't matter, we are all comrades, it's all the same who lives here. Besides, we are all from peasant families, in good health; we are used to marching in the rain, it doesn't matter to walk these few *li* more."

　　让房子
    克让
    那天下午两点钟就开始下大雨，一直到天黑还没有停。陈庄（山西兴县附近）的土街上满是泥水，村外的小路上更不用说了。
    村子本来就不大，这天又住下两个营，把兵站号的房子都占满了。还有两个排就挤在兵站的大办公室里，房檐下拴了好几根绳子，上面搭着湿的不能穿的衣服、裤子、帽子等。战士们在屋里有的坐着的躺着的，但都是抱着枪。鼾声响成一片。
    站长只得搬到南间放粮的屋里去办公。
    这时候来了一队下乡工作人员，有三十多个人，衣服都湿得象掉在河里刚爬上来的一样，冷的直打战。队长向站长交涉房子住，站长脸上带着很难为情的表情向他解释道：“本是房子就不多，况且今天又来了两个营，把办公室都住满了。请你们再走十五里吧，那边有房子。”队长也很不自然的说：“从半路上就赶上了雨。路上没有村子，一直淋到现在，再走十五里，同志们是受不住的，再说我们中间还有女同志，能不能将就找两间房子，我们大家挤一下。”
    叫站长找房子，除非把老百姓从屋里拉出来，但那是不行的。
    如果要工作队同志再走十五里，同志们是受不了的，病倒几个，也影响工作。
    营长听见了这里的谈话声，便走来看发生了什么问题。站长把两方面的困难都说了一下。营长想了一下，便问队长：“你们有多少人，两大间房子够不够住？”队长莫明其妙的说：“三十几个。”营长回去了，一会儿，和教导员一同来了，向工作队的同志们说：“你们今天走了一天路，又淋了半天雨。并且你们的身体不象我们战士们那样好，也不习惯行军。所以我们腾出了两间房子给你们住，我们再走十五里不要紧。”工作队的同志非常感动，便谦虚的说：“不用了，我们自己可以想法子，你们也很累。”营长笑着回答：“不用客气，咱们都是革命同志，你们跟教导员去看房子吧。”
    工作队队长坚持不要战士们腾房子，但营长一定要让房子。双方谦让了好久，终于营长还是决定让出房子来。
    在看房子的时候，工作队同志看见正在腾房子的战士，非常抱歉的说：“太对不起你们了。”战士们毫没有不满的样子，笑着说：“不要紧，都是同志，谁住不是一样，再说我们都是庄稼汉出身，身体好；雨里行军也习惯了，再走这几里路没关系。”
