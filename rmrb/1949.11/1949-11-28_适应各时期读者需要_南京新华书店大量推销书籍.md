Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 25th. The Nanjing branch of Xinhua Bookstore promotes a large number of books in accordance with the needs of the political situation in various periods. In the five months since its establishment, the branch has sold more than 2,000 kinds of books (excluding magazines and textbooks), totaling more than 2 million copies. At the beginning of the liberation, books on the theories and policies of the Communist Party sold the most. For example, Chairman Mao's famous book "On New Democracy" sold 120,000 copies. After the masses' ideological awareness gradually improved, they further demanded to understand general social science knowledge and theoretical knowledge. Therefore, the branch reprinted various introductory books on studying social sciences. For example, "History of Social Development" was reprinted 34 times, totaling 170,000 copies. Recently, the branch has also wholesaled a large number of books in line with internationalist propaganda. Because it has kept pace with the political requirements of various periods and met the needs of readers in a timely manner, the branch's business has gradually developed and achieved considerable results. Now, more than 2,000 people come to the store every day to buy books or read. More than 1,000 households mail orders from afar every month. There are also more than 60 private bookstores united around the branch.

　　适应各时期读者需要
  　南京新华书店大量推销书籍
    【新华社南京二十五日电】新华书店南京分店配合各时期政治形势的需要，推销大量书籍。该分店创设五个月来，卖出书籍二千多种（杂志和教科书不包括在内），共计二百多万册。初解放时，有关共产党的理论和政策书籍销得最多，仅毛主席的名著“新民主主义论”就卖出了十二万册。群众思想觉悟逐步提高后，进一步要求了解一般社会科学知识和理论知识，于是该分店又翻印了有关学习社会科学的各种入门书籍，如“社会发展史”就翻印了三十四次，数达十七万册。最近该分店又批发了大批配合国际主义宣传的书籍。由于及时配合了各个时期的政治要求，满足了读者需要，该分店业务日渐发展并获得相当成绩。现在每天来该店买书或阅览的，达两千人以上。远地邮购的每月达一千多户。团结在该分店周围的各私营书店，也有六十多家。
