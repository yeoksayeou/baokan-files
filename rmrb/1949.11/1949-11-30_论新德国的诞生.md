　　On the Birth of New Germany (Continued)
　　Huang Caoliang
　　The establishment of the German Democratic Republic has completely shattered the American imperialists' dream of annexing East Germany and has also fundamentally shaken the American imperialists' rule in West Germany. The American imperialists' plan to transform Germany into a war base has suffered a fatal blow.
　　The establishment of the German Democratic Republic shows that the German people's level of awareness has been unprecedentedly raised, and their organizational power has been greatly strengthened. From being the enemy of the world's people to becoming a reliable friend today, from being the initiator of European wars of aggression to becoming the defender of European peace, this is a new era in German history. This improvement in the German people's awareness and organization has gradually developed over the four years since the surrender of Nazi Germany. In this process, the Soviet Union's resolute implementation of the Potsdam Agreement regarding the thorough elimination of German militarism and the democratization of Germany has been of decisive significance. At the beginning of the surrender of Nazi Germany, due to the influence of long-term fascist militarist education, a considerable part of the German people still had more or less blind revenge emotions, which even caused difficulties for the unity of the workers' movement at that time. From the beginning, the Soviet occupation authorities sincerely supported and helped the German people establish a democratic life, thoroughly eliminated the Nazis, eradicated militarism, implemented land reforms and the nationalization of major enterprises for the benefit of the German people, granted the German people genuine democratic rights, and helped the German people restore and develop a peaceful economy, so that the German people's lives have been significantly improved. At the same time, the Soviet Union has resolutely supported Germany becoming a unified, democratic, and peaceful country in successive international conferences. All these measures have gradually awakened the German people and gradually united them. The German people have recognized the Soviet Union's friendly and peaceful policy from their personal experiences, and they have also recognized the enslavement policies of the United States and other imperialists. The German people have recognized in their personal experiences who their friends are, who their enemies are, and what is the only way out for the German people. In this way, the German people's movement for national unity, independence, peace, and democracy has developed day by day.
　　When the United States, Britain, and France decided to sabotage the foreign ministers' conference and colluded to secretly discuss the establishment of a West German government at the London Foreign Ministers' Conference in November 1947, the German people, under the leadership of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, launched a vigorous and massive resistance movement. The first German People's Congress for German Unity and Just Peace was inaugurated on December 6 on this basis. In addition to the 1,551 representatives from the Soviet occupation zone, 664 representatives from all walks of life in the western occupation zones also participated in the meeting. The meeting unanimously demanded the banning of war-mongers, the establishment of a democratic central government, and the conclusion of a just peace treaty. After the convening of this congress, which united the entire German people to fight for peace and democratic unity, the People's Congress gained a high reputation and enthusiastic response among the broad masses of the German people. Even in Bavaria and Stuttgart in the US occupation zone and in many places in the British and French occupation zones, "Committees for German Unity" were established one after another. In order to strengthen the increasingly developing movement for democratic unity and peace, the Standing Committee elected by the First German People's Congress decided to expand its own organization in March 1948 and rename it the People's Committee. In order to respond with resolute actions to the US, British, and French London Conference's conspiracy to finalize the dismemberment of Germany, the Second German People's Congress, which was held on March 17, 1948, decided to launch a petition signature movement throughout Germany demanding German democratic unity. The signature movement, which began on May 13 and ended on June 13, became a grand demonstration by the broad masses of the German people against the imperialists who were pursuing a policy of division. Despite the various obstacles and sabotage implemented by the authorities in the western occupation zones, a total of 13,124,000 people still signed the petition, accounting for one-third of the more than 40 million eligible voters in Germany. In the province of North Rhine-Westphalia in the British occupation zone, 750,000 people participated in the signature campaign. This signature fully demonstrated the strong hope and willingness of the broad masses of the German people, regardless of East and West Germany, to unanimously demand democratic unity and peace, and oppose division and war. Since the closing of the Third German People's Congress on May 30, the people's movement has been even higher. Rallies were held everywhere throughout the country, and various democratic parties and people's organizations continuously issued declarations and resolutions opposing the disastrous "Bonn Constitution" and separate government. The call for the immediate establishment of a democratic government for all of Germany resounded throughout Germany. A German Democratic Republic and its provisional government that conformed to the will of the people were born in this situation.
　　The establishment of the German Democratic Republic not only proves that the German people do not want a militarist, aggressive old Germany, but are willing and strive for a peace-loving, independent, and unified new Germany, but also proves that the German people have replaced the German monopoly capitalists as the masters of Germany, thus laying the foundation for a unified, peace-loving new Germany. An old Germany with huge potential, a militarist country that invaded and enslaved Europe and launched two world wars, is hereby declared completely dead! A new, democratic Germany with huge potential, defending European peace and unified, is immortal from now on! With the parallel existence and joint efforts of the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic, which possess the greatest potential, European peace has undoubtedly been guaranteed. This marks a fundamental shift in European history. Therefore, the establishment of the German Democratic Republic and its provisional government, as pointed out by Chairman Mao, the great leader of the Chinese people, in his congratulatory message on October 16: "This is a decisive defeat for the imperialist front headed by the reactionary American government in its criminal policy of splitting Germany and restoring Germany as a reactionary state and war base in the period after the Second World War, and a great victory for the world democratic peace camp headed by the Soviet Union."
　　Of course, in the process of continuing to develop into a completely unified, peaceful, democratic, and independent new Germany, the German Democratic Republic still has a long and arduous struggle ahead, because so far only one-third of the liberated territory of Germany has been liberated, and two-thirds of the land is still divided by the United States and other imperialists. But the historical facts of the past four years have proved that the arrogant attempt of the United States and other imperialists to repeat the history after the First World War has suffered a decisive defeat and will continue to suffer a complete defeat. Because the history of modern Germany is not written by a small group of dying and mad imperialists and their agents, but by the German people who are supported by the righteous people of the world. The unprecedentedly awakened and unprecedentedly united people are fully capable of overthrowing the rule of any imperialists and their running dogs and liberating the entire territory. The Chinese people have proved that they can do this, and the German people will certainly prove that they can do this. The German people have already written the history of the establishment of the German Democratic Republic, and they will certainly write the history of the birth of a completely unified, peaceful, and democratic new Germany.

　　论新德国的诞生（续完）
    黄操良
    德意志民主共和国的成立，彻底粉碎了美帝国主义吞并东德的迷梦，同时也从根底上动摇了美帝国主义在西德的统治。美帝国主义变德国为战争基地的计划至此遭到了致命的打击。
    德意志民主共和国的成立，表明了德国人民的觉悟程度已经空前提高，它们的组织力已大大加强。从世界人民的敌人变成了今天的可靠的朋友，从欧洲侵略战争的发动者变成了欧洲和平的保卫者，这是德国历史的新纪元。德国人民的这种觉悟性和组织性的提高，是纳粹德国投降后四年多以来逐步发展起来的。在这中间，苏联坚决执行波茨坦协定中关于彻底肃清德国军国主义和使德国民主化，有着决定的意义。在纳粹德国投降之初，由于长期法西斯军国主义教育的影响，在德国相当一部分人民中，还或多或少存在着盲目的复仇情绪，这甚至使当时工人运动的统一也遭受着困难。苏联占领当局一开始就真诚地支持和帮助德国人民建立民主生活，彻底肃清了纳粹，根除了军国主义，实行为德国人民造福的土地改革和主要企业的国有化，给予了德国人民以真正的民主权利，帮助德国人民恢复和发展和平经济，使德国人民的生活得到显著的改善。同时，苏联在历次国际会议中曾坚决支持德国成为统一、民主与和平的国家。这一切措施，使德国人民逐渐觉醒，逐渐团结起来。德国人民从切身体验中认识了苏联的友好和平政策，也认识了美国等帝国主义的奴役政策。德国人民在切身体验中认识了谁是他们的朋友，谁是他们的敌人，什么是德国人民的唯一出路。这样，德国人民要求国家的统一、独立、和平与民主的运动，便一天天地发展起来。
    当一九四七年十一月间，美英法三国在伦敦外长会议上决意破坏会议并勾结密商建立西德政府问题时，德国人民在德国统一社会党领导下，蓬勃地开展了巨大的反抗运动。争取德国统一与正义和平的首次德国人民代表大会，就在这一基础上于十二月六日揭幕。参加这一会议的，除了苏占区的一五五一名代表外，还有西部占领区各阶层人民的代表六六四人。会上一致要求取缔战争贩子、建立民主的中央政府和缔结公正的和约。这一团结全德人民为和平与民主统一而斗争的代表大会召开以后，人民代表大会在德国广大人民中获得了很高的威望和热烈的响应，甚至美占区的巴伐利亚、斯图加特及英法占领区的许多地方，都纷纷成立了“争取德国统一委员会”。为了加强对日益发展的要求民主统一与和平的运动，由首次德国人民代表大会所选出的常委会，决定于一九四八年三月将自身机构扩大，并改名为人民委员会。为了以坚决的行动回答美英法伦敦会议正在策谋的最后完成肢解德国的阴谋，于一九四八年三月十七日召开的第二届德国人民代表大会，决定在全德发起要求德国民主统一的请愿签名运动。从五月十三日开始到六月十三日结束的签名运动，变成了德国广大人民向实行分裂政策的帝国主义者的大示威。尽管西占区当局实行了种种阻碍和破坏，但在请愿书上签名的，仍一共有一千三百十二万四千人，占全德四千余万合格选民的三分之一。在英占区北莱茵——威斯特利亚一省，参加签名的即有七十五万人。这一签名充分地表现了德国广大人民，不分东德和西德，一致要求民主统一与和平、反对分裂与战争的强烈的希望和意愿。从五月三十日第三届德国人民代表大会闭幕以后，人民运动是更加高涨了。全国各地到处举行集会，各民主党派各人民团体不断发表宣言和决议，反对灾难性的“波恩宪法”和分立政府，要求立即成立全德民主政府的呼声，震响了全德。一个符合民意的德意志民主共和国及其临时政府，就在这一形势下诞生了。
    德意志民主共和国的建立，不仅证明德国人民不愿要一个军国主义的侵略的旧德国，而愿意并力争一个爱好和平、独立、统一的新德国，而且证明德国人民大众已在代替德国独占资本家成为德国的主人，因而奠定了一个统一的爱好和平的新德国的基础。一个拥有巨大潜力的、侵略与奴役欧洲并发动两次世界大战的军国主义的旧德国，从此宣告完全死亡！一个拥有巨大潜力的、保卫欧洲和平的统一的民主新德国，从此永生了！有了拥有最大潜力的苏联和德意志民主共和国的并肩存在和共同努力，无疑已使欧洲的和平获得了保证。这就标志着欧洲历史的根本转变。因此，德意志民主共和国及其临时政府的成立，正如中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席在十月十六日的贺电中所指出的：“这是以美国反动政府为首的帝国主义阵线在第二次世界大战以后时期分裂德国并恢复德国成为反动国家和战争基地的罪恶政策之决定性的失败，是以苏联为首的世界民主和平阵营的伟大胜利。”
    当然，德意志民主共和国在它继续发展成为完全统一的和平、民主、独立的新德国的进程中，还有一段艰苦斗争的道路，因为至今德国已解放的领土还仅三分之一，三分之二的土地还依旧被美国等帝国主义所分割。但是四年余来的历史事实证明：美国等帝国主义打算重复第一次大战以后的历史的狂妄企图，已经遭受了决定性的失败，而且将继续遭受完全的失败。因为写着现代德国历史的，决不是一小撮因濒于死亡而发疯的帝国主义者及其代理人，而是得到全世界正义人民支持的德国人民。空前觉悟空前团结的人民，完全有力量推翻任何帝国主义及其走狗的统治，解放全部国境，中国人民已证明能够这样做，德国人民也必定将证明能够这样做。德国人民已经写了德意志民主共和国成立的历史，而且一定将写出完全统一的和平民主新德国诞生的历史。
