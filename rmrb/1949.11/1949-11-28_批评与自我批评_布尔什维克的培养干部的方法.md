Criticism and Self-Criticism—The Bolshevik Method of Training Cadres
By Γ·Kalinin, translated by Wang Ziye

As early as when Bolshevism was just emerging, Lenin wrote, “Self-criticism is unconditionally necessary for any living and dynamic party.” As defined by Stalin, self-criticism "is an indispensable and constantly effective weapon in the arsenal of Bolshevism, inseparably linked with the very nature of Bolshevism, with its revolutionary spirit." The All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) is a party of innovators; it cannot tolerate adherence to convention and stagnation, and it bravely and tirelessly opens up new paths leading to the future. As the leading and guiding force of Soviet society, the Bolshevik Party is guiding the people of our country towards the complete victory of Communism. In honest and revolutionary self-criticism, in the sincere exposure and correction of shortcomings, the Party has discovered an important method of promoting our progress.

In order to realize the great task of building Communism, all Soviet people are required to wage an unyielding struggle to consolidate the strength of our motherland, to fully develop industry, agriculture, and animal husbandry, and to create an abundance of daily necessities. If the socialist consciousness and initiative of the broad masses of the people, educated by the Party in the spirit of Soviet patriotism, are not further enhanced, and if an irreconcilable struggle is not waged against the remnants of capitalism in people's minds, then there can be no talk of transitioning to Communism. An indispensable condition for solving these tasks is the broadest development of criticism and self-criticism, which are the driving force of Soviet society. Only through criticism and self-criticism can the old and outdated be smoothly overcome, and the new, progressive, and communist be affirmed. Comrade Stalin taught: "The struggle between the old and the new, the struggle between the dying and the nascent, is the foundation of our development. If we do not, in the spirit of a Bolshevik, honestly and frankly point out and expose the shortcomings and errors in our work, then we are cutting off our own path forward. However, we want to move forward. Precisely because we want to move forward, we must regard honest and revolutionary self-criticism as one of our most important tasks. Without this, there can be no progress. Without this, there can be no development." ("Collected Works," Vol. 10, p. 331).

Criticism and self-criticism play a huge role in the cultivation of active builders of communist society, and in the training of cadres in all departments of Bolshevik work. The widespread use of criticism and self-criticism has enabled the Bolshevik Party to train countless working cadres who are capable of completing the tasks facing the Party and the state, unafraid of difficulties, willing to struggle with difficulties, and able to overcome them. Under the leadership of the Lenin-Stalin Party, our cadres victoriously completed the pre-war Stalin Five-Year Plans and gloriously withstood the severe tests of the Great Patriotic War. The activities of Bolshevik cadres have in many ways determined the smooth progress of the post-war Five-Year Plan.

Given the enormous role that Bolshevik cadres play in the life of our country, the Party is constantly concerned with how to arm them with the theory of Marxism-Leninism and how to cultivate Lenin-Stalinist political activists. Throughout its history, the Party has consistently used Bolshevik criticism and self-criticism as a tried and tested weapon to train cadres. Cadres have been educated from their own mistakes with the help of criticism and self-criticism, which Comrade Stalin called the soul of the Bolshevik method of training cadres. Stalin taught: "The slogan of self-criticism should not be regarded as something temporary and fleeting. Self-criticism is an extraordinary method, a Bolshevik method of educating the Party's cadres and the working class in general in the spirit of revolutionary development." ("Collected Works," Vol. 11, p. 127).

The great leaders of the Bolshevik Party, Lenin and Stalin, taught that honestly exposing errors, studying the root causes of errors, and taking the necessary measures to correct errors are the most important methods for correctly educating and training Party cadres, and correctly educating and training the working class and the working masses.

In correcting the errors committed by certain Party organizations and their leaders, the Bolshevik Party not only educated the Party's cadres but also educated the broadest strata of non-Party activists. For example, in 1930, the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) and Comrade Stalin exposed serious distortions of the Party's line in the construction of collective farms. The essence of this distortion lay in the fact that some staff members, dizzy with the astonishing speed of the collectivization of agricultural economy, simply adopted administrative orders, violated the Lenin-Stalin principle of voluntary participation of peasants in collective farms, did not do much explanation work among the peasants, neglected the basic link of the collective farm movement - agricultural labor associations, and attempted to surpass it to reach agricultural communes.

As is well known, the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), under the leadership of Comrade Stalin, took measures against the "leftist" saboteurs in the construction of collective farms, demanding that the crude administrators bear strict Party responsibility. In Comrade Stalin's essays "Dizzy with Success" and "Reply to Collective Farm Comrades," and in the decision of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) "On the Struggle Against Distortions of the Party Line in the Collective Farm Movement" (promulgated on March 15, 1930), on the one hand, a profound Marxist analysis was made of the essence and causes of the errors committed by the "leftist" saboteurs in the construction of collective farms, and on the other hand, a clear program was made for overcoming these errors and raising the collective farm movement to a new and higher stage.

Thanks to the timely countermeasures, our Party was able to correct the errors committed in the implementation of comprehensive collectivization in various places relatively quickly, and to turn our cadres to the correct Lenin-Stalin road of collective farm construction. The victory of the matter was largely determined by the fact that our Party had launched a broad and relentless criticism of the criminals who sabotaged the Party's policy in the collective farm movement. Not only the whole Party participated in correcting the errors, but also the broadest strata of non-Party activists—workers, collective farmers, poor peasants, middle peasants, and representatives of the laboring intellectuals. Therefore, the tenacious and resolute struggle against the distortion of the Party's line in the construction of collective farms was a school for educating countless Party cadres and Soviet state cadres, and was their fighting training in practical work.

Comrade Stalin fully assessed the political significance and educational significance of our Party's struggle to correct the errors and excesses committed by local staff members during the period of comprehensive collectivization. At the plenary session of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in February-March 1937, he said: "If we had not exposed the errors of 1930 and used these errors to educate our collective farm Bolshevik cadres, we would have destroyed them without fail... Whoever wants to cherish the self-esteem of our cadres by covering up their errors will bury our cadres and their self-esteem, because by covering up their errors, he makes it easier for new, perhaps more serious errors to be repeated, which, it should be seen, will lead the cadres to a mess in damaging their 'self-esteem' and 'tranquility.'"

The resolution of the Council of Ministers of the USSR and the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) on September 19, 1946, "On Measures to Overcome the Sabotage of the Regulations on Agricultural Labor Associations in Collective Farms," is an example of educating cadres with their own errors. In this resolution, sharp criticism was made of the major errors committed by some Party and Soviet cadres in leading the construction of collective farms. The Council of Ministers of the USSR and the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) exposed the popular violations of the collective farm regulations, admitted that they were very dangerous to the entire socialist construction, denounced them as anti-collective farm and anti-national, and ordered the leaders of the Party and Soviet organizations of the republic, the border area, and the locality to take regular measures to eliminate the sabotage of agricultural labor associations. Only by implementing criticism and self-criticism could the errors in the construction of collective farms be corrected in a short period of time, and the Party and Soviet cadres in the agricultural economy be educated thereby.

In order to eliminate the errors committed by individual staff members on the ideological front, the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) issued the famous decisions on the magazines "Zvezda" and "Leningrad," the decision on the theatrical program and its improvement methods, the decision on the film "The Great Life," and the decision on Muradeli's opera "The Great Friendship." These decisions exposed and relentlessly criticized the shortcomings and errors in the field of literature and art, denounced small sectarian groups who sacrificed the interests of the Soviet state and the people for the interests of private friends, and struggled against the intrusion of bourgeois consciousness into Soviet literature and art. The Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) instructed the ways to correct the errors, called on all literary and artistic staff to proceed from the policies of the Bolshevik Party and the Soviet state in their creative activities (because policy is the basis of life of the Soviet system), and launched principled, Bolshevik self-criticism in the ranks of literature and art.

The discussion on Alexandrov's work "History of Western European Philosophy" held in accordance with the instructions of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) is a brilliant example of Bolshevik criticism and self-criticism. In his speech at the discussion, Comrade Zhdanov sharply criticized the concept of objectivism in Alexandrov's works, pointing out the danger of this concept, which inevitably leads to bowing down to bourgeois culture. Zhdanov pointed out that the lack of expanded criticism and self-criticism is the reason for the existing undesirable situation on the philosophical front. Philosophical activities are occupied by small groups of philosophers. Alexandrov overestimated his own strength and did not rely on the extensive collective, experience and knowledge of philosophers, but relied on a small group of people close to him and genius worshippers. The Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) resolutely denounced this practice that hinders the elimination of shortcomings on the philosophical front, and called on philosophical cadres to have a militant, Bolshevik Party spirit, to take an offensive struggle against hostile, bourgeois ideologies, to seriously make theoretical summaries of the practical aspects of communist construction, and to launch criticism and self-criticism on the philosophical front.

The Bolshevik methods of criticism and self-criticism were also brilliantly applied to the development of advanced Michurin biology and its use to achieve the goal of improving socialism. Bolshevik criticism and self-criticism also played a huge role in crushing the reactionary Weismann-Morgan theory, which was popular among some biologists in our country. Criticism and self-criticism enabled the Michurin school to win victory and cleared the way for their beneficial activities.

Bolshevik criticism and self-criticism have also played a huge role in educating cadres of Soviet intellectuals in the spirit of Soviet patriotism, love for the people, and hatred for the enemy. The exposure of anti-patriotic groups of drama critics and other individual degenerates and small groups on the ideological front who promoted cosmopolitan ideas has brought beneficial results and further strengthened the militant, patriotic spirit of Soviet intellectuals.

Bolshevik criticism proceeds from the interests of the people, from the policies of the Party and the Soviet state. This criticism is dedicated to the improvement of the cause, the correction of errors, and the education of cadres.

The Party often denounces those who violate the interests of the Party and the state and refuse to expose but prefer to cover up or conceal their own or others' errors. Comrade Stalin said at the 15th Congress of the Party: "For example, Ivan Ivanovich, a leading member of an organization, committed the most foolish error and messed things up. But Ivan Fedorovich is unwilling to criticize him, expose his error, and correct his error. The reason for his unwillingness is that he does not want to 'make enemies' with him. What does it matter if he makes a mistake and messes things up! Who among us does not make mistakes? Today I—Ivan Fedorovich forgive him, and he—Ivan Ivanovich will forgive me tomorrow. Because where can he guarantee that he himself will not make mistakes? Wouldn't it be good to be polite and peaceful with each other! Some people say, will forgiving errors mess up our great cause? It doesn't matter, we can always get by.

Comrades, this is the universal argument of some of our responsible staff members.

But what does this mean? If we Bolsheviks are to criticize the whole world, and in Marx's words, we are going to turn the world upside down, if we give up self-criticism for the sake of the peace of mind of some comrades, then there will be no result other than burying our great cause. Is this not clear?"

A high degree of principle, evaluating the activities of cadres, the political attitude towards their errors and their shortcomings—these are the most important characteristics of Bolshevik criticism and self-criticism.

Bolshevik criticism is open, brave, and direct criticism that is unconcerned with face-saving. Openly condemning errors and shortcomings can help expose their essence, root causes, and find ways to eliminate them. The Party denounces those who are afraid of "washing dirty linen in public" and give up openly criticizing shortcomings. Comrade Stalin said at the 15th Congress of the Party: "As for washing dirty linen in public, that is nonsense, comrades. We have never been afraid and will not be afraid in the future to openly criticize ourselves and our errors in front of the whole Party. The strength of the Bolsheviks lies especially in the fact that they are not afraid of criticism and draw the ability to move forward further from criticizing their shortcomings."

The characteristics of Bolshevik criticism and self-criticism are its specificity and relevance. Criticism should not be "general" criticism, which is limited to acknowledging errors, but cannot find its root causes, cannot find its perpetrators, and cannot point out ways to eliminate errors and shortcomings in work. The task of criticism is to point out ways to eliminate the errors that have occurred and to prevent new errors from being repeated. When ways to eliminate shortcomings and errors are pointed out, and when efforts are made to eliminate errors and shortcomings, criticism and self-criticism lead to the improvement of the cause, help cadres to progress, and raise them to a new and higher stage.

The view that people are inherently incapable of correcting shortcomings is completely wrong. This is a metaphysical attitude towards cadres; it hinders their development, their education, and it does not intend to distinguish the valuable things that are inherent in the cadres themselves and must be developed and supported with all their strength. People, cadres, can victoriously overcome their shortcomings. The task of criticism and self-criticism is to help cadres get rid of weaknesses and errors, and to use all methods to support and develop everything progressive and communist in people. Criticism and self-criticism are a reliable guarantee against clinging to the old ways, conservatism, and stagnation. It encourages people to work in new ways, encourages learning, broadens their horizons, bravely overcomes difficulties, and moves forward.

Bolshevik criticism is always well-founded criticism, which is based on the solid foundation of facts that have been thoroughly checked. Unfounded criticism and uncomradely criticism will have no other result than to bring harm to the cause of educating cadres.

We do not need all kinds of criticism and self-criticism, but only the kind of criticism and self-criticism that proceeds from the policies of the Bolshevik Party and the Soviet state, which can help the Party educate the masses in the communist spirit, improve the ideological and cultural level of cadres, increase their strength, and lead them forward.

Our Party, Comrade Stalin taught, is not all criticism that is Bolshevik and Soviet. There was a time when various anti-Party and anti-Soviet people opposed each other under the guise of "criticism." As everyone knows, for example, the Trotsky opposition criticized some of our large industrial enterprises as unprofitable. The Party also criticized them for this. However, the Party criticized loss-making enterprises in order to improve their work, help them overcome uneconomical, lax discipline, and ultimately strengthen them and make them profitable. However, the opposition demanded the closure of these factories, which was a blow to our industrialization. The "criticism" of the Trotskyites on all other issues also carried this nature: they tried to destroy the Party spirit, disintegrate the Soviet regime, weaken our construction, decompose our economic cadres, and disarm the working class. Comrade Stalin taught: "It is necessary to strictly distinguish this alien, destructive, and anti-Bolshevik 'self-criticism' from our Bolshevik self-criticism, the purpose of which is to cultivate the Party spirit, consolidate the Soviet regime, improve our construction, consolidate our economic cadres, and arm the working class." (Collected Works, Vol. 2, p. 133).

Self-criticism, as developed by our Party, can improve our work, educate and train cadres, and consolidate Party and state discipline.

The Bolshevik Party guarantees all the conditions necessary for developing self-criticism and absorbing the broad masses of workers to participate in the exposure and elimination of shortcomings.

The Party is constantly concerned with the ideological and political training of cadres, and concerned with the communist education of the hard-working people of socialist society. Mastering Marxist-Leninist theory will enhance people's awareness, increase their sense of responsibility for the progress of socialist construction, and generate an irreconcilable attitude towards shortcomings, errors, and everything that hinders our society's movement towards communism. Theory can understand the profound meaning and internal connections of events, and studying theory can timely discover shortcomings and errors, expose their root causes, and quickly find ways to eliminate shortcomings and errors.

Studying the history of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), and studying the biographies of the leaders of the Party and the people—Lenin and Stalin—is especially important. Our cadres learn from Lenin and Stalin to evaluate people's activities from the Party's principled standpoint, and to take an irreconcilable attitude towards errors and shortcomings.

Implementing democracy in all social organizations—Party, Youth League, Soviet, trade union organizations—is the most important condition for launching criticism and self-criticism. Without democracy, there is no Bolshevik criticism and self-criticism.

Inner-Party democracy is an example of democracy for all organizations. Inner-Party democracy guarantees the active participation of Communist Party members in the life of the Party; the Party masses can freely and conscientiously discuss the issues of the Party's policies and practical work, resolve these issues, and achieve the victorious implementation of the Party's instructions. At Party meetings, every Communist Party member can exercise the rights granted to him by the Party Constitution and criticize any staff member of the Party. Inner-Party democracy is an indispensable condition for launching criticism and self-criticism. The Constitution of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) says: "Only on the basis of inner-Party democracy can Bolshevik self-criticism be launched..."

Regularly holding plenary sessions of Party committees, Party congresses, and Party activist meetings is of great significance for launching Bolshevik criticism and self-criticism. The resolution of the plenary session of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in February and March 1937 wrote: "...Plenary sessions of local Party committees and municipal Party committees, Party congresses, and meetings of municipal activists are usually one of the best places to launch criticism of the shortcomings of our work and the Party's leaders, and to conduct self-criticism, where the leaders of Party organizations report their work to the lower-level Party staff and the Party masses, and where every Party staff member and every Party member has the right to freely criticize and conscientiously criticize, and has the right to warn against the shortcomings of work." The Constitution of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) stipulates that Party activist meetings should be held regularly to discuss important resolutions of the Party and the government, and points out: "Activists should be convened, not to decorate the facade and solemnly agree to these resolutions, but to effectively discuss them."

Implementing the principle of inner-Party democracy can place leading cadres under the supervision of Party organizations, help cadres correct errors in their work, and enrich the experience of the Party masses. Inner-Party democracy makes it possible to fully utilize the powerful weapon of criticism and self-criticism to fight against individual Communist Party members' arrogance, bureaucracy, flattery, petty-bourgeois sentimentality, and other non-Bolshevik characteristics, promote the consolidation of the relationship between leaders and the led, and guide all Party and state work to become increasingly better. Wherever inner-Party democracy is not followed, Party meetings and activist meetings, Party committees, are rarely convened and are held at a low ideological and political level, there is no criticism and self-criticism, there cadres are not educated correctly, there leaders begin to lose a sense of responsibility to the masses, and there is created in them a belief that their actions are correct and flawless, which results in a non-Party attitude towards self-criticism, trying to suppress it or restrict it.

Expanding democracy within all mass organizations is a necessary condition for developing criticism and self-criticism from below, and a necessary condition for absorbing the broad masses of the people to participate in criticism and self-criticism. Comrade Stalin said: "Without this condition, self-criticism is equal to zero, empty talk, and rhetoric."

Following the Bolshevik principle of promoting cadres according to their political qualities and working abilities is an indispensable condition for developing criticism and self-criticism. If this rule is violated, and some fellow villagers and friends are promoted, regardless of their political qualities and working abilities, the result will be the creation of a leading core in the organization or institution that is not responsible staff members, but a small group of relatives and friends who strive to live in peace, do not "attack" each other, and do not wash dirty linen in public. Promoting cadres according to subjective opinions and personal feelings will create a favorable environment for mutual boasting and encouraging flattery, and will leave no room for criticism of shortcomings and errors, and for the true Bolshevik education of cadres.

Criticism and self-criticism are closely inseparable from correctly checking the implementation situation. Comrade Stalin gave a classic definition of the role and significance of checking the implementation situation: "Checking the implementation situation well—this is the original searchlight, which helps to find out the situation of the work of the organ at any time, and expose the original form of the gentlemanly bureaucracy and the paperworkist. It can be said with certainty that nine out of ten of our shortcomings and loopholes are due to the failure to correctly organize the work of checking the implementation situation. There is no doubt that if there is such a check of the implementation situation, then the shortcomings and loopholes can be completely prevented in advance." ("Questions of Leninism," 11th edition, p. 481).

It is very important to combine the top-down inspection of the implementation situation with the bottom-up inspection, and the method of combining is to absorb the broadest strata of Party and non-Party activists to participate in the inspection of the implementation situation. Forms of mass supervision such as workers' meetings, collective farm meetings, economic activist meetings, and production meetings can promote the broadest development of criticism and self-criticism, expose shortcomings, discover the root causes of shortcomings, and find the best ways to overcome shortcomings. These forms of supervision can become real schools for cadres to educate cadres with the point.

Criticism and self-criticism can only become an effective method of educating cadres when it is not used occasionally, but regularly and systematically. Often, it is only after staff members have committed major errors that they are criticized. The collapse of work, as a rule, occurs gradually, accumulating small errors into major errors, and only when criticism and self-criticism become a regularly effective working method can the collapse of work be prevented in time.

Newspapers play a very important role in launching criticism and self-criticism. Criticism in newspapers, publicizing the shortcomings and errors of a staff member in practical work, is the most effective method of educating cadres. The criticism in newspapers is of particular significance because it absorbs the broad masses of the laboring people to participate in the struggle against errors and shortcomings, and thus becomes a powerful tool for launching criticism and self-criticism from below.

Socialist competition is an outstanding form of criticism and self-criticism. Comrade Stalin said: "Socialist competition is a manifestation of the practical revolutionary self-criticism of the masses, and it relies on the creative initiative of millions of masses." The publication of the competition and the extensive discussion of its results all promote the development of criticism and self-criticism. In addition to revealing achievements, we can determine the causes of shortcomings in the work, expose the specific persons responsible for these shortcomings, and then the group can find a reliable way to move forward further.

Bolshevik cadres should use all methods to promote socialist competition and eliminate everything that hinders the development of practical revolutionary self-criticism and the creative initiative of the masses. At the same time, it is the responsibility of our cadres to constantly study and summarize the new and progressive things produced in socialist competition, and to improve and refine their work on this basis.

The expansion of democracy, the systematic inspection of the implementation situation, and the increase of socialist competition—these are very important conditions for criticism and self-criticism to victoriously assume the role of the Bolshevik method of educating cadres.

The Party educates cadres with the spirit of a correct, Party attitude towards criticism and self-criticism. To treat criticism and self-criticism with the Party's attitude is to first have the courage to openly admit one's mistakes and make everything needed to eliminate them quickly. Comrade Stalin said: "Not concealing one's errors, not avoiding questions about one's errors, as we often do, but sincerely and openly admitting one's errors, sincerely and openly finding the way to correct these errors, sincerely and openly correcting one's errors—this is the responsibility of the Bolsheviks."

However, not everywhere has learned this attitude towards criticism. We still often encounter staff members who are unwilling to listen to the voices of the masses, do not consider the criticism from below, and hinder the development of criticism. Inclined to a peaceful and tranquil life, these staff members avoid any words of criticism in their speeches. This is a non-Party attitude towards criticism. The Party often resolutely denounces those staff members who try to evade self-criticism and overthrow or weaken it. As early as 1928, Comrade Stalin said: "I know that there are still people in the Party ranks who do not like criticism at all, especially self-criticism. I can call these people 'lacquered' communists. They often shout, waving away self-criticism: he said, it's that damn self-criticism again, and it's exposing our shortcomings again. Can't we live in peace? Obviously, these 'lacquered' communists have nothing in common with the spirit of our Party and the spirit of the Bolsheviks." (Collected Works, Vol. 11, p. 28).

The suppressor of self-criticism or those who do not understand the significance of self-criticism usually adopt methods of restriction and suppression under the pretext of maintaining the prestige of the leaders. However, as everyone knows, the prestige of the leaders can only be damaged by their own non-Party attitude towards criticism and self-criticism. If staff members do not admit their mistakes, try to quibble obvious facts, shirk responsibility, and suppress criticism and self-criticism, then they will undoubtedly lose the respect of others, because everyone can see that in front of them is a coward who does not have the courage to admit his mistakes, a bad staff member who is unwilling to correct his shortcomings, and a person with meager, vulgar self-esteem. Conversely, if staff members openly admit their mistakes and resolutely fight to correct them, this can only consolidate their prestige and arouse people's respect for them. Everyone will say: This is a true Bolshevik, a courageous person, a person who can be trusted, because he puts the interests of public affairs above narrow self-esteem.

The Party teaches its cadres to bravely admit their mistakes. Lenin warned more than once that if one insists on small mistakes, it is possible to develop into irreparable big mistakes. There have been many examples in the history of our Party of some people who, because they insisted on their mistakes, ended up completely disengaging themselves from the Party and disengaging themselves from the people.

The Party's attitude towards criticism and self-criticism not only requires admitting mistakes: admitting mistakes should be followed by correcting them, which is the purpose of criticism and self-criticism. However, sometimes we also encounter staff members who are limited to verbally and formally admitting shortcomings, promising to correct them... but in reality, they continue to work as before.

The formal response to criticism hinders an organization from correcting concrete shortcomings in its work, reduces the enthusiasm of the group in fighting against shortcomings, and binds his energy and initiative. The formal, verbal response to criticism is essentially nothing more than a subtle and hidden form of suppressing self-criticism. The Party requires Communist Party members not only to admit mistakes, but also to correct them first and foremost, and to educate cadres in the spirit of true criticism and self-criticism.

The ability to treat criticism and self-criticism with the Party's attitude is not an innate characteristic: it is the result of communist education. To develop the self-criticism ability of staff members is to first teach them to patiently listen to criticism from below. Comrade Stalin taught: "In order to lead, it is necessary to foresee. And foreseeing, comrades, is not easy. It is one thing when one or twenty leading comrades see and notice the shortcomings in us, but the working masses are unwilling or unable to see and notice the shortcomings. There is every chance that the situation will occur, although they do see it, but not everything is noticed. It is another thing when millions of workers together with one or twenty leading comrades see and notice the shortcomings in our work, expose our errors, participate in the general cause of construction, and find ways to improve the cause. Here there is a greater guarantee that accidents will no longer occur, negative phenomena will be noticed in time, and countermeasures will be taken in time to eliminate these phenomena." (Collected Works, Vol. 11, pp. 35-36).

The criticism from the masses from below is needed, also in order to take care of and implement the enormous construction experience, which is the result of the accumulation of the laboring masses' experience over the years, and its value is no less than the leaders' experience.

The purpose of criticism from the Soviet people is to improve the work of Soviet organs, Party, trade union, and other organizations, and to improve economic and cultural construction. Comrade Stalin said that it is necessary to carefully listen to any criticism from the Soviet people, even if this criticism is not complete and every part is correct, because only under this condition can self-criticism acquire a truly mass character and truly reflect the opinions of the masses.

Educating cadres to treat criticism and self-criticism with the Party's attitude is a necessary condition for forming true Bolshevik cadres. In his report on the magazines "Zvezda" and "Leningrad," Comrade Zhdanov emphasized the great significance of every Bolshevik staff member treating his own cause with a strict self-criticism attitude. He said: "Comrade Stalin has repeatedly pointed out that the most important condition for our development is that every Soviet person must sum up his work every day, check himself without fear, analyze his work, bravely criticize his shortcomings and errors, think deeply about how to make his work achieve better results, and work continuously to improve himself... Whoever is afraid to criticize his own work is a despicable coward and does not deserve the respect of the people."

The Party's attitude towards criticism and self-criticism lies in the need to achieve leadership self-criticism and guide self-criticism. Leading self-criticism does not mean promoting its development in words, but in practice, using all methods to promote its development, constantly applying it in practice, and educating cadres to overcome shortcomings, eliminate errors, and move forward through criticism and self-criticism. More importantly, one must be able to expose the root causes of errors; this can help correctly find ways to overcome them. However, in practice, criticism is often reduced to the verification of the shortcomings of a staff member in his activities, after which he is formally advised to eliminate the shortcomings. Because the root causes of the errors have not been exposed, the staff member continues to work in the old way, and eventually ruins the work.

Leading self-criticism means carefully listening to every criticism, especially the criticism from below, and waging an irreconcilable struggle against all attempts to suppress criticism and self-criticism, treating such attempts as attempts to hinder our progress. Direct suppression of self-criticism is rarely encountered in our era, so it is all the more necessary to fight against the hidden forms of suppressing criticism and self-criticism, which either ignore criticism and self-criticism, or adopt a formal attitude towards criticism and self-criticism, only verbally and emptily promising to correct errors or only treating it as officialese.

The best way to resolve criticism and self-criticism is to make it effective. If the leaders report at Party or workers' meetings what measures have been taken in response to the criticisms made at the previous meeting, if measures are taken immediately in response to the warnings in the newspapers, in response to workers' correspondence and complaints, and if the positive results of the criticism are made public, then staff members will increasingly begin to understand the significance of this brilliant weapon of Bolshevism and adopt it.

In launching self-criticism, the personal example of cadres is of great significance. Leading staff members should point out examples of courageous, frank, and principled self-criticism at all times and places, especially in speeches at Party, workers', and collective farm meetings, and in newspapers, and give examples of how to analyze errors, expose the root causes of shortcomings, and find ways to correct them. The nature of the meeting is often determined by the leaders' speeches: is it conducted in an atmosphere of serious criticism and self-criticism, or is it just for show and to praise achievements.

It is the responsibility of every Party and non-Party Bolshevik to fully contribute to the development of criticism and self-criticism. Here, the role of the Party leader is particularly important, because the Party entrusts him with the important task of developing criticism and self-criticism within the Party organization he leads.

Under the current conditions, when the great task of completing the construction of socialist society and gradually transitioning from socialism to communism is placed before the Soviet people, higher demands cannot but be placed on our cadres. The more irreconcilable they are towards shortcomings, and the more they launch effective criticism and self-criticism (this is a tried and tested method of Bolshevik education of cadres, and an important condition for our progress), the more smoothly they will complete their tasks.

    还在布尔什维主义刚刚产生的时候，列宁就已写道，“自我批评对于任何一个有生气、有活力的政党是无条件地必需的。”按照斯大林下的定义，自我批评“乃是布尔什维主义武库中的不可缺少的、经常有效的武器，是同布尔什维主义底本性、同它底革命精神不可分离地联结着的。”联共（布）乃是革新者底政党；她对墨守成规和固步自封是不能忍受的，她勇敢而不倦地开拓引向将来的新的道路。作为苏维埃社会底领导的和指导的力量，布尔什维克党正引导我国底人民走向共产主义底完全的胜利。在正直的和革命的自我批评中，在缺点底诚恳揭露和纠正中，党发现了推动我们前进的一个重要的方法。
    为了实现建设共产主义这个伟大的任务，就要求一切苏维埃人为巩固我们祖国底力量，为充分发挥工业、农业和畜牧业，为创造丰足的日用品而进行不屈不挠的斗争。假如没有党以苏维埃爱国主义精神所教育的广大人民群众底社会主义意识和积极性之进一步提高，假如不同人们意识中的资本主义残余作不调和的斗争，那未过渡到共产主义是无从谈起的。解决这些任务的不可或缺的条件，就是最广泛地发展批评和自我批评，它们乃是苏维埃社会底动力。唯有靠批评与自我批评才能顺利地克服陈旧的、过时的，而肯定新的、前进的、共产主义的东西。斯大林同志教导说：“旧东西和新东西之间的斗争，垂死者和新生者之间的斗争，这就是我们发展底基础。我们如果不以布尔什维克应有的精神，去诚恳而坦白地指出和揭发我们工作中的缺点和错误，那就等于自断前进的道路。然而，我们是想前进的。正因为我们想前进，我们就应当把正直的和革命的自我批评作为我们极重要的任务之一。非此便不能前进。非此便不能发展。”（“全集”第十卷第三三一页）。

    在共产主义社会积极建设者之培养上，在布尔什维克的一切工作部门干部的培养上，批评与自我批评起了巨大的作用。广泛使用批评与自我批评使布尔什维克党锻炼出无数的工作干部，这些干部有能力完成摆在党和国家面前的任务，不畏困难，会同困难作斗争，并克服它们。在列宁斯大林党的领导之下，我们干部胜利地完成了战前的斯大林五年计划，光荣地坚持过伟大卫国战争年代的严峻的考验。布尔什维克干部底活动在许多方面都决定了施行战后五年计划的顺利的进程。
    鉴于布尔什维克干部在我们国家底生活中起的作用太大了，党随时随刻都关心着如何用马克思列宁主义底理论来武装他们，如何培养列宁斯大林式的政治活动家。党在自己历史底全过程中始终不变地利用布尔什维克的批评与自我批评是付久经考验的武器来训练干部。干部靠批评与自我批评底帮助从自己底错误中受了教育，斯大林同志曾称批评与自我批评是培养干部之布尔什维克方法的灵魂。斯大林教导说：“自我批评底口号不应视作某种一时的、倏忽即逝的东西。自我批评是一种非同寻常的方法，是以革命发展底精神教育党底干部和一般工人阶级的布尔什维克的方法。”（“全集”十一卷一二七页）
    布尔什维克党底伟大领袖列宁和斯大林教导说，诚恳地揭露错误，研究错误发生的根源，采取改正错误底必要的措施，这是正确教育和培养党的干部、正确教育和培养工人阶级和劳动群众之最重要的方法。
    在纠正某些党组织及其领导者所犯的错误时，布尔什维克党不仅教育了党的干部，并且教育了非党积极分子最广泛的阶层。例如一九三○年联共（布）中央和斯大林同志曾揭露了在集体农场的建设中存在着党的路线的严重的曲解。这个曲解的实质，就在于有某些工作人员因被农业经济集体化的惊人速度冲昏了头脑，于是就干脆采用了行政命令的办法，破坏列宁——斯大林的农民自愿参加集体农场的原则，不在农民当中多多进行解释工作，忽视集体农场运动的基本环节——农业劳动组合，而企图超越它达到农业公社。
    人所共知，联共（布）中央在斯大林同志底领导之下，曾采取了反对集体农场建设中的“左倾”破坏者的措施，要求粗暴的行政命令者担负严格的党的责任。在斯大林同志底论文“胜利冲昏头脑”，“给集体农场同志们的答复”内，在联共（布）中央“关于与集体农场运动内党的路线的曲解作斗争”的决定（一九三○年三月十五日公布）中，一方面对集体农场建设中“左倾”破坏者所犯错误底实质与原因作了深刻的马克思主义的分析，同时又作出了克服这些错误和把集体农场运动提高到新的、更高阶段的明确的纲领。
    由于适时地采取了对策，我们底党才得以比较迅速地纠正各地实行全面集体化时所犯的错误，并把我们底干部扭转到正确的、列宁——斯大林的集体农场建设底道路上来。事情底胜利大半决定于我们的党曾对集体农场运动中破坏党的政策的罪犯展开了广泛的和无情的批评。参加纠正错误这件工作的不仅是全党，而且还有非党积极分子的最广泛的阶层——工人、集体农民、贫农、中农和劳动知识分子的代表者。因此，同集体农场建设中的党的路线底曲解进行顽强的和坚决的斗争乃是教育无数的党的干部、苏维埃国家干部底学校，乃是他们在实际工作中的战斗的锻炼。
    斯大林同志对于我们党为了纠正地方工作人员在全面集体化时期所犯的错误与过火所作的斗争底政治重要性和教育意义作了充分的估价，他在一九三七年二—三月的联共（布）中央全会上说：“假如没有揭发一九三○年底错误和没有用这些错误来教育我们集体农场的布尔什维克的干部，我们就会不折不扣地把他们毁了……谁要想借掩盖其错误来顾惜我们干部底自尊，那么就将葬送我们底干部和干部底自尊，因为他掩盖他们底错误便使新的、或许是更严重的错误容易重复，这些错误，应该看到，将引导干部在损害他们底‘自尊’与‘安宁’方面达到一团糟的地步。”
    苏联部长会议和联共（布）中央在一九四六年九月十九日“关于克服破坏集体农场中农业劳动组合规章底措置”底决议乃是用干部自己底错误来教育干部底例子。在这决议中对于部份党的和苏维埃的干部在领导集体农场建设中所犯的大错误作了尖锐的批评。苏联部长会议和联共（布）中央揭发了已经流行的对于集体农场规章的破坏，承认它们对于整个社会主义建设是非常危险的，指斥他们是反集体农场的，是反国家的，并责令共和国底、边疆底和地方底党的和苏维埃组织底领导人采取定期的办法来消灭对农业劳动组合底破坏。只有实行批评和自我批评才能在短期间纠正集体农场建设中底错误，并以此教育农业经济中底党的和苏维埃的干部。
    为了消灭思想意识战线上个别工作人员所犯的错误，联共（布）中央发布了有名的关于“星”和“列宁格勒”杂志底决定，关于剧场上演节目及其改进办法的决定，关于影片“伟大的生活”的决定，关于摩拉杰里底歌剧“伟大的友爱”的决定。这些决定中揭露了和无情批判了文学和艺术领域内底缺点和错误，斥责了小宗派集团，它把苏维埃国家底和人民底利益作了私人朋友利益底牺牲品，而不同资产阶级意识底侵入苏维埃文学和艺术作斗争。联共（布）中央指示了纠正错误底道路，号召一切文学和艺术底工作人员在自己底创作活动中应从布尔什维克党和苏维埃国家底政策出发（因为政策乃是苏维埃制度底生活基础），并且在文学和艺术底队伍中展开原则的、布尔什维克的自我批评。
    遵照联共（布）中央指示举行的对亚历克山得洛夫底著作“西欧哲学史”底讨论，乃是布尔什维克的批评和自我批评底光辉范例。日丹诺夫同志在讨论会底发言中对亚历克山得洛夫著作中的客观主义的概念作了尖锐的批判，指出了这种概念底危险性，它不可避免要走到拜倒于资产阶级的文化之前。日丹诺夫指出，缺乏展开的批评和自我批评乃是哲学战线上既成的不良状况底原因，哲学活动被哲学家底小集团霸占着，亚历克山得洛夫过高估计了自己的力量，不依靠于哲学家底广泛的集体，底经验和知识，而是依靠于他所亲近的同人和天才崇拜者底狭小集团。联共（布）中央坚决地斥责了这个阻碍消灭哲学战线上的缺点底习尚，号召哲学干部要有战斗的、布尔什维克的党性，要向敌对的、资产阶级的意识形态采取进攻的斗争，要对共产主义建设底实际认真作出理论上的总结，要在哲学战线上展开批评与自我批评。
    布尔什维克的批评与自我批评的方法也光辉地采用于发展先进的、米邱林的生物学和利用它来达到提高社会主义的目的。布尔什维克的批评与自我批评在反动的魏斯曼主义——摩尔根主义理论之粉碎上也起了巨大的作用，这种反动的理论曾流行于我国部分生物学家中间，批评与自我批评使米邱林派获得胜利，并为他们底有益的活动扫清了道路。
    布尔什维克的批评与自我批评在以苏维埃爱国主义精神，对于人民底爱和对于敌人底恨，来教育苏维埃知识界干部上面也起了巨大的作用。揭发戏剧批评家底反爱国主义集团和其他思想意识战线上宣传世界主义性质观念的个别蜕化分子和小集团，带来了有益的结果，更加锻炼了苏维埃知识分子底战斗的、爱国主义的精神。
    布尔什维克的批评是从人民底利益出发，从党和苏维埃国家底政策出发的。这种批评是致力于事业底改善、错误底纠正、干部底教育的。
    党常常斥责那些违背党和国家利益，不肯揭发而宁愿掩盖、隐瞒自己或别人错误的人们。斯大林同志在党底十五次代表大会上说：“比如某一组织里的上层领导分子伊凡·伊凡诺维赤犯了最愚蠢的错误，把事情弄糟了。但是伊凡·费多罗维赤不愿批评他，揭发他底错误，纠正他底错误。其所以不愿，是因为不想同他‘结怨’。犯了错误，弄糟了事情，那有什么要紧！我们谁个不犯错误呢？今天我—伊凡·费多罗维赤宽恕了他，他——伊凡·伊凡诺维赤明天就会宽恕我的。因为那里能担保我自己也不会犯错误呢？彼此客客气气，和和平平，岂不是好！有人说，宽恕错误会不会弄糟我们的大事呢？不要紧，总可以过得去的。
    同志们，这就是我们有些负责工作人员的普遍论调。
    但这是什么意思呢？假如说我们布尔什维克是要批评全世界的，用马克思的话来说，我们将要翻天覆地，假如说我们为着某些同志底安宁而放弃自我批评，那除了能葬送我们底伟大事业以外，不会有别的结果，这难道还不明白吗？”
    高度的原则性，评价干部的活动，其错误、其缺点之政治态度，——这就是布尔什维克的批评与自我批评之最重要的特点。
    布尔什维克的批评是公开的、勇敢的、直接的批评，是不顾情面的批评。公开的责斥错误和缺点可以帮助揭发它们底实质、根源和找出消灭它们底方法。党斥责那些害怕“家丑外扬”和放弃公开批评缺点的人们。斯大林同志在党的十五次代表大会上说：“至于说到家丑外扬，这是胡说，同志们。我们从不害怕而且将来也不害怕在全党面前公开地批评自己和自己底错误。布尔什维克底力量特别是在于他不害怕批评并在批评自己底缺点中吸取更向前进底能力。”
    布尔什维克的批评和自我批评底特点是其具体性和有的放矢。批评不应当是“一般的”批评，后者只局限于错误的承认，而不能找出它底根源，不能找出它底犯罪人，不能指出消灭工作中错误和缺点底方法。批评底任务就在指出消灭已发生的错误底方法并预防新的错误重犯。当指出了消灭缺点和错误的方法，当努力消灭错误和缺点时，批评和自我批评便引导到事业底改善，帮助干部进步，提到新的更高的阶段。
    那种认为人们在本性上就不能纠正缺点的观点是十分错误的。这是形而上学的对待干部底态度；它阻滞着他们底发展，他们底教育，它不打算辨别那种为干部本身所具有而必须全力予以发展和支持的有价值的东西。人们、干部能够胜利地克服自己底缺点。批评和自我批评底任务是在于帮助干部解脱弱点、错误，用一切方法来支持和发展人们中的一切前进的、共产主义的东西。批评和自我批评是反对抱残守缺、保守主义、固步自封的可靠的保证，它鼓励人们按照新的方法工作，鼓励学习，扩大自己底眼界，勇敢地克服困难和向前推进。
    布尔什维克的批评经常是有根据的批评，这种批评是建立在经过详细检查的事实底坚固基础之上。无根据的批评、非同志的批评除了带给教育干部底事业以损害外，不会再有其他的结果。
    我们并不需要一切的批评和自我批评，而只需要那种从布尔什维克党和苏维埃国家底政策出发的批评和自我批评，它能帮助党用共产主义精神来教育群众，提高干部底思想和文化水平，增加他们底力量和引向前进。
    我们的党，斯大林同志教导说，并非一切批评都是布尔什维克的、苏维埃的。曾经有一个时期，各种反党的和反苏维埃人民的反对派借着“批评”的幌子大肆活跃。众所周知，比如，托洛茨基反对派曾批评说我国底某些大工业企业是不合算的。对于这个，党也批评过它们。但是党批评亏损的企业为的是要改善它们的工作，帮助它们克服不经济、纪律松弛，而归根结蒂是要使它们巩固起来，成为有利可图的。然而反对派则要求停闭这些工厂，这是对我国工业化底一个打击。托洛茨基派对其余一切问题底“批评”也都带着这种性质：他们力图破坏党性，瓦解苏维埃政权，削弱我们的建设，分解我们的经济干部，解除工人阶级底武装。斯大林同志教导说：“必须把这种异己的、破坏的、反布尔什维克的‘自我批评’与我们的、布尔什维克的自我批评严格区别开来，后者底目的是培植党性，巩固苏维埃政权，改善我们的建设，巩固我们的经济干部，武装工人阶级。”（全集第二卷一三三页）
    为我党所发展的自我批评，可以改善我们的工作，教育和锻炼干部，巩固党的和国家的纪律。

    布尔什维克党保证了发展自我批评，吸收广大工人群众参加缺点底揭露与消灭所需要的一切条件。
    党时时刻刻都关心着干部底思想政治底训练，关心着社会主义社会辛勤劳作者底共产主义教育。马克思列宁主义理论底掌握将提高人们底自觉性，增加他们对于社会主义建设进程底责任感，产生对缺点、错误、对阻滞我们社会走向共产主义底运动的一切采取不调和的态度。理论可以理解事件底深刻意义和内在联系，研究理论可以适时地发现缺点和错误，揭发其根源，迅速找出消灭缺点和错误底方法。
    研究联共（布）历史，研究党和人民底领袖——列宁和斯大林底传记尤其有重大的意义。我们底干部向列宁斯大林学习从党的、原则的立场来估价人们的活动，并对错误和缺点采取不调和的态度。
    在一切社会的组织内——党的、青年团的、苏维埃的、职工会的组织内实行民主是展开批评与自我批评底最重要的条件。没有民主，就没有布尔什维克的批评与自我批评。
    党内民主是一切组织的民主底范例。党内民主保证共产党员积极参加党底生活；党的群众可以自由地和认真地讨论党的政策底问题和实际工作底问题，解决这些问题和达到党底指示之胜利的付诸实施。在党的会议上每一个共产党员都可执行党章所赋予他的权利，批评党底任何工作人员。党内民主是展开批评和自我批评底不可缺少的条件。联共（布）党章上说：“只有在党内民主底基础上：才能展开布尔什维克的自我批评……”
    定期举行党的委员会全会、党的代表会议、党的积极分子会议，对于展开布尔什维克的批评和自我批评有着重大的意义。一九三七年联共（布）中央二、三月全会底决议上写道：“……地方党委底和城市党委底全会，党的代表大会和城市积极分子会议，通常都是展开批评我们工作底缺点和党的领导人，进行自我批评底最好的场所之一，在这里党组织的领导者在下级党的工作人员和党的群众面前报告自己的工作，在这里每个党的工作人员和每个党员都有自由批评和认真批评的权利，都有对工作缺点提出警告底权利。”联共（布）党章上规定定期召开党的积极分子会议，来讨论党和政府底重要决议，并指出说：“积极分子之所以应当召集，不是为了装饰门面和冠冤堂皇地同意这些决议，而是为了有效地讨论它们。”
    实施党内民主底原则，就可以把领导干部放在党组织的监督之下，帮助干部纠正工作中的错误和充实党的群众底经验。党内民主便有可能充分利用批评和自我批评底强有力的武器来同个别共产党员底自高自大、官僚主义、阿谀、小市民底温情以及其他非布尔什维克的特点作斗争，促进领导者与被领导者之间的关系底巩固，引导一切党的和国家的工作日趋改善。凡是没有遵行党内民主，党的会议和积极分子会议、党的委员会，很少召开而且是在低度的思想政治水平上举行的地方，那里就没有批评和自我批评，那里的干部就教育得不正确，那里的领导者就开始丧失在群众面前底责任感，在他们中就造成一种信念以为自己底行动是正确无误的，其结果就产生了对待自我批评底非党的态度，试图抑止它或限制它。
    在一切群众组织内扩展民主乃是发展自下而上的批评和自我批评的必要条件，乃是吸收广大的人民群众参加批评和自我批评的必要条件。斯大林同志说：“无此条件，自我批评就等于零、空话、花言巧语。”
    遵照布尔什维克的原则，按干部的政治品质和工作能力提拔干部，乃是发展批评和自我批评底不可缺少的条件。假如破坏这条规则，把一些同乡、朋友提拔起来，不顾他们底政治品质和工作能力，其结果就会在组织或机关内造成不是负责工作人员底领导核心，而是亲戚朋友底小集团，它力图和平共居，不要彼此“攻击”和不要外扬家丑。按照主观意见和私情提拔干部就会为互相吹嘘，鼓励阿谀造成有利的环境，而对于开展缺点和错误的批评，对于真正布尔什维克的干部教育则不留余地。
    批评与自我批评是同正确地检查执行情形紧密不可分的。关于执行情形底检查的作用和意义，斯大林同志曾下了古典式的定义：“很好地检查执行情形——这是原样的探照灯，它帮助随时查明机关工作底状况，并揭露老爷式的官僚主义和文牍主义者底原形。可以肯定地说：我们底缺点和漏洞，十之九是由于没有正确组织执行情形底检查工作。毫无疑义的，如果有这样的执行情形底检查，那么，缺点和漏洞就可完全预先防止了。”（“列宁主义问题”十一版四八一页）
    对执行情形底自上而下底检查与自下而上的检查相结合，是很重要的，结合的方法是吸收党的和非党的积极分子底最广泛的阶层来参加执行情形底检查。象工人的会议、集体农场的会议、经济的积极分子的会议、生产会议——这些群众的监督形式，都可以促进批评和自我批评底最广泛的发展，都可以揭露缺点，发掘缺点底根源，找出克服缺点底最好的方法。这些监督底形式都可成为以干部的点教育干部的真正的学校。
    批评和自我批评，只有当它不是偶然地采用，而是经常地、系统地、进行的时候才能成为教育干部的有效的方法。常常都是在工作人员犯了重大错误之后，才开始批评他们。而工作底垮台，照例都是逐渐发生的，积小错为大错，都只有当批评和自我批评成为经常有效的工作方法时，才能及时预防工作底垮台。
    报纸在展开批评与自我批评上起很重要的作用。报纸上的批评，公布某工作人员在实际工作中的缺点和错误，乃是教育干部底最有效的方法。报纸上的批评之具有特别重大的意义，还由于它吸收了广大劳动群众来参加与错误和缺点作斗争，因而成为展开自下而上的批评和自我批评底强有力的工具。
    社会主义竞赛乃是批评和自我批评底有卓越意义底形式。斯大林同志说：“社会主义竞赛，乃是群众底实际的革命的自我批评底表现，它是依靠于千百万群众底创造的主动性的。”竞赛底公布，其结果底广泛的讨论，都是以促进批评和自我批评的发展，其时除揭晓成就外，就可以确定工作中缺点底原因，揭发这些缺点底具体的负责者，于是集团就有可能找出更向前进底可靠的道路。
    布尔什维克的干部应当用一切方法推广社会主义竞赛，消除一切那阻碍实际的革命的自我批评和群众底创造的主动性之发展的东西。同时，我们干部底责任是经常研究和总结社会主义竞赛中所产生的新的、进步的东西，并且在这个基础上改善、改进自己的工作。
    民主底展开，对执行情形底系统的检查，社会主义竞赛底增涨——它们是很重要的条件，以使批评和自我批评胜利地担负起布尔什维克教育干部底方法底作用。
    　　　　　　×　　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　　　×
    党以正确的、党的态度对待批评和自我批评底精神来教育干部。以党的态度对待批评和自我批评，就是首先要有勇气公开承认自己的错误，并作出为了迅速消除它所需要的一切。斯大林同志说：“不是隐瞒自己的错误，不是讳言有关自己错误的问题，如我们经常所有的，而是诚恳和公开地承认自己的错误，诚恳而公开地找出纠正这些错误底道路，诚恳而公开地纠正自己的错误，——这是布尔什维克底责任。”
    可是还不是到处都学会了这种对待批评的态度。我们还经常碰到这种工作人员，他不愿倾听群众底呼声，不考虑来自下面的批评，阻滞批评底发展。倾心于平静的、安宁的生活，这些工作人员在自己底发言中避开任何批评的字眼。这是非党的对待批评的态度。党经常坚决地斥责那些试图逃避自我批评，推翻或削弱它底工作人员。还在一九二八年时斯大林同志就说道：“我知道在党底队伍中还有这样的人，他全然不喜欢批评，特别是自我批评。这些人我可以称呼为‘漆涂的’共产主义者，他们常常嚷着，挥开自我批评：他说，又是这个该死的自我批评，又是揭露我们底缺点，难道不能让我们安安生生过日子吗？显而易见的，这些‘漆涂的’共产主义者是同我们党底精神，同布尔什维克底精神没有任何共同之处的。”（“全集”十一卷二八页）
    自我批评底抑止者或不懂自我批评意义的人，通常都借口保持领导者的威信而采取限制和抑止的办法。然而人所共知，领导者底威信之所以破坏只能是因为他们自己对待批评与自我批评的非党的态度。假如工作人员不承认自己的错误，试图狡辩明显的事实，推卸责任，抑制批评与自我批评，那么他无疑地将失去旁人的尊敬，因为大家都可看出在他们面前是一个没有勇气承认自己错误的懦夫，是一个不愿改正自己缺点的坏工作人员，是一个有着微末的、庸俗的自尊的人。而相反地，假使工作人员公开承认自己的错误并坚决为改正错误而斗争，这只能巩固他的威信，引起人们对他的尊敬。每个人都将说：这才是真正的布尔什维克、有勇气的人，可以信赖的人，因为他把公共事业底利益放在狭隘的自尊之上。
    党教导自己的干部勇敢地承认错误。列宁不只一次地警告说，假如坚持小的错误，那就有可能发展为不可救药的大错。我党底历史有过不少的例子，某些人由于坚持自己的错误而走到完全脱离开党，脱离开人民。
    对待批评和自我批评的党的态度，不只要求承认错误：承认错误之后就应当跟着纠正它，这是批评和自我批评底目的。然而有时也会碰到这样的工作人员，他们只限于口头上、形式上承认缺点，答应要改正它……而实际上却继续照老样子工作。
    对于批评底形式的反应，阻碍了某一组织纠正工作中底具体缺点，降低了集团在同缺点作斗争时底积极性，束缚了他底精力、主动性。对于批评底形式的、口头的反应，实质上不是别的，只是抑制自我批评底巧妙的、隐蔽的形式。党要求共产党员不只承认错误，并且首先要改正错误，以真正的批评和自我批评底精神教育干部。
    以党的态度对待批评和自我批评的能力，不是天生的特性：这是共产主义教育底结果。要发展工作人员自我批评底能力，这就是说首先要教他们耐心倾听来自下面的批评。斯大林同志教导说：“为了领导，须要预见。而预见，同志们，可不是容易的。当有一、二十个领导同志看出和注意到我们中的缺点，而工人群众却不愿意或不能看出和注意缺点，——这是一回事。这就有一切机会发生这样的情况，虽然确实看到了，但不是一切都注意到。当与一、二十个领导同志在一起，千百万的工人也看出和注意到我们工作中底缺点，揭发我们的错误，参加建设底总事业和找到改善事业底道路，——这是另一回事了。这里就有更大的保证使意外不再发生，消极的现象将被及时注意，并及时采取消除这些现象底对策。”（“全集”十一卷三五——三六页）
    来自下面的群众的批评之所以需要，还为了顾到和实行巨大的建设经验，这些经验是劳动群众日积月累的结果，其价值之可贵不在领导者底经验之下。
    来自苏维埃人底批评，其目的是要改善苏维埃机关的、党的、职工会的和其他组织底工作，改善经济和文化建设。斯大林同志说必须细心听取来自苏维埃人底任一个批评，即使这批评并非完全的、每一部分都是正确的，因为只有在这条件之下自我批评才能取得真正群众的性质和真正反映群众底意见。
    教育干部以党的态度对待批评与自我批评，乃是形成真正布尔什维克的干部之必要条件。日丹诺夫同志在关于“星”和“列宁格勒”杂志底报告中强调指出了每个布尔什维克的工作人员，以严格的自我批评底态度对待自己事业底重大意义。他说：“斯大林同志屡次指出，我们发展底最重要条件是必须每个苏维埃人每天总结自己的工作，毫无畏惧地检查自己，分析自己的工作，勇敢地批评自己的缺点和错误，深思熟虑怎样才能使自己的工作达到更好的结果，并且为改善自己而不间断地工作……谁害怕批评自己的工作，谁就是卑劣的懦夫，就不配受到人民的尊敬。”
    对待批评和自我批评底党的态度是在于要做到领导自我批评，指导自我批评。领导自我批评，这不是说在口头上，而是在实际上用一切方法推动它的发展，时时刻刻采用于实际，教育干部靠批评与自我批评克服缺点，消除错误和向前推进。更重要的是要会揭发错误底根源；这才能帮助正确地找出克服它底方法。然而实际上往往把批评归结到某一工作人员在其活动中的缺点的检证，之后就形式地建议他把缺点改除。由于错误底根源仍然没有揭露，工作人员继续以旧的方法工作，最后还是把工作弄垮台。
    领导自我批评，这就是说要认真听取每一个批评的意见，特别是来自下面底批评，并同一切抑止批评和自我批评底试图进行不调和的斗争，把这种试图看作是阻碍我们前进底试图。直接的抑止自我批评，在我们的时代是很少碰到的了，因此更有必要同抑制批评和自我批评底隐蔽的形式作斗争，它或者忽视批评和自我批评，或者对批评和自我批评采取形式的态度，只是口头上、空虚地答应纠正错误或只是当作官样文章。
    解决批评和自我批评底最好的方法是使它发生效力。假如领导者在党的或工人的会议上报告对上次会议所作底批评采取了什么措施，假如因报纸底警告、因工人的通信和怨言而立即采取办法，假如批评底积极成果公之于大众，那么工作人员就会越来越多地开始理解布尔什维主义这一光辉武器底意义，并采用它。
    在开展自我批评中，干部底个人的榜样，有很大的意义。随时随地，特别是在党的、工人的和集体农场的会议上的演说里，在报纸上，领导的工作人员应当指出勇敢的、坦白的、原则的自我批评底典型，举出例子说明如何分析错误，揭露缺点底根源，并找出纠正底办法。会议底性质，往往决定于领导者的演讲：它是在认真的批评和自我批评底空气中进行呢，还是装装门面和歌颂成绩。
    全力助成批评和自我批评底发展，这是每个党的和非党的布尔什维克底责任。在这里党的领导者的作用特别重大，因为党把在他所领导的党的组织内发展批评和自我批评底重任托付给他。
    在目前条件之下，当在苏维埃人民面前摆着完成社会主义社会底建设和逐渐由社会主义过渡到共产主义底巨大任务的时候，不能不向我们底干部提出更高的要求。他们对于缺点愈是采取不调和的态度，愈是展开有效的批评和自我批评（这是布尔什维克教育干部底经过考验的方法，是我们前进底重要条件），他们完成自己任务就愈顺利。
