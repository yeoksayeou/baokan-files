Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 19th: Paris News: Because the Bidault reactionary government and manufacturers refuse to meet the legitimate demands of raising the extremely low living standards of the working people, the National Committee of the French General Confederation of Labor issued a declaration on the 17th, calling on all working people in the country to actively participate in the 24-hour national general strike on the 25th of this month. The demands put forward by this general strike are: (1) Pay each worker a monthly allowance of 3,000 francs, and incorporate the previous allowance into the current wage; (2) Wages should be freely discussed between employers and trade unions, guaranteeing a minimum wage according to living expenses, and opposing government-forced arbitration; (3) Increase unemployment relief and abolish wage differences in various regions.
The National Committee of the General Confederation of Labor emphasized in its inspiring declaration: "This strike is not the end of it, but will be a new stage in the struggle against poverty and reaction." The declaration calls on all workers to have courage and confidence, believing that "the unity of the working class will guarantee a glorious victory." The declaration also exposes and condemns the conspiracy of the Socialist Party's "Workers' Force" union to put forward strike slogans while opposing unified trade union action, and points out that the purpose of the "Workers' Force" union leaders in calling for a strike is to make workers hostile to each other. They know that if such a strike movement fails, it will demoralize the workers and strengthen the position of employers and government reactionaries.
In order to call on all members to support this strike, the General Confederation of Labor has ordered all members to establish unified action committees in various workplaces and hold votes in favor of the strike.

　　法国总工会发表宣言
  　号召全国总罢工
  　要求加强斗争统一行动
    【新华社北京十九日电】巴黎消息：由于皮杜尔反动政府和制造商拒绝满足提高劳动人民极低的生活水准的合法要求，法国总工会全国委员会于十七日发表宣言，号召全国一切劳动人民积极参加本月二十五日的二十四小时全国总罢工。这次总罢工所提出的要求是：（一）每月付给每一工人三千法郎津贴，而将前此的津贴并入现在的工资中；（二）由雇主与工会间自由讨论工资，照生活费用保证最低的工资，反对政府强迫仲裁；（三）增加失业救济金和废除各地区工资的差额。
    总工会全国委员会在其鼓舞人心的宣言中着重指出：“这次罢工并不是罢了就完，而将是在反抗贫穷和反动的斗争中的一个新阶段”。宣言号召所有工人要有勇气和信心，坚信“工人阶级的团结将保证赢得辉煌的胜利”。宣言也揭露并谴责社会党“工人力量”工会提出罢工口号而又反对工会组织统一行动的阴谋，并指出“工人力量”工会领袖们号召罢工的目的在使工人彼此敌对。他们知道这样一个罢工运动如遭失败，会使工人丧气，会加强雇主和政府反动派的地位。
    总工会为号召一切会员支持这一罢工，已命令所有会员在各种工作地点建立统一行动委员会，并举行赞成罢工的投票。
