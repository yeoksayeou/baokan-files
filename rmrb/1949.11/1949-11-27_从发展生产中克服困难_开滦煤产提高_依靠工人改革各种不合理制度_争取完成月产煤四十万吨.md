　　Overcoming Difficulties Through Developing Production
  　Kailuan Coal Production Increases
    Relying on Workers to Reform Unreasonable Systems and Striving to Complete a Monthly Coal Output of 400,000 Tons
    [Special Dispatch from Tangshan by Our Correspondent] Since the Chief Military Representative stationed at Kailuan Coal Mine put forward the policy of supporting Kailuan's production by developing production in mid-October, certain achievements have been made through preliminary reforms.

    Kailuan is one of China's famous large coal mines, with a history of more than 70 years. Its annual coal output is more than 6 million tons, and its reserves can be mined for at least another 200 years. The coal produced is sold far to Central China, South China, and even Japan, Korea, and Southeast Asia. Its scale and equipment are among the best in China's existing coal mines. Although the mine was plundered by Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang reactionary government over the years, under the protection of the Kailuan working class with its glorious revolutionary tradition, the machinery and mines were not damaged or destroyed in the slightest during the liberation of Tangshan, which prepared good conditions for restoring and developing production. However, in the ten months since liberation, Kailuan's total coal output has only been 2.46 million tons, with the average monthly output even lower than 30% last year. In July of this year, the coal output was 340,000 tons, the highest amount after liberation, but the total monthly expenditure was greater than the total value of the coal produced. As for the cost of Kailuan coal, it is higher than that of the state-owned coal mines in North China. The cost of each ton of coal in the state-owned coal mines in North China is 40 to 50 catties of millet, while Kailuan coal requires more than two bags of flour. The price of coal transported to Tianjin is much higher than the market price.

    After the liberation of Kailuan, the North China People's Government provided a great deal of assistance to support its restoration of production. According to statistics before June, the National Bank had successively loaned Kailuan more than 120,000 yuan. After June, the People's Government exchanged 200,000 bags of flour per month for its coal, enabling Kailuan's production to be maintained. Due to poor management, neither production order nor labor discipline has been well established. The reason for this phenomenon is that there is no clear policy for developing production. As a result, they are at a loss in the face of difficulties, waiting for government support, and even hoping to find a way out by raising coal prices, monopolizing the market, and exporting coal. Under these circumstances, the mine's trade union also failed to pay attention to studying the production situation, abandoned the working class's leading role in enterprise production, and some even one-sidedly emphasized employee welfare, blindly "following the masses," which also affected production. It was not until mid-October that the Chief Military Representative stationed at the mine convened an enlarged meeting of the mine's Party committee, military representatives, trade union, and activists among the workers, using the lessons learned from the past ten months to criticize the above-mentioned ideological deviations, and clearly put forward the policy of relying on workers to overcome difficulties by developing production and reforming unreasonable systems, requiring efforts to complete the specific task of producing 400,000 tons of coal per month. The specific measures are as follows:

    (1) Increase direct production personnel and coal miners, and reduce indirect production personnel and non-production personnel. In the past, the number of personnel above ground at Kailuan Coal Mine generally accounted for about 25%, and the number of underground personnel accounted for about 75%. Now, the number of personnel above ground is 46.5%, and the number of underground personnel is 53.5%. The reduction in production personnel is the basic reason for the decrease in production. (2) Improve the efficiency of coal miners. In July, August, and September of last year, the efficiency of coal miners was above 930 kilograms. In the same period this year, the highest was only 894 kilograms. Now that the conditions are better than last year, it should be quickly increased to 950 kilograms, and strive to exceed 1,000 kilograms in the shortest possible time. (3) Gradually reform unreasonable wage, personnel, organizational, and management systems. First, the mine, the trade union, and the military representative should jointly study and unify their opinions before gradually implementing them. The adjustment of the excessively disparate salary system among employees was implemented on the first of this month. (4) Strictly rectify labor discipline. After the rectification in August, there has been great improvement. The current problem is that management personnel are not responsible, and the mine is also responsible for rectification.

    After the workers understood the current difficulties of Kailuan and the methods to overcome them, the workers above ground automatically held meetings to evaluate the personnel who could go down the mine. The Youth League members took the lead in going down the mine, and the underground workers, in welcoming the workers above ground, guaranteed to make their work satisfactory. And they automatically rose up to rectify labor discipline, and looked for useful tools from waste iron and scrap materials. With unprecedented labor enthusiasm, the coal mining efficiency was immediately improved. Since October 15, the average efficiency of coal miners has increased to 993 kilograms, of which seven days exceeded 1,000 kilograms, and the daily output of the entire mine has also increased from 9,700 tons before October 15 to 13,000 tons. Under the influence and promotion of the workers' active labor, the mine is also making plans, issuing instructions, and changing the management personnel's consistent irresponsible attitude towards production; and together with the trade union and the military representative, formed a nine-member committee (three members each) to lead the development of production and reform unreasonable systems, responsible for leading all major events related to production. In late October, a joint meeting of mine directors and administrative heads was held, and the trade union and military representatives were invited to participate. Personnel from the three parties studied production together for the first time. From then on, Kailuan will gradually overcome difficulties and various unreasonable systems, and embark on the road of developing production.

　　从发展生产中克服困难
  　开滦煤产提高
    依靠工人改革各种不合理制度  争取完成月产煤四十万吨
    【本报记者唐山专讯】开滦煤矿的生产，自十月中旬驻该矿总军事代表提出从发展生产中扶植开滦生产的方针后，经过初步改革，已取得了一定的成绩。
    开滦是我国有名的大煤矿之一，至今有七十多年的历史，年产煤炭六百多万吨，其蕴藏量至少还可开采二百年。产煤远销华中、华南乃至日本朝鲜与南洋，其规模之宏大，设备之完善，在我国现有煤矿中均不多见。该矿虽经日寇和国民党反动政府历年搜刮，但在具有光荣革命传统的开滦工人阶级护卫下，唐山解放时机器矿井未受丝毫损失或破坏，给恢复与发展生产准备下良好的条件。但解放至今十月有余，开滦全矿产煤仅只二百四十六万吨，每月平均量尚低于去年百分之三十。本年七月产煤三十四万吨，为解放后的最高额，但全月开支却大于产煤总值。至于滦煤成本，则高于华北各公营煤矿。华北各公营煤矿每吨煤的成本是四、五十斤小米，滦煤却要两袋多面粉。运到天津的价格比市场售价还高得多。
    开滦解放后，华北人民政府为扶助其恢复生产，曾给予大量援助。据六月前的统计，国家银行先后贷给开滦的款项有十二万万元之多，六月以后，人民政府则以每月二十万袋面粉的实物换取其煤斤，使开滦生产得以维持。由于该矿本身管理不善，生产秩序与劳动纪律均未很好建立。形成这种现象的原因是由于没有明确发展生产的方针，因而在困难前面束手无策，坐待政府支援，甚至希望从高抬煤价，垄断市场与煤斤出口上找出路。在此情况下，该矿职工会也未能注意研究生产情况，放弃了工人阶级在企业生产中的领导作用，有的甚至片面的强调职工福利，盲目的“跟着群众走”，使生产也受到影响。直至十月中旬，驻矿总军事代表召开各矿党委、军事代表、工会、及工人中的积极分子扩大会议，以十个月来的事实教训，对上述思想偏向做了批判，明确提出依靠工人从发展生产中克服困难，改革不合理制度的方针，要求为完成月产四十万吨煤的具体任务而努力。其具体措施如下：
    （一）增加直接生产人员与采煤工人，紧缩间接生产人员与非生产人员。过去开滦煤矿井上人员一般占百分之二十五左右，井下人员占百分之七十五上下；现在井上人员是百分之四十六点五，井下人员为百分之五十三点五，生产人员的减少这是生产减少的基本原因。（二）提高煤工效率。去年七、八、九三个月中，煤工效率均在九百三十公斤以上，今年同一时期最高才有八百九十四公斤，现在各种条件比去年好，故应迅速提高到九百五十公斤，并争取在最短期间超过一千公斤。（三）逐步改革不合理的工资、人事、组织、管理等制度。先由矿方、工会、军事代表共同研究，统一意见后逐步实行。关于调整职工间过于悬殊的工薪制度已于本月一日实行。（四）严整劳动纪律。八月间整顿后，已有很大改进，目前问题是管理人员不负责，亦责成矿方负责整顿。
    当工人们了解了开滦当前的困难及克服困难的方法之后，井上工人自动召开会议，评判可能下井的人员，青年团员带头下井，井下工友在欢迎井上工友中，保证使他们工作满意。并自动起来整顿劳动纪律。从废铁烂料中寻找有用的工具。以前所未有的劳动热情，立即提高了采煤效率。自十月十五日后，煤工平均效率已提高到九百九十三公斤，其中有七天超过了一千公斤以上，全矿日产量也由十五日前的九千七百吨，提高到一万三千吨。在工人积极劳动的影响和推动下，矿方也在订计划、发指示，改变管理人员一贯对生产不负责的态度；并和工会及军事代表共同组成了领导发展生产与改革不合理制度的九人委员会（各三人），负责领导一切有关生产的大事。十月下旬，又召开了各矿长与行政负责人联席会，并邀请工会及军事代表参加，三方面人员第一次在一起共同研究生产。从此，开滦将逐渐克服困难与各种不合理的制度，走上发展生产的道路。
