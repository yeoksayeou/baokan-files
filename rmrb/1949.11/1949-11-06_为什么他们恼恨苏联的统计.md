Why They Hate Soviet Statistics
By N. Sergeeva, translated by Li Wenhai

For those propagandists of the "American way of life," Soviet statistics are like the red cloth to a bullfighter. American newspapers and radio stations often view Soviet statistics with a jaundiced eye (i.e., a "yellow eye" – translator).

What is so bad about these statistics? Obviously, American business tycoons, political hacks, and newsmongers find these statistics unpalatable, first and foremost because they reflect the rapid development of the socialist economy and its powerful, planned rise. Because these Soviet successes, against the backdrop of the capitalist world full of economic hardships and disasters, along with its Marshall Plan and currency wars, are particularly prominent.

Needless to say, American journalists and radio commentators will never explain their annoyance with this true reason. Their job is simply to cast doubt on these statistics left and right. They ask: why are these statistics mostly recorded in percentages of increased output? They inquire: where have all the "pure numbers" gone?

On this point, the New York Times and "Voice of America" chose the United Nations' 1948 and first quarter 1949 report on the world economic situation to stir up new malicious clamor. This report, in addition to other indicators, also cited Soviet economic indicators, and American commentators were severely stung by the fact that the Soviet economy was far above the Marshall Plan countries. But since they could not refute this undeniable fact, they had to take their anger out on the numbers—they wanted nothing else but "pure numbers."

If we were to assume for a moment that the people in charge of "Voice of America" and the bosses of the New York Times were genuinely interested in studying the Soviet economy, then we can inform them that, in addition to those percentage figures that clearly illustrate the rapid progress of the Soviet economy, there are many formal, very interesting pure numbers that have been published. Here are some of them: Approximately four thousand state-owned industrial enterprises have been established or restarted in 1946, 1947, and 1948; at the same time, in agricultural areas, more than one million six hundred thousand houses have been built or renovated; in 1948, the Soviet Union's cultivated land increased by thirteen million eight hundred thousand acres compared to 1947; in 1948, one hundred and twenty-two thousand skilled specialized technicians graduated from our higher education institutions, which is twenty thousand more than in 1940.

These are pure numbers. And if, in certain areas, production figures cannot be published for national security reasons, then everyone will understand why those who are busy openly preparing for war against the Soviet Union are so interested in precisely these figures. Furthermore, there is another reason for using percentages: percentages provide a clear illustration of the basic and most important thing—the direction and rate of economic progress. The report published by the United Nations Secretariat pointed out the sharp contrast between the industrial development of the United States and the Soviet Union. Soviet industry increased its output by 27 percent in 1948 compared to 1947. In the United States, output increased by only 3 percent in 1948 compared to 1947. In the first quarter of this year, U.S. industrial production decreased by 5 percent, while the Soviet Union increased by 23 percent.

Of course, it would be too naive to think that any figure showing the achievements of the socialist economy and the increasing prosperity of the Soviet people's lives—whether pure numbers or percentages—would be acknowledged by the New York Times and "Voice of America." This group of gentlemen will never tell the truth about things in the Soviet Union to the American people. On the contrary, their purpose is to slander the Soviet Union. All the figures showing the economic achievements of the Soviet Union make the American reactionaries angry, because these figures inevitably lead millions of people to make all sorts of comparisons that are unfavorable to the capitalist economic system.

It is worth noting that what makes the New York Times and "Voice of America" most furious is that the Soviet Union has no hired labor. This one fact completely demolishes the elaborate edifice of rumors carefully constructed by that group of "American way of life" propagandists.

These slanders connected with the United Nations' report on the world economic situation and Soviet statistics began precisely with Truman's report to Congress on the state of the American economy. This presidential report was delivered in an official optimistic tone, a tone used by politicians who dare not open their eyes to the painful reality. Truman declared that he looked forward to the future with complete confidence. But when he described the economic situation of their country to the American people, he did not cite any figures—pure numbers or percentages—to support his declarations.

His most moving figure was three million two hundred thousand unemployed people. This figure is moving mainly because it is obviously a lie. In reality, the number of unemployed and partially unemployed people in the United States has approached fifteen million, a figure mentioned by the American Federation of Labor.

Truman's report did nothing to alleviate the American people's concerns about the impending economic crisis. It only increased this concern, because it revealed that the American government had exhausted its resources to the point of only being able to paint a rosy picture and unable to take any effective measures to alleviate the plight of the working people who will bear the brunt of the crisis.

This explains why American reactionaries are so indignant when they see Soviet economic statistics. Because these statistics are a counsel to the capitalist economic system and the various prospects of the socialist world. (Translated from New Times, 1949, No. 30)

### 为什么他们恼恨苏联的统计

　　为什么他们恼恨苏联的统计
    Ｎ·塞尔盖耶娃作  李文海译
    对于那些“美国生活方式”的宣传家们，苏联的统计数字就如同斗牛勇士的红布对那大水牛一样的作用。美国的报纸，广播，常常以黄疸病的眼光（即“黄色的眼”——译者）来看苏联的统计数字。
    这些统计有甚么不妙之处呢？显然的，美国的商业大亨，政治棍徒，新闻贩子们对这些统计很不开胃，首先而又最重要的因为这些统计反映了社会主义经济的迅速发展，以及它的计划性的有力的上升。因为这些苏联的成功，比起满是经济磨难与灾害的资本主义世界，连同它的马歇尔计划及钞票战争一起的背景，是特别显得凸出的。
    不用说，美国的记者和广播评论员是绝不会拿这真正理由来解释他们的恼怒的。他们的差事只是去对这些统计左怀疑、右怀疑。他们问：为甚么这些统计多半是用百分率来记载输出的增加呢？他们追问：“纯粹数字”都到那里去了？
    在这一点上，纽约时报和“美国之音”选取了联合国的一九四八及一九四九年第一季的世界经济状况报告借以掀起新的恶毒的叫嚣。这报告除举出了其他指数外，也举出了苏联的经济指数，而美国评论员们可被这事实，即苏联经济远在马歇尔计划国家之上所狠狠的刺伤了。可是由于他们无法驳倒这无可争辩的事实，他们只好找数字来出气——他们不要别的，只要“纯粹数字”。
    要是我们姑且假设一下，说“美国之音”的负责人员和纽约时报老板们是真有兴趣去研究一下苏联经济的，那么我们可以正告他们说：除了有那些清楚地图了解苏联经济的迅速进展的百分率数字之外，还有许多正式的，很有意思的纯粹数字已经公布了。下面是其中一些：约有四千所国营工业机构已在一九四六、一九四七及一九四八年建立或者复工；与此同时，在农业区中，有一百六十万余所住宅建好或修建好；一九四八年苏联的熟田比一九四七年增加了一千三百八十万俄亩；一九四八年有十二万二千名熟练的专门技术工人在我们的高等教育机构毕业，这比一九四○年多了二万名。
    这些都是纯粹数字。而若有在某些项目方面，为了国家安全，不能公布生产数字，那么每个人无论如何也会了解到，为什么偏偏在这些数字上面，那些忙于公开筹备对苏作战的人那样感兴趣了。此外，还有一个用百分数的原因：百分数作出了显明的图示，表明了基本的而又最重要的事情——经济进展方向与进展的速率。联合国秘书处发表的报告指出了美国的与苏联的工业发展二者之间的强烈对比。苏联工业在一九四八年岁输出方面比一九四七年增加了百分之二十七。而在美国，一九四八年岁输出比一九四七年只增加了百分之三。今年第一季，美国工业生产量减缩了百分之五，而苏联却增加了百分之二十三。
    当然，要想任何一项表明了社会主义经济成就及苏联人民生活日趋丰裕的数字——不论是纯粹数字或是百分数——会得到纽约时报及“美国之音”承认，那就太天真了。这一批绅士们绝不会把苏联国土上的事物真相告诉美国人民大众的。正相反，他们的目的是要污蔑苏联。所有表明苏联经济成就的数字都使得美国反动派生气，因为这些数字必然地引导千万人民去作种种不利于资本主义经济体系的比较。
    值得注意的是：最使得纽约时报及“美国之音”气昏的事情就是苏联没有雇佣劳动。就这一件事实就把那批“美国生活方式”宣传家们所精心细构的谣言大厦完全推倒。
    这些连系着联合国关于世界经济状况报告的对苏联统计的谰言，正起于杜鲁门对国会报告美国经济地位之时。这份总统的报告是用的一种官方的乐观的腔调，是一种不敢睁眼看痛苦现实的政客所用的腔调。杜鲁门宣称以完全信心瞻望着将来。但当他向美国人民叙述他们国家的经济状况的时候，他却并没有引用任何数字——纯粹数字或是百分率的——去支持他的宣言。
    他的最动人的数字是三百二十万失业人数。这数字之所以动人主要是因为它是明显地谎报的。实际上，美国失业及部分失业人数已接近于一千五百万，这数字是美国工联所提到的。
    杜鲁门的报告将丝毫没缓和美国人民对即将到来的经济危机的忧虑。它只是增加了这忧虑，因为它暴露了美国政府已经技穷到只能粉饰太平，而不能采取任何有效措施去减轻那些将在危机前首当其冲的劳动人民的恶运。
    这说明为什么美国反动派看到苏联的经济统计时那样愤恨。因为这些统计是一个对着资本主义经济体系与社会主义世界的各种前途的忠告者。（译自新时代一九四九年三十期）
