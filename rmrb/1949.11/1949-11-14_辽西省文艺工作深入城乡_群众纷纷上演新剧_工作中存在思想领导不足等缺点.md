Xinhua News Agency, Jinzhou, 13th: Literary and art work in Liaoxi Province is being widely developed. Currently, in addition to the provincial art troupe, 14 counties and cities have established propaganda teams. There are a total of 560 amateur theatrical groups in factories, rural areas, government offices, and schools throughout the region. In the six counties of Tieling, Kaiyuan, Changtu, and Beizhen alone, there are 243 farmer amateur theatrical groups. Blackboards for propaganda are common in most districts and villages throughout the province. Cultural centers and propaganda teams have been universally established in six counties, and rooftop broadcasting stations are common in the villages of seven counties. Reformed donkey-hide shadow plays and peep shows are popular in 11 counties.

Over the past nine months, various activities of literary and art work in Liaoxi Province have been closely integrated with the province's current political tasks and the central work of economic construction. Before the spring plowing, the province organized nine propaganda teams to go to the countryside to promote preparations for spring plowing, the development of sideline occupations, and enlistment in the army. After April, attention was paid to carrying out literary and art activities in urban factories, and experiences were summarized and cadres trained at the same time. Since the end of summer hoeing in September, propaganda has been widely launched against "turning back the handle" (landlord counter-offensive activities), exposing reactionary secret societies, and production for disaster relief. Because literary and art activities reflect the lives of the masses, they are very popular. The masses are staging new dramas one after another. Also, because literary and art activities have promoted practical work, they have better obtained the attention and help of local administrative leaders. At the Provincial Congress of Literary and Art Workers held in the middle of last month, the main shortcomings that still existed in the past literary and art work were reviewed, namely, more emphasis on business leadership than ideological leadership; a bias towards the form of drama, neglecting other forms of literature and art, and paying attention to popularization while neglecting key improvements. After heated discussions, the meeting further clarified that the orientation of literary and art work should be to serve political struggle and economic construction, and determined that in the future, while not abandoning the principle of strengthening urban literary and art work, the focus should be on rural areas, but at the same time paying attention to strengthening urban literary and art work.

    辽西省文艺工作深入城乡
    群众纷纷上演新剧
    工作中存在思想领导不足等缺点
    【新华社锦州十三日电】辽西省的文艺工作广泛开展。目前除省文工团外，已经有十四个县、市建立了宣传队，各地工厂、农村、机关、学校的业余剧团共有五百六十个，仅铁岭、开原、昌北、北镇等六县农民业余剧团就有二百四十三个。黑板报普及全省大部区村，文化馆、宣传队已在六个县普遍建立，屋顶广播台则遍及七个县的乡村。经过改造的驴皮影戏、拉洋片等民间艺术已经在十一个县中风行。
    九个月来，辽西省文艺工作的各种活动都密切地结合着该省当前的政治任务和经济建设的中心工作。春耕前，全省组织了九个宣传队下乡，进行准备春耕、发展副业和参军等宣传。四月以后，开始注意开展城市工厂的文艺活动，并同时总结了经验和训练了干部。九月份结束夏锄以来，就普遍展开了反“翻把”（地主反攻活动）、揭发反动会门和生产救灾的宣传。由于文艺活动反映了群众生活，很受群众欢迎，群众纷纷上演新剧。又由于文艺活动推动了实际工作，因而也更好地取得了各地行政领导上的重视和帮助。在上月中旬召开的全省文艺工作者代表大会上，曾检讨出过去的文艺工作中还存在的主要缺点为业务的领导多于思想的领导；偏重于戏剧的形式，忽视其他的文艺形式，注意了普及而忽视了有重点的提高。会议经过热烈讨论后，更加明确了文艺工作要为政治斗争和经济建设服务的方针，并确定今后在不放弃加强城市文艺工作的原则下，重点应放在农村，但同时注意加强城市文艺工作。
