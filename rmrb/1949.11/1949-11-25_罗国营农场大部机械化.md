Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 22nd – A TASS dispatch from Moscow: The "Truth" newspaper recently published a Bucharest dispatch by Struchekov, reporting on the work of Romanian state-run farms, saying:

　　The "Kirnoy" farm, with more than 6,500 hectares of land, employs many former hired farmhands. They used to live a slave-like life under landlords and rich peasants, but now they have become the masters of the country. They have a deep sense of responsibility for their work and are increasingly applying the Soviet Lysenko's method of spring wheat cultivation, fertilizers, artificial irrigation methods for rice planting, and other methods to ensure a good harvest. As a result, the rice harvest is twice as large as that of individual farmers, and the wheat harvest is twice as large. The lives of the "Kirnoy" farm workers have already changed. New houses are being built, and the farm has its own hospital, clinic, library, adult school, and child welfare institutions.

　　As of September this year, Romania has organized approximately 800 such state-run farms on the land formerly owned by landlords, covering an area of more than 700,000 hectares. These state-run farms have 2,350 tractors made in both China and the Soviet Union. The sown area and harvest volume are increasing year by year. In 1949, the total output of winter wheat and spring wheat increased by 197 percent compared to 1948, oats increased by 305 percent, corn harvest was four times more than last year, and potatoes were six times more. Soon, 90 percent of all agricultural work on state-run farms will be mechanized. Currently, Romania's state-run farms are promoting large-scale mechanized farming based on modern technology and agricultural science among the broad masses of farmers, showing its superiority over small individual agriculture.

　　罗国营农场大部机械化
    【新华社北京二十二日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报顷刊载斯特鲁契科夫的布加勒斯特通讯，报道罗马尼亚国营农场的工作情形称：
    “基尔诺伊”农场，有六千五百多公顷土地，在这农场中工作的人多是从前的雇农。他们以前在地主和富农手下过着奴隶般的生活，现在却成为国家的主人了。他们对工作有极深的责任感，并越来越多地应用苏联李森科的小麦春莳方法、肥料和种稻的人工灌溉方法以及其他保证丰收的方法，因而稻的收获量较个体农民多一倍，小麦多两倍。“基尔诺伊”农场工人的生活都已经改变了。新的房舍正在建筑着，农场有自己的医院、急诊所、图书馆、成人学校及儿童福利机构。
    到今年九月为止，罗马尼亚已经在从前地主的土地上组织了约八百个这样的国营农场，面积超过七十万公顷。在这些国营农场里，有本国和苏联制造的拖拉机二三五○台。播种面积和收获量逐年增加，一九四九年，冬小麦和春小麦的总产量较一九四八年增加了百分之一九七，燕麦增加了百分之三○五，玉蜀黍收获量较去年多四倍，马铃薯为去年的六倍。国营农场的全部农事工作，不久将有百分之九十机械化。目前，罗马尼亚的国营农场，正在广大的农民群众中，宣传基于现代技术和农业科学的大规模机械化耕作，优于小的个体农业。
