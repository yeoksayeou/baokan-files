Beijing Municipal Government Land Administration Bureau
　Orders Registration of Public and Private Real Estate
　　[Beijing News] In order to protect the legitimate property rights of the people, the Municipal People's Government began to conduct registration of public and private real estate in the city's urban area on June 16 of this year. Over the past few months, most property owners have gone to the Land Administration Bureau to apply for registration, but there are still a few property owners who have not yet applied. In order to complete this registration as soon as possible, the Municipal Land Administration Bureau now specifically stipulates that all unregistered real estate, vacant land, and agricultural land in the city's urban area must be registered with the bureau from now until the end of January 1950 (those who have already obtained ownership certificates from the bogus Land Administration Bureau and whose property rights have not changed may postpone registration). Those who register after the deadline will be punished according to regulations; those who still do not register after the deadline will not have their property rights guaranteed, and once discovered, they will be severely punished.
