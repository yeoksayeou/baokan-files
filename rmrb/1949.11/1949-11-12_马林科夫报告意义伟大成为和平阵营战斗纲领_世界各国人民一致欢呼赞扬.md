Hungarian newspapers all published editorials on the 9th, commenting on Malenkov's report. The Hungarian Trade Union newspaper, People's Voice, stated: This is a report of epoch-making significance because it summarizes the achievements of our struggle to defend peace, reviews all the forces advancing in the anti-imperialist peace camp under the leadership of the great socialist Soviet Union and under the banner of the great Stalin, and instills confidence in their own strength in the hearts of hundreds of millions of people. The newspaper emphasized: This report so strongly demonstrates the strength and superiority of the Soviet Union that it has become the fighting program of hundreds of millions of people fighting for peace.

The editorial of the Czech Communist Party newspaper, Red Rights, emphasized: Malenkov not only expressed the Soviet people's will to fight for peace, but also the will of the victorious Chinese people, the people of the people's democratic countries who are advancing along the socialist road, and the fighters against the Tito fascists in Yugoslavia, as well as the will of the working class in Italy, France, and other capitalist countries. The newspaper stated: Today, there is no force in the world that can stop the global victory of socialism and democracy.

Bulgarian newspapers all published commentaries on the 9th. The Izgrev newspaper editorial stated: "Malenkov's report is a brilliant Marxist-Leninist analysis of the Soviet Union's achievements, the international situation, and the balance of power between the two camps. Malenkov pointed out the bright prospects facing all nations." The newspaper pointed out: The Soviet Union's peace policy has won the respect of hundreds of millions of people around the world who participate in the world peace movement. These hundreds of millions of people are capable of containing the aggressors.

Romania's Viata Sindicala stated: "As long as we follow the shining example of the Soviet Union, strengthen and deepen our friendship with socialist countries, and as long as we are loyal to the teachings of the party of Lenin and Stalin, then no enemy can resist us."

The US Communist Party newspaper, the Daily Worker, published the full text of Malenkov's report. The newspaper also published an editorial emphasizing that the proposal put forward by the Soviet Union to declare the atomic bomb illegal and to establish long-term peace between the United States and socialist countries should be accepted.

Italian progressive newspapers all published the full text of Malenkov's report under large headlines. The newspaper's headline stated: "The great October Revolution has survived and triumphed in the struggle for peace, democracy, and socialism." The Evening Post and People's Paper both emphasized the following proposition of Malenkov's speech: If the imperialists launch a third world war, they will "dig the grave for capitalism."

The commentary in the Australian Communist Party newspaper, the Tribune, pointed out: Malenkov's report strengthens the forces of peace and is a new blow to the warmongers.

Swiss newspapers published fairly detailed excerpts from Malenkov's report. Many newspapers emphasized in their headlines the strength of the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union's desire for peace, and the Soviet Union's adherence to the Potsdam Agreement, and pointed out Malenkov's comments on the Marshall Plan.

The headline in the An-Nida newspaper in Damascus, the capital of Syria, carrying a summary of Malenkov's report was: "The Soviet Union uses atomic energy to develop industry. The Soviet Union claims: The United States is trying to build a world empire, thereby enslaving the whole world."

Many newspapers in Beirut, the capital of Lebanon, also published brief summaries of Malenkov's report. The headline in Al-Hayat newspaper was: "The Soviet Union does not want war, but it is preventing war."
