The wage system of remuneration according to labor
    ——Dalian Communication Five (Conclusion)
    By Our Reporter Tian Liu

Another major benefit of the progressive piece-rate wage system is that it promotes the scientific management of factories. Because to achieve "excess," there must first be a "quota" and precise staffing (i.e., "fixed personnel"), it is necessary to study the organization of labor, record machine utilization rates, and further understand machine efficiency. This work, in turn, directly assists in the accuracy of production plans and staffing quotas, making production management increasingly perfect and gradually rationalized.

A bonus wage system should be implemented, and model workers who are proactive in production, exceed their targets, and improve technology should be rewarded. Like anything else, without rewarding progress, it is impossible to improve backwardness.

3. Piece-Rate Wage System

The "piece-rate wage system," which has been implemented and is still being vigorously promoted in the Lüda area, is a further development after the implementation of the progressive piece-rate wage system based on the seven-grade wage system. Numerous experiences have proven that this is the most advanced wage system. More than 80% of employees in the Soviet Union have implemented this wage system (see the book "Soviet Economic Work Methods" - reporter's note). By the end of this year, 70% of workers in Lüda's public enterprises will also implement piece-rate wages. Its characteristic is that it can better unleash the enthusiasm and creativity of workers, more effectively utilize machines, and better organize labor. Some people misunderstand that the piece-rate wage system is the commonly known contracting system, but it is fundamentally different from the bourgeoisie's contracting system. This can be clearly seen from the handling of the following key issues related to the piece-rate wage.

First is the issue of "technical norms." Without technical norms (called "estimating work" in North China), it is impossible to implement piece-rate wages. The technical norms in the Lüda area are formulated based on the technical level of intermediate or the majority of workers, or the average technical level of workers (excluding apprentices). It should not and cannot be based on the standard of a few skilled workers, making it unattainable for ordinary workers, thus objectively limiting workers' progress. Nor should it be based on the standard of the lowest-skilled workers, which, although "beneficial" to workers in the short term, will inevitably increase costs, cause losses to the enterprise, and inevitably cause losses to the workers. Improving technical norms is the joint responsibility of all workers and factory management personnel. The improvement of the technology of the majority of workers will inevitably promote the improvement of technical norms. Therefore, once technical norms are determined, they should not be changed frequently. In the Soviet Union, they are changed once every six months or a year. In Lüda, they are changed once every six months and are included in the collective contract. The contract stipulates: "The determination of work quotas and piece-rate wage standards shall not be less than six months. After the expiration, it shall be reviewed and re-determined according to the rationalization of labor organization and the improvement of technical equipment. In the event that the work quota is found to be incorrect and the output is greatly increased by adopting rationalization proposals for production, the provisions of the work quota and piece-rate wage standards may be reviewed and revised earlier. However, the current work quota of workers who have proposed rationalization proposals for production shall not be reviewed and revised earlier."

Second is the issue of piece-rate wage stipulations. In Lüda, the piece-rate wage standard is 10% higher than the seven-grade wage standard. This is because workers make greater use of working hours after piece-rate. For example, the first-grade wage of the seven-grade wage system in Lüda is 2,400 yuan. Adding 10% (i.e., 240 yuan) to become 2,640 yuan is the monthly wage standard for piece-rate workers (see Table 2). When stipulating the unit price wage of a product, it is determined based on the nature and output of the product and the required working hours. For example, if repairing a lathe requires a seventh-grade worker and three sixth-grade workers to work for one day (eight hours), then the piece-rate wage for repairing this lathe is 1,137.1 yuan. Correct valuation is very important. If it is too low, workers will not receive the labor remuneration they deserve; if it is too high, it will not only affect costs, but also affect the emotions of other workers.

Progressive Rate 100 120 145 175 215 260 320

(Note: Calculated on the basis of 306 working days per year, 25.5 days per month, and 8 hours per day)

The piece-rate wage system is the most advanced and reasonable wage system. Therefore, its implementation must be coordinated with scientific factory management. In Soviet-operated and Sino-Soviet joint ventures, there are clear and specific production plans; and a detailed and scientific division of labor and responsibility is implemented. The responsibilities and relationships from the factory director, engineers, to the planning section, production technology section, financial accounting section, and wage labor organization section are very clearly and strictly defined. The enterprise's planning, summary system, production log system, meticulous and strict inspection system, and material receipt system are all well-organized and clearly defined. Only in this way can the piece-rate wage system be implemented easily. Of course, it does not mean that the piece-rate wage system can be implemented only after there is such a precise and accurate management system as in Lüda's industry, because it can be implemented in a variety of ways. For example, if it cannot be implemented in the entire factory, it can be implemented in some production units or workshops. If it cannot be implemented individually, it can be implemented collectively. If this product cannot be implemented, that product can be implemented. If it cannot be formally implemented, experiments can be carried out first. Only in this way will factory management gradually improve.

Only when you actually take a step can you learn to walk.

    按劳取酬的工资制度
    ——大连通讯之五（续完）
    本报记者  田流
    超额累进工资制另一个最大的好处是能推动工厂管理科学化。因为要想作到“超额”，首先必须有个“定额”和精密的编制（即“定员”），必须研究劳动力的组织，记载机械动率，进一步了解机器效能，这些工作反转来又直接帮助了生产计划和定员定额的正确性，而使生产管理日臻完善，逐渐达到合理化。
    应该实行超额奖励工资制度，应该奖励那些生产积极、超过任务、改进技术的模范劳动者。和其他任何事情一样，不奖励进步，就无法提高落后。
  三、计件工资制
    旅大地区已经实行并仍在大力推广的“计件工资制”，是在七级工资制的基础上，实行超额累进工资制后的一个继续发展。众多的经验证明，这是最先进的工资制度。苏联已有百分之八十以上的职工实行这种工资制度（见“苏联的经济工作方法”一书一一记者注），旅大公营企业至今年年底，也将有百分之七十工人实行计件工资。它的特点是能更高的发挥工人的积极性、创造性，更有效的利用机器和更好的组织劳动力。有人误解计件工资制就是通称的包工制，其实它和资产阶级的包工制有着根本的区别。这从下面几个有关计件工资的关键问题的处理上就可以看得很清楚。
    首先是“技术定额”问题，没有技术定额（华北称为“估工”）就不可能实行计件工资。旅大区的技术定额，是根据中等或多数工人的技术水平，或工人平均的技术水平（学徒除外）制定的。不是也不能以少数的熟练工人为标准，使一般工人望尘莫及，形成客观上限制工人进步。不是也不能以最低技术的工人为标准，那样虽对工人眼前“有利”，结果必致提高成本，使企业受到损失，也必然使工人受到损失。提高技术定额，是全体工人及工厂管理人员共同的责任，大多数工人技术提高，势必推动着技术定额的提高。因此技术定额确定之后，不宜常常变动，苏联是半年或一年变动一次，旅大是半年变动一次，并把它列入集体合同中，合同规定：“工作定额及计件工资标准之规定应不少于六个月，期满后，根据劳动组织合理化与技术装配之改进，得重新审查另定之。在发现工作定额确系错误及采取生产合理化建议而大大提高产量的情况下，得先期审查工作定额及计件工资标准之规定。但对提出生产合理化建议之工人现行工作定额，不得先期审查修正。”
    其次是计件工资之规定问题。在旅大是以七级工资的标准再加百分之十为计件工资标准的。这是因为计件后，工人对工时更高度的利用的原故，如七级工资制的一级工资在旅大是二、四○○元，加百分之十（即二四○元）成为二、六四○元后，即为计件工资工人每月工资标准（见表二），在规定产品的单价工资时，是根据产品性质、产量，所需的工时来规定的，如修理一台车床需要一个七级工人和三个六级工人工作一天（八小时），则这台车床修理时计件工资为一、一三七·一元。正确的估价是很重要的。如过低，工人将不能得到应得的劳动报酬；过高，不仅影响成本，还会影响其他工人的情绪。等级         1        2       3       4       5       6       7累进率      100      120     145     175     215     260     320
    每月   2640元   3168    3828    4620    5676    6864    8448
    工资  一  每日   103.5元  124.2   150.1   181.1   222.6   268.6   331.3级  工资  企  每时   12.9元   15.5    18.8    22.6    27.8    33.8    41.4业  工资  
    每月   2200     2640    3190    3850    4730    5720    7040
    工资二  每日   86.3     103.5   125.1   151.0   185.5   224.3   276.1级  工资企  每时   10.8     12.9    15.6    18.9    23.2    28.0    34.5业  工资   
    （注：每年按三○六个劳动日，每月按二五·五天，每天按八小时计算）
    计件工资制是最先进最合理的工资制度，因此在实行时必定要有科学的工厂管理来配合，在苏营及中苏合营企业里，都有明确的具体的生产计划；并实行着细致科学的分工负责制，从厂长工程师，到计划科、生产技术科、财务会计科以及工资劳动组织科等职责关系划分得十分清楚严格。企业上的计划、总结制，生产日录制，周密严格的检查制和领收材料制等，都井然有序，责任分明。只有这样才可能和便于实行计件工资制。当然不是说必须有了象旅大工业这样精密确切的管理制度后，才能实行计件工资制，因为它可有多种多样的实行法，比方不能全厂实行时，可在部分生产单位或车间实行，不能个人实行时，可集体实行，这种产品不能实行时，那种产品实行，不能正式实行时，可先进行试验。只有这样，工厂管理才会适应着逐渐健全起来。
    只有当你真正迈步的时候，才能学会走路。
