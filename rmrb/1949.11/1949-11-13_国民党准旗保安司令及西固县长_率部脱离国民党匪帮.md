Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, December 12th: An Ik ​​Zhao League dispatch reports: Qi Tianxiang, the Kuomintang Junqi Security Commander, announced on November 5th that he was leading his troops to break away from the Kuomintang bandit gang and join the People's Liberation Army. He also issued a circular telegram on the same day. The text of the telegram is as follows:

To Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, Chairman Yun of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government, Commander Wang of the Yimeng Military Region, Commanders Gao and Political Commissar Gao:

For more than thirty years, the Mongol ethnic group in our Junqi has been subjected to various oppressions, sabotage, and provocations by warlordism, Han chauvinism, and feudal ideology, resulting in the failure of the ethnic group to unite and develop. The Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is the current constitutional draft for the Chinese people. Chapter Six on ethnic policies fully reflects the spirit of unity and love among all ethnic groups in China, which is particularly exciting for the people of Inner Mongolia. Now, I, along with all 1,250 officers and soldiers, solemnly announce to the whole country: from this day on, we sever ties with the Kuomintang oppression and vow to join the People's Liberation Army, and strive forward under the leadership of Chairman Mao, Chairman Yun of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government, and the Communist Party. I respectfully report this to you and await instructions.

Qi Tianxiang, Former Junqi Security Commander, November 5th.

Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, December 12th: Sun Tiefeng, former Kuomintang County Magistrate of Xigu County in southern Gansu, Shen Ronghai, Speaker of the County Assembly, Li Chunsen, Secretary-General of the Kuomintang County Party Department, and Liu Kerren and Fang Cunyi, pseudo-National Assembly representatives, led more than 300 members of the county's Self-Defense Forces and police officers on the 10th to announce their departure from the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, and immediately sent representatives to the People's Liberation Army stationed in Min County, requesting the People's Liberation Army to quickly enter and station in the area.

Furthermore, Ma Chengxiang, former Speaker of the Qinghai Kuomintang Provincial Assembly and commander of the remaining Kuomintang bandit troops in Qinghai, led more than 120 of his remaining troops to surrender to the People's Liberation Army in Gonghe County, west of Xining, a few days ago, bringing with them three machine guns and ninety-one rifles and pistols.
