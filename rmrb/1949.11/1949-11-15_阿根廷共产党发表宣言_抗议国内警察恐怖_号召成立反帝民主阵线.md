Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 14th: TASS, Buenos Aires, November 13th: The Argentine Communist Party has issued a declaration protesting the wave of domestic police terror, which reached its peak with the recent arrest of approximately one thousand anti-fascists (referring to the Argentine reactionary authorities' arrest of masses celebrating the October Revolution in the capital on the 5th of this month). Among those arrested are Argentine Communist Party leaders Codovilla, Real, and Lared. The declaration states that the Argentine government, violating the interests of the people, is implementing an anti-Soviet policy to curry favor with American and British imperialists. The Argentine Communist Party calls for the immediate establishment of a National Anti-Imperialist Democratic Front to save the country from the economic disaster that imperialism is attempting to inflict upon Argentina. The Argentine Communist Party also demands the establishment of friendly relations with the Soviet Union, People's Democratic China, and other democratic countries.
