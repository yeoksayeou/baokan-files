Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, November 4th: The "Rent Reduction and Old Debt Settlement Measures" passed by the Chang'an County Farmers' Representative Conference and submitted to the Chang'an County People's Representatives Conference for discussion and approval are as follows:

　　I. All land leased by landlords, rich peasants, ancestral halls, temples, and churches, regardless of the form of tenancy, shall implement a "25% rent reduction." That is, for every stone of rent originally paid, 2.5 dou should be deducted. The reduced rent shall not exceed 37.5% of the normal yield. If it exceeds this, it should be further reduced. If it is lower than 37.5% of the yield, it should not be increased. The rent should be paid and collected according to the rent after the "25% rent reduction". The rent for dry land should not be collected according to the rent for paddy fields.

　　II. All old rents owed by farmers to landlords, rich peasants, ancestral halls, temples, and churches before liberation shall be waived.

　　III. The rent for public land, school land, temple land, and household land that has been seized or embezzled shall be recovered appropriately by the village government in consultation with the farmers' association. The seized land should be taken out and rented to landless or land-poor farmers by the farmers' association in consultation with the villagers of the same clan and village.

　　IV. Farmers' tenancy issues should be handled in the spirit of unity and mutual assistance, through mutual agreement and government mediation.

　　V. Rent shall be paid after the harvest. Advance collection of rent (such as current rent) is prohibited. The local standard weights and measures should be used for rent collection. The use of large bushels and large scales to collect rent is prohibited.

　　VI. The rights of tenants must be effectively protected. Landlords and rich peasants must not engage in false mortgages, false sales, land reclamation, or tenant eviction.

　　VII. After the rent reduction, old contracts should be withdrawn and new contracts should be drawn up. After the landlord collects rent according to the contract, the tenant should also pay rent according to the contract. Those who suffer reduced harvests due to floods or droughts this year must have their rents reduced or waived appropriately according to the severity of the disaster (the specific measures will be announced separately).

　　VIII. For old debts owed by farmers to landlords, usurers, and rich peasants before the establishment of the democratic government, interest shall be calculated and repaid at a monthly rate of 1.5% (calculated as simple interest). If the interest paid exceeds the principal by one time (i.e., if 100 yuan was borrowed and 100 yuan of interest has been repaid), interest payment should stop and only the principal should be repaid. If the interest paid exceeds the principal by two times (i.e., if 100 yuan was borrowed and 200 yuan of interest has been repaid), both principal and interest payments should stop. After the old debts are repaid, the land and property mortgaged for the debts should be returned to the farmers. Existing sales relationships should not be changed. Disputes over debts between farmers shall be mediated by the government and farmers' association. Debts owed by landlords and rich peasants to farmers should be repaid according to the contract and are not subject to these regulations.

　　IX. Silver rent land is essentially usury and should be abolished from now on. Past silver rent debts should be handled according to the above principles of debt settlement, i.e., if a landlord or rich peasant provides one stone of grain in lieu of silver, and the debtor has paid rent exceeding one stone, rent payment should stop and only the principal should be repaid. If the rent paid exceeds two stones, both principal and rent payments should stop. Mediation and handling between farmers, and debts owed by landlords and rich peasants to farmers should be repaid according to the contract.

　　X. Commercial debts for the purchase and sale of goods shall be handled by the people themselves and are not subject to old debt settlement.

　　XI. From now on, loan interest rates shall be freely agreed upon by both parties. The government shall guarantee that lenders receive legitimate interest and that loans are repaid. The above measures shall be implemented after being approved by the government.

　　长安各界人民代表会议通过
  　减租清理旧债办法
    【新华社西安四日电】长安县农民代表大会上通过提交长安县各界人民代表会议讨论通过的“减租清理旧债办法”如下：
    一、所有地主、富农户地及祠堂，庙宇，教会出租之土地，不论任何租佃形式，一律实行“二五减租”，即原来交租一石者，减去二斗五升，减后租额最高不能超过正产量千分之三百七十五；超过者再减。低于产量千分之三百七十五者不得增加，应按“二五减租”后之租额交收地租，出租旱地不得按水地租额收租。
    二、解放以前农民所欠地主、富农、祠堂、庙宇、教会之旧租一律免交。
    三、公地、学田、庙地、户地等被强占或贪污之租子，由乡村政府与农会协议酌量追还，被强占之土地应抽出，由本族本村农民与农会协商租给无地少地农民耕种。
    四、农民之租佃问题，本团结互助精神，双方协议政府调解处理。
    五、地租一律于产物收获后交纳，禁止预收地租（如现租）。收租应使用当地通用之斗秤，禁止大斗大秤收租。
    六、确实保障佃权；地主富农不得假典、假卖、倒地、夺佃。
    七、减租后应抽回旧约、另立新约。地主依约收租后，佃户亦应依约交租。今年遭水旱灾而致歉收者，须依其灾情轻重酌量减免（其办法另行公布）。
    八、民主政权建立前，农民所欠地主、高利贷者及富农之旧债，一律以月利一分半计息清偿（一律以单利计算），付息超过原本一倍者（即借本百元已还息一百元者），停息还本，付息超过原本二倍者（即借本百元已还息二百元者），本息停付。旧债清偿后，其抵押债务之土地、财产，应交还农民，已成买卖关系者不动。农民间相互之债务纠纷，由政府与农会协议调解之。地主富农所欠农民的债务，应照约清偿，不受此项规定所限。
    九、银租地实质是高利贷，今后应予取消。以往银租债利，根据上项清偿原则处理，即地主或富农出粮一石当入的银粮地，债户付租超过一石者，停租还本，付租超过二石者，本租停付。农民间的调解处理，地主、富农欠农民的依约清偿。
    十、凡货物卖买之商业赊欠之帐，由人民自行处理，不在清理旧债之列。
    十一、今后借贷利息，由人民双方自由约定，政府保障放债者得到正当利息，以及有借有还。以上各项办法经政府批准后执行之。
