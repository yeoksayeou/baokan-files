  　Northeast China Develops Sideline Production

  　8,000 Gold Panners in Fuxin Have Already Earned 2,000 Shi of Rice
    [Comprehensive Report] Under the leadership of governments at all levels and with the help of cooperative trade departments, farmers in various parts of Northeast China have universally launched sideline production in conjunction with the autumn harvest. Sideline production is an important source of income for farmers in Northeast China. For example, in western Liaoning, sideline production accounts for 30% to 50% of the total income of local farmers. Party committees and governments at all levels, based on local conditions, have put forward the slogan "relying on the mountains for a living, relying on the sea for a living." Economic and trade departments have universally launched purchasing work to solve the problem of sales for sideline products. For example, the Liaoxi Native Produce Company determined that during September, October, and November, it would focus on purchasing sideline products from rural areas such as hides, medicinal materials, and pig bristles. The Fuxin County branch of the Northeast Bank allocated 385 million yuan in loans to seven cooperatives, including Beizhen, enabling the cooperatives to expand their business scope. After receiving the loans, the cooperatives in orchard areas immediately mobilized farmers to weave pear baskets. In various forest areas of Jilin, logging committees have been established, with some district heads and secretaries personally serving as directors and members, responsible for unified leadership of logging work. Thanks to planned leadership and support, sideline production has been better developed. In Fuxin County, western Liaoning, 7,000 to 8,000 people participate in gold panning every day, and in less than 20 days, the income in grain has reached 2,000 shi. In Liaozhong County, two villages organized 327 reed cutting frames, with more than 1,600 people participating. They plan to cut 930,000 bundles of reeds, which can be exchanged for 1.2 million jin of sorghum. Other activities such as collecting firewood, fishing, weaving cattail bags, weaving mats, weaving baskets, burning ash, and collecting apricot kernels are also very common. In mountainous areas of Heilongjiang Province such as Nenjiang, Qing'an, and Dedu, production of mountain products, such as wood ear, hazelnuts, and mushrooms, has been launched. In Anda County, Heilongjiang Province, Yaoye Village, during the autumn harvest, extracted more than 80 male and female laborers to engage in sideline production, producing a total of more than 3,300 jin of alkali, 14,800 jin of salt, 27,000 jin of nitrate, and 32,000 jin of brine, as well as cutting reeds and firewood, with a total income of 88.52 million yuan (Northeast currency). Sideline production is also very common in counties such as Rehe, Qinglong, Beipiao, and Fengshou. In Beipiao, more than 1,800 people participated in eight districts, earning more than 100 shi of rice. Xiaoliangzi Village in Fengyin organized more than 30 ox carts for transportation and sales, and exchanged wooden carts for four large steers and two calves, as well as many farm tools. In Dalian County, Lüda, most areas immediately began sideline production such as cutting sea grass after the autumn harvest. Chagou District plans to cut 6 million jin, and 1.5 million jin have already been cut, which can buy 230,000 jin of grain. The county cooperative is preparing to help with sales. In addition, various types of sideline production have also been launched in various parts of Inner Mongolia. The Forestry Bureau and the county and district joint cooperatives, as well as village cooperatives, are also planning to help farmers with logging and purchasing local products. At present, various parts of Northeast China have entered large-scale winter sideline production.
