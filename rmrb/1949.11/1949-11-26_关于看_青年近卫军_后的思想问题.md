Thoughts After Watching "The Young Guard"
    Ya Qun

Comrades who have seen "The Young Guard" will undoubtedly express boundless admiration for the young heroes who sacrificed themselves for the motherland and the people. However, at the same time, might the following thoughts still be lurking within us?

    First, while such heroic sacrifice is indeed great, what if I were subjected to such inhuman torture? Could I remain heroically unyielding?
    Thus, without confidence, a question mark is planted in one's mind.

    Second, that's no fun. Forget about posing as a hero; it's better to be honest.
    Thus, one simply admits one's inability and comforts oneself with "honesty," with the so-called excuse of "I'm participating in construction work."

    Third, especially when subjected to criticism or other unsatisfactory situations, "Don't look down on me! Given the chance, I'll show you."
    Thus, one constantly fantasizes about having an opportunity to "prove" oneself and become "great" and "glorious."

All of these thoughts are incorrect. As for the first thought, the question cannot end with asking oneself, "Can I do it?" One should further think: How should we train and cultivate ourselves to strive to definitely be able to do it, and confidently believe that we can certainly do it? The second thought vulgarizes the honesty advocated by communists. This kind of honesty is, in reality, just another name for being unambitious. The honesty we advocate refers to the noble Bolshevik quality of holding infinite loyalty to the people and the cause of the Party. The kind of "honest" thought that initially affirms one's inability is harmful. To regard generously giving one's life when necessary for the motherland and the people as a matter of course; if a revolutionary youth does not affirm this point, he will drift in the ranks of the revolution, and the result will be that he goes down a very dangerous path. The third thought is truly not "honest." It regards the highest expression of infinite loyalty to the motherland and the people (sacrifice when necessary) as an ornament for obtaining personal fame and status. If this thought is not overcome, one is very likely to fail the test when actually facing one. We cannot strive for a test for the sake of a test.

Combining the above three thoughts, to sum up, although there are degrees of lightness and heaviness, the essence is the same: the consciousness of personal calculations is at play. We should clearly realize that the reason why the heroes of the Young Guard were able to possess this noble quality of a new humanity is mainly because they grew up in the process of constantly, for a long time, bit by bit, learning and working for the motherland and the people under the education and cultivation of the Bolshevik Party. It was definitely not brought about out of thin air, nor was it derived from fantasies divorced from the daily work of loyally serving the motherland and the people.

Why should we doubt our ability? Why do we disarm ourselves in will (thinking we can't do it) when we remotely imagine the cruelty of class enemies? We are living in an era of earth-shattering changes. Under the leadership and education of the Party, and through training in practical work, if we overcome personal consciousness, we will feel the solemnity of life. No force other than truth can subdue us. In the face of class enemies, we have only boundless anger and hatred. At the same time, we also feel that the motherland and the people of the world are watching our actions, and that our actions—heroic sacrifices—directly and indirectly affect the future of mankind. We will naturally generate unparalleled strength. We live solemnly for the motherland and the people, and we also die solemnly for the motherland and the people.

Today, in reason, we all know that we must love the motherland and love the people, but for this love to become a real feeling, we still need to devote our labor wholeheartedly to the motherland and the people for a long time (working diligently and conscientiously) in order to obtain and consolidate it. If we drift back and forth in the struggle to build the motherland, and are always making calculations for ourselves, it will never be possible to develop the flesh-and-blood connection between ourselves and the people of the motherland.

That we have produced the above three thoughts after watching "The Young Guard" is naturally wrong, but if we only take a critical approach and greatly praise and eulogize it, it is of no benefit. We—every Communist Party member, every Communist Youth League member—should combine our thoughts and feelings with those of the heroes of "The Young Guard," and love our motherland and people!

　　关于看“青年近卫军”后的思想问题
    亚群
    看过“青年近卫军”的青年同志们，没有问题，谁也会对那些为祖国为人民而牺牲的青年近卫军英雄们，表示无限崇敬的，可是，同时，是不是可能还潜存着如下的思想：
    第一、那种英勇的牺牲诚然是伟大的，但是，假如自己也在那种非人的严刑拷打之下，怎样呢？做不做得到英勇不屈呢？
    于是没有自信地在自己的脑子里打下一个疑问。
    第二、那不是好玩的，算了吧，不要冒充英雄，还是老实一点好些。
    于是干脆地承认自己做不到，并以“老实”安慰自己，而有所谓“我参加建设工作”的说法。
    第三、尤其是受着批评以及其他不如意的时候，“你们不要瞧不起我”，有机会瞧我也考验给你们看。”
    于是老是幻想着自己有机会那末考验一下就“伟大”“光荣”了。
    所有这些想法，都是不正确的。第一种想法，问题不能止于反问自己“做不做得到？”应当进一步想：我们要如何锻炼，修养，争取一定做到，而且肯定地相认自己一定能做到。第二种想法是把共产党人提倡的老实，庸俗化了。这种老实，实际上就是没出息的别名。我们所提倡的老实，就是指的对人民，对党的事业抱着无限忠诚的高贵的布尔塞维克的品质。象那种首先自己就肯定自己做不到的“老实”思想是有害的。为祖国，为人民，必要时慷慨地付出自己底生命，视为当然；一个革命青年，假如这一条都没有肯定，他将在革命的队伍中浮来浮去，结果是会走到很危险的路上去的。第三种想法，可真不“老实”，把对祖国对人民无限忠诚的最高峰的（必要时的牺牲）具体表现，看作博取个人名誉地位的装饰品，这种思想不克服掉，实际上真正面临考验的时候，是很可能经不起考验的。我们不能为考验而考验。
    综合以上的三种想法，归结起来，程度上虽有轻重之分，但实质上同是个人打算的意识在作怪则一。我们应当明确的认识到：青年近卫军的英雄们之所以能具备这种新的人类的高贵品质，主要的就是在布尔塞维克党的教育培养下，不断地，长期地，一点一滴地为祖国为人民而学习而工作的斗争过程中成长起来的，决不是凭空带来的，更不是离开了为祖国为人民而忠诚服务的日常工作的幻想中得来的。
    我们为什么要怀疑自己做不到？我们为什么遥想着阶级敌人的残暴便在意志上缴了械（认为自己做不到）？我们正生活在翻天覆地的大时代里，我们在党的领导和教育下，在实际工作的锻炼中，把个人意识克服掉，我们就会感到生的庄严，除了真理而外，什么力量也不能屈服我们。在阶级敌人面前，我们只有无限的忿怒和仇恨，同时我们也感到祖国以及全世界的人民都瞩目着我们这一行动，而我们这一行动——英勇的牺牲，直接间接影响到人类的前途，我们就会自然地产生无比的力量。我们为祖国为人民而庄严的生，也为祖国为人民而庄严的死。
    今天，在理性上，我们都知道要爱祖国要爱人民，但这爱要成为实感，则还须长期地全心全意为祖国为人民而付出自己的劳力（脚踏实地的工作）才能获得而且巩固。假如我们在建设祖国的斗争中荡来荡去，老是替自己打着算盘，就决不可能发生自己与祖国人民之间的血肉相联的感情。
    我们看了“青年近卫军”，产生上述的三种想法，自然是错的，但，如其我们仅是以鉴赏者的心情，大大地赞叹歌颂一番，也是没有什么益处的。我们——每个共产党员，青年团员，应当把自己的思想感情和“青年近卫军”的英雄们结合起来，热爱我们底祖国和人民！
