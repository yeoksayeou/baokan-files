    Remarkable Achievements of the Soviet Economy

The report published in Soviet newspapers on the completion of the Soviet national economic plan for the second quarter of 1949 is new documentary proof of the great achievements of the socialist economy.

These achievements are first evident in the fact that the Soviet government not only completed but exceeded the expanded industrial production plan in the second quarter. The national industrial gross output plan for the first half of 1949 was also fully exceeded.

If we compare this year with last year, the scale of achievements in the Soviet national economy is very significant. Steel, coal and oil, locomotives and rolling stock, automobiles and buses, tractors and combine harvesters, timber and paper, cement and glass, bicycles and radios, clocks and cameras, textiles and footwear, meat and fish, tea and cigarettes – the production of every item of Soviet industrial goods has greatly exceeded the output of the same quarter last year. The total output of Soviet industry in the second quarter of 1949 was 20 percent higher than in the same quarter of 1948.

An increase of 20 percent in industrial production in just one year! This rate of development of the people's economy is only possible under the socialist system.

Less than four years have passed since the end of World War II – the most brutal and difficult war in our history. In June 1949, the average daily total output of Soviet industry exceeded the average daily total output of the pre-war year of 1940 by 41 percent. The significance of this fact cannot be overestimated. Especially when we remember that the industry of the European capitalist countries least affected by the war has not only not increased, but on the contrary shows a clear trend of production shrinkage, the significance of this fact is even greater.

In the first year after the war, the Soviet people and government formulated a five-year plan for the restoration and development of the people's economy, aiming to complete industrial production in 1950 equivalent to 148 percent of pre-war production. At that time, bourgeois economists serving monopoly capital responded with skeptical ridicule. But after only three and a half years, Soviet industry has nearly reached the average daily production target set at the end of the five-year plan. This is the power of the Soviet socialist system. This is a remarkable result of the Stalinist policy of the Soviet government, and the result of the free and creative labor of all the Soviet people for the prosperity of their motherland.

The summary of the Soviet national economy for the first half of the year not only shows brilliant achievements in industry, but also in transportation and agriculture. The fact that the cultivated area this year has been expanded by 6 million hectares compared to last year indicates this. The expansion of the harvest area means an increase of millions of "poods" of grain, potatoes, vegetables, cotton, flax, ramie, sunflower and other food and industrial crops, and in particular predicts the great prospects for further development of this year's agricultural harvest. Because Stalin's plan to transform nature is being successfully carried out in the grasslands and forests, and at the same time, the progress of Soviet industry makes it possible to supply agriculture with more perfect tools. In the first half of 1949, the number of motorcycles, tractors, combine harvesters, threshers and other machines obtained in agriculture was 50 to 100 percent more than in the same period last year.

Under the Soviet system, it goes without saying that the progress of industry, transportation, and agriculture shows the improvement of the living standards of all working people. The improvement of the living standards of the Soviet people can be seen in the lives of the people in every region of the Soviet Union, and can be demonstrated by the continuous increase in the consumption of industrial products and food. Statistics for the second quarter of 1949 show that sales of food increased by 15 percent compared to the same period last year, while sales of general consumer goods increased by 27 percent. It is worth noting that sales of valuable foods such as meat and meat products, sweets and sugar have increased significantly. Sales of non-food items have also increased significantly, such as wool (87 percent) and silk (60 percent), radios, bicycles, motorcycles, and clocks.

The happiness of all the Soviet people, the individual happiness of each citizen, is closely linked to the prosperity and development of its national economy, and the achievements of socialist construction. These achievements are reflected in the increase in the output of goods, the improvement of quality and the increase in varieties, the reduction of production costs, the gradual increase in capital accumulation, the continuous improvement of workers' skills, and the great increase in labor productivity.

In capitalist countries, tens of thousands of experts cannot find opportunities to use their knowledge; in the Soviet Union, in the second quarter of 1949 alone, 390,000 young experts graduated from universities, technical colleges and other specialized schools. None of them are unemployed, or have their expertise buried. Everyone can use their talents in the construction of the national economy.

The same is true of workers. It is worth noting that in just one year (compared to the second quarter of 1948), the number of employees in national economic agencies increased by 1.6 million. The contrast between the increase in the labor force in the Soviet Union and the decline in employment in capitalist countries, and the unemployment and gradual impoverishment of millions of people in these countries, powerfully proves that the Soviet socialist system is far superior to the capitalist system of exploiters.

The Central Statistical Bureau of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union fully pointed this out in its report for the second quarter of 1949. These summary reports prove the steady rise of the Soviet national economy and the great achievements in improving the material and cultural life of the people. In the capitalist world, in the face of an increasingly pressing and cruel crisis, which has now plunged millions of people into hunger and many worse disasters – in this situation, the recent summary of the development of the Soviet national economy is particularly meaningful.

    苏维埃经济的卓越成就
    一九四九年第三十一期新时代社论
    发表在苏联报纸上的关于苏联国民经济计划一九四九年第二季完成的报告，是社会主义经济伟大成就的一个新的证明文献。
    这些成就首先从这个事实看出，即苏联政府在第二季中业已扩大了的工业生产计划，不仅完成而且是超过了。一九四九年前半年的国家工业总生产额计划也全部超过了。
    倘若以今年和去年比较，苏维埃国民经济方面的成就规模，是非常显著的。钢铁，煤和石油，机车和车辆，汽车和公共汽车，拖拉机和康拜因机，木材和纸张，洋灰和玻璃，自行车和无线电收音机，钟表和摄影机，织品和鞋着，肉和鱼，茶和纸烟——每一项苏联工业品的生产，都比去年同季的产量大大超过了。一九四九年第二季苏联工业的总生产额，比一九四八年的同季生产，高出百分之二十。
    仅仅一年之中，工业生产额就增加了百分之二十！这种人民经济发展的速度，只有在社会主义制度下才有可能。
    第二次世界大战——我国历史上所经历的最残酷的和最艰难的战争结束后，还不到四年。就在一九四九年的六月，苏联工业每日平均的总生产额，就较战前一九四○年时的平均每日总生产额超过了百分之四十一。这件事实的重大意义是绝没有过分估价的。特别当我们忆起，在战争中受害最小的欧洲资本主义国家的工业，不但产量未增，而相反的是显明的生产萎缩的趋势时，就更感到这事实意义之重大。
    在战后的第一年，苏联人民和政府制定了人民经济复兴与发展的五年计划，他们的目标要在一九五○年完成工业生产额的价值，要相当于战前生产额的百分之一百四十八。那时候，为独占资本服务的资产阶级经济学家曾报以怀疑的讥笑。但是仅仅经过了三年半的时间，苏联的工业，就已经近于在五年计划终了时预定达到的每日平均生产额。这就是苏维埃社会主义制度的力量。这就是苏联政府的斯大林政策的显著成果，是全苏人民为其祖国的富强所从事的自由的创造性劳动的成果。
    苏联国民经济前半年的总结，不仅在工业方面有辉煌的成就；而在运输业和农业方面也是如此。如今年较去年的耕地面积扩大了六百万公顷就指明了这点。收割区的扩大意味着数百万“生迪那”的谷物，马铃薯，蔬菜，棉花，亚麻，苎麻，向日葵和其它食物和工业作物的增加，而特别是预卜到今年的丰收农业的进一步发展的远景确实是伟大的呢。因为斯大林的改造自然计划，正在草原区及森林区成功的进行着，同时苏联工业的进步，使它有可能供给农业以更完善的工具。在一九四九年的上半年，农业上获得的摩托车、拖拉机、康拜因机，打谷机和其它机器，较去年同时期多百分之五十到百分之百。
    在苏维埃制度下，不消说，工业，运输以及农业的进步，是显示着全体劳动人民生活水平的提高。苏联人民生活水平的提高，可由苏联每一区域的人民生活中看出，并可由工业制品和食品消费的不断增加中表明。从一九四九年第二季统计数字中，说明出售的食品较去年同时期增多百分之十五；而一般的消费品售出额，则增加了百分之二十七。值得注意的是，肉和肉类制品，糖果和糖等一类贵重食品的售出额大大增加了。食品以外的物品的售出额也显著增加了如羊毛（百分之八十七）和丝（百分之六十）、无线电、自行车、摩托车及钟表等。
    苏联全体人民的幸福，每个公民个别的幸福，与其国民经济的繁荣和发展，及社会主义建设的成就密切地联系着。这些成就表现在物品的产额增加，质量改善和种类的增多，生产成本的降低，逐渐增长的资本积累，工人技术不断的改进，以及劳动生产力的巨大提高等方面上。
    在资本主义的国家里，成千成万的专家们，找不到他们的知识的使用机会；在苏联，一九四九年的第二季内，三十九万个年青专家毕业于大学、技术学院和其它专门学校。他们之中没有一个失业，或者专长被埋没。每一个人都能在国民经济建设中发挥才能。
    在工人中也是一样。值得注意的是，仅在一年之中（与一九四八年第二季相较）国民经济机关中的职工人数就增加到一百六十万人。苏联劳动力的增加和资本主义国家中的就业下降的对比，以及这些国家中数百万人民的失业与逐渐贫困，有力地证明了苏维埃社会主义制度，大大优越于剥削者的资本主义制度。
    苏联部长会议中央统计局，在其所发表的一九四九年第二季的报告中，充分地指出了此点。这些总结报告证明了苏联国民经济的稳步上升，和人民物质文化生活提高的巨大成就。在资本主义世界里，在惨酷的危机日益迫切的情况下，这一危机现在已使千百万人民陷于饥饿及更坏的许多灾害中——在这种情况下，最近的苏联国民经济发展的总结，尤其显得具有深刻的意义。
