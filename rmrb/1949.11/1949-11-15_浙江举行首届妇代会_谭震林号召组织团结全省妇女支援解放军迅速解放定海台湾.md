    Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, November 14th: The first Zhejiang Provincial Women's Congress, marking the great unity of ten million women, was held from the 8th to the 11th of this month. Over 300 representatives of women from ten special districts of the province, as well as factories, government organs, schools, and households in Hangzhou, attended the meeting. At the meeting, Tan Zhenlin of Zhejiang Province gave a report on the current situation, the guiding principles, and tasks of women's work. Zhang Deng, a representative to the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) who had returned from Beijing, reported on the Common Program of the CPPCC. Chen Xue Zhao, a representative from the cultural field, conveyed the resolutions of the Second Congress of the Women's International Democratic Federation.
    In his report, Tan Zhenlin pointed out that the current task of the women's movement in Zhejiang Province is to organize and unite all women to struggle for the realization of the Common Program adopted by the CPPCC. He said: Supporting the People's Liberation Army in swiftly liberating all of China, especially liberating Dinghai and Taiwan, is the primary task of the people of Zhejiang Province and also the primary task of the women of Taiwan Province. In rural areas, women should actively participate in suppressing bandits and defending themselves, opposing local bullies, reducing rent, implementing reasonable burdens, abolishing the reactionary Baojia system, and establishing their own people's political power. They should unite within the farmers' associations and farmers' self-defense forces and become a strong force in the struggle. They should also actively participate in winter production and practice economy to solve the difficulties in next year's production. In cities, women should strive to restore production and seek the development of some production. Female workers should actively participate in trade union work, work hard to reduce costs, save raw materials, and improve product quantity and quality, and strive to implement the policy of both labor and capital benefiting and taking into account both public and private interests.
    In accordance with the provisions of the Common Program of the CPPCC regarding women's rights, women should fight for their special interests. For example, based on the current situation, nurseries and midwifery and medical services should be gradually established in factories and government organs. At the same time, efforts should be made to gradually realize true equality between men and women and freedom of marriage. Finally, Tan Zhenlin emphasized that striving to participate in labor production, striving for economic equality, and getting rid of economic dependence are the main conditions for women to achieve true liberation.
    The meeting adopted the Charter of the Zhejiang Provincial Democratic Women's Federation, elected 35 formal executive committee members and 7 alternate executive committee members, and formally established the Zhejiang Provincial Democratic Women's Federation. Finally, all the representatives unanimously passed telegrams to the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Chairman Mao of the Central People's Government, Commander-in-Chief Zhu of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Cai Chang, Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, and the Asian Women's Representative Conference.
    In other news: The Zhejiang Provincial Democratic Women's Federation held its first executive committee meeting on the 12th, electing Wu Zhonglian and eight others as members of the Standing Committee of the Federation. At the same time, Liu Wei, a member of the Standing Committee of the Federation and professor at the National Art Academy, was elected as the representative of Zhejiang Province to attend the Asian Women's Representative Conference.

    谭震林号召组织团结全省妇女支援解放军迅速解放定海台湾
    【新华社杭州十四日电】标志着一千万妇女大团结的浙江省首届妇女代表会议，已于本月八日到十一日举行。出席的有该省十个专区及杭州市工厂、机关、学校、家庭妇女代表三百余人。会上，浙江省谭震林作了关于当前形势、妇女工作的方针和任务的报告，自京归来的人民政协代表张登报告了人民政协共同纲领，文化界代表陈学昭传达了国际民主妇联第二次代表大会的决议。谭震林在报告中指出：浙江省当前妇女运动的任务是把全体妇女组织和团结起来，为实现人民政协会议所通过的共同纲领而斗争。他说：支援人民解放军迅速解放全中国，特别是解放定海和台湾，是全浙省人民的首要任务，也是台省妇女的首要任务。在农村中妇女应该积极参加剿匪自卫、反对恶霸、减租、合理负担、废除反动的保甲制度和建立人民自己的政权等项工作，应该团结在农民协会、农民自卫队之内，成为战斗中一个坚强的力量；并积极参加冬季生产，实行节约，以解决明年生产中的困难。在城市中妇女应该为恢复生产并争取部分生产的发展而斗争。女工们应积极参加工会工作，为降低成本、节省原料、提高产品数量和质量，为贯彻劳资两利、公私兼顾的政策而努力工作。依据人民政协共同纲领关于妇女权利的规定，妇女们应该为她们的特殊利益而斗争。例如根据今天的情况，在工厂和机关内应该逐步地创办儿童保育事业和助产与医药事业；同时，应为男女的真正平等、婚姻自由的逐步实现而努力。最后谭震林强调指出：努力参加劳动生产，争取经济上的平等，摆脱经济上的依赖性，这就是妇女争取真正解放的主要条件。会议通过了浙江省民主妇女联合会章程，并选出正式执委三十五人，候补执委七人，正式成立了浙江省民主妇女联合会。最后全体代表一致通过致中共中央委员会、中央人民政府毛主席、中国人民解放军朱总司令、中华民主妇女联合会主席蔡畅、亚洲妇女代表会议等电文。
    另讯：浙江省民主妇联已于十二日召开首次执行委员会，选出吴仲廉等九人为该会常务委员会，同时选出该会常委、国立艺专教授刘苇为浙江省出席亚洲妇女代表会议的代表。
