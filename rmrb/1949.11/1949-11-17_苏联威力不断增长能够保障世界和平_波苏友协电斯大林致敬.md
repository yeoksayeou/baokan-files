　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 16th: The Polish News Agency, Warsaw, 14th, reported: The Third National Congress of the Polish-Soviet Friendship Association sent a telegram to Marshal Stalin on the 13th. The telegram stated: "On behalf of more than two million members of this association, we extend our warm and heartfelt brotherly greetings to you, and through you to the Soviet people, and wish you further brilliant achievements and victories. We remember that the heroic Soviet army enabled us and our motherland to become an independent country again. We realize that only because there is a victorious socialist country can the Polish people gain freedom and move towards the complete liberation of society. We realize that the great assistance and experience of the Soviet Union is the foundation of our country's economic, cultural, and social development; and only with the support of the Soviet Union can we guarantee the sovereignty of the People's Poland, guarantee that our borders will not be violated, and guarantee further brilliant prosperity. We are convinced that the ever-growing power of the Soviet Union can thwart the evil plans of warmongers and Tito's henchmen and can guarantee the democratic peace of all nations. We, the members of the Polish-Soviet Friendship Association, whether party members or non-party members, will resolutely consolidate and deepen the alliance and friendship between the Polish and Soviet peoples. We are deeply convinced that, based on the Soviet Union's experience and brilliant achievements, we will work for the prosperity of the people's motherland moving towards socialism, so as to serve our people and promote the consolidation of the camp of peace and progress. And the Soviet Union and you—the brilliant leader and mentor of the working masses of the world—are the vanguard of this camp."
