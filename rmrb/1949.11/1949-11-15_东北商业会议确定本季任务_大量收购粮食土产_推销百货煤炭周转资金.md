Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 14th. The Commercial Department of the Northeast People's Government convened a commercial conference in the middle of last month. More than 100 cadres from commercial departments, including directors and chiefs of commercial departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities, and directors of cooperatives, attended. Based on the specific guidelines and tasks for commerce stipulated in the "Northeast People's Government's Policy Guidelines," the conference summarized the commercial work of the past six months from March to August this year, formulated the commercial plan for the fourth quarter of this year, drafted a draft commercial plan for 1950, and discussed issues such as the combination of commerce and cooperatives. When summarizing the work of the past six months, Wang Xingrang, Minister of Commerce, pointed out: The commercial work in Northeast China has basically completed the task of selling a large amount of goods to recover currency. Affiliated units sold a total of 7 trillion yuan (Northeast currency, same below) worth of grain and other daily necessities and industrial raw materials, ensuring the supply needed by the people, stabilizing prices, and transporting 220,000 tons of grain to North China and Shanghai (including private merchants, a total of about 300,000 tons), supporting the national liberation war and economic construction. In industrial and mining areas, in accordance with the government's stipulated wage payment methods, a large number of daily necessities were sold to employees, and a total of more than 56 million wage coupons were recovered. Grain companies and native product companies in various places purchased 230,000 tons of grain, and native products and industrial raw materials with a total value of 230 billion yuan, increasing the purchasing power of the people and narrowing the price difference between industrial and agricultural products. Under the guideline of commerce serving industry, various units also promoted the sale of state-owned industrial products with a total value of 2.1 trillion yuan and supplied state-owned industrial raw materials with a total value of 370 billion yuan. However, due to the failure of commercial leading organs at all levels to specifically study the development of national military victories and the economic situation, the lack of a comprehensive understanding of market needs and production conditions, and the lack of in-depth inspection of the implementation of various plans at the lower levels, many shortcomings have arisen. First of all, there is a lack of planning in business operations. 30% to 50% of the yarn sold in the second quarter failed to be sold directly to consumers. At the same time, in the distribution of sales, due to little understanding of the needs of the people, supply fell short of demand. Secondly, the economic accounting system has not been thoroughly implemented. The leadership has not carried out specific organizational work on this. Various companies have not yet established a complete responsibility system, quota management, and cost accounting. In addition, phenomena such as commodity backlog and capital waste are also very serious.

    The conference, in accordance with the guidelines and tasks for commerce stipulated in the "Northeast People's Government's Policy Guidelines," studied the basic economic situation of Northeast China and the whole country in 1950, as well as the new changes in the purchasing power of the people in Northeast China. It formulated in detail the business plans for purchasing and selling grain, native products, general merchandise, and coal in the fourth quarter, and pointed out that the fourth quarter is the most important season for the year's commercial work. Buying grain and native products is the central task of the quarter, while promoting the sales of general merchandise and coal is an important link in turning over funds and ensuring the completion of the purchase task. Regarding the plan for 1950, the basic content has been put forward at the meeting, which particularly emphasizes that the spirit of commercial work as a link for developing industry and agriculture should be implemented. The conference also unanimously agreed on the issue of combining state-owned commerce and cooperatives. At present, the central task of combining commerce and cooperatives is to help rural supply and marketing cooperatives implement new policies through state-owned commercial activities, which should include the establishment of new cooperatives and the transformation and improvement of old cooperatives. The conference also conducted preliminary discussions on various business relationships between state-owned stores and cooperatives, and decided that one-third of the grain purchase tasks in various places from the fourth quarter of this year to the third quarter of next year should be purchased through rural supply and marketing cooperatives to increase the trade volume of state-owned commerce with cooperatives.

    东北商业会议确定本季任务
    大量收购粮食土产
    推销百货煤炭周转资金
    【新华社沈阳十四日电】东北人民政府商业部于上月中旬召开商业会议，到有各省、市商业厅、局长和合作社主任等商业部门的干部百余人。会议根据“东北人民政府施政方针”中所规定的商业方面的具体方针和任务，总结了今年三月至八月半年来的商业工作，制定了今年第四季度商业计划，草拟了一九五○年度商业计划草案，并讨论了商业与合作社结合等问题。商业部王兴让部长在总结半年来工作时指出：半年来东北商业工作，基本上完成了大量售货以争取货币回笼的任务。所属各单位共卖出粮食及其他人民生活必需品和工业原材料等总值七万亿元（东北币，下同），保证了人民需要的供应，平稳了物价，并以二十二万吨粮食运往华北及上海（如连组织私商在内，共约三十万吨），支援了全国解放战争及经济建设。在工矿区，按照政府规定的工薪支付办法，卖给职工大量的生活必需品，共收回工薪券五千六百余万份。各地粮食公司及土产公司收购了粮食二十三万吨，土产及工业原料总值两千三百亿元，增加了人民群众的购买力，缩小了工、农业产品的差价。在商业为工业服务的方针下，各单位并推售国营工业产品总值两万一千亿元，供给国营工业原料总值三千七百亿元。但是，由于各级商业领导机关，对于全国军事胜利和经济形势的发展未能具体研究，缺乏对市场需要和生产情况的全面了解，并很少深入下层检查各种计划的执行情况，以致产生了不少缺点。首先是在经营业务中缺乏计划性，第二季度中所销售的纱布，有百分之三十至五十未能直接卖给消费者；同时在售货分配上，由于很少了解人民群众需要的情况，以致供不应求。其次是未能贯彻实行经济核算制。领导上对此未进行具体组织工作。各公司尚未建立起完整的负责制、定额管理及成本核算。此外如商品积压及资金浪费现象亦甚严重。
    会议按照东北人民政府施政方针中所规定的商业方面的方针和任务，研究了一九五○年东北和全国经济的基本情况，以及东北人民购买力的新变化，较详细地制定了第四季度购买和销售粮食、土产、百货、煤炭的业务计划，并指出第四季度是全年商业工作最重要的季节，收买粮食和土产是该季度的中心任务，同时推销百货及煤炭是周转资金，保证完成收购任务的重要环节。关于一九五○年度的计划，会上已提出了基本内容，其中特别强调应该贯彻商业工作应作为发展工农业纽带的精神。会议对国营商业与合作社结合问题，亦一致认为目前商业与合作社结合的中心工作，是通过国营商业活动，帮助农村供销作社贯彻新方针，其中应包括建立新社、改造和提高旧社的工作。会议对国营商店与合作社间的各种业务关系也进行了初步讨论，并决定今年第四季度至明年第三季度各地购粮任务中应有三分之一的粮食通过农村供销作社购买，以增加国营商业对合作社的贸易额。
