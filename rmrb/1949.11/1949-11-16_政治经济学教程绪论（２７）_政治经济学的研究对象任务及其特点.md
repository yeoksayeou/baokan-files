    Section One: The Task and Significance of Political Economy

    After World War I, the Soviet Union, a socialist state, emerged. In economics, a socialist economy appeared. The world economy split into two opposing systems: the world capitalist economic system and the world socialist economic system. Lenin and Stalin, in the Soviet socialist revolution and construction, created socialist political and economic doctrines, enriched the broad political economy with new economic and scientific knowledge, and developed Marxist political economy.

    At the same time, with the victory of the Soviet socialist revolution, and under its influence and assistance, the proletarian revolutionary movements in various capitalist countries continued to develop, and the colonial and semi-colonial revolutionary movements expanded unprecedentedly. The establishment and development of proletarian parties (Communist Parties) in various countries, and their leadership of the colonial and semi-colonial people in their people's democratic liberation movements, made the analysis and critique of the economies of colonial and semi-colonial countries, and the grasp of the laws of economic movement in colonial and semi-colonial countries, of great necessity and significance in revolutionary practice, and significant achievements were obtained. During and after World War II, the world capitalist system was greatly weakened and nearing its final demise, due to the victory of the anti-fascist people's democratic forces of various countries, led by the Soviet Union, over the German, Italian, and Japanese fascist bandits. Not only did new democratic countries emerge in Eastern Europe, with the establishment and development of new democratic economies, and approaching the broad road to socialism, but also in the East, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, after more than twenty years of long and arduous struggle, new democratic people's liberation areas and new democratic economies were established and developed, and correct financial and economic theories and policies were established. In addition, in other colonial countries in the East, such as North Korea, Vietnam, and Indonesia, due to the leadership of the Communist Parties of various countries, national democratic struggles have achieved significant victories, and new democratic regimes and economies have been partially established and are developing daily. Precisely because of these reasons, today we are even more equipped with sufficient conditions for building a broad political economy and have a greater necessity for establishing this broad political economy. Thus making it possible and conditional to realize the distant ideals of Marx and Engels eighty years ago.

    Critique of Bogdanov's View on the Object of Economic Research

    As mentioned above, the broad political economy studies the different economic movement laws of human society in various historical eras, and its purpose is to elucidate the special laws of socio-economic changes and developments in different eras. But the revisionist Bogdanov deliberately distorted this, abstracting the object of political economy research, and arguing that "the scope of economic science or economics research is the social labor relations between people." (See Shi Cuntong's translation of "Outline of Economic Science, Introduction" Section 1). He regarded the abstract labor relations between people as the basic structure of society, therefore believing that economics "may as well be called the science of studying the basic structure of society" (ibid.). According to his view, political economy is not a science that studies the different social relations of production in various historical eras, but a study of those abstract common things of human society. Therefore, from this point of view, Bogdanov could not see the concrete, essential, and fundamental differences between the various stages of socio-economic development in history. He only acknowledged that they "have some differences between them," and believed that "there is no clear dividing line between the former change and the latter change" (ibid., Section 3); he could not distinguish the different stages of socio-economic development from the anatomical analysis of the characteristics of various concrete relations of production and modes of production in human social history, but could only divide eras from certain phenomena of exchange and distribution and certain forms of social organization, and believed that "the path of these social developments is the same in its main points... and develops in fundamentally the same way" (ibid.). From this abstract point of view, Bogdanov fell into the quagmire of bourgeois metaphysics in methodology. He did not recognize the dialectical laws of socio-economic development from quantitative change to qualitative change, from gradual change to sudden change, and believed that: "The social relations of production and distribution change gradually and continuously, and there are no drastic transformations" (ibid.); thus, he could not see that socio-economics has its own laws of motion, and that each era has its own special laws of economic motion. Therefore, he did not acknowledge that economics is the science of studying the laws of economic motion, but on the contrary, mistakenly proceeded from phenomena, and confined himself to the observation and understanding of phenomena, believing that a science is only a "systematic understanding of a certain range of phenomena experienced by mankind" (ibid., Section 1).

  　政治经济学的研究对象任务及其特点
    王学文
  　第三章　政治经济学的任务意义与中国革命
    第一节　政治经济学的任务与意义
    第一次世界大战以后，出现了苏联社会主义的国家，在经济上出现了社会主义的经济，世界经济分裂为对立的两大体系——世界资本主义经济体系与世界社会主义经济体系，列宁和斯大林在苏联社会主义革命与建设中，创造了社会主义政治经济学说，以新的经济科学知识丰富了广义的政治经济学，发展了马克思主义政治经济学。
    同时，随着苏联社会主义革命的胜利，在它的影响帮助下，各个资本主义国家内，无产阶级的革命运动不断的发展，殖民地半殖民地革命运动空前的扩大，各国无产阶级政党（共产党）的建立与发展，并领导殖民地半殖民地的人民进行了人民民主的解放运动，因此，分析批判殖民地半殖民地的经济，掌握殖民地与半殖民地经济运动的规律，在革命实践中也就有了重大的必要和意义，并获得了显著的成绩。第二次世界大战期间与以后的时期，由于以苏联为主的各国反法西斯的人民民主力量战胜了德意日法西斯强盗，世界资本主义体系大为削弱，濒于最后衰亡的境地，不仅在东欧出现了新民主主义的国家，与新民主主义的经济的建立与发展，并迈近了向社会主义过渡的大路。而且在东方，在以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党领导下，经二十余年来长期艰苦的斗争，建立与发展了新民主主义的人民解放区，与新民主主义的经济，并树立了正确的财经理论与财经政策。此外在东方其他殖民地国家中，如北朝鲜、越南、印尼等，也由于各国共产党的领导，民族民主斗争获得了重大的胜利，部分地建立了新民主主义的政权与经济，并日益发展着。正由于这些原因，所以到了今天，使我们更具备了建设广义的政治经济学的充分条件并且更有着建立这种广义政治经济学的必要了。从而使马克思与恩格斯八十年前远大的理想，得有实现的可能与条件。
    对波格达诺夫关于经济学研究对象的批判
    既如上述，广义的政治经济学是研究历史上人类社会各个时代不同的经济运动规律的，其目的在于阐发各时代不同的社会经济变化发展的特殊规律。但修正主义者波格达诺夫却故意加以歪曲，他把政治经济学研究的对象抽象化，认为“经济科学或经济学底研究范围，就是人与人底社会的劳动关系”。（见施存统译“经济科学大纲序论”第一节），他把抽象的人与人间的劳动关系当做社会底基础构造，因此认为经济学“不妨叫它为研究社会底基础构造的科学”（同上）。依照他的这种说法，政治经济学不是研究历史上各时代不同的社会生产关系的科学，而是研究那些人类社会抽象的共同的东西的。因此，从这种观点出发，波格达诺夫就看不到历史上社会经济发展各阶段间具体的本质上根本不同的区别，他只承认他们“彼此间有若干差异”，而认为“前一个变化与后一个变化亦没有明确的分界线”（同上第三节）；他不能从人类社会历史上各种具体的生产关系，生产方式底特点的解剖分析出发，来分别区划社会经济发展的各个不同的阶段，而只能从交换与分配的某些现象和社会组织的某些形式出发来划分时代，并认为“这些社会发展的经路，在它的主要点上是一样的……在根本点上是同样发展起来的。”（同上）从这种抽象观点出发，波格达诺夫在方法论上陷入了资产阶级形而上学的泥沼，他不承认社会经济发展的辩证法的由量变到质变，由渐变到突变的运动规律，认为：“生产及分配底社会关系，逐渐地继续地变化着，急激的转变是没有的”（同上）；从而他也就看不到社会经济有着它自身的运动规律存在，各时代又有着各时代经济运动的特殊规律存在，因此他也就不承认经济学就是研究经济运动规律的科学，而相反地错误地从现象出发，并局限于现象的观察了解，认为凡是一种科学只是一种“对于人类所经验的一定范围内的现象之有系统的理解”（同上第一节）。
