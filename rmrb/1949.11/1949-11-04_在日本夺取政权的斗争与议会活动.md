　　I. Domestic and International Situations Make Seizing Power the Central Task

　　The Chains of World Capitalism Have Been Severed

　　After World War II, the fact that the general crisis of world capitalism has reached an extremely acute stage needs no further elaboration here. For example, the leap forward in socialist construction in the Soviet Union, the strengthening and development of people's democracy in Eastern Europe, the great victory of the Chinese Communist Party, the liberation of old colonies in the East, the ongoing economic crisis in capitalist countries, and the people's shift to the left are all proofs of this fact. In particular, the new events taking place in China have dealt a fatal blow to world capitalism. As an American reporter wrote: If the Chinese Communist Party rules over 450 million people, nearly half of the world's total population, and they become people under the communist regime, this is a major epoch-making event in world history, and the world will rapidly undergo fundamental changes. This is the collapse of capitalism, and the continuous establishment of people's regimes under the leadership of the Communist Party in various parts of the world.

　　From the perspective of the history of world development, it is clear that the conditions for the working people to seize power are currently maturing.

　　Japanese Capitalism is Also on the Verge of Collapse

　　So, let's take a look at the domestic situation in Japan.

　　Due to the great destruction of the war and the government's inflation and foreign dependency policies over the past three and a half years, the Japanese capitalist economy has been fundamentally subverted, and while losing its autonomy, the crisis is deepening day by day. Especially the recent crisis of world capitalism has further reduced foreign aid to the Japanese economy compared to the past, thus further promoting the deepening of the Japanese crisis, and the methods adopted by the ruling class in the past cannot open up the crisis. Here, they seem to see the way to open up the crisis as participating in fascist groups and the world war system.

　　One of the manifestations of this is the establishment of the reactionary Yoshida Cabinet, which in fact tramples on the democratic clauses of the new constitution and forcibly implements the nine economic principles in a reactionary manner. The essence of this policy means strengthening the political and economic dictatorship of a minority of monopoly capital, which can only be realized by sacrificing the interests of the majority of the people.

　　However, the ruling class's attempt to implement this policy will be met with fierce resistance from the people across the country. The history of the past three and a half years shows that they cannot achieve their goal. On the contrary, the result will intensify the crisis. Why? Because the people of today are not the people of five years ago. The working class leading them forward has millions of organized forces, has the experience of heroic struggles, and the strength of the Communist Party, the vanguard of the working class, has grown by leaps and bounds. The peasants and small and medium-sized business owners have begun to decline rapidly due to taxes, other forms of exploitation, and the concentration of production, and are moving towards the left. Even industrial capitalists have become victims of government policies and are also heading towards collapse. This means that the broadest masses of the people are moving in the direction of opposing monopoly capital.

　　Such an increase in the people's political consciousness and such powerful forces are a major event in Japanese history. It shows that the conditions for the collapse of Japanese capitalism are maturing day by day.

　　At the same time, the bankruptcy of the Yoshida Cabinet's policies is imminent. The six coups that have occurred in the short period since the war prove that Japan is currently in a political crisis, and it is clear that the policies of the six governments supported by big capital in the past cannot solve this crisis. Therefore, only through a people's government that implements people's policies centered on the nationalization of financial institutions and important industries and managed by the people can this crisis be opened up. And only a new government centered on the Communist Party and based on a broad democratic national united front can implement these policies.

　　In short, Japan's ruling structure is on the verge of bankruptcy, and the people's grievances and fighting spirit are rising. Three million people voted for the Communist Party, and the people's struggle to seize power has been put on the agenda. Only opportunists or social democrats cannot see this fact.

　　However, the following question is often raised at this time: Japan is currently under occupation, so can a people's regime be established?

　　We answer with confidence: "Possible!"

　　Then, does putting the people's struggle to seize power on the agenda mean that the objective and subjective conditions for establishing a people's government immediately are already mature?

　　No, this situation does not yet exist. Rather, the current stage is a period of preparation for rapidly creating such conditions.

　　II. What is the Struggle for Power

　　Concentrate All Struggles on Seizing Power

　　Under the current domestic and international situation, the central task of revolutionary workers is to unify and concentrate all activities on the struggle to seize power.

　　However, regrettably, communists often easily forget this basic principle, or at least there are regrettable phenomena of non-implementation in practice. For example, when organizing a strike in a factory, they do not pay attention to combining it with the struggle for power, but only pursue the success or failure of the strike. This is economism, and this tendency must be overcome.

　　Today, it is impossible to solve any struggle without destroying the central or local government. This is the characteristic of the recent situation. For example, lowering workers' wages and layoffs are policies forcibly implemented by the government; the current purchase of grain from farmers is also a government policy; the decline of small and medium-sized enterprises is also the result of the government's implementation of production concentration and heavy taxes; the housewives' troubles in the kitchen are all the result of poor politics. In this sense, it also shows that the economic struggle is inevitably combined with the struggle for power. Therefore, all the people's activities must be concentrated on the struggle to seize power. This point must be constantly kept in mind, and it is necessary to conduct daily activities with such foresight to guide them.

　　Weakening the Power of the Rulers

　　So, what exactly should be done in the struggle to seize power? For example, in which direction should we advance when leading an economic struggle?

　　First, all activities should be used to weaken the power of the ruling class and make it available to the people.

　　In this case, the so-called power means all power organs from the village police station and village government to the cabinet and the emperor.

　　Secondly, the methods of struggle include all mass actions and propaganda and education activities from strikes and demonstrations to elections and parliamentary activities.

　　Let me give an example!

　　For example, a strike should not only improve the workers' lives, but also infringe on the capitalists' profits, and must be organized to cause a "small crisis in capitalist society" (Lenin).

　　The appropriate revision of the tax system should not only reduce unreasonable taxation, but also criticize the country's finances.

　　We must use the exposure of unfair property transactions to prevent the ruling class from plundering and expand the contradictions between them.

　　Struggling with reactionary groups is to eliminate the running dogs of the ruling class.

　　Struggling with reactionary ideas is to overthrow the ideological pillars of the ruling class.

　　Participating in central and local election campaigns is to obtain as many seats as possible in the parliament and shake the base of the Conservative Party and its government.

　　From the above examples, it can be seen that all daily struggles have the effect of weakening the enemy's regime, and must be led and organized in this way. Therefore, even if each struggle suffers setbacks, it can still be said to be a victory as long as it weakens the enemy's strength by a few points.

　　Grasping Power and Developing Administrative Ability

　　Secondly, the content of the struggle to seize power is not only to weaken the enemy's camp, but also to expand and consolidate our own camp, especially the Communist Party as the guiding department, and at the same time prepare for administrative ability after seizing power. We must carry out all activities for this purpose.

　　For this reason, the Party and all Party members need to be tempered ideologically and theoretically. There are many petty-bourgeois ideas within the Party, both those who are attached to theory and those who despise theory and do not understand theory. If the Party is to truly become the revolutionary vanguard, it must consolidate the Party with revolutionary proletarian ideology and arm the Party with Marxism-Leninism theory. Without this weapon, it is impossible to defeat the enemy, nor can it seize and maintain power. These things must be learned in daily struggles and study sessions.

　　At the same time as the above things, in order to guide the broad masses and mass organizations outside the Party to move in the revolutionary direction, it is more important than anything else to actively carry out revolutionary propaganda and education to the masses in daily struggles.

　　Secondly, in order to defeat the enemy, it is necessary to strengthen the organization of our own camp, that is, to expand and strengthen the class fighting force.

　　The Communist Party, as the vanguard, must receive training suitable for its tasks, and must have iron discipline. Regarding this point, today's Party organization is by no means something to be satisfied with. First of all, there are few Party members. The election vote of three million people, the Party has only absorbed one-twentieth of the Party members, and the work style and discipline of the Party members are not necessarily good.

　　At the same time, the connection between the Party and the masses cannot be said to be close, and there is still much to be improved in this regard. And the mass organizations outside the Party are not powerful enough to play a major role in the class struggle. Especially the peasant and small and medium-sized business owners' groups are like this.

　　As mentioned above, it is important to strengthen and expand the organization of the Party and mass organizations in daily work.

　　Although we have been emphasizing defeating the enemy's regime until now, the power to carry out political work after seizing power should be cultivated in daily struggles, and must be emphasized today. The so-called struggle to seize power is not only to overthrow the current regime, but also for the people to seize power, maintain power, and implement new politics well. We must prepare for this work in the future.

　　For this reason, the Communist Party must first systematically investigate and study the important policies that a people's government should have, and be ready to seize the world at any time. At the same time, the Party and Party members must strengthen the administrative ability to implement these policies. We must defeat the slander of some bourgeois politicians who say that "the Communist Party can only destroy, but has no ability to build a regime" in practice.

　　The above-mentioned policies and administrative capabilities can be cultivated in daily Party activities and mass struggles. For example, in the struggle for village power and parliament, we often put forward the Communist Party's policies to the bourgeois parties. Moreover, in the daily activities of the Party and mass organizations, making them gain many benefits and results, or the exemplary behavior of the regime under the guidance of the Communist Party, can cultivate and establish administrative ability.

　　Winning Over the Masses

　　The third content of the struggle to seize power is to seize the masses under the influence of the enemy from the enemy's hands, participate in the democratic united front, and strengthen and consolidate the connection between the leader—the Communist Party—and the masses.

　　When the Conservative Party's reactionary forces can still grasp power, whether they use deception and intimidation, or are floating and impractical, they still have a broad mass base of support. If they lose the support of the masses, it is when their regime is extinguished. Therefore, the struggle for power is ultimately a struggle between the ruling class and us for the masses. The methods include all economic, political, and ideological activities. Its organizational form is expanded from the united front of trade unions to the democratic national united front.

　　Here, the so-called winning over the masses means the consolidated connection between the Communist Party and the masses, and making the masses willing to carry out activities under the leadership of the Communist Party. That is to say, the Communist Party has the highest prestige among the masses and establishes the Party's leadership over them.

　　How can the Communist Party win over the masses? The first step is for the Party to lead the struggle to implement the current demands of the masses. However, if we only stop at this point, the masses will not be able to deeply understand the essence of the Communist Party, so they will not be able to support the Party persistently and firmly. In order to closely unite them, their minds and thoughts must undergo a revolutionary change. The masses do not naturally become revolutionary in the economic struggle. The Party needs to actively carry out communist political propaganda and education among the masses, and the masses' thoughts will change, and then they will become active supporters of the Communist Party.

　　III. Parliamentary Struggle

　　The Fundamental Attitude of Parliamentary Struggle

　　Under extreme illegality, the Russian Communist Party before the October Revolution and the Japanese Communist Party before the war could only carry out propaganda and agitation for parliamentary elections and parliamentary activities, using legal work to cover up illegal revolutionary movements, and could only play an auxiliary role. At that time, higher requirements were impossible.

　　However, today's Japan has changed greatly.

　　Due to the efforts of domestic and international democratic forces, although after twists and turns, political freedom has been obtained, and the National Assembly has not become an appendage of the Tenno system. Constitutionally, it has become the "highest organ of state power." Secondly, the people's political consciousness has also rapidly increased. Due to the above changes, it is possible to use elections to send a majority of parliamentarians into parliament, and it is also possible to approach power through parliament. It is also possible for the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and other democratic forces to establish a coalition government. Therefore, the Communist Party's attitude towards the parliament needs to be changed.

　　At the current stage, the parliament is no longer a simple propaganda and agitation organ, but a (not the only) organ that can play a major role in obtaining power. At the very least, it can also prevent and destroy the implementation of the reactionary policies of the ruling class, or weaken the enemy's camp. In this way, activities to weaken the enemy's regime can be effectively carried out in the parliament. The above is the Communist Party's fundamental view of the post-war parliament.

　　Combination with Struggles Outside Parliament

　　But we are different from social democrats. Even if the working-class representatives occupy the majority in the parliament, we will not really imagine that the ruling class will meekly hand over power to the people without any resistance, and we do not think that all problems can be solved in the parliament. Why? Because the power of the ruling class is not only in the parliament, but also in the bureaucratic institutions centered on the police they mentioned, in the rural reactionary organizations, in the economic monopoly organizations, and in the press organs. They use all privileges outside the parliament to strive to maintain their power and eliminate the revolutionary forces. Therefore, if our struggle is limited to the parliament, that is exactly what the ruling class wants most, and the people will never grasp power. Therefore, while struggling within the parliament, it is absolutely necessary to strengthen the organization of all kinds of mass actions outside the parliament in order to democratize, weaken, and even eliminate these political, economic, and ideological ruling institutions.

　　Secondly, in order to effectively carry out activities within the parliament, it must be combined with the mass struggles outside the parliament. More strictly speaking, the struggle within the parliament can only be effective on the basis of the strength and struggle of the masses outside the parliament. Parliamentary struggle that is separated from the mass movement outside the parliament is powerless. On the contrary, past achievements indicate that when the struggle is carried out in the parliament based on the demands and struggles of the masses and combined with them, the Communist Party, although it has 35 parliamentarians, can exert ten times its strength. Moreover, the main reason for the Communist Party's progress in the recent general election lies in the fact that the Party often actively carries out daily activities outside the parliament.

　　In short, the activities within the parliament are the reflection of the mass struggle outside the parliament and the harvest of the results of the struggle. The Communist Party puts its main force in the struggle outside the parliament, and at the same time combines it with the struggle within the parliament, and unifies the inside and outside of the parliament to advance all struggles. This is fundamentally different from social democracy.

　　Main Tasks

　　Based on the above attitude towards the parliament, what are the Communist Party's basic tasks for the current parliament? The main ones are as follows:

　　To expose the Japanese monopoly capital's anti-people and anti-democratic policies, prevent and crush its compulsory implementation, cause the reactionary government and its parties to shake and split internally, and promote its disintegration.

　　At the same time, the Communist Party stands at the forefront of upholding democracy and independence, and launches active and concrete struggles to defend the lives of the masses. During this period, it is very important for the Party to constantly publish people's constructive policies so that the masses have a correct understanding of the Party.

　　The activities and methods within the parliament are basically for the purpose of coordinating with the mass struggle outside the parliament as mentioned above. This not only means reflecting the struggle outside the parliament into the parliament, but on the contrary, bringing the problems within the parliament to the masses outside the parliament, causing internal and external responses to each other.

　　It is also an important issue to form a common front with the Socialist Party, the Labor-Peasant Party, and other democratic forces in the parliament on common issues. The Yoshida Cabinet's policies of a minority of monopoly capital have aroused dissatisfaction and resistance from the broad masses. Therefore, it is possible to cooperate with the elements within the Conservative Party who represent small and medium-sized business owners on various issues. Secondly, reflecting the common front within the parliament to the outside of the parliament can promote the unity of mass organizations outside the parliament.

　　The parliament is a school for political education and training for the Party and Party members, and it must be done in this way. If you participate in the parliament, whether you want to or not, you will face the enemy head-on. Then you have to study the enemy's policies and tactics, and at the same time come up with the Communist Party's policies and oppose them to carry out the struggle. This requires learning revolutionary political tactics. Moreover, in order to prevent being contaminated by the bourgeois habits in the parliament, it is necessary to carry out Bolshevik self-cultivation. Otherwise, it will inevitably deviate from the Party's line.

　　About the Struggle of Communist Parliamentarians

　　The Communist Party's leap forward in the elections has caused a huge threat to the ruling class, but it has given the masses of the people bright hope. The people have great expectations for the Communist Party's struggle in the parliament. And the Communist Party is indeed in accordance with the people's expectations, and at the same time believes that the responsibility of the Party and the parliamentarians is very important. We cannot violate the wishes of the masses, and we must carry out the struggle in accordance with the wishes of the masses and achieve results. Regarding this point, I would like to put forward the following points:

　　The Communist Party is different from other political parties. The Party is the main body, and the parliamentarians are subordinate. Therefore, the important policies and tactics within the parliament are first determined by the Party's leadership, and the struggle within the parliament by the parliamentary group is unified and guided according to this decision. In terms of organizational scope, the parliamentary group is subordinate to the Party Central Committee (and the Political Bureau), and the actions and discipline of the parliamentarians are no different from those of ordinary Party members. This is the characteristic of the Communist Party's parliamentary group.

　　The parliament of capitalist countries has sufficient factors to corrupt and degenerate the worker parliamentarians. For example, the state gives parliamentarians high salaries that are very different from those of ordinary workers, and gives them various privileges that ordinary people do not have, so that the parliamentarians are separated from the environment of workers' lives, are "busy with state affairs", cannot carry out workers' daily struggles and trade union movements, and do not participate in the life of the Party, becoming special figures of the Party. The improper work style and atmosphere in the parliament can make the parliamentarians a lazy, stupid, and degenerate person. Secondly, the bourgeois news gives the parliamentarians praise and exaggeration, and the capitalists extend the hand of temptation. If they participate in the regime, the temptation is even more severe. The parliament has the effect of bourgeoisizing the worker parliamentarians in both material and spiritual aspects. Communist parliamentarians cannot be free from this influence.

　　For this reason, Communist parliamentarians should adopt methods that prevent each parliamentarian from leaving the mass struggle and the life of the Party, and at the same time take the obligation of living a normal Party life and having Bolshevik self-cultivation as the obligation of each parliamentarian.

　　在日本夺取政权的斗争与议会活动
    野坂参三（冈野进）著  杨正译
　　一，国内外形势使夺取政权成为中心课题
    世界资本主义的锁链已被切断了
    第二次世界大战后，关于世界资本主义一般危机已达到非常尖锐化的事实，在这里无需乎再详述了。譬如苏联社会主义建设的跃进、东欧人民民主主义的加强与发展、中国共产党的伟大胜利、东方旧殖民地的解放、资本主义各国经济危机的进行与人民的左倾等等，就是事实的证明。特别是在中国发生的新事件，给予世界资本主义以致命的打击。正如某美国记者所写的：如果中国共产党统治了四亿五千万人口，世界总人口的将近二分之一，就成为共产党政权下的人民，这是世界史上划时期的重大事件，世界将迅速地起着根本的变化。这就是资本主义的崩溃，与共产党领导下的人民政权，不断地在世界各地建立起来。
    从世界发展的历史来看，很明显的，劳动人民掌握政权的条件目前正在成熟中。
    日本资本主义也濒于崩溃
    那么，就来看看日本国内的形势吧。
    由于战争的大破坏以及三年半来政府的通货膨胀与对外依存政策，日本资本主义经济，从根基上被颠覆了，并与失去自主力同时，危机正日益加深。尤其是最近世界资本主义的危机，使外国对日本经济的援助，比过去更加减少，因此更促进日本危机的深刻化，而统治阶级从来所采用的方法，是不可能将危机打开的。在这里，他们似乎看出打开危机的途径，就是参加法西斯集团与世界战争体系。
    其中表现之一，就是反动吉田内阁的成立，它事实上蹂躏了新宪法的民主条款，用反动的方法强制实行经济九原则。这个政策的本质，就是意味着加强少数独占资本之政治的和经济的独裁，只有牺牲大多数人民的利益才能使它实现。
    但是，统治阶级要实现这种政策，会遭到全国人民猛烈的反抗。过去三年半的历史，说明了他们不可能达到目的，相反的，其结果将使危机激化。为什么？因为今天的人民不是五年前的人民。领导他们前进的工人阶级，有了数百万有组织的力量，有了英勇斗争的经验，成为工人阶级先锋队的共产党的力量，飞跃地壮大起来，农民以及中小业主，因为捐税、其他的剥削和生产的集中而开始迅速没落，并趋向左倾，连产业资本家也成为政府政策的牺牲者，同样走向崩溃的道路。这就是说，最广泛的人民大众，正向着反对独占资本的方向前进。
    人民政治觉悟如此提高，力量如此强大，是日本有史以来的一件大事。显示出日本资本主义崩溃的条件正在日益成熟中。
    同时，吉田内阁政策的破产，正迫在眉睫。战后短短期间共发生了六次政变，其本身证明了日本现时正处在政治危机当中，而且，过去六次为大资本所拥护的政府的政策，很明显是不可能解决这个危机的。因此，只有通过人民政府，执行以金融机关及重要产业国营并由人民管理为中心的人民的政策，才可能打开这个危机，而且要以共产党为中心、以广泛的民主民族战线为基础的新政府，才能实施这些政策。
    总之，日本的统治机构濒于破产，而人民间的不平不满与斗争情绪，正在高涨着。三百万人投了共产党的票，夺取政权的人民斗争，已提到日程之上。看不见这样事实的人，只有是机会主义者，或者是社会民主主义者。
    但是，在这时经常会提出如下的质问：日本目前处在占领的情况下，人民政权，究竟能否建立起来呢？
    我们有信心地答复：“可能的！”
    那么，夺取政权的人民斗争提到日程之上，是不是就是说立即建立人民政府的客观与主观条件已经成熟了呢？
    不，这种情况还不存在，毋宁说现阶段是迅速创造这种条件的准备时期。
　　二，什么叫做政权斗争
    把一切斗争集中于夺取政权
    在目前国内外情势下，革命工人的当前中心任务，就是把一切活动，统一与集中于夺取政权的斗争。
    但是，很遗憾，共产主义者常常容易忘却这个基本原则，至少在实践上有未被执行的可埋怨现象。譬如在某工厂组织罢工时，就没有注意把它和政权斗争结合起来，只追求罢工的胜败，这就是经济主义，必须克服这种倾向。
    在今天，任何斗争，如果不摧毁中央或地方政权是不可能解决的，这是最近形势的特点。譬如降低工人工资和裁员是政府强制执行的方针；目前农民的征购，也是政府的政策；中小企业的没落，也是政府施行生产集中与重税的结果；主妇在厨房中的苦恼，都是政治恶劣的结果。就在这个意义上，也说明了经济斗争，必然是和政权斗争结合着的。因此，一切人民的活动，必须集中在夺取政权斗争上。这一点必须经常记在心头，进行日常活动时，以这样预见来进行指导，是很必要的。
    削弱统治者的权力
    那么夺取政权的斗争，具体的要做些什么呢？譬如领导一个经济斗争，要向那一方向前进呢？
    第一、一切活动用于削弱统治阶级的权力，并使之为人民所有。
    在这样场合的所谓权力，就是意味着从村派出所、村公所以至内阁、天皇的上下所有权力机关。
    其次，斗争方法，包括从罢工、示威以至选举、议会活动的所有群众行动与宣传教育活动。
    举个例子吧！
    譬如一件罢工，它不仅为了改善工人的生活，而且侵害资本家的利润，并须为引起“资本主义社会的细小危机”（列宁）而组织进行。
    税金的适当改正运动，不仅为了减轻不合理的课税，还必须批判国家的财政。
    我们必须利用揭露不正当的财产交易，来阻止统治阶级的掠夺并扩大他们之间的矛盾。
    与反动团体斗争，就是扑灭统治阶级的走狗。
    与反动思想斗争，就是为了打倒统治阶级的思想支柱。
    参加中央及地方的选举运动，是为了在议会里获得尽可能多数，动摇保守党及其政府的基地。
    从上述例子看来，一切的日常斗争，有削弱敌人政权的作用，而且必须这样进行领导和组织。所以，即使各个斗争受到挫折，但只要削弱敌人几分力量，也同样可以说是胜利的。
    掌握政权及养成行政能力
    第二、夺取政权斗争的内容，不仅仅削弱敌人的阵营，还须扩大与巩固我方阵营，尤其是作为指导部的共产党，同时要准备掌握政权后的行政能力。我们必须为这个目的进行一切活动。
    为此，党与全体党员，在思想上、理论上就有锻炼之必要。党内有不少各种小资产阶级的思想，既有拘泥于理论的，也有轻视理论与不懂理论的。党真要成为革命的先锋队，必须用革命的无产阶级思想来巩固党，用马列主义理论来武装党。如果没有这个武器，不可能打倒敌人，而且也不能掌握及维持政权，这些事情，必须在日常斗争中，研究会中进行学习。
    与上述的事情同时。为了引导党外的广泛群众与群众团体向革命方向前进，在日常斗争中极积地向群众进行革命的宣传教育，比任何都重要。
    其次，为了打倒敌人，必须加强自己阵营的组织，就是说必须扩大与加强阶级战斗部队。
    作为先锋部队的共产党，必须接受适合于其任务的训练，而且必须有铁的纪律。关于这一点，今天党的组织，决不是应该满足的。首先，党员少，三百万人的选举投票，党只不过吸收了其中二十分之一的党员，而且党员的工作作风和纪律，未必都是良好的。
    同时，党与群众的连系，也不能说密切，在这方面尚须改善的很多。而党外的群众组织，也并不是强大到足以在阶级斗争中发挥其重大作用。尤其农民与中小业主的团体是如此。
    如上所述，在日常工作中加强与扩大党和群众团体的组织，是很重要的。
    击溃敌人的政权，虽直至目前我们仍在强调着，但是取得政权后进行政治工作的力量，应在日常斗争中去培养，今天必须强调。所谓夺取政权的斗争，决不仅仅是打倒现政权，而是人民掌握政权，维持政权，很好地实施新的政治。今后必须准备这个工作。
    为此，共产党必须首先有系统地调查究研组成人民政府应有的重要政策，而且随时准备夺取天下，同时党与党员，必需加强实行这些政策的行政能力。某些资产阶级政治家所说的如“共产党只会破坏，没有建设政权能力”的诽谤，我们必须在实践中来击溃它。
    上述的政策与行政能力，可以在日常党的活动与群众斗争中培植起来的。譬如在村政权与议会的斗争上，我们经常向资产阶级政党提出共产党的政策。而且，在每天党和群众团体的活动上使其获得许多效能与成果，或在共产党指导下的政权的模范行为，均能够培植与建立起行政能力来的。
    争取群众
    夺取政权斗争的第三个内容，就是把在敌人影响下的群众，从敌人的手里夺取过来，参加民主战线，并加强和巩固领导者——共产党与群众的联系。
    当保守党反动势力，依然能够掌握政权时，无论他们是用的欺骗威吓，或者是浮动而不切实际的，但他们总还有广泛群众支持的基础。如果他们失去群众的支持，就是他们政权扑灭的时候。所以政权斗争，结局就是统治阶级与我们争夺群众的斗争。其方法包括经济的、政治的、思想的一切活动。它的组织形态是从工会的统一战线扩大为民主民族战线。
    在这里，所谓争取群众，就是共产党与群众巩固的联系，并使群众愿在共产党领导下进行活动。这就是说，共产党在群众中有最高威信，建立起党对他们的领导。
    共产党怎样才能争取群众呢？第一步，党必须领导为贯彻群众当前的要求而斗争。但是，如果只停留在这方面，群众就不能够深刻了解共产党的本质，因此就不能持久地坚固地拥护党。为了紧密地团结他们，使他们的头脑、思想，必须来个革命的变化。群众并不是在经济斗争中，自然发生革命化的。党需要在群众中积极地进行共产主义的政治宣传教育，群众的思想才会起变化，然后才会成为共产党的积极支持者。
　　三、议会斗争
    议会斗争的根本态度
    在极端不合法下十月革命前的俄国共产党与战前日本共产党，对议会选举与议会活动只能进行宣传鼓动，以合法的工作来掩护非法的革命运动，而且只能起辅助的作用。当时不可能有更高的要求。
    但是，今日的日本，情形大变了。
    由于国内外民主势力的努力，虽然经过曲折，但已获得政治自由，而且国会已不成为天皇制的附属品，在宪法上，成为“国权最高机关”。其次，人民的政治觉悟，也迅速提高。由于以上的变化，就产生了利用选举，可能将多数议员，送进议会去，而且通过议会也可能和政权接近。共产党、社会党、以及其他民主势力，也有建立联合政府的可能。因此共产党对议会的态度，就有改变之必要了。
    在现阶段，议会已经不是单纯的一个宣传鼓动机关，而是（不是唯一的）在取得政权上能发挥主要作用的机关。至少也能阻止与破坏统治阶级反动政策的执行，或削弱敌人阵营。这样在议会中，能有效地进行削弱敌人政权的活动。以上是共产党对战后议会的根本见解。
    议会外的斗争与结合
    但我们和社会民主主义者不同，工人阶级代表在议会内，即使占多数，我们也不会真正幻想统治阶级会很驯服地、没有任何抵抗地将政权让给人民，而且也不认为一切问题在议会可能得到解决。为什么呢？因为统治阶级的权力，决不只在议会内，还在以他们提到的警察为中心的官僚机构内、乡村反动组织内、经济独占组织内与言论机关内。他们利用一切议会外的特权，努力维持其权力，消灭革命势力。因此，我们的斗争如果只限于议会内，那正是统治阶级所最希望的，人民将永远不会掌握到政权。所以，与议会内斗争同时，为了使这些政治的、经济的、思想的统治机构民主化、或软弱化以致于消灭，而加强组织议会外所有的各种群众行动，是绝对必要的。
    其次，为了有效地进行议会内的活动，必须与议会外群众斗争结合起来。更严格地来说，以议会外群众的势力与斗争为基础，议会内的斗争，才能获得效果。脱离议会外群众运动的议会斗争，是无力的。相反的，过去的成绩，指出如以群众的要求与斗争为基础，并与此相结合在议会内进行斗争时，共产党虽有三十五名议员，但能发挥十倍于此的力量，而且，在最近的总选举中，共产党进展的主要原因，就在于党经常积极地进行议会外的日常活动。
    总之，议会内的活动，就是议会外群众斗争的反映，是斗争成果的收获。共产党把主力放在议会外的斗争，同时又与议会内斗争相结合，并统一议会内外使一切斗争前进，这就是与社会民主主义根本不同的地方。
    主要的任务
    根据如上对议会的态度，共产党对当前的议会，有些什么基本任务呢？主要如次：
    揭露日本独占资本反人民反民主主义的政策，阻止及粉碎其强制施行，使反动政府及其与党内部发生动摇分裂，促进其瓦解。
    同时，共产党站在拥护民主主义和独立的前列，为保卫人民大众的生活，展开积极的，具体的斗争。在这时期，党经常发表关于人民的、建设的政策，使群众对党有正确的了解这点，甚为重要。
    议会内的活动和方法，基本上是为了如上所述的配合议会外的群众斗争，这不仅说明把议会外的斗争反映到议会内部，相反的，把议会内的问题，拿到议会外的群众中去，而引起内外互相呼应。
    在议会内，与社会党、劳农党及其他民主势力，对共同问题，成立共同战线，也是一个重要问题。吉田内阁少数独占资本的政策，引起了广大群众的不满和反抗，因此，在各个问题上，就有可能和保守党内代表中小业主的分子，进行提携。其次，把议会内的共同战线，反映到议会外，就能起促进议会外群众团体统一的作用。
    议会是对党与党员进行政治教育训练的学校，而且，必须这样做。如果参加议会，不管你愿意与否，是会正面碰上敌人的，那你就得研究敌人的政策和战术，同时拿出共产党的政策和它对立起来，进行斗争。这就必须学习革命的政治战术。而且为了防止沾染议会内资产阶级的习气，必须进行布尔塞维克的修养，不然，势必脱离党的路线。
    关于共产党议员的斗争
    共产党在选举上的跃进，使统治阶级感到巨大威胁，但给了人民大众光辉的希望。人民对共产党在议会的斗争，抱有很大期望。而共产党的确是依从人民期望的，同时认为党与议员的责任是很重大的。我们不能违背群众的希望，必须依照群众的希望进行斗争，获得成果。关于这点，我提出下面几点：
    共产党和其他政党不同，党为主，议员是从属的，因此，议会内的重要政策与战术，均由党的领导部先行确定，根据这个决定，来统一与指导议会党团在议会内的斗争。在组织范围上，议会党团是从属于党中央委员会（与政治局）的，议员的行动及纪律，也和一般党员没有不同的地方。这就是共产党议会党团的特征。
    资本主义国家的议会，有使工人议员腐化堕落的充分因素。譬如国家对议员给予和一般工人差别甚远的高额的薪给，并给予一般人所没有的种种特权，使议员脱离了工人生活的环境，“忙于国事”，无法进行工人日常斗争与工会运动，也不参加党的生活，成为党的特殊人物。议会内不正派的作风与空气，会使议员成为一个懒惰、愚蠢、堕落的人。其次，资产阶级的新闻给议员捧场、吹嘘，资本家则伸出诱惑之手。如果参加政权，其诱惑更为厉害。象这样从物质精神两方面，使工人议员资产阶级化的作用，议会是具有的。共产党议员，并不能逍遥在这种影响之外。
    为此，共产党议员应采取使各议员不离开群众斗争及党的生活的方法，同时以过正常的党的生活与具有布尔塞维克的修养为各议员的义务。
    议会议员与群众的结合，是最为重要的问题。这种结合，是议会党团的生命，如果失去这种结合，议会党团的生命也就完结。我们必须用全力来保持与加强这种结合。
    为此，我们必须特别努力，一方面将群众的要求和斗争，不断地反映到议会党团里去，另一方面将议会党团的斗争，反映到大众中去。为了这个目的，就有必要进行各种组织，如两方面的联络会、议员座谈会、街头演说、地方政治新闻等。在这里，希望不时举行议会报告演说会。当然最基本的，在于议员不断地和党的活动结合起来。
    结语
    共产党决不是“万年的在野党”，日本的客观条件，已把建立以共产党为中心的人民政权，提到日程上来了，而问题在于迅速创造以共产党作为主力的主要条件。
    为了实现这一任务，首先第一，所有的革命工人，要完全掌握以上的事实，把一切集中于夺取政权的斗争。
    胜利是人民的。
