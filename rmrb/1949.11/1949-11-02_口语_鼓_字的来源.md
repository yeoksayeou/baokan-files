    The Origin of the Spoken Word "Gu"
    Wang Weiran
    Ouyang Shan's "Little Liu Bowen": "Before the Republic of China, his family was still a small landlord. Anyway, afterward, for some unclear reason, his family's fortune 'gu' (鼓) went down, and his parents also died." In the text, is the spoken (dialect) word "gu" (鼓) an obstacle to reading? Whose reading is it an obstacle to? Is the word "gu" (鼓) used incorrectly in the text? Should "gu" (鼓) be written as "gu" (孤), "gu" (估), or "gu" (沽)? I don't think the word "gu" (鼓) in the text is an obstacle to reading, because when workers, peasants, and soldiers read this "gu" (鼓) word, they are very clear about its meaning and its origin. (Editor's note: Pay attention to regionality.) In my hometown, this spoken language exists. When I was in my hometown, I also asked people about the meaning of this "gu" (鼓) word. It is said that because a "drum" (鼓) is something that is empty in the middle, the villagers use it to describe things that are internally empty. For example, if someone goes bankrupt, they say it is "exploded gu" (爆鼓). If his family's business is internally empty, it is said that his family's business is "gu" (鼓). Is the explanation I heard correct? It is best for the workers, peasants, and soldiers to confirm this. Don't casually think that the word "gu" (鼓) is used incorrectly. If the word "gu" (鼓) is written as any of the three words "gu" (孤), "gu" (估), or "gu" (沽), you will not find (in dictionaries or etymological dictionaries) that it means "decline". As for some authors using words, only seeking the correct sound and not asking about the meaning of the word, this is a fact, so I also think that authors should think about the words before using them.

　　口语“鼓”字的来源
    王蔚然
    欧阳山的“小伯温”：“民国以前，他家还是小地主。反正以后，说不清什么理由，他的家业就‘鼓’了，爹娘也死了。”文中口语（方言）“鼓”字，是不是阅读上的障碍？是谁阅读上的障碍？文中“鼓”字是不是用字错误？是不是“鼓”字应写作“孤”字、“估”字或“沽”字？我认为文中的“鼓”字成不了阅读的障碍，因为工农兵阅读到这个“鼓”字的时候，他们很清楚这个字的意思与他的来源出处。（编者按：还要注意地域性。）我的家乡是有这个口语的，在家乡的时候，我也曾把这个“鼓”字的意思问人，据说：因为“鼓”是一个空有其表，中无一物的东西，所以乡间人就把他来形容内部空虚的事物。如破产了，就说是“爆鼓”了，他的家业内部空虚了，就说是他的家业“鼓”了。究竟我听到的这种解释是否对呢？这顶好是由工农大众来证实。不要随便把“鼓”字认为是用字错误。假如把“鼓”字写作“孤”、“估”、“沽”三字中的任何一个，也不会找出（在字典、辞源里）作“衰落”讲来。至于有的作者用字，只求音对，不问字义，这是事实，所以我也认为作者对文字应该思索一下再用。
