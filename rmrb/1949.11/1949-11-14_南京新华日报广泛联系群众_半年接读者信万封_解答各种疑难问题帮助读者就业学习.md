Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, November 11th: The Nanjing Xinhua Daily, the organ of the Nanjing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, is actively carrying out work to connect with the masses and serve its readers. The reader mailbox run by the newspaper's Social Services Department has received over 14,600 letters from readers in the past six months. These include citizens' praise, criticisms, or suggestions regarding the government's various policies and the work of Party, government, military, and civilian sectors, as well as requests for help in resolving employment issues or answering difficult learning questions. The Social Services Department of the newspaper promptly provides answers to the various questions raised by readers or requests that relevant agencies or organizations be responsible for providing answers. In the past six months, 2,236 readers' letters have been published in the newspaper. For those seeking help with employment, the department also makes every effort to obtain assistance from various agencies and organizations to help with introductions. In September and October alone, the department introduced over 450 workers, students, technicians, and public education personnel to work and study at the Southwest Service Corps and other places. As the readers' personal problems are solved, the number of letters from readers is increasing daily. In May, there were only a few letters each day, but by October, the average number of letters received reached 69 per day. The letters demonstrate the increasing trust of the masses in the Communist Party and the Party newspaper. Many readers' letters expose special agents and speculative merchants and secretly report hidden enemy and puppet materials. After the "August 1st" Army Support Movement was launched, the Social Services Department collected over 5 million yuan in donations for the army, accounting for one-fifth of the total donations in the city.

The Social Services Department has also organized the "Xinhua Daily Reader Friendship Association" to help readers learn. Currently, over 800 employees, students, public education personnel, and citizens have become "Reader Friends" of the Xinhua Daily. They are organized into 53 study groups based on occupation and region. The main ways the association helps readers learn is by holding lectures at least once a week. Since mid-October, it has successively held five special lectures on studying the documents of the People's Political Consultative Conference, with over 3,500 people attending. The newspaper also regularly answers difficult questions encountered by readers in their studies in the Social Services column.

In addition, the Social Services Department has also set up a question-and-answer office and a reading room. In July, over 700 people directly inquired at the Social Services Department. The average number of readers in the reading room has also increased from over 70 in September to over 200 in October.

    南京新华日报广泛联系群众
    半年接读者信万封
    解答各种疑难问题帮助读者就业学习
    【新华社南京十一日电】中共南京市委机关报——新华日报积极进行联系群众并为读者服务的工作。该报社会服务室举办的读者信箱半年来共收到读者来信一万四千六百余件，其中包括市民对于政府各种政策，对党政军民各方面工作的赞扬，批评或建议，还有一些是要求帮助解决职业、或解答学习上的疑难问题。该报社会服务室对于读者所提各种问题，都及时给予解答，或请有关机关或团体负责解答。半年来已经有二千二百三十六封读者来信在报上公开发表。对要求帮助解决职业问题的，也尽可能取得各机关团体的协助，帮助介绍。仅九、十两月份经该室介绍到西南服务团等处工作和学习的工人、学生、技术人员、公教人员就有四百五十多人。由于解决了读者的切身问题，读者来信逐日增加。五月间每天只有几封来信，到十月份平均每天来信达六十九封。从来信中，表现出群众对共产党和党报日益信赖。不少读者来信检举特务和投机奸商，密报敌伪暗藏物资。“八一”劳军运动掀起后，社会服务室曾代收劳军捐款五百余万元，占全市捐款总数的五分之一。
    社会服务室又组织了“新华日报读者之友会”，帮助读者学习，现已有职工、学生、公教人员及市民等八百余人成为新华日报“读者之友”。他们按职业、地区组成五十三个学习小组。该会帮助读者学习的主要方式为举办讲演会，每周至少一次。自十月中旬至今已相继举办了五次关于学习人民政协文献的专题演讲，听众在三千五百人以上。对于读者在学习中遇到疑难问题，该报亦定期在社会服务栏内解答。
    此外，社会服务室并设立了问事处和阅览室。七月份一个月直接到社会服务室问事者达七百余人。阅览室的读者每日平均数亦由九月份的七十余人，增至十月份的二百余人。
