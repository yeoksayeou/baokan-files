Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 26th: TASS Moscow dispatch: The *Labor Daily* published an article by Danilov on the 25th entitled "The Burmese People's Struggle for Independence," stating that in the American ruling group's plan to enslave the Asian people, Burma, along with India, occupies an important position. As in Indonesia, Malaya, and other Southeast Asian countries, Anglo-American colonialists are attempting to use local bourgeois elements, like Chiang Kai-shek's ilk, to suppress the people's liberation movement.

　　Danilov discussed in detail the British Labour government's sham "independence" granted to Burma – an independence that, in fact, meant consolidating the oppression of foreign and local exploiters in new forms after many years. The newly formed government, headed by the British lackey Thakin Nu, obediently carried out the will of British imperialism. However, uprisings occurred within the country, protesting Thakin Nu's policy of compromise, the continued plunder of the masses, and the authorities' suppression of the working people. From July to August of last year, the uprisings had already spread to Central and Lower Burma. The insurgents cut off the capital, Rangoon, from Central Burma.

　　Danilov emphasized that, in this situation, the British colonialists began to seriously consider establishing a "strong" government capable of suppressing the national liberation movement. To achieve this goal, British intelligence agents used their old agents – the feudal leaders of various Burmese tribes – to instigate the rebellion of the Karen people, who numbered nearly two million. However, the British imperialists' hopes pinned on the Karen feudal lords were quickly dashed. In the course of fighting with the government army, the Karen insurgents' troops had already begun to stand with the guerrillas opposing the Thakin Nu government. The Labour government, after confirming that its attempt to use the Karen people to support British rule in Burma had failed, once again placed its main bet on Thakin Nu. At the conference of prime ministers of the British Commonwealth in London, it was decided to give Thakin Nu all kinds of financial and military assistance. According to the decisions of this conference, the "committee" currently in Rangoon is controlling the activities of the Burmese government. This committee consists of the ambassadors of Britain, India, Pakistan, and Ceylon, and has a large number of military and political "advisers" at their disposal. Such is the situation of Burmese "independence" under the Labour government.

　　The author continued: Recent developments show that the Burmese government, despite receiving financial and military assistance from Britain, has consistently failed to make any significant changes in its favor on the decisive front lines. On the contrary, the Burmese people's liberation movement has achieved considerable victories. The joint organization of the Communist Party, trade unions, and peasant leagues, as well as the unified front of the "White Flag" People's Volunteer Organization and other guerrillas, has been established in Burma. Together, they form the People's Democratic United Army. The author emphasized that the victory of the Burmese national liberation movement (the organizational form of which is improving every day) is forcing Thakin Nu to hastily send two of his ministers to London and Washington to negotiate for immediate financial and military assistance. Anglo-American imperialists regard this demand as a good excuse to openly carry out military intervention in Burma.

　　Danilov concluded by emphasizing that this new attempt by Anglo-American imperialism to strangle the Burmese national liberation movement is also doomed to failure. The Burmese people are continuing to wage a victorious and selfless struggle to liberate themselves from the oppression of the Anglo-American enslavers and their puppets and to achieve genuine national independence for their motherland.

　　缅解放运动胜利进展  英美帮凶镇压必失败
  　劳动报评论缅甸目前形势
    【新华社北京二十六日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：劳动报于二十五日发表丹尼洛夫所作“缅甸人民争取独立的斗争”的专文称：在美国统治集团奴役亚洲人民的计划中，除了印度以外，缅甸也占着重大的位置。正如在印尼、马来亚和其他东南亚国家一样，英美殖民者企图利用当地民族资产阶级上层分子中的蒋介石之流的人物，来镇压人民解放运动。
    丹尼洛夫详细论及英国工党政府给予缅甸的虚伪的“独立”——这种独立事实上意味着在新的形式上巩固多年以来的外国和当地剥削者的压迫。新近成立的以英国走狗达钦努为首的政府，顺从地履行了英国帝国主义的意志。但是，国内发生了暴动，他们抗议达钦努的妥协政策，抗议继续掠夺人民大众，以及当局对劳动人民的镇压。去年七月至八月，暴动就已经蔓延到中缅甸和下缅甸。暴动者切断了首都仰光与中缅甸的连系。
    丹尼洛夫着重指出：在这种情况下，英国殖民者开始认真地考虑成立能够镇压民族解放运动的“强有力的”政府。为了达到这种目的，英国谍报人员利用他们旧的代理人——缅甸各部落的封建领袖，来挑起将近有两百万人口的克仑族的叛乱。但是，英国帝国主义寄托在克仑族封建主身上的希望，非常迅速地落空了。在与政府军的作战过程中，克仑族暴动者的军队，已经开始与反对达钦努政府的游击队站在一起，工党政府在确信他们利用克仑族来支持英国在缅甸的统治的企图已告失败之后，就再次将它的主要赌注放在达钦努身上。在伦敦举行的不列颠联邦各国总理的会议上，决定给达钦努以各种财政上与军事上的援助。根据这个会议的决定，目前在仰光的“委员会”，正在控制着缅甸政府的活动。这个委员会由英国、印度、巴基斯坦与锡兰的大使组成，有大批的军政“顾问”供他们调遣。这就是工党政府之下的缅甸“独立”的情况。
    作者继称：最近的发展显示，缅甸政府尽管从英国那里得到了财政和军事援助，却始终未能在具有决定性的前线造成任何有利于他们的重要改变。相反地，缅甸人民的解放运动，却已获得了相当大的胜利。共产党、职工会与农民联盟的联合组织，以及“白旗”人民志愿军与其他游击队的统一战线已在缅甸建立。他们共同组成人民民主联军。作者强调指出缅甸民族解放运动的胜利（这个民族解放运动的组织形式每天都有改进），迫使达钦努正在不久前匆忙地派了他的两个部长到伦敦和华盛顿去谈判立即的财政和军事援助。英美帝国主义者把这种要求看作是公开在缅甸进行军事干涉的良好借口
    丹尼洛夫结语强调称：英美帝国主义这个扼杀缅甸民族解放运动的新企图，也是注定了要失败的。缅甸人民正在继续进行胜利的忘我斗争，以争取自英美奴役者及其傀儡的压迫下求解放和祖国真正的民族独立。
