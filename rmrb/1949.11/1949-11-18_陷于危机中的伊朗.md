Iran in Crisis
by Lu Xin, translated by Feng Yi

Iran's economic situation has never been anything to boast about, and now it is experiencing a particularly severe economic crisis. Dozens of large factories in Isfahan, Isd, Bushehr, Tabriz, and other places have closed down or are on the verge of collapse. Hundreds of small and medium-sized handicraft industries have gone bankrupt or are about to close down. Thousands of Iranian workers, artisans, and shop assistants are unemployed and unable to make a living. Hungry crowds wander the streets, searching in vain for any kind of work.

The situation in the countryside is no better. Large numbers of farmers have no food, not because of poor harvests, but because of plunder by landlords and bureaucrats. Because they cannot support themselves until the new harvest, groups of farmers run to the cities hoping to find work to earn some money. Today, this scene can be seen even in the country's most fertile regions, especially Iranian Azerbaijan. Even in the Magheh region, known as the "Granary of Iran," farmers have no grain at all. In most parts of Iranian Azerbaijan, only half of the arable land is being cultivated.

Due to chronic food shortages and appalling sanitation, social diseases are spreading widely. The tuberculosis rate in some provinces is increasing rapidly, especially in Mazandaran Province.

Regarding the disastrous economic plight of the country and the suffering of the people, it is now not only progressive leaders and newspapers that are talking about and reporting it, but even reactionary politicians and newspapers cannot turn a blind eye. Recently, the semi-official newspaper Tehran News wrote: "Iran's industry has entered a serious crisis, which is particularly serious in the textile industry. Many textile factories in Isfahan have closed down, and thousands of workers have been laid off."

The newspaper also admitted that the government has not taken effective measures to deal with the crisis.

It is worth noting the recent report of the Merlis Budget Committee published in the Idra newspaper. The report pointed out that the 1949 budget, with revenue (including expected income from the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company) of only 7.785 billion rials, while expenditures would exceed 11 billion rials. The deficit exceeds 3 billion rials - a catastrophic figure for Iran.

Official newspapers frankly admit that the current economic chaos is engulfing the country, with the threat of a total collapse of industry and commerce, constant price increases, and a continuous surge in unemployment. Rikpu, who once served as Deputy Minister of Finance, recently claimed that the crisis has "extended its destructive influence to all sectors of economic life." Iran newspaper reported: "The market situation in Iran has never been more serious than it is today."

How did this situation come about? Why is a country that can export food forced to import hundreds of thousands of tons of grain? Why are people starving?

The root of all evil lies in the anti-people policies of the rulers. The rulers have allowed the country to be slaughtered by British and American imperialists. Iran is becoming a colony of American imperialism day by day. This cruelly makes the national industry inevitably fall into ruin. Not only democrats, but also many businessmen, manufacturers, and representatives of Merlis admit that the influx of American goods into Iran has produced disastrous results. Due to the lack of control by the government and customs authorities, American merchants have taken the opportunity to ship large quantities of inferior goods into Iran. Iranian merchants have good reason to demand restrictions on this kind of fatal import, which threatens the total destruction of national industry. In June, the Idra newspaper reported:

"On the one hand, ready-made clothing, socks, shirts, and textiles are flowing into Iran, while on the other hand, the export of cotton yarn and other products of national industry is prohibited. As a result, Iranian products cannot compete with imported goods. If this situation continues, it will inevitably lead to the closure of our factories and handicrafts and create unemployment."

Another newspaper - Marden - spoke more bluntly on this issue, stating that the government's policies "have brought domestic and international trade to a miserable state" and "the threat of bankruptcy is becoming increasingly prominent," and continued to comment:

"The reasons are: first, the increasing import of foreign goods; second, strict banking regulations (prohibiting loans to national industries to purchase raw materials and equipment). Large quantities of goods from Europe, America, and Japan are flooding the Tehran market. In the past few years, the government has not properly regulated this, and gold pounds and dollars have been taken away from our poor country."

It should be particularly mentioned that the goods shipped into Iran by American merchants are all goods that are competing with Iranian industry and handicrafts. As for the Iranian authorities, they use various methods to restrict and prohibit the export of goods that cannot be sold domestically due to the dumping of American goods. For example, made cotton yarn and certain textiles are prohibited from export, while raw cotton is not prohibited. This is exactly what American monopoly capitalists expect.

As a result, today Iran's imports are many times greater than its exports. Even sales of an important Iranian export item - Persian carpets - have vanished. Iran's hard currency reserves are being rapidly depleted, because exports are extremely difficult, and the available hard currency is being spent on arms and luxury goods made in America purchased by the wealthy.

How can we get out of this predicament? Most Iranians no longer believe in the "Seven-Year Plan" drafted by the American delegation, and even those who initially believed in and welcomed this "plan" are disappointed in it. Representatives of Merlis say that the Iranian government does not have the financial resources to implement this plan. The government cannot rely on issuing domestic debt (which Prime Minister Shat himself admits). Hopes for borrowing loans from the United States for economic purposes are also very weak. The deputy manager of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, controlled by the United States, frankly stated that the bank cannot trust the Iranian authorities to grant loans. As for the "aid" that the American rulers plan to give to Iran, U.S. Secretary of State Acheson recently made the nature of "aid" very clear. On August 8, Acheson said in a speech in the Senate: Iran has already received military assistance to arm it against the Soviet Union, and that is the kind of assistance that will be expanded proportionally in the future.

This "aid" is by no means intended to promote Iran's prosperity, but to enslave Iran; this is almost an open secret. Even Prime Minister Shat could not hide a few days ago that the United States' post-war aid to Iran was only the sale of weapons and army equipment; but the starving Iranian people need bread, not cannons. "Two hundred thousand tons of wheat are more useful than two hundred thousand guns."

The democrats of Iran know that there is a way to save their country from economic collapse and mass starvation. Their demands are: to prevent the entry of American goods and American missions, "experts" and "advisers"; to encourage national industry and commerce; to protect industry and commerce from the fatal American competition; to adopt sound trade and monetary policies that conform to national interests; to implement democratic reforms in rural areas and reduce the burden on workers. Of course, there is an indispensable thing to do to save the country, which is to abolish autocracy and police terror, and implement a democratic system.

However, the rulers of Iran have no intention of adopting these methods. On the contrary, they are stepping up their crackdown on those who are "dissatisfied with the status quo," that is, the starving people. They have always maintained a policy of kowtowing to American colonial imperialism, throwing Iran into aggressive blocs, buying weapons instead of food, and turning the country into a strategic bridgehead for American and British imperialism.

But by doing so, they are further enslaving their country and driving it into the abyss of economic disaster.

### 陷于危机中的伊朗

　　陷于危机中的伊朗
    卢新著  冯仪译
    伊朗经济情况从来就毫无可夸，现在正经历着特别严重的经济危机。在伊斯发罕、伊斯德、布什尔、大不里士和其他地方的几十家大工厂关了门或者奄奄一息。成百的中小手工业破产了或者行将倒闭。成千的伊朗工人、手工业者和店员们遭遇失业，无法谋生。饥饿的人群徘徊在街头，徒然地在找求任何工作。
    乡村的情况也并不见得好一点。大批的农民没有粮食，倒不是因为粮食歉收，而是由于被地主和官僚劫掠所造成的。因为不到新收时就无法养活自己，所以成群的农民跑到城里希望找个事情挣点钱。今天，这种景象即使在国内最肥沃的地区，特别是伊朗的亚塞尔拜然，也可以见到。甚至誉为“伊朗谷仓”的玛格赫区，农民一点谷米也没有。在伊朗的亚塞尔拜然的大部分地区，可耕种的土地还只有一半是种着东西。
    由于长期的食物不足和惊人的不卫生情况，社会性的疾病正广泛地散布着。有些省分的肺病率正飞跃地进展，特别是在玛热德兰省。
    关于国内的灾难性的经济窘况和人民遭受的困苦，现在不仅是进步的领袖和报纸在谈论和报导着，甚至反动的政客和报纸也不能熟视无睹了。最近半官方的报纸德黑兰新闻写道：“伊朗的工业已进入严重的危机，这在纺织工业特别严重，伊斯发罕的许多纺织工厂倒闭了，成千的工人失业了。”
    该报也承认：政府尚没有采取有效措施以应付危机。
    值得注意的是最近在伊德拉报上发表的麦里斯预算委员会的报告。该报告指出一九四九年的预算，岁入（包括希望从英伊石油公司获得的收入在内）将仅七十七亿八千五百万里耳，而岁出则将超过一百十亿里耳。赤字超过三十亿里耳。——对伊朗来说，这是一个灾难性的数字。
    官方报纸坦白承认：目前经济混乱笼罩着全国，工商业有总崩溃的威胁，不断的物价上涨，与失业人数不断激增。一度担任副财长的里克普，最近声称危机业已“伸展其破坏的影响遍及经济生活的各部门”。伊朗报报导：“伊朗的市场情况，再也没有比今天更严重了”。
    这种情况是如何造成的呢？为什么一个可以输出粮食的国家却被迫要输入几十万吨的粮食？为什么人们要挨饿？
    一切罪恶的根源在于统治者的反人民政策。统治者们已将国家听英美帝国主义者宰割。伊朗正一天天地沦为美帝国主义的殖民地。这就残酷地使民族工业不能避免地陷于毁灭。不仅是民主分子，而且也是许多商人、装造业者、和麦里斯的代表们都承认：美货充斥伊朗，产生了灾难性的结果。由于政府及海关当局不加控制，美商趁机将大批劣等货品运入伊朗。伊朗的商人有充分的理由要求限制此种使民族工业有全部毁灭危险的致命输入。在六月的伊德拉报报导：
    “一方面现成的服装、袜子、衫衣、纺织品流入伊朗，他方面却禁止棉纱和民族工业的其他产品输出。结果伊朗的产品就不能与进口的货物竞争。这种情况继续下去，必然会使我国的工厂和手工业倒闭和造成失业”。
    另一报纸——马尔登报——在这一个问题上谈得更直爽，该报讲政府的政策“已使国内国际贸易陷于悲惨的地步”和“破产的威胁日益显著”，继续评论称：
    “其原因是：第一，外国货物进口日增；第二，严格的银行法规（禁止贷款给民族工业购进原料与设备）。从欧洲、美洲和日本运来的大宗货物充斥于德黑兰市场，于过去数年内，政府没有适当的管制，而从我们贫穷的国度里携走了金磅和美元。”
    应该特别提及的一点是，美商运入伊朗的商品，都是正与伊朗工业和手工业竞争的商品。至于伊朗当局却用各种方法来限制和禁止那些由于美货的倾销而在国内不能销售的货品之输出。比如，制成的棉纱和某些纺织品被禁止出口，而原棉却不在禁止之列。这正是美国独占资本家所期望的。
    结果，今天伊朗的进口比出口大好几倍。甚至一项重要的伊朗出口货——波斯地毯——的销路也已化为乌有。伊朗的硬币准备金迅速地消耗，因为出口极端困难，而可用的硬币正化在军火上和富人们购买美制奢侈品上。
    怎样才能摆脱这种困境呢？大多数的伊朗人已不再相信美国代表团所拟就的“七年计划”，甚至那些最初深信和欢迎这“计划”的人们也对它失望了。麦里斯的代表们说伊朗政府没有财力实现这一计划。政府不能依靠发内债（这是内阁总理沙特自己承认的）。向美国举借经济目的的贷款，希望也很微弱。为美国所控制的国际复兴银行的副经理坦白声称，银行不能相信伊朗当局而给予贷款。至于美国统治者计划给予伊朗的“援助”，恰恰是美国国务卿艾奇逊最近把“援助”的性质讲得极明显。八月八日，艾奇逊在参院的发言中说：伊朗已经受到军事的援助，把它武装起来反对苏联，这就是将来会按照比例扩充而给予的援助。
    这种“援助”决不是打算推进伊朗的繁荣，而是要奴役伊朗；这一点简直是公开的秘密了。甚至几天前内阁总理沙特也不能掩饰说：美国战后对伊朗的援助只是武器和陆军装备的售卖；但饥饿的伊朗人民需要的是面包，不是大炮。“二十万吨的小麦比二十万枝枪炮还要有用些”。
    伊朗的民主分子知道，有一个办法可以拯救他们的国家不致经济崩溃与群众饥饿。他们的要求是：阻止美货和美国使命团，“专家”和“顾问”们的入国；鼓励民族工商业；保护工商业不使其受致命的美国竞争所危害；采取符合民族利益的健全的贸易政策和货币政策；实行农村的民主改革和减轻工人的负担。当然，拯救国家有一不可或缺的事要做，就是取消专制和警宪恐怖，实行民主制度。
    然而伊朗的统治者无意采纳这些办法。他们反而是加紧取缔“不满现状”的人们，即饥饿的人民。他们一直保持着对美国殖民帝国主义叩头的政策，将伊朗投入侵略集团，购买武器而不购买粮食，将国家沦为美英帝国主义战略的桥头堡。
    但他们这样做下去，正使他们国家更进一步地受奴役，驱使它堕入经济灾难的深渊。
