    Rescuing the Mother in Disaster: A Record of the Disaster Relief Conference of the Russian Language Brigade of North China University
    Gong Tao
    Over five hundred students from the Russian Language Brigade of North China University held a disaster relief conference in the library.
    A cadre comrade reviewed his past, saying: "My background is that of a landlord. I remember in 1947, when Hebei Province suffered a drought, and the crops were about to wither. The peasants sighed as they looked at the withered yellow seedlings, and their children gnawed on bran cakes. But I laughed at their pitiful poverty. Thinking about it today, it's my most painful memory... Later, I joined the revolution and came to North China University. My living allowance increased from six catties of millet to twenty catties, and then to sixty catties. I often ate white flour馒头mantou and pork. Sometimes I felt embarrassed when I ate, so I would shout a couple of times: 'Oh dear! The burden on the peasants is too heavy!' But when the dishes weren't very good one day, I would say again: 'This is too lacking in nutrition, with no fat or protein!' When the living allowance was distributed, I planned to buy toothpaste, soap, cotton shoes... but I never planned to contribute to disaster relief. I often said that I wanted to be a loyal son of the working people, and I also told others to serve the working people loyally, but I was still not connected to the working people by blood. I am truly ashamed! From this month on, I will save ten catties of millet every month and respond to all disaster relief movements." Amidst applause, a car worker comrade wearing a shiny, tattered coat walked onto the stage:
    "Comrades, I don't know what to say. My family is also in the disaster area. I received a letter from home saying that it had been raining heavily since June 13th, straight through to August 14th, and all the crops were gone. Today, although I eat my fill and dress warmly at North China University, I think of them every time I pick up my bowl, and I can't eat. Now I must resolutely economize, and I know that disaster relief is saving myself!" His voice was somewhat choked, and the comrades were all moved by him.
    Another comrade said: "Last winter, we rushed to outside Beijing City, waiting for the liberation of Beijing. Traveling at night, the weather was very cold, and the comrades were all shivering. On the road, we met a group of villagers pushing carts, loaded with bags of millet, sorghum, and soybeans. We curiously asked: 'Villagers, where are you going?'
    'We're going to Beijing City! To send food to our Liberation Army comrades!'
    'Did you come from Zhengding?'
    'No, we came from Jinan. Comrade, is Beijing about to be liberated?'
    We were really embarrassed to complain about the cold. They pushed their small handcarts, loaded with the grain they had saved, step by step from over a thousand *li*, supporting the front lines day and night. The peasants contributed so much to the War of Liberation. Now that they are suffering from disaster, we should do our best to help them."
    A female comrade continued in a trembling voice: "I once saw with my own eyes a peasant being brutally beaten by the Japanese because he buried his grain and didn't hand it over to the enemy. He wouldn't say a word. The enemy couldn't do anything, so they searched and took the little bit of grain he had kept for himself. That night, the Liberation Army came, and he painfully got up and handed the grain buried in the field to a fellow villager, who ran five *li* to deliver it to the Liberation Army. Our victory today is all thanks to the painful struggle and labor of the peasants. The peasants are our mothers. But today, our mother is suffering from disaster. Can we, these children, forget our roots? I am willing to donate all of my living allowance!"
    The audience erupted in enthusiastic applause. The students of Class One and Class Two issued a challenge, each saving one *liang* of millet per day, donating their clothes, and living allowances, all to make the greatest effort to rescue our mother in disaster! The mother's disaster is our disaster! We want our mother to be happy! We want our mother to be safe!

    抢救灾难中的母亲  记华北大学俄文大队的救灾大会
    公陶
    华北大学俄文大队的五百多同学，在图书室里开救灾大会。
    一个干部同志检讨了他的过去说：“我的出身是一个经营地主。我记得一九四七年河北闹旱灾，眼看着禾苗就要枯死了，农民望着枯黄的禾苗叹息，他的小孩在啃糠粑；而我却笑他们那穷困的可怜样。今天想起来是我最痛苦的记忆。……后来我参加了革命，到了华北大学，生活补助费由小米六斤到二十斤，到六十斤，常吃白面馒头猪肉。有时吃得难为情了，就叫两声：‘哎呀！农民负担太重了！’可是当有一天菜不大好时我又说：‘这太缺乏营养，没有脂肪，也没有蛋白质！’生活补助费发下来了，我计划着买牙膏、香皂、棉鞋……可就没计划过救灾。我常常说要做劳动人民忠诚的儿女，我也告诉别人要为劳动人民忠诚服务，而我和劳动人民却还是那样不血肉相关，我真惭愧！从这月起我每月节省十斤小米，并响应一切救灾运动。”迎着掌声，一位穿着油光破大衣的汽车工人同志走上了讲台：
    “同志们，我不懂得说啥好。我家也在灾区，家里来信说从六月十三就下大雨，直下到八月十四，庄稼全没了。今天我虽然在华大吃得饱、穿得暖，可是每天我一端起饭碗就想起他们，吃不下去。现在我一定要坚决节约，我晓得救灾就是救自己！”他的声音有些呜咽，同志们都被他感动了。
    另一位同志说：“去年冬天我们赶到北京城外，等待着北京的解放。黑夜行车，天气又很冷，同志们都冻得发抖。在路上遇见了一群老乡推着小车，载满了一袋袋的小米、高粱、黄豆，我们好奇的问：‘老乡，你们到那里去？’
    ‘我们到北京城去呀！给咱们解放军同志送粮食呵！’
    ‘你们从正定来的吗？’
    ‘不是，俺从济南来。同志，北京快解放了吧！’
    我们听了真不好意思叫冷。他们从一千多里的地方，一步一步的推着小手车，推着自己节省下来的粮食，日以继夜的支援前线。农民在解放战争中出力多大呀，如今他们遭受了灾难，我们应当尽力帮助他们才对。”
    一个女同志以激动得发抖的声音接着说：“我曾亲眼看见一个农民，因为他把粮食埋起来了，不交给敌人，而被日本人毒打，他总不说。敌人没法，就搜去了他家里留着吃的一点粮食。当天晚上，解放军来了，他忍痛爬起来把地里埋的粮食交给一个老乡，五里路一站的跑步的送给解放军。我们今天的胜利，都是农民痛苦的斗争和劳动换来的。农民是我们的母亲。可是今天母亲受了灾害，我们这群儿女还能忘本吗？我愿献出我全部的生活补助费！”
    台下掀起了热烈的掌声。一班二班的同学提出了挑战，每人每天节约一两小米，献出自己的衣服、生活补助费，都要以最大的努力来抢救我们在灾难中的母亲！母亲的灾难就是我们的灾难！我们要母亲幸福！我们要母亲安全！
