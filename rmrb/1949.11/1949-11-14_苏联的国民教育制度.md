    The National Education System of the Soviet Union
    Professor Méi Dǐngsī Jī
    Translated by Yú Zhuōjié

    The national education system of the Soviet Union is established based on the principles listed in Chapters 1 and 2 of this book (i.e., "Pedagogy"). Let us recall some of the most important of these principles: first, schools are run by the state; Soviet citizens, regardless of race, nationality, or gender, have equal educational opportunities; the extensive development of Soviet national culture with national forms and socialist content; the implementation of teaching in the students' native language; separation of schools from religion; mutual coherence of all links in the national education system and the unity of schools; implementation of universal, compulsory, and free education within the scope of seven-year schools, and everyone has the opportunity to enter secondary schools and universities; the connection between schools, preschool and after-school children's educational institutions, and children's parents in the cause of children's education; the leading role of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in cultural and educational work, and the extensive participation of social organizations (All-Union Leninist Young Communist League, All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, etc.) in national education.
    The Soviet Union's national education system includes preschool education facilities, schools, after-school children's education facilities, and adult cultural and educational facilities. From this, we can see that the characteristic of the Soviet national education system is the comprehensiveness and diversity of its cultural and educational facilities.
    Preschool education facilities include kindergartens, children's playgrounds, and a type of preschool children's home. All such educational facilities accommodate children aged three to seven.
    Kindergartens and children's playgrounds (which differ from kindergartens only in that they are temporary – generally summer children's playgrounds) provide children with appropriate physical education, develop their intelligence, enable children to understand their surroundings, develop their language, accustom children to collective life and activities, cultivate their independent habits, and interest in loving labor, provide preliminary communist moral education, and preliminary aesthetic education, and educate children to love the Soviet state and their own people.
    The characteristics of the bourgeois preschool education system are abstract, empty, dry, trivial, absurd, and mysterious, conducting bourgeois moral education for children. In contrast, the Soviet preschool education system aims to enable children to develop in an all-round way, and its difference is that it is lively and takes into account the characteristics of children of different ages.
    Children in kindergartens are grouped by age: small group – three to four years old, middle group – four to five years old, large group – five to six years old.
    General kindergartens can be divided into three or four groups according to age, with twenty-five people in each group. In individual cases, kindergartens have only one or two groups. Each group has a childcare worker who has received special training in preschool children's education.
    The time children spend in kindergarten each day is stipulated as nine to twelve hours (most common is – nine to ten hours). The daily activities of the kindergarten are carried out according to a prescribed timetable of activities (children's games and homework, two walks, three meals, daytime rest, etc.).
    The Soviet school system includes general schools, vocational schools, and institutions of higher education (see the chart on the left).
    Four-year primary schools accommodate children aged seven to ten. This type of school is free, universal, and compulsory education. The teaching plans and teaching syllabuses of primary schools are the same as those of the first four grades of seven-year schools and secondary schools.
    Seven-year schools for children aged seven to thirteen graduate in seven academic years. In urban areas and workers' residential areas, it has already been implemented to complete the curriculum of such schools compulsorily; in rural areas, it will be implemented in a few years. Education in this type of school is free. The teaching plans and teaching syllabuses of seven-year schools are the same as those of the first seven years of secondary schools.
    Ten-year secondary schools for children aged seven to sixteen. From the 1943-1944 academic year, single-sex schools for boys and girls began to be established in large cities. After graduating from secondary school, one is qualified to enter institutions of higher education (those who have won medals can be exempted from examinations, and the rest must pass examinations in certain subjects according to the nature of the major in the institution of higher education).
    In July 1943, the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union decided to establish schools for young workers. These schools were organized in urban areas and workers' residential areas for young people working in enterprises, mines, transportation departments, and agencies. These schools enable general students to receive secondary education without leaving production. Schools for young workers only have the fifth to tenth grades of secondary school (sometimes there are also preparatory classes).
    Since 1944, night schools for rural youth have been established, which are primary schools and seven-year schools established for young people working in collective farms and state farms.
    Schools for young workers and night schools for rural youth accommodate young people aged fourteen to twenty-five.
    Graduates of seven-year schools for young workers or rural youth enjoy the same rights as graduates of ordinary seven-year schools; that is to say, it is also equivalent to the rights enjoyed by graduates of secondary schools for young workers.
    Graduates of seven-year schools can enter the eighth grade of secondary school, or they can choose another path of advanced study, entering secondary vocational schools (technical schools, medical schools, normal schools, etc.) to train intermediate specialists (technicians, nurses, primary school teachers, etc.). These schools are all three- to four-year systems. The difference from secondary vocational schools in bourgeois countries is that they do not block the possibility of graduates of these schools receiving further higher education: graduates of technical schools, normal schools, and medical schools still have the right to enter institutions of higher education after three years of specialized work.
    In 1940, two- to three-year vocational schools and railway schools (after graduating from primary school) were opened to train qualified employees. They enroll children aged fourteen to fifteen, both male and female. These schools train qualified workers. In order to train a large number of employees, there are factory schools with a study period of six to twelve months. It belongs to the lower-level vocational schools and is under the care of the labor reserve system. Students in these schools are funded by the state.
    Higher education in the Soviet Union has achieved great development. Since the founding of the Soviet state, especially since 1930, hundreds of higher education institutions – universities, research institutes, and academies of sciences – have been established. In 1946, the Soviet Union had 792 higher education institutions and 653,000 university students – more than the total number of 22 European countries combined.
    The universities of the Soviet Union (a total of 31) are institutions of higher education that study basic theoretical subjects – social sciences (i.e., humanities), mathematical and physical sciences, biological sciences, and geographical sciences. The duration of study at the university is five years. Universities train senior specialized researchers in various scientific departments, as well as teachers for secondary schools.
    In the Soviet Union, in order to carry out scientific research in various departments (industry, agriculture, medicine, etc.), there is a dense network of research institutes with a study period of four to six years to meet specialized needs.
    The training of teachers for senior grades (8-10) of secondary schools is carried out in four-year educational research institutes. Educational research institutes have: language, history, geography, mathematics and physics, natural science, foreign language, and other departments. All students, regardless of their department, must study various educational subjects: psychology, pedagogy, history of education, school hygiene, and general teaching methods – and must participate in educational practice in secondary schools.
    In order to train teachers for grades 5-7, there are two-year normal colleges.
    In higher education institutions, scientific research institutions, and academies of sciences, there is a three-year postgraduate system in order to train scientific workers and faculty members of higher education institutions. Anyone who volunteers to be a postgraduate student must be an excellent graduate of a higher education institution, regardless of gender, and show interest and ability in scientific research work during the study period. After passing the examination, they can be selected. In the third year, the assigned work of the postgraduate student is to prepare a degree thesis. After the explanation of the degree thesis and obtaining excellent results, the young scientific worker can obtain the degree of Candidate of Science.
    For children who are blind, deaf, and mentally handicapped, there are special schools with dormitories. Under the provisions of universal compulsory education, these children receive teaching and upbringing.
    In the Soviet Union, what is very popular is: correspondence secondary schools for adults, as well as correspondence departments of technical schools and higher education institutions, so that those who have already joined the workforce can continue to receive education without leaving production. Students who graduate from these correspondence schools and correspondence departments participate in the graduation examination of general courses, and after graduation, they can enjoy the same rights as those enjoyed by students who graduate from ordinary schools of the same nature.
    In the Soviet Union, in order to develop children's interest in science and technology and encourage their creativity and reasonable leisure activities, there are various after-school activity institutions for children. These institutions, due to their connection with schools, assist schools and carry out a large number of cultural and educational work.
    The institutions belonging to this category include: Children's Palaces and Children's Homes, Young Natural Science Research Stations and Young Technology Research Stations, Children's Travel Agencies, Children's Cultural Rest Parks, Young Audience Theaters, Children's Ski Stations, etc.
    The Soviet national education system includes various adult cultural and educational institutions. In order to guide these institutions, the Council of Ministers of the Union Republics has a Committee for Cultural and Educational Institutions.
    These institutions can be divided into four main types:
    (1) Cultural and educational institutions of the club type (workers' clubs and farmers' clubs, cultural centers, cultural rest parks, rural reading rooms, etc.);
    (2) Libraries (republic-level, provincial-level, municipal-level, district-level, etc.);
    (3) Exhibition halls (historical museums, memorial halls, natural history museums, geographical exhibition halls, art exhibition halls, etc.);
    (4) Lecture halls.
    Whether in terms of the number and types of after-school education institutions for children and cultural and educational institutions for adults, or in terms of the content and political and ideological direction of their work, or even in terms of the millions of people they affect – the Soviet national education system is second to none in the world.

    苏联的国民教育制度
    梅鼎斯基教授  作  于卓节译
    苏联的国民教育制度，是根据本书（即“教育学”）第一二两章所列举的原则建立起来的。我们回忆一下其中最主要的一些原则吧：首先是学校由国家办理；苏联公民，不分种族，不分国籍，不分男女，教育机会一律平等；民族形式和社会主义内容的苏联国民文化之广泛的发展；实行采用学生本族的语文教学；学校脱离宗教；国民教育制度一切环节互相连贯与学校的统一；在七年制学校范围内实行普及的强迫的免费教育，以及人人皆得进入中等学校和高等学校；在儿童的教养事业中，学校，学龄前与学校外的儿童教育机关和儿童父母的联系；联共（布）在文化教育中所起的领导作用，以及社会团体（全联列宁共产主义青年团，联工联合会等等）广泛的参加国民教育事业。
    苏联的国民教育制度包括学龄前的教育设施，学校、学校以外的儿童教育设施，以及成人的文教设施。从这里可以看到，苏联国民教育制度的特点，是它的文化教育设施的全面性和多种多样性。
    属于学龄前教育设施的有幼稚园，儿童运动场，还有一种学龄前的儿童之家。所有这类教育设施收容的儿童以三至七岁为限。
    幼稚园和幼儿运动场（它和幼稚园不同之点仅仅在于它是临时性的——一般的都是夏季的儿童运动场），对儿童进行适当的体育教育，发展他们的智力，使儿童认识他们周围的环境，发展他们的语言，使儿童习惯于集体的生活和活动，培养他们独立的习惯，和爱好劳动的兴趣，给与初步的共产主义的道德教育，和初步的审美教育，教育儿童爱苏维埃国家和自己的人民。
    资产阶级学龄前教育制度的特点，是抽象空洞、干燥无味、斤斤细节、荒诞神秘，对儿童进行资产阶级的道德教育。和这相反，苏维埃学龄前教育制度，目的是在使儿童得到全面的发展，它的不同之点是生动活泼，考虑到儿童的不同年龄的特征。
    幼稚园的儿童是以年龄来分组：小组——是三—四岁，中组——四—五岁，大组——五—六岁。
    一般幼稚园，可以按照年龄的不同分成三组或四组，每组二十五个人。个别情况下，幼稚园只有一—二组。每组设保育员一人，她受有关于学龄前儿童教育的特殊训练。
    儿童每天停留在幼稚园的时间规定为九—十二小时（最普通是——九—十小时）。幼稚园每天的活动，按照规定的活动时间表（儿童游戏和作业，两次散步，三次餐点，昼寝等等）进行。
    苏联的学制是包括着一般学校、职业学校和高等学校（参看左面的图表）。
    四年制小学收容七岁到十岁以内的儿童。这类学校——是免费的普及的强迫教育。小学的教学计划和教学大纲，跟七年制学校、中学头四个年级的教学计划和教学大纲是一样的。
    为七——十三岁儿童而设的七年制学校是七个学年毕业的。在城市和工人住宅区域，已经实行强迫修完这类学校的功课；在乡村地带，不用几年也要实行了。这类学校的教育是免费的。七年制学校的教学计划和教学大纲，是和中学的前七年的教学计划和教学大纲相同的。
    为七——十六岁儿童而设的十年制的中学。从一九四三——一九四四学年度起，在大城市开始创办男女分校的男中和女中。中学毕业之后，就有资格进入高等学校（得有奖章的可以免试，其余的要按照高等学校专业的性质，经过某些科目的考试）。
    一九四三年七月，苏联部长会议议决成立青年工人学校，这类学校是为了在企业中，在矿山中，在运输部门，以及在机关中工作的青年，在城市和工人住宅区域组织起来的。这类学校使一般学生可能不脱离生产而受到中等教育。青年工人学校只有中学的第五至第十年级（有时还设有预备班）。
    从一九四四年起，又创办有农村青年夜校，是为了在集体农场和国营农场工作的青年而设立的小学和七年制学校。
    在青年工人学校和农村青年夜校中，收容十四岁至二十五岁的年青人。
    青年工人或农村青年七年制学校毕业学生，和普通七年制学校毕业学生享受同样的权利；那就是说，也相当于青年工人中学毕业学生所享受到的权利。
    七年制学校毕业学生，可以进入中学的第八年级，也可以选择另外一条深造的道路，进入中等职业学校（技术学校，医科学校，师范学校等等），培养中级的专家（技术人员，护士，小学教师等等）。这类学校都是三——四年制。和资产阶级国家中等职业学校不同之点是，他们并不堵塞这些学校毕业学生进一步去受高等教育的可能：技术学校，师范学校，和医科学校的毕业生，在做了三年的专门工作以后，还有着进入高等学校的权利。
    在一九四○年，为了培养合格的职工而开办了二——三年制的职业学校和铁路学校（小学毕业以后），在那里招收十四——十五岁的儿童，男女兼收。这类学校培养合格的工人。为了培养大量的职工，设有学习期限六——十二个月的工厂学校。它是属于低级的职业学校，是在劳动后备队系统关切之下的。这类学校的学生，受国家经费的资助。
    苏联的高等教育得到了巨大的发展。从苏维埃国家成立的年代起，特别是从一九三○年开始，创办了几百所高等教育机关——大学，研究院，和科学院。在一九四六年，苏联有着七百九十二所高等教育机关，六十五万三千名大学生——比全欧洲二十二个国家的数字合在一起还要多。
    苏联的大学（总计三十一所）——是研究基础理论学科——社会科学（亦即人文科学），数理科学，生物科学，以及地理科学的高等教育机关。大学的修业期限——是五年。大学培养各种科学部门的高级专门研究人员，以及中等学校的师资。
    在苏联，为了各个部门科学的研究（工业，农业，医科等等），设有为适应专门需要，而修业期限四——六年的密集的研究院网。
    中等学校高年级（八—十）师资的培养，是在四年制的教育研究院里进行的。教育研究院设有：语文，历史，地理，数理，自然科学，外国语等等学系。所有的学生，不问什么学系，都要研究各种教育学科：心理学，教育学，教育史，学校卫生，和普通教学法——并且要在中学参加教育实践。
    为了培养五——七年级的师资，设有二年制的师范学院。
    在高等教育机关里，在科学研究机关里，以及在科学院里，设有三年制的研究生制度，以便培养科学工作人员和高等学校的教员。凡是志愿做研究生的人，必须是高等教育机关优秀的毕业生，不分男女，并在学习期间表现出对科学研究工作有兴趣，有能力，经过考试及格后，才能入选。第三年，研究生被指定的工作是准备学位论文，经过学位论文的说明，获有很好的成绩之后，年青的科学工作者就可以得到科学侯补人的学位。
    为了眼睛看不见的，耳朵听不见的，以及智力有缺陷的儿童，设有特殊的具备宿舍的学校。在普及的强迫的教育的规定之下，这类儿童得到了教和养。
    在苏联，非常流行的是：为成年人设立的函授中学，以及技术学校和高等教育机关的函授部，使那些已经参加工作的人，能够不脱离生产，继续受到教育。从这类函授学校和函授部毕业的学生，参加了一般课程的毕业考试，毕业以后就可以享受到从同样性质的普通学校毕业学生所享受到的同样的权利。
    在苏联，为了发展儿童对于科学和技术的兴趣，鼓励他们的创造性和合理的休闲活动，有着各式各样的儿童校外活动机关，这类机关由于和学校取得了联系，辅助学校，而展开了大量的文教工作。
    属于这类机关的有：儿童之宫与儿童之家，少年自然科学研究站与少年技术研究站，儿童旅行社，儿童文化休息公园，少年观众剧院，儿童滑雪站等等。
    苏联国民教育制度包括着各式各样的成人文化教育机关。为了指导这类机关，盟员共和国部长会议，附设有文教机关事业委员会。
    这类机关可以分为四种主要的类型：
    （一）俱乐部类型的文教机关（工人俱乐部与农民俱乐部，文化馆，文化休息公园，农村阅览室等等）；
    （二）图书馆（共和国立的，省立的，市立的，区立的等等）；
    （三）陈列馆（历史博物馆，纪念馆，自然博物馆，地理陈列馆，艺术陈列馆等等）；
    （四）讲演厅。
    无论就儿童校外教育机关与成人文教机关的数量与种类来说，或是就他们工作的内容和政治思想方向来说，乃至就他们所影响到的几百万人民来说——苏联的国民教育制度在全世界是首屈一指的。
