Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 6th: Mao Dun published an article in the inaugural issue of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Monthly, entitled: Before the October Revolution, the reactionaries were frantic and trembling! The full text is as follows:

　　In the past month, people all over the world (including the Chinese people) have been protesting with infinite anger against the illegal verdict of the New York Federal Court, which serves Wall Street, on the eleven leaders of the American Communist Party by the US imperialism, against the same shameless oppression of the Australian Communist leaders by the so-called Labor government of Australia, and against the bloody crimes of the Greek puppet regime, the running dog of British and American imperialism, which inhumanly murdered democratic and progressive people.

　　People can see clearly: in the past month, in the reactionary camp all over the world, from the most arrogant head (the United States) to the most despicable clown (Greece), they are all frantically attacking the progressive forces, attacking democracy, and attacking the basic rights of the people; their panicked, unscrupulous, stupid and brutal actions can only be issued by a dying beast in such a desperate struggle.

　　This is a picture presented to the world on the eve of the thirty-second anniversary of the great Soviet "October Revolution." The people's democratic forces are unprecedentedly strong, and the strength of the imperialist reactionary groups is unprecedentedly weakened. The occurrence and growth of this contrast between revolutionary and counter-revolutionary forces that is favorable to the revolution cannot but originate from the Soviet "October Revolution" that shook the world thirty-two years ago.

　　This is why people all over the world celebrate with unparalleled enthusiasm the annual grand event in human history, the "October Revolution" festival.

　　In our China, this year's "October Revolution" festival has a particularly strong reason for the whole country to celebrate together. For a hundred years, the Chinese people, under the cruel oppression of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, have seen the path of their struggle from the "October Revolution" and strengthened their confidence in victory. And today, thanks to the wise leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese people have finally defeated the internal and external reactionary forces and achieved the final victory. Without the "October Revolution," there could not have been today's great success of the Chinese people's revolution. Therefore, after warmly celebrating the establishment of the People's Republic of China and the establishment of the Central People's Government, we must also celebrate with the same enthusiasm the "October Revolution" anniversary of our great ally, the Soviet Union.

　　In the long-term struggle, the Chinese people have received a lot of friendly assistance from the Soviet Union and have learned valuable experiences and lessons from the Soviet Union. In the future, in the process of building a new democracy, the Chinese people will also cherish the friendship and assistance of the Soviet people and the valuable experiences and lessons of the Soviet people in the thirty-two years of great construction. Just as we saw our own path from the success of the Soviet revolution and strengthened our confidence in victory, we will also stabilize our steps and strengthen our confidence in victory from the success of the great Soviet construction. And just as we achieved a great victory in the Liberation War, we will also achieve great victories in future economic and cultural construction.

　　In the face of the great victory of the Chinese people's revolution and the unprecedentedly strong people's democratic forces all over the world, the imperialist reactionary groups are trembling! However, they are going to make a desperate struggle. They are frantically provoking new wars and using all kinds of conspiracies and tricks in a despicable and insidious way. We must be vigilant, but we don't need to panic. The two great nations of China and the Soviet Union, plus the new democratic countries of Eastern Europe, this united force will be invincible! The remaining Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang pinned their last hope on a new world war, but the world's peaceful and democratic forces led by the Soviet Union will surely make the imperialists dare not act rashly. The celebration of the "October Revolution" festival by the people all over the world is, in a sense, a general review of the people's democratic forces and a demonstration to the imperialist reactionary groups. Let us shout:

　　Long live the great Soviet Union, the bastion of peace and democracy!

　　Long live Marshal Stalin, the mentor of the progressive people of the world!

　　在十月革命前，反动派疯狂而发抖了！
    茅盾
    【新华社北京六日电】茅盾于中苏友好月刊创刊号发表论文，题为：在十月革命前，反动派疯狂而发抖了！全文如下：
    一个月来，全世界人民（包括中国人民在内）以无限的愤怒，抗议美帝国主义的为华尔街服务的纽约联邦法院对于美共十一位领袖的非法判决，抗议澳洲的所谓工党政府对于澳共领袖的同样无耻的压迫，抗议英美帝国主义走狗希腊的傀儡政权惨无人道地杀害民主进步人士的血腥罪行。
    人们看得明明白白：一个月来在全世界的反动阵营内，从最骄悍的头目（美国）到最卑劣的小丑（希腊），都是疯狂地向进步势力进攻，向民主进攻，向人民的基本权利进攻；它们那种慌张失措，不择手段，愚蠢而横暴的行动，只有濒于死亡的野兽才会发出这样绝望的挣扎。
    这就是伟大的苏联“十月革命”三十二周年纪念前夕呈现于世界的一幅图景。人民民主力量是空前地强大了，帝国主义反动集团的力量是空前地削弱了，而这一切的革命与反革命力量的有利于革命的对比之所以发生而成长，又不能不导源于三十二年前震动世界的苏联“十月革命”。
    这就是为什么全世界人民以无比的热忱来庆贺每年一度的人类历史上的盛典“十月革命”节。
    在我们中国，对于今年的“十月革命”节，特别有其举国狂欢同申庆祝的原因。百年以来，在帝国主义，封建主义和官僚资本主义残酷压迫之下的中国人民，曾从“十月革命”看见了自己斗争的道路，坚定了胜利的信心。而今天，由于伟大领袖毛泽东主席的英明领导，中国人民终于战胜了内外的反动势力，取得了最后的胜利。没有“十月革命”，就不可能有中国人民革命今天的伟大成功。因此，我们在热烈地庆祝中华人民共和国的建立，庆祝中央人民政府的成立以后，也要以同样的热忱来庆祝我们伟大的友邦苏联的“十月革命”纪念节。
    中国人民在长期的斗争中，曾经从苏联得到大量的友谊的援助，曾经从苏联学取了宝贵的经验和教训。今后中国人民在新民主主义的建设过程中，也要同样地珍视苏联人民的友谊的援助以及苏联人民在三十二年伟大的建设中宝贵的经验和教训。正如我们从苏联革命的成功中看见了自己的道路，坚定了胜利的信心一样，我们也将从苏联伟大建设的成功中，稳扎住自己的步骤，坚定了胜利的信心。而且正如在解放战争中我们取得了伟大的胜利一样，在今后的经济和文化建设中我们也将取得伟大的胜利。
    在中国人民革命伟大胜利的面前，在全世界人民民主力量空前强大的面前，帝国主义反动集团是在发抖了！然而他们是要作垂死的挣扎的。他们在疯狂地挑拨新的战争，在卑鄙阴险地使用各种阴谋诡计。我们要提高警惕，然而我们用不到惊慌恐惧。中苏两大民族，再加上东欧的新民主主义国家，这联合起来的力量，将是无敌的！残余的蒋介石匪帮把他们最后一线的希望寄托在新的世界战争，然而以苏联为首的全世界和平民主的力量，必将使帝国主义者不敢轻举妄动。全世界人民的庆祝“十月革命”节，在某种意义上，也是人民民主力量的总检阅，是对于帝国主义反动集团的示威。让我们高呼：
    伟大的和平民主堡垒苏联万岁！
    世界进步人民的导师斯大林大元师万岁！
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　一九四九、十一月三日北京
