　　On the Bridge
    ——A Story of Lenin
    The armed uprising began at night.
    The night sky was dark, somber, and frightening. The streetlights were not lit. The Bolshevik cruiser "Aurora" loomed dark and menacing on the Neva River. The ship's lights were all extinguished, and the cannon muzzles were pointed at the Winter Palace.

    In the darkness, distant gunshots could be heard, along with the sound of motorcycles and the rumble of large trucks filled with armed soldiers and sailors speeding through the streets.

    Fires were burning in the streets. Red Guards warmed themselves by the fires, talking in low voices, waiting for orders to attack. At that moment, armed workers' detachments had already occupied the bridges over the Neva River.

    On one of the bridges stood a young Petrograd worker, Krudov. Eight other Red Guards were with him, protecting the bridge. They were commanded by an old Bolshevik, known to everyone as Vasily Ivanovich.

    On that night, the White Army had attacked the bridge twice, but the Red Guards stood their ground, firing and repelling them.

    Only those with special passes were allowed to cross the bridge.

    However, one man without a pass was eventually allowed to pass. As he approached the sentries, Vasily Ivanovich stepped forward with his pistol in hand. He sternly asked:

    ——Show me your pass! The man stopped and pushed back the high collar of his coat. His cheeks were tightly wrapped in a scarf. He whispered a word to Vasily Ivanovich. Vasily Ivanovich stepped back and gave him a salute. The man with the scarf quickly walked past Krudov on the bridge and disappeared into the darkness.

    The sentry leader returned to his post and stood shoulder to shoulder with Krudov. He didn't say a word, always looking in the direction the stranger had gone. Faint gunfire could be heard from the other side of the river.

    Finally, Krudov couldn't help but ask:

    ——Did he show you a pass?

    Vasily Ivanovich slowly replied:

    ——No. He didn't have time to get a pass. He's been hiding all the time... first in Finland, and now here. Now he's going to Smolny. [Note: Smolny Institute]

    Then he added:

    ——Just think: he came past the White Army! They could have... you understand? They could have killed him.

    Krudov felt that even his voice was trembling with fear. This was the first time he had heard his commander speak like this.

    He looked at Vasily Ivanovich's face and asked:

    ——Who is he, anyway?

    The Red Guard sentry leader replied:

    ——He is Lenin.

　　在桥上
    ——列宁的故事
    武装起义是在夜间开始的。
    当夜天色沉黑，森严可怕。街上的路灯都没有亮。布尔塞维克的巡洋舰“阿芙乐尔”黑森森的耸立在涅瓦河上。舰上的灯光都熄灭了，大炮口对着冬宫。
    在黑暗中，传来了远处的枪声，摩托车声和站满了武装兵士和水兵的大汽车在大街上飞驰的轰隆声。
    各街上都燃着火堆。赤卫队员在火堆前烤火，低声谈话，等待命令去进攻。此刻武装的工人队伍已经占领了涅瓦河上的各桥梁。
    在一座桥上站有一个彼得格拉的年轻工人克鲁多夫。还有八个赤卫队员同他一块保护这座桥。指挥他们的是一个老布尔塞维克，大家都称他为瓦西里·依万诺维奇。
    在那天夜里，白军曾两次进攻这座桥，但是赤卫队员坚守不退，开枪把他们击退了。
    除非是带有特别通行证的人才可以从桥上通过。
    可是有一个人没有通行证，终于也让他过去了。当他走到哨兵跟前时，瓦西里·依万诺维奇拿着手枪走上前去。厉声问道：
    ——拿出通行证来！那个人站下了，把竖起的大衣领子推开。他的面颊上紧紧扎着一条手巾。他低声向瓦西里·依万诺维奇说了一句话。瓦西里·依万诺维奇就往后一退，向他行了一个举手礼。那个脸上扎手巾的人就迅速从桥上的克鲁多夫面前走过去，隐没在黑暗中不见了。
    哨兵长回到自己的岗位上来同克鲁多夫并肩站着。他一句话也没有说，总是望着那个生人走去的方向。在河那边不时传来隐约的枪声。
    最后，克鲁多夫忍不住了，问道：
    ——他拿出通行证给你看了么？
    瓦西里·依万诺维奇慢慢答道：
    ——没有。他没有来得及领通行证。他时常都在躲藏着……先是藏在芬兰，然后又藏在这里。现在他到斯莫尔雷去了。（注：士摩伦宫）
    随后他又说道：
    ——你想一想：他是从白军跟前走过来的！他们能把他……你明白吗？他们能把他打死的。
    克鲁多夫觉得连他的说话声音都有些战栗害怕。这是他第一次听见他长官这样说话的声音。
    他看一看瓦西里·依万诺维奇的面色问道：
    ——究竟他是什么人？
    赤卫队哨兵长答道：
    ——他是列宁。
