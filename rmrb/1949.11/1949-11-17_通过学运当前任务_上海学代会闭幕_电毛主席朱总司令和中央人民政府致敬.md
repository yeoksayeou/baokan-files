　　Through the Current Tasks of the Student Movement
  　Shanghai Student Congress Concludes
    Sends Respects to Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and the Central People's Government
    [Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 15th] The First Shanghai Student Representative Congress was held from the 10th to the 14th. After repeated discussions, the Congress approved the Shanghai Student Federation Executive Committee's "Five-Month Work Report on the Shanghai Student Movement," adopted the "Current Tasks of the Shanghai Student Movement" resolution and the "Shanghai Student Federation Charter." It also elected 37 school units, including Fudan University, Jiaotong University, Tongji University, and Gezhi Middle School, as the Second Executive Committee of the Shanghai Student Federation. During the discussion of the current tasks of the Shanghai student movement, the presidium invited teachers and educational authorities from various schools to a forum to solicit opinions. The resolution on the current tasks of the Shanghai student movement pointed out that the current Shanghai students should not only continue to actively participate in the struggle against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism to consolidate and develop the victories already gained, but also step up their studies and participate in the construction of the new China. Therefore, the specific tasks of Shanghai students are: students unite, teachers and students unite, implement the new democratic education policy, carry out the new democratic study movement, and assist the People's Government in overcoming difficulties and struggle for the construction of a new Shanghai. During the conference, Rao Shushi, Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Li Chang, Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Working Committee of the New Democratic Youth League, were invited to speak, and Chinese youth representatives attending the World Youth Congress gave reports. On the last day of the conference, Mayor Chen Yi attended and delivered a speech. He congratulated all the representatives and the complete success of the Student Congress, and encouraged the students to study hard after returning to school. Mayor Chen then explained current affairs.
    The Congress also adopted a telegram of respect to Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and the Central People's Government, and a telegram to the All-China Student Federation reporting the results of the meeting. The telegram to Chairman Mao stated: "Our ability to hold this conference so freely is entirely due to the victory of the Chinese revolution under your wise leadership. We represent 118,000 students in expressing our most sincere respect and gratitude to you, and we assure you that we will resolutely uphold the Common Program implemented by the Central People's Government under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, step up the study of new democracy, and strive to build a new Shanghai and a new China." The telegram to Commander-in-Chief Zhu stated: "We represent 118,000 students in unanimously assuring you that we will resolutely support the People's Liberation Army, fight to Taiwan, liberate all of China, and step up the study of new democracy to strive for the construction of a new China and the consolidation of national defense." The telegram to the Central People's Government stated: "We 118,000 students resolutely support the Central People's Government and its program of governance. We will step up our studies under the new democratic education policy to strive to cultivate ourselves into useful talents for the construction of new democracy."
