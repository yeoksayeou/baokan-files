　　The Three-Wheel Workers' Cooperative of the Third and Fourth Streets of the Third District of Beijing:
  　Careless Appointment of Cadres Leads to Collective Embezzlement;
    Municipal General Cooperative Accepts Members' Opinions and Handles Cases Separately

    [Our Newspaper] The collective embezzlement case in the Three-Wheel Workers' Cooperative of the Third and Fourth Streets of the Third District of Beijing should serve as a warning to cooperative cadres throughout the city. The cooperative was established at the end of July when grain prices fluctuated. Due to the urgency of the situation, cadres were not democratically elected according to the cooperative's establishment procedures. After Director Wang Xiwu took office, he first borrowed grain from the cooperative under the pretext of financial difficulties, and other cadres followed suit. Subsequently, Wang Xiwu and other cadres conspired to violate the cooperative's charter by selling grain to non-members at high prices, and the extra money was divided among themselves, a total of four times, with each person receiving 5,100 yuan. In order to further carry out planned embezzlement, he also made a set of uniforms for the cooperative's accountant, and each cadre was given 45 jin of ground flour and buckwheat, etc. They sold the grain to processing shops or non-members, and used 45 jin of the cooperative's grain for their own use, totaling 2,104 jin.

    Finally, Zhao Yongfu, who wrote small receipts for the cooperative, disagreed with Wang Xiwu and feared that Wang would replace him, so he exposed this scandal. A thorough audit revealed that in the fifty days since the opening, the cooperative had lost more than 4,900 jin of food, more than 400 boxes of cigarettes, half a dozen towels, and six toothbrushes. Currently, the Municipal General Cooperative, the District Office, and the District Trade Union have accepted the members' opinions, announced the dismissal of the accountant, and are investigating Wang, and have submitted the case to the People's Court for trial.

　　京三区三、四街三轮工人合作社
  　任用干部不慎发生集体贪污
    市总社已接受社员意见分别处理
    【本报讯】京市三区三、四街三轮工人合作社，发生集体贪污案，值得全市合作干部警惕。该合作社是在七月底粮价波动时成立的，因时间仓促没有按照建社步骤，民主选举干部。主任王锡五自到任后，首先借口生活困难，向社里借粮食，其他干部也仿效这种作法。随后王锡五又和干部商量，违犯社章，高价卖粮食给非社员，多卖的钱大家平分，共分四次，每人分了五千一百元。为了更进一步有计划的贪污，他又给该社会计作了一套制服，每个干部分给伏地面、荞麦等四十五斤。他们把粮食卖给加工店或非社员，并把社内粮食自己支用四十五斤共两千一百零四斤。
    最后因该社写小票的赵永福和王锡五意见不合，害怕王撤换他，才揭露了这一黑幕。经彻底查帐结果，在开业的五十天中，竞亏了食粮四千九百多斤，纸烟四百多盒，毛巾半打，牙刷六枝。现市总社、区公所、区工会已接受社员意见，宣布会计撤职，王某查办，并送交人民法院审理。　　（郑重）
