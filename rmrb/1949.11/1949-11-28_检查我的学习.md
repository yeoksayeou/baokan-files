　　Checking My Learning
    Wei Qun
    In the past, I was a law student, always believing that law was the most sacred, unrelated to politics, transcending all classes, and the fairest norm for human behavior, with everyone equal before the law. I thought that the abolition of the "Six Codes" focused on its political role, and that a "Six Codes" that was largely the same would be formulated and applied in the same way in the future. Now I understand that law, like the state, has class character. Law is part of the political power and is supported by the political power. The ruling class formulates certain laws to protect the order that conforms to its own class interests, as a tool to oppress the ruled class: first using force to suppress, and then writing some legal provisions for everyone to abide by. We can see from history that the laws of the slave era stipulated that killing slaves was not a crime; the laws of the feudal era did not apply to the aristocracy, the so-called "leniency for officials"; the laws of the bourgeois era stipulated that private property was sacred and inviolable, and imprisonment could be replaced by fines. Those who were executed and imprisoned were all poor people, and farmers who did not pay rent were committing a crime. Super-economic exploitation was considered legal and guaranteed. In the past, dynasties changed until the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, and the laws were largely the same and inherited in one continuous line, because it was just one form of exploitation replacing another form of exploitation, one exploiting class replacing another exploiting class. Now that the majority of people are in power, and the people have become the rulers, the shackles that bound the people in the past will of course no longer be allowed to remain and be put on their own heads. Instead, laws that are for the people, can be mastered by the people, and are used by the people, and a judicial system that meets the needs of the people must be formulated to protect and consolidate the interests of the people, and ruthlessly suppress all reactionary forces, so that the laws that served the minority in the past become laws that serve the majority. In the transformation of my understanding of the law, it can be seen that the old legal thinking cannot be abolished by a single order. We must review it in connection with political theory in order to eradicate all the influence of the old law that we have been subjected to in the past. From then on, I began to realize that law is subordinate to politics, and a certain level of political understanding is a prerequisite for learning the people's law. My doubts about "why engage in political learning all the time" were dispelled, and from now on I will consciously study political knowledge.
    Originally, when I saw or thought of democratic centralism, I always thought that it was not as truly democratic as the old democratic system. After classmates raised discussions in group meetings and I studied it repeatedly, I realized that my past concepts were completely wrong; I realized that democratic centralism is an application of dialectics. In the constant movement back and forth between democracy and centralism, the crystallization of the opinions of the masses becomes the opinion of the leadership. The leaders are integrated into the masses, so that the masses know everything and say everything. The good opinions of the masses are collected without any omissions, and unsuitable opinions and doubts can be clearly explained. Everyone has no suspicion and no estrangement, and naturally tends to be consistent and united. The power of the masses can be fully exerted. The CPPCC uses democratic centralism, so everything achieves a high degree of democracy and a high degree of centralism. This change in understanding made me shake off the stubbornness of burying myself in books. I deeply felt that without in-depth research, the understanding of things would not be correct. Very ordinary, common, and simple things often contain great problems. From now on, I should grasp every learning object, conduct rigorous research, and apply theoretical knowledge to the understanding of specific things I see and hear.
    The second is the issue of the "united front." My previous understanding was vague. I thought that the Anti-Japanese National United Front was led by the Kuomintang, and that the Communist Party later imitated this method to deal with the Kuomintang because it was weak. Until now, after listening to Principal Xie's repeated and detailed report, I realized that the "united front" must have a distinction between "enemy" and "us," that is, everyone works together to fight against a common enemy. Imperialism, feudalism, and warlord-bureaucratism are the enemies of the Chinese people. Since 1921, when the Communist Party represented the Chinese people, it put forward this "united front" requirement to fight against the three major enemies. In 1925, Sun Yat-sen accepted this requirement and achieved the success of the Northern Expedition. Later, Chiang Kai-shek betrayed, and the Communist Party still adhered to this "united front." By 1937, in the Xi'an Incident, Chiang Kai-shek was forced to accept the "Anti-Japanese National United Front," but Chiang Kai-shek's ambition was never extinguished. He deliberately split, passively resisted Japan, and actively prevented communism. Only the Communist Party truly led the entire nation, striking and containing the enemy in northern Shaanxi, the Yellow River, and behind enemy lines to achieve the final victory. It can be seen that the actual leader of the "united front" task is still the Communist Party—this is also the Communist Party's consistent and inevitable proposition, because everything the Communist Party does is based on the interests of the people. From the above two changes in understanding, I further realized the greatness of the Communist Party and affirmed that the future of the new China under the leadership of the Communist Party must be glorious and happy. It has inspired my high interest in life, life, learning, and work, and because of my heartfelt belief in the Communist Party, I have begun to look forward to the day when I can gloriously join the vanguard of Chinese democratic youth—the New Democratic Youth League.
    Also, I used to think that it was imperfect that the organizational law did not stipulate that the Central People's Government was responsible to which agency, and that the Common Program did not stipulate the people's right to recall and referendum. Now I know that my old thinking is at work. The constitutional principles of European and American capitalist countries that I learned in the past pay attention to formal democracy, while we pay attention to actual democracy. Democracy is not the goal, but to achieve benefits for the people. As long as it meets the requirements of the public and is supported by the people, the content and form have actually taken a step forward. It will never be clear to understand new things by measuring them with old ideas. From now on, I must jump out of the old circle to critically understand old things and look at new things, in order to be able to actively and correctly estimate the truth and falsehood of all things, and to "negate the first three axes and start learning from scratch."

    我过去是一个念法律的学生，一向认为法律是最神圣的，与政治无关，超乎一切阶级之上，作为人类行为最公正的规范，人人在法律面前平等。我以为废除“六法全书”是着重在政治方面的作用，将来还会制定一部大同小异的“六法全书”来照样应用。现在才明了法律也与国家一样是有阶级性的，法律是政权之一部分而也靠政权来支持，统治阶级为了保护符合于它自己阶级利益的秩序而制定一定的法律，作为一种压迫被统治阶级的工具：先用武力镇压，再写些法律条文要大家遵守。我们可以从历史上看到：奴隶时代的法律，杀奴隶没有罪；封建时代的法律，贵族管不着，即所谓“刑不上大夫”；资产阶级时代的法律，私人财产神圣不可侵犯，徒刑可以罚金代替，杀头坐牢的尽是穷人，农民不缴租就是犯了法，超经济的剥削被认为是合法而得到保障的。过去易朝换代一直到国民党反动统治时期，法律都是大同小异，一脉相承的，因为那只是一种剥削方式一个剥削阶级代替另一种剥削方式另一个剥削阶级。现在是大多数人当了权，人民做了统治者，过去那一束缚人民的枷锁当然不再让它留着来套在自己头上了，而必须另外制定为人民所有为人民所能掌握为人民所用的法律和适合人民需要的司法制度，来保障和巩固人民利益，并无情的镇压一切反动势力，使过去为少数人服务的法律变成为多数人服务。在我对法律的认识的转变中，可见旧法律思想不是一个命令能废得掉的，必须联系政治理论来时加检讨，才能铲除一切过去所受的旧法律的影响。从此我开始认识了法律是服从政治的，一定的政治水平是学习人民法律的先决条件，我的“为什么要尽搞政治学习”的疑惑戳破了，今后我将自觉地去学习政治知识了。
    原先我看到或想到民主集中制时，总是以为不如旧的民主制度那样真正民主，经过同学在小组会提出讨论和自己再三研习后，才知道过去观念大错特错；才知道民主集中制是辩证法的一种运用。在民主和集中来回不断的运动中，使群众的意见底结晶变为领导的意见。领导者结合于群众当中，使群众知无不言，言无不尽，群众的好意见被搜集无遗，不适合的意见和疑虑可获得明白的解释，大家无猜忌、无隔阂，自然趋于一致、团结无间了，群众的力量得以充分发挥。人民政协运用了民主集中制，所以一切都获得高度的民主和高度的集中。从这一认识的转变，使我动摇了埋首书本的固执性，我深深感到没有深刻的研究，对事物的认识是不会正确的，很平常普通而简单的事物往往存在着很大的问题。今后我当抓住每一学习的对象，作严密的研究，把理论知识应用到所见所闻的具体事物的了解上去了。
    其次是关于“统一战线”问题。我以前的认识是模糊的，我以为抗日民族统一战线是国民党领导的，共产党后来因势单力薄，模仿这办法来对付国民党，直到现在，听过谢校长的反复详细的报告后，我才知道“统一战线”必有“敌”“我”之分，即大家齐心一意向共同的敌人作斗争。帝国主义、封建主义、军阀官僚主义就是中国人民的敌人。自一九二一年共产党代表了中国人民即提出了这一与三大敌人斗争的“统一战线”的要求。一九二五年孙中山接受这一要求，获得北伐的成功，后来蒋介石叛离了，共产党仍坚持这“统一战线”。到一九三七年西安事变蒋介石被迫接受“抗日民族统一战线”，不过蒋介石始终野心未泯，蓄意分裂，消极抗日，积极防共，惟有共产党才真正领导全民族，在陕北黄河和敌后打击和牵制敌人而获得最后的胜利，可见“统一战线”的任务实际上的领导者还是共产党——这也是共产党一贯的必然的主张，因为共产党一切都是以人民的利益为着眼点的。从以上二种认识的转变中，我进一步的认识了共产党的伟大，肯定了在共产党领导下的新中国的前途必然是辉煌和幸福的，鼓舞了我对人生对生活对学习对工作的高度兴趣，更因由衷的信仰共产党而使我开始盼望着能有一天光荣地加入中国民主青年的先锋队——新民主主义青年团。
    还有我以前看到组织法中没有规定中央人民政府对那一机关负责、共同纲领中也未规定人民的罢免权和复决权，总认为不完善，认为人民无法掌握自己的权利。现在我才知道是我的旧思想在作崇，以前所学的欧美资本主义国家的宪法原理是注重形式的民主，而我们是注重实际上的民主，民主不是目的，是要达到对人民有利益，只要合乎大众要求，受人民支持的做法，内容和形式实际上都已向前发展了一步。拿旧思想来衡量新事物，决不会清楚的了解。今后我必须跳出旧的圈子来批判地认识旧的事情，来看新的事情。以求能主动的正确的估定一切事物的真假，并且要“否定前三斧，从头学起”了。
