　　International Week
  　　　　　Asian and Australian Working Class Representatives Meet Triumphantly in New China
    The Asian and Australian Trade Union Conference, long awaited by the working people of the world, grandly opened on the 16th in Beijing, the capital of New China. Another Asian Women's Representative Conference of equal significance will also be held in Beijing on December 6th. The convocation of these two major international events in New China is the result of the great victory of the Chinese people's revolution and the vigorous development of the progressive workers' movements and national liberation movements in Asia and Australia. The ongoing Asian and Australian Trade Union Conference is a conference of great unity among the working classes of Asia and Australia, as well as their great unity with the working classes of the whole world. This conference is being held under the direct leadership of the World Federation of Trade Unions Executive Bureau. This indicates that the World Federation of Trade Unions has taken important practical steps to strengthen its ties with the working classes of Asian and Australian countries. It also indicates that the working classes of Asian and Australian countries are further uniting to strengthen the struggle against imperialism and feudal forces, and against national traitors in various countries. The participants in this conference include representatives of the working classes from various countries in Asia and Australia. According to the conference agenda, the main tasks of this conference are to exchange information and experiences regarding the struggles of the working classes in Asia and Australia, establish a World Federation of Trade Unions Asia-Australia Liaison Bureau, strengthen the unity of the working classes throughout Asia and Australia, and further develop the struggle of the Asian and Australian working classes for lasting peace, people's democracy, and national liberation. This conference severely strikes at the imperialist conspiracy to deliberately weaken, split, and undermine the unity of the working classes of Asian and Australian countries. For many years, the workers of Asia and Australia have groaned under heavy oppression and exploitation, waging heroic and tenacious struggles in a scattered manner. Now, they have triumphantly converged on the free land of New China, the largest country in Asia! This conference marks a new milestone in the Asian and Australian workers' movement, as well as the Asian and Australian people's liberation movement. The working classes of the whole world and the working class of the whole of China are cheering for this unity conference, warmly wishing it success and regarding its being held in our capital as an honor.
    Recently, the national democratic movements of the Eastern peoples have continued to surge. The flames of guerrilla warfare in South Korea have spread throughout the country. Especially in the two provinces of North Jeolla and South Jeolla in southwestern South Korea, the activities of the people's guerrillas have become increasingly active. In mid-to-late October, the people's guerrillas successively attacked many county towns, including Naju, Jangheung, Gwangju, and Gokseong in South Jeolla Province, and launched fierce street battles with the puppet National Defense Forces. In North Gyeongsang and South Gyeongsang Provinces in southeastern South Korea, as well as North Chungcheong and South Chungcheong Provinces in central South Korea, the activities of the people's guerrillas are also expanding daily. At the same time, the combat effectiveness of the guerrillas is also strengthening day by day. For example, the guerrillas in Sunchang County, North Jeolla Province, annihilated more than 540 puppet troops and police in a three-hour battle on October 9th. The victorious development of guerrilla warfare has greatly inspired the fighting spirit of the South Korean people. On October 29th, more than 7,500 farmers in Tanyang and Nogwang counties in northern South Jeolla Province launched a large-scale armed uprising, coordinated with the guerrillas to liquidate reactionary landlords, distribute land, and liberate many villages in the two counties. Currently, the armed uprisings of South Korean farmers are developing towards various parts of North Jeolla and South Jeolla Provinces. Under this situation, the internal structure of the South Korean puppet government is increasingly disintegrating, and incidents of uprisings by puppet troops are increasing. Following the uprisings of a detachment of the puppet National Defense Forces, a puppet National Defense warship, and an air force plane in September, more than 300 puppet National Defense soldiers gloriously raised the banner of uprising on October 27th and joined the people's guerrillas. At present, American imperialism is vainly attempting to save the increasingly unstable reactionary rule of its puppet Syngman Rhee. The US Congress has passed $27 million as "military aid" to Syngman Rhee, the Philippines, and Iran.
    The Vietnamese people's war of self-defense against French imperialism is continuing to persist and expand. In the first half of this year alone, Vietnamese guerrillas fought 672 battles between Hanoi and Haiphong, killing or wounding 1,500 French invading troops. At the mass rally celebrating the founding of the People's Republic of China at the end of last month, Viet Minh General Secretary Hoang Quoc Viet called on the Vietnamese people to "emulate the Chinese people and actively prepare for a general counter-offensive."
    In Indonesia, the Indonesian people are launching guerrilla warfare to oppose the treacherous agreement signed by the Hatta clique at the Hague Round Table Conference, which sold out Indonesia to American and Dutch imperialism. Recently, the activities of the people's guerrillas in Java and Sulawesi have been strengthened.
    　　　　People from All Walks of Life in China Warmly Support Expelling the Kuomintang Remnant Bandits from the United Nations
    On the 15th of this month, Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai of our country sent a telegram to UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie and Romulo, the President of the current UN General Assembly, stating that the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China does not recognize the legal status of the Chiang Ting-fu delegation dispatched by the so-called "Chinese Nationalist Government" in the UN General Assembly, and demands the immediate cancellation of all rights of this "delegation" to continue to represent the Chinese people in the United Nations. This solemn statement fully conforms to the wishes of the Chinese people and has won the warm support and endorsement of people from all walks of life in China. The Kuomintang reactionary government stole the fruits of the Chinese people's victory, and therefore stole the Chinese people's position and rights in the United Nations, acting as an echo of imperialism on the international stage, swindling and deceiving, and doing all kinds of evil, which has long been despised by the Chinese people and the progressive people of the world. Now, the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China has been established, and has been warmly supported by the progressive people of the world and the entire Chinese people. The Kuomintang reactionary government has declared its demise, and its remaining forces will soon be eliminated. It has obviously completely lost any factual and legal basis to represent the Chinese people. Therefore, all those who approve of the UN Charter and uphold the dignity of the United Nations should endorse our government's request to kick the representatives of the Kuomintang remnant bandits out of the United Nations!
    　　　　American Imperialism Openly Opposes Soviet Peaceful Proposals Revealing the True Colors of War-Mongers Once Again
    The Fourth Session of the UN General Assembly has been in session since its opening on September 20th, lasting two months so far. Up until now, the issues that have been discussed by the subcommittees include the so-called "problem of human rights and fundamental freedoms being violated by Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania," "the Greek question," "the problem of approving new member states," and "the problem of international control of atomic energy." Under the manipulation of the American and British groups' majority, the reactionary motions that have been discussed and passed by the subcommittees include "the Korean question," "the problem of former Italian colonies," and "the problem of approving new member states." The reactionary motion passed by the General Assembly after discussion is the Tito clique taking the non-permanent seat on the Security Council. During the discussion or passing of these motions, the representatives of the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries firmly defended the UN Charter, protected the rights of small and weak nations, and defended world peace, giving the imperialist aggressors a head-on blow, thoroughly exposing the ugly faces of the American and British groups that are destroying the UN, brutally interfering in the internal affairs of countries like Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, and Korea, shamelessly dividing up the former Italian colonies, and engaging in wars of aggression. Starting from the 14th, the UN Political Committee has started discussing the motion put forward by the Soviet delegation "regarding condemning new war preparations, banning atomic weapons, and concluding a five-power pact to strengthen peace." The head of the Soviet delegation, Vyshinsky, delivered a long speech, proposing to condemn the new war preparations being carried out in certain countries, especially the United States and Britain, calling for a ban on atomic weapons and the establishment of strict international control, and demanding that the five permanent members of the Security Council conclude a pact to strengthen peace in order to guarantee lasting world peace. However, the American representative openly opposed the Soviet peaceful proposals, revealing the true colors of American imperialist war-mongers here once again.
    　　　　American Imperialism Fosters the Revival of German and Japanese Militarism The Chinese People Resolutely Oppose This Conspiracy
    In addition to engaging in various acts of aggression at the United Nations, the international reactionaries, headed by American imperialism, have recently stepped up their conspiracy to revive German and Japanese militarism, attempting to completely turn Germany and Japan into central bases for their outward expansion and aggression in order to save their imperialist policies that have already suffered major failures and their increasingly serious economic crisis. After holding a series of meetings (such as the US Ambassadors to Europe Conference, the "European Economic Cooperation Bureau" Council Meeting, and the "Council of Europe" Ministerial Meeting), the Western imperialist group held a meeting of the three foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France in Paris from the 9th to the 10th of this month. At this meeting, Britain and France further succumbed to their American master, agreeing to the West German puppet joining the "Council of Europe" under American leadership, paving the way for West Germany to participate in the North Atlantic Alliance; ceasing the dismantling of West Germany and the Ruhr area; allowing the United States to control German war industry; and allowing West Germany to send consuls abroad, etc. American imperialism wants to quickly foster the West German puppet in this way, so as to turn it into the center of a "politically and economically integrated" Western Europe, using it to invade Europe and prepare for new war adventures.
    At the same time, American imperialism is also playing its trick of unilaterally concluding a peace treaty with Japan. According to US Deputy Secretary of State Webb's admission on the 9th, the peace treaty to be signed separately by the US-British group and Japan "is being drafted by the US State Department and other relevant departments." The purpose of this "peace treaty" drafted by the United States is to "concentrate American interests in the Far East on Japan, which is the main strategic fortress" (Associated Press). This means that the United States is attempting to use this "treaty" to turn Japan into a military base for American aggression in the Far East. To this end, according to the Associated Press, the United States plans to "simultaneously conclude a military treaty stipulating the bases to be retained in Japan after the end of the occupation" when it unilaterally concludes a peace treaty with Japan. This approach by American imperialism will enable Japanese militarism to be revived under American support and is a threat to peace in the Far East and world peace. The Chinese people, who have sacrificed the most and suffered the greatest losses in the War of Resistance Against Japan, resolutely oppose this shameful conspiracy of imperialism. The peace treaty with Japan must be prepared by the foreign ministers' conference of China, the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States. Any peace treaty with Japan signed without the participation of the representative of the Chinese people -- the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China -- will be invalid.

　　国际一周
  　　　　　亚澳工人阶级代表在新中国胜利会师
    世界劳动人民渴望已久的亚洲澳洲工会会议，已于十六日在新中国首都北京隆重揭幕，另一个具有同样重要意义的亚洲妇女代表会议，也将于十二月六日在北京举行。这两大国际盛会能在新中国召开，是中国人民革命获得伟大胜利的结果，是亚洲、澳洲进步的工人运动和民族解放运动强大开展的结果。正在进行中的亚澳工会会议，是亚澳两洲工人阶级大团结以及它们与全世界工人阶级大团结的会议。这一会议是在世界工会联合会执行局直接领导之下举行的。这表示世界工联已采取重要的实际步骤，来加强它和亚澳各国工人阶级的联系，也表示亚澳各国工人阶级进一步团结起来，加强反对帝国主义和封建势力，反对各国民族叛徒的斗争。参加这个会议的，包括了亚澳两洲各个国家的工人阶级代表。根据会议的议程，这次会议的主要任务，在于交换亚澳各国工人阶级的斗争情况和经验，成立世界工联亚澳联络局，加强全亚澳两洲工人阶级的团结，进一步展开亚澳工人阶级为持久和平、人民民主与民族解放的斗争。这次会议严重地打击帝国主义蓄意削弱、分裂和破坏亚澳各国工人阶级团结的阴谋。亚澳各国工人，多少年来呻吟于重重压迫和剥削下，分散地各自进行了英勇顽强的斗争，现在已经在亚洲最大的国度——新中国的自由土地上胜利会师了！这次会议，是亚澳工人运动，也是亚澳人民解放运动新发展的里程碑。全世界工人阶级和全中国的工人阶级都为这个团结大会而欢呼，热烈地预祝它的成功。并对这次会议之在我国首都举行引为荣誉。
    最近，东方人民的民族民主运动正在继续高涨。南朝鲜游击战争的烽火已遍及全境，特别在南朝鲜西南部的全罗北道和全罗南道两省，人民游击队的活动已愈来愈积极。十月中下旬，人民游击队曾先后攻入全罗南道的罗州、长兴光州、谷城等许多县城，并和伪国防军展开了激烈的巷战。在南朝鲜东南部的庆尚北道与庆尚南道，以及中部的忠清北道与忠清南道，人民游击队的活动也日益扩大。同时，游击队的战斗力也一天天地加强了。例如全罗北道淳昌县地区的游击队，在十月九日的三小时战斗中，将伪军警五百四十余名全部歼灭。游击战争的胜利发展，大大鼓舞了南朝鲜人民的斗志。全罗南道北部的谭阳和露光两县的七千五百多农民，于十月二十九日举行了大规模的武装起义、协同游击队清算反动地主，分配土地，并解放了该两县的许多村庄。现在南朝鲜农民的武装起义正向全罗北道、全罗南道各地发展中。在这种形势下，南朝鲜傀儡政府内部正日益分崩离析，伪军的起义事件日益增多。继伪国防军一个分队、伪国防舰艇一艘和空军飞机一架于九月间先后起义后，伪国防军三百余人又于十月二十七日光荣地举起义旗，参加了人民游击队。目前，美帝国主义正妄图挽救其傀儡李承晚日益不稳的反动统治。美国会已通过二千七百万美元，作为对李承晚、菲律宾和伊朗的“军事援助”。
    越南人民反抗法帝国主义的自卫战争，正继续坚持与扩张中。今年半年中，越南游击队仅在河内与海防之间，即作战六百七十二次，毙伤法侵略军一千五百人。越盟总书记黄国越上月底在庆祝中华人民共和国成立的群众大会上，号召越南人民“向中国人民看齐，积极准备总反攻”。
    在印尼，印尼人民正开展游击战争，来反对哈达集团在海牙圆桌会议上签订的将印尼出卖给美荷帝国主义的卖国协定。最近，人民游击队在爪哇及西里伯斯等地的活动已经加强。
    　　　　中国各阶层人民热烈拥护驱逐国民党残匪出联合国
    本月十五日，我国外交部周部长曾致电联合国秘书长赖伊和本届联合国大会主席罗慕洛，声明中华人民共和国中央人民政府否认联合国大会中所谓“中国国民政府”派遣的蒋廷黻代表团的合法地位，要求立即取消这个“代表团”继续代表中国人民参加联合国的一切权利。这一庄严声明完全符合中国人民的愿望，博得了中国各阶层人民的热烈支持和拥护。国民党反动政府窍取了中国人民胜利的果实，因而窍取了中国人民在联合国的地位和权利，在国际舞台上充当帝国主义的应声虫，招摇撞骗，为非作歹，早已为中国人民和世界进步人民所不齿。现在，中华人民共和国中央人民政府已经成立，且已得到世界进步人民和全中国人民的热烈拥护。而国民党反动政府则已宣告灭亡，其残余势力不久即将被消灭，显然已完全丧失了代表中国人民的任何事实的和法律的根据。因此，凡是赞成联合国宪章和拥护联合国尊严的人，应该赞同我国政府的要求，把国民党残匪的代表赶出联合国！
    　　　　美帝公然反对苏联和平建议战贩真面目又一次原形毕露
    联合国大会第四届会议自九月二十日开幕以来，至今已两月，仍在继续进行中。到目前为止，已经小组委员会讨论的，有所谓“保、匈、罗侵犯人权与基本自由问题”、“希腊问题”、“批准新会员国问题”、“国际原子能管制问题”等。在美英集团操纵多数的情况下，经过小组委员会讨论通过的，有“朝鲜问题”、“前意大利殖民地问题”、“批准新会员国问题”等反动议案，经大会讨论通过的，有铁托集团担任安理会非常任理事反动议案。在这些议案的讨论或讨论通过时，苏联和人民民主国家的代表，坚决维护联合国宪章，保护弱小民族权利和保卫世界和平，给了帝国主义侵略者以迎头痛击，彻底暴露了美英集团破坏联合国、凶横地干涉保、罗、匈、朝鲜等国的内政、无耻的瓜分意前殖民地并从事侵略战争的狰狞面目。从十四日起，联合国政治委员会已开始讨论苏联代表团所提的“关于谴责新战争准备、禁用原子武器及缔结五强加强和平公约”的议案。苏联代表团团长维辛斯基发表了长篇演说，提议谴责在某些国家尤其美英两国所进行的新战争准备，呼吁禁止原子武器和建立严格的国际管制，要求安理会五常任理事国缔结加强和平公约，以保证世界的持久和平。但美国代表却公然出而反对苏联的和平建议，美帝国主义战争贩子的真面目在这里又一次地原形毕露。
    　　　　美帝扶植德日军国主义复活中国人民坚决反对这一阴谋
    以美帝国主义为首的国际反动派，除了在联合国从事各种侵略活动外，最近还加紧进行恢复德、日军国主义的阴谋，企图把德、日两国完全变为它们向外扩张和侵略的中心基地，以挽救它们已经遭受重大失败的帝国主义政策和日益严重的经济危机。西方帝国主义集团在开过一连串会议（如美驻欧外交官会议、“欧洲经济合作局”理事会及“欧洲委员会”部长会议等）以后，又于本月九日至十日在巴黎举行美英法三外长会议。在这一会议上，英法两国已进一步向美国主人屈服，同意西德傀儡加入美国领导下的“欧洲委员会”，为西德参加北大西洋联盟铺平道路；停止对西德和鲁尔区的拆卸，由美国控制德国的战争工业，并允许西德派遣驻外领事等。美帝国主义就想这样地把西德傀儡很快扶植起来，以便把它变成“政治经济整体化”后的西欧的中心，用来侵略欧洲和准备新战争冒险。
    与此同时，美帝国主义又在玩弄其单独对日缔结和约的把戏。据美国副国务卿韦伯九日承认：由美英集团与日本单独签订的和约，“正由美国务院及其他有关部门草拟中”。美国草拟的这一“对日和约”，其目的在于“把美国在远东的利益，集中于作为主要战略堡垒的日本”（合众社）。这就是说，美国企图利用这个“和约”，把日本变成美国在远东的军事侵略基地。为此，据美联社透露，美国计划在与日本单独缔结和约时，“同时缔结一个军事条约，规定占领结束后保留在日本的基地”。美帝国主义这一办法，将使日本军国主义在美国扶植下复活，是远东和平与世界和平的威胁。在抗日战争中牺牲最大、损失最重的中国人民，坚决反对帝国主义的这一可耻图谋。对日和约必须由中苏英美四国外长会议准备，没有中国人民的代表——中华人民共和国中央人民政府代表参加签订的任何对日和约，将一概无效。【新华社北京二十二日电】
