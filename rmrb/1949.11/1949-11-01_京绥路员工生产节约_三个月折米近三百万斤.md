Jing-Sui Railway Employees' Production and Savings
　　Nearly Three Million Jin of Rice Saved in Three Months

[Report from this newspaper] The production and savings campaign carried out by employees of the Jing-Sui Railway from July to September has achieved great results. According to statistics, the workers' savings and labor contributions in the three months have reduced the road bureau's costs by the equivalent of at least 2.89 million jin of rice, which is roughly equivalent to the total monthly salary of over 10,000 employees. Now, the efficiency of various tasks has been improved compared to the past. In terms of transportation, for example, transporting 10,000 tons required more than 1,600 freight cars in June, 900+ in July, and only 670+ in September. In July, each freight car averaged 3.06 days per turnaround, while in September it reached 1.62 days, and the transportation routes were greatly extended compared to the past. Due to the reasonable organization of labor, loading and unloading times have also been reduced compared to the past. In the three months, the Jing-Sui Railway ran 18 fewer trains while completing the transportation tasks. The Zhang, Kang, and Nan locomotive depots averaged 179.2 kilometers per locomotive per day in June, and increased to 216.8 kilometers in September, exceeding the bureau's standard. In addition, in the repair of vehicles in the machine factories, machine and inspection sections, the Zhangjiakou machine factory completed the overhaul of locomotives with 1386 work units, using 114 fewer work units than general repairs. At the same time, the workers also used their spare time to complete the manufacture and repair of 32,572 pieces of machinery and accessories, and the casting of 13.612 tons of copper, iron and hardware. In track maintenance work, every seven people changed the track by 335 meters per day, an increase of 70 meters compared to the past. Due to the increased awareness of the staff and workers, in addition to collecting steel rails sufficient to repair 14 kilometers of railway and a large number of bricks, tiles, and lime, the workers also voluntarily donated 25 kinds of electrical equipment. In order to save expenses, the stokers and drivers used their own wisdom and technology to save a total of 2,891 tons of machine coal in three months, and about 3,050 liters of cylinder oil, etc. In addition, all employees saved 2,784 degrees of electricity and used waste products to reduce the expenditure on office supplies and sundries by 13,465 jin of millet. In addition, more than 10,000 employees and family members at various stations completed a total of 57 kilometers of ballast screening work in their spare time. In three months, the workers contributed a total of 21,623 work units, saving a lot of state property.

　　京绥路员工生产节约
  　三个月折米近三百万斤
    【本报讯】京绥路员工在七月至九月开展的生产节约运动，已获得巨大成绩。据统计三个月中工人的节约、献工，已使该路局减低成本最低折米二百八十九万斤，即大体上等于万余员工一个月的薪金总数。现在，各种工作效率都已较前提高。在运输方面，如运输一万吨，六月份需用车皮一千六百余辆，七月份为九百余辆，九月份则仅用六百七十余辆。七月份每辆货车平均三·○六日周转一次，九月份则达到了一·六二日，而运输路线却比过去大为延长。由于合理的组织了劳动力，装卸时间也较前减少。三个月中，京绥路少开了十八列车而完成了运输任务。张、康、南三机务段每台机车六月份平均每日走一七九·二公里，九月份则提高到二一六·八公里，超过了局定标准。另外在机厂、机、检段修车上，张家口机厂以一三八六个工完成了大修机车，比一般修车少用一一四工。与此同时，工友们并利用空余时间完成了制造、修理机具配件三二五七二件和铸造铜铁五金一三·六一二吨。在养路工作中，每七人每日改道达三三五公尺，比过去增多七○公尺。由于职工觉悟的提高，工友们除搜集了能修十四公里铁路的钢轨和大批砖瓦、石灰外，并自动捐献了二十五种电务器材。为了节省开支，司炉、司机同志们用自己的智慧和技术，三个月共节省了机煤二千八百九十一吨。汽缸油等约三○五○立。除此全体员工并节电二七八四度，和利用废品使办公用具杂品少开支了一三四六五斤小米。加上各站员工及家属万余人在业余献工完成总长五十七公里的筛碴工作，三个月工友们共献工二一六二三个工，节省了不少国家财产。
