　　Shanxi Xing County and Other Four Special Districts
  　Add 20,000 Head of Livestock in Half a Year
    [Our Dispatch] With the active leadership and assistance of the Communist Party and the People's Government, farmers in various parts of Shanxi have greatly increased the breeding and purchase of livestock, providing favorable conditions for the restoration and development of agricultural production. According to incomplete statistics from thirty-seven counties in the four special districts of Xing County, Yuci, Changzhi, and Yicheng, Shanxi Province, by the autumn, more than 19,600 head of cattle, mules, donkeys, and horses had been added in the past six months. Yicheng Special District alone added more than 10,000 head of livestock, accounting for one-ninth of the original total, reaching 70 percent of the pre-war level (mostly through breeding). Statistics from nine counties in Changzhi and Yuci Special Districts show that nearly 2,000 foals were bred in less than half a year. The increase in livestock has played a significant role in this year's production. For example, Changzi County purchased 1,286 head of livestock, which solved the cultivation difficulties on 40,000 mu of land. The achievement of these results is mainly due to the implementation of policies by Party and government leading organs at all levels to reward and support livestock breeding. In addition, local banks have provided large amounts of livestock loans and food loans through cooperatives or directly, organized livestock dealers to transport livestock from livestock-producing areas, and promoted the sale of local products in exchange for livestock to give to farmers. In promoting livestock breeding, Changzhi and Yicheng Special Districts, in addition to conducting in-depth propaganda on "exemption from military service for breeding stock" and rewarding the purchase of breeding stock in large quantities, paid special attention to raising the status of those who raise breeding stock. They convened meetings of breeding stock households to exchange experiences, summarize achievements, and select models, which greatly encouraged livestock breeding. In Yicheng Special District, the government provides certain subsidies to "experts" and "skilled workers" who raise breeding stock every year. At present, governments in various regions are planning to vigorously support farmers in increasing livestock in the future, and pay special attention to protection. After investigation, Jinxi North, a livestock-producing area, has decided to make full use of mountain conditions to vigorously breed livestock, striving to restore to the pre-war level within two or three years for export. In order to quickly make up for the shortage of 22,000 head of livestock, Yicheng Special District has formulated a plan to promote breeding this winter and measures to protect livestock: (1) strictly prohibit the slaughter of draught animals; (2) identify, generally train, and cultivate veterinarians; (3) carry out livestock epidemic prevention and hygiene work; (4) promote special feeding of livestock and summarize farmers' feeding experience.

　　山西兴县等四专区
  　半年增添牲口两万头
    【本报讯】山西各地农民，在共产党和人民政府的积极领导与扶助下，大量繁殖与购置牲口，给恢复和发展农业生产准备了有利条件。据兴县、榆次、长治、翼城四个专区的三十七个县不完全材料统计，至秋前为止，半年来已增加牛骡驴马一万九千六百余头，仅翼城专区就增添牲口万余头，占原有总数的九分之一，达到了战前水平的百分之七十（大部是繁殖的）；长治、榆次专区九个县统计，不到半年繁殖成驹者近二千头。由于牲畜的增加对今年生产起了很大作用。如长子增购牲口一千二百八十六头，使四万亩土地的耕作困难得到解决。这些成绩的获得，主要是由于各级党政领导机关贯彻执行了奖励与扶植繁殖牲口的政策，此外各地银行通过合作社或直接大批发放牲畜贷款贷粮，组织畜贩，到产畜地区贩运，同时推销土产，购回牲畜，换给农民。在推动繁殖牲畜中，长治、翼城两专区，除深入宣传“种畜免服军勤”，奖励大批购买种畜外，特别注意了提高抚养种畜者的地位；召开种畜户会议，交流经验，总结成绩，评选模范，大大鼓励了牲畜的繁殖。翼城专区对于养种畜的“行家”“能手”，政府每年均给予一定津贴。目前各地政府均计划今后大力扶助农民增加牲畜，并特别注意保护。产畜区晋西北经过调查，确定利用山地条件，大力繁殖，争取两三年内恢复到战前水平向外出口；翼城专区为迅速补足二万二千头牲口的缺额，订出了今冬推广繁殖的计划，并订出保护牲畜的措施：（一）严禁宰杀耕畜；（二）鉴定、普训、培养兽医；（三）开展牲畜防疫卫生工作；（四）提倡专喂牲口，总结农民饲养经验。
