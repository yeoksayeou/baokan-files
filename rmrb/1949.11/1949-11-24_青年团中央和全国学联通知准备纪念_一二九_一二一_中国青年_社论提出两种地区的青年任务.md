Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 23rd: The Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League and the All-China Student Federation jointly issued a notice today regarding the commemoration of "December 9th" and "December 1st." The full text is as follows:

　　The fourteenth anniversary of the "December 9th" Movement and the fourth anniversary of the "December 1st" Movement are approaching. Commemorating these two dates today, when the People's Republic of China has been founded and the entire country is about to be completely liberated, is of great significance. The "December 9th" and "December 1st" of the past were days when Chinese students waged heroic struggles against imperialism and the Kuomintang's traitorous and reactionary government. But now, students in the vast liberated areas have begun to receive New Democratic education in their own country. Therefore, the main task of students in the future is to engage in New Democratic study under the leadership of the People's Government, so as to well undertake the arduous responsibility of building a new China, and to support the struggle of youth and students of various oppressed nations in the East and democratic youth throughout the world.

　　Students and Youth League members in schools in all regions should strengthen New Democratic study, unite teachers and students, and actively and systematically transform the old education system and curriculum under the leadership of the People's Government's education authorities, as the best commemoration of these two festivals. Youth League committees and student federations in all regions should adopt different methods to hold commemorations without hindering study, such as holding commemoration meetings, evening parties, exhibitions, publishing publications, wall newspapers, and listening to reports on the historical facts of the "December 9th" and "December 1st" movements in schools as units.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 23rd: The 27th issue of "China Youth" published an editorial entitled "Strengthening New Democratic Study is the Best Commemoration of 'December 9th' and 'December 1st,'" stating:

　　How should we commemorate "December 9th" and "December 1st" this year?

　　First, we must inherit the glorious revolutionary tradition of "December 9th" and "December 1st." The youth in the "December 9th" and "December 1st" movements, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, closely combined with the workers and peasants, and bravely opposed imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionary traitorous government. Undoubtedly, the youth of today should inherit this revolutionary spirit and carry the revolutionary war to the end.

　　Second, and this must be given special attention, the main tasks of today's youth have undergone fundamental changes compared to the "December 9th" and "December 1st" movements of that year. The task of the youth of that time was to overthrow the old China. Now, except for a small piece of land temporarily occupied by Chiang Kai-shek's remnant bandits, which will soon be liberated and still needs to carry out this task, the main task of youth in the vast areas has become actively participating in the construction of a new China. The reason why the two tasks are different is that the youth are now in two different worlds, that is, two different countries and societies. It is the natural duty of the youth to actively participate in the construction of the motherland in their own country. How should students and Youth League members in schools undertake the task of construction? That is to strengthen New Democratic study, unite teachers and students under the leadership of the People's Government's education authorities, and actively carry out the restoration, development, and reform of education in a step-by-step manner. This is the best commemoration of the "December 9th" and "December 1st" movements for the youth.

　　青年团中央和全国学联通知准备纪念“一二九”“一二一”   
    “中国青年”社论提出两种地区的青年任务
    【新华社北京二十三日电】中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会、中华全国学生联合会今日联合发出关于纪念“一二·九”“一二·一”的通知，全文如下：
    “一二·九”运动十四周年与“一二·一”运动四周年纪念日即将来到。在中华人民共和国已经成立，全国即将完全解放的今天来纪念这两个日子，有很重大的意义。过去的“一二·九”和“一二·一”，是中国学生向帝国主义和国民党卖国反动政府进行英勇斗争的日子。但在现在，广大已解放地区的学生，已经在人民自己的国家里，开始受着新民主主义教育，因此，今后的学生，主要的任务是在人民政府领导之下，展开新民主主义的学习，以便很好地担负起艰巨的建设新中国的责任，并支援东方各个被压迫民族青年学生和全世界民主青年的斗争。
    各地学生和学校青年团应以加强新民主主义学习、团结师生，在人民政府教育机关领导下，积极地有步骤地改造旧学制和课程，作为对这两个节日的最好的纪念。各地青年团团委和各地学联，在不妨碍学习条件下，采用不同的方式举行纪念，如学校为单位召开纪念大会、晚会、展览会、出版刊物、壁报、听取“一二·九”“一二·一”运动史迹的报告等。
    【新华社北京二十三日电】“中国青年”第二十七期以“加强新民主主义学习是对‘一二·九’‘一二·一’最好的纪念”为题发表社论称：
    今年我们怎样来纪念“一二·九”和“一二·一”呢？
    第一、要继承“一二·九”“一二·一”的光荣的革命传统。“一二·九”“一二·一”运动中的青年们，在中国共产党领导之下，与工农群众密切结合，英勇地反对帝国主义，反对国民党反动卖国政府。无疑地，现在的青年，应该继承这种革命精神把革命战争进行到底。
    第二、这是必须特别注意的，现在的青年们的主要任务，和当年的“一二·九”“一二·一”运动的，发生了根本的变化。当年的青年们的任务是推翻旧中国，在现在，除掉还有一小块暂时还被蒋介石残匪盘踞但很快地即将解放的地方，依然需要执行这个任务以外，广大地区的青年的主要任务，已经变为积极参加新中国的建设。两种任务所以不同，便是因为青年们已经处在两个不同的天地，就是说两个不同的国家和社会。青年们在人民自己的国家里，积极参加祖国的建设，是自己的天职。学校里的学生和青年团员，怎样来担负起建设的任务呢？那就是加强新民主主义学习，在人民政府教育机关领导下，团结师生，积极地进行有步骤地教育的恢复发展和改革工作。这就是青年们对于“一二·九”运动“一二·一”运动最好的纪念。
