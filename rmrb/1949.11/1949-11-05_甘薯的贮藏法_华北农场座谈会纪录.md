Sweet Potato Storage Methods
　　Record of a North China Farm Symposium

　　The sweet potato, also known as sweet potato, white potato, yam, etc., is a crop that suffers few disasters, is easy to manage, and produces abundant yields. In areas with consecutive years of poor harvests, widespread planting to overcome famine is ideal. In addition to its tubers (sweet potatoes) being used as food, its vines can also feed livestock. In normal years, the harvest of sweet potatoes per mu is equivalent to the harvest value of one and a half to two mu of ordinary crops.

　　Although sweet potatoes have many advantages, they have one major disadvantage: they are not easy to store. This is the biggest headache that farmers cannot solve. During the storage period, a slight oversight can lead to the risk of piles rotting. In fact, this disadvantage can be mitigated with attention to various aspects. To this end, the North China Farm recently held a symposium, contributing knowledge and experience on sweet potato storage. The important matters to be noted in sweet potato storage discussed at the symposium are summarized as follows:

　　I. Matters needing attention regarding harvesting

　　1. The sweet potatoes should be harvested when they are fully mature, because immature sweet potatoes contain too much moisture and are prone to rot. About the symbol of sweet potato maturity; cut the sweet potato with a knife, and it will dry and turn white within a few minutes, otherwise it is not mature. Sweet potatoes are native to the tropics, and their tubers have very little resistance to cold. They will feel threatened at 9 degrees Celsius. It is generally more appropriate to harvest before frost.

　　2. Weather: Sweet potatoes should be harvested on sunny days with plenty of sunshine and high temperatures, which is beneficial for storage. It is best not to harvest on cloudy, rainy, or cold days.

　　3. When harvesting, use a "拐子" (a tool with a small crook) to dig out the sweet potatoes (with a section of the vine), because with the "拐子", it is easy to pay attention during harvesting, and the sweet potatoes are less damaged, and there are no breaks at the connection between each tuber and the stem, making it less prone to disease. It is best not to leave them overnight in the open after harvesting.

　　4. Avoid damage: Be careful when digging and transporting sweet potatoes. If they are scratched or broken, they are prone to disease and difficult to store.

　　5. If diseased potatoes are found during harvesting, they should be stacked and transported separately and should not be stored together to avoid contagion.

　　II. Storage methods and various precautions

　　1. Shape of storage cellar: Generally, there are three types of sweet potato storage cellars: round well-shaped, square shed-shaped, and cone-shaped (tower-shaped): (A) Round well-shaped cellar: Dig a straight tube downward in the ground, like a well, and then dig two or three storage rooms outward at the bottom, with a depth of 15 to 20 feet being the most suitable. (B) Square shed-shaped cellar: This type of cellar is shallower, about six feet deep, square, with the top covered with sorghum stalks or straw to form a flat-roofed house shape, and a small hole is left on the top for ventilation. (C) Cone-shaped cellar: like a tower, with a small top and a large bottom, and the depth is similar to that of a round well-shaped cellar. Regardless of which of the above three types of cellars is used, it is most suitable to be in a sunny and windproof place, and the cellar entrance should be left on the south side, and it is not good to be in a shady place.

　　2. Temperature and humidity of storage cellar: The temperature of the sweet potato storage cellar can be from 9 degrees Celsius to 20 degrees Celsius. For 10 to 20 days after the sweet potatoes are put into the cellar, the cellar temperature is best maintained at 25 degrees Celsius to 30 degrees Celsius. In this way, some sweet potatoes, even if they already have wounds, can heal themselves. The most suitable temperature afterwards is from 13 degrees Celsius to 15 degrees Celsius. Generally, the temperature inside the cellar should not be affected by the air temperature on the ground (must be in the constant temperature layer). In this way, although the good weather and snowy weather or the difference between day and night outside may have changes of more than 10 degrees, the difference inside the cellar is at most two or three degrees.

　　The humidity inside the cellar should be around 80%. If you press your fingerprints on the walls of the cellar with your hand, and the fingerprints can be displayed, it is the appropriate humidity.

　　3. Points to note when sweet potatoes are put into the cellar and during storage:

　　(A) Selection of sweet potatoes: First, select the sweet potatoes once. Any that are diseased or have rotted should be immediately removed and not mixed into storage to avoid contagion. Spring potatoes are not resistant to long-term storage. If you want to store them for a long time, you should use wheat stubble potatoes (summer potatoes). Moreover, varieties with more starch content are better.

　　(B) Remove leaves and impurities: For sweet potatoes with "拐子", the leaves on the vines should be removed, and the messy stems and leaves mixed in the sweet potato pile should be removed before they are put into the cellar. This can also reduce the occurrence of diseases and rot.

　　(C) Add sandy soil: Before putting sweet potatoes into the cellar, first spread a layer of sandy soil on the bottom of the cellar, and then add a layer of sandy soil for each layer of sweet potatoes, filling the gaps between the sweet potatoes with sand. This can isolate each sweet potato with sandy soil, avoiding the spread of disease, and at the same time maintaining the temperature inside the cellar and absorbing part of the moisture evaporated by the sweet potatoes.

　　(D) Arrangement of sweet potatoes: When sweet potatoes are put into the cellar, they should be arranged in rows and neatly stored. Whether it is a round well or a square shed-shaped cellar, they should be arranged neatly in circles. The first circle (the outermost circle) should have the "拐子" end facing outwards (so that the "拐子" is connected to the cellar wall), the second circle should have the "拐子" end facing inwards (the first circle of potato blocks is connected to the second circle of potato blocks), the third circle "拐子" again faces outwards ("拐子" is connected to "拐子"), and the fourth circle "拐子" faces inwards again, and so on until it is full. In other words, it is necessary to avoid blocks leaning against the cellar wall and avoid "拐子" relying on blocks.

　　(E) Storage quantity: The amount of sweet potatoes stored in each cellar should not exceed two-thirds of the total cellar volume. The stacking height should not exceed five feet and five inches. One-third of the space must be left above the sweet potato pile to allow for temperature, humidity, and air exchange. Otherwise, it is easy to rot.

　　(F) If it is a square shed-shaped cellar, a sorghum stalk or straw bundle can be erected in the center of the sweet potato pile in the cellar, extending directly to the outside of the cellar roof. This way, it is possible to check the top of the grass bundle on the cellar roof for any rotting or odor. If there is an odor, it means that there are rotten sweet potatoes inside, and you should immediately check inside to avoid infecting other sweet potatoes.

　　(G) The first month after the sweet potatoes are put into the cellar is the most vulnerable period. Because after the sweet potatoes are piled up in the cellar, "stacking heat" occurs, which makes the temperature inside the cellar too high, and the sweet potatoes are prone to rot. Therefore, special attention should be paid to air circulation and inspection during this period. Therefore, some people pile the sweet potatoes outside for a few days before putting them into the cellar.

　　(H) Time to open the cellar: After the sweet potatoes are put into the cellar, try to avoid opening the cellar. If you need to eat them, it is best to take out more to avoid opening the cellar too many times, because each time the cellar is opened, cold air can invade once, causing the cellar temperature to drop sharply, and the sweet potatoes are prone to rot. If it is necessary to open the cellar, it is safer to open the cellar at noon on extremely warm days. During the storage period, pay attention to observing whether there is water condensation in the cellar. If it is found that the potato skin is slightly damp, the ventilation holes should be opened to remove excessively humid air. The opening of ventilation holes or cellar doors must be done on sunny days and when the outside temperature is not lower than the cellar temperature, and a part can be opened around 2 pm, and the rest of the time must be kept closed.

　　(I) If an old cellar is used for storage, the four walls and the bottom of the cellar should be scraped off a layer of old soil (about one inch thick), or the cellar should be burned once with fire to scrape off or kill the germs left in the cellar last year, which is also a way to avoid the occurrence of diseases during the storage period.

　　甘薯的贮藏法
  　华北农场座谈会纪录
    甘薯俗称甜薯、白薯、地瓜或山药等，是一种灾害较少，容易管理，而产量丰富的作物。在连年歉收的地区，广泛的种植，用以渡荒，是再好也没有的了。除了它的块根（白薯）可以供食粮外，它的秧子还可喂牲畜。在平年每亩甘薯的收获，相当于普通庄稼一亩半到两亩的收获价值。
    甘薯虽然有很多的优点，但是它有一个最大的缺点，就是不容易贮藏。这是老乡们最感头痛而无法解决的，在贮藏期中，稍不注意，即有成堆腐烂的危险。其实它这个缺点，只要多方面的注意，是可减轻其危险性的。为此，华北农场日前曾召开了一个座谈会，贡献了有关于甘薯贮藏的知识和经验，今将在座谈会上所讨论甘薯贮藏中应注意各重要事项，总结如下：
  　一　关于收获方面应注意事项
    １、甘薯收获时期应俟其充分成熟，因为未成熟的甘薯含水分过多，容易腐烂。关于甘薯成熟之象征；将甘薯用刀切开，于数分钟内即干燥而成白色，否则即未成熟。甘薯原产热带，它的块根抗寒力非常弱，在摄氏九度时就会感受威胁，普通在降霜以前收获较为合适。
    ２、天气：应在日光充足，气温较高的晴天下收获甘薯，这对于贮藏是有益的，最好不在阴雨或严寒的日子收获。
    ３、收获时要带拐子刨出（带一截蔓子），因带有拐子，在收获时容易引起注意，甘薯破伤少，且各个块根与茎部接连处亦无破痕，不易传染病害。收获后最好不在露地过夜。
    ４、勿使破伤：在刨甘薯时及搬运时都须要小心，如果刨伤或碰破，都易于传染病害，不易贮藏。
    ５、在收获时如发现病薯，即行分别堆放及搬运，不可混合贮藏，以免传染。
  　二　关于贮藏法及各种注意事项
    １、贮藏窖的形状：普通甘薯贮藏窖有圆井状、方棚状及圆锥状（塔状）三种：（甲）圆井状窖：在地面向下挖一直筒，如井状，然后在底部再向外分挖二、三贮藏室，深度以一丈五——二丈最合适。（乙）方棚状窖：这种窖较浅，约六尺深，方形，上顶用秫秸或谷草盖成平顶屋状，并在顶上留一小孔，以通空气。（丙）圆锥状窖：如塔形，上口小，下底大，深度与圆井状窖差不多。上面这三种窖，不论用那一种，总要在向阳光并能防风的地方最相宜，窖口应留在南面，在背阴处不好。
    ２、贮藏窖的温度及湿度：甘薯贮藏窖的温度由摄氏九度到二十度均可。甘薯入窖后十日至二十日，窖温最好能维持摄氏二十五度到三十度。这样有些甘薯虽已有的伤口亦可以自己愈合起来，以后最适宜的温度是由摄氏十三度到十五度。普通窖内的温度，以能不受地面上气温之影响（须在恒温层）为宜，如此外面的好天气与风雪天气或白天与夜间的差别，虽有十度以上的变化，但窖内最多不过差两三度。
    窖内之湿度要在百分之八十左右，如用手在窖内墙壁上捺印，可将指纹显出，即为适宜之湿度。
    ３、甘薯下窖时及在贮藏期中应注意的各点：
    （甲）甘薯之选择：先将甘薯挑选一遍，凡有病害及已腐烂的应立即剔出，勿混入贮藏，以免传染。春薯不耐长久贮存，如想长久贮存，应当是用麦茬薯（夏薯）。而且以含淀粉质较多的品种为好。
    （乙）除去叶子及杂质：带有拐子的甘薯，应把蔓子上的叶子去掉，并把混在甘薯堆内的杂乱茎叶检出，然后下窖。如此也可减少病害及腐烂的发生。
    （丙）加砂土：在甘薯下窖以前，先用砂土把窖底铺一层，然后每放一层甘薯，即加一层砂土，将甘薯间之空隙，均用砂填满，这样可以将各甘薯用砂土隔离，能避免病害之传染，同时可保持窖内温度，并可吸收一部分甘薯蒸发的水分。
    （丁）甘薯排列：在甘薯下窖时要排成行列，整齐存放，无论圆井或方棚状窖，都要一圈一圈的排列整齐。第一圈（最外面的一圈）要把拐子一头向外放（让拐子和窖壁相接），第二圈要拐子头向里（第一圈薯块与第二圈的薯块相接），第三圈拐子又向外（拐子与拐子相接），第四圈拐子再向里，如是一直到放满为止。换句话说，就是要避免块靠着窖壁，避免拐子与块相依靠。
    （戊）存放数量，每窖存放之甘薯，以不超过全窑容积三分之二为合适，推集高度，以不超过五尺五寸为宜。在甘薯堆上面须留有三分之一的空隙，以便温度湿度及空气的交换。否则即易腐烂。
    （已）如系方棚状窖，可在窖内甘薯堆之中心立一高梁杆或谷草束，直通至窖顶外面。这样可以在窖顶上草束的顶端，时常检查有无腐烂臭味发生。如有臭味，即是内部有腐烂甘薯发生，应立即到里边检查，免的把其他多数的甘薯传染。
    （庚）甘薯下窖后一个月以内，为最易腐烂时期。因甘薯堆积窖内后，即发生“堆积热”，使窖内温度过高，甘薯容易腐烂，所以在这一时期内应特别注意空气流通及检查工作。因此也有于入窖以前先把甘薯在外面堆积数日再行下窖者。
    （辛）开窖时间：甘薯下窖后应尽量避免开窖，如需要食用，最好多拿出一些，以免开窖次数过多，因每开一次窖，即能使冷气侵入一次，使窖温骤低，甘薯就易腐烂。如果必须开窖时，则应在极暖天气的中午开窖较为安全。在贮藏期中须留心观察窖内有无水气凝结现象，若发现薯皮微带潮湿，则宜开放通气孔，以排除过分潮湿之空气。通气孔或窖门的开放，必须在晴天及窖外温度不低于窖温时，可于午后两点左右开放一部，其余时间须经常关闭。
    （壬）如系利用旧窖贮藏时，应先把窖的四壁及窖底刮去一层旧土（约一寸厚），或在窖内用火烧一次，把去年遗留窖内的病菌刮去或烧死，也是避免在贮藏期中发生病害的一种办法。
