(Beijing News) The following is the full text of Mayor Nie Rongzhen's report to the Second Session of the Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference on the implementation of the resolutions of the First Session of the Conference up to the end of October, as well as future work guidelines and plans:

Fellow Representatives:

On behalf of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, I am reporting to you on the implementation of the resolutions of the First Session of the Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference up to the end of October, as well as future work guidelines and plans.

　　　　(I) Implementation of Resolutions

In addition to adopting the work reports of the Military Control Commission and the Municipal Government, and agreeing to continue the three important tasks mentioned in the reports, namely (1) further consolidating revolutionary order, (2) continuing to restore and develop production, and (3) continuing to develop the people's cultural and educational undertakings, the First Session of the Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference also adopted 171 resolutions to be handled or referenced by the Municipal Government. At that time, Deputy Mayor Zhang Youyu stated on behalf of the Municipal Government that these resolutions would be implemented as quickly as possible within the limits of available manpower and financial resources. As of the end of October, with the exception of seven proposals, such as "establishing public bathhouses," which could not be implemented for the time being, the remaining 164 proposals had been implemented with due consideration of urgency and priority. Some have been completed; some are still in progress; and some have been planned and are ready for implementation. Specific implementation details have been listed and distributed, with supplementary written reports from the relevant departments. Here, only a summary report is given, without going into details.

(1) In order to consolidate revolutionary order, we mobilized 3,480 staff members from the Public Security Bureau and the Disciplinary Corps in July and August to check household registrations, discovering 1,810 special agents, 3,320 reactionary party and league members, 7,809 scattered military personnel, and over 24,000 other elements that endanger social order. At the same time, we continued the registration work for reactionary party and league members, which began in late July. As of October 25, a total of 3,087 reactionary party and league members had been registered. In addition, 3,124 special agents were also registered. During this period, 276 cases involving special agents were cracked, and 209 remnants of Wang Fenggang's bandits were arrested. This further consolidated revolutionary order.

Social order has also improved daily. In October, no robbery cases occurred in the jurisdiction of eleven of the city's twenty public security sub-bureaus. The remaining nine sub-bureaus had a total of twenty-six robbery cases. This is the month with the fewest robbery cases since liberation. Among these robbery cases, nineteen were solved, accounting for 73 percent of the total.

In coordination with this, the Municipal People's Court also adopted a positive approach to handling cases involving counter-revolutionaries, profiteers who disrupt prices, and local bullies who oppress the people. During this period, a total of sixteen cases were judged, and three people were sentenced to death. On the other hand, a policy of labor reform was adopted, and more than 300 physically strong prisoners were selected to form labor brigades to participate in various labor activities. (⑴⑷)

(2) In order to restore and develop production, we first launched a campaign to reduce costs and improve quality in state-owned enterprises. Due to the implementation of streamlining and economizing, more planned production, and further democratic management, this campaign has achieved initial results. For example, at the Yanjing Paper Mill: in the past, up to 50 percent of the products did not meet standards, but this has been reduced to 20 percent; the cost per ream of paper in September was 778 yuan lower than in August, while sales increased from 1,828 reams per month to 7,707 reams. Another example is the New Construction Glass Factory: as a result of saving raw materials and labor, more than 5,000 catties of rice can be saved each month, and the production scale has increased from one furnace to two furnaces, and is now planned to increase to three furnaces. Secondly, private industries were given necessary support through methods such as ordering, processing, purchasing finished products, and providing production loans. For example, in the textile and dyeing industry, 70-80% of the work is processing for trading companies, or trading companies purchase their finished products. In addition, the People's Bank's loans to private industries amounted to more than 590 million yuan in August and September, and reached more than 960 million yuan in October alone. The previously sluggish special handicrafts industry has gradually recovered after receiving assistance from two loans, increasing by more than 500 households in September compared with July, with an increase of nearly three times the number of workers. In addition, in order to open up sales channels, we have strengthened the work of the Urban-Rural Trade Guidance Committee; organized industrial circles to visit the Northwest and other places; signed agreements on production and sales links with industrial and commercial circles in Zhangjiakou and other places; and opened up the inland market. For example, Zhuolu alone ordered about 100 threshing machines from our city. As industry has received support and has found outlets, floating capital has gradually been absorbed into industry, and commercial capital also has a tendency to shift to production. For example, Fuxing Flour Mill added five sets of machinery, Beijing Textile and Dyeing Factory added ten electric machines, and new factories include Huaguang Paint Factory and Xinhua Enterprise Company's acetic acid factory. In addition, the addition of a machine weaving department by Dahua Department Store and the planned establishment of a factory by Wangfu Department Store are particularly indicative of the shift of commercial capital to production. If this continues, production has prospects for further recovery and development.

In order to develop production, properly handling labor-capital relations based on the principle of mutual benefit for labor and capital is also one of the main keys. In August, September and October, in addition to approving four collective contracts for the traditional Chinese medicine industry, the night soil industry, the construction industry, and the mechanized flour milling industry, the Labor Bureau actively carried out mediation work in labor-capital disputes. This has led to a gradual reduction in labor-capital disputes, from 63 cases in August to 31 cases in October. This is beneficial to the development of production.

The facts of the past two and a half months have proven that as long as planned production, democratic management, and the handling of labor-capital relations in private enterprises under the principle of mutual benefit for labor and capital are implemented, product quality can be improved, costs can be reduced, and sales channels can be opened up, thereby enabling production to move towards recovery and development. Although we have achieved considerable results in this regard, it is not enough and we must continue to work hard.

In terms of agricultural production, thanks to our promotion and assistance, the planting of wheat in the suburbs this year has greatly increased. According to surveys, wheat was planted on 169,326 mu last year, but this year it is 332,162 mu, which is 196% of last year's figure, accounting for 33% of the total cultivated land area. In addition, the land reform in the suburbs has been making preparations since July, and has first selected more than a dozen experimental villages to complete the work of typical demonstration. It is expected that land reform will be completed before the spring plowing next year. This will greatly help agricultural production next year. Although this is not an important issue for Beijing's overall production and income, it is of great significance for agricultural production in the suburbs. According to our experience, production will be affected if land reform is not completed quickly. It has long been completed in the old liberated areas of North China, and is still ongoing in the newly liberated areas. All strata in the rural areas of Beijing's suburbs are waiting for changes in land relations. If it is not completed in time, preparations for agricultural production next spring will be too late. Therefore, land reform in the suburbs must be actively carried out.

While striving to restore and develop production, we have also worked to stabilize prices and ensure supplies for citizens. On the one hand, trading companies and cooperatives stabilize prices and effectively supply people's needs through their operations. For example, trading companies supplied approximately 66.4 million catties of coarse grains and more than 18.4 million catties of refined grains to the city in August, September, and October, as well as 252,152 bolts of various fabrics. Cooperatives have established 10 new production cooperatives and 60 consumer cooperatives since the closing of the First Session of the People's Representative Conference, increasing the number of members in production cooperatives by 1,050 and the number of members in consumer cooperatives by 117,592. In two and a half months, the general cooperative supplied more than 13 million catties of grain and 440 million yuan worth of daily necessities to various cooperatives. On the other hand, market management was strengthened, two exchanges for yarn and cloth and for grain were established, and speculation by unscrupulous merchants was strictly suppressed. As a result, the sharp rise in prices that began in July gradually stabilized. On October 8, the average price of 30 commodities rose by only 3.92% compared to August 5, while the price of grain fell by an average of 3.44%. Since October 7, due to rising prices in neighboring areas and speculation by unscrupulous merchants, prices in Beijing have also fluctuated. At the end of October, the average price of 30 commodities rose by about 60% compared to the end of September, and the upward trend has not stopped! Prices rose even more sharply in November. This is an extremely serious phenomenon, and it is necessary to take the necessary measures to overcome it. This issue will be reported separately later.

(3) In order to develop education and cultural undertakings, we have added classes and schools specifically for workers' children in primary and secondary schools, enrolling 10,609 new students. We have also widely established children's literacy classes to supplement the inadequacy of primary school education. 617 classes have been established, with 18,604 children participating. In addition, we have called on, promoted, and helped schools, institutions, organizations, factories, etc., to hold various forms of adult continuing education. According to statistics in late October, there were 96 adult continuing education schools, with 5,705 students. More than 100 classes were also established in the suburbs.

At the same time, in order to improve school education, on the one hand, we have planned and step-by-step banned and rectified some reactionary private middle schools that misled students, some were closed, some were merged, and some were reorganized; on the other hand, we have implemented necessary reforms in the system and curriculum of general middle schools, such as reducing class hours, canceling unnecessary courses, and adopting a system of full-time teachers. This has gradually put middle school education on the right track. In addition, in order to promote vocational education, five vocational classes have been attached to municipal middle schools, and private middle schools have also attached eight vocational classes.

(4) In terms of urban construction, we have completed the paving of the Guang'anmen Street, Chaoyangmen Street, and Xuanwumen Street three major arterial roads, plus the cement pavement from Sanlihe to Dongliushujing, covering an area of 49,828 square meters; repaired 10,668 square meters of asphalt pavement and 533 square meters of gravel road in the city; repaired 8,443 square meters of dirt road and cobblestone road; repaired nine bridges and culverts. Dug out 3,769 meters of covered drains in the city; repaired covered drains in Guang'anmen Street and other places, and built 542 meters of new concrete pipes. Dredged the Zhinv River, Tongzi River, etc., excavating 5,619 cubic meters of earth. Opened up Tiananmen Square and reopened Jianguomen; demolished and filled in 27,000 square meters of trenches and bunkers on the city walls. In addition, a larger-scale winter work-relief plan has been formulated and will begin in early November.

(5) In terms of public health, we set up epidemic prevention stations in various suburbs and quarantine classes at each city gate in September to implement quarantine injections to prevent the spread of cholera, which proved to be quite effective. At the end of October, in order to prevent plague, an epidemic prevention committee was established to carry out epidemic prevention work such as quarantine, injections, rat catching, flea extermination, and garbage removal. As of November 18, 1,008,326 people have been given preventive injections; 214,421 people have been quarantined for plague; 722,585 square feet have been sprayed with DDT; 199 rooms and 145 beds have been disinfected with carbolic acid. In addition, because farmers in the suburbs have difficulty in obtaining medical treatment, we have consulted with the General Cooperative to lend 40,000 catties of rice to pilot medical cooperative societies in the suburbs. Four societies have now been established in Qinglongqiao, Nanyuan, Deshengmen, and Mentougou. In addition, 11 health stations and 2 mobile medical teams have been established in the suburbs, all providing free treatment. For workers, in addition to planning to set up workers' clinics in various districts, free or reduced fees are implemented for impoverished workers in municipal hospitals. In addition, cleaning up accumulated manure in the city is also one of the main tasks related to public health. A total of 389 manure pits, 124 manure boxes, 16 manure yards, more than 2,000 buckets of manure liquid, and more than 15,000 catties of dry manure have been eliminated, and the work is still continuing. On the other hand, 11 public toilets have been newly built and five have been renovated; 11 urinals have been newly built; 53 sewage ponds have been renovated and 30 have been newly built.

(6) In terms of social relief, we have systematically called on and introduced unemployed workers and ordinary citizens to go to Chabei, Inner Mongolia, Fushun, or return to their original places to participate in production. We also provided subsidies for travel expenses and cotton-padded clothing and bedding to take care of their lives. As of the end of October, a total of 1,787 people had left Beijing. In addition, 250 people were agreed to be employed in Suiyuan, but they have not yet set off due to the interruption of epidemic prevention transportation. In addition, we have expanded the scope of accommodating beggars, accommodating 1,687 beggars, thieves, and scattered military personnel, forming two labor brigades, educating and reforming them, and sending them to Chahar and Inner Mongolia to reclaim wasteland and cut down trees. Among them, the sick, elderly, and those without labor power are properly安置 by the relief agencies.

We also responded to the call of the former North China People's Government and established the Beijing Municipal People's Relief Committee to promote relief work in the city. As of October 27, a total of more than 67 million yuan in cash, more than 53,000 catties of coarse grains, nine bags of white flour, and more than 5,400 pieces of clothing had been raised. The main relief targets were the disaster victims in Hebei Province and the suburbs of our city, as well as disaster victims who had fled to the urban area from various places.

As for the handling of the prostitute issue, we have completed the investigation. There are 230 licensed prostitute households in the city, with 1,421 people; a total of 1,462 "brothel owners," "madams," and staff members who directly rely on them for their livelihoods. There are 170 unlicensed prostitutes operating in secret, with more than 400 people. We would like to ask this session of the People's Representatives to make the final decision on how to deal with this.

Although we have implemented most of the resolutions of the First Session of the People's Representative Conference, the implementation has not been fast or thorough enough. This is certainly due to our insufficient efforts, but the main reason is limited manpower and financial resources. Our cadres are not yet familiar with urban work, and the monks are not good at grasping and implementing policies. Therefore, the efficiency of various tasks is very low, and deviations or errors often occur. On the other hand, Beijing's financial situation has always been in deficit. Although we have rectified it, it is still difficult to be self-sufficient for the time being. Construction funds rely on injections from North China, and North China's finances are not abundant, so construction work is not easy to complete on schedule according to plan.

The above situation of the implementation of the resolutions of the First Session of the People's Representative Conference is requested to be reviewed and examined by this session. The resolutions that have not yet been implemented or have not yet been completed will continue to be implemented.

　　　　(II) Future Work Guidelines and Plans

The main guidelines for future work are still the guidelines proposed by former Mayor Ye Jianying in his report to the First Session of the People's Representative Conference and the summary made by Comrade Peng Zhen on behalf of the Presidium, which were adopted by the conference. This is because the residual reactionary forces lurking in Beijing have not been completely eliminated, and it is necessary to further consolidate revolutionary order. Although some progress has been made in restoring and developing production and developing the people's cultural undertakings, it is only the first step in a long march. We must continue to move forward according to the established plan, especially the work of restoring and developing production, which requires great efforts. In addition, in view of the development of the national revolutionary situation and the importance of Beijing's position, we intend to propose a fourth guideline, namely the urban construction guideline. Comprehensive and long-term construction plans are being drafted by the relevant departments in consultation with experts, based on the demands of the people and soliciting opinions from all parties. The work to be carried out under the necessary and possible conditions at present is: first, to improve the supply of tap water so that citizens can use clean, cheap and sufficient water. The operation of the tap water business is related to the livelihood of the broad masses of the people. According to the Common Program, it should be publicly operated, not privately operated. The operation of the Beijing Tap Water Company is not only related to the livelihood of the two million people in the capital, and the future construction of the capital, but also has been publicly operated since the period of Japanese puppet rule, and the vast majority of its capital belongs to public property, and should never be handed over to private operation again. Now, someone is demanding the government to return it in the name of a director of the company. I think: even if we agree, two million people in Beijing will oppose it. Of course, private equity should be recognized and cleared, and appropriate measures should be taken to deal with it. Second, to rectify the sewers so that sewage can be discharged, first, to dig out and renovate the old ditches, and second, to plan and build the necessary new ditches; third, to improve environmental sanitation, thoroughly remove garbage and manure, and at the same time, adjust the distribution of hospitals, health clinics and clinics, and improve, enrich and add them as much as possible to facilitate citizens' medical treatment; fourth, to adopt methods such as work relief to mobilize a large amount of manpower to build roads and dredge rivers. The relevant departments have formulated plans for carrying out these tasks, and some have already begun to implement them.

In order to realize the above-mentioned urban construction guidelines, it is necessary to pay a considerable amount of funds. Therefore, it is necessary to sort out tax revenue, and the burden of Beijing citizens cannot be reduced for the time being. But we are taking the principle of "taking from the people" and "using it for the people" and will never waste a penny. In the municipal government's budget, the proportion of operating expenses is quite large. In the budget for the second half of this year, operating expenses have accounted for 40.18% of the total expenditure, not including the operating expenses used in the reserve fund. In the budget for the next year, which is being prepared, operating expenses are planned to increase to slightly more than 50% of the total expenditure.

According to Article 14 of Chapter III of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, "Before the convening of the local people's congresses by universal suffrage, the local people's representative conferences shall gradually exercise the functions and powers of the people's congresses," we have submitted a request to the Central People's Government for approval, and this session will elect a new Beijing Municipal People's Government by means of election. I believe that if our guidelines and plans are adopted by the conference, this new Beijing Municipal People's Government will implement them.

　　在北京市二届各界人民代表会议上
  　聂荣臻市长报告全文
    【北京讯】聂荣臻市长向北京市第二届各界人民代表会议的报告，全文如下：
    各位代表：
    我代表北京市人民政府向各位报告到十月底为止，执行第一届各界人民代表会议决议案的情况及今后工作方针和计划。
    　　　　（一）执行决议案的情况
    北京市第一届各界人民代表会议除通过军管会和市政府的施政报告，同意继续进行报告中所提到的三项重要工作，即（１）进一步巩固革命秩序，（２）继续恢复与发展生产，（３）继续发展人民的文化教育事业外，并通过交市政府办理或参考的决议案一百七十一件。当时张友渔副市长曾代表市政府，向大会表示：在人力财力许可的条件下，当尽量尽速地执行这些决议案。到十月底止，两个半月中，除“设立公营澡堂”等七案，一时还不能执行外，其余一百六十四案，都已斟酌缓急先后，分别执行。有的，已执行完毕；有的，还在继续进行；有的，已拟妥计划，准备实施。具体执行情况，除各主管部门另有书面的补充报告外，并已列表印发。这里，只是择要报告，不再详述。
    （一）为了巩固革命秩序，我们曾在七八月间，动员公安局和纠察总队三千四百八十余工作人员，进行查对户口，发现了一千八百一十个特务分子，三千三百二十个反动党团分子，七千八百零九个流散军人及二万四千余其他妨害社会治安分子。同时，继续进行七月下旬开始的反动党团分子登记工作。到十月二十五日止，共登记了反动党团分子三千零八十七名。另外，又登记了特务分子三千一百二十四名。在这期间，并破获特务案件二百七十六起，逮捕了王凤岗残匪二百零九人。这就进一步巩固了革命秩序。
    社会治安，亦日有进步，十月份，在全市二十个公安分局管辖区内，有十一个分局管辖区没有发生过抢劫案。其余九个分局管辖区发生过抢劫案共二十六起。这是解放以来发生抢劫案最少的一个月。在这些抢劫案中，破获了的有十九起，占总数的百分之七十三。
    与此相配合，市人民法院对反革命，扰乱物价的奸商和欺压人民的恶霸等案件，也采取了积极处理的方针。在这期间，共判决十六案，被处死刑的三人。另一方面采取了劳动改造的方针，挑选身体强壮的犯人三百余人，组成劳动大队，参加各种劳动。（⑴⑷）
    （二）为了恢复与发展生产，我们首先在公营企业中，发动了减低成本，提高质量的运动。由于实行了精简节约，比较有计划的生产及进一步民主管理，而使这个运动已获得初步成绩。例如燕京造纸厂：过去产品不合标准者达百分之五十，现已减到百分之二十；每令纸的成本，九月份较八月份，减低七百七十八元，而销售量则由每月一千八百二十八令增加到七千七百零七令。又如新建玻璃厂：节省原料人工的结果，每月可少开支米五千余斤，而生产规模，则由一盘炉增至二盘炉，现正拟增至三盘炉。其次，对私营工业，用订货、加工、收购成品以及生产贷款等方式，给予了必要的扶助。例如织染业，十之七八是给贸易公司加工，或由贸易公司收购其成品。又如人民银行给予私营工业的贷款，八九两月已贷出五亿九千余万元，而十月一个月即达九亿六千余万元。原已萧条的特种手工业，在得到两次贷款的扶助后，日渐恢复，九月份较七月份，增加了五百多户，工人增加了约近三倍。此外，为了打开销路，我们又加强了城乡贸易指导委员会的工作；组织工业界西北等地参观团；与张家口等地工商业界订立了产销联系的协定；开辟了内地的市场，例如涿鹿一地即向本市订购打稻机百台左右。由于工业得到扶助，且有了出路，于是游资逐渐被吸收到工业中来，而商业资本也有转向生产的趋势。例如福兴面粉厂增加五部机磨，北京织染厂增加十台电力机，而新建的工厂，则有华光油漆工厂和新华企业公司的醋酸工厂等。又如大华百货公司增设机织部，王府百货公司筹设工厂，尤为商业资本转向生产的表现。这样下去，生产是有其更进一步恢复和发展的前途的。
    为了发展生产，根据劳资两利的原则，适当处理劳资关系，亦为主要关键之一。劳动局在八九十三个月内，除批准国药业、粪业、建筑业、机制面粉业四个集体合同外，并积极进行了调解劳资纠纷的工作。这就使得劳资纠纷逐渐减少，从八月份的六十三件，减少到十月份的三十一件。对于发展生产是有裨益的。
    两个半月来的事实证明，只要实行生产计划化，管理民主化及在劳资两利的原则下，处理私营企业中的劳资关系，就可使生产品提高质量，减低成本，从而打开销路，也就可使生产走向恢复和发展。现在我们在这一方面虽已获得相当成绩，但还不够，仍须继续努力。
    在农业生产方面，由于我们的提倡与扶助，今年郊区种麦大大增加。据调查，去年种麦为十六万九千三百二十六亩，今年则为三十三万二千一百六十二亩，即为去年的百分之一九六，占耕地总面积的百分之三十三。又郊区土地改革，从七月起，即进行了一切准备，并先选择了十几个试验村，完成典型示范的工作。预期在明年春耕以前，完成土地改革。这样对明年农业生产将有很大帮助。虽然，这对北京的整个生产和收入来说，还不是重要问题，但对郊区农业生产来说，却有很大意义，根据我们的经验，土地改革如不很快完成，将会影响生产。在华北老解放区早已完成，新解放区尚在继续进行。北京郊区农村各阶层都正在等待土地关系改变。如果不及时完成，明春农业生产的准备工作，都将来不及。因此，郊区土地改革必须积极进行。
    与努力恢复和发展生产同时，我们也曾进行了稳定物价，保证市民供给的工作。一方面，由贸易公司和合作社通过经营，平抑物价，有效地供应人民需要，例如贸易公司八九十三个月曾供应全市粗粮约六千六百四十万斤，细粮一千八百四十余万斤，各种布匹二十五万二千一百五十二匹；合作社则自第一届各界人民代表会议闭幕以来，又新设了生产社十处，消费社六十处，共增加生产社员一千零五十人，和消费社员十一万七千五百九十二人，在两个半月中，总社共供给各合作社一千三百余万斤粮食及价值四亿四千余万元的日用品。另一方面，则加强市场管理，成立纱布和粮食两个交易所，并严格取缔奸商投机。结果，物价从七月间开始的猛涨，渐趋于平稳，到十月八日，三十种商品的平均价格，较八月五日，仅上涨百分之三点九二，而粮食类则平均下落了百分之三点四四。从十月七日起，由于邻区物价上涨，奸商投机操纵，京市物价也随之波动。十月底，三十种商品的平均价格，较九月底竟上涨了约百分之六十，而涨风迄未停止！到十一月更加暴涨。这是一个极严重的现象，必须采取克服它的必要措施。关于这个问题，后面当另行报告。
    （三）为了发展教育文化事业，我们曾在中小学，专为工人子弟增班增校，招收新生一万零六百零九人。又曾普遍设立儿童识字班，以补小学教育的不足。现已成立六百一十七班，参加的儿童一万八千六百零四名。此外，曾号召，推动和帮助各学校、机关、团体、工厂等，举办各种不同形式的成人补习教育。据十月下旬统计，已有成人补习学校九十六处，学生五千七百零五人，另在郊区成立一百余个班。
    同时，为了改进学校教育，我们一方面，有计划，有步骤，取缔和整顿了一些误人子弟的反动的私立中学，有的停办，有的合并，有的改组；他方面，对一般中学，实行了制度上和课程上的必要改革，如减少上课时数，取消不必要课程，采取教员专任制等。这就使得中学教育逐渐走上了正规。此外，为了提倡职业教育，已在市立中学附设五个职业班，私立中学附设的职业班也已有八班。
    （四）在都市建设方面，我们曾完成了广安门大街、朝阳门大街、宣武门大街三大干线的路面铺装，加上三里河至东柳树井的水泥路面，共面积四万九千八百二十八平方公尺；补修了全市沥青路面一万零六百六十八平方公尺和石碴路五百三十三平方公尺；修整土路和卵石路八千四百四十三平方公尺；修整桥梁涵洞九座。掏挖全市暗沟三千七百六十九公尺；修整广安门大街等处的暗沟，并新建混泥土管五百四十二公尺。疏浚织女河、筒子河等，挖土五千六百一十九公方。开辟天安门广场，重开建国门；拆除填平城墙上的战壕碉堡二万七千平方公尺。此外，并已拟定较大规模的冬季工赈计划，于十一月初开始进行。
    （五）在公共卫生方面，我们曾于九月间，在各郊区设防疫站，各城门设检疫班，实行检疫注射，预防霍乱流行，颇著成效。十月底，为预防鼠疫，特成立防疫委员会进行检疫、注射、捕鼠、灭蚤、清除垃圾等防疫工作。截至十一月十八日止，施行预防注射的，有一百万○八千三百二十六人；施行鼠疫检疫的，有二十一万四千四百二十一人；喷散Ｄ、Ｄ、Ｔ、七十二万二千五百八十五平方尺；石炭酸消毒房屋一百九十九间，床位一百四十五座。又因郊区农民医疗困难，曾商请合作总社贷米四万斤，在郊区试办医药合作社，现已成立青龙桥、南苑、德胜门、门头沟等四个社。另在郊区设立卫生站十一个，巡回医疗队两个，都是免费治疗。对工人，则除已在各区筹设工人诊疗所外，并在市立医院实行优待贫苦工人免费减费办法。此外，清除城内积粪，亦为有关公共卫生的主要工作之一。计共取消粪坑三百八十九个，粪箱一百二十四个，粪场十六处，粪稀二千余桶，粪干一万五千余斤，现仍在继续清除中。另一方面，增建公厕十一座，整修五座；增建尿池十一座；整修秽水池五十三座，新建三十座。
    （六）在社会救济方面，我们曾有计划地，号召与介绍失业的工人和一般市民分赴察北、内蒙、抚顺，或回原籍参加生产。并酌予补助路费和棉衣棉被，照顾了他们的生活。到十月底止，已离京的共计一千七百八十七人。另外商定到绥远就业的二五○人，现因防疫交通断绝，还没有启程。此外，并扩大收容乞丐的范围，收容了乞丐、小偷、流散军人等一六八七人，组成两个劳动大队，加以教育改造后，分别送往察哈尔、内蒙，开荒、伐木。其中，病老无劳动力的，另由救济机关适当安置。
    我们又曾响应前华北人民政府号召，成立北京市各界救灾委员会，推动全市救灾工作，截至十月二十七日止，共募集现款六千七百余万元，粗粮五万三千余斤，白面九袋，衣服五千四百余件，主要救济对象是河北省和本市郊区灾民及各地逃来城区的灾民。
    至于处理妓女问题，我们已完成了调查工作。本市挂牌营业的妓女共二三○户，一千四百二十一人；直接依靠他们为生的“妓院老板”、“领家”和伙计等共一千四百六十二人。实际设店营业但未挂牌的暗娼已查明者有一百七十家，四百余人。究应如何处理，拟请本届代表会议作最后决定。
    第一届各界人民代表会议的决议案，我们虽已大部执行，但执行得还不够迅速、彻底。这固然是由于我们的努力还不够积极，但主要原因还是为人力财力所限。我们的干部对城市工作还不熟习，和尚不善于掌握与执行政策。因此，各项工作的效率都很低，且常不免发生偏差或错误。另一方面，北京市的财政状况，向来入不敷出。虽经我们整顿，一时尚难自给，建设经费依靠华北挹注，而华北财政亦非充裕，故建设工作不易按计划如期完成。
    上述执行第一届各界人民代表会议决议案的情况，请本届会议审查检讨。其尚未执行或执行而尚未完成的决议案当继续执行。
    　　　　（二）今后的工作方针和计划
    今后的工作方针主要仍是前市长叶剑英同志在第一届各界人民代表会议上的报告和彭真同志代表主席团所作的总结，所提出而为会议采纳的方针。这是因为潜伏在北京市的、残余的反动势力还没有彻底肃清，革命秩序还有进一步巩固的必要，而恢复与发展生产及发展人民的文化事业的工作则虽有一些成绩、但还不过刚刚迈出了万里长征的第一步，仍须根据既定计划，继续前进，特别是恢复与发展生产的工作，尤须作极大的努力。此外，我们鉴于全国革命形势的发展及北京市所处地位的重要，拟提出第四项方针即市政建设方针。关于全面的、长期的建设计划，正在根据人民要求，广征各方意见，交由主管部门，商同专家，从事草拟。目前在必需和可能的条件下，所要进行的工作是：第一、改进自来水的供给状况，使市民能够用到清洁、廉价而充分的水。自来水事业的经营，关系广大人民的生计，根据共同纲领，原应公营，不应私营。北京自来水公司的经营，则不仅关系首都二百万人民的生计，和关系首都今后的建设，而且从日伪以来，即已实行公营，并有绝大部分资本属于公产，决不应再交给私人经营。现在，有人以该公司董事名义要求政府发还。我想：即使我们同意，北京二百万人民也是要反对的。当然，私人股权应该承认和清理，并采取适当办法，加以处理。第二、整顿下水道，使污水有所排泄，首先是掏挖和整修旧沟，其次，是筹筑必要的新沟；第三、改善环境卫生，彻底清除垃圾和粪便，同时，调整医院、卫生事务所和诊疗所的分布状况，并尽可能改进，充实和增设，以便利市民医疗；第四、采取以工代赈等办法，动员大量人力，修筑道路，疏浚河渠。关于进行这些工作，各主管部门已拟具计划，有的，且已开始实施。
    为了实现上述市政建设方针，势须支付相当巨额的经费。因此，整理税收，实有必要，北京市民的负担还不可能减轻。但我们是采取着“取之于人民”，“用之于人民”的方针，决不浪费一文钱。在市政府的预算中，事业费所占的比例，是相当大的。今年下半年的预算，事业费已占总支出的百分之四十点一八，预备费内所用于事业费的尚不计算在内。正在编制的明年度预算，事业费拟更增加到岁出总额的百分之五十稍强。
    根据人民政治协商会议共同纲领第三章第十四条“在普选的地方人民代表大会召开以前，由地方各界人民代表会议，逐步地，代行人民代表大会职权”的规定，我们已呈请中央人民政府批准，由本届会议以选举方式，产生新的北京市人民政府。我相信我们的方针和计划，如经会议采择，这个新的北京市人民政府将会执行。
