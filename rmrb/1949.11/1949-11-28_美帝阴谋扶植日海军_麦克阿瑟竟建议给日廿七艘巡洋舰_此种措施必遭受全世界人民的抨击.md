　　U.S. Imperialism Conspires to Support the Japanese Navy
    MacArthur Actually Suggests Giving Japan Twenty-Seven Cruisers
    Such Measures Will Inevitably Be Criticized by People Worldwide
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 27th] Under the guise of "strengthening Japan's coastal defense," MacArthur's headquarters is actively arming the Japanese navy. According to a dispatch from Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, November 22nd, citing reliable sources: The American authorities in Tokyo have suggested to Washington that twenty-seven cruisers, which were wartime lend-lease to the Soviet Union and recently returned to the United States, be given to the Japanese coastal defense forces. The suggestion stipulates that these cruisers, currently docked at Yokosuka naval port, along with their military equipment, including machine guns, three-inch caliber cannons, and equipment for laying underwater bombs, be handed over to Japan. MacArthur's move to support Japanese militarism will undoubtedly be criticized by peace-loving people around the world. The same dispatch, quoting the aforementioned sources, also admitted that "foreign and some American public opinion may have a negative reaction to this."

　　美帝阴谋扶植日海军
    麦克阿瑟竟建议给日廿七艘巡洋舰
    此种措施必遭受全世界人民的抨击
    【新华社北京二十七日电】麦克阿瑟总部正在“加强日本海岸防御”的掩盖下，积极地武装日本的海军。据法新社东京二十二日电引可靠方面人士称：东京美国当局已向华盛顿建议，将苏联战时租借的并于最近归还美国的巡洋舰二十七只，交给日本海岸防御部队。该建议规定将这些现泊于横须贺军港的巡洋舰，连同其军事装备，包括机关枪、三英寸口径大炮和敷设水底炸弹的设备在内，一并交给日本。麦克阿瑟此种扶植日本军国主义的措施，无疑必将遭受世界爱好和平人民的抨击。同电所引该方面人士也承认：“外国和美国部分舆论对此可能有不好反应”。
