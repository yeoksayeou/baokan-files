    Section Three: Marxist-Leninist Political Economy and the Chinese Revolution
    Not only during the Soviet period and the War of Resistance Against Japan, but also during the three years of the People's Liberation War. Our work in military affairs, politics, economy, culture, education, mass movements, Party affairs, and other aspects is closely related to Marxist-Leninist political economy. Now, the People's Republic of China is forming a unified national situation. In addition to the vast rural areas across the country, the Chinese people already possess or will possess thousands of cities nationwide, several world-famous large and small cities, and modern railways, highways, extensive coastlines with many important ports connecting these cities and connecting cities with the countryside. We now have not only a semi-self-sufficient rural economy but also urban economies with highly developed or relatively highly developed commodity economies. After the People's Liberation Army victoriously crossed the Yangtze River and successively liberated the Northeast, North China, East China, and the Central Plains, the focus of the Communist Party's work shifted from the countryside to the cities. In the economies of the Northeast and North China liberated areas, a shift was made from wartime economies to peacetime economies. In addition to the principle of considering both public and private interests and benefiting both labor and capital, the policy of mutual assistance between urban and rural areas and internal and external exchanges was added to the agenda, forming the Communist Party's new all-round policy. Therefore, in the new democratic revolution, the revolution promoted economic development, and the economy promoted the revolution's progress. Politics and economics are thus interconnected and interact.

    Now, let's examine the relationship between political economy and the various important departments of revolutionary work:

    Political Economy and the Revolutionary Regime's Work

    The New Democratic economy is a product of the Chinese revolution and of the revolutionary regime. The central issue of the revolution is the armed seizure of power. At the same time, the people's regime is built on a certain economic foundation. The basic task of the People's Democratic Government, before the end of the revolutionary war, is "to develop production and ensure supply," ensuring the complete victory of the revolutionary war. After the victorious end of the revolutionary war, the basic task is to "develop production and prosper the economy," building an independent, free, democratic, unified, and prosperous new China, and preparing all the material conditions to transition to socialism. In the course of the revolution, the revolutionary government must carry out a series of tasks: abolish the old feudal and semi-feudal relations of production, abolish the bureaucratic capitalist relations of production, abolish imperialist privileges in China, break away from imperialist bondage and the dependence of the Chinese economy on imperialism, oppose imperialist economic aggression, appropriately transform the old capitalist relations of production, liberate the productive forces of the people, and build, consolidate, and develop new democratic relations of production, so that the revolution, after the victory of the political revolution, obtains the guarantee of the victory of the economic revolution, thereby enabling China to advance from the level of a backward agricultural country to the level of a modern industrial country. In these tasks of the regime, the armament of Marxist-Leninist political economy is completely necessary. For example, in carrying out the land reform work to abolish feudal and semi-feudal relations of production in agriculture, we must first delineate the classes in the countryside. To delineate the classes in the countryside, we must first start from a concrete, profound, and meticulous investigation, research, analysis and dissection of the rural socio-economic structure. For example, in carrying out the work of restoring and developing industry and commerce in cities, in addition to having a meticulous and thorough investigation and research on the characteristics of the relations of production of urban industry and commerce, the scope of business, the nature of industrial and commercial capital, the composition of capital, and labor-capital relations, we must also have a concrete and in-depth understanding and mastery of the processes, conditions of production, exchange, distribution, and consumption in various industries and forms in the city, that is, the sources of raw materials, sales of finished products, labor conditions, production equipment, as well as capital, profits, and other issues. These cannot be done without a certain degree of Marxist-Leninist political economy knowledge.

    In the composition of the People's Democratic regime, in addition to the leading component of the working class and the main body of the worker-peasant laboring masses, people from other revolutionary classes of society also participate. Therefore, in addition to how to give full play to the leading role of the proletariat politically, consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, and win over and unite other revolutionary classes, it is also necessary to understand how to rely economically on the working class and other working people, and on their creativity and initiative, organize mutual assistance between urban and rural economies, and more firmly consolidate the foundation of the worker-peasant alliance from the economic perspective; and, under the principle of considering both public and private interests and benefiting both labor and capital, form a united front with the bourgeoisie that has both unity and struggle; how to operate and develop the state-owned economy and give full play to its leading role; how to organize and support the cooperative economy and make them the two main levers in the entire New Democratic national economy; how to organize the development of private capitalist economies that are beneficial to the people's livelihood, and how to encourage private capital to develop in the direction of state capitalism, how to lead, organize, and transform the small commodity economy of peasants and handicraftsmen, and guide them to develop into cooperative economies to overcome their scattered, anarchic state and blindness in production; these are the basic tasks of the regime during and after the revolution. They all need the weapons of Marxist-Leninist political economy to arm them.

    The above only addresses the relationship between the basic aspects of the work of the regime and political economy. In addition, the military, financial, mass movement, cultural, educational, diplomatic, judicial, public security, and Party affairs work in the work of the regime are directly or indirectly related to the promotion and development of the social economy.

    Political Economy and Revolutionary Military Work

    War is the highest expression of the economic contradictions of class society - class contradictions. Revolutionary war can play a catalytic and promoting role in the emergence and development of a new society and a new social economy.

    Everyone knows that the characteristic of the modern Chinese revolution is "armed people against armed counter-revolution." This "characteristic of the Chinese revolution is also an advantage" (Stalin), which is basically due to the local agricultural characteristics of the modern Chinese economic structure and the characteristics of the modern Chinese social political structure arising therefrom. But to make a revolution, there must be revolutionary armed forces - a revolutionary army - to carry out armed struggle, persist in armed struggle, defeat the enemy, eliminate the enemy, and achieve the final victory of the revolution. However, to have a revolutionary army, there must be a revolutionary military supply. This military supply directly supports the armed struggle and directly relies on the economic construction work in the rear of the war, becoming a very important department in the revolutionary military work. Therefore, Comrade Mao Zedong put forward "develop production, ensure supply" as the basic guideline for the financial and economic work of the People's Democratic regime during the revolutionary war, and at the same time, it became the basic task of the wartime revolutionary regime. Now, our war is no longer comparable in scale to the civil war period or the Anti-Japanese War period, but has greatly expanded. The battle has also changed from the past guerrilla warfare to large-scale mobile warfare, offensive warfare, and large-corps operations. Therefore, its needs in terms of military supply and the transportation conditions for realizing this military supply are also very different from the past. Just in terms of the supply of military needs, large-corps operations, especially offensive operations to seize large cities, how to organize all manpower, material resources, and financial resources to support the front line and ensure the victory of the war is an extremely complex and enormous task. It is completely different from the era of small-corps activities in the past when guerrilla warfare could be supplied locally. Marx once said in a letter to Engels in 1867: "The history of the army more clearly than anything else shows our connection between productive forces and social relations" (Selected Letters of Marx and Engels, Marx to Engels, September 25, 1857). In class society, war has its economic inevitability. It is the total contest of various social forces such as the economy, politics, culture, and science, and is also restricted by the degree of socio-economic development. Therefore, scientific military strategists and military workers must have a certain knowledge of political economy, which is completely necessary for our revolutionary military strategists and military workers today.

  　第三章　政治经济学的任务意义与中国革命
    第三节　马列主义政治经济学与中国革命
    不但苏维埃时期，和抗日战争时期是这样，人民解放战争的三年，也都是这样。我们的军事、政治、经济、文化教育、群运、党务等各方面的工作，都与马列主义政治经济学有着极密切的关系。现在中华人民共和国，正形成着全国统一的局面，除了广大全国范围的农村以外，中国人民已拥有或将拥有数以千计的全国城市、与世界有名的若干大小城市及联结这些城市和城市与乡村的近代铁路、公路、交通漫长的海岸线，多数的重要港口，我们现在不仅只有半自给自足的农村经济，而且还有商品经济高度发达或较高度发达的城市经济了。在人民解放军胜利渡江，东北，华北，华东，中原先后完全解放以后，共产党的工作重点已由乡村转向城市，在东北，华北各解放区的经济，由战时经济转向平时经济，除公私兼顾，劳资两利以外，城乡互助，内外交流的方针又增进了议事日程，而形成了共产党的新的四面八方政策。故在新民主主义革命中，革命推动了经济的发展，经济又推动了革命的前进，政治与经济是这样血胤相连地交互作用着。
    现在我们再从革命工作的各个重要部门，来看政治经济学对于它们的关系：
    政治经济学与革命的政权工作
    新民主主义的经济，是中国革命的产物，是革命政权的产物。革命的中心问题是武装夺取政权问题。同时人民的政权，它是建立在一定的经济基础上面的。人民民主政府的任务，在革命战争未结束以前，基本的是“发展生产，保障供给”，保障革命战争的彻底胜利，在革命战争胜利结束以后，基本的是在“发展生产，繁荣经济”，建设一个独立自由民主统一富强的新中国，并准备一切物质条件，过渡到社会主义去，在革命过程中，革命政府必须进行一系列的工作，废除旧的封建的与半封建的生产关系，废除官僚资本主义的生产关系，废除帝国主义的在华特权，摆脱帝国主义的羁绊与中国经济对帝国主义的依赖性，反对帝国主义的经济侵略，适当改造旧的资本主义的生产关系，解放人民大众的生产力，建设巩固与发展新民主主义的生产关系，使革命在政治革命胜利以后，得到经济革命胜利的保证，从而使中国从落后的农业国的水平进到近代工业国的水平。在这些政权工作中都是完全需要着马列主义政治经济学的武装，例如在进行废除农业中封建与半封建的生产关系的土地改革工作中，我们首先就要划清农村中的阶级，要划清农村中的阶级，则要首先从对农村社会经济结构进行具体深刻与缜密周详的调查研究、解剖分析出发。又如在城市中进行恢复与发展工商业工作，除了必须对城市工商业的生产关系特点、经营范围、工商业资本的性质、资本构成、劳资关系等各方面有缜密周详的调查研究以外，还必须对城市各种行业各种形式的生产、交换、分配与消费的过程、状况即原料来源，成品销售、劳动条件、生产设备，以及资本、利润等等各种问题，都必须有具体深入的了解掌握。这些都不是没有一定的马列主义政治经济学知识的修养所能做到的。
    在人民民主政权的构成上，除了工人阶级的领导成份和主体的工农劳动人民大众以外，还有社会其他各革命阶级的人民参加。因此除了政治上如何发挥无产阶级的领导作用，巩固工农联盟，争取与团结其他各革命阶级以外，同时还必须懂得怎么样在经济上依靠工人阶级与其他劳动人民，和他们的创造性、主动性的发挥，组织城乡经济的互助，从经济上更加巩固地密切工农联盟的基础；并在公私兼顾劳资两利的原则下，与资产阶级结成既有团结又有斗争的统一战线；怎样经营与发展国营经济，充分发挥其领导作用，怎样组织与扶助合作社经济，并使他们成为整个新民主主义国民经济中的两个主要杠杆；怎样组织那些有利于国民生计的私人资本主义经济的发展，并怎样鼓励私人资本向国家资本主义方向发展，怎么样领导组织与改造农民与手工业者的小商品经济，并引导它们向合作社经济发展，以克服他们的散漫无政府状态和生产上的盲目性，这些都是革命中与革命胜利后政权工作的基本任务。也都是需要马列主义政治经济学的武器来武装的。
    以上只是就政权工作的基本的方面与政治经济学的关系来说的。此外政权工作中的军事、财经、群众运动、文化教育以及外交司法公安党务等各方面工作，对于社会经济的促进发展，都有着直接的或间接的关系。
    政治经济学与革命的军事工作
    战争是阶级社会经济矛盾——阶级矛盾的最高表现形式，革命的战争对于新社会与新的社会经济的产生发展能起催生与促进的作用。
    谁都知道：近代中国革命的特点，就是“武装的人民反对武装的反革命”，这一“中国革命的特点同时是优点”（斯大林），基本上也是由于近代中国经济结构地方性的农业底特点与由此而产生的近代中国社会的政治结构的特点所产生的。但要革命，必须要有革命的武装——革命的军队，才能进行武装斗争，坚持武装斗争，并战胜敌人，消灭敌人，取得革命的最后胜利。但是要有革命军队，就必要有革命的军事供给，这种军事的供给，直接地支持着武装斗争，并直接地依靠于战争后方的经济建设工作，成为革命的军事工作中的极重要的一个部门。故毛泽东同志很早就提出“发展生产，保障供给”，作为人民民主政权革命战争时期财政经济工作的基本方针，同时成为战时革命政权的基本任务。现在我们的战争，在规模上已经不是内战时期，也不是抗日时期所可比拟，已大大地扩大了，在战斗上也早已由过去的游击战转变为大规模的运动战、攻坚战、大兵团作战，因此它在军事供给方面的需要以及实现这种军事供应的交通运输条件，也早已与过去不大相同。单就军事需要的供应言，大兵团的作战，尤其是夺取大城市的攻坚作战，怎样组织一切人力物力与财力来支援前线，保证战争的胜利，乃是一个极其复杂极其浩大的工作。它与过去游击战争可以就地取给的小兵团活动时代已经完全不一样了。一八六七年马克思给恩克斯的信中曾经说过：“军队的历史比任何事物都更明显地显示着我们的关于生产力和社会关系的联系”（马恩通信选集一八五七年九月二十五日马克思给恩格思的信），这一观点底完全正确性。在阶级社会里，战争有它经济的必然性，它是集合经济的政治的文化的科学的诸种社会力量的总角力，同时又为社会经济发展的程度所制约，所以科学的军事家、军事工作者必须具有一定的政治经济学的知识，它对于今天我们革命的军事家、军事工作者，乃是完全必要的。
