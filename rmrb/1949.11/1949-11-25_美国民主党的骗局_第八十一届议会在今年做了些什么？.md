　　The Democratic Party's Scam
　　-- What Did the Eighty-First Congress Do This Year?
　　Duan Liancheng

　　Before last winter's US presidential election, the Democratic candidate Truman cleverly gave the then Republican-controlled Eightieth Congress a nickname: "The Do-Nothing Congress." He bragged to the people everywhere that he wanted to do good things all the time, but that "Do-Nothing" Congress did not pass the good laws he wanted. Therefore, as long as he was re-elected as president, and a Democratic-majority Congress was elected, it would definitely accomplish great things and benefit the people. After the November 2nd election, Truman won the election. Now, he has been president for eleven months, and the Democratic-majority Eighty-First Congress adjourned on October 19th. Taking stock of the legislative record of this Congress over the past ten months, it can be said that it is still "do-nothing" in matters beneficial to the people's lives. However, it has done all kinds of evil in preparing for war and expanding the military.

　　　　The So-Called "Fair Deal"

　　Before the election, Truman's reputation was known to be low. The most "authoritative" New York Times even used an entire page of statistical charts the day before the election to definitively say that Truman would definitely fail. Even politicians within the Democratic Party openly expressed their contempt for him. At the Democratic presidential nomination convention, everyone said they didn't want Truman. One person exclaimed that Truman was his "second choice." When others asked who his first choice was, he replied: "Anyone will do."

　　But in the most urgent weeks before the election, Truman suddenly came up with a set of policies similar to the late President Roosevelt's "New Deal," beautifully calling it the "Fair Deal." He promised the people that he would abolish the Taft-Hartley Act that oppressed labor; that he would pass a bill to protect the human rights of blacks; that he would implement rent control and price controls; that the government would pay for the popularization of education; establish a free medical health insurance system; raise the minimum wage, expand unemployment insurance, and a long list of very pleasant legislative programs. Taking his wife Bess and daughter Margaret, Truman traveled everywhere, bragging hundreds of times, shaking hands and patting shoulders with more than a million people, and agreeing with Democratic party bosses everywhere on the positions and remuneration he would assign to them after he was elected.

　　Many American people listened to Truman's elaborate lies and mistakenly believed them to be true, voting for the Democratic Party. At the same time, some of those who had originally decided to vote for Wallace's Progressive Party temporarily thought that the Progressive Party would not be elected anyway, and it would be better to "choose the lesser of two evils" and change their votes to Truman. Most importantly, the manipulation and fraud of party machinery in various places, and the disenfranchisement of a large number of people (mainly blacks and workers). As a result, Truman was unexpectedly elected, and the majority of seats in the Senate and House of Representatives also fell into the hands of the Democratic Party.

　　　　Still "Do-Nothing"

　　On January 3rd, a grand presidential inauguration ceremony was held in Washington. Truman kissed the Bible and swore to serve the people. He stepped into the White House, and the Democratic-controlled Congress also convened. Did Truman fulfill his promise to serve the people? The first test was the Taft-Hartley Labor Act.

　　This labor law was enacted in 1947. The main drafter was the most reactionary Republican leader, Senator Taft of Ohio. The bill included many measures to oppress labor, including prohibiting workers from striking before the expiration of contracts with employers; allowing the president to ask the court to issue an injunction when strikes that "threaten national health and safety" occur; prohibiting union funds from being used for political purposes; union leaders must declare in writing that they are not communists, etc. The American labor masses naturally hated this bill to the bone. Shortly after the bill was passed by Congress, the son of the proposer Taft got married in a small town, and the nearby workers, regardless of the police's suppression, carried many signs to demonstrate around the church where the wedding was held. The signs read: "Tell your father, we hate him." In a union election of directors at a congress of industrial organizations, one of the candidates also happened to be named Taft. When his name was proposed for voting, the whole audience booed, and this innocent Taft was defeated.

　　Truman, targeting this psychology of the people, shouted everywhere during the campaign that the Democratic Party advocated abolishing this law. After the opening of the Eighty-First Congress, labor leader Marcantonio, wanting the Democratic Party to fulfill this promise, proposed in the House of Representatives to abolish the Taft Act and restore the more enlightened Wagner Labor Act of the Roosevelt era. The Democratic congressmen had long forgotten their promises to the people. Marcantonio's proposal was quickly rejected. The so-called Wood Act, which only changed the name of the Taft Act while maintaining all of its substance, was initially passed by a vote of 217 to 203. In order to deceive the masses, Truman tried to refer the labor law issue to a subcommittee for temporary shelving. In this way, the first check that Truman gave to the people became a bounced one.

　　The second issue was rent control. After the war, no new houses were added in the United States, and young people gradually formed families, needing a lot of houses. When a large number of veterans returned home, the housing shortage became a common and serious problem. Real estate companies and landlords with a large number of properties hoarded them, raising rents. Even today, flipping through the classified ads in any newspaper, you can always see countless ads seeking housing. As for ads for rent, not only are the prices high, but they are often accompanied by a long list of unreasonable conditions. A typical example: "One and a half rooms, rent only to whites, no children, no cats or dogs, twenty-five dollars a week." The people could not stand the exploitation and bullying of the landlords, and unanimously demanded government regulation. Truman had promised this.

　　The proposal to control rents caused a great disturbance in Congress. The result was the passage of a bill that nicely said: "In principle" rents were to be controlled, but whether to control them or not would be decided by the local authorities. According to this bill, many state and city governments quickly abolished the controls, and rents rose sharply. In the few places that did not abolish them, landlords held "strikes," evicting tenants and leaving the houses empty. A large character "Rent" sign was posted on the door, with a small "No" written in the upper left corner and "If rent control continues" in the lower right corner, so that those who were homeless could see it from afar and run over, then leave in anger, so as to retaliate. There are homeless people wandering the streets everywhere. Truman's second check was also a bounced one.

　　The third is the so-called "Human Rights Bill." It is a fact known throughout the world that blacks, who make up one-tenth of the US population, are discriminated against and oppressed. In the South, they cannot mix with whites in all public places; the "poll tax" deprives them of their right to vote; the "lynching" (killing without legal judgment), commonly used by Ku Klux Klan members and hooligans, threatens their lives; in daily life, they do not even have the right to be called "Mr." Economic discrimination, such as equal work for unequal pay, and letting blacks do things like washing toilets and mopping floors, is a consistent situation throughout the United States. Truman also promised to find a way to deal with this matter, and even came up with a concrete "Human Rights Bill" to lure black votes.

　　In the Eighty-First Congress, this human rights bill was not even proposed. On the contrary, not many days after Truman took office, a cruel "lynching" incident occurred in Georgia. A black man named Mallard was envied by his white neighbors for saving money to buy a new car. One night, on the way home with his wife, he was killed by several Ku Klux Klan members. Afterwards, the case was brought to court, and the jurors were all white. The only witness to Mallard's killing was his wife, and according to Southern practice, the testimony of blacks is insufficient. The jurors then declared "insufficient evidence" and acquitted the murderers. Similarly, the beating incident at the black singer Robeson's concert occurred in New York. Norman, the editor of the Daily Worker, was beaten by twenty policemen who were "maintaining order." One of them even trampled on his burned and bandaged fingers with his foot. Truman and the Democratic congressmen turned a deaf ear to these events. The "Human Rights Bill" check was also a bounced one.

　　The fourth issue is the health insurance system. There are a total of 190,000 doctors in the United States, theoretically one doctor for every 770 people. But according to the New York Times, there is only one doctor for every 19,000 blacks in the Mississippi area. In addition to the shortage of doctors, medical expenses are even more expensive. In that "free competition" society, doctors can take advantage of others' difficulties and charge unlimited prices. Therefore, working people often become heavily indebted once they get sick.

　　Truman proposed health insurance in Congress. The method was that all workers and employees would regularly have a sum of money deducted from their salaries, and the employer would also pay a portion. Once they got sick, the expenses would be paid from this fund, and they would receive free treatment. In this way, doctors would of course not be able to "compete freely," and they would not be able to make money freely. The reactionary American Medical Association immediately raised three million US dollars to lobby the congressmen in Washington to oppose this bill. At the same time, the powerful DuPont financial group, because the public medical system would reduce the profits of their drug monopoly enterprises, also secretly used its power to oppose it. Truman and the congressmen naturally did not dare to disobey and shelved the "health insurance" that had been hyped up for a while. Thus, this check also became a bounced one.

　　The fifth issue is price controls. During the war, the American workers and farmers saved money and saved up some money. After the armistice, prices rose steadily. Last August and September, it reached its peak. Food prices rose by 216.8% compared to 1939. Other prices also rose by about 70%. Therefore, Truman and the Democratic Party shouted for price controls. Once they got power, they said that prices were already falling and did not need to be controlled. It is true that the United States is currently suffering from overproduction, and many commodities are being sold at discounted prices. But for the daily necessities that are most closely related to the people, although wholesale prices are decreasing, retail prices on the market have not changed significantly. For example, eggs that sold for a little more than three dimes a dozen before the war rose to more than nine dimes at the highest, and recently still sell for around eight dimes. The masses of people whose purchasing power is sharply declining still deeply feel the high pressure of prices. And the "price control" check that Truman gave them had long become a bounced one.

　　In addition to the above, many of the Democratic Party's "Fair Deal" promises were either not proposed in Congress at all; some were proposed and debated for a while, and then nothing came of it; the few laws that were passed were all perfunctory and greatly discounted. On the good side, the Democratic-controlled Eighty-First Congress was still do-nothing. On the bad side, it was no less than the Republican Eightieth Congress.

　　　　Doing All Kinds of Evil

　　The biggest "achievement" of the Eighty-First Congress was the passage of the huge military budget. Not many days after Truman came to power, he submitted the budget to Congress. The total expenditure for the 1949 fiscal year was 42.2 billion US dollars, and military spending accounted for 15.2 billion. In other words, almost four dimes out of every dollar were used to prepare for war. The congressmen did not argue as much about this budget as they did about the "Fair Deal," but quickly passed it with unprecedented enthusiasm and unity. Only one dissenting vote was cast by Marcantonio of the Labor Party, the only progressive representative in Congress. Not only that, the congressmen also allocated an additional 600 million US dollars to expand the air force. Chairman Cannon of the Appropriations Committee said: "We will bomb the center of the war, and then let our allies send troops - send other people's children, not our children." The congressmen's war enthusiasm and the true face of America's "allies" are vividly expressed in these words.

　　The second "achievement" of the Eighty-First Congress was the passage of the second year's appropriation for the "Marshall Plan." The so-called "Marshall Plan" is ostensibly aimed at "European economic recovery." In fact, it is the United States' economic enslavement of Western European countries. The economic situation of Western European countries is deteriorating due to the dumping of American goods caused by the "Marshall Plan." The concrete manifestations, to name a few major ones, are the British dollar crisis, the economic difficulties of France; the three million unemployed people in Italy and the 1.5 million unemployed people in West Germany; in Belgium, a small country with a population of six million, there are as many as 300,000 unemployed people.

　　The Eighty-First Congress seemed very benevolent and passed a "Foreign Aid Act," appropriating 5.8 billion and 9.99 million US dollars, including more than 4.85 billion yuan for the second year of the "Marshall Plan," and the rest used for occupation expenses in Germany and Japan and aid to Greece and Turkey. Why did the Democratic Congress so generously allocate funds to "aid" foreign countries? The reason is that this money is anyway the tax paid by the American people with blood and sweat. When this money is given to foreign countries, it is conditional on them taking this money to the United States to buy goods. In this way, a large amount of the American people's money is transferred into the pockets of manufacturers and capitalists. At the same time, this also helps to alleviate their problem of overproduction. In addition, this "gold dollar diplomacy" policy can turn Marshallized countries into appendages of American imperialism's war preparations and aggression. Similar in nature to the "Marshall Plan" is the "Technical Assistance to Underdeveloped Areas Plan," which has been approved in principle by Congress. This plan is to enable American imperialist forces to take the opportunity to invade all underdeveloped colonies and semi-colonies in the world.

　　The third achievement of the Eighty-First Congress was the ratification of the "North Atlantic Treaty." At 3:00 PM on April 4th, the foreign ministers of twelve countries signed the "North Atlantic Treaty" in Washington. The American rulers beautifully call it a "defensive treaty." In fact, as Wallace said: "How would we feel if the Soviet Union had a military base on the Mexican border, or in Cuba? ... To say that the North Atlantic Treaty is an instrument of peace is an outright lie." But the Senate, after some inconsequential debate, finally ratified this "treaty."

　　Next, Truman sent a proposal to Congress for military aid to the signatory countries of the "North Atlantic Treaty." The so-called "1949 Mutual Defense Assistance Act" was passed by the Senate and House of Representatives on September 28th. An appropriation of 1.314 billion and 10,000 yuan, in addition to using 1 billion to arm the "allied countries," the rest was divided among the Kuomintang remnants, and the reactionary governments of Greece, Turkey, South Korea, Iran, and the Philippines. In this way, the government naturally needs to order a large number of munitions, and munitions merchants can make a fortune, while other monopoly enterprises can also be partially converted to munitions manufacturing, in an attempt to temporarily alleviate the problem of overproduction.

　　On the night that the "North Atlantic Treaty" was signed, a radio station in Chicago broadcast an interview. A housewife was asked which countries were signatories to the "North Atlantic Treaty." She said the United States, and couldn't think of a second one. The interviewer said: "Madam, I must say you are quite ignorant of current affairs." She said: "What I care about is that milk has risen from two dimes to two dimes and one cent a quart, and rent is going up again. I have no interest in any treaty or alliance." This is typical of the good American people. They have once again fallen into the great scam of the Truman government, which represents the big capitalists, and the Democratic Congress.

　　The politicians and party bosses of the American bourgeoisie boast loudly during the election, deceiving the people to get votes. Once they come to power, they forget the election promises completely - this is the characteristic of American so-called "democratic" politics. Truman's scam is a clear example.

　　美国民主党的骗局
　　——第八十一届议会在今年做了些什么？
　　段连城
    去冬美国总统大选之前，民主党的候选人杜鲁门，很巧妙地替当时共和党控制的第八十届国会，起了一个外号：“一事无成的国会”。他处处对老百姓吹牛屁说，他自己无时无刻不想做好事，但是那个“一事无成的”国会没有通过他所要的好法律。因此，只要再选他做总统，另外选出一个民主党占多数的国会，一定大有作为，造福人民。十一月二日大选之后，杜鲁门竞选胜利了，到如今，他做了总统已经十一个月，民主党占多数的第八十一届议会已于十月十九日闭会。清算一下这届国会十个月来的立法纪录，在有益人民生活的事情上，可说依然是“一事无成”。而在备战扩军上，却是无恶不作。
    　　　　所谓“公平之政”
    在大选前的杜鲁门，声望之低，是人所共知的。最“权威”的纽约时报，大选前一天还用一整页统计图表，确定地说杜鲁门一定失败。就是民主党内的政客也公开地对他表示轻视。在民主党总统候选人的提名大会上，人人说不要杜鲁门，有一个人却大呼杜鲁门是他的“第二个选择”。别人问谁是他的第一个选择，他答道：“不论那个都成。”
    但是杜鲁门在大选前最紧急的几个星期内，他突然搬出了一套近似故总统罗斯福的“新政”的政纲，美其名曰“公平之政”。他答应老百姓，要废除压迫劳工的塔虎脱——哈特利法案；要通过保护黑人的人权法案；要实行房租管制，物价管制；要政府出钱普及教育；建立免费医药的健康保险制度；提高最低工资，扩大失业保险及其他一长串非常动听的立法纲领。带着老婆白茜，女儿玛嘉丽德，杜鲁门到处奔走，吹了几百次的牛屁，和百万以上的人握过手，拍过肩头，和各地的民主党党棍讲妥了他当选后委派给他们的职位报酬。
    美国的老百姓们，有不少人听了杜鲁门一大套天花乱坠的谎言，误信为真，投民主党的票。同时，原来决定投华莱士进步党票的，有些人临时认为进步党反正选不上，莫若“两害相权取其轻”，改投了杜鲁门的票。最主要的，是各地党棍机关的操纵和舞弊，及大批人民（主要为黑人和工人）被剥削投票权。这样一来，杜氏竟意外地当选了，参众两院的多数席位，也落到民主党手中。
    　　　　依然“一事无成”
    一月三日华盛顿举行了盛大的总统就职典礼。杜鲁门吻过圣经，宣誓服务人民。他跨进白宫，民主党控制的国会也开会。杜鲁门是否履行诺言服务人民呢？第一个考验就是塔虎脱劳工法案。
    这个劳工法案，是一九四七年制定的。主要的起草人，是最反动的共和党领袖、俄亥俄州参议员塔虎脱。法案中包括了许多压迫劳工的办法，包括不许工人在与资方的契约满期前罢工；在所谓“威胁全国健康与安全”的罢工发生时，总统得请法院下令禁止；工会基金不得作政治用途，工会领袖必须书面声明不是共产党员等等。对这个法案，美国的劳工大众自然是恨之入骨的。在国会通过该法案后不久，提案人塔虎脱的儿子在一个小城结婚，附近的劳工，不顾警察的弹压，抬着许多纸牌，到行婚礼的教堂四周去示威。牌上写道：“告诉你老子，我们恨他。”在产联有一次代表大会的理事选举中，有一个候选人也姓塔虎脱。当他的名字被提付表决时，全场嘘声四起，这个无辜的塔虎脱竟然落选。
    杜鲁门针对老百姓这种心理，竞选中处处嚷着民主党主张废除这项法律。在八十一届国会开幕之后，劳工党领袖麦堪东尼奥，要民主党履行此一诺言，在众议院提议废除塔虎脱法，恢复罗斯福时代的比较开明的魏格纳劳工法案。国会里的民主党议员们，早已把对老百姓的诺言忘得一干二净。麦氏的提案迅速地遭到否决。而所谓伍德法案，它只换了塔虎脱法案的名字，而保持了其一切实质，却被以二一七对二○三票初步通过。为了欺骗群众，杜鲁门设法把劳工法案的问题交付小组，暂时搁置。如此，杜鲁门开给老百姓的第一张支票，成了空头。
    第二桩是房租问题。美国在大战发生以后，新屋没有增加，而年轻人渐渐成家，需要很多的房子。当大批退伍军人返乡的时候，房荒便成为一个普遍而严重的问题。拥有大批房产的地产公司及房东们，奇货可居，高抬租金。直到今日，翻开任何一个报纸的分类小广告，总看见无数征求住房的启事。若于召租的广告，不但要价高，多半还附有一大串不合理的条件，典型例子：“一间半，仅租白人，无小孩，无猫狗，二十五元一周。”老百姓们受不住房主们的剥削欺负，一致要求政府管制。杜鲁门曾经一口应承。
    管制房租的提议，在国会大闹一通。结果通过一项法案，漂亮地说：“原则上”管制房租，究竟管与不管，由各个地方当局决定。依据这法案，许多州政府及市政府，很快地取消了管制，房租大涨。在少数没有取消的地方，房主们举行了“罢工”，把房客赶出去，房子空着不租人。大门上还贴一个大字“召租”条子，在左上角注一个小小的“不”字，右下角写着：“如果房租管制还要继续”，让那些无家可归的人，远远看见跑来，然后气忿而去，如此以作报复。流浪街头的无房子可容身的人，随处皆有。杜鲁门的第二张支票，又成了空头。
    第三是所谓“人权法案”。占美国人口中十分之一的黑人，被歧视压迫，是举世所共知的事实。在南方，他们在一切公共场所，不能和白人混淆；“人头税”剥夺了他们的选举权；三Ｋ党徒及流氓所惯用的“私刑”（不依法判决而擅自杀人），威胁着他们的生命安全；在日常生活中，他们甚至于没有被称呼为“先生”的权利。而经济上的歧视，如象同工不同酬，洗马桶拖地板等事专让黑人干等等，则是全美一致的情形。这件事，杜鲁门也满口答应，一定设法，而且还搬出一套具体的“人权法案”，诱引黑人的选票。
    在第八十一届议会中，这个人权法案连提都没有提出。相反地，在杜鲁门就职后没有几天，乔治亚州发生了一桩残忍的“私刑”事件。一个名马拉德的黑人，因为积钱买了一辆新汽车，遂遭到邻居白人的忌妒，有一天夜里，在他与老婆开车回家的途中，被几个三Ｋ党徒杀死。事后告到法院，陪审官尽是白人，目击马拉德被杀的只有他的老婆，而按南方的惯例，黑人的证明是不足为凭的，陪审官们遂宣告“证据不足”，而将凶手无罪开释。同样的，在纽约又发生了黑人歌王罗伯逊音乐会上的殴打事件。工人日报的编辑诺曼，受到二十个“维持秩序”的警察围打。其中一个，竟用脚践踏他烧伤了缠着绷带的指头。对这些事，杜鲁门及民主党的议员们，置若罔闻。“人权法案”的支票，也是空头。
    第四桩是健康保险制度。在美国共有医生十九万人，照理论上说每七百七十人中有一个医生。但据纽约时报统计，象密西西比一带的黑人，每一万九千人中才有医生一人。除医生少，更加医药费贵，在那个“自由竞争”的社会里，医生们可以趁人之危，漫无限制的要价。因此劳动人民们一旦生病，往往负债累累。
    杜鲁门在国会提出了健康保险。办法是所有工人雇员，经常从薪津内扣除一笔钱，同时资方也出一部分。一旦生病，则由这笔基金开支，免费治疗。如此一来，医生们当然不能“自由竞争”，也就不能自由赚钱了。反动的美国医师公会，立刻募集了三百万元美金，到华盛顿议员中进行活动，反对这项法案。同时有力的杜邦财阀集团，因为公医制度势将减少他们的药品独占企业的利润，也暗中用力反对。杜鲁门及议员们，当然不敢违抗，把渲染一时的“健康保险”搁开不提。如此，这一张支票也成了空头。
    第五桩是物价管制。在大战期间，美国工农大众省吃俭用，存起几个钱。停战之后，物价节节上涨。去年八九月，达到最高峰。食品价格，比一九三九年涨了百分之二一六·八。其他物价，也上升了百分之七十左右。因此杜鲁门及民主党遂高叫物价管制。一旦政权到手，他们说物价已在下跌，不需管制了。不错，美国今天正闹生产过剩，许多商品都在削价出售。但是对老百姓最切身的日用必需品，批发价虽在降低，而市面零售价却没有显著变动。譬如战前卖三毛多一打的鸡蛋，最高涨到九毛多，最近还是卖八毛上下。购买力在锐减的人民大众，依旧深感到物价的高压。而杜鲁门开给他们的“管制物价”支票，早已成了空头。
    除上述以外，民主党的许多“公平之政”的诺言，有的根本没有在国会提出；有的提出后争吵一番，不了了之；少数获得通过的几项法律，又都是敷衍塞责，打了大大的折扣，在好事的一方面呢，民主党控制的第八十一届议会依然一事无成。而在坏事的一方面呢，比起共和党的第八十届议会来，却是并无逊色了。
    　　　　无恶不作
    八十一届议会最大的“成就”，是庞大的军事预算案的通过。杜鲁门上台后不几天，就向国会提出预算。一九四九会计年度的总支出，是四百二十二亿美元，军费占一百五十二亿。换句话说，每一块钱中，几乎有四角是用来预备打仗的。这个预算案，众院议员们不象对“公平之政”那样争争吵吵，而以空前的热忱又团结，迅速通过。仅有一张反对票，是国会里唯一一个进步派代表劳工党的麦堪东尼奥投的。不但如此，议员们还增拨了六亿美元，扩充空军。拨款委员会主席加农发表谈话说：“我们将猛炸战争的中心，然后让我们的盟友派出军队——派别人的子弟，不是我们的子弟。”议员们的战争热狂，对美国“盟友”的真面目，是活生生地表现在这几句话中了。
    第八十一届议会的第二桩“成就”，是“马歇尔计划“第二年拨款的通过。所谓“马歇尔计划”，表面说是以“欧洲经济复兴”为目标的。实际是美国在经济上奴役西欧诸国。西欧各国的经济情况，都由“马歇尔计划”造成的美货倾销，而日趋萧条。具体的表现，举其荦荦大者，是英国的美元危机，法国的经济困难；是意大利的三百万及西德的一百五十万失业人群；在六百万人口的小国比利时，竟也有三十万人在失业。
    第八十一届国会，好象很仁慈地通过了一个“对外援助法案”，拨款五十八亿另九百九十九万美元，包括“马计”第二年经费四十八亿五千余万元，其余则用作德日等地占领费及对希腊土耳其的援助。为什么民主党议会这末慷慨地拨款“援助”外国呢？原因是这笔款项，反正是美国人民用血汗缴纳的税款。把这钱给予外国时，附有条件，要他们把这款项拿到美国去买货。如此一来，大笔美国人民的钱便转入制造商及资本家们的荷包里了。而同时，这也帮助减轻他们生产过剩的问题。此外，这种“金元外交”的政策，可以把马歇尔化的国家变成美帝备战侵略的附庸。与“马歇尔计划”性质相同的，还有一个“技术援助落后地区计划”，已由国会原则上通过。这个计划，是要使美帝势力乘机侵入世界上一切未充分开发的殖民地及半殖民地。
    第八十一届议会的第三桩成就，是“北大西洋盟约”的批准。四月四日下午三时，十二个国家的外长在华盛顿签定了“北大西洋盟约”。美国的统治者们，美其名曰“防御性的公约”。事实上正如华莱士说的：“假想苏联在墨西哥边境有了军事基地，或者是在古巴，我们会如何想法？……说北大西洋协定是和平的工具是不折不扣的虚伪。”但是参议院在一番无关宏旨的辩论后，终将这“盟约”批准了。
    接着，杜鲁门把军事援助“北大西洋盟约”签字国的提议，送到国会。所谓“一九四九防务互助法案”，于九月二十八日经参众二院通过。拨款十三亿一千四百另一万元，除以十亿武装各“同盟国”外，其余分作国民党残余匪帮，及希、土、南韩、伊朗、菲律宾等反动政府之用。这样一来，政府当然需要大批订制军火，军火商们便可大发其财，而其他独占企业也可以部分改装为军火制造，企图暂时减轻生产过剩的问题。
    当“北大西洋盟约”签字的那天晚上，芝加哥一个无线电台广播一段访问。一个家庭主妇被问道那些国家是“北大西洋盟约”签字国，她说了一个美国，再也想不出第二个。访员说：“太太，我必须说你对时事相当隔膜”。她说：“我所关心的是牛奶已从二角涨到二角一分一夸特，房租又要加了。我对什么盟约不盟约，毫无兴趣。”这是善良美国人民的典型。他们已经又一次坠入了代表大资本家的杜鲁门政府，及民主党议会的大骗局。
    美国资产阶级的政客党棍，在竞选时大吹法螺，欺骗民众，骗得选票，一朝上台，就把竞选诺言，忘却干净，——这本是美国的所谓“民主”政治底特点。杜鲁门的骗局，就是一个明显的实例。
