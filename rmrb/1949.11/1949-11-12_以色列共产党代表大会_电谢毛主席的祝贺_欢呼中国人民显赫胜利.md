Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 11th: The Israeli Communist Party's 11th Congress, held on October 21st, had telegraphed an invitation to the Chinese Communist Party to send a representative to participate. Chairman Mao Zedong of the Chinese Communist Party replied to Israeli Communist Party leader Mikunis on October 11th, informing him that due to inconvenient transportation, a representative could not be sent, and congratulated the Israeli Communist Party's 11th Congress on its success. The Israeli Communist Party's 11th Congress replied to Chairman Mao's congratulations as follows:

To Mao Zedong, Chinese Communist Party, Beijing:

The 11th Congress of the Israeli Communist Party warmly accepts your fraternal congratulations and expresses our gratitude to you.

The masses of the Israeli people cheer the brilliant victory of the Chinese People's Army over the American and British dollar masters' agents in China – a turning point in the history of Asian countries and the world. Under your leadership, the Chinese people, by completely defeating the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and establishing a people's government, have dealt a heavy blow to the American and British warmongers' plan to turn China into one of the most decisive places for an anti-Soviet military base.

From your great struggle and their own experience, the people of Israel know that only by fighting relentlessly against imperialism alongside the world anti-imperialist peace camp led by the Soviet Union can national independence and peace be obtained and defended.

Long live our great fraternal Chinese Communist Party and its leader Mao Zedong!

Long live the bastion of peace and socialism, the Soviet Union!

Long live the unified socialist world front of the Communist Parties headed by Lenin and Stalin!

          The 11th Congress of the Israeli Communist Party

    以色列共产党代表大会
    电谢毛主席的祝贺
    欢呼中国人民显赫胜利
    【新华社北京十一日电】在上月二十一日举行的以色列共产党第十一届代表大会，曾电邀中国共产党派遣代表参加。中国共产党毛泽东主席在上月十一日电复以色列共产党领袖米库尼斯，告以因交通不便不能派代表参加，并祝贺以色列共产党第十一届代表大会的成功。以色列共产党第十一届代表大会对于毛主席的祝贺答复如下：
    北京中国共产党毛泽东：
    以色列共产党第十一届代表大会热烈地接受你的兄弟般的祝贺，并向你表示谢意。
    以色列的人民群众，欢呼中国人民的军队对美英美元主子在中国的代理人的显赫的胜利——这是亚洲国家及世界历史的转折点。中国人民在你的领导之下，由于完全击败了蒋介石匪帮并建立了人民的政府，从而使美英战争贩子将中国变为反苏军事基地这一计划中最具决定性的地方之一，受到了沉重的打击。
    以色列人民从你们巨大的斗争及他们自己的经验中，知道了只有与苏联领导下的世界反帝国主义和平阵营并肩对帝国主义进行无情的斗争，方能获得并保卫民族独立及和平。
    我们伟大的兄弟般的中国共产党及其领袖毛泽东万岁！
    和平及社会主义的堡垒苏联万岁！
    以列宁斯大林为首的共产党的社会主义世界统一阵线万岁！
          以色列共产党第十一届代表大会
