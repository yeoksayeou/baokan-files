Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 21st: Most areas of Northeast China have achieved a bumper rice harvest this year. The total rice paddy area in the region is 2,800,320 mu, with a total output of 470,300 tons, averaging over 362 jin per mu, more than double the average yield per mu of other crops (sorghum, corn, etc.). Songjiang Province, with the largest rice planting area, cultivated over 956,000 mu this year. Except for 210,000 mu which suffered reduced yields due to drought, the total output of the province reached over 133,900 tons, averaging 360 jin per mu. The suburban rice paddies of Shenyang, Benxi, Anshan, Fushun and other cities can yield an average of over 420 to 430 jin per mu. Nan Tingzi, a model worker in Ji'an County, Liaodong Province, achieved a yield of five shi, two dou, and eight sheng of grain per mu of rice paddy through deep plowing and careful cultivation, equivalent to 1,690 jin, exceeding the normal yield by 151 percent, setting the highest rice paddy yield record in Northeast China. The state-owned rice farms in various regions, due to the adoption of better varieties and improved farming methods, have yields two to three times higher than those of ordinary farmers. The Shuidao (rice paddy) Experimental Farm attached to the Chahayang Farm in Heilongjiang Province, the largest state-owned farm, changed the broadcasting method commonly used by ordinary farmers (spreading seeds across the field) this year and implemented the advanced row planting method (planting on ridges and furrows). As a result, the yield increased significantly. Taking the "Guangtou Rice" variety as an example, the yield per mu reached 1,300 jin, an increase of more than 400 jin per mu compared to the old broadcasting method. The "Hongguo Rice" variety planted by the Jiamusi Farm in Songjiang Province also yielded over 1,000 jin per mu, while the "Yuanzi No. 2" rice variety planted by the Longjing Farm in Jilin Province yielded over 1,600 jin per mu. Based on the experience of this year's bumper rice harvests in various regions, in addition to paying attention to expanding the planting area, Northeast China should also focus on promoting superior rice varieties and improving farming methods to generally increase rice paddy yields in all regions next year.

　　东北水稻丰收
　　总产量达四十七万余吨
　　最高产量每亩千六百九十斤
    【新华社沈阳二十一日电】东北今年大部地区水稻获得丰收。全境种水田面积共二百八十万零三千二百余亩，总产量达四十七万零三百余吨，平均每亩产量为三百六十二斤以上，超过其他作物（高粱、玉米等）每亩平均产量的一倍多。种稻面积最广的松江省，今年共种九十五万六千余亩，除二十一万亩因旱灾歉收外，全省总产量达十三万三千九百余吨，平均每亩产三百六十斤。沈阳、本溪、鞍山、抚顺等市郊水田，每亩平均能收四百二十斤至四百三十斤以上。辽东省辑安县一等劳动模范南廷兹由于深耕细作，使每亩稻田打粮五石二斗八升，合一千六百九十斤，超过常年产量的百分之一百五十一，创造了东北水田产量的最高纪录。各地的公营水田农场，由于采用较好品种，并改进了耕作方法，其收成则较一般农民超过两、三倍。规模最大的黑龙江省营查哈阳农场附设水田试验场，今年改变一般农民所习用的散播办法（成片播），实行进步的条播（打成畦垄再种）后，产量大大增加，仅以“光头稻”品种为例，每亩产量即达一千三百斤，较旧法播种，每亩增产四百余斤。松江省佳木斯农场所种的“红锅稻”品种，每亩亦产一千斤以上，吉林省龙井农场所种的“原子”二号稻种，每亩则产一千六百多斤。根据各地今年水田丰收的经验，东北明年水田的增产，除注意扩大播种面积外，并应注意推广优良稻种和改善耕作方法，使各地水田产量普遍提高。
