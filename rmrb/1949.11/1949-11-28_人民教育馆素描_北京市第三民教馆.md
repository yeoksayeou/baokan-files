　　People's Education Center Sketch
    ——Beijing No. 3 People's Education Center
    Peng Fang
    Braving the chilling wind and stepping on a thin, slippery layer of silvery frost, I followed the footsteps of the masses and walked into the people's classroom - Beijing No. 3 People's Education Center.
    Six large portraits of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, Mao, and Zhu hung high in the center of the room. And their diligent apprentices: some in long gowns and short jackets, some in greasy work clothes, some in student uniforms, some in plain cheongsams… men and women, old and young, from all walks of life.
    That one wearing old-fashioned glasses, with a flowing silver beard; that one with a bright red face, that one with thin cheeks and a bald head, that one with long braids… all kinds of faces concentratedly surrounding the wide desk.
    So many faces, yet not a sound could be heard. They are enthusiastically immersed in the sunshine of the New Democratic culture, clearing away the remnants of the old society left in their minds.
    Breathing in the light and heat of the new culture, everyone forgot the winter cold and felt the warmth of spring. The five-star red flags above their heads fluttered like two teams of butterflies, and pictures of combat and construction, brightly colored, hung all over the room. Everyone felt a strong sense of a large, democratic family life, a united and lively fresh atmosphere, as cheerful as celebrating New Year's Day.
    The electric lights were turned on, but many minds were still immersed in the pages, pursuing the ideal new realm.
    That female worker comrade, inspired by the mass's enthusiasm for learning, had not yet eaten. She hurriedly toasted two steamed buns and ate them, then sat back at her desk and busily went back to work.
    Outside the glass window, the dark night had already spread out. With the sound of the bell announcing "end of reading," I walked out of this school for the masses, filled with joy as if coming out of a club.

　　人民教育馆素描
    ——北京市第三民教馆
    篷放
    冒着冷飕飕的风，踏着一层薄溜溜的银白色的霜花，随着群众的脚步，走进了人民的课堂，——北京市第三民教馆。
    马、恩、列、斯、毛、朱，六大幅巨像，高悬在房壁中央。而他们底勤劳的学徒：有穿长挂短袄的，油污的工作衣的，学生制服的，朴素的旗袍的……来自各阶层的男女老少。
    那戴老花眼镜，银髯飘飘；那脸蛋红亮，那瘦颊秃脑，那双辫长垂……，各种脸孔聚精会神地围着宽大的书案。
    好多的人脸呀，却听不出一点声音。他们热心倾注在新民主文化的阳光里，清除旧社会留给脑海里的残渣。
    呼吸着新文化的光和热，大家忘掉冬寒，感到春天似的温暖。头上的五星小红旗，象两队蝴蝶翩翩飞哩，战斗和建设的画片，色彩鲜明的挂满房间。大家感到一股强烈的大民主的家庭生活里，团结活泼的新鲜空气，象过元旦节一样的欢快。
    电灯光扭亮了，而那许多头脑却依然沈浸在书页里，追求在理想的新境界。
    那位女工作员同志，被这群众的学习热潮鼓舞着，她还未吃饭哩，匆匆地烤两个烧馒头吃着，又坐到办公桌后忙碌地工作起来。
    玻璃窗外已扯开黑沈沈的夜幕。随着“停止阅览”的铃声走出了这群众的学校，象从俱乐部出来那样充满愉快。
    一九四九，一一，二四。
    于北京第三民教馆写成
