Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 17th: Polish News Agency, Paris: On November 11th, Armistice Day of World War I, French ex-servicemen and disabled veterans held an anti-war demonstration. French ex-servicemen and members of the Resistance marched towards the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. The War Widows Association, the French League, the Republican Association of Former Soldiers, former political prisoners from German concentration camps (wearing the striped uniforms they used to wear in the concentration camps), and former prisoners of war and guerrillas followed closely behind the disabled veterans of the two World Wars. Among the demonstrators were also many Poles and other foreigners who had participated in the French Resistance. The reactionary French authorities had already concentrated a large number of police on the avenue leading to the cemetery in an attempt to suppress the demonstration, but when the demonstration procession passed by, the police were still unable to stop the crowd's shouts: "We want peace!" "Down with the Vietnam War!" At the same time, students who were forbidden from participating in the demonstration were promoting opposition to the Pidault government's war policy in various traffic arteries in Paris.

According to a report from the Electric Communication Agency, Paris, November 15th: A group of French officers and soldiers who recently returned from Vietnam also demanded an end to the French reactionary government's colonial war of massacring the Vietnamese people. They wrote to veterans of the Vietnam War, and the families of those soldiers who died or were still left there by the reactionary French government, announcing their decision to organize a strong democratic group of Vietnam War veterans and their families to fight for peace and oppose the massacre of the Vietnamese people.

  　法人民反战示威
    越南战争退伍军人筹组反战团体
    【新华社北京十七日电】波兰通讯社巴黎讯：法国前战士与残废军人于十一月十一日第一次世界大战休战日，举行反战示威游行。法国前战士及抵抗运动者列队走向无名战士公墓。战争孀妇协会、法国联盟、前战士共和协会、前德国集中营里的政治犯（他们穿上了从前在集中营中所穿的有条纹的制服）以及前战俘和游击队队员，都紧跟在两次世界大战中的残废军人后面，参加示威的人群中，还有许多曾经参加法国抵抗运动的波兰人和其他外国人。法反动当局早已在走向公墓的大道上集中大批警察，力图镇压，但当示威行列经过时，警察仍无法制止群众的呼声：“我们要和平！”“打倒越南战争！”同时，被禁止不能参加示威的学生们，则在巴黎各交通要道宣传反对皮杜尔政府的战争政策。
    另据电通社巴黎十五日讯：最近自越南归国的一群法国军官和士兵，也要求停止法国反动政府屠杀越南人民的殖民地战争。他们致书越南战争的退伍军人，和那些战死或仍被法国反动政府留在那里的士兵的家属，宣布决定组织一个越南战争退伍军人和他们的家属的强大民主团体，争取和平，反对屠杀越南人民。
