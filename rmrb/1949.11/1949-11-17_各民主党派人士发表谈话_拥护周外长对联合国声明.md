Democratic Parties Issue Statements
　　Supporting Foreign Minister Zhou's Statement to the United Nations

　　[This newspaper dispatch] After the publication of Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's telegram to the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the President of the United Nations General Assembly stating that the Kuomintang reactionary remnant government has no right to represent China and requesting the cancellation of the legal status of the Chiang Ting-fu delegation, the people of the whole country unanimously supported it. Various democratic parties and non-party democratic figures issued written statements as follows:

　　　　China Democratic League

　　The spokesperson of the headquarters of the China Democratic League issued a statement saying: ——The reactionary government of the Chinese Kuomintang has always stood in opposition to the people, so its envoys sent abroad have never spoken for the interests of the Chinese people. Therefore, as early as a year ago, on October 22, 1948, this league had already jointly declared to the United Nations with other democratic parties, announcing the crimes of the reactionary Nanjing government, and did not recognize the pseudo-Nanjing government's qualifications to represent the Chinese people in attending the United Nations. Now that the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China has been established, and this reactionary remnant government has been basically destroyed, of course, the so-called "Chinese Kuomintang Government Delegation" it previously sent to the United Nations has lost the qualification to represent the Chinese people. This statement by Zhou, also serving as Foreign Minister, to the United Nations is a well-deserved move, and we fully support it. At the same time, this is also a test for the United Nations. If the United Nations respects the will of the Chinese people, it should immediately agree to the request of our Zhou, also serving as Foreign Minister, and cancel all rights of the so-called "Chinese Kuomintang Government Delegation" headed by Chiang Ting-fu to continue to represent the Chinese people in participating in the United Nations.

　　　　China National Democratic Construction Association

　　The spokesperson of the China National Democratic Construction Association expressed the following opinions: ——The Kuomintang reactionary regime has long been spurned by the entire Chinese people and has become a public enemy of the people. From a moral standpoint, it has long been unable to represent China. Due to the great victory of the Chinese People's Revolution, it has now been abandoned by its followers and disintegrated, leaving only pitiful remnant forces, fleeing eastward and westward, becoming bandits. Therefore, from a substantial basis, it is no longer a government. It has more than 20 years of ruling China, possessing an unprecedentedly large armed organization in Chinese history, plus the unprecedented huge aid from US imperialism, and finally suffered a crushing defeat in just over three years. Isn't this enough to prove that it has no support from the people? Even the representatives of US imperialism say that it has lost all popular support, isn't this enough to prove that it is no longer qualified to represent China?

　　The United Nations actually still accommodates the delegation of such a group of ugly national traitors, which the Chinese people will never recognize, and we feel that this is a disgrace to the United Nations. US imperialism still supports this group of clowns who have long been considered to have lost all popular support, insulting the Chinese people's revolution and our friendly country, the Soviet Union, at the United Nations conference hall; this is especially infuriating to us! This fully demonstrates the decline and degeneration of old democracy.

　　We fully agree with Foreign Minister Zhou's statement and demand that the United Nations drive out Chiang Ting-fu's clown group. It is no longer qualified to represent any country. The only one that can represent China is the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China.

　　　　China Association for Promoting Democracy

　　The China Association for Promoting Democracy issued the following statement: The reactionary regime of Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang, under the powerful force of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, declared its collapse as early as April this year when Nanjing was liberated. A small group of Kuomintang rogue bandits fled to Guangzhou and temporarily hung up a broken sign, but it was crushed again due to the liberation of Guangzhou. Therefore, even the Kuomintang reactionary remnant government has basically perished, and the remaining remnants of remnants will soon be completely eliminated. This is commonly seen and believed by the people of the world; therefore, today, the only one that can represent the Chinese people is the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, that is, the people's own government. This is beyond doubt and is commonly seen and believed by the people of the world.

　　The so-called "Chinese Kuomintang Government Delegation" currently participating in the United Nations organization and attending this session of the United Nations General Assembly in the name of representing the Chinese people has absolutely no qualification to represent the Chinese people. The first plenary session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference resolved: The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China is the only government that can represent the Chinese people, and the government should issue a statement denying the qualifications of all representatives sent by the pseudo-Kuomintang government to attend the United Nations meetings. On November 15, Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China officially requested the United Nations in a statement to immediately cancel all rights of the "Chinese Kuomintang Government Delegation" to continue to represent the Chinese people in participating in the United Nations. This is to represent the Central People's Government in implementing the resolutions of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, fully in line with the interests of the Chinese people, and we fully support Foreign Minister Zhou's statement.

　　　　Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party

　　Peng Zemin of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party issued a written statement saying: ——The Kuomintang reactionary remnant government actually sent a so-called "delegation" to attend the United Nations General Assembly, which is extremely shameless!

　　The Kuomintang reactionary government ceased to exist as early as after the liberation of Nanjing. Later, it fled to Guangdong, and when Guangdong was liberated, it fled to Sichuan, just a small group of fleeing bandits! Bandits naturally have no qualification to send a so-called "delegation." Therefore, the delegation currently attending the United Nations General Assembly calling itself the "Chinese Kuomintang Government"—Chiang Ting-fu and a group of shameless people—should naturally immediately have all their legal status and rights cancelled. A group of bandits' representatives has absolutely no right to speak for the Chinese people in the United Nations General Assembly organization.

　　Why was the Kuomintang reactionary government quickly eliminated under the massive military assistance of US imperialism? Obviously, this is because the Chinese people saw through this reactionary tool of exploitation and rose up and kicked it away. After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Chinese people were determined to overthrow the Kuomintang reactionary government from the beginning of the civil war. In fact, this puppet government had no right to represent the Chinese people long before this session of the United Nations General Assembly.

　　Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people have established their own government. On October 1 this year, the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China officially announced its establishment. This Central People's Government, headed by Chairman Mao Zedong, is China's only legitimate government and the Chinese people's own government. Only this government is qualified to send representatives to attend the United Nations General Assembly.

　　If there are still people who recognize that Chiang Ting-fu and this group of shameless desperadoes have legal qualifications in the United Nations General Assembly, that is an insult to the Chinese people, and it is openly being hostile to the Chinese people. The Chinese people cannot tolerate it and must resolutely oppose it.

　　　　New Democratic Youth League

　　Feng Wenbin, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, told this reporter: "The Chinese New Democratic Youth League expresses its full support for the statement made by Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai of the Central People's Government to the United Nations. We believe that the so-called 'Chinese Kuomintang Government Delegation' headed by Chiang Ting-fu has absolutely no qualification to represent the Chinese people. Since the liberation of Nanjing in April this year and the liberation of Guangzhou in October, the so-called 'Chinese Kuomintang Government' has long disintegrated, leaving only a small number of remnants fleeing east and west in islands and mountains. The representatives of this small group of remnants, such as Chiang Ting-fu, are just political swindlers. They no longer have any connection with the Chinese people. What qualifications do they have to pose as Chinese representatives in the United Nations? Therefore, we hope that the United Nations organization can respect the will of the Chinese people and immediately accept the request put forward by Foreign Minister Zhou of the Chinese Central People's Government, and announce the cancellation of the rights of the delegation sent by the Kuomintang reactionary remnant government to participate in the United Nations.

　　　　Guo Moruo

　　Guo Moruo issued the following written statement: ——The Kuomintang reactionary government has long been unqualified to represent the Chinese people, and it didn't start today. As of today, the remnants of that reactionary government have become fish in a cauldron. The entire Chinese people are preparing to arrest them and try them as war criminals. They have even less qualification to represent the Chinese people. Minister Zhou's telegram to the United Nations denying the puppet government's right of representation represents the will of the entire Chinese people, and the entire Chinese people warmly support it. If the United Nations General Assembly can truly represent international justice and respect the authority of the United Nations General Assembly itself, it should have automatically revoked the legal status of the puppet government's representatives long ago. Today is not too late. I hope that after receiving Minister Zhou's telegram, they will immediately be alerted and take swift action to comply with the wishes of the Chinese people. If not, they will commit a major error, become a tool of imperialism, and completely destroy the authority of the United Nations General Assembly.

　　　　Mao Dun

　　Mao Dun issued the following written statement: ——Foreign Minister Zhou's solemn statement will not only be warmly supported by the entire Chinese people, but also by the peace-loving and democratic countries and people all over the world. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang has long been unqualified to represent the Chinese people, and now even their so-called "legitimate" government that steals their name has basically been eliminated. The Chinese people have elected the Central People's Government according to their own wishes, and many advanced countries have established diplomatic relations with us. Under such circumstances, people like Chiang Ting-fu continue to swindle and deceive in the United Nations, and the United Nations also allows them to pose as representatives of the Chinese people, which is not only an insult to the Chinese people, but also contrary to the purpose of the United Nations organization. The Chinese people resolutely demand the immediate cancellation of all rights of the so-called "representatives" of the Kuomintang reactionary remnant government in the United Nations.

　　各民主党派人士发表谈话
  　拥护周外长对联合国声明
    【本报讯】外交部周恩来部长致联合国组织秘书长及联合国大会主席声明国民党反动残余政府无权代表中国，要求取消蒋廷黻代表团的合法地位的电文发表后，全国人民一致拥护，各民主党派与无党派民主人士发表书面谈话如下：
    　　　　中国民主同盟
    中国民主同盟总部发言人发表谈话称：——中国国民党反动政府一向就是站在和人民对立的地位，因此他派遣到国外的使节亦从来没有代表中国人民的利益说话。所以，远在一年以前，一九四八年十月二十二日，本盟已经联合其他民主党派向联合国声明，宣布当时南京反动政府的罪状，不承认伪南京政府有代表中国人民出席联合国的资格。现在，中华人民共和国中央人民政府已经成立，这个反动残余政府业已基本灭亡，当然他以前派到联合国组织的所谓“中国国民政府代表团”更已失去代表中国人民的资格。这次周兼外长向联合国的声明，乃是名正言顺之举，我们完全拥护。同时这也是对联合国的一种考验，如果联合国尊重中国人民的意志，他就应该立即同意我们周兼外长的要求，取消以蒋廷黻为首的所谓“中国国民政府代表团”继续代表中国人民参加联合国的一切权利。
    　　　　民主建国会
    民主建国会发言人表示如下的意见：——国民党反动政权早已为全中国人民所唾弃，变成了人民的公敌。从道德的条件来说，它早已不能代表中国。由于中国人民革命的伟大胜利，它现在已经众叛亲离、土崩瓦解，只余可怜的残余力量，东逃西窜，成为流寇。因此，从实质的基础来说，它也已经不成其为一个政府。它有二十多年统治中国的历史，拥有中国历史上空前庞大的武装组织，再加上美帝的空前巨大的援助而终于在短短的三年多的时间之内，一败涂地。这还不够证明它已经没有人民的支持吗？连美帝的代表人物都说它失尽人心，还不够证明它已经没有代表中国的资格吗？
    这样一伙丑恶的国贼，联合国居然还要容纳它的代表团，我们中国人民万难承认，而且觉得这是联合国的耻辱。美帝居然还要支持这一群早已认为失尽人心的小丑，在联合国会场上侮蔑我们中国人民革命和我们的友邦苏联；尤其使我们愤慨！这充分表现了旧民主主义的没落和堕落。
    我们完全同意周外长的声明，要求联合国把蒋廷黻的小丑集团骗逐出去。它已经没有资格代表任何的国家，唯一能够代表中国的，是中华人民共和国的中央人民政府。
    　　　　中国民主促进会
    中国民主促进会发表声明如下：蒋介石国民党的反动政权，在中国人民解放军的强大威力之下，早在今年四月解放南京时就宣告崩溃了，残余的一小撮国民党流氓土匪，逃到广州临时挂起一块破碎的招牌，但又由于广州的解放而被粉碎，因此现在连国民党反动残余政府也已基本上灭亡，所剩下的残余的残余，不久也可全部被消灭，这是全世界人民所共见共信的；因此，今天唯一能够代表中国人民的是中华人民共和国中央人民政府，即人民自己的政府，这是毫无疑义的，也是全世界人民所共见共信的。
    目前以代表中国人民名义，参加联合国组织，并出席本届联合国大会的所谓“中国国民政府代表团”，绝对没有代表中国人民的任何资格。中国人民政协第一届全体决议：中华人民共和国中央人民政府为唯一能代表中国人民的政府，应由政府发出声明，否认伪国民党政府所派出席联合国会议所有代表的代表资格。十一月十五日中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部周恩来部长向联合国声明正式要求立即取消“中国国民政府代表团”继续代表中国人民参加联合国的一切权利，这即是代表中央人民政府执行中国人民政协的决议，完全符合中国人民的利益的，我们完全拥护周外长的声明。
    　　　　中国农工民主党
    中国农工民主党彭泽民发表书面谈话称：——国民党反动残余政府，居然派遣所谓“代表团”出席联合国大会，真是无耻之极！
    国民党反动派政府，早在南京解放后就不存在了，以后流亡到广东，广东解放了，又流亡到四川，只是一小群逃窜的流寇！流寇自然无派遣所谓“代表团”的资格，因此，目前出席联大的自称为“中国国民政府”的代表团——蒋廷黻一群无耻之徒，自然应立即取消其一切合法的地位和权利，一群流寇的代表是绝对无权代表中国人民在联合国大会组织中发言。
    国民党反动派政府，在美帝国主义大量的军事援助下，为什么很快就被消灭？很显然的，这就是中国人民看清了这个反动的剥削的工具，而起来，一脚把它踢掉，在抗战胜利后自内战开始中国人民就决心推翻国民党反动派政府，其实这个伪政府早在这次联合国大会之前，就无权代表中国人民的。
    中国人民在中国共产党的领导下，已经建立起自己的政府了，本年十月一日中华人民共和国中央人民政府正式宣布成立，这个以毛泽东主席为首的中央人民政府，是中国惟一的合法政府，是中国人民自己的政府，只有这个政府才有资格派遣代表出席联合国大会的。
    如果现在还有人承认蒋廷黻这一群无耻亡命之徒在联大中有合法资格，那就是对中国人民的侮辱，就是公然与中国人民为敌，中国人民是不能忍受的，必须坚决反对的。
    　　　　新民主主义青年团
    中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会书记冯文彬向本报记者发表谈话说：“中国新民主主义青年团对于中央人民政府周恩来外长向联合国的声明，表示完全拥护。我们认为，以蒋廷黻为首的所谓‘中国国民政府代表团’，根本就没有代表中国人民的资格。自从今年四月南京解放，十月广州解放后，所谓‘中国国民政府’早已土崩瓦解，只剩下少数残余分子，在海岛与丛山中东逃西窜。这一小群残余分子的代表蒋廷黻等只是些政治骗子，他们和中国人民已没有任何联系，还有什么资格在联合国中冒充中国代表？因此，我们希望联合国组织能够尊重中国人民的意志，立即接受中国中央人民政府周外长所提出的要求，宣布取消国民党反动残余政府所派遣的代表团参加联合国的权利。
    　　　　郭沫若
    郭沫若发表书面谈话如下：——国民党反动政府早就没有代表中国人民的资格，并不是从今天开始。到了今天那个反动政府的残余已经成为釜底游魂，全中国人民正准备把它们捉来作为战犯审判，更没有一丝一厘代表中国人民的资格。周部长致电联合国否认伪政府的代表权，那正代表了全中国人民的意志，全中国人民都是热烈拥护的。联合国大会如果真能代表团际正义并尊重联合国大会本身的权威，早就应该自动地撤消伪政府代表的合法地位。今天还不迟，我盼望他们接到周部长的电报便立即警悟，迅速采取行动以符合中国人民的愿望。如若不然，他们便会犯下重大错误，成为帝国主义的御用机构，使联合国大会的权威扫地殆尽。
    　　　　茅盾
    茅盾发表书面谈话如下：——周外长的严正声明，不但为全中国人民所热烈地拥护，也将为全世界爱好和平民主的国家与人民所热烈地拥护与支持的。蒋介石匪帮早就没有资格代表中国人民，现在则连他们的盗窃名义的所谓“合法”政府也已基本上归于消灭了，中国人民已经按照自己的愿望选举了中央人民政府，许多先进国家已与我建立外交关系；在这样的形势之下，蒋廷黻之类还继续在联合国招摇撞骗，而联合国也还容许他们冒充中国人民的代表，那就不但侮辱了中国人民，也和联合国组织的宗旨相背谬的。中国人民坚决要求立即取消国民党反动残余政府在联合国的所谓“代表”的一切权利。
