　　Henan Provincial Government Cares for the People's Livelihood in Disaster Areas
  　Reducing and Exempting 9.2 Million Jin of Public Grain
    Allocating 1.8 Million Jin of Relief Grain to Aid Severely Affected Households, and Increasing Loans of 1.5 Million Jin of Wheat Seeds to Support Farmers in Planting Wheat
    [Special Dispatch] The Henan Provincial Government, in consideration of the people's livelihood in disaster areas, has decided to reduce and exempt the autumn public grain burden. Since the beginning of autumn, there have been more than 20 consecutive days of continuous rain, resulting in a generally poor late autumn harvest. In addition, due to the long-term devastation by the Kuomintang bandit troops and the disrepair of river courses, the water levels of the Yellow River, Luo River, Ru River, and Hong River have risen, causing breaches in the riverbanks or preventing the water from receding. According to incomplete statistics, 211,000 mu of land in the Xuchang Special District were flooded, 112,990 mu of land in the Luoyang Special District were completely submerged, 584,375 mu in the Shangqiu severely affected area, and 933,796 mu of land in the Xinyang Special District were affected. In order to take care of the people's livelihood and their ability to bear the burden, the Provincial Government has issued an order to reduce and exempt 9.2 million jin of public grain, allocate 1.8 million jin of relief grain, and increase loans of 1.5 million jin of wheat seeds. These will be distributed by the special districts according to the severity of the disaster to provide appropriate reductions and exemptions. Appropriate relief will be provided to households severely affected by the disaster, and loans of wheat seeds will be given to those who have difficulty planting wheat to support them in planting.
