Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 8th:

    The Chinese Labor Association Representative Conference held its second meeting today. At the meeting, Liu Ningyi, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU), spoke first. He began by saying: The interests of workers across China are consistent. Reactionaries are trying to split the solidarity of the nation’s workers. The cooperation between the Chinese Labor Association and us has endured a long period of shared hardship, forged under the enemy's bayonets and in prisons. He said: The progressive forces of the Labor Association and members of the Labor Association in many places have long worked alongside the trade unions in the liberated areas and the underground trade unions in various regions led by the Chinese Communist Party. Our cooperation in thought and organization has been long-standing. Without such long-term cooperation for a common cause, it would not be possible to unify in a common force today. Liu Ningyi concluded by saying: Due to the different environments in which the two organizations were previously situated, some issues may arise when members of the original Labor Association join the All-China Federation of Trade Unions after the Labor Association is dissolved. However, as long as we are sincere, treat each other as family, maintain our respective excellent styles from the past, learn from each other, and help each other, we will surely unite well and advance our great revolutionary cause. Following this, Yi Lirong, Secretary-General of the Chinese Labor Association, delivered a work report on the Chinese Labor Association. The meeting also passed resolutions establishing the Organizational Declaration Drafting Committee, the Labor Association Work Report Summary Committee, the Association Property and Archives Inventory Committee, the Association Affairs Aftermath Handling Committee, and the Proposal Review Committee.

　　劳协代表会议举行二次会议
  　全总副主席刘宁一讲话
    劳协书记长易礼容作工作报告
    【新华社北京八日电】中国劳动协会代表会议今日举行第二次会议。会上首由中华全国总工会副主席刘宁一讲话。他首先说：全中国的工人的利益是一致的。反动派力图分裂全国工人的团结。中国劳动协会和我们的合作是经过了长时期的同甘共苦，是在敌人的刺刀下和监狱中锻炼出来的。他说：劳动协会的进步力量和许多地方的劳动协会会员曾经长期与解放区工会及中国共产党领导的各地地下工会在一起工作。我们在思想上与组织上的合作已经很久。如果没有为着共同事业的这样长期的合作，那末今天就不可能统一在共同的队伍中。刘宁一最后说：由于两个组织过去所处的环境不同，因此在劳动协会解散后原劳动协会会员参加到中华全国总工会时，可能发生一些问题，但是，只要我们真心诚意，彼此看作一家人，保持过去各有的优良作风，互相学习，互相帮助，那末我们一定能团结得好，把我们的伟大的革命事业推向前进。接着，中国劳动协会书记长易礼容作中国劳动协会工作报告。会议并通过组织宣言电文起草委员会、劳动协会工作报告总结委员会、会产档案清理委员会、会务善后处理委员会以及提案审查委员会。
