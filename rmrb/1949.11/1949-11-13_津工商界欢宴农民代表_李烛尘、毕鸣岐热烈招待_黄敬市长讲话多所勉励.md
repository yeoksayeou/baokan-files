Tianjin Electric News from this Newspaper: The Tianjin industrial and commercial associations jointly hosted a banquet at 5 PM yesterday (the 12th) to entertain farmer representatives. At the banquet, Li Zhuchen and Bi Mingqi, heads of the industrial and commercial associations, extended a warm welcome to all the farmer representatives on behalf of the industrial and commercial circles. They unanimously expressed their hope that all the representatives would offer many suggestions in the spirit of developing industrial production and prospering the economy, so as to achieve smooth exchanges of goods between urban and rural areas. Mayor Huang Jing also attended the meeting and delivered a speech. He first welcomed the arrival of the farmer representatives on behalf of the people of the city. He said: It was not easy for the farmers to come to the city this time. This was earned by the farmers through bloodshed, sweat, money and effort under the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. He earnestly encouraged the farmer representatives to build industrial cities in this spirit of hard work, so that industry can serve agriculture and achieve mutual assistance between urban and rural areas. Farmer representative Shi Jiancheng also spoke with confidence, guaranteeing that the representatives would return to their villages to promote the planting of more industrial raw materials in order to supply the needs of urban industry. Dinner began at 6 PM, followed by group discussions to broadly exchange information on urban and rural goods.

[Another dispatch] Farmer representatives from Shanxi and Pingyuan provinces who came to Tianjin for a visit continued to visit the Industrial Exhibition at 8 AM yesterday (the 12th). During the visit, everyone unanimously paid close attention to the export goods and the large number of agricultural implements in the iron and steel machinery hall. Every representative lingered and was reluctant to leave when visiting the two halls. Some representatives meticulously recorded the names of the goods in their notebooks. The visit ended at 1 PM. The city's sports conference invited representatives to visit the grand occasion of the conference.
