    Integrating Land Reform Work
    Winter Schools Launched in the Suburbs of Beijing
    Municipal Education Bureau Convenes Meeting of Cultural and Educational Section Chiefs from Suburban Districts
    [Beijing News] In order to actively promote the winter school movement in the suburbs of Beijing and to deploy this work, the Municipal Education Bureau convened a joint meeting of cultural and educational section chiefs from the suburban districts on the 9th of this month. In addition to the cultural and educational section chiefs from the suburban districts, representatives from the Suburban Work Committee and the Propaganda Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China also attended. After each district reported on their work, Li Yifan, the head of the Social Education Section of the Education Bureau, proposed five principles for carrying out winter schools in the suburbs: 1. Winter schools should be closely integrated with land reform work; 2. Winter schools should be under the unified leadership of the Suburban Work Committee; 3. The content of winter schools should mainly consist of political and policy education related to land reform, and cultural classes should be organized separately; 4. Winter schools should be carried out with a focus, following the progress of land reform; 5. The target audience of winter schools should be workers and their families, general farmers, independent laborers, and small merchants, etc. At the meeting, these principles, as well as specific issues such as teachers, teaching materials, winter school operating expenses (mainly lamp oil and coal), and student textbook subsidies, were discussed. Except for operating expenses, which need to be requested from higher authorities for approval, other issues were resolved. Finally, Li Yifan emphasized that in order to carry out winter schools, it is necessary to conduct investigation and research, grasp the characteristics of the suburbs, proceed steadily from the interests of the masses, and resolutely oppose the bad practices of formalism and coercion.

    市教局召开郊区文教科长会议
    【北京讯】为了积极开展本市郊区冬学运动，并布置此项工作，市教育局于本月九日召开了郊区文教科长联席会，到会的除郊区文教科长外，郊区工作委员会及中共市委宣传部亦派有代表参加。在各区报告了工作情况后，由教育局社教科科长李一帆提出开展效区冬学的五点原则意见：一、冬学应密切结合土改工作；二、冬学由郊委会一元化领导；三、冬学内容：主要是进行有关土改的政治、政策教育，文化课应另行组织进行；四、冬学应跟随土改有重点的开展；五、冬学对象，应该是工人及其家属、一般农民、独立劳动者、以及小商人等。在会上对此项原则以及教员、教材及冬学办公费（主要是灯油煤火）、学生课本补助等具体问题进行了讨论，除办公费须向上级请示批发外，其他问题都得到了解决。最后李一帆又强调提出：开展冬学必须进行调查研究，掌握郊区特点，多多从群众利益出发，稳步前进，坚决反对形式主义与强迫命令的恶劣作风。
