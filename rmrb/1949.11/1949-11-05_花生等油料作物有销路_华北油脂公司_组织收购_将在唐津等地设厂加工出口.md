Peanut and Other Oil Crop Sales Channels Open
  North China Oil Company
  Organizes Purchases
    Will Establish Factories in Tangshan, Tianjin and Other Places for Processing and Export
    [From Our Newspaper] With the autumn harvest approaching, peanut and other oil crops planted in various parts of North China are successively entering the market. In addition to purchasing cotton and ginning cotton through local cotton, yarn and cloth companies, and purchasing cotton seeds, the North China Oil Company also directly or through cooperatives purchases oil crops such as peanuts, flax seeds, and mustard seeds in various producing areas. Currently, the company is allocating funds to its branches and is preparing to combine purchases with supplying farmers with kerosene, grain, cloth and other goods to meet farmers' needs and reduce currency issuance.
    The company plans to establish export peanut processing factories in Tangshan, Qinhuangdao and Tianjin, and organize a part of private enterprises to process peanuts produced in the Jidong area nearby, in order to ship them to the United States, Canada and Europe.

    【本报讯】秋收已届，华北各地种植的花生等油料作物相继登场，华北油脂公司除了通过各地花纱布公司收花轧花及收购棉籽外，并在各产地直接或通过合作社收购花生、胡麻籽、芥菜籽等油料；现该公司正向各分支机构调拨资金，并准备结合收购供给农民以煤油、粮食、布匹等物以解决农民需要，减少货币投放。
    该公司计划在唐山、秦皇岛和天津等地设立出口花生加工工厂，并组织一部分私营力量，就近整理冀东一带所产花生，以运往美国、加拿大和欧洲等地。
