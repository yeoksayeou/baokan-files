Experiences in Aphid Control in the Suburbs of Shijiazhuang
(North China Farm, Yang Qingzheng, Zhang Yongfu, Sun Wenke)

Aphids are the cotton plant's greatest enemy. Every year in various places, cotton production is reduced due to this disaster. This year, the occurrence of cotton aphids in the suburbs of Shijiazhuang was more widespread and serious than in previous years. To prevent a reduction in cotton production, we immediately mobilized twenty technical cadres and sixty trainees to go deep into the villages and launch a broad aphid control campaign at the beginning of the outbreak. After more than two months (from May 26th to August 6th) of hard work and struggle, the aphids were basically eliminated, ensuring the cotton harvest in the sixty villages in the suburbs of Shijiazhuang, and achieving good experience, laying a solid foundation for future aphid control. Now we will systematically introduce the experience gained in this aphid control campaign:

I. New Laws of Aphid Occurrence

The occurrence of aphids has certain objective conditions, such as the season, weather, the dryness and humidity of the air, and whether the branches and leaves are luxuriant, all of which are related. It is generally believed that the occurrence of cotton aphids is favored by hot and dry weather. However, the two occurrences of aphids in the suburbs of Shijiazhuang this year have two characteristics that differ from the past: First, the occurrence was earlier. The initial occurrence was in early June, when the cotton seedlings were only five or six inches tall; second, the occurrence was in wet and hot conditions. The second occurrence was in early July, during which time there were continuous rains and humid and hot weather, and the occurrence and spread of aphids were very severe. This shows that the occurrence of aphids is not only suitable for drought but also for humid and hot weather. We should be familiar with and pay close attention to these laws, which are very important for preventing the occurrence of aphids and stopping their spread.

II. Three Major Achievements

In this two-month aphid control work, we believe that the significant and valuable gains are these three points:

(1) Ensuring that cotton aphids in the suburbs of Shijiazhuang did not become a disaster: After the occurrence of cotton aphids in the suburbs of Shijiazhuang, we made this determination and arranged our work network in a timely, universal, and meticulous manner. Within two months, we prevented and controlled more than 8,500 mu of cotton aphids, accounting for more than 48% of the total cotton planting area, realizing our determination and plan. If cotton aphids in Shijiazhuang had not been prevented and controlled in time this year, the yield per mu was estimated to be reduced by 30 jin. More than 8,500 mu would have produced 250,000 jin less. Every jin of seed cotton is calculated as four jin of millet, worth more than one million jin of millet in total. What an astonishing number! Secondly, we have another significant achievement, that is, the general farmers know that foreign cotton has a large yield and good quality, and are very willing to plant it. However, "nine years out of ten have aphids," which often hit their confidence in planting foreign cotton. This year, we eliminated the aphids, ensuring that the cotton would not suffer disaster, thus enabling farmers to establish the confidence to dare to grow foreign cotton without fear of aphid damage, laying the foundation for next year's promotion work.

(2) Handing over the technology to the masses: It is impossible to universally complete the aphid control work over a large area with our own strength alone. Therefore, we emphasize handing over the technology to the masses, which not only allows farmers to recognize the efficacy of the technology but also lays the foundation for future work. This year, in the five, six, seven, and eight districts, and sixty villages of Shijiazhuang, we passed on the aphid control technology to 270 experienced farmers and village cadres. An average of more than four people in each village mastered the skilled aphid control technology, laying the bridge and foundation for next year's aphid control work.

(3) Training cadres from work: During this period of work, the comrades enriched themselves and tempered themselves. Not only did they strengthen the concept of serving the people ideologically, but also gained relatively rich experience technically. Among all the working comrades (including 20 cadres and 60 trainees), at least 90% of the people were able to master the skilled and correct aphid control technology. In next year's aphid control work, each comrade will have the ability to handle a task independently.

III. Experiences Gained from Work

The experiences gained from work, whether successful or failed, are worthy of attention. Because accepting these valuable experiences and lessons can improve new work. So, what experiences have we gained from this aphid control work?

(1) The combination of technology and administration is very necessary: Because administrative cadres have a thorough understanding of the local situation, and the masses are willing to trust them, their words can play a greater role. In aphid control work, our method of combining with administration generally takes the following steps:

First, our work is carried out under the unified plan and leadership of the local administrative organs. This is a valuable experience;

Second, after going to the countryside, take the initiative to contact the district government to understand the local situation and the concerns of the masses, and exchange work opinions with each other, and then decide on the allocation of forces, work steps, and focus;

Third, through the District Production Committee, transform the promotion of technical work into administrative power;

Fourth, take advantage of the opportunity of the district government to convene various village cadre meetings, attend the propaganda and teach aphid control methods, and conduct experiments on the spot to allocate medicines, which played a great role;

Fifth, in coordination with administrative cadres, some working groups are headed by administrative cadres, who are responsible for mobilizing the masses and all other administrative-related matters. The technical work comrades of our farm serve as deputy leaders, responsible for all technical guidance work.

Through such close integration, the progress of the work has received the effect of mutual assistance.

In addition, it is also necessary to combine with the cooperatives. The supply of tobacco lime is collectively purchased by the district cooperative, and the four districts purchased 2,031 jin of tobacco powder and 2,393 jin of lime, which are stored in the key cotton villages and sold to the masses at the original price, so that the villagers can avoid the trouble of buying individually at the market, and the quality is good and the price is low, achieving twice the result with half the effort.

(2) Technology was improved from work: This time the medicine we used for aphid control was tobacco lime water. At the beginning, we did not have much confidence in the combination of this medicine. Later, in actual work, we considered that the efficiency of the medicine should be high, and drug damage should be avoided, saving manpower and saving medicinal materials. From these conditions, we comprehensively researched and tested, and we confirmed the efficacy of tobacco lime water and studied the formulation and usage. Practical work has proved that this is a mature method, which is worth promoting on a large scale everywhere next year, so we think it is necessary to introduce it in detail here.

1. Reasons why tobacco lime water is worth promoting on a large scale: First, the efficiency is high. According to the survey in actual work, the insecticidal efficiency is on average above 90%, and it does not burn the leaves and there is no drug damage. Second, the price is cheap. This year, the most serious aphids can be treated twice. Each mu uses three or four jin of tobacco leaves. Together with lime, the price of medicine per mu is much cheaper than ordinary foreign medicines. The masses can afford to treat it, and tobacco lime is something that is not lacking in the countryside. Third, it is easy to make. The preparation method of tobacco lime water is very simple. Only a few basins or jars and buckets are needed. There is no need to prepare special equipment, and there are no other complicated and difficult procedures. The villagers can easily master it. Fourth, it is easy to use. Spraying and dipping the plants can be done by women and children, not necessarily full labor force. Because of the above reasons, tobacco lime water is a good method that is easiest for farmers to accept and has great promotion prospects on the existing basis.

2. Dosage: One jin of tobacco powder, one jin of quicklime, sixty jin of water.

3. Preparation method: First, soak one jin of tobacco powder in ten jin of cold water for one day and one night. Use a flour sieve or a second-grade foreign flour bag to filter out the residue to make tobacco powder water. When using it, slowly add ten jin of water to one jin of lime to slake it, and also filter it to make lime water. Mix the two together to make the stock solution, then take one part of the medicine water (stock solution), add two parts of cold water, stir evenly, and you can use it.

If you need it urgently, you can add ten jin of water to one jin of tobacco powder, boil it in a pot, stop the fire and wait for five minutes, take it out to cool, and you can use it with lime.

4. Dosage: Using the plant-dipping method, when the seedlings are five or six inches high, an average of one mu uses one jin of tobacco powder. When it is about one foot high, it needs two jin of tobacco powder. Spraying requires at least twice as much as dipping the plants. Two jin of tobacco stalks are equivalent to one jin of tobacco powder.

5. Usage and precautions:

A. Both spraying with a sprayer and dipping the plants are fine. When spraying, it should be from bottom to top, hitting the back of the leaves. The curled leaves should be unfolded by hand and then carefully sprayed, otherwise it will be difficult to clean them. When dipping the plants, immerse all the cotton plants in the medicine water, and then pat them five or six times with your hands, and the aphids will die. Also, the spraying time should also be noted. Our experience is that spraying when the sun is strongest on a sunny day has the greatest effect. It is best not to use it on cloudy days. Furthermore, in order to make the medicinal power even, stir while using to avoid lime sedimentation.

B. The plant-dipping method is successful: In the actual situation where farmers generally lack sprayers, the plant-dipping method is worthy and necessary to promote. Practical work has proved that this method is successful, because it uses less medicine, and the labor force is not much more than a sprayer. More than 8,500 mu of cotton aphids that we treated were mostly achieved by this method. It is impossible to solve such a big problem with just a few sprayers.

6. Labor force required: Women and children can do this work. The plant-dipping method can treat one mu per person per day when the seedlings are five or six inches high. The spraying method can treat about two and a half mu per day with two people using one sprayer. If three people use two sprayers, they can treat about five mu per day.

7. Start early: In aphid control work, there is another important thing that should be paid close attention to, that is to "start early". Once aphids occur, they must be eliminated in time, and do not wait until they occur universally before treating them; because aphids have too much reproductive capacity, if one is killed when they first occur, it can reduce the harm of millions of aphids in the future, so when aphids occur, do not forget to "start early", otherwise you will get half the result with twice the effort.

8. Existing problems: Tobacco lime water is an insecticide with very high insecticidal efficiency. This is beyond doubt. However, it still has some problems of its own, such as the relationship between the amount of combination and the effective ingredients, the relationship between storage time and efficacy, the relationship with other insecticides, the concentration and drug damage problems, and its physical and chemical properties, all of which need further scientific theoretical research. Due to time and other conditions in our work, we have not achieved a deep understanding in this regard. We hope that agricultural work comrades from all over the world will discuss it together.

(3) We also gained some experience in mobilizing the masses: At the beginning of aphid control, the masses in various villages generally had various concerns in their minds, so the promotion of the work felt very tricky. Later, through the performance of actual work, this difficulty was overcome and it was smoothly carried out. Our experience is this:

1. Typical demonstration to break the masses' concerns: Farmers in the suburbs of Shijiazhuang are most troubled by aphids, because in recent years, growing foreign cotton has suffered from aphid disasters, and many villages have only harvested 30 to 40 jin per mu. They feel that aphids are a natural disaster that cannot be treated by humans. Only "God" has a solution. Some have a paralyzing ideology, thinking that aphids are still mild, it does not matter, they are afraid of spending money, afraid of delaying work, and use various words to prevaricate and are unwilling to treat. Some are afraid that tobacco lime water will burn the leaves. After we understood this situation, we immediately used investigation, persuasion, and typical demonstration to break the masses' concerns. The method of typical demonstration is to first do it once in the village where the district government is located, and then each group (three or four groups per district) will do it again in the key villages, and finally universally do it in each village. We made 46 typical demonstration households within half a month, which is a very effective method.

2. Help the masses to do it and enable them to master the technology: Through typical demonstrations, the masses know that this method does not cost much money, and the effect is not small, so they treat it one after another. We helped them to do it on the one hand and taught them to master the technology on the other hand. But after doing this for a few days, some villagers became dependent on us and asked us to take care of the treatment. Therefore, we emphasized the great power of propaganda among the masses and broke this dependence.

3. Mobilize the power of the masses and let go of the universal effort: After breaking the concerns and dependence of the masses, use the lunch break to go to the fields to carefully investigate the owner, mu number, aphid damage situation, and the amount of medicine used, and then patiently persuade and mobilize them. Personally run to his house and explain the aphid damage in his field, which side is heavy and which side is light, and how much medicine to use; if you don't believe it, go to the field with him to take a look, until you persuade him. In this way, the villagers know that we are sincerely helping them solve the problem, so they automatically and universally get started. At the same time, solve practical problems for farmers, such as collectively purchasing tobacco powder, which solves the trouble of buying medicine, and mobilizing women and children to solve the labor shortage.

　　石市郊区治蚜经验
    华北农场  杨清政  张永富  孙文克）
    蚜虫是棉花的最大敌人，每年各地棉花多因这种灾害而减收产量。今年石家庄市郊区的棉蚜，发生的比历年普遍而且严重，我们为使棉花不减收，于发生之初，立即动员了二十名技术干部，六十名学员，深入各村，展开了一个广泛的治蚜运动。经过两个多月（自五月二十六日至八月六日）的努力和苦斗，蚜虫基本上被消灭了，保证了石市郊区六十个农村中棉花的收成，并且取得很好的经验，打下了以后治蚜的巩固基础。现在我们把这一次治蚜运动中取得的经验，作一个有系统的介绍：
    一、蚜虫发生的新规律
    蚜虫的发生是有其一定的客观条件的，如季节、天气、空气的燥湿和枝叶的繁茂与否等，都有相当的关系。一般认为棉蚜的发生，天旱燥热是它的有利条件。但是今年石市郊区蚜虫的两次发生，有和以往不同的两个特点：第一是发生的较早。初发生是在六月初旬，棉苗刚刚五六寸高；第二是发生于湿热。第二次发生是在七月上旬，在这个时期内，阴雨连绵，气候湿热，蚜虫的发生和蔓延很厉害。由此可以说明蚜虫的发生不仅适于干旱，而且适于阴雨湿热。这些规律我们应当熟习的了解，并很好的注意，这对于预防蚜虫的发生和制止其蔓延是很重要的。
    二、获得了三大成绩
    在这一次两个多月的治蚜工作中，我们认为有意义、有价值的收获是这三点：
    （一）保证了石市郊区的棉蚜不成灾：石市郊区棉蚜发生后，我们就下了这样的决心，及时、普遍、周密的布置了我们的工作网，在两个月的时间内，我们防治了八千五百多亩的棉蚜，占植棉总面积的百分之四十八以上，实现了我们的决心和计划。如果今年石市棉蚜不及时防治，每亩产量，估计要减收三十市斤，八千五百多亩就会少收了二十五万千市斤，每斤籽棉以四斤小米计算，共值小米一百余万斤，这是多么惊人的数字啊！其次我们还有一个有意义的成就，就是一般农民都知道洋花产量大，品质好，很愿意种。但“十年九蚜”，常常打击了他们种洋花的信心。今年我们把蚜虫消灭了，保证了棉花不遭灾，因而使农民树立起敢种洋花而不怕蚜害的信心，替明年的推广工作打下了基础。
    （二）把技术交给了群众：单凭我们自己的力量不可能普遍完成广大面积的治蚜工作。因此我们便强调把技术交给群众，这样不仅可使农民认识技术的功效，而且能奠定以后工作的基础。今年在石市五、六、七、八四个区六十个村子里，我们把治蚜技术传授给了二百七十个有经验的农民和村干部，每个村子平均有四人以上掌握了熟练的治蚜技术，打下了明年治蚜工作的桥梁和基础。
    （三）从工作中锻炼了干部：在这一时期的工作中，同志们都充实了自己，锻炼了自己，不但在思想上更坚定了为人民服务的观点，并且在技术上取得了比较丰富的经验。全体工作同志（包括二十名干部、六十名学员）中，起码有百分之九十以上的人能够掌握熟练的正确的治蚜技术，在明年的治蚜工作上，每个同志都有独当一面的能力了。
    三、从工作中得到的经验
    工作中得到的经验，不论是成功的，或失败的，都是值得重视的。因为接受了这些宝贵的经验教训，对新的工作才能有所改进。那么，我们从这一次治蚜工作中，得到了那些经验呢？
    （一）技术与行政结合是非常必要的：因为行政干部们对地方上的情况了解透澈，群众对他们也肯信任，所以他们说话能起较大的作用。在治蚜工作中，我们与行政结合的方法，一般的采取这样的步骤：
    第一，我们的工作是在当地行政机关统一计划、统一领导下进行的。这是值得重视的经验；
    第二，下乡后，先和区政府主动取联系，了解地方情况及群众顾虑，并彼此交换工作意见，然后决定力量之配备和工作步骤及重心等；
    第三，通过区生产委员会，把推广技术工作变为行政上的力量；
    第四，利用区政府召开各项村干会议的机会，出席宣传及传授治蚜方法，并当场配药作实验，起了很大的作用；
    第五，与行政干部配合，有一些工作组由行政干部担任正组长，负责发动群众和一切别的行政有关事务，我们农场的技术工作同志，担任副组长，负责一切技术指导工作。
    经过这样密切的结合，工作的进行便收到了互为臂助的效果。
    另外，还须与合作社结合。烟草石灰的供应，是由区合作社负责集体购买的，四个区购买了烟末二千零三十一斤，石灰二千三百九十三斤，分别存放于棉花重点村，原价售给群众使用，因之使老乡可免于个别到集上购买的麻烦，而且品质好、价格低，收到事半功倍的效果。
    （二）从工作中改进了技术：这一次我们治蚜用的药品是烟草石灰水，在起初，对这药剂的配合使用，我们还没很大信心。后来在实际工作中，我们考虑到药剂的效率要高，并要避免药害，节省人力，节省药料，从这几个条件来综合研究试验，我们确认了烟草石灰水的效用并研究了配法和用法，从实际工作中已证明了这是一个成熟的方法，明年值得各地大量的推广，因此我们觉得在这里有详细介绍的必要。
    １、烟草石灰水值得大量推广的理由：第一效率高。根据实际工作中的调查，杀虫效率平均在百分之九十以上，而且不烧叶子没有药害。第二价钱贱。今年蚜虫最严重的治两次就可，每亩用烟叶三、四斤，连同石灰，一亩地的药价，比一般洋药贱得多，群众治得起，而且烟草石灰在乡村中是不缺的东西。第三容易制。烟草石灰水的配制法很简单，只用几个盆子或缸及水桶就可，不用备置特殊的器具，也没有其他复杂难办的手续，老乡很容易掌握。第四容易用。喷治和沾棵，妇女小孩都能做到，不是非全劳动力不可的。因为以上几个理由，所以烟草石灰水是农民在现有基础上最容易接受而大有推广前途的好方法。
    ２、配合量：烟末一斤、生石灰一斤、水六十斤。
    ３、配合法：先将烟末一斤，用冷水十斤泡一天一夜，用面箩或次洋面口袋滤去渣子，制成烟末水，使用时将石灰一斤慢慢加水十斤化开，也滤过制成石灰水，二者对在一起，制成原液，然后取药水（原液）一份，加冷水两份，搅拌均匀，便可使用。
    如急用时，可将烟末一斤，加水十斤，在锅内煮开，停火后待五分钟，取出晾凉，就可与石灰配合使用。
    ４、用药量：用沾棵法，在苗高五、六寸时，普通一亩用烟末一斤，到一尺上下的时候，需烟末二斤，喷射比沾棵最少多一倍，用烟梗二斤，顶烟末一斤。
    ５、使用法及注意事项：
    Ａ、用喷雾器喷射及沾棵都行，喷射时要从下而上，打在叶子的背面，卷缩的叶子应该用手展开再仔细的喷治，不然就很难干净。沾棵要将棉棵全部浸到药水里，再用手拍打五、六下，蚜虫就死了。还有喷治的时间，也应该注意，我们的经验是在晴天太阳最强的时候喷射，效果最大，阴天最好不用。再者，为使药力均匀，使用时要一边用一边搅拌，以免石灰沉淀。
    Ｂ、沾棵方法是成功的：在农民普遍缺乏喷雾器的实际情况下，沾棵法是值得而且必要提倡的。从实际工作中证明了这个法子是成功的，因为用药少，费劳动力比喷雾器也多不了多少。我们治的八千五百多亩棉蚜，大半都是用这个法子的成绩，单凭了几架喷雾器是解决不了这样大问题的。
    ６、需用之劳动力：这个工作，妇女、儿童都能干。沾棵法在苗高五、六寸时，每人一日可治一亩。喷治法两个人用一架喷雾器，一日可治二亩半上下，如三个人用两架喷雾器，一日可治五亩左右。
    ７、早下手：在治蚜工作中，还有一个重要的事应该很好的注意，就是要“早下手”，蚜虫一发生，就要及时消灭它，不要等到普遍发生了再去治；因为蚜虫的繁殖力太大，若初发生时，杀死一个，就能减少以后千百万个的蚜虫为害，所以当蚜虫发生时千万不要忘了“早下手”，否则就会事倍功半了。
    ８、存在的问题：烟草石灰水是一个杀虫效率很高的药剂，这是毫无疑问的。但它的本身，还存在着一些问题，如配合量与有效成分关系，保存时间与效力关系，与其他杀虫剂的关系，浓度及药害问题，及其理化性质等，都须要做进一步的科学理论研究。我们在工作中因时间和其他条件所限，在这方面还没有做到深刻的了解，希望各地农业工作同志共同来研讨。
    （三）发动群众也得了一些经验：在开始治蚜时，各村群众在思想上一般都存在着各种各样的顾虑，因之工作的推进，感到很大的棘手。后来经过了实际工作的表现，才把这种困难克服而顺利的搞起来。我们得到的经验是这样：
    １、典型示范打破群众的顾虑：石家庄郊区农民对蚜虫最感头痛，因为这几年来种洋棉花受蚜虫的灾害，有很多村庄每亩仅摘三、四十斤。他们感到蚜虫是闹天年，人治不了，只有“老天爷”有办法。有的有麻痹思想，认为蚜虫还轻，不要紧，怕化钱，怕耽误工作，用种种言辞来搪塞，不愿治。有的怕烟草石灰水烧叶子。我们了解了这种情况后，当即用调查说服及典型示范，打破了群众的顾虑。典型示范的作法，是首先在区政府所在的村子里作一次，然后各小组（每区分三、四个小组）再分别到重点村作一次，最后在每个村子里普遍的搞起来，在半个月内我们作了四十六个典型示范户，这是很收效果的办法。
    ２、帮着群众去搞，使他们掌握了技术：通过了典型示范，群众都知道这个法子花钱既不多，而且效力又不小，于是便接二连三的治起来。我们一面帮着去搞，一面教他们掌握技术，但这样搞了几天，一部老乡却依赖起我们，叫给包治了，因而我们又强调宣传群众的力量伟大，打破了这种依赖性。
    ３、发动群众力量，放手普遍的搞起来：打破了群众的顾虑和依赖性后，即利用午间休息时间到地里逐块仔细调查其户主、亩数、蚜害情形、用药量多少，再进行耐心说服和动员，亲自跑到他家里，说明他地里蚜害状况，那边重那边轻，要用多少药；若不信就和他一同到地里看看，到说服为止。这样一来老乡们知道我们是诚心诚意来给他们解决问题，便自动的普遍的搞起来，同时，给农民解决实际问题，如集体购烟末，解决了购药的麻烦，发动妇女、儿童解决了劳力的困难。
