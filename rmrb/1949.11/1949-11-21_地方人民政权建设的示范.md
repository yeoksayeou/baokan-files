　　A Model for Local People's Regime Construction

    The Second All-Circles People's Representative Conference of Beijing, which has been approved by the Central People's Government to exercise the functions and powers of the People's Congress, opened yesterday.

    This conference's exercise of the functions and powers of the People's Congress is in accordance with the provisions of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the instructions of Chairman Mao Zedong. The Common Program stipulates: "Before the convocation of the popularly elected local People's Congresses, the local All-Circles People's Representative Conferences shall gradually exercise the functions and powers of the People's Congress." Prior to this, on August 13 of this year, Chairman Mao said in his speech to the First All-Circles People's Representative Conference of Beijing: "I hope that all cities in the country can quickly convene similar conferences to strengthen the connection between the government and the people, assist the government in various construction works, overcome difficulties, and thereby prepare conditions for convening a popularly elected People's Congress." At that time, Chairman Mao also pointed out: "Once conditions are ripe, the current All-Circles People's Representative Conference can exercise the functions and powers of the People's Congress, become the highest authority in the city, and elect the Municipal Government." Chairman Mao also estimated the situation in Beijing, pointing out that "this can be done in about a few months. There are many benefits to doing so, and I hope the representatives will step up preparations." Now, after more than three months of preparation, the conditions in Beijing have matured, so it is entirely possible to do so. The people of Beijing, in accordance with their own will and desires, have gloriously fulfilled the task given to them by Chairman Mao with practical actions, advancing the construction of the local people's regime in the capital a big step forward under new conditions.

    What conditions are needed for the All-Circles People's Representative Conference to exercise the functions and powers of the People's Congress? This requires not only that the local Military Control Commission and the local People's Government lead the people in establishing revolutionary order, suppressing counter-revolutionary activities, and initially mobilizing and organizing the masses, but also that they rely on the closer unity of the local organizations of the Communist Party of China, the local democratic parties, people's organizations, and people from all walks of life; and rely on the rapid improvement of the political awareness of the people of all strata, be largely organized into various people's organizations, generally form an organized force, and form their own leading cadres, who can fully represent their will and desires and exercise democratic powers.

    At present, Beijing does have these conditions. Here, the remaining counter-revolutionary organizations and secret agents have suffered fatal blows, the revolutionary order is becoming more and more consolidated, most workers, students, teachers, farmers, and industrialists and businessmen have established organizations, and have initially formed their own leading cadres. They have been able to consciously play an active role in various construction undertakings, and they have been able to fully exercise democratic powers. This makes it possible and necessary for the Second All-Circles Representative Conference of Beijing to exercise the functions and powers of the People's Congress. At the same time, this All-Circles Representative Conference of Beijing was also directly influenced and educated by the spirit of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. This influence is enormous. It makes the people of all walks of life in the capital energetic, and it makes the several basic conditions that have already been met mature more quickly.

    Due to the above conditions, the content of the Second All-Circles People's Representative Conference of Beijing is also richer and more developed than the first. The total number of representatives participating in this conference has increased from 332 in the previous session to 424, because people's organizations from all walks of life have requested to increase their numbers. Representatives of organized people's organizations account for more than 70 percent of the total number of representatives. Such full representation is unprecedented in Beijing. This conference will not only further solve the specific construction guidelines and policies of the capital, but also elect the mayor, deputy mayors, and members of the Municipal People's Government Committee, forming the Municipal People's Government Committee. Such an All-Circles People's Representative Conference will undoubtedly have a positive demonstration effect on other parts of the country. We believe that as long as the conditions are ripe, all localities should, in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions and the provisions of the Common Program of the CPPCC, emulate Beijing's practice with preparation and step by step, further build local people's regimes, and more forcefully implement the people's democratic dictatorship.

    In recent months, All-Circles People's Representative Conferences have been held successively in major and many small and medium-sized cities that have been liberated throughout the country, making the connection between local people's governments and local people closer, solving a number of important issues in local construction work, and achieving great results. However, the functions and powers of the All-Circles People's Representative Conferences in many places are not only different from the fully elected People's Congresses, but also different from the Second All-Circles People's Representative Conference of Beijing, which exercises the functions and powers of the People's Congress. During the period when military control has not yet ended, land reform has not yet been thoroughly implemented, and people from all walks of life have not yet been fully organized, it is impossible to hold popular elections. Therefore, it is not possible to convene the People's Congress. However, from the experience of Beijing, we should recognize that as long as the political awareness of the local people is rapidly improved and they have been basically organized, the All-Circles People's Representative Conference may and should gradually expand its functions and powers; after obtaining the approval of the higher-level People's Government, such an All-Circles People's Representative Conference can exercise the functions and powers of the People's Congress. This is very beneficial to further building local people's regimes, implementing the people's democratic dictatorship, and restoring and developing production and various construction undertakings.

### 地方人民政权建设的示范

　　地方人民政权建设的示范
    获得中央人民政府批准执行人民代表大会职权的北京市第二届各界人民代表会议，已于昨日开幕。
    这个会议执行人民代表大会职权，是执行了人民政协共同纲领的规定和毛泽东主席的指示。共同纲领规定：“在普选的地方人民代表大会召开以前，由地方各界人民代表会议逐步地代行人民代表大会的职权。”在这以前，在本年八月十三日，毛主席在向北京市第一届各界人民代表会议讲话时，就已经说过：“希望全国各城市都能迅速召开同样的会议，加强政府与人民的联系，协助政府进行各项建设工作，克服困难，并从而为召集普选的人民代表大会准备条件。”当时毛主席又指出：“一俟条件成熟，现在方式的各界人民代表会议即可执行人民代表大会的职权，成为全市的最高权力机关，选举市政府。”　毛主席还估计了北京的情况，指出“大约几个月后，就可以这样做了。这样做的利益很多，希望代表们加紧准备。”现在北京市各界人民，经过了三个多月的准备，条件已经成熟了，因此完全可以这样做了。北京市的人民，按照自己的意志和愿望，用实际行动光荣地实现了毛主席所给予的任务，使首都的地方人民政权的建设，在新的条件下，向前推进了一大步。
    为了使各界人民代表会议执行人民代表大会的职权，需要一些什么的条件呢？这就不但需要在当地军事管制委员会和地方人民政府，领导人民建立了革命秩序，镇压了反革命活动，初步发动与组织了群众，而且需要依靠于中国共产党的地方组织和当地各民主党派、各人民团体及各界人民更加亲密的团结；需要依靠于各阶层人民政治觉悟的迅速提高，大量地组织到各种人民团体中去，普遍地形成了有组织的力量，并且形成了自己的领导骨干，能够充分代表自己的意志和愿望，行使民主权力。
    目前北京市确已具备了这些条件。在这里反革命的残余组织和特务分子已经遭受了致命的打击，革命秩序已日趋巩固，大部分工人、学生、教职员、农民和工商业界都已经建立了组织，并初步形成了自己的领导骨干。他们在各种建设事业中已经能够自觉地发挥积极的作用，他们已经能够充分行使民主的权力。这就使得北京市第二届各界代表会议执行人民代表大会的职权成为可能和必要的了。同时，这次北京市各界代表会议，还受了中国人民政治协商会议精神的直接影响和教育，这种影响是巨大的，它使首都各界人民精神奋发，它使得已经具备了的若干基本条件更加迅速成熟。
    由于上述的条件，就使北京市第二届各界人民代表会议的内容，较之第一届也更加充实与发展了。参加此次会议的代表总额，由于各界人民团体均要求增加，已从上届的三百三十二人增加到四百二十四人，而有组织的人民团体代表则占代表总额百分之七十以上，这样充分的代表性在北京市是前所未有的。这次会议不但要进一步解决首都各项具体建设方针和政策问题，而且要选举首都的市长、副市长和市人民政府委员，组成市人民政府委员会。这样性质的各界人民代表会议，对于全国其他地方，无疑地将发生积极的示范作用。我们认为，只要是条件成熟了的地方，都应该按照毛主席的指示、按照政协共同纲领的规定，有准备有步骤地仿效北京市的做法，进一步建设地方人民政权，更有力地实行人民民主专政。
    近数月来，在全国解放了的各大城市和许多中小城市，都曾先后召开各界人民代表会议，使各地人民政府和当地人民的连系更加密切，解决了各地建设工作中的若干重要问题，获得了很大的成绩。但是，许多地方的各界人民代表会议，在其职权上不仅不同于普选的全权的人民代表大会，而且也不同于执行人民代表大会职权的北京市第二届各界人民代表会议。在军事管制时期尚未结束，土地改革尚未彻底实现，各界人民尚未充分组织起来的时候，不可能实行普选，因此，还不能召开人民代表大会。但是从北京市的经验中，我们应该认识：只要当地人民政治觉悟迅速提高，并已基本组织起来的条件下，各界人民代表会议就可能也应该逐渐扩大其职权；在获得上级人民政府批准之后，这样的各界人民代表会议就可以执行人民代表大会的职权。这对于进一步建设地方人民政权，实行人民民主专政，恢复与发展生产和各种建设事业是有很多益处的。
