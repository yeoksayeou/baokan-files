Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 25th: According to TASS, New York: The United Nations Political Committee held a heated debate on the 15th and 16th on the Soviet proposal to condemn preparations for a new war and the five major powers concluding a peace pact to strengthen peace. This debate gave new exposure to the aggressive plans of the enemies of peace—the US-British bloc.

The US representative Austin and the head of the British delegation, McNair, both delivered lengthy speeches at the meeting. They attempted to shift the blame for undermining peace to the Soviet Union. The US and Britain jointly proposed a so-called empty proposal of "essentials of peace," attempting to replace the Soviet proposal with this. As lackeys of US imperialism, French representative Chauvel, Canadian representative Martin, Yugoslav representative Djilas, and others echoed their views and tried to smear the Soviet Union. These speeches were sharply criticized by Czechoslovak representative Clementis and Polish representative Wierblowski. The Soviet delegation leader Vyshinsky's long speech on the 16th, lasting nearly four hours, especially powerfully struck the US-British bloc. He listed indisputable facts, refuted the various absurd arguments of the representatives of the US-British bloc one by one, and once again thoroughly exposed the conspiracy of the warmongers to prepare for a new war to the people of the world.

The representatives of the US and Britain said that the UN Charter was enough, that concluding a five-power peace pact was superfluous repetition, and was "propaganda" (Austin). They said that there was actually no threat of war in the world, and that the purpose of the North Atlantic Treaty was "defense." They said that the Soviet Union maintains a huge military budget, that Marxism-Leninism believes that war is an inevitable product of capitalism, and therefore the Soviet Union has no sincerity in defending peace (Martin). They said that the Soviet Union raised an "Iron Curtain," isolating itself from the outside world and opposing cultural exchanges (McNair).

All these "arguments," which exhausted the ability to slander, were thoroughly refuted by Vyshinsky. Vyshinsky first pointed out that none of the spokesmen of the US-British bloc dared to face and deny any of the facts he listed in his speech to the Political Committee on the 14th. They dared not answer questions, and they tried to divert attention with empty clamor.

In order to answer Austin's question of demanding more facts, Vyshinsky gave a very detailed account of the fact that the United States maintained 484 naval and air force bases in the Pacific and Atlantic after the war, the process of the United States obtaining Cyprus as a base from Britain, and the process of bargaining with Franco to obtain Spanish bases, the process of the United States deeply plundering Arctic bases, and many other facts. Vyshinsky said that all this proves that the US and Britain are indeed preparing for a new war of aggression against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries.

Vyshinsky then exposed the nonsense that the North Atlantic Treaty was a pact to maintain peace and security. He asked: If the North Atlantic Treaty is also for peace, why does the United States hinder the formulation of measures to establish UN armed forces?

Vyshinsky answered the shameless lie of Tito's group representative Djilas, who slandered the Soviet Union for destroying the Soviet-Yugoslav Friendship Treaty. He cited the facts exposed in the trial of Rajk in Hungary to prove that long before the Soviet Union abolished the Soviet-Yugoslav Friendship Treaty, the Yugoslav government had carried out activities hostile to the Soviet Union and trampled this treaty underfoot. After citing Djilas repeating Bevin's speech word for word, he pointed out that the representatives of the Tito group have become more and more thorough members of the imperialist camp.

In refuting the Canadian representative Martin's foolish remarks distorting Marxism-Leninism, Vyshinsky clearly expounded Lenin's teachings on the United Nations platform. He pointed out that it is precisely according to Lenin's teachings that, although war is a phenomenon inherent in capitalism, democratic forces can still thwart war and prevent war with their unity, war-stopping power, and determination. When Vyshinsky refuted this Canadian Senator Martin, Martin interjected that he was not a senator. Vyshinsky pointed out: When something does not conform to the facts, it is possible to reply immediately, which encourages me, because I have been speaking here for nearly an hour and a half, and this is the first denial of what I said.

Vyshinsky then sharply answered McNair's absurd statement that the people of the world fear the Soviet Union and that the Soviet Union has no friends. He pointed out that all people who uphold peace are friends of the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union has more and more friends. Vyshinsky said to McNair: "If you imagine that the person sitting in the seat marked 'China' is the representative of the Chinese people, that would be a most painful assumption."

Vyshinsky also answered McNair's request to know the Soviet military expenditure. He cited figures to show that the Soviet Union's military expenditure this year accounts for 19 percent of total expenditure, while Britain's is 30 percent and the United States' is 34 percent. If direct and indirect military expenditures are included, it is 69 percent, totaling 30 billion US dollars. Vyshinsky also talked about how the Soviet Union rescued the crisis encountered by the US and British troops on the Western Front in the last war. He read out the telegrams between Stalin and Churchill to warn the slanderers of the Soviet Union that they should be more cautious in their views on the Soviet Union.

　　联大政委会讨论苏联和平公约提案
  　维辛斯基痛斥美英集团狡辩  历举事实揭穿战贩备战阴谋
    【新华社北京二十五日电】据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国政治委员会于十五、十六两日热烈辩论苏联提出的关于谴责新战争准备与五强缔结加强和平公约的提案。这一辩论对和平的敌人——美英集团的侵略计划，又给予新的暴露。
    美国代表奥斯汀、英国代表团长麦克奈尔，都在会上发表了长篇演说，他们企图把破坏和平的罪名转嫁予苏联，美英并联合提出了所谓“和平要义”的空洞提案，妄图以此来代替苏联的提案。作为美帝国主义喽啰的法国代表乔维尔、加拿大代表马丁、南斯拉夫代表德热拉斯与?壤?薄⑿挛骼肌⒌ぢ蟆⒚芈车裙?拇?恚?嗳浩鸱⒀杂?汀５?牵??些发言分别受到捷克斯洛伐克代表克里门蒂斯与波兰代表维尔布洛夫斯基的尖锐抨击，而苏联代表团团长维辛斯基在十六日发表的、几近四小时的长篇演说，特别有力地打击了美英集团，他历举不容置辩的事实，逐一驳斥了美英集团各国代表的各种荒谬论点，并将战争贩子准备新战争的阴谋，再一次彻底地暴露在世界人民的面前。
    美英的代表们说，只要有联合国宪章就够了，缔结五强和平公约是多余的重复，是“宣传”（奥斯汀）；他们说，世界上其实并没有战争的威胁，北大西洋公约的目的是在“防御”；他们说：苏联维持巨大的军事预算，马列主义认为战争是资本主义不可避免的产物，因而苏联没有诚意保卫和平（马丁）；他们说，苏联张起“铁幕”与外界隔绝，反对文化交流（麦克奈尔）。
    所有这一切极尽诽谤之能事的“论点”，都为维辛斯基驳斥得体无完肤。维辛斯基首先指出，美英集团的发言人没有一个敢于面对并否认他在十四日在政委会演说中所列举的任何一件事实，他们不敢答复问题，他们企图以毫无内容的叫嚣来转移视听。
    为了答复奥斯汀要求举出更多事实的这一问题，维辛斯基十分详尽地举出美国战后在太平洋与大西洋保持四百八十四个海空军基地的事实，举出美国从英国取得塞浦路斯为基地的经过，以及和佛朗哥讨价还价取得西班牙基地的经过，举出美国深入掠取北极基地的经过与其他的许多事实。维辛斯基说，所有这一切，都证明美英确实在进行侵略苏联与人民民主国家的新战争准备。
    维辛斯基接着揭穿了北大西洋公约乃是维护和平与安全的公约的胡说，他问道：如果说北大西洋公约也是为了和平的话，为什么美国还要阻碍拟定建立联合国武装部队的措施呢？
    维辛斯基答复了铁托集团的代表德热拉斯诬蔑苏联破坏苏南友好条约的无耻谎言，他历举由匈牙利拉伊克案审讯中暴露出来的事实，证明早在苏联废除苏南友好条约以前，南斯拉夫政府就进行敌视苏联的活动，而把这一条约采在脚下了。他在举出德热拉斯逐字逐句重复贝文的发言以后，指出铁托集团的代表们，已日甚一日地成为澈头澈尾的帝国主义阵营的分子了。
    在驳复加拿大代表马丁歪曲马列主义的愚妄的发言时，维辛斯基在联合国的讲台上明确地阐明了列宁的教义，他指出：恰恰是根据列宁的教训，尽管战争是资本主义所固有的现象，民主力量仍然能挫败战争，能以他们的团结一致、阻止战争的力量与决心来防止战争。维辛斯基在驳斥这一加拿大参议员马丁时，马丁曾插言说他不是参议员。维辛斯基指出：当一些事情不符合事实时，就有立即答复的可能，这鼓励了我，因为我在这里已演说了将近一个半钟头，这还是对我所说的话的第一个否认。
    维辛斯基接着尖锐地答复了麦克奈尔所谓世界人民惧怕苏联，苏联没有朋友的谰言。他指出，一切拥护和平的人民都是苏联的朋友，苏联的朋友正越来越多。维辛斯基对着麦克奈尔说道：“如果你设想那个坐在标着‘中国’席位上的人是中国人民的代表，那就会是一种最痛苦的设想”。
    维辛斯基又答复麦克奈尔要求知道苏联军费的要求。他举出数字说明，苏联今年的军费占全部岁出的百分之十九，而英国是百分之三十，美国是百分之三十四，而如果直接间接用于军事的费用都算进去，那就有百分之六十九，共达三百亿美元。维辛斯基又谈到苏联如何在上次大战中解救了美英军队在西线所遭到的危机，他宣读了斯大林与邱吉尔来往的电报，以此正告苏联的诽谤者在对苏联的看法上应该检点些。
