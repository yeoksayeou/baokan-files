    [Beijing News] The first Beijing Municipal Women's Congress is about to be held. Since the Preparatory Committee of the Municipal Women's Federation issued a notice on the 1st of this month, all units have been enthusiastically carrying out the election of representatives. As of 5:00 PM yesterday (the 12th), 322 representatives had registered with the Preparatory Committee of the Municipal Women's Federation. This includes 60 workers, 25 rural women from suburban areas, 29 educators, 27 students, 11 childcare workers, 10 medical workers, 11 cultural and artistic workers, 2 scientific workers, 4 journalists, 3 industrialists, 33 representatives from various women's organizations, 39 from government agencies, 5 from the military, 3 from ethnic minorities, and 60 from various districts. Only 49 people have not yet reported due to various reasons. All units attach great importance to this congress, especially the female workers and women from various districts, who earnestly elected their representatives. Female workers proposed that the primary qualifications for candidacy should be the ability to serve everyone, good production, and active learning. At the Renli Carpet Factory, during the mutual election of candidates in the carpet industry, they voluntarily ceded two representative positions to carpet factories in other districts, fully demonstrating the spirit of mutual assistance and comradely love among the working class. When electing representatives of workers' family members, military personnel, cadres, family members of martyrs, working women, and housewives in various districts, they used various democratic methods such as voting, bean counting, button counting, line drawing, and hand selection. Many young women and old ladies vied to speak on stage and compete with each other. At a mass election meeting in the Fourth Police Station of the Inner Six Districts alone, more than 20 women spoke. This fully demonstrates that the political consciousness of Beijing women has been raised since liberation.
