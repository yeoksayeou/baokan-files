　　Beijing News: The first meeting of the Beijing Second Session of the People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee was held yesterday (the 25th). The attendees included Chairman Peng Zhen, Vice Chairmen Liu Ren, Liang Sicheng, Yu Xinqing, and 41 committee members. One member was absent, and three were excused. The meeting unanimously approved Xue Zizheng, the Secretary-General of the Second Session of the Representative Conference, and Deputy Secretaries-General Zhang Wensong, Cui Yueli, Guo Zechen, Cao Zhilin, Liao Mosha, and Sun Fuling as the Secretary-General and Deputy Secretaries-General of the Consultative Committee. Subsequently, the committee members reviewed the successes, shortcomings, and experiences of the People's Representative Conference. Finally, Consultative Committee Chairman Peng Zhen made a summary. Regarding the dissemination of the spirit and resolutions of the meeting, it was decided that the content should include: 1. Restore and develop production; 2. Complete tax collection work; 3. Eliminate counter-revolutionaries and feudal remnants; 4. Develop cultural and educational undertakings, and establish amateur remedial schools; 5. Worker layoffs and relief issues. The overall dissemination should focus on developing production and completing tax collection. The method of dissemination will be carried out separately by representatives of each unit within their respective systems. The main points of dissemination will be drafted by the secretariat, reviewed by the chairman and vice-chairmen, and then printed and distributed to the consultative committee members for reference.
    Regarding the issue of grain and coal supply, Lin Jie, manager of the Beijing Coal and Iron Branch Company, reported on the city's winter coal supply plan and the current supply and demand situation. Manager Lin explained in his report that the production and supply of coal for domestic use this winter can basically meet demand. The supply methods are: 1. The supply of coal for government agencies, troops, and schools will be based on the standards stipulated by the former North China People's Government. Each unit will submit a winter coal budget, which will be approved by the Municipal Finance Bureau, and then the company will uniformly allocate and sell it. The main problem at present is organizing the transportation of coal by the various units. 2. For the supply of coal to cooperative members, the company has decided to give preferential treatment to the Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative by supplying 28,000 tons of coal for domestic use, which can solve the fuel needs of approximately 250,000 cooperative members. 3. For the supply of coal to coal merchants and the general public, the company will supply coal dust to coal shops for processing into briquettes. Both parties have stipulated retail prices and briquette standards. Contracts have been signed with 84 coal shops, and it is planned to increase this number to 150 in order to solve the coal problem for the general poor. In addition, it is stipulated that citizens can purchase coal from the company with their household registration forms; coal merchants can establish coal accounts with their business licenses and purchase one ton each time. To prevent coal merchants from hoarding and manipulating coal prices, the company has stopped selling coal to coal yards since late November. Subsequently, Mayor Nie reported on the city's grain problem. Not only are the grain sources in the Northeast and Northwest unobstructed, but the government is also preparing to store sufficient grain to supply the citizens. Regarding the grain profiteers who have been arrested, such as Wang Zhenting, the committee members all advocated for strict punishment, to knock out the teeth of the "grain tigers" so that they can no longer bite people.

　　京各界人民代表会协商委员会首次会议
    总结本届大会经验  讨论传达决议内容
  　聂市长等报告粮煤供应情形
    【北京讯】北京市第二届各界人民代表会议协商委员会昨（二十五）日举行首次会议。到会主席彭真、副主席刘仁、梁思成、余心清和委员共四十一人，缺席一人，请假三人。会上一致通过以第二届代表会议的秘书长薛子正及副秘书长张文松、崔月犁、郭则忱、曹志麟、廖沫沙、孙孚凌为协商委员会的秘书长和副秘书长。接着由各委员检讨本届人民代表会议的成功、缺点和经验。最后，由协商委员会主席彭真作总结。关于传达会议的精神和决议，决定传达内容应包括：一、恢复与发展生产，二、完成税收工作，三、肃清反革命和封建残余，四、发展文教事业，开办业余补习学校，五、工人解雇与救济问题。整个传达以发展生产和完成税收为重点。传达的方式，则由各单位代表在所属系统分别进行，传达要点由秘书处起草，交主席、副主席审查后，印发各协商委员参考。
    谈到粮、煤供应问题，当由北京市煤铁分公司经理林洁报告本市冬季烧煤供应计划及目前供求情况。林经理在报告中说明今冬门煤产量与供给基本上可以达到供应的地步。供给办法是：一、对机关、部队、学校用煤的供给，均由各单位按前华北人民政府规定的标准，提出冬季用煤预算，经市政府财政局批准后，由该公司统一配售。目前主要问题为组织各单位运煤。二、对合作社社员用煤供给办法，该公司决定优待供给市供销总社门煤二万八千吨，约能解决合作社二十五万社员的燃煤问题。三、对煤商及一般市民用煤供给办法，由该公司供给煤末，让煤铺加工制成煤球，双方规定零售价格及煤球标准。现已与八十四家煤铺订立合同，计划增至一百五十家，以解决一般贫苦市民用煤问题。此外，并规定市民可凭户口单到该公司购煤；煤商可凭营业照订立煤摺，每次卖给一吨。为防止煤栈大量囤积居奇，操纵煤价，该公司从十一月下旬起，已停止售煤给煤栈。继由聂市长报告本市粮食问题，现在不但东北、西北粮源畅通，政府并准备储存充分的粮食以供给市民。对已加逮捕的粮食奸商王振庭等，各委员都主张严办，要敲掉“粮老虎”的牙齿，使它再也不能咬人。
