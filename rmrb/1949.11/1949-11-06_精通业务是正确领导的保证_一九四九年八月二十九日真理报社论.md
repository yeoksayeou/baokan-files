Mastery of Business is the Guarantee of Correct Leadership
　　— An Editorial from the "Pravda" on August 29, 1949
　　The Lenin-Stalin Party is the organizer and inspirer of all the victories of the Soviet people. As a ruling party, it bears the full responsibility for deciding the fate of the country, guiding the country forward with unwavering will and full confidence. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and under the guidance of Comrade Stalin, the Soviet Union has become a country with a first-class socialist industry and the world's largest advanced socialist agriculture. Socialism has undoubtedly achieved victory in all sectors of the national economy.
　　Our Party has set a brilliant example of carrying out transformation and construction. The glorious socialist country has withstood the test of the Great Patriotic War and is currently smoothly solving the tasks of post-war construction. The indestructible power, cultivated in its short historical period, is undeniable proof of the Communist Party's wisdom in construction.
　　What is the source of the Bolshevik Party's strength? It lies primarily in the fact that all of our Party's activities are guided by the great and invincible theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin. These great theories accurately reflect the needs of social and material life development, enabling the Party to never make mistakes in solving the most complex problems in our construction endeavors. In all its leadership work, our Party has always relied on all achievements of culture and advanced science and technology.
　　The Communist Party's comprehensive leadership of socialist construction has a solid scientific foundation. True scientificity, deep and comprehensive mastery of business, is the most outstanding feature of our Party's activities. Each of its resolutions and instructions summarizes the vast experience of the masses in their struggle for communism.
　　If our Party cadres cannot stubbornly master science and technology, then our Party cannot lead economic and cultural construction so successfully. Lenin and Stalin called on every Communist Party member to study science diligently and delve deeply into business. In the early years of the transformation period, when the Soviet state was just beginning large-scale construction, Comrade Stalin said:
　　"To build, one must know, one must master science, and to know, one must learn. Study! Study patiently, study stubbornly!…
　　Mastering science, cultivating new Bolshevik experts and cadres in all fields of knowledge, learning, learning, learning most stubbornly, this is our current task." The Party has cultivated tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of skilled Bolshevik leaders for various production sectors of the national economy. The noble qualities, training, and skills of these cadres are vividly manifested in their leadership of economic and cultural construction. Based on advanced scientific and technological materials, they are solving the most complex problems. After a short period, Party organizations and production leadership organs of large industrial enterprises in areas that had been occupied by the German bandits, are successfully solving unprecedented production tasks assigned to them in economic recovery and construction. The same is true for leading agriculture based on the achievements of advanced agricultural biology.
　　The complex tasks stipulated for the process of communist construction place increasingly high demands on our cadres responsible for leadership work. In order to successfully solve the many problems in the process of communist construction, our Party affairs cadres should tirelessly improve their scientific and technological level and expand their horizons. To correctly lead the work of factories, collective farms, and machine tractor stations, ordinary common sense is no longer sufficient; concrete and profound knowledge of economic and production technology is required.
　　The interests of communist construction require us to accelerate the improvement of production technology and increase labor productivity in the industrial sector by all means. Without technological improvements and improvements in the organization of labor, it is impossible to achieve further upsurges in enterprise work. Therefore, it is natural that the following series of tasks are entirely presented to the Party organizations in industrial areas: to master advanced technology science, to make it more perfect, and to deeply study the economics of production management.
　　The interests of communist construction require a new and more rapid upsurge in socialist agriculture, and require the creation of an extremely abundant state of agricultural products in the country. In order to be good at leading agricultural production, Party affairs workers should master the science of transforming nature embodied in Michurin's advanced biology.
　　In the current conditions, the ideological education work of the Party and the communist education work of the working people are of utmost importance. To realize the leadership of all ideological education work departments, our cadres are required to improve their ideological level, deeply study problems in the fields of science, literature, and art, and be good at using all the Party's propaganda weapons to carry out communist education.
　　To realize leadership, one must master business!
　　Party affairs workers who do not care about improving their ideological and political level, who do not care about expanding their horizons, can no longer prove the trust placed in them by the Party and the people. Such workers will inevitably lag behind life and be dragged behind the development of affairs.
　　Among us, there are still leaders who are unwilling to study science diligently and delve into business. In his speech "On the Tasks of Economic Workers," Comrade Stalin said that such leaders are very much like the blind governors in Saltykov-Shchedrin's novels, who believe that their job is to sign documents. If you want them to understand affairs, master technology, and become experts, they will say "no" several times.
　　Of course, it must also be pointed out that "activists" like blind governors are already extremely rare here. It would be unfair not to point this out. However, precisely because they are so rare, they are even more intolerable. The vast majority of our Party organizations are proficient in their business in leading economic work and have fully mastered scientific and technological knowledge. Recently, Party affairs workers have greatly strengthened their efforts to improve their ideological and political level, expand their scientific and technological horizons, and increase their knowledge of economics.
　　Lenin said:
　　"To build communism, it is necessary to master technology and master science, and to make technology and science accessible to a wider class."
　　All our Party affairs workers and all Communist Party members, while fulfilling their primary obligation—studying Marxism-Leninism—should also tirelessly master scientific and technological materials and constantly transmit scientific and technological knowledge to the broad masses of working people. This is not an easy task. However, as Comrade Stalin pointed out, science, technical experience, and knowledge—all these can be obtained. If you don't have it today, you will have it tomorrow. The main thing here is to have the Bolshevik's ardent desire to master technology and master science. As long as there is an ardent desire, everything can be done and everything can be solved.

　　精通业务是正确领导的保证
  　一九四九年八月二十九日真理报社论
    列宁——斯大林党，是苏联人民一切胜利的组织者与鼓舞者。做为一个执政党，她肩负着决定国家命运的全部责任，意志坚强充满信心的引导着国家前进。在共产党领导下，在斯大林同志引导下，苏联已经成为具有头等社会主义工业与世界上规模最大的先进社会主义农业的国家。社会主义已经毫无例外的在国民经济一切部门中取得了胜利。
    我们党做出了进行改造与建设工作的光辉范例。社会主义国家光荣的经受了卫国战争的考验，目前正在顺利解决着战后建设任务，其在短短历史时期中锻炼出来的坚不可摧的威力，是共产党建设智慧不可置辩的明证。
    布尔什维克党力量的泉源何在呢？它首先在于：我们党的全部活动，都是以马、恩、列、斯伟大不可战胜的学说为指南。这伟大学说正确反映社会物质生活发展的需要，使党在解决我们建设事业中最复杂问题时永远不犯错误。在自己全部领导工作中，我们党向来依靠文化与先进科学技术界的一切成就。
    共产党领导社会主义建设的全部多方面的活动，都是有着巩固科学基础的。真实的科学性，深刻而全面的精通业务，是我们党的活动最出色的地方。她的每个决议，每个指示，都总结着群众在为共产主义而斗争的巨大经验。
    假如我们党的干部不能顽强的精通科学与掌握技术，那么，我们党就不能如此成功的领导经济文化建设事业。列宁和斯大林号召每个共产党员，艰忍刻苦的学习科学，深刻的钻研业务。还在改造时期的头几年，当苏维埃国家刚刚开始巨大规模建设的时候，斯大林同志说过：
    “要建设，就要知道，要精通科学，而要知道，就必须学习。学习！要耐心的学习，顽强的学习！………
    精通科学，在一切知识领域内培养出新的布尔什维克专家，干部，学习，学习，最顽强的学习，这就是我们目前的任务”。党已经为国民经济各种各样的生产部门，培养了数万乃至数十万个熟练的布尔什维克领导者。这些干部高贵的品质、锻炼、技能鲜明的表现在他们对经济文化建设事业的领导工作中。根据先进科学技术的材料，他们正解决着最复杂的问题。遭受过德寇占领地区的大工业企业的党的组织和生产领导机关，经过了一个很短的时期以后，正在顺利解决着为他们在经济恢复与建设工作中前所未见的生产任务。在领导以先进农业生物学的成就为基础的农业方面，情形也是这样。
    为共产主义建设过程所规定的复杂任务，对我们负责领导工作的干部，提出了越来越高的要求。为着顺利解决共产主义建设过程中的许多问题，我们党务工作的负责干部，应该不疲倦的提高自己科学技术水平，扩展自己的眼界。为着正确领导工厂、集体农庄、机器拖拉机站的工作，现在仅有普通常识，已经不够用了，需要有管理经济与生产技术的具体的深刻的知识。
    共产主义建设的利益，要求我们目前在工业部门中，尽一切方法加速生产技术的改进，提高劳动生产率。没有技术方面的改进，没有在组织劳动力方面的改进，就不可能在企业工作中达到进一步的高涨。所以很自然的，在工业区党的组织面前，全然提出了下面一系列的任务，要精通先进的技术科学，要使它更加完善，要深刻钻研管理生产的经济学。
    共产主义建设的利益，要求社会主义农业新的更为迅速的高涨，要求在国内造成农业产品极为丰盈的状态。为着善于领导农业生产，党务工作者应该精通体现于米邱林先进生物学中的改造自然的科学。
    在目前条件下，党组织的思想教育工作，对劳动人民的共产主义教育工作，有着极为重要的意义。实现对一切思想教育工作部门的领导，要求我们干部提高自己的思想水平，深刻钻研科学、文学、艺术领域内的问题，要求我们干部善于利用党的一切宣传武器进行共产主义教育。
    要实现领导，就必须精通业务！
    不关心提高自己思想政治水平，不关心扩展自己眼界的党务工作者，已经再不能证实党和人民对他的信赖了，这样的工作者，将必然落后于生活而被拖在事务发展的尾巴上。
    在我们中间还有着不愿刻苦学习科学钻研业务的领导者。斯大林同志在“论经济工作人员底任务”的演说中，说这样的领导者很象谢德林小说中的瞎知事，他们认为他们的工作就是签署文件，如果你要他们谙通事理，精通技术，变成内行，那他们就会连说几个“不”字。
    自然也必须指出：象瞎知事那样的“行动家”，在我们这里已经是绝无仅有的了，不如此指出，是不公平的。但是，正因为他们是绝无仅有，也就更加不可容忍。我们绝大多数党的组织，在领导经济工作方面，是精通业务的，是充分掌握科学技术知识的。最近期间以来，党务工作者在提高自己思想政治水平，扩展自己科学技术眼界，增加经济学知识等方面的努力，是大为加强了。
    列宁说过：
    “要建设共产主义，就要掌握技术，掌握科学，要使得技术与科学，为更广泛的阶层所接触”。
    我们一切党务工作者，一切共产党员，于尽自己首要义务——学习马列主义理论——之同时，还应该不疲倦的掌握科学技术材料，经常的把科学技术知识输送到广泛的劳动群众中去，这不是一件容易事情。但是，正如斯大林同志所指示的，科学、技术经验、知识，——凡此种种都是可以求得的东西。今天没有，明天就会有了。这里主要的就是要有布尔什维克的热烈志愿去精通技术，精通科学。只要有热烈志愿，那就一切都可办到，一切都可解决。
