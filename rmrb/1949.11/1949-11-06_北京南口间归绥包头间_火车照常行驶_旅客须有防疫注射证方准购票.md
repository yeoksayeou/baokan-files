　　【Beijing News】The Beijing-Suiyuan Railway line between Beijing and Nankou, and between Guisui and Baotou, is still operating as usual. Passengers taking trains at stations between Nankou and Xizhimen must have proof of vaccination from the epidemic prevention authorities in order to purchase tickets and board the train. However, during the period when vaccines are unavailable and vaccinations cannot be administered, passengers taking trains at Nankou, Changping, and Shahe stations must have proof from the local government confirming that they are local residents in order to purchase tickets and board the train. If there are passengers returning from other areas (non-plague-affected areas) to these three stations, they will also be allowed to purchase tickets and board the train if they have symbols or other sufficient evidence, but all passengers must undergo general quarantine at the quarantine station upon arrival at Xizhimen. Luggage, parcels, and goods sent mutually between stations between Nankou and Xizhimen, except for fur products, old and dirty items that easily spread germs, will be accepted only after being inspected and disinfected by the quarantine station. In addition, the Ministry of Railways has instructed employees at stations between Nankou and Xizhimen to strictly disinfect the inside of passenger cars, toilets, washrooms, platforms, and waiting rooms at each station within the area.
