Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 23rd—Abdulla, Vice Chairman of the World Federation of Trade Unions and Secretary-General of the Sudanese Trade Union Federation of Africa, spoke at the Beijing people's rally celebrating the success of the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference:

	Dear Comrades: I am very pleased to pay my respects to you in the name of the workers in the ranks of the World Federation of Trade Unions. I am especially pleased to convey the fraternal greetings of the people of the African colonies to you. They are watching the liberation war waged by the Chinese people with great concern, and they admire your great leader Comrade Mao Zedong. They feel supremely happy about the establishment of the great People's Republic of China, which has strengthened the democratic and peace camp with 475 million men and women. The future belongs to the people. The Chinese people, united around their working class, have become masters of their own destiny.

	After being liberated from the rule of foreign imperialism and domestic Kuomintang reactionaries, they, like the Soviet Union and the European people's democratic countries, will be able to strive for the continuous improvement of workers' living conditions. In completing this enormous task, your trade unions will play an extremely important role.

	Comrades! The struggle waged by workers and people in every corner of the world for a better life and freedom will consolidate the gains already made and will consolidate socialist construction in other parts of the world. The victory over imperialism is already guaranteed.

	We will strengthen the unity and solidarity within the World Federation of Trade Unions, which is the only international workers' organization regardless of gender, race, religion, or political belief.

	Long live the Beijing Trade Union!
	Long live the All-China Federation of Trade Unions!
	Long live the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference!
	Long live the World Federation of Trade Unions!

　　非洲殖民地的人民都钦佩毛泽东同志
　　阿勃杜拉讲话
    【新华社北京二十三日电】世界工联副主席、非洲苏丹工会联合会总书记阿勃杜拉在北京人民庆祝亚澳工会会议成功大会上的讲话：
    亲爱的同志们：我很愉快地以世界工联队伍行列中的工人们的名义，向你们致敬礼。我尤其愉快地向你们传达非洲殖民地人民的兄弟般的敬礼。他们以极大的关怀注视着中国人民所进行的解放战争、他们钦佩你们的伟大领袖毛泽东同志。他们对伟大的中华人民共和国的成立，感到无上的欢欣，中华人民共和国以四万万七千五百万的男女，增强了民主与和平阵营。未来是属于人民的。团结在其工人阶级周围的中国人民，已成为他们自身命运的主人。
    在自外国帝国主义和国内国民党反动分子的统治下获得解放后，他们正如苏联和欧洲人民民主国家一样，当能为工人生活条件的不断改善而努力。在完成这个巨大的任务上，你们的工会必将起着极为重要的作用。
    同志们！在世界任何角落的工人和人民为争取较好生活与自由而进行的斗争，都将巩固既得的阵地，并将巩固世界另一地区中的社会主义建设。战胜帝国主义已经获得保证。
    我们将加强世界工联内部的团结一致，它是唯一的不分性别、种族、宗教、或政治信仰的国际工人组织。
    北京工会万岁！
    中华全国总工会万岁！
    亚澳工会会议万岁！
    世界工联万岁！
