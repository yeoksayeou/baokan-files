　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 9th: Liu Jingyi, General Manager of China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC), and Chen Zhuolin, General Manager of Central Air Transport Corporation (CATC), received a warm welcome from the Central People's Government upon their defection and arrival in Beijing. Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council, Acting Chief of General Staff Nie Rongzhen of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission, Minister of Communications Zhang Bojun, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Li Kenong, and Commander of the People's Liberation Army Air Force Liu Yalou hosted a banquet tonight in their honor.
    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 9th: Liu Jingyi, General Manager of China National Aviation Corporation, and Chen Zhuolin, General Manager of Central Air Transport Corporation, as well as all employees of the two companies who revolted in Hong Kong today, issued the following telegram:

    To Chairman Mao, Vice-Chairmen Zhu, Liu, Song, Li, Zhang, Gao, and Premier Zhou of the Central People's Government:

    China National Aviation Corporation and Central Air Transport Corporation, operating transportation businesses, have always focused on serving the people and society. Since their establishment, they have been cultivated by the people's years of hard work and the united efforts of their employees, enabling them to roughly achieve their current scale. Unfortunately, the Kuomintang regime launched a civil war, and the two companies were coerced into moving their business and aviation focus away from Shanghai, wandering around with them and almost facing extinction. Recently, the Kuomintang government has repeatedly forced the two companies to move to Taiwan. The two companies are national assets and the careers of their employees, and they cannot be allowed to be destroyed. Now that the People's Liberation Army has achieved a decisive victory and the great cause of national construction is beginning, after careful consideration, we have decided to follow the companies' consistent service policy and comply with the unanimous wishes of all colleagues, to begin repatriation from today. All personnel and equipment will be gradually transported back to the country in order to plan the restoration of original business. We hereby announce that from today, we will cease navigation in the Chiang-controlled areas, sever relations with the Kuomintang regime, and submit to the People's Central Government, awaiting instructions. We are extremely urgent. We hereby report this news.

    　　　　　　Liu Jingyi, General Manager of China National Aviation Corporation

　　两公司刘陈两总经理飞抵北京受热烈欢迎
    【新华社北京九日电】中国航空公司总经理刘敬宜和中央航空公司总经理陈卓林，在起义飞达北京后，受到中央人民政府的热烈欢迎。政务院总理周恩来、人民革命军事委员会代总参谋长聂荣臻、交通部长章伯钧、外交部副部长李克农、中国人民解放军空军司令刘亚楼，于今晚设宴招待。
    【新华社北京九日电】本日在香港起义的中国航空公司总经理刘敬宜、中央航空公司总经理陈卓林及两公司全体员工发表通电如下：
    中央人民政府毛主席、朱副主席、刘副主席、宋副主席、李副主席、张副主席、高副主席、周总理钧鉴：
    中国中央两航空公司经营交通事业，向以服务社会人民为主。成立以来，经人民多年血汗培养与从业人员一致之努力，乃能粗有现在之规模。不幸国民党政权发动内战，两公司受其挟持将营业机航重心一度迁离上海，随其到处流徙，几濒绝境。而国民党政府最近复一再逼迫两公司迁往台湾，两公司乃系国家之资产，从业人员之事业，自不能任其破坏灭绝。况值解放军事业经底定，建国大业正在开始，经慎重考虑结果，决定依照公司一向服务之方针，并顺应全体同仁一致之愿望，自即日起开始复员回国，所有人员器材即将逐步运回国内，以便筹划恢复原有业务。并自即日起宣布停止通航蒋管区域，与国民党政权断绝关系，归附人民中央政府，听候指示，不胜迫切，谨此电闻。
