Xinhua News Agency, New York: According to TASS, on October 27th, the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, after concluding its discussion of the issue of rescuing Greek patriots, resumed its discussion of the Greek issue. Vyshinsky, head of the Soviet delegation, delivered a speech on the Greek issue at the meeting. Vyshinsky first pointed out that the reports of the Conciliation Committee and the so-called "Balkan Committee" must be carefully analyzed. The Conciliation Committee faced two important issues, which were the key to resolving the entire Greek issue: the territorial issue and the domestic situation in Greece.

    The US and Britain should be held responsible for the failure to resolve the Greek-Albanian border issue

    First, regarding the territorial issue, Vyshinsky said: At the Third Session of the United Nations General Assembly in Paris, one of the main obstacles to reaching an agreement between Greece (on one side) and its northern neighbors (on the other) was the border issue. Who should be held responsible for this obstacle? It would be untrue to say that Albania should be held responsible. Vyshinsky cited the words of Greek Prime Minister Tsaldaris at the Paris Peace Conference on August 3, 1946, as proof. At that time, the Athens government fabricated the existence of a state of war between Greece and Albania, saying: "The state of war existing between Albania and Greece must be brought to a natural and just end by handing over Northern Epirus to Greece," "The Greek government demands the incorporation of Northern Epirus into its territory." This was the only way the Athens government envisioned resolving Greek-Albanian relations in 1946. The same idea remains in 1949. What is this if not an impolite demand for the territory of others? Tsaldaris then mentioned the decision of the US Senate recommending the incorporation of Northern Epirus into Greece, which meant that the United States supported these predatory desires. Therefore, when the current Greek Prime Minister Diomidis declared to reporters on October 18th that Greece could not, under any circumstances, relinquish its rights to Northern Epirus, the Conciliation Committee found it truly difficult to complete its work.
    Vyshinsky said that the Soviet Union had put forward a simple, clear, and peaceful plan, one point of which was: "The governments of Albania and Greece recognize the existing border between Albania and Greece as the final border." This was precisely what the Athens government and its protectors were unwilling to record. So the Conciliation Committee proposed other choices to replace it, which essentially expressed the old attitude of the Athens government in maintaining its territorial claims on Albania. The Athens government disagreed with accepting the existing border as the final border, and instead talked about agreeing not to use force or the threat of force "to change the border between Albania and Greece." Predatory plans can also be implemented through so-called peaceful means, such as blockade, economic pressure, etc. The question is to abandon the idea of changing the border. But the US and British representatives said this was impossible. The US and other representatives believe that unchanged national borders are an ancient doctrine. Yes, this is a very old doctrine, but it is linked to the principles of true independence and true territorial integrity. The Athens government is not ashamed of its openly declared territorial claims on Albania, and this position has been supported by the United States and Britain. The Athens government is merely a puppet, a toy, in the hands of foreign protectors. The American and British reactionary groups standing behind the Athens government have, for many years, especially in recent years, proved to be a group that has been vigorously protecting the predatory desires of the Athens government.
    Vyshinsky pointed out: If the UN General Assembly's resolution on establishing diplomatic relations between Albania and Greece has not been fulfilled, the fault lies with the Athens government, because it is unwilling to give up its predatory ambitions towards Albania and some other neighboring countries. Vyshinsky emphasized that the Athens government is executing the will of the American ruling clique, so the responsibility for failing to reach an agreement in the Conciliation Committee "should primarily be borne by the United States, which has been the main organizer of the entire chaos and adventure in Greece that has always attracted widespread attention around the world for many years. The responsibility, of course, is borne by the United States and Britain."

    Adopting Soviet proposals is the only way to normalize the situation in Greece
    The second issue is the domestic situation in Greece. Vyshinsky said: "The Soviet Union's proposal of May 20th of this year is entirely suitable for resolving the issue of the domestic situation in Greece." Vyshinsky cited materials from the "Balkan Committee" report to prove that the domestic situation in Greece is organically linked to the issue of Greece's diplomatic relations with its northern neighbors. He said: "We in the Soviet Union have repeatedly drawn everyone's attention to the fact that the main reason for this situation arising in Greece and its borders is the struggle between the Greek people and the anti-democratic reactionary forces, which have gathered around the government supported by the American and British reactionary forces." Vyshinsky cited materials from the General Staff of the Athens government to illustrate the situation in Greece. The communiqué of the General Staff of the Athens government on September 24th stated: "Throughout the country, the army and the gendarmerie continue to operate to fully restore the authority of the state." From this, it can be seen that there is no state authority in the country, and it is "being restored." The General Staff also mentioned that small battles are taking place throughout the country. Vyshinsky pointed out that the normalization of the domestic situation in Greece can be achieved through several measures proposed in the Soviet proposal. "These measures start with the announcement of an amnesty, stipulate that democratic elections be held under the control of a supreme body that includes representatives of Greek democrats who lead the people's liberation movement, and that delegations from various countries, including the Soviet Union, supervise the elections." Vyshinsky said: "I think it is necessary to organize a joint committee with the participation of the Soviet Union to control the border situation between Greece and its neighbors. But the Conciliation Committee considered it impossible to adopt these Soviet proposals."
    Vyshinsky concluded that the Soviet proposals must be adopted to make a genuine solution to the so-called Greek issue possible. (Attached picture)

### 维辛斯基在联大政委会发表关于希腊问题演说

　　维辛斯基在联大政委会
    发表关于希腊问题演说
    【新华社北京三日电】据塔斯社纽约讯：十月二十七日，联合国大会政治委员会在结束讨论拯救希腊爱国者问题之后，恢复讨论希腊问题，苏联代表团团长维辛斯基在会上发表关于希腊问题的演说。维辛斯基首先指出，必须认真地分析调解委员会和所谓“巴尔干委员会”的报告。调解委员会面对着作为解决全部希腊问题的锁钥的两个重要的问题：领土问题和希腊国内情况问题。
　　希阿疆界问题不能解决应由美英负责
    首先，关于领土问题，维辛斯基说：在巴黎联大第三届会议上，成为希腊（一方）及其北邻（另一方）之间获致协议的主要障碍之一，正是边境问题。谁应对这种障碍负责呢？如果说应由阿尔巴尼亚负责，这是不合事实的。维辛斯基举出了一九四六年八月三日巴黎和会上雅典政府总理曹达利斯的话来证明。当时，雅典政府捏造说，希阿之间存在着战争状态，它说：“阿尔巴尼亚与希腊之间存在着的战争状态必须以奉送艾匹鲁斯北部给希腊来达到自然而公正的结束”，“希腊政府要求把艾匹鲁斯北部并入本国版图”。这是雅典政府在一九四六年所设想的解决希阿关系问题的唯一办法。在一九四九年还是这样设想。这如果不是不客气地要求别人的领土又是什么呢？当时曹达利斯曾提到美国参院的建议把艾匹鲁斯北部并入希腊的决定，那就是说，美国支持这些掠夺性的愿望。因此，当现任雅典政府总理狄奥米第斯在十月十八日对记者发表声明，说希腊无论如何不能放弃对艾匹鲁斯北部的权利的时候，调解委员会诚然是难以完成它的工作的。
    维辛斯基说，苏联曾提出了一个简单、明确而和平的方案，其中一点就是：“阿尔巴尼亚及希腊政府承认阿尔巴尼亚及希腊之间现存的疆界，是最后的疆界”。这正是雅典政府及其庇护人所不愿记录下来的。所以调解委员会提出别的抉择来代替它，这种抉择本质上是表现雅典政府保持着对阿尔巴尼亚领土要求的老态度。雅典政府不同意接受现存的疆界是最后的疆界这一点，而侈谈什么同意不使用武力或武力的威胁，“以改变阿尔巴尼亚与希腊的疆界”。掠夺性的计划是也可以用所谓和平的手段，如封锁、经济压力等等来实行的。问题是在于放弃改变边界的念头。但美英代表说这是不可能的。美国等代表认为国界不变，这是一种古老的学说。是的，这是很古老的学说，但它与真正独立、真正领土完整的原则有联系。雅典政府是并不为其公开声言对阿尔巴尼亚的领土要求而感到羞惭的，这种立场得到了美英两国的支持。雅典政府只是外国保护者手上的傀儡、玩具。站在雅典政府背后的美英反动集团，许多年来，特别是最近几年来，已经证明其为极力庇护雅典政府之掠夺愿望的集团。
    维辛斯基指出：如果联大关于建立阿希之间外交关系的决议没有履行的话，这种事的过错也在于雅典政府方面，因为它不愿意放弃它对于阿尔巴尼亚和某些其他邻国的掠夺性的贪图。维辛斯基着重指出：雅典政府所执行的是美国统治集团的意志，所以，在调解委员会中不能达成协议的责任，“首先要由美国担负，它是多年来那种一向引起全世界普遍注意的发生在希腊的整个混乱局面和整个冒险行动的主要组织者。责任当然是由美国和英国担负”。
　　采取苏联建议才能使希腊情势正常化
    第二个问题是希腊国内情势问题。维辛斯基说：“苏联本年五月二十日的建议是完全适宜于解决希腊国内情势问题的”。维辛斯基引据“巴尔干委员会”报告的材料，证明希腊国内形势是和希腊与其北部邻国外交关系的问题，有着有机联系的。他说：“我们苏联不只一次地要大家注意这种事实，即在希腊国内和其边境所产生的这种形势的主要原因，乃是希腊人民与反民主的反动力量之间的斗争，这个反动力量已集拢在美英反动力量所支持的政府的周围。”维辛斯基引证雅典政府总参谋部的材料来说明希腊的形势。雅典政府总参谋部九月二十四日的公报说：“在全国各地，陆军与宪兵继续活动，以完全恢复国家的威权”。由此可见，全国都没有国家的威权，它“正在恢复中”。总参谋部还提到小战斗正在全国各地进行。维辛斯基指出，希腊国内形势的正常化，可由苏联建议中所提出的若干措施求得实现。“这些措施就是以宣布大赦为开始，规定在容纳有领导人民解放运动的希腊民主人士之代表在内的一个最高机关的控制下，举行民主选举，并由包括苏联在内的各国代表团对选举实行监督”。维辛斯基说：“我认为有必要组织一个有苏联参加的联合委员会，以控制希腊与其邻国之间的边界状况。但是调解委员会认为不可能采纳苏联的这些建议。”
    维辛基斯的结论说：必须采纳苏联的建议，使所谓希腊问题的真正解决成为可能。（附图片）
