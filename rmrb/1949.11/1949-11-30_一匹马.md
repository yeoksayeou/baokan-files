　　A Horse
　　Jiali
　　June 15, 1949.
　　In the morning, the sun rose from the east, piercing through the gaps in the leaves, shining directly onto the railway. Adjacent to the railway was a wide highway, and on this day, a unit of the 19th Army Corps was passing through the Jiexiu area. During the march, due to the carelessness of the groom, a black horse suddenly bolted. It ran along the railway and the highway—its nostrils puffing, white foam dripping from its mouth, kicking up clouds of dust.
　　Early in the morning, there were few pedestrians on the road, but on the railway, the clang of work had been ringing out early. Liang Shuzheng and Tian Yonglong, track workers from the Jiexiu Engineering Section of the Tongpu Railway, had already begun repairing the line at the "488" kilometer marker east of the Dashi River Bridge.
　　Since the railway truly became the people's own, the workers' enthusiasm and work efficiency have been astonishing. Picks and shovels struck ceaselessly; they had only one desire—to repair the line well, to support the war to liberate the Great Northwest.
　　The black horse was coming! Having broken free and lost its saddle, it (the horse) headed southwest, running blindly along the railway and highway. When the horse saw the group of people wielding bright, gleaming road repair tools, it mistakenly thought they were blocking its way and panicked, turning north to run. This was seen by worker Liang Shuzheng, who shielded his forehead with his hand and quickly said to everyone:
　　"Comrades—look quickly, whose big horse is that?"
　　"Ha... ha... It's lost its saddle! A fast fellow..." The workers all stopped what they were doing and looked north. Wang Qingming then reminded everyone:
　　"Troops have been passing through these past two days, the unit must be behind it, the horse must have bolted. There's no doubt the horse belongs to our own people. Hurry up and chase after it, don't let it run too far!" This one sentence reminded everyone. Liang Shuzheng was the first to run down from the roadbed, followed closely by Liu Lailiang and Tian Yonglong, chasing and shouting as they ran!
　　Half an hour later, the black horse ran to the Fen River. The yellow water flowed rapidly. It didn't dare jump in, so it turned back and ran towards Duantun Village. Before long, Liang Shuzheng also reached the bank of the Fen River. Seeing the hoof prints heading west, he also ran towards Duantun.
　　As it approached the village, the horse slowed to a trot. The pursuers did not slow down. Before long, they caught up, spreading out in a skirmish line, then slowly closing in again, then moving forward rapidly, and Liang Shuzheng grabbed the reins. The horse stubbornly neighed "Hiss... hiss..." but soon calmed down. By this time, it was eleven o'clock.
　　At noon, when the seemingly endless column of troops entered the Tongpu Railway Station in Jiexiu City, Liang Shuzheng and Tian Yonglong led the black horse. They welcomed them by the roadside, calling out:
　　"Is this your horse? Take it away! Take it away!" At this time, a commander holding a "Liberate the Great Northwest" banner rushed forward, shook hands with the workers, and then gave a cordial, enthusiastic salute.

　　一匹马
    加里
    一九四九年六月十五日。
    早上，太阳从东方升起来，穿过树叶的罅隙，把阳光直射到铁路上，紧挨着铁道的是宽阔公路线，十九兵团某部这天正从介休地区通过。行军间，因马夫不小心，把一匹乌骓大马突然惊逃了，它，沿着铁路、公路线奔跑——鼻子喷着气，嘴角流下白沫，尘土滚滚。
    清晨，路上行人还很少，可是铁道上老早叮当叮当工作响，同蒲路介休工务段道板工人梁书政、田永龙他们已经在大石河桥东“四八八”公里处开始整修线路。
    铁路——自真正成为人民自己的以后，工人们的热情与工作效率是非常惊人的，洋镐、铁锹不停敲打，人家只有一个愿望——把线路修好，好支援解放大西北的战争。
    乌骓马来了！脱缰、转鞍了的它（马），指向西南方，顺着铁路、公路盲目地奔来。当马看见高举明晃晃修路家具的一伙人时，误认为是挡自己的，就惊慌地扭向北方跑去；这却被工人梁书政看见，他用手遮住前额，急忙对大家说：
    “伙伴们——快瞧，那是谁家的大马呀？”
    “呵…呵…转鞍了！飞快的家伙……”工人们都停住手，一齐向北面眺望，王清明这时提醒大伙说：
    “这两天过队伍，一定是部队在后面，马先惊脱了，没问题马是自己人的，赶快撵上去，可不要教跑远了！”一句话提醒大家，梁书政第一个从路基上跑下来，刘来亮、田永龙他们紧跟着，追上去，吆喊着，奔跑着！
    半点钟过后，乌骓马跑到汾河边，黄色的水，湍急地流着，它不敢跳下去，于是折转回来，向段屯村跑，不多会，梁书政也赶到汾河岸边，一见蹄印奔向西去，也就向段屯跑来。
    接近村庄时，马跑成碎步子，慢下来。追的人并没有跑慢，不一会就追上了，散兵线式地散开，又慢慢全拢上去，然后急步向前，梁书政扯住缰绳。马顽皮地还在“嘶…嘶…”鸣叫，但不多时也就驯服了。这时，时间已是十一点。
    正午当“一斧子砍不断”（很长意）的队伍进到介休城同蒲车站时，梁书政、田永龙牵着乌骓大马。在路旁欢迎，并招呼着说：
    “这是咱们的马吧？快拉去！快拉去！”这时一个手持“解放大西北”锦旗的指挥员，飞步向前，和工人们握手，接着来了一个亲切、热烈的敬礼。
