　　Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 17th. Following the uprising of all employees of the China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) and Central Air Transport Corporation (CATC), the employees of the pseudo-Resource Committee stationed in Hong Kong also announced their secession from the Kuomintang reactionary remnant government on the 13th of this month. On the 6th of this month, Liu Hangchen, the pseudo-Minister of Economic Affairs and concurrently Chairman of the Resource Committee, flew from Chongqing to Hong Kong and conspired with Fang Chongsen, the director of the Foreign Trade Office under the committee, to embezzle and sell mineral products and equipment stored in Hong Kong. After several days of secret planning, Liu summoned key staff members of the office on the 11th and declared that all mineral products stored in Hong Kong would be cleared out within a few days and handed over to him for personal disposal. He also stated that the office would be closed and all staff dismissed after the mineral products were cleared. After learning of this, the employees of the office, believing that the assets of the office belonged to the motherland and that they had a sacred responsibility to do their utmost to protect them, and inspired by the recent uprising of all employees of CNAC and CATC, held a general staff meeting on the 13th. They unanimously resolved to secede from the Kuomintang reactionary remnant government, refuse to accept any pseudo-orders, do their best to protect the assets stored in Hong Kong, await reception by the People's Government, and immediately telegram the Central People's Government for instructions. At the same time, they issued a declaration calling on all sectors of society for support. Thirty-five employees of the Foreign Trade Office of the Trade Department of the pseudo-Resource Committee stationed in Hong Kong participated in this action, accounting for the vast majority of the total of forty-one personnel, with only the pseudo-director of the office, Fang Chongsen, and his five cronies not participating.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 17th. The employees of the pseudo-Resource Committee stationed in Hong Kong telegraphed the Central People's Government, announcing their secession from the Kuomintang reactionary remnant, protecting the assets left in Hong Kong, and awaiting reception by the People's Government. The telegram reads as follows:

    To Chairman Mao, Vice-Chairman Zhu, Vice-Chairman Liu, Vice-Chairman Song, Vice-Chairman Li, Vice-Chairman Zhang, Vice-Chairman Gao, and Premier Zhou of the Central People's Government:

    We participated in the work of the Resource Committee, handling the export of mineral products, with the aim of serving the people and promoting national production. Since the Kuomintang reactionaries launched the civil war and carried out frenzied destruction, our work has been affected and completely violated our original intentions.

    Recently, the reactionary bureaucrats, under the great pressure of the People's Liberation Army, have reached the end of their road, and are still using their consistent methods of corruption and malfeasance to plunder the assets left in Hong Kong in order to line their own pockets. We are truly heartbroken and cannot bear to stand idly by in the face of this base action that violates the interests of the people.

    We believe that we are working for the country and the people, and that the assets we manage are the assets of the country and the people. Today, the people of the whole country have overthrown the reactionary and dark rule and embarked on a bright construction. We, all colleagues, are willing to work hard for our new country and use these assets belonging to the country and the people in future construction. We will never allow the greedy and inferior people to succeed in their tricks of embezzlement and plunder. We have decided to sever relations with the Kuomintang reactionary regime from today, and will not accept any chaotic orders from the reactionary corrupt officials. We will unanimously stick to our posts to protect the assets for the people and await reception by the People's Government. We hereby send this telegram, awaiting instructions with utmost urgency. Wu Zhixiang, Gong Jialin, Liang @, Li Xinmin, Feng Ribin, Lin Aiyuan, Meng Songnan, and 35 other employees of the Hong Kong Trade Office of the Foreign Trade Office of the Resource Committee, November 14th.

    【新华社广州十七日电】在中航、央航两公司全体员工起义影响下，伪资源委员会驻香港员工亦于本月十三日宣布脱离国民党反动残余政府。本月六日，伪经济部长兼资源委员会主任委员刘航琛自渝飞港，与该会所属国外贸易事务所所长方崇森阴谋将存港矿品及器材侵吞盗卖。经数日密谋后，刘匪于十一日召集该所重要职员谈话，宣称在三数日内将存港矿品全部出清，交彼个人处理，并于矿品出清后结束该所，遣散全部职员。该所员工知悉此项谈话后，以该所资财既属祖国财产，他们有尽力保护的神圣责任，更受最近中航、央航两公司全体员工起义的鼓舞，遂于十三日举行全体员工大会，一致决议脱离国民党反动残余政府，拒绝接受一切伪命，尽力保护存港资产，静候人民政府接收，并即致电中央人民政府，听候指示，同时发出宣言，吁请社会各界支援。参加此次行动的为伪资源委员会贸易处国外贸易事务所驻港员工共三十五人，占全部人员四十一人之绝大多数，仅该所伪所长方崇森及其亲信五人未参加。
    【新华社广州十七日电】伪资源委员会驻港员工致电中央人民政府，宣布脱离国民党反动残余，保护留港资产，听候人民政府接收。电文如下：
    中央人民政府毛主席、朱副主席、刘副主席、宋副主席、李副主席、张副主席、高副主席、周总理钧鉴：
    我们参加资源委员会工作，办理出口矿品业务，目的在为人民服务，促进国家生产，自从国民党反动派发动内战，疯狂破坏，使我们的工作受了打击，与我们的目的完全违背。
    最近反动官僚在人民解放军的伟大压力下穷途末路，犹用其一贯贪污舞弊的手法，掠夺留港的资产，以饱私囊。我们对于这种违反人民利益的卑污行动，实在痛心疾首，不忍坐视。
    我们认定我们是为国家人民而工作，我们经管的资产是国家人民的资产。今天全国人民推翻了反动黑暗的统治，展开了光明的建设，我们全体同人愿为我们的新国家努力，并使这些属于国家人民的资产用在今后的建设上，决不使贪劣之徒得遂其侵吞掠夺的诡计。我们决定从今天起与国民党反动政权脱离关系，不受反动贪官的任何乱命，一致坚守岗位，为人民保护资产，听候人民政府接收。谨此电达，伫候指示，不胜迫切之至。资源委员会香港贸易处国外贸易事务所员工吴志翔、龚家麟、梁＠、李新民、冯日宾、林艾园、孟颂南等三十五人十一月十四日
