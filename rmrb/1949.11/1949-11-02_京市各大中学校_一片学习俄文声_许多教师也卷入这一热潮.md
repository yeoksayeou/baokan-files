　　Major Universities and Middle Schools in Beijing
  　A Wave of Russian Language Learning Sweeps
    Many Teachers Join the Craze
    [Our Newspaper's Report] Following the campaign to sign up for the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, teachers and students in major universities and middle schools in Beijing are now immersed in a wave of learning Russian. Peking University, Tsinghua University, and Normal University have all added Russian elective courses. China University organized a "Russian Language Grand Corps" of more than 500 people in September. Jiaotong University's Beijing Management Institute established a two-year Russian language specialty program. Middle schools have also designated Russian as a required course for the first year of junior high school. The enthusiasm for learning is generally high. In the Sand灘 area of Peking University, 200 people have signed up for the Russian elective course. During each lecture, many students, faculty, staff, public security personnel, as well as cadres from outside institutions and professional women, rush to audit the class. Under the direct leadership of professors such as Cao Jinghua and Wu Qingyou, the Russian language group of the Department of Western Languages ​​has students voluntarily requesting to study for eleven hours a week. When Tsinghua University was hiring professors, it originally planned to have only two Russian classes (80 people), but more than 500 people (divided into nine classes) signed up. In this Russian learning campaign, some lecturers, teaching assistants, and middle school faculty members are studying together with the students. Teachers and students all regard learning and teaching Russian as a political task to be completed. Professor Wei Zhen, who teaches Russian at Jiaotong University's Beijing Institute, set out the teaching principles before starting teaching. He said: "The task is arduous, but every professor who teaches Russian has a high degree of teaching enthusiasm. We are willing to put our entire mind and energy into this cause and resolutely implement the 'responsibility system' in teaching." The Russian language specialty program of the institute plans to focus on basic language training in the first year, so that students can read simple Russian, know a little about translation, and be able to speak some common phrases. In the second year, the focus will be on training in the translation of transportation technology. The common slogan of the teachers and students of Jiaotong University is: "Strive to cultivate a large number of compilation and translation personnel for the people's railways and learn from the Soviet Union's nation-building experience." Before starting to learn Russian, schools such as the Mongolian-Tibetan School, Beijing Normal School, and Municipal No. 2 Middle School conducted ideological education through group discussions, forums, wall newspapers, and teachers' explanations to help students establish a correct understanding of learning from the Soviet Union and recognize that learning Russian is a powerful tool for obtaining Soviet nation-building experience.

　　京市各大中学校
  　一片学习俄文声
    许多教师也卷入这一热潮
    【本报讯】京市各大、中学师生，继签名参加中苏友好协会运动之后，目前又投入学习俄文的热潮中。北大、清华、师大都增设了俄文选修科，华大从九月便组织了五百多人的“俄文大队”，交大北京管理学院成立了二年制俄文专修科；中学里也都把俄文定为初一的必修课程。大家学习的情绪普遍高涨，北大沙滩区选修俄文的有二百人，在每次讲课时，还有很多的同学、教职员、工警以及校外的机关干部、职业妇女赶来旁听；西语系的俄文组在曹靖华，吴清友等教授直接领导下，同学们都自动要求每星期学习十一个钟头。清华在聘教授时，本来只准备有两个俄文班（八十人），结果报名参加的却有五百多人（分成九班）。在这次学习俄文运动中，一些讲师，助教和中学教职员，都和同学们一块学习。师生们都把学俄文和教俄文当做了一个政治任务来完成，交大京院教俄文的魏真教授在开始教学前订出了教学方针，他说：“任务是很艰巨的，但我们每一位教俄文的教授都具有很高的教学热情，我们愿将整个的心力放在这一事业上，坚决地贯澈教导上的‘负责制’。”该院的俄文专修科计划在第一年着重基本语文的训练，使同学能阅读粗浅的俄文，略知翻译并能讲一些普通话；第二年着重训练交通技术的翻译。交大的师生们的共同的口号是：“为人民铁路培养大批编译人员，学习苏联建国经验而奋斗”。蒙藏学校、北京师范、市立二中等校，在开始学习俄文之前，通过小组讨论、座谈会、壁报和教师的讲解启发进行思想教育，使同学们树立学习苏联的正确观念，认清学习俄文是取得苏联建国经验的有力工具。（北大、清华、华大、师大、北师、二中、交大京院、通讯组陈钧、萧森等）
