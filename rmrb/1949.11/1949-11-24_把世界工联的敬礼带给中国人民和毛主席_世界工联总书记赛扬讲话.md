Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 23rd: The following is the full text of the speech by Louis Saillant, General Secretary of the World Federation of Trade Unions, at the Beijing People's Congress celebrating the success of the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference today:

    Dear comrades: I now bring you the greetings of the World Federation of Trade Unions. I salute the working class of Beijing, I salute all the leaders of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, I salute the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, I salute the national flag of the People's Republic of China, and finally, in this great palace, I salute Chairman Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese people!

    We have held the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference in Beijing for a week. This Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference will have a significant impact on the future of Asian and Australian workers and the labor movement. We know the true power that this conference represents, which is related to the fate and lives of hundreds of millions of workers, and it is a symbol of the independence and autonomy of the people of Asian and Australian countries. No force can stop them from moving forward, and no force can stop the people from demanding their liberation and freedom. Our conference calls for the unity of the working classes of all countries and the strengthening of the labor movements of all countries. This call can be heard by people all over the world.

    The Japanese representatives could not attend this conference because MacArthur, the ruler of the U.S. imperialists in Japan, would not allow the Japanese delegation to leave Tokyo. But can he stop the unity between the Japanese working class and us? Of course not. We say that we have the ability and the means to respond to the U.S. imperialists. The World Federation of Trade Unions includes trade union members from all countries and is connected with progressive trade unions in all countries. In other words, the World Federation of Trade Unions is not isolated. Throughout the world, the forces of progress, peace, democracy, and opposition to imperialism are strong. Because it represents the interests of the people and fights against those who oppose the interests of the people. Our great strength lies in the powerful combination of workers, women, youth, and all people's forces around the world. There is also the strong and solid fortress of the Soviet socialist country. There are also many people's democratic countries, especially the newest and most important, our People's Republic of China.

    Long live the unity of the people's forces of the world in the struggle against imperialism and in defense of peace!

    Long live the great unity of the workers of all countries in the world!

    For the victory of the proletarian struggle throughout the world, we should strengthen our unity!

　　把世界工联的敬礼带给中国人民和毛主席
    世界工联总书记赛扬讲话
    【新华社北京二十三日电】世界工会联合会总书记赛扬，今日在北京市各界人民庆祝亚洲澳洲工会会议成功大会上的讲话全文如下：
    亲爱的同志们：我现在把世界工联的敬礼带给你们。我向北京市工人阶级致敬，我向所有中华全国总工会的领袖致敬，我向中华全国总工会致敬，我向中华人民共和国的国旗致敬，最后我在这伟大的皇宫里向中国人民领袖毛泽东主席致敬！
    我们在北京举行亚洲澳洲工会会议已一星期了。这次亚澳工会会议对未来的亚澳工人及工人运动将有重大影响。我们知道这次大会代表着的真正力量，这是关系着数以万万计的工人的命运和他们的生活的，这是亚澳各国人民独立自主的象征。没有任何力量可以阻止他们前进，没有任何力量可以阻止人民要求自己的解放和自由。我们大会号召各国工人阶级团结，各国工人运动加强。这个号召是全世界人民都可以听到的。
    这次大会日本代表不能来参加，是由于美帝国主义者在日本的统治者麦克阿瑟不让日本代表团离开东京。但，是不是他能阻止日本工人阶级和我们的团结呢？自然不能的。我们说，我们对于美帝国主义者是有能力，有方法回答的。世界工联包括着各国工会会员，对于各国的进步工会都是有联系的，换言之，世界工联不是孤立的。在全世界上，进步力量，和平、民主、反对帝国主义的力量是强大的。因为它代表着人民的利益、向反人民利益者作斗争。我们伟大的力量，在于全世界工人、妇女、青年及所有人民力量的强大的结合。还有苏联社会主义国家这个强大坚固的堡垒。还有许多人民民主国家，特别是最新的而最重要的，就是我们的中华人民共和国。
    全世界人民力量团结起来为反对帝国主义保卫和平斗争万岁！
    全世界各国工人大团结万岁！
    为了全世界无产阶级的斗争胜利，我们应该加强团结起来！
