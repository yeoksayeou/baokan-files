Beijing Municipal Trade Union Preparatory Committee Director Xiao Ming Broadcasts
Welcome to Asian-Australasian Trade Union Conference Held in Beijing
Calls on Beijing Workers to Learn from International Labor Movement Leaders

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] "We, the city's workers, warmly welcome the World Federation of Trade Unions Executive Bureau meeting and the Asian-Australasian Trade Union Conference to be held in Beijing." Xiao Ming, director of the Beijing Municipal Trade Union Preparatory Committee, delivered a speech on the second station of the Beijing Xinhua Broadcasting Station on the 14th with this title. He said: "Holding such a meeting in Beijing is a first in history. This is an honor for our Chinese working class and the broad masses of the Chinese people, especially for our Beijing working class and the broad masses of the people! Our Chinese working class, especially the workers of Beijing, must, in the spirit of the traditional internationalism of our Chinese working class, warmly welcome and celebrate the convening of these two meetings in Beijing."

He told the workers of Beijing that the overall goal of this meeting is: to oppose imperialism, to oppose feudalism, to oppose wars of aggression, to oppose splitters of the world labor movement, to defend lasting world peace, to strive for national independence of oppressed countries, to defend the democratic rights of trade unions, and to defend the unity of the world labor movement, and through this meeting to exchange experiences of workers' movements in various countries, to exchange important experiences of the working class in liberated countries in the workers' movement and in production and construction. This meeting is not only a meeting of great unity of the Asian-Australasian working class, but also a meeting of solidarity between the Asian-Australasian people and the people of the world to defend peace. This is the most valuable opportunity for our Chinese workers, especially Beijing workers, to receive proletarian internationalist education. While excited and rejoicing, we must learn from the leaders and organizers of the international workers' movement with great humility and great enthusiasm. First of all, we must learn from the Soviet working class, learn their great internationalist spirit, and learn their fighting spirit and valuable experience in revolutionary struggle and production construction. We must give full play to the fine traditions of bravery and diligence of the Chinese people, especially the Chinese working class, to build our new Beijing and new China, and celebrate the success of these two meetings with our own great achievements in production and construction and strive for greater achievements in trade union work.

    京市总工会筹委会主任萧明广播
    欢迎亚澳工会会议在京召开
    号召京市工人向国际工运领导者学习
    【本报讯】“我们全市工人热烈欢迎世界工联执行局会议和亚澳工会会议在京召开”。北京市总工会筹委会主任萧明十四日在北京新华广播电台第二台作了这个题目的讲演。他说：“在北京召开这样的会议，在历史上是第一次。这是我们中国工人阶级和中国广大人民的光荣，特别是我们北京市工人阶级和广大人民的光荣！我们中国工人阶级，特别是我们北京市的工人们要本着我们中国工人阶级传统的国际主义精神，热烈欢迎并庆祝这两个会议在北京召开。”
    他告诉北京市工人这次会议的总目标是：反对帝国主义、反对封建主义、反对侵略战争、反对世界工人运动的分裂者、为保卫世界持久和平、争取被压迫国家的民族独立、捍卫工会民主权利、捍卫世界工人运动的统一，并且通过这个会议交换各国工人运动的经验，交流已解放国家的工人阶级在工人运动上的、在生产建设上的重要经验。这个会议不仅是亚澳工人阶级大团结的会议，而且是亚澳人民与世界人民团结一致保卫和平的会议。这是我们中国工人，尤其是北京工人受无产阶级国际主义教育最难得的机会，我们在兴奋欢欣之余，要以极大的虚心、极大的热情向国际工人运动的领导者和组织者学习。首先是向苏联的工人阶级学习，学习他们的伟大的国际主义精神，学习他们在革命斗争与生产建设中的奋斗精神与宝贵经验。我们要充分发挥我们中国人民尤其是中国工人阶级的勇敢而勤劳的优良传统来建设我们的新北京和新中国，用我们自己在生产建设上的伟大成就和争取工会工作更大的成绩来庆祝这两个会议的成功。
