　　Traffic Order Must Be Strictly Observed
    Liu Menghua
    A few days ago, I saw three police comrades checking bicycles at an intersection. A young man in his twenties came over. His bike didn't have a bell. When the comrades asked him about it, he retorted "righteously" saying, "I've wanted to install one for a long time, but what can I do if I don't have the money? Don't you think I'd want to have a bell? At least it would save me from wasting time talking to you!" The comrades weren't angry and patiently explained the importance of revolutionary order and traffic safety to him, trying to persuade and educate him.
    This matter seems small, but it aroused endless feelings in me. In the past, during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, traffic accidents occurred frequently. American trucks rushed recklessly through the streets. Although there was a traffic safety week at that time, stipulating that vehicles should have lights and bells, it was just empty words. Those who disrupted traffic order were still their own people, and those who suffered were ordinary citizens.
    In the past, the Kuomintang reactionaries didn't care about the people, neglected traffic safety, and caused the unjust deaths of many people. But today's Beijing is the people's Beijing. The People's Government, for the safety and interests of the majority of the people, has made correct regulations regarding traffic safety. We should enthusiastically support them without any objection and must not use the kind of erroneous views of the past to treat the government's regulations today. We must know that this is harmful to revolutionary traffic order.

　　交通秩序应严格遵守
    刘梦华
    前几天在街口上见到有三个人民警察同志正在检查自行车，一位二十几岁的年青人走过来，车上没铃，当同志们问他的时候，他反而“理直气壮”的说：“我早就想装上，但是我没有钱怎么办呢？难道我还不愿意有个铃好吗，有了铃至少省了跟您们费话。”同志们听了并不生气，很耐心的对他解释革命秩序与交通安全的重要，进行说服教育。
    这一件事看起来很小，在我却引起了无限的感想，过去国民党反动统治时期，车祸层出不绝，美国的卡车在大街上横冲直撞，虽然当时也曾有过交通安全周，规定车上要有灯有铃，但只不过是一纸空文，破坏交通秩序的还是他们自己这一帮人，受害的还是一般市民。
    过去国民党反动派没把人民放在眼里，忽视交通安全，屈死了多少人民，可是今天的北京已是人民的北京了，人民政府为了大多数人民的安全利益，有了关于交通安全的正确规定，我们应当毫无异议的热烈拥护，决不能再用过去那种错误的看法，来对待今天政府的规定，要知道这样是对革命的交通秩序有害的。
