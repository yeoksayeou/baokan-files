Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 30th. The Xinjiang delegation to the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), including Saifudin, Alimujiang, and Tu Zhi, arrived in Lanzhou at 2 PM on the 24th of this month from Beijing. They continued west from Lanzhou on the 25th. When the delegation arrived in Lanzhou, Zhang Zongxun, Director of the Military Control Commission, Zhang De＠, Secretary of the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and Ismail, an elderly Uygur from Xinjiang living in Lanzhou, went to welcome them. Saifudin, the head of the delegation, said: "This Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is the first great unity of all ethnic groups in the history of China. In the past, some people regarded the liberation movement of the people of Xinjiang as 'an action by ethnic minorities in Xinjiang against the Han people.' This is not correct. What the ethnic minorities in Xinjiang opposed was only the reactionary rulers who oppressed the people of Xinjiang (including the Han people), not the Han people. The warm welcome of the People's Liberation Army's entry into Xinjiang by the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang is proof of this. Similarly, we resolutely oppose those members of the ethnic minorities in Xinjiang who collude with reactionary rulers." He also said that the delegation must bring the resolutions of this CPPCC and the spirit of the conference to the people of Xinjiang and implement them. When they left Beijing, Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and the leaders of the Central People's Government at all levels encouraged them to unite the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang and work hard to build a new Xinjiang. They guaranteed that they would do so after returning.

　　政协新疆代表团赛福鼎等过兰返新
    【新华社兰州三十日电】赴京出席中国人民政治协商会议的新疆代表团赛福鼎、阿利木江、涂治等，于本月廿四日下午二时，由北京抵兰州。二十五日续由兰州西行。代表团抵兰时，军管会张宗逊主任、中共甘肃省委书记张德＠、新疆旅兰维族老人伊斯马伊等均曾前往欢迎。代表团团长赛福鼎说：这次中国人民政协会议，是中国历史上第一次全国各民族的大团结。过去有些人把新疆人民的解放运动看为“新疆少数民族反对汉人的行动”，这是不对的。新疆少数民族所反对的也只是压迫新疆人民（包括汉族人民）的反动统治者，而不是反对汉族人民。这次人民解放军进军新疆，受到新疆各族人民的热烈欢迎，便是证明。同样，新疆少数民族中，勾结反动统治者的人，我们一样坚决反对。他又说，代表团一定要把这次政协决议和大会精神，带给新疆人民，并贯彻实行。他们在离开北京时，毛主席、朱总司令及中央人民政府各级首长，都以团结新疆各族人民，努力建设新新疆为勉，他们回去后保证要作到。
