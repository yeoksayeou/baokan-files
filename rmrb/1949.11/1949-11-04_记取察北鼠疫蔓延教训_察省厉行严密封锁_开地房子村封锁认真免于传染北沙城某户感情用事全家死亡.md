Remember the Lessons of the Rat Plague Spread in Chahar Province
　　Chahar Province Strictly Implements Strict Blockades
    The Serious Blockade of Kaidi Fangzi Village Prevents Transmission; In Beishacheng, One Household Acted Emotionally, Resulting in the Death of the Entire Family
    [Our Newspaper Zhangjiakou Dispatch, 3rd] It has been definitively proven that the rat plague in northern Chahar came from Inner Mongolia. According to the Northern Chahar Anti-Epidemic Headquarters' news from the past two days: in the villages of Nanjingu, Lizhandi, Kangbali, and Beishacheng in Kangbao County, a total of twelve people have died from the rat plague, five of whom died from bringing the plague back from the grasslands of Inner Mongolia. The outbreak of the rat plague in Beishacheng Village was due to the fact that a daughter of a certain household in the village married into the village of Chahan Bengbeng (an epidemic area) in Inner Mongolia. The daughter fled from Chahan Bengbeng to Beishacheng to avoid the rat plague. After the village prohibited her from entering, her mother, showing affection for her daughter, insisted on going out of the village to see her off, resulting in bringing back the plague bacteria. Within a few days, all seven members of the family died one after another. Kaidi Fangzi Village, because it implemented the order of "ruthless strict blockade," refused a woman from Chahan Bengbeng who wanted to take refuge in the village (this woman soon died outside the village), and the village was not infected. The lessons and experiences of the above two villages are worth remembering well by all localities. There have also been outbreaks in Baoyuan and Duolun. In Duolun, four people returned from the grasslands of Inner Mongolia in Shuangpengzi Village. Two died on the way, and the other two fell ill after returning to the village. Zhang Guangchuan, a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner in the urban area of Baoyuan, went to Wuzhijia Village in Inner Mongolia to practice medicine. He returned home on October 6th, fell ill on the 8th, and died on the 11th. These examples fully illustrate that any village or household that is careless runs the risk of contracting the rat plague. The continuous death of thirty-four people in Chahan Bengbeng Village was caused by a small merchant suffering from the rat plague.

　　记取察北鼠疫蔓延教训
  　察省厉行严密封锁
    开地房子村封锁认真免于传染北沙城某户感情用事全家死亡
    【本报张家口三日专电】察北鼠疫系从内蒙传来，已获确切证明。据察北防疫总指挥部前两日消息：康保县之南井沟、李占地、康八里、北沙城等村，染鼠疫病死者共十二人，有五人是从内蒙草地带来疫病致死的；其中北沙城村鼠疫之发生，系由于该村某户有一闺女嫁给了内蒙境察汉崩崩村（疫区），其闺女因避鼠疫从察汉崩崩村逃来北沙城，为该村禁止入村后，其母惜儿怜女感情用事，定要出村送她一程，结果带回疫菌，数日内全家七口相继死亡。该县开地房子村因执行了“无情的严格封锁”的命令，拒绝了来自察汉崩崩的一个妇女前往该村躲灾（此妇女旋即病死在村外），该村便未被传染。以上两村的教训与经验，值得各地很好记取。宝源、多伦亦有病情发生，多伦双棚子村有四个人从内蒙草地归来，半路上死了两个，其他两人回村后病了。宝源城关区中医张广川去内蒙五支家村行医，十月六日回家，八日得病，十一日便死去。这些实例充分说明，那村那户麻痹大意，那村那户即有传染鼠疫的危险。察汉崩崩一村连续死亡三十四人，就是由一个患鼠疫的小商人传染开去的。
