　　Beijing's "Grain Tiger" - Wang Zhenting
　　Zheng Zhong
    In the Beijing People's Court detention center, the reporter saw Wang Zhenting, the "Grain Tiger" hated by the people of Beijing. He is forty-three years old this year, tall and sturdy, with a full brain and fat belly, a shiny bald spot, and a greasy face. He wears a large padded hat and a long black serge robe, truly looking like a typical "corpulent merchant." According to citizens familiar with him, Wang came from a wealthy merchant family. His father was the general manager of three grain stores: Yongshenghou, Yongshengde, and Yongshengfu. He himself studied at Shandong University for three years. At the age of twenty-one, he secured the position of secretary director of the Penglai County government, and immediately became a "big master." Later, he successively served as a judge in Pingdu County, section chief and secretary in various counties in Jiaodong, and finally settled in the Yangjiaogou Salt Affairs District of Shouguang County as the district head, with over a hundred salt affairs anti-smuggling team members under his command, specifically using bloody means to suppress impoverished salt farmers. In 1939, he brought capital and fled north to Beijing, retiring to his hometown and engaging in his father's business. After his father's death, he inherited the position of general manager of the three grain stores, engaging in commercial speculation. When Japan surrendered, he used 350,000 yuan of puppet Allied currency to purchase the Changshun Grain Store (the old site of the Changshun Flour Mill). After the Kuomintang took over, he used his party membership and political skills to obtain the position of chairman of the rice and grain industry association, and participated in elections, exchanging ten catties of white flour per vote as a bribe to earn the title of city "councilor." From then on, he actively engaged in activities, colluding with Liang, a secretary director of the Kuomintang social bureau, borrowing large sums of money from banks to handle loan applications for grain. The Changshun Flour Mill was then able to purchase machinery, build Western-style buildings, and make a fortune by hoarding. He also relied on the influence of his fellow townsman He Siyuan (mayor of Beijing during the Kuomintang era) to run rampant in Beijing, sending four clerks every day, each holding cash, to抢购at high prices, fueling the flames and manipulating the black market. Later, due to infighting within the Kuomintang, he was arrested and imprisoned by Wen Chongxin, the head of the puppet social bureau. At that time, he was found to have 130 bags of wheat and 1,800 bags of white flour, but he hid them all and refused to sell them, hoarding and speculating, so the citizens gave him the nickname "Grain Tiger." After our army liberated Beijing, based on the principle of leniency, he was released and all his property was returned to him. It was hoped that he would repent and start anew, but who would have thought that he was greedy and cruel by nature, outwardly compliant but inwardly defiant. After gaining freedom, he stirred up trouble in the market again. Relying on a large amount of gold bars, he bought wheat in quantities of thousands of dan at a time, hoarding and speculating to seek exorbitant profits.
    This time, due to the plague in Chahar and the suspension of trains on the Ping-Sui Railway, Wang Zhenting saw that the opportunity had come again. So, he took advantage of the situation to raise grain prices and create an atmosphere of grain shortage, raising prices three times in one day, and then hiding grain and refusing to sell. When the Food Grain Company changed its wheat selling method, implementing "selling sixty-six catties of wheat for every bag of flour sold," he falsely sold the flour to his affiliated stores Yongshengde, Yongshenghou, and Yongshengfu. He used bad checks to conduct off-site transactions. When the Food Grain Company's price was 25,000 yuan, he privately sold it for 44,000 yuan, making a profit of 10 million yuan in one day. When the poor people went to the public retail stores to buy grain, his nephew laughed and made sarcastic remarks: "Even if you squeeze for half a day, I don't think you will be able to buy grain!"

　　北京的“粮老虎”——王振庭
　　郑重
    在北京市人民法院的看守所里，记者看见了北京人民所痛恨的“粮老虎”王振庭。他今年四十三岁，生得身高体壮、脑满肠肥、顶门发亮、满面油光，头戴大疙瘩帽盔，身穿黑哔叽长袍，看去真是一个典型的“硕腹贾”。据熟悉他的市民谈，王出身于大富商之家，父亲是永盛厚、永盛德、永盛福三家粮店的总经理，他本人曾在山东大学读过三年书。二十一岁谋得了蓬莱县府秘书主任的位置，便一跃而为“大老爷”了。以后历任平都县审判官，胶东各县科长秘书等职，最后落脚在寿光县洋角沟盐务区担任区佐，手下盐务缉私队一百余名，专门用血腥手腕镇压穷苦的盐民。民国二十八年携资北遁、息影故都，从事其父亲的行业。父死之后，便袭任了三个粮店的总经理，进行商业投机。日本投降时，曾以伪联币三十五万购得长顺粮店（即长顺面粉厂旧址）。国民党劫收后，又利用党员资格和政治手腕，取得米面、粮业理事长职位，并参加竞选，以每投一票白面十斤的贿赂，换得市“参议员”头衔。从此大肆活动，与国民党官僚社会局秘书主任梁某勾结，大借银行款项，办理货款办粮手续。长顺粉厂乃得置机器、盖洋楼，大发囤积之财。又仗着同乡何思源（国民党时期北京市长）的势力，横行京市，每日派四号伙友，各持现钞，大价抢购，推波助澜，操纵黑市。后因国民党内部倾轧，被伪社会局长温崇信逮捕下狱，当时曾查获他有小麦一百三十包，白面一千八百袋，但均藏匿拒售，囤积居奇，所以市民们便送他一个“粮老虎”的称号。我军解放北京后，本宽大为怀的宗旨释放了他，并发还他全部财产。本希望他从此痛改前非，重新作人，谁料他贪残成性，阳奉阴违，得了自由，便在市场重新兴风作浪。仗着金条多，买小麦一次就是千把石，囤积居奇，牟取暴利。
    这次因察北鼠疫，平绥线停车，王振庭一看机会又到，于是趁火打劫，哄抬粮价，制造粮荒空气，一日中涨价三次，后并藏粮拒售。当食粮公司变更售麦办法，实行“每卖出面粉一袋即售给小麦六十六斤”后，他又把面粉假卖给他的联号永盛德、永盛厚、永盛福。使用空头支票，进行场外交易。当食粮公司牌价二万五千元时，他私卖四万四千元，一天之中获利一千万元。当贫民们到公营零售店去买粮食的时候，他的侄儿却看笑话，说风凉话：“挨半天挤，我看你们也难以买到粮食吧”！
