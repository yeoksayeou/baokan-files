Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 23rd: The full text of the speech by Indonesian representative Mazono at the Beijing People's Congress celebrating the success of the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference is as follows: Dear Comrades:
    I, on behalf of the fighting Indonesian working masses, extend to you warm fraternal greetings, greetings of freedom. We, the Indonesian people who are fighting for our own liberation, pay tribute to the heroic Chinese people, especially to the great leader of the Chinese people, Mao Zedong, and the Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Zhu De. We are very grateful for your great historical victory, because you have inflicted a decisive defeat on our common enemy—American imperialism and its running dogs. Because of your victory, we, the Indonesian people, although still suffering from the suppression and massacre by American and Dutch imperialism, and although there is the rebellion of the Hatta-Sukarno reactionary group, we are more determined to carry out our national liberation struggle. Your victory has greatly encouraged the vast majority of overseas Chinese living in our country, who are waging a struggle against imperialist oppression and exploitation. We know that your glorious victory has accelerated the liberation of Indonesia.
    Chairman Mao Zedong has pointed out the road to winning national liberation, people's democracy, and lasting peace not only to the Chinese people but also to all oppressed humanity in the world. Therefore, we thank you for your glorious victory. It is this glorious victory that enabled this great and historic Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference to be held in Beijing, the victorious China. This is of great significance, it is a great victory for the international working class and a serious blow to imperialism. This conference especially gave a warning to American imperialism, because it is engaging in war and plunder against our Asian and Australian colonies together with British, French and Dutch imperialism, and is plotting to occupy various countries as their base for aggression against the Soviet Union and the People's China. This conference decided to establish an Asian-Australian Liaison Bureau, which will greatly enhance the fighting strength of the working masses of various countries and further strengthen our international unity. This conference fully demonstrates the strong unity of the world's workers, especially the unity of the working masses in imperialist countries and the workers in colonies striving for national liberation. At this conference, the Dutch workers' representatives assured us that they would work together with our Indonesian workers to jointly fight to stop the colonial war and realize Indonesian national independence. Due to the increasing solidarity of the Dutch workers, and due to the increasing strength of the world peace forces headed by the Soviet Union, we, the Indonesian people, are continuing to move forward in the struggle. Comrades, on behalf of the Indonesian workers, I assure you that we must support your victory by strengthening our common struggle!
    Long live the close unity between the Chinese and Indonesian working classes!
    Long live the World Federation of Trade Unions!
    Long live the heroic Chinese people and their leader Mao Zedong!

　　印尼代表玛佐诺讲话
    【新华社北京二十三日电】印尼代表玛佐诺在北京各界人民庆祝亚澳工会会议成功大会上的讲话全文如下：亲爱的同志们：
    我代表战斗的印尼工人群众，向你们致热烈的兄弟的敬礼，致自由的敬礼。我们正在为自己的解放而斗争的印尼人民，向英勇的中国人民，特别是向中国人民伟大领袖毛泽东和中国人民解放军总司令朱德致敬。我们非常感激你们的伟大的历史性的胜利，因为你们使我们共同的敌人——美帝国主义及其走狗遭受决定性的失败。由于你们的胜利，我们印尼人民，虽然还受着美荷帝国主义的镇压和屠杀，虽然有哈达、苏加诺反动集团的反叛，但我们却更加坚决地进行我们的民族解放斗争。你们的胜利，更大大地鼓舞了住在我国的绝大多数的华侨，他们正在进行着反对帝国主义的压迫和剥削的斗争。我们知道，你们光荣的胜利，加速了我们印尼的解放。
    毛泽东主席不但给中国人民，而且给全世界所有被压迫人类，指出了如何赢得民族解放、人民民主和持久和平的道路。因此我们感谢你们光荣的胜利。就是这光荣的胜利，使这次伟大的有历史性的亚澳工会会议，能够在胜利的中国的北京召开。这是有着重大意义的，这是国际工人阶级的巨大胜利，也是对帝国主义的严重打击。这次大会特别给美帝国主义一个警告，因为它正和英、法、荷帝国主义在一起，对我们亚澳各殖民地国家进行战争和掠夺，并阴谋侵占各国作为他们侵略苏联与人民中国的基地。这次大会决定成立亚澳联络局，这将大大增强各国工人群众的斗争力量，并进一步加强我们的国际团结。这次大会充分表示了世界工人的坚强团结，特别是帝国主义国家工人群众和殖民地争取民族解放的工人的团结。在这个大会上，荷兰工人代表向我们保证，他们要和我们印尼工人一起，为停止殖民战争和实现印尼民族独立而共同斗争。由于荷兰工人的日见团结，由于以苏联为首的世界和平力量的日见增强，我们印尼人民，正在斗争中继续前进。同志们，我代表印尼工人，向你们保证，我们一定要以加强我们共同的斗争来支持你们的胜利！
    中国和印尼的工人阶级亲密团结万岁！
    世界工联万岁！
    英勇的中国人民和他的领袖毛泽东万岁！
