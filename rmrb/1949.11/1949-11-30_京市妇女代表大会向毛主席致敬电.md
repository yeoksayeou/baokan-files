The Beijing Women's Congress Sends a Congratulatory Message to Chairman Mao
[Beijing News] The first Beijing Women's Congress successfully concluded yesterday (29th). The Congress issued two congratulatory messages, one to Chairman Mao and the other to the All-China Democratic Women's Federation. The original messages are as follows:

Respected Chairman Mao:

We report to you with boundless joy and excitement that 371 representatives elected from all walks of life and industries in the capital have held the first women's congress in Beijing's history. We have summarized the women's work of the past nine months since liberation, determined the future work guidelines and tasks, elected the first executive committee, and established the Beijing Democratic Women's Federation. For the past four days, we have gathered together like a family, using our own language to discuss our own work issues. We are truly liberated and have stood up. Never forgetting those who dug the well when we drink water, we deeply know that our ability to unite so closely and hold the congress so freely and happily is entirely due to the victory of the Chinese people's revolution led by you. Here, we, on behalf of the millions of women in the city, extend our highest respects to you – the great people's leader, Chairman Mao! Under your wise leadership, we will more broadly and deeply unite women from all walks of life in the capital to strive for the construction of the new China and the new capital, and for the cause of women's liberation in China!
