　　North China Provinces and Cities Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives Drafts Plans
  　Organize Disaster Victims for Self-Salvation and Vigorously Develop Rural Sideline Occupations
　　[Reported by this newspaper] Supply and marketing cooperatives in North China provinces and cities have successively formulated plans to carry out rural sideline and handicraft production this winter and next spring, organize production to overcome famine, solve part of the food problems of disaster victims, and develop cooperatives through business development.
　　Hebei
　　This year, Hebei Province has 27 million mu of flooded cultivated land, accounting for more than one-fourth of the total area. In addition, 47 counties have insect plagues, and coastal areas have wind disasters, making life difficult for people in disaster areas. Based on the above situation, the Provincial Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives decided that the general task is to organize production for disaster relief, carry out transportation, and regulate coal and grain. In general disaster areas, organize the production of homespun cloth, pockets, and straw braided hats. There are 578,550 looms in the province, with an average annual output of 5,894,154 bolts of homespun cloth. At present, when foreign cloth is still in short supply, it is decided to focus on restoring textile production in disaster areas in a planned manner, managing 300,000 bolts per month, two-thirds of which will be sold to the Northwest and one-third to the Northeast. Ten strands of coarse yarn and coarse cotton are prepared for weavers in exchange for cloth. The areas for development are Tongxian Prefecture, Tangshan Prefecture, Xianxian County, and Shimen Prefecture. The cooperatives of Shimen, Dingxian, and Handan prefectures have also formed a "Joint Office" in Taiyuan, planning to sell 310,000 bolts of homespun cloth from October this year to February next year, in exchange for 334,530 jin of grain. The focus of pocket weaving is Xianxian County, Raoyang County, and Jingxian County, with a plan to purchase 150,000 pockets for sale in Beijing, Tianjin, and the Northeast. Straw braided hats are export goods, and vigorous development is also planned. According to statistics from six counties in Cangxian Prefecture, there are 73,000 practitioners, producing 8,175 jin per day. Currently, due to insufficient raw materials, only 2,000 jin are collected per day. The half-year plan is to purchase 108,000 jin.
　　In water towns, organize fisheries and mat weaving. Anxin, Jinghai, Yutian, and Fengrun counties have a total of 78,286 mat weaving workers, each producing one mat per day, that is, more than 70,000 mats are produced. It is planned to purchase 700,000 mats for sale to the Northeast and Northwest, and to control 50,000 reeds, implementing reed-for-mat exchanges. In terms of fisheries, organize diverse fish management groups, "fishing net teams," and fishery cooperatives, etc., and combine bank loans to solve the difficulty of fishing gear. In mountainous areas, organize activities such as mining mica, asbestos, medicinal materials, gold digging, and firewood gathering. In addition, in order to solve the supply of coal and grain, vigorously develop material exchanges with neighboring regions and organize transportation cooperatives. It is planned to exchange Gaoyang cloth, homespun cloth, reed mats, and other items for 30 million jin of grain and 40,000 pieces of 20-count yarn.
　　Pingyuan
　　Pingyuan Province currently has more than 3,000 members in straw braided hat cooperatives, and plans to expand to 15,000 members, purchasing 500 bundles of braids. Jiaozuo and Liuhegou in the province are famous coal mining areas. The Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives plans to strive to transport 10,000 tons of coal, establish "coal stations" in Linpu, Wulong, Daokou, Anyang and other places, and establish a general station in Xinxiang. Organize water or vehicle transportation, in addition to supplying rural daily burning coal, also supply brick burning, to lay the foundation for well digging next spring. In other sideline industries, it is planned to organize carpenters, blacksmiths, weaving craftsmen, etc. in rural areas to use bamboo from Qinghua (Boai) to manufacture various production tools. Organize cooperatives with technology, tools, manpower, and capital as shares, and help solve the difficulties of funds, raw materials and sales of finished products when necessary, and strive to manufacture and supply farmers with 100,000 pieces of agricultural tools this winter and next spring. In addition, according to the different conditions of different regions, develop dozens of kinds of production such as fishing, weaving mats, digging medicinal materials, animal husbandry, manufacturing saltpeter, weaving pockets, hairnets, silk, homespun cloth, grinding flour, and fur.
　　Chahar
　　Chahar Province has a large output of medicinal materials, mainly including 23 kinds such as ephedra, astragalus, anemarrhena, scutellaria, and licorice, with an annual output of approximately 25 million jin. The Provincial Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives regards organizing the digging of medicinal materials as one of the central tasks of winter production, calling on cooperatives in various places to vigorously carry out the movement to dig medicinal materials to prepare for famine. Special emphasis is placed on organizing all forces in disaster areas to invest in this movement. The Chicheng County Supply and Marketing Cooperative plans to purchase 4 million jin of medicinal materials by February next year, solving the problem of one month's food supply for disaster victims throughout the county. The provincial cooperative also compiled and printed a booklet on "How to Purchase Medicinal Materials," explaining the seasonality of digging medicinal materials, quality differences, processing, packaging and other knowledge. Urban supply and marketing cooperatives such as Zhangjiakou, Xuanhua, and Datong, based on the principle of facing the countryside, organize the production of agricultural tools. For example, the Xuanhua City Cooperative organized 66 blacksmith shops in the city to build 57,600 iron shovels and picks, and 10,000 plows. It organized 45 carpentry shops to complete 300 iron-roofed ox carts and 100 spoked carts before February. It also organized manure collectors to establish manure factories and purchase bones for fertilizer production. In addition, according to the specific situation, develop different sideline and handicraft production in various places, such as Yanqing flour mills, Chabei sweet potato starch, Chanan oil mills, weaving industry, and Yu County's hemp rope industry.
　　The provincial and municipal federations unanimously pointed out that in the winter and spring production, the grassroots cooperatives must develop cooperative organizations through business operations. Vigorously carry out contract business, sign contracts with various specialized companies, and organize production teams for handicraftsmen and small producers and adopt ordering methods to strengthen the planning of production.

　　华北各省市供销社拟定计划
  　组织灾民生产自救　大力发展农村副业
    【本报讯】华北各省市合作社纷纷订出计划，在今冬明春开展农村副业及手工业生产，组织生产渡荒，解决灾民部分食粮，并通过业务发展合作社。
    河北
    河北省今年水淹耕地两千七百万亩，占总面积四分之一以上。此外四十七县有虫灾，沿海有风灾，灾区人民生活困难。根据以上情况，该省供销合作总社决定总的任务是组织生产救灾，开展运输，调剂煤粮。在一般灾区组织土布、口袋、草帽辫的生产。全省共有织机五七八五五○张，平均年产土布五、八九四、一五四匹。在目前洋布尚不足用情况下，决有计划的着重恢复灾区纺织，每月经营三十万匹，三分之二推销西北，三分之一销向东北，并准备十支粗纱及粗皮棉供织户以布交换。开展地点为通县专区、唐山专区、献县及石门专区。石门、定县、邯郸三个专区社并在太原组“联合办事处”，计划从今年十月至明年二月推销土布三十一万匹，换回粮食三三四、五三○斤。织口袋的重点为献县、饶阳、景县，计划收购十五万条，推销京、津及东北。草帽辫为出口货，亦计划大力发展。据沧县专区六个县统计，从业者七万三千人，日产八一七五斤，现因原料不足日收两千斤。半年计划收购十万零八千斤。
    水乡地区组织渔业和编席。安新、静海、玉田、丰润四县共有编席工人七八、二八六人，每人日产一张，即产七万多张，计划收购七十万张推销东北、西北，并掌握苇子五万个，实行以苇换席。渔业方面则组织多种多样的治鱼组、“打网班”及渔业合作社等，并结合银行贷款，解决治鱼工具困难。在山地则组织采云母、石棉、药材、挖金、打柴等。另外为了解决煤粮供应，将大力开展友邻区的物资交换及组织运输合作社，计划以高阳布、土布、苇席等物换回粮食三千万斤和二十支纱四万块。
    平原
    平原省现有稻草帽辫社员三千多人，计划发展到一万五千人，收购辫子五百包。该省焦作、六河沟等地为著名煤矿区，供销总社计划争取运煤一万吨，在临濮、武隆、道口、安阳等地设立“煤炭站”，并在新乡建立总站。组织水运或车运，除供给农村日用烧煤外，并供给烧砖，为明春打井奠下基础。其他副业方面，计划在农村大量组织木匠、铁匠、编织匠等运用清化（博爱）的竹子制造各种生产工具。并组织技术、工具、人力、资本合股的合作社，必要时帮助解决资金、原料和推销成品的困难，争取今冬明春制造和供给农民十万件农具。此外并根据不同地区的不同情况，开展捕鱼、织席、刨药、牧畜、制硝、织口袋、发网、绸绡、土布、磨粉、皮毛等数十种生产。
    察省
    察省药材产量很大，主要有麻黄、黄芪、知母、黄芩、甘草等二十三种，年产约两千五百多万斤。该省供销总社把组织刨药作为冬季生产的中心工作之一，号召各地合作社大力开展刨药备荒运动。特别着重在灾区组织一切力量投入这一运动中。赤城县供销社计划到明年二月。收购药材四百万斤，解决全县灾民一个月吃粮。省社并编印“怎样收购药材”的小册子，讲解刨药的季节性，质量的区别，加工、包装等知识。城市供销社如张、宣、大同等市，根据面向农村的方针，组织农具生产。如宣化市社组织全市六十六家铁匠炉，打造铁锨和镐五七六○○把，铧一万个，组织四十五户木匠铺，二月前完成铁瓦牛车三百辆，花轮车一百辆，并组织粪夫成立粪厂，收买骨头供给制肥。此外还根据具体情况发展各地不同副业、手工业生产，如延庆粉房、察北山芋淀粉、察南油房、编织业、蔚县的麻绳业等。
    各省市总社一致指出，各基层社在冬春生产中，要通过经营业务，发展合作组织。大力开展合同业务，与各专业公司商订合同，对手工业者和小生产者可组织生产小组及采用订货方式，以加强生产的计划性。（郑重）
