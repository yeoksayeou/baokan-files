　　Welcoming the Uprising of the Two Airlines
    The four thousand employees of the China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) and the Central Air Transport Corporation (CATC), originally belonging to Kuomintang bureaucratic capital, resolutely revolted under the leadership of the two company general managers, Mr. Liu Jingyi and Mr. Chen Zhuolin, broke away from the Kuomintang bandit gang, and accepted the leadership of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China. Mr. Liu Jingyi and Mr. Chen Zhuolin have flown to Beijing, and another eleven airplanes have flown back to the motherland. The remaining employees of the two companies in Hong Kong are also united in their loyalty to the motherland and the people, protecting the repair shops and materials remaining in Hong Kong, and awaiting the takeover by the Central People's Government. We express our warm welcome to this patriotic feat, extend our congratulations and greetings to the general managers and all employees of the two companies who carried out this feat, and express our infinite confidence in the people's aviation undertaking that will be developed on the basis of the two companies.
    The head offices of China National Aviation Corporation and Central Air Transport Corporation are both in Shanghai and have been taken over by the People's Government. The general managers and all employees of the two companies have also announced their acceptance of the leadership of our Central People's Government. Under these circumstances, the assets of the two companies remaining in Hong Kong undoubtedly belong to the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China. This sacred property right of our Central People's Government should be respected by the Hong Kong authorities and should not be destroyed or harmed in any way. Although reactionaries will inevitably conspire to sabotage the property of the two companies remaining in Hong Kong and threaten the patriotic employees of the two companies remaining in Hong Kong, we believe that the thousands of patriotic employees of the two companies will be able to unite, heighten their vigilance, and overcome any conspiracies and intimidation in order to complete the glorious task of protecting the property of the people's motherland. We wish the employees of the two companies in Hong Kong success in their efforts!

　　欢迎两航空公司起义
    原属国民党官僚资本的中国航空公司和中央航空公司全体员工四千人，在两公司总经理刘敬宜先生和陈卓林先生领导下毅然起义，脱离国民党匪帮，接受中华人民共和国中央人民政府的领导。刘敬宜陈卓林两先生已飞抵北京，另十一架飞机已飞回祖国。两公司留在香港的其余员工，也团结一致，效忠祖国和人民，保护留在香港的修理厂和资材，等候中央人民政府的接收。我们对于这个爱国的壮举表示热烈的欢迎，对于举行这个壮举的两公司总经理和全体员工表示祝贺和慰问，对于将在两公司基础上发展起来的人民航空事业，表示无限的信心。
    中国航空公司和中央航空公司的总公司都在上海，已被人民政府所接收，两公司的总经理和全体员工又已宣布接受我中央人民政府的领导，在这种情况下，两公司留在香港的资财，已属中华人民共和国中央人民政府所有，当然是毫无疑义的了。我中央人民政府的这个神圣的产权，应当受到香港当局的尊重，而不应当受到任何破坏和危害。虽然反动分子必然会阴谋破坏两公司留在香港的财产，威胁两公司留在香港的爱国员工，但是我们相信，两公司数千爱国员工，必能团结一致，提高警惕性，战胜任何阴谋恫吓，以完成保护人民祖国财产的光荣任务。敬祝两公司留港员工努力的胜利！
