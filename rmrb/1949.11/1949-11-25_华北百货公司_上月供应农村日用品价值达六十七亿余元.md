　　North China Department Store
　　Supplied Rural Areas with Over 6.7 Billion Yuan Worth of Daily Necessities Last Month
    [Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 23rd] The North China Department Store allocated daily necessities worth 6,760,000,000 yuan to its affiliated branches in various regions in October, directly supplying farmers. Among these daily necessities, groceries such as matches, soda ash, and kerosene accounted for 41% of the total, cotton cloth accounted for over 35%, and the remainder included knitwear, rubber products, paints, stationery, and paper, all of which are daily necessities needed by farmers. At the same time, the company vigorously supported local light industrial production, helping them to promote product sales. In October, the company established 100 ordering and processing/sales contracts with Tianjin rubber, knitting, and other factories, granting loans to these factories totaling over 4.4 billion yuan. In addition, it signed sales contracts with 95 factories producing knitwear, leather goods, and other products. In promoting the products of various factories, the company strives to promote high-quality but lesser-known products, in order to avoid the unfavorable production phenomenon of some goods being in short supply while others have no sales channels. The company provides various forms of assistance to factories whose production is in difficulty due to lack of capital turnover or raw materials. The company also decided to support industrial production in the locations of its affiliated branches in order to supply the countryside nearby.

　　华北百货公司
　　上月供应农村日用品价值达六十七亿余元
    【新华社天津二十三日电】华北百货公司十月份内曾以价值六十七亿六千万元的日用品，拨给所属各地分、支公司，直接供应农民。此项日用品中火柴、碱面、煤油等各种杂货占总数的百分之四十一，纱布占百分之三十五以上，其余为针织品、胶制品、颜料、文具纸张等，均为农民所需的日用品。同时，该公司又大力扶植各地轻工业生产，帮助其推广产品销路。十月份内，该公司曾和天津橡胶、针织等工厂分别建立订货和加工包销合同一百份，贷给各厂的贷款达四十四亿余元。此外，并与针织、皮件等九十五家工厂订立了经销合同。在推销各厂产品中，该公司尽力推销质量好但非有名的产品，以免除一部货品供不应求，而另一部货品又无销路的不利生产的现象。凡因资金周转不灵、原料缺乏致生产陷于困境的工厂，该公司均多方予以帮助。该公司并决定扶植所属各分支公司所在地的工业生产，以便就近供应农村。
