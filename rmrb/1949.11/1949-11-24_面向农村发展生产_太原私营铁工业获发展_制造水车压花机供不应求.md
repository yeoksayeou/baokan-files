　　Facing Rural Development and Production
　　Taiyuan's Private Iron Industry Achieves Development
　　Manufacturing Waterwheels and Cotton Ginning Machines are in Short Supply
    [Report from this newspaper] Taiyuan's private iron industry has achieved rapid recovery and development by serving agricultural, rural sideline, and handicraft production. During its peak, the city's private iron industry had thirty-four firms. After being devastated and annexed by the bandit Yan Xishan, only eight firms barely survived by the time of Taiyuan's liberation. After liberation, the Taiyuan Military Control Commission first returned the nine private iron factories that Yan Xishan had forcibly merged into Jinxing Machinery Company to their original owners. Then, the public sector industry helped the private iron industry solve the problems of raw materials and power. In particular, after the people's government's publicity and explanation, the ideological concerns of iron industrialists were initially eliminated. By the end of July, twenty-four firms had resumed operations. Because they couldn't grasp the direction of production at the time, the foundry industry mostly cast a batch of cold goods such as pots, fire mouths, and stove bars, and the machinery industry was limited to repairing broken machines sent by employers, unable to carry out production in a planned way. After September, due to the increasing number of rural orders for machines such as waterwheels and cotton ginning machines, and the banks' loans and rice support for the industry, iron industry production was rapidly restored. For example, Yitai, Daxing, and Tongchengxing iron factories produced more than eighty cotton ginning machines in about a month, and they were sold as soon as they were produced, never being stocked. Linong and Wancheng iron factories produced twenty waterwheels in October, and Yilong factory produced six sets of animal-powered oil presses suitable for rural oil pressing, all of which were sold as soon as they were produced. Several iron industrialists have felt that the production of cotton ginning machines cannot meet the demand. The Yitai iron factory was often busy rushing to manufacture orders in October. By the end of October, the number of private iron factories had rapidly increased to thirty-three.

　　面向农村发展生产
　　太原私营铁工业获发展
　　制造水车压花机供不应求
    【本报讯】太原市私营铁工业在为农业、农村副业、手工业生产服务中，已获得迅速恢复与发展。该市私营铁工业，在最盛时期有三十四户，后经阎匪摧残、吞并，至太原解放时，只有八家勉强维持。解放后，太原军管会首先将阎匪强并入晋兴机械公司的九家私营铁工厂发还原主，接着公营工业帮助私营铁工业解决了原料、动力问题，特别是经过人民政府的宣传解释，初步消除了铁工业者的思想顾虑，到七月底，已有二十四家复业。由于当时摸不住生产方向，翻砂业大部铸造了一批锅、火口、炉条等冷货，机器业者也只限于修理主雇送上门来的坏机器，不能有计划的进行生产。至九月以后，由于农村订购水车、压花机等机器者日多，及银行给该行业贷款贷米扶植，使铁工业生产得到迅速的恢复。如义泰、大兴、同成兴三家铁工厂，一个月左右即生产八十余架压花机，而且随产随销，从未压货。利农、万成两家铁工厂十月份生产了二十部水车，义隆工厂生产了六盘农村榨油适用的畜力油碾，都是随产随销。若干铁工业者，已感到压花机的生产供不应求，义泰铁工厂在十月里经常忙于赶的造订货。至十月底，私营铁工厂已迅速增加至三十三家。
