How Can People's Geography Teachers Implement Ideological and Political Education?
    Sun Jingzhi
  　I. Opposing the Confused Idea that "Geography Has Little Class Character"
    Among many intellectuals and even a few cadres, there is a notion that "History textbooks must be revised, but old geography textbooks can be used without much harm." Or, "Geography textbooks only need to change their viewpoints." This is incorrect. In reality, the so-called viewpoint is first determined by class stand, and it is absolutely not isolated, but mixed into the geography textbooks and permeates every aspect. Therefore, the idea that reactionary viewpoints can be taken out of old geography materials, like picking sand out of rice, and the rest will completely conform to the interests of the people is not in accordance with the facts.
    Even if many old geography scholars sincerely deny having stood on the bourgeoisie's position in the past, their works do indeed express the bourgeoisie's position in various forms. Here are a few simple examples:
    (1) A most popular old geography book says: "...Occasionally, some dissimilar regions are combined into a province, simply to balance material resources and facilitate transportation. For example, Chahar's taking old Hebei land, and Ningxia and Qinghai taking old Gansu land, are all because other parts, although vast in area, cannot financially support the needs of provincial organization." Was the original division of the ten counties of Koubei Dao in Hebei Province to Chahar Province to make the Han people of these ten counties bear the administrative expenses for the Inner Mongolian people? Or to use them as pillars for the Kuomintang's Great Han chauvinist provincial government? Or to exploit the contradictions between Han and Mongolians for easier rule? It is certain that the latter is true. The former is merely a formal "Bodhisattva face." According to general principles, the Kuomintang Great Han chauvinists' seizure of land from ethnic minorities is definitely not to "lose money and make a noise," but to make money. This Bodhisattva face is like a merchant hanging up the "big sale" sign for 365 days a year, but in fact, they have a firm principle: "No profit, no sale." Isn't this the truth? And those who stand on the bourgeoisie's position, regardless of whether they are aware of it or not, will inevitably produce such erroneous understanding. To correct mistakes, one must first change one's stand.
    (2) I saw a geography book published during the Kuomintang's rule that advocated "One World Under Heaven" and claimed to be "internationalist"; it advocated that "the resources and markets of all countries should be open to all." There are three ways to share: First, develop aviation. Second, trade. Third, eliminate narrow-minded thoughts and practices. I completely agree that when socialism is realized throughout the world, or between various new democratic countries and socialist countries today, it is good to implement these three methods. Because the essence of these countries determines the authenticity of exchange, commerce, equality, and mutual benefit. However, it is too early to promote "One World Under Heaven" during the era when the Chiang Kai-shek Four Families ruled China. Because at that time, "trade" was directed towards the United States, and due to the aggressive nature of American imperialism and China's backwardness and dependence on the political conditions of American imperialism—the Chiang regime—the term "One World Under Heaven" had the opposite meaning. If it were realized, it would symbolize that the people of all countries in the world had become slaves of American imperialism. Therefore, we can affirm that this kind of thinking is absolutely not "internationalism," but a thorough "cosmopolitanism" forerunner. It is speaking from the standpoint of American imperialism, absolutely not from the standpoint of the people. Its effect can only increase the slavishness of weak nations and disarm them.
    (3) I have also seen some books that not only promote the bourgeoisie's viewpoint but also incorporate fascist theories. In a political geography notebook from a certain university, countries are divided into four stages: infancy, youth, adulthood, and old age.
    "1. Infancy – peaceful nature, demanding self-preservation, such as the United States from 1776 to 1803.
    2. Youth – aggressive nature, posing a threat to the international community. Such as the United States from 1803 to 1918.
    3. Adulthood – conservative nature, such as Britain after the 20th century.
    4. Old age – Discipline is lax, becoming the object of aggression by other countries, such as China in the late Qing Dynasty."
    This set of theories is absolutely not a "historical viewpoint," but uses historical development to justify fascist aggression. The originator of this theory is Ratzel, who mechanically applied the viewpoint of biological evolution to state institutions, which was later used by fascist elements such as Kjellen and his disciple Haushofer. What is its essence? In a word, it is "aggression is justified," throwing the aggressor's butcher knife at the door of "History" itself. For example, countries in their youth are by nature aggressive, and countries in their old age invite aggression due to lax discipline. That is to say, the "butcher" is a strong man, and the slaughtered is a lamb. Isn't this the logic of the Hitler gang?
    Even more ridiculous, he divides the outline of countries into eight forms—nearly circular, triangular, quadrilateral, rectangular, pentagonal, polygonal, long and narrow, and deformed. I don't know what the purpose of such "in-depth research" is, or what problem it seeks to solve. Perhaps one can find some rules in it, such as that nearly circular countries must have "sesame seed cakes mountains," and long and narrow countries (such as Chile) must produce bread mines. That would be very lucky, but I only like to live in quadrilateral countries. I estimate that there will be an inexhaustible supply of stinky tofu there. I love to eat square stinky tofu.
    (4) In Geodeshi's The Geographical Foundation of China (Kaiming translation), he promotes Malthus's population theory, advocating using "birth control" (a peaceful term for murder) to solve China's land problem, and opposes premature revolutions. What his intentions are need not be discussed further.
    This book had a great influence in China. Except for a few sentences that are acceptable, the vast majority of the viewpoints are reactionary. Readers should pay attention to this.
    There are too many such examples; readers should find them themselves.
    II. What Can Be Used to Open the Treasure Trove of People's Geography?
    Recently, many people hope to quickly master scientific methods, criticize and discard erroneous things, absorb good materials, and build a new geography that serves the people. This is very kind.
    What steps are required to master scientific methods? Can it be like a key on a lock, so that anyone who gets it can immediately open the treasure trove of new geography? My answer: "Yes." That is to first "firmly stand on the people's position, improve political theory, and become a conscious revolutionary." Everyone knows that a "conscious revolutionary" is someone who wholeheartedly does good things for the people, who combines their own lives, interests, and emotions with the lives, interests, and emotions of the people; it is easy to say this in words, but doing it requires arduous struggle. In other words, only when your actions can genuinely and consistently benefit the people's cause can it be proven that you have stood on the people's position.
    People's geography teachers cannot stop at teaching mountains, rivers, and statistics. What is more important is political tasks and teaching effectiveness. They do not treat teaching geography as a "mealtime mantra," but as a tool to complete ideological and political education. People's geography teachers seek methods from a firm and conscious position of doing good for the people, rather than from "concepts." They learn new methods to abandon the old, not to preserve the old. This is the essential difference between people's geography teachers and old geography teachers.
    Scientific methods are linked to and inseparable from position and viewpoint. Therefore, anyone who does not stand on the people's position cannot become a close friend of scientific methods.
    III. What Political Tasks Should Be Completed in Geography Teaching?
    Since people's geography teachers regard geography lessons as one of the tools for ideological and political education, what political tasks should they complete? I have written a few key points below:
    Cultivate the Spirit of Patriotism and Internationalism
    Our so-called patriotism is not based on nationalism, but on internationalism. That is to say, we must stand on the people's position to love our country, love the people's motherland, and also love all countries in the world that belong to the people.
    We should not love China from a "conceptual" point of view, but love China with concrete actions. From the perspective of geography teachers, doing a good job of implementing ideological and political education and paying attention to teaching effectiveness is the most realistic and needed patriotic behavior.
    How to conduct patriotic education in geography?
    First, students must know that "our motherland is vast," accounting for one-thirteenth of the world's land (excluding Antarctica), about the same as the entire Europe. It has the highest plateau in the world, where there are unlimited uranium and gold mines. It has deserts like seas of yellow waves, which will be transformed into vast fertile fields in the construction of New China. It has the world's largest production and reserves of tungsten, antimony, copper, and other minerals, which are the foundation of New China's heavy industry construction. It has the world's largest production of rice, wheat, soybeans, sorghum... The yields will be further increased in the construction of New China, to supply the needs of the people nationwide. It has the only huge construction visible to astronomers on the moon—the Great Wall and the world's longest artificial river. It has a quarter of the world's population, reborn under the banner of Mao Zedong. It has a rich history and culture of more than four thousand years, where countless heroic poems are woven, recording the common glorious history of all ethnic groups in China.
    Second, today's New China is even more lovable because it will completely eliminate the dark rule of feudalism, imperialism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and allow the people to be masters of their own house. Because it has given the vast number of farmers the land they need for life, eliminating the phenomenon of extreme poverty, and changing the farmers' pots from bran and vegetable cakes to yellow dry food. Because it allows everyone to have work to do and everyone to have books to read, and landlords and rich peasants are given the same share of land to participate in labor and production. Because it has placed all ethnic groups in a truly equal position, helping each other and working together. More importantly, it has laid a solid foundation for China to move towards a more free and happy socialist society.
    Third, it is also glorious to be a citizen of New China because, in the hundred years of liberation struggle, we have produced the most advanced revolutionary vanguard—the Chinese Communist Party—and found the wise leader Mao Zedong. Mao Zedong is glory, Mao Zedong is victory. Because, in the construction of New China—the establishment of Soviet areas and anti-Japanese base areas behind enemy lines—the sons and daughters of China have shown unparalleled determination and tenacity. They can regard death as home, dedicating their heads for the interests of the people. This is the most sublime morality in the new society.
    Fourth, we should use all geographical materials to explain the excellent conditions for the construction of New China, so that students have such confidence, victory, and glory are ours. Thoroughly eliminate the remnants of the bourgeoisie's nonsense that "communism is not suitable for China's national conditions," and inspire them to love the country and be willing to give their lives for the people's New China when necessary.
    Fifth, it must be explained that the world's democratic forces are immensely powerful. They possess one-third of the world's population and one-quarter of the world's land (referring only to the new democratic and socialist countries; the democratic forces in capitalist countries are not included). They are united like one person. The early victory of the Chinese People's Great Revolution is inseparable from the consistent struggle of the democratic forces. At the same time, due to the success of the Chinese People's Great Revolution, the overall victory of the world's democratic forces has been further consolidated.
    In addition, it should be noted that we should use all specific materials to expose the shameless clamor of war-mongers and strengthen our hatred for the enemy. This is another aspect of cultivating the spirit of patriotism and internationalism. In a word, it is to promote the early death of the reactionary and corrupt old things and the early victory of the new and progressive things.
    Point Out That Humanity is the Transformer of Nature
    Man is part of nature, and at the same time, the transformer of nature. In technical terms, "man is the opposite of nature." In the great geographical dictionary of the people, the terms "adapting to the environment" and "adjusting to the environment" cannot be found. Only making nature conform to the interests of mankind. To be more precise, humanity has prospered to this day from the constant struggle to conquer nature. In the dawn of mankind, floods, beasts, violent storms, and rainstorms constantly attacked human lives, and epidemics and hunger also caused massive deaths. But thanks to the spirit of unity and heroic battles, humanity finally gained freedom. In the future, after the elimination of classes all over the world, an even broader road of marching towards nature will unfold.
    In geography, there are plenty of examples to illustrate such a truth—man is the transformer of nature. The Yellow River and Yangtze River have been regarded as "natural barriers" since ancient times, and the Kuomintang bandits once prided themselves on possessing such natural barriers. But in front of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, as long as Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu issue an order, the "natural barrier" immediately kneels before the people. This is a very recent example that I believe everyone has not forgotten, right?
    In the past, in the consciousness of ordinary people, insect plagues were thought to be caused by "godly insects," an irresistible force, and nature's punishment for mankind. Reactionary governments have never cared about these things, and therefore would not conquer such disasters. The People's Government is just the opposite. It puts promoting production and caring for people's lives at the top of its work agenda. Under the call of the government, under the concentrated will of the people, it used its own hands to eliminate them.
    The word "natural disaster" also seems inappropriate. I am a supporter of "outstanding people and a blessed land" because "natural disasters" can be conquered by mankind and must be conquered by mankind itself.
    The reason why the Yellow River basin is the cradle of Chinese culture is that the builders of the North China Plain, for hundreds of millions of years, have tirelessly and diligently carried out this great and arduous work, not even dozing off at night. At the same time, the Yellow River is also a terrifying word. The people of the North China Plain unanimously agreed to give it the nickname "China's worry." It has changed its course dozens of times in four thousand years (eight or nine major changes), drowning millions of people and inundating countless fields and livestock. But the Yellow River refused to accept any awards or punishments. It sighed and recited two doggerel poems.
    (1)
    Diligent construction for hundreds of millions of years,
    Eventually, the sea will become a mulberry field.
    Wind blows wheat ears a thousand miles,
    Bumper harvests make the people smile,
    Chinese culture started here,
    Old Yellow flows with blood and sweat. × × × ×
    (2)
    The rainy season comes, day after day,
    It is natural for mountain floods to erupt.
    Mountains and rivers are rapid,
    Scraping the land is like a tractor;
    Countless yellow sands are sent into the river,
    It is really difficult to carry sediment.
    I want to carry it to the East China Sea,
    The weight is great,
    The road is far,
    Subjective wishes are difficult to realize;
    A short rest on the thousand-mile journey,
    Isn't this reasonable? (It asks seriously)
    Unexpectedly,
    Overnight, sediment settled and leveled the riverbank.
    I admit,
    Flooding and changing course are indeed common,
    But there's nothing I can do if the riverbed can't be built on the tip of Kunlun!
    I don't accept praise,
    It's really unfair to complain about Old Yellow,
    The reason is simple:
    Natural orders cannot be violated,
    Natural laws cannot be messed with. × × × ×
    Old Yellow was very unhappy and finally rambled a few more sentences: "Who can say that it is unreasonable for mountain floods to erupt and river water to overflow when the rainy season comes!?" "Who can say that it is unreasonable for mountain floods to erupt and river water to overflow when the rainy season comes!?" ...
    The Yellow River's flooding and changing course cannot be blamed on the Yellow River. One must understand and grasp its personality—before the river is conquered, it is "as fierce as water and fire, and mercilessly eats people," but once it is grasped by people, it will be "respectful, diligent, and never tired." Old Yellow's protest is correct. The occurrence of past Yellow River disasters is the responsibility of corrupt and reactionary rulers.
    The Yellow River may still flood in the future, which can only be attributed to humanity's ability to control nature and China's current material conditions, because the People's Government will repair the Yellow River with all its strength. The facts have already shown this!
    Someone continues to ask, isn't there any place where mankind conforms to nature? Why is a railway built on flat riverbanks rather than on high mountains? Why is agriculture necessarily carried out on warm plains rather than planted in the Arctic and Antarctic? I can only answer irrelevantly, "This is not conforming to nature, because mankind has no losses doing this!" This is precisely that mankind has mastered nature—the rules of nature (I admit that mankind cannot leave nature for a moment, but mankind has its initiative), and utilized nature.
    Cultivate a Dialectical Materialist Worldview
    In mankind's living environment, it is full of vivid examples of dialectical materialism. In terms of astronomical common sense (generally included in the scope of physical geography), students can be told that the universe is full of developing and changing matter, and "absolute vacuum" exists only in concept. Different formation conditions (including different constituent elements) and different development processes divide the types of celestial bodies. In physical geography, students can be told that the growth of plants is organically and closely related to conditions such as terrain, soil, temperature, humidity, and cultivation methods; and the mutual relationships and the individuality of plants are variable. Haven't you long heard that the great Soviet agricultural scientist Michurin created many new seeds that meet human requirements? These new species have overcome climatic restrictions and expanded the area of human habitation. Rocks gradually turn into soil through weathering, which is a process from gradual change to sudden change, from quantitative change to qualitative change. Climate zone boundaries and plant planting zone boundaries are actually "boundary zones" rather than "boundary lines." The boundary zone is the reconciliation or transition area of two different scenes, and it simultaneously possesses the properties of two different regions. In political and economic geography, students can be told that due to the birth of the socialist Soviet Union, the earth is divided into two worlds, and this new world was conceived by the old world. Due to the decay of the old world, the new world accepted the historical task and was born and will replace the entire old world. The solution to the sins and contradictions of capitalist society has only one path: "to be replaced by a socialist society."
    Subjectivity and dogma lack a market in geography. If you say that the long ice age is a disadvantage of the river, it immediately tells you that the ice age of the rivers in Northeast China provides a lot of convenience for transportation on both sides of the river. If you say that rainwater is a treasure in agriculture, it immediately tells you that in the orchards of Xinjiang, any small rain will reduce the grape harvest. If you say that mountains are not suitable for agriculture, it immediately tells you that the mountains contain rich mineral resources... From this, it can be explained that everything depends on time, place, and conditions, that is, whether anything is useful or harmful is evaluated by human beings, and natural objects do not consciously possess that usefulness or harmfulness (mankind must obey the laws of nature, which will not be discussed here).
    In short, in geography courses, there are sufficient conditions to complete the task of ideological and political education. Any revolutionary geography teacher must use all possible conditions to implement these political tasks. Only when we can consistently implement this task and achieve the desired results can we prove that we have become conscious revolutionaries and can proudly say that I am already a people's geography teacher. Whether or not ideological and political education can be implemented is the sign that distinguishes old teachers from new teachers.

　　人民地理教师怎样贯彻思想政治教育？
    孙敬之
  　一　反对“地理学阶级性小”的糊涂观念
    在许多知识分子甚至少数干部里面，存在着这样一种想法“历史课本必须改正，地理课本用旧的无大妨害。”或者说“地理课本只是改变一下观点就可以了。”这是不对的。实际上所谓观点，首先被阶级立场决定着，并且它绝对不是孤立的，混合在地理教材里，而是贯串渗透在一切方面。所以，理想从旧地理材料里面，把反动观点拿出来，好象从米里检沙子一样，剩下的便完全符合人民利益了，是不合乎事实的。
    即使许多旧地理学者诚心诚意的否认过去站在资产阶级立场上了，但是在他们的著作中，确确实实用各种不同的形式表现了资产阶级的立场。下面举几个简单的例子吧：
    （一）有一本最流行的旧地理书上这样说：“……间或有些不相同的区域合成一省，无非为调剂物力的平衡，迁就交通的便利，例如察哈尔的割河北旧地，宁夏青海割甘肃旧地，都是因为其他部份面积虽则广大，财力难以供给省制组织的需要。”究竟把原来河北省口北道十县划归察哈尔省，是为了使这十县的汉人替内蒙人民负担政费呢？还是要他们充作国民党大汉族主义省政府的支柱呢？或者是为了利用汉蒙矛盾便于统治呢？可以肯定，后者是真实的。前者乃是形式上的“菩萨面孔”。按一般的道理讲，国民党大汉族主义者抢占少数民族的土地，绝不是为了“赔本赚吆哗，落个买卖人”，而是要赚钱的。这种菩萨面孔正象商人一年三百六十五天高悬着“大减价”的幌子一样，事实上他们却有一个坚定不移的原则，“不赚钱不卖”，难道这不是事实吗？而站在资产阶级立场的人，无拘他自己意识与否，必然产生这样错误的认识。要想改正错误，必先改变立场。
    （二）我看到在国民党统治时代出版的一本地理书，上面主张“天下一家”。并且自称是“国际主义”；他主张“各国资源和市场也应公开为世人所共有”；共有的方法有三：第一，发展航空。第二，通商。第三，破除偏狭的念头与作风。我完全同意当社会主义在全世界实现的时候，或者在现在各新民主主义国家与社会主义国家相互之间，实行这三条办法是很好的。因为这些国家的本质决定了交换通商平等互惠的真实性。但是在蒋介石四大家族统治中国的时代，宣传“天下一家”是太早了。因为那时候的“通商”是以美国为对象的，由于美帝国主义的侵略性质，和中国落后并依附于美国帝国主义的政治条件——蒋政权，便使“天下一家”这一名词具有相反的意义，如果实现了就象征着世界各国人民，都变成了美帝国主义的奴隶。因此我们可以肯定，这种思想，绝对不是“国际主义”，而是地道的“世界主义”的先驱，他是站在美帝国主义立场上说话的，绝对不是站在人民立场上说话的，其作用只能增加弱小民族的奴颜，解除弱小民族的武装而已。
    （三）我还看到有些书籍，不仅宣扬了资产阶级的观点，而且把法西斯主义的理论也搬出来了。在某大学的一本政治地理笔记上，分国家为四期，即幼年、青年、壮年、老年。
    “１、幼年期——秉性和平，要求自存，如美国在一七七六年到一八○三年。
    ２、青年期——秉性向外侵略，对国际有威胁性。如一八○三年到一九一八年的美国。
    ３、壮年期——秉性保守，如二十世纪以后的英国。
    ４、老年期——纲纪废弛，为各国侵略的对象，如清末的中国。”
    这一套理论，绝不是什么“历史观点”，而是用历史发展为法西斯的向外侵略作辩护的。这种理论的创始者是李特尔（Ｒａｔｚｅｌ），他把生物演变的观点机械的搬到了国家机构上，后来法西斯分子吉伦及其弟子霍斯荷法所利用了。其实质是什么呢？一句话，就是“侵略有理”，就是把侵略者的屠刀，扔在“历史”先生的门口上去。比如说，青年期国家秉性都是侵略的，老年期国家，由于纲纪废弛才招来侵略。那就是说做“屠户”的人因为他是壮汉，被屠杀者因为它是羔羊，这不是希特勒匪帮的逻辑吗？
    更可笑的，他把国家的轮廓分为八种形态——近圆形、三角形、四边形、矩形、五边形、多边形、长条形、畸形——我不知道这样“深入的钻研”，是为了什么目的，要解决什么问题。也许其中可以找到这样一些规律，近圆形的国家必有“烧饼山”，长条形的国（如智利）必产面包矿。那真幸运的很，可是我只喜欢住在四边形的国家里，我估计那里会有用之不尽的臭豆腐，我最喜爱吃四方形的臭豆腐。
    （四）在葛德石著中国的地理基础（开明译本）他宣传着马尔萨斯的人口论，他主张用“节制生育”（和平的杀人名词），解决中国土地问题，他反对过早的爆发革命，居心何在，不必再费唇舌了。
    这一本书在中国影响很大，除极少的语句可取外，绝大部观点是反动的，希读者注意。
    这样的例子太多了，读者自己去寻找吧。
    二　用什么才能打开人民地理学的宝库？
    最近有许多人，希望很快的掌握科学的方法，批判并抛弃错误的东西，吸收好的材料，建设为人民服务的新地理学，这是很善良的。
    掌握科学的方法，须要采取什么步骤呢？能否象锁子上的钥匙一样，无拘什么人拿到手里，就会马上打开新地理学的宝库呢？我的答案：“有”。那就是首先“坚定人民的立场，提高政治理论，做一个自觉的革命者。”谁都知道“自觉的革命者”就是全心全意为人民办好事，就是把自己的生命、利害、情感和人民的生命、利害、情感结合在一起；在口头上这样讲是很容易的，但是做起来就需要经过一番艰苦的斗争。换句话说，只有当你的行动能真实的一贯的有利于人民事业的时候，才可以证明是站到了人民的立场上了。
    人民的地理教师，不能停留在山脉河流，统计数字的讲授上，而更重要的是政治任务与教学效果。他们不把教地理当做“吃饭咒”，而是把这门科学当作完成思想政治教育的一个工具。人民地理教师是在坚定的自觉的为人民办好事的立场上寻找方法，而不是从“概念”上寻找方法，他们学习新的方法是为扬弃旧的，而不是为了保存旧的，这就是人民地理教师和旧地理教师本质上的不同点。
    科学的方法，和立场、观点是联系的分不开的，因此一切不站在人民立场上的人，就没有可能和科学的方法结为亲密的朋友。
    三　在地理教学中应完成那些政治任务
    人民地理教师既是把地理课当作思想政治教育的工具之一，那么应当完成那些政治任务呢？我把几个要点写在下面：
    培养爱国主义与国际主义的精神
    我们所谓爱国主义，不是以民族主义为基础的，而是以国际主义为基础的。那就是说要站在人民的立场上爱国，爱人民的祖国，也爱世界上一切属于人民的国家。
    我们不应从“概念”上爱中国，而是用具体行动爱中国，从地理教师来讲，能很好贯彻思想政治教育，并且注意到教学效果，便是最现实的最需要的爱国行为。
    在地理上怎样进行爱国教育呢？
    第一、要使学生知道“我们祖国辽阔广大”，相当世界陆地十三分之一（南极洲未计入），和整个欧洲差不多。它有世界上最高的高原，在那里蕴藏着无限的铀矿和金矿，它有黄浪似海的沙漠，在新中国的建设中将要变成广阔的良田，它有世界产量藏量最多的钨、锑、铜等矿，是新中国重工业建设的基础，它有世界上产量最多的稻米、小麦、大豆、高粱……在新中国的建设道路上将要更加提高产量，供给全国人民享用。它有月球上天文家唯一的可以看到的巨大建筑——万里长城和世界上最长的人工河。它有世界上四分之一的人口，在毛泽东的旗帜下，获得了新生。它有四千多年的丰富的历史文化，在这里织造着无数英雄诗篇，记载着中华各民族的共同光荣史绩。
    第二、今天的新中国更加可爱了，因为它将要完全清除了封建主义帝国主义官僚资本主义的黑暗统治，使人民当了家。因为他使广大的农民得到了生活必需的土地，消灭了赤贫的现象，使农民锅里由糠菜团子变成了黄色的干粮。因为它使人人有事做，人人有书读，地主富农也分得同样的一份土地，参加劳动生产。因为它把各民族放到了真正平等的地位，互相帮助，携手共进。而更重要的是因为它为中国走向更自由更幸福的社会主义社会奠定了稳固的基础。
    第三、当一个新中国的公民也是很光荣的，因为我们在这一百多年的解放斗争中，产生中国共产党这支最前进的革命先锋队，找到了英明的领袖毛泽东，毛泽东就是光荣，毛泽东就是胜利。因为在新中国的建造中——苏区和敌后抗日根据地的建立——，中华儿女表现了无比的坚定和顽强，他们能视死如归，为了人民利益献出了自己的头颅，这是新社会中最崇高的道德。
    第四、我们应当利用一切地理材料说明，新中国建设的优良条件，让学生有这样的自信，胜利、光荣都是我们的。彻底清除资产阶级“共产主义不适合于中国国情”胡说的残余，启发他们热爱国家，必要时肯于为人民的新中国付出自己的生命。
    第五、要说明世界民主力量是无比强大的，它们至有世界人口的三分之一，世界陆地四分之一（仅指的新民主主义和社会主义国家；资本主义国家民主力量没有计算在内），他们团结得象一个人一样。中国人民大革命的早日胜利，是同民主力量一致的斗争分不开的，同时由于中国人民大革命的成功，也进一步的巩固了世界民主力量总的胜利。
    此外应注意的是利用一切具体的材料，揭发战争贩子的无耻叫嚣，加强对敌人的仇恨，这是培养爱国主义国际主义精神的另一面。一句话，促使反动的腐朽的旧东西早日死亡，新的进步的东西早日胜利。
    要指出人类是自然的改造者
    人是自然的一部分，同时又是自然的改造者，用术语来说，就是“人是自然的对立物。”在人民的大地理辞典上，是找不到“顺应环境”和“适应环境”的名词的，只有使自然符合人类的利益。更明确的讲，人类所以能繁荣到今天，是从不断战胜自然的斗争中求得的，在人类的曙光时代，洪水猛兽疾风暴雨时时刻刻袭击着人类的生命，疫疠饥饿也会造成大量的死亡，但是由于团结的精神，英勇的战斗，人类终于获得了自由。将来全世界阶级消灭以后，会展开更加广阔的向大自然进军的道路。
    在地理上有充足的实例可以说明，这样一个真理——人是自然的改造者。黄河长江自古当做“天险”，国民党匪帮也曾以拥有这样的天险而自豪，但是在中国人民解放军的面前，只要毛主席朱总司令一纸命令，“天险”立刻跪倒在人民的面前，这是很近的例子，想大家还不曾遗忘吧？
    在过去一般人的意识里，以为虫灾是“神虫”作祟，是不可抵抗的力量，是大自然对人类的责罚，反动的政府从来是不关心这些事，因此也就不会战胜这种灾荒；人民政府恰巧相反，它把推进生产关切人民生活列入工作日程的首要地位，在政府号召下，在人民的集中意志下，用自己的双手，消灭了它。
    “天灾”这一个字眼似乎也是不妥当的，我是一个“人杰地灵”的拥护者，因为“天灾”是可以被人类战胜的，而且必须由人类自己去战胜它。
    黄河流域所以是中国文化的摇篮，是华北大平原建筑师，亿万年来，它就毫不疲倦的，辛苦勤劳的，进行着这一伟大而艰巨的工作，甚至夜晚都不曾打过盹睡。同时黄河又是一个可怕的词儿，华北平原的人民，一致同意赐给它“中国忧患”的绰号，四千年来改道数十次（大改八九次），淹死了千百万人民，漂没了无数的田园牲畜。但是黄河拒绝接受任何奖惩，他叹息着念出两首打油诗。
    （一）
    辛勤修造忆万年，
    终将沧海变桑田，
    风吹麦穗波千里，
    五谷丰收笑民间，
    中国文化从此起，
    老黄流尽血和汗。　×　   ×　     × 　    ×
    （二）
    夏季到来雨连天，
    山洪暴发理当然。
    山水急，
    刮地好似拖拉机；
    无数黄沙送河里，
    携带泥沙真吃力。
    有心带到东海边，
    重量大，
    道路远，
    主观愿望难实现；
    千里旅途小休憩，
    这还不合情理吗？（它严肃的问）
    没想到，
    一夜沈沙平堤岸。
    我承认，
    泛滥改道确是多，
    不能把河道建筑到昆仑上尖可奈何！
    歌功颂德我不受，
    抱怨老黄实在冤，
    理由很简单：
    自然命令不许违抗，
    自然的规律不许乱。　×　   ×　     × 　    ×
    老黄很不高兴，最后又啰嗦了几句：“谁能说在雨季到来的时候，山洪暴发河水泛滥是不合理的呀！？”“谁能说在雨季到来的时候，山洪暴发河水泛滥是不合理的呀！？”………
    黄河泛滥和改道，是不能归罪黄河的，应当了解和掌握住它的个性——河水未征服前，“烈性似水火，吃人不留情”，一旦被人掌握住，它又会“恭谨勤劳，永不疲倦”，老黄的抗议是正确的。过去黄河灾害的发生，是要腐朽反动的统治者负责的。
    今后黄河仍然可能泛滥，那只能归因于人类控制自然的能力和目前中国的物质条件，因为人民政府是会以全力修治黄河的，事实已经说明了！
    有人继续的追问，难道人类一点顺应自然的地方都没有吗？为什么修铁路要在河岸平坦的地方，而不修在高山上呢？为什么一定在温暖的平原上从事农业，而不到南北极种植呢？我只能文不对题的回答：“这都不是顺应自然，因为这样做法，人类没有亏吃！”这正是人类掌握了自然——自然的规则（我承认人类一时一刻也不能离开自然，但人类有其主动性），利用了自然。
    培养辩证唯物主义的世界观
    在人类的生活环境里，充满着辩证唯物主义活生生的例子，在天文常识方面（一般的把它列入自然地理的范围内），可以告诉学生，宇宙间充满着发展变化的物质，“绝对真空”只是在概念上才存在的。不同的生成条件（包括构成要素的不同）和不同的发展过程，划分着天体的种类。在自然地理上，可以告诉学生，植物的生长，是和地形、土质、气温、湿度、耕种方法等条件有机的密切的联系着的；并且相互的关系和植物的个性都是可变的，你不是早就听到苏联伟大的农业科学家米邱林，创造出许多合乎人类要求的新种子吗？用这些新种克服了气候的限制，扩大了人类生活面积。岩石经过风化作用，逐渐变成土壤，这是一个由渐变到突变，由量变到质变的过程。气候区界、植物种植的区界，实际上是“分界带”而不是“分界线”，分界带就是两个不同景象的调和或过渡地区，它同时具有两个不同区域的性质。政治经济地理上可以告诉同学，由于社会主义苏联的诞生，使地球上分成两个世界，而这一个新世界是由旧世界孕育而成的，由于旧世界的腐朽，新世界才接受了历史的任务而诞生，并将要代替整个旧世界。资本主义社会的罪恶和矛盾的解决，只有一条道路，那就是“为社会主义社会所代替”。
    主观和教条在地理学上是缺少市场的，假如你说冰期长是河流的缺点，它马上告诉你，东北河水结冰期，给了河流两岸运输不少便利，假如说雨水是农业上的宝物，它马上告诉你，在新疆的果园里，任何一阵小雨，都会减少葡萄的收成。假如说，山地不适于农业，它马上告诉你，山地藏着丰富的矿产……从这里可以说明一切决定于时间地点和条件，也就是任何东西的有用与否，是被人类评价而成，而不是自然物有意识的具备了那种有用性和为害性（人类要服从自然的规律，此处不谈）。
    总之，在地理课程中，有充足的条件能够完成思想政治教育的任务，任何革命的地理教师，必须利用一切可能的条件贯彻这些政治任务。也只有当我们能始终贯彻这种任务，并且收到应有的效果的时候，才能说明自己已经成为自觉的革命者，才能骄傲的说，我已经是一个人民地理教师了。能否贯彻思想政治教育便是区别旧教师与新教师的标志。
