　　The First Batch of Vaccines from the Temple of Heaven Epidemic Prevention Center: Sufficient for One Million People
　　Staff Worked Day and Night, Completing the Task Three Days Ahead of Schedule
　　[Beijing News] The Temple of Heaven Epidemic Prevention Center in this city completed the task of rushing to produce the first batch of vaccines three days ahead of schedule and is now studying new methods to rush to produce the second batch of vaccines. After learning about the plague epidemic in Chahar Province on October 23rd, the bacteria culture room began preparing plague vaccines, carrying out the dilution and packaging of the stock solution. After receiving the task assigned by the State Council of the Central People's Government on the 28th to rush to produce epidemic prevention vaccines, all staff members were mobilized and worked with unparalleled enthusiasm. The amount of dilution was more than doubled compared to the beginning, and the production of new stock solution was started simultaneously. According to last week's speed, it should have been completed on the 6th. However, due to the staff's tireless work, the first stock solution dilution work was completed three days ahead of schedule on the previous (3rd) day. It is now undergoing testing and will be fully issued on the 10th of this month. In total, it took ten days to produce more than 2.8 million cubic centimeters of finished product, which can be used by more than 1.1 million people. At the beginning of this month, the production of new stock solution began simultaneously with the dilution. However, the manufacturing process requires two weeks, plus dilution, packaging, and testing, for a total of more than three weeks. Currently, all staff members at the center are studying new production methods to shorten the manufacturing process and complete the second batch of vaccine tasks ahead of schedule.

　　天坛防疫处首批疫苗
    足供百万人使用
  　职工废寝忘餐提前三天完成任务
    【北京讯】本市天坛防疫处提前三天完成赶制第一批疫苗的任务，现正研究新法赶制第二批疫苗。该处自上月二十三日得知察北流行鼠疫后，菌苗室即开始准备鼠疫疫苗，进行原液稀释与包装工作。廿八日接到中央人民政府政务院指定赶制防疫疫苗的任务后，全体职工即总动员起来，以无比的热忱工作着，稀释数量比开始时增加了一倍多，并同时开始制造新原液。按上星期的速度应于六日才能完成。但由于职工们废寝忘食的工作，使第一次原液稀释工作提前三天于前（三）日全部完成。现正进行鉴定，本月十日即可全部发出，前后共十日，制出成品二百八十多万公撮，可供一百一十多万人使用。本月初在稀释的同时即已开始制造新原液。但制造过程需二星期，再加上稀释分装与鉴定，共需三星期多的时间，现该处全体职工正研究新制法，以缩短制造过程，提前完成第二批疫苗任务。
