Newly Translated Russian Edition of Lu Xun's Selected Works
Cao Jinghua
Edited by Lu Guofu, Published by Shanghai Era Press

This is a newly translated Russian edition of Lu Xun's selected works, compiled by TASS Director Lu Guofu, published by Shanghai Era Press this autumn. It has over 330 pages, with numerous illustrations and is a 16-mo volume. The book begins with a full-page portrait of Lu Xun engraved by Ren Feng and an editor's preface. The book is divided into four parts. The first part is fiction, including eleven short stories such as "A Madman's Diary," "Medicine," "Storm in a Teacup," "The Eternal Lamp," and "Regret for the Past." The first story is "A Madman's Diary," translated by Qi Hewen, the current Counselor of the Soviet Embassy. Counselor Qi is not only an excellent diplomat but also a scholar with profound literary attainments and high literary expression. For many years, he has specialized in the history of China over the past century, including modern Chinese literature. Lu Xun's powerful writing style is vividly reflected throughout the translation. The other stories are translated by Bi Lienishen, Rui Lin, and Luda Kofu. The second part is essays, including twelve major essays such as "Preface to A Call to Arms," "The Silent China," "Reply to the International Literary Society," "We Will No Longer Be Deceived," "Preface to Self-Selected Collection," "Congratulations on the Exchange of Chinese and Russian Characters," "How I Began to Write Novels," "Reply to Trotskyists," and "On Our Current Literary Movement." Except for one essay translated by Ke Xiluofu, the editor of "Russian Reader," who has passed away, the remaining eleven essays are all translated by the editor Lu Guofu. Editor Lu Guofu is an old hand with extremely high literary cultivation familiar to Chinese readers, and a Soviet friend who has wholeheartedly admired and studied Lu Xun for more than ten years. The third part is letters, including thirty-one letters to Xu Guangping and others, translated by Ke Xiluofu. Regarding literary exchanges in the original letters, the editor has made extremely detailed annotations under each letter wherever abbreviated names are used, which is a valuable research reference. The fourth part is essays on Lu Xun, including Xu Shoushang's "Chronicle of Mr. Lu Xun's Life" and "Lu Xun's Personality and Thought," Zhang Tianyi's "On The True Story of Ah Q," Chen Yanhua's "Lu Xun and Modern Chinese Woodcuts," and Jing Song's "The Soviet Union in Lu Xun's Eyes." The fifth part is reference materials, including Xu Guangping's "Postscript to Lu Xun's Letters," Zhang Shuzhi's "Reading Lu Xun's Letters," and Lu Guofu's "A List of Lu Xun's Works and Translations."

In terms of illustrations, in addition to Ren Feng's woodcut "Portrait of Lu Xun" at the beginning of the volume, there are also three woodcuts by Chen Yanhua: "From Darkness to Light," "Lu Xun," "The Guide to Soviet Culture - Lu Xun," and two photos of "Lu Xun's Studio." These illustrations are all printed very beautifully, which was not available in previous Russian translations of Lu Xun's selected works.

As far as I know, when I first met the editor of this book, Lu Guofu, in Chongqing in 1939, he was devoting himself to Lu Xun's research in his spare time. After Mr. Xu Shoushang arrived in Chongqing, the editor invited me to accompany him to visit Mr. Xu and talked deeply for most of the day, talking about his plan to study Lu Xun and asking him to write articles such as Lu Xun's biography based on Lu Xun's chronology. A "Lu Xun Selected Works" published by the Moscow Soviet State Literature Publishing House in 1945 was edited by him.

This huge volume that has now been published is entirely a new translation from the past two years. The editor planned to publish this book in 1947, which was completed under extremely difficult conditions, under the brutal rule of the Kuomintang reactionary regime's dying struggle. However, its publication took place after the liberation of Great Shanghai. The editor said in the preface with infinite joy and high spirits:

"The heroic Chinese People's Liberation Army liberated Shanghai from the hands of the American imperialist running dog - the Kuomintang reactionaries. Lu Xun's mortal enemies have been forever expelled and eliminated. Now we can freely publish a complete collection that includes all aspects of this great Chinese writer's activities, but we have only now completed this collection that we planned more than two years ago."

In the plan in 1947, the editor wanted to introduce Lu Xun's important works that had not yet been translated into Russian. According to the editor in the preface, except for Japan, the total number of Lu Xun's works introduced in various countries in the world is still not as many as in the Soviet Union. What is the reason for this? The editor said:

"Soviet readers have a very high interest in the works of this great Chinese writer. This interest has been particularly strong in the last stage - in the decisive heroic battle to create a new people's democratic China.

"Our Soviet readers are not only interested in the famous literary works of the 'Chinese Gorky,' such as selected short stories, but also in his multifaceted creations. This is entirely reasonable. Lu Xun, a great modern Chinese writer, is the ideological authority of Chinese revolutionary intellectuals, especially the ideological authority of Chinese youth. No matter how many times you have read the works he wrote twenty-five years ago, you can discover new meanings each time, and these works will always arouse your fiery interest."

The editor continued to discuss that those works in the last ten years of Lu Xun's creative life were written under the constant bloody terror and persecution of the counter-revolutionary Kuomintang. Many of his works contain infinitely rich content in brief hints and in unfinished sentences, and now we need to look at many of his works with new understanding. "Only now have we fully revealed the meaning of Lu Xun's famous lines 'Fiercely browed, I coolly face a thousand pointing fingers, Head bowed, like a willing ox I serve the children.' This is - fighting for the interests of the people and completely opposing all enemies of the people." Therefore, he advocated that "blood debts must be paid with blood!"

"Only now, only after the decisive victory of the people's democratic revolution, can the giant statue of Lu Xun, a revolutionary and writer who has advanced with his people throughout his life and became the revolutionary and fearless warrior - the 'great standard-bearer of the new cultural army' (as Chairman Mao said), stand up as a whole. (Note)

"Only now has the infinite possibility of studying Lu Xun's extremely rich literary heritage been obtained!"

When introducing Lu Xun's works, it is often limited to his novels, and less attention is paid to things other than novels. In fact, "to correctly and completely understand Lu Xun's literary revolutionary activeness, ideological and political views, it is not only necessary to know his early short stories, but also his later essays, sketches, essays, etc. Various aspects of the study of Lu Xun's rich literary heritage make it possible for us to fully understand this great modern Chinese writer. The study of Lu Xun's creation helps us to more deeply understand the development of modern Chinese society, and the heroic struggle of the Chinese people for a new democratic China." Therefore, this collection includes many aspects.

From all aspects, this newly translated Russian edition of Lu Xun's selected works is beyond the reach of previous Russian translations.

Especially valuable is the "A List of Lu Xun's Works and Translations" compiled by the editor at the end of the volume, which is 26 pages long. In addition to the introduction, it is divided into six columns: one is literary creation; the second is satirical sketches and critical essays; the third is academic treatises, compiled and printed; the fourth is translation; the fifth is the Chinese translation of translated and revised Russian and Soviet works; and the sixth is periodicals compiled and edited. Under each book, the editor has made detailed annotations based on his meticulous research, even including the origin of the book title. This is very valuable material.

This Russian-translated Lu Xun selection is not only the best and most complete collection in Russian translations, but also provides the vast number of Soviet readers with good material for self-study or teaching materials when learning Russian in various parts of China.

When the Soviet cultural delegation was in Beijing a month ago, Mr. Lu Guofu, the editor, talked about the Soviet National Publishing House asking Fadeyev to compile and translate Lu Xun's selected works from three to five volumes. We hope that this plan can be completed as soon as possible. We also hope that Mr. Lu Guofu, the editor of this book, who has had the deepest exchanges with the Chinese literary world for many years, Dr. Fedelin in Moscow, Professor Pozdneeva, and Counselor Qi Hewen, who is now in Beijing, will organize the strength of literary introduction and shoulder the task of a living bridge for Chinese literature to go to the Soviet Union, and systematically and on a large scale introduce the excellent works of Chinese people's literature to the Soviet Union.

The former ambassador to China, Petrov, who died of illness in Moscow this year, said at a small banquet in Chongqing during the War of Resistance against Japan: "Literature and art are the reflection of the soul of a nation. The mood, expectations, and the entire spiritual life of a nation are reflected in its great literary and artistic works. The true friendship between two nations is based on the true mutual understanding between the two nations, that is, the so-called resonance, and literature and art are the mirrors that reflect the two great hearts of the two nations. Therefore, the work of mutual introduction of the literary and artistic works of the two countries is very important for the true harmony and friendship between the two major nations." I think these words are very important. Especially when a brand new page has been opened in the history of Sino-Soviet diplomatic relations.

(Note) Chairman Mao's original words are "…and Lu Xun is the greatest and most heroic standard-bearer of this new cultural army." (See "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" page 264) - Editor

### 新译俄文鲁迅选集

专栏：

　　新译俄文鲁迅选集
    曹靖华
    罗果夫编  上海时代社版
    这是三百三十余页，附插图多幅，十六开本的一部俄文新译的鲁迅选集，塔斯社社长罗果夫主编，今年秋天上海时代社出版。卷首有刃锋所刻的整幅鲁迅像及编者序。全书分四部。第一部为小说，内包“狂人日记”，“药”，“风波”，“长明灯”，“伤逝”等十一个短篇。第一篇即为“狂人日记”，为现任苏联大使馆参赞齐赫文所译。齐参赞不但是一位优秀的外交家，而且是一位文学造诣极深，文学表现力极高的学者，文学研究者。多年来，曾专攻中国近百年史，兼及中国现代文学。鲁迅的笔力，在译文中处处活现着。其他各篇为毕列林申，瑞林及鲁达柯夫所译。第二部为论文。内包“呐喊序”，“无声的中国”，“答国际文学社问”，“我们不再受骗了”，“自选集序”，“祝中俄文字之交”，“我怎样做起小说来”，“答托洛茨基派的信”，“论现在我们的文学运动”等十二篇主要论文。除已去世之“俄文读本”编者柯席乌洛夫译之一篇外，其余十一篇全为编者罗果夫所译。编者罗果夫是中国读者所熟悉的文学修养极高的老手，是十多年来倾心崇敬鲁迅，研究鲁迅的苏联友人。第三部是书简，内包致许广平等人书信三十一封，为柯席乌洛夫译。原信中关于文坛交往，凡用简名的地方，编者在每封信下，均有极详实之注解，这是极可珍贵的研究参考资料。第四部是关于鲁迅的论文。其中有许寿裳的“鲁迅先生年谱”及“鲁迅的人格和思想”两篇，张天翼之“论阿Ｑ正传”等三篇，陈烟桥之“鲁讯与现代中国木刻”及景宋的“鲁迅眼中的苏联”各一篇。第五部为参考资料。其中有许广平的“鲁迅书简后记”，章树之“读鲁迅书简”及罗果夫之“鲁迅著译一览”。
    插图方面，除卷首刃锋的木刻“鲁迅像”外，尚有陈烟桥木刻三幅：“由黑暗到光明”，“鲁迅”，“苏联文化的向导——鲁迅”及照片“鲁迅的工作室”两幅。这些插图的印制都非常精美，为已往俄译鲁迅选集中所没有的。
    据我所知，一九三九年起，我在重庆第一次遇见本书编者罗果夫的时候，他就于工作之余，致力于鲁迅研究。许寿裳先生到重庆后，编者曾邀我陪同他去访问过许先生，整整深谈了大半日，谈到他研究鲁迅的计划，并请其依据鲁迅年谱写鲁迅传这一类的文章。一九四五年莫斯科苏联国家文学出版局出的一本“鲁迅选集”，就是由他主编的。
    现在出的这一巨册，完全是近两年的新译。编者计划出这部书是在一九四七年，在极艰困的条件下，在国民党反动政权垂死挣扎的凶残统治下所完成的。而它的出版，却是在大上海解放以后的事。编者以无限欢快高昂的心情，在序言中说：
    “英勇的中国人民解放军，从美国帝国主义走狗——国民党反动派手中，把上海解放了。鲁迅的死敌永远被驱逐和被消灭了。现在可以放手出版包括中国这位伟大作家的各方面活动的完善的集子了，可是我们现在才仅仅完成了两年多以前所筹划的这一部集子。”
    编者在一九四七年的计划中，是要把直到现在尚未译成俄文的鲁迅的重要作品，作一番介绍。据编者在序言中说，除了日本以外，世界各国对于鲁迅作品介绍的总数，都还没有苏联的多。这是什么道理呢？编者说：
    “苏联读者对中国这位伟大作家作品的兴趣是非常高的。这兴趣特别是在最后一个阶段——在为了创立新的人民民主中国的有决定性的英勇战斗的阶段中，蓬勃壮大起来的。
    “我们苏联读者们，不但是对‘中国高尔基’著名的文学作品如短篇小说选等感到兴趣，而且对他的多方面的创作都感到兴趣。这完全是有道理的。中国现代伟大作家鲁迅，是中国革命知识分子的思想的权威，尤其是中国青年思想的权威。二十五年前他所写的作品，不论你读过多少次，每次都可以发现到新的意义，这些作品永远引起你的火热的兴趣。”
    编者继续论述着鲁迅创作生活的最后十年中，那些作品都是在反革命国民党的经常的血腥恐怖与迫害下写出来的。他的好多作品，在简短的暗示中以及在言不尽意的语句里，蕴藏着无限丰富的内容，现在是要用新的理解去看他的好多作品的。“只有在现在我们才完全把鲁迅的‘横眉冷对千夫指，俯首甘为孺子牛’这两句名诗的含义揭示出来。这就是——为人民利益而斗争，彻底反对人民的一切敌人”。所以他主张“血债要用血偿还的！”
    “只有在现在，只有在人民民主革命获得决定性的胜利之后，这位一生同自己的人民前进，而且成了革命的大无畏的战士——‘新文化军的伟大旗手’（毛主席语）的革命家，作家的鲁迅的巨像，整个儿站起来了。（注）
    “只有现在才得到了研究鲁迅的极丰富的文学遗产的无限的可能性！”
    一般介绍鲁迅作品的时候，往往只限于他的小说，而少注意到小说以外的东西。实不知“要正确而完全的理解鲁迅的文学的革命的积极性，思想与政治的观点，不但必需晓得他的早期的短篇小说，而且要晓得他后期的杂文，小品文，论文等等。各方面的研究鲁迅的丰富的文学遗产，使我们更有可能完全的理解中国这位伟大的现代作家。对于鲁迅创作的研究，帮助我们更深刻的了解现代中国社会的发展，以及中国人民为新民主主义中国而进行的英勇斗争。”所以这本集子包括了多方面的东西。
    从各方面看来，这部新译俄文鲁迅选集，是已往各种俄译本所不及的。
    尤其珍贵的是卷末编者所编的“鲁迅著译一览”，共二十六页。除引言外，分为六栏：一为文艺创作；二为讽刺小品与批评论文；三为学术论著，辑印；四为翻译；五为翻译及校订俄国与苏联作品之中译本；六为校编之期刊。每本书下，编者精心考据所得，都作了详尽的注释，甚至及于书名之来历。这是非常珍贵的材料。
    这部俄译鲁迅选集，不但是俄译本中最好，最完善的集子，不但供给苏联广大读者的阅读，而且作为中国各地学俄文时，自修或教材的好资料。
    月前苏联文化代表团在京时，编者罗果夫先生曾谈到苏联国家出版局托法捷耶夫约他编译由三卷到五卷的鲁迅选集。我们期望这计划能早日完成。我们也更期望多少年来与中国文坛交往最深的本书编者罗果夫先生，现在在莫斯科的费德林博士，波兹德涅耶瓦教授及现在在北京的齐赫文参赞等，把文艺介绍力量组织起来，肩起中国文学到苏联去的活的桥梁的任务，有计划的，大规模的把中国的人民文学的优秀作品介绍到苏联去。
    今年正月在莫斯科病故的前驻华彼得洛夫大使，在抗战中间，在重庆的时候，在一次小型宴会上说：“文学艺术是一个民族灵魂的反映。一个民族的心情，期望以及全部的精神生活，都反映在它的伟大的文学艺术作品里。两个民族的真正友谊，建立在两个民族的真正互相了解上，也就是所谓心心相印上，而文学艺术就是反映两个民族的两大颗心的镜子。所以两大民族的水乳交溶的真正的和睦，友好，两国文学艺术的互相介绍的工作是非常重大的。”我认为这话是很重要的。特别在中苏两国邦交史上揭开了崭新的一页的时候。
    （注）毛主席的原语为“……而鲁讯，就是这个文化新军的最伟大与最英勇的旗手。”（见“毛泽东选集”第二六四页）——编者（附图片）
