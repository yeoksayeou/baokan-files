Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 14th: TASS Moscow, 12th: The Soviet government newspaper Izvestia answered a reader's question: "What is the island of Taiwan? What role does it play in the plans of the American imperialists and their Kuomintang lackeys?" The newspaper wrote: The bankrupt Kuomintang clique and its foreign masters are using the island of Taiwan in their gambling plans against the young People's Republic of China and the national liberation movements of the people of Southeast Asia. The vast majority of the people of Taiwan were originally Chinese. During World War II, Taiwan was used as a bridgehead by Japan for its war against South China and Southeast Asian countries. Currently, the American occupation authorities ruling Taiwan are also using Taiwan as a bridgehead for carrying out imperialist expansion against China. American imperialism is taking advantage of the fact that a peace treaty with Japan has not yet been signed – this is due to its own mistakes, using various pretexts to not fulfill the Allied powers' decision to return Taiwan to China. Taiwan has become an American military base and a refuge for defeated Kuomintang reactionaries. All major sectors of Taiwan's economy are now entirely under the control of Americans. Americans own Taiwan's largest trading organizations, banks, and industries. Over the past four years, Taiwan has become a place where Kuomintang troops are organized and equipped with American money and American instructors. Now, the reactionary Kuomintang leaders have fled to Taiwan, bringing valuable property, foreign exchange, and gold. The newspaper also reported that new weapons have been shipped from the United States to Taiwan. Along with the expanded activities of American militarists in Taiwan, the so-called Pacific Pact plan has been greatly promoted, which is a branch of the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty in the Far East. According to the plans of the American masters of this group, Taiwan will be used as a supply base against the national liberation movements of the people of Southeast Asian countries. The shameful bankruptcy of the reactionary Kuomintang rule is clear proof of the complete failure of the American policy in China, which directly supports the most reactionary elements against the victorious national liberation movement of the Chinese people. There is no doubt that the new attempts by American imperialism to prevent the strong progress of the Chinese people will also suffer the same failure.

    台湾岛是怎么一回事？
    它在美帝国主义者及其国民党奴仆的计划中起什么作用？
    【新华社北京十四日电】塔斯社莫斯科十二日讯：苏政府机关报消息报答复读者的问题：“台湾岛是怎么一回事？它在美帝国主义者及其国民党奴仆的计划中起什么作用？”该报写道：破产了的国民党集团及其外国主子，正在以台湾岛从事他们反对年青的中华人民共和国和东南亚人民的民族解放运动的赌博计划。台湾绝大多数人民原来都是中国人。在第二次世界大战期间，台湾被用作日本对华南与东南亚各国作战的桥头堡垒。目前，统治着台湾的美国占领当局，也把台湾当作对中国推行帝国主义扩张的桥头堡垒。美帝国主义利用对日和约至今尚未签订——这是由于它自己的错误，利用各种借口不履行盟国关于将台湾归还中国的决定。台湾已成为美国的军事基地和战败的国民党反动分子的避难所。台湾经济的一切主要部门，现在都一律在美国人的掌握之下。美国人拥有台湾最大的贸易机关、银行和工业。过去四年之间，台湾成为用美国的金钱、以美国的教官组织和装备国民党军队的场所。现在，国民党反动头子逃到台湾，把值钱的财产、外汇和黄金带到了台湾。报纸还报道新的武器已从美国运抵台湾。与美国军国主义分子在台湾扩大活动的同时，所谓太平洋集团的计划大为鼓噪，这个太平洋集团是侵略性的北大西洋公约在远东的分支。根据这一集团的美国主持人的计划，台湾将被作为反对东南亚各国人民民族解放运动的供应基地。反动的国民党统治可耻的破产，乃是美国在华政策的完全失败的显然的明证，这一政策直接支持最反动的分子反对中国人民胜利的民族解放运动。毫无疑义，美帝国主义阻止中国人民强有力的进步的新企图，也将同样地遭受失败。
