　　Propagation methods of Populus lasiocarpa
　　Wu Chengzhang
　　I. Characteristics of Populus lasiocarpa
　　Populus lasiocarpa, also known as Populus tomentosa, and also known as "sounding poplar", is distributed in the Yellow River basin and North China. It grows very fast, the trunk is tall and straight, and the tree shape is very neat. The wood is fine and white, and it has many uses, so people like to plant it.
　　The tree species is dioecious. The ones commonly seen are male trees, and female trees are rare. Currently, only three are known to exist in Baoding. Its seeds also have weak germination power, and natural propagation is very difficult. Apart from root propagation, there are no other methods. Because it has the above characteristics, artificial propagation is necessary to obtain a large number of seedlings.
　　II. Propagation methods
　　Now, the methods of cutting roots, inserting roots, inserting branches, grafting, and inserting branches are described as follows:
　　1. Root cutting method: Although the natural propagation power of roots is very strong, without artificial stimulation, it will not propagate too much. It is necessary to dig ditches under large trees and cut off the roots, so that the effect of transporting nutrients is suppressed, and a large number of seedlings can be produced. This method is best carried out before the ground freezes or after thawing. In addition, after digging up the large tree, deeply cultivate the nearby ground, or dig many small ditches to loosen the ground, and more small saplings will grow. Therefore, there is a saying that "one poplar dies and a hundred poplars live." They grow very quickly. By the rainy season or after autumn, they can be used for afforestation, or left in place to grow into a naturally grown pure forest.
　　2. Root insertion method: After the leaves fall and before the ground freezes, dig up the upper roots near the large trees, or use the roots obtained when digging up large trees. Select roots with a diameter of about 5/8 to 1 inch, cut them into 7-8 inch lengths with a sharp knife, and the cut should be smooth and not injure the bark. Dig pits with a row spacing of 1.5 feet and a plant spacing of 1 foot, and plant the root with the small end facing down, inclined into the pit, with the upper end level with the ground. Fill the soil, compact it, and water it. When the ground is about to dry, seal a soil mound on the root, more than 2 inches high, to prevent winter cold damage and other damage. In the spring before germination, apply some fertilizer, and then flatten the soil mound, so that the root head is not exposed to the ground, and it can germinate and grow. After that, water and weed diligently, and in the autumn, it can grow into a very good sapling.
　　3. Branch insertion method: Take the current year's branches from the base of the large tree, or the branches growing from the roots. After the leaves fall in early winter, select branches with a thickness from pen tube to finger thickness, and cut them into 1-foot-long sections with a sharp knife. Bundle them into bundles the size of a bowl (the heads should all be facing one direction and not reversed). Dig a 3-foot-deep pit in the ground, and stack the bundles of branches horizontally, with the thick ends facing up. Fill the pit with wet soil. After overwintering and the cut heals, take them out of the pit before germination in the spring, protect them carefully, do not let them be exposed to the wind, and quickly insert them into the soil, with the thick end facing down, and only one bud exposed above the ground, making it face upwards. The plant and row spacing are the same as the root insertion method. Water diligently, and it can survive.
　　Another method is to ring bark the current year's branches between the White Dew and Autumn Equinox, removing 2-3/10 of an inch of bark every 8 inches or so. It is necessary to peel from 5/8 of an inch above each node's bud, so that nutrients cannot be transported downwards, accumulating at the bottom of each node, becoming tumor-like. After the leaves fall in early winter, cut off at the peeled area and insert it obliquely into the soil, with the top bud facing upwards and slightly exposed above the ground. The rest is exactly the same as the root insertion method.
　　4. Grafting method: Divided into three types: root grafting, branch grafting, and bud grafting:
　　(A) Root grafting method: In winter, dig up the small Populus simonii trees, and bury the remaining roots in the pit with soil. Before germination in the spring, dig them out again, cut the cross-section of the roots neatly, and make them bend upwards. Use a one-year-old branch of Populus lasiocarpa to graft onto it. If the root head is deep, use a longer branch; if it is shallow, use a shorter branch. When the graft is complete, it is best to have the upper end of the branch exposed about 1 inch above the ground. After grafting, cover it with wet soil, 2 inches thicker than the branch tip. After Grain Rain, buds will sprout, it is easy to survive, and it grows very quickly. It is a good way to update a Populus simonii forest into a Populus lasiocarpa forest.
　　(B) Branch grafting method: When the previously planted Populus simonii trees grow to a diameter of 1 inch or 1.5 inches, cut off the upper section of the trunk from the ground or 1 inch above the ground before germination in the spring, and smooth the saw cut with a knife. Then use a one-year-old branch of Populus lasiocarpa and graft it onto the top. It is easier to survive and grows extremely fast, surpassing the original Populus simonii in one year.
　　(C) Bud grafting method: The Populus simonii planted in the autumn of the previous year or the spring of the current year, when the tree trunk grows to the thickness of a pen tube from the Beginning of Autumn to the White Dew, graft the bud from the current year's branch of Populus lasiocarpa onto it 1-2 inches above the ground (T-shaped bud grafting method), and it can survive. The bud does not sprout in the current year. Sometimes, if the grafting is done too early or the tree is damaged, new buds will grow, but they are prone to cold damage and other damage during the winter, so attention should be paid. Before germination in the following spring, cut off the tree trunk 1 inch above the grafted bud, and the bud will grow. At the same time, completely remove the Populus simonii buds that sprout from other places, so that the nutrients are concentrated on the new branch of Populus lasiocarpa. In the same year, it can grow into a 5-6 foot tall sapling, which can be used for afforestation in the autumn. This method is simple and fast, and can propagate a large number of seedlings in a short period of time.
　　5. Branch insertion method: Divided into branch insertion and bud insertion:
　　(A) Branch insertion method: Before germination in the spring, use one- to three-year-old branches of Populus simonii with a diameter of 5/8 to 1 inch, cut into 5-6 inch lengths, as rootstocks. Graft a one-year-old small branch of Populus lasiocarpa onto it (using bag grafting and cleft grafting methods are both acceptable), and insert it into the soil, and it can survive. For mass propagation, level the ground first before performing the surgery, and then dig 8-inch-deep ditches, with one side of the ditch vertical and the distance between the ditches 1.5 feet. After digging, water thoroughly. After the water seeps in, perform the surgery, grafting and inserting simultaneously, making the cuttings stand upright against the vertical side, with one bud at the top level with the ground, and the plant spacing about 1 foot. Fill with wet soil, compact it, and avoid damaging the grafted part. Then seal a 2-3 inch high soil ditch. Around the Beginning of Summer, buds will sprout. After all the buds emerge from the soil, water again. If watered too early, the water will seep in from the interface and easily cause death.
　　(B) Bud insertion method: Between the Beginning of Autumn and the White Dew, use the buds from the current year's branches of Populus lasiocarpa and graft them onto the current year's branches of Populus simonii (T-shaped bud grafting method), grafting one bud every 8 inches. After the leaves fall in early winter, cut off 1 inch above the grafted bud and 7 inches below, and insert it obliquely into the soil, with the grafted bud facing upwards and level with the ground. After insertion, compact the soil and water, and when the ground is about to dry, seal a 2-3 inch high soil mound to protect against winter cold and other damage. Before germination next spring, apply compost, and then flatten the soil mound, slightly exposing the grafted bud, being careful not to damage it. Continue watering, and after most of the buds emerge, if Populus simonii buds occur, remove them immediately. This method is simple, easy to survive, and convenient for mass seedling cultivation.
　　III. Conclusion
　　The Populus lasiocarpa propagated by the above Populus simonii has the following advantages:
　　(1) It has a stronger adaptability to dry sandy land, (2) It is easy to survive, (3) It grows quickly, (4) The wood is clean and white, (5) It has anti-epidemic effects (it does not develop the disease of the tree trunk cracking and flowing red water).
　　The various propagation methods of Populus lasiocarpa described above are only preliminary experimental results. Currently, experiments and research are continuing, and detailed results will be reported later.

　　大叶杨的繁殖法
    武成章
　　一、大叶杨的特性
    大叶杨，一名毛白杨，又名响杨，分布于黄河流域及华北一带，生长的很快，树身又高又直，树形也很整洁，木质细白，用途很大，人都喜欢栽。
    树性为雌雄异株，通常所见的均为公树，母树很少见，目前仅知保定有三棵，他的种籽发芽力也很弱，自然繁殖，很不容易，除根孳生外没有别的。因为他有以上特点，所以要用人工繁殖，才能得到大量的苗子。
　　二、繁殖法
    现分切根，插根，插条，嫁接，寄插诸法，分述如下：
    １、切根法：根的自然繁殖力虽然很强，若不加人工刺激，也不会孳生太多；必须在大树底下掘沟，把根切断，使输送养液的作用受了抑制，即可大量发生小苗，此法在地冻前或解冻后进行最好。另外，或把大树刨掉后，把附近的地，深耕一遍，或掘多数小沟，使地面疏松，则发生的小树苗更多，故有“一杨死百杨生”的俗语，生长也很快，到雨季或秋后，即可利用造林，或在原处不动，而长成天然生的单纯林。
    ２、插根法：树落叶以后，地冻以前，在大树附近，掘取上层的根，或用刨大树时得来的根更好，选直径五分至一寸左右的，用快刀截成七八寸长，切口要平滑，勿伤皮部，按行距一尺半，株距一尺刨坑，把根小头向下，斜植坑中，上头与地面取平，填土踩实灌水，等地皮将干时，在根上封一土埝，高二寸多，以防过冬寒害及其他损伤。到过年春天发芽前，上些肥料，再把土埝摊平，勿使根头露出地面，即可发芽生长，以后勤浇水除草，秋后就能长成很好的树苗。
    ３、插条法：把当年大树基部，或由根丛生的条子，到冬初落叶后，选笔管至手指粗细的，用快刀截为一尺长的段，捆成碗口大的捆（头都向一头不可颠倒），在地下挖三尺深的坑，把成捆的条粗头向上平砌一层，用湿土把坑填满，经过一冬贮藏，切口愈合，至春季发芽前，由坑取出，妥善保护，勿使受风，急速插土中，粗头朝下，地面只露一芽，使之向上，株行距与插根法同，勤浇水，即可成活。
    又一法，是在白露秋分之间把当年生的条子，施行环状削皮，每隔八寸左右剥去二三分长一环皮，必须从每节的芽向上五分远的地方剥，使养分不能向下输送，积聚于每节的下头，成为瘤状，到冬初落叶后，由剥皮处剪断，斜插土中，使顶芽向上稍露出地面，其余与插根法完全相同。
    ４、嫁接法：分接根，枝接，芽接三种：
    （甲）接根法：在冬季刨去的小叶杨树，把坑内遗留的根，用土埋好，到春季发芽前，再挖出来，把根的断面切齐，使向上弯曲，用大叶杨一年生的枝条，接于其上。若根头深的时候，则用长些的枝条，浅时则用短些的枝条；接好时，使枝条上端露出地面一寸许最好，接后用湿土埋上，高出枝尖二寸多厚，到谷雨以后，就发出芽子来，成活容易，生长的也很快，为小叶杨林更新成大叶杨林的好办法。
    （乙）枝接法：以前栽好的小叶杨树，长到直径一寸或寸半粗的时候，在春季发芽前，由地面或地面上寸许，锯去树干上段，用刀削平锯口，再用大叶杨一年生的枝条，接在上头，成活更容易，生长的极快，一年能赶过原先的小叶杨。
    （丙）芽接法：上年秋后，或当年春季插的小叶杨，俟生长到立秋至白露树身有笔管粗细时，离地面上一二寸处，以大叶杨当年生枝条上的芽，接于其上（丁字形芽接法），即可成活，当年芽不发生，有时接的过早或树被损伤，也有长出新芽的，但过冬易罹寒害及其他损伤，应当注意。至翌春发芽前，在接芽上寸许，剪去树身，芽即生长，同时由他处发生的小叶杨芽也完全摘去，使养液集中于大叶杨的新枝上，当年即能长成五六尺高的树苗，就可以供给秋季造林之用，此法简单迅速，在短期间，能繁殖大量的苗木。
    ５、寄插法：分枝寄插，芽寄插两种：
    （甲）枝寄插法：在春季发芽前，用小叶杨一年至三年生直径五分至一寸的枝条，剪成五六寸长，作为砧木，上接大叶杨一年生的小枝（用袋接及割接法均可），插入土中，即可成活。若大量繁殖时，在未施手术前，先把地整平，再掘八寸深的沟，沟的一边垂直，沟间距离一尺半，掘好后，充分浇水，水渗后，再进行手术，随接随插，使插条靠垂直一边直立，上端一芽与地面平，株距一尺左右，用湿土填平踩实，勿损伤接部，然后再封二三寸高的土沟，至立夏前后，即可发芽，等全部芽出土后，再行浇水，浇的早了，水由接口浸入，容易致死。
    （乙）芽寄插法：在立秋至白露之间，用大叶杨当年生枝条上的芽，接在小叶杨当年生的枝条上（丁字形芽接法），每八寸长接一芽，至冬初叶落后，在接的芽上头一寸下头七寸处剪断，斜插土中，使接芽向上，与地面平，插后，踩实浇水，俟地皮将干时，再封二三寸高的土埝，以御冬寒及其他损伤，到来春发芽前，施以堆肥，再把土埝散平，微露接芽，切勿伤损，继续浇水，大部出芽后，如有小叶杨芽发生，即可摘去。此法简单易活，便于大量育苗。
　　三、结语
    以上借小叶杨繁殖出来的大叶杨，有下列几个优点：
    （１）对于干沙地的适应性较强，（２）容易栽活，（３）生长的快，（４）木质洁白，（５）有防疫作用（不生树身崩裂流红水的病）。
    以上作的大叶杨的各种繁殖法，仅是初步的试验结果，目前正在继续进行试验研究中，详细结果，容后再报。
