Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 14th: TASS, New York, 13th: The draft proposals of the 17th subcommittee of the United Nations General Assembly regarding the handling of the former Italian colony of Eritrea were reviewed by the Political Committee on the 11th. These proposals stipulate that the solution to the future of this region should be postponed again, on the pretext that the Political Committee lacks sufficient information about the area to make a decision.

　　The representatives of the Soviet Union, the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, and some other countries opposed the subcommittee's recommendations, believing that they violated the interests of the Eritrean people, whose demand is to grant their homeland independence as quickly as possible. The Polish delegation proposed an amendment to the subcommittee's draft proposal, suggesting that Eritrea be granted independence in three years, and that during this transitional period, Eritrea should be placed under United Nations trusteeship.

　　Soviet representative Arutiunian criticized the subcommittee's draft proposal and supported the Polish amendment. The Soviet representative pointed out that the subcommittee's suggestion that the issue of Eritrea's fate be postponed due to insufficient information was unfounded. These sophistries are nothing more than political tactics. Arutiunian said: "In fact, the crux of the whole problem is that the colonial powers have not yet reached an agreement on the redistribution of Eritrea at this session. However, they have reached an agreement on the redistribution of other former Italian colonies. The decisions passed by the Political Committee on other former Italian colonies have increased Abyssinia's concerns about national security." The Soviet representative concluded by saying that the Soviet delegation believes that the majority group of the subcommittee's suggestion to postpone the solution of the Eritrean issue is fundamentally wrong. The Soviet delegation supports the amendment proposed by the Polish delegation.

　　The Polish amendment was supported by Pakistani representative Zafrulla. He said that the adoption of the Polish proposal would satisfy the wishes of the majority of the residents of Eritrea. The representative of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, Kiselev, also supported the Polish amendment. However, the Polish amendment was rejected by the United States, Britain, France, and their allies. Delegations from 10 countries, including the Soviet Union, the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic、 Czechoslovakia, Poland, Pakistan, Yemen, etc., voted in favor of granting Eritrea independence and establishing an independent Eritrean state. Delegations from 14 countries abstained. Delegations from 15 countries, including the Soviet Union, the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, Czechoslovakia, Pakistan, Yemen, Afghanistan, the Philippines, etc., voted in favor of the section of the Polish amendment stipulating the transfer of a portion of Eritrean territory to Abyssinia, so that the latter could gain access to the sea through the port of Assab. Delegations from 17 countries, including the United States, Britain, and France, opposed this suggestion. Delegations from 22 countries abstained. The Political Committee passed, by a majority of votes, the subcommittee's recommendation to send a United Nations delegation to Eritrea in order to obtain more materials from the residents of that area regarding the future of the country. After a long discussion, representatives from Guatemala, the Union of South Africa, Pakistan, Norway, and Burma were selected as members of this delegation. The Political Committee decided to summarize the various proposals regarding the former Italian colonies—Libya, Somaliland, and Eritrea—in one proposal and submit it to the United Nations General Assembly for consideration. The subcommittee's draft proposal on all former Italian colonies will be put to a vote in its entirety at the next meeting of the Political Committee.

    苏波白俄罗斯等十国
    赞成厄立特里亚独立
    美英集团阴谋瓜分竟予反对
    【新华社北京十四日电】塔斯社纽约十三日讯：联合国大会第十七小组委员会关于处理前意属厄立特里亚殖民地的提案草案中的各项建议，已于十一日为政委会审查完毕。这些建议规定，这个地区的前途问题的解决，应再度延期，借口是政委会对该地缺乏充足的情报，不能采取决定。
    苏联、白俄罗斯共和国及某些国家的代表反对小组委员会的建议，认为这违反厄立特里亚人民的利益，因为他们的要求是最迅速地给予他们的祖国以独立。波兰代表团对小组委员会的建议草案提出修正，建议在三年后给厄立特里亚以独立，而在这段过渡期间，厄立特里亚应置于联合国托管之下。
    苏联代表亚鲁疆批评小组委员会的建议草案，并支持波兰的修正案。苏联代表指出小组委员会的建议中所谓情报不足而必须将厄立特里亚的命运问题延期解决，毫无根据。这些狡辩无非是政治手腕。亚鲁疆说：“实际上，整个问题的关键，在于殖民国家重分厄立特里亚的勾当在本届会议中尚未能获致协议。但是，他们对于重分其它前意属殖民地的勾当，则已达协议。政委会对其它前意大利殖民地所通过的决定，增强了阿比西尼亚对国家安全的忧虑。苏联代表最后称，苏联代表团认为小组委员会多数集团将厄立特里亚问题搁置不予解决的建议，根本是错误的。苏联代表团支持波兰代表团所提出的修正案。
    波兰的修正案得到巴基斯坦代表查佛鲁拉的支持。他说，通过波兰的建议将满足厄立特里亚大多数居民的愿望。白俄罗斯共和国的代表基塞列夫也支持波兰的修正案。但波兰的修正案为美国、英国、法国及与他们同伙的国家所否决。十国的代表团，包括苏联、白俄罗斯共和国，乌克兰共和国、捷克斯洛伐克、波兰、巴基斯坦、也门等，投票赞成给予厄立特里亚独立，并建立独立的厄立特里亚国。十四个国家的代表团弃权。十五国的代表团，包括苏联、白俄罗斯共和国、乌克兰共和国、捷克斯洛伐克、巴基斯坦、也门、阿富汗、菲律宾等等，投票赞成波兰修正案中关于规定将厄立特里亚的一部分领土转让予阿比西尼亚，使后者能获得通过阿萨布港的出海通路的一节。十七国的代表团，包括美国、英国及法国反对这项建议。二十二国的代表团弃权。政委会以多数的票数通过了小组委员会关于派遣联合国代表团前往厄立特里亚，以期自该地居民之中获取更多关于这个国家前途的材料的建议。讨论了许久的结果是：危地马拉、南非联邦、巴基斯坦、挪威及缅甸的代表被选出为这个代表团的团员。政委会决定将关于前意属殖民地——利比亚、索马利兰及厄立特里亚——的各种建议，归纳在一个提案里面，提交联合国大会考虑。小组委员会对全部前意属殖民地的提案草案，将于下次政委会会议中整个地提付表决。
