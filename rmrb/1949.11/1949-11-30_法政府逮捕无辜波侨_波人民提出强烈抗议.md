Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 29th: The Polish Press Agency reports that Polish Foreign Ministry spokesman Grosz stated to reporters on the 25th that the French government is using horrific violence to mistreat innocent Polish citizens within France, which has aroused the anger of righteous public opinion worldwide. French police searched the Polish consulate in Lille and arrested the consulate's Chargé d'affaires, Baruczak. In Paris, the wife of the Polish embassy watchman,塔尔齐夫斯卡 (Tarczyfska), was arrested. In Marseilles, Polish consulate employee 比姆勒 (Bimler) and his wife and children, as well as consulate employee 吉那马 (Jinama), were arrested. Polish expatriate community leader 杜杰克 (Dujek) was arrested in Lyon. In order to deceive the people, the French authorities issued absurd and unfounded communiqués, making groundless accusations against various Polish groups. It is learned from this communiqué that a considerable number of Poles have been arrested by the French authorities and secretly expelled from France, including 科瓦尔斯基 (Kowalski), an official of the Polish Embassy in France. However, if a single word in the French government's communiqué is true, or if the French government can produce evidence of the crimes committed by the arrested Polish hostages, the French government would certainly not be afraid to publish this evidence in French courts, as Poland will hold trials for recently arrested French spies. The French government arrested innocent people, so it dared not try them in court, but secretly expelled them. At the same time, the French government has resorted to means unheard of in democratic and civilized countries, actually taking the wives and children of Polish citizens as hostages, a fact that has been brought to the attention of the world by Polish citizens recently expelled from France.

The Polish people are extremely indignant at France's violation of the fundamental principles of international law and its police terror. The Central Council of Polish Trade Unions sent a letter to the French Prime Minister, and the Central Committee of the Polish Writers' Association sent a letter to French President Auriol, lodging strong protests. The people of Warsaw gathered on the 25th and, in a surge of anger, passed a resolution strongly protesting to France.

　　法政府逮捕无辜波侨
  　波人民提出强烈抗议
    【新华社北京二十九日电】波兰通讯社讯：波兰外交部发言人格罗兹二十五日对记者发表谈话称，法国政府正以恐怖暴行虐害法境无辜的波兰公民，此事已引起全世界正直舆论的愤怒。法国警察搜查了驻里尔的波兰领事馆，并逮捕领事馆的代办巴鲁查克。在巴黎，波兰大使馆看守人的妻子塔尔齐夫斯卡被捕。在马赛，波兰领事馆雇员比姆勒和他的妻儿及领事馆雇员吉那马均遭逮捕。波兰侨民社会领袖杜杰克在里昂被捕。为了欺骗人民，法国当局发表了荒谬无稽的公报，对波兰人的各种团体加以凭空捏造的谴责。由此公报中得悉数目相当多的波兰人曾被法当局逮捕并秘密逐出法国，其中包括波驻法大使馆官员科瓦尔斯基在内。但如果在法国政府公报的控告中有一个字是真实的话，或者法国政府能够提出被捕的波兰人质犯罪的证据的话，法国政府一定不会害怕把这些证据在法国法庭中公布，如象波兰对最近逮捕的法国间谍将举行审讯一样。法国政府逮捕的是无辜的人，所以不敢在法庭上审判，而秘密地将他们逐走。同时法国政府采用在民主与文明国家中前所未闻的手段，竟把波兰公民的妻子儿女作为人质，这一事实已为最近由法国被驱逐出来的波兰公民诉诸于全世界了。
    波兰人民对法国违反国际法根本原则的行为及警察恐怖，极为愤慨。波兰工会中央理事会致函法国总理，波兰作家协会中央委员会致函法总统阿里奥尔，强烈提出抗议。华沙人民二十五日集会，在群情愤激中，通过向法国提出强硬抗议的决议案。
