　　[Reported by our newspaper] The number of retail outlets for grain, coal, and cotton cloth in Beijing has greatly increased, and the scope of supply is expanding daily. The Beijing Grain Sub-Company has added 24 retail stores since the 27th, including: Xueyuan Hutong, West Single Horizontal Second Street, West Huangchenggen, Baojia Street (all belonging to the Second Business Office); Wangzhima Hutong, 106 Dongzhimen Street, 10 Dongzhimen Street, Lipuying, Jizhao Hutong, Sunjiakeng (all belonging to the Third Business Office); Yangshi Street, Three Fences, Pinganli Jue'er Hutong (all belonging to the Fourth Business Office); Sanzuoqiao (belonging to the Fifth Business Office); Jingshan Zhishanmen, Xi'anmen Street (belonging to the Sixth Business Office); Daxi Hutong, Luanqing Hutong (both belonging to the Eighth Business Office); Shijia Hutong (belonging to the Ninth Business Office); Shangxie Street, Xiaxie Street, Nanheng Street (all belonging to the Eleventh Business Office); West Caoshi, Fuchang Street (both belonging to the Twelfth Business Office), etc. According to instructions from the Beijing Municipal Government, the company should add 100 retail stores, and 80 of them have already started operations.
　　Regarding coal: As of the 28th, the Beijing Coal & Iron Sub-Company has established 130 retail stores. Currently, each retail store only sells coal balls and coal cinders (i.e., lump coal sifted from coal dust). Retail prices for the past three days (26th to 28th): coal balls are 4,400 yuan per 100 catties, and coal cinders are 5,650 yuan per 100 catties. This is about 1,000 yuan lower than the private coal shops for coal balls and nearly 2,000 yuan lower for coal cinders (per 100 catties). Citizens are very enthusiastic about buying from the retail stores every day. Most retail stores can sell 3 tons of coal per day.
　　Regarding cotton yarn and cloth: In order to strengthen its retail business, the Beijing Cotton Yarn & Cloth Sub-Company, in addition to continuing to establish ten consignment stores, has also added a retail department at the south entrance of Wangfujing Street (the original Shanghai Company site), with more than 100 types of fabrics and cotton thread, directly supplying citizens' needs. On the 14th of this month, the company adopted the method of sending personnel to supervise private merchants to sell on consignment and established consignment stores in five locations: Sanxin East, Huatong, Qianyilong, Qiantailong, and Heyixiang. Subsequently, in order to expand the supply range, consignment stores were established in Yijulong (No. 28, front Guan Yin Temple), Shiyou (No. 116, Xinjiekou), Ruilongxiang (No. 280, north entrance of East Fourth North Street), Hengxingxiang (No. 10, West Single North Street), Yifengxiang (No. 201, Luomashi Street), Beijing Enterprise Company Store (Dongdan Archway), Zhenhua Company (East Fourth Archway), Farmers' Hostel (Langfang Head Street), Eighth District Cooperative (No. 151, Damochang), and City Supply and Marketing Cooperative Business Department (West Single Archway), and have been opening one after another. The sales situation in each consignment store has been good in recent days. As of the 27th, a total of 210,000 city feet of various cotton cloths have been sold successively. The company has also specially stipulated that cooperative members can get a 1% discount on the price when purchasing cloth at the City Supply and Marketing Cooperative Business Department, Farmers' Hostel, Eighth District Cooperative and other consignment stores, so as to facilitate the sales of cooperative organizations and the preferential treatment of members. In addition, the Beijing Department Store Sub-Company has recently shipped a large batch of printed cloth from Tianjin, Shanghai, and other places, and will begin selling it at the Wangfujing store on the 29th.
