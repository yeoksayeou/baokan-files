In order to truly become the people's armed forces and truly live up to the glorious and lofty title of 'People's Liberation Army,' we must continue to work harder under the leadership of the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission and the Fourth Field Army of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. We hope that people from all walks of life will provide us with more assistance and supervision."

　　军委会接受请求
  　对陈明仁将军所部颁予廿一兵团番号
    【新华社长沙七日电】中国人民革命军事委员会接受陈明仁将军及原中国国民党人民解放军第一兵团全体官兵的请求，自十一月一日起将该部番号正式改为“中国人民解放军第二十一兵团”。该兵团司令部特于二日晚举行晚会，招待长沙各界。会上陈明仁将军代表第二十一兵团全体指战员致词时，对中共的领导和解放军的帮助及长沙各界人民的关怀表示谢意。陈将军并指出：“我们今天虽然已正式称为中国人民解放军，但我们自己知道我们的进步还很不够。为了真正成为人民的武装，真正符合于‘人民解放军’这一光荣而崇高的称号，我们要在中国人民革命军事委员会和中国人民解放军第四野战军领导下继续更加努力进步。希望各界人民对我们多多协助和督促。”
