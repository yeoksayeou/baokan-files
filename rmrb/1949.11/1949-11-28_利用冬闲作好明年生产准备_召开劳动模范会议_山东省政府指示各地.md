　　The Shandong Provincial People's Government, in order to summarize this year's agricultural production experience and make full preparations for next year's agricultural production work, recently issued instructions on convening labor model conferences and agricultural production exhibitions in various regions, requiring all localities to utilize the current winter slack season to convene labor model conferences, production activist meetings, or old farmer symposiums, and agricultural production exhibitions. The instructions stated: Leading cadres at all levels should fully recognize that agricultural production has become the overriding central task in rural work. Universally launching production competitions, commending labor heroes and model figures who truly contribute to production, are creative, and have a driving and leading role, and popularizing their experiences among farmers is one of the most effective leadership methods for promoting agricultural production. The instructions stipulated: Old and semi-old areas with a working foundation and preparations can convene labor model conferences at the district, county, and administrative office levels; areas without preparation should convene production activist or old farmer symposiums at the county or district level.

　　利用冬闲作好明年生产准备
  　召开劳动模范会议
    山东省政府指示各地
    【新华社济南电】山东省人民政府为总结今年农业生产经验，作好明年农业生产工作的充分准备，特于日前发出关于各地召开劳动模范会议及农业生产展览会的指示，要求各地利用今冬农闲季节，召开劳动模范大会、生产积极分子会或老农座谈会和农业生产展览会。指示说：各级领导干部应充分认识农业生产已成为农村工作中压倒一切的中心任务。普遍开展生产竞赛，表扬真正对生产有贡献、有创造、并有推动带头作用的劳动英雄与模范人物，把他们的经验推广到农民中去，这是推动农业生产最有效的领导方法之一。指示规定：凡有工作基础和准备的老区半老区，可按区、县、行署三级召开劳动模范大会；无准备的地区则以县或区为单位，召开生产积极分子或老农座谈会。
