Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 14th -- With the severe winter approaching and autumn ploughing time pressing, various regions of Hebei are intensifying their autumn ploughing inspection to strive for ploughing the land once before the ground freezes. In addition to issuing instructions on autumn ploughing inspection, the Xingtai Prefectural Commissioner's Office, together with the Xingtai District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, also jointly dispatched seven cadres from various departments on the 30th of last month to form an autumn ploughing inspection team, which went to various places to inspect and urge progress. After in-depth inspection in the first district of Xingtai, it was found that the ploughed autumn land only accounted for 52% of the land that needed to be ploughed, and the unploughed land of poor villages and poor households still accounted for the majority. The main reason for the slow progress of autumn ploughing is the slackness of leadership. Some district and village cadres have blindly optimistic emotions about autumn ploughing, believing that this year the land is wet and easy to plough, and the masses have a high enthusiasm for production. After the deployment and mobilization of autumn ploughing work, no in-depth inspection and supervision was carried out, and the labor difficulties of poor farmers and the problem of plowing for family members of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel were not well resolved, resulting in the failure of autumn ploughing in some areas to be carried out in a timely manner. After the inspection, the district government has held separate meetings of village cadres and meetings of households that have not carried out autumn ploughing, in order to understand the situation and study ways to solve the labor difficulties; and it has been decided to carry out an autumn ploughing shock week to strive to finish ploughing before the ground freezes. The Zhuoxian County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party also found in the inspection that some village cadres relaxed their leadership, resulting in only 60% of the county's uncultivated land being ploughed. Some village cadres also had a bad style of forced orders, such as forcing households with livestock to plough for households without livestock without compensation. In response to the above phenomena, in addition to immediately instructing corrections, the county committee of the county has also gone to various districts to hold village cadre meetings to conduct inspections and supervision, striving to plough all the county's uncultivated land within ten days. Other counties in Hebei Province are also organizing forces and conducting universal autumn ploughing inspections.

    河北各地
    加紧检查秋耕
    【新华社保定十四日电】严冬将届，秋耕时间紧迫，河北各地正加紧进行秋耕检查，争取地冻前普耕一遍。邢台专署除发布秋耕检查指示外，上月三十日并曾与该区中共地委联合抽调各部门干部七人，组成秋耕检查组，分赴各地检查督促。邢台第一区经深入检查后，发现已耕秋地仅占需耕地的百分之五十二，贫村贫户应耕地未耕的仍占多数。秋耕迟缓主要原因是由于领导工作的松懈，部分区村干部对秋耕存在着盲目乐观的情绪，认为今年地湿易耕，群众生产情绪高，秋耕工作在布置和动员之后，没有深入地检查督促，没有很好地解决贫苦农民的劳力困难和烈属、军属的代耕问题，致使部分地区秋耕未能及时开展。经检查后，该区政府已分头召开村干部会议和未进行秋耕户的会议，以便了解情况，研究解决劳力困难的办法；并决定进行秋耕突击周，争取在地冻前耕完。涿县中共县委在检查中也发现部分村干部放松领导，致使全县白地仅耕了百分之六十，有些村干部还存在着强迫命令的坏作风，如强迫有牲口户无代价地给无牲口户耕作。对以上现象，该县县委除立即指示纠正外，并分赴各区召开村干部会议，进行检查和督促，争取在十天内将全县白地耕完。河北省其他各县亦正纷纷组织力量，普遍进行秋耕检查。
