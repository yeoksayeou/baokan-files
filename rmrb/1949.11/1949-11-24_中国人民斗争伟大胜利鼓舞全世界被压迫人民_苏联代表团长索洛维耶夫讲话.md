Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 23rd: The following is the full text of the speech by Soloviev, head of the Soviet delegation to the World Federation of Trade Unions Executive Committee, at the Beijing People's Celebration of the Successful Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference:

　　Dear Comrades!

　　On behalf of the working people in the trade unions of the Soviet Union, I extend to you fraternal greetings! The Soviet people and all progressive humanity warmly welcome the historic victory of the Chinese people under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong.

　　The crushing of the combined forces of internal reactionaries and international imperialism by the Chinese people and the establishment of the People's Republic of China have inspired all oppressed people worldwide. Comrades!

　　The Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference, currently being held in your country with representatives from fourteen countries, will undoubtedly play a major role in uniting the forces of the working class and consolidating the unity of trade unions in Asia and around the world.

　　The firm unity of the working class and all working people is an important condition for fighting against the imperialist forces that are trying to dominate the world and enslave the people of other countries.

　　The forces of peace and democracy are constantly growing and consolidating throughout the world. The people of all countries who are rising up against the instigators of a new imperialist war are standing on the side of the peace and democracy camp.

　　The great victory of the Chinese people is of historic significance. These victories have pointed out the path to freedom and independence for all oppressed people. Dear friends!

　　On behalf of the Soviet working class, I once again extend warm greetings to you, and through you to all the working people and all the heroic people of the People's Republic of China!

　　The people of our two great countries are linked by fraternal friendship, which is being consolidated and will be increasingly consolidated.

　　Long live the firm friendship between the working people of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China!

　　Long live the solidarity of the world's workers!
