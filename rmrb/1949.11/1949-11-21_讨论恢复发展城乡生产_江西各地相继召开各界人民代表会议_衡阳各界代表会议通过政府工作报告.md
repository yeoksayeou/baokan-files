Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 20th—After the complete liberation of Jiangxi Province in mid-September, all cities with a population of over 30,000, including Nanchang, Jiujiang, Ganzhou, Ji'an, Linchuan, Shangrao, and Qianshan, successively convened people's representative conferences at all levels in September and October. More than 30 districts in 21 counties including Nanchang, Fengcheng, Jinxian, Shangrao, and Leping convened the first district peasant representative conferences in mid-October. The people's representative conferences at all levels and peasant representative conferences focused on discussing the restoration and development of industry and commerce as the guiding principle for future urban work, as well as tasks and work steps in rural areas such as suppressing bandits, opposing local bullies, reducing rent and interest, production and disaster relief, and reasonable burden. Some counties and districts established preparatory committees for county and district peasant associations through peasant representative conferences, which further strengthened the people's sense of being masters of the country, thus greatly strengthening the connection between the government and the masses in the new areas, and enabling the work in the new areas to be carried out rapidly.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 20th—The Hengyang City People's Representatives Conference at All Levels was solemnly held from the 7th to the 10th of this month. This conference included 100 representatives from all strata of Hengyang. Mayor Mao Yuanyao made a work report on the second day of the meeting. In addition to summarizing the specific achievements of the military control commission and the municipal government in taking over work in the 25 days since the liberation of Hengyang, he pointed out the three central tasks of Hengyang City at present: First, consolidate the people's revolutionary order, assist the government in eliminating secret agents and bandits, reduce vendors and vagrants, and eliminate the black market for silver dollars. Second, restore production and promote thrift. Third, complete the glorious task of supporting the front line. At the meeting on the third day, Mayor Mao's work report was unanimously approved, and a resolution was passed to ensure the firm implementation of the three central tasks called for by Mayor Mao and to bring this call to the masses. The meeting elected Mao Yuanyao, Wang Qingshan and other nine people as members of the standing committee. Finally, the meeting unanimously approved the organization of the Hengyang City China-Soviet Friendship Association Preparatory Committee, and elected Mao Yuanyao, Liu Guoan and other fifteen people as preparatory members.
