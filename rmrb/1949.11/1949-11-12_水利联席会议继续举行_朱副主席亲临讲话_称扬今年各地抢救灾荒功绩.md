Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 11th. The Water Conservancy Joint Conference of various liberated areas, which opened on the 8th of this month, continued today. Deputy Prime Minister Dong Biwu spoke in the morning, and Vice-Chairman Zhu De spoke in the afternoon.

	In his speech, Deputy Prime Minister Dong first pointed out that Chinese water conservancy scholars and experts can only truly exert their strength with a people's democratic dictatorship regime like today. Deputy Prime Minister Dong said: In the past, under the rule of the Kuomintang, the technical conditions for developing water conservancy were much better than in the liberated areas; however, the results were not as good as in the liberated areas. After elaborating on the favorable conditions for developing the people's economic construction in the future, Deputy Prime Minister Dong called on experts and scholars to contribute their talents and strength. Deputy Prime Minister Dong said: The future of water conservancy work is infinite, but it must advance step by step. Today's urgent task is to gradually reduce the harm of water and gradually expand the benefits of water, until it develops to the point of being beneficial and harmless in the future.

	In his speech, Vice-Chairman Zhu pointed out that the Kuomintang reactionary government destroyed the rural economy, and used water as a weapon during the civil war. When they collapsed, they frantically and massively destroyed river defense projects and water conservation works for drought and flood prevention, thus causing severe water and drought disasters in various regions this year. Vice-Chairman Zhu said: According to incomplete statistics from North China, East China, Central China, Northeast China, and Northwest China alone, the disaster-stricken farmland reached 101.7 million mu, and the reduction in grain production was approximately 143,897,000 jin. Vice-Chairman Zhu then praised the achievements of water conservancy cadres and Party, government, military, and civilians in various regions in rescuing disaster victims this year. For example, during the flood season, when the Guan-Tai section of the Yellow River was in danger, the main cadres of the Yellow River Commission and all the engineering personnel and masses in that section were fully mobilized and continuously worked for twenty-five days and nights, finally turning the danger into safety. Vice-Chairman Zhu pointed out: There are countless heroic deeds like these in various places. Vice-Chairman Zhu pointed out: Today, the people of the whole country urgently demand drought and flood prevention, water conservancy construction. This meeting is to study how to meet the people's demand, overcome water and drought disasters, increase agricultural production, and do our best to develop hydropower, water resources, and develop agriculture, industry, transportation and other undertakings.

    水利联席会议继续举行
    朱副主席亲临讲话
    称扬今年各地抢救灾荒功绩
    【新华社北京十一日电】于本月八日开幕的各解放区水利联席会议今日继续举行，上午由董必武副总理讲话，下午由朱德副主席讲话。
    董副总理在讲话中，首先指出中国的水利学者专家们要真正能发挥自己的力量，非有一个象今天这样的人民民主专政的政权不可。董副总理说：过去在国民党统治之下，发展水利的技术条件比解放区好得多；但是工作的成绩都不如解放区。董副总理在阐明今后发展人民经济建设的有利条件以后，号召专家学者们贡献自己的才能和力量。董副总理说：水利工作的前途是无限的，但是必须逐步前进。今天的迫切任务是使水的危害逐渐缩小，使水的利益逐渐扩大，以至发展到将来做到有利无害。
    朱副主席在讲话中指出：国民党反动政府破坏了农村经济，并在内战中以水当兵，在溃退时疯狂地大规模地破坏了河防工程和造林蓄水等防旱、防洪工作，因而造成今年各地严重的水旱灾荒。朱副主席说：仅据华北、华东、华中、东北、西北几个地区不完全的统计，受灾田地达一万万零一百七十余万亩，减产粮食约一百四十三万万八千九百七十余斤。朱副主席继即称扬了今年各地水利干部和党、政、军、民在抢救灾荒中的功绩。如伏汛期间，黄河贯台段发生险象后，黄委会主要干部和该段所有工程人员及群众全体动员，连续抢护了二十五昼夜，终于化险为夷。朱副主席指出：各地象这类的英勇事迹，不胜枚举。朱副主席指出：今天全国人民迫切要求防旱防洪，兴修水利，这次会议就要研究如何满足人民这一要求，战胜水旱灾荒，增加农业生产，并尽力开发水力、水利，发展农业工业交通等事业。
