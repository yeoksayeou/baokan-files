　　The Second Session of the People's Representative Conference of Beijing
　　Resolution on the Government Work Report
    [Beijing News] At the third day (November 22nd) of the Second Session of the People's Representative Conference of Beijing, the resolution on the Government Work Report was unanimously adopted. The full text of the resolution is as follows:
    The Second Session of the People's Representative Conference of Beijing, all representatives, after listening to Mayor Nie Rongzhen's report on the government's implementation of the resolutions of the First Session of the People's Representative Conference and the guidelines and plans for future work, and reviewing the written supplementary reports of various bureaus and committees, unanimously expressed satisfaction and unconditional acceptance.
    From the closing of the previous session of the People's Representative Conference of this city to the end of October, in just two and a half months, the government not only further completed the three major tasks of consolidating revolutionary order, restoring and developing production, and developing cultural and educational undertakings, but also made significant achievements in municipal construction, public health, and social relief. Of the 171 resolutions passed by the previous session, except for seven that have not been implemented due to manpower and financial constraints, the remaining 164 have been implemented or are being implemented. This is unprecedented in the history of Beijing, and it truly demonstrates that our government is a people's government that is responsible to the people and serves the people. We would like to express our gratitude and appreciation to the Municipal People's Government and all its staff.
    In the future work guidelines and plans of the Municipal People's Government, the most basic task is to continue to mobilize and organize all the forces of the city's people to strive to develop production. We should actively improve business methods in all production undertakings that are beneficial to the people's livelihood, carry out labor competitions, encourage labor heroes and model workers in all production departments, and give them spiritual praise and material rewards. We should fully assist and urge the Municipal People's Government to actively carry out all work that is conducive to the development of production and the people's livelihood. Regarding the current issues of grain and prices that directly affect people's lives, we fully support the measures proposed in Mayor Nie's report, namely, opening up sources of grain, storing sufficient food reserves, severely cracking down on speculators and manipulators, increasing the number of state-owned grain retail stores, expanding the supply scope of cooperatives, and ensuring the necessary grain supply for the capital's two million people, and gradually achieving price stability in the future development of production.
    In his report, Mayor Nie also presented us with a new task, municipal construction. He also listed specific tasks such as tap water, sewers, environmental sanitation, and work relief. This is undoubtedly a practical and needed guideline. In the future, the municipal government should formulate a comprehensive plan with the goal of improving the welfare of citizens, so that our capital can be developed in a planned and step-by-step manner, and on the basis of production development, become a good environment suitable for living and working, so as to become a capital of the People's Republic of China that lives up to its name.
    We are deeply aware that we are facing an extremely arduous task. In the future construction process, we will encounter many difficulties, but we believe that as long as the two million citizens of our city unite closely, we will be able to overcome all difficulties and realize all plans.

　　京市二届各界人民代表会议
　　关于政府工作报告的决议
    【北京讯】北京市第二届各界人民代表会议第三日（十一月二十二日）会议中，一致通过关于政府工作报告的决议，决议全文如下：
    北京市第二届各界人民代表会议，全体代表在听取了聂荣臻市长关于政府执行第一届各界人民代表会议决议案情况及今后工作方针和计划的报告，审阅了各局会的书面补充报告，一致认为满意，并表示无保留的接受。
    自本市上届各界人民代表会议闭会至十月底，短短的两个半月中，政府不仅进一步完成了巩固革命秩序、恢复、发展生产、发展文化教育事业的三大任务，并且在市政建设、公共卫生、社会救济各方面都有了显著的成绩。对于上届会议所通过的一百七十一件决议案，除了七案因为人力财力的关系尚未执行外，其余一百六十四案都已经执行或正在执行。这是北京历史上所未曾有的事情，这真正表现了我们的政府是对人民负责为人民服务的人民自己的政府。我们谨向市人民政府和全体工作人员，表示慰劳和谢意。
    在今后市人民政府的工作方针和计划中，最基本的一项是继续动员与组织全市人民的一切力量，努力发展生产，我们应该在一切有利于国民生计的生产事业中，积极改进经营的方法，开展劳动竞赛，鼓励一切生产部门的劳动英雄与模范工作者，予以精神上的表扬与物质上的奖励。对于一切有利于发展生产，有利于国民生计的工作，我们都应该全力帮助与督促市人民政府积极进行。对于目前直接影响人民生活的粮食和物价问题，我们完全拥护聂市长报告中所提出的措施，即开辟粮食来源，预储充足的食粮，严厉取缔奸商投机操纵，增设公营粮食零售店，扩大合作社的供给范围，确实保证首都二百万人民所必需的粮食供应，并在今后进一步发展生产中，逐渐达到物价的稳定。
    聂市长在他的报告中，最后还向我们提出一个新的工作任务，市政建设。同时也列举了关于自来水、下水道、环境卫生、以工代赈等具体工作内容。这无疑的是切合实际需要的方针。今后市政府在市政建设上，以增进市民的福利为目标，应拟定通盘的计划，使我们的首都能够有计划有步骤地发展起来，在生产发展的基础上，成为一个适宜于居住、工作的好环境，这样才能成为名实相符的中华人民共和国的首都。
    我们深深地认识到，摆在我们面前的是一个极艰巨的任务，今后在建设过程中，还会遭遇到许多困难，但是我们相信只要我们全市二百万市民，紧密地团结起来，就一定能克服一切困难，实现一切计划。（附图片）
