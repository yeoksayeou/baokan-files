    Doctor Bethune is the Direction for Medical Workers in New China

    Today is the tenth anniversary of Dr. Bethune's death. We commemorate Bethune and learn from Bethune, not because his exceptional skills were unexpectedly brilliant, or because he was a foreign doctor, but because of his loyal and honest service to the people, and his immortal revolutionary spirit of fighting for the liberation of oppressed nations.
    He was a famous Canadian surgical expert. However, sympathizing with the liberation cause of the oppressed people, he traveled across the ocean, enduring hardship, had been to Spain, and came to China, racing about in the front lines of the anti-Japanese war in the Jin-Cha-Ji border region, bravely rescuing the wounded and sick, and helping the people in the border region. In order to relieve the suffering of the soldiers and civilians in the liberated areas, he forgot to eat and sleep, and finally gave his life for the people!
    Obviously, this is because he was not some detached doctor, but regarded himself as a revolutionary fighter, a Communist Party member, and an internationalist. He engaged in surgical work, not for status and fame, he did not take technology as a commodity to trade with the people; he used technology to serve the liberation movement of the working people, he willingly became a loyal servant of the laboring people, protecting the health of the people, and enhancing the combat strength of the revolutionary army, this was his only purpose in engaging in medical work.
    It is precisely for this reason that he embraced the great spirit of internationalism, abandoned personal happiness, overcame all unexpected material difficulties, sought truth from facts, and conscientiously and diligently treated revolutionary fighters and the people in the border areas. Wherever there were wounded and sick, he would rush to wherever they were; whenever he was needed, he would arrive. He had absolutely no airs of a great doctor. He treated the wounded and sick like his own brothers, putting their interests first, and everything started from their health, never considering his own personal interests, and his service to the people was completely unconditional.
    Due to actual needs, he also wrote profound medical theories into popular readers, personally educating peasant children, not disliking their low level of education, nor fearing their clumsy hands and feet. For the health of the soldiers and civilians in the border areas, he opened schools and cultivated a large number of medical talents. Under his patient education, the people in the border areas quickly obtained a large number of excellent doctors and nurses in a short period of time.
    The border areas did not have beautiful foreign buildings, let alone modern equipment, but these did not stump him, he never felt depressed, he highly developed creativity, converted temples into model hospitals, invented the "Lugou Bridge" pack mules to replace the Red Cross car, he overcame all difficulties. What is particularly commendable is that although he learned everything from the United States, he quickly achieved Sinicization in a short period of time, completely adapting to the actual situation in China.
    The above points alone are enough to illustrate Bethune's revolutionary qualities and his scientific spirit. And those capitalist individualists, selfish and hypocritical humanitarians, doctors who are irresponsible to the people, indifferent, talk empty theories, mechanically copy foreign things, take patients as experimental objects, sell technology to the people to earn money from their health, everything is for personal gain, full of foreign airs, and self-righteous—all these remnants of the exploiting classes are clearly opposed to him. It is precisely because of this that Bethune was able to obtain the sincere and enthusiastic support of the soldiers and civilians in the liberated areas, which is certainly not accidental.
    At present, New China is thriving, and medical personnel who have been infected by the bad habits of the old society are now entering the revolutionary ranks in large numbers. I think this year's commemoration of Bethune has even greater significance; undoubtedly, Bethune should become the best direction for our medical workers in New China to learn and strive towards.

    (Editor's note) "Lugou Bridge" pack mules: one of Bethune's creations to overcome technical difficulties. He installed boxes on the pack frames commonly used in rural areas to store medicines and medical equipment. Whenever he arrived at a place, he unloaded the pack, opened the box, and could immediately start working. This was very convenient for following the army. Because the shape of the frame was curved like a bridge, Bethune called it the "Lugou Bridge."

### 白求恩大夫是新中国医务工作者的方向

    白求恩大夫是新中国医务工作者的方向
    马丁
    今天是白求恩大夫逝世十周年的纪念日。我们来纪念白求恩，学习白求恩，不是因为他特殊优越的技术出乎意外的高明，或者因为他是个外国大夫，而是因为他忠诚老实的为人民服务，为被压迫民族的解放而斗争的不朽的革命精神。
    他是加拿大著名的外科专家。然而他同情于被压迫人民的解放事业，他不辞劳苦，远涉重洋，曾到过西班牙，又来到中国，奔驰于晋察冀边区抗日战争的最前线，勇敢地抢救伤病员，帮助边区的老百姓。他为着解除解放区军民的伤病痛苦，忘寝废食，终于为人民而付出了自己的生命！
    显然这是因为他不是一个什么超然的医生，而是把自己作为一个革命的战士，一个共产党员，一个国际主义者。他从事于外科工作，不是为的地位和名誉，他不是拿技术作为商品向人民交易；他是以技术来服务于劳动人民解放运动的，他甘心情愿地做一个劳苦人民的忠实仆人，保护人民的健康，增强革命军队的战斗力量，这就是他从事医务工作的唯一目的。
    正是因为这个原因，他才抱着伟大的国际主义精神，抛弃个人的幸福，战胜一切意想不到的物质困难，实事求是，兢兢业业地为革命战士和边区的老百姓精心治疗。什么地方有伤病员，他就立刻赶到什么地方去；什么时候找他，他就什么时候到。他绝无大医生的架子。视伤病员如亲兄弟，他把伤病员的利益放在最前头，一切从伤病员的健康出发，从来不考虑自己个人的利益，他对人民服务完全是无条件的。
    由于实际的需要，他又把高深的医学理论写成通俗读本，亲自教育农民子弟，一点不嫌他们文化低，也不怕他们的手脚粗笨。为了边区军民的健康，开办学校，大批培养医务人才。在他的耐心教育之下，在短期间内边区人民即获得大批的优秀医生和看护人员。
    边区没有漂亮的洋楼，更没有近代设备，但是这些没有难倒他，他从来没有颓丧过，他高度发挥创造力，改建庙宇为模范医院，发明“芦沟桥”的驮骡，代替红十字的汽车，所有一切困难他都战胜了。特别值得称赞的是他虽然学的全是美国的东西，但是没有多少时间就迅速做到了中国化，完全适合于中国实际情况。
    仅仅上述几点就足够说明了白求恩的革命品质和他的科学精神。和那些资本主义的个人主义者、自私自利的伪善的人道主义者的大夫们，对人民不负责任，不关痛痒，空谈理论，硬搬外国，拿病人作为试验物，向人民贩卖技术，赚人民的健康钱，一切为了个人打算，洋气十足，自命清高的这一切剥削阶级的遗毒，是显然对立的。正因为如此，白求恩所以能得到解放区的军民至诚热烈的拥护，当然不是偶然的。   目前新中国正在兴旺发达，曾经受过旧社会习气袭染的医务人员，现在大批的流入革命行列，我想今年纪念白求恩更有其重大的意义；无疑问的，白求恩应当成为我们新中国医务工作者学习奋斗的最好方向。
    （编者注）“芦沟桥”的驮骡：系白求恩克服技术困难的创造之一。他把农村习用的驮架，装制上箱子，内贮药品及医疗器械。每到一地，卸下驮子，打开箱子，立刻可以进行工作。以此随军行动，甚为便利。因架子形状弯曲似桥，白求恩称之为“芦沟桥”。
