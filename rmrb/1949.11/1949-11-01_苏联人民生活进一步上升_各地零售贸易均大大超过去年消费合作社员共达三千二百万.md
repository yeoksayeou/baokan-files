Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 31st: A summary of TASS dispatches: The communique on the results of the execution of the Five-Year Plan in the Soviet Union in the third quarter of this year announced that the retail trade volume in the third quarter of this year increased by 18 percent compared with the third quarter of last year. This figure shows a further rise in the living standards of the Soviet people. According to figures from the Soviet Ministry of Trade, the network of trade organs in the Soviet Union, especially in the restored areas, has expanded considerably this year. In the towns and workers' residential areas, which are being extensively renovated, 5,000 newly opened grocery stores and grain stores selling bread, fish, and vegetables, and more than 3,000 ordinary stores have been opened in the past twelve months.

The development of retail trade in Leningrad, one of the largest industrial centers in the Soviet Union, provides a vivid illustration of the rise in the living standards of the Soviet people. The sales volume of goods in Leningrad stores this year has greatly exceeded that of last year. The largest "Travel" department store in Leningrad sold 8 million rubles more goods in the third quarter of this year than in the third quarter of last year. Moreover, the prices of certain items have been reduced since March 1st. For example, the prices of cotton, wool, and silk garments have fallen by 30 to 40 percent.

The "Travel" department store sold 3.6 million rubles worth of clothing more in the third quarter of this year than in the same period last year, and people can buy better clothes, silks, luxury goods, furniture, and so on. For example, the sales volume of silks this year has almost doubled compared to last year, and wool fabrics have increased by 50 percent. There has also been a significant increase in the demand for jewelry, porcelain, fine porcelain, and furs. The demand for food has also increased. The 25 main food stores in Leningrad alone sold 50 percent more butter, sugar, and eggs in the third quarter of this year than in the third quarter of last year; 17 percent more meat and 14 percent more cheese. The consumption of wine, fine cigarettes, pipe tobacco, and the finest confectionery and other items has also increased significantly. The department stores in Leningrad are often crowded with customers. The "Travel" department store alone receives 25,000 to 30,000 customers every day.

Consumer cooperatives greatly facilitate trade between urban and rural areas. Consumer cooperatives throughout the Soviet Union have a total of 32 million members. Consumer cooperatives supply industrial products to rural residents and, at the same time, purchase agricultural products for towns and raw materials for industry.

In the third quarter of this year, the trade of consumer cooperatives has greatly increased in the production plan. The quantity of textiles, shoes, knitwear, and kitchen utensils sold to collective farmers has also increased significantly compared to last year. Rural residents bought four and a half times more sewing machines this year than in 1947, while the purchase volume of bicycles and motorized bicycles was twice that of 1947. The prices of agricultural products on the collective farm markets fell further in the third quarter, while the goods sold increased significantly.

　　苏联人民生活进一步上升
    各地零售贸易均大大超过去年消费合作社员共达三千二百万
    【新华社北京三十一日电】综合塔斯社消息：苏联今年第三季执行五年计划结果的公报宣布，今年第三季的零售贸易额比去年第三季增加百分之十八。这个数字表明苏联人民生活的进一步上升。根据苏联贸易部的数字，全苏各地、特别是恢复区的贸易机关网，本年已相当可观地扩大了。现正大事修缮的市镇与工人住宅区，在过去十二个月中，已有五千个新开张的售卖面包、鱼类、蔬菜的杂货店与粮食店，和三千多个普通商店。
    以苏联最大工业中心之一的列宁格勒零售贸易发展的情况为例，可以生动地说明苏联人民生活的上升。今年列宁格勒城商店货物的销售量，大大超过去年。列城最大的“行旅”百货商店，今年第三季比去年第三季多销了八百万卢布的货物。而且，某些物品的价格，在三月一日以后就已减低了。例如棉、毛、丝质成衣的价格下落了百分之三十至四十。
    “行旅”百货商店在今年第三季比去年同期多卖出价值三百六十万卢布的成衣，而且，人们可以买到更好的衣服、丝织品、奢侈品、家具等等。例如，今年丝织品的出售量差不多比去年增加了两倍，毛织品增加了百分之五十。对珠宝、磁器、细瓷、毛皮的需求也有显著的增加。对食物的需求亦形增高。仅列宁格勒城中二十五个主要食品店，只在今年第三季就较去年第三季多售出百分之五十的奶油、糖和鸡蛋；多售出百分之十七的肉和百分之十四的乳酪。葡萄酒、名贵纸烟、烟斗用烟丝和最好的糖果以及他种物品的消费，亦显著增高。列宁格勒的百货商店经常挤满了顾客。只是“行旅”百货商店一家，每天便有二万五千到三万人光顾。
    消费合作社使城乡之间的贸易得到很大的便利。全苏消费合作社共拥有社员三千二百万人。消费合作社把工业品供给乡村居民，同时，又为城镇购买农产品，为工业购买原料。
    本年第三季生产计划中，消费合作社的贸易已大大增加。卖给集体农民的纺织品、鞋子、编织物与厨房用具的数量，也比去年增加了许多。乡村的居民今年所购的缝纫机，为一九四七年的四倍半，而脚踏车与摩托脚踏车的购买量，则为一九四七年的两倍。集体农场市场上农产品的价格，在第三季中又进一步下降，而所卖出的货物却大大增加。
