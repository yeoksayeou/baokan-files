    【北京讯】Since the Beijing Tram Company implemented the responsibility system for train crews on the twelfth of this month, it has achieved remarkable results in terms of caring for vehicles and uniting employees. In October, the company averaged eighteen breakdowns per day. Since the implementation of the crew responsibility system, although the number of vehicles in operation has increased and passengers are crowded, the number of breakdowns has been reduced by half compared to October. In terms of ticket revenue, excluding Sundays, it was below 5 million yuan per day in October. Since the implementation of the crew responsibility system, it has been above 5 million yuan per day, reaching over 7.47 million yuan on the 20th. Previously, if the trams had minor problems, they would be sent back to the repair shop, and the drivers and ticket sellers would rest. Now, the drivers carry their own repair tools. When they encounter minor faults, the whole crew (one group divided into day and night shifts) unites and helps each other to repair the trams themselves, trying their best to keep the trams running on the road. Previously, ninety trams would be dispatched in the morning, and often only eighty-four or five would remain in the afternoon; now, often ninety trams are dispatched in the morning, and there are still ninety in the afternoon.

　　京电车公司实行乘务负责制后
  　坏车减少票款增多
    【北京讯】北京电车公司目本月十二日实行乘务负责制以来，在爱护车辆，团结员工方面，已获显著成绩。该公司十月份平均每日坏车十八次，自实行乘务员负责制后，虽然行驶的车辆增多，而且乘客拥挤，但坏车比十月份减少一半。票款方面，十月份除星期日外，每日都在五百万元以下，自实行乘务负责制后，每日都在五百万元以上，二十日并高达七百四十七万余元。从前，车有点毛病就开回修造厂修理，司机、卖票的就休息了。现在司机们都自己带着修理工具，遇见小故障就全班（一组分日夜两班）人团结互助，自己修理，尽量想法使车在路上跑。以前早晨出九十辆车，下午就常常剩下八十四五辆了；现在，常常是早晨出九十辆，下午还是九十辆。
