Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, November 11th: Farmer representatives from Hebei Province, who participated in the Tianjin Industrial Exhibition, have provided many valuable suggestions on how to further implement urban-rural mutual assistance and material exchange. During their stay in Tianjin, they attended座谈会座谈会座谈会symposiums hosted by Tianjin industrial and commercial circles, the North China Foreign Trade Administration, and various state-owned specialized companies dealing in North China hog bristles, egg products, native products, oils, fur, and general merchandise. Many farmer representatives believe that what farmers need most urgently are farm tools, especially improved simple and scientific farm tools, such as plows, iron hoes, waterwheels, manual cotton presses, and oil presses. Farmers also need cities to supply large quantities of cheap fertilizer powder, insecticides, insecticide sprayers, and daily necessities such as kerosene, matches, and dyes.

The farmer representatives stated that the matches currently produced in the city are not all usable. The quality of rubber shoes is not very good, and the prices are high. The effectiveness of "666" insecticide is not great enough, and the price of fertilizer powder is too expensive. The quality of other products, such as sodium sulfide, is also poor. All of these affect the sales of products in rural areas. Therefore, it is necessary to quickly improve product quality and reduce costs. Especially for fertilizers such as fertilizer powder and bone meal, if the industrial sector can plan to go to the countryside to collect raw materials such as cattle bones and sheep bones, the product cost will definitely be reduced.

The farmer representatives also pointed out that the work of purchasing local products has not yet penetrated into rural areas, resulting in great losses. For example, Cangxian's red dates, pears, black beans, and straw braid, Tangshan's hog bristles and cotton, and Xingtai's fur and mountain products all urgently need someone to purchase them. The fruits produced in Linyu County, Tangshan Prefecture, are wasted a lot because no one buys them. In Handan Prefecture, the export native product, pepper, is not purchased, and farmers are cutting down the trees. In Hengshui Prefecture, no one wants the produced saltpeter and fire saltpeter. Tangshan's reeds are all burned as firewood. In some places in Xushui County, hog bristles are even used as fertilizer. The purchase of pig intestines and sheep intestines is also not common enough. The Hengshui Prefecture Supply and Marketing Cooperative has collected casings, but does not understand how to preserve them, so some even rot. These examples all show that state-owned trade departments and exporters have not been able to go deep into rural areas to make purchases.

The representatives all hope that state-owned trade departments and exporters can go to the countryside to purchase these useful materials in large quantities. Some farmer representatives also proposed establishing a permanent organization for the exchange of urban and rural materials to truly achieve urban-rural mutual assistance. Now, the Tianjin Municipal People's Government Industry and Commerce Bureau and Tianjin industrial and commercial figures have accepted the opinions of the farmer representatives and are preparing to establish an agency to closely link urban and rural areas.

    参加天津工展河北农民代表
    提供城乡互助意见
    农村迫切需要新式简便农具
    工业品要提高质量减低成本
    【新华社天津十一日电】参观天津工业展览会的河北省农民代表，对于如何进一步实行城乡互助、物资交流，提供了许多宝贵的意见。他们在留津期间，曾经分别出席天津工商业界、华北对外贸易管理局和华北猪鬃、蛋品、土产、油脂、皮毛、百货等各国营专业公司所主持的座谈会。许多农民代表认为农民最迫切需要的是农具，特别是经过改良的简单科学的农具，如犁、铁铣、水车、人力压棉机、榨油机等。农民们也需要城市供应大量的廉价肥田粉、杀虫剂、杀虫喷雾器和煤油、火柴、染料等日常用品。农民代表们表示，目前城市生产出来的火柴，不能根根顶用。胶鞋的质量不很好，价钱又高。“六六六”杀虫药剂效能不够大，肥田粉的价格也太贵，其他如硫化青等产品，质量也较差。所有这些，都影响了产品在农村的销路。因此，必须迅速提高产品质量，降低成本。尤其是肥田粉、骨粉等肥料，如果工业界能有计划地下乡去收集牛骨、羊骨等原料，则产品成本一定会降低。农民代表们又指出，土产收购工作，还没有深入农村，因而招致了很大的损失。如沧县的红枣、梨、黑豆、草帽辫，唐山的猪鬃、棉花、邢台的皮毛、山货等等，都亟需有人去收购。唐山专区临榆县所出的水果，因无人收购，浪费很多。邯郸专区的出口土产花椒，因无人收买，农民们把树都砍掉了。衡水专区出产的皮硝、火硝竟没有人要。唐山的苇子全做了柴烧。徐水县有的地方竟把猪鬃当做肥料使用。猪肠、羊肠的收购也不够普遍。衡水专区供销合作总社曾收集过肠衣，但不懂保存方法，因此有的竟至腐烂。这些例子都说明国营贸易部门及出口商，还未能深入农村进行收购。代表们都希望国营贸易部门及出口商能到农村去大量收购这些有用的物资。有些农民代表还提出建立一个经常交流城乡物资的机构，真正做到城乡互助。现在天津人民政府工商局和天津工商界人士，已接受农民代表的意见，正在筹备建立密切城乡联系的机构。
