　　Rapid Development of Adult Education in Beijing
　　Remedial Schools Reach 100 Locations
　　Textbook Problem Urgent
    [Beijing News] Adult education in Beijing has developed rapidly over the past three months. There are now 101 adult remedial schools, with a total of 174 classes and 6,198 students. At the first All-Circles Representative Conference held in mid-August, a resolution was made to develop adult education and universally establish adult remedial schools. Comrade Peng Zhen pointed out in his concluding report to the conference: "The provision of cultural and remedial education for adults should be given the same importance as school education." This instruction was immediately and enthusiastically supported and earnestly implemented by the Beijing Municipal People's Government and various people's organizations such as the Educational Workers Union, the Women's Federation, and the Student Federation. After the resolution of the All-Circles Representative Conference was universally communicated in all districts at the end of August, adult remedial schools were universally established in each district. By the end of September, the number of classes had increased from the original 30-plus to 81, with over 2,000 students. In October, the number increased to 131 classes, with 4,764 students. Now there are a total of 101 locations, 174 classes, and 6,198 students. The students of the adult remedial schools are mainly vendors, small merchants, housewives, unemployed intellectuals, and some scattered workers. The main courses in the schools are political studies and cultural remedial studies. Almost every school offers courses in Chinese, general knowledge (natural hygiene and historical and geographical knowledge), politics, and arithmetic. Classes are held from three to six days a week, with each class lasting two hours. Most of the teachers are middle school students and primary and secondary school teachers. The school sites are also located in middle schools or primary schools. The organization and leadership of these schools are mainly the responsibility of the Municipal Education Bureau and the cultural and educational sections of each district, who organize primary and secondary school teachers and students and use the equipment and facilities of primary and secondary schools to run adult remedial schools. The biggest problem in adult remedial schools now is the widespread lack of cultural and political textbooks suitable for adult education. Proper resolution of this problem will enable adult remedial education to be better developed.

　　京市成人教育发展迅速
　　补习学校已达百处
　　教材问题亟须解决
    【北京讯】北京市的成人教育三个月来获得迅速发展，现在已有成人补习学校一百零一处，共一百七十四班，学生六千一百九十八人。在八月中举行的第一届各界代表会议上，曾作出决议，要开展成人教育，普遍设立成人补习学校。彭真同志在会议总结报告中指出：“开办成年人文化教育补习教育，要和学校教育一样的重视。”这一指示，立即得到北京市人民政府及各人民团体如教联、妇联、学联等的热烈拥护和切实执行。八月底各区普遍传达了各界代表会议的决议之后，成人补习学校就在各区普遍成立起来。九月底就从原有的三十余个班增加到八十一个班，学生二千余人。十月份增到一百三十一个班，四千七百六十四人。现在共一百零一处，一百七十四班，六千一百九十八人。成人补习学校的学生，主要是摊贩、小商贩、家庭妇女、失学失业的知识分子和一部分零散的工人。学校里的主要课程是学习政治和补习文化。差不多每个学校都设有国文、常识（自然卫生及史地常识）政治及算术。每周上课自三天至六天不等，每次上课二小时。教员大部分是中学的学生和中小学的教职员。校址也就设在中学或者小学里。这些学校的组织领导，主要是市教育局和各区的文教科，通过他们把各区中小学教职员和学生组织起来，利用中小学的设备条件，开办成人补习学校。现在成人补习学校中最大的问题，是普遍缺乏适合于成人教育用的文化教材和政治教材。这一问题能获得适当的解决，将会使成人补习教育得到更好的开展。
