　　[Beijing News] The work of preventing plague in the city has gradually entered a deeper stage. The Health Department of the North China Military Region, the Beijing Municipal Health Bureau, and Peking University Hospital have organized an anti-epidemic team consisting of sixty doctors and one hundred and seventy nurses. Under the unified leadership of the Municipal Epidemic Prevention Committee, they will depart immediately to work on the blockade line from Dongba Town to Liulichang and at the city and suburban quarantine stations. The frontline blockade work is very solid. Travelers and livestock coming to Beijing from Zhangjiakou, Chahar Province, have been prohibited since October 27th and 28th. Those who detour are subject to strict quarantine and disinfection according to the regulations of the Central Epidemic Prevention Committee, and are also subject to ten to fourteen days of isolation. Within the municipal area, epidemic prevention sub-committees have been established in each urban and suburban district to direct the district's cleaning, epidemic prevention, publicity, blockade, and intelligence work related to plague prevention. Starting next week, a citywide clean-up and rat eradication campaign will be launched. Publicity teams organized by Peking University Hospital and various art troupes will also conduct publicity activities in various districts simultaneously. The work of universally vaccinating citizens throughout the city is also gradually being carried out.
    However, the plague in Chahar Province continues to spread, and the possibility of it invading the capital still exists. Furthermore, citizens in the city still have various biases in their understanding of epidemic prevention. To this end, Zhang Wenqi, Deputy Director of the Municipal Epidemic Prevention Committee, specifically pointed out two issues that should be emphasized in the current epidemic prevention work: First, he called on all medical personnel in the city to unconditionally participate in the epidemic prevention work, whether in times of epidemic tension or during the prevention stage. Today's plague prevention is an urgent combat task for the people of North China, and every medical worker has the obligation to participate in and lead the masses to resolutely complete this task. Every medical worker should also seize this opportunity to test whether they have established a new attitude towards medical work and whether they are willing to use their skills to serve the people. Second, he pointed out that it is very good that citizens in the city report matters to the Epidemic Prevention Committee, but the phenomenon of panic is still very serious. For example, yesterday a private primary school suddenly rumored that two students from Xin Sheng Middle School had died of plague during morning exercises, and at noon it was rumored that Xin Sheng Middle School had been closed and blockaded, so everyone immediately started complaining of headaches and fever. This is very bad. Replacing effective prevention work with panic will not only fail to prevent the spread of the plague, but will also expand it. Moreover, it is especially important to note that: while we must be vigilant against the invasion of the plague, we must also be vigilant against special agents taking the opportunity to spread rumors, divert our attention, and carry out sabotage activities. Past experiences in the liberated areas have proven that Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents have always been very good at coordinating with diseases and disasters to cause harm. Now, based on the information obtained by the intelligence section every day, the Municipal Epidemic Prevention Committee sends people to the areas where situations occur to implement quarantine, disinfection, and other appropriate handling methods. As of now, there has been no plague epidemic or suspected occurrence in the city. As long as all citizens are not negligent or panicked, and under the leadership of the Municipal Epidemic Prevention Committee and various district sub-committees, carry out the struggle to prevent the plague in a step-by-step and effective manner, the plague will definitely not occur.
　　Hoping Citywide Medical Personnel Participate in Epidemic Prevention, Citizens Should Not Panic, Strictly Prevent Special Agents from Spreading Rumors
    [Beijing News] Medical personnel in the city are enthusiastically responding to the call of the Municipal Epidemic Prevention Committee and the Preparatory Committee of the Medical Workers Association, and are automatically signing up to work in the suburbs. Twenty doctors and seventy-five nurses from Peking University Medical College are participating, and a total of sixty-six military doctors and nurses from the Health Department of the North China Military Region are participating, including an entire company from the Second Rear Hospital who came from Tong County to participate in the city's suburban epidemic prevention work. Due to the righteous actions of these medical personnel, the difficulty of the city's lack of epidemic prevention personnel has been initially resolved. As of yesterday (the 4th), the Municipal Epidemic Prevention Committee has completed the initial quarantine network. In addition to the two railway stations at Qianmen and Xizhimen, and the seven city gates of Fucheng, Xizhi, Desheng, Anding, Chaoyang, Yongding, and Dongzhi, quarantine stations have been set up. Ten quarantine stations have also been established in the eastern suburbs, southern suburbs, Beiyuan, Haidian, Qinglongqiao, Fengtai, Changxindian, Beixin'an, Mentougou, and Tong County, conducting quarantine, preventive injections, disinfection, isolation, and other tasks day and night.

### 二百余医务人员参加京市组成防疫大队　全市即展开清洁捕鼠运动

　　二百余医务人员参加京市组成防疫大队
  　全市即展开清洁捕鼠运动
    【北京讯】本市预防鼠疫的工作已渐进入深入阶段。华北军区卫生部、京市卫生局和北大医院已经组织了包括六十个医生和一百七十个护士的防疫大队，在市防委会统一领导下，即日可以出发到东坝镇至琉璃渠的封锁线及城、郊各检疫站去工作。前方的封锁工作是十分巩固的，从察北张垣来京的旅客及牲畜，自上月二十七、八日以来，已经禁绝，偶有绕道而来的，也都按照中央防委会的规定，除实行严密的检疫消毒外，并予以十天到十四天的隔离。在市辖区以内，城、郊各区已经分别建立防疫分会，指挥全区有关预防鼠疫的清洁、防疫、宣传、封锁及情报工作。从下周起，全市将展开清洁捕鼠运动，北大医院及各文艺团体组织的各种宣传队亦将同时在各区进行宣传活动。给全市市民普遍注射疫苗的工作也正在逐步展开。
    但是察北的鼠疫还在继续蔓延，侵袭首都的可能仍然存在，而本市市民对防疫的认识也仍有种种偏向。为此，市防委会张文奇副主任特指出目前防疫工作中应该着重强调的两个问题：第一、他号召全市医务人员应该无条件的参加防疫工作，无论在疫情紧张的时候或者预防阶段全都应该如此。今天的预防鼠疫是华北人民当前的一项紧急战斗任务，每一个医务工作者都有参与并领导群众坚决完成这一任务的义务。每一个医务工作者也应该抓紧这个时机，考验自己是否已经建立了新的医务工作态度，以及是否愿意把自己的技术为人民服务。第二、他指出近日本市市民有事就向防委会报告，这是非常好的；但是惊慌失措的现象还很严重。譬如昨天某私立小学忽然传说新生中学有两个学生在上早操的时候因鼠疫死了，中午又传说新生中学已经停课封锁，于是大家立刻你也头痛、他也脑热起来。这是非常不好的。以惊慌来代替有效的预防工作，不但不能防止，反而会更加扩大鼠疫的蔓延。而且，尤其要注意的是：我们一方面要警惕鼠疫的侵袭，同时也要警惕特务分子的乘机造谣转移我们的注意力，进行破坏活动。过去解放区的经验证明：蒋匪特务向来是很会和病疫灾情配合为害的。现在每天根据情报股所获情报，市防会随时派人前往发生情况地区施行检疫消毒及其他适当的处理方法，截至现在为止，本市并无任何鼠疫疫情及疑似发生，只要全体市民不麻痹、不惊慌，在市防会及各区分会的领导下，有步骤有效力地进行防止鼠疫的斗争，鼠疫就一定不会发生。
　　希望全市医务人员参加防疫市民慎勿惊慌严防特务造谣
    【北京讯】本市医务人员正热烈响应市防疫委员会及医务工作者协会筹备会的号召，自动签名赴郊区工作。北大医学院有医师二十人及护士七十五人参加，华北军区卫生部军医和护士参加者共达六十六人，其中第二后方医院一个连部全部从通县赶来参加本市效区的防疫工作。由于这些医务人员的义举，本市防疫工作人员缺乏的困难已经初获解决。到昨（四）日止，市防委会已经完成了初期检疫网，除前门、西直门两个车站及阜城、西直、德胜、安定、朝阳、永定、东直等七个城门已设检疫站外，又在东郊、南郊、北苑、海甸、青龙桥、丰台、长辛店、北辛安、门头沟及通县设立了十个检疫站，日夜办理检疫及预防注射、消毒、隔离等各项工作。
