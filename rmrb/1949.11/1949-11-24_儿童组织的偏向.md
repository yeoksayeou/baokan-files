　　Deviations in Children's Organizations
　　　　　I. Do not treat the Young Pioneers as a narrow organization for a few children
　　Since the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League announced the draft constitution of the Young Pioneers, primary and secondary school students in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenyang, and other places have been eagerly requesting to join. This phenomenon indicates that children greatly need such an organization.

　　In the past, during the War of Resistance Against Japan and the Liberation War, the Young Pioneers and Children's Corps in the liberated areas produced many young anti-Japanese heroes. They played a significant role in popularizing education, comforting troops, standing guard, and uniting the vast number of children in learning and recreational activities. They demonstrated the good qualities of children who love their motherland and people, and the new attitude of loving learning and labor. Today, the People's Republic of China has been founded, and the entire country will soon be liberated. We believe that in the future, the Young Pioneers will achieve even more brilliant results in uniting and educating children.

　　Currently, Youth League committees in various regions are planning to establish Young Pioneer teams in a focused and phased manner. At this time, a particularly important issue to pay attention to is not to treat the Young Pioneers as a narrow organization for a minority of children.

　　In the past, when Beijing started establishing Young Pioneers and Children's Corps, some schools refused admission to children who were otherwise qualified, simply because they had glared at someone or been late to class once. The draft constitution of the Changchun Young Pioneers stipulated that the Young Pioneers were an organization of progressive children. Therefore, it required two members or one member of the Communist Youth League to introduce the applicant, fill out an application form, and be approved by the detachment after discussion in the team, followed by an admission ceremony. Such practices would shut out most children from the doors of children's organizations, alienating the Young Pioneers from the masses.

　　In Harbin and some other places, there was a practice of evaluating class backgrounds and dividing classes among children. This is also incorrect. Children from landlord families have not directly exploited others and originally did not know what class was. Their fathers' or grandfathers' class affiliations should not be pinned on them. After joining the team, if they are educated together with other children in the team and cultivated into good citizens who love the motherland, love the people, love labor, love science, and cherish public property, what's wrong with that?

　　The Young Pioneers is a mass organization, a children's own organization, and a school for uniting and educating the vast number of children. This is different from the Communist Youth League, which is an organization of advanced youth. The methods of the Communist Youth League should not be mechanically applied to the Young Pioneers.

　　We must extensively unite and organize children so that the vast number of children can be educated and engage in beneficial activities within their own organization. Of course, this does not mean that as soon as the Young Pioneers is established, we should demand the organization of the vast majority of children. If so, it would become a mere formality and render the Young Pioneers ineffective. When starting to build the team, we must gradually absorb children who actively study and participate in activities and develop forward in a phased manner.

　　The characteristics of children are: they are not fully developed physically, they are still growing, their thinking is simple, and they do not know much. The team's activities must be adapted to these characteristics.

　　There should not be too many team activities, and these activities should involve the majority or all children. Do not confine the activities within the Young Pioneers or draw a line between members and non-members, isolating the members from the masses. Only by uniting the vast number of children in learning, labor, recreation, sports, hygiene, and active work can the Young Pioneers truly play its role.

　　Among children, it is not appropriate to emphasize the role of pioneers or models, because children are not fully developed and do not understand much. If the role of models is emphasized, children will have to try their best to do it, resulting in damage to their health and the failure to accomplish the tasks.

　　Therefore, the activities of the Young Pioneers must be suitable for the needs of children. Otherwise, it will easily isolate the Young Pioneers from the masses and turn it into a narrow organization for a minority of children.

　　　　II. "Children should not be subjected to class background investigations"

　　In Northeast China, there is a children's theater troupe that is detached from production, where a group of eleven- or twelve-year-old children are "determining class composition." One by one, the children take turns reporting their history and tracing their roots. One child, the son of a female worker, was even traced back to before he was born, before the Japanese invasion of Northeast China. At that time, his family had more than ten mu of land, so people said he was of "middle peasant composition." After arguing for a long time, the conclusion was: "Even if you later became proletarian, now that your family has been allocated land again, you are no longer proletarian!"

　　This practice is very wrong and completely contrary to the spirit of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League's resolution on establishing the Young Pioneers. We should point out that even among educated youth, we should not overemphasize the issue of class origin. Youth and students from exploiting class backgrounds and petty-bourgeois backgrounds, due to their separation from family finances, the semi-colonial status of China, and the influence of progressive books, theoretical knowledge, especially the revolutionary movement, are often inclined to revolution. This is a historical fact that has been fully proven by successive revolutionary student movements since the May Fourth Movement. The Communist Youth League's constitution also specifically stipulates that "revolutionary educated youth" can join the League without a probationary period. How much more so for children! We ask, how can the dozen or so mu of land that a family once had before a child was born influence the child's learning and ideology, and influence the child's future? We ask, which child has ever participated in exploitation?

　　These comrades who are leading the children to determine their class background have forgotten what the ultimate goal of our revolution is? Isn't it to eliminate classes? Our class struggle today, such as land reform in rural areas and the division of classes, is aimed at eliminating the landlord class. When discussing the ideology of an adult, associating it with his class background is aimed at eliminating the bad influence of the reactionary class on him, and at raising his awareness of the struggle against the reactionary class, also for the sake of eliminating the reactionary class. In the future communist society, classes will be eliminated. We definitely do not want to make classes exist for as long as possible. Today's children under the new democratic education will surely enjoy the happiness of a proletarian society in the future. Now, they should be cultivated to love their motherland, love the people, love labor, love science, and cherish public property, so that they can break away from the ideological influence of the exploiting classes of the previous generation. All children can become builders of the new society. Even for the children of the landlord class, our attitude is to educate them well, so that when they grow up, they will become sons of the people and no longer be landlords, and there will be no landlords at that time. Why should we conduct class background investigations among children? To make them firmly remember: "I am the child of the petty bourgeoisie, I am definitely not the child of the working people, definitely not the child of the proletariat." What is the purpose of this? What is the effect of this? Have the comrades who lead the children to determine their class background thought about it?

　　This practice of investigating class background among children is completely wrong and should be resolutely opposed and overcome.

### 儿童组织的偏向

　　儿童组织的偏向
  　　　　　一、不要把少年儿童队当作一个少年儿童的狭隘组织
    青年团中央公布少年儿童队章程草案以后，北京、上海、天津、沈阳等地的中小学生都纷纷要求入队，这个现象说明了少年儿童们非常需要有这样的一个组织。
    过去，解放区的少年先锋队、儿童团，在抗日战争和解放战争期间，曾经出现过不少的抗敌小英雄，在普及教育、慰劳军队、站岗放哨、团结广大少年儿童进行学习和娱乐等活动上，都起了不少的作用，表现出少年儿童爱祖国、爱人民的好品质和爱学习、爱劳动的新态度。今天，中华人民共和国已经诞生了，全国就要完全解放，我们相信，今后少年儿童队在团结教育少年儿童方面，将会有更辉煌的成绩。
    现在各地团委都已经在计划有重点地有步骤地建立少年儿童队了，这个时候值得特别注意的一个问题，就是不要把少年儿童队当作一个少数少年儿童的狭隘组织。
    过去北京市开始建立少年先锋队、儿童团的时候，有些学校里，本来可以入团的小朋友，单是因为瞪了人家一眼、或者上课迟到过一次，就不能入团。长春市的少年先锋队章程草案上规定少先队是进步少年儿童的组织，因此需要队员二人或者青年团员一人介绍，填写志愿书，并且经过小队的讨论，分队部批准，举行入队仪式以后才能入队，这样的作法，都会把大多数的少年儿童关在少年儿童组织的大门以外，使少年儿童队脱离群众。
    在哈尔滨等一些地方，曾经在少年儿童里面评成份，划阶级，这也是不对的。地主阶级家庭的少年儿童，自己并没有直接剥削人，本来也不知道什么叫做阶级，不应该把他的父亲、祖父所属的阶级，扣在他的头上。他入队以后，和其他儿童在一起受到队里的教育，培养成一个爱祖国、爱人民、爱劳动、爱科学、爱护公共财物的好公民，那有什么不好呢？
    少年儿童队是一个群众团体，是少年儿童自己的一个组织，是团结和教育广大少年儿童的一个学校。这和青年团是先进青年的组织是有区别的，决不能把青年团的一套办法，生硬地搬到少年儿童队里去运用。
    我们必须广泛的团结和组织少年儿童，使广大的少年儿童在自己的组织里面受到教育，进行有益的活动。当然，并不是说一建立少年儿童队，就要求把极大多数少年儿童组织起来，如果那样，也会流于形式，使少年儿童队失去作用。在开始建队的时候，必须有步骤地先吸收积极学习，积极参加活动的少年儿童，有步骤地向前发展。
    少年儿童的特点是：生理上发育没有完全，还正在发育，思想单纯，各种知识知道的不多，队的活动必须要适应这些特点。
    队的活动不能太多，同时这些活动应该吸收大多数到全体少年儿童来参加，不要关在少年儿童队里面自己另搞一套，或在队员和非队员中间划一道界线，而把队员在群众中孤立起来。少年儿童只有团结了广大少年儿童进行学习、劳动、娱乐、体育卫生和积极工作，才能真正发挥它的作用。
    在少年儿童当中，是不能强调先锋作用或者模范作用的，因为少年儿童发育还没有完全，懂得的事情不多，如果强调模范作用，少年儿童只得拼命去作，结果，身体搞坏了，事情还没有做好。
    所以少年儿童队的活动要适合少年儿童的要求，不然就容易把少年儿童队从群众中孤立起来，变成少数少年儿童的狭隘组织了。
    　　　　二、“儿童不要进行查成份”
    东北有一个脱离生产的儿童剧团，一群十一二岁的小孩子在“定阶级成份”。一个个孩子轮流报告历史，轮流追查，有一个孩子是个女工的儿子，他们甚至追查他的历史到他还没有出世的日本进攻东北以前。那时候他家有十几亩地，于是人家就说他是“中农成份”。争论了半天，结论是：“即使你后来变成了无产阶级，但现在你家又分了地，你就又不是无产阶级了！”
    这种做法非常错误，和青年团中央关于建立少年儿童队决议的精神完全相反，我们应当指出，即使在知识青年中间，我们也不应当过分强调阶级出身问题，剥削阶级出身和小资产阶级出身的青年学生们，由于和家庭经济分离，由于中国半殖民地的地位，由于受到进步书籍、理论知识特别是革命运动的影响，很多倾向革命。这是五四运动以来的历次革命学生运动所已经完全证明了的历史事实。青年团团章中还特别规定了“革命知识青年”入团，可以没有候补期。何况是儿童！试问孩子出生以前，家里曾有过的十几亩地，从那里去影响这个孩子的学习和思想作风，从那里去影响这个孩子的将来？试问有那一个孩子曾经参加过剥削？
    这些领导孩子们定成份的同志，忘了我们革命的最后目标是什么？不是要消灭阶级吗？我们今天进行农村土地改革等阶级斗争，进行划分阶级，目的是为了消灭地主阶级。在谈到一个成人的思想的时候，联系他的阶级成份，目的是为了肃清反动阶级给他的坏影响，为了提高他向反动阶级斗争的觉悟，也是为了消灭反动阶级。在将来共产主义社会里，阶级是要消灭的。我们决不是要使阶级存在得愈久愈好。今天新民主主义教育下的孩子们，将来一定会享受到无产阶级社会的幸福，现在就应该培养他们爱祖国、爱人民、爱劳动、爱科学、爱护公共财物的思想作风，使他们脱离上一代的剥削阶级的思想影响，所有的孩子都能成为新社会的建设者。即使是地主阶级的孩子，我们的态度也是好好教育他，要他长大以后成为人民的儿子，不再做地主，那时候也没有地主了。为什么要在孩子中间进行查成份？要他牢牢记住：“我是小资产阶级的孩子，我绝不是劳动人民的孩子，绝不是无产阶级的孩子。”这目的是什么？作用是什么？领导孩子定成份的同志是不是想过？
    这种在少年儿童中查成份的做法，是完全错误的，应当坚决反对，予以克服。
