Mother's Letter
    Qiū Dīng
    A soldier's mother,
    —Little Qiūzi's mother,
    The letter goes like this:
　
    "Son! Put on your cotton clothes,
    Don't worry about home,
    And don't miss your mother.
　
    The flood has inundated our house and land,
    But we won't rely solely on the government for relief.
　
    Your father isn't too old yet,
    And I can still run around,
    Relying on our own two hands, we have nothing to
    worry about.
　
    He spins thread, I weave cloth,
    Picking up our old trade,
    Earning enough to eat and wear.
　
    Chairman Mao's soldiers,
    Mother's heart,
    Son! Always hold your gun!
　
    Son is busy, Mother is busy too,
    Remember Mother's words,
    May my son's name be on the list of meritorious heroes soon."
    　　　　　　　　November 3rd, at Military University

　　娘的来信
    丘丁
    一个战士的母亲，
    ——小丘子的娘，
    来信这样讲：
　
    “儿啊！你穿上棉衣裳，
    别惦记家，
    也别想娘。
　
    大水淹了咱的房和地，
    咱不单靠政府来救济。
　
    你爹还不算老，
    我还跑得动，
    靠着两只手，什么也不
    愁。
　
    他纺线，我织布，
    拾掇起老行，
    赚了吃，顾了穿。
　
    毛主席的战士，
    娘的心肠，
    儿啊！永远拿着枪！
　
    儿忙娘也忙，
    记住娘的话，
    愿儿早上功臣榜。”
    　　　　　　　　十一、三于军大
