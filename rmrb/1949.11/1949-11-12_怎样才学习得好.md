    How to Study Well
    He Ke Rang, Huang Yixian, Attached Middle School No. 2
    In our class, there is a student who spends almost all of his time, except for eating and going to the toilet, doing homework in the classroom or dormitory. He is never seen going out to play or rest. I remember during the second half of last year, when the workload was somewhat heavy, and the students were indeed quite busy, he would quietly get up at dawn, grab his textbook, and go to the classroom with a lamp to study alone. We advised him against it, but he didn't listen. As a result, his grades weren't very good, and his health deteriorated. This is one method of studying.
    Another way of studying is: paying attention in class and completing the assigned homework, but as soon as the homework is done, the books and notes are thrown aside to read extracurricular books. When doing homework, they are also very careless, so they often fail to get full marks on exams.
    I believe that both of the above learning methods are inappropriate. The former's learning method is "rote learning," simply memorizing texts and formulas, while the latter's learning method and attitude are careless and indifferent.
    The Dean's office has repeatedly emphasized the need to strictly prevent "rote learning" and "careless" learning methods, and has pointed out a new learning method, which is to not only concentrate in class, but also to review more after class. One cannot remember everything immediately after learning it, so "review" is very necessary.
    Secondly, when necessary, we can organize discussions and studies, and raise any unclear points for everyone to study together. This not only allows oneself to understand, but also allows one to remember what one has learned more deeply. However, for science subjects, one should study and research more on one's own.
    Doing exercises is also helping you review, making you remember more deeply. Therefore, you should be especially careful when doing exercises.
    Of course, extracurricular books are also very important, as they can increase your knowledge, but it is wrong to despise schoolwork because of this.
    Finally, there is another issue that deserves special attention, which is that learning should be coordinated with cultural entertainment. Don't just focus on learning and forget about entertainment, or you will become a "bookworm." During extracurricular activities, be sure to move around and relax your brain. This will not only help you learn well, but also benefit your physical and mental development.
    If you can do the above points, then you will definitely learn well.

    怎样才学习得好
    师大附中二部  何克让、黄义先
    我们班里有一位同学，他每天除了吃饭、大小便外，差不多的时间，都是在教室或寝室里搞功课。从不见他出门玩一玩或休息休息。我记得去年下半学期的时候，那时的功课是有些紧，同学们的确有些忙，他每天天刚麻亮时，就悄悄爬起来，拿上课本，端着灯到教室里去一个人学习。我们给他提了意见，他不听，结果，成绩并不怎么好，反倒把身体越搞越糟了。这是一种学习方法。
    再一种学习方法就是：课堂上注意听讲了，指定的作业也做完了，但是一做完了作业，把书本与笔记一丢，就看开课外书了。在做作业的时候，也是很马虎，所以，往往考试总是不能得满分。
    以上两种学习方式，我认为都是不恰当的；前者的学习方法是“死扣”，光是背课文公式，后者的学习方法与态度却是粗枝大叶，满不在乎。
    教导处曾一再提出过，要严格防止“死扣”与“粗枝大叶”的学习方法，并指出了新的学习方法，就是除在课堂上要专心听讲外，在课后还要多复习，一个人他学过了以后不能马上都记住，所以“复习”是很需要的。
    其次，就是在必要的时候，可以组织讨论研究，把不明白的地方提出来，大家共同研究。这样，不仅自己懂得了，面且对了解了的东西记得更深刻。但是，理科还是自己看，自己多研究。
    做练习同样也是帮助你复习，使你记得更深刻，因此，在做练习时要特别细心。
    当然，课外书也是很重要的，它可以增加更多的知识，但因此而轻视功课却是错误。
    最后，还有一个值得特别注意的问题，即是学习要与文化娱乐配合好，不要光注意学习，而忘掉娱乐，那就成了“书呆子”。在课外活动时一定要活动活动，轻松轻松脑子，这样不但学习得好，而且有益于身心的发展。
    如果能做到以上几点，那么学习一定会学得好。
