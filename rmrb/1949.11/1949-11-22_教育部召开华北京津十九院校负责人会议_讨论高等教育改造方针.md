Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 21st—The Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government convened a joint meeting of principal leaders of universities and colleges above the junior college level in the North China Region and the cities of Beijing and Tianjin. The meeting was held on the 17th in the conference room of the ministry, attended by more than 60 leaders from 19 institutions including Peking University, Tsinghua University, and Normal University. Minister Ma Xulun first delivered an opening speech, explaining that the ministry's educational policy is to implement education that serves the people, first and foremost the workers and peasants, to resolutely carry out the tasks stipulated in the Common Program, and to advance steadily in a planned and step-by-step manner. Zhang Zonglin then reported on the general situation of curriculum reform, personnel adjustments, fundraising, and leadership relations in North China's universities, as well as the deviations that occurred during implementation and the direction for improvement. Afterwards, the heads of each school reported on the work situation of their respective schools over the past three months and raised questions. Finally, Vice Minister Qian Junrui made a summary. He pointed out: 1. Higher education should be based on the existing foundation, implementing resolute and step-by-step reform, and cannot be greatly developed at present. The direction of reform is for everything to serve national construction, especially economic construction. 2. The central link of the current curriculum reform is to strengthen the study of political courses, so that students can establish a correct outlook on life and a concept of serving the people. Professional courses must meet the needs of construction, oppose being unrealistic and dogmatic, but at the same time pay attention to the systematic study of scientific theories, and must combine theory with practice. Professional courses should be streamlined as necessary. 3. The school's leadership organs must first correctly grasp the government's cultural and educational policies. Use various organizations to promote work, avoid bureaucratism; correctly implement democratic centralism, follow the mass line, and at the same time overcome the tendency of extreme democracy. 4. Today, the Liberation War is not yet over, and the country's main strength at present is to eliminate the remaining enemies and restore production. In order to take care of the country's financial situation, all schools must practice strict economy. The saving actions of Sino-French, Nankai, and Mongolian-Tibetan schools are worthy of everyone's learning.

　　教育部召开华北京津十九院校负责人会议
　　讨论高等教育改造方针
    【新华社北京二十一日电】中央人民政府教育部召开的华北区及京津两市专科以上院校主要负责人联席会议，于十七日在该部会议室举行，到会有北大、清华、师大等十九院校负责人六十余人。首由马叙伦部长致开会词，他说明该部教育方针是实行为人民服务，首先为工农服务的教育政策，坚决执行共同纲领中所规定的任务，有计划有步骤地稳步前进。次由张宗麟报告关于华北各大学课程改革、人事调整、经费筹措及领导关系诸问题的一般情况及执行中所发生的偏差与改进的方向。继由各校负责人报告各该校三个月来的工作情况，并提出问题。最后由钱俊瑞副部长作总结。他指出：一、高等教育应该是在现有基础上，实行坚决的和有步骤的改造，在目前还不能大大的发展。改造的方向是一切服务于国家的建设，特别是经济建设。二、当前课程改革的中心环节是加强政治课的学习，使学生建立正确的人生观，建立为人民服务的观点。业务课程必须切合建设的需要，反对好高鹜远、教条主义，但同时要注意科学理论的系统学习，必须作到理论与实际结合。业务课要实行必要的精简。三、学校领导机关首先要正确掌握政府的文教政策。运用各种组织推动工作，避免事务主义；正确实行民主集中制，走群众路线，同时克服极端民主的偏向。四、今天解放战争还未结束，国家目前的主要力量是消灭残敌和恢复生产，为了照顾国家财政状况，各校务必厉行节约。中法、南开和蒙藏学校的节约行动值得大家学习。
