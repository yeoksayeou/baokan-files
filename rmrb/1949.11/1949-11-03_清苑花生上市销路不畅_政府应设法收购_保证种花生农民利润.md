　　Qingyuan Peanut Sales are Sluggish
  　Government Should Find Ways to Purchase
  　Guarantee Profits for Peanut Farmers
    [Baoding News] Currently, peanuts have been harvested and threshed in various places, but in some areas, peanut sales are sluggish after they enter the market, and peanut prices have decreased. The government should quickly purchase through trade departments to protect the profits of peanut farmers, so that farmers will expand planting next year. This spring, farmers responded to the government's call to plant more peanuts and greatly increased peanut planting. According to incomplete statistics from Qingyuan, peanut fields have increased by about one-third compared to last year. The peanuts planted in Tianhao Village exceed 50% of the village's land. Beisong Village planted 360,000 mu of peanuts this year, accounting for 40% of the village's land, which is double the amount planted last year. However, due to the continuous rain this summer and autumn, peanut production has generally decreased by more than 50%. According to a survey of 25 households in Beisong Village, last year the average yield of peanuts per mu was 250 jin, but this year it is only about 100 jin, and there are many immature beans. Now farmers are in urgent need of exchanging peanuts for food, but the market is full of peanuts and there are few buyers, which has greatly reduced peanut prices. According to a survey of peanut prices in Dazhuangji, the county, 100 jin of peanuts could be exchanged for one shi of black beans in the past, but this year 100 jin of peanuts can only be exchanged for five dou of beans. Farmers are beginning to resent that the government called for more planting but did not find ways to purchase, which will affect farmers' peanut planting next year. In order to encourage farmers to plant more peanuts next year, so as to extract oil for export and exchange for the country's necessities, it is necessary to maintain a certain profit for peanut farmers; the government should quickly purchase peanuts through trade departments or oil companies, and gradually increase peanut prices.

　　清苑花生上市销路不畅
  　政府应设法收购
  　保证种花生农民利润
    【保定讯】目前各地花生已刨打完，但有些地方花生上市后销路不畅，花生价格降低，政府应迅速通过贸易部门收购，保障种花生农民的利润，以使农民明年扩大增种。今春农民响应政府多植花生的号召，大量增种花生。据清苑不完整统计，花生地比去年增种三分之一左右。田蒿村种的花生，超过全村土地百分之五十。北宋村今年植花生三十六万亩，占全村土地百分之四十，比去年增种一倍。但是由于今年夏秋霪雨连绵，花生普遍减产百分之五十以上。据北宋村二十五户的调查，去年每亩平均产花生二百五十斤，今年却产百斤左右，并且嫩豆多。现农民收下花生急需换食粮，但市场花生挤满，买主稀少；致使花生价格大为降低。据该县大庄集花生价格调查，当年每百斤花生换一石黑豆，今年每百斤花生只能换五斗豆。农民开始懑怨政府号召多种而不设法购买，这样会影响农民明年增种花生。为使农民明年多种花生，以便榨油出口换回国家的必需品，必须保住种花生农民的一定利润；政府应速通过贸易部门或油脂公司收购花生，逐步提高花生价格。
