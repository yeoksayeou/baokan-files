Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 9th: TASS London Dispatch: London held a grand celebration on the 6th to commemorate the 32nd anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution. This was the largest celebration of the Soviet October Revolution Day held in Britain in ten years. The commemoration was presided over by Iddens, Chairman of the British-Soviet Friendship Association, and the famous Soviet poet Surkov participated. Pritt, Chairman of the Society for Cultural Relations with the USSR, pointed out at the meeting: The Soviet Union is a great warrior in defending peace; it struck the first blow for peace twenty-four hours after its birth, and has been working for peace with increasing success ever since. Isobel Brown, a famous peace and democracy fighter, listed the achievements of the Soviet Union. Recalling the era when everyone was asking, "Can the Bolsheviks seize power?" she said that the Bolsheviks not only seized power, but their country is growing stronger. The establishment of the people's democratic countries in Eastern Europe has opened a new chapter; a great new chapter is now being written in China. Finally, the Soviet Union has controlled atomic energy. This is a great victory for peace. Pearson, Chairman of the Scottish Trades Union Congress and a miner who recently returned from a visit to the Soviet Union, praised the high level of mechanization in Soviet mining and the great concern for workers' welfare. Campbell, editor of the Daily Worker, said that the Soviet Union showed the way forward for workers everywhere. Because capitalist forces know they cannot show their superiority in peaceful competition, they use people like the "madman of Belgrade" and make Goebbels-like lies and distortions.

　　At the end of the meeting, the entire audience stood up and passed a telegram of greetings to the Soviet people, stating: "Your progress has brought hope to mankind in a world dominated by crisis. You have proven that man can conquer his age-old enemies—poverty, ignorance, and insecurity. Your firm stand in support of peace and the prohibition of atomic weapons has earned you the respect of all progressive and peace-loving people. As we congratulate you, we also pay tribute to your great leader, Stalin. We assure you that we will never forget his great contribution to our common struggle against the Nazi enemy. Strengthening the friendship between our two peoples is our primary patriotic duty. Hostility can cost our country everything, but friendship can gain everything: better trade, a better life, greater security, and lasting peace."

　　Manchester, the center of the British textile industry, also held a celebration on the 6th to commemorate the 32nd anniversary of the October Revolution, hosted by the Manchester branch of the British-Soviet Friendship Association. The venue was extremely crowded. Professor Grushchenko, a member of the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries delegation, and Koloven, a counselor at the Soviet Embassy, were also invited to participate and were warmly welcomed by the audience. Harris, a member of the British-Soviet Friendship Association and a scientist, emphasized in his opening remarks the decisive role played by the Soviet Union in defeating the fascist army and the great achievements of the Soviet Union in solving domestic problems. He also pointed out that friendship with the Soviet Union is the key to peace. He said that the British working class is a solid detachment in the common front of peace. United with the Soviet working class, it becomes an invincible force. Hodgkinson, an independent Labor MP, said that on the eve of the 32nd anniversary of the October Revolution, he loudly declared his trust in the Soviet Union and its peaceful foreign policy. Hodgkinson condemned the new war preparations and despicable anti-Soviet slander led by American imperialists and their British servants, and he fiercely attacked the Labor government's slavish obedience in following American aggressive policies. He declared to the enthusiastically applauding audience that the British people would never participate in a war of aggression against any country.

　　对苏友好是和平的钥匙
    伦敦等地集会庆祝
  　一致决议电苏联人民致敬
    【新华社北京九日电】塔斯社伦敦讯：伦敦在六日举行了盛大的伟大十月社会主义革命三十二周年的纪念会。这是十年以来在英国所举行的最盛大的苏联十月革命节庆祝纪念。纪念会由英苏友好协会主席伊丹斯主持，有著名苏联诗人苏尔科夫参加。对苏文化协会主席普里特在纪念会上指出：苏联是保卫和平的伟大战士；它在诞生二十四小时之后，就为和平作了第一击，而且一直日益成功地为和平而努力。著名的和平民主战士爱索柏尔·布朗，历举了苏联的成就。她回溯那个到处都述说着“布尔什维克能够掌握政权吗？”这个问题的时代之后说，布尔什维克不仅掌握了政权，而且他们的国家日益壮大了。东欧人民民主国家的建立，开始了新的一章；伟大的新的一章现在正在中国写成。最后，苏联已控制了原子能。这是和平的伟大胜利。最近访苏归来的苏格兰职工大会主席矿工皮尔森在发言中盛赞苏联矿业中的高度机械化水平，和对工人福利的巨大关心。工人日报编辑甘培尔说，苏联向一切地方的工人指明了前进的道路。由于资本主义势力知道他们不能以和平的竞争显示他们的优越，所以，他们就利用诸如“贝尔格莱德的狂徒”那种人，并作出戈培尔式的谎言和歪曲。
    集会最后全场起立通过向苏联人民致敬电称：“你们的进展给被危机所支配的世界中的人类带来了希望。你们已证明了人能够征服他的终古以来的敌人——贫穷、愚昧和不安全。你们拥护和平及禁止原子武器的坚定立场，使你们得到一切进步的、爱好和平的人民的尊敬。我们向你们致贺时，同时也向你们的伟大领袖斯大林致敬。我们向你们保证，我们将决不忘记他对我们反对纳粹仇敌的共同斗争的伟大贡献。加强我们两国人民间的友谊，是我们首要的爱国天职。敌对可以使我国失去一切，但友好则可以得到一切：更好的贸易，更好的生活，更大的安全和持久和平”。
    英国纺织业中心曼彻斯特亦于六日在英苏友好协会曼彻斯特分会主持下举行了十月革命三十二周年的纪念会。会场异常拥挤。苏联对外文化关系协会代表团团员格鲁什琴科教授和苏联大使馆参赞科洛文亦应邀参加，他们受到听众热烈的欢迎。英苏友好协会会员、科学家哈力斯在开幕词中强调苏联在击败法西斯军队中所起的决定性作用，苏联在解决国内问题方面的巨大成就。他又指出：对苏友好是和平的钥匙。他说：英国工人阶级是和平的共同阵线中一个坚实的支队。它与苏联工人阶级联合起来，就成为无敌的力量。独立的工党议员霍金逊称，在十月革命三十二周年的前夕，他大声宣布他信任苏联和苏联的和平外交政策。霍金逊斥责以美国帝国主义者及其英国奴仆为首的新战争准备和卑劣的反苏诬蔑宣传，他猛烈抨击工党政府在追随美国侵略政策中奴性的驯服。他向热烈鼓掌的听众宣称，英国人民决不参加对任何国家的侵略战争。
