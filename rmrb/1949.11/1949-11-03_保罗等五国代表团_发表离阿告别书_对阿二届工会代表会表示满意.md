Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, October 28th: According to the Albanian Telegraph Agency, the trade union delegations from Bulgaria, Romania, Poland, Hungary, and Greece, who attended the Second Albanian Trade Union Congress, issued a farewell letter before leaving Albania stating: We are very satisfied with the work of the Congress. We are convinced that under the leadership of the Workers' Party and the Democratic Government headed by Comrade Hoxha, the Albanian people are building the foundations of socialism in their country, implementing a policy of peace, progress, and democracy, defending their independence, and opposing all provocations. The reports, discussions, and resolutions and statutes passed by the Congress point out that the national construction and industrial construction of Albania are the foundation for the development of people's democratic countries. The Congress has become a demonstration of the international proletariat's shared destiny in the struggle for democracy, progress, and peace. The Congress has helped to strengthen the friendly and fraternal unity with the victorious socialist country—the Soviet Union—and with the people's democratic countries, and expressed the Albanian people's gratitude to the outstanding leader of progressive humanity—Comrade Stalin. We hope that you will complete and exceed your national plan and will tell our trade unions everything about our experiences here.
