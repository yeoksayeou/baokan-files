	First Batch of Domestically Produced Live Plague Vaccine
	Trial Injections Show Normal Reactions
	Tiantan Epidemic Prevention Center Can Provide Large Quantities in the Future

[Reported by this newspaper] The first batch of live plague vaccine produced on a trial basis by the Tiantan Epidemic Prevention Center was completed on the 12th. To be cautious, colleagues at the center were injected on the same day. There were no side effects after the injection, the reaction was normal, with only localized redness and swelling, and no other dangers. The center has submitted a formal document to the Central Epidemic Prevention Committee for record. The first batch of more than 500,000 cc (enough for more than 500,000 people) will be handed over to the Central Epidemic Prevention Committee for distribution to various regions. In the future, a daily output of 400,000 to 500,000 cc can be guaranteed. However, this vaccine is a non-toxic live bacteria, diluted in physiological saline, and has a very short lifespan of only two weeks, so future production will be increased or decreased as needed. The manufacturing process of this bacterial vaccine only takes one week (initial preparation takes ten days), which is two-thirds less time compared to the three weeks required for dead bacterial vaccines. This is the first domestically produced live plague vaccine.

    国产首批鼠疫生菌苗
    试验注射反应正常
    天坛防疫处今后可大量供应
    【本报讯】天坛防疫处试制的鼠疫生菌疫苗，第一批出品已于十二日制造完成。为慎重起见，当日注射了本处的同仁，注射以后没有副作用，反应正常，局部有红肿，没有其他的危险。该处已备文呈中央防疫委员会存案。第一批五十多万公撮（可注射五十多万人），即可交中央防疫委员会分配各地使用。今后每日可保证四五十万公撮的产量。惟此种疫苗为无毒之活菌，稀释于生理盐水中，寿命很短，仅能保存二星期，故以后产量可视需要而增减。此菌苗制造过程只需一星期（初次准备需十日），与死菌疫苗需时三星期相较省时三分之二。这是中国鼠疫生菌疫苗初次产品。
