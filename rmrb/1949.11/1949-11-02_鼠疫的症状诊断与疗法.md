Due to the different areas of the body invaded by plague bacteria, the strength of the bacterial virulence, and the size of the body's resistance, the symptoms that occur in the body also vary. The most common are bubonic plague and pneumonic plague, while septicemic plague and cutaneous plague are less common.

The incubation period of plague: usually three to five days, sometimes one day for pneumonic plague and septicemic plague.

(1) General symptoms of plague:

Plague develops rapidly, with no significant prodromal symptoms. It suddenly begins with chills and shivering, body temperature rises to 39-40 degrees Celsius, dizziness, headache, sometimes vomiting, facial flushing, conjunctival congestion, the patient's speech is slurred, and they quickly fall into toxic symptoms and physical weakness. Several hours before death, breathing is shallow and rapid, about 60 times per minute, cold sweat appears on the forehead, body temperature drops at the same time, pulse is rapid, heart sounds are weak, tongue is dry with a thick white coating, liver and spleen are enlarged, and various rashes appear on the skin, including roseola, pityriasis, or pustular rash. Plague rash is not a primary symptom.

A. Symptoms of bubonic plague:

Primary bubonic plague occurs when bacteria directly invade the lymph nodes through the skin. In addition to the common symptoms mentioned above, the local lymph nodes swell, and the surface skin turns purplish-red. Because the swollen glands are very painful, patients often adopt forced postures. For example, with axillary gland swelling, the upper limb is raised; with inguinal gland swelling, the lower limb is extended outward; with cervical gland swelling, a wry neck posture is adopted.

When the patient recovers, the swollen glands suppurate and rupture spontaneously. When the lymph node swelling forms an ulcer, spontaneous elimination and granulation are very slow, and it takes a long time to heal, eventually forming scar tissue. During the healing process, it may become the source of secondary plague. The secretions in the lymph nodes contain many plague bacteria. It takes more than two weeks for a plague patient to fully recover their health. The mortality rate of bubonic plague is usually 50% to 90%.

B. Symptoms of pneumonic plague:

Pneumonic plague develops suddenly, with increased body temperature, and the symptoms described above quickly occur. Systemic toxic symptoms are evident, followed by chest pain, difficulty breathing, coughing, and a large amount of sputum. In the beginning, the sputum contains foam, but blood is quickly found in the sputum; initially the sputum is pink, and then the color gradually deepens, breathing becomes frequent, then difficult, and most notably, staggering while walking. The disease progresses very rapidly, sometimes in one day or even several hours, the patient's condition develops to the most serious stage. The cause of death is due to sudden death caused by heart failure.

C. Septicemic plague:

It often occurs because the bacteria's toxins are too strong and the body's resistance is too weak. The most significant feature is only plague-related systemic poisoning. Patients with septicemic plague sometimes have skin rashes, vomiting blood, excreting bloody urine or bloody stools before death, and die very quickly. The mortality rate is 100%.

D. Cutaneous plague:

The cause is flea bites. Small blisters develop at the bite site, then turn into boils or scabs, with a black center, raised edges, and surrounded by a red halo. The ulcerated sore varies in diameter. When cutaneous plague is complicated by bubonic plague, lymphangitis often appears in between.

(2) Diagnosis of plague

A. Diagnosis of bubonic plague: Severe systemic symptoms, severe inflammation around the lymph nodes, unclear boundaries of the gland swelling, red skin, and severe pain. Bacterial laboratory diagnosis is the final decisive diagnosis. Use a sterilized syringe to draw lymph node exudate, first perform a direct smear examination, and culture plague bacteria and perform animal experiments. If plague bacteria are found on the smear specimen, prevention work should begin immediately. As for the final decision of the diagnosis, it is still necessary to wait for the results of the culture and animal experiments. If plague bacteria are detected in the culture medium and animal body, it can be confirmed as bubonic plague.

B. Diagnosis of pneumonic plague: Chest pain, coughing up sputum, initially clear and foamy, then turns bloody. Laboratory diagnosis: use a platinum loop to inoculate the patient's sputum into a culture medium, then mix the sputum in saline, use a syringe to draw out a portion and inject it into animals for animal experiments, and finally take a portion of the sputum for smear examination. Bacteria are easily detected in the sputum of pneumonic plague patients. If plague bacteria are proven from the smear specimen, prevention work must be started immediately.

(3) Treatment of plague

A. Sulfonamide mixed serum therapy: For the treatment of bubonic plague patients. On the first day, immediately take two watts of sulfonamide and inject 60 to 100 cc of serum, then inject 1 cc of 1% methylene blue solution 5 to 6 times a day. Each patient should continue to take sulfonamide and inject serum for 15 days. During this 15-day treatment period, bubonic plague patients should receive 40 watts of sulfonamide powder, 200 to 300 cc of anti-plague serum, and 35 cc of 1% methylene blue solution.

For the treatment of primary pneumonic plague: The earlier the treatment of pneumonic plague patients is carried out, the greater the effect. When the disease occurs, take the medicine immediately, and the procedure and method of administration are the same as for bubonic plague. The amount of medicine received in 15 days is 50 watts of sulfonamide, 40 cc of 1% methylene blue solution, and 400 to 600 cc of serum.

When using various medicines, it is necessary to consider the patient's physique and condition, and it is necessary to pay attention to whether the patient has allergies when taking sulfonamides, or whether poisoning may occur when using too much. Sulfonamide has a very good effect on bubonic plague. According to statistics from the Northeast Plague Prevention and Control Work, 214 out of 333 patients were cured, with a cure rate of 64.3%.

B. Streptomycin therapy: 1. For bubonic plague, when injecting 1 million to 1.5 million units of streptomycin on the first day (1.0 gm - 1.5 gm), the body temperature drops from 40 degrees Celsius to normal, and systemic symptoms disappear at the same time. Local application of streptomycin to the swollen glands can reduce the bacteria in the lymph nodes, and the swelling of the glands will stop.

2. For pneumonic plague: The body temperature does not drop at the time of injection. After 10 to 15 days, the body temperature drops, and the bacteria in the patient's sputum decreases.

Therapeutic effect of streptomycin:

In 1947, during the plague epidemic in Northeast China, the results of using streptomycin for treatment showed that all five bubonic plague patients were cured. One patient with true pneumonic plague was also cured. Although the statistics are small, it can be seen that streptomycin has a great effect on the treatment of plague.

　　鼠疫的症状诊断与疗法
    由于鼠疫细菌侵入的部位不同，细菌毒力的强弱，人体抵抗力的大小，而身体所发生的病症亦不同，最常见的是腺鼠疫和肺鼠疫，而鼠疫败血症和皮肤鼠疫比较少见。
    鼠疫的潜伏期：普通为三天到五天，肺鼠疫和鼠疫败血症有时一天。
　　（一）鼠疫的一般症状：
    鼠疫发病很快，并没有显著的先驱症状。突然开始恶寒战栗，体温上升至三十九度——四十度，头昏、头痛、有时呕吐、颜面潮红、球结膜充血、患者言语含糊、很快陷于中毒症状、身体衰弱。临死前数小时，呼吸浅而快，每分钟约六十次，额上出冷汗，体温同时下降，脉搏频速，心音低弱，舌干，有白苔甚厚，肝脾肿大，皮肤上出现各种不同的发疹，蔷薇疹、秕糠疹、或脓疱疹，鼠疫发疹并非主要症状。
    甲、腺鼠疫症状：
    原发性腺鼠疫，是细菌经皮肤直接侵入淋巴腺而发生的，除有上述之共同症状外，局部淋巴腺肿大，表面皮肤变成紫红色。腺肿因有剧痛，患者多取被迫姿势，如腋窝腺肿时，将上肢抬起，鼠蹊腺肿时，将下肢向外侧展开，颈腺肿时则取斜颈姿势。
    患者恢复时，腺肿化脓后自溃，淋巴腺肿形成溃疡时，自家消除及肉芽之发生均甚迟缓，经长时间方能愈合，结果形成瘢痕组织。在愈合过程中，可能由它成为合并续发性鼠疫之根源。淋巴腺内之分泌物含有许多鼠疫菌。鼠疫患者完全恢复健康，须经过两星期以上。腺鼠疫的死亡率普通为百分之五十至九十。
    乙、肺鼠疫症状：
    肺鼠疫是突然发病，体温增高，很快发生以上所述的症状，全身显中毒症状，继感胸部疼痛，呼吸困难，咳嗽，大量吐痰。于开始时痰中代有泡沫，但很快的于痰中即发现血液；初时痰呈桃红色，其后颜色渐浓，呼吸频数，继而困难，最显著是走路打晃。病势之发展甚速，有时经一昼夜，甚至数小时，患者之病势即发展到最严重时期。其致死亡之原因，由于惹起心脏衰弱骤然而死。
    丙、鼠疫败血症：
    多因细菌之毒素过强，身体之抵抗力过弱而发生，最显著的特点是只有鼠疫性全身中毒。鼠疫败血症患者临死时，有时皮肤出现发疹、吐血、排泄血尿或便血，经过很快即死。死亡率为百分之百。
    丁、皮肤鼠疫：
    原因为蚤的刺伤，在被咬处发生小水泡，然后变为疖或疤，中央呈黑色，周围隆起，围以红晕，溃烂成疡直径大小不等。皮肤鼠疫合并腺鼠疫时，其间常出现淋巴管炎。
  　（二）鼠疫的诊断
    甲、腺鼠疫的诊断：全身症状重，淋巴腺周围炎重，腺肿境界不明，皮肤呈红色，有剧痛。细菌检验诊断，是做最后决定性诊断。用消毒的注射器抽取淋巴腺渗出液，先作涂片直接检查，并培养鼠疫菌及做动物实验，在涂抹标本上如果发现鼠疫菌，应即开始防疫工作。至于诊断的最终决定，还须等待培养的结果和动物实验的成绩，如果在培养基里和动物体内检出鼠疫菌时，才能确诊为腺鼠疫。
    乙、肺鼠疫的诊断：胸痛，喀痰，最初澄清，泡沫状，后变血痰。化验诊断：用白金耳将患者的痰接种培养基内，然后将痰混于食盐水内，用注射器抽出一部分注射于动物身上作动物实验，最后取出痰的一部分作涂片检查。肺鼠疫痰内细菌容易查出，如果从涂片标本里证明出鼠疫菌时，立刻必得开始防疫工作。
  　（三）鼠疫的治疗
    甲、磺胺混合血清疗法：对于腺鼠疫患者的治疗。第一天立刻服磺胺两瓦注射血清六十到一百西西，再注射百分之一美蓝液每天五到六次，每次一西西。每一个患者要继续服磺胺，注射血清，十五天。于此十五天治疗期间，腺鼠疫患者应受到磺胺粉四十瓦，抗鼠疫血清二百到三百西西，百分之一美蓝液三十五西西。
    对于原发性肺鼠疫的治疗：肺鼠疫患者的治疗进行愈早，所获效果愈大。当发病时立即服药其程序服法同腺鼠疫，在十五天所受到的药量为磺胺五十瓦，百分之一美蓝液四十西西，血清四百到六百西西。
    使用各种药品时，必须按着病人的体格及病势，斟酌使用，必须注意到患者对于服用磺胺时，有无过敏症，或使用过多时，可能发生中毒现象。磺胺对于腺鼠疫的效果甚佳，据东北防治鼠疫工作统计在三百三十三名患者中二百一十四名治愈，治疗率为百分之六四·三。
    乙、链霉菌素疗法：１、对于腺鼠疫于第一日注射链霉菌素一百万至一百五十万单位时。（１０ｇｍ——１５ｇｍ），体温从四十度降到正常，同时全身症状消失。腺肿局部应用链霉菌素，可使淋巴腺内细菌减少，腺肿因之停止肿大。
    ２、对于肺鼠疫：注射当时体温并不下降。经过十天到十五天后，体温下降，患者痰内细菌减少。
    链霉菌素的治疗效果：
    一九四七年东北鼠疫流行时，应用链霉菌素治疗的结果，五名腺鼠疫患者全部治愈。应用于真性肺鼠疫患者一名亦治好，统计数目虽小，但可以看到链霉菌素对于鼠疫治疗的效果，是很大的。
