    Overview of Worker Education in Beijing
    Chen Hong
    In Beijing, over 44,000 workers from various state-owned factories, districts, industries, and some private factories have participated in learning organizations such as "Staff and Worker Training Classes," "Worker Night Schools," "Study Groups," "Worker Literacy Classes," and "Vocational Schools," engaging in relatively systematic political and cultural learning. Including those organized by the trade union in the form of large lectures, a total of 156,000 trade union members (accounting for 40% of all employees) have received preliminary political, policy, and current affairs education. After the liberation of Beijing, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party first established "Cadre Training Classes," drawing underground Party members and activists from various state-owned factories to educate them on basic Party knowledge and the establishment of a communist worldview, studying historical materialism, Party building, and some current Party policies. In April, the Preparatory Committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions also held "Staff and Worker Training Classes" to cultivate activists among the factory workers, making them the backbone of production and trade union work. The main content of the three phases of the Staff and Worker Training Classes (now called Staff and Worker Schools) included "Historical Materialism," "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party," "Class Struggle and the Theory of the State," and "Labor Policy and Trade Union Work." More than 2,000 employees who had studied in the training classes of both the Municipal Party Committee and the Preparatory Committee of the Federation of Trade Unions made rapid progress in their political thinking. Taking the third phase of the Municipal Party Committee's Cadre Training Class as an example, during the learning process, the masses generally requested to join the Party, and the number of Party members increased from 25% at the beginning of the term to 62% at the end. After graduation, the workers returned to their factories and played an active role in motivating the masses to improve production and organize workers' learning.
    Beijing's formal and large-scale worker education work began in the summer. The Preparatory Committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Municipal Education Bureau, the Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, and the Municipal Women's Federation mobilized 247 League members and progressive students from major universities and middle schools during the summer vacation, sending them to 22 state-owned factories and 11 districts to carry out summer worker education work. More than 12,000 workers participated in the summer study, divided into 330 classes of high, middle, and elementary levels according to their educational level. The content of the study focused on "Labor Creates the World" and "Basic Problems of the Chinese Revolution," combined with cultural learning. The workers who participated in the summer study generally improved their class consciousness, and most of them had a preliminary understanding of the "People's Democratic Dictatorship." They realized that the working class is the leading class of the new China, and that learning is for being the masters of the house. The important result of summarizing the summer worker education was to improve the workers' class consciousness, production enthusiasm, and increase the consciousness of learning, laying a good foundation for carrying out formal worker education in the future.
    On the basis of summer learning, factories and districts are carrying out regular revolutionary theory, policy and current affairs education through forms such as "Study Groups," "Short-term Training Classes," and "Worker Night Schools," such as "History of Social Development," "People's Democratic Dictatorship," "Factory Security Work," "Everyone Runs the Trade Union," and the three documents of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. All employees of the Telecommunications Bureau and the Postal Bureau participated in "Study Groups," while the Garment Factory and other factories sometimes used the "downtime" after the completion of "shock production" tasks to concentrate on learning. At the same time, "Worker Night Schools" (or Vocational Schools, After-work Middle Schools, Adult Night Schools, etc.) organized by the Preparatory Committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Municipal Education Bureau, and major universities and middle schools, separately recruited workers from various private factories, independent laborers scattered in various industries, military families, out-of-school and unemployed intellectuals, and housewives to participate in learning.
    In addition, in order to eliminate narrow nationalist ideas among workers and to welcome the Asian-Australian Trade Union Representatives Conference, internationalism education is currently being carried out among workers throughout the city, with content such as "Introduction to the Soviet Union," "Introduction to Asian and Australian Countries," "Introduction to the World Federation of Trade Unions," "The Two Major Camps in the World," and "Overview of Communist Parties in Various Countries."
    At present, in addition to political learning and short-term learning, workers also require regular "cultural" and "technical" learning. Cultural classes have been established in the Water Company, Shijingshan Power Plant, and various districts, and "Technical Learning Classes" and "Apprentice Learning Classes" have also been established in the 70th Ordnance Factory, Tram Company, Power Plant, and other organizations.
    Improving the political consciousness and cultural level of the working people will become one of the important conditions for developing production, and improving culture is the basis for learning politics and technology. Therefore, on the existing basis, implementing formal cultural and technical and other vocational education in a planned and step-by-step manner will become one of the urgent tasks of the People's Government in the future.

    京市工人教育概况
    陈泓
    北京市各公营工厂、各区、各行业和部分私营工厂，已有四万四千余工人参加了“职工训练班”、“工人夜校”、“学习小组”、“工人识字班”和“业余学校”等学习组织，进行着较有系统的政治文化学习；连依靠工会所组织的上大课等方式，受着初步政治、政策和时事教育的工会会员共有十五万六千人（占全体职工的百分之四十）。北京解放后，中共北京市委会首先成立了“干部训练班”，抽调各公营工厂的地下党员和积极分子，进行党的基本知识和建立共产主义人生观的教育，学习唯物史观、党的建设和党在目前的某些政策。四月间，市总工会筹委会又举办了“职工训练班”，培养各厂职工中的积极分子，使之成为生产与工会工作中的骨干。三期的职工训练班（现名职工学校）学习内容主要的有“唯物史观”、“中国革命与中国共产党”、“阶级斗争与国家学说”以及“劳动政策和工会工作”等，曾在中共市委会和总工会筹委会两训练班学习过的二千余职工，政治思想进步很快，以市委干训班第三期为例，在学习过程中群众普遍的要求入党，党员数目由开学时的百分之二十五，增至结束时的百分之六十二。毕业的工人回厂后，在带动群众提高生产和组织工人学习上都起了积极的作用。
    北京市正规的、大规模的工人教育工作，是从暑期开始的，市总工会筹委会、市教育局、中共市青委、市妇委等，曾利用暑假动员各大、中学的团员和进步同学二百四十七人分发到二十二个公营工厂和十一个区里去开展暑期工人教育工作。参加暑期学习的工人共一万二千余人，按文化程度高低编成高、中、初三级共三百三十个班。学习内容以“劳动创造世界”、“中国革命基本问题”为主，配合着文化学习。参加暑期学习的工人，阶级觉悟普遍提高了，对于“人民民主专政”一般的也都有了初步的认识，他们已认识了工人阶级是新中国的领导阶级，学习是为了当家作主人。总结暑期工人教育的重要成果是提高了工人们的阶级觉悟、生产情绪，并增加了学习的自觉性，给今后开展正规的工人教育打下了良好的基础。
    在暑期学习的基础上，各厂、区，通过“学习小组”、“短期训练班”、“工人夜校”等形式，进行着经常的革命理论、政策与时事教育，如“社会发展史”、“人民民主专政”、“工厂保卫工作”、“大家办工会”以及人民政协三大文件等，电信局和邮政局的职工全体参加“学习小组”，被服厂等有时则利用“突击生产”任务完成后的“停工待料”期间，集中学习。同时市总工会筹委会、市教育局和各大、中学举办的“工人夜校”（或称业余学校、工余中学、成人夜校等），分别吸收各私营工厂工人、各行业分散的独立劳动者、军属、失学失业的知识分子以及家庭妇女参加学习。
    此外，为消除工人中狭隘的民族主义思想，迎接亚澳职工代表会议，目前全市工人正普遍的进行着国际主义教育，内容为“苏联介绍”、“亚澳各国介绍”、“世界工联介绍”、“世界两大阵营”以及“世界各国共产党概况”等。
    目前，除了政治学习和短期性质的学习外，工人们还要求获得经常的“文化”与“技术”学习。现在在自来水公司、石景山发电所及各区里已先后成立文化班，在七十兵工厂、电车公司、发电所等也有了“技术学习班”和“艺徒学习班”等组织。
    提高劳动人民的政治觉悟与文化水平将成为发展生产的重要条件之一，而提高文化又是学习政治与技术的基础。因此，在现有的基础上有计划、有步骤的实施正规的文化和技术等各项业余教育，将成为今后人民政府的迫切任务之一。
