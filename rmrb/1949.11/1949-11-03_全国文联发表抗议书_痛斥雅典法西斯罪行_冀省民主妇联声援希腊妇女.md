The National Federation of Literary and Art Circles Issues Protest
Denouncing Fascist Crimes in Athens
Hebei Provincial Democratic Women's Federation Voices Support for Greek Women

[This newspaper report] The All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles has issued a protest, strongly protesting the brutal death sentence imposed by the royalist fascists in Athens on the leaders of the Greek people's revolution. The protest states that we, representing the national literary and art organizations and literary and art workers, protest this lawless fascist bloodbath and demand the immediate cancellation of this unreasonable verdict. The people of the People's Republic of China are thinking day and night of the brave warriors of the Greek people imprisoned in Athens. We know that, like US Communist leader Dennis and Australian Communist leader Sharkey, they are the true representatives of Greek civilization and the warriors of peace for all the people of the world. The people of the world know that saving them is saving themselves. Let the marching footsteps toward fascism shake the roofs of the Athens prisons. Let the fascist reactionaries know that they not only "feel fear for their impending death," but the people will soon use their solemn power to judge these fascist criminals. Please, brave Greek people and your own armed forces—the Greek Democratic Army warriors—remember that the peace-loving people of the world are your brothers and sisters, and stand on your side. Freedom and justice will ultimately triumph, and the people's power will ultimately triumph. The protest concludes by quoting Pushkin's poem to send condolences and respect to the warriors of the Greek people:
    "Heavy chains will fall,
    Dark prisons will collapse,
    Freedom will joyfully greet
    you at the door,
    Brothers will hand you
    swords."
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 2nd - The preparatory committee of the Hebei Provincial Democratic Women's Federation sent a telegram to the Greek Democratic Women's League regarding the death sentence imposed on Katina Taragani by the reactionary Greek government. The telegram said: "We are shocked to learn that the reactionary Greek government has sentenced Katina Taragani, leader of the Greek Democratic Women's League, to death. The women of Hebei Province are extremely indignant. This despicable act by the reactionaries only shows their death throes. History proves that no reactionary government's butcher knife can stifle the will of the people to strive for freedom. We deeply hope that you will continue your efforts, unite closely with the democratic forces of the Greek people, and fight to the end to stop the Greek reactionary government's unreasonable and sinful verdict against Taragani."

　　全国文联发表抗议书
    痛斥雅典法西斯罪行
  　冀省民主妇联声援希腊妇女
    【本报讯】中华全国文学艺术界联合会发表抗议书，严重抗议雅典保皇法西斯对希腊人民革命领袖的野蛮的死刑判决。该抗议说，我们代表全国文学艺术团体和全国文学艺术工作者，抗议这一无法无天的法西斯血案，并要求立即取消这一无理判决。中华人民共和国的人民，日日夜夜系念着被囚于雅典监狱里的希腊人民的勇士。我们知道，正如美共领袖但尼斯及澳共领袖夏基等一样，他们才是希腊文明的真正代表，他们才是全世界和平人民的战士，全世界人民知道，拯救他们，也就是拯救自己。让我们向法西斯进军的脚步声，震塌雅典监狱的屋宇。让法西斯反动势力知道，它们不但“对于自己的临近死亡感到了恐惧”，而且人民不久就将使用庄严的权力，裁判这批法西斯罪犯们。请英勇的希腊人民和你们自己的武装——希腊民主军战士们记住，全世界和平人民都是你们的兄弟，都和你们是站在一边的，自由和正义终必胜利，人民力量终必胜利。该抗议最后并引用普式庚的诗句向希腊人民的勇士们致送慰问和致敬：
    “沉重的枷锁会掉下，
    阴暗的牢狱会覆亡，
    自由会愉快地在门口迎
    接你们，
    弟兄们会把利剑送到你
    们手上。”
    【新华社北京二日电】河北省民主妇女联合会筹委会为希腊反动政府判处卡特林·塔拉甘尼的死刑一事致电希腊民主妇女联盟。电文说：“惊悉希腊反动政府判决希腊民主妇女联盟领袖卡特林·塔拉甘尼的死刑，我河北全省妇女愤慨异常。反动派这种卑鄙行为，只不过表明他们的垂死挣扎。历史证明：没有一个反动政府的屠刀能扼住争取自由人民的意志。深望你们再接再厉，与希腊人民民主力量紧紧团结，为制止希腊反动政府对塔拉甘尼的无理的罪恶的判决斗争到底。”
