Xinhua News Agency, Prague, October 31st: A grand military parade celebrating the 31st anniversary of Czechoslovak independence was held in Prague on the morning of the 30th. Before the parade began, Czech President Gottwald delivered a radio address to the armed forces and the entire Czech people. Gottwald first emphasized that without the October Revolution and the liberation of Czechoslovakia by the Soviet Red Army, there would have been no Czechoslovak independence on October 28th. The Czech President then described the most significant international events of the year: (1) the unprecedented upsurge of the world peace and democracy movement led by the Soviet Union; (2) the founding of the People's Republic of China; (3) the founding of the German Democratic Republic; (4) the exposure of the traitorous conspiracy of the Rajk gang in Hungary; (5) the Soviet Union's possession of atomic weapons. He pointed out that these major events have further strengthened the Czechoslovak people's confidence in building socialism. The Czech President then cited the brilliant achievements of economic construction in 1949 (the first year of Czechoslovakia's Five-Year Plan), stating that industrial production from January 1st to the end of September had already fulfilled 101.8 percent of the annual plan. Agriculture has achieved a bumper harvest, farmers have also completed the amount of grain sold to the state, and the people's supply level has greatly improved. Trade with the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries has increased by 30 percent. The enemy's dream that Czech industrial production would fail and the people would have no food has been shattered. He praised the Czech intellectuals for actively participating in socialist construction, pointing out that the relationship between the church and the state has been resolved. At the end of Gottwald's speech, enthusiastic cheers of "Long live President Gottwald" and "Long live Marshal Stalin" resounded throughout the venue. The military parade then began, with large formations of air force, large contingents of paratroopers, hundreds of various types of tanks, hundreds of various types of artillery pieces, and countless brand-new trucks and motorcycles carrying motorized infantry participating in the review. ... Nearly ten thousand armed workers' self-defense forces also participated in the review. The military parade lasted for two and a half hours, giving people a deep experience of the strong power of the new people's democratic Czech Republic.
