    Overcoming the Guerrilla Mentality in Learning
    Xiao Nan
    Not long ago, I fantasized about becoming a writer: dwelling in my narrow personal world, my joys, sorrows, and everything else became "articles." Seeing leftover broken corn bread in the dining hall, I would launch into a long discussion on the blackboard newspaper, gesticulating and lecturing people. At night, when my classmates were asleep, I would write; during class, when my classmates were concentrating on the lecture, I would also write. Soon after, I became enthusiastic about painting and sculpture, fantasizing about becoming an artist: literature is a teacher of life, and if you can't appreciate it, it's not fun enough, so it's better to engage in art, which is more relaxed and enjoyable. Also, not long after, merely "not long after," I suddenly felt that my general knowledge was too poor, especially when discussing current affairs, I was always tongue-tied, which was not "dignified," so I plunged into piles of newspapers and magazines, fantasizing about becoming a minor current affairs expert in the group of students... Just like this, I freely wandered around in the field of learning, knowing that there would be no gain, and feeling that this was a serious problem of liberalism in learning, but I still adopted a laissez-faire attitude and did not further consider how to overcome it.
    Deng Naiping was expelled from the Party, and the leadership seized on this issue to have us conduct ideological self-criticism. Through self-examination and discussion with comrades, I found the source of my liberalism in learning:
    1. Coming from a landlord family, I was influenced by the ideas of "flashy but impractical" and being a "talented scholar," feeling that knowing a little about everything from ancient times to the present was enough to give off the air of a "talented scholar" and show off in the crowd. Therefore, I was looking everywhere in my studies, wanting to grab a little bit of everything.
    2. I did not establish the viewpoint of serving the people, and therefore did not integrate fervent political beliefs into every practical action, so I constantly dreamed personal dreams and followed my own interests.
    3. Therefore, I aimed too high and did not study according to the needs of the development of the revolutionary situation, often setting myself apart from the masses, thinking that participating in the revolution meant standing out. For example, when my classmates were studying basic revolutionary theory, I complacently said, "Hey, I read those books before liberation!" As for whether I understood those "books" that I supposedly "read" before liberation? Could they be applied in practice? I rarely thought about it. When the revolutionary situation required us to honestly "start from scratch," this point that I thought was "advanced" compared to others had in fact already fallen behind the development of the revolutionary situation. ...
    All of these are dishonest attitudes. From now on, I must resolutely overcome this guerrilla mentality in learning and learn everything for the service of the people. First, I will systematically study the revolutionary knowledge that I lack most.

    克服学习中的游击作风
    萧南
    不久以前，我曾幻想着做一个文学家：辗转在个人的狭窄的小天地中，于是喜怒哀乐皆成“文章”了，看到饭厅里剩了碎窝头，便在墙报上大发其议论，指手划脚的教训人。晚上，同学们都睡了，我在写；上课的时候，同学们都在专心听讲，我也在写。不久以后，我又热中于绘画和雕塑了，幻想着做一个艺术家：文学是生活的教师，不能欣赏，也是不够好玩的，不如搞搞艺术来得轻松愉快。也在不久以后，仅仅是“不久以后”，我又突然感到自己一般的知识太贫乏了，特别是谈论时事问题时，我总是张口结舌，这是不“体面”的，于是又钻在报纸杂志堆里去了，幻想着做一个同学群中的小时事专家……。就这样在学习的领域中自由的游来荡去，明知不会有什么收获，也感到这是一个学习上犯自由主义的严重问题，可是我仍然采取自流的态度，没有进一步的思索如何克服它。
    邓乃平被开除党籍了，领导上抓紧这个问题要我们进行思想检讨，经了自己和同志们的研究，找出了学习上犯自由主义的来源：
    一、出身于地主家庭，受了“华而不实”和“才子”思想的影响，觉得上下古今都略知一二才够“才子”的派头，可以在人群中显耀自己，所以在学习上东张西望的，那儿都想抓一把。
    二、没有树立为人民服务的观点，也就没有把炽热的政治信仰贯穿到每一实际行动中去，所以不断地做着个人打算的梦幻，一味随自己的兴趣所至。
    三、因此也就好高鹜远，不根据革命形势发展的需要而学习，常把自己在群众中特殊化起来，认为参加革命就是出人头地了。例如：当同学们都在学习基本的革命理论时，我却沾沾自喜地：“嘿，那些书我在解放前就看过了”！至于所谓的在解放前“看”的那些“书”究竟懂不懂？能不能在实际中运用？却很少想过。在革命形势要求我们老老实实的“从头学起”时，我自以为比人“先进”的这一点，事实上已经是丢在革命形势发展的后头了。……
    所有这些，都是不老实的态度，今后我要坚决地克服这种学习上的游击作风，一切为人民服务而学习。首先针对自己最缺乏的革命知识，有计划的进行学习。
