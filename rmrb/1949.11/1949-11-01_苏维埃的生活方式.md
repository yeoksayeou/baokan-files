　　The Soviet Way of Life
    By A. Surov, Translated by Min Junqiang

　　I. The Tedious "American Way of Life" Tune

    Lately, the tiresome propaganda "tune" of the "American way of life" has been frequently utilized not only by American radio broadcasters but also by ordinary well-to-do political peddlers. The keyboards of American typesetting machines are weary from the annoying score of this tune, and its tedious broadcasting sounds have been irritating the working people of the West for years.

    One of the authors of this tune, the despicable Mr. Dulles, shamelessly declared: "The American way of life cannot but evoke mass imitation on the European continent."

    The infamous journalist Lippmann, a shameless man who works for money, immediately supported Dulles, saying: The twentieth century should be clearly called the American century!

    Familiar tune! In this sentence, we can easily recognize the old Göbbels refrain – "Germany's century," "Germany above all." Dubious "novelty"! We have heard such melodies before, and now new authors are playing them according to the old Fascist tunes.

    No matter how you try to name it, imperialism is still imperialism. It brings workers only poverty, only despair, only aversion and hatred towards labor, only pain.

    The modern American is a person tormented by imperialism. His way of life – either bitterly and obediently conforming to hellish existence, or resolutely resisting.

    Despair shrouds Westerners. The specters of hunger, war, and death lie across their path.

    Spiritual emptiness – this is the fate of people in the bourgeois world, if they obediently follow the laws of the "American way of life."

    The "American way of life" – this is a further development of the old world of man exploiting man, a standardization of consistent oppression and gradual slaughter of laborers for the sake of the profits of dozens of billionaires. This "way of life" does not, and cannot, bring any innovation or benefit to the laborers. It simply tightens the grip of oppression, and intensifies the greed for profit. The "entrepreneurs" who plunder American laborers now want to plunder the people of the world even more. They are attempting to make their millions of dollars come not only from the cents earned by labor but also from pennies (British currency), francs (French currency), and pfennigs (German currency). It is precisely for this reason that the phrase "American way of life" was concocted; it is precisely for this anti-human purpose that hypocritical words are spoken, unprincipled pens are scribbling, shameless magazines are published, and bought-off broadcasters are proclaiming….

　　II. Soviet People Live in a New Way

    Today, people all over the world inevitably compare the Soviet and American paths – the Soviet and American ways of life.

    People all over the world see that we Soviet people never force our views on anyone. We have no need to plunder markets, or fill the earth with military bases, or buy other governments, enslaving their people.

    Our Soviet way of life proves itself. In our lives and all our habits, in industrial production or rural areas, in science and culture, in the characteristics and views of Soviet people, for the first time in history, the characteristics of such a society appear – a society that the best minds of mankind have dreamed of for centuries – the characteristics of communism.

    In the Soviet state, the Bolshevik Party has nurtured people never before seen in human history. Soviet people live in a new way, Soviet people have opened up horizons for the working people of the world.

    Comrade, examine our country with the eye of your mind! Think of its people – those by the smelting furnaces, at the controls of powerful aircraft, in the fields of collective farms, on mountain pastures, in laboratories, and in the halls of city Soviets, in the dense forests of Siberia and the citrus groves of Krasnodar! Look again at the eyes of the working comrades! Do you recall encountering eyes darkened by fear and pain? Think: do you know many people who are afraid to think about the future? No, there are no such people on our land!

    Courage, fortitude, and the will to strive for victory – these are the general hallmarks of the people of the Stalin era. The bright and great goals indicated by the Party of Lenin and Stalin; dedicated service to the interests of the people; a sense of responsibility to the socialist motherland; fearlessness and mercilessness towards enemies; the ability to overcome any difficulty; the ability to honestly and unassumingly critique one's own endeavors; and to practice self-criticism – these are the qualities of the people cultivated by the Party. These people have transformed the face of our country, these people are the vanguard of all humanity. Their labor, their creation, their culture, their life – this is the Soviet way of life.

    Our courageous optimism is tempered in struggle; it arises from the great fighting ideas of Lenin and Stalin, which guide us towards communism.

    Our deep belief in a bright future is created by the Soviet reality of today. We see the extraordinary greatness and prosperity of our country, see its brilliant creativity. We constantly feel the great warmth of our people. We remember Stalin's words: "...great warmth only arises for great purposes." We know: the great purpose is approaching, because our warmth is always increasing.

    Only the blind or the enemy cannot see the future before us. Only a foolish villain cannot understand that under the Soviet way of life, the worker is not a servant, not an oppressed person, not a slave, not an appendage to a machine; but the owner, designer, and commander of his own machine, the poet of his own labor.

    The Soviet way of life ignites the eyes of workers with the light of inspiration and happiness. The Soviet way of life broadly opens the path for workers to engage in political affairs, filling their hearts with confidence and a sense of strength. The Soviet way of life actively and constantly unites workers with science, and even makes them creators of science. Our workers – are politicians and scholars, people who constantly absorb new knowledge, and who have the freest and most realistic access to all the joys of culture, art, sports, and recreation. Their nature is deeply concerned with everything connected with the cause they are flesh and blood with – building communism. The new state of life of the workers and the new face of their lives, the new face of Soviet factories, residences and families, come from this.

    In the Stalin Automobile Factory in Moscow alone, 5,606 rationalization proposals were implemented last year, all proposed by workers, technicians, and engineers. These were suggestions for improving Soviet automobiles, increasing speed, and improving quality. This saved 15 million rubles – a surplus for the state.

    If you go to the Stalin Factory, you can see for yourself where this money is spent. The factory has dozens of good kindergartens, children's sanatoriums, and Young Pioneer camps, which house a total of 2,500 children. There is a magnificent Palace of Culture, with a library containing 160,000 books, a theater, thirty art and science groups, lounges, its own sports organization, its own stadium; in addition, there are rest homes and sanatoriums near Moscow and on the coast of Riga; its own institutions of higher learning—specialized night schools with departments of automation and engineering... Seven thousand workers are university students! Two thousand workers are studying foreign languages!

    This is the Soviet way of life! All this is given by people's own labor.

　　III. Laborers Create a New Life

    The great Stalin said: "The reality of our production plan is millions of laborers creating a new life."

    Yes, it is millions! Millions of people confidently march towards communism, millions of people have forever shed selfish instincts and are creating the happiness of the people!

    Miner Nikolai Trofimov, a Hero of Socialist Labor, completed a five-year plan of coal production with his drilling machine in three years.

    "By the end of the year," he said in May, "I will complete two years' worth of production! I have fallen in love with my career, I am an enthusiastic person!"

    Everyone knows: Trofimov kept his word. Everyone knows that following Trofimov are dozens, hundreds, and thousands of miners who are increasing labor productivity, revising plans, quickly abandoning technical standards that are already outdated in modern times, they are all enthusiastic people. Indifference to labor is an obsolete and alien concept in our country.

    Labor competition has become an impetus in our lives. The mechanic of the Vladimir locomotive depot, Sergei Fedotov, made the speed of the train reach 690 kilometers in one day and night. His comrade Kondratiev broke this record: 720 kilometers in one day and night, and Fedotov replied with a new record - 760 kilometers.

    This record is no longer a record now; it has become a joyful fact of everyday life, it has become the daily routine of the Vladimir locomotive depot and all highways, and it has spread throughout the entire railway network of our great motherland.

    We do not conceal the achievements of production; each of our achievements will open the way for many more achievements, instead of depriving them of their bread, as in the West. It is precisely for this reason that constant technical breakthroughs are taking place in our country, and millions of people are seeking new possibilities, new discoveries, and new methods to achieve success.

    The close brothers of the workers—the peasants of our country—are also following the same path. Not only weather reports excite them, but also the achievements of Donbass miners, the model metallurgists of the Urals, and the lawsuit by American reactionaries against the leaders of the American Communist Party. Their minds have long been studying complex issues such as increasing harvests, enriching the soil, agricultural electrification, and grassland afforestation. They read the books of Marx and Engels, Lenin and Stalin, Pushkin and Lomonosov, Michurin and Williams, Mayakovsky and Fadeyev, Dokuchaev and Lysenko, they maintain close ties with the state seed selection centers, and they have moved into the vast fields of science, creation, and culture.

    Twenty years ago, a girl from a collective farm heard for the first time about a machine that had never been seen before, called a tractor, when she had just founded an agricultural cooperative.

    "Tractor? What does it look like?" asked Basha Angelina.

    Last year, the "October" magazine published a brief memoir by this female tractor driver. Her name is now not only famous in the Soviet Union, but also known abroad. Angelina recalled that in 1929, she did not know what a tractor was. In 1930, she became the first female tractor driver in the country, and in 1933, she was already leading a team of female tractor drivers. By 1934, her work had almost doubled the planned cultivated land. In 1935, she saw the great Stalin at the Congress of Collective Farm Strikers in Moscow. Comrade Stalin said to her: "Cadre, Comrade Angelina, cadre!"

    Thus, in the village of Starobeshevo in Ukraine, a unique "tractor special school" was established, and the Moscow newspapers reported Angelina's experiences in detail to the Soviet people….

    Angelina called out: "One hundred thousand women as tractor drivers!" Immediately, two hundred thousand female villagers responded to her call and became tractor drivers.

    Tractor driver Balichenko, after reading Academician Williams's "Fundamentals of Agriculture," said: "Now, when I know the function of grass, husks, and the application of the ploughshare, I cannot remain indifferent to how the grass is handled in the collective farm, and whether the plough assigned to me has a front ploughshare. If the plough assigned to me does not have a front ploughshare, then I will buy one with my own money, and I will definitely use a plough with a front ploughshare to plough the land!"

    These words do not need detailed commentary.

　　IV. Happy People

    The reforms that have passed in the villages are amazing and beautiful. "Russia, poor Russia!" written by Alexander Blok, wasn't it a long time ago? Wasn't it a long time ago when he sighed about his "poor cottage?"...

    Comrades, let me tell you about an area! In the Polevskoy district of Sverdlovsk Province, no house has not been burning with electric lights for thirty years. There was not a single electric light in this district before. Now, there are 750 kilometers of electric wires, two high-voltage substations, and fifty-four low-voltage substations. Here, threshing and grain cleaning have been completely electrified in all collective farms. At the same time, many collective farms have switched to using electric tractors for plowing. There is a cinema in every village Soviet. Every house has a radio, electric stove, electric iron, and electric heater. Collective farm members' families must have these things. Collective farm youths are preparing to electrify all agricultural work and are enthusiastically studying physics, electrical engineering, and radio engineering...

    This is by no means a special case.

    I have before me a small book about a village called "Great." This book was published in Yaroslavl Province, and the number of copies published is not that many, and its author, Bobrov, only chose a simple task for himself: to briefly and truthfully describe the life in an ordinary collective farm village.

    Before the revolution, the peasants in this village often died as a whole family. At that time, this place was completely ruled by landlords and hunger, gendarmes and death. Now, the dilapidated cottages and houses here have changed greatly and have been surrounded by flourishing orchards. Power stations, livestock sheds, water towers, repair shops, rural clubs, libraries, middle schools and agricultural schools, animal breeding and construction technical schools, post offices, telegraph offices, radio stations, nurseries, kindergartens, hospitals, and maternity hospitals have been built...

    Now, on the fields of this village, there are dozens of agricultural machines, there are movies in the club, there are performances by drama, music, chorus, and dance troupes, and there is a library with more than 12,000 books, with more than 1,000 regular readers. In one year, 4,000 people attended lectures and reports at the collective farm club.

    All these facts are facts of our new life.

    This simple booklet also reports to us that the income of the collective farm in this "Great" village has increased fortyfold from 1936 to now! It also tells us that in the past ten years, 300 collective farm members from the "Great" village have immediately applied this education to the daily life of the village after completing secondary or higher education. Students from schools or universities not long ago have returned to the collective farm and become agronomists, livestock breeders, builders, and technicians...

    The motherland, the Party, and the great Stalin place new and new goals before us, and our people respond to the leader's outstanding designs and wise and discerning instructions with new and more vigorous labor.

    The Party set a plan for restoring and developing the national economy in the Five-Year Plan. Millions of laborers responded by exceeding the plan, and tens of thousands of people are already doing the work of the "next Five-Year Plan."

    The Party set huge plans for forest planting and agricultural irrigation in the Five-Year Plan, as well as the fight against drought and crop failure. The Party stipulated this plan for fifteen years. However, the people here are wholeheartedly thinking about exceeding the plan. The Soviet people have immersed patriotic enthusiasm in this plan.

    "We will complete the plan in ten years!" some people said.

    "We will complete the afforestation plan in eight years!" others replied.

    Comrades! Our life is going on like this, and there cannot be other styles. Because each of us knows that the implementation of Stalin's plan will bring happiness to all the people; everyone has seen with their own eyes how our beautiful land is growing, how it is full of strength, and how it is getting better day by day.

    By implementing Stalin's plan, we create our own happiness. Soviet people have never experienced a loss of confidence in the future, have never known the fear of unemployment, and have never tasted the pain of loneliness. The story about the "American way of life" seems ridiculous and pitiful.

    Our ruble is constantly consolidating, but no one, anywhere, will use our ruble to buy human souls and human labor. When we know that new price reductions and new improvements in our lives and happiness have been achieved, we understand that this is what we have achieved ourselves!

    You, comrade, will achieve this happiness when you work beyond the plan that day, when you save raw materials, time, and money for your country, when you learn and teach others to work more efficiently, faster, and better. You, comrade, will achieve this happiness when you complete a lathe, plant new trees, study new wheat or new livestock, and when you complete new forward steps in any area of the national economy, science, and culture necessary to the people.

    Our road has never been without obstacles or easy. But precisely for this reason, we have learned to cherish our happiness extraordinarily, and at the same time, we ruthlessly hate the enemy, similar to weeds, fruitless flowers, "drifters," and people who have no connection with the motherland, love, labor, and social struggle—this is alien to us.

    We deeply oppose the vestiges of the past that are still hidden in our lives. This is the residue of the old bourgeois habits. This is the remnant of the imperialist system now named the "American way of life."

    When a cunning philistine sneaks into our ranks with dishonorable conspiracies, when he yearns for personal achievements and despises public happiness, the Soviet people will angrily expose this liar, this mold that grows in our clean house. The Soviet people know that this is the spiritual colleague of the author of the poor American book "From Pennies to Millions." When bookworms who cling to ancient and dying knowledge crawl out and start talking some delirium about cosmopolitanism in the world of science, the Soviet people correctly guess that this contains the true partner of the American commercial bandits. They promote the policy of "open doors" and dream of destroying all the borders of the world with bloody war hands. When the remaining bourgeois nationalists of any color raise their heads somewhere, we, the Soviet people, know that this is the dirty spiritual branch of American lynchers.

    For the vestiges of bourgeois habits that still exist in some dim minds, for these perishable things, for the fragile germs of this "American way of life," we have no place for them here, and there will be no place for them in the future!

　　V. The Brilliant Image of Communism

    Comrade, take a look at the workshop! The work there is boiling, and the rate of labor and the quality of products are growing day by day. There, standing next to the machine, next to the smelting furnace, next to the billet steel, and next to the conveyor belt, are trustworthy, enterprising, creative, and friendly people.

    This is——the Soviet way of life.

    You go to the fields, the work teams of the collective farm are competing, where unprecedented grains are being harvested; the agronomists there are watching the sowing, and at the same time, the high-pitched singing is leisurely ringing. On the collective farm grasslands, herds of fine breeds are grazing. There are groups of afforestation workers on the grassland, and the dikes are being re-repaired on the river bank.

    This is——the Soviet way of life.

    You go to visit the bright classrooms in schools, university lecture halls, and reading rooms in public libraries. You can see dozens or hundreds of greedy young eyes, you can see young people who love books and love science, and you can see young people who have opened the curtain of the future.

    All of this——is the Soviet way of life.

    It takes a real poet to fully and clearly describe our motherland, to write out all its novelty and excellence. Wherever you go, comrade, you can see the characteristics of communism everywhere, the characteristics of the new century.

    Near the podium of the mausoleum, in the halls of the Supreme Soviet, in the vast fields and theater boxes, in the resorts of the Black Sea and the ice and snow of Altai – everywhere are free and united Soviet people. In our unity, there is strength that the world does not yet know. The Party leads us, and it opens up the only path to happiness for us. Stalin leads us, and everything tells this story.

    Our enthusiastic and deep Soviet patriotism, our loyalty to responsibility, and our love of labor—all start from this, and we—are exceptionally close to the great goal. We protect, sing, and praise the Soviet way of life, and we regard it as the brilliant image of approaching communism!

### 苏维埃的生活方式

专栏：

　　苏维埃的生活方式
    Ａ·苏罗夫著  民君强译
　　一　无聊的“美国生活方式”小调
    近来，令人厌烦的“美国生活方式”的宣传“小调”，不只在美国无线电广播员口中，而且也被一般殷实的政治贩子们时常利用着。美国排字机的键盘，都由于这小调的可厌的乐谱而疲倦了，它的无聊的广播的声音，已经几年来都在激怒着西方的劳动人民。
    这种小调的作者之一，卑鄙的达列士先生曾厚颜不惭地宣称：“美国的生活方式，不能不在欧洲大陆上唤起群众的仿效。”
    恶名昭彰的新闻家李普曼，他是一个为了赚钱而不知羞耻的人，他立即支持达列士说：二十世纪应该明确地称为美国的世纪！
    熟习的典调！我们在这句话中，很容易认出旧的皆别里索夫的叠句——“德意志的世纪”，“德意志高于一切”。可疑的“新奇”！我们已经听到过这样的旋律了，现在新作者又按照古老的法西斯蒂调子演奏着。
    无论你怎样想尽方法称号它，帝国主义却仍然是帝国主义。它带给工人的只有困穷，只有绝望，只有对劳动的厌恶与憎恨，只有痛苦。
    现代的美国人，是被帝国主义折磨着的人。他的生活方式——或是辛酸地顺从地狱般的生活，或是坚决地反抗。
    绝望笼罩着西方人。饥饿、战争、和死亡的魔影，横在他们的路上。
    精神的空虚——这就是资产阶级世界上人的命运，如果他驯顺地服从“美国生活方式”的法则的话。
    “美国生活方式”——这是人剥削人的旧世界更进一步的发展，这是为了数十个亿万富翁的利润，对劳动者一贯的压榨和逐渐残杀的标准化。这种“生活方式”，没有，同时也不可能给劳动者带来任何革新，任何好处。很简单地，只是压迫的力量束得更紧些，对利润的贪心也愈炽烈些。掠夺美国劳动者的“事业家”们，现在更想掠夺全世界的人民。他们企图使自己的数百万金钱，不仅来自劳动获得的森特（美国分钱），而且要来自辨士（英币）、萨其姆（法币）和布非尼哥（德币）。正是因此，才想出关于“美国生活方式”这句话；正是因为这个反人类的目的，所以伪善的言词在述说着，没有原则的笔在响着，无耻的杂志在出版着，被收买的播音员在宣讲着……。
　　二　苏维埃人以新的方式生活着
    在我们今天，全世界人民不可避免地比较着苏维埃的和美国的两条道路——苏维埃的和美国的两种生活方式。
    全世界人民看到了，我们苏维埃人从不以自己的生活观点强迫任何人。我们并无必要掠夺市场，或以军事基地布满地球，或收买其他政府，奴役其人民。
    我们的苏维埃生活方式的本身就证明着自己。在我们的生活和一切习惯中，在工业生产或农村中，在科学及文化中，在苏维埃人的特性及观点中，历史上第一次地出现了这样社会的特质——数世纪来人类最优秀的智慧曾幻想过的社会——共产主义的特质。
    在苏维埃国家中，布尔塞维克党抚育了人类历史上未曾有过的人。苏维埃人以新的方式生活着，苏维埃人给全世界的劳动者，打开了视界。
    同志，你用思想的眼光审视一下我们的国家吧！想一想它的人民一在熔矿炉旁的，在威力的飞机驾驶舵旁的，在集体农场田野的，在山上牧场的，在实验室中的，以及在城市苏维埃大厅中，在西伯利亚密林和克罗西达橘林中的人吧！你再看一下劳动着的同志们的眼睛吧！你回想一下：你遇到了因恐惧和痛苦而忧郁着的眼睛吗？你想想：你知道有许多害怕想到未来的人吗？没有，我们的土地上，是没有这样的人的！
    勇敢、刚毅、争取胜利的意志——这就是斯大林时代人的一般标志。列宁、斯大林的党所指示的光明的伟大的目的；对人民的利益而热诚地服务；对社会主义祖国的责任感；对敌人的无恐惧而无怜悯；能够克服任何困难；能够正直地不自负地批判自己的事业；以及对自己实行自我批评——这就是由党所锻炼的人民的品质。这样的人变换了我国的面貌，这样的人是全世界人类的先锋队。他们的劳动，他们的创造，他们的文化，他们的生活——这就是苏维埃的生活方式。
    我们的勇敢的乐观主义，是在斗争中锻炼出来的，它产生在引导我们走向共产主义的列宁、斯大林的伟大战斗的思想中。
    我们对于光明的、未来的深刻信念，是由于今日苏维埃的现实创造出来。我们看到我国的异常伟大与富强，看到它的灿烂的创造力。我们时时都感到我们人民的伟大热力。我们记得斯大林的话：“……伟大的热力，只是为了伟大的目的而产生的。”我们知道：伟大的目的已临近了，因为我们的热力总是在增长着。
    只有盲人或敌人在我们的面前才看不到将来。只有愚蠢的坏蛋才不了解：在苏维埃生活方式下，工人不是仆役、不是被压迫的、不是奴隶、不是机械的附属品；而是自己机器的所有者、设计者和指挥者，是自己的劳动的诗人。
    苏维埃的生活方式，以鼓舞和幸福的光，点燃了工人的眼睛。苏维埃的生活方式，为工人广泛地打开了从事政治事业的道路，使他心中充满了信任和力量的自觉。苏维埃的生活方式，积极地、经常地使工人与科学结合，更甚而使他成为科学的创造者。我们的工人——是政治家和学者，是经常吸取新知识，有最自由地和最现实地得到一切文化、艺术、运动和休息的快乐的人。他的天性，对于一切和他血肉相连的事业——建设共产主义——都有关系的，都是十分关心。工人的新生活状态和他们生活的新面貌、苏维埃工厂、住所和家庭的新面貌，就是由此而来的。
    只在莫斯科的一个名叫斯大林的汽车工厂里，去年一年就实现了五千六百零六件合理化建议，这些建议都是由工人、技术人员和工程师提出的。这些是使苏维埃的汽车改善工程、扩大速度和提高质量的建议。这节约了一千五百万卢布——国家的盈余。
    你如果到斯大林工厂去，你就可以亲眼看到，这些钱是用到哪里去了，工厂设有数十个好的幼稚园、儿童疗养院、儿童团野营，这些地方共收有二千五百个儿童。有高贵的文化宫，它附设一个藏有十六万册图书的图书馆，有剧院，有三十个艺术及科学小组、休息室，有自己的体育组织，有自己的运动场；此外在莫斯科附近及里加的海滨还有休息所及疗养院；有自己的高等学校—有自动机械系和工程学系的专门夜校……七千名工人是大学生！二千名工人在学习着外国语！……
    这就是苏维埃的生活方式！这一切都是人们自己的劳动所给予的。
　　三　劳动者创造着新的生活
    伟大的斯大林说：“我们生产计划的现实性，就是数百万创造着新的生活的劳动者。”
    是的，这是数百万！数百万人充满信心地走向共产主义，数百万人永远地摆脱了自私的本能并创造着人民的幸福！
    矿工尼古拉·特罗菲莫夫，社会主义劳动英雄，在三年之中，以自己的穿孔机完成了五年计划的煤产。
    “到年底时，”他在五月时说：“我还要完成二年的产额！我爱上了自己的事业，我是一个热烈的人！”
    大家全都知道：特罗菲莫夫是尊守他的话的。谁都知道，跟踪着特罗菲莫夫的，有数十、数百以及数千矿工，他们提高劳动的生产，修订计划、尽快地废弃了在现代已是陈旧了的技术标准，他们都是热烈的人。对劳动的漠不关心，在我们国内已是陈腐的陌生的观念了。
    劳动竞赛，已成为我们生活中的一种冲动。伏拉基米尔机关车库的机械手，塞尔该·菲道特夫，使一昼夜的车头行驶速度达到六百九十公里。他的同志康得拉基也夫打破了这个纪录：一昼夜行驶七百二十公里，菲道特夫却又以新纪录回答了他——七百六十公里。
    就是这个纪录，现在已经不再是纪录了；它已成为日常生活中的快乐的事实，它已成为伏拉基米尔机关车库和一切公路的日常生活状态，同时它也传播在我们巨大祖国的一切铁路网中。
    我们不隐匿生产的成就，我们的每一件成就，就会给许多的成就打开了道路，而不象在西方似的是会夺取了他们的面包。正是因此，在我国进行着经常的技术的突击，数百万人都在寻求着达到成功的新可能、新发见和新方法。
    工人的亲兄弟——我国的农民——也走着同样的道路。不仅气象报告使他们激动，同时顿巴斯矿工的成就、乌拉尔的模范冶金工人，和美国反动派对美共领袖的诉讼事件，也激动着他们。他们的头脑，早己就研究着提高收获、丰富土壤、农业电气化和草原植林等复杂问题了。他们读着马克思和恩格斯、列宁和斯大林、普希金和罗曼诺索夫、米邱林和维利亚姆斯、玛耶可夫斯基和法捷耶夫、多古查耶夫和李森科的书籍，他们和国家的选种所保持密切的联系，他们已走向科学、创造、文化的巨大领域中。
    二十年以前，集体农场的一位女郎，在刚刚创立了农业组合时，才第一次地听到了从来未有的机器，叫做拖拉机。
    “拖拉机？什么样子的呢？”名叫巴沙·安格利娜的问。
    去年在“十月”杂志上，曾刊登了这位女拖拉机手的简短的回忆录。她的名字现在不仅在苏维埃国内有名，而且已是驰名于国外了。安格利娜回忆说：在一九二九年时，她还不知道什么是拖拉机。一九三○年她就成为国内第一个女拖拉机手，一九三三年已经率领着一队女拖拉机驾驶员了，到一九三四年工作几乎超过计划耕地的一倍。一九三五年，在集体农场庄员突击员大会上，在莫斯科看到了伟大的斯大林。斯大林同志向她说：“干部，安格利娜同志，干部！”
    于是在乌克兰，在斯塔罗·白沙瓦村，独创地设立了“拖拉机专门学校”，同时莫斯科的报纸，把安格利娜的经验，详细地报导给苏维埃人……。
    安格利娜曾号召：“十万妇女做拖拉机驾驶员！”立刻却有二十万女庄员，响应她的号召而做了拖拉机手。
    拖拉机手巴利琴科，在读过科学院学士维利亚姆斯的“农业学基础”一书后说：“现在，当我知道了草、壳皮和应用犁辕的作用时，对于集体农场中怎样处理草，以及派我去耕地时，给我的犁有没有前辕的事，我就不能淡然处之了。如果给我的犁没有前辕，那我就用自己的钱买一个，我一定用带有前辕的犁去耕地！”
    这些话用不着详细的注释。
　　四　幸福的人们
    村庄中经过的改革，是惊人而优美的。亚历山大·布罗克所曾写的：“俄罗斯，穷困的俄罗斯！”不是很久了吗？他叹息他的“可怜的茅屋”时，那不是已经很久了吗？……
    同志们，我向你们叙述一个地区吧！在斯维尔得罗夫省的包列雅尔斯基区，这区内刚刚过了卅年，已经没有一间房子不是在燃着电灯了。这区内从前没有一盏电灯，现在有七百五十公里电线，有两所高压变电所和五十四所低压变电所。这儿，在一切集体农场中，打谷和清谷已完全电气化了。同时许多集体农场，已经改用电气拖拉机犁地了。每一个村苏维埃中一有电影院。每所房屋中一有无线电收音机、电炉、电熨斗、电气暖炉已成为集体农场庄员家庭的必备品了。集体农场的青年，准备着使一切农业工作电气化，而狂热地研究着物理学、电工学和无线电学……
    这全然不是一个特殊的例子。
    我面前有一本叙述关于叫做“伟大”村的小书。这本书出版于雅罗斯拉夫省，出版的册数也不算多，而它的作者包布罗夫也只给自己选择了简朴的任务：只简明而确实地叙述了一个平凡的集体农场村庄中生活的情形而已。
    革命前这个村庄的农民，常常全家地死去。那时这里完全由地主和饥饿、宪兵和死亡全权统治着。现在，这儿原有的半毁坏了的茅舍、房屋已经大大变样了，已经围绕着繁茂的果树园了。已建起了发电所、牲畜棚、贮水塔、修械所、农村俱乐部、图书馆、中学和农业学校、动物饲养及建筑技术学校、邮局、电报局、无线电分台、托儿所、幼稚园、医院、产科医院……
    现在，在这个村庄的田地上，有数十驾农业机械，俱乐部中有电影，有戏剧、音乐、合唱和舞蹈团的表演，还有一个图书馆，内藏书籍一万二千余册，经常有一千以上的读者。在一年之中，在集体农场俱乐部出席讲演及报告的就有四千人。
    这全部事实，是我们新生活的事实。
    这本简单的小册子，还报导给我们这名叫“伟大”村的集体农场收入，从一九三六年到现在增长了四十倍！它还告诉我们，在最近十年以来，有三百个“伟大”村的集体农场庄员，在完成了中等或高等教育之后，立刻把这种教育应用到村庄的日常生活中。不久以前的学校或高等学校的学生们，回到集体农场就成为农业家、牲畜饲养家、建筑家及技师……
    祖国、党和伟大的斯大林把一切新而又新的目标置于我们面前，我们的人民，以新的更有力的劳动回答领袖的卓越的设计、智慧而明敏的指示。
    党在五年计划中，设置了复兴并发展国民经济的计划。数百万劳动者以超出计划来回答，并有成千成万的人已经在做着“下一个五年计划”的工作。
    党在五年计划中，设置了巨大的种植森林和农业灌溉计划、以及抵抗旱灾及歉收的斗争。党规定这个计划为十五年。但是，此地的人民却一心一意地想超过计划。苏维埃的人民，已把爱国的热情浸沉在这个计划中了。
    “我们要在十年完成计划！”一部分人说。
    “我们要在八年时间内完成植林计划！”另外一些人回答。
    同志们！我们的生活是这样进行着，且不可能有其他的样式。因为我们每个人都知道，实现斯大林的计划，会给全人民带来幸福；每一个人都亲眼看到，我们的优美的土地是怎样生长着，怎样充满了力量，怎样一天天更好起来。
    执行斯大林的计划，我们创造着自己的幸福。在苏维埃人面前，从未经历过对未来丧失信心，从来不知道失业的恐惧，从未尝过孤独的痛苦。关于“美国生活方式”的故事，是显得可笑而又可怜。
    我们的卢布，时时在巩固着，但是，无论任何人在任何地方，也不会用我们的卢布，收买人类的灵魂和人类的劳动。当我们知道了新的减低物价，及我们的生活和幸福获得新的改善时，我们明白，这是我们自己达到的！
    你，同志，当你工作超过了计划那一天，当你给自己的国家节省下原料、时间和金钱的那一天，当你自己学会并教给别人更有效、更快、更好地工作时，你就会达到这种幸福。你，同志，当你完成了镟床，植上了新树，研究出新种小麦或新种牲畜时，以及在任何人民必需的经济、科学及文化领域，完成了新的前进步骤时，你也会达到这种幸福。
    我们的道路，从来不是没有阻碍或轻易的。但正因如此，我们才学会异常珍贵自己的幸福，同时无情地憎恨敌人，类似杂草、无实花、“浮浪花”，以及与祖国、爱情、劳动和社会斗争没有联系的人——这对我们是陌生的。
    我们深刻反对还隐藏在我们生活中的过去的遗迹。这是旧的资产阶级习惯的残余。这是那现在被命名为“美国生活方式”的帝国主义制度的残迹。
    当一个狡猾的俗人，以不名誉的阴谋，潜入我们的行列中，当他热望着个人的成就，而轻视公共幸福时，苏维埃人就会愤怒地揭发这个骗子，这个长在我们清洁房屋中的霉菌。苏维埃人知道：这是可怜的美国书“由分钱到百万”的作者的精神同僚。当拘泥于古老的、垂死的知识的书虫爬出来，并开始述说一些关于科学无国境的世界主义的谵语时，苏维埃人正确地猜出，这其中蕴藏的却是美国商业匪徒的真正伙伴。他们宣传着“门户开放”的政策，幻想着用血腥的战争的手，毁掉世界上的一切国境。当残余的任何色彩的资产阶级民族主义者在某处抬起头来时，我们，苏维埃人民知道：这是美国私刑者的肮脏的精神支脉。
    对于有些昏暗的头脑里依然存在的资产阶级习惯的残迹，对于这些易朽的东西，对于这些“美国生活方式”的脆弱的细菌，我们这儿没有它们的位置，将来也不会有！
　　五　共产主义的光辉形象
    同志，你看看工作间！那儿工作沸腾着，那儿劳动的速率和产品的质量一天天生长着。那里，站在机器旁，熔矿炉旁、分块钢旁以及在传送装置旁边，有着可信任的、富于倡导性的，富于创造性的和友爱的人们。
    这是——苏维埃的生活方式。
    你走到田野里，集体农场的工作队在竞争着，那里正在收割着前所未有的谷物；那里的农业家们正在注视着播种，同时，高吭的歌声在悠然地响着。在集体农场的草地上，牧放着良种的畜群。草原上有成群的植林家，河岸上又重新修整着堰堤。
    这是——苏维埃的生活方式。
    你去访问学校中光明的教室、大学讲室及公共图书馆的阅览室吧，你可以看到数十数百贪婪的青年的眼睛，你可以看到爱书籍爱科学的青年，看到揭开了未来幕帷的青年。
    所有这一切——是苏维埃的生活方式。
    需要做一个真正的诗人，以充分地清晰地描写我们的祖国，写出它的一切新奇与卓越。无论你出发到那里去，同志，到处你都可以看到共产主义的特征，新世纪的特征。
    在陵墓的讲坛附近，在最高苏维埃大厅中，在广阔的田野和剧院的厢座中，在黑海的避暑地和阿尔泰的冰雪中——到处是自由的、到处是团结的苏维埃人。在我们的团结中，是世界上尚且不知道的力量。党领导着我们，它给我们开拓了唯一走向幸福的道路。斯大林领导着我们，一切都叙述着这件事。
    我们的热烈的、深刻的苏维埃爱国主义，我们对责任的忠诚，对劳动的爱——都是由此出发，我们——已经异常接近了伟大的目的。我们保护着、歌颂着、赞美着苏维埃的生活方式，把它当做临近的共产主义的光辉形象！
