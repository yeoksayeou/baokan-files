Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 12th—The business of state-owned orchards in the Jiaodong area of Shandong Province is developing daily, and private orchards are also gradually recovering with the assistance of the People's Government. The soil, climate, and rainfall in Jiaodong are all suitable for fruit tree cultivation. The apples in Yantai and Longkou, the pears in Laiyang, and the grapes in Dazeshan are all very famous in this area. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, large quantities of fruit were exported. After the war, due to the destruction and sabotage by the enemy, puppets and Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, most of the orchards were left desolate. Last autumn, the Shandong Provincial People's Government began to restore the orchards. Over the past year, seven state-owned orchards have been established in Yantai, Weihaiwei, Laiyang and other counties, as well as one fruit tree guidance center and one guidance station. Currently, the types of fruits produced by the state-owned orchards in Jiaodong include: apples, crabapples, flowering crabapples, cherries, grapes, peaches and pears. Some state-owned orchards have begun to implement enterprise-style scientific management. For example, the Longkou Fruit Tree Guidance Center uses an eight-horsepower water pump to irrigate the orchard. Over the past year, the state-owned orchards in Jiaodong have also actively assisted private orchards in various places to carry out restoration work. For example, the Longkou Fruit Tree Guidance Center organized a Fruit Tree Research Committee to provide specific guidance to farmers on pruning fruit trees and spraying pesticides. According to statistics for the first half of this year alone, more than 1,300 kilograms of pesticides were sold, and more than 500 fruit tree households were helped to spray 840 mu of orchards, reducing the mortality rate of fruit trees by 80% compared with the past. The Laiyang East County State-owned Fruit Tree Station also cooperated with village governments in various regions to establish fruit tree protection committees to educate people to cherish fruit trees; at the same time, it also established fruit tree experimental zones, focusing on cultivating fruit tree demonstration households to promote orchard development.

　　山东果园逐渐恢复
    【新华社济南十二日电】山东省胶东区公营果园的业务日益发展，私营果园在人民政府扶助下也逐渐恢复。胶东土质气候和雨量均适于栽培果树。该区烟台、龙口一带的苹果。莱阳的梨，大泽山的葡萄，都很出名。抗战前水果大量出口，战后由于敌伪蒋匪的摧残破坏，逐使大部果园荒芜。去年秋天，山东省人民政府开始进行了恢复果园的工作。一年来在烟台、威海卫、莱阳等县先后成立了公营果园七处，果树指导所及指导站各一处。目前胶东公营果园出产的水果种类有：苹果、海棠、花红、樱桃、葡萄、蜜桃及梨。部分公营果园已开始实行企业化的科学管理，如龙口果树指导所利用八匹马力的抽水机浇园。一年来胶东公营果园还积极帮助各地私人果园进行恢复工作。如龙口果树指导所组织果树研究委员会，具体指导农民群众修剪果树及喷射药剂。仅今年上半年的统计：共推销药剂一千三百余斤，帮助五百余户果树户喷射了八百四十亩果园，使果树的死亡率比过去减低百分之八十。莱东县公营果树站也协同各地区村政府成立果树保管委员会，教育人民爱护果树；同时还成立了果树实验区，有重点地培养果树示范户，进行果园推广工作。
