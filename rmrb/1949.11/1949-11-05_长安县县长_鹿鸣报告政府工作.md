Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 4th: Chang'an County Magistrate Lu Ming reported on the government's work in the four months since liberation at the People's Representative Conference of all circles in the county, as follows:

　　I. On Supporting the Front Lines:

　　After the liberation of Xi'an, the government mobilized all its forces to support the front lines, which became the most important task of the Chang'an County government at that time. In June alone, it completed borrowing 128,660 *shi* of grain, mobilized 1,072 long-term carts (over a month), 3,216 animals, 508 short-term carts, 1,016 animals, 505 stretchers, 2,980 team members, and temporarily mobilized more than 600 carts and about 300 laborers. In the newly liberated Chang'an New District, the main reason for completing such a large task of supporting the front lines was that the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army received enthusiastic support from the masses. However, due to the short time, insufficient cadres, and the temporary retention of old *baojia* personnel in districts and townships, the policy of reasonable burden could not be fully implemented, resulting in biases such as seizing the big heads or average apportionment in grain borrowing.

　　II. On Building the Army and Suppressing Bandits:

　　Because no armed forces were organized when we initially took over, emphasizing army building became the most urgent requirement. Up to now, the county's local armed forces have about 2,000 people. Among them, poor and lower-middle peasants account for about 86%, middle peasants for about 23%, and rich peasants for 0.3%. This armed force has grown and strengthened in combat, with more than 20 battles of varying sizes, eliminating more than 120 scattered bandits and handling more than 230 stray soldiers and vagrants. In army building, due to the small number and weakness of cadres, and insufficient mastery of policies, a few bad elements took the opportunity to infiltrate, committing wrongdoing and violating mass discipline.

　　III. On Building Political Power and Maintaining Public Security:

　　When Chang'an was liberated, very few cadres came from the old liberated areas, so in the initial stage, old *baojia* personnel were temporarily used. Subsequently, people's political power was gradually established at both the district and township levels. The basic policy for building political power is to mobilize the masses, discover activists in the process of mass movements, and establish the people's own political power. Before liberation, Chang'an was consistently a stronghold of enemy, puppet, and reactionary forces, with many reactionary organizations, bandits, and special agents. After liberation, nearby villages were often attacked by scattered bandits, which had a great impact on social security and public morale. The main shortcomings of political power building and public security work during this period were that some areas were always hesitant and afraid to boldly mobilize the masses and cultivate activists to quickly transform political power, or although political power was initially transformed, it lacked contact with the masses. Public security work was also only carried out by a small number of cadres and did not become a mass movement. County Magistrate Lu Ming then explained in detail the work in culture and education, finance, economy, and takeover, and put forward the following three major tasks for future work:

　　Three Major Tasks for the Future

　　(1) Do a good job in building the army, clearing out scattered bandits, and consolidating public security. In the future, local armed forces should strengthen training on the existing basis, purge individual bad elements, raise political awareness, and establish a preferential treatment system for the families of soldiers. In the work of eliminating bandits, political disintegration and military suppression should be carried out simultaneously. First of all, we must widely publicize our policy of "punishing the chief culprits, not questioning the coerced, and rewarding meritorious service" towards bandits and special agents, eliminate the concerns of the masses, mobilize the masses to report bandits and special agents, universally establish self-defense forces, register special agents, register households, and send stray soldiers and vagrants back to their hometowns to engage in production.

　　(2) Do a good job in grain requisition. Our grain requisition is not average apportionment, but reasonable burden, with the poor contributing less and the rich contributing more. According to the statistical materials of 14 townships in the first grain requisition, it proves that 90% of the people support grain requisition. However, if the land area is not accurate, even if the policy is very correct and the cadres are very active, it will be difficult to achieve reasonableness. Therefore, it is hoped that all representatives, after returning this time, should carefully publicize the policy of reasonable burden and persuade all farmers to truthfully report their land area and yield.

　　(3) Do a good job in economic construction. At present, the most urgent task is to do a good job in wheat planting and autumn harvest. In order to improve the farmers' production enthusiasm and break some concerns among some farmers, we should vigorously promote the publicity of policies such as land reform, rent reduction and interest rate reduction, and reasonable burden. It should be explained that the reduction of rent and interest will absolutely not affect the middle peasants, and even in land reform, it is absolutely not allowed to infringe upon the middle peasants, so the middle peasants can boldly expand production. In the future, interest rates can be freely negotiated when lending. Even landlords and rich peasants are given a way out; each of them will obtain an equal share of land as the peasants, and as long as they work hard to reform themselves, they will have a future. Therefore, land must not be allowed to lie fallow. Poor and lower-middle peasants have a guarantee of emancipation, and today they should actively engage in production and oppose the incorrect sentiment of sitting and waiting for land distribution to turn themselves around.

　　Two Central Keys

　　County Magistrate Lu Ming said: "To do the above tasks well, there are two central key issues: The first is to universally mobilize and organize all the masses, thoroughly eliminate bandits, defeat the power holders of the landlord class, establish our own political power, and establish the dominant force of the peasants. The second is to strengthen cadre learning. Only when the quality of cadres is improved can they better lead the masses to complete the tasks given by the higher authorities."

### 长安县县长　鹿鸣报告政府工作

　　长安县县长
  　鹿鸣报告政府工作
    【新华社西安四日电】长安县县长鹿鸣在该县各界人民代表会议上报告解放后四个月来的政府工作如下：
  　一、关于支援前线方面：
    西安解放后，政府曾动员所有一切力量支援前线，成为当时长安县政府工作最重要的任务。六月份一个月内即完成借粮十二万八千六百六十石，动员的长期大车（一个多月的）一千零七十二辆，牲口三千二百一十六头，短期大车五百零八辆，牲口一千零一十六头，担架五百零五付，队员二千九百八十人，临时动员大车六百辆以上，民工三百人左右。在刚解放的长安新区，能完成这样大的支援前线的任务，主要原因是共产党和人民解放军获得群众的热烈拥护，但由于时间短促，干部不够，区乡暂时留用旧保甲人员，不能完全贯彻合理负担的政策，所以在借粮中产生了抓大头，或平均摊派等偏向。
  　二、关于建军剿匪方面：
    由于初接管时尚未组织武装，因此强调建军，成了最迫切的要求。到现在，全县地方武装已有二千人左右。其中贫雇农约占百分之八十六强，中农百分之二十三强，富农百分之零点三。这一支武装，从战斗中生长和壮大，大小战斗凡二十多次，消灭散匪一百二十多名，处理散兵游勇二百三十多名。在建军中因干部少而弱，政策掌握不够，有少数坏分子乘隙钻入，为非作恶，违犯群众纪律。
  　三、关于建政、治安方面：
    长安解放时，从老区来的干部很少，所以在初期是暂用旧时之保甲人员，继后逐步建立区乡两级人民政权。建政基本方针是发动群众，在群众运动的过程中发现积极分子，建立人民自己的政权。长安在解放前一贯是敌伪反动据点，反动组织和土匪特务很多。解放后附近乡村常被散匪行动，这对社会治安和人心安定影响很大。这一时期的建政、治安工作，主要缺点为部分地区总是束手束脚，不敢大胆发动群众，培养积极分子以迅速改造政权，或政权虽初步改造，但与群众联系不够，治安工作也是只由一部分干部来作，没有成为群众性的运动。鹿鸣县长继就文教、财政、经济及接收工作等方面详加说明之后，对今后工作提出下列三大任务：
    今后三大任务
    （一）做好建军、清剿散匪和巩固治安工作。今后地方武装应在现有基础上，加强整训，清洗个别坏分子，提高政治觉悟，并对参军家属建立优待制度。在肃清土匪的工作中以政治瓦解与军事清剿同时并进，首先要广泛宣传我们对土匪特务“首恶必办，胁从不问，立功受奖”的政策，消除群众顾虑，发动群众检举土匪特务，普遍建立自卫军，登记特务人员，登记户口，遣送散兵游勇回籍生产。
    （二）做好征粮工作。我们的征粮不是平均摊派，而是合理负担，穷的不出少出，富的多出。根据第一次征粮中十四个乡的统计材料，证明百分之九十的人民是拥护征粮的。但如果地亩不确实，虽然政策很正确，干部很积极，也难于作到合理。所以希望各位代表这次回去后，应好好宣传合理负担政策，说服所有农民实报地亩及产量。
    （三）做好经济建设工作。目前最迫切的就是做好种麦秋收。为了提高农民的生产情绪，打破一部分农民中的某些顾虑，应大力展开土地改革、减租减息、合理负担等政策的宣传。应该说明在减租减息中绝对动不了中农，即到土地改革时，也是绝对不许可侵犯中农的，所以中农可以大胆地扩大生产。今后借贷时，利息可以自由议定。就是对地主富农也是给予生活出路的，他们每个人都将取得和农民相等的一份土地，只要好好劳动改造自己就有前途。所以田地决不能任其荒芜。贫雇农有了翻身保障，今天更应积极生产，反对坐待分地翻身的不正确情绪。
    两个中心关键
    鹿鸣县长说：“要把以上几件工作做好，有两个中心关键问题：第一是先把所有的群众普遍发动和组织起来，彻底消灭土匪，打垮地主阶级当权派，建立自己的政权，树立农民的优势力量。第二是加强干部学习。只有干部质量提高了，才能更好地领导群众来完成上级所给予的任务。”
