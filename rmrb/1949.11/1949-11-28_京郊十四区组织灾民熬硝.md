　　Fourteen Districts in the Suburbs of Beijing Organize Disaster Victims to Boil Saltpeter
    [This Newspaper News] This year's flood in the fourteen districts of the suburbs of Beijing is severe, with a total of 25,493 people affected by the disaster in the district. In addition to vigorously helping disaster victims plant wheat, the district government also called on them to carry out a large amount of saltpeter boiling and various sideline productions in the autumn and winter slack season in conjunction with land reform. In order to solve the difficulties of utensils and food for saltpeter boiling households, the district cooperative has adopted a pre-purchase method of paying first and then giving saltpeter, and has now pre-purchased more than 7,000 catties. In more than ten villages including Yinghaizhuang, Guangdezhuang, and Xihongmen, there are 60 large pots starting to boil saltpeter, and it is estimated that more than 10,000 catties of saltpeter can be produced every day. The profits earned can solve the living problems of 6,000 people. The district cooperative has also found sales channels in factories in Tianjin and other places, and there will be no problem with sales by next spring.

　　京郊十四区组织灾民熬硝
    【本报讯】京郊十四区今年水灾严重，全区受灾群众达两万五千四百九十三人。该区政府除大力扶助灾民种麦外，并号召在秋后冬闲时结合土地改革工作进行大量熬硝和各种副业生产。区合作社为解决熬硝户用具及粮食困难，并采用先付款后给硝的预购办法，现已预购七千余斤。仅瀛海庄、广德庄、西红门等十余村，即有六十口大锅开始熬硝，估计每日可出硝一万余斤。所赚红利即能解决六千人的生活问题。区合作社并在天津等处工厂找好销路，熬到明年春天，销路已不成问题。
