Vice Minister Lü Dong Proposes Defining Seven Types of Norms

    At the end of the meeting, Comrade Lü Dong, Vice Minister, spoke, focusing on how to implement quota management in carrying out this movement. He pointed out: Currently, the Ministry of Industry requires all factories and mines to gradually determine the following types of norms in the movement to create new records: 1. Determine equipment norms. We must calculate equipment capacity and truly calculate equipment utilization norms, so that we can find ways to fully utilize our existing equipment. In the past, we did not pay enough attention to equipment utilization rates. Today, we must study and improve on the basis of the new record movement and find the production volume of a certain piece of equipment in a certain period of time. 2. Norms for the consumption of raw materials, materials, fuel, and electricity. Today, we must implement the principle of saving under the premise of ensuring product quality and find quotas. This requires using fewer raw materials to make better products. 3. Norms for improving labor productivity – a comprehensive norm for staffing and output. That is, how much can one person produce each month or year? Improve one step from the current level, and study personnel quotas and output quotas from the perspective of labor productivity. Here, we must disseminate the experiences of advanced enterprises and advanced workers. This is a very important organizational work and is absolutely necessary in the movement to create new records. To do this, we must study the issue of working hours, analyze working hours well, and propose methods to improve labor efficiency. 4. Quality norms: Ensure that any product meets specifications and guarantees its use value. Therefore, in making technical norms, we must combine it with the work of reducing or eliminating waste products; and formulate a plan to eliminate waste products. 5. Cost norms: The concentrated expression of good or bad work in industrial production is the level of cost. Therefore, we must strive to reduce the four basic components of production costs (wages, materials, management fees, depreciation). We want to create new records for reducing costs. 6. Basic construction norms (engineering construction). This year, the management of construction is relatively chaotic, and a lot of waste has occurred. We must also create new records in this area and find norms. In the future, the Ministry of Industry will use advanced construction experience and the norms that have been created to remove unreasonable parts. 7. Working capital norms (working capital turnover rate norms). This requires all factories and mines to conduct in-depth research on how to accelerate the turnover rate of funds and how much working capital should be available, and requires all units to create new records in this area and formulate plans for the turnover rate of funds. Regarding how to formulate norms, he pointed out: This is a result of creating new records. We must create new records in many aspects, because new records are long-term, so we must review and revise them regularly, formulate them through this mass movement, and formulate them based on the experience of advanced enterprises and advanced workers. This formulation is not based on the average norms of past experience statistics (that is, the average amount produced in the past), which is to follow the backward, but between the norms of advanced producers and the current norms, to formulate reasonable norms. Finally, he called on all factories and mines to immediately launch the movement to create new records in all aspects for the production plan next year, so that it will prepare an infinite reserve of resources for future industrial production.

　　吕东副部长提出确定七种定额
    会议最后，由副部长吕东同志讲话，他着重提出了在开展这一运动中如何实行定额管理。他指出：目前工业部要求各厂矿在创造新纪录运动中逐步确定以下几种定额：一、确定装备定额。要计算设备能力，真正计算设备利用定额，以此使我们想办法来充分的使用我们现有的装备。过去我们对设备运用率注意的不够，今天要在新纪录运动的基础上研究提高，找出一定设备一定时间的生产量来。二、原料、材料、燃料和电力消耗的定额，今天要在保证产品质量提高的原则下，贯澈节约计划找出额来。这就是要求用更少的原料做出更好的东西来。三、提高劳动生产率的定额——定员定量综合的额。即是指一个人每一月或一年能生产多少东西？从现有水平上提高一步，从劳动率上来研究人员定额及产量定额。在这里就要传播先进企业、先进工作者的经验。这是一个很重要的组织工作，在创造新纪录运动中十分必要。想这样那就必须研究工时问题，很好分析工时，从中提出提高劳动效率的方法。四、质量定额：要保证任何一个产品都要合乎规格，保证其使用价值。因此在做技术定额中一定要结合着减少或消灭废品这一工作；并订出消灭废品的计划。五、成本定额：工业生产中工作好坏集中的表现是在成本高低上。因此要在生产成本的四个基本组成部分上（工资、材料、管理费、折旧）去努力减低。我们要创造降低成本的新纪录。六、基本建设定额（工程建设）。今年在修建管理是比较乱的，浪费不少，这也要创造新纪录，找出额来，将来工业部要根据先进的建设经验及已创出的额，核掉不合理的部分。七、流动资金定额（资金周转率定额），这要求各厂矿在如何加速资金周转率及应当有多少流动资金问题上很好研究，要求各单位也在这方面创造新纪录，作出资金周转率的计划来。关于如何制订定额，他指出：这是创造新纪录的一个结果，要从这许多方面去创造新纪录，因为新纪录是长期的，那就要定期审查修改，通过这一群众运动来制订，根据先进企业及先进工作者经验来制订。这个制订不是根据过去经验的统计的平均定额（即如过去生产的平均额）来订，那是向落后看齐，而是介乎先进生产者的定额与目前的定额之间，订出合理的定额。最后他号召所有厂矿为了明年的生产计划，要立即把创造新纪录运动从各个方面开展起来，这样便会给今后工业生产准备了无限的后备源泉。
