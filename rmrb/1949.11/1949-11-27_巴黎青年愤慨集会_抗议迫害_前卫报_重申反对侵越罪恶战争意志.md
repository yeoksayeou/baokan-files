Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 26th: According to a TASS report from Paris: The incident of the French reactionaries illegally persecuting the French democratic youth weekly "Avant-Garde" has aroused the indignation and protests of French youth.

　　On November 23rd, the 17th court of the Seine province actually interrogated and fined "Avant-Garde" because it had written articles opposing the criminal war waged by French colonists in Vietnam. The court further announced that it would re-examine the newspaper on December 15th because the newspaper had published an article claiming that "French youth will never participate in a war against the Soviet Union."

　　On the same day that the court interrogated Avant-Garde, a mass youth rally was held in Paris to protest the illegal persecution of the newspaper. Standing on the podium were G. Ducolon, Secretary of the French Republican Youth League, Bohesson, Chairman of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, Marti, a member of the Political Bureau of the French Communist Party, and Mello, editor of "Avant-Garde." In addition, there were representatives from youth organizations in Italy, Hungary, Romania, Vietnam, and other countries. Marti and Mello both delivered speeches at the meeting, exposing the reactionary purpose of the reactionaries' illegal persecution of Avant-Garde, which was to forcibly suppress the democratic voices of France. Marti declared: "The morale of the soldiers is not being undermined by the youth weekly, but because the French government itself illegally sent them to participate in the criminal war in Vietnam and to suppress strikes." Mello declared: "We will do our best to strengthen the friendship between France and the Soviet Union, and we will never fight against Soviet youth."

　　巴黎青年愤慨集会
    抗议迫害“前卫报”
  　重申反对侵越罪恶战争意志
    【新华社北京二十六日电】据塔斯社巴黎讯：法国反动派非法迫害法国民主青年周刊“前卫报”的事件，已邀起法国青年的愤慨与抗议。
    十一月二十三日，塞纳省第十七号法庭竟因“前卫报”曾撰文反对法国殖民者在越南进行的罪恶战争，而审讯该报并处以罚金。法庭更宣布将于十二月十五日再度审讯该报，因为该报曾刊载一篇论文，声称“法国青年永远不会参加对苏联的战争”。
    就在法庭审讯前卫报的当天，巴黎举行了抗议非法迫害前卫报的青年群众大会。站在讲台上的有“法兰西共和青年联盟书记G·杜科朗、世界民主青年联盟主席鲍埃逊、法国共产党政治局委员马尔梯、“前卫报”编辑梅罗等，此外，还有意大利、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、越南及其他国家青年组织的代表。马尔梯和梅罗都在会上发表演说，揭露反动派非法迫害前卫报的反动目的，是意图用强力压抑法国的民主呼声。马尔梯宣称：“兵士的士气并不是被青年周刊所败坏，而是由于法国政府本身非法地送他们去参加罪恶的越南战争和镇压罢工所致。”梅罗宣称：“我们将尽力增强法苏间的友好，我们将永远不会对苏联青年作战。
