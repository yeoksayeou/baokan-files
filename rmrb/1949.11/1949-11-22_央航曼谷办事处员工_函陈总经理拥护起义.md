Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, November 21st: All employees of the China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) Bangkok office in Siam recently sent a letter to General Manager Chen Zhuolin in Beijing, expressing their absolute support and vowing to remain at their posts to protect the company's assets in Bangkok. The original letter reads in part:

　　"All colleagues at the Siam station, upon reading the joint telegram from you and China National Aviation Corporation General Manager Liu on November 9th, announcing that all employees of both companies will henceforth break away from the Kuomintang regime, return to the country for rehabilitation, and assist in national construction, and after reading the declaration of the company's national employees, we were overjoyed. As the Siam station is located abroad, far across the ocean, although our colleagues at the station were unable to participate in the uprising in a timely manner, none of us do not look to you for guidance. In addition to signing our names to express our absolute support, we are determined to remain at our posts and do our best to preserve all assets of the Siam station, awaiting instructions. Respectfully submitted for your consideration: He Jingliang, Sun Kun, He Zhiqin, Ding Kaifa, Yu Jinshan, Ma Siwei, Huang Lixin, Zhuang Diqiao, Wu Xuezhai, Li Jiahao, Cai Jinchang, Cai Ruqiu, Zhan Shijin."
