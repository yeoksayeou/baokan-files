In the temple, Ju Bao fabricated a story about how Da San didn't believe in Lord Lao, how he jumped around making trouble, how he had no respect for anyone, and how he wanted to destroy the big kiln and the entire Zhang family of Hun Village. He secretly told everyone, "That guy is worse than an animal! This... Hey, guess what? He even wanted to make a play for my Bai Quan's wife!" He paused, sighed for a while, and finally said that Xi Lu had contributed to opening the kiln, but letting Da San go was wrong. After speaking, he pushed Liu Er Wu and said, "That's the whole story! I've explained it, let the community leaders decide! Anything is fine, I'm easy, I always go along with everyone." But no one spoke up, only Qian Da Nao ran back and forth, saying a few words to this person, then running over there, whispering and gesturing to that person. Some people nodded, some whispered a few words, and Qian Da Nao would then discuss with Ju Bao in a low voice. In turn, he frowned and babbled to Xi Lu, speaking and gesturing for a long time. Xi Lu felt wronged and resentful, and his heart ached, unable to speak. Finally, Ju Bao opened his mouth and said, "We've discussed for quite a while! Everyone's ideas are pretty much the same, let me say a few words and see if it matches everyone. I think this matter, Da San has already left! Anyway, he has offended Lord Lao! Such a wicked thing has come out of our Zhang family, there's no way to call him back, so we won't pursue it! He will have his retribution in the future. Xi Lu should still take care of opening the kiln. These days, Xi Lu's finances are really tight. I'll run errands to Liu Gou to borrow some help and scrape together enough money to go to the city to invite Shui Shang Piao or Zhua Xin Dan to perform three plays, and hold three tables of banquets to pay respects to Lord Lao, and incidentally invite guests. All the community leaders of Hun Village will go to the temple to kowtow three times to Lord Lao, and Xi Lu will make a wish to the temple, and that's it. Today, we came to the temple to reason, Da San should have taken care of the food, drink, and expenses, but he's not here, fortunately, the amount is not much, Xi Lu will take care of it! Da San still has two rooms and some bedding and furniture, confiscate them to cover the expenses of the performance. What do you all think?" Some people said softly, "Okay!" Some were still silent, and Ju Bao glared at them one by one. The people, meeting his red eyes, were afraid in their hearts, and hurriedly said, "Okay! Let's do it this way!" Ju Bao looked at Xi Lu again, and Xi Lu also hurriedly replied, "Okay! Whatever you old man says!" Saying that, he stammered, "It's just this kiln..." Ju Bao interjected, "Didn't I say everything about the kiln and the capital? As for the leader, I think Yu Bao should do it!" At this time, Yu Bao was setting the table and arranging for everyone to eat. Ju Bao asked him, "You be the leader, okay?" Yu Bao looked at the crowd and stammered, "I... I can't say! Everyone old people look... look at it!" Xi Lu then regretted that he shouldn't have let Da San leave so easily, and hated Ju Bao for being too powerful, but he was afraid of his power, and he didn't believe that Yu Bao could really do it, so he mustered up his energy and said, "Let me just give up on this kiln! Ju Bao! Look at me, I have no people, no money... Or you old man come... or everyone... I'm not the material for running a big kiln, I never thought of making it so big." Ju Bao quickly interrupted, "Hey! What are you talking about! You're doing a good job, and your reputation has spread! It looks like this kiln will only get better, and besides, this is to benefit the people, it's a matter for everyone in Hun Village, how can we give up halfway, and cause sorry for the people of Hun Village? Do it! If there are difficulties, there's me and the community leaders! Everyone says, isn't that right?" Ju Bao swept his eyes over the crowd again, and the crowd had to nod in agreement. Xi Lu had no idea what to do, so he hurriedly asked Yu Bao, "Okay? Can you handle it?" Yu Bao glanced at Ju Bao, Ju Bao ignored him, only Qian Da Nao fluttered his eyelids at him twice, and he hurriedly said, "Anyway, I'll do it with my life on the line! I pray for Lord Lao's blessing, and rely on the good fortune of Ju Bao old man and the community leaders!" Ju Bao stood up and waved his arm, asked for boiling water and took two puffs of opium pills, and said decisively, "That's it! Get moving early! Qian Da Nao, take a trip to the city to invite the troupe, and pick a date to start the show first! Yu Bao, arrange the banquet and the affairs of the temple! Xi Lu, that's it! Yu Bao, let's eat!"
That night, Xi Lu helplessly discussed with Yu Bao for a while, and felt that he had to do it, so he made a firm decision: to go all out and do it again! If it goes wrong, to hell with it! Ju Bao can't take no responsibility at all! With his mind made up, he sent Yu Bao away.
Yu Bao came out of Xi Lu's house, but secretly ran to Ju Bao's house, found Qian Da Nao and said, "I can barely manage this kiln opening, but I don't really know how to handle the ventilation pipes... I'm not very sure about the water and fire underground! What do you say to do?" Qian Da Nao stiffened his neck and said, "Are you really only capable of this much?" Ju Bao was lying on the kang in the inner room smoking opium. Hearing the conversation outside, he yelled from the other room, "Yu Bao, do you still need to ask about this? Child! Just work hard! If you do well, the kiln will be like our own! If you don't succeed, someone else is blocking the way, what else is there to say? Go! Qian Da Nao, don't nag him anymore! Go to bed early, go to the city early tomorrow morning to invite Shui Shang Piao or Zhua Xin Dan, remember?" Qian Da Nao said, "Got it!" Yu Bao also said, "Got it! I'll do as you old man told me!" After speaking, Yu Bao happily walked out, and ran into Bai Quan's wife just as she was bringing a kettle of boiling water to Ju Bao; Bai Quan's wife quickly avoided him when she saw him, but he looked at the woman twice, feeling sweet in his heart, and went straight to Niu Bao's sister-in-law's place to sleep.

 　　　　Twenty White Noise
Da San's belongings were used as collateral at the temple, handled by Qian Da Nao, to invite the famous Shui Shang Piao of the Shanxi Opera from Zhonglu to perform in the village for three days. Xi Lu himself also held a banquet, invited guests, and accompanied them to pay respects to Lord Lao. This matter spread throughout the surrounding dozens of miles, and Black Stone Slope Village was bustling for five whole days. During these days, Ju Bao worked very hard, personally selecting the plays and personally entertaining the guests; Xi Lu usually didn't have much interaction with these high-table figures, and barely learned from Ju Bao, laughing and chatting with them, listening to their praises and some of their experiences in opening kilns and getting rich. After this period passed, he and Lin Bao went to the kiln to manage the sales yard and the accounting room, and through Qian Da Nao's introduction, found Tai Cheng, who used to manage Ju Bao's earthen kiln, to be the foreman. After looking at a date, the big kiln started construction.

Yu Bao had previously discussed with Xi Lu, saying that the cost of labor and money would not be as much as Da San calculated, and Xi Lu was half-believing. Yu Bao also changed some of Da San's plans: the newly dug kiln would not be a "tuo" kiln, and the tunnels would be dug smaller, making it a "dan" kiln; and he said to Xi Lu, "Anyway, the new kiln has to be connected to the east kiln through a ventilation pipe, and having the east kiln can move livestock up and down! This saves labor and money." Xi Lu's enthusiasm for running a big kiln had not been so great at this time. Now seeing what Yu Bao was doing, he couldn't help but feel that Yu Bao was after all one of his own, and he was not without skill, so he felt more at ease, and agreed with Yu Bao's words, relying on him to do it, and sometimes he himself would go to Yangquan to take care of his small shop.

Yu Bao's allocation here was also not bad. He divided the kiln workers into three shifts, day and night, first draining the accumulated water from the big kiln and opening up the coal; then, next to the west side of the big kiln, he dug open a new kiln entrance, and saw coal after digging in five or six feet. The matter of opening the kiln that Da San entrusted before leaving, Bian Xiao told Xi Lu, Xi Lu also told Yu Bao, Yu Bao also understood a little, and at this time he also wanted to show his ability, to successfully open the kiln and be well received by both Ju Bao and Xi Lu, so he listened to those words and directed the people to dig tunnels straight to the northwest, and it was going very smoothly.

　　黑石坡煤窑演义（２１）
    康濯
    在庙上，聚宝把大三怎么不信服老君爷、怎么跳皮捣乱目中无人、怎么要毁了这大窑和浑村张姓一大家，编说了一套，又悄悄告给大伙：“那家伙可真是牲口也不如！这……嗨，你猜怎么着？他还想打我那白泉家的主意！”他停了停，叹息一阵，最后又说喜禄开窑有功，可放走大三实是不对；说完，他就一推六二五道：“缘由根底就是个这！我算是交代了，众社首们拿主意吧！怎么也行，我好说，我总随和大家。”但大家谁也不开腔，只乾大脑一个这边跑跑，跟这个说两句，又那边跑跑，跟那个咬咬耳朵打个手势；人们有的点点头，有的也悄悄说两句，乾大脑就再跟聚宝小声商议一下，回头又皱着眉头跟喜禄连说带比划地咕捣半天，喜禄只觉着又冤又恨，一阵阵心疼，有话也说不出。最后聚宝开言发话道：“商议的工夫也不小啦！大伙主意嘛也没什么出入，我说两句看跟大伙碰不碰。我看这事嘛，大三也走啦！反正老君爷他也得罪啦！咱张氏门中出了这么个孽种嘛，寻他回也没法，咱们就不追究啦！日后他自有报应的。喜禄嘛还是拾掇开窑，这些时喜禄手头也实是不宽裕，我跑跑腿去柳沟借两个帮补点，凑合着去城里请水上漂或是抓心旦来唱三台戏，再办三桌席敬敬老君爷，捎带请请客，咱浑村社首都上庙给老君爷叩三个头，喜禄再给庙里许个愿，就这算了。今个上庙评理，本该大三包揽吃喝花销的，他不在嘛，好在数目不多，喜禄就担上吧！大三还有两间房和一些铺盖家具，没收了顶唱戏的花销好了。大伙看行么？”大伙有的轻轻说了句：“行！”有的还是不言声，聚宝就瞪着眼朝一个个看；人们碰了他的红眼，心中着怕，忙道：“行！就这吧！”聚宝又眼望喜禄，喜禄也慌忙答道：“行！你老人家说的嘛！”说着，他又吞吞吐吐道：“只是这窑……”聚宝插道：“窑跟垫本我不是都说了么？领事嘛，我看就叫玉宝干吧！”这时玉宝正摆设碗筷张罗大伙吃饭，聚宝就问他道：“你当领事，行么？”玉宝望望众人，也吞吞吐吐道：“我可……可不敢说！众位老人家看……看着吧！”喜禄这时又后悔自己不该让大三轻易走了，又恨聚宝太厉害，可又怕他的威势，再说自己还不信玉宝真能行，就鼓着劲说道：“我这窑拉倒了吧！聚宝！你看我人没人钱没钱的……要不你老人家来……或是众人……我也不是个滚大窑的材料，我原本也没想闹这么大的。”聚宝忙插嘴道：“嗨！你这是什么话！你干得好好地，名声也出去啦！眼看这窑也只有好没有赖，再说，这也是与民谋利，是咱浑村大伙的事，还能半路丢啦，再闹个对不起浑村百姓么？干吧！有困难嘛，有我跟众社首们！大伙说，不是么？”聚宝又眼对大伙一扫，大伙只得点头称是；喜禄没了主意，只得慌忙问玉宝道：“行么？你拿得住谱谱么？”玉宝瞟了聚宝一眼，聚宝没理他，只见乾大脑对他扑展了两下眼皮，他忙道：“反正我破着命干吧！求老君爷保佑，托聚宝老人家和众社首的洪福吧！”聚宝立起来一挥胳膊，要开水喝了两粒烟丸，就斩钉截铁地说：“就这！赶早动弹！乾大脑，你跑趟城请请班子，看个日子先开戏！玉宝张罗办酒跟庙上的事！喜禄，就这吧！玉宝，开饭！”
    当天黑夜，喜禄没奈何地找玉宝捣拉了一阵，觉得不干不行，就拿了个准主意：豁出去再干一场！若是干坏了，管球它！聚宝反正不能一点也不担待！他主意打定，就打发玉宝走了。
    玉宝从喜禄家里出来，却又悄悄跑到聚宝家，找着乾大脑说：“这开窑我倒凑合，可透风筒我可……窑底下水火我还摸不很准哩！你说怎办？”乾大脑脖子一硬道：“当真你就这么点把式？”聚宝正躺在里间炕上抽大烟，听见外间说话，就隔房嚷道：“玉宝，你这还用问？孩子！使劲干吧！干好了，窑也就跟咱自己的一样啦！干不成嘛，有人家挡着，还有啥说的？去吧！乾大脑甭再跟他噜嗦啦！早早睡，明个早早上城请水上漂或是抓心旦，记住了么？”乾大脑道：“记住啦！”玉宝也道：“记住啦！我照你老人家吩咐的办吧！”说完，玉宝高高兴兴地走出来，又碰见白泉家正给聚宝提开水壶进去；白泉家见了他就赶紧躲过一边，他却看了那女人两眼，心中甜乎乎地，直上牛宝他嫂那睡觉去了。
    　　　　二十　白闹
    大三的家当在庙上顶了点款，由乾大脑经手，请中路山西梆子的名旦水上漂来村里唱了三天戏，喜禄自己又办了酒席请了客陪敬老君爷，这件事又传遍方圆几十里，黑石坡村也整整热闹了五天。这几天聚宝很卖力气，亲自点戏，亲自招待客人；喜禄平日没跟这些桌面上人物多打过交道，也勉强学着聚宝，嘻嘻哈哈陪人家捣拉一阵，听人家几句夸奖，也听人家一些开窑发家的经验。这阵子过去，他就又和林宝一道上窑上管卖场和柜房，并由乾大脑介绍，找了那个过去给聚宝管土窑的泰成当间工头，看了个日子，大窑就动工了。
    玉宝事先跟喜禄合计了一下，他说花工花钱要不了大三算的那么些，喜禄是半信半疑；玉宝又改变了一些大三的计划：新刨的窑不作驮窑，行道刨小些，作成个担窑；并对喜禄说：“反正新窑要跟东边大窑透过风筒的，有了东窑能上下牲口就行了！这又省工省钱。”喜禄这阵子滚大窑的劲头本没有过那么大，现在见玉宝所作所为，不免觉着玉宝到底是自己人，把式上头也不是没两下子，就安心了些，并赞同玉宝的话，靠给他干，有时他自己也还去阳泉照料照料他的小铺。
    这边玉宝拨调得也不赖。他把窑黑也分成日夜三班，先打净了大窑的存水，出开了炭；又在紧挨大窑的西边，凿开了新窑口，也是刨进五六尺就见炭。大三临走时嘱托的开窑的事，扁小告给了喜禄，喜禄也告给了玉宝，玉宝也懂点门道，这时他也想显显本领，把窑好好开成，闹个聚宝喜禄两边都吃得开的，因此也就听信了那话，指挥人们直往西北刨行道，干得还很顺利。
