　　East China Holds Water and Land Transportation Symposium
　　Implementing Planned Transportation
　　[Shanghai News] In order to solicit opinions on transportation from relevant authorities, the Transportation Department of the East China Finance and Economics Committee invited representatives from public and private water and land transportation organizations and industrial and commercial consignors to a transportation work symposium at the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company on October 27th at 1:00 PM. Xiao Weiguo, Chief of the Transportation Department of the Shanghai Railway Bureau, reported on the railway transportation situation: the Railway Bureau has implemented planned transportation starting in October and hopes that major public and private enterprises and shippers will closely cooperate with the Bureau and accurately submit the required number of wagons for the following month. Furthermore, starting next month, responsible transportation of less-than-carload (LCL) shipments will be implemented first, and after gaining experience and completing warehouse consolidation and other preparatory work, responsible transportation will be fully implemented. Regarding freight prices and classification issues, commercial transportation meetings have been successively held in Shanghai, Nanjing, Wuhu, Hangzhou, and other places to solicit opinions from local shippers. After collecting and studying these opinions in detail, they will be submitted to the Ministry of Railways for reference. Dong Huamin, the military representative of the Business Department of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, reported on the transportation volume of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company from the liberation to October 27th. The transportation volume from October 1st to October 27th has exceeded that of June by 19.7 times. Representatives expressed their support for the Railway Bureau's implementation of responsible transportation next month and hoped for the implementation of a water-land coordinated transportation system to be promoted nationwide. Gan Mei, Deputy Minister of the Transportation Department, summarized the representatives' opinions as follows: 1. Public institutions all hope to increase transportation capacity to ensure the completion of monthly consignment tasks; 2. The majority request the implementation of water-land coordinated transportation, which can reduce the cost of loading and unloading along the way and the consumption of goods; 3. Most hope to adjust or clarify the categories of freight rates, and to unify dock wages and implement a shift system for stevedores; 4. Individual requests to strengthen waterway security, construct docks, and dredge the silted sections of the Suzhou Creek riverbed; 5. Individual requests for the government to provide working capital facilities. Deputy Minister Gan Mei's response was: First, the current problem is not the lack of transportation capacity, but the lack of planning and poor organization beforehand. It is hoped that in the future, all agencies will closely contact the transportation agencies to implement planned transportation. Second, we are currently preparing to suggest to the Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Communications the establishment of a national coordinated transportation company centered on Shanghai, so that railways, highways, and shipping can all cooperate to promote the exchange of materials throughout the country. Third, fourth, and fifth points: will be considered and studied in detail.
