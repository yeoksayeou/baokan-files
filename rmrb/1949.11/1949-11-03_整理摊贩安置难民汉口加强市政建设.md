Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 2nd: The Wuhan Municipal People's Government is currently undertaking various municipal construction projects, including the consolidation of street vendors, handling refugees and beggars, and renovating roads. Since the establishment of the Wuhan Municipal Street Vendor Consolidation Committee in August, extensive publicity has been carried out to dispel the ideological concerns of the vendors. Loans are provided to help them build sheds, giving them fixed business locations. In the past two months, more than 30,000 vendors have been registered, divided into 62 market areas, and two part-time department stores, Yong'an and Wuhan, have been specially opened to accommodate small-scale businesses that cannot afford storefronts and are scattered in front of shops on various thoroughfares. Currently, all vendors have entered designated markets to conduct business, and the streets that were once crowded with vendors are now orderly. The work of handling refugees and beggars in Wuhan officially began on the 25th of last month. According to preliminary statistics, there are approximately 8,400 refugees and beggars stranded in the city. Four reception centers have now been established to conduct registration and concentration separately. Among them, more than 3,300 people have voluntarily returned to their hometowns for production. The Wuhan Municipal Refugee and Beggar Handling Committee will provide travel expenses based on specific economic conditions, dispatch special personnel to escort them, and the municipal government will issue letters of introduction and certificates of return to hometowns for production, requesting the local people's government to find ways to resettle them. Beggars who remain in the city will be assigned to designated areas for centralized management to facilitate education and transformation, gradually organizing them to engage in production or return to their hometowns for production. The first batch of repatriation work will begin at the beginning of this month. In addition, the Municipal People's Government Construction Bureau, based on the proposal of the Wuhan People's Representative Conference, began renovating and repairing four streets, including Zhongshan Avenue in Hankou, and dredging the city's underground drainage system on the 18th of last month. The street lamp and water gate management committee, composed of the Municipal Public Security Bureau and the Water and Electricity Company, has also begun its work.

　　整理摊贩安置难民汉口加强市政建设
    【新华社汉口二日电】武汉市人民政府正展开各种市政建设，先后进行整理摊贩，处理难民乞丐和翻修马路等工作。自八月间武汉市摊贩整理委员会成立后，即展开广泛宣传，解除摊贩们的思想顾虑。贷予款项，帮助他们建立棚屋，使其有固定地址营业。两个月来，共登记摊贩三万多户，划分为六十二个市场区，并特辟永安、及武汉两业余百货市场，以容纳无力辟门市而散布在各通衢店铺前的小本经营户。现各摊贩均已进入指定市场营业，过去到处拥挤着摊贩的街道，已秩序井然。武汉难民乞丐的处理工作，亦于上月二十五日正式开始，据初步统计：流落本市的难民乞丐共约八千四百余人，现已设立了四个招待所，分别进行登记和集中。其中已有三千三百余人自愿返乡生产。由武汉市难民乞丐处理委员会按具体经济情况分别发给旅费，派专人护送，并由市政府出具介绍信和回乡生产证明书，请当地人民政府设法安置。留居本市的乞丐，则划定地区集中管理，以便教育改造，逐渐组织其从事生产或返乡生产。首批遣送工作，于本月初开始。此外，市人民政府建设局根据武汉各界人民代表会议的提议，已于上月十八日开始翻修与补修汉口市中山大道等四街道，及疏理全市地下水道。市公安总局和水电公司组成的路灯水门保管委员会，亦已开始工作。
