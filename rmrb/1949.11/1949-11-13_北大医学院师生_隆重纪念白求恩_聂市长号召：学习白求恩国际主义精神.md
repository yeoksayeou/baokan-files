    Peking University Medical College Faculty and Students
    Solemnly Commemorate Bethune
    Mayor Nie Calls for: Learning Bethune's Internationalist Spirit
    [Our Dispatch] Yesterday (the 12th) marked the tenth anniversary of the death of the great internationalist, Dr. Bethune. The faculty and students of Peking University Medical College solemnly held a memorial meeting in the auditorium of Peking University Hospital at 7 p.m. last night. Li Dequan, Minister of Health of the Central People's Government, Vice Ministers He Cheng, Fu Lian＠①, Ye Qingshan, and Mayor of Beijing Nie Rongzhen, and Dean of Peking University Hospital Hu ChuanKui attended and spoke. More than 300 people attended the meeting. A huge portrait of Dr. Bethune and many slogans were hung in front of the rostrum.
    At the beginning of the memorial meeting, Jia Liren, chairman of the Student Union of Peking University Medical College, delivered a speech, saying: In the future, the faculty and students of the Medical College should learn from Dr. Bethune's spirit of serving the people's cause. Hu Chuankui, Dean of Peking University Hospital, pointed out that to commemorate Bethune, we must first learn his internationalist spirit. Minister Li Dequan made a comparison between the service stance of medical workers of the American bourgeoisie and the medical workers of the Soviet proletariat. Finally, she hoped that everyone could learn from Bethune. Mayor Nie recalled with deep sorrow and introduced the touching deeds of Dr. Bethune's hard work, going to the front lines, and tirelessly treating and rescuing the wounded during the guerrilla warfare in Wutai Mountain. Mayor Nie emphatically pointed out that the reason why Dr. Bethune was great and worthy of our learning is: (1) He first appeared on the front lines of the Spanish anti-fascist war and then on the enemy's rear battlefield in China as a proletarian fighter and a communist hero, and finally unfortunately sacrificed himself. Without a high degree of political consciousness and a great internationalist spirit, it would have been impossible to achieve such brilliant achievements. (2) He had a strong sense of career and the highest enthusiasm and greatest initiative to serve the people.
    After Mayor Nie's speech, the entire audience stood up and paid silent tribute to the great Dr. Bethune. Then, Dong Yueqian, a staff member of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, vividly reported what he had learned about Dr. Bethune's noble internationalist spirit, his realistic work style, and his high revolutionary enthusiasm when he worked with Dr. Bethune during the guerrilla warfare. Vice Minister He Cheng emphasized in his speech that Dr. Bethune's path is the path of medical workers in the new China in the future. He said that in the future, medicine can only develop if it serves the broad masses of the people. Fu Lian＠ and Ye Qingshan also spoke successively, unanimously hoping that everyone would learn from Bethune's care for the wounded and sick, and at the same time strive to learn from Soviet medical workers.

    北大医学院师生
    隆重纪念白求恩
    聂市长号召：学习白求恩国际主义精神
    【本报讯】昨（十二日）为伟大的国际主义者——白求恩大夫逝世十周年纪念，北京大学医学院师生特于昨晚七时在北大医院礼堂隆重举行纪念会。中央人民政府卫生部长李德全、副部长贺诚、傅连＠①、叶青山及北京市市长聂荣臻、北大医院院长胡传揆等均出席讲话。到会共三百余人。主席台前高悬白求恩大夫的巨幅画像，和许多标语。
    纪念会开始，首由北大医学院学生会主席贾立人致词，他说：今后医学院的师生要学习白求恩大夫为人民事业服务的精神。北大医院院长胡传揆指出纪念白求恩，首先就要学习他的国际主义精神。李德全部长把美国资产阶级的医务工作者与苏联无产阶级的医务工作者做了一个服务立场的对比，最后她希望每一个人都能学习白求恩。聂市长沉痛地回忆并介绍了白求恩大夫在五台山游击战争中艰苦工作，亲临前线，不疲倦地医治和抢救伤员的可歌可泣的事迹，聂市长着重地指出白求恩大夫的所以伟大，值得我们学习的是：（一）他是以一个无产阶级的战士，一个共产主义者的英雄姿态，最初出现在西班牙反法西斯战争的前线，接着又出现在中国的敌后战场，终于不幸牺牲了，如果没有高度的政治觉悟和伟大的国际主义精神，是不可能有这样光辉的成就的。（二）他有着坚强的事业心和为人民服务的最高热情和最大积极性。
    聂市长讲话毕，全场一致起立向伟大的白求恩大夫静默致敬。接着，由外交部工作人员董越千，生动地报告了他与白求恩大夫在游击战争中共事时所体会到的，关于白求恩大夫在工作中所表现的崇高的国际主义精神，以及工作中实事求是的作风和高度的革命热情。贺诚副部长讲话中着重地指出白求恩大夫的道路，是今后新中国医务工作者的道路。他说，今后的医学，只有为广大的人民服务，才能发展。傅连＠、叶青山亦相继讲话，一致希望大家学习白求恩对于伤病员的爱护，同时更要努力向苏联的医务工作者学习。  （柏生）
