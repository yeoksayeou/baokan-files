    The Return of Two Airlines to the Motherland is of Great Significance to Civil Aviation Construction
    [This Newspaper] The news of the uprising of all employees of the "China" and "Central" airlines has brought great joy to the Ministry of Transport. In a conversation with reporters, Minister Zhang Bojun stated that this fact proves the spirit of the Chinese people's love for the motherland and further proves that the correct leadership of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China and Chairman Mao has been widely and wholeheartedly supported by the Chinese people.
    Minister Zhang believes that the return of the two airline companies' employees and aircraft to the people's motherland is of great significance for the future development of civil aviation.

Minister Zhang said: I believe they will more clearly understand that the new China is absolutely different from the old China and will strive even harder for the construction of the people's motherland.
