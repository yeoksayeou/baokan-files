    Common Basic Laws of Economic Development in Class Society
    Social economic movement is constantly developing forward. In class society, as mentioned in the first chapter, factors such as the productive forces and the production relations that adapt to them, as well as the form of political power and science and culture, promote economic development. However, old production relations, forms of political power, and old ideologies also hinder social and economic development. Therefore, productive forces must struggle against all obstacles that cannot adapt to productive forces and restrict the development of productive forces themselves, such as old production relations. However, the development of social productive forces is not a straight line. When it encounters obstacles and restrictions from the old economy and old production relations that it cannot break through, it has to take a roundabout road (but it will not be a very long roundabout). After a certain detour, it finally breaks through the old economy, the old production relations, etc., that is, through revolutionary means, destroys the old political power, the old economy, and the old production relations, and establishes a new economy, new production relations, and a new political power to adapt to the development of productive forces and enable it to continue to develop forward. Only in this way can the economy be developed and society can progress. This is the common basic law of economic development in class society, and it is also the general basic law of class society change.
    Common Economic Laws in History and Different Special Laws in Each Era
    In social economic movement, we can see that there is a certain relationship between productive forces and production relations and the mode of production that unifies the two. At the same time, we can also see that the economy of each era, that is, the economy of the previous era and the economy of the later era, also has a certain connection. From this, we can see that there are certain laws in social economic movement, that is, certain rules. Even in socialist society, economic laws exist objectively and have objective necessity.
    Therefore, the economy is moving and developing according to its own laws (or rules). In class society, this economic law exists objectively, independently of people's will. Whether people recognize it or not, whether they are willing or unwilling, whether they feel it or not, it exists objectively in the economic movement itself and moves by itself. They are spontaneous and natural in nature. This law plays a leading and dominant role in the economy. Regardless of the economy of any era in history, any kind of economic movement is subject to the natural laws of a certain economic movement. Therefore, each era in history has its own specific economic laws that govern the economy of each era. Of course, there are economic laws that are commonly applicable to all eras in history, but we cannot think that it is enough to only understand these common laws. We must further understand the special laws of social economy in each era. For example, in any historical era, people must engage in the production of material means of subsistence in order to live, but to engage in the production of material means of subsistence, it is necessary to have two elements of production, which is a common law in any historical era. However, if we only recognize this point, it is only a hollow and abstract understanding of the economy, because the two elements of production (human and material elements) have different forms of combination in each historical era. For example, in primitive communist society, the means of production are publicly owned by society, and the owners of labor power are also the owners of the means of production, and they carry out production in such a combination form. In ancient society, not only the laborers—slaves—did not have the means of production, but even the laborers themselves—the slaves themselves—were privately owned by the slave owners. The laborers—slaves—must combine with the means of production under the management, control, supervision, and whip of the slave owners in order to carry out production. In feudal society and capitalist society, the combination of labor power and means of production also has different forms. For example, the principle that productive forces determine production relations is applicable to any society in any era in history, but if we generally and abstractly say that productive forces determine production relations, it is empty and without content. We must observe from the economy of each era and each society, or from the various economies of an era and a society, how productive forces historically and specifically determine production relations in order to have certain specific content and to have a concrete, in-depth, and vivid understanding of this principle.
    The Laws of Economic Movement in Non-Class Society
    It is necessary to specifically mention non-class societies, that is, primitive communist society and socialist society, especially the laws of economic movement in socialist society.
    In non-class society, the laws of social economic movement are fundamentally different in nature from those in class society. For example, in primitive communist society, when there was no private property and no classes had occurred or been established, the equal and consanguineous production relations at that time were adapted to the low productive forces at that time. The law of economic movement and the driving force of social development in primitive communist society at that time was the adaptation and consistency of this productive force and production relations. However, by the end of primitive communist society, due to the emergence of private property (private ownership of the means of production) and classes, and their gradual development, the contradiction and struggle between the new productive forces and the old production relations also arose, and became the original driving force of social economic movement and social development. Finally, primitive communist society declined and died, and was replaced by the higher-level ancient society (slave society).

　　第三节　经济运动与经济规律（法则）
    阶级社会经济发展的共同基本规律
    社会经济运动是不断地向前发展的。在阶级社会里促进经济发展的，既如第一章里所说的，有作为推动因素的生产力及与它相适应的生产关系，以及政权形式和科学文化等等促进经济发展的因素。而阻碍社会经济发展的，也有旧的生产关系，政权形式以及旧的意识形态等等因素。因此生产力必须要与旧的生产关系等不能适应生产力并束缚生产力本身发展的一切障碍物斗争。可是社会生产力的发展也并不是一根直线式的，当它遇到旧经济旧生产关系等的阻碍束缚不能突破时，就不得不走迂回曲折的道路（但也不会是多么长久的曲折），经过一定的迂回曲折，最后突破这种旧的经济，旧的生产关系等，即经过革命的手段摧毁旧的政权，旧的经济，旧的生产关系，建立起新的经济新的生产关系与新的政权，以适应生产力的发展，并使它不断的向前发展。并且只有这样，经济才能得到发展，社会也才能得到进步。这便是阶级社会经发展的共同的基本规律，同时也就是阶级社会变革的一般的基本规律。
    历史上共同的经济规律与各时代不同的特殊的规律
    在社会经济运动中，我们可以看到生产力与生产关系及它们两者统一的生产方式间是有着一定的关系的。同时我们也可以看到各时代的经济，即前一时代的经济与后一时代的经济，也有着一定的联系。从这里我们又可以看到社会经济运动中是有着一定的规律的，即有着一定的法则的。即使在社会主义社会里，经济规律也是客观地存在，带有客观的必然性。
    所以，经济是按照本身的规律（或法则）运动着，发展着的。在阶级社会里，这种经济规律是客观地存在着，是离开人们的意志而独立地存在着的，它不管人们认识到或者没有认识到，愿意或者不愿意，感觉到或者不感觉到，而在经济运动本身中客观地存在着，并自己运动着。它们是自发的，自然的性质的。这种规律对经济起着领导支配的作用。不管历史上任何时代的经济，任何一种的经济运动，都要受到一定的经济运动的自然规律的支配。因此，历史上各个时代都有自己一定的特殊的经济规律支配着每一个时代的经济。历史上各时代都能共同适用的经济规律固然也是有的，可是我们不能够以为只认识了这些共同的规律就足够了，我们还必须进一步认识各时代社会经济的特殊的规律。例如：任何历史时代，人们为了生活，都必须从事物质生活资料的生产，但要从事物质生活资料的生产，必须具有生产的两个要素，这是任何历史时代都是共同的规律。可是，假使我们只认识了这一点，那只是空洞的、抽象的认识了经济，因为生产的两要素（人的与物的要素），在历史上各个时代有着各个时代各不相同的结合形式。例如：原始共产社会；生产手段是社会公有的，劳动力的所有者，同时就是生产手段的所有者，他们就在这样的结合形式下进行生产。古代社会，不但劳动者——奴隶，没有生产手段，而且连劳动者本身——奴隶本身亦为奴隶主所私有，劳动者——奴隶必须在奴隶主的管理、支配、监督、鞭笞之下与生产手段结合，才能进行生产。在封建社会以及资本主义社会里，劳动力与生产手段的结合也都有着各不相同的形式。又如：生产力决定生产关系这一原则，对于历史上各时代任何社会都是适用的，但是如果我们只是一般的、抽象的说生产力决定生产关系，乃是空洞无内容的，我们必须从各个时代各个社会的经济中，或者从一个时代一个社会的各种经济中，来观察生产力怎样历史地、具体地决定生产关系，才有一定的具体的内容，才能对这一原则，有具体的、深入的、生动的了解。
    非阶级社会的经济运动规律
    这里应当特别谈到非阶级社会，即原始共产社会与社会主义社会，特别是社会主义社会的经济运动规律。
    在非阶级社会里，社会经济运动的规律，与阶级社会的有着根本的本质上的区别。例如：原始共产社会，当它还没有私有财产，没有阶级发生成立以前，当时平等的、同血族的生产关系是与当时低下的生产力相适应着的。当时原始共产社会经济运动的规律，和社会发展的动力，便是这种生产力与生产关系的适应一致。但到原始共产社会的末期，由于私有财产（生产手段的私有制）与阶级的出现，与它们逐步的发展，新的生产力与旧的生产关系的矛盾斗争，也随之而产生，并成为社会经济运动，社会发展的原动力，最后原始共产社会便没落死亡，被较高一级的古代社会（奴隶社会）所代替。
