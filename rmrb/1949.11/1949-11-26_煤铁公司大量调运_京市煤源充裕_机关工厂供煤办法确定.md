  　Beijing's Coal Supply Abundant
  　Measures for Coal Supply to Government Offices and Factories Determined
    [Beijing News] The Beijing Coal and Iron Branch Company is shipping large quantities of coal to supply various government offices, factories, military units, schools, and residents of the capital. In October and November, the branch company signed a contract with the Jingxi Coal Mine Company to purchase 130,000 tons of coal. In November, it also acquired 20,000 tons of coal from various small kilns in Mentougou. Simultaneously, since the opening of the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway, 300 to 400 tons of Kouquan coal can be transported to Beijing daily, and 1,000 to 1,500 tons of Kailuan coal can be transported monthly. In addition, coal from Xiahuayuan has also begun to be shipped. The city's coal supply this winter can be guaranteed without worry.
    [Beijing News] To ensure the supply of coal to government offices, military units, and schools in the capital this winter and to control coal prices, the Beijing Coal and Iron Branch Company, based on the current coal production and demand situation, as well as the coal consumption plans submitted by various units and the results of meetings with relevant units, has determined the following temporary supply measures: "1. Scope of supply: Supply coal for heating and cooking to government offices, military units, and schools in Beijing and suburban areas (coal for employees' families is supplied by cooperatives; industrial coal, which has always been directly purchased from the mines, will continue to be supplied by the mines). 2. Coal consumption standards: Based on the supply standards stipulated by the former North China People's Government. ① Boilers: Small-sized boilers use 300 to 600 jin of coal per day; 36-inch boilers with 8 to 10 plates use 1,100 to 1,800 jin of coal per day; 36-inch boilers with 13 or more plates use a maximum of 2,000 jin of coal per day. ② Office coal consumption: Two large offices with one stove use 25 jin of coal per day. An average of five people per office. Schools with lecture halls for 50 or more people are allowed to use two stoves; those with 100 or more people are allowed to use three stoves, and one additional stove is allowed for every 50 additional people. ③ Dormitory coal consumption: Cadres at or above the level of Provincial Government Department Heads and Directly Subordinate Municipal Bureau Directors are allowed one stove per person, using 20 jin of coal per day; general government cadres average one fire for every three people, using 8 jin of coal per day; school security teams and police average one fire for every five people, using 8 jin of coal per day. ④ Cooking coal consumption: Based on the number of people eating together, each person uses 3 jin of coal per day. ⑤ Private schools are calculated according to the standards for public schools. ⑥ Exceeding the above coal consumption standards requires the approval of the Beijing Municipal Finance and Economics Committee. 3. Supply methods: (1) Period: According to the principle of monthly allocation, supply will be provided once a month, from November 15th of this year to February 15th of next year, for a total of three months, with schools being supplied for 75 days. (2) Coal collection address: Temporarily designated as the Chaoyang, Xizhi, and Andingmen coal yards, specifically determined according to the addresses of government offices, military units, and schools. The Qianmen coal yard will not handle coal for government offices, military units, and schools due to its small site and large sales volume. (3) Coal collection period: When buying coal, the coal collection date will be agreed upon by both parties based on the conditions of the coal yard. Refunds will be issued if the coal is not collected after the expiration date. (4) Coal type: Appropriately allocated according to the various types of coal currently available at the Coal and Iron Branch Company and the actual needs of each unit. 4. Budget review: Except for departments supplied by the Central Ministry of Finance and the Beijing Municipal Finance Bureau, for which the Ministry of Finance and the Municipal Finance Bureau will uniformly prepare a coal consumption plan based on the specific circumstances of each unit according to the coal consumption standards and submit it to this branch company, all other units will be reviewed and supplied by this branch company according to the above coal consumption standards. Units that have not yet submitted a budget can directly submit a coal consumption budget to this branch company, which will review and supply it. Exceeding the above coal consumption standards requires the approval of the Beijing Municipal Finance and Economics Committee."
