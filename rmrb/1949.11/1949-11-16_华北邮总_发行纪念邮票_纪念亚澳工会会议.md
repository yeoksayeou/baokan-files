    [This City News] To commemorate the Asian-Australasian Trade Union Conference held in Beijing by the World Federation of Trade Unions, the North China Postal Administration is issuing commemorative stamps. The stamp design features the topography of the Eastern Hemisphere, displaying Asia and Australia. A fist and a hammer extend from eastern Asia, with the year "1949" on the hammer. A long flag encircles the center of the earth, with the words "Workers of all countries, unite!" written on the flag. The face values are 100 yuan (red), 300 yuan (green), and 500 yuan (blue). They are available for sale at the conference post office and post offices throughout the region starting today. The Beijing Postal Administration has also prepared a commemorative postmark. In addition to being used at the conference post office, this commemorative postmark will also be available at the Gongan Street Postal Administration, West Chang'an Street Post Office, and East Fourth Post Office to facilitate stamp collectors' cancellation of stamps.
    [Further News] To facilitate conference delegates in mailing items, the Beijing Postal Administration has established a temporary post office at the conference venue, in addition to the post office that was set up at the Hotel Wagons-Lits on the 5th of this month.
