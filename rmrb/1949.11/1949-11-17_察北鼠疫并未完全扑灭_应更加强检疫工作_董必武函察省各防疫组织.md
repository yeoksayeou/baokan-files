　　The Charbei Plague Has Not Been Completely Eradicated
    Quarantine Work Should Be Strengthened
  　Dong Biwu's Letter to Various Epidemic Prevention Organizations in Chahar Province
    [Beijing News] Dong Biwu, Chairman of the Central Epidemic Prevention Committee, sent a letter on the 16th to the Chahar Provincial Epidemic Prevention Committee, the Zhangjiakou Municipal Epidemic Prevention Committee, and the Central Epidemic Prevention Committee Epidemic Prevention Corps, instructing that the restoration of railway traffic on the Beijing-Suiyuan line does not mean the Charbei plague has been completely eradicated. Therefore, epidemic prevention work should not be relaxed. On the contrary, with the resumption of traffic, epidemic prevention propaganda and quarantine work should be strengthened. All previously established quarantine stations in the Chahar Southern area should continue to perform quarantine work at their original locations and should strengthen their operations. The Charbei epidemic area and Jijiufangzi Village in the suburbs of Zhangjiakou City must still be strictly sealed off. Normal political and economic activities can be restored within Charbei. Personnel leaving Charbei on official business must be inspected by quarantine personnel and given a certificate before being allowed to leave. In addition to specific epidemic prevention regulations for railway passenger and freight operations, the letter also stipulates that the epidemic prevention blockade of highways, waterways, and pedestrians will be opened after specific measures have been studied.

　　察北鼠疫并未完全扑灭
    应更加强检疫工作
  　董必武函察省各防疫组织
    【北京讯】中央防疫委员会主任委员董必武十六日致函察哈尔省防疫委员会、张家口市防疫委员会，中央防疫委员会防疫总队，指示：京绥线恢复铁路交通并不是察北鼠疫完全扑灭，因而不应放松防疫工作，相反的在交通恢复后，防疫宣传与检疫工作，更应加强；在察南地区所有原设之各检疫站，在原地执行检疫工作，并应加重业务；察北疫区与张市市郊姬家房子村仍要严密封锁，察北内部可恢复正常的政治经济活动，因公离察北之人员，必须经检疫人员检查给予证明，方可放行。该函除对铁路的客货运作了防疫的具体规定外，并规定：公路、水路、行人之防疫封锁，俟研究具体办法后再行开放。
