Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau Chief Luo Ruiqing
Reprimands Brothel Owners and Madams
Municipal Women's Federation Leader Issues Statement Thanking Authorities for Closing Brothels

[Beijing News] After being gathered at the Municipal Public Security Bureau, the brothel owners and madams of Beijing have now begun to be investigated and processed. Yesterday (23rd), Luo Ruiqing, concurrent Chief of the Bureau, reprimanded the brothel owners and madams detained at the Municipal Bureau to their faces, pointing out their crimes and announcing the policies of the People's Government for handling the matter. Chief Luo reprimanded them, saying, "The brothel system is the most barbaric and cruel man-eating criminal system in the old society that trampled on women. The brothel owners and madams who opened brothels are the direct criminals who oppressed and exploited prostitutes." He pointed out, "The owners and madams are all people who do not engage in honest work but specialize in bad deeds. Some are notorious bullies; some specialize in abducting women from good families and trafficking in human beings; some lend money at usurious rates, making it impossible for prostitutes to pay off their debts in their entire lives, and in reality, they become slaves of the owners and madams; some are even murderers who have killed people. They not only insult the prostitutes' personalities but also do not treat them as human beings, beating them to the point of near-death, forcing them to sell their souls and bodies, and live inhuman lives. Therefore, the property of the owners and madams is accumulated from the pain of countless women." He emphasized, "The people's capital will never allow this barbaric, man-eating system to exist again. The emancipated women and the broad masses of the people not only hate you but also want to liberate these more than a thousand women who have been trampled and humiliated. The Beijing Municipal Government and its subordinate Public Security Bureau, in accordance with the demands of the broad masses of the people, will resolutely ban your crimes, liquidate your sins, and confiscate your property for the purpose of helping the prostitutes." Chief Luo finally said, "From now on, you can only honestly bow your heads to the people and confess your sins to the government, repent sincerely, and start anew, only then will there be a path to self-renewal; otherwise, the people will not be able to tolerate you!" After being reprimanded, the brothel owners and madams, who were aware of their guilt, expressed their willingness to repent, requested leniency, and asked to be allowed to start anew. Chief Luo said, "As long as you sincerely repent, you may receive lenient treatment from the people, but you must be strictly investigated and undergo a period of supervision and training to examine whether your so-called repentance is genuine. Leniency can only be given to those who sincerely and earnestly repent."

[Beijing News] After the Beijing Municipal Democratic Women's Federation Preparatory Committee cooperated with the Municipal People's Government to complete the task of closing the brothels, it is now actively participating in the work of the production and education center. To this end, the person in charge of the Federation issued the following statement yesterday: (1) The sinful brothel system that has existed for thousands of years has been forever eradicated in Beijing. We sincerely thank the wise resolutions of the People's Representative Conference of all circles and the prompt actions of the People's Government. This is an important measure for the liberation of women, which can only be realized in a society where the people themselves have control of the government under the leadership of Chairman Mao. (2) Prostitutes are the most oppressed and devastated victims of the old society. Most of them were either abducted and sold or forced by life to fall into this hell on earth. Now, the People's Government is carrying out the will of all the people of Beijing, rescuing them from the sea of ​​suffering and liberating them. Most of them welcome this. However, due to living a parasitic life for a long time, especially a few so-called upper-class prostitutes who are accustomed to extravagance and dissipation, it is not easy to understand and accept the government's policies for a while. Therefore, educating and transforming prostitutes is a long-term, arduous and complex task. In the past two days, thanks to the efforts of all the staff, we have seen some preliminary results. The emotions of the prostitutes have generally stabilized, and some are eagerly requesting to study. Our Women's Federation Preparatory Committee will continue to assist the government, with tireless and selfless spirit, to overcome difficulties, work hard, dispel their concerns, enlighten their awareness, patiently educate and help them like sisters, and learn from experience in the work, so as to help other cities eliminate this inhuman criminal system faster and enable women across the country to achieve liberation as soon as possible. At the same time, we also hope that people from all walks of life will assist the government in smashing the sabotage of saboteurs, so as to implement the resolutions of the People's Representative Conference of all circles.

　　京市公安局长罗瑞卿
　　训斥妓院老板领家
    市妇联负责人发表谈话感谢封闭妓院措施
    【北京讯】京市各妓院老板、领家自集中于市公安局后，现已开始审查处理。该局罗瑞卿兼局长昨（二十三）日对管押于市局的妓院老板、领家们当面加以训斥，指出他们的罪恶，并宣示人民政府处理的方针。罗局长训斥他们说：“妓院制度，是旧社会中蹂躏妇女最野蛮、最残酷的吃人的罪恶制度，开设妓院的老板、领家，便是直接压迫妓女，剥削妓女的罪人。”他指出：“老板和领家都是不务正业，专作坏事，其中有的是著名的恶霸；有的专门拐骗良家妇女，贩卖人口；有的放高利贷，使妓女们一辈子也还不清，实际就成为老板和领家的奴隶；有的甚至还是杀害过人命的凶犯。对于妓女，不但侮辱她们的人格，且还不把她们当人看待，将她们打得死去活来，逼迫她们出卖灵魂和肉体，过着非人的生活。因此，老板和领家的财产，都是无数妇女的痛苦所积累起来的。”他着重指出：“人民的首都，决不允许这种野蛮的吃人的制度再存在了。翻了身的妇女和广大的人民不但痛恨你们，同时还要解放这一千多个被蹂跃被侮辱的妇女。北京市政府及其所属的公安局遵照广大人民的要求，要坚决取缔你们罪行，要清算你们的罪恶，并且要没收你们的财产作为救济妓女之用。”罗局长最后说：“从今以后，你们只有老老实实的向人民低头悔过，向政府坦白罪行，痛改前非，才有自新之路，否则，人民是不能宽容你们的！”自知有罪的妓院老板领家们在受到训斥后，纷纷表示愿意悔过，要求减轻处罚，准许他们重新作人。罗局长说：“只要你们真心悔改，就可能得到人民的宽大处理，但是必须严格审查你们，并管训你们一个时期，来考察你们的所谓悔改是否真实，宽大的处理，只能给予那些真心诚意痛改前非的人。”
    【北京讯】北京市民主妇联筹委会配合市人民政府完成封闭妓院任务后，现正积极参加生产教养院的工作。该会负责人为此特于昨日发表谈话如下：（一）数千年来罪恶的妓院制度在北京永远绝迹了。我们衷心地感谢各界人民代表会议的英明决议和人民政府的迅速行动。这是解放妇女的一项重要措施，只有在毛主席领导下的人民自己掌握了政权的社会里才能实现。（二）妓女是旧社会最受压迫、最受摧残的牺牲者，她们大部分或被拐骗出卖，或迫于生活才陷入这个人间地狱。现在人民政府执行全北京人民的意志，拯救她们脱离苦海，解放她们，她们大部分是欢迎的。但由于长期过着寄生生活，尤其是少数惯于纸醉金迷的所谓上等妓女，一时不易了解和接受政府的政策。因此，教育和改造妓女是一件长期艰苦而复杂的工作。两天以来，由于全体工作人员的努力，我们已看到一些初步成绩，妓女的情绪已大体安定，一部分还迫切地要求学习。我们妇联筹委会将继续协助政府，以不倦的忘我的精神，克服困难，努力工作，解除她们的顾虑，启发她们的觉悟，耐心地亲如姊妹地教育和帮助她们，从工作中摸索经验，以便帮助其他城市更快的消灭这一非人的罪恶制度，使全国妇女早日获得解放。同时，还希望各界人士协助政府，粉碎破坏分子的捣乱，以便贯彻实行各界代表会议的决议。
