The Black Stone Slope Coal Kiln Chronicles (28)

    Twenty-Five: Return Again

    This time Da San had been away from the village for three years. He hadn't changed much himself, but the village had changed drastically.

    Da San returned from the main road west of the village. He hadn't even entered the village when he heard someone shout from not far south of the main road: "Lao San!" He turned his head to look and saw that on the south slope, a little more than half a li west of the large kiln, there were several cave dwellings in a row. Tianlu was standing in front of one of them, calling him. He quickly climbed up the small path and asked, "Why are you living here? When were these kilns built?" Tianlu pulled him into the small-doored, damp, and dark kiln, saying, "You're back!" Tianlu's wife also came out to greet him, saying, "Rest for a while! Oh! You're back! Quickly warm yourself by the fire, and we can talk slowly." Da San couldn't figure out why they were living here and couldn't help but feel puzzled. Just then, the door of another cave dwelling to the east creaked open, and after a while, Shuancheng came over. Da San asked him, "You live here too?" Shuancheng said, "Of course! Oh, Uncle Da San, you've lost weight! Your face is so yellow and sunken!" Da San looked at Shuancheng and saw that the young man, barely in his twenties, looked almost thirty, with a face and hands covered in black, resembling a coal miner who had been underground for many years. Da San didn't reply, and no one else spoke. At this moment, Tianlu's wife made some boiling water for Da San by the fire, and the only sound in the kiln was the sound of the water boiling in the kettle.

    It was getting dark! Tianlu sighed and, feeling embarrassed, made Da San a meal of cornmeal vegetable pancakes with rice soup, without even a pinch of salt. Shuancheng went back and grabbed a few grains. After Da San finished eating, the kiln was so dark that you couldn't see the person across from you. There were no lights and nowhere to sit. Everyone squeezed onto the bed, and Shuancheng and Tianlu's wife told Da San about the things that had happened in the village over the past few years.

    It turned out that since the village had used Da San's belongings to pay for the expenses of opening the kiln and putting on the opera, and also confiscated Da San's two rooms, and since Gan Danao had asked Tianlu to advance thirty yuan for Da San to repair the temple, where could Tianlu get the money? Therefore, the village had driven Tianlu out of his home and confiscated all his houses and courtyard. Later, he heard that the village had sold the courtyard of him and his brother to the eldest son of Jubao. That fellow was working for the Japanese officer in Taiyuan Prefecture. He came back once, divided the family with Jubao, repaired, renovated, and painted Tianlu and Da San's courtyard, and rented it out to others. Speaking of Shuancheng, he originally lived in Jubao's house. When Jubao was repairing the temple in the village, he also had all his houses whitewashed. The rent used to be four yuan per room per year, but later it rose to one yuan per month, and no arrears were allowed. Shuancheng couldn't afford it and was also driven away. There were twenty or thirty families in the village who were driven away like Shuancheng. Several families, like Tianlu and Shuancheng, had no other way, so they built cave dwellings on this official land at the foot of the southern slope. Even so, they had to pay the village two yuan per year for land rent!

    As Da San listened to these words, he couldn't help but feel resentful. But after he finished listening, he thought: In these years, the outside world has changed so much, how could the village not change! So he didn't say anything, and even forgot about his belongings. But he still asked, "How is Xilu? Who in the village became a traitor to the Japanese? What about Yubao? And Little Foreign Devil and the others?" Shuancheng jumped off the bed, drank a mouthful of cold water, and then got back on the bed to talk. At this time, Tianlu's wife said, "Take your time talking! The three brothers are tired, let's sleep!" As she spoke, she quietly asked Tianlu, "Where will he sleep?" Shuancheng said, "He can sleep at my place! Uncle Da San, my bed is big, and my old mother doesn't take up much space." Tianlu said, "Okay! If Shuancheng wants to talk, let him talk! I'll listen too." Da San didn't say anything, and Shuancheng continued.

    Shuancheng started with the kiln after Da San left, and talked straight through to the temple repair. He said that land was worthless at the time, and Xilu sold eight mu of land. Jubao heard about it and also sold five mu. These lands were also bought by Jubao and his son. Xilu's small shop in Yangquan hadn't been profitable in the past two years. Since Japan implemented rationing last year, the daily necessities of the villagers were distributed by the cooperative. Other items were sold by the Japanese consortium. The shops didn't get much stock, so Xilu closed the shop. Then, after his wife died, he even dismissed his long-term worker, Bian Xiao. The family of six, didn't hire even half a long-term worker, and they had a little less than twenty mu of land, which the whole family farmed. He himself couldn't avoid going to the fields to plow and weed, picking a squash or something. Besides that, he didn't do any business, didn't get involved in village affairs, and rarely left his house. Speaking of traitors to the Japanese, Shuancheng was still unclear about the meaning of the word. He only said that the village chief was still Jubao, and Gan Danao was in charge of the work. Yubao, however, became a village policeman. Speaking of this, Shuancheng remembered something again, and glanced at Da San from the shadows, and quietly said, "I don't know what merits Yubao has, but I heard that Jubao was going to marry Baiquan's daughter to him. Later, people said that Baiquan's daughter was unwilling and tried to commit suicide by hanging herself. On Yubao's side, Niu Bao's sister-in-law also quarreled with him, and that's why it didn't happen. After that, Baiquan's daughter never left the house again. Some time ago, Bian Xiao went back to carry long-term work for Jubao. According to Bian Xiao, Baiquan's family wanted to find someone to marry her off随便寻个人出来, but Jubao didn't allow it. Now she just serves Jubao's wife, and they say she's under house arrest all day long!"

    Shuancheng suddenly stopped talking, and Da San didn't say anything either. The kiln was quiet again, only the fire, sealed with mud cakes, flared up again, the red flames rising a foot high, flickering on people's faces. Tianlu's sleeping child woke up with a "wah" and cried. Da San yawned, and Shuancheng pulled him to sleep.

    黑石坡煤窑演义（２８）
    二十五  再回
    这回大三离村三年，他自己倒没什么变，村里却大变了。
    大三是从村西大道回来的。他还没进村，就听见大道南边不远有人吆喝：“老三！”他转过脸看去，原来在大窑西边半里多地的南坡上，一连有几眼窑洞，天禄正站在一眼窑前叫他。他忙从小道爬上去，问道：“你怎么住这？这是什么工夫打的窑？”天禄一边拉他进那门又小、里边又潮又黑的窑，一边道：“你可回来啦！”天禄老婆也迎出来道：“快歇歇吧！哎呀！可回来啦！快去火边烤烤，有话慢慢说。”大三闹不清他们怎么会住到这来，不免发闷。这时，只听东边另一个窑洞门响了一声，一会，拴成过来了；大三问他道：“你也住这里了？”拴成道：“可不！哟！大三叔，你瘦啦！脸这么黄塌塌地！’大三望望拴成，却见拴成一个才二十挂零的小伙，就老得快象三十，而且满脸满手黑，很象个多年下窑的窑黑。大三没回话，别人也没言声；这时天禄老婆给大三在火上作了开壶，窑里就只听见壶里水滚了的响声。
    天快黑了！天禄叹息着，很不好意思地给大三作了顿糠面菜饼子就米汤吃，连一点咸盐也没有，还是拴成回去抓来了几粒。大三吃罢饭，窑里就黑得对面不见人，也没点灯，也没个坐的，大家挤到炕上，拴成和天禄老婆才告给大三这些年来村里的事。
    原来村里自从把大三的家什顶了开窑唱戏的款，又没收了大三两间房，乾大脑并让天禄给大三垫三十块钱修庙款，天禄可从哪里掏钱啊！因此村里就把天禄赶出了家，连他的房院全没收；后来听说他弟兄俩那个院由村卖给了聚宝的大小子，那家伙又在太原府给日本干事，回来了一趟，跟聚宝分了家，把天禄大三的院修盖粉刷了一下，租给别人住。说到拴成，他原是住的聚宝的房，聚宝在村里修庙的时候，捎带把他所有的房都粉刷了一下，房租过去是一间房一年四块钱，后来涨到一月一块，不许拖欠；拴成掏不起，也被人家赶跑了。村里象拴成一样赶跑的有二三十家，里边象天禄拴成一样没办法的几家，就在这南坡根官地上打了窑洞，就这，每年也得给村里掏两块钱地租哩！
    大三一边听着这些话，一边止不住发恨；但等他听完，他心想：这年月外头变得那么大，村里还能不变！他也就没说什么，连他那些家什也忘了。不过他还问道：“喜禄怎么样了？村里尽谁们当了汉奸，玉宝呢？还有小洋鬼他们呢？”拴成跳下炕喝了口凉水，就又上炕说话。这时天禄老婆道：“有话慢慢说吧！三兄弟也累啦，睡吧！”说着，他又悄悄问天禄：“可宿哪里呀？”拴成说：“宿我那边吧！大三叔，我那炕大，我妈个老人人的，不吃紧。”天禄说：“行！拴成要说就说说吧！我也听听。”大三没说什么，拴成就又说下去。
    拴成从大三走后的窑说起，直说到修庙，说当时地亩不值钱，喜禄卖了八亩地，聚宝听说也卖了五亩，这些地也是聚宝他大小买了。喜禄在阳泉的小铺，这二年也不见利，自从去年日本实行配给，各村老百姓吃用都由合作社配给下来，别的物件又有日本组合卖，小铺们来货也不多，喜禄就把铺面关了，接着他老婆一死，他连长工扁小也退了，一家六口，半块长工也不雇了，还有个小二十亩子地，全家养种着，他自己也短不了上地刨刨闹闹摘个窝瓜什么的，此外就闪商也不干，村里事不沾边，大门也轻易不出。说到汉奸，拴成还闹不清这意思，他只说村长还是聚宝，乾大脑一手办事，玉宝却跟人家当了村警。说到这里，拴成又想起什么来，就从黑影里望了大三一眼，悄悄说：“玉宝也不知有什么功劳，听说聚宝要把白泉家嫁给他，后底人们说是白泉家寻死上吊不乐意，玉宝这边嘛，牛宝他嫂也跟他吵闹，这才没成。往后白泉家再也没出过大门，前些时扁小又给聚宝扛长活去了，听扁小说，白泉家要随便寻个人出来，可聚宝不许，如今她就光侍候聚宝他老婆，说是一天家可受制哩！”
    拴成忽然不说了，大三也没言声，窑里又是静静地，只那炉使泥糕封住了的火又着上来了，红火苗冒起尺来高，照得人们的脸忽晃忽晃地。天禄一个睡着了的孩孩“哇”地一声哭醒了，大三打了个欠，拴成就拉他去睡。
