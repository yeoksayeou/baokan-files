Adjusting Wheat Seeds and Purchasing Autumn Grain
　　Business Development of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives in the Suburbs of Beijing

[Our Newspaper] The Beijing Municipal General Supply and Marketing Cooperative has promoted livestock epidemic prevention injections, adjusted wheat seeds, and purchased autumn grain in the suburbs, achieving great results, and thereby developing the business of rural supply and marketing cooperatives and establishing new cooperatives. The livestock epidemic prevention work began in early August. Seventeen cadres participated, and they were trained at the "Agricultural Science Research Institute" for one month. Afterwards, they were divided into three groups and assigned to work in Nan Yuan, Xi Yuan, and Men Tou Gou. When conducting chicken epidemic prevention injections, they conducted extensive publicity through various meetings, in conjunction with primary school teachers and women's association cadres, to dispel concerns such as "fear of chicken tax," "fear of not laying eggs after injection," and "the meat cannot be eaten." The injections were free of charge, and it was guaranteed that there would be no chicken plague within six months after the injection. As a result, various villages invited the epidemic prevention team to the villages for injections. As of the end of October, 16,474 chickens have been injected. By the beginning of next spring, all villages in the suburbs will be completed. In addition, when swine fever was prevalent, "swine serum" was injected at a low price. Now, in order to save costs, "swine fever vaccine" is being researched. They also plan to establish "Livestock Epidemic Prevention Stations" in various districts, and are negotiating with the government to plan for this.

The work of adjusting wheat seeds and purchasing grain began in September. The method was to combine the suburban work committee and the cooperative bank. In September, 201,786 jin of wheat seeds were loaned. In addition, a portion of wheat seeds was prepared to be supplied to farmers through the following methods: 1. Cash purchases are 3% lower than the market price. 2. Exchange at a price discounted from existing grain. 3. Take the wheat seeds first, and convert them into rice or coarse grains according to the market price on the same day, and return them after the autumn harvest. Currently, 303,179 jin of wheat seeds have been supplied, and some rice has been exchanged. Starting on October 14, a joint meeting of the directors of various branches and offices was convened to arrange the purchase of autumn grain and the supply of daily necessities. The methods are: 1. Purchase with cash at the market. 2. Purchase directly from farmers through village cooperatives or village cooperative preparatory committees. When purchasing, members can be 2% higher than the market price, and non-members can be 1% higher than the market price. In addition, the head office also gives the village cooperatives a 1% handling fee. Various cooperatives began purchasing on the 20th, and within five days they purchased more than one million jin of coarse and fine grains, a portion of which was exchanged for 545 bolts of various colored fabrics, 9 barrels of kerosene, and 22,485 jin of edible salt. Nan Yuan District also purchased more than 50,000 jin of cotton. In addition, 633 waterwheels were loaned, and 1,848 jin of tin ore (soil medicine) was supplied. In conjunction with the Health Bureau, Public Security Bureau, General Trade Union, and Manure Workers' Union, the city's manure was disposed of, and more than 10,000 jin of dried manure from District One was purchased and re-loaned, and ten complete sets of manure carts and manure boxes were loaned.

After the above-mentioned work, the rural supply and marketing cooperatives have been considerably developed. In the four districts of Nan Yuan, West Suburb, Shi Jing Shan, and Men Tou Gou alone, there are already 36 truly supply and marketing cooperatives. The old cooperatives have also enriched their business content and expanded their communities and shares.

　　调剂麦种收购秋粮
  　京郊供销社业务发展
    【本报讯】北京市供销合作总社在郊区推行家畜防疫注射，调剂麦种，收购秋粮，收到很大成绩，并因此发展了农村供销社的业务，建立了新社。家畜防疫工作开始于八月初，参加的干部十七名，曾在“农业科学研究所”受训一个月，后即划成三个小组，分配到南苑、西苑、门头沟工作。在进行家鸡防疫注射时，他们曾通过各种会议，结合小学教员及妇女会干部进行广泛宣传，打破“怕征鸡税”、“怕注射后不下蛋”、“肉不能吃”等疑虑。注射不收任何费用，保证注射后六个月内不闹鸡瘟。这样各村纷纷邀请防疫组到村注射。截至十月底止，已注射家鸡一万六千四百七十四只，明年开春前郊区各村即可全部完成。此外，在猪瘟流行时，曾低价注射“猪血清”一部。现为节省成本，又研究“猪瘟疫苗”。他们还计划成立各区的“家畜防疫站”，正与政府协商筹划中。
    调剂麦种和收购粮食的工作开始于九月，方法是结合郊区工作委员会与合作银行进行。九月份贷放麦种二○一、七八六斤，另外又预备一部麦种，通过下列方式供给农民：一、现款购买低于市价百分之三。二、用现存粮食折价互换。三、先取麦种、各按当日市价折成大米或粗粮，秋收后归还。现已供给麦种三○三、一七九斤，并换回部分大米。十月十四号起，又召开各分社及办事处主任联席会，布置收购秋粮及供给日用必需品的工作。方法是：一、在集市用现款收买。二、通过村社或村社筹委会直接向农民收购。收购时，社员可高于市价百分之二，非社员可高于市价百分之一。另外，总社还给村社百分之一的手续费。各社于二十号开始收购，五天即收购粗细粮共一百余万斤，其中一部分是以各色市布五四五匹，煤油九桶及食盐二二、四八五斤所换回者。南苑区并收购棉花五万余斤。另外，还贷出水车六三三辆，供给信石（地药）一千八百四十八斤。并结合卫生局、公安局、总工会、粪业工会等处理城内存粪，收买并转贷内一区粪干一万余斤，贷出粪车粪箱十整套。
    经过上述工作，农村供销社得到相当发展，仅南苑、西郊、石景山、门头沟四个区，已有了三十六个名符其实的供销社，旧有的社也都充实了业务内容，扩大了社区与股金。
