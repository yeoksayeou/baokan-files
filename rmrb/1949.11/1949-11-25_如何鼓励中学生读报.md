　　How to Encourage Middle School Students to Read Newspapers
　　Hu Guanglin
    Since the start of the semester, students at Beijing Municipal Fifth Middle School have made significant progress in their lives, studies, and ideological conduct compared to the previous semester. However, the number of students reading newspapers remains small. Usually, only a few active students roughly scan important news, and most students are not concerned enough about current affairs. To address this shortcoming, the school authorities, in the "Striving for Red Banner" learning competition, planned and launched a current affairs quiz competition to cultivate students' newspaper reading habits.

    During a meeting of grade-level teachers, the issue of students reading newspapers was discussed. It was generally believed that to strengthen students' love for the motherland, their support for construction efforts, and their clear understanding of current issues, it was necessary to encourage students to read newspapers. Specific measures to encourage students to read newspapers included grade-level teachers frequently discussing current affairs with students, the school subscribing to more newspapers, and highlighting important news and documents in red ink and posting them to attract students' attention, making it easier for them to read with a focus. In addition, it was decided to encourage students in each class to subscribe to newspapers, at least one per class. Later, the grade-level teachers brought these ideas to the class for discussion, and most students agreed with these measures. A few students who were not interested in newspapers or worried about the cost were persuaded by the grade-level teachers and the majority of students, so each class subscribed to newspapers.

    Although there were newspapers, and more people were reading them, some students were still not interested in newspapers. Therefore, the school authorities used the morning exercise time to select students from each class (one or two from each class) to participate in current affairs quizzes, and announced the quiz scores and incorrect answers on the tests (such as answering that the Premier of the State Council was Liu Tiecheng, or that Vyshinsky was the leader of the American Communist Party) to remind students to pay attention. It was also announced that a school-wide current affairs quiz would be held in two weeks.

    Fifth Middle School has both senior and junior high school students, with varying levels of political understanding and differing degrees of concern for current affairs. It was difficult to have a set of quiz questions suitable for the level of all students. To ensure that the quiz questions were suitable for the students' level, it was decided that the questions should come from the masses. Let the students first raise questions while reading the newspapers, which would be compiled by the class chairman and submitted to the Academic Affairs Office. The period for submitting questions was one week, to see which class, which group, or which student found the most questions. Then, based on the questions submitted by the students, they would be comprehensively organized, announced to the students for reading, and then a portion of the announced questions would be selected as quiz questions. The students were mobilized to find questions. When the scheduled time for submitting questions arrived, some classes had not yet submitted their questions, so big-character posters were put up to encourage the students, and the results of each class submitting questions were announced using cartoons. On the one hand, it was announced to the students that each class could continue to collect questions and extend the deadline for submission.

    In this way, the students in each class were mobilized. After class, during free periods, and after meals, groups of students crowded in the hallways, holding notebooks and pencils, reading and writing down questions. In the class, groups challenged groups, individuals challenged individuals, and they discussed and studied with each other, launching a high tide of newspaper reading.

    The total number of questions collected by each class was over 15,000 (of which Class C of Junior Grade Two found 5,284 questions, Class B of Junior Grade Two found 4,732 questions, the first group of Class C of Junior Grade Two found 1,199 questions, and a very young student named Shen Mengpei found 275 questions, showing amazing results.)

    In the process of asking questions, there were biases. For example, some students, in order to ask more questions and strive for first place, read newspapers until late at night and refused to sleep. Some students, in order to make up the numbers, took a question and rephrased it in many ways with repeated meanings, such as repeating the question "Where did the plague occur?" into "Is there a plague in Tangshan?" "Is there a plague in Tianjin?" "Is there a plague in Guangzhou?"...

    The more than 15,000 questions submitted by the students were organized and summarized into 150 questions. These were copied onto big-character posters and given to the students for review. Then, 22 questions were selected to conduct a current affairs political quiz for all students in the school. The Academic Affairs Office convened nearly 100 class chairmen and committee members to grade the papers and determine the scores. The method of evaluation was mutual evaluation to avoid favoritism. After the evaluation, the executive committee of the student union checked by class. After the evaluation was completed, the best and worst answers were found and announced together.

    The evaluation results showed that the school's overall average score was about 70 points, six classes scored above 80 points, the first group of Senior Grade Two scored above 90 points, and four students scored 100 points. Based on these results, this quiz was basically successful.

    The incorrect answers also reflected that the political current affairs level of some students was very low. For example, to the question "What are Bolsheviks?", some answered "They are Indians," "The capital of the Mongolian People's Republic," "Germans," etc. Some wrote the principle of democratic centralism as "The central government obeys the people," "Both public and private interests are taken into account, and labor and management benefit each other," "The lower level obeys the upper level." Some wrote the leader of the Korean People's Republic as "Shi Zhiren," the author of The Young Guard as "Molotov," and the "December 9th" Movement as the "July 7th" Movement.

    Through this preparation and quiz, the students' habit and interest in reading newspapers have been initially cultivated. For example, each class subscribes to a newspaper, and many students take current affairs notes or often use current affairs issues as content for writing diaries. The school authorities will continue to hold current affairs quizzes regularly to continuously and gradually improve students' enthusiasm for reading newspapers.

　　如何鼓励中学生读报
　　胡光霖
    开学以来北京市立第五中学同学无论在生活、学习、思想作风方面比起上学期来都有了显著的进步。但是读报的人仍然很少，经常只是一部分积极的学生粗枝大叶的看看重要的消息，一般同学对时事都不够关心。针对这个缺点，学校当局在“争红旗”学习竞赛运动中，有计划地发动了时事测验竞赛，借以培养同学们的读报习惯。
    在级任会议上讨论到学生读报问题，大家认为要加强学生对祖国的热爱、对建设事业的拥护、对现实问题有清楚的认识，必须鼓励学生读报。鼓励同学读报的具体办法是级任经常对学生讲些时事问题，学校多订几份报纸，并把重要的新闻和文件用红笔钩出张贴出来，引起学生的注意，便于学生有重点的阅读。此外还决定发动各班学生订报，至少每班一份。以后级任便将这些意见带到班上讨论，多数同学都赞成这些办法；个别对报纸不感兴趣和怕化钱的同学，也被级任和多数同学说服，于是各班都纷纷订报了。
    报纸虽然有了，读报的人也比较增加了，但还有少数学生对报纸照旧不感兴趣。因此，学校当局便利用早操时间抽调各班同学（每班一人或二人）参加时事测验，并将测验成绩和试卷中错误的答案（比如政务院总理答为刘铁城，维辛斯基是美共领袖）等公布出来，以提醒同学们的注意，并宣布，将在两周内举行一次全校同学参加的时事测验。
    五中有高中也有初中，政治水平参差不齐，对时事关心的程度也不一致，很难有一套适合全体学生程度的测验题目。为了能使测验题目适合于同学的水平，便决定出题要从群众中来，让同学在读报中先提出问题来，由班主席汇集交到教导处，时期为一星期，看那一班、那一组、那一个同学找到的问题最多，然后根据同学们交来的问题，综合整理，公布出去给同学们阅读，再由公布的问题中选择一部分作为测验的问题。并发动同学找问题。到了预定交题时间，有些班级还没有把问题交来，便出大字报给同学打气，并利用漫画将交题各班的成绩公布。一方面又向同学们宣布：各班可以继续收集问题，展期交付。
    这样各班同学都发动起来了，课后、空堂、饭后、都有成群的同学挤在走道上，手中拿着本子、铅笔，一面阅读，一面将问题记下来。在班上：小组与小组，个人与个人也互相挑战，并且互相讨论、研究，展开了读报的高潮。
    各班搜集的问题总数在一万五千题以上（其中初二丙一班找到五二八四题，初二乙一班找到四七三二题，初二丙的第一小组找到一一九九题，一个很小的同学沈梦培找到二七五题，表现了惊人的成绩。）
    在出题的过程中偏向是存在的，比如有些同学为了提出更多的问题，争取第一，读报读到深夜还不肯睡觉。有些同学为了凑数，抓到一个问题便换汤不换药地编造许多意义重复的问题，如把“鼠疫发生在什么地方”一题，重复成“唐山有没有鼠疫？”“天津有没有鼠疫？”“广州有没有鼠疫？”………。
    把同学提出的一万五千多问题经过整理，归纳成一五○题。便用大字报抄布，给同学复习之后，再选出二十二个题目，举行了本校全体同学的时事政治测验。并由教导处召集了各班班会主席、委员将近一百人整理试卷，评定分数。评定的办法是互相评定，避免循私。评定之后再由学生会执委按班检查。评定完毕，然后再找出最好的，和最错误的答案一齐公布。
    评定结果全校总平均分约七十分，六个班级在八十分以上，高二乙第一小组在九十分以上，一百分的有四个同学，由这些成绩看来，这次测验基本上是成功的。
    在错误的答案当中，也反映出来部分同学政治时事水平很低，如“布尔塞维克是什么？”一题，有答成“是印度人”、“外蒙古人民共和国首都”、“德国人”等的。有把民主集中制的原则，写成“中央服从人民”、“公私兼顾，劳资两利”、“上级服从下级的。”有把朝鲜人民共和国领袖写成“石志仁”，青年近卫军的作者写成“莫洛托夫”，“一二、九”运动写成“七、七”运动的。
    通过这次酝酿和测验，同学们读报的习惯和兴趣，已经初步培养起来了。如每班都订有一份报纸，不少同学还作时事笔记，或把时事问题常作为写日记的内容。学校当局以后还要经常举行时事测验，不断的逐步的提高同学们读报情绪。
