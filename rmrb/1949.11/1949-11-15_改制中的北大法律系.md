The Peking University Law Department brewed further reforms during the summer vacation. Last semester, thanks to the efforts of all its teachers and students, a preliminary and urgently needed reform was carried out, suspending many law subjects and adding five new courses. This pioneered a widespread curriculum reform among the liberal arts and law colleges of various universities and achieved certain results. Although these reforms were necessary at the time, they were not based on very detailed and systematic research. From the beginning, it was intended that after a half-year trial period, more improvements would be made based on the advantages and disadvantages discovered. For six months, they had been carefully exploring, so when the Higher Education Commission invited experts to form a curriculum reform research group to start work, the Peking University Law Department was able to offer more mature opinions and provide meaningful experience for the research group's reference. During this period, professors, lecturers, assistants, and students of the department summarized the work of the temporary curriculum reform of the last semester, believing that it had achieved results. Under the situation of just liberation, such reform played a certain role, but when the learning environment became more stable and the curriculum was required to be more standardized, the reform of the last semester seemed insufficient. Everyone felt that last semester: 1. overemphasized collective learning, immediately organizing three or four discussion groups without focusing on mastering one or two subjects to absorb experience. As a result, there was not enough preparation before the discussions, and the leadership seemed relaxed because it could not take care of everything, making it difficult to do well in any one subject, and making it easy for everyone to lose confidence in collective learning; 2. abolished most professional courses, which was necessary at the time, but in the long run, courses that should be reformed and those that should be abolished should be treated differently. On the other hand, political courses should occupy a major position, but should not be equivalent to including all courses; 3. in the new course learning, there was no leadership to link everyone to reality, so some extreme individualism, dogmatism, or scholastic learning appeared.

Due to these recognitions, everyone analyzed the basic situation facing today's legal education: reactionary laws have been abolished, and the people's own legal system is being drafted and created. There are not many current laws and regulations, and new teaching materials and teachers are lacking; secondly, students generally lack basic knowledge of Marxism-Leninism, especially the Marxist-Leninist view of the state, law, and society, which must be clearly established as the basis for all professional learning; on the other hand, the old ideological consciousness brought by teachers and students from the old society should be continuously transformed in learning in order to cultivate truly people's legal cadres; moreover, the old teaching methods have proven unable to adapt to today's learning; everyone also estimated that due to the rapid development of the revolutionary situation, there is an urgent need for legal cadres everywhere, so students must prepare with sufficient basic knowledge and the thought of serving the people in learning, so that they can competently take up their posts at any time.

Based on these conditions and such understanding, the Peking University Law Department followed the "Provisional Regulations on the Curriculum of Various Departments of Liberal Arts and Law Colleges of the Higher Education Committee," which was still in the final stages of discussion and revision at the time. After extensively soliciting students' opinions and detailed discussions at two department meetings, it formally arranged the learning for this academic year.

According to the principles of these regulations, combined with the specific situation of Peking University, they stipulated:

1.  The whole department must take dialectical materialism and historical materialism as compulsory political courses, and pointed out that the purpose is to transform thinking, destroy old thinking, cultivate the basic viewpoints of Marxism-Leninism, and gradually establish a communist outlook on life through the study of this subject. 2. Policies and regulations are compulsory for all grades, and all professors participate in guiding this course. Learning law in the old way, isolating the law and using the method from concept to concept, is to be abandoned. Correctly grasping the spirit of the party's policies and regulations is the most basic requirement for new legislative and judicial cadres. To learn law well and do legal work well, one must first seriously study policies and regulations. This course also tries to adopt new teaching methods. 3. Add Marxist-Leninist legal theory, selected readings of Marxist-Leninist classics, and political economy as compulsory or elective courses for each grade. The former two were later taught by Professor He Sijing, and discussions were appropriately organized, but regular discussions were not stipulated to avoid too many discussion groups. 4. Reduce the time for professional courses, and try to lecture based on new judicial experience and legislative materials. The subjects are opened as compulsory or elective courses for each grade according to the students' level in each grade according to the regulations of the Higher Education Committee, and it is particularly emphasized that they should be studied critically. 5. Universally call on students to learn Russian in order to prepare to accept and study the advanced legal theories of the socialist motherland, the Soviet Union.

After such a curriculum was announced, students had many ideological problems and many questions. For example, some people thought that the political courses were too heavy, or asked what legal studies could be found in policies and regulations? Some students completely distrusted collective learning, thinking it was a waste of time and useless; some said that Peking University was a regular university and could not use the teaching methods of China University or Revolutionary University. Positive students thought that hiring many new professors and opening many new courses would be the most straightforward and ideal, but they did not know that the experience of new legal education still had to be explored and created by everyone burying their heads and working hard. Most of the students did not initially believe in the principle of mutual assistance between teachers and students and teaching each other. Some students one-sidedly believed that to establish something new, one must delve into the profound and first do a good job of the old. Some people also disagreed with the idea of critical acceptance and research. The views on political courses were also very divergent. Some people were self-proclaimed thorough Marxists, thinking that their thinking did not need to be transformed, or thought that they had already studied the history of social development and new philosophy last semester, and could just not study it; others thought that if they did not do this, they would have to read large volumes of Marx, Lenin, philosophical books, sociology, etc., and were unwilling to admit or did not understand the purpose and importance of this course of transforming thinking.

The department first held a get-together, where the administrative负责人 reported the curriculum plan, first brewing it in the students' minds, and encouraged everyone to clarify the significance of selecting and studying political courses. At the same time, students who participated in the party training class during the summer vacation, participated in workers' education in factories, and participated in court trial practice, respectively reported on learning methods and experiences, explaining the importance of grasping policies in actual work. Subsequently, a discussion on new democracy learning was launched among the students. According to the department's curriculum and the department's specific learning plan, the小组 conducted reviews and made active suggestions and plans in conjunction with the courses, contents, and teaching methods offered by the department; at the welcoming conference, they started with many practical problems in learning, life, and administration in a casual way, and finally summarized and resolved several problems that were not clear enough and still had doubts in the students' minds. In this way, relying on the joint efforts of the administration, professors, assistants, and all students, everyone further understood the spirit of this curriculum regulation, and what must be done to implement this spirit? How must it be done? Everyone knew that it was not enough to evaluate this regulation simply from the names of the courses. It should be: 1. Guarantee that the study of political courses can truly connect with the reality of thinking, expose thinking, transform one's own thinking, and study political courses well is the most important. 2. There must be a combination of teachers and students in order to have mutual assistance between teachers and students and teach each other. By adhering to this principle, it is easy to solve the difficulties of teachers and materials that stand in front of the old universities, and to change the previous rigid cramming teaching method. 3. In professional courses, learn to use the Marxist-Leninist position, viewpoint, and method to conduct struggles against feudal, comprador, and fascist ideas and theories, and critically accept the professional courses that are being transformed. 4. Spend more time learning policies and regulations, and use this as a starting point to adopt new teaching methods. Only by learning policies and regulations well can one learn other professional courses well. 5. We must understand and adopt the method of "self-study as the main, collective as the auxiliary, and teachers assisting from the side," opposing both closed-door complete individual learning and formalistic collective learning without preparation and without a basis for self-study. At the same time, we must remove the idea of relying on teachers and relying on reports.

Quickly, the students'小组 were established. This year, students in the same department level are concentrated together, making it very convenient to hold discussion meetings, check learning, and help each other; the小组 is divided according to the dormitory, and the life小组 and the learning小组 are combined to unify the leadership, correcting the mistake of mechanically separating life and learning. Life is to ensure learning, and only by living happily, stably, and regularly can one learn better and more effectively. In order to combine teachers and students and learn together, all professors, assistants, and graduate students in the department each participated in a小组. Initially, many people did not agree with this approach: some professors were deeply afraid that there would not be enough time to hinder their own learning; some professors felt that it was inconvenient to go to the students' dormitories; others thought that it would not be easy to hold good discussion meetings in this way. However, after two weeks of experimentation, everyone's views changed. The head of the department said that the students raised many questions that he had not even thought of; a professor said that he did not agree with this approach very much at first, but after participating in the小组, he felt that spending time participating in the students'小组 was not a pity, but helped his own progress a lot, and he also became younger, and corrected many of his arrogant ideas; another小组 immediately had professors answer many specialized questions encountered in learning, and felt very satisfied. Individual professors took the initiative to find the小组 students to talk outside of class and discuss problems. Originally, in addition to teaching, Peking University's law professors also assisted the government in some legislative work, and the time was tight, but participating in the小组 was still extremely enthusiastic, which also greatly encouraged the students. One student said that we should not fail to prepare well! This new way of combining teachers and students should be a very good direction in the old-style universities. Preliminary experiments at Peking University Law Department have proved that it can be adopted.

In addition to the participation of all professors, students also participated in leading the learning of the policies and regulations course. This is a new course. There are neither ready-made teaching materials, nor ready-made teachers, nor very complete experience for reference. The department first established a working committee including professors, assistants, graduate students, and students to collect materials, clippings, make indexes, and formulate learning progress, topics, and key points. What is prepared to be learned this semester is: 1. Urban policy: including the relationship between urban and rural areas, the organizational form of urban power, the restoration and development of industry and commerce, etc.; 2. Rural policy: including land reform, rent reduction and interest reduction, democratic construction of power, and the handling of suburban land, etc.; 3. Financial and economic policy: including finance, trade, foreign exchange, finance, etc.; 4. Labor policy: including labor-capital relations, labor legislation, trade union work, labor insurance, etc. New judicial system, marriage law, etc. will be learned next semester. The method is to first assign the main materials to students for reading, then the professor in charge of the topic will make an enlightening report, prepare an outline for小组 discussion, summarize and answer questions from the conference report, and after each stage of learning is completed, invite the person in charge with practical work experience to come to the school to summarize and answer the questions that have not yet been answered. In this kind of learning, fully use new teaching methods to realize the principle of "mutual assistance between teachers and students and teaching each other." Currently, more than two weeks have been spent studying the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Professors Zhang Zhirang, He Sijing, Xu Deheng, Qian Duansheng, Fan Hong, Yuan Hanqing, Wang Tieya, and Lou Bangyan were invited to report on each chapter of the Common Program. Each report was crowded with people in the auditorium, and the小组 discussions were enthusiastic. It is very meaningful to take the CPPCC documents as a regular course. Old universities are improving step by step, and everyone should work harder.

After listening to Comrade Ai Siqi's report on learning objectives and methods, the problems of self-study, the problem of linking theory and practice, and the problem of whether to have a correct stand first to learn Marxism-Leninism or to learn Marxism-Leninism to establish a correct stand, were raised and involved in discussions and debates in the小组 and large classes. Individual小组 mutually guaranteed to study political courses well and gradually understood the necessity of ideological transformation. The head of the department himself served as a political course teacher. In the first class, he said that I was also here to study, and my thinking must also be transformed. To do this course well, we must rely on everyone's joint efforts; some小组 have already launched criticism and self-criticism.

Some students raised opinions on inappropriate lectures and imperfect teaching methods through小组, and professors also voluntarily sought students' opinions on the courses they taught. This situation did not exist before liberation, and there were few such things before the reform. Today, everyone is responsible for learning, and only through continuous improvement can regular universities truly shoulder the responsibility of new democratic cultural education. In learning, students provide many positive suggestions. Everyone knows that to run education well, teach well, and learn well, there must be a grand chorus of administration, teachers, and students.

At a recent department meeting, the previous tedious bureaucratic style was initially changed. Most of the meeting time was spent discussing learning issues, listening to reflections on students' learning, and studying solutions to problems that could be solved immediately. It also examined the implementation of regulations and teaching methods, and the students' tendency to not carefully self-study, but only rely on collective learning; the issue of professors participating in小组 was discussed for a long time, and it was decided to strengthen the leadership of large classes and absorb students and department learning cadres to participate in learning leadership institutions, etc. Although this is only a new beginning, in the department meetings of the old universities, carefully studying the students' learning situation and discussing how to better lead learning, rather than just making some administrative disputes, this transformation is worth noting in the entire process of education reform.

After the reform, the enthusiasm of the law department students for learning has been unprecedentedly high. Except for sick leave, there are few absences from小组 meetings. At night, they are either in class or in discussion meetings, or they are studying on their own. Mr. Zhang Zhirang's Principles of Constitution asked for leave due to an event, and the students requested to make up for the class on Sunday. The students also requested a large supply of more reference books and learning materials. The发言 in the discussion meetings are generally enthusiastic. Those who are not well prepared are criticized. There are automatic roll calls, the establishment of mutual assistance小组 to supervise and assist learning, and the mutual订 learning plans. Everyone is confident in working hard to train themselves into a useful people's legal cadre who can suppress the reactionary class, safeguard the interests of the working people, and consolidate the people's democratic state apparatus.

From this period of reform, it can be seen that in implementing the curriculum regulations of the Higher Education Committee, it is required that all colleges and departments truly grasp the spirit of these regulations and take other appropriate and necessary steps to ensure the realization of the true purpose of these regulations; the party's policy is completely correct. Every person in a cultural and educational work position should patiently and conscientiously implement the policy of "resolutely transforming and gradually realizing," and transform the old education and the old school system in a step-by-step and planned manner. Even a small gain, accumulated and promoted, may eventually break through and capture the old cultural fortress. Secondly, we should see that a clear understanding of the spirit of the policy by the administration is a very important factor for the reform work. Students should strive for the administration to carry out beneficial reforms, and the administration must often study and solve the problems of the students. In the reform, party members and members of the Communist Youth League should play a positive leading role, help and mobilize students to solve problems in learning, and ensure the implementation of policies. At the same time, before implementing the reform, we must deeply understand the situation, conduct necessary investigation and research, and implement the regulations of the higher authorities in conjunction with the specific situation of our own colleges and departments. Another experience and lesson that should be summarized is: we must mobilize the masses' thinking, understand why we should change in this way, and what are the benefits of changing; and always listen to the opinions and difficulties of the masses. Without adhering to the mass line, we can only wait for failure.

Quickly reforming the old education in accordance with the spirit of the provisional curriculum regulations of the Higher Education Committee is an urgent task for all universities. Oppose only being satisfied with the superficial conformity of curriculum names. We must constantly improve teaching methods and teaching content, accept the experiences and lessons of other schools, abandon the bad ones, and promote and consolidate existing achievements, transform the old education as soon as possible, and prepare to welcome the upsurge of cultural construction in the people's motherland!

    改制中的北大法律系
    余叔通
    暑期中，北大法律系便酝酿着进一步的改制。上学期，由于他们全体师生的努力，曾经作了一次初步的急需的改革，停开了很多法律科目，增加五门新课程；因此率先推动了各大学文法学院中广泛的课程改革，收获了一定效果。这些改革在当时虽然是必要的，但却还是没有很详细的系统的研究，同时也自始便准备在半年试验后根据发现的优缺点来作更完善的改革。六个月来，他们便一直在细心摸索着，因此，当高等教育委员会邀请专家组成课程改革研究小组开始工作时，北大法律系便有可能提出较成熟意见，和提供有意义的经验供研究小组参考了。在这一段期间，系里教授、讲助、同学总结了上学期临时课程改革的工作，认为是有成绩的，在刚解放的形势下，这样的改革起了它一定的作用，但当学习环境比较安定了，要求课程的比较正规化时，上学期的改革便显得不够了。大家都觉得上学期：一、过份强调了集体学习，一下子组织了三四个讨论班没有重点地去掌握一两门功课，吸取经验，这样，讨论之先没有充足的准备，而领导上因为照顾不来而显得松弛，结果任何一门也不易搞好，使大家对集体学习容易失去信心；二、废止了大部份业务课，在当时是需要的，但从长期来看，还应该分别课程之应改造和应废止的加以不同处理，另一方面，政治课程应该占主要地位，但不应等于包括全部课程；三、在新课程学习中没有领导大家连系实际，因此部份出现了极端个人主义的、教条主义的或经院式的学习。
    由于这些认识，大家又分析了今天法律教育问题所面对的基本情况是：反动的法律已经废止，人民自己的法律体系又正在草拟创建中，现行法令不多，新的教材和师资是缺乏的；其次，同学们一般地马列主义的基本知识还很不够，特别是马列主义的国家观法律观社会观，必需作为一切业务学习的基础明确地建立起来；另一方面师生的从旧社会带来的旧思想意识，应该在学习中不断地改造，才有可能培养出真正的人民法律干部；而且旧的教学方法已经证明不能适应今天的学习了；大家又估计到现在由于革命形势的急遽开展，各地需要法律干部很迫切，因此同学必须在学习中准备有足够的基本知识和为人民服务的思想，以便能随时胜任地走上工作岗位。
    根据这些条件和这样的了解，北大法律系遵照了当时还在作最后讨论修改中的“高等教育委会文法学院各系课程暂行规定”，经过广泛征求同学意见和两次系务会议的详细讨论后，正式布置本年度的学习。
    依照这个规定的原则，结合北大的具体情况，他们规定了：
    一、全系必修政治课辩证法唯物论和历史唯物论，并指出目的在于通过这科目的学习来改造思想，破坏旧的思想，培养马列主义的几个基本观点，逐步地建立共产主义人生观。二、政策与法令为各年级必修，教授全体参加指导这门功课。旧的学习法律是把法律孤立起来，用的从概念到概念的方法，是要摒弃的。正确掌握党的政策法令的精神是对新的立法司法干部的最基本要求，要学好法律，做好法律工作，就必先认真的学习政策法令，这一门课并试行采用新的教学方法。三、增开马列主义法律理论，马列主义名著选读和政治经济学分别为各级的必修或选修科目，前两门后来请何思敬教授来校讲授，并适当地组织讨论，但不规定作定期讨论，以免讨论班太多了。四、业务课时间加以压缩，尽量依据新的司法经验和立法材料来讲授，科目是依照高等教育委会规定就各年级学生程度开设为各年级必修或选修科，并特别着重指出要批判地学习。五、普遍地号召同学选习俄文，以为接受并研究社会主义祖国苏联的先进法学理论的准备。
    这样的课程公布后，同学们曾存在着不少思想问题，疑问很多。例如有人以为政治课太重了，或者问政策法，令中能找到什么法律学？有些同学完全不信任集体学习，认为浪费时间，于事无补；有的说北大是正规大学，不能用华大革大那一套教学方法。积极的同学觉得能够聘很多新教授，开很多新课最干脆，最理想，却不知道新的法律教育的经验还得大家埋头认真地摸索创造。大部分的同学在最初不大相信师生互助、教学相长的原则。有一些同学片面地认为要建立新的，必须钻研高深，先搞好旧的。也有人不同意批判地接受与研究的提法。对政治课的看法也分歧得很，有人是自封彻底马克斯主义者，认为自己思想已经不必改造了，或者以为上学期已经念过社会发展史和新哲学，尽可不学了；另外一些人则以为不这样，就得念些大部头大部头的马列、哲学书籍、社会学等，不肯承认或不了解这改造思想课程的目的和重要性。
    系会首先开了联欢会，由行政负责人报告了课程计划，先在同学思想上作酝酿，并鼓励大家明确选习政治课的意义。同时，暑期参加党训班学习时的、参加工厂工人教育工作的、参加法院审判实习的同学，分别报告了学习方法和心得，说明了掌握政策在实际工作中的重要性。并随后在同学中展开关于新民主主义学习的讨论，根据系方课程及系会的学习具体计划在小组中结合本系所开课目，内容，教学方法来进行检讨便作积极建议及计划；在迎新大会上，用漫谈方式从很多学习上、生活上、行政上的实际问题谈起，最后归结拢来解决几个在同学思想中还不够明确，还有怀疑的问题。这样，依靠了行政上、教授、讲助、全体同学的共同努力，大家都进一步了解这个课程规定的精神，要贯彻这精神，必须做些什么？必须怎样做？大家都知道单纯从课程名目上来估量这个规定是不够的。应该１、保证政治课学习能真真地联系思想实际，暴露思想，改造自己的思想，学好政治课是最主要的。２、必须师生结合，才有可能师生互助，教学相长，坚持了这样的原则，便容易解决横梗在旧大学眼前的师资教材的困难，和一改从前刻板的填鸭的教学方式。３、要在业务课中，学习运用马列主义的立场观点方法，对封建买办法西斯的思想、理论进行斗争，批判地接受正在改造中的业务课。４、政策法令要多花时间去学，并以此为起点采用新的教学方法，学好政策法令，才能学好其他业务课。５、要好好理解并采用“自学为主，集体为辅，教员从旁协助”的方式，既反对关门的完全个人学习，也反对没有准备的没有自学基础的形式主义的集体学习，同时要去除依靠教员依赖报告的想法。
    很快地，同学的小组建立起来了，今年同系级的同学都集中住在一起，开讨论会、检查学习、互助都有很大方便；小组是依照寝室划分，并把生活小组和学习小组结合起来，使领导统一，纠正了把生活和学习机械地分割开的错误，生活是为了保证学习，也唯有生活得愉快安定和有规律才能学习得更好更有效率。为了使师生结合，一道学习，全系教授、讲助、研究生每人都分别参加一个小组，最初好些人不赞同这样作法：有些教授深恐时间不够，妨碍自己学习；有些教授觉得到学生宿舍去不方便；也有人认为这样一定不容易开好讨论会。可是，经过两周试验后，大家看法都改变了。系主任说同学们提出很多的问题原来是自己连想也没有想到的；一位教授说原来不很同意这样作，但参加小组后觉得时间用来参加同学的小组不但不可惜，而且对自己进步帮助很大，自己也年青起来，而且纠正了自己很多自高自大的想法；另一个小组因为学习中接触到很多专门问题，立刻有教授给解答了，觉得蛮满意，个别的教授主动地找小组同学在课外谈话，讨论问题。本来，北大法律系教授在教学之外，还都多少协助政府做一部份立法工作，时间忙迫，但参加小组还是异常热烈，这一点对于同学也鼓励很大，有一个同学说不应该不好好准备呵！这种新的师生结合的方式在旧制大学中应该是一个很好的方向，在北大法律系的初步试验，证明是可以采用的。
    政策法令课除了全部教授参加外，同学也参加了领导学习，这是一门新的课程，既没有现成教材，也没有现成师资，更没有很完整的经验可供参考。系里便先成立包括教授、讲助、研究生、同学的工作委员会、进行搜集资料，剪报，制索引，拟订学习进度、题目、重点等。这一个学期准备学习的是：１城市政策：包括城乡关系、城市政权组织形式、工商业恢复与发展等问题；２、乡村政策：包括土地改革、减租减息、民主建政、城郊土地处理等问题；３、财经政策：包括金融、贸易、外汇、财政等问题；４、劳工政策：包括劳资关系、劳工立法、工会工作、劳动保险等问题。下学期才学习新司法制度、婚姻法令等。方法是首先指定主要资料发给同学阅读，然后由负责该题目的教授作启发报告，拟发大纲小组讨论，根据会报中的问题归纳作解答，每一阶段学习完毕后，请有实际工作经验的负责人员来校作总结并解答还没有解答的问题，在这样的学习中来充分运用新的教学方法，实现“师生互助、教学相长”的原则。目前已经先进行了两个多星期关于人民政协共同纲领的学习，邀请了张志让、何思敬、许德珩、钱端升、樊弘、袁翰青、王铁崖、楼邦彦等教授分别作共同纲领各章报告，每一次报告礼堂都挤满了人，小组讨论热烈，把政协文件作为正课学习，这是很有意义的事，旧大学是在一步一步地改进中，大家应该更努一把力。
    政治课在听完艾思奇同志关于学习目的与方法的报告后，小组及大班的讨论上关于自学的问题，关于理论与实际连系的问题，关于先要有正确立场来学马列主义还是学习马列主义来建立正确立场问题，都被提出来并卷入讨论和争辩中。个别小组互相保证一定要学好政治课，渐渐明白思想改造的必要。系主任自己担任政治课教员，第一堂他便说我也是来学习的，我的思想也要改造，这门课要搞好要依靠大家共同努力；有些小组已经开展批评与自我批评。
    有些同学对讲授得不适当的地方和教学法不完善的，都通过小组提出意见，教授们也有自动征求同学对他所授课程的意见，这种情形在解放前是没有的，就是在改制前也很少这样的事情，今天，大家对学习负责了，只有在不断的改进，才能够使正规大学真真担起新民主主义文化教育的责任。在学习中，同学提供很多积极的建议，谁都知道要把教育办好，教得好，学得好，必须行政、师生来个大合唱。
    最近的一次系务会议上，初步地改变了以往的繁琐事务主义作风，会议的大部分时间是讨论学习问题，听取了同学学习情况的反映，并且就可以立刻解决的问题研究解决办法，检查关于贯彻规定和教学方法的情形，和同学不细心自学，只依靠集体学习的偏向；对于教授参加小组作了很久讨论，议决加强大课领导，吸收同学系会学习干事参加学习领导机构等，这虽然只是一个新的开始，在旧大学里系务会议上，好好地进行研究同学学习情形，并讨论如何更好地领导学习，而不是只作一些行政事务的争论，这转变在整个教育的改造过程中，是值得重视的。
    经过了改制，法律系的同学学习情绪空前地高涨，小组会除了病假外很少缺席的，晚上不是上课便是讨论会，要不便是自修；张志让先生的宪法原理因事请假，同学要求在礼拜天也给补课，同学们又要求大量地供给更多参考书籍和学习资料，讨论会中发言普遍地是热烈的，准备不足的受到了批评，有自动点名的，有成立互助小组监督并互助学习的，有互订学习计划的，大家都有信心地要努力训练自己为一个有用的镇压反动阶级，维护劳动人民利益，巩固人民民主国家机器的人民法律干部。
    从这一段改革中，可以看到在执行高等教育委员会的课程规定时，就要求各院系要真真地掌握这规定的精神，采取其他适当的必要的步骤来保证这一规定的真正目的的实现；党的政策是完全正确的，每一个在文化教育工作岗位的人员，都应该耐心地认真地贯彻“坚决改造、逐步实现”的方针，有步骤有计划地来改造旧教育旧学制，那怕是一点小小的收获，积累起来，推广开去，便有可能最终地攻破并夺取旧的文化堡垒。其次我们应该看到行政上明确地了解政策精神对改制工作是很重要的因素，同学应争取行政进行有益的改革，行政上又须经常研究和解决同学的问题。在改革中党团员应起积极带头作用，帮助并发动同学来解决学习上的问题，保证政策的贯彻。同时，在执行改革之先，要深入了解情况，进行必要的调查研究，结合自己院系的具体情况来执行上级规定，另一个应该归结到的经验教训是：一定要动员群众思想，了解为什么这样改，改了有什么好处；并时刻听取群众的意见和困难，不坚持群众路线，便只好等待失败。
    迅速依照高教会的课程暂行规定的精神，改革旧教育，已是各大学迫切的课题，反对只满足于表面的课程名目的相符，要经常不断地改善教学方法教学内容，接受他校的经验教训，摒弃坏的，发扬并巩固已有成果，尽快地改造旧教育，准备迎接人民祖国的文化建设高潮！
