Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 20th. South Jiangsu held an All-Circles People's Representative Conference from October 25th to 31st. This conference was convened on the basis of the successive convening of All-Circles People's Representative Conferences in various cities and some counties in South Jiangsu. A total of 485 representatives attended, most of whom were elected by the All-Circles People's Representative Conferences and people's organizations, institutions, and schools in various places, and a small number of representatives were invited by the government. The representatives included workers, farmers, women, youth students, cultural and educational circles, freelance professions, industrial and commercial circles, religious circles, enlightened gentry, as well as specially invited representatives and representatives from the South Jiangsu Administrative Office, the South Jiangsu District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and the People's Liberation Army. In early October, before the official meeting, 27 representatives from all walks of life first formed a preparatory committee. The preparatory committee also organized two committees: one was the Representative Credentials Committee, which reviewed the qualifications of the representatives and the allocation of quotas; the other was the Autumn and Winter Work Research Committee, which made preliminary discussions based on the tasks of the Autumn and Winter Work proposed by the South Jiangsu District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. The Work Research Committee also held nine meetings of various sizes, studying in detail the Draft of the Provisional Regulations on Rent Reduction in Rural Areas of the New Liberated Areas of East China by the East China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Supplementary Measures for the Implementation of the Provisional Regulations on Rent Reduction in Rural Areas of the South Jiangsu Administrative Region and the Regulations on Autumn Grain and Forage Collection of the Administrative Office of South Jiangsu. After repeated discussions and revisions, a preliminary foundation was prepared for the conference. Two days before the meeting, representatives from various places discussed the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the report of Rao Shushi, Secretary of the East China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, at the People's Representative Conference of Songjiang County, and separately convened symposiums for workers, farmers, youth students, and specially invited representatives. The persons in charge of the South Jiangsu Administrative Office explained the requirements and expectations for the conference, solicited opinions from the representatives on the conference, and repeatedly requested the representatives to engage in democratic consultation in the spirit of knowing everything and saying everything, and to concentrate on discussing the important issues that urgently needed to be resolved in South Jiangsu at present.

　　The conference officially opened on the 25th. After Chen Pixian, Secretary of the South Jiangsu District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, delivered the opening speech, Guan Wenwei, Director of the Administrative Office, Zhu Luxian from the visiting North Jiangsu delegation, and representatives from all walks of life in South Jiangsu, including Wu Jiamin, Zhong Min, Rong Desheng, Qian Sunqing, Jiang Weiqi, Yao Huiquan, and Ouyang Huilin, spoke for 39 people. On the 26th and 27th, Director Guan Wenwei, who had returned from attending the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, conveyed the spirit and resolutions of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Chen Pixian reported on the future work policy and suggestions for the four major tasks of the autumn and winter work. Liu Jiping, Deputy Director of the Administrative Office, reported on the government work from July to September.

　　The fourth and fifth days of the meeting were group discussion sessions. The representatives were divided into 18 groups according to region, and the presidium and others participated in the group meetings separately. Each group first spent half a day discussing the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, focusing on the leadership of the working class in the people's democratic dictatorship, opposing feudalism and bureaucratic capitalism, opposing imperialism, and the three issues of uniting with the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. The representatives studied each article from the general program to the detailed rules and gradually reached a unanimous understanding.

　　The group meetings then discussed the three reports of Guan Wenwei, Chen Pixian, and Liu Jiping, as well as the Draft of the Provisional Regulations on Rent Reduction in Rural Areas of the New Liberated Areas of East China, the Supplementary Measures for the Implementation of the Rent Reduction Regulations by the Administrative Office, the Draft Provisional Measures for the Collection of Public Grain and Forage in the Autumn of 1949, and the Draft Provisional Measures for the Collection of Business Tax by the South Jiangsu Administrative Office. They carefully studied each article on the basic public grain sharing standards between landlords and tenants, the progressive public grain grade standards, and the reduction and exemption measures in the autumn collection. All groups unanimously supported the three reports and three regulations and measures. The representatives believed that the problems that they could not understand in the past were now discussed clearly, and they felt very happy. Some representatives initially had concerns, but after promoting the spirit of democracy and conducting careful discussions, everyone spoke freely, and almost all representatives in each group had the opportunity to speak. Everyone believed that these measures and drafts were extremely reasonable under the current conditions, unanimously agreed, and put forward many good opinions on some specific provisions. In particular, the farmer representatives had great confidence in the autumn collection. Liu Arong said: For our own liberation, we are willing to bear the public grain, and thousands of farmers will definitely actively complete the public grain task and support the front. The conference also passed a resolution on returning the spring loan grain but returning all those below the progressive starting point (Note: This spring, when the army crossed the river, the grain and forage borrowed in various parts of South Jiangsu were originally scheduled to be returned after autumn. Currently, due to the unfinished war, strong support is still needed, and the local construction undertakings require huge amounts, so it was decided not to return the above-mentioned loan grain. However, in order to take care of the lives of poor farmers, it was decided to return all those below the progressive starting point).

　　On the sixth and seventh days of the conference, representatives from various regions successively expressed comprehensive opinions at the conference, expressed their support for the future autumn and winter work tasks and their willingness to resolutely implement them, and unanimously expressed their satisfaction and admiration for the government work report and the kind leadership and humble attitude of the party and government leaders during the conference. Kuang Gangshou, a farmer representative from Wuxi, He Qigang, a farmer representative from Zhenjiang District, and others said: Farmers are willing to take out the spirit of frugality and guarantee to the conference that they will complete the autumn collection ahead of schedule and take the lead in paying good grain. They also enthusiastically said to the portrait of Chairman Mao: "We farmers have turned over and raised our heads, thanks to Chairman Mao." Worker representatives Kong Lingzong and Luo Junfa said: We workers have a responsibility to help our farmer brothers turn over. Only by eliminating feudal exploitation in a step-by-step manner can industrial production have a future. We hope that farmers will organize themselves quickly. Jiangsu Min, a representative from the industrial and commercial circles in Zhenjiang District, said: The government has indeed given us great consideration in urban taxation and has provided a lot of help in developing production. We should abide by government laws and regulations.

　　On the 31st, the Proposal Review Committee reported to the conference on the handling of 1,285 proposals, classified them into two major categories according to their importance and urgency, and handed them over to the relevant government departments for handling. After the conference unanimously passed five resolutions, it closed in an excited and joyful atmosphere. During the conference, workers, farmers, youth students, and children presented flags and flowers to the conference and delivered congratulatory speeches.

  　苏南举行人民代表会议         
    经会前充分协商酝酿及会上民主讨论各界代表对政府各项措施获一致意见
    【新华社上海二十日电】苏南各界人民代表会议在十月二十五日到三十一日举行。这个会议是在苏南各个市和若干县先后召开各界人民代表会的基础上召开的，出席代表共四百八十五人，大多数由各地的各界人民代表会议及人民团体、机关、学校推选产生，少数代表系由政府聘请。代表成份包括工人、农民、妇女、青年学生、文教界、自由职业界、工商界、宗教界、开明士绅，另有特邀代表及苏南行政公署、中共苏南区党委、人民解放军的代表。十月初，在正式会议召开之前，各界代表人物二十七人先行组成筹备委员会。筹委会下又组织了两个委员会，一个是代表审查委员会，审查代表资格及名额分配；另一个是秋冬两季工作研究委员会，以中共苏南区党委提出的秋冬两季工作任务为基础，作了初步的商讨。工作研究委员会还举行了大小九次会议，详细研究了中共中央华东局关于华东新区农村减租暂行条例草案及苏南行署关于苏南行政区农村减租暂行条例实施补充办法、行署秋季征收公粮公草条例诸草案，经过反复讨论，一再修正，为大会准备好初步基础。会前两日，各地代表以县市为单位讨论人民政协共同纲领与中共中央华东局书记饶漱石在松江县人民代表会上的报告，并分别召集工人、农民、青年学生、特邀代表等座谈。苏南行署负责人在会上说明对会议要求和希望，征求代表对会议的意见，一再要求到会代表以知无不言、言无不尽的精神从事民主协商，并在会上集中精神讨论当前苏南迫切需要解决的重要问题。
    二十五日大会正式开幕。在中共苏南区党委书记陈丕显致开幕词后，行署主任管文蔚，来宾苏北代表团朱履先，苏南各界代表吴嘉民、钟民、荣德生、钱孙卿、蒋维奇、姚惠泉、欧阳惠林等三十九人讲了话。二十六、二十七两日，出席人民政协归来的管文蔚主任传达人民政协的精神和决议，陈丕显报告关于今后工作方针及秋冬两季工作四大任务的建议，行署刘季平副主任报告七月至九月三个月政府工作。
    会议第四、五两天为小组讨论会。代表们按地区划分为十八个小组，主席团等分别参加小组会议。各小组首先以半天时间讨论人民政协共同纲领，着重地讨论了人民民主专政中的工人阶级的领导，反对封建主义、官僚资本主义、反对帝国主义，以及联合苏联及人民民主国家三个问题。代表们从总纲到细则逐条研究，逐渐得到一致的认识。
    小组会接着对管文蔚、陈丕显、刘季平三个报告和华东新区农村减租暂行条例草案、行署执行减租条例的实施补充办法、一九四九年秋季征收公粮公草暂行办法草案、苏南行政公署营业税征收暂行办法草案等作了讨论，对秋征中基本公粮业佃分担标准、累进公粮等级标准及减免办法等，逐条慎重研究。各组对三个报告和三个条例办法都一致拥护。代表们认为：过去放在肚子里想不通的问题，这次都摆开来谈清楚了，觉得很愉快。有些代表开始还有顾虑，经过发扬民主精神进行慎重讨论之后，大家都畅所欲言，各个小组中几乎全部代表都得到发言的机会。大家都认为这些办法和草案在目前条件下极为合理，一致同意，并对有些具体规定提出许多好的意见。特别是农民代表对秋征抱极大信心。刘阿荣说：为了自己的解放，我们乐意负担公粮，千千万万农民一定积极完成公粮任务，支援前线。大会并通过春季借粮免还但在累进起征点以下者全还（按：今春大军渡江时，在苏南各地所借粮草，原定秋后归还，目前因战争尚未结束，仍需大力支援，且地方建设事业需用浩大，故决定上项借粮不予归还。但为照顾贫苦农民生活，决定在累进起征点以下者全部归还）的决议案。
    大会第六、七两日，各地区各地代表在大会上相继发表综合性意见，对今后秋冬两季工作任务表示拥护并愿坚决执行，对政府工作报告及会间各党政首长亲切领导、虚心谦逊态度一致表示满意和钦佩。无锡农民匡冈寿、镇江区农民何启刚等代表表示：农民愿拿出节衣缩食精神，向大会保证提前完成秋征，带头缴好粮。他们还热情地对着毛主席像说：“我们农民翻了身抬了头，多亏毛主席。”工人代表孔令宗、罗俊发说：我们工人有责任帮助农民兄弟翻身。只有有步骤地消灭封建剥削，工业生产才有前途。我们希望农民赶快组织起来。镇江区工商界代表江苏民说：在城市税收上政府确实给我们很大照顾，在发展生产上得到很多帮助，我们应当遵行政府法令。
    三十一日，提案审查委员会把一千二百八十五件提案处理情形向大会报告，分别轻重缓急归并两大类交给有关政府部门办理。大会在一致通过五项决议后，即在兴奋愉快气氛中闭幕。在大会期间，工人、农民、青年学生、儿童等曾向大会献旗献花，并致祝词。
