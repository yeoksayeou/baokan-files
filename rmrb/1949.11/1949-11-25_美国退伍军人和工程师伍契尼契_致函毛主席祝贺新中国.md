American Veteran and Engineer Wuciniqi
Sends Letter to Chairman Mao to Congratulate New China
    I will never forget my many memories in Yan'an, which have been very helpful to me in my country's struggle for peace.

    [Beijing News] American veteran and engineer Wuciniqi sent a letter to Chairman Mao to celebrate the founding of the People's Republic of China. The letter is as follows: Dear Chairman,
    Congratulations to you! I am an American, but I share the joy of the Chinese people in establishing a People's Republic. Since 1945, the news of your struggle and victory has given me great hope. There were times when I needed courage and strength in the United States, and this courage and strength came from the great success of the Chinese people in fighting for liberation and world peace.
    As an American officer who participated in the anti-fascist war, it was my privilege to defend our own people and all oppressed people during my time in the people's army.
    In 1945, I was saved by the Chinese people and the Eighth Route Army in North China. They saved me from an ancient temple in Nantou Village, five miles east of Fenyang, Shanxi.
    From August to October 1945, I was able to observe firsthand how the Chinese people, as our strong allies, were fighting and how they were establishing an autonomous government in the liberated areas of hundreds of miles, which gave them human dignity that I could not see elsewhere in China. I will never forget my many memories in Yan'an, which have been very helpful to me in my country's struggle for peace.
    Today, your people are fighting for complete freedom, and it is ironic that the Chairman of the Kuomintang Guangzhou Government is Yan Xishan, the "model" of the Shanxi warlord. We once discovered that he was completely a collaborator of Japanese imperialism, and it was he who betrayed my mission in Nantou. He hoped the Japanese puppets would kill me and three American soldiers! He ignored the Chinese people. An old farmer, a friend of the Eighth Route Army, foiled Yan's plan. This old man blocked Yan's path, just as the Chinese people blocked the path of all traitors, whether they are named Yan, Jiang, or Wall Street. History has recorded these events in flamboyant letters in the history of the twentieth century.
    The Chinese people have swept away the garbage, their houses and doorways are clean, and now for the first time they are beginning to integrate with millions of peace-loving people around the world to determine their destiny.
    We Americans struggled for peace through the difficult period of 1945-48, and now in 1949, your people have given us a great gift, giving us new strength for the work ahead. I need not tell you that the progressive movement, especially the Wallace movement of 1949 (many of us participated in the leadership of this movement), has been and is a contribution to our desire to build a world of peace-loving people.
    We will strive to build ties of friendship and understanding between the United States and China. The Chinese people have sacrificed much blood and flesh for the American people and all people. Now is the time for us to show our gratitude and help build a new China. As an engineer and businessman, I will continue on the path of peace, promoting and developing trade with your country, so that American knowledge and work can be united with your people to jointly carry out the cause of world peace.
    Michigan Congressman G. G. Sadowski published a letter from me in the "New York Times" and the Congressional Record on August 1, 1949, discussing world trade and the path to peace.
    There is still much to be done. From this American factory, I extend my hand, warmly welcoming you and the people of China, especially the brothers and sisters and friends I know in the Jin-Shaan-Sui District and in Yan'an.
    Congratulations to all of you! On this glorious Double Tenth Festival, this festival, after forty years of struggle, now lays the foundation for building a free Chinese nation.

　　美国退伍军人和工程师伍契尼契
　　致函毛主席祝贺新中国
    我将永远不忘我在延安的许多记忆，这些记忆在我国争取和平时对我是很有帮助的。  　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    【北京讯】美国退伍军人和工程师伍契尼契致函毛主席庆祝中华人民共和国的建立。该函如下：亲爱的主席先生：
    向您道贺！我是个美国人，可是我分享中华人民在建立人民共和国时的愉快。从一九四五年起，你们的奋斗及胜利消息，使我抱着很大的希望，曾经有些时候当我在美国需要勇敢和力量的时候，这勇敢和力量是从中华人民争取解放和争取世界和平所得的伟大成功中得来的。
    作为一个曾经参加反法西斯战争的美国军官以及在我穿了人民的军装的时期内，保卫我们自己的人民，同时也保卫一切受压迫的人民，是我的特权。
    在一九四五年我在华北得到中国人民及八路军的救命之恩，他们从一个古庙中救了我，这庙是在山西汾阳以东五里的南都（ｎａｎｔｏ）村里。
    从一九四五年八月至十月，我和军队同时进行，得以亲眼观察几百里地的解放区内作为我们坚强的盟友的中华人民怎样在战斗和他们怎样在建立一个自治的政府，这政府使他们获得了人的尊严，这是我在中国别处所不能见到的。我将永远不忘我在延安的许多记忆，这些记忆在我国争取和平时对我是很有帮助的。
    今天你们人民正在争取完全的自由，而国民党广州政府主席是阎锡山，那是带有讽刺性的，他是山西军阀的“模型”，我们曾经发觉他完全是日本帝国主义者的合作者，也正是他出卖了我在南都的任务。他希望日本傀儡杀死我及三个美国兵！他无视了中国人民。一个老农民，也就是八路军的朋友把阎的计划破坏了。这个老百姓阻碍阎的道路，正象中国人民挡住了一切叛卖者的道路一样，不论他们是姓阎姓蒋或叫华尔街。历史已经把这些事迹用炫耀的字体纪载在二十世纪的历史上。
    中国人民已经扫除了垃圾，他们的房屋及门口都已清洁了，而现在首次开始和成百万世界爱好和平的人们融合在一起来制定他们的命运了。
    我们美国人争取和平，经历着一九四五——四八年的艰苦时期，现在贵国人民在一九四九年给了我们一个伟大的礼物，使我们对于放在我们面前的工作有了新的力量。我无须告诉你们，进步的运动，特别是一九四九年的华莱士运动（我们中有许多人参加这个运动的领导工作）已经是并且现在是我们对于建立全世界人民爱好和平的愿望的一种贡献。
    我们将为建立美国及中国之间的友谊及了解的联系而奋斗。为了美国人民以及一切人民，中国人民已牺牲了许多血肉。现在是我们应当表现我们的感谢而去帮助建设一个新中国的时期了。作为一个工程师和商人，我将继续在和平之路上，促进并发展与贵国的贸易，由此美国人的知识和工作能与贵国人民联合起来，共同进行世界和平的事业。
    密执安州的议员Ｇ．Ｇ．赛杜斯基（ＧｅｏｒｇｅＧ．Ｓａｄｏｗｓｋｉ）曾把我的一封信发表在“纽约时报”及一九四九年八月一日的国会记录上，这信是论及世界贸易与和平之路的。
    尚有许多事情需要做，从这美国的工场，我伸出我的手，热烈的欢迎您和中国的人民尤其是在晋陕绥区的和在延安我所认识的许多兄弟姊妹和朋友们。
    恭贺你们大家！在这光辉的双十节，这节日，经过了四十年的斗争，现在树立了建立自由的中华民族的基础。
