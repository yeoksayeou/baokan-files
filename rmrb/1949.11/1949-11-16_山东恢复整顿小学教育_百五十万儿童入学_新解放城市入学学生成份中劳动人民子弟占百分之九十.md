Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 15th. Over the past year, Shandong Province has achieved great success in restoring and rectifying primary education. Shandong's education was once brought to a standstill due to the key offensive of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits in 1947. Through a year of efforts, 22,970 primary schools have now been restored, reaching more than 75 percent of the original 30,600 schools. There are now 48,215 teachers and 1,543,068 students of both sexes, accounting for more than one-quarter of the province's school-age children (estimated at about 6 million).

　　In the restoration of primary schools in the old liberated areas, a positive approach and prudent steps were taken, starting with teacher training. The Provincial Department of Education and various prefectural offices have successively held teacher training classes. After receiving training, teachers' confused thoughts since the suspension of schools gradually cleared up, and they understood the government's policies and methods for restoring education. After going to the countryside, they publicized these policies to the peasants and opened schools based on local economic conditions and people's demands. As a result, primary schools were successfully restored. For example, the Jiaodong District has established 8,127 primary schools with 581,635 students, reaching more than 86 percent of the 674,985 students before the suspension. The Bohai District has 7,820 primary schools, averaging one primary school for every two villages. After the land reform, farmer's children accounted for 90 percent of the enrolled children. During the restoration process, primary schools generally paid attention to cultural studies, established systems for attending classes, requesting leave, and conducting assessments; overcame the past phenomenon of rural teachers doing odd jobs and students not being able to read after attending school, initially met the cultural needs of farmers, and gained the help of farmers.

　　The focus of primary education in newly liberated cities is on rectification and transformation. Jinan City now has 129 primary schools, an increase of 9 compared to before liberation, with 1,468 teachers and 44,382 students. Before liberation, Xuzhou City had 85 primary schools, and now 70 have been restored, with a total of 19,850 students, an increase of 8 percent compared to before liberation. Qingdao City now has 119 primary schools with 55,358 students resuming classes, reaching more than 90 percent of the 60,205 students before liberation. The composition of enrolled children shows an increasing number of children of workers, urban poor, staff, and small vendors, accounting for about 90 percent of the total number of enrolled students. After the resumption of classes, various places first announced the decrees of the People's Government, reformed administrative leadership, abolished the reactionary systems of the Kuomintang that hindered the development of children, adopted textbooks compiled and printed by the People's Government, and launched a movement to respect teachers and love students; in addition, teacher training classes were held in a planned manner. For example, Xuzhou City held an educational research conference for 365 people during the winter vacation, and Jinan City held weekly lectures, which greatly helped teachers' ideological transformation and professional learning. At the same time, the leading organs of primary schools also promoted the spirit of democracy, established new systems such as various meetings, requests for instructions, reports, inspections, and summaries, and regularly held forums to conduct teaching research and improve professional skills. Xuzhou City also implemented methods for teachers to observe each other's classes, learn from each other, and critique each other.

　　In addition to the above achievements in primary education in Shandong Province over the past year, some areas still have a simplistic view of tasks, only pursuing numbers and not paying attention to the consolidation of primary schools, and the phenomenon of not paying attention to cultural learning and moving the instructions of political and ideological education in middle schools to primary schools. The Shandong Provincial Department of Education has criticized and corrected these shortcomings at the provincial primary education cadres conference held in October this year.

　　山东恢复整顿小学教育
  　百五十万儿童入学
    新解放城市入学学生成份中劳动人民子弟占百分之九十
    【新华社济南十五日电】山东省小学教育的恢复和整顿的工作，一年来已经获得巨大成绩。由于一九四七年蒋匪的重点进攻，山东省教育曾经陷于停顿。经一年来的努力，现在已经恢复了小学二万二千九百七十处，达到原有三万零六百多处的百分之七十五强。现有教师四万八千二百一十五人；男女学生一百五十四万三千零六十八人，占全省学龄儿童（估计约六百万）的四分之一强。
    老区农村小学在恢复中采取了积极的方针和稳重的步骤，首先训练教师。省教育厅和各专署先后分别举办了教员训练班。教员受训练后，停办以来的混乱思想逐渐澄清，对人民政府恢复教育的方针政策和办法有了了解，下乡后向农民宣传，并根据各地经济条件和人民要求开办学校。因此小学得以顺利恢复。如胶东区已举办小学八千一百二十七处，拥有学生五十八万一千六百三十五人，已达停办前学生数六十七万四千九百八十五人的百分之八十六强。渤海区已有小学七千八百二十处，平均每两个村有小学一所。在土地改革后，入学儿童中农民子弟已达百分之九十。在恢复过程中。各小学一般注意了文化学习，确立了上课、请假、考核制度；克服了过去农村教师乱打杂、上学不识字一类的现象，初步满足了农民的文化要求，并获得农民的帮助。
    新解放城市的小学教育工作，首先着重在整顿和改造。现在济南市共有小学一百二十九处，较解放前增加了九处，有教员一千四百六十八人，学生四万四千三百八十二人。徐州市解放前原有小学八十五处，现已恢复达七十处，共有学生一万九千八百五十人，较解放前增加百分之八。青岛市现有小学一百一十九处，复课学生五万五千三百五十八人，已达解放前学生数六零二零五人的百分之九十强。入学儿童的成份，工人、城市贫民、职员、小商贩等的子弟日益增多，约占入学学生总数的百分之九十。各地在复课后，首先宣布人民政府的法令，改进行政领导，废除国民党妨害儿童发展的反动制度，采用人民政府编印的课本，并开展尊师爱生运动；此外还有计划地举办教员训练班。如徐州市寒假期间就举办了三百六十五人的教育研究会，济南市举办了星期讲座，对教员思想改造、业务学习，都有很大帮助。同时，小学的领导机关还发扬了民主精神，确立了各种会议、请示、报告、检查总结等新制度，并定期召开座谈会，进行教学研究，提高业务。徐州市还实行了教员互相听课、互相学习和批评的办法。
    山东省小学教育工作一年来除获得以上成绩外，部分地区还存在着只追求数目字而不注意小学的巩固的单纯任务观点，和不重视文化学习、把中学的政治思想教育指示搬到小学中去的现象。这些缺点，山东省人民政府教育厅已经在今年十月召开的全省小学教育干部会议上予以批判和纠正。
