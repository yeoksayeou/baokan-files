Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 17th: Employees of the Kuomintang puppet Resource Committee stationed in Hong Kong issued a declaration, breaking away from the Kuomintang reactionaries and protecting assets remaining in Hong Kong. The full text of the declaration is as follows:

　　We participated in the work of the Resource Committee in the past, handling the production and sales of exported minerals, with the aim of serving the country and the people, promoting production, earning foreign exchange, and thereby promoting national construction. Since the reactionaries disregarded the will of the people, launched a frantic civil war, and wantonly carried out destruction and slaughter, the work we participated in has been impossible to carry out and completely contrary to our original purpose. Recently, the corrupt bureaucrats of the reactionaries, in their death throes, have used their consistent selfish and fraudulent tricks, using various conspiracies to seize these assets belonging to the country and the people, which makes us, the workers responsible for managing these assets, feel heartbroken and unable to sit idly by. We believe that our work is for the country and the people, and the assets we manage are the assets of the country and the people. Today, the people of the whole country have overthrown the dark rule that violates the interests of the people and established their own government, vigorously launching bright construction under the revolutionary order. Now, the domestic mining areas have been liberated one after another and are being continuously produced by the people. The minerals, funds and all production equipment stored in Hong Kong originally belong to the mining areas and should of course be returned to the mining areas for public ownership by the people. We find it difficult to agree with the Kuomintang reactionary bureaucrats' private disposal of these assets to enrich their own pockets. Therefore, from today onwards, we solemnly declare our separation from the Kuomintang reactionary government. We are determined to stick to our posts, protect assets for the people, and await the people's takeover. From now on, we refuse to handle and will not recognize any disposal of these assets by the reactionaries. In addition to telegraphing the Beijing People's Government, we also hope that all sectors will provide just support. This is our declaration.

　　宣言
    【新华社广州十七日电】伪资源委员会驻港员工发表宣言，脱离国民党反动残余，保护留港资产。宣言原文如下：
    我们过去参加资源委员会的工作，办理出口矿物的产销业务，目的在为国家人民服务，促进生产，争取外汇，从而推动国家的建设。自从反动派不顾人民意志，发动疯狂内战，肆意破坏杀戮，已使我们所参加的工作，无法展开，与我们所抱目的完全违背了。最近反动派的贪污官僚在其垂死挣扎之际，施其一贯自私舞弊的伎俩，以种种诡计，想侵夺这些属于国家人民的资产，更使我们负有责任管理这些资产的工作者痛心疾首，不忍坐视。我们认定我们工作是为国家人民而工作，我们经营的资产是国家人民的资产。今天全国人民推翻了违反人民利益的黑暗统治，建立起人民自己的政府，在革命秩序下大力展开光明的建设。现在国内各矿区，已先后解放由人民继续生产之中，香港所存的矿物，资金和一切生产器材，原来是属于各矿区的，当然应该交还各矿区，为人民所公有，我们对于国民党反动官僚私自处置这些资产，来充实他们的私囊，义难附和。所以我们从今天起，郑重申明脱离国民党反动政府。决心坚持岗位，为人民保护资产，听候人民接收。今后反动派对这些资产的一切处置，我们拒绝办理，概不承认，除电达北京人民政府外，尚希各界予以正义的支持，特此宣言。吴志翔、龚家麟、李新民、梁＠、冯日宾、林艾园、孟颂南、毕文翰、简根贤、吴鑫、朱润琚、曾庆锴、郑文钦、鲍克超、杨丽生、宋达汉、阮顺元、刘②章、王守承、王忠荣、郑玲、李鼐昌、阮仁达、司徒康、郭世镗、曹子华、黎日初、梁建邦、杨绚、郑炳权、杨庆春、陈琪文、陈志清、谭汉伟、马忠良。
