　　Facts

　　The defendants Wald, Leiberg, Kristan, Hickney, and Sun Shiro are five foreigners residing in Shenyang. On September 27th of this year, at around 8:00 AM, Wald, in order to dismantle a garage to repair the yard wall, ordered worker Ji Yuheng to dismantle a concrete pillar. The pillar was made of concrete and rebar and was not something that one person could dismantle. Around 3:00 PM, Ji Yuheng, exhausted from the long hours, was unable to continue working and applied to Leiberg, saying, "I really can't complete such heavy labor alone," requesting help from other workers. Leiberg immediately told Wald, who, upon hearing this, used the excuse that Ji Yuheng refused to work and, without allowing Ji to explain, unreasonably fired Ji and expelled him from No. 38, Sanjing Road.

　　On October 11th, at around 8:00 AM, Ji Yuheng went to Wald's place to demand the withheld wages, severance pay, vacation pay, and nine days of regular wages he was owed after being fired. Wald not only refused to pay the arrears but also cursed at Ji Yuheng, "Bastard! Get out!" Ji tried to argue, but Wald grabbed Ji Yuheng's hand and dragged him outside. Hickney grabbed Ji Yuheng's right arm with his right hand, and the two kicked Ji Yuheng in the legs from behind, pushing and kicking Ji Yuheng downstairs. When they reached the door downstairs, defendant Sun Shiro arrived and joined in the beating, grabbing Ji Yuheng's left hand. The three criminals forcefully pushed Ji Yuheng to the ground on the steps at the door, and Sun Shiro stepped forward and kicked Ji Yuheng before leaving one after another.

　　At 9:00 AM on the same day, Leiberg called Ji from downstairs to the accounting room upstairs in the front building, forcing Ji to accept nine days' wages. Ji refused to accept because he could not receive vacation pay, severance pay, and withheld wages. Leiberg forced Ji to sign, but when he failed, he forcefully pushed Ji out of the room, causing him to fall next to the outdoor heating package. Ji's brother, Ji Yufeng, came to mediate upon seeing this, but Leiberg pushed him out of the vestibule and locked the door. Leiberg immediately reported to Wald, who came out of the room, and the two dragged Ji Yuheng downstairs, kicking and beating him as they went, until they reached the corner of the second-level staircase. Sun Hengli witnessed this and ran to tell Chinese worker Ji Yufeng. Ji Yufeng also rushed from downstairs to mediate. Leiberg immediately stepped forward to stop him, punching Ji Yufeng twice, and then hugged Ji Yufeng. At this time, Kristan ran up from downstairs, grabbed Ji Yufeng's right arm with his right hand, slapped Ji Yufeng twice with his left hand, and punched his shoulder three times. At the same time, Wald forcefully pushed Ji Yuheng down, causing Ji Yuheng to hit the lowest step of the second-level staircase, injuring his right forehead, and held Ji Yuheng down with his left hand while punching Ji's left eye socket three times with his right hand, causing a skinning injury on Ji Yuheng's right forehead, and causing him to faint and lose consciousness. While the criminals were committing the crime, Chinese workers Yu Yongbin and others arrived and, seeing the situation, became extremely angry and shouted, "Don't beat Chinese people!" Wald and others then left and went upstairs. Later, after being reported by fellow workers, the Shenyang Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau and the court's forensic doctors came to the scene to conduct an examination and found it to be true. The Municipal Public Security Bureau filed a public prosecution with this court.

　　Reasons

　　1. Regarding the part of unreasonably dismissing Chinese workers and deducting wages:

　　Defendant Wald firmly denied forcibly dismissing Ji Yuheng, arguing, "Ji Yuheng resigned voluntarily." However, according to witness Zou Yuanji, "Around 2:00 PM on September 28th, Wald fired Ji Yuheng, and Ji asked me to plead for him, but it was ineffective." This is sufficient to prove that Ji did not resign voluntarily but was forcibly dismissed by Wald.

　　It is found that Ji Yuheng is a messenger at No. 38, Sanjing Road, and has been working for thirteen years as an old worker over fifty years old. Defendant Wald ordered this old worker to do excessively heavy labor that one person could not handle. However, after Ji accepted the task, he not only did not refuse but also worked hard. When he was exhausted and could no longer complete this overly heavy labor alone, Ji requested help from other workers, but Wald refused the worker's reasonable request and dismissed him. This is an illegal and unreasonable act.

　　Regarding defendant Wald's deduction of wages, the criminal only admitted to reissuing Ji Yuheng's nine days' wages; used the excuse that Ji resigned voluntarily and did not issue severance pay; and refused to return Ji Yuheng's three years and six months of wage deductions and three and a half months of vacation pay, claiming that "it is necessary to request instructions from the Washington government before returning it." It is found that vacation pay is the wages for the holidays that Ji Yuheng should receive for selling his labor force without resting throughout the year. At the same time, it is also a common annual practice for workers to receive vacation pay at Wald's place. The withheld wages are the 6% "savings" that Wald deducted from the workers' wages, which is actually the wages owed to the workers. Furthermore, according to the decrees of our People's Government, "When the employer dismisses a worker, ... severance pay equivalent to half a month to three months of wages shall be paid based on the length of service of the employee." From this, it can be seen that Wald's refusal to pay Ji Yuheng's vacation pay, severance pay, and withheld wages is an unreasonable and illegal act. It is found that Wald resides in Chinese territory and employs Chinese workers, and must abide by the decrees of the Chinese People's Government. Therefore, Wald shall reissue Ji Yuheng nine days' wages of US$9, three and a half months of vacation pay of US$105, two months of severance pay of US$60, and all withheld wages, all of which shall be paid in local currency at the local market price.

　　2. Regarding the part of gathering to beat and scold Chinese workers:

　　Defendant Wald insulted Ji Yuheng: "Bastard, get out!" The criminal admitted to saying, "God damn you! Bastard." and admitted that the meaning of this sentence "is sometimes very impolite." This point was not only heard clearly by Ji Yuheng (who understands a little English), but Wald's victim Hickney stated: "Wald asked me to ask Ji Yuheng what he was doing there? Ji said he was there to get money. Wald immediately became angry and said 'Get out!' and grabbed Ji Yuheng's hand and pulled him outside." In addition, witness Zhang Zhongying also testified: "Wald said in English at the time: 'Bastard! Get out.'" This is sufficient to prove that Wald's crime of insulting Ji Yuheng and insulting the personality of Chinese workers is true.

　　Regarding the part where defendants Wald, Hickney, Sun Shiro, and others pushed and kicked Ji Yuheng downstairs from the back building of No. 38, Sanjing Road: Wald admitted to "pulling Ji Yuheng's hand downstairs." But when asked, "Why did you pull Ji Yuheng's hand?" Wald claimed, "I was afraid he (referring to Ji Yuheng) would jump down the stairs." When asked Sun Shiro, "Why did you help Wald beat Ji Yuheng?" He replied, "I grabbed Ji's hand on Wald's order, I didn't kick Ji. It was Hickney who pushed him and kicked him." When asked Hickney, he replied, "I pushed Ji Yuheng, and I feel very sorry for him now." He continued, "I very much dislike Wald's attitude and behavior towards Ji Yuheng. This is an act of violence, and he (referring to Wald) has no right to do this." and said, "This is an act of human rights violation." All of this proves that the three defendants Wald, Hickney, and Sun Shiro shirked criminal responsibility from each other, equivocated, and could not justify themselves. Moreover, when witnesses Zhang Zhongying, Fang Pinqing, and Yue Shanyi stated during the in-court questioning: "Wald grabbed Ji Yuheng's hand and pushed him hard. Hickney also grabbed Ji Yuheng's hand. The two pushed and kicked Ji Yuheng to the door of the stairs. Sun Shiro came up and also grabbed Ji's hand, and the three of them threw Ji Yuheng to the ground." Based on this, according to the confessions of the defendants and the in-court testimonies of the corroborating witnesses, it is sufficient to prove that the criminal behavior of Wald, Hickney, and Sun Shiro in beating Ji Yuheng at No. 38, Sanjing Road is all true.

　　Regarding the part where defendant Wald and others gathered to beat Ji Yuheng and Ji Yufeng for the second time at 9:00 AM on the 11th, causing injuries: The victim Ji Yuheng stated, "Leiberg told me to go upstairs to collect the money and forced me to sign. Because the money was not enough, I refused to sign, and Leiberg pushed me to the side of the heating package outside the accounting room. My brother Ji Yufeng came forward to mediate, but Leiberg pushed him out of the vestibule and locked the door. At this time, Leiberg called Wald out. Leiberg grabbed my right hand with his right hand and pushed me with his left hand. Wald kicked and beat me from behind and pushed me down the stairs. Just at the corner of the stairs, Ji Yufeng came up from downstairs again to mediate. Leiberg dropped me and punched Ji Yufeng twice and then hugged Ji Yufeng. Wald pushed me down to the ground at the corner of the stairs. At that time, my head hit the step on the stairs, breaking my right forehead, and Wald punched my left eye with his fist. After that, I lost consciousness." In response to this, when Wald and others were questioned, although they still tried to deny it in every possible way, Leiberg had to admit that he "hugged Ji Yufeng", Kristan admitted that he "grabbed Ji Yufeng's arm and hit him", and Wald admitted that he pulled Ji Yuheng downstairs with both hands, but he falsely claimed that "Ji Yuheng fainted because he fell." When Wald was questioned, "How do you explain the problem of Ji Yuheng being injured next to you?" Wald was speechless. However, according to the testimony of workers Sun Hengli, Yu Yongbin, and others: "I saw Wald hold down Ji Yuheng and was hitting him, Leiberg hugged Ji Yufeng, Kristan came up from downstairs, grabbed Ji Yufeng's right hand, slapped Ji Yufeng twice with his left hand, and punched Ji Yufeng's right shoulder three times." It is found that the victim Ji Yuheng was seriously injured by the beating, and fell to the ground unconscious. In addition to a photograph of the scene that can prove this, it was also recorded by Korea Kui, a forensic doctor of this court: The symptoms are "a non-cosmetic skinning wound measuring 5 cm long and 4 cm wide on the right side of the front of the head, the person is mentally unclear and incontinent." The name of the injury is "concussion and skinning wound," and the diagnostic opinion signed is "Needs urgent hospitalization, otherwise there is a risk of death." The forensic doctor determined the cause of Ji Yuheng's injury: "He was injured by violence, beating, pushing and bumping." After Ji Yuheng was sent to the hospital for emergency treatment, according to the diagnosis record of Dr. Li Jianping of Shenyang Municipal First Hospital: The name of the disease is "1. Concussion 2. Laceration on the right side of the head 3. Contusions on both arms and right lower limb." The above-mentioned examinations and diagnoses recorded the condition of Ji Yuheng's injuries consistent with the statements of the victim and witnesses, and consistent with the facts, proving that the testimony of the victim and witnesses regarding Wald and others' beating and causing injuries is entirely true. Therefore, the criminal behavior of Wald and others has been constituted.

　　It is found that the five criminals Wald and others reside in Chinese territory, unreasonably dismiss Chinese workers, deduct workers' wages, vacation pay, severance pay, and withheld wages, and gather to commit violence and beat Chinese workers Ji Yuheng and Ji Yufeng, constituting the crime of injuring the body and infringing on human rights, violating the laws of the People's Republic of China, and should be punished according to law. According to the severity of their crimes, the principal offender Wald is sentenced to six months of imprisonment, the accomplices Leiberg and Kristan are each sentenced to four months of imprisonment, and Sun Shiro and Hickney are each sentenced to three months of imprisonment, all suspended for one year, and expulsion from the territory of China. The medical expenses of 1,365,000 yuan in local currency for the treatment of the injured victim Ji Yuheng, and the loss of 2,500,000 yuan in local currency due to the inability to work during the recuperation period due to the injury, shall be borne by Wald. In addition, Ji Yuheng shall be paid the vacation pay, withheld wages, severance pay, and other funds he is entitled to. The judgment is as in the main text.

　　The prosecutor performed his duties in court for this case.

　　沈阳市人民法院
  　关于瓦尔德案的判决书
    【新华社沈阳二十六日电】沈阳市人民法院关于美侨瓦尔德等聚众毒殴中国工人姬玉衡及克扣工资等款案的判决书如下：沈阳市人民法院刑事附带民事判决书刑字第七九七一号
    一九四九年十一月二十一日
    被告　瓦尔德　男、年五十七岁、美国人、住本市三经路卅八号
    雷贝格　男、年三十岁、美国人、住同右
    克力斯坦　男、年四十一岁、德国人、住同右
    希克尼　男、年三十一岁、意国人、住同右
    巽四郎　男、年五十一岁、美籍日人、住同右
    右被告等，因聚众殴打工人致伤、克扣工资等款案件，经本院审理判决如左：
    主文
    被告瓦尔德克扣工资等款，聚众殴打工人致伤，处徒刑六个月，缓刑一年，驱逐出中国国境。
    被告雷贝格、克力斯坦殴打工人，各处徒刑四个月，各缓刑一年，驱逐出中国国境。
    被告希克尼、巽四郎殴打工人，各处徒刑三个月，各缓刑一年，驱逐出中国国境。
    瓦尔德应向姬玉衡给付三个半月休假金美元一百零五元，两月解雇金美元六十元，及九天之工资美元九元；工资扣留金按实际扣留数目全部发还。以上均按市价折合本币给付。并应赔偿姬玉衡之医药费本币一百三十六万五千元，生活损失费本币二百五十万元。
    事实
    被告瓦尔德、雷贝格、克力斯坦、希克尼、巽四郎五犯侨居沈阳。本年九月二十七日午前八时许，瓦尔德为拆除汽车房修补院墙，命令工人姬玉衡拆毁洋灰柱子。该柱子系洋灰铁筋所造，实非一人之力所能拆除。至午后三时许，姬玉衡因时间太久筋疲力尽，实不能再继续作下去时，才向雷贝格申请：“我一人确实不能完成这样重劳动”，要求其他工人帮助。雷当即转告瓦尔德，瓦闻后竟借口姬玉衡拒绝工作，并不准姬声辩理由，将姬无理解雇，并逐出三经路三十八号。
    十月十一日早八时许，姬玉衡赴瓦尔德处索取被解雇后应得之工资扣留金、解雇金、休假金和九天的正常工资。瓦尔德不但拒不支付欠款，反大骂姬玉衡“混蛋！滚出去！”姬拟加声辩，瓦尔德即抓着姬玉衡的手向外边拖，希克尼则以右手扯姬玉衡右臂，两人并在后面踢姬玉衡腿部，将姬玉衡推踢下楼，至楼下门口时，被告巽四郎赶到，参加殴打，拉住姬玉衡左手。三犯猛力将姬玉衡推倒在门口台阶地上，巽四郎又趋前踢姬玉衡一脚，然后相继离去。
    同日午前九时，雷贝格将姬从楼下唤至前楼楼上帐房，强制姬接受九天之工资。姬因不能领到休假金、解雇金、工资扣留金等款，拒绝接受。雷贝格强迫姬签字未果，即将姬从房中猛力推出，倒于室外暖气包旁。姬之弟姬玉峰见状前来排解，被雷推出穿堂门外，并将门锁闭后，雷立即报告瓦尔德，瓦从房中走出，二人将姬玉衡拖往楼下，并边踢边打，至二级楼梯转角处。孙恒利目睹后，奔告中国工人姬玉峰。姬玉峰又从楼下赶来排解。雷贝格立即上前阻拦，痛击姬玉峰两拳后，并将姬玉峰抱住，此时克力斯坦从楼下跑来，以右手抓住姬玉峰右臂，左手打姬玉峰两个耳光，并猛击肩头三拳。于此同时，瓦尔德将姬玉衡猛力推倒，致姬玉衡撞在第二级楼梯最下阶台上右额撞伤，并用左手按住姬玉衡，用右手在姬左眼眶上猛打三拳，致姬玉衡右额成剥皮伤一处，并晕迷不省人事。该犯等正行凶时，中国工人于永宾等赶到，见状气极，大呼“不要打中国人！”瓦尔德等始离开上楼。嗣经工友告发，由沈阳市人民政府公安局及本院法医等人员莅场勘验属实。由市公安局向本院提出公诉。
    理由
    一、无理解雇中国工人、克扣工资等款部分：
    被告瓦尔德坚决否认强制解雇姬玉衡，辩称：“姬玉衡是自动辞职的。”但据证人邹元绩称：“九月二十八日午后二时许，瓦尔德将姬玉衡解雇，姬托我求情，但无效。”此足证明姬非自动辞职，乃系瓦尔德强制解雇。
    查姬玉衡系三经路三十八号之信差，已工作十三年之久，年逾五十之老工人。被告瓦尔德却命令此年老工人，作一个人不能胜任的过重劳动。但姬接受任务后，非但未加拒绝，而且用力工作。迨至其精疲力尽，已不能独自完成这一过重的劳动时，姬才提出要求其他工人帮助而瓦尔德拒绝工人此一合理要求，竟予解雇。这是一种违法的无理行为。
    被告瓦尔德克扣工资等款一节，该犯仅承认补发姬玉衡九日工资；借口姬自动辞职不发解雇金；借口“须请示华盛顿政府批示后再行退还”，拒绝退还姬玉衡三年六个月之工资扣留金及三个半月休假金。查休假金系姬玉衡终年不休息出卖劳动力应得之假期内的工资。同时，工人在瓦尔德处领取休假金，也是常年的惯例工资。扣留金是瓦尔德从工人工资中扣除百分之六的“储金”，实乃欠发工人的工资。又根据我人民政府法令，“资方解雇工人时，……根据职工服务期间长短，应发给相当于半个月到三个月工资的解雇金。”由此可见，瓦尔德拒付姬玉衡休假金、解雇金与工资扣留金，实属无理非法行为。查瓦尔德侨居中国境内，雇庸中国工人，必须遵守中国人民政府的法令。因此，瓦尔德应补发姬玉衡九日工资美元九元，三个半月休假金美元一百零五元，两月解雇金美元六十元及全部工资扣留金，并均按本地市价折合本币给付。
    二、聚众殴打与谩骂中国工人部分：
    被告瓦尔德辱骂姬玉衡：“混蛋滚出去！”该犯承认说过：“上帝降你罪！混蛋。”并承认这句话的语义“有时是很不客气的话”。此点不仅姬玉衡（稍懂英语）听清，且瓦之伤案西克尼称：“瓦尔德叫我问姬玉衡在那里作什么？姬说来要钱。瓦尔德立刻发怒说“滚出去！”同时抓着姬玉衡的手向外边拉”。另证人张仲英亦证称：“瓦尔德当时用英语说：“混蛋！滚出去。”足证瓦尔德谩骂姬玉衡、污辱中国工人人格之罪行属实。
    被告瓦尔德、希克尼、巽四郎等从三经路三十八号后楼将姬玉衡推踢下楼部分：瓦尔德承认“拉过姬玉衡的手下楼”。但讯及“为什么要拉姬玉衡的手呢？”瓦推称：“我怕他（指姬玉衡）跳下楼去”。讯及巽四郎“为什么要帮助瓦尔德殴打姬玉衡呢？”答称：“奉瓦尔德命令，才抓姬的手，我未踢姬。而是希克尼推他了，也踢他了。”讯及希克尼时答称：“我推姬玉衡了，我现在很觉得对不住他”。继称：“我很不愿意瓦尔德对姬玉衡的态度与行为，这是一个用武力的暴行，他（指瓦尔德）是无权这样作的。”并称：“这是一种侵犯人权的行为”。凡此均可证明被告瓦尔德、希克尼、巽四郎三犯互相推卸犯罪责任，支吾搪塞，以致不能自圆其说。而且经证人张仲英、房品卿、岳善义在庭质言时述称：“瓦尔德用手抓姬玉衡的手，并用力推他。希克尼也抓住姬玉衡的手。两人连推带踢把姬玉衡推到楼梯门口。巽四郎上来，也抓住姬的手，三人将姬玉衡摔倒地上”。据此，依被告等之供词及其旁证人的在庭质证，足以证明瓦尔德、希克尼、巽四朗三犯于三经路三十八号殴打姬玉衡之犯罪行为全部真实。
    被告瓦尔德等于十一日九时二次聚众殴伤姬玉衡、姬玉峰致伤部分：被害人姬玉衡称：“雷贝格叫我上楼领钱，并强迫我签字时，我因钱不够，拒绝签字，雷就把我推倒在帐房外暖气包旁。我的弟弟姬玉峰上前排解，却被雷贝格推到穿堂门外将门锁闭。这时雷将瓦尔德唤出，雷贝格用右手抓着我右手，用左手推我。瓦尔德在后边连踢带打，把我从楼梯口推下来。正到楼梯转角处，姬玉峰又从楼梯下上来排解，雷贝格扔下我，痛击姬玉峰两拳后，将姬玉峰抱住。瓦尔德把我按倒在楼梯转角处的平地上。当时我头部撞在楼梯台阶上，撞破右额，瓦尔德又用拳打我的左眼，以后我就不省人事了”。对此，讯及瓦尔德等，虽仍百般狡赖，但雷贝格不得不承认“抱过姬玉峰”，克力斯坦承认“抓住姬玉峰的胳臂并打人”，瓦尔德一面承认以两手拉姬玉衡下楼，却又狡辩“姬玉衡的晕倒他（姬玉衡）自已坎下的”当质讯瓦尔德“你如何解释姬玉衡在你身旁受伤的问题”，瓦尔德则无言可对。但据工人孙恒利、于永宾等证称：“我看瓦尔德按住姬玉衡正打他，雷贝格楼住姬玉峰，克力斯坦从楼下上来用手拉住姬玉峰右手，并用左手打姬玉峰两个耳光，和在姬玉峰右肩头上打三拳”。查被害人姬玉衡被殴身受重伤，卧倒在地不省人事，除有现场摄影照片一张可证外，且经本院法医韩国魁勘验记载：症状系“前头部右侧长五米厘宽四米厘，非整形剥皮创伤一处，本人意志不明，小便失禁”，伤名系“脑震荡兼剥皮创伤”，并签驻诊断意见：“须急入医院就医，否则有生命危险”。该法医判定姬玉衡致伤原因：系“他伤以暴力殴打推撞”所致。姬玉衡被送医院急治后，据沈阳市立第一医院医师李建平诊断书记载：病名系“一、脑震荡二、头部右侧擦过伤三、两臂部及右下肢挫伤”。上述勘断及诊断书所载姬玉衡受伤状况与被害人及证人等之供述，和事实符合，证明被害人及证人所证瓦尔德等殴人致伤全属真实。因而瓦尔德等犯之犯罪行为业已构成。
    查瓦尔德等五犯，侨居中国领土内，无理解雇中国工人，克扣工人工资及休假金、解雇金、工资扣留金，并聚众行凶殴打中国工人姬玉衡、姬玉峰，构成伤害人身，侵犯人权罪行，违反我中华人民共和国之法令，应依法予以惩处。根据其罪行之轻重，判处行凶主犯瓦尔德徒刑六个月，从犯雷贝格、克力斯坦各处徒刑四个月，巽四郎、希克尼各处徒刑三个月，均各缓刑一年，驱逐出中国国境。被害人姬玉衡治伤医药费本币一百三十六万五千元，及因伤休养期间不能工作之损失费本币二百五十万元，均应由瓦尔德负担。并应付清姬玉衡应得之休假金、工资扣留金及解雇金等款。所判决如主文。
    本案经检察官莅庭执行职务。
