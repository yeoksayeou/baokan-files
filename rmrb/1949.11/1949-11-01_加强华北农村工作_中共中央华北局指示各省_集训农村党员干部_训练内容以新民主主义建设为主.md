  　to Conduct Intensive Training for Rural Party Member Cadres
    Training Content Focused on New Democracy Construction
    [North China News] In order to strengthen rural work, launch next year's large-scale production movement, build and consolidate North China, and actively participate in the construction of the new China, the CCP Central Committee North China Bureau has specifically instructed all provinces to conduct large-scale intensive training for rural Party member cadres this winter and spring.

    The instruction first stated: The rural Party member cadres in the North China region are heroic in their struggle against the enemy and loyal to the Party and the people. However, because they are mostly of peasant origin, often live in a decentralized small-scale production environment, have low levels of education, and have not received enough education from the Party, their ideological awareness is not high, and they lack a comprehensive and correct understanding of New Democracy construction and the future of the revolution. Therefore, they are satisfied with the equal distribution of land, mistakenly believing that the revolution has already succeeded. Some create disunity or relax their vigilance against enemy conspiracies and sabotage. Their work is sluggish, and they often make deviations in the implementation of policies. Regarding the content of the training, the instruction pointed out: Focus on New Democracy construction, supplemented by education on the future of the revolution and current affairs education. The New Democracy construction portion can account for three-fifths of the training time, and the other two portions each account for one-fifth. The training course should begin with education on the future of the revolution, briefly explaining the history of social development and its laws, so that students understand the principle that primitive society inevitably develops into socialist and communist society. They should understand that merely equally distributing land and overthrowing the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang cannot guarantee that the Chinese people will be freed from poverty. Only by developing production, completing the construction of New Democracy, and moving from New Democracy to socialism and communism can a permanently bright and happy future be opened up for all the people. Regarding New Democracy education, it should be explained that the main problem of New Democracy construction is to develop production, industrialize China, and collectivize agriculture, mainly taking the road of cooperatives on the basis of private individual economy. Agricultural socialism is erroneous and reactionary. Increase productivity, increase output, and enrich people's lives. It should be explained that in order to develop production and ensure the success of New Democracy production and construction, it is necessary to build the people's own state power. Now the Chinese people have established their own country for the first time in history—the People's Republic of China and the Central People's Government. Under this state power, the feudal system and the imperialist slavery system that have restricted the development of productive forces have been broken, and the people have the possibility to freely develop production according to the New Democracy policy. Therefore, we must love the new China of the people, and Communist Party members must become models of caring for the country and abiding by national laws. It should be explained that for New Democracy economic construction, it is also necessary to improve the cultural level and scientific knowledge of the masses. Communist Party members must have a working style of following the mass line and overcome bureaucracy and commandism in their work. Regarding current affairs education, we should explain the various conspiracies of the US-Chiang reactionaries, raise vigilance, and protect our production and construction. We should explain that the Soviet Union and the New Democratic countries are our close friends, and strengthen internationalist education.

    Regarding teaching methods, the instruction pointed out that lecturing and answering questions should be the main methods, paying attention to closely combining the ideological situation and struggle experience of the students, so that they dare to expose their thoughts, boldly doubt, carefully study, and enthusiastically argue, in order to truly clarify the problems, improve their thinking, and unite the entire Party and the entire people.

    The instruction pointed out that it should start from the end of the autumn harvest and end at the spring plowing next year. First, train the main Party member cadres of villages, including Party, government, and armed forces personnel. Individual non-Party cadres can also be absorbed to participate, and district cadres should be drawn in to participate and act as backbones in the study.

    Regarding the intensive training of rural Party member cadres in areas with severe disasters and new areas, the instruction said: If it is truly difficult for Party member cadres in disaster areas to participate, the county should make unified plans, and the county and district committees should go to the villages to cooperate in organizing production, carrying out production relief and current affairs education. New areas should focus on carrying out land reform. Party member cadres should be educated on land reform policies in conjunction with land reform, so that they understand the policy of "not moving in the middle, leveling at both ends," and understand the methods of class division and attitudes towards various classes.

　　加强华北农村工作
  　中共中央华北局指示各省
  　集训农村党员干部
    训练内容以新民主主义建设为主
    【华北消息】为加强农村工作，开展明年大生产运动，建设与巩固华北，积极地参加新中国的建设，中共中央华北局特指示各省于今冬明春，大量集训农村党员干部。
    该指示首称：华北区农村党员干部。对敌人斗争是英勇的，对党对人民是忠诚的。但由于他们多是农民出身，常处于分散的小生产的环境，文化水平低，受党的教育不够，思想觉悟还不高，对新民主主义建设及革命前途缺乏全面的正确的认识，因而满足于平分土地，误认为革命已经成功，有的闹不团结，或放松对敌阴谋破坏的警惕，工作疲塌，在执行政策上也常出偏差。关于训练内容，该指示指出：以新民主主义建设为主，辅之以革命前途教育与时事教育。新民主主义建设部分，可占训练时间的五分之三，其他两部分各占五分之一。训练课程应从革命前途教育开始，简略说明社会发展的历史及其规律，使学员懂得从原始社会必然发展到社会主义、共产主义社会的道理，使他们懂得仅仅平分土地，推翻国民党反动统治，还不能保证中国人民免除贫困，只有发展生产，完成新民主主义的建设，并由新民主主义走到社会主义、共产主义，才能为全体人民开辟永久光明幸福的前途。关于新民主主义教育，应说明新民主主义建设的主要问题是发展生产，使中国工业化，与农业集体化，主要是在私有的个体经济基础上走合作社的道路。而农业社会主义、是错误的反动的。使生产力提高，产量增加，使人民生活富裕。应说明为了发展生产，保证新民主主义生产建设的成功，必须建设人民自己的国家政权，现在中国人民在历史上第一次建立了自己的国家——中华人民共和国与中央人民政府，在这个国家政权之下，已经打破了束缚生产力发展的封建制度与帝国主义奴役制度，人民已有根据新民主主义政策自由发展生产的可能了，因之要热爱人民的新中国，共产党员要成为爱护国家与遵守国家法令的模范，应说明为了新民主主义经济建设，还要提高群众的文化水平与科学知识。共产党员必须要有走群众路线的工作作风，克服工作中的官僚主义与命令主义。关于时事教育，应说明美蒋反动派的各种阴谋，提高警惕，保护我们的生产建设。应说明苏联与新民主国家是我们亲密的朋友，加强国际主义教育。
    关于教学方法，该指示指出以讲授与解答问题为主，注意密切结合学员思想情况与斗争经验，使他们敢于暴露思想，大胆怀疑，认真研究，热烈争论，达到真正弄清问题，提高思想，团结全党全体人民的目的。
    该指示指出：应从秋收结束开始，至明年春耕时止。首先训练村的党、政、武装等主要党员干部。个别非党干部亦可吸收参加，并抽区干部参加，在学习中作骨干。
    对于灾情严重地区和新区的农村党员干部的集训问题，指示中说：如灾区党员干部参加确有困难，则应由县统一计划，由县、区委到村配合组织生产，进行生产救灾与时事教育。新区以进行土改为主，对党员干部应结合土改，进行土改政策的教育，使其懂得中间不动两头平的政策。懂得划阶级的方法及对各阶层的态度。
