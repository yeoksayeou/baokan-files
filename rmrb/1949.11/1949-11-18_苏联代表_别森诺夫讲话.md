　　Speech by
  　Soviet Representative Bessonov
    Dear Comrades!

    Allow me, on behalf of the laborers of the Central Asian Republics of the Soviet Union, to extend warm fraternal greetings to the representatives of the conference and the heroic Chinese people.

    Comrades! Comrade Saillant, the Secretary-General of the World Federation of Trade Unions, has given a detailed account in his report of the activities of the World Federation of Trade Unions in helping the trade unions of Asian countries.

    Without a doubt, the World Federation of Trade Unions, from its very beginning, has stood up to defend the vital interests of the laborers of Asian countries.

    As everyone knows, the World Federation of Trade Unions has protested against the persecution in India, Japan, Iran, Lebanon, Malaya, Burma, and other countries of democratic trade unions and their leaders, and has won the right to defend the rights and freedoms of trade unions in the United Nations Economic and Social Council.

    The World Federation of Trade Unions has raised vital and important issues for the laborers of most Asian countries to the United Nations, such as guaranteeing employment for all and striving to eliminate unemployment, and stipulating equal pay for equal work for men and women, white and colored people, adults and young workers.

    The reactionaries of Britain, France, and the Netherlands, headed by U.S. imperialism, continue to wage bloody wars against the laborers of Indonesia, Vietnam, Burma, Malaya, and South Korea, who are fighting for their freedom and true national independence.

    War brings countless disasters not only to the laborers of these countries but also to the laborers of the Netherlands, France, Britain, the United States, and other countries, because the ever-increasing military expenditures place a heavy burden on the laborers' shoulders.

    The World Federation of Trade Unions opposes the wars of plunder being waged in Indonesia, Vietnam, Burma, and Malaya, and mobilizes the laborers of all countries to support the people of these countries.

    The Soviet trade union delegation believes that the representative meeting will unanimously commend the World Federation of Trade Unions for its actions in defending trade union rights and the socio-economic interests of the laboring people of Asian countries, as well as the firm support given by the Federation to the oppressed people of Asian countries who are defending freedom and independence.

    The Second Congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions, held in Milan, Italy, in June and July 1949, reaffirmed in its resolution on the activities of trade unions in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Australia, some of the principles underlying the activities of the World Federation of Trade Unions in colonial, semi-colonial, and economically backward countries.

    These principles are: to terminate the colonial protectorate and the system of dependent territories regarded as areas of economic exploitation; to help the people of these countries realize their right to self-determination and achieve complete national independence; to develop trade union organizations in these countries without discrimination based on race, color, nationality, or belief; and to establish labor laws that guarantee the protection of the interests of the laboring people and their effective participation in the formulation and implementation of the economic policies of their respective countries.

    The Soviet delegation is convinced that the Asian Trade Union Representative Conference will approve and support these principles, which are based on the urgent demands of the laboring people of oppressed countries.

    From the reports and speeches of the representatives, we are convinced that the World Federation of Trade Unions has done a great deal of work in practically helping the trade unions of Asian countries. However, the tasks of trade union organizations in these countries have increased significantly, and it is therefore natural to demand that the leading organs of the World Federation of Trade Unions give special attention to the necessity of taking more effective measures to help the trade unions of Asian countries.

    As such, the Soviet delegation suggests that industrial trade unions in Asian countries should be more widely involved in the International Trade Secretariats (the production departments of the World Federation of Trade Unions); that the World Federation of Trade Unions should organize the printing of various materials of the World Federation of Trade Unions in the languages of Asian countries; that the World Federation of Trade Unions should send committees to India, Japan, Iran, and South Korea to study the situation of trade unions and help them on the spot; and that the United Economic and Social Council should be proposed to study the issue of restoring democratic freedoms and eliminating slave labor in India, Iran, Japan, Indonesia, Burma, Malaya, and South Korea, eliminating anti-labor laws, and giving different treatment based on skin color, ethnicity, gender, and religious belief.

    Frequent and close contact between the general trade unions and departmental trade union organizations in Asian countries, as well as between them and the World Federation of Trade Unions, is a necessary condition for the success of all their activities. Taking this into consideration, the Soviet delegation decided to support the proposal to establish a liaison bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions in Asia. The liaison bureau should engage in strengthening the ties between the trade unions of Asian countries and the World Federation of Trade Unions, ensuring mutual exchange of information, implementing the resolutions of the leading organs of the World Federation of Trade Unions, and helping the trade unions of Asian countries.

    The Soviet delegation is convinced that the World Federation of Trade Unions and all national trade unions participating in the World Federation of Trade Unions will more actively carry out their activities in uniting the strength of the working class and all laboring people in the struggle for peace, freedom, and the democratic rights of the people, in the struggle to improve their economic and social status!

    The trade unions of the Central Asian Republics, like all the trade unions of the Soviet Union, will continue to do their utmost to enhance friendly ties with the trade unions of foreign countries, and together with them, will actively struggle for the international solidarity of the working class and the further unity and consolidation of the strength of the great camp of peace and democracy, against the instigators of a new war by imperialism, for the vital interests of the laboring people, for democracy, and for lasting peace throughout the world.

    Long live the great international solidarity of the laboring people!

    Long live the World Federation of Trade Unions!

　　苏联代表
  　别森诺夫讲话
    【新华社北京十七日电】苏联代表别森诺夫在亚澳工会会议上的讲话全文如下：亲爱的同志们！
    让我代表苏联中亚细亚各共和国的劳动者，向代表会议的代表和英勇的中国人民致热烈的兄弟敬礼。
    同志们！世界工联总书记赛扬同志在他的报告里已详细地述说了世界工联帮助亚洲各国职工会的活动。
    毫无疑义地，世界工联从其存在的初期，便起来保卫亚洲各国劳动者的切身利益。
    大家知道，世界工联抗议在印度、日本、伊朗、黎巴嫩、马来亚、缅甸及其他国家内对民主职工会和其领袖们的迫害，争得了在联合国经济及社会理事会中来捍卫职工会的权利与自由。
    世界工联向联合国提出了亚洲大多数国家的劳动者切身的重要问题，例如，保证全体有工作，并争取消灭失业，规定男女、白色人和有色人种、成人和青年工人的同工同酬。
    以美帝国主义为首的英国、法国及荷兰的反动派，继续在进行反对为争取自己的自由和真正的民族独立而斗争着的印尼、越南、缅甸、马来亚、南朝鲜劳动者的流血战争。
    战争不仅给这些国家的劳动者，而且也给荷、法、英、美等国的劳动者带来无数的灾难，因为日益增长的军费，给劳动者们的肩上加重了负担。
    世界工联反对在印尼、越南、缅甸和马来亚等国内所进行的掠夺战争，并动员各国劳动者支持这些国家的人民。
    苏联工会代表团相信，代表会议将一致嘉奖世界工联捍卫工会权利和亚洲各国劳动人民社会经济利益的一些行动，以及工联对捍卫自由与独立的亚洲各国被压迫人民所给予的坚决支持。
    一九四九年六、七月间在意大利米兰所举行的世界工联第二次代表大会，在关于亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和澳洲各国职工会活动报告的决议中，再一次证实了世界工联在殖民地、半殖民地及经济落后国家内活动基础的一些原则。
    这些原则是在于：终止殖民地保护制及视作经济剥削范围的附属领土制度；帮助这些国家的人民实现其自决权及达到完全的民族独立、发展这些国家的不问种族、肤色、民族与信仰等差别的职工会组织，以及确立保证维护劳动人民利益的劳工法令及他们有效的参加制订和实行各该国的经济政策。
    苏联代表团确信：亚洲各国职工代表会议将赞成和拥护这些基于被压迫各国劳动者底迫切要求所规定出来的原则。
    从代表们的报告和演说中，我们确信世界工联在实际帮助亚洲各国职工会方面，曾作了很多工作。然而这些国家工会组织的任务是显著地增大了，因此，很自然地要要求世界工联的领导机关对采取更有效的措施来帮助亚洲各国工会的必要性给予特别的重视。
    如此，苏联代表团建议更广泛地吸收亚洲各国产业工会参加国际产业联合（世界工联的生产部）；组织以亚洲各国文字印行世界工联的各种材料；世界工联派遣委员会到印度、日本、伊朗及南朝鲜去研究职工会的情况并就地帮助他们；提议联合经济及社会理事会研究关于在印度、伊朗、日本、印尼、缅甸、马来亚及南朝鲜必须恢复民主自由及消灭奴役劳动，消灭反劳工法及按肤色、民族、性别与宗教信仰而给与不同待遇问题。
    亚洲各国的总工会与各部门工会组织之间，以及它们与世界工联之间的经常而密切的联系，是它们全部活动取得成功的必要条件。苏联代表团考虑到这点，决定支持关于在亚洲建立世界工联联络局的提议。联络局应该从事加强亚洲各国工会与世界工联之间的联系，保证相互交换情报，执行世界工联领导机关的决议并帮助亚洲各国工会。
    苏联代表团确信：世界工联及一切参加世界工联的各国工会在团结工人阶级及一切劳动人民的力量从事争取和平、自由及人民民主权利的斗争中，在改善他们的经济及社会地位的斗争中将会更加积极地开展自己的活动！
    中亚各共和国的职工会，象所有苏联的职工会一样，今后也将尽全力来增进同国外各国职工会之间的友谊联系，并同它们一道，为工人阶级底国际团结及进一步团结和巩固伟大的和平民主阵营的力量，反对帝国主义的新战争的煽动者，为劳动人民的切身利益，为民主，为全世界持久和平而进行积极的斗争。
    劳动人民的国际大团结万岁！
    世界工联万岁！
