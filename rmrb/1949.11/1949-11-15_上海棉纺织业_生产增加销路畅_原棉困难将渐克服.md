Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, November 14th: Shanghai's largest industrial public-private cotton textile industry is now beginning to improve. This industry encountered various difficulties such as a lack of raw cotton, insufficient power, and sluggish sales in the initial stages of the imperialist and Kuomintang remnant bandit gang's blockade. Over the past four months, thanks to the planned support of the People's Government and the cotton textile industry's self-reliance and hard work, the above-mentioned difficulties have been gradually overcome, and it has begun to move from resuming production to initially increasing production. Although the supply of raw cotton to Shanghai's cotton textile industry will still have a certain degree of difficulty in the future, these difficulties can be gradually overcome. At present, the industry has begun to embark on a steady upward path.

The state-owned China Textile Construction Corporation's seventeen cotton textile factories in Shanghai have, since October 24th, increased their operating hours from three days and five nights per week to four days and six nights per week. Half of these factories have also launched production labor competitions and achieved initial results. In June, the seventeen factories of China Textile operated for five days and five nights per week. In July, to take into account the difficulty of raw material supply, operating hours were reduced to four days and four nights per week. From August 22nd, due to insufficient power supply, it was changed to three days and five nights per week. Although operating hours remained at three days and five nights per week in September, the production situation gradually improved. At the same time, in order to adapt to the domestic raw cotton supply situation and the new economic situation, China Textile has greatly increased the use of domestic cotton, gradually reducing the 387,000 spindles originally used to spin yarn of 32 counts or higher to 100,000 spindles, while the remaining 287,000 spindles were converted to spin coarser yarn of 20 counts and below. In addition, China Textile has also appropriately reduced the output of export cloth and fancy cloth, and increased the production of 12-pound fine cloth and serge, which are needed by the Chinese people. This change in production policy has greatly promoted the improvement of China Textile's production situation. According to September statistics, the output of various departments of China Textile, compared with May before the liberation of Shanghai, increased by 45% for cotton yarn, 58% for cotton cloth, 76% for processed cloth, 90% for wool yarn, 260% for麻袋 sacks, 145% for silk, and 92% for silk fabrics. In terms of product sales, in October alone, the trade corporations of Central China, North China, Northwest China, Northeast China and other regions purchased 2,944 pieces of cotton yarn and more than 740,000 pieces of cotton cloth from China Textile. Recently, due to the continuous expansion of the liberated areas and the increasing breadth of the domestic market, the products of China Textile factories have become increasingly popular. This situation not only shows that China Textile has completely broken away from its long-term dependence on imperialism in the past, and initially overcome the blockade of the Kuomintang remnant bandits, but also shows that the policy of self-reliance called for by the East China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Shanghai Municipal Committee on July 27th is completely correct.

The production situation of Shanghai's 55 private yarn factories has also improved significantly. Since October, the operating rate of each factory has increased from three days and three nights per week to four days and four nights. Since October 18th, yarn factories such as Shenxin No. 9 Factory, Rongfeng, and Tongyi have increased their operating hours to four days and six nights per week. The number of spindles operating in private yarn factories throughout the city has increased from the lowest level of 1,020,000 in August to 1,125,000, accounting for 89% of the total of 1,400,000 operable spindles. When Shanghai was first liberated, these private yarn factories had an average cotton stock sufficient for only 25 days, and some yarn factories were even shut down due to a lack of raw cotton. The factories operated for an average of four days and three nights per week in July and August. In early September, due to insufficient power supply, it was reduced to three days and three nights per week. Coupled with the shortage of raw cotton and the stagnation of sales, an abnormal phenomenon of expensive cotton and cheap yarn once formed, and private yarn factories felt it difficult to maintain. In order to correctly implement the policy of giving consideration to both public and private interests, the People's Government vigorously promoted urban-rural relations and facilitated the exchange of goods, while at the same time urgently allocated 50,000 dan of raw cotton to private yarn factories in July and August to maintain production. These correct measures of the People's Government, as well as the continuous supply of raw cotton from North China, Central China, Northwest China, Northeast China and other regions to Shanghai for support, are powerful factors for Shanghai's public and private cotton textile industry to overcome difficulties and gradually recover and develop.

### 上海棉纺织业  生产增加销路畅  原棉困难将渐克服

    上海棉纺织业
    生产增加销路畅
    原棉困难将渐克服
    【新华社上海十四日电】上海最大的工业公私营棉纺织业，现在开始好转。这个工业在帝国主义和国民党残余匪帮施行封锁初期，曾经遇到原棉缺乏、动力不足、销路不畅等种种困难。最近四个月来，由于人民政府有计划地扶助和棉纺织业自力更生、艰苦奋斗的结果，已经逐步克服上述各种困难，由恢复生产开始走向初步增加生产。虽然今后上海棉纺织业的原棉供应还有一定程度的困难，但这些困难是可以逐步克服的，目前该业已开始走上了稳步上升的途程。
    国营中国纺织建设公司在沪的十七个棉纺织工厂，自十月廿四日起，已从每周开工三日五夜提高到每周四日六夜。其中半数工厂且已展开生产劳动竞赛，并取得初步成绩。在六月份内，中纺十七个厂每周开工为五日五夜。七月份为顾及原料供应困难，每周开工减至四日四夜。八月二十二日起，因电力供应不足，又改为每周开工三日五夜。九月份每周虽仍开工三日五夜，但生产情况已逐步好转。同时，中纺为适应国内原棉供应状况和新的经济情势，大量采用国棉，把原来纺三十二支以上细纱的三十八万七千余枚纱锭，逐步减为十万锭子，其余二十八万七千余枚纱锭，则改纺廿支及廿支以下的粗纱。此外，中纺又适当地减少外销布、花色布的产量，多织十二磅细匹布和纱哔叽等中国人民大众所需要的货品。这一生产方针的改变，大大促成了中纺生产情况的好转。据九月份统计，中纺各部门的产量，如与上海解放前的五月份比较，计棉纱增加百分之四十五，棉布增加百分之五十八，加工布增加百分之七十六，毛纱增加百分之九十，麻袋增加百分之二百六十，绢丝增加百分之一百四十五，丝织品增加百分之九十二。在产品的销路方面，十月份内仅华中、华北、西北、东北等各地贸易总公司，就向中纺购买棉纱二千九百四十四件，棉布七十四万余匹。最近由于解放地区不断扩大，国内市场日益宽广，中纺各厂的产品愈见畅销。这种情况，不独说明中纺已经完全摆脱了过去对于帝国主义的长期依赖，以及初步战胜了国民党残余匪帮的封锁，并且也说明了中共中央华东局和上海市委于七月二十七日号召自力更生这一方针的完全正确。
    上海全市五十五家私营纱厂的生产情况，目前也有显著的好转，十月份起，各厂开工率，已自每周三日三夜增至四日四夜。自十月十八日起，申新第九厂、荣丰、统益等纱厂并增至每周四日六夜。全市私营纱厂运转的纱锭，已自八月份最低时的一百零二万枚，增至一百十二万五千锭，占全部可运转的一百四十万枚纱锭的百分之八十九。这些私营纱厂在上海刚解放时，平均存棉只够廿五天之用，一部分纱厂且因原棉缺乏而陷于停顿。各厂在七、八月间，平均每周开工四日三夜。九月初又因电力不足，减至每周三日三夜。加以原棉缺乏，销路停滞，一度形成花贵纱贱的反常现象，私营纱厂深感难于维持。人民政府为正确执行公私兼顾的方针，一面大力沟通城乡关系，便利物资交流，一面又在七、八两月份内以五万担原棉紧急配给私营纱厂，以维持生产。人民政府的这些正确措施，以及华北、华中、西北、东北各地源源输送原棉来沪支援，是上海公私营棉纺工业克服困难，逐步恢复和发展的有力因素。
