Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 15th:
　　中華全國總工会名誉主席 Liu Shaoqi, Honorary Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, delivered a welcoming speech today at the welcoming meeting for the members of the Executive Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions. The full text is as follows:
    Dear Comrade Louis Saillant!
    Comrades, members of the Executive Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions!
    Representatives of trade unions from various countries!
    Today you have arrived in Beijing, the capital of the People's Republic of China. On behalf of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the workers and staff of the capital, I extend a warm welcome to you! We Chinese working class feel extremely honored and excited that the meeting of the Executive Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions and the Asian and Australian Trade Union Conference can be held in the capital of China. Because the Chinese working class has been under the long-term oppression of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, we have not seen our class brothers from all over the world for a long time. Although we have carried out a long-term struggle in various different countries of the world for a common goal and against a common enemy, since the delegation of progressive trade unions from various countries of the world first came to China in 1926-27, they have not come to China again for more than 20 years. Today, thanks to the victory of the Chinese People's Great Revolution, the Executive Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions, as the center of unity of the world's working class, has once again come to China to meet, and will hold the Asian and Australian Trade Union Conference here. This will enable the Chinese working class to freely unite with the working classes of all countries in the world and carry out a joint struggle. The joy and excitement of the Chinese workers is beyond description. In order to defend world peace, oppose warmongers, liberate the oppressed nations of Asia, oppose imperialist aggression, and defend the rights of the working class and oppose capital's attack, the international solidarity and common struggle of the working classes of all countries in the world are absolutely necessary. I wish the meeting of the Executive Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions and the Asian and Australian Trade Union Conference success! I wish all members and representatives good health!

　　刘少奇致欢迎词
    【新华社北京十五日电】中华全国总工会名誉主席刘少奇今日在欢迎世界工联执行局各委员的欢迎会上致欢迎词，全文如下：
    亲爱的路易·赛扬同志！
    世界工会联合会执行局各委员同志们！
    各国工会的代表们！　
    今天你们已经来到中华人民共和国的首都北京，我代表中华全国总工会和首都的工人和职员们热烈地欢迎你们！这次世界工联执行局的会议和亚洲、澳洲工会会议能在中国的首都召开，使我们中国的工人阶级感到极大的荣幸和兴奋。因为中国的工人阶级在帝国主义和国民党反动派的长期压迫之下，很久没有看到世界各国的阶级兄弟了，虽然我们在世界各个不同的国家内为了共同的目标、向着共同的敌人进行了长期的斗争，但世界各国进步工会的代表团从一九二六——二七年第一次来过中国以后，二十多年来再没有来过中国。今天，由于中国人民大革命的胜利，作为世界工人阶级团结的中心——世界工联执行局才又再来到中国集会，并将在此召开亚洲、澳洲工会会议，这将使中国工人阶级能够自由地和世界各国的工人阶级团结一致，进行共同的斗争，中国工人们的欢欣鼓舞，是难以形容的。为了保卫世界和平，反对战争贩子，为了亚洲各国被压迫民族的解放，反对帝国主义的侵略，为了保卫工人阶级的权利，反对资本进攻，世界各国工人阶级的国际团结与共同斗争，是完全必要的。敬祝世界工联执行局的会议及亚洲、澳洲工会会议成功！敬祝各位委员及各位代表健康！（附图片）
