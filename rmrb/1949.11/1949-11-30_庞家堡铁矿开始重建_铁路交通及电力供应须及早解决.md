【Benbao Jing-Sui Railway Line, 27th Dispatch】 Reporter Li Yi reports: The Pangjiabao mine of the Xuanhua Longyan Iron Mine, which contains reserves of 200 million tons with an iron content of 62%, is currently undergoing vigorous restoration and reconstruction. More than 3,000 horsepower of various electric motors used for mining and transportation power began to be repaired on the 15th of this month and are expected to be completed in April next year. The small repair shop established by the mine has taken initial shape and will begin repairing mine cars, winches and other machinery at the beginning of next month. Electrical workers have converted more than 20 kilometers of 77,000-volt high-voltage transmission lines into 33,000-volt transmission lines. In addition, the 4,000-meter-long 3,300-volt transmission line and ordinary lighting line for the mine were successfully completed in early this month. About 3,500 square meters of houses and seven collapsed mine tunnels are being repaired and renovated. By the end of this year, the number of workers will increase from the current 170 to 500. According to the established plan, it is expected that 1,000 tons of high-quality iron sand can be produced daily by September next year. At present, there are two issues that urgently need to be resolved in the mine: one is the railway transportation issue. The 43-kilometer railway branch line between the mine and Xuanhua Station on the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway urgently needs to be repaired. The second is the power supply issue. The factory's 77,000-volt substation needs to be rebuilt as soon as possible.
