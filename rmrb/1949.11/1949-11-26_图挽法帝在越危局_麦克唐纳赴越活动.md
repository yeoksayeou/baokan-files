Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 25th. In an attempt to salvage the French Imperialists' crisis in Vietnam, British High Commissioner for Southeast Asia, MacDonald, went to Saigon, Vietnam this month on the 14th. After staying in the French-occupied areas of Vietnam for eight days, he returned to Singapore on the 23rd. Accompanying MacDonald were several political advisors. During his stay in Vietnam, MacDonald held multiple talks with French High Commissioner to Vietnam, Pignon; Commander-in-Chief of the French forces in Vietnam, Carpentier; Commander of the French forces in Tonkin (Northern Vietnam), Alessandri; and Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Van Xuan and Foreign Minister Nguyen Van Long of the French puppet Bao Dai government; he also went with Pignon to Tra Do to "tour Vietnam," meet with Bao Dai, and deliver a personal letter from Bevin to Bao Dai. The diplomatic correspondent for the British Communist Party's newspaper, the Daily Worker, pointed out in a report on this matter that MacDonald's visit to Vietnam was "prompted by the dire situation the French are now in themselves." The British and American governments both believe that "Vietnam, located on the Chinese border, is key to continuing the suppression of the Southeast Asian national liberation movement." MacDonald's trip to Vietnam is undoubtedly an attempt to see "what more can be done to restore France's fortune."

  　麦克唐纳赴越活动
    【新华社北京二十五日电】英国驻东南亚高级专员麦克唐纳，曾于本月十四日赴越南之西贡，在越南法国侵占区逗留八天之后，已于二十三日返回新加坡。随麦克唐纳同往者尚有政治顾问多人。麦克唐纳在逗留越南期间，曾先后与法国驻越南高级专员皮农、驻越法军总司令加尔庞吉埃、驻东京（越南北部）法军司令亚历山大及法国傀儡保大政府副总理阮文春、外长阮文龙等举行多次会谈；并与皮农同赴茶叨，“巡游越南”，会见保大，并转递贝文致保大的私人信件。英共机关报工人日报外交记者在报道此事时指出，麦克唐纳的访问越南，是“由于法国人自己现在陷入的凶恶形势所促成。”英美两国政府都认为，“位于中国边境的越南，是继续镇压东南亚民族解放运动的关键”。麦克唐纳之赴越南，无疑地是企图看看“还能作些什么，以恢复法国的幸运”。
