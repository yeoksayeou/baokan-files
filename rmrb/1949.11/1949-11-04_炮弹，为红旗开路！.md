　　Shells, Clearing the Way for the Red Flag!
　　Cheng Yu
　　One. Cumbersome? Cumbersome?
　　During the battle of Lanzhou, our artillery contributed greatly. In the unit attacking Doujia Mountain, from commanders to combatants, everyone on the battlefield personally witnessed each shell flying and exploding, cheering with joy. Afterwards, their battle summary also mentioned: "According to the Third Company, First Battalion, 566th Regiment (assault company), our artillery always fired in front of the red flag, which smoothly sent us to the breakthrough point."
　　But I was always busy interviewing the infantry and never had a chance to visit the artillery. Now that we are advancing towards Ningxia, I will follow them.
　　I first arrived at the mountain artillery battalion. The artillerymen were busy preparing for tomorrow's departure. It was September 6th afternoon, and there were at least twelve hours before the departure time tomorrow, but the gunners were unloading the cannons, disassembling them, wiping the parts, repairing the saddles, tidying up the toolboxes, cleaning the bedding equipment, and pulling out the livestock to carry the cannons for marching tests, to check whether there were any defects in the weight and the combination of equipment; all of these were necessary work before a long march, which generally took three to four hours to complete. If we add the preparation of personal rations, bedding, and personal belongings, it often took half a day. They were busy from after dinner until dark before finishing this part of the work. The political commissar of the artillery regiment, Zeng, humbly introduced to me: The characteristics of our artillery are "cumbersome," "luō＠①suo" [cumbersome], and "dispersed," especially "troublesome" during marching. At first glance, these seem to be the first characteristics to be noticed.
　　I continued to pay attention to this characteristic:
　　We set off at eight o'clock the next morning, but the artillerymen got up at five o'clock. The drivers were busy watering the horses, unloading the stakes, and tying the troughs (canvas troughs, used during marching on the pack saddles), and putting on the saddles. The gunners then disassembled the mountain cannons and, according to yesterday's preparations, put each part on the pack saddles separately, disguised them, and then started to move. Last time when we advanced to Lanzhou, we marched on a wide and flat light blue highway. The mountain cannons could be towed forward, and the gun carriages did not need to be disassembled and carried. Two large mules could pull them quickly. But this time it was different. After only walking a dozen miles on the road northeast of Lanzhou, we suddenly turned sharply north and entered a narrow, winding, uneven gully, walking higher and higher, steeper and steeper. When we reached the top of the mountain, we were already more than twenty miles away from the entrance of the gully, but there were even higher mountain tops above. From this mountain top to that mountain top, every step was up and down, with no flat ground. Rain and fog filled the mountain tops, and the small roads were muddy and steep. The mules carrying the cannons became more and more difficult to walk because each mountain cannon was distributed among six mules, and each mule carried an average of more than two hundred and fifty pounds. Every time we went uphill, a cautious command came from the front: "Tighten the front straps, loosen the back straps!" The animals slowly stopped, and the drivers hurriedly tightened the leather straps on the animals' chests and loosened the straps behind their tails. As they moved, the distance between the animals gradually increased. When going downhill, the command immediately came: "Tighten the back straps, loosen the front straps!" The drivers were busy again. In this way, the distance between the animals became longer and longer, and the speed of marching became slower and slower. People walked scattered in the middle. After noon, the mountain artillery battalion and the regiment headquarters stopped in the village at the foot of the mountain for a little over an hour. The heavy mortar battalion behind had not yet caught up, and here we started to move again. Afterwards, during rest periods of more than twenty minutes, the cannons were first unloaded from the animals to allow them to rest before the people could rest. When moving forward, they were re-mounted on the animals, which delayed another ten minutes. When approaching the campsite, the distance between even two companies was more than half a kilometer. Their marching speed was almost half that of the infantry.
　　When they arrived at the campsite, the artillerymen could not enter the houses first. The gunners did not even put down their backpacks. First, they unloaded and disassembled the cannons. They opened the toolboxes and wiped the parts of the cannons one by one. Some places that were damp and rusty had to be carefully wiped with kerosene. The breechblock (which seemed to be equivalent to a gun bolt) took a relatively long time, requiring half an hour each time for wiping and assembly. In addition, some repaired the gun carriages and pack saddles. After all the parts were wiped, they were combined to form a complete cannon, lined up in the square in front of the door, and covered with dark green canvas. After the gunners unloaded the cannons, they immediately pulled the livestock to the open space to slowly graze; when the daily journey was within sixty *li*, they grazed for at least one and a half hours, and when they traveled seventy or eighty *li*, they had to graze for two hours. In addition, they had to bury the horse stakes, tie the horse troughs, and collect forage until dusk, when they could take off the last layer of water covers from the horses' backs before they could rest. Geng Ming, the instructor of the first company, said: Artillerymen must be busy for three hours after arriving at the campsite before they can rest. If they encounter particularly difficult situations, it is even impossible to predict. They developed feelings for the cannons and livestock, and became accustomed to this kind of life.
　　For three days, I saw this busy and hard life every day. I couldn't find a suitable opportunity to talk to them. All I came into contact with were these things that were "cumbersome" and "luō＠①suo" [cumbersome]. Can this help me understand our artillery? I want to find out the basic characteristics of the artillery – how did they contribute in Lanzhou?
　　Two. In Front of the Nimble Troops
　　On the fourth day, we set off again, still walking along the top of the mountain. The top of the mountain was shrouded in clouds and fog, sometimes drizzling, sometimes turning into thick fog. At noon, the sun gradually emerged, and the road on the top of the mountain became smoother. When the vanguard saw the plain ahead, they cheered and clamored. Some shouted loudly: "It's so bright! These few days have stifled me!" Some said: "Let's go to the plain to buy watermelons!" The troops gradually quickened their pace, and the distance between the ranks gradually shortened. At this time, I joined the ranks of the third company and chatted with them. The company commander introduced me to an old gunner in his forties with a full beard. He was squad leader Zhang Weixin from Dunhuang, Gansu. He had been in the artillery of Fu Zuoyi's 35th Army for more than ten years, from driver to gun carriage commander. He was liberated during the Battle of Xinbaoan in Chahar last year and made a contribution in the Lanzhou Campaign. I wanted to talk to him about the situation in the battle of Lanzhou. He spoke slowly and quietly, and was very restrained and humble, unwilling to mention his own merits. Others said that he played a big role in the battle, but he always said: "It was nothing." After asking him for a long time, he only said: "The position must be leveled, and the two wheels must be placed flat for stability. The screws on the cannon must be tightened beforehand so that they will not vibrate during transfer and firing. If there is vibration, it will be small, and it will be easier to aim."
　　Later, I also talked to their platoon leader and the soldiers in his squad. Everyone was very clear about his role.
　　　　　×　　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　　×
　　In the Lanzhou Campaign, the fourth cannon (belonging to the seventh squad) was the best-firing cannon. After marching continuously for more than ten days, it was not easy to catch up with the enemy in Lanzhou, and no one could hold back. The troops immediately switched from marching order to combat order, first opening fire on the enemy positions near Shili Mountain. At that time, the first and second cannons were in front, and the fourth cannon was about two *li* behind. When approaching Shili Mountain, enemy shells hit one after another, and two or three *zhang* high dust and black smoke suddenly rose from the ground, scaring the mules and causing them to run around. The drivers held on to the reins and were dragged all over the ground by the animals, but they did not let go. Finally, they managed to lead the animals to a place three hundred meters away from the position before stopping. Squad leader Zhang Weixin took off his upper body clothes, stripped to the waist, and dug the position himself first. He said: "I'll dig it myself first. When it's dug deep enough to block two people, then you can come up." When it was dug deeper, he only called two or three people up. If others wanted to come up, he would be anxious: "No, too many people will be too exposed, and it's easy to dig the position too big, with too much soil coming out, wasting time, and it will be bad." So others only took care of carrying the soil. They dug and "combined" at the same time. As a result, it was faster than the other squads who arrived earlier (other squads dug first and then moved and combined, which was much slower).
　　The command post sent an order by telephone: Open fire on the enemy's machine gun positions on the front of Shili Mountain. At the fourth cannon position, Zhang Weixin personally aimed. He set the distance at 2,200 meters. From the gun sight, he could see the arc-shaped small mound on the enemy's position. He aligned this target with the crosshairs on the lens and immediately told the second gunner to pull the firing pin. The first shell hit, and smoke immediately rose from the mound. Then he fired eight shells in one go. Thick smoke mixed with yellow earth debris soared into the air, like a brown wall, and the arc-shaped small mound disappeared. At this time, the command post sent another phone call: "All hits, transfer the position!" They then took advantage of the night to transfer south. When they arrived, it was already dawn. Here, they were only a little over a thousand meters away from the enemy. The enemy's light and heavy machine guns fired at them in unison, and bullets whizzed around them. They left only three people on their position, opened fire and hit, and then fired seventeen more shells. The machine gun positions stopped firing.
　　On the eve of the general attack on Doujia Mountain, it was drizzling. The artillerymen walked on the muddy mountain roads to the designated position, and built concealed fortifications in the dark of night, digging while feeling with their hands. After the fortifications were completed, the depth and width of the fortifications were completely suitable. At dawn, the order came to first fire at the small bunker below the No. 1 position of Doujia Mountain to cover the assault troops' charge. At this time, Zhang Weixin set the fourth cannon to a distance of 1,900 meters. After only three shots, they saw the assault team's red flag immediately planted next to the small bunker, waving in the wind in the smoke. The phone immediately called for extended firing, targeting the largest bunker on the No. 1 position. This time, they set the distance to 2,100 meters and hit with the first shot. He personally saw the heroic infantrymen charging towards the large bunker. Then, he fired more than twenty shells, and the infantry advanced to the front of the large bunker. The red flag was erected high on the hilltop. But there were still enemies in the village on the left, charging back towards the red flag. The red flag was taken down for a while, and then planted again for a while. Dust filled the mountain, and machine guns chattered like popping beans. He set the distance to 2,500 meters and fired more than a dozen shells at the village. At this time, the smoke obscured everything, and only sparse gunfire could be heard. After a while, they saw the red flag planted in front of the village.
　　The heroes of the assault team continued to advance. After the red flag was planted on the No. 2 position, they also saw the power of the second cannon of the Second Company. Platoon leader Cao Yunlong personally corrected the aiming. He used forty-four shells, step by step, to lead the red flag to the front of the No. 4 position. The enemy counterattacked twice, and our shells always flew and exploded in front of the red flag. They saw the red flag suddenly withdrawn, but after a while, it was waving further ahead. At this time, behind the No. 4 position, the enemy's cannons were being dismantled, and two people were carrying them down piece by piece! The infantry also ran straight back, carrying machine guns on their backs. In the afternoon, we occupied the No. 4 position. The artillery immediately transferred to the No. 1 position, preparing to cover the troops in capturing the No. 5 position. By the time the artillerymen moved to the top of the five-*li*-high mountain and built the fortifications, all the large and small positions of Doujia Mountain had been covered with victorious red flags. At this time, the enemy not only retreated from Doujia Mountain, but also dared not occupy Lanzhou anymore.
　　On this day of the advance, the soldiers were very happy because the weather was clear, they had entered the plain, and they were walking on a flat road again. I was even more happy. I not only had the same three reasons as above, but also, today, in everyone's joy, I visited two companies and talked very well with several heroes, further getting in touch with the basic characteristics of the artillery: Although the artillery is "cumbersome" and "luō＠①suo" [cumbersome], its role is in front of the nimble troops!
　　Later, I also met the political commissar. He talked to me a lot about the artillery, and did not mention cumbersome and luō＠①suo again. Finally, he only said one sentence: "I hope we can fight a few battles after we get to Ningxia!..."

　　炮弹，为红旗开路！
    程予
  　一　笨重？＠嗦？
    打兰州的时候，我们的炮兵功劳不小。在主攻窦家山的部队里，从指挥员到战斗员都曾在战场上亲眼看到每一发炮弹的飞炸而欢声叫好。事后，他们的战斗总结上也提到：“据五六六团一营三连（突击连）反映：咱们的大炮，老在红旗前面打，就这样顺利的把我们送到突破点上去。”
    可是我总忙于步兵的采访，始终没有到炮兵里去过一趟。现在开始向宁夏进军了，我就跟着他们走吧。
    我先到了山炮营，炮兵们正忙碌着明天出发的事情。这是九月六日下午，距离明天出发的时间至少还有十二小时，但炮手们都在卸炮，拆炮，擦洗零件，修理鞍架，打点器具箱，清理被服器材，并且把牲口拉出来驮起炮，作行军的试验，以检查驮载重量与器材的结合有无缺陷；这一切都是长途进军以前必须的工作，一般在三小时到四小时以内才能完成，如果再加上个人的给养、被服及随身东西的准备，往往要半天的时间。他们从晚饭后忙到天黑，才结束这一段工作。炮兵团政治委员曾谦虚的向我介绍：我们炮兵的特点就是“笨重”、“ｌｕō＠①嗦”、“分散”，特别在行军中更加“麻烦”。这在粗看起来，似乎是首先被人发现的特点。
    这特点继续被我注意：
    第二天早八时出发，但炮兵们五时就起床了。驭手们忙着饮马、卸桩、绑槽（帆布槽，行军时在捆驮鞍上），上鞍具。炮后们又把山炮拆卸下来，按照昨天的准备把各部分分别架到驮鞍上，作起伪装，才开始行动起来。上次向兰州进军，每天是宽阔平坦的淡青色的公路，山炮都可以套架前进，炮车不用拆下来驮着，只用两个大骡子拉上就走的很快。但这次不同，我们从兰州东北的大路上只走了十几里，便突然朝正北一拐，走入一条狭窄曲折，凹凸不平的小沟，越走越高，越高越陡，到达山顶，离进沟的地方已有二十多里，但山顶上还有更高的山顶。从这山顶到那一山顶，每一步都是上下，没有平地。山顶上雨雾弥漫，小路泥泞斜陡，驮炮的骡子就一步比一步艰难起来，因为一门山炮分配在六个骡子身上，每头骡子平均驮二百五十斤以上，每在上坡的时候，前面便传来谨慎的口令：“紧前绊，松后绊！”牲口慢慢停下来，驭手们忙把牲口胸前的皮带紧上一节，尾后的皮带松开一些，走开时，牲口的距离渐渐拉长。下坡时立刻又传来：“紧后绊、松前绊！”驭手们又照样忙碌一阵，这样，牲口的距离越拉越长，行进的速度越来越慢，人们在中间零星散乱的走着。中午以后山炮营和团部停在山下村子里休息了一点多钟，后面的重迫击炮营还没有赶到，这里又开始出发了。以后在二十分钟以上的休息时间，首先把炮从牲口上卸下来，使牲口休息，然后才轮到人休息，前进时再架到牲口上，这样又耽误十几分钟。将近宿营地时，甚至两个连的距离也拉到一里多路。他们行进的速度，较步兵几乎慢了一半。
    到宿营地，炮兵们先不能进入房所，炮手连背包都不放下，首先是卸炮、拆炮，他们把器材箱打开，把炮上的零件逐一擦拭，有些潮湿生锈的地方，还要用煤油细擦，特别是闭锁机（似乎相当于枪拴）费时较大，连擦带上每次需半点钟的时间。另外有的修理炮架、驮鞍，等到把各部分擦完以后，再结合起来，就装成一个全炮，并排停放在门前的广场上，用绿深色的炮布掩盖起来。驭手在炮卸下以后，立刻把牲口拉到空地上慢慢的遛；每天行程六十里以内时，至少遛一点半钟，走七、八十里，就要遛两点钟，此外是埋马桩，拴马槽，领草料，直到黄昏，把马背上最后一层水屉子揭下来，才能休息。一连指导员耿明说：炮兵每到宿营地必须忙碌三小时以后才能休息，如遇到特殊困难的情况，更不能预定了。他们对炮和牲口都有了感情，也就习惯了这种生活。
    三天了，我每天总看到这样忙碌辛苦的生活，找不到适当的机会和他们谈话，接触的尽是这些属于“笨重”，“ｌｕō＠①嗦”的事情。这样能了解我们的炮兵吗？我要找出炮里基本的特点——他们在兰州是怎样立的功呢？
　　二　在轻快的部队前面
    第四天出发，还是沿着山顶走，山顶上云雾弥ｍéｎｇ＠②，时而飘着雨丝，时而变成浓雾，中午时，太阳渐渐露出头来，山顶的路也转平了，先头部队一望到前面的平川便欢声吵闹起来，有的大声叫着：“真豁亮呀！这几天可把我蹩坏了！”有的说：“到大川里买西瓜吃去！”队伍渐渐快了，行列间的距离也渐渐挨紧。这时我插到三连的队伍里，和他们闲扯起来，连长向我介绍了一位四十多岁，嘴边生满胳腮胡子的老炮手。他是七班长张维新，甘肃敦煌人，曾在傅作义三十五军里干炮兵十多年；从驭手一直到炮车长，去年察南新保安战斗中解放过来，在兰州战役立了一功。我想和他谈谈打兰州的情形，他说话迟缓而低沉，又很拘谨谦虚的不愿提起自己的功劳。别人都说他在战斗中起的作用很大，他自己总是说：“没有什么。”我问了半天，他只说：“阵地一定要铲平，两个车轮放平，这才稳当。炮上的螺丝要事先紧好，在转移和射击时就不至于震动，有震动也小，就好瞄准”。
    后来我又找他们排长谈，找他班的战士谈，对于他的作用，别人都很清楚。
    　　　　　×　　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　　×
    兰州战役中，第四炮（属第七班）是打得最好的炮。在连续行军十几天，好容易赶到兰州抓住敌人，谁也蹩不住劲了，队伍马上由行军序列转入战斗序列，首先朝着十里山附近阵地上开，那时一、二炮都在前面，四炮落后有二里多路。离近十里山时，敌人的炮弹接连打过来，平地上突然冒起两三丈高的尘土黑烟，把骡子惊得乱跑乱窜，驭子们抓紧缰绳被牲口拉得遍地打滚也不撒手，终于把牲口牵到距阵地三百公尺地方才停下来。班长张维新把上身衣服一脱，光着膀子，一个人先上去挖阵地，他说：“我一个人先挖，挖到能挡住两个人了，你们再上来。”挖深了，也只叫两三个人上来，别人想上去，他就着急：“不行，人多了太暴露，也容易把阵地挖大了，出土多，浪费时间，反倒不好。”于是别人只管搬运，他们一边挖一边“结合”，到阵地挖成，山炮也结合好了。结果比先到的各班都快（别的班有挖完再搬再结合的，就慢多了）。
    指挥所里用电话传来命令：朝十里山正面敌人的机枪阵地开炮，四炮阵地上，张维新亲自瞄准，他把距离定在二千二百公尺上，从炮镜里可以看到敌人阵地上那个弧形的小土堆，他把这个目标和镜头上的十字对正，立刻叫二炮手拉火，第一发炮弹打出去，那土堆上立刻升起烟来，接着一气打了八发，浓烟夹着黄土碎屑腾入半空，象一堵褐色的墙壁，弧形的小土堆随着就不见了。这时又传来指挥所的电话：“全部命中，转移阵地！”他们便趁着夜色向南转移，到达时天已黎明，这里离敌人只一千多公尺，敌人的轻重机枪连成一个声音的向这里扫射着，子弹在身子周围卟卟的响，他们阵地上只留下三个人，开炮命中，接着又连放十七发，那机枪阵地上便不叫了。
    总攻窦家山的前夜，细雨霏霏，炮兵们踏着泥泞的山路，走到指定阵地，在漆黑的深夜里构筑掩蔽工事，一边挖一边用手摸着，挖成以后，工事的深宽完全合适。天明了，传来命令，首先朝窦家山一号阵地下面的小地堡发射，掩护突击队冲锋。这时，张维新把第四炮定成一千九百公尺距离，只打出三发，眼看突击队的红旗立刻插在小地碉的跟前，烟雾中迎风招展。电话上立刻叫延伸射击，朝一号阵地上最大的碉堡打，这次把距离定到两千一百公尺，开炮命中，他亲眼看到英勇的步兵们正冲向大碉堡，紧接着又打出二十多发，步兵就进到大碉跟前了，红旗高高的竖在山头；但左面村子里还有敌人正朝着红旗反冲，那红旗一会儿拿下来，一会儿又插上去，满山头尘土漫天，机枪象爆豆子一样吵叫。他又把距离定到二千五百公尺，朝那村子里连打了十几发；这时烟雾遮住一切，只听得枪声稀落，过了一会，便望见红旗已插到村子跟前了。
    突击队的英雄们不停的前进，当红旗插到二号阵地以后，又看到二连的二炮发出威力，排长曹云龙亲自修正瞄准，他用了四十四发炮弹，一步步的把红旗引到四号阵地的前沿，敌人又反扑了两次，我们的炮弹就一直朝红旗的前面飞炸，只见那红旗突然一撤，但过了一会，却在更远的前面摇摆起来。这时四号阵地后面，敌人的炮正拆卸开来，由两个人抬着一件件的往下撤呢！步兵也大背着机枪往后直跑。下午，我们占领了四号阵地，炮兵立刻向一号阵地上转移，准备掩护部队夺取五号阵地，到炮兵搬上五里高的山头，作好工事时，窦家山大小阵地都已插遍了胜利的红旗。这时，敌人不只退下窦家山，连兰州也不敢占了。
    这一天进军，战士们都很愉快，因为天晴了，入了大川，又走到平路。我就更是愉快，我不仅同样有上面三个原因，主要是今天在大家愉快中我串了两个连，和几个英雄们谈得很好，进一步接触到炮兵的基本特点：炮兵虽然“笨重”，“ｌｕō＠①嗦”，它的作用却在那轻快的部队前面！
    后来，我又见到政治委员，他和我谈了许多炮上的事情，并没有再提起笨重和＠嗦，最后只说了一句：“希望到宁夏以后能打上几个仗才好哇！……”
