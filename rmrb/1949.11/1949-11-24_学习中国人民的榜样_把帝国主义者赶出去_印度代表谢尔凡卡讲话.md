Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 23rd. The full text of the speech by Indian representative Shelvankar at the Beijing People's Rally celebrating the success of the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference is as follows:

	On behalf of the Indian people, who have had cultural exchanges with China since the time of Sakyamuni, I salute you. I am here on behalf of the Indian workers to learn the great thought of your Chairman Mao Zedong. I warmly welcome your great victory over the American imperialists and their running dogs; I am also proud to be here to salute the Chinese Communist Party that led the Chinese people to victory; I am also honored to salute the Chinese people and the leader of the Chinese Communist Party, Comrade Mao Zedong.

	Perhaps you would like to know how the people of India, Ceylon, and Burma feel about your victory? You know, we are struggling under difficult circumstances, and nearly 30,000 comrades from Indian trade unions and other organizations are suffering in prisons. Although we are subjected to suppression and persecution, our workers, farmers, women, and youth are strengthening our struggle day by day. Now the reactionary leader of India, Nehru, imitates the Japanese imperialists and uses severe punishment against our people. When we are engaged in such a difficult struggle, what encourages and motivates us is your great struggle and victory. Your army will soon reach the border of Tibet, and the British and American imperialists do not like this, nor does Nehru, who hopes to pick up the leftovers from under the imperialists' table, like this. However, the Indian and Tibetan people will warmly welcome your army into Tibet. The British imperialists will hold an imperial conference in Colombo, Ceylon, in January next year. The important topic of this conference is how to prevent the collapse of the British imperialists. However, before this conference is held, India, Burma, and Ceylon within the empire have already split off. As we struggle against the British imperialists, we resolutely follow your example. Perhaps the imperialists will implement desperate blockades against the struggle of the great people, and perhaps the imperialists will use Southeast Asia to attack the Soviet Union, China, and the world's democratic forces, but I can guarantee that even if war breaks out, not a single Indian will fight for them. You have already set an example for us - drive out the imperialists. That is how we feel about your victory.

	For a week, the great Chinese people have educated us and made us understand that we should talk less and do more, so let me end my speech.

	Long live the Chinese people and the People's Republic of China!
	Long live the great Chinese Communist Party and its leader Mao Zedong!
	Long live the advanced Comrade Mao Zedong and other advanced comrades all over the world!
	Long live Stalin, the great teacher of the working people and democratic forces of the world!

　　印度代表谢尔凡卡讲话
    【新华社北京二十三日电】印度代表谢尔凡卡在北京各界人民庆祝亚澳工会会议成功大会上的讲话全文如下：
    我代表从释迦牟尼开始就和中国有文化来往的印度人民向你们致敬，我是代表印度工人来学习你们毛泽东主席的伟大思想的。我很热烈地欢迎你们对于美帝国主义者及其走狗的伟大的胜利；我也感到骄傲，我能在这里向领导中国人民走向胜利的中国共产党致敬；我也很光荣，我能向中国人民和中国共产党的领袖毛泽东同志致敬。
    也许你们想要知道印度、锡兰、缅甸的人民对于你们胜利的感觉吧？你们知道，我们是在困难情形之下进行斗争的，几乎有三万印度工会的及其他团体的同志们在监狱内受苦。虽然我们受到镇压与迫害，但是我们的工人、农民、妇女和青年，正一天比一天地加强着我们的斗争。现在印度的反动头子尼赫鲁模仿日本帝国主义者，用严刑对待我们的人民。当我们进行这样困难的斗争时，鼓舞与勉励我们的是你们的伟大斗争和胜利。你们的军队很快要打到西藏边境，英美帝国主义者不喜欢这件事情，希望从帝国主义者桌子底下拾点残剩下来的食物的尼赫鲁也不喜欢这件事，但是，印度人民和西藏人民会热烈地欢迎你们的军队进入西藏。英帝国主义者明年一月就要在锡兰科伦布召开帝国会议了，这会议的重要议题就是怎样使英帝国主义者不致崩溃。可是在他们这个会议还没召开以前，帝国内部的印度、缅甸、锡兰就已分裂出来了。在我们向英帝国主义者作斗争时，我们坚决跟随你们的榜样。也许帝国主义者对于伟大的人民的斗争会实行绝望的堵阻，也许帝国主义者会用东南亚来进攻苏联、中国和世界民主力量，但是我可以保证，即使战争会爆发，印度人民没有一个会给他们打仗的。你们已经给我们奠定了榜样——把帝国主义者赶走。我们对于你们胜利的感觉就是这样。
    一星期来，伟大的中国人民教育了我们，使我们懂得要少说话，多做事，因此让我结束我的讲话吧。
    中国人民和中华人民共和国万岁！
    伟大的中国共产党及其领袖毛泽东万岁！
    全世界的先进毛泽东同志及其他先进同志们万岁！
    全世界劳动人民与民主力量的伟大导师斯大林万岁！
