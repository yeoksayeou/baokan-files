Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 26th -- According to a dispatch from Teletype News Agency, Paris: The French working people held a one-day general strike as scheduled on the 25th, responding to the call of the French General Confederation of Labor to protest the extremely low standard of living and the reactionary Pidault government's refusal to increase the monthly allowance of 3,000 francs. The general strike has brought French economic life to a standstill. Coal mines across the country have completely ceased operations, and national transportation has been paralyzed, with trains and buses unable to run. Dockworkers in ports across the country have stopped working, forcing many ships to anchor far from the coast. Not a single worker reported to work at the Renault automobile factory in Paris. 22,000 civil servants in Paris also participated in the strike. Construction work has also completely stopped. Due to transportation difficulties, only 30 members of parliament participated in the important parliamentary debate on foreign policy issues. The French General Confederation of Labor believes that the general strike achieved "100% success."

　　显示工人阶级力量愈益强大
  　法国总罢工如期举行
    廿五日全法经济生活陷于停顿
    【新华社北京二十六日电】据电通社巴黎讯：法国劳动人民已如期于二十五日举行总罢工一天，以响应法国总工会的号召，抗议极低的生活水平与皮杜尔反动政府拒绝按月增发三千法郎的津贴。总罢工已使法国经济生活陷于停顿状态中。全国煤矿完全停工，全国运输陷于瘫痪，火车班车不能开行，全国各港口的码头工人都停止工作，迫使许多船只远离海岸抛锚。巴黎雷诺汽车工厂没有一个人上工。巴黎二万二千名公务员也参加罢工。建筑工作亦全部停顿。由于交通上的困难，只有三十名国会议员参加了议会关于外交问题的重要辩论。法国总工会认为这次总罢工得到“百分之百的成功。”
