    Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, Lu Dekui
    Successfully Trials Low-Voltage Converter
    Coke Oven Plant Produces Indanthrene and Other Dye Raw Materials
    Will Officially Begin Mass Production and Supply to the Market
    [This Newspaper] Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant's Foundry Machine and Electrical Workshop's Electrical Repair Shop's Lu Dekui, in view of the high cost of low-voltage converters purchased from the market, and in order to save state funds, he independently trialed the production of low-voltage converters. He has now successfully trialed the product, and the test results are good. The total cost of raw materials was 25,000 yuan, saving 175,000 yuan compared to purchasing from the market.
    [Another Report] The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant has the equipment for by-product coking ovens. Currently, fifty Solvay-Keening ovens are in operation, producing seven tons of coal tar and two tons of light oil per day. In the future, when the plant's light oil refining plant begins operation, a large amount of residual solvent volatile oil will remain after the light oil is refined. In addition to selling the solvent volatile oil with a temperature of 140 to 160 degrees Celsius, the remaining heavy solvent oil has not yet been utilized. Shen Changchi, an engineer at the plant's coking plant, and Liu Rongzao, director of the laboratory, discussed and decided to conduct research and utilization. Through their continuous efforts over the past two months and with the assistance of Xing Qianming and Xu Xinyuan, technicians from the laboratory's oil group, excellent results have been achieved. Among them, coumarone resin (benzofuran plastic) has been produced. It has a wide range of uses and can be used as artificial paint, coatings, printing ink, insulating materials, paper sizing agents, and rubber compounding agents. It is reported that after the light oil refining plant of the coking plant begins operation, the plant will use the method of Liu and Shen to manufacture and supply it to the market in large quantities.
    In addition, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant's Coke Oven Plant has also achieved initial success in refining "anthracene". "Anthracene" is one of the main components of coal tar, and it is a basic raw material for manufacturing indanthrene dyes. In view of the needs of the market, the staff of the Coke Oven Plant decided to refine the crude "anthracene" produced by the plant into pure "anthracene", with its quality sufficient for manufacturing dyes. After several experiments, pure "anthracene" with an "anthracene" content of 95% has been produced in the laboratory. Preparations are now being made for formal large-scale production. In addition, "carbazole", which coexists with "anthracene" in crude "anthracene", is also being prepared for extraction, because "carbazole" is the main raw material for manufacturing Hydron Blue. Currently, the equipment for producing pure "anthracene" is being rushed to be made by the plant's staff.

    石景山钢铁厂鲁德魁
    试制低压变流器成功
    焦油厂制成阴丹士林等染料原料
    将正式大量生产供应市场
    【本报讯】石景山钢铁厂铸造厂机电课电器修理厂鲁德魁，鉴于从市面买的低压变流器太贵，为节省国家资财，他就自己试制低压变流器，现已试制成功，试验结果良好，原料费总共为二万五千元，较市场购买节省十七万五千元。
    【又讯】石景山钢铁厂，有副产炼焦炉之设备，现开索尔维庆热式炼焦炉五十只，日产焦油七吨，轻油总量二吨，将来该厂轻油精炼场开工，轻油经提炼后，剩余溶剂挥发油甚多，除摄氏一百四十到一百六十度以溶剂挥发油出售外，其余重溶剂油尚未利用。该厂炼焦厂工程师沈昌炽和化验室主任刘荣藻共同商量，决定加以研究利用。经过他们两个月来的不断努力和化验室油料组技工邢谦鸣、许心渊的协助，获得优良结果。就中制成古马龙树脂（甲骈呋喃塑胶）一种，用途很广，可以作假漆、涂料、印刷油墨、绝缘物品、纸的上胶料和橡皮的组合剂等。闻该厂炼焦厂在轻油精炼场开工以后，将用刘、沈二君之方法大量制造供应市面。
    另外，该钢铁厂焦油场精制“蒽”亦获初步成功。“蒽”（Ａｎｔｈｒａｃｅｈｅ）是煤焦油里的主要成分之一，它是制造阴丹士林染料的一种基本原料。焦油场的职工鉴于市场上的需要，决定将该场所产的粗“蒽”精制成纯“蒽”，其品质以足供制造染料为度。现经过几次试验，已能在实验室中制出含“蒽”百分之九十五之纯“蒽”。现正准备正式大规模生产。此外与“蒽”同时存在粗“蒽”中的“咔唑”（Ｃａｒｂａｚｏｌ）也准备提出来，因为“咔唑”是制造海昌蓝（Ｈｙｄｒｏｎ  Ｒｌｕｅ）的主要原料。现制作纯“蒽”的设备，该场职工正努力赶制中。
