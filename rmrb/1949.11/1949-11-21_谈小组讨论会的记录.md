On Records of Small Group Discussions
　　Zhang Liangchen

　　Our political class has held several small group discussions, but we are still not good at taking meeting minutes. Initially, some students excused themselves by saying, "I don't know how to take notes, I can't take good notes," and always let others do it; the students who took notes didn't have a very clear understanding of "how to record." Some recorders included many of their own opinions in the entire record; in more serious cases, they even intentionally or unintentionally modified other people's opinions, resulting in a situation of "keeping what suits them" and "deleting what doesn't." Some recorded a lot of beautiful rhetoric but didn't grasp the core of the speech, making it difficult for people to understand the speaker's original intention. In addition, some recorders didn't say a word during the discussion, as if taking notes meant they didn't have time to participate in the discussion. Still others were simply irresponsible, not listening attentively or taking notes carefully, only recording a few short lines for a two or three-hour meeting. Another common problem is that they take more detailed notes at the beginning, but gradually reduce the detail later, and finally completely forget their responsibility and give up recording altogether.

　　How should records be taken? Based on the problems we have discovered, we have summarized several things to pay attention to: First, we should record other people's opinions completely objectively, without including the recorder's personal opinions. Second, we must grasp the core of the speech. Speakers speak quickly, and since we generally cannot use shorthand, we should concisely select and record the opinions that revolve around the center of the discussion.

　　In small group discussions, it is best to use the original recording method, recording each person's words individually. Such records allow people to understand the situation during the discussion and also know who spoke too much or too little, which is helpful for the next small group discussion. In order to quickly make a summary after the meeting, the recorder can highlight the most important points in each person's speech at any time. And at the end of the entire record, the conclusions that have been reached and the unresolved issues should be written down separately, so that people can easily grasp the overall situation of the meeting.

　　Recording should not be done exclusively by a few people; everyone should learn. In small groups, it is best to take turns recording, and everyone should strive for and value the opportunity to learn recording work.

　　谈小组讨论会的记录
　　张良宸
    政治课的小组讨论，已经举行过多次了，但是我们的会议记录还做不好。最初有些同学们推说“不会记，记不好”，就永远让别人记；做记录的同学对于“怎样记录”，也没有一个很清楚的认识。有的记录者在全篇记录里参加了很多自己的意见；严重些的，甚至有意无意的修改了人家的意见，造成“合己则留”“不合则删”的情形。有的则是记了很多美丽的词藻，没有抓着发言的重心，让人看了很难体会到发言人的原意是什么。另外还有些记录者，在讨论会上一言不发，好象做了记录就没有功夫参加讨论了。还有些记录者则根本不负责任，没有用心听，也没有用心记，开会两三点钟，只记录了短短几行。还有一般的通病是开头时记得较详细，后来渐次递减，到最后就完全忘记自己的责任，也就完全放弃记录。
    记录究竟应该怎样做呢？根据我们所发现的毛病，归纳出几个要注意的事项：第一，应该完全客观的把别人的意见记录下来，不能掺杂记录者个人的意见。第二，要抓住发言的中心。发言人讲话很快，一般的既不能使用速记的方法，就应扼要的择其围绕讨论中心的意见记录下来。
    在小组讨论中，最好使用原始的记录法，把每个人讲的话，个别的记录下来，这样的记录，使人看了可以略知讨论时的情形，同时也可以知道那些人讲话太多或太少，对于下次的小组讨论会是有帮助的。为了能够在会后很快的做一个总结，做记录的可以在每个人发言里，随时把最重要的用笔划出。并且应该在全篇记录的后面，把已得到的结论，未解决的问题分别写下来，使人看了容易抓住整个会的情形。
    做记录不应该只由几个人专门去搞，每个人都应该学习。在小组中最好是轮流做记录，每个人应该争取和重视学习记录工作的机会。
