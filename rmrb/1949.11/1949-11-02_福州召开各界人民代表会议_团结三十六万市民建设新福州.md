Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, November 1st: The Fuzhou Municipal People's Representatives Conference was held from the 20th to the 24th of last month. A total of 288 representatives attended. At the meeting, Wei Guoqing, Director of the Fuzhou Municipal Military Control Commission and Mayor of Fuzhou, delivered a report on the takeover work of the past two months and the future administrative policy. He said: Fuzhou is a consumer city. Due to the long-term exploitation by the Kuomintang bandit gangs, national industry has been shrinking, and handicrafts are on the verge of complete bankruptcy. In the two months since liberation, the People's Government has established revolutionary order, stabilized finance and prices, which has laid a considerable foundation for the future construction of a new Fuzhou for the people. However, it is very difficult to transform a consumer city like Fuzhou into a productive city. To overcome these difficulties, the people of the city must do everything possible to support the People's Liberation Army in quickly eliminating the remaining bandits; restore water and land transportation, and strengthen the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas and between regions; restore industrial production and maintain the continued production of some handicrafts as much as possible; continue to mobilize and organize unemployed and jobless people to return to their hometowns for production; build a new democratic culture and thoroughly eliminate the remaining poison of reactionary culture; practice strict economy and reduce unnecessary expenses. After group discussions, the conference unanimously approved Director Wei's report on the takeover work. The representatives unanimously praised the People's Government for its selfless dedication in the takeover work over the past two months, its efforts to stabilize prices, ensure people's livelihoods, and properly handle former personnel. They were particularly moved by Director Wei's sincere and humble spirit of self-criticism in his report. Scientific worker Huang Juemin said: "This is the first time we have heard a government report talking about its own shortcomings. The People's Government's courage to examine itself is truly our example." Female worker representative Chen Xuezhu said: "The government is so humbly asking everyone for their opinions. I have never been able to speak, but I want to go on stage and say a few words." She bravely stepped onto the stage and called on the women of Fuzhou to organize and resolutely implement various resolutions of the conference. Worker representative Yi Lihui stated that he must work hard to produce and unite with national capitalists in the spirit of benefiting both labor and capital, restore and develop production, and support the People's Liberation Army. Farmer representative Wang Fangle said: "We must better supply the city with rural materials, help the city restore production, and support the front lines." Industrial and commercial representative Ni Songmao said that he would go back and promote the idea well, calling on industrialists and businessmen to unite with workers, jointly restore production, and support the front lines. On the last day of the conference, after passing various proposals, a closing ceremony was held. In his closing speech, Mayor Wei called on all representatives to return and widely convey the spirit and resolutions of the conference, so that all 360,000 citizens of the city would take action and strive to build a new Fuzhou.

　　福州召开各界人民代表会议
  　团结三十六万市民建设新福州
    【新华社福州一日电】福州市各界人民代表会议于上月二十日至二十四日举行。出席代表共二百八十八人。会上福州市军事管制委员会主任兼福州市市长韦国清就两个月来的接管工作和今后施政方针作了报告。他说：福州是一个消费城市。由于国民党匪帮的长期搜刮，民族工业日趋萎缩，手工业濒于完全破产。解放两个月来，人民政府建立了革命秩序，稳定了金融和物价，这就为今后建设人民的新福州奠定了相当的基础。但是要将福州这样消费的城市变为生产的城市，困难是很多的。要克服这些困难，全市人民必须尽一切可能支援解放军迅速肃清残匪；恢复水陆交通，加强城乡之间及区域之间的物资交流；恢复工业生产和尽可能维持部分手工业的继续生产；继续动员和组织无业和失业人员回乡生产；建设新民主主义的文化，彻底肃清反动的文化余毒；厉行精简节约，减少不必要的开支。在分组讨论后，大会一致通过了韦主任的接管工作报告。代表们对于两个月来人民政府在接管工作中的大公无私及努力平稳物价，安定民生，妥善处理旧人员等工作，一致赞扬，对于韦主任在报告中的诚恳虚心的自我批评精神，更是非常感动。科学工作者黄觉民说：“我们头一次在政府的报告中听到讲自己的缺点，人民政府勇于检讨自己的精神，实在是我们的榜样。”女工代表陈雪珠说：“政府这样虚心要大家提意见，我从来不会说话的，也要上台去讲几句”。她勇敢地走上台去，号召福州市妇女组织起来，坚决执行大会各种决议。工人代表伊立惠表示，一定要努力生产，本着劳资两利的精神团结民族资本家，恢复和发展生产，支援解放军。农民代表王方乐说：“我们要更好地以农村物资供应城市，帮助城市恢复生产和支援前线。工商界代表倪松茂表示回去要好好宣传，号召工商业者与工人团结起来，共同恢复生产，支援前线。大会最后一天，在通过各项提案后举行闭幕式。韦市长在闭幕词中号召全体代表回去后普遍传达会议的精神和决议，使全市三十六万市民都行动起来，为建设新福州而奋斗。
