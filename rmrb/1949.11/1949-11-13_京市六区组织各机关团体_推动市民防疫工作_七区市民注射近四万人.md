Seven Districts in Beijing Organize Institutions and Groups to Promote Epidemic Prevention Work Among Citizens

[This newspaper dispatch] The Beijing Six Districts Epidemic Prevention Sub-committee convened a meeting on the morning of the 9th attended by over sixty responsible persons from various institutions and groups within the districts. The meeting decided on specific methods for each unit to participate in epidemic prevention work:

(1) In addition to contacting their directly superior level, each institution and group's epidemic prevention branch should maintain close contact with the district epidemic prevention sub-committee for work convenience, and jointly plan how to carry out mass epidemic prevention propaganda and inspection work.
(2) In addition to conducting thorough cleaning and sweeping within each institution, assist the masses in carrying out a general street sweeping movement during Sunday holidays.
(3) During the epidemic prevention period, make every effort to transfer cadres and free up time to hold small-scale discussion meetings with the masses near the institutions; go directly to households for inspection and conduct propaganda.
(4) For households that do not love cleanliness, some units proposed that in addition to conducting more propaganda and explanation with them, they should also personally help them clean their yards to influence and educate them to change. (Liu Wenbin)

[This newspaper dispatch] As of the 11th, the Beijing Seventh District's epidemic prevention inoculation work, in addition to those inoculated independently by various institutions and groups, the district inoculation team and various hospitals have inoculated a total of 38,303 people. The first inoculation is declared largely completed. It is planned to start the second inoculation tomorrow (the 14th). (Wang Xingchang)

    京市六区组织各机关团体
    推动市民防疫工作
    七区市民注射近四万人
    【本报讯】京市六区防疫分会在九日上午召开了一次全区境内各机关、团体负责人会议，到会六十余人。决定各单位具体参加防疫工作办法：
    （１）各机关团体防疫支会除与其直属上级联系外，为了工作便利，要与区防疫分会取密切联系，共同计划如何开展群众防疫宣传检查等工作。（２）除各机关内部进行清洁大扫除外，在星期日例假时间，协助群众开展普遍街道大扫除运动。（３）在防疫期间尽量抽调干部，抽出时间，召开机关附近群众小型座谈会；直接深入到户进行检查，并进行宣传。（４）对不爱清洁的户，有的单位提议除多与他们进行宣传解释外，并准备亲自与他们打扫院子，以此影响和教育使之转变。    （刘文彬）
    【本报讯】京市七区防疫注射工作，截至十一日止，除各机关团体自行注射者外，该区注射组和各医院计共注射三万八千三百零三人。第一次注射宣告大部完成。拟于明（十四）日开始进行第二次注射。（王星长）
