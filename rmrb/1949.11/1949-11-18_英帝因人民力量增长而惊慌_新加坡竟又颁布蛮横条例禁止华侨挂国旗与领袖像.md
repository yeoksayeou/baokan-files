　　British Imperialism Panics Due to Growing People's Power
    Singapore Actually Promulgates Barbaric Regulations Prohibiting Overseas Chinese from Hanging National Flags and Leader Portraits
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 17th] Reuter reported on the 14th: The British authorities in Singapore recently promulgated emergency regulations prohibiting residents from hanging national flags and portraits of contemporary or deceased people's leaders, with violators subject to six months imprisonment. Police have the right to search any place displaying flags. It is understood that this regulation is mainly aimed at the overseas Chinese in Singapore, because the local overseas Chinese recently celebrated the glorious victory of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and hung portraits of Chairman Mao and the national flag of the People's Republic of China. Reuter stated that this regulation represents the British imperialists' "increasing panic and setbacks in the colonial war" in Malaya.

　　英帝因人民力量增长而惊慌
    新加坡竟又颁布蛮横条例禁止华侨挂国旗与领袖像
    【新华社北京十七日电】电通社十四日讯：新加坡英当局最近颂布紧急条例，禁止居民悬挂国旗和当代的或过世的人民领袖的像片，违者将处以六个月的徒刑。警察有权搜查任何悬挂旗帜的地方。据悉，这个条例主要是对付新加坡的华侨。因为该地华侨最近曾为中国人民解放军的辉煌胜利而欢呼庆祝，并悬挂毛主席的画像和中华人民共和国的国旗。电通社称，这个条例正表示马来亚英帝国主义者的“日益增长的惊慌和在殖民地战争中的挫败”。
