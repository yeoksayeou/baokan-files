Democratic National Construction Association Beijing Branch representative Wang Biao said: "Initially, some people thought that the tax rate of twelve jin of millet per yuan was a bit too high, but after listening to Vice Mayor Zhang's report, we understood that these taxes are necessary expenses for construction, and the industrial and commercial sectors should pay them in full. At the same time, from the tax proposals, we see the government's democratic and cautious attitude even more. After careful study by the government, the tax proposals were submitted to the First All-Circles People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee for discussion and approval, and then submitted to this conference for discussion. However, still fearing that yesterday's discussion was not sufficient, we continued the discussion today. This is true democracy."

Worker representative Qiu Fangyu said: "This time, most of the tax revenue will be handed over to the Construction Bureau as construction funds. Those who should contribute money will contribute money, and we workers will definitely complete the construction tasks and repair the roads well."

Hui representative Yang Yisan said: "I am a food vendor. In the past, although carrying a pole didn't involve large donations, the money taken was more than the ninth-class donation. Because the special agents ate and took things for free, and if they got angry, they would smash plates and slap faces. Now, those 'special donations' are gone. We pay taxes for construction, to repair roads and run schools, which benefits us. We are very happy to do so."

Medical worker representative She Yidi said: "The People's Government took over Beijing from the hands of the Kuomintang reactionaries, and it was a chaotic mess. Our first task is construction. Building our own city, the costs should of course be borne by ourselves. The government has truly fulfilled its responsibilities. We believe that the tax revenue is very reasonable, and medical workers fully support it."

Industrial and commercial sector representative Zhao Yizhi said: "The government's tax proposals have been carefully considered and are fair and reasonable. Mayor Nie guaranteed in his report that not a single penny would be wasted. But we look at the past reactionary old government, which took the people's tax money and put it in their own pockets. What about now? Our mayor and general working comrades are all working hard and laboriously. The government is the people's government! Therefore, I, on behalf of the industrial and commercial sector, sincerely support the government's tax policy. To facilitate the payment of taxes by the industrial and commercial sector, we hope that the tax payment methods can be done in installments."

Student representative Yang Xiaofu said: "We must call on students throughout the city to assist the government, widely publicize, complete the tax collection work, and complete the task of building the people's capital."

Worker representative Liu Rongfu said: "Our rickshaw pullers now have cooperatives and clinics, and we can also buy cheap grain. My three children are all in school, and these are all the benefits given to us by Chairman Mao. Now, many roads have been repaired, which is of great benefit to us rickshaw pullers, so we are in favor of levying taxes for construction."

Farmer representative Guan Zongyin said: "Before liberation, did the Kuomintang reactionaries even consult with everyone when levying taxes? They just sat at the table and said how much it would be! This time, not only is there repeated consultation and discussion at the conference, but there are also reduction and exemption measures for agricultural taxes in the suburbs, and there are also tax exemption points. This is really fair and reasonable. Paying taxes to build a new China well will allow everyone to live a good life!"

Worker representative Wu Dekuan said: "It is very reasonable to collect taxes for the construction of a new Beijing."

Worker representative Lü Jingping said: "Everyone unanimously supports the government's tax proposals, which shows that the government's handling is reasonable, and the government is the people's government! After our research, we believe it is fair and reasonable because: first, the Kuomintang reactionaries left behind a broken mess for us to clean up; second, it is taken from the people and used for the people; third, the expenses of the city should not be added to the burden of the farmers. We are all masters of the new China, and under the leadership of Chairman Mao, let us strive to build a new China and a new Beijing!"

### “建设自己的城市，费用当然应该自己负担”

　　“建设自己的城市，费用当然应该自己负担”
    民主建国会北京分会代表汪镳说：“最初有些人认为税收的每分十二斤小米，有点过高，但是听了张副市长的报告后，我们知道这些税款都是建设上必需的费用，工商业界是应该照数缴纳的。同时，从税收提案中，我们更看出了政府民主慎重的态度，税收提案经政府仔细研究后，提交第一届各界人民代表会议协商委员会讨论通过之后，再交由本次大会讨论，但是还怕昨天讨论得不充分，今天又继续讨论，这才是真正的民主。”
    工人代表仇方域说：“这次税款大部将交建设局作为建设费用，该拿钱的拿钱，我们工人则一定完成建设任务，把路修好。”
    回民代表杨益三说：“我是食品小贩，过去挑挑子的虽然没有大捐，但是拿的钱比九等捐还多。因为特务们白吃白拿，一生气还摔碟子打嘴巴。现在这些“特等捐”都没有了，我们纳税做建设费用，修路、办学校，对我们有好处，我们非常乐意。”
    医务工作者代表佘贻倜说：“人民政府由国民党反动派手中接过来的北京，是一堆乱摊子，我们第一个任务就是建设。建设自己的城市，费用当然应该自己担负，政府是真正尽了职责了。我们认为税收非常合理，医务工作者完全拥护。”
    工商业界代表赵宜之说：“政府税收提案是经过缜密考虑的，是公平合理的。聂市长在报告中保证说：决不浪费一文钱。而我们看着过去反动旧政府，是拿人民税收的钱，下自己腰包的，现在呢？我们的市长和一般工作同志都辛勤劳苦，政府是人民的政府了！所以，兄弟代表工商业界竭诚拥护政府税收政策。为便利工商业界缴纳税款，希望在纳税方法方面。能分期缴纳。”
    学生代表杨晓芙说：“我们要号召全市的同学，协助政府，广泛宣传，完成税收工作，完成建设人民首都的任务。”
    工人代表刘荣夫说：“我们三轮车夫现在有了合作社、诊疗所，还可以买便宜粮食。我的三个小孩都上了学，这都是毛主席给我们的好处。现在马路修好了很多，对我们三轮车夫的好处很大，所以我们赞成征税来建设。”
    农民代表管宗印说：“解放前，国民党反动派征税那还找大家商量，坐在桌子上说多少就多少！这次，不但反复商量，在大会上讨论，对郊区农业税还有减免办法，还有免税点，这实在是公平合理。纳税把新中国建设好了，让大家过好日子！”
    工人代表吴德宽说：“为建设新的北京而收税，很合理。”
    工人代表吕静平说：“大家对政府税收提案一致拥护，这表示：政府处理合理，政府是人民的了！我们研究后，认为公平合理，因为：一、国民党反动派留下一个破摊子，要我们整理；二、是取之于民，用之于民的；三、不可将城内费用再加在农民头上，我们都是新中国的主人，在毛主席领导下，让我们为建设新中国新北京而奋斗！”
