　　Ministry of Education Holds Symposium to Discuss Problems in Philosophy Teaching

　　[This newspaper dispatch] The Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government convened the third symposium on dialectical materialism and historical materialism yesterday morning (the 6th). More than 90 professors, lecturers, teaching assistants, and student representatives from universities in Beijing and Tianjin attended the meeting, which was presided over by Zhang Zonglin. First, representatives of teachers and students from various universities in Beijing and Tianjin reported on the recent teaching situation of the course. Then, Ai Siqi pointed out that the study of this course in various schools has generally entered the right track and is actively creating experiences. In the future, attention should still be paid to how to collect and analyze students' ideological situations, extract universal problems, and explain them with systematic and comprehensive theoretical knowledge and connect them with various practical activities, penetrating deep into the students' minds to achieve the purpose of ideological transformation. He emphasized the importance of transforming petty-bourgeois ideology under the new democratic regime, and called on everyone to study Chairman Mao's great significance in "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship": after the people have seized power, they use democratic methods to educate themselves to eliminate the bad ideological influences given by the old society. Qian Junrui, Deputy Minister of Education, emphasized the social roots and characteristics of the petty-bourgeois intellectuals' ideology, and said that in order to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, we must gradually but resolutely transform non-proletarian ideology with proletarian ideology, so that we can better serve the construction of the new China. Finally, he hoped that teachers in various schools would attach importance to internationalist education to welcome the upcoming Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference and the Asian Women's Conference to be held in Beijing. The meeting adjourned at 12 o'clock.
