Xinhua News Agency, Dalian, 10th. The Second Workers' Representative Conference of Lüshun-Dalian (Lüda) was held on the 30th of last month and closed on the 1st of this month. Attending the conference were 509 worker representatives from various public and private enterprises in the Lüda area, as well as 914 labor heroes and model workers. The conference discussed and approved the report on the "Three-Year Work Summary and Future Tasks of the Lüda Federation of Trade Unions," as well as resolutions on "Further Implementing Rationalization Proposals, Launching the New Record Creation Movement to Correctly Implement Economic Accounting," and "On Signing Collective Contracts for Public and Private Enterprises." It also elected the Second Executive Committee of the Lüda Federation of Trade Unions. Ouyang Qin, Secretary of the Lüda District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Han Guang, Director of the Lüda Administrative Office, Samoilova, Chairman of the Soviet Trade Union in the Lüda area, and trade union representatives from Tianjin, Shandong, Chahar, and other places attended and spoke at the conference. In his speech, Ouyang Qin pointed out that trade union work should be all for production. Welfare work for workers should be done on the basis of developing production, and good welfare work can promote the development of production. He also pointed out that trade union cadres should go deep into factories and get close to workers. The trade union should put most of its manpower and time in factories, and a small part of its manpower and time in offices. Shen Ce, Secretary-General of the Lüda Federation of Trade Unions, pointed out in the "Three-Year Work Summary and Future Tasks of the Lüda Federation of Trade Unions" report that Lüda workers have played a great role in the restoration and development of production in the past three years. The three-year process has also proved that "developing production" is the highest principle for trade unions to solve all problems, otherwise, trade union work cannot be done well. He asked everyone to quickly correct the bad work styles of bureaucracy and formalism in trade union work, and called on Lüda workers to actively participate in economic construction, promote rationalization proposals, launch the new production record creation movement, and further strive to implement the economic accounting system and improve labor productivity. During the discussion on "Further Implementing Rationalization Proposals, Launching the New Record Creation Movement to Correctly Implement Economic Accounting," the conference unanimously agreed that this is an important measure to further improve the Lüda production movement and a powerful guarantee for the completion of the Lüda area's two-year economic construction plan. During the discussion on "Signing Collective Contracts for Public and Private Enterprises," the meeting believed that this is a guarantee for improving productivity, clearly dividing the responsibilities of the administration and the trade union in production, and putting production on a regular basis in public enterprises; and in private enterprises, it is the best way to implement the policy of "developing production, benefiting both labor and capital" and resolving labor-capital disputes. Finally, the conference also rewarded 914 labor heroes and model workers.

    保证二年经济计划完成
    旅大召开二届职工代表会
    决定公私企业工会工作任务
    【新华社大连十日电】旅（顺）大（连）第二届职工代表大会于上月三十日举行，本月一日闭幕。出席这次大会的有旅大地区各公、私营企业的职工代表五百零九名，以及劳动英雄、模范九百十四人。大会讨论和通过了“旅大职工总会三年工作总结及今后任务”的报告，以及“进一步贯彻合理化建议，开展创造新纪录运动，以达到正确实行经济核算”、“关于签订公营、私营企业集体合同”等项决议，并选出了旅大职工总会第二届执行委员会。中共旅大区党委书记欧阳钦、旅大行政公署主任韩光、旅大地区苏联职工会主席山毛洛娃和天津、山东、察哈尔等地的工会代表都到会讲话。欧阳钦在讲话中指出：工会工作应该一切为了生产。应该从发展生产的基础上去作职工福利工作，而福利工作做得好，又可推动生产向前发展。他又指出：工会工作的干部要深入工厂，接近工人。工会应该把大部分的人力和时间放在工厂里，小部分的人力和时间放在办公室。旅大职工总会秘书长沈策在“旅大职工总会三年工作总结及今后任务”的报告中指出：三年来旅大工人在恢复和发展生产中起了伟大的作用。三年的过程也证明了“发展生产”是工会解决一切问题的最高原则，否则就不能做好工会工作。他在要求大家迅速纠正工会工作中的官僚主义、形式主义等恶劣作风，并号召旅大工人兄弟积极参加经济建设，推广合理化建议，开展创造生产新纪录运动，进一步为贯澈经济核算制和提高劳动生产率而斗争。大会在讨论“进一步贯彻合理化建议，展开创造生产新纪录运动，以达到正确实行经济核算制”时，一致认为这是目前进一步提高旅大生产运动的重要措施，也是完成旅大地区两年经济建设计划的有力保证。在讨论“签订公营企业和私营企业集体合同”时，会议认为这在公营企业中是提高生产率，明确划分行政和工会双方在生产中的职责，使生产走上正规化的保证；而在私营企业中则是贯彻“发展生产，劳资两利”政策，以及解决劳资纠纷的最好办法。大会最后并奖励了九百十四名劳动英雄模范。
