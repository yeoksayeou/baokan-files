　　American Control of British Naval Bases
  　Red Navy Newspaper Article

    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 26th - The Red Navy Newspaper published an article by Kudryavtsov titled "British Naval Bases Under American Control," stating: The transfer of Great Britain's military and naval bases to American control began in 1940. At that time, the two countries signed an agreement in which the United States leased British naval and air bases in Newfoundland, Bermuda (in the Atlantic Ocean east of the United States), Jamaica, Antigua, Trinidad (all three islands belonging to the West Indies of the Americas), and British Guiana. However, the United States was by no means limited to the agreement to lease British bases in the Americas; it also attempted to extend its control to other British bases. Due to the British ruling group's participation in the North Atlantic Treaty, they have in effect enabled the United States to extensively use British military bases. Although four and a half years have passed since the end of the war, the American imperialists are still using British bases in the Mediterranean - Malta and Cyprus. The United States is particularly active in the Pacific. In addition to the islands it now calls trust territories (islands that were formerly Japanese mandated territories before World War II and are now used by the U.S. fleet), it is also attempting to acquire British assets in this theater. In May 1949, the Daily Telegraph and Morning Post, in discussing Australian Prime Minister Chifley's statement, wrote that an agreement had been reached on the joint U.S.-Australian use of British bases in the Pacific. American expansionists are also not neglecting bases in Canada. According to newspaper reports, the Canadian Navy has become an appendage of the U.S. Navy. Now, in all naval exercises, the Canadian Navy almost always participates jointly with the U.S. fleet. All the bases that Britain has handed over for use by the U.S. Navy are filled with American military expert groups. American warships systematically conduct visits to familiarize themselves with the new bases. The author recounts a decision by the U.S. Supreme Court as proof of the methods used by the American ruling group. The decision stipulates that foreign bases leased by the United States during wartime are the property of the United States, and therefore, U.S. law is valid in these territories. The author concludes by pointing out that the transfer of British naval bases to the United States is only one detail in the broad offensive by American monopoly capital against Britain's strategic position.

### 美国控制下的英国海军基地　红海军报专文

　　美国控制下的英国海军基地
  　红海军报专文
    【新华社北京二十六日电】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：红海军报发表库德里雅夫佐夫报所撰题为“美国控制下的英国海军基地”的专文称：大不列颠的军事和海军基地转交给美国控制，开始于一九四零年。那时候，两国签订了一个协定，美国租用英国在纽芬兰、百尔慕他群岛（在美国以东的大西洋中）、牙买加、安的瓜、特立尼达（三岛均属美洲之西印度群岛）及英属圭那亚等地的海军空军基地。但是，美国决不限于租用英国在美洲的基地的协定，它还企图将它的控制扩大到其他的英国基地。由于英国统治集团之参加北大西洋公约，他们实际上已使美国能够广泛地使用英国的军事基地。战争结束虽已四年半，可是，美帝国主义者仍然使用着英国在地中海的基地——马尔他和塞浦路斯。美国在太平洋特别活跃，除了它现在所谓托管的岛屿外（这些岛屿在第二次世界大战以前是日本的委任统治地，现在则由美国舰队使用），它还企图取得英国在这个战场上的资产。一九四九年五月，每日电讯晨邮报在论到澳大利亚总理齐佛莱的声明时写道，美澳共同使用英国在太平洋的基地的协议业已达成。美国扩张主义分子也不忽视在加拿大的基地。根据报纸的消息判断，加拿大海军已成了美国海军的附属物。现在，所有一切海军演习，加拿大海军几乎都与美国舰队联合举行。英国业已交由美国海军使用的一切基地，都充斥着美国的军事专家团。美国军舰有系统地进行访问，以熟悉新的基地。作者追述美国最高法庭的一项决议，作为美国统治集团所使用的方法的证明。该决议规定，战时美国所租用的外国基地是美国的财产，因此，美国法律在这些领土上有效。作者最后指出，英国海军基地之转交美国，只是美国垄断资本对英国战略地位的广泛攻势中的一个细节而已。
