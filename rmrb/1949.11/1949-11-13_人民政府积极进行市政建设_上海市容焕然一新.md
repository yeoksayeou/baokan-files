    The People's Government Actively Carries Out Municipal Construction
    Shanghai's City Appearance Takes on a New Look
    [Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 12th] The Shanghai People's Government is actively carrying out municipal construction work. In the five months since liberation, in addition to leveling pillboxes, removing garbage, organizing and concentrating vendors, cleaning underground sewers, and building seawalls, it has also built fifty bridges, repaired fifty-one roads, and started dredging the Suzhou Creek, giving Shanghai's city appearance a completely new look, sweeping away the traces of war, and presenting an atmosphere of neatness, cleanliness, and prosperity everywhere. The repaired road surface is approximately 36,000 square meters, completing two-thirds of the entire road repair plan. The largest project among them is the section of Nanjing Road from Zhejiang Road to Xizang Road, which was originally a wooden-block road and was severely damaged; it has been completely renovated. Currently, road repair work is still ongoing. Since the start of the Suzhou Creek dredging project on October 18th, two dredgers have been working, excavating over 900 cubic meters of mud per day, and it is scheduled to be completed by the end of the year. After the water level drops this winter, waterways will still be accessible, and urban-rural material exchange will continue as usual.

    人民政府积极进行市政建设
    上海市容焕然一新
    【新华社上海十二日电】上海人民市政府积极进行市政建设工作。解放后五个月来，除了平毁碉堡、清除垃圾、整理和集中摊贩、清理地下水道、修筑海塘外，还修建了五十座桥梁，修补了五十一条马路，并开始疏浚苏州河，使上海市容焕然一新，一扫战争的痕迹，到处是整齐清洁和欣欣向荣的气象。已经修好的马路路面约三万六千余平方公尺，完成了全部修路计划的三分之二。其中工程最大的是南京路上浙江路至西藏路一段，原为红木弹路，路面损毁不堪，已全部翻修。目前修路工作仍在继续进行。疏浚苏州河工程自十月十八日开始后，两部挖泥机进行工作，每天可挖泥九百余公方，预定年底竣工。今冬水降后，水路仍可畅通，城乡物资将可照常交流。
