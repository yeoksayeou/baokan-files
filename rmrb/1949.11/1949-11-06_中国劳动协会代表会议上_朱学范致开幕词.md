　　Zhu Xuefan, Chairman of the Chinese Labor Association, delivered the opening address at the Chinese Labor Association Representative Conference. The full text is as follows:

　　Comrades:

　　Today, the representative conference of the Chinese Labor Association opens in the people's capital—Beijing. At this conference, we will summarize the work of the Labor Association in the past fourteen years, discuss the organizational unification of the Labor Association and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and clearly decide the direction that our Labor Association comrades should follow in future trade union work. Therefore, this conference is a meeting of great significance in the history of the Labor Association.

　　The Labor Association has gone through a tortuous and uneven path from its establishment in 1935 to the present. Since Chiang Kai-shek betrayed the revolution in 1927 and carried out a massacre of workers and revolutionaries, the Chinese workers' movement has entered a low ebb. The working class, under the cruel suppression of the Kuomintang reactionaries, lost all freedom and rights. However, the Chinese working class, under the leadership of the Communist Party, never bowed its head in the face of violence. As Chairman Mao said, "The Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people were not intimidated, conquered, or exterminated. They crawled out of the ground, wiped the blood off their bodies, buried the bodies of their companions, and continued to fight." By 1935, the workers' struggle had surged again. At the same time, a nationwide anti-Japanese national salvation movement was also launched. Under the pressure of the broad masses of the people, the Kuomintang reactionary government had to pretend to be democratic, passed a draft pseudo-constitution, elected pseudo-National Assembly representatives, and prepared to implement so-called "constitutional government." The Chinese Labor Association came into being under these circumstances. According to the regulations of the reactionary government's trade union law at that time, national trade union organizations were not allowed to be established. Therefore, the Labor Association initially appeared as a labor cultural and welfare group, with the goal of gradually becoming a national trade union organization.

　　The Labor Association was a legal organization in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, and it could use this status to carry out public activities. Of course, the reactionary government was absolutely unwilling to allow workers to organize and did not allow workers to move freely. Its permission for the establishment of the Labor Association was to achieve its goal of trying to use the Labor Association to prevent the national workers' demand for a national trade union organization domestically, and to use the Labor Association as a democratic decoration abroad. Therefore, the reactionary government wanted to tightly control it at all times. Therefore, from the time of its establishment, the Labor Association had the opposition and struggle of progressive forces and reactionary forces within it. Because the progressive forces occupied the advantage, they finally won the victory.

　　The task of the Labor Association in the Kuomintang-controlled areas was to organize workers and raise their class consciousness through cultural education and welfare work. After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, the Labor Association moved from Shanghai to Hankou and then to Chongqing. During the Hankou period, due to the formation of the anti-Japanese national united front called for by the Chinese Communist Party, the people of the whole country bravely rose up and launched a desperate struggle against the Japanese imperialist aggressors. At this time, in order to unite the strength of the national working class regardless of party affiliation, gangs, or regions, to strengthen the anti-Japanese camp, the Labor Association, together with the trade unions in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and other places, jointly initiated the organization of the National General Labor Association to Resist the Enemy, so that the national workers could engage in the anti-Japanese struggle under the leadership of a unified organization. However, the Kuomintang reactionary government was deeply afraid that the unity of the national working class would shake the foundation of its dictatorial rule and hinder its conspiracy to compromise and surrender. Therefore, it desperately sabotaged the cause of national workers' unity and created various excuses to prevent the establishment of the National General Labor Association to Resist the Enemy. Although the General Labor Association to Resist the Enemy was not established, the will of the national workers to demand unity could not be stopped by any force. The unity of the national workers was manifested in another form. That is, more than 60,000 workers from the General Trade Union of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region joined the Labor Association as group members, and Liao Siguang and Liu Qunxian, two comrades representing the General Trade Union of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, participated in the work of the Labor Association. Therefore, the workers in the Kuomintang-controlled areas and the workers in the border areas shattered the Kuomintang's conspiracy to split the national workers and established a joint relationship. The cause of the unity of the national working class was thus laid a solid cornerstone.

　　During the Anti-Japanese War, the Labor Association engaged in the labor movement work under the policy of "destroying production behind enemy lines and increasing production in the rear." In 1939, the Labor Association represented Chinese workers in the International Federation of Trade Unions, establishing contact between the Chinese working class and international workers. The Labor Association actively carried out international propaganda work, reporting to the working brothers of the Allied countries the heroic struggles of the Chinese working class in the rear and behind enemy lines, and resolutely opposed American imperialism's supply of oil and scrap iron to Japan, which massacred the Chinese people. At that time, it aroused the deep sympathy of workers' brothers in various countries, who used actions to help China's war of resistance. In 1943, the Labor Association accepted donations from international workers and carried out workers' welfare undertakings in major cities in the rear. In 1944, trade unions in China, the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, France, and other countries initiated the organization of the World Federation of Trade Unions. When the World Federation of Trade Unions held its founding meeting in Paris in September 1945, the Kuomintang government refused to issue an exit passport to Comrade Deng Fa, director of the preparatory committee of the Trade Union Federation of the Liberated Areas, but the Labor Association insisted on going abroad together with the representatives of the Liberated Areas as a condition for attending, and finally won the victory. The Labor Association and the trade union representatives of the Liberated Areas organized a joint delegation to participate in the founding meeting of the World Federation of Trade Unions. Comrade Deng Fa and the representatives of the Labor Association were elected as directors, and the representatives of the Labor Association were also elected as vice-chairman of the World Federation of Trade Unions. At this time, after the Labor Association agreed to the eight-point proposal on the Chinese labor movement put forward by Comrade Deng Fa, the 920,000 workers of the Liberated Areas joined the Labor Association as a whole. The cause of unity of the national working class was further developed at this time.

　　After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the Labor Association accepted the political propositions of "peace, democracy, unity, and unification" of the CCP and other democratic parties. On January 30, 1946, after consulting with Comrade Deng Fa's opinions, it issued 23 political propositions, clearly stating the Labor Association's political stance of opposing dictatorship and demanding democracy. This incurred the Kuomintang reactionaries' jealousy and attack. The Kuomintang reactionary government's control policy over the Labor Association had been completely defeated. It tore off its democratic mask, revealed its fierce and cruel face, and directly used fascist brutal means to openly attack the Labor Association. In the Chongqing Jiaochangkou blood case, the Labor Association was one of the objects of the reactionaries' accusation. By mid-1946, the reactionary government's oppression of the Labor Association became even more intense. On August 6, the pro-government "Chongqing General Trade Union" led more than 200 military police special agents to armed receive all the Labor Association's organizations in Chongqing. The Labor Association's welfare work in Kaifeng, Xi'an, Guilin, Hankou and other places was also forced to stop. At this time, the reactionary government exhausted all means of threats and intimidation against the Labor Association, forcing the Labor Association to issue an anti-communist declaration, and forcing the Labor Association to exclude the trade unions of the Liberated Areas from the Labor Association's organization, but this was resolutely rejected by the Labor Association. Under these circumstances, the Labor Association's public existence in the Kuomintang-controlled areas was impossible. The Labor Association General Headquarters moved to Hong Kong, and the Labor Association's working methods changed from public to secret, from "legal" to "illegal", continuing to fight for the people's democratic revolution and the workers' freedom rights. At this time, some Labor Association members, such as Shui Xiangyun and An Futing, betrayed the Labor Association and sold out the interests of the working masses. Recently, Shui Xiangyun is still active in Taiwan, wanting to participate in the so-called "Asian Trade Union Federation" and act as a running dog of American imperialism. We must resolutely oppose this shameless behavior.

　　Historical facts have proved that the Chinese working class can only achieve true liberation under the leadership of its vanguard—the Chinese Communist Party, and its leader—Chairman Mao. The Labor Association comrades recognized this truth. In 1948, the Labor Association, together with the Preparatory Committee of the Trade Union Federation of the Liberated Areas and other democratic trade unions in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, jointly initiated the convening of the Sixth National Labor Congress, passed the resolution on the current tasks of the Chinese trade union movement, and restored the organization of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. The Labor Association became a group under the leadership of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. The national workers were united. Since 1938, the Labor Association has held high the banner of unity of the national working class, insisted on the united struggle of the national working class, and resisted the countless conspiracies of the Kuomintang reactionaries to split, and today, this unity of the national workers has been completely realized.

　　Since August of last year, the domestic situation has undergone major developments, the People's Liberation War has achieved great victories, the People's Political Consultative Conference, which symbolizes the great unity of the people of the whole country, has successfully closed, the People's Republic of China and the Central People's Government have been born, and the complete liberation of the whole country is not far away. The criminal rule of imperialism, feudalism, bureaucratic capitalism and its representative, the Kuomintang reactionary government, over the Chinese people has been overthrown. Due to the liberation of major cities such as Shanghai, Nanjing, Hankou, and Guangzhou, the situation of the national labor movement has also undergone major developments.

　　Today, it can be said that the Labor Association has completed its historical task. The purpose of the Labor Association's work is to oppose imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, to demand true democracy, to demand free trade unions, and to demand the unity of the national working class. Now, due to the great and brilliant victory of the People's Liberation War, the establishment of the Central People's Government unanimously supported by the people of the whole country, the resolute implementation of the people's democratic dictatorship, and the growth and development of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions over the past year, the Labor Association's demands have been completely realized. At the same time, because the national working class must be organized on the basis of industry in order to assume important responsibilities in the upcoming economic construction upsurge. The Labor Association is not an industrial organization and is no longer suitable for today's trade union organization principles, so there is no need to preserve the original organization of the Labor Association. The Labor Association and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions have now reached the stage where "organizational unification" is needed. At this conference, we must decide to end the organization of the Labor Association, and the members of the Labor Association should participate in the organizations of various industrial trade unions in various places in accordance with the organizational system of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. The cadres of the Labor Association should sincerely accept the leadership of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and work together to seek the interests of the working class. Although the organization of the Labor Association has ended, the work of the Labor Association comrades to participate in the construction of a new China under the leadership of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions has just begun, so the responsibility placed on us is even heavier. We have made some mistakes in the past, and we must examine ourselves. We must humbly learn the revolutionary theories of Marxism-Leninism, learn Mao Zedong Thought, and learn from the Soviet Union's experience in building the country, so as to continuously improve our political level. We must resolutely accept the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, carry the revolution through to the end, work hard to build a new democratic political economy and culture, transform agricultural China into industrial China, and steadily and gradually move from a new democratic society towards a socialist and communist society. We must resolutely abide by Chairman Mao's instructions to us on the one-sided policy, stand on the side of the democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union, defeat the conspiracy of British and American imperialism to instigate a third world war, and let the imperialists tremble in the face of the great power of the world's people! Finally, we must thank the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao for their wise and resolute leadership, and thank the Chinese People's Liberation Army for their heroic and unparalleled operations. We must pay them the highest respect. Let us shout:

　　Long live the great unity of the Chinese working class!

　　Long live the People's Republic of China!

　　Long live the Chinese Communist Party!

　　Long live Chairman Mao!

　　中国劳动协会代表会议上
  　朱学范致开幕词
    【新华社北京五日电】中国劳动协会理事长朱学范在中国劳动协会代表会议上的开幕词，全文如下：同志们：
    今天中国劳动协会的代表会议在人民的首都——北京开幕了。在这次会议上，我们要总结劳协在过去十四年的工作，我们要讨论劳协与全国总工会在组织上的统一，我们要明确决定我们劳协同志在今后工会工作中所应该遵循的方向。因此，这次会议，在劳协的历史上，是具有重大意义的一次会议。
    劳协从一九三五年成立到现在，经过了一段迂回的不平坦的道路。自从一九二七年蒋介石背叛革命，对工人和革命分子举行大屠杀以后，中国工人运动出现了一个低潮的时期，工人阶级在国民党反动派残酷压制下面，失去了一切自由权利，但是，中国工人阶级在共产党的领导下，从没有在暴力面前低过头，诚如毛主席所说的“中国共产党与中国人民，并没有被吓倒、被征服、被杀绝，他们从地下爬起来，擦干净身上的血迹，掩埋好同伴的尸首，他们又继续战斗了。”到了一九三五年，工人斗争又高涨起来了。同时，全国各地也掀起了抗日救国的浪潮。国民党反动政府在广大人民的压力下面不得不装装民主的姿态，通过了伪宪法草案，选举了伪国大代表，准备实行所谓“宪政”。中国劳动协会就在这种情势之下产生了。依照当时反动政府工会法的规定，是不准成立全国性的工会组织的，所以劳协最初是以劳动文化福利团体的姿态出现，而以逐步达到全国性的工会组织为目的。
    劳协在国民党统治区中是一个合法组织，它可以运用这个地位来进行公开的活动。当然，反动政府是绝对不愿意工人组织起来，不允许工人自由活动的，它准许劳协的成立，是为了达到它这样的目的，就是在国内方面，企图用劳协来阻止全国工人的组织全国性工会的要求，在国外方面，企图用劳协来作为它的民主的装饰品。因此，反动政府想一刻也不放松地紧紧地控制在它的手上。所以，劳协从它成立的时候起，内部就存在着进步力量和反动力量的对立、斗争。由于进步的力量占据着优势，最后终于得到了胜利。
    劳协在国民党统治区的工作任务，是通过文化教育和福利工作，来组织工人，提高他们的阶级觉悟，抗日战争爆发后，劳协由上海迁到汉口，再到重庆。在汉口时期，由于中国共产党所号召的抗日民族统一战线的结成，全国人民，英勇奋起，展开对日本帝国主义侵略者的拼死斗争。这时，劳协为了不分党派、不分帮口、不分地区地团结全国工人阶级的力量，以加强抗战阵营，就与陕甘宁边区工会以及其他各地的工会，共同发起组织全国工人抗敌总会，使全国工人在统一机构的领导之下，从事抗日斗争。但是国民党反动政府深怕全国工人阶级团结起来，会动摇它的独裁统治的基础，会妨碍它的妥协投降的阴谋，所以它拼命破坏全国工人的团结事业，制造种种借口来阻止全国工人抗敌总会的成立。工抗总会虽然没有成立，可是全国工人要求团结统一的意志，是任何力量也阻挡不住的。全国工人的团结，在另一种形式上表现出来。这就是陕甘宁边区总工会六万多工人在不久以后加入劳协为团体会员，陕甘宁边区总会工代表廖似光、刘群仙二同志参加了劳协的工作。因此国民党统治区工人与边区工人粉碎了国民党分裂全国工人的阴谋，而建立了联合的关系，全国工人阶级的团结事业，从此奠下了一块巩固的基石。
    在抗战时期，劳协在“敌后破坏生产，大后方增加生产”的方针下，从事工运工作。一九三九年，劳协代表中国工人参加国际工会联合会，建立起中国工人阶级与国际工人的联系。劳协积极进行国际宣传工作，向同盟国家的工人弟兄们报告中国工人阶级在大后方和敌后英勇斗争的事绩，并且坚决反对美帝国主义用石油废铁接济日本，屠杀中国人民。当时引起了各国工人弟兄的深切同情，他们用行动来援助中国的抗战。一九四三年，劳协接受国际工人的捐款，在大后方各大城市举办工人福利事业。一九四四年，中苏美英法等国工会发起组织世界工会联合会。当一九四五年九月，世界工联在巴黎举行成立大会的时候，国民党政府拒绝发给解放区职工联合总会筹备主任邓发同志出国护照，但劳协坚持与解放区代表一同出国为出席的条件，终于得到了胜利。劳协与解放区工会代表组织了联合代表团，参加了世界工联的成立大会，邓发同志与劳协代表都当选为理事，劳协代表并被选为世界工联副主席。这时，劳协同意邓发同志提出的对于中国工运的八点主张后，解放区工会的九十二万职工，就全体加入劳协。全国工人阶级的团结事业，这时候得到了进一步的发展。
    抗战胜利以后，劳协接受中共及其他民主党派的“和平、民主、团结、统一”的政治主张，在一九四六年一月三十日，于商同邓发同志的意见后，发表了二十三条政治主张，明确提出劳协的反对独裁、要求民主的政治立场。这样就招致了国民党反动派的忌恨和打击。国民党反动政府对劳协的控制政策，既已遭到完全的失败，它就撕下了民主的假面具，露出凶恶残忍的面目，而直接用法西斯的残暴手段，来公开打击劳协。重庆较场口血案中，劳协是反动派控诉的对象之一。到一九四六年中，反动政府对劳协的压迫，更是变本加厉，八月六日，御用的“重庆市总工会”率领军警特务二百多人，武装接收劳协在重庆的全部机构。开封、西安、桂林、汉口等地的劳协福利工作也被迫停止。这时，反动政府对劳协施尽了威胁恐吓的手段，强迫劳协发表反共宣言，强迫劳协排除解放区工会于劳协组织之外，但是被劳协坚决地拒绝了。在这种情形下，劳协在国民党统治区的公开存在已经是不可能了，劳协总会就迁移香港，劳协的工作方式，就由公开转为秘密。“合法”转为“非法”，继续为人民民主革命和工人的自由权利而奋斗。这时一部分劳协分子，如水祥云、安辅庭等背叛了劳协，出卖了工人群众的利益。最近水祥云还在台湾活动，要参加所谓“亚洲工会联合会”，充当美帝国主义的走狗，对于这种无耻的行为，我们要予以坚决的反对。
    历史的事实证明：中国工人阶级只有在自己的先锋队——中国共产党，自己的领袖——毛主席的领导下，才能够得到真正的解放。劳协同志认识了这个真理。在一九四八年，劳协与解放区职工联合总会筹备会，以及国民党统治区其他民主工会共同发起召开第六次全国劳动大会，通过关于中国职工运动当前任务的决议，恢复中华全国总工会的组织。劳协就成为全国总工会领导下的一个团体。全国工人大团结了。劳协从一九三八年以来，高举着全国工人阶级团结统一的旗帜，坚持着全国工人阶级的联合斗争，抗拒了国民党反动派无数次的分裂阴谋，到今天，这个全国工人的团结统一才完全实现了。
    从去年八月以来，国内时局有了重大的发展，人民解放战争已经取得了伟大的胜利，象征全国人民大团结的人民政治协商会议已经胜利闭幕，中华人民共和国与中央人民政府业已诞生，全国的完全解放也为期不远了。帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义及其中的代表者国民党反动政府对中国人民的罪恶统治，已被推翻。由于上海、南京、汉口、广州等大城市的解放，全国工运的情势也有了重大的发展。
    在今天，劳协可以说已经完成了它的历史任务，劳协工作的目的是反帝、反封建、反官僚资本、是要求真正的民主，要求自由的工会，要求全国工人阶级的团结统一。现在，由于人民解放战争获得了伟大的辉煌的胜利，由于全国人民一致拥护的中央人民政府的成立。由于人民民主专政的坚决的实行，由于中华全国总工会在一年多以来的壮大发展，劳协的要求已经完完全全地实现了。同时，由于全国工人阶级必须在产业的基础上组织起来，才能在即将到来的经济建设高潮中，担负起重大的责任。劳协不是产业性的组织，已不适合于今天的工会组织原则，所以，劳协已无保存原来组织的必要了。劳协与全总目前已到达了需要“组织统一”的阶段了。在这次会议上，我们要决定结束劳协的组织，劳协的会员应该依照全总的组织系统，参加各地各种产业工会的组织。劳协的干部要诚心诚意接受全国总工会的领导，共同为谋求工人阶级的利益而努力。劳协的组织虽然结束了，可是劳协同志要在全国总工会的领导下参加建设新中国的工作却方才开始，所以加在我们身上的责任是更重了。我们在过去犯过一些错误，我们自己要加以检讨。我们要虚心学习马、列主义的革命理论，学习毛泽东思想，学习苏联的建国经验，来不断提高自己的政治水平。我们要坚决接受中国共产党和毛主席的领导，将革命进行到底，努力新民主主义的政治经济文化建设，把农业的中国，变为工业的中国，由新民主主义社会，稳步地逐渐地向着社会主义、共产主义社会走去。我们要坚决遵照毛主席指示我们的一面倒的政策，站在以苏联为首的民主阵营的一方面，击败美英帝国主义鼓动第三次世界大战的阴谋，让帝国主义者在世界人民伟大力量的面前发抖！最后，我们要感谢中国共产党和毛主席的英明果敢的领导，感谢中国人民解放军的英勇无比的作战，我们要向他们致最崇高的敬礼。让我们高呼：
    中国工人阶级的大团结万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
