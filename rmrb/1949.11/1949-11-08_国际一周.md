　　The entire Soviet Union and progressive people around the world joyfully celebrate the October Revolution
    All people who support democracy and progress around the world are joyfully preparing to celebrate the 32nd anniversary of the Great October Revolution in the Soviet Union. Within the Soviet Union, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union issued commemorative slogans on the 1st, calling on working people around the world to unite all forces and fight for lasting peace and the security of all countries, and summoning the Soviet people to advance selflessly towards the highest ideal of mankind—the victory of communism. The socialist competition to greet the October Revolution Day is being universally launched throughout the Soviet Union. Almost all employees in Moscow's enterprises have poured into the competition, guaranteeing to complete this year's plan before the festival and have already reached and exceeded the 1950 production level stipulated in the Five-Year Plan. Mass movements such as increasing production speed, improving production quality, saving raw materials, reducing costs, and completing and exceeding grain delivery plans ahead of schedule have reached a new upsurge in all Soviet enterprises, factories, and state-owned and collective farms. In ten sectors of Moscow industry, 9,000 work teams have all produced high-quality finished products. Moscow industry has saved 450 million rubles in eight months by accelerating the turnover of working capital. Textile workers in the Ivanovo region saved 8 million tons of cotton and 1,600 tons of yarn this year, and used these saved raw materials to produce 27 million meters of fabric.
    This year, the Soviet people are greeting the October Revolution Day with an even more vigorous national economic life. According to a recent communique issued by the Central Statistical Bureau of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, the total industrial output of the Soviet Union in the third quarter of this year has completed 102 percent of the plan, an increase of 17 percent over the same quarter last year. Progress is also continuing in agriculture. This year's grain harvest has greatly increased compared with last year and has exceeded the pre-war level of 1940. On the basis of the thriving national economy, the Soviet working people are living an increasingly happy and fulfilling life. As a result of the substantial increase in people's income, retail trade of Soviet state and cooperative societies in the third quarter of this year has increased by 18 percent compared with the same quarter last year. Leningrad's largest "Traveling" department store sold 8 million rubles more goods in the third quarter of this year than in the same quarter last year. Twenty-five food stores in Leningrad sold 50 percent more butter, sugar, and eggs, 17 percent more meat, and 14 percent more cheese in the third quarter of this year than in the entire year of last year. The number of sewing machines purchased by rural residents this year is four and a half times that of 1947, and the number of bicycles and motorcycles is twice that of 1947.
　　In contrast to the thriving Soviet economy, the economic crisis in the United States and Britain is even more serious
    However, in the capitalist countries in another corner of the world, there is an absolutely opposite picture. The prospect of a crisis-ridden capitalist system giving way to a thriving socialist system is becoming increasingly clear. The British dollar crisis has deepened. By the end of September this year, the total reserves of gold and dollars in the United Kingdom, even calculated at the old exchange rate of one pound to the dollar before devaluation, were only 351 million pounds. The devaluation of the pound implemented by the Labor government under the orders of its American masters originally fantasized about stimulating the export of British goods and the inflow of dollars, but now even Cripps has to admit: "The results will be very slim." At the same time, the devaluation of the pound has led to soaring prices and severe inflation, which has sharply increased the cost of living for working people by 10 percent. The British ruling class is currently stepping up its offensive against the working people to ease the increasingly serious economic crisis. The Labor government insists on implementing the wage freeze policy, continuing to extend working hours and increase labor intensity. British Prime Minister Attlee announced a so-called "saving plan" on October 24, cutting the ordinary budget by 250 million pounds this year, mainly cutting investment, social welfare funds, and food subsidies, which will lead to increased unemployment, further impoverishment of people's lives, and further price increases. The "saving" of 70 million pounds in the construction industry, according to the Daily Express, will leave 125,000 construction workers unemployed. According to British Deputy Prime Minister Morrison at the end of last month, the Labor government is planning a new "saving" plan to attack the working people. The British ruling group's reactionary policy of relying on US imperialism and harming the broad masses of the British people has aroused widespread opposition from the broad strata of the British people, making the domestic class struggle increasingly serious. The economic situation in the United States is also continuing to deteriorate. Due to the strike of more than one million steel and coal miners, especially the sharp increase in unemployment and the greater impoverishment of the broad masses of the people, the domestic market has been further reduced. According to the US Federal Reserve Board, in the week ending October 22, department store sales decreased by 14 percent compared with the same period last year. The Associated Press reported that in the same week, every industrial sector in the United States reduced production separately. This news agency of the American capital group said sadly: "The United States seems to be entering the most serious economic crisis in history."
    The American and world progressive people have won a major victory in the struggle against the US imperialists' shameful verdict against the leaders of the American Communist Party. In the face of the strong wave of protests around the world, the US Court of Appeals was forced to change Judge Medina's original ruling refusing bail on the 13th, and agreed to bail out the eleven leaders of the American Communist Party before the higher court accepts the appeal.
　　The World Peace Congress has expelled Tito's representatives, and the anti-Tito struggle in southern countries is sharp
    The Second Plenary Session of the Standing Committee of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace closed in Rome on October 31. The plenary session issued a declaration, exposing the various conspiracies of the US and British reactionaries and their lackeys to prepare for aggressive wars, and pointed out with full confidence that the growing forces of peace have sufficient power to subvert the plans of the warmongers. The declaration called on peace organizations in various countries to use all methods to force those governments that obey the will of the war criminals to accept the demands of guaranteeing peace. The plenary session endorsed the resolution of the Executive Bureau of the Standing Committee on October 18 to refuse the Yugoslav Peace Committee to participate in the Rome meeting, and further decided to expel the representatives of the Tito group from the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress. This resolution undoubtedly dealt a heavy blow to the warmongers headed by US imperialism. Their attempt to use the representatives of the Tito group, who wore the mask of "peace," to carry out sabotage within the peace camp has suffered a shameful failure. The Tito group, which is employed by US imperialism as a pawn, is now not only completely isolated internationally, but also faces increasing opposition domestically. According to the editor of the Forward newspaper, the organ of the Yugoslav communists exiled in Bulgaria, recently stated that after the first batch of underground organizations of Yugoslav communists loyal to internationalism were established in Belgrade and Montenegro, they are now beginning to expand to Serbia, Bosnia, and other industrial centers, and have launched activities in the army. According to a report in the Bulgarian Communist Party Worker's Affairs newspaper, the Yugoslav working people have adopted various forms of struggle, from strikes to open conflicts with the secret police, to oppose the Tito group.
　　Resolutely oppose Hatta's treasonous acts, and the Indonesian guerrillas are actively active
    The so-called Dutch-Indonesian Round Table Conference, which began in The Hague on August 23, ended on November 2. Under the direct command of the American representative Cochran, this conference has finally completely turned Indonesia into a colony of US and Dutch imperialism. The traitorous face of the Hatta group, the representative of the Indonesian reactionary bourgeoisie, can no longer be concealed by any means. The conference adopted and announced the provisional constitution of the so-called "United States of Indonesia," stipulating the establishment of the "United States of Indonesia" under the rule of the Dutch monarch, including the "Republic of Indonesia" and the various puppet states established by the Netherlands. Many other agreements reached by the conference stipulated that all Dutch colonial institutions in Batavia and other cities should be completely transferred to the government institutions of the United States of Indonesia, thus preserving the Dutch colonial administration within the "United States of Indonesia," and the agreement fully retained Dutch control over Indonesia's military diplomacy and other aspects. It must be pointed out here that the real owner of the "United States of Indonesia" is not the Netherlands, but the US imperialists. The Netherlands itself is only the executor of the will of US imperialism; at the same time, the United States can directly do whatever it wants in Indonesia through its Hatta puppet group.
    However, the Indonesian people, who would rather become white bones than suffer humiliation, cannot tolerate the great humiliation given by the Hague Round Table Conference. The people's guerrillas active in Java and Sumatra have recently actively mobilized to attack Dutch colonists. Parts of the government army in Java, controlled by the Hatta group, have also refused to carry out the orders of the Hatta government and continue the anti-Dutch war.

　　国际一周
  　全苏联及世界进步人们  欢欣鼓舞庆祝十月革命
    全世界一切拥护民主和进步的人们，正欢欣鼓舞地筹备庆祝苏联伟大的十月革命三十二周年。在苏联国内，苏联共产党中央委员会一日发布了纪念口号，号召全世界劳动人民团结一切力量，为持久和平与各国安全而斗争，召唤苏联人民奋不顾身地向人类的最高理想——共产主义的胜利前进。迎接十月革命节的社会主义竞赛，正在全苏普遍展开。莫斯科各企业中的几乎全体职工，都涌入竞赛热潮，他们保证在节前完成今年计划，他们并已达到和超过五年计划所规定的一九五○年生产水平。提高生产速度、提高生产质量、节约原料、减低成本、提前完成和超过纳粮计划等群众性运动，已在全苏各企业、各工厂、各国营和集体农场中，达到了新的高涨。在莫斯科工业的十个部门中，已有九千个工作队全部制造品质精美的成品。莫斯科工业由于加速了流动资金的周转，在八个月内即已节省了四亿五千万卢布。伊凡诺夫州的纺织工人今年节省了八百万吨棉花和一千六百吨纱，并用这些节约的原料生产了二千七百万公尺织物。
    今年，苏联人民是在国家经济生活更加高涨的情况下迎接十月革命节的。根据苏联部长会议中央统计局最近发布的公报，指出苏联全部工业总产量在今年第三季已完成了计划的百分之一○二，较去年同季增加了百分之十七。在农业方面也在继续前进。今年谷物收获量比去年大为增加，并已超过了战前一九四○年水平。在整个国家经济蒸蒸日上的基础上，苏联劳动人民正过着愈来愈幸福和美满的生活。由于人民收入的大大提高的结果，今年第三季苏联国家与合作社的零售贸易，已较去年同季增加了百分之十八。列宁格勒城最大的“行旅”百货商店，今年第三季比去年同季多销货物八百万卢布。列城二十五家食品店，今年第三季就比去年全年多卖出百分之五十的奶油、糖和鸡蛋，百分之十七的肉和百分之十四的乳酪。今年乡村居民所购买的缝纫机，为一九四七年的四倍半，脚踏车与摩托脚踏车则为一九四七年的两倍。
　　与苏联经济蒸蒸日上相反美英经济危机更严重
    但在世界另一角落的资本主义各国内，却呈现出一幅绝对相反的景象。危机重重的资本主义制度必须让位给欣欣向荣的社会主义制度的前景，是愈来愈分明了。英国的美元危机更加深重了。到今年九月底，英国黄金与美元的全部储备，即使以贬值前一英镑与美元的旧比价计算，也仅有三亿五千一百万镑。工党政府奉美国主人之命实行的英镑贬值，原来还幻想借此刺激一下英国货的输出与美元的流入，但现在连克利浦斯也不得不承认：“结果将十分渺茫。”同时英镑贬值却招来了物价暴涨和恶劣的通货膨胀，使劳动人民的生活费用陡增百分之十。英国统治阶级目前正在加紧向劳动人民的进攻，来缓和日趋严重的经济危机。工党政府坚持推行冻结工资政策、继续延长工时和提高劳动强度，英国首相艾德礼于上月二十四日宣布了所谓“节约计划”，把今年的普通预算削减二亿五千万镑，其中主要被削减的是投资、社会福利经费和粮食补贴等预算，这就将招致失业的增加，人民生活的更趋贫困和物价的进一步上升。建筑工业中七千万英镑的“节约”，据每日快报估计，将使十二万五千建筑工人失业。据英国副首相莫里逊上月底透露：工党政府又在策划向劳动人民进攻的新的“节约”计划。英国统治集团所奉行的投靠美帝国主义和违害英国广大人民的反动政策，引起了英国广大阶层人民的普遍反对，使国内的阶级斗争日益严重。美国经济情况也在继续恶化中。由于一百余万钢铁与煤矿工人的罢工，尤其是失业者的猛增与广大人民的更加贫困，进一步缩小了国内市场。据美国联邦准备局估计，到十月二十二日为止的一周内，百货公司的售货量较去年同期降低了百分之十四。美联社报道在同一周内，美国每一工业部门均分别减产，这个美国资本集团的通讯社并悲哀地说：“美国似乎是要进入历史上最严重的一次经济危机了。”
    美国和全世界进步人民，在反对美帝国主义对美共领袖可耻判决的斗争中，已赢得了第一回合的重大胜利。美国上诉法庭在全世界强大的抗议浪潮面前，被迫于十三日改变了法官麦迪纳拒绝保释的原判，答应在更高级法庭受理十一位美共领袖上诉以前，得保释美共领袖出狱。
　　和大已逐出铁托代表  南国反铁托斗争尖锐
    世界拥护和平大会常设委员会第二届全会，已于上月三十一日在罗马闭幕。全会发表宣言，揭露美英反动派及其走狗进行侵略战争准备的各种阴谋活动，并充满信心地指出：正在成长的和平势力，有充分力量颠覆战争贩子的计划。宣言号召各国和平组织使用一切方法，迫使那些顺从战贩意志的政府接受保证和平的要求。全会拥护常委会执行局十月十八日拒绝南斯拉夫和平委员会参加罗马会议的决议，并进一步决议把这一铁托集团的代表驱逐出和大常委会以外。这一决议无疑给了以美帝国主义为首的战争贩子以沉重打击，它们利用这个带上“和平”假面具的铁托集团的代表在和平阵营内部进行破坏勾当的图谋，已遭受了可耻的失败。为美帝国主义雇用的走卒铁托集团，现在不仅在国际上已完全陷于孤立，而且在国内也遭受愈来愈大的反对。据流亡保国的南斯拉夫共产党人机关报前进报编辑最近谈称：南斯拉夫国内忠实国际主义的共产党人的第一批地下组织，在贝尔格莱德和门的内哥罗建立后，现开始扩大到塞尔维亚、波希尼亚及其他工业中心，并已在军队中展开活动。另据保国共产党工人事业报报道，南斯拉夫劳动人民采取了各种各样的斗争形式，从罢工直到和秘密警察的公开冲突，来反对铁托集团。
　　坚决反对哈达卖国勾当  印尼游击队正积极活动
    自八月二十三日在海牙开始的所谓荷印圆桌会议，已于十一月二日结束。在美国代表柯契伦直接指挥下的这个会议，已使印尼最后完全地变成了美荷帝国主义的殖民地。印尼反动资产阶级的代表哈达集团的卖国贼面貌，从此再不能用任何方法加以遮掩了。会议通过和宣布了所谓“印尼合众国”临时宪法，规定成立在荷皇统辖下的“印尼合众国”，其中包括“印尼共和国”与荷兰所建立的各个傀儡邦。会议达到的其他许多协议，规定在巴达维亚及其他城市的全部荷兰殖民机构，完全移交给印尼合众国的政府机构，因而保存了荷兰在“印尼合众国”内的殖民地行政，协议并充分保留了荷兰对印尼的军事外交等方面的控制。这里必须指出：“印尼合众国”的实际主人并不是荷兰，而是美帝国主义者，荷兰本身不过是美帝国主义意志的执行者；同时美国还可直接经过其哈达傀儡集团在印尼为所欲为。
    但是，“宁可变成白骨、决不遭受白眼”的印尼人民，决不能忍受海牙圆桌会议所给予的奇耻大辱。在爪哇与苏门答腊活动的人民游击队，最近曾积极出动，袭击荷兰殖民者，哈达集团控制的爪哇，部分政府军，也拒绝执行哈达政府的命令，继续进行反荷战争。
