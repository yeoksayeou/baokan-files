　　Seeing the Demise of Old China from the "Imperial and Empress Life Exhibition Room"

  　　　　　I. "One Meal for the Emperor and Empress, Half a Year's Grain for a Farmer."
    In the south section of the Palace Museum, there are two very educational exhibition rooms: one is about the life of the Qing Dynasty emperors and empresses, and the other is about the revolutionary historical materials of the Qing Dynasty. Here, I will only talk about some impressions of the former, which can be regarded as an introduction.
    The exhibition room not only displays the real objects, photos, and various archives of the emperors and empresses' lives (including clothing, food, housing, transportation, etc.), but also displays various daily necessities of the farmers. Looking at the two side by side, it is a clear and strong contrast! This cannot but deeply move the visitors; this will prevent the visitors from just "appreciating" without any meaning.
    "One meal for the emperor and empress, half a year's grain for a farmer." That is not wrong at all. Please see the following shocking statistics:
    1. For the funeral of Min Ning (Daoguang Emperor), the sacrificial ceremony alone used 15,328 lamas and monks, and 10,270 cooks.
    2. The tomb of the Nara clan (Empress Dowager Cixi) was built for a total of thirty-five years. The interior engineering was not completed until after the death of the Nara clan. The first year of construction cost 1.2 million taels of silver, equivalent to 60 million catties of millet, enough for the annual living expenses of 200,000 farmers. This is only the first year. If multiplied by thirty-five, what a large number that would be!
    3. The pots, bowls, ladles, and spoons in the "Imperial Kitchen" were all made of gold and silver. Gold utensils reached 1,245 taels, equivalent to 9,961 taels of silver. Adding the silver utensils, the total was 16,876 taels of silver.
    4. The Nara clan (Empress Dowager Cixi) often had more than 150 kinds of food. For "porridge" alone, more than 50 kinds were prepared every day, and each meal cost 100 taels of silver. The consumption per meal was equivalent to 5,000 catties of millet, enough for the daily life of more than 5,000 farmers.
    5. According to statistics of only seven items, the clothes, bedding, and other items worn and used by the emperors and empresses amounted to more than 1,342 taels of silver, equivalent to 67,103 catties of millet, enough for the daily life of more than 70,000 farmers.
    6. The Nara clan (Empress Dowager Cixi) spent a total of 4,386,204 taels of silver on her sixtieth birthday, equivalent to 218,291,390 catties of millet, enough for the annual living expenses of 700,000 farmers.
    Look everyone! Just a few items, this is such a large extravagant consumption. And the source of these consumptions is also clearly displayed there: payments from various provinces, offerings from Li Hongzhang, offerings from Yuan Shikai... countless lists. Naturally, the offerings from Li, Yuan, etc., were given by their subordinates and officials from various provinces, circuits, prefectures, states, and counties; and the offerings from the officials were given by the landlords; the offerings from the landlords came directly from the exploitation of the peasants. It was such a system of layer-by-layer exploitation that the feudal ruling class relied on to squeeze and exploit the peasants for a long time.
    Let's look at the other side of the exhibition room to see what the lives of the peasants were like? It was tattered clothes and hats; it was bran and chaff; it was flour made from tree bark and grass roots! The working people had no land, no food, and no clothes; the non-working people instead occupied the land, lived such a luxurious life, and regarded themselves as masters. This is the true situation of the feudal exploiting class and the exploited class; this is the reason why thousands of peasant uprisings broke out in history.
    The driving force for the development of Chinese history for thousands of years was not the personal activities of emperors, kings, generals, and ministers, but the struggle of peasants and other independent producers against the feudal ruling class. Therefore, the real masters of history are definitely not those emperors and empresses who lived a luxurious life, but precisely those working people who wore tattered clothes and ate bran and chaff.
    　　　　II. The Final Demise of the Rulers of Old China
    After the Xinhai Revolution, although the Qing Dynasty emperor abdicated, the succeeding feudal warlord rule, compared with the Qing Dynasty emperors and empresses, although different in name, was the same in its essence of harming the country and the people; its luxurious life was no less than that of the emperors and empresses. Especially after Chiang Kai-shek betrayed the Great Revolution in 1927, the rule of the four major families headed by Chiang Kai-shek brought unprecedented disasters to the Chinese people in history. This is why some viewers said after seeing it, "The sinful lives of the four major families should also be displayed."
    However, whether it is the Manchu Qing emperors and empresses, or the new-style feudal comprador dynasty—the four major families—this era has passed. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people have overthrown the last rulers of old China—the dynasty of the four major families headed by Chiang Kai-shek; they have established their own country, a people's country led by the proletariat and based on the worker-peasant alliance. In this country, everything is premised on the interests of the people, and the wealth of this country belongs to the people. Everything is taken from the people and used for the people. Therefore, the Chinese people will no longer suffer the pain of past feudal exploitation. Although the long-term suffering left to the Chinese people by internal and external reactionaries prevents the people's lives from being rapidly and universally improved, we believe that under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Communist Party, and the People's Government, and with the warm help of the great socialist country of the Soviet Union, we will quickly heal the wounds left to us by the past ruling class. Chairman Mao told us: "As long as we still maintain the style of hard struggle, as long as we are united, as long as we adhere to the people's democratic dictatorship and unite international friends, we will quickly achieve victory on the economic front." "The unyielding efforts of the Chinese people will steadily achieve their goals." The Chinese people, growing up in this great era, facing these displays of tragic history, will further increase their hatred for their enemies, further increase their love for their people and their motherland, and increase their infinite confidence and strength.
    Of course, there may still be some people in the past who "built their happiness on the pain of others," who still miss that "emperor and empress" style of life, who still miss that "four major families" style of life, and who are still dreaming of "restoration." However, this dream will ultimately only be a dream. This dream will also be sent to the museum along with history.

　　从“帝后生活陈列室”看旧中国的灭亡
　　彭明
  　　　　　一、“帝后一席饭，农民半年粮。”
    故宫博物院的南路，有两个很有教育意义的陈列室：一个是关于清代帝后的生活；一个是关于清代的革命史料。这里仅就前者谈一点观感，也算是一点介绍。
    陈列室不仅陈列了帝后生活（包括衣、食、住、行等）的实物、照片、及各种档案，而且陈列了农民的各种生活用品，瞻彼顾此，真是一个鲜明强烈的对照！这就使参观者不能不深受感动；这就使参观者不会再是一种毫无意义的“欣赏”了。
    “帝后一席饭，农民半年粮。”那是一点没有错的，请看下列几个惊人的统计：
    一、旻宁（道光）丧仪，仅致祭一项用喇嘛和尚一万五千三百二十八人；厨役一万零二百七十人。
    二、那拉氏（西太后）的坟墓，前后共修三十五年，直到那拉氏死后，内部工程才完竣。其修建的第一年即费去白银一百二十万两，折合小米六千万斤，足够二十万农民全年的生活费。这仅是头一年，如果以三十五倍之，那该是多么大的数目！
    三、“帝后御膳房”里的锅、碗、瓢、勺等物，全系金银所制。金器达一千二百四十五两，合白银九千九百六十一两，加上银器，共合白银一万六千八百七十六两。
    四、那拉氏（西太后）经常食品有一百五十品之多，仅“粥”一项，每日必备五十余种，每顿饭要用银一百两。其每餐消耗折小米五千斤，够五千多农民一天生活。
    五、帝后所穿所用的衣服被褥等物，仅根据七件的统计，即达白银一千三百四十二两多，折合小米六万七千一百零三斤，够七万多农民一天的生活。
    六、那拉氏（西太后）六十岁生日，共消耗白银四百三十八万六千二百零四两，折合小米二万一千八百二十九万一千三百九十斤，足够七十万农民全年的生活费。
    大家看吧！仅仅几项，这是多么大的奢侈消耗。而这些消耗的来源，那里也陈列的清楚：各省的缴纳、李鸿章的献奉、袁世凯的献奉……数不清的清单。自然，李、袁等的献奉，又是他们的部下及各省、道、府、州、县的官吏献给的；而官吏的献奉又是地主献给的；地主的献奉则是直接剥削农民而来的。就是这样一套层层剥削的机构，封建的统治阶级就是靠了这个机构，长期的压榨剥削农民。
    再从陈列室的另一边来看看，农民的生活是怎样的呢？那是破衣、破帽；那是麸子、糠秕；那是树皮草根磨成的面呵！劳动的人没有土地、没有饭吃、没有衣穿；不劳动的人反而占有土地、反而如此奢侈豪华、反而以主子自居。这就是封建剥削阶级与被剥削阶级的真实的情况；这就是在历史上为什么会爆发数千百次农民起义的原因。
    成为几千年来中国历史发展的动力的，决不是帝、王、将、相的个人活动，而是农民及其他独立生产者对封建统治阶级的斗争。因此真正历史的主人，决不是那些过着奢侈豪华生活的帝后，而正是那些穿破衣、吃糠秕的劳动人民。
    　　　　二、旧中国统治者的最后灭亡
    辛亥革命以后，满清皇帝虽然退位了，但继起的封建军阀统治，与满清帝后相较，名义尽管不同，其祸国殃民的本质则一；其生活的奢侈豪华并不下于帝后。尤其是自一九二七年蒋介石叛变大革命后，建立起来的以蒋介石为首的四大家族的统治，则给中国人民带来了历史上空前的大灾难。这就是为什么有的观众在看后说“应该把四大家族的罪恶生活也陈列一下”的理由。
    然而，不管满清帝后也好，不管封建买办的新式王朝——四大家族也好，这种时代已经过去了。中国人民在毛主席和中国共产党的领导之下，已经推翻了旧中国的最后统治者——以蒋介石为首的四大家族王朝；已经建立起以无产阶级为领导的以工农联盟为基础的人民自己的国家。这个国家，一切以人民利益为前提，这个国家的财富属于人民。一切取之于民，用之于民。因此，中国人民再也不会受到过去封建剥削的痛苦了。虽然由于内外反动派长期遗留给中国人民的苦难，使人民生活还不能迅速普遍的得到改善。但是我们相信在毛主席在共产党及人民政府的领导之下，在伟大的社会主义国家苏联的热诚帮助之下，我们会很快医好过去统治阶级所遗留给我们的创伤。毛主席告诉我们：“只要我们仍然保持艰苦奋斗的作风，只要我们团结一致，只要我们坚持人民民主专政和团结国际友人，我们就能在经济战线上迅速地获得胜利”“中国人民的不屈不挠的努力必将稳步地达到自己的目的”。生长在这伟大时代的中国人民，面对着这些悲惨历史的陈列，就更增加了对于自己的敌人的仇恨，就更增加了对于自己的人民的祖国的热爱，增加了无限的信心和力量。
    当然，还可能有一些过去“把自己的幸福建筑在别人痛苦的基础上”的人们，还眷恋着那“帝后”式的生活，还眷恋着“四大家族”式的生活，还在作着“复辟”的好梦，然而，这梦也究竟只能是梦了。这梦也将会随同历史一样送到博物馆里去了。
