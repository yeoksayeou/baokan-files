Xinhua News Agency, Tashkent dispatch: The Soviet people are unyieldingly transforming nature in the former Aral-Kyzyl-Kum desert within Uzbekistan. Reclamation workers have received the task of afforesting one million hectares of desert land within a few years. This work is already being carried out on a large scale this autumn. In the near future, afforestation will begin on tens of millions of hectares of desert land.

Vast agricultural forest belts are protecting the fertile lands of Bukhara and Kara-Kum from the encroachment of the Kyzyl-Kum shifting sands. Large-scale well-digging is underway in Kyzyl-Kum, as a result of which three million hectares of desert land have been reclaimed as pastureland in this year alone. New villages have sprung up near the newly dug wells, and agriculture has begun to develop on the desert land. Currently, thousands of hectares of land are being plowed with tractors and sown with winter grains. With the help of scientists and agronomists, farmers have learned to harvest abundant barley and wheat in the desert without irrigation.

The Soviet deserts are being transformed into densely populated oases, and this remarkable change will be seen every year from now on.

　　苏联变沙漠为绿洲
  　库米沙漠上正大规模造林掘井
    一年内已垦出三百万公顷牧地
    【新华社北京十五日电】塔斯社塔什干讯：苏联人民正不屈不挠地在乌兹贝克境内的前阿瑞德·克齐尔·库米沙漠中改造自然。改良家们已接到了在几年内在沙漠地造林一百万公顷的任务。今秋这种工作已在大规模地进行。不久的将来千万公顷的沙漠地上都要开始植林。
    巨大的农田森林防护带已在保护着布哈拉与加拉·库米两大片沃壤免受克齐尔·库米流沙的侵害。在克齐尔·库米正在大规模地进行掘井工作，因此，仅在今年一年中就使三百万公顷的沙漠地被开垦为牧地。新的村落在新掘的水井附近出现了，农业开始在沙漠的土地上发展起来。现在，数以千公顷计的土地在用拖拉机耕犁并播下冬季谷物。依靠科学家和农业学家的帮助，农民们已经学会了不用浇水而使沙漠中的大麦小麦丰收。
    苏联的沙漠正在变为人烟稠密的绿洲，今后每年都要看到这种值得注意的变化。
