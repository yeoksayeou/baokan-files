Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 10th: The three provinces of Shanxi, Hebei, and Pingyuan have successively held youth work conferences, determining the guidelines and tasks for the youth movement this winter and next spring. In the nine months since the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued the resolution to establish the Communist Youth League on January 1st of this year, the work of establishing the League in the aforementioned provinces has achieved considerable success. Shanxi Province already has more than 50,000 League members; Hebei Province already has 5,631 branches and 105,314 League members; Pingyuan Province already has more than 1,200 branches and more than 21,000 League members. They have played a significant promoting and leading role in production and construction, supporting the front lines, learning, and restoring factories, railways, and land reform in newly liberated cities and regions, becoming a powerful assistant to the People's Government and the Chinese Communist Party in promoting various tasks. However, in the work of establishing the Communist Youth League in various provinces, there are still tendencies towards varying degrees of closed-doorism or formalism that merely pursues numbers, and within the Communist Youth League organizations there are serious phenomena of unsound systems and a lack of ideological education. These situations hinder the further development and consolidation of the Communist Youth League organizations. In order to overcome these shortcomings and according to the needs of national construction, the aforementioned provinces have held youth work conferences, deciding on the guidelines and tasks for the youth movement this winter and next spring. The Shanxi Province conference decided to focus on mobilizing and organizing the broad masses of young people to participate in industrial and agricultural production and the land reform movement in new areas, and to pay universal attention to political, cultural, and technical education. The conferences in Hebei and Pingyuan provinces decided to consolidate existing organizations and steadily and substantially develop League members, making League members the core and backbone for the People's Government to mobilize the masses to complete various tasks. In order to ensure the implementation of the conference guidelines, Shanxi Province decided to improve the regular working system of the Communist Youth League, overcome the bureaucratic work style of the leading organs, stipulate that the organizations of the Communist Youth League at all levels should promptly check and summarize work, establish a leadership style of timely guidance and education, strengthen the theoretical and professional study of cadres, train a large number of youth work cadres at the county, district, and village levels, and gradually convene congresses of the Communist Youth League at all levels to formally establish leadership organizations. Pingyuan Province decided to allocate county-level League committees in one-half of the counties, district-level League committees in one-third to one-half of the districts, and continuously cultivate, promote, and replenish cadres at all levels.

    晋冀平原开青年工作会议
    确定青运方针
    发动青年参加生产、土改加强教育，巩固发展组织
    【新华社北京十日电】山西、河北、平原三省先后召开青年工作会议，确定了今冬明春青年运动的方针与任务。自今年一月一日中共中央发布建立青年团的决议以来的九个月中，上述各省的建团工作已获得相当成绩。山西省已有五万余团员；河北省已有五千六百三十一个支部，十万五千三百一十四个团员；平原省已有一千二百余个支部，二万一千余个团员。他们在生产建设、支援前线、学习与在新解放城市与地区恢复工厂、铁路及土地改革中，起了很大的推动和带头作用，成为人民政府和中国共产党推行各种工作的有力助手。但各省建立青年团工作中，仍存在着程度不同的关门主义或单纯追求数字的形式主义倾向，在青年团组织内部则存在着制度不健全、缺乏思想教育的严重现象。这些情况障碍了青年团组织的进一步发展和巩固。为着克服这些缺点，并根据全国建设需要，上述各省都召开了青年工作会议，决定了今冬明春青年运动方针和任务。山西省的会议决定着重发动组织广大青年群众参加工农业生产及新区土地改革运动，并普遍注意政治、文化和技术教育。河北、平原两省的会议都决定巩固现有组织，并稳步而大量地发展团员，使团员为人民政府发动群众完成各项任务的核心和骨干。为着保证会议方针的贯彻执行，山西省决定健全青年团的正规工作制度，克服领导机关的事务主义作风，规定各级青年团的组织要及时检查和总结工作，建立及时指导教育的领导作风，加强干部的理论和业务学习，大量训练县、区、村级青年工作干部，并逐步召开各级青年团代表大会，正式成立领导组织。平原省决定在二分之一的县份配备县团委，三分之一至二分之一的地区配备区团委，并不断培养提拔充实各级干部。
