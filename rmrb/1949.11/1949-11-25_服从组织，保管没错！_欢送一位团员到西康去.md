　　"Obey the Organization, There's Absolutely No Mistake!"
　　——Farewell to a League Member Going to Xikang
　　Dù Líjūn
　　The walls were covered with red and green farewell slogans: "Farewell Comrade Yang Shuqin's Victorious Advance to Southwest China!" "Obeying Organizational Assignments is a Noble Revolutionary Quality!" "We Must Emulate Comrade Yang Shuqin!" This farewell meeting was organized by our group and the student committee of the First Class of the Education Department of the Second Branch of North China University. In addition to all the students in our class, all the branch committee members of the Education Department's Youth League branch and representatives from other class League groups attended.
　　Comrade Yang Shuqin walked onto the stage amidst prolonged applause.
　　"Comrades!" she said with a smile, her face a little red, as if she felt uneasy due to excitement. "I want to take the revolutionary enthusiasm of the comrades to Xikang, to work!" She excitedly talked about the process and feelings of this work assignment, and she used a metaphor to explain the meaning of "obeying organizational assignments": "We are like screws, some thick, some thin, some long, some short, and the revolutionary cause is like a big machine. Which hole is suitable for placing the screw in the big machine? Only the organization knows, and the organization will certainly study it, even more carefully than we study it ourselves, so, obeying the organization, there's absolutely no mistake! The organization will put the screws in the most needed, most useful, and most appropriate places, so that the revolutionary machine will exert even greater power!" Finally, she emphasized even more: "I will always obey the organization, rely on the masses, and complete the tasks assigned to us by the Party! Today, I want to be a good League member, and tomorrow, I want to strive to be a glorious Bolshevik!" Her words merged with the excited applause.
　　During the "free discussion" session, one student said very moved: "When I heard the news that she was being transferred to work in Xikang, I thought: If I were Yang Shuqin, I definitely wouldn't go. Xikang is too far away, and I also have family difficulties! In fact, after careful analysis, the root of my thinking is not that I dislike Xikang being too far away, and my family is not really a difficulty at all, it's just my shield! I don't want to go because Xikang is too remote and the living conditions are too harsh. This view is completely dominated by individualistic views of fame, position, and enjoyment! Comrade Yang Shuqin's exemplary actions have educated me. When my professional studies are over and work is assigned, I will definitely not bargain with the organization, and I will definitely obey the assignment and go to the place where the revolution needs me most!"
　　Another student pointed to the portrait of Chairman Mao and said: "In front of the people's leader, I want to swear: Wherever the organization assigns me, I will go! Because now I have deeply realized that the issue of obeying organizational assignments is the issue of the relationship between the individual and the revolution. Obeying the organization is obeying the revolution. This is the most basic revolutionary quality that a revolutionary worker must possess!"
　　The secretary of the Education Department's Youth League branch said: "Comrade Yang Shuqin's ability to unconditionally obey organizational assignments shows that the education of Hua University and the Youth League has played a significant role in her! Yang Shuqin is a role model for our Youth League members.... In the Soviet film 'The Village Teacher,' there was a line: 'May the Siberian cold wind not destroy your will.' Now, I pass this sentence on to you, hoping that you persist in the struggle against the 'cold wind,' and I hope you will always remember Stalin's words: 'There is no fortress that a Bolshevik cannot break through!'"
　　At this meeting, the students all stood up to expose their own erroneous thoughts and publicly guaranteed to everyone: "Obey organizational assignments!" "Emulate Comrade Yang Shuqin!" — In this way, our farewell meeting reached a climax of political enthusiasm for "obeying the organization" from the meaning of farewell.
　　We will never forget this meeting, never forget the high level of political enthusiasm and the solemn guarantee of "obeying organizational assignments" at this meeting. This meeting encouraged and educated us. We will study harder and be ready to go to the place where the revolution needs us most at any time. Comrade Yang Shuqin has marched into Xikang, and we repeat in our hearts a popular saying on campus: "Wherever our cadres go, there will be liberation!"

### “服从组织，保管没错！”——欢送一位团员到西康去

　　“服从组织，保管没错！”
　　——欢送一位团员到西康去
　　杜黎均
    墙壁上贴满了红红绿绿的欢送标语：“欢送杨述勤同志向大西南胜利进军!”“服从组织分配是高尚的革命品质！”“我们要向杨述勤同志看齐！”这个欢送会是由我们——华北大学二部教育系第一班团的小组及学委会组织的，到会的除了我们全班的同学外，尚有教育系团支部全体支委及其他各班团小组代表。
    杨述勤同志在长久的掌声中走上了主席台。
    “同志们！”她微笑地说，脸有些发红，好象因激动而感到不安。“我要把同志们这样的革命热情带到西康去，带到工作中去！”她兴奋地谈着这次分配工作的经过和感想，她用了一个比喻来说明“服从组织分配”的意义：“咱们好比螺丝钉，有粗，有细，有长，有短，革命事业好比一架大机器。把螺丝钉放在大机器中那一个孔才合适呢？只有组织知道，组织当然要研究，比咱们自己研究得还仔细，所以，服从组织，保管没错！组织会把螺丝钉放在最需要、最有用、最恰当的地方，这样，革命的大机器就会发挥更大的力量！”最后，她更着重地说：“我要永远服从组织，倚靠群众，完成党交给我们的任务！今天，我要作一个好团员，明天，我要争取作一个光荣的布尔塞维克！”她的话与激动的掌声融合在一起了。
    在“自由谈话”的程序中，有一位同学非常感动地说：“当我听到她被调往西康工作的消息时，我这样想：如果我是杨述勤，我一定不去，西康太远了，况且我还有家庭困难！其实，仔细分析起来我的思想根源，并不是嫌西康太远，我的家庭根本是不成困难的困难，这不过是我的挡箭牌而已！我不愿意去，是因为西康太偏僻，生活条件也太苦。这看法完全是被个人主义的名位观点和享乐观点所支配着的！杨述勤同志的模范行动教育了我，将来业务学习结束，分配工作的时候，我一定不向组织讨价还价，一定服从分配，到革命最需要的地方去！”
    另外一位同学指着毛主席的肖像说：“在人民的领袖面前，我要宣誓：将来组织分配我到那里，我就到那里！因为，现在我已深深认识到：服从组织分配的问题是个人与革命的关系问题，服从组织就是服从革命，这是一个革命工作者必须具备的最起码的革命品质！”
    教育系团支部书记同志说：“杨述勤同志能够毫无条件地服从组织分配，说明了华大和团对她的教育起了很大的作用！杨述勤就是我们青年团员的榜样……。在苏联影片乡下女教师中，曾有这样的话：希望西伯利亚的寒风，不会摧毁了你的意志。现在，我把这句话转送给你，希望你坚持对‘寒风’的斗争，更希望你永远记着斯大林的话：没有一个布尔塞维克所攻不破的堡垒！”
    在这个会上，同学们都纷纷站起来暴露了自己的错误思想，并且公开向大家保证：“服从组织分配！”“向杨述勤同志看齐！”——这样，我们的欢送会就由欢送的意义达到“服从组织”的政治热情的高潮。
    我们将永远不能忘记这个会，永远不能忘记这个会上的高度政治热情和对“服从组织分配”的庄严保证，这个会鼓励并教育了我们，我们将更加紧学习，随时准备着到革命最需要的地方去。杨述勤同志向西康进军了，我们在内心里重复着校内流行的一句话：“我们的干部到那里，那里就解放！”
