    After Liberation, Workers Actively Produce
    Pingxiang Coal Mine's Output Increases Greatly
    [This Newspaper's Report] The workers of the nationally renowned Pingxiang Coal Mine resolutely carried out the struggle against evacuation and sabotage by Kuomintang bandits before liberation, preserving all the mine's assets. After liberation, they strengthened unity, assisted in the takeover, and actively engaged in production. The mine produced 727.8 tons of coal in June before liberation (the mine was liberated on July 23rd). By July, the output was 940 tons, August produced 3,000 tons, and in September, it increased to over 5,200 tons. In the past, when workers mined coal, wall rock and coal were mixed together. Now, coal workers separate the wall rock and coal, so the quality of the coal has also improved. Regarding the use of raw materials, workers used to break up the wood used in the mine and burn it as firewood. Now, this phenomenon not only no longer exists, but they also carefully consider the use of wood according to its size and quality.
    The management system of the mine has also improved since liberation. The cruel exploitation of the contractor system was abolished, and some local bullies and ruffians, as well as bad elements who relied on the power of Kuomintang reactionaries to oppress workers and live off exploitation, were eliminated. Recently, the workers also organized a trade union and a workers' security corps to protect the mine.
    The mine has two mining areas, Gaokeng and Anyuan. The coal produced can supply the Zhe-Gan Railway, Yue-Han Railway, Ping-Han Railway, and the Central China Iron and Steel Company. The entire mine has 3,152 workers. It is estimated that the coal reserves in the two mining areas, excluding what has already been mined, are still 64 million tons. In the past, the Anyuan mining area was the main area, but because of its poor coal quality, Gaokeng has been used as the main mining area in recent years. The mine began to be taken over on August 1st and was successfully completed on August 12th.

### 解放后工人积极生产  萍乡煤矿产量大增

    解放后工人积极生产
    萍乡煤矿产量大增
    【本报讯】全国闻名的萍乡煤矿工人，解放前曾向国民党匪徒坚决进行了反疏散、反破坏的斗争，保存了矿山的全部资财，解放后又加强团结协助接管，积极生产。该矿解放前六月份产煤七二七点八吨（该矿系七月二十三日解放），至七月份产量为九百四十吨，八月产三千吨，九月份则增至五千二百余吨。过去工人挖煤时，壁石与煤均混在一起，现在煤工将壁石与煤分成两处，所以煤质也提高了。使用原料上，过去工人往往将矿上用的木料劈碎当柴烧，现在这种现象不但没有了，而且还按木料的大小、好坏斟酌使用。
    矿厂管理制度方面，解放后亦有改善。开始将包工头制度的残酷剥削取消，清除了过去的一些地痞流氓及倚仗国民党反动派的势力欺压工人靠剥削吃闲饭的坏分子。最近工人又组织了工会和工人纠察队保护矿山。
    该矿共有高坑、安源两个矿区，煤产可供应浙赣路、粤汉路、平汉路、华中钢铁公司的使用，全矿共有工人三千一百五十二人，据估计两矿区的储煤量除已开采者，尚有六千四百万吨。过去以安源矿区为主，因其煤质不良，故近年又以高坑作为主要矿区。该矿于八月一日开始接管，八月十二日顺利完成。
