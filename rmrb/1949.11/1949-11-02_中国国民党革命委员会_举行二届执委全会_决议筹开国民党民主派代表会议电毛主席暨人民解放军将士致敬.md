　　[By Our Staff Reporter] The Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, in order to realize the unity of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang (RCCK), the Three People's Principles Comrades Association (TPPPA), and the Kuomintang Democratic Promotion Society (KMTDPS) from the spiritual level to the actual unity in name, organization, and work, and further to seek the general unity of all Kuomintang democrats under the people's regime, so as to devote themselves to consolidating and expanding the people's democratic united front and realizing the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), held the second plenary session of the Central Executive Committee on the 29th of last month at the meeting place at No. 9 Donghuangchenggen. More than 40 central executive and supervisory committee members attended the meeting, including Li Jishen, He Xiangning, Tan Pingshan, Cai Tingkai, Chen Mingshu, Jiang Guangnai, Li Xijiu, Chen Shaoxian, Li Renren, Zhu Yunshan, Chen Qiyuan, Zhu Xuefan, Chen Rutang, Wang Kunlun, Mei Gongbin, Guo Chuntao, Xu Baoju, Chen Cisheng, Yu Xinqing, Li Shizhang, and Lü Jiyi. Li Jishen, He Xiangning, Tan Pingshan, Chen Mingshu, and Cai Tingkai were elected to form the presidium. The morning agenda consisted of work reports from the central committees and offices, and explanations of proposals, with Li Jishen, He Xiangning, and Cai Tingkai serving as executive chairmen. The afternoon session involved discussions of the proposals, with Chen Mingshu, Jiang Guangnai, and Tan Pingshan serving as executive chairmen. The meeting began at 9:00 a.m., starting with an opening speech by Chairman Li Jishen, the gist of which was: (1) The great Chinese People's Revolution, under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao of the Chinese Communist Party, has achieved brilliant victories with the victory of the People's Liberation War, the convening of the CPPCC, the birth of the People's Republic, and the establishment of the People's Government. The new China of the people has since entered the stage of New Democratic construction, which is also the stage where the revolutionary Three People's Principles must be further developed and converge with New Democracy. We must not be complacent and should fully utilize Mr. Sun Yat-sen's spirit of understanding the times, continuous effort, and continuous progress, and mobilize all members and Kuomintang democrats nationwide to strive for the construction of a New Democratic New China under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao; (2) In order to carry out the above-mentioned revolutionary tasks, we must expand and strengthen the unity of the Kuomintang democrats. We must not only further unify the TPPPA and KMTDPS, which have already been united under the RCCK's political program, into one organization, but we must also unite all Kuomintang democrats into a unified organization to work together and struggle together. In order to achieve this progressive unity, the RCCK, KMTDPS, and TPPPA have long been negotiating the unification process. The proposal to launch a representative meeting of Kuomintang democrats, which the Standing Committee is submitting to the Second Plenary Session today, is the result of multiple consultations. After the speech, committee members Mei Gongbin, Lü Jiyi, Zhu Xuefan, Chen Rutang, Chen Shaoxian, Zhu Yunshan, and Li Minxin respectively reported on the work of the Standing Committee, the Secretariat, and the four committees: Organization, Propaganda, Political Affairs, and Finance. Subsequently, committee members Tan Pingshan and Gan Zhenying respectively reported on the draft political tasks and the draft organizational points submitted by the Standing Committee for discussion at the plenary session.
　　After the reports, the meeting continued after a one-hour break. Executive Chairman Chen Mingshu presided over the discussion of the current political tasks, and Jiang Guangnai presided over the discussion of the organizational points. After the two proposals were revised and passed, Tan Pingshan presided over the discussion of the proposals to hold a regular representative meeting of Kuomintang democrats and to re-elect the Central Standing Committee and various departments of the Central Committee. After Chairman Chen Cisheng was instructed to give a summary explanation, a lively discussion ensued, and the following resolutions were made: (1) In order to achieve the goals of solidarity, unity, and progress among Kuomintang democrats, a representative meeting including the RCCK, TPPPA, KMTDPS, and Kuomintang democrats from outside these three organizations should be planned to be convened within two weeks, and negotiations should be immediately initiated with representatives of Kuomintang democrats outside the three organizations, with a view to the early establishment of a preparatory body including Kuomintang democrats from all four areas; (2) Since the representative meeting of Kuomintang democrats is scheduled to be convened, the current Central Standing Committee and various departments of the Central Committee of this association should maintain the status quo temporarily and need not be re-elected. After the discussion, the chairman made a temporary motion to send a telegram to Chairman Mao and the officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army to express their respects, which was unanimously approved by the entire audience. The meeting concluded successfully at 7:00 p.m.
　　[Further News] The telegrams of respect to Chairman Mao and the People's Liberation Army are as follows:
