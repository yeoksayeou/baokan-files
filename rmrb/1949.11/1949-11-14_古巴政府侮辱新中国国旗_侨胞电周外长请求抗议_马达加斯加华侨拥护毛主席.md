Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 13th: The incident of Cuban police arresting patriotic overseas Chinese Liang Puhang and insulting the Chinese national flag during the Double Tenth Festival this year has aroused the indignation of overseas Chinese in Cuba. Lu Gezi, Chairman of the General Cadre of the Cuban Overseas Chinese Supporting Democratic Unity League, cabled our Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai on October 15th, requesting a protest to the Cuban government. Qualified sources here believe that if the Cuban government does not stop this act of suppressing our overseas Chinese who support the patriotic democratic movement, it must bear direct responsibility for this matter. Lu Gezi's telegram to Minister Zhou stated: This league is organized by overseas Chinese in Cuba and has been striving for the democratic political movement for more than 20 years without any slackening. Recently, in order to cooperate with the victory of the people's revolution in the motherland, on October 10th, we held a celebration meeting for the establishment of the People's Government and officially raised the national flag of the People's Republic of China to awaken overseas Chinese and international figures to the recognition of the new democratic China. Unexpectedly, Kuomintang reactionary agents Jiang Weisheng, Li Yichu, etc., bribed local hooligans to destroy our league and colluded with the Fourth Police District of Havana Province, Cuba, to forcibly lower our national flag and the banner "Celebrating the Establishment of the People's Government of China" by force, and detained Comrade Liang Puhang, Chairman of the Havana Cadre of our league, and searched the store of Li Juzhi, General Cadre Secretary of our league. Although the person was released afterward, the comrades of our league were extremely indignant at the insult to the national flag and resolved to fight to defend the national flag, sparing no sacrifice, and continue to hold the celebration meeting. This action has won the sympathy of overseas Chinese and international democrats. However, the national flag case has not yet been concluded, and the Havana court has scheduled a hearing on November 25th. The hanging of the national flag (along with the Cuban national flag) had been studied in advance with lawyers and various parties, and there was no violation of international law. Overseas Chinese democratic groups in Britain and the United States all raised the new national flag on that day. This move by the Cuban authorities clearly violates international practice and infringes on the dignity of the national flag of the People's Republic of China. Therefore, before this case is tried in court, we hereby submit to your ministry, earnestly requesting that you file a protest with the Cuban authorities in accordance with the law to safeguard the dignity of our national flag and grant assistance to our league. This would be a great kindness.
Cuban Overseas Chinese Supporting Democratic Unity League, General Cadre Chairman, Lu Gezi, October 15th, 1949.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 12th: The Madagascar Overseas Chinese Democratic Progressive Association cabled Chairman Mao at the beginning of last month, expressing warm support for the Central People's Government. The telegram is as follows:
Beijing Central People's Government, Chairman Mao, Your Excellency:
We are delighted to hear that the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference has successfully concluded, and the People's Republic of China was formally proclaimed on October 1st. We are overjoyed to hear that you have been elected Chairman of the Central People's Government. Your Excellency led the revolution, established the people's armed forces, destroyed the reactionary forces of the Kuomintang Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang who betrayed the revolution, and thoroughly eliminated the bureaucratic capital of the remaining Chiang, Chen, Kong, and Song families, so that the people of the whole country have been liberated and entered the road of democracy. Although we are living overseas, we feel infinitely excited about the rebirth of our motherland. We are willing to lead all overseas Chinese to wholeheartedly support the Central People's Government, and under Your Excellency's leadership, work together to build a new democratic China and complete the revolutionary mission.
We respectfully present this telegram and express our sincere support. We respectfully wish Chairman Mao good health and wish the motherland prosperous and strong under the leadership of Chairman Mao! Long live the People's Republic of China!

    古巴政府侮辱新中国国旗
    侨胞电周外长请求抗议
    马达加斯加华侨拥护毛主席
    【新华社北京十三日电】哈瓦那讯：古巴警察于今年双十节逮捕我爱国侨胞梁普航并侮辱我国国旗一事，已引起古巴侨胞的愤激。古巴华侨拥护民主大同盟总干部主席吕戈子特于十月十五日致电我外交部长周恩来，请求向古巴政府提出抗议。此间有资格人士认为：古巴政府如不制止此种压迫我侨胞拥护祖国民主运动的行为，必须对此事负直接责任。吕戈子致周部长电内称：本盟为旅古巴华侨所组织，已历有二十余年，努力民主政治运动，迄未稍弛。近为配合祖国人民革命胜利，于十月十日举行庆祝人民政府成立大会，并正式悬竖中华人民共和国国旗，借以唤起侨胞及国际人士对新民主主义中国的认识。讵料国民党反动特务蒋伟生、李逸初等，收买当地流氓，捣毁本盟，并勾结古巴哈瓦那省会第四警区，以武力将我国旗及“庆祝中华人民政府成立”的横额强行降下，并将本盟哈瓦那干部主席梁普航同志拘捕，及搜查本盟总干部秘书李矩芝的商店。虽事后随即将人释放，但本盟同志以国旗受辱，异常愤激，决作维护国旗斗争，不惜任何牺牲，继续召开庆祝大会。这一行动已赢得侨胞及国际民主人士的同情。但国旗案情则尚未了结，哈瓦那法庭已定期十一月二十五日开庭审讯。查悬挂国旗（与古巴国旗并悬），事前已与律师及各方面研究，于国际法并无不合。旅英美华侨民主团体于该日均悬挂新国旗。古巴当局这一举动显然违反国际惯例，侵犯我中华人民共和国国旗的尊严。故于本案未在法庭审判之前，特呈钧部恳予据法向古巴当局提出抗议，以维护我国旗的尊严及赐予本盟以援助，实为德便。古巴华侨拥护民主大同盟总干部主席吕戈子一九四九十月十五日。
    【新华社北京十二日电】马达加斯加华侨民主协进会于上月初致电毛主席，表示热烈拥护中央人民政府。电文如下：北京中央人民政府毛主席钧鉴：
    欣闻中国人民政治协商会议圆满闭幕，中华人民共和国于十月一日正式宣告成立，我公当选为中央人民政府主席。远道闻讯，无任欢跃。我公领导革命，建立人民武力，摧毁背叛革命之国民党蒋介石匪帮反动势力，并彻底消灭残余之蒋陈孔宋之官僚资本，使全国人民，获得解放，步入民主大道。侨等虽寄身海外，对于祖国之新生，感到无限兴奋。愿率同全体侨胞竭诚拥护中央人民政府，在我公领导下，共同努力，建设新民主主义之新中国，完成革命使命。敬肃，代电奉达，并表拥护之诚。敬祝毛主席健康，并颂毛主席领导下之祖国繁荣和强盛！中华人民共和国万岁！
