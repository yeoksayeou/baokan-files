    Beijing Suburbs Emphasize Youth Work
    Integrating Land Reform to Carry Out National Construction
    [Beijing News] The Beijing suburbs are carrying out Communist Youth League construction work in conjunction with land reform. Since the beginning of land reform, forty youth cadres from the suburbs have participated in various land reform work teams to carry out Communist Youth League construction work in a focused and step-by-step manner. During the land reform, the young peasants showed the greatest enthusiasm, and a large number of young activists emerged, playing a promoting and leading role. For example, young peasants in Zhouzhuang, Guo Gongzhuang, Shuanghuaishu in the western suburbs of the 15th district have spontaneously organized to monitor the landlords' covert sabotage activities and prevent the landlords' illegal smuggling and private sales. During the land reform, the young peasants' awareness has been rapidly raised. At a meeting of more than 200 young peasants in Balizhuang in the eastern suburbs, 28 young peasants voluntarily applied to join the Communist Youth League. More than ten people in Kandancun in the 15th district have applied to join the League, hoping to build a free and happy new countryside under the leadership of the Communist Youth League. One month of work experience has proven that the work team that emphasizes youth work mobilizes the youth well, and the land reform work is also more active.

    京郊重视青年工作
    结合土改开展建国
    【北京讯】北京市郊区在土地改革中开展建团工作。自土地改革开始后，郊区青年干部四十人参加各土地改革工作组，进行有重点、有步骤的建团工作。在土地改革中，青年农民热情最高，涌现大批青年积极分子，起了推动与带头的作用。如十五区周庄、郭龚庄、西郊双槐树等村青年农民都自动组织起来，监视地主的暗中破坏活动，防止地主的非法偷运、私卖。在土地改革中，青年农民觉悟迅速提高，东郊八里庄二百余人的青年农民大会上，有二十八个青年农民自动申请加入青年团，十五区看丹村已有十余人申请入团，他们希望在青年团的领导下，建设起自由幸福的新农村。一个月的工作经验证明：那一个工作组重视青年工作，那一个村的青年就发动得好，土地改革工作也表现得活跃。
