Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 7th: Since the former North China People's Government issued instructions on October 15th to widely launch the Winter School Movement and the "1949 Winter School Movement Implementation Outline," most provinces and regions in North China have begun preparations for winter school. The Hebei Provincial People's Government instructed all counties on October 22nd that every administrative village in the province, except for severely disaster-stricken areas, should run winter schools, striving to enroll approximately 60 percent of young adults. Anping County in the province began training teachers at the end of October, reviewing and summarizing last year's winter school experiences. The Suiyuan Provincial Government decided that all counties should universally establish winter schools, focusing on publicizing policies such as rent reduction and interest rate reduction, suppressing bandits, and agricultural burdens, as well as current affairs education, to cooperate with work in the new areas. Winter school preparations in Shanxi Province are now largely complete. The Xingxian and Yicheng Prefectural Offices have drafted winter school work plans and are preparing to provide appropriate training for winter school teachers. Zuoquan (Liaoxian) and Jiaocheng have also specifically formulated winter school education curricula and progress schedules. Jiangxian has begun training teachers. Winter schools in various counties of Pingyuan Province will generally begin classes in early November, with some villages in Hua County, Wuzhi, Yanggu and other counties having already started classes.
