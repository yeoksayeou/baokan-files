Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 5th. The Chinese Youth Delegation, including Xiao Hua, Han Tianshi, and Chen Jiakang, departed for Moscow on the evening of the 4th after an eight-day visit to Poland to attend the celebration of the 32nd anniversary of the October Revolution, the greatest festival of mankind.

At 7:00 PM on the afternoon of the 3rd, Polish Premier Cyrankiewicz received the Chinese Youth Delegation at the Polish government office, expressing his great joy at the victory of the Chinese Revolution and providing detailed answers to the delegation's questions regarding Polish economic construction. He stated that Poland had already completed its post-war Three-Year Plan (from 1947 to December 1949) ahead of schedule, with production in some economic sectors exceeding pre-war levels. Over one million workers had been added to the workforce, and wages and living standards of workers had generally improved. The Six-Year Economic Plan, to be implemented in 1950, would further lay the foundation for socialist construction.

During their stay in Poland, the Chinese Youth Delegation, in addition to visiting the arduous project of rebuilding Warsaw, also visited Lodz, Wroclaw, the Polish industrial centers of Siebritz and Katowice, and the famous Baltic port of Danzig, where they witnessed the Polish people rebuilding factories and houses extensively destroyed by German fascists and restoring economic production with great spirit. They also paid tribute to the relics of the Polish people's heroic anti-German struggle and the immortal achievements of the great Soviet Red Army in helping the Polish people's liberation war. The delegation received a grand welcome from the Polish people everywhere they went, with streets in many places adorned with portraits of Chairman Mao and huge maps showing the situation of the Chinese Liberation War.

  　我青年代表团离波赴苏
    留波期间受到波兰人民盛大欢迎
    【新华社布拉克五日电】中国青年代表团萧华、韩天石、陈家康等一行，在波兰参观八日后，已于四日晚启程赴莫斯科，参加人类最伟大的节日——十月革命节三十二周年的庆祝大会。
    三日下午七时，波兰部长会议主席西伦凯维兹在波政府办公室接见中国青年代表团，对中国革命的胜利，表示非常喜悦，并对代表团所提出的关于波兰经济建设等问题，作了详细的解答。他说，目前波兰已提前完成战后三年计划（自一九四七年起到一九四九年十二月止），部分经济部门的生产已超过战前水准，工人增加了一百余万，工资和工人生活已普遍提高。行将于一九五零年开始实行的六年经济计划，将更进一步打下社会主义建设的基础。
    中国青年代表团在留波期间，除参观重建华沙城的艰巨工程外，并曾赴罗兹、罗克劳和波工业中心塞布司、卡多维兹及波罗的海著名港口但泽市等地访问，到处看到波兰人民正以巨大的气魄，重建为德国法西斯所大规模破坏的工厂房屋，恢复经济生产。他们并瞻仰了波兰人民英勇抗德斗争的遗迹和伟大苏联红军在帮助波兰人民解放战争中的不朽功绩。代表团到处受到波兰人民的盛大欢迎，许多地方的街道上都高挂着毛主席像和中国解放战争形势的巨幅地图。
