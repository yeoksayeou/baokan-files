　　Over a Thousand Prostitutes Begin New Lives
    Actively Organizing Study to Reform Thinking
　　Brothel Owners, Madams, etc. Have Been Centrally Investigated and Dealt With
    [Beijing News] The 1,268 prostitutes from 224 brothels in Beijing were, before 5:00 AM yesterday morning, settled into eight locations at the Hanjiatan and Baishun Hutong Women's Production and Education Institute, beginning their new lives after liberation. Currently, each location houses between 130 and 140 prostitutes, gathered from various districts, and they receive the same treatment as general staff. On the evening of November 21st, over 2,400 cadres from the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Civil Affairs Bureau, Health Bureau, Municipal Women's Federation, and soldiers from the Public Security Corps worked tirelessly through the night. The Municipal Public Security Bureau also organized an action command center, and sub-command centers were established in the five public security bureaus with a higher concentration of prostitutes: Outer 2, Outer 3, and Outer 5. In addition, 27 work groups and 37 vehicles were organized to close brothels and concentrate prostitutes in various districts. When closing brothels, all the property of the prostitutes was returned to them, and they were allowed to take their daily necessities with them during the gathering. All the property of the brothels was confiscated and used to assist the prostitutes. The Municipal Health Bureau also organized a medical team to disinfect each location before the prostitutes were gathered and began treating the prostitutes' illnesses. Currently, under the leadership of cadres assigned by the Municipal Women's Federation and the Civil Affairs Bureau, the prostitutes in each location have begun forming groups to prepare for study and reform their thinking. Some are also organizing cooperatives to address their daily needs. All 483 brothel owners and madams have been concentrated at the Public Security Bureau, and are currently being investigated and dealt with in accordance with the spirit of the resolutions of the Representatives of All Circles Conference. A small number of die-hard bad elements with egregious crimes who refuse to confess will be punished according to the law. The patrons, tea servers, and pimps arrested along with the prostitutes were given education and released on bail starting yesterday. During this operation of concentrating prostitutes and closing brothels, cadres and soldiers were able to implement policies and strictly abide by discipline. As a result, some prostitutes initially understood the People's Government's policy of reforming prostitutes through on-the-spot explanations and persuasion. Prostitutes from Outer 1 sang songs such as "Without the Communist Party, There Would Be No New China" and "The Sky in the Liberated Area" in the cars during the gathering to celebrate their liberation. Yao Shuzhen, a prostitute from Outer 4, said, "Everything you say is good. From today on, we are clean people."
    Another said: In the past, no one would bury us when we died; now that we are liberated, we can eat by labor and have a way out. Wang Zhigui, a prostitute from Outer 5, said, "Being a prostitute can't last a lifetime! Sooner or later, we have to leave." Wang Xiuqing, a prostitute from Chunhua Courtyard, said, "I will go wherever they tell me to go. The government is concentrating us to make us learn to be good." She also mobilized other prostitutes to pack their luggage during the gathering. The remnants of the barbaric system that has plagued women in Beijing for thousands of years were eradicated in one fell swoop within twelve hours of the resolution of the Second Beijing Municipal People's Representatives Conference. Many citizens felt relieved. A pancake seller in Outer 1 said, "There have been prostitutes since ancient times, and now they are all gone at once. The People's Government's method is really wonderful. Not allowing prostitution and 'patronizing brothels' is to teach people to be good."

　　千余妓女开始新生活
    正组织学习改造思想
　　妓院老板领家等已集中审查处理
    【北京讯】北京市二百二十四家妓院的妓女一千二百六十八人，已于昨晨五时前，分别安顿在韩家潭和百顺胡同妇女生产教养院的八个所中，开始过着解放后的新生活。现在每个所中分别住着从各区集中来的妓女一百三、四十人不等，吃的和一般工作人员待遇同样。二十一日晚，市公安局、民政局、卫生局、市妇联等单位的干部和公安总队的战士们二千四百余人，澈夜紧张地工作，市公安局并组织了行动指挥部，并在外二、外三、外五等妓女较多的五个公安局另设分指挥部。此外，还组织了二十七个工作组及三十七辆汽车，分别到各地区进行封闭妓院、集中妓女的工作。在封闭妓院时，除妓女的财产全部归其本人所有，并于集中时，已由其本人将日用必需品各自携带外，对妓院的财产，则全部没收，作为救济妓女之用。市卫生局还组织了一个医疗队，在妓女集中之先，即将各所分别消毒，并开始为妓女们治病。现在各所中的妓女，在市妇联、民政局所配备的干部的领导下，有的已开始分组，准备学习，改造思想。有的还进行组织合作社，以解决她们日常生活用品上的需要。妓院老板和领家四百八十三名，已全部集中于公安局，现正依据各界代表会议决议的精神，分别审查处理中，对少数罪大恶极不肯低头认罪的坏分子，将依法惩处。与妓女集中同时查获的嫖客和茶役、跟妈等，已于昨日起分别教育后取保释放。在此次集中妓女、封闭妓院的工作中，干部与战士均能执行政策，严守纪律，因此，有的妓女就在当场的解释和说服下，初步了解了人民政府改造妓女的政策，外一区的妓女于集中时坐在汽车上唱着“没有共产党就没有新中国”和“解放区的天”等歌曲，庆祝自己的解放。外四区妓女姚淑珍说：“你们说的全都是好话，由今天起我们就是一个干净人了。”
    另一个说：过去死了都没人埋；现在解放了，劳动吃饭，有出路了。外五区妓女王芝桂表示：“当妓女不能混一辈子啊！早晚要走。”春花院妓女王秀清说：“叫我到那里我就到那里，政府集中我们是叫我们学好”。她在集中时还动员其他妓女打行李。北京几千年来摧残妇女的野蛮制度的残余，在京市第二届各界人民代表会议决议后十二小时内一举肃清了。许多市民都感觉痛快。外一区一个卖烧饼的说：“自古以来就有妓女，现在一下取消了。人民政府办法真妙，不许当妓女‘嫖窑子’，是叫人学好。”
