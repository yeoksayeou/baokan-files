　　Mentougou Hongshun and Siwei Private Coal Mines
　　Reasonably Resolve Labor Disputes
    Workers' Enthusiasm Increases, and Production Increases
    [Beijing News] The Hongshun and Siwei private mechanized coal mines in Mentougou, Beijing, experienced labor disputes in July this year. After mediation by the Beijing Municipal Labor Bureau, an agreement was reached on August 27. In order to understand the implementation of the agreement by both labor and management of the two mines, the Labor Bureau recently sent cadres to conduct inspections, listen to the opinions of both parties, and learn about their reactions after the Labor Bureau mediated the dispute. The inspection results showed that both labor and management basically implemented the agreement and were very satisfied with the Labor Bureau's mediation. Due to the greatly increased enthusiasm of workers, the management gradually changed its passive attitude, and production increased by more than 25% compared to before. The two mines originally had more than 300 employees, and now have increased to 420. A large reservoir has also been built, which is sufficient for the two mines to use. With the strong assistance of all workers, the mine is now actively opening up the Beishimen, repairing the vertical shaft, and creating a workers' clinic and club. In addition, the mine launched a project on October 1st to modify the electric locomotives that transport coal. The original plan was to complete it in half a month, but thanks to the active efforts of the workers, it was completed in ten days. The original 65-horsepower electric locomotive, which could only pull one coal car, was modified to 75 horsepower, which can pull two cars. Forty-two technicians were rewarded by the mine for this.
    At the beginning of the labor dispute agreement in the two mines, some workers felt that the mediation result, which reduced wages by 10%, meant that the Labor Bureau only supported the management's demands, so some people said at the time: "The lawsuit was lost." After two months of study, the workers realized that "they should not only care about earning more wages, but also think about whether the management can make money"; at the beginning of the mediation, the management also adopted a wait-and-see attitude. Later, seeing that the union earnestly educated the workers, the workers were enthusiastic about production and cared for the machines, they gradually changed their view of pursuing profits solely from workers' wages. Manager Hu Xianzhou said: "The Labor Bureau's patient mediation based on policies can really solve problems!" Now both labor and management are eager to sign a collective contract to thoroughly solve some specific labor-management issues that still exist, so that both parties can concentrate on developing production.

　　门头沟宏顺、四维两私营煤矿
　　合理解决劳资纠纷
    工人积极性提高产量增加
    【北京讯】本市门头沟宏顺、四维两个私营机采煤矿，今年七月间曾发生劳资纠纷，经北京市劳动局调解，于八月二十七日获得协议。劳动局为了解两矿劳资双方对协议的执行情况，特于日前派干部前往进行检查工作，并分别听取双方意见，和对劳动局调解这一纠纷后的反映。检查结果：劳资双方基本上均按照协议执行，对劳动局的调解都很满意。由于工人生产热情大大提高，资方逐渐改变了消极态度，产量较前增加了百分之廿五以上。两矿原有职工三百余人，现在已增加到四百廿人。并增建了一个大储水池，足够两矿使用。在全体工人大力的协助下，矿方现正积极开辟北石门，修理立井，创建工人医疗所和俱乐部。此外，矿方于十月一日发动工人改装运煤的电力机，原计划半个月能完成，但由于工人们的积极努力，在十天内就全部完工，把原来只能挂一个车出煤的六十五马力电力机改装成七十五马力，可挂双车出煤。为此有四十二个技工受到矿方的奖励。
    两矿劳资纠纷成立协议之初，一部分工人觉得调解结果，减去工资百分之十，认为劳动局只支持资方的要求，所以在当时有人说：“官司打输了”。经过两个月来的学习，工人们认识到“不应该只管自己多赚工资就好，也要想想资方是不是有钱可赚”；资方在调解之初也是抱着观望的态度，后来看见工会认真教育工人，工人生产积极，爱护机器，这才渐渐改变了单从工人工资上去追求利润的观点。经理胡先洲说：“劳动局根据政策耐心调解，真能解决问题！”现在劳资双方都迫切要求订立集体合同，彻底解决目前仍然存在的一些劳资间的具体问题，以便双方安心发展生产。
