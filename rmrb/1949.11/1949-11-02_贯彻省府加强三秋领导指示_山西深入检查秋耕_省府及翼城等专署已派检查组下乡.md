    [News from this newspaper] In order to implement the September directive on strengthening the leadership of the "Three Autumn Tasks" (autumn harvesting, autumn plowing, and wheat planting), the people's governments at all levels in Shanxi Province have successively organized "Three Autumn Tasks" inspection teams to go deep into the countryside to inspect autumn harvesting, autumn plowing, and wheat planting. The Provincial Government has already sent inspection teams to the countryside. The Yicheng Special District and five counties including Yicheng, Fushan, Yuanqu, Anze, and Jiangxian have selected 124 cadres to form 32 inspection teams. Ren Yinglun, Deputy Commissioner of Changzhi Special District, led five inspection teams, all of which have gone to the countryside to understand the situation and solve problems, with a time frame of about ten to twenty days. The following urgent problems were discovered during this inspection: (1) Focusing only on preparing for winter work and neglecting leadership over autumn cultivation. Autumn cultivation in the Fenyang and Xin County Special Districts has fallen into a state of laissez-faire, and some counties have not even read the Provincial Government's instructions. (2) Due to heavy autumn rains, there was insufficient assessment of the situation, and the attempt to divide the tasks into autumn harvesting and wheat planting before autumn cultivation will inevitably lead to the failure of autumn cultivation due to ground frost. For example, autumn cultivation in Yu County has not yet been fully launched. (3) Because land ownership in the new areas has not been determined, the failure to promptly resolve the ideological concerns of the masses has affected autumn cultivation in some areas.

　　贯彻省府加强三秋领导指示
  　山西深入检查秋耕
    省府及翼城等专署已派检查组下乡
    【本报讯】山西省各级人民政府，为贯彻执行九月关于加强三秋领导的指示，先后组织了三秋检查组，深入农村检查秋收、秋耕、种麦工作。省府于日前已派检查组下乡。翼城专署及翼城、浮山、垣曲、安泽、绛县等五县已抽调了一百二十四个干部，组成三十二个检查组，长治专署副专员任映仑等率领的五个检查组，均已下乡了解情况，解决问题，时间约十天至二十天。在这次检查中，发现了以下几个急待解决的问题。（一）只顾准备冬季工作，忽视了秋耕领导。汾阳、忻县两专区的秋耕陷于自流，个别县甚至连省府的指示竟未看过。（二）因秋雨多，对情况估计不足，企图秋收种麦后再秋耕的分段做法，势必因地冻使秋耕落空。例如盂县秋耕现在还未全面展开。（三）由于新区地权未确定，没有及时的解决群众思想顾虑、影响了部分地区的秋耕。
