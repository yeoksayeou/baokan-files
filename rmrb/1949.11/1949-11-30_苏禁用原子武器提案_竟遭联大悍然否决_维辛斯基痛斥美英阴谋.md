Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 29th: According to a TASS dispatch from New York: The UN General Assembly plenary session on the 23rd discussed the issue of international control of atomic energy. Under the manipulation of the US-British bloc, the plenary session, as in the Special Political Committee, rejected the Soviet proposal to recommend that the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission resume work, immediately draft a convention banning atomic weapons and a convention on the control of atomic energy, and implement both conventions simultaneously. Instead, it adopted the French-Canadian proposal, based on the US-British proposal, advocating that the six permanent members of the Atomic Energy Commission continue fruitless consultations.

    Soviet delegation head Vyshinsky first delivered a long speech, explaining the points of the Soviet proposal in detail and denouncing the sinister aims of the US-British proposal to pursue world hegemony.

    The representatives of the US-British bloc tried to dilute the impact of Vyshinsky's speech, diverting attention with hackneyed slanders against the Soviet Union, but were exposed one by one by representatives of the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies. Czechoslovak delegation head Clementis pointed out in his speech that the US government supported the proposal to establish a super-atomic trust because the US government was convinced that this proposal guaranteed a majority within the trust, just as in all other UN agencies. This trust would be a US espionage agency, guaranteeing it the collection of espionage intelligence in the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies.

    Polish representative Katz-Suchy said: The French-Canadian proposal is only a slightly embellished rehash of the notorious American Baruch Plan, aimed at deadlocking the Atomic Energy Commission. He pointed out that the "will of the majority" expressed during the votes in the Special Political Committee and the General Assembly was not the will of the people. The true majority of millions of people in the Soviet Union, Poland, China, France, the United States, and colonial and semi-colonial peoples, the millions of ordinary people who wholeheartedly yearn for peace, will thwart the war-mongers' aggressive plans and plans to use atomic energy for destruction and instigation of war; atomic energy must and can benefit mankind.

    Belarusian representative Kiselev pointed out that the US ruling clique, regardless of the failure of the discredited Baruch Plan, still insisted on this plan, which seeks to completely monopolize the world's atomic production through some kind of world super-atomic energy trust under the wing of American monopoly capitalists.

    Ukrainian Republic delegation head Manuilsky continued to speak, saying: The purpose of the so-called French-Canadian proposal is obvious, that is, to evade the prohibition of atomic weapons and make them weapons for mass slaughter of peaceful residents in the wars currently being prepared by the US-British ruling bloc. At the same time, the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission is effectively abolished. Therefore, the Canadian and French proposal, which was passed by a majority vote in the Special Political Committee, is a crude violation of the very important resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly on January 24 and December 14, 1946.

    As a result of the vote in the General Assembly, the Canadian-French proposal was passed by forty-nine votes to five. The Anglo-American bloc has thus once again undermined the resolution of the issue of concern to all mankind - the prohibition of atomic weapons and the establishment of effective control.

　　苏禁用原子武器提案
  　竟遭联大悍然否决
  　维辛斯基痛斥美英阴谋
    【新华社北京二十九日电】据塔斯社纽约讯：二十三日联合国大会全体会议讨论了原子能国际管制问题。在美英集团操纵之下，全体会议象在特别政治委员会中一样，否决了建议联合国原子能委员会恢复工作，立即拟订禁止原子武器的公约草案和管制原子能公约草案，并同时实施该两项公约的苏联提案，而通过了以美英提案为底本，主张由原子能委员会六常任委员国继续作无结果协商的法国加拿大提案。
    苏联代表团团长维辛斯基首先发表长篇演说，详细解释苏联提案各点，并痛斥美英提案追求世界霸权的阴险目的。
    美英集团的代表们力图冲淡维辛斯基演说所造成的印象，纷纷以诽谤苏联的陈辞烂调来转移大家的注意，但逐一受到苏联与人民民主国家代表的揭露。捷克代表团团长克里门蒂斯发言指出，美国政府支持成立超级原子托拉斯的建议，是因为美国政府深信这个建议保证了在这个托拉斯内的多数，正象在所有联合国其它机构内一样。这个托拉斯将是美国的间谍机关，保证它在苏联和人民民主国家搜集间谍情报。
    波兰代表纳兹考夫斯基说：法、加堤案只是粉饰了一番的著名的美国巴鲁区计划的再版，目的在于使得原子能委员会陷于僵局。他指出在特别政治委员会和大会上举行表决时所表现的“多数意志”，并不是人民的意志。千百万的苏联、波兰、中国、法国、美国和殖民地与半殖民地人民的真正多数，衷心响往和平的千百万普通人民，将挫败战争贩子的侵略计划和利用原了能从事破坏和挑拨战争的计划；原子能必须而且能够造福人类。
    白俄罗斯代表基塞列夫指出，美国统治集团不管声名狼籍的巴鲁区计划已归失败，仍然坚持着这个计划，这个计划要以某种在美国垄断资本家卵翼下的世界超级原子能托拉斯来完全垄断全世界的原子生产。
    乌克兰共和国代表团团长曼努意斯基继起发言称：所谓法、加提案的目的是显而易见的，那就是规避禁止原子武器，而使之在美英统治集团目前所准备的战争中，充作大规模屠杀和平居民的武器。同时，使联合国原子能委员会实际上被取消。因之，特别政治委员会多数表决的加拿大、法国提案，就是粗鲁地破坏了联合国大会一九四六年一月二十四日及十二月十四日非常重要的决议。
    大会进行表决结果，加拿大、法国提案以四十九票对五票通过。英美集团就这样再一次破坏了全人类所关切的问题——禁止原子武器及建立有效管制问题的解决。
