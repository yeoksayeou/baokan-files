　　A Most Prosperous Department Store
  　A Record of the North China Department Store's Beijing Branch
　　Zheng Zhong
    Wangfujing Street in Beijing was a very luxurious street before liberation, with foreign-style buildings standing side by side, displaying shop names in both Chinese and foreign languages. The shop windows facing the street displayed mannequins in Western suits and leather shoes. Microphones broadcast records, and neon lights blinked. But all of this was prepared for a small number of bureaucratic compradors and had nothing to do with the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. However, since liberation, a department store, exceptionally prosperous and supported by the vast majority of citizens, has emerged. This is the North China Department Store's Beijing Branch.
    Due to excessive customer congestion, the company was forced to move four times: initially from Tizi Hutong to Damo Factory, then back to No. 98 Wangfujing Street, and for the third time to the old site of the former capital's Department Store warehouse on Wangfujing Street. Workers, students, soldiers, government cadres, and ordinary citizens, riding bicycles, walking, taking trams, and even driving cars, gathered here every day from all directions to buy the various items they needed. The flow of people coming in and out often filled the entrance. Two people were specifically in charge of parking bicycles, using more than fifty parking tags, which were often insufficient. In the sales room, more than seventy salespersons were often overwhelmed. Twenty-seven cashiers moved about the room, extremely busy. Every day from 10:00 AM to 7:30 PM, average sales reached 60 to 70 million yuan, with a peak of over 170 million yuan.
    To accommodate the convenience of government employees buying goods, they were open on Sundays and closed on Mondays. A certain factory in the northern part of the city was unaware of this rule. On Monday, September 26th, several workers came excitedly to buy leather shoes. Seeing no one at the entrance from a distance, they felt strange. Only when they approached did they see the "Closed Today" sign. At this time, there were many department stores to the south and north of the company holding "Big Sales," "Major Promotions," "Clearance Sales," "Production and Sales Joint Big Sales," and "Free National Goods for One Day"... but these could not shake their will. After inquiring about the prices and tomorrow's business hours through the door seams, they returned to their factory. Why do people like to buy things here? The following story answers this question: A child in his teens walked to the north entrance of Wangfujing Street and asked a traffic policeman: "Where is the department store?" The policeman casually pointed south and said: "Look, those are all department stores." The child said: "I'm asking about the department store run by the government." The policeman felt strange and asked him: "There are many department stores, why are you specifically looking for the government's department store?" The child replied innocently: "My mom said: They don't cheat children there." This shows that they have gained the trust of the vast majority of customers because they truly implement the commercial ethics of "genuine goods at fair prices, no deception of the old or young."
    At the same time, the company handles more than 360 categories and more than 1,400 kinds of goods, all of which are daily necessities urgently needed by the broad masses of urban and rural people. As the saying goes, "Don't be afraid of not making money, just be afraid of not having a full range of goods." Their goods are not only practical and durable but also diverse, meeting the needs of the public in many ways, which is also one of the main reasons for the business's development.
    In old-fashioned stores, as soon as customers entered, the shop assistants would swarm up and surround you. If you wanted to browse around the store, they would follow closely. If the goods were clearly not good, they would insist on praising them from the sidelines, putting a lot of pressure on the customer, making you feel too embarrassed not to buy something. But buying something! Is it really genuine and fairly priced? There was no certainty. Therefore, after they left, they would never want to visit such a store again, preferring to casually stroll around small stalls. But now, this department store has completely eliminated this bad habit. To facilitate the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, they display samples of various goods in glass display cabinets more than three feet high, with prices clearly marked, so that customers can see them at a glance, saving many procedures. Furthermore, because business is so busy, the shop assistants are only concerned with getting the goods, writing receipts, and counting money, allowing customers to freely walk around, browse, and compare without making pointless promotions. This makes customers feel unconstrained and free to come and go. When they come more often, have a clear idea of what they want, and have money in hand, they immediately go to buy the items they need.
    "Small profits, quick turnover" is their pricing policy. To serve the vast consumers and producers, they adhere to the pricing principle of "production areas lower than sales areas, cities lower than rural areas, and commercial profits lower than industrial profits." The total profit does not exceed 10%, and the profit on popular goods such as matches, alkali noodles, soap, toothbrushes, red and white sugar, and knitted goods, which are needed by most people, is even lower, sometimes only taking the cost without profit. This is something that department stores in the old society never did. Under their influence, other department stores have also reduced their profits. After their price list is published at 8:00 AM every morning, many private merchants and peddlers come to inquire and copy it as a reference for their own pricing. As for the goods in the consignment department, although they are set by the factories themselves, they also mobilize them to serve the vast people with "small profits, quick turnover" like the company.
    The company's source of goods, firstly, comes from public and private factories in the city. Based on the principle of "commerce serving industry," they support industries such as knitting, matches, soap, cigarettes, and rubber. The method is to supply raw materials and purchase finished products or exchange finished products for raw materials. In the past six months (March-August), they supplied raw materials such as cotton yarn, cashmere, red phosphorus, caustic soda, scrap iron, saltpeter, plate paper, sulfurized green, and zinc oxide worth more than 530 million yuan (at that time, millet was around 100 yuan per jin). They purchased the following products: 16,145 boxes of soap, 3,279 boxes of matches, 275,400 packs of cigarettes, 93,452 jin of iron pots, 72,451 dozens of socks, 89,010 dozens of socks, as well as bed sheets, shirts, pigments, notebooks, mosquito net cloth, thread blankets, etc., worth a total of more than 994 million yuan in local currency, equivalent to more than 16.5 million jin of rice. This not only opened up a smooth source of goods but also supported industrial production that benefited the national economy and the people's livelihood, and also developed household sideline occupations, driving a large number of women to participate in production (women account for more than a quarter of knitwear exchangers). In addition, there have been more than 50 factories participating in the consignment department since July, with more than 300 kinds of goods. Factories such as China Hygiene Toothbrush Factory, Dahua Pottery Company, and Chunhe Sporting Goods Company have sold particularly well after participating in the consignment. In August, consignment relationships were established with Qinghe Woolen Mill, Yanjing Paper Mill, and Xinjian Iron Factory, playing a role in supporting production and connecting supply and demand.
    The second source is through material exchanges with friendly neighboring regions. They have actively sent cadres to the Northeast and Northwest friendly neighboring regions to negotiate barter trade contracts and organize material exchanges. Before September, Beijing's knitwear, cigarettes, matches, diaries, etc., were exchanged for Northeast's sugar, soybean oil, Inner Mongolia's camel and sheep wool, and Chahar Province's white hemp, and Shimen's thread blankets. At the end of October, 50,000 dozens of socks, 10,000 dozens of towels, 10,000 sweaters, 2,000 pounds of wool, and 1,100 bolts of sheet fabric were exchanged for a large amount of gasoline, transformer oil, and various types of paper from the Northeast. In addition, they purchased 1,437 boxes of various department store items from Shanghai through the North China Department Store Head Office, and signed a contract with the Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China to jointly purchase industrial raw materials, support industrial production, and regulate various daily necessities. It has played a great role in promoting material exchanges in various regions.

　　一个最繁荣的百货店
  　记华北百货公司北京分公司
　　郑重
    北京的王府井大街，解放前是一条很豪华的街道，林立的洋楼上并列着中、外文字的店名，临街的厨窗内摆列着西服革履的模特儿，麦克风放送着唱片，霓红灯眨着眼睛。但这一切都是为那些少数的官僚买办准备的，和广大的工农兵群众无关。但解放以来却有了一个为广大市民所拥护的异常兴盛的百货商店，这就是华北百货公司北京分公司。
    由于顾客过于拥挤，该公司被迫四次搬家：开始由梯子胡同搬到打磨厂，后又搬回王府井大街九十八号，第三次搬到王府井大街旧都百货总库的旧址。工人、学生、军人、机关干部及市民群众，骑脚踏车的、步行的、坐电车的，甚至乘汽车的，每天都是从四面八方聚拢到这儿来，购买他们需要的各种物品。进进出出的人流，经常挤满门口。两个人专管存车，拿着五十多付车牌，还时常不够使用。在售货室里，七十多个售货员时常应接不暇。二十七个收款员满屋穿行，忙得不可开交。每天从上午十点到下午七点半，平均卖货六、七千万元，最高时达一亿七千余万元。
    他们为了照顾机关职工买货方便，星期日照常营业，星期一休息，北城某工厂不知道这个规定，九月二十六号是星期一，几位工人兴匆匆地来买皮鞋，从远处看到门口没人，很觉奇怪，走到跟前才看见“今日休息”的牌子。这时在该公司的南邻北邻有许多百货店正在举行“大减价”、“大赛卖”、“推销货底”“产销联营大抛售”及“白送国货一天”……但丝毫不能动摇他们的意志，从门缝里问明卖价和明天的营业时间，仍旧奔回了本厂。为什么人们都喜欢到这里来买东西呢？下面的一个故事回答了这个问题：有一个十几岁的小孩子，走到王府井大街北口问交通警察：“百货商店在什么地方？”警察顺手往南一指说：“你看，那些都是百货商店。”孩子说：“我问的是公家开的那个百货商店。”警察觉得很奇怪，就问他道：“百货店很多，为什么单找公家的百货店呢？”孩子很天真的回答说：“我妈妈说：那里不哄小孩。”这说明由于他们真正施行了“货真价实，童叟无欺”的商业道德，所以获得了广大顾客的信赖。
    同时该公司经营的商品共有三百六十余类，一千四百余种货物，而且都是广大城乡群众所急需的日常用品，俗话说：“不怕不赚钱，就怕货不全”，他们的货品不仅朴实耐用，而且种类繁多，从多方面满足大众的需要，亦是业务发展的主要原因之一。
    在旧式商店里，顾客一进门，店员们便蜂拥而上把你团团围住。你要满屋参观，他就随后紧跟，货品明明不好，他偏要在一旁夸奖，给顾客很大的压力，觉得买不点东西太难为情，买吧！到底是否货真价实？没有把握。因之当他们出走来之后，就再也不愿进这种商店观光了，宁愿到小摊子上随便溜溜。而现在，这个百货公司，就完全扫除了这种积习，为了便利广大工农兵群众，他们把各种货物的样品都用三尺多高的玻璃厨柜摆好，上面标明价格，使顾客可以一目了然，省去许多手续；并且由于买卖太忙，店员只顾忙着拿货，开票和点款，一任顾客们随便游走参观，观摩和比较，不作无味的宣传。这样就使顾客感到无拘无束，来去自由，来的多了，目标选好了，等到手中有了钱，马上便去购买他所需要的物品。
    “薄利多销”是他们的价格政策。为了给广大的消费者和生产者服务，他们坚持了“产地低于销地，城市低于乡村，商业利润低于工业利润”的定价原则。总的利润不超过百分之十，而多数人所需用的火柴、碱面、肥皂、牙刷、红白糖等大路货和针织品利润更低，甚至只取工本费不取利润，这是旧社会百货店从来没有的事。在他们的影响下，别的百货店也减低了利润，每天上午八点他们的牌价公布后，好多私商小贩都来打听抄写，作为自己定价的参考。至于托售部的商品虽由各厂方自订，但也动员他们和公司一样“薄利多销”为广大人民服务。
    该公司的货品来源，第一种是来自本市的公私营工厂，依据“商业为工业服务”的原则，他们扶植了针织、火柴、肥皂、卷烟、橡胶等行业。方法是供给原料收购成品，或以成品换原料。半年来（三——八月）共供给棉纱、羊绒、赤磷、火碱、碎铁、盐卜、盘纸、硫化青、亚铅华等原料价值五亿三千余万元（当时小米每斤百元上下）。他们则收购了下列产品：计有肥皂一六、一四五箱，火柴三、二七九箱，纸烟二七五、四○○条，铁锅九三、四五二斤，七二、四五一打，袜子八九、○一○打以及床单、衫衣、色水、笔记本、蚊帐布、线毯等物，共值本币九亿九千四百余万元，约合米一千六百五十余万斤。既开辟了充畅货品来源，又扶植了有益国计民生的工业生产，并且开展了家庭副业，带动了广大妇女参加生产（针织交换者妇女占四分之一以上）。另外参加托售部的从七月份起即有五十余家工厂，三百多种货品。中国卫生牙刷工厂，大华窑业公司，春和体育用品社等厂，参加托售后销货特多。八月份又与清河制呢厂、燕京造纸厂、新建铁工厂等建立了托售关系，起了扶植生产沟通有无的纽带作用。
    第二种是通过和友邻区的物资交流交换来的。他们曾主动地派出干部到东北、西北各友邻区商订易货合同，组织物资交换，九月前以北京的针织品、纸烟、火柴、日记本等物，换回东北的砂糖、豆油，内蒙的驼、羊毛，察省的白麻，石门的线毯。十月底以袜子五万打、毛巾一万打、绒衣一万件、毛线两千磅、褥单布一千一百匹交换东北的大批汽油、变压器油及各种纸张等物。此外，并经过华北百货总公司从上海购来各种百货一、四三七箱，并与人民银行北京分行签订合同，合营采购工业原料，扶植工业生产，调剂各种日用品。对促进各地物资交流上起了很大作用。
