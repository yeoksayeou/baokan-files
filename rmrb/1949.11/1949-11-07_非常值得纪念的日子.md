　　A Very Worthy Day of Remembrance
    Mǎ Xùlún

    Today is the 32nd anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution in the Soviet Union. On this very worthy day of remembrance, I am reminded that over the past thirty-two years, under the leadership of the great parties of Lenin and Stalin, the Soviet people have overcome countless difficulties, struggled arduously, and created the world's first glorious socialist country, which has pointed out a bright path for the people of the whole world.
    In commemorating the October Socialist Revolution, we must correctly understand the great friendship of the Soviet Union with the working people of the world, and especially the great friendship of the Soviet Union with the Chinese people. Since the October Revolution, the Soviet Union has always been the closest friend of the Chinese people. She has always sincerely helped our Chinese people, and this help is unconditional, based on the true love, mutual assistance, and equality of mankind. This is a concrete manifestation of the great spirit of internationalism. We must correctly understand and value this friendship. At the same time, we must thoroughly expose all the deceptive propaganda of the reactionary forces at home and abroad against the Soviet Union.
    In commemorating the October Socialist Revolution, we resolutely implement Chairman Mao's correct "leaning to one side" foreign policy. We must resolutely side with the Soviet Union, side with the world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, support the peace policy of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, unite all peace-loving and democratic people in the world under the leadership of the Soviet Union, oppose and shatter the provocations of a new war by imperialism, and strive for lasting world peace.
    In commemorating the October Socialist Revolution, we must learn from the Soviet Union's experience in nation-building. "The path taken by the Soviet people is precisely the path that our Chinese people must take. The Soviet people's experience in nation-building is worth learning well by our Chinese people. In the past, our Chinese people's revolution learned from the Soviet Union, 'taking Russia as a teacher,' and that is why we were able to achieve such a victory. From now on, when we build our country, we must also 'take Russia as a teacher' and learn from the Soviet Union's experience in nation-building."
    Finally, we shout loudly:
    Long live the Soviet Union, the world's first socialist country!
    Long live Sino-Soviet friendship!

　　非常值得纪念的日子
    马叙伦
    今天是伟大的苏联十月社会主义革命三十二周年纪念日。在这个非常值得纪念的日子，使我回想起三十二年来，苏联人民在伟大的列宁、斯大林的党的领导下，克服了无数次的困难，艰苦卓绝地奋斗，创造了世界上第一个光辉灿烂的社会主义国家，它为全世界人民指出了一条光明的道路。
    纪念十月社会主义革命，我们要正确认识苏联友邦对全世界劳动人民的伟大友谊，尤其要正确认识苏联对中国人民的伟大友谊。苏联自十月革命以来，即一直是中国人民最亲密的朋友，她一直是真心真意地帮助我们中国人民，而这种帮助是无条件的，基于人类真正的友爱、互助、平等的基础之上，这是伟大的国际主义精神的具体表现。我们必须要正确认识和重视这种友谊。同时我们还要彻底揭露国内外反动派对苏联的一切欺骗宣传。
    纪念十月社会主义革命，我们坚决执行毛主席正确的“一边倒”的外交政策。我们要坚决的倒在苏联一边，倒在以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营一边，拥护苏联及人民民主国家的和平政策，在苏联领导之下团结全世界爱好和平民主的人们，反对和粉碎帝国主义新战争的挑拨，争取世界的持久和平。
    纪念十月社会主义革命，我们要学习苏联的建国经验。“苏联人民走过的道路，正是我们中国人民要走的道路，苏联人民建国的经验是值得我们中国人民很好的学习。我们中国人民的革命，在过去就是学习苏联，‘以俄为师’所以能获得这样的胜利。从今后我们要建国，同样必须‘以俄为师’，学习苏联的建国经验。”
    最后对我们高呼：
    世界第一个出现的社会主义国家苏联万岁！
    中苏友好万岁！
