    The Yellow River is China's river of sorrow. Since reliable historical records began, it has breached its banks approximately four times every ten years. Based on pre-war prices, the floods caused by the Yellow River resulted in an average annual loss of 25 million yuan (silver dollars). However, we should not only see the negative aspects of the Yellow River; in fact, its contribution to the Chinese nation is enormous. The 250,000 square kilometers of the North China Plain were formed by the alluvial deposits of the Yellow River.

    The fundamental reason for the Yellow River's harmful nature is its excessive sediment load and extreme flow variations. The Yellow River was originally called "He" (River), but it became the "Yellow River" due to its excessive sediment content. Taking the Shanxian station as an example, the average annual sediment discharge is 1.9 billion metric tons, or 1.3 billion cubic meters. If this amount of soil were used to build a dike one meter high and one meter thick, it could encircle the Earth's equator 32 times. According to records, the maximum sediment concentration at Shanxian station accounts for 46 percent of the total flow, meaning that the weight of sand and water in the river is equal. Due to the excessive sediment, it is deposited everywhere in the gentle downstream areas, causing the riverbed to shift constantly. Even if the riverbed does not change, some of the sediment will still be deposited in the river channel or on the riverbanks as the water flows between the dikes. As the riverbed rises, the dikes must be thickened year by year, making breaches inevitable.

    The Yellow River's flow is not particularly large. The maximum recorded flow at Shanxian station is 29,000 cubic meters per second, while the Han River reaches 35,000 cubic meters per second. The unfavorable condition of the Yellow River's flow lies in its rapid and unpredictable fluctuations. During the high-water months of July, August, September, and October, the normal flow at Shanxian station is only between 3,000 and 3,500 cubic meters per second. However, with rain, it can rise to 10,000 or 20,000 cubic meters per second, or even higher, within two to four days, and then quickly fall back down. The Yellow River's maximum water level usually occurs in August. According to statistics from 1919 to 1943, the average flow at Shanxian station in August was only 3,039 cubic meters per second, while the maximum flow reached 29,000 cubic meters per second. This illustrates the suddenness of the Yellow River's floods. During the low-water months of December, January, and February, the average flow is between 480 and 580 cubic meters per second. The lowest water level in January 1938 was recorded at 150 cubic meters per second. The large difference in flow variations has the following impact on river defense: high and low water levels cause significant changes in the riverbed; it is difficult to predict the arrival of high water, making it difficult to prepare adequately.

    The main measures taken to control the Yellow River throughout history have focused on the downstream areas, using dikes as the primary tool. This is indeed an essential and effective method. However, if limited to dike construction, the river channel will remain the same as it was thousands of years ago. If prevention and control are effective, there will be fewer disasters; otherwise, the harm will be endless. In the past, the reactionary ruling classes did not control the Yellow River for the benefit of the masses. The better ones wanted to buy the people's favor and consolidate their rule; most people used river control as a path to promotion and wealth. Therefore, there has been no progress in river control for thousands of years. However, in today's context, with the liberation war having just achieved basic victory, this year's Yellow River control struggle has shown great promise. This is very gratifying and allows us to see a bright future for the Yellow River.

    To fundamentally control the Yellow River, we must manage its 50 billion cubic meters of water flow, maximizing its utilization while minimizing its harmfulness.

    The 50 billion cubic meters of water flow is the average annual flow discharged by the Yellow River at Shanxian station. Before discussing how to utilize this, we must first analyze the source of the floods. In 1942, the maximum flow at Shanxian station was 29,000 cubic meters per second, of which 75 percent came from the area between Baotou and Longmen, while only 7.2 percent came from above Baotou. In 1933, the maximum flow at Shanxian station was 22,600 cubic meters per second, of which 72 percent came from the Jing and Wei River area, while only 9.7 percent came from above Baotou. In 1937, the maximum flow at Shanxian station was 16,500 cubic meters per second, of which 52 percent came from the area between Tongguan and Shanxian, while only 16 percent came from above Baotou. Based on these records, the source of downstream disasters does not come from above Baotou, but from the three areas below Tuoketuo. This shows that to prevent and control floods, we should focus on the management of the main tributary basin between Tuoketuo and Zhengxian. Regarding the sediment carried by the Yellow River, statistics from Baotou station for five years from 1936-1937 and 1941-1943 show that the average annual sediment discharge is approximately 220 million metric tons, or 150 million cubic meters. This amount is only 11.6 percent of that at Shanxian station. From this, it can also be seen that the source of downstream sediment is not above Tuoketuo. The sediment from the upper reaches is mostly deposited on the plateaus of Ningxia and Suiyuan. Five-year statistics from Longmen station show that the annual sediment discharge is approximately 57.9 percent of that at Shanxian station. Five-year statistics from Tongguan station show that it is approximately 63.2 percent of that at Shanxian station. Therefore, it can be said that the sediment that harms the downstream areas also comes from the area below Tuoketuo, which is the same as the source of the floods.

    The utilization of water can be divided into irrigation, navigation, and power generation. Regarding irrigation, to maximize the utilization of river water, we must have the greatest flow when crops need water. The Yellow River's high-water season coincides with the rainy season, which is in the summer or early autumn. During other periods, the water flow is low, and there is little water available. Taking Shanxian station as an example again, according to 27 years of statistics, the water flow during the four months from July to October accounts for 61.21 percent of the entire year. This means that in one-third of the year, two-thirds of the annual water volume flows away. These four months are the plant propagation season, but it is also the rainy season, so farmland needs less water. Therefore, to maximize the effectiveness of irrigation, we must manage the entire year's water flow, storing water during periods of high flow and releasing it during periods of drought. Secondly, the most favorable season for natural river navigation is during the mid-water period. During floods, the rapid and turbulent currents often halt navigation. During low-water periods, sandbars emerge and hinder navigation, making it difficult to carry heavy loads. Therefore, the water flow requirements for navigation are different from those for irrigation. Finally, regarding hydropower generation, the situation is the same as with navigation. The most desirable water flow is one that has the same flow rate in all seasons. If the water flow varies too much, not only is the power output uncertain, but the efficiency of the water turbine is also greatly affected.

    Now, let's first discuss flood control. The tool for managing water flow should be to build reservoirs in the middle reaches, from Tuoketuo to Mengjin. This area has suitable dam sites in terms of both geology and topography, making it possible to build large reservoirs. This would be sufficient to control downstream floods to below 10,000 or 8,000 cubic meters per second. The current problem is sediment accumulation in the reservoirs. Some good methods have been theoretically developed, but model tests have not yet been conducted. In addition, if the flood channel between Mengjin and Puyang can be utilized well, it can store 2.4 billion cubic meters of water. The river channel between the Jin Dike and the Lin Huang Dike on the north bank from Puyang to Taochengbu, and the large dike and the Lin Huang Dike on the south bank from Lishengcun to Huanghuasi, can store 2.1 billion cubic meters of water. The natural river channel between Mengjin and Puyang is already functioning. If the area between the dikes on the north and south banks can be planned properly, and compensation and relief measures are established, it will be an effective way to reduce the flood peak in the Shandong Plain. This has already been partially implemented this year.

    Secondly, let's talk about water utilization. The Yellow River's annual flow of 50 billion cubic meters can only irrigate 30 million mu of land even if it is fully utilized. Therefore, we must find ways to manage the water flow. The main tool is to build reservoirs at appropriate locations in the middle and upper reaches and in various tributaries. These can be combined with flood control reservoirs and used flexibly. Here, I would like to add that I mentioned above that the floods above Tuoketuo contribute very little to the overall flood volume. Now, I want to explain that the water flow above Tuoketuo is extremely abundant and beneficial for replenishing the downstream during droughts, ensuring that the downstream does not dry up in winter and that there is sufficient water during the mid-water period. Therefore, the scope of water flow management must be extended to the upper reaches. Between Shanxian and Mengjin, there are suitable locations for building reservoirs at Sanmenxia, Balihutong, and Xiaolangdi. Building a dam at either Sanmenxia or Balihutong would solve the current downstream flood problem. If the other two locations are also built in the future, one can be used for flood control and water storage, and the other two can be used for power generation. In addition, there are many excellent dam sites between Tuoketuo and Longmen, between Gaolan and Qingtongxia, and between Guide and Gaolan. According to the Japanese plan, the completion of just the eleven dams in the middle reaches from Tuoketuo to Mengjin would result in an average power generation of 4,376,000 kilowatts, with an annual power generation of 38.41 billion kilowatt-hours. The hydropower resources in the upper reaches are not included in this. If the available water flow is 1,000 cubic meters per second, it can irrigate at least 20 million mu of land. After the downstream river channel is adjusted, ships with a draft of two meters can pass unhindered.

    The Yellow River itself has abundant natural resources. Our vision is not a fantasy. The development of industry, agriculture, transportation, and the improvement of the economy, as well as the improvement of cultural standards, are all inevitable consequences of water conservancy development. It truly has an infinitely bright future!

    新黄河的光明前途
    水利专家张含英在水利联席会议上的报告摘要
    黄河是中国的害河，自有确切历史记载以来，大约每十年有四次决口，以抗战前的物价作标准，黄水造成的水灾，每年平均损失二千五百万元（硬币）。但是我们也不要只看到黄河不好的一面，其实她对于中华民族的贡献是十分巨大的；二十五万平方公里的华北大平原就是由黄水的冲积而来的。
    黄河为害的基本原因是本身挟带泥沙过多和流量变化过巨。黄河本来的名字叫河，因水中含泥沙过多，就变成了“黄河”。以陕县站作例，平均每年输送的泥沙为十九亿公吨，也就是十三亿公方。若将这一数量的土质修一公尺高一公尺厚的堤，可以围绕地球赤道三十二周。陕县站的最大含沙量，据记载占全部流量的百分之四十六，也就是说河流中的沙和水的重量是相等的。因泥沙过多，到了下游平缓地带，随地淤积，造成河槽随时变迁。就是河槽没有变化，水行在两堤之间，泥沙的一部也要淤积在河身或河滩上的。河槽既高，堤必逐年加厚，这样便不可能避免决口的发生。
    黄河的流量并不算大，陕县站的最大流量记载为二万九千秒公方，而汉水即达三万五千秒公方。黄河流量不利的条件在于涨落变化迅速而难测。在大水的七、八、九、十等四月内，陕县站平常的水流亦只在三千至三千五百秒公方之间；但遇雨，在二日至四日内即可涨达一万、二万秒公方，甚至有更大的流量，而在短期内又可落回。黄河的最大水一般多在八月，自一九一九——一九四三年的统计，陕县站在八月的平均流量仅三、○三九秒公方，而最大流量则达二九、○○○秒公方。由此可看出黄水突出的形势。在低水的十二、一、二各月内平均在四八○至五八○秒公方间，一九三八年一月最低水位曾降至一五○秒公方。水流变化差过大，对于河防的影响是：高低水对河槽的变化特大；大水来临难测，不易作适当准备。
    历代治河的主要措施是将大部力量放在下游，而以堤防为唯一工具，这确是不可缺少的有效方法之一。不过若仅限于筑堤，则河道仍然和几千年前的河道一样，防治得当时，少些祸害，否则为害无穷。过去反动的统治阶级治河并不是为人民大众作想，好一点是想买人民欢喜，巩固自己的统治；大多数的人都借治河为升官发财的门径。所以治河几千年，一无进步。可是在解放战争刚获得基本胜利的今天，今年的治黄斗争就显示出很大的表现。这一点十分令人高兴，使我们看见黄河光明的前途。
    要想根治黄河，就必须掌握黄河五百亿公方的水流，使它能有最大的利用，为最小的祸害。
    五百亿公方的水流是黄河在陕县站全年下泄的平均流量，在说到如何利用前，必须先分析洪水来源。一九四二年陕县站的最大流量为二九、○○○秒公方，其中百分之七十五来自包头到龙门一带的地域，而来自包头以上的仅占百分之七点二。一九三三年陕县站的最大流量为二二、六○○秒公方，其中百分之七十二来自泾渭地域，来自包头以上的仅占百分之九点七。一九三七年陕县的最大流量为一六、五○○秒公方，其中百分之五十二来自潼关至陕县一带的地域，而来自包头以上的仅占百分之十六。从这一切的记载看来，下游祸害的水源不来自包头以上，而来自托克托以下的三个地域。这说明要想防治洪水，应着重在托克托到郑县间本支流域的治理。再就黄水所挟泥沙而论，包头站一九三六——一九三七及一九四一——一九四三年五年的统计，平均每年的输沙量约为二点二亿公吨，亦即一点五亿公方。这个数量仅当陕县站的百分之十一点六。从此亦可知下游泥沙的来源不在托克托以上。上游的泥沙大都淤积在宁夏、绥远的高原。龙门站五年统计，年输沙量约当陕县站的百分之五十七点九，潼关站五年的统计，约当陕县站的百分之六十三点二。所以说为害下游的泥沙也来自托克托以下的地域，和洪水的来源相同。
    水的利用可以分为灌田、航运和发电。就灌田说，要想得到河水最大的利用，必须在农作物需水时有最大的水流。黄河大水时期适值雨季，亦即在夏季或早秋之际，其余时期水流低落，可用的水颇少。仍以陕县站为例，据二十七年的统计，七至十月四个月的水流占全年的百分之六十一点二一，也就是说以全年三分之一的时间，流去全年三分之二的水量。这四个月是植物繁殖季节，但正值雨季，农田需水较少。所以要想得到灌溉的最大效用，必须掌握全年水流，水多时节蓄，涸时接济。其次天然河道最利航运的季节是中水时期，洪水湍急汹涌时，每多停航；低水时期则沙滩横生阻碍，载重难行。所以航运对于水流所要求的调节又与灌田不同。最后说到水力发电，情形和航运相同，最恶的水流也是要四季的流量相同。水流变化过大，不只出电量不一定，且水机效率大受影响。
    今先以防洪论，掌握水流的工具当为先在中游的托克托到孟津中建筑水库。这一带无论是地质和地形上确有适当的坝址，可以造大水库。这样足可将下游的洪水控制在一万或八千秒公方以下。现在存在的问题是水库内泥沙淤积问题，在理论上已得到一些好的方法，所缺者是还没有作模型试验。此外若能善用孟津到濮阳间的洪水河槽，可节蓄水二十四亿公方；北岸濮阳到陶城埠一段金堤与临黄堤、南岸李升屯到黄花寺一段大堤与临黄堤间的河槽，可节蓄流水二十一亿公方。孟津到濮阳的一段自然河槽现已发生作用，南北岸两堤间的面积若能安为计划，并订出赔偿损失和救济办法，是减低山东平原洪峰的有效办法。今年已局部实行。
    其次说到水的利用。黄河全年五百亿公方水流，全部利用也仅能灌溉三千万亩。因此必须设法掌握水流，主要的工具就是在中、上游和各支流的适当地点建筑水库，这可与防洪的水库合并为一，再加以灵活运用。在这里还需要补充一点，上面曾说过托克托以上的洪水对于洪水的供给很少。现在要说明托克托以上的水流，对于下游枯水的接济是极丰盛而有利的，能使下游冬季不涸，中水得济。因此掌握水流的范围必须推及上游。在陕县到孟津间有三门峡、八里胡同及小浪地都是筑水库的适当地点。能在三门或八里胡同之一处筑霸，即可解决目前下游的洪水问题；其余两处在将来若也修筑起来，则一处作为防洪蓄水，两处作发电之用。此外托克托到龙门间、皋兰到青铜峡间、贵德到皋兰间优良的坝址还很多。按照日本人的计划，仅中游托克托至孟津的十一个坝完成后，可得平均发电量四百三十七万六千千瓦，全年发电量为三百八十四亿一千万千瓦时。上游的水电资源还不在内。而可利用的水流若为一千秒公方，则至少可灌田两千万亩。下游河槽加以调整后，吃水二公尺的船只可通行无阻。
    黄河本身具有天然的丰富资源，我们的远景并不是幻想。随着水利的发展而兴起的工业、农业、交通以及经济情况的改善，文化水平的提高都是必然的结果，真是具有无限光明的前途！
