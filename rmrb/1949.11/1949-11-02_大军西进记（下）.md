　　Record of the Westward Advance of the Army (Part 2)
　　Luo Liwu, Deputy Political Commissar of the 192nd Division
　　3. The People

　　"Advance to Ningxia and eliminate the Ma bandit army!" "Eliminate the remnants of the two Ma's bandit armies and completely liberate the Great Northwest!" "Celebrate the victorious expedition of the People's Liberation Army, work hard to produce, and support the front!" Inside and outside the east gate of Guyuan city, along the main road, crowds of people gathered to see off the troops, including workers, farmers, students, and merchants... They enthusiastically applauded, shouted slogans, beat gongs and drums, and set off firecrackers. Elementary school students held piles of flowers, vying to pin them on the chests of the soldiers. The seemingly endless line, like a long snake, snaked northwards in the drizzling rain. Slogans such as "Advance bravely, annihilate the Ning Ma bandit army, and respond to the aspirations of the people!" and "Fight well, maintain good policy and discipline, and live up to the send-off from the people of Guyuan!" remained deeply etched in people's hearts.

　　During the advance, we saw traces of looting and plundering by the Ma bandits all the way, and we also heard the accusations of the Hui and Han people against the atrocities of the Ma bandits. Wherever the Ma bandits went, they not only conscripted soldiers and laborers, but also robbed and burned everything. Merchants in small towns and villagers in the countryside had everything taken away as long as they had anything. Doors, windows, and wheat ears were all used as fuel, and livestock were let loose in the fields to graze on the crops. Donkeys and camels were seized wherever they were found. Therefore, the broad masses of people regarded us as saviors, longing for the Liberation Army like they would for their long-separated relatives. Our army pursued the defeated enemy south of Jinji and entered Majia Bridge. An old man in his fifties greeted us excitedly, shouting, "The saviors are here, our eyes have been waiting for you until they are red!" In Wuzhong Fort, an old white-haired Wang Mama in her sixties stretched out her trembling hands, took hold of the soldiers and said: "Oh! We can see the sun now. Two of my three sons were taken by the Ma family, leaving only the youngest at home, with nothing to eat or drink. I heard that the Liberation Army is a poor people's army and also implements a lenient policy, not killing those who were conscripted by the Ma bandits. This is truly a life-saving benefactor!" Another old man wiped his moist eyes and said tremblingly, "I only have one son. The first time they conscripted soldiers, it cost four hundred silver dollars, and the second time they wanted labor, it cost three hundred dollars. The third time, I really couldn't afford it, and I watched as the Ma family dragged him away!..." Then, he pointed to the west bank of the Yellow River and cursed: "Ma Hongkui, Ma Hongkui, you are evil to the core, you have harmed so many people!..." The soldiers shouted excitedly in unison: "We will thoroughly annihilate the Ma bandit army, liberate the Great Northwest, and avenge the people!" In the Lingwu area, the masses complained to us about the Ma bandits' tyranny of "labor, grain, and hides." Every day it was either requisitioning grain or conscripting soldiers, and all slaughtered sheepskins were confiscated by the Ma bandits. There were thirty-eight kinds of exorbitant taxes and levies that could be listed by name.

　　South of Jinji, an Ahong, seeing our slogans of "Protect Mosques," said with emotion: "The Liberation Army is really good, protecting the interests of our Hui people." In Wuzhong Fort, another Ahong said to the soldiers: "The Ma family army said that you came to destroy religion and kill the Hui people, but now we know that it is not the case at all. You respect the customs and habits of the Hui people everywhere, without beating or scolding. Comparing you to the Ma family army, who conscripted soldiers and robbed grain here, running rampant, you are truly like heaven and earth!" Near Tongxin City, many Han villages told us stories of the Hui people's major rebellions every thirty years and minor rebellions every fifteen years, bitterly hating Ma Hongkui's rule and the bandit leaders in the mountains. When we explained to them that just as Chiang Kai-shek was the common enemy of the people of the whole country, Ma Hongkui was the common enemy of the Hui and Han people of Ningxia, that in the past they provoked relations between the Hui and Han people, and used the contradictions between the Hui and Han people to consolidate their rule, and that today the Hui and Han people should unite and overthrow the common oppressors, they praised in unison: "That's exactly the case, the Communist Party's policy is really good!"

　　As the troops advanced near Zhongning, the troops ahead had already passed by several hours ago, but the welcoming crowd had not dispersed yet. Tea, watermelons... were still placed on both sides of the road, and red and green slogans of "Welcome the Liberation Army" were posted everywhere. When we advanced north from Zhongning, almost every village was filled with groups of men, women, old, and young, waiting to see the Liberation Army. They paid special attention to our artillery and discipline. An old man pointed to the artillery unit pulled by twelve mules and said: "I have lived for more than fifty years, and I have never seen this before. Once it fires, the Ma family army will be finished." An old man talked to me about his views on the Liberation Army, he said: "That's great, they pay for a bundle of grass, and they don't lose a small bowl they borrow. Not to mention beating and scolding, the officials and soldiers are all friendly." When we advanced to the hillside south of Jinji, an old man carried rice soup from ten miles away to meet the troops, saying: "Comrades, you have worked hard, come and drink some and enter the village, every family has cooked rice soup waiting for you!" Later, we entered a Hui village, and rice soup and noodles were already laid out all over the street. Two old women, not caring about eating, also carried a bucket of rice soup, serving it out bowl by bowl to the soldiers, insisting that they drink it. A certain company's instructor, in the midst of heavy gunfire, spoke to the masses to express his gratitude. More and more people came, each as happy as if they were celebrating a happy event. We entered Wuzhong Fort, Dazhai Village, Lingwu City, and other places, and were all warmly welcomed by the masses. We were stationed in a certain village five miles south of Lingwu City. Soon after entering the house, a Hui villager brought the rice porridge and dry rice he had prepared for us.

　　Especially moving was when my left-wing troops entered Majia Bridge, south of Jinji City, the remaining enemy was still resisting north of the village, and the masses came out to guide us, saying: "The Ma family army just ran away from the northeast of the village, you should catch up with them!" During the battle north of the village, a wounded soldier could not be carried down because of the enemy's firepower blockade. Four or five old men said: "You are sacrificing and shedding blood for our liberation, let us find a way to carry the wounded soldier down." After our repeated dissuasion, it had no effect. Finally, two old men, under my fire cover, braved the enemy fire and safely carried the wounded soldier back.

　　4. The Ma Family Army

　　Ma Hongkui, the bandit leader of Ningxia, had already run away to Chongqing with his tail between his legs before our army arrived in Ningxia. The remaining few army commanders each had their own plans. But in general, they were panic-stricken, shaken, and confused. When we entered the vicinity of Zhongning, the enemy's 81st Army first sent representatives to negotiate peace. Then the 11th Army and the Helan Army all fled to the west bank of the Yellow River. The enemy's 128th Army was the "main force" of the Ning Ma, and before they had been hit by the iron hammer of the People's Liberation Army, they were still unwilling to honestly surrender to the people, and slogans of "Fight for every inch of land" and "Resist to the end" were written everywhere. When our army arrived south of Wuzhong Fort, the outskirts of Wuzhong Fort, and even the suburbs of Lingwu City, the enemy had successively sent the chief of staff and deputy regimental commander of the 3rd Security Division, and the deputy division commander and political work director of the 256th Division, to ask us for peace. Their internal opinions were not consistent, and they were all there to delay our army's advance and buy time to retreat and flee. Therefore, the enemy's main force, the 128th Army, was still divided, quickly inserted, strongly attacked and annihilated by us.

　　In Qinglongxia and northwest of Jinji, the Ma bandits opened the sluice gates and breached the dikes to flood the area. As a result, the canals and Luo River south of Jinji and south of Wuzhong Fort became many rivers and canals that could not be crossed. The enemy bandits destroyed all the bridges spanning tens or hundreds of miles east and west, combining them with many high bunkers and low fortresses, attempting to delay or even prevent our army's progress, in order to achieve their dying struggle or bargain. Before the start of the campaign, our army, based on the situation in the Northwest and the internal situation of the Ning Ma bandit army, had emphasized from top to bottom the use of political offensives combined with military strikes to eliminate the enemy. When we closely surrounded or fiercely pursued a certain part of the enemy, all commanders and fighters paid attention to shouting slogans at the front line. Often, when one or two fortresses were captured by our strong attacks, the enemies in the nearby fortresses would raise white flags or throw out their weapons to demand surrender. Under the powerful military and political offensive of the Liberation Army, all the Ma bandits' conspiracies and attempts, such as deploying defenses, guarding bunkers, setting up obstacles, and feigning surrender... were smashed. The only two roads laid out in front of them were either surrender or annihilation.

　　When we were attacking the outskirts of Jinji, an enemy prisoner of war with a head injury that had not yet healed was propagandizing to the masses. He said: "I was wounded and captured while fighting with the Liberation Army at Renshan River. The Liberation Army not only did not kill me, but also applied medicine to me and released me home. This time, I knew that the Liberation Army was coming soon, so I told the people many advantages of the Liberation Army, telling everyone not to believe the Ma bandits' rumors!"

　　Later, when our small units chased to Hengcheng to intercept the fleeing enemy, the masses told us about the embarrassing situation of the Ma bandits' defeated soldiers crossing the Yellow River. There were only three small boats there, and the boatmen had all fled. The Ma bandits' scattered infantry and cavalry rushed up at once. The infantry boarded the boats, and the cavalry came and would not let them leave, and they fired at each other in the river and on the shore. Later, all three small boats were washed away by the water, and they hugged doors, wheat straw... and jumped into the river, drowning many people. Many stragglers and vagrants around Lingwu and Wuzhong Fort, influenced by our lenient policy, almost every day many people found our troops and government, voluntarily registered and reported, and handed over their weapons. Some also led us to search and suppress and win over large and small groups of remnants scattered everywhere. They said: "If we had known that you were so lenient and so good, why would we have risked our lives for Ma Hongkui, and why would we have fled in all directions!"

　　大军西进记（下）
    一九二师副政委  罗立武
　　三　老百姓
    “打到宁夏去，消灭马匪军！”“消灭两马残余匪军，全部解放大西北！”“庆祝解放军胜利出征，努力生产，支援前线！”固原城东门里外，大道旁，拥挤着欢送的人群，工人、农民、学生、商人……热烈地鼓着掌，喊着口号，敲着锣鼓，放着鞭爆。小学生们捧着一堆堆的鲜花，争着插向战士们的胸前。长蛇般似乎无穷无尽的行列，在细雨蒙蒙中，不断向北蜿蜒伸展。“奋勇前进，消灭宁马匪军，回答老乡们的热望！”“打好仗，搞好政策纪律，不负固原人民的欢送！”等口号声，长久地留在人们的心坎里。
    进军途中，我们一路看到马匪抢掠洗劫的痕迹，也一路听到回汉人民对马匪暴行的控诉。马匪每到一地，不仅抓兵抓夫，而且抢光烧光。小市镇的商人，农村里的老乡，只要有点东西的都被拿走了。门窗、麦穗都是他们的燃料，田里的粮食庄稼都放了牲口。毛驴、骆驼见一个拉走一个。因此广大群众把我们看成救命星，盼解放军象盼自己久别的亲人。我军在金积以南追击溃敌，进入马家桥。一个五十余岁的老汉迎头兴奋的喊：“救命的恩人来了，可把我们的眼睛盼红啦！”吴中堡一个六十多岁的白发的王老妈妈伸出颤抖的手，拉着战士们说：“哎呀！可看见太阳了，我三个儿子，给马家抓走了两个，剩下一个小的在家，没吃没喝。听说解放军是穷人的队伍，又讲宽大政策，不杀被马匪抓兵当兵的，这真是救命恩人啊！”另一个老汉揩着湿润的眼睛颤抖的说：“我只一个儿子，头一回抓兵花了四百块白洋，第二回要丁又花了三百块，第三回实在花不起了，眼看着马家把他拉走了！……”接着，他指着黄河西岸大骂：“马鸿逵，马鸿逵，你可坏到头了，害死多少老百姓啊！……”战士们异口同声激动的喊出：“我们要彻底歼灭马匪军，解放大西北，给老乡们报仇！”在灵武一带，群众纷纷向我们诉述马匪“丁、粮、皮”的暴政，每天不是征粮，便是抓兵，一切屠宰的羊皮都给马匪没收了去，苛捐杂税，可以列举出名目的就有三十八种。
    在金积以南，一个阿訇看见我们贴着“保护清真寺”的标语，感动地说：“解放军真好，保护我们回民的利益”。在吴忠堡又一个阿訇对战士们说：“马家军说你们来了灭教杀回民，现在才知道完全不是这么回事，你们处处尊重回民风俗习惯，不打不骂，和马家军在这抓丁抢粮，横行霸道比一下，真是一个天上，一个地下啊！”在同心城附近，许多汉人的村庄，都向我们传说着回民三十年一大反，十五年一小反的故事，切齿痛恨马鸿逵的统治和山上的土匪头子。当我们向他们解释，正象蒋介石是全国人民的公敌一样，马鸿逵是宁夏回汉人民的共同敌人，过去他们挑拨回汉关系，利用回汉矛盾来巩固自己的统治，今天回民汉人要团结起来，打倒共同的压迫者时，他们异口同声地称赞道：“就是这么回事，共产党的政策真好！”
    部队进至中宁附近，前面的部队已经过去几个钟头了，欢迎的人群还没有散去，茶水、西瓜……还摆在大路两旁，“欢迎解放军”的红绿标语，到处张贴着。当我们从中宁北进的时候，几乎每个村庄都站着一群男女老少，等着看解放军，他们特别注意的是我们的大炮和纪律。一个老汉指着十二个骡子拉的炮军说：“我活了五十多，从来没见过这个，一开炮，保管马家军就完了。”一个老乡向我谈起他对解放军的观感，他说：“那太好了，抱一捆草也给钱，借个小碗也丢不了，别说打骂，当官当兵的全一样和气。”我们进至金积以南的山坡上，一个老汉从十里外挑着米汤迎上部队，说：“同志们辛苦了，快喝点进村子吧，我们家家户户都烧好米汤等着你们呢！”后来我们进入一个回民的村庄，大米汤、面条早摆满街上，两个老太婆顾不上吃饭，也抬了一桶米汤，一碗碗盛出来递到战士手里，非让喝不行。某连指导员，在紧密的枪声中，向群众讲话道谢，人们愈来愈多，个个象办喜事一样高兴。我们进入吴忠堡、大寨子、灵武城等地，都同样受到群众的热烈欢迎。我们驻在灵武城南五里的某村，刚进入房子不久，一个回民老乡，便把为我们做好的大米稀饭、干饭一起端来了。
    特别动人的是我左翼部队进入金积城南马家桥时，残敌还在村北抗击，群众便纷纷出来指引我们说：“马家军刚从村东北方向跑了，你们快追上他吧！”在该村村北战斗中，一个伤员因为敌人火力封锁抬不下来，四五个老乡说：“你们牺牲流血，为了我们解放，让我们想法把伤员抬下来。”经过我们再三劝阻，都无效果。最后，两个老乡还是在我火力掩护下，冒着敌火，把伤员安全的抬回来了。
　　四　马家军
    宁夏匪首马鸿逵，在我大军进抵宁夏以前，早夹着尾巴逃到重庆去了。剩下几个军长，各有各人的打算。但总的来说，他们是张惶失措，动摇慌乱。当我们进入中宁前后，敌八十一军首先派代表来谈和。接着十一军贺兰军都逃到黄河西岸去了。敌一二八军是宁马的“主力”，在他们还没有受到人民解放军的铁锤打击之前，仍不肯老老实实的向人民投降，到处还写着“寸土必争”，“抵抗到底”的标语。在我大军进抵吴忠堡以南、吴忠堡外围，以至灵武城郊的时候，敌曾先后派出保三师参谋主任、副团长，敌二五六师副师长、政工处长等，向我求和。他们内部意见既不一致，又都是为了延缓我军进攻，争取时间溃退逃窜而来的。因此敌匪主力一二八军，还是为我各个分割，猛插强攻而歼灭了。
    马匪在青铜峡，在金积西北，均放开水闸，决堤灌水。致金积以南，吴忠堡以南的水渠与洛河，都成为许多不能徒涉的河渠。敌匪将东西十数里至数十里的桥梁悉数破坏，结合着许多高碉低堡，企图凭此延缓甚至阻止我军的进展，以达其垂死挣扎或讨价还价的目的。我军在战役开始以前，根据西北形势，与宁马匪军内部情况，曾从上而下的强调以政治攻势结合军事打击来消灭敌人。当我们紧紧包围或猛烈追击某一部分敌人的时候，全体指战员都注意火线喊话。往往当一两个堡寨为我强攻占领以后，附近堡寨的敌人，便纷纷插起白旗或扔出武器来要求投降。在强大的解放军军事政治攻势下，马匪一切布防、守碉、设障碍、假投降……等阴谋企图都给粉碎了，摆在他们面前的道路只有两条，不是投降就是被歼。
    当我们进攻金积外围的时候，一个头部负伤尚未痊愈的敌俘，正向群众宣传。他说：“我是在任山河与解放军作战时负伤被俘的，解放军不仅不杀我，还给我上了药释放回家。这次，我知道解放军快来了，就给老乡们宣传许多解放军的好处，告诉大家千万不能听信马匪的谣言！”
    后来当我们的小部队追到横城堵截逃敌的时候，群众纷纷向我们诉述马匪溃兵抢渡黄河的狼狈情形。该处只有三只小船，船夫都逃匿了，马匪溃散的步兵骑兵一下拥上来，步兵上了船，骑兵赶来了不放他们走，河里和岸上，互用开枪射击。后来三只小船都给水冲跑了，他们便抱着门板、麦草……纷纷跳下河里，淹死了很多。灵武、吴忠堡周围许多散兵游勇，受我宽大政策影响，差不多每天都有许多人找到我们的部队和政府，自动登记报到，交出武器。有的还领着我们去搜剿与争取散在各处的大小股残敌。他们说：“早知道你们这样宽大，这样好，我们为什么要替马鸿逵卖命，为什么又要四散逃跑呢！”
