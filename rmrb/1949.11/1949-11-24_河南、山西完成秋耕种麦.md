Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 22nd -- Henan and Shanxi provinces have concluded their autumn ploughing and wheat planting.

Since the beginning of autumn, farmers in Henan Province, under the leadership of governments at all levels, have engaged in arduous struggles against floods. By early October, most of the flooded land had been drained, and farmers in various regions plunged into a rush to plough and sow. More than six million mu of flooded land in six special districts, including Huaiyang and Xuchang, were mostly tilled and sown after drainage. During the wheat planting, the Henan Provincial People's Government, in addition to mobilizing mutual assistance and borrowing among farmers, also lent more than ten million jin of seeds to disaster-stricken people in various places, solving the seed shortage. At the same time, labor and animal power exchange teams were organized based on the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit, resolving the difficulty of draught animals, enabling the wheat planting work to be completed smoothly. In particular, in places such as Xuchang, Jia County, and Baofeng, poor farmers had recovered some land from the struggle against local bullies because of the campaigns to eliminate bandits, oppose local bullies, and reduce rent, and their enthusiasm for production was very high. Many farmers bought more cattle and farm implements and expanded their cultivated area.

Seventy percent of the autumn fields in Shanxi Province that should be cultivated have been ploughed. As of the beginning of this month, the autumn cultivated land in Changzhi Special District reached 90 percent of the cultivatable land; and in Xinxian Special District, it reached 65 percent. Although the autumn ploughing time was shortened this autumn due to excessive rain and early frost in some areas, the autumn ploughing area this year has been further expanded than last year due to the active autumn ploughing carried out in various places under the slogan of "Plough one mu if one mu is available; plough non-stop as long as the ground is not frozen". It is estimated that the old liberated areas increased by 2 percent, and the newly liberated areas increased by 67 percent. The main reason for the success of this year's autumn ploughing work in the province is the combination of general instructions and specific organization and inspection. The Shanxi Provincial People's Government and the Provincial Party Committee jointly issued instructions on autumn ploughing, calling on all localities to carry out autumn ploughing in a timely manner; at the same time, autumn ploughing inspection teams were sent to various special districts and counties for in-depth inspection. For example, Changzhi Special District concentrated cadres from several villages to inspect one village or organized two villages to visit each other, launching a mass autumn ploughing inspection campaign. Ping Shun County discovered that some farmers were busy running transportation and neglecting autumn ploughing, and the inspection team held a forum for uncultivated households, explaining the benefits of autumn ploughing for next year's production, overcoming the tendency of some farmers to neglect autumn ploughing.

### 河南、山西完成秋耕种麦

　　河南、山西完成秋耕种麦
    【新华社北京二十二日电】河南、山西两省秋耕种麦已告结束。
    入秋以来，河南全省农民在各级人民政府领导下，和水灾进行了艰苦的斗争。至十月初，大部被淹土地脱出，各地农民即卷入抢耕抢种热潮。淮阳、许昌等六个专区六百余万亩水淹地经排水后，大部翻晒播种。在种麦中，河南省人民政府除发动农民间互助互借外，并以一千余万斤种子贷给各地灾民，解决了种子困难，同时根据自愿互利的原则组织劳畜力变工互助，解决耕畜的困难，使种麦工作得以顺利完成。特别是许昌、郏县、宝丰等地，因经过清剿散匪、反恶霸和减租等运动，贫苦农民已从反恶霸斗争中收回一部分土地，生产情绪很高。很多农民增买了耕牛农具，扩大了耕种面积。
    山西全省应耕秋田百分之七十都进行了耕犁。长治专区至本月上旬止，秋耕地已达应耕地的百分之九十；忻县专区达百分之六十五。今秋虽因多雨和部分地区早冻而缩短了秋耕时间，但由于各地在“划一亩、耕一亩；地不冻、犁不停”的口号下积极进行了秋耕，使今年秋耕面积较去年更为扩大，计老区增加百分之二，新区增加百分之六十七。该省今年秋耕工作获得成绩的主要原因是一般的指示号召和具体的组织检查相结合。山西省人民政府和中共省委曾联合发出秋耕指示，号召各地及时进行秋耕；同时并派出秋耕检查组分赴各专区及各县进行深入检查。如长治专区曾集中数村干部检查一村或组织两个村互相参观，发动了群众性的秋耕检查运动。平顺县曾发现部分农民忙于跑运输而忽视秋耕，检查组即召开未耕户座谈会，说明了秋耕对明年生产的好处，克服了部分农民忽视秋耕的偏向。
