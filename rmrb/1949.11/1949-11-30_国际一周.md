International Week

　　Soviet Union, Poland, and other countries support Foreign Minister Zhou's statement, making the US and Britain even more embarrassed in the UN General Assembly.

　　On the 15th of this month, Foreign Minister Zhou of our country sent a solemn statement to the United Nations, demanding the immediate cancellation of the legal status of the Kuomintang remnant bandit delegation in the United Nations organization, which has received the sympathy and support of our friendly countries. The head of the Polish delegation first sent a letter to UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie, suggesting that Foreign Minister Zhou's telegram be distributed to all UN member states as an official UN document. This proposal broke the conspiracy of the reactionary group representatives in the United Nations to obstruct the distribution of this telegram, forcing the UN Secretariat to publish this document as an official UN document on the 22nd. Subsequently, on the 23rd, the head of the Soviet delegation, Vyshinsky, in his speech at the UN General Assembly on the prohibition of atomic weapons and the control of atomic energy, expressed his support for the statement of Foreign Minister Zhou of our country, and righteously pointed out: The Soviet delegation "does not consider the Kuomintang delegation to be the representative of China." When the Political Committee of the United Nations discussed the Kuomintang bandit gang's slanderous accusations against the Soviet Union, the heads of the Soviet, Ukrainian, and Belarusian delegations unanimously announced their non-participation in the discussion, stating that the Kuomintang delegation was not qualified to speak on behalf of the Chinese people. Representatives of Poland and Czechoslovakia also stated that they did not recognize the legal status of the Kuomintang representatives. This just action by the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries' delegations is not only a just voice of support for the Chinese people, but also a powerful step towards defending world peace and safeguarding human dignity. Now, the representatives of the imperialist countries headed by the United States are adopting an ostrich-like attitude towards the just demands of the Chinese people; they are trying to continue to place the representatives of a small group of Kuomintang bandits in the United Nations seat for their dispatch. This is a perverse act, putting the imperialists themselves in an even more embarrassing position.

　　The Victory of the Chinese People's Revolution is Like the Rising Sun, Illuminating the Path of Struggle for Oppressed Nations

　　All democratic people around the world continue to warmly support the new People's China. Enver Hoxha, Chairman of the Council of Ministers and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of Albania, notified Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai on November 21st that the People's Republic of Albania is willing to establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China, and Minister Zhou has replied with a warm welcome. This is the tenth country after the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Hungary, Romania, North Korea, Mongolia, and the German Democratic Republic to establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China. People all over the world continue to cheer for the new China, especially the oppressed nations in the East are overjoyed, because the great victory of the Chinese People's Revolution, like the rising sun, illuminates their path of struggle and inspires their struggle for independence and freedom. A grand celebration was held in Colombo, the capital of Ceylon, and a portrait of Chairman Mao was held high in a parade around the city. Grand celebrations and demonstrations were also held in Taiyuan, the capital of the Vietnamese resistance, and in Bengal, India. Congratulatory messages filled with joy and hope celebrating the birth of the new China continue to fly to Beijing from all over the world. The congratulatory message from the General Secretary of the Communist Party of India, Ranadive, said: The victory of the Chinese people has inspired the laboring masses of India to fight more resolutely and bravely to end the current regime and establish a people's democratic rule. The congratulatory message from the Iranian Masses Party said: The victory of the Chinese people is a brilliant example for the liberation struggles of Asian, Iranian, and other oppressed nations.

　　All-India Peace Congress Firmly Supports Peace, French and Australian People's Peace Vote Opposes Aggression

　　The worldwide movement for lasting peace and people's democracy is constantly strengthening and expanding. The long-prepared All-India Peace Congress successfully opened in Calcutta on the 24th. The congress represents millions of peace-loving and democratic Indian people. The task of this conference is to further organize a broad mass movement to launch the struggle to support peace, oppose imperialism, and oppose the danger of new wars. Many speakers at the conference guaranteed: "Never take up arms against the Soviet Union," "Firmly support peace and people's democracy." The Australian Peace Committee has launched a nationwide peace voting campaign and is preparing to convene a national peace conference in March next year to further advance the peace movement. The peace voting movement in France, which began on September 3, ended not long ago. This peace vote became a powerful demonstration by the French people against the warmongers. Despite the various sabotage and suppression measures taken by the French reactionary authorities, seven million residents still risked voting in favor of peace. This shows that the French people's desire for peace and opposition to aggressive war is irresistible. "I am sending you the completed ballot (referring to the French Association of Fighters for Peace and Freedom). I am eighty-four years old. I have experienced three wars and curse those who want to make our children cry again!" In the second district of Paris, when the police dragged the men and women who were organizing the peace vote on the street into the police car, the gathered crowd kept chasing the police car and shouting: "Long live peace!" This is the voice of the French people.

　　At the same time, to unite Asian and Australian workers and further develop the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference for peace, democracy, and national liberation, since its opening on the 16th in Beijing, the capital of the new China, representatives from various countries have exchanged information and experiences on the struggles of the working class in their respective countries, and have achieved due success, and will soon establish the Asian-Australian Liaison Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions as an agency to directly lead the workers' movements in Asia and Australia. Therefore, the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference will surely promote the further unity of the working class in Asian and Australian countries and promote the workers' movements and the surging national liberation movements in Asia and Australia to move forward. This will greatly contribute to the victory of the world's peace and democratic forces against the imperialist bloc.

　　The Laboring People of France and Italy Launch a Struggle for Survival, Marking the Upsurge of Peace and Democratic Forces in Western Europe

　　Recently, the struggle of the laboring people of France and Italy to fight for survival has marked the upsurge of peace and democratic forces in Western Europe. The laboring people of France have enthusiastically responded to the call of the General Confederation of Labor and held a 24-hour general strike as scheduled on the 25th to protest against the extremely low standard of living and the French reactionary government's refusal to increase the monthly allowance of 3,000 francs. The fact that this general strike can be successfully held on schedule is a powerful warning from the French working class, which is firmly united around the French General Confederation of Labor, to the French reactionaries. After the French General Confederation of Labor issued the call for a general strike on the 17th, the French reactionary government exerted all kinds of threats against the workers, and the right-wing Socialist Party adopted a double-dealing tactic, on the one hand, claiming to "support" the strike; on the other hand, the ministers of the Socialist Party mobilized the police, security forces, and secret agents, attempting to sabotage the strike with violence. But the reactionaries' attempt completely failed. The strike was not only held on schedule, but the large number of people participating in the strike made the strike a "100% success" (French General Confederation of Labor). This once again shows that the Marshall Plan of American imperialism and the suppression measures of the French reactionaries have failed. They have not crushed the organized strength of the French working class. On the contrary, this strength is becoming stronger day by day and is sufficient to crush any offensive by internal and external reactionaries. Italian agricultural workers have launched a large-scale struggle for land. In the provinces of Salerno, Rome, Cosasen and other provinces in southern Italy and Sicily, landless peasants have carried out a large movement of self-occupation of land, and have achieved initial victory, forcing the Gasperi government to decide to allocate a small part of the landlords' wasteland to the peasants. At the same time, the struggle of Italian industrial workers against unjustified dismissal is also booming.

　　国际一周
  　苏波等国支持周外长声明使美英在联大更狼狈不堪
    本月十五日，我国外交部周部长致电联合国，要求立即取消国民党残匪代表团在联合国组织中合法地位的庄严声明，已得到我友邦的同情和支持。波兰代表团团长首先致函联合国秘书长赖伊，建议把周外长的电文当作联合国正式文件散发给联合国各会员国。这一提议打破了联合国中的反动集团代表阻挠散发这一电文的阴谋，迫使联合国秘书处不得不于二十二日把这一文件作为联合国的正式文件发表。接着，苏联代表团团长维辛斯基二十三日在联大全会上关于禁用原子武器与管制原子能的发言中，表示支持我国周外长的声明，并义正辞严地指出：苏联代表团“不认为国民党代表团是中国的代表”。在联合国政治委员会讨论国民党匪帮对于苏联的诽谤性的控诉时，苏联、乌克兰和白俄罗斯代表团团长一致宣布不参加讨论，声明国民党代表团没有资格代表中国人民发言。波兰和捷克的代表也声言不承认国民党代表的合法地位。苏联和人民民主国家代表团的这一正义举动，不仅是对中国人民的一个正义的声援，而且也是对保卫世界和平与维护人类尊严的一个有力的步骤。现在，以美国为首的帝国主义国家的代表，对中国人民的正义要求采取驼鸟式的态度；把他们企图继续把一小撮国民党流寇的代表摆在联合国的席位上供其驱策。这是倒行逆施，使帝国主义者们自己处于更加狼狈的地位。
    中国人民革命胜利如日初升　照耀着被压迫民族斗争道路
    全世界一切民主人民，正继续热烈地拥护和支持人民新中国。阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国部长会议主席兼外交部长霍查，于十一月二十一日照会我外交部长周恩来，通知阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国愿与中华人民共和国建立外交关系，周部长已复电表示热忱欢迎。这是继苏、保、捷、波、匈、罗、朝鲜、蒙古及德意志民主共和国以后第十个与中华人民共和国建立外交关系的国家。全世界人民继续为新中国欢呼，东方的被压迫民族尤其欢欣鼓舞，因为中国人民革命的伟大胜利，如象旭日初升般照耀着它们斗争的道路，鼓舞着它们争取独立自由的斗争。锡兰首府科伦坡曾举行了盛大庆祝会，并高举毛主席像环城游行。越南抗战首都太原市以及印度孟加拉省，也举行了盛大的庆祝会和示威游行。庆祝新中国诞生的满怀喜悦和希望的贺电，继续由世界各地飞来北京。印度共产党总书记兰那地夫的贺电说：中国人民的胜利鼓舞了印度劳苦大众更坚决、更勇敢地去进行斗争，以结束现政权和建立人民民主的统治。伊朗群众党的贺电说：中国人民的胜利，是亚洲、伊朗及其他各被压迫民族争取解放斗争的辉煌榜样。
    全印和平大会坚决拥护和平　法澳人民和平投票反对侵略
    全世界争取持久和平与人民民主的运动，不断加强和扩大。筹备已久的全印和平大会，已于二十四日在加尔各答胜利开幕。大会代表着千百万爱好和平民主的印度人民。这次大会的任务，在于更进一步组织广泛的群众运动，以展开拥护和平、反对帝国主义和新战争危险的斗争。大会的许多发言者保证：“永不拿起武器反对苏联”，“坚决拥护和平与人民民主”。澳大利亚和平委员会已在全国展开和平投票运动，并准备于明年三月召开全国和平大会，把和平运动更推向前进。法国自九月三日开始的和平投票运动，已于不久以前结束。这一和平投票变成了法国人民对战争贩子的强大示威。尽管法国反动当局采取种种破坏和镇压措施，但仍有七百万居民冒险投票拥护和平。这就说明法国人民要求和平反对侵略战争的意愿，是不可抗拒的。“我把填好了的票寄给你们（按指法国争取和平和自由战士协会），我已八十四岁了，我经历了三次战争，咀咒那些想使我们子孙再次哭泣的人们！”在巴黎第二区，当警察把街上组织和平投票的男女人民抓进警车时，拥集的人群一直追着警车高呼：“和平万岁！”这就是法国人民的声音。
    与此同时，团结亚澳工人进一步地展开为和平、民主与民族解放而斗争的亚澳工会会议，自十六日在新中国首都北京开幕以来，各国的代表已在会上交换了各该国工人阶级的斗争情况和经验，得到了应有的成就，并即将建立世界工联的亚澳联络局，作为直接领导亚澳两洲工人运动的机关。因此，亚澳工会会议必将促进亚澳各国工人阶级的进一步团结，推动亚澳两洲的工人运动和高涨着的民族解放运动更加向前发展。这将大有助于世界和平民主力量反对帝国主义集团的斗争的胜益。
    法意劳动人民展开争生存斗争　标志着西欧和平民主力量高涨
    最近，法意两国劳动人民争取生存的斗争标志了和平民主力量在西欧的高涨。法国劳动人民已热烈响应总工会的号召，如期于二十五日举行二十四小时总罢工，以抗议极低的生活水平与法国反动政府拒绝按月增发三千法郎的津贴。这次总罢工能胜利地按期举行，乃是巩固地团结在法国总工会周围的法国工人阶级对法国反动派的强有力的警告。在法国总工会于十七日发出总罢工的号召以后，法国反动政府曾向工人施行百般威胁，右翼社会党则采取了两面派手段，一面扬言“支持”罢工；一面社会党的部长们却动员警察、保安队和特务，企图以暴力破坏罢工。但反动派的图谋完全失败了，罢工不仅如期举行，而且参加罢工的人数之多，使罢工得到了“百分之百的成功”（法总工会）。这再一次说明了美帝国主义的马歇尔计划和法国反动派的镇压措施是失败了，它们没有压垮法国工人阶级有组织的力量，相反，这个力量却一天比一天强大，足以粉碎内外反动派的任何进攻。意大利农业工人已掀起大规模争土地的斗争。在意大利南部的萨拉诺、罗马、科萨森等省以及西西里等地，无地农民实行了自行占地的大运动，并已获得初步胜利，迫使加斯贝利政府不得不决定把一小部分地主的荒地分配给农民。同时，意大利工业工人反对无理解雇的斗争，也正在蓬勃展开中。
