Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 13th: TASS, Tel Aviv, November 11th -- During the Israeli Knesset's discussion of Israeli Prime Minister Ben-Gurion's report, opposition representatives severely criticized the government's activities. Mikunis, General Secretary of the Israeli Communist Party, pointed out: "The government has not only failed to implement policies in line with the interests of the people and the nation, but has also catered solely to the interests of domestic and foreign capitalists." Mikunis reiterated the demand to nationalize enterprises granted to foreign operators. Mikunis emphasized that "the government has opened wide the door for the infiltration of foreign capital," and stated: "The policy of attracting foreign capital and handing over the main position of our economy to American capitalists is extremely dangerous for our country. This allows American capitalism to politically and economically enslave our country." Mikunis emphasized the need to pass a constitution as soon as possible. Speaking of foreign policy, he demanded the consolidation of relations with the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries. He said: "Our representative to the United Nations must support the Soviet proposals on banning atomic weapons, disarmament, and five-power cooperation."
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 9th: According to United Press International, London: The Central Committee of the Israeli Communist Party, in its recent resolution, condemned the slanderous speech made by Israeli Prime Minister Ben-Gurion on October 28 against the Israeli Communist Party and the Labor Party, and against the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries. The resolution pointed out: Ben-Gurion's anti-communist speech attempted to divert the attention of the masses from the government's attack on workers' wages. The resolution also pointed out: The Israeli government has joined the American camp of warmongers and the "Cold War" against communist ideology. This country is implementing policies against the Soviet Union, the People's Democratic countries, and against the Communist and Labor Parties. The resolution called on the Israeli people to organize a people's front to defend the interests of the working masses of Israel and the independence of the country.
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 10th: TASS, Beirut: The Ash-Shaab newspaper here has learned from reliable sources that the U.S. State Department is discussing with the Ben-Gurion government of Israel the issue of Israel granting the U.S. permission to establish military bases in Palestine. At the same time, Americans have suggested to the Ben-Gurion government the establishment of an American-Jewish joint stock company in Palestine, starting with the establishment of a branch of the New Jersey Mobil Oil Company.
