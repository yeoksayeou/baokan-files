Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 15th: The full text of the speech by Louis Saillant, Secretary-General of the World Federation of Trade Unions, at the welcome meeting in Beijing today is as follows:

　　Dear comrades:
　　We have traveled a long way to come to the capital of the People's Republic of China. We are very happy to be in China. In these three days, we have received a warm welcome, and we are very grateful in our hearts.
　　Today, I am not only speaking to you at the station, but I am representing the World Federation of Trade Unions in paying tribute to the entire Chinese people. I pay tribute to the Chinese people, especially to the leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao.
　　The World Federation of Trade Unions supports all oppressed nations around the world in their struggle against imperialism. Only nations that love freedom can be liberated. Today, our arrival in Beijing is a good answer to those who provoke world war. The Chinese people represent a large part of the world's proletariat. We ask you to contribute even greater strength to the struggle of the world's proletariat. We represent various different nationalities, with representatives from all over the world: Africa, Australia, the Americas, Asia, and Europe. In all countries, in different places, they are all paying tribute to the Chinese people.
　　Long live the People's Republic of China!
　　Long live the All-China Federation of Trade Unions!
　　Long live the Chinese working class!
　　Long live the leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao! (Attached picture)

　　路易·赛扬的讲词
    【新华社北京十五日电】世界工会联合会总书记路易、赛扬今日在北京欢迎会上的讲话，全文如下：
    亲爱的同志们：
    我们经过了很长的旅行，来到了中华人民共和国的首都。我们非常高兴到中国来。在这三天里面，我们受到了热烈的欢迎，我们心里非常感谢。
    我今天不仅是在车站上和大家讲话，我是代表世界工联向全中国人民致敬。我向中国人民致敬，尤其向中国人民领袖毛主席致敬。
    世界工联是支持全世界被压迫民族向帝国主义作斗争的。凡是爱好自由的民族才能得到解放。今天我们到了北京，就是对挑拨世界战争的人的很好的回答。中国人民代表了全世界无产阶级的一个大的分子。我们要求你们对全世界无产阶级的斗争贡献更大的力量。我们代表了各种不同的民族，全世界都有代表，非洲有代表，澳洲有代表，美洲有代表，亚洲有代表，欧洲有代表，在所有的国家，在不同的地方，都在向中国人民致敬。
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    中华全国总工会万岁！
    中国工人阶级万岁！
    中国人民领袖毛主席万岁！（附图片）
