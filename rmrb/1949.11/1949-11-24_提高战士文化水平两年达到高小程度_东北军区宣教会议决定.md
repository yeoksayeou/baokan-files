　　Northeast Military Region Propaganda and Education Conference Decides to Raise Soldiers' Cultural Level to Junior Elementary School Level in Two Years
　　[Shenyang News] In order to strengthen propaganda and education work in the construction of a regularized national defense army, the Northeast Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army held a military region propaganda and education work conference in the political department of the Northeast Military Region in early this month. Participating representatives included propaganda and education cadres from various provincial military regions, divisions, military schools, and units directly under the military region. The meeting discussed issues such as on-the-job cadre education, soldier education, and leadership of propaganda and education work. Regarding cadre education, based on certain tendencies in cadres' thinking and the weakness of low cultural levels, it was decided that in the future, Marxist-Leninist and Mao Zedong Thought education should be carried out systematically and step by step; at the same time, cadres' thinking should be understood, and what problems exist in their thinking should be studied, and appropriate solutions should be found. Those with low cultural levels must study culture.
　　Soldier education should be aimed at soldiers' ideological tendencies, strengthening the education of a regularized national defense army, and strengthening the education of internationalism and new patriotism, so that soldiers can recognize the revolutionary situation, be determined to carry out the revolution to the end, so as to defend economic construction, defend the motherland, defend the border, and defend world peace. At the same time, the leadership must implement the idea of centering on cultural learning, requiring that within two years, the soldiers' cultural level reach the equivalent of junior elementary school.
　　The meeting also stipulated that propaganda and education work must be led by the Party Committee, and propaganda and education cadres must be involved in discussions and arrangements for learning. It is also necessary to strengthen the leadership of teaching methods, do a good job in preparing for teaching, and the political director of the regiment must preside over it personally. The head of the propaganda and education section of the regiment presides over the preparation meeting for cultural classes, stipulates the key points of the lecture, and provides preliminary teaching plans for instructors and cultural teachers; teachers should enrich the teaching plans and give good lectures. Cultural classes must achieve a combination of learning and application, and a combination of politics and culture. The meeting also decided to strengthen the organization of propaganda and education departments at all levels and equip them with necessary propaganda and education cadres.
