Xinhua News Agency, Kiev, October 31st: The working people of the Ukrainian Republic of the Soviet Union commemorated the fifth anniversary of the republic's liberation from the rule of the Hitlerite bandits (October 14th) amidst an atmosphere of creative and constructive labor, and are preparing to welcome the thirty-second anniversary of the October Revolution (November 7th).

The Ukrainian working people have achieved tremendous success in post-war reconstruction and development. In industry: In the second quarter of this year, the Ukrainian steel industry produced 38% more pig iron and 55% more steel than in the same period last year. The machine manufacturing industry is developing smoothly, and now produces mainline locomotives, mining combines, coal cutters, improved harvesting combines, all-metal threshers, complex metalworking lathes, and extremely precise measuring instruments. The Donbass coalfield, the largest coalfield in the Soviet Union, is now approaching pre-war coal production levels and will soon complete the enormous project of extracting 500 million cubic meters of water from the flooded mines (the vast majority of which have already started operations). When the Five-Year Plan is completed, the Soviet Union will produce 250 million tons of coal annually, of which Donbass will produce 86.1 million tons, accounting for more than one-third of the total Soviet coal production.

The first section of the "Dashava-Kiev" gas pipeline has been completed. 20,000 Kiev citizens' homes and the capital's largest enterprises are using natural gas from the Carpathian Mountains (the cheapest fuel).

In agriculture, further significant successes have been achieved. The area sown with grain has reached the area stipulated in the Five-Year Plan to be reached in 1950. This year, there was a bumper harvest of grain, industrial raw materials, vegetables, and fodder. Ukraine has reported to the great Stalin that it has completed its grain procurement plan ahead of schedule. Many regions of the republic have paid more grain than in the best pre-war years. The collective farms of Soviet Ukraine are celebrating the fifth anniversary of the republic's liberation by completing the 1949 livestock development plan ahead of schedule. The number of edible cattle and dairy cows owned by collective farms has greatly exceeded pre-war levels.

Towns and villages in Ukraine are building houses in large numbers. In the post-war period, 21 million square meters of housing have been repaired or newly built in towns and workers' residential areas. In the villages, 855,000 houses have been completed.

Education, science, culture and other institutions have also made significant progress. When schools opened this year, there were 6.4 million students, 500,000 more than before the war. More than 135,000 students are enrolled in 159 institutions of higher education.

Xinhua News Agency, Riga, October 26th: The working people of the Latvian Republic of the Soviet Union and its capital, Riga, are currently commemorating the fifth anniversary of Riga's liberation from the occupation of the Hitlerite bandits, and welcoming the upcoming October Revolution anniversary with new economic and cultural achievements.

Five of the eight districts in Riga have gloriously fulfilled their pledges and completed the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. The other three districts are also rapidly approaching their goals. In the first nine months of this year, industrial output was 86.5% higher than in the whole of 1940, and about five times higher than in 1945. Among the various enterprise departments in Riga, more than 3,000 workers have already completed their Five-Year Plan quotas, while about 2,000 workers are already manufacturing products listed in the second and third Five-Year Plans. In the past five years, the republic's industry has been transformed, and newly established factories have been manufacturing products that Latvia has never manufactured before. The proportion of machine manufacturing and electrical manufacturing in Riga's industry has increased by more than twofold compared with 1945. Electric trains, trams, powerful electric motors, large automatic trunk telephone exchanges, mobile power plants, and a wide variety of first-class machines and instruments are being manufactured in Riga's workshops and factories.

One in every three people in Riga is studying. The city has eight institutions of higher education, sixteen technical schools, one hundred and fifteen schools, twenty-two trade schools, seven music schools, and a school of applied arts. Thousands upon thousands of Riga citizens are studying in workers' night schools, the Marx-Lenin Institute, and the Communist Party and Communist Youth League groups and political schools.

In the five years since Riga's liberation, more than one billion rubles have been used to rebuild the city of Riga, which was severely damaged by the German fascist aggressors. Now, Riga has beautiful parks and gardens, as well as newly built embankments along the Daugava River. The city has become more beautiful and majestic than ever before. More than 75,000 working people spent their holidays at the Riga seaside resort this year.

　　迎接十月革命节
    乌克兰拉脱维亚两共和国经济文化建设均获新成就
    【新华社北京三十一日电】基辅讯：苏联乌克兰共和国的劳动人民，在创造性、建设性的劳动气氛中纪念了共和国从希特勒匪帮统治下解放五周年纪念日（十月十四日），并准备迎接十月革命三十二周年纪念日（十一月七日）。
    乌克兰劳动人民在战后复兴工作与发展中已获得了巨大的成就。在工业方面：本年第二季，乌克兰钢铁工业已比去年同期多生产了百分之三十八的铣铁和百分之五十五的钢。机器制造工业正在顺利发展，现在，已制造出干线机车、采矿合机、切煤机、改良收割联合机、全部用金属制造的打谷机、复式金属加工车床和极端精确的测量器械。苏联最大的煤田顿巴斯煤田，现已接近于战前的产煤水平，不久就将完成从水淹的矿坑里（这些矿坑绝大多数都已开工）抽出五万万立方公尺水的浩大工程。五年计划完成时，全苏每年将产煤二亿五千万吨，其中，顿巴斯即产煤八千六百一十万吨，占全苏煤产量的三分之一强。
    “达沙瓦——基辅”煤气管第一段的敷设，已经竣工。二万间基辅市民的住宅和共和国首都最大的企业，都使用着来自喀尔巴阡山脉的天然煤气（这是一种最便宜的燃料）。
    在农业方面，已获得了进一步的重大成功。播种谷物的地区，已达到五年计划规定在一九五○年应达到的面积。今年，谷物和工业原料、蔬菜与饲料均告丰收。乌克兰已向伟大的斯大林报告提早完成纳粮计划的情形。共和国的许多州所缴纳的谷物，比战前最好的年成所缴纳的还要多。苏维埃乌克兰集体农场以提早完成一九四九年发展牲畜业计划来庆祝共和国解放五周年纪念。集体农场所有的食用牛和乳牛的头数，已大大超过战前的水平。
    乌克兰的城镇与村庄，正纷纷修建房屋。在战后，城镇与工人住宅区里，已修葺或新建了二千一百万平方公尺的房舍。在村庄里，已有八十五万五千间房屋落成了。
    教育、科学、文化及其他各种机关，也有显著的进展。今年学校开学时，有六百四十万学童，比战前多五十万。一百五十九所高等教育机关的学生，达十三万五千名以上。
    【新华社北京二十六日电】里加讯：苏联拉脱维亚共和国及其首都里加的劳动人民，最近正以经济和文化上的新成就，来纪念里加从希特勒匪帮侵占下解放的五周年，并迎接即将到来的十月革命节。
    里加城内的八个区中，已有五个区光荣地实现了他们的保证，提前完成了五年计划。另外三个区也正迅速接近他们的目标。在今年的九个月中，工业生产量比一九四○年全年多生产百分之八十六点五，比一九四五年约增加五倍。里加各企业部门中，已有三千以上的工人已经完成了他们的五年计划定额，同时，约有二千工人已在制造列在第二个及第三个五年计划中的产品了。在过去五年中，共和国的工业已经转化，新建立的工厂已在制造拉脱维亚从未制造过的产品，里加工业中的机器制造和电机制造所占比重，较一九四五年增加了二倍多，电力火车、电车、强力的电动机、庞大的自动干线电话站、活动发电厂，以及各种各样的头等机器与器械，正在里加的作坊和工厂制造中。
    里加城每三人中有一人在学习，城内有八个高等教育机关，十六个技术学校，一百一十五个学校，二十二个贸易学校，七个音乐学校，和一所实用艺术学校。成千成万的里加市民在工人夜校、马列学院以及共产党和共产主义青年团的小组和政治学校学习。
    自里加解放后的五年中，有十亿卢布以上的款项被用来重建被德国法西斯侵略者所大肆破坏的里加城。现在，里加城已经有了美丽的公园和花园，以及沿陶加瓦河岸新建的堤防。这个城市比以往已变得更为秀丽雄伟了。七万五千以上的劳动人民，今年到里加海滨胜地度过了他们的假日。
