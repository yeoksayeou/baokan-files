　　Organizing Surplus Winter Labor Force
    Beijing to Construct Several Projects
  　Municipal Government Orders All Districts to Conduct Registration and Organization
    [Beijing News] As winter approaches, the Municipal People's Government has recently decided to complete three earthwork projects and repair the earthen roads in various hutongs and sidewalks on various streets before the ground freezes. At the same time, to provide employment opportunities for residents in urban and suburban districts with surplus labor during the winter, it has been decided that district public offices (or district governments) will immediately begin registering and organizing the surplus winter labor force to carry out the aforementioned projects. The three earthwork projects are: (1) dredging the Royal River within the boundaries of the Fifth and Sixth Districts; (2) building the roadbed for the road from the North Palace Gate of the Summer Palace to Northwest Wang; (3) building the roadbed for the road from the new urban area to the Summer Palace. These three projects are scheduled to start within the week, requiring a total of 4,940 workers per day and are expected to be completed in ten days. The compensation is four jin of millet per cubic meter of excavated earth, with an average person able to excavate two cubic meters of earth per day, earning eight jin of millet. The project of repairing the earthen roads in various hutongs and the sidewalks on various streets has already begun. The compensation is four jin of millet per 20 square meters of smoothed road surface or 40 square meters of smoothed sidewalk. In addition, the Municipal Construction Bureau, in order to collect crushed stone needed for road construction next year, will conduct quarrying and crushing stone from the 15th of this month to the end of January next year, requiring 850 workers per day, also using the above method. Residents of each district who wish to participate in the above labor can quickly register at their respective district public office (or district government).
