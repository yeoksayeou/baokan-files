Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 10th: TASS, New York, 9th: The National Committee of the Communist Party USA issued a statement on the 32nd anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, stating: "The Soviet Union is a force for peace and progress, a powerful socialist country that has eliminated capitalist exploitation and national oppression." Currently, the people of Eastern European countries and the Chinese people, who have established the People's Republic of China, are advancing along the socialist road illuminated by the Soviet Union. Hundreds of millions of people in the rest of Eurasia and the Americas are also struggling for a socialist future free from fascism and the threat of war.

The National Committee of the Communist Party USA pointed out that the key to world peace lies in friendship and cooperation between the world's two largest countries—the Soviet Union and the United States—and pointed out that "the Cold War was not launched in Moscow, but by Wall Street and the highest military authorities in the United States, who dreamed of an easy victory in an atomic blitz."

The statement also stated: "The Soviet Union follows an unwavering policy of peace because it is a socialist country ruled by the working class... The very nature of this socialist country is resolutely opposed to aggression and war."

The CPUSA National Committee called on Americans to reject Wall Street's war propaganda. The statement concluded by pointing out that in order to commemorate the thirty-second anniversary of the Soviet revolution, we must develop the struggle for peace, defeat the conspiracies of the warmongers, "establish a people's united front for peace to strive for Soviet-American friendship. Abandon the North Atlantic Treaty and conclude a peace treaty with the Soviet Union. Let the people's call for peace resound throughout our country."

    美共在十月革命节发表声明
    号召人民建立统一阵线
    争取苏美友好要求和平
    【新华社北京十日电】塔斯社纽约九日讯：美国共产党全国委员会于伟大的十月社会主义革命三十二周年发表声明称：“苏联是和平与进步的力量，是消灭了资本主义剥削与民族压迫的强大社会主义国家。”目前，东欧各国人民以及建立了中华人民共和国的中国人民，正循着为苏联所照明的社会主义道路迈进。欧亚其余地方及美洲的亿万人民，也在为免于法西斯主义与战争威胁的社会主义前途斗争。
    美国共产党全国委员会指出：世界和平的关键在于世界两个最大国家——苏联与美国——间的友谊与合作，并指出，“冷战不是在莫斯科发动的，而是由华尔街与美国最高军事当局所发动与进行的，他们梦想在原子闪击战中轻而易举地获胜”。
    声明又称：“苏联遵循着坚持不渝的和平政策，因为它是工人阶级所统治的社会主义国家……这一社会主义国家本身的性质就是坚决地反对侵略与战争的”。
    美共全国委员会号召美国人拒绝华尔街的战争宣传。声明在结尾时指出，为了纪念苏联革命的三十二周年，我们必须发展和平斗争，击败战争制造者的阴谋，“建立人民和平统一战线，以争取苏美友好。废弃北大西洋公约，与苏联缔结和平公约。让人民要求和平的呼声响彻我国”。
