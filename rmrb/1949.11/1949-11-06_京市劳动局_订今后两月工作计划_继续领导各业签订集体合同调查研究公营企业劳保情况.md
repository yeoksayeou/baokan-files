Formulates Work Plan for the Next Two Months

Continue to Lead Various Industries in Signing Collective Contracts, Investigate and Study Labor Insurance Conditions in Public Enterprises

[Beijing News] The Municipal Labor Bureau, based on the central work plan of "taking the lead in signing collective contracts as the main task, continuing to mediate and arbitrate labor-capital disputes, and starting the investigation of labor insurance conditions in public enterprises in the city to gradually establish a labor insurance system," has formulated specific work tasks for November and December.

The bureau, with reference to the work plan of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Preparatory Committee, stipulates that in the next two months, it will complete: leading the signing and separate approval of labor-capital collective contracts in the weaving and dyeing, match, carpet, shoe, barber, oil, salt and grain, and small kiln industries; and leading the labor-capital sides of bathhouses, cloth, department stores, Western medicine, tea, vegetable market, hospitals, ironworkers, chemical industry, kiln, machine dyeing, sewing, handmade paper, glass, and oil basket industries to conduct consultations and discussions, so that they can quickly establish collective contracts or temporary agreements. At the same time, it will conduct investigations to understand the situation of other industries, and according to the specific situation and needs of each industry, convene various meetings, such as symposiums, research conferences, and contract approval conferences, to persuade and educate both labor and capital, so that they can further understand policies, eliminate concerns, and then sign collective contracts, and strive to develop production. For the four industries that have signed collective contracts and the labor-capital dispute cases that have been mediated or arbitrated in the past, the bureau will use direct investigation and convening symposiums to deeply check the specific implementation of both labor and capital, understand the impact on production, and the reactions of both labor and capital and the society, so as to conduct research and summarize experience, and lay the foundation for signing collective contracts and collectively mediating labor disputes next year.

In the next two months, the bureau will continue to investigate and study the labor insurance situation of public enterprises according to the original plan, in order to prepare for drafting a draft labor insurance regulation in accordance with the decrees of the Central People's Government, and to handle and conclude the employment work of unemployed workers.

  　订今后两月工作计划
    继续领导各业签订集体合同调查研究公营企业劳保情况
    【北京讯】本市劳动局根据“领导签订集体合同为主继续进行调解仲裁劳资纠纷，开始本市公营企业劳保情况调查，以逐渐建立劳保制度”的中心工作计划，订出十一、十二两个月的具体工作任务。
    该局参照市总工会筹委会的工作计划，规定在今后两个月中将完成：领导签订并分别批准织染、火柴、地毯、鞋业、理发、油盐粮、小窑等行业的劳资集体合同；并领导浴堂、布业、百货、西药、茶叶、菜行、医院、铁工、化学工业、窑业、机染、缝纫、手工造纸、料器、油篓等行业的劳资双方，进行协商讨论，使能迅速成立集体合同或临时协定。同时，分别进行调查了解其他行业的情况，并根据各业的具体情况和需要，召开各种会议，如座谈会、研究会、批准合同大会等，对劳资双方进行说服教育工作，使其进一步了解政策，消除顾虑，进而签订集体合同，努力发展生产。对于已经签订集体合同的四个行业和过去调解或仲裁的劳资纠纷案件，该局将用直接调查及召集座谈会等方式，深入检查劳资双方具体的执行情况，了解对生产影响如何，以及劳资双方与社会反映等，以进行研究和总结经验，为明年签订集体合同与集体调解劳资争议打下基础。
    今后两个月中，该局仍照原计划继续调查研究公营企业劳保情况，以准备遵照中央人民政府的法令草拟劳保条例草案，并处理与结束失业工人的就业工作。
