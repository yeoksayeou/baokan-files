　　The United States is Precisely the Center of New War Preparations
　　Austin Cannot Refute This Fact

　　Following Vyshinsky's speech, the American representative Austin took the floor, his purpose clearly being to diminish the profound impression Vyshinsky's speech had made on people, or at least to somehow justify the Anglo-American opposition to the Soviet Union's fair and noble proposals. The American representative could not offer any arguments to refute the convincing facts cited in Vyshinsky's speech. He did not even dare to attempt to answer several facts proving that the American ruling clique is preparing for a new war and obstructing all international efforts to ensure international peace and cooperation. Austin read his speech according to a pre-prepared script, a speech which proved that the United States had already decided to oppose the Soviet proposals even before the Soviet Union had specifically explained them to the committee.

　　The American representative could not refute the fact that the center of new war propaganda and new war preparations is precisely the United States. He merely said that the Soviet proposal had a so-called "provocative nature," although it is well known that the real provocation is not the condemnation of war-mongering activities by the instigators of a new war, but rather the war instigation coming from a very small number of new war instigators in the United States and Britain. The American representative came out against the prohibition of atomic weapons, using the excuse that, under pressure from the Anglo-American bloc, a majority of representatives in the United Nations General Assembly had already rejected this proposal last year.

　　The American representative opposed the Soviet proposal to conclude a Five-Power Pact to strengthen peace, insisting that such a pact was superfluous, given the existence of the United Nations Charter.

### 美国正是新战争准备中心  奥斯汀无法反驳这一事实

　　美国正是新战争准备中心
    奥斯汀无法反驳这一事实
    美国代表奥斯汀继起发言，他的目的显然是想削减维辛斯基演说所给予人们的深刻印象，至少是想用某种办法来辩解美英对苏联公正而高尚的提案的反对。美国代表无法提出任何论据来反驳维辛斯基演说中所援引的令人信服的事实。他甚至不敢试图答复若干事实，这些事实证明了美国统治集团正在准备新战争，正在阻碍国际间为保证国际和平合作而进行的一切努力。奥斯汀按照预先拟就的底稿读出他的演说，这篇演说证明美国甚至在苏联还没有向委员会具体说明苏联提案之前，就已经决定反对苏联的建议。
    美国代表无法反驳这一事实，即新战争宣传和新战争准备的中心，正是美国。他仅仅说：苏联提案具有所谓“挑衅性质”，虽然尽人皆知真正的挑衅不是对新战争挑拨者的战争挑拨活动的谴责，而是来自美国和英国极少数的新战争挑拨者的战争煽动。美国代表出来反对禁止原子武器，借口是：在美英集团的压力之下，联合国大会中的多数代表已经在去年否决了这一建议。
    美国代表反对苏联所提缔结五强公约以加强和平的建议，硬说既有联合国宪章，此种公约就是多余的。
