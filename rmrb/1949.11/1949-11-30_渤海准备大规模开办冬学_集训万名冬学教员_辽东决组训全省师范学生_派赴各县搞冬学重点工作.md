　　[Our Shandong Correspondent] To prepare for the large-scale launch of the winter school movement, all 42 counties (cities) in the Bohai region are universally training winter school teachers. According to statistics from 36 counties, a total of 9,330 winter school teachers have been trained. The training work is under the unified leadership of the winter school committees established by each county. Most counties are holding the training in two phases, each lasting about ten days. The first phase in each county generally concluded in mid-month, and the second phase is currently underway. The sources of winter school teachers in each county are elementary and middle school teachers, rural intellectuals selected by the masses, outstanding students from schools, and cadres stationed in villages. Regarding the methods of mobilizing winter school teachers, according to a survey of various counties in the Lubei Special District, those elected by the masses accounted for 80% in Deping and 30% in Shanghe; those mobilized by rural cadres after they matured and agreed by the masses accounted for 50% in Shanghe. However, there were also some undesirable phenomena such as substitutions and temporary forced conscriptions. In terms of educational content, general education on current affairs, production, democracy, and culture was implemented. The Lubei Special District also had responsible cadres from each county give mobilization reports, so that everyone could understand the important significance of winter school work, and then conduct studies on politics, business, and teaching methods. After the study, except for a few who were not enthusiastic due to immature mobilization or forced conscription and substitution, most were able to attach importance to social education and were very satisfied to have the opportunity to learn. The training of winter school teachers throughout the region will be largely completed in late this month, and a large-scale winter school movement throughout the region will be universally launched at the end of the month. Since governments at all levels generally attach importance to this work, the CPC local committees and special commissioner's offices have successively established winter school committees, issued instructions to each county on holding winter schools, and researched and formulated plans for launching the winter school movement in each special district. The Cangnan CPC local committee and special commissioner's office also convened a joint meeting of the propaganda ministers of the CPC county committees and the education section chiefs of the county governments to study and formulate a resolution on launching the winter school movement, deciding to open 2,400 to 2,800 winter schools throughout the special district.
    [Our Northeast Correspondent] The Liaodong Provincial Winter School Committee was established on the 14th, with the provincial government's education department bearing the main leadership responsibility to promote the winter school movement throughout the province. The Education Department recently decided to transfer 14 cadres to Fengcheng County to carry out pilot work, in order to gain experience and guide the overall situation. The Education Department also decided to organize students from provincial and county normal schools, provide them with short-term training, and send them to various counties to carry out key winter school work. The first phase is to organize 200 people, led by cadres transferred from the Education Department, to work in southern Liaoning, northern Liaoning, Tonghua, and other places.

　　渤海准备大规模开办冬学
  　集训万名冬学教员
    辽东决组训全省师范学生  派赴各县搞冬学重点工作
    【本报山东通讯】为准备大规模开展冬学运动，渤海全区四十二个县（市）正普遍集训冬学教师。据三十六个县统计，共集训冬学教师达九千三百三十名。集训工作，由各县成立冬学委员会统一领导，大部分县分两期举办，每期十天左右，现各县第一期普遍于本月中旬结束，第二期正在进行。各县冬学教师来源，为各县高初小教员，群众选出的农村知识分子、学校优秀学生、驻村工作干部等。在冬学教师动员方式上，据泺北专区各县调查，经群众选举的，德平占百分之八十，商河占百分之三十，乡村干部动员成熟后经群众同意的，商河占百分之五十，但亦有部分顶替和临时拉夫来的不良现象。在教育内容上，一般均贯彻了时事、生产、民主、文化等教育。泺北专区并由各县负责干部作动员报告，使大家了解冬学工作的重要意义，然后进行政治、业务和教学法等学习。经学习后，除个别因动员不成熟及拉夫、顶替来的情绪不高外，一般均能重视社会教育，自己得到学习机会，非常满意。全区冬学教师集训将于本月下旬大致完成，月底全区大规模的冬学运动即可普遍展开。由于各级政府一般重视了这一工作，各中共地委、专署均先后成立了冬学委员会，向各县发出了举办冬学的指示，并研究制订了各专区开展冬学运动的计划。沧南中共地委、专署并召开了各中共县委宣传部长、县府教育科长联席会议，研究制定了开展冬学运动的决议，决定全专区开办两千四百处至两千八百处冬学。
    【本报东北通讯】辽东省冬学委员会已于十四日成立，由省府教育厅负主要领导责任，推动全省冬学运动。教育厅顷决定抽调十四名干部到凤城县搞试点工作，以吸取经验，指导全面。教育厅并决定组织省县立师范学校学生，施以短期训练，派赴各县搞冬学基点工作。第一期准备组织二百名，由教育厅抽调干部率领，分赴辽南、辽北、通化等地工作。
