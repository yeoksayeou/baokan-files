No sooner had Little Foreign Devil finished speaking than the meeting erupted in a cacophony of noise. This meeting was being held in the former enemy and puppet village government office at the Old Lord Temple. The room was large, with a roaring fire in the stove, yet the forty or fifty people present still felt scattered. Some huddled around the stove, others stood in the sunny doorway, and still others clustered around the windowsills and tables. The women squeezed onto the brick bed against the wall at the far end of the room, with a few others scattered on the floor. People in each cluster talked amongst themselves, some saying, "Production? What's so cheap about carrying rock? Old Yin already arranged it, what's there to discuss!" Others chimed in, "Exactly! Carrying two loads a day and earning two catties of rice, what's not to do? Even if you wear out a pair of straw shoes, it's nothing!" Still others asked Little Foreign Devil, "Is there any advantage to carrying sand from Little West Village?" Little Foreign Devil replied, "How could there not be an advantage? It's just that the amount of advantage isn't fixed." Someone else interjected, "No way! No matter how good it is, it won't be more than a catty of rice a day. Besides, we're discussing the whole village's affairs, can you have everyone go carry sand?" After this burst of noise, someone suddenly shouted, "What production, what production! Let's just divide up the clothes, furniture, and cash! Divide it up and enjoy the fruits! After we've eaten it all, let everyone do what they want!" Bian Xiao immediately retorted, "That's not right! How many days can you eat the fruits? Even if we say let everyone do what they want, there still has to be something to do!" Following this, most people said, "Production is still the most important thing." Then people began to argue, sometimes loudly, sometimes softly. After a while, someone said, "Given our terrain, there's no high-level method for production; isn't it just digging coal mines? Old Yin's arrangement wasn't to have us think of ways to open the mines? In the end, it all comes back to that." But someone else said, "I heard that Comrade Yin is afraid of the difficulties involved in opening the mines, that he's asking us to think of ways to deal with the difficulties! Let's talk about what the difficulties are first!" Below, someone whispered, "Hua Da's Old Yin is a good man! He's afraid opening the mines will be difficult, so he keeps telling us to discuss it properly, he means well! But he's an old bumpkin from Hebei, they irrigate with water over there, one mu is worth ten of ours, they raise pigs, run flour mills, spin yarn, and weave cloth very cheaply in the winter, but he doesn't understand mines! Mines, with capital, with someone to manage, just do it! What difficulties are there!" "I also heard that he's afraid opening the mines will delay work! But if he delays our work in the black mines, that's a real problem!" "Bah! I think Old Yin just doesn't know our situation! Take carrying rock, it's a small matter if it doesn't make money; but tell me, I've been digging coal my whole life, can my shoulders carry that?"... The meeting was a mess, with people chattering in groups here and there. The women huddled together, heads touching, not knowing what they were saying. Little Foreign Devil listened here and there, saying "That's right!" and "Is that so!" After a while, the whole room erupted in noise, so loud that no one could hear a single word. People smoked dry tobacco, filling the room with smoke. Someone, choked by the smoke, ran to the door, covering his stomach and coughing, his face red and his veins bulging. Another person, preoccupied with talking, accidentally smoked a mouthful of tobacco oil, spitting and wiping his mouth while violently shaking the tobacco pipe to get rid of the oil. The room was so hot it felt like it was packed with people. This continued for three or four mealtimes. Quan Cheng, hearing that everyone had said nearly enough, finally called for everyone to quiet down and begin the formal discussion.

But now, no one spoke much, only a few scattered voices saying, "We've had several meetings! Every time, we've said the same things, what else is there to say!" "Quickly, let the government lend us capital, find someone to manage, and get things moving! What difficulties, what difficulties!" "Or forget it! Let's hurry up and divide the clothes, furniture, and cash!" Suddenly, Tian Lu stood up from a corner of the room and walked towards the stove, saying, "I don't think there's anything else to say! Let's just think of a way to borrow capital and open Brother Xi Lu's big mine! If we need a lot of capital, we'll build water drainage and ventilation shafts, or just build water drainage, which won't be as much trouble as digging a new mine. Let's discuss it with Brother Xi Lu, pick a few skilled workers to go down the mine and figure things out, make a plan, and see how much capital we need in the end! Once we have a plan, we can discuss it with Old Yin when he comes back, wouldn't that be easier? What do you all say? I'm not good at talking..." People argued for a while, then someone said, "Let's do that! Without a plan, we could argue for three years and it wouldn't help! We can't discuss any difficulties. Let's start picking people!" Xi Lu, who was also attending the meeting, said, "That's right! Let's pick people! I think Da San counts as one!" People began to noisily pick people. Quan Cheng remembered that he hadn't seen Da San for quite some time. He had originally planned to discuss opening the mine with Da San specifically, but he had been too busy. These days, Da San was never home. Quan Cheng knew that Da San must have had some objections to opening the mine! So he said to everyone, "I think we should have the old experienced miners who opened this big mine, let our Uncle Da San lead the calculation!" Seeing that Tai Cheng was sitting next to him, he asked Tai Cheng, "Do you think it's okay? You're also an old experienced miner from this big mine! Brother Tai Cheng, you should be one too! Help us calculate everything properly." Tai Cheng said coldly, "Are we clear about this?" At this moment, someone at the window sill by the table loudly proposed, "Let's have our Uncle Tian Lu as one! Uncle Xi Lu as one! And our Tai Cheng as one! Does everyone agree?" People shouted in unison, "Agree!" Tai Cheng suddenly jumped up onto a bench and shouted, "I can't! I'm the one who ruined this mine, I have no right to speak. Besides, I just don't think this mine is safe!" These words silenced the meeting. After a while, Liu Gou's wife stood up from the brick bed inside and said, "Quan Cheng! In my opinion, the Old Lord God caused trouble in this big mine! We can't be completely unprepared!" Little Foreign Devil also said, "Quan Cheng, it's not that I disagree with you! We're doing this for everyone, but we can't be careless!" Tian Lu began to sigh to himself, "Oh, this, this..." But many people felt that gods and ghosts were probably nothing, especially Quan Cheng's brothers and their gang, who shouted, "What this and that! There are no gods, no ghosts, no fate in the world! That was a long time ago, who knows who was playing tricks! Haven't you changed your minds yet? Are you still feudal-minded?" The meeting became lively again. Quan Cheng's brother suddenly jumped onto the stove, waving his arms and shouting, "If we keep arguing like this, I don't think our mine will ever work! In my opinion, let's not say anything else! Let's just have our Uncle Da San, Uncle Tian Lu, and Uncle Xi Lu calculate it first, and let's have our Brother Tai Cheng not be stubborn, and be one too! Besides, we have another idea: don't be afraid of not having capital! Can't we use the cash from our fruits first? This is the opinion of all of us young people, that's all!" After saying that, he jumped off the stove, and the meeting erupted like water gushing out of a mine, so loud that it couldn't be stopped. People talked about gods and ghosts, and tried to persuade Tai Cheng to join the mine calculation, and also talked about cash. Even Lin Bao and Bian Xiao, who didn't usually speak much, anxiously shouted, "Oh no! This cash is hard to say!" "Who can decide this!" Quan Cheng, seeing that he couldn't control the meeting, was worried when Bai Quan's wife squeezed out of the crowd and pulled him aside. He followed her out, and the woman led him to the slope behind the temple, looking around anxiously, then stared blankly at Quan Cheng, making Quan Cheng's heart pound, not knowing what was going on.

　　黑石坡煤窑演义（４２）
    康濯
    小洋鬼的话音刚落，会上就立时哇啦哇啦地咯吵起来了。这个会是在老君庙上过去敌顽村公所办公地点开的，这屋子很大，生了一炉大火，四五十号人占着也还是稀稀拉拉地：人们火炉跟前一圪堆，门口太阳地里一圪堆，窗台跟前桌边一圪堆，妇女们就挤着坐在屋子最里边靠墙的铺柜上，地下也还有零零散散圪＠着的几个人。人们同一圪堆的你跟我说他跟你说，只听有人道：“生产嘛，挺便宜的营生还不就是担硔？老尹早就安插好的，还讨论个球！”又有人说：“就是嘛！一天担两遭，挣二斤米，这还不能干么？穿破双把鞋也算不了个啥呀！”还有人问小洋鬼道：“担小西庄的砂货有闹头么？”小洋鬼道：“怎么没闹头？只不过闹多闹少的不准定就是。”不知是谁却接话道：“不行！再好吧一天也多不过斤把米；再说咱这讨论的是浑村的事，你能让一村人都去担砂货？”这么咯嚷了一阵，忽地有个什么人大声嚷道：“什么生产不生产的！快分衣裳家具现洋吧！分了就吃果实吧！吃完了谁爱干啥就干啥呗！”扁小却立时接话道：“这可不对付！你果实能吃几天啊？就说谁爱干啥干啥吧，可也得有干的呀！”跟着，多数的人也说：“生产可到底还是头份大事。”人们就又一阵紧一阵慢地咯吵起来。一会，有人说：“咱这地势，别有什么生产的高法；还不就是个钻煤窑？老尹安插的不也是叫咱们想法开窑？说来说去，再说也还是个这。”但有人道：“听说尹同志就是怕开窑作难的事多，他是叫咱们想法对付困难哩！先说有啥困难吧！”下边就有人悄悄说：“华大老尹可是个好人！他怕开窑作难，老是一个劲叫咱们好好讨论，也是个好心！可他是个河北老侉，他们那边尽水浇地，一亩顶咱十亩的，他们冬天喂猪开粉房纺线织布便宜的很，可他不懂窑！窑嘛，有了垫本，有了人张罗，就干嘛！有什么困难不困难的！”“还听说他是怕开窑耽误工作哩！可他要耽误了咱窑黑的窑，那才是正经大事哩！”“咳！我看老尹这老侉就是不摸咱们的底！就说担硔吧，不挣钱倒还是小事；你说我一个刨炭刨了一辈子的，我这肩膀能担么？”……会场上这里一铺摊那里一铺摊，吵个不清。妇女们是几个脑袋挤在一堆不知说些什么，小洋鬼却这边听听，说声“对呀！”那边听听，说句“是嘛！”一会，不知为什么满屋子都吵嚷开了，嚷得一句话也听不清，人们抽旱烟又把一屋子熏得烟雾腾腾地，不知是谁被烟气呛得一边往门口跑，一边手捂着肚子咳嗽咳得脸红筋跳；还有一个人只顾说话，抽旱烟不提防抽了一嘴烟油，一边不住地“呸呸”吐唾沫，一边抡着旱烟管一下一下使劲往下摔烟油，屋子里直烘火得象挤满了人一般。这么直咯嚷了三两顿饭工夫。拴成听大伙意见许差不多了，才吆喝大家静下来正式讨论。
    这时却反倒没什么人说话，只零星有人说：“会也开了好几回啦！每回也都是说的这，还有啥说头哩！”“快快地让公家借垫本，找人张罗，动弹开了再说！什么困难不困难的！”“要不就拉倒！拾掇着快分衣裳家具现洋吧！”忽然，天禄从屋子角落站起来往火炉跟前走去，一边说：“别的我看也就甭说啦！还是想法借垫本开喜禄哥那大窑吧！垫本要多嘛，咱就打水透风筒，要不，光打水也比刨新窑费不了事。咱们跟喜禄哥商议商议，挑几个把式下窑去合计合计，安上个谱谱，看到底得多少垫本能行！赶咱们有了谱谱，老尹回来一商议，不就便宜了？大伙说对么？咱是不会说……”人们咯嚷了一气，就有人说：“就这吧！要没个谱谱，瞎咯吵三年也不顶！啥困难也讨论不出。咱们往出挑人吧！”喜禄也参加了这个会，他说：“这可是对！挑人吧！我看咱大三就算一个！”人们都咯嚷着挑开了人，拴成却想起他又是好些时没跟大三捣拉了，开窑的事，他原也打算过要跟大三专一商议商议的，后来忙得也没有做；这些时大三又是整日不在家，拴成知道：大三准又是对开窑有了意见！于是他对大伙说：“我看咱们还是叫开这大窑的老把式，叫咱大三叔领头来合计吧！”他见泰成这时正坐在他旁边，就又问泰成：“你说行么？你也是这大窑的老把式哩！泰成哥，你也算一个吧！你给咱也好好合计个底底。”泰成却冷冰冰地说：“咱可就闹清了么？”这时窗台跟前桌边有人大声提出：“咱天禄叔也算一个！喜禄叔也算一个！还有咱泰成也算一个！大伙同意不同意？”人们嚷得一片响：“同意！”泰成却猛一把跳起来站到凳子上吆喝道：“咱不行！咱是闹坏了这窑的，可没咱说话的份。再说，咱看着这窑还就是不保险哩！”这一席话把会场闹了个安安静静，谁也没话了！一会，柳沟家从里边铺柜上立起来说：“拴成！依着咱说吧，这大窑老君爷还闹过事哩！咱们就一点也不防着！”小洋鬼也道：“拴成，这可不是我不同你的意！咱们为大伙办事情，可也就是不能稀里马虎！”天禄却一个人欢息起来：“唉，这这……”但不少的人却觉得什么神呀鬼的许也没事，特别是拴成他兄弟那伙子还嚷道：“什么这个那个哩！世上就没神没鬼没命！那老年的事，还不定是什么人捣鬼哩！你们莫非还没翻心？还是封建大脑？”会场又热闹起来，拴成他兄弟忽然一股劲跳到火炉上边立着，挥着胳膊吆喝道：“老这么咯吵着，我看咱们这窑就永世也闹球不行！依着我说，咱们甚也甭说啦！就让咱大三叔天禄叔喜禄叔先来合计一下，还有咱泰成哥也甭闹蹩，也算一个！特外咱还有个意见：不怕没垫本！咱们果实里头的现洋，不兴先垫着再说？这可是咱青年们大伙的意见，没啦！”说完，他跳下火炉，会场上跟着却象大窑刨出了水一般，吵响得哗啦啦怎么也制不住；人们说神的说鬼的，还有打劝泰成叫他也参加合计闹窑的，又加上说现洋的，就连不大说话的林宝和扁小，也急得乱嚷：“哎呀呀！这现洋可难说哩！”“这谁能作主啊！”拴成眼见会场没法掌握，正愁的没法，忽然白泉家从人缝里挤出来，拉了他一把，他跟着走了出去，那女人却一直把他引到庙后的坡坡上，很象担惊受怕地前后左右察看到一阵，就两眼愣愣地瞅着拴成，闹得拴成心眼直卜通，不知怎么回事。
