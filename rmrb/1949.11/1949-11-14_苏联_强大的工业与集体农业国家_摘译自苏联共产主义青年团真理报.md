(1) A Powerful Socialist Industrial Nation
　　Soviet industry has long been the world's leading nation in terms of development speed. Several years before the Second World War, industrial productivity surpassed Britain, France, and Germany, becoming number one in Europe. In 1940, our powerful industry increased production by about twelve times compared to 1913.
　　The main sectors of Soviet industry and the national economy are heavy industry, that is, those sectors that manufacture hardware, fuels, machinery, and other means of production. The development of heavy industry, especially the machine-building industry, makes it possible for us to equip light industry, transportation, and agricultural economy with new technologies, helping to complete the socialist transformation of the entire Soviet national economy. The vigorous development of industry made it possible for us to equip the army with the necessary armaments, thereby achieving victory over fascist Germany and imperialist Japan.
　　One of the main industrial sectors is the coal industry. Under Soviet power, the coal industry has undergone great changes. Numerous new coal-producing areas have been discovered and determined, and huge coal mines have been established. Old coal picks have been replaced by pneumatic drills, mechanical coal cutters, coal mining combines, and cranes. At the beginning of the Great Patriotic War, our coal production increased by five and a half times compared to 1913. Our primary coal base is Donbas. The Hitler invaders greatly damaged the coal industry of Donbas, flooded the coal mines, and dismantled many of the internal facilities. After the fascist invaders were driven away, the workers of the Donets Basin unanimously carried out repairs, and their labor in this regard achieved great success. Our other important coal areas are Kuzbass (in western Siberia, southeast of Novosibirsk), Karaganda (northern Kazakhstan), the Moscow River downstream basin, and other areas. The coal industry in the post-war Stalin Five-Year Plan has been significantly improved. In 1940, the Soviet Union produced 166 million tons of coal, but the goal for the last year of the Five-Year Plan is to produce 250 million tons. Coal miners assured Comrade Stalin that they would reach the 1950 production level of the Five-Year Plan in December 1949.
　　The Soviet oil industry is of great significance. Before the revolution, oil was extracted from open wells using narrow buckets. The Soviet oil industry now has superb technology. Oil is pumped from underground strata with pumps. Oil workers are also studying how to extract oil from the seabed. Oil production is increasing year by year. In 1913, only 9 million tons of oil were produced, while in 1940 our country produced 31 million tons of oil. Our main oil-producing areas are in Baku, in Grozny and Maikop (both in the North Caucasus), in the Ob River (Kazakhstan), Sakhalin Island, near the Carpathian Mountains (western Ukraine), and other places. The oil area known as "Second Baku" is developing rapidly. This entire industrial array is lined up on the vast area between the Ural Mountains and the Volga River - Tuimazy, Shimbay, Ishimbay, Krasnokamsk, Yuguria, Buguruslan and other places. Oil refining here only began after the establishment of Soviet power. At the end of the Soviet post-war Five-Year Plan, the annual oil production is planned to be 35.4 million tons.
　　Natural combustible gas obtained from underground is a valuable fuel like oil. Now, gas flows through gas pipelines more than 800 kilometers long from Saratov (north of Stalingrad) to our nation's capital, Moscow, and directly from the Carpathian Mountains to the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. Leningrad obtains gas from the combustible rocks of Estonia extracted from the southern coast of the Gulf of Finland via gas pipelines. The vast majority of fuel in the Soviet Union is sent to power plants.
　　Lenin once said about the significance of electrification: "Communism is Soviet power plus nationwide electrification." The Soviet Union's power generation exceeds that of pre-revolutionary Russia many times over. In 1913, the national power generation was approximately 2 billion kilowatt-hours, but by the last year of the post-war Five-Year Plan, our power plants are planned to generate 82 billion kilowatt-hours. Many of our power plants use river water (white coal) to generate electricity. The construction of hydropower stations in our country only expanded under Soviet power. The Dnipro Hydroelectric Station (in Ukraine), which the Soviet people regard as glorious and which was destroyed by Hitler, has been rebuilt. The post-war Five-Year Plan will build new and powerful hydropower stations. In addition, many small hydropower stations will be established to supply collective farms and small cities.
　　Our country has also built a powerful ferrous metallurgy industry. Before the war, the production of pig iron had increased to about four times the production level of pre-revolutionary Russia (this was a pig iron production of about 15 million tons in 1940, compared to 4 million tons in 1913). In the last year of the Soviet post-war plan, 19.5 million tons of pig iron should be produced according to the plan.
　　The first coal and iron base in the Soviet Union is in the south, where there is a large group of smelting and mining industries in the Ukrainian Republic (Donbas, Dnipro River Basin, Azov River Basin). The smelting and mining industries in the south were brutally destroyed by the fascist invaders. Now, the industry in the south has been successfully restored and is remanufacturing many metals. Under the initiative of Comrade Stalin, a second coal and iron base was built in the east of the Soviet Union (the Ukr-Kuznetsk (southeast of Novosibirsk) joint enterprise). There are many iron ore deposits in the Ural Mountains, but there is not enough coal to smelt iron. Conversely, there is a lot of coal in Kuzbass. For this reason, the transportation of pig iron began on the railway more than 2,000 kilometers long from the Urals to Kuzbass, and coal was transported from Kuzbass to the Urals on the same railway. This formed the largest smelting industry combination in Magnitogorsk, Nizhny Tagil, Chelyabinsk (all three are located on the east side of the Ural Mountains) and Kuzbass. In the post-war Five-Year Plan, the Kuzbass area will develop and exploit its own iron ore deposits. The Soviet Union has also built a powerful new type of non-ferrous metal industry, which includes copper, tin, zinc, aluminum, nickel, and precious metals indispensable for steelmaking.

    苏联——强大的工业与集体农业国家
    ——摘译自苏联共产主义青年团真理报——

  （一）强大的社会主义工业国家
    苏维埃工业在发展的速度上很早已在世界上占第一位。工业生产力早在第二次大战前几年就超过了英、法、德，而成为欧洲第一位。一九四○年，我们强大的工业约比一九一三年的生产增加十二倍。
    苏联工业和国民经济的主要部门是重工业，就是那些制造五金、燃料、机器和其他生产工具的部门。重工业的发展，特别是机器制造业，使我们可能给轻工业、运输和农业经济配备新的技术，帮助完成苏联全部国民经济的社会主义改造。工业的大力发展，使我们可能给军队配备必需的武装，从而得到对法西斯德国与帝国主义日本的胜利。
    主要工业部门之一是煤炭工业。煤炭工业在苏维埃政权下经过了很大的改变，发现了并确定了不少新的产煤区，建立了巨大的煤矿，并用气锤机、机械凿煤机、采煤联合机和起重机等代替了古老的煤镐。伟大的爱国战争开始时，我国煤的生产量与一九一三年相比是增加了五倍半。我们第一产煤基地是顿巴斯。希特勒侵略者曾大大地破坏顿巴斯的煤炭工业，用水淹没了煤矿，拆毁了内中许多设备。法西斯侵略者赶走后，顿尼兹盆地的工人全体一致进行修理工作，他们在这方面的劳力得到了极大的成就。我国其他重要的煤炭区是库兹巴斯（在西部西伯利亚，新西伯利亚城东南），卡拉干达（哈萨克北部），莫斯科河下游盆地及其他地区。战后斯大林五年计划中的煤炭工业是显著的提高了。一九四○年苏联生产一亿六千六百万吨煤，但五年计划最后一年的目标则将生产二亿五千万吨，煤矿工人向斯大林同志保证在一九四九年十二月达到五年计划中一九五○年的产量水准。
    苏联石油工业有着重大的意义，革命前开采石油是从地下开口的井中用狭长的提桶汲上来的，苏维埃石油工业现在已具有高超的技术，石油用抽水机从地层下抽上来。石油工人并研究从海底下提取石油。石油产量一年一年的增大，一九一三年只生产九百万吨石油，而一九四○年我国则生产了三千一百万吨石油。我们主要产油地是在巴库、在格劳兹尼和迈科普（两地均在北高加索）、在鄂毕河（哈萨克斯坦）、库页岛、喀尔巴千山（乌克兰西部）附近和其他地方也有石油工业。被称为“第二巴库”的石油区迅速的在发展着，这整列的工业就排在乌拉山和伏尔加河之间的广阔地区上——都依马兹依、色姆巴巴斯基、理亚克拉斯诺、卡姆斯克、依古利亚、布古鲁斯兰及其他地方。这里提炼石油是有了苏维埃政权后才开始的。苏联战后五年计划结束时，每年石油的产量按照计划应为三千五百四十万吨。
    从地层下取得的天然可燃的煤气，是和石油一样有价值的燃料。现在，煤气在八百多公里长的煤气管中从萨拉多夫（斯大林格勒北）一直通到我们国家的首都莫斯科，从喀尔巴千山边直通到乌克兰的首都基辅，列宁格勒则从煤气管中得到遥远的芬兰湾南岸爱沙尼亚的可燃岩石中提取的煤气。苏联极大部分的燃料是送往发电站的。
    列宁对电气化的意义曾说过：“共产主义是苏维埃政权加上全国电气化”。苏联发电工作超过革命前的俄国许多倍。在一九一三年全国发电力约为二十万万千瓦时，但到了战后五年计划的最后一年，按照计划我们的发电站将发电八十二万万千瓦时。我们许多发电厂是用河水（白色的煤）发电的。在我国水力发电站的建设只有在苏维埃政权下才扩展，被希特勒破坏的苏联人民引为光荣的第聂伯河水电站（在乌克兰）已经重建完成。战后五年计划将建造新的强大的水电站。此外，并将建立许多小型的水电站，供应集体农场与小城市。
    我国又建设了强大的黑色冶金工业，在战前铣铁的生产已增加到约为革命前俄国生产水准的四倍（这是一九四○年约为一千五百万吨的铣铁产量，与一九一三年四百万吨的对比）。苏联战后计划的最后一年，按照计划应生产一千九百五十万吨铣铁。
    苏联第一煤铁基地是在南方，这里有大群乌克兰共和国的冶炼工矿（顿巴斯、第聂伯河流域、阿速流域）。南方的冶炼工矿曾受到法西斯侵略者的残暴破坏，现在南方的工业已成功地恢复并在重新制造许多金属。在斯大林同志创导下，在苏联建筑了第二个位于东方的煤铁基地（乌克尔——库兹尼兹（新西伯利亚城东南）联合企业）。在乌拉尔山有许多铁苗，但用来熔铁的煤不够，在库兹巴斯相反的却有许多石炭。因为这个原因，从乌拉尔到库兹巴斯二千多公里长的铁路上开始运送铣铁，而由库兹巴斯向乌拉尔在同一铁道上输送石炭，这样组成了在马格尼多高尔斯克、下塔吉尔、车里亚宾斯克（以上三地均在乌拉尔山脉东侧）和库兹巴斯的最大冶炼工业组合。在战后五年计划中，库兹巴斯区将发展开掘自己的铁苗。苏联也建有强大的新型的有色金属工业，它包括铜、锡、锌、铝、镍，还有炼钢所不能缺的名贵金属。（未完）
