Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 4th: According to TASS, New York: The Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly resumed discussion of the so-called Greek question on October 27th. By October 29th, the discussion had shown a trend unfavorable to the United States and Britain, who are truly responsible for raising this issue at the current session of the General Assembly. The delegations of the Soviet Union, Poland, Ukraine, and some other countries cited many clear and specific facts and figures to prove that the open interference of the United States and Britain in the internal affairs of Greece, and their military and political intervention in Greece, are the main causes of the current civil war and disaster in Greece.

After the head of the Soviet delegation, Vyshinsky, delivered a speech on October 27th, he spoke again on October 28th on the report of the so-called Balkan Committee on the Greek question. Vyshinsky analyzed in detail this report, the records of the "observers" group, and the so-called "witness certificates," proving that the activities of the Balkan Committee, established by the United States in violation of the UN Charter and manipulated by the United States to benefit itself, have the sole purpose of shifting the responsibility for the current situation in Greece from itself to Albania and Bulgaria. Vyshinsky further proved that the materials and arguments contained in the report of the Balkan Mediation Committee are full of loopholes, placing the committee itself and its defenders in a shameful and often ridiculous position. The materials of the Balkan Committee cannot serve as a basis for making any decision on the Greek question.

After condemning the provocative statements of Bebler (the representative of the Tito government, who slandered the Soviet Union's peace-loving policy in his speech) and the arbitrary remarks of the representatives of the United States, Britain, and other countries, Vyshinsky said: "The Soviet delegation insists that the withdrawal of American and British troops and military missions from Greece is the most important condition for the normalization of the situation in Greece. The Soviet delegation insists that the Balkan Mediation Committee must be disbanded, because it will only cause harm and force the United Nations to complicate the relations between Greece and its northern neighbors. This is our position on the so-called Greek question."

　　苏联代表团宣布对希问题立场
  　坚持撤退美英干涉军队
    联大政委会否决英国污蔑性提案
    【新华社北京四日电】据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会政治委员会于十月二十七日恢复所谓希腊问题的讨论。至十月二十九日，讨论的情形已表现不利于在联大本届会议中提出这个问题的真正应负其咎的美国和英国。苏联、波兰、乌克兰及其他某些国家的代表团，引了许多明确而具体的事实和数字来证明：美国与英国之公开干涉希腊内政，美英之在希腊进行军事干涉与政治干涉，是希腊目前的内战与灾难的主因。
    苏联代表团团长维辛斯基于十月二十七日发表演说之后，十月二十八日又对所谓巴尔干委员会关于希腊问题的报告发言。维辛斯基详细分析这个报告、和“观察员”小组的记录以及所谓“见证人的证书”，证明违反联合国宪章的由美国动议而建立的巴尔干委员会之活动，受美国操纵以利于美国自己，它的唯一目的，就是把对希腊现状应负的责任，从自己身上推卸到阿尔巴尼亚和保加利亚的身上。维辛斯基更证明，巴尔干调解委员会的报告中包含的材料和论据，漏洞百出，使委员会本身和它的辩护人处于可耻并且常常是可笑的地位。巴尔干委员会的材料不可能作为对希腊问题作出什么决定的根据。
    维辛斯基在斥责了贝勃勒（铁托政府的代表，在发言时毁谤苏联爱好和平的政策）挑衅性的声明和美英等国代表的武断言辞后，说：“苏联代表团坚持，自希腊撤退美国和英国的军队与军事使团，是希腊情况正常化最重要的条件。苏联代表团坚持必须解散巴尔干调解委员会，因为它只会招致损害，并迫使联合国走上使希腊与其北方邻国的关系更形错综复杂之途。这就是我们对所谓希腊问题的立场。”
