    Beijing News: The English teacher Redland, a British national at the private Chongde Middle School in Beijing, insulted student Lu Zuyi on the 8th of this month, causing great anger among all teachers and students. Yesterday (the 11th) at 3:00 PM, the school's teachers, students, and staff held an accusation meeting against Redland for insulting the Chinese people. Representatives from Beijing University, Mu Zhen Girls' Middle School, Bei Man Girls' Middle School, the male and female affiliated high schools of the Teachers' College, the Municipal Boys' and Girls' Middle School No. 1, the Yiwen Middle School, the Duzhi Girls' Middle School, and the Xinsheng Middle School, as well as representatives from the Middle and Primary School Teachers' Union, participated, totaling approximately 500 people. First, Lu Zuyi, a junior middle school student from the school, recounted the experience of being insulted. The incident occurred during English class from 3:00 PM to 3:50 PM on the 8th of this month. Because Lu Zuyi spat on the floor, it triggered Redland's unreasonable behavior. He cursed at Lu Zuyi, saying: "Chinese people never pay attention to hygiene, 81 percent of them have lung disease. It's not surprising that foreigners put up signs like 'Chinese and dogs not allowed' at the entrances of parks and restaurants in Shanghai before liberation. It is because the Chinese are too dirty and just like dogs!" While scolding, he spat randomly, splattering saliva on the faces of the students sitting in front of Lu Zuyi. Redland's open act of insulting the Chinese people has aroused great anger among all teachers, students, and staff of the school. Students from various classes, staff members, and representatives of the school's "Fellowship" have all accused Redland of consistently bullying students, demanding that Redland be handed over to the People's Court for punishment. In their speeches, student representatives from various schools unanimously pointed out that Redland's behavior was not only an insult to Lu Zuyi alone, but also an insult to all Chinese youth and the Chinese people. Finally, everyone unanimously advocated for suing Redland's crimes in the People's Court.
