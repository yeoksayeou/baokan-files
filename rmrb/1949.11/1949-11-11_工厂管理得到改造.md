    Factory management methods and systems, as well as the thinking of technical personnel, have also undergone preliminary transformation during the movement. The old labor organization and machine allocation have been adjusted first, making the connection between various processes more reasonable, thus greatly reducing the waste of labor time in waiting for work and materials. In terms of the production system, the original irregular and formalistic work ticket system (the work ticket is a sign recording the amount of work content and the complexity of work methods for each worker) has become more accurate due to the addition of recorders and the cooperation and assistance of technicians. And through the establishment of supplementary tickets, liaison tickets, and team work tickets, this important basic production record is gradually being made more scientific. The product inspection system is now stricter than before. Statistical work in production departments (individual, workshop, and even the entire factory's various processing stages) and management departments (including indirect production material statistics, etc.), as well as cleaning up warehouses, inventory checks, and raw material requisition systems, have been initially established. The planning department has received the deepest education. The formulation of production plans has progressed from making plans based on vague estimates or from a conservative point of view to determining production tasks based on the efficiency of each machine tool and the man-hours of each processing stage. Due to this series of improvements, especially the scientific management of work ticket records and raw materials, it will gradually lead to the realization of a cost accounting system. The advancement of the movement will inevitably further urge the continued change of management methods in order to keep pace with the movement.

    For workers and trade unions, the educational significance of this movement is equally profound. Workers have seen clearly from the actual development of the movement that the wage policy of more pay for more work and the gradual increase in wages can only be achieved by highly developing individual initiative and technical capabilities to improve and develop production, thus dispelling concerns. Because the trade union has begun to combine with the production movement, especially in organizing workers to sign collective contracts and achieving success, it has established unprecedented prestige among the workers. Workshop employee branches and employee groups have been established and enriched with work, with short and concise meeting lives. The number of members has increased from 455 in July to 812.

    工厂管理得到改造
    工厂管理方法和制度以及技术人员思想，也在运动中得到初步改造，旧的劳动力组织和机器配备首先经过了调整，使各工序合理衔接，因而大大减少了等工待料中劳动时间的浪费。在生产制度上，原来不正规陷于形式主义的工票制度（工票是记载每个工人工作内容之多少，工作方法的繁简的标志）由于增加了纪录员，以及技术员的配合协助，已经比较确实并且通过补助票，联络票及小组工票等之建立，使这一个重要的基本生产纪录逐渐科学化。产品检验制已较前严格。在生产部门（个人、车间以至全厂的各加工过程）和管理部门的统计工作（包括间接生产之材料统计等）以及清理仓库、清查盘存、原材料领发票制度等均初步建立。而得到教育最深的是计划部门。生产计划的制订，已从笼统的估计作计划，或从保守的观点作计划，进到根据每台机床的效率，每个加工过程的工时，而确定生产任务。由于这一系列的改进，特别是工票纪录与原材料的科学管理，将逐渐引向成本核算制度的实现。而运动之向前推进必然会进一步督促管理方法之继续改变，方能与运动合拍。
    对工人和工会来说，这一运动的教育意义同样是深切的，工人对多劳多酬的工资政策以及只有高度发挥个人的积极性和技术能力提高发展生产中才能得到工资上的逐步提高，已从运动的实际发展中看清，因而清除了顾虑。因为工会已开始同生产运动结合，特别在组织工人订立集体合同并获得成功中在工人里建立起前所未有的威望。车间职工分会和职工小组都建立起来并充实了工作，有了短小精干的会议生活，会员人数由七月份的四五五人，增为八一二人。
