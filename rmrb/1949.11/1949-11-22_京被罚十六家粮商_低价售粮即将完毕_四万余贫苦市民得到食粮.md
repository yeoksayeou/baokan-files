　　Sixteen Grain Merchants in Beijing Penalized
　　Low-Price Grain Sales Nearing Completion
　　Over 40,000 Impoverished Citizens Receive Grain
    [Reported by this newspaper] The sixteen private merchants in Beijing who sold grain at the November 8th price, as penalized by the Municipal Government, began formally selling on the 18th. The grain that the Municipal Government ordered to be sold includes 5,700 bags of flour and 127,500 jin of coarse flour. It is being sold through the organized efforts of the trade union to 45,000 impoverished members, ten jin per person (not counting family members). The method is that the trade union issues grain purchase certificates, one per person, and grain is purchased upon presentation of the certificate. After the purchase is completed, the grain purchase certificate is handed over to the business for safekeeping and the accounts are reported in aggregate. Local police stations are also dispatching personnel to maintain order. Those benefiting from this preferential grain purchase are mainly impoverished transportation workers, construction workers, and handicraft workers (dyeing, soap making, alkali production, etc.). The types of grain being sold: coarse grains include millet, sorghum rice, corn flour, millet flour, broomcorn millet, mung beans, soybeans, and processed miscellaneous grain products. Fine grains include macaroni, second-class flour, and third-class flour. The price is based on the November 8th retail price, generally half the market price. As of the 20th, ten businesses, including Dongxinghao Flour Mill, Yuanfengjiu Rice Store, Chengji Rice Shop, Gongnonghao, Tianheli, and Yufengfuji Grain Store, have sold out their prescribed amounts, and the money has been handed over to the People's Bank for processing. It is estimated that all sales will be completed this afternoon.
