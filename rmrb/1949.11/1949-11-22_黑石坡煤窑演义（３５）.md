　　The Black Stone Slope Coal Mine Story (35)
　　Kang Zhuo
　　After several days, the district office still hadn't sent anyone. The Niu Bao gang of self-defense corps members were again rampaging through the village like they used to when they came down from the blockhouse to demand grain and money. One day, Da San even saw Niu Bao and his gang and Tai Cheng carrying water out of the small pit at the west entrance of the big kiln. Da San rushed to the kiln entrance and asked, "What are you doing?" Niu Bao tilted his neck and said, "What are we doing? Drawing water! Opening the kiln!" Da San ignored him and turned to ask Tai Cheng, "Did you ask anyone? How are you planning to do this?" Niu Bao interrupted, "Do we need to ask? This is now communist! Whatever we do is our kiln! Who can bite my balls?" Tai Cheng said, "It was Yu Bao who told us to do this. He went to the district and asked, and they said it was okay to open it." Da San didn't say anything, but he was seething inside, thinking: I have to ask Lao Bai! See what the rules are now! Could it be that it's still the world of the traitors?
　　But as soon as Da San got home, Shuan Cheng ran over to tell him that someone from the district office had come, surnamed Wu. Sure enough, after a while, they heard the bell ringing at the temple, and heard Yu Bao shouting on the hillside behind the temple for people to go to the bottom of the theater to have a meeting. Shuan Cheng said, "Let's go! Let's see what's going on." Tian Lu walked over from the neighboring kiln and said, "Old San, don't go! Who knows what's going on?" Shuan Cheng said, "It doesn't matter, let's take a look and come back." So the two of them left.
　　This time, only thirty or forty people came to the meeting from the village of two hundred households. The Wu guy from the district spoke to everyone, saying things like liberation, the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army are saving the people, the poor people should settle scores and seek revenge to emancipate themselves, fight against the traitors, landlords, and local bullies who oppress and exploit people, and that anyone with mistakes should confess, and confessing will be treated leniently. Finally, he told everyone not to be afraid, to report grievances and seek revenge, and to be sure to raise any opinions... Then, Yu Bao confessed, saying that he was forced to be a village policeman for two days by traitors and local bullies. Niu Bao also said that he was caught by the die-hard army and forced to be in the self-defense corps for a few days, suffering all kinds of bullying from the die-hard army. Niu Bao's sister-in-law also ran onto the stage, twisting her head and saying a few words. Later, the Wu guy said that everyone should unite, elect five committee members, and it would be best to elect a woman; Niu Bao's gang of self-defense corps members clamored that Yu Bao, Lin Bao, Niu Bao, and Niu Bao's sister-in-law should be elected. Someone else shouted to elect Little Foreign Devil. Little Foreign Devil was so frightened that his lips were trembling, and he shouted, "I can't do it! What committee am I supposed to be on! I… I can't read or speak, I can't… can't do it!" Lin Bao also kept shouting, "Oh! I'm old and stupid..." Afterwards, somehow, those five people were considered elected, and people became chaotic. Da San took the opportunity to pull Shuan Cheng away.
　　The next day, the committee members went to each household to ask for opinions, saying that Comrade Wu from the district knew that Qian Danao was a running dog of the traitorous rich man Zhang Jubao and that Qian Danao should be arrested and struggled against. Little Foreign Devil ran to Shuan Cheng and Da San's adobe kiln, explained things to the people for a long time, and told them that they must go to the general meeting, or Yu Bao would punish them. Then, Little Foreign Devil said worriedly, "But who knows how to do this! Look, I'm really unlucky! Uncle Da San, you must go to the meeting! Otherwise, Yu Bao will say that I didn't tell you. Alas! But how to struggle against him! And what are opinions! Hey, everyone in the village is doing the same thing..." Little Foreign Devil kept talking endlessly. Da San said, "Okay! You go and do your thing, we'll be sure to go to the meeting when the time comes." Only then did Little Foreign Devil sigh, saying that he still had to tell that area and those families to go to the meeting to raise opinions, and that he had to prepare for some things. Finally, he said, "But who knows what this so-called emancipation is! Alas..." Muttering like this, he left with a worried look on his face.

　　　　Thirty-Two False Struggle

　　In a few days, a general meeting was held in the whole village. Tian Lu went that day, but Da San and Shuan Cheng did not go.
　　That day, Da San and Shuan Cheng were squatting under a large tree on the hillside behind the Liugou family's courtyard, looking at the theater stage. They saw that there were one or two hundred people going to the meeting. Yu Bao was acting as the chairman on the stage, and Lin Bao was also up there, with a table in front of him, listening to Comrade Wu's instructions and writing something. Little Foreign Devil was running up and down; Qian Danao was tied up and standing on the stage. Below, Niu Bao led his gang of self-defense corps members shouting slogans: "Down with the traitorous landlords and rich men!" "Qian Danao quickly confess your mistakes!" Niu Bao's sister-in-law also shouted for the women to follow along. After a while, Yu Bao shouted for everyone to give Qian Danao their opinions, but no one below made a sound. After a while, Niu Bao was the first to go up and say two things. Yu Bao shouted again, "Whoever gives an opinion gets to share the spoils!" Niu Bao's gang went up and said a few things. Finally, Yu Bao himself shouted and yelled at Qian Danao, and kicked Qian Danao twice. Qian Danao then confessed for a while, and kowtowed to the people twice, and the meeting let him go. After that, Yu Bao asked the people below, "Does anyone else have any opinions about anyone? Speak up! We must overthrow personal feelings!" So Niu Bao suggested that Xi Lu eat rent rice, use long-term workers, lend money, and exploit people by rolling coal, that he was a landlord and rich man and should be struggled against. Niu Bao's gang shouted in agreement: "Agreed!" Immediately, Xi Lu was arrested, and a rope was found to tie him up. Several other people went up and gave two opinions. Later, Comrade Wu gave a speech, Niu Bao shouted slogans, and the meeting was chaotic... Shuan Cheng said to Da San under the tree, "What is this all about!" Da San glared and waved his arms, shouting straight at the theater stage: "I fuck your mother!"
　　The settlement of scores and revenge struggle in Black Stone Slope Village ended like this. The next day, the committee members went to Jubao's house and made a ruckus, taking thirty bags of grain, eighty silver dollars, and some clothes and furniture; it was said that not much could be found in Xi Lu's house, and only some scattered grain and clothes were taken. At this time, Comrade Wu's seven-day work period expired, and he returned to the district. Yu Bao then convened another meeting, saying that the policy of the Eighth Route Army was to equalize land and share property. So more than a dozen families with more land and surplus grain voluntarily contributed some grain and land, and even Lin Bao took out three acres of land. Then they divided the spoils. Yu Bao was in charge of everything, Niu Bao weighed the goods, Lin Bao kept the accounts, Little Foreign Devil called people, and Niu Bao's sister-in-law took over a pile of clothes and wouldn't let anyone see them; Yu Bao told them how much grain to give to whoever they gave it to, and the clothes and furniture were decided by drawing paper balls, and whoever drew something got it; it was said that a few silver dollars were lost, but no one saw the ones that weren't lost being divided. After a few more days, Yu Bao allocated the land that had been seized, giving a few acres to you and a few acres to him. Even if someone didn't want the land, he had to give it to them. If someone wanted it but didn't dare to ask, they wouldn't get it.

　　黑石坡煤窑演义（３５）
　　康濯
    过了好几天，区里办公的总不见来，牛宝那伙子自卫团，却又象过去从炮楼上下来催粮款那样，在村里凶虎虎地乱撞，有一天，大三还见牛宝那伙和泰成在那大窑的西口小坑里往出担水；大三赶到窑口问道：“这干啥哩？”牛宝歪着脖子道：“干啥？打水！开窑！”大三不理他，转问泰成道：“你们问谁来着？你们盘算怎么闹法？”牛宝抢着说：“还用问？这如今共产！咱动弹就是咱的窑！谁还能咬了我个球？”泰成却说：“这可是玉宝让咱们动弹的。他去区里问过，说是让开。”大三没言声，心里头却气冲冲地盘算着：得找老白问问！看如今到底是个啥规章！莫非还是汉奸们的天下？
    但大三刚走回家，拴成就跑来告他，说是区里来了个办公的，姓武。果然，一会就听见庙上敲钟，听见玉宝在庙后边山坡上吆喝人们去戏楼底开会；拴成说：“走！看看去。”天禄却从隔壁窑里走来说：“老三，甭去啦！谁可知道是怎么回事啊？”拴成说：“不吃紧，看看就回。”他二人便走了。
    这回开会，二百来户的村子只到了三四十号人，区里那个姓武的给大家说话，什么解放啦，共产党八路军民主政府打救老百姓啦，穷人要清算复仇翻身，要跟压迫人剥削人的汉奸地主恶霸斗争啦，还有什么谁有错误要坦白，坦白了宽大，最后就叫大家不要怕，有冤报冤有仇报仇，有意见一定要提……接着，玉宝就坦白，说他被汉奸恶霸逼迫当了两天村警；牛宝也说他是被人家顽军抓上炮楼当了几天自卫团，受尽了顽军的欺负；牛宝他嫂也跑上戏楼，脑袋一扭一扭地说了几句什么。后来姓武的又说叫大家抱团体，选五个委员，最好还要选个妇女；牛宝那伙自卫团的就咯嚷一气，要选玉宝、林宝、牛宝和牛宝他嫂，不知还有谁又吆喝要选小洋鬼，小洋鬼吓得直哆嗦着嘴唇嚷道：“咱可不行！咱知道委什么员啊！咱……咱一不识字二不会说话，咱可……可不行呀！”林宝也直嚷：“哎呀！咱这人老心笨的……”随后，不知怎么一来，那五个人就算选成了，人们也乱起来了，大三趁机就拉着拴成走了。
    第二天，就见委员们上各家各户叫提意见，说是区里武同志知道乾大脑是汉奸财主张聚宝的走狗，要把乾大脑抓回来斗争。小洋鬼跑到拴成大三们的土窑那边，交代了人们半天，并叫人们一定去开大会，不去的玉宝说要罚；接着，小洋鬼又愁楚地说：“可谁知道怎么折腾啊！你看，我这算是背兴透啦！大三叔，你可得去开会呀！要不，玉宝又要说我没说给你们。唉！可怎么斗争啊！可什么叫意见啊！嗨，一村人，都干的一手营生的……”小洋鬼一说又没个完，大三道：“行啦！你忙去吧，咱到时候准开会去。”小洋鬼这才叹息着，说着还有那一片那几家得去告给叫开会提意见，还有什么什么事得打点准备，最后又说：“这可谁知道是叫怎么个翻身解放啊！唉……”这么噜嗦着，愁眉苦脸地走了。
    　　　　三十二　假斗
    没几天，全村开起了大会。那天天禄倒是去了，大三和拴成却没有去。
    那天，大三拴成二人，在柳沟家院子后边半坡上的一株大树下圪＠着，看着戏楼这边，只见去开会的人有一二百，玉宝在戏楼上当主席，林宝也在上边，就着个桌子，听武同志吩咐写着什么，小洋鬼在跑上跑下；乾大脑被捆绑着立在戏楼上，下边牛宝就领着他那伙自卫团喊口号：“打倒汉奸地主老财！”“乾大脑赶快坦白错误！”牛宝他嫂也吆喝妇女们跟着喊。一会，玉宝嚷着叫大伙给乾大脑提意见，下边却没一个人啃气，呆了一阵，牛宝才头一个上去说了两条什么，玉宝就又嚷道：“谁提意见谁分果实！”牛宝那伙就又上去几个说了说，最后玉宝自己就对着乾大脑又喊又叫地嚷了一通，并踢了乾大脑两脚，乾大脑接着便坦白了一顿，又给人们叩了两个头，会上就这么把他放了。以后，玉宝又问下边：“大伙还对谁们有意见？快提！咱们要打倒情面！”于是牛宝就提出：说喜禄吃租米用长工放帐滚窑剥削人，是个地主老财，该着斗争；牛宝那伙子跟着一声吆喝：“同意！”立时就把喜禄抓了来，还寻了根绳捆起了，又有几个什么人上去提了两条意见；后来就是武同志讲话，牛宝叫口号，会场一阵乱……拴成在这边树下对大三道：“这是闹什么啊！”大三却瞪着眼挥着胳膊，对戏楼那边直嚷：“我肏你妈的！”
    黑石坡村的清算复仇斗争就这么结束。第二天委员们就去聚宝家闹了三十来口袋粮食，八十块现洋，还有些衣裳家具；喜禄家里听说是搜不出多的东西，就粮食、衣裳都零零星星闹了点。这时武同志七天工作满了期，回区去了，玉宝却又召开了个大会，说是八路政策叫均地共产，于是又有十来家地土多的和有存粮的自动出了些粮食和土地，连林宝也拿出了三亩地。接着就分果实，玉宝总管一切，牛宝掌秤，林宝记帐，小洋鬼叫人，牛宝他嫂包揽着一堆衣裳不让人看；分粮是玉宝叫分给谁多少就多少，衣裳家具是抓纸球，抓了哪件算哪件；现洋听说是丢了几块，但没丢的也没见分。又过了些天，玉宝又把闹出来的土地你拨几亩他拨几亩，有不要地的也非给不行，有想要却不敢问讯的，也就不给了。
