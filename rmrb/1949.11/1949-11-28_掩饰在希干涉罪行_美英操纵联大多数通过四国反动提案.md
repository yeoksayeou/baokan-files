Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 27th: According to TASS, New York: The United Nations General Assembly discussed the Greek issue on the 17th and 18th. Due to the manipulation of the US-British bloc majority, the General Assembly rejected the Soviet proposal to call on the warring parties within Greece to cease fire, and the Soviet proposal to call on the Greek government to declare amnesty. The General Assembly passed the so-called "Four-Power Proposal" put forward by the representatives of the United States, Britain, Australia, and the Kuomintang, which aims to cover up the US-British intervention in Greece and allow the situation in Greece to continue to escalate.
　　Although the Soviet proposals were rejected by the US-British voting machine, the two-day discussion in the General Assembly has further exposed the evil conspiracy of the US-British reactionaries in directing the Greek royalist fascists to launch an anti-people civil war and expand against Bulgaria and Albania before the people of the world. Representatives of the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Poland and other countries delivered speeches at the meeting, denouncing the false arguments of the US and British representatives. The head of the Soviet delegation, Vyshinsky, pointed out in his speech that US representative Cohen could not present any facts to deny the repeated arguments put forward by the Soviet delegation, namely, that the United States is establishing military bases in Greece, turning Greece into a bridgehead for US aggression against Europe, and distributing US officers to Greek government and military organs. They also could not present any facts or evidence to support the report of the so-called "Balkan Mediation Committee." Vyshinsky firmly advocated that the United Nations should urge the Greek government to revoke the death sentences against the nine leaders of the peace and democratic movement. He pointed out that the majority who rejected the Soviet proposal were actually supporting the Greek government in swiftly shooting Greek patriots. The head of the Ukrainian delegation, Manuilsky, pointed out in his speech that the Greek government is continuing to execute large numbers of democrats. He particularly emphasized that the US and British representatives opposed preventing the Greek government from sentencing the leaders of the democratic movement to death because every sentence in Greece is permitted by Wall Street. Manuilsky declared: "World public opinion can now understand that in Greece, every execution leaves blood on the hands of US representative Cohen and British representative McNeil."

　　掩饰在希干涉罪行
  　美英操纵联大多数通过四国反动提案
    【新华社北京二十七日电】据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会全体会议于十七、十八两日讨论希腊问题。由于美英集团多数的操纵，大会否决了建议联大呼吁希腊国内交战双方停战的苏联提案以及建议联大呼吁希腊政府宣布大赦的苏联提案，大会并通过了由美国、英国、澳大利亚与国民党代表提出的所谓“四国提案”，这个提案旨在掩饰美英在希腊的干涉行为，而一任希腊局势继续紧张化。
    虽然苏联的提案遭到美英表决机器的否决，但是，联大两天的讨论，却已进一步在世界人民面前暴露了美英反动派指挥希腊保皇法西斯分子，发动反人民内战与对保加利亚与阿尔巴尼亚进行扩张的罪恶阴谋。苏、捷、波等国的代表，曾在会上先后发表演说，痛斥美英代表的虚妄言论。苏联代表团团长维辛斯基的演说：指出美国代表柯亨提不出任何事实可以否认苏联代表团历次提出的论断，即美国正在希腊建立军事基地，正在变希腊为美国侵略欧洲的桥头堡垒，而且正在把美国军官分布在希腊的政府与军事机关中。他们也提不出任何事实与证据来支持所谓“巴尔干调解委员会”的报告。维辛斯基坚决主张联大力促希腊政府取消对九位和平民主运动领袖的死刑判决。他指出，拒绝苏联这一建议的多数派，实际上就是拥护希腊政府迅速枪杀希腊爱国者的人。乌克兰代表团团长曼努意斯基在发言中指出希腊政府正在继续处决大批民主分子。他特别强调美英代表之反对阻止希腊政府对民主运动领袖之判处死刑，是因为希腊每一次的判决都是得到华尔街的许可的。曼努意斯基宣称：“世界舆论现在可以明白，在希腊，每一次的处死，都在美代表柯亨与英代表麦克奈尔的手上留下了血迹。”
