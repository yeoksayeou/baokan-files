    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 7th] TASS, Moscow, 6th: The celebration of the 32nd anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution was held at the Moscow Grand Theatre on the evening of November 6th.
    The Grand Theatre, on this joyous festival, appeared particularly solemn and magnificent. The spacious entrance of the theatre was hung with the national flags of sixteen union republics. The best people of the capital—famous Stakhanovite workers and scientists, heroes of socialist labor, engineers and artists, old fighters of the revolutionary struggle, builders of new cities, and heroic Soviet army combatants—gathered in this place to hold the annual celebration.
    Hanging above the stage of the Grand Theatre was a long banner of golden characters, which read: "Celebrating the 32nd Anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution." The front of the stage was hung with giant portraits of Lenin and Stalin, set in wreaths of fresh flowers.
    At exactly 7 p.m., a long burst of applause broke the silence of the venue, welcoming the arrival of the great leaders of the Communist Party and the Soviet government to the podium. They were Comrades Molotov, Malenkov, Beria, Voroshilov, Bulganin, Kaganovich, Andreyev, Shvernik, Kosygin, Suslov, Ponomarenko, Popov, Shkiryatov, and other government officials and representatives of the Moscow Soviet.
    The celebration, hosted by the Moscow Soviet in conjunction with representatives of the Party, public organizations, and the Soviet Army, was inaugurated by Popov. The Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), headed by Comrade Stalin, was elected as the honorary presidium amidst warm applause.
