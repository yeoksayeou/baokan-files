Political Economy Tutorial Introduction (25)
    The Object, Task, and Characteristics of Political Economy Research
    Chapter Two: Economic Movement and Economic Laws (Principles)
    Section Three: Economic Movement and Laws (Principles) of Economic Movement
    Economic laws exist within economic phenomena, and it is necessary to grasp the laws by looking through the phenomena.
    Social economic laws are inherently present in social economic phenomena. To understand and grasp economic movement, we must first examine it from economic phenomena and discover the laws of economic movement. However, we must never mistake economic phenomena for economic laws; otherwise, we will be unable to understand and grasp the essence of economic movement. To understand and grasp economic movement, we must understand and grasp its inherent laws by looking through the phenomena. Because economic phenomena are constantly changing, and the forms they take are extremely complex, there are certain inherent laws governing the changes within these various complex phenomena. Therefore, we must discover and explore its laws from these complex phenomena to truly and profoundly grasp its essence and not be deceived by the phenomena. Take the law of price as an example; the circulation of goods follows the law of price, that is, goods always flow from places with low prices to places with high prices. Under conditions free from economic obstacles, merchants must circulate goods from places with low prices to places with high prices according to this law of price to obtain profits. This is regardless of the merchant's level of awareness; they are always subject to the law of price. Therefore, whether goods circulate from east to west or from west to east, although the direction of circulation changes indefinitely, the law governing the economic movement of goods still plays a role and does not change.
    The Importance of Discovering and Mastering the Laws of Economic Movement
    Social economic laws naturally exist within social economic phenomena. When people have not yet recognized them, it seems as if they exist externally and are opposed to people, and people are blindly and passively subject to their control. If people's economic activities can adapt to economic laws, economic activities can proceed smoothly. Conversely, if people's economic activities cannot adapt to these laws or even violate them, economic activities will encounter obstacles, setbacks, and losses. An old Chinese novel tells the story of a person doing business who found selling pigs and sheep separately quick, but when he sold them together, he encountered trouble. This is a good example.
    Of course, we say that being able to adapt to economic laws is good, but it is not easy to specifically grasp economic laws. For example, during the financial contraction in Shijiazhuang in the autumn of 1948, both large and small producers felt it was difficult to do business. Hearing that yarn was expensive in Xingtai, they all flocked there to sell yarn, resulting in a large supply but little demand, and the price dropped. Many people encountered setbacks and returned empty-handed. This means that although these producers understood some "business acumen" and grasped a little of the law of price, they still did not fully understand the law of price, so their activities were still blind. Therefore, when we have not yet recognized the laws of economic movement, we can only blindly obey them. But when we recognize them, in addition to being able to obey them, we can also consciously use them, control them, master them, and dominate them. Only when we can use, control, master, and dominate the laws of economic movement can these laws serve us and benefit our economic activities and economic development. For example, under the New Democratic economy, if prices rise sharply in a certain area, it will not truly suppress the price increases if we do not transport goods to adjust the supply and demand but use price controls to limit them. To stabilize prices there, we must allow goods to circulate there. Of course, this is one aspect of stabilizing prices, and there may be many other methods, such as cracking down on merchants' manipulative hoarding and ensuring that economic work between regions and departments is synchronized (synchronized economic work between regions and departments is also very important for stabilizing prices, as this can give price stabilization strength and prevent it from being weakened due to dispersed forces and unsynchronized steps), and so on. In short, stabilizing prices requires a conscious, planned, unified, and coordinated effort to master the laws of price. As for simple price control policies that do not pay attention to increasing the supply of goods to adjust supply and demand, they violate the laws of price. In the future, our state-owned trading companies will stabilize prices through supply and marketing cooperatives, using great efforts to supply goods, which can overcome the blindness of spontaneous market laws (principles). However, the extent to which we master prices and the market will depend on the size of our economic strength, the distribution of economic organizations, and the degree to which we master economic laws.

    政治经济学教程绪论（２５）
    政治经济学的研究对象任务及其特点
    第二章  经济运动与经济规律（法则）
    第三节  经济运动与经济运动规律（法则）
    经济规律存在于经济现象中，必须透过现象去把握规律。
    社会经济规律是内在地存在于社会经济现象中的。我们要了解把握经济运动，首先必须从经济现象中来考察，来发现经济运动的规律，但是绝对不要把经济现象认做了经济规律，否则就无法了解和把握经济运动的本质。我们要了解和把握经济运动必须要透过现象去了解把握它的内在的规律。因为经济现象是不断的在变动着，它表现的形式非常错综复杂，但在这各种复杂的现象中存在着一定的内在的规律，支配着它的现象的变动。所以我们必须从这些错综复杂的现象中发现探求它的规律，才能真正的深刻的把握它的本质，不致为现象所迷惑。比如以价格规律为例；商品流通是按照价格规律流通的，即商品总是由价格低的地方向价格高的地方流的，商人必须按照这个价格规律，在不受经济以外的阻碍的条件下，把商品从价格低的地方向价格高的地方流通，才能够获得利润，这是不管商人意识的程度如何，它总是要受这价格规律支配的。所以商品无论从东向西流通，或者从西向东流通，流通的方向尽管变化无定，但支配商品经济运动的规律，却依然起着作用，并不发生什么变化。
    发现掌握经济运动规律的重要性
    社会经济规律自然地存在于社会经济现象中，当人们还没有认识到它的时候，就好象它是外在地存在着并与人们对立着似的，人们就要盲目地被动地受它的支配。如果人们的经济活动能适应经济规律的时候，经济活动就能够顺利的进行。反之，如果人们的经济活动不能适应这种规律，甚至于违反这种规律时，经济活动就要遭受阻碍，碰壁，吃亏。中国旧小说中曾讲过一个人做买卖的故事，说他贩猪羊快，贩羊猪快，但当他猪羊齐贩的时候，却又碰到断宰了。这就是很好的例子。
    固然我们说能适合经济规律是好的，但是要具体掌握经济规律就不容易了。例如一九四八年秋季石家庄金融紧缩，大小生产者都感到买卖困难，听说邢台纱贵，都挤到那里去贩纱，结果去的货多，销路不大，价格又低落了，很多人都碰钉子折了回来。这就是说这些生产者虽然懂得些“生意经”，并摸到了一点价格规律的眉目，但还是没有完全了解了价格的规律，所以他们的活动依然是盲目的。因此当我们对经济运动的规律还没有认识的时候，我们只能够对它盲目地服从，但当我们认识了它以后，却除了能够服从它以外，还能够自觉地利用它，控制它，掌握它，支配它。也只有当我们能利用、控制，掌握了支配经济运动的规律的时候，也才能使这些规律为我们服务，对我们的经济活动与经济发展才有好处。比如：在新民主主义经济下那个地区物价高涨，如果不运货物去调剂，而用限价的办法来限制，那是不会真正抑制物价高涨的。那里想要平稳物价，就必须使商品向那里流通。当然这是平稳物价的一方面，另外可能还有其他许多的办法，例如打击商人操纵居奇的行为，以及各地区与各部门间经济工作必须步调一致（各地区各部门间经济工作步调一致，对于平稳物价也是很重要的，这样才能使平稳物价有力量，不致因为力量分散，步调不一致而削弱力量）等等。总之，平稳物价需要有意识的、有计划的、统一的、协同一致的来掌握物价的规律才行。至于单纯的限价政策，并不注意增加物资供给来调整供求关系，都是违反物价规律的。今后我们国营贸易公司通过供销合作社来平稳物价，用大力来供给商品，可以克服自发的市场规律（法则）的盲目性，但我们掌握物价，掌握市场所起作用的大小，还要决定于我们经济力量的大小，经济组织的分布情况，与掌握经济规律的程度。
