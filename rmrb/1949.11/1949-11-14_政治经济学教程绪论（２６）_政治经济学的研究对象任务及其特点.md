    Political Economy Tutorial Introduction (26)
    The Object, Task, and Characteristics of Political Economy Research
    Chapter Two: Economic Movement and Economic Laws (Principles)
    Section Three: Economic Movement and Laws (Principles) of Economic Movement
    On the importance of mastering economic laws. For example, assuming the supply of our institution, with the food allowance remaining the same, the standard supply per person per day is specified as a certain amount of millet. Although this standard may not be completely suitable for the actual consumption of each person, it is only an average. However, this average is derived from the majority of people, not from a minority. Furthermore, it is not the result of a small amount of observation in the short term, but a standard derived from long-term, large-scale observation. Therefore, if each institution can implement it according to this standard, the institution's production can be compared to a production standard, and the supply can be used as the supply standard for each institution. Financially, it can also be used as a standard for revenue and expenditure budgets. For example, based on years of experience in the production of bedding, each set of clothing requires an average of thirty-seven square feet of fabric. The bedding production department can carry out production according to this standard and check for wasteful phenomena. Departments that need bedding can determine the size of materials according to this standard. The finance department can formulate bedding supply standards and determine bedding budgets according to this standard. In addition, the fabric production department can formulate fabric production plans according to this standard, and the commercial and trade departments can formulate their supply and marketing plans according to this standard. Because this is the common experience gained in actual work by several liberated areas' bedding supply departments over many years, it can be used as a general standard for bedding manufacturing, bedding supply, fabric, yarn, and cotton production and sales departments, as well as for bedding demanding institutions in manufacturing, supply, finance, production, sales, and demand. If this standard is accurately defined, it can approach economic laws, and even become economic laws. If our economic workers can understand economic laws, they can master them, control them, utilize them, and direct them. If we do not understand economic laws, we will be subject to their control and restriction. However, the laws themselves will still exist and function, and we will be blindly and passively dominated by them.
    
    Economic Workers Must Discover and Master Economic Laws to Make Them Serve the People
    Discovering the laws of economic movement as a working principle for our economic workers is absolutely necessary. After we discover the laws of economic movement, we must consciously abide by these laws, obey these laws, and master these laws to make them serve our economic work, promote the advancement and development of our economic work. However, to discover the laws of economic movement, we must obtain them from the observation of a large number of long-term economic phenomena, rather than from short-term observations of a small number of individual or accidental phenomena. When our work has just begun, lacking experience and not yet discovering the laws, our work will encounter some obstacles, and even encounter canceling factors. This is a phenomenon that is inevitable for a time. But when our work is in-depth, and we can conduct thorough and detailed investigations and research, coupled with long-term and large-scale observations, and are good at summarizing experience, we will have the ability to discover laws, master laws, control and apply laws, which will be of great benefit to our current and future work. This is not only true for economic work, but also for any other work. Therefore, Comrade Chen Boda told each of our economic workers: "The important thing is to be good at learning." This means that we must be good at investigation and research, good at analyzing various economic situations, grasping principles, discovering the laws of various economic movements, and controlling, utilizing, and directing these laws, so that these laws serve the people's economic construction movement. Therefore, it is also to serve the people.

    政治经济学教程绪论（２６）
    政治经济学的研究对象任务及其特点
    第二章  经济运动与经济规律（法则）
    第三节  经济运动与经济运动规律（法则）
    关于掌握经济规律的重要性。又如：假定我们机关的供给，在菜金不变的情况下，每人每天的供给标准规定是一斤几两小米，这个标准虽不能完全适合每一个人的实际消费量，只是一个平均数，但是这个平均数，乃是从多数人得来的平均数，不是从少数人得来的平均数，并且它也不是短期内小量观察的结果，而是长期大量观察得出来的标准。因此，如果各机关能按照这标准来实行的话，机关生产可比作为生产的一个标准，供给上就可以作为各机关的供给标准，财政上也可以依据它作为收支预算的一个标准。再如：根据长年间多数被服生产的经验，每套衣服平均需要三十七方尺的布料。被服生产部门可以根据这个标准来进行生产，并检查有无浪费的现象；需要被服的部门，可以根据这个标准来确定材料的尺度；财政部门可以根据这个标准来规定被服供给标准，确定被服的预决算。此外布匹生产部门可以根据这个标准来制定布匹生产计划，商业贸易部门可根据这个标准来制定它的供销计划。因为这是一个长年间几个解放区被服供给部门，在实际工作中所获得的共同经验，所以它可以被作为被服制造、被服供给、布匹、棉纱、棉花的生产、供销部门与被服需给机关制造上、供给上、财政上、生产上、供销上、与需要上的一般的标准。这种标准如果规定的准确，就能够接近经济规律，以至于就是经济规律。我们经济工作者如果能够认识经济规律，就可以掌握它、控制它、利用它、支配它。如果不认识经济规律，那未，我们反要受到它的支配限制。而规律本身却依然要在那里存在并发生作用，我们却要盲目地、被动地被它的支配。
    经济工作者必须发现掌握经济规律使它为人民服务
    发现经济运动的规律，作为我们经济工作者的工作原则，乃是完全必要的。当我们发现了经济运动的规律以后，我们就要有意识地遵守这个规律，服从这个规律，并掌握这个规律，使它为我们的经济工作服务，来推动我们经济工作的前进与发展。但我们要发现经济运动的规律，必须从大量的长期的经济现象的观察中才能获得，而不是短期的从少数个别的或偶然的现象中去观察所能成功的。当我们工作才开始，缺乏经验，还没有发现规律以前，我们的工作会遭受到某些障碍，甚至会遇到对消的因素，这也是一时势所难免的现象。但当我们工作深入，并能缜密周详的调查研究，加以长期的大量的观察，善于总结经验我们就有能力发现规律、掌握规律、支配并运用规律，对于我们目前与将来的工作，都有很大的好处。这不仅对于经济工作是这样，对于其他任何工作也莫不如此。所以陈伯达同志告诉我们每一个经济工作者：“重要的问题在善于学习。”就是要我们善于调查研究，善于分析各种经济情况掌握原则，发现各种经济运动的规律，并控制、利用、支配这些规律，使这些规律为人民的经济建设运动服务。从而也就是为人民服务。
