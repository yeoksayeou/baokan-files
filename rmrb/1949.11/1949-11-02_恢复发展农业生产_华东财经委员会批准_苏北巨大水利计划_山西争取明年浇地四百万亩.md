　　East China Financial and Economic Committee Approves
　　Huge Water Conservancy Plan for Northern Jiangsu
　　Shanxi Strives to Irrigate Four Million Mu Next Year
　　[Jiangsu News] In order to restore and develop agricultural production, the East China Financial and Economic Committee has approved the water conservancy plan for Northern Jiangsu. The main projects are: guiding the Yi River, managing the Shu River, controlling water and reclaiming land, and repairing the dikes of the Yangtze River and the Grand Canal, which will be completed in stages. This winter and next spring, the focus will be on guiding the Yi River. Water control and land reclamation along the coast, and the repair of the Yangtze River dikes and canal dikes will also be carried out separately. This is the central key to restoring and developing production in Northern Jiangsu and one of the most fundamental solutions to land reclamation. The project is huge, requiring approximately 200 million jin of grain and 600,000 laborers for the first phase, with an estimated 80 working days. It has already undergone on-site surveys, repeated studies, and discussions with cadres and experienced farmers in the river areas. It has been reviewed multiple times by the Administrative Office and approved by the East China Financial and Economic Committee, and will soon be announced. Most of Northern Jiangsu is a plain area. The rivers of Southern Shandong, Northern Anhui, and Southeastern Henan mostly flow through Northern Jiangsu into the sea. The rivers all belong to the Huai River system. In the downstream water system of the Huai River basin, the Yi, Si, and Shu Rivers are the main channels. In ancient times, the Huai River system had its own regular courses, and although time passed, there were no major changes. However, after the Yellow River seized the Huai River system, the water system became chaotic. Although the Yellow River moved north long ago, the old course of the Huai River silted up, and the various river channels could not be restored. The Huai River then changed its course, entering the Yangtze River through the Gaoyou, Baoying, and Shaobo Rivers, often causing harm to the area south of the Huai River and sometimes affecting the area north of the Huai River. The Yi, Si, and Shu Rivers, on the other hand, find their own outlets in Northern Jiangsu, mutually encroaching and causing harm, sometimes even threatening the Grand Canal and even aiding the Huai River in causing harm. The Yi, Si, and Shu Rivers all originate in the Yimeng Mountains of Shandong, with high sources and rapid currents, coming in with great force. Without sufficient flood discharge channels, Northern Jiangsu is more prone to disasters. Before the Anti-Japanese War, the Kuomintang reactionary government did not manage the water, nor did it provide disaster relief. During the Anti-Japanese War, the Japanese invaders and Wang puppet regime breached dikes and dams, and dug up river channels to exacerbate the water damage. During the Liberation War, the Chiang bandits blocked the Yangtze River dams during the summer flood season of 1946, causing the floods to breach the dikes and destroying all the autumn crops. This spring, Northern Jiangsu was completely liberated. Due to the river channels being neglected for more than ten years, there was no time to manage them. The focus was on rescuing the dikes and preventing floods. Since the beginning of summer, there has been continuous rain, and successive wind, rain, and tidal disasters. The Yi River poured in, and the central section of the Grand Canal breached, causing a major disaster. More than 17 million mu of farmland in Northern Jiangsu were flooded. Although rescued, 6 to 7 million mu were still lost, resulting in a loss of more than 1 billion jin of grain, 619 deaths and injuries, and a million houses collapsed. Water disasters are currently the main enemy of the people of Northern Jiangsu in production, construction, and people's lives. The losses caused by water disasters over the years are inestimable. Among them, the Huai River channel is in disrepair, and the flow is narrow, causing breaches every year, harming seven counties including Shuyang, Xin'an, Guanyun, Siyang, Suqian, and Pi-Sui. If it can be managed well, it can increase grain production by 500 million jin every year. In the coastal areas, the tides invade, the soil is alkaline and inferior, and the land cannot be planted. If rivers can be opened and dikes can be built, millions of mu of cotton fields can be added. To this end, the Northern Jiangsu Administrative Office has proposed water conservancy as the central task for this winter and next spring, and it is necessary to mobilize all efforts to complete the first year's water plan in order to reduce and eliminate the water disasters that occur every summer and autumn.
　　The surveying work has been basically completed, and surveys are being conducted in the construction areas this winter and next spring. The Huaiyin District is mobilizing the masses to plant wheat in the low-lying areas where they can be planted, transporting grain to the construction sites, and opening training classes to teach basic technical knowledge and train 1,000 cadres as assistants in the engineering offices. They are also investigating and repairing river repair tools such as carts, mud baskets, and iron shovels, and will conduct a comprehensive general mobilization at the end of this month to organize 300,000 workers to participate in the construction of the new Yi River.
　　The general policy of guiding the Yi and managing the Shu is to first do the Yi River project, and then manage the Shu River after the project of opening the new Shu River in Shandong is completed. In terms of engineering technology, the principles are: first, separate the Yi and Shu Rivers for management; second, build dikes and floodplains for flood discharge, with dike construction as the main focus.
　　The general policy of water control and land reclamation is to build sea dikes to defend against tides and ensure the safety of land reclamation, and to repair river channels, sluice gates, and culverts, with guiding the river into the sea as the main focus, while also discharging floods, storing fresh water, and facilitating planting in agricultural and cotton-growing areas.
　　[Taiyuan News] In order to strive for the completion of the water conservancy construction plan for irrigating 4 million mu of land in Shanxi Province this winter and next year, it is being actively carried out under the unified leadership of the Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau. According to statistics, a total of 3.57 million mu of land were irrigated in the province last winter and this spring and summer (2.4 million mu in Jinzhong, 720,000 mu in Jinnan, 400,000 mu in Jinxi, and 50,000 mu in Jindong). At present, in the Jinzhong area alone, the water conservancy projects being carried out according to plan will increase irrigation by more than 310,000 mu compared to last year. The preparation for this water conservancy plan began in the summer, and two Fen River Water Conservancy Committee meetings and water conservancy meetings of Yuci, Fenyang, and Xinzhou Special Zones and various counties were held. With the help of the surveying teams and investigation groups sent by the Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau, a plan was drawn up and work was immediately started. At present, the preparation of materials and equipment in various places is generally in place. The Fen River officially started construction on October 6th, with more than 400 people working on the dam every day. In order to ensure the Fen River's upper stream diversion project, which will irrigate 800,000 mu, will also start construction separately. The mud canals in Yangqu County and the suburbs of Taiyuan City should be irrigated as much as possible in advance, and repeatedly irrigated during the autumn harvest, in coordination with the Fen River damming, and will be closed before Minor Snow (solar term). The Tianyi Canal wet dam in the upper reaches of the Xiao River was closed for irrigation from October 6th to 21st, and the river dam and 60-li-long canal body of the Fuxing Canal will also be completed in mid-October. The Qing River will be closed for irrigation at the end of October. After the Fen River's water volume is dispersed, the Qingyuan Fen River Guanghui wet dam will then be closed. Then, the following five dry dams will start construction. At the same time, the Yuci Tianyi Canal (irrigating 30,000 mu), which is being repaired with government loans, and the Xin (Zhou) Ding (Xiang) Canal (irrigating 120,000 mu), newly built under government monopoly, will also start construction. In order to ensure the smooth progress of the work, the Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau sent three survey teams to Yuci, Fenyang, and Xinzhou Special Zones at the end of September and the beginning of October to assist in the work and provide technical guidance. It also formed a special working group to go to the Fen River and Xiao River for on-site guidance. In addition, in order to meet the needs of the masses in various places, the Water Conservancy Bureau will greatly promote the drilling of free-flowing wells and new-style waterwheels. The Water Conservancy Bureau plans to complete the drilling of 55 more free-flowing wells in Jiexiu County in the autumn and winter. By next year, together with the 21 wells drilled since this spring and the original 88 wells, more than 8,200 mu of alkaline wasteland in the county has been or will be turned into paddy fields. Other counties will also try to drill one to four wells before the end of the year, so that more than 100,000 mu of wasteland in the ten counties of Jinzhong will gradually be turned into paddy fields. The Water Conservancy Bureau has now promoted more than a dozen new-style waterwheels, which are light and durable and are very popular among the masses. It is striving to promote 5,000 waterwheels this winter and next year. For the 5,000 new-style waterwheels and 20 manual well-drilling machines that have been ordered, due to the low purchasing power of the masses, methods such as loans, joint ventures, and exclusive operations will be adopted.

  　华东财经委员会批准
  　苏北巨大水利计划
    山西争取明年浇地四百万亩
    【江苏讯】为恢复与发展农业生产，华东财经委员会批准苏北兴修水利计划。其主要工程为：导治沂水，整理沭水，治水兴垦，修补江堤及运河堤，将分期完成。今冬明春以导沂水为主，海边治水兴垦，修补江堤及运堤工程亦将分别进行。这是苏北恢复与发展生产的中心关键和解决兴垦最根本办法之一。该计划工程浩大，第一期约需粮两亿斤，河工六十万人，需做工时约八十天。现已经过实地勘测，反复研究与沿河地区的干部和有经验农民的讨论，和行政公署多次的审议，业经华东财经委员会批准，并即将公布。苏北大部是平原地区，鲁南、皖北、豫东南的河流，绝大部分皆流经苏北入海，河流统属淮河水系，在淮河流域的下游水系中，以沂、泗、沭为主要河道，古代淮系水道各有正轨，历时虽久，无大变化，自黄河夺淮系水道后，水系紊乱，黄河虽早已北迁，而淮河故道淤塞，各河道无法复原，淮水乃改由高邮、宝应、邵伯诸河入江，经常为害淮南，有时波及淮北。沂水、泗水、沭水则在淮北另找出路，互相侵扰为害淮北，有时并威协淮运，甚至助淮为害，而沂、泗、沭水皆发源于山东沂蒙山区，源高流急，来势汹涌，无足够的排洪道路，故淮北更易成灾。抗日战争以前，国民党反动政府有水不治，成灾不救。抗日战争期间日寇汪伪破堤塞闸，掘坏河道助水为害。解放战争期间，蒋匪曾于一九四六年夏伏汛堵塞江坝，洪水出堤秋田尽毁。今春苏北全境解放，以十余年失修的河道，一时不及整治，乃以抢救堤堆防水为主。入夏以来阴雨连绵，迭遭风雨潮灾，沂水倾注，中运河决口，致成巨灾。苏北全境有一千七百万亩以上田禾被淹，虽经抢救，尚有六七百万亩失收，损失粮食有十亿斤之多，死伤六一九人，倒屋百万间，水患为当前苏北人民在生产建设与人民生活中最主要的敌人。历年所受水灾的损失无法估计。其中以淮水河道失修，流量狭窄，年年决口，为害普及沭阳、新安、灌云、泗阳、宿迁、邳睢等七县，如能治好，则每年可增收五亿斤粮，而沿海一带，海潮侵漫，土质碱劣，田地不能种植，如能开河筑堤，就能增加数百万亩棉田，为此，苏北行署提出兴修水利，为今冬明春的中心任务，需要动员全力完成第一年度的水力计划，以期缩小和解除历年每届夏秋即至的水患。
    现勘测工作已基本完成，今冬明春的施工地带又进行勘测，淮阴分区正在动员群众将洼地能下种的地方种麦，运送粮食到施工地点，开办训练班，讲授初步技术常识，培养一千干部作为工程处的助手，调查修理修河的工具如小车、泥筐、铁铣，并将于本月底即进行全面总动员，组织三十万民工参加修新沂河。
    导沂整沭的总方针是先做沂水工程，俟山东开新沭河的工程完毕，再行整沭。在工程技术上采取第一沂、沭分治，第二筑堤漫滩排洪，以筑堤为主的原则。
    治水兴垦的总方针是修海堤防御海潮确保兴垦安全，修复河道闸洞，以导河入海为主，并能排洪蓄淡，便于农产区与棉垦区的种植。
    【太原讯】为争取今冬至明年山西全省浇地四百万亩的水利建设工作计划的完成，在省水利局统一领导下，正积极进行。据统计：去冬和今年春夏全省共浇地三百五十七万亩（晋中二百四十万亩，晋南七十二万亩，晋西北四十万亩，晋东南五万亩），现仅晋中地区，正在按照计划进行的水利工程，即较去年增浇三十一万余亩。这一水利计划的准备工作开始于夏季，曾召开了两次汾河水利委员会及榆次、汾阳、忻州专区和各县水利会议，在省水利局所派出的测量队、考查团帮助下，拟出计划，并即着手进行工作，目前各地物资、器材准备大体就绪。汾河已于十月六日正式动工，每日上堰做工者有四百余人。为保证汾河合拢浇地八十万亩的上流分水工程，也将分别动工。阳曲县及太原市郊的泥渠，尽量提前多浇地，在秋收中屡收屡浇，配合汾河堵口，定于小雪前闭口。萧河上游天一渠湿堰在十月六日至二十一日即合拢浇地，复兴渠之拦河水堰及长达六十华里之渠身亦将于十月中旬动工完成。清水河十月底合拢浇地。汾河水量被分散后，清源汾河广惠湿堰即接着合拢。接着以下五道干堰再动工。与此同时，政府贷款复修之榆次天一渠（可浇地三万亩）及政府专营新修的忻（州）定（襄）渠（可浇地十二万亩）亦将动工。为保证工作之顺利进展，省水利局于九月底至十月上旬，已派出三个测量队分赴榆次、汾阳、忻州专区协助工作，进行技术指导，又组成专门工作组赴汾河、萧河就地指导。此外，水利局为满足各地群众要求，将大量推广凿自流井和新式水车。水利局于秋冬两季在介休县完成再凿自流井五十五眼的计划，至明年，连同今春至今已凿的二十一眼及原有的八十八眼，该县八千二百余亩碱荒地已变成或将变成水稻田。其他各县也将在年前试凿一眼至四眼，俾使晋中十县的十余万亩的荒碱地逐渐变成稻田。水利局现已推广新式水车十余部，由于轻便、耐用颇为群众欢迎，争取在今冬至明年内推广五千部。对于订制的五千部新式水车和二十部人力凿井机，因群众购买力低弱，将采用贷、合营、专营等方式进行。
