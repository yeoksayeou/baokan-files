　　Strict Blockade Effective
　　Chahar North Plague Situation Remains Mostly Unchanged
　　Loopholes Still Being Investigated
    Here's another example: the woman from Ji Family House, Fourth District of Zhang City, who died of pneumonic plague on October 29th, was infected by her husband, who in turn contracted the plague in Chahar North. As a result, the couple died within five days of each other. Currently, the plague prevention leadership in Chahar Province and Chahar North has highly recognized the importance of "strict and merciless blockade." The fifth meeting of the Provincial Plague Prevention Committee decided that the garrison and security forces would be fully responsible for strict implementation. On October 28th, the Chahar North Prefectural Committee once again issued a plague prevention call: pointing out that the work of eradicating the plague is the overriding central task at present, the entire Party and army must, with a high spirit of serving the people, educate the masses to learn plague prevention knowledge, clearly define rewards and punishments, and overcome panic and complacency. Strict blockade, in addition to fixed posts, must also strengthen mobile posts; in isolated areas, implement village-by-village blockade, and immediately strictly blockade and isolate any patients, households, or villages with the disease, and resolutely cremate the corpses. The plague situation in Chahar North has not changed much in the last ten days, which is the result of multi-faceted isolation and blockade. However, the blockade in some areas is still not thorough enough. For example, a large cart from Inner Mongolia loaded with fur penetrated nearly a hundred miles into the isolated zone of Chahar North before being discovered, and responsibility is currently being investigated. In order to strengthen this work, Liu Zuoheng, Deputy Secretary of the Chahar North Plague Prevention Headquarters, and Feng Yunpan, Deputy Chief of Staff of the sub-district, have decided to personally go out to inspect and supervise.

### 封锁成效显著　察北疫情近无变化　仍有漏洞正追究

　　封锁成效显著
  　察北疫情近无变化
  　仍有漏洞正追究
    还有个实例，即张市四区吉家房子十月二十九患鼠疫死的那个妇女，是她丈夫传染的，她丈夫则是在察北染上鼠疫的，结果五日内夫妇相继病死。目前察省、察北防疫领导上，已高度认识到“严格无情封锁”的重要性。省防疫委员会第五次会议决定由驻军、保安队全权负责，严格执行。察北地委十月二十八日再次发出防疫号召：指出灭疫工作是当前压倒一切的中心工作，全党全军要以高度为人民服务的精神，教育群众学习防疫知识，严明奖惩，克服惊慌失措与麻痹大意的态度。严格封锁，除固定岗哨外，还须加强游动岗哨；绝缘地带，实行村村封锁，发现病人、病户、病村，马上严格封锁隔离，死尸要坚决焚烧。察北疫情近十天来无大变化，这是多面隔离封锁的结果。但某些地区封锁上仍不够周密，如内蒙一满载皮毛之大车一辆，深入到察北近百里的绝缘地带后，才被查获，现正追究责任。察北防疫总指挥部为加强这一工作，地委副书记刘作恒、分区冯云潘副参谋长等决亲自出巡督导。
