　　White Bone Pagoda
    Luo Deng
    May 18th was originally a clear day, but by the afternoon, the sky turned gloomy and it started to drizzle. In less than half an hour, everyone's clothes were soaked and stuck to their skin, making them shiver, and the ground became too slippery to walk on. So, after discussing it, we decided to stay in a village by the roadside.

    This village was called Wangjiafen, and it was under the jurisdiction of Huang'an County, Hubei Province. Our landlord was named Wang Jifu, over sixty years old, with a white beard. He was very kind to us. As soon as we entered the house, he immediately started a fire to dry our clothes and brewed ginger soup for us.

    It rained all night, only stopping a bit by the time we had breakfast the next day. The mud on the road was so sticky that we couldn't get our feet out of it, so after eating, we didn't even pack our luggage, waiting for the road to dry a little in the afternoon before leaving. At this time, the landlord, Old Man Wang, came over and asked, "Comrades won't be able to leave today, will you?"

    We said, "It's impossible in the morning, we'll see in the afternoon, maybe we can leave!"

    Old Man Wang continued, "If you're not leaving, I'll take you to see an historical site! The teams that passed through here last month all saw it."

    Everyone asked together, "What historical site?"

    He said, "There's a White Bone Pagoda on the riverbank southwest of the village, about half a li away. This pagoda was built by the White Army from the bones of thousands upon thousands of people. Inside, there are bones of former Red Army comrades, as well as the bones of ordinary people. Comrades should definitely go and see it."

    Originally, some comrades didn't really want to go, but after Old Man Wang said this, they rolled up their trousers, took off their shoes and went barefoot. Old Man Wang led the way, explaining the origin of the White Bone Pagoda as we walked. He said:

    "Our Huang'an County had the Communist Party and the Red Army as early as the sixteenth year of the Republic of China (1927). At that time, the Red Army was very small, with only sixteen and a half guns, because one of the seventeen guns didn't have an extractor hook. After firing one shot, you had to manually remove the spent cartridge, so while others could fire ten bullets, it couldn't even fire five. By the twenty-first year of the Republic of China (1932), the Red Army here had expanded to two armies (the Twenty-Fourth and Twenty-Sixth Red Armies), plus an independent brigade. But it was also in this year that Chiang Kai-shek occupied Huang'an City. They said Huang'an was a 'bandit den', a 'red zone', and were determined to eliminate the Communist Party in the 'red zone', putting forward the slogan: 'Rather kill a thousand by mistake than let one escape'. At this time, the landlords and despots became popular again, acting as informants for the Kuomintang to arrest people. As long as someone had spoken to a Communist or had any family connection to a Communist, they were all arrested and killed."

    Old Man Wang sighed and continued, "At that time, once someone was arrested, everyone knew clearly that they weren't Communists, but no one dared to step forward to vouch for them. After they were killed, even their own relatives didn't dare to claim the bodies. Comrades, it was truly a situation where relatives dared not recognize each other! Just outside the west gate of our village, ten or twenty people were killed every day. From Mount Tiantan to the Southwest Bridge, the river beach for over three li was filled with corpses, one next to the other. It's no exaggeration to say that blood flowed like a river and bones piled up like mountains. At that time, just hearing someone calling loudly at the door would send shivers down your spine. At the sound of gunfire, packs of dogs from nearby villages would run to eat human flesh, their eyes red with hunger, making people afraid to walk during the day. Two or three people had to carry sticks when they went out."

    His words made everyone feel very sad, and no one wanted to interrupt him, just following along with their heads lowered. Suddenly, Old Man Wang pointed and said, "Take the Dawancun village over there as an example. The whole village originally had more than one hundred and seventy households, but Chiang Kai-shek killed all but seven people. The killing was most severe in the autumn of the twenty-first year of the Republic of China (1932), it was simply indiscriminate, regardless of men, women, old or young. A sister-in-law from the village ahead was arrested, and she was pregnant. Crying, she begged those executioners to give her a few more months, to wait until she had given birth to the child before killing her, but the Chiang bandit army glared at her and said, 'No! You and your child can go together!' They went up and thrust a bayonet into the sister-in-law's stomach, she screamed and fell down. Then they stabbed her five or six more times, saying fiercely, 'If we don't do it like this, we'll never be able to exterminate the Communist Party!' Comrades, think about it, if they had even a little humanity, could they have committed such heinous acts?"

    Actually, we had already arrived at the base of the pagoda, but because everyone was listening to Old Man Wang's words with such heartache, no one dared to wander off to take a closer look at the pagoda. Finally, he pointed and said, "This pagoda was built in the twenty-second year of the Republic of China (1933). That year, a Kuomintang county magistrate saw that the ground was covered with white bones, which was too unsightly. In order to cover up the people's eyes and ears, probably also to suppress the people forever, he sent some laborers from the county town, dug a pit about a zhang deep and two zhang wide, collected the bones and built this pagoda. Later, the people called it the White Bone Pagoda."

    At this point, Old Man Wang turned his face and said to everyone in an earnest tone, "Comrades, our people have suffered too much these past ten years or so. If you hadn't come back, who would know about these unjustly dead people? Who could avenge them? So, as long as your team passes through here, I tell them to come and see, to let them know about our blood feud with Chiang Kai-shek!"

    Since seeing the White Bone Pagoda, I have often thought about this, to tell this matter to every comrade, to let everyone know about our blood feud with Chiang Kai-shek and the reactionaries, and we must avenge those who died unjustly!

　　白骨塔
    罗登
    五月十八号，本来是个睛天，但是一到下午，天说阴就阴了，并且漓漓拉拉的下起来。不到半个时辰，大家的衣服都淋得贴到了肉上，全身直发冷，地下也滑得不能走，于是我们一商量，就在道旁一个村子住下了。
    这个村子名叫王家坟，属湖北黄安县管。我们的房东姓王，名叫王基富，六十多岁，白胡子，待我们很亲热，我们一进屋他就马上弄火，替我们烤干衣服，给我们熬姜水喝。
    雨一直下了一夜，到第二天吃早饭的时候才住点，路上的稀泥粘的没法下脚，所以我们吃过饭连行李也没有捆，等着下午道路稍微干一点再走。这时候房东王老汉走过来问道：“同志今天走不成了吧？”
    我们说：“上午是不成了，等下午看看也许能走！”
    王老汉又接着说：“不走，我领你们去看个古迹吧！上月打这里过的队伍，他们都看了。”
    大家就一齐问：“什么古迹？”
    他说：“在这西南离村半里多路的河岸上，有一座白骨塔，这座塔是从前白军用上千上万的人骨头修成的，里面也有从前红军同志的骨头，也有老百姓的骨头。同志一定得去看才好。”
    本来有几个同志不大想去，可是经过王老汉这样一说，也就挽起裤子光着脚板都去了。王老汉前边当向导，一面走，一面向大家介绍着白骨塔的来历。他说：
    “我们黄安县，从民国十六年就有了共产党，也有了红军，那时候红军队伍很小，只有十六条半枪，因为十七条枪里边，一条没抓子勾，打一枪就得通一次子弹壳，别人打十发子弹，它还打不了五发。到了民国二十一年，这里红军就扩大到了两个军（红二十四军和二十六军），还外加一个独立旅，可也就在这一年，蒋介石就占了黄安城，他们说黄安是‘匪窝’，是‘赤化区’，决心要剿清‘赤化区’的共产党，提出口号：‘宁愿错杀一千，不让逃走一个’。这时候地主恶霸又都吃香了，替国民党当抓人的引线，只要是和共产党说过话，和共产党有点沾亲带故的人，一律都给捉去杀掉了。”
    王老汉叹了一口气，接着说：“那时候，只要一被抓去，大家明明知道他不是共产党，可谁也不敢出头去保，杀过之后，就是自己的亲人也不敢去领尸。同志，那真是六亲不敢相认哪！单是我们这村子西门外，每天总杀上十个二十个，从天坛山到西南大桥，三里多路的河滩里，死尸摆的一个挨一个。说是血流成河，尸骨堆山，那是一点也不差。那时候，只要听到有人大声叫门，吓的头皮都发麻。一听见枪声，附近庄子的狗，成群结队的跑去吃人肉，狗眼都红了，弄得人白天不敢走路，两三个人出门还得带棒子。”
    他讲得大家心里很难过，谁也不愿意打断他的话，都只是低着头跟着走。忽然，王老汉用手指划说：“就拿那边的大湾村来说吧，全村原先有一百七十多户人家，被蒋介石杀的只剩七个人了。杀得最厉害的时候，是在民国二十一年秋天，那简直是不论男女老少了。前边那个村子有个大嫂子给抓去，她肚里还怀着孕，哭着向那些刽子手央求，再缓他几个月，等养下这个孩子再杀她，但是蒋匪军把眼一瞪说：‘不行！你们娘俩一道去吧！’上去一刺刀，刺进那大嫂的肚里，她惨叫了一声倒下了，接着又用刺刀连札了五六下，狠狠的说：‘非这样干，共产党就绝不了种！’同志们想想，他们要是有一点人性，能下得了这样的毒手吗？”
    其实，这时我们已经到了塔根前，不过因为大家都痛心的在听王老汉讲话，谁也不肯走散去仔细看那座塔。最后，他才指着说：“这座塔是民国二十二年修的，那年，国民党的一个县长，看到满地白骨太不好看，为了遮遮人的耳目，大概也是为了永远镇压老百姓，才从县城派了些民工，挖了一个丈把深两丈宽的大坑，把骨头收拾进去，修了这座塔。后来老百姓就叫它白骨塔。”
    说到这里，王老汉转过脸来带着嘱咐的口气向大家道：“同志啊，这十几年咱老百姓受的苦太多了，你们要是不回来，这些屈死的人有谁知道呢？有谁能替他们报仇呢？所以只要咱们队伍打这里过，我就向他们讲，叫他们来看，叫他们知道咱和蒋介石的血海深仇！”
    自从看过白骨塔以后，我也是常常这样想，要把这件事情告诉每个同志，叫大家知道咱们和蒋介石反动派的血海深仇，一定要替那些冤枉死的人们报仇雪恨！
