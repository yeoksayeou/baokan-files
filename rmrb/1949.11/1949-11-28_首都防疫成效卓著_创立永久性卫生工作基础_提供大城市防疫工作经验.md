　　Remarkable Achievements in Epidemic Prevention in the Capital
　　Establishing a Permanent Foundation for Health Work
　　Providing Experience for Epidemic Prevention in Large Cities
　　[Report from this newspaper] The epidemic prevention work in Beijing has come to an end. In this epidemic prevention work, thanks to the attention of the leadership, epidemic prevention organizations at all levels were quickly established, diverse, extensive, in-depth, and practical publicity was adopted. With the joint efforts of cadres, medical personnel, and citizens, the blockade, quarantine, and rat-catching campaigns were launched early, successfully preventing the danger of plague invading the capital, laying the foundation for permanent health work in the city, and providing preliminary experience for emergency epidemic prevention measures in major cities.
　　Since October 27, when a report on the epidemic situation in the Zhangjiakou area was received, the Beijing Municipal Government decided at the municipal administrative meeting on the 28th to establish a municipal epidemic prevention committee to lead the city's epidemic prevention work. On the 29th, a meeting of responsible cadres and experts from the city's Party, government, military, and civilian sectors was convened, and the epidemic prevention committee was formally established. Immediately afterwards, meetings of district heads and public security bureau chiefs from urban and suburban areas were convened to establish branch committees of the epidemic prevention committee at the district level and sub-branches and health teams below the district level. Following this, representatives of medical workers, cadres at all levels, and residents of streets and villages successively held meetings and quickly established epidemic prevention organizations below the district level. Factories, organizations, government offices, and schools also established epidemic prevention institutions.
　　After the establishment of the Municipal Epidemic Prevention Committee, it was decided that the initial central tasks were publicity and blockade, and efforts were made to launch rat-catching and sanitation campaigns as early as possible.
　　When the publicity work began, the publicity section of the Municipal Epidemic Prevention Committee and the publicity divisions of the district branches convened publicity meetings respectively, using various meetings to explain the importance of preventing plague and the methods of prevention and treatment, and inviting local doctors to give lectures. At the same time, newspapers and radio stations in the city broadcast a large amount of epidemic prevention materials. The Municipal Epidemic Prevention Committee printed and distributed publicity brochures, leaflets, and slogans, and organized seven cultural work troupes to conduct publicity in various districts in the form of short plays, peep shows, and musical performances, in coordination with doctors' explanations. Cinemas added epidemic prevention films and slides. Government offices, organizations, factories, schools, etc. in various districts also carried out publicity through rooftop broadcasting, home visits, and street publicity. Due to the diversity, breadth, and depth of the publicity, and the fact that the publicity content was timely coordinated with the epidemic prevention steps and in line with reality, the masses were basically mobilized. Before the formal launch of the rat-catching and sanitation campaign, some people had already begun to remove garbage and sprinkle lime, etc.; some people even voluntarily requested injections. The masses in Xibeiwang, a small mountain village more than six li away from Qinglongqiao, requested that people be sent to give injections. The masses were also particularly vigilant about people coming from the epidemic area and requested that people returning from near Zhangjiakou be sent to isolation centers. Many citizens wrote letters and articles to the Municipal Epidemic Prevention Committee and newspapers to introduce epidemic prevention knowledge or provide opinions on epidemic prevention measures.
　　The blockade and isolation work initially only established quarantine stations at several city gates and railway stations. By November 9, with the cooperation of the armed forces, two blockade lines were completed. One line was established along the edge of the eastern, western, and northern suburbs of the city for hundreds of li, with eight quarantine stations; the other line was the city wall of Beijing, with fourteen quarantine stations. In addition, blockade points and quarantine stations were established at important water and land traffic points. If suspected patients were found in the urban area, temporary blockade, quarantine, and isolation treatment were implemented. Each quarantine station was equipped with a small isolation center and disinfection personnel. Preparations were also made to establish an isolation hospital and two large isolation centers in the suburbs.
　　The rat-catching and sanitation campaign officially began on November 10. Two rat-catching and sanitation meetings were convened in advance in various districts to discuss the implementation plan and decide on the methods for collecting rats and testing and handling rats. The more than 30,000 tons of garbage accumulated in the city was removed by calling on districts to launch voluntary cooperative transport.
　　In addition, the Epidemic Prevention Section established ten epidemic prevention stations in the suburbs, maintained close contact with the district epidemic prevention branches, and carried out preventive injections, disinfection, isolation, publicity, and mobile quarantine work. Isolation hospitals and laboratories and fourteen mobile quarantine and injection teams were also established. Districts organized local doctors to carry out preventive injections and preliminary quarantine work. From October 30 to November 10, a total of 397,955 people were injected (the number of people injected by suburban epidemic prevention stations and local doctors in various districts is not included), and a total of 104,483 people were quarantined.
　　This epidemic prevention campaign was unprecedented in the city. Medical personnel participated in the work with extremely high enthusiasm. At least 900 people from public and private medical units participated in the epidemic prevention work, and 265 private hospitals and clinics in the city participated in the epidemic prevention work. Moreover, many expressed their willingness to go to the front. All the staff, regardless of day or night, were not afraid of running around and were too busy to eat or sleep well, but they had no complaints. A practicing physician said: "The government cares so much about the people, why shouldn't we serve the people?"
　　At present, the epidemic situation in Chahar Province has eased, but it has not yet been extinguished, and the epidemic prevention work in Beijing cannot be paralyzed and ignored. The plan of the Municipal Epidemic Prevention Committee is: 1. Complete the rat-catching and sanitation campaign. 2. Complete at least one million epidemic prevention injections and strive for two million injections. 3. Through this campaign, establish and consolidate permanent grassroots health organizations (such as health teams) and establish certain health work systems. 4. After the epidemic prevention work is completed, carefully summarize the experience of this epidemic prevention work.

　　首都防疫成效卓著
  　创立永久性卫生工作基础
    提供大城市防疫工作经验
    【本报讯】北京市防疫工作已告一段落。此次防疫工作中，由于领导上的重视，迅速建立了各级防疫组织，采取了多样性的广泛深入的切合实际的宣传，在干部、医务人员与市民的共同努力之下，及早展开了封锁、检疫和清洁捕鼠运动，胜利地阻止了鼠疫侵袭首都的危险，为本市永久性的卫生工作创立了基础，并给各大城市作紧急防疫措施提供了初步经验。
    京市自十月二十七日得到张家口一带的疫情报告后，在二十八日市政务会议上即决定建立本市防疫委员会，领导进行全市防疫工作。二十九日召集本市党、政、军、民负责干部及专家会议，正式成立防疫委员会，旋即召集城区和郊区区长、公安局长会议，决定建立各区防疫委员会分会及区以下的支分会和卫生小组。紧接着，各医务工作者代表、各级干部和各街、村居民，均先后分别开会，迅即成立区以下防疫组织，各工厂、团体、机关、学校也纷纷组织了防疫机构。
    市防疫委会成立之后，即决定初步中心工作为宣传与封锁，并争取及早展开捕鼠清洁运动。
    宣传工作开始时，市防疫委会宣传科与区分会的宣传股分别召开了宣传会议，利用各种会议讲解防止鼠疫的重要性和防治方法，并请当地医生去作讲解。同时市内各报纸、广播电台大量刊播防疫材料，市防疫委会印发宣传小册子、传单、标语，并组织了七个文工团，用短剧、拉洋片、音乐唱歌等形式到各区进行宣传，配合医师进行讲解。各电影院加映防疫片与幻灯等。各区机关团体工厂学校等也用屋顶广播、家庭拜访及街头宣传等方式进行宣传。由于宣传的多样性与广泛深入，宣传内容又及时地配合防疫步骤，切合实际，基本上把群众动员起来了，在未正式展开捕鼠清洁运动之前，有的群众已开始清除垃圾，撒石灰等；有的人并自动要求注射，距青龙桥六里多的小山村西北旺群众，要求派人去注射。对疫区来的群众也特别警惕了，要求把从张家口附近回来的人送隔离所。很多市民写信、写稿寄给市防疫委会和各报社介绍防疫知识或提供防疫措施的意见。
    封锁隔离工作，起初仅在几个城门和车站建立检疫站，至十一月九日在武装部队配合下完成了两道封锁线，一道沿市东西北郊边缘区百余里，建立八个检疫站；一道为本市城墙，建立十四个检疫站。另外在水陆要冲建立封锁点和检疫站。市区内如发现可疑患者，即临时实行封锁、检疫与隔离治疗。每一检疫站均设有小型隔离所，配置消毒人员。并准备在郊区建立隔离病院和两处大型隔离所。
    十一月十日起正式开始捕鼠清洁运动，事先召开了两次各区捕鼠清洁会议，研讨实施计划，并决定了收鼠和鼠的检验处理办法。本市积存的三万余吨垃圾，号召各区发起义务协运，彻底清除。
    此外防疫科在郊区建立了十个防疫站，与区防疫分会密切联系，进行预防注射、消毒、隔离、宣传及机动检疫工作。又设立了隔离病院和化验室及十四个机动的检疫、注射小组。各区并组织当地医生担任预防注射和初步检疫工作。由十月三十日至十一月十日，共注射了三十九万七千九百五十五人（郊区防疫站及各区当地医生注射人数尚未计入），受检疫的人数共十万零四百八十三人。
    这次防疫运动，在本市是空前的，医务人员以极高的热情来参加工作。各公私医务单位参加防疫工作的人员至少有九百人，城内二百六十五处私人医院和诊疗所参加了防疫工作。而且多表示愿意到前方去。全体工作人员，不论昼夜，不怕跑路，忙的吃不上，睡不好，但都毫无怨言。一位开业医师说：“政府对人民这样关心，我们为什么不为人民服务呢？”
    目前，察省疫情已告和缓，但仍未扑灭，京市防疫工作仍不能麻痹忽视。市防疫委会的计划是：一、完成捕鼠清洁运动。二、最少完成一百万人的防疫注射，争取注射二百万人。三、通过这次运动，建立并巩固永久性的基层卫生组织（如卫生小组），并树立一定的卫生工作制度。四、防疫工作结束后，好好总结此次防疫工作的经验。
