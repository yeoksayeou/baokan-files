　　A Stroll Through Kailuan
    Lin Li
    In the past few days, I've toured the renowned "Kailuan Kingdom"; from its tall buildings and magnificent mansions to its affiliated hospitals and mine police stations. I've discovered that every corner of it is moving under the banner of opposing unreasonable systems and aligning with the working class. The relationships between people and between people and things are also changing, and are in the process of changing, along with the development of the movement.
    Stepping onto the wide and elegant Xishan Road, and heading west for over a hundred meters, one arrives at the Kailuan Senior Staff Club. This place used to be called the "Foreigners' Lounge," where Chinese people were strictly forbidden from even peeking inside. Later, the restrictions were loosened, allowing only certain senior staff members and their wives and daughters to come and dance and swim. But now, it has become the best place for workers to hold meetings and discussions. When I entered, two meetings were taking place simultaneously. In the open-air cinema square, hundreds of underground miners were enthusiastically discussing their work after the abolition of the contractor system. Entering the beautiful ballroom, over a hundred mine police officers, together with worker representatives, were conducting a denunciation of traitors from the period of Japanese and puppet rule, Kuomintang spies, and reactionary elements who had once frantically suppressed the workers' movement. The mine police station possessed a special armed force of over fourteen hundred people. It has always been free from the restraints and restrictions of the local government, maintaining its own judicial, administrative, criminal, and investigation agencies. It could arbitrarily arrest, detain, and interrogate workers without any legal procedures. In every strike movement, it was the executioner who directly slaughtered the workers. Therefore, whenever the mine police station was mentioned, the workers would scold it with angry glares.
    These two groups, irreconcilable in the past, are gathered together today. The workers make accusations, and the police officers immediately stand up to testify for them. Their united gaze gradually focuses on certain officials at the upper level—those unforgivable murderers. Those with conclusive evidence of being traitors or spies are reported to the court; the next most heinous villains are expelled from the mine. The majority of the police officers, who have no particularly evil deeds and who have also suffered from the oppression of traitors and spies, immediately stand on the side of the working class, shouting "Align with the working class! Be a people's police officer!" and earnestly express their desire to wash away all past bad habits with practical actions, to transform themselves, and to start anew. Then, the worker representatives stand up together with the police officer representatives, shouting in unison: "Workers and police officers unite, expel traitors and spies, and defend our mine!" This anti-people organization has thus become the property of the people.
    Whenever I walk to the entrance of the Kailuan Hospital, the encounter of miner Yang Junsheng naturally comes to mind. Before the liberation of Tangshan, Yang Junsheng broke his leg on the job. He dragged himself, moaning in pain, to the hospital, just as the people in the hospital were taking a break. The cold words "Not during office hours" stopped him on the street. As things would have it, a foreign staff member arrived in a car carrying an injured dog, and was immediately given a warm welcome by the hospital. Taking advantage of the dog's treatment, Yang, after earnestly begging, finally got the chance to see a doctor. This cruel attitude of treating Chinese people as inferior to foreign dogs was by no means limited to the case of Yang Junsheng.
    Coming to Kailuan Hospital again this time, I see that the doctors, nurses, and workers here are automatically raising the weapons of criticism and self-criticism, and beginning to settle accounts for their incorrect attitudes towards workers. Doctor Li Baokui, in reviewing the shortcomings of the medical staff, said: "In the past, our hospital did not treat illnesses, but rather treated people. When people with money, power, and high positions came, we were respectful and attentive; towards workers, especially towards the families of poorer workers, we were impatient, disgusted, and quick to lose our temper." As a result, the workers did not see the hospital staff as their own people, but said they were on the same side as the capitalists. Now they realize that this is because in the past they did not understand that the Kailuan working class is the true master of Kailuan. Therefore, they did not have the perspective of serving the workers. But people believe that there is an even more important reason: the dark rule of the Kailuan authorities in the past has undermined the compassion, pity, kindness, and humanitarianism that people generally possess. Doctor Zhu Xianyi is one such example. Once, Doctor Zhu advocated giving a seriously injured worker the medicine he should have been given, but because the medicine was expensive, he could not get approval several times. Doctor Zhu could not bear to watch someone who could have lived die, so he personally went to the chief doctor to argue. However, the chief doctor jokingly asked him: "Who are you treating?" Zhu replied resolutely: "I am treating the disease, not the person!" The chief doctor then said in a disdainful tone: "That's a worker; good medicine cannot be given to them." Doctor Zhu could not listen anymore and resigned to express his protest. "Looking at the person, not the illness," was originally one of the "habits" of Kailuan Hospital. Tangshan Hospital Director Du Wanheng repeatedly stated that Kailuan has adhered to the old system for decades. Unreasonable systems that violate the interests of the vast majority of workers permeate every corner, cultivating people's bad habits of looking up to the sky and not looking down. He proposed establishing a hospital affairs committee to conduct extensive criticism and inspection in order to improve work in a timely manner and better serve the workers. Nurse Liu Yubin immediately stood up to express her support. She suggested taking swift action, saying: "All departments in Kailuan are improving work efficiency under the slogan of opposing unreasonable systems and serving the workers. Our hospital still does not work eight hours a day. If we are determined to serve the workers, I propose that we take action immediately: voluntarily work overtime to make up eight hours..." Her words immediately received everyone's support. After review and criticism, everyone seemed to have found a glorious path—medical staff returning to the ranks of the working class and better serving the working class.
    Before liberation, the Kailuan office building, which has four hundred and ninety-four employees, was the best microcosm of a feudal hierarchical society. It not only never associated with "coal miners," but also had an insurmountable gap between staff members of different levels. It is said that there were four toilets in the building, three of which were reserved for the less than one-fifth of senior and upper-middle-level staff members. The more than three hundred middle-level staff members, despite often being "fully occupied" in one toilet, were never allowed to go to the place with the "Private Toilet" sign. Junior staff members had no indoor toilets at all and had to go out of the Western-style building to the outdoor "latrine." Union committee member Zheng Shirong told me: "All these inequalities are a thing of the past, and they will never be revived!" Staff members are now enveloped in a new atmosphere of unity. Zheng Shirong pointed to an old gentleman next to him and said: "Mr. Yun is a senior staff member, and now he is working with us in the union!" Yun Ji is fifty-eight years old this year. He wears a pair of glasses and is painstakingly holding a pencil, copying the resumes of union members. He has been elected as an alternate committee member. On the sheet introducing his characteristics, it is written that he is: "An old activist." I once asked him: "If you were asked to join the union in the past, would you have felt insulted?" Mr. Yun laughed: "Now, no one thinks that way!" Study committee member Zhang Shiyong said that the staff members' thinking has changed greatly recently. When the contractor system was abolished, the union wanted to organize a propaganda team and wanted to recruit some staff members to participate. He was asked to mobilize them. He had no confidence and felt that it would be difficult to mobilize these people, but "when I announced that I would volunteer to participate, the original plan was to have enough with thirty people, but more than fifty came." He said that after the staff members went through the study movement, they no longer thought that "coal miners" were inferior, and were willing to lean closely to the side of the workers. Yes, after the staff members returned to the ranks of the working class, they also fought against various unreasonable systems in the leading position of the masters of the country. Official documents have begun to be written in Chinese. What is related to the staff members' own interests is the "Get rid of the snuff bottles" movement that has been brewing recently - things started like this: Kailuan originally had an annual salary increase and promotion system based on "merit". In recent years it was terminated due to various difficulties. After liberation, the difficulties were still very serious, and the difficulties increased even more due to the blockade of the U.S. imperialists helping Chiang Kai-shek. Under these circumstances, the staff members consciously rose up to overcome the difficulties and worked without complaint. But in July and August, the Mining Bureau suddenly issued an order to restore the salary increase and promotion system, promoting some people and also giving some people salary increases. As a result, public opinion was in an uproar and the people were angry. Some said that the difficulties have not yet passed, and the mine is not actively trying to overcome the difficulties, but is hurriedly upgrading and increasing the salaries of a few people, which will aggravate the current difficulties. Some said that the disparity in wages between Kailuan employees is unmatched by major companies across the country, which is inherently unreasonable, and workers have long opposed it. Still others said that promotions have always been based on the mine's preferences. Whoever gives more gifts and knows how to flatter will be promoted. In today's era of the people, this style must be opposed. As a result, even those who had their salaries increased were swept into the wave of opposition. I once asked Zhang Hongyi, who had his salary increased. He is an ordinary staff member whose base salary was originally 150 yuan per month, and is now increased to 171 yuan. Although it is twice as high as that of ordinary workers, it is less than one-tenth of that of senior staff members. It is less than one-hundredth of that of specially senior staff members. His reason for opposing it is: for long-term interests, I would rather sacrifice some temporary interests. He said: "Now we are already living far more comfortably than workers and farmers." He believes that the current issue is not about salary increases and promotions, but about those senior and specially senior people being lowered, which would be more reasonable. Getting rid of the "snuff bottles" started from here. The staff members unanimously believe that Kailuan currently has a large number of people who are taking high salaries and not doing anything. Some compare them to grandfather clocks or antiques that can only be admired and looked at. Some say that clocks can still tell the time, but these people are simply ash trays for catching cigarette ash and holding matchsticks. That was at a staff member study meeting. When this was said, people clapped hard, and they shouted in unison: Please don't be in a hurry to increase the salaries and promote a few people! First, get rid of these "snuff bottles" and work hard to overcome the current difficulties! (Note: Under the opposition of the staff members, the order to increase salaries and promotions has been withdrawn)
    In the eyes of the workers, the staff members have always been seen as spokesmen for the capitalists. Now they are standing closely together, in the leading position of the masters of the country, and are united to oppose unreasonable systems, to overcome difficulties, and to realize the task of restoring and developing production.

　　开滦漫步
    林里
    最近几天，我把这座驰名中外的“开滦王国”周游了一圈；从它那高大的建筑，富丽豪华的高楼，到它所附属的医院、矿警所。我发现：它的每一个角落，都在反对不合理制度，向工人阶级靠拢的大旗下运动着。人与人，人与物的关系，亦随着运动的发展变化了，和正在变化着。
    踏上宽阔而幽雅的西山马路，西行百多米，便是开滦高级员司俱乐部。这里，早先叫“洋客厅”，中国人一概不准窥视。后来放宽尺度，也只允许某些高级员司和他的太太小姐们，来跳舞、游泳。但现在，它变成了职工们开会议事的最好场所。当我进去的时候，这儿同时正开着两个会。在露天影院的广场上，数百名井下工友，热情的讨论着取消包工大柜以后的工作。步入那间美丽的跳舞厅，是百多名矿警，和工人代表一起——正进行检举日伪时代的汉奸，国民党时代的特务，以及曾经疯狂镇压过工人运动的反动分子。矿警所拥有一千四百多人的特殊武装。它向来不受当地政府的约束与限制，保有自己的司法、行政、刑事、侦察等机构。它可以不经任何法律手续任意逮捕、扣押和审讯工人们。在每次罢工运动中，它是直接屠杀工人的刽子手，因此，每逢提到矿警所，工人们便横眉冷眼的骂着。
    这末两个在过去水火不能相容的集团，今天聚集在一堂，工人们控诉，警士立即站起来为他作证。他们一致的目光，逐渐集中于上层的某些官长——那些罪不可恕的凶手身上。汉奸、特务证据确凿者被告到法院；次一号的恶棍被驱逐出矿场。大多数无甚恶迹，而且同样受着汉奸特务欺压的警士们，立刻站在了工人阶级一边，高呼“向工人阶级靠拢！做一个人民的警察。”并恳切表示：要以实际行动洗掉过去的一切恶习，改头换面，重新做人。于是工人代表站起来，和警士代表一起，齐声高呼：“工人、警士团结起来，驱逐汉奸特务，保卫我们的矿场！”这个反人民的机构，至此变为人民所有了。
    每逢走到开滦医院的门口，矿工杨俊升的遭遇，就很自然的涌上心头。那是唐山解放之前，杨俊升因公砸断了腿。他呻吟苦痛的拖到医院，正是医院里的人们休息的时候，“不到办公时间”的冷语，把他阻止于街头。事情就如此凑巧，某外籍员司坐着汽车抱来了受伤的狗，立刻受到院方亲切的招待，趁着医狗之便，杨又经过一番恳切的哀求，才获得就医的机会。这样把中国人看成不如外国狗的冷酷态度，其实又何止于杨俊升之一例呢？
    此次再到开滦医院，我看见，这里的大夫、护士与工友，自动举起批评与自我批评的武器，开始清算对工人不正确的态度了。李宝奎大夫在检讨到医务人员的缺点时说：“过去，我们的医院不是看病，而是看人。有钱有势职位高贵的人来了，就恭而敬之；对工人，尤其对比较贫苦的工人家属，就不耐烦，嫌脏，发脾气。”因而工人不把医院人员看成是自己人，而说他们是和资本家一气。现在他们检讨到，这是由于过去不懂得开滦工人阶级是开滦的真正主人。因此没有为工人服务的观点。但人们认为还有一个更重要的原因：是过去开滦当局的黑暗统治，使一般人所具有的恻隐怜悯，慈祥善良的人道观点也都受到了打击。朱宪彝大夫就是其中一例。有一次，朱大夫主张给某重伤工友用应该用的药，但因该药贵重，几次得不到批准，朱大夫不忍心看着能够活下去的人死掉，亲自去找总院长辩理，然而院长诙谐的问他：“你给什么人看病？”朱慨然答称：“我在治病，不是治人！”院长继以轻污的语句说：“那是工人，好药是不能给他们用的。”朱大夫再不能听下去，便以辞职表示了他的抗议。“看人不看病。”这原是开滦医院的“习惯”之一。唐山院杜万亨院长一再表示，开滦墨守了几十年的旧制度，不合理的、违反广大工人利益的制度贯串在每一个角落，养成了人们昂首望天，不看下层的恶习。他提议建立院务委员会，展开广泛的批评与检查，以便及时的改进工作，更好的为工人服务。女护士刘玉彬立时起立表示赞成，她建议迅速的行动起来，她说：“开滦的各部门，都在反对不合理制度，为工人服务的口号下提高了工作效率，我们医院至今还工作不够八小时。如果我们有决心为工人服务，我提议立即行动起来：自动加班做够八小时……”她的话立时得到了大家的拥护。经过检讨与批评，大家好象找到了一条光荣的路——医务人员回到工人阶级的队伍里，更好的为工人阶级服务。
    那座拥有四百九十四位职员的开滦办公大楼，解放前是封建等级社会的最好的缩影。它不独和“煤黑子”们绝不往来，就是各级职员之间，也象有一道不可逾越的鸿沟。据说大楼内有四个厕所，其中三个是为不足五分之一的高级与高中级职员所设。上三百多人的中级职员，尽管时常“满座”地拥挤在一个厕所里，但绝不准到那挂着“专用厕所”牌子的地方去。初级员司根本没有室内厕所，要走出洋楼，到那露天的“墩坑”去。工会委员郑世荣告我说：“这一切人间不平，都成为过去的事了，它永远也不会复活了！”职员们现为一种新的，团结的气氛所笼罩。郑世荣指着他旁边的一位老先生说：“恽先生是高级员司，现在和我们一起办工会了！”恽济今年五十八岁了，他戴着一付近视镜，吃力的捉着铅笔，在复写工会会员的简历。他已被选为候补委员，介绍他特点的纸单上，写着他是：：“老积极”。我曾问他：“假若过去叫你入工会，你会不会感到是对你人格的侮辱？”恽先生哈哈的笑着：“现在，可没人这样想了！”学习委员张士镛，他说近来职员思想上都起了很大变化。在取消包工大柜时，工会要组织一个宣传队，想吸收些职员参加，让他去动员，他很没信心，觉着这些人难起动，但“当我宣布自愿参加的时候，原计划着三十个人就够了，这下来了五十多。”他说职员们经过学习运动，再不认为“煤黑子”低下了，都愿紧紧的往工人一边靠。是的，职员们回到工人阶级的队伍之后，也以主人的态度向着各种不合理制度斗争了。公文开始改用中文了。涉及到职员自身利益的，还是近来酝酿中的“打掉鼻烟壶”运动——事情是这样引起的：开滦原有一种周年加薪与凭“功”升级制，近年来因种种困难而终止。解放后，困难依然很严重，而且由于美帝帮蒋匪封锁而困难更增加了。在这种情况下，职员们自觉起来克服困难，毫无怨言的工作着。但在七八月间，矿务总局突然发下恢复加薪升级制的命令，提升了一些人，也给一些人加薪了。于是舆论大哗，群情怒起。有的说困难还没有过去，矿方不积极设法克服困难，反在急急忙忙为少数人升级加薪，将会加重目前的困难。有的说，开滦职工工资的悬殊，为全国各大企业所没有，本来就不合理，工人早在反对了。更有的说升级从来就是根据矿方的喜好，谁送礼多，会巴结，就升一级。在今天人民的时代，这种作风一定要反对掉。于是连被增了薪的也卷入反对的浪潮。我曾问过增了薪的张鸿仪，他是一个普通职员，原每月底薪一百五十元，现在加到一百七十一元，比普通工人固然高两倍，但不及那些高级职员的十分之一。更不及特高级职员的百分之一。他反对的理由是：为了长远利益，宁愿牺牲一些暂时利益。他说：“现在已经比工人农民的生活阔得太多了。”他认为目前不是加薪和升级的问题，而应当让那些高级与特高级的往下降降才合理。打掉“鼻烟壶”就是从这里提起，职员一致认为：开滦目前还有很大一批人是拿着高薪厚禄而不做事的。有人把它比做座钟挂表或古玩，只能欣赏与看看。有人说钟表还能报时刻，这批人简直就是接烟灰、盛火柴把的烟灰盒。那是在一个职员学习大会上，说到这里人们用力鼓掌，他们齐声喊出：请不要忙着为少数人增薪升级吧！先去掉这批“鼻烟壶”，为克服目前的困难而努力吧！（注：在职员反对下，加薪升级的命令已收回了）
    在工人眼睛里，向来把职员看做资本家的代言人，现在他们紧紧的站在一起，以国家主人的领导地位，为反对不合理制度，为克服困难，实现恢复与发展生产的任务而团结起来了。
