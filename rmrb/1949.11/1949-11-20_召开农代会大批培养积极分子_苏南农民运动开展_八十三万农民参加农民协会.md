　　Convening Farmers' Representative Congresses and Massively Cultivating Activists
  　The Development of the Peasant Movement in Southern Jiangsu
    830,000 Peasants Participating in Farmers' Associations
    [Our Newspaper Wuxi Special Dispatch] The peasant movement in Southern Jiangsu has unfolded on a broad scale. In the month from September 10th to October 10th, thirteen counties convened county-level Farmers' Representative Congresses and established county-level Farmers' Association Preparatory Committees. Including those established in July and August, twenty-four counties have now established county-level Farmers' Association Preparatory Committees. Nine-tenths of the districts have established district-level Farmers' Association Preparatory Committees, and more than two-thirds of the townships have established township-level Farmers' Association Preparatory Committees. According to incomplete statistics from eighteen counties, the number of Farmers' Association members has reached 830,000 (slightly less than 11% of the total population of 7,660,000 in the eighteen counties). Currently, membership is still rapidly expanding. In some townships in Wuxi and Wu counties where work teams are present, the highest point of Farmers' Association membership development has reached over 60% of the population. During this period, the Farmers' Association Preparatory Committees in eighteen counties held seventy-three training sessions, training 12,458 cadres and over 39,900 activists.
    The reasons for the development of the peasant movement in Southern Jiangsu are: (1) The focus of the entire Party's work has shifted to rural work. In late August, in addition to the Southern Jiangsu Farmers' Association Preparatory Committee organizing rural work groups of more than 2,500 people from Wuxi and Wu counties to go to the countryside, various sub-districts and counties also organized work groups or teams of varying sizes to go to the countryside. In their work, they grasped the key points, and the breakthrough at key points sparked the unfolding of the overall situation. (2) All counties grasped the good organizational form and working method of the Farmers' Representative Conference, and successively convened farmers' representative conferences at the county, district, and township levels. Experience has proven that convening Farmers' Representative Conferences is one of the best working methods for mobilizing the masses in newly liberated rural areas. It can bring together a large number of farmer representatives, demonstrating the strength of the peasants, encouraging each other, and at the same time, after education through the meeting, discover and cultivate a large number of activists, which can spark a wave of movement in the shortest time. Therefore, it requires less effort and yields greater results. According to Wuxi materials, 80% of the county Farmers' Representative delegates were elected as members of Farmers' Association Preparatory Committees at all levels. After the representatives returned to their villages, the biggest gain was that their political awareness was improved, their work was active, the rumors of bandits and special agents were shattered, and they felt their own glory and became masters. (3) Through solving the autumn famine, mutual assistance and mutual aid among farmers, breaking the economic blockade of landlords and rich peasants against the farmers, suppressing bandits and opposing local bullies, production and disaster relief, autumn harvesting and planting, and agricultural loans, they have effectively helped farmers solve various practical difficulties, and launched struggles of all sizes against the feudal landlord class's rumors and sabotage. Moreover, taking production as the center, solving various difficulties in farmers' production, and breaking the economic blockade of landlords to carry out the anti-feudal struggle is the most likely to win the support of the majority of farmers in the new district and the sympathy of social opinion. The work of suppressing bandits is centered on border areas and areas with bandit activity. Under the leadership of the Farmers' Association, the masses have universally organized armed self-defense forces. According to statistics from Wuxi County, there are already 45,000 anti-bandit and home-guarding team members. As for the struggle against local bullies, it is still being carried out with a focus on key points. (4) Overcoming the tendency of closed-doorism in the development path, it is necessary to let go and develop Farmers' Association members. Except for landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries, all farmers should be absorbed into the Farmers' Association. Therefore, in terms of development methods, it is necessary to publicize and explain the Farmers' Association charter through Farmers' Representative Congresses at all levels, and openly call for registration and membership at the congresses, combined with individual registration procedures. The biggest characteristic of the farmers in the new district of Southern Jiangsu is that most of them are literate, have quick political sensitivity, and are receptive. Under the oppression of the combined feudal rule of the Japanese puppets and the Kuomintang, their suffering is deep. Therefore, their desire to turn over politically and economically is extremely strong, and they are also active and tenacious. At present, the peasant movement in Southern Jiangsu is continuing to develop, continuing to organize and expand Farmers' Association membership, and fighting to welcome the completion of the autumn grain requisition and the implementation of rent reduction.

　　召开农代会大批培养积极分子
  　苏南农民运动开展
    八十三万农民参加农民协会
    【本报无锡专讯】苏南农民运动，已在广阔的范围内展开。九月十日至十月十日的一个月中，有十三个县召开了县农民代表大会，成立了县农民协会筹委会，连七、八月份成立的在内，已有廿四个县成立了县农协筹委会，十分之九的区建立了区农筹会，三分之二以上的乡建立乡农筹会，农协会员，据十八个县不完全统计，已达八十三万人（占十八个县总人口七百六十六万的百分之十一弱），目前会员仍在猛烈发展中。在无锡、吴县部分有工作队的乡，农协会员发展最高点占人口百分之六十以上。在此期间，十八个县农筹会举办了七十三次训练，训练了一万二千四百五十八名干部，三万九千九百余积极分子。
    苏南农民运动获得发展的原因：（一）全党的工作重心，已经转向以农村工作为主。八月下旬，除苏南农筹会组织无锡、吴县两个农村工作团二千五百余人下乡外，各分区各县亦均组织大小不同的工作团或工作队下乡，在工作上抓紧了重点，由点的突破掀起了面的开展。（二）各县均抓紧了农民代表会议这一良好的组织形式与工作方法，纷纷召开了县、区、乡各级农民代表会议。经验证明，召开农民代表会议，是新区农村发动群众最好的工作方法之一，能够集中数量众多的农民代表在一起，显示出农民的力量，彼此鼓舞情绪，同时通过会议教育后，发现培养出大批的积极分子，能在最短期内，掀起运动热潮，故费力小，而收效大，据无锡材料，县农代代表百分之八十均被选为各级农筹委员。代表回乡后，最大的收获是政治觉悟提高，工作积极，匪特的谣言粉碎了，感觉自己的光荣，做了主人。（三）通过解决秋荒，农民互助互济，打破地主富农对农民的经济封锁，剿匪反霸，生产救灾，秋收秋种以及农贷等工作，切实的帮助农民解决了各种实际困难，开展了反对封建地主阶级造谣破坏等的大大小小的斗争。而且以生产为中心，解决农民生产中各种困难，打破地主经济封锁，来开展反封建斗争，是最能取得广大新区农民的拥护与社会舆论同情。剿匪工作以边区和有匪情地区为中心，各地均在农会领导下，普遍组织了群众自卫武装。据无锡县统计，防匪保家队已有四万五千人。至于反霸斗争尚在有重点的进行。（四）克服了发展路线上关门主义倾向，必须放手发展农协会员，除了地主富农与反革命分子外，应该把全部农民吸收到农会里来，因此，发展方式上，必需通过各级农代大会，宣传解释农会章程，在大会上公开号召，报名入会并与个别履行登记手续相结合。苏南新区农民最大的特点，是大多数都认得字，政治敏感性快，接受力强，在日伪和国民党结合封建统治压迫下，痛苦深，因此政治上经济上要求翻身的斗争情绪极为强烈，而且积极顽强。目前苏南各地农运，正在继续开展，继续组织扩大农会会员，为迎接完成秋征，贯彻减租而斗争。
