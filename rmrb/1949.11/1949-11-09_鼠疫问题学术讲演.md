　　Academic Lecture on Plague Issues
　　Wang Jinjiang's Notes
　　At 5:30 PM on the 4th of this month, an academic lecture on plague issues was held at Peking University Hospital. Dr. Wu Chao-ren, Professor of Internal Medicine at Peking University Medical College, spoke about the clinical symptoms of plague; Dr. Fang Liang, Professor of Bacteriology, spoke about the plague bacillus; Mr. Zhao Zhen-sheng, Professor of Parasitology, spoke about fleas and plague; and Dr. Yan Jing-qing, Professor of Public Health, spoke about plague prevention work. The main contents of the lectures are as follows:

　　Wu Chao-ren
　　Plague is caused by the plague bacillus. In China, three types of plague have been discovered: (1) Bubonic plague: incubation period of two to eight days, sudden onset, fever, chills, and neurological symptoms such as headache, coma, etc. If left untreated, death can occur from heart failure within three to five days. A small number of cases can be cured. (2) Septicemic plague: can occur when a large number of bacteria enter the blood. The symptoms are more severe than the former. Both of these can cause secondary pneumonic plague, which is different from the primary one. (3) Pneumonic plague: Plague bacilli are excreted from rat feces. After drying, they are inhaled into the lungs through dust. Incubation period of two to three days, headache, chills, rapid increase in fever, chest tightness, cough, sputum initially thick, then becoming thin, sputum containing bright red blood. The symptoms are different from pneumonia caused by pneumococcus. The mortality rate of pneumonic plague is higher than that of bubonic plague.

　　Fang Liang
　　The pathogen is a Gram-negative short bacillus with metachromatic granules at both ends. It is easily cultured in general culture media and can withstand low temperatures. It can be preserved in the refrigerator for twenty years. Fleas are the medium for transmitting the plague bacillus. There are three methods of transmission: first, the bacteria are introduced into the human body when a flea bites; second, the flea regurgitates the bacteria; third, the bacteria adhere to the skin with the flea's feces and are introduced into the blood when the skin is scratched due to itching. This is the source of bubonic plague. Pneumonic plague is transmitted through the saliva, sneezes, and coughs of patients. In bacteriology, it can be divided into marine plague (such as in India, Java, etc., with lower toxicity) and continental plague (such as in Northeast China, Inner Mongolia, etc.). In bacterial diagnosis, attention should be paid to taking materials such as sputum and lymph nodes. The examination methods are: first, directly smear and stain the material, and observe under a microscope. This method cannot distinguish between pseudo-plague bacilli. Second, culture method, using plague bacilli for animal experiments (such as guinea pigs, mice) to dissect and observe lesions for diagnosis. Third, the method of using bacteriophages or serum (agglutination reaction) test. This method is not widely used. The most important thing is to perform blood culture examination before the patient dies, which is more convenient and reliable. If this disease is not treated properly, the chance of natural cure is very small; but if survival occurs, the body will have considerable immunity to the plague. There are now two types of preventive injections: one is made with dead bacteria, and the other is made with live bacteria. The latter is twice as effective as the former and has no danger. Immunity can be generated ten days after injection and can last for half a year.

　　Zhao Zhen-sheng
　　Regarding the types of fleas, as far as we know now, there are 81 species in China, 38 in North China, and 6 or 7 in Beijing. The most common ones are 5 species (one on humans, two on rats, one on cats, and one on dogs). Fleas can be distinguished by the shape of their heads. Fleas live on humans, rats, cats, dogs, and in their living places. Fleas can jump seven feet high and ten feet far. After laying eggs, they fall to the ground and turn into larvae in two or three days, pupate in seven to nine days, and become adults in nine to fifteen days. They live by sucking blood, sucking blood several times on one person to be full. When the host dies or there are pathological changes (body temperature changes), it leaves to find another host. When plague bacilli enter the flea's stomach, they multiply. Due to the structure of the stomach (proventriculus), it is easily blocked by the multiplying bacteria, making it difficult to suck blood into the stomach, or often regurgitates, thus sending the bacteria into human blood. This mechanical transmission of bacteria into the human body is the most important route of transmission of the plague. The lifespan of fleas can be up to two or three years, but generally can last for more than three months.

　　Yan Jing-qing
　　The plague outbreak in Chahar Province in early October was transmitted from Inner Mongolia. A total of 34 patients were discovered, and sputum and blood tests confirmed that it was plague. People generally have a sense of terror about this historical disease, because there was the spread of the Black Death in Europe in the 14th century, and this disease still exists to this day. Plague exists in various parts of China, such as Northeast China, Chahar Province, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Yunnan, Fujian, Jiangxi, Hunan, Zhejiang, Guangdong, and Anhui, but this is not universal, there are centers of infection (endemic diseases), which can be divided into epidemic areas (such as Chahar Province) and non-epidemic areas (such as Beijing). Therefore, there are different strategies for infectious disease management. The main thing is to try to avoid the spread of plague to non-epidemic areas, which requires strict blockade of epidemic areas, and quarantine of travelers from near epidemic areas, isolating travelers for about ten days to observe whether they develop the disease. At present, the focus of epidemic prevention work in this city is quarantine and blockade. The general principles of infectious disease management are like war. First, we must eliminate the enemy's forces, so first we must have sufficient and accurate intelligence, knowing the enemy's whereabouts and situation; second, we must strengthen our own forces, so we get vaccinations and inject serum. If we understand the enemy's attack methods, we can prevent them. For example, pneumonic plague requires avoiding respiratory transmission, and bubonic plague requires avoiding flea bites. At the same time, the target of the bacteria is the rat population (center of infection). Rodents can be divided into two types: those that live with humans, such as gray rats and small mice; and wild ones, such as marmots and large-eyed voles. The plague outbreak in Chahar Province this time is preliminarily speculated to be due to the spread of wild species. Rat catching is very important in preventing the spread of plague. Currently, there are a very large number of rats in our environment, at least as many as the entire population of Beijing. We must mobilize the masses to reduce the rat population and eliminate rats, which requires the power of the masses!

　　In summary, the key to preventing plague is to improve grassroots organizations, coordinate administration and technology, mobilize the masses, and implement thoroughly.

　　鼠疫问题学术讲演
    王锦江摘记
    本月四日下午五时半，在北大医院举行了一个鼠疫问题的学术讲演会，由北大医学院内科教授吴朝仁大夫讲鼠疫病的临床症状，细菌学科教授方亮大夫讲鼠疫杆菌，寄生虫学科教授赵振声先生讲跳蚤和鼠疫，公共卫生学科教授严镜清大夫讲鼠疫的防疫工作，讲演的主要内容如下：
　　吴朝仁
    鼠疫病是由鼠疫杆菌所致。在中国发现的鼠疫有三种：（一）腺鼠疫：潜伏期二至八天，突然发病，发热发冷，有神经系症状如头痛、昏迷等，病后三至五天不治即可死于心脏衰弱，亦有少数治愈者。（二）败血性鼠疫：多量细菌进入血内则可发生，病症比前者为重，此二种皆可引起续发性肺鼠疫与原发者不同。（三）肺鼠疫：鼠疫杆菌从鼠的粪便中排出体外，干燥后经尘埃由人口中吸入肺内、潜伏期二、三天，头疼，发冷，热度增加很快，胸部紧张不适，咳嗽，吐痰最初粘稠，后来变稀，痰中有鲜红色血液，症状和肺炎球菌所致的肺炎不同，肺鼠疫的死亡率比腺鼠疫的大。
　　方亮
    病原体为格兰氏染色阴性的短菌杆，两端有异染体，在普遍培养基中容易培养能耐低温，在冰箱内可保存二十年。跳蚤为传播鼠疫杆菌的媒介，传染方法有三种：第一是跳蚤咬人时将菌输入人体：第二是跳蚤的反胃将菌吐出；第三是细菌随着蚤的粪便粘着人的皮肤上，因刺痒搔破而将菌体送入血内，这是腺鼠疫的来源。肺鼠疫的传染方法是病人的唾液，喷嚏，咳嗽传染的。在细菌学上可分为海洋性的鼠疫（如印度、爪哇等地，毒性较小）及大陆性的鼠疫（如东北、内蒙等地）。在细菌诊断上应注意取材料如痰及淋巴腺，检查方法第一是直接将材料抹片、染色，用显微镜观察，用此法对假性鼠疫杆菌无法区别。第二是培养法，用鼠疫杆菌作动物实验（如荷兰猪，小鼠）解剖观察病变断定。第三是用噬菌素或血清（凝集反应）试验的方法，这种方法并不普遍应用，最要注意的是在病人尚未死前要作血液的培养检查较为便利可靠。这种病若不适当治疗，则自然治愈的机会很少；但若免于死亡，则身体对鼠疫病就有了相当大的免疫力。现在预防注射有两种：一种是用死菌作的，一种是用活菌作的，后者比前者的效力可大一倍，并无危险，于注射后经十天可以产生免疫力，可持久半年。
  　赵振声
    关于跳蚤的种类据现在所知道的，全中国有八十一种，华北有三十八种，北京有六、七种、最常见的可有五种（一种在人身上的，二种在老鼠身上的，一种在猫身上的，一种在狗身上的），按头部的形状可以区别跳蚤生活在人、鼠、猫、狗的身上和居住的处所，跳蚤能跳七英尺高、一○英尺远，下卵后落在地上经二、三天变成幼虫，经七至九天成蛹，再经九至十五天变成成虫。它靠吸血生活，在一个人身上吸好几次血才能饱。当寄主死去后或有病理变化（体温改变），即离去另找其他寄主。鼠疫杆菌进入跳蚤胃内即行繁殖，因胃（胃前囊）的构造关系，很容易被繁殖的菌体所阻塞，以致不容易将血吸入胃内，或时常反胃，因此将菌体送入人血内，此种机械式的将菌体传入人体也就是鼠疫病最主要的传染路径了。跳蚤的生活期间最多有二、三年之久，普遍可以有三个多月。
  　严镜清
    这次十月初察北的鼠疫发生是由内蒙传来的，共发现三十四个病人，经痰及血的检查证明了是鼠疫。一般人对这种历史性的疾病都有恐怖感，因为在十四世纪欧洲就有黑死病的蔓延，这种病一直到现在仍然存在。鼠疫在中国各地如东北、察北、山西、陕西、云南、福建、江西、湖南、浙江、两广、安徽等地都存在，但这并非普遍的，是有传染中心的（地方病），可以分疫区（如察北）和非疫区（如北京），因此对于传染病管理上就有不同的方针了，主要的是设法避免鼠疫向非疫区传布，这就需要对疫区严格的封锁，对由疫区附近来的旅客需要检疫，将旅客隔离十天左右，观察是否发病，眼前本市防疫工作的重点也就是检疫和封锁。一般的传染病管理原则犹如战争，第一要消灭敌人的势力，因此首先要有充分和准确的情报，知道敌人的处所和情况；第二是要加强自己的力量，因此打预防针，注射血清。假若我们了解敌人袭击的方式，就可以预防。譬如肺鼠疫要避免呼吸系的传染，腺鼠疫要避免蚤咬。同时病菌的对象是鼠群（传染中心），啮齿动物可分两种：与人同居的有灰鼠、小耗子；野生的有旱獭、大眼贼。此次察北的鼠疫流行，初步的推测大概是由于野生类的传布。捕鼠工作在防止鼠疫病的蔓延上是很重要的，目前在我们的环境里鼠的数目非常多，至少有全北京市人口这样多，我们必须发动群众来减少鼠口，消灭老鼠，这就要靠群众的力量！
    总括说，防止鼠疫的要则是健全基层组织，行政与技术配合，发动群众，澈底执行。
