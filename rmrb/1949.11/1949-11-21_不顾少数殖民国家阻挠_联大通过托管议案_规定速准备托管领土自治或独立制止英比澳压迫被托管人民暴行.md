Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 20th – TASS, New York: Despite opposition from a few colonial powers, the United Nations General Assembly, on November 15th, passed by an overwhelming majority six resolutions from the Fourth Committee (Trusteeship Committee) report. Although these resolutions are not thorough, they do include certain recommendations stipulating speedy preparations for the autonomy and independence of the people of trust territories, as required by the United Nations Charter. The resolution regarding the political situation of trust territories stipulates that the administrative authorities shall, within the next year, submit to the Trusteeship Council a general plan on how the administrative authority intends to expedite the development of the trust territory towards autonomy and independence. Several other resolutions instruct the administrative authorities to implement certain measures regarding the economic and social development and education in trust territories. The Trusteeship Council is specifically instructed to take urgent measures to immediately stop the barbaric acts of whipping local people in the British, Belgian, and Australian trust territories, and to abolish discriminatory laws and practices imposed by the administrative authorities on indigenous residents of trust territories.

During the discussion, many countries without colonies supported the resolutions of the Fourth Committee. Colonial countries opposed these resolutions, but this time they failed to muster a sufficient number of delegations to prevent their passage. All six resolutions of the committee were passed by a two-thirds majority of the General Assembly. However, colonial countries, led by the United States delegation, ultimately deleted some valuable suggestions from the resolution on the political situation of trust territories.

The General Assembly then discussed the Fourth Committee's resolution on the "administrative unions" of trust territories and colonies. Discussions in the Trusteeship Council on reports from the administrative authorities revealed that colonial countries, under the pretext of establishing so-called "administrative unions," wanted to establish "political unions" between trust territories and colonies, reducing trust territories to the political and economic appendages of the colonies in these unions. This is particularly true of territories under British trusteeship. The resolution submitted by the Fourth Committee to the General Assembly instructs the Trusteeship Council to complete its review of the "administrative unions" issue. The resolution emphasizes that the Trusteeship Council should pay attention to the fact that the administrative authorities "shall not establish any 'political union' in any way annexing trust territories or any union that would cause trust territories to lose their status."

During the vote, colonial countries led by Britain and France again opposed this resolution of the committee. But as a result, the Fourth Committee's resolution on "administrative unions" was still passed by a majority vote. Forty-four countries voted in favor of the resolution, including the Soviet Union, the Ukrainian Republic, Poland, the Byelorussian Republic, Czechoslovakia, Pakistan, Guatemala, Egypt, and many other small countries. Nine countries voted against, including Britain, France, Belgium, and Australia.

　　不顾少数殖民国家阻挠
　　联大通过托管议案
    规定速准备托管领土自治或独立制止英比澳压迫被托管人民暴行
    【新华社北京二十日电】塔斯社纽约讯：不顾少数殖民国家的反对，联合国大会于十一月十五日以绝大多数通过了第四委员会（托管委员会）报告中的六个议案。虽然这些议案很不彻底，但终究还包括了某些建议，规定从速进行托管领土人民的自治及独立的准备工作，这是联合国宪章所要求的。关于托管领土政治情势的议案规定：行政当局应在明年之内，向托管理事会提出该行政当局打算如何尽速使托管领土朝自治及独立方向发展的总计划。其它几个议案责成行政当局实行托管领土的经济及社会发展方面及教育方面的若干措施。托管理事会特地责成要采取紧急措施以立即制止在英、比、澳托管领土对当地人民的鞭鞑暴行，并废除行政当局对托管领土土著居民所施行的歧视法律及歧视惯例。
    在进行讨论时，许多没有殖民地的国家支持第四委员会的议案。殖民国家则反对这些议案，但是他们这次却并未能纠集足够数目的代表团来阻止这些议案的通过。委员会的六个议案全部都以大会的三分之二多数获得通过。然而以美国代表团为首的殖民国家最后仍然删除了关于托管领土政治情势议案中的某些宝贵建议。
    大会接着讨论第四委员会关于托管领土与殖民地“行政联盟”的议案。在托管理事会对行政当局报告的讨论中可以看出，殖民国家要在成立所谓“行政联盟”的借口之下，成立托管领土与殖民地的“政治联盟”，托管领土在这些联盟里降到殖民地的政治及经济附属品的地位。这确是在英国托管下的领土的特别情况。第四委员会向大会提出的议案，责成托管理事会完成对“行政联盟”问题的审查。议案强调托管理事会应该注意，行政当局“不得成立以任何方式兼并托管领土的任何”政治联盟“或成立会使托管领土丧失其地位的任何联盟”。
    在表决时，以英国和法国为首的殖民国家又反对委员会这个议案。但结果，第四委员会关于“行政联盟”的议案仍以多数票通过。四十四国投票赞成这个议案，其中包括苏联、乌克兰共和国、波兰、白俄罗斯共和国、捷克斯洛伐克、巴基斯坦、危地马拉、埃及及其他许多小国，九国投票反对，其中包括英国、法国、比利时、澳大利亚等国。
