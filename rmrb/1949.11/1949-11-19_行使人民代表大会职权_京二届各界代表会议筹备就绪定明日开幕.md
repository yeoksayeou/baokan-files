　　Exercising the Powers of the People's Representative Conference
　　Preparations Complete for the Second Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference, Set to Open Tomorrow
    [Beijing News] The Second Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference is scheduled to open on the 20th of this month. This conference will exercise the powers of the People's Representative Conference, electing the Mayor and Deputy Mayors of Beijing, and members of the Beijing Municipal People's Government Committee. This is the first time that People's Representative Conferences of a similar nature across the country have acted on behalf of the People's Congress to exercise its powers.
    After the First Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference, a People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee was established in accordance with the conference resolutions, and three consultative meetings were held continuously, preparing for the Second Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference. The allocation of representative quotas, the organizational regulations of the People's Representative Conference, and the provisional organizational outline of the Beijing Municipal People's Government have all been discussed in groups and repeatedly consulted by all members of the Consultative Committee, then drafted and prepared to be submitted to the Second Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference for discussion and approval. The Consultative Committee has also discussed the five financial and taxation proposals that the Beijing Municipal People's Government will present at the Second People's Representative Conference, and will carry out new sorting and reforms of the city's tax types and tax rates. In addition, the Consultative Committee has also held multiple consultations on issues such as worker dismissal and relief, and the establishment of large-scale worker spare-time schools, preparing to submit proposals to the Second Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference.
    Exercising the powers of the People's Representative Conference, electing the Mayor and Deputy Mayors, and members of the Beijing Municipal People's Government Committee will make the Second Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference the highest local authority in the city. The conditions for doing so have matured in Beijing, and the State Council of the Central People's Government has also approved this approach. This is the greatest characteristic of this conference. Another characteristic of this conference is the allocation of representative quotas. The representatives elected by people's organizations total 298, reaching 70 percent of the total number of representatives (424). The remaining ex officio government representatives are only 14, accounting for 3.4 percent of the total number of representatives; representatives elected by political parties are 27, accounting for 6.4 percent of the total number of representatives. The others are 85 representatives invited by the Military Control Commission, the Municipal Government, and the Consultative Committee through consultation. The increase in the number of elected representatives, especially the expansion of the proportion of representatives elected by people's organizations, proves that the representative composition of this People's Representative Conference can more directly connect with the masses, broadly represent the will of the people, and possess the conditions to exercise the highest power of the people.

　　行使人民代表大会职权
  　京二届各界代表会议筹备就绪定明日开幕
    【北京讯】北京市第二届各界人民代表会议定于本月二十日开幕。此次会议将行使人民代表大会的职权，选举北京市市长、副市长和北京市人民政府委员会委员。这是全国各地同样性质的各界人民代表会议第一次代行人民代表大会的职权。
    在北京市第一届各界人民代表会议之后，曾根据大会决议，成立各界人民代表会议协议委员会，连续举行过三次协商会议，并为第二届各界人民代表会议进行了准备工作。关于代表名额的分配、各界人民代表会议的组织条例和北京市人民政府暂行组织大纲，都经过协议委员会的分组讨论和全体委员的反复协商，然后作成草案，准备在第二届各界人民代表会议中提交大会讨论通过。协议委员会还讨论了北京市人民政府将在第二届各界人民代表会议中提出的五项财政税收案，对本市税收种类和税率将进行新的整理与改革，此外，对工人解雇与救济问题和举办大规模的工人业余学校等问题，协议委员会亦经过多次协商，准备向第二届各界人民代表大会提出议案。
    行使人民代表大会职权，选举市长、副市长和北京市人民政府委员会委员，将使北京市第二届各界人民代表会议成为全市最高的地方权力机关。这样做的条件在北京市已经成熟，中央人民政府政务院对这样的办法亦已批准。这是本届各界人民代表会议的最大特点。本届会议的另一特点则为代表名额的分配。人民团体所推选的代表计二九八名，达到代表总额（四二四名）的百分之七十。其余政府当然代表仅十四名，占代表总额百分之三·四；党派推选代表二十七名，占代表总额百分之六·四。其他为军管会、市政府与协议委员会协议邀请的代表，计八十五人。推选代表的增加，特别是人民团体推选代表所占比率的扩大，证明本届各界人民代表会议的代表成分更能直接联系群众，广泛地代表人民的意志，具备了行使人民最高权力的条件。
