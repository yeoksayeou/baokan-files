Xinhua News Agency, Dalian, 3rd. The Chinese Communist Party Committee of the Dalian Chinese Chang Railway Bureau recently studied and researched the decision of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and the Industry Department of the Northeast People's Government on launching a mass movement to create new production records in light of specific circumstances. It then called on all units under the bureau to widely carry out this movement. Now, employees in the bureau's locomotive, crew, and railway factory units have responded enthusiastically, and the movement has been widely launched and has begun to produce many new records. For example, the Transportation Division created a record of shortening vehicle turnover by one and a half days on October 10th; the foundry of Dalian Railway Factory created a record of melting 69 tons of iron in October using a ten-ton melting furnace. Since March of this year, the bureau has successively launched locomotive over-traction competition, rationalization proposal movement, and production saving competition, which have achieved great results in improving transportation efficiency and saving materials, electricity, fuel, oil, etc., and laid a solid foundation for launching the new record movement.
