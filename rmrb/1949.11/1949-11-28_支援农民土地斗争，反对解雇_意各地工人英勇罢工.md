In San Giuseppe Jato, thirty people were arrested, including all members of the two farmers' cooperative councils. The working people of Palermo unanimously demanded the release of those arrested. "Unità" reported that farmers in the provinces of Palermo, Agrigento, and Caltanissetta continue to occupy abandoned land.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 27th: According to TASS Rome: Simultaneously with the heroic struggle of Italian agricultural workers to win land, the struggle of Italian industrial workers against layoffs is also flourishing. Workers at the Ansaldo factory in Pozzuoli (in the province of Naples) continue to occupy the factory they occupied on October 28th in protest against layoffs. On November 9th, all metallurgical enterprises in the province of Naples held a one-hour strike in solidarity. At the same time, a campaign to raise funds for striking workers is widely underway throughout the province. Workers at the Ilva factory in Marghera, Venice province, also went on strike to protest the factory's preparation to unjustly dismiss 75 workers. In the province of Ferrara, the struggle of the working people against the unjust dismissal of workers by the metallurgical factory is still ongoing. Workers in some enterprises in Rome have also joined the anti-layoff struggle. Workers in smaller-scale enterprises in the provinces of Perugia, Turin, and Bari have also joined this struggle. The struggle of workers at the Fiat factory in Turin has been victorious.
