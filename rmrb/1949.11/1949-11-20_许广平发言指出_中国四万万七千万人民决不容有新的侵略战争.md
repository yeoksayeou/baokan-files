　　Xu Guangping's Speech Points Out
　　The 470 Million People of China Will Never Allow a New War of Aggression
　　In her speech, Xu Guangping pointed out that Chinese women wholeheartedly support the Central People's Government and are confident that the People's Republic of China will become one of the strong bastions of lasting peace in the Pacific and the world. The 475 million free Chinese people will never allow a new war of aggression. We firmly believe in the victory of the international peace camp headed by the Soviet Union.
　　Mrs. Edwarda Orłowska, Vice-Chairman of the Polish Women's League, said that the leading body of the Polish Women's League, representing its millions of members, proposed to the Secretariat of the Women's International Democratic Federation (WIDF): to expel the current representative of Yugoslavia who supports the Tito group's betrayal policy from the WIDF. Mrs. Orłowska said that we firmly believe that the true representatives of the heroic Yugoslav women will soon appear in the WIDF, and these women will be holding high the banner against the Tito traitors and spies.

　　许广平发言指出
  　中国四万万七千万人民决不容有新的侵略战争
    许广平发言时指出，中国妇女全心全意拥护中央人民政府，并且确信中华人民共和国将成为太平洋和全世界持久和平的强大的堡垒之一。四万万七千五百万自由的中国人民决不允许有新的侵略战争。我们坚信以苏联为首的国际和平阵营的胜利。
    波兰妇女联盟副主席爱德华尔达·奥尔洛夫斯卡夫人说，波兰妇女联盟领导机关代表其数以百万计的盟员，向国际民主妇联书记处提议：把拥护铁托集团叛卖政策的南斯拉夫现行代表开除出国际民主妇联。奥尔洛夫斯卡夫人说，我们深信，不久将有英勇的南斯拉夫妇女的真正代表出现在国际民主妇联，而这些妇女是高举着反对铁托叛徒和间谍的旗帜的。
