The Vietnamese working class stands at the forefront of the war and is the main force in the Vietnamese national liberation movement. Since 1930, it has bravely shouldered this glorious and arduous task. In 1941, when the All-Vietnam Anti-Aggression United Front was formed, it became the core of the united front.

The self-defense war of the entire Vietnamese people against French imperialism has been going on for four years. In this process, the Vietnamese working class has spared no effort to sacrifice everything, even their lives, in order to win the liberation of the entire nation. Although Vietnamese workers account for only 3% of the national population, they make up 10% of the entire army. Through long-term war tempering, countless national heroes have emerged from the workers. Hong Tao, a landmine ambush hero from Fifth Street, Saigon-Tia'an District, and Sha Dao, familiar to the Vietnamese people, are both outstanding workers. The vast rubber plantation workers are persisting in guerrilla warfare against the enemy in the Saigon area. In the famous battles of Hanoi, Haiphong, Da Nang, and Nam Dinh, the working class has played its unparalleled heroic and exemplary role.

In addition to participating in armed struggle, the working class leads and unites the broad masses of people, especially the poor peasants, to systematically destroy everything that can be used by the enemy, so that the enemy cannot obtain useful materials in Vietnam. After the thorough destruction of highways and bridges, the enemy's transportation vehicles cannot operate on them. Even if there are enemy troops moving on foot, they are constantly attacked by the guerrillas led by the working class.

In wartime economic construction, the working class has overcome countless difficulties and worked hard in production to supply military and civilian needs. At the beginning of the Liberation War, Vietnam's industry was very depressed and agriculture was very backward. Today, farmers are able to supply military and civilian food, and workers have built factories in places with harsh climates and poor material conditions, and can also supply the army with military supplies, and gradually increase the production of daily necessities to ensure the army's needs in the war and achieve economic self-sufficiency.

The Vietnamese working class is now carrying out a fierce anti-imperialist war together with the people of the whole country. The victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War has given them great encouragement. They are eager to learn more from their Chinese brothers about the experience of smashing imperialist aggression.

The Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference has now been held, and the Vietnamese working class has been looking forward to this conference for a long time. They eagerly hope to exchange the experiences of struggle between Chinese and Vietnamese brothers and workers in Southeast Asian countries at this meeting. They are even more eager to have a program under the leadership of the World Federation of Trade Unions that is more suitable for the specific situation in Southeast Asia. The Vietnamese working class will follow this direction and exert even more powerful power under the leadership of the people's leader Ho Chi Minh.

　　越南工人阶级在民族解放战争中   
    记越南代表刘德福谈话
    靳羽
    越南工人阶级站在战争的最前线，是越南民族解放运动中的主力军。她在一九三○年以后便勇敢的肩负起这个光荣艰巨的任务。在一九四一年全越反侵略统一战线形成，她又成了统一战线的核心。
    全越人民反法帝国主义的自卫战争已进行四年。越南工人阶级在这过程中为了争取整个民族的解放，曾不惜牺牲自身的一切以至生命。越南工人在全国人口中仅占百分之三，但军队里的工人成份却占全部军队的百分之十。经过长期战争的锤炼，工人中产生了无数民族英雄。越南人民所熟习的西贡提岸区的洪涛（译名）第五号街的地雷埋伏英雄沙道（译名）都是优秀的工人。在西贡附近地区坚持对敌游击战争的是广大的树胶种植工人。河内、海防、岘港、南定等著名战役中，工人阶级都发挥了她无比的英勇和模范作用。
    工人阶级在参加武装斗争外，并领导和团结广大人民，特别是贫苦农民，有计划地把能为敌人利用的都彻底破坏净尽，不叫敌人在越南获得有用的物资。公路桥梁经过彻底破坏后，敌人的交通工具都不能在上面运转。纵或有徒步的敌人行动，也时刻要受到工人阶级领导的游击队所袭击。
    在战时经济建设中，工人阶级克服了无数的困难，为供应军需民用而艰苦的从事劳动生产。在解放战争之初，越南的工业很萧条，农业也很落后；到今天，农民已能供应军需民食，工人在气候恶劣，物质条件很坏的地方建起工厂来，也能以军火供应军队，并逐渐增产日用必需品，保证军队在战争中的需要，完成经济上的自给自足。
    越南工人阶级现在正在和全国人民一道，进行炽烈的反帝战争。中国人民解放战争的胜利，给了他们极大的鼓励。他们迫切希望从中国弟兄吸取更多的粉碎帝国主义侵略的经验。
    亚、澳工会会议现已举行，越南工人阶级对这个会议期待已久。他们热望在这个会议中普遍交流中越两国以及东南亚诸国工人兄弟们斗争经验。更热望在世界工联领导下有一个更适合东南亚具体情况的纲领产生。越南工人阶级将循着这个方向在人民领袖胡志明领导下发挥更强大的威力。
