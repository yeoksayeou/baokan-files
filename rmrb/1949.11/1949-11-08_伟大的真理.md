　　Great Truth
    "Soviet Woman" Magazine, Issue 3
    Translated by Bai Cun

　　In a socialist society, labor is the most glorious and noble. The romance of production is enthusiastically encouraged by the Soviet people's efforts in construction. In the Soviet Union, men and women generate new labor achievements every day, creating wealth to increase the strength of the socialist country and improve the material and cultural standards of the working people.

　　Every citizen of the Soviet Union has confidence in his future. The wealth of the country is for his own benefit, and everyone works for himself. Everyone is the master of his own destiny.

　　In capitalist countries, the reality is the complete opposite. In these countries, each day brings new poverty and disaster to the working people.

　　Let me turn to specific facts and figures, which show that the driving force of life is more eloquent than words.

　　In the past three years alone, in the Soviet Union, 4,000 state enterprises have either been restored or rebuilt. During these three years, a large number of workers engaged in national economic construction has increased by 2,000,000 people. The Soviet people do not know the meaning of unemployment. If you walk through the streets of Moscow or other Soviet cities, you can see countless advertisements recruiting staff, such as engineers, craftsmen, skilled workers, accountants, teachers, doctors, telegraph workers, shop assistants, stove managers, truck managers, electric welders, and specialized technicians, etc.

　　On the other hand, in capitalist countries, the working people are always in a state of freedom from the terror of unemployment. No one knows what tomorrow's job changes will be. Today, he can still live a pitiful life, but there is no guarantee whether his capitalist boss will need his work tomorrow.

　　In the United States, 3,000,000 people are unemployed, and nearly 10,000,000 people only have part-time jobs. In Britain, about 1,000,000 people are out of work. In Italy, there are 2,500,000 people, and in West Germany, there are over 1,000,000. In Belgium, there are 300,000, and in Greece, there are already over 300,000. If we also include the number of unemployed people in the Asian, African, and Latin American colonies and dependencies, this army of unemployed people will approach one billion. These many people live an unfortunate life, relying on relief and eating scraps of food discarded in vegetable buckets.

　　Housing construction in the Soviet Union is proceeding rapidly. Every second, houses are being built in township families, and families in neighboring collective farms are also getting their own new houses. Although the last war caused serious damage to the countryside, the people of the entire Soviet Union will have broad and happy homes in just a few years.

　　At the same time, in capitalist countries, such as the United States, the entire territory has not been subjected to a single enemy bullet, and no buildings have been damaged by the war. However, tens of millions of people sleep on the streets and in parks. Twenty percent of all houses built in the United States are rudimentary, but one-third of the population lives in them. At the same time, there are many empty houses in American cities that would be very comfortable for families if they could afford the rent, but for the average person, the rent is too high.

　　Three years ago, Comrade Stalin said: "The basic task of the new Five-Year Plan lies in restoring the areas of the country devastated by the war, restoring industry and agriculture to pre-war levels, and then exceeding or falling short of this level in essential measures."

　　The Soviet people have undertaken these tasks, and the increase in the quality of food and consumer goods has benefited the working people with an essential improvement in living standards. The Soviet government abolished food rationing long ago, and mass consumer goods are steadily returning to nationally re-priced levels. Last year alone, the Soviet population benefited by about 86,000,000,000 rubles from the re-pricing.

　　The re-pricing was re-ordered once again on March 1st of this year. The prices of bread, meat, fish, milk, butter, cigarettes, clothing, old clothes, and other foods have been reduced by 10 to 30 percent. The low prices have increased the purchasing power of the Soviet people by another 71,000,000,000 rubles.

　　In capitalist countries, large quantities of food are placed in shops and warehouses, but tens of millions of poorly dressed, poorly shod, hungry, and homeless people cannot buy the most necessary necessities of life.

　　In terms of food prices in the United States, they have increased by 54 percent in the past three years. Since the end of the war, clothing prices have risen by 36 percent, coal and firewood have risen by 23 percent, furniture has risen by 40 percent, and household goods have risen by 20 percent. However, the profits of financial tycoons and industrial tycoons in 1948 were 21,000,000,000 US dollars, exceeding the 17,400,000,000 US dollars in profits for 1947. On the one hand, there is the high rise in profits of capitalist monopolies, and on the other hand, there is the decline in the living standards of the working people.

　　In Britain, oil, meat, cotton fabrics, and a large number of other important items are still restricted. At the same time, the prices of food and industrial products are still growing. The average price increase last year totaled 9 percent, while the price of clothing has risen by 16 percent, and old clothes have risen by 28 percent.

　　According to the recent British "Daily Mail," some countries' people live just as miserably as the British. The burden on British workers is increasing, but the interests of British industrialists and bankers are also soaring. Compared with 1948 and 1946-47, profits have already increased by 32 percent.

　　In France, within the Marshall Plan, the vast majority of products remain restricted. In the past year alone, the price of bread has increased by 46 percent, meat has increased by 19 percent, potatoes and sugar have increased by 35 percent, milk has increased by 70 percent, butter has increased by 122 percent, soap has increased by 97 percent, and old clothes have risen to more than three and a half times their original expensive price. Public business is similarly soaring. The price of coal has increased by 82 percent, gasoline has increased by 87 percent, electricity has increased by 143 percent, and water has increased by 100 percent.

　　In Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, and other countries within the Marshall Plan, the prices of bread and other foods are also rising. Compared with the cost of living in Italy in 1938 and last year, it has increased more than fifty times. However, the poverty and misfortune of the people cannot stop the capitalists from extracting massive profits.

　　This is the capitalist law of man eating man.

　　In the People's Democratic countries that have taken the socialist path, a different scene has emerged. In Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Albania, the people of these countries are working hard to engage in great construction and increase production. The living standards of the working people are improving due to falling prices and rising wages.

　　In Poland, bread, flour, and wood have been restored to pre-war prices, and real wages have increased by 10 percent compared with pre-war levels. In Romania, food prices were reduced by 20 to 40 percent last October, and the prices of clothing, old clothes, and other industrial products were reduced by 20 to 50 percent. The wages of the working people in Czechoslovakia have increased by more than 40 percent compared with pre-war levels.

　　The People's Democratic countries are moving forward along the road of socialist construction, and they are advancing in great strides with the strength of a seven-alliance united!

　　The Soviet people are marking "May Day" with their new creative labor endeavors. Every department of the Soviet state is pouring out a pleasant message -- the people are reporting to their leader Comrade Stalin about their final victory. These reports are made with their production figures and new vows, production figures and new vows produced a new Soviet shining character -- the new socialist society person's individual interests and social interests are consistent -- in the Soviet Union workers have long been freed from slavery and exploitation, laboring for the entire country has become a source of happiness.

　　伟大的真理

    在社会主义的社会里劳动是最光荣的最高尚的，生产的浪漫主义被苏联人民建设的努力热情的鼓舞着前进，在苏联的国家里男女每天产生着新的劳动成果，创造了财富来增长社会主义国家的力量和提高着劳动人民的物质与文化水平。
    苏联每一个公民对于他的未来是有信心的，国家的财富是为了他自己的，每个人是为了他自己而工作，每个人就是他自己命运的主人。
    在资本主义的国家里有着极相反的真实的情况，在这些国家里每天给劳动人民带来的是新的贫困和灾难。
    让我转向于具体的事实和数字来说，这些事实和数字表示了生活的动力是胜过语言的雄辩的。
    仅在过去的三年中，在苏联有四○○○个国家企业有的已经恢复，有的已经重建完毕，在这三年中大批的劳动者从事于国家经济建设已经增加了二、○○○、○○○人，苏联人民是不知道失业的意义的，如果你走过了莫斯科的街道或其他苏联的城市你可以看到无数招收工作人员的广告，如工程师、工艺家、熟练工人、会计员、教员、医生、电报工作者、店员、管理火炉的人员、货车管理人员、电力熔接人员、专门技师等。
    另一方面在资本主义的国家里劳动人民永远是一种失业恐怖的自由，谁也不知道明天的工作变动，今天他还可以过着可怜的生活，但是明天的工作他的资本家老板是否需要他是没有保证的。
    在美国有三、○○○、○○○人是失业的，将近一○、○○○、○○○人仅仅有一部分时间从业，在英国约有一、○○○、○○○人没有工作，在意大利有二、五○○、○○○人，在西德超过了一、○○○、○○○人，比利时有三○○、○○○人，在希腊已经超过了三○○、○○○人，假设把亚洲的非洲的和拉丁美洲的殖民地和附属国里的失业人数也计算在内，这支失业的军队要接近十亿人了，这许多人过着一种不幸的生活，他们靠着赈济和吃着被弃掉在菜桶里的食物的残屑生活着。
    苏联房屋的建设正在迅速的进行着，在一个市镇的家庭里每一秒钟都在建设着房屋，相邻的集体农场的家庭也得到了自己的新房子，上次的战争固然使乡村遭受了严重的损害，全苏联的人民在很少几年内将有广阔的幸福的住所。
    同时在资本主义的国家里，例如在美国，整个领土没有遭受到一个敌人的子弹的射击，也没有一所建筑物因了战争被损坏，可是成千万的人民却睡在大街上和公园里，全美国的房子建筑有百分之二十是简陋的，但有三分之一的人口住在里面，同时在美国的城市里有很多空着的房子，如果能够付出租金倒是很舒适的家庭，可是对于一般普通人来说，租金是太高了。
    三年以前斯大林同志说：“新五年计划的基本工作在于恢复被战争破坏的国家区域，在工业和农业方面要恢复到战前的水平，然后才是超过或少于这个水平的本质的度量。”
    苏联人民已经担负起这些工作，食料和消费品在质量上的增加已经使劳动人民有益于生活标准本质上的提高，苏联政府在很久以前已经废除了粮食的限制，作为群众用的消费品正在稳定的复原到国家重订的价格，单就去年苏联的人口从重订的价格中得到约八六、○○○、○○○、○○○卢布的利益。
    重订的价格在今年的三月一日又重新订了一次，如面包、肉类、鱼类、牛奶油、纸烟、衣料、旧衣服和其他的食品已经降低了百分之十到百分之三十的价格，价格的低廉使苏联人民的购买力另外增加了七一、○○○、○○○、○○○卢布。
    在资本主义的国家里商店和仓库里放着大批的食品，但成千万的穿破衣服的、穿破鞋子的、饥饿的、无家可归的人民却不能购买最必要的生活必需品。
    就美国的食品价格来说，在过去的三年中增加了百分之五十四，从战争结束后衣服的价格已上涨了百分之三十六，煤和木柴涨了百分之二十三，家俱涨了百分之四十，家庭用品涨了百分之二十，然而财政大王们和工业大王们在一九四八年的赢利是二一、○○○、○○○、○○○美元，对于一九四七年的赢利一七、四○○、○○○、○○○美元来说是超过了，一方面是资本家的垄断企业的利润的高涨，另一方面是劳动人民的生活水平的下降。
    在英国的油类、肉类、棉织品、以及大批别的重要的物品仍然被限制着，同时食物的价格和工业品的价格仍然在增长着，仅仅去年平均价格的增涨总计是百分之九，而衣料的价格已涨了百分之十六，旧衣服已涨了百分之二十八。
    据英国最近的“每日邮报”说，有一些国家的人民和英国是同样的可怜的生活着，英国劳动者的负担正在增长着，可是英国的工业家和银行家的利益也正飞跃的上升着，拿一九四八年同一九四六——四七年来比较已经增加了百分之三十二的利润。
    在马歇尔计划内的法国绝大部分的生产品仍然被限制着，就去年来说面包的价格增加了百分之四十六，肉类增加了百分之十九，马铃薯和糖增加了百分之三十五，牛奶增加了百分之七十，奶油增加了百分之一二二，肥皂增加了百分之九十七，旧衣服涨了比三倍半还多的昂贵的价格，公家的营业同样的飞跃的上涨，煤的价格增加了百分之八十二，气油增加了百分之八十七，电增加了百分之一四三，水增加了百分之一百。
    在意大利、比利时、荷兰，和其他马歇尔计划内的国家面包及其他食料的价格也正在上涨着，以意大利一九三八年的生活费和去年来比较增加了五十倍以上，但是，人民的穷困和不幸是不能够阻止资本家们大量榨取利润的。
    这就是人吃人的资本主义的规律。
    在人民民主的国家里已经采取了社会主义的道路，就出现了不同的景象，在保加利亚、匈牙利、波兰、捷克斯拉伐克，和阿尔巴尼亚这许多国家的人民正在为了从事伟大的建设和增加生产而努力，劳动人民的生活水准由于物价下降和工资的增加正在改善着。
    在波兰面包、面粉、和木料已经复原到战前的价格，而真实的工资同战前的水准来比较已经增加了百分之十，罗马尼亚在去年十月食品的价格已降低了百分之二十到百分之四十，衣料、旧衣服和其他工业品的价格降低了百分之二十到百分之五十，捷克斯拉伐克劳动人民的工资比战前的水平增加了百分之四十多。
    人民民主国家正沿着建设着的社会主义的道路前进，他们团结了七个联盟的力量大步的前进着！
    苏联人民用他们新的创造的劳动事业来标记着“五一”，苏联国家的每一个部门正倾吐着一个令人愉快的消息——人民正在报告给他们的领袖斯大林同志关于他们最后的胜利，这些报告是用他们的生产数字和新的誓言的，生产数字与新的誓言产生了新的苏联人的闪耀的品格——新社会主义社会的人是个人的利益和社会的利益一致的——在苏联劳动者早已从奴隶与剥削中解放出来，为了整个国家而劳动已经变成一个幸福的源泉了。
