　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 5th: TASS, New York—The U.S. Department of Commerce admits that the number of unemployed in the United States increased again in October. U.S. Secretary of Commerce Sawyer, in a conversation with reporters, stated: According to the Bureau of the Census, the number of fully unemployed increased by 225,000 last month, nearly two million more than in October of last year (the number of unemployed in October 1948 was 1,642,000). Although these figures reflect the surge in unemployment in the United States to a certain extent, they are clearly underestimates. Many American economists say that the Bureau of the Census underestimates the unemployment figures. The United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America, affiliated with the Congress of Industrial Organizations, believes that the number of fully unemployed people in the United States is actually over five million.

　　美国完全失业人数上月又增二十二万
  　全部人数在五百万人以上
    【新华社北京五日电】塔斯社纽约讯：美国商务部承认，十月份美国失业人数再度增加。美国商务部长沙逸在与报界谈话时称：根据人口调查局统计，完全失业的人数在上月份增加了二十二万五千人，较去年十月份增加了近二百万人（一九四八年十月份失业人数为一百六十四万二千人）。虽然这些数字在一定程度上反映了美国失业人数的激增，但它们显然是过低的估计。美国许多经济学家说，人口调查局过低估计了失业的数字。产业工会联合会所属电气、无线电及机器工人工会认为，美国完全失业的人数，实际上在五百万人以上。
