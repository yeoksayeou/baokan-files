　　Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, November 5th: People's organizations and democratic parties in Nanjing have enthusiastically responded to the solemn statement issued by the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party on October 30th, protesting the barbaric persecution of people's leaders in the United States, Australia, and Greece by the reactionary governments of these three countries. The Preparatory Committee of the Nanjing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, representing 100,000 workers in the city, issued a written statement saying: We firmly protest the shameless actions of the reactionary governments of the United States, Australia, and Greece in persecuting the people's leaders of these countries. We unite with the democratic and progressive forces of the world to respond to the reactionary crimes of the reactionary governments of the United States, Australia, and Greece with a resolute anti-imperialist struggle. Organizations such as the Nanjing Municipal Student Union, the Democratic Women's Federation, the Democratic Youth Federation, and the Nanjing Branch of the China Association for Science also submitted written protests, unanimously supporting the statement of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. The protest letters stated: The American people and our interests are the same. The reactionary government of the United States persecutes the freedom of the American people, which is the same as persecuting our freedom. We express our solemn protest against this act of provocation against the peace-loving and democratic people of the world. People from various democratic parties also expressed great indignation at the criminal acts of the reactionary governments of the three countries. Shao Hengqiu, representative of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang, said: The so-called "freedom" in the United States is only the freedom of a few big capitalists, and the broad working people have no freedom. The Chinese people resolutely oppose this evil verdict of American imperialism. Ouyang Zhiwu, representative of the China Democratic League, and Chen Jiming, representative of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, also delivered speeches successively, expressing their unanimous support for the statement of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and believing that it represents the common opinion of the broad masses of the Chinese people.
    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 5th: Situ Meitang, a democratic figure among overseas Chinese in the United States, recently issued a written statement protesting the crimes of the reactionary governments of the United States, Australia, and Greece in persecuting revolutionary leaders in those countries and provoking the peace and democracy camp. The statement said: I oppose these dark trials. The revolutionary leaders of the American Communist Party, the Australian Communist Party, and Greece are dedicated to the struggle for the liberation and happiness of all mankind. They are not guilty. Those who are guilty are the Wall Street financial groups who reveal their Nazi faces from behind the mask of false democracy. The guilty judging the innocent—how bizarre, how shameful! You must quickly overturn your verdicts and restore the freedom of the revolutionaries. The statement also protested the recent acts of hooligans in the United States destroying the venue of the San Francisco Overseas Chinese celebration of the founding of the new China and the violence of American residents in Shenyang, such as Wald, in beating Chinese workers.

    【新华社南京五日电】南京市各人民团体、各民主党派热烈响应中共中央十月三十日为抗议美国、澳大利亚、希腊三国反动政府对三国人民领袖实行野蛮迫害一事所发表的严正声明。南京市总工会筹委会代表全市十万工人发表书面声明称：我们坚决抗议美、澳、希反动政府迫害该国人民领袖的无耻行动。我们联合世界民主进步的力量，以坚决的反帝斗争来回答美、澳、希反动政府的反动罪行。南京市学生联合会，民主妇女联合会，民主青年联合会和中国科学协会南京分会等团体，也纷纷提出书面抗议，一致拥护中共中央的声明。抗议书中说：美国人民和我们的利害相同，美反动政府迫害美国人民的自由，也就如同迫害我们的自由一样。对这种向全世界和平民主人民挑衅的行为，我们表示严正的抗议。各民主党派人士对三国反动政府的犯罪行为也都表示非常激愤，国民党革命委员会代表邵恒秋说：美国的所谓“自由”，只是少数大资本家的自由，广大的劳动人民是没有自由的。中国人民坚决反对美帝国主义这一罪恶判决。民主同盟代表欧阳执无、农工民主党代表陈继明均先后发表谈话，表示一致拥护中共中央的声明，并认为这是代表中国广大人民共同的意见。
    【新华社北京五日电】美国华侨民主人士司徒美堂顷发表书面声明，抗议美、澳、希反动政府迫害各该国革命领袖和向和平民主阵营挑衅的罪行。该声明称：我反对这些黑暗的审判。美共、澳共及希腊的革命领袖们为全人类的解放幸福而献身斗争，他们没有罪，有罪的是那些从假民主脸幕后露出纳粹面孔的华尔街财阀们。有罪者审判无罪者，这是多么离奇，多么可耻！你们得赶快取消你们的审判，恢复革命者的自由。该声明并对最近美国流氓捣毁旧金山华侨庆祝新中国成立会会场及沈阳美侨瓦尔德等殴伤中国工人的暴行表示抗议。
