Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 23rd - The full text of the speech by Nie Rongzhen, Mayor of Beijing, at the Beijing People's Conference celebrating the success of the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference is as follows:
    Comrades!
    The Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference under the direct leadership of the World Federation of Trade Unions has been successfully held. Today, we, the people of Beijing, are holding a meeting to celebrate the success of this conference. We, the people of the capital of the People's Republic of China, feel greatly honored to see such an important international conference with great historical significance held here. This conference will make great contributions to the liberation movement of the oppressed nations in Asia and Australia, to the revolutionary unity of the working class in the two continents, and to the cause of defending world lasting peace and people's democracy.
    We, the people of Beijing and the people of all of China, have achieved the basic victory of the People's Liberation War and the People's Great Revolution, and we are about to win complete victory in the whole country. What lies before us is even greater and more arduous construction work. We are more urgently in need of continuing to consolidate domestic democratic unity, and we are also more urgently in need of uniting international friends, learning from the advanced experience of the working class and people of all countries in construction, and obtaining the help of international friends to better build our people's country and people's capital.
    Celebrate the success of the World Federation of Trade Unions Executive Bureau and the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference!
    Long live the liberation of the oppressed nations of Asia and Australia!
    Long live the unity of the working class in Asia and Australia!
    Unite international friends, learn from international experience, and build a new China!
    Workers of all countries, unite! Defend world lasting peace and people's democracy!
    Long live the victory of Marxism-Leninism!
    Long live Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese working class and people!
    Long live Marshal Stalin, the greatest teacher of the proletariat and progressive people of the world!
