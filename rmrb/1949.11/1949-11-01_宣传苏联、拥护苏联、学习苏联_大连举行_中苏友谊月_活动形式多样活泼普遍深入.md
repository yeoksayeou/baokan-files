Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 30th - Dalian City's "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month," which began in mid-August and ended in mid-September, achieved remarkable results in propagandizing the Soviet Union, supporting the Soviet Union, and learning from the Soviet Union. Enterprises, factories, schools, organs, and organizations have all carried out education in support of and learning from the Soviet Union through reports and get-togethers. The city held 348 large and small reports in one month, with 120,000 people listening to the reports. The forums conducted in conjunction with the reports were more widespread and in-depth. Enterprises and schools held forums in groups, and districts held forums in neighborhoods. According to incomplete statistics, more than 1,800 forums were held, with more than 130,000 participants. In addition, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association held 125 celebration parties and get-togethers. At these meetings, various Chinese and Soviet cultural and entertainment programs were generally performed. Eleven branches of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, including the Municipal Government and the Lushun-Dalian Administrative Office's Department of Commerce, held Soviet photo exhibitions, which were visited by more than 23,000 people. The Sino-Soviet Cinema screened seven famous Soviet films during the Friendship Month, with more than 6,000 viewers. The Dalian Sino-Soviet Friendship Association held six joint parties, forums, and Soviet musicians' concerts for Chinese and Soviet cadres, two of which were forums for Chinese and Soviet literary and art workers, which had good results in promoting the unity of literary and art workers from the two countries and exchanging experiences. Large enterprises and factories held eight Sino-Soviet employee joint picnics, with a total of more than 8,700 participants. The picnics took various forms. For example, more than 700 Chinese and Soviet personnel from the Dalian Shipyard held a sea picnic, and more than 2,000 people from the Dalian Railway Bureau held a train picnic. Other forms included bicycle picnics and harbor picnics, and the participants were very enthusiastic. In the pleasant and lively picnics, Chinese and Soviet employees sang, danced, and talked freely, fully demonstrating the harmonious atmosphere of a big family. The feelings between Chinese and Soviet personnel became more cordial. To cooperate with the Friendship Month's propaganda activities, many factories and schools published wall newspapers and blackboard newspapers. The city had 92 blackboard newspapers, and the Yuwang (Fishing Net) General Factory alone had 18 wall newspapers. Most employees actively wrote articles. At the same time, many units also launched campaigns to write letters of thanks. One unit in the harbor wrote more than 1,100 letters.
