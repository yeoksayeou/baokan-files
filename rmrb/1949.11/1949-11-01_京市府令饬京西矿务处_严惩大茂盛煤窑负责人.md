　　Beijing Municipal Government Orders Beijing West Mining Bureau to Severely Punish Responsible Persons of Da Maosheng Coal Mine
    [Beijing News] Following the Min Sheng Coal Mine, the privately-owned Da Maosheng Coal Mine in Mentougou has again experienced a roof collapse incident, resulting in the death of workers. The Finance Committee of the Beijing Municipal People's Government attaches great importance to this and has ordered the Beijing West Mining Bureau to not only provide generous compensation and treatment to the dead and injured workers, but also to severely punish the mine owner and related personnel. At the same time, it pointed out that the Beijing West Mining Bureau should bear part of the responsibility for the repeated unfortunate incidents. In the future, it must thoroughly and carefully inspect the equipment and mining methods of each mine. All facilities that violate laws and endanger the safety and health of workers must be corrected in a timely manner to ensure that similar unfortunate accidents do not occur again in the future.
