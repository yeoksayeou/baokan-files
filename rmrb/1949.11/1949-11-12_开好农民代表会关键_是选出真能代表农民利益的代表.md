The key to the decision to hold successful farmer representative meetings lies in electing representatives who can truly represent the interests of farmers well. The methods of selecting representatives vary from place to place, depending on factors such as the length of time the area has been liberated, the strength of the work foundation, and the level of farmers' awareness. For example, in key working districts and villages in Huangpi and Wuchang counties, most have gone through the struggle against wealthy and oppressive landlords who concealed land during the summer grain requisition, and farmers have a considerable level of class consciousness and have established farmers' associations. These areas elect representatives based on the farmers' associations. However, sufficient deliberation and education must be carried out before the election to make the vast majority of farmers realize that the election of representatives is closely related to their own interests, to ensure the purity of the representatives elected. In newly liberated areas where there is no work foundation, representatives are generally first designated from among farmers with pure class backgrounds based on the information known to cadres, and then mass meetings are held for the masses to examine and approve them. However, in all regions, the election of representatives must fully mobilize farmers to participate in discussions. For example, the fourth district of Wuchang did not mobilize farmers for discussion before convening the farmer representative meeting and relied on the old Baojia heads to "find" representatives, resulting in most of the representatives "found" being elements of wealthy and oppressive landlords, and the farmer representative meeting in the district completely failed. In addition, during the election of representatives, it is necessary to be vigilant against the conspiracies and sabotage activities of landlords and local bullies, and it is necessary to clearly state the attitude of the people's government in supporting the farmers, so that the farmers dare to participate.

According to the experience of various regions, the following issues should be paid attention to when using farmer representative meetings to carry out various tasks:

I. In the farmer representative meeting, it is necessary to inspire activists to make typical complaints about their suffering and carry out more in-depth class education; at the same time, in addition to carrying out policy education, it is also necessary to carry out current affairs education to break through the ideological concerns of some representatives.

II. To make the representative meeting truly effective, it is necessary to establish the prestige of the representatives among the masses in a step-by-step manner. It is best to make the issues discussed at the representative meeting into resolutions, and after being adopted by the government, promulgate these resolutions by decree, stipulating that everyone (including cadres) should abide by them. At the same time, stipulate and organize representatives to convey and assist in the implementation of these resolutions among the farmers. This will have a great effect on encouraging and supporting the farmers' courage to struggle and combating saboteurs, and at the same time, it can supervise cadres and cultivate the democratic style of cadres. For example, a district worker in Hanyang County was privately shielding landlords and not implementing the resolution, and was reported by the representatives to the district government. After the first district of Wuchang held a farmer representative meeting, the representatives returned to their villages to personally preside over mass meetings to convey the resolutions. When representatives encountered difficulties in their work, the cadres provided specific help, and as a result, the work in the district was rapidly launched, and more than 20,000 mu of black land were found in ten days. After the fourth district of Huangpi County held a farmer representative meeting, more than 500 representatives conveyed the resolutions to every village in two days. When the masses saw that the speakers were all their own people and that they were doing their own things, they responded one after another. Cadres in some areas only used representatives to "run errands" and did not give play to the active role of the representatives in the work. The representatives had no prestige among the masses and could not play a role in the work.

III. Using farmer representative meetings to control the old Baojia heads is a very important link in the autumn grain requisition work in the new districts. The key villages in the Huarong, Fankou, and Yanji districts of Echeng County summoned the old Baojia heads to the meeting at the end of the farmer representative meeting and announced the resolutions of the farmer representative meeting to the old Baojia heads, asking them to implement these resolutions to make meritorious service to the people and atone for their sins. Some representatives also accused the old Baojia heads of their crimes to their faces. Under the pressure of the masses, the old Baojia heads bowed their heads one after another and reported a total of 1,040 mu of concealed land.

IV. Although all regions have now paid attention to carrying out work through farmer representative meetings, cadres in some places still have a simple "completion of tasks" view of farmer representative meetings, or do not know how to use them to promote work, so it is not easy for representatives to maintain their work enthusiasm. This situation urgently needs to be corrected.

V. Pay attention to the composition of the representatives. The vast majority of district or township representative meetings in Wuchang, Huangpi, Mianyang, and Huanggang counties are all farmers, and no rural handicraftsmen or revolutionary intellectuals participate. Among the 71 representatives of the Yuekou District Farmer Representative Meeting in Tianmen County, almost all were poor peasants and hired farmhands, and middle peasants accounted for a very small number, which narrowed the representativeness of the representative meeting. This phenomenon is worth paying attention to and improving.

    开好农民代表会关键
    是选出真能代表农民利益的代表
    开好农民代表会的决定关键，在于选出真能代表农民利益好的代表。各地代表产生的方式，因该地解放时间的长短，工作基础的强弱，农民觉悟程度的高低等条件而有所不同。如黄陂、武昌等县重点工作的区村，大部经过了夏征工作中的反恶霸地主瞒田的斗争，农民有相当的阶级觉悟，并有了农会组织，这种地区即以农会为基础选举代表。但在选举前还须经过充分的酝酿和教育，使广大农民认识选举代表与自己的利害息息相关，以保证被选代表成份的纯洁。在刚解放的新区，由于工作没有基础，一般是根据干部所了解的情况，先指定成份纯洁的农民为代表，再召开群众大会，由群众审查通过。但不论在何种地区，代表的选举都须充分发动农民进行讨论。如武昌第四区在召开农民代表会前既未曾发动农民讨论，并依靠旧保甲长“找”代表，结果“找”出来的代表大部是恶霸地主分子，该区的农民代表会因而完全失败。此外，在选举代表时，还必须警惕地主恶霸的阴谋及破坏活动，必须明确表明人民政府为农民撑腰的态度，使农民敢于参加。
    根据各地经验，运用农民代表会进行各种工作时，要注意下面几个问题：
    一、在农民代表会中，要启发积极分子作典型诉苦，进行比较深入的阶级教育；同时除进行政策教育外，还须进行时事教育，以打破某些代表的思想顾虑。
    二、要使代表会真正起作用，必须有步骤地在群众中建立代表的威信。最好把代表会讨论的问题作成决议，经政府采纳后，以明令公布这些决议，规定任何人（包括干部）都应遵守。同时规定和组织代表在农民中传达并协助执行这些决议。这样对鼓舞和支持农民的斗争勇气和打击破坏分子都有很大作用，同时又可以监督干部，培养干部的民主作风。如汉阳县有一个区工作员私自包庇地主，不执行决议，即被代表们检举出来，向区政府告发。武昌一区开完农民代表会后，代表们回乡亲自主持群众大会，传达决议。代表在工作中发生困难时，干部即给以具体帮助，因而该区工作迅速展开，在十天中即查出黑田二万多亩。黄陂县第四区开农民代表会后，五百多代表在两天中即将决议传达到每个村。群众见到说话的都是自己人，办的都是自己的事，就纷纷响应。有些地区的干部只是利用代表“跑跑腿”，不去发挥代表们在工作中的积极作用，代表们在群众中既没有威信，对工作也就起不了作用。
    三、运用农民代表会控制旧保甲长，是新区秋征工作中极重要的环节。鄂城县的华容、樊口、燕矶等区的重点村，在农民代表会将结束时，召集旧保长到会，当面向旧保长宣布农民代表会的决议，要他们执行这些决议以向人民立功赎罪，有的代表并当面控诉了旧保长的罪行。在群众的压力下，旧保长纷纷低头，共报出瞒田一千零四十亩。
    四、现在各地虽已注意到经过农民代表会开展工作，但有些地方的干部，对农民代表会尚存在着单纯的“完成任务”观点，或不会运用它来推动工作，因而不易使代表经常保持其工作的积极性。这种情形亟待纠正。
    五、要注意代表成份。武昌、黄陂、沔阳、黄冈等县绝大多数区或乡的代表会全部代表都是农民，没有农村小手工业者及革命知识分子参加。天门县岳口区农代会七十一个代表中，几乎全是贫雇农，中农都占极少数，缩小了代表会的代表性。这种现象是值得注意改进的。
