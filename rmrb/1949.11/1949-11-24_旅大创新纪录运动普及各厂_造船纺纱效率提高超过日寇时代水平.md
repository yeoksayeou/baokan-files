Xinhua News Agency, Dalian, 23rd—The movement to create new production records in the Lüda area has been popularized in all light and heavy industrial factories. The Dalian Changchun Railway Bureau, which first launched this movement, in addition to creating new records such as shortening vehicle turnaround time by one and a half days in October, the steel casting shop of the railway factory recently improved the parts of the 15-ton crane and the melting technology, creating a new record of using two electric furnaces to melt nine tons of molten steel juice by 220 workers in one day. Due to the adoption of the Soviet mold shipbuilding method (i.e., using molds) and the improvement of workers' technical proficiency, the work efficiency of manufacturing a small electric boat hull at the Dalian Ship Repair and Shipbuilding Factory is now 70 times higher than during the Japanese occupation period under the same number of people and working conditions. In the Dalian Textile Factory's weaving workshop, workers Li Shirong, Qu Yanzeng, and others can watch eight ordinary looms each, and each loom averages 31 meters to 32.7 meters of cloth per day (eight hours), all or 98 percent of which is the best "Grade A cloth." Six workers in the Jinzhou Textile Factory have achieved 96.5 percent machine efficiency and created a new record of one person watching three fine spinning machines (spinning 24-count warp yarn), a total of 1,200 spindles; each person can produce 135 kilograms of yarn per day, which is twice the production level of the Japanese occupation era. The main reasons why this movement to create new records can be widely carried out in the Lüda area are: After studying and researching the documents of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and the Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government on carrying out mass movements to create new production records, the Lüda District Committee of the CPC and the Lüda Administrative Office made a decision to call on all factories to fully implement it; the CPC branches, administrative departments, trade unions, and Communist Youth League organizations in various factories responded to this call and, on the basis of past production and economy competitions and rationalization proposals, focused on the problems that each factory urgently needed to improve, mobilized outstanding workers with excellent production results to introduce their work experience, and inspired the enthusiasm and creativity of all workers and staff.

　　旅大创新纪录运动普及各厂
　　造船纺纱效率提高超过日寇时代水平
    【新华社大连二十三日电】旅大地区的创造生产新纪录运动，已普及到各轻重工业工厂中。首先开展这一运动的大连中长铁路局，除十月份已创造缩短车辆周转率达一天半等新纪录外，最近铁路工厂铸钢场又改进了十五吨吊车零件和熔化技术，创造了以二百二十个工人一天用两个电气炉熔化九吨钢汁的新纪录，大连修船造船工厂由于采用了苏联的胎造船法（即用模子）和工人技术熟练程度的提高，现在制造一条小电船船壳的工作效率，较日寇时期在同样的人数和工作条件下，提高了七十倍。大连纺织工厂织布场工人李士荣、曲言增等，每人能看八台普通织布机，每台每天（八小时）平均织布三十一公尺至三十二点七公尺，全部或百分之九十八为最好的“甲字布”。金州纺织工厂有六名工人发挥机器效能达百分之九十六点五，并创造了一个人看三台精纺机（纺二十四支经纱），共一千二百枚纱锭的新纪录；每人每天能产纱一百三十五公斤，较日寇时代的生产水平提高了两倍。这一创造新纪录运动所以能在旅大地区普遍开展的主要原因是：中共旅大区党委和旅大行政公署在学习与研究了中共中央东北局和东北人民政府工业部关于开展群众性创造生产新纪录运动的文件后，即作出决定号召各工厂全力贯彻执行；各工厂的中共支部、行政、工会、青年团纷纷响应这个号召，并在过去生产节约竞赛，合理化建议等运动的基础上，针对各工厂本身急需改进的问题，发动各生产成绩优良的工人介绍工作经验，启发了全体工人，职员的积极性和创造精神。
