Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 21st:

　　Nai Yue, the head of the Siamese National Federation of Trade Unions delegation to the Asian-Australasian Trade Union Conference, reported on the Siamese workers' movement at the conference today. The summary is as follows:

　　In January 1949, the Siamese National Federation of Trade Unions joined the World Federation of Trade Unions, which was a great victory for the Siamese National Federation of Trade Unions and marked the beginning of a new stage in the Siamese workers' movement. Now, the Siamese National Federation of Trade Unions is carrying out the anti-imperialist national liberation movement and the struggle for democratic freedom with increasing confidence. At present, the US imperialists and their running dogs, the Luang Phibunsongkhram reactionary clique, have begun to persecute the Siamese National Federation of Trade Unions with new and brutal methods. They prevented the Siamese National Federation of Trade Unions from participating in the Second Congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions, but the Siamese working class firmly supports the resolutions of the Second Congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions and strives to realize them in their entirety.

　　Siam has a population of 18 million, and its abundant resources are all controlled by British and American monopoly capitalists. British and American imperialists collude with Siamese feudal elements to prevent the development of Siamese industry, making the Siamese people impoverished. The Siamese working class is therefore very small in number, totaling about 250,000 to 300,000 people, of which about 50,000 are in the timber industry, 30,000 in the rubber industry, and about 20,000 in tin mines. In addition, there are about 20,000 workers in small machine factories in Bangkok, the Siamese capital, and other large cities. The rest of the workers are mostly scattered in smaller factories. The Siamese working class has a special characteristic, namely that although it is small in number, 90,000 workers are serving as servants for capitalists, especially foreign capitalists. The Siamese working class is suffering immensely. They have no political rights, and their working hours are unlimited. In the tin mines, timber industries, and other sectors controlled by imperialists, workers have to work hard for 12 to 14 hours a day, and wages are very low. There are no labor protection facilities at all. For example, in tin mines, male and female workers work barefoot in water for 12 to 14 hours a day. They get rheumatism, and they have to work while sick. If workers become seriously ill and cannot work, they will be cruelly dismissed by the capitalists. They get no sick pay or compensation, and they can only die of illness or starvation. Siamese female workers and child laborers are very common, but female workers' wages are only half of those of male workers doing the same work. Child laborers' wages are generally only one-tenth of those of adult workers. British and American capitalists pay European workers twice as much as Siamese and Chinese workers for the same work. British and American imperialists and the Luang Phibunsongkhram gang use all kinds of methods to provoke national hatred and divide the working class. However, the greatly awakened Siamese working class has understood that the working class must unite regardless of nationality in order to achieve liberation.

　　Before the Pacific War, the Siamese working class had not organized due to the influence of national hatred provoked by imperialism. Since the Japanese imperialists occupied Southeast Asia, Siamese workers united in the name of mutual aid. They became the vanguard of the people's resistance against Japan and the mainstay of the united front against Japanese imperialism and the Luang Phibunsongkhram gang. In the course of the struggle, the workers' class consciousness was raised. In November 1944, the Bangkok Workers' Union was established to jointly combat the Japanese imperialists in a more organized way. After Japan surrendered in August 1945, the Siamese working class's anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggle moved from secret to open and unfolded more actively. On October 28, a large demonstration of 20,000 workers was held, smashing the war criminals' conspiracy to divide the working class. In November, the rice workers held another major strike and won, uniting Siamese and Chinese workers, basically destroying the remnants of feudal guildism, and educating the working class on how to strengthen its trade union organization.

　　On January 16, 1946, the Bangkok Workers' Union held its second congress, which passed the following resolutions: (1) To completely eradicate the remnants of fascist forces, and to severely punish war criminals, including confiscation of property and transfer of funds for allied debt repayment and compensation for victims. (2) To fight for genuine democracy, demanding that the government grant freedom of speech, publication, assembly, and strike, and the legal status of working-class political parties. (3) To improve workers' lives, first of all by relieving unemployed workers, enacting labor laws, and improving workers' treatment. (4) To establish a national trade union federation. (5) To join the World Federation of Trade Unions. Workers throughout Siam, following the example of the Bangkok area, established their own trade unions one after another. On April 28, 1946, the preparatory committee for the National Federation of Trade Unions was established. In April 1947, the National Federation of Trade Unions congress was convened, and the National Federation of Trade Unions was formally established.

　　Before the establishment of the National Federation of Trade Unions, Siamese workers had heroically launched 59 strikes. After its establishment, the number of strikes increased to 67. These strikes were carried out under extremely difficult conditions under the oppression of the authorities. For example, when the workers of the American-owned petroleum company went on strike, the Siamese reactionary rulers sent a large number of police to interfere, intimidate, and arrest workers' leaders. At the end of March 1948, @喃立容苏贪, the vice-chairman of the Bangkok Workers' Union, was imprisoned. The striking workers in Prachinburi Province and representatives of the National Federation of Trade Unions were also imprisoned. This series of events aroused great resistance from the workers and forced the Luang Phibunsongkhram gang to release the arrested personnel. The Siamese workers' struggle for freedom and against persecution played a great role in the Siamese workers' movement. Union membership has continued to increase, and currently 50,000 workers are organized in unions. The Siamese National Federation of Trade Unions and the Bangkok Workers' Union are continuing to strengthen and consolidate the trade union movement, raise workers' political awareness, and run cadre training classes, workers' night schools, and children's schools.

　　Siamese workers have waged a resolute struggle against the ruling class's attempts to divide the trade union movement. They know that the so-called "Labor League" established by the ruling class in April 1948 is a reactionary organization that follows the orders of British and American imperialists to suppress the Siamese democratic trade union movement. The leaders of the "Labor League" had participated in the divisive trade union conference held in Geneva in June 1949. It is no accident that it received special protection from the British Trades Union Congress and the American Federation of Labor. Although the Siamese reactionary authorities want to use this tool to undermine the Siamese workers' movement, the entire Siamese working class has organized and united around the National Federation of Trade Unions to fight to the end to defend the interests of the Siamese people. The reactionary elements will eventually be defeated.

　　报告暹罗职工运动
    【新华社北京二十一日电】暹罗全国总工会出席亚澳工会会议代表团团长乃越今天在亚澳工会会议上报告暹罗职工运动。摘要如下：
    一九四九年一月暹罗全国总工会加入了世界工联，这是暹罗全国总工会的大胜利，这是暹罗职工运动一个新阶段的开始。现在暹罗全国总工会正以日益增强的信心进行着反帝的民族解放运动和争取民主自由的斗争。目前美帝国主义及其走狗銮披汶反动集团开始以新的残暴手段来迫害暹罗全国总工会，他们阻止暹罗全国总工会参加世界工联第二届代表大会，但是暹罗工人阶级坚决拥护世界工联第二届代表大会的决议，并为其全部实现而努力。
    暹罗的人口有一千八百万，它的丰富物产全部操纵在英美独占资本家手里，英美帝国主义者勾结着暹罗封建分子，防止暹罗工业的发展，使得暹罗人民穷困不堪。暹罗工人阶级因此在数量上是很小的，它总共有二十五万到三十万人，其中在木材业者约有五万人，在橡胶业者三万人，在锡矿中约二万人。此外，暹罗京城曼谷和其他大城市里还有小机器工厂工人约二万人。其余的工人大都分散在更小的工厂里。暹罗工人阶级有一个特殊的性质，就是它为数虽少，但却有九万工人是替资本家尤其是外国资本家当仆役的。暹罗工人阶级是万分痛苦的，他们没有政治权利，他们的工作时间是没有限制的。在帝国主义的锡矿、木材业等部门，工人们每天要做十二小时至十四小时的苦工，工资又非常低廉，劳工保护设施一点也没有。比如在锡矿中男女工人每天赤着脚在水里工作了十二到十四小时，染上了风湿病，还得带病工作。如果工人们病势严重不能工作，就要被残忍的资本家开除，没有养病费和抚恤金，他们就只有病死、饿死。暹罗女工和童工是很普遍的，女工工资却只有同等工作的男工的一半。童工工资一般的只有成年工人的十分之一。英美资本家对于欧洲工人工资比同样工作的暹罗和中国工人要多给两倍。英美帝国主义者和銮披汶匪帮用尽种种方法挑拨民族仇恨，促使工人阶级分裂，然而大大觉悟了的暹罗工人阶级已明白了工人阶级必须不分国籍地团结起来，才能获得解放。
    太平洋战争以前，暹罗工人阶级由于受着帝国主义所挑拨的民族仇恨的影响，一直没有组织起来；自从日本帝国主义者占领东南亚以后，暹罗工人们才以互助的名义团结起来了，他们成为人民抗日的先锋，成为反抗日本帝国主义和銮披汶匪帮的进步力量联合阵线的中坚。在斗争过程中，工人们的阶级意识提高了，在一九四四年十一月成立了工会——曼谷各业工人联合会，更有组织地共同打击日本帝国主义者。一九四五年八月日本投降以后，暹罗工人阶级反帝反封建的斗争由秘密走到公开，更积极地展开了。十月二十八日举行了二万工人的大示威，粉碎了战争罪犯们的分裂工人阶级的阴谋；十一月米业工人又举行一次大罢工，获得了胜利，使暹罗籍和中国籍工人团结一致，在基本上摧毁了封建残余的行会主义，并教育了工人阶级怎样加强其工会的组织。
    一九四六年一月十六日，曼谷各业工人联合会召开第二次代表大会，通过了下列决议：（一）彻底铲除法西斯残余势力，对于战犯们应予以严厉的处罚，包括财产充公，移作同盟国的赔债费和对受难人民的抚恤费。（二）为争取真正民主而斗争，要求政府给予言论，出版、集会、罢工的自由和工人阶级的政党的合法地位。（三）改善工人生活，首先是救济失业工人，颁布劳工法和改善工人待遇。（四）成立全国工会联合会。（五）加入世界工联。暹罗全国的工人，仿效曼谷区的榜样，纷纷成立自己的工会，到了一九四六年四月二十八日成立了全国总工会筹备委员会，一九四七年四月召开了全国总工会代表大会，正式成立了全国工会联合总会。
    在全国工会联合会成立之前，暹罗工人曾英勇地举行了五十九起罢工；在成立以后，罢工增至六十七起。这些罢工都是在当局压迫下的极艰苦情况下进行的。例如在美商煤油公司工人罢工时暹罗反动统治者就曾派大批警察干涉，恐吓并逮捕工人领袖。一九四八年三月底曼谷工联副主席＠喃立容苏贪被关入了牢狱，北柳府罢工的工人和全国总工会的代表都遭到了监禁，这一连串事件，激起了工人们的大反抗，迫使銮披汶匪帮释放了被捕人员。暹罗工人们争取自由反对迫害的战斗，对于暹罗工人运动起了很大的作用，工会会员不断增加，目前已有五万工人组织在工会里了。暹罗全国总工会和曼谷工联正在继续加强巩固工会运动，提高工人政治觉悟，举办干部训练班、工人夜校和儿童学校。
    暹罗工人对于统治阶级阴谋分裂职工运动的企图进行了坚决的斗争，他们知道一九四八年四月由统治阶级所建立的所谓“劳动联盟”，是在于遵照英美帝国主义者的命令来镇压暹罗的民主职工运动的反动组织。“劳动联盟”的领袖们曾经参加过一九四九年六月在日内瓦召开的分裂工会会议，它之所以得到英国职工会大会和美国产联的特别保护，不是偶然的。虽然暹罗反动当局想利用这个工具来破坏暹罗的工人运动，然而全暹罗工人阶级已经组织起来了，团结在全国总工会周围，为保卫暹罗人民的利益而奋斗到底，反动分子终会得到失败的结果。
