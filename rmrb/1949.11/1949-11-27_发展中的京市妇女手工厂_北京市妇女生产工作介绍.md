Developing Beijing Women's Handicraft Factory
Introduction to Beijing Women's Production Work
Bai Sheng

The Beijing Women's Handicraft Factory was an institution of "relief" before liberation. It was neither a factory nor a school. Most of the workers here were out-of-school girls aged fifteen to nineteen. Their families were mostly clerks, rickshaw pullers, and workers. Under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, they could only get a meal of coarse grains at the factory every day, and they didn't get any wages. Several dozen workers shared one weaving machine, and they couldn't learn any skills. Among the one hundred and eighty-six female workers, only one-tenth had some skills. Under such circumstances, a backward thinking of some female workers was cultivated: how to find a lover after graduation. They even didn't want others to call them female workers, but preferred to be called female students. The Kuomintang did not add machines or raw materials to this factory, nor did they repair the broken machines. In name, the factory was divided into seven departments: weaving towels, socks, embroidery, horizontal knitting, Western clothes, Chinese clothes, and hand weaving. In reality, only one or two machines could be started regularly.

After the liberation of Beijing, the People's Government took over this factory and handed it over to the Beijing Women's Federation for direct leadership. Since the Women's Federation took over in February, it decided to transform and rectify it, gradually turning it into a truly productive and enterprise-based women's factory. After this policy was determined, the Women's Federation first borrowed 250,000 yuan from the People's Bank to buy raw materials and repair machines, and started to work. At the same time, it also began planned preliminary ideological education work for the workers in the factory, mobilizing the female workers ideologically, so that they could recognize the erroneous views of relying on relief and belittling labor in the past, and the bad vanity brought to them by the old society. Make the factory go from the nature of relief to self-sufficiency.

After more than two months of rectification and education work, the female workers' thinking began to gradually change, and they realized the importance of labor and production. In order to strengthen management, the factory was reorganized from seven departments into three departments (socks, towels, Western clothes). In June, the People's Government borrowed another one million yuan, on the one hand to maintain the lives of the workers, and on the other hand to add machines and let the workers learn skills. The entire June and July were a period when workers enthusiastically launched technical learning and political learning. In mid-July, the factory officially announced the plan to implement full self-sufficiency in August.

Due to the change in the nature of the factory, the workers' political consciousness and technical level have been improved, and the enthusiasm for production has also been unprecedentedly high. When they received their wages for the first time in mid-August, every female worker's heart was filled with excitement and joy. They no longer rely on shameful relief, but have become glorious laborers and producers.

However, in August, the production situation of the factory appeared relatively chaotic because the work plans of various departments were not well coordinated and the machines in each department were not running consistently. However, they also gained a lot of experience and lessons in the actual production process. They have realized the importance of formulating and establishing work plans and work systems for each department for the production of the entire factory.

Now the socks department averages 27 machines running every day, and each person can produce two dozen socks per day. The towel department can produce three dozen towels per day per person, and the Western clothing department can complete one and a half sets of cotton clothes per person. At present, each department has launched a production competition, and everyone has set their own monthly production plan, reported and discussed it publicly, and then the leadership will conduct inspections. Workers can generally abide by labor discipline, strive to complete production tasks, and improve product quality. And in order to increase production, some people also automatically work overtime. At present, most of the female workers in the towel department and socks department have exceeded the production plan. Recently, because the factory wants to add electrical machinery production, many female workers have enthusiastically requested to learn electrical machinery.

The factory has now established a preparatory committee for the trade union and the Youth League, all female workers have joined the trade union, and twenty-eight female workers have been approved to join the Youth League.

At present, there are more than 120 female workers, 17 staff members, and about 200 people can be employed with those who sew socks and temporary male workers. The factory currently has 36 sewing machines, 20 towel weaving machines, and 45 sock weaving machines. Recently, 20 electric motors will be purchased and transported from Shanghai. This is a factory that has the hope of doing a good job in women's production. It is believed that under the leadership of the Women's Federation and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, it will develop into a model women's factory. (Attached pictures)

　　发展中的京市妇女手工厂
  　北京市妇女生产工作介绍
    柏生
    北京市妇女手工厂，解放前是一个“救济”性质的机构。既非工厂，也非学校。在这里工作的多半是十五岁到十九岁的失学的女孩子。她们的家庭成份都是小职员、三轮车夫、工人。在国民党反动派的统治下，她们除了每天能到厂里去吃一顿粗粮外，是得不到什么工资的。几十个工人共一个织机，也学不到什么技术。一百八十六个女工中，稍有技术的仅占十分之一。在这样情形下，养成了一部分女工的落后思想：混到毕业后如何找爱人。甚至不愿别人称她们为女工，而愿称为女学生。国民党对这个工厂，既不添置机器、原料、也不修理坏了的机器，名义上工厂里是分织毛巾、袜子、刺绣、横机、西服、中服、手织七部，实际上经常能开动的机器只有一两部。
    北京解放后，人民政府接管了这个工厂，便把它交给北京市妇联直接领导。妇联从二月接管以来，即决定改造整顿，逐渐把它变成一个真正能够生产的企业化的妇女工厂。这个方针确定后，妇联首先向人民银行贷款二十五万元买原料，修机器，着手进行开工。同时对厂内工人更开始有计划的初步思想教育工作，从思想上动员女工们，使她们认识过去依赖救济和轻视劳动的错误观点，和旧社会所带给她们的不好的虚荣心。使工厂由救济性质的走向自给的。
    经过两个多月的整顿教育工作，女工们的思想开始逐渐转变，认识到劳动与生产的重要。为了加强管理，工厂由七部改组成三部（袜子、毛巾、西服）。六月份，人民政府更借了一百万元，一方面给工人维持生活，一方面添置机器，让工人学习技术。整个六、七两个月是工人热烈展开技术学习和政治学习的时期。七月中旬，工厂即正式宣布八月份实行全部自足自给的计划。
    由于工厂性质的改变，工人政治觉悟与技术的提高，生产情绪也空前高涨。当八月中她们第一次领到工资的时候，每个女工的心里都充满了兴奋与愉快。她们已不再依靠可耻的救济，而成为了一个光荣的劳动者和生产者。
    但八月份因各部门工作计划还未能很好的配合，各部机器开动的不一致，工厂的生产情况显得比较混乱。但是她们在实际的生产过程中也得到了不少的经验教训。她们已经认识到制定和建立各部门的工作计划与工作制度对于整个工厂生产的重要性。
    现在袜子部平均每天开动二十七台机器，每人每日可出两打袜子，毛巾部每天每人可出三打毛巾，西服部每人可完成一套半棉衣。目前每部都展开了生产竞赛，每人都订出自己每月的生产计划，自报公议，再由领导进行检查。工人们一般都能遵守劳动纪律，努力完成生产任务，提高产品质量。并且为了增加生产，有的人还自动加班。目前毛巾部、袜子部女工大多数都超过了生产计划。最近因厂内要添设电机生产，许多女工们都热烈要求着学习电机。
    厂内现已成立了工会筹委会和青年团等组织，全部女工已加入了工会，有二十八个女工被批准加入了青年团。
    目前全厂共有一百二十余位女工，十七个职员，连同缝袜口的，和临时的男工，约可解决将近二百人的生活。厂内现有缝纫机三十六台、织毛巾机二十部、织袜机四十五部，最近并将由上海购运电机二十台。这是一个有希望搞好妇女生产的工厂，相信在妇联及市总工会的领导下，她将发展成一个模范的妇女工厂。（附图片）
