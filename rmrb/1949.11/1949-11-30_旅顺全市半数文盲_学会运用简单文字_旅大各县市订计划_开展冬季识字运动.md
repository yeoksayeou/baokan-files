　　Lushun City Has Half of Its Population Illiterate - Learning to Use Simple Writing
    Dalian Counties and Cities Formulate Plans - Launching a Winter Literacy Campaign
    [This newspaper reports] Dalian News: The literacy campaign in the Dalian area for the past ten months has achieved preliminary results, laying a favorable foundation for the task of basically eliminating illiteracy in 1950, and is now preparing to launch a large-scale winter literacy campaign. In Lushun City, 92% of illiterate people aged 14 to 55 have participated in learning (out of 47,310 illiterate people in the city, 43,923 have enrolled); the city has completed the task of "one literacy school per village"; after ten months of learning, these workers, farmers, fishermen, and citizens who originally did not know a single character have on average 57% learned to use simple writing (writing letters, keeping accounts, writing wall newspapers, issuing notes, etc.). Dalian County mobilized more than 35,000 people to participate in literacy learning this year, of which 24,813 were illiterate, accounting for 84% of the county's young and middle-aged illiterate population. Among these enrolled illiterate people, 27% can recognize more than 400 characters, and 55% can recognize more than 200 characters.
    In January of this year, the CPC Dalian District Committee and the Dalian Administrative Office proposed launching a literacy campaign, planning to eliminate illiteracy in the city within two years. Each city and county formed literacy committees at all levels, and cadres in most areas conducted in-depth publicity, mobilized the masses to enroll through cultural grievance sessions, and helped the masses solve difficulties (for example, in Majia Village, Jin County, 20 old ladies took turns taking care of children for women who enrolled, and the enrolled women exchanged labor with them by sewing and making shoes), and the students were in high spirits; in order to overcome procrastination, the students in Jin County stipulated that they would enter the school with the ringing of a bell and strictly observe the time. The literacy schools also carried out mutual assistance competitions, visited each other, and used methods such as those who knew more characters helping those who knew fewer; recently, Dalian County and Jin County have held commendation conferences for model students, commending outstanding students and teachers, which has greatly helped the development of the literacy campaign. Some excellent teachers are conscientious and responsible, attend classes on time, select teaching materials and methods based on the opinions of the masses, and are extremely welcomed by the students. At present, the literacy campaign in some areas has not been very effective, mainly because the cadres do not go deep into specific leadership and only listen to reports; they do not pay attention to ideological mobilization of the students and forcibly enroll them by coercive orders, resulting in their not being at ease in learning. In addition, the mobility of students in urban areas is very high, which affects learning and remains to be solved.
    [Northeast News] The rural areas of Dalian cities and counties have successively formulated plans to widely launch a winter literacy campaign. Lushun City decided to designate the period from November 20th to March 20th of next year (a total of four months) as the winter study movement period, with two hours of class time per day. The learning progress is determined as follows: excluding the Spring Festival, New Year, and Sundays, there are still 90 days of learning time. It is required that the elementary level recognizes four characters per day, totaling 360 characters; the intermediate level recognizes five characters per day, totaling 450 characters; and the advanced level recognizes six characters per day, totaling 540 characters. Each district and village must also mobilize all illiterate people who have not participated in learning to participate in learning by means of persuasion and mobilization, and strictly prohibit coercive orders; the daily attendance rate is required to reach 90%. It is also emphasized that through the winter study movement, the existing illiterate people who know less than 100 characters will be completely eliminated. The specific requirements are: those who know 100 to 200 characters should generally know more than 500 characters, those who know 300 to 400 characters should generally know more than 700 characters, those who know 500 to 600 characters should generally know more than 900 characters, those who know 700 to 800 characters should generally know more than 1,100 characters, and those who know more than 900 characters should be able to read books and newspapers and understand general scientific knowledge. In order to achieve the above requirements, district and village cadres are called upon to lead by example, specifically help solve difficult problems, earnestly study, utilize and create various effective mobilization methods, and launch the winter study movement; illiterate people should launch a "mutual teaching and mutual learning" movement, implement the principle of "unifying learning and application," and carry out the "three more" movement of reading more, writing more, and using more. Teachers should correct illiterate people's notes once every three days, prepare lessons collectively once every three days, and achieve the degree of not missing classes, not teaching wrong, and not speaking nonsense. Dalian County proposed to launch a literacy competition in the winter study movement, encouraging illiterate people who know less than 400 characters to strive to complete the task of eliminating illiteracy one year in advance. Mobilize all young and middle-aged illiterate people to enroll; the attendance rate should reach more than 85%. It is also required that the village branch play a leading role in mobilizing party members in the winter study movement. In order to strengthen the leadership of the winter literacy movement, it is determined that the village cultural and educational committee should hold a meeting every seven days, and the teachers should hold a joint meeting every three days. County and district-level leaders should pay attention to cultivating typical examples and grasping inspection work during the winter study. The Jin County Cultural and Educational Committee also made a draft plan for launching the winter study movement, emphasizing that the cultural and educational committees of each district and village should strengthen leadership, improve and equip cultural club cadres, strengthen communication between the upper and lower levels, strictly implement reporting, inspection, and examination systems to ensure the completion of learning tasks.

　　旅顺全市半数文盲  学会运用简单文字
    旅大各县市订计划  开展冬季识字运动
    【本报讯】旅大消息：旅大地区今年十个月来的识字运动已获初步成绩，为一九五○年基本上消灭文盲的任务打下了有利基础，现正准备大规模的转入冬季识字运动。旅顺市全市十四岁到五十五岁的文盲已有百分之九十二参加学习（全市文盲四七三一○人，入学的达四三九二三人）；全市完成了“一村一个识字学校”的任务；这些原来一字不识的工人、农民、渔民和市民，经过十个月学习后，平均已有百分之五十七学会了运用简单文字（写信、记账、写壁报、开条子等）。大连县今年动员群众三万五千余人参加识字学习，其中文盲达二万四千八百一十三人，占全县青壮年文盲的百分之八十四。这些入学文盲，已有百分之二十七识四百字以上，百分之五十五识二百字以上。
    今年一月，中共旅大区党委和旅大行署提出开展识字运动，计划两年内消灭全市文盲。各市、县即组成各级识字委员会，大部地区干部深入宣传，通过文化诉苦的形式发动群众入学，并帮助群众解决困难（如金县马家村组织二十个老太太轮流给入学妇女看小孩，入学妇女则以缝补做鞋等与她们换工），学员们学习情绪很高；金县学员为了克服拖拉作风，大家规定敲钟入学，严守时间。各识字学校并开展了互助竞赛，互相参观，识字多的带动识字少的等办法；最近大连县、金县都举行了奖励模范大会，表扬优秀的学员与教师，大大帮助了识字运动的开展。一些优秀的教师，认真负责，按时上课，本着群众的意见选择教材与教学方法，极为学员所欢迎。目前有一部分地区识字运动成绩还不显著，主要由于干部不深入具体领导，只听汇报；对学员不注意思想动员，以强迫命令方式强拉入学，结果不安心学习。此外，市区内学员的流动性很大，影响学习，尚待解决。
    【东北讯】旅大各市县农村，纷纷订出计划，要广泛的开展冬季识字运动。旅顺市决定自十一月二十日至明年三月二十日（共四个月）为冬学运动期，每日授课时间两小时，学习进度决定：除春节、新年、星期日放假外，尚有九十天的学习时间，要求初级每天识四个字，计三百六十个字；中级每天识五个字，计四百五十个字；高级每天识六个字，计五百四十个字。各区村并要将现有未参加学习的文盲，利用说服动员等方式全部动员参加学习，严禁强迫命令；每日出席率要求达到百分之九十。并强调通过冬学运动，彻底消灭现有识一百字以内的文盲。其具体要求：识一百字至二百字的普遍要识到五百字以上，识三百字至四百字的普遍要识到七百字以上，识五百字至六百字的普遍要识到九百字以上，七百字至八百字的普遍要识到一千一百字以上，九百字以上者要达到会看书看报，能懂得一般的科学知识。为达到上述要求，号召区村干部要以身作则，具体帮助解决困难问题，切实研究，利用和创造各种有效动员办法，把冬学运动开展起来；文盲要展开“互教互学”运动，贯彻“学用一致”的原则，开展多看，多写，多用的“三多”运动。教师每三天给文盲批改笔记一次，每三天集体备课一次，要做到不误课，不教错，不乱讲的程度。大连县提出在开展冬学运动中开展识字比赛运动，鼓励识四百字以下的文盲争取提前一年完成消灭文盲的任务。动员全部青壮年文盲入学；出席率要达到百分之八十五以上。并要求村支部在冬学运动中动员党员起带头作用。为加强冬季识字运动的领导，确定村文教委员会每七天应召开一次会议，教师每三天召开一次联席会。县、区级领导在冬学中要注意培养典型和抓紧检查工作。金县文教委员会也作出开展冬学运动的计划草案，强调各区、村文教委员会在冬学运动中要加强领导，健全和配备文化俱乐部干部，加强上下联系，严格报告检查考试等制度，以保证完成学习任务。
