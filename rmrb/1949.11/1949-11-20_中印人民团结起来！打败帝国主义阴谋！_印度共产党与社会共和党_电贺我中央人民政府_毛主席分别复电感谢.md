　　Chinese and Indian People Unite! Defeat Imperialist Conspiracies!
    The Communist Party of India and the Socialist Republican Party
    Congratulate Our Central People's Government
  　Chairman Mao Sends Reply of Thanks Respectively
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 19th] B.T. Ranadive, General Secretary of the Communist Party of India, sent a telegram to Chairman Mao Zedong on October 12th, congratulating him on the establishment of the Central People's Government of China. The telegram reads as follows:

Dear Comrade Mao Zedong:

On behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of India, I extend to you and through you to the Chinese people the warmest congratulations on the establishment of the People's Government of China. The establishment of the People's Government marks the final victory of the Chinese people over their enemies and enslavers - the American imperialists and the Kuomintang reactionaries. This great and historic victory signifies the demise of foreign imperialism and its agents in all countries on the Asian continent, and opens up the prospect of the imminent liberation of the people of all Asian countries. It changes the balance of power in the world and constitutes a decisive turning point in the worldwide struggle for peace, democracy and socialism. In liberating themselves, the Chinese people have inflicted a decisive defeat on the common enemy of the people of all countries, American imperialism, and have promoted the cause of world liberation.

The working masses of India are overjoyed by this great victory. They know that this victory accelerates their own liberation. This victory inspires them to fight more resolutely and bravely to end the current regime and establish a people's democratic rule.

I would like to assure you and through you the Chinese people that the Nehru government, which pursues a policy hostile to the Chinese people and continues to recognize the bankrupt Kuomintang government, does not represent the wishes and will of the Indian people. The vast majority of the Indian people support friendship and cooperation with the great Chinese people. On the other hand, the Nehru government follows the orders of the Anglo-American imperialists, who want to build India into a reactionary fortress against China. Under the cover provided by the Nehru government, the Anglo-American imperialists are carrying out their heinous conspiracies in Nepal and Tibet. In this way, the Nehru government is directly playing the role of accomplice to the enemies of the Chinese people.

I would like to assure you and through you the Chinese people that the Communist Party of India will expose all conspiracies against the Chinese people that the Nehru government may be planning under the orders of American imperialism, and will unite the people to defeat these conspiracies.

The Central Committee of our party has asked me to extend our respect and congratulations to Comrade Zhu De and the personnel of the Chinese People's Liberation Army who, with their rapid military victories, have overthrown all imperialist plans. The great military art of Comrade Zhu De and his comrades-in-arms, and the heroism and self-sacrificing spirit of the personnel of the People's Liberation Army, have terrified the American advisors of the Kuomintang and shattered all hope of prolonged resistance by the Kuomintang forces.

On the occasion of this historically significant and world-shaking victory, the Central Committee of our party cheers for the great Chinese Communist Party and its leader Mao Zedong. The victory achieved by the Chinese Communist Party is the victory of Marxism-Leninism, the victory of the great Stalinist line. The Chinese Communist Party and its great leader Mao Zedong have once again demonstrated the invincible power of Marxism-Leninism.

Finally, Comrade Mao Zedong, on the occasion of your election as Chairman of the People's Republic of China, I extend my congratulations to you.

Long live Comrade Mao Zedong!

Long live the Chinese Communist Party!

Long live the militant unity of the Chinese and Indian people!

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　General Secretary of the Communist Party of India B.T. Ranadive
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　October 12, 1949

[Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 19th] Chairman Mao Zedong of the Chinese Communist Party replied to the congratulatory message from B.T. Ranadive, General Secretary of the Communist Party of India. The telegram reads as follows:

Dear Comrade Ranadive:

I have received your congratulatory telegram of October 12th and thank you very much for your enthusiastic congratulations to the People's Republic of China and the Chinese Communist Party. All the Chinese people will feel happy and proud when they read in your telegram the fraternal love of the revolutionary people of India. The Indian people are one of the great nations in Asia with a long history and a large population, and its past destiny and future path have many similarities with China. I am convinced that, relying on the brave Communist Party of India and the united struggle of all Indian patriots, India will not remain under the shackles of imperialism and its collaborators for long. A free India will one day appear in the world as a member of the socialist and people's democratic family, just like a free China, and that day will end the era of imperialism and reaction in human history. I wish the patriotic people of India victory in their united struggle! Long live the fraternal unity of the Indian and Chinese people!

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Chairman of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party Mao Zedong
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　November 19, 1949

[Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 19th] Chairman Mao Zedong today replied to the congratulatory message from the leader of the Socialist Republican Party of India, Sarat Chandra Bose. Sarat Chandra Bose sent a telegram to Chairman Mao Zedong in October, which reads:

To Chairman Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, Beijing:

On the occasion of your unanimous election as Chairman, I extend my most sincere congratulations to you and the Chinese people on behalf of myself and the Socialist Republican Party, as well as the progressive forces and national newspapers throughout the country. I predicted in September 1945 that Chiang Kai-shek would soon fall and you would take power as the leader of China, which makes me feel happy today. I hope that you will consolidate the diplomatic and other relations between China and India to counter the conspiracies of Western imperialism and free all Asian countries from foreign shackles.

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Sarat Chandra Bose, 1 Woodburn Garden, Calcutta

Chairman Mao's reply reads as follows:

Mr. Sarat Chandra Bose:

Thank you for your congratulations to the People's Republic of China. The Chinese people welcome the establishment of broad friendship with the Indian people and all oppressed nations to jointly oppose imperialist aggression.

　　中印人民团结起来！打败帝国主义阴谋！
    印度共产党与社会共和党
    电贺我中央人民政府
  　毛主席分别复电感谢
    【新华社北京十九日电】印度共产党总书记Ｂ·Ｔ·兰那地夫于十月十二日致电毛泽东主席，祝贺中国中央人民政府的成立，电文如下：亲爱的毛泽东同志：
    我谨代表印度共产党中央委员会，向你并且经由你向中国人民最热烈地祝贺中国人民政府的成立。人民政府的成立，标志着中国人民对敌人与中国奴役者——美帝国主义者与国民党反动分子的最后胜利。这一伟大的、有历史意义的胜利，意味着外国帝国主义及其在各国的代理人在亚洲大陆上的灭亡，并打开了亚洲各国人民即将解放的前景。它改变了全世界力量的对比，并且构成了全世界争取和平、民主与社会主义的斗争中的一个决定性的转折点。中国人民在使自己解放中，使世界各国人民的公敌——美帝国主义遭到了决定性的败北，并促进了世界解放事业。
    印度的劳苦群众，为这一伟大的胜利而感到欢欣。他们知道这一胜利加速了他们自己的解放。这一胜利鼓舞他们更坚决、更勇敢地进行斗争，以结束现政权和建立人民民主的统治。
    我愿向你并经由你向中国人民保证：奉行敌视中国人民的政策而且仍然继续承认破产了的国民党政府的尼赫鲁政府，并不代表印度人民的愿望和意志。绝大多数的印度人民拥护对伟大的中国人民的友谊与合作。另一方面，尼赫鲁政府却奉行英美帝国主义者的命令，他们要把印度建设成为反对中国的反动堡垒。英美帝国主义者在尼赫鲁政府提供的掩护下，在尼泊尔与西藏进行其万恶的阴谋。这样一来，尼赫鲁政府便正在直接为中国人民的敌人的阴谋为虎作伥。
    我愿向你并经由你向中国人民保证：印度共产党将揭穿尼赫鲁政府在美帝国主义命令之下可能策划的这一切反对中国人民的阴谋，并将团结人民将这些阴谋打败。
    我党中央委员会请我向朱德同志及以其迅速的军事胜利推翻了一切帝国主义计划的中国人民解放军人员，转致敬意与贺忱。朱德同志及其战友的伟大军事艺术和人民解放军人员英勇无畏与自我牺牲的精神，使国民党的美国顾问惊惶失措，并粉碎了国民党力量的长期抵抗的一切希望。
    我党中央委员会值此有历史意义的与震撼世界的胜利之际，为伟大的中国共产党及其领袖毛泽东而欢呼。中国共产党所取得的胜利是马列主义的胜利，是伟大的斯大林主义路线的胜利。中国共产党及其伟大的领袖毛泽东已再度表明了马列主义不可征服的力量。
    毛泽东同志，最后，兹值你当选中华人民共和国主席之际，我谨向你祝贺。
    毛泽东同志万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    中国人民与印度人民的战斗团结万岁！
    　　　　　　　　　　　　印度共产党总书记Ｂ·Ｔ·兰那地夫
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　一九四九年十月十二日
    【新华社北京十九日电】中国共产党毛泽东主席电复印度共产党总书记兰那地夫的祝贺。电文如下：亲爱的兰那地夫同志：
    你在十月十二日的贺电收到了，十分感谢你对于中华人民共和国和中国共产党的热情的祝贺。全中国人民读到你的电报里所表现的印度革命人民的兄弟友爱，都将感觉欢欣和骄傲。印度人民是亚洲历史悠久人口众多的伟大民族之一，它的过去的命运和将来的道路和中国有许多类似之点。我确信，依靠勇敢的印度共产党和一切印度爱国者团结奋斗，印度决不会长期处于帝国主义及其合作者的绊羁之下。自由的印度将有一天要与自由的中国一样，作为社会主义和人民民主主义大家庭的一员而出现于世界，这一天将要终结人类历史上帝国主义和反动的时代。祝印度爱国人民团结奋斗的胜利！印度人民和中国人民的兄弟团结万岁！
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　中国共产党中央委员会主席毛泽东
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　一九四九年十一月十九日
    【新华社北京十九日电】毛泽东主席本日电复印度社会共和党领袖萨拉·博斯的祝贺。按萨拉·博斯曾于十月间电贺毛泽东主席称：北京中华人民共和国中央人民政府主席毛泽东：
    当你被一致选举为主席之际，谨代表我自己和社会共和党以及全国进步力量和民族报向你及中国人民致最真诚的祝贺。我在一九四五年九月就曾预言蒋介石不久就会倒台，你将当政为中国的领袖，这使我今天感到欣快。我希望你将巩固中国与印度之间外交的和其他的关系，以对付西方帝国主义的阴谋，并使一切亚洲国家解脱外国的枷锁。
    　　　　　　　　　　萨拉·博斯　加尔各答伍德伯恩花园一号
    毛主席的复电如下：萨拉·博斯先生：
    感谢你对于中华人民共和国的祝贺。中国人民欢迎与印度人民和一切被压迫民族建立广泛的友谊，以共同反对帝国主义的侵略。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　  　　　　　　　　　毛泽东
