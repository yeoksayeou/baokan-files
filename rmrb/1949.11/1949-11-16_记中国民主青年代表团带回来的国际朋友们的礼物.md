　　A Record of Gifts Brought Back by the Chinese Democratic Youth Delegation from International Friends
　　The Chinese Democratic Youth Delegation has gloriously returned from Budapest, the capital of Hungary. They brought back the great spirit of internationalism, and also brought back nearly a thousand precious gifts. From these precious gifts, we can see the love and care of the people of all countries for Chairman Mao and our Chinese people!
　　The most eye-catching among the gifts are more than twenty bronze statues, sculptures, and portraits of leaders of people from all over the world. These include statues of leaders such as Lenin, Stalin, Dimitrov, and Rakosi. Secondly, there are various kinds of pennants presented by delegations from various countries, and displays engraved with the national emblem of Poland and the emblem of the Hungarian Youth People's Union. There are also Romanian national costumes and large silver cups as high as two feet. There are exquisite models of generators, sawmills, coal trucks, gliders, and tractors. There are commemorative albums, radios, telescopes, wine, bread, biscuits, embroidered shoes, and even children's toys such as dolls and small leather balls, which are truly countless!
　　Some of the gifts were specially sent by people's leaders and people from various countries to Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and Deputy Commander-in-Chief Peng. Once, Comrade Xiao Hua, the head of the Chinese Democratic Youth Delegation, went to see Comrade Rakosi, the Prime Minister of Hungary. Comrade Rakosi kindly inquired about the health of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and what kind of entertainment they liked in their spare time. When he heard that Chairman Mao could still drink and Commander-in-Chief Zhu liked hunting, he specially sent the finest wine and two shotguns to Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and Deputy Commander-in-Chief Peng as gifts. The shotguns were also engraved with the names of Commander-in-Chief Zhu and Deputy Commander-in-Chief Peng. The representative of Democratic Greece gave the emblem of the Greek Youth League to Chairman Mao, and the emblem of the Youth League and the military emblem of the Greek People's Army to Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and said in the dedication: The Greek people will always stand with the Chinese people led by Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and fight the imperialism and its running dogs to the end!
　　The Soviet Union's gift was simple but profound. When the delegation passed through Moscow on its way back home, the Central Committee of the Soviet Lenin Communist Youth League gave the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League 10,000 books, including Marxist-Leninist theoretical works on economics, culture, and youth work, and a summary of the rich experience of the Soviet Union in various aspects of the 32 years since its founding. This is of great help to our country's ongoing great construction work. The Soviet Union is caring for us like an elder brother. At the grand and warm welcome meeting at the Soviet Lov Station, the Soviet Young Pioneer children took off their beautiful silk and satin red scarves and personally tied them around the necks of our representatives. When our delegation visited the "Children's Cultural Center" in the Baoman District of Moscow, the children handed over their own paintings, handicrafts, and wooden Russian blocks for literacy to our representatives, asking them to bring these back to the Chinese children.
　　New democratic countries in Eastern Europe also presented us with a large number of gifts: Czechoslovakia gave us a relief of Stalin's statue, a radio, and a clock; Romania gave us Romanian national costumes, and Poland gave us displays of the Polish national emblem, etc.
　　In Budapest, French miners held a reception to report on the process and experience of the French miners' struggle against the US imperialist Marshall Plan and their own reactionary government over the past year, and gave the miners' lamps used by coal miners in the mine to our representatives, asking them to transfer them to Chinese coal miners.
　　The gift from the Italian delegation to China was a red "Peace Flag" with the Italian word "Peace" embroidered on it. Last year and this year, Italian workers and farmers in northern Italy held strikes against the Marshall Plan, against new war conspiracies, and for peace, and were suppressed by their own reactionary government. They launched a "Peace Flag" movement. At that time, almost every household hung this "Peace Flag." This flag was once even placed on the Foreign Ministry building of the reactionary government. At the conference in Budapest, the Italian representative gave this glorious flag to the Chinese people as a souvenir.
　　The Vietnamese delegation gave us a portrait of the Vietnamese people's leader Ho Chi Minh and many handkerchiefs, on which were printed a map of Vietnam and the slogan "Stop the war against Vietnam."
　　Indonesian representatives gave us many Indonesian national emblems as souvenirs.
　　India is our neighbor. During the meeting, the Indian youth representatives saved their meal expenses and bought many flowers to make a plaque with the words "Salute to the victorious Chinese youth" written on it, along with two color cartoons. One depicts the situation of farmers in the Bengal region of India, under the leadership of the Communist Party, carrying out rent and interest reduction campaigns and gaining preliminary liberation, planting rice and harvesting crops. The other depicts the scene of guerrillas in the first liberated area of Deccan in India fighting bravely with the enemy.
　　This conference was held in Hungary. The enthusiasm of the Hungarian people will always remain in the hearts of the people of all countries. A large number of workers, farmers, youth league members, young pioneers, students, children, and old women traveled from dozens or even hundreds of miles away to Budapest with gifts. Hundreds and thousands of Hungarian people welcomed our representatives at every station. During the break of the conference, even late at night, groups of Hungarians shouted slogans of "Mao Zedong! Mao Zedong!" to congratulate and give gifts at our representatives' residences. After the conference, representatives from various countries went to Hungarian towns, villages, factories, farms, and schools to visit. Many gifts were given by the Hungarian people under these circumstances. The gift from the coal miners was a fist-sized model of a coal truck, carved from coal; the workers at the power plant gave the delegation models of motors and transformers; the gift from the workers at the sawmill was a half-foot-high sawmill; the gift from the workers at the machine factory was a beautiful four- or five-inch lathe; the gift from the workers at the cigarette factory was a half-foot square cigarette case, filled with cigarettes they made by themselves in a glowing metal five-pointed star frame, with a lighter and a cigarette dish attached; in addition, there were models of gliders, tractors, trams, and other gifts. The farmers brought apples from their orchards, bread they baked themselves, including a large bread in the shape of a five-pointed star, three feet in diameter, as well as homemade wine, homemade pickled pork, fresh pork, porcelain, bronze statues, embroidered shoes made by women, children's favorite toys such as dolls, small leather balls, and doll clothes.
　　When we see these precious gifts, we cannot help but think of our international friends far away in all parts of the world; their friendship and love for our leaders and people.

　　记中国民主青年代表团带回来的国际朋友们的礼物
    中国民主青年代表团光荣地由匈牙利首都布达佩斯回来了。他们带回来伟大的国际主义精神，也带来了近千件珍贵的礼物，从这些珍贵的礼物中，可以看出各国人民对毛主席和我们中国人民的热爱和关怀！
    礼物里面最引人注目的是二十多件世界各国人民领袖的铜像，塑像和画像。其中包括列宁、斯大林、季米特洛夫、拉科西等领袖的像。其次有各国代表团赠送的各式各样的锦旗，和刻有波兰国徽，匈牙利青年人民联合会会徽的陈列品。还有罗马尼亚的民族服，有高达二尺的大银杯。有发电机、锯木机、运煤车、滑翔机、拖拉机的精巧模型。有纪念册、收音机、望远镜、酒、面包、饼干、绣花鞋，甚至小孩的玩具如洋娃娃、小皮球等，真是数也数不清！
    礼物里面有一部分是各国人民领袖和人民特意送给毛主席、朱总司令和彭副总司令的。有一次中国民主青年代表团团长萧华同志去见匈牙利总理拉科西同志，拉科西同志很亲切地询问毛主席和朱总司令的健康和在工作之余喜欢什么娱乐。当他听到毛主席还能喝酒，朱总司令喜欢打猎的时候，他就特地派人送来了最精美的葡萄酒和两枝猎枪，送给毛主席朱总司令和彭副总司令作为礼品。猎枪上还刻着朱总司令和彭副总司令的名字。民主希腊的代表把希腊青年团的徽章，送给毛主席，把青年团的徽章和希腊人民军队的军徽送给朱总司令，并且在献词中说：希腊人民永远和毛主席朱总司令领导的中国人民站在一起，向帝国主义和它的走狗战斗到底！
    苏联的礼物是简单而意义深长的。代表回国路过莫斯科的时候，苏联列宁共产主义青年团中央委员会送给中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会一万册书，包括马列主义的来在经济、文化和青年工作理论著作和苏联建国卅二年各方面的丰富经验的总结。这对我国正在展开的伟大建设工作，有很大的帮助，苏联正象一位兄长一样的关怀着我们，在苏联罗夫车站盛大热烈的欢迎会上，苏联少年先锋队的小朋友们把他们漂亮的绸质和缎质的红领巾解下来亲自系在我们代表的脖子上。当我们的代表团在莫斯科保满区“儿童文化之家”参观的时候，小朋友们把他们自己画的图画，自己作的手工和识字用的木质俄文方块字交给我们的代表，要他们把这些带回来送给中国的小朋友们。
    东欧新民主主义国家也赠送给我们大批礼物：捷克送给了我们斯大林像的浮雕、无线电收音机和钟；罗马尼亚送给了我们罗马尼亚的民族服，波兰赠送的是波兰国徽的陈列品等。
    在布达佩斯，法国矿工们举办了一次招待会，报告一年来法国矿工反对美帝国主义马歇尔计划和本国反动政府斗争的经过和经验，并且把煤矿工人在矿坑中用的矿灯送给我们的代表，要他们转送给中国的煤矿工人。
    意大利代表团送给中国的礼物是一面红色的“和平之旗”，上面绣有意大利文“和平”二字。去年和今年，意大利工人和意大利北部的农民，曾经举行了反对马歇尔计划，反对新战争阴谋争取和平的罢工运动，受到本国反动政府的镇压，他们展开了一个“和平之旗”运动，当时差不多家家户户都挂上了这面“和平之旗”，这面旗帜有一次还曾经插上反动政府的外交部大楼。在布达佩斯的大会上，意大利的代表把这面光荣的旗帜送给中国人民作为纪念。
    越南代表团送给我们的礼物有越南人民领袖胡志明同志的像和许多手绢，手绢上印有越南的地图和“停止对越南的战争”的口号。
    印度尼西亚代表们送给我们许多印尼的国徽作为纪念。
    印度是我们的邻居，印度青年代表在开会期间节省饭费买了许多鲜花，做了一个匾，上面写着“向胜利的中国青年致敬”，连同两幅彩色的漫画送给我们。一幅是描写印度孟加尔地方的农民，在共产党领导下进行减租减息运动，获得了初步解放，在进行插秧和收割的情形。另一幅描写印度第一个解放区德南干那地方的游击队和敌人英勇作战的场面。
    这次大会是在匈牙利举行的。匈牙利人民的热情将永远存留在各国人民的心中，大批的工人、农民、青年团员、少先队员、学生、儿童、老太婆从几十里甚至几百里之外带着礼物赶到布达佩斯来，我们的代表每到一个车站就有成百成千的匈牙利人民来欢迎。我们代表的住所在休会期间甚至到深夜，还有成群的匈牙利人喊着“毛泽东！毛泽东！”的口号前来祝贺和送礼品。开完大会以后，各国代表到匈牙利的城镇、乡村、工厂、农庄、学校去参观和访问。许许多多的礼物是在这种情况下由匈牙利人民赠送的。运煤工人的礼物是个拳头大小的运煤车模型，是用煤块凿成的；发电厂的工人送给了代表团电动机和变压器的模型；锯木厂工人的礼物是个半尺高的锯木机；机器厂工人的礼物是个漂亮的四五寸大小的车床；香烟工厂工人的礼物是个半尺见方的烟盒，发光的金属五角星架中放满他们亲手制造的香烟，并且附有自来火和烟盘；此外还有滑翔机、拖拉机、电车的模型等礼物。农民们带来自己果园出的苹果，自己烘制的面包，其中有一个大面包，是五角星形状的，直径有三尺，还有自己酿制的葡萄酒、家制的腌猪肉、新鲜猪肉、瓷器、铜像，妇女们作的绣花鞋，儿童们心爱的玩具洋娃娃、小皮球、洋娃娃的衣裳等。
    当我们看见这些珍贵的礼物的时候，我们不尽想起远在世界各地的国际友人们；他们对我们的领袖和人民的友情和热爱。
