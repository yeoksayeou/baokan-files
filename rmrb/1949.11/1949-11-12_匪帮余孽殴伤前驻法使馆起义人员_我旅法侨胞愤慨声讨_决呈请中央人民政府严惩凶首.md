Xinhua News Agency, Prague, November 11th: Paris dispatch: Duan Maolan, the Kuomintang bandit gang's chargé d'affaires in France, colluded with French police to prevent former Kuomintang diplomats who supported the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China from entering the embassy; and instigated Kuomintang secret agents to assault embassy staff, an incident that has aroused public outrage among progressive overseas Chinese in France.

On the morning of the 3rd of this month, when the nine staff members who had declared their allegiance went to the embassy as usual to perform their duties, they found the embassy gate tightly closed, guarded by plainclothes police inside and patrolled by uniformed police outside. They waited a long time before entering the embassy. They questioned Duan Maolan about why he colluded with foreign armed forces to obstruct them from carrying out Minister Zhou's order from the Central People's Government to remain at their posts. Duan, the bandit, feeling guilty, falsely claimed that "the police were sent by the French government" and promised to hold a meeting at the embassy the next day to listen to the opinions of the overseas Chinese.

At 3 p.m. on the 4th, more than 60 overseas Chinese from Parisian industrial, commercial, and academic circles gathered at the embassy upon hearing the news. At this time, the Kuomintang bandit gang's special agents and ruffians, who had been gathered in advance, numbered more than 20 and, seeing the situation was not in their favor, did not dare to attend. The overseas Chinese present unanimously opposed Duan Maolan's collusion with French police and believed that the nine staff members who had declared their allegiance had the freedom to enter and leave the embassy and consulates. Under the pressure of public sentiment, Duan ordered Chen Xiongfei, the new pseudo-counselor dispatched to France by the Kuomintang bandit gang, to sign on his behalf, agreeing to comply. After Duan signed and agreed to comply, the overseas Chinese then elected workers' representative Wang Ziqing, business representative Chen Zhuolin, and academic representative Yang Chengzong to supervise the implementation and to serve as liaison persons for the overseas Chinese community. However, after the overseas Chinese dispersed at 6 p.m., Si Songxi, the pseudo-first secretary and special agent head newly transferred from the Netherlands by Duan, led a large number of Kuomintang special agents and ruffians to break in and beat the nine staff members who had declared their allegiance. Ling Qihan, Meng Juru, Wang Sicheng, Guan Junshi, and Gong Bingcheng were all seriously injured and have been sent to the hospital.

After this incident, the overseas Chinese were filled with indignation. On the 6th, they held a meeting at the Chinese Student Association to decide to express their condolences to the injured personnel and petition the Central People's Government to severely punish the masterminds. At the same time, they resolved to strengthen their own organization and call upon overseas Chinese in all countries to jointly condemn the remnants of the Kuomintang bandit gang.

    匪帮余孽殴伤前驻法使馆起义人员
    我旅法侨胞愤慨声讨
    决呈请中央人民政府严惩凶首
    【新华社布拉格十一日电】巴黎讯：在法国的国民党匪帮代办段茂澜，勾结法国警察，阻止拥护中华人民共和国中央人民政府的前国民党外交人员进入使馆；并纵使国民党特务殴伤馆员的事件，已引起旅法进步侨胞的公愤。
    本月三日晨，当九起义的馆员照常到馆执行职务时，见馆门紧闭，内有便衣警察把守，外有正规警察巡逻。他们等了好久，才进入使馆。他们质问段茂澜何以勾引外国武装，阻挠他们执行中央人民政府周部长坚守岗位的命令。段匪作贼心虚，乃诡称：“警察系法政府派来的”，并答应于次日在馆开会听取华侨的意见。
    四日下午三时，巴黎工商学界侨胞六十余人闻讯齐集大使馆。此时，国民党匪帮预先纠集的特务流氓二十余人见势不佳，未敢列席。到场侨胞一致反对段茂澜勾结法警，并认为九位起义人员有自由出入使领两馆的权利。在群情压力下，段乃令新由国民党匪帮派到法国的伪参事陈雄飞代表他签字承认照办。侨胞在段签字照办后复推出工人代表王子卿、商界代表陈卓林、学界代表杨承宗监视执行，并为各界侨胞的联络人。但当侨胞于六时散会后，段新从荷兰调来的伪一等秘书特务头子斯颂熙即率大批国民党特务流氓闯入，殴打九位起义人员，凌其翰、孟鞠如、王思澄，管君石、龚秉承均受重伤，已被送入医院。
    此事发生后，侨胞不胜义愤，于六日假中国学生会址开会，决定慰问受伤人员，并呈请中央人民政府严惩凶首，同时，加强本身组织，吁请各国侨胞一致声讨国民党匪帮余孽。
