Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 12th: The central organ newspaper of the China New Democratic Youth League, “China Youth” Weekly, published an editorial in its 26th issue entitled "Focus on Establishing the Youth League in the New District Peasant Movement This Winter." The editorial pointed out that this winter, vast liberated areas are carrying out bandit suppression, fighting local tyrants, or reducing rent and interest rates, while most of the areas in North China that have not yet distributed land are carrying out land reform. In the vast peasant revolutionary movement, tens of thousands of peasants will raise their class consciousness in the suppression of bandits and local tyrants and the reduction of rent and interest, and will be further liberated in the distribution of land. The editorial said: Peasant youth should actively participate in this great movement. Urban educated youth should go to the countryside in large numbers, integrate with the peasants, serve the peasants, and transform themselves in actual struggle. The experience of past land reform movements has proven that the consciousness of the broad masses of youth has been raised in this movement, and many young activists have emerged, urgently requiring the establishment of the Youth League. Therefore, it is very necessary to establish the Youth League in this bandit suppression, anti-local tyrant, rent reduction and interest reduction or land distribution movement. The editorial concluded: All rural youth work cadres must actively participate in bandit suppression, anti-local tyrant, rent reduction and interest reduction, or land distribution work, and must not be divorced from this mass movement and build the League in isolation. At the same time, do not abandon the work of building the League in this movement. It is necessary to mobilize the vast number of young peasants in this movement, and educate and organize them, discover activists, carry out propaganda about the Youth League as the entire movement progresses and the degree of mass awareness increases, and establish the organization of the Youth League with emphasis and in a step-by-step manner, absorbing outstanding youth from farm laborers, poor peasants, and middle peasants into the League. However, it is necessary to ensure that the leadership of the League is mainly placed on the shoulders of young people from farm laborer and poor peasant backgrounds. Progressive elementary school teachers and students in rural areas can also be admitted to the League.

    “中国青年”周刊号召青年
    今冬参加新区农民运动有重点地进行农村建团
    【新华社北京十二日电】中国新民主主义青年团中央机关报“中国青年”周刊第二十六期发表题为“要在今冬新区农民运动中有重点地建立青年团”的社论，社论指出：今年冬天广大解放地区进行剿匪、反对恶霸或减租减息，在华北未分配土地的地区中大部则进行土地改革。在广大农民的革命运动，成千成万的农民将在剿匪反恶霸、减租减息中提高自己的阶级觉悟，将在分配土地中进一步地获得解放。社论说：农民青年应该积极参加这一伟大的运动。城市的知识青年应该大量地到农村去，与农民结合，为农民服务，并在实际斗争中，改造自己。过去的土地改革运动的经验证明：广大青年在这个运动中，觉悟提高了，涌现出许多青年积极分子，迫切地需要建立青年团。因此，在这次剿匪反恶霸、减租减息或分配土地运动中，建立青年团是很必要的。社论最后说：一切农村青年工作干部要积极参加剿匪反恶霸、减租减息或分配土地等工作，决不能脱离了这个群众运动，孤立地建团，同时，也不要在这个运动中放弃建团工作。要在这个运动中发动广大青年农民，并教育和组织他们，发现积极分子，随着整个运动的进展，群众觉悟程度的提高，进行关于青年团的宣传，并应有重点、有步骤地建立青年团的组织，吸收雇农、贫农、中农中的优秀青年入团。但必须保障团的领导成份，主要是放在雇农、贫农出身的青年身上。对于农村里的进步的小学教师、学生，也可吸收入团。
