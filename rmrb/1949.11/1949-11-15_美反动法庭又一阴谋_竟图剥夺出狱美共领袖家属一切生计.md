Xinhua News Agency, New York, November 12th (TASS): The U.S. Department of Justice continues to attempt to persecute the bailed-out American Communist leaders. The U.S. government has recently been trying every means to deprive the defendants and their families of all livelihood. On November 10th, prosecutor Saypol declared that he was striving to seize all the property of the eleven American Communist leaders. He argued that this action was necessary before investigating whether the defendants could pay the $10,000 fine each as judged by Judge Medina. This is obviously a pretext for persecution, because the U.S. government also knows that if the original verdict cannot be overturned, the funds for paying the fine cannot be paid from the defendants' private assets, but will be paid by the Communist Party and other groups that support the eleven American Communist leaders.

One of the eleven "convicted" American Communist leaders, New York City Councilor Davis, stated that the government has already taken away his salary as a city councilor. The purpose of this measure is to attempt to expel him from the City Council before his term expires.

    美反动法庭又一阴谋
    竟图剥夺出狱美共领袖家属一切生计
    【新华社北京十四日电】塔斯社纽约十二日讯：美国司法部继续企图迫害保释的美共领袖，美政府最近正在想尽方法剥夺被告及其家属的一切生计。本月十日，检察官赛波尔宣称，他力求查封十一位美共领袖的一切财产。他辩解说，在调查被告是否能交纳法官麦迪纳所判每人一万元的罚金以前，采取这一行动是必要的。这显然是一种迫害的借口。因为美国政府也知道，如果不能推翻原判，那么交纳罚金的款项是不能由被告私人资产中支付，而是由共产党和其他维护十一位美共领袖的团体支付的。
    十一位“被判有罪”的美共领袖之一，纽约市议员戴维斯称：政府已经夺去了他当市议员的薪金。这一手段的目的，是企图在任期届满之前将他逐出市议会。
