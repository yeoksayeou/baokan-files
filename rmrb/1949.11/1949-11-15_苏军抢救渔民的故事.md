    Saving Benefactor
    The Story of the Soviet Army Rescuing Fishermen
    Xia Yuan
    In the late autumn of 1948, at dusk with a hazy twilight.
    At the southern tip of the Liaodong Peninsula, not far from Laotieshan, a fierce wind was hindering a returning fishing sailboat on the sea. The surging waves crashed from one end of the sailboat to the other, and the cabin was full of water. Three fishermen, drenched to the bone, were struggling. An old man with half-white beard shouted loudly:
    "Hold on! Hold on! Use your strength..."
    The sound of the wind and waves was too loud, and his voice was swallowed up by the sudden rain. The middle-aged fisherman's hat had long disappeared. He held the rudder with both hands, trying to hold the boat with all his strength, but even his clothes were stretched and torn, it was still useless. The sailboat followed the mountain of waves, sometimes tilting its head upwards, sometimes downwards. A wave of darkness came over, and the boat seemed to soar into the air, but in an instant, the sailboat was sucked away by the terrible tide, as if it had sunk, only to reveal a swaying shadow after a long while.
    The wind was getting stronger and stronger, the surging waves were even more turbulent, and the rain poured down. The pitiful sailboat completely lost its ability to control itself. The old fisherman desperately shouted again and again:
    "Hold on! Use your strength, use your strength...Seabed, torrential rain fanning from the side"
    The young lad hugged the middle of the boat, he was already terrified, looking into the boundless sea in the distance. He seemed to see some hope, his eyes almost popped out. The white foam of the rolling waves poured all over him, and the rain beat his face until it hurt, but he didn't care.
    Suddenly, he saw clearly, in the hazy mist to the east there was a black shadow, quickly cutting through the high waves, advancing straight in this direction.
    He was almost driven mad with joy, spitting out a mouthful of alkaline water, shouting:
    "The steamer is coming! Look!"
    The middle-aged fisherman didn't hear clearly and asked:
    "What?"
    He stretched his whole body out of the boat, pointing and shouting with his wet arms:
    "Isn't that it? A steamer!"
    Sure enough, it was a small Soviet navy warship, returning from a mission on the island. They saw the danger of the sailboat at sea through binoculars. An officer gave the order to proceed quickly in that direction.
    The roaring wind was shaking the sailboat without loosening for a second, and the waves wanted to swallow it at any moment. The young lad shouted with all his might!
    "Help! Help!"
    The old fisherman was about to go over to help steer.
    A fierce wave knocked him down, fortunately, he was quick-witted and grabbed the side of the boat with both hands. More than half of his body fell into the water, and the young lad grabbed his shoulder, desperately trying to drag him up, but he couldn't.
    The Soviet army's steamer quickly arrived, sailed to the sailboat, and threw a thick rope onto the sailboat.
    But the wind and waves were too strong, the rope fell into the water, the sailboat was undulating in the vortex of the waves, people were dizzy, and they couldn't muster any strength.
    On the Soviet army's steamer, an officer and five naval warriors were as anxious as ants in a hot pot, trying everything they could, but the rope could not reach the sailboat.
    One of the sailors was really anxious. He took off his shirt, braved the icy cold wind and rain, wrapped the rope around his shoulder, crossed the railing, and jumped into the sea with a splash.
    At this time, it was getting dark, and although the rain had weakened, the wind had not stopped. The waves crashed like mountains collapsing and the earth cracking.
    The sailor emerged from the sea very quickly, cutting through the waves, floated to the sailboat, climbed up, quickly tied the boat, and then helped drag the old fisherman up. In order to help the middle-aged fisherman steer, he was hit in the neck by the mast, but he forgot the pain, forgot the cold, and finally overcame the ruthless attack of the wind and waves, and brought the sailboat alongside the steamer.
    The night of the ocean had arrived long ago, the Soviet army's steamer delivered the three fishermen safely to their hometown—Laotieshan. The Soviet army's sailors helped them drag the sailboat ashore, and after seeing that there was nothing else they could help with, they drove the steamer slowly towards Lushui Bay.
    The three fishermen also forgot the cold, standing on the wet beach, reluctant to watch the Soviet army's steamer leave before remembering the danger just now, remembering their saviors, remembering their exhaustion and home...
    If anyone tells this story to the farmers in the coastal villages of Lushun and Dalian, most of them would not find it strange:
    "@, the Soviet army has helped us with so many things! More than just this one..."

    救命恩人
    苏军抢救渔民的故事
    夏园
    一九四八年深秋，暮色苍茫的黄昏时分。
    在辽东半岛的南头，距老铁山没有多远的海面上，狂风正把一只打鱼归来的帆船阻住，滚滚腾腾的波浪，从帆船的这一头打到那一头，帆船的舱里全进了水，三个渔夫衣服湿淋淋的，胡子半白的老乡大声叫喊：
    “把住啊！把住啊！使劲……”
    风声浪声太大，他的声音被突然降下的雨水吞没了。那中年渔夫的帽子早已不知去向，他两手把住了舵，拿出全身力气想把船撑住，可是连衣服都被绷扯了，还是不顶事。帆船顺着波浪的山，一回儿头向上抖，一回儿头向下斜，一阵漆黑的大浪过来，船象腾了半空一样，但是转瞬之间，帆船又被可怕的潮水吸去，好象沉没了似的，老半天才露出摇摇晃晃的影子。
    风是越来越大，澎澎湃湃的波涛更加汹涌，雨水如注，这只可怜的帆船完全失去了自主的能力，老年渔夫拼命的喊了又喊：
    “把住啊！使劲使劲……海底，倾盆的雨水从旁扇动”
    青年小伙子抱住船的中腰，他已吓得目瞪口呆，向茫茫的无边无际的大海的远处探望。他好象看见了什么希望似的，眼睛瞪得快要突出来了，翻滚的浪花的白沫从头上浇的他满身是水，雨水打的他脸都痛了，他也不管。
    突然给他看清楚了，在东面蒙蒙胧胧的雾里有一个黑影，很快的穿开了高越越的大浪，笔直的向着这个方向前进。
    他欢喜得几乎发疯似的，吐出满嘴碱水呐喊：
    “汽船过来啦！看哪！”
    中年渔夫没有听真，问道：
    “什么？”
    他把整个身子挺出船外，伸着水湿的胳臂指着大叫：
    “那不是吗？汽船！”
    果然不错，这是一只苏联海军军用的小型汽船，是到岛上办事归来的，他们在海上用望远镜看见了这只帆船的危险，一个军官便下令，急向这个方向前进。
    怒吼的狂风，一秒钟也不松懈的摆弄着帆船，浪涛时时刻刻都想把这只帆船吞进。青年小伙子拼力的喊了起来！
    “救命啊！救命啊！”
    老年渔夫正想过去帮着撑舵。
    一股凶猛的浪头把他打倒，幸亏眼明手快，两手抱住了船帮，多半个身子落进水里，青年小伙子抓住了他的肩膀，拼命的往上拖他，总是拖不上去。
    苏军的汽船飞快的赶来了，驶到帆船跟前，把一条粗绳往帆船上投去。
    但是风浪太大，绳子落进水里，帆船在浪涛的漩涡上颠波，人都发昏了，一点儿力气也使不上来。
    苏军的汽船上，一个军官，五个水上战士，急得象热锅里的蚂蚁似的，想尽一切办法，绳子总是不能达到帆船。
    一个水兵真急了，他脱下上衣，冒着冰冷刺骨的风雨，把绳子缠在肩上，跨过栏杆，扑嗵一声跳进海里。
    这时天色眼看就黑下来了，雨水虽然减低了威力，狂风却没有歇气，浪涛哗啦哗啦的象山崩地裂一样的发响。
    那个水兵非常敏捷的钻出海面，辟开浪山，浮到帆船跟前，爬了上去，迅速的绑住了船，又去帮着拖上老年渔夫，他为了帮助中年渔夫撑舵，被桅杆打破了脖子，可是他忘记了疼痛，也忘记了冷，终于战胜了风浪的无情袭击，把帆船靠上了汽船。
    海洋的夜色来临好久了，苏军的汽船把三个渔夫平平安安的送到他们的家乡——老铁山，苏军的水兵帮着他们把帆船拖到岸上，看看没有别的可帮助了，这才开了汽船，漫漫的向旅水湾驰去了。
    三个渔夫，也忘记了冷，站在潮湿的沙滩上，恋恋不舍的看着苏军的汽船开走了才想起刚才的危险，想起救命恩人，才想起一身的疲劳和家……。
    谁要是把这个故事对旅大沿海村庄的农民讲了，他们多半不觉得稀奇：
    “＠，苏军帮助我们的事情多啦！何止这么一桩……。”
