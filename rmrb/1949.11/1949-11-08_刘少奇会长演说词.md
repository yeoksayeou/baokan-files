Comrades!

Today is the 32nd anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution in the Soviet Union. Our members of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and the Chinese people warmly celebrate this great festival! Celebrate the happy life the Soviet people have obtained after the victory of the revolution! Celebrate the great success of Soviet socialist construction! Celebrate the health of Marshal Stalin!

The victory of the Soviet October Revolution opened up the greatest new era in the history of mankind and pointed out the path of liberation for all oppressed classes and oppressed nations in the world. The revolutionary Chinese people can deeply understand this great historical significance of the October Revolution. The Chinese people, under the cruel oppression of imperialism and feudalism, clearly understand in their long revolutionary struggle against imperialism and feudalism: Thanks to the strong existence of the Soviet Union, thanks to the example and assistance of the Soviet Union, their revolutionary struggle can achieve victory, and today the great Chinese People's Revolution has indeed achieved victory. In the revolutionary struggle, whenever the Chinese people encountered difficulties and suffered failures, their confidence in victory never wavered, because they saw the strong existence of the Soviet Union and the rapid progress of Soviet construction, they had great hope, were full of confidence, and believed that their revolution was sure to win. History proves that this confidence of the Chinese people is correct and not wrong; because the Soviet October Revolution was not just a revolution within the scope of the Soviet Union, it was first and foremost an international and global revolution, and the Chinese People's Great Revolution against imperialism and feudalism is a continuation of the October Revolution. Stalin said: "The world significance of the October Revolution lies not only in the fact that it was the great founding of a country in breaking through the imperialist system, not only in the fact that it was the first socialist base in the vast ocean of imperialist countries, but also in the fact that it was the powerful foundation for the first stage of the world revolution and the continued development of the world revolution." The Chinese People's Great Revolution against imperialism and feudalism is a part of the world revolution that has developed on this powerful foundation, and a very great part.

After the victory of the Soviet October Revolution, the victory of the Second World Anti-Fascist War was achieved, and thus many new democratic countries in Europe were created. Now the great victory of the Chinese People's Revolution has been achieved, and the complete liberation of 475 million Chinese people is not far off. The powerful People's Liberation Army has occupied Guangdong and has entered Xinjiang, and will soon occupy Guangxi, Guizhou, and Sichuan. The liberation of Yunnan, Xikang, Tibet, Hainan Island, and Taiwan will also not be far off. The people of the entire China are rising up vigorously to eliminate the remaining forces of imperialism and feudalism and establish their new life. This is another October Revolution that has taken place on the land of China—China's October Revolution. The world significance of the Chinese October Revolution is the same as the world significance of the Soviet October Revolution, which greatly strengthens and expands the "powerful foundation for the continued development of the world revolution." Although the Chinese People's Great Revolution is still a new democratic revolution against imperialism and feudalism in terms of its general nature, and not a socialist revolution, this is where the Chinese People's Great Revolution differs from the Soviet October Revolution, but this difference does not detract from the great world historical significance of the Chinese Revolution in the slightest.

Comrades! You can imagine: with the Soviet Union, with the new democratic countries, and with the powerful People's Republic of China, these countries not only have their political unity and ideological unity, but also are geographically connected. What impact will their strong existence and continued development have on the world? The current world situation is no longer the situation in the years after the victory of the Soviet October Revolution. The world has entered a new stage. In this stage, Marxism-Leninism, the experience of the Soviet October Revolution, and the experience of the Chinese Revolution will be accepted and applied by advanced elements and working people in many countries with unprecedented breadth. The development of the revolution will proceed at an unprecedented speed, which is completely predictable. Molotov said: The era we are in is an era where all roads lead to communism. Isn't it obvious now?

Under the current world situation, the dying imperialists and reactionaries cannot but be panic-stricken. This is the real reason why the imperialists are trying to create new dangers of war. Everyone knows that what the Soviet Union, the new democratic countries, and our victorious New China need is a peaceful environment, to actively build their own countries, and not war. However, the imperialists insist that the Soviet Union wants war, and fabricate rumors that the Soviet army will land in the United States. It must be understood that the primary purpose of the imperialists in creating this new danger of war is to suppress the increasingly revolutionary people in their own countries and the national liberation movements in colonies and semi-colonies. The imperialists are afraid that the influence of those countries where the revolution has already been victorious will spread to the people in their own countries and affiliated countries. They need to establish an "iron curtain," trying to block these countries so that the influence of these countries cannot go out, and endlessly fabricate rumors to slander these countries, so that the people in their own countries and affiliated countries cannot understand the truth about these countries. This is the main method currently used by the imperialists and reactionaries of all countries to oppose the revolutionized people. This is a concrete manifestation of their panic.

After the victory of the Soviet October Revolution, the imperialists said: The Soviet regime could not last for three months. Under this erroneous estimate, they organized interventionist troops from fourteen countries to intervene in the Soviet revolution. However, as a result, it was not the Soviet regime that could not be maintained, but the imperialists' own interventionist troops. Now that the Chinese revolution has been victorious, the imperialists are saying again: The Chinese people's revolutionary regime will not be able to overcome its own difficulties, will surrender to difficulties, and will not be able to maintain power. However, they seem to dare not organize any more interventionist troops to intervene in the Chinese revolution. If there are such interventionist troops coming to China again, then, I am afraid that these interventionist troops will not only be unable to maintain themselves, but after coming to China, they will never be able to return. And what will not be able to be maintained will not be the Chinese people's regime, but the imperialists themselves.

Comrade Mao Zedong said: In the overall strategic policy, we should despise the enemy, and do not overestimate the enemy's strength or underestimate our own strength, thus shrinking back; but in the tactics of each specific battle, we should pay attention to the enemy, and do not show contempt for the enemy and arrogance, rashly enter the battle or respond hastily, thus suffering setbacks. Despising the enemy strategically and paying attention to the enemy tactically in each specific battle, combining these two, is one of our strategic and tactical guiding principles for defeating the enemy. This principle is applicable everywhere. The imperialists and reactionaries are dying things, they are panic-stricken, outwardly strong but inwardly weak, they are counter-revolutionary and anti-people, they are all paper tigers, they should and can be overthrown, they have long been overthrown in the Soviet Union, they have also been overthrown in the new democratic countries, they have been overthrown in our China, and in other countries in the world, as long as the people there can unite and resolutely struggle against them, not believe in their deception and intimidation, they will certainly be able to overthrow them. That is to say, revolutionary parties and revolutionary people must despise the enemy in the strategic policy of dealing with enemies such as imperialists and reactionaries, and absolutely do not overestimate the enemy. This is one aspect. But on the other hand, it should also be seen that imperialists and reactionaries still have a certain strength in certain places today, so when conducting specific struggles with them, we must pay attention to their certain strength, we must make a careful and concrete analysis of their strength, we must carefully prepare and deploy our own strength, and use our strength that exceeds the enemy's several times to defeat the enemy, so as to be invincible and to be sure to win concrete struggles one after another. When the struggle cannot be won, we can also protect the retreat in a timely manner, so as not to fall into a passive position. Only by not despising the enemy in the tactics of each specific struggle and winning concrete struggles one after another can we despise the enemy in the overall aspect and in the overall strategy on a well-founded basis. Only by despising the enemy in the overall strategic policy can we conduct concrete struggles against the enemy carefully, tirelessly, and with confidence. Adopting this guiding principle of strategy and tactics is a powerful weapon to defeat the imperialists and reactionaries.

We despise the imperialists and reactionaries, we compare them to paper tigers, but we must also state at the same time: we do not underestimate the enemy in the tactics of specific struggles against imperialists and reactionaries. In this way, we are more entitled to despise the imperialists and reactionaries, and are entitled to hope that they will die sooner.

Let the imperialists and reactionaries die! Send them to the grave faster!

Long live the victory of the Soviet October Revolution!
Long live the victory of the Chinese People's Great Revolution!
Workers and working people of the world, unite!
Down with imperialism!

　　刘少奇会长演说词
    【新华社北京七日电】中苏友好协会会长刘少奇在该会主办的十月革命三十二周年庆祝大会上的演说词全文如下：同志们！
    今天是伟大的苏联十月社会主义革命的三十二周年纪念日。我们中苏友好协会的会员和中国人民热烈地庆祝这个伟大的节日！庆祝苏联人民在革命胜利后所获得的幸福生活！庆祝苏联社会主义建设的伟大成功！庆祝斯大林大元帅的健康！
    苏联十月革命的胜利，开创了人类历史发展最伟大的新时代，指出了全世界一切被压迫阶级和被压迫民族的解放道路。十月革命的这种伟大历史意义，革命的中国人民是能够深刻地理解的。中国人民在帝国主义和封建主义的残酷压迫之下，在长期的反对帝国主义和封建主义的革命斗争中，清楚地了解：由于有了苏联的强大存在，由于有了苏联的榜样和苏联的援助，他们的革命斗争就能够获得胜利，而今天中国人民大革命也就真的得到了胜利。中国人民在革命斗争中，每当遇到困难、受到失败的时候，他们的胜利信心从来就没有丧失过，因为他们看到了苏联的强大存在，苏联建设的突飞猛进，他们就有了极大的希望，充满了信心，相信他们的革命是有把握胜利的。历史证明：中国人民的这种信心是正确的，没有错误的；因为苏联十月革命本来就不仅仅只是苏联一国范围内的革命，它首先就是国际性世界性的一个革命，而中国反对帝国主义与封建主义的人民大革命，就是十月革命的直接继续。斯大林说：“十月革命底世界意义，不仅在于它是一个国家在冲破帝国主义体系这件事业中的伟大创始，不仅在于它是帝国主义国家汪洋大海中的第一个社会主义策源地，而且还在于它是世界革命第一阶段和世界革命继续发展过程底强大基础”。反对帝国主义和封建主义的中国人民大革命，就正是在这个强大基础上发展起来的世界革命的一部分，而且是极为伟大的一部分。
    在苏联十月革命胜利之后，又取得了第二次世界反法西斯战争的胜利，因而产生了欧洲许多新民主主义国家。现在中国人民大革命又取得了伟大的胜利，四万万七千五百万中国人民的完全解放，已经为期不远了。强大的人民解放军已经占领广东，并已进入了新疆，即将占领广西、贵州和四川，云南、西康、西藏以及海南岛和台湾的解放亦将为期不远，全中国的人民正在轰轰烈烈地起来肃清帝国主义与封建主义的残余势力，建立自己的新生活。这是在中国这块土地上发生的另一次十月革命—中国的十月革命。中国十月革命的世界意义，也和苏联十月革命的世界意义一样，它是极大地加强和扩大了“世界革命继续发展过程的强大基础”。中国人民大革命从一般的性质上讲虽然还是反对帝国主义和封建主义的新民主主义的革命，还不是社会主义性质的革命，这是中国人民大革命区别于苏联十月革命的地方，但是这种区别丝毫也不损害中国革命的伟大的世界历史意义。
    同志们！你们可以想得到：有了苏联，有了各新民主国家，又有了强大的中中华人民共和国，这些国家不只是有它们的政治上的一致和思想上的一致，而且在地理上也是联成一片的，它们的强大存在和继续发展，在世界上将要发生一些什么影响。现在世界的这种形势，已经不是苏联十月革命胜利之后若干年内的形势了，世界已经进入一个新的阶段，在这个阶段中，马克思、列宁主义，苏联十月革命的经验和中国革命的经验，将要无比广泛地被许多国家的先进分子和劳动人民所接受与应用起来，革命的发展将要以从来未有的速度行进，这是完全可以预见得到的。莫洛托夫说过：我们所处的时代，是条条道路都通到共产主义的时代。难道现在还不明显吗？
    处在目前这种世界形势下面，即将死亡的帝国主义者和反动派不能不恐慌万状。这就是帝国主义者努力制造新的战争危险的真实原因。谁也知道：苏联、各新民主国家和我们胜利后的新中国所需要的，是和平的环境，是积极建设自己的国家，而不是需要战争。然而帝国主义者硬说苏联要战争，并造作谣言说：苏联军队将在美国登陆。必须明白：帝国主义者制造这种新的战争危险的首要目的，就是要镇压它们国内日益革命化了的人民和殖民地半殖民地的民族解放运动。帝国主义者害怕那些革命业已胜利了的国家的影响扩展到自己国内及附属国的人民中去，它们就需要建立“铁幕”，企图封锁这些国家，使这些国家的影响不能外出，并且无穷尽地造作谣言去诬蔑这些国家，使它们自己国内及附属国的人民无法了解这些国家的真象。这就是目前帝国主义者和各国反动派反对革命化了的人民的主要方法。这就是它们恐慌万状的具体表现。
    在苏联十月革命胜利之后，帝国主义者说：苏维埃政权不能维持三个月。它们在这种错误的估计之下组织了十四个国家的干涉军去干涉苏联的革命。然而，结果，维持不下去的，不是苏维埃政权，而是帝国主义者自己的干涉军。现在中国革命胜利，帝国主义者又说：中国人民革命政权将不能克服自己的困难，将要向困难投降，将不能维持政权。然而，它们似乎已不敢再组织什么干涉军来干涉中国革命了。如果再有这种干涉军来到中国的话，那末，这种干涉军恐怕就不仅只是维持不下去而已，它来到中国之后，将再也回不去了。而维持不下去的，将不会是中国的人民政权，而会是帝国主义者自己。
    毛泽东同志说：在全般的战略方针上应该渺视敌人，而不要过高地估计敌人的力量与过低地估计自己的力量，因而畏缩不前；但在每一个具体战斗的战术上就应重视敌人，而不要表示轻敌和骄傲，轻率地进入战斗或仓促应战，因而遭受挫败。在战略上轻视敌人，在每一个具体战斗的战术上重视敌人，使这二者结合起来，这就是我们战胜敌人的战略战术指导原则之一。这个原则在一切地方都是可以适用的。帝国主义者和反动派，是即将死亡的东西，它们恐慌万状，外强中乾，它们反革命、反人民，它们都是一些纸老虎，它们是应该而且能够被打倒的，它们在苏联早已被打倒，在各新民主国家也已被打倒，在我们中国又已被打倒，在世界其他国家，只要那里的人民能够团结起来，坚决和它们斗争，不信它们的欺骗和恐吓，也一定能够把它们打倒。这就是说，革命的政党和革命的人民在对付帝国主义者和反动派这些敌人的战略方针上必须渺视敌人，绝对不要过高地估计敌人。这是一方面。但是，在另一方面，也应该看到帝国主义者和反动派在今天，在一定的地方，还是有它们一定的力量的，故在和它们进行具体斗争的时候，必须重视它们这种一定的力量，必须对它们的力量作仔细的具体的分析，必须仔细地准备与部署自己的力量，用自己超过敌人数倍的力量去战胜敌人，才能立于不败之地，才能有把握地一次一次地去取得具体斗争的胜利，在斗争不能获胜时，亦能适时地掩护退却，不致陷于被动。只有在每一个具体斗争的战术上不轻视敌人，一次一次地取得具体斗争的胜利，才能在总的方面，在全般战略上有根据地去渺视敌人。只有在总的战略方针上渺视敌人，才能仔细地、不疲倦地、有信心地去进行对敌人的具体斗争。采取这种战略战术的指导原则，是战胜帝国主义者和反动派的一个有力武器。
    我们渺视帝国主义者和反动派，我们把它们比作纸老虎，但是我们必须同时声明一句：我们在反对帝国主义和反动派的具体斗争的战术上并不轻敌。如此，我们就更加有权利去渺视帝国主义者和反动派，并有权利去希望它们快点死亡。
    让帝国主义者和反动派死亡吧！把它们更快的送进坟墓中去！
    苏联十月革命胜利万岁！
    中国人民大革命胜利万岁！
    全世界的无产阶级和劳动人民团结起来！
    打倒帝国主义！
