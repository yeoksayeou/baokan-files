Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 28th: The various units of the Third Field Army, while suppressing bandits in Zhejiang, southern Anhui, and other places, are also mobilizing the masses in the newly liberated areas and carrying out the tasks of work teams. Over the past few months, they have achieved some successes and gained experience. Since July, various units have successively drawn a large number of cadres, veteran soldiers, Communist Party members, combined with local work cadres and young intellectuals from the newly liberated areas, to form armed work teams and go deep into the countryside to carry out work. The Zhejiang Military Region and a certain corps under the Third Field Army initially dispatched more than 4,000 people in early August, and later sent another 2,300 cadres to work in local troops. Before going to the countryside, all work teams underwent short-term training, so that the members clearly understood that doing mass work is one of the three major tasks of the People's Liberation Army, and the importance of this work in building a new democratic China, dispelling the team members' concerns about language barriers, lack of experience, and difficulties in local work, and actively and happily going to the countryside to work.

After the work teams went to the countryside, they quickly and successfully launched their work in coordination with the local people's governments and the field army's bandit suppression troops, due to their promotion of the troops' virtues of hard work, simplicity, and strong discipline. In areas with severe banditry, the people in the newly liberated areas did not dare to approach the work teams because they did not understand the policies of the people's government, coupled with the threats and deceptions of bandits and secret agents. At this time, the work teams carried out bandit suppression on the one hand, and propaganda and mobilization of the masses on the other. The work teams universally learned about the situation gradually by helping farmers with labor, visiting farmers in distress, and publicizing policies, developing and cultivating activists, so that farmers gradually dared to approach the work teams. The work teams in Datian, Kaishi, and other places in Linhai County, Zhejiang Province, also changed their living systems to adapt to the labor and living habits of the farmers, which facilitated their work. In addition, various forms of meetings, such as farmers' associations, village meetings, and meetings of puppet Baojia personnel, were used to widely publicize the current situation and the policies of the people's government, in order to dispel the concerns of the masses. After the bandits were largely eliminated, the situation was initially understood, and the masses' awareness had begun to increase, the work teams widely assisted farmers in organizing farmers' associations through production relief, reasonable burden, and anti-despot work, and gradually established farmers' self-defense armed forces. A certain army's work teams sent to the Jinhua and Qu County areas boldly carried out their work after initially eliminating armed bandits and secret agents. Through grain requisition, they widely organized farm laborers, poor peasants, middle peasants, handicraftsmen, and poor rural intellectuals to join the farmers' associations. By the end of September, the 32 work teams dispatched by the army's directly subordinate units had completed 90% of the grain requisition task in 32 townships, captured and disintegrated 310 bandits, organized more than 34,000 members of farmers' associations, and 676 farmers' self-defense teams. The self-defense teams stood guard and patrolled passers-by during the day, and patrolled at night. Some also assisted the work teams in suppressing bandits. The organized farmers widely launched the struggle against local bullies. A certain army, which carried out bandit suppression and work team tasks in the Anhui-Zhejiang border and southern Anhui, formed 94 armed work teams with more than 1,000 cadres, distributed them in key bandit suppression areas, combined military bandit suppression with political offensives to disintegrate bandits and secret agents, and assisted farmers in launching anti-despot struggles. In the past two months, according to incomplete statistics, the organized members of farmers' associations have reached more than 73,000, trade union members more than 2,200, and more than 10,000 militiamen and self-defense teams have been developed. In addition, youth, women, and other organizations have also been developed. The achievements in disintegrating bandits and secret agents are also great. For example, three work teams in Chun'an alone recruited more than 90 bandits to surrender. The areas where banditry has been basically eliminated have begun to launch a rent reduction campaign.

Because most of the work team members are cadres and veteran soldiers from the troops, lacking experience in local mass work, coupled with the actual difficulties in the new district work, some team members had the phenomenon of being uneasy about work and holding temporary task views at the beginning of the work. However, due to the attention of the leading organs at all levels to ideological leadership, timely discovery and assistance in solving problems, and the gradual development of work and significant achievements, the confidence of the team members has been improved, so the phenomenon of being uneasy about work has been basically overcome.

The problems existing in the work of the work teams are, first of all, the low level of policy, which is manifested in the fact that some comrades are afraid of making mistakes and dare not let go of their work; individual units still have the phenomenon of random shooting and random arrests; individual work team members are not good at analyzing problems from a class point of view, and are confused by certain bad elements; or the scope of attack in the anti-despot struggle is too large, relying solely on poor peasants and hired peasants and ignoring the unity of middle peasants, ignoring the efforts to win over poor intellectuals and enlightened gentry. Secondly, in terms of work style and methods, some comrades are very enthusiastic, but eager to achieve success, so the work is simplified, impatient, and coercive; others are not good at using and organizing activists, doing everything themselves, and falling into bureaucracy. In terms of working methods, they only know how to have individual talks and small meetings, and are not good at boldly using organizations, holding large meetings, and organizing farmers' associations in various ways. In addition, there are also a very few work team members who have unstable positions and insufficient understanding of the complexity of rural class struggle, and their discipline is not strong, thus producing errors such as accepting gifts from landlords and rich peasants and being seduced by women. The above-mentioned errors and shortcomings have been gradually corrected or overcome by the work teams in the process of work, under the slogan of "learning while doing", through summarizing work and concentrated learning. At present, most of the work teams are conducting short-term policy and discipline study and summarizing work, in order to improve the work and better carry out the rural work in the new district.

　　三野执行工作队任务
  　深入农村发动群众
    在浙江、皖南地区广泛组织农民协会  胜利推行剿匪、秋征、减租等工作
    【新华社南京二十八日电】第三野战军各部在浙江、皖南等地进行剿匪，同时发动新区群众，执行工作队任务，数月来已获得了若干成绩和经验。自七月以来，各部即陆续抽调大批干部、老战士、共产党员结合地方工作干部及新区知识青年，组织武装工作队，深入农村进行工作。浙江军区暨第三野战军某兵团所属各部于八月初首次派出四千余人，其后又派出二千三百余干部至地方部队工作。各工作队在下乡前均进行了短期学习，使队员们明确认识做群众工作是人民解放军三大任务之一，和这一工作在建设新民主主义中国中的重要性，打破队员们怕言语不通、没有经验、地方工作吃不开等思想顾虑，积极愉快地下乡工作。
    工作队下乡后，因发扬了部队同志艰苦朴素、纪律性强等优点，在各地人民政府与野战军剿匪部队配合下，迅速胜利地展开工作。在匪患较严重的地区，新区人民因不了解人民政府的政策，加上土匪特务的威胁欺骗，不敢与工作队接近。这时工作队即一面剿匪，一面进行宣传和发动群众。工作队普遍通过帮助农民劳动，访问农民痛苦，宣传政策，逐步了解情况，发展与培养积极分子，使农民逐渐敢于与工作队接近。在浙江临海县大田、开石等地的工作队，还改变了自己的生活制度，以适应农民的劳动和生活习惯，便于工作。此外并利用各种形式的会议，如农民会、村民大会、伪保甲人员会等。广泛宣传目前形势与人民政府的政策，以打破群众顾虑。在土匪大致肃清，情况初步了解，群众觉悟已开始提高后，工作队即通过生产救灾、合理负担、反恶霸等工作，广泛协助农民组织农民协会，并逐步建立农民自卫武装。某军派至金华、衢县一带的工作队，在初步肃清武装土匪特务后，大胆放手开展工作，通过征粮广泛组织雇农、贫农、中农、手工业者、农村贫苦知识分子加入农会。该军直属队派出的三十二个工作队在三十二个乡中，至九月底止，即完成征粮任务百分之九十，俘获和瓦解土匪三百一十人，组织农民协会会员三万四千余名，农民自卫队六百七十六名。自卫队白天站岗放哨，盘查行人，夜间巡逻，有的并协助工作队剿匪，组织起来了的农民广泛展开了反恶霸斗争。在皖浙边及皖南执行剿匪与工作队任务的某军，以一千余干部组成九十四个武装工作队，分布于剿匪重点区内，结合军事剿匪以政治攻势瓦解土匪特务，并协助农民展开反恶霸斗争。两个月来，据不完全统计，组织起来的农民协会会员已达七万三千多人，工会会员二千二百多人，发展民兵自卫队一万多人，此外青年、妇女等组织也均有发展。瓦解土匪特务的成绩也很大，如淳安一地三个工作队即招降土匪九十多人，现匪患基本肃清地区已开始展开减租运动。
    由于工作队员多数是部队中的干部与老战士，缺乏地方群众工作经验，加以新区工作中的实际困难，部分队员在工作开始时曾产生不安心工作，抱临时任务观点的现象。但由于各级领导机关注意了思想领导，及时发现并协助解决问题，以及工作日益开展，成绩逐渐显著，队员信心提高，因而不安心工作现象，已基本上得到克服。
    各工作队工作中存在的问题，首先是政策水平低，表现在部分同志怕犯错误，不敢放手工作；个别单位尚有乱起枪、乱捕人的现象；个别工作队员不善于从阶级观点分析问题，被某些坏分子所迷惑；或则在反恶霸斗争中打击面过大，单纯依靠贫农雇农忽视团结中农，忽视争取贫苦知识分子和开明士绅等。其次在工作作风与方法方面，部分同志热情甚高，但急于求成，因此工作简单化，急躁，强迫命令；有的则不善于运用和组织积极分子，事事自己动手，陷于事务主义。工作方式上则只会个别谈话，开小会，不善于大胆放手利用组织，开大会，以及用各种方式组织农民协会等。此外，也有极少数工作队员立场不稳，对农村阶级斗争的复杂性认识不足，纪律性不强，因而产生接受地主富农馈赠，被女色引诱等错误。上述错误与缺点，各工作队在工作过程中，在“边做边学”的口号下，通过总结工作，集中学习等方式，已逐步纠正或克服。现大部分工作队正进行短时期的政策纪律学习和总结工作，以便将工作提高一步，更好地开展新区农村工作。
