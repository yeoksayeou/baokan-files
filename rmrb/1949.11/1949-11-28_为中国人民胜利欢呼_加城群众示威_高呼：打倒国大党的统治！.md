　　Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 26th: Calcutta airmail: The Bengal Provincial Trade Union Congress organized a grand demonstration parade in Calcutta on October 1st, with 4,000 people participating, to celebrate the founding of the People's Republic of China. The marching crowds passed through the main streets of central and northern Calcutta, receiving enthusiastic cheers from the citizens. This demonstration was an expression of the Calcutta working people's jubilation for the Chinese people's historic victory. Crowds on both sides of the street marched along with the demonstration. The demonstrators deeply believed that the victory of the Chinese revolution greatly benefited the millions of Indian working people in their struggle against poverty and capitalist exploitation. They shouted: "Down with the rule of the Congress Party!", "Declare the Communist Party legal!", "Long live Comrade Ranadive!" (Note: Ranadive is the General Secretary of the Communist Party of India). Not long ago, a 5,000-person rally was held here to celebrate the victory of the Chinese people. The propaganda teams of the rally and demonstration were attacked by the police. The police seized the slogans and portraits carried by the propaganda teams and arrested eight people.

    【新华社布拉格二十六日电】加尔各答航讯：孟加拉省职工大会于十月一日在加尔各答组织了一个有四千群众参加的盛大示威游行，庆贺中华人民共和国的成立。游行的队伍穿过加尔各答中部和北部的各主要街道，受到了市民的热烈欢呼。这次示威是加尔各答劳动人民为中国人民的历史性胜利而欢欣鼓舞的表示。街道两旁的人群与示威队伍同时行进。示威者深深相信：中国革命的胜利，大大有利于千百万印度劳苦人民去进行反对贫困和资本主义剥削的斗争，他们高呼：“打倒国大党的统治！”，“宣布共产党合法！”，“兰那第夫同志万岁！”（按兰那第夫是印度共产党的总书记）。不久以前，此间曾举行一个五千人的大会，庆贺中国人民的胜利。大会和示威的宣传队，受到警察的攻击。警察夺取了宣传队携带的标语、画像，并逮捕了八个人。
