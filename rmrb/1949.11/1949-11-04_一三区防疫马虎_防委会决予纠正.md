　　Poor Epidemic Prevention in the First and Third Districts
  　Defense Committee Decides to Rectify

    [Another Dispatch] Zhangjiakou City has launched intensive examination and autopsy work. Eight corpses have been dissected in recent days. Only one female corpse from Jijiafangzi Village was confirmed to have pneumonic plague. After the female corpse was dissected on the 30th and the smear static examination proved to be plague, animal inoculation experiments were carried out. The inoculated mice died at noon on the 2nd. Although the epidemic situation in Zhangjiakou City has not changed significantly, it cannot be ignored. Yesterday, seven people died, three of whom suffered from acute hematemesis. The epidemic prevention team dissected four deceased today. Whether it is plague will be determined in a few days. It is worth noting that one person each died in Yaojiafangzi Village and Hutu Village, which are adjacent to the plague-stricken village of Jijiafangzi. The time from onset to death was only three days. The former's symptoms were dizziness and vomiting, and the latter vomited yellow water and blood. Therefore, strict and ruthless blockade is the most important thing in epidemic prevention work. As for epidemic prevention and injection work, after the Central Epidemic Prevention Headquarters arrived in Zhangjiakou on the 31st, it began live bacteria injection at 4 pm on the same day. According to statistics as of 11 pm yesterday, 4,690 people have been injected. Yesterday and today, the injection team worked in ten groups. It is expected that all personnel from agencies, schools, and troops in Zhangjiakou City will be injected by the 4th of this month. Mass injections in the Second District have already begun from today (2nd).

　　一三区防疫马虎
  　防委会决予纠正
    【又电】张市已展开了紧张的检验解剖工作，日前已解剖了八个尸体，其中仅吉家房子村一女尸验明确为肺鼠疫，该女尸于三十日经解剖涂片静检证明为鼠疫后，继实行动物接种实验，被接种之老鼠于二日午时死去。目前张市疫情虽无大的变化，但亦不容忽视。昨日一天病死七人，其中有三个人是患急性吐血。防疫队本日解剖四个死者，是否是鼠疫需待三数日始能判明。值得注意的是疫村吉家房子邻近的姚家房子村、护涂地村亦各死一人，发病至死，历时仅三日，前者症状为头昏呕吐，后者是吐黄水吐血。因之严格无情封锁在防疫工作中是头等的重要大事。至防疫注射工作，中央防疫总队三十一日抵张后，当日下午四时便开始生菌注射，至昨日下午十一时统计，已注射了四千六百九十个人。昨、今两日，注射队分十组分头工作，本月四日张家口全市之机关、学校、部队人员，可望全部注射完毕，二区从今（二）日起已开始给群众注射。
