　　Shanghai's Domestic Trade Increases
　　Uninterrupted Supply of Industrial Raw Materials, Expanding Sales of Products
    [Shanghai Dispatch] Under the guidance of the free trade policy, Shanghai's domestic trade has overcome the enemy's economic blockade, surmounted the difficulties of water and land transportation, and gradually achieved recovery and development. The Shanghai Railway Bureau's outbound cargo in June was 24,200 metric tons, and inbound cargo was 22,189 metric tons. Taking the figures for June as a base, the total value of outbound goods in October increased nearly doubled, and inbound increased sixfold. Inbound goods mainly consisted of grain, coal, industrial raw materials, and local products from various regions, while outbound goods mainly consisted of yarn, cloth, and other industrial products. Private capital has played a significant role in domestic trade. According to statistics from the Shanghai Railway Bureau, of the three inbound commodities—grain, cotton, and coal—in October, private merchants handled 65 percent of the total inbound volume. Due to the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, not only was the food and coal shortage in the early days of Shanghai's liberation overcome, but state-owned enterprises were also able to further control the market prices of essential necessities. The number of people supplied with rice as a priority by the Grain Company reached 8 percent of the city's population in October, and the lives of workers, students, and staff have been adequately secured. Due to the steady supply of industrial raw materials and the growing sales of products, the production of Shanghai's major industries has been maintained. According to September statistics, the total number of spindles in operation in 53 private cotton mills in the city increased from 1,106,980 at the end of June to 1,150,721, and the average weekly operating time also increased from three days and three nights in August to four days and four nights in October. The China Textile Company's Cotton Textile Department is now operating four days and six nights per week. The Heavy Industry Department supports private machine factories by placing orders for goods from various regions. By October, 858 private machine factories in the city had resumed operation, and even the Shanghai Machine Factory, which had been shut down for a year, had resumed production. To further develop domestic trade, in the future, in addition to strengthening water and land transportation and vigorously mobilizing and assisting legitimate merchants to go deep into the interior to purchase materials and promote industrial finished products, attention should also be paid to adjusting the comparative prices of industrial and agricultural products, strengthening market management, and preventing speculative and disruptive activities by unscrupulous merchants.

　　上海对内贸易增加
　　工业原料供应不竭产品销路日益宽广
    【本报上海专讯】上海市对内贸易工作，在贸易自由的政策指导下，已经战胜了敌人的经济封锁，克服了水陆交通的困难，逐步获得恢复发展。上海铁路局六月份输出物资二四、二○○公吨，输入物资二二、一八九公吨，以六月份的数字为基数，十月份输出总额增加近一倍，输入增加则达六倍。在输入物资中以粮食、煤、工业原料及各地土产为主，输出则以纱、布及其他工业品为主。私人资本在对内贸易中起了不小的作用，据上海铁路局统计，十月份输入的粮食、棉花及煤三项物资中，私商经营的即占输入总数的百分之六十五。由于城乡物资的交流，不仅渡过了上海解放初期的粮荒和煤荒，国营企业并能进一步掌握了主要生活必需品的市场价格。粮食公司重点配米人数，十月份已达全市人口的百分之八，工人、学生及职员的生活已得到适当保障。由于工业原料的源源供应和产品的销路日广，使上海主要工业的生产得以维持。据九月份统计，全市五十三家私营纱厂的总开工锭数已由六月底的一、一○六、九八○枚增至一、一五○、七二一枚，每周平均开工数亦由八月份的三日三夜增至十月份的四日四夜；中纺公司棉纺部每周已开工四日六夜。重工业处用代各地订货物的方法扶持私营机器工厂，至十月份全市已有八百五十八家私营机器厂开工，连停工已一年的上海机器厂也复工了。为进一步发展对内贸易，今后除应加强水陆交通运输，大力发动与帮助正当商人深入内地采购物资和推销工业成品外，并应注意调整工农产品的比价，加强市场的管理，防止奸商投机捣把的破坏活动。
