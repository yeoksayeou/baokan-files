Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, December 12th: Today is Sun Yat-sen's birthday. More than 500 representatives from the Nanjing Municipal People's Government, the Military Control Commission, the Nanjing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and various circles visited the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum in Zijin Mountain this morning. The memorial ceremony began at 10:30 a.m. with the national anthem. General Su Yu, Director of the Military Control Commission, presided over the ceremony. Participants also included Ke Qingshi, Deputy Mayor of the People's Government; Tang Liang, Deputy Secretary of the Nanjing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party; Li Fangxun, Wu Yifang, Xu Yangqiu, and Chen Zhongfan, representatives from various democratic parties and cultural circles; Yang Yi, a representative of ethnic minorities; Ning Pingqing, a representative of the business community; and representatives of the People's Liberation Army, workers, and students garrisoning Nanjing. After laying flowers at Sun Yat-sen's portrait, General Su Yu delivered a brief speech. In his speech, he pointed out that Sun Yat-sen made a great contribution to leading the 1911 Revolution to overthrow the autocratic Qing regime and ending China's three thousand years of monarchical autocracy during his forty years of revolutionary struggle. Sun Yat-sen experienced several failures in the forty years of revolution until he saw the victory of the October Revolution and found a clear direction, deciding to "take Russia as a teacher" and formulated the three major policies of alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to workers and peasants. He then said indignantly: Since Sun Yat-sen's death in 1925, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit group has betrayed Sun Yat-sen's correct propositions and betrayed the people; while the Chinese Communist Party has continued to lead the Chinese people in heroic struggle and achieved today's victory. He emphasized that the ideal Sun Yat-sen entrusted in his will, that the Chinese and Soviet "allies must go hand in hand to victory," has been realized today due to the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the heroic struggle of the Chinese people. He finally called on everyone to carry the revolution through to the end, thoroughly liberate all of China, and consolidate the fruits of the people's victory. After the speech, General Su Yu led all the representatives to pay their respects to the remains.

    纪念孙中山诞辰
    南京各界代表昨谒陵
    粟裕将军献花后作简短演说
    【新华社南京十二日电】今日为孙中山先生诞辰。宁市人民政府、军事管制委员会、中共南京市委会及各界代表五百余人于上午前往紫金山谒陵。谒陵仪式于上午十时三十分在国歌声中开始，由军管会主任粟裕将军任主席，参加者尚有人民市政府副市长柯庆施、中共南京市委会副书记唐亮、及各民主党派和文化界代表李方训、吴贻芳、徐养秋、陈中凡，少数民族代表杨毅，工商界代表宁聘卿及警备南京的人民解放军、工人和学生代表等。粟裕将军在向孙中山遗像献花后，即发表简短的演说。他在讲演中指出：孙中山先生奔走革命四十年来，领导辛亥革命推翻满清专制政体，结束了中国三千年来的君主专政，是有其伟大贡献的。孙中山先生在四十年的革命过程中几经失败，直到他看到十月革命的胜利成功，才找到了明确的方向，决定“以俄为师”，订定了联俄、联共、扶助工农三大政策。他接着愤慨地说：自一九二五年孙中山先生逝世后，蒋介石匪帮集团即背叛了孙中山先生的正确主张，叛卖了人民；而中国共产党则继续领导中国人民进行了英勇的斗争，取得了今天的胜利。他着重指出：孙中山先生在遗书上所嘱咐的中苏“两国同盟者必须手携手的走向胜利”的理想，由于中国共产党的领导中国人民英勇奋斗的结果，今天已经实现了。他最后号召大家将革命进行到底，彻底解放全中国，巩固人民胜利的成果。辞毕，粟裕将军即领导全体代表瞻仰灵衬。
