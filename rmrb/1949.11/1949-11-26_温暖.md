    Comrade Gengsheng's quilt has been used for several years, and it is so tattered that it can no longer be sewn together. The management department replaced it with a new quilt.
    However, just one quilt is not enough to get through the winter, and the comrades were afraid he would be cold, so they all tried to find ways to help him. Comrade Xiuzheng sent him a sheet a few days ago, and Comrade Luanke also wanted to give him his mattress to lay on. He didn't want it, because Comrade Luanke's bedding was also scarce, and he thought to himself: last winter, he stayed in an old farmer's house in the countryside that was drafty on all sides, and he got through the winter with only one quilt. This year, he's staying in the city, the house is warmer than before, and the quilt has been replaced with a new one, and there's a sheet to lay on, so it's not a problem. Of course, he was very grateful for Comrade Luanke's revolutionary friendship.
    Time passed day by day, and the weather gradually became colder. On the night of November 13th, he felt soft and warm when he slept on the bed, unlike usual nights; but he didn't pay attention to it and went to sleep. The next day, the weather was very good, and he wanted to air out his quilt and sheet. When he lifted the sheet, there was a mattress underneath. His heart was beating fast, where did it come from?! He stared at the mattress and thought for a long time, and he understood that this was the concern of his comrades in the revolutionary big family.
    In the evening, everyone returned to the dormitory from the office, and they were reading as usual. Suddenly, he thought of this matter, and shouted: "Luanke!" Comrade Luanke was pondering a problem, and asked in a low voice: "What's the matter?" He was so grateful that he didn't know what to say. After a long pause, he finally said a sentence: "I have invisibly increased my warmth."

　　温暖

    更生同志的被子已经盖了好几年了，里里面面都破烂不堪，不能再缝成一块。管理部门给他换了一床新被子。
    但是，只是一床被子过冬还是不够的，同志们怕他冻着，都为他想办法。修正同志前些天送了他一条单子，栾克同志也要把自己的褥子给他铺，他没有要，因为栾克同志的铺盖也很少，并且他自己想：去年冬天驻在乡村里的一个四面透风的老乡家里，光一床被子还过了冬。今年驻到城市里，房子比过去暖，被子又换成了新的，又有一条铺的单子，已不成问题了。当然他对栾克同志这种革命友爱精神是十分感激的。
    时间一天天的过去了，天气也渐渐的冷了，十一月十三日那晚，他睡在床上觉得软绵绵的，温度也与平常晚上不一样；但他并没有留意，便睡觉了。第二天天气很好，他要晒晒被子和单子，当他把单子揭起来时，下面铺着一条褥垫。他的心在跳动了，那里来的？！他瞅着褥垫想了大半天，心里明白了，这是革命的大家庭中，同志对他的关心。
    晚上都从办公处回到了宿舍，大家照常读书，忽然他想起了这件事，便喊了声：“栾克！”栾克同志正在思索着问题，低声的问：“什么事？”他感激的不知说什么好，停了好久，才说出一句话：“我无形中增加了温暖。”
