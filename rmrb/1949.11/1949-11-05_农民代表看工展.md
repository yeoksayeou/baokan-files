　　Peasant Representatives Visit the Industrial Exhibition
    Chen Ji
    This time, the Tianjin Municipal Authorities invited one thousand peasant representatives from various provinces in North China to Tianjin to visit the Tianjin Industrial Exhibition. These peasant representatives are the judges of Tianjin's industrial production, representing all the peasants of North China to choose the industrial products they need.
    The World Building, towering beside Xinhua North Road in Tianjin, is receiving the heroes who fought for China's victory for the first time in history. When the first group of over three hundred peasant representatives from Hebei Province appeared on the streets of Tianjin from the World Building, tens of thousands of eyes looked at them, waving to welcome them. As soon as they were spotted by workers at the telecommunications bureau standing next to the Industrial Exhibition venue, the cry "Peasant representatives are here!" echoed throughout the venue. The people standing in front of the venue immediately made way, warmly welcoming them. Tianjin Mayor Huang Jing said enthusiastically, "This time, Tianjin is holding an industrial exhibition, please inspect it. We hope you will offer many suggestions, and we will definitely improve and develop according to what you say." The brilliance of victory shone on the faces of the peasant representatives, and joyful laughter burst out from time to time. The Chinese peasants, who had been oppressed by feudalism for three thousand years, have stood up, entered the cities, and joined forces with the Chinese workers. The construction of the new China will advance rapidly on the basis of the worker-peasant alliance.
    Today, it is the workers who welcome the peasants. Workers from the Zhonghua Match Factory and the Dongya Tobacco Factory presented their products to the peasants as a gift for their first meeting. Wherever the peasant representatives went, the workers there greeted them with brotherly friendship. When three peasant representatives from Hengshui Prefecture appeared in the Steel Machinery Exhibition Hall, workers from the Tianjin Steel Plant quickly ran to them and led them to see the steelmaking process. In front of the huge oil painting "Pouring Steel in front of the Open Hearth Furnace," the peasants saw the red steel liquid flowing out of the huge furnace, and a dozen workers were reddened by the fire. They grabbed the worker who led them and said, "You are working hard enough!" The workers replied in unison, "Don't mention it! You are the ones working hard!" The peasants couldn't stop smiling at the slogan "Making Steel into Farm Tools." Peasant representative Zhao Lirong took out a pencil and wrote the following words on the suggestion book: "For generations, our ancestors have used simple plows and harrows to cultivate the land for thousands of years, and production has been too difficult. Today, with you making machines for us, our production prospects will change, and we pay our respects to you."
    The products of the North China Agricultural Machinery Factory were most attractive to the peasant representatives. Twenty or thirty peasants looked at them for a full two hours. More than four hundred copies of brochures about the agricultural machinery were snatched up by the peasants in less than half an hour. They carefully inquired about how to use each farm tool, how much manpower it required, how efficient it was, and how much it cost. Representative Dong Huimin, on behalf of eight peasants, said to the exhibition staff of the factory: "That single-handled plow, double-handled plow, and weeder are very suitable. The price is low, and we hope you can produce more of them." They requested the North China Agricultural Machinery Factory to bring these models to the countryside for exhibition, send more people, and print more brochures to tell the peasants how to use them. They also hoped that these new-style farm tools would be introduced more in the newspapers. They told reporters: "These farm tools are too necessary for us. We can guarantee that the peasants will buy them." The peasants pointed to the tractor, read the instructions on it, and discussed: "If this thing can be used in our village, that would be great." They were very interested in electric water suction irrigation. Watching the model of the electric waterwheel sending an endless stream of clear water into the ditches in the middle of the farmland, they nodded in unison and said it was good, and were unwilling to leave for a long time.
    Peasants regard fertilizer as important as eating. The area around the fertilizer powder displayed by the Yongli Chemical Industrial Company was crowded with peasant representatives. They asked what ingredients this fertilizer powder contained, how many kilograms were needed per mu, and what kind of soil was suitable for this fertilizer. After they learned about the situation of the fertilizer, they asked again: "How much does it cost per kilogram to buy?" When they heard the answer "More than three thousand yuan per kilogram," they quickly said, "We can't afford it! Soybean cake is only more than one hundred yuan per kilogram!" They hoped that the price of chemical fertilizers could be reduced. When talking about bone meal fertilizer, they also thought it was too expensive, but they suggested exchanging it for their cow and sheep bones. They said: "There are many cow and sheep bones in Handan and Hengshui. In recent years, no one has bought them, and they have piled up too much." They hoped that Tianjin's chemical companies would send people to buy them as soon as possible. Liu Shilin from Hengshui Prefecture believed that the supply of cow and sheep bones from the countryside to the city, in addition to extracting oil, could also be processed to make other products.
    Every time the peasant representatives visited an exhibition room, they took some samples and brochures of the products. Li Mengbi, a representative from Handan, smiled and pointed to the samples and discussed with his partner: "What we want are cheap and good quality goods." They recorded the names of all industrial products related to the countryside and the places where they were produced. They said to me: "We represent the peasants to look at the goods. We will take the good goods back and tell our brothers." They paid great attention to the various dyes on display, and many people wrote down the names and trademarks.
    In the exhibition room of export products, they were all nervously copying the types of export goods. "Wool, chicken feathers, peach kernels, duck feathers... can all be exported." Huai Yannian from Anping County said: "We produce these things in our area, but compared with what you display, it is slightly worse. I will take the specimens here back to use as a model for our production." When they heard that small red beans, black beans, mung beans, etc. were all important export products, they jumped up with joy and quickly patted the shoulders of the exhibition staff comrades and said: "We will go back and tell the people in our village to produce more of these things." Ma Xingzhi from Shen County wrote several big characters in the suggestion book: "Call on peasants to produce more local products and buy back machines." The folks from Ding County saw these local products and quickly sent a peasant named An Pingding to write the following opinion in the suggestion book: "We produce a lot of these things in our area, but we just can't transport them out. We hope that the trade companies will set up more purchasing points in the villages, buy in large quantities and transport in large quantities, saving money and convenience." (Attached pictures)

　　农民代表看工展
    陈迹
    这一次天津市当局邀请了华北各省一千位农民代表来津，参观天津工业展览会。这些农民代表是天津工业生产的评判者，他们代表了华北全体农民来选择他们所需要的工业品。
    高耸在天津新华北路旁的世界大楼，有史以来第一次接待着争取中国胜利的功臣们。当首批到津的河北省三百多位农民代表从世界大楼出现在天津市街头时，千万双眼晴向着他们，招手欢迎；在他们刚刚被站在工展会场旁边的电信局工人发现时，“农民代表来了”的声音立刻响澈整个会场。站在会场前面的人随即让出了位置，热烈欢迎他们。天津市黄敬市长热情地说：“这次津市举行工业展览，请你们检阅一下，希望你们多提意见，我们一定按照你们所说的去改进与发展。”胜利的光彩闪耀在农民代表的脸上，欢悦的笑声不时地发了出来。三千年来受着封建主义压迫的中国农民翻身了，走进了城市，和中国工人会合了，新中国的建设将在工农联盟的基础上迅速前进。
    今天是工人来欢迎农民。中华火柴厂和东亚烟草厂的工人拿出他们的生产品赠给农民，作为初次见面的礼物。农民代表们走到那里，那里的工人都以兄弟的友谊来接待他们。当衡水专区的三位农民代表出现在钢铁机械展览馆时，天津炼钢厂的工人连忙跑到他们面前，引他们参观制钢的情景。在“马丁炉前浇钢”的巨幅油画的前面，农民们看见了红色的钢液从那个庞大的炉中流溢出来，十几个工人被火映得发红。他们拉着那引他们来的工人说道：“你们够辛苦了”；工人们齐声答道：“那里的话！你们才辛苦呢！”农民们向着“把钢铁造成农具”的标语，笑得合不起嘴。农民代表赵立荣拿出了铅笔，在那张意见簿上写了下面几句话：“我们好几辈祖先用着简陋的梨耙，耕了千来年的地，生产太困难了；今天有了你们给咱们做机器，咱们的生产光景就要改变了，咱们向你们致敬。”
    华北农业机械厂的生产品最能吸引农民代表，二三十个农民在那里整整看了两个钟头。四百多份机器农具的介绍书不到半小时就被农民们索光了。他们仔细地询问着每个农具怎样用法；需要多少人力，有多大的效率，价钱要多少…董惠民代表了八位农民向该厂展览的工作同志说：“那个单把犁、双把犁和锄草机太合用了，价钱低廉，希望你们多生产一些。”他们要求华北农业机械厂把这些模型能够带到农村去展览，多派一些人，多印一些说明书，告诉农民怎样使用。他们还希望在报纸上多多介绍这些新式农具。他们对记者说：“这些农具对我们太需要了，我们可以保证农民一定会购买它们。”农民们指着拖拉机，念着上面的说明文，并议论道：“这家伙能用到咱们村里去，那就好哪。”他们对电力吸水灌溉很感兴趣。看着模型上电力水车把不尽的清流送进农田中间的沟渠，一致点头说好，长时不愿离去。
    农民把肥料看如吃饭似的重要，在永利化学工业公司陈列的肥田粉的周围，挤满着农民代表。他们问道，这种肥田粉包含些什么成份？一亩地要多少斤？什么土地适用这种肥料？他们知道了这种肥料的情形以后，又说：“要多少钱买一斤呀？”当他们听到了“三千多元一斤”的回答，连忙说：“咱们买不起呵！豆饼才一百多块钱一斤呢！”他们希望化学肥料的价钱减低些。谈到骨粉肥料，他们也以为太贵了，不过他们建议以他们的牛骨羊骨来交换。他们说：“邯郸、衡水一带多牛骨羊骨，这些年来，没人去收买，堆积得太多了。”他们希望天津的化学公司赶紧派人前往购买。衡水专署的刘世伦认为农村的牛羊骨供给城市，除了取油而外；加工之后，还可以做其他用品。
    农民代表们每参观一个展览室，都拿了一些生产品的样品和说明书。邯郸的代表李梦笔嘻笑着脸，指着样品和他的伙伴议论着：“咱们要的是价廉物美的物品。”他们记载着凡是与农村有关的工业品的名称及其出产的地点。他们对我说：“我们代表了农民来看货，我们把好货带回去告诉我们的兄弟。”他们对于展览的各种各样的染料非常注意，许多人记下名称和商标。
    在出口产品的展览室里，他们都紧张地抄写着出口物的种类。“羊毛、鸡毛、桃仁、鸭毛……都能出口呵。”安平县的槐延年说道：“我们那儿盛产这些东西，但是和你们陈列的比较，稍为差一点，我把你们这里的标本，带回去做为我们生产的模样。”他们听说小豆、黑豆、绿豆等都是重要的出口物，他们高兴得跳起来，连忙拍着展览会职员同志的肩膀说：“我们回去，告诉我们村里人，要他们多多生产这些东西。”深县的马行之在意见簿写了几个大字：“号召农民多生产土货，买回机器。”定县的老乡们看见了这些土货，连忙推派一个名叫安平定的农民在意见簿上写下了下面的意见：“这些东西我们那儿出产很多，就是运不出去。我们希望贸易公司多在乡村设几个购买所，大批的买，大批的运，省钱方便。”（附图片）
