The people from all circles in Beijing
　Unanimously Support Foreign Minister Zhou's Statement
　The United Nations Should Immediately Accept the Just Demands of the Chinese People
　[This newspaper dispatch] Beijing workers resolutely support the statement issued to the United Nations by Foreign Minister Zhou on the 15th. Wu Ziming, a worker from the 70th Arsenal, said: "Jiang Tingfu's delegation is a tool of the remnants of the Kuomintang bandit gang and has no right to represent China at all. Of course, we do not recognize him." Tao Shuyuan, a female telephone operator at the No. 2 Telephone Bureau, said: "The representatives of the Kuomintang reactionaries are a small group of anti-people exiles. Not only do we resolutely refuse to recognize them, but we should immediately send representatives of the Chinese people."
　[This newspaper dispatch] The students of the New Literature and Art Society of Peking University, after reading Foreign Minister Zhou's statement, all believe: "This shows that a powerful new force has been added to the world's peace camp." Students from the Economics, Western Language, and Russian departments believe that the "delegation" of the Kuomintang reactionary remnant government has no right to represent China at all. They steal the name of the Chinese people, clamor after their American and British masters in the United Nations, provoke wars, slander the Soviet Union and the world's peaceful democratic camp, and undermine world security and peace, which is really intolerable for the Chinese people. Foreign Minister Zhou's statement fully conforms to the will of all the Chinese people.
　The above-mentioned departments have also suggested that the student union issue a declaration in support of Foreign Minister Zhou's solemn statement on behalf of the Chinese people, and request the student union to suggest that the All-China Students' Federation send a telegram to the United Nations to cancel all the rights of the Kuomintang reactionary remnant government's "delegation" to participate in the United Nations.
　[This newspaper dispatch] The teachers and students of Tsinghua University were very excited after hearing Foreign Minister Zhou's statement to the United Nations General Assembly. In a collective discussion, the students of the Geography Group of the Department of Earth Sciences unanimously believed that this statement is a test of whether the United Nations can truly maintain world peace. Zhang Jiaji, a student from the Physics Department, said: "This statement is a statement of the broad masses of the people. The Kuomintang has long been destroyed throughout the country. It has long been spurned by all patriotic democrats and has no qualifications whatsoever to represent the Chinese people."
　[This newspaper dispatch] After the statement by Foreign Minister Zhou of the Central People's Government demanding that the United Nations immediately cancel all the rights of the Kuomintang bandit gang delegation to participate in the United Nations was published, the Normal University Communications Group and Broadcasting Group broadcast the entire statement by Foreign Minister Zhou and the People's Daily editorial during lunch yesterday (the 16th). The whole dining hall immediately became excited. In the afternoon, the Russian Group of the Foreign Language Department, History 1, History 2, and Chinese 2 departments expressed their full support for Foreign Minister Zhou's statement.
　Fu Huating, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce, said: The Chinese people's resolution of the war has achieved a decisive victory throughout the country. The Kuomintang reactionary remnant government has essentially collapsed. The so-called "representatives" attending this session of the United Nations General Assembly are only representatives of a small group of exiles. The people do not want such representatives. Therefore, Foreign Minister Zhou's statement is not only supported by our fellow industrialists and businessmen, but also by all the Chinese people and the people of the world.
　Pu Jiexiu, head of the Beijing Industrial Association, said: "Foreign Minister Zhou's statement to the United Nations is exactly what the Chinese people have long wanted to solemnly declare to the world. The Kuomintang reactionary remnant government has no right to represent China; if there is still such a thing as the so-called "Chinese Kuomintang government delegation" at the United Nations meeting, that is a fraudulent act; the only representative of the Chinese people is the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China."

### 北京市各界人民　一致拥护周外长声明  联合国应即接受中国人民严正要求

　　北京市各界人民
  　一致拥护周外长声明
    联合国应即接受中国人民严正要求
    【本报讯】北京工人坚决拥护外交部周部长十五日向联合国发出的声明。七十兵工厂一所工人吴子明说；“蒋廷黻这个代表团是国民党匪帮残余的御用工具，根本无权代表中国，我们当然不承认他。”电话二局女话务员陶树媛说：“国民党反动派的代表是一小撮反人民的流亡分子，我们不仅坚决不承认他们，我们应该立即派遣中国人民的代表。”
    【本报讯】北大新文艺社的同学看到周外长的声明都认为：“这就表示在全世界和平阵营中增加了一支强大的生力军。”经济、西语、俄文等系级同学认为国民党反动残余政府的“代表团”根本无权代表中国。他们盗窃中国人民的名义，在联合国内跟着美英主子叫嚣，挑拨战争，污蔑苏联及世界和平民主阵营，破坏世界的安全与和平，实在使中国人民难以容忍。周外长的声明完全符合全中国人民的意志。
    上述系级并已建议学生会发表宣言拥护周外长代表中国人民的庄严声明，并请学生会建议全国学联通电联合国取消国民党反动残余政府“代表团”参加联合国的一切权利。
    【本报讯】清华大学的师生听到周外长向联合国大会的声明后，都很兴奋。地学系地理组同学在集体讨论中，一致认为这个声明是对联合国能否真正维护世界和平的一个考验。物一章家骥同学说：“这一个声明是广大人民的声明，国民党在全国范围内已早灭亡，它早为一切爱国民主人士所唾弃，自无代表中国人民的丝毫资格。”
    【本报讯】中央人民政府周外长要求联合国立即取消国民党匪帮代表团参加联合国的一切权利的声明发表后，师大通讯组与广播组于昨日（十六日）利用午饭时间将周外长的声明与人民日报的社论全部播出。全饭厅空气马上兴奋起来。下午，外一俄文组、史一、史二、中二等系级，纷纷表示全力支持周外长的声明。
    市工商业联合会筹委会主任委员傅华亭说：中国人民的解决战争在全国范围内取得决定性的胜利，国民党反动残余政府实质上已经溃灭，出席本届联合国大会的所谓“代表”只是一小部分流亡分子的代表，人民不要这样的代表。因此，周外长的声明不仅我们工商界同人所共拥护，也是全中国人民及全世界人民所拥护的。
    北京市工业会负责人浦洁修说：“周外长向联合国的声明，正是中国人民早想向全世界郑重表白的话。国民党反动残余政府，无权代表中国；如果联合国会议上，仍发现有所谓“中国国民政府代表团”的事情，那是招摇撞骗的勾当；现在的中国，只有中华人民共和国中央人民政府，才是中国人民的唯一代表。
