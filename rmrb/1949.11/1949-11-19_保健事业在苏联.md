　　Healthcare in the Soviet Union
    Translated by Lü Pinjie

    The people's healthcare is one of the most concerning causes for the Communist Party and the Soviet government. The Soviet Union is the only country in the world that serves all the people with free and supreme medical skills. Due to the establishment of the socialist system, healthcare has become a basic right of the people.
    The funding for healthcare is increasing year by year. Although the restoration of many cities, villages, industries, and transportation systems destroyed in the war was very arduous, the Soviet government still stipulated in the budget for people's healthcare that 18,900,000,000 rubles would be used in 1947, 20,500,000,000 rubles in 1948, and 12,600,000,000 rubles in 1949.
    In addition, a large amount of funds were drawn from the social insurance fund for people's healthcare. Trade unions have established many good sanatoriums, rest homes, children's sanatoriums, Young Pioneer summer camps, and forest health resorts, which are provided to the people free of charge. The cost of various social insurance programs amounted to 17,500,000,000 rubles in 1949.
    In the Soviet Union, all employed people abide by and benefit from the social insurance system. The management and use of the social insurance fund are in the hands of the workers themselves, and have been fully trusted by the government and trade unions.
    The Soviet system of social insurance is genuinely democratic. It is fundamentally different from the social insurance systems of capitalist countries.
    Even during the Great War, the Soviet medical and epidemic prevention agencies never closed. When the war had just ended, the large and small hospitals, medical examination and treatment centers, and sanatoriums destroyed by the enemy were quickly repaired, and a large number of medical institutions were also restored.
    The steadily rising living standards of the Soviet people, the long-term development of healthcare, and the high level of physical exercise and sports have greatly reduced, and even eradicated, diseases and epidemics. In the era of Tsarist Russia, the prevalence of malignant infectious diseases killed thousands of precious lives, but now this phenomenon has been completely eliminated.
    Therefore, it is obvious that one can imagine the growth and development of Soviet medical institutions. In terms of the number of beds in urban and rural hospitals, the number in 1949 was more than six times that of 1913, while the number of hospitals and clinics in cities increased twentyfold.
    In Tsarist Russia, there were only 4,472 medical stations in rural border areas, but today there are 15,542 rural medical centers and 51,464 rural hospitals and clinics. In the Tsarist era, there was not a single rural medical station in Moldavia, but now there are 783.
    The fact that the lives of the Soviet collective farm people have improved is reflected in rural medical services, that is, the vast population of collective farms has received care from various specialist doctors. If any difficult or complicated cases occur in remote rural areas, they can be treated by specialist doctors who come from the city by medical plane.
    No country cares for and takes care of children and mothers as much as the Soviet Union. Here, there are 6,416 mother and child healthcare cores; 5,993 urban and rural hospitals, and more than 5,000 hospitals run by collective farms; 18,345 permanent and temporary seasonal nurseries; 3,571 children's dietary supply centers and a vast network of medical institutions, all of which provide free services for mothers and children.
    In terms of training medical personnel, the Soviet Union surpasses all other countries. At present, there are more than 200,000 specialist doctors and thousands of assistant doctors and nurses in the Soviet Union. This huge number of medical workers is unparalleled by any other country.
    Doctors and nurses are generally valued by the government, the Communist Party, and society in the Soviet Union. Their services are loved and praised. Many people have been commended for their public activities or for their particularly good discoveries in their positions. At the same time, more than 3,000 people have won the honorary doctorate title of the Republic, and more than 100 people have been awarded the Stalin Prize for valuable medical discoveries or improvements in medical methods.
    The achievements of Soviet medicine were proven in the Second World War. Thanks to the medical personnel's dedication to their careers and high level of medical knowledge, more than 72 percent of the soldiers, sailors, and airmen recovered their health and returned to their posts. At the front, 90 percent of the symptoms could be completely cured, allowing patients to return to their combat duties like healthy people.
    The theoretical research of Soviet medicine is closely related to practical learning. Medical research institutions have clinical internship professor classes. Doctors from all over the country can enrich their knowledge and experience under the guidance of outstanding professors and researchers. Professors and lecturers of medical specialty schools often go to border areas for investigation and practice to help local doctors solve difficult and complicated diseases and perform operations.
    A few years ago, in order to study advanced medical principles and healthcare practices, the government decided to establish the Soviet Academy of Medical Sciences. It has 26 research institutes and four experimental halls.
    Soviet medical scientists are inheriting the glorious traditions of outstanding Russian medical masters such as Pirogov, Pavlov, Sechenov, Botkin, Mechnikov, Gamaleya and their many students. To promote and develop the medicine of their motherland with new and valuable inventions and contributions. (Excerpted from "Soviet Construction" No. 7, 1949)

### 保健事业在苏联

　　保健事业在苏联
    吕品节译
    人民的保健事业，是共产党和苏维埃政府最为关切的事业之一。苏联是在世界上唯一以免费的最高医术来为全体人民服务的国家。由于社会主义制度的建立，保健已经成了人民的一种基本权利了。
    用于保健事业的经费是年有增加。虽然许多在战争中遭破毁的城市、乡村、工业和运输的修复工作是非常的艰巨，但苏联政府对于人民保健事业仍在预算中规定了，要在一九四七年用一八、九○○、○○○、○○○卢布，一九四八年用二○、五○○、○○○、○○○卢布，和一九四九年用一二、六○○、○○○、○○○卢布。
    此外，还从社会保险基金里面提出大批款项用于人民保健。职工会设立了许多良好的疗养院、休息所、儿童疗养院、少先夏令营和林带健康休养院，免费供给人民享用。各种社会保险事业的费用，在一九四九年计达一七、五○○、○○○、○○○卢布。
    在苏联，所有职业人民，都遵守而且受益于社会保险制度。社会保险基金的管理及运用，是操在工人们自己手里，而且已经得到了政府及职工会的充分信任。
    社会保险的苏维埃制度，是真诚民主的。它与资本主义国家的社会保险制度在本质上是全然不同的。
    即是在大战期间，苏联的医务与防疫机关也未曾停闭过。当战争刚刚结束时，被敌人所毁坏的大小医院、医务检治所和疗养院马上就很快地修复了，而且大量的医事机关也恢复了。
    稳步向上直升的苏联人民生活水准，和长久发展的保健事业，以及身体锻炼与运动的达于高度的水平，使得疾病和疫疠大大地减少了，甚至是灭绝了。在帝俄时代，恶性传染病的流行，曾经卷杀了万千人的宝贵生命，然而在现在，这种现象早已完全消灭了。
    因此，很明显地可以想象得到苏联医务机构的成长和发展。就以城市和乡间医院的病床数目来说，一九四九年比一九一三年增加到六倍以上之多，而在城市的医院和诊疗所却增加了二十倍。
    在帝俄时，农村边塞地区，仅有四、四七二个医药站，而今天却有一五、五四二个农村医务中心和五一、四六四个农村医院与诊疗所。帝俄时代在摩达维亚就没有一个农村医药站，可是现在却有七八三个。
    苏维埃集体农庄人民生活改善的事实，是可以在农村医务里反映出来的，那就是集体农场的广大人口均得到了各种专门医师的照顾。如果在边远的乡区发生了什么疑难大症，那么很可以得到从城市乘医疗飞机来的专门医师的救治。
    没有一个国家是象苏联这样的关心和照顾儿童及母亲们的。在这里，有六、四一六个母亲和儿童诊疗核心；五、九九三个城乡医院，另外还有集体农庄经办的五、○○○多所医院；一八、三四五所永久的和临时的季节性的托儿所；三、五七一个儿童饮食供应中心站与广大的医务机构网，这些设施均免费地为母亲和儿童们服务。
    在医事人员的训练上，苏联胜过所有的其他国家。目前在苏联有二十多万的专门医生和万千的助理医生及护士。这庞大的医务工作者数字，是没有任何国家可与比拟的。
    医生和护士在苏联受到了政府、共产党和社会的普遍重视。他们的服务受到了爱戴和赞扬。许多人因了他们的公共活动或在其岗位上有了特殊优良的发现而受到了褒奖。同时也有三千多人赢得了共和国的荣誉博士头衔，更有一百多人因了有价值的医学发现，或医疗方法的改进而荣膺了斯大林奖金。
    在二次大战中证明了苏维埃医学的成就。由于医务人员的忠于事业和高度的医学知识水准，使得百分之七十二以上的海陆空军战士恢复了健康，而重回到岗位上去。在前线百分之九十的症状，都能完全的医疗好，而使得病人能象健康人一样去恢复他们的战斗职务。
    苏联医学的理论研究，是与实际学习有着密切联系的。医学研究机构设有临诊实习教授班。来自各地的医生们，可以在卓越教授和研究员的指导下，丰富他们的学识经验。医科专门学校的教授讲师，经常地到边塞的地区去考察实习，帮助当地的医生解决疑难病症和施行手术。
    几年前，为了研究高深医学原理和保健的实习，政府决定创设了苏联医学研究院。在这里面设有二十六个研究所和四个实验馆。
    苏联医学家正继承着俄罗斯杰出医科圣手彼洛葛夫、巴夫洛夫、塞琴诺夫、泡特金、米琴尼可夫、贾马莱亚和他们的许多学子的光荣传统。以新的有价值的发明和贡献来发扬光大他们的祖国医学。（节译自“苏联建设”一九四九年第七期）
