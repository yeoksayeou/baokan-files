　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 26th. The Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government has recently issued instructions on carrying out New Year picture work. The full text of the instructions is as follows: To the cultural and educational departments of local governments:
　　New Year pictures are one of the most popular forms of Chinese folk art. Under feudal rule, New Year pictures were once a tool for spreading feudal ideology. Since 1942, when Chairman Mao called on literary and art workers in his speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art to use old literary and art forms to engage in literary and art popularization movements, art workers in various old liberated areas have achieved considerable success in transforming old New Year pictures to spread the ideas of people's democracy. New Year pictures have been proven to be an artistic form that is loved by the people and is rich in educational significance.
　　Now that the Spring Festival is approaching, this is the first Spring Festival after the founding of the People's Republic of China. Cultural and educational institutions and groups in various regions should take the development of New Year picture work as one of the important tasks in this year's Spring Festival cultural and educational publicity work. This year's New Year pictures should promote the great victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War and the People's Great Revolution, promote the founding of the People's Republic of China, promote the Common Program, promote carrying the revolutionary war through to the end, and promote the recovery and development of industrial and agricultural production. New Year pictures should focus on portraying the new and happy struggle life of the working people and their heroic and healthy images. Technically, we must fully utilize folk forms and strive to suit the appreciation habits of the broad masses. In printing, we must avoid extravagance, reduce costs, take into account the purchasing power of the masses, and avoid excessively high prices. In terms of distribution, we must make use of the distribution network of old New Year pictures (incense shops, small book stalls, peddlers, etc.) to strive for a broad market for New Year pictures. In some areas where New Year art forms such as "Door God" paintings and calendar posters are popular, attention should also be paid to utilizing and transforming these forms so that they become tools for the new art popularization movement.
　　In order to widely carry out New Year picture work, the cultural and educational departments of local governments and literary and art organizations should mobilize and organize new art workers to engage in New Year picture production, telling them that this is an important and widely effective artistic work, and opposing the tendency of some art workers to despise this kind of popularization work. In addition, we should also focus on cooperating with the old New Year picture industry and folk painters, giving them the necessary ideological education and material assistance, providing them with new paintings, enabling them to carry out transformation in their business, and enabling New Year pictures to be widely promoted through them.

　　中央人民政府文化部关于开展新年画工作的指示
    【新华社北京二十六日电】中央人民政府文化部顷发布关于开展新年画工作的指示。指示全文如下：各地政府文教部门：
    年画是中国民间艺术中最流行的形式之一。在封建统治下，年画曾经是封建思想的传播工具，自一九四二年毛主席在延安文艺座谈会讲话号召文艺工作者利用旧文艺形式从事文艺普及运动以后，各老解放区的美术工作者，改造旧年画用以传播人民民主思想的工作已获得相当成绩，新年画已被证明是人民所喜爱的富于教育意义的一种艺术形式。
    现在春节快到，这是中华人民共和国成立后的第一个春节，各地文教机关团体，应将开展新年画工作作为今年春节文教宣传工作中重要任务之一。今年的新年画应当宣传中国人民解放战争和人民大革命的伟大胜利，宣传中华人民共和国的成立，宣传共同纲领，宣传把革命战争进行到底，宣传工农业生产的恢复与发展。在年画中应当着重表现劳动人民新的、愉快的斗争的生活和他们英勇健康的形象。在技术上，必须充分运用民间形式，力求适合广大群众的欣赏习惯。在印刷上，必须避免浮华，减低成本，照顾到群众的购买力，切忌售价过高。在发行上，必须利用旧年画的发行网（香炉店、小书摊、货郎担子等等），以争取年画的广大市场。在某些流行“门神”画、月份牌画等类新年艺术形式的地方，也应当注意利用和改造这些形式，使其成为新艺术普及运动的工具。　　
    为广泛开展新年画工作，各地政府文教部门和文艺团体应当发动和组织新美艺工作者从事新年画制作，告诉他们这是一项重要的和有广泛效果的艺术工作，反对某些美术工作者轻视这种普及工作的倾向。此外，还应当着重与旧年画行业和民间画匠合作，给予他们以必要的思想教育和物质帮助，供给他们新的画稿，使他们能够在业务上进行改造，并使新年画能够经过他们普遍推行。
