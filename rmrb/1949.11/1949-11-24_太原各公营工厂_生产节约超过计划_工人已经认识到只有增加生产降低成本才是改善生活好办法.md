　　State-Owned Factories in Taiyuan

　　Production and Savings Exceed Plans

　　Workers Realize Increased Production and Lower Costs are the Best Way to Improve Life

　　[Our Newspaper] In September and October, state-owned factories in Taiyuan continued their production and savings campaign, and many factories completed and exceeded their plans. The units that completed their production plans include: Northwest Iron and Steel Company (iron smelting, coke smelting, and steel rolling departments), the brick factory, the Industrial Chemical Company, Jinhua Textile Factory, the Paper Company, the Leather Factory, and Jinsheng Textile Factory, totaling seven units. Those that exceeded their production plans include: the First Power Plant, the Second Power Plant, Coal Mine No. 1, the Tobacco Company, and the Taiyuan Paper Mill. The greatest achievements in savings were made by the Northwest Iron and Steel Company (in October), saving more than 123,000 jin of rice in coal and machine oil. The Second Power Plant saved 67,790 kilograms of coal, the Printing Company (in forty-five days) saved 20,697 jin of rice, the Electric Power Company saved a total of 70,000 jin of rice, the Leather Factory saved 58,587 jin of rice, and the Industrial Chemical Company saved 27,711 jin of rice.
　　The reasons for completing and exceeding the plans are that the leadership paid attention to promoting democracy and absorbing the rational suggestions of the vast number of employees, turning the production and savings campaign into a conscious action of the employees. During the campaign, the leaders of each factory put forward the slogans "Increase wages without increasing costs" and "Increase wages by reducing waste," and mobilized and organized employees to discuss production and savings plans, formulate their own labor discipline and reward and punishment measures, etc., thus the employees put forward many good ways to improve production. For example, the Leather Factory adopted rationalized production standards, and wages were changed from hourly to piece rate; the Chemical Factory implemented a hierarchical responsibility system; the First and Second Power Plants implemented a dedicated responsibility system; the Tobacco Company proposed standard specifications and set up a system of regular meetings to check and summarize; the Lancun Paper Mill established a technical research association, in which engineers and all employees participated, which had a great effect on improving technology and ensuring the completion of production tasks. The Match Company implemented "Increase wages without increasing costs," producing 78 more boxes of matches using the same raw materials, increasing the income of employees by 1,300 jin of rice, without increasing costs. This made the workers realize that "Only by working hard in production and earnestly saving can we improve our lives."

　　太原各公营工厂
　　生产节约超过计划
　　工人已经认识到只有增加生产降低成本才是改善生活好办法
    【本报讯】太原各国营工厂在九、十月份，继续进行了生产节约运动，许多工厂完成并超过了计划。计完成生产计划的有：西北钢铁公司（炼铁、炼焦、碾钢三部）、窑厂、工业化学公司、晋华纺织厂、造纸公司、皮革厂、晋生纺织厂等七个单位。超过生产计划的有：第一发电厂、第二发电厂、煤矿一厂、烟草公司、太原造纸厂。在节约方面成绩最大的如西北钢铁公司（十月份）煤炭和机器油即节米十二万三千余斤，第二发电厂节约煤六万七千七百九十公斤，印刷公司（四十五天）节米二万零六百九十七斤，电力公司共节米七万斤，皮革厂节米五万八千五百八十七斤，工业化学公司节米二万七千七百一十一斤。
    完成与超过计划的原因是领导上注意了发扬民主、吸收广大职工合理建议，把生产节约运动变成了职工的自觉行动。运动中各厂领导上都提出：“增加工资不增加成本”、“从减少浪费中增加工资”的口号，并发动与组织职工讨论生产节约计划，自订劳动纪律与奖惩办法等，因而职工提出了许多改进生产的好办法。如皮革厂采用了合理化的生产标准，工资由计时改为计件；化学厂实行按级负责制；第一、第二发电厂实行专责制；烟草公司提出标准规格，并定出定期开会检查总结的制度；兰村纸厂建立了技术研究会，工程师与全体职工都参加，对于提高技术，保证生产任务的完成上收到了很大效果。火柴公司实行“增加工资不增加成本”，利用同样原料多产火柴七十八箱，给职工增加了一千三百斤小米，成本也未增加。这样使工人体验到：“只有努力生产，认真节约，才是改善自己生活的好办法。”。
