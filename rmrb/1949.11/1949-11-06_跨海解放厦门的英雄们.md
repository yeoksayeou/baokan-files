　　Heroes of the Cross-Sea Liberation of Xiamen

　　The Night of the Crossing
　　On the night of October 15th, under a sky filled with dark clouds, the brave soldiers of the People's Liberation Army's assault team surged over the coastal hills like a tide. They pushed their boats from the beach into the sea, quickly leaping aboard and forming a single line of battle. At 8:45 PM, the order for the general attack on Xiamen was given. In an instant, hundreds of small boats, like flying arrows, dashed towards Xiamen Island, cleaving through the waves. The sea wind whipped up startling waves, and the cabins filled with inches of seawater. The soldiers calmly untied their rice bowls from their waists and bailed the water out, bowl by bowl. After several tens of minutes of arduous and heroic struggle against the waves, the boats finally approached the coast of Xiamen. Hundreds of small boats docked on the shallow beaches, and the soldiers swiftly jumped out, wading ashore and spreading out in all directions. Enemy machine guns densely spat out tongues of fire at the beach, but the brave assault teams swiftly and cleverly broke through the enemy's barbed wire. At the same time, the People's Liberation Army's powerful artillery continuously destroyed five lines of enemy defenses, enabling the assault team to quickly seize the steel and concrete bunkers on the beachhead and open up a path for the assault to develop. The soldiers then used bamboo ladders to capture the enemy-occupied hilltops, completely controlling the high ground. At 9:45 PM, one hour after the attack order was given, red, blue, and white signal flares of successful landing soared into the sky above Xiamen City.
　　
　　The Red Light at the Breakthrough
　　Immediately after the signal flares of successful landing streaked across the night sky, a bright and dazzling red light, indicating the direction of the landing, appeared at the breakthrough point in the northwest corner of Xiamen. The red light emitted an unusual glow towards the sea, and hundreds of boats loaded with reinforcements sailed towards the light. The red glow of the guiding light greatly encouraged the soldiers, who were bravely advancing through the waves. The enemy's dense artillery fire from the Gaoqi Fortress continuously exploded near the red light, and enemy machine guns in the steel and concrete bunkers two hundred meters from the breakthrough point continuously spat out tongues of fire at the red light. Communist Party member Yao Huanxing, in order to complete the task assigned to him by his superiors and the Party: "Do not let the red light go out, guide the troops safely into the breakthrough," braved the flying shrapnel and repeatedly climbed to the top of the rocks to move the red light to a safe place where it could still illuminate the sea. When the rain cleared, and the moon rose into the sky, the red light was dimmed. The soldier guarding the light, fearing that the brothers on the boats would lose their way, disregarded the danger of being shot at and climbed back onto the protruding part of the rock, holding the red light high and waving it back and forth, guiding the soldiers fighting across the sea to row forward vigorously. The heroes on the water relied on the red light to distinguish the direction, one team following another, one row following another, rushing into the breakthrough point. The entire regiment of combat troops landed, the logistics work team landed, and the faces of the brave soldiers who protected the red light with their lives revealed smiles of victory.

　　The Artillery Team Clearing Obstacles
　　The artillery team, assisting the infantry landing from across the strait, ensured that where the infantry landed, the artillery shells would blast open a path. The artillery group commander continuously indicated the key points of attack over the telephone, and a barrage of shells accurately landed in the enemy's defensive works. The cannons of the bandit army in the Gaoqi Fortress were suppressed so much that they could not even breathe. The 5th Company of a certain regiment of the assault team was blocked outside the barbed wire near Gaoqi. Just as they were preparing to blow up the obstacles and advance, three artillery shells suddenly blasted the enemy's barbed wire and other obstacles to smithereens. The infantry, amid cheers, rushed through the enemy's solid front-line fortifications and controlled the entire beachhead. As they advanced deeper, the signals from the infantry requesting to extend the artillery fire pointed to where the shells blossomed. Many important defensive systems in the suburbs of Xiamen, such as bamboo forests and airports, were quickly destroyed by the firepower of the artillery heroes, and the infantry heroes quickly broke into the urban area. As the victory signals constantly soared into the sea and sky from all corners, the telephone at the artillery position continuously received praise from the brotherly infantry units on the other side, saying, "The support was really good."

　　The Brave Battlefield Boatmen
　　In this cross-sea operation, thousands of boatmen created countless heroic deeds. Chen Qishan, a boatman of the 6th Squad of the 2nd Company of the Assault Battalion, in order to speed up the ship's approach to the shore, fearlessly jumped into the sea when the ship was about to reach the shore. In the deep seawater and mud, he stubbornly pushed the ship forward fifty meters, enabling the soldiers to land safely and fight. When Chen Qishan turned the boat around to prepare to return to the north bank to transport reinforcements, he discovered that his right chest and left finger were injured, and blood was flowing non-stop. However, he still endured the pain and fought against the wind for two hours, driving the boat back to the Jimei Wharf, and immediately loaded another boatload of soldiers to cross the strait again. Another boat that was damaged by artillery fire was spinning back and forth in the sea. Boatman Gong Shichang jumped into the water with injuries, tested the depth of the seawater, and safely carried the soldiers to the beach one by one. Just as this arduous task was completed, another small boat carrying sixteen assault team members was hit by a shell in the deep water, and all the soldiers fell into the water. Gong Shichang forgot all the dangers and swam in the sea, thirty meters away from the enemy's dense firepower, and rescued all sixteen soldiers onto the boat, and detoured past the enemy's artillery blockade line and sent the soldiers to the shore. Countless boatmen, with such selfless spirit, victoriously completed the transportation tasks in the cross-sea liberation of Xiamen operation. [Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, 4th]

　　跨海解放厦门的英雄们
　　渡海之夜
    十月十五日乌云密布之夜，人民解放军突击队健儿们潮水似地翻过海岸上的山坡，把船只从沙滩上推下海去，迅速纵身上船，展开了一字形的战斗队。八点三刻正，对厦门的总攻击令下了。瞬息间，千百只小船飞箭似的向厦门岛破浪急进。海风掀起了惊涛骇浪，船舱里涌进了几寸深的海水，战士们镇静地解开腰间的饭碗，一碗一碗地把水掏出去。经过几十分钟与海浪艰苦英勇的搏斗，船只终于驶近厦门海岸了。千百只小船泊在浅海滩上，战士们急迅地跳下船去涉水向陆地纵横发展。敌人的机枪密集地向沙滩吐出火舌，英勇的突击队员们神速机智地突破了敌人的铁丝网。同时，人民解放军强大无比的炮火连续摧毁了敌人五道障碍防线，使突击队迅速夺取了滩头钢骨水泥碉堡，开辟了突击发展的道路。战士们紧接着用竹梯攻占了敌军盘据的小山头，全部控制了制高阵地。九点三刻，当攻击命令下达后的一个钟头，红、蓝、白三色胜利登陆的信号弹就飞升在厦门市的上空了。
　　突破口上的红灯
    紧接着胜利登陆信号弹掠过夜空之后，一盏指示登陆方向鲜明耀目的红灯，立刻出现在厦门西北角突破口上。红灯向海面发射出异样的光芒，千百只载满后援部队的船只向着灯光驶去。指挥灯红色的光芒，大大地鼓舞着海浪中颠簸着奋勇前进的战士。敌人高岐要塞密集的炮火不断地在红灯附近爆炸，突破口二百米外钢骨水泥碉里敌人的机枪亦不断地向红灯吐出火舌。共产党员姚焕兴为了完成上级和党交给他的任务：“不让红灯熄灭，照引部队安全进入突破口”，在弹片横飞中，几度爬上岩石顶，把红灯移到安全而又能照耀海面的地方。当雨过天晴月亮升上海空的时候，红色的灯光被冲淡了，守灯的战士怕船上的兄弟们迷失方向，不顾一切地冒着子弹射击的危险，重新爬上岩石突出处，高高擎红灯来回摇晃，指引着跨海作战的战士们奋力划桨前进。水上的英雄们就凭借着红光辩别方向，一班跟着一班、一排跟着一排地冲进突破口。全团战斗部队上岸了，后勤工作队上岸了，用生命保护红灯的英勇战士脸上流露出胜利的笑容。
　　扫清障碍的炮兵队
    隔岸协助步兵登陆的炮兵队，保证步兵在那里登陆、炮弹就在那里轰开一条道路。电话中炮群指挥员不停地指示攻击要点，连珠般的炮弹准确地落在敌人防御工事里。高岐要塞匪军的大炮被压得一点也透不出气来。突击队某团五连被阻于高岐附近铁丝网外，正准备爆破障碍前进的时候，突然三声炮弹，把敌人铁丝和其它障碍物轰得一干二净，步兵们就在一片欢呼声中冲过敌人坚固的前沿工事，控制了全部滩头阵地。向纵深发展的时候，步兵们要求延伸炮火的信号指向那里，炮弹就在那里开花。厦门城郊竹子林、飞机场等许多重要防御体系很快地被炮兵英雄们的火力摧毁了，步兵英雄们也就更快地突入了市区。当胜利信号从各个角落不断飞升在海空时，炮兵阵地的电话里接连传来对岸步兵兄弟部队一片“支援得真好”的赞扬声。
　　英勇的战地船工
    在这次渡海作战中，千百个船工创造了无数英勇的事迹。突击营二连六班的船工陈其山在船快到岸时，为了加快船身靠岸的速度，不顾一切地猛然跳下海去，在很深的海水淤泥里，顽强地把船迅速推行了五十米，使战士们安全登陆作战。陈其山调转船身准备回北岸载运后援部队时，才发现右胸和左手指受伤，血流不止。但是，他仍然忍痛在逆风中搏斗两小时，将船驾回集美码头，并且立即又装上一船战士再渡过海峡。另一只被炮轰伤的船在海中来回打旋，船工龚诗长带伤跳下水去，试好海水深浅，将战士一个一个地安全背上沙滩。这一艰巨工作刚结束，另一只载有十六个突击队员的小船又在海水深处被炮弹击中了，战士全部落水。龚诗长忘了一切危险，在三十米外敌人火力密集的海面上，泅水把十六个战士全部救上了船，并迂回过敌人的炮火封锁线把战士们送到岸边。无数的船工们就以这样忘我的精神在渡海解放厦门的作战中胜利地完成了运输任务，【新华社福建前线四日电】
