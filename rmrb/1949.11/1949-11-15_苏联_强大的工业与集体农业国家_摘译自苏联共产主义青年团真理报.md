USSR—A Powerful Industrial and Collective Agricultural Nation
—Excerpts from the Komsomolskaya Pravda—
Mikhailov

Our country could not have a strong industry and mechanized agricultural economy without its own machinery. It is precisely for this reason that we have developed machine manufacturing much faster than other industrial sectors. At the beginning of the Great Patriotic War, its production was fifty times higher than the level of 1913, and the production volume of Soviet machine manufacturing now ranks first in Europe. Lathe manufacturing is one of the USSR's leading industries, with large lathe manufacturing plants in the Moscow-Volga region, Ukraine, the Urals, and other regions. Pre-revolutionary Russia had only a small number of automobiles, most of which were imported. The Soviet Union has built a strong automobile industry. In Moscow, Gorky City, Yaroslavl (northeast of Moscow), and the Urals, there are huge automobile factories in operation, and new automobile factories are being built. By the end of the new Five-Year Plan, our industry will produce 500,000 cars a year. Tsarist Russia did not produce tractors, but now we have huge tractor factories, such as in Stalingrad, Kharkiv, Chelyabinsk, Altai, and other places. Our country has learned to manufacture any machinery and equipment needed by the national economy and the army with its own strength. There is now no machine that cannot be manufactured in the Soviet Union. By the end of the Five-Year Plan, machinery and equipment will increase to twice the pre-war level.

During the years of the Stalin Five-Year Plans, the Soviet Union built a huge chemical industry to produce fertilizers, acids, synthetic rubber, pigments, fiber products, and other products, and achieved great development.

The timber industry has also made progress. The degree of mechanization of the timber supply process is increasing year by year. Trees are sawn with the help of electricity, and trees cut down from the logging site to the road are transported to the river or railway station using tractors invented in the Soviet Union. Part of the timber is used for construction, and part is given to timber industry combines to manufacture parquet, matchsticks, spirits, and other chemical products. The Soviet Union has a series of powerful paper industry combines.

The development of heavy industry has made it possible for our country to significantly expand the use of new technical equipment. Light industry and the food industry supply an important part of the widely needed goods and nutrients. Our light industry is very extensive, including cotton weaving, wool weaving, linen weaving, silk reeling, hosiery, leather shoe industry, and others. During the years of the Stalin Five-Year Plan, all these industrial sectors built many new combines and factories. The food industry was almost entirely established under the Soviet regime and is built on a new and modern technical foundation. In terms of its equipment, it is not behind other industrial sectors in the Soviet Union. The great progress of light industry and the food industry, and the simultaneous progress of the agricultural economy, have made it possible for our country to increase the provision of widely needed goods and nutrients to the people year by year.

The powerful industry of the Soviet Union had already reached the pre-war level in 1947. In June 1949, the average daily output of its total industrial production had increased by 41 percent compared with the pre-war year of 1940. Now, a huge nationwide movement to complete the Five-Year Plan in four years is underway. Under the leadership of its Bolshevik Party, the Soviet people will achieve ever-increasing success in the development of industry.

(II) The Soviet Union—The Most Advanced Country in the World's Agricultural Economy

Now our agricultural economy has become the most powerful and advanced, based on modern technology, capable of applying all agricultural science and the most advanced Michurin science. This is the result of the great socialist transformation realized in our country under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party. The collective farm system is being strengthened in the Soviet countryside. The Soviet Union has been transformed from a country with small individual farming economies into a country with a powerful mechanized agricultural economy. The Soviet Union ranks first in the world in mechanized agricultural economy production. In 1940, there were 530,000 tractors, 182,000 combine harvesters, and 228,000 trucks working on our land, and there were more than 7,000 tractor stations. The application of machinery and new agricultural technologies in agricultural production in rural areas has not only increased the harvest volume of our land, but also guaranteed the development of agricultural products. Before the start of the Great Patriotic War, the Soviet Union could harvest more than 7 billion poods (each pood equals 32.76 market catties) of grain a year, while the agricultural economy of Tsarist Russia could only harvest 400 million to 500 million poods. During the years of the post-war Five-Year Plan, the socialist agricultural economy received no less than 325,000 tractors and a large number of various agricultural machines, including self-propelled combine harvesters, electric tractors, giant harvesters, and other most modern machines. According to the goals of the new Five-Year Plan, 950 new tractor stations will be organized. The main task of our agricultural economy production belongs to the grain economy. The Soviet Union is one of the largest grain producers in the world. Wheat ranks first among grain crops, and its sowing accounts for almost one-third of the total cultivated area. The Soviet Union ranks first among all countries in terms of the area sown with wheat, and our wheat is known for its excellent quality. The Soviet Union's wheat planting base is located in the Black Soil Great Plains and forest areas, stretching in a continuous and narrow line from the eastern region to the western region, passing through Ukraine, the Don region, Kuban, the Middle Volga River region, the Southern Urals, Northern Kazakhstan, and Western Siberia. Rye, oats, and barley are widely planted on Soviet territory. Millet, rice, and corn also occupy an important position among grain crops.

Our country has many wheat and other grain crops, all planted in dry areas. In Tsarist Russia, drought was a terrible and unconquerable disaster for the small individual farming economy with ancient technology. In 1948, under the leadership of Comrade Stalin, an unprecedented drought prevention plan in human history was planned. It will build permanent forests, ponds, and reservoirs to protect the soil, so as to ensure bumper harvests in these dry areas every year. According to this great plan, huge national forest areas must be formed in the fifteen years from 1950 to 1965, especially on both sides and in the basins of the Volga River, the Ural River, the Don River, and the North Donets River. Some of these forest areas will be thousands of kilometers long. In addition, nearly 6 million hectares of vast forest areas will be built on the land of collective farms and state farms. Thanks to the work of the heroic collective farmers, the total grain harvest in 1948 was only slightly short of the pre-war level, and the average harvest of grain crops had exceeded the pre-war level. During the Stalin Five-Year Plan, the development of our agricultural supply to industrial raw materials was even faster than the production of grain crops. Cotton, which supplies fiber to the cotton textile industry, is one of the most important raw materials.

As a result of the increase in cotton fields and cotton harvest volume during the years of the Soviet regime, our cotton textile industry no longer needs to import raw cotton from foreign countries. Before the revolution, Russia purchased half of its cotton from the United States.

Cotton needs considerable temperature and grows in artificially irrigated land in the south. The main producing areas are Central Asia and Transcaucasia, Uzbekistan.

The Soviet Union has also strived to develop a series of horticulture, vineyard, and orchard areas.

Animal husbandry is also an important part of the agricultural economy. Compared with other agricultural economic sectors, animal husbandry is still relatively backward. Today, when significant victories have been won in grain economic production, making every effort to develop animal husbandry in all aspects has become the central task of the Party and the government in developing agriculture.

(III) The Soviet Union's Transportation Industry

The Soviet Union has a vast territory, so railways, waterways, highways, and aviation have special tasks. Railways occupy the most important position in our transportation industry. Comrade Stalin once said: "...The Soviet Union is unimaginable without first-class railway transportation that connects the numerous provinces and regions into one." In terms of the total length of railways, we rank second in the world. We are still constantly building railways. As early as the beginning of the Third Five-Year Plan, the Soviet Union's railways had increased by one and a half times compared with 1913, and the volume of railway transportation had increased by more than five times. In the post-war Stalin Five-Year Plan, great attention was paid to the restoration and forward development of our railway transportation. We will add powerful locomotives and new types of carriages, and will build 7,330 kilometers of new railways. When the Five-Year Plan is completed, the length of electrified railways will increase to 5,325 kilometers. The Soviet Union ranks first in the world in the length of electrified railways.

    苏联——强大的工业与集体农业国家
    ——摘译自苏联共产主义青年团真理报——
    米哈依洛夫
    我们国家如果没有自己的机器，就不可能有强大的工业和机械化的农业经济。也正因为这个原因，我们发展机器制造业比其他工业部门要迅速得多。在伟大爱国战争开始时，它的生产比一九一三年的水准要高出五十倍，苏联机器制造业的生产量现占欧洲的第一位。车床制造业是苏联首要工业之一，大的车床制造工厂是在莫斯科伏尔加流域、乌克兰、乌拉尔、和其他地区。革命前的苏联只有少量的汽车，这些又大都是国外输入的。苏联则建设了强大的汽车工业。在莫斯科，高尔基城，雅罗斯拉夫（莫斯科东北）和乌拉尔等地，都有巨大的汽车工厂在工作着，并兴建着新的汽车工厂。新五年计划结束时，我们的工业将在一年内，生产五十万辆汽车。沙俄时代并不生产拖拉机，现在我们却有了庞大的拖拉机工厂，例如在斯大林格勒、哈尔科夫、车里亚宾斯克、阿尔泰等地，我们国家学会了用自己的力量制造国民经济和军队所需要的任何机器和装备，现在没有一种机器不能在苏联制造，在五年计划结束时，机械和装备将增加到战前水准的二倍。
    斯大林五年计划的年份中，苏联建造了庞大的化学工业来生产肥料、酸类、人造橡皮、颜料、纤维制品和其他产品，并获得了广大的发展。
    木材工业也获得了进展。木材供应过程机械化的程度，一年比一年增加，锯伐树木皆用电力帮助，从伐木的地方到路上砍下的树木，皆用苏联发明的拖拉机运输到河边或火车站。部分的木材作建筑用，部分的给木材业组合制造镶木、火柴杆、火酒和其他化学物品。苏联有一系列的强大的造纸业组合。
    重工业的发展，使我国有可能来显著地扩展利用新的技术装备。轻工业和食品工业供应着广泛需要的物品和滋养品的重要部分。我国轻工业非常广泛，它有棉织、毛织、麻织、缫丝、制袜、皮鞋业和其它。在斯大林五年计划的年份中，所有这些工业部将都建设了许多新的组合和工厂。食品工业差不多完全是在苏维埃政权下才建立的，它建筑在新的现代化的技术基础上。从其装备上说，并不落后于苏联其它工业部门。轻工业和食品工业的巨大进展和农业经济在同一时候的进展，使我国可能逐年增加给人民以广泛必需的物品和滋养品。
    苏联强大的工业早在一九四七年即已达到战前水准。一九四九年六月，它全部工业生产每天平均产量已较战前一九四零年增加百分之四十一，现在全国正展开四年中完成五年计划的巨大的全人民运动。苏联人民在自己的布尔什维克党领导下，在发展工业上将获得日新月异的成功。
  （二）苏联——世界农业经济最前进的国家
    现在我国的农业经济已成为最强大最前进的了，它有近代化技术作基础，能应用所有农业学和最前进米丘林科学的成就，这是在布尔什维克党领导下在我国实现伟大社会主义改造的结果。苏维埃农村中正在加强集体农场的制度，苏联已从个体经营的小农经济国家，改造成为强大的机械化农业经济的国家。苏联在机械化农业经济生产方面占全世界第一位。一九四零年我们土地上有五十三万辆拖拉机，十八万二千辆联合机，二十二万八千辆载重汽车在工作着，并有七千多个拖拉机站。农村中的农业生产应用机器和新的农业技术，不但增加了我们土地的收获量，并保证农业产物的发展。在伟大爱国战争开始前，苏联一年可收获七十万万多普特（每普特合三二·七六市斤）的粮食，而沙俄时代的农业经济只能收获四万万到五万万普特。战后五年计划年份中，社会主义农业经济得到了不下三十二万五千拖拉机和极大数量的各式各样的农业机器，在这些机器中有推进联合机、电力拖拉机、巨型收割机和其它最新式的机器。按照新五年计划的目标，将组织九百五十个新的拖拉机站，我们农业经济生产的主要任务属于谷物经济，苏联是世界上最大的谷物生产者之一。小麦是站在谷类作物中的第一位，它的播种几乎占全部耕种面积的三分之一。苏联在播种麦子的面积上说是世界各国的第一位，我们的麦子以优等的质地著称。苏联种植麦的基地，是与黑土的大草原和森林区域在一起的，它连绵而狭长地从东部伸延到西部区域，其中经过乌克兰、顿河区、库班、中伏尔加河区、南乌拉尔、北哈萨克斯坦、西伯利亚西部等地。苏联领土上广泛地布种着裸麦、燕麦和大麦。谷类作物中占有重要地位的，还有黍、大米和玉蜀黍。
    我国有许多的麦和其他谷类作物，都种植在干燥的区域。在沙俄时代，干旱对于古老技术的个体小农经济是可怕的不能征服的灾难。一九四八年在斯大林同志创导下规划了人类历史上空前的防旱计划，它将建造保护土壤的永久森林、水塘和储水池，以保证这些干燥地区能够年年丰收。按照这个伟大的计划，在一九五零年到一九六五年的十五年中必须组成巨大的国家的森林区，特别是在伏尔加河、乌拉河、顿河和北顿尼兹河的两岸和它们的流域，这些森林区有几个将有数千公里长。此外将近六百万公顷的广大森林区将建在集体农场和国家农场的土地上。感谢英勇的集体农民们的工作，一九四八年全部谷物收获只差少许就达到了战前水准，而谷类作物的平均收获已超过战前。斯大林五年计划中，我国供应工业原料的农业比谷类作物生产的发展还要迅速。供应纤维给棉织工业的棉花是最重要的原料之一。
    苏维埃政权的年份中，棉田和棉花收获量增加的结果，我国棉织工业已经不需要从外国输入原棉。而革命前俄国半数的棉花是向美国购买的。
    棉花需要相当的温度，它生长在南方人工洒水的土地上，主要的产地是中亚细亚和外高加索、乌兹贝克斯坦。
    苏联又努力发展一系列的园艺、葡萄园、果园的区域。
    畜牧业也是农业经济重要的一环。与其他农业经济部门比较起来，牧畜业还相当落后。今天在得到谷物经济生产的重大胜利时，全力在各方面发展畜牧业已成为党和政府发展农业的中心任务。
  （三）苏联的运输业
    苏联拥有广大的领土，所以铁路、水道、公路和航空有着特殊的任务。我们运输业中铁路占着最重要的地位。斯大林同志曾说过：“……苏联要是没有头等的铁路运输，把众多的省份和区域联结成为一个，那么苏联这个国家是不可想象的”。按全部铁路的长度，我们占世界上第二位。我们仍不断地建立着铁路。早在第三个五年计划开始时，苏联的铁路与一九一三年相比，增加了一倍半，铁路运输量则增加了五倍以上。在战后斯大林五年计划中，复兴和向前发展我们的铁路运输，获得了重大的注意。我们将添置强力的火车头和新型的车厢，并将建造七千三百三十公里的新铁路。五年计划完成时，电气化铁路的长度，将增加到五千三百二十五公里。在电气化铁路的长度上，苏联则占世界的第一位。
