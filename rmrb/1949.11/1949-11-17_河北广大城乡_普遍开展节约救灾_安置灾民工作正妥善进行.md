　　Hebei Province's cities and vast non-disaster-stricken rural areas have universally launched saving movements. In Shijiazhuang City, all government organs, factories, and schools are practicing frugality in clothing and food, donating money and goods to aid disaster-stricken compatriots. All cadres of the Municipal Taxation Bureau, in addition to saving one or two taels of rice daily from large and medium-sized canteens, have also launched a wave of cash donations; the Railway Ministry's staff school donated nearly 600,000 yuan; the entire staff of the Coking Plant donated half a day's wages in response to disaster relief. The Tangshan municipal government operated professional companies are mobilizing employees to implement a "labor day" one day per month, continuing until the end of June next year. The "labor day" salary will be entirely donated for disaster relief. A large batch of materials collected in Tangshan has recently been allocated, including 100,000 jin of red grain and more than 600 tons of coal, to aid disaster victims in the Tianjin Special District. In the vast non-disaster-stricken rural areas, a "bowl of rice" disaster relief movement has been launched everywhere. Rural Communist Party members, district and village cadres, are actively responding to the call from higher authorities, saving and donating, and deeply publicizing the significance of disaster relief. Some villages are using the method of guiding farmers to recall past famines to inspire sympathy. In the "bowl of rice" disaster relief movement carried out in more than 20 counties including Xincheng, Dingxing, Laishui, Yixian, Qingyuan, Wuji, and Raoyang, more than 1.9 million jin of grain, and tens of thousands of jin of bran vegetables, dates, and pears have been donated. This movement has now expanded to the Xingtai Special District. According to statistics from early October, 727 natural villages in Xingtai County donated more than 40,000 jin of millet; 76 villages in three districts of Nangong (statistics are not yet complete) have donated more than 37,000 jin of disaster relief grain; 28 villages in Ren County donated 5,800 jin of rice, 7,200 jin of rice bran, and about 9,000 jin of vegetables. Cadres of government organs in Neiqiu, Lincheng, Shahe, Pingxiang, and other counties have also formulated saving plans and are enthusiastically donating. The work of resettling disaster victims in severely affected areas by governments at all levels is also extremely smooth. The vast majority of disaster victims have solved their livelihood problems. For example, in the Fifth District of Mancheng County, Hebei, 293 households and 1,493 people who moved from the flood-stricken areas of Anxin, Gaoyang, and other counties have received enthusiastic help from the local people. Those with labor are either working short-term jobs, doing small business, weaving mats, or ginning cotton; those without labor are participating in spinning thread, and all have been settled. The Shijiazhuang Special District Support Disaster Areas Committee, in order to properly resettle the 5,000 disaster victims prepared to be moved from Jiaoan County, specially instructed all counties to quickly prepare housing, daily necessities, and production tools for the disaster victims, to ensure that after the disaster victims arrive in the village, they have housing, food, and work to do, and no major difficulties occur.

    【本报讯】河北省各城市与广大非灾区农村普遍展开节约运动。石家庄市各机关、工厂、学校都在节衣缩食，捐钱捐物，救济灾胞。市府税务局全体干部每日除大、中灶分别节约一、二两米外，并掀起献金热潮；铁道部职工学校献金近六十万元；炼焦厂全体职工献出半日工资响应救灾。唐山各公营专业公司正发动职工每月实行“劳动日”一日，坚持至明年六月底止。“劳动日”的薪津全部捐出救灾。唐山募集的大批物资，最近已拨出红粮十万斤、煤六百余吨援助天津专区灾民。在广大非灾区农村，到处掀起“一碗米”救灾运动。农村共产党员，区村干部，积极响应上级号召，节约捐献，并深入宣传救灾意义，有的村用引导农民回忆灾荒的办法，启发同情。在新城、定兴、涞水、易县、清苑、无极、饶阳等二十余县所开展的“一碗米”救灾运动，已献出粮食一百九十余万斤，糠菜、枣、梨数万斤。这一运动，现已扩展到邢台专区，据十月上旬统计，邢台全县七百二十七个自然村，捐谷子四万余斤；南宫三个区七十六个村（统计尚不完全），已捐救灾粮三万七千余斤；任县二十八个村，捐米五千八百余斤，谷糠七千二百斤，菜约九千斤。内邱、临城、沙河、平乡等县机关干部中，也订出节约计划，踊跃捐献。各级政府安置重灾地区灾民工作，也极为顺利，绝大多数灾民解决了生活问题，如河北满城县第五区自安新、高阳等县水灾区移来灾民二百九十三户，一千四百九十三人，得到该地群众热情帮助，有劳力的或者去打短工、作小买卖、织席轧花；没有劳动力的参加纺线，都得到了安顿。石家庄专区支援灾区委员会为妥善安置交安县准备移来的五千灾民，特指示各县迅速为灾民准备住房、生活用具、生产用具，保证灾民到村后，有住、有吃、有活可做，不让灾民发生大困难。
