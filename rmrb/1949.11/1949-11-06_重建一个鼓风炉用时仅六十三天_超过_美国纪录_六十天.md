　　Rebuilding a Blast Furnace Takes Only Sixty-Three Days
  　Surpassing the "American Record" by Sixty Days
    The *Pravda* newspaper, in another article describing the work of the Party organization in the factory, stated: The Party organization has played an active role in the movement to increase production. Communist Party members, taking the lead in the socialist competition, have become examples of dedication to labor and the development of creativity, uniting the workers around themselves, encouraging and leading them. Outstanding workers described in several news items how they achieved high levels of production. This year, steelworkers have produced 280 pieces of accelerated castings. The annual, monthly, and daily productivity of the Martin furnace at the Kuznetsk plant is the best in the world. Senior drivers of roughing mills have exceeded the plan by rolling more than 100,000 tons of metal. A *Pravda* reporter, reporting on the work of the Siberian Metallurgical Plant, wrote: Not long ago, an American magazine publicized the "world record" of rebuilding a blast furnace in 123 days in the United States. But a year ago, workers in Kuznetsk, under the difficult conditions of Siberia, quietly rebuilt a larger blast furnace in 74 days. This year, they rebuilt another blast furnace in 63 days. The so-called "world record" of the United States was surpassed by 60 days. The personnel of the Kuznetsk plant are ahead of time and have made valuable contributions to Stalin's post-war Five-Year Plan.

　　重建一个鼓风炉用时仅六十三天
  　超过“美国纪录”六十天
    真理报又在另一篇文章里描写该工厂中党组织的工作情形称：党的组织在提高生产的运动中起了积极的作用。在社会主义竞赛中带头的共产党员，成为献身劳动与发挥创造性的范例，团结工人在自己周围，鼓舞并领导他们。卓越的工人们在若干消息中描叙他们怎样获得高度的生产水平。今年炼钢工人已生产了二百八十件加速熔铸物。库兹涅茨克工厂马丁炉的每年每月每日的生产率，都是世界上首屈一指的。粗辗机高级司机超计划辗了十万多吨金属。真理报记者在报道西伯利亚冶金工厂的工作时写道：不久以前，一本美国杂志曾大事宣扬美国在一百二十三日中重建鼓风炉的“世界纪录”。但一年以前，库兹涅茨克的工人，在西伯利亚的艰苦情形之下，却不声不响地在七十四天里重建了一个更大的鼓风炉，今年又在六十三天内重建了另一个鼓风炉。所谓美国的“世界纪录”竟被超过了六十日。库兹涅茨克工厂的人员跑在时间的前头，对斯大林战后五年计划作了很有价值的贡献。
