Joint Circular from the Hebei Provincial Government and Military Region
  　Protect Transportation and Strictly Prevent Sabotage
    [This Newspaper's Report] With the active efforts of railway workers and the assistance of all the people, the railways within Hebei Province have been successively repaired and opened to traffic, including the Tianjin-Pukou, Beining, Beijing-Suiyuan, Zhengtai, and Shide lines, in addition to the Beijing-Hankou Railway's Shijiazhuang-Anyang section which will soon be open to traffic. This will play a significant role in supporting the Liberation War, promoting economic prosperity, exchanging goods, and connecting urban and rural areas. However, recently, railways and power lines have been continuously subjected to sabotage. Some of this sabotage is being carried out in an organized and planned manner by bad elements, while some is the result of individual backward masses who, for their own petty gains or being used by bandits and spies, steal electric wires and dismantle rail spikes and fishplates. This not only causes losses to state property but also seriously affects railway transportation work. To this end, our governments at all levels, armed forces, and public security departments should heighten their vigilance and conscientiously take responsibility for protecting railways and power lines.
    1. All armed forces, public security departments, and cadres at all levels should pay attention to strengthening ties with railway bureaus and sections, and cooperate with each other to complete railway protection tasks.
    2. All villagers, militias, and village cadres along the railways should be vigilant at all times and report any destructive activities by bad elements to the local government or railway section.
    3. Those who sabotage railways and power lines will be given education or punished according to the severity of their sabotage, while bandits and spies who attempt to sabotage national construction will be severely punished according to the law.

　　河北省府军区联合通告
  　保护交通严防破坏
    【本报讯】河北省人民政府，河北军区为保护境内各铁路，防止匪特破坏，特发出联合通告，原文如下：
    我省境内铁路，在铁路员工的积极抢修和全体人民的帮助下，除京汉路石安段不久即能通车外，津浦、北宁、京绥、正太、石德各线均已先后修复通车，这对支援解放战争，繁荣经济，交流物资，沟通城乡关系，将起着重大作用。但近来不断发现各线铁路及电线遭受破坏，有的系坏分子有组织有计划进行破坏，有的则系个别落后群众为自己贪图小利或为匪特利用而偷割电线拆道钉夹板等。这不但造成国家资财的损失，且严重的影响了铁路运输工作。为此我各级人民政府，武装部队，公安部门应提高警惕，认真负责护路护线工作：
    一、各武装部队，公安部门及各级干部，要注意与铁路局及各段站加强联系互相配合完成护路任务。
    二、各铁路沿线之村庄，所有群众民兵村干部应随时检举和监视坏分子的破坏活动，并向当地政府或铁路段站报告。
    三、对破坏铁路及电线者按其破坏情节轻重分别给以教育或处分，对企图破坏国家建设之匪特分子则依法严惩。
