　　One of the Culprits in the Assassination of General Li Zhaolin,
  　Nan Shoushan, Arrested in Beijing
    [Beijing News] Nan Shoushan, one of the culprits in the assassination of General Li Zhaolin, has been arrested by the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau. After preliminary interrogation, the suspect confessed that in March 1946, he was introduced by Gao Xi, a dermatologist at the Harbin Red Cross Hospital, to He Shiying, a Kuomintang Military Bureau agent, and engaged in counter-revolutionary activities. He conspired with He to carry out the heinous act of assassinating General Li Zhaolin. The suspect also provided 100 grams of potassium cyanide poison for the assassination. Later, because the Harbin authorities were hunting down the assassins of General Li Zhaolin, the suspect fled to Beijing to evade punishment, working as a doctor at the Municipal Third Hospital as a cover. After investigation by the Municipal Public Security Bureau, he was arrested and brought to justice on November 1.
