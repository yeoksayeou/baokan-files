    Don't call me a model,
    And don't call me a hero!
    Just call me "soldier!"
    "A soldier of the people!"

    You ask what my name is?
    It's not so nice to say:
    My milk name was "Old Soft,"
    I was only called "Zhang Yong" after I joined the army.

    You ask about my family history,
    Ah! It's better not to ask,
    Whenever I think about it,
    My heart is filled with anger!

    When I was a child, my family was desperately poor,
    I herded cattle and cut grass for the landlord,
    Because I damaged a sickle,
    The landlord fired me!

    When the Anti-Japanese War began,
    There was rent and interest reduction in the village,
    My family finally had land to cultivate,
    And no longer went hungry.

    That year I was only seventeen,
    Not tall, but strong,
    I was determined to become a Eighth Route Army soldier,
    Fighting guerrillas behind enemy lines!

    Since enlisting in the army,
    I've begun to grow smarter,
    I understood many principles in class,
    And performed meritorious service several times in battle.

    After one meritorious service, I joined the Party,
    During one charge, I was wounded,
    In one battle, I captured guns and cannons,
    I remember all of these things.

    The Party teaches me to "Serve the people wholeheartedly!"
    "We are always a fighting force!"
    I write these words in my diary,
    I read them and recite them several times a week!

    I hold the gun seized from the enemy,
    Serving as the vanguard of national defense,
    Suppressing the troublemaking of bad guys,
    Preparing to break the legs of the invaders!

    Our comrades are in the thousands and millions,
    Our comrades are all brave,
    Following Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu De,
    I am just "one" brave fighter!

    Fighter and Communist Party member,
    I really like these titles,
    But please don't call me a hero,
    And don't call me a model!

    别叫我模范，
    也别称我英雄！
    干脆叫我“兵！”
    “人民的子弟兵！”
　
    你问我叫什么？
    说出来可不好听：
    奶名叫“老软”
    入伍以后才叫“张勇。”
　
    问我的家庭历史，
    唉！不问也好，
    我一想起来，
    心里就气恼！
　
    我小时候家贫难熬，
    给地主放牛割草，
    因为损坏了一张镰刀，
    地主把我开除掉！
　
    抗日战争一开始，
    村里闹减租减息，
    我家才有了地种，
    再也不饿肚皮。
　
    那年我才十七，
    身个不高可有力气，
    下决心当了八路，
    在敌后打着游击！
　
    自从入伍当了兵，
    我才开始变聪明，
    上课懂了好多道理，
    打仗立了好几次功。
　
    那一次立功后我入了党，
    那一次冲锋时我负了伤，
    那一次打仗我缴获了枪炮，
    这些，我都一一记在心上。
　
    党教我“好好为人民服务！”
    “我们永远是战斗队！”
    这些话，我都记在日记本上，
    我每周看几回，念几回！
　
    我拿着向敌人夺来的枪，
    担任着国防的前卫，
    镇压坏蛋们的捣乱，
    准备打断侵略者的狗腿！
　
    我们的战友成千成万，
    我们的战友个个勇敢，
    跟着毛主席和朱德总司令，
    我只是“一个”勇敢的战斗员！
　
    战斗员和共产党员，
    这些称号我就挺喜欢，
    可千万别称我英雄，
    也别叫我模范！
