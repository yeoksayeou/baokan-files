Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, November 25th. Shandong Province is actively carrying out livestock epidemic prevention work. Due to the destruction and damage caused by the Kuomintang bandit troops and the impact of water and drought disasters over the years, anthrax and cattle plague have become prevalent among livestock in some areas of the province. According to statistics from the first half of the year, the number of livestock deaths reached 20,000 head, causing anxiety among farmers with livestock. In order to quickly carry out prevention and treatment, the Shandong Provincial People's Government's Department of Industry and Commerce recruited veterinary personnel in April this year, collected and purchased veterinary equipment scattered throughout the province, and established a provincial veterinary serum manufacturing plant and veterinary hospital. The veterinary serum manufacturing plant has manufactured three types of preventative vaccines that can supply the entire province: cattle plague preventative fluid, rabbit-adapted cattle plague vaccine, and anthrax spore vaccine. Two therapeutic agents, cattle plague serum and anthrax bovine serum, will also be available soon. In the past six months, the veterinary hospital has treated 624 head of livestock for farmers, and has successively dispatched 13 prevention and treatment teams to epidemic areas to carry out anthrax preventative inoculations, having inoculated more than 61,000 head of livestock. Anthrax is now basically under control. The veterinary serum manufacturing plant is continuing to construct its site, preparing to expand production. The provincial government is also recruiting and training veterinary personnel on a large scale. The Bohai, Luzhongnan, and Jiaodong regions of the province have also established veterinary hospitals and plan to establish 13 veterinary epidemic prevention stations, so that all livestock in the province can be universally inoculated.

　　山东积极防畜疫
  　全省牲畜将普遍注射
    【新华社济南二十五日电】山东省积极进行牲畜的防疫工作。该省各地由于历年遭受国民党匪军的摧残破坏和水旱等灾荒影响，若干地方牲口普遍流行炭疽病和年瘟症，据上半年统计，死亡牲口达二万头，引起有牲畜的农民不安。山东省人民政府实业厅为迅速进行防治，特于今年四月招聘兽医人员，搜集和购买分散各地之兽医器械，建立省立兽疫血清制造厂和兽医院。兽医血清制造厂已制造了能供给全省使用的牛瘟预防液、兔化毒牛瘟疫苗、炭疽芽胞苗等三种预防疫苗，和不久即可应用的牛瘟血清、炭疽牛血清两种治疗药剂。半年来，兽医院为农民治疗牲口六百二十四头，并先后派出十三个防治小组，至病疫流行地区进行炭疽病预防注射，已经注射了六万一千余头牲口，炭疽病现已基本上停止流行。兽疫血清制造厂现正继续建设厂址，准备扩大生产。省政府亦正大量招收并训练兽医人员。该省渤海、鲁中南、胶东等三个区也设立了兽医院，并计划建立十三个兽疫防治站，作到全省牲口普遍进行预防注射。
