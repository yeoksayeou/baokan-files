　　Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 7th. The production and construction work of the state-owned chemical industry in Northeast China is progressing very rapidly. Two-thirds of the factories under the Chemical Industry Bureau of the Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government have started operations. The products have increased from more than ten to forty types, and the machinery and equipment have also been enriched compared to before. Taking a chemical factory in a certain area as an example, the factory could originally only produce four types of products: caustic soda, bleaching powder, soap, and hydrochloric acid. Now it can produce as many as nineteen types. The newly added products include cylinder oil, hardened oil, aluminum chloride, glycerin, hardened grease, soft grease, potassium chlorate, transformer oil substitute, stearic acid, oxygen, and liquid chlorine. These are all important chemical products necessary for industrial construction in Northeast China. The oil, alcohol, sulfuric acid, electrochemistry, and marine chemistry factories that have resumed work in various places have also made considerable progress. The recent oxygen production of a chemical factory in a certain area has created a record of manufacturing 120 cubic meters per hour, which is ten times the level during the puppet Manchukuo period. As a result of continuous improvement of production methods in various factories, product quality has gradually improved, and raw materials and costs have gradually decreased. According to the Chemical Industry Bureau, many of the factories that were not started or were shut down after a short period of operation during the Kuomintang rule suffered severe mechanical damage, requiring a long time to repair after being taken over. Through the efforts of the People's Government and the workers, they have finally been quickly and gradually restored. Recently, in order to overcome the shortage of technical workers, the Chemical Industry Bureau has transferred many workers from various factories and recruited a group of educated youths to set up training classes to train junior cadres and senior technicians for the chemical industry, laying the foundation for the future development of the chemical industry.

　　东北化学工业逐步发展
  　工厂大部开工产品增至四十种
    【新华社沈阳七日电】东北地区国营化学工业的生产和修建工作，进展十分迅速。东北人民政府工业部化学工业管理局所属工厂已有三分之二开工，产品由十余种增至四十种，机器设备亦较以前充实。以某地化学工厂为例，该厂原来只能生产火碱、漂白粉、肥皂、盐酸四种，现在已可生产十九种之多。新增加的产品中有汽缸油、硬化油、氯化铝、甘油、硬黄油、软黄油、氯酸钾、代变压器油、硬脂酸、氧气、液体氯气等，这些都是东北工业建设中所必需的重要化学制品。各地已复工的油脂、酒精、硫酸、电气化学及海水化学等工厂，亦有较大发展。某地化学工厂最近氧气的生产，已创造了每小时制造一百二十立方公尺的纪录，为伪满时水平的十倍。各厂由于不断改进生产方法的结果，产品质量逐渐提高，原料和成本逐渐减低。按化学工业管理局所属各工厂，在国民党统治时期未开工或短期开工后又停工的很多，机械损毁严重，以致接收后需要较长的时间进行修建。经人民政府和职工们的努力，终于迅速逐渐恢复。最近化学工业管理局为了克服技术工人缺乏的困难，已从各厂抽调了许多工人，并招收了一部分知识青年，设立训练班，以培养化学工业的初级干部及较高级的技术工人，为将来化学工业的发展打下基础。
