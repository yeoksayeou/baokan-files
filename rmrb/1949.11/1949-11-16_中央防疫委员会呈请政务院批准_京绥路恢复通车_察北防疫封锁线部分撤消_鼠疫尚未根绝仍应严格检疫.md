　　Central Anti-Epidemic Committee Requests the State Council to Approve
  　Restoration of Traffic on the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway
    Partial Lifting of the Anti-Epidemic Blockade Line in Northern Chahar
  　Plague Not Yet Eradicated, Strict Quarantine Still Necessary
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 15th: The plague in northern Chahar has stopped spreading. The Central Anti-Epidemic Committee has requested the State Council to approve the reopening of railway traffic on the Datong and Nankou sections of the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway, effective from the 16th. Dong Biwu, Chairman of the Central Anti-Epidemic Committee, today sent a letter to the Ministry of Railways, requesting immediate execution by its subordinates. The letter also stated: After the restoration of traffic on the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway, anti-epidemic work should be further strengthened. The Anti-Epidemic Committee of the Ministry of Railways should dispatch quarantine personnel on each train, traveling back and forth with the train, to strictly implement quarantine work. Merchants traveling to Beijing from Zhangjiakou and Kongjiazhuang in Xuanhua must purchase tickets with a vaccination certificate. All goods transported from Zhangjiakou to Guihua and Beijing, especially hides and furs, must be inspected; dilapidated items that are difficult to disinfect are not allowed to be transported. Goods transported from other places to Zhangjiakou are not subject to this restriction. Train staff and platform porters must be vaccinated against the plague.
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 15th: Dong Biwu, Chairman of the Central Anti-Epidemic Committee, recently spoke to reporters regarding the cessation of the plague's spread in northern Chahar, the partial lifting of the blockade line, and the restoration of traffic on the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway, stating: "In less than twenty days, we have stopped the spread of the plague. This is a great achievement. This is the result of the wise leadership of the Central People's Government and the active prevention and control work of all anti-epidemic personnel, Party and government officials at all levels, military personnel, and civilians, as well as the strong assistance of our great ally, the Soviet Union." After careful study of the epidemic situation and upon the approval of the State Council of the Central People's Government, the Central Anti-Epidemic Committee has decided to lift part of the blockade line in southern Chahar and restore traffic on the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway, effective from the 16th of this month. From then on, material exchanges between Chahar-Suiyuan and other regions have been unblocked, which will further contribute to the economic recovery and construction of various regions. Chairman Dong Biwu specifically pointed out during the conversation: "The plague has stopped spreading, but this does not mean that it has been completely eradicated. Therefore, we must not relax our anti-epidemic work in the slightest in the future." Anti-epidemic committees at all levels should strengthen quarantine, vaccinations, rat catching, flea extermination, sanitation, and other work, and continue to carry out various publicity and mobilization efforts to combat any possible complacency.
Beijing News: The plague in northern Chahar has stopped spreading, and the blockade line in southern Chahar was partially lifted today. To continue to thoroughly eliminate the plague, the Central Anti-Epidemic Committee has decided that the focus of future work will be to strengthen quarantine work, reduce the scope of the blockade in the epidemic area, continue vaccination, rat catching, flea extermination, sanitation, and other work. Since the plague was discovered in Qiantuyin Village, Chahar League, northern Chahar, it spread to Chahan Bengbeng Village, Kangbao, and even near the Ji family housing village southeast of Zhangjiakou. A total of ten villages were affected, with 69 plague patients and 66 deaths. The Central People's Government took emergency measures on October 26, establishing the Central Anti-Epidemic Committee and instructing provinces and cities in North China to establish anti-epidemic committees to uniformly dispatch troops and health personnel to carry out blockade, prevention and control, publicity and mobilization, and other work. Under the direct leadership of the Central People's Government, thanks to the strong support of the friendly Soviet Union and the timely and active prevention and control efforts of anti-epidemic personnel, Party and government officials at all levels, military personnel, and civilians, no new plague patients have been discovered in the epidemic areas since November 5. During this anti-epidemic period of less than twenty days, the Central Anti-Epidemic Committee dispatched a total of 1,259 anti-epidemic and quarantine personnel, and issued 3,489,360 cc of dead bacteria vaccine and 765,575 doses of live bacteria vaccine for universal injection. In addition, 700,800 cc of dead bacteria vaccine will continue to be issued to provincial and municipal anti-epidemic committees for injection. In addition, with the efforts of various publicity organizations, the committee has carried out mass anti-epidemic publicity and mobilization work in various forms.
Our Correspondent in Zhangjiakou, 14th: Dr. Rakson, a Soviet medical expert, and Captain Maisky, leader of the Soviet anti-epidemic team, who went to Kangbao in northern Chahar and the epidemic area of Chahar League on the 6th of this month to investigate the epidemic situation and assist in epidemic prevention, successfully completed their work and returned to Zhangjiakou at 2 pm yesterday. Li Zhizhong, Director of the Anti-Epidemic Department of the Central Anti-Epidemic Committee, also returned to Zhangjiakou at the same time. Soviet animal expert Tereschenko and anti-epidemic expert Stepanova, who went to northern Chahar with Dr. Rakson to investigate the epidemic situation, are still conducting rodent bacteria research in Longwangmiao, Chahar League. At that time, Dr. Rakson and others held a meeting with the Chinese and Soviet anti-epidemic teams working in Zhangjiakou, Zhang Su, Chairman of the Chahar Provincial Anti-Epidemic Committee, Commander Wang Ping and other responsible persons to report on the epidemic situation in northern Chahar and Chahar League and discuss future anti-epidemic work.

　　中央防疫委员会呈请政务院批准
  　京绥路恢复通车
    察北防疫封锁线部分撤消
  　鼠疫尚未根绝仍应严格检疫
    【新华社北京十五日电】察北鼠疫已停止蔓延，中央防疫委员会已呈请政务院批准，自十六日起开放京绥路大同、南口段铁路交通。中央防疫委员会董必武主任委员今日特致函铁道部，请即饬令所属执行。该函并称：京绥铁路交通恢复后，防疫工作应更加强。铁道部防疫委员会在每列车都应派检疫人员，随车往返，严格执行检疫工作。张家口与宣化孔家庄之间，来京之客商，必需凭防疫注射证购票。凡张家口运往归绥与北京之货物，特别是兽皮兽毛，需经检查；不易消毒之破烂物品，均不准运送。由他处运往张家口之货物，则不在此限。列车工作人员，与站台搬运人员，均必须注射鼠疫苗。
    【新华社北京十五日电】中央防疫委员会董必武主任委员，顷就察北鼠疫停止蔓延、封锁线部分撤消、京绥铁路恢复通车事，对记者发表谈话称：在不到二十天的时间内，我们把鼠疫的蔓延停止了。这个成绩是很大的。这是由于中央人民政府的英明领导暨全体防疫工作人员、各级党政军民积极进行防治工作的结果，也是伟大友邦苏联的大力援助的结果。中央防疫委员会在经过对疫情的缜密研究，并呈请中央人民政府政务院的批准之后，已决定自本月十六日起，撤除察南的部分封锁线，恢复京绥铁路通车。此后，察绥和各地间，物资交流已告畅通，将更有助于各地经济的恢复和建设。董必武主任委员在谈话时，特别指出：鼠疫是停止蔓延了，但并不等于已经彻底根绝，因此，今后仍不能丝毫松懈防疫工作。各级防疫委员会更应加强检疫、预防注射、捕鼠、灭蚤、清洁卫生等工作，并要继续进行各种宣传动员工作，反对可能产生的麻痹偏向。
    【北京讯】察北鼠疫已停止蔓延，察南封锁线于今日部分解除。为继续彻底扑灭鼠疫，中央防疫委员会决定今后工作重点为加强检疫工作，缩小疫区的封锁，继续预防注射和捕鼠灭蚤、清洁卫生等工作。鼠疫自从在察北察哈尔盟前土音村发现后，曾蔓延至察汉崩崩村、康保直至张家口东南的姬家房村附近。前后共波及十个村子，计鼠疫患者六十九人，死六十六人。中央人民政府为此曾于十月二十六日采取紧急措置，成立中央防疫委员会，并责成华北各省市成立防疫委员会，统一调度军队及卫生人员等进行封锁、防治、宣传动员等工作。在中央人民政府的直接领导下，由于友邦苏联的大力支援及防疫人员和各级党政军民的及时、积极的防治，自十一月五日起，疫区各村即未继续发现鼠疫患者。在这不满二十天的防疫期间、中央防疫委员会共出动防疫和检疫人员一千二百五十九人，发出死菌疫苗三百四十八万九千三百六十公撮、生菌疫苗七十六万五千五百七十五人份作为普遍注射之用，另有七十万零八百公撮死菌疫苗，即将继续发给各省市防疫委员会进行注射。此外，该会在各宣传机构的努力配合下，曾以各种形式，进行了群众性的防疫宣传动员工作。
    【本报记者张家口十四日专电】本月六日前往察北康保及察盟疫区考察疫情、帮助防疫的苏联医学专家拉克森博士、苏联防疫队麦斯基队长等一行胜利完成工作任务，于昨日下午二时返抵张家口，中央防疫委员会防疫处长李志中亦同时返张。与拉克森博士同往察北考察疫情的苏联动物专家捷列士钦克、防疫专家斯杰潘诺娃等七人，现仍留察盟龙王庙进行鼠类保菌研究。当时拉克森博士等曾与留张工作之中、苏防疫队，察省防疫委员会张苏主席，王平司令员等负责人开会，汇报察北、察盟疫情与讨论今后的防疫工作，今日下午一时继续开会，研究今后防疫工作。由于察盟察北、及张市乡区姬家房子村鼠疫已停止蔓延，会议决定：张家口本市十六日恢复正常情况，学生上课，影戏院开演，露天市场开市。今晚八时张苏主席为拉克森博士、麦斯基队长、李志中处长等设宴洗尘。    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（光明）
