    Promote the Locomotive Responsibility System
    National Locomotive Banner - "Mao Zedong" Locomotive Ordered to Demonstrate in Zhengzhou Locomotive Depot
    And Learn from Worker Brothers in Zhengzhou Locomotive Depot
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 16th] In order to promote the experience of the locomotive responsibility system, the national locomotive banner - the "Mao Zedong" locomotive, left Fengtai Locomotive Depot on the 9th of this month, ordered to demonstrate in Zhengzhou Locomotive Depot. This locomotive was transferred to the Fengtai Locomotive Depot of the Tianjin Railway Bureau in March of this year to assist the Fengtai Locomotive Depot in promoting the responsibility system. Now the Fengtai Depot has achieved significant results in promoting the responsibility system. On the 9th of this month, the locomotive was ordered to be transferred to the Zhengzhou Locomotive Depot. The "Mao Zedong" locomotive is the first locomotive in the country to implement the responsibility system, and is driven and maintained by nine crew members, including the famous railway hero Li Yong (chief driver) and Guo Shude. This locomotive was originally a damaged locomotive in Harbin, which was repaired by workers after liberation and then driven by Li Yong and others. They deeply felt that the large shift system implemented in the crew before liberation could not make the crew care for and cherish the locomotive, and agreed to implement the responsibility system. Since then, the "Mao Zedong" locomotive has been contracted by Li Yong and others for driving and repair. Due to their careful operation and serious maintenance, the quality of the "Mao Zedong" locomotive has been continuously improved, and a series of glorious records have been created in driving. The locomotive has safely traveled more than 139,000 kilometers without accidents; when the monthly driving standard kilometer for each locomotive was set at 5,000 kilometers, the locomotive exceeded 6,000 kilometers; when the new driving system was implemented, the locomotive pioneered a technical speed of 41.8 kilometers; in addition, the locomotive also shortened the depot stop time and saved coal and oil, etc. Due to these achievements, the locomotive was selected as the national locomotive banner at this year's National Locomotive Affairs Conference. The model locomotives of the Fengtai Locomotive Depot, such as the May 1st Labor and No. 1939, were produced with the help and cultivation of the "Mao Zedong" locomotive. This time, the locomotive was ordered to work in the Zhengzhou Locomotive Depot. Before departure, they formulated a work plan for the south, guaranteeing to achieve good, stable, fast, and economical results, and humbly learn from the worker brothers in the Zhengzhou Locomotive Depot to further improve their work.

    全国机车旗帜—毛泽东号机车奉命往郑州机务段示范
    并向郑州机务段工人弟兄学习
    【新华社北京十六日电】为推广机车包乘制的经验，全国机车的旗帜——毛泽东号机车已于本月九日离开丰台机务段，奉命前往郑州机务段示范。该机车系于今年三月奉调入关，在天津铁路局丰台机务段服务，协助丰台机务段推行包乘制。现丰台段在推行包乘制方面已得了显著成绩。本月九日，该机车又奉命调往郑州机务段。毛泽东号机车是全国第一个实行包乘制的机车，由著名的铁道英雄李永（司机长）、郭树德等九名乘务员负责驾驶、检修。该机车原是哈尔滨的一辆破损机车，解放后经工人修好后即由李永等驾驶。他们深感解放前乘务上所实行的大轮班制，不能使乘务员对机车关心爱护，赞成实行包乘制，此后毛泽东号机车即由李永等包开包修。由于他们精心操纵，认真检修，毛泽东号机车的质量日益提高，行车上先后创造了一连串的光荣纪录。该机车曾安全行驶十三万九千余公里没有发生事故；在每机车每月行车标准公里定为五千公里时，该机车即超过六千公里；实行新行车制时，该机车首创四十一点八公里的技术速度；此外该机车还缩短了库停时间，节省了煤、油等等。由于这些成绩，该机车于今年全国机务会议上被选为全国机车的旗帜。丰台机务段的模范机车，如五一劳动号和一九三九号，就是在毛泽东号机车的帮助、培养下产生的。此次该机车奉调到郑州机务段工作，出发前他们曾订出南下工作计划，保证要做到好、稳、快、省，并虚心向郑州机务段工人弟兄学习，以进一步提高工作。
