    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] The Joint Conference on Water Conservancy in various liberated areas was held from the 9th to the 12th, during which representatives from various regions reported on the state of water conservancy work. In their reports, representatives from Shaanxi, Ningxia, Suiyuan, Shanxi, and other provinces, where there were no floods or very few floods, advocated large-scale canal irrigation due to the constant threat of severe drought. Representatives from other regions emphasized that the guiding principle of China's water conservancy construction in the coming period should still be to strengthen river defenses and eliminate floods. When discussing the severe floods in various places this year, the representatives all agreed that the main reason was the result of the reactionary rule of previous dynasties. In particular, during the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation, the enemy and puppets conspired to use water as a weapon, deliberately sabotaging or being affected by enemy division, blockade, and war, making comprehensive repairs impossible, and thus the embankments were dilapidated and weak. Furthermore, this year's floods were too large, the flood season started earlier than in previous years, and typhoons struck, resulting in serious disasters. According to incomplete statistics, this year, floods in Central China, East China, Northeast China, North China, and Northwest China inundated more than 120 million mu of farmland, of which more than 50 million mu have been rescued in various ways, and it is estimated that grain production will be reduced by about 14.3 billion jin. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the masses in various places repaired river defenses and fought tenaciously against the floods. According to rough statistics, the People's Government used more than 650 million jin of grain for river management and flood prevention this year. Due to the high importance attached to flood prevention by the Party, government, and army in various places, the emancipated peasants were in high spirits for production, and hundreds of thousands of peasants, soldiers, and cadres were mobilized to join the battle to protect production by fighting the water. Leaders took responsibility, cadres took the lead, and countless heroic and exemplary deeds occurred. When the water situation was urgent in Wuhan, the Military Control Commission immediately allocated three regiments of troops to assist in the rescue, and the Hankou Federation of Trade Unions also organized two thousand unemployed workers to participate. When the Yellow River was in danger, the Shandong Provincial Government immediately sent two department heads to the embankment in person, leading 200,000 soldiers and civilians, persisting for 25 days, and saving the critical situation. When a breach was discovered in Yangzhou, more than 300 people connected shoulder to shoulder and used their bodies as a temporary dam, resisting the flood for an hour. Only after the equipment arrived, the situation was turned around. In Shanzhou, the Yellow River had a flow rate of more than 10,000 cubic meters per second, lasting for 99 hours, and no breach occurred due to active rescue efforts. In particular, the Guantai dangerous project, where the quicksand bottom was as deep as ten zhang, and the dam *sào* was constantly and rapidly collapsing, was finally turned from danger to safety after 25 days and nights of rescue. Water conservancy expert Zhang Hanying, based on statistics from historical records, explained that when the flow rate of the Yellow River in Shanzhou reaches 10,000 cubic meters per second, the chance of a breach is three-quarters. This is enough to prove the great achievements of flood prevention work under the leadership of the People's Government. The representatives unanimously agreed that a government that wholeheartedly serves the people is the main guarantee for obtaining the above-mentioned achievements.

    在人民政府和中共领导下
    全国各地战胜水患
    水利联席会上各代表报告情况
    【本报讯】各解放区水利联席会议，自九日起至十二日，各区代表报告水利工作情况。在报告中，陕西、宁夏、绥远、山西等没有水患或水患极少的省份因常受严重的旱灾威胁，主张大量开渠灌溉。其他各区代表均着重说明：中国水利建设事业的方针在今后一定时期内，仍以加强河防，消灭洪患为主。代表们在说到今年各地严重的水灾时，均认为主要原因首先是历代反动统治的结果。特别是抗日战争及解放战争时期，敌伪阴谋以水代兵，蓄意破坏，或受敌分割、封锁及战争影响，不可能全面修整，因而堤防残破不堪，抵抗力薄弱。再就是今年洪水过大，汛期又较往年提前，加以台风袭击，以致造成严重灾害。据不甚精确统计，今年华中、华东、东北、华北、西北各地水淹田地达一亿二千余万亩，已用各种方式脱出了五千余万亩，估计约减收粮食一百四十三亿斤。各地群众在共产党及人民政府领导下，修整河防，并与洪水作了顽强斗争。粗略统计，人民政府今年用于治河防汛的粮食有六亿五千余万斤。由于各地党、政、军对防汛的高度重视，翻身农民生产情绪高涨，动辄数十万农民、军队及干部投入与水搏斗的保卫生产的战线。首长负责，干部带头，英勇模范事例，不胜列举。武汉军管会在水情紧急时，立拨三团兵力协助抢险，汉口总工会也组织了两千失业工人参加。当黄河告急时，山东省府马上派两个厅长亲自上堤，率领廿万军民，坚持廿五日，挽救了危局。扬州发现一决口，三百多群众肩背相连，以身做子埝。抵御洪水达一小时之久，器材赶到后，始转危为安。黄河在陕州流量达一万秒立方公尺以上的洪水，持续九十九小时，经积极抢护未出一决口。特别是贯台险工，流沙底深达十丈，坝ｓàｏ＠①不断急剧下蛰，经二十五昼夜抢救，终于化险为夷。水利专家张含英根据历年记载统计，说明黄河在陕州的流量达一万秒立方公尺时，决口机会即达四分之三。这足可证明在人民政府领导下的防汛工作的伟大成绩。与会代表一致认为：一个全心全意为人民服务的政府，乃是获得上述成绩的主要保证。
