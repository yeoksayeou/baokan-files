Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 23rd -- TASS, Moscow: Pravda published the second part of Mayevsky's article commenting on the world situation, titled "The Chinese People are Building a New Life."

Mayevsky wrote: The decisive victory of the people's revolution has ushered Chinese history into a new era. The Chinese people are firmly and practically laying the foundation for a new life.

The People's Republic of China has become an indispensable member of the democratic family of nations. The Central People's Government under the leadership of Mao Zedong has established friendly relations with the Soviet Union and many people's democratic countries.

While victoriously completing the liberation of the entire country from the rule of Kuomintang bandits, the Chinese people are concentrating their efforts on the economic construction of the republic. The main task is to restore the national economy destroyed by the Chiang Kai-shek clique and foreign imperialists, and to continue its development in order to complete China's industrialization.

The Central People's Government is drafting plans for the restoration and development of major industries. Attention will be mainly focused on heavy industry to lay the foundation for national industrialization. The government is making every effort to rapidly restore state-owned enterprises and encourage the development of cooperative enterprises, while it does not exclude cooperation between state and private capital.

The working class plays a decisive role in China's industrialization. Millions of Chinese working people are victoriously restoring the destroyed factories, manufacturing plants, mines, and railways. New labor methods—competition and mass movements to create production records—are growing in scale. In agriculture, the People's Government is working to consolidate the achievements made in areas where land reform has been fully implemented, mobilize the peasant masses to increase agricultural production, and assist farmers in organizing mutual aid. In areas where land reform has not yet been implemented, the government strives to reduce the burden on working peasants.

The author pointed out: The cultural revolution is an integral part of the Chinese people's revolution. The government is taking steps to establish a large-scale network of educational and cultural organizations. The enlightenment and education system is being reformed on a democratic basis. As in other aspects, in the cultural aspect of the Chinese people, great attention is also paid to the great achievements of the Soviet people. The recent visit of the Soviet cultural workers delegation to China is of paramount importance in strengthening the cultural ties between the Soviet Union and China. The warm reception received by representatives of socialist countries, as well as the establishment and rapid development of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, brilliantly demonstrate the unbreakable friendship between the Soviet people and the Chinese people in the struggle against warmongers and for peace and democracy.

The author finally emphasized, pointing out the provocative actions taken by warmongers against the People's Republic of China: The imperialists' provocative behavior is vicious, but also fragile. They cannot frighten anyone. The Chinese people have embarked on the bright road to a new life, and they will not allow anyone to stop them from moving forward.

　　马耶夫斯基
    【新华社北京二十三日电】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报刊载马耶夫斯基评论世界形势论文的第二部分，题为“中国人民正在建设新生活”。
    马耶夫斯基写道：人民革命的决定性胜利，使中国历史步入了一个新时代。中国人民正在坚定而切实地奠定新生活的基础。
    中华人民共和国已成为民主国家大家庭中不可缺少的一员。毛泽东领导下的中央人民政府，已与苏联及许多人民民主国家建立了友好关系。
    中国人民一方面正在胜利地完成把全国从国民党匪徒统治下解放出来，一方面又集中力量于共和国的经济建设。主要的任务在于恢复被蒋介石集团统治和外国帝国主义者所毁坏了的国民经济，并使其继续发展，以完成中国的工业化。
    中央人民政府正着手草拟关于恢复和发展主要工业的计划。注意力将主要地集中在重工业方面，以奠定国家工业化的基础。政府正尽力迅速地恢复国营企业，并鼓励合作社事业的发展，同时，它并不排斥国家与私人资本之间的合作。
    工人阶级对中国的工业化起着决定性的作用。千百万中国劳动人民正在胜利地恢复被破坏了的工厂、制造厂、矿山和铁路。新的劳动方式——竞赛和创造生产纪录的群众运动——其规模越来越大。在农业方面，人民政府正在进行工作，以巩固已充分实施土地改革的地区所获致的成果，动员农民大众提高农业生产，并协助农民组织互助。在土地改革尚未实施的地区，政府尽力减轻劳动农民的负担。
    作者指出：文化革命是中国人民革命的一个组成部分。政府正在采取步骤，建立大规模的教育和文化组织网。启蒙与教育制度正在民主基础上加以改造。与其他方面相同，在中国人民文化方面，亦时刻注视着苏联人民的伟大成就。苏联文化工作者代表团最近访问中国，在加强苏联与中国的文化联系上，具有至为重要的意义。社会主义国家代表们所受到的热烈招待，以及中苏友好协会的建立和迅速的发展，光辉地证明了苏联人民与中国人民之间在反对战争贩子、争取和平与民主的斗争中的不可破坏的友谊。
    作者最后指出战争贩子们在反对中华人民共和国方面所表现的挑拨行动时强调称：帝国主义者的这种挑拨行为，是恶毒的但同时也是脆弱的。他们吓不倒任何人。中国人民已走上新生活的光明大道，他们不准许任何人阻止他们前进。
