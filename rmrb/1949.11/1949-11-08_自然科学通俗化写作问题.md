The popular science education work in the Soviet Union is regarded as the "most important part" of communist education. It is believed to have "special and great significance" for breaking superstitions and establishing a materialist ideology. It is also considered to have "special importance" in rural areas, namely to overcome the stubbornness of the older generation towards old methods in production work, and their refusal to accept scientific guidance.

Regarding the content of natural science propaganda, the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) also made a decision in 1944, which was "to explain natural phenomena with materialism and explain the achievements of science, technology, and culture." It also pointed out that all national cultural and educational institutions should participate in this work. In the propaganda, attention should be paid to explaining the greatness of domestic science, strengthening the people's national self-esteem, thereby enhancing the people's confidence in creative ability, eradicating the remaining mentality of flattering foreign goods, and exposing the anti-people face of bourgeois science and the decadent culture of capitalist society.

The direction pointed out by the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) is basically applicable in our people's democratic countries. They have adopted many methods in this regard, and the scale is grand. Among the publications, the works of Ilyin translated into our country have set a good example for us.

Now, because our country's construction work has just begun, the popular science education work, in addition to publishing popular books and periodicals, other forms of propaganda cannot be carried out on a large scale for a while. Publishing, of course, requires writing. Even if all kinds of propaganda in the future are mostly based on popular writing, we should pay attention to the issue of popular science writing now.

In the past, workers in this field were isolated in the liberated and non-liberated areas. The liberated areas were also divided by the enemy, and there was little contact between them, so experience exchange was almost impossible. In the liberated areas, due to the tense struggle against the enemy, there were few people who could be assigned to this work, and reference books were extremely scarce. The masses' demands in this regard were both urgent and complex. Therefore, there were many problems with some of the things that were reluctantly written. In the areas to be liberated, although there were many experts and scientists, they were isolated from the working class and peasants, and could only target middle school students and young intellectuals. Now, it is good that there is no artificial barrier between experts, scientists, and the working masses. We who originally worked in the liberated areas now have more opportunities to learn from experts and scientists, which is a great joy. In order to facilitate the development of popular science propaganda work, I would like to talk about a little experience I have accumulated in the past for your reference:

First, the issue of clarifying the target audience. The popularization of science should, of course, mainly target workers, peasants, and soldiers, but can popular science writing directly target workers, peasants, and soldiers? Generally speaking, it is not possible now. Because only a few workers and soldiers can read, and even fewer peasants can read, which is a great suffering for our China—the difficulty of mastering writing and the low cultural level of the people. When we write such things for the masses, we can only pass it to the masses through cadres, such as primary school teachers, volunteer teachers, agricultural association and trade union cadres, troop cultural teachers, etc., using them as bridges. These cadres are being forced by the masses' desire for knowledge and are eagerly in need of knowledge in this area. In addition, we have a vast number of cadres, military, political, technical, and mass organizations, numbering in the millions. They directly serve the masses, and their learning needs are also very urgent. On the one hand, in order to improve their work, they need to go back and make up for basic knowledge; on the other hand, it is the party's encouragement, call, and urging in learning. Their cry for this kind of nourishment presents our newspapers and periodicals with a new and important task.

Writing for cadres, of course, does not mean ignoring young intellectuals and general technicians. Because the scientific knowledge written for various cadres, which is related to various aspects of practice, is more nutritious for general young intellectuals and middle school students. The basic scientific and technical knowledge of technicians, as well as universally applicable new technical knowledge, are also included. As for detailed and specific technical education, although it should also be popularized, it should not be included in the popularization of science. Of course, the combination of the two is possible, but conceptually it should not be confused. The target of technical education is relatively narrow and should be carried out separately. The target of popular science knowledge publicity need not be divided so finely.

Second, the issue of understanding the target audience. Our cadres are a large number of readers with learning enthusiasm, organization, practical work experience, close contact with the broad masses, political literacy, critical reading ability, ability to responsibly reflect opinions to the author, make demands, and can teach us a lot. They generally lack basic knowledge of natural science, so the nouns and terms used in the readings, even those that have been taught in primary and secondary school textbooks, must be explained, and not too many should be used at once. This is not very different from writing for middle school students and young intellectuals. They do not have the habit of learning for the sake of learning, and they are only interested in learning things that are useful. This can force the author not to deviate from reality, but if the author does not take the initiative, it is easy to become the tail of the readers and give up the instillation of principles and fundamentals. If we compile things like "Know-It-All," "Ask No One," and "Experience Prescriptions" for the masses, we cannot help the masses improve.

Readers generally have poor reading ability, but their comprehension ability is higher. Therefore, the article should be simple and use Chinese grammar. Literary flourishes and Europeanized grammar will increase the burden on readers. It is not necessary to deliberately intersperse unnecessary stories in the article, because the reader wants to honestly learn some knowledge, not for entertainment. If he spends a lot of effort and still can't see the main topic, he will be impatient. One comrade criticized such things as "more soup than meat," which represents the opinion of quite a few comrades.

Our readers are in an environment with very few scientific equipment. They rarely get instruments and specimens, and can almost only "rely on words," so we must say it especially clearly and specifically, and attach as many illustrations as possible. Our readers are quite organized and basically move according to the party's policies. If the party wants to improve the culture of cadres, then cultural readings written with planned and systematic way that understand the needs of cadres will be most welcomed. If the party wants to carry out a rural health campaign, then readings that can solve specific problems of rural health, with theory and practice, can be sold in large quantities. Therefore, our authors must also be organized, understand policies, and provide conditions for the implementation of policies, pave the way, and maintain regular contact with the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Enterprise, trade unions, agricultural associations, and women's and youth organizations. Do not sell them in a disorganized way, so as to avoid wasting the energy and resources of both authors and readers.

Third, the issue of mastering propaganda guidelines. The popularization of natural science writing is to provide goods for the masses. Experts find it hard to buy the experts' original goods, and what they want to buy may not be readily available to the experts. Some are basic courses that experts have long stopped using and may have forgotten; some are beyond the experts' familiarity. In addition, some of the original goods also carry foreign capitalist advertisements, which now have to be carefully considered and washed off.

As for the further hope to avoid idealistic and metaphysical views in the popular science education, and to promote the materialistic dialectical point of view, I am afraid it will be difficult to fully achieve this for a while. However, the realistic revolutionary struggle and revolutionary construction require natural science propaganda to have the necessary dialectical materialistic spirit, that is, to attach enough importance to the subjective initiative of people in overcoming difficulties, and not simply focus on objective conditions. For example, in medical issues, we not only value surgery, drugs, and nutrition, but also value the spiritual encouragement of patients. In fact, it has been proven that a patient's good mood, self-confidence, and conscious good rest and exercise have a great effect on the cure of the disease. We should consciously value this effect. In industrial production, we should also value the enthusiasm and creativity of workers. We should give him encouragement in the work, instead of just talking about objective conditions, which makes people feel helpless in the face of very high objective conditions.

I don't know if the above points are correct, and I hope for guidance from all parties.

　　自然科学通俗化写作问题
    彭庆昭
    自然科学的通俗宣传教育工作，在苏联被看成共产主义教育中的“最重要部分”。认为它对于破除迷信，建立唯物论的思想，具有“特殊伟大的意义”。认为在农村里，则还有“特殊重要”的意义，那便是克服生产工作上，老前辈对于旧方法的固执，不接受科学的指导。
    关于自然科学宣传的内容，联共党中央委员会在一九四四年还作了决定，就是“用唯物论来说明自然现象，讲解科学、技术与文化的成就。”并且指出全国文化教育机关，都应该参加这个工作。在宣传中要注意说明本国科学的伟大性，加强人民民族自尊心，因而增强人民对于创造能力的信心，根绝残余的阿谀外国货的心理，揭露资产阶级科学，和资本主义社会腐朽文化的反人民的面目。
    联共中央指出的这个方向，在我们这些人民民主国家内，基本上也是适用的。他们在这方面所采取的方式很多，并且规模宏大。出版物里面，翻译到我国来的伊林的作品，就给我们作了很好的榜样。
    现在我国因为建设工作刚才开始，自然科学的通俗宣传教育工作，除了出版通俗的书刊以外，别的宣传方式，一时还不能大规模进行。出版当然要有写作，既或将来各种形式的宣传，大都也要以通俗的写作为根据，所以现在就应该注意自然科学的通俗写作问题。
    在过去，解放区和非解放区，这方面的工作者是被隔离着的。解放区之间，也被敌人分割，相互间的联系也少，经验交流简直谈不到。各解放区，因为对敌斗争紧张，能够分配来从事这方面工作的人手也少，参考书又奇缺，群众对这方面的要求，则既迫切、又庞杂，所以勉强写出来的一些东西，有毛病的是不少的。在待解放区，专家、科学家虽很多，但和工农大众隔绝着，只能以中学生、青年知识分子为对象。现在好了，在专家、科学家和劳动大众之间没有人为的阻隔了。我们这些原来在解放区工作的，现在向专家、科学家学习的机会也多了，这是很大的喜事。为了便于展开科学的通俗的宣传工作，我愿把过去积累的一点点经验说一说，供大家参考：
    第一、明确读者对象的问题。科学的通俗宣传，当然要以工农兵为主要对象，但是科学的通俗写作，能不能以工农兵为直接对象呢？一般的说，现在还不能。因为能阅读的工人、士兵是少数，农民能阅读的更少，这是我们中国的一个大苦衷——文字的掌握困难，人民的文化水平低。我们为大众写这类东西，只有通过干部，如小学教员、义务教员、农会工会工作干部、部队文化教员等等，以他们作桥梁送给群众。这些干部正被群众的求知欲所迫，急切需要这方面的知识。此外，我们还有广大的干部群众，军事的、政治的、技术的、群众团体的，数以百万计。他们直接为群众服务，学习要求也很迫切。他们一则为提高工作，要回过头来补习基础知识；再则是党在学习上的鼓励，号召和督促。他们要求这方面食粮的呼欲，就给我们的报纸、刊物，提出一个新的重要的任务。
    为干部写作，当然不是不管青年知识分子，和一般技工等对象。因为给各类干部写的，联系各方面实践的科学知识，对一般青年知识分子、中学生说来，更富有营养价值。技工的基础科学技术知识，以及带普遍性的新技术知识，也是包括在里面的。至于细微具体的技术教育，虽说也应该通俗化，但不应包括在科学的通俗宣传之内。当然，这两者结合是可以的，概念上则不宜混同。技术教育对象比较狭窄，应该分别进行。科学常识的宣传对象，则不必分得很细。
    第二、了解读者对象的问题。我们干部是一个数量庞大，学习热情，有组织性，有实际工作经验，与广大群众密切联系，有政治素养，对读物有批判力，能负责对作者反映意见，提出要求，能教给我们很多东西的、了不起的读者群众。他们一般的缺乏自然科学基础知识，所以读物里面用的名词术语，即使是中小学课本里面讲过的，也要加解释，并且一次不能用的太多。这是和给中学生、青年知识分子写东西不很相同的地方。他们没有为学习而学习的习惯，学的东西要有用才感兴趣。这能迫使作者不脱离实际，但是作者如果不争取主动，就容易成为读者的尾巴，放弃原理、原则的灌输。我们如果给群众编“万事通”“万事不求人”“经验良方”之类的东西，是不能帮助群众提高的。
    读者的阅读能力一般较差，理解力则较高。所以文章要简朴，要用中国语法。舞文弄墨以及欧化的语法，就会增加读者的负担。文章里面不必故意穿插不必要的故事，因为读者是想老老实实学点知识，不是为了消遣。他如果费了半天劲还看不到正题上，就不耐烦。有一位同志就批评那种东西“汤多肉少”，这代表了相当多的同志的意见。
    我们读者所处的环境是很少科学设备的，他们很难得到仪器标本，差不多只能“口说为凭”，所以对他们要说得特别清楚、具体，尽量的附些插图。我们读者是有相当的组织性的，基本上是按照党的政策而运动的。党要提高干部文化，那末，了解干部需要，有计划、有系统写成的文化读物便最受欢迎。党要开展农村卫生运动，那末能解决农村卫生具体问题，有理论、有实际的读物，便能大量销售。所以我们作者也要有组织性，要了解政策，并为政策的执行提供条件，铺平道路，要与卫生部、农业部、企业部、工会、农会、妇女青年的组织经常联系。不要无组织的乱出售，免得作者和读者都浪费精力物力。
    第三、掌握宣传方针的问题。自然科学通俗化写作，是为群众办货。专家原有的货色，他们很难买起，他们要买的，专家不一定现成。有些是专家们久已不用的基础课程，可能丢生了；有的是超出了专家熟习范围。此外，在原有的货色里面，好些还带着外国资本主义的广告，现在得好好考虑一下，洗刷、洗刷。
    至于进一步的希望在自然科学的宣传教育中，避免唯心的、形而上学的观点，宣传唯物辩证的观点，恐怕一时还难以完全办到。不过现实的革命斗争，革命建设，对自然科学宣传，要求具有必要的辩证唯物论的精神，就是对于克服困难中的人的主观能动性，要有足够重视，不单纯着眼于客观条件。比如在医疗问题上，我们不仅重视手术、药物、营养，还重视对病人精神的鼓舞。事实上证明病人精神愉快、自信，并自觉的好好休养、锻炼，对疾病的治愈有很大作用。我们就应该自觉的重视这种作用。在工业生产上，我们对于工人的积极性、创造性也应该重视。在作品里面就给他以鼓舞，而不是光谈客观条件，使人在很高的客观条件面前感到束手无策。
    以上几点意见不知道对不对，希望各方面指教。
