    Capital Public Buses
    Are Gradually Developing
    [Beijing News] The public bus transportation事业 (shìyè - undertaking/cause) in Beijing is gradually recovering and developing. The Beijing Public Bus Company suffered serious damage during the Kuomintang rule and was shut down in July of last year. After the liberation of Beijing, when the Beijing Municipal People's Government took over the company, out of the only 79 buses, only five were barely usable, and the rest were dilapidated. In the past few months, with the help of the People's Government and the continuous efforts of the workers, 48 large buses and 6 trucks have been repaired successively. In May, the route between Dongsi and Xisi was first restored. On October 25th, the route between Qianmen and Lougu was opened. Thirteen buses run on these two lines every day. In order to further develop urban transportation, the company plans to add seven buses this week, striving to have a bus pass every five minutes.

    首都公共汽车
    逐渐发展
    【北京讯】北京市公共汽车交通事业日渐恢复、发展。京市公共汽车公司在国民党统治时期，曾遭到严重破坏，去年七月即已停办。北京解放后，京市人民政府接管该公司时，仅有的七十九辆车中，除五辆尚可勉强使用外，余均破烂不堪。几个月来，在人民政府扶助下，经过工人们不断的努力，先后修复了大轿车四十八辆，卡车六辆，五月份即首先恢复了东四至西四间的路线，十月二十五日更开辟了前门至楼鼓间的路线，每日有十三辆轿车行驰于该两线上。该公司为了更进一步发展市内交通，计划在本周内，陆续增添七辆轿车，争取在每间隔五分钟即可有一辆车通过。
