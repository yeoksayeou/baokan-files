　　Beijing Municipal People's Government Decides
  　Strictly Manage Prices
  　Grain Merchants Summoned Today for Meeting to Announce Important Measures
    North China and Inner Mongolia Sign Grain-Cloth Exchange Contract
    [Beijing News] On the 11th and 12th of this month, due to hoarding, price gouging, and refusal to sell by unscrupulous merchants, prices in Beijing soared to their highest point. Since the 13th, after the People's Government arrested sixteen unscrupulous merchants, grain prices have begun to fall. At the same time, transportation to the Northwest has been opened, and grain sources have been connected, so prices should return to normal. However, on the 16th and 17th, unscrupulous merchants gradually became active again, continuing to push up grain prices. In order to stabilize prices and secure the people's livelihood, the Beijing Municipal People's Government believes that prices should not rise further and has decided to strictly manage prices. It has scheduled a meeting for this afternoon (the 18th) at 1:00 PM at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, summoning the responsible persons of grain stores, rice and flour businesses, mechanized flour mills, and other grain merchants to announce important measures.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 17th] The North China Grain Company recently signed a grain-cloth exchange contract with the Commercial Bureau of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government. The contract stipulates that Inner Mongolia will exchange 50,000 tons of coarse grains for North China's cloth, general merchandise, brick tea, cotton, etc. 30,000 tons will be exchanged this year, and 10,000 tons each in January and March of next year. The first batch of grain has already begun to be shipped from Inner Mongolia after the signing of the contract.

　　京市人民政府决定
  　严格管理物价
  　今召粮商开会宣布重要措施 
    华北内蒙订立粮布交换合同
    【北京讯】京市本月十一、十二两日，由于奸商囤积，抬从拒售，物价暴涨已达最高峰，自十三日人民政府逮捕十六家奸商后，粮价已趋跌落，同时西北交通解禁，粮源已通，物价应趋正常。但十六、十七两日，奸商又渐趋活动，继续哄抬粮价，京市人民政府为稳定物价，安定人民生活，认为目前物价不应再涨，决定严格管理物价，并定于今日（十八）下午一时在市商会召集粮栈业、米面粮业、机制面粉业等粮商负责人开会，宣布重要措施。
    【新华社天津十七日电】华北粮食公司日前与内蒙自治政府商业局签订了粮布交换的合同。合同规定内蒙以五万吨粗粮，换取华北的布匹、百货、砖茶、棉花等。今年交换三万吨，明年一、三月份各交换一万吨。首批粮食于合同签订后已自内蒙开始装运。
