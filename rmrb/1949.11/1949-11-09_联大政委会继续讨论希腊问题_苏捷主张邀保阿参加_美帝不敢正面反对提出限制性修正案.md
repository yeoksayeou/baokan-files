Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 5th: TASS, New York—The United Nations General Assembly Political Committee continued its discussion of the Greek question on October 31st and November 1st.

　　At the beginning of the meeting, the chairman of the committee, Canadian representative Pearson, read a letter from the Bulgarian government requesting that representatives of the Bulgarian government be given the opportunity to attend and speak at the Political Committee meeting during the discussion of the Greek question. Czechoslovak representative Clementis supported the Bulgarian government's request and proposed that the Albanian government also be given the opportunity to attend and speak at the Political Committee meeting during the discussion of the Greek question.

　　U.S. representative Cohen dared not openly oppose inviting representatives from Albania and Bulgaria but proposed a restrictive amendment to the Czech proposal. The U.S. representative also claimed that Albania and Bulgaria should not be given greater rights to participate in the committee's work than they had at last year's General Assembly, because, in his view, "the situation has not changed." The Greek representative immediately repeated the U.S. representative's argument.

　　Soviet representative Malik opposed the restrictive measures proposed in the U.S. amendment. Malik pointed out that representatives from Albania and Bulgaria had actively participated in the work of the Conciliation Committee and that the Political Committee had precedents for inviting representatives to attend meetings. Representatives from Ukraine, Byelorussia, Poland, and other countries also unanimously opposed the U.S. amendment to the Czech proposal.

　　Despite the convincing and justified arguments put forward by the Soviet Union and other countries, the American and British majority violated the general rules of procedure of the committee, put the American-proposed "amendment" to the Czechoslovak proposal to a vote, and passed it.

　　Subsequently, on the recommendation of the chairman, the committee discussed the so-called McNair proposal. This proposal condemns Albania for allegedly firing on "observers" of the so-called Balkan Committee from its territory. The proposal recommends that the Secretary-General request the Albanian government to take measures to stop the "attacks" on the UN "observers." Soviet representative Malik opposed this proposal, calling upon the committee to note that even the "Balkan Conciliation Committee" itself did not deem it necessary to make any requests to the Secretary-General or anyone else, nor for the General Assembly, the Political Committee, or anyone else to take measures on this issue. Therefore, in terms of both procedure and substance, no such issue exists. It is the Greek royalist fascist government that is carrying out provocative attacks on Albanian territory where the observers are located and it is responsible for the safety and necessary conditions of the "Balkan Conciliation Committee" observers.

　　No one publicly supported the British proposal except for McNair himself. McNair said that the purpose of his proposal was merely to prevent similar "incidents" from happening in the future. The chairman put the British proposal to a vote, and it was passed under the clear pressure of the U.S.-British bloc.

　　It is noteworthy that immediately after the vote on the British proposal, the chairman unexpectedly read a statement from the Albanian government, which the committee's delegations had not been aware of while discussing the British proposal. In the statement, the Albanian government firmly denied the slanderous argument that the observers had been shot at by bullets coming from the Albanian border.

　　After the chairman read the letter, Soviet representative Malik said that the letter just read demonstrated how hastily and impartially the Political Committee passes resolutions, how it passes resolutions without hearing the other side, and how the baton of the U.S.-British bloc leaders is at work.

　　Subsequently, the Political Committee continued its general discussion of the Greek question. As the meeting was about to conclude, British representative McNair and U.S. representative Cohen spoke, opposing the Soviet proposals for resolving the Greek question. Both of them issued provocative howls against the Soviet Union's peaceful policies.

　　联大政委会继续讨论希腊问题
  　苏捷主张邀保阿参加
    美帝不敢正面反对提出限制性修正案
    【新华社北京五日电】塔斯社纽约讯：十月三十一日与十一月一日，联合国大会政治委员会继续讨论希腊问题。
    会议开始时，委员会主席加拿大代表皮尔逊宣读保加利亚政府的来信，保加利亚政府请求在讨论希腊问题时，使保加利亚政府的代表有可能出席政治委员会会议和在会上发言。捷克斯洛伐克代表克利门蒂斯支持保加利亚政府的请求，并提议使阿尔巴尼亚政府在讨论希腊问题时，也有可能出席政治委员会会议和在会上发言。
    美国代表柯亨不敢公开反对邀请阿、保代表，但对捷克的提议提出了限制性的修正案。美国代表并声称：不应给阿、保代表以比去年大会上更大的权利来参加委员会的工作，因为照他看来，“情况仍未改变”。希腊代表立即重复美国代表的论点。
    苏联代表马立克反对美国修正案中所提出的限制性的措施。马立克指出，阿、保代表曾积极参加过调解委员会的工作，而且政治委员会曾有邀请代表与会的先例。乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰等国家的代表，也一致反对美国对捷克的提案所提的修正案。
    尽管苏联等国代表提出了令人信服的和正当的论证，而美英多数方面却违犯委员会程序的一般规则，把美国提出的对捷克斯洛伐克建议的“修正案”付诸表决并加以通过。
    接着，根据主席的建议，委员会便讨论所谓麦克奈尔的提案。这提案谴责阿尔巴尼亚，据说是从其国土内射击所谓巴尔干委员会的“观察员”。该提案建议秘书长要求阿政府采取措施，以停止“进攻”联合国“观察员”。苏联代表马立克反对这提案，他吁请委员会注意这种情形，即：甚至是“巴尔干调解委员会”本身，也认为无需向秘书长或任何人提出任何要求，无需由联大、政治委员会或其他任何人对这问题采取措施。因此，就问题的程序与本质来谈，实在没有这样的问题存在。对观察员所在的阿尔巴尼亚领土进行挑衅性攻击的，是希腊保皇法西斯政府，它应对“巴尔干调解委员会”观察员的安全和必需条件负责。
    除了麦克奈尔自己之外，没有一个人公开支持英国的提案。麦克奈尔说：他的提案的目的，只不过是防止同样“事件”在将来发生罢了。主席把英国的提案付诸表决，而这提案就在美英集团明显的压力下被通过了。
    值得注意的是：刚在英国的提案表决过后，主席竟意外地宣读了阿尔巴尼亚政府的声明，而当委员会的各代表团讨论英国提案的时候，却不曾得悉这一声明。在声明里，阿尔巴尼亚政府坚决否认那种说观察员是被从阿尔巴尼亚边境而来的枪弹所射击的这一毁谤性的论辩。
    主席宣读了函件之后，苏联代表马立克说：刚才宣读的这函件说明了政治委员会是怎样匆促和怎样偏袒地通过决定，是怎样未曾听取另一方的话便通过决定，并说明了美英集团指挥者的指挥棒是怎样起着作用。
    随后，政治委员会便继续对希腊问题作一般性的讨论。在会议将告结束时，英国代表麦克奈尔和美国代表柯亨发言，反对苏联关于解决希腊问题的建议。他们两人都发出了反对苏联和平政策的挑拨性的咆哮。
