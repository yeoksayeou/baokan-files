Xinhua News Agency, Rome, 2nd: According to TASS, at the meeting of the Standing Committee of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace on October 29, Fadeyev, head of the Soviet delegation and one of the vice-chairmen of the Standing Committee, delivered a speech.

　　Fadeyev, on behalf of the Soviet delegation to the Standing Committee, expressed his approval of the activities of the Standing Committee since the World Congress of Supporters of Peace, and expressed his gratitude for the selfless work of the Chairman of the Standing Committee, Joliot-Curie.

　　Fadeyev pointed out that the movement of people of all ethnic groups to strive for peace has won considerable success during this period. The number of peace fighters around the world is increasing day by day, national peace movements are expanding, and the Standing Committee's ties with national committees are also increasing day by day.

　　In his speech, Fadeyev spoke about his recent impressions of visiting China. He said: "Recently, I attended the Chinese People's Conference for the Defence of World Peace as a guest. I learned how strongly the Chinese people desire to peacefully build their independent and democratic new country and their culture, desire to live in friendship with all the peoples of the world, desire to defend their country and nation, so that their country and nation will not suffer again from the imperialist military aggression that has caused the Chinese people so much suffering in the recent century, and finally desire to defend world peace together with all the people on earth."

　　Fadeyev then emphasized and reminded that although the cause of world peace has achieved great success, it would be too naive to be complacent about this and think that the danger of war has disappeared. War-mongers are out-and-out war-mongers. Their injustice and brutal bestiality are increasing, and they are making full use of the hesitation of some frustrated people, and are taking many devilish, malicious and brutal means to oppose the growing forces of peace. These means are: maintaining incomparably large armaments, so that the people of many nations still live in poverty; not only trampling on the rights of small countries, but also formulating military pacts and alliances that damage the dignity of the great French and Italian people; dividing the most developed western region of Germany, and establishing a puppet government, attempting to turn this land of the German people into a bridgehead for new wars; brutally suppressing the national independence movements of the heroic Greek, Vietnamese and Indonesian people, and carrying out unprecedentedly cruel terror against the best sons and daughters of these countries; bribing and arming mercenary groups such as the Tito group, directing espionage and sabotage activities in peace-loving countries, and inciting war in the people's democratic countries of Europe; increasingly promoting national chauvinism and hatred, as well as racial discrimination that undermines the dignity of hundreds of millions of people; and finally, and more and more unscrupulously, carrying out propaganda for new wars, and declaring the use of various most inhuman weapons to massacre women and children as virtue.
　　
　　War-mongers' brutal bestiality is increasing and must respond to and assist the struggle of peaceful forces

　　Fadeyev pointed out that although the movement to defend peace has made great progress in many countries, there are still some countries where the people undoubtedly desire peace, but their efforts are still not united and organized sufficiently. The reason for this is that in some countries, it is due to the barbaric suppression of the peace movement by their governments; in other countries, it is due to the shortcomings of the domestic progressive forces of peace in ideological enlightenment and organizational work, and because our Standing Committee has not given them enough help; and also because of the special circumstances of economic and cultural development in these countries.

　　Fadeyev said that despite the various successes of the cause of peace in some countries, despite the respect for the activities of the progressive forces in these countries in this regard, the people of the world are undoubtedly waiting for much greater achievements, and they are placing their greatest hopes on the joint movement for peace in countries such as the United States and Britain, such as Canada, the various countries of Latin America, and many countries that are still in the status of colonies and dependent countries. Undoubtedly, the national peace committees of these countries and the Standing Committee of our World Congress of Supporters of Peace can give them much greater assistance in the struggle of the people of these countries for peace.

　　Tito is hired by American and British war-mongers and his conspiracy will surely be thoroughly exposed

　　After that, Fadeyev talked about the Tito group and the Yugoslav Peace Committee. He said: Who would doubt that among the most excellent sons and daughters in Yugoslavia and those who have been forced to flee because of the barbaric terror of the Tito group, no less than the German secret police, are the true forces of Yugoslavia who support peace? The Standing Committee of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace must support these forces and extend a helping hand to them. It is said that in some countries, there are still some upright people who do not understand that Tito and his entire group are hired by war-mongers. This is not surprising. First of all, Tito, like all hired agents, has long disguised himself, and is still disguising himself in order to deceive upright people. He is neither the first nor the last of the fascist figures who, in order to deceive the people and achieve power and then enslave the people, have been and are still talking endlessly about the socialism that they are supposedly fighting for. Here, in Italy, we can leave it without further elaboration, because Mussolini started his career in exactly this way. Secondly, it has now been some time that all the newspapers in Western Europe and the United States that are controlled by war-mongers or maintain a suspicious servility and courtesy with them, have placed Tito and the Titoists under their protection, and this has helped to confuse upright people. Undoubtedly, the task of the Standing Committee is to explain to all upright people Tito's role as an agent hired by American imperialism, whose hands are not only stained with the blood of his own people, but also with the blood of the Greek people; and to explain Tito's role as a puppet of American imperialism, as a war-monger who carries out secret subversive activities in Yugoslavia's neighboring countries for the benefit of his masters.

　　Fadeyev said: This is why our Soviet representatives to the Standing Committee support the completely just resolution adopted by the Committee on October 18 this year, which decided to break with the Yugoslav National Committee that implements war policies under the cover of false words of defending peace. We support to the same extent the Standing Committee's decision not to allow the current Yugoslav representatives to participate in the current plenary session of the Committee held here. With the same determination, we support the proposals of the National Peace Committees of many countries that the representatives of the Tito group, who are hostile to the cause of peace, must be expelled from the Standing Committee of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace.

　　Fadeyev finally said: Let me, on behalf of the Soviet delegation, pay tribute to all the members of the Standing Committee here, and through you to the peace supporters all over the world, and assure you that we, the Soviet people, always have a sincere and deep respect for the national development of every nation, and always maintain the full energy that the Soviet people are born with, and join you in maintaining the cause of peace until complete victory.

　　世界和平大会常委会议上
  　法捷耶夫发表演说
    畅谈所见中国人民保卫民主和平决心表示苏联维护和平事业直到完全胜利
    【新华社北京二日电】据塔斯社罗马讯：在世界拥护和平大会常设委员会十月二十九日的会议上，苏联代表团团长、常设委员会副主席之一法捷耶夫发表了演说。
    法捷耶夫代表常设委员会中的苏联代表团，表示赞同从世界拥护和平大会以来的常设委员会的活动，并表示感激常设委员会主席约里奥——居里的忘我的工作。
    法捷耶夫指出：各族人民争取和平的运动，在这一期间已赢得了相当大的成功，世界各地和平斗士的数目正在日益增加，全国性的和平运动正在扩展中，而常设委员会与各国全国委员会的联系也正在日益增强。
    法捷耶夫在演说中谈到他最近访问中国的观感。他说：“最近，我曾以来宾的资格出席了中国保卫世界和平大会，我得知中国人民是如何强烈地愿望和平地建设他们独立民主的新国家和他们的文化，愿望在和世界各族人民的友谊中生活，愿望保卫他们的国家与民族，使他们的国家与民族免于再度遭受在最近这一世纪中使中国人民备受痛苦的帝国主义军事侵略，并且最后还愿望与地球上一切人民在一起保卫世界和平。”
    法捷耶夫继而强调地提醒说：世界和平事业虽已获得巨大的成功，但是，如果以此自满，并以为战争的危险已经消逝，那就太天真了。战争贩子就是不折不扣的战争贩子。他们的不义及凶残的兽性正有增无已，他们正利用一些颓丧的人们的犹豫不前，在全力采取许多魔鬼般的恶毒凶残的手段，来反对日益增长的和平力量。这些手段便是：保持无比大的军备，使得许多民族的人民依然生活在匮乏之中；不只是蹂躏了小国的权利，而且也制订了损伤伟大的法兰西和意大利人民的尊严的军事公约与联盟；分割了德国工业最发达的西部地区，并建立了傀儡政府，企图把这块德国人民的土地变为新战争的桥头堡垒；残暴镇压英勇的希腊、越南和印尼人民的民族独立运动，对这些国家人民的最优秀的儿女们进行空前的残酷恐怖；贿买并武装铁托集团之类的雇佣集团，在爱好和平的国家中指挥间谍和怠工活动，并在欧洲的人民民主国家中煽动战争；越来越更加鼓吹民族沙文主义和仇恨，以及破坏亿万人民尊严的种族歧视；最后，并越来越肆无忌惮地进行新战争的宣传，把使用各种最不人道的武器大批屠杀妇女和儿童暴行宣称为美德。
　　战贩凶残兽性正有增无已和大应援助和平力量斗争
    法捷耶夫指出：虽然在许多国家中保卫和平的运动已有巨大的进展，但是还有一些国家，那里的人民无疑是渴望和平的，但他们的努力却仍然团结和组织得不够充分，究其原因，在某些国家，是由于他们政府对和平运动进行野蛮的镇压在其他国家则是由于国内进步的和平力量在思想启发和组织工作上有缺点，是由于我们常设委员会给与他们的帮助不够；也还因为这些国家的经济和文化发展的特殊情况。
    法捷耶夫说：尽管在一些国家中和平事业有着各种成功，尽管有着对这些国家进步力量在这方面所作活动的崇敬，但是世界各民族无疑的都在等待着更加大得多的成就，他们正把最大的希望寄托在象美国和英国、象加拿大、拉丁美洲各国以及许多现在还是在殖民地和附属国地位的国家共同争取和平的运动上面。无疑的，这些国家的全国拥护和平委员会和我们的世界拥护和平大会常设委员会，在这些国家人民争取和平的斗争中，可以给与他们更加大得多的援助。
  　铁托为美英战贩雇用和大必将予彻底揭露
    其后，法捷耶夫谈到铁托集团与南斯拉夫和平委员会的问题，他说：谁会怀疑在南斯拉夫国内和那些因为铁托集团的不下于德国秘密警察的野蛮恐怖而被迫逃亡的最优秀的儿女中，有着南斯拉夫拥护和平的真正力量呢？世界拥护和平大会常设委员会必须支持这些力量，并向他们伸出援助的手。据说，在某些国家里，仍然有些正直的人们不了解铁托及其整个集团是为战争贩子所雇用的。这一点并无足惊讶。首先，铁托象一切被雇用的代理人一样，老早就伪装起来了，并且现在还是伪装着，以便欺骗正直的人们。他既不是头一个也不是法西斯人物的最后一个，他们为了欺骗人民和达到当权并继之以奴役人民，过去和现在便都在喋喋不休地谈论着据说他们在为之奋斗的社会主义。在这里，在意大利，我们就可以不用赘述了，因为墨索里尼正是用这种方法开始他的生涯的。其次，现在已经是有了一些时候了，西欧和美国为战争贩子所控制的或是以可疑的卑躬屈膝和殷勤与他们保持一致的全部报纸，都把铁托和铁托分子置于其庇护之下，而这是有助于迷惑正直的人们的。无疑的，和大常设委员会的任务，是要向一切正直的人们解释铁托的作为受美国帝国主义雇用的代理人的作用，他的手上不仅已染上他本国人民的鲜血，并且也染上了希腊人民的鲜血；并要解释铁托作为美国帝国主义的傀儡，作为一个为其主子的利益而在南斯拉夫邻国中进行秘密的颠覆性活动的战争贩子的作用。
    法捷耶夫说：这就是我们常设委员会的苏联代表，为什么拥护委员会在本年十月十八日所采取的、完全正义性的决议的理由，这一决议决定与在保卫和平的虚伪词句的掩护下执行战争政策的南斯拉夫全国委员会决裂。我们在同样的程度上拥护常设委员会的不容许现时的南斯拉夫代表参加现在此间举行的委员会全会的决议。我们以同样的决心，拥护许多国家的全国和平委员会的关于必须把敌对和平事业的铁托集团的代表驱逐出世界拥护和平大会常设委员会的提议。
    法捷耶夫最后说：让我代表苏联代表团在这里向常设委员会的全体委员、并通过你们向全世界的和平拥护者致敬，并向你们保证：我们苏联人民经常都是对每一个民族的民族发展怀着真诚的和深深的尊敬，并且经常怀有苏联人民生来就具有的全副精力，与你们一同维护和平事业直到完全胜利为止。（附图片）
