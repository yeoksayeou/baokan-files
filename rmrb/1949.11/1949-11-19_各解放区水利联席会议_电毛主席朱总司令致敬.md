Cables Greetings to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu

[Beijing News] The All Liberated Areas Water Conservancy Joint Conference sent a telegram of respect to Chairman Mao. The telegram reads as follows: Respected Chairman Mao:

We, the water conservancy workers from the liberated areas of East China, Central China, Northeast China, Northwest China, and North China, are attending the All Liberated Areas Water Conservancy Joint Conference in Beijing, the people's capital, and we feel infinite joy and excitement. Here, we have reported on the water conservancy work in various regions, exchanged work experiences, and extensively exchanged views on future water conservancy construction issues. We have put forward the 1950 water conservancy construction plan, and it has successfully concluded today. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and you, the Chinese people have undergone arduous and bloody struggles, and finally liberated themselves from the oppression and exploitation of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. This great victory has shown an infinitely bright prospect for the people's water conservancy cause. All of us representatives would like to pay you the highest respect. We will unswervingly unite under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and you, rely on the broad masses, solve the water disaster problems that China has failed to solve for thousands of years in a step-by-step manner, and develop water conservancy to the maximum extent to increase industrial and agricultural production, prosper the new democratic economy, and improve people's lives.
