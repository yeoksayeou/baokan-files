　　[Our Newspaper] News: Zhang Xiaomei, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Municipal Women's Federation, presented a summary of women's work in Beijing since liberation and outlined future work guidelines at the First Beijing Municipal Women's Congress on the 27th.

　　In the past nine months, in accordance with the resolutions of the First National Women's Congress this spring, the Municipal Women's Federation initially focused its efforts on the work of female workers, and then gradually paid attention to mobilizing and organizing the vast number of working women to participate in production.

　　Educating and Organizing Female Workers, Improving Production Quality

　　In terms of female worker work, the Municipal Women's Federation selected key factories with a higher percentage of female workers and dispatched work teams to assist the preparatory committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions in carrying out organizational and educational work. According to recent statistics, there are a total of 4,887 female workers in public and private industries, handicrafts, and shop assistants in the city. Among them, 3,990 have joined trade unions and approximately 4,000 have participated in learning activities. Through learning, female workers have begun to break down feudal ideas and fatalistic views, and have transformed their attitudes of belittling labor and dependency. New labor attitudes have been established, and the quality of production has gradually improved. For example, the average daily output of female workers in the Second Clothing Factory has increased from 4.5 sets per person to 7.8 sets. In the first phase of winter clothing production this year, female workers accounted for half of the 214 people who received bonus for over-fulfilling production quotas in the sewing department of the First Clothing Factory, and the third shift of female workers won the runner-up red flag in the factory-wide competition. Currently, 844 female workers in various factories have been elected as leaders of trade union groups or above, and 158 of them serve as cadres above the level of trade union committee members. They have all played a backbone and leadership role in their work.

　　The production work led by the Municipal Women's Federation is carried out in three key areas: first, transforming and rectifying women's handicraft factories; second, establishing embroidery and mending factories; and third, organizing approximately 3,000 women in various districts to participate in production (detailed introductions of the above three items were published in this newspaper from the 27th to the 29th, see page 2).

　　Maternal and Child Health Work Guidelines: Focusing on the Broad Working Women

　　In terms of maternal and child welfare work, the number of public and private nurseries in the city has increased from 11 before liberation to 43. The Women's Federation conducted a preliminary survey and understanding of the nurseries in the city, held symposiums for childcare workers to jointly study business and exchange experience; and established a small-scale training class for childcare personnel in the Beihai Nursery. It also jointly established a maternal and child health experimental zone with the Municipal Health Bureau outside Chongwenmen, systematically conducting family condition and disease surveys, maternal and child health education, and disease treatment. In the work, the Municipal Women's Federation clarified that maternal and child health should be oriented towards the working women.

　　In terms of publicity and education, the Municipal Women's Federation has widely conveyed the resolutions of the National Women's Congress and the First Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference in the past nine months, carried out internationalism and patriotism education, and promoted gender equality and freedom of marriage. In addition, it has jointly studied the issue of women's literacy classes with the Municipal Education Bureau, compiled the first draft of the first women's textbook, and published the "Beijing Women" monthly magazine.

　　In addition, the Women's Federation assisted in the organizational and educational work of female students and teachers, and sent cadres to suburban areas to participate in peasant association work, emphasizing the joint mobilization of men and women to participate in land reform and production.

　　The experience gained by the Municipal Women's Federation from its work is that women's work cannot be entirely done directly by the Women's Federation. Therefore, it must be carried out through relevant departments. For example, female worker work should be promoted by the female worker department of the trade union in order to closely integrate with the central work of the trade union.

　　Regarding the future work guidelines, Zhang Xiaomei said: We must continue to implement the resolutions of the National Women's Congress, take female workers as the foundation, unite other working women, strive for intellectual women and women from other strata, form a broad and solid united front, eliminate reactionary remnants, improve women's political and cultural level, keep pace with all the people of Beijing, assist the People's Government in promoting economic and cultural undertakings, and protect the rights and interests of women and children, realize gender equality and freedom of marriage, and strive to build a new capital for the people.

　　Must Promote Relevant Departments to Jointly Carry Out Women's Work

　　Regarding the issue of women's organizational forms: Zhang Xiaomei said: Organized women, such as women from trade unions, peasant associations, student unions, teacher unions, youth leagues, youth federations, medical associations, and other organizations, should have their female members represented in the Women's Federation by the women's departments of their respective organizations as group members. The Women's Federation should absorb the heads of the women's departments of various organizations (or, if there is no women's department, the responsible female committee members) as members of the executive committee or standing committee of the Women's Federation, so as to convey and implement the resolutions of the Women's Federation through them, and reflect the work situation and mass demands of each organization. All organizations that include a considerable number of female members should ensure that women are elected as committee members and establish women's departments to lead women's work. The women's departments can convene regular or ad hoc women's representative meetings of various departments, industries, or joint meetings as needed to convey resolutions, arrange work, and discuss and resolve the special problems and demands of women. The representatives of the women's representative meetings should be elected by the masses and can be fixed or unfixed.

　　For unorganized women, women's representative meetings for the whole district and various industries should be organized by district, without the need to organize street representative meetings. The women's representative meeting for the whole district is a comprehensive organization, and its foundation is the representative meetings of various industries (referring to their family occupations). The women's representative meeting committees of each district can participate in the Municipal Women's Federation as group members.

　　[Beijing News] The First Beijing Municipal Women's Congress continued yesterday (28th). The agenda of the congress in the morning was for representatives to speak and discuss the report of Zhang Xiaomei, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Municipal Women's Federation; in the afternoon, the "Charter of the Beijing Democratic Women's Federation" (full text see separate article) and the "Election Law of the First Executive Committee of the Beijing Democratic Women's Federation" were discussed and approved, and the review report of the proposal review committee was discussed. The speaking representatives included female workers, suburban peasant women, urban working women, educators, students, childcare workers, medical workers, cultural and artistic workers, group representatives, troops, government agencies, and ethnic minority women representatives, totaling 33 people. They unanimously supported Mayor Nie's instructions and Zhang Xiaomei's report, and were willing to work hard to implement the resolutions of the congress.

　　In the afternoon, the proposal review committee reported the results of the proposal review. The congress received a total of 170 proposals related to childcare and health, women's welfare, production, organization, publicity and education, etc., which were sorted and merged into 47 items. After the report, it was unanimously approved by all representatives. During the congress yesterday, 15 units including Fu Jen Catholic University Kindergarten, Jianying Nursery, Xiangshan Ciyouyuan, Hui Muslim women, and the Mongolian and Tibetan School presented flags, flowers, congratulatory messages, and gifts to the congress.

　　京市妇联筹委会主任张晓梅
    总结京妇女工作
  　妇女代表热烈讨论一致拥护
    【本报讯】北京市民主妇联筹委会主任张晓梅二十七日在北京市第一次妇女代表大会上报告了北京市解放以来妇女工作的总结及今后的工作方针。
    九个月来，市妇联根据今春第一次全国妇代大会的决议，首先把力量放在女工工作上，随后逐渐注意了发动与组织广大的劳动妇女参加生产。
    教育组织女工　提高生产质量
    在女工工作方面，市妇联曾选择重点派遣工作组，协助市总工会筹委会在女工较多的工厂进行了组织和教育工作。据最近统计，全市公私营产业、手工业和店员女工共四八八七人，已参加工会的有三九九○人，参加学习的约四千人。经过学习的女工，封建思想和宿命观点开始打破，轻视劳动与依赖思想转变了；新的劳动态度建立起来，生产质量已逐步提高。如被服二厂女工平均由每人每日生产四·五套提高到七·八套；被服一厂缝纫部在今年第一期冬装任务中，得到超额奖金的二一四人中女工占半数，女工第三班并获得全厂竞赛的亚军红旗。目前各厂女工被选为工会小组长以上的共八四四人，其中一五八人担任工会委员以上干部，她们在工作中都起了骨干和领导作用。
    市妇联领导的生产工作，分三个重点进行：一是改造整顿妇女手工厂；二是创办挑补花工厂；三是组织各区妇女三千人左右参加生产。（以上三项本报二十七日至二十九日，有专文介绍，见第二版）。
    妇婴卫生工作方针　面向广大劳动妇女
    妇婴福利工作方面，全市公私立托儿所已由解放前的十一处增至四十三处，妇联对本市各托儿所进行了初步的调查了解，举办保育工作者座谈会，以共同研究业务，交流经验；并在北海托儿所成立了小规模的保育人员训练班，又与市卫生局在崇文门外合办了一个妇婴卫生实验区，有步骤地进行家庭状况、疾病调查、妇婴卫生教育和疾病治疗。在工作中，市妇联明确了妇婴卫生应面向劳动妇女的工作方针。
    在宣传教育上，市妇联在过去九个月中，曾广泛地传达了全国妇代和京市第一次各界代表会议的决议，作了国际主义与爱国主义的教育与男女平等、婚姻自由的宣传。此外与市教育局等共同研究妇女识字班问题，编出了第一册妇女课本初稿，出版了“北京妇女”月刊。
    此外，妇联协助了女学生与女教职员的组织教育工作，并派干部去郊区参加农会工作，强调提出男女一齐发动，参加土改与生产。
    市妇联从工作中得到的经验是：妇女工作不可能完全由妇联直接去作，因此，必须通过各有关部门进行，如女工工作应推动工会女工部去作，以便与工会中心工作密切结合进行。
    关于今后的工作方针：张晓梅说：我们必须继续贯彻全国妇代大会的决议，以女工为基础，团结其他劳动妇女，争取知识妇女及其他各阶层妇女，结成广泛巩固的统一战线，肃清反动残余，提高妇女的政治文化水平，与北京全体人民齐一步伐，协助人民政府推进经济与文化事业，并保护妇女儿童权益，实现男女平等，婚姻自由，为建设人民的新首都而奋斗。
    必须推动有关部门　共同开展妇女工作
    关于妇女组织形式问题：张晓梅说：有组织的妇女，如工会、农会、学联会、教联会、青年团、青联、医协等团体的妇女，应以该团体的妇女部代表其女会员全体参加妇联为团体会员，妇联则应吸收各团体的妇女部负责人或（如无妇女部）负责的妇女委员为妇联的执委或常委，以便通过她们传达和执行妇联决议，并反映各该团体的工作情况与群众要求。凡包括相当数量妇女会员的团体，应保证有妇女当选为委员，并建立妇女部领导妇女工作。妇女部可按工作需要，定期或不定期召开各部门的、各行业的或联合性的妇女代表会议，以传达决议，布置工作，讨论和解决妇女的特殊问题与要求。妇女代表会议的代表应由群众选出，固定或不固定均可。
    对无组织的妇女群众，应分区组织全区的和各行业的妇女代表会议，不须组织街的代表会议。全区妇女代表会议是一种综合性的组织，它的基础是各行业（指其家庭职业）的代表会议。各区的区妇女代表会议委员会可参加市妇联为团体会员。
    【北京讯】北京市第一次妇女代表大会昨（二十八日）继续进行。大会议程上午为代表发言，讨论市妇联筹委会主任张晓梅的报告；下午讨论并通过“北京市民主妇女联合会章程”（全文见另条）、“北京市民主妇联第一届执行委员会选举法”，并讨论提案审查委员会审查报告。大会发言代表包括女工、郊区农妇、市区劳动妇女、教育工作者、学生、保育工作者、医务工作者、文化艺术工作者、团体代表、部队、机关及少数民族妇女代表等共计三十三人。一致拥护聂市长的指示和张晓梅的报告，并愿为贯彻大会的决议而努力。
    下午提案审查委员会报告提案审查结果，大会共收到有关保育卫生、妇女福利、生产、组织、宣传教育等类提案共一百七十件，经整理合并为四十七件。报告后，经全体代表一致通过。昨日大会进行中，有辅仁大学幼稚园、健婴托儿所、香山慈幼院、回民妇女、蒙藏学校等十五单位向大会献旗、献花、献贺词和礼品。
