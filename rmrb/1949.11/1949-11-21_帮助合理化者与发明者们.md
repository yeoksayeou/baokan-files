　　Help Rationalizers and Inventors
　　*Soviet Labor Newspaper Editorial*
　　*(Translated by He Hong)*
　　In every enterprise, in every factory, in any sector of production, wherever Soviet people are working, the flame of creative initiative is burning unceasingly. Among our male and female workers, foremen, and engineers, there are many innovators. Yesterday's achievements no longer satisfy them today. Therefore, they are constantly seeking new and updated ways to improve labor productivity, improve the quality of products, and use equipment and raw materials more rationally. In our country (referring to the Soviet Union - translator), the number of inventors and rationalizers—untiring innovators—is increasing day by day.
    In the capitalist world, the results of rationalization and invention cannot bring any hope to workers other than the "prospect" of being abandoned on the streets. Capitalist rationalization only serves to increase the wealth of capitalists. Here, invention and rationalization push forward socialist industry, help to further strengthen our motherland's strength, lighten the people's labor, and improve the well-being of the working people.
    For the development of the invention and rationalization movement, large sums of money are spent in the Soviet Union. Soviet inventors have the broadest possible opportunities to increase their knowledge and skills, with books on experiments and libraries of technical science available to them, and a large number of experts in various fields of science and technology to help them. In our country, innovators are glorious and respected by everyone. Many worker-inventors and rationalizers have won Stalin Prizes for their creative labor, and their experience has been widely applied in production. Our scientists also utilize these experiences.
    Regularly helping production innovators is the direct responsibility of the trade union committees. The Tenth All-Union Trade Union Congress, in its resolution, charged all trade union organizations to "improve the work of further promoting the mass invention and rationalization movement, and resolutely combat the negligence of leaders who hinder the adoption of valuable suggestions."
    The "Workers' Mass Invention and Rationalization Committees" attached to the various factory committees play an important role in solving this task. They should involve male and female workers, engineers, technicians, and staff in the rationalization movement, and suggest to innovators the primary and most urgent problems to be solved in production. They are responsible for paying close attention to ensure that no suggestion is left unexamined. They should safeguard the interests of innovators and strive to ensure that the authors of technical improvements or rationalization proposals that have been adopted in production receive remuneration commensurate with the circumstances.
    The actual practice of the "Workers' Mass Invention and Rationalization Committees" is multifaceted and diverse. Here, a large part depends on the skills of organizational work. In the "Moscow Lenin Order Electric Lamp Factory," the committee was able to organize a broad group of activists among inventors and rationalizers, who not only worked on their own suggestions, but also frequently helped the committee to attract new male and female workers into the innovation movement and provided practical assistance in realizing their creative designs. Because of the close contact with the factory's engineers, technicians, and scientific research institutions in their work, the committee was able to guide the wisdom of innovators to solve the most important problems. The committee closely linked its activities with the factory's worker invention department, design department, and other departments related to the adoption of new technologies.
    The successful experience of the "Moscow Red Banner Order Hard Alloy Joint Factory" is well-known. There, the organization of comprehensive innovation work groups was widely developed. These work groups, including workers, engineers, and designers, could solve complex technical problems, help overcome production difficulties, and bring a large amount of capital savings to the entire enterprise in order to complete the plan ahead of schedule. It should be noted that it was the "Workers' Mass Invention and Rationalization Committee" of the Joint Factory's factory committee that launched the organization of the comprehensive work groups. This committee also regularly assisted the work groups. The Central Committee of the Non-Ferrous Metals Industry Trade Union has done a lot to promote the experience of the comprehensive work groups.
    In some factories, "special topics" are of great benefit to innovators. These "topics" are essentially social orders to innovators. Experience has shown that these "topics" help to quickly solve many technical problems and point out the correct direction for the work of inventors and rationalizers.
    Comrade S. A. Odatov, a reader of *Labor Newspaper*, wrote: At the Riga Meat Cannery, rationalization work had been neglected, and workers' suggestions were rarely adopted and implemented. Later, after proposing "topics" (including urgent problems to be solved in production) and widely familiarizing the workers with these topics, many valuable suggestions were implemented in a few days. They were all reviewed, approved, and then discussed and implemented. The "topic" system at the "Red Rose Silk Weaving Joint Factory" also produced positive results. In this factory, under the auspices of the committee, the "topics" were systematically organized.
    The "Workers' Mass Invention and Rationalization Committees" should submit suggestions from innovators to production meetings for discussion, and utilize some materials and various models at the meetings to guide the workers' creative wisdom in the required direction. One of the committee's most important responsibilities is to regularly urge the completion of tasks contained in collective consultations regarding the implementation of suggestions and the improvement of production work.
    Experience and practice show that the innovation movement is particularly promoted in those places where the work of the "Workers' Mass Invention and Rationalization Committees" has absorbed active elements from male and female workers, foremen, engineers, and technicians; where the committees are proactive and active; and where various forms and methods of mass work are insisted upon—issuing "topics," conducting competitions, exhibitions, and organizing the exchange of experience among advanced workers.
    Comrade Molotov said at the Eighteenth Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks): "We will discover new and huge reserves, as long as we can show real concern for our many inventors, rationalizers, and their assistants, and actively, with material and social methods, encourage and promote this kind of thing, according to Comrade Stalin's instructions." The glorious task of the trade union organizations is to—use all methods to help rationalizers and inventors carry out their patriotic work.

### 帮助合理化者与发明者们

　　帮助合理化者与发明者们
    苏联劳动报社论
　　何红译
    在每一个企业里，在每一个工厂中，在任何生产的部门，凡在有苏维埃人民劳动着的一切地方，都不熄地燃烧着创造性的进取精神的火焰。在我们的男女工人、工头、工程师当中有许多的创新者。他们昨天的成就，到今天就不能再满足他们了。因此，他们不停地寻找着新的与更新的途径来提高劳动生产率，改进生产品底品质，更合理地使用设备与原料。在我国（指苏联——译者），发明者，合理化者——不倦的创新者们底数目是与日俱增的。
    在资本主义世界，合理化与发明的结果，不能带给工人以任何的指望，除了被弃于街头这样一个“前途”之外。资本主义的合理化只效劳于资本家财富底增加。我们这里，发明与合理化则往前推动着社会主义的工业，帮助进一步增强我们祖国底力量，减轻人民底劳动，提高劳动者底生活福利。
    为了发明与合理化运动底发展，在苏联，化费着大量的金钱，苏维埃发明者们得以有最广阔的可能来增进自己的知识技能，有讲实验的书籍及技术科学的图书馆供他们使用，有大批的各种门类的科学与技术的专家们帮助他们。在我国，创新者是光荣的，是人人所敬仰的。许多工人发明者与合理化者因其创造性的劳动而获得斯大林奖金，他们底经验得到广泛的在生产上的应用。我们的科学家也利用这些经验。
    经常地帮助生产的创新者是职工会委员会底直接的责任。第十次全苏职工会代表大会在其决议中责成各个职工会底组织“改进进一步推展群众性的发明与合理化运动的工作，对那些妨碍了有价值的建议底采用的领导者们底怠惰进行坚决的斗争”。
    在解决这个任务中担任重要角色的是附属于各个工厂委员会的“工人群众发明与合理化委员会”。他们应该吸收男女工人、工程师、技师、职员到合理化运动中来，并向创新者们提示生产中的首要的最需要解决的问题。他们有责任密切注意，务必不要使任何一个建议搁置不经审查。他们应保障创新者底利益，力求使那些在生产中已经采用的技术改进或合理化建议底作者们，得到与当时情况相当的报酬。
    “工人群众发明与合理化委员会”底工作底实际作法是多方面的多样的，这里。很大的一部分是要靠组织工作的技能。在“莫斯科列宁动章电灯工厂”，委员会就能把发明者与合理化者中的广大的积极分子组织了起来，他们不仅是按着自己的建议来劳动，而且更经常地帮助委员会把新的男女工人吸收到创新运动里来，并在他们实现自己创造性的设计时予以实际的帮助。因为在工作上有密切接触着工厂的工程师技术人员们和科学经验机关，所以委员会能够把创新者们底智慧引导去解决最重要的问题。委员会在其活动中紧密地连系着工厂底工人发明科和设计部门以及其他与采取新技术有关的部门。
    “莫斯科红旗勋章硬合金联合工厂”底成功的经验是有名的。在那里，广泛展开了创新者的综合工作组的组织。这种工作组，包括有工人、工程师、设计师，能解决复杂的技术问题，帮助克服生产中的难题，给整个企业带来大量的资金储蓄以备提前完成计划。应该注意的，是发动组织综合工作组的是联合工厂工厂委员会底“工人群众发明与合理化委员会”。这委员会也经常地帮助着各工作组。有色金属业职工会中央委员会为了推广综合工作组的经验，曾作过不少事情。
    在一些工厂中，“专门题目”对创新者有很大益处。这些“题目”本质上就是社会对创新者的命令。经验证明，这种“题目”有助于最迅速地解决许多技术问题，并给发明者与合理化者底工作指出了正确的方向。
    “劳动报”底读者斯奥达托夫同志写道：在里加肉食罐头联合工厂曾经忽视过合理化的工作，工人的建议很少被采纳实行。后来，在提出“题目”（包括有生产中急待解决的问题），并广泛地使工人熟知这些题目之后，在不多的几天之中就有许多有价值的建议实现了。它们都经过审查，批准，然后讨论实行。在“红玫瑰丝织联合厂”出“题目”也同样地产生了积极的结果。在这个工厂里，在委员会的主持之下，“题目”都有系统地组织起来了。
    “工人群众发明与合理化委员会”应把来自创新者的建议在生产会议上提付讨论，并在会议上利用一些材料及各种样子来引导工人底创造的智慧到需要的方向。委员会最重要的责任之一就是经常地督促完成关于实现建议，提高生产工作的集体会同中所载的任务。
    经验与实践证明，创新运动在那些地方得到特别的推广：那里“工人群众发明与合理化委员会”底工作吸收了男女工人、工头、工程师、技师中的积极分子；那里委员会是主动的积极的，那里坚持了各种不同的群众工作的形式和方法——出“题目”，进行竞赛，展览会，组织广泛的进步工人的经验交换。
    莫洛托夫同志在十八次联共（布）党代表大会上说过：“我们将发现新的庞大的后备力量，只要我们能对我们众多的发明者，合理化者以及他们的助手表示真正的关心，应该积极地，用物质的和社会的方法，按着斯大林同志的指示，鼓励并推动这种事情。”职工会组织底光荣的任务就是——用一切方法帮助合理化者与发明者进行他们爱国主义的工作。
