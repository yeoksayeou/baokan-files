Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, November 24th: The All-Circles Representative Conference of Mancheng County, Hebei Province, opened on November 5th and concluded on the 7th. In a very short period, the conference concentrated on resolving the levy issue that the masses urgently demanded to be resolved, and discussed the winter production plan proposed by the government. Through repeated discussions by representatives from all strata, the government's policies were combined with the different demands of the people from all walks of life, greatly facilitating the future work.

　　Two hundred and forty-seven representatives attended the meeting (including thirty women). On the first day of the conference, Bian Shoujian, Secretary-General of the Preparatory Committee, first reported on the preparations for the conference, followed by Wang Qingyun, Chairman of the Conference, who reported on the significance of the meeting. Then, Lin Tie, Secretary of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, was invited to speak. Lin Tie emphatically explained the propositions of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the CPC on the new agricultural tax and the development of production. At the meeting, County Head Liu Yun reported on the county's production summary, the winter production plan, and the draft plans for agricultural and industrial-commercial taxes. In the group meetings that evening, the discussions were not enthusiastic because they failed to first concentrate on the levy issue that most representatives were concerned about, and the division of groups did not pay attention to the different requirements of all circles. On the second day, the groups were reorganized according to the different requirements reflected in the proposals of representatives from all walks of life. In this way, most representatives focused on the discussion of the agricultural tax draft, while the teachers and students group combined to discuss educational issues, and the industrial and commercial circles and doctors group focused on discussing industrial-commercial tax and medical health issues.

　　The group discussion meeting was a very important link in the entire representative conference, and it was very successful. Those with complete opinions were allowed to speak after those with fragmented opinions, those who liked to speak were allowed to speak after those who did not like to speak, and men were allowed to speak after women, so that everyone could speak freely. In the discussion of the levy issue, the first issue that unfolded was whether the burden was heavy or not. Some representatives originally planned to report disasters and request tax reduction or exemption before the meeting; however, after repeated discussions and specific calculations of the burden of Zhangzhuang Village, it was proved that the figures allocated by the government were lower than the representatives had originally expected. Therefore, the representatives believed that the burden was not heavy and that the completion of the levy was not a problem. In such repeated discussions, many representatives pointed out that the village-centrism was wrong. Some representatives raised the issue of deferring the payment of public grain, but most representatives did not agree and criticized: "If everyone defers the levy, what will our millions of troops eat?" "If everyone wants to take less, what will the government use to lend us waterwheels?" Then, everyone turned to the discussion of various specific difficulties in the levy, such as the ending of arrears in public grain, the handling of those who deliberately resisted paying the levy, the reduction and exemption issues for poor families of revolutionary martyrs, families of revolutionary soldiers, and families of revolutionary workers, which were all resolved one by one.

　　The success of the group meeting directly guaranteed the victory of the conference. In the general discussion on the third day, the speeches were universal and compact, with each person speaking for no more than ten minutes, and most for only three to five minutes. At the same time, because of good preparation in advance and concentrated opinions, when voting on the levy, the chairman tried hard to make all the representatives understand before putting it to a vote. The representatives unanimously supported the draft levy plan and the winter production plan in their speeches, guaranteeing the completion of the levy task, and striving to do a good job in this year's winter production to lay the foundation for the great production movement next year. Huang Ziqiang, a farmer representative from Xigou Village, said: "Before the Incident, our village had more than 46 qing of land and 123 livestock, only three large wells, and 18 waterwheels. Now the land has only increased by a few mu, the livestock has increased to 142, the large wells have increased to 22, and the waterwheels have increased to 30. This year alone, the four and a half mu of grain I planted yielded thirteen bags and five dou. It is not a problem for our village to exceed the pre-war production level next year." Su Chengjie, a representative from the business community, said: "The tax policy is fair and reasonable, and it should be guaranteed to be completed on schedule."

　　The main gains of this meeting were the resolution of current practical work issues, the understanding of the current general demands of the people, and the close connection between the government and the broad masses of the people (a total of 479 proposals were put forward by 124 villages before the meeting). The representatives responded: "This meeting was very successful, and communication between the top and bottom was achieved." "Our representatives cannot be selfish, our representatives speak for the village and also speak for the county." The cadres further recognized the role of the representative conference in promoting practical work.

　　把各界代表会开好
  　满城创造新经验
    集中解决群众最关心问题　开好小组会保证大会成功
    【新华社保定二十四日电】河北省满城县各界代表会议，于十一月五日开幕，七日结束。会议在极短的时间内，集中解决了当前群众所迫切要求解决的征收问题，并讨论了政府所提出的冬季生产方案。在各阶层代表的反复讨论中，使政府的政策与各界人民的不同要求相结合，大大便利了今后工作的进行。
    出席会议的有二百四十七位（其中妇女三十人）代表·大会第一日，首由筹委会秘书长边守俭报告大会筹备经过，并由会议主席王庆云报告开会意义，接着邀请中共河北省委会书记林铁讲话。林铁着重地说明了中共河北省委对于新农业税和发展生产的主张。会上刘云县长报告了全县生产总结，冬季生产方案及农业税、工商税征收草案。在当晚的分组会议中，由于未能首先集中多数代表所最关切的征收问题讨论，组的划分上亦未注意照顾各界的不同要求，因此讨论不热烈。第二日重新划组，依据各界代表提案所反映的不同要求分组讨论。这样，多数代表便集中在农业税草案的讨论上，而教员学生组结合讨论教育问题，工商界、医生组着重讨论工商税及医药卫生等问题。
    小组讨论会在整个代表会中是一个极为重要的环节，开得很好，有成套意见的让有零星意见的先说，爱说的让不爱说的先说，男的让女的先说，因此每人都能畅所欲言。在征收问题的讨论中，首先展开的是重不重的问题。有些代表在开会前，原准备报灾，要求减免负担；但经过反复讨论，又具体计算了张庄村的负担，证明政府所分配的数字比代表原来所预料的为低，代表们于是认为负担并不算重，完成征收不成问题。在这样反复讨论中，许多代表指出村本位思想是不对的，有的代表提出缓交公粮的问题，但多数代表们不赞成，并批评说：“都缓征了，叫咱几百万大军吃啥？”“都想少拿，政府使啥给咱贷水车？”接着，大家又转到征收中各种具体困难问题的讨论，如公粮尾欠的结束，对故意抗不缴征者的处理，贫苦的革命烈士家属，革命军人家属和革命工作人员家属的减免问题等，均一一得到解决。
    小组会讨论的成功，直接保证了大会的胜利。在第三天的大会讨论中，发言普遍。而且紧凑，每人不过十分钟，多数只三、五分钟。同时由于事前准备得好，意见集中，在通过征收表决时，主席努力做到使代表全部听懂，而后付表决。代表们的发言都一致拥护征收草案及冬季生产方案，保证完成征收任务，并努力做好今年冬季生产，为明年大生产运动打下基础。西苟村农民代表黄自强说：“俺村事变前有地四十六顷多，牲口一百二十三个，水井大的只三眼，水车十八辆，现在地只增加了几亩，牲口增加到一百四十二个，大井增加到二十二眼，水车增加到三十辆，光今年我种的四亩半谷就打了十三袋零五斗，明年咱村超过战前生产水平不成问题。”商界代表苏成杰说：“税收政策是公平合理的，应该保证按期完成。”
    这次会议的主要收获是解决了当前实际工作的问题，了解了当前人民的普遍要求，密切了政府与广大人民间的联系（会前一百二十四个村共计提出提案四百七十九条）。代表们反应：“这次会开得很好，上下通气了。”“咱们代表不能自私自利，咱代表村里说话，也代表县里说话。”干部们则进一步认识了代表会推动实际工作中的作用。
