    San Francisco Peace and Democracy League sent a telegram to Chairman Mao Zedong on October 19th, the telegram is as follows: To Mr. Mao Zedong, Chairman of the People's Republic of China:

    The People's Government of New China is born, and the Chinese nation has stood up from now on. The great People's Liberation War has liberated the people of the whole country from feudal oppression and from the shackles of imperialism, making our nation rejuvenate from aging and obtain new life. All of this relies on your correct leadership.

    The emergence of New China not only turned over a quarter of humanity, but also brought joy to the entire human race, consolidated the forces of peace, and brought the vision of Great Harmony closer. All of this is also attributed to your wise leadership.

    The newborn motherland has such a vast territory, from Heilongjiang to the Pearl River, from the East China Sea to Tibet, that beautiful mountains and rivers, that fertile land, our future should be so bright and brilliant.

    The three great documents of the "Organic Law of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference," the "Organic Law of the Central People's Government," and the "Common Programme of the CPPCC" have stipulated the blueprint for the emerging China and created the warp and weft of the entire country. We look across the Pacific Ocean and see the torch you are holding high, the red flag with five stars shining. We are willing to accept your call, unite overseas Chinese, seek truth from facts, support and assist the revolution and construction of the motherland, and move forward by leaps and bounds.

    Sincerely,

                                                      Salute to New China!
                                                      San Francisco Peace and Democracy League
                                                                October 19th

    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 21st: The Central and Southern Executive Committee of the Overseas Chinese Democratic Promotion Association in Vietnam sent a telegram to Chairman Mao on October 10th to celebrate the establishment of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China. The original telegram stated: We are in faraway overseas Vietnam, and we are delighted to hear that the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China has been declared to the world on October 1st. Every patriotic overseas Chinese is overjoyed, feeling that we are no longer overseas orphans in the future, but overseas Chinese who have a motherland led by Chairman Mao that truly loves us, and will no longer be discriminated against, bullied and abused. But we always remember Chairman Mao's instructions, not to be proud of this first step of victory. We understand that if imperialism is not completely eliminated one day, our struggle must continue. We are determined to unite all patriotic overseas Chinese and continue to fight against imperialism. At the time of the motherland's rebirth, all our members sincerely congratulate our People's Republic of China for ten thousand years! Long live the Communist Party of China! Long live Chairman Mao!

    【新华社北京二十一日电】旧金山和平民主联盟于十月十九日电毛泽东主席致敬，电文如下：中华人民共和国主席毛泽东先生：
    新中国人民政府诞生了，中华民族从此站立起来。伟大的人民解放战争，把全国人民从封建的压迫下解放出来，从帝国主义的桎梏下解放出来，使我们民族由衰老回复到青春，获得了新生。这一切，都是依靠了你的正确领导。
    新中国的出现，不但使人类四分之一翻了身，而且给整个人类带来了喜悦，使和平势力巩固了，大同远景接近了。这一切，也都归功于你的英明领导。
    新生的祖国，幅员是那么辽阔广大，从黑龙江到珠江，从东海到西藏，那秀丽的山川，那丰饶的土地，我们前途该多么光明灿烂。
    “人民政协组织法”、“中央人民政府组织法”、“政协共同纲领”三大文件，规定了新兴中国的蓝图，制就了整个国家的经纬。我们遥望太平洋彼岸，看见你高举起的火炬，那五星闪耀的红旗。我们愿接受你的号召，团结侨胞，实事求是，拥护和支援祖国的革命和建设，大踏步前进。
    此致
