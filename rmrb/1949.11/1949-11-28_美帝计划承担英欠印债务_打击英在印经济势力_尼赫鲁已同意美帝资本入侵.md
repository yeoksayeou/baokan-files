　　US Imperialism Plans to Assume British Debt to India
  　Striking at British Economic Power in India
    Nehru Has Agreed to US Imperialist Capital Invasion
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 26th] Electone Agency London, 21st: It is learned here that the United States has formally suggested to the British government that the United States assume the entire massive pound debt owed by Britain to India. The condition put forward by the United States is that Britain hand over to the United States a portion of its assets in India equivalent to the total debt. Britain owes India and Pakistan approximately 1.2 billion pounds. Anglo-American negotiations regarding Britain's debt to India began when Bevin visited Washington before the devaluation of the pound. Nehru continued to discuss this issue during his visit to Truman, and negotiations are still ongoing. This suggestion by the United States is clearly a further direct blow to Britain, in accordance with its plan to undermine British economic power in Southeast Asia. It will disintegrate British capital's control over Indian industry, mines, shipping, and railway transportation, and transfer most of them to the more powerful US capital. Britain has now openly admitted that it cannot even repay a portion of its debt. In his negotiations with the American side, Bevin initially suggested that Britain make a certain degree of "economic retreat" from India, Pakistan, and Ceylon, but retain certain special features of British capital there. According to well-informed sources in London, the United States even rejected these concessions and now demands, in addition to directly participating in British industrial and commercial companies in India, the abolition of tariff barriers and certain special "guarantees," such as the profits earned from American investments being convertible and no nationalization being implemented, etc. It is said that Nehru has agreed to the American proposal, vainly attempting to use American capital to counter the growing influence of the victory of the Chinese People's Liberation Movement on the Indian people.

　　美帝计划承担英欠印债务
  　打击英在印经济势力
    尼赫鲁已同意美帝资本入侵
    【新华社北京廿六日电】电通社伦敦二十一日讯：此间获悉：美国已正式向英国政府建议，由美国承担英国欠印度的全部巨额英镑债务。美国提出的条件，是要英国把它在印度的资产中相等于债务总额的一部分交给美国。英国欠印度和巴基斯坦的债务约十二亿英镑。英美关于英国对印债务的谈判，是在英镑贬值之前贝文访华盛顿时开始的。尼赫鲁在访杜鲁门时，曾继续商谈了此一问题，日前，谈判仍在进行中。美国的这一建议，显然的是美国按照其破坏英国在东南亚经济力量的计划，对英国实行进一步的直接打击。它将瓦解英国资本对印度工业、矿藏、海运和铁路运输的掌握，并使它们大部分都归属更强有力的美国资本。英国现已公开承认它甚至不能偿付其债务的一部分。贝文在他与美国方面的谈判中，最初曾建议英国自印度、巴基斯坦和锡兰作某种程度的“经济退却”但保留英国资本在那里的某些特种。据伦敦消息灵通人士称：美国甚至连这些让步都加以拒绝，而现在，却要求除了直接参加在印度的英国工业、商业公司以外，还要求取消关税壁垒和要求某些特别“保证”，例如美国投资所获利润可以兑换、不实行国有化等等。据说，尼赫鲁已同意美国的建议，他妄图利用美国资本来对付中国人民解放运动的胜利对印度人民日增的影响。
