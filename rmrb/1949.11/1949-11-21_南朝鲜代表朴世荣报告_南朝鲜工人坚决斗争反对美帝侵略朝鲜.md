Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 20th: At the fourth day of the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference, Park Se-young, Deputy Chairman of the National Labor Council of South Korea, reported on the trade union activities in South Korea. He first thanked the Executive Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions on behalf of the Korean Labor Council for planning and convening this conference, stating that this conference strengthened the close ties between Asian and Australian workers, and developed the struggle of Asian and Australian people against their common enemy—U.S. and British imperialism. Park Se-young then extended warm congratulations to the Chinese working class and its organization, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, for their victory.

The first part of Park Se-young’s report described the current situation in South Korea. He said that the industry in South Korea has been largely destroyed, and the dependence on U.S. imperialism is deepening, leaving people in hunger. The number of factories and enterprises in South Korea was 10,065 in 1943, but it decreased to more than 4,500 by March 1947, and the recent destruction is even more severe. Even the mouthpiece of the traitor Syngman Rhee himself admitted that in Yeongdeungpo, the most prosperous industrial area in South Korea with more than 200 large and small factories, only a dozen or so can pay wages on time now. Under such circumstances, a large number of workers are unemployed, and their lives are becoming increasingly impoverished.

In 1943, there were a total of 356,927 workers engaged in industry, mining, and transportation, which decreased to 150,530 in 1947. According to the statistics on November 15, 1946, there were a total of 1,101,723 unemployed workers at that time. Today, the number of unemployed and semi-unemployed workers has reached more than 3 million, accounting for one-sixth of the total population of Korea. Even the lives of those who are employed are in an unimaginable situation. Under extremely harsh working conditions, railway workers work more than 80 hours a week; in the "New Han Garment Factory" in Seoul, young female workers work more than 90 hours a week.

The destruction of South Korea's industry, the increase in unemployed workers, and the impoverishment of workers' lives are inseparable from the further aggression of U.S. imperialism.

In 1948, the total amount of U.S. loans to South Korea reached 199 million U.S. dollars. U.S. imperialists organized companies such as the Korean Coal Mine, the Korean Electric Power, the Korean Petroleum, and the Korean Shipping, and took full control of South Korea's power, raw materials, underground resources, transportation and other enterprises.

In the political field, a beast-like fascist dictatorship that has never been seen even under the tyranny of Hitler is now heavily oppressing the people of South Korea. U.S. imperialists and their running dogs, the Syngman Rhee traitorous gang, have turned South Korea into a large slaughterhouse. Since Japan's surrender on August 15, 1945, more than 100,000 Korean patriots have been massacred. The reason for their massacre is simply because they demanded the unification and freedom of their motherland. Recently, the reactionaries have forcibly burned people's houses in the areas where South Korean guerrillas are active, leaving millions homeless, and those who show slight dissatisfaction are executed on the spot.

Under the reactionary's crazy rule, the trade union movement naturally suffered cruel persecution. Many cadres and general members of the National Labor Council have been arrested and shot without reason. After the World Federation of Trade Unions delegation headed by Louis Saillant visited South Korea in July 1947, they exposed this tragic situation, calling it "In the world, except for Greece, there has not been such a situation in any other region." But today's situation is even worse than it was then.

In his report, Park Se-young talked about the struggle of South Korean workers for freedom and liberation. He said: The more severe the enemy's suppression is, the deeper the South Korean workers' hatred for the enemy is. They stand at the forefront of all the people and continue their heroic struggle. In the struggle, the South Korean National Labor Council plays a leading role.

Since 1946, the National Labor Council of South Korea has launched countless movements. These were participated in by millions of people from all walks of life in South Korea, such as the struggle on November 30 last year demanding the withdrawal of U.S. troops, and the general strike on July 20 this year in support of the Fatherland Front's peaceful reunification plan. In these struggles, the workers united around the National Labor Council of South Korea played a vanguard role.

Due to the crazy suppression by U.S. imperialism and the Syngman Rhee traitorous gang in South Korea, the National Labor Council is already in an illegal position and its activities are very difficult. But by October 30, 1948, the number of organized workers in various industries had reached 252,016.

The struggle goal of the National Labor Council of South Korea, which has more than 252,000 members, is first to oppose the U.S. imperialist policy of aggression against Korea, and to overthrow the U.S. imperialist puppet Syngman Rhee government, and to expel the United Nations Korea Commission, which is a tool of U.S. imperialist aggression policy. These struggles are the most basic tasks for the Korean people to unify their motherland.

The National Labor Council of South Korea fully supports the Fatherland United Front, and at the end of June this year, it put forward a peaceful reunification plan to the entire people, and is fighting for its realization and to overthrow the Syngman Rhee traitorous gang.

The National Labor Council of South Korea is constantly fighting to improve workers' lives and to help farmers implement land reform.

The National Labor Council of South Korea promptly exposes all the conspiracies of the Syngman Rhee traitorous gang to split the unity of the Korean workers, and fights to consolidate the unity of the domestic working class. At the same time, the National Labor Council opposes the conspiracy of the Anglo-American imperialists to provoke war by frantically preparing for war, and fights to defend world peace.

Park Se-young then pointed out that U.S. imperialism is now more frantically stepping up its aggression against South Korea, attempting to use Korea as a military base against the Soviet Union and the Asian people. Therefore, the liberation of South Korea is an important issue in the cause of defending Asian peace. Park Se-young finally requested that the World Federation of Trade Unions and the representatives of various countries attending the conference actively care for and call on the people of various countries to support the struggle of the Korean people against the U.S. imperialist policy of aggression, and hoped that the working classes of India, the Philippines, and the Commonwealth of Australia would actively oppose sending representatives from their countries to participate in the United Nations Korea Commission, and help the Korean people smash this tool of U.S. imperialist aggression against Korea.

Park Se-young finally stated: The National Labor Council of South Korea warmly supports the close cooperation of the Asian and Australian working classes. It believes that the establishment of the Asian Liaison Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions has great historical significance in safeguarding Asian peace and security. Encouraged by the victory of the Chinese revolution, the Korean working class, closely united with the Asian working class and the workers of the world, will continue to struggle and will soon achieve the unification and independence of Korea.

　　南朝鲜代表朴世荣报告
　　南朝鲜工人坚决斗争反对美帝侵略朝鲜
    【新华社北京二十日电】在亚洲澳洲工会会议第四天大会上，南朝鲜全国劳动评议会副委员长朴世荣报告南朝鲜的工会活动。他首先代表朝鲜劳动评议会感谢世界工联执行局策划召开这一会议，称述这一会议加强了亚澳工人的紧密联系，并且发展了亚澳人民反对其共同敌人——美英帝国主义的斗争。朴世荣继又向已经获得胜利的中国工人阶级及其组织中华全国总工会表示热烈的祝贺。
    朴世荣报告的第一部分叙述了南朝鲜的现状。他说，南朝鲜的产业大部已被破坏，对美帝国主义的隶属化日益加深人民陷于饥饿。南朝鲜的工厂和企业单位的数目，一九四三年是一万零六十五处，到一九四七年三月已减至四千五百多处，最近的破坏则更加厉害。就是卖国奴李承晚自己的机关报也这样供认，南朝鲜工业最繁荣的、有着大小工业二百余家的永登浦一带，能够按时支付工资的，现在也仅有十几家。在这种情况下，大批工人失业，生活日益贫困。
    一九四三年从事于工矿业运输业的工人，共有三十五万六千九百二十七人，到一九四七年就减到十五万五百三十名。根据一九四六年十一月十五日的统计，当时失业的工人共有一百一十万一千七百二十三人。今天失业和半失业的工人则达到了三百多万，占朝鲜总人口的六分之一。就是在业的工人生活，也是处在不可想象的境地。他们在劳动条件极为恶劣的情况下，铁路工人每周的工时超过八十小时；在汉城的“新汉被服厂”，青年女工每周做工竟超过九十小时。
    南朝鲜这种产业的被破坏，失业工人增多，工人生活的贫困等情形，是和美帝国主义进一步的侵略分不开的。
    一九四八年南朝鲜的美贷输入，总数达一亿九千九百万美元之多，美帝国主义者组织了大韩煤矿、大韩电力、大韩煤油、大韩航运等公司，全盘掌握了南朝鲜的动力、原料、地下资源、交通与运输等企业。
    在政治方面，希特勒暴政下也不曾有过的野兽似的法西斯独裁，今天高压在南朝鲜人民的头上。美帝国主义者及其走狗李承晚卖国匪帮，把南朝鲜变成为一个大屠杀场。自从一九四五年“八一五”日本投降以来，朝鲜爱国人士被屠杀的已经超过十万以上。他们被屠杀的理由只是因为他们要求祖国的统一和自由。最近反动派更在南朝鲜游击队活动地区里，强行焚烧人民的房屋，致使数百万人无家可归，遭难者稍为表示不满，就被当场枪决。
    在反动派这种疯狂的统治下，职工运动自然也遭受残酷迫害。全国劳动评议会干部以及一般会员，无故被逮捕被枪杀的非常多。一九四七年七月以路易·赛扬为首的世界工联代表团访问南朝鲜之后，曾对这种凄惨的情况予以揭露，称之为“在世界上，除了希腊之外，没有一个地区有过这种的情况”。但是今天的情形比当时还要更加恶化。
    朴世荣在报告中说到南朝鲜工人为争取自由解放而斗争的情况。他说：敌人的镇压越是厉害，南朝鲜的工人对敌人的仇恨越深，他们站在全体人民的最前列，继续着英勇的斗争，在斗争当中，南朝鲜全国评议会起着领导的作用。
    自从一九四六年以来，南朝鲜全国劳动评议会先后发动了无数次的运动。这些都南朝鲜各界数百万人民参加的，象去年十一月三十日的要求美军撤退的斗争，今年七月二十日支持祖国阵线的和平统一方案总罢工等。在这些斗争中，团结在南朝鲜全国劳动评议会周围的工人们，起了先锋的作用。
    由于美帝国主义和南朝鲜李承晚卖国匪帮的疯狂镇压，全国劳动评议会已经处于非法地位，活动十分困难。但是到一九四八年十月三十日，组织起来的各业工人，为数已达二十五万二千零十六人。
    拥有二十五万二千多会员的南朝鲜全国劳动评议会，其斗争目标，首先是反对美帝国主义对朝鲜的侵略政策，并且打倒美帝国主义傀儡李承晚政府，驱逐作为美帝侵略政策的工具的联大朝鲜委员会。这些斗争是朝鲜人民统一祖国的最基本任务。
    南朝鲜全国劳动评议会完全拥护祖国统一战线，在今年六月底向全体人民提出和平统一方案，并且为它的实现及打倒李承晚卖国匪帮而斗争。
    南朝鲜全国劳动评议会不断地为改善工人生活进行斗争，并且帮助农民实行土地改革。
    南朝鲜全国劳动评议会及时地暴露李承晚卖国匪帮分裂朝鲜工人团结的一切阴谋，为巩固国内工人阶级的统一而斗争。同时，全国劳动评议会又反对疯狂备战的英美帝国主义挑起战争的阴谋，为保卫世界和平而斗争。
    朴世荣接着指出，美帝国主义现在正更疯狂地加紧对南朝鲜的侵略，企图把朝鲜做为反苏反亚洲人民的军事基地。因此，南朝鲜的解放，是目前保卫亚洲和平事业的重要问题。朴世荣最后要求世界工联及参加大会的各国代表积极关心并且号召各国人民声援朝鲜人民反对美帝侵略政策的斗争，并希望印度、菲律宾、澳大利亚联邦的工人阶级，积极反对派遣本国代表参加联大朝鲜委员会，帮助朝鲜人民粉碎这一美帝国主义侵略朝鲜的工具。
    朴世荣最后表示：南朝鲜劳动评议会热烈支持亚澳工人阶级的紧密合作。它相信世界工联亚洲联络局的创立在保卫亚洲和平和安全上有着巨大的历史意义。朝鲜的工人阶级在中国革命胜利的鼓舞下，与亚洲工人阶级和全世界工人密切地团结起来，继续奋斗，不久将获得朝鲜的统一与独立。
