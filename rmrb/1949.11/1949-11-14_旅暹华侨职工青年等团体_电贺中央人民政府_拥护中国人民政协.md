Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 13th: Overseas Chinese workers, youth, educators, artists, women and other groups in Siam sent telegrams to congratulate the Central People's Government and the People's Political Consultative Conference. The Bangkok Quanmin Daily published the following congratulatory telegram from the All-Siam Federation of Trade Unions (Chinese Workers Department) and the Bangkok Federation of Trade Unions (Chinese Workers Department) to the Beijing Central People's Government Committee on October 1st:

To the Honorable Members of the Beijing Central People's Government Committee:

The founding ceremony of China and the victorious closing of the People's Political Consultative Conference have concluded, and the Central People's Government has formally announced its establishment. We, the overseas Chinese workers in Thailand, firmly believe that the Central People's Government, led by the working class, based on the peasant class, and united with all democratic classes and all ethnic groups in the country, will surely lead the people of the whole country to carry the liberation war through to the end, liberate all of China's territory, complete the great construction in economy, politics, and culture, and establish an independent, democratic, peaceful, unified, and prosperous People's Republic. We, the workers abroad, are delighted to hear the good news and express our heartfelt support. We send this telegram to congratulate you, and on behalf of all Thai-Chinese workers, we pay our respects to the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and to the Central People's Government. We are willing to firmly stand on our working class position, unite all Thai workers to support and implement all resolutions of the Central People's Government, and strive to promote friendship between the Chinese and Thai people.

With the ardent hope of the people of the whole country, you have solemnly convened the unprecedented Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. No words can describe your great achievements! Turning through history, it is difficult to see such great unity of the people. The successful convening of the People's Political Consultative Conference tells us: the imperialist disasters that the Chinese people have endured for a hundred years no longer exist! The reactionary bureaucratic rule that the Chinese people have suffered for nearly twenty years has been completely overthrown! The bright road has suddenly appeared in the hard struggle of the revolutionary people of China under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and all of you. The victory of the motherland has brought boundless encouragement and happiness to overseas Chinese. We – Thai-Chinese teachers, youth, students, women, and the art community – extend our warmest congratulations to all of you! Congratulations to the people of the motherland and to ourselves! From today onwards, we are truly human beings, and the suffering of our overseas Chinese will be eliminated. From today onwards, we resolutely support the people's motherland and the people's government, and we will do our best for the construction of the motherland, the transformation of overseas Chinese communities, and the friendship between the Chinese and Thai people! We wish the
	Conference a successful closing!
	Good health to Chairman Mao and all representatives!
