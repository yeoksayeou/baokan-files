　　Knocking Out the Tiger's Teeth
　　A Record of the Trial and Escort of the "Grain Tigers"
　　At 1:40 AM on November 27th, the Beijing Military Control Commission's Military Law Department, according to the will and demands of the people of the city, punished the unscrupulous merchants who drove up grain prices and hoarded goods. Wang Zhenting, Tian Yuchuan, Tian Bolin, and ten other unscrupulous merchants were brought into the grand courtroom together and lined up. They were terrified and trembled all over, awed by the great power of the people. After two days of overnight interrogation by the Military Law Department of the Military Control Commission, these unscrupulous merchants have been sentenced according to the severity of their cases. Wang Feiran, the head of the Military Law Department, solemnly announced in court: "Wang Zhenting is guilty of hoarding goods, raising prices, cornering materials, refusing to sell after buying, and using bad checks to disrupt economic order and harm the interests of the people. He is sentenced to five years of imprisonment and deprived of his political rights for five years... Tian Yuchuan... is sentenced to four years and six months of imprisonment..." The defendants in military law trials have no right of appeal. These unscrupulous merchants never cared about the lives and deaths of the people when they unscrupulously committed evil deeds before their arrest; now, the people will exercise dictatorship over these elements who disrupt revolutionary order. The criminals truly deserved their punishment. The sentencing lasted forty minutes, and the unscrupulous merchants were returned to the detention center. Before leaving, the "Grain Tiger" Wang Zhenting repeatedly said, "It's over! It's over!" Yes, now that your tiger teeth have been knocked out, you can no longer bite people.

　　Twelve hours later, the ten unscrupulous merchants were brought to the court again. The judgments were served in court. Wang Zhenting and Tian Yuchuan were escorted to the North China First Prison to serve their sentences. Tian Bolin and the other eight were educated in court and ordered to find reliable guarantors and pay their fines before December 5th. The people's government's law is guided by the principle of transformation and education. For criminals with lighter offenses, lenient treatment was given this time, giving them another chance to reform themselves.

　　Yesterday, near the Five Arches of Qianmen, groups of people happily gathered to see the Military Control Commission's public notice of the punishment of Wang Zhenting and Tian Yuchuan. At this time, the truck escorting the Grain Tigers came, and the masses immediately surrounded it. "That fat man is the 'Grain Tiger'!" People pointed and told each other in the crowd, expressing great contempt and hatred. "Down with the Grain Tigers!" A newsboy named Yu Wenxi led a group of newsboys to shout loudly, and the people all over the street immediately responded, forming a chorus. The truck slowly passed through the crowd, and on the road from Zhushikou to Caishikou, it was surrounded by the masses several times. The tricycle workers, who were most affected by the grain price fluctuations, supported the policies of the people's government even more. They excitedly ran after the truck, shouting various slogans of joy and support for the government's judgment. When the truck reached the north entrance of Wansheng Road, more and more people gathered around. Peng Yongfu (pharmaceutical industry), who lived at 16 Xiliushu Well, pointed to Wang Zhenting and Tian Yuchuan in front of the truck and said to everyone: "It's all their fault that everyone has to eat expensive grain. Should the government deal with them or not?" "Should!" "Should!" The masses said in unison. At this time, law enforcement officers repeatedly explained to everyone: It's getting late, now we will send them to prison to reform them, educate them, and give them another chance to reform themselves. The masses slowly made way, and the truck drove out of the crowd. When the truck arrived at Caishikou, which is very close to Wang Zhenting's Changshun Flour Mill and Yong Shengde Grain Store, many people recognized the "Grain Tiger." At this time, everyone shouted in unison: "Come and see! Look at the 'Grain Tiger,' the big unscrupulous merchant!" People surrounded it tightly. People said one after another: "The day the grain prices went up, his family sold the most expensive grain!" "When the Kuomintang was in power, you could buy your way out of crime with gold bars, but under the people's government, you can no longer play tricks." Wang Zhenting and Tian Yuchuan were escorted to prison amidst the condemnation of thousands of people until after 4 PM. The "Grain Tiger" entered the "cage."

　　敲掉老虎牙
  　记“粮老虎”的审判和起解
    十一月二十七日凌晨一时四十分，北京军管会军法处根据全市人民的意志和要求，惩办哄抬粮价，囤积居奇的奸商。王振廷、田雨川、田柏林等十个奸商一齐被传进大法庭，列成了一排。他们慑于人民的伟大力量，吓得全身发抖。军管会军法处经过两天的漏夜审讯，对这群奸商们已经根据案情轻重，分别定案。军法处长王斐然当庭严肃地宣判：“王振廷囤积居奇，抬高物价，套购物资，抢购拒售，并利用空头支票进行破坏经济秩序，危害人民利益，处有期徒刑五年，褫夺公民权五年……田雨川……处有期徒刑四年六个月……”。受军法审判的案犯没有上诉权。这一撮奸商们在被捕以前肆无忌惮地作恶的时候，从来不管人民的死活；现在，人民对这些破坏革命秩序的分子要实行专政了。罪犯们真是罪有应得。宣判历时四十分钟，奸商们再一次还押看守所。临行时，“粮老虎”王振廷连声说：“完了！完了！”是的，现在敲掉你的虎牙，以后再不能咬人了。
    十二个小时以后，十个奸商又被传到了法庭。当庭送达判决书。王振廷和田雨川押解到华北第一监狱执行徒刑。对田柏林等八人当庭予以教育，令其觅妥殷实铺保，限十二月五日前缴清罚款。人民政府的法律是以改造教育为方针的。对于案情较轻的罪犯，这次都是从轻处理，再一次给予改造自新的机会。
    昨天，前门五牌楼一带，一群群的人高兴地围看军管会军法处惩处王振廷、田雨川的布告。这时押解粮老虎的卡车开来了，群众立刻围了上来。“那个胖子就是‘粮老虎’！”人群里互相指点，互相告诉，表示了极大的鄙视与痛恨。“打倒粮老虎！”一个叫于文喜的小报童领导一群报童高声喊起来了，全街上的人立刻响应，汇成一片。卡车徐徐通过人群，在珠市口到菜市口的路上，又几次被群众围住了。受粮价波动影响最大的三轮车工人更是拥护人民政府的政策，他们兴奋地跟着卡车跑，嘴里喊着各种高兴的、拥护政府判决的口号。卡车走到万圣路北口，人们越围越多了。住在西柳树井十六号的彭永福（药行业）在车前指着王振廷、田雨川向大家说：“让大家吃贵粮食，全是他们闹的，政府办他们应该不应该？”“应该！”“应该！”群众七口八舌的说着。这时，执法人员再三向大家解释：时间不早了，现在就送到监狱去改造他们，教育他们，再给他们一次自新的机会。群众慢慢让开一条路，卡车走出了人群。车到菜市口，这里离王振廷的长顺粉厂及永盛德粮店都很近，很多人认识“粮老虎”。这时大家一齐喊：“快来看哪！瞧‘粮老虎’嘿，大奸商啊！”人们又围了个水泄不通。人们纷纷说：“那天粮食涨钱，就属他家卖的粮食贵！”“国民党在的时候你花金条可以买罪，在人民政府这里，你再也不能使鬼了。”王振廷、田雨川在万人唾斥声中，一直到下午四点多钟，被押解到了监狱。“粮老虎”入了“牢笼”。
