　　Anshan Iron and Steel Company's No. 2 Blast Furnace
　　Breaking Through Capitalist Obsolete Experience
　　Moving Towards Soviet Advanced Standards
　　Xiao He
　　Anshan Iron and Steel Company's No. 2 Blast Furnace, starting from September, broke through the highest production record during the puppet Manchukuo era. By November 7th, it had reached over 121% of the highest daily output of the puppet Manchukuo. This is a new technical standard in Chinese metallurgy history, taking China's metallurgical industry a step forward.
　　A blast furnace is a difficult-to-operate behemoth, and the production process is very complex. Many factors affect output, such as the quality of coke, the composition of ore, the temperature of the hot blast during operation, and the amount of air. Even the slightest abnormality can affect the output and quality of the blast furnace; even excessive moisture in the air on rainy days, which increases steam in the hot blast, can reduce output.
　　After liberation, Anshan Iron and Steel faced many difficulties in restoring and developing production. This was reflected not only in the fact that the machinery was too old - blowers and hot blast stoves were too old to be used as desired, equipment was incomplete - the ore dressing plant had not yet been repaired, the iron content of the ore was only 49 to 53 percent, and the operating skills of the workers were unskilled and lacked experience (during the puppet Manchukuo period, the most important parts of the blast furnace - the control room, the winding room, the clay gun, etc. - were all operated by the Japanese), but more importantly, there were stubborn conservative views in the minds of the workers, which directly hindered the creation of new production records.
　　When the No. 2 blast furnace was completed and put into operation, veteran engineers who had worked at Anshan Iron and Steel for more than 20 years believed, based on experience and statistics, that the daily output of the furnace would not easily exceed 300 tons in the first three months of operation, and that maintaining a daily output of 300 to 330 tons would be normal. They firmly believed that their operation was the best production method, and that it was absolutely impossible to break the production record of the puppet Manchukuo era. Under the influence and constraints of their thinking, the workers also lacked confidence in creating new production records.
　　In order to ensure that production is rapidly advanced, it is necessary to overcome conservative views in production and break the constraints of capitalist old production experience. The leadership began to personally go to the factory to investigate, study the capacity of the machinery and equipment, consult with veteran workers, and learn from engineers and experts, and compare it with the advanced production experience of the Soviet Union. Thus, the contradictions and backwardness of capitalist production methods were discovered:
　　From the perspective of volume utilization coefficient, the average utilization coefficient of the past nine blast furnaces in Japan was 1.5, that is, every 1.5 cubic meters of blast furnace volume could produce one ton of iron. (The No. 2 blast furnace is 1.72) But in the Soviet Union, it is 0.82 to 0.85. These two numbers differ greatly. That is to say, using the same volume (for example, a 600 cubic meter blast furnace), the Soviet Union can produce 731.8 tons of iron per day, while Japan could only produce 400 tons during the Japanese era.
　　From the perspective of machine capacity, the winder can feed once every twelve minutes, with a daily capacity of 120 times. To protect the machine from overheating, it can be fed at least 100 to 110 times. However, the average during the Japanese era was less than 80 times, and the maximum was 83 times. Each material can holds about 11 to 12 tons of ore. Assuming the average iron content is 50 percent, each less feed is equal to 5.5 to 6 tons less iron produced.
　　From the perspective of operation, the temperature of the hot blast was only maintained at 500 to 600 degrees during the Japanese period, while the Soviet Union was 850 degrees. The temperature of the hot blast, plus a certain amount of air, determines the speed of ore smelting.
　　From the above facts, it is sufficient to prove that the past operation methods were very backward, so the production record at that time would not be the highest output. The leadership seized this key point, carried out extensive publicity and education among the workers, used vivid facts and iron-like scientific calculations to break the ideological obstacles in production, and further relied on the working class, united technical personnel, and mobilized engineers and technicians to teach workers technology, so that workers also began to work on the winders and clay guns. Due to the enthusiastic operation and active production of the workers, the production situation of the blast furnace became more and more normal. And under the encouragement of boldly creating and promoting rationalization proposals, many technical difficulties were solved, production methods were improved, and the efficiency of machine utilization was improved. For example, the number of feeds per day of the winder has increased from the highest 83 times during the Japanese era to 96 times, the temperature of the hot blast has increased from 5600 degrees maintained during the Japanese era to 720 degrees, and the diameter of the tuyere has increased from 150 mm to 180 mm, which increases the air volume and makes the combustion area uniform. Due to the use of methods of loading more materials and accelerating ore smelting, the difficulty of the iron content of the ore being less than that of the Japanese period (the past iron content was 55 to 58 percent) was also overcome.
　　The development speed of the production achievements of the No. 2 blast furnace is amazing. Starting from September, it has broken through the highest daily output of the puppet Manchukuo era, and the average daily output has also exceeded the production level of the puppet Manchukuo. From the perspective of production efficiency, our volume utilization coefficient has dropped to 0.98 at its highest. From the perspective of quality: the proportion of our iron for steelmaking was over 63% in August, over 74% in September, and over 88% in October; while during the puppet Manchukuo period, the proportion of iron used from 1939 to 1941 was only 14%, and from 1941 to 1945 it only accounted for 33%. Comparing the silicon content, the Japanese period was 2.5, and we have reduced it to below 1.8, and the best silicon content of pig iron for steelmaking is only 0.87. In order to reward the Anshan Iron and Steel workers for their selfless labor and creation, the government has already issued a bonus of 300 million (Northeast currency) yuan and two silk banners to the Anshan Iron and Steel Ironmaking Plant workers. Encourage them to make persistent efforts to create new production records.
　　At present, there are still shortcomings in the blast furnace, such as the coke ratio should continue to be reduced, the loss of gas ash is very large, the capacity of the winder has not been fully utilized, the damage rate of the tuyere is still too high, and the time for replacing the tuyere has not yet reached the standard of twelve minutes, and the volume utilization coefficient has not yet been reduced to 0.82 or 0.85.
　　However, after breaking the conservative views, the production enthusiasm of the workers has flourished. They are working hard, with the confidence of victory, to continue to improve output and quality, and to catch up with the most advanced international standards.

　　鞍山钢铁公司第二高炉
    突破资本主义陈旧经验
  　向苏联先进标准迈进
    孝鹤
    鞍山钢铁公司第二高炉，从九月份开始突破了伪满时代生产的最高纪录，到十一月七日已达伪满最高日产量的百分之一百二十一强。这是中国冶金史上的新的技术标准，使中国的冶金事业向前踏进了一步。
    高炉是个很难操作的庞然大物，生产过程非常复杂，影响产量的因素很多。例如焦炭的质量、矿石的成份、操作上热风温度的高低、风量的大小等，稍失正常都会影响高炉的产量与质量；甚至连雨天时空气中水分过多，热风中增加了蒸汽，也会使产量减少。
    解放后，鞍钢恢复和发展生产中的困难是很多的，这不仅表现在：机器太老——鼓风机、热风炉因为陈旧已不能随心如意地使用，设备不完全——选矿厂还没修复，矿石含铁量仅达百分之四十九至五十三，职工操作技术的水平不熟练、缺少经验（伪满时期高炉最主要的部分—指挥室、卷扬室、黏土炮等全由日人操作）等等，更重要的却是职工思想上存在着顽强的保守观点，它直接阻碍着生产新纪录的创造。
    当第二高炉修竣开工的时候，在鞍钢工作二十多年的老工程师根据经验和统计数字，认为该炉在开工头三个月中，日产量是不易超过三百吨的，能够维持日产三百到三百三十吨就是正常状态。他们坚信自己的操作是最好的生产方法，目前绝不可能突破伪满时代的生产纪录。在他们的思想影响和束缚下，职工们对创造生产新纪录也缺乏信心。
    为了保证生产迅速推向前进，必须战胜生产中的保守观点，必须打破资本主义旧生产经验的约束。领导上开始亲自下厂调查，研究机器设备的能力，向老工友请教，向工程师和专家学习，并且与苏联先进生产经验做比较。于是发现了资本主义生产方法中的矛盾和落后性：
    从容积利用系数来看，日本过去九个高炉平均利用系数是一点五，即高炉容积每一点五立方米可出一吨铁。（第二高炉为一点七二）但是在苏联却是点八二到点八五。这两个数字相差很大。那就是说，用同样容积（譬如六百立方米的高炉）在苏联能日产铁七三一点八吨，而日本时代仅能产四○○吨。
    再从机器能力来看，卷扬机每十二分钟可以上一次料，每天能力为一百二十次。为了保护机器不使发热，最少可以上一百至一百一十次。但是日本时代平均在八十次以下，最多为八十三次。每次料罐所装矿石约十一至十二吨，含铁量平均按百分之五十算，每少上一罐料，即等于少出五点五至六吨铁。
    从操作上看，热风的温度在日本时期仅保持五百至六百度，苏联则为八百五十度，热风温度的高低，加上一定的风量，决定着矿石熔炼的速度。
    从以上的事实，已足可证明过去的操作方法非常落后，因此，那时的生产纪录也不会是最高产量。领导上抓住这个关键，在职工中广泛的进行宣传教育，用生动的事实和铁一样的科学计算，打破了生产中的思想障碍，并进一步依靠工人阶级，团结技术人员，发动工程师和技术员教给工人技术，使工人也开始在卷扬机和黏土炮上工作起来。由于职工热情操作，积极生产，使高炉的生产状况日趋正常。并在大胆创造，推广合理化建议的鼓励下，解决了不少技术上的困难，改进了生产方法，提高了机器利用效能。譬如卷扬机每日上料次数，已由日本时代最高八十三次增为九十六次，热风温度已由日本时代保持五六百度增为七百二十度，风口直径由一五○糎增至一八○糎，使风量增大，燃烧面积均匀。由于使用了多装料和加速矿石熔炼的办法，也克服了矿石含铁量少于日本时期的困难（过去含铁量为百分之五五到五八）。
    第二高炉生产成绩的发展速度是惊人的，从九月份开始，即已突破了伪满时代的最高日产量，平均日产量也超过了伪满的生产水平。从生产效率来看，我们的容积利用系数最高时曾降到点九八。从质量上来看：我们制钢用铁的比例在八月份是百分之六十三强，九月份是百分之七十四强，十月份是百分之八十八强；而在伪满时期，一九三九到一九四一年用铁比例仅为百分之十四，一九四一年至一九四五年仅占百分之三十三。拿含矽量来比较，日本时期是二点五，我们已降到一点八以下，而最好的炼钢用生铁含矽量仅为零点八七。为了奖励鞍钢职工忘我的劳动和创造，政府已经发给鞍钢炼铁厂职工三亿（东北币）元的奖金，和两面锦旗。鼓励他们为创造生产新纪录再接再厉。
    目前高炉还存在着缺点，如焦炭比例还应该继续降低，瓦斯灰损失很大，卷扬机能力还没有充分发挥，风口的毁损率也仍嫌高，换一次风口的时间还没做到十二分钟的标准，容积利用系数还没有降到零点八二或零点八五。
    但是职工们在打破保守观点后，生产热情蓬勃发展起来，他们正艰苦奋斗，抱着胜利的信心，要把产量和质量继续提高，要赶上最先进的国际标准。
