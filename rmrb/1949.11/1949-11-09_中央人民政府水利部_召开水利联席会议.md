Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 8th. The Ministry of Water Resources of the Central People's Government convened a joint meeting of water conservancy from various liberated areas. The meeting opened in Beijing today, with more than 70 water conservancy workers, experts, and professors from various liberated areas attending. Fu Zuoyi, Minister of Water Resources, pointed out in his opening speech that the tasks of this meeting are threefold: first, to understand the situation in various regions and propose a guideline and tasks for water conservancy construction in the near future; second, to formulate a water conservancy work plan for 1950 based on the needs of the people in various regions and the country's current economic strength; and third, to reach a consensus on the issue of unified leadership of national water conservancy work at this meeting.
　　Subsequently, Bo Yibo, Deputy Director of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government, spoke. Deputy Director Bo mainly explained two issues in his speech: one is the hope to start work immediately, combining the urgent problems to be solved currently with the fundamental problems of water management for the long term; the other is the hope that when drafting the water management plan, the current financial difficulties of the country should be taken into account, and attention should be paid to the fact that we still need to devote great efforts to support the front lines. That is to say, the principle of the water conservancy plan should be necessity and possibility, neither ignoring urgent problems nor undertaking everything at once. Finally, Deputy Director Bo encouraged everyone to unite and work hard for the great cause of economic construction of the New China. Shi Jia Yang, Dean of the Engineering College of Tsinghua University, Chang Xihou, Director of the Water Conservancy Department of Peiyang University, Zhao Jinsheng, Dean of Hebei Institute of Technology, and Liu Chongguang, Director of the East China Water Conservancy Committee, also spoke at the meeting today.

　　中央人民政府水利部
  　召开水利联席会议
    【新华社北京八日电】中央人民政府水利部召开各解放区水利联席会议。会议于今日在京开幕，到各解放区水利工作者和专家教授等七十余人。水利部部长傅作义在开幕词中指出：此次会议的任务有三，第一是了解各地情况，提出一个最近期间水利建设的方针与任务。第二是根据各地区人民的需要与全国现在的经济力量，制订一九五○年度的水利工作计划。第三是关于统一全国水利工作的领导问题，要在这次会议上得出一个一致的意见。
    继由中央人民政府财政经济委员会副主任薄一波讲话。薄副主任在讲话中主要解释了两个问题：一个是希望立即开始工作，把当前任务迫切要解决的问题和长远任务治水的根本问题结合起来。一个是希望在拟订治水计划时要估计到国家当前财政的困难，要注意到目前我们还必需付出大的力量以支援前线，这就是说水利计划的原则应该是必需与可能，既不是对紧急问题坐视不理，也不是百废俱举。最后薄副主任勉励大家团结一致，为新中国经济建设的伟大事业而努力。今日在会上讲话的还有清华大学工学院院长施嘉炀、北洋大学水利系主任常锡厚、河北工学院院长赵今声、华东水利委员会主任刘宠光。会议最后选出下列十三人为此项会议的主席团：傅作义、李葆华、邢肇棠、刘宠光、徐觉非、魏兆麟、王化云、丁仲文、徐正、成润、张含英、须恺、郝执斋。
