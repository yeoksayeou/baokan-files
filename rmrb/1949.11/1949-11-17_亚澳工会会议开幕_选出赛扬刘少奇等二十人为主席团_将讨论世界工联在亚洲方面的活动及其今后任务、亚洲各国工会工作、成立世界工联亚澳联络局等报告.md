A total of 117 trade union representatives from China, the Soviet Union, Mongolia, Korea (South and North), India, Vietnam, Burma, Siam, Indonesia, Ceylon, the Philippines, Malaya, Iran, and other countries are participating in the conference. Representatives from Japan, Australia, and New Guinea have not yet arrived. The conference is scheduled to last for a week. The delegates will hear and discuss reports on the WFTU's activities in Asia and its future tasks, reports on trade union work in Asian countries, and reports on the establishment of the WFTU Asian-Australian Liaison Bureau, and will make resolutions.

　　At 3:00 p.m., Louis Saillant announced that all units participating in the conference had arrived, and the conference officially opened. Liu Ningyi, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, on behalf of the preparatory committee, proposed a list of the presidium of the conference, which was unanimously approved. The presidium includes WFTU Executive Bureau members Saillant, Liu Shaoqi, Solovyov, Toledano, Subkaca, Brocksal, Lellrip, Pinya, Abdullah, and national representatives Chen Yun, Adli Bish, Liu Defu, Li Lisan, Wickramasinghe, Zhu Xuefan, Bessianov, Cui ＠de, Liu Ningyi, Sherfanka, Marjou, and twenty others, and Liu Shaoqi was elected chairman of the first meeting.

Saillant said: At this conference, Asian and Australian workers will demand their rights and a happy life. We solemnly declare: The people of Asia and Australia will achieve their sovereign independence, and we must further declare that all workers in Asia and Australia must freely organize their own trade unions. He said: The year 1950 is exactly the halfway point of the twentieth century. In the second half of the twentieth century, we will see the final elimination of imperialist colonial policies in Asia and Australia. The great achievements of the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle in the first half of the twentieth century show the prospects for the revolutionary struggles of the people of Asia and Australia in the second half of the twentieth century.

Finally, the conference adopted the agenda proposed by Executive Chairman Liu Shaoqi on behalf of the presidium. It includes: (1) Report on the WFTU's activities in Asia and its future tasks; (2) Reports from trade unions in Asian countries; (3) Report on the establishment of the WFTU Asian-Australian Liaison Bureau.
