　　Pan Linggao Delivers Closing Remarks
    [Beijing News] Pan Linggao delivered a closing speech at the Second Session of the People's Representative Conference of All Circles in Beijing, which reads as follows: Chairman, fellow representatives, esteemed guests:
    The Second Session of the People's Representative Conference of All Circles in Beijing is now coming to a close. This meeting has been very good and very successful. Before the closing of the conference, I would like to share my feelings about participating in the meeting with you all.
    I am over eighty years old this year. I was originally an old bureaucrat from the feudal era. According to my background, I should say that the feudal system was good. But now I want to say that the new democracy is good, the new democracy is a thousand times better than the feudal system (loud applause throughout the hall). Why do I say that the feudal system is not good? Where is it bad? It is that in the feudal era, the common people could not speak, and they were not allowed to speak even when suffering and being oppressed. Now, under the new democracy, the common people can not only speak, but also what they say should be done, can be done. This is where the new democracy is a thousand times better than feudalism. Although I am an old bureaucrat from the feudal era, I, this old bureaucrat, understand the evils of the feudal bureaucrats and truly know that feudalism is not good.
    I am now participating in this People's Representative Conference, and I have been attending meetings for three days. Although I am old, I still attend every day. Because this conference is a place for the common people to speak, a place for the representatives of the common people to speak, I should come and participate. During these three days of the conference, my feeling is that we have truly reached the Great Harmony, the Age of Great Peace. We have elected the mayor, deputy mayors, and members of the municipal government. We have heard Mayor Nie's government work report, which is a faithful execution of the resolutions of the previous conference. We have discussed the government's tax proposals and made many resolutions to develop production and improve culture. Among these major achievements, what excites and moves people the most, I think, are two major events: The first is that Chairman Mao is concerned about the suffering of the people of Beijing, instructing the government to plan for grain and prepare sufficient supplies, and to open retail stores so that ordinary poor people can buy grain and coal. The municipal government also immediately followed suit. This is truly the greatest good deed, done at the behest of Chairman Mao. We should all unite as one and work hard, so as not to fail Chairman Mao's patriotic and people-loving efforts (loud applause throughout the hall), and to be worthy of Chairman Mao (loud applause throughout the hall). The second good deed is the closure of the brothels in Beijing, which is a great act of charity. I had done this when I was in Gansu, but I couldn't do it well. Now, after our representative conference has passed it, the Beijing Municipal People's Government immediately did it, and immediately did it well. This is the benefit of the new democracy, this is the benefit of the new democracy being a thousand times better than the feudal system, and it is also the benefit of the People's Government truly serving the people and faithfully serving the people (loud applause throughout the hall).
    The mayor, deputy mayors, and members of the municipal government are now elected by ourselves. We can elect the government, we, the common people, can speak here, and what we say should be done can be done. We, the common people, can elect a government to serve us, this is the goal that the Chinese people have been striving for, sacrificing, and shedding blood for more than a hundred years. This goal was not achieved in the Xinhai Revolution, not achieved in the Northern Expedition, not achieved in the Anti-Japanese War, and now it has been achieved (loud applause throughout the hall)! Since the Qing Dynasty, we have been demanding the implementation of democratic constitutionalism, but we could not achieve it. Yuan Shikai and Chiang Kai-shek came, but we still could not achieve it. We, the common people, demanded democracy from them, but they either delayed or deceived us, and always refused to give us democracy. Now we, the common people, have turned over, used our own strength to overthrow the reactionaries, and realized democracy. All this is thanks to Chairman Mao's leadership. In thousands of years, who has been as patriotic and selfless as Chairman Mao? Which ruler in power has not been for his own family and dynasty? Only Chairman Mao is so patriotic and people-loving, and regards the world as his own (loud applause throughout the hall). We must all unite as one and work hard, so as not to fail Chairman Mao's efforts, and to be worthy of our Chairman Mao (loud applause throughout the hall)!

　　潘龄皋致闭幕词
    【北京讯】潘龄皋在北京市第二届各界人民代表会议致闭幕词，文如下：主席、各位代表、各位来宾：
    北京市第二届各界人民代表会议，现在就要闭幕了。这个会开得很好，很成功，我要趁大会闭幕以前，把我参加会议的感想向诸位报告报告。
    我今年八十多岁了，我本来是封建时代的旧官僚，照我的出身，我应该说封建制度好。可是我现在要说新民主好，新民主比封建制度好过千万倍（全场大鼓掌）。我为什么说封建制度不好？不好在那里呢？就是封建时代老百姓都不能说话，受苦受压迫也不许说话。现在老百姓在新民主主义之下，不仅可以说话，而且说要怎么办，就能怎么办。这就是新民主比封建好过千万倍的地方。我虽是封建时代的旧官僚，可是我这个旧官僚才懂得封建官僚的坏处，才真正知道封建主义不好。
    我现在参加了这个人民代表会议，开了三天会了，虽然年龄大了，可是我仍然天天到会。因为这个会是老百姓说话的地方，是老百姓的代表们说话的地方，我应当来参加。在这三天大会中，我的感想是我们真正到了大同盛世，我们选举了市长、副市长和市政府委员，我们听到了聂市长的政府工作报告，这个报告是忠实执行上次会议的决议情形，我们讨论了政府的税收提案，也作出了许多发展生产，提高文化的决议。在这些重大的成就当中，最使人兴奋感动的，我觉得有两件大事：第一件是毛主席关心我们北京人民的生活痛苦，指示政府筹划粮食，准备充分的供给，并且开办零售店，让一般穷苦老百姓能买到粮食和煤。市政府也立刻照办了。这件事真是最大的好事，是毛主席叫我们作的。我们应当大家团结一心努力工作，才不辜负毛主席的爱国爱民的苦心（全场大鼓掌），才对得起毛主席（全场大鼓掌），第二件好事是封闭北京的妓院，这是一件大善事。封闭妓院这件事，我过去在甘肃任内是作过的，可是作不到，办不好，现在经过我们代表会一通过，北京市人民政府马上就办了，马上就办好了，这就是新民主的好处，这就是新民主比封建制度好过千万倍的好处，也是人民政府真正替老百姓办事，为老百姓忠实服务的好处（全场大鼓掌）。
    市政府的市长、副市长、市政府委员会的委员，现在是我们自己选出来的，我们能够选举政府，我们老百姓能够在这里说话，说要怎么办就怎么办，我们老百姓能够选出政府来，替我们自己办事，这是我们中国老百姓一百多年来就奋斗牺牲流血所要争取的目标，这个目标在辛亥革命没有达到，在北伐战争没有达到，在抗日战争也没有达到，现在达到了（全场大鼓掌）！从满清时代起，我们就要求实行民主宪政，可是达不到，袁世凯、蒋介石来了，还是达不到，我们老百姓要求他们民主，他们不是拖延就是欺骗，总是不给民主，现在我们老百姓翻身了，用我们自己的力量打倒了反动派，实现了民主了，这都是毛主席领导我们成功的。几千年来有那一个人能象毛主席一样的爱国无私？有那一个当朝执政的不是为自己的家天下？只有毛主席才这样爱国爱民、天下为公（全场大鼓掌）。我们大家要团结一心，努力工作，才不辜负毛主席这种苦心，才对得起我们的毛主席（全场大鼓掌）！
