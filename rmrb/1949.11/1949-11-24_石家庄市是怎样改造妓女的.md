　　How Shijiazhuang Transformed Prostitutes
　　Yang Chongye
    The Beijing Municipal People's Government is currently addressing the issue of prostitutes. Here, I will introduce the process and experiences of Shijiazhuang City in handling the prostitute issue.

    After the liberation of Shijiazhuang City in November of the year before last, the municipal government immediately began to address this issue. After a period of investigation and deliberation, the municipal government issued a proclamation on January 4th of last year, closing the brothels and stipulating the methods for dealing with the prostitutes. After the proclamation, a total of 150 people were registered, including 72 prostitutes. According to the statistics from the registration forms, the reasons for becoming prostitutes were: 38 were forced by poverty, 12 fell into the trap due to famine and escaping disasters, 19 were abducted, 2 were captured and raped by Japanese invaders and then sold to brothels, and 1 was forcibly married by a Kuomintang military officer and then sold to a brothel.

    After registration, the owners, pimps, and staff were dealt with separately, either sent back to their hometowns or released on bail. Only two owners with more serious offenses (one of whom had sold nine girls and abused one to death) were handed over to the People's Court by the government. All registered prostitutes were concentrated in the reformatory, where the government specifically assigned personnel to be responsible for education and reform work. Some prostitutes were poisoned by the propaganda of reactionaries and were unwilling to enter the reformatory.

    The government was very cautious in handling this matter and pointed out three points to the cadres responsible for this work: "Serious sympathy, earnest responsibility, and patient education."

    After the prostitutes were received into the reformatory, the institution provided them with good rooms to live in, and they could freely form groups, with several close sisters living together. Initially, the institution did not impose strict controls on them, but female cadres conducted individual talks with them. After a few days, they began to live an organized life, attending classes for two hours every morning. The rest of the time was spent doing odd jobs of production, such as making padded cloth, twisting hemp rope, and doing needlework. After dinner, there were one or two hours of games, learning to sing, holding discussions, and freely participating in the institution's children's group to perform the Yangko dance.

    The preliminary education work was to cultivate their self-esteem, to make them realize that their past lives had been insulted and damaged, to uncover their "scars," and to make them aware of the pain in their spirits. After this step of work achieved results, a grievance meeting was held. Initially, they did not admit that they had any pain, and even thought that the boss was "not bad" to them, and fabricated a set of stories to lie. But slowly, they poured out their grievances like pouring out bitter water, and all the prostitutes cried bitterly. They said: how the bosses and madams bit them with their teeth, beat them with iron rods, and burned them with red-hot tongs; how they were forced to receive customers when they were only fourteen or fifteen years old; and how the嫖客 abused them, etc.

    When they first entered the institution, because they were allowed to freely meet with relatives and friends, some of the old bosses, madams, and rogue嫖客 would come to seduce them from time to time, giving them money and cigarettes. Two of them with weak wills were fooled and secretly ran away. The institution believed that it was difficult to achieve the effect of education without breaking their old, evil relationships in the old society. They enlightened them: "Why are the bosses still good to you? Why are those rogue嫖客 still giving you things? Isn't it just to deceive you? To insult you?" Those who did not accept the things given by these people were especially praised by the institution.

    While conducting education, they were also taught production skills, so that they could become working women after leaving the institution. This process of transformation was quite difficult and required great sympathy and patience to work. The cadres were so concerned about them, asking about their hunger and cold, and did not treat them as outsiders at all. When working, the cadres took the lead in doing it, and when they were sick, the cadres tried to treat them. The institution did not let go of any practical educational opportunities, and also led them to collectively watch plays such as "Wang Xiuluan" and "Great Revenge," which deeply moved them.

    The issue of venereal disease once troubled the institution, because, due to limited funding, it was impossible to completely cure it. After they entered the institution, after examination, all but three young girls of the seventy-two prostitutes had venereal disease, some of which were mild. However, due to preliminary treatment and recuperation, the disease had stopped developing. The institution had to be responsible for curing their venereal disease before they were allowed to leave the institution and get married. The first batch of seventeen people who were discharged from the institution were those who were registered as having families in the city, but according to a subsequent investigation, half of these discharged people ran away with the original bosses or madams. The institution regretted not letting them go before they had been reformed, and they may have fallen into the trap again. The second batch of ten people who were discharged were those who had families in the liberated areas. The institution accepted the experience and handled it cautiously. First, they conducted investigations to understand whether they really had families, and then the institution entrusted someone to send them back to the peasant associations, and the peasant associations had to issue a receipt. The third batch of nine people who were discharged were those who had families in the then-to-be-liberated areas. After a considerable period of investigation by the institution, and after special education work, they were also allowed to go back. The rest of the people later found objects and got married and started families. Marriage had to be introduced by reliable people, and then investigated by the institution. If the institution thought it was appropriate, and she herself agreed, she was allowed to marry. Sometimes the director of the institution would personally go to see the object. These prostitutes (according to the institution's custom, they were called "new women") later had absolute trust in the cadres of the institution. If the institution did not agree, they themselves would not agree. According to an investigation of the first twenty-five married women, their family lives were good. The reporter personally visited their families and found that their general lives were decent. They had basically gotten rid of their frivolous habits, their husbands were good to them, and the relationship between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law was also good. Some people worried that they would not be able to live their lives, but the facts proved that this view was somewhat overstated, because they were able to do the labor work of ordinary housewives. Only two of them had problems after marriage. One was that the institution originally disagreed, because her object was a past "熟客". The institution asked this "object" to go back to his hometown to open a certificate from the peasant association, but he couldn't open it, but the prostitute herself was anxious to get married, and the institution agreed. Not long after the marriage, they quarreled and divorced, and she returned to the reformatory. The other was deceived by the "object" because he had a wife at home. The director regretted not having investigated clearly, and took her back and sued the man in court, punishing him. All the women who were married and discharged regarded the reformatory as their own home, and often returned to the reformatory to visit and see the sisters who remained in the institution. At first, they brought gifts, but the institution resolutely refused to accept them and gave them education, and later they did not bring them. On the anniversaries of "March 8th" and "July 1st", the institution also invited them back to the institution for dinner. They also sent representatives to participate in the city's women's congress. "The old society turned people into ghosts, and the new society turned ghosts into people." This is a concrete example. [Beijing Branch]

　　石家庄市是怎样改造妓女的
　　杨重野
    北京市人民政府正在处理妓女问题，这里我介绍一些石家庄市处置妓女问题的经过和经验。
    石家庄市在前年十一月解放后，市府即着手处理这个问题，经过一个时期的调查酝酿，到去年一月四日由市政府布告封闭妓院，并规定处理的办法。布告后，共登记一百五十人，其中妓女七十二个。根据登记表的统计，流为妓女的原因为生活所迫者三十八人，由于灾荒逃难而陷入火坑的十二人，被拐骗的十九人，被日寇抓来强奸后卖到妓院的二人，被国民党军官强娶过来后卖到妓院的一人。
    登记后对于老板、鸡子、伙计分别处理或是遣送回籍或是取保释放。只有两个情节较重的老板（其中有一个卖过九个姑娘，被他虐待死了一个），由政府交给人民法院处理。登记的妓女，全部集中到教养院，由政府专门派人负责进行教育改造工作。妓女中有的中了反动分子宣传的毒，不愿进教养院。
    政府对处理这件事非常审慎，对负责进行这一工作的干部指出三点：“严肃的同情，认真的负责，耐心的教育”。
    妓女被接到教养院后，由院里把好房间让给她们住，并可以自由结组，几个相好的姊妹可以住在一起。院里起初对她们也没有什么严格的管制，只由一些女干部分别对她们进行谈话，过了几天开始过有组织的生活，每天早上上课两小时，其余的时间是作些零碎生产的活，如打夹布，拧麻绳，做针线等，晚饭后有一两小时游戏，学唱歌，开讨论会，还可以自由参加院内儿童团扭秧歌。
    初步的教育工作是培养她们的自尊心，叫她们认识自己过去的生活是被污辱与被损害的，揭开她们的“伤疤”，叫她们认识在她们精神上的苦痛，这步工作有了成绩后，便举行诉苦大会，起初她们不承认自己有什么痛苦，甚至认为老板对她们“还不错”，并且给自己编造一套故事来说谎，但是慢慢地她们象倒苦水一样统统说出来了，全体妓女都说得痛哭流涕，她们讲：老板、领家的怎样用牙咬，用铁棍子打，用烧红的火钳子烫，十四、五岁便逼着去接客，嫖客怎样虐待她们等等。
    在刚入院的时候，因为允许她们自由的会见亲友，这样一些旧日的老板、领家的和一些流氓的嫖客便不时地来勾引她们，给她们送钱，送香烟，其中有两个意志薄弱的上了当，偷偷地跑掉了，院里认为不把她们旧社会恶劣的关系割断是难以收到教育的效果的。就启发她们：“老板为什么还对你们好？那些流氓的嫖客为什么还给你们送东西？还不是想欺骗你们？污辱你们？”有的不接受这些人送给的东西，院里特别加以表扬。
    一边进行教育，一边教导她们生产的技能，使她们出院后能成为一个劳动妇女，这个改造过程是相当艰难的，需要很大的同情和耐心的去工作。干部对她们是那样的关切，问饥问寒的全不把她们当成外人，劳动起来干部带头去干，有了疾病干部设法给医治。院里不放过任何实际的教育机会，还领着她们集体地去看过“王秀鸾”、“大报怨仇”等戏，使得她们深深受了感动。
    性病的问题曾使得院方很苦恼，因为限于经费，没法彻底根治。她们入院后经过检查，七十二个妓女中除了三个小女孩子外都有性病，其中有的较轻。但由于初步医治和休养已停止发展，院方必需负责把性病给她们治好了，才准许她们出院结婚。第一批出院的十七人，这些都是根据登记在本市有家的，但据事后调查，这批出院的有一半是跟着原来的老板或是领家的跑了。院里很后悔没有把她们改造好就让她们走了，也许又重新坠入火坑。第二批出院的十个，是有家在解放区的，院里接受经验，处置就审慎了，先是经过调查，了解她们是否真有家，以后由院里委托人送回去交给贫农团，还得由贫农团开回条子来。第三批出院的九人，是有家在当时的待解放区的，经过院里相当时期的考查，并特别进行教育工作后也准许回去了。其余的人后来都找到对象结婚成家了。结婚要经过可靠的人介绍，再由院里进行调查，院里认为合适，她本人也同意了，就准许结婚，有的院长亲自去看对象。这些妓女（按院里习惯独呼是“新妇女”），后来对院里的干部是绝对信任的，如果院里不同意，她们自己也不会同意。据最初结婚的二十五个结婚妇女加以调查，家庭生活都不错。记者曾亲自到她们的家庭作过访问，一般的生活都很过得去，她们基本上已经去掉了浮华的习气，丈夫对她们不错，婆媳间也很合得来。有些人耽心她们不会过日子，事实上证明这种看法是有些过实，因为她们对一般家庭妇女的劳动工作都是作得来的。其中只有两人婚后发生了问题。一个是院里原来不同意的，为的她的对象是过去的“熟客”，院里要求这个“对象”回乡去开贫农团的证明，开不出来，可是妓女本人急着要求结婚，院里答应了。结婚不久又吵翻了闹离婚，她又回到了教养院来。另一个是受了“对象”的欺骗，因他家里有妻子，院长很遗憾没有调查清楚，又把她接了回来，并向法院控告，处罚了那个男的。凡是结婚出院的妇女，都把教养院当成自己的娘家，常回教养院来拜望，并看看留在院里的姊妹们。她们起先还带礼物来，院里坚决的不收并给予教育，以后她们就不带了。“三八”节和“七一”的纪念日，院里还请她们回院来聚餐。她们还派了代表参加了全市妇女大会。“旧社会把人变成鬼，新社会把鬼变成人。”这是具体的例子。【北京分社稿】
