Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 20th -- The Asian and Australasian Trade Union Conference today passed the resolution of the Asian and Australasian Trade Union Conference on the World Federation of Trade Unions' assistance to trade union activities in Asian and Australasian countries. The full text is as follows:

The Asian and Australasian Trade Union Conference unanimously agrees with the World Federation of Trade Unions' actions to defend the trade union rights and socio-economic interests of the working people of Asian and Australasian countries, and the World Federation of Trade Unions' firm support for the oppressed people in these countries.

From its early days, the World Federation of Trade Unions has stood up to defend the vital interests of the working people of Asia and Australasia.

The World Federation of Trade Unions has protested against the persecution of democratic trade unions and their leaders in India, Japan, Iran, Lebanon, Malaya, Burma, Indonesia, South Korea, and other countries, and has insisted in the United Nations Economic and Social Council on taking steps to protect trade union rights and freedoms.

The World Federation of Trade Unions has submitted to the United Nations issues of great importance to the working people of most countries in Asia and Australasia: such as full employment, the fight against unemployment, equal pay for equal work for male and female workers, white and colored workers, adults and child laborers, etc.

The World Federation of Trade Unions unites all progressive trade union forces, opposes predatory colonial wars, opposes imperialism and its running dogs in Indonesia, Vietnam, Burma, and Malaya, and mobilizes the international solidarity of the working people to support the people of these countries in defending their freedom and genuine independence.

The Second World Congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions, held in Milan, Italy in June and July 1949, reaffirmed in its resolution on the report of trade union activities in Asia, Africa, South America, and Australia its commitment to the principles adopted as the basis for the World Federation of Trade Unions' activities in colonial, semi-colonial, and economically backward countries.

These principles call for the termination of the system of colonies, protectorates, and dependencies as areas of economic exploitation, assisting the people in these countries in their efforts to obtain self-determination and achieve complete national independence, requiring trade unions in these countries to eliminate any discrimination based on race, color, nationality, and religion, and to establish labor legislation that guarantees the protection of the interests of the working people, and their effective participation in the formulation and implementation of the economic policies of those countries. The Conference fully agrees with and supports these principles which are based on the urgent demands of the working people in the oppressed countries.

The Conference welcomes the proposal of the World Federation of Trade Unions to establish a liaison bureau between the World Federation of Trade Unions and the trade unions of Asian and Australasian countries. Because this agency can provide regular assistance to those countries, strengthen their ties with the World Federation of Trade Unions, and collect information on the situation in Asia and Australasia for the World Federation of Trade Unions and national trade unions.

The Conference urges the leading bodies of the World Federation of Trade Unions to pay attention to the need to provide greater assistance to the trade unions of Asian and Australasian countries. To this end, the Conference recommends:

	The existing trade unions in various industries in Asian and Australasian countries should be invited to cooperate further with the activities of the trade union internationals (the industrial departments of the World Federation of Trade Unions) organized according to industry.

	Steps should be taken to ensure that various materials of the World Federation of Trade Unions are published in the languages of the people of Asian countries.

	The World Federation of Trade Unions should send fact-finding missions to India, Indonesia, Japan, Iran, and South Korea to investigate the situation of trade unions on the spot. The Conference requests the World Federation of Trade Unions to promote and strengthen actions to secure the release or amnesty of arrested and convicted trade union leaders and members in Asian and Australasian countries.

The Conference further recommends that the following issues be submitted to the United Nations Economic and Social Council, in particular to its Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East, for consideration: restoration of democratic rights, guaranteeing workers and their families a sufficient living wage, abolishing slave labor, repealing anti-labor laws, and ending all discrimination based on race, nationality, gender, and religion in India, Ceylon, Iran, Japan, Indonesia, Burma, Malaya, and South Korea.

The Conference is convinced that the World Federation of Trade Unions and the national trade union federations will continue to promote the unity of the working class and all working people with redoubled efforts in the struggle for peace, freedom, democratic rights of all peoples, and for improving their economic and social status.

　　关于世界工联帮助亚澳各国工会活动决议
　　亚澳工会会议通过
    【新华社北京二十日电】亚澳工会会议今日通过亚洲澳洲工会会议关于世界工联帮助亚澳各国工会活动的决议。全文如下：
    亚洲澳洲工会会议一致赞同世界工联捍卫亚澳各国劳动人民的工会权利及社会经济利益的行动，以及世界工联给予这些国家中被压迫人民的坚定支持。
    世界工联从其存在的初期起，便起来保卫亚澳劳动人民的切身利益。
    世界工联曾抗议印度、日本、伊朗、黎巴嫩、马来亚、缅甸、印尼、南朝鲜及其他各国的民主工会和他们的领袖之被迫害，并在联合国经济社会理事会中坚持要求采取步骤，以保护工会权利和自由。
    世界工联曾向联合国提出对亚澳两洲大多数国家的劳动人民非常重要的问题：例如充分就业，和失业作斗争，男工和女工、白种工人和有色工人、成年人和童工的同工同酬等问题。
    世界工联团结一切进步的工会力量，反对掠夺性的殖民地战争，反对帝国主义及其印尼、越南、缅甸和马来亚各国中的走狗，动员劳动人民的国际团结，来支持这些国家捍卫自己自由和真正独立的人民。
    一九四九年六、七月间在意大利米兰所举行的世界工联第二次代表大会，在关于亚洲、非洲、南美洲及澳洲各国工会活动报告的决议中，曾再度申述它忠于曾被采纳作为世界工联有关殖民地半殖民地及经济落后国家内活动基础的一些原则。
    这些原则要求终止作为经济剥削领域的殖民地、保护国和附属地制度，帮助这些国家内的人民为获得自决权及达到完全的民族独立而作的努力，要求这些国家内的工会去除任何基于种族、肤色、民族和宗教的歧视，确立保证维护劳动人民利益的劳工立法，及他们有效的参加制订和实行各该国的经济政策。会议完全赞同和拥护这些基于被压迫各国劳动人民的迫切要求所规定出来的原则。
    会议欢迎世界工会联合会，建立世界工联和亚澳各国工会间的联络局的提议。因为这个机构可以给那些国家定期的援助，加强他们和世界工联间的联系，并可为世界工联及各国工会搜集有关亚洲澳洲情况的资料。
    会议促使世界工联的各领导机构注意到给亚澳各国工会以更大援助的必要，为此目的，会议建议：
    亚澳各国各产业中现有的工会，应被邀和按产业组成的工会国际（世界工联的产部业）的活动，作更进一步的合作。
    应采取各种步骤，使世界工联的各种资料能以亚洲各国人民的文字出版。
    世界工联应派遣调查团到印度、印尼、日本、伊朗和南朝鲜，就地调查工会的情况。会议要求世界工联推进并加强行动，争取释放或赦免亚澳各国被捕及被判罪的工会领袖及会员。
    会议更建议将下列诸问题提交联合国经济社会理事会，特别要在它的亚洲和远东经济委员会中提出考虑：恢复民主权利，为工人及其家属保证足够生活的工资，废除奴役劳动，取消反劳工法令，停止在印度、锡兰、伊朗、日本、印尼、缅甸、马来亚和南朝鲜的一切基于种族、国籍、性别和宗教的歧视。
    大会确信，世界工联和各国总工会将以加倍的努力在为和平、自由、各族人民的民主权利以及为改善他们的经济和社会地位的斗争中，继续促进工人阶级和全体劳动人民力量的团结。（附图片）
