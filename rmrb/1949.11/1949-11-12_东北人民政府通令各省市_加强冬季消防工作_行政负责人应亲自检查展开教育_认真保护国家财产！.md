    Northeast People's Government Issues Circular to All Provinces and Cities:
    Strengthen Winter Fire Prevention Work
    Administrative Heads Should Personally Inspect and Conduct Education
    Conscientiously Protect State Property!
    [This Newspaper's Report] The Northeast People's Government issued a circular on November 4th to the people's governments of all provinces (cities), as well as the Public Security Bureaus, urging them to seriously value fire prevention work and strengthen urban fire control construction. The original text briefly stated:
    Recently, fires have continuously occurred in factories, warehouses, companies, enterprises, as well as government offices, schools, rural areas, and forests, causing significant losses to state and people's property. Taking incomplete statistics from Shenyang, Harbin, Fushun, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Dalian as an example, military industrial enterprises, government offices, schools, and other departments experienced as many as 89 fires in the three months of August, September, and October. In rural areas, landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries have taken advantage of the autumn harvest season to set fire to grain, a recurring problem. In mountainous and forested areas, in Muling alone, from August 4th to August 14th, a period of two weeks, there were 30 to 40 consecutive fires, a very serious situation. Especially now that winter has arrived, sources of fire have increased, and the climate is dry, making fires more likely to occur. If we do not immediately pay attention, be vigilant, and take preventive measures, it will inevitably cause immeasurable losses to the state and people's wealth and production construction. For this reason, this government has specifically decided:
    1. Administrative heads of all factories, mines, companies, warehouses, government offices, schools, and enterprises must personally take action and first conduct a serious and practical inspection of all winter heating facilities under their jurisdiction, such as stoves, fire walls, heated brick beds, boilers, chimneys, as well as electric stoves, electric heaters, and electrical wires, to determine whether they are sturdy and safe, whether there are any dangers such as fire leaks, tilting, collapses, cracks, contact with flammable objects, or short circuits; and whether the storage of materials such as paper, wood, oils, coal, cotton, gas, gunpowder, and other flammable or explosive chemicals is appropriate and whether there are safety devices. They must immediately conduct a serious and practical inspection and, in conjunction with anti-espionage and anti-theft measures, carry out education among all cadres and employees to ensure that every staff member in the enterprise and government office clearly recognizes that fire prevention, anti-espionage, and factory safety are their regular tasks and responsibilities. They must pay close attention at all times, raise vigilance, and resolutely oppose and correct the erroneous concept of indifference to the property of the motherland and the belief that there are no more enemies.
    Secondly, they must establish and strictly enforce various safety responsibility systems. In particular, important machinery and departments must be assigned dedicated personnel to be responsible for guarding day and night. For improperly built heating facilities, dedicated personnel must be assigned to supervise repairs, and no fire shall be lit until the inspection confirms safety. Items with fire hazards must be stored separately, and must not be stacked with other flammable items or important materials without security equipment. Smoking and playing with fire should be strictly prohibited in all material warehouses and workshops, and those who must light a fire should have dedicated personnel responsible for guarding and protecting it. At the same time, fire prevention organizations must be effectively rectified and fire prevention work strengthened. Those who have already established fire prevention organizations should immediately strengthen leadership and training, clarify responsibilities, and regularly conduct drills. Those who have not yet established fire prevention organizations should quickly establish them based on production conditions. Fire extinguishing equipment such as water buckets, sand, fire extinguishers, and water carts must be regularly inspected to keep them in good condition so that they are not frozen, disorganized, and can be used at any time. All employees must be educated to be familiar with the location and know how to use them to avoid rushing around in an emergency and making mistakes.
    2. All county, district, and village governments should immediately seize the opportunity to educate farmers to raise their fire awareness, protect the autumn harvest grain, organize militia to patrol and guard the threshing grounds at night, and strictly prevent retaliation and sabotage by counter-revolutionary elements.
    3. All local governments must seriously value fire prevention work and strengthen urban fire control construction. Public security organs should immediately focus on winter fire prevention, effectively supervise and inspect the fire prevention facilities and fire prevention work of industrial and mining enterprises, and assist enterprise fire brigades in conducting training and education. They should widely promote fire prevention among citizens, call on the masses to be very careful about fire and organize them to protect fire hydrants and establish voluntary fire brigades, so that in the event of a fire, they can cooperate with specialized fire brigades to quickly extinguish the fire and prevent it from spreading. For fire accidents, the arsonists must be strictly punished and held accountable. Hereafter, if a fire occurs in a factory, warehouse, company, enterprise, government office, or school, resulting in loss of state property, the administrative head of the unit shall be primarily responsible. The public security departments of all provinces, cities, and counties shall, in accordance with the responsibilities entrusted to them by this government's order, promptly investigate and report, without any negligence.

    二、各县、区、村政府应即抓紧时机教育农民提高火灾警惕，保护秋收粮食，组织民兵打更值夜看守场院，严防反革命分子的报复破坏。
    三、各地政府必须认真重视消防工作，加强城市消防建设，公安机关应即抓紧冬季防火，对工矿企业之防火设施与防火工作切实进行督促检查，并帮助企业消防队进行训练教育；对市民应普遍展开宣传，号召群众十分小心注意火灾与组织他们保护消火栓，成立义务消防队，以便发生火警，配合专门消防队迅速扑救，制止蔓延；对发生火灾事故，则必须严格惩办火头，追究责任；嗣后凡工厂、仓库、公司、企业、机关、学校失火而致国家财产遭受损失者，各该单位之行政负责人应首先负责，各省、市、县公安厅局应遵照本府命令之责成，及时追查、检举，勿稍疏虞。
