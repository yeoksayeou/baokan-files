Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 10th. The full text of the declaration passed by the Representative Conference of the China Labor Association, which closed today, is as follows:

The Representative Conference of the China Labor Association was held in Beijing, the people's capital, on November 5, 1949, and lasted for four days. It has successfully completed its mission.

Most of the places with Labor Association organizations have representatives attending this conference, so this conference represents the will of all members of the Labor Association.

At this conference, we summarized the work of the Labor Association over the past fourteen years and passed a resolution to end the Labor Association organization. We believe that at that time, under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, the Labor Association used legal possibilities to organize workers through cultural and welfare work, and the resolute struggle against Japanese imperialism and against Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous dictatorship reflected the demands of the national working class and was in line with the needs of the revolutionary situation at that time.

The China Labor Association insisted on uniting with the workers in the liberated areas, and shattered the Kuomintang reactionaries' conspiracy to split the unity of the working class, so that the national workers' movement was unified and the great unity of the national working class was achieved. The China Labor Association and representatives of workers in the liberated areas jointly attended the World Federation of Trade Unions, opposed the conspiracy of the American and British labor traitors to undermine the unity of the world's workers, and helped the unity of the world's workers' movement, achieving the great unity of the world's workers. This played a role in promoting the anti-Japanese national united front and the national people's liberation struggle.

Historical facts have proved that the Chinese working class can only achieve true liberation under the leadership of its vanguard—the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. It is precisely because the comrades of the Labor Association recognized this truth, and it is precisely because the Labor Association resolutely embarked on the revolutionary road, that after suffering the brutal destruction and oppression of the Kuomintang reactionary government, and even armed robbery, it was not only not subdued by violence, but also further united with the trade unions in the liberated areas to jointly fight against the reactionary rule of American imperialism and its running dog Chiang Kai-shek. After the Sixth National Labor Congress, the Labor Association joined the All-China Federation of Trade Unions as a group member, making the cause of unity of the Chinese working class more solid and laying the foundation for today's organizational unity.

Today, thanks to the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the national people's liberation cause has achieved a basic victory, and the People's Republic of China, led by the Chinese working class, has been consolidated and established. In particular, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions has grown and developed strongly over the past year, and has established a strong and unified leadership for the mass organization of the national working class. Therefore, the purpose that the Labor Association has always held and the historical mission of the Labor Association have been completed.

At present, the great task of economic construction is placed before our Chinese working class. To complete this new task, the working class must organize itself into a unified national industrial trade union according to the industrial system, so as to cooperate with the unified economic plan and develop production. The Labor Association is not an organization according to the industrial system and is no longer suitable for the needs of the current objective situation. Therefore, the end of the Labor Association organization and the participation of Labor Association members in the industrial trade unions and local trade union organizations under the leadership of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions will strengthen the unity of the Chinese working class to complete the great historical task of building a new China. This is directly in line with the greatest interests of the Chinese working class.

The end of the Labor Association organization under this new situation also marks the beginning of a new task for the comrades of the Labor Association to participate in the great construction of the new China, which undoubtedly increases the responsibility of the comrades of the Labor Association. Therefore, in the future, the comrades of the Labor Association must, under the leadership of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and under the banner of Chairman Mao, participate in the work of various trade unions in various places with a humble attitude of learning at any time. At the same time, we hope that the advanced comrades of trade unions in various places will help our learning and progress with the fraternal spirit of love. As for the members and cadres of the Labor Association in the areas to be liberated, they should now be better than ever at contacting the masses, working cautiously, gathering strength, and preparing to welcome the imminent arrival of the People's Liberation Army. Under the leadership of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, we will fight to the end for the cause of unity of the Chinese working class and the great construction of the new China.

Long live the great unity of the Chinese working class!
Long live the People's Republic of China!
Long live the Chinese Communist Party!
Long live Chairman Mao!

    中国劳动协会代表会议宣言
    【新华社北京十日电】今日闭幕的中国劳动协会代表会议通过的宣言全文如下：
    中国劳动协会代表会议，于一九四九年十一月五日在人民的首都——北京召开，会期四天，已经圆满地完成了自己的任务。
    这次会议，绝大部分有劳协组织的地方都有代表出席，所以这次会议是代表了劳协全体会员意志的会议。
    在这次会议上，我们总结了劳协过去十四年的工作，通过了结束劳协组织的决议。我们认为当时劳协在国民党反动统治下，利用合法可能，通过文化福利工作，组织工人，为反对日本帝国主义，反对蒋介石卖国独裁而进行的坚决斗争，是反映了全国工人阶级的要求，适合于当时革命形势的需要的。
    中国劳动协会坚持与解放区工人的联合，粉碎国民党反动派分裂工人阶级团结的阴谋，使全国工人运动统一起来，达到全国工人阶级的大团结。中国劳动协会与解放区工人代表共同出席世界工联，反对美英工贼破坏世界工人团结的阴谋，帮助了全世界工人运动的统一，达到世界工人的大团结。这对于当时抗日民族统一战线和全国人民解放斗争事业是有推动作用的。
    历史的事实证明：中国工人阶级只有在自己的先锋队——中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，才能得到真正的解放。正因为劳协同志认识了这个真理，正因为劳协坚决地走上革命的道路，它在遭受了国民党反动派政府横暴的摧残压迫，甚至武装劫收后，不仅没有为暴力所屈服，而且更进一步与解放区工会统一起来，共同为反对美帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石的反动统治而斗争。在举行了第六次全国劳动大会后，劳协加入了中华全国总工会的组织为团体会员，使中国工人阶级团结事业更加巩固，奠定了今天组织统一的基础。
    今天由于中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导，全国人民解放事业已获得基本胜利，中国工人阶级领导的人民民主专政的中华人民共和国也已巩固建立，特别是中华全国总工会一年来的壮大发展，已树立了全国工人阶级群众组织的坚强的统一的领导。因此，劳协一向所抱的目的、劳协的历史任务已告完成。
    当前摆在我们中国工人阶级面前的是伟大的经济建设任务，工人阶级要完成这个新的任务，必须把自己按产业系统组成全国统一的产业工会，这样才能配合统一的经济计划，发展生产。劳协不是按照产业系统的组织，已不适合于当前客观形势的需要，因此，劳协组织的结束，劳协会员分别参加全国总工会领导下的各产业工会与地方工会组织，正是加强中国工人阶级团结统一的力量，来完成建设新中国的伟大的历史任务，这是直接符合于中国工人阶级的最大利益的。
    在这新的形势之下劳协组织的结束，也标志着劳协同志参加新中国伟大建设的新任务的开始，这无疑地更加重了劳协同志的责任。因此，今后劳协同志要在中华全国总工会的领导下，在毛主席旗帜下，随时抱着虚心学习的态度，参加各地各种工会的工作。同时希望各地工会先进同志，以兄弟的友爱精神，帮助我们的学习和进步。至于待解放区的劳协会员和干部，现在应比以往任何时期更加善于联系群众，谨慎工作，聚集力量，准备迎接人民解放军的即将到来。我们要在中华全国总工会领导下，为中国工人阶级团结统一事业和新中国的伟大建设事业奋斗到底。
    中国工人阶级大团结万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
