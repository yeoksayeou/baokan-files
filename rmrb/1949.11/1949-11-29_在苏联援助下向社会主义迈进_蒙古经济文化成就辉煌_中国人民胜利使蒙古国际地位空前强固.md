　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 28th: TASS reports that Marshal Choibalsan, Prime Minister of the Mongolian People's Republic, in a newly published article in Pravda entitled "The Mongolian People on the Road to Socialism" (an abstract of which was issued yesterday), explained the brilliant achievements in the economic and cultural fields of the Mongolian People's Republic over the past twenty-five years since its founding.
　　With the fraternal and selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, Mongolia has made great achievements in establishing industry. From 1940 to 1949, the total output of state-owned industry increased by 280 percent. Marshal Choibalsan also pointed out a great prospect: to establish livestock breeding cooperatives (of which there are now 121) and develop new agricultural sectors in Mongolia, in order to reorganize the scattered, small-scale livestock economy. Modern motorized transportation has been established in Mongolia, laying the foundation for the development of shipping and constructing approximately 1,000 kilometers of high-quality roads. In the past decade, the total number of vehicles has increased by half. The railway connecting the capital of the Republic, Ulaanbaatar, with the Soviet Union was opened to traffic on the 32nd anniversary of the October Revolution. This railway is of particularly great importance for the further development of Mongolia's economy, culture, and new sectors of the national economy.
　　In terms of cultural development: At present, the Republic has 412 primary schools, 14 specialized schools, a higher education institution established for cadres of the Party and government organs, and a National University. In twenty-five years, the number of students has increased by 126 times. Now, one in ten residents of the Republic is studying in primary or secondary schools, or in higher education institutions. The new alphabet, based on Russian, has been promoted throughout the country, which has helped the Mongolian people accept the progressive socialist culture of the Soviet people. 55.4 percent of the national population can now use the new alphabet. A sign of the gradual development of Mongolian culture is the development of newspapers and periodicals. There are now eight central newspapers, fourteen local newspapers, and fourteen periodicals in the country. Marxist-Leninist classics, world literature, and outstanding works by progressive scientists have all been or are being translated into Mongolian. Young Mongolian scientists are united within the Mongolian Science Committee, which, with the help of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, coordinates and guides scientific research for the development of the entire national economy. In recent years, there has also been significant improvement in the development of medical services. With the help of the Soviet Union, the Republic has established hospitals, medical centers, pharmacies, and maternal and child health clinics. In the past decade alone, social and cultural allocations in the national budget have tripled.
　　Marshal Choibalsan emphasized that all the achievements of the Mongolian people in developing their economy and culture, in consolidating national independence, and in building a happy and free life, even the very fact of their country's existence and development, are due to their great and selfless friend—the Soviet people—and to the fraternal care and attention of the great Stalin. After the Second World War, thanks to the help of the great Soviet Union and the victory of the Chinese people, the international status of the Mongolian People's Republic has been unprecedentedly strengthened.

　　在苏联援助下向社会主义迈进
  　蒙古经济文化成就辉煌
    中国人民胜利使蒙古国际地位空前强固
    【新华社北京二十八日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯，蒙古人民共和国总理却尔巴桑元帅在真理报上新发表的题为“走向社会主义途中的蒙古人民”一文中（摘要昨日已发），说明了蒙古人民共和国成立二十五年来在经济与文化方面的辉煌成就。
    蒙古在苏联兄弟般大公无私的援助下建立工业，已得到巨大成就。从一九四○年到一九四九年，国有工业的总产量已增加到百分之二百八十。却尔巴桑元帅并指出了一个伟大的远景，那就是：建立牲畜饲养合作社（现已有一二一家）并发展蒙古新的农业部门，以改组分散的、小规模的畜牧经济。蒙古境内已建立了现代化的摩托运输，奠定了发展航运的基础，建筑了约一千公里的优良公路。在过去十年中，车辆总数已增加了一倍半。连结共和国首都乌兰巴托尔与苏联的铁路，已于十月革命三十二周年纪念日通车，这条铁路对于蒙古的经济、文化及国民经济新部门的进一步发展，有着特别巨大的重要性。
    在文化发展方面：目前共和国计有四百一十二个初等学校、十四个专门学校，一个为党的干部与政府机关的人员设立的高等学校和一个国立大学。在二十五年中，在学人数增加了一百二十六倍。现在，共和国每十个居民中，就有一人在初等或中等学校，或在高等教育机关学习。以俄文为基础的新字母已推行全国，这就帮助了蒙古人民接受苏联人民进步的社会主义文化。全国人民已有百分之五十五点四能运用新字母。蒙古文化逐步发展的一个标志，就是报纸刊物的发展。现在国内共有八家中央报纸、十四家地方报纸和十四种期刊。马列主义的经典著作、世界文学作品及进步科学家出色的著作，都已经或正在译成蒙古文。年青的蒙古科学家都团结在蒙古科学委员会内，该委员会在苏联科学院的帮助之下，为整个国民经济的发展而协调与指导科学的研究。这些年来，在医药服务的发展方面也有了显著的改进。由于苏联的帮助，共和国业已建立了医院、医疗中心站、药房、妇婴谘询站。仅仅过去十年间，国家预算中社会与文化的拨款就已增加了三倍。
    却尔巴桑元帅强调指出：蒙古人民在发展经济与文化方面、在巩固国家独立方面、在建设幸福自由的生活方面所获得的一切成就，甚至他们国家的存在与发展这一事实，都应归功于他们伟大而无私的朋友——苏联人民，归功于伟大的斯大林的兄弟般的关怀和注意。第二次世界大战之后，由于伟大苏联的帮助和中国人民的胜利，蒙古人民共和国的国际地位已空前地强固了。
