　　Preparations for Unified Levy of Income Tax and Business Tax on Profit-Making Enterprises in Beijing to be Completed; 90% of Those Subject to Provisional Tax Payment Have Already Paid
    [Our Newspaper] Preparations for the unified collection of income tax and business tax on profit-making enterprises in Beijing are nearing completion. The total amount remains at 2 million shares, with each share of regular tax equivalent to 12 jin of millet, plus a 10% surcharge for education and health expenses. The tax share allocation for each industry, after six rounds of repeated discussions by the Municipal Promotion Committee and multiple investigations by tax bureau cadres, has been submitted to the Beijing Municipal People's Government for approval.
    [Another Report] Since the provisional collection of income tax and business tax on profit-making enterprises in Beijing began on November 18th, 3.6 billion yuan has been deposited into the treasury as of yesterday (the 26th), completing 95% of the total target of 3.8 billion yuan. To accommodate the difficulty for industrial and commercial enterprises to make concentrated payments and to meet the actual needs of government expenditures, the Municipal Promotion Committee decided on November 16th that before the discussion of the unified collection of income tax and business tax on profit-making enterprises at the Representatives Conference of All Circles, industrial and commercial enterprises should first pay a portion of the tax—based on the income tax share allocation for the second half of 1948. For those whose share is 15 or more, each share should pay 4 jin of millet first, with each jin calculated at 600 yuan. Those whose share is below 15 can also voluntarily pay in advance, but it is not mandatory. Once the share allocation for each industry and each enterprise is assessed, all advance payments will be deducted. After this measure was decided, industrial and commercial enterprises expressed satisfaction because they could pay in installments, and they enthusiastically made payments to the treasury. For example, over 500 industrial and commercial enterprises under 15 shares in the Second Tax Bureau voluntarily applied to pay. Within days, the provisional collection work has smoothly approached completion.

　　京市营利事业所得税和营业税
  　统征准备工作将完成
    预征纳库者已达十分之九
    【本报讯】北京市统一征收营利事业所得税和营业税的准备工作即将完成，此次总分仍为二百万分，每分正税十二斤小米，附征十分之一的教育卫生费，各行业纳税分数经市推进委员会六次反复讨论及税局干部多次调查后，已呈请北京市人民政府批准。
    【又讯】北京市营利事业所得税和营业税预征工作，自十一月十八日开始以来，至昨（二十六）日止，已纳库三十六亿元。完成总数三十八亿元的百分之九十五。为照顾工商业户集中缴款的困难，与政府开支的实际需要，在十一月十六日的市推进委员会上，讨论决定：在各界代表会议讨论统一征收营利事业所得税和营业税之前，工商业户先缴纳税款—部，依一九四八年下半年营利事业所得税的分数，凡每户负担分数在十五分以上者每分先纳四斤小米，每斤按六百元折合计征，在十五分以下愿意先行纳库者亦可，但不硬性规定，待各业业分及各户的分数评定后，一律扣除。此办法决定后，工商业户由于能分期缴纳，都表满意，缴款纳库十分踊跃，如税务第二分局十五分以下的工商业户五百余家，都自行申请缴纳，数日之间，预征工作便顺利的接近完成。
