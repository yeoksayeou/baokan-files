Xinhua News Agency, South China Front, 13th: Cuiheng Village, Zhongshan County, the hometown of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, was liberated on the morning of November 2nd. On the afternoon of the same day, a unit of the People's Liberation Army continued from there to Qianshanzhai, only six li from Macau. More than 3,000 bandits from a regiment of the 109th Army and the remnants of the pseudo-Guangdong Provincial Security Division fled in panic across the river to the west. The People's Liberation Army pursued bravely, killing and wounding over a hundred bandits, capturing over three hundred alive, and seizing a batch of weapons. When the People's Liberation Army pursued the fleeing bandits southward from Shiban Zhou in Zhongshan County, it received enthusiastic support from the people of the county. The people of the Guiwu Mountain area spontaneously organized bicycle transportation teams and civilian labor stretcher teams to help the People's Liberation Army transport ammunition and supplies. A certain area also sent 1,500 civilian laborers and more than 300 bicycles to advance with the army, assisting in transportation so that the People's Liberation Army could pursue and annihilate the enemy lightly.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 13th: The 12th was Mr. Sun Yat-sen's birthday. Chen Yi, Mayor of Shanghai, and Pan Hannian, Deputy Mayor, of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government, visited Madam Sun, Vice-Chairman Song, at her residence at 11:00 a.m. to extend greetings and visited Mr. Sun's former residence at 7 Gaoshan Road. The house had been left unrepaired for a long time during the rule of the Kuomintang reactionary government, and was badly damaged. The People's Government began recruiting workers to repair it in August.
