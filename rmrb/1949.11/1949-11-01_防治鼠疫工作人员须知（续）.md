　　Chapter II: Important Information for On-site Epidemic Prevention Work

    Eighth, Attention to Living, Eating, Sleeping, and Movement

    A. Diet: 1. Do not drink raw water; always have boiled water available for drinking. 2. Do not eat raw vegetables; all food must be cooked. 3. Disinfect tableware by boiling. 4. Vegetables should be disinfected with bleaching powder or potassium permanganate solution when necessary. 5. Rinse your mouth with a 1/1000 potassium permanganate solution before each meal and wash your hands (disinfect) with a 1-2% cresol soap solution before meals. 6. Do not overeat or drink excessively.

    B. Sleep: 1. Sprinkle lime inside the room before going to sleep, then take out the sleeping bag and check carefully for fleas before using it. 2. Hang up your clothes on a rope, then get into the sleeping bag, tightly fastening the bag's neck around your mouth, ensuring free breathing; it is even better to put your head inside the bag. Fasten the bag opening before sleeping. 3. Get enough sleep to recover from fatigue. 4. When getting up, first take off the bag and check for fleas (if there are fleas, you should pay attention to checking for symptoms in the future). 5. After tidying up the bag and luggage, proceed with other actions.

    C. Movement: 1. Do not walk beyond the ditch; consider the area outside the ditch as an infected area. 2. Do not count money (banknotes) or use it (as it easily carries bacteria; if you must count or use money, wrap it in clean paper after counting, and disinfect your hands afterward). 3. Do not interact with outsiders or exchange items. 4. Set up one or two guards to monitor outsiders and prevent them from approaching the residence.

    Ninth, Preparation and Precautions Before Entering the Plague Area from Residence

    1. First, put on a protective suit, tightening the cuffs, trouser legs, and sock openings. 2. When wearing rubber gloves, apply talcum powder to your hands first, otherwise, they will be difficult to put on. 3. Prepare the equipment to carry: A. Equipment: aerosol disinfectant sprayer, thermometer, injection needle, syringe, alcohol lamp, rat trap, rat-catching iron tongs. B. Medicines: carbolic acid, cresol soap solution, lime, sulfur, alcohol, iodine. C. Consumables: medicated cloth, cotton wool, bandages, seals, injection certificates, paste, rat poison, pencil, small knife, sterile petri dishes, test tubes, puncture needles. D. Bedside log, work log, and various attachments, etc.

    Tenth, Handling and Attention to Infected Households

    First, investigate the infected households in the epidemic area clearly. If there is more than one household, they can be divided into several groups, arriving at the infected households together, sealing off the infected households, and then waiting for the doctors to successively quarantine and handle them.

    A. Handling of Infected Households: 1. First, surround the infected household, do not enter the house. Immediately cut off traffic to the front and back of the house and the main gate, and assign someone to monitor to prevent people inside from escaping. 2. Then enter the sickroom and isolate the patient in the original room where the illness started, do not move them. Other people, such as family and relatives, must live in another room. 3. Neighbors in the courtyard should stay in their original places and not move. 4. Dig ditches around the infected household, one meter wide and one and a half meters deep, making the two sides of the ditch straight up and flatten them, preventing rats from climbing up; if possible, fill it with water. 5. First, spray the patient's and their family's living rooms with a 5% cresol soap solution, then sprinkle lime everywhere.

    6. Examine the patient: Pay attention to the date of onset, course of the disease, presence or absence of fever and swollen glands. If necessary, collect samples and place them in sterile containers for return to examination.

    B. Handling of Family and People in the Same Courtyard (Implementation of Health Quarantine): 1. Conduct health diagnoses, isolate suspected cases (these healthy individuals can be examined in the courtyard). 2. Implement health quarantine for healthy individuals. 3. Observe and examine daily. 4. Preventive vaccination (although vaccination during the incubation period can promote early onset of plague and aggravate the course of the disease, it can also be given. Because it cannot be immediately determined whether family members and people in the courtyard are infected, vaccination can prevent future infection).

    C. Precautions for Preventive Vaccination: 1. Suspected cases should not be vaccinated, as vaccination can worsen the severity of the disease. 2. Severe pulmonary tuberculosis, heart disease, and kidney disease should not be vaccinated. Individuals with thymic lymphatic constitution can suddenly collapse and die after vaccination. 3. Pregnant women should reduce the dosage or administer it in three doses, as it can sometimes cause miscarriage after vaccination. 4. Precautions during vaccination: ① Syringes and injection needles must be disinfected by boiling. ② The injection site must be disinfected with alcohol or iodine. ③ The injection site should be subcutaneous, preferably on the upper arm, front chest, or scapular region. ④ Be careful not to inject the vaccine into a blood vessel (after the needle tip enters the skin, first draw back; if no blood is drawn, then inject). ⑤ Bathing, strenuous exercise, and drinking alcohol are prohibited on the day of injection and the following day. ⑥ When opening and closing the injection liquid bottle, wipe and disinfect with an alcohol cotton swab, and shake thoroughly before use. After use, store in a cool, dark place. ⑦ The interval between each injection is five to seven days. ⑧ The injection volume should be increased or decreased according to age, the standards are as follows: For those over fifteen and under fifty years old: First time 0.5CC Second time 1.0CC Dosage reduction for the elderly and children as shown in the table below: Children from six months to five years old First time 0.2CC Second time 0.3CC Children from five to ten years old First time 0.3CC Second time 0.5CC Those from eleven to fifteen years old and over fifty-one years old First time 0.4CC Second time 0.7CC

    (Note) The concentration of vaccines varies in different places, so inject according to the instructions.

    Eleventh, Traffic Blockade Method

    1. Roads in front of, behind, left, and right of the infected household must be strictly blocked off. 2. Hang a red cloth or other locally prescribed sign at the entrance of the infected household as a danger warning. 3. One or two people can be stationed at each intersection to monitor traffic, preventing the movement of pedestrians and livestock (domestic animals and poultry). Dogs and cats should be tied up to prevent them from running around, or killed. Dig ditches on traffic roads to prevent large vehicles from passing through. 4. Send a special person to deliver daily necessities to the infected household or designated location to prevent people from the infected household or epidemic area from going out to shop.

    Twelfth, Handling of Onset and Suspected Cases

    1. First, an isolation ward should be established, with severe, mild, and suspected cases isolated separately. If the patient's house is suitable, it can be used as an isolation ward. Otherwise, another isolation ward should be found. Assign a dedicated person to be responsible for the patient's diet and care, and provide them with necessary knowledge about protection. 2. Pneumonic plague and septicemic plague should be isolated separately. 3. Patients with initial onset or mild symptoms should be given sulfa drugs quickly for treatment. 4. If necessary, surgery can be performed to remove swollen glands, and then sulfa preparations should still be given. 5. The isolation period for suspected cases is ten to fourteen days. During the isolation period, body temperature and symptoms such as swollen glands should be checked daily. If they develop symptoms, they should be treated in the same way as patients. 6. Those who have not developed symptoms can only be released from the ward after fourteen days and given preventive vaccination.

    Thirteenth, Handling of Healthy Individuals (Family, Neighbors)

    1. First, send them to a health isolation ward. 2. Conduct health diagnoses daily. 3. Pay attention to body temperature and swollen glands. 4. If they develop symptoms, isolate them. 5. Preventive vaccination can be given.

    Fourteenth, Handling of Corpses

    1. Mourning rituals for the dead are prohibited. 2. Family members are prohibited from moving the corpse. 3. First, spray the corpse with 5% carbolic acid or cresol soap solution. If you want to save disinfectant, you can singe the corpse with grass before placing it in the coffin. 4. Move it into the coffin and sprinkle it with lime (if a coffin can be prepared, do so). Disinfect the outside of the coffin, have others carry it to the cemetery and bury it in the ground or cremate it under guidance. 5. The depth of burial should be more than eight feet. 6. Use plenty of firewood for cremation, place the corpse in the middle, and add firewood around it to burn it. The abdomen and brain are the most difficult to burn, so soybean oil or kerosene can be poured on them. Only leave after the corpse has turned to ashes.

    Fifteenth, Corpse Dissection

    1. First disinfect the clothes and the corpse before cutting open the skin to open the chest and abdomen. After opening the chest, immediately open the heart to take blood for bacterial culture. 2. If dissection cannot be performed and it is bubonic plague, a large syringe with a coarse needle can be used to puncture and aspirate lymph fluid (or pus), lungs, spleen, liver, etc. for examination. 3. If a dissection has been performed, take a small portion of the lungs, spleen, or liver for examination. 4. Be careful during dissection to prevent knives, scissors, sutures, or bone spurs from injuring your hands to avoid infection. If there is any injury, stop working immediately, forcefully squeeze the wound to bleed heavily, then strictly disinfect with iodine and take a large dose of sulfa preparations. 5. Do not perform dissections vigorously to prevent blood from splashing on your body.

    Sixteenth, Disposal of Dead People's Houses

    1. First, open the rat holes (if they were previously sealed). 2. Then seal the windows and doors tightly, pasting them with paper, leaving only the door. 3. Place sulfur in an iron basin, placing it in the middle of the ground, with stones and bricks or adobe underneath. 4. Pour alcohol on the sulfur and light it. 5. People quickly retreat outside the room and seal the exit, using sulfur smoke to fumigate for seven hours. 6. Pay attention to dead rats when opening. 7. Burn sulfur, and epidemic prevention personnel must personally open the sickroom. 8. The amount of sulfur used must be twenty to thirty grams per cubic meter.

    Seventeenth, Handling of Dead Rats

    1. If a dead rat is found, report it quickly and do not move it. 2. Epidemic prevention personnel should go to the scene in person and first spray it with 5% carbolic acid or cresol soap solution. The surrounding area should also be disinfected, because after a diseased rat dies, the fleas on its body will quickly jump away. 3. Pick it up with rat-catching iron tongs or other substitutes, wrap it up, and burn it in place or nearby. 4. If necessary, dissect it to collect examination materials (swollen glands).

    Eighteenth, Handling Method for Captured Live Rats

    1. Leave the captured live rat in place. 2. Then pick up the rat cage and rat with iron tongs (do not pick it up by hand) and immediately immerse it in disinfectant (10% carbolic acid or cresol soap solution) or boiling water until it drowns. Alternatively, singe its fur with fire first, then dispose of it. 3. Cremate it with intense fire.

    Nineteenth, Precautions for Epidemic Prevention Workers During Work

    1. Empty your bowels and bladder before working. Do not smoke, eat, urinate, defecate, remove masks and head covers during work, to avoid bringing bacteria into your mouth or respiratory tract when your hands are unclean. 2. If you accidentally break your fingers or other exposed parts during work, immediately press hard to make it bleed heavily, then disinfect with iodine several times, and take sulfa drugs. 3. All work must be handled quickly, accurately, and carefully. 4. After moving corpses and patients, immediately perform whole-body spray disinfection before continuing to work.

    Twentieth, Precautions Before the Epidemic Prevention Team Returns to Residence

    1. Organize the items to be brought back. 2. When leaving the epidemic area to the intersection or outside the isolation line, immediately carry out personal whole-body spray disinfection. 3. Disinfection of items brought back (if necessary). 4. Disinfect and change clothes after reaching the disinfection station, as described in Article Six above.

    Twenty-first, Propaganda Method

    1. In the epidemic area, epidemic prevention personnel should go to each household for examination. At the same time, use the local language and examples to repeatedly explain the advantages and disadvantages of plague, break superstitious ideas, and make them understand the importance of isolation. Record the situation of sick households, patients, and various epidemic areas, using the actual situation as propaganda material. It is easiest to move people, use clever methods to enlighten and educate the masses, break superstition, and resolutely oppose witchcraft and gods by appropriate methods. 2. Organize residents in the epidemic area to monitor each other and report patients, and they must not interact with each other. 3. In the prevention area, wall newspapers, cartoons, slogans, and blackboard newspapers can be made, and Yangko dances and short plays can be performed for publicity. 4. All gatherings must be stopped in the epidemic area. 5. Conducting propaganda to district and village cadres and activists can go deeper into the masses and achieve greater results. 6. Take the lead in work, such as blocking rat holes for the masses, moving boxes and cabinets, sunning clothes and bedding, and sprinkling small amounts of ash. On the one hand, you can achieve practical results in epidemic prevention, and on the other hand, you can complete the mission of thorough propaganda.

    Twenty-second, Method of Choosing a Cemetery

    1. It must be far away from the old cemetery or the cemeteries of various families. 2. It is best to dig a ditch around the cemetery for those who die from plague and set up a sign to explain it. 3. The location should not be too low to prevent floods from washing out rats and bacteria-carrying corpses and infecting others. 4. The pit should be dug first, and the depth must be more than eight feet. 5. Monitor everyone approaching the cemetery to prevent the spread of infection.
