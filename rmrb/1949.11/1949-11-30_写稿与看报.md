Writing Articles and Reading Newspapers
    Peking University Correspondence Group Li Si

    A classmate from the correspondence group, because the articles he wrote were not adopted by the newspaper, sighed and said: "I really don't know how to write articles, I can't grasp the key points, and as a result, it's a waste of time!" He seemed a little discouraged. I asked him: "Today's newspaper has two very well-written communications, did you see them?"
    "No."
    "Do you usually pay attention to reading newspapers?"
    "I'm too busy, I have very little time to read newspapers."
    "That's it, how can you write good communications if you don't read newspapers?" I said.

    We often do this: we only care about writing in a hurry. As soon as we see something big happening in the school, such as holding a Youth League Day, the Chinese music group holding a meeting, etc., we grab it and write. We don't think about what role this article should play in the newspaper? What position does it occupy in the news of Beijing? Because we rarely read newspapers, we don't know what's happening outside. For example, the government is busy carrying out an epidemic prevention campaign, but we write communications about the Chinese music group holding a meeting and submit them to the newspaper. As a result, when we see that it is not published, we don't know why. For example, the Second Congress of Representatives was held in Beijing, and we didn't pay attention to it. As a result, we lightly let go of how the students and teachers reacted. Thus, on the one hand, we feel that it is impossible to start writing, there is no subject matter, and we don't know the center; on the other hand, we neglect the things that should be reflected and need to be reflected.

    Where is the problem? If you don't read newspapers, you don't understand the actual situation, and you write about the school's affairs in isolation from the outside world. It is easy to be out of touch with reality and unable to cooperate with the newspaper's reporting policy within a certain period of time. In this way, the communication cannot play a certain role in reality, and of course the newspaper will find it difficult to publish everything.

    The frustrating experience of writing articles without reading newspapers tells us: only by understanding reality can we write things that are closely related to reality and can guide reality.

　　写稿与看报
    北大通讯组  李思
    一位通讯组的同学，由于所写的稿，未被报馆采用，太息地说：“我真不知道要怎样写稿，抓不住重心，结果花了时间也是白费！”有点灰心的样子，我问他：“今天报上有两篇通讯，写得很好，你见了没有？”
    “没有。”
    “你平日注意看报吗？”
    “我太忙了，看报的时间很少。”
    “是了，不看报，怎么想写好通讯呢？”我说。
    我们往往是这样，只顾忙着写，一看见学校里有什么大事，如举行团日，中乐组开会等事项，抓着就写，也不通过自己的思索，这篇稿在报纸上，应当起怎样的作用？在北京市新闻消息中，占什么样的地位？由于很少看报的缘故，外界发生些什么事情，也不知道。如政府正忙于开展防疫运动，我们却写些中乐组开会的通讯投到报社里去，结果看见没登出来，也不知是啥道理。又如京市召开了二届代表会议，我们也不注意，结果，同学，先生们的反映如何，倒轻轻放过。于是，一方面感到写稿无从着手，没有题材，不知中心；一方面，又把应该反映，需要反映的东西，忽略过去了。
    这问题是在那儿呢？不看报，不了解实际情况，把学校里的事，与外界的事，孤立起来写。就容易与现实脱节，不能与报纸一定时期内的报导方针配合。这样，通讯不能对现实起一定的作用，当然报纸就难以把什么都登出来了。
    不看报光写稿的碰壁经验告诉我们：只有了解现实，才能写出与现实密切结合，而能指导现实的东西来。
