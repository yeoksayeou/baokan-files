In July 1914, the Tsarist government announced a general mobilization for the imperialist war. By 1917, three consecutive years of bloody fighting had plunged the people into hunger, poverty, and death. All of Russia's resources were exhausted, the national economy was bankrupt, and workers, peasants, and soldiers could no longer endure this situation, and extremely hated the Tsar, so they heroically stood up against the war! Demanding peace, bread, and freedom! Even the bourgeoisie at the time began to be dissatisfied with the Tsar. In February 1917, the Russian Bolshevik Party led workers, peasants, and soldiers in an armed uprising, overthrowing the rule of the Tsarist government, and the February Revolution broke out.

The February bourgeois democratic revolution was victorious under the leadership of the working class. In the initial days of the revolution, Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies were formed everywhere. However, because most Bolshevik leaders were still in prison or in exile, the positions of many Soviet representatives were unfortunately occupied by compromise parties - the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries. They led the Soviets and Executive Committees of Petrograd, Moscow, and other cities, thus creating a situation in Russia where two powers coexisted: one was the bourgeois regime - the Provisional Government, and the other was the proletarian regime - the Soviets of Workers', Peasants', and Soldiers' Deputies. It was not until Lenin and Stalin returned to Petrograd in April from their forced exile in Switzerland that the situation changed drastically.

As soon as Lenin returned, he pointed out: "The peculiarity of the present situation in Russia is that it is a transition from the first stage of the revolution to the second stage, the first stage giving power to the bourgeoisie owing to the inadequate consciousness and organization of the proletariat, the second stage placing power in the hands of the proletariat and the poorest sections of the peasants." ("April Theses") And put forward the slogan "All power to the Soviets", leading the working class to fight against the bourgeois Provisional Government. In the economic field, it proposed confiscating the landlords' land, nationalizing all of it, merging all banks into a state bank, and supervising it by the Workers' Deputies Soviet, implementing supervision over social production and the distribution of products. From Lenin's return to the October Revolution, in these few months, the Russian Bolsheviks carried out large-scale political work at the front and in the rear, in factories, villages, and barracks, realizing the most difficult task at the time, attracting the majority of the working class, the Soviets, and millions of peasants to the socialist revolution.

In October, the Central Committee of the Russian Bolshevik Party saw that the revolutionary opportunity was fully ripe, so according to Lenin's instructions, it decided to start an armed uprising. The Central Committee dispatched plenipotentiaries to Donbass, the Urals, Helsinki, the Southwest Front, the Western Front, and other places to prepare to organize uprisings to assist the uprising in the capital, Petrograd. Under the Petrograd Soviet, a Revolutionary Military Committee was established as the public headquarters for commanding the uprising. Comrade Stalin led this military committee.

On the eve of the uprising, two capitulationists in the Central Committee—Zinoviev and Kamenev—opposed the uprising, and after being severely criticized, they publicly published fallacies in the newspapers. The traitor Trotsky also publicly revealed the date of the uprising to the enemy at a meeting of the Petrograd Soviet. As a result, the bourgeois Provisional Government hurriedly convened a secret meeting and transferred troops to Petrograd, attempting to attack and capture Smolny—the location of the Bolshevik Central Committee—the day before the Bolshevik uprising.

The Central Committee of the Bolshevik Party then decided to advance the date of the uprising by one day, launching it on October 25th (November 7th Gregorian calendar). At 2:00 AM on October 24th, the "Provisional Government" ordered the closure of the Bolshevik Party's central organ, "Worker's Path," and dispatched armored vehicles to attempt to occupy the "Worker's Path" editorial office and printing plant. However, at 10:00 AM, according to Comrade Stalin's order, the Red Guards and revolutionary soldiers drove away the armored vehicles and guarded the entrance of the "Worker's Path" editorial office and printing plant. At 11:00 AM, "Worker's Path" was published, with a large-font headline calling for "Overthrow the Provisional Government." At the same time, Comrade Stalin immediately transferred revolutionary soldiers and Red Guards to Smolny. The uprising began! On the night of October 24th, Lenin arrived in Smolny and personally led the uprising forces, driving all night to surround and attack the Provisional Government's lair—the Winter Palace.

On October 25th, the revolutionary army and the Red Guards occupied the railway station, post office, telephone exchange, government departments, and the State Bank. In street battles, the Petrograd workers accurately carried out combat orders and fought side by side with the Red Guards. The navy also launched the "Aurora" cruiser from Kronstadt to bombard the Winter Palace, and by late at night, the Winter Palace was captured, and the authorities of the "Provisional Government" were arrested.

On the night of the uprising, the Second All-Russian Congress of Soviets opened in Smolny. The Congress issued a declaration to the people of the whole country, announcing that the bourgeois Provisional Government had been overthrown and that all power had been transferred to the Soviets. The next day, the Congress passed two decrees: a "Decree on Peace," announcing an immediate end to the imperialist war; and a "Decree on Land," announcing "the immediate abolition of private land ownership by landlords without any compensation," and distributing the landlords', royal family's, and monastery's land to the peasants for use without compensation. At the same time, the first Soviet government—the Council of People's Commissars—was established, and Lenin was elected as the first Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars. Outside of Petrograd, uprisings followed. By December 1918, the socialist revolution had spread throughout Russia, and the great October Revolution had won complete victory.

The young Soviet regime defeated the counter-revolutionary riots of Denikin, Kolchak, etc., repelled the armed intervention of fourteen imperialist countries, thus defending the world's first socialist country, and with the triumphant return of the Soviet regime, immediately embarked on the road of economic construction, declaring to the world: The state of the working people - the Soviet Union, can withstand any test, it is strong and invincible.

　　苏联十月革命节简史
    本报资料室
    一九一四年七月，沙皇政府宣布了进行帝国主义战争的总动员令，至一九一七年，连续三年的血战，使人民陷于饥饿、贫困、死亡的境地。全俄的资源消耗殆尽，国民经济破产，工人、农民、士兵，对于这种境遇不能再忍受下去，极端痛恨着沙皇，于是英勇地站起来反对战争！要求和平、面包和自由！当时就连资产阶级也开始对沙皇不满意。在一九一七年二月，俄国布尔塞维克党便领导着工人、农民和士兵举行武装起义，推翻了沙皇政府的统治，爆发了二月革命。
    二月的资产阶级民主革命在工人阶级的领导下胜利了。在革命最初几天，各地就组成了工人、士兵代表的苏维埃。但由于布尔塞维克多数领袖还在狱中或在放逐地，后来许多地方苏维埃代表的位置，不幸被妥协的政党——孟塞维克和社会革命党占了多数，他们领导了彼得堡、莫斯科及其他城市的苏维埃和执行委员会，遂使俄国形成了两个政权并存的局面，一个是资产阶级政权——临时政府，一个是无产阶级政权——工、农、兵代表苏维埃。直到列宁与斯大林在四月相继从被迫侨居的瑞士回到彼得堡以后，情势才急剧地转变过来。
    列宁一回来就指出：“俄国现今时局的特点就在于从革命第一阶段过渡到革命第二阶段，第一阶段无产阶级底觉悟性和组织性不够，而把政权交给了资产阶级，而第二阶段则应当把政权交给无产阶级和最贫苦农民阶层之手。”（四月提纲）并提出“一切政权归苏维埃”的口号，领导工人阶级向资产阶级的临时政府作斗争。在经济方面提出没收地主的土地，全部收归国有，把一切银行合并为一个国家银行，并由工人代表苏维埃加以监督，施行对于社会生产和生产品分配的监督。从列宁回国以后到十月革命，这几个月当中，俄国布尔塞维克在前线和后方、在工厂乡村和兵营里进行了大规模的政治工作，实现了当时最困难的任务，把工人阶级中的、苏维埃中的多数人以及千百万农民都吸引到社会主义革命方面来。
    到了十月，俄国布尔塞维克党中央委员会看到革命时机已经完全成熟，于是根据列宁的指示决定开始武装起义。中央委员会分派全权代表到顿巴斯、乌拉尔、赫尔森福斯、西南前线、西方战线以及其他各地，准备组织起义，以援助首都彼得格勒的起义。在彼得格勒苏维埃之下成立了革命军事委员会作为指挥起义的公开司令部，领导这个军事委员会的是斯大林同志。
    正当起义前夕，中央委员会的两个投降主义者—季诺维也夫和加米业夫，他们反对起义，而在受到严厉的批评后，竟在报纸上公开发表谬论。叛徒托洛斯基也在彼得格勒苏维埃会议上公开把起义的日子泄露给敌人。这一来资产阶级临时政府就慌忙地召开秘密会议，把军队调到彼得格勒，企图在布尔塞维克起义的前一天进攻和打下斯莫尔雷—布尔塞维克中央委员会所在地。
    布尔塞维克党中央遂决定把起义的日子提早一天，在俄历十月二十五日（公历十一月七日）开始发动。十月二十四日清晨二时，“临时政府”下令封闭布尔塞维克党的中央机关报“工人之路”，并调派铁甲汽车企图占据“工人之路”编辑部及印刷所，但是上午十点钟，根据斯大林同志的命令，赤卫队和革命士兵把铁甲汽车赶走了，并在“工人之路”编辑部和印刷所门前加岗保卫，到上午十一点钟“工人之路”出版了，用很大的字登出“推翻临时政府”的号召，同时斯大林同志立刻把革命士兵和赤卫军调到斯莫尔雷去。起义开始了！十月二十四日夜间，列宁到了斯莫尔雷，亲自领导起义队伍，整夜开动着去包围和攻打临时政府的巢穴——冬宫。
    十月二十五日革命军队和赤卫队占领了火车站、邮政局、电话局、政府各部、国家银行，在巷战中，彼得格勒工人确切执行了战斗的命令，和赤卫队并肩作战。海军方面也发动了喀隆施塔得的“阿芙乐尔”巡洋舰向冬宫开炮轰击，到深夜，就攻下了冬宫，逮捕了“临时政府”的当局。
    在起义的这天夜间，第二次全俄苏维埃代表大会在斯莫尔雷开幕了，大会向全国人民发表宣言，宣布资产阶级的临时政府已被推翻，全部政权已经转入苏维埃手中。第二天大会又通过了两个法令：一个“和平法令”，宣布立刻停止帝国主义战争；一个“土地法令”，宣布“毫无代价地立刻废除地主土地私有制”，把地主的、皇族的和寺院的土地都无报酬地分给农民使用。同时成立了第一届苏维埃政府——人民委员会，选列宁为第一届人民委员会主席。在彼得格勒以外的地方，也跟着起义。到一九一八年一二月间，社会主义革命就普及到全俄国，伟大的十月革命获得了完全的胜利。
    年青的苏维埃，战胜了邓尼金、科尔恰克等的反革命暴动，击退了十四个帝国主义的武装干涉，因此保卫了世界上第一个社会主义的国家，并且随着苏维埃政权的凯旋，立即踏上经济建设的道路，向全世界宣告：劳动人民的国家——苏联，经得起任何考验，她是强大和无敌的。
