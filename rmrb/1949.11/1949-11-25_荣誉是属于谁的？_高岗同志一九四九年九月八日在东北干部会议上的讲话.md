　　To Whom Does Honor Belong?
    Comrade Gao Gang's Speech at the Northeast Cadre Meeting on September 8, 1949

    Comrades! I am raising this question for discussion with everyone.

    We are now transitioning from war to construction. The central task of the entire party and all the people in the Northeast is economic construction, and all other work serves to promote economic construction. In the past, we also engaged in construction, but it was a combination of war and construction. Now, we have completely transitioned to construction, so this is a major historical shift. Based on the new historical situation, many new issues have arisen within our party, in the united front, and among the broad masses, requiring the party to resolve them.

    The broad masses in the Northeast suffered fourteen years of plunder by the Japanese invaders, followed by plunder by the Kuomintang reactionaries in many areas, and then went through three years of the Liberation War. Now that we have won, the masses demand to recover their strength and improve their lives. We must seriously address these demands of the masses in the Northeast and integrate the task of economic construction with the demands of the masses. This requires us to learn new skills. In this situation, our party comrades, who are to shoulder the great task of economic construction, as Chairman Mao pointed out: some of the things we are familiar with are becoming idle, or are about to become idle, and we are being forced to do things we are unfamiliar with. Although the majority of cadres in our party are actively working for the revolutionary cause and have done much valuable work for the people during the land reform and the Liberation War, they are both largely unfamiliar with the new task of economic construction, with the current specific economic work and other construction work, and lack spiritual re-preparation. Therefore, they cannot put their energy into the new tasks and new work. Many cadres have not truly settled down in their specific work posts and have not truly devoted themselves to studying them. This has resulted in a somewhat abnormal and volatile phenomenon during this transition period, lacking the high enthusiasm and drive that existed during the land reform and war periods. The peaceful environment and some of the negative influences of urban life have also contributed to the development of this phenomenon, and some individuals have even become degenerate and corrupt as a result. This is a serious problem that should be brought to our attention.

    Economic construction is different from the land reform and war tasks of the past. It is a long-term and permanent task, and it is also a very complex, meticulous, and arduous work. It is not a matter of shouting slogans or showing off, but requires hard work and dedication. Without the extraordinary efforts of the entire party and all the people, without a new atmosphere, a new drive, and a new spirit of enterprise, it will be impossible to do this work well. Therefore, the objective situation requires all our cadres to stand firm in their work posts, establish a spirit of enterprise and study for the current specific revolutionary cause, and dedicate all their energy and wisdom, demonstrating a high degree of initiative and creativity, working diligently, overcoming difficulties, and fulfilling the entrustment of the country and the people. We communists have the great ideal of turning the world upside down and are consciously dedicated to the revolutionary cause, serving the people with loyalty. We have extreme contempt for any decadent ideas of seeking personal fame, status, and material enjoyment. In our minds, the cause of the people, the country, and the party should be and must be above all else, governing everything, and there must be no thought or action for personal gain. Whoever does not recognize this truth will be abandoned by the people. As a communist party member, one must have a high revolutionary spirit, work selflessly, put aside all personal considerations, and work as much as possible for the people and the country, setting an example for the general public. If we examine the situation of cadres in the Northeast party in the light of this requirement, we can find that there are still some comrades who cannot meet this requirement and have not played the role they should play. And some comrades still have various degrees of misunderstanding of the issues of honor, status, and material treatment, which are hindering the progress of our cause.

    In terms of the new spirit of enterprise, the current situation of cadres in the Northeast party can be divided into the following three different types:

    The first type is those who are active and hardworking, full of vitality, able to overcome difficulties in practical work, discover problems, solve problems, complete tasks, and create new experiences. They study their work at all times, do not talk empty words, do not complain about difficulties, work hard and accurately complete and exceed work plans. They never care about personal honor, status, or material treatment, but concentrate all their thoughts on how to do the work well, and how to better complete and exceed the tasks entrusted by the country and the people. As for the honor, status, and material treatment given to them by the people based on the size of their contribution to the country, for these comrades, they are "external things" and not something they are concerned with. They can push the cause forward, and they can create experience in exploration and research, improve themselves, and help other comrades to progress. These comrades are the backbone of the party, the honor of the party, the honor of the people, and their own honor. We should praise the new spirit of enterprise of these comrades, and praise their experience and achievements. However, there are not many such cadres in the current Northeast party. There are also people among non-party cadres who have this kind of initiative for the cause, but not many.

    The second type is those who follow the rules step by step, stick to the old ways, lack a sense of new things, are content with the small achievements of the moment, and can make some achievements when working conditions are smooth, but lack courage when encountering difficulties, and do not step forward, but are at a loss or retreat in the face of difficulties. They also have abstract ideas of doing the work well, but they have few solutions when they encounter new problems. Their working methods are often general and abstract, and they do not truly study problems, and do not specifically propose solutions to problems. They hold meetings all day long, but are not practical, and cannot draw new experiences from solving problems to educate cadres and promote the cause. They generally obey the organization, but also calculate personal interests, and when they are not "satisfied," they cannot be down-to-earth and concentrate on studying the cause. There are still many cadres of this type in the current Northeast party.

    Why does this situation arise? On the one hand, these comrades do not have enough understanding of the transformation, are unfamiliar with the new work, and are reluctant to abandon the old working methods that are no longer suitable for today's conditions. Subjectively, they lack a strong spirit of enterprise, and therefore lack the spirit to overcome difficulties, and do not know how to analyze difficulties, find solutions, solve problems, and find pleasure in overcoming difficulties. On the other hand, the leadership has not done enough to help, educate, inspire, and guide these comrades in the process of transformation. These comrades are basically good and have the desire to progress, and can be educated. Our party should strengthen education and organizational leadership in this area, and mobilize these cadres to learn from the first type of cadres; take various measures to encourage them, improve them, and every small progress they make should be appropriately encouraged, in order to create an atmosphere of competing for progress, and taking progress and activity as glory, and being content with the status quo as shame. If we can make this type of cadres learn from the first type of cadres, and the first type of cadres can be more modest and prudent, and forge ahead bravely, then the face of the party will be renewed, the relationship between the party and the people will be closer, and the progress of all work will be given an infinite new impetus. (⑴⑵)

    The third type is those who do not seek progress, do not study and improve their work, but specialize in talking big, talking empty words, following the trend, showing themselves everywhere, and even putting on airs, liking to talk about fame and status, and caring about material enjoyment. Their ability is not great, but their personal desires are quite high. Those on the supply system often think about which level they are, but never consider how their contribution to the cause deserves to be at which level, and do not think about raising the cause to a higher level, but only want to raise their own position. Those on the salary system often think about how many points they should get, but do not calculate the points of the country and the people's income, that is, how to cherish state property, improve working methods, save a few points on the state's expenditure, and increase a few points on the people's interests. This kind of people often haggle over personal gains and losses, but do not pay much attention to work, and rarely or never consider how the tasks given to them by the state can be better completed, holding a perfunctory attitude of "doing or not doing, it's all the same." Some of them believe that because they are old, they should have great honor, high status, and more material enjoyment. They divide revolutionary work into noble and lowly, talk about interests, and seek comfort, trying to put in as little effort as possible and enjoy as much as possible. When their personal desires cannot be satisfied, they complain about the party and want the party to promote them frequently to be happy; after working for a long time, they express boredom, and even suppress new forces. When they see the rising cadres progressing, they do not applaud and welcome them, but are angry and jealous, and obstruct their path, thinking that the party is unfair to them. But the more they are obsessed with personal gains and losses, pursuing personal status and enjoyment, the more they cannot wholeheartedly serve the people, and therefore the more they cannot complete the tasks entrusted by the country and the people well, and at the same time the more they do not progress, and therefore the more they should not receive honor, status, and higher material treatment. Because the party and the people can never allow neglecting the interests of the country and the people, and accommodating certain personal interests.

    Comrades! Sacrificing the interests of the people to accommodate personal interests is absolutely not allowed. This is a matter of principle! Like the third type of cadres we are talking about, although they are a very small minority in the party, they are not individual. If they do not change, they will become an obstacle to the advance of the revolution, and may even be in danger of degeneration and degradation, and their past glory and existing "status" will also be lost. Because the revolution is not "conferring titles," the position of the revolution is not "hereditary," and the cause of the revolution is constantly advancing. Our party must resolutely overcome this evil spirit and cannot allow it to exist and grow. Otherwise, it will be a great harm to the revolution.

    We communists are made of special materials, that is to say, we have the thoughts and qualities of the proletariat, can sacrifice all personal interests to fight for the revolutionary cause, and overcome all difficulties in our work. Then, why are there still phenomena of not being energetic and enthusiastic about the people's cause, but haggling over personal gains and losses,贪图享乐 (tántú xiǎngshòu- seeking pleasure), and even dereliction of duty and violation of discipline, and corruption? This is due to the combination of certain corrupt feudal remnants of consciousness and the individualistic thoughts of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie and their reflection within the party, and there are still many shortcomings in our organizational work and educational work, which is also one of the reasons for the growth of this bad phenomenon.

    Why has this phenomenon been reflected more in recent times? This is because there is no war in the Northeast, and they have settled down in big cities, and they have not deeply realized that they are shouldering a greater and more arduous construction task. As a result, many comrades have relaxed spiritually and allowed all non-proletarian consciousness to erode themselves and the party, which is very dangerous. We must strengthen our organizational work and educational work a thousand times and carry out serious and appropriate struggles against all non-proletarian thoughts that erode the party.

    Of course, this is only a general analysis of the attitude of cadres in the Northeast party towards the new spirit of enterprise, and it is far from summarizing the entire situation. Many cadres are not entirely the same as the above three types.

    Comrades! To whom should our honor and the status and material treatment associated with it belong?

    Speaking of this question, every communist party member should at least recognize that these things should first be attributed to the working class and to the masses of the people. As everyone knows, if we do not rely on the masses of the people, we communists will not be able to accomplish anything. The masses of the people are the driving force of history. The honor of our revolution and construction belongs first and foremost to the masses of the people. The improvement of status and material treatment also belongs first and foremost to the masses of the people. Only when the masses of the people have status and improve their status can we communists have status to speak of. Our revolution and construction are to enable the masses of the people to obtain a better and higher material life and cultural life. If we do not strive to develop the cause of construction, and gradually improve the material life and cultural life of the masses from the development of the cause of construction, so that the masses can first receive the fruits of the revolution and construction, but only care about our personal material life, if we do not first care about the clothing, food, housing, and transportation of the masses of the people, but only care about our own clothing, food, housing, and transportation, then, for us communists, it is completely shameful and contemptible degeneration. Our personal material life problems cannot be isolated from the material life problems of the masses. Only after the masses of the people have obtained honor, status, and material treatment can we talk about the honor, status, and material treatment problems between communist cadres and non-party cadres.

    The only goal we communists should pursue is to do the work well in any position, and contribute all our wisdom and ability to the people's cause, without caring about personal gains and losses. From the perspective of our revolutionaries themselves, we must understand that the highest interests of the vast majority of the people are also the highest interests of us communists. This is the highest criterion of our interests, and there is nothing else. As for "honor," that is the encouragement given to you by the people based on your contribution to the entire cause. "Status" is the responsibility given to you by the people, and "material treatment" is the appropriate reward given to you by the people based on your contribution to the specific cause. This reward is not an average "supply," nor is it based on boasting and deception, but depends on the size of your actual contribution to the people's cause. The greater your contribution to the country and the people, the higher the honor, status, and material treatment the people give you. This is directly proportional.

    For example, Zhao Fuyou, a lathe worker at the Shenyang Machine Tool Factory, created a new record for turning "lead screws" at 3.09 points at the end of January. This type of turning "lead screws" operation took 23 points for other workers in the first test, and 13 points in the third test, while the "theoretical" standard operating time for turning "lead screws" is generally 6.45 points. Zhao Fuyou's creation shortened the time by nearly 20 points compared to the first test, and saved 3 points and 36 minutes compared to the "theoretical" time. Because Zhao Fuyou concentrated on his work and had a new creation, he should enjoy the honor he deserves, so the newspaper used a front-page news item to praise his heroic deeds, and the Ministry of Industry is also preparing to give him a material reward. Because he has contributed to the people, the people give him the honor, status, and material treatment he deserves. Therefore, we say that the people who should receive honor, status, and higher material treatment must be those who are actively hardworking, diligent in research, overcome difficulties, and complete and exceed the tasks of the country and the entrustment of the people. We assess all cadres, party and non-party factory managers, commercial and trade personnel, educational workers, government workers, military workers, party workers, etc., with this standard, and there can be no other standard.

    The standard for our party to select cadres is virtue, talent, and seniority. Virtue is loyalty to the people's cause, talent is the ability to complete the tasks entrusted by the people, and seniority is his experience in struggle and the scale and closeness of his connection with the masses of the people. These three are not isolated from each other, but are interconnected. Talent must of course be seen in the ability to complete specific tasks, but virtue and seniority are also not abstract. It depends on his contribution to the country and the people. If there is no contribution, that is, he cannot serve the people loyally, then how can he be called virtuous? The history of struggle is of course valuable, but its value lies in its contribution to the people. This contribution cannot be interrupted and should continue to be maintained and developed, and do more and more responsible work for the people. The party and the people are eagerly expecting this from us. But if we stop and do not progress, and have no contribution to the people, then there is nothing valuable.

    All party and non-party cadres should understand that any revolutionary position and any revolutionary work are noble. It cannot be said that that kind of work is not important, because without the cooperation of other work, no work can solve problems in isolation. Every revolutionary comrade should cherish their position, stand firm in their position, and actively and responsibly do their work well. Don't look at which kind of work is "popular" and go "catch the wave," or be discouraged because you can't catch up. This is a kind of individualistic emotion that must be overcome.

    We must come up with some specific methods to promote and organize the initiative and creativity of various party and non-party workers. First of all, we must educate cadres and party members to establish and strengthen the new spirit of the revolutionary cause, give full play to revolutionary heroism, and strive to complete and exceed the tasks they bear. Party cadres should first set an example for the masses. We must emphasize the unity of national interests and personal interests. We must subordinate personal interests to collective interests, and improve personal ideological ability, work ability, and living standards in the development and improvement of the entire social production cause. Secondly, we must check and improve our existing organizational structure and various systems, so that they are fully adapted to the new requirements, and truly receive the role of promoting and developing the initiative and creativity of cadres, and truly receive the role of rewarding the good and criticizing the bad. In the organization, we must implement a graded division of labor and personal responsibility system. In the system, we must implement a system of promotion and demotion of cadres. According to the cadres' contribution to the people, we must boldly promote and use them, and not excessively accommodate "qualifications," because this is detrimental to the cause. There must be a correct reward and punishment system, praising and rewarding the good, and criticizing and punishing the bad. Rewards should not only be honorary awards, but also material awards, so that those who have made greater contributions to the people can enjoy higher material treatment, which is completely reasonable. We must highly promote the spirit of enterprise in society and within the party, and advocate creation, so that the people's heroes are respected everywhere and become examples for everyone to learn from. We must launch a struggle against corruption, waste, dereliction of duty, and violation of discipline. Those who are seriously derelict in their duties and violate discipline should be dismissed from their posts and investigated. Those who are seriously corrupt and waste state property should be severely punished. In addition, we must also stipulate and implement a salary system, a recuperation system, etc. We must adhere to this principle, that is, the cause comes first, and completing the tasks entrusted by the people and the country comes first. The honor granted by the country and the people, as well as the status and material treatment associated with it, should also be given to those comrades who have a creative spirit for the people's cause and complete the most and the best tasks. These comrades will be respected by the party and respected by the people!

    Comrades! I hope that the entire party and all the people in the Northeast, especially the party and non-party working cadres, will stand firm in their production and work positions, establish a new spirit of enterprise, create new production and work records, increase the scores for the income of the country and the people, advance our economic construction, and improve the material life of the people, so as to more powerfully support the national war and build the Northeast into a national industrial base. This is our great and glorious task.

　　荣誉是属于谁的？
    高岗同志一九四九年九月八日在东北干部会议上的讲话
    同志们！我提出这样一个问题来同大家研究。
    我们现在是由战争转变到建设，东北全党与全体人民的中心任务是经济建设，一切其他工作都是为搞好经济建设服务的。过去我们也搞过建设的工作，但那是一面战争一面建设，现在却完全转变到建设，所以这是一个历史的大转变。根据新的历史情况，在我们党内，在统一战线中，在广大群众中，就发生了许多新的问题，要求党来解决。
    东北广大群众受了日寇十四年的掠夺，随后许多地区又受了国民党反动派的掠夺，并经过了三年的解放战争，现在胜利了，群众要求恢复元气，要求提高自己的生活。我们必须认真解决东北群众这样的要求，把经济建设任务和群众要求结合起来。这就要求我们学会新的本领。在这种情况下，我们党内同志，来担负伟大的经济建设任务，正如毛主席所指示的：我们熟悉的东西有些已经闲起来，有些快要闲起来了，我们不熟悉的东西正在强迫我们去做。虽然我们党内大多数干部对于革命事业是积极努力的，并在土地改革与解放战争中曾经为人民做了不少的可贵的工作，但因为对新的经济建设任务，对当前具体的经济工作与其他建设工作，一方面是还十分不熟悉，另一方面则是还缺乏精神上的重新准备。因此，对于新的任务，新的工作，还使不上劲。很多干部还未在具体的工作岗位上真正安定下来，真正用心去钻研。这就产生了在这一过渡时期内某种不很正常的、动荡的现象，缺乏象在土地改革与战争时期那样高涨的热情与劲头。而和平的环境，城市生活的某些不良影响，也助长了这种现象的发展，并且有个别的人因此走向堕落和腐化。这是一个严重的问题，应该引起我们深切注意的。
    经济建设，与过去时期的土地改革与战争任务不同，它是长期的永久的任务，同时又是很复杂、很细致、很艰巨的工作。这不是喊口号的工作，也不是出风头的工作，而是需要埋头苦干的工作。如果没有全党与全体人民的非凡努力，没有一种新的气象、新的劲头与新的事业精神，要搞好这一工作是不可能的。因此，客观形势要求我们所有干部，都要站稳自己的工作岗位，树立对当前具体的革命事业的进取与钻研精神，拿出自己的全部精力与智慧，发扬高度的积极性和创造性，兢兢业业，克服困难，完成国家与人民的付托。我们共产党人，是具有翻天覆地的伟大理想的，是自觉地献身于革命事业，为人民忠诚服务的战士。我们对于任何贪图个人名誉地位与物质享受的腐朽思想，都是极端鄙弃的。在我们的思想中，应该是而且必须是人民的、国家的、党的事业高于一切，统治一切，而绝不能掺杂有为个人打算的思想与行为。谁不认识这个真理，谁就会被人民所抛弃。作为一个共产党员来说，必须要有高度的革命精神，忘我地工作，撇掉一切个人的打算，为人民、为国家工作得愈多愈好，以做一般人民群众的表率。如果拿这样一个要求来检讨我们东北党内干部的情形，那便可以发现，还有若干同志不能达到这样的要求，还没有发挥他们所应起的作用。而有些同志对于荣誉、地位、物质待遇等问题，还存在着各种不同程度的错误认识，阻碍着我们事业的前进。
    就对于新的事业精神来说，现在东北党内干部的情形，有以下三种不同的类型：
    第一种，积极努力，生龙活虎，能在实际工作中克服困难，发现问题，解决问题，完成任务，并创造新的经验。他们时时刻刻钻研工作，不讲空话，不喊困难，埋头苦干，很准确地完成并超过工作计划，他们从不计较个人的荣誉、地位或物质待遇，而把自己的全部思想集中在如何做好工作，如何更好的完成与超过国家与人民所托付的任务。至于人民根据他们对国家的贡献大小所给予荣誉、地位与物质待遇，对于我们这些同志来说，乃是“身外之物”，并不是这些同志所斤斤计较的东西。他们能把事业推向前进，他们能在摸索与钻研中创造经验，提高自己并帮助其他同志进步。这类同志是党的骨干，是党的荣誉，人民的荣誉，也是他们自己的荣誉，我们应该表扬这类同志的新的事业精神，表扬他们的经验和成就。但是这类干部，在目前东北党内还不很多。非党的干部中也有对事业具有这种积极性的人，但为数也不甚多。
    第二种，按步就班，墨守成规，缺乏对新鲜事物的感觉，安于一时一地的微小成就，工作条件顺利时，也可做出若干成绩，但碰到困难，便缺乏勇气，不是挺身而出，而是束手无策或知难而退。他们也有抽象的把工作搞好的念头，但是遇到新问题，办法很少。其工作方法经常是一般的、抽象的，而不会真正钻研问题，具体提出解决问题的办法，成天开会，不落实际，不能从解决问题当中得出新的经验，以教育干部、推进事业。他们一般地服从组织，但也盘算个人利益，在不“如意”时，就不能踏踏实实，专心钻研事业。这类干部的数量，目前在东北党内还是不少的。
    为什么产生这种状况呢？一方面由于这些同志对转变没有足够认识，对新的工作不熟悉，而对过去已不适合于今天条件的工作方法，却舍不得丢弃。主观上缺乏坚强的事业进取心，因而缺乏克服困难的精神，不会分析困难，找出办法，解决问题，从战胜困难中求得愉快。另一方面领导上在转变的过程中对于这些同志的帮助、教育、启发、引导，做得不够。这些同志基本上是好的，也有进步的愿望，是可以教育的。我们党应该在这方面加强教育与组织领导，动员这类干部向第一类干部看齐；采取各种办法，鼓励他们，提高他们，他们每一微小进步，都应受到适当的鼓励，以便造成一种竞相追求进步的风气，以进步积极为光荣，以安于现状为可耻。我们若能使这一类干部向第一类干部看齐，而第一类干部，更能戒骄戒躁，奋勇前进，那便会使党的面貌为之一新，党与人民的关系更加密切，而一切工作的进展也将获得无限的新的动力。（⑴⑵）
    第三种，不求进步，不研究改进自己的工作，专门讲大话，说空话，赶浪头，处处表现自己，甚至摆老资格，好讲求名誉、地位，计较物质享受。能力不大，个人的欲望颇高。供给制的常想自己是那一级，但从不考虑自己的贡献事业，值得算那一级，不是想把事业提高一级，只是想把自己地位提高。薪金制的常想自己该得多少分数，但却不计算国家与人民收入的分数，即如何爱护国家财产，改进工作方法，使国家的支出节约几分，使人民的利益增加几分。这类人常常斤斤于个人的利害得失，对工作却不甚用心，很少或从不考虑国家给予自己的任务应如何方能更好地完成，抱着“干不干，一斤半”的敷衍塞责的态度。其中有些人认为资格老，就应该荣誉大，地位高，物质享受多。对革命工作分贵贱，讲兴趣，图舒服，出力越少越好，享受越多越好。当他们私欲不能满足时，反而抱怨党，要党经常提拔他才高兴；工作一久，就表示厌倦，甚至压制新生力量，看到后起的干部进步了，不是鼓掌欢迎，而是气愤嫉妒，拦路阻碍，认为党对他不公平。但愈是醉心于个人的得失，追求个人的地位和享受，则愈是不能全心全意为人民服务，因而也就愈加不能很好地完成国家与人民所付托的任务，同时也就愈不进步，也就愈加不应获得荣誉、地位和较高的物质待遇。因为党和人民决不能允许不顾国家的、人民的利益，而去迁就某些个人的利益。
    同志们！牺牲人民利益去迁就个人的利益，这是绝不能允许的，这是一个原则问题！象我们所说的第三类干部，目前在党内虽是极少数，但并非个别的，如果他们不改，便会变成革命前进的阻碍，甚至有堕落蜕化的危险，而他们自己过去的光荣以及已有的“地位”也会丧失掉。因为革命不是“封爵”，革命的地位是没有“世袭”的，革命的事业是不断前进的。对于这种邪气，我们的党必须坚决克服，不能允许其存在与滋长。不然对革命是很大的危害。
    我们共产党人，是特殊材料制成的，这就是说我们具备有无产阶级的思想与品质，可以牺牲一切个人的利益为革命事业奋斗，并克服一切工作中的困难。那末，为什么还有对人民事业不起劲，不热情，而去斤斤计较个人得失，贪图享受，甚至渎职乱纪，贪污腐化的现象呢？这是由于某些腐朽的封建残余意识与资产阶级、小资产阶级的个人主义思想相结合及其在党内的反映，而我们的组织工作与教育工作中还存在很多缺点，也是使这种恶劣现象滋长的原因之一。
    为什么这种现象在近来反映较多呢？这是由于东北没有战争了，并在大城市住下来了，而又未深刻认识自己的肩上担负着更伟大、更艰巨的建设任务。因而不少同志在精神上松懈下来，而让一切非无产阶级意识侵蚀着自己，侵蚀着党，这是十分危险的事，我们必须千百倍地加强我们的组织工作与教育工作而与各种侵蚀党的非无产阶级思想进行严肃而适当的斗争。
    当然，这只是就东北党内干部对于新的事业精神所持态度的大体分析，这还远不能概括全部的情形，有许多干部与以上三种类型还不尽相同。
    同志们！我们的荣誉以及与之相联系的地位与物质待遇应该属于谁呢？
    说到这一个问题，每一个共产党员起码应该认识，这些东西首先应归之于工人阶级，归之于人民大众。大家知道：如果不依靠人民大众，我们共产党员是什么也搞不成的。人民大众是历史的动力。我们革命与建设的荣誉，首先是人民大众的。地位与物质待遇的提高，也首先是人民大众的。只有人民大众有了地位，提高了地位，我们共产党员也才有地位可说。我们的革命与建设，是要使人民大众获得更好又更高的物质生活和文化生活。如果不去努力发展建设事业，从发展建设事业去一步一步地使群众的物质生活和文化生活向上改善，使群众首先受到革命与建设的果实，而只关心我们的个人物质生活，如果不首先去关心人民大众的衣食住，而只关心自己的衣食住，那末，对于我们共产党人来说，就完全是可耻的，是可鄙的堕落。我们个人的物质生活问题，是不能够从群众的物质生活问题孤立出来的，只有人民大众获得荣誉、地位和物质待遇之后，我们方可以说到关于共产党干部与非党干部个人之间的荣誉、地位和物质待遇问题。
    我们共产党人所追求的唯一目标，应该是在任何岗位上把工作搞好，把全部智慧、能力贡献给人民事业，而不计较个人的得失。从我们革命者本身来说，我们必须懂得最大多数人民的最高的利益也就是我们共产党人最高的利益，这是我们利益的最高准绳，除此之外，别无其他。至于“荣誉”，那是人民根据你对于整个事业的贡献而给予你的鼓励，“地位”则是人民给你的责任，“物质待遇”则是人民根据你对具体事业的贡献而给你的适当的酬劳。这种酬劳不是平均的“供给”的，也不是靠吹嘘与蒙哄，而是要看你对人民事业的实在的贡献大小而定。你对国家与人民的贡献愈大，人民给你的荣誉地位物质待遇也就愈高，这是成正比例的。
    比如沈阳机器一厂旋盘工人赵富有，于一月底以三点零九分，创造车“丝杠”新纪录，这种车“丝杠”作业，在别的工人第一次试验时用二十三点，第三次还用了十三点，而车“丝杠”“理论”标准作业时间一般为六点四十五分。赵富有的创造，比第一次试验时缩短将近二十点，比“理论”时间节省了三点又三十六分。因为赵富有专心事业，有了新的创造，因之他应该享受应得的荣誉，所以报纸用头条消息表扬他的英雄事迹，工业部还准备给他以物质奖励。因为他对人民有贡献，因之人民给他以应得的荣誉地位与物质待遇。所以我们说应该得到荣誉、地位与较高的物质待遇的人，必须是积极苦干，努力钻研，克服困难，完成并超过国家的任务与人民的付托的。我们考核一切干部，党的与非党的工厂管理人员、商业贸易人员、教育工作人员、政府工作人员、军事工作人员、党务工作人员等等，都要用这个标准，而不能有其他的标准。
    我们党选择干部的标准是德、才、资。德是对人民事业的忠诚，才是完成人民委托的能力，资是他的斗争经验和他与人民群众联系的规模和密切的程度。这三者不是各自孤立的，而是互相联系的。才固然要看具体完成任务的能力，但德与资也都不是抽象的，要看其对国家与人民的贡献，假若没有贡献，就是不能为人民忠诚服务，那如何能称为有德？斗争历史固然可贵，但其所以可贵，是在于对人民有贡献，这种贡献不能使之中断，应继续保持与发扬下去，为人民做更多的更加负责的工作，党与人民都是这样殷切期望我们的。但若停步不进，对人民又无贡献，那就没有什么可贵之处了。
    一切党内外干部都应当明了：任何一种革命岗位，任何一种革命工作，都是高贵的。不能说那种工作是不重要的，因为离开其他工作的配合，任何工作都不能孤立地解决问题。每个革命同志应该珍爱自己的岗位，站稳自己的岗位，积极地、负责地、把自己的工作搞好。不要看那一种工作“吃香”，都去“赶浪头”，或者因为赶不上而灰心丧气。这是一种个人主义的情绪，必须克服。
    我们要想出一些具体的办法，把各种党的与非党的工作人员的积极性、创造性发扬起来，组织起来。首先，要教育干部和党员，建立和加强革命的新的事业精神，发挥革命的英雄主义，努力完成与超过自己负担的任务。党的干部应首先作群众的榜样。要强调国家利益与个人利益的一致性。要把个人利益服从于集体利益，在整个社会生产事业的发展与提高中来提高个人的思想能力、工作能力与生活水准。其次，要检查和改进我们现有的组织机构与各种制度，使之完全适合新的要求，真正收到能推进发扬干部的积极性与创造性的作用，真正收到奖励好的，批评坏的作用。在组织上要实行按级分工，个人负责制。在制度上要实行干部的升降制度，根据干部对人民的贡献，实行大胆的提拔和使用，不要过分去迁就“资格”，因为这样是与事业不利的。要有正确的奖惩制度，表扬与奖励好的，批评与惩罚坏的。奖励不仅有荣誉奖，同样要有物质奖，使那些对人民贡献较大享有较高的物质待遇，这是完全合理的。要在社会上及党内高度发扬进取精神，提倡创造，使人民的英雄到处受尊敬，成为大家学习的榜样。要展开反贪污浪费与渎职乱纪的斗争，对于严重的渎职乱纪行为应予撤职查办，对于严重贪污及浪费国家财产的应该受到严厉的惩处。此外，并要规定与实行薪水制度、休养制度等。我们必须坚持这样一个原则，这就是事业第一，完成人民与国家所托付的任务第一；国家与人民所赠予的荣誉以及与之相关联的地位与物质待遇，也应给予那些对人民的事业有创造精神的，完成任务最多最好的同志，这些同志，将受到党的尊敬，与人民的尊敬！
    同志们！我希望东北全党、全体人民，尤其是党与非党的工作干部，站稳自己生产与工作的岗位，树立新的事业精神，创造新的生产与工作的纪录，为国家与人民的收入增加分数，将我们的经济建设推进一步，把人民的物质生活提高一步，以便更有力地支援全国战争，将东北建设成全国的工业基地。这就是我们伟大而光荣的任务。
