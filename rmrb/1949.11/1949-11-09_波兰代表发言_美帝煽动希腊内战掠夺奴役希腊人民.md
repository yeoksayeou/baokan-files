　　Polish Representative Speaks
  　American Imperialism Incites Greek Civil War to Plunder and Enslave the Greek People
    On the morning of November 1st, Polish representative Mr. Suchi emphasized in the meeting: For four years, the United Nations has been attempting to solve the Greek issue and prevent the atrocities of the Greek royalist fascist regime. However, all these efforts by the United Nations and the Mediation Committee have failed due to the unforgivable stance of the United States. In the United States' aggressive plans, Greece and Turkey are calculated together as its military springboard in Europe, from where the United States plans to launch aggressive wars against the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries. It was for this purpose that Truman announced his doctrine and began American military and political intervention in Greece. The Truman Doctrine is a tool for enslaving Greece and turning it into a military base for attacking its northern neighbors. Following military occupation, economic intervention saw the United States place Greece under its complete control. Now, American companies control Greek industry and the entire economy. American military and political representatives decide on issues such as organizing the Greek government. American military delegations appoint Greek ministers, while American officers command military operations. They also appoint commanders of the royalist fascist army. The Polish representative cited concrete facts showing that the Greek royalist fascists have leased the Greek people to American monopoly capitalists who are plundering and exploiting the Greek people. He cited statements made by American officials, including former U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ickes, proving that the so-called U.S. "aid" to Greece is to suppress the people's movement and keep the royalist fascists in power. These few royalist fascists who have sold themselves to American monopoly capitalists are selling out the Greek people and artificially inciting the Greek civil war.
    In the afternoon political committee meeting, the head of the Soviet delegation, Mr. Vyshinsky, spoke. He criticized the speeches of the American and British representatives on October 31st. He pointed out that the Greek issue is being used by pursuers of world hegemony to achieve the paths by which they desire to build world hegemony through Greece.
    Before the committee adjourned, the head of the Soviet delegation, Mr. Vyshinsky, rose again to speak, requesting that the chairman of the committee report to the General Assembly on the progress of the General Assembly President's decision on the issue of the death sentences handed down by the Greek royalist court on October 27th to nine Greek democratic movement leaders and the suspension of the execution of these sentences. The chairman of the committee replied to the Soviet delegation's question that the General Assembly President would report on this issue to the committee later.
    Thus, the general debate on the Greek issue concluded.

　　波兰代表发言
  　美帝煽动希腊内战掠夺奴役希腊人民
    十一月一日上午，波兰代表苏琪在会议中着重指出：联合国四年以来，一直企图解决希腊问题和阻止希腊保皇法西斯政权的暴行。但联合国和调解委员会方面的这一切努力，由于美国方面的不可宽恕的立场而告失败。在美国的侵略计划中，希腊与土耳其一同被盘算作为其在欧洲的军事跳板，从那里，美国计划发动进攻苏联和人民民主国家的侵略战争。正是为了这一目的，杜鲁门宣布了他的主义，开始了美国在希腊的军事和政治干涉。杜鲁门主义是奴役希腊并把它变成进攻其北部邻邦之军事基地的工具。继军事占领之后的经济干涉，美国把希腊置于它的完全控制之下。现在，美国公司控制着希腊的工业和整个经济。美国军事和政治代表决定着象组织希腊政府这种的问题。美国军事代表团任命希腊的部长，而美国军官则指挥着军事行动。他们并且还任命保皇法西斯军的指挥官。波兰代表引证具体事实，显示希腊保皇法西斯已把希腊人民租让给掠夺和剥削着希腊人民的美国垄断资本家。他引证美国官员包括前美国内政部长伊克斯在内所发表的声明证明：所谓美国对希“援助”乃是为了要镇压人民运动并保持保皇法西斯当权。这些屈指可数的已把自己出卖给美国垄断资本家的保皇法西斯，正出卖希腊人民，人为地煽动希腊内战。
    同日下午政治委员会的会议上，苏联代表团团长维辛斯基发言。他抨击了美英代表十月三十一日的演说。他指出希腊问题正在被世界霸权的追求者所利用，以便通过希腊而达到他们所欲赖以建立的世界霸权的那些途径。
    在委员会散会以前，苏联代表团团长维辛斯基再起立发言，要求委员会主席向大会报告联大主席对十月二十七日关于九个希腊民主运动领袖被希腊保皇法庭判处死刑及停止这些判决之执行的问题的决定，究竟已经进行得如何。委员会主席回答苏联代表团的质问说：联大主席以后将向委员会报告这个问题。
    这样对希腊问题的一般辩论就结束了。
