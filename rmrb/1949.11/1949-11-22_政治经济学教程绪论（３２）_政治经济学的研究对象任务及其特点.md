    Section Three: Marxist-Leninist Political Economics and the Chinese Revolution
    Marxist-Leninist Political Economics and the Basic Questions of Revolution
    The Chinese Communist Party, headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, based on the socio-economic content of China in the past century, and using the Marxist-Leninist standpoint, viewpoint, and method for analysis, determined that modern Chinese society was a semi-colonial and semi-feudal society, and its economy was a semi-colonial and semi-feudal economy. It proposed that the current task of the Chinese revolution was to oppose feudalism, imperialism, and bureaucratic capitalism. The objects of the current stage of the Chinese revolution are imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. It also determined that the entire Chinese revolution must be divided into two steps or two stages. The first step or the first stage is to change China's semi-colonial and semi-feudal social form into an independent, free, democratic, unified, and prosperous New Democratic society. This stage of the revolution is the New Democratic Revolution, and this stage of revolution is also the New Democratic Revolution stage. The second step or the second stage is to advance the revolution and establish a socialist society without exploitation. This is the Socialist Revolution or the stage of the Socialist Revolution. At the same time, based on China's international environment, the specific conditions of Chinese society, and the practical experience of the Chinese revolution, and using the basic theories of Marxist-Leninist political economics and the Marxist-Leninist class analysis method, it determined the objects of the Chinese revolution, the nature of the Chinese revolution, and the motive force of the Chinese revolution, pointed out the future and characteristics of the Chinese revolution, and more clearly put forward the dual tasks of the Chinese revolution and the leading position and decisive role of the Chinese Communist Party in the two stages of revolution.
    Historical materialism teaches us that the political structure of all societies is the superstructure of the economic structure of the society, and politics is the concentrated expression of economics. The nature of the revolution and the tasks of the revolution are determined by the nature of the society (the economic content of the society) and the requirements of social and economic development. The objects of the revolution and the motive force of the revolution are determined by the position and role of each class in the social economy. Therefore, to understand how the political structure of society is the superstructure of the social economy, how politics is the concentrated expression of the economy, to understand and distinguish the nature and tasks of the Chinese revolution in the current and future stages, and the relationship between them, to understand and distinguish the different revolutionary objects and revolutionary motive forces in each revolutionary stage and revolutionary period, and to determine and grasp our strategies, tactics, and the programs and policies for realizing these strategies and tactics in each revolutionary stage and revolutionary period, it is necessary to have a profound understanding and mastery of Marxist-Leninist political economics, and based on this, to conduct a profound scientific analysis and research on the class composition, class relations, and class status of Chinese society, and to conduct a correct, clear, profound, and specific analysis of the characteristics of the relations of production and the state of the productive forces in Chinese society. In other words, we must, according to the theoretical principles of Marxist-Leninist political economics, start from the actual investigation of the economic structure of Chinese society, observe how the Chinese social economy is constituted, how it changes, and what its laws of motion are, in order to understand the domestic and international economic conditions of China, its development and its development trend, and determine how it should develop, in what direction it should develop, and how to make it develop in this direction.
    Of course, under the specific conditions of China, not only must there be a deep study and understanding of China's domestic economic situation, but also a deep study and understanding of the economic situation of the capitalist countries, the economic situation of the socialist countries, and the economic situation of the colonial and semi-colonial countries related to China, in order to enable the Chinese revolution to grasp the correct domestic and foreign policies in this complex international environment. However, first or foremost, it is necessary to focus on, base on, and start from the research and mastery of China's actual economic situation, and the research on them must also be mainly for the needs of the Chinese revolution and the purpose of promoting the Chinese revolution.
    The Establishment and Development of the New Democratic Economy and the Historical Process of the Chinese Revolution
    The establishment and development of China's New Democratic economy is completely closely and inseparably linked with the entire process of the Chinese New Democratic Revolution. It is a product of the revolution, and it is also a major fundamental source of the material strength of the revolution. It is an indispensable force for promoting and ensuring the advancement and victory of the revolution.
    The New Democratic economy had already emerged and developed to a certain extent during the Soviet war period, that is, the Land Revolution period, after 1927. Later, due to changes in the situation, the main force of the Red Army was transferred, and the Soviet area became a guerrilla area, which was destroyed and sabotaged by the counter-revolutionary Kuomintang. During the Anti-Japanese War, in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and the anti-Japanese base areas behind enemy lines in North China, Central China, and South China, some areas continued the construction and development of the New Democratic economy on the basis of the land revolution before the war (such as some areas in Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia). Some areas gradually established and developed after the rent reduction and interest reduction policy after the Anti-Japanese War. In short, whether in the Soviet period or the Anti-Japanese War period, the emergence, establishment, and development of the New Democratic economy were due to the Chinese Communist Party leading the masses of the people through long and arduous wars and struggles, establishing the people's democratic regime, and after the implementation of revolutionary economic policies. The characteristic of the Chinese revolution is "armed people opposing armed counter-revolution," and it is in a state of long-term and cruel struggle. Therefore, the New Democratic economy cannot be established and exist without armed struggle and the protection of armed struggle, let alone develop. At the same time, it is impossible to imagine that this kind of armed struggle and the persistence and victory of armed struggle would be possible without the support of the New Democratic economy. Therefore, our economic construction, in the long revolutionary process until the victory of the revolution in the whole country, its main task should be to support the revolutionary war, ensure the supply of the revolutionary war, and ensure the victory of the revolutionary war.
    Therefore, war produces economy, protects economy. The economy supports the war, guarantees the war, and will eventually lead a backward, poor, oppressed, and ravaged agricultural China to a progressive, independent, prosperous, and powerful industrial China. This is the basic law of the emergence and development of China's New Democratic economy.

    第三章　政治经济学的任务意义与中国革命
    第三节　马列主义政治经济学与中国革命
    马列主义政治经常学与革命的基本问题
    中国共产党以毛泽东同志为首，根据中国近百年来的社会经济内容，运用马列主义的立场观点方法分析的结果，确定近代中国社会是半殖民地半封建的社会，经济是半殖民地半封建的经济，提出了中国革命现阶段任务是反对封建主义，反对帝国主义与反对官僚资本主义。现阶段中国革命的对象是帝国主义，封建主义与官僚资本主义。并确定了整个中国革命必须分为两个步骤或两个阶段，第一步或者第一阶段，就是改变中国半殖民地半封建的社会形态，使之成为一个独立自由民主统一富强的新民主主义社会，这一阶段的革命，就是新民主主义的革命，这个革命的阶段也就是新民主主义的革命阶段。第二步或者第二阶段，便是使革命向前发展，建立一个没有人剥削人的社会主义社会。这就是社会主义的革命或社会主义革命的阶段。同时他又根据了中国的国际环境，中国社会的具体情况与中国革命的实际经验，运用了马列主义政治经济学的基本理论，与马列主义的阶级分析方法，确定了中国革命的对象，中国革命的性质，中国革命的动力，指出了中国革命的前途与特点，更明确地提出了中国革命的两重任务与中国共产党在这两个阶段革命中的领导地位与决定作用。
    唯物史观教导我们，一切社会的政治结构都是社会的经济结构的上层建筑，政治是经济的集中表现。革命的性质与革命的任务决定于社会的性质（社会的经济内容）与社会经济发展的要求，革命的对象与革命的动力决定于社会各阶级在社会经济中所占的地位与所起的作用。因此我们要了解社会的政治结构怎样是社会经济的上层建筑，政治怎样是经济的集中表现，了解与区别现阶段与将来阶段中国革命的性质与任务，以及它们相互间的关联联络，了解与分明各个革命阶段与革命时期不同的革命对象与革命动力，确定掌握各个革命阶段与革命时期我们的战略战术与实现这些战略战术的纲领政策，是必须对马列主义政治经济学具有深刻的了解和掌握，并据此以对中国社会的阶级构成，阶级关系，阶级状态作深刻的科学的分析与研究，对中国社会生产关系的特点，与生产力状态作正确明晰深刻具体的解剖分析。这也就是说我们必须根据马列主义政治经济学的理论原则，从中国社会经济结构的实际考察出发，观察中国社会经济是怎样构成，怎样变动以及它运动规律又如何，借以了解中国国内外经济的状况，其发展及其发展趋势。并确定它应该怎样发展，向什么方向发展，并怎么样使它这样发展并向这个方向发展。
    当然在中国的具体状况下，不但对中国国内的经济状况必须有深刻的研究与了解，而且对于与中国有关的资本主义各国的经济情况，与社会主义国家的经济状况，以及殖民地半殖民地各国的经济状况，也都必须有深刻的研究与了解，始能使中国革命在这错综复杂的国际环境中掌握正确的对内对外政策。但是首先或者主要的，还是必须以中国本身的实际经济状况的研究掌握为中心，为根据，为出发点，而对于它们的研究也必须主要为了中国革命的需要和推进中国革命的目的。
    新民主主义经济的成立发展与中国革命的历史过程
    中国新民主主义经济的成立，发展是与整个中国新民主主义革命的过程，完全紧密而不可分离地结合着的，它是革命的产物，又是革命的物质力量的一个主要基本源泉。推动与保证革命前进与胜利的一个不可缺少的力量。
    新民主主义的经济，在一九二七年以后苏维埃战争时期，即土地革命时期，就已经产生成立，并且有了一定程度的发展。以后因为情况变化，红军主力转移，苏维埃区域变为游击区，遭受反革命国民党的摧毁破坏。抗日战争时期，在陕甘宁边区与华北，华中，华南各敌后抗日根据地，有的地区在战前的土地革命基础上继续了新民主主义经济的建设与发展（如陕甘宁某些地区）。有的地区则是经过抗战以后减租减息政策以后逐渐建立发展起来的。总之，无论在苏维埃时期也好，或者抗日战争时期也好，新民主主义经济的发生成立与发展，都是由于中国共产党领导了人民大众经过了长期残酷的战争与斗争，建立了人民民主的政权并在革命的经济政策实施以后，发生成立与发展起来的。中国革命的特点是“武装的人民反对武装的反革命”，并且处于长期残酷斗争的状态下，因此新民主主义的经济如果不在武装斗争与武装斗争的保护下便不可能成立与存在，更谈不到发展。同时这种武装斗争与武装斗争的坚持与胜利，如果没有新民主主义经济的支持，也是不可能设想的，所以我们的经济建设，在长期的革命过程中迄至革命在全国范围胜利以前，其主要的任务，是应当在于支援革命战争，保证革命战争的供给，保证革命战争的胜利。
    因此，战争产生经济，保护经济。经济又支持战争，保证战争，并终将把一个落后的贫困的被压迫被蹂躏的农业中国，引向进步的独立的富强的工业中国。这是中国新民主主义经济发生发展的基本规律。
