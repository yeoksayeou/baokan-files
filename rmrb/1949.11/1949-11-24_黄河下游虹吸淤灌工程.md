　　Siphon Silt Irrigation Project in the Lower Yellow River
　　Cao Ruizhi
    The "Siphon Silt Irrigation Project in the Lower Yellow River" is slightly more special than ordinary irrigation projects. It might be helpful to first explain the title: Take a bent pipe, insert one end into the water at a high point and place the other end on the ground at a low point. Suck out the air inside the pipe, and the water will flow out on its own. This action is called the siphon effect. The pipe used for this effect is called a siphon pipe, and the project that uses siphon pipes to draw water is called a siphon project. There are two main uses for drawing water on both banks of the lower Yellow River. (1) Silting and improving saline-alkali land, (2) Irrigating farmland. Therefore, the title is named the Siphon Silt Irrigation Project in the Lower Yellow River. This siphon project has its special points, which are explained in four aspects:

    1. The Yellow River is one of the world's great rivers, with a very large flow. The minimum is 220 cubic meters per second, and the maximum is about 29,000 cubic meters per second, which can be called an abundant water source.

    2. The Yellow River water contains a large amount of sediment. This kind of muddy water is exceptionally fertile. When irrigated into the fields, it is suitable for the growth of crops and can replace fertilizer.

    3. The lower reaches of the Yellow River extend for more than 700 kilometers from the Xingze Ferry in Henan to the Lijin estuary in Shandong. Except for 45 kilometers of mountainous area in Gengjia Mountain, Shouzhang, Shandong, the rest of the area is the famous great plain. The soil is mostly yellow soil, which is suitable for cultivation.

    4. The riverbed of the lower Yellow River has been raised due to years of siltation, so that the water in the river, even in winter, is often higher than the ground inside the dike, ranging from 8 centimeters to 3.5 meters throughout the year, which is conducive to water diversion.

    5. On the right bank of the Yellow River, the Jialu River and Huiji River in Henan Province, and the Xiaoqing River in Shandong Province, and on the left bank, the Wei River in Henan Province, and the Majia River and Tuhai River in Shandong Province can all be used as drainage channels.

    The above five conditions have created a vast irrigation area, which is truly a rare natural resource in the world. However, for thousands of years, the lower reaches of the Yellow River have only suffered from floods and have not benefited from water conservancy. Every time the Yellow River breaches its banks, countless lives and properties are lost. It is called a scourge, which has been the case since ancient times and is even more severe today. Therefore, the local residents only care about preventing disasters and have no time to talk about benefits.

    In 1928, Ruizhi served as a water conservancy engineer in the Henan Provincial Government. He was ordered to survey the Yellow River, with the intention of developing water conservancy in the Yellow River. During the survey, I thought about using the siphon principle to install iron pipes on the Yellow River embankment to divert water for irrigation, which might be possible. Because I was not very confident, I erected a four-inch iron pipe on the Huayuankou Dam in Henan to conduct a test. This pipe was bent according to the cross-sectional shape of the dam. One end was inserted into the Yellow River, and the other end was placed on the ground inside the dam. Both ends were equipped with cut-off gates, and a funnel was installed on the top of the pipe peak. When opening the pipe, first close the cut-off gates at both ends, fill the pipe with water, close the funnel, and then open the cut-off gates at both ends at the same time. As expected, the Yellow River water shot out and flowed continuously. Another test was conducted at Liuyuankou in Kaifeng, and the same result was obtained. The local people were overjoyed to see that they could divert water from the Yellow River to irrigate their fields without opening the dam. They all believed that from now on, the Yellow River water could be used to water the land. At that time, a plan was made to install eight sets of 24-inch siphon pipes on the south bank of the Yellow River, which had already been requested for approval and funding. However, due to changes in the situation, the project was stopped.

    In 1929, Ruizhi went to the Shandong Construction Department as a technician in the Water Conservancy Group and continued to carry out this work. When surveying to Youfang Zhaozhuang in Qihe County, I saw five stone gate openings built inside the Yellow River embankment. According to the locals, this was built by Zhang Yao, the former governor of Shandong Province, during the Qing Dynasty. The purpose was to reduce flood disasters and develop water conservancy, which was a very good intention. However, when they were about to open the dam to divert water, the masses rose up to refuse to move the dam. They knelt down and begged, and in the end, it was not opened. Today, the gate openings are still lined up majestically, and the remains still exist. This investigation made me see the psychology of the masses, who believed that the Yellow River embankment could not be opened, and that opening the embankment was the most dangerous thing. However, people with scientific knowledge do not think so. They believe that there may be methods to ensure that the embankment does not fail if gate openings and culverts are built on the embankment. However, in my opinion, it is safer and more appropriate to install siphon pipes than to open gate openings or build culverts. The reasons are as follows:

    (1) The water inlet part of the siphon pipe has a movable joint device that can be moved up and down. To irrigate fields, the pipe mouth is raised to draw water from the river surface; to silt water pools or low-lying, humid, and saline-alkali land, the pipe mouth is lowered to draw sediment from the riverbed. Gate openings and culverts do not have this advantage.

    (2) Because the siphon pipe can draw water from the river surface, it can draw water for irrigation regardless of floods or droughts. Culverts or gate openings are no different from siphon pipes in drought conditions, but during floods, the sediment at the bottom of the river enters the canals and causes severe siltation, which is not suitable. If equipment is used to draw water from the river surface, the water flow will fall after passing through the gate, resulting in a huge loss of head, and the flow will be greatly reduced. The siphon pipe has a siphon effect and does not have this loss.

    (3) The foundation construction of siphon pipes is easy to carry out, while gate openings and culverts are more difficult.

    (4) The siphon pipe can be installed on a ship and travel along the river. Water can be drawn and silted at any time wherever the river water approaches the embankment. Gate openings and culverts are fixed buildings and are not as convenient as siphon pipes.

    (5) The water blocking gates of culverts or gate openings for diverting Yellow River water for irrigation are easily silted up, while siphon pipes do not have this concern.

    From the above comparison and observation, it can be seen that installing siphon pipes is the best method of diverting water on the Yellow River embankment. Therefore, when I was in Shandong, I firmly believed that siphons would be successful and strongly advocated expanding the installation to expand irrigation. However, the general public was still skeptical, so repeated plans and suggestions to the provincial government were repeatedly rejected. After many twists and turns, it was not until 1934 that 21-inch siphon pipes were installed in Wangjialihang, Licheng County, and Mazhazi, Qingcheng County. The test results were very effective. It is remembered that Mazhazi used a flood to silt 600 mu of low-lying and saline-alkali land into fertile land, and harvested a lot of beans the following year. At that time, it attracted the attention of the government, so two sets of 36-inch siphon pipes were installed in Weijiashan, Dong'a, with a water absorption of 3 cubic meters per second per set, which could irrigate 170,000 mu of farmland. The original plan was to allow the water to flow into the North Grand Canal to support navigation after the land was silted. After the water intake station was completed, the water absorption test results were good. The Shandong Provincial Government believed that the siphon had been successful and allocated 400,000 yuan to carry out the siphon silt irrigation project near Lijin. At that time, a siphon boat was also designed, which was to install the water inlet part of the siphon pipe on the boat and put it into the river. The remaining sections of the pipe could be loaded and unloaded on the embankment at any time and sailed along the embankment to silt and irrigate the land inside the embankment. The contract had been signed, but the July 7th Incident broke out before construction could begin, and the project was stopped. Before the incident, the governments of the three provinces of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan established the Hebei-Henan-Shandong Siphon Project Survey Team, with two engineers from each province. Ruizhi served as the team leader. After the survey was completed, data was being collected to prepare a report, but the incident also ended the project. These materials are now stored at Li Xiangzhen's office in the Shandong Water Conservancy Bureau and can be used as a reference for future surveys of siphon projects. After the success of the Wangjialihang siphon pipe in Shandong, the Henan Provincial Government installed four sets of the previously planned 24-inch siphon pipes at Heigangkou in Kaifeng. The effect was even more remarkable. The Heigangkou water pool was one of the famous dangerous spots on the Yellow River, but it has now been silted up. The drinking water problem in Kaifeng City was also solved at the same time. There is also a water source on both banks of the Huiji River that can be used for irrigation.

    After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, in March 1947, the Huayuankou closure project was completed. In the Yellow River flood area, water passed through and sand remained, leaving thousands of miles of barren land with no grass growing. The Construction Department of the Henan Provincial Government, in its plan to rehabilitate the Yellow River flood area, decided to install siphon pipes on the Huayuankou Dam to divert water for silt irrigation and to support navigation. Ruizhi was entrusted by the department to carry out the design. After several months of surveying and design, he prepared a design book and drawings for the water diversion project and siphon water intake project in the Yellow River flood area. This design has two special points:

    (1) Install 24 sets of 58-inch siphon pipes near the upstream of the Huayuankou closure, with a water discharge of 80 cubic meters per second, using 40 cubic meters per second for silt irrigation of farmland and 40 cubic meters per second to support navigation.

    (2) Use the head drop of the water entering the canal to generate 1,000 KVA of electricity, and build a siphon water intake station at a high ground on the left bank upstream to use electricity to irrigate 100,000 mu of high-lying farmland.

    The first project is currently the largest siphon project on the Yellow River, with a diverted water volume that can irrigate 1.6 million mu of farmland. The second project proves that the water diverted by the siphon can generate electricity, providing power for saline land drainage, high ground irrigation, and rural industries. In Henan, the head is only 2 meters, so the effect is not very great. If the water diverted by the siphon in Shandong is diverted to the Xiaoqing River, the head may be more than 4 meters, which can double the development of power.

    In the past 21 years, there have been many failures, but a lot of experience has been gained from these failures, which are briefly described in seven aspects as follows:

    (1) Siphon location - In 1928, a water intake station was set up in Liuyuankou, Kaifeng, Henan, and three centrifugal water intake machines were installed. During the installation, the river water was close to the water intake station. In 1931, the river channel moved about two miles north, and the water intake station had to excavate a two-mile water diversion channel to draw water. It was too troublesome to clear the silt every year, so the siphon location must be chosen in a place where the river water never leaves the bank.

    (2) Water inlet - The water inlet of the siphon pipe in Henan was a straight pipe and drew water from the river surface, which contained a lot of sand. In Shandong, it was a horn-shaped water inlet with a flat cover. Water entered parallel from the surroundings, so there was less sand.

    (3) Movable joint - The 24-inch siphon pipe initially installed in Henan did not have a movable joint device, and the water inlet of the siphon pipe was often silted into the river and could not draw water. Later, with the introduction of the Luda Iron Factory in Shandong, a movable joint was developed, which could be used.

    (4) Air chamber - The air chamber on the peak of the siphon pipe is very easy to leak air. The air chamber installed in Wangjialihang had the glass tube installed on the outside, which leaked air easily, losing the function of the air chamber. The air chamber of the Weijiashan water intake station had the glass installed on the wall, which was better.

    (5) Silt field canal inlet gate - The silt field canal built next to the water diversion pool in Wangjialihang often had the gate silted up, making it very difficult to open. To this day, there is no cheaper and more perfect solution.

    (6) High canal - The high canal in Wangjialihang was built with sand and soil. It collapsed in several places during the initial water diversion. After repeated repairs and compaction, water was gradually released to hang silt, and it gradually stabilized.

    (7) Silt field method - The ideal silt field method is to first divide the field into blocks and build weirs. After the weirs are built, turbid water is released and clarified, and then the clear water is drained away. However, the silt field situation in Wangjialihang is very different. The weirs are first built in blocks, and then water inlet and drainage gates are opened at diagonal locations. Then, turbid water is released into the ground to let it flow freely. The silted land is the same level as the water surface, and the flowing water channel naturally becomes a silt field canal.

    In addition, a major failure is that in the past, the installation of siphon pipes along the Yellow River only resulted in the completion of the siphon pipes, water diversion pools, and main canals. Other branch canals, gates, etc. were not built. Even today, 20 years later, it is said that it is still the same and has not been expanded for irrigation. This proves two mistakes. (1) In the past, I paid more attention to the completion of the siphon pipe itself and less attention to the entire water conservancy project of the siphon pipe. (2) In the past, the government was separated from the people, and the people had no universal understanding of the siphon project. We must greatly correct the mistakes of the past under the leadership of the People's Government.

    When I was in Shandong, I studied the siphon irrigation area based on the Yellow River flow, water level, terrain inside the embankment, and the capacity of various drainage channels. Assuming that water is not drawn during floods, it is estimated that 22.4 million mu of farmland can be irrigated on both banks of the lower Yellow River. Taking 20 million mu as an example, 300 sets of 48-inch siphon pipes need to be installed, each set can irrigate 70,000 mu of farmland. According to the current price, the construction cost of each mu of paddy field is equivalent to 100 to 140 jin of millet. The construction cost of 20 million mu of paddy field requires a total of 2 billion to 2.8 billion jin of millet. The annual agricultural income can reach 2 billion jin. In the future, after the expansion and dredging of various drainage channels, the irrigation area can be increased by 10 million to 20 million mu during floods. After success, the annual income is equivalent to 3 billion to 4 billion jin of millet. Taking out 1 billion jin of millet every year to carry out other water conservancy projects will be infinitely beneficial. This is a very large water conservancy project.

    In the past 21 years, I have written several works on siphon pipes.

    1. Henan Water Conservancy Plan, published in 1929
    2. Shandong Yellow River Coast Siphon Silt Field Project Plan, published in 1934
    3. Hydraulic Situation and Flow Calculation of Siphon Pipes, Engineering Issue 10
    4. Suggestions on Continuing to Carry Out Siphon Silt Irrigation Projects along the Yellow River Coast in the Three Provinces of Henan, Hebei, and Shandong
    5. Suggestions on Developing Siphon Water Power Industry along the Yellow River Coast
    6. Yellow River Flood Area Water Diversion Project Design Book, with Design Drawings
    7. Siphon Water Intake Station Project Design Book, with Design Drawings

    These works are very superficial, and I am willing to put them in front of you, especially domestic and foreign water conservancy experts, and hope that you will criticize and correct them.

    In short, after more than 20 years of research and experimentation, I deeply know that the siphon pipe can solve the irrigation problem that has not been solved in the lower reaches of the Yellow River for thousands of years. As mentioned above, the siphon pipe has a simple, economical, and reliable structure. Each set of siphon pipes can be a separate project. More money can be spent to do more, and less money can be spent to do less. The siphon boat is very convenient for diverting water along the river for silt irrigation, and the conditions are better than culverts and gates. I hope that the government will, on the one hand, organize specialized institutions to carry out survey, measurement, design, construction, and other work, and on the other hand, widely publicize and mobilize the people to work together with plans and steps to expand the installation of siphon pipes. I believe that under the leadership of the People's Government, it will not be difficult to complete the 20 million mu paddy field plan in the lower reaches of the Yellow River within five years; in this way, the future of our country's economic construction will be very promising.

　　黄河下游虹吸淤灌工程
　　曹瑞芝
    “黄河下游虹吸淤灌工程”，比较普通灌溉工程稍微特殊一点，不妨先把题目略加解释：取一弯管来，一端插入高处水内一端置于低处地面，吸去管内空气，水自流出。此种作用叫做虹吸作用。利用此作用的管子叫做虹吸管，借着虹吸管引水的工程叫做虹吸工程。在黄河下游两岸引水有两种主要的用处。（一）淤淀沙咸地，（二）灌溉农田。所以把题目命为黄河下游虹吸淤灌工程。此项虹吸工程有其特殊之点，分四项说明：
    一、黄河为世界大河流之一，流量甚大。最小二百二十秒公方，最大约二万九千秒公方，可称水源丰富。
    二、黄河水内含泥沙之量甚多，此种泥水异常肥美，灌入田地，宜于作物之生长，可代肥料。
    三、黄河下游自河南荥泽渡口至山东利津河口长七百余公里。此段流域除山东寿张耿家山有四十五公里山地外，其余地方即为驰名之大平原。土质多为黄壤宜于耕种。
    四、黄河下游河槽，因历年淤淀，河床抬高，以致河内之水虽在冬季亦常高于堤内地面。通年由八公寸至三·五公尺利于引水。
    五、黄河右岸流域河南境内贾鲁河，惠济河，山东境内小清河，左岸流域河南省卫河山东省马颊河徒骇河均可作泄水河道。
    上述五种情形造成了广大的灌溉区域，实为世界上不可多得的天然资源。但数千年来黄河下游只受水患不见水利。每当黄河决口一次，生命财产损失无算，人称祸水，自古已然，于今为烈。所以当地居民只顾防害，何暇言利。
    瑞芝于一九二八年在河南省政府充水利工程师。奉命查勘黄河，意在兴办黄河水利。在查勘的时候我就想到利用虹吸原理在黄河大堤上安装铁管子引水灌田或有可能。因无十分把握，就在河南花园口大堤上架设四英寸铁管，先作试验，这管子是依着大堤断面形式弯曲的，一端插入黄河，一端置于堤内地面，两端都附截水门，管峰之上安装漏斗。开管时先闭两端截水门，将水灌满后关闭漏斗，再同时开启两端截水门，依法试验果然黄水射出，流之不已。又在开封柳园口试验一次亦得同样结果。当地老百姓看见黄河未开大堤即可引水灌田，欢喜异常，都认为从今以后黄河之水可以浇地了，当时即计划在黄河南岸架设二十四英寸虹吸管八组业已请示核准拨款购置，旋以时局转变，遂行停止。
    一九二九年瑞芝到山东建设厅充水利组技正，复继续进行此项工作。查勘至齐河县油坊赵庄，见黄河大堤之内筑有砌石闸门五孔。据当地人说，这是前清山东巡抚张曜建立的。目的在减水患兴水利，用意甚佳。但在将欲开堤引水的时候，群众起来拒绝动堤。环跪哀求，终未开成。于今该处闸门耸然排列，遗迹犹存。经此番调查，叫我看见了群众的心理认为黄河大堤是开不得的，开动大堤是最危险不过的。但具有科学知识的人，可不是这样看法，他们认为大堤之上开闸门建涵洞可能有方法使大堤不至出险。不过据我看来无论开闸门或建涵洞都不如安设虹吸管为最稳妥最适宜。兹述明理由如下：
    （一）虹吸管进水部分，有活节装置，可上下移动。用以灌田，则提高管口吸取河面之水，用以淤水潭或卑湿咸卤之地，则降下管口吸取河底泥沙。闸门涵洞无此优点。
    （二）虹吸管因为能吸取河面水的缘故，无论洪水枯水都可吸水灌田。若是涵洞或闸门枯水灌田与虹吸管无异但在洪水之际河底泥沙直入渠道淤淀甚烈殊不相宜，若设备引取河面之水，则水流过门跌落，损失水头甚巨，流量将大为减少。虹吸管有虹吸作用无此损失。
    （三）虹吸管基础工程容易施工，闸门涵洞比较困难。
    （四）虹吸管可装置船上沿河航行凡河水接近堤岸之处都可随时吸水淤灌，闸门涵洞为固定之建筑物不如虹吸管便利。
    （五）涵洞或闸门引黄水灌溉其挡水之门易被淤塞，虹吸管无此顾虑。
    从上列各项比较观察就看到安设虹吸管是黄河大堤上最好的引水方法，所以我在山东的时候深信虹吸必要成功，极力主张扩大安装以广灌溉，但一般人仍在怀疑，所以屡次计划建议省府屡次被驳，经过了多少波折直到一九三四年才在历城王家梨行及青城县马闸子各安装二十一英寸虹吸管一组，试验结果成效很大，曾记得马闸子一次洪水即将堤内低洼咸卤之地淤成良田六百亩，翌年种豆收获甚多。当时引起政府注意，遂在东阿魏家山安设三十六英寸虹吸管两组，每组吸水量三秒公方共可灌田十七万亩。原计划淤地之后并可使水泄入北运河接济航运。吸水站完工后试验吸水结果良好，山东省政府认为虹吸业已成功并拨款四十万元举办利津附近虹吸淤灌工程。当时又曾设计一虹吸船，系将虹吸管进水部分装置船上放入河中，其余各节管子可随时装卸于大堤之上，沿堤航行，以淤灌堤内之地。合同已订，未及兴工，七七事变爆发，遂行停止。冀鲁豫三省政府在事变以前，成立冀豫鲁虹吸工程勘查团，每省派工程师二人，瑞芝任团长，勘查完竣，正在收集资料，拟具报告，亦以事变告终。这些资料现存山东水利局李象震处，将来勘查虹吸工程可作参考。当山东王家梨行虹吸管成功之后，河南省政府在开封黑岗口将前计划之二十四英寸虹吸管安装四组，其效果尤著，黑岗口大水潭为黄河上著名的险工地点之一，现在业已淤平。开封城内饮水问题亦同时解决。惠济河两岸亦有水源可资灌溉。
    抗战胜利以后，一九四七年三月花园口堵口工程完成，黄泛区内，水过沙留，赤地千里，寸草不生。河南省政府建设厅，复兴黄泛区计划中，决定在花园口大堤之上安装虹吸管，引水淤灌，并济航运，瑞芝受该厅之托，从事设计。经数月之勘测设计，拟就黄泛区引水工程及虹吸汲水工程设计书图各一册。该项设计有两个特殊之点：
    （一）在花园口堵口上游附近安装五十八英寸虹吸管二十四组，出水量八十秒公方，用四十秒公方淤灌田地，四十秒公方接济航运。
    （二）利用入运之跌水发电一千开维爱（Ｋ.Ｖ.Ａ），并在上游左岸高地处建设虹吸汲水站利用电力灌溉高田十万市亩。
    第一项工程为目下黄河上最大之虹吸工程，引出水量可灌农田一百六十万市亩。第二项工程，证明虹吸引出之水可以发电，供给咸地、排水高地灌溉及农村工业之动力。在河南水头仅二公尺效用不算甚大，若在山东将虹吸引出之水再引至小清河，水头可能在四公尺以上，更可加倍的开发动力。
    在过去二十一年中曾经多次失败，却在这失败中得到经验不少，略述七种如下：
    （一）虹吸地点——一九二八年河南开封柳园口曾设吸水站安装离心吸水机三部。安装的时候，河水紧接吸水站，一九三一年，河身北移约二里，吸水站欲吸水还得开挖二里引水渠。年年挑淤不胜其烦，所以选择虹吸地点一定要选在河水永不离岸的地方。
    （二）进水口——河南虹吸管进水口为直管且吸取河面之水含沙甚多。山东则为喇叭式进水口，口门平盖。水由周围平行进入沙量较少。
    （三）活节——河南初次安装的二十四英寸虹吸管，没有活节设备，虹吸管进水口常常淤入河内不能引水。后由山东介绍陆大铁工厂成为活节才可应用。
    （四）空气室—虹吸管峰上的空气室，是非常容易透气的。王家梨行安装之空气室，玻璃管在外面装置，动不动就透气，丧失了空气室的作用。魏家山吸水站空气室将玻璃装于室壁上，比较好些。
    （五）淤田渠进水门—王家梨行在引水池傍边建立的淤田渠道，闸门常常淤塞，启门时大感困难，到如今还没有想下比较省钱的完善办法。
    （六）高渠——王家梨行高渠系用沙土筑成，初次引水崩溃数处。屡经修筑夯实逐渐放水挂淤，方才稳固。
    （七）淤田方法——理想上淤田方法是先将田地分块筑围堰，围堰筑好放浑水澄清之后，再将清水排去，但在王家梨行淤田情形大不相同，乃是先将围堰分块打好。在对角地点开进水泄水门。然后放浑水入地让其自由流行，淤成之地与水面相同，流水之槽自然成为淤田渠。
    此外还有一大失败就是过去在黄河沿岸安设虹吸管仅仅做成虹吸管，引水池和干渠，其他支渠闸门等都没有做。一直到今天已二十年了据说还是原样未曾扩大实施灌溉。这件事证明了两个错误。（一）是我自己在过去多注意到虹吸管本身之完成甚少注意到虹吸管整个的水利事业。（二）在过去政府与老百姓脱节，老百姓根本就没有家喻户晓的了解了虹吸工程。我们要在人民政府领导之下大大的纠正过去的错误。
    我在山东的时候曾根据黄河流量，水位堤内地形以及各泄水河道之容量等情形研究虹吸灌溉面积，假设洪水时期不吸水估计黄河下游两岸可能灌溉二千二百四十万市亩。以二千万市亩说，需要安装四十八英寸虹吸管三百组，每组可灌田七万市亩依目下物价估计，每亩水田建设费折合小米一百至一百四十市斤，二千万市亩水田建设费，共需小米二十至二十八亿市斤。而每年农产收入可达二十亿市斤。将来各泄水河道扩大疏浚以后，在洪水时期还可增加灌溉面积一千至二千万市亩。成功之后，每年收入折合小米三十至四十亿市斤。每年拿出十亿市斤举办其他水利工程其利无穷。这是一件很大的水利事业。
    在过去二十一年中曾写为了关于虹吸管的几种著作。
    一、河南省水利规划　一九二九年出版
    二、山东黄河沿岸虹吸淤田工程计划　一九三四年出版
    三、虹吸管之水力情形及流量之计算　工程十期
    四、继续兴办豫冀鲁三省黄河沿岸虹吸淤灌工程之建议
    五、发展黄河沿岸虹吸水力工业之建议
    六、黄泛区引水工程设计书　附设计图
    七、虹吸汲水站工程设计书　附设计图这些著作都是很浮浅的，我愿意摆在诸位特别是中外水利专家面前，希望大家多加批评予以纠正。
    总之，经二十余年的研究与实验深知黄河下游数千年来未曾解决的灌溉问题，虹吸管能把他解决了。如前所述虹吸管构造简单又经济又稳妥。每组虹吸管可单独成一工程，钱多多办，钱少少办。虹吸船沿河引水淤灌十分便利，比较涵洞闸门条件优良。希望政府一面组织专门机构，从事查勘，测量，设计，施工等工作，一面广事宣传，发动民众，群策群力，有计划，有步骤的扩大按装虹吸管，我相信在人民政府领导之下，五年之内，不难完成黄河下游两千万亩水田计划；这样，我国经济建设的前途当大有可观。
