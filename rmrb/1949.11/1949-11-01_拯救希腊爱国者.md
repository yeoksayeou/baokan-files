　　We, the people of the People's Republic of China, unanimously protest against the barbaric persecution of the leaders of the people of the United States and Australia by the reactionary governments of the United States and Australia. We also unanimously and strongly protest to the Athens royalist fascist regime against its barbaric death sentence against the leaders of the Greek people's revolution, and advocate the immediate restoration of the freedom of Greek patriots and leaders of the Greek Communist Party, Talagani, and others. The Chinese people fully support the statement of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on October 30, and at the same time, fully agree with the proposal of the Soviet delegation to the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly to save the Greek patriots, and firmly advocate the revocation of this illegal judgment!
    The Athens royalist fascist regime, which relies on bayonets to maintain its reactionary rule, is following the intentions of its American and British masters, intending to use dollars, red-hot irons, and mad massacres to eliminate the strength of the Greek people who once heroically resisted Nazi aggression, and to create a bulwark in the Balkans against the Soviet Union and the people for Wall Street! Since the British imperialist Scobie sent the Athens reactionaries back to Greece with warships and flamethrowers, during the three and a half years of the American imperialists spending money, guns, and manpower to participate in the massacre of the Greek people, their atrocities are countless, and the blood debts they owe to the Greek people are even incalculable.
    The bloody terror of the Athens bandits, like the atrocities of the American and Australian reactionary governments, as the statement of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China said: "It does not indicate the strength and stability of the reactionary forces of various countries, but shows their fear of their approaching death!" Yes, the Athens bandits have trembled in the face of the powerful Greek Democratic Army and the magnificent ranks of the Greek people's revolution! Even if the Athens royalist fascist bandits have tens of thousands of troops from their American and British masters to help them do evil, hundreds of millions of dollars, ammunition, materials, and thousands of military advisers, and even recently used the traitor Tito's false aid, they cannot shake the powerful Greek Democratic Army at all. Millions of Greek people are even glaring at the fascist bandits with hatred and anger, making the bandits dare not face the truth and dare not face the people! It openly sentenced patriotic democrats to death, and it had to secretly massacre patriotic people! Because it is cowardly! Because any Greek people understand that the reactionaries sell out the country and the people to imperialism, and they are the sinners of Greece!
    The shameful judgment of the Athens reactionary court against the patriotic Greek Communist leader Talagani and others has no basis, but only relies on the testimony of the police who have already "committed suicide," and even two of its five judges expressed opposition to this illegal judgment. The shameless act of the reactionaries imposing unwarranted charges on the patriots who resisted the Nazi movement will naturally arouse the anger of all justice-loving people in the world. We are comrades-in-arms fighting alongside the Greek people, and we will tell the Greek people struggling in suffering: with the progressive people of the world with you, you are by no means isolated. With the full support of the Soviet Union led by the great Stalin and the world democratic and peaceful camp led by the Soviet Union, we have the power to finally defeat the bloody atrocities of the Athens bandits and the reactionaries of various countries, and overthrow the reactionary rule of imperialism and its running dogs in various countries.
    The representatives of the American and British blocs have been defeated in the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly in discussing the issue of saving the Greek patriots because they are the spokespersons of the bandits. All their sophistry cannot stop the righteous and humane call of the Soviet delegation. The angry cries of the Greek democrats who broke through the iron windows from the Athens prison have merged with the proposal of the Soviet delegation, attracting the people of the world to more bravely embark on the road of the people's great revolution to overthrow imperialism and the reactionaries of various countries.
    The Athens bandits' crimes of torturing and killing patriots particularly aroused deep anger in us—the people of the People's Republic of China, who have just been liberated from the oppression of the American imperialists and their running dog Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang used all kinds of inhuman tortures to deal with our patriots! But as a result of our heroic struggle, the number one lackey of American imperialism in Asia has been completely overthrown by us, and its torture rule has come to an end forever. All reactionaries who want to maintain their regime by torturing patriots should take a look at the fate of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits as soon as possible! Yesterday, we just freed ourselves from torture and enslavement, and we will never forget the Greek people who are still under the torture and enslavement of American imperialist lackeys today! We guarantee that we will support you with all our strength, and we must stand with the Soviet Union and the progressive people of the world to fight for the overthrow of the rule of imperialist reactionaries, for the permanent liberation and happiness of the Greek people and the people of the world.

### 拯救希腊爱国者

　　拯救希腊爱国者
    我们中华人民共和国的人民，一致抗议美国和澳大利亚的反动政府对美澳两国人民领袖的野蛮迫害，我们同样一致向雅典保皇法西斯严重抗议其对希腊人民革命领袖野蛮的死刑判决，并主张立即恢复希腊爱国者希共领袖塔拉甘尼等人的自由。中国人民完全拥护中共中央十月三十日的声明，同时，也完全赞同苏联代表团在联大政委会上所提出的拯救希腊爱国者的建议，坚决主张撤消这一非法判决！
    靠着刺刀来维持反动统治的雅典保皇法西斯政权，正秉承其美英主子的意图，打算用美元、热铁和疯狂的屠杀来消灭曾经英勇抵抗纳粹侵略的希腊人民的力量，为华尔街造成一座巴尔干半岛上反苏反人民的堡垒！自英帝斯科比以军舰喷火机把雅典反动派送回希腊，至今日美帝出钱出枪出人参加屠杀希腊人民的三年半当中，它们的暴行，是擢发难数的，它们所欠下希腊人民的血债，更是无法计算的。
    雅典匪徒的血腥恐怖，和美澳反动政府的暴行一样，正如中共中央声明所说：“不是表示各国反动派势力的强大稳固，而是表示了它们对于自己临近死亡的恐惧！”是的，雅典匪徒们在强大的希腊民主军和壮阔的希腊人民革命行列面前已经战栗了！即使雅典保皇法西斯匪徒们有其美英主子上万的军队助纣为虐，有成亿万的美元、军火、物资和成千的军事顾问，甚至不久前还利用了叛徒铁托的假道援助，但它们丝毫不能摇撼强大的希腊民主军，千百万的希腊人民更加对法西斯匪徒张着仇恨和愤怒的眼睛，使匪徒们不敢正视真理，不敢面对人民！它公开地判处爱国民主分子以死刑，它还不得不偷偷地屠杀爱国人民！因为它胆怯！因为任何一个希腊人民都明白，反动派出卖国家和人民给帝国主义，它是希腊的罪人！
    雅典反动法庭对爱国者希共领袖塔拉甘尼等人的可耻判决，没有任何根据，而只是靠着已经“自杀”了的警察的口证，甚至它的五位法官中就有两位表示反对这种非法的判决。反动派以莫须有的罪名强加于抵抗纳粹运动的爱国者头上的这种无耻的行为，自然要激起全世界有正义感的人民的愤怒。我们是与希腊人民并肩作战的战友，我们将告诉在苦难中搏斗的希腊人民：有全世界进步人民和你们在一起，你们决不是孤立的。有以伟大的斯大林所领导的苏联和以苏联为领导的世界民主和平阵营的全力支持，我们便有力量最后战胜雅典匪徒们和各国反动派的血腥暴行，推翻帝国主义及其走狗在各国的反动统治。
    美英集团的代表们已因为它们是匪徒的代言人而在联大政委会讨论拯救希腊爱国者的问题上吃了败仗。它们的一切狡辩，都阻挡不住苏联代表团正义的人道呼声。从雅典监狱里冲破铁窗而出的希腊民主分子愤怒的呼号，已和苏联代表团的建议交溶在一起，招引着全世界的人民更加英勇地走上打倒帝国主义和各国反动派的人民大革命的道路。
    雅典匪徒酷刑残杀爱国者的罪行，对于我们——刚从美帝及其走狗蒋介石匪帮压迫下解放出来的中华人民共和国的人民，特别感到深深的愤怒。蒋介石匪帮曾以各种各样的惨无人道的酷刑对付我们的爱国者！但我们英勇搏斗的结果，美帝亚洲第一号大奴才已被我们根本打倒了，它的酷刑统治从此永远结束了。一切想用酷刑迫害爱国者以维持政权的反动派，都应及早地看一看蒋介石匪徒的下场！昨天，我们才从酷刑奴役下翻身，我们决忘不了今日仍处在美帝奴仆酷刑奴役下的希腊人民！我们保证将以全力支援你们，我们一定要和苏联及全世界进步人类在一起，为打倒帝国主义反动派的统治，为希腊人民和全世界人民的永久解放与幸福而坚持斗争。
