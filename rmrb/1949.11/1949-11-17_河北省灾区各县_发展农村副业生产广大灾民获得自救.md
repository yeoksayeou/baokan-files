　　Hebei Province Disaster-stricken Counties
　　Develop Rural Sideline Production, Vast Numbers of Disaster Victims Achieve Self-Salvation
　　[This newspaper dispatch] The production self-salvation movement in various disaster-stricken counties of Hebei Province has been widely launched. This year's floods in the province were relatively severe, causing disasters to 79 counties, over 27 million mu of land, and over 7 million people. To overcome this disaster, all localities have implemented the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party's policy of "in-depth mobilization, reliance on the masses, self-reliance, production for self-salvation, and long-term planning" for production and disaster relief, and have organized disaster victims for production in various aspects. For example, in the Tianjin Special Zone, disaster victims, under the leadership of the local Party committee and administrative office, are engaged in sideline production such as fishing, weaving mats, spinning, oil pressing, cotton ginning, transportation, and gathering firewood, as well as collecting alternative foods. According to incomplete statistics from Wen'an, Wuqing, Ninghe, and Jinghai counties at the end of September, the profits can solve the living expenses of more than 500,000 people and one month's living expenses for more than 130,000 people. In the Shijiazhuang Special Zone, Huolu and Jingxing counties contracted with the Shijiazhuang Railway Bureau to break stones. Jingxing contracted to break 10,000 cubic meters, and Huolu established a stone workers' cooperative, opening three stone quarries. The first stone quarry had 497 people participating, and in one month, they earned 100,000 jin of rice. The three stone quarries can accommodate 1,500 people, and if each person breaks one cubic meter per day, they can earn a wage of nine jin of rice. The Lingshou County Supply and Marketing Cooperative also arranged with the Shijiazhuang Sub-district and Zhengding shoe factories to supply more than 5,000 pairs of soles to the county each month (the Shijiazhuang Sub-district shoe factory pays a wage of two jin and four liang of millet per pair). Pao medicinal materials, transportation, and other activities are also widespread in Jianping and other counties. The widespread development of the production and disaster relief movement is mainly due to the vigorous organization and leadership of Party and government leading organs at all levels. Luo Yuchuan, Vice Chairman of the Provincial Government, personally went to the disaster areas of Anxin and Rongcheng to inspect the production and disaster relief work, giving great encouragement to the cadres and masses in the disaster areas. The Tianjin Prefectural Committee mobilized the entire Party to investigate the disaster situation and various sideline handicraft production conditions, and trained a large number of key personnel to organize disaster victims, both men and women, full and part-time laborers, to engage in various production activities. Local state-owned economic departments and cooperatives actively carried out business around production and disaster relief. For example, the Tianjin Branch of the People's Bank, according to incomplete statistics, has loaned more than 225 million yuan to farmers to support production. Local stores and cooperatives have adopted the method of supplying raw materials and purchasing finished products to ensure appropriate profits for disaster victims. For example, the Shengfang Supply and Marketing Cooperative established a fishing industry cooperative to promote the products of fishermen, providing great convenience to the fishermen. The Ninghe and Baodi county supply and marketing cooperatives went to Zhangjiakou, Xinglong, and other places to open up sales channels for native cloth and mats, and exchanged them for grain to supply the needs of disaster victims. In order to maintain the supply of raw materials for the mat makers in the county, Anxin Hongli Mat Store and the Supply and Marketing Cooperative sent capable cadres to Xin'an City and other places to plan to contract 1,000 mu of reed fields, and planned to purchase 88,000 large mats in the market this winter and next spring. However, there are still many problems that need to be solved. For example, some Party members and cadres have a mentality of waiting for relief and do not actively lead the masses to engage in production for self-salvation, or do not patiently persuade the masses to voluntarily organize themselves, but force the masses to engage in collective production. The sales of local cloth, mats, willow braids, vermicelli, and other products in some areas are not smooth. Some supply and marketing cooperatives only focus on the supply of daily necessities and neglect the supply of raw materials for sideline production and the promotion of finished products. In some villages with more severe disasters and no sideline production base, the masses have not yet been organized.

　　河北省灾区各县
  　发展农村副业生产广大灾民获得自救
    【本报讯】河北省灾区各县的生产自救运动已普遍开展。该省今年水灾较为严重，致使全省七十九县、二千七百余万亩土地、七百余万人民遭受灾难。为了克服此种灾难，各地均贯彻了中共河北省委关于生产救灾的“深入发动，依靠群众，自力更生，生产自救，长期打算”方针，从各方面组织了灾民生产。如天津专区灾民在地委、专署的领导下，从事捕鱼、织席、纺织、榨油、轧花、运输、打柴草等副业生产和采集代食品等，据文安、武清、宁河、静海等县九月底的不完全材料统计，获利可解决五十多万人的生活和十三万多人的一个月生活。石家庄专区获鹿、井陉两县向石家庄铁路局包砸石子，井陉包砸一万方，获鹿成立了石工合作社，开了三个石场，第一石场四百九十七人参加，一个月即得米十万斤，三个石场能容一千五百人，一天一人能砸一方，即可得工资米九斤。灵寿县供销社并向石家庄分区和正定的鞋厂说好每月供该县纳底五千多双（石家庄分区鞋厂每双工资二斤四两小米）。建屏等县刨药材、运输等也很普遍。生产救灾运动得以普遍开展，主要由于各级党、政领导机关的大力组织与领导。省府罗玉川副主席曾亲赴安新、容城灾区，视察生产救灾工作，给灾区干部、群众以莫大鼓舞。天津地委曾发动全党调查灾情与各种副业手工业生产条件，并大批训练培养骨干分子，组织灾民男女全半劳力，投入各种生产活动。各地国营经济部门与合作社，围绕生产救灾积极开展业务，如人民银行天津支行，据不完全统计，已贷给农民两亿二千五百余万元，扶植生产。各地商店合作社，采用了供给原料收购成品的办法，保证了灾民适当的利润。如胜芳供销社为推销渔民产品，建立了鱼业合作社，给渔民以极大的方便。宁河、宝坻两县供销社，到张家口、兴隆等地打开土布与席子的销路，换回粮食供给灾民需用。安新宏利席店和供销社为了保持该县席民原料供给，曾派得力干部赴新安市等地，计划包苇地一千亩，并于今冬明春在市场收买八万八千大个席。但也还有不少问题需要解决，如有些党员、干部存在着等待救济的思想，不积极领导群众生产自救，或不耐心说服群众自愿组织起来，而强迫群众集体生产等现象；有些地区的土布、席子、柳编、粉条等产品销路尚不畅达；有的供销社，只偏重于生活必需品的供给，忽视了对副业原料的供给和成品的推销；有些灾情较重而没有副业生产基础的村子，群众尚未组织起来等。
