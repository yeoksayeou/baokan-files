　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 20th—The plenary session of the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference was a busy one for all the representatives, lasting seven hours today. In the morning and afternoon sessions, Iranian trade union representative Ali Mahmoud Shad, Vietnamese trade union representative Liu Defu, Indian trade union representative Sherfanka, and Burmese trade union representative Aung Win successively reported on the trade union work in their respective countries. In their reports, the representatives cited abundant facts to expose the plunder and persecution of the working class and all the people of Eastern colonial countries by British, American, and French imperialism. These reports also pointed out that the working class and people of these colonial countries are waging heroic and unyielding glorious struggles to resist the bloody rule of imperialism. This struggle is intensifying day by day and heading towards victory.
    The reports of the trade union representatives from colonial countries received deep sympathy and support from all the representatives at the meeting. World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) Vice-President and Chairman of the Dutch Federation of Trade Unions, Broeksz, spoke at the morning session, expressing firm support for the just struggle of the Indonesian working class and all the people against American and Dutch imperialism. Another Vice-President of the WFTU, General Secretary of the French General Confederation of Labour (CGT), Le Leap, also spoke at the afternoon session, expressing firm support for the struggle of the Vietnamese people against the rule of French imperialist rulers. Broeksz said: The struggle of the working class worldwide is indivisible, especially for workers in colonies and in capitalist countries that directly rule colonies, who are subjected to the same enemy—the exploitation and oppression by a minority of capitalists. Le Leap said: The French CGT has consistently opposed colonial wars. The French working class will continue to strengthen their support for the national liberation movement of the Vietnamese people in the future. The speeches of Broeksz and Le Leap were welcomed and applauded by all the representatives. The Indonesian and Vietnamese trade union representatives expressed their gratitude to Broeksz, Le Leap, and the working classes of the Netherlands and France.
    Today's meeting was chaired by Adili Bish, the trade union representative of the Mongolian People's Republic. The meeting adopted the closing date of the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference proposed by WFTU General Secretary Saillant on behalf of the Presidium of the Congress. The conference will close on the afternoon of November 22.
