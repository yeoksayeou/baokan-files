Increase Grain Production and Prevent Spring Famine Next Year

    Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 13th. The Zhejiang Provincial People's Government, in view of the fact that various parts of the province suffered from floods in the summer and autumn this year, and the harvest of autumn crops has decreased, in order to effectively overcome the spring famine next year, issued instructions on winter cultivation on the 10th of this month, calling on all parts of the province to change the traditional habit of idle winter fields, seize the time, and carry out winter cultivation to increase grain production. The instructions stated: Governments at all levels should widely publicize and mobilize farmers to carry out winter cultivation, investigate and count the types and area of various winter crops, and effectively help farmers solve the difficulties in winter cultivation. Especially in areas with severe disasters and greater difficulties, they should change the pessimistic, disappointed, and passively waiting mood of farmers, and actively carry out winter cultivation. All localities should cultivate winter crops in a planned way according to local customs and existing conditions, including barley, wheat, naked barley, broad beans, peas, etc. At the same time, the planting of rapeseed and other winter vegetables, such as radishes, Chinese cabbage, mustard greens, etc., should be expanded. In addition, green manure crops, such as purple clover and alfalfa, should be planted. These crops can be eaten before flowering, and plowed into the soil after flowering, which is the best fertilizer and can increase the yield of late rice and cotton. The instructions called on all localities to seize the time and complete the winter cultivation tasks before the Little Cold solar term. In areas where farmers have been mobilized, efforts should be made to "plant winter crops in every household and have surplus grain in every household."

    浙省府指出大量播种冬季作物
    【新华社杭州十三日电】浙江省人民政府鉴于全省各地因今年夏秋两季遭受水灾，秋季作物收获量减少。为了有效地克服明年春荒，乃于本月十日发布冬季耕作指示，号召各地改变冬季田地休闲的传统习惯，抓紧时间，进行冬季耕作，以增产粮食。指示称：各级政府广泛宣传和动员农民进行冬季耕作，调查统计各种冬季作物种类、面积，切实有效地帮助农民解决冬季耕作中的困难。特别在灾情较重、困难较大的地区，应转变农民悲观失望和消极等待的情绪，积极开展冬季耕作。各地应根据乡土习惯和现有条件，有计划地耕种冬季作物，包括大麦、小麦、裸麦、蚕豆、豌豆等。同时，应扩大播种油菜和其他冬季蔬菜，如萝卜、白菜、芥菜等。此外，应种绿肥作物，如紫云英、苜蓿等，这些作物在开花前可供食用，开花后耕入土中，是最好的肥料，能增加下熟稻和棉花的产量。指示号召各地应抓紧时间，在小寒节令以前完成冬季耕作任务。在农民已发动地区，要争取做到“家家种冬作，户户有余粮”。
