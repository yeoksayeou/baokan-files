Title: Overcome Blindness in Business and Enforce Strict Accounting Systems in the Future

The cooperative warehouse currently has the following shortcomings: First, after cooperatives from various regions bring their payments to Tianjin and hand them over to the warehouse, the warehouse deposits the entire sum into the bank before purchasing goods. However, the interest earned does not go to the original payer but is considered income for the warehouse itself. According to August statistics, the warehouse earned 1,400,000 yuan from this interest alone. This has caused widespread dissatisfaction among cooperatives in various regions. As a result, many cooperatives now deposit funds directly into banks or even private businesses, reducing the warehouse's ability to fully utilize customer loans to circulate goods, which affects the normal development of operations. The warehouse is now discussing specific measures to correct this.

Second, the warehouse itself still has significant blindness in its operations, causing considerable losses. The reason is that the management, accounting, and storage departments of the warehouse are not sufficiently interconnected. For example, the management department does not know how much inventory the storage department has. Sometimes, the purchase of goods at low prices by various cooperatives has been agreed upon, but the inventory is insufficient. As a result, they can only buy goods at high prices in the market to make up for the shortfall. Therefore, the warehouse has paid about 300,000 yuan in compensation for this. In addition, the accounting department insists on adhering to the end-of-workday system, which is very inconvenient for customers who come to pick up goods or withdraw deposits at any time, and also affects the smooth development of operations.

In addition, the warehouse's accounting system is extremely lax, and the responsible cadres lack a sense of responsibility. For example, before August, the warehouse paid 1,574,000 yuan in freight for goods transported to Tianjin by thirteen cooperatives from various regions. At that time, the warehouse paid it all. However, the warehouse's accounting department did not notify the lenders to repay the funds. Now, three months later, the cooperatives have returned to their original locations one after another, and they are still unaware that they owe the warehouse freight. If this continues, the warehouse will suffer significant losses. This is a concrete manifestation of irresponsibility towards state-owned property. This has now attracted the warehouse's attention and is being corrected.

　　今后在业务上应克服盲目性严格会计制度
    合作货栈目前仍存如下缺点：首先各地社来津携带货款交与该栈后，该栈在未买货前整批存入银行；但行息不归原款人所有，而做为货栈本身的收入。据八月份统计该栈以此项获息即达一、四○○、○○○元。因此引起各地合作社之普遍不满。此后不少合作社直接存款于银行甚或私人商号。致减少了货栈充分利用客人贷款周转物资的可能，影响经营的正常开展。现该栈已商讨具体办法纠正中。
    其次，货栈本身业务上尚存在很大的盲目性，致造成很大的损失。其原因是该栈经营、会计、和保管各科互相连系不够，如经营科不知保管科库存量多少，有时代各社低价买货已妥，但库存数量不够，结果只得到市场高价买货以补其不足，因此该栈为此赔款计三十万元左右。此外会计上坚持下班制度，对随时来往客人取货或支存款项甚为不便，亦影响了业务的顺利开展。
    此外，该栈之会计制度极不严格，负责的干部责任心不够，如该栈在八月份前，有十三个各地合作社运津物资的运费计一、五七四、○○○元，当时由货栈一概付给；但货栈会计上亦不通知贷主还款，至今三个月来，各社已纷纷返回原地，且尚不知欠货栈运费一事。如是，货栈损失很大，这是对国营财产不负责任的具体表现，现已引起该栈注意，正在纠正中。
