Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 5th. The Chinese Labor Association Representative Meeting opened on the morning of the 5th in the auditorium of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions in Beijing. The purpose of the meeting is to discuss the ending of the Labor Association's organization and the tasks of the Labor Association members after the organization ends. Except for a portion of representatives who were unable to attend due to busy work, traffic obstruction, and a poor political environment, the vast majority of places with Labor Association organizations have representatives attending. There are a total of 42 official representatives and 8 observers. In addition, Li Lisan, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and leading comrades from various departments participated in the meeting.

The presidium of the meeting was composed of seven people: Zhu Xuefan, Liu Ningyi, Yi Lirong, Zhou Ying, Qi Juqing, Jiang Songling, and Gan Tian. On the first day of the meeting, Zhu Xuefan, Director of the Labor Association, delivered the opening speech, and Li Lisan, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, spoke. In his opening speech, Zhu Xuefan pointed out that the Labor Association had completed its historical mission, and the representatives from various regions unanimously agreed to end the Labor Association. After the Labor Association is dissolved, Labor Association comrades should join the organizations of various industrial trade unions in various regions, sincerely accept the leadership of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, humbly learn, and work together for the great unity of the Chinese working class, the great cause of building a new China, and the protection of the interests of the Chinese working class. In his speech, Li Lisan expressed his welcome to the policy proposed by Zhu Xuefan regarding the Labor Association. Li Lisan pointed out that in the past fourteen years, the Labor Association has made significant contributions to the unity and unification of the Chinese working class and the cause of national liberation, especially after the Jiaochangkou incident. The Labor Association resolutely opposed the various destructive activities of the Kuomintang reactionaries and the traitors within the Labor Association, writing a glorious record in the history of the workers' movement. Li Lisan said: Now the historical task of the Labor Association has been completed. In order to undertake new tasks, and in order to cooperate with the unified plan to develop production, the organizational form of the Labor Association is no longer suitable for the needs of the current situation. Therefore, the opinion to end the Labor Association is completely in line with the interests of the Chinese working class. Li Lisan called on cadres of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and various industrial and local trade unions to unite with all comrades of the Labor Association as one, and work together for the great construction cause of the new China.

　　讨论结束劳动协会工作
  　劳协代表会议开幕
    朱学范号召劳协会员参加工会李立三致词代表全总热烈欢迎
    【新华社北京五日电】中国劳动协会代表会议，已于五日上午在北京中华全国总工会大礼堂开幕。会议的目的是讨论结束劳动协会的组织和结束组织以后劳协会员的任务。这次会议除一部分代表因为工作繁忙，交通阻塞及政治环境恶劣未能来京出席外，绝大部分有劳协组织的地方都有代表出席。共到正式代表四十二人，列席代表八人。此外参加会议的有中华全国总工会李立三副主席和各部门主要负责同志。
    会议由朱学范、刘宁一、易礼容、周颖、齐巨卿、姜松龄、甘田等七人担任主席团。会议的第一日由劳协理事长朱学范致开幕词和全国总工会副主席李立三讲话。朱学范在开幕词中指出劳协已完成了它的历史任务，各地代表一致同意结束劳协，这次会议就是要讨论劳协的结束工作。在劳协结束后，劳协同志应参加各地各种产业工会的组织，诚心诚意接受全国总工会的领导，虚心学习，共同为中国工人阶级的大团结、建设新中国的伟大事业与保护中国工人阶级的利益而努力。李立三在讲话中对朱学范提出的关于劳协的方针表示欢迎。李立三指出：在过去的十四年当中，劳协在中国工人阶级的团结统一和全国人民解放事业中是有重大贡献的，特别在较场口事件以后，劳协坚决地反对了国民党反动派及劳协内部叛卖分子各种破坏活动，写下了工人运动史上的光荣纪录。李立三说：现在劳协的历史任务已经完成。为了负起新的任务，为了配合统一计划发展生产，劳协的组织形式已不适于目前形势的需要。因此，结束劳协的意见是完全符合中国工人阶级的利益的。李立三号召全国总工会及各产业各地方工会干部，与劳协全体同志团结得象一个人一样，共同为新中国的伟大建设事业而努力。
