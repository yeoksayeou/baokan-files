　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 17th: According to a Warsaw dispatch from the Polish Press Agency: The Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party issued a public communique on the 14th regarding the plenary session of the Party's Central Committee and the Central Control Commission. The communique stated: The plenary session was held from November 11th to 13th, with the participation of key activists. The agenda of the meeting included: (1) The Party's tasks in the struggle for revolutionary vigilance in the current situation. Comrade Bolesław Bierut, Chairman of the Central Committee, delivered a report. (2) Organizational matters.

　　The communique declared: "In the eleven months since the Unity Congress, Comrade Gomulka and Comrade Kliszko have neither shown any redress for the damage caused by their nationalistic deviations (which are desired by imperialism and its running dogs), nor have they demonstrated an effort to overcome these deviations through faithful Party self-criticism. Comrade Gomulka and Comrade Kliszko have not helped the Party to fully expose those hostile running dogs who have wormed their way into various positions. In view of this, the Central Committee hereby decides to remove Comrade Gomulka and Comrade Kliszko from the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party and deprive them of the right to participate in any leadership work of the Party.

　　"As recent revelations have proven, Comrade Spychalski displayed unforgivable political blindness during the enemy occupation and after the liberation of Poland due to a hypocritical, opportunistic, and nationalistic attitude. Moreover, this attitude made it possible for hostile elements who opposed the revolutionary movement and People's Poland and served the interests of foreign intelligence agencies to worm their way into responsible positions; Comrade Spychalski failed to help the Party expose these hostile elements in a timely manner. In view of the above, the Central Committee has decided to remove Comrade Spychalski from the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party and deprive him of the right to participate in any leadership work of the Party.

　　"The Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party unanimously decided to admit Comrade Konstantin Rokossovsky, Minister of National Defense of Poland, as a member of the Central Committee, and Comrades Granas, Jaszczunski, and Krajewski as alternate members of the Central Committee."

　　The communique concluded: "During the third day of debate at the plenary session of the Party's Central Committee, Maurice Thorez, a member of the Political Bureau of the French Communist Party, an outstanding leader of the French working class, and a meritorious figure in the international revolutionary movement, who is currently visiting Poland, attended the meeting. He was welcomed by the participants to the strains of the Internationale. Thorez delivered an enthusiastic speech, conveying the respect of the French working class."

　　哥穆尔卡及克利兹科民族主义偏向严重
    斯培查尔斯基犯机会主义使敌有机可乘
    波兰统一工人党决议将他们自中委会开除
    【新华社北京十七日电】据波兰通讯社华沙讯：波兰统一工人党中央委员会于十四日发表关于该党中央委员会与中央监察委员会举行全体会议的公报。公报称：全体会议于十一月十一至十三日举行，并有首要积极分子参加。会议议程有：（一）在目前情势下，党在为革命警惕而进行的斗争中的任务。由中央委员会主席贝鲁特同志作报告。（二）有关组织事项。
    公报宣称：“哥穆尔卡同志和克利兹科同志，自统一大会以来的十一个月中，既没有表示补救其由于民族主义偏向（这种偏向是帝国主义及其走狗所期望的）而招致的损害，又不曾表示用忠实的党的自我批评来克服这种偏向。哥穆尔卡同志和克利兹科同志不曾帮助党去完全揭露那些钻到各种不同的职位上去的敌意的走狗。有鉴于此，中央委员会兹特决定将哥穆尔卡同志和克利兹科同志从波兰统一工人党中央委员会除名，并剥夺其参加党任何领导工作的权利。
    “正如最近暴露的事实所证明的，斯培查尔斯基同志在敌人占领期间及在波兰解放之后，由于虚伪的、机会主义与民族主义的态度，而表现了不可宽恕的政治盲目性。而且，这种态度使得那些反对革命运动与人民波兰的、为外国谍报机关之利益服务的敌对分子有可能钻到负责任的职位上；斯培查尔斯基同志未能帮助党适时地揭露这些敌对分子。鉴于上述情况，中央委员会特决定将斯培查尔斯基同志从波兰统一工人党中央委员会除名，并剥夺其参加党任何领导工作的权利。
    “波兰统一工人党中央委员会一致决定以波兰国防部长康士坦丁·罗科索夫斯基同志为中央委员，以格拉纳斯、雅约辛斯基及克拉也夫斯基三同志为候补中央委员。”
    公报最后称：“在党中央委员会全体会议的第三天辩论中，现在访问波兰的法国共产党政治局委员、法国工人阶级的卓越领袖、国际革命运动的功勋人物加香莅会，在国际歌声中，他受到与会者的欢迎，加香发表热诚的演说，转达法国工人阶级的敬意。”
