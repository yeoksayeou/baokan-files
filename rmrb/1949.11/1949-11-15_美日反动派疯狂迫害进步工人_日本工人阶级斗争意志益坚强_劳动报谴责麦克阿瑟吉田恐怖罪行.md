Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 14th: The TASS news agency in Moscow reports: The Labor Daily wrote on the 12th that General MacArthur's attacks on the Japanese working class are intensifying daily. General MacArthur, Prime Minister Yoshida, and all American and Japanese reactionaries have long sought to outlaw the Japanese Communist Party because its activities are paralyzing the US imperialists' attempts to turn Japan into an arsenal and bridgehead in the Far East. The Communist Party mobilizes the Japanese working class to fight for their vital interests and against the exploitation of American and Japanese monopoly capitalists. The police terror used against the Communist Party and progressive trade unions is particularly vicious. Communists are being arrested in large numbers throughout Japan. In Tokyo, Osaka, and other cities, the police are searching the locations of Communist Party committees. The Japanese Communist Party's organ, Akahata, is a frequent target of police searches. The American occupation authorities and the Yoshida government are launching anti-communist hysteria nationwide. At the same time, MacArthur and the Yoshida government are calmly engaging in various terrorist activities of fascist "anti-communist alliances."

The American and Japanese reactionaries are very unhappy with some of the democratic rights and some improvements in their status that Japanese workers have won since the end of the war. American monopoly capitalists and their Japanese accomplices are trying to force workers back to the status of complete powerlessness they were in during Tojo's military-fascist dictatorship. In 1949, a significant portion of the Japanese working class suffered from long-term unemployment, hunger, and poverty. Even according to conservative estimates, the number of railway workers, postal workers, civil servants, etc., dismissed in the first ten months of this year reached 1.5 million. American and Japanese reactionaries have passed many anti-labor laws to weaken the position of the working class. Last year, 2.5 million civil servants were deprived of the right to strike and conclude collective contracts. In September 1949, they were deprived of the right to engage in any political activities, prohibited from joining political parties and groups, prohibited from publishing and distributing printed documents, prohibited from participating in election campaigns, prohibited from making speeches at demonstrations and rallies, etc. The new anti-labor measures almost completely copied the extremely reactionary American Taft-Hartley Act. In recent months, the American occupation authorities and the Yoshida government have banned many strikes: strikes by miners, metallurgical workers, tram workers, railway workers, and other workers. The general strike of railway workers held to protest mass layoffs was brutally suppressed by the police.

The newspaper emphasized that the American and Japanese reactionaries are especially vicious in persecuting the progressive trade union movement. They are by no means willing to accept that, of the seven million organized industrial workers and government employees, five million belong to trade unions led by communists and progressive leaders. This particularly angered the right-wing socialists, who have lost their original influence among the workers. The Labor Daily pointed out that the right-wing socialists, who are employed by American and Japanese monopoly capitalists as agents, have recently been actively engaged in splitting progressive trade unions.

Japanese and American reactionaries persecute progressive intellectuals. At the insistence of MacArthur's headquarters, thousands of professors and teachers have been driven out of all institutions of higher education and schools. After four years of attacks by the American authorities and their Japanese agents, unprecedented reactionary rule has become the typical situation in Japan today. The Labor Daily finally pointed out that the working class and the democratic public in Japan are actively fighting against reactionary tyranny, and the Japanese workers' will to fight is growing stronger.

    美日反动派疯狂迫害进步工人
    日本工人阶级斗争意志益坚强
    劳动报谴责麦克阿瑟吉田恐怖罪行
    【新华社北京十四日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：十二日劳动报写道，麦克阿瑟将军对日本工人阶级的进攻，正日益加剧。麦克阿瑟将军、吉田首相和所有美日反动派早就力图使日本共产党成为非法，因为它的活动瘫痪了美帝国主义把日本变成远东的军火库和桥头堡的企图。共产党动员日本工人阶级为他们的切身利益，为反对美日垄断资本家的剥削而斗争。用以对付共产党与各进步工会的警察恐怖，具有特别恶毒的性质。日本全国正在大批地逮捕共产党人。在东京、大阪及其它城市，警察搜查共产党委员会的所在地。日共机关报赤旗报是警察经常搜查的目标。美国占领当局与吉田政府正在全国范围掀起反共的歇斯底里。同时，麦克阿瑟与吉田政府又从容法西斯“反共联盟”的各种恐怖活动。
    美日反动派对于自战争结束以来日本工人所赢得的某些民主权利以及他们的地位的若干改善，很感不快。美国垄断资本家及其日本同伙，力图迫使工人们回复到东条的军事法西斯专政期间他们所处的毫无权利的地位。一九四九年间，日本工人阶级相当大部分都遭受到长期的失业、饥饿和贫困。即使根据保守的估计，今年十个月内被解雇的铁路职工、递信工人、公务员等的数目，也达一百五十万。美日反动派通过了许多反劳工法以削弱工人阶级的地位。去年有二百五十万公务员被剥夺了罢工和缔结集体合同的权利。一九四九年九月，他们被剥夺了从事任何政治活动的权利，不准参加政党和团体，不准发表和散发印出的文件，不准参加竞选运动，不准在示威游行和大会上发表演说等等。新的反劳工措施，几乎完全抄袭了美国极端反动的塔夫脱——哈特莱法案。美国占领当局与吉田政府，在最近数月来，禁止了许多次罢工：矿工、冶金工人、电车工人、铁路工人、及其他工人的罢工。为抗议大批解雇而举行的铁路工人总罢工，遭到警察的残酷镇压。
    该报强调称：美日反动派尤其凶狠地迫害进步的工会运动。他们绝不甘心于在七百万有组织的产业工人及政府机关员工中，有五百万人属于由共产党人和进步领袖们所领导的工会。这点尤其激怒了右翼社会党人，他们已在工人中丧失了他们原有的影响。劳动报指出：受美日垄断资本家们所雇用的代理人——右翼社会党人，最近积极从事分裂进步的工会。
    日本和美国的反动分子迫害进步的知识分子。在麦克阿瑟总部的坚持下，数以千计的教授和教员们被赶出了所有高等教育机关和学校。经过美国当局及其日本代理人四年来的进攻后，空前的反动统治已成为今天日本的典型情势。劳动报最后指出，日本国内的工人阶级和民主公众，积极地为反对反动专横的统治而斗争，日本工人斗争的意志日益加强。
