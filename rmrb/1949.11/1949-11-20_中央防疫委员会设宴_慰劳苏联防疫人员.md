　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 19th—The Central Anti-Epidemic Committee hosted a banquet tonight to comfort the Soviet medical experts and all Soviet anti-epidemic personnel who had just returned victoriously from the Chahar epidemic area. During the banquet, Dong Biwu, Chairman of the Central Anti-Epidemic Committee, Li Dequan, Vice Chairman, Dr. Rakson, a Soviet expert, and Maisky, the captain of the Soviet anti-epidemic team, all gave speeches. Dong Biwu and Li Dequan both pointed out in their speeches that after being invited by the Central Anti-Epidemic Committee to China, the Soviet anti-epidemic workers, disregarding the fatigue of the journey, immediately rushed to the epidemic area to carry out anti-epidemic work. This socialist work spirit is worthy of learning by every Chinese person. Dong Biwu particularly pointed out that since the outbreak of pneumonic plague in Chahar, the rapid and powerful assistance from the Soviet government and the Soviet people to China has been an important factor in quickly stopping the spread of the plague in Chahar. The Soviet experts, in their speeches, highly praised the efforts of the Chinese People's Government, the Chinese anti-epidemic personnel, and the Chinese people in the epidemic area in the anti-epidemic work. They also expressed their deep satisfaction with the close unity and close cooperation between the Chinese and Soviet anti-epidemic workers in their work.
