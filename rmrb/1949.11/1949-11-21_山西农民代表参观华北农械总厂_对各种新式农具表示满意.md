Shanxi Farmer Representatives Visit North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory
Expressing Satisfaction with Various New Agricultural Tools

[Reported by this newspaper] A delegation of one hundred and twenty-seven farmer representatives from Shanxi visited the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory on the 18th, where they were warmly welcomed by the factory's staff and workers. At eight o'clock in the morning, the farmer representatives arrived at the Agricultural Machinery General Factory by car. Factory personnel, who had been organized in advance, led them to visit the workshops and view various agricultural machines in groups. The representatives gathered around the machines, and couldn't help but touch them, repeatedly saying how good they were. Li Shunda, a famous labor hero from the former Taihang Liberated Area, said after visiting the workshops: "It's extremely precise. I didn't realize it took so many procedures to produce one machine." Liu Baocheng, a labor hero from Jincheng, said after seeing thousands of Liberation-style weeding hoes: "These things are very good. They can be used on both large and small plots of land. Make more of them!"

When the representatives visited the chaff cutter and seed selector, Zhang Dexiang, a fifty-six-year-old labor hero from Pingyao County, said: "Every year, selecting seeds wastes a lot of labor. Three or four people sift them back and forth, and they can't sift much in a day. This kind of machine can process 350 jin per hour. Buying one of these for our village would be enough." Wang Fuxing, a labor model from Qingyuan County, stayed around the chaff cutter, looking at it, touching it, and moving it around. He said, "At home, two of us can only cut two or three hundred jin of grass a day, but this thing can cut a thousand jin in an hour. It saves so much labor!" He also said that this thing was too heavy, and two or three people couldn't lift it. The four legs below should have four small wheels attached so that one person could push it.

The testing of various machines began. There was a fifteen-horsepower water pump, a grass cutter powered by two animals, Liberation-style weeding hoes, and single-blade and double-blade plows. These machines were the most welcomed by the farmer representatives. The labor heroes all scrambled to hold the plow handles. Xu Gengchun from Zhongyang held the plow and plowed a furrow, then touched the depth and width of the plowed soil, and said with a smile, "This is a good thing. It plows deep and thoroughly." When they first saw the Liberation-style weeding hoe, the representatives all thought the blades were too wide to be used. Later, after the workers explained that the width of the weeding hoe could be adjusted, the representatives smiled with satisfaction.

After the representatives visited the various agricultural machines, the Agricultural Machinery General Factory held a simple reception. Factory Director Sun Jinglu said in a brief speech: "You are our dear brothers, our honored guests, and our old comrades-in-arms who shared life and death in the War of Resistance Against Japan. All the staff and workers of our factory are very happy to welcome you. We hope you will not hesitate to offer your opinions, because we make machines for you, and the factory is for you." Farmer representative Wang Dengk delivered a reply, saying: "We are very happy, because we have personally seen the worker elders actively making agricultural machines for us, and these machines are all suitable for our needs. We are very grateful to the worker elders. At the same time, the worker comrades warmly welcomed us, and personally demonstrated the machines for us, afraid that we would not understand, and explained them to us step by step. We must go back and work hard to produce more grain, to repay this enthusiasm of all the worker elders." These moving scenes were captured by the camera. (Photos attached)

　　山西农民代表参观华北农械总厂
　　对各种新式农具表示满意
    【本报讯】山西农民代表参观团一行一百二十七人，于十八日参观华北农械总厂，受到该厂职工的热烈欢迎。早晨八时，农民代表团乘车到达了农械总厂，由该厂预先组织好的人员领导分组参观各工房、及各种各样的农业机器。代表们围在各机器旁边，情不自禁的摸着各种机器连声说好。原太行解放区著名劳动英雄李顺达，参观了各工作房后说：“精密极了，不知道出产一部机器，要费这么多手续。”晋城的劳动英雄刘宝成看到千百架解放式耘锄后说：“这些东西可好的很，不管大块小块地都能用，多造吧。”
    当代表们参观铡草机、选种机时，平遥县五十六岁的劳动英雄张德祥说：“每年选种耽误不知有多少工，三、四个人筛来筛去，一天筛不了多点，这种机器，一点钟就打三百五十斤，俺村里买这一架就足够用的了。”清源县劳动模范王福兴一直围绕在铡草机旁边，看来看去，动一动这里摸摸那里，他说：“我在家里两个人铡草一天才铡二、三百斤草，这个东西一点钟就铡一千斤，多节省人工。”他又说这种东西太重了，两三个人也抬不起来，下边四条腿要按四个小车轮，一个人就可推动了。
    各种机器的试验开始了，这里有十五匹马力的抽水机，有用两个牲口带动的割草机，解放式耘锄，及单把犁、双把犁，这些机器都是农民代表最欢迎的，劳动英雄们都争着要扶犁把，中阳徐根春扶着犁犁了一趟后，用手摸了摸犁的深浅及宽窄，笑嘻嘻的说：“这是个好东西，犁的深，犁的透。”开始看到解放式耘锄时，代表们都认为拢太宽了不能用，后来经过工人解释，说明这种耘锄能宽能窄，代表们满意得笑了。
    代表们参观各种农业机器后，农械总厂举行了简单的招待，厂长孙景鲁同志简短的致词中说：“你们是我们的亲弟兄，是我们的贵宾，又是我们过去抗日战争中同生死共患难的老战友，我们全厂职工都非常高兴的迎接你们，希望你们能不客气的提出意见，因为我们为你们而制造机器，工厂就是为你们而设的。”农民代表王登珂致答词说：“我们非常愉快，因为我们亲眼看到工人老大哥在积极的为我们制造农业机器，这些机器又都适合我们的需要，我们都非常感谢工人老大哥。同时工人同志们热烈的欢迎我们，又亲自试验给我们看，怕我们看不懂，又一点一点的解释给我们听，我们回去一定要好好生产，多生产粮食，来回答各位工人老大哥的这种热情。”这些动人的场面，都摄入了开麦拉的镜头。（附图片）
