　　Representative Bukhoumik, a delegate to the Peace Conference, read to the audience the draft resolutions of the conference, including a resolution protesting the Indian government's refusal to issue entry passports to the Soviet and Vietnamese delegations attending the conference. Bukhoumik said: "The Nehru government does not generally refuse foreigners to visit India. The Nehru government often invites and welcomes missions and delegations from imperialist countries such as the United States and Britain, but this government refuses to allow Soviet delegations to come to India because it fears the friendship and cooperation between the Indian working people and the Soviet people in the struggle for peace." The conference then put to a vote the resolution protesting the Indian government's refusal to issue entry passports to the Soviet and Vietnamese delegations. This resolution was approved by tens of thousands of raised hands, and many people shouted: "Long live the Soviet Union, defender of peace!" "We will never fight against the Soviet Union!" "Fight against war, fight for peace!"
　　Speeches by the conference delegates and Calcutta workers' representatives continued late into the night. Speakers expressed the determination of the Indian people to fight for peace, democracy, and the friendship of all peoples based on the unity and common interests of the working people. It was also announced at the meeting that on the evening of November 25, all twelve dormitories where the conference delegates were staying were suddenly searched by the police, and all delegates were subjected to body searches. The audience was extremely indignant when they heard this report.
　　[Report from this newspaper] At the All-India Peace Conference, which opened on the afternoon of the 24th of this month, Sairabel, a representative of the West Bengal Provincial Women's Self-Defense Committee, said at the conference: "We will never let our sons and husbands fight for the interests of American and British imperialism and their allies - the Indian bourgeoisie and landlords. We will never allow our people to fight against the Soviet Union. We warmly support the Soviet Union." Speaking about the Indian authorities' oppression of participants in the peace and democracy movement, Sairabel emphasized: "This policy of suppression is bound to fail. Prisons and suppression cannot stifle the people's desire for peace and democracy." Sairabel's speech was repeatedly interrupted by angry roars protesting oppression and cheers for the staunch fighters for peace and democracy.
　　Representatives of the Tamil people from Madras Province sang revolutionary folk songs: "We firmly support peace and people's democracy."
　　The first meeting of the conference was marked by an astonishingly high tide of emotion. The park where the meeting was held resounded with slogans: Long live Stalin! Long live the great, advanced, and invincible Soviet Union! Long live free People's Democratic China and its leader Mao Zedong! Long live the All-India Peace Conference!

　　抗议印政府拒发护照
  　阻挠苏联代表团来印
    出席和平大会的代表布霍乌米克向听众宣读大会草拟的决定，包括抗议印度政府对苏联和越南出席大会的代表团拒发入境护照的决议。布霍乌米克说：“尼赫鲁政府并不是普遍地拒绝外国人访印。尼赫鲁政府经常邀请和欢迎帝国主义国家——美国和英国来的使团与代表团，但这个政府却拒绝让苏联代表团来到印度，因为它害怕印度的劳动人民与苏维埃人民在争取和平的斗争中的友谊和合作”。大会于是将抗议印度政府拒绝给苏联和越南代表团签发入境护照的决议，提付表决。这个决议被成千成万只举起来的手所批准，许多人还高呼：“和平维护者的苏联万岁！”“我们永不对苏作战！”“为反对战争而斗争，为维护和平而斗争！”
    大会代表与加尔各答工人代表的演说，一直继续到深夜。发言的人表示了印度人民为和平、民主、为以劳动人民的团结与共同利益为基础的各国人民的友谊而斗争的决心。会上并宣布，在十一月二十五日晚，大会代表寄宿的十二个宿舍，全部遭到警察的突然搜查，各国代表都被全身搜索。听众听到这件事情的报告时极为激愤。
    【本报讯】本月二十四日下午揭幕之全印和平大会上，西孟加拉省妇女自卫委员会的代表赛拉贝尔在大会上说：“我们永远不会让我们的儿子和丈夫去为美英帝国主义及其同盟者——印度的资产阶级和地主的利益作战。我们永远不允许我们的人民对苏联作战。我们热烈地拥护苏联。”赛拉贝尔谈到印度当局对和平与民主运动的参加者的压迫时强调说：“这种镇压政策是一定会失败的。监狱和镇压不能窒息人民拥护和平与民主的愿望。”赛拉贝尔的演说一再地为抗议压迫的怒吼声以及向拥护和平民主的坚强战士的欢呼声所中断。
    马德拉斯省泰米尔人民的代表歌唱了革命的民歌：“我们坚决地拥护和平与人民的民主。”
    大会的第一次会议为惊人的高涨情绪所标志着。开会的公园里响彻口号声：斯大林万岁！伟大的先进的不可征服的苏联万岁！自由的人民民主中国及其领袖毛泽东万岁！全印和平大会万岁！
