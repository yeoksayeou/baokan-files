[Beijing News] The Beijing Municipal Epidemic Prevention Committee held its third standing committee meeting yesterday (3rd) afternoon. The meeting was presided over by Director Zhang Youyu. First, Zhang Wenqi, Deputy Director of the Epidemic Prevention Committee, reported on the epidemic situation in the city, stating: At 10:00 PM on the 2nd of this month, the intelligence division learned that Zhao Guoliang, a resident behind Xianong Market, had walked to Beijing from Zhangjiakou, traveling at night and resting during the day, without being quarantined. The Epidemic Prevention Committee immediately dispatched a doctor to examine him. Because the person had slight swelling of the lymph nodes, he has been sent to the Municipal Infectious Disease Hospital for isolation and treatment. In addition, there have been no other plague outbreaks in the city. After discussion, the meeting decided: (1) To establish a blockade line from Dongba Town in the western suburbs to Liulichu in the northern suburbs, and to establish quarantine stations and isolation facilities in the eastern and southern suburbs, Tongxian, Changxindian, Fengtai and other districts. (2) To convene a meeting of directors of urban and suburban sub-committees on the 4th to arrange cleaning and rat catching work, which will be officially launched on the 7th.
