　　Using Study to Promote Work
    Lushan Organizes County Cadres to Delve into Policies
  　Work Style Tends to Be More Meticulous After Learning
    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] Since the Lushan County, Shandong Province, held a county-wide meeting of Party member cadres in September, cadres in various localities have initially attached importance to study in the past two months, and their work style has greatly improved. In agricultural production in the county, the masses in most villages and some cadres have the idea that "production does not need leadership." At the county-wide meeting of Party member cadres, the county party committee raised questions such as "Does agricultural production need leadership? Why don't the masses want our leadership? How to lead?" for special study. During the discussion, some comrades believed: "It is the 'backwardness' of the masses. For example, organizing mutual aid teams or seed soaking work is obviously beneficial to them, but they will not do it, and we cannot use coercion. How can we do a good job?" Some comrades believed: "We have no way, our work is not thorough." After criticism and self-criticism, a heated discussion was launched, and it was found that the main reason for poor production leadership was that everyone ignored study and lacked deep research on the instructions of the higher authorities, and did not understand that correct leadership was built on the basis of correctly grasping policies. For example, some comrades think that not studying is the same, and they fought guerrillas for several years in the past, and they also fought without studying. Li Guirong from Fu Mountain District said: "The documents and newspapers from the higher authorities are all the same old stuff, what is there to learn." The district chief of Shanting District said: "I am busy all day long, where is the time to study."
    In response to the above-mentioned ideas, the county party committee made a detailed analysis and criticism, pointed out the seriousness of its damage to work, and emphasized that if we want to do a good job, we should first strengthen study, strictly implement the two-hour daily study system, study what we do, and oppose the backward idea of not wanting to study. The county party committee also used examples to educate everyone. For example, during a test, Zhang Jizhen from Chen Hao District actually answered the policy of protecting cattle as "Cattle can't speak, if you don't give it grass, it won't have any benefits." Duan Fengshan from Shanting District forgot what to say after saying two sentences at a mass meeting, asked the masses to wait, and he would think about it again, and as a result, the meeting broke up. The county party committee pointed out that these situations force us to work harder in studying, to recognize that without studying, we will not be able to work, cannot progress, and cannot lead the masses forward.
    After this meeting, there have been great changes in the past two months: (1) Everyone has paid more attention to study, implemented the study system, and constantly researched and improved the study methods. For example, in Beizhuang, Fu Mountain, Chen Hao, Shanting and other districts, they only read before, which did not arouse everyone's interest, and the harvest was very small; later, they adopted the method of combining reading and explanation with practical work discussion, which improved everyone's enthusiasm for learning. Some problems encountered in practical work can also be solved in the discussion, and everyone recognizes that study and work are inseparable. (2) The work is more thorough and meticulous than before. For example, after Shanting District dealt with the mistakes committed by Ding Jindou, the village chief of Chailin Village, in a timely manner, the masses in many villages went to the district cadres to talk and provide materials. The party branches of Ezi Mountain and other villages in Xuzhuang District also asked the district to send people to help organize. The masses in Beiguanzhuang, Chailin and other villages in Shanting District said: "The work in the district has changed now, and they are constantly talking to us."
    However, in the current study, there are still many shortcomings that need to be overcome: (1) Study is only implemented to the district, and many work bases cannot conduct study regularly. (2) In general, problems found cannot be solved in a timely manner, because they do not understand the policies well enough, they only know the importance of the policies, but cannot grasp and apply them well. (3) Some comrades are still not used to summarizing or will not summarize, and are not good at consulting with the masses. The county is studying how to correct the above shortcomings. The county party committee has now arranged study, stipulated the strict implementation of the study system, and emphasized that the district party committee personally leads and strengthens policy study.

### 用学习推动工作  麓水组织全县干部钻研政策　经过学习工作作风趋于细致

　　用学习推动工作
    麓水组织全县干部钻研政策
  　经过学习工作作风趋于细致
    【本报讯】山东麓水县自九月举行了全县党员干部大会后，两个月来，各地干部初步重视了学习，工作作风有了很大的提高。该县在农业生产中，大部村庄的群众及某些干部存在着“生产不用领导”的思想。县委在全县党员干部会议上提出“农业生产是否需要领导？群众不要我们领导的原因在那里？怎样领导？”等问题，作了专门的研究。在讨论中，有的同志认为：“是群众的‘落后’，象组织变工组或浸种工作，明明对他们有好处，可是他们就不去作，又不能强迫命令，怎样能作好呢？”有的同志则认为：“是我们没办法，工作不深入。”经过批评与自我批评，展开了热烈讨论，发现生产领导不好的主要原因，是在于大家忽视学习及对上级指示缺乏深刻的研究，不了解正确的领导是建筑在正确的掌握政策的基础之上的。例如有些同志认为不学习也是一样，过去打游击好几年，没学习也是一样打下去了。凫山区李桂荣说：“上级的文件，报纸，还不都是老一套，学什么。”山亭区区长说：“整天忙个不休，那里有空学习。”
    针对着以上各种思想，县委作了详细的分析批判，指出其对工作损害的严重性，并强调指出：我们如要搞好工作，首先应当加强学习，严格每日两小时的学习制度，作什么学什么，反对不愿学习的落后思想。县委并以实例教育大家，例如测验时陈郝区张继珍竟把护牛政策答成“牛不会说话，不给它草吃，就没利益”。山亭区段凤山在群众大会上讲话，讲了两句话就忘了，叫群众等着，他再想想，结果就散了会。县委指出，这些情形迫使我们必须加倍努力学习，要认清不学习就不会工作，不能进步，不能领导群众前进。
    经过了此次会议以后，近两个月来情况已有很大变化：（一）大家较重视了学习，执行了学习制度，并不断地研究改进了学习方法。如北庄、凫山、陈郝、山亭等区，以前光读，引不起大家的兴趣，收获很小；后采用了读和解释一定结合实际工作讨论的方法，即提高了大家的学习积极性。有些实际工作中碰到的问题，也能在讨论中得到解决，大家认识了学习与工作是分不开的。（二）工作比前深入细致。如山亭区及时地处理了柴林村长丁金斗所犯的错误后，不少村的群众即纷纷找区干部谈话供给材料。徐庄区峨子山等村支部也要求区里去人帮助整理。山亭区北官庄、柴林等村的群众说：“现在区里的工作变啦，不断找咱谈话啦。”
    但在目前学习中，也还有着不少急需克服的缺点：（一）学习只贯彻到区，而有好多工作基点还不能经常进行学习。（二）一般对发现的问题，还不能及时解决，因为对政策了解不够，光知政策的重要，而不能很好地掌握及运用。（三）有的同志还不习惯总结或不会总结，及不善于与群众商量。以上缺点，该县正研究纠正中。县委现又布置了学习，规定严格执行学习制度，并强调以分区委会亲自领导，加强政策学习。
