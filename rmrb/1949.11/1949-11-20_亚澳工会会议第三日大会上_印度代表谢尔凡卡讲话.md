Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 19th—Indian representative Shelvankar's speech at the third day of the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference. The full text is as follows:

　　Comrades! On behalf of the All India Trade Union Congress, the Indian working class, and the laboring people, I thank and congratulate the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the mass organization of the leaders of the People's Democratic China. On behalf of the urban and rural workers of India, I thank and congratulate the Chinese Communist Party, the party that, under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, inspired and organized your great victory.

　　It is because of your great victory that this historically significant conference is possible. Your great victory has opened the door of China to the representatives of our Asian and Australian countries, to the representatives of the Asian member republics of the Soviet Union, to the fraternal representatives of the Soviet working class, and to the leaders of the World Federation of Trade Unions. Your great victory has opened the door of the world to China.

　　Here, I must join you in celebrating the great October Socialist Revolution, which gave us the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong. Thanks to this great revolution and its achievements, the working class proudly manages affairs from Berlin to Beijing, adding strength and inspiration to the world's working class and all progressive mankind. As Comrade Saillant pointed out in his report yesterday, this conference held in the heart of the People's Democratic China is of extremely great significance not only to the Asian-Australian working class movement but also to the world's working class movement. The reasons for this are not difficult to understand.

　　First, this conference will provide the leadership of the World Federation of Trade Unions, the general staff headquarters of the world's working class, with the latest reports on the economic and political situation in Asian and Australian countries.

　　Second, this conference will enable all colonial and semi-colonial countries represented here to fully benefit from the rich experience and achievements of the heroic Chinese working class. In other words, this conference will enable us not only to understand how to fight for raising the living standards of the laboring people in our countries but also to simultaneously struggle and organize for the victory of our cause—the cause of peace, complete independence, people's democracy, and socialism.

　　To this end, I would like to assure the All India Trade Union Congress that our trade union workers will not only repeatedly read the speech of Comrade Liu Shaoqi, Honorary Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, but also study and grasp its clear and rich content.

　　Third, the leadership of the World Federation of Trade Unions envisions that this conference will produce a liaison bureau. Is there any doubt that this liaison bureau will be the general staff headquarters coordinating our firm march toward victory in Asian and Australian countries? I believe that we must unanimously, wholeheartedly, and seriously support the establishment of such a general staff headquarters in Asia and Australia.

　　Finally, this conference is bound to imbue the bonds of international solidarity between the laboring people and intellectuals of the East and West with flesh and blood, bonds aimed at strangling our common enemy, the imperialist warmongers headed by Washington.

　　Let us look at the leaders of the working class sitting in this conference hall. Comrade Saillant, Comrade Solovyov, Comrade Liu Shaoqi and Comrade Liu Ningyi, Comrade Alishev Besianov—the representative of Socialist Kazakhstan. Look at Comrade Subka from Czechoslovakia—a country with a well-developed nationalized heavy industry—the representatives of the Mongolian People's Republic and the Korean People's Republic, and the representatives of Asian and Australian countries. Look at Comrade Piñia from Cuba and Comrade Dailo from French West Africa—we are here, in this conference hall, seeing the bonds of international solidarity with flesh and blood.

　　This is the great significance and role of this conference. Undoubtedly, the conference will prove to be a milestone in the history of the working class movement not only in the East but also in the world.

　　I now turn to the other two issues that Comrade Saillant brought to our attention. He pointed out that the great strength of the World Federation of Trade Unions and the significance of this conference, which will enhance the strength of the World Federation of Trade Unions, have caused some degree of panic among the ranks of saboteurs of the American Federation of Labor and the British Trades Union Congress. After suffering a tragic failure in their attempt to establish an international organization of saboteurs, they seem to have decided to do some residual work in Asian countries. As you may already know, the AFL has recently established an office in India to train and develop a cadre of saboteurs. They have found a small group of die-hard disciples among the leaders of the so-called Socialist Party, headed by Narain. This party has also appealed to the British Trades Union Congress to set up an office in India! Well, these labor imperialists can get a few willing disciples from the "Socialists" (who are only distinguished by their corrupt strike-breaking activities). Nehru and Patel can also lend them a few cadres from their local spies and ruffians. But I stand on this podium to assure Comrade Saillant that they will never get the Indian working class, which, under the leadership of the All India Trade Union Congress, stands firmly under the banner of the World Federation of Trade Unions.

　　Comrade Louis Saillant mentioned in his report the post-war plans of the British and American imperialists to intensify the exploitation of the colonial world. In this regard, I tell you something that will interest you, that in Nehru's so-called "free India," almost fifty percent of our industry is directly owned by British imperialism. British imperialism controls an even larger percentage of our industrial economy through the Anglo-Indian joint ventures established during and after the war. In addition, British imperialism continues to stifle India's industrialization through its manipulation of India's huge sterling balances, which at the end of the war, were about one billion pounds.

　　In the post-war period, American imperialism proudly entered the arena with strength surpassing its British partners. Truman wants to invest no less than 500 million yuan in India. Of course, this is conditional, that the Nehru government must ruthlessly suppress the working-class struggle led by the All India Trade Union Congress, suppress the Communist Party of India, and that the Nehru government must make India participate in the Anglo-American bloc of imperialist warmongers and pursue a foreign policy against the world democratic front led by the great Soviet Union. Moreover, most of this loan seems to be used only to develop our agriculture, not our basic industries. How shameful is the obsequiousness of the Nehru government, which is willing to accept all these conditions!

　　Well, let Nehru accept whatever he wants, but the Indian democratic forces led by the All India Trade Union Congress and the Communist Party of India have fiercely condemned this great sell-off of our national interests and national sovereignty. I assure Comrade Saillant that our working class, shoulder to shoulder with the world democratic front led by the Soviet Union, and hand in hand with our comrades in People's Democratic China, will wash away this shameful stain on our motherland under the indomitable banner of the World Federation of Trade Unions.

　　Long live the great conference convened under the banner of the World Federation of Trade Unions in the heart of victorious China!

　　亚澳工会会议第三日大会上
  　印度代表谢尔凡卡讲话
    【新华社北京十九日电】印度代表谢尔凡卡在亚澳工会会议第三日大会上的讲话。全文如下：
    同志们！我代表全印职工大会，代表印度工人阶级和劳动人民，感谢和庆贺中华全国总工会，人民民主中国领导者的群众组织。我代表印度的城乡工人，感谢和庆贺中国共产党，这在毛泽东主席领导之下鼓舞和组织了你们的伟大胜利的政党。
    因为有了你们的伟大胜利，这个有历史意义的会议才有举行的可能。你们的伟大胜利，使中国的大门为我们亚洲和澳洲国家的代表、为苏联亚洲部分各加盟共和国的代表、为苏联工人阶级的兄弟代表、为世界工联的领导人而洞开。你们的伟大胜利，使世界的大门为中国洞开。
    在这里，我不能不和你们一道庆贺伟大的十月社会主义革命使我们有了中国共产党和毛泽东主席。由于这一伟大的革命及其成就，工人阶级骄傲地执掌着从柏林到北京的事务，并给世界工人阶级和整个进步人类增添了力量和鼓舞。正如赛扬同志昨天在他的报告中所指出的，这次在人民民主中国心脏举行的会议，不仅对亚澳工人阶级运动，而且对全世界的工人阶级运动都具有极重大的作用。其理由是不难了解的。
    第一、这次会议将使世界工人阶级的参谋总部——世界工联的领导机构得到关于亚澳各国经济与政治情况的最新报告。
    第二、这一会议将使在此间派有代表的一切殖民地与半殖民地国家能够从英勇的中国工人阶级的丰富经验和成就中得到充分的益处。换言之，这一会议将使我们能够不仅仅懂得如何为提高我们国家劳动人民的生活水准而斗争，而且懂得如何为了我们的事业——和平、完全独立、人民民主与社会主义的事业——的胜利而同时进行斗争和组织。
    为此，我愿代表全印职工大会保证：我们的工运工作者不仅要再三地阅读中华全国总工会名誉主席刘少奇同志的讲话，而且要研究和领会它的明确和丰富的内容。
    第三、世界工联领导机构设想，这次会议将产生联络局。而这一联络局将是调节我们在亚澳两洲国家向胜利坚决迈进的参谋总部，这点难道有任何怀疑吗？我认为，我们必须一致地、全心全意地与严肃地支持亚澳两洲这样一个参谋总部的设立。
    最后，这次会议势必赋予东方及西方劳动人民与知识分子间国际团结的纽带以血和肉，这个纽带旨在勒死我们共同敌人，即以华盛顿为首的帝国主义战争贩子。
    我们来看一看坐在会议厅这个地方的工人阶级的领袖。赛扬同志，索洛维耶夫同志，刘少奇同志和刘宁一同志，亚厉舍·别西阿诺夫同志——社会主义哈萨克斯坦的代表。看一看捷克斯洛伐克——一个有良好发展的国有化重工业之国家——的苏布卡同志，蒙古人民共和国和朝鲜人民共和国的代表们，亚洲和澳洲诸国的代表们。看一看古巴的皮尼亚同志，法属西非的达伊洛同志——我们就在这里，在这个会议厅看见了有血有肉的国际团结的纽带。
    这就是此次会议的伟大意义与作用。无可怀疑的，会议将证明不仅是东方而且是全世界工人阶级运动历史中的里程碑。
    我现在来谈赛扬同志提起我们注意的另两个问题。他指出：世界工联的伟大力量以及将增强世界工联力量的此次会议所具有的意义，已引起美国劳联与英国职工大会的破坏者队伍中某种程度的惊慌失措。他们曾企图建立一个破坏者的国际组织，在遭到悲惨的失败之后，似乎又已决定在亚洲各国作一点残余的工作。有如各位或许已经知道的，劳联最近已在印度设立了一个办事处，以便训练和发展破坏者干部。他们在以纳拉茵为首的所谓社会党的领袖中找到了一小撮死心塌地的门徒。这个党还向英国职工大会发出呼吁，要它在印度设立办事处呢！好吧，这些劳工——帝国主义者可以从“社会党人”（他们仅只是以其腐化的破坏罢工的活动而出众的）中得到几名心甘情愿的门徒。尼赫鲁与巴特尔也可以从他们本地的间谍与流氓中借给他几名干部。但是我站在这个讲台上向赛扬同志保证：他们绝得不到印度工人阶级，印度工人阶级在全印职工大会的领导下，坚定地站在世界工联的旗帜下。
    路易·赛扬同志在他的报告中提到英美帝国主义者加紧剥削殖民地世界的战后计划。在这方面，我告诉同志们一件会使你们感到兴趣的事，这就是尼赫鲁所谓的“自由印度”，我们工业的几乎百分之五十，直接为英帝国主义所拥有。英帝国主义通过战时和战后设立的英印联合公司，控制了我们工业经济的甚至更大的百分比。此外，英帝国主义还通过它对于印度巨额英镑结余的操纵，继续窒息印度的工业化；而这笔英镑结余在战争结束时，约为十亿英镑。
    战后时期，美帝国主义挟着超越其英国伙伴的优势力量骄傲地进入角逐场。杜鲁门要在印度作不下于五亿元的投资。当然，这是有条件的，即尼赫鲁政府要无情地镇压全印职工大会所领导的工人阶级斗争，要镇压印度共产党，尼赫鲁政府要使印度参加帝国主义战争贩子的英美集团，并奉行反对以伟大苏联为首的世界民主阵线的外交政策。尤有进者，这笔贷款的大部分似乎必须仅仅用来发展我们的农业，而不是我们的基本工业。甘心乐意接受这一切条件的尼赫鲁政府的奴颜婢膝真可耻啊！
    好吧，尼赫鲁愿意接受什么就接受什么吧，但是全印职工大会与印度共产党所领导的印度民主力量已猛烈地斥责这种对于我们国家利益与国家主权的大拍卖。我向赛扬同志保证，我们的工人阶级将与苏联所领导的世界民主阵线肩并肩地，和人民民主中国的我们的同志们手携手地，在世界工联的不屈不挠的旗帜之下，洗雪我们祖国的这一可耻的污点。
    我们在世界工联的旗帜下在胜利的中国的心脏召开的伟大会议万岁！
