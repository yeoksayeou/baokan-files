The Significance of the Record-Breaking Movement

　　Politically Consolidating the People's Democratic Dictatorship, Economically Promoting a Surge in Production and Construction, and Culturally Enhancing Scientific Management Technology

　　Secondly, Comrade Fu Chun analyzed the economic and political situation in the Northeast and the whole country, pointing out that if all our factories and mines could launch a record-breaking movement, raising the existing production quotas and the levels of all aspects of production, and creating new records exceeding the old levels in all aspects, then the industry in the Northeast would take a big step forward. This would prove with facts that the Chinese working class is not only capable of leading the people of the whole country to overthrow the reactionary rule of China, but also has the power to engage in the construction of a new China for the people, and powerfully promote the industrialization process of China. Therefore, the record-breaking movement is also a concrete way to rapidly develop the economy, organize workers, staff, and technicians to support the Central People's Government from actual labor production, and thus consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship.

　　Thirdly, Comrade Fu Chun analyzed the issue of factory management, pointing out that we have proposed the policy of enterprise management and democratic management for more than a year, but it has not been fully implemented. The record-breaking movement proposed today is the key to combining and implementing these two policies. By increasing output and quality through the record-breaking movement, implementing quota management and cost accounting, and improving production and management systems, we will lay the foundation for enterprise management. To carry out the record-breaking movement, it is necessary to implement democratic management, otherwise, it will not be possible to mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of the vast number of workers, staff, and technicians, and it will not be possible to rely on the working class to improve production. Therefore, the record-breaking movement must also be a mass democratic movement, a concrete way to implement and combine enterprise management and democratic management.

　　Finally, Comrade Fu Chun elaborated on the two issues of cadre ideology and work style and production planning. He pointed out that Comrade Gao Gang called on our cadres to give play to their initiative and creativity, to have ideas, abilities, and vigor. Only by throwing themselves into the record-breaking movement, breaking conservative viewpoints, breaking old shackles, abandoning bureaucracy, and combining with the strength and wisdom of the masses can the cadres in factories and mines constantly study and summarize new experiences, make the appearance of production new, and conscientiously organize and lead the movement to create new records. Then they can greatly improve themselves politically, ideologically, and professionally, especially in mastering their business. Secondly, he pointed out that the characteristic of our economy is planning. We have made plans in the past, but they were very imperfect. To further improve the plan, we need an economic accounting system, quota management, and cost accounting. The record-breaking movement can enable us to implement quota management more appropriately in today's situation, and thereby improve our production plan. It can also better combine the production plan with the supply and sales distribution of raw materials!

　　Finally, Comrade Fu Chun pointed out the combination of the new record movement and the vital interests of the workers: The improvement of workers' lives and the improvement of workers' welfare can only be solved in the continuous development of production. When the new record movement is launched, we must implement a reward system, and we must also improve the existing wage system so that those who work more and work better will receive more honor and wages, and the living standards of all the people and the collective welfare facilities will be gradually improved with the development and improvement of production!

　　In conclusion, Comrade Fu Chun summarized: This record-breaking movement, in political significance, is to consolidate the material basis of the people's democratic dictatorship and promote the great power of the working class to build. In economic significance, it is to improve production and construction by one step and begin to enter a climax of economic construction. In cultural significance, it is to improve the scientific management technology of all employees by one step. We must use facts to prove the superiority of the new democratic economy over the capitalist economy, so we must seize the opportunity to carry out this movement well and fully.

  　创纪录运动意义
  　政治上巩固了人民民主专政经济上推进了生产建设高潮文化上提高了科学管理技术
    其次，富春同志分析了东北与全国的经济政治情况，指出如果我们所有工厂矿山，都能开展创纪录运动，将现有生产定额及有关生产各方面的水平都提高一步，并在各方面创造出超过旧有水平的新纪录，则东北的工业将大大向前发展一步。这就以事实证明中国工人阶级不但能领导全国人民推翻中国的反动统治，而且更有力量来从事建设人民的新中国，有力的推动中国的工业化过程。因此，创纪录运动又是迅速发展经济，组织工人、职员与技术人员从实际的劳动生产中，来拥护中央人民政府，也就是如何巩固人民民主专政的一个具体道路。
    再次，富春同志就工厂管理问题加以分析，指出我们提出生产企业化与管理民主化方针已经一年多了，但是还没有完全贯彻，今天提出的创纪录运动，就是结合与贯彻这两个方针的关键。通过创纪录运动，提高产量质量，实行定额管理与成本计算，改善生产与管理制度，这就给生产企业化奠下了基础。而要开展创纪录运动，又非实行管理民主化不可，否则就不能发动广大工人、职员与技术人员的积极性与创造性，就不能依靠工人阶级把生产搞好。因此创纪录运动又必须是一个广大群众的民主运动。是贯彻与结合生产企业化与管理民主化的具体道路。
    最后，富春同志就干部思想作风与生产计划性两问题加以阐述，他指出：高岗同志号召我们干部要发挥积极性创造性，要有思想、有能力、有朝气，工矿中的干部，只有投到创纪录运动中去，打破保守观点，打破旧的束缚，抛弃官僚主义，与群众的力量和智慧结合起来，经常研究与总结新的经验，使生产面貌一新，认真的去组织与领导创造新纪录运动，那么自己也就能在政治上、思想上、业务上大大提高一步，特别是使自己在掌握业务上提高一步。其次，他指出：我们经济的特点，就是计划性，我们过去订计划，但很不完备。计划要进一步搞好，就需要有经济核算制，有定额管理与成本核算。而创纪录运动，就能使我们在今天的情况下，比较恰当的实行定额管理，并从而改善我们的生产计划。并可使生产计划与原材料的供给和销售分配更好的结合起来！
    最后富春同志指出新纪录运动与工人切身利益的结合：工人生活的改善、工人福利的提高，只有在生产不断的发展中才能解决。新纪录运动开展，我们必须实行奖励制，也必须改进现有的工资制，使劳动得多的，劳动得好的，得到更多的荣誉与工资，而且全体人民的生活水平以及集体福利的设备，也将随着生产的发展与提高而逐步改善！
    在结论中，富春同志总括的指出道：这次开展创纪录运动，在政治意义上是巩固人民民主专政的物质基础，发扬工人阶级建设的伟大力量，在经济意义上，是把生产建设提高一步，开始走入经济建设高潮。在文化意义上是使全体员工的科学管理技术提高一步。我们要用事实证明新民主主义的经济比资本主义经济的优越性，因此一定要抓紧把这一运动搞好，搞的十分饱满。
