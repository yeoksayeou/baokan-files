Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 29th: The million citizens of Chongqing, who have long suffered under the oppression of the Kuomintang bandit gang, are eagerly awaiting liberation. According to an Associated Press dispatch from the 24th, "The majority of Chongqing's one million inhabitants are calmly waiting... They go on working and amusing themselves as usual, in sharp contrast to the haste and panic of those who are leaving." Bandit chieftains Yan Xishan, Zhang Qun, Chen Lifu and others fled to Chengdu on the 28th. According to a Chongqing newspaper dispatch, the desperate situation of the remnant bandits scrambling for their lives is "a scene of congestion and chaos." The remnant bandits remaining in Chongqing are living in fear. Since the 27th, the Chongqing Bandit Garrison Headquarters has announced the implementation of martial law, advancing the curfew to 7:00 PM to 6:00 AM the following morning, cutting off all traffic in the city and prohibiting passage. Chongqing's business community has been bankrupted by the remnant bandits' "silver dollar coupons" and various exorbitant taxes. In the week ending the 25th, seventy-five cotton businesses, fifty-six department stores, and eleven silver jewelry stores ceased operations. Chongqing citizens are scrambling to exchange "silver dollar coupons" issued by the Kuomintang remnant bandits for silver dollars, and the remnant bandits have moved the exchange location from the city to Shiqiaopu, forty miles away from the city.

　　重庆残匪争相逃命
  　百万市民渴待解放
    【新华社北京二十九日电】久处国民党匪帮压榨下的重庆百万市民正在渴待解放。据美联社二十四日电称：“重庆百余万人口中的大多数正泰然地等待着……他们照常工作着和娱乐着，与那些正在离开的人的急迫与慌忙，正成鲜明的对照。”匪首阎锡山、张群、陈立夫等已于二十八日逃往成都。残匪争相逃命的狼狈情形，据重庆某报电称：“真是一片拥挤，一片纷乱。”留渝的残匪则惶惶不可终日。自二十七日起，渝匪卫戍司令部已宣布实施戒严，时间提早到每晚七时至翌晨六时，市内一切交通断绝，禁止通行。渝市工商界已因残匪的“银元券”及各种苛捐杂税，而纷纷破产。至二十五日止的一周内有七十五家棉花业、五十六家百货店、十一家银楼业停止营业。重庆市民争以国民党残匪发行的“银元券”兑换银元，残匪则将兑换地点由城内移至离城四十里的石桥铺。
