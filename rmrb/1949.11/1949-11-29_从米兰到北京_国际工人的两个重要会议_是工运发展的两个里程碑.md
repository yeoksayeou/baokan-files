　　From Milan to Beijing
    International Workers' Two Important Conferences Are Two Milestones in the Development of the Labor Movement
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 27th] TASS, Moscow, 26th: The Labor News published an article by Timenjiev entitled "Milan-Beijing," commenting on the new developments in the international working class movement. The author pointed out that the working results of the Second Congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions and the important significance of the Beijing Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference are two extraordinary milestones in this new development. The resolutions of the Milan Congress unanimously demanded to consolidate the unity of the international working class in the struggle for the rights of the working class. These resolutions have been gradually implemented. The success achieved in the struggle of the proletarian united front in France, Italy and other countries proves this. Timenjiev further wrote: "The Beijing Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference, conducted in an atmosphere of boundless enthusiasm, has made great contributions to the worldwide struggle for peace. This conference promoted the consolidation of the unity of the international working class and also promoted the success of the liberation struggle of the oppressed people of the East against imperialist aggression and war-mongers. In the period from the Milan Congress to the Beijing Representative Conference, the arrangement of forces on the international stage has undergone significant changes."

　　从米兰到北京
    国际工人的两个重要会议  是工运发展的两个里程碑
    【新华社北京二十七日电】塔斯社莫斯科二十六日讯：劳动报刊载了季门捷耶夫以“米兰—北京”为题的专文，评论国际工人阶级运动的新发展。作者指出：世界工会联合会第二届代表大会的工作成果和北京亚澳工会会议的重要意义，就是这一新发展的两个非凡的里程碑。米兰代表大会的各项决议，一致要求在进行争取工人阶级的权利的斗争中来巩固国际工人阶级的团结。这些决议已在逐步实现。在法国、意大利及其它国家内所进行的无产阶级联合阵线的斗争中所获得的成功，就证明了这一点。季门捷耶夫进一步写道：“在无限热情的气氛中进行的北京亚澳工会会议，对全世界争取和平的斗争实有莫大的贡献。这次会议促进了国际工人阶级团结的巩固，也促进了东方各被压迫民族的人民反对帝国主义侵略、反对战争贩子的解放斗争的成功。从米兰代表大会到北京代表会议这一个时期中间，国际舞台上力量的排列，已发生了重要的改变。”
