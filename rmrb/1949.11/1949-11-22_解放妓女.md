　　Liberating Prostitutes
　　The second session of the Beijing People's Representative Conference passed a resolution yesterday (the 21st) to close brothels and the Municipal People's Government immediately issued an order to implement it. This is an important measure to abolish the reactionary and dark prostitution system and liberate women.
　　Article 6 of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference stipulates: "The People's Republic of China abolishes the feudal system that shackles women. Women have equal rights with men in all aspects of political, economic, cultural, educational, and social life." Brothels are the most backward and barbaric system that shackles, oppresses, and tramples on women. According to the principles stipulated in the Common Program, they must be resolutely abolished.
　　In the past, due to the rule and exploitation of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, many women were driven by severe living conditions or were abducted and victimized by hooligans and became prostitutes. They suffered all kinds of oppression from brothel owners, madams, and usurers, living inhuman lives. The existence of prostitution has also led to the spread of venereal diseases, poisoning the health of the people. Therefore, the resolution on closing brothels passed by the second session of the Beijing People's Representative Conference is of great benefit to the prostitutes themselves and to the entire society.
　　The crimes of brothel owners, pimps, and madams in the past should be accounted for. Among them, there are well-known bullies, criminals who abduct and sell people or force them into prostitution, and those who have committed serious crimes of murder. These are all intolerable under the laws of the People's Government. For those with serious crimes, the government should accept the accusations of prostitutes and punish them according to law, but for those with minor offenses who are willing to repent, they should be allowed to confess their crimes and given a way to start anew. All brothel properties accumulated by brothel owners, pimps, and madams by trading and exploiting prostitutes should be confiscated. These properties are actually entirely exchanged for the prostitutes' selling of their bodies and souls and should be used for the expenses of liberating the prostitutes.
　　All the prostitutes in Beijing are now liberated! We should welcome them to jump out of the fire pit from now on and get rid of their inhuman lives. Now the Municipal People's Government has begun to concentrate the prostitutes, first treating their diseases, and then, according to their specific circumstances, sending those who have homes to return to their homes, letting those who have partners marry, and helping those who have no homes or no marriage partners to learn crafts and participate in production so that they can live independently and gradually establish themselves and start a family. From now on, in the people's capital, brothels will disappear, prostitutes will be liberated, and the system of dark enslavement of women for two or three thousand years will be overthrown in Beijing! This is a social reform work of historical significance. We celebrate the complete success of this reform.

　　解放妓女
    北京市第二届各界人民代表会议，于昨（廿一）日通过了封闭妓院的决议，并即由市人民政府下令开始执行。这是废除反动黑暗的娼妓制度、解放妇女的一项重要措施。
    中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领第六条规定：“中华人民共和国废除束缚妇女的封建制度。妇女在政治的、经济的、文化教育的、社会的生活各方面，均有与男子平等的权利。”而妓院则是束缚、压榨与蹂躏妇女的最落后、最野蛮的制度，依据共同纲领所规定的原则，是必须坚决加以废除的。
    过去，由于帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的统治与剥削，有许多妇女受着严重的生活驱迫或被恶棍流氓分子所拐骗与陷害而沦为娼妓，她们饱受妓院老板、领家和高利贷者的百般压迫，过着非人的生活。由于娼妓的存在，又使性病流行，毒害国民健康。因此，北京市第二届各界代表会议所通过的关于封闭妓院的决议，对于妓女本身和对于全社会，都有莫大的利益。
    妓院的老板、鸨儿、领家们过去的罪恶是应该被清算的。他们当中，有著名的恶霸，有拐卖人口或逼良为娼的凶犯，有曾经犯了杀害人命的大罪的，这些都是人民政府的法律所不能容许的。对于罪恶重大的分子，政府应接受妓女的控告，依法惩处，但对于情节较轻愿意悔改的分子，则应允许他们坦白认罪，给以自新之路。所有妓院的老板、鸨儿、领家们依靠买卖与剥削妓女而积累起来的妓院财产，应该予以没收。这些财产实际上完全是妓女出卖肉体与灵魂所换来的，应该用作妓女解放的经费。
    北京市所有的妓女，现在是得到解放了！我们应该欢迎她们从此跳出火坑，从此摆脱非人的生活。现在市人民政府已经开始集中妓女，将首先医治她们的疾病，然后分别根据她们的具体情况，有家可归的送她们回家，有对象的让她们结婚，无家可归或无结婚对象者帮助她们学习工艺，参加生产，使她们能够独立地生活，并且逐渐成家立业。从此，在人民的首都，妓院绝迹，妓女解放，两三千年来对妇女的黑暗奴役的制度在北京被打倒了！这是具有历史意义的一项社会改革工作。我们庆祝这一改革的完满成功。
