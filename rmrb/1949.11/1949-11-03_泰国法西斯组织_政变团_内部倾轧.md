Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 2nd: According to a Reuters dispatch quoting Bangkok newspapers of October 27th, internal divisions and strife have erupted within the "Coup Clique," the fascist military group of the Thai Luang Phibunsongkhram government. Sources say that Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Luang Kat, distributed a confidential booklet to all members of the "Coup Clique," warning that internal personal conflicts are reaching an "explosion point." In the booklet, Luang Kat pointed out that mutual suspicion and corruption exist within the clique and have reached such a degree that members are divided into factions engaging in mutual recrimination and killing.

　　　　　　
Note: The Thai "Coup Clique" is a fascist military group that launched the "coup" in November 1947. Headed by the current Prime Minister of Thailand, Luang Phibunsongkhram, and with the army, thugs, and secret agents as its backbone, the group represents the forces of the Thai aristocracy, landlords, and a section of the comprador bourgeoisie. Luang Kat was one of the key leaders of the 1947 "coup," but now tends to side with the royal faction headed by Nai Khuan within the Thai ruling group, and is engaged in fierce infighting with Luang Phibunsongkhram's direct line of the Coup Clique.

　　泰国法西斯组织“政变团”内部倾轧
    【新华社北京二日电】据路透社引十月二十七日曼谷报纸所载消息称，泰国銮披汶政府的法西斯军事集团“政变团”内部，已发生分裂和倾轧。据消息说，陆军副总司令銮角发给“政变团”全体团员一种机密小册子，警告团内的私人冲突，将临“爆炸点”。銮角在小册子里指出：团内存在着互相猜疑和腐化现象，并已达到这样一种程度，使团员间分裂成彼此倾轧残杀的派别。
    　　　　　　
    按：泰国“政变团”为一九四七年十一月发动“政变”的法西斯军人集团，该集团以泰国现任总理銮披汶为首，以陆军、流氓、特务分子为骨干，代表着泰国贵族、大地主及一部分买办资产阶级的势力。銮角为一九四七年“政变”的重要领袖之一，但现在则倾向于泰国统治集团中以乃宽为首的王派，与銮披汶政变团的嫡系，暗斗甚烈。
