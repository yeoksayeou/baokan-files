    The Soviet government cares about the continuous improvement of the people's material and cultural living standards. This year's national budget allocates 119 billion rubles to social and cultural undertakings, accounting for nearly 30% of the total national budget expenditure. These funds are specifically designated for the people's education, medical and health facilities for residents, subsidies for mothers with many children and widows, free sanatorium and vacation vouchers for workers and staff, and support for kindergartens, nurseries, and school summer villas.
    In the Soviet Union, there is a vast network of medical institutions, clubs, cultural recreation parks, and amusement parks serving the working people. Among them, the sanatoriums and rest homes under the jurisdiction of the trade unions alone number 1,117, serving more than two million workers and staff members this year. In addition, a large number of working people receive rest and treatment in sanatoriums, which are organized healthcare efforts of various government ministries and departments. Tens of thousands of Soviet people, mainly young people, spent their holidays traveling long distances across the beautiful motherland. The service-oriented tourist destinations and mountain camps set up by the trade unions enable these travel enthusiasts to achieve the enjoyment they need at the lowest cost.

    关心普通的人
    苏维埃政府关心人民物质和文化生活水平的不断提高。本年度国家预算的支出，在社会文化事业方面需要一千一百九十亿卢布，即占全部国家预算总支出的百分之三十弱，这些资金指定用作人民的教育事业、居民的医药卫生设施、子女众多及寡居母亲的补助金，无代价的发给工人职员的疗养券和休养券，扶助幼稚园、托儿所以及学校的避暑别墅等。
    在苏联有广大的医疗机关网、俱乐部、文化休息公园、游艺场为劳动者服务。其中仅工会所辖疗养院和休养所即达一一一七所，本年内为二百万以上的工人和职员服务。此外大量的劳动人民在疗养院里休养和治疗，是属于政府各部厅有组织的保健工作。成千成万的苏维埃人民，主要是青年人，在美丽的祖国大地上以远途旅行度过了假期。工会所设服务性的游览地和山间野营，使这些旅行的爱好者们，以最低的费用，达到他们所需要的享受。
