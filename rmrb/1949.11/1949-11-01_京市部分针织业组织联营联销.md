　　Beijing Municipal Partial Knitting Industry Organizations Form Joint Operation and Joint Sales
    [This newspaper reports] To overcome difficulties in operation, some manufacturers in the Beijing knitting industry have begun joint operations and joint sales. There are 757 households in the Beijing knitting industry, most of which are scattered family industries. Due to small capital and low technology, product quality is poor and there are no uniform specifications. In order to improve quality, ensure certain specifications, and open up sales channels, some knitting industries began to move towards joint operation in October. For example, Xinghua, Dalai, the Masses Women's Factory, and Fang Puyao Family Industrial Cooperative, and four other sock factories have centralized all their means of production and established the "Four-Factory Joint Operation Masses Sock Factory" on October 1st for joint production. Some of these four factories have capital but no technology (such as the Masses Women's Factory), some have technology but no capital (such as the Fang Puyao Family Industrial Cooperative), some are interested in running a factory (such as Manager Ba of the Dalai Factory), and some do not have time to take care of the factory due to many affairs (such as the manager of the Xinghua Factory). Joint operation has many advantages by complementing each other's shortcomings: (1) The personnel allocation is complete, and there are special personnel responsible for sales and production technology, and production has been expanded, (2) A lot of expenses are saved, (3) The capital is concentrated, and the turnover is large, so there is no longer the threat of stopping work after a week of not selling goods, (4) The technology is gradually improved, and workers have opportunities to learn from each other, (5) The specifications can be unified, and there are special personnel responsible for promotion, and sales have also greatly improved. In addition, Ling Shaofu, Zhang Jingxun, Chen Yimin and other thirteen family sock factories, due to lack of capital, were unable to continue to operate independently, and also began to jointly operate in a cooperative manner, and established the "Beijing Knitting Industry Family First United Cooperative", which officially started joint production on October 28.
    [Also News] The Beijing Knitting Industry Guild, the Production Technology Research Committee, in order to solve the difficulties in sales for the industry, with the assistance of the government, specially established a "Knitting Industry Joint Sales Office" to jointly promote the finished products of various manufacturers. The location is in the Dayaowang Temple Courtyard in Dongxiaoshi, which opened on October 28. A total of 286 knitting industry manufacturers participated in the joint promotion. The first step of the joint sales office is to promote the existing finished products of various manufacturers. In the future, uniform specifications will be set, and the trademark of the sales office will be affixed. Those that do not meet the standards will not be sold to be responsible to the customers; after the goods are sold, the money will be used to purchase yarn, which will be handed over to the original producers to continue production, to prevent manufacturers from suffering losses due to price fluctuations.

　　京市部分针织业组织联营联销
    【本报讯】北京针织业部分厂家开始联营联销，克服经营中的困难。京市针织业共七五七户，大部是分散的家庭工业，因资金小、技术低等原因，产品品质低劣，且没有统一的规格。为了提高品质，保证一定规格，打开销路，部分针织业于十月份开始走向联合经营。如兴华、大来、群众妇女工厂、方普耀家庭工业社等四家织袜厂将生产资料全部集中，于十月日成立“四家联营群众袜厂”，联合生产。这四家厂有的有资金没有技术（如群众妇女工厂），有的有技术没有资金（如方普耀家庭工业社），有的有经营工厂的兴趣（如大来厂经理八），有的因事情多无暇照顾工厂（如兴华厂经理），联营后互补短长，得到许多好处：（一）人事配备齐全，销货及生产技术都有专人负责，生产扩大了，（二）节省很多开支，（三）资金集中，周转力大，不致再有一星期不销货就停工的威胁，（四）技术逐渐改进，工人有互相学习机会，（五）规格可以统一，有专人负责推销，销路也大见好转。此外，凌绍复、张景洵、陈逸民等十三家家庭织袜厂，因资金缺少，无法继续单独经营，也开始以合作方式联合经营，成立“北京针织工业家庭第一联合社”，已于十月二十八日起正式开工联合生产。
    【又讯】北京市针织业公会，生产技术研究委员会，为解决同业销货困难，在政府协助下，特成立“针织业联合售品处”，联合推销各厂家成品，地点设东晓市药王庙大院，已于十月二十八日开幕。参加联合推销的针织业厂家共达二八六户。联合售品处第一步先推销各厂家的现有成品，以后即定出统一的规格，贴上售品处之商标，不够格者不予售卖，以对顾主负责；售出货后，即将款购成纱，交原生产者继续生产，以防物价波动时各厂家遭受损失。
