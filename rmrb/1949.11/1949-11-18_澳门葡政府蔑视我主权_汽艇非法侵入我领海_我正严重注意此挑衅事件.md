　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 16th. The provocative incident of Portuguese warships in Macau openly intruding into our territorial waters to rescue ships of the Kuomintang bandit gang has attracted the attention of people here. On November 5, after the People's Liberation Army on the Guangdong Zhongshan front cleared out the remnants of the bandit 109th Army 321st Division and the Security 3rd Division in Wanzi area opposite Macau, it discovered that the Kuomintang Navy's 4th Combat and Defense Fleet's "Jili," "Guangqiang," "Gaoyao," and "Qingyuan" four gunboats and several small gunboats and patrol boats were anchored in our territorial waters of Yin Keng, Macau. Among them, the "Jili" and "Qingyuan" gunboats were anchored only 800 meters away from the PLA's coastal positions. The PLA closely monitored them and ordered a halt to navigation. Soon, several enemy ships moved against orders, and at the same time, the "Qingyuan" openly resisted, firing at us with two 25mm anti-aircraft guns and one 12.7mm and one 13mm anti-aircraft guns. Our artillery immediately returned fire, destroying part of its engine and one aircraft machine gun, injuring several people. Because the boat was unable to escape, it immediately waved a white flag to surrender and sent Liu Dezhi and two others to contact the PLA, willing to hand over the light and heavy weapons on board and sail the "Qingyuan" closer to the PLA's station. The PLA then sent representatives to the boat to accept the surrender. The boat's captain, Yang Zijiang, also expressed his willingness to accept the terms of surrender, saying that he would wait for the tide to rise and then sail the gunboat over, and had already handed over one machine gun and five rifles. Before the surrender, the Portuguese government in Macau illegally dispatched a motorboat to invade our territorial waters and hijacked part of the people and guns from the boat, and later sent a boat to forcibly tow the boat away. The boat was carrying more than 100 bandit soldiers and officers, about 100 barrels of gasoline, and part of the weapons and ammunition. Before this, when the PLA was fighting the enemy ships, two Portuguese ships frequently scouted with a hostile attitude and pointed their guns at the PLA positions.

　　澳门葡政府蔑视我主权
  　汽艇非法侵入我领海
    我正严重注意此挑衅事件
    【新华社北京十六日电】澳门葡萄牙舰艇公然侵入我国领海援救国民党匪帮舰船的挑衅事件，已引起此间人士的注意。十一月五日，广东中山前线人民解放军于肃清澳门对岸湾仔一带匪一○九军三二一师残部及保三师残部等后，发现国民党海军第四战防舰艇队“吉利”、“光强”、“高要”、“清远”四艘炮舰及小炮艇、巡艇若干艘，在澳门银坑我领海内停泊。其中“吉利”及“清远”两炮舰艇停泊位置，距解放军阵地海岸仅八百公尺，解放军当予严密监视，并下令停航。不久，敌舰艇有数艘违令开动，同时，“清远”号且公然抵抗，以二十五＠机关炮各二门，十二、十三＠机关炮各一门向我射击，我军炮兵即开炮还击，击毁其发动机一部，及航空机枪一挺，伤其数人。该艇因已无法逃走，当即挥白旗请降，并派来刘德智等三人与解放军接洽，愿将艇上轻、重武器缴出，并将“清远”号驶近解放军驻地。解放军乃派代表同赴该艇受降。该艇艇长杨子江亦愿接受投降条件，表示等候水涨，即将炮艇驶来，并已缴出机关枪一挺，步枪五支。当受降之前，澳门葡萄牙政府竟非法派遣汽艇一艘，侵入我领海将该艇人枪一部劫走，嗣后又派船强行拖走该艇。艇上载有匪军官兵共百余人，汽油约百余桶，武器弹药一部。在此以前在解放军与敌军舰艇作战时，萄舰艇二艘即以敌对态度频频侦察，并将炮口指向解放军阵地。
