Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, November 11th: News reports indicate that the rivalry between the US and the UK in the Near East is intensifying. According to the Ash Shaak newspaper, the US representative in Damascus has requested that the Syrian government guarantee the continued validity of the agreement signed between former Syrian dictator Husni al-Za'im and the American "Trans-Arabian Pipeline Company" (Tapline). The Syrian government has consulted with the British representative on the US request. The newspaper further states that the British representative advised the current Syrian Prime Minister al-Atassi to delay negotiations on this issue until after the Syrian elections, because the agreement signed with Tapline is expected to be declared illegal by then.

    掠夺叙利亚石油
    美英矛盾加剧
    【新华社北京十四日电】塔斯社贝鲁特十一日讯：报纸的消息显示美英在近东的角逐越来越加剧。据亚许·沙克报消息：美国驻大马士革的代表曾要求叙利亚政府保证前叙利亚独裁者萨姆与美国“阿拉伯大油管公司”所签订的协定继续有效。叙利亚政府为此特征询英国代表对于美国要求的意见。该报继称：英国代表劝告叙利亚现任总理亚塔西把这个问题的谈判拖延到叙利亚选举结束的时候，因为与“阿拉伯大油管公司”所签订的协定届时估计将被宣布为不合法。
