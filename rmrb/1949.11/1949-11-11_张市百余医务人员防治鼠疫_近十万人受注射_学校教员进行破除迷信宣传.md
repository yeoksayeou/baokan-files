    Over a Hundred Medical Personnel in Zhangjiakou Fight Plague
    Nearly 100,000 People Inoculated
    School Teachers Conduct Propaganda to Eliminate Superstition
    [Special Dispatch from Zhangjiakou by This Newspaper] According to the plague prevention plan established by Comrade Hekhlova, leader of the Soviet Anti-Epidemic Team, Zhangjiakou's anti-epidemic work is being intensified. Since the 7th, a total of 136 Chinese and Soviet anti-epidemic personnel and provincial and municipal medical workers have been formed into 23 injection teams, which have been working in the urban area. As of the evening of the 8th, statistics show that more than 93,800 people have been inoculated. Except for those exempted from injection (referring to children under the age of five and patients with pulmonary tuberculosis or heart disease), it is estimated that all injections can be completed before the 10th. At present, a relatively complete infectious disease hospital has been established in Zhangjiakou, which can perform tests, dissections, disinfection, and bacterial culture. On the 9th, a disinfection station was set up in the city center. One hundred secondary school students were divided into ten rat-catching teams to assist Soviet anti-epidemic team animal expert Kamnev and personnel from the Central Anti-Epidemic Team in mobilizing and guiding citizens to catch rats and kill fleas (first using traps, then poison). It is stipulated that residents should report to the anti-epidemic station in a timely manner if they discover dead rats. All dead rats and captured rodents must be inspected by the laboratory to detect whether there is an epidemic among the rats. In order to accommodate contacts of suspected plague patients, an isolation center has been set up in each district. Chinese and Soviet diagnosis and treatment teams are dispatched to various districts every day for diagnosis and treatment. Starting from the 8th, Comrade Klavchenko, the second leader of the Soviet Anti-Epidemic Team, and several others traveled from morning to night to the epidemic village of Ji’s House and neighboring villages for mobile diagnosis and treatment. In order to strengthen propaganda and education for citizens, Comrade Hekhlova, infectious disease expert Kerbatov, animal expert Kamnev, and others will give lectures on plague prevention knowledge on Zhangjiakou People's Broadcasting Station for three consecutive evenings starting on the 9th. On the afternoon of the 8th, Comrade Hekhlova gave a lecture to more than 2,000 hygiene committee members, hygiene team leaders, and cadres from various streets and lanes in the first district of Zhangjiakou, entitled "Thorough Prevention of Plague." She emphasized that as long as rat-catching, flea-killing, garbage removal, preventive inoculation, isolation of patients and disinfection of their contact objects, and the implementation of blockades in epidemic areas are thoroughly carried out, the plague cannot occur, and if it does, it will be quickly eliminated. At present, it has been discovered in the first district of Zhangjiakou that some residents are using superstitious methods to "prevent the plague." For example, on Gongye Street, a witch is "invoking the great god" to see patients. In Heishi Dam and Fushou Street, some residents are hanging small red pockets filled with grains and miscellaneous grains on their gates and on children, saying that they can "avoid the plague god" and "ward off evil spirits." It is reported that the district has decided to strengthen education to eliminate superstition so that they can accept scientific epidemic prevention methods from an ideological standpoint to prevent the plague. In order to strengthen propaganda and education, the Third District has organized 110 primary school teachers, who have been temporarily trained, to go deep into the households of residents to carry out propaganda and explanation work.

    张市百余医务人员防治鼠疫
    近十万人受注射
    学校教员进行破除迷信宣传
    【本报张家口专电】按照苏联防疫队赫赫洛娃分队长既定的防疫计划，张家口市防疫工作正加紧进行。从七日起，中苏防疫人员及省、市医务工作者共一百三十六人，配备组成二十三个注射小组，分头在市区进行注射。至八日晚统计，已注射九万三千八百余名，除免注者外（指五岁以下幼童与肺结核、心脏病患者）预计于十日前定能全部注射完毕。目前张市已建立了一所比较完备的传染病医院，可以化验、解剖、消毒与培养菌型。九日，在市中心开始设立一个消毒站，并由一百个中等学校学生分组十个捕鼠队，协助苏联防疫队动物专家卡姆聂夫及中央防疫一队人员动员与指导市民捕鼠灭蚤，（第一步先使用夹子，第二步使用毒药。）规定居民如发现死鼠时，应及时向防疫站报告。所有死鼠及捕得的鼠类，必须经化验室的检查，以便侦查鼠类中是否有疫情发生。为收容疑似鼠疫患者的接触人，每区已设立了一个隔离所，中苏检诊组每日出动各区随时检诊。八日起，苏防疫队第二分队长克拉夫钦克等一行数人，每日从晨到晚出发疫村姬家房子及邻近村作巡回检诊。为加强对市民的宣教工作，赫赫洛娃分队长、传染病专家克尔巴叩夫、动物专家卡姆聂夫等从九日起，将连续三个晚上在张家口人民广播电台讲解防疫常识。赫赫洛娃分队长于八日下午给张市一区各街闾的卫生委员、卫生小组长及干部市民等两千余人，讲“彻底预防鼠疫”，她着重指出：只要把捕鼠灭蚤、清除垃圾、预防注射、隔离病患者及其接触物的消毒、对疫区实行封锁等工作彻底做到，鼠疫就不可能发生，发生了也就很快被消灭。目前张市一区已发现有的民户用迷信的办法“防避鼠疫”，如工业大街有一神婆子“下大神”看病，黑石坝、福寿街有些居民在大门口和小孩子身上挂上装有五谷杂粮的小红口袋，说可以“避瘟神”、“避邪气”。闻该区决加强教育破除迷信，使其从思想上接受科学的防疫办法来防避鼠疫。为加强宣传教育，三区已组织了一百一十个小学教员，经临时训练，已深入到各居民户进行宣传解释工作。
