　　The Industrial and Mining Industries of Daye After Liberation
　　Lin Xi
　　Daye, Hubei is one of the most famous industrial and mining areas in the country, with rich deposits of coal, iron, limestone, and other minerals. Since the Qing Dynasty, the Hanyeping Company, coal companies, and cement plants have successively mined here. After the Japanese surrender, the puppet Resources Committee established the Central China Iron and Steel Company here; other important industrial and mining industries included the Daye Power Plant of the Enan Power Company, the joint public-private Huaxin Cement Plant, and two larger private coal mines, with a total of more than 6,000 employees. The iron ore in the Daye mining area has an average iron content of over 65%, and although it has been mined for decades, it still contains 35 million tons. Since liberation, the People's Government has attached great importance to the industrial and mining industries in this area, and has invested in and assisted in the construction of factories in many ways to enable the various public and private factories and mines to rapidly restore and exceed the production levels of the Kuomintang rule.
　　The Central China Iron and Steel Company has more than 1,300 workers. The Kuomintang reactionaries operated it for three years after the Japanese surrender. In addition to stealing and selling some iron sand to the Japanese, they never carried out any production. However, five months after liberation, the workers have repaired the 30-ton iron-smelting furnace and can start production as soon as the coke is transported; the one-and-a-half-ton Bessemer steel-making furnace has also been installed and has entered normal production in September, with a monthly output of 40 tons of ordinary carbon steel ingots and 10 tons of steel castings; the three-ton electric furnace will be installed and put into production within the year. The fifteen-ton open-hearth furnace is also under construction. Since we took over the rolling mill, we have invested 700 million yuan. The 10-inch rolling mill has now been installed and can produce various round bar steel, square billet steel, round square ribbed steel, angle iron, and flat iron this month, which can be used for bridge building, shipbuilding, and vehicle repair. If three shifts are worked per day, 21 tons of steel ingots can be produced. The 17-inch rolling mill is being built by the efforts of all employees in the repair shop and has been 60% completed. It is expected to start production at the beginning of next year, and 30 tons of steel ingots can be produced per day in three shifts (products include 12-pound steel rails per yard). The entire plant strives to complete the 10,000-ton steel ingot production plan by August next year.
　　The joint public-private Huaxin Cement Plant is equipped with the latest machines, with a maximum daily production of 1,000 tons. Limestone is inexhaustible here, and Yingcheng gypsum can also be transported down the Yangtze River. However, before liberation, it was shut down due to lack of sales. After liberation, the bank provided nearly 400 million yuan in loans, immediately made up for the three months of arrears in wages during the Kuomintang period, and quickly resumed work. The Central China Trading Company has already placed orders with it, and the output is increasing month by month. Currently, due to insufficient power and transportation capacity, only one kiln is operating for half a month each month, with a daily output of 300 tons of cement. The product is universal Portland cement, which has been tested to withstand 4,200 pounds of pressure per square inch of cement block. Currently, the Yuehan Railway, Shanghai, Jiangxi, and other places have placed orders with it one after another, and there is a situation of insufficient supply.
　　As the lifeline of the limestone kiln industry, the power plant has 6,000 kilowatts of power generation equipment, which was originally used by the Japanese for mining. The machines are old, and currently can only generate 3,000 kilowatts, barely maintaining the production of various factories and mines. In order to expand the production of the original factories and mines and to meet the power needs after the Central China Iron and Steel Company is fully operational, the Industrial Department of the Central Plains People's Provisional Government has invested 700 million yuan to assist the plant in installing two new 5,000-kilowatt generators, which are expected to start supplying power next spring.
　　The private Yuanhua and Lihua Coal Mining Companies, which have been mining for 40 years, have more than 4,000 employees. Before liberation, the daily output of coal was 130 tons, which had increased to 340 to 390 tons by the end of August; the production efficiency decreased from 7.04 workers per ton in June to 6.04 workers per ton in August, that is, one worker less per ton. This is because after liberation, the workers abolished the illegal exploitation of the "batou" (i.e., contracting counters), and the implementation of the wage system based on the actual value of goods has ensured the workers' lives and greatly improved their production morale. In order to support the development of production in the mine, the government has successively loaned 517 million yuan to solve the difficulties in capital turnover and to build transportation tools, etc., and to solve the problem of sales for it. For example, in the three and a half months from June to mid-September, 88% of the 11,572 metric tons of coal sold to Wuhan by Lihua Company were purchased by state-owned coal companies and various factories.
　　Steel, cement, and coal are indispensable treasures for building a new China. According to statistics, the Central China region imported about 600,000 tons of steel annually before the Anti-Japanese War. After liberation, China's demand will far exceed this number. The demand for cement and coal will also increase sharply. People will see that under the leadership of the People's Government, it will not take long for the industrial and mining industries of Daye to develop.

### 解放后的大冶工矿业

　　解放后的大冶工矿业
　　林晰
    湖北大冶是全国著名工矿区之一，境内煤、铁、石灰石等矿藏极富。清朝以来，先后有汉冶萍公司、煤矿公司及水泥厂在此开采。日寇投降后，伪资源委员会在此设立华中钢铁公司；其他重要工矿业尚有鄂南电力公司大冶发电厂、公私合营的华新水泥厂及两家较大的私营煤矿，职工合计约六千余人。大冶矿区的铁矿含铁量平均为百分之六十五以上，虽经数十年的开采，尚藏有三千五百万吨。解放以来，人民政府对此地区的工矿业极为重视，为使各公私营厂矿得以迅速恢复和超过国民党统治时期的生产水平，曾多方投资协助建厂工作。
    华中钢铁公司有工人一千三百余人，国民党反动派在日寇投降后经营了三年。他们除盗卖了一些铁砂给日本人外，从未进行过什么生产。但在解放五个月后的今天，工人们已经把三十吨的炼铁炉修好，等焦炭运到后，就可开炉生产；一吨半的贝色麦炼钢炉也装好了，九月份即已步入正常生产，每月可产普通炭素钢锭四十吨，铸钢件十吨；三吨电炉年内按装完毕，即可进行生产。十五吨平炉亦在铸建中。轧钢厂在我们接收以来，已投资七亿元，现十英寸轧钢机按装完毕，本月即可出产各色元条钢、方胚钢、元方竹节钢、角铁及扁铁等，可供架桥、修船、修车之用。每日如开三班工，可产钢锭二十一吨。十七英寸轧钢机在修造厂经全全员工努力赶造，已完成百分之六十，明年初当可开工生产，每日三班制可产钢锭三十吨（产品包括每码十二磅的钢轨）。全厂争取在明年八月间完成万吨钢锭生产计划。
    公私合营的华新水泥厂装有最新式的机器，每天最高生产量为一千吨。石灰石在这里是取之不尽的，应城石膏亦可顺长江而下。但在解放前，因为没有销路而停了工。解放后银行予以近四亿元的贷款，立即补发了国民党时期的三个月欠薪，很快得以复工，中原贸易公司已向其订货，现产量逐月增加。目前因电力及运输力不足一个窑每月仅有半个月开工，日产水泥三百吨。产品为普遍卜特兰水泥，经试验每一平方寸水泥块，可耐四千二百磅压力。现粤汉铁路、上海、江西等处纷纷向其订购，已有供不应求之势。
    作为石灰窑工业命脉的电力厂，有六千基罗瓦特发电设备，原系日寇在时专供采矿之用，机器陈旧，目前仅能发电三千基罗瓦特，勉强维持各厂矿生产。为扩大原有厂矿生产及适应华中钢铁公司全部开工后的用电需要，中原人民临时政府工业部已投资七亿元，协助该厂装置五千基罗瓦特新式发电机两部，预计明春即可开始供电。
    开采达四十年之久的私营源华、利华煤矿公司，拥有员工四千余人。解放前夕，日产煤一百三十吨，至八月底已增至日产三百四十至三百九十吨；生产效率由六月份每吨需工七·○四人减为八月份的每吨需工六·○四人，即每吨减工一人。这是由于在解放后，工人废除了把头（即包工柜）的非法剥削，加之实行了按实物折款的工资制度，使工人生活得到适当保证，生产情绪大为提高。为扶助该矿发展生产，政府先后曾贷款五亿一千七百万元，解决资金周转的困难及修建运输工具等，并为其解决销路问题。如利华公司在六月至九月半三个半月中，销至武汉的煤一一五七二公吨中有百分之八十八为公营煤业公司及各工厂所购入。
    钢铁、水泥、煤块，这都是建设新中国不可缺少的珍品。据统计华中地区在抗战前，每年输入钢铁约六十万吨，解放后的中国，需用量当远远超过此数。水泥、煤的需要亦必激增。人们会看到：在人民政府的领导下，不要多长的时间，大冶的工矿就会要发展起来的。
