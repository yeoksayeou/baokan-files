　　[Our Newspaper] The Chief Delegate of the Mongolian People's Republic to the Asian-Australasian Trade Union Conference, Adliibish, answered reporters' questions on the 19th. The original text is as follows:

　　Question: The Mongolian People's Republic has rapidly built itself into a modern country on the basis of a primitive natural economy. What valuable experiences have you had in this process?

　　Answer: I think the most important experience is that our country is developing on a non-capitalist path. This is the experience of realizing that so-called backward countries, with the assistance of countries where the proletariat has won victory, can directly ascend to socialist society without going through the capitalist stage.

　　Question: In what areas has the Soviet Union helped the Mongolian People's Republic?

　　Answer: From the day our country formally became independent, the Soviet Union has given the Mongolian People's Republic care and assistance, cancelled all old debts, and completely handed over to our country all industries formerly operated by Russia on Mongolian territory.

　　The progress of the Mongolian people in economic and cultural aspects is the result of Soviet assistance.

　　National industry has been built in Mongolia, road transportation has been developed, and animal husbandry and cultural and artistic undertakings have been developed. The Soviet Union has also provided a great deal of assistance in this regard.

　　The Soviet Union has not only helped the Mongolian People's Republic in the development of economic and cultural undertakings, but also provided our country with unforgettable and enormous assistance in protecting the independence and integrity of our territory and opposing the Japanese imperialist schemes of aggression.

　　Regarding the Soviet Union's assistance, the Mongolian working people express their heartfelt gratitude to the Soviet people and the great leader of mankind, Marshal Stalin, with infinite joy. The Mongolian people are even more willing to consolidate their brotherly friendship with the Soviet Union.

　　Question: What is the current situation of industrial production in your country? What is the living situation of the workers?

　　Answer: Before the revolution, our country did not have any national industrial production of its own. Since the victory of the revolution, with the assistance of the Soviet Union, national industry has been built in the Mongolian People's Republic and is developing day by day. Now there are food, textile, electricity, leather, boots, mining and metallurgy, machinery, wool washing, felt making and other industries.

　　Our industry is equipped with modern machinery. These industries are all state-owned and operated by social cooperation.

　　According to the First Five-Year Plan, by 1952, our country's industrial output will increase by 98.9 percent compared to 1948.

　　Our working class no longer knows what oppression and exploitation are. Their lives are continuing to improve. Please see the summary on this situation at the Asian-Australasian Trade Union Conference.

　　Question: In the economic structure of the Mongolian People's Republic, what is the proportion of industry, agriculture, and animal husbandry?

　　Answer: The Mongolian People's Republic is a country based on animal husbandry. But even so, it also develops industry and agriculture in the same way, and has now achieved considerable results. In addition, these three parts of the economy maintain close ties with each other on the principle of mutual assistance and develop.

　　Question: How is animal husbandry in the Mongolian People's Republic moving towards modernization?

　　Answer: The basis of our people's livelihood is animal husbandry. In this regard, the state has helped the people in various ways and has achieved great results in the years since the victory of the revolution. We pay special attention to importing veterinary and livestock production technologies and establishing veterinary medicine factories. In each Aimag (i.e. province), Sum (county) and each Bag (village/township), there are also veterinary institutions with many veterinary cadres with higher and secondary technologies. Schools that train higher and secondary veterinary technicians train and train many experts every year. Our country has carried out tremendous work in preventing various animal diseases to protect the people's livestock, and veterinary experiments are carried out regularly. In order to give the people the right to treat their livestock free of charge, the government allocates large amounts of funds every year. Regarding livestock production technology, work is being carried out to improve livestock breeds, prepare high-quality feed, correctly utilize pastures, and prepare warm livestock sheds. Long-term loans are issued to herdsmen, and such loans are available to anyone. In order to develop animal husbandry, the state has helped the people to set up state-owned livestock farms and grass-cutting machine stations, as well as technical teams to match excellent livestock breeds. At the same time, it widely manufactures livestock equipment and transports it to areas in need. Another important measure taken regarding pastoral affairs is to exchange the experience of herdsmen and encourage herdsmen with excellent results. At the same time, livestock products are also fully utilized, and modern enterprises such as cream factories have been opened.

　　In order to encourage the development of animal husbandry, competitions have been launched among herdsmen and outstanding herdsmen have been rewarded. In addition, conferences of excellent herdsmen and rural economic workers are often held nationwide. Herdsmen who have achieved the best results in animal husbandry are awarded the highest national medals and honorary medals, and can obtain the glorious title of "National Excellent Herdsman" and the badge of Excellent Herdsman. Now the work of such award-winning herdsmen is developing more and more. In terms of improving pastoral knowledge, in addition to conducting lectures and discussions, publications, radio and movies are used for education. Because these methods have been adopted, our country's animal husbandry has developed smoothly, and the people's lives have therefore been continuously improved. (Attached picture)

　　亚澳工会会议蒙古首席代表
  　阿德利比什答记者问
    介绍蒙古生产建设情况与经验
    【本报讯】参加亚洲澳洲工会会议的蒙古人民共和国首席代表阿德利比什于十九日答记者问，原文如下：
    问：蒙古人民共和国在原始自然经济的基础上，迅速建设成近代化的国家。在这个过程中有些什么宝贵的经验？
    答：我认为最主要的经验是我们的国家是在非资本主义的道路上发展着，这是实现使所谓落后的国家在无产阶级获得胜利的国家援助下，不经过资本主义阶段直接升入社会主义社会的经验。
    问：苏联对于蒙古人民共和国作了那些方面的帮助？
    答：自我国正式独立的那天起，苏联即给蒙古人民共和国以关心与帮助，取消了一切旧债，并将在蒙古领土上旧俄所经营的一切产业，完全交给了我国。
    蒙古人民群众在经济文化方面的进步，是苏联帮助的成绩。
    蒙古国内建设了民族工业，发展了道路交通，并发展了畜牧业经济和文化艺术事业，在这方面苏联也给了许多帮助。
    苏联不仅对蒙古人民共和国在发展经济文化事业上给了帮助，并且在保护我国领土的独立完整和反对日本帝国主义侵略阴谋方面，也给了我国以永远难忘的巨大援助。
    对于苏联的帮助，蒙古劳动人民以无限欢欣的心情向苏联人民及人类伟大的领袖斯大林大元帅表示衷心的感谢，蒙古人民更愿望日益巩固与苏联的兄弟般的友好关系。
    问：目前贵国工业生产的情况怎样？工人的生活情况怎样？
    答：在革命以前，我国没有自己民族的任何工业生产，在革命胜利以来，得到苏联的援助，在蒙古人民共和国内已建设了民族工业，且在日益发展着。现在有食品、纺织、电力、皮革、靴子、矿冶、机械、洗毛、制毡等工业。
    我国的工业是以现代化的机器装备起来的，这些工业都是国营的及社会合作经营的。
    按照第一次五年计划，到一九五二年，我国的工业产量将比一九四八年增加百分之九十八·九。
    我国的工人阶级已经不知道什么是压迫与剥削，他们的生活在继续提高，关于此项情形请看在亚澳工会会议上的总结。
    问：在蒙古人民共和国的经济构成中，工业、农业、畜牧业三者的比重怎样？
    答：蒙古人民共和国是以牧畜业经济为主的国家。但虽然如此，也同样的发展工业与农业，现在已得到不少的成绩。此外在这三部分经济之间在彼此协助的原则下保持密切的联系而发展着。
    问：蒙古人民共和国的畜牧业是怎样走向近代化的？
    答：我国人民的生活基础是畜牧业，在这方面，国家以各种方法帮助人民进行了巨大的工作，在革命胜利以来的年代中，已得到了良好的成绩。我们特别注意输进兽医和畜产技术，设立了兽医药厂。在各爱林克（即省）苏末（县）与各巴格（村乡）中，也有了拥有很多高等和中等技术的兽医干部人员的兽医机关。培养高等和中等兽医技术人员的学校，每年都训练出和训练着不少专家。我国在预防各种兽疫方面进行了巨大的工作，以保护人民的牲畜，并经常进行兽医试验工作。为了给人民以无代价的医疗自己牲畜的权利，政府每年拨出了大宗的款项。关于畜产技术方面，进行着改良畜产品种，准备质地精良的饲料，正确利用牧场，准备温暖的牲畜圈棚等工作。对于牧民发给长期的贷款，此种贷款无论何人均可得到。为发展畜牧业起见，国家帮助人民设立了国营畜产场和割草机器站，以及配合牲畜优良品种的技术队。同时还广泛地制造畜牧业用具，并将其运送到需用的地区。关有牧业方面所采取的又一个重要措施，即是交换牧民的经验，鼓励成绩优良的牧民。同时还充分利用着畜牧业的产品，开办了奶油工厂等现代化的企业。
    为了鼓励畜牧业的发展，在牧民间展开了竞赛运动，并奖励优秀牧民。此外还在全国范围内经常召开优等牧民与村乡经济工作者会议。在畜牧事业上，表现最优良成绩的牧民，授予国家最高等奖励勋章与名誉勋章，并可得“国家优等牧民”的光荣称号与优等牧民徽。现在此种奖状牧民的工作更日益发展着。在提高牧业知识方面，除进行讲解座谈外，并利用刊物、广播、电影进行教育。因为采取了这些方式，就使我国的畜牧业获得顺利发展，人民生活因此也不断改善了。（附图片）
