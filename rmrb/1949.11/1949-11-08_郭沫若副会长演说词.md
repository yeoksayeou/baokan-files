Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 7th: Vice President Guo Moruo's speech at the celebration of the 32nd anniversary of the October Revolution, organized by the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, entitled: "A Speech Celebrating the October Revolution" reads as follows:

　　The great October Revolution today welcomes its 32nd anniversary, a great festival jointly rejoiced and encouraged by peace-loving people and supporters of the true democratic system all over the world. People all over the world, like the great Soviet people, universally express their congratulations with full enthusiasm. We can hear countless different languages, from countless different voices, shouting: Long live the October Revolution! Glory to the great Soviet people! Glory to the Bolshevik Party! Glory to scientific socialism! Glory to Lenin-Stalin, the great revolutionary teachers of all mankind!

　　The success of the October Revolution eliminated the class system of man exploiting man, opening a new era in human history. The great achievements of the Soviet Union in the past thirty-two years have further proved that Marxism-Leninism-Stalinism is a universal truth, that practicing this truth is the only correct path for the cause of human liberation, and that it is a path that is bound to succeed.

　　With the October Revolution, the liberation of all mankind has light and hope. With the great achievements of the Soviet Union in the past thirty-two years, this light is even more brilliant, and this hope is even more imminent. Facts speak louder than words, and the current facts in China are the best proof.

　　Our Chinese people, illuminated by the great torch of the October Revolution, saw the way out to liberate themselves. Our leader Mao Zedong's thought is the most practical application and development of Marxism-Leninism-Stalinism in China's revolutionary practice. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, our Chinese people have studied the Soviet Union, followed the path of the Soviet Union, and worked hard for nearly thirty years. Today, our people's revolution has achieved unprecedented victory, and soon we will liberate all of our 475 million compatriots, who account for a quarter of the world's population.

　　Our victory is the victory of Mao Zedong Thought, the victory of Marxism-Leninism-Stalinism, and to put it more directly, it is the direct influence of the great October Revolution.

　　Having achieved such a victory, having gained basic freedom and independence, and having established the People's Republic of China, we commemorate the October Revolution, which makes us even more aware of the significance of the October Revolution, even more aware of the immortality of Marxism-Leninism-Stalinism and Mao Zedong Thought, and increases our infinite confidence in victory.

　　The slogans issued by the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) to commemorate the 32nd anniversary of the October Revolution are such a magnificent and incomparable march! Although it is mainly a call to the Soviet people, it is also a call to the working people of the world. Although the people of various countries have different degrees of advancement and backwardness in development, and the various posts have different degrees of importance in the steps of work, the spirit is consistent, the direction is consistent, the road to socialism and communism is consistent, and the efforts to eliminate all obstacles on the inevitable road are consistent. Therefore, we must sincerely accept the spirit in that call, respond to our own degree of development, and stand at our own work posts to make the greatest efforts.

　　The seventh item of the slogan clearly calls on us: "Working people of all countries: Defending peace is the cause of all nations and peoples of the world! Expose the aggressive plans of the instigators of new wars! Unite all forces and fight for lasting peace and the security of all countries!"

　　Yes, we sincerely accept. We must make all the Chinese people realize that "defending peace is the cause of all nations and peoples of the world." We must awaken all the Chinese people to use all our strength to "expose the aggressive plans of the instigators of new wars" and "unite all forces and fight for lasting peace and the security of all countries."

　　We deeply know that this sacred task is inseparable from the revolutionary war we are currently waging, and inseparable from the high tide of economic construction that has arrived and the high tide of cultural construction that is about to arrive. We must resolutely carry the revolutionary war to the end, and then the security of our country can be guaranteed, and the peace of the Far East and even the lasting peace of the world can be guaranteed. We must also rapidly advance our economic construction, cultural construction, and other aspects of construction in a planned and step-by-step manner, so that our backward agricultural China becomes an advanced industrial China, and then our revolution can be considered truly carried out to the end.

　　To accomplish this sacred task, the responsibility is arduous. But we are not discouraged at all. The success of the October Revolution gives us supreme encouragement, and the valuable experience of the Soviet people over the past thirty-two years gives us a lofty model. As long as we can "unite all forces" and "fight" unyieldingly against the new war instigators of the imperialist camp, we are bound to be able to complete the task.

　　All of our Chinese people already have a common oath. Domestically, we must unite under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, practice the people's democratic dictatorship, oppose imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and strive for China's independence, democracy, peace, unity, prosperity, and strength. Internationally, we must "unite with all peace-loving and freedom-loving countries and people in the world, first of all, unite with the Soviet Union, all people's democratic countries, and all oppressed nations, stand on the side of the international peace and democracy camp, and jointly oppose imperialist aggression to safeguard lasting world peace." We must do our best to practice this oath, use action and achievements to commemorate the great October Revolution, and use action and achievements to repay the deep friendship of the Soviet people.

　　We respectfully extend our brotherly salute to the pioneers of human liberation, the great Soviet people!
　　Long live the great October Socialist Revolution!
　　Long live the strong fortress of world peace—the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics!
　　Long live the great Bolshevik Party, the Party of Lenin and Stalin!
　　Long live the victory of Marxism-Leninism-Stalinism and Mao Zedong Thought!
　　Long live the great revolutionary teacher of all mankind, Marshal Stalin!

　　郭沫若副会长演说词
    【新华社北京七日电】中苏友好协会总会副会长郭沫若在该会主办的十月革命三十二周年庆祝会上的演说词，题：“庆祝十月革命致词”文如下：
    伟大的十月革命，今天迎接他的三十二周年纪念，这是爱好和平、拥护真正民主制度的全世界人民所共同欢欣鼓舞的一个伟大的节庆。全世界人民都和伟大的苏联人民一样，普遍地以满腔的热诚来表示庆贺。我们可以听出有无数不同的语言，从无数不同的喉舌中，在高呼着：十月革命万岁！光荣属于伟大的苏联人民！光荣属于布尔什维克党！光荣属于科学的社会主义！光荣属于全人类伟大的革命导师列宁—斯大林！
    十月革命的成功，消灭了人剥削人的阶级制度，在人类史上已经开辟了一个新纪元。三十二年来苏联建国的伟大成就，更证明了马恩列斯主义是放诸四海而皆准的真理，实践这一真理是全人类解放事业唯一正确的道路，而且是必然获得成功的道路。
    有了十月革命、全人类的解放便有了光明，有了希望。有了三十二年来苏联建国的伟大成就，这光明是更加灿烂，这希望是更加迫近了。事实胜于雄辩，我们中国当前的事实便是绝好的证明。
    我们中国人民是在十月革命这伟大的火炬照明之下看出了解放自己的出路的。我们的领袖毛泽东的思想便是马恩列斯主义在中国的革命实际中最切实的运用和展开。我们中国人民在毛主席和中国共产党的领导之下学习苏联，走苏联的路，努力了将近三十年，在今天我们的人民革命已经获得了空前的大胜利，不久便要把我们占全世界人口四分之一的四万万七千五百万的同胞全部解放了。
    我们的胜利是毛泽东思想的胜利，是马恩列斯主义的胜利，更直切了当的说，就是伟大的十月革命的直接影响。
    我们在获得了这样的胜利，在获得了基本的自由和独立，在成立了中华人民共和国的今天，来纪念十月革命节，这就使得我们更加认识了十月革命的意义，更加认识了马恩列斯主义和毛泽东思想的不朽性，而增进了无穷的必胜的信心。
    联共中央所颁布的纪念十月革命三十二周年的口号，那是多么波澜壮阔的雄浑无比的一部进行曲呵！那虽然主要是对于苏联人民的号召，但同时也就是对于全世界劳动人民的号召。虽然各国人民在发展的程度上有先进后进的不同，各种岗位在工作的步骤上也有畸轻畸重的区别，但精神是一致的，方向是一致的，通过社会主义走向共产主义的道路是一致的，铲除必由的道路上所有一切障碍的努力是一致的。因此我们要诚恳地接受那号召中的精神，应着我们自己发展的程度，站在我们自己工作的岗位上而尽最大的努力。
    口号的第七项更明白地号召着我们：“一切国家的劳动人民们：保卫和平是全世界一切民族人民的事业！揭穿新战争挑拨者的侵略计划！团结一切力量，为持久和平与各国安全而斗争！”
    是的，我们诚恳地接受。我们一定要使全中国人民都认识到“保卫和平是全世界一切民族人民的事业。”我们一定要唤起全中国的人民把我们所有的力量用来“揭穿新战争挑拨者的侵略计划”，并“团结一切力量，为持久和平与各国安全而斗争”。
    这项神圣的任务，我们深切地知道，和我们现在所进行着的革命战争是分不开来的，和我们已经到来的经济建设的高潮和将要到来的文化建设的高潮是分不开来的。我们一定要坚决地将革命战争进行到底，然后本国的安全才能得到保障，远东的和平以至全世界的持久和平也才能得到保障。我们也一定要把我们的经济建设、文化建设和其它各方面的建设有计划有步骤地迅速推进起来，使我们落后的农业中国成为先进的工业中国，然后我们的革命也才能算是真正的进行到了底。
    要完成这项神圣的任务，责任是很艰巨的。但我们一点也不气馁。有十月革命的成功给予我们无上的鼓励，有苏联人民三十二年来的宝贵经验给予我们崇高的模范，只要我们能够“团结一切力量”，不屈不挠地和帝国主义阵营的新战争挑拨者“斗争”，我们是一定能够完成任务的。
    我们全中国人民已经有了一个共同的誓愿。我们在国内一定要团结在毛主席和中国共产党的领导之下，励行人民民主专政，反对帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义，争取中国的独立、民主、和平、统一和富强。我们在国际上一定要“联合世界上一切爱好和平、自由的国家和人民，首先是联合苏联、各人民民主国家和各被压迫民族，站在国际和平民主阵营方面，共同反对帝国主义侵略，以保障世界的持久和平”。我们一定要用尽全力来实践这项誓愿，用行动和成绩来纪念伟大的十月革命，用行动和成绩来报答苏联人民的深厚友谊。
    我们谨以最大的热诚，向人类解放的前驱者，伟大的苏联人民，致兄弟的敬礼！
    伟大的十月社会主义革命万岁！
    世界和平的坚强堡垒——苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟万岁！
    伟大的布尔什维克党，列宁、斯大林的党万岁！
    马恩列斯主义和毛泽东思想胜利万岁！
    伟大的全人类的革命导师，斯大林大元帅万岁！
