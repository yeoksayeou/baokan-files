　　A Great Victory on the Health Front
    The plague in Inner Mongolia's Chabei region has been defeated. This is a great victory. When the plague outbreak was confirmed on October 26th, it immediately drew widespread and serious attention from both the Chahar province and the rest of North China. The State Council of the Central People's Government convened an emergency meeting on the 27th to decide on emergency prevention measures and established the Central Anti-Epidemic Committee, headed by Vice Premier Dong Biwu, to统lead the epidemic prevention work. By the beginning of this month, in less than half a month, the spread of the plague had been stopped. This serious disaster, just as it began, was met head-on and quickly contained.
    The plague has always been an extremely dangerous disaster for mankind, with a very high mortality rate. However, this time, the plague in Chabei, which could have caused enormous disasters and losses to the Chinese people, was defeated so quickly. This proves the strength of the people. This is a great victory for our people on the health front.
    The reason why the plague in Chabei was quickly defeated was due to the timely emergency measures taken by our own Central People's Government, and the high level of initiative and work efficiency displayed by the government workers and epidemic prevention personnel at all levels in North China. The Central Anti-Epidemic Committee mobilized more than a thousand epidemic prevention personnel and doctors, who worked intensively on the four lines of defense set up in the Chabei epidemic area and the Beijing-Tianjin quarantine area. In Zhangjiakou city, more than 160,000 people were vaccinated in one week, effectively preventing the spread of the plague.
    This victory was also due to the joint efforts of the army and the people in launching a comprehensive epidemic prevention campaign. The North China Military Region of the People's Liberation Army mobilized its troops to implement strict blockades. The Ministry of Railways temporarily suspended passenger and freight transport on the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway from Datong to Guihua. The people in areas neighboring the epidemic area launched mass epidemic prevention campaigns, including village-by-village and household-by-household blockades, as well as rat and flea extermination. The work of the village health committees and epidemic prevention teams has been very successful. Even in the Beijing and Tianjin quarantine areas, a widespread clean-up campaign, including rat and flea extermination, was launched. Only in this way could the plague be effectively stopped at the Ji'jiafangzi near Zhangjiakou and prevented from continuing to move south.
    Another important factor in the rapid victory over the plague in Chabei was the great assistance given to us by Soviet friends. Soviet medical experts Rogozin, Shakhtodovsky, Belosetseva, Mosinkova, and Maisky, who was formerly working in the Northeast and was called "the reborn mother" by the people of Rehe, and thirty-three other epidemic prevention personnel led by Hohlova, were invited by our Central Anti-Epidemic Committee to come to Beijing on the 4th and 5th of this month. After only a five-hour stay, they ignored the fatigue of the journey and rushed to Zhangjiakou day and night to carry out their work. A part of them arrived in Zhangbei on the 6th and then went to the Kangbao epidemic area.
    Before they arrived, sixty-eight people had died from the plague, but after they arrived, the two newly discovered patients were quickly cured, and no one else died. Now they have finished their work and returned home. We infinitely admire the great internationalist spirit of our Soviet friends, and we sincerely thank the friendly Soviet Union and Marshal Stalin for their love and support for the Chinese people.
    Now, this plague in Chabei, which could have caused enormous disasters and losses to the Chinese people, has been stopped under the wise leadership of the Central People's Government, the enthusiastic help of Soviet friends, and the joint efforts of our entire army and people. This fact makes us even more firmly convinced that, with the leadership of the Central People's Government headed by Chairman Mao, with the consolidated and close Sino-Soviet friendship, and with the full development of the power of the people, we have every possibility to overcome any difficulties and disasters. The construction of our new China will surely develop rapidly and achieve continuous victories!

### 卫生战线上一个伟大胜利

　　卫生战线上一个伟大胜利
    内蒙察北鼠疫是被战胜了。这是一个伟大的胜利。当着十月二十六日鼠疫侵袭的情况，得到证实以后，立即引起了察哈尔省及华北各地普遍的严重注意。中央人民政府政务院于二十七日召开紧急会议，决定了紧急防疫的措施，成立了中央防疫委员会，由董必武副总理任主任，统一领导防疫工作。至本月上旬，不及半个月，就已停止了鼠疫的蔓延，这一场严重的灾害，刚一开始，就遭受到迎头痛击而迅速地被停止蔓延了。
    鼠疫对于人类本来是极危险的灾害，它的死亡率很高，但是，这一次可能给予中国人民以巨大灾害与损失的察北鼠疫，竟然这样迅速地被我们所战胜，这证明了人民力量的强大，这是我国人民在卫生战线上的一次伟大胜利。
    此次察北鼠疫之所以迅速被战胜，是由于我国人民自己的中央人民政府及时地采取了紧急措施，和华北各级政府工作人员及防疫人员发扬了高度的积极性与工作效率的结果，在察北疫区和京津检疫区内所设立的四道封锁线上，中央防疫委员会曾调动了千余防疫人员和医生，紧张地工作，张家口市在一星期中注射疫苗者即达十六万人以上，有效地阻止了鼠疫的蔓延。
    这个胜利的获得还由于军民协力，展开了全面的防疫工作。人民解放军华北军区曾动员驻军，实施严格的封锁，铁道部一度隔绝了京绥路大同到归绥段的客货运输，邻近疫区各地人民开展了村村封锁，户户封锁以及捕鼠灭蚤的群众性防疫运动，各村卫生委员会与防疫小组的工作都有很大成绩，即在检疫区的京津两地也普遍地发动了捕鼠灭蚤等清洁运动，这样才能有效地使鼠疫停止在张家口附近的姬家房子，不能继续南侵。
    迅速战胜察北鼠疫的另一个重要因素，是苏联友人给予我们以伟大的援助。苏联医学专家罗果金、沙克多夫斯基、白洛塞杰娃、莫辛柯娃及原在东北工作的麦依斯基，曾被热河人民称为“再生的母亲”的霍荷洛娃等三十三位防疫人员，应我国中央防疫委员会的邀请，于本月四日、五日赶来北京，仅停留五小时，即不顾旅途疲劳，昼夜兼程，赶赴张家口进行工作，一部分又于六日到达张北转赴康保疫区。
    在他们到达以前因患鼠疫而死亡者有六十八人，而在他们到达之后，新发现的两名患者就被迅速治愈，再没有一个死亡的了。现在他们已经结束工作回国去了，我们对于苏联友人这种伟大的国际主义精神无限钦佩，我们更衷心感谢友邦苏联和斯大林大元帅对我国人民的热爱和支援。
    现在这一可能给予中国人民以巨大灾害与损失的察北鼠疫，已经在中央人民政府的英明领导，苏联友人的热诚帮助，和我们全体军民共同努力下被制止了。这一事实，使我们更坚定地确信，我们有着以毛主席为首的中央人民政府的领导，有着巩固而亲密的中苏友谊，充分发挥人民的力量，我们就有一切可能去战胜任何困难与灾害，我们新中国的建设事业一定能够迅速发展，获得不断的胜利！
