　　Chahar Province and Zhangjiakou City Epidemic Prevention Committees Merge
  　Centralizing and Unifying Epidemic Prevention Forces
    [Zhangjiakou, November 2nd, this newspaper] The Chahar Province Epidemic Prevention Committee held its fifth meeting yesterday and decided: 1. In order to centralize and unify epidemic prevention forces and improve organizational structure, it was decided to merge the Chahar Province and Zhangjiakou City Epidemic Prevention Committees. Under the Provincial Epidemic Prevention Committee, a blockade headquarters, an epidemic prevention department, a propaganda and organization department, a transportation department, a general affairs department, and a general office will be established. Each department will have a detailed division of labor and responsibilities. The epidemic prevention department will be divided into an epidemic prevention section (responsible for injections, examinations and autopsies, isolation and disinfection, burial, rat catching, etc.), a materials section (responsible for the supply and storage of medical equipment), a general office (responsible for collecting information, organizing materials, inspecting work, and convening meetings), and a propaganda and organization department (responsible for carrying out epidemic prevention propaganda to citizens and drawing up and allocating cadres needed for epidemic prevention work). In addition, an isolation hospital capable of accommodating 200 to 300 patients will be established. 2. All personnel in various agencies must first wear cloth socks reaching to the knees to prevent fleas, and widespread publicity is being carried out to popularize this to citizens. Because pneumonic plague bacteria are transmitted through the air, all cadres and citizens must wear qualified epidemic prevention masks and undergo strict inspections after a certain period; otherwise, they will be prohibited from going out. Several disinfection stations will be set up in the city to provide disinfection masks to passing pedestrians. 3. In order to prevent the spread of the epidemic, a ruthless and strict blockade will be implemented. People leaving the city must first register, be isolated at a designated location for nine days, and only be allowed to leave Zhangjiakou after it is confirmed that they have no symptoms and obtain a certain permit.

　　察省及张市防疫委员会合并
  　集中统一防疫力量
    【本报张家口二日专电】察省防疫委员会昨开第五次会议，决定：一、为了集中统一防疫力量与健全组织机构，决将察省、张市两防疫委员会合并，在省防疫委员会下，设封锁指挥部、防疫处、宣传组织处、交通处、总务处、办公厅。各部均周密的分工负责。防疫处分防疫科（负责注射、检验解剖、隔离消毒、掩埋、捕鼠等事宜）、材料科（负责供应与保管医药器材）、办公厅（负责搜集情报整理材料、检查工作、召集会议）、宣传组织处（负责向市民作防疫宣传与抽调配备防疫工作中需要的干部），此外并设能容二百到三百病人的隔离病院。二、各机关人员首先一律穿高及膝盖的布袜子，以防跳蚤，并正广泛宣传，以求普及到市民。因肺鼠疫菌借空气传染，干部、市民一律戴合乎规定的防疫口罩，过一定时间实行严格检查，否则禁止其外出。在市内设数个消毒站，发给来往行人消毒口罩。三、为防止病疫传播，决作无情的严格封锁，出境人员需先经过登记，到指定地点隔离九天，确无病症发现与取得一定执照后，方可离张。
