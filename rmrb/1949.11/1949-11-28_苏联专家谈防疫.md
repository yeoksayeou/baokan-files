　　Soviet Expert Talks About Epidemic Prevention
	Our correspondent in Zhang, Lü Guangming

　　Soviet medical expert Dr. Rakson and Soviet Anti-Epidemic Team representative Maisky, who personally went to Chahar League and North Chahar to investigate the epidemic situation, talked about the results of their investigation in the epidemic area at the Chahar Provincial Anti-Epidemic Committee before leaving Zhangjiakou, and put forward suggestions for future epidemic prevention work.

　　According to Dr. Rakson, judging from the work reports of Fan and Hu, the captains of the second and third detachments of the Central Anti-Epidemic Team, and the doctors in Kangbao City and Longwang Temple (Chahar League), the previous saying that "the plague of 'Chahan Bengbeng' came from the grasslands of Inner Mongolia" may not be accurate. Because Chahan Bengbeng is surrounded by grasslands and there are many rats, the households that got sick are close to the edge of the village, so it should be a primary plague. Moreover, the village is located between 45 and 50 degrees north latitude, which used to be a plague-prone area.

　　Talking about future tasks, Dr. Rakson suggested that in order to completely eliminate the primary plague in Chahan Bengbeng, the two anti-epidemic teams currently stationed in Chahar League and North Chahar should not be withdrawn before December 20. After the withdrawal, permanent epidemic prevention workers should be left behind. The plague in Ji's house in Zhangjiakou was transmitted, so the village should also be equipped with considerable epidemic prevention force. Preparations should be made in advance, and the anti-epidemic team should be sent to various epidemic areas to work earlier next spring. At the end of March and the beginning of April, rats and fleas will begin to be active, so timely inspection and testing should be carried out to see if there are any bacteria-carrying rats; prepare early for prevention. In some areas of Chahar League and North Chahar, some epidemic households' houses and items were burned in the past, and dogs and cats were generally beaten in epidemic villages and their surroundings. This unscientific method violates the interests of the masses and is divorced from the masses. Not only can it not stop the spread of the plague, but it also causes fear among the masses and hinders the research on the epidemic situation. We can no longer follow this method. We must use scientific methods: blockade, isolation, and medical disinfection.

　　Representative Maisky talked about the basic methods of epidemic prevention, saying: First, we must always pay attention to the health of the people, and the health committee members and health team leaders in streets and villages must take responsibility. In areas where anti-epidemic teams are stationed, short-term training classes should be held before withdrawal to continue the anti-epidemic work. The second is to eliminate rats and fleas. Rat catching should be carried out in both epidemic and non-epidemic areas. A female rat can give birth to 10 to 18 pups at a time. Eliminating one rat in the spring is equivalent to eliminating one hundred in the autumn. All localities should manufacture a large number of rat-catching equipment and rat poison. All epidemic villages should dig rat-proof ditches, and rat-catching teams should be organized, because areas that were infected this year may be primary areas next year. The third is to create a mass epidemic prevention movement, and we must strengthen propaganda and education work. The masses like to listen to our anti-epidemic lectures, because it is related to their vital interests. Experience has proved that the mass sanitation work in areas where the plague has occurred is much better than before. All people who go out from epidemic villages must be inspected. It is wrong for various localities not to take in people from epidemic villages. They should be properly isolated and resettled. If they do not get sick after nine days of isolation, they should be allowed to move freely. Because if there is no place to resettle people from epidemic villages, they may get sick and die on the way; or they may run around and spread the epidemic more.

　　He hoped that from December this year to March next year, Chahar Province would train all local medical and epidemic prevention personnel for a short period of ten to twenty days, so that they can learn new scientific epidemic prevention methods. A general injection of live bacteria vaccine should be given in Chahar League, Kangbao, Baoyuan, Zhangbei, Zhangjiakou, Ji's house, and along the way from Zhangjiakou to Chahan Bengbeng in March and April next year. Kangbao and Zhangjiakou should have permanent isolation hospitals and laboratories, and should conduct regular research on bacteria-carrying rats, so as to discover and prevent them at any time.

### 苏联专家谈防疫

　　苏联专家谈防疫
    本报驻张记者  吕光明
    曾亲赴察盟、察北考察疫情的苏联医学专家拉克森博士、苏联防疫总队代表麦依斯基等，在离开张市之前，曾在察省防疫委员会上谈述赴疫区考察结果，并对今后防疫工作提出建议。
    据拉克森博士谈，根据在康保城、龙王庙（察盟）两地听取的中央防疫队二、三中队范、胡两中队长及医生们的工作报告来判断，以前传说“察汉崩崩的鼠疫是从内蒙草地传来的”不一定确实，因为察汉崩崩四面靠草地，老鼠很多，发病户都靠着村边原野，应是一种原发性的鼠疫。而且该村处在北纬四十五度到五十度之间，曾为发生鼠疫的地带。
    谈到今后的任务，拉克森博士建议为了彻底消灭察汉崩崩的原发性鼠疫，现留察盟、察北的两个防疫队，在十二月二十日以前不撤出。撤出后还要留下经常的防疫工作人员，张市姬家房子的鼠疫是传来的，该村也要配置相当防疫力量。并应事先准备，来年春天早些派防疫队前往各疫区工作。三月末四月初，鼠、蚤将开始活动，应及时检查化验是否有保菌的老鼠；早为防备。在察盟、察北某些地方，过去曾烧了一些疫户房屋、物品，疫村及其附近普遍打狗打猫，这种非科学的方法，违反群众利益，脱离群众，不独不能制止鼠疫传染，反而引起群众恐惧，妨碍了疫情的研究。这种方法，我们再不能沿用，我们要用科学的方法：封锁、隔离、医药消毒。
    麦依斯基代表谈防疫的基本方法说：第一是经常注意到老百姓的健康，街、村里的卫生委员、卫生小组长要负起责任；凡有防疫队驻在的地区，在撤出之前，要办些短期训练班，以继续作防疫工作。第二是消灭鼠、蚤，在发疫与未发疫过的地区，都应作捕鼠工作，一个母鼠一次能生十个到十八个小鼠，春天消灭一个老鼠等于秋天消灭一百个，各地应大量制造捕鼠器械与毒鼠药，所有疫村都应挖防鼠沟，并应组织捕鼠队，因为今年被感染的地区，来年也许就是原发地区。第三是造成群众性的防疫运动，必须加强宣传教育工作。群众很喜欢听我们的防疫讲演，因为这关系到他的切身利益。经验证明：凡发生过鼠疫地区的群众卫生工作，与以前比较，却不知好了多少倍。凡从疫村外出的人，都要经过检查。各地不收容从疫村的来人是错误的，应妥善隔离安置，隔离九天如不发病，就应允其自由行动。因为如果对疫村来人无安置的地方，他们也许会患病死在途中；或则东奔西跑，更能散布疫病。
    他希望察省从今年十二月到明年三月，把所有的地方上的医务、防疫人员，都经过十天到二十天的短期训练，使他们学会新的科学防疫方法。察盟、康保、宝源、张北、张家口、姬家房子及张市至察汉崩崩的沿途，在明年三、四月间，都应普遍注射一次生菌疫苗。康保、张市应常设隔离病院和化验室，并经常进行鼠类保菌研究工作，以便随时发现随时防治。
