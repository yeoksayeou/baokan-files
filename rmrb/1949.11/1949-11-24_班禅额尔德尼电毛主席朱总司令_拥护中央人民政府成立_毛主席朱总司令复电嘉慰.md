Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 23rd: Panchen Erdeni, currently residing in Qinghai, sent a telegram to Chairman Mao Zedong and Commander-in-Chief Zhu De after the liberation of Qinghai, expressing his support for the Central People's Government. Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu have now replied with a message of commendation. The exchange of telegrams is as follows:

(1) Panchen's telegram to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu: To Chairman Mao, Chairman of the Central People's Government, and Zhu De, Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Beijing:

Your Excellencies, with great wisdom and courage, have achieved the cause of saving the nation and its people. Wherever the righteous army goes, the whole country rejoices. Panchen has received national favor and high respect for generations. For more than twenty years, I have been appealing and working tirelessly for the integrity of Tibet's territory and sovereignty. However, I have been burdened with guilt because I have not achieved any results. I am currently staying in Qinghai, awaiting orders to return to Tibet. Fortunately, under your leadership, the Northwest has been liberated, and the Central People's Government has been established, which all Chinese people applaud. From now on, the happiness and well-being of the people can be expected, and the rejuvenation of the country is hopeful. The liberation of Tibet is just around the corner. Panchen respectfully represents all the people of Tibet in extending the highest and most sincere respect to Your Excellencies, and expresses my sincere support and love.

Panchen Erdeni bows, October 1st.

(2) Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu's reply to Mr. Panchen Erdeni:

We were very pleased to receive your telegram of October 1st. The Tibetan people love their motherland and oppose foreign aggression. They are dissatisfied with the policies of the Kuomintang reactionary government and are willing to become a member of the unified, prosperous, and equal new Chinese family of nationalities cooperating together. The Central People's Government and the Chinese People's Liberation Army will certainly satisfy this wish of the Tibetan people. It is hoped that you and all patriotic people in Tibet will work together for the liberation of Tibet and the unity of the Han and Tibetan peoples.
