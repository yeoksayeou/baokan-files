Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 29th: According to TASS, New York: The UN General Assembly plenary meeting on November 22nd discussed the issue of approving new UN member states and the establishment of the so-called "Field Service" and "Field Observer Reserve." At the meeting, the US-UK bloc continued to pursue its discriminatory policy against the People's Democracies of Albania, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, and Mongolia, and passed the Australian proposal that had previously been adopted by the Special Political Committee. This proposal requires the Security Council to re-examine the applications submitted by Italy, Portugal, Transjordan, Nepal, Ireland, Finland, Ceylon, Austria, and the South Korean puppet regime, while excluding the aforementioned People's Democracies. The Soviet compromise proposal, which was to approve the admission of all thirteen countries except South Korea to the United Nations, was rejected. The actions of the US-UK bloc have kept the United Nations in a continued stalemate. On the same day, the plenary meeting passed the proposal to establish the so-called "Field Service" and "Field Observer Reserve" under the UN Secretariat, which has the characteristics of a purely military organization. The Soviet representative, Tsarapkin, solemnly pointed out that the establishment of such an organization under the UN Secretariat is a complete violation of the UN Charter. Because the UN Charter only stipulates that the Security Council is entrusted with the primary responsibility for maintaining world peace and security, the so-called "Field Service" and "Field Observer Reserve" established under the Secretariat are in fact armed forces, and this should not fall within the authority of the UN Secretary-General at all. However, the majority of the US-UK bloc once again passed a decision that greatly violates the UN Charter.

　　美英操纵表决机器
  　联大又通过两反动决议
    【新华社北京二十九日电】据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会十一月二十二日全体会议，讨论了批准联合国新会员国的问题与成立所谓“外勤队”和“外勤观察员后备队”的问题。会上美英集团继续奉行其对阿尔巴尼亚、保加利亚、罗马尼亚、匈牙利和蒙古各人民民主国家的歧视政策，通过了前已在特别政治委员会通过的澳大利亚提案。这个提案要求安全理事会重行审查意大利、葡萄牙、外约旦、尼泊尔、爱尔兰、芬兰、锡兰、奥地利与南朝鲜傀儡政权所提出的申请，而把上述人民民主国家摒除在外。苏联的折衷提案，即批准除南朝鲜以外十三国全部加入联合国，则竟遭否决。美英集团的行动，使联合国继续陷于僵局。同日全体会议通过了在联合国秘书处之下，成立具有纯粹军事组织的特色的所谓“外勤队”和“外勤观察员后备队”的提案。苏联代表查拉普金严正指出，在联合国秘书处之下成立这样的组织是完全违反联合国宪章的。因为联合国宪章只规定赋予安理会以维持世界和平与安全的主要责任，在秘书处之下成立的所谓“外勤队”与“外勤观察员后备队”，实际上就是武装部队，而这是完全不应属于联合国秘书长的权限以内的。但美英集团的多数，又一次通过了大为违犯联合国宪章的决定。
