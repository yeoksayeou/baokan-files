　　Introduction to the Asian and Australian Trade Union Conference
    The Asian and Australian Trade Union Conference will soon begin in Beijing. This conference includes representatives of the working class from various countries in Asia and Australia. It is an unprecedented meeting of great unity for the working class of Asia and Australia, and also a meeting of great unity between the working class of Asia and Australia and the world's working class. This conference will be held under the direct leadership of the Executive Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions, and will hear a report from Louis Saillant, Secretary-General of the World Federation of Trade Unions, on the world workers' movement, as well as reports from trade unions in various Asian and Australian countries. In addition, the delegates will discuss various methods for carrying out the workers' movement, adopt various resolutions, and, under the leadership of the progressive and democratic World Federation of Trade Unions, more powerfully carry out the workers' movement in Asian and Australian countries, and completely unite the Asian and Australian working class. We know that the working class and the broad masses of people in Asia and Australia are subjected to cruel oppression and exploitation under the rule of imperialist aggressive forces and reactionary forces. Imperialism dreams of permanently enslaving the people of the colonies, using the manpower and material resources of these colonies as capital for launching new wars. Within many countries in Asia and Australia, they have created many reactionary labor laws and established many reactionary yellow trade unions. The reactionary forces within various colonial countries collude with imperialists to carry out reactionary rule and oppression domestically. Therefore, the tasks facing the working class of Asia and Australia are very arduous. The upcoming Asian and Australian Trade Union Conference will address this situation, under the overall goal of opposing imperialism, opposing feudalism, opposing wars of aggression, opposing splitters of the world workers' movement, defending world peace, striving for national independence of oppressed countries, safeguarding the democratic rights of trade unions, and defending the unity of the world workers' movement. At the same time, it will provide an opportunity for countries that have already achieved independence and liberation to exchange experiences in production and construction.
    How was such a conference initiated and prepared? It was in 1947 that the representative from Siam attending the World Federation of Trade Unions suggested convening an Asian Trade Union Conference, which was discussed and approved by the World Federation of Trade Unions. At that time, the reactionary trade union bosses of American and British imperialism had not yet withdrawn from the World Federation of Trade Unions. They wanted to make trouble within the World Federation of Trade Unions, undermine the World Federation of Trade Unions, and obstruct the unity of the working class around the world. Therefore, they outwardly agreed to convene the Asian Trade Union Conference, but actually obstructed the convening of the Asian Trade Union Conference in every way. Later, under the efforts and support of the Soviet Trade Unions and under the leadership of Saillant, Secretary-General of the World Federation of Trade Unions, the World Federation of Trade Unions, disregarding the sabotage of British and American imperialism, decided to convene this conference in China in 1949 and entrusted Comrade Liu Ningyi, the representative of our country attending the World Federation of Trade Unions, to be responsible for the preparation. In May of this year, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions convened an enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee to discuss the issue of convening the Asian Trade Union Conference. At the meeting, everyone unanimously and warmly welcomed this decision of the World Federation of Trade Unions. In June of this year, at the Second Congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions, our Chinese delegation to the World Federation of Trade Unions suggested to the World Federation of Trade Unions that the Asian Trade Union Conference be held in Beijing, the capital of New China, in November of this year. Democratic trade union representatives from all countries in Asia, whether they have joined the World Federation of Trade Unions or not, should be invited to participate in this conference. We also suggested inviting representatives from democratic trade unions in Australia and New Zealand to attend, because geographically and traditionally, there is a very close connection between the working people of Australia and the Asian workers' movement. Their participation in the conference will certainly make a great contribution. At the same time, we also suggested that the World Federation of Trade Unions, in order to prepare for the timely convening of this conference, must immediately dispatch representatives of the World Federation of Trade Unions to China to be responsible for the preparation after the completion of the Second Congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions. The World Federation of Trade Unions fully agreed to our suggestion, renamed this meeting the Asian and Australian Trade Union Conference, and decided to begin holding it on November 16th of this year. Now the preparatory work for this conference has been completed under the guidance of the World Federation of Trade Unions.
    The countries participating in the Asian and Australian Trade Union Conference in Asia include China, India, Japan, Outer Mongolia, Korea, the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaya, Siam, Burma, Vietnam, Ceylon, Palestine, Iran, Lebanon, Syria, Cyprus, and other countries, as well as the republics of Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan in the Asian part of the Soviet Union; in Australia, there are Australia and New Zealand. Most of the representatives of these countries have already arrived in Beijing, but there are still representatives of several countries who are being obstructed by imperialists or domestic reactionary governments and have not yet arrived. For example, the Indonesian General Federation of Trade Unions decided at a plenary meeting of representatives to send representatives to participate in the Asian and Australian Trade Union Conference, but the Indonesian reactionary traitorous government of the Hatta group has done everything possible to obstruct the Indonesian General Federation of Trade Unions delegation from coming to Beijing. Although they have been obstructed, according to a New China News Agency dispatch from Beijing on the 13th, the Indonesian General Federation of Trade Unions delegation appointed to attend the Asian and Australian Trade Union Conference is still trying to come to Beijing. It can be affirmed that even if imperialists and reactionaries obstruct representatives from coming to Beijing to participate in the conference, the spirit of the Asian and Australian Trade Union Conference and everything resolved at the conference will soon be spread to various countries. Imperialists and domestic reactionaries cannot obstruct the unity of Asian and Australian workers and the unity of the world proletariat.
    Such a grand international working-class conference can be held in our capital—Beijing—as a result of the victory of our Chinese people's revolution. This is a great honor for our Chinese working class and will be of great help to our Chinese workers' movement. Our Chinese working class should recognize that this conference is a conference of the world working class against wars of aggression, defending peace, striving for the independence and liberation of colonies and dependent countries, opposing splitters of the world workers' movement, safeguarding the democratic rights of trade unions, and promoting the unity of the world workers' movement. Our Chinese working class must recognize that the victory of the struggles of the Asian and Australian working class is the victory of our Chinese working class, and also the great victory of the world's working class. Therefore, our Chinese working class should pay close attention to the progress of the Asian and Australian Trade Union Conference, fully support this conference, and fulfill all resolutions in support of this conference. At the same time, we should sincerely express our condolences and welcome to the representatives from various countries who have come from afar to participate in this conference.

　　介绍亚洲、澳洲工会会议
    亚、澳洲工会会议很快就要在北京开始举行了。这一个会议包括了亚洲、澳洲各个国家工人阶级的代表，是亚洲澳洲工人阶级空前大团结的会议，也是亚洲澳洲工人阶级和世界工人阶级大团结的一个会议。这个会将在世界工会联合会执行局直接领导下举行，听取世界工联总书记路易·赛扬关于世界工人运动的报告，和亚洲澳洲各个国家工会的报告。另外，代表们还要商量开展工人运动的各种办法，通过各种决议，在进步的、民主的世界工会联合会的领导下，更有力地来开展亚洲和澳洲各国的工人运动，把亚洲澳洲工人阶级，完全团结起来。我们知道亚洲澳洲的工人阶级和广大人民在帝国主义侵略势力和反动势力统治下，受到残酷的压迫和剥削。帝国主义梦想长期奴役殖民地的人民，利用这些殖民地的人力和物力，作为发动新战争的资本。他们在亚洲澳洲许多国家内，制造了很多反动的劳动法令，成立了很多反动的黄色工会。各个殖民地国家内部的反动势力，勾结帝国主义者在国内进行反动统治和压迫。因此摆在亚洲澳洲工人阶级面前的任务是很艰巨的。很快就要举行的亚、澳洲工会会议，就要针对着这种情况，在反对帝国主义、反对封建主义、反对侵略战争、反对世界工人运动的分裂者，保卫世界和平，争取被压迫国家的民族独立、捍卫工会民主权利和捍卫世界工运统一的总目标下进行，同时使已经获得独立和解放的国家得到交流生产建设经验的机会。
    这样一个大会是怎样发起和筹备的呢？那是在一九四七年，由暹逻出席世界工联的代表建议召开亚洲工会会议，由世界工联讨论通过的。在那一次会议上，美国、英国帝国主义的反动工会头子还没有退出世界工联，那时他们想在世界工联内部捣乱，把世界工联搞垮，阻挠全世界工人阶级的团结，所以他们在表面上赞成召开亚洲工会会议，实际上处处阻挠亚洲工会会议的召集，后来世界工联在苏联职工会的努力支持和在世界工联总书记赛扬的领导下，不顾英美帝国主义的捣乱，决定在一九四九年在中国召开这个会议并且委托我国出席世界工联代表刘宁一同志负责进行筹备，到今年五月中华全国总工会又召开了常务委员会扩大会议，讨论了关于召开亚洲工会会议的问题，会上大家一致热烈欢迎世界工联的这一个决定。今年六月间，世界工联第二届代表大会上我们中国出席世界工联职工代表团向世界工联建议，亚洲工会会议，在今年十一月间在新中国首都北京举行，亚洲一切国家的民主工会代表，不论是否已经加入世界工联，都应该邀请他们参加这个会议，我们还建议邀请澳洲和新西兰的民主工会代表前来参加，因为在地理上，在传统上，澳洲的劳动人民和亚洲工人运动之间，有着很密切的联系，他们来参加大会，一定能有很大的贡献，同时我们还建议世界工联，为了准备这个大会如期召开，必须在世界工联二届大会完了以后，立刻派遣世界工联的代表到中国来负责筹备。世界工联完全同意了我们的建议，把这个会改称为亚、澳洲工会会议，并且决定在今年十一月十六日起开始举行，现在这个大会的筹备工作在世界工联的指导下，已经完成。
    参加亚、澳工会会议的国家在亚洲有中国、印度、日本、外蒙古、朝鲜、菲律宾、印尼、马来亚、暹逻、缅甸、越南、锡兰、巴勒斯坦、伊朗、黎巴嫩、叙利亚、塞普鲁士等国家，和苏联亚洲部分的阿塞尔拜疆、哈萨克、吉尔吉斯、土克明尼亚、乌兹贝克、达吉克斯坦等几个共和国；在澳洲有澳大利亚和新西兰等。这些国家的代表，大部分已经来到北京，不过还有几个国家的代表，现在正受着帝国主义者，或是国内反动政府的阻挠，到现在没有到达，例如印尼总工会在全体代表会议上决定要派代表来参加亚、澳洲工会会议，但是印尼的反动卖国政府哈达集团就尽其一切可能阻挠印尼总工会代表团到北京来，他们虽然受到了阻挠，但是根据新华社北京十三号的电讯，印尼总工会委派出席亚、澳洲工会会议代表团仍然正在设法到北京来。可以肯定的，即使帝国主义者，反动派阻挠了代表来北京参加会议，但是亚、澳工会会议的精神和会上所决议的一切事项，不久将仍然要传播到各个国家里去，对于亚、澳工人的团结和全世界无产阶级的团结，帝国主义者和各国国内反动派是无法阻挠的。
    这样一个盛大的国际工人阶级的会议，能够在我们的首都——北京召开，这是由于我们中国人民革命获得了胜利的结果，这对于我们中国工人阶级是一个莫大的光荣，对于我们中国工人运动会有很大的帮助。我们中国工人阶级应该认识到这一个会议是全世界工人阶级反侵略战争、保卫和平、争取殖民地和附属国独立解放、反对世界工人运动的分裂者、保卫工会民主权利和世界工运统一的大会，我们中国工人阶级必须认识到亚洲澳洲工人阶级的斗争胜利，就是我们中国工人阶级的胜利，也就是全世界工人阶级的大胜利。所以我们中国工人阶级应该密切地注意亚、澳洲工会会议进行的情形，应该完全支持这个会议，并且完成拥护这个会议的一切决议。同时对于远道来参加这个会议的各国代表，竭诚表示慰问和欢迎。
