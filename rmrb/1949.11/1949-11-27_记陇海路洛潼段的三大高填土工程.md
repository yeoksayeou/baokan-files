　　Record of the Three Major High Embankment Projects on the Luoyang-Tongguan Section of the Longhai Railway
    Wu Dazhong
    On the Luoyang-Tongguan section of the Longhai Railway, fifteen kilometers east of Shanzhou, there are three large bridges, almost connected, with extremely dangerous terrain. Beneath the bridges are deep valleys of precipitous cliffs, and beside them is the roaring Jian River. This is the famous high embankment project, one of the three major difficult projects on the Luoyang-Tongguan section of the Longhai Railway.

    The three bridges were initially built in the fourteenth year of the Republic of China [1925], originally supported by high steel towers and steel plate girders. In the second year of the all-out civil war launched by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, they were completely destroyed in the war. The steel girders were shattered and overturned at the bottom of the river, the high steel towers were broken in half and lay supine on the riverbank, the bridge abutments were blasted, and the locomotives and carriages were overturned on the hillside, half-buried under thick layers of accumulated soil.

    As the great People's Liberation War was achieving a decisive victory throughout the country, repairing the Longhai Railway, this vital east-west artery, to rapidly liberate and develop the Great Northwest, became an urgent and pressing task. The Revolutionary Military Commission issued an order to quickly repair the Luoyang-Tongguan section. Given the extreme shortage of steel girders and the inconvenience and difficulty of transportation, repairing these three arduous bridge projects was certainly not a simple or easy task. After repeated surveys and measurements by the technical department of the Railway Corps, it was decided to adopt a "once and for all" "earth" method, using manpower to open mountains, dig soil, and fill it in. This massive high embankment project, requiring more than 319,000 cubic meters of earth, fell on the shoulders of the Railway Corps and the people of western Henan.

    I. Completing the High Embankment and Repairing the Longhai Railway

    The Luoyang-Tongguan Section Engineering Committee was quickly established under the personal leadership of Chairman Wu Zhipu of Henan Province. Under the powerful slogan of "Complete the high embankment, repair the Longhai Railway, build a new Henan, and liberate the Great Northwest," 12,000 civilian laborers from four counties and one city in western Henan—Shanxian, Yiyang, Mianchi, Xin'an, and Luoyang—voluntarily signed up to join this construction effort. The various repair armies arrived at the construction site one after another in mid-August, ready and waiting. The groundbreaking ceremony was held on August 22nd. The Engineering Committee promptly decided that the 27th Line Brigade of the Railway Corps would be responsible for the technical guidance and construction of culverts, cutting down bridge towers, and removing bridges, while all the embankment work would be undertaken by the civilian laborers. The civilian laborers were organized into four detachments and one brigade, each responsible for the embankment work on the three bridges. The majority of the civilian laborers were farmers who had been liberated for about a year, and newly organized urban poor, independent laborers, dockworkers, and small vendors. Although their backgrounds were different and their awareness was not yet uniform, they united under the same goal and slogan, participating in the great work of building the people's motherland with high labor enthusiasm and initiative.

    II. A Great Symphony of Labor

    The heroic soldiers of the Railway Corps, under the difficult conditions of inconvenient transportation and extreme shortage of materials, first undertook the arduous task of building three culverts. They fully understood the civilian laborers' desire to "start early, finish early, and return home for the autumn harvest and wheat planting," and under the leadership's call to "not delay the civilian laborers' embankment work," they worked hard day and night in the valley despite the hot weather and intermittent rain. Carrying over a hundred pounds of sleepers on their shoulders, they raced along the steep valley slopes to the bottom, building hexagonal sleeper frames one by one along the direction of the water flow, covering them with wooden planks, and constructing three temporary culverts. Soil continuously rolled down from the steep slopes. A slight breeze blew dust all over the soldiers' faces, and grains of sand filled their mouths. Hot sweat soaked their clothes and formed mud. Sudden rainstorms came, and the entire gully was filled with muddy water. Everyone worked in the mud, turning into mud people. Their eyes became bloodshot, their voices hoarse, their clothes torn, and their shoes lost, but they continued to work. The soldiers stubbornly completed the entire work of erecting the culverts in a week of intense labor, laying a solid foundation for the entire project. The embankment work began, and a great scene of labor immediately unfolded before everyone. On and under the bridges, thousands of laborers, like soldiers charging into battle, pushed and squeezed each other, working in a flurry. The crowds carrying soil spread out like long snake formations, running busily up and down, back and forth. Those with heavy loads rushed forward with effort, those with light loads ran with swift strides. The front called to the back, the back urged the front. The sound of the loudspeaker broadcasts, the shouts of mutual encouragement and summoning, immediately converged with the sound of mattocks, hoes, shovels, and stones and clods of earth colliding with each other, forming a great symphony of labor that stirred and echoed throughout the valley day and night, regardless of sunny or rainy weather. At night, the motors started, and high-intensity electric lights, gaslights, and carbide lamps emitted a dazzling light on the construction sites on both banks of the three bridges. The night on the bridgehead was like a night market in a metropolis, with shadows of people constantly moving back and forth. During the season around the Mid-Autumn Festival, the civilian laborers wore thin single layers of clothing, and the north wind frequently crossed the mountains and attacked the valley, causing people to shiver all over when they stopped working. Everyone proposed, "Work faster, carry more, and avoid shivering from the cold." One closely followed another, one row followed another, running back and forth. Many people stumbled in the dim light, but quickly got up and rushed on, until they were sweating profusely and their clothes were soaked through. Only when they saw the yellow earth accumulating layer upon layer did a victorious smile appear on their faces.

    III. Striving for Quality in Speed, Striving for Speed in Quality, Compacting the Roadbed, Ensuring Safe Traffic

    In order to make the roadbed solid and durable and ensure safe traffic, it was necessary to spray water and tamp it once every 40-50 centimeters of embankment, so that it would solidify. Therefore, the Engineering Committee proposed the slogan "Strive for quality in speed, strive for speed in quality, compact the roadbed, ensure safe traffic." It received a resounding response from the civilian laborers. The detachments organized tamping teams, and under the leadership of the Railway Corps soldiers, thousands of tamping teams sang in unison, "Raise the ram high! Tamp it deep and well! Everyone work hard! Build this great bridge well!..." The sound of tamping and singing resounded like spring thunder through the mountains and fields of western Henan.

    IV. Everyone is Involved in Revolutionary Competition

    As work progressed, a vigorous campaign of challenging and competing for red flags and model workers unfolded, and everyone was swept up in this upsurge of revolutionary heroism. Everyone was inspired by the slogan "Be a labor hero by building the bridge, be a liberated hero by returning home." Initially, carrying 70 loads of soil per day was considered the highest achievement, but in the competition, labor hero Li Fangshun quickly rose to 120 loads, and civilian laborer Zhang Haichuan increased from 70 loads to 90 loads, then 100 loads. The Second Team of the Second Brigade in Luoyang filled 790 cubic meters of soil in one day, and a five-person work group in Xin'an carried 2.5 cubic meters of soil per person per day. When the news of the founding of the New China reached the construction site, the civilian laborers welcomed it with unparalleled joy. They unanimously proposed "Completing the high embankment ahead of schedule as a gift to Chairman Mao and the New China." Everyone doubled their efforts. Little labor hero Xue Xi increased from 70 loads to 120 loads, and finally to 170 loads, within a distance of 120 meters. Civilian laborer model Guo Fengde even created an amazing record of carrying 194 loads of soil per day. In response to the call of the Central China Bureau and the Provincial Party Committee for a campaign of simplification and economy, the civilian laborer cadres launched a "Hundred Loads of Soil Movement," calling on every cadre and service personnel to carry 100 loads of soil, and detachments in Shanzhou, Xin'an, and other places quickly responded, saving the public 20,000 to 30,000 catties of wheat in wages. The Xin'an Detachment launched a "Three Loads of Soil Movement," carrying three extra loads of soil every day after work, which quickly spread to other bridgeheads. They also launched a "Full Basket Movement," not leaving until the basket was full. In response to the Engineering Committee's requirement to "improve quality and ensure a solid roadbed," the Mianchi Detachment launched a "One Stone for the Foundation Movement," with each person carrying a large stone on their back when going to work across the river and filling it into the roadbed. The Xin'an Detachment launched a "Gathering Grass to Protect the Slope Movement," collecting various weeds such as *maling* grass and creeping vines when taking a walk and washing their faces every day, storing them in damp places, and taking them out to plant when repairing side slopes, strengthening soil cohesion and making the roadbed durable.

    V. A People's University

    Thanks to the active efforts of local Party and civilian laborer cadres, the entire high embankment project became a people's university, and the construction site became a political classroom for the civilian laborers. Because political work was carried out among the civilian laborers, they strictly observed the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention of the People's Liberation Army, camping out on the streets when they could not find lodging and not disturbing the masses when cooking and drinking water. When leaving the construction site, an inspection team was established to compensate for any damage. After arriving at the construction site, they immediately put forward the three major requirements of "eating well (no raw or cold food), sleeping well (regular rest), and playing well (conducting recreational activities)." Cadres seized every opportunity to conduct class education on suppressing bandits, opposing local bullies, demanding liberation, and making revolution among the civilian laborers through collective lessons, separate lectures in cave dwellings, and individual talks, raising the consciousness of the civilian laborers. They also launched extensive recreational activities, organized amateur propaganda teams, and published the *Repair Bridge Express*. Each bridgehead published a *xi bao* (using two wooden sticks to prop up a mat and insert it on the construction site), and each team learned a dozen or so songs. The construction site, cave dwellings, and the march to and from work were filled with cheerful singing all day long.

    VI. A Milestone in the Construction of New China

    The high embankment project of 319,000 cubic meters was completed on October 20th after day and night rush repairs. The soldiers of the Railway Corps and the 12,000 civilian laborers created the amazing miracle of "leveling mountains and filling valleys" with their shoulders and hands. On the day of the completion ceremony, a tall monument was erected at Jiaokou Station. This is the crystallization of the blood and sweat of tens of thousands of working people, and also a milestone in the construction of New China. (Photos attached)

　　记陇海路洛潼段的三大高填土工程
    吴大中
    陇海铁路，洛潼段上，陕州以东十五公里处有三座几乎相连起来而形势极端险要的高大桥梁。桥下面是断崖绝壁的深谷，旁边是涛涛巨流的涧河，这就是有名的陇海路洛潼段三大险工之一的高填土工程了。
    三桥初建于民国十四年，原用高架钢塔支承钢板梁。当蒋匪发动全面内战的第二年，在战争中遭到了全部破坏，钢梁支离破碎的翻倒在河底，高架钢塔拦腰折断仰卧在河岸上，桥台炸塌了，车头和车皮仰面朝天的翻倒在山坡上，被厚厚地积土埋上了大半截。
    当伟大的人民解放战争在全国范围内已经取得决定性胜利的时候，为了迅速解放大西北，开发大西北，修通这条横贯东西的大动脉——陇海路，已经成为急不可待的迫切任务了。革命军事委员会下达了迅速抢修洛潼段的命令。在目前钢梁极度缺乏与交通不便运输困难条件下，修复这三座艰巨的桥梁工程，确实不是一个简单而容易的工作。经铁道兵团技术部门反复勘察测量结果，决定采取“一劳永逸”的“土”办法，用人力开山掘土填死它，这个需用三十一万九千余立方公尺的浩大高填土工程，就落在铁道兵团和豫西人民的肩上了。
    一、完成高填土，修通陇海路
    洛潼段的工程委员会，在河南省吴芝圃主席亲自主持下，很快就成立了。在“完成高填土，修通陇海路，建设新河南，解放大西北。”的有力号召下，豫西陕县、宜阳、渑池、新安、洛阳等四县一市一万二千民工，自动报名参加了这一建设行列。各路抢修大军，浩浩荡荡于八月中旬先后到达工地，集中待命。八月二十二日举行开工典礼。工程委员会及时决定由铁道兵团第二十七线路大队担任工程中的技术指导及建设涵洞，切断桥塔，起出桥梁等工作，全部填土工作则由民工负担。民工编成四个支队一个大队，分别担当三桥的填土工作。民工中大部分成份是解放了一年左右的农民和刚刚组织起来的城市贫民，独立劳动者，装卸工人，小商贩。仅管他们的出身不同，觉悟还没有一致，但他们却在这同一目标和号召下团结起来以高度的劳动热情与积极性参加了建设人民祖国的伟大工作。
    二、一片巨大劳动的音响
    铁道兵团的英勇战士们，在交通不便材料奇缺的困难条件下，首先担负起修造三座涵洞的艰巨工程。他们并充分体会到民工们盼望“早做，早完，回家秋收种麦”急待开工的心里，在首长们“不误民工填土”的号召下，冒着炎热的天气与间歇的阴雨，日以继夜的在涧谷里苦干起来。他们肩抗着一百多斤的枕木，沿着高陡的谷坡，飞跑奔向谷底，顺着水流方向，建造起一个个正六角形的枕木架，盖上木板，修造起三座临时涵洞。泥土不断地从陡坡上翻滚下来，微风一吹，战士们满面尘土，满嘴沙粒，热汗湿透了衣襟，结成泥巴。骤雨袭来，满沟泥水，大家在淤泥里工作，变成了泥人。一个个眼睛熬红了，嗓子喊哑了，衣服撕破了，鞋子弄丢了，仍然照样工作着。战士们就这样顽强的以一周间紧张劳动完成了架设涵洞的全部工作，给整个工作奠下了坚强的基石。填土工作开始了，伟大的劳动场面也立刻在人们面前展开，桥上桥下，千万个劳动者，象冲锋陷阵一般，你推我挤，前呼后拥的动作起来。挑土的人群象流水一样摆开了一条条的长蛇阵，上上下下，来来往往的奔忙着。重担子用力赶奔，轻担子拔腿飞跑，前面喊后面，后面催前面，喇叭筒的广播声，互相鼓励互相召唤的喊叫声，立刻和铣、镐、钁头与石头土块互相撞击的声音，会聚成一片巨大的劳动音响，这音响不管天晴不论风雨不分昼夜，整日在山谷里激动着，回荡着。入夜，马达开始响起来，三座桥头两岸的现场上，强大度数的电灯、汽灯和瓦斯灯，散发着闪闪的光亮。桥头上的夜，象大都会的夜市一样，人影幢幢，来往不断的穿行着。仲秋前后的季节，民工们都穿着薄薄的单衣服，北风不时的翻过山岭，掩袭到山谷里，停下来就会使人浑身打战。大家就提出“干的快，挑的多，省得身上打哆嗦。”一个紧跟一个，一排紧随一排的来往奔跑着。很多人在昏暗中跌了筋斗，随后就忙爬起来赶上去，直等到一个个跑得汗珠顺脸流下来，衣服也湿透了，眼望着黄土一层层的积高起来，才心满意足的在嘴角浮出胜利的微笑。
    三、好里求快，快里求好　夯实路基，保证行车
    为了使路基坚固持久，保证行车安全，每填土四○——五○公分，必须喷水打夯一次，使之凝固，于是工程委员会遂提出了“好里求快，快里求好，夯实路基，保证行车”的号召。得到民工们响亮的回答。各支队纷纷组织了打夯队，在铁道兵团战士喊号领导下，上千人的打夯队伍，一致的歌唱起来：“把夯举的高哟！打的深又好哟！大家齐努力哟！修好这大桥哟！……”夯声，歌声，象春雷一般响彻了豫西的山野。
    四、每个人都卷入革命竞赛
    工作进行中，轰轰烈烈地挑战竞赛争红旗争模范的运动展开了，每个人都卷入了这一革命英雄主义运动的高潮里，大家都在“修桥当劳动英雄，回家当翻身英雄”的口号下鼓舞起来。最初每人每日担土七十担就算最高成绩，但在竞赛中，劳动英雄李方顺很快上升到一百二十担，民工张海川由七十担提高到九十担、一百担。洛阳二中队二○七人，一天填土七九○立方米，新安五人做工小组，每人每天担土二·五立方米。当新中国成立的消息传到工地时，民工们以无比的欣快心情来欢迎它，他们一致提出“提早完成高填土，作为献给毛主席和新中国的贺礼。”大家都加倍紧张起来了，小劳动英雄薛喜在一二○米距离内，由七十担提到一百二十担，最后提到一百七十担；民工模范郭逢德，竟创造了每天担土一九四担的惊人纪录。民工干部们为了响应华中局和省委精简节约运动的号召，发起了“百担土运动”，号召每个干部及勤杂人员担土一百担，陕洲、新安等支队很快就响应了，为公家节省工资小麦二到三万斤。新安支队发动了“三担土运动”，每天收工以后多担三担土，很快就传播到其他桥头。又发动了“满筐运动”，装不满筐不走。为响应工程委员会“提高质量保证路基结实”的要求，渑池支队展开了“一石垫基运动”，上工过河时每人背一块大石头，填到路基上。新安支队发动了“积草护坡运动”，每天散步洗脸回来，将马灵草、爬地龙等各种杂草捡回来，存在阴湿的地方，整修偏坡时取出栽植，加强土质接力，使路基经久耐固。
    五、一座人民大学校
    由于地方党和民工干部的积极努力，整个高填土工程成了一座人民的大学校，现场变成了民工的政治课堂。由于在民工中进行了政治工作，民工们都严守着人民解放军的三大纪律和八项注意，找不到宿营地就露宿街头，烧饭喝水不扰群众。离开工地时，成立了检查组，进行毁物赔偿；到达工地后，马上就提出了“吃好（不吃生冷）、睡好（按时作息）、玩好（展开文娱活动）”三大要求。干部们抓住空隙就用集体上课、串窑洞分别讲、个别谈等办法，在民工中进行了剿匪、反霸、要翻身、闹革命等阶级教育，提高了民工的觉悟。并展开广泛的文娱活动，组织了业余宣传班，刊出了修桥快报，各个桥头都出版了席报（用两支木棍支起席子插在现场上），各中队都学会了大小十几个歌曲，现场上，窑洞里，上工收工的行军途中，整日洋溢着愉快的歌声。
    六、新中国建设的里程碑
    三十一万九千余立方公尺的高填土工程，就在这样日以继夜赶工抢修下，十月二十日全部竣工了。铁道兵团的战士和一万二千民工们，就这样用自己的双肩和双手，创造出来“平山填谷”的惊人奇迹。在竣工典礼当天，在交口车站上，树起了一座高大的纪念碑。这是千万个劳动人民的血汗结晶，也是新中国建设的里程碑。（附图片）
