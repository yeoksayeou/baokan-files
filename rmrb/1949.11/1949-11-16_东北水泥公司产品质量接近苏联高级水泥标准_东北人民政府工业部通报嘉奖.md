Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 15th. The Northeast State-owned Cement Company has made remarkable achievements in improving product quality. The Industry Department of the Northeast People's Government issued a commendation on the 8th of this month. The cement produced by the company, when tested using a 1:3 (one part cement, three parts standard sand) dry hardening method, showed, after 28 days of condensation, a tensile strength of 36.3 kg/cm² at the lowest and 37.6 kg/cm² at the highest, and a compressive strength of 533 kg at the lowest and 579 kg at the highest. This approaches the Soviet advanced cement standards of 32 kg/cm² for tensile strength and 600 kg for compressive strength, and exceeds the standards during the puppet Manchukuo period of 26 kg/cm² for tensile strength and 300 kg for compressive strength. The Northeast Industry Department pointed out in its commendation that the continuous improvement of the cement quality of the company is due to the leading cadres personally organizing workers, technicians, and administrative cadres to combine theory with practical experience, appropriately adjust the machines, improve operating methods, select appropriate raw materials, correctly proportion them, and systematically establish mutual testing and inspection systems between each hour, each day, each ten-day period, and each factory. In addition to encouraging the responsible cadres and all workers and staff of the cement company to continue to strive to meet the quality standards of Soviet advanced cement and to work hard to reduce costs, the department called on all factories and mines in the Northeast to learn from them.

　　东北水泥公司产品质量接近苏联高级水泥标准
    东北人民政府工业部通报嘉奖
    【新华社沈阳十五日电】东北国营水泥公司在改进产品质量上成绩卓著，东北人民政府工业部特于本月八日通报嘉奖。该公司所产水泥用一比三（水泥一，标准砂三）胶砂干式硬炼法试验结果，凝结二十八天后每平方公分的抗涨力，低者为三六·三公斤，高者为三七·六公斤，耐压力低者为五百三十三公斤，高者为五百七十九公斤；与苏联高级水泥的抗涨力为三十二公斤、耐压力为六百公斤相接近；超过了伪满时期抗涨力二十六公斤、耐压力三百公斤的标准。东北工业部在通报中指出：该公司水泥质量之所以能够不断提高，是由于领导干部亲自动手组织工人、技术人员及行政干部结合理论与实际经验，适当调整机器，改进操作方法，选用适当原料，加以正确的配合，并系统地建立了每小时、每天、每旬及各厂间互相化验与检查制度的结果。该部除勉励水泥公司的负责干部和全体工人、职员继续努力向苏联高级水泥的质量标准看齐和为降低成本而奋斗外，并号召东北所有工厂、矿山向他们学习。
