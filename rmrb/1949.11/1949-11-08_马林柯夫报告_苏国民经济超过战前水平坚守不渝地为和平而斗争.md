　　Malenkov's Report
  　Soviet National Economy Exceeds Pre-War Levels, Steadfastly Struggles for Peace
    Malenkov delivered a report on the 32nd anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution amidst warm applause. Tracing the path traversed by the Soviet Union under Soviet power, Malenkov emphasized: The creative forces of all nationalities, large and small, have found an outlet in the great Soviet federal family. Malenkov said: Never in its entire history has our country had such just and well-ordered borders as it does today. He then spoke of the Soviet Union's friendly neighbors: People's Democratic Poland, People's Democratic Czechoslovakia, the People's Republic of Hungary, the People's Republic of Romania, the People's Republic of Bulgaria, the Mongolian People's Republic, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the free People's Republic of China.

    Malenkov said that the Soviet people are commemorating the 32nd anniversary of the October Revolution with tremendous achievements in all sectors of the socialist national economy and culture. He pointed out that the pre-war level of the Soviet national economy had not only been reached but had also been surpassed, saying: We have every reason to believe that the first post-war Five-Year Plan will be completed ahead of schedule.

    Malenkov then stated: Our industry and agriculture have entered a new stage of vigorous expansion, opening up new possibilities for further improving the living standards and cultural levels of the Soviet people.

    Malenkov then depicted the remarkable progress in science, culture, and the arts, emphasizing: Soviet science is working for the cause of peace and for the prosperity of the Soviet motherland.

    In the second part of his report, Malenkov described the Soviet Union's struggle for peace, emphasizing: The Soviet Union, based on the foundations of the socialist system and the interests of the Soviet people, has steadfastly pursued a policy of peace and friendship among all nations.

    In the conclusion of his report, Malenkov declared: Today, we Soviet people look back with particular pride on the epoch-making feats accomplished by our party and our people under the leadership of Lenin and Stalin.

    The great October Socialist Revolution lives and triumphs in the great deeds of our glorious Bolshevik Party, in the glorious people's achievements of the Soviet land. The ideals of the great October Revolution live and triumph in the socialist construction now unfolding in all the people's democratic countries, in the historically significant upsurge of the Chinese people, and in the founding and consolidation of the German Democratic Republic. The great October Revolution lives and triumphs in the struggle being waged by the powerful front of peace, democracy, and socialism against the forces of imperialist aggression and the instigators of a new war.

    When he mentioned the name of the wise teacher and leader, Comrade Stalin, a storm of cheers resounded throughout the hall. All those present stood up, and shouts of congratulations to Comrade Stalin echoed in every corner of the hall.

    The conference, in great enthusiasm, adopted a congratulatory telegram to Comrade Stalin.

　　马林柯夫报告
  　苏国民经济超过战前水平坚守不渝地为和平而斗争
    马林柯夫在热烈的欢迎当中作了十月社会主义革命三十二周年的报告。马林柯夫在追溯苏联在苏维埃政权下所经历的道路时，强调地说：大小民族的创造性力量已在苏联民族大联邦中找到了出路。马林柯夫说：我国在她的全部历史中从来没有象今天这样有着如此公正和秩序井然的国界。至此，他便讲到苏联的友邻：人民民主的波兰、人民民主的捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利人民共和国、罗马尼亚人民共和国、保加利亚人民共和国、蒙古人民共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和自由的中华人民共和国。
    马林柯夫说，苏联人民正以在社会主义国民经济与文化的一切部门中的巨大成就，来纪念十月革命三十二周年。他在指出苏联国民经济的战前水平不仅已经达到而且还超过了的时候说：我们完全有理由相信，第一个战后五年计划将会提前完成。
    马林柯夫继而说道：我们的工业与农业已经进入了强有力扩展的新阶段，给进一步提高苏联人民生活水平与文化水平，开辟了新的可能性。
    马林柯夫于是描绘出科学、文化与艺术各方面值得注意的进展，并着重指出：苏维埃科学为和平事业和为苏维埃祖国的繁荣而工作。
    马林柯夫在其报告的第二部分中描述苏联为和平所进行的斗争，并强调说：苏联从社会主义制度的根基、从苏维埃人民的利益出发，坚守不渝地执行了和平与各民族间友好的政策。
    马林柯夫在报告结语中宣称：今天，我们苏联人民以特别自豪的心情回顾着我们的党及我国人民在列宁与斯大林领导下所完成的划时代的伟绩。
    伟大的十月社会主义革命在我们光荣的布尔什维克党的伟绩中，在苏维埃国度光荣的人民伟绩中生存和胜利。伟大的十月革命的理想，在所有各人民民主国家的现已展开的社会主义建设中、在中国人民有历史意义的高涨中、和在德意志民主共和国的奠立与巩固中生存和胜利。伟大的十月革命在和平、民主、社会主义拥护者的强大阵线对帝国主义侵略力量、对新战争挑拨者所正在进行的斗争中生存和胜利。
    当他提到英明的导师与领袖斯大林同志的名字的时候，暴风雨般的欢呼声响彻了大厅。与会者全体起立，祝贺斯大林同志的欢呼声在大厅的每一角落里震响着。
    大会在巨大的热情中，通过了给斯大林同志的贺电。
