Xinhua News Agency, South China Front, 27th: The People's Liberation Army's Fourth Field Army liberated Wuzhou, an important town in eastern Guangxi, at 6:00 PM on the 25th. The defending enemy abandoned the city and fled. When the PLA entered the city, the citizens lined the streets to welcome them with thunderous applause and endless firecrackers. All public buildings in the city were not damaged by the bandit troops, thanks to the PLA's rapid advance and the heroic protection of the staff. Wuzhou merchants organized volunteer police teams to maintain order. The power plant, water plant, customs, telegraph, telephone bureau, and hospital were all in good condition, and the employees of these units were ready for the PLA to take over. The PLA troops who entered the city slept on the streets that night, and only entered the houses to stay the next morning. The material warehouses guarded by the troops remained intact. Because the currency value was not yet determined, the troops stipulated that they would not buy goods from merchants for three days to avoid losses to the merchants, which won a very good impression from the citizens.

Xinhua News Agency, South China Front, 27th: Introduction to Wuzhou: Wuzhou, also known as Cangwu, is located in eastern Guangxi and is one of the four major cities in Guangxi (the other three are Guilin, Liuzhou, and Nanning). The city has a population of about 150,000. It is located at the intersection of the Xun and Gui Rivers and is a transportation hub between Guangdong and Guangxi provinces. Goods from Yunnan, Guizhou, and southern Hunan are mostly concentrated here and transshipped to Hong Kong and Guangzhou for export. Exports mainly include livestock, firewood, charcoal, grains, rice, leather, sugar, and oils; imports mainly include rice, tea, cloth, salt, metals, tung oil, and kerosene. The industry has dozens of factories producing dyeing and weaving, tea making, machinery, sulfuric acid, oil extraction, cigarettes, and batteries. Smuggling was rampant in the past. In order to collude with American imperialism, the Gui Clique bandits requested and obtained approval from the puppet Executive Yuan to open Wuzhou as a commercial port, selling out national sovereignty, which was met with fierce opposition from the people.

Xinhua News Agency, South China Front, 27th: The People's Liberation Army that went south from Guilin liberated Yangshuo County on the 25th. Our army in northern Guangxi captured Jinchengjiang, an important station on the Qian-Gui Railway, on the same day. Yangshuo is located south of Guilin, on the north bank of the Gui River. It has many solitary peaks, caves, and cliffs, forming a "peak forest" that reflects the clear waters of the Gui River, with a beautiful scenery. It is said that "Guilin's scenery is the best in the world, and Yangshuo's scenery is the best in Guilin." In the battle to capture Liuzhou on the 25th, the People's Liberation Army captured more than 1,400 bandits. Liuzhou was an important supply base for the Gui Clique bandits. When the bandits fled in panic, they abandoned a large number of weapons, ammunition, and vehicles. The captured items are currently being inventoried.

Xinhua News Agency, Southwest Front, 27th: The People's Liberation Army liberated Shizhu County in eastern Sichuan on the 19th and pursued and annihilated most of the enemy's Hubei Provincial Security First and Second Divisions in the Wanshengba and Shuanghekou areas northeast of the city, capturing 699 enemy soldiers below the deputy regimental commander level. The remaining enemies were routed. On the 21st, the PLA annihilated a part of the enemy's Independent 263rd Division in Mugenpu, southeast of Fuling, capturing 837 enemy soldiers below the regimental commander Zhou Jiafeng.

From the 19th to the 21st, another PLA unit annihilated parts of the enemy's 9th Division of the 2nd Army, the 76th Division, and the 243rd Division of the 15th Army in Wanzu south of Pengshui and Zhouzitu, Huoshi'e, Wenwutang, Luoboba, Yuanjiacao west of Wulong, and other places, capturing more than 2,300 enemy soldiers. The remaining enemies fled west in droves.

During this period, a PLA unit intercepted eight enemy grain transport boats at Tukanchang, northwest of Wulong, and seized more than 300,000 catties of grain.

Xinhua News Agency, Southwest Front, 27th: The People's Liberation Army unit advancing into western Guizhou captured Qianxi and Dading, two counties northwest of Guiyang, on the 24th and 25th respectively. In the battle, they annihilated parts of the enemy's 275th Division of the 49th Army and the Independent Division of the 89th Army, capturing 440 enemy soldiers below Rao Qiyao, Chief of Staff of the 49th Army, and seizing 2 mortars and 2 grenade launchers, 4 light machine guns, more than 180 rifles, and 1 vehicle. Prior to this, a PLA unit advancing south from Guiyang occupied Dushan, an important town on the Qian-Gui Railway, on the 20th, capturing more than 100 enemy soldiers of the 100th Army. The remaining enemies fled south.

　　桂东解放梧州
    阳朔及金城江同日为我攻克
    川黔续克石砫黔西大定独山
    【新华社华南前线二十七日电】人民解放军第四野战军某部，于二十五日晚六时解放广西东部重镇梧州市。守敌弃城逃窜。当解放军入城时市民夹道欢迎，掌声雷动，鞭炮不绝。城内一切公共建筑在解放军迅速挺进及员工英勇保护下，未遭匪军破坏。梧州商民组织义勇警察队维持秩序，发电厂、自来水厂、海关、电报、电话局及医院等设备均完好，各该单位员工均准备解放军接收。解放军入城部队当晚均露宿街头，天明始进房住宿，部队看管的物资仓库等均原封不动。因币值未定，部队规定三日内不向商家购买物品，以免商民吃亏，博得市民极好的印象。
    【新华社华南前线二十七日电】梧州介绍：梧州又称苍梧，位于广西东部，系广西四大都市之一（其他三处为桂林、柳州、南宁），全市人口约十五万。地处浔桂两江交汇处，为粤桂两省的交通要道，云南、贵州及湘南的货物多集中于此，转输香港广州出口。输出以牲畜、柴炭、谷米、皮革、砂糖、油类为大宗；输入以米、茶、纱布、食盐、金属、桐油及煤油为大宗。工业有染织、制茶、机械、硫酸、榨油、卷烟、电池等工厂数十家。该地过去走私风气甚盛，桂系匪首为勾结美帝国主义曾请准伪行政院开放梧州作为商埠，出卖国家主权，遭到人民的激烈反对。
    【新华社华南前线二十七日电】由桂林南下的人民解放军二十五日解放阳朔县城，桂北我军则于同日攻占黔桂路上的重要车站金城江。阳朔在桂林以南，临桂江北岸，多孤峰、岩穴、石壁峭立，形成一带“峰林”，与桂江碧流相映，风景幽丽，有“桂林山水甲天下、阳朔山水甲桂林”之称。解放军二十五日攻占柳州的战斗中，俘匪一千四百余名。柳州为桂系匪军的重要补给基地，匪军仓皇逃窜时，遗弃武器、弹药、车辆极多，缴获正清查中。
    【新华社西南前线二十七日电】人民解放军某部，于十九日解放川东的石砫县城，并在该城东北的万胜坝、双河口地区，追歼敌湖北省保安第一、二两师大部，俘敌副团长以下六百九十九人，残敌溃散。解放军于二十一日又在涪陵东南之木根铺，歼敌独立二六三师一部，俘敌团长周家峰以下八百三十七名。
    自十九日至二十一日，另部解放军在彭水南的万足及以西的周子沱、火石垩、文武堂、萝卜坝、武隆以西袁家漕等处，歼敌二军之九师、七十六师、十五军之二四三师等各一部，共俘敌二千三百余人，残敌纷纷向西逃窜。
    在此期间，解放军某部在武隆西北之土坎场，截击敌运粮船八只，缴获粮食三十余万斤。
    【新华社西南前线二十七日电】挺进贵州西部的人民解放军某部，于二十四、二十五两日先后攻占贵阳西北的黔西和大定两座县城。在战斗中歼敌四十九军的二七五师，八十九军的独立师各一部，俘敌四十九军参谋长饶启尧以下四百四十余人，缴迫击炮、掷弹筒各二，轻机枪四挺，步枪一百八十余支，汽车一辆，在此之前，由贵阳南进的人民解放军某部，于二十日占领黔桂路上的重镇独山，俘敌一百军百余人，余敌南逃。
