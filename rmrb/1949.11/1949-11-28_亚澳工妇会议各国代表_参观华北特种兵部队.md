Louis Saillant, Secretary-General of the World Federation of Trade Unions, and Solovyov, head of the Soviet delegation, delivered speeches successively. Saillant said: If it were not for the victory of the heroic Chinese People's Liberation Army, the Asian-Australian Labor Conference would not have been possible to convene in Beijing. Therefore, in the name of the Executive Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions and in the name of the Asian-Australian Labor Conference, he paid tribute to the Chinese People's Liberation Army, to the soldiers fighting the enemy in the South, and especially paid the highest tribute to the martyrs who had heroically sacrificed themselves.
