Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 19th – As the People's Liberation Army advances triumphantly into the southwestern provinces, the head of the Kuomintang remnant bandit gang, Chiang Kai-shek, hastily fled from Taipei to Chongqing on the 14th, attempting to rally his cohorts for a desperate last stand. According to a Central News Agency (a KMT mouthpiece) report on the 17th, Chiang Kai-shek will reappear in disguise, leading the remnant bandits in their anti-people war under the guise of "President." Before Chiang Kai-shek's arrival in Chongqing, Gui clique ringleader Li Zongren left Chongqing for Kunming on the 3rd of this month. After staying there for a week, he flew back to his lair in Guilin, and on the 14th, he ran from Guilin to Nanning. On the day of Chiang's arrival in Chongqing, he telegraphed Li, asking him to return to Chongqing to "discuss everything," but Li Zongren ignored him and continued to fly to Hainan Island on the 16th for activities. By the 17th, he claimed to have a "recurrence of stomach problems" and refused to return to Chongqing. This is another ugly scene of the Gui clique bandits and Chiang bandits vying for power amidst the People's Liberation Army's sweeping advance. Although both factions of traitorous and reactionary remnants share the same goal of continuing to be enemies of the people and engaging in a last-ditch struggle, the Gui clique warlords plan to collude with the remnant bandit armies of Yunnan and Guangdong, independently seizing aid from American, British, and French imperialists to engage in stubborn resistance. Bai Chongxi's radio speech in Guilin on the 9th of this month attempted to curry favor with his American masters. Bai Bandit said, "Regarding the distribution and application of aid materials, we are hoping to obtain technical assistance and correct guidance from friendly nations (referring to the United States)." This fully demonstrates that the discord between Chiang and the Li-Bai bandit gangs is merely a dogfight for scraps between two groups of American imperialist lackeys.

　　蒋贼仓皇由台飞渝企图纠合残匪挣扎
  　与桂系匪帮争咬骨头
    【新华社北京十九日电】在人民解放军向西南诸省大举进军之际，国民党残余匪帮头子蒋介石于十四日由台北仓皇飞抵重庆，企图纠合其狐群狗党进行垂死挣扎。据匪中央社十七日透露，蒋介石将重新粉墨登场，以所谓“总统”资格领导残匪进行反人战争。桂系匪首李宗仁在蒋介石到重庆前，于本月三日离渝飞昆明，逗留一周后飞回老巢桂林，十四日复由桂林跑到南宁。蒋贼到重庆的一天打电报给李贼，要他回重庆“商谈一切”但李宗仁不理睬，于十六日继续飞到海南岛活动。到十七日又说“胃病复发”，拒绝回重庆。这是桂系匪帮与蒋匪之间在人民解放军大扫荡之下互相争夺权力的又一幕丑剧。虽然两派卖国反动残余势力都抱着继续与人民为敌进行垂死挣扎的同一目的，但桂系军阀则打算与云南及广东的残余匪军勾结，单独攫取美、英、法帝国主义的援助，从事负隅顽抗。本月九日白匪崇禧在桂林发表的广播演说，曾力图向美国主子献媚。白匪说：“关于援助物资的分配与应用，吾人正希望获得友邦（指美国）在技术上的协助与正确的指导。”足见蒋与李、白匪帮之间的龉龃就是美国帝国主义两群走狗之间争咬骨头。
