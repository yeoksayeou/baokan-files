　　Introduction to the Health Work of the First Field Army
　　　　　I. Many Patients in the Early Stages of the War
　　Since the spring of 1947, when the Hu bandits invaded northward with all their forces, our army took the initiative to withdraw from Yan'an. Large corps gathered in the narrow mountainous areas and fought continuously. There were few houses, dirty clothes, and a lack of food and vegetables. The troops lived very hard and were very tired, resulting in many diseases. At that time, the energy of all health personnel was mostly focused on the treatment of large numbers of battle wounds, and little attention was paid to prevention. As a result, the number of sick soldiers increased.
　　The huge reduction in personnel due to illness not only increased the state's economic expenditure but also affected the combat effectiveness of the troops. During marches, almost every company had sick soldiers sitting on stretchers, riding donkeys, and walking on foot. The soldiers had high morale but were physically weak. This situation caused difficulties for military and political cadres, and the patients were, of course, distressed. Health personnel were also troubled by being busy with seeing patients and prescribing medicine all day, but the number of patients did not decrease.
　　　　　II. Penetrating into Companies to Make a Breakthrough
　　In order to study the causes of diseases and strengthen health and epidemic prevention work, the Field Army Health Department sent Comrade Ma Xinghui to go deep into the companies and live with the soldiers (eating, sleeping, exercising, and attending meetings). From daily life, it was discovered that many diseases were mainly caused by poor food (poor cooking and eating methods) and improper living management. However, soldiers and cadres were somewhat panicked by the large number of illnesses at the time and hoped that the medicine would cure the disease. To solve this problem, explanations and health propaganda and education were carried out on the one hand, and suggestions were made to strengthen life management and improve food on the other. Military and political cadres did not respond, and health personnel lacked confidence, believing that conditions were difficult and improving food was not suitable for front-line requirements. Since the opinions could not be implemented, they had to slowly approach the quartermasters and talk about the excessive amount of grain and the many patients' meals. They personally went to the kitchens of each company every day to help with cooking, and took time to talk to the cooks about cooking methods. They learned a lot from the masses and gradually corrected some of their old ways of cooking. The soldiers responded well to the food, which increased the cooks' confidence. The improvement of food thus brewed from below.
　　Taking this opportunity, a weaker company was selected for further experimentation. The cooking methods were changed according to the supply standards, and the original ingredients were made into many varieties to make them nutritious, delicious, and easy to digest. The food intake of each person was registered every day, their lives were observed, and their stools were checked. After this experiment, the soldiers ate well, their food intake gradually normalized, there were no more beans and rice grains in the stools, fewer people had diarrhea and gas, the grain was not exceeded, weight increased, and the number of sick soldiers decreased. The soldiers were very happy, and the improved methods were very easy. In this way, the quartermasters and cooks had even more confidence, and their work became more active and diligent. Everyone set up merit plans, visited and competed with each other. This method was quickly promoted, and the food of the entire regiment was improved. Moreover, the improvement of food promoted various health works.
　　　　　III. Gaining Experience and Promoting Universally
　　In early 1948, after summarizing the experience of improving food, the Field Health Department introduced this experience in health publications and the Masses Daily. It called on health personnel throughout the army to learn from Comrade Ma Xinghui, which aroused the attention of the entire army. Everyone was brewing to try it, and they all believed that this method was scientific, easy, and could solve the current problems of the troops. It was easily accepted by the masses and welcomed by everyone. In July, the Field Health Department held a health ministers' conference. Everyone reviewed their shortcomings and exchanged experiences, from which they improved their new understanding of preventive medicine. It was resolved to take the improvement of food as the center of the health work of the troops and to use all forces to carry out this movement. In August, at the supply ministers' conference of the entire army, the food issue was discussed specifically. It was resolved that the supply work should be oriented to the soldiers and serve the soldiers. Many reference materials for improving food were printed and distributed at the meeting. The leaders of the First Field Army called on party committees at all levels and military and political cadres at all levels to ensure that food was well managed at an enlarged meeting of the Front Committee. Then, the responsible comrades of the various departments of the Field Service organized a research committee on company life in order to improve the work of the company.
　　From then on, the armies and divisions held training classes for quartermasters, and the regiments and battalions rotated training for cooks. Many leaders of divisions and regiments personally led the improvement of food and organized mutual visits. The quartermasters and cooks brought dishes and meals to compare and evaluate each other. Supply cadres held meetings to study adjustments and organize unified procurement (to ensure the supply of materials). Economic democracy was implemented, everyone participated in the management of food, and various systems were established. Menus were ordered every week, and everyone learned scientific cooking techniques. Even during marches and battles, the quartermasters and cooks, regardless of fatigue, carried vegetables and meat (such as dried vegetables and salted meat) over long distances and were still able to ensure that the food was well managed according to the menu. Many units were able to drink hot boiled water and eat hot meals every day in the trenches. Improving food has become an unprecedentedly widespread mass upsurge in the First Field Army over the past year. In this movement, a large number of model quartermasters and meritorious cooks emerged. In particular, the 7th Company of the 20th Regiment of the 7th Division became a model health company for the entire army of the First Field Army, and was personally commended by the leaders of the First Field Army, Peng, Zhang, and Zhao, and called on the entire army to learn from the 7th Company.
　　This movement has indeed improved the health of the troops. For example, newly liberated soldiers were all sallow and thin when they first arrived, but in less than two months, they became red and fat again. For example, during the winter training in 1948, four companies of the 1st Army and thirty-eight food units of the 4th Army weighed themselves twice. The results showed that in just two months, the average weight of the soldiers increased by 1.7 to 2.6 catties (old scale). Everyone was radiant and full of energy, and they all felt that the food and health work had been done well, and the number of sick soldiers had decreased. For example:

　　　　Comparison Table of Diseases by Season in the 1st Army in 1948
Disease Name　　Total　　First Half of Year　　Second Half of Year
Digestive System Diseases　295　　208　　87
Typhus　75　　6　　9
Influenza　869　　522　　347

　　　　Comparison Table of Outpatient Diseases by Season in the 1st Army in 1948
Disease Name　　Total　　First Half of Year　　Second Half of Year
Acute Enteritis　727　　596　　131
Acute Gastritis　267　　33　　136
Diarrhea　380　　350　　30

　　From the above two tables, it can also be proved that after the food was improved, various gastrointestinal diseases were greatly reduced.
　　　　　IV. Mobilizing the Masses and Seizing Publicity
　　After the Health Ministers' Conference in July, the armies and divisions held health cadre meetings, conveyed the resolutions of the conference in detail, and carried out repeated education in accordance with the spirit of "prevention first," which improved the cadres' new understanding of health and epidemic prevention work. Many health personnel put down their airs, went deep into the companies to help improve food, and gave health lessons to the soldiers with various specific examples. They put raw water, scabies mites, lice, etc. under a microscope to instill scientific knowledge to the soldiers and carried out health propaganda in coordination with military and political tasks. Due to the widespread development of the food movement, the entire health work was promoted, the prestige of health personnel was improved, confidence in work was increased, and enthusiasm and creativity were improved. Military and political cadres felt that the work of the health department was an important part of military and political work, and therefore paid more attention to it. It was stipulated as an item in the reports of military and political reports at all levels, and health subjects were also included in the formal exercise time, actively helping the health department to solve difficulties and carry out work.
　　In actual work, health personnel deeply realized that in order to carry out health work, it is not only necessary to rely on organizational forces, but also to mobilize the masses. Through the understanding of the masses, the masses should be improved and organized in order to have the strength to do the work well. Therefore, after the Health Ministers' Conference in July, through everyone's efforts, mass health organizations were generally established throughout the army by the end of 1948. Each company had a health committee, and each squad democratically elected an activist to serve as a health soldier (without leaving their original job). They were organized into health groups by platoon and often taught health knowledge. These awakened, enthusiastic, and active health soldiers understood that doing a good job in health work would reduce illness and kill more enemies. They bravely rescued the wounded on the battlefield and patiently and tirelessly urged the health work in peacetime, becoming the core of the company's health work and a powerful assistant to the health workers. Through them, the broad masses were mobilized. At the same time, the People's Liberation Army soldiers were the most reasonable. As long as you do not ridicule them, but can sincerely explain the principles of hygiene, they are resolute implementers. For example, digging toilets in camps and burying latrines before departure have become normal systems in the army under everyone's efforts, and the phenomenon of drinking cold water has also been greatly reduced.
　　　　　V. Everyone Eliminates Lice and the Entire Army Eliminates Scabies
　　The arduousness of the war and the large increase in new components of the troops (newly liberated soldiers) caused the troops to have many lice and scabies. From the beginning of January to the end of November 1948, a total of 9,332 cases of scabies, 2,639 cases of relapsing fever, and 478 cases of typhus occurred in the army, which had a great impact on the health and combat effectiveness of the troops.
　　In the past, although the work of eliminating lice and scabies was constantly carried out throughout the year, there was no plan, lack of organization, and full preparation, so effort and money were spent, but the soldiers' suffering was not relieved. To this end, at the beginning of the winter training in 1948, the Field Health Department issued a winter training health work plan, requiring everyone to eliminate lice and the entire army to eliminate scabies, and requested the approval of higher authorities to issue fifteen catties of carbolic acid, two taels of sulfur, four taels of lard, and five qian of alkali to each scabies case; each healthy person was issued three catties of carbolic acid for killing lice; as a material guarantee for this movement. Many military and division health ministers and military and political leaders personally took action. Among them, the 2nd Army did the best, and they created new methods for large-scale lice and scabies eradication. Due to the widespread and thorough nature of this movement, 99% (3,566) of the army's 3,593 scabies cases were cured, and only 27 cases were transferred to the hospital. Because of the large-scale lice elimination movement, only one case of typhus and thirty-six cases of relapsing fever occurred in the army in the first half of 1949, which is very obvious compared with 1948.
　　　　　VI. Health is Improved and Diseases are Reduced
　　The Northwest is vast and sparsely populated, with a backward economy and culture, many diseases, and difficult medical care. In the arduous battles, we resolutely implemented the policy of prevention first and changed the passive and simple treatment style. We began to turn to active prevention work and adopted many indigenous methods under difficult conditions to solve and overcome many difficulties, so that the health work of the army was improved from its original level, and the incidence of disease was significantly reduced. The comparison of the number of existing patients in the army in the two periods from the beginning of January to the end of November 1948 is as follows: 7,405 at the beginning of January and 4,320 at the end of November (a reduction of 3,085). During the same period, the number of hospitalized patients decreased by 36%. The number of troops in the current year has increased several times, and the incidence of disease and the number of hospitalized patients have decreased compared with 1948, according to general understanding. According to general rules, the incidence of disease in autumn is always higher than in any other season. From mid-July to the end of August, it was the period when the troops marched from Xi'an to Lanzhou. During the forty days (including the battle dates), they traveled more than 1,600 li, and very few troops fell behind due to illness. Especially when our army entered the Hui area, the army discipline was even better, especially the health discipline, which was praised by the local people. From the above examples, it can be seen that the promotion of health and epidemic prevention work is a very important issue. The improvement of food is related to the vital interests of every commander and fighter in life. The promotion of food improvement is loved by every commander and fighter. The problem is easiest for them to accept, and when the food is improved, all health work can be smoothly promoted. The health work of the troops can be steadily promoted and developed. Because it has a broad mass base, this is an undoubted fact. From these initial gains, it proves that the business policy put forward by the Health Department of the Central Military Commission for the future: the policy of prevention first and treatment as a supplement is completely correct. The whole country will soon be completely liberated in the shortest time, and the whole country will soon enter the construction stage, and health work will also have stable and favorable conditions and material basis. We have sufficient reasons and confidence that health and epidemic prevention work will be developed in all aspects.

　　第一野战军卫生工作介绍
  　　　　　一　战争初期病人很多
    从四七年春，胡匪倾巢北犯，我军主动撤出延安后，大兵团聚集在狭小的山区内，连续作战。房子少，衣服脏，缺粮无菜，部队生活很苦，身体很累，疾病很多，而当时全体卫生人员的精力，又多集中在大批的战伤的救治上，很少注意预防工作，这样，病号就越来越多了。
    巨大的疾病减员，不仅增加了国家的经济开支，而且影响了部队的战斗力。行军时，坐担架，骑毛驴，和徒步走的病号，几乎每个连队都有。战士的斗志很高，但身体弱，这种情况使军政干部，感到困难，病人们当然也苦恼，卫生人员也苦于整天忙着看病开药，而病人并没有减少。
    　　　　二　深入连队突破一点
    为了研究疾病原因，和加强卫生防疫工作，野战军卫生部派马兴惠同志深入连队，和战士生活在一起（吃饭、睡觉、上操、开会），从日常生活中，发现许多疾病，主要是由于伙食不好（做法、吃法不好），和生活管理不当得来的。但战士干部，对当时的大批患病，都有些惊慌，无不希望能药到病除。为了解决这个问题，乃一面进行解释，和卫生宣传教育，一面则建议加强生活管理和改善伙食。军政干部没有反映，卫生人员没有信心，以为条件困难，要改善伙食，是不适合前方要求的。意见行不通，只好慢慢去和事务长们接近，闲谈粮食超过及病号饭很多等情况，每天亲到各连伙房动手帮助，烧火做饭，抽空和炊事员们交谈菜饭做法，通过组织找炊事员们开漫谈会，从群众中了解和学习了很多东西，也逐渐纠正了他们做菜做饭的若干老一套的办法。战士们对伙食的反映很好，提高了炊事员们的信心，改善伙食　就这样从下面酝酿起来了。
    趁此，选择了一个较弱的连队，做进一步的实验，依供给标准改变菜饭的做法，把原有东西做成许多花样，使其养人，好吃，好消化，每天登记每人的食量，观察他们的生活，检查他们的大便，经过这样实验后，战士们吃的好了，饭量逐渐正常了，大便里的豆瓣，米粒没有了，拉稀放屁的人少了，粮食不超过了，体重增加了，病号减少了，战士们都很高兴，而改善的办法又很容易，这样，事务长，炊事员们的信心就更加提高，工作越发积极努力了，大家都订立功计划，互相参观竞赛，这个办法很快推广了出去，全团的伙食也都搞起来了，而且在改善伙食中，更推动了各项卫生工作。
    　　　　三　取得经验普遍推广
    一九四八年初，把改善伙食的经验总结了后，野卫把这个经验，先后介绍在卫生刊物和群众日报上。号召全军卫生人员向马兴惠同志学习，于是引起了全军的注意，大家都在酝酿试办，都认为这个办法科学容易，又能解决部队的当前问题，既能为群众所接受，又很受大家欢迎。七月间，野卫召开卫生部长会议，大家检讨了缺点，交换了经验，从中提高了预防医学的新认识。决议把改善伙食作为部队卫生工作的中心，要用一切力量去开展这个运动。八月份，全军的供给部长会议上，又专题讨论了伙食问题，决议供给工作，要面向士兵，为兵服务。会上并印发了许多改善伙食的参考材料。一野首长在前委扩大会上，号召各级党委和各级军政干部，都要保证办好伙食，接着野勤各部的负责同志，为了搞好连队工作，又组织了连队生活研究委员会。
    从此以后，各军各师都举办了事务长训练班，各团营都在轮训炊事员，许多师、团的首长，亲自领导改善伙食，并组织互相参观。事务长炊事员们则拿上菜饭，互比互评。供给干部，开会研究调剂，组织统一采购。（保证了物质供给）实行经济民主，大家参加管理伙食，建立各种制度，每周都订菜饭谱。大家学习科学煮调技术。就是在行军作战中，事务长，炊事员们，都不顾疲劳，远路担上菜肉，（如干菜，咸肉等）仍能保证按菜饭谱把伙食办好。好多单位，做到在战壕里每天喝热开水，顿顿吃热菜饭。改善伙食，已成为一年来，一野空前广泛的群众热潮了，在这个运动中，涌出了大批模范事务长和立功炊事员。尤以七师二十团七连，成了一野全军的卫生模范连，荣获一野彭、张、赵诸首长的亲自嘉奖，并号召全军向七连看齐。
    这个运动使部队的健康确实提高了。如新解放战士初来时，都是面黄肌瘦，不到两个月，就又红又胖，再如一九四八年冬训中，一军四个连队，四军三八个伙食单位，两次称体重的结果，只隔了两个月，战士们的平均体重，就增加了一点七，至二点六斤（老秤）。大家都红光满面，精神饱满，一致感到伙食和卫生工作搞好了，部队的病号减少了。如：
    　　　　一军一九四八年各季往诊疾病比较表
　病名　　合计　　上半年　　下半年消化系病　２９５　２０８　　８７斑疹伤寒　７５　　６　　　　 ９６流行性感冒　８６９　５２２　３４７
　　　　　　一军一九四八年各季门诊疾病比较表病名　　合计　　上半年　　下半年急性肠炎　７２７　５９６　１３１急性胃炎　２６７　３３　　１３６腹泻　　　３８０　３５０　３０
    从以上两表中也可以证明，伙食改善了后，各种肠胃性疾病，大为减少了。
    　　　　四　发动群众抓紧宣传
    七月卫生部长会议后，各军、师都召开了卫生干部会议，详细传达了大会的决议，依“预防第一”的精神进行了反复的教育，提高了干部对卫生防疫工作的新认识。许多卫生人员都放下架子，深入连队全力帮助改善伙食，用各种具体事例，给战士上卫生课，把生水、疥虫、虱子等放在显微镜下，洒输战士科学常识，配合军政任务，展开卫生宣传。由于伙食运动的普遍开展，推动了整个卫生工作，提高了卫生人员的威信，增加了工作信心，提高了积极性创造性，使军、政干部感到卫生部门的工作，乃是军政工作之一重要部份，因而更加重视。规定为各级军政报告中的一项，而卫生课目亦列入正式操课时间，主动帮助卫生部门解决困难，开展工作。
    在实际工作中，使卫生人员深深体会到，开展卫生工作，不仅要依靠组织力量，而且一定要发动群众，通过群众的认识，提高群众，把群众组织起来，才有力量，才能把工作搞好，所以从七月卫生部长会议后，经大家的努力，至一九四八年年底全军已普遍建立了群众卫生组织，连队都有卫生委员会，每班民主选出一个积极分子，任卫生战士（不脱离原工作），以排编成卫生小组，经常教以卫生常识。这些觉悟了的热情积极的卫生战士，懂得搞好卫生工作，就会少生疾病，就能多杀敌人。他们在战场上英勇的抢救伤员，平时耐心不倦的督促进行卫生工作，成了连队卫生工作的核心。成了卫生员的有力助手。通过他们，把广大群众动员起来，同时人民解放战士是最讲道理的，只要你不是嘲笑他，而能真诚的把讲卫生的道理讲明白后，他们就是坚决的执行者，如宿营挖厕所，出发埋粪坑，在大家努力下，已成为全军的正常制度了，喝冷水的现象，同样也大为减少了。
    　　　　五　人人灭虱全军灭疥
    战争的艰苦，和部队新成份的大量增加（新解放战士），使部队虱子疥疮很多，从一九四八年一月初，到十一月末，全军共发生了疮疥９３３２例，回归热２６３９例，斑疹伤寒４７８例，这给部队的健康和战斗力的影响是很大的。
    过去的灭虱灭疥工作，虽然常年不断的都在进行，但没有计划，缺乏组织和充分准备，所以出了力，化了钱，并没有解除战士的痛苦。为此，在四八年冬训之初，野卫印发了冬训卫生工作计划，要求人人灭虱全军灭疥，并呈请上级批准每个疥号发给石炭十五斤，硫黄二两，猪油四两，石碱五钱，每个健康人发给灭虱石炭三斤；作为这个运动的物质保证。许多军师卫生部长，和军政首长，都亲自下手，其中二军搞的最好，他们更创造了大规模灭虱灭疥的新办法，由于这一运动的普遍彻底，将全军３５９３名疥号治疗百分之九十九（３５６６名）只有二十七名未愈转院了。因大规模的灭虱运动，使一九四九年上半年，全军仅共发生了斑疹伤寒一例，回归热三十六例，这和一九四八年相比，其收效是很明显的。
    　　　　六　卫生搞好疾病减少
    西北地广人稀，经济文化落后，疾病很多，医药困难，在坚苦的战斗中，我们坚决执行了预防为主的方针，改变消极单纯的治疗作风。开始转向积极的预防工作，在困难的条件下，采取了许多土办法，解决和战胜了许多困难，使得全军卫生工作，从原有的水平上，提高了一步，发病率显著的减少。一九四八年一月初至十一月末，两个时期全军现有病人数目的对比是这样，一月初７４０５名，十一月末为４３２０名却减少３０８５名），同一时期内住院的病人减少３６％，本年度部队人数更增加了几倍，而发病率和住院病人，根据平常的了解，较一九四八年减少了。根据一般规律，秋季发病率，总是高于任何一个季节，从七月中旬到八月末，正是部队由西安出发向兰州猛烈进军作战时期，四十天中（作战日期在内），行进一千六百余华里，部队很少有人因病掉队，尤其我军进入回民地带，军队纪律更为良好，特别是卫生纪律，深受当地群众所赞扬。从以上这些例子来看卫生防疫工作的推行，是十分重要的问题，伙食的改善，有关着每个指战员生活上的切身利益，推行改善伙食，为每个指战员所喜爱，提出问题最易为他们接受，伙食改善了，一切卫生工作才能顺利的推行。部队的卫生工作才能稳固的向前推进和发展。因为它有广大的群众基础，这是没有什么可疑惑的事实，从这些初步的收获中，证明中央军委卫生部提出今后卫生部门的业务方针：预防为主，治疗为辅的方针是完全正确的。全国在最短期内，很快就要全部解放，全国即要开始进入建设阶段，而卫生工作亦有了安定的有利条件和物质基础。我们有充足的理由和信心，卫生防预工作在各个方面都开会展起来的。
