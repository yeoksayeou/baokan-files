　　Qianxing and Three Other Native Banks in Beijing
  　Fined for Illegal Lending
    [Beijing News] Qianxing, Tongyuanxiang, Dadeheng, and Xiangruixing, four privately-owned native banks in Beijing, have violated government decrees by making a large number of loans. The Financial Committee of the Municipal People's Government has recently imposed fines on them based on the severity of their offenses as a warning to others. A strict examination of the four native banks' business operations from October 11th to 16th by the Financial Management Section of the People's Bank of China, Beijing Branch, revealed that they continuously borrowed a large amount of funds from their peers for lending, reaching a total of 390,620,000 yuan. Moreover, the total amount of loans issued by these four native banks exceeded their total deposits, and their cash reserve ratios were consistently insufficient. For example, Qianxing Native Bank's shortfall reached a maximum of 95 percent. From October 12th to October 16th, its required cash reserve was 57,130,000 yuan, but it was actually short by 40,680,000 yuan. Tongyuanxiang Native Bank's required cash reserve from October 11th to October 16th was 41,100,000 yuan, but it was short by 30,170,000 yuan. Dadeheng Native Bank's required cash reserve from October 10th to 16th was 34,000,000 yuan, but it was short by 20,050,000 yuan. Xiangruixing Native Bank's required cash reserve from October 12th to 16th was 25,600,000 yuan, but it was short by 20,067,000 yuan. The above facts directly violate Article 17 of the "Provisional Measures for the Administration of Private Banks and Native Banks in North China Region," which stipulates that the cash reserve ratio for demand deposits is 10 percent, and for time deposits is 5 percent. This also increases market speculation, expands credit, and easily creates financial risks. In addition to ordering the recovery of loans, tightening operations, and handling cash reserves in accordance with regulations to prevent recurrence, the Financial Committee of the Municipal People's Government has also imposed fines of two to three times the illegal interest earned based on the severity of the violations. Qianxing and Tongyuanxiang were each fined 3,000,000 yuan, Dadeheng was fined 2,500,000 yuan, and Xiangruixing was fined 1,500,000 yuan.

　　京市谦兴等四钱庄
  　非法放款受罚
    【北京讯】本市谦兴、同元祥、大德恒、祥瑞兴四家私营钱庄违反政府法令，大量放款，市人民政府财委会顷已分别情节轻重处以罚金，以儆效尤。该四钱庄自十月十一日至十六日一周间的业务，经中国人民银行北京分行金融管理科严格检查，发现连续向同业大量拆借头寸用于放款达三亿九千零六十二万元之多，且该四钱庄放款总额均已超过存款总额，付现准备金经常不足。如谦兴钱庄不足额最高曾达百分之九十五，该钱庄在十月十二日至十月十六日五天内，付现准备金应为五千七百一十三万余元，实有竟不足四千零六十八万元；同元祥钱庄在十月十一日至十月十六日六天内，付现准备金应为四千一百一十万余元，实有不足三千零十七万元；大德恒钱庄在十月十日至十六日七天内，付现准备金应为三千四百余万元，实有不足二千零五万元；祥瑞兴钱庄在十月十二日至十六日五天内，付现准备金应为二千五百六十余万元，实有不足二千零六十七万元。以上事实直接违背“华北区私营银钱业管理暂行办法”第十七条：付现准备金比例活期存款百分之十；定期存款百分之五的规定，并增加市场投机资金，使信用膨胀，易造成金融风险。市人民政府财委会除分别饬令收回放款，紧缩业务，付现准备金按规定办理，不得再有类似情事外，并根据违法情节，以非法利息为基数，科以两倍到三倍的罚金。计罚谦兴、同元祥各三百万元，大德恒二百五十万元，祥瑞兴一百五十万元。
