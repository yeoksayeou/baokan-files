    Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant Tar Field
    Formulates Large Quantities of Lysol Solution
    For Epidemic Prevention and Disinfection in Various Regions
    [Our Newspaper] The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant's Coking Plant Tar Field, in order to cooperate with epidemic prevention work, has successfully researched and formulated Lysol solution and is stepping up mass production. Since the outbreak of the plague in Chahar, the plant established an epidemic prevention committee, mobilizing various teams to discuss and carry out relevant epidemic prevention matters. Shen Changchi, an engineer in the tar field, painstakingly researched and formulated the disinfectant Lysol solution, which has been successfully developed. Its components meet the standards specified in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia. Engineer Shen also used his spare time to explain the Lysol solution formulation method, its uses, and its effectiveness to the workers, and worked with them day and night in the open air to accelerate the formulation. Five tons have already been produced, and many units have come to the field to collect and use it, which has been widely praised by all parties.

    [Our Newspaper] The plague vaccine stock solution previously stored at the Temple of Heaven Epidemic Prevention Office was completely diluted on the 3rd, yielding more than 2.8 million cubic centimeters of vaccine, which can be used for preventive injections for more than one million people. After the dilution work was temporarily suspended, the staff participated in the cultivation of new vaccines. In the first few days, the bacteria were not accustomed to the new culture medium, and the growth was not very good. The daily harvest did not reach the ideal level, and everyone was very anxious. Many methods were devised to increase the nutrients in the culture medium. After three or four days of effort, the bacteria are now growing very well. It is estimated that 500,000 to 600,000 cubic centimeters can be produced daily in a week.

    石景山钢铁厂焦油场
    配制大量来苏药水
    供各地防疫消毒
    【本报讯】石景山钢铁厂炼焦厂焦油场，为配合防疫工作，研究、配制来苏药水成功，正加紧大量制造。自察北鼠疫发生后，该厂成立了防疫委员会，动员各小组讨论并进行有关防疫事宜，焦油场工程师沈昌炽即苦心研究配制消毒剂来苏药水，已研究成功，其成分合乎中华药典上所规定的标准。沈工程师并利用业余时间，给职工讲述来苏药水配制法及其用途与效能，与工友们不分昼夜在露天中加紧配制。刻下已制成五吨，已有许多单位来场领取使用，深获各方面的赞扬。

    【本报讯】天坛防疫处以前所存鼠疫菌苗原液，已于三日全部稀释完毕，共得二百八十余万公撮菌苗，可供一百多万人预防注射用。稀释工作暂时停止后，工作人员即参加培制新菌苗工作，开头的几天，细菌不习惯新的培养基，生长情形不大好，每天收获达不到理想程度，大家都非常着急，想了许多办法增加培养基的养料，经过三四天的努力，现在细菌已经长得很好了，预计在一星期后每天可以出到五六十万公撮。
