　　Conscientiously Serving the People
  　Jiangxi Holds Meetings of Representatives from All Sectors and Farmer Representatives
    Pressing Issues such as Suppressing Bandits and Opposing Local Tyrants Are Resolved Swiftly Based on Actual Circumstances
    Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 26th—Since Jiangxi Province held meetings of people's representatives from all sectors and farmer representatives in various localities, work has been rapidly unfolding. As of November 15th, all counties in the province and one-third to two-thirds of the districts and a few townships have successively convened meetings of people's representatives from all sectors and farmer representatives. At the county-level people's representative meetings and the district and township farmer representative meetings, most of the pressing issues that the people urgently demanded to be resolved, such as suppressing bandits, opposing local tyrants, reducing rent and interest, repairing dikes and controlling water, production for disaster relief, and rational burden for the autumn harvest, were resolved based on local actual conditions. The meetings of people's representatives from all sectors and farmer representatives have been generally welcomed by the people in various localities and have changed the general public's misconceptions about the representative meetings before the meetings, recognizing that the representative meetings are for serving the people. At least 50,000 representatives participated in the county, district, and township representative meetings in various localities. After the meetings, most of these representatives were able to actively convey the resolutions to the broad masses of people and actively promote various tasks around the government, and they achieved great results. After the representatives of the First District of Jinxian County returned to their villages, they convened farmer meetings in forty-three Bao within two days to convey the various resolutions of the district farmer representative meetings, and assisted work teams in organizing farmers' associations in ten Bao. On the third day, they reported the situation to the district government, reporting on the behavior of landlords evading burdens and secretly selling property at night. After the Nanchang Sub-district convened meetings of people's representatives from all sectors and farmer representatives, the number of members of the farmers' association and militia members increased from 8,400 to 30,000; the number of new cadres participating in rural work expanded from 380 to 1,482. Yichun Sub-district has launched the work of opposing local tyrants in one-third of the district, developed more than 40,000 members of farmers' associations, and cultivated 6,400 peasant activists. At the same time, the meetings of people's representatives from all sectors and farmer representatives in various localities have also educated the cadres, corrected some cadres' erroneous views of neglecting the representative meetings, especially after the workers and peasants criticized some inappropriate work measures with the responsible spirit of masters and actively put forward suggestions, which strengthened the cadres' sense of responsibility for serving the people and their confidence in completing tasks. The empiricism and petty work style of some cadres have also been gradually corrected as a result. At present, some cadres in some areas still have two kinds of biases in their understanding of the representative meetings: one is that they still lack due attention to the representative meetings, thinking that the representative meetings are "just for publicity." Therefore, there are bound to be deviations in the leadership of the representative meetings: such as the person in charge giving lengthy reports, too little time for discussion, and failure to fully promote democracy; the representation is not broad enough, manifested in too few middle peasant representatives in some areas, and failure to pay attention to absorbing intellectual representatives to participate, etc. Another bias is that they believe that the representative meetings are omnipotent, and everything will be fine after the representative meetings are held, but they do not organize representatives to convey the resolutions and promote work. These two biases have been noted by the leading organs at all levels, and they have instructed cadres at all levels to correct them in future work.

　　认真给老百姓办事
  　江西各地召开各界代表、农民代表会议
    剿匪、反恶霸等迫切问题均根据实际情况迅速解决
    【新华社南昌二十六日电】江西省各地召开各界人民代表会议与农民代表会议后，工作迅速展开。截至十一月十五日止，全省各县及三分之一到三分之二的区和少数乡，均已先后召开各界人民代表会议及农民代表会议。在县各界人民代表会议和区乡农民代表会议上均根据当地实际情况解决了大多数人民所迫切要求解决的剿匪、反恶霸、减租减息、修堤治水、生产救灾及秋征合理负担等问题。各界人民代表会议和农民代表会议普遍受到各地人民的欢迎，并改变了一般人在开会之前对代表会议的错误看法，认识到代表会议是给老百姓办事的。各地参加县区乡代表会议的代表至少有五万人，这些代表于会后大多都能积极地向广大人民传达决议，并围绕在政府周围积极推行各种工作，且获得很大成绩。进贤县一区代表回乡后，两天内就在四十三个保里召开农民大会，传达区农民代表会议的各项决议，并在十个保里协助工作队组织农会，第三天就向区政府汇报情况，报告地主逃避负担及黑夜偷卖财物等行为。南昌分区在召开各界人民代表会议和农民代表会议后，农会会员及自卫队员从八千四百人增加至三万人；农村中参加工作的新干部从三八零人扩大为一四八二人。宜春分区已在全区三分之一地区展开了反恶霸的工作，发展了四万多农会会员，并培养了六千四百个农民积极分子。各地的各界人民代表会议和农民代表会议同时又教育了干部，纠正了某些干部忽视代表会议的错误看法，特别是工人农民以主人翁负责的精神批评了某些不合宜的工作措施和积极地提出建议后，使干部加强了对人民服务的责任心和完成任务的信心。某些干部的经验主义、及小手小脚的工作作风，也因此得以逐渐纠正。目前有些地区干部对代表会议的认识还存在两种偏向：一种是对代表会议还缺乏应有的重视，认为代表会议是“宣传宣传而已”。因之，对于代表会议的领导就不免发生偏差：如负责人作冗长报告，讨论时间太少，不能充分发扬民主；代表性不广泛，表现在有些地区中农代表太少，不注意吸收知识分子代表参加等等。另一种偏向是认为代表会议万能，开过代表会议就万事大吉，而不去组织代表传达决议，推动工作。这两种偏向已为各级领导机关所注意，并指示各级干部在今后工作中纠正。
