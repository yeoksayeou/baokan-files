    New Teacher-Student Relationship Established at the Affiliated High School of Beijing Normal University
    Cui Yongchang
    Before the liberation of Beijing, the relationship between teachers and students in our school was very distant. During class, teachers lectured, and students listened; as soon as the bell rang, teachers went their way, and students went theirs. Even the few progressive teachers found it difficult to connect with students generally.

    In the early days after the liberation of Beijing, due to misunderstandings of freedom and democracy by both teachers and students, there was a period of liberalism and laxity in the school. During this time, a correct teacher-student relationship was not established. Some students believed that the teachers were not progressive in their thinking, did not understand new knowledge, and there was nothing to be learned from them, so they didn't attend classes. Some teachers didn't care either, adopting a hands-off approach with the attitude of "it's up to you whether you come or not, you'll suffer the consequences later, don't blame me." This had a significant impact on the students' learning.

    Soon after, Yucai Middle School was merged into our school, and they brought many good experiences to the Affiliated High School, and the teacher-student relationship was one of them. After several months of practice, we gained the experience that to improve the teacher-student relationship, we must first live together.

    After school started this time, we accepted the experience of Yucai Middle School and opened a brand-new chapter in the teacher-student relationship. Based on the principle that "teachers can only understand the needs of students and solve their problems by living with them," the school implemented a specialized system, enabling teachers to concentrate all their energy on working in one school. At the same time, a grade-level teacher system was implemented, where grade-level teachers not only helped students with their studies but also helped them solve problems in their lives, thus dispelling the estrangement between students and teachers. In addition, mutual aid groups were formed by teachers teaching each class to fully understand the lives of students. This laid the foundation for establishing a correct teacher-student relationship in the process of helping students progress.

    At the beginning of the semester, the teachers of each subject explained their teaching materials and methods, solicited students' opinions, and set plans, thus starting a planned learning process that our school had never had before.

    While the students were studying, the teachers also engaged in learning. They connected it to their own work and studied "The Political and Ideological Education of Soviet Students." They also formed groups according to their subject area and implemented the "going down to the countryside" method, which meant that teachers of the same subject observed each other's classes and then critiqued each other to improve teaching methods. In addition to studying their profession, the teachers also worked hard to study scientific theories, as one teacher said, "If you don't study scientific theories, you can't lead young people." Every day, one and a half hours before class, the teachers engaged in group study, and in the past few days, they also held a surprise exam.

    Teachers and students living together allowed the students to break the mentality of "being afraid of teachers," and both sides felt particularly close. The students were very concerned about their studies and actively offered suggestions at any time. And the teachers could correct the students' mistakes at any time. When the phenomenon of "valuing science over the humanities" occurred among the students, all the teachers in the school concentrated their efforts to correct this bias and carried out persuasive education among the students. When students neglected their health, the teachers encouraged them to exercise more and play more ball games. When the weather turned cold, they reminded students to pay attention to adding clothes. Such care made every student feel so warm. The teachers also learned from the students and benefited from mutual learning.

    师大附中建立了新的师生关系
    崔永昌
    在北京解放以前，我们学校的先生与同学之间的关系是很疏远的，上课的时候，先生来讲课，学生来听课；下课钟一响，先生走先生的，学生走学生的。即便有个别进步教员，也是很难和学生普遍接近。
    北京解放后的初期，由于先生与同学们对自由民主的误解，学校里一度发生自由散漫的偏向。这时候，正确的师生关系也没有建立。部分同学认为先生思想不进步，不了解新知识，跟他们学不到什么，而不去上课。有一部分先生也不管，抱着“爱上不上，将来吃亏不怨我”的态度，而对同学采取了大撒手的办法。这样，对同学们的学习影响很大。
    不久，育才中学合并进来了，他们为附中带来了许多好的经验，师生关系就是其中的一个。经过几个月的实践，使我们得到一个经验，要搞好师生关系首先就要生活在一起。
    这次开学以后，我们接受了育才中学的经验，在师生关系上打开了一个崭新的局面，根据“先生只有与同学生活在一起，才能了解同学的需要，解决同学的问题”这个原则，学校便实行了专任制，使先生能够集中全副精力在一个学校里工作。同时并实行了级任制，级任先生不但要帮助同学学习，并且还要帮助同学解决生活问题；这样，打消了同学与先生之间的隔阂。此外，并由各班任课的先生组成互助小组，来全面的了解同学的生活。这就为建立正确的师生帮助同学进步的过程中，老关系打下了基础。
    在刚开学的时候，各科先生便说出了他们的教材与教学方法，征求同学的意见，定出计划，这样开始了我校从来没有过的有计划的学习。
    在同学进行学习时，先生也展开了学习。他们联系着自己的业务，学习“苏联学生的政治思想教育”。并按业务组成了小组，实行了“下乡”的办法，就是教同科的先生互相听课，然后互相批评，以求改进教学方法。除了学习业务以外，先生们还很努力地学习科学理论，正如一位先生说：“如果不学习科学理论，那就不能领导青年。”每天在上课前一个半钟头，先生们便展开小组学习，并且在前几天还举行了一次突击考试。
    先生与同学生活在一起，使同学们打破了“怕先生”的心理，双方都感到特别亲切。同学们对学习都很关心，随时主动地提意见。而先生也能随时纠正同学的错误。当同学中间发生了“重理轻文”的现象时，全校的老师便集中全力纠正这偏向，向同学进行说服教育。当同学忽视了健康的时候，先生们便鼓励同学多运动、多玩球。当天气变冷的时候，他们便让同学注意衣服的增添。这样的关心，使每一个同学全感到那么亲热。在老师师也向同学学习，得到了互相学习之益。
