Black Stone Slope Coal Mine Chronicles (33)
    Kang Tuo
    All along, Qian Danao had been telling people in meetings that everyone had a cornucopia. For those who farmed, this cornucopia was called "soldiers and farmers united"; for those who worked in the mines, it was called "soldiers and workers united"; for those who traded, it was called "soldiers and merchants united." But how exactly to "unite"? Before long, a blockhouse was built on the northern slope of the village. The blockhouse asked the village for white flour every day, and asked the women for comfort eggs and shoes; the apportionment of funds was based on land ownership, and there were also seasonal payments. Those without houses or land were asked to pay a "no property fee." The corvée labor was even more frequent, happening every few days. Later, the whole village was reorganized into large groups, with men between the ages of seventeen and forty-five forming groups of six. Each group had to provide one "regular soldier" and one "reserve soldier." Those who didn't go to the army had to provide preferential grain and cotton for those who did. But after the groups were formed, people were still randomly seized for military service. Even families without able-bodied men or those who weren't organized into groups were asked to provide preferential treatment grain, causing chaos! Yu Bao was still the village policeman, and Niu Bao went to the blockhouse as a member of the self-defense corps. Niu Bao's sister-in-law's job was only renamed as a women's affairs officer… Shuan Cheng ran away with his brothers to avoid conscription. Da San was still in the village, but by the following year, it was rumored that all the land in the village would be transformed into some kind of "share land," and only those who were organized into agricultural groups could receive "share land" to cultivate. Qian Danao even arbitrarily designated certain people as "mine bosses," and mine bosses wouldn't be given land to cultivate, making it so that no one in the village could farm in peace. Ju Bao took advantage of the fact that the mine bosses had no livelihood and hired people to dig two small earthen kilns for very low wages, but no one asked about the big kiln. Here, Da San was designated as a mine boss and wasn't given land to cultivate. He couldn't find anyone to hire him to work in the mines, and he refused to work for Ju Bao's earthen kilns, so he just stayed put, eating and drinking sporadically. One time, he ran into Xi Lu. He saw that Xi Lu was also icy cold. He looked at him for a long time and asked, "Why are you so thin?" He said, "Thin? How can I not be thin without food and drink?" Xi Lu shook his head and said, "Sigh, it's all the same! We're better off than you, but now that the land has been allocated to share land, two of my little ones have been seized to be soldiers. Not only does my family have no one to pay for preferential treatment grain, but we also have to pay for others! Look at this! This is still called 'Chinese Renaissance'! Da San, why are you staying here to suffer this misery! Why don't you just go out and wander around!" Da San didn't say anything, and walked back to his earthen cave dwelling in a daze. He saw that Tian Lu's family was sitting there silently with worried faces. Feeling weak, he went to the Fourth Mine again.
    At the Fourth Mine, he ran into Shuan Cheng. Shuan Cheng and a group of young men from nearby villages who were hiding from conscription had dug secret earthen cellars in a deep gully south of the mining area. Da San also moved over there. Da San asked Shuan Cheng, "Do you still know anything about the news from the mountains?" Shuan Cheng said, "Ever since the Yan army occupied Yinying, no one who communicates with the mountains can be found." Da San felt cold all over again when he heard this. Looking around the cellar, he saw that the same traitors from the past were still in power. There were even fewer rules in the cellar than during the Japanese occupation. Mining was still done using the "longwall method" like during the Japanese occupation, focusing only on the convenience of extracting coal, and the passageways were dug five or six zhang wide without any support timber. If workers were crushed to death, no one cared. The ventilation shafts weren't maintained, and fires often broke out, burning the miners to death, and no one paid attention either. Most of the miners who had some skill were listlessly working and resting intermittently. Da San just went along with it, working for a couple of days and then spending his wages on drinking and looking for women. When he ran out of money, he would work for a while again. Shuan Cheng sometimes tried to talk to him kindly, but he ignored him, just staring blankly, as if he had no desires at all.

　　黑石坡煤窑演义（３３）
    康濯
    从来干大脑又开会告给人们，说聚宝盆人人有，养种地的，这盆就叫兵农合一，下窑的叫兵工合一，作买卖的叫兵商合一。可又怎么“合一”呀！不久，村里北坡顶上却安了个炮楼，炮楼上天天问村里要白面，问妇女要慰劳鸡蛋和鞋；摊款是按地摊分，并且也有季款，没房没地的就叫出“无财产款”，应差出夫更是三天两头有；后来全村又大编组，十七岁到四十五岁的男人，六人一组，一组出一个“常备兵”和一个“预备兵”，不出去当兵的就给出去的拿优特粮和棉花，但编了组以后，出兵又是乱抓，没有壮年也没编组的人家却也叫了优待粮，闹得天昏地暗！村里玉宝也还是村警，牛宝上炮楼当了自卫团，牛宝他嫂的差事也只换了个名，叫妇女干事……拴成是领着他兄弟躲兵跑了，大三倒还在村里呆着，但到第二年，就真的听说要把浑村的土地都化成什么“份地”，编了农组的人才能领上“份地”种，干大脑还信口指定谁谁是窑黑，窑黑就不给地种，闹得谁家养种也不安生，聚宝却趁那会窑黑们没营生，只花很低的工资，召人又刨了两座小土窑，大窑却还是没人问。这里大三被人家指定是窑黑，不给地种，下窑吧也没人寻他，聚宝的土窑他又怎么也不去给干，只好呆着，吃喝也有一顿没一顿。有一回，他碰见喜禄，只见喜禄也是冰凉冰凉地，看了他半天，问他道：“你怎么这么瘦？”他说“瘦？没吃喝还能不瘦？”喜禄摇着头说：“唉，一球样！咱比你强吧，可如今地划归了份地，俩小又抓了个去当兵，家里不光没人给掏优待粮，咱还得给人家掏！你看看！这还是“中国复兴”哩！大三，你还呆着受这个罪干什么！还是出去瞎跑跳去吧！”大三没言声，愣愣地走回自己的土窑洞，只见天禄一家子正愁眉苦脸不声不响地呆着。浑身没劲，就又去了四矿。
    在四矿又碰见拴成。拴成和左近各村一帮子躲兵的青年，在矿区南边一道深沟里，刨了秘密土窖住着，大三也就搬了过去。大三问拴成道：“还知道山里边的讯么？”拴成说：“自打阎军占了荫营，跟山里通气的人一个也寻不见了。”大三一听，又是浑身发冷。窖底下看看，也还是过去那些汉奸们当权，窖里比日本鬼子那会还没规章，刨炭还跟日本那会一样，用的“长壁法”，只管出炭方便，把行道刨得五丈六丈宽，又不支顶木，砸死工人人家也不管，风筒也不拾掇，短不了起火烧死窑黑，也一样没人理睬；窑黑里头有两下把式的，大多是没劲没劲地干干歇歇。大三也就稀里糊途，动弹两天，领了工资便喝喝酒，寻寻女人，没钱了又再干一阵。拴成有时也好言好语跟他捣拉两句，他却爱理不理，傻愣傻愣地，好象他是什么想望头也没有了。
