　　Opening of After-School Tutoring Schools
　　Resolution of the Beijing People's Representative Conference
　　[Beijing News] At the Beijing Second People's Representative Conference on the 22nd, a resolution was passed regarding the opening of after-school tutoring schools. The original text is as follows: In order to meet the learning needs of workers and cadres and improve their cultural level and work skills, it is decided to establish a formal after-school school in this city. Using a unified leadership and decentralized teaching method, schools of various levels (higher, middle, and primary) and classes of various grades and courses will be established. Currently, the focus should be on opening middle and primary schools, but some university classes should also be opened. All levels of schools should establish appropriate academic systems, implement an examination system, and issue certificates with the same validity as formal schools based on students' academic performance. Teachers for the after-school schools should be hired from all fields who are fully qualified, and they should be given appropriate compensation based on the level and amount of courses they teach. In terms of equipment, existing public facilities such as schools, government offices, factories, and other facilities that can be used should be utilized as much as possible. Students should be given preferential discounts on the textbooks they need.

　　At the beginning of the establishment of after-school schools, workers and staff should be recruited first. After some success is achieved and experience is gained, it should be gradually promoted.

    业余学校开办之始，应先招收工人和工作人员入学，待办理稍有成效，取得经验后，再逐渐推广之。
