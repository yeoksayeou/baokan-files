Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 11th: Moscow Dispatch: The just-published issue 46 of the New Era magazine carries an article by Leonidov discussing the Soviet Union's fraternal and selfless aid to people's democratic countries, including the introduction of experience in socialist construction. Leonidov writes: The Soviet people, who are realizing a gradual transition to communism, have generously opened the treasure trove of their experience to all working humanity, especially to the people's democratic countries. The working people of Romania and Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia and Poland, Hungary and Albania, widely draw experience from the great treasure house of Soviet experience and, after considerable deliberation, apply it to their own specific and unique national conditions. The Soviet people's historically significant experience in building communism is being utilized in the East and the West. The leaders of the People's Republic of China are absorbing and have victoriously implemented the Soviet experience of Stalin's socialist industrialization plan in order to formulate an outline for China's economic reconstruction, and to implement China's economic reconstruction after China is completely liberated from the rule of the running dog of the American imperialists—the reactionary regime of Chiang Kai-shek.

    新时代杂志论文指出
    苏以建设社会主义经验慷慨援助人民民主国家
    【新华社北京十一日电】莫斯科讯：刚刚出版的第四十六期新时代杂志刊载里昂尼多夫写的一篇文章，论述苏联对人民民主国家的兄弟般的与大公无私的援助，这一援助包括介绍建设社会主义的经验在内。里昂尼多夫写道：正在实现逐渐过渡到共产主义的苏联人民，业已慷慨地向全体劳动人类，首先向人民民主国家打开了他们经验的宝库。罗马尼亚与保加利亚、捷克斯洛伐克与波兰、匈牙利与阿尔巴尼亚的劳动人民，从苏联经验的伟大宝库中广泛地吸取经验，经相当的熟虑之后，运用到他们自己具体的特殊的国情上。苏联人民建设共产主义的有历史意义的经验，正被利用到东方和西方。中华人民共和国的领袖们，吸取着并业已胜利地履行了斯大林社会主义工业化计划的苏联经验，以便制订中国经济重建的大纲，在中国完全从美帝国主义者的走狗——蒋介石反动政权之统治下解放后实行中国的经济重建。
