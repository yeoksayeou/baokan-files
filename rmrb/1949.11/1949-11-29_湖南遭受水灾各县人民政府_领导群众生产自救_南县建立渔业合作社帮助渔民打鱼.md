Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 27th: The People's Governments of various counties in Hunan Province that have suffered from floods this year are actively leading the disaster-stricken people in production for self-relief. Many counties in the Changsha, Changde, Yiyang and other regions of Hunan Province have suffered from floods this year, especially the lakeside counties of Changde, Li County, Yiyang, Anxiang, Hanshou, Linxiang, Yueyang, Xiangyin, Huarong, Yuanjiang, and Nan County, which have suffered more severely, with the affected area accounting for about 30 percent of the total land. After the liberation of Hunan, while carrying out the work of suppressing bandits and raising food to support the front lines, the local people's governments actively helped the disaster-stricken people to carry out production for self-relief. The People's Governments of Nan County, Yiyang and other counties first invited representatives of the disaster-stricken people to hold meetings. In addition to educating the masses to dispel the ideas of resignation to fate and waiting for relief, they also studied specific methods for carrying out production. Nan County also organized a disaster relief committee composed of representatives of disaster-stricken people, enlightened gentry, and some cadres. All counties have led the disaster-stricken people to carry out various types of production based on local conditions. Yiyang, Hanshou, Nan County and other lakeside areas called on the disaster-stricken people to fish for production. The governments of Hanshou, Nan County and other places officially announced that disaster-stricken people are exempt from taxes for fishing in public lakes. At the same time, they also helped fishermen establish fishery cooperatives to avoid intermediate exploitation by fishing firms. Some disaster-stricken areas in Changsha, Yiyang and other counties, under the call of the People's Government, planted late rice after the flood receded and obtained 60 to 70 percent of the harvest. In order to carry out production and disaster relief movements in the disaster areas and prevent spring famine, Pingjiang County specially distributed 70,000 catties of interest-free disaster relief food loans. The Changsha Prefectural Commissioner's Office also issued production loans to help disaster-stricken people in various places engage in production such as weaving mats and transportation.

  　领导群众生产自救
    南县建立渔业合作社帮助渔民打鱼
    【新华社长沙二十七日电】湖南省今年遭受水灾的各县人民政府，正积极领导灾民进行生产自救。湖南长沙、常德、益阳等分区今年有不少县份遭受水灾，其中尤以滨湖的常德、澧县、益阳、安乡、汉寿、临湘、岳阳、湘阴、华容、沅江、南县等县受灾较重，受灾面积约占全部土地的百分之三十。湖南解放以后，各地人民政府在进行剿匪、筹粮支援前线等工作的同时，即积极帮助灾民进行生产自救。南县、益阳等县人民政府首先邀集灾民代表举行会议，除教育群众打消听天由命和坐待救济的思想外，并研究进行生产的具体办法。南县并组织了由灾民和开明士绅代表及一部分干部所组成的救灾委员会。各县都根据本地具体条件领导灾民进行各式各样的生产。滨湖的益阳、汉寿、南县等地号召灾民打鱼生产，汉寿、南县等地政府应正式公布灾民在公湖打渔免税，同时并帮助渔民建立了渔业合作社，避免渔行的中间剥削。长沙、益阳等县的某些受灾地区，曾在人民政府的号召下，在水退以后种上了晚稻，得到六、七成的收获。平江县为了在灾区开展生产救灾运动，预防春荒，特发放了七万斤无利救灾贷粮。长沙专署也发放了生产贷粮，扶助各地灾民从事编席、运输等生产。
