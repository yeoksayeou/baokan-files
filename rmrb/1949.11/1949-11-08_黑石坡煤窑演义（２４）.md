    Let's return to the story of Xi Lu, who, even when he was sick, couldn't help but ask about the affairs of the coal mine; his family always told him that the mine was doing well and that he should rest and recuperate. After a month or so, he was almost recovered and able to get out of bed. One day, he asked his second son, "What exactly is going on at the mine? Your old man is almost better, and you're still hiding it from me?" His second son was a little flustered and stammered, "The mine... nothing's wrong..." Xi Lu suddenly became angry, his body still weak, his face pale and yellow but flushed with red, and he clapped his hands and shouted, "You motherfucking beast! You're taking advantage of my illness, making your own decisions and reopening the ventilation shaft, but before the shaft was even open, the mine flooded! And now the village is in an uproar about offending the Old Lord, causing unrest throughout the village, and you think I don't know anything?" This scared his second son speechless! Xi Lu kept asking him, "Are you still going to lie to me?" He could only tremble and say, "The reopening of the ventilation shaft wasn't... wasn't done by us brothers, it... it was old man Ju Bao..." Xi Lu said, "What about him? He made the decision, right? But are you all dead? If he made the decision, let him take responsibility! Why wait until I'm better to figure out how to deal with it? A bunch of motherfucking beasts! Let me tell you, nothing you've whispered has escaped my ears! Hmph! If I hadn't been trying so hard to bear it, I would have died of anger long ago!" He clenched his fists tightly, as if he wanted to hit his second son.
    Just then, someone walked in, and his second son, as if saved, immediately called out, "Yu Bao!" It was indeed Yu Bao who had come. Xi Lu immediately asked Yu Bao, "What are you doing here?" Yu Bao had never seen Xi Lu angry before, and seeing him like this, he didn't know what was going on and could only answer softly, "I'm here to ask if you're feeling better!" Xi Lu said, "I'm not feeling better, unless I'm dead, right? Hmph! You're here to inquire about how to deal with the mine's problems! Am I right?" Yu Bao said, "The mine? How... the wind is strong..." Xi Lu interrupted, "You're lying to me too? Let me tell you, I knew it all along! Ever since I got sick, Ju Bao decided to let you reopen the ventilation shaft, and you dug out water and flooded the mine! Ju Bao will have to take responsibility for this mine! I don't care!" Yu Bao had been sent by Ju Bao to sound him out, but he didn't expect this reception. He could only stammer, "Look at this... your health is important, you... you can't get angry..." Xi Lu interrupted again, "What am I getting angry about? If I let my anger get the better of me, I would have died of anger long ago! Let me tell you, I was blind, I mistook Ju Bao for a good man! He forced me to take on Dali's debt! He decided to flood my mine! And now it's a matter of Da San offending the Old Lord! Let him find Da San to pay with his life! What are you waiting for me for? You motherfucker, I think you, Yu Bao, are in cahoots with Ju Bao! What are you asking me for? Don't come looking for me anymore. Go, go, go! Go tell Ju Bao! Tell him everything I've said! Just say that I'm not sick and I'm not crazy, a good man said it himself! You motherfucker, if I can't win, then it's just my life! If that doesn't work, then it's just my few acres of land and that small shop! What am I afraid of? Go, Yu Bao, go tell him! You're not leaving yet? Is there anything else to say?" Xi Lu shouted from inside the house to the yard, and kept chasing Yu Bao away. Yu Bao had no choice but to leave with a red face, but he secretly winked at Xi Lu's second son, wanting him to come out and say a few words; unexpectedly, Xi Lu saw this wink, and he shouted again, "Yu Bao, do you really have something else to say? Go on! If I don't ask Ju Bao to compensate for the mine, that's already a great act of filial piety towards him! That's just how I am." After saying that, Xi Lu chased his second son back into the house. At this point, Bian Xiao came out, and he waved his hand to tell Yu Bao to leave quickly, while persuading Xi Lu to go back and rest.
    Xi Lu was sick for a few more days after this outburst. While sick, he thought about the incident and regretted it a little, fearing that it would be difficult to handle if he really fell out with Ju Bao; but he couldn't suppress the anger in his chest, and he didn't want to back down for a moment. He didn't make any noise, thinking that Yu Bao might come again to smooth things over. Who knew that after Xi Lu got angry, Yu Bao didn't dare to tell Ju Bao everything Xi Lu said, but he couldn't withstand Ju Bao's questioning. Ju Bao scolded him again, and he was so angry that he told Ju Bao everything Xi Lu had said while he was angry; at the time, Ju Bao was lying on the kang smoking opium, and when he heard Yu Bao's account, he immediately threw down his opium pipe, sat up, his face as black as coal, and his nostrils flared, scaring Yu Bao back three steps, and even Bai Quanjia, who had come to bring Ju Bao water, ran away; however, Ju Bao didn't say anything at the time, only waved his hand at Yu Bao, and Yu Bao quickly left. Afterwards, Ju Bao sent Qian Danao to find Xi Lu, simply telling him to consider going to the commune to discuss how to deal with the big mine. Xi Lu was both angry and afraid, and he only procrastinated, saying, "Let's talk about it when I get better!" Qian Danao said, "When you get better, you have to tell my uncle immediately!" After saying that, he left. Here, Xi Lu thought about it over and over again, but he couldn't swallow his hatred for Ju Bao. After he recovered from his illness, he secretly went to Yangquan, wanting to delay with Ju Bao for a few days, vent his anger, and plan to raise some money to pay off Ju Bao's loan from Liugou before talking about anything else. But his shop in Yangquan, because he and his wife didn't know how to manage it, was in a state of half-dead, and he couldn't raise a single cent! He couldn't help but feel a surge of anger and made a firm decision: just not to care about the mine's affairs! Let the mine go to hell!

　　黑石坡煤窑演义（２４）
    康濯
    再说喜禄在闹病的时候，也短不了问讯窑上的事；他家里的人却总是告他：窑很好，叫他安心养息。过了个把月，他病快好了，能下炕了，这天他就问他二小道：“窑上到底怎么啦？你老子病都好了，你还瞒着我么？”他二小有点心慌，吞吞吐吐道：“窑没……没啥……”喜禄突然生了气，他身子还很虚，又黄又白的脸上却透出一片红，拍着巴掌嚷道：“你他妈个牲口！你们欺负老子病了，自己作主又透风筒，可风筒没透就把窑淹了！这会村里又闹什么大三得罪了老君爷，折腾得浑村不安的，你们只当我真不知道？”这可把他二小吓得说不出话！喜禄却还一个劲问他：“你他妈还要瞒哄我么？”他只得哆嗦着说：“后底透风筒可……可不是咱弟兄，那……那可是聚宝老人家……”喜禄道：“他怎么？他作主的是不？可你们都是死人啦？他作主的就让他担待呗！为什么还要等我好了再想法对付？真他妈一群牲口！告你说，你们悄悄说道的都没逃过我这耳朵！哼！要不是我使劲忍着，我早他妈气上加病死球了哩！”他使劲勒着拳头，真象要打他二小。
    这时外边有什么人走进来，他二小象得救一般马上叫那人道：“玉宝！”果真是玉宝来了。喜禄劈面就问玉宝道：“你来干什么？”玉宝是从来没见过喜禄生气的，一见这模样，不知怎么回事，只得轻声答道：“问讯你老人家好些不！”喜禄道：“我不好些，莫非我死球了么？哼！你是来打问窑上的事怎么对付的！是呀不？”玉宝说：“窑？怎么……这会风硬……”喜禄抢着道：“你也瞒哄我？告你说，我早知道啦！自打我病了，聚宝又作主让你再透风筒，你就刨出水淹了窑！这窑可得聚宝担待！我不管！”玉宝本是聚宝叫他来探探风声的，不想却碰了个这，只得支吾道：“你看这这……你老人家身子要紧，可……可不敢动火……”喜禄又抢着道：“我动什么火？我要动肝火，我早气死球啦！告你说，我瞎了眼，我错把聚宝当了好人！他逼着我背大利！他作主淹了我的窑！这会又是大三得罪了老君爷！可他寻大三低命呗！还等我干什么？你他妈的，我看玉宝你也是跟聚宝一鼻孔窜连的！你问我干什么？往后你可别找我了。去去去！去告聚宝吧！就把我这说的通告给他！就说我没病没疯，咱一人好人亲口说的！你他妈的，拼不过就是这条命！再不行也就是我那几亩地跟那小铺！我怕什么？去呀，玉宝，告他去！你还不走？还有说的？”喜禄从屋里嚷到院里，并一个劲撵玉宝，玉宝没法，只得红着脸往外走，但他还偷偷给喜禄他二小使眼色，想叫他二小出去捣拉两句；不想这眼色也被喜禄见了，他就又嚷道：“玉宝你真个还有说的？走吧！我不叫聚宝赔窑就算是老大的孝敬他哩！我就是这个。”说完，喜禄又把他二小往屋里撵。这时扁小出来了，他才挥着手让玉宝快走，一边好说赖说地拉喜禄回去歇着。
    喜禄生了这场气，又病得躺了几天。闹病当中，他想起这场事，也有点后悔，怕真个跟聚宝闹翻了不好办；但他实在压不下胸头的闷火，一时也不肯拐湾，他就没声张，想着玉宝许会再来圆转的。谁知玉宝自从喜禄生气以后，虽说一时也不敢把喜禄的话都告聚宝，无奈他搁不住聚宝的逼问，聚宝又训了他一顿，他心中没好气，就把喜禄生气的一片话都告给了；当时聚宝正躺在炕上抽大烟，一听玉宝学说的话，立时把大烟枪一撂，翻身坐起，一脸乌黑，两个鼻孔直出大气，吓得玉宝倒退三步，连给聚宝送水来的白泉家也吓跑了；不过聚宝当时倒没说什么，只对玉宝一挥手，玉宝赶紧走了。事后，聚宝却打发乾大脑找喜禄，干脆叫他盘算着上社里商议对付大窑的事，喜禄是又气又怕，只推拖道：赶我好了再说吧！”乾大脑说：“你好了可得立时告给我叔哩！”说完他就走了。这里喜禄左右盘算，总咽不下恨聚宝的这口气，他就在病好了以后偷偷地去了阳泉，想跟聚宝拖两天，也给自己出口气，并打算筹划几个钱，把聚宝转借柳沟的款项还清了再说别的。但他阳泉的小铺，因为大小不会经管，给闹得个半死不活的，一个款也筹不出！他不禁浑身冒火，就狠狠地拿定了个主意：干脆不管窑上的事！窑也撂球它算了。
