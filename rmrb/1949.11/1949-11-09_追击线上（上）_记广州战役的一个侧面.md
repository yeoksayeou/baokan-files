On the Pursuit Line (Part 1)
    ——A Side View of the Guangzhou Campaign
    By Our Special Correspondent Du Zhanchao
    On September 23rd, just as the Kuomintang bandit Central News Agency shamelessly boasted, "Our troops are on full alert at Meiguan," our heroic People's Liberation Army (PLA) had already crossed the Meiling Pass, opened the northern Guangdong gateway of Nanxiong and Shixing, and, together with the main force that had advanced towards Wengyuan and the mountainous areas along the Guangdong-Hunan border, formed a multi-pronged siege on Qujiang. This frightened the Jiang-Bai bandit gang into hastily dispatching its 46th Army southward along the Guangdong-Hankou Railway in order to jointly "defend" this strategic strongpoint in northern Guangdong with its 39th and 63rd Armies. However, just as this bandit army had rushed to Lecheng, a hundred or so miles north of Qujiang, our large force on the Central China Front launched a powerful offensive in the Hengyang area, forcing it to retreat hastily north. At this time, our Southern Line Corps took the opportunity to seize Qujiang with a forced march of 130 li. Subsequently, it advanced southward, successively capturing the cities of Fogang, Yingde, and Huaxian, and controlled the entire Guangdong-Hankou Railway line. On the night of October 14th, it victoriously entered Guangzhou City. At the same time, our troops on the eastern and western flanks rapidly cleared out the remaining enemy forces around Guangzhou, and chased after the Jiang-Bai bandit army fleeing west. The Guangzhou Campaign thus came to a victorious end.
    This campaign lasted for more than ten days, and its characteristic was: the Jiang-Bai bandit army was in constant flight under the pursuit of the People's Liberation Army; we, on the other hand, demanded that the enemy be annihilated on the spot as much as possible in every combat action, thus forming an extremely tense pursuit battle. Time—was the primary element of this campaign. In order to gain time, the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army advanced day and night, regardless of wind and rain, directly to Guangzhou. The following are some fragments of records from this advance:
  　1. Night Crossing of Meiguan
    On the tenth day of the southward advance of the troops from central Jiangxi, we saw the towering mountains lying ahead, which was the famous Dayu Mountain. Dayu belongs to the Five Ridges mountain range, spanning the provinces of Guangdong and Jiangxi. On the ridge is the "Meiguan," 1,200 feet above sea level, which is the transportation route from Jiangxi to Guangdong.
    Before climbing Dayu Mountain, we heard many moving stories: the people of Lingnan, longing for the PLA day and night, carefully fried newly harvested peanuts, and then ran to the ridge to wait. When they saw that their own army had not yet arrived, they hurried down the mountain, ate the old peanuts, and fried a new pot to prepare as dry rations for the soldiers. The people climbed Meiling Pass every day and looked north, anxiously asking each other: "Why hasn't the main force arrived yet?"
    Now the People's Liberation Army has finally arrived at Dayu Mountain, and the fighting spirit of our soldiers is uncontrollably encouraged by the enthusiasm of the people. "Instructor, you must let me participate in the battle this time!" said Han Rongyao, the clerk of the artillery company, stubbornly. In front was Liu Jinzhong, a porter from the Third Company, who was carrying a heavy load uphill, but still pestering the company commander and instructor to discuss the conditions for going to the front line. In the dusk, the troops quickly ascended along the rugged mountain road, and when the vanguard reached the Meiling Pass, which stands between the two peaks, with "Southern Guangdong Pass" to the north and "First Pass of Lingnan" to the south, the moon had risen slowly from the east. Under the moonlight, we victoriously joined forces with two People's Armed Forces that insisted on fighting behind enemy lines—the Guangdong-Jiangxi-Hunan Border Column and the Beijiang Second Detachment. "It's right there!" Zhang Hua, the commander of the guerrillas, pointed out to Commander Cui of the Field Army along the mountain: Nanxiong, our first point of attack. Then his members led the comrades of the Field Army across Meiling Pass and advanced rapidly in that direction!
    2. The Battle of Zhenshui
    Nanxiong is located on the banks of the Zhenshui River and is the gateway to northern Guangdong. According to records: "The name 'Xiong' of the prefecture means that it controls the mountains, gathers the Baiyue, and the breath of Lingnan depends on this prefecture." Obviously, to protect Qujiang, it is necessary to defend Nanxiong, so the bandit army did not hesitate to draw out about one division from its limited force to deploy on the Nanxiong-Shixing line, and extended a main force to the front of Dayu Mountain, attempting to control our army's southward advance with a cluster of bunkers.
    After understanding the enemy's situation, the commander made a thorough deployment: Regiment C quickly outflanked the flanks of the enemy's forward fortifications, planning to cut off their retreat; Regiment B bypassed the small road and advanced from the middle to eliminate the defending enemy in the city; Regiment A rushed directly to the Zhenshui River from the left wing, preparing to intercept the enemy reinforcements coming from Shixing in the north. "Strive to fire the first shot!" the soldiers swore, unloading the heavy 60mm guns and mortars from the pack saddles onto their shoulders. In order to complete the 130-li journey and arrive at the Nanxiong city gate before 4:00 AM, as ordered by the forward command post, our troops ran forward along the rugged mountain roads and slippery field paths. When Regiment B advanced to a small village on the highway north of the city, the Jiang bandit garrison was still asleep. When their sentry noticed someone, the PLA had already come to him. Seven or eight shots defeated and captured a whole company of them. It was already 3:40 AM, eight li away from the city, and the troops continued to rush forward. When Regiment B arrived at the East Gate of Nanxiong, the clock pointed to six minutes before four. At this time, we heard that the enemy in the city was gathering to flee, and our First Battalion destroyed the East Gate with explosives, crushing the enemy and occupying the pseudo-county government. The Second Battalion quickly advanced to the Damu Bridge on the Zhenshui River south of the city. At this moment, the enemy in Henan could not wait for its retreating troops in the city, and hurriedly poured a bucket of kerosene and set the bridge on fire. Our Second Battalion Commander led six or seven soldiers to rush across the bridge from the smoke and fire, scaring many Jiang bandit soldiers dumbfounded and surrendering. Our subsequent troops arrived immediately and put out the fire on the bridge.
    That night, the people's soldiers poured through this large wooden bridge, nearly 200 meters long, and advanced along the Zhenshui River towards Shixing. There, two days ago, Rao Jiming, the leader of a Kuomintang regiment, led his team to revolt on the 22nd, killing the pseudo-county magistrate and others on the spot and withdrawing out of the city. This news greatly encouraged our soldiers, who marched day and night, smashed the enemy's position that attempted to resist stubbornly, and the bandit army fled towards Qujiang in a panic, never expecting that our guerrillas and uprising troops were waiting for them ahead.
    3. Seizing Qujiang in Haste
    The victories of Nanxiong and Shixing opened the prelude to the Guangzhou Campaign. The bandit army entrenched in Qujiang was under serious threat, constructing fortifications along the Zhou Tian-Ping Bu line relying on the mountains, attempting to block our army's advance. Our large army had poured into Guangdong and rushed to the areas designated by the forward command post to assemble.
    The news of the successful closing of the People's Political Consultative Conference and the establishment of the Central People's Government encouraged the entire front line. The soldiers swore in front of our solemn five-star national flag: We will resolutely implement Commander-in-Chief Zhu's order, and celebrate the founding anniversary with the liberation of Qujiang and Guangzhou, and offer a gift to Chairman Mao! Tensely completed all combat preparations.
    October 6th was the Mid-Autumn Festival according to the lunar calendar, and our army began to attack Qujiang.
    In order to avoid alarming the enemy around Qujiang and seek to annihilate its active forces before attacking Qujiang City, a lightly armed force of ours inserted into the mountains southwest of Shixing the day before at dusk, advancing in places where no one had ever been before on the cliffs. At night, our commanders and fighters carried their guns on their backs in order to explore the road, set up bamboo ladders on steep places to go up and down, and used their arms instead of feet to slide on the mountains covered with thatch. Our front troops rushed ahead at a speed of 25 li per hour to attack the fleeing enemy, fighting while advancing. The telephone operators connected the wires to the long-distance telephone lines from time to time to report the news to everyone. Now the Qujiang bandit army has fallen into an extremely panicked state. A bandit soldier shouted in panic on the phone: "Here they come! Here they come!" then fell silent. When the bandit army fled, besides the two bridges, the more than a dozen bridges, big and small, were even loaded with explosives but they didn't have time to detonate them before they fled. When our army advanced to the Hedam east of Qujiang City on the morning of the 7th, the last retreating troops of the 63rd Army of the bandit army set fire to the Shaoguan Bridge with gasoline and fled southwest. Our vanguard rushed forward to put out the fire, rescued the bridge, and victoriously occupied Qujiang City.
    That night, rain lashed the Beijiang River. In front of the division's temporary command post, Commander Qin and Political Commissar Gu conveyed the forward command post's combat order: "The enemy has abandoned Qujiang and is fleeing south. We must immediately change from attacking fortifications to pursuing. Wherever the enemy flees, we pursue there, twist together, annihilate one part, and advance towards Guangzhou at double speed!" The advance bugle sounded, and the soldiers jumped up from their resting places, carrying their guns and cannons, advancing in the rain on the slippery railway sleepers all night.

　　追击线上（上）
    ——记广州战役的一个侧面
    本报特约记者  杜展潮
    九月二十三日，正当国民党匪帮中央通讯社无耻吹嘘：“梅关我军严阵以待”的时候，我英勇人民解放军某部已越过了梅岭关，打开粤北大门南雄、始兴，与先行楔入翁源及沿粤湘边境山地向南挺进的大军形成数路夹击曲江之势。吓得蒋白匪帮慌忙调遣其四十六军，沿粤汉铁路南下，以便与其三十九军、六十三军共同“固守”这一粤北战略要点，但当这支匪军刚赶到曲江以北百余里的乐昌时，我华中前线大军已经在衡阳方面展开强大攻势，迫令其仓惶北撤，此时我南线兵团即乘机以一百三十里强行军急取曲江。继即挥戈南进，连克佛岗、英德、花县等城，及控制粤汉路全线，十月十四日夜，胜利进驻广州市。同时，我东西两翼部队，迅速肃清广州外围残敌，尾追西逃蒋白匪军，广州战役遂告胜利结束。
    这一战役，前后共历时十余日，其特点是：蒋白匪军在人民解放军大军追击下，节节溃窜；我们则要求在每个战斗行动中，尽可能就地歼灭敌人，因此形成一极度紧张的追击战。时间——是这次战役的第一要素。为了争取时间，人民解放军的战士不顾风雨、日以继夜地前进，直达广州，下面是这次进军行进中一些片断的记录：
  　一　夜渡梅关
    部队自江西中部南进第十日，远望横卧在前面高耸入云的山峦，那便是有名的大庾岭了。大庾属五岭山脉，横贯粤赣两省，岭上有拔海一千二百英尺的“梅关”，是江西进入广东的交通孔道。
    在没有攀登大庾岭之前，我们就听到好多令人感动的故事：岭南人民，日夜盼望解放军，把新上场的落花生经心的炒好之后，便跑到岭上守候，看到自己军队还没有来，又赶快跑下山去，把旧花生吃了再炒出一锅新的来，准备给战士们做干粮。人民日日攀登上梅岭关向北远望，焦灼地互相询问着：“大军怎么还不来？”
    如今人民解放军终于来到大庾岭了，我们战士们的战志被人民的热情鼓舞得按捺不住。“指导员，这次非让我参加战斗不可！”机炮连文书韩荣耀，固执的这样说。前面是三连挑夫刘金中，他这时正挑着重担上山，却还纠缠着连长、指导员在议论着能上火线的条件。暮色中部队迅速地沿着崎岖的山道，蜿蜒上升，当先头部队到达那座雄踞两峰之间，北有“南粤雄关”、南有“岭南第一关”的梅岭关时，月亮已自东方徐徐升起。在月色下我们和坚持敌后斗争的两支人民武装——粤赣湘边纵、北江二支队胜利地会师了。“就是那里！”游击队司令员张华，顺着山势指点给野战军崔师长看我们第一个攻击点——南雄，然后他的队员便带领着野战军的同志们越过梅岭关，疾速地朝着那个方向前进！
    二　浈水之战
    南雄位于浈水之滨，是粤北的门户，据记载：“州雄名者，盖控带群峦，聚会百越，岭南气息仰此一州也。”很明显，要想保曲江，就必须守南雄，所以匪军不惜在有限的兵力中抽出约一师人在南雄、始兴一线布防，并且将一部主力伸至大庾岭前，企图以地堡群来控制我军南进的道路。
    了解敌情后，指挥员做了一个周密的部署：丙团迅速迂回至敌人前进工事的侧背，计划断其退路，乙团绕小道从中前进消灭城内守敌，甲团则自左翼直奔浈水，准备拦击敌自始兴北来援军。“争取打响头炮！”战士们在宣誓，把笨重的六零炮和迫击炮从驮鞍上卸下来架在肩膀上。为了按前线指挥所的命令，在黎明四点钟前完成一百三十里行程，抵达南雄城关，我们的部队沿崎岖的山道和湿滑的田径跑步前进。当乙团进至城北公路某一小村时，蒋匪守军还在睡梦中，其哨兵发觉有人时，解放军已来到他跟前。七八枪就把他们一连人打垮并擒获了。这时已是三点四十分，离城还有八里，部队又继续向前奔进，当乙团赶到南雄东关，时针正指向四点差六分。这时听到城内敌人正集结准备流窜，我一营即以炸药破毁东门把敌人打个稀烂，进占伪县政府。二营则疾步进至城南浈水大木桥边，此刻河南敌人已等不及其城中后撤部队了，忙浇了一桶煤油点火烧桥。我二营长带头六、七位战士从烟火中冲过桥去，把许多蒋匪军吓得目瞪口呆，束手就擒。我后续部队随即赶到，扑灭了桥上大火。
    当天晚上，人民的战士们又源源从这条近二百公尺长的大木桥上通过，沿浈水向始兴前进。那里，两日前国民党某团长饶纪明二十二日率领他的团队起义，当场击毙伪县长等多人撤出城外。这消息大大地鼓舞了我们的战士，兼程前进，粉碎了企图顽抗的匪军阵地，匪军慌忙向曲江方面奔命，却没有想到我们的游击队和起义部队正在前面等着他们。
    三　急取曲江
    南、始之捷，揭开了广州战役的序幕，盘踞曲江匪军受着严重的威胁，沿周田、平步一线依山构筑工事，企图阻滞我军前进。而我大军却已源源涌入广东，分路赶至前线司令部指定的地区集结。
    人民政协胜利闭幕和中央人民政府成立的消息鼓舞了整个前线，战士们在我们庄严的五星国旗前面宣誓：坚决执行朱总司令命令，用解放曲江、解放广州来庆祝开国大曲，向毛主席献礼！紧张地完成了一切战斗准备工作。
    十月六日正是古历中秋节，我军开始进攻曲江。
    为了避免惊动曲江外围之敌，求得歼灭其有生力量，然后攻取曲江城。我们一支轻装部队，头天黄昏就插进始兴西南部的大山中，在悬崖绝壁从来没有人到过的地方行进。夜间我们的指挥员、战斗员们就倒背着枪以便去探索道路，用竹梯架在陡峭的地方上下，用臂部代替脚在茅草丛生的山岭上滑行着，我们正面部队则以每小时二十五里的行速抢到前面去袭击闻风而逃的敌人，一边打仗，一边前进。路上电话员不时把电线接在长途电线上向大家报告消息。现在曲江匪军已陷入极端慌乱的状态中，一个匪军在电话里惊慌叫着：“来啦！来啦！”便哑然无声了。匪军逃窜时除了两道桥外，其余十几座大小桥梁，甚至放上炸药也来不及爆炸便逃散了。当我军七日清晨进抵曲江城东河坝时，匪军六十三军最后撤走部队，以汽油燃着韶关大桥，向西南逃窜，我先头部队即飞奔上前扑灭火焰，抢救了桥梁，胜利进占曲江城。
    这天夜里，雨水拍打着北江，在师的临时指挥所作战地前面，秦军长、谷政委传达着前线司令部作战的命令：“敌人弃守曲江南逃，我们必须立即改攻坚为追击，敌人逃到那里，我们追到那里，扭住一股，歼灭一股，兼程向广州前进！”进军号响了，战士们从休息的地方跳起来，扛上枪炮，冒雨跨行在滑湿的铁枕道木上连夜前进。
