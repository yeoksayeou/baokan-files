The Wage System of "To Each According to His Work"
—Dalian Correspondence, Part Five
By Our Correspondent Tian Liu

I. The Seven-Grade Wage System

At the Dalian Industrial Exhibition, numerous production charts indicate that this year, all public factories in the Lüda area have experienced a leap in production. The production records are marked, rising steadily towards the upper right.

A rational "to each according to his work" wage system—the seven-grade wage system—is one of the key factors enabling this leap in production. This wage system was learned from the Soviet Union. Its characteristic is that workers can maintain their livelihood during times of production difficulties; as production develops, the lives of workers improve accordingly. It differs from the multi-grade (in reality, no-grade) egalitarian wage system that has lost the meaning of grades, and it also differs from the wage system that is detached from production development and stipulates wages based on "enough to support one to one and a half people." It is formulated based on the principle of "to each according to his work." Because its grades are simple and clear, and calculation is convenient, workers can easily understand and master it; because its grade differences are large and progressive, it can constantly maintain the workers' full production enthusiasm, encourage workers to improve, and directly promote the rapid advancement of the productive forces of Lüda.

This rational seven-grade wage system, it is said, in the Soviet Union, also underwent many changes, accumulating thirty years of industrial construction experience and constantly overcoming the problems of egalitarianism before it became the current seven-grade wage system. The Soviet Union attaches great importance to wage grades and progression rates—it not only marks the difference in workers' skills, but also contains the important role of cultivating cadres and fostering talents. Therefore, in the Soviet Union, wage grades and progression rates are uniformly formulated by the state, and no one can change them. As for wage standards, each region can formulate them according to local living standards. For example, the first-grade worker wage standard of Sino-Soviet enterprises in the Lüda area is 2,400 yuan (Kwantung currency, same below), which was determined based on the Dalian social cost of living index at the end of 1946, and is just enough to support the worker himself. The progression rates for grades two, three, and above are in accordance with the Soviet national regulations—that is, in accordance with the labor value created by different workers. (See Table 1)

Worker Grade 	I 	II 	III 	IV 	V 	VI 	VII
Progression Rate (as a percentage of Grade I wage) 	100 	120 	145 	175 	215 	260 	320

It can be seen from this table that the wage difference between each grade is determined by the difficulty of mastering the technology and the progressive rate. The higher the grade, the greater the progression, which can stimulate workers to continuously improve their skills, improve production, and enhance their motivation. Soviet comrades often say: "If you only earn 50 yuan more than me, why should I be eager to catch up with your grade?"

In Lüda, staff and workers are strictly distinguished (not politically). All those engaged in production are workers. The rest are staff—from factory directors to general workers, from engineers to doctors, all included. The work is complex and diverse, and therefore requires people with various abilities, skills, and knowledge to engage in different work. Therefore, the staff wage grades are far more numerous than those of workers, and the progression rate is not as large as that of workers' wages. (See Table 2)

Grade 	First-Class Enterprise 	Second-Class Enterprise
I 	3,500 	3,200
II 	4,500 	4,000
III 	5,500 	5,000
IV 	6,500 	5,800
V 	7,500 	6,500
VI 	8,500 	7,700
VII 	9,000 	8,200
VIII 	10,000 	9,000
IX 	11,000 	10,000
X 	12,000 	11,000
XI 	13,000 	12,000
XII 	14,000 	12,500
XIII 	15,000 	13,500
XIV 	16,000 	14,500
XV 	17,000 	15,000

(Note: First-class enterprises are heavy industry, and second-class enterprises are light industry. The first-grade worker wage of a first-class enterprise is 2,400 yuan (as in Table 1), and the first-grade wage of a second-class enterprise is 2,000 yuan. The progression rate is the same. In addition, workers in industries harmful to health receive an additional 15% of their original salary.)

Lüda now adopts the form of "combining currency and rations" to pay wages. Before last year, all public enterprises except Sino-Soviet joint ventures used grain wages. Later, due to changes in grain prices (a 30% drop after currency reform last winter), workers were greatly affected, so this spring they also switched to the "currency and rations" wage form. The advantages of this wage form are: ① It can guarantee the lives of workers. ② It will not stimulate price fluctuations due to wage payments. ③ It can be used to ration—that is, sell—the products of the enterprise itself or other public enterprises to the workers. Workers avoid intermediate exploitation and obtain inexpensive daily necessities, and the enterprise authorities also solve a part of the sales problem, accelerating capital turnover, which is beneficial to both parties.

Rations are mainly the staple food of grain. With the development of production, the scope and quantity of rations can be gradually expanded. Lüda allocates rations to employees according to their wage grade, not an egalitarian one share per person. Ration allocation to workers' families is limited to dependent lineal relatives, and the amount is half or even less than that of the worker himself. Rations are divided into two types: special rations and ordinary rations. Special rations are given to key production leaders such as factory directors, engineers, and skilled workers; ordinary rations are given to general workers. Those who have made special contributions to production also receive temporary rations. For example, Wang Xiqing, a technician at the Electrical Testing Institute, because of his important contributions, now receives, in addition to his regular salary, a special ration of 16 jin of rice, 30 jin of white flour, and 16 jin of meat per month, and lives in a beautiful Western-style house.

Closely related to wages are the reward and punishment system and the holiday system... When examining the wage issue, it is necessary to include these in the calculation in order to measure the real living conditions of the liberated Chinese working class. The collective contracts signed by the trade unions and factory management in Sino-Soviet joint ventures and public enterprises stipulate that if the production target is exceeded, the factory will issue bonuses in accordance with the regulations, and the wage rate for extra work hours is 50% higher than the regular salary. Child laborers and those working at night have their working hours shortened by one hour compared to day workers. Women workers receive equal pay for equal work, and pregnant women have two and a half months of maternity leave with full pay. Workers who take sick leave retain their position and full salary within three months. Each month, the factory contributes an amount equivalent to 5% of the total wages as employee social insurance funds. There is one day off per week, and six days of statutory holidays throughout the year. Those who have worked in the enterprise for more than eleven months have twelve days of annual leave, and then three days of annual leave are added each year up to a maximum of twenty-four days, etc. These can be said to be worker welfare undertakings, or a more complete wage system. The collective contract also stipulates that if a worker fails to complete the task or produces defective products due to his own fault, he will receive wages according to the quantity completed, and no wages will be paid for defective products; if work is stopped for reasons not attributable to the worker (such as temporary shortage of raw materials, power outage, etc.), the wage will be paid at half the rate. This is because when the factory and the state suffer losses, the working class, as the master of the enterprise and the state, should naturally share the loss.

II. Progressive Wage System for Over-Quota Production

After the implementation of the seven-grade wage system, the following changes will inevitably occur: the enthusiasm of workers will be greatly improved, and the phenomenon of exceeding production tasks often occurs. At this time, if there is no more complete wage system to consolidate and further promote this gratifying production surge, it will often stagnate at the level already achieved. In order to break through this level and make production move forward, it is necessary to implement the "progressive wage system for over-quota production." It is the development of the seven-grade wage system and a more complete seven-grade wage system. This wage system stipulates that when workers exceed the completion of production tasks, they will be given a certain progressive wage reward according to the degree of exceeding the quota. For example, if the task is exceeded by 5%, the basic worker will receive 110% of his original wage, and the auxiliary worker will receive 105% of his original wage. When the task is exceeded by 75%, the basic worker will receive double the wage, and the auxiliary worker can receive 170% of his original wage (the division of basic workers and auxiliary workers is determined according to the nature of the factory and the role played in the product manufacturing process. For example, lathe workers in machine factories are basic workers, but in spinning mills, these workers are auxiliary workers). This wage system also applies to staff, including factory directors, because the surge in production requires strong organizational leadership and production command, and technical training and guidance are very important; otherwise, production will be limited to the workers' level. When the factory's overall production task is exceeded by 40% or less, the staff will be paid according to the progressive bonus rate of basic workers. When the production task is exceeded by more than 40%, the bonus will be 70% of the original salary (this is the highest amount). According to scientific calculations, as long as the workers' awareness is improved, the work attitude is correct, and 80% of the workers give full play to their enthusiasm, it is easy to achieve a 40% over-quota. To exceed 40% or more requires significant technical and mechanical improvements, which increases the responsibility of technical workers and production commanders. The bonus for exceeding the quota is divided into two types according to the nature of production: individual and collective. Individual bonus can be implemented for those who can implement individual bonus, such as spinning workers and weaving workers in yarn factories. However, due to the fact that the sand-turning workers in the machinery factory cannot be calculated according to individuals, it is better to implement a collective bonus. Auxiliary workers receive their due over-quota wages according to the over-quota average of the department they assist. This wage system can promote rapid production development and increase workers' income, which is in line with Chairman Mao's principle of "developing production and benefiting both public and private." The Dalian Glass Factory completed its annual plan in the first half of this year, thereby reducing costs by 34%. Due to the reduction of working hours and the saving of a large number of labor force, the factory has now begun its production plan for next year, which is the greatest victory. The income of workers has increased by an average of 40% in the first half of this year. In the past, some cadres expressed doubts about the progressive bonus wage system of the seven-grade system, believing that wages were too low to support families when production was difficult, and wages were too high after production developed. In fact, as long as the wage grade and standard are set correctly, the production plan is appropriately formulated, and the proportion of wages in the cost is appropriate, there is nothing to worry about. We should not be afraid of workers' income increasing. The higher the wage, the more developed the production, and the more the wealth of the country and the people increases. At the same time, when workers are sure that their increased income is due to greater contributions to the country, their sense of ownership will be greatly strengthened, and their production enthusiasm will be further improved.

    按劳取酬的工资制度
    ——大连通讯之五
    本报记者  田流
    一、七级工资制
    大连工业展览会中，众多的生产图表指明，今年旅大地区各公营工厂，都有一个生产上的飞跃发展。那标志着生产纪录，向右上方一直升起。
    合理的按劳取酬的工资制度——七级工资制，是使生产飞跃发展的重要因素之一。这种工资制度是向苏联学来的。它的特点是在生产困难时期，工人可以维持生活；生产发展起来，工人生活即随之改善。它和失去了等级意义的多等级——实际上是无等级的平均主义的工资制不同，也和“养活一口人到一口半人”的脱离开生产发展而规定的工资制度不同。它是根据按劳取酬的原则制订的。因为它等级简单明了，计算方便，工人容易了解掌握；因为它等级距离大又是累进的，所以便能经常保持着工人饱满的生产热情，鼓舞着工人上进，直接促进了旅大工业生产力的迅速前进。
    这种合理的按劳取酬的七级工资制，据说在苏联也是经过多次变动，积三十年建设工业的经验和不断克服平均主义的毛病之后，才成为现在的七级工资制的。苏联对工资等级和累进率是非常重视的——它不仅标志着工人技术的差别，更含有培养干部造就人才的重大作用。因此，在苏联，工资等级和累进率统一由国家制定，任何人不能更改。至于工资标准，各地可根据当地生活水平拟定。譬如旅大地区中苏企业的第一级工人工资标准是二、四○○元（关东币，下同）就是根据一九四六年底大连市社会生活指数订出的，正好能养活工人自己。以上之二级、三级……工资累进率是按照苏联国家规定的——也就是按照不同工人创造的劳动价值规定的。（如表一）
  工人级别        一    二    三     四     五     六     七累进率（以一级工资为100 %）    100    120   145    175    215  
  260    320
    从这个表上可以看出，各级间的工资差额，是按着技术掌握的难易而规定累进率的，等级越高累进越大，这就能够刺激工人不断的提高技术、改进生产，增强上进心。苏联同志常说：“如果你只比我多五○元，我为什么一定要赶上你的等级呢？”
    在旅大，职员和工人是严格区别开来的（不是政治上）凡从事于生产的为工人。其余都是职员——从厂长到杂役，从工程师到医生统统包括在内。工作复杂多样，因此也需要各种各样能力、技术、知识的人从事各种不同的工作，所以职员工资等级远较工人为多，累进率则不如工人工资大。（见表二）等级                一级企业                二级企业一                ３，５００                ３，２００二                ４，５００                ４，０００三                ５，５００                ５，０００四                ６，５００                ５，８００五                ７，５００                ６，５００六                ８，５００                ７，７００七                ９，０００                ８，２００八              １０，０００                ９，０００九              １１，０００              １０，０００十              １２，０００              １１，０００十一            １３，０００              １２，０００十二            １４，０００              １２，５００十三            １５，０００              １３，５００十四            １６，０００              １４，５００十五            １７，０００              １５，０００
    （注：一级企业是重工业，二级企业是轻工业。一级企业一级工人工资是二·四○○元（如表一），二级企业一级工资是二·○○○元，累进率同，另对有害健康工业的工人工资，按原薪加百分之十五）
    旅大现在采用“货币与配给结合”的形式发放工资。在去年以前，除中苏企业外，所有公营企业都是粮食工资，后来因粮价变动（去冬币改后下降百分之三○），工人受影响很大，今年春也改行“货币与配给结合”的工资形式了。这种工资形式的好处是：①能保障工人生活。②不致因发工资刺激物价波动。③能借此将本企业或其他公营企业的产品配给——也就是推销给工人，工人避免了中间剥削，得到了价格低廉的日用必需品，企业当局也解决了一部销路问题，加速了资金流转，对双方都有利。
    配给品主要是生活必需品的粮食。随着生产的发展，也可逐渐扩大配给品的范围和数量。旅大对职工按照工资等级来配给，不是平均主义的每人发一份。工人家属配给只限于没有劳动力的直系亲属，数量是本人之半或者还要少些。配给分特殊配给与普通配给两种。特配是给主要的生产领导者如厂长、工程师、技术工人等；普通配给是给一般工人的。对于生产有特殊功勋者还有临时配给，如电气试验所王锡卿技师，因他有重要贡献，现在除领本俸外，每月还有特配的十六斤大米，三十斤白面和十六斤肉，并让他住上了漂亮的洋房。
    和工资有密切关系的还有奖惩制度及假日制度……，考查工资问题时，一定要把这些计算在内，才能衡量解放了的中国工人阶级的真实生活情况。中苏合营企业及公营企业中职工会和厂方签订的集体合同上规定：超过生产任务者，厂方要按照规定发给奖金，加工时间的工资额比本俸要高百分之五十，童工及夜间工作者比日工缩短一小时。女工同工同酬，产妇有两个半月休假，工资照发。因病请假者三个月内厂方保留其职位和本俸。每月厂方拿出相当工资百分之五的金额，为职工社会保险金。每周有一天休假日，全年有六天例假节日，在本企业工作满十一个月者每年有十二天休假日，以后每年增加三天休假日直至二十四天的最高额等等，这些可以说是工人福利事业，也可以说是更完备的工资制度。集体合同里也规定着，工人因自己过失没有完成任务或产生废品，按完成的数量领工资，废品则不发工资；非因工人过失（如一时原料供应不上、停电等）而停工时，工资按半数发给。这是因为当工厂和国家受到损失时，作为企业和国家主人的工人阶级，自应分担这个损失。
    二、超额累进工资制
    七级工资制实行后，必然会引起这样的变化：工人积极性大大提高，常常出现超过生产任务的现象，这时如果没有更完善的工资制度，来巩固和更加促进这种可喜的生产高涨，常常会使它滞留在既得水平上。为着突破这种水平使生产更向前进，就必须实行“超额累进工资制”，它是七级工资制的发展，是更加完善的一种七级工资制度。这种工资制度规定：工人超过完成生产任务时，按照超过的程度给予一定的累进的工资报酬。如超过任务百分之五，基本工人得其原工资的百分之一一○，辅助工人得其原工资的百分之一○五，超过任务百分之七五时，基本工人便得到双倍的工资，辅助工人可得原工资的百分之一七○（基本工人与辅助工人之划分，根据该工厂性质和产品制造过程中所起作用而定，如机器工厂的车床工人是基本工人，但在纺纱厂里，这些工人就是辅助工人了。）这种工资制同样适用于职员直至厂长，因为生产的高涨非常需要坚强的组织领导和生产指挥，十分需要技术的培养和指导，不然就会使生产限制在工人水平上。在全厂生产任务超过百分之四○以下时，职员按基本工人的累奖率发薪，超过百分之四○以上时，则奖原薪百分之七○（此为最高额）。根据科学的计算只要工人觉悟提高，劳动态度正确，有百分之八○的工人发挥了积极性，就容易作到百分之四○的超额；而要超过百分之四○以上，就需有技术上和机械上的重要改进才行，这就加重了技术工作者和生产指挥者的责任了。超奖视生产性质分为个人与集体两种，能实行个人超奖的就实行个人超奖，如纱厂纺纱工人、织布工人等，但机械厂的翻砂工人，因其不能按照个人计算，就以实行集体奖为好，辅助工人按照他辅助的部门超额平均数获得他应得的超额工资。这种工资制度，能促进生产迅速发展和增加工人收入，是符合毛主席“发展生产、公私两利”原则的。大连玻璃工厂今年前半年完成了全年计划，因此减低成本达百分之三十四，由于缩短了工时，节省了大批劳动力，现在该厂已开始了明年的生产计划，这是最大的胜利。工人的收入在今年前半年平均提高了百分之四十。在过去部分干部曾对七级制的超奖工资制表示怀疑，认为生产困难时，工资太低不能养家活口，生产发展起来后，工资又太高了。其实只要工资等级及标准定得正确，生产计划订的恰当，工资在成本中占的比重合适了，一切都是不足虑的。不该害怕工人收入增加。工资越高表示生产越发展，国家和人民的财富越增加；同时，当着工人们确切知道了他的收入增加是由于对国家有了更大的贡献，他的主人翁思想就会大大加强，生产热情就能更进一步提高了。
