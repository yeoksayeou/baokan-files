【Beijing News】The second session of the Beijing Municipal People's Representatives Conference victoriously concluded yesterday (22nd). After commencing at 9:00 AM, the conference continued with fervent discussions on the five financial and tax revenue proposals put forth by the Municipal Government, as well as the proposals submitted by the First Session of the People's Representatives Conference Consultative Committee regarding the establishment of evening schools and the relief of unemployed workers. The representatives unanimously endorsed the five financial and tax revenue proposals submitted by the Municipal Government, guaranteeing that they would widely publicize them among the citizens after the meeting, assist the government in completing tax collection on schedule, and offer suggestions on specific implementation methods (summaries of speeches are reported separately). Deputy Mayor Zhang spoke on behalf of the Municipal Government, expressing acceptance. Subsequently, all representatives unanimously raised their hands to pass each proposal. During the discussion of the proposal to establish evening supplementary schools, Weng Dujian explained that this was to meet the learning needs of workers and cadres, and to improve the cultural level and work skills of workers and staff. Xiao Ming explained that the proposal regarding the relief of unemployed workers was intended to ensure the livelihoods of some employees laid off by public and private factories and workshops. Following deliberation by the conference, both proposals were unanimously passed.

The conference then proceeded to discuss the "Provisional Organizational Outline of the Beijing Municipal People's Government," "Election Methods for the Beijing Municipal People's Government Committee," and the list of candidates for Mayor, Deputy Mayors, and members of the Municipal Government Committee, all of which had been prepared by the First Session of the People's Representatives Conference Consultative Committee and approved by the Presidium of the Conference. During the discussion, all representatives deliberated each item and clause, and separate votes were held. After unanimous approval from the floor, a secret ballot was used to conduct the election in a serious and conscientious manner. After voting was completed, during the break, Luo Ruiqing, Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, reported on the implementation of the conference's resolution to close brothels (summary of the report is reported separately). After the report, Peng Zhen, Executive Chairman of the conference, added, "From now on, the feudal remnant of the brothel system in Beijing has been completely eliminated. After the tireless work of staff from the Public Security Bureau, Civil Affairs Bureau, and the Municipal Women's Federation, the brothels have been completely closed. We should commend their work and thank them. When we eliminate an evil system, we are bound to encounter resistance from some old forces. We must crush their resistance and overcome all difficulties in our work. The main task after closing the brothels is to transform the thinking of the prostitutes and settle their lives. The people of Beijing are ready to devote their efforts to solving the problem of the prostitutes."

The conference adjourned for one hour and resumed at 3:00 PM to announce the results of the election of the Mayor, Deputy Mayors, and members of the Municipal Government Committee. When Yu Xinqing, Executive Chairman of the conference, announced the election of Mayor Nie Rongzhen and others, the entire hall erupted in enthusiastic applause and cheers. The Beijing Young Pioneers presented flowers to Mayor Nie, Deputy Mayor Zhang, and the members of the Municipal Government Committee to pay their respects. Following this, the conference discussed the representatives' proposals. The conference received a total of one hundred and sixteen proposals, which were reviewed and merged into ninety-seven by the Proposals Review Committee, and handled in three categories: 1. Eleven proposals were submitted to the conference for discussion. 2. Eighty-two proposals were sent to the government for reference and handling. 3. Four proposals were postponed, retained, rejected, or deemed unsuitable for handling by the government. Ninety-three proposals were discussed and passed. The conference representatives attached great importance to proposals such as issuing public bonds to stabilize prices, considering the issuance of public bonds an important measure for stabilizing prices and carrying out municipal construction, and suggested that it be submitted to the Central People's Government for adoption and implementation.

Next, the list of candidates for Chairman, Vice-Chairman, and members of the Consultative Committee of this session of the Representatives Conference was discussed and an election was held (the list of those elected is reported separately). Subsequently, the "Resolution on the Work Report of the Municipal Government" was discussed and passed (the full text of the resolution is reported separately), along with a congratulatory telegram to Chairman Mao of the Central People's Government, a congratulatory telegram to Commander-in-Chief Zhu De of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and all commanders and fighters of the field armies, and the conference's declaration. Then, Pan Linggao, an 83-year-old elder statesman, delivered the closing remarks on behalf of the conference (the full text of the closing remarks is reported separately). Finally, Peng Zhen, Executive Chairman of the conference, declared the successful conclusion of the conference, saying: "This session of the conference has accomplished a historic event in the people's capital, electing the Mayor, Deputy Mayors, and the Municipal Government Committee, fulfilling the task assigned to us by Chairman Mao three months ago. All of us representatives must strive to realize the resolutions of the conference in the future." (Photo attached)
