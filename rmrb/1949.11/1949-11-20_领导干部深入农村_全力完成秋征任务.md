Leading Cadres Go Deep into Rural Areas
　　Fully Completing the Autumn Grain Collection Task
    October was the month for autumn grain collection for all the rural areas in Hunan Province. Changsha, Changde, and Yiyang Special Districts are the key areas for the province's autumn grain collection work. In order to concentrate efforts on the autumn grain collection work, all party and government organs below the provincial level, except for a small number of necessary staff, went to work in the countryside. Leading cadres at all levels went deep into the rural areas to provide personal guidance. A large number of students from local revolutionary cadre schools and county training classes also went to the countryside to assist. As of the end of October, the grain collection work in the three key areas has entered the stage of mass evaluation. In Changsha Special District, where work started earlier, the final evaluation work has generally been completed, and in some areas, the masses have begun to deliver grain. During this stage, farmer representative meetings were generally held at the county and district levels to publicize the policy of reasonable burden, initially enlighten the farmers' class consciousness, and reflect the true situation in rural areas. Various places mobilized the broad masses through the representatives to supervise the old Bao-Jia personnel and carry out a certain degree of reasonable burden struggle against landlords and local bullies. Therefore, when implementing democratic evaluation and reasonable burden, many places widely carried out the struggle to squeeze out undeclared land, found that landlords and local tyrants had concealed a large amount of land, and exposed their conspiracy to shift the burden. At the same time, many places also combined the work of clearing out scattered bandits, establishing local armed forces, and reorganizing guerrilla troops to eliminate obstacles to the autumn grain collection work. However, during this stage, some deviations were also found in individual places. Some places, failing to recognize that relying on and mobilizing the masses combined with appropriate administrative orders is the basic key to implementing the reasonable burden policy and completing the autumn grain collection, simply emphasized the rapid completion of tasks and adopted coercive measures, thus affecting the work. Some places neglected the use of old Bao-Jia personnel or adopted an excessively left-leaning policy towards them indiscriminately; conversely, some places relied solely on the old Bao-Jia heads without mobilizing the masses to supervise them, resulting in many malpractices. Some places only squeezed out undeclared land in isolation, without combining it with the evaluation of the burden, so that the masses were indifferent, and not only could they not squeeze out undeclared land, but also public grain could not be collected well. There were also places that treated middle and poor peasants the same as landlords and rich peasants, universally implementing squeezing out undeclared land, which not only diverted the target of attack, but also isolated themselves, making the work of mobilizing the masses more difficult. In terms of working methods, some places focused on gaining experience in certain key areas while neglecting to promote it to a wider area, and the points and the surface were not well combined. These shortcomings are now being vigorously overcome.

　　领导干部深入农村
  　全力完成秋征任务
    十月份湖南全省农村的工作中心是秋征。长沙、常德、益阳等三个专区是全省秋征工作的重点。为了集中力量进行秋征工作，省级以下各级党政机关除留少数必要工作人员外，全部下乡工作。各级领导干部都普遍深入农村，亲自指导。各地革命干部学校和各县训练班的大批学员，亦下乡协助。至十月底止，三个重点区的征粮工作，已进入群众评议阶段。工作开始较早的长沙专区，一般已完成最后评议工作，部分地区群众已开始送粮。在这一阶段中，各地普遍地召开了县及区的农民代表会议，宣传了合理负担政策，初步启发了农民的阶级觉悟，反映了农村的真实情况。各地通过代表们发动了广大群众，监督旧保甲人员，并对地主恶霸分子进行一定程度的合理负担斗争。因而在实行民主评议及合理负担时，许多地方都广泛地进行了挤黑地斗争，查出地主土豪大量瞒田，揭穿他们转嫁负担的阴谋。同时，许多地方并结合了清剿散匪、建立地方武装、整编游杂部队等工作，扫除了秋征工作的阻碍。但这一阶段中，在个别地方也发现了一些偏向，有的地方由于没有认识到依靠和发动群众与行政命令适当结合是贯彻合理负担政策和完成秋征的基本关键，只是片面地强调迅速完成任务，单纯采用强迫命令的办法，因此使工作受到影响。有的地方忽视使用旧保甲人员或对他们不加分别的采取过左的政策；相反的，也有些地方单纯依靠旧保甲长，没有发动群众去监督他们，以致发生许多弊病。有些地方只孤立地去挤黑地，没有和评议负担工作结合起来，致群众漠不关心，不但挤不出黑地，公粮也不能很好征收。还有的地方把中贫农和地主富农同样看待，普遍地实行挤黑地，不但分散了打击目标，而且使自己陷于孤立，使发动群众的工作增加了不少困难。在工作方法上，有些地方着重在某些重点地区取得经验，而忽略了推广至广大地区，点和面没有很好的结合。这些缺点，现正大力克服中。
