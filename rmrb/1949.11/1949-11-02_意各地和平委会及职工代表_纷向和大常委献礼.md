Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 31st: According to a TASS dispatch from Rome: A mass rally was held here on the 30th to celebrate the Second Plenary Session of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress. Thousands of workers, staff, and intellectuals from Rome attended the conference. World Peace Council Standing Committee members Vittorio, Fadeyev, Ehrenburg, Nenni, Picasso, Bernal, Spurna, and Sereni, as well as Soviet Ambassador to Italy Kostylev and diplomatic representatives from various People's Democratic countries, attended the conference held at the Teatro Adriano in Rome.

　　World Peace Council Vice-Chairman and South African people's spokesperson Dapasie delivered a speech stating that the current plenary session of the World Peace Council Standing Committee summarized the events and the struggles and activities of peace advocates since the World Peace Congress. Facts have proven that the World Peace Council Standing Committee, established six months ago, has become the headquarters of peace forces, and the forces commanded by this headquarters are more numerous and powerful than those commanded by certain other headquarters. Dapasie's remarks were met with loud cheers from the crowd. Ehrenburg, who was warmly welcomed, declared that dark storm clouds were shrouding the Italian sky. However, peace advocates around the world are convinced that the Italian people will be able to dispel these clouds and become masters of their own country. Ehrenburg received particularly warm applause when he spoke of the friendship linking the Soviet and Italian people. Delegations from peace committees in Rome, Venice, Milan, Palermo, Bologna, Genoa, and other Italian cities, as well as representatives from trade union organizations and factory workers, presented many gifts to the members of the Standing Committee. Finally, the film "The Battle for Survival," about the World Peace Congresses in Paris and Prague, was screened at the meeting.
