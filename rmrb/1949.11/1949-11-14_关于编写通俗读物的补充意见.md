    Supplementary Opinions on Writing Popular Readings
    Hong
    After reading Comrade Yang Lie's "How to Write Popular Readings," I would like to offer some experiences from my work as a supplement.
    Before writing, it is necessary to first investigate the content of popular readings, and determine this based on current tasks and the needs of the times, etc. That is one aspect. The masses' ideological state on this issue is another aspect of determining the content, and it is an important one. These two must be combined in order for the theory to be mastered by the masses. Therefore, after the theme is roughly determined, it is necessary to talk to some people in the masses about the issues to be written, in order to understand their views on the issue, where their ideological obstacles lie, and what positive factors in their minds can be utilized. At the same time, you can also talk to them about the general content you are preparing to write, to see what they are not easy to accept and what is easiest to accept. In addition, if you can find people who did not understand this issue before but now understand it to talk to and ask for their advice, you will gain even more. Once, I was preparing to write a reader for liberated soldiers. I first talked to some newly liberated soldiers to understand their initial ideological state, and then I talked to liberated soldiers who had been reformed for a short time. They told me more profoundly their psychology when they were first liberated and actively suggested how to write. For example, they said that it should start with the question of "how did you become soldiers," which can most touch the psychological pain of the liberated soldiers. This is the principle of "from the masses, to the masses" and "first be a student of the masses, and then be a teacher of the masses."
    When writing, always try to figure out the reader's psychology, as if debating with the other party. Estimate what questions the other party will have, what opposing ideas they will have, and then arrange how to defeat them. Education is an ideological struggle, and readings should be written as weapons.
    It is necessary to be graphic and use the masses' own existing knowledge to explain the problems they do not know. Sensory knowledge often leaves the deepest impression. Broad principles (concepts) should preferably be explained with graphic things (concrete). For example, if we say that the four major families cruelly plundered the wealth of the Chinese people, perhaps the reader's impression is not very deep. If we say that the property plundered by the four major families is one or two million US dollars, which is how much money each Chinese person has been extorted (converting US dollars into money that everyone is familiar with), or if the property of the four major families is turned into banknotes, it can be laid from where to where, if piled up, how high it can be, if a person counts in the bank, how many years it will take, etc. In this way, the reader will feel thrilling and have a deep impression.

    关于编写通俗读物的补充意见
    弘
    读了杨烈同志“怎样编写通俗读物”，愿提出几点工作中的体会，作为补充。
    编写前必须先要调查研究通俗读物的内容，根据当前任务和时事需要等等来确定这是一个方面。而群众对这个问题的思想状况又是确定内容的另一方面，而且是重要的一面。这两者必需结合，才能使理论为群众所掌握。因此在主题大体确定后，就要把所要写的问题，在群众中找些人谈谈，以了解他们对这个问题的看法，思想障碍在那里，他们心中有些什么积极因素可以利用。同时还可以把自己准备写的大体内容和他们谈谈，看那些他们不易接受，那些最易接受。此外，如能找到对这个问题原先不了解而现在刚了解的人谈，向他们求教，得益还会更大。有一次我准备写一本解放战士的读物，先找了些新解放战士谈，了解了初步思想状况，以后又找了经过改造不久的解放战士谈，他们更深刻地告诉我他们刚解放时的心理，并且积极建议应该怎样写，比如他们说应该从“你们怎样出来当兵的”这个问题提起，最能触到解放战士们心理的痛处。这就是“从群众中来，到群众中去”“先做群众的学生，然后才做群众的先生”的道理。
    写的时候要时时刻刻揣摩读者心理，好象和对方辩论一样。估计对方会发生那些疑问，有那些对立思想，然后安排如何将其击破。教育就是一个思想斗争，读物就是要作为武器来写的。
    要形象化，要以群众自己已有的知识来说明他们所未知的问题。感性知识给人印象往往是最深的。大道理（概念）最好要以形象的东西（具体）来说明。比如我们说四大家族残酷地掠夺了中国人民的财富，也许读者印象还不怎样深刻，如果说四大家族掠夺来的财产有一二百万万美元，合每一个中国人头上被他括去多少钱（把美元合成大家熟悉的钱），或是说，如四大家族的财产变成票子，可以从什么地方铺到什么地方，如果堆起来，可以有多高，如果一个人在银行里数，要数多少年等等。这样读者就会觉得惊心动魄，印象就深刻了。
