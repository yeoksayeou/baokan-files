Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng, 7th: In order to restore and develop Henan's special silk products, the Henan Provincial People's Government's Department of Agriculture and the People's Bank of China Henan Branch recently allocated 100 million RMB in silkworm seed loans and assisted silkworm farmers in improving silkworm breeds. The Nanyang Administrative Office also issued 50 million RMB in silkworm seed loans. Henan is one of the famous silk-producing areas in the country, divided into three major silk regions: Shangqiu and Zhecheng districts in eastern Henan, Huangchuan and Guangshan districts in southern Henan, and Wan (Nanyang)nan district in western Henan. The tussah silk in western Henan is of excellent quality, and together with Jiaodong and Liaodong, it is known as China's three major tussah silk producing areas. According to statistics from the western Henan region, at the peak of silk production, there were approximately 100,000 silkworm farming households, with about one million people depending on it for their livelihood. Before liberation, due to the destruction by the Kuomintang bandit gangs, the monopoly of silk exports, and the heavy exploitation by feudal landlords, silkworm farmers became increasingly bankrupt. After the liberation of Henan, local people's governments actively supported silkworm farmers in restoring production. Since the beginning of summer this year, the Henan Provincial Government's Department of Agriculture has restored the Liziqingdian Tussah Silkworm Experimental Farm in Nanzhao and organized experienced veteran silkworm farmers to guide silkworm breeding in various places. Recently, the Department of Agriculture, together with silkworm farmer representatives, organized a seed purchase group, which went to Northeast China in late last month to purchase superior silkworm seeds in order to carry out large-scale silk production next year.

　　河南发放蚕种贷款
  　恢复蚕丝生产
    组织购种小组赴东北采购优良蚕种
    【新华社开封七日电】河南省人民政府农业厅和人民银行河南省分行，为恢复和发展河南蚕丝特产，最近特拨发蚕种贷款人民币一亿元，并帮助蚕户进行改良蚕种工作。南阳专署也发出蚕种贷款五千万元。河南为全国著名蚕丝产区之一，全省分豫东的商邱、柘城区，豫南的潢川、光山区和豫西的宛（南阳）南区等三大蚕区。豫西的柞蚕丝质量甚佳，与胶东、辽东合称为我国三大柞蚕产区。据豫西地区统计：丝产最盛时，养蚕户达十万户左右，约有百余万人依此为生。解放前，因国民党匪帮的摧残及垄断蚕丝出口和封建地主的重重剥削，蚕农日趋破产。河南解放后，各地人民政府即积极扶助蚕户恢复生产。今年入夏以来，河南省政府农业厅恢复了南召李青店柞蚕试验场，并组织有经验的老蚕农指导各地饲蚕。最近农业厅又与蚕民代表等组织了购种小组，于上月下旬赴东北采购优良蚕种，以便明年大规模开展蚕丝生产。
