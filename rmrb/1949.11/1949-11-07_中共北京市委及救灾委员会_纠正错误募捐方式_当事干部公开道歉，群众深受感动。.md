　　The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Disaster Relief Committee
  　Correct Erroneous Fundraising Methods
    Responsible Cadres Publicly Apologize, Deeply Moving the Masses.
    [Beijing News] The Beijing Municipal All-Circles Disaster Relief Committee recently inspected and corrected the Eighth District Branch for its fundraising methods that violated the principle of voluntarism by using coercive orders, which has won the support and praise of the broad masses.
    When conducting fundraising, individual cadres of the Eighth District Branch violated the principle of voluntarism. They told merchants on Qianmen Street who donated less money, "With such a large business, you're donating so little; you might as well not donate!" They even repeatedly called merchants who donated less for individual talks, and finally said, "Go back and think about it carefully!" This fundraising method, which resembled coercive orders, aroused dissatisfaction among the merchants and the masses. After citizen Zhang Zedong reported the situation to Peng Zhen of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in an anonymous letter, Peng Zhen immediately forwarded the report to the Beijing All-Circles Disaster Relief Committee. The committee attached great importance to this matter and immediately (October 30th) sent Commissioner Liu Ren to the Eighth District Branch for inspection. It was confirmed that such facts existed. Cadres were immediately summoned for criticism and self-criticism. The responsible cadres personally went to the merchants who had been forced to donate to apologize and admit their mistakes. On the 31st, the Eighth District Branch convened a meeting of more than 40 stores outside Qianmen, where they admitted the error in the fundraising method and announced the cancellation of the previously coerced donation amounts, allowing the stores to voluntarily donate again. At the government affairs meeting held by the Municipal Government on November 2nd, a decision was made to promptly inspect and correct this matter. This measure immediately moved and won the support of the broad masses. Hengshengyu, Tongyiyong, and other stores on Qianmen Street voluntarily increased their donation of rice by 100 jin or 50 jin. Zhang Zedong, a shop assistant at Zhengxing Tea Shop who wrote the anonymous letter, wrote a letter to Peng Zhen of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party under his real name to express his gratitude. The original letter stated: "Our leader, Comrade Peng Zhen: The letter I wrote to you last time can also be said to be a mother's complaint. The next day, Comrade Liu Yong convened an apology meeting. The previous regulations were completely overturned, and voluntary donations were resumed. In addition to the person involved, Comrade Liu, admitting his mistake, District Chief Gao also frankly admitted his fault. This was the first time I saw this, and I was so moved that I shed tears. I believe that this not only does not harm the Party's reputation but also gives the general public a sincere understanding of care, knowing that the People's Government is sincerely, brightly, and greatly serving the people. I am a clerk at Zhengxing Tea Shop. I have done many informing things in the puppet era, but they were always ineffective. This time, with just a hasty page, there was a huge reaction. In addition to being willing to wholeheartedly support New Democracy and build the People's Republic of China, I am willing to participate in learning at a certain school to further understand the Party. I used to say that the Communist Party's words were sweet but harmed people deeply, but now I am enlightened." The letter ended by saying: "Let me silently read: China has a future under the leadership of the Communist Party. Without the Communist Party, there would be no China. Long live the Chinese Communist Party! Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Comrade Peng Zhen, who sincerely serves the people!" Many merchants outside Qianmen said, "The People's Government is truly just. In the Kuomintang and Japanese puppet periods, wouldn't they just assign you whatever amount they wanted, and who could you complain to!"

　　中共北京市委及救灾委员会
  　纠正错误募捐方式
    当事干部公开道歉，群众深受感动。
    【北京讯】京市各界救灾委员会日前对违反自愿原则，以强迫命令的方式募捐的第八区分会，进行了检查与纠正之后，获得广大群众的拥护与赞扬。
    该会所属第八区分会在进行募捐时，个别干部违反自愿原则，对前门大街捐款少的商户说：“你们这么大的买卖，捐这么少，不用捐了！”更三番五次将捐得少的商户找去个别谈话，末了还说：“你回去再好好想想吧！”这种形同强迫命令的募捐方式，引起商户群众不满，经该地市民张泽东以匿名书将经过情形报告中共北京市委会彭真，彭真立即将该报告转交北京各界救灾委员会，该会对此事十分重视，即日（十月三十日）由刘仁委员亲赴第八区分会检查，证明确有此种事实，当即召集干部，进行了批评和检讨，并即由负责干部亲赴曾经强迫募捐的各商户当面道歉，承认错误。第八区分会于三十一日又召集前门外大街四十余家商店开会，当场承认募捐方式的错误，并宣布取消以前形同强迫命令的捐款数目，由各商店再行自愿乐捐。市府于十一月二日所举行的政务会议上，亦对此事作了及时检查纠正的决定。这个措施，立即得到当地广大群众的感动和拥护，前门大街的恒升毓、同义永等商店，都自动将捐米数目提高了一百斤或五十斤。写匿名信的正兴茶庄伙友张泽东，又正式具名写信给中共北京市委会彭真，以表感激之情。原信称：“我们的领袖彭真同志：上次写给你的信也可说是一次妈妈状，翌日即由刘涌同志召开道歉会，以前规定完全推翻，重新自愿捐助，除当事者刘同志承认错误外，高区长亦坦白承认过失，这次我是首次看见，真感激的流下泪来。我认为这不但无损党的名誉，而且给一般市民真切的爱护认识，知道人民政府是真诚的光明伟大的为人民服务。我系正兴茶庄店员，以前伪时代一向干过多次告密事，总是无效，这次只潦草一页，就发生极大的反应，除了愿以万分热诚拥护新民主主义，建设中华人民共和国外，自己愿参加某校学习，俾以对党的再认识。以前总说共产党口甜害人不浅，现在觉悟了。”信末并称：“让我默读：中国在共产党领导下，才有前途，没有共产党没有中国，中国共产党万岁！毛主席万岁！彭真同志认真为人民服务万岁！”前门外的许多商户都说：“人民政府真是青天，国民党和日伪时期，还不是派你多少就多少，有什么意见向谁提去！”
