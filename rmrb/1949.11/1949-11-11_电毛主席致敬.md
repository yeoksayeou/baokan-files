Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 10th: The China Labor Association Representative Conference today passed a telegram of respect to Chairman Mao, the text of which is as follows: Respected Chairman Mao:

    The China Labor Association Representative Conference successfully concluded today, the 10th, in the people's capital of Beijing. We, on behalf of all members of the Labor Association, extend our most sincere respects to you. The Chinese working class, only with the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party headed by you, could unite the people of the whole country, carry out more than 20 years of arduous revolutionary struggle, and achieve today's historic great victory, enabling the 475 million people of the country to break away from the heavy oppression of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism for over a century, and embark on the road of independence and new life. The China Labor Association has explored this truth in its work and struggle. Since the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, the China Labor Association has resolutely supported the political call of the Chinese Communist Party, adhered to the unity of the working class, and smashed the shameless divisive conspiracy of the Kuomintang reactionary government. Today, because the revolution has been victorious, what follows will be a high tide of new democratic economic construction, and workers across the country must be organized according to industrial sectors in order to undertake the arduous task of developing production. The Labor Association is not a trade union organized according to the industrial system, so it is no longer suitable for today's trade union organizational principles. At this representative conference, based on the needs of the current victorious situation, we unanimously passed the resolution to end the organization of the Labor Association and further complete the organizational unity with the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. Members of the Labor Association will participate in various industrial trade unions in various places in accordance with the organizational system of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. The cadres of the Labor Association sincerely accept the leadership of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, consolidate their unity under the banner of the Chinese Communist Party and you, and strive to build an independent, democratic, peaceful, and unified New China, to build a new democratic society, and to further realize socialism and communism. We shout: Long live Chairman Mao, the great leader of the Chinese working class and the people of the whole country!
  All Representatives of the China Labor Association Representative Conference, November 10, 1949

    电毛主席致敬
    【新华社北京十日电】中国劳动协会代表会议今通过向毛主席致敬电，文如下：敬爱的毛主席：
    中国劳动协会代表会议已于十日在人民首都北京胜利闭幕。我们谨代表全体劳协会员向您致最崇高的敬礼。中国工人阶级，只有得到以您为首的中国共产党的正确领导，才能团结全国人民，进行了二十多年艰难困苦的革命斗争，而获得今天的历史性的伟大胜利，使全国四万万七千五百万人民得以摆脱百余年来的帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的沉重压迫，而走上独立新生的道路。中国劳动协会，在自己的工作和斗争中摸索到这一真理。从抗日战争爆发以后，中国劳动协会即坚决拥护中国共产党的政治号召，坚持工人阶级的团结与统一，粉碎了国民党反动政府的无耻的分裂阴谋。今天，由于革命已经胜利，随而到来的，将是新民主主义经济建设的高潮，全国工人必须按产业部门组织起来，才能担负起发展生产的艰巨任务。劳协不是按产业系统组织的工会，所以已不适合于今天的工会组织原则。在这次代表会议上，我们根据目前胜利形势的需要，一致通过结束劳协的组织，进一步完成与中华全国总工会在组织上的统一。劳协的会员，依照全国总工会的组织系统，参加各地各种产业工会。劳协的干部诚心诚意接受全国总工会的领导，巩固地团结在中国共产党和您的旗帜下，为建设独立、民主、和平、统一的新中国，为建设新民主主义的新社会，为进一步实现社会主义与共产主义而努力奋斗。我们高呼：中国工人阶级和全国人民的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！
  中国劳动协会代表会议全体代表  一九四九年十一月十日
