　　How Shanghai Carried Out the Work of Evacuating Refugees for Return to Their Hometowns and Production?
　　By our Shanghai correspondent Zhou Ziqin
　　Shanghai began evacuating refugees to return to their hometowns for production in early July. By the end of October, 99,666 refugees had returned to their hometowns. Together with the approximately 500,000 who returned home voluntarily after publicity and mobilization, this work has been successful. Most of these refugees came from rural areas in the interior, and some were landlords and rich peasants who had fled.
　　This work was carried out under the unified leadership of the Refugee Evacuation and Return Committee. The city was divided into twenty administrative districts, each with a work station headed by the district takeover commissioner, and three work teams were established to focus on the Yangshupu, Zhabei, and Xujiahui districts to create experience. The Shanghai Joint Relief Committee also participated in this work, absorbing several charitable organizations and welfare institutions.
　　The work began with key investigations and research. Each "bao" selected a "jia" as a typical case for investigation. The content included the characteristics of the area, the number of refugees, their living conditions, and their ideological concerns, which served as the basis for the work. Taking the investigations in Xuhui and Zhabei districts as examples, the initial ideological state of the refugees who were unwilling to return home had the following aspects: First, they believed that they would not be able to farm after returning home and that life would be hard; Second, would they still be able to get land and houses after returning home? They were afraid of being assigned remote or poor land and that the government would not care; Third, debts were not settled, and some were unwilling to give up their pedicabs or shacks because they could not sell them for money; Fourth, special agents spread rumors that they would have to join the army or provide war service after returning; Fifth, some even said: "Shanghai also has fields and foreign houses. The Communist Party represents the interests of the working people. I will also be able to get a share in Shanghai in the future"; Sixth, they observed: If the neighbors around them all go home, I will also go home; Seventh, landlords and local bullies were afraid of being liquidated after returning. In summary, they did not understand the policies and decrees of the People's Government or expressed doubts; this formed the main obstacle to the evacuation work.
　　Breaking through ideological concerns mainly relied on publicity and mobilization. The Shanghai Refugee Evacuation Committee instructed each work team: First, starting from the actual living difficulties of the refugees, use a homely approach to thoroughly understand the refugees' true thoughts, living characteristics, and personalities, connect them to long-term plans for settling down and establishing a career, and use accounting methods to break through the muddled thinking of "living one day at a time" in Shanghai; Second, based on various ideological concerns, under the policy of "Evacuating Refugees to Return to Their Hometowns for Production," widely and deeply conduct publicity and education to the refugees at various meetings to break through their concerns about not being able to settle down after returning home.
　　When Xuhui District started publicity, it adopted the method of visiting households and filling out registration forms. At the beginning, it publicized the benefits of "returning home," which caused dissatisfaction among the visited masses. Some slipped away as soon as they were approached, and some squatted nearby and watched without answering. Later, it was found that this method was not good and changed to starting from understanding their living difficulties and helping to solve practical difficulties, such as mediating disputes, providing relief for disasters, treating diseases, running night schools for literacy classes, and solving drinking water difficulties. Gradually, their relationship became close. When they had difficulties that could not be solved, they would come to the comrades at the work station. At this time, publicity was gradually carried out, and forums or individual visits were held, focusing on publicizing the policies of the People's Government, starting with their living difficulties, making them aware of the darkness and pain of the past society and the source of these pains, explaining the difference between the new society after liberation and the past, and explaining the nature of the government today to improve their class consciousness. Then, further guide them to consider their long-term happiness for settling down and establishing a career for their children and grandchildren, so that they realize that we are sincerely considering them, which can arouse their emotional resonance. There was an old woman, forty-nine years old, from Tancheng, Shandong, with a family of seven. She came to Shanghai at the age of thirteen. When talking to her for the first time, she said: "I am used to living in Shanghai, living here one day at a time, it is easy to get by!" After patiently persuading her from a long-term perspective, she was told: "Your son is growing up day by day. When he marries a wife and has grandchildren, the family will grow bigger and bigger. You have no land and no business in Shanghai. Everything costs money. How will you maintain your life in the future?" So she realized that living like this in Shanghai was not as good as returning home to build a family business, and decided to go back in the spring after the New Year.
　　Secondly, we should adopt the method of mobilizing the masses through activists. Xuhui District, through various trade union organizations (such as through the pedicab trade union to introduce activists among the pedicab drivers), first made friends, got to know them, and improved their ideological awareness. Then, through him, introduce some better friends and establish a certain relationship with them, providing them with books and newspapers to read. Some are through the relationship of "fellow villagers," and the relationship is quickly established, and they can talk to you about anything. In more than two months, Changshu District used these methods to cultivate and discover more than 30 activists, held special forums for activists to conduct education, and established a temporary mutual aid society for refugees returning home for production to study issues related to returning home. Xuhui District also had 53 activists, organized some production teams, specializing in dispelling refugees' doubts about not being able to make a living after returning home. After the work team introduced them, they first sent a representative, Qiu Xiaofeng, back to inquire about the situation. He reported back: The prices of various commodities in northern Jiangsu are lower than in Shanghai, the cloth is cheaper, there are many schools, and schooling does not cost money. The refugees who return can be allocated 1.8 mu of good land per person, and ordinary cotton fields can be allocated 4 mu per person. Houses can also be allocated. The government welcomes refugees who return home for production. Thus, the whole team dispelled their concerns. This enabled Shanghai to establish contact with the Yancheng County government, and the combination of the two made the work very convenient. Using this concrete fact to mobilize refugees to return home is much more effective than general publicity. This method is worth promoting.
　　In the past period, there were also many shortcomings in publicity and education. The main thing was that the concepts of "self-reliance," "labor production," and "settling down and establishing a career" were not sufficiently educated. Among the refugees who returned home, many did not clearly understand the concept of "returning home for production," so they made excessive demands on the government, wanting the government to solve all difficulties. They could not withstand setbacks, and when they encountered difficulties, they wanted to run back. This phenomenon occurred quite frequently.
　　During the formal evacuation work, due to the lack of meticulousness and depth in the work, the eagerness for quick results, the task viewpoint, etc., many problems also occurred. For example, many idlers and vagrants took advantage of the evacuation opportunity to impersonate refugees. After registering, they received travel expenses and train tickets and secretly slipped away, or ran back halfway; some peddlers also pretended to be refugees to receive travel expenses and tickets to do business back and forth, and "refugee traffickers" also took this opportunity to swindle money... In short, there were many loopholes and shortcomings in the work. The reason for these loopholes was that the complex situation in Shanghai was underestimated, and the registered refugees returning home lacked strict review and research, adopting a rough attitude, which was very damaging to the work. Now the Evacuation Committee has taken concrete measures, that is, in the future, refugees returning home must be organized and strictly reviewed and registered in advance. When leaving, unified purchase of train and boat tickets will be made, not issued individually. Travel expenses will not be issued in cash, but will be issued by each transit station in stages according to the number of people and the distance of the journey, in order to correct the malpractices caused by issuing cash. When refugees leave, they are organized into large, medium, and small teams according to the number of people. Each level of responsible person is elected by the refugees themselves. After the team is formed, the government issues the refugee return certificate, a letter of introduction to the local government, and a travel permit. Special personnel are sent to the transit station, and some even hold farewell meetings. These methods have proven to be better.

### 上海市疏散难民还乡生产工作是怎样进行的？

　　上海市疏散难民还乡生产工作是怎样进行的？
    本报驻沪记者  周子芹
    上海从七月初开始疏散难民还乡生产，到十月底已有难民九万九千六百六十六人还乡；连同经宣传动员而自动还乡者约五十万人，这一工作是有成绩的。这些难民大多数是从内地农村来的，有的是逃亡的地主富农。
    这一工作是由疏散难民还乡委员会统一领导进行的。全市按二十个行政区分设二十个工作站，由区接管专员兼任工作站长，并成立了三个工作队，分到杨树浦、闸北、徐家汇等区作重点工作，创造经验：上海市联合救济委员会也参加了这个工作，把若干慈善团体、福利机关吸收进来。
    工作开始是从重点调查研究着手，一个保选择一个甲作典型调查，其内容包括地区的特点、难民的数目、生活情况、思想顾虑等，作为工作进行的依据。以徐汇区闸北区的调查为例，难民最初不愿回家的思想状况有如下几种：一、认为回乡后不会种田，生活苦；二、回乡后是否还能分到田和房子？怕分给远田，坏田，怕政府不管；三、债务未了结，有的因有三轮车或棚屋不愿抛掉，想卖又卖不出钱来；四、特务造谣说回去要当兵，补出战勤等；五、更有一些人说：“上海也有田，也有洋房，共产党是代表劳苦人民利益的，将来我也能在上海分一份”；六、观望：看看周围邻居都家去，我也家去；七、地主恶霸怕回去要被清算，概括说起来，他们对人民政府的政策、法令还不够了解，或者表示怀疑；这就形成了疏散工作的主要障碍。
    打破思想顾虑主要依靠宣传动员，上海疏散难民委员会曾指示各工作队：一、从体贴难民实际生活困难着眼，用谈家常的方式，彻底了解难民的真实思想情况，生活特点与个性，联系到将来安家立业的长远打算，用算帐的方法，打破在上海混一天算一天的糊涂思想；二、根据各种不同的思想顾虑，在“疏散难民还乡生产”的方针政策下，广泛深入的在各种会议上，反复向难民进行宣传教育，打破其怕“回乡不能安家”等顾虑。
    徐汇区在开始宣传时，是采取挨户访问，填登记表的办法。一开头就宣传“还乡”好，引起被访问的群众不满意，有的一说就溜了，有的看到去访问，就蹲在旁边看，不答腔。以后发现这种办法不好，改为从了解他们生活上的困难，帮助解决实际困难着手，如调解纠纷，救济台灾，治辽疾病，办夜校识字班，解决吃水困难等，慢慢的和他们的关系亲切起来，当他们有困难不能解决时，就来找工作站的同志，这时就逐渐进行宣传，召开座谈会或个别访问，着重宣传人民政府的政策，先从他们生活上的困难谈起，使他们认识过去社会的黑暗、痛苦以及这些痛苦的来源，说明解放后的新社会和从前的不同，说明今天政府的性质，以提高他的阶级觉悟，再进一步引导他从安家立业及子子孙孙的长远幸福上打算，这样使他认识到我们真诚为他打算，能引起他的情感上的共鸣。有一位老大娘，四十九岁了，山东郯城人，全家七口。她从十三岁即来上海，初次向她谈话时，她说：“我住上海住惯了，在这里住一天混一天，倒也好混！”后经耐心的从长期打算进行说服，对她说：“你儿子一天比一天大了，娶了媳妇生了孙子，家口一天多似一天，你在上海既无地，又无生意，什么东西都得花钱，将来生活如何维持下去？”于是她认识到在上海这样混下去不如回乡建立家业，决定过年开春一定回去。
    其次，应该采用通过积极分子带动群众的办法。徐汇区通过各工会组织（如通过三轮车工会介绍三轮车夫中的积极分子），先交朋友，和他认识了，提高他的思想觉悟，再经过他介绍一些比较好的朋友，和他们建立起一定的关系，供给他书报看。有的是通过“老乡”的关系，很快把关系混熟，有什么话也能向你谈。常熟区在两个多月中，就用这些办法培养和发现了三十多个积极分子，专门召开积极分子座谈会进行教育，并成立了临时性的难民回乡生产互助会，研究有关回乡的问题。徐汇区也有积极分子五十三名，组织了一些生产小组，专门解除难民怕回乡后没办法生活的疑虑，经工作组介绍，先派代表仇筱峰回去打听情况，他回来报告：苏北各种物价都比上海低，纱布便宜、学校多，念书不用花钱，回去的难民每人可分到好地一亩八分，普通棉田每人可分到四亩，还可以分到房子，政府欢迎还乡难民回去生产，于是，全组解除了顾虑。这样使上海与盐城县府取得了联系，互相结合起来，工作非常便利。用这种具体事实动员难民还乡，比一般化的宣传有效得多。这个办法是值得推广的。
    在过去一个时期，在宣传教育上的缺点也是很多的，主要的是对于“自力更生”、“劳动生产”、“安家立业”的观点教育得不够，在还乡的难民中，很多对“回乡生产”的观念不明确，以致对政府要求过高，一切困难向都想要求政府解决，他们受不了挫折，遇到困难就想向回跑。这种现象发生是相当多的。
    在正式进行疏散工作时，由于工作上的不细致，不深入，急于求成，任务观点等等，也发生了很多毛病。如有不少无业游民利用疏散机会假冒难民，登记后领了路费和火车票，偷偷溜了，或者走到中途又跑回来；有的跑单帮的也假充难民领路费车票来回作生意，“难民贩子”也利用这个机会骗钱……总之，工作上有很多的漏洞和缺点。这些漏洞发生的原因就是对上海的复杂情况估计不足，对登记还乡的难民缺乏严密的审查研究，采取了粗枝大叶的态度，这对工作上是有很大损害的。现在疏散委员会已经采取了具体的措施，即以后难民还乡必须事先进行组织和严密的审查登记，走时统一购买车船票，不个别发给，路费不发钱，改由各转道站按人数及里程远近逐段发给路粮，以纠正发钱所产生的流弊。难民走时，是按人数组织成大队、中队、小队等，小队以下分若干组，各级负责人都由难民自己选出，编队后由政府发给难民还乡证及向当地政府的介绍信、路上的通行证等。由专人送到转道站，有的并举行欢送大会，这些方法证明较好。
