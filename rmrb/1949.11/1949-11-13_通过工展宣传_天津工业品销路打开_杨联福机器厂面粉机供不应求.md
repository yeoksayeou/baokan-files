    Through Industrial Exhibition Promotion
    Tianjin Industrial Products Sales Opened
    Yang Lianfu Machinery Factory Flour Milling Machines in Short Supply
    [Special Dispatch from Tianjin by this newspaper] Since the opening of the Tianjin Industrial Exhibition, it has achieved the effect of connecting urban and rural trade and promoting industrial finished products. During the exhibition, many factories, due to the opportunity for publicity and the detailed comparative research of visitors and purchasing personnel from various places, clarifying the advantages and disadvantages, have found new sales channels for their products in general. Among them, the flour milling machines of the machinery industry have the best sales. Yang Lianfu Machinery Factory has already ordered and sold twelve four-steel roller flour milling machines, including five ordered for Beijing and seven for Zhangjiakou. Another eleven Type C steel mills (corn flour machines) have been ordered. Currently, all the factory workers are working overtime day and night to rush to produce the finished products, but they are still in short supply, and even the flour milling machine displayed at the industrial exhibition has been sold. The Freedom-style continuous oil presses of the North China Agricultural Implement Machinery Factory have recently had contracts negotiated by representatives from Suiyuan, Qingdao, Jinan, Shijiazhuang, and other places, with more than ten units already ordered for sale. The Ri Xin Machinery Factory sold two sets of universal crushers to a certain unit of the Henan military. The Hengmao Iron Foundry has taken orders for many waterwheels. The Tianjin Steel Plant is unable to meet other orders due to undertaking orders from transportation agencies, but there are still many parties coming to negotiate. During the industrial exhibition, the Tianjin Metrology Manufacturing Factory received an order from the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau for 100 platform scales, and the payment has been fully paid. In addition, water pumps, bicycles, and Yunfeng incubators from other Tianjin machinery factories have all been contacted for orders or purchases from various parties.
