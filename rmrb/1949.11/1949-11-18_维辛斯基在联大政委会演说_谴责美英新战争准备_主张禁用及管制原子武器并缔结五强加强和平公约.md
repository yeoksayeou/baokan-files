Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 17th - TASS, New York, 16th. The United Nations Political Committee began discussing on November 14th the Soviet delegation's proposal regarding the condemnation of new war preparations, the banning of atomic weapons, and the conclusion of a five-power pact to strengthen peace. This day's meeting attracted special attention from the American public and foreign journalists, as the head of the Soviet delegation, Vyshinsky, was to deliver a speech. Before the meeting began, the venue was packed, and the proceedings were broadcast to the outside world via television and radio. After the Chairman of the Committee announced the opening of the meeting, Vyshinsky was invited to speak. Vyshinsky delivered a rich and lengthy speech, which every attendee listened to very attentively.

Vyshinsky said that the Soviet delegation, on the instructions of the Soviet government, submitted to the United Nations General Assembly on September 23rd a proposal regarding the condemnation of new war preparations and the conclusion of a five-power pact to strengthen peace.

This proposal can be summarized as follows: 1. Condemn the new war preparations being carried out by certain countries, particularly the United States and Britain. 2. Acknowledge that the use of atomic weapons and other means of mass destruction of mankind is contrary to the conscience and honor of all peoples and incompatible with the membership of the United Nations; the United Nations should no longer delay taking practical measures to unconditionally ban atomic weapons and establish appropriate and strict international controls. 3. Express the desire for the five major powers—the United States, Britain, China, France, and the Soviet Union—to work together to avoid the threat of a new war and for them to conclude a five-power pact to strengthen peace.

After reading the full text of the Soviet proposal, the head of the Soviet delegation pointed out that these recommendations are the natural result of the peaceful foreign policy that the Soviet government has consistently adhered to since the founding of the Soviet state. These recommendations are a manifestation of the consistent principles followed for thirty-two years since the founding of the Soviet Union, which the Soviet Union has always upheld in the United Nations and continues to uphold now.

　　维辛斯基在联大政委会演说
  　谴责美英新战争准备
    主张禁用及管制原子武器并缔结五强加强和平公约
    【新华社北京十七日电】塔斯社纽约十六日讯，联合国政治委员会于十一月十四日起开始讨论苏联代表团所提出的关于谴责新战争准备、禁用原子武器及缔结五强加强和平公约的提案。这一天的会议引起美国公众及各国记者的特别注意，因为苏联代表团团长维辛斯基将在会上发表演说。在开会以前会场就挤满了人，会议的情形并以电视和无线电广播向外传播。在委员会主席宣布开会后，即请维辛斯基登台发言。维辛斯基发表了内容丰富的长篇演说，每一个与会者都非常注意地聆听。
    维辛斯基说，苏联代表团奉苏联政府的命令于九月二十三日向联合国大会提出关于谴责新战争准备并缔结五强加强和平公约的议案。
    这一议案可归纳如下：一、谴责某些国家、特别是美国和英国所进行着的新战争准备。二、承认使用原子武器及其他大规模毁灭人类的手段是违背各国人民的良知及荣誉，并与联合国会员国资格不相容的；不许可联合国再事拖延而不采取无条件禁用原子武器，并建立适当的严格的国际管制的实际措施。三、表示由五强——美、英、中、法、苏共同努力，以避免新战争的威胁并由它们缔结五强加强和平公约的愿望。
    苏联代表团团长在朗读苏联提案的全文之后指出，这些建议是苏联政府自从苏维埃国家成立以来就始终如一地遵守着的和平外交政策的自然结果。这些建议是苏联成立以来三十二年里一贯遵循的原则方针的表现，苏联在联合国里向来维护并且现在还在维护这种方针。
