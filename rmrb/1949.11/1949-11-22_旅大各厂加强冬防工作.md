　　Lüda Factories Strengthen Winter Defense Work
　　[This Dispatch] (This Dispatch) Currently, major enterprises and factories in Lüda have successively begun to strengthen their winter defense work. The Inspection Section of the Sino-Chang Railway Dalian Factory convened a meeting of squad leaders of inspection teams from various workshops on October 29th to study winter defense work and discuss how to prevent various fire-fighting equipment from freezing. The Dalian Locomotive Depot strengthened its inspection work after reorganizing the Safety Committee on the 7th of this month, changing the past temporary sentry posts to permanent ones, and assigning a person to be responsible for each stove. A member study system was established to improve the business capabilities and vigilance of the members; and a large amount of fire-fighting sand was added. The Canal Fire Brigade accepted the lessons learned from the past lack of division of labor and insufficient fire-fighting equipment, dividing the 60 members into three shifts, and stipulating that each person is responsible for certain tools: such as water pumps, ladders, iron shovels, etc. The sack company under the Sino-Soviet Fisheries, in order to master fire-fighting techniques, more than 50 firefighters began business practice for one hour every morning in early October, and are now proficient in watering, communication, and orders; workers' dormitories and family houses are prone to fires, and places such as chimneys have been repaired. In addition, Far East Electric Power, Guanghe Machinery, the wharf, Dalian Transportation Company, and other units have also formulated winter defense work plans and have begun to deploy them. The paint factory under Far East Electric Power has added fire-fighting equipment such as hand-operated water pumps and iron shovels to strengthen fire-fighting equipment, and strictly implements the factory entry and exit rules. It is strictly forbidden to bring matches into the factory, and a strict no-smoking system is implemented in the factory. Outsiders must be allowed by the manager before entering the factory. Workers who work at night have a registration book and special entry and exit badges to prevent special agents from sabotaging. The Technology Department of Far East Electric Power established a Winter Defense Safety Committee in late October, and divided it into 50 groups, each with a group leader. In addition to dedicated personnel being responsible for each substation, two fire prevention groups were also formed at the headquarters, and it was stipulated that they should practice once a week, study fire-fighting skills once, and hold two to three meetings a month, and establish inspection and reporting systems. The wharf recently deployed units to take advantage of the warm weather to dry the fire-fighting sand to avoid freezing, and set up sand box covers to prevent water from leaking in and freezing. The fire hydrants are also covered with grass bags to avoid freezing. Dalian Gas Company is also carrying out insulation equipment for the water pipes in the field.
