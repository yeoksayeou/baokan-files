　　Mei! You say I left home without saying goodbye, haven't returned home for ten years, haven't sent any news, and don't care about the family's life or death, that I am ungrateful and unjust. Mei! How could I forget the parents who raised me and educated me, and how could I forget you, my beloved, who have been toiling for the whole family in my place! For the past ten years, during tense times of struggle, it was naturally difficult to take care of you. When things calmed down a bit, I couldn't help but want to go home and see my parents, Zhen'er, and you! But when I thought of the millions of people in China still suffering under the reactionary rule, and you also being ravaged by the enemy, and when I thought of the many revolutionary comrades who bravely fought and fell one after another, I restrained my heart. Until the last enemy is defeated, I should consciously suppress the thought of meeting you.

　　You say Dad and Mom don't know how many tears they have shed for me, especially during the New Year and festivals, they are always crying while eating, and the whole family can't control their emotions, always finishing the meal with tears. Mei! Which New Year or festival was it that I didn't miss you even more deeply? I remember that Mid-Autumn Festival night when I snuck away, I held little Zhen, trying to be calm, and sat in the yard with Mom and Dad. Mom and Dad were so happy, teasing their little grandson, and you were leisurely and lively, setting out snacks for us. At that time, I thought: when you find out you have lost your most beloved person, when Mom and Dad know they have lost their only son, I don't know how painful it will be. It was so hard for me. Every New Year and festival, especially during the Mid-Autumn Festival, this scene would float into my mind. But when I think of the fangs and claws of the enemy, the devastated China, especially when I think of the tens of thousands of comrades in the Communist Party who have given up their families and struggled for one or two decades, I cannot but resolutely abandon this weak and selfish sentiment.

　　Mei! I have never forgotten you, and I am not an ungrateful, unsentimental person. But for the liberation of the Chinese people, which is also our own liberation, I have to leave you temporarily.

　　Mei! You said that in the past, being separated by the enemy and unable to take care of the family was understandable, but now that the family is in such difficulty, it is ungrateful and unsentimental of me not to send a single penny home. You said that the whole family of four now relies solely on your monthly income of two hundred and fifty jin of rice from the school to maintain their lives, and life is very hard. I know that our family's standard of living is much lower than before, but the standard of living of the general population is even lower than ours. When more than eighty percent of the people are living in poverty, we cannot and should not expect to live too well. At the same time, we cannot be like the Kuomintang bureaucrats who disregard the life and death of the people and exploit as much money as possible to squander and enjoy themselves for their families.

　　You said that the family never has extra money to buy clothes, and the children's clothes are mostly altered from old ones. In the past two years, Mom and Dad's outer clothes also have patches, so Mom never wants to go out to play. Mei! If we compare ourselves with these people, our clothes are already heavenly! We should not compare ourselves with those vampires, corrupt officials, and bureaucrats who exploit the people, because they are not the same kind of people as us.

　　We are now on a supply system and cannot earn money to support our families, but the government does take care of the families of cadres. Those who have no land are given land, and those who have no labor force are given substitute cultivation. But for families like ours, although not well-off, we have enough to eat and wear, and our standard of living is already above that of the general population. How can we ask the government to take care of us? When the lives of the general population improve, our lives will naturally improve.

　　You said that the child graduated from elementary school at the age of twelve and even passed the first place in the whole class. There is no middle school in our area, and because we are poor, we cannot go to other places to study. The family also needs her to help Mom with some work, so she has been out of school for more than a year. Fortunately, you continue to teach her some every night, so she is still improving every day. You want me to find a way to get her out to go to school. Naturally, I also hope that she can come out to go to school, but which of the tens of thousands of cadres' children should not go to school? How can the public have the strength to provide so many children with public funding to go to school? Therefore, our organization stipulates that only children of cadres with more than fifteen years of revolutionary history who are out of school at home can be brought out to attend school. I have only been working for eleven years, which is not enough. Mei! Let Zhen'er just study with you! You must know that her situation is already considered good compared to other children, because she has already graduated from elementary school and has a good mother like you who teaches her to read. Mei! You will correct my view that not caring about the child's schooling is unsentimental, right?

　　The happiness of the people needs us to struggle and labor to cultivate bit by bit. Mei! The history of the revolution is written in blood. If the people in the revolutionary ranks do not endure hardship before enjoying happiness, it is impossible to lead the broad masses of the people, imperialism cannot be driven away, the feudal class cannot be overthrown, and the reactionary group of bureaucratic capital cannot be eliminated.

　　"The title of Communist Party member is the most noble." Mei! You should be proud to have such a husband, and you will also be comforted to have a husband who loves the broad masses of the people and does not haggle over the sentiments of his small family!

### 谈人情　一封家信

　　谈人情
  　一封家信
    恒
    梅！你说我不辞而别的离开了家，十年不回家，不通音信，不管家中死活，是忘恩负义，梅！我怎样能忘掉抚养我，教育我长大的父母，又怎样能忘掉我最爱的而又代我为全家劳苦的你呢！十年来在斗争紧张的时候自然难照应到你们，一到比较平静的时候，就禁不住要想回家去看看父母、珍儿和你！可是一想到全中国千百万人民还在反动统治下受着水深火热的苦难，你们也正在受敌人的蹂躏，同时想到许多革命的伙伴前仆后继英勇战斗的时候，就勒住了我的心，当没有把最后一个敌人打倒的时候，我该自觉的抑制住和你们会晤的念头。
    你说爸爸妈妈不知为我流了多少眼泪，尤其在过年过节的时候，老是在吃着饭哭泣，全家谁都抑制不住感情，总是含着泪吃完那一顿饭。梅！那一个年节我不也是更深的想念你们呢？记得我偷走的那一个八月中秋的晚上，我抱着小珍装着很镇静和爸妈坐在院子里玩，爸爸妈妈那样高兴逗着他们的小孙孙，你安闲而活泼的给我们摆点心，那时我想：到了你发现失去你最爱的人，爸爸妈妈知道失去他唯一的儿子时，不知要痛苦成什么样子，我是多么难受。每逢过年过节，尤其是中秋节的时候，这一幕情形就要浮上我的脑子。但一想到张牙舞爪的敌人，满目疮痍的中国。尤其想到共产党中成千成万舍掉家庭，奋斗一二十年的同志，我又不能不毅然决然地抛开这种软弱自私的情调。
    梅！我决没有忘掉你们，我更不是忘恩负义不近人情的人。但是，为了中国人民的解放，也就是我们自己的解放，我不得不暂时离开你们。
    梅！你说以前被敌人隔开不能照顾家庭，还情有可原，现在家庭这样困苦，我不捎一个钱回家是忘恩负义不近人情。你说全家四口人现在只靠你在学校每月二百五十斤米的收入来维持，生活过得很艰苦。我深知我们的家庭的生活程度是比前降低多了，可是一般人民的生活程度要比我们更低，在百分之八十以上的人都过着穷困的生活时，我们是不可能也不应该要求过得太好的。同时，我们更不能象国民党官僚那样不顾人民死活，剥削多少钱为自己的家人尽情挥霍享乐的。
    你说家里从没有余钱添配衣服，孩子的衣服多是旧的改的，近两年来爸爸妈妈外面的衣服也要打上补钉，妈妈因此从不肯出门玩玩。梅！我们要和这些人民比一比，我们的衣服还不是好到天上了么！我们不要和那些吸血鬼，贪官污吏鱼肉人民的官僚比，因为他们和我们不是一类的人。
    我们现在都是供给制，不能挣钱养家，但政府对干部的家属，是有照顾的，没有土地的分给他们土地，没有劳动力的另有人给他们代耕，但是象我们这样家庭，虽不算宽裕，但总算有吃有穿，生活水平已在一般人民之上，还怎样要求政府来照顾呢？一般人民的生活提高了，我们的生活自然会高起来的。
    你说孩子十二岁的时候就在完小毕业了，那时竟考上全班的第一名，咱那里没有中学，因为穷不能到外埠去求学，家里又须要她帮妈一些忙，这样已失学一年多了。好在有你每天晚上继续教她一些，所以总还一天天在进步，要我想法把她弄出来上学。自然我也很希望她能出来上学，但是成千万的干部的孩子那一个不该进学校呢？现在公家怎能有力量供给这样多的孩子公费上学？所以我们机关规定有革命历史十五年以上的干部的孩子，在家失学的，才能接出来入学。我参加工作才十一年还不够条件，梅！让珍儿就这样跟着你学习吧！要知道她的境遇比别的孩子已经算是好的了，因为她已经完小毕业并且有你这样的好妈妈自己教她念书。梅！你会改正我不管孩子上学是不近人情的看法吧！
    人民的幸福，需要我们斗争和劳动来一点一滴的培植的。梅！革命的历史是血写成的。革命队伍的人要是不吃苦在前享受在后，就不可能把广大的人民领导起来，帝国主义就赶不走，封建阶级就打不倒，官僚资本的反动集团也就消灭不了。
    “共产党员的称号是再高尚不过的。”梅！你应因有这样一个丈夫而骄傲，你也将以有一个对广大人民的热爱，而不斤斤为自己小家庭近人情的丈夫而自慰吧！
　　恒于十月三号
