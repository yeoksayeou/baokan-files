  　A Record of Events in Saving the Disaster
    Yang Xin
    Comrade! You ask me why I'm willing to take out this watch to help the disaster victims? Speaking of it, I really feel very ashamed.

    In the past, you know, I was a soldier in the Kuomintang reactionary army for more than ten years. "Being a soldier means eating the King's food," who cares what the price of yellow or white rice is. I often thought: since they recruited me to be a soldier, then: first, they have to issue me a gun, second, they have to issue me a uniform and food. "Iron camps, flowing soldiers;" flooded here, go there, drought there, run here; if the "disaster" affects the camp, how can it "lay waste" to me, a soldier!

    So, when I first arrived at our People's Liberation Army, I would sometimes complain to my superiors, saying: "Whenever we have free time, we're reclaiming wasteland, producing, and helping the masses; what…what's this for? The Kuomintang officers had long said: the King of Hell in the previous life had destined this portion of food for the soldiers, telling them to eat it and use it!" Cultivating land, cutting wheat, harvesting autumn, then why did I come out to be a soldier? ….

    These muddled thoughts turned in my head for several months, until the recent two months of grievance education, when comrades recounted their past painful lives under the oppression of warlords, bureaucrats, and landlords; I also personally saw many displaced disaster victims, carrying their children and hugging their daughters, weeping and wailing as they went to the mountains to dig wild vegetables to eat. Who doesn't have parents? Who doesn't have children? Whose parents of soldiers are not ordinary people? Natural disaster! Chiang's calamity! I…I really couldn't bear to think about it anymore, and the more I looked, the more heartbroken I felt. Lying on the earthen bed, I touched myself, and I still had a quilt; picking up the bowl, I could still eat a few bowls of fragrant millet dry rice every meal; this...isn't this all supported by the people, the hard-earned sweat of the laboring people! Lying down, eating, I don't know why, I always feel particularly uneasy! I thought: I used to be a sufferer myself, my father pulled a rickshaw in the city and had his leg broken by the police, my mother in the countryside was digging out the rotten bran from the bottom of the landlord's warehouse, grinding and shoveling it with great difficulty to raise me; after the War of Resistance Against Japan, Chiang Kai-shek drafted men, and we begged grandpa and grandma without success, so I was forced to come out and become a soldier.

    Kuomintang, reactionaries, I didn't come from there, but I haven't seen it: three consecutive years of water, drought, locusts, and hail, not only did it not provide any relief, but it also ruthlessly increased exorbitant taxes and levies. The peasants ate all the poplar tops, elm bark, sorghum shells, and wild grass roots; black-hearted Kuomintang! They seized fields and properties, and fooled around with women; they drew your tendons, and you still had to call them "great benefactors"! On the road, people and dogs, birds and beasts, were fighting for the meat of dead bodies. …What…what kind of world is this? This, in Chiang's bandit-controlled areas, isn't it very common! …

    Now, I have been in the Liberated Area for only five or six months, and I have seen with my own eyes that all levels of government, the Communist Party, the People's Liberation Army, workers, and students, as soon as they see the folks suffering from disaster, think day and night of ways to rush to plant, repair canals, dig wild vegetables, pick mountain fruits, donate clothes, raise funds, and automatically save food, vegetable money, shoes, socks…; from every leader to the orderly, the cook, they are all so diligent and busy; what are they doing all this for? Isn't it all for the sake of the common people!　　

    I…I am a person, the Kuomintang used to tell me to put on that "tiger skin" and specialize in scaring the common people, I simply forgot my roots! Today, the facts prove: I…when have I, in what place, seen such a good government, such a good army?! …

    I only hate that I didn't join the Liberated Area a few years earlier; striving to be a new person earlier. I only hate that I understand too few principles! I am suffering, I touched my whole body; really, I don't have a valuable thing that I can send to the folks to exchange for a few clothes or buy a few liters of rice; I…I only have this watch, and it's also dirty—it's still a ugly thing that I robbed in the Kuomintang side “making a fortune”. Return the people's things to the people! This…this is my true return to the embrace of the people, the beginning of being a new person!

    I am determined to be a People's Liberation Army soldier—the people's own soldiers; Comrade! Giving up my watch is a small token of my appreciation….

### 表　节约救灾中的一段记事

　　表
  　节约救灾中的一段记事
    杨新
    同志！你问我这回为什么舍得拿出这只表来救济灾民么？提起来，我真是感到非常的惭愧。
    过去，你知道，我是在国民党反动队伍里当过十来年兵的。“当兵吃粮”的，谁管黄米白米是啥价钱。我常想：既把我招来当兵，就：一要发我的枪，二要发我的军装发我的粮。“铁打的营盘，流水的兵；”这里淹了那里走，那里旱了这里奔；“灾”及了营盘，还能“荒”了我这个兵！
    所以，我乍到咱解放军不久，有时总抱怨上级说：“一有空就是开荒、生产、帮助群众；这……这是干嘛？国民党那边官长早就讲过：当兵的在前世阎王爷就注定了他这份口粮，叫他吃，叫他用的嘛！”耕地、割麦、收秋，那我又何必出来当兵？……。
    这些糊涂的想法，在我脑子里转了好几个月，直到最近两月的诉苦教育，同志们一个个叙述着他们过去在军阀、官僚、地主压榨下的惨痛生活；我又亲眼见到好多个流离失所的灾民，携儿抱女，哭哭涕涕的到大山林里去拔野菜吃。谁没有父母？谁没有儿女？那个当兵的父母又不是老百姓？天灾！蒋祸！我……我实在再没有心想下去，越看也就越感到心酸。躺在坑上一摸，我还有一个被窝；端起碗盏，自己每顿怎么也还能吃上几碗香喷喷的小米干饭；这……这还不都是人民所供养，劳苦人民的血汗！躺着，吃着，我不知怎的，总是感到特别的不自在呀！我想：我从前还不也就是一个受苦人，爸爸在城里拉洋车被巡捕打断了腿，妈妈在乡下刨着那老财仓库底下的沤坏了的糠，磨磨铲铲地好不容易才把我拉扯大；抗战以后蒋介石抓壮丁，求爷爷告奶奶的都没法生，我才逼着出来当了兵。
    国民党、反动派，我打从那达儿来，又不是没有看见：连着三年的水、旱、蝗、雹，它不但不给以丝毫救济，还狠命的加重苛捐杂税。农民将杨树顶、榆树皮、高粱壳、野草根都吃光了；黑良心的国民党！就从中抢田产，搞女人；抽了你的筋呀，还得你叫他“大恩人”！大路上，人与狗、禽与兽，在争抢着死尸的肉。……这……这是什么世道呀？这，在蒋匪的统治区，还不就是很寻常的事情！……
    而今，我到解放区还不过五、六个月，眼看着各级政府、共产党、解放军、工人、学生，一见着老乡们受了灾荒，就白天黑夜的想方法去抢种、修渠、拔野菜、采山果、捐衣、募款，自动节约食粮、菜金、鞋、袜……，从每个首长到勤务员、炊事员又都是那么的勤苦忙碌；他们，又是为了什么呢？还不一切都是为的老百姓！　　
    我……我是个人，国民党过去叫我披上那件“老虎皮”，专门去吓唬老百姓，我简直忘了本！今天，事实为证：我……我又在什么时候，什么地方，见到过这样好的政府，这样好的军队呢？！……
    我，只恨我没有早几年就投身到解放区来；争取早一些作个新人。我，只恨我懂的道理是太少了！我苦痛着，我摸遍了全身；实在，我是没有一件值钱的东西，可以送给乡亲们去拿来换几件衣裳或籴几升米粒；我……我只有这么一只手表，提起来也怪肮脏的——那还是我在国民党那边“发洋财”抢来的一件丑东西。人民的东西还给人民！这……这就算是我真正回到人民的怀抱，从新作人的开始吧！
    我既决心要当人民解放军——人民的子弟兵；同志！交出我的表是一点儿小心意……。
