　　TASS, Calcutta, November 27th: The Third Session of the All-India Peace Congress, held in the central square of Calcutta on November 26th, was attended by nearly 100,000 Calcutta workers. Red flags and portraits of Lenin, Stalin, and Mao Zedong were hung on the platform where the presidium of the congress was seated. A group of workers held a portrait of Ranadive, the General Secretary of the Communist Party of India. Waves of Calcutta workers—textile workers, railway workers, tram workers, printing workers, and steel workers—converged on the square, holding aloft red flags and banners calling for the struggle for peace and democracy and against the Anglo-American warmongers and their servitude in India.
　　Shadia, Chairman of the All-India Trade Union Congress and a participant in the Peace Congress, said: "We, the participants of this Peace Congress, representing the Indian people, assure the Soviet Union and Stalin that our people will never fight against the Soviet Union—the bastion of world peace and people's democracy, the great and powerful nation loved and supported by the working people of India and other countries." In his speech, he called on the Indian people to support the decisions of the All-India Peace Congress. Shadia said: "We will never fight for the imperialists. We must tirelessly expose the conspiracies of the Anglo-American warmongers and their accomplices in India." He criticized the Indian government's domestic and foreign policies, believing that these policies do not represent the will of the people but violate India's national interests and the working masses' aspirations for lasting peace. Shadia's speech was constantly interrupted by cheers from the audience, who shouted: "We will never fight against the Soviet Union! We will never be slaves of the United States!" "We will never allow taxes to be used for war!" "We will never allow troops, weapons, and money to be sent to fight the people of Burma and Malaya!"

　　红旗招展加尔各答
  　全印和平大会　十万工人参加
    高呼不为帝国主义者作战
    【新华社北京二十八日电】塔斯社加尔各答二十七日讯：十一月二十六日，在加尔各答市中心广场举行的全印和平大会第三次会议，几乎有十万加尔各答的工人参加。在大会主席团人员就坐的讲台上，悬挂着红旗和列宁、斯大林、毛泽东的肖像。一群工人举着印度共产党总书记兰那地夫的画像。一队队的加尔各答工人——纺织工人、铁路工人、电车工人、印刷工人和炼钢工人，高举着红旗和号召为争取和平民主、反对英美战争贩子和他们在印度的奴役而斗争的标语旗帜，向广场会合。
    全印职工大会主席、拥护和平大会的参加者之一夏狄亚说：“我们这个和平大会的参加者，代表印度人民，向苏联和斯大林保证：我国人民将永不对苏联——全世界和平与人民民主的堡垒，印度与其他各国劳动人民所热爱与拥护的伟大、强有力的国家——作战。”他在演说中号召印度人民拥护全印和平大会的决定。夏狄亚说：“我们决不为帝国主义者作战。对于英美战争贩子和他们在印度的伙党的阴谋，我们必须不疲倦地加以揭露。”他抨击印度政府的内政外交政策，认为这种政策不能表示人民的意志，而是违反印度的民族利益和劳动群众对持久和平的热望的。夏狄亚的演说时时被听众的欢呼声所打断，他们高呼：“我们决不对苏联作战！我们也决不做美国的奴隶！”“我们决不容许征税来从事作战！”“我们决不容许把军队、武器和金钱送去打缅甸和马来亚人民！”
