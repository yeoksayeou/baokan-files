　　Looking at Long-Term Construction
  　Nine Counties in Shanxi, Including Shenchi,
  　Deploy Winter Production
    [Our Newspaper] In the past month, counties in Shanxi Province, including Shenchi, Yushe, Xiangyuan, Huguan, Pingshun, Yicheng, Fushan, Linfen, and Hongdong, have convened representative meetings or cadre meetings to arrange and formulate winter work plans. In these plans, the leadership of winter production in each county demonstrates the following two main characteristics that differ from previous years:

    First, the formulation of specific winter production plans is based on the perspective of long-term restoration and development of agricultural production. The guiding ideology of directly preparing for next year's production is particularly evident. Some counties have also put forward the requirement to restore pre-war levels within two years, and gradually realize this plan by improving agricultural production conditions (such as fertilizer, tools, livestock, water conservancy, etc.). In addition to completing 7.7 million dan of fertilizer application this winter to prepare for next year's spring plowing and sowing, Yushe plans to apply 53 dan of fertilizer per mu of autumn land next year, and also plans to prepare enough fuel for eight months of burning next year. In addition to developing sideline production this winter, there are also plans to systematically develop animal husbandry, increase livestock, build water conservancy projects, and organize the elimination of mountain hazards, etc., to prepare for the development and improvement of agricultural production. Shenchi County has a lot of local mountain products, and emphasizes vigorously developing the weaving industry, completing 13,600 pieces (or sets) of manufacturing seeders, water dippers, saddle racks, baskets, grass baskets, and grass sieves this winter to prepare sufficient agricultural tools for farmers.

    Second, winter production is planned in accordance with the current new economic situation and in combination with the existing production base conditions. Xiangyuan and other places formulate plans for restoring and developing production based on the needs and possible production content and conditions this year. For example, Xiangyuan advocates vigorously developing the oil industry (especially pressing pure oil), weaving industry, transportation industry, and raising chickens and pigs; maintaining the status quo for the textile and coal industries, and transforming silversmiths, painters, and coppersmiths to other industries. In the arrangements for the large-scale development of the coal and iron industry and the transportation and sales industry, Huguan points out several new problems that must be paid attention to and solved based on years of experience and lessons; such as attaching importance to technical leadership and technical research to improve the quality of the coal and iron industry; and systematically organizing transportation and signing transportation contracts, etc.

　　从长期建设着眼
  　山西神池等九县
  　布置冬季生产
    【本报讯】山西省神池、榆社、襄垣、壶关、平顺、翼城、浮山、临汾、洪洞等县，一个月来，均先后召开当代会议或干部会布置与制定了冬季工作计划。在计划中，各县对今年冬季生产的领导，表现出以下两个不同于往年的主要特点：
    第一、从长期的恢复与发展农业生产的观点着眼，制定今年冬季生产的具体计划；而其中尤以直接准备明年生产为主的指导思想更为明显。有的县亦提出了在两年内恢复战前水平的要求，而在改进农业生产条件上（如肥料、工具、牲畜、水利等）逐步实现这一计划。榆社不仅为准备明年春耕下种今冬完成补肥七百七十万担，而且又计划明年秋地一亩上肥五十三担，并计划准备足够明年八个月烧的燃料。今冬除发展副业生产外，还要有计划地进行发展牧畜，增加牲口，兴修水利，组织消灭山害等，为发展与提高农业生产作准备。神池县当地山货多，即强调提出大力发展编织业，今冬完成制耧、水斗、鞍架、篓驮、草篓、草筛、箩头等一万三千六百件（或付），以准备充足的农具供给农民。
    第二、根据当前新的经济情况，结合旧有的生产基础条件，有计划的布置冬季生产。襄坦等地是根据今年需要与可能的生产内容与条件，去规定恢复与发展生产计划，比如襄垣提倡大量发展油业（特别是压纯油）、编织业、运输业以及养鸡喂猪；对纺织与煤业则维持现状，银匠、画匠、铜匠等改造转业。壶关在对于大量发展煤铁业、运销业等布置中，根据历年经验教训，指出若干必须注意解决的新问题；如重视技术领导与技术研究，提高煤铁磁业质量；有计划组织运输与订立运输合同等。
