　　Reliable Person
    ——A Short Story on a Train
    Zhang Ziqing
    The No. 12 express train from Tianjin to Beijing on October 26th was particularly crowded.

    A People's Liberation Army comrade was also squeezed into this carriage. His right hand stretched forward, and he called out, "Excuse me, pardon me." It seemed he wanted to squeeze into the military carriage, but how could he get through?

    "Comrade, just stay here! It's even more crowded over there," four or five people persuaded him simultaneously. They were very willing for the comrade to stay in this carriage. So the PLA comrade stayed in this carriage.

    The train started, the order settled down, and the PLA comrade sat on his luggage, reading a very thick book, probably a novel! Opposite the comrade sat a simple, young mother, breastfeeding an infant less than a year old.

    After a while, the child finished nursing and vigorously tilted his head back, opening his two dark eyes, his little mouth "Ah! Ah!" greeting the comrade. The comrade looked up, smiled, revealing a joyful expression.

    "Call him Uncle, sing a song for Uncle," the young mother looked at the comrade and happily taught the child.

    "The child is not shy!" The comrade smiled and praised the child.

    "No, he is quite shy, I don't know what's wrong with him today!" The young mother proudly said, "The child also knows that the People's Liberation Army are the people's soldiers!"

    The train was approaching its destination, and the towers of Beijing could be seen from the train window. Many people began to pack their luggage.

    "It's really troublesome, the child is asleep again, what to do when we get off the train," the young mother said, looking at her belongings, and then at the comrade. Obviously, she wanted to ask the comrade to help her.

    The comrade looked at her things, seemingly wanting to say: I can help you. But considering that the other party was a young woman, it was not convenient, so he didn't say anything and continued to read his book.

    The train entered the station, and people crowded towards the exit.

    "Let me help you carry it!" said another man in a suit.

    "No, I can take it myself," she politely declined again. After hesitating for a while, she resolutely said to the PLA comrade:

    "Comrade! Please help me take it down!" She finally handed the luggage to this reliable person, holding her child with a smile and squeezing off the train first. The comrade struggled to take the things and squeezed down as well.

　　可靠的人
    ——火车上的小故事
    张子清
    十月二十六日，由天津开往北京的十二次特别快车，乘客特别拥挤。
    一位解放军同志也被挤在这节车里，他的右手伸向前面，口里叫着：“对不起，劳驾，劳驾。”看样子是想挤到军人列车里去，可是怎么能挤得出去呢？
    “同志就在这里吧！那边人更挤。”四五个人同时劝说，他们极愿同志留在这里。于是解放军同志便留在这个车厢里了。
    车开行了，秩序安定下来，解放军同志坐在自己的包袱上，读着很厚的一本书，大概是本小说吧！同志对面坐着一位朴素的年青妈妈，抱着一个不满周岁的婴儿在哺乳。
    不一会，小孩吃完奶使劲仰着头，张大着两个黑眼睛，小嘴“啊！啊！”的向着同志打招呼。同志抬起头来，笑了笑，现出喜悦的样子。
    “叫叔叔，给叔叔唱歌。”年青的妈妈看了看同志，高兴的教着孩子。
    “孩子不认生！”同志微笑着夸奖孩子。
    “不，可认生啦，不知今天怎么啦！”年青的妈妈矜夸地说：“小孩也知道了解放军是人民的子弟兵了！”
    车快到了，从车窗可以望到北京的城头，很多的人都开始收拾自己的行李。
    “真麻烦，孩子又睡觉了，下车可怎么办。”年青的妈妈说着，看了看自己的东西，又看了看同志。很显然的，是想求同志帮助她一下。
    同志看了看她的东西，似乎想说：我可以帮你一下。但是考虑到对方是个年青妇女，不太方便，没有说，仍然看着书。
    车进站了，年青的妈妈除了小孩还有两个大包袱和一个提包，周围有三四个乘客都说要帮她的忙，可是她总是犹疑的说声谢谢，显然她怕遇到坏人乘机偷走她的东西，因为上车时就发生了这样的事故。
    车停下了，人们都向外挤。
    “我帮你拿一下吧！”又一个穿西装的男人说。
    “不，我自己可以拿走。”她又婉谢了。犹豫了一会，她便决然地向这位解放军同志说：
    “同志！请你帮我拿下去吧！”她终于把行李交给了这可靠的人自己抱着孩子微笑着先挤下火车，同志费劲的拿着东西也挤下来。
