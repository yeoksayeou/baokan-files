Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 27th: Polish News Agency, Warsaw - Minc, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party and Deputy Prime Minister of the Polish Government, recently published an article in People's Tribune discussing the planning principles of people's democratic countries. He stated that the planning principles of people's democratic countries are integrated with the class essence of these countries. In people's democratic countries, socialism has not yet achieved its final victory, and the new economic relations are not entirely socialist. However, people's democratic countries aim to transition to socialism and transform into socialist-type countries. This is why the plans of people's democratic countries, new socialist countries, cannot be something between capitalist anarchy and Soviet planning; it is socialist planning, and from its class essence, it is identical to Soviet planning. Thus, the nature of state industry in people's democratic countries becomes clear. This industry is the property of socialist-type countries and, in the hands of the proletarian dictatorship, constitutes the main lever for the socialist transformation of the state and the direction of the planned economy; it is socialist industry.

The state monopoly of foreign trade is one of the most important factors making it possible for the state to lead the entire economy. Trade and economic relations with the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries are new types of relations through which the planned economy of one people's democratic country is linked with the planned economy of the Soviet Union and with the planned economies of other people's democratic countries. The goal of these relationships is to help each other to achieve the most rapid development of the country's productive forces and to achieve the final victory of socialism. Without economic relations with the Soviet Union, without Soviet assistance, it would be impossible for people's democratic countries to maintain economic autonomy, they would succumb to the will and orders of imperialist plunderers, and would become backward appendages of the imperialist economy, completely unable to build a socialist society. The development of all aspects of commercial and economic relations between the people's democratic countries and the Soviet Union accelerates the development of productive forces and the victory of socialism in the people's democratic countries, strengthens their planned direction, and provides the possibility of expanding the scope of planned coordinated action between several countries. The Council for Mutual Economic Assistance is an organizational form that accelerates the accumulation of experience and the formation and crystallization of these new economic relations.

People's democratic countries are mostly agricultural countries or agricultural-industrial countries where small-scale commodity production predominates in agriculture. In these countries, the question of influencing agriculture in a planned way is a matter of paramount importance. The basic task at this stage is to lay the foundation so that the working peasants can enter collectivization as a whole and eliminate the rich peasants as a class. Then, a new period will begin, at which time the role and proportion of planning will be greatly expanded and deepened, and based on the role played by planned regulation, the state will be able to begin to directly plan agriculture organized according to collective principles.

Minc denounced Yugoslavia's so-called "development plan," stating that as a result of counter-revolutionary turmoil, Yugoslavia has become a fascist-type country led by a group of murderers and spies. In Yugoslavia, capitalist restoration is being carried out in accordance with the interests of capitalism. There is no plan to develop the national economy at all. The only plan consistently implemented there is a plan of colonial enslavement.

Minc concluded: To plan victoriously, it is necessary to plan in a socialist way; to plan in a socialist way, it is necessary to base it on the growing strength, potential, and organizational level of the national economy, and on the growing activity and political consciousness of the working masses. To plan in a socialist way, there must be a Marxist-Leninist party.

### 人民民主国家经济计划原则　波副总理明兹著文论述

　　人民民主国家经济计划原则
  　波副总理明兹著文论述
    【新华社北京二十七日电】波兰通讯社华沙讯：波兰统一工人党中央委员会政治局委员、波兰政府副总理明兹顷在人民论坛报上撰文论述人民民主国家的计划原则称：人民民主国家的计划原则，是和这些国家的阶级本质结合着的。在人民民主国家，社会主义尚未得到最后胜利，新的经济关系还不完全是社会主义的。但是，人民民主国家是把过渡到社会主义和转化为社会主义型的国家作为自己的目标的，这就是为什么人民民主国家，新型的社会主义国家的计划，不可能是介乎资本主义无政府状态与苏维埃计划之间的东西的原因，它是社会主义计划，从它的阶级本质上说，它是与苏维埃计划相同的。这样，人民民主国家的国家工业的性质问题就明白了，这种工业乃是社会主义型的国家的财产，并且在无产阶级专政的手中给国家之社会主义转化与计划经济之方向构成了主要的杠杆，它便是社会主义工业。
    由国家垄断对外贸易，乃是使国家领导整个经济成为可能的最重要因素之一。与苏联及其他人民民主国家的贸易和经济关系，乃是新型的关系，经由这种媒介，某一人民民主国家的计划经济与苏联的计划经济及与其他人民民主国家的计划经济的联系，便得到实现了。这些关系的目标，便是互相帮助，以达到该国生产力的最迅速的发展，和获得社会主义的最后胜利。假如没有与苏联的经济关系，假如没有苏联的帮助，人民民主国家便不可能保持经济的自主，就会屈从于帝国主义掠夺者的意志和命令，就会变成帝国主义经济的落后的附庸，而完全不能建设社会主义社会。人民民主国家和苏联之间商务与经济关系的各方面的发展，加速着人民民主国家生产力的发展与社会主义的胜利，强化着它们的计划化的方向，并为扩大几个国家之间有计划地配合行动的范围提供了可能性。经济互助委员会是加速经验积累、加速这些新经济关系的形成和结晶的组织形式。
    人民民主国家大多是小商品生产在农业中占优势的农业国家或农业——工业国家，在这些国家中，以有计划的方式影响农业的问题，是头等重要的问题。现阶段的基本的任务，是建立基础，使劳动农民能够全体进入集体化，并把富农作为阶级来消灭。然后，新的时期便将开始，在那时，计划的作用和比重将大为扩张和加深，基于有计划的方式进行调节所生的作用，国家将能开始把按照集体原则组织起来的农业直接计划化。
    明兹痛斥南斯拉夫的所谓“发展计划”称：由于反革命动乱的结果，南斯拉夫已变成由一群谋杀者和间谍领导的法西斯类型的国家。在南斯拉夫，正按照资本主义的利益，进行资本主义的复辟。在那里，谈不到任何发展国民经济的计划。其所一贯实行的唯一计划，就是殖民奴役的计划。
    明兹结语称：为胜利地进行计划，就必须按照社会主义方式来进行计划；要按照社会主义方式进行计划，就必须根据国民经济中日益增长的力量、潜在力和组织程度，根据劳动群众的日益增长的活动和政治觉悟。为了按照社会主义方式进行计划，就必须有马列主义的党。
