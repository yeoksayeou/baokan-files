　　Support the Government's Fiscal and Tax Policies
    Feng Zhong
    "Support the People's Government's fiscal and tax policy of taking from the people and using for the people!" When the second session of the Beijing Municipal People's Representatives Conference discussed the five fiscal and tax proposals put forward by the Municipal Government, twenty-four representatives spoke one after another, shouting out this unanimous voice. When the proposals were put to a vote, every representative raised their hand high. The Executive Chairman Xu Deheng solemnly asked again: "Those who oppose, please raise your hands," "Those who doubt or abstain, please raise your hands." The entire venue was silent, and not a single person raised their hand. This was followed by thunderous applause.
    The tax revenue of the People's Government is essentially different from the tax revenue during the rule of the Kuomintang reactionary government. As the representative of the Middle and Primary School Teachers' Union said in his speech: The Kuomintang was unlimitedly squeezing the common people, extracting money from them and using it as capital to oppress them; the tax revenue of the People's Government is to encourage production, develop production, and seek welfare for the common people, completely in line with the interests of the common people.
    Let us recall Mayor Nie's report at the conference! In just three months, the People's Municipal Government, according to the will of the people, has done many, many beneficial things for the people. Such as suppressing counter-revolutionaries, supporting production, developing education and culture, building a new city, handling public health and social relief, as well as planned improvements to tap water, rectification of sewers, and improvement of environmental sanitation... Which of these does not require money? In this year's budget for the second half of the year, operating expenses accounted for 40.8 percent of the total expenditure, and in the next year's budget, operating expenses will increase to over 50 percent of the total. In Chinese history, which government has ever allowed operating expenses to account for half of the total expenditure? Our People's Municipal Government has truly achieved taking from the citizens of Beijing and using it for the construction of Beijing.
    Some people say that the taxes and levies in Beijing are heavy now. However, the facts of the past tell us: At the beginning of Beijing's liberation, the People's Government first abolished the exorbitant taxes and levies left over by the Kuomintang, reducing the old tax system from thirty-seven types to twenty-one, and later reducing it by four more, leaving only seventeen now (after several tax items are merged after this conference, the tax items are even fewer). Why do a few people feel that the tax is heavy? Zhang Xianting, a representative of the business community, said in his speech at the conference: "During the Kuomintang rule, as long as taxpayers had some relationship with the bureaucrats, and secretly dredged up a little, they could pay less or not pay at all. Now some people say the tax is heavy, this is because they can't find any bargains." The tax revenue of the Beijing People's Government is indeed more than during the Kuomintang period. Many representatives who had paid taxes to the Kuomintang reactionary government told us: In the past, most of the taxes paid by the common people went into the pockets of a few people, and the amount that actually entered the treasury was minimal. Cao Jianrong, a peasant representative, said: "The Kuomintang 'big officials' did not do serious things at all with the money they collected. They took it home to buy property and land. They should have asked the people for one, but they asked for ten, they asked for a hundred." Zuo Guangyu, a stall vendor representative, said: "The Kuomintang reactionaries levied taxes and levies, causing us headaches." Yang Yisan, a Hui representative, is a small vendor who carries food on a shoulder pole. Yesterday he stood on the stage and recounted the pain before liberation: "In the past, our levies were more than the ninth-class levies (referring to the meaning of more levies). The local secret agents ate and took for nothing. If we showed a little unwillingness, we would have to pay a 'special levy.' In the past, the levies taken on the table were less, and the levies taken under the table were more, the levies taken on the surface were less, and the levies taken in the sleeves were more." The taxes and levies of the People's Government are all for public use. Although the tax items have been reduced, the actual amount of tax revenue has increased, and the reason lies here.
    Vice Mayor Zhang reported at the first session of the People's Representatives Conference: "Compared with the city's financial revenue and expenditure, there is a actual deficit of 24.06 million catties of rice, accounting for 56.27 percent of the total expenditure, that is, the income is only equivalent to 43.73 percent of the total expenditure. This deficit is subsidized by the North China People's Government, that is, the current Beijing expenditure still needs to be borne by the peasants in the North China Liberated Area." We must know: a farmer has to pay public grain, public grass, and also participate in war support and carry stretchers. The entire countryside has been supporting the front, and the farmers have shed blood and sweat, working hard for more than ten years, to exchange for today's victory. They have already fulfilled their greatest responsibility to the country and the nation, and the construction of Beijing should no longer be borne by them. Yesterday, a representative at the meeting proposed: at the next People's Representatives Conference, it is hoped that Beijing's financial revenue and expenditure can be balanced, and we can use our own money to do our own things. Now, under the support and encouragement of the People's Government, Beijing's industry and commerce have basically recovered; some have even developed, and the entire city's citizens have also obtained a good environment. Paying taxes is a due obligation, and should not be shirked. Pu Jiexiu, a representative of the business community, said at the meeting: "The people's war of liberation on the front line has not yet ended, and the construction work in the rear is being actively carried out. No work does not require funds. It is completely appropriate to use our money to build our own city." The people's government will not waste the people's money, but will not only make tax revenue be taken from the people and used for the people, but also try to make the taxation fair and reasonable as much as possible. Taxation is completely adopted in a democratic way, or dividing industries for self-reporting and public discussion (such as collecting business tax in the spring of this year), or using democratic evaluation methods (such as collecting "profit-making business income tax in the second half of 1937"). As Professor Fei Xiaotong said: "The spirit of the People's Government's taxation is scientific, reasonable, democratic, and fair." It is a natural reason that it can receive the unanimous support of all strata of the city.
    Professor Fei Xiaotong also said: To test whether a government is a good government, you must see who takes the money and who the money is used on. It has now been proven that the people's government takes money from the people and uses it on the people. This is a good government, the people's government.

### 拥护政府财政税收政策

　　拥护政府财政税收政策
    冯仲
    “拥护人民政府取之于民用之于民的财政税收政策!”京市第二届各界人民代表会议讨论市政府提出的五项财政税收提案时，先后有二十四个代表发言，异口同声地喊出了这样的声音。提案付诸表决的时候，每一个代表都高高的举起了手。执行主席许德珩慎重的再问：“反对的请举手”，“怀疑弃权的请举手”。全场静悄悄的，没有一个人举起手来。接着是一阵春雷般的掌声。
    人民政府的税收与国民党反动政府统治时期的税收比较，有着本质上的不同。正如中小学教联代表发言中所说：国民党是无限制的压榨老百姓，由老百姓身上榨出钱来，再用作压迫老百姓的资本；人民政府的税收是为了鼓励生产，发展生产，为老百姓谋福利，完全与老百姓的利益结合一致。
    让我们再回忆一下聂市长在大会上的报告吧！短短的三个月中，人民市政府根据人民的意志，替人民办了许多许多有益的事情。诸如镇压反革命分子，扶植生产，发展教育文化事业，建设新都市，办理公共卫生与社会救济，以及计划中的改进自来水，整顿下水道，改善环境卫生……那一项都需要钱？今年下半年的预算中，事业费已占总支出的百分之四十点八，明年度的预算中，事业费将增加到总额的百分之五十强。在中国历史上，那一个政府曾经让事业费占达总支出的半数呢？我们的人民市政府是真正做到了取之于北京市民，用之于北京建设了。
    有人说现在北京的捐税重了。但是，过去的事实告诉我们：北京解放之初，人民政府首先废除了国民党遗留下的苛捐杂税，将旧税制三十七种减少到二十一种，以后又减少了四种，现在剩下的仅有十七种（这次会议通过几项税合并后，税目更少了）。为什么有少数人感觉到税重了呢？工商界代表张献廷在大会上发言说：“在国民党统治时期，只要纳税人与官僚们有些关系，秘密的疏通一点，就可以少拿或不拿，现在有人说税重了，这是因为他们检不到便宜了。”现在北京人民政府的税收进款的确比国民党时期增多了。许多曾经向国民党反动政府纳过税的代表告诉我们：过去老百姓缴的税款大部分入了少数人的腰包，真正入库的微乎其微。农民代表曹建荣说：“国民党‘大官’们收了钱根本不干正经事。他们拿到家里置产买地，明明应该向人民要一个，他们就要十个，要一百个”。摊贩代表左广玉说：“国民党反动派征捐征税，征得我们脑袋痛。”回民代表杨益三是一个挑担卖食品的小贩，昨天他站在台上诉说了解放前的痛苦：“过去我们的捐比九等捐（指捐多的意思）还多，地方上的特务白吃白拿，我们稍微表示不乐意，嘴巴子还要上‘特种捐’，过去拿捐是桌面上的少，桌底下拿的多，手面上拿的少，袖子里拿的多。”人民政府的捐税是涓滴归公。虽然税目减少了，实际税收入库数目却增多了，原因正在这里。
    张副市长曾在第一届各界代表会议上报告说：“本市的财政收支相较，实亏二千四百零六万斤米，占总支出的百分之五十六点二七，亦即收入只相当总支出的百分之四十三点七三。这笔亏款依靠华北人民政府拨款补助，也就是目前北京开支还需华北解放区农民担负一部分”。我们要知道：一个农民要纳公粮、公草，还要出战勤、抬担架。整个农村都在支援前线，农民们流血流汗，苦干了十几年，才换来今天的胜利。他们对于国家民族已经尽了最大的责任，今天的北京市政建设再也不应让他们来负担了，昨天会场上已经有代表提议：在下次开代表会议的时候，希望能做到北京财政收支平衡，自己拿钱办自己的事情。现在北京的工商业在人民政府扶助鼓励下，基本上已获得恢复；有的且已有了发展，全城市民也得到了良好的环境，纳税是应尽的义务，不该推辞的。工商界代表浦洁修在会场上发言说：“前线人民解放战争还没有结束，后方建设工作正积极开展，没有一项工作不是需要款的，拿我们的钱建设我们自己的城市，是完全应该的负担”。人民的政府不会浪费人民的钱，不仅会把税收作到取之于民用之于民，而且还要尽可能的做到征税的公平合理。征税是完全采取民主方式，或划分行业自报公议（如征收本年春季营业税），或用民主评议的方法（如征“三十七年下半年营利事业所得税”）。正如费孝通教授说的：“人民政府捐税精神是科学的，合理的，民主的，公平的”。它能够得到全市各阶层一致的拥护是很自然的道理。
    费孝通教授又说：要考验一个政府是不是好政府，就要看谁拿钱，钱用在谁身上。现在证明了，人民的政府是由人民拿到钱，用到人民身上，这是好政府，人民的政府。
