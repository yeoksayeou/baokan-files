　　Learning from the Soviet Union, Learning Marxist-Leninist Theory
　　Ai Siqi
　　The Chinese people's celebration of the Soviet Union's October Revolution Day is more worthy of joy this year than ever before. The victory of the People's Liberation War overthrew the rule of the Kuomintang reactionary government and established the Chinese people's own country. The Chinese people can now establish friendly relations with the brotherly Soviet Union in all aspects through their own country, without being subjected to any obstacles, as was the case under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries.
　　For the Chinese people, what is particularly worthy of joy is that this genuine friendly relationship between people's countries is sufficient to guarantee that the Chinese people obtain full opportunities to learn from the Soviet Union in all aspects. In their future work, the Chinese people still have many things to learn from the Soviet Union, and they also need to learn Marxist-Leninist theory from the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union is the teacher of the revolutionary people of China, and first and foremost, the teacher for the Chinese people to learn Marxist-Leninist theory. As Chairman Mao said: ————
　　"The Chinese found Marxism through the introduction of the Russians. Before the October Revolution, the Chinese not only did not know Lenin and Stalin, but also did not know Marx and Engels. The October Revolution gave us Marxism-Leninism with a bang. The October Revolution helped the advanced elements all over the world, including China, to use the proletarian worldview as a tool for observing the destiny of the country and reconsider their own problems. Taking the road of the Russians – that is the conclusion." (On the People's Democratic Dictatorship)
　　The Soviet Union's introduction of Marxism-Leninism to China was an incomparably significant help to the Chinese people, the significance of which "outweighs a million soldiers." If anyone still doubts that the Soviet Union has not given enough help to China? It is enough to point out this one significance! "Thank you Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, they gave us weapons. These weapons are not machine guns, but Marxism-Leninism." The Chinese people obtained the weapon of Marxism-Leninism and combined it with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution, which completely changed the face of the Chinese revolution. For twenty-eight years, the Chinese Communist Party has led the people in earth-shattering revolutionary struggles, overthrowing the rule of feudal forces that lasted for thousands of years and the rule of imperialist bureaucratic capitalist forces that lasted for a hundred years, and replacing them with the rule of the people. An inseparable great fact from this great victory of the Chinese people is that their own leader, Comrade Mao Zedong, who is proficient in Marxist-Leninist theory and good at guiding the revolution to victory, has emerged from among the Chinese people.
　　The Chinese people learned Marxist-Leninist theory under extremely difficult conditions. The general backwardness of China's economy and culture, the cruel oppression of the reactionary rulers, and the arduous process of revolutionary struggle gave great obstacles to our learning. Subjectively, we also took the wrong paths of dogmatism and empiricism. These conditions show that, apart from many revolutionary leaders headed by Comrade Mao Zedong who have mature Marxist-Leninist theoretical cultivation, among the vast majority of our cadres, the level of theoretical knowledge of Marxism-Leninism is still very low. We even lack the most basic theoretical knowledge. This situation is extremely incompatible with the increasingly complex revolutionary tasks of China in the future. The tasks of the work require us to learn with great effort, and we must start from scratch. Our vast number of cadres are now beginning to realize this, and a mass learning movement is flourishing.
　　In our learning today, one point must be clearly understood: Marxist-Leninist theory is a science, a systematic knowledge of the historical laws of the material development of the world and social development. To be familiar with such a science, it requires persistent and continuous, arduous efforts, and cannot be satisfied with a smattering of knowledge, and cannot give up halfway. In the beginning of learning, it is also necessary to establish some basic ideological viewpoints and work viewpoints as the basis as much as possible with more systematic theoretical knowledge, to break down some old, wrong ideological viewpoints and work viewpoints. Learning must be combined with practice, and must transform ideology and work style in learning. However, without correct theory, without systematic, orderly scientific knowledge, or so-called "academic" knowledge, it is impossible to truly achieve the goal of transforming ideology and transforming work style. Many people's minds are full of various factual materials, full of all kinds of fragmentary feelings, but without orderly knowledge and systematic theory. Therefore, the working method is to treat the head when the head aches, and treat the foot when the foot hurts, and it is impossible to distinguish what is primary and secondary, and what is important and urgent. Insisting on this kind of thinking and style, and despising theory and "academic," is a characteristic of empiricism. Learning Marxist-Leninist theory is to strive to systematically understand the laws of the development of things and overcome the shortcomings of empiricism. Of course, in learning, we must conscientiously prevent the tendency of dogmatism, prevent the separation of theory from practice, for example, thinking that talking about theory is one thing, and solving specific ideological problems and work problems is another, and that the former is "academic" while the latter has nothing to do with "academic." And do not know that true "academic," true science, lies in systematically and theoretically solving ideological problems and work problems. But now we need to break down another obstacle of subjectivism, thinking that solving ideological problems does not require systematic scientific theory and historical law knowledge, does not require "academic," and even thinks that talking more about "academic," talking more about theory, and talking more about historical law knowledge, as if it would hinder us from establishing revolutionary ideological viewpoints, and do not know that true Marxist-Leninist revolutionary ideological viewpoints must have the foundation of its scientific historical law knowledge, and must have the foundation of its revolutionary "academic" and theory.
　　The existence of these tendencies and obstacles shows how naive we are in front of Marxist-Leninist theory, and shows how much more effort we need to make to grow up in theoretical learning, so that we can be competent in the great Chinese revolution and construction work. Here, in addition to our own efforts, we need the help of our Soviet brothers. We hope to do more introduction work on the theoretical aspects of the Soviet Union, hope to find ways to learn from the works of Soviet comrades, and also hope to have the opportunity to directly receive the teachings of Soviet comrades. The Soviet Union has already given us incomparably significant help in this regard in the past, and of course it will give us the same significant help in the future.

　　学习苏联，学习马列主义理论
    艾思奇
    中国人民庆祝苏联的十月革命节，是从来没有象今年这样值得高兴的。人民解放战争的胜利，推翻了国民党反动政府的统治，建立了中国人民自己的国家。中国人民现在可以通过自己的国家，与兄弟国苏联建立一切方面的友谊关系，而不至于受到任何障碍，如象在国民党反动派统治下的情形那样。
    对于中国人民，其所以特别值得高兴，是人民国家中间的这种真实的友谊关系，足以保证中国人民获得充分机会从各方面来学习苏联。中国人民在今后的工作中还有很多事要向苏联学习，也还要向苏联学习马列主义的理论。苏联是中国革命人民的老师，而首先和主要的是中国人民学习马列主义理论的老师。正如毛主席说的：————
    “中国人找到马克思主义，是经过俄国人介绍的。在十月革命以前，中国人不但不知道列宁、斯大林，也不知道马克思、恩格斯。十月革命一声炮响，给我们送来了马克思列宁主义。十月革命帮助了全世界也帮助了中国的先进分子，用无产阶级宇宙观作为观察国家命运的工具，重新考虑自己的问题。走俄国人的路——这就是结论。”（论人民民主专政）
    苏联人给中国介绍马列主义，对中国人民是一个重大无比的帮助，其意义“胜过百万雄兵”。如果还有人怀疑苏联对中国帮助不够吗？只要指出这一点意义就够了！“谢谢马克思、恩格斯、列宁和斯大林，他们给了我们以武器。这武器不是机关枪，而是马克思列宁主义。”中国人民得到了马克思列宁主义的武器，并使之与中国革命的具体实践相结合，就把中国革命的历史完全改变了面目。二十八年来，中国共产党领导人民进行了惊天动地的革命斗争，把几千年间的封建势力和百年间的帝国主义官僚资本主义势力的统治推翻，而代之以人民的统治。与中国人民的这个伟大胜利不可分的一件伟大事实，就是从中国人民中间产生了自己的精通马列主义理论而善于指导革命走向胜利的领袖——毛泽东同志。
    中国人民学习马列主义理论是在极艰难的条件之下走过来的。中国经济和文化一般的落后，反动统治者的残酷压迫和革命斗争的艰苦过程，给了我们的学习以极大的障碍，在主观上我们又走过教条主义和经验主义的错路。这些条件说明除了以毛泽东同志为首的许多具有着成熟了的马列主义理论修养的革命领导者之外，在我们极多数的干部中间，马列主义的理论知识水平还是很低，我们甚至于缺乏最基本的理论知识，这种情形，与中国今后愈益复杂的革命任务极不相称。工作的任务需要我们用很大的力量来学习，而且要从头学起。我们的广大干部现在都开始有此觉悟，群众性的学习运动正在蓬勃高涨。
    在我们今天的学习当中，有一点必须要认识清楚的，那就是：马列主义的理论是一种科学，是关于世界物质发展和社会发展的有系统的历史规律知识。要熟悉这样的科学，需要持久不断的、艰苦的努力，不能以一知半解为满足，不能半途而废。在初学的时候，也必须要尽可能地以较有系统的理论知识作为基础来建立一些基本的思想观点和工作观点，来打破若干旧的、错误的思想观点和工作观点。学习必须联系实际，必须在学习当中改造思想和改造工作作风。但是，没有正确的理论，没有有系统的、有条理的科学性的知识，或者叫做“学术”性的知识，是不可能真正达到改造思想、改造工作作风的目的的。许多人头脑里充满着五花八门的事实材料，充满着各式各样的片段感想，而没有条理的知识和系统的理论，因此工作方法是头痛医头，脚痛医脚，分不清什么是主要次要，什么叫轻重缓急。坚持这种思想和作风，轻视理论、轻视“学术”，是经验主义的特征。学习马列主义的理论，就是要努力有系统地来认识事物发展的规律，克服经验主义的毛病。当然，在学习的时候，我们要认真防止教条主义的倾向，防止使理论从实际脱离，例如认为讲理论是一回事，解决具体思想问题和工作问题是另一回事，前者才是“学术”，而后者与“学术”无关。而不知道真正的“学术”，真正的科学，就在于要对思想问题和工作问题作系统性的、理论性的解决。但我们现在更要打破另一种主观主义的障碍，以为解决思想问题不需要有系统的科学理论和历史规律知识，不需要“学术”，甚至于认为多谈“学术”、多谈理论，多谈历史规律知识，就好象会要妨害我们建立革命思想观点，而不知道真正马列主义的革命思想观点，必须一定要有其科学的历史规律知识的基础，必须一定要有其革命的“学术”、理论的基础。
    这些倾向和障碍的存在，说明我们在马列主义理论前面是如何幼稚，说明我们自己还需要尽多大的努力，才能在理论学习中间成长起来，使自己在伟大的中国革命和建设工作岗位上能够称职。在这里，我们除了自己要首先努力之外，就需要苏联的兄弟的帮助。我们希望多多做苏联的理论方面的介绍工作，希望自己设法向苏联同志的著作中学习，也希望有机会直接得到苏联同志们的教益。苏联在这方面过去既已经对我们给过重大无比的帮助，今后当然还会给我们同样重大的帮助。
