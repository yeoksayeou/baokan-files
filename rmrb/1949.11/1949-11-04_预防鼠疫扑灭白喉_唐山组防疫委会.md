　　[This newspaper reporter from Tangshan reports] To prevent plague and eradicate diphtheria, which has occurred in the suburbs of the city, the Tangshan Municipal Government convened a health work conference on the 1st. The conference elected Mayor Li Yifu and others to form an Epidemic Prevention Committee and decided to launch a mass health and epidemic prevention campaign. The steps for carrying out the work are as follows: The first week will be a week of publicity and mobilization. The symptoms of the epidemic, the means of transmission, and prevention methods will be widely publicized through newspapers, radio broadcasts, and wall posters to arouse public vigilance; the second week will be dedicated to a cleaning and sanitation campaign to catch rats and kill fleas, with the participation of the Health Brigade for quarantine and treatment. To prevent the invasion of the epidemic into the city, it was decided to set up a quarantine station at the railway station and temporary quarantine stations on the main roads leading to the Great Wall passes, and to set up an isolation hospital. All public and private hospitals and medical departments in the city are organized into seven teams, four independent groups, and four health schools are organized into a reserve team to carry out quarantine work. Direct contact will be maintained with Qinhuangdao, Tianjin, Zunhua and other places to pay attention to the development of the epidemic.
