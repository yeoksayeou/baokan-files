Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 3rd. Since September, cities with a population of over 30,000 in the Northeast have successively convened People's Representative Conferences, achieving considerable success and accumulating experience. According to preliminary statistics, a total of fifty-eight cities have already convened People's Representative Conferences, including twenty-five cities and thirty-three county town districts. The conferences generally lasted three to six days. Representatives were selected through direct election, indirect election, or appointment, and included representatives from all revolutionary classes, ethnic minorities, various professional groups, the military, government organizations, and regions. Due to the different sizes of the cities, the number of representatives ranged from a maximum of 428 in Shenyang to a minimum of 48 in Keshan County, Heilongjiang.

The main achievements of the People's Representative Conferences in various places are the effective resolution of several major current issues based on local characteristics and the needs of the masses. About twenty-two cities (especially disaster-stricken areas) discussed issues of production, conservation, disaster relief, and preparations for famine, and twelve cities made specific resolutions. Yingkou, Tai'an, Anda, Lishu, Nehe and other cities and counties further studied methods for carrying out various sideline productions. Some cities organized thrift committees and passed plans for future conservation and famine preparedness. In industrial cities such as Anshan, Benxi, Fushun, Fuxin, and Beipiao, the People's Representative Conferences focused on discussing how to serve factories and mines, production and conservation, and urban management. The People's Representative Conferences in these cities stipulated specific methods for factory management and rewarding rationalization proposals, and discussed the direction of industrial and commercial development in mining areas, thereby further improving the production enthusiasm of workers in state-owned enterprises and generally enhancing the production sentiment of people from all walks of life. People's Representative Conferences in Shenyang, Jinzhou, Andong, Jilin, Harbin, Changchun, Qiqihar and other cities adopted plans for handling labor-capital disputes and concluding collective labor contracts, and reasonably resolved some disputes between labor and capital based on the spirit of developing production for the benefit of both labor and capital. Changchun, Keshan and other cities and counties further decided to mobilize idle funds and frozen capital to invest in industrial production, and tried to solve the difficulties of private industries in terms of raw materials and sales, thereby eliminating the concerns of private industrialists and businessmen who dared not develop production. In cities with more serious housing problems, such as Jinzhou, Jilin, Qiqihar, Suihua, and Tai'an, the issue of housing ownership and rent was discussed, and it was decided to establish private housing ownership, issue new housing licenses, organize property management committees, uniformly manage public housing, and formulate public property management methods. In other places, thorough discussions were also held on urban organization, street construction, citizen education, anti-espionage and fire prevention, and appropriate measures were formulated.

The representatives participating in the representative conferences in various places came from a wide range of backgrounds, and relatively in-depth mobilization and publicity work was carried out before the meetings. As a result, the general public recognized that the representative conferences were discussing matters closely related to themselves, so they enthusiastically put forward their hopes and demands, and asked the representatives to bring them to the meetings for discussion. During the discussions of motions of extreme concern to the people, the meetings in various places promoted the spirit of the representatives knowing everything and saying everything, so that the problems solved were more practical and feasible. The representatives criticized certain shortcomings in the government's work. The government also sincerely accepted the criticisms of the representatives and made self-criticisms. At the Harbin People's Representative Conference, Zhang Ce, secretary of the Songjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, called on the representatives to recognize the benefits of democracy and actively criticize the work of the government, which gave everyone great emotion and enlightenment. At the meetings in some places, the representatives criticized the bureaucratic style of some administrative personnel, and the government departments then made appropriate handling based on this. After the representative conference, the Shenyang Municipal Government specifically convened a cadre meeting to rectify its work style. Other places also decided to change the style of cadres by strengthening education and strictly enforcing rewards and punishments, and rectifying discipline. After the People's Representative Conferences were held in various places, the relationship between the government and the people generally became closer than in the past.

A few points of experience: Adequate preparation, extensive representation, focused issues, and communicated resolutions.

The People's Representative Conferences held in fifty-eight cities in Northeast China have generally gained the following experiences: (1) It is necessary to do a good job in preparation, which is crucial to the success of the meeting. For example, Jilin City grasped the problems that the masses urgently needed to solve before the meeting, made full investigations and studies in advance, and also conducted deliberations among the masses, so that the meeting had a more satisfactory solution to the three major problems of production and conservation, collective contracts, and housing ownership, and people from all walks of life were very satisfied. Before the conference was held in Dalian, a publicity outline was formulated and in-depth publicity was carried out through various forms to collect opinions, so good results were obtained. The representatives' own preparation is also very important. It is necessary to educate and help them to take the initiative to go deep into the masses to collect opinions before the meeting. (2) Pay attention to the breadth and representativeness of the representatives. According to the different sizes, natures, populations, and occupations of the cities, try to include representatives from all aspects in order to achieve the effect of gathering ideas and benefiting each other; at the same time, attention should be paid to actually reflecting the leading role of the working class in the meeting, and actively uniting all revolutionary strata. (3) The content of the meeting should have a center. According to the situation at the time and the urgent requirements of the masses, problems should be raised and solved, otherwise the meeting will inevitably disperse its strength or become a formality. (4) After the meeting is over, people's representatives should be quickly organized to earnestly carry out communication, and mobilize the masses to discuss the government report and important resolutions at the meeting, so that these resolutions can be truly understood and accepted by the masses and transformed into the actions of the masses. The representatives of the Henan District of Jilin gathered activists and village cadres in the entire district to hold a meeting to convey the resolutions, and a heated discussion was launched at the meeting, and many specific methods were formulated for the item of production and conservation, which is a very good example.

　　东北二十五个市三十三个县城
  　相继召开人民代表会议
    【新华社沈阳三日电】东北全境三万人口以上的城市，九月份以来已相继召开了人民代表会议，并取得了相当的成绩和经验。据初步统计：已经召开了人民代表会议的城市共有五十八个，包括二十五个市及三十三个县城关区。会议一般历时三天至六天。代表们由直接选举、间接选举或聘请三种方式产生，包括了各革命阶级、少数民族、各种职业团体、部队、机关和地区的代表。由于城市大小的不同，代表人数最多者如沈阳市为四百二十八人，最少者如黑龙江克山县为四十八人。
    各地人民代表会议的主要收获，是根据当地特点与群众需要有效地解决了当前若干重大问题。约有二十二个城市（特别是灾荒地区）讨论了生产节约救灾备荒问题，并有十二个城市作出具体决议。营口、泰安、安达、梨树、讷河等市县更研究了进行各项副业生产的办法。有的城市则组织了节约委员会，通过了今后的节约备荒计划。在鞍山、本溪、抚顺、阜新、北票等工业城市，人民代表会议即以讨论如何全力为工厂、矿山生产服务、生产节约、城市管理等问题为中心。这些城市的人民代表会议规定了工厂管理和奖励合理化建议的具体办法，讨论了矿区工商业发展的方向，因此进一步提高了国营企业职工的生产积极性，也普遍提高了各阶层人民的生产情绪。沈阳、锦州、安东、吉林、哈尔滨、长春、齐齐哈尔等城市的人民代表会议，通过了处理劳资争议和订立劳动集体合同的方案，根据发展生产劳资两利的精神，合理解决了劳资双方的若干争议问题。长春、克山等市县更确定动员游资及冻结资金投向工业生产，设法解决私营工业原料和销路的困难，因而消除了私营工商业者不敢发展生产的顾虑。在房屋问题比较严重的城市，如锦州、吉林、齐齐哈尔、绥化、泰安等地，则讨论了房权、房租问题，决定确立私有房权，发给新房照，组织房产管理委员会，统一管理公有房产，制订公产管理办法等。其他各地在城市组织、街道建设、市民教育、防奸防火等方面也都进行了缜密的讨论，定出了妥贴的办法。
    各地参加代表会议的代表，范围相当广泛，会前又作了比较深入的动员和宣传工作，因之一般群众都认识到代表会议讨论的是与自己密切相关的事情，因此就热烈地提出自己的希望和要求，让代表带到会议上来讨论。各地会议在讨论人民极端关切的议案时，均发扬了代表们知无不言、言无不尽的精神，使所解决的问题较为切实可行。代表们批评了政府工作中的某些缺点。政府也诚恳地接受了代表们的批评，并作了自我检讨。哈尔滨人民代表会上，中共松江省委书记张策号召代表们认识民主的好处，积极批评政府的工作，给大家以很大的感动和启发。在若干地方的会议上，代表们对某些行政人员的官僚主义作风提出批评，接着政府部门即据以作了适当处理。沈阳市政府曾在代表会后专门召开干部会议进行整顿作风。其他各地也都决定以加强教育和严明奖惩、整饬纪律等办法来转变干部作风。各地人民代表会议召开后，政府与人民的联系一般地都较过去密切了。
　　几点经验　准备要充分　代表要广泛　问题要集中　决议要传达
    东北五十八个城市举行的人民代表会议，普遍获得以下几点经验：（一）必须做好准备工作，这对于开好会议具有决定作用。如吉林市在会前掌握了群众迫切需要解决的问题，预先作充分的调查研究，同时并在群众中进行酝酿，因此使会议对生产节约、集体合同、房权三大问题有了比较圆满的解决，各界人民都很满意。大连市在会议召开前，制定宣传提纲，通过各种形式，进行深入宣传，收集意见，因此得到了良好的效果。代表本身的准备工作也很重要。必须教育和帮助他们会前主动地深入群众中去收集意见。（二）注意代表的广泛性和代表性，应根据城市大小、性质、人口、职业的不同，尽量作到使代表包括各方面的人物，以便收到集思广益的效果；同时又应注意在会议中实际体现出工人阶级的领导作用，做到主动团结各革命阶层。（三）会议内容要有中心，要根据当时当地的情况与群众的迫切要求，提出问题并解决问题，否则必然使会议分散力量或流于形式。（四）会议开完以后，应迅速组织人民代表认真地进行传达，并发动群众讨论政府报告和会上的重要决议，使这些决议真正为群众了解和接受，变为群众的行动。吉林河南区的代表回去后，即召集全区积极分子和村干部开会，传达决议，会上展开了热烈的讨论，对生产节约一项订出了很多具体办法，就是很好的例子。
