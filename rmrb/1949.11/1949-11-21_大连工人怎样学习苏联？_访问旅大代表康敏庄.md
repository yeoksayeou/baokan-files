　　How did Dalian Workers Learn from the Soviet Union?
　　An Interview with Kang Minzhuang, Delegate from Lüda

　　"How did Dalian workers learn from the Soviet Union?" This is a question everyone wants to know. When the reporter asked Comrade Kang Minzhuang, the delegate from Lüda attending the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference, he replied: "The help from Soviet comrades can be felt in every small matter."

　　From the second half of 1946 to 1947, Dalian was in a very difficult situation due to the Kuomintang's naval and land blockade, and there were two major famines. But at this time, the noble qualities of the workers, who had been ruled by the enemy for forty-two years, were displayed. No matter how hard they were, they would not leave the factory, and no matter how hard they were, they would not stop production. In the hardest times, workers could only eat one meal a day. Sometimes, they only ate a cucumber or a tomato to fill their stomachs. They believed that the Kuomintang's life would not be long, and that they would be able to overcome the difficulties and that life would always be better, because they had the leadership of the Communist Party and the help of Soviet comrades. They tried every means to engage in sideline occupations in addition to production. With the help of the Soviet army, the workers finally overcame the difficulties.

　　During the restoration of production, some workers still held old labor attitudes. Individual workers had theft, loafing on the job, and deceiving the factory due to economic difficulties. Under the leadership of the General Trade Union, education on production, support for the Soviet Union, and the current situation was carried out, and these phenomena quickly changed. In this process, the workers' incorrect understanding of the Soviet Union was gradually overcome!

　　Soviet comrades always maintained a sincere attitude of helping the Chinese people and began to implement various progressive systems in the factories on a trial basis. For example, the seven-grade wage system. At first, everyone could not accept it readily. Later, under the package of this system, including piecework, special awards, and special allocations, the workers were enlightened. Whoever produced more could get more wages and be subject to special awards, special allocations, etc., and they could get everything from grain to daily necessities. A bicycle, which cost more than 20,000 yuan on the market at the time, would be allocated to you at a low price (7,000 to 8,000 yuan) if you made a contribution to production or had significant achievements, and these thousands of yuan would be deducted from your salary over several months. So everyone felt that this system was good.

　　In the past, being an apprentice in a factory in Dalian was considered extremely unlucky. For three years, you would only sweep the floor and fetch water, and you could not hope to learn any technology at all. During the enemy's rule, the vast majority of technical personnel in Dalian were Japanese, and they would not let you learn technology at all. Some technical workers had been working for more than ten years, but they could only read drawings and could not do calculations. In the development of technical learning, a "technical grievance" movement was launched, and the workers complained about the difficulty of not being able to learn technology, which was extremely widespread.

　　After the Soviet comrades came, they were afraid that you would not learn. In the factory, they taught us a method of signing contracts between masters and apprentices. The contract stated that the master guaranteed to teach what within a certain period of time, and the apprentice guaranteed to learn to what extent within a certain period of time. If completed according to the plan, the master could get a certain bonus, and the apprentice could be upgraded. This method guaranteed the workers' technical progress and encouraged their initiative.

　　The workers' views on the Soviet Union have completely changed, so they recalled a series of facts: Lüda was liberated by the Soviet army, the Soviet Union shipped food during the famine, and the leap in technology was due to the Soviet comrades taking the initiative to teach us many valuable experiences and systems. In factories with Soviet technicians, they personally taught the workers.

　　Calculating working hours, wages, reward systems, responsibility systems, tire manufacturing methods… all were taught to us by Soviet comrades.

　　Soviet comrades were very determined to train female technical personnel and female heavy industrial workers, and they gave us many Soviet examples to listen to. At first, many of us did not believe it could be done, but as a result, female drivers, female lathe operators, etc., were all trained under their guidance, and some even became models.

　　In Sino-Soviet joint ventures, there were Soviet comrades as factory directors. For the sake of the future of Chinese industry, they tried to set up deputy factory directors, and some factories set up several. They taught how to manage the factory meticulously. Once a deputy factory director was doing well, the Soviet comrades would promote them to full factory director and let the Chinese comrades manage it themselves.

　　This year, Dalian's "rationalization proposal" movement has been launched more widely. This movement has sharply and universally improved Dalian's production. This is also learning from the Soviet Union and developing with the help of Soviet comrades. We didn't understand at first, and put forward many slogans, asking workers to "invent and create", but the workers thought, "This is a matter for university-graduated engineers. How can we invent and create!" The workers generally lacked confidence. The "rationalization proposal" movement was easier for the workers to accept. Later, Soviet comrades proposed an organized and led "rationalization proposal." The meaning is that for all the problems to be solved in production, the factory leadership should put forward the topics and let everyone think of solutions. The workers were very active and tried their best to think of solutions and make suggestions. As a result, thousands of opinions were raised. Not only inventions and creations, but also many ordinary places that are most easily overlooked were thought of by the workers.

　　The Far East Electric Glass Factory completed the annual task in half a year, and the implementation of rationalization proposals was an important reason. They excitedly wrote a red silk report to Chairman Mao, saying that they had learned from the Soviet Union and that production had increased several times.

　　Now, there is no distance between the workers and citizens of Dalian and the Soviet comrades. In ordinary life, it is full of friendship between the two major nations of China and the Soviet Union. To say it in a small matter: When the Japanese ruled, they regarded the Chinese as cattle and horses and divided the trams into several classes, and the Chinese could only sit in the broken ones. But now, when Soviet comrades are sitting on the tram, if a Chinese woman passes by holding a child, they will immediately stand up and let the Chinese woman sit down. Chinese adults and children now also have such a habit. No force can break this friendship.

　　On the anniversary of the October Revolution, Lüda launched a signature campaign to thank Stalin, and more than 507,000 people signed it. The workers were very serious. If their hands were not clean, they would wash their hands before signing. Many workers did not write well, but because they were writing for Marshal Stalin to see, they were determined to practice writing their names overnight. They always wanted to show their infinite respect for the Soviet Union and Comrade Stalin all at once.

　　大连工人怎样学习苏联？
　　访问旅大代表康敏庄

    “大连工人怎样向苏联学习的？”这是大家都想知道的问题。记者问出席亚澳工会会议的旅大代表康敏庄同志，他回答说：“苏联同志对我们的帮助，在每一件小事情上都可以体会到。”
    一九四六年下半年到四七年，由于国民党海陆的封锁，大连就处于一种非常困难的环境，闹了两次较大的粮荒。可是在这时候，被敌人统治了四十二年的工人，高贵的品质都显示出来了，他们再苦也不离开工厂，再苦也不停止生产。最苦的时候，工人只能一天吃到一顿饭，有时候，他们只吃根黄瓜，或吃个西红柿来顶饭。他们相信国民党的寿命不久长，相信自己能克服困难，生活总会好起来，因为有共产党的领导和苏联同志的帮助。他们想尽各种办法，在生产之外，特地搞副业。在苏军的帮助下，困难终于被工人战胜了。
    在恢复生产中，工人中有些还抱着旧的劳动态度，个别工人因为生活困难，有偷盗的现象，有的有磨洋工和欺骗工厂的现象。在总工会领导下，进行了生产、拥苏和时局的教育，这些现象都很快地转变了。在这一过程中，工人对苏联的一些不正确认识也被逐渐克服了！
    苏联同志始终抱着诚心帮助中国人民的态度，把各种进步的制度开始在工厂试行。比方，七级工资制，起初大家都不能爽快接受，后来在这一制度的包活、计件及特奖、特配下，工人们得到了启发，谁生产的多，就可以得到更多工资和受到特奖、特配等，什么粮食、日用品都可以得到。一辆自行车，当时市价是两万多元，如果你对生产有贡献或有重大成绩，就以低价（七、八千元）配给你，这几千元还给你分好几个月扣除。于是大家都觉得这种制度好。
    过去，在大连的厂子里当学徒，那算倒尽楣了，三年时间，尽是扫地、打水，根本不用希望学技术。敌人统治时，大连的技术人员，绝大多数是日本人，他们根本不让你学到技术，有的技术工人干了十多年，还只会看图纸不会计算。在开展技术学习中，展开了“技术诉苦”运动，工人诉说起学不到技术的苦，那多极了。
    苏联同志来了之后，深怕你不学，在厂子里，他们教会我们一种师傅和学徒的订立合同的办法，合同写明师傅保证在多长时间教会什么，学徒保证多长时间学到什么程度。如按计划完成，师傅可得到一定奖金，学徒即可升级。这一个办法对于工人在技术上的进步有了保障，也鼓励了他们的进取心。
    工人们对苏联的看法，完全改变过来了，于是他们就回想一连串的事实：旅大是苏军解放出来的，粮荒时是苏联运来食粮的，技术飞跃的进步，是由于苏联同志主动的教给我们好些宝贵的经验和制度。有苏联技师的厂子，都亲手把着教工人。
    计算工时、工资、奖励制度、负责制、胎造法，……都是苏联同志教给的。
    培养女技术人材、女重工业工人，苏联同志非常有决心，并举许多苏联例子给我们听。开始时我们很多人还不相信能办到，结果，女司机、女旋盘工等，也都在他们手下培养出来了，有的并成为模范。
    在中苏合营企业里有苏联同志当厂长，他们为着中国工业的前途打算，尽量设副厂长，有的厂子设了好几个。他们对怎样管理工厂，教的无微不至。当一到有某个副厂长当好的时候，苏联同志就将他们提拔为正厂长，让中国同志自己来管理。
    今年，大连的“合理化建议”运动，更广泛的展开了，这一个运动，把大连的生产猛烈地普遍地向上提高。这也是向苏联学习，和在苏联同志帮助下展开的。我们不懂得，开始时，提出很多的口号，要求工人“发明、创造”，但工人认为“这是大学毕业的工程师的事情。我们还能发明、创造！”工人普遍没信心。“合理化建议”运动工人则易接受。后苏联同志又提出有组织，有领导的“合理化建议”。意思就是就生产中所有要解决的问题，由厂的领导上出了题目，让大家想办法解决。工人同志非常积极，都在尽量的想办法，提建议。这一来，意见提到了成千条。不但发明创造，连许多平常最容易忽视的地方，工人们都想到了。
    远东电业玻璃工厂，半年完成全年的任务，实行了合理化建议是重要原因。他们兴奋地给毛主席写了红绸报告书，说他们学习苏联，生产提高了好几倍。
    现在大连的工人、市民和苏联同志没有任何一点隔膜了。在平常生活中，都充满着中苏两大民族的友谊。以一件小事说：日本人统治时，把中国人当成牛马，把电车分成若干等，中国人只能坐破的。而现在，苏联同志坐在电车上，有中国的妇女抱着小孩过去了，他就马上站起来，让中国的妇女坐下，中国的大人、小孩，现在也已经有了这样一个习惯。这种友情没有任何力量能打破了。
    十月革命节，旅大发起了一个签名运动，签名感谢斯大林，签名的就有五十万七千多人。工人们非常认真，见自己的手不干净，非洗了手不去签字。很多工人写字写不好，因为写上去要斯大林大元帅看，就决心连夜地练习写自己的名字。总想一下子就表现出他们对苏联、对斯大林同志是有着无限的敬仰。
