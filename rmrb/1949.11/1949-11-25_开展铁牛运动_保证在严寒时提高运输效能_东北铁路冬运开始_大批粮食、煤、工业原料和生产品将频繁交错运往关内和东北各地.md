　　Launch the Iron Ox Movement
　　Guarantee Improved Transport Efficiency in Severe Cold
　　Northeast Railway Winter Transport Begins
    Large Quantities of Grain, Coal, Industrial Raw Materials, and Manufactured Goods Will Be Frequently Transported Between Guan Nei and Various Parts of the Northeast
    [Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 24th] The heavy winter transport work of the Northeast Railway, after more than three months of preparation, officially began on the 15th of this month according to the new timetable formulated by the Northeast Railway Administration. Large quantities of grain, coal, timber, various industrial raw materials, and industrial products will be frequently transported between Guan Nei and various parts of the Northeast through the day and night efforts of 180,000 railway employees. The winter climate in the Northeast is severely cold, making transportation more difficult than in summer, but railway transportation is particularly busy in winter. After the start of this winter transport, it is necessary not only to prevent train delays in the event of sudden climate changes, but also to further improve railway transport efficiency in order to complete this major task. Therefore, the Northeast Railway Administration began preparations for winter cold protection as early as August this year. Yu Guangsheng, Director of the Administration, Liu Juying, Deputy Director, and other principal responsible cadres have gone to various main lines to conduct inspections and guidance. The Administration has successively convened the Northeast Railway Locomotive Conference and the Northeast Railway Employee Activist Conference to mobilize and organize this winter transport. In addition, a railway technical regulations examination was held for cadres at the level of branch directors of each railway sub-bureau, section chiefs of each railway bureau, and station masters of special-class stations. Other necessary preparations have been made in the areas of car management, locomotive management, civil engineering, telecommunications, materials, management, and personnel. The new winter timetable was formulated by the car management department in close cooperation with the locomotive and civil engineering departments, through bottom-up research. The characteristic of this timetable is that, after overcoming the past tendencies of conservatism and adventurism, it adopts a tense but steady business policy, formulated based on railway technical regulations, transport tasks, and the technical conditions of the Northeast Railway. It is a concentrated expression of the improved work of all departments. According to the provisions of the table, the general driving speed is 70 kilometers per hour; the traction tonnage of each train has also increased by an average of 6.5 percent compared with last year.
    In order to ensure the thorough implementation of the new timetable, in addition to making necessary provisions for the coordination of locomotive, loading and unloading, station services, and operation work, each railway bureau is vigorously carrying out the "Iron Ox Movement" (Note: The Northeast "Iron Ox" locomotive pioneered the record of exceeding two Class A maintenance periods without maintenance and safe driving for more than 100,000 kilometers this year. Other locomotives immediately launched a movement to learn from the Iron Ox locomotive, and the Class A inspection kilometers of many locomotives exceeded 100,000 kilometers.) to give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of employees. In the locomotive management aspect, inspection and repair work has been strengthened and the quality of locomotives has been improved. Seventy percent of the locomotives have been fitted with silk cotton insulation devices. Passenger cars on major trunk lines have also been fitted with double-layer glass and universally equipped with heating equipment, so that passengers do not have to worry about the cold during the journey.
    In terms of civil engineering construction, 16 water towers have been repaired and another 10 are nearing completion. The station buildings destroyed in the past war have also been completely repaired. Apartments have been universally built for crew members at each station, and bedding has been prepared so that crew members can comfortably recover from fatigue. Cargo lines have also been added or extended at major stations; the double track between Xinmin and Siping has been restored; and a connecting line has been opened between Wenguantun in Shenyang and Huanggutun.
    In terms of telecommunications, new text telegraphs have been universally implemented to ensure the speed of communications. The weeding and soil cultivation around the telegraph poles on the line and the oiling of the signals have also been completed. For the convenience of vehicle dispatching, direct dial telephones have been installed between Harbin and Jinzhou and between Harbin and Jiamusi; and an underground line has been added between Changchun and Shenyang.
    In terms of railway trade unions and political work, the political consciousness of workers and staff has been raised and the cultural and recreational life of workers and staff has been enlivened during the Sino-Soviet friendship movement carried out among railway employees. Employee sanatoriums have also been established, security equipment has been inspected, and labor insurance work has been further improved.
    However, due to the insufficient understanding of the significance of cold protection work and complacency on the part of some cadres, winter transport preparations have still suffered some losses. For example, newly made housing and passenger car doors and windows are not tightly closed, some locomotives are not properly kept and cleaned, and the sand removal devices of locomotives are defective. Even individual stations and sections have not completed their tasks at all. After inspection, the Northeast Railway Administration has ordered each bureau to quickly overcome and make up for these deficiencies in the busy work ahead.

　　开展铁牛运动
　　保证在严寒时提高运输效能
　　东北铁路冬运开始
    大批粮食、煤、工业原料和生产品将频繁交错运往关内和东北各地
    【新华社沈阳二十四日电】东北铁路繁重的冬季运输工作，经过三个多月的准备，已按照东北铁路总局制订的新运行表，于本月十五日正式开始。大批的粮食、煤炭、木材、各种工业原料和工业品，将在十八万铁路员工的昼夜努力下，频繁交错地陆续运往关内和东北各地。东北冬季气候严寒，运输较夏季困难，而铁路运输规律则偏于冬季特别繁忙。这次冬季运输开始后，不仅要在气候突变的情况下不使列车晚点，还要进一步提高铁路运输效能，以期完成此一重大的任务。因此，东北铁路总局早在今年八月间即开始了冬季防寒的准备工作。总局长余光生、副局长刘巨英等各主要负责干部，均曾分头到各主要干线进行检查和指导，并先后由总局召开过东北铁路机务会议和全东北铁路员工的活动分子大会，为这一冬季运输进行动员和组织的工作，此外，还举行过一次对各铁路分局分局长、各铁路局各处处长、特等站长一级干部的铁路技术规程考试。其他如车务、机务、工务、电务、材料、经理、人事等工作方面都作了必要的准备工作。冬季新运行表，是由车务方面，在机务、工务等部门的密切合作下，经过由下而上的研究而制订的。这一运行表的特点，是在克服了过去的保守主义和冒险主义偏向之后，采取了紧张而又稳健的业务方针，根据铁路技术规程、运输任务和东北铁路的技术条件而制定的。它是各部门工作提高一步的集中表现。根据该表的规定，一般行车速度为每小时七十公里；每列车的牵引吨数也比去年平均数增加了百分之六点五。
    为了保证新运行表的彻底实现，各铁路局除在机车、装卸、站务、运转等工作的配合上作了必要规定外，并正大力开展“铁牛运动”（按：东北“铁牛”号机车曾于今年首创超过两个甲种检修期没有检修，安全行车十万公里以上的纪录。其他机车立即展开了向铁牛号看齐的运动，许多机车的甲检公里都超过了十万公里。），以发挥员工的积极性和创造精神。在机务方面，则加强了检查修理工作，提高了机车质量。百分之七十的机车已按装了丝棉保温装置。各主要干线上的客车亦都装上了双层玻璃，并普遍装置了暖气设备，使旅客不用耽心旅途中的寒冷。
    在工务建筑方面，已修复的水塔即有十六个，另有十个即将完工。在过去战争中被破坏了的站舍亦已全部修复。各站普遍为乘务员修建了公寓，准备了被褥，使乘务员得以安适地恢复疲劳。各主要车站也都增设或延长了货物线；从新民到四平间的复线已经恢复；沈阳文官屯到皇姑屯间则开辟了连络线。
    在电务方面，为了保证通讯的迅速，均普遍实行了新文字电报。线路上电杆周围的除草培土和号志的涂油工作亦已全部完成。为了车辆调度上的便利，哈尔滨至锦州和哈尔滨至佳木斯间都装置了直通电话；长春至沈阳间也增设了地下线。
    铁路工会和政治工作方面，则于铁路员工开展的中苏友好运动中，提高了工人和职员的政治觉悟，活跃了工人和职员的文化娱乐生活。员工疗养院亦已成立，保安设备亦已检查；劳动保险工作已更加健全。
    但是由于一部分干部对于防寒工作的意义认识不够和有自满情绪，冬运准备工作仍受到一些损失。如新做的住房和客车门窗关不紧，部分机车保管擦洗不好，机车撤沙装置不良等。甚至有个别站、段还根本没有完成任务。东北铁路总局于检查后，已饬令各局在今后繁忙的工作中，迅速加以克服和弥补。
