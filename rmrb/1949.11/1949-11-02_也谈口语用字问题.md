　　Also Discussing the Issue of Words Used in Spoken Language
    Lin Xi
    New people's literature can be written in spoken language, should be written in spoken language, and should not be prevented from being written in spoken language simply because there is no such character in the square Chinese characters, or because such a meaning cannot be found in the square character dictionaries or etymological dictionaries.
    If only those characters with explanations found in the Kangxi Dictionary or the Etymological Dictionary are allowed to be used to write literature, not to mention new literature, even Yuan operas, Water Margin, Golden Lotus, and Dream of the Red Chamber could not be written. This is because these authors wrote many "incorrect" characters for which the explanation could not be found not only in the Kangxi Dictionary and the Etymological Dictionary, but even in Shuowen Jiezi and Guangyun.
    Since it is admitted that "there is no problem with using spoken language for mass literature," why insist that those who write new literature search for "correct characters" in the Kangxi Dictionary? This is like putting three-inch embroidered shoes on naturally large feet. How can it be said that "拨落 (bō luò)," "亚赛 (yà sài)," and "孤 (gū)" are necessarily "correct characters," while "巴拉 (bā lā)," "厌赛 (yàn sài)," and "鼓 (gǔ)" are necessarily incorrect or wrong characters? Aren't you very supportive of writing in spoken language? Why do you嫌嫌 (xián xián - dislike) the characters that more accurately convey the sound of spoken language, deeming them incorrect? "没落 (mò luò)" is a new word and should be read as Mùluò (Mulo), without the retroflex "儿 (er)" sound of "梅酪 (méi lào)". "角落 (jiǎo luò)" (according to the "correct" pronunciation of its square Chinese characters, it is Gyoluo.) is nonsense. I have never heard any living person in any dialect area say it like that now. In Beijing dialect it is pronounced Gālá, and in standard Northern Mandarin it seems to be Gēlo. It is perfectly acceptable to write it as "嘎拉儿 (gā lā er)" or "格咯 (gé gē)" using square Chinese characters. It is also possible to write it as "角落 (jiǎo luò)", but it must be noted that it is pronounced Gēlo.
    However, I also do not agree with creating new Chinese characters for the sake of writing in spoken language. "擤 (xǐng)" is fundamentally a later-created ideogram. The pronunciation in the Etymological Dictionary is "亨上声 (hēng shǎng shēng)". It does not conform to modern spoken language, and it has many strokes, so it should be abolished. Writing it as "醒 (xǐng)" is very natural and readily available. And more of the masses will recognize it, why resist being considered "stubbornly clinging to one's own views"!
    To discuss the issue of using words in spoken language, the fundamental contradiction lies in the fact that square Chinese characters are not suitable for writing modern Chinese spoken language. The complete resolution of the contradiction lies in only one path, which is to use the Latinized New Writing System to write new literature. Before the New Writing System can be implemented, it is still possible to reluctantly use square Chinese characters to write the people's spoken language, but one should try to choose characters that are relatively commonly used, close in sound, have few strokes, and whose meaning is not likely to cause misunderstanding. Do not move old characters, find correct characters, or create new characters, and throw more random rocks onto the already heavy burden of square Chinese characters that the people are carrying. Let square Chinese characters move more smoothly towards simplification and phoneticization.

　　也谈口语用字问题
    林曦
    新的人民文艺可以用口语来写，应该用口语来写，而且不能因为方块汉字里没有那么一个字儿，方块字的字典、辞源里查不出那么一个意思，就不用口语来写。
    一定要康熙字典、辞源里有了那么一种解释的字儿才准用来写文艺的话，不要说新文艺，连元曲、水浒、金瓶梅、红楼梦都一齐写不出来了。因为这些作者都写了不少不光是康熙字典、辞源，甚至连说文、广韵也都查不出那个解释来的白字。
    既然承认“大众文艺用口语写不成问题”，却偏要让写新文艺的人翻康熙字典去找什么“正字”；这是往天足上套三寸绣花小鞋儿。何以见得“拨落”、“亚赛”、“孤”……就一定是“正字”，而“巴拉”、“厌赛”、“鼓”……就一定是偏字，是别字？您不是很赞成写口语吗？为什么更准确地传出口语的声音的字儿，却又嫌他不正了？“没落”是新词儿，应读作Ｍｕｌｏ，根本没有“梅酪”带卷舌“儿”的音。“角落”（照它方块汉字的“正”音是Ｇｙｏｌｕｏ。）是鬼话，恕我不曾听过哪一个方言区的活人现在还这么说着。北京话作Ｇａｌａｒ，北方普通话似乎是Ｇｅｌｏ，用方块汉字来写成“嘎拉儿”，“格咯”，都无不可。一定要写“角落”，也是可以的，只是必须注明读作Ｇｅｌｏ。
    只是，我也不赞成：为写口语，生造新的汉字。“擤”，根本是后造的会意字，辞源的注音是“亨上声”。不合现代口语，笔画又多，该废掉不用。写作“醒”，很自然，很现成。又多几个大众认得了，何防“师心自用”！
    要谈口语用字问题，根本的矛盾就在于：方块汉字不能适合于写出现代中国人的口语。矛盾的彻底解决只有一条道路，那就是用拼音的拉丁化新文字来写新文艺。在新文字没能推行以前，勉强用方块汉字来写人民的口语还是可以的，不过要尽量选用比较常用的，声音切近、笔画简少，而意义又不致引起误会的字。不要搬古字、找正字、造生字，给已经压得人民大众够沉重的方块汉字的担子上，再扔进乱石块去。让方块汉字更顺利地走向简单化、标音化的道路吧。
