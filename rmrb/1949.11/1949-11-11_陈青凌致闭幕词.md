    Chen Qingling Delivers Closing Address
    [Beijing News] The Chinese Labor Association Representative Conference closed today. Labor Association Representative Chen Qingling delivered the closing address. The full text is as follows:
    Chairman, Respected Leaders, Comrades:
    The Chinese Labor Association Representative Conference, under the direct guidance of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and after six days of efforts by the representatives, has victoriously concluded today.
    The representatives attending this conference came from various regions with Labor Association organizations, representing the common will of all Labor Association members. At this conference, we summarized the work of the Labor Association over the past dozen years, adopted the resolution to terminate the Labor Association's organization, and pointed out the direction and tasks for Labor Association members' future work. These decisions are supported by all Labor Association members and are in line with the interests of the national working class.
    Although the Labor Association, during the past reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, waged a long period of arduous struggle to fight for democracy, protect the interests of workers, and maintain the unity of the national working class, writing a glorious page in the history of the Chinese workers' movement, the era of using the Labor Association organization to fight for the interests of the Chinese working class has passed. Now is a new era. The Chinese working class has stood up, as Chairman Mao said: "The Chinese people have stood up." The People's Republic of China has been born, and the Central People's Government has been established. With the birth of the New China, a high tide of economic construction will inevitably follow. In order to welcome this high tide of economic construction, and to further develop the strength of the working class to undertake this huge task, the national working class must be unified under the leadership of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and organized according to the industrial system. The organizational form of the Labor Association is not suitable for the new requirements. Therefore, it is very correct that all representatives today unanimously passed a resolution: "Announcing the termination of the Labor Association organization." It is also particularly beneficial to the cause of Chinese workers' unity.
    Under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we firmly believe that the revolutionary cause of the Chinese working class is infinitely bright and its future development is limitless. Labor Association members will, in the future, under the leadership of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, share the tasks of building the New China. The responsibilities of future undertakings are very arduous, and our abilities are far from enough. We must learn with an open mind, sincerely learn from advanced comrades, work honestly, and always follow the Chinese Communist Party in order to contribute our strength to the cause of building the New China.
    At this conference, we heard the speeches of Comrade Liu Shaoqi, Honorary Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Vice Chairman Li, and Vice Chairman Liu, which gave us many instructions and encouragement, helped us understand the current situation, and raised our thinking a step further. I would like to express my gratitude and respect to them on behalf of this conference.
    Since the Chinese working class has had the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, it has had a bright future. As an organization of the Chinese working class, the Chinese Labor Association is the same. For more than a dozen years, the Labor Association has developed and progressed under the leadership and assistance of the great Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. Without this leadership and assistance, the Labor Association would not have the glorious ending it has today. We would like to pay the highest respect to the great Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. We will resolutely unite under the banner of Mao Zedong, and humbly learn from the Soviet Union's experience in national construction, and strive to complete the New Democratic construction of the New China, to advance China towards the path of socialism, and to defend world peace. We shout:
    Long live the great unity of the Chinese working class!
    Long live the People's Republic of China!
    Long live the Chinese Communist Party!
    Long live Chairman Mao!

    陈青凌致闭幕词
    【北京讯】中国劳动协会代表会议今日闭幕，劳协代表陈青凌致闭幕词，全文如下：
    主席、各位首长、各位同志：
    中国劳动协会代表会议，在中华全国总工会直接指导之下，经过各代表六日来的努力，今天胜利地闭幕了。
    出席这次会议的代表，来自各地区有劳协组织的地方，代表了劳协全体会员的共同意志，在这次会议上，我们总结了劳协过去十几年来的工作，通过了劳协机构结束的决议，指出劳协会员今后工作的方向与任务，这些决定，是劳协全体会员所拥护的，是符合于全国工人阶级的利益的。
    虽然劳协在过去国民党反动统治时期，为争取民主，为保护工人利益，为保持全国工人阶级的团结，作了长时期的艰苦斗争，在中国工运史上，写下了光荣的一页。但运用劳协机构为中国工人阶级利益而斗争的时代过去了。现在是一个新时代，中国工人阶级已经翻了身，诚如毛主席所说的：“中国人民已经站起来了”。中华人民共和国已经诞生，中央人民政府已经成立。随着新中国的诞生，经济建设的高潮，必然随伴而来，为了迎接这个经济建设的高潮，为了更高的发扬工人阶级的力量，以担负起这一巨大的任务，全国工人阶级必须统一在中华全国总工会领导之下，按产业系统，组织起来。劳协的组织方式，不适合于新的要求，所以今天全体代表一致通过决议：“宣布劳协机构的结束”，是很正确的事。也特别有利于中国工人的团结事业。
    在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，我们坚决相信，中国工人阶级的革命事业，光芒万丈，前途发展无限，劳协会员，今后在中华全国总工会领导之下，分担新中国建设的任务。未来事业的责任很艰巨，我们的能力很不够，我们要虚心学习，诚心诚意向先进的同志学习，老老实实的工作，永远跟着中国共产党走，以求在新中国建设事业上，贡献我们的力量。
    在这次会议上，我们听到了我们中华全国总工会名誉主席刘少奇同志、李副主席、和刘副主席的讲话，给予我们很多的指示和鼓励，帮助我们对目前形势的认识，把我们的思想提高了一步，我谨代表本会议，向他们致谢致敬。
    中国工人阶级，自从有了中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导，就有了光明的前途，作为中国工人阶级的一个组织，中国劳动协会也是一样，十几年来，劳协都是在伟大的中国共产党和毛主席的领导、帮助下而发展、而进步的，没有这种领导帮助，劳协便不会有今天光荣的结束，我们要向伟大的中国共产党和毛主席致崇高的敬礼，我们坚决团结在毛泽东的旗帜下，并虚心向苏联学习建国经验，为完成新中国新民主主义的建设，为使中国向社会主义之途迈进，为保卫世界长久和平而努力奋斗。我们高呼：
    中国工人阶级大团结万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
