(Beijing News) At the second meeting of the Second Beijing Municipal People's Congress, representatives discussed Mayor Nie's government work report and the future guidelines and plans for Beijing. The representatives spoke enthusiastically, unanimously expressing their complete agreement and pledging to assist the municipal government in its efforts to realize the municipal construction guidelines and plans. The main points of the representatives' speeches are as follows:

　　　　Gu Qizong

Student Representative Gu Qizong: Our student delegation discussed Mayor Nie's report and felt very satisfied. Most of the 171 proposals have been implemented by the government in the past three months, which makes us very satisfied. The future work guidelines and plans are entirely aimed at the needs of the current work, and we enthusiastically support them.

　　　　Guan Zongyin

Farmer Representative Guan Zongyin: I am a farmer representative from Bagou Administrative Village in the 16th District. I am very happy to be able to attend this meeting today. The election of the Mayor of Beijing by the people is a manifestation of the thorough implementation of democracy. The government's willingness to listen to our opinions shows its concern for the people. I call on everyone to go back and report to the masses, study hard, develop industry and commerce, do a good job in production, and move forward under the leadership of Chairman Mao!

　　　　Yan Jici

Faculty and Staff Representative Yan Jici: I represent the faculty and staff of various universities and colleges in Beijing. I am very satisfied with Mayor Nie's report. Whether it is in public security, finance and economics, culture and education, or health work, especially in strengthening the study of workers' children and curriculum reform, I am satisfied even under the existing difficult conditions.

　　　　Chen Mingde

Journalist Representative Chen Mingde: I strongly support Mayor Nie's report. In the development of cultural and educational undertakings, nearly 30,000 out-of-school adults and children have been given the opportunity to receive education. Such a huge achievement in two months is precisely what Chairman Mao pointed out as an inevitable upsurge in cultural construction. This upsurge has emerged in the people's capital.

　　　　Fan Hong

Democratic Professor Fan Hong: I sincerely endorse Mayor Nie's report, and I feel that the democratic atmosphere of this conference is even stronger than the last one, because the number of people has increased compared with the last time, the number of representative units has also increased, and the election of the mayor and deputy mayor by the people is something that has never happened in many years. In the policy report, I am also very satisfied with the work in cultural and educational aspects, such as strengthening worker education and building cultural institutions, but I also hope that adult education can be further strengthened in the future, so that the people of Beijing can improve themselves and develop new democratic education in their spare time.

　　　　Song Fengxiang

Worker Representative Song Fengxiang: I am very satisfied with the important tasks proposed in Mayor Nie's work report, such as consolidating revolutionary order, restoring and developing production, and carrying out cultural and educational undertakings.

　　　　Yang Kaiwen

Worker Representative Yang Kaiwen: We must cooperate with the government's work guidelines to complete our own work tasks. For the long-term interests of the People's Republic of China, we must work hard to succeed. This task may be very arduous, but we must overcome difficulties to complete the task of building the people's capital.

　　　　Zhuang Zhihui

Youth Representative Zhuang Zhihui: The city's youth are carrying out voluntary labor, which shows that today's Beijing belongs to our people. We must resolutely implement the resolutions of the People's Congress and be masters of our own affairs.

　　　　Zhang Shuzhen

Farmer Representative Zhang Shuzhen: I strongly support Mayor Nie's report. After I go back, I will unite the whole village to overthrow the landlords, participate in productive labor even better, grow more food, and never forget the benefits of Chairman Mao and the People's Liberation Army.

　　　　Wen Jiasi

Representative of the Beijing Branch of the China Democratic League, Wen Jiasi: In three months, Beijing's construction work has achieved such great achievements. We should not only pay high tribute to the government leaders and staff, but also express our deep gratitude. Beijing's construction work is already moving forward. At this representative meeting, the Beijing Municipal People's Government will be elected. The progress of this election is a concrete manifestation that Beijing's construction work is progressing smoothly.

　　　　Ma Yuhuai

Hui Representative Ma Yuhuai: In discussing Mayor Nie's report, our ethnic minority representatives unanimously believe that the policy of national equality, unity, and mutual assistance has been further realized. In the past few months, the municipal government has given possible consideration and appropriate handling to the interests of various ethnic minorities and certain disputes between ethnic groups, and achieved the goal of unity. In the future, only when all ethnic groups unite can ethnic minorities have the possibility of development. In the past few months, the Beijing Municipal Government has helped us with the spirit of equality and mutual assistance and implemented such policies. Therefore, we support Mayor Nie's entire report.

　　　　Zhang Yunchuan

Representative of the Beijing Municipal Party Consolidation Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, Zhang Yunchuan: After listening to Mayor Nie's report, checking and verifying the past work, it can be said that it is completely in line. Every resolution of the first meeting has a positive factual response. We are very impressed and grateful for the pragmatic and responsible spirit of the municipal government leaders. After the meeting, we must follow the 2 million citizens of Beijing and work hard to build a new Beijing.

　　　　Xu Zhushi

Industrial and Commercial Representative Xu Zhushi: I am very satisfied with Mayor Nie's report, especially the third item on cultural and educational work. In order to develop production, I hope the government will set up more vocational schools to train technical personnel and improve technical standards.

　　　　Wang Biao

Representative of the Beijing Branch of the China National Democratic Construction Association, Wang Biao: The resolution of the first representative meeting has been implemented by 94%, which shows the efficiency of the government and the serious efforts of the staff. Stabilizing prices is extremely necessary. I hope effective measures will be taken, and I ask all representatives to pay more attention to research and solutions.

　　　　Zeng Zhaoyi

Representative of the Municipal Women's Federation, Zeng Zhaoyi: We wholeheartedly support the government's policies, and we are very satisfied with the work done by the government during these short three months. We especially support all the government's measures regarding tax collection, because our taxes are taken from the people and used for the people. In the future, it is needless to say that money must be used to build a new Beijing. I hope all representatives will go back and carry out propaganda to assist the government in successfully completing the tax collection work.

　　　　Lian Kuoru

Representative of the Quyi Circle, Lian Kuoru: The government has done a very good job in cleaning up counter-revolutionaries and rectifying garbage on large and small streets, as resolved by the first representative meeting. I, on behalf of 2,800 people in the Quyi circle, sincerely support Mayor Nie's report. Now the Public Security Bureau is conducting household registration. Our representatives must play an exemplary role and mobilize people to register truthfully to consolidate the security of our people's capital.

　　　　Xu Chubo

Representative of the Teachers' Union of Primary and Secondary Schools, Xu Chubo: In two and a half months, and under difficult circumstances of manpower and material resources, the municipal government has completed the resolutions of the previous representative meeting, which cannot but make people sincerely grateful and admired. We wholeheartedly support this representative meeting exercising the functions and powers of the People's Congress.

　　　　Guo Caizhang

Worker Representative Guo Caizhang: We must transform prostitutes so that they have a labor perspective and participate in production. Otherwise, they will endanger national health and affect social security.

　　　　Cao Jianrong

Farmer Representative Cao Jianrong: The work done by the government in the past two months is entirely implementing the first All-Circles Representative Conference, and we farmers absolutely support Mayor Nie's report. At present, the lives of farmers in the suburbs are difficult. We must organize winter sideline production to overcome difficulties.

　　　　Sun Zhengmin

Farmer Representative Sun Zhengmin: The government has made significant achievements in implementing the resolutions of the first representative meeting, such as suppressing counter-revolutionary elements and eliminating bandits. Now robbery and theft in the suburbs have been greatly reduced. The government has accepted the demands of farmers to give due punishment to local tyrants and evil gentry in the suburbs. This year, the government provided loans for seeds for wheat planting to help farmers solve difficulties. We farmers must work hard to do a good job in production. Mayor Nie's policy report is in line with the interests of farmers, and we will go back and mobilize all farmers to thoroughly implement this policy.

　　　　Qian Weichang

Democratic Professor Qian Weichang: I speak on behalf of several representatives from Tsinghua University: Zhang Xiruo, Liang Sicheng, Ye Qisun, Qian Sanqiang, Ma John, Fei Xiaotong, Hu Yuanling, etc. The government's past attention to municipal construction is completely correct. We fully accept Mayor Nie's report and are unconditionally willing to resolutely carry out the construction of the people's capital under the leadership of the People's Government. The municipal construction policy put forward by the municipal government is indeed an urgent task for the city at present. I hope everyone will pay attention to the fact that the proposed tap water, sewers, environmental sanitation, and work-for-relief are all local problems. In the future, there will inevitably be a comprehensive political, economic, cultural, and all-round construction plan for municipal construction, with the goal of increasing the welfare of every citizen, so that our capital can be developed gradually in a planned and orderly manner.

　　　　Liu Wanfu

Farmer Representative Liu Wanfu: The local tyrants, evil gentry, and hooligans in the suburbs have been largely eliminated. The municipal government has done a lot for us and does not waste a single catty of millet. We farmers firmly support Mayor Nie's report.

　　　　Liu Zhendong

Worker Representative Liu Zhendong: We workers of the water company support Mayor Nie's report. Tap water should be nationalized. I will go back and explain to my fellow workers who the tap water is serving, ensure that citizens have water to drink and use, and improve technical standards to make the water cleaner.

　　　　Li Yuku

Worker Representative Li Yuku: I represent the construction workers in supporting Mayor Nie's report. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, we will work hard to produce and strive to build the people's capital.

　　　　Luo Guizhen

Medical Worker Luo Guizhen: We medical workers support Mayor Nie's report, especially in the fields of culture, education, and health. Dredging sewers and improving environmental sanitation are basic tasks to protect people's health. We are willing to work hard under the leadership of Chairman Mao to enhance the health of the Chinese people.

　　　　Zhang Dazhong

Zhang Dazhong of the Municipal Youth League Working Committee: We fully agree with Mayor Nie's report. The Youth League representatives are particularly concerned and satisfied with Mayor Nie's report on restoring and developing production and developing education and cultural undertakings. Because Chairman Mao gave the Youth League instructions: Our main task is to work hard to study and develop production. In the future, we will work with the city's youth and the city's people to do our best to implement the resolutions of the conference!

　　　　Wu Jiwen

Yan University School Doctor Wu Jiwen: I support Mayor Nie's report. The prostitute problem is a serious social problem, and I hope it can be solved quickly and well.

　　　　Zhou Fanwen

Representative of the Beijing Branch of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang, Zhou Fanwen: The resolutions of the previous meeting were implemented by 94%, which shows how faithfully the municipal government serves the people. Mayor Nie's municipal report and the proposed future policies are completely correct. We sincerely support them and will take action to assist in the implementation of these policies. This meeting exercises the functions and powers of the People's Congress and elects the mayor, which is the first time in Chinese history. This is the result of the success of the people's revolution. This is true people's democracy. These are all victories achieved under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China.

　　　　Li Shumin

Worker Representative Li Shumin: The municipal government has done a lot for us workers based on the resolutions of the last meeting, such as workers' out-of-school children having schools to attend. We workers can only support Mayor Nie's report with practical actions to develop production.

　　　　Qiu Fangyu

Worker Representative Qiu Fangyu: We fully support Mayor Nie's report to us. The first meeting solved many difficulties for us workers under the condition of very scarce manpower and material resources and took care of all aspects of our lives. After the meeting, we must work harder to develop production and savings, and further launch a production competition to give full play to a hundred times the active and creative spirit to build the people's capital.

　　　　Wang Wenbin

Worker Representative Wang Wenbin: I was promoted from worker to Deputy Director of Shijingshan Power Plant. The No. 6 generator broke down. Our factory should review and be responsible, but during the repair period, all the workers in the plant worked hard to supply electricity to the capital. The people did not have the lights go out, indicating that public utilities should be state-owned, so we workers agree that tap water should be changed to state-owned.

　　　　Luo Wenfang

Luo Wenfang of the Public Security Corps: Our Public Security Corps fully agrees and firmly supports Mayor Nie's report. In the future, the Public Security Corps will not only further consolidate the revolutionary order, but also participate in production and become a large army for production and construction.
