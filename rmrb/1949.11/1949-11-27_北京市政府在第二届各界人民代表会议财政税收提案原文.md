[Beijing News] The financial and tax proposals submitted by the Beijing Municipal People's Government to the Second Session of the People's Representative Conference were unanimously adopted by the conference. The resolutions are as follows:

　　(1) Resolution on the Unified Collection of Income Tax and Business Tax on Profit-Making Enterprises

　　The income tax on profit-making enterprises for the first half of 1949 should be combined with the summer business tax collection, and it is stipulated that each share should be levied at twelve jin of millet. The method of determining the burden share will be a combination of investigation and democratic assessment. The reasons are:

　　In order to simplify the tax system, the current business license tax, interest income tax, and special business tax in this city should be abolished; the income tax on profit-making enterprises should be combined with the summer business tax collection. The principles for determining the tax rate are: industry should be lighter than commerce; manufacturing of production tools such as machinery should be lighter than ordinary consumer goods manufacturing; manufacturing of necessities should be lighter than manufacturing of non-essential goods; and tax reductions should be granted to manufacturing that can replace imported necessities and export commodities.

　　Currently, most industrial and commercial enterprises do not have a complete accounting system to serve as a basis for taxation. Based on past experience, general industrial and commercial enterprises believe that the method of combining investigation and democratic assessment is relatively fair, reasonable, and practical.

　　Based on the survey of the business conditions of industrial and commercial enterprises in the first half of this year, it is specifically stipulated that each share should be levied at twelve jin of millet. The methods are:

　　(1) In accordance with the above spirit, formulate "Interim Measures for the Collection of Income Tax and Business Tax on Profit-Making Enterprises."

　　(2) During the assessment, the total scores of the income tax on profit-making enterprises in the second half of 1948 will still be used as the basis for each industry in the urban area, and appropriate adjustments will be made for changes in business conditions and unreasonable previous assessments.

　　(3) All public and private enterprises shall pay taxes to the municipal government in accordance with this unified tax rule.

　　(4) It is estimated that 27.6 million jin of millet can be collected from industrial and commercial enterprises and public enterprises in the city and suburbs (only including municipal and agency-operated enterprises; enterprises under the North China system also pay taxes to the municipal tax bureau in a unified manner; the amount of tax payable has not been included).

　　(5) The "Industrial and Commercial Tax Collection Promotion Committee" will still be organized according to the previous tax collection method, but in order to further promote democracy, more representatives of industrial and commercial enterprises and other people's organizations should be invited to participate and be responsible for promoting the collection and assessment and adjustment of industry scores.

　　(6) Industrial and commercial households with a tax payable of less than one share are exempt from taxation.

　　(2) Resolution on the Collection of Fixed-Amount Property Tax

　　In order to facilitate payment by citizens, the property tax in this city is proposed to be collected at a fixed amount. The reasons are:

　　(1) To simplify tax procedures and make it easier for citizens to understand the amount of tax they should bear, it is proposed to calculate and collect the tax at a fixed amount.

　　(2) After the property tax is collected, the old house donation will be abolished.

　　(3) In the past, the tax payable for self-occupied houses was six-tenths of that of rented houses. In order to alleviate and prevent the housing shortage in the capital and encourage house rentals, it is decided to increase the property tax for self-occupied houses from the original six-tenths of the tax payable for rented houses to eight-tenths.

　　(4) Public and private houses shall pay taxes in accordance with the regulations.

　　(5) Calculated according to the above-mentioned fixed tax amount method, the property tax should collect a total of 4 million to 4.5 million jin of millet per quarter.

　　(3) Resolution on the Collection of Fixed-Amount Land Tax

　　In order to facilitate payment by citizens, the land tax in this city is proposed to be collected at a fixed amount. The reasons are:

　　(1) Land tax is a type of property tax, which plays an important role in ensuring the rational use of urban land.

　　(2) In the future, the land tax in this city will be collected according to the fixed amount attached. For all land exceeding one standard mu, it is proposed to calculate and collect the tax on a progressive basis. In this way, on the one hand, the government's tax revenue can be guaranteed, and on the other hand, taxpayers can predict their own tax payable. It is estimated that 8.5 million jin of millet can be collected annually.

　　(4) Resolution on the Collection of Progressive Agricultural Tax

　　Based on the annual agricultural land yield and the burden-bearing capacity of farmers in the suburbs of this city, it is stipulated that a total of 26 million jin of millet will be collected for progressive agricultural tax this year, and according to the disaster situation in the suburbs of Beijing, 4 million jin of millet will be reduced or exempted separately according to specific circumstances. The reasons are:

　　After investigation and research, the results of the estimation are that the average annual yield per mu of farmland, garden land, paddy fields, and dry land in the suburbs is about one shi and four dou and six sheng of corn. According to the conversion of nine market dou of corn to one standard mu, the entire suburbs should have a total of 1,692,615 standard mu. After deducting one standard mu exempt from tax per capita for the 517,000 agricultural population in the entire suburbs, about 26 million jin of millet should be borne. This year, there are partial disasters in the suburbs. According to actual investigations, more than 97,000 mu have no harvest at all, and according to the unified regulations of North China, all burdens should be exempted. About 100,000 mu have a harvest that is 30% less than the normal yield, and the burden reduction is 20%. About 147,000 mu have a harvest that is 50% less than the normal yield, and the burden reduction is 60%. In order to take care of the farmers' burden and take into account the government's fiscal revenue, it is specifically decided to reduce or exempt 4 million jin of millet. Methods:

　　Collected twice according to the ratio of two-thirds in autumn and one-third in summer, that is, about two-thirds of the tax will be collected this autumn, and one-third will be collected in the wheat harvest next year. Farmers who have no summer harvest will collect all at once.

　　(5) Resolution on the Additional Levy of Primary School Education Fees and Sanitation Fees with Property Tax, Land Tax, Income Tax on Profit-Making Enterprises, and Business Tax

　　Municipal primary school education fees and sanitation fees are local expenditures and should be temporarily collected together with property tax, land tax, income tax on profit-making enterprises, and business tax. The reasons are:

　　Primary school education fees and sanitation fees originally belonged to local expenditures. Since liberation, this city has collected local administrative business fees twice. At that time, because the old autonomous donation collection method was used, it formed a household-by-household apportionment, which was very unreasonable. Therefore, the municipal government decided to suspend the collection in May, but the above-mentioned two fees are necessary expenditures for this city, and their annual expenditures are:

　　(1) Primary school education fees: The number of teachers and staff in primary schools in the urban area is 2,729 (there are currently 2,598, plus 5% for reserves), and the monthly expenditure for salaries and public miscellaneous expenses is about 892,305 jin, and the annual requirement is about 10,707,660 jin.

　　(2) Street sanitation fees (sweeper wages, etc.): require about 10,054,950 jin per year.

　　The above two items total about 20,762,610 jin per year. According to the practice of various cities and the current implementation, this expenditure should be raised by the local government according to local conditions. Methods:

　　Based on the above situation, it is decided to solve the problem by means of an additional levy. 30% will be levied additionally for property tax and land tax, and 10% will be levied additionally for income tax and business tax. The additional tax belonging to the suburbs should be used as the primary school funding in the suburbs.

　　北京市政府在第二届各界人民代表会议财政税收提案原文
    【北京讯】北京市人民政府向第二届各界人民代表会议所提出的财政税收提案，经大会一致通过，决议如下：
    （一）关于统一征收营利事业所得税和营业税的决议
    一九四九年上半年营利事业所得税，应与夏季营业税合并征收，并规定每分共征十二斤小米，负担分数之拟定，拟采用调查与民主评定相结合之方法。理由：
    为简化税制，应将本市现行之营业牌照税、利息所得税及特种营业税废止；将营利事业所得税与夏季营业税合并征收。税率拟定之原则，按工业轻于商业；机器等生产工具制造业，轻于普通生活资料制造业；必须品制造业，轻于非必需品制造业；并对于能够代替舶来必需品和输出商品的制造业，予以减税待遇。
    目前多数工商业户，尚无完备之会计制度，足为征税依据。根据以往经验，一般工商业户均认为调查与民主评定相结合之方法，比较公平合理，切实可行。
    根据本年上半年工商业营业状况之调查，特规定每分按十二斤小米征收。办法：
    （一）根据以上精神，制定“营利事业所得税及营业税征收暂行办法”。
    （二）评议时，城区各行业仍以一九四八年下半年营利事业所得税之总分数为基础，其营业情况变更及以前评议有不合理者，加以适当调整。
    （三）一切公营企业与私营企业，均按此统一税则向市政府纳税。
    （四）城内、郊区工商业及公营企业（只包括市营及机关经营之企业在内，华北系统之企业亦统一向本市税局纳税，其应纳税额尚未计入）预计可征收小米二千七百六十万斤。
    （五）仍依照上次征税办法，组织“工商业税征收推进委员会”，但为更广泛发扬民主，应再增聘工商业代表和其他人民团体代表若干人参加，负责推动征收及行业分数之评议调整。
    （六）工商业户纳税额不及一分者免征。
    （二）关于征收定额房产税的决议
    为便利市民缴纳，本市房产税拟按定额征收。其理由，为：
    （一）简化税收手续，并使市民易于了解自己应负之税额，拟按定额计征。
    （二）房产税征收后，旧房捐一律取消。
    （三）过去自住房屋之纳税额为出租房屋的十分之六，兹为减轻与防止首都房荒，鼓励房屋出租，决定将自住房屋之房产税从原来的占出租房屋纳税额的十分之六提高为十分之八。
    （四）公私房屋一律照章纳税。
    （五）依照上项固定税额办法计征，房产税每季共应征小米四百万到四百五十万斤。
    （三）关于征收定额地产税的决议
    为便利市民缴纳，本市地产税拟按定额征收。其理由，为：
    （一）地产税为财产税之一种，对于保证城市土地之合理地使用，有重要作用。
    （二）今后本市地产税，按附列定额征收。对于超过一标准亩之所有土地，拟按累进计征。这样，一方面可以保证政府的税收，一方面可使纳税人预知自己的应负税额。计每年可征小米八百五十万斤。
    （四）关于征收农业累进税的决议
    根据本市郊区常年农地产量及农民负担能力，规定本年共征收农业累进税两千六百万斤小米。并根据京郊灾情，按具体情况，分别减免四百万斤小米案。理由：
    经过调查研究，推算结果，郊区农地园田、稻田、水田、旱田，平均每亩常年产量约为一石四斗六升玉米，按玉米九市斗折合一个标准亩，全郊区共计当有一百六十九万二千六百一十五标准亩。全郊区五十一万七千农业人口每人除免税一标准亩外，共应负担约二千六百万斤小米。今年郊区有部分灾情。根据实际调查，全无收成者九万七千余亩，按华北统一规定，当全部免除负担，较常年产量歉收三成者约十万亩，减免负担额百分之二十，较常年产量歉收五成者，约十四万七千余亩，减免负担额百分之六十。为照顾农民负担并兼顾政府财政收入，特决定减免四百万斤小米。办法：
    按秋二夏一之比例，分两次征收，即今年秋天征收税额约三分之二，明年麦秋再征三分之一，农民无夏收者，一次收齐。
    （五）关于随房产税地产税营利事业所得税与营业税附征小学教育费
    　　及清洁卫生费的决议
    市小学教育费清洁卫生费为地方性之开支，应暂时随房产税、地产税及营利事业所得税与营业税一并征收。理由：
    小学教育费和清洁卫生费原属于地方性开支。本市自解放后，曾征收过两次地方行政事业费，当时因系沿用旧自治捐征收办法课征，形成逐户摊派，甚不合理。故市政府已于五月间决定停征，但上述两项费用为本市必要支出，其全年支出为：
    （１）小学教育费：城区小学教职员工人数为二千七百二十九人（现有二千五百九十八人，另加百分之五预备数），薪资公杂费月支约八十九万二千三百○五斤，全年约需一千○七十万○七千六百六十斤。
    （２）街道清洁卫生费（清扫夫工资等）：每年约需一千○五万四千九百五十斤。
    以上两项合计每年约需二千○七十六万二千六百一十斤，此项开支根据各城市惯例及现在实施情况，均应因地制宜由地方筹措。办法：
    根据以上情况，决定以附征方法解决，房产税地产税附征百分之三十，所得税营业税附征百分之十，于今后征收上项三种税收时开始附征。其属于郊区之附加税应作为郊区小学之经费。
