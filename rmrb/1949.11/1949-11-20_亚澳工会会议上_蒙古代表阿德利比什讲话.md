Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 19th: Abstract of the report by Mongolian delegate Adili Bish at the Asian-Australasian Trade Union Conference today.

　　The Mongolian people, with the fraternal assistance of the great Soviet Union, and under the leadership of their own People's Revolutionary Party, carried out a people's democratic revolution in 1921, expelled foreign invaders from their homeland, overthrew the domestic oppressive classes, and established the government of the independent national Mongolian People's Republic. This opened up a bright road for the free development and happy life of our people.

　　In the years of our development without feudalists and capitalists, a national industry has emerged, and as a result, a young working class has grown and consolidated.

　　Our country fundamentally does not know what unemployment and hunger are.

　　Our people are deeply convinced of the possibility of realizing a socialist society, and under the leadership of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and the government headed by Marshal Choibalsan, they are sparing no effort in the struggle to promote its realization.

　　The young working class of our country, organized in trade unions, has always served this aspiration of the people, playing the role of an active force in socialist construction.

　　As the Mongolian People's Republic develops, our trade unions, which have grown and consolidated, have become the largest democratic organizations and schools of the working class. The trade unions educate the working class with the spirit of friendship and fraternal peace and democracy among the peoples of all countries.

　　Our trade unions, regardless of race, nationality, social origin, religion, or political views, include workers, technical workers, staff, and intellectuals in all kinds of enterprises in their organizations.

　　Our trade unions, using the rich experience of the Soviet Union, make laborers actively participate in the revolutionary construction cause, and constantly try in all aspects to continuously improve the living and cultural standards of laborers. Our trade unions are the organizers of worker competitions in factories, transportation, state farms, and government agencies for the development of our economy and culture.

　　Now, ninety percent of the workers in our country are participating in revolutionary competitions, and outstanding individuals are awarded the title of "Mongolian People's Republic Shock Worker". In the recent seven years, the number of shock workers has increased fifteen-fold.

　　The highest awards of our government, the Orders of the Mongolian People's Republic, are awarded to the most outstanding workers and dedicated technicians, engineers, and staff. Twenty percent of our trade union members have received this award.

　　Our country has started the work of the Five-Year Plan since 1948. The first Five-Year Plan of the Mongolian People's Republic, passed in 1947, has caused a very broad upsurge in the labor of our people.

　　In the first year of the Five-Year Plan, the number of such excellent production members as the workers of the Ulaanbaatar felt and felt boot factory, Pengchuke Yuandeng, who over-fulfilled the entire five-year production quota, is increasing day by day.

　　The trade unions of the Mongolian People's Republic, in order to mobilize the enthusiasm of the working masses, successfully complete the Five-Year Plan, increase labor productivity, reduce the cost of products, improve the quality of products, examine the work of enterprises and production organs, and improve their responsibility, and improve the lives and culture of workers, factories, farms and factories, and local trade unions jointly sign collective contracts. This year, about 60-70% of the opinions put forward by the workers have been adopted in the provisions of the collective contract.

　　In the collective contract, the obligations borne by the factory management are to improve the labor conditions of the workers, provide clean factories, technically safe conditions, protect the health of the workers, and provide cultural equipment for all workers. The obligations borne by the trade unions are to cherish and save the factory's machines and materials, each worker should over-fulfill the plan, fight against the phenomenon of substandard production and undisciplined phenomena, make strong supervision on the implementation of labor laws, and widely carry out cultural education and reasonable cultivation work among the workers.

　　In our country, social insurance and labor protection issues are entirely led by our trade unions. The Constitution and labor laws guarantee the right to carry out inspections and all measures to improve the living conditions of workers. According to labor law, the social insurance funds used are paid by the state.

　　Our country stipulates that the working day is eight hours, and works six days a week for seven days. There are also regular holidays with normal pay from two weeks to four weeks each year.

　　Our country has banned the use of child labor since the first day of the revolution, and implemented the principle of equal pay for equal work for men and women.

　　One of the greatest tasks carried out by the Mongolian trade unions is to organize reasonable rest for workers and staff. The hot springs, sanatoriums, and health dining halls established by the trade unions have increased threefold in the recent six years. The number of people who rested in 1948 increased seven times compared with 1940, and in 1949 various sanatoriums were further expanded.

　　When this five-year plan is completed, that is, in 1952, the sanatoriums, rest homes, and health dining halls will be doubled compared with 1947, and the number of people who rest will increase eight times.

　　In 1949, social insurance fees increased by 3.8 times compared with 1940. Workers and staff can use hospitals, rest homes, sanatoriums and other medical equipment for free.

　　Labor protection work is being carried out vigorously in various factories, and the number of accidents at work in factories has decreased by 50% in the recent seven years.

　　Our country has opened up complete conditions for all laborers and workers' children to receive free education from elementary school to specialized schools and universities. Students studying at universities, higher education institutions, and specialized schools are paid salaries. Eliminating illiteracy is one of the basic tasks of our country's cultural revolution, and our trade unions provide literacy education to illiterate adults.

　　Our trade unions conduct education work in the languages of various ethnic groups such as Cossacks and Chinese among workers of various ethnic groups. The trade unions have their own central "Labor News" and the Chinese "Worker's Road News," both of which are published regularly.

　　The goal of all education and cultural measures taken by the trade unions is to ensure the improvement of the education level of the working class and to educate them to be loyal to the spirit of proletarian internationalism.

　　Mongolian trade unions are unified. From the primary organizations to the highest organizations, the trade unions are generated by democratic elections, and make periodic reports to the electors. Democratic centralism is the organizational foundation of the trade union.

　　Our trade unions pay great attention to the common struggle for peace and democracy, and believe that this is the vanguard force for consolidating the laborers of the whole world.

　　The charter of the Mongolian trade unions writes, "Mongolian trade unions sincerely hope to consolidate the fraternal ties of the working class all over the world."

　　Now, our Mongolian trade unions, together with all the laborers of their country, are fighting to establish lasting world peace and democracy and protect the safety of the people of all countries, firmly standing on the united democratic camp of just laborers all over the world, and opposing the imperialists' instigation of bloody new wars.

　　Our working class is mobilizing all its strength for the cause of consolidating peace and democracy, and hates the policy of the reactionary camp headed by the US and British imperialists to instigate new wars.

　　The Mongolian trade unions warmly support the call issued by the International Cultural Workers and Peace Protection Committee, the World Democratic Women's League, to convene the World Peace Congress, and actively participated in the congress.

　　The Mongolian trade unions, in this era when all the people are fighting against new war disasters, sincerely desire the unity of the international working-class movement, and respond to the call of the World Federation of Trade Unions with this desire and join the World Federation of Trade Unions.

　　Our trade union representatives participated in the representative conferences of organizing leather and shoe industry trade unions and international education workers' representative conferences, and participated in various industrial departments of the World Federation of Trade Unions.

　　Our trade unions, together with all their people, warmly accepted and have implemented the call issued by the World Federation of Trade Unions on actively participating in the World Remembrance Day for the international peace struggle.

　　The Mongolian People's Republic recently held a representative conference for defending world peace, and 20% of the representatives attending were representatives of our trade unions.

　　Our Mongolian trade union organizations, educated with the ideas of internationalism, international cooperation, and friendship among all nations, firmly believe that in the future they must faithfully work for the cause of peace and friendship among all nations and consolidating the unity of international workers, and actively implement the resolutions of the World Federation of Trade Unions' regulations and leading organs.

    【新华社北京十九日电】蒙古代表阿德利比什今日在亚澳工会会议的报告摘要。
    蒙古人民在一九二一年受到伟大苏联国家的兄弟援助，在自己人民革命党的领导下，进行人民民主革命，由祖国内驱逐了外国侵略者、推翻国内压迫阶级，建立了民族独立的蒙古人民共和国政府。由此开辟了我们人民的自由发展、幸福生活的光明大路。
    我们在没有封建主义者、没有资本家而发展的年份里，产生了民族工业，其结果青年工人阶级成长巩固了。
    我国根本就不知道失业和饥饿是什么。
    我们人民深信实现社会主义社会的可能，并为促进其实现，在以却尔巴桑元帅为首的蒙古人民革命党及政府的领导下，不遗余力地作着斗争。
    组织在职工会里的我国青年工人阶级，始终为人民的这个愿望服务，起着建设社会主义之积极力量的作用。
    随着蒙古人民共和国的发展，而生长巩固了的我国职工会，成了工人阶级的最广大的民主组织和工人阶级的学校。职工会以各国人民间的友好及兄弟间的和平民主精神，教育着工人阶级。
    我们的职工会不分人种、民族、社会出身、宗教和政治观点，把各种企业里的工人，技术工作者，职员、知识分子一律包容在自己的组织里。

    我国自一九四八年起，已开始了五年计划的工作。一九四七年所通过的蒙古人民共和国第一个五年计划，引起了我国人民劳动上极广阔的高潮。
    在五年计划第一年度中，即把整个五年的生产定量超过完成了的乌蓝巴特尔市毡子及毡靴子工厂的工人彭楚克袁登等这样优秀的生产分子的人数逐日增加起来了。
    蒙古人民共和国的职工会为发动工人群众的积极性，顺利地完成五年计划，增进劳动生产率，减低生产品的成本费，改善生产品的质量，考核企业及生产机关的工作，并提高其责任性，提高工人生活及文化，工厂管理机关，农庄与工厂，地方工会间双方订立集体合同。今年工人所提出的意见约百分之六七十已被采纳在集体合同的条文里。
    在集体合同里，工厂管理机关所负担的义务是改善工人劳动状态，提供工厂清洁，技术上的安全等条件，保护工人的健康，供给全体工人文化设备等。职工会所负担的义务是爱护和节约工厂的机器、物资、每个工人都超过完成计划、与生产不合格的现象及不守纪律的现象作斗争，对于履行劳动法，作强有力的监督，在工人中间广泛地进行文化教育及合理修养的工作等。

    我们的职工会对于为和平民主的共同斗争给与极大的注意，并认为这是对于巩固全世界劳动者之先锋力量。
    蒙古职工会的章程中写着“蒙古职工会衷心希望巩固全世界工人阶级的兄弟联系”。
    现在我们蒙古职工会，和自己国家全体劳动者一同为确立世界持久和平及民主、保护各国人民的安全进行斗争，坚决地站在全世界正义劳动者的统一民主阵营方面，反对帝国主义者挑动血腥的新战争。
