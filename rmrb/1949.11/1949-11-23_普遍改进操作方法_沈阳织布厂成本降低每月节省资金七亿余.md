Universal Improvement of Operating Methods
Shenyang Weaving Factory Reduces Costs, Saving Over 700 Million Funds Monthly

[This Newspaper's News] After setting a national record for reducing the consumption rate of raw yarn, the Shenyang Weaving Factory continued its efforts and set a new record in early November. According to statistics from the first to the sixth of the month, the consumption rate has dropped from the October record of 0.715% to 0.491%, thereby reducing the unit cost per bolt of cloth (calculated using 34 twill as the standard) from 2,468,742 yuan (Northeast currency, ditto) stipulated by the Textile Administration Bureau to 2,392,586 yuan. Each bolt of cloth's cost is reduced by 76,156 yuan. If calculated based on an average monthly output of 10,000 bolts, the state can accumulate 760 million yuan per month (other savings not included). The factory achieved such results because the various improvements in operating methods that emerged during the October record-breaking were universally adopted by all workers. Without exception, each workshop has a registration form hanging, recording the daily consumption of each person. The predetermined average consumption rate of the workshop is written in conspicuous large characters on each form. Through such rigorous registration work, a wave of competition to reduce consumption has been created throughout the factory. The weaving workshop also implemented a "look-back" work diary system, whereby the "look-back" workers record once a day, specifying the length of cloth dismantled by each worker and the number of times dismantled. The implementation of this system has played a significant role in reducing raw yarn consumption and wasted labor time.

　　普遍改进操作方法
　　沈阳织布厂成本降低每月节省资金七亿余
    【本报讯】沈阳织布厂创降低原纱消耗率的全国纪录后，再接再厉，于十一月初旬复创新纪录。据一日至六日一周间之统计，消耗率已由十月份的纪录百分之○·七一五降至○·四九一，从而使每匹布的单位成本（以３４斜纹为标准计算），由纺织管理局规定的二、四六八、七四二元（东北币，不同），降为二、三九二、五八六元，计每匹布成本降低七六、一五六元，如以每月平均产布万匹计算，每月即可为国家积累资金七亿六千万元（其他方面节省未计在内）。该厂获得如此成绩，是由于十月份创纪录中出现的操作方法上的各种改进，已普遍为各工友所采用。各车间无例外地挂着记载每人每日消耗量的登记表，每张表上用醒目的大字写着本车间预定的平均消耗率，通过这样严格的登记工作，在全厂造成了竞相降低消耗的热潮。织布间并实行了见回工作日记制度，由见回工人每天登记一次，写明每个工人拆布的长短，和拆除次数。这种制度的实行在减少原纱消耗和劳动时间的浪费上起着极大推动作用。
