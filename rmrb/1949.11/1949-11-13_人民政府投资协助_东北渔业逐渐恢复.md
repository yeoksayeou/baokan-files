Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, November 11th: The fishery production, one of the immense resources of Northeast China, is being vigorously restored. The coastal fishing areas stretch from Shanhaiguan in the west to Andong in the east, encompassing the vast seas of the Bohai Sea and the northern part of the Yellow Sea in the entire Liaodong region, all abundant with saltwater fish resources. The Heilongjiang, Ussuri, Songhua, and Nenjiang rivers, as well as lakes such as Xingkai (jointly owned by China and the Soviet Union) and Jingbo, are the main gathering areas for freshwater fish. More than 60 species of fish can be caught in these areas each year, with an average output of about 100,000 tons. Among saltwater fish, yellow croaker, knife fish, prawns, silver fish, shrimp, and large green shrimp are the most famous of more than ten species. Shrimp account for one-third of the total output, and in addition to being widely sold locally, they can also be processed into large and small dried shrimp for export. Among freshwater fish in inland rivers, the large Kaluga sturgeon produced in the Ussuri and Heilongjiang rivers is the most valuable, with an annual output of about 50,000 kilograms, which used to be sold well in Beijing, Tianjin, Nanjing, Shanghai and other places. The harvesting and sale of fish in various places are of great significance for improving people's lives and increasing national income. After the liberation of Northeast China, thanks to the vigorous support of the people's governments at all levels and the continuous solution of fishermen's difficulties and sales problems, the output has increased rapidly.

	The Yellow Sea fishing area in the eastern part of the Liaodong Peninsula was liberated in the spring of 1947. The People's Government immediately invested and loaned more than 1 billion Northeast Yuan (hereinafter the same), and also lent a large number of materials to solve some of the fishermen's living difficulties, so that the fish catch reached 15,000 tons that year. Last year, due to the gradual increase of fishermen's fishing gear, the output increased to 26,645 tons. This spring, the People's Government re-issued loans of more than 17 billion yuan, 6 million catties of food, and supplied more than 3 million catties of coarse salt at low prices, enabling more than 65,000 fishermen to go to sea smoothly, so the output increased by 14% compared with last year. In the Liaodong Bay fishing area of Liaoxi Province in the western part of the peninsula, after liberation last winter, the People's Government also allocated more than 2.83 billion yuan in loans and 756,000 catties of food, enabling more than 2,000 fishermen to repair 24,538 fishing nets and 4,135 fish hooks that had been shelved for a long time, and enabling 1,288 fishing boats to return to the sea. Although it suffered a typhoon, the fishermen worked hard to overcome difficulties and finally caught more than 3.5 million catties of various fish and shrimp. The recovery of the fishery in the Lushun-Dalian area is even faster. Last year's output reached 2,112 tons, and this year, due to the planned increase in fish prices, the lives of fishermen have been greatly improved. With the assistance of the people's governments at all levels, the fish production in inland rivers and lakes has also recovered rapidly in recent years. Last year's freshwater fish production was 30,146 tons, accounting for one-third of the total fishery production of 94,000 tons in Northeast China. The Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the Northeast People's Government has planned to catch 109,200 tons of fish in 1950, and requires all localities to restore the highest output of 174,000 tons in 1944 within the next three years.

	Simultaneous with the rapid recovery of fishery production in various places, the leadership of the people's governments at all levels in the fishery industry and the organization of fishermen have also been gradually strengthened. Liaodong, Liaoxi, Heilongjiang and other provinces have successively established aquatic product bureaus, and Lushun-Dalian has established an aquatic product company. Fishermen's supply and marketing cooperatives in various places have achieved many successes in solving production and sales difficulties. Liaodong Province has established 28 fishermen's cooperatives with more than 10,000 members. In addition to organizing a large number of supply and marketing cooperatives, Songjiang and other places have also established cold storage warehouses and canning factories. In addition, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry is also preparing to establish two fishery experiment stations, and restore the Jilin and Liaoyang breeding farms that can raise 50 million fish fry, so as to breed a large number of freshwater fish.

### 人民政府投资协助  东北渔业逐渐恢复

    人民政府投资协助
    东北渔业逐渐恢复
    争取三年内达到年产十七万四千吨
    【新华社沈阳十一日电】东北巨大富源之一的渔产，正在大力恢复中。沿海渔区西起山海关，东至安东，整个辽东的渤海与黄海北部的广大海洋中，均有极丰盛的咸水渔产。内中的黑龙江、乌苏里江、松花江、嫩江等河流和兴凯（中苏各半）、镜泊等湖泽，则为淡水鱼的主要采集区。上述各地每年可捕鱼六十余种，平均产量在十万吨左右。咸水鱼中以黄花鱼、刀鱼、对虾、银鱼、毛虾、大青虾等十余种最为著名。而毛虾占总产量三分之一，除普遍销于本地外，尚可制造大、小虾米输出外地。内河淡水鱼中，以乌苏里江、黑龙江所产的大吗蛤鱼最为名贵，年产约十余万斤，以往均畅销于京、津、宁、沪等地。各地鱼类的采销，对于改善人民生活和增进国家收入上均有重大意义。东北解放后，由于各地人民政府的大力扶植以及不断解决了渔民困难和销路问题，产量因此迅速上升。
    辽东半岛东部的黄海渔区于一九四七年春重获解放后，人民政府当即投资和贷款十余亿元东北币（下同），此外还贷出大批物资，解决了渔民们部分的生活困难，使当年捕鱼达一万五千吨。去年由于渔民渔具的逐渐增加，产量增至两万六千六百四十五吨。今春人民政府复发贷款一百七十余亿元，代粮六百万斤，并低价供给三百余万斤大盐，使六万五千余渔民得以顺利下海捕鱼，因此产量比去年增加了百分之十四。半岛西部辽西省的辽东湾渔区，去冬解放后，人民政府亦拨出代款二十八亿三千余万元，代粮七十五万六千余斤，使两千余户渔民得以修补了搁置已久的二万四千五百三十八片渔网和四千一百三十五把鱼钩，使一千二百八十八只渔船重新下海。其间虽曾遭受台风侵袭，但因渔民努力克服困难，终于捕得各种鱼虾三百五十余万斤。旅大地区的渔业恢复更快，去年产量即已达到二千一百十二吨，今年因有计划地提高鱼价，渔民生活大为改善。内地各河泽的鱼产，数年来在各地人民政府的扶助下，恢复也很迅速。去年淡水鱼产为三万零一百四十六吨，占东北全境渔产总量九万四千吨的三分之一。东北人民政府农林部已计划于一九五○年度捕鱼十万九千二百吨，并要求各地在今后三年中，恢复到一九四四年最高产量十七万四千吨的水平。
    与各地渔产迅速恢复同时，各级人民政府对渔业的领导及渔民组织工作，亦已逐步加强。辽东、辽西、黑龙江等省已先后成立了水产局，旅大已成立了水产公司。各地的渔民供销合作社，在解决产销困难上，获得了不少成绩。辽东省已建立二十八个渔民合作社，社员达一万余人。松江等地除大量组织供销合作社外，并特设冷冻仓库和罐头工厂。此外，农林部还准备设立两处渔业试验场，恢复能养五千万尾鱼苗的吉林和辽阳两处养殖场，以便大量繁殖淡水鱼。
