    Hejian Peanut Harvest Abundant
    Sales Urgently Need Resolution
    Economic Departments Should Quickly Devise Methods for Purchase
    [This Newspaper's Report] The peanut harvest in Hejian County, Hebei Province, is abundant, and the problem of sales urgently needs to be resolved. This spring, with the strong support and leadership of the local government and Party committee, the vast number of farmers in Hejian greatly expanded the peanut planting area. In the 14th district, Xiaoliguanzhuang, and the 4th district, Banjianhe, and eighteen other villages, peanut planting reached 50% of the total cultivated land. Villages such as Ningzhuang in the 1st district, which had no planting habits, also exceeded last year's acreage by four or five times. The total planting area in the county was 68,456 mu. Due to the heavy rains and damp soil this year, and the diligence of the farmers in weeding and fertilizing, the peanut harvest is abundant. With the exception of 936 mu that were flooded and yielded no harvest, the county can harvest 20,256,000 jin of peanuts. All have now been dug, dried, and stored in warehouses. However, because no one is purchasing them, sales are sluggish. In previous years, as soon as the peanuts came on the market, orders would be placed, and local oil mills would begin to purchase them for oil extraction. This year, however, because the publicity of the tax policy has been insufficient, most oil mills are afraid to open due to concerns about high tax rates, and some oil mills cannot afford to open due to lack of capital. At the same time, the price is too low, and the farmers suffer too much. In previous years, one jin of dried peanuts could be exchanged for two jin of grain, but this year it can only be exchanged for one jin, or even less. Farmers are eager to sell their peanuts to exchange them for clothes and grain, and speculative merchants are taking the opportunity to drive down prices, causing the farmers to suffer greatly. In order to guarantee farmers' profits and expand the peanut planting area next year, the local government should publicize the tax policy to the masses, call on oil mills to extract oil, and support the export of white oil. Economic departments should promptly discuss purchasing peanuts, appropriately control prices, or exchange them for cotton and cloth, which are currently needed by the farmers, in order to solve the practical difficulties of the farmers.

    河间花生丰收
    销路急待解决
    经济部门应迅速设法收购
    【本报讯】河北省河间县花生丰收，现在急待解决销路问题。今年春天，河间广大农民，经过当地政府及党委的大力扶持和领导，大大扩大了花生的种植面积，十四区小里官庄和四区半截河等十八个村，种花生即达耕地总数的百分之五十；没有种植习惯的一区宁庄等村庄，也超过了去年的四、五倍。计全县共种花生六万八千四百五十六亩。由于今年雨多地湿，农民勤锄施肥大，因而花生丰收。全县除九百三十六亩被涝无收成外，可收花生两千零二十五万六千斤。现已全部刨完晒干入仓。但因没人收购销路不畅，往年花生一上场，即有订户前来订购，当地油坊亦即开始收购榨油，而今年因为税收政策宣传的不够，大部油坊顾虑税率高而不敢开张，也有些油坊因无资本开不起。同时价格过低农民太吃亏，往年每斤干花生能换二斤粮食，今年只能换一斤甚至一斤也换不了，农民急待卖花生，换回衣服和粮食，投机商人即乘机压价收购，使农民吃亏很大。为保证农民利润及扩大明年种花生的面积，当地政府应向群众宣传税收政策，号召油坊榨油，扶持白油出口。各经济部门应迅速讨论收购花生，适当掌握价格，或以当前农民所需——棉、布换取，以解决农民实际困难。
