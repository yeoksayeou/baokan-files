　　Investigation and Research Should Be Based on Facts; Northeast China Checks the Phenomenon of Indiscriminate Issuance of Forms
    [This Newspaper News] According to recent inspections in various parts of Northeast China, it has been found that many working departments are unwilling to go deep into the lower levels to understand the situation and solve practical problems. Instead, they issue dispensable or even completely useless documents and forms. As a result, lower-level cadres (especially in counties, districts, and villages) waste a lot of time and manpower on this. Some make false reports, deceiving themselves and others; some have to set up special personnel to handle documents and forms.
    According to incomplete statistics from the Jinxi County Government of Liaoxi Province, the agricultural system alone has issued 46 types of forms in the past six months. Among them, there are even several that statistically analyze the gender of sheep, goats, chickens, ducks, geese, and rabbits, as well as the age statistics of three months, one year, three years, six years to more than ten years. It is said that when the Provincial Department of Agriculture made these forms, they debated for three days over how many colors should be investigated. In addition, according to statistics from the Shuangcheng County Party Committee, the provincial government departments issued as many as 96 types of survey forms in June alone, of which 64 were handled by the county, 31 by the districts and villages, and 1 by various agencies; their nature: 60 for industry and commerce, 17 for civil affairs, 2 for food, 3 for health, 5 for agriculture, 6 for finance, 1 for education, 1 for Northeast Fuel Company, and 1 for marriage. Xitanghe Village, Haicheng County, Liaodong Province, received 53 types of forms and 96 official documents in half a year. These forms are mostly similar. Among them, except for a part that is needed and useful, the vast majority are useless, or useful but cannot be filled out by village cadres. And there are many specialized or typical investigations that should not be used as general investigations; some only need to be sent to the province and county, and cannot be sent further down; some simply do not need to be sent. Therefore, the lower-level cadres feel a heavy burden. Some district and village cadres in Jilin Province reflected: "Filling out forms for the higher authorities all day long." After a long time, they adopted coping methods. Some did not fill out or report, some fabricated casually, and some hired an old staff member to close the door and "make" forms. This shows that this bureaucratic formalism is troubling our vast number of cadres (especially district and village cadres), wasting their incalculable energy to run around with forms and document affairs. This not only delays many mass work that should be done and must be done, wastes a large amount of manpower and material resources, but more importantly, using it as the basis for making policy decisions will inevitably mislead the work due to its lack of scientific authenticity. Therefore, it is urgent for all working departments, especially the leading departments, to check and correct this.

### 调查研究应该实事求是东北检查滥发表格现象

　　调查研究应该实事求是东北检查滥发表格现象
    【本报讯】根据最近东北各地检查，发现不少工作部门不愿深入下层了解情况，解决实际问题，而发些可有可无甚至有的是完全无用的文牍表格下去，其结果造成下边干部（特别是县区村）为此而浪费许多时间和人力，有的则做假报告，自欺欺人；有的不得不设专人跑文牍跑表格。
    据辽西省锦西县府不完全的统计，只农业系统半年来所发的表格即有四十六种，其中有数种甚至是调查绵羊、山羊、鸡、鸭、鹅、兔等的公、母性别统计及三个月、一岁、三岁、六岁至十几岁的年龄统计的。据说省农业厅在制做这些表格时，为争论应分几种毛色调查而辩论三天。另外根据双城县委统计，只六月份省府各厅所发调查表即有九十六种之多，其中属于县办的六十四种，区村办者三十一种，各机关办者一种；其性质：工商六十种，民政十七种，粮食二种，卫生三种，农业五种，财政六种，教育一种，东北燃料公司一种，婚姻一种。辽东省海城县西汤河村半年接到表格五十三种，公文九十六件，这些表格都大同小异。其中除了一部分是需要和有用的外，绝大多数是无用的，或者有用但为村干部所不能填写的。并有许多是专门的或典型的调查，而不应作一般调查；有些只要发到省县即可，不能再往下发；有的就根本没有发的必要。因之下边干部对此负担感到很重。吉林省有的区村干部反映：“整天给上级填表”，久了也就采取了应付的方法，有的采取不填不报，有的则随便编造，有的专雇一个旧职员专门关门“造”表。这说明这种官僚文牍主义作风正在苦恼着我们广大的干部（特别是区村干部），使他们浪费了不可计算的精力来奔跑表格与文牍事务，这样不仅耽误了许多应该做而且必须做的群众工作，浪费了大批人力物力，而特别重要的是以之做决定政策方针的根据，必然因其缺乏科学的真实性而贻误工作。因此急待各个工作部门特别是领导部门检查纠正。
