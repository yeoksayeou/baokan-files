Political Economy Tutorial Introduction (26) The Object, Task, and Characteristics of Political Economy Research
Chapter Three: The Task and Significance of Political Economy and the Chinese Revolution
Section One: The Task and Significance of Political Economy
The Task of Marxist-Leninist Political Economy

What Marxist-Leninist political economy aims to study, in addition to the commonalities and common laws of the economy of each era or a certain era in human social history, also includes the different characteristics and special laws of the economy of each era or a certain era in human society. The important thing is to study the various special laws of the economy of each era, to study the special laws of the main economy that occupies the leading and dominant position in the economy of each era. This is the task of Marxist-Leninist political economy. Regarding this point, Engels gave a very clear instruction in his book "Anti-Dühring":

"The conditions under which human beings produce and exchange vary not only from nation to nation, but also from epoch to epoch within the same nation. Political economy, therefore, cannot be identical for all countries and for all historical epochs. A vast distance separates the economy of peoples living on the land of Tierra del Fuego from that of modern England, with its gigantic industry and world commerce. The Patagonians do not know the use of bills of exchange, nor did they know anything about the financial crises that sweep the modern world. Therefore, anyone who attempts to subject the political economy of Tierra del Fuego to the same laws as those which govern modern England, can obviously produce nothing but sheer nonsense. Political economy is therefore essentially a historical science. It deals with material which is historical, that is, constantly subject to change. It investigates, in the first place, the special laws governing each individual stage in the evolution of production and exchange, and only when it has completed this investigation can it establish the few, quite general laws which hold good for production and exchange in general. At the same time it goes without saying that the laws which are valid for definite modes of production and exchange are valid for all historical periods in which these modes of production and exchange prevail. Thus, for instance, the introduction of metallic money had results of importance for a series of periods reaching far beyond the time of its first appearance." (Anti-Dühring, Part II, Section III)

All the theoretical doctrines of Marxism-Leninism revolve around a central task, which is to elucidate the laws of social development. Before the proletariat seizes power, we must use these laws to guide the revolutionary movement of the proletariat and other working people, to seek the liberation of the proletariat and other working people, and to promote and accelerate the realization of socialism worldwide. After the proletariat wins victory in a country, we rely on it to strive for the construction of socialism or new democracy in our own country on the one hand, and to strive to assist the socialist revolution and the people's democratic revolution of the proletariat in various countries around the world on the other. Marxist-Leninist political economy, as an important component of Marxism-Leninism, is a science used to elucidate the laws of the historical development of the foundation structure of society—the historical economic structure of society. Therefore, its task is completely consistent with the overall task of Marxism-Leninism and serves this overall task of Marxism-Leninism. In today's New China, where the working class has led the people to gain political power, we study it in order to understand and master the laws of economic development of the new democracy, to build a new democratic economy, to oppose and eliminate all obstacles that hinder and undermine the construction of the new democratic economy, to overcome all difficulties in the construction of the new democratic economy, to wage irreconcilable struggles against various hostile economies at home and abroad, to launch criticisms against various erroneous and reactionary economic theories and economic ideas, and to prepare conditions for the future transition to a socialist economy.

Broad Political Economy

Political economy is divided into two types: broad political economy and narrow political economy. Broad political economy is the science that studies the relations of production in various eras of human social history. Its task is to discover the relations of production in various eras of human society, as well as the laws that govern the economic movements of various eras, that is, to discover the laws of the generation, establishment, development, decline, and demise of the economy of each era. Specifically, the task of broad political economy is to discover the laws of production and distribution in the self-sufficient economy, the laws of production, exchange, and distribution in the commodity economy. Engels once gave it a classic definition:

"In the widest sense, the political economy is the science of the laws governing the production and exchange of the material means of subsistence in human society." (Engels: "Anti-Dühring" Part II Economics Section 1 Object and Method)

"Political economy, in the broad sense, is the science of the conditions and forms of production and exchange in various human societies, as well as the distribution of products adapted to production and exchange." (Ibid.)

Within the scope of research of broad political economy, all kinds of different economic relations and different social relations of production in various eras of human social history are its research objects or research scope. Today, all kinds of economic forms existing in modern society and various social economic forms that have existed in history have become the research objects or research scope of broad political economy. The economic forms of societies in history are various. Even the economic forms existing in societies where the capitalist economy dominates are extremely complex and develop very unevenly. Capitalist commodity economy is more complex than simple commodity economy, and simple commodity economy is more complex than self-sufficient economy. The new democratic economy also has its complexity and diversity. Our purpose is to explore the laws governing the movement of those economic forms from these intricate and diverse forms, which is also the task of our broad political economy.

The Foundation and Construction of Broad Political Economy

Although this broad political economy had not yet been established when Engels wrote "Anti-Dühring" (1877-78) and was considered to need to be created in the future, Marx and Engels were the first to transform political economy into a true science, laying a certain foundation for broad political economy. They not only studied the economy of capitalist society and elaborated on the laws of economic movement in capitalist society, thereby creating narrow political economy, but also studied the economies of various societies before capitalism and elaborated on certain economic laws, laying a certain foundation for the establishment of broad political economy. All these can be seen in the materials on various social economies of various eras in the works such as "Capital," "Family, Private Property, and the Origin of the State."

After the death of Marx and Engels, capitalism developed to the highest stage—the stage of imperialism. The economy of imperialism appeared in the world. Lenin made a profound study of the economy of imperialism and its laws of development and wrote the famous book "Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism," which became a continuation and development of the theory of "Capital" and expanded the foundation of broad political economy.

    政治经济学教程绪论（２６）  政治经济学的研究对象任务及其特点
    第三章  政治经济学的任务  意义与中国革命
    第一节  政治经济学的任务与意义
    马列主义政治经济学的任务
    马列主义政治经济学所要研究的，除了人类社会历史上各时代或一时代经济的共同点，共同的规律以外，还要研究人类社会各时代或一时代经济的不同特点，特殊的规律。而重要的还是在于研究各时代或一时代经济中各种特殊的规律，研究各时代经济中占领导支配地位的那种主要的经济的特殊规律，这便是马列主义政治经济学的任务。关于这一点，恩格斯早在“反杜林论”一书中有非常明确的指示：
    “人类进行生产交换的那些条件，不仅因国家而不同，而且在同一国家中也是因时代变迁而不同。所以政治经济学对于一切国度对于一切时代不能都是相同的。从弓箭、石斧、和间或偶然进行的野兽的交易等起，到近代数千匹马力的蒸汽机关、机器织机、铁道、英格兰银行止，有着莫大的距离。巴塔哥尼亚人，如果不知道大量生产和世界商业，也不会知道空头支票和投机恐慌。所以谁要想把巴塔哥尼亚的经济和今天英国的经济置于同一的规律下，显然地，他除了那些糊涂的平凡事情以外，再也弄不明白什么东西。所以政治经济学本来就是一种历史的科学。它要研究历史的，也就是不断变化着的材料。它首先要研究生产与交换各个发展阶段的特殊规律，然后才能作为这种研究的结论，定出可以适用于一般的生产与交换的少数、完全普遍的诸规律。自然这时候适用于一定的生产方式与交换形式的规律，同时也能适用于那些具有相同的生产方式与交换形式的一切时代。例如：与金属货币的采用一起，一系列的规律同时发生了作用，这些规律，对于那些借金属货币为交换媒介的一切国家与一切时代，也都可以适用。”（“反杜林论”第二编第三节）
    马列主义的一切理论学说，都围绕着一个中心的任务，这个任务就是阐明社会发展的规律，当无产阶级还没有掌握政权前，我们就要依据这些规律去指导无产阶级与其他劳动人民的革命运动，谋取无产阶级与其他劳动人民的解放，以推动与促进全世界社会主义的实现。当无产阶级在一国内获得胜利以后，我们依据它一方面就要为本国社会主义的或新民主主义的建设而奋斗，另一方面就要为援助世界各国无产阶级的社会主义革命与人民民主革命而努力。马列主义政治经济学，是马列主义的一个重要构成部分，是用以阐明历史上社会的基础构造——历史上社会经济结构底发展规律的科学，因此，它的任务，是与马列主义的总任务完全一致的，并服从与服务于马列主义的这个总任务的。在今天工人阶级已领导人民大众获得了政权的新中国，我们学习它，是为了了解与掌握新民主主义经济发展的规律，建设新民主主义经济反对与扫除一切阻碍与破坏新民主主义经济建设的障碍，克服一切新民主主义经济建设中的困难，与国内外各种敌对的经济进行不调和的斗争，展开对各种错误的与反动的经济理论与经济思想的批判，并为将来过渡到社会主义经济去准备条件。
    广义的政治经济学
    政治经济学分为广义的政治经济学与狭义的政治经济学两种。广义的政治经济学就是研究人类社会历史上各个时代生产关系的科学。其任务就是在于发现人类社会各个时代的生产关系，以及支配各个时代经济运动的规律，即发现各个时代经济的发生成立发展没落死亡的规律，具体些说，广义的政治经济学的任务，是在于发现自给自足经济里生产与分配的规律，商品经济里生产，交换与分配的规律的科学。恩格斯曾对它下过一个经典的定义：
    “最广义的政治经济学，是一种研究人类社会中支配物质生活资料底生产及交换的诸种规律的科学”。（恩格斯：“反杜林论”第二编经济学第一节对象与方法）
    “政治经济学，按广义的经济学说来，是研究各种不同的人类社会里生产与交换，以及与生产与交换相适应分配生产物底条件与形态的科学。”（同上）
    在广义的政治经济学的研究范围内，人类社会历史上所有各个时代各种不同的经济关系，各种不同的社会生产关系，都是它的研究对象或研究范围。在今天说来，现代社会中存在着的各种经济形式和历史上所存在过的各种社会的经济形式，都是成为广义的政治经济学的研究对象或研究范围。历史上社会的经济形式是各式各样的，即便资本主义经济占支配地位的社会中所存在着的经济形式，也是极其复杂的，发展很不平衡，资本主义商品经济比单纯商品经济复杂，单纯的商品经济比自给自足经济复杂。在新民主主义经济中也具有它的复杂性多样性。我们的目的，便是要从这些错综复杂各式各样的各种形式中探求出支配那些经济形式运动的规律，这也便是我们广义的政治经济学的任务。
    广义的政治经济学的奠基与建设
    虽然，这种广义的政治经济学，当恩格斯写“反杜林论”时（一八七七——七八年），还没有建立起来，认为还须要今后去创建起来。但是马克思和恩格斯却第一次把政治经济学变成为真正的科学，为广义的政治经济学奠建了一定的基础。他们不但研究了资本主义社会的经济，阐发了资本主义社会经济运动的规律，从而创建了狭义的政治经济学，并且与此同时，他们也研究了资本主义以前各种社会的经济，阐发了某些的经济规律，为广义的政治经济学的建立也奠定了一定的基础。这些都是我们从资本论、家族、私有财产及国家之起源等著作中，关于历史上各时代各种社会经济的材料中可以看到的。
    马克思恩格斯逝世后，资本主义发展到最高阶段——帝国主义阶段，世界上出现了帝国主义的经济，列宁对帝国主义的经济及其发展规律，作了深刻的研究，著作了资本主义底最高阶段——帝国主义这部名著，成为资本论理论上的继续与发展，并扩大了广义政治经济学的基础。
