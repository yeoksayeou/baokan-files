Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 31st:

    Hebei, Chahar, Shanxi, and Suiyuan provinces recently held trade union work conferences to discuss the implementation of the spirit of the National Trade Union Work Conference and to determine the direction and tasks of future trade union work. These conferences have made profound reviews of the prevailing closed-doorism and formalism in trade union work. Among the 300,000 workers in Hebei Province, only 110,000 have been organized so far. Many of the existing trade union organizations are merely formalities, just empty shells. After review, the First Workers' Representative Conference of Hebei Province unanimously resolved to make consolidating and expanding trade union organizations, and carrying out workers' movements with focus and in a planned manner, the central task for the coming year. At the same time, it was decided to focus on Shijiazhuang, Baoding, Qinhuangdao, Tangshan, and the industrial systems, mining areas, and other central towns in carrying out the work. The half-month-long Chahar Provincial Trade Union Work Conference seriously discussed the spirit of the National Trade Union Work Conference. The participants clearly understood the nature of trade unions and the conditions for workers to join. They recognized that past regulations requiring workers to obtain approval from the municipal party committee to join a trade union, and the blanket prohibition of workers who had participated in reactionary organizations from joining, regardless of their actual circumstances, were concrete manifestations of closed-doorism. The conference criticized these erroneous views and practices, and decided that from October of this year to October of next year, the province's workers should be basically organized. In order to complete the above tasks in a planned and step-by-step manner, the conference decided that the following four tasks must be carried out: (1) Establish trade unions, develop membership, and correct closed-doorism. (2) Promote democracy within trade unions, correct the practice of appointment and implement the election system. (3) Implement the principle of "everyone runs the trade union," and correct the practice of monopolization and substitution. (4) Promote unity and mutual assistance among workers, and correct the attitude of bestowing favors and the idea of solely relying on administrative means to solve workers' welfare problems. At the Shanxi Jinan Trade Union Work Conference, everyone reviewed that although trade union organizations had been established in many factories, most of them existed in name only. The conference reviewed that this was mainly due to the fact that cadres had switched from long-term rural work to workers' work, lacked experience, and were eager to achieve results, which led to formalism. In addition, many trade union cadres, because they did not understand the nature of trade unions, made closed-doorist mistakes in their work. For example, the Yuncheng Trade Union believed that supervisors mostly had short tenures and complex backgrounds, so it set very high membership requirements, which restricted many workers from joining. After repeated discussions, the conference clarified and changed many of the above erroneous ideas, and decided that it must expand trade union organizations in the future so that trade unions truly become mass organizations of the working class. At the inaugural meeting of the Preparatory Committee of the Suiyuan Federation of Trade Unions held in the middle of this month, the focus was on discussing how to organize 80,000 workers in Suiyuan Province in about a year. The conference decided to form trade unions for shop assistants and others in the Sui East area within the next two or three months. In Sui West, the emphasis should be on exposing the rumors and deceptions of Kuomintang secret agents among the workers and raising the workers' class consciousness. After these meetings in the above provinces, the working masses will be widely mobilized and organized, so that the economic construction of the provinces can be further promoted.

### 冀察晋绥工会工作会议　检查关门主义偏向　确定今后工作方针

　　冀察晋绥工会工作会议
  　检查关门主义偏向
  　确定今后工作方针
    【新华社北京三十一日电】河北、察哈尔、山西、绥远等地，最近先后召开工会工作会议，讨论贯彻全国工会工作会议的精神，并确定今后工会工作的方针和任务。这些会议对于工会工作中普遍存在的关门主义和形式主义的偏向，都作了深刻的检讨。河北全省三十万工人中，至今才组织起来十一万人。其中还有许多工会组织流于形式，只是一个空架子。河北省第一届工人代表会议经过检讨后，一致决议以巩固和扩大工会组织，有重点、有步骤地开展工人运动为今后一年的中心任务。同时，并确定以石家庄、保定、秦皇岛、唐山四个城市与产业系统、矿区和其他中心市镇为开展工作的重点。历时半月的察哈尔省工会工作会议，认真讨论了全国工会工作会议的精神，与会者明确地认识了工会的性质和工人入会条件，认为过去规定工人加入工会必须经市委批准，对于曾经参加过反动组织的工人，不管其实际情况如何，一概不准加入工会等等，都是关门主义的具体表现。会议批判了这些错误的观点和做法，决定从今年十月到明年十月一年间，要把全省工人基本上组织起来。为了有计划、有步骤地完成上述任务，会议决定必须开展下列四项工作：（一）建立工会、发展会员，纠正关门主义。（二）发扬工会内部的民主，纠正委派制实行选举制。（三）实行大家办工会，纠正包办代替。（四）发扬工人内部团结互助，纠正恩赐观点和单纯依靠行政解决工人福利问题的思想。在山西晋南的工会工作会议上，大家检讨到许多工厂的工会组织是有了，但多半是有名无实。会议检讨出这主要是由于干部由长期的农村工作转向工人工作，缺乏经验，又急于求成，因此便造成了形式主义的偏向。此外，又有不少工会干部，因为不了解工会的性质，在工作中犯了关门主义毛病。例如，运城工会认为监工多数是工龄短、成份复杂，所以规定了很高的入会条件，限制了许多工人入会。会议经过反复讨论，才算澄清和改变了以上的许多错误思想，决定今后必须扩大工会组织，使工会真正成为工人阶级的群众组织。本月中旬举行的绥远总工会筹备会成立大会上，着重讨论了如何在一年左右把绥远全省八万工人组织起来的问题。会议确定在绥东地区于今后两、三个月内组成店员等工会。在绥西，则着重揭破国民党特务在工人群众中的造谣欺骗，提高工人的阶级觉悟。上述各省经过这些会议后，工人群众将被广泛地发动和组织起来，使各省的经济建设推进一步。
