　　The shaping of a tax system is governed by both political and economic conditions. When political and economic changes occur, the tax system must also change accordingly. What was originally considered an important tax can become insignificant, and what was originally considered a bad tax can become a "powerful lever," simply because the political and economic foundation of the tax system has changed.

　　The commodity tax, also known as the consumption tax or indirect tax, is considered a bad tax according to bourgeois fiscal scholars, which is quite reasonable in capitalist or semi-feudal societies. In those societies, there are very serious exploitative relationships, resulting in a large disparity in the national income distributed to each individual. It is obviously unreasonable to make the poor pay the same consumption tax rate as the rich, who may not even consume as much salt. However, if the system of exploitation is overthrown and the national income of each individual is roughly equal, wouldn't it be more in line with the principles of fairness and universality to have them bear the same consumption tax rate? There is nothing unreasonable about it. In my article "The Development of a New Type of Finance" published in the Shanghai Economic Review, Volume 5, No. 3 on May 14th of this year, I stated: "The reason why indirect taxes were often called bad taxes in the past was not because the taxes themselves were bad, but because the economic foundations of those societies already had problems. The gap between rich and poor was too great, and the distribution was uneven. The ability to pay taxes varied greatly. Therefore, it was natural to aggravate inequality by requiring them to bear the same amount of consumption tax, so it was a bad tax. However, if the social and economic system undergoes epoch-making changes, and the inequality in distribution has been greatly reduced, then indirect taxes should be viewed in a new light, and they are not as bad as before. They can even be used as a means to implement policies." Therefore, in capitalist or semi-feudal societies, it can be said that direct taxes are good taxes and indirect taxes are bad taxes, but this cannot be said in socialist or new democratic societies. An ancient sage once said: "Without grasping the root, but straightening the branches, a small piece of wood can be made taller than a tall building." It is useless to talk about the merits of tax types without grasping the political and economic premises.

　　Professor Haig, an old professor of finance at the University of California, stated in the preface to the English translation of "Soviet Financial Policy" published in 1931: "A tax is very different in Russia than it is in a bourgeois country. The constitutions of the various states of the United States unanimously declare that uniformity and equality are the main conditions of tax justice. Conversely, in Soviet Russia, it should be declared that taxes should be based on the distinction of social classes, and should be used as one of the most powerful levers of Soviet social policy. In other words, it is used to achieve equality in economic life. When the Communists had not yet seized power, they attacked indirect taxes, accusing them of being harmful and unfair. But once this tax came into the hands of the Soviet rulers, it became a sacred means of guiding consumption in permissible directions. They can adopt compulsory methods for public debt, and the temptation of prize-winning lotteries is not regarded as a forbidden item. This is truly a world of upside down for us." For Professor Haig, who grew up in the atmosphere of American capitalism, it is indeed a "world of upside down"! But in a country that has overthrown the system of exploitation, the judgment of tax types naturally has a different standard and right and wrong, and has a fundamentally different view from orthodox bourgeois fiscal scholars.

　　Indirect taxes have an important mission in the series of new democratic fiscal types. Although they cannot yet catch up with the achievements shown by the Soviet Union, they do occupy a very important position for the tax functions required by the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. First, in the era of new democracy, finance has not yet been able to obtain sufficient income from state-owned enterprises in time, and the source of public income still needs to rely on taxes. At the same time, since the state allows the existence of private ownership and private enterprises, and clears obstacles and assists their development in various ways, they also have the responsibility to bear the expenses required for national construction. Therefore, tax revenue must fulfill its due task for the requirements of new democratic construction. On the basis of the current economic reality, among all existing tax categories, in addition to agricultural tax, the source of commodity tax is the broadest and the tax revenue is the largest, which is sufficient to supply the needs of national income. This is one. The levy of commodity tax will generally have a transfer effect, transferring the burden of taxation to consumers. As a result, two effects can occur: one is that consumption is necessary and does not reduce its purchase due to the burden of consumption tax, or the income is sufficient and does not feel burdened by the consumption tax. As a result, the levy of commodity tax can collect a part or surplus of the income scattered in the hands of each individual into the hands of the government, and transfer it to national construction in a planned manner. The other is that for non-essential goods, due to taxation or slightly heavier tax rates, consumption is reduced or stopped. As a result, a part of the saved income or surplus can be used for beneficial aspects and increase its social effectiveness. The "vigorous streamlining and economy" advocated in the Common Program can also play a part through the levy of commodity tax. This is two. The levy of commodity tax can directly affect consumption and indirectly affect production. After taxing or heavily taxing non-essential goods, consumption is reduced, thereby reducing production or reducing its production profit. As a result, private enterprises producing non-essential goods will gradually shrink and transfer capital and labor to beneficial directions, which will definitely have a good impact on economic construction. The Common Program stipulates that the state-owned economy should play a leading role in the private economy. At the same time, the rational use of tax policies in fiscal policy can also exert the influence of leading the private economy. This is three. The current commodity tax, taking the Interim Regulations on Commodity Tax of the North China Region promulgated on September 21 of this year as an example, has sixteen categories of taxable items, including a wide range. But we must know that under the leadership of the People's Government, not only will the taxed categories be unified, but also the tax collection agencies will be unified! In addition to a commodity tax law, there will be no more varied and fragmented disguised commodity taxes. In addition to a systematic tax bureau, there will be no more central and local divergent and opposing collection agencies of one country and three public entities. In summary, the current levy of commodity tax is greatly simplified compared to the past. Moreover, although there are many tax items, the distinction between essential goods, non-essential goods, and luxury goods is very careful. The tax rate is light or heavy, and is carefully distinguished according to the nature of the goods. From the lowest tax rate - wheat flour is levied ad valorem at 2.5% to the highest tax rate - machine-made cigarettes are levied ad valorem at 100%. This can take into account the economic role of influencing consumption and leading production, the fiscal role of increasing income and pooling surplus funds, and the social role of considering life and promoting economy. This is four.

　　Commodity tax is a type of indirect tax, so what should be the reasonable ratio of today's commodity tax to direct tax? According to the bourgeois fiscal theory, such as the set popular in the United Kingdom and the United States, and the emphasis on direct taxes advocated by various parties after the start of the War of Resistance against Japan and before the liberation victory, it is inevitable to lower the proportion of commodity tax. This is not without some reason in societies like the United Kingdom and the United States and China before liberation. However, it would be fundamentally wrong to cite Anglo-American tax theories or follow the popular saying before liberation today after the Great Liberation. Even immediately emulating the Soviet Union and making direct taxes insignificant would be overstepping and rushing for quick success. Because under the new democratic economic system, the proportion of private economy is still large, which is different from the Soviet Union that has already moved to a socialist economy. We must use direct taxes, especially industrial and commercial taxes, so that the private economy can share its reasonable tax burden for national finance. Therefore, we still expect the due development of direct tax levy. The development of the private economy, reflected in tax revenue, is not the development of direct taxes? However, this development has its limits under the new democratic economic system. Because the profits of the private economy cannot be infinitely increased. When the profit exceeds a certain limit and approaches monopoly, it is absolutely not allowed by the Common Program. It is not right and impossible to obtain huge direct tax revenue from the excessive private profits under the new democracy. Therefore, although direct taxes have room for existence and development today, its proportion should always be second to commodity tax. Moreover, after the war, recovery is just beginning, and private industry and commerce cannot immediately obtain sufficient profits to increase their productivity. Then the tax rate of industrial and commercial tax not only cannot be increased, but should also be appropriately reduced. The tax on industry must be lower than the tax on commerce, and among the taxes on industry, the nature must be distinguished and preferentially reduced or exempted. In this way, the estimate of industrial and commercial tax revenue cannot be ranked above commodity tax. Naturally, if industry and commerce can achieve their reasonable development, even with low tax rates, they can increase income and exert the elasticity of taxation. However, in the proportion of the entire tax revenue, it will inevitably and should be ranked second to commodity tax, complementing each other to implement the entire financial and economic policy.

### 新财政体系中的货物税

　　新财政体系中的货物税
　　崔敬伯
    租税体系的塑形，是要受政治和经济两大条件的支配的。政治和经济有了变革，租税体系也必随着变革。原来认为重要的税，可以变为无足轻重，原来认为不良的税，可以变为“有力的槓杆”，就因为作为税制基础的政治和经济有了变化的原故。
    货物税一称消费税，也称间接税，按照资产阶级财政学者的说法，认为是不良的税，这在资本主义社会或半封建社会，自然也颇有理由。在那些社会里存在着很严重的剥削关系，以致分配到各个人的国民所得大相悬殊。穷人要吃那些盐，阔人也许吃不了那些盐，却要叫他们担负同一税率的消费税，当然是不合理的事情。但是剥削的制度如果推翻了，各个国民所得大致平均，这时叫他们负担同一税率的消费税，岂不更合于公平普遍的原则？并没有什么不合理。笔者在本年五月十四日出版的上海经济评论第五卷第三期“财政新类型的展开”一文中，曾有过这样的说法：“以前对间接税所以多称为恶税者，并不是税的本身不好，而是那些社会的经济基础，早就有了毛病。贫富悬隔分配不均，纳税能力，相差甚远，于此而令其负担同额消费税，自然加重不平，所以是恶税。但若社会经济制度有了划时代的变革，分配上的不平业已大见减轻，此时的间接税，就要刮目相视，不是以前那样坏了，还可以当作实现政策的手段”。所以，在资本主义社会或是半封建社会，可以说：直接税是良税，间接税是恶税，但在社会主义或新民主主义社会，就不能这样讲法了。古时的聪明人曾说过：“不揣其本，而齐其末，方寸之木、可使高于岑楼”，不能把握政治和经济的前提，而侈言税种的好坏，结果毫无是处。
    美国加利福尼大学的一位财政学老教授浦兰在一九三一年出版的“苏联财政政策”英译本的序言里，曾说过这样的话：“一个税，在俄国，较之在资产阶级国家，是很不相同的。美国各州的宪法，一致宣称：划一和平等是租税正义的主要条件。相反的，在苏维埃的俄国，却要宣称：租税应该根据社会阶级的分别，把它作为苏维埃社会政策最有力的＠①杆之一。换句话讲，就是作为达成经济生活的平等。共产党人当他们还没有取得政权的时候，是攻击间接税的，加以有害失平的罪名。但是这种税，一旦到了苏维埃统治者的手里，却变成指导消费于许可方向的神圣手段。他们对于公债，可以采用强制的方式，抽签给奖的引诱，也不视为禁条。这对于我们真是一个是非颠倒的世界。”这对于生长在美国资本主义的氛围里的浦兰老教授，确乎是一个“是非颠倒”的世界！但在推翻了剥削制度的国度里，对于税种的判断，自然另有一个标准和是非，和正统派资产阶级财政学者的见解，有着根本的不同
    　　　×　　　　　　×　　　　　　×　　　　　　×
    间接税在新民主主义财政类型的系列中负有重大的使命，虽然一时还赶不上苏联所表现的成绩，但是对于人民政协共同纲领所要求的租税功能，确是占很重要的地位。第一、新民主主义时代的财政，尚未能从国营事业，即时取得充分的收入，公共收入的来源，仍须仰赖于租税。同时国家既是容许私人所有私营企业的存在，而且用种种方法，清除其障碍，辅助其发展，则对于国家建设所需要的经费，亦自有力量负担的责任。所以租税收入对于新民主主义建设的要求，必须负起应尽的任务。在目前经济现实的基础之上，所有现行税类之中，除了农业税而外，自应以货物税的税源为广，税收为多，足以供应国家收入的需求，这是一。货物税的征课，在大体上是要发生转嫁作用，将租税的负担，转嫁于消费者的身上，其结果，可以发生两个影响：一个是必须消费，并不因消费税的负担而减少其购买的，或是收入充分对于消费税的负担不感沉重的，结果可以通过货物税的征课，将散在各个人手里的收入一部或余资，汇集于政府的手里，有计划的转移于国家建设之用。一个是对于非必需品，因为课税或税率稍重的原故，而减少消费或停止消费，结果可以把节约下来的一部收入或余资，更用之于有益的方面，增大其社会的效能。共同纲领中所主张的“厉行精简节约”，也可以借着货物税的征课，发挥其一部分的作用，这是二。货物税的征课，直接可以影响消费，间接即可以影响生产。对于非必需品课税或重税之后，减少了消费，因而减少生产或是降低其生产的利润，结果可便非必需品的私营企业，渐趋收缩，将资本与劳力，转移于有益的方向，则对于经济建设，必可发生良好的影响。共同纲领中规定国营经济对于私营经济要发生领导的作用，同时，合理运用财政政策中的租税政策，亦可发挥领导私营经济的影响，这是三。现行货物税，以本年九月二十一日颁布的华北区货物税暂行条例为例，征收货物税的税目，计有十六类，包括甚广。但是我们要知道：在人民政府领导之下，不仅将征课的税类，统一起来，而且将稽征的机构统一起来！一个货物税法之外，不再有五花八门支离破碎的变相货物税。一个系统的税务局之外，不再有又是中央又是地方分歧对立一国三公的征收机关。总结起来，现在货物税的征课，较之过去时代，实已大大的简化。而且，税目虽多，但是对于必需品，非必需品，以及奢侈品，分别得很仔细。税率的轻重，莫不比照货物的性质，详细区分。从最低税率——麦粉从价征收百分之二·五到最高税率——机制卷烟从价征收百分之一百，这对于左右消费领导生产的经济作用，和对于增加收入汇集余资的财政作用，以及顾虑生活促进节约的社会作用，均能兼筹并顾，这是四。

    货物税属于间接税的一种，那么今天所行的货物税，对于直接税的比重，究竟该怎样才算合理呢？按照资产阶级的财政理论如同英美所流行的一套，以及抗战开始后解放胜利前各方所主张的偏重直接税的说法，不免将货物税的比重压低，这在英美那样社会和解放前的中国，亦不无一部分的理由。但在大解放以后的今日，还要援引英美式的租税理论，或是沿袭解放前的流行说法，不用说，是根本错误，就是马上效法苏联，欲将直接税作到无足轻重，也是躐等欲速。因为在新民主主义的经济体系之下，私营经济所占的成分尚多，较之苏联已经走到社会主义经济者不同，我们就不能不运用直接税尤其是工商税，使私营经济对于国家财政，分担其合理的税负。所以我们对于直接税的征课，还要期其应有的发展。私营经济能够发展，反映在税收上，还不就是直接税的发展么？但是这个发展，在新民主主义的经济体系之下，是有其限度的。因为私营经济的利润，不能为无限度的增殖，超过一定限度而近于垄断的利润时，那是共同纲领所绝对不许的。打算从逾量的私营利润，取得庞大的直接税收，在新民主主义之下，是不应该而且是不可能的，所以直接税在今日，虽有其存在和发展的余地，但是它的比重，总要次于货物税。而况战争之后，喘息方苏，私营工商业不能马上获得充足的利润，以提高其生产力，那么工商税的税率，不仅不能提高，且须酌予降低，对工业课税又须较低于商业课税，而工业课税之中，又须区别性质，优予减免，为这样一来，对于工商税税收的估计，就不能跻于货物税之上了。自然，工商业得遂其合理的发展，就是用低税率，也可以增加收入，发挥租税的弹力。但在整个税收的比重上，总不免，而且应该列在货物税的次位，两相补充，以贯彻整个的财经政策。
