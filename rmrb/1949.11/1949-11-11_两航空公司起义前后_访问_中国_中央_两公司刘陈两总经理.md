    Before and After the Two Airlines' Uprising
    ——Visiting General Managers Liu and Chen of "China" and "Central" Airlines

    In a quiet room, suitcases, luggage, and bamboo baskets filled with apples were placed on the carpet. These items all had thick, stiff paper tags with the words "To Taipei" written on them. Twenty-four hours earlier, these items were still at Kai Tak Airport in Hong Kong, thousands of miles away. At 6:30 a.m. on November 9th, a "flying palace" carrying the managers and employees of the two airlines to Taipei took five hours and thirty-three minutes, safely landing in the people's capital at 12:01 p.m. On that day, the "China" and "Central" airlines in Hong Kong were "operating" as usual, with flights to Taipei, Chongqing, and Kunming; all were inspected by Hong Kong customs. However, just before takeoff, the company told passengers: the aircraft bound for Taipei had a parts malfunction, and the weather was unsuitable for Chongqing. … The passengers left one after another; the managers and employees of the two airlines, however, took the cars meant for passengers from the Peninsula Hotel to the airport, boarded the twelve planes scheduled to fly to the motherland at the same time, and quietly left Hong Kong.
    "We can all breathe a sigh of relief now," General Manager Liu Jingyi said lightly, as he unwrapped a telegram from Zhao Jitang, the director of the China Aircraft Factory in Shanghai: "Boundless admiration, special telegram to congratulate!" Li Xingwu, the manager of Eurasia Aviation Corporation from Shanghai, sitting beside him, quickly said: "Colleagues in Shanghai are all happy for your righteous act." Recently, the Kuomintang bandit gang wanted to force the two Hong Kong airlines to move to Taiwan, attempting to continue to destroy the people's aviation industry. Recalling the tragic scene of the two companies moving from Shanghai to Hong Kong, Manager Liu couldn't help but curse: "The civil aviation that has been operating for so many years, the Chinese people will never allow them to continue to ruin it." Two or three months ago, the employees of the two airlines, in the spirit of protecting the property of the people of the motherland, organized around the trade union to jointly carry out the work of returning to the people's motherland. After obtaining the consent of General Managers Liu and Chen, all four thousand employees declared an uprising, breaking away from the Kuomintang reactionaries, accepting the leadership of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, and announcing the cessation of flights to the Chiang bandit areas. All personnel and equipment will be gradually transported back to the country to serve the people. Currently, there are still over seventy aircraft left in Hong Kong, including the Sky Master, Sky King, C.46, P.33, DC.3, C.47, and seaplanes, as well as the aircraft repair factories of "China" and "Central" airlines. Managers Liu and Chen said: The aircraft repair factory at Kai Tak Airport in Hong Kong covers an area of more than 140,000 square meters and was built with the property of the Chinese people. A few months ago, the Hong Kong government unreasonably requisitioned most of the factory, leaving only an area of more than 10,000 square meters for the two companies to use. The Kuomintang bandit gang could not question this unreasonable behavior in front of British imperialism. Now, the aviation employees in Hong Kong have organized, and they will not allow the slightest damage to the property of the people's motherland. The repair factory left in Hong Kong is estimated to be worth 40 million US dollars, and its parts, electroplating, sheet metal, machine repair, propeller, machine, engine repair, and other factories are well-equipped and are the best aircraft repair factories in China. The employees of the two airlines firmly stated: these sacred property rights of the Chinese people must be respected by the Hong Kong authorities. It is estimated that the reactionaries will definitely conspire to sabotage these properties, but the employees left in Hong Kong will definitely overcome conspiracies and intimidation from any side.
    Managers Liu and Chen, who had just emerged from the shackles of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, were extremely excited. They said: "Now that we have returned to the motherland, the development of our country's civil aviation will no longer be obstructed." It is said that the employees remaining in Hong Kong are very enthusiastic, hoping that the people's aviation industry will develop quickly, and they are very willing to "return home to build the people's civil aviation industry." In the Kuomintang bandit-controlled areas, imperialists can do whatever they want. Manager Liu especially mentioned the crimes of the American rogue Chennault. Chennault, under the pretext of transporting "relief supplies" from the "Relief Administration," signed a "contract" with the Kuomintang bandit gang, and smuggled a large amount of private goods in Shanghai and Guangzhou, depriving the Chinese people of their interests. Guangzhou Tianhe Airport and Shanghai Hongqiao Airport had no customs, and the Kuomintang post office colluded with Chennault, they smuggled goods in postal packages, and carried private goods by various despicable methods, all of which were unchecked and tax-free. Now Chennault has slipped to Hainan Island, refusing to set up customs at his airport in order to continue his shameless speculation. He is a big rogue, an enemy of the Chinese people, and he still wants to help the Kuomintang bandit gang slaughter the Chinese people, the Chinese people must punish him.
    The two airlines have few planes left in the Chiang bandit area. Only four were left in Chongqing, and there was not a single aircraft belonging to "China" and "Central" airlines in Taiwan, Kunming, or Guilin. The two managers happily told me: The Kuomintang bandit gang's transportation has collapsed, and the highways and railways have almost all returned to the hands of the people, and what remains is dilapidated. Their only escape route today is air transport, and since November 9th, in this regard, they have also collapsed. The Kuomintang bandit gang once sent a telegram to Manager Liu, asking him to go to Chongqing to help build an airport. Manager Liu laughed and said, "From Shanghai to Hong Kong was dark, painful, and without a future enough; should I go to that dead end? Truly laughable." A small group of Kuomintang bandits remaining in the Southwest are scattering like birds and beasts. A few days ago, the bandit gang notified the two Hong Kong airlines to send three planes to Chongqing to transport those heinous enemies of the people to South America to be "White Chinese." However, the bandits' dream cannot be realized.
    The uprising of the employees of "China" and "Central" airlines has been warmly welcomed by the Chinese people, and they are determined to work hard for the people's aviation industry under the correct leadership of the Central People's Government and Chairman Mao. I saw the three aircraft models they brought from Hong Kong, two of which were Sky Masters. I thought that China's civil aviation industry has begun to grow. As long as the national aviation personnel unite and study hard, the new China's air transport network will soon be filled. (Attached picture)

    两航空公司起义前后
    ——访问“中国”“中央”两公司刘陈两总经理
    陈迹
    在一间清静的楼房里，地毡上放着皮箱、行李和装有苹果的竹篓。这些东西都挂有厚硬的纸条，写着“往台北”的字样。二十四小时以前，这些东西还放在数千里外的香港启德机场上。十一月九日清晨六点半钟，一只载着两公司经理和员工飞往台北的“空中行宫”机，经过了五点三刻的时间，于十二时一刻安全降落到人民的首都。香港“中国”“中央”两航空公司在那一天照常“营业”，班机有到台北的，有到重庆和昆明的；还都经过了香港海关的检查。但是，在快要起飞的时候，公司方面告诉旅客：往台北的飞机零件发生故障，去重庆的气候不适。……旅客们都陆续离开了；两公司经理和员工却从半岛酒店搭上给旅客坐的汽车到了机场，坐上了相约同一时间飞往祖国的十二架飞机，安安静静地离开了香港。
    “我们都能吐吐气了。”刘敬宜总经理轻松地说了这一句话，拆看着上海中国飞机厂长赵际唐给他们的电报：“佩仰无量，特电致贺！”坐在一旁的从上海来的欧亚航空公司李星五经理连忙地说：“上海同仁都为你们的义举而高兴。”最近国民党匪帮要逼迫香港两航空公司搬往台湾，企图继续摧残人民的航空事业。刘经理回忆起两公司从上海搬到香港的那幅惨象，不由地骂道：“经营了好多年的民用航空，中国人民决不允许他们继续糟蹋了。”在两三个月以前，两航空公司的员工们本着爱护祖国人民财产的精神，组织在职工会的周围，共同分头进行返回人民祖国的工作。在取得了刘陈两总经理的同意之后，全体员工四千余人即宣布起义，脱离国民党反动派，接受中华人民共和国中央人民政府的领导；并宣布停止通航蒋匪区域，所有人员器材即将逐步运回国内，以为人民服务。现在留在香港的飞机还有空中霸王号、天王号、Ｃ.４６、Ｐ.３３，ＤＣ.３、Ｃ.４７及水上飞船机等七十余架，和“中国”“中央”两航空公司的飞机修理厂。刘陈两经理说：飞机修理厂在香港的启德机场，面积广达十四万多平方公尺，是用中国人民的财产修建起来的。几个月前，香港政府无理地征用了该厂的大部分，仅留下一万多平方公尺的范围给两公司使用。这种无理行为，国民党匪帮在英帝国主义面前是不能过问的。现在香港的航空员工已经组织起来了，他们决不容许人民祖国财产有丝毫的损害。两公司留港的修理厂估计价值四千万美金，其零件、电镀、白铁、机器修理、螺旋、机器、发动机修理等厂，设备精良，为中国最好的飞机修理厂。两航空公司员工们都坚决表示：这些中国人民的神圣产权，必须受到香港当局的尊重。估计反动派一定要阴谋破坏这些财产，但是留港的员工们一定会战胜来自任何方面的阴谋恫吓的。
    刚刚从帝国主义及国民党反动派束缚下走出来的刘陈两经理，情绪极为振奋。他们说：“现在我们回到祖国了，今后我国民用航空的发展再也不会遭到阻碍了。”据称：留在香港的员工们情绪都非常热烈，盼望人民的航空事业快快地开展起来，他们是万分愿意“回家来建设人民民用航空事业”的。在国民党匪帮统治区，帝国主义者是可以为所欲为的。刘经理特别提到美国流氓陈纳德的罪行。陈纳德假借载运“救济总署”的“救济物资”之名，和国民党匪帮订立了个“合同”，在上海、在广州，大量偷运私货，剥夺中国人民的利益。广州天河机场和上海虹桥机场都没有海关，国民党的邮局又和陈纳德勾结着，他们以邮包偷运物资，用各种卑鄙的方法挟带私货，都是不受检查，不交税的。现在陈纳德溜到海南岛去，拒绝在他的机场设立海关，以便继续干那无耻的投机勾当。他是一个大流氓，是中国人民的敌人，他还要想帮助国民党匪帮残杀中国人民，中国人民一定要惩办他的。
    两航空公司留在蒋匪区的飞机没有几架了。在重庆只留下了四架，至于台湾、昆明、桂林没有一架飞机是“中国”“中央”两航空公司的。两个经理高兴地告诉我：国民党匪帮的交通已经垮台了，公路，铁路几乎全部都回到了人民手中，所剩的都残破不堪了。他们今天唯一的逃路就是空运，自从十一月九日起，在这方面，他们也垮了。国民党匪帮曾经打电报给刘经理，要他去重庆，帮助修建飞机场。刘经理笑道：“从上海到香港，已够黑暗、痛苦和没有前途了；还去那个死路吗？真真笑话。”留在西南的一小撮国民党匪帮，正在作鸟兽散，前些日子，匪帮曾通知香港两航空公司派三架飞机去重庆，运送那些恶贯满盈的人民公敌到南美洲当“白华”。然而匪帮们的这个梦想是无法实现了。
    “中国”“中央”两航空公司员工的起义，受到了中国人民的热烈欢迎，他们决心在中央人民政府和毛主席的正确领导下，为人民航空事业而努力。我看到了他们从香港带来的三架飞机模型，其中两架是空中霸王号。我想到中国人民航空事业已经开始生长起来了。只要全国航空人员团结起来，努力学习，新中国的空运网不会有多久就要满布起来的。（附图片）
