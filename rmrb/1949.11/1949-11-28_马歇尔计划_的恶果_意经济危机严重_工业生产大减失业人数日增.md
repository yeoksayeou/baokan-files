Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 26th -- Tass, Rome dispatches: The economic crisis in Marshallized Italy is becoming increasingly serious. Industrial production is being further reduced. According to estimates by the Italian Central Bureau of Statistics, industrial production in August fell by 16.1 percent compared with July, of which the processing industry fell by 18.3 percent and the power generation industry fell by 11.6 percent. According to statistics published by "Finsider," in the first nine months of this year, Italy's steel production decreased by 10.1 percent compared with the same period last year. According to official statistics published by the Ministry of Labor, in September and October, 8 percent of Italian enterprises were idle, with particularly high percentages of idleness in the following industries: the mining industry accounting for 25 percent, the food industry accounting for 10 percent, and the textile industry accounting for 12 percent. The increasing idleness of enterprises has led to an increase in the number of semi-unemployed workers. According to the same statistics from the Ministry of Labor, 22.6 percent of Italian workers work less than 40 hours per week. Milan's economic newspaper "24 Ore" estimates that cotton industry employees even work an average of only 24 to 30 hours per week. The worsening economic situation in Italy has forced the mouthpiece of the industrialists' association - the reactionary Il Globo newspaper - to admit that the "difficulties" of industry and commerce are causing great panic in "Italian economic circles." The newspaper admits that in the year since the implementation of the Marshall Plan, Italian industrial production has fallen sharply. Steel production has fallen by 18 percent, and power generation has fallen by 19 percent.

The situation in Italian agricultural production is also deteriorating. Even the reactionary landlords' organization - the Italian Landowners' Union - admitted in a recent communique that, as a result of the De Gasperi government's implementation of reactionary economic policies and the competition of American goods in domestic and foreign markets, "Italian agricultural producers are currently in a precarious state."

　　“马歇尔计划”的恶果
    意经济危机严重
  　工业生产大减失业人数日增
    【新华社北京二十六日电】综合塔斯社罗马消息：马歇尔化意大利的经济危机，正日趋严重。工业生产正进一步削减中。据意大利中央统计局估计，八月份的工业生产与七月份比较，业已下降百分之十六点一，其中，加工工业下降百分之十八点三，发电工业下降百分之十一点六。根据“芬西德”公司所发表的统计，在本年前九个月，意大利钢的生产量较去年同一时期下降百分之十点一。又据劳工部发表的官方统计称：在九、十两个月内，百分之八的意大利企业空闲着，其中空闲百分比特别大的有下列工业：采矿工业占百分之二十五，食品工业占百分之十，纺织业占百分之十二。随着企业空闲而来的是半失业工人人数的增加。根据劳工部的同一统计，有百分之二十二点六的意大利工人，每周的工作不到四十小时。米兰的经济新闻“二十四小时”估计，棉花工业的职工，甚至每周平均工作的时间已少到二十四小时至三十小时。意大利经济情势的日趋恶化，使得工业家联合会的喉舌——反动的环球报，也不得不承认工商业的“困难”对“意大利经济界”是非常恐慌的。该报承认：在马歇尔计划实施的一年当中，意大利工业产量急剧下跌。钢铁产量已下降百分之十八，发电量已下降百分之十九。
    意大利农业生产的情况也日益恶化。甚至反动的地主组织——意大利地主联合会在最近发表的公报中，也承认由于加斯贝利政府实施反动的经济政策，及美货在国内外市场上竞争的结果，“意大利农业生产者目前正处于危殆状态中”。
