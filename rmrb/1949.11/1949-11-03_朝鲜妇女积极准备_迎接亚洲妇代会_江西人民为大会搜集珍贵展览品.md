Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 2nd. The women of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea are preparing in all aspects to welcome the Asian Women's Representative Conference to be held in Beijing. The preparatory committee, headed by Park Chung-ae, Chairman of the North Korean Democratic Women's League, and Liu Ying-jun, Chairman of the South Korean Women's League, has held two meetings to discuss various preparations. According to the instructions of the preparatory committee, women's federations at all levels have carried out extensive publicity on the political significance of the Asian Women's Representative Conference among women of all strata. Following the oath taken by female workers of the Hamhung Textile Factory to not only complete but also exceed the planned target for this year by 135%, female workers in various factories in North Korea have launched a production competition. In order to introduce to Asian women the heroic posture of Korean women in North Korea in the construction of production, culture, and politics in the four years after liberation, and in the struggle for national salvation in South Korea, they are preparing a rich exhibition. In addition, the Korean delegation attending the conference will lead a Korean women's art performance team to Beijing to celebrate the opening of the conference.
