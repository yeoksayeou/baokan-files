　　Yan University Faculty and Students Unanimously Support the Government Administration Council's Decision
　　——An Interview with Mr. Lu Zhiwei
　　Pu Xixiu
　　"We, the entire faculty and student body, unanimously support Vice Premier Guo Moruo's report to the Government Administration Council on the policy for handling cultural, educational, and relief organizations and religious groups receiving American subsidies, as well as the decisions of the Government Administration Council meeting." Yan University sent such a concise and clear official document to the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government on January 6th. The faculty and students of Yan University were particularly pleased to see the Government Administration Council's decision. They felt that not only would it eliminate American imperialist cultural aggression and get rid of the "John Leighton Stuart" burden, but also that the university could be run by the Chinese themselves from now on.

　　Mr. Lu Zhiwei told me, "The influence of American imperialist cultural aggression in universities has created pro-American and worshipful attitudes towards the United States in some people, leading a segment to become infatuated with the American way of life. John Leighton Stuart, with his long-term, far-reaching kite-flying approach, further blurred the thinking of some. Since the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, many people have thoroughly recognized the hideous face of American imperialism. This decision of the Government Administration Council will thoroughly eliminate the influence of American imperialist cultural aggression and reshape our education system."

　　Mr. Lu Zhiwei also painfully recalled the scene of the Kuomintang secret agents searching Yan University on August 19, 1948: "At that time, the Kuomintang secret agents, with an aggressive air, held a list and demanded that I hand over the students. I negotiated while helping the students on the list to hide." This painful fact reminded Mr. Lu of two other things. He had been unwilling to continue bearing the responsibility for Yan University's affairs after 1947 and resigned from his position as acting president of Yan University because the U.S. State Department had passed a resolution requiring unified control of church-run schools in China. He believed this was a further manifestation of American cultural aggression against China, and that school affairs would become difficult to handle. During his absence, the school affairs of Yan University were managed by the American, Adolphe. During Adolphe's tenure, two things aroused the anger and resistance of the entire faculty and student body. One was that Adolphe, believing that Yan University's treatment was already very good, withheld two bags of flour per person that the then-puppet municipal government had allocated to the faculty and staff of Yan University. The other was during the anti-hunger movement. Adolphe closed the school gates and did not allow students participating in the parade to return to school. Mr. Lu, seeing that Yan University would be unmanageable if things continued this way, resumed his duties on August 1, 1948. He had just taken over on August 1st, and on August 19th, the Kuomintang secret agent search occurred. If Yan University had still been under Adolphe's leadership that day, the students would undoubtedly have suffered severe oppression. This shows how American imperialism colluded with the reactionaries to suppress the Chinese people.

　　The faculty and students of the Theological Seminary attached to Yan University were also very pleased to hear the Government Administration Council's decision. They had long enthusiastically participated in the Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda work. They believe that developing their religious undertakings under the principles of self-governance, self-support, and self-propagation is the best thing.

　　Cultural and educational institutions and religious organizations that have received American subsidies will receive better development under the leadership of the People's Government after severing ties with American imperialism. Mr. Lu Zhiwei said, "Yan University will develop according to its own plan in the future, and hopes that it can become one of the best universities in the country."

　　燕大师生一致拥护政务院决定
    ——访陆志韦先生
    浦熙修
    “对于郭沫若副总理在政务院关于处理接受美国津贴的文化教育、救济机关及宗教团体的方针的报告与政务会议的决定，我们全体师生一致拥护。”燕京大学曾以这样简洁明白的公文于一月六日送到了中央人民政府教育部。燕大师生看见了政务院的决定特别感到高兴。因为他们觉得不但从此肃清了美帝对我的文化侵略，丢掉了“司徒雷登”这个大包袱，并且学校可以从此由中国人自办了。
    陆志韦先生告诉我说：“美帝文化侵略在大学中的影响，造成了有些人崇美、亲美的思想，使一部分人迷恋着美国的生活方式。司徒雷登用长线放远鹞的方式，曾使有些人的思想更加模糊起来。自抗美援朝运动以来，许多人才彻底地把美帝的狰狞面目认识清楚。这次政务院的决定，必能彻底肃清美帝文化侵略的影响，而重新改造我们的教育制度。”
    陆志韦先生又痛苦地回忆起一九四八年八月十九日蒋匪特务搜查燕大的一幕情景：“那时蒋匪特务气势汹汹地拿着名单要我交学生，我一面交涉，一面让名单上的学生躲开。”这惨痛的事实，使陆先生联想到另外两件事。他一九四七年后就不愿再担负燕大的校务而辞掉燕大代理校长职务的。因为那时美国国务院通过了在华教会学校须联合统一支配的决定。他认为这是美国对华文化侵略的进一步的表现，以后学校的事务将不好办理。在他离职期间，燕大的校务就由美国人爱道尔夫负责。在爱道尔夫负责期间有两件事引起了全体师生的愤怒与反抗。一件是爱道尔夫以燕大的待遇已经很高，他扣留了那时的伪市政府拨给燕大教职员工的每人两袋面粉。另一件是在反饥饿运动中。爱道尔夫关起了校门不许参加游行的学生返校。陆先生眼看着燕大如此下去将不可收拾，于是在一九四八年八月一日才重新任事。八月一日刚接事，八月十九日就发生了蒋匪特务搜查的事。假如那天燕大还在爱道尔夫主持之下，学生们无疑地将遭受到严重的摧残。这说明美帝是怎样与反动派串通一气来镇压中国人民的。
    附设在燕大里面的神学院全体师生听见了政务院的决定也非常高兴。他们早就热烈地参加了抗美援朝的宣传工作。他们认为在自治、自养、自传的方针下来发展他们的宗教事业是再好不过的事。
    曾受过美帝津贴的文化教育机关及宗教团体和美帝割断联系后，在人民政府领导之下将得到更好的发展。陆志韦先生说：“燕大今后将按照着自己的计划发展，希望它能够成为全国最好的大学之一。”
