　　Introducing Current Affairs Education Activities of the Beijing Young Pioneers
    Zheng Yan
    In the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and protect our homes and defend the country, Young Pioneer teams across the country, under the leadership of the Communist Youth League, have launched current affairs education activities to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, achieving certain results. To better continue patriotic ideological education, we are introducing the relevant experience of the Beijing Young Pioneer team in this area to Young Pioneer workers and counselors nationwide for reference.

    The thinking of young children is relatively simple, and they are easily influenced by family and social opinions. In the past, they believed that the United States was rich, and in games, some children were willing to be American soldiers because they thought American soldiers were very impressive. At the beginning of the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, some children often asked teachers: "The United States gave us relief flour to eat, why do you say the United States is bad?" "Why are we helping the Korean bastards?" "Are atomic bombs scary?" A few team members were even influenced by rumors and were unwilling to wear their red scarves to school.

    To educate young children, we must first raise teachers' awareness of the current situation. Therefore, the Youth League Beijing Municipal Committee's Young Pioneer Department cooperated with educational administration to launch a warm current affairs study movement among primary school teachers. Through the League organization, they organized many teacher accusation meetings. Teachers accused the impoverished economic life and humble political treatment they experienced during the enemy-puppet period and under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. Some teachers passionately declared at the accusation meeting: "Imperialists are all wolves in sheep's clothing. Without the motherland, we would lose our guarantee. I must educate the children well and make them hate American imperialism and love their motherland!" These accusation meetings enlightened the teachers' political awareness, and most of the teachers actively and voluntarily studied current affairs and enthusiastically educated the children. Through stories or vivid facts, they told the children about the atrocities of American imperialism and its ambition to invade Korea and China; the relationship between China and North Korea being as close as lips and teeth, and the historical friendship of the two peoples fighting side by side; American imperialism being a paper tiger, and the strength of the peace camp, so that the children understood why it was necessary to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. Many schools and team headquarters organized children to watch "They Have a Motherland," a film that provided very powerful education on loving the motherland.

    The Young Pioneer teams cooperated with the school's current affairs education and launched various activities. The team members collected materials themselves, held story sessions about the atrocities of the U.S. military, cartoon and new poetry exhibitions, and drama evenings to portray the crimes of U.S. imperialism and the heroic struggle of the Chinese and Korean people. Middle school team members also participated in street propaganda work. Through these educations, children generally began to hate American imperialism and sympathize with the just war of the Korean people. On this ideological basis, the counselors created a military game, which became one of the most beloved activities of young children. The young children carried military sticks, wooden guns, held red flags (team flags), bugles, and used firecrackers and cannons to attack bunkers and shoot down enemy planes. After occupying the enemy's positions, the team members searched for MacArthur, Syngman Rhee, and other war criminals, captives, and spoils of war (replaced with pieces of paper), and held victory celebrations. Battle heroes, wearing big red flowers, triumphantly returned amidst shouts of "Long live the Chinese People's Volunteer Army!" "Long live the Korean People's Army!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live General Kim Il-sung!" Through this game, the young children felt infinite warmth toward the just actions of our volunteer army in aiding the Korean people. They said, "It would be great if it were real, I would definitely capture a few more prisoners!"

    The counselors of Baojia Street Primary School created a novel activity method. The entire activity was strung together with a recitation poem, interspersed with many short programs illustrating the richness and magnificence of the motherland and the history of the people's heroic struggles. The name of this team day was: "Motherland, I Love You!" The children decorated the venue with many landscape paintings and photographs, making the venue very solemn and beautiful. Under the portrait of Chairman Mao, there was a piece of paper with the five red characters "Motherland, I Love You!" The children filled that piece of paper with their signatures. Two Young Pioneer team members wearing red scarves read poems praising the motherland in clear and loud voices. They praised the beauty and grandeur of the motherland's mountains and rivers, and praised the abundance of the motherland's products. The children's eyes followed the hands of the two team members as they moved on the map, their eyes filled with happy radiance. But the reciter then said: "Our motherland is so lovely, but it has experienced countless hardships." Then the reciter recounted the suffering experienced by the Chinese people after the September 18th Incident and the history of the Chinese people's heroic struggles. He recited how the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao led the Chinese people to achieve liberation, recited the free and happy lives of the children after liberation, and recited that they had their own organization - the Young Pioneer team. But American imperialism now wants to destroy the peaceful and happy lives of the Chinese people, launched the war of aggression against Korea, and continues to bomb our Northeast. In between, there were many very attractive speeches, stories, and skits for children. For example: The counselor told the children the story of many children in the Northeast who went missing after the September 18th Incident, just like in the film "They Have a Motherland." Japanese imperialism wanted to make them forget their motherland and be their slaves forever. A team member told the "Story of Little Shuanzi," which was a story of a child bravely resisting the Japanese invaders during the War of Resistance Against Japan. Some programs performed the atrocities of the U.S. and Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops after August 15th; some programs depicted American imperialism as a paper tiger.... The children were all moved to tears, and the team headquarters called on the team members and classmates to study hard, exercise, and be ready at all times to work hard for the construction of the motherland. The great and lovely image of the motherland was deeply imprinted in the children's hearts through the recitation of poetry, making them love her even more. After this activity, the children were more diligent in their studies and enthusiastically wrote letters of condolences to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army. The children put their photos in envelopes, and some drew their portraits on the letters. They gave their most beloved things to the soldiers. One team member put a newly bought copy of "How the Steel Was Tempered" in the condolence bag. She said: "The soldiers will be stronger after reading this book." The girls more carefully embroidered delicate little flowers with beautiful silk threads to decorate their condolence bags.

    To celebrate Chairman Mao's birthday (i.e., December 26, 1893), some schools, such as Shuncheng Street Primary School and Baojia Street Primary School, held gatherings of "Respecting Dear Chairman Mao" and "Being Good Students of Chairman Mao." The team members collected Chairman Mao's photos, plaster statues, paintings, and works, and arranged a small exhibition room. In this exhibition room, they held gatherings where team members and counselors told stories about Chairman Mao; told about his youth; and told about his leadership in the Chinese revolutionary struggle. The team members sang songs praising Chairman Mao and told about their aspirations to be good students of Mao Zedong when they grew up. One team member held a picture of an ideal building, with a beautiful school building drawn on it. He said: "I want to learn from Chairman Mao's great spirit of serving the people wholeheartedly. When I grow up, I want to be an engineer and build countless spacious and beautiful school buildings for future primary school students." They presented these childhood ideals to Chairman Mao as gifts to celebrate his birthday.

    There are many other team day activities, all carried out with the themes of "The Chinese and Korean People are Brothers," "Our Motherland Cannot Be Invaded Again," and "What Will I Do When I Grow Up?" Through these lively patriotic and internationalist educations, the children's thoughts of hating American imperialism, loving the motherland, and loving Chairman Mao are constantly growing. When the children of the Second District Central Primary School celebrated team day, they were now unwilling to play American soldiers. Only after the counselors repeatedly persuaded them did they accept the task. They then tried to portray the American soldiers as very ugly and afraid of death. The Young Pioneer team of Yucai Middle School called on the students to save more than one million snacks money, and entrusted the Beijing Municipal and Dafenhui to buy a "Yucai Middle School Assault Rifle" to present to General Kim Il-sung, and asked him to forward it to the most heroic battle hero in Korea. The team members also attached a red scarf and asked this battle hero to be their honorary team member.

    These thoughts are also reflected in the three or four hundred solicited articles hosted by the Beijing Young Pioneers, with the theme of "What Will I Do When I Grow Up?" From these articles, one can see the mental outlook of ordinary children in Beijing. The children are determined to be naval, air force and artillery soldiers when they grow up, especially wanting to be sailors. Some want to be engineers, tractor drivers, agriculturalists, writers, musicians.... These childhood fantasies are full of enthusiasm for defending and building the motherland. Li Hongzhu, a team member of Baojia Street Primary School, wrote: "When I open the map, I see such a large area of ​​blue sea in the southeast of our country, which needs a strong navy to protect it. I love my motherland, I want to be an unyielding steel warrior when I grow up. If the invaders dare to invade us, I will fight them to the death!"

    Experience shows that as long as we carry out ideological education appropriately, we can cultivate new ideas and good qualities in children. In addition to classes, we should also carry it out through team activities. To do this work well, Young Pioneer workers, counselors and teachers themselves must step up their studies, enrich their knowledge, and cultivate their patriotic and internationalist ideological qualities, so that they can use the new things of New China to educate young children and create ideological activities that they love.

　　介绍北京市少年儿童队的时事教育活动
    郑延
    在抗美援朝保家卫国运动中，全国各地少年儿童队在青年团领导下，都展开了抗美援朝的时事教育活动，获得了一定的成绩。为了更好地继续开展爱国主义的思想教育，特将北京市少年儿童队有关这方面的活动经验，介绍给全国少年儿童工作者及辅导员们作参考。
    少年儿童的思想是比较单纯的，容易接受家庭、社会舆论的影响。过去他们认为美国是富有的，在游戏中有的儿童愿意当美国兵，因为他觉得美国兵很神气。在抗美援朝运动刚开始的时候，有些儿童常常问老师：“美国给我们救济面粉吃，为什么说美国不好呢？”“为什么援助高丽棒子呢？”“原子弹可怕吗？”甚至有少数队员受了谣言的影响，不愿意带着红领巾上学。
    要教育少年儿童，首先必须提高教师对时局的认识，因此青年团北京市委员会少年儿童部配合教育行政，在小学教师中展开了热烈的时事学习运动。他们通过团的组织，组织了许多教师控诉会，教师们控诉在敌伪时期与在国民党反动统治时期贫困的经济生活和卑微的政治待遇。有的教师在控诉会上激愤地宣誓：“帝国主义都是狼心狗肺的，如果没有祖国，就失去了保障，我一定要好好地教育孩子们，让他们仇视美帝国主义，热爱自己的祖国！”这些控诉会启发了教师们的政治觉悟，大多数的教师都积极主动地学习时事并热情地对儿童们进行教育，他们通过故事或比较生动的事实，告诉儿童们美帝国主义的暴行和侵略朝鲜、中国的野心；中朝两国的唇齿关系及两国人民并肩作战的历史友谊；美帝国主义是纸老虎及和平阵营的强大力量，使儿童们懂得了为什么要抗美援朝。许多学校和队部组织儿童们看“他们有祖国”，这部电影对儿童们进行了极有力的爱祖国的教育。
    少年儿童队配合了学校的时事教育展开了各种活动。队员们自己收集材料，开美军暴行故事会，漫画新诗展览会、戏剧晚会，来表现美帝的罪行和中朝人民的英勇斗争，中学的队员们并参加了街头的宣传工作。经过这些教育，儿童们普遍地开始仇恨美帝国主义和同情朝鲜人民的正义战争。在这样的思想基础上，辅导员们创造了一种军事游戏，这种游戏成为少年儿童们最热爱的一种活动。少年儿童们肩荷军棍、木枪、手执红旗（队旗）、军号，用炮竹，炸炮攻打碉堡，射击敌机。在占领敌人阵地以后，队员们搜索麦克阿瑟、李承晚等战犯、俘虏及战利品（用纸片代替的），并举行庆功大会。战斗英雄们胸带大红花，在高呼“中国人民志愿军万岁！”“朝鲜人民军万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”“金日成将军万岁！”等口号声中，凯旋而归。通过这种游戏，使少年儿童们对于我国志愿军援助朝鲜人民的正义行动，感到无限的亲切。他们说：“要是真的多好，我一定要多抓几个俘虏！”。
    鲍家街小学的辅导员们创造了一种新颖的活动方式。整个的活动是用一首朗诵诗来贯串的，中间穿插许多短小的节目，说明祖国的富饶壮丽和人民英勇斗争的历史，这个队日的名字叫做：“祖国，我爱你！”儿童们用许多风景画和照片装饰会场，把会场布置得非常庄严美丽。在毛主席的像下，有一张纸写着“祖国，我爱你！”五个红色的大字，儿童们在那张纸上签满了自己的名字。两个带着红领巾的少年儿童队员就用清脆响亮的声音，念着赞美祖国的诗句，他们赞颂祖国山河的美丽壮阔，赞颂祖国物产的丰富。儿童们的眼睛随着两个队员的手在地图上移动，眼睛里充满了幸福的光辉。但是朗诵者接着说：“我们的祖国是这么可爱，但她却经历了无数的苦难。”接着朗诵者历述了九一八以后中国人民所遭受的苦难和中国人民英勇斗争历史。他朗诵中国共产党、毛主席领导中国人民获得了解放，朗诵解放后儿童们自由幸福的生活，朗诵他们有了自己的组织——少年儿童队。但是美帝国主义现在要来破坏中国人民和平幸福的生活，发动了侵略朝鲜的战争，并不断地轰炸我国东北。在这中间穿插了许多非常吸引儿童的讲话、故事、短剧。例如：辅导员给儿童们讲九一八以后很多东北儿童失踪的故事，像“他们有祖国”这部电影里所描写的一样。日本帝国主义要使他们忘记自己的祖国，永远做他们的奴隶，一个队员讲了“小栓子的故事”，这是在抗日战争时期一个儿童英勇反抗日寇的故事。有的节目表演八一五以后美、蒋匪军的暴行；有的节目描写美帝是一只纸老虎……。儿童们都激愤地流泪了，队部号召队员们、同学们要努力学习，锻炼身体，时刻准备着为建设祖国而努力。祖国的伟大可爱的形象，通过诗的朗诵深深地印入了儿童们的心里，使他们更加热爱她了。在这次活动以后，儿童们在学习上更踏实了，并且热烈地给中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军写慰问信。孩子们把自己的照片装在信封里，有的把自己的像画在信上面。他们把最心爱的东西赠给战士们，有一个队员把刚买的一本“钢铁是怎样炼成的”装入了慰问袋，她说：“战士们看了这本书就更刚强了。”女孩子们更细心地用美丽的丝线绣成精致的小花朵来装饰自己的慰问袋。
    为了庆祝毛主席的生日（即一八九三年十二月廿六日），有的学校如顺城街小学，鲍家街小学都举行了“敬爱毛主席”，“做毛主席的好学生”的集会。队员们分别收集毛主席的照片、石膏像、画、著作，布置了一间小小的展览室。在这间展览室里，他们举行集会，由队员和辅导员讲有关毛主席的故事；讲述他的青少年时代；讲述他领导中国革命斗争的故事。队员们歌唱赞颂毛主席的歌曲，讲述自己长大了要做一个毛泽东的好学生的志愿。有一个队员手里拿着一张理想的建筑图，上面画着一所美丽的小学校，他说：“我要学习毛主席终身为人民服务的伟大精神，我长大了要做一个工程师，给将来的小学生们建筑无数宽大美丽的校舍。”他们把这些童年的理想献给毛主席，作为祝贺毛主席生日的礼物。
    其他的队日活动还很多，都是以“中朝人民是兄弟”、“我们的祖国不能再受侵略”、“我长大了做什么？”为主题来进行的。经过这些生动活泼的爱国主义和国际主义教育，使儿童们仇恨美帝国主义、热爱祖国、热爱毛主席的思想不断地增长着。二区中心小学过队日的时候，儿童们现在都不愿意扮演美国兵了，必须辅导员再三说服，才肯接受这个任务。他们就想法把美国兵演得非常丑恶和怕死。育英中学少年儿童队号召同学节省了一百多万零食钱，托北京市和大分会买一支“育英中学少年冲锋枪”献给金日成将军，并请他转送给朝鲜最英勇的战斗英雄。队员们还附了一条红领巾，请这位战斗英雄做他们的名誉队员。
    这些思想还表现在北京少年儿童社所主持的、以“我长大了做什么？”为主题的三四百篇征文里。从这些文章里，可以看到北京市一般儿童们的思想面貌。儿童们都决心长大了做海、空军与炮兵，尤其愿意做海军。有的则愿意做工程师、拖拉机手、农业家、文学家、音乐家……。这些童年的幻想里，充满了保卫祖国，建设祖国的热情。鲍家街小学队员李洪柱写着：“我一打开地图，就看见我国东南部有那么一大片蔚蓝色的海水，需要一支强大的海军来保卫它。我爱我的祖国，我长大了要做一个宁死不屈的钢铁战士。侵略者敢来侵犯我们，我就和它拚个你死我活！”
    经验说明：只要我们适当地进行思想教育，就可以培养儿童们的新思想和优良的品质。除了上课，还应该通过队的活动来进行。要做好这一工作，少年儿童工作者、辅导员及教师们本身必须加紧学习，丰富知识，锻炼自己爱国主义和国际主义的思想品质，这样才能用新中国的新事物来教育少年儿童，并创造出为他们所喜爱的、富于思想性的活动来。
