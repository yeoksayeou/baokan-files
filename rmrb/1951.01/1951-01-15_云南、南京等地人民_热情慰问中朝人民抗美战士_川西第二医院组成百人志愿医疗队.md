Li Hongzhang, a representative of ethnic minorities in the Pu'er area, and Nong Youchang, a representative of the Black Yi people in the Wenshan area, said in their congratulatory letters to the People's Volunteers after the liberation of Seoul: We must unite more closely with our brothers from all ethnic groups, work hard in production, and make our great motherland even stronger.
