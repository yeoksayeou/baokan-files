　　A Model Military Family Member

　　To the Editors:
    I am writing to inform you of the exemplary deeds of Gu Enli, a revolutionary military family member from Guanjia Village, Majiawazi Village, 7th District, Jinzhou City.

    Gu Enli is sixty-six years old this year. His son, Gu Heng, joined the People's Liberation Army in 1945; his daughter, Fenglan, also joined the revolutionary work the year before last. Now he is the only one at home.

    Old Mr. Gu came to the Northeast from inside the customs in 1943 due to famine. After his family arrived in Jinzhou, they lived by picking coal cinders and begging for food, and life was very difficult. After the liberation of Jinzhou, the Communist Party led the people in carrying out land reform, and his family was allocated three mu, two fen, and five li of land. He said with emotion, "Even though I am old, I will make sure to cultivate the land that Chairman Mao gave me well and produce more grain."

    During the spring plowing last year, the government wanted to cultivate the land on his behalf, but he firmly refused, saying, "Although I am old and cannot help others, I must cultivate these few mu of land myself. I am very grateful and happy that the government is taking care of me like this. The happier I am, the more energy I have to work. I don't need the government to contract the cultivation for me, I must plant the land well." He ultimately did not let the government contract the cultivation for him.

    When Old Mr. Gu starts working, he is just like a young man. At the beginning of the spring plowing last year, he plowed the land once and carried all the manure he had collected to the field, applying a total of ninety-five heaps of manure. He planted one mu and five fen of sorghum, one mu and five fen of corn with beans, and the remaining land was planted with buckwheat and cabbage. He not only applied a lot of manure, but also did a better job of hoeing and weeding. He worked in the fields from dawn till dusk, cultivating the crops with six hoeings and four weedings.

    During the autumn harvest, Old Mr. Gu's three mu, two fen, and five li of land yielded a total of two shi and six dou of sorghum, three shi and three dou of corn, three dou of beans, one dou of buckwheat, and two thousand four hundred jin of Chinese cabbage. He said happily, "I harvested so much grain this year, and I also raised two big fat pigs and four chicks. After paying the public grain, what's left will be enough for me to eat for four years."

### 一个模范军属

　　一个模范军属编辑同志：
    我现在告诉你们锦州市七区马家洼子村关家屯革命军人家属顾恩利的模范事迹。
    顾恩利，今年六十六岁。他儿子叫顾恒，在一九四五年参加了人民解放军；他女儿凤兰，前年也参加了革命工作。现在家中只有他一个人。
    顾老大爷是一九四三年从关内逃荒到东北来的。他家到锦州以后，靠拣煤礁子和要饭过日子，生活非常困难。锦州解放后，共产党领导人民进行土地改革，他家分了三亩二分五厘地。他感动地说：“别看我岁数大了，我一定要把毛主席分给我的地耕种得好好的，多打粮食。”
    去年春耕时，政府要给他代耕，他坚决拒绝说：“虽然我岁数大了，不能帮助别人；但自己这几亩地一定得自己耕种。政府这样照顾我，我很感激，也很高兴。我心里越高兴，干活就越有劲。我不用政府给包耕，一定要把地种得好好的。”他到底没让政府给包耕。
    顾老大爷干起活来，真像年轻小伙子一样。去年春耕一开始，他就把地刨了一遍，把拾的粪也全挑到地里，一共上了九十五堆大粪。他种一亩五分地的高粱，一亩五分地的苞米带豆子，剩下的地种了荞麦和白菜。他不光是粪上得多，铲趟做的更好。他起早搭黑的在地里忙，庄稼做到了六铲四趟。
    秋收时，顾老大爷的三亩二分五厘地共收了两石六斗高粱、三石三斗苞米、三斗豆子、一斗荞麦和二千四百斤大白菜。他高兴地说：“我今年收这么多的粮，又喂了两口大肥猪和四个小鸡，交了公粮，剩下的我四年也吃不了。”
