    Guarantee Farmers a Good Spring Festival: Baoding Organizes New Year Goods for Rural Areas

    The Spring Festival is approaching. According to past practices, agricultural product prices tend to fall during this period, while New Year goods prices rise, putting farmers at a great disadvantage. To protect farmers' interests and ensure they have a good Spring Festival, the Hebei Branch of the People's Bank of China and our Baoding Prefectural Office, under the direction of the Baoding Area Financial and Economic Committee, have issued commercial loans for New Year goods, organizing merchants to bring goods to the countryside to solve the difficulty of purchasing New Year goods for farmers in remote villages far from towns. The specific measures are:
    1.  Each county bank in the area uses 54.77% of the total loan funds to lend to the county supply and marketing cooperatives, which purchase items such as white flour, salt, cloth, and kerosene, and sell them to farmers at prices lower than the market price.
    2.  Hold forums for merchants, mobilize and organize private merchants to carry various New Year goods to the countryside, and sell them to farmers in disaster areas and remote villages at medium market prices. To protect the interests of both farmers and merchants, the bank uses 20.75% of the total loan funds to lend to organized merchants going to the countryside.
    3.  The Hebei Branch of the People's Bank of China uses import and export mortgage methods to organize public and private businesses to transport farmers' local products out, and transport various New Year goods back from other places. In addition to the above measures, the bank closely cooperates with grain, cotton yarn, and local product companies, and takes on the responsibility of stabilizing finance and prices in accordance with the spirit instructed by the Baoding Area Financial and Economic Committee.

    Tang County Labor Model Zhen Lianshan Actively Promotes Current Affairs Propaganda

    Zhen Lianshan, our county's labor model, is sixty-three years old this year, but he does more than many young men. He has recently achieved many results in publicity and learning.
    He is from Zhongyangou Village in the Second District. During the Resist America, Aid Korea, and Defend the Homeland movement, the masses in the village generally had paralysis-inducing thoughts. Zhen Lianshan felt that he had not fulfilled his responsibilities, the propaganda work was not in-depth, and he had not kept up with the development of the situation. Therefore, in addition to publicizing and exposing the American imperialist conspiracy to the masses at any time on the streets and when "visiting homes", he also organized a reading group and established a regular current affairs propaganda system. He used blackboard newspapers and rooftop broadcasts to publicize the latest news from the newspapers to the masses every day. In one month, he personally wrote eight blackboard newspapers and broadcast five times, and took advantage of the natural occasions for the masses to rest to read the newspaper to everyone. During the New Year, he mobilized all the village cadres and students to carry out disguised publicity to the masses in the market, and he also disguised himself. In this way, through various different forms of publicity, the masses in the whole village and neighboring villages recognized that American imperialism is the deadly enemy of the Chinese people and the people of the world. In their village, the Resist America, Aid Korea movement is developing very well, and the emotions of men, women, old, and young throughout the village are very high. Zhen Lianshan is truly a model propagandist, and the broad masses support him very much. At present, he has mobilized the masses to actively carry soil and manure and participate in winter school learning. In winter school, he patiently teaches everyone abacus calculation, and now he has been selected by the masses as an abacus teacher. The more vigorously he teaches, the higher the enthusiasm of the students, and within a month, more than 40 students in the village learned three-digit addition and subtraction, and some learned multiplication and can keep more complex accounts. The masses in the whole village said in unison that old Zhen "is not only a model for eliminating pests and diseases, but also has become our village's model teacher."
    Zhongyangou Village, a remote mountain village in Tang County, has a labor model Zhen Lianshan, and both production and culture have shown new faces.

    Serious Accumulation of Funds at the State-run Jiangnan Chemical Plant in Jilin

    Our Jilin Provincial State-run Jiangnan Chemical Plant is a refining factory for oil shale oil. The main products are transformer oil and kerosene. Due to poor management, more than 200 billion (Northeast currency) has accumulated in funds over the past year. Now, even if the intermediate products and finished product storage tanks in the factory are turned upside down and sold for money, it is not enough to repay the bank loan. The reasons for the above results are mainly:
    (1) The leadership suffers from impatience in production. Originally, to produce petroleum products with high flash points and low freezing points, a dewaxing process must be carried out. However, oil shale oil contains a large amount of paraffin wax. Before the dewaxing plant was established, we were anxious to start production. As a result, because the flash point could not be increased and the freezing point could not be lowered, the quality of the transformer oil produced was too low and could not be sold, becoming the main reason for the accumulation of funds. At the same time, because the water source equipment was not completed, water was temporarily drawn from small rivers during production. After winter came, the water in the small rivers froze, and work was suspended for half a month in November. The workers sat idle and ate, which was also an unnecessary loss.
    (2) Speculative mentality is at play. Petroleum and oil shale oil are mixtures of many light and heavy fractions. These include raw materials for gasoline, kerosene, diesel, and asphalt. However, our factory believes that transformer oil is currently in short supply on the market and is highly profitable. Therefore, we specialize in the production of transformer oil, and completely ignore the other components contained in the raw materials. The yield of transformer oil to crude oil is only 10% to 20%, and even with kerosene it is less than 35%. The other 65% of the components are not treated or utilized at all. As a result, all production costs and raw material costs are calculated on the transformer oil, making the product cost surprisingly high, and becoming another reason for slow sales.
    (3) Neglecting to unite with technical personnel. Political study for technical personnel is completely left to their own devices. Some technical personnel asked the organization to organize them to study politics. The person in charge of the factory replied: "Your technical personnel have a high level of education and can read books on your own. There is no need to rely on the leadership." In this way, many ideological problems among technical personnel were not resolved in a timely manner, and enthusiasm for production was not fully utilized. After the outbreak of the Korean War, technical personnel in other factories were challenging and responding to each other in production, but they could not be mobilized in our factory. Some people even clamored to return to Guanli. The leadership only added a "not ideologically cleared" label to this, instead of adopting an attitude of uniting and educating.
    Now, the person in charge of the factory has begun to recognize these mistakes. The manager and deputy manager personally participate in technical research meetings and establish a technical management system, striving to improve quality and reduce costs in this year's production.

    Newspapers Should Be Properly Preserved

    We have seen many people casually and carelessly using the people's newspapers - whether it is the People's Daily, the Liberation Daily, the Northeast Daily, or other newspapers - to paste walls and wrap things. This is very inappropriate. Because the people's newspapers are the mouthpiece of the people. The newspapers of the Kuomintang all spread toxins to harm the broad masses of the people, speaking for feudalism, bureaucratic capitalism, and imperialism. Today's people's newspapers are closely related to the lives of our people. The Kuomintang's newspapers are harmful to the people, so it is not a pity to use them to paste walls, wrap things, or tear them up. However, newspapers that speak for the people should be well-cared for and preserved. The people's newspapers not only speak for the people, but also educate the people and are a powerful weapon for guiding various tasks. The people's newspapers record major events at home and abroad every day. The people's newspapers publish valuable and historically significant materials every day, so I suggest that everyone cherish newspapers and preserve them well.

    Can a Prison Sentence for One Party Be a Reason for Divorce? To the Editor:
    In the reply to Article 10 of the "Several Questions and Answers Concerning the Implementation of the Marriage Law" published by the Legal System Committee on June 26, it says: "If there are legitimate reasons for not being able to continue the relationship between husband and wife, a judgment granting divorce should be made; otherwise, a judgment refusing divorce can also be made." Please ask: Can a prison sentence for one party be used by the other party as a reason to request a divorce?
                                                Shen Yanghe, Zhao Xingzhen
    To Shen Yanghe and Zhao Xingzhen:
    Whether a prison sentence can be used as a reason for divorce should be determined based on the specific circumstances of each case and cannot be generalized. For example, if a person is sentenced for committing adultery, being a traitor, or committing counter-revolutionary crimes, it is reasonable for their spouse to use this as a reason to request a divorce. However, for other crimes, such as a car driver being sentenced to imprisonment for inadvertently hitting and killing a pedestrian, their spouse should not use this as a condition for divorce.

    保证农民过好春节 保定组织年货下乡
    春节将届，按照以往惯例，在这期间，农产品价格往往下跌，年货价格则反而上升，农民吃亏很大。为了维护农民利益，保证农民过好春节，中国人民银行河北省分行营业部和我们保定专区办事处，根据保定地区财政经济委员会的指示，发放了一部分年货的商业贷款，组织商人携带年货下乡，解决距离城镇较远的偏僻乡村农民购买年货的困难。具体作法是：
    一、专区各县银行以整个贷款的百分之五十四点七七的资金，贷给各县供销社，由供销社购买白面、食盐、花布、煤油等物品，低于市价售给农民。
    二、召开商人座谈会，动员与组织私商携带各种年货下乡，按照市场中等价钱卖给灾区及偏僻乡村的农民。银行为维护农民和商人双方的利益，我们拿整个贷款的百分之二十点七五的资金，贷给有组织的下乡商人。
    三、人民银行河北省分行营业部用进出口押汇方式，组织公私商业将农民的土产运出，到外埠运回各种年货。除以上办法外，银行并与粮食、花纱布、土产等公司密切结合，在保定地区财政经济委员会所指示的精神下齐一步调，切实负起稳定金融和物价的责任。

    唐县劳动模范甄连善  积极推动时事宣传
    我们县里的劳动模范甄连善，今年六十三岁了，可是，他做的事情真比青年小伙子都多。他最近在宣传和学习方面又得到了不少成绩。
    他是二区中眼沟村人，在抗美援朝保家卫国运动中，村里的群众却普遍存在着麻痹思想。甄连善觉得这是自己没负起责任，宣传工作做的不深入，没赶上形势的发展。所以，他除了自己随时在街头及“串门”时把美帝侵略阴谋向群众宣传揭露外，还组织了读报组，建立经常的时事宣传制度。把每天报纸上的新消息，利用黑板报，屋顶广播向群众宣传出去。一个月里，他自己亲自动手写了八次黑板报，广播了五次，并且趁群众休息的自然场合给大家念报。新年时，他动员了全村干部、学生，在集市上向群众化装宣传，他自己也化了装。这样，通过各种不同的形式开展宣传，使全村群众及邻村群众都认清了美帝是中国人民和世界人民的死敌。他们村里，抗美援朝运动开展得很好，全村男女老少情绪非常高。甄连善真是个模范宣传员，广大群众都很拥护他。眼前，他又动员了群众积极驮土、驮粪，参加冬学学习。在冬学里，他耐心地教大家珠算，现在被群众选为珠算教员了。他教的越带劲，学员们学的心气就越高，在一个月内，全村四十多名学员全学会了三位加减法，有的并学会了乘法，能记较复杂的账了。全村群众异口同声地说老甄“不光除病虫害他是模范，又成了咱村的模范教员”。
    唐县偏僻的山沟小村庄——中眼沟村，有了劳模甄连善，生产、文化都显出了新的面目。

    吉林公营江南化工厂  积压资金现象严重
    我们吉林省营江南化工厂是一个油母页岩油的精制工厂。主要产品是变压器油和火油。由于经营不善，一年来积压资金两千多亿（东北币）。现在就算把厂里的中间制品与成品贮槽翻个底朝天拿出来卖成钱，也不够还银行的贷款。造成上述结果的原因，主要是：
    （一）领导对生产患了急性病。本来，要生产引火点高、凝固点低的石油制品，必须经过脱腊过程。而油母页岩油中含有大量的石腊成分。但我们在脱腊工厂没有建立起来以前，就急于开工生产。结果因引火点无法提高，凝固点无法降低，生产出来的变压器油质量太低，卖不出去，成为积压资金的主要原因。同时，由于水源设备没有完成，生产时临时吸取小河沟内的水。冬季到了以后，小河沟水冻冰，十一月份停工半个月，工人们闲坐着吃饭，也是一个不应有的损失。
    （二）投机心理作祟。石油和油母页岩油是很多轻重不同的溜分混合物。其中同时包括了汽油、灯油、柴油和沥青等制品原料。而我们工厂却认为变压器油目前市面缺货，价高利厚。因此专门生产变压器油，对原料中所含的其他成份一概置之不理。变压器油对原油的收得率不过百分之十至二十，连火油一共也不及百分之三十五，对其他百分之六十五的成分根本就不处理和利用，结果当然是把全部的生产费、原料费都计算在变压器油上，使产品成本高得惊人，成为滞销的另一个原因。
    （三）忽视团结技术人员。对技术人员的政治学习完全放任自流。有的技术人员要求组织他们学习政治。厂里的负责人回答说：“你们技术人员文化程度很高，可以自己看书，不必依靠领导。”这样，技术人员中间就有许多思想问题没有及时获得解决，生产上的积极性没有充分发挥。在朝鲜战事爆发后，其他工厂的技术人员都在生产上互相挑战、应战，我们厂里的就发动不起来。甚至有人闹着要回关里去。领导上对此只给加上一顶“思想没搞通”的帽子，而不是采取团结教育的态度。
    现在，厂里的负责人已经开始认识这些错误，正副经理亲自参加技术研究会，建立技术管理制度，争取在今年的生产中提高质量，降低成本。

    应该好好地保存报纸
    我们看到不少的人把人民的报纸——不论是人民日报、解放日报、东北日报或其他报纸，都随意毫不爱惜地糊墙、包东西，这样处理是很不妥当的。因为，人民的报纸是人民的喉舌。国民党的那些报纸，都是散布毒素危害广大人民，替封建主义、官僚资本主义和帝国主义说话的报纸。今天的人民的报纸，与我们人民的生活是密切联系的。国民党的报纸对人民有害，就是糊墙、包东西、撕毁它，都是不可惜的。但是替人民说话的报纸就应该很好地爱护它、保管它。人民的报纸不仅替人民说话，同时也是教育人民，指导各种工作的有力武器；人民报纸上每天都记载着国内外大事情。人民的报纸，天天登载着宝贵的、有历史意义的材料，所以我建议大家要爱护报纸，很好保存报纸。

    一方被判徒刑，可作为离婚的理由吗？编辑同志：
    六月二十六日法制委员会发布的“有关婚姻法施行的若干问题与解答”第十条的答复中说：“有正当原因不能继续夫妻关系的，应作准予离婚的判决；否则也可作不准予离婚的判决。”请问：一方被判处徒刑，对方是否可以此作为要求离婚的理由？
                                                沈养和  赵型桢沈养和、赵型桢君：
    判处徒刑是否可以作为离婚的原因，应从各个案件的具体情况来决定，不能一概而论。如犯通奸罪、汉奸罪、反革命罪等而处刑者，其配偶以此作为要求离婚的原因，自属合理。但其他罪刑，如汽车司机因不慎而撞死行人，被处徒刑，则其配偶不应以此作为要求离婚的条件。
