　　Mongol and Han Militia Fighting on the Grassland
    Hong Liu
    The Mongol and Han militia of the Jungar Banner, located in the right wing of the Ordos grassland in Suiyuan, have waged a heroic struggle to eliminate American and Chiang Kai-shek bandits and special agents in order to defend their happy lives after liberation. Recently, filled with boundless anger towards the American imperialist aggressors, they have begun practical actions to resist America, aid Korea, and defend their homes and country.

            Good Times Under Threat
    After the liberation of the Jungar Banner in 1948, the Mongol and Han people enjoyed a period of prosperity unlike anything they had experienced in centuries. This stood in stark contrast to the miserable life under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the Kuomintang reactionaries stationed over ten thousand troops in the banner, imposing exorbitant taxes and levies and engaging in relentless extortion. The banner produced 120,000 *shi* of grain annually, and various taxes often amounted to around 80,000 *shi*. The First Nutuk (equivalent to a district) of the banner, the largest grain-producing area, sometimes bore a burden exceeding 80% of its total output. The vast Mongol and Han people lived in extreme poverty, selling their children and suffering miserably. In 1947, a severe drought resulted in a complete crop failure, and 208 Mongol and Han men and women in the banner starved to death, froze to death, or were eaten by wolves. Over 50% of the banner's land was left uncultivated, and over 30,000 Mongol and Han people wandered from place to place, begging for a living. Even at the time of liberation in 1948, more than half of the families in the banner were still eating grass roots and tree bark. After liberation, the banner People's Government immediately abolished the extra taxes imposed during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, distributed 1,000 *shi* of relief grain and 800 sets of clothing transported from the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, and provided various loans totaling 130 million yuan. It also mobilized and organized the masses to implement rent reduction and a large-scale production movement. With the strong assistance of the People's Government, the Mongol and Han people worked diligently, and now the banner's cultivated land, livestock, and population have all increased significantly, and the people's living standards have also improved markedly. The Eleventh Nutuk of the banner has a total of 1,834 households. Before liberation, there were only 367 head of large livestock and 1,664 sheep, averaging one head of large livestock for every five households and less than one sheep per household. In 1950, the number of large livestock had increased to 1,921 head, and sheep to 9,921, averaging one head of large livestock and five sheep per household. The Second Aili (equivalent to a township) originally had 8,863 *xiang* of cultivated land, of which 4,400 *xiang* were uncultivated before liberation. In 1950, in addition to cultivating the original uncultivated land, another 2,360 *xiang* were added. Before liberation, the entire banner averaged one felt blanket (used as a quilt) for every ten people. In 1950, there were three cotton quilts and mattresses for every five people. The Mongol citizen Huang Fengqi used to have only one tattered quilt for his whole family, wore only a tattered single pair of trousers even in the depths of winter, and had to eat bran and vegetables for half the year. Now, every member of his family has a cotton quilt and a felt mattress. Last year, they wore a total of 20 bolts of homespun cloth, raised five head of livestock, hired a shepherd, and he even got married. Han citizen Shi Liushier used to work as a long-term laborer, without a single room of his own, not a single *long* of land, and no livestock. After liberation, he was allocated 15 *mu* of garden land, and that year he harvested over 20 *shi* of grain, wore 15 bolts of homespun cloth, and last year he also acquired two ox carts. The Mongol and Han people, after turning over a new leaf, often compose songs to describe the suffering of the past and the happy life of today, such as saying: In the past, "We couldn't eat our fill of bran and bitter vegetables," but now, "Two thick and one thin, grains are always on our lips" (referring to three meals a day); in the past, they wore "felt linings and pocket faces, fleas biting and searching, nowhere to be seen," but now, they have "blue cloth jackets covering their 'duze' (buttocks), lamb's wool towels wiping their noses, and black cloth 'shina' shoes."
    However, the remaining American and Chiang Kai-shek bandits and special agents are still seriously endangering the good lives of the Mongol and Han people. According to incomplete statistics: from the winter before last year to June of last year, a total of 18 Mongol and Han cadres and civilians were killed by bandits and special agents, over 100 were injured, and in Nalin Suo alone, as many as 30 women were raped. Throughout the banner, over 20,000 silver dollars, 600 *shi* of grain, over 500 head of livestock, and over 10,000 sets of clothing were robbed. More than 20 Mongolian women's headdresses (each worth several million RMB) were stolen. The Mongol citizen Sanqing Lai angrily said: "American and Chiang Kai-shek bandits and special agents are the mortal enemies of our Mongol and Han people!"

            The Anti-Bandit Struggle on the Grassland
    "Eliminate American and Chiang Kai-shek bandits and special agents, and defend our good life!" Under this resounding slogan, the Mongol and Han militia of the Jungar Banner launched a heroic struggle to eliminate bandits and special agents. They used shovels, hoes, kitchen knives, and wooden sticks to kill and capture large numbers of bandits and special agents. Last spring, over 40 soldiers from the Kuomintang uprising troops stationed in the Jungar Banner, incited by the American and Chiang Kai-shek bandit Zhang Fubin (who had served as a deputy company commander), defected to become bandits, and attempted to loot the tax bureau on the night of their defection. However, the town's militia had made preparations in advance, and after a night of bloody battle, repelled all the rebel bandits, preventing damage to the townspeople's property. Later, this group of rebel bandits fled to Dinggui Kiln in the First Nutuk, thinking they were "back on their home turf," and relaxed and rested. More than ten villagers, led by squad leader Yan Baocheng, unarmed, seized all the rebel bandits' weapons and personnel (a total of 44 rifles and pistols). The escaped rebel bandit leader Zhang Fubin and two other bandits were captured alive by militia Hao Maoleng (a Mongol citizen) while fleeing. Militia Liu Sizhong from the Fifth Nutuk once stayed at his brother-in-law's house when three bandits and special agents came in the middle of the night. Liu Sizhong killed one bandit and special agent with a fire poker and a kitchen knife. Five days later, the two escaped bandits and special agents returned, attempting to avenge the dead. At this time, Liu Sizhong had already retrieved a rifle from the Nutuk and shot both of these bandits and special agents to death, seizing two guns. Militia Gao Shuangzhai and two others from the Fifth Nutuk not only captured bandits and special agents within their own Nutuk, but also crossed the Yellow River at night and captured two bandits and special agents from the First Nutuk, seizing two guns. The brave Mongol and Han militia often said heroically: "Even if a sparrow flies over the grassland, we have to see what kind of feathers it has. We will capture every last American and Chiang Kai-shek bandit and special agent!" From the winter before last year to June of last year, the militia solved 16 robbery cases, killed 18 bandits and special agents, wounded dozens, captured 97 alive, and seized nearly 200 rifles and pistols. With the assistance of a certain detachment of the Inner Mongolia League's People's Armed Forces, they have basically eliminated the American and Chiang Kai-shek bandits and special agents within the banner, consolidating social order.

            Resolutely Crush the Bandits' Ancestor - American Imperialism
    "Eliminating American and Chiang Kai-shek bandits and special agents is not enough. We must beat the bandits' ancestor – American imperialism – to a pulp in order to thoroughly protect our good life." This was the unanimous roar of the Mongol and Han militia of the Jungar Banner when American imperialism extended the flames of its war of aggression against Korea to the border of our great motherland.

    On November 15th of last year, a grand military parade was held throughout the banner. The troops inspected included the Mongol and Han militia from various Nutuks, as well as the Inner Mongolia League's People's Cavalry and Infantry stationed in the banner. At the beginning of the conference, the chairman first read out the letter of determination from the military and civilians of the entire banner to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu: "The Mongol and Han military and civilians of the entire banner are determined to strengthen Mongol and Han unity under your wise leadership, launch a winter training campaign, develop agricultural and pastoral production, actively pay public grain, and contribute all our strength to defend the happy grassland after liberation and to consolidate the defense of our great motherland, and strive to completely eliminate the American imperialist aggressors!" After that, all the inspected troops stood in solemn silence before the monument to the 28 martyrs who heroically sacrificed themselves for the liberation of eastern Inner Mongolia League (located on the parade ground) and made solemn oaths. The extremely wicked American-Chiang Kai-shek bandit Zhang Ni Fubin was executed on the spot. Gesh Doulin, a Mongolian militia hero who had killed and wounded two bandits and special agents with a shovel, shouted loudly at the meeting in broken Chinese: "We Mongol and Han people have suffered enough under the oppression of the Kuomintang reactionaries. Since the Communist Party and Chairman Mao came, we have had food, clothing, and livestock. Today, we can eliminate the remaining American and Chiang Kai-shek bandits and special agents, and we also have the confidence to defeat the bandits' ancestor – the American devils!" His words represented the common will and determination of the Mongol and Han militia of the entire banner and every Mongol and Han person on the grassland.

　　战斗在草原上的蒙汉民兵
    宏流
    绥远鄂尔多斯草原右翼前旗——准格尔旗的蒙汉民兵，为了保卫解放后的幸福生活，曾经展开了扑灭美、蒋匪特的英勇斗争；最近更以对美帝侵略者的无限愤怒，开始了抗美援朝保家卫国的实际行动。
            好光景受到了危害
    准旗于一九四八年解放后，蒙汉人民过着数百年来从未有过的好光景。这与国民党反动派统治下的悲惨生活，形成了极尖锐的对比。抗日战争胜利后，国民党反动派在该旗屯兵万余人，苛捐杂税，敲诈勒索，残酷异常。全旗每年产粮十二万石，各项捐税常年在八万石左右。该旗第一努图克（相当于区）是全旗最大的产粮区，有时负担竟超过总产量的百分之八十以上。广大蒙汉人民十室九空，卖儿卖女，悲惨度日。一九四七年遭荒旱，颗粒不收，全旗饿死、冻死及被狼吃掉的蒙汉男女有二百零八人。全旗荒芜土地百分之五十以上，更有三万蒙汉人民，流离他乡，讨吃为生。直到一九四八年解放时，全旗仍有一半以上的人家吃草根树皮。解放后，旗人民政府立即废除了国民党反动统治时期的额外捐税，发放了从陕甘宁边区运来的救济粮一千石，衣服八百套，同时，发放了各种贷款一亿三千万元；并发动与组织群众实行减租和大生产运动。在人民政府大力帮助下，蒙汉人民辛勤劳动，现在全旗耕地、牲畜、人口均有很大增加，人民生活水平也显著提高。该旗第十一努图克共有一千八百三十四户人家，解放前只有大牲畜三百六十七头，羊一千六百六十四只，平均五户一头大牲畜，一户还合不到一只羊。一九五○年大牲畜已增加到一千九百二十一头，羊九千九百二十一只，平均每户有一头大牲畜和五只羊。第二爱里（相当于乡）原有耕地八千八百六十三垧，解放前荒芜四千四百垧；一九五○年除耕种了原有荒地，并增加了二千三百六十垧。解放前，全旗每十人平均一条毛毡（当被子盖），一九五○年每五人就有三条棉被褥。蒙民黄凤岐过去全家有一条烂被子，十冬腊月穿着破单裤，一年中要吃半年糠菜，现在全家每人有一条棉被和一床铺毡，去年共穿了二十匹土布，又养五头牲畜，雇一个放羊工，自己还娶了老婆。汉民史六十二，过去当长工，房无一间，地无一垅，也没有牲畜，解放后调剂了十五亩园子地，当年打谷子二十多石，穿了十五匹土布，去年又拴起两套牛车。翻身后的蒙汉人民，常编一些歌词儿来描写过去的痛苦和今天的幸福生活，如说：过去是“糠皮、苦菜吃不饱”如今是“两稠一稀，五谷不离嘴”（指一天吃三顿饭）；过去穿的是“毛毡里，口袋面，蚤子干咬找不见”，如今却是“蓝布袄子包‘独则’（屁股），羊肚子毛巾揩鼻则，实纳鞋旁黑面则”。
    可是，残存的美、蒋匪特仍严重地危害着蒙汉人民的好光景，据不完全统计：从前年冬至去年六月，遭匪特杀害的蒙汉干部、群众共十八人，伤百余人，被强奸的妇女，仅纳林锁一地即达三十名，全旗被抢白洋约二万余元，粮食六百石，牲畜五百多头，衣物万余套，蒙古妇女“头戴”二十余付（每付约值人民币数百万元）。蒙民三庆赖气愤地说：“美、蒋匪特，就是咱蒙汉人民的死敌！”
            草原上的肃匪斗争
    “铲除美、蒋匪特，保卫咱们的光景”，在这个响亮的口号下，准旗蒙汉民兵们，掀起了扑灭匪特的英勇斗争。他们用铁锹、镢头、菜刀、木棍，打死和活捉了大批的匪特。去年春天，驻准旗的国民党起义部队中，有四十多人在美、蒋匪特张富斌（曾任副连长）的煽动下，叛变为匪，并企图于叛变的当天晚上，抢劫税局；但该镇民兵事先已有准备，经一夜血战，击退全部叛匪，使该镇人民财产未遭损害。后该股叛匪逃窜到第一努图克丁贵窑子，叛匪以为“回到本乡地面”，便放心大胆地休息。这村民兵十余人，在班长阎保成率领下，赤手空拳缴获了叛匪的全部武器和人马（共四十四支长短枪），漏网的叛匪头子张富斌等两匪，在逃跑途中，也被民兵郝毛楞（蒙民）活捉了。第五努图克民兵刘四中，有一次住在他姐夫家里，半夜来了三个匪特，刘四中用掏火棒子和菜刀杀死一个匪特。隔了五天，逃走的那两个匪特又来了，企图为死者报仇。这时，刘四中已经从努图克领回一支步枪，便将这两个匪特一齐打死，夺枪两支。第五努图克民兵高双寨等三人，他们不仅在本努图克境内捕捉匪特，还夜渡黄河，到第一努图克捉回匪特两名，夺枪两支。勇敢的蒙汉民兵们常这样英雄地说：“麻雀飞过草地，也要看看它是什么毛片，美、蒋匪特都要一个个捉尽！”从前年冬至去年六月，民兵共破获抢案十六件，打死匪特十八名，打伤数十名，活捉九十七名，缴获长短枪近二百支，并在伊盟人民某支队的协助下，已将全旗境内的美、蒋匪特基本肃清，巩固了社会治安。
            坚决粉碎匪特的老祖宗——美帝
    “消灭了美、蒋匪特还不算，一定要把匪特的老祖宗——美帝国主义打个稀疤烂，才能彻底保住我们的好光景”。这是美帝将侵朝战火烧向我伟大祖国边境的时候，准旗蒙汉民兵们一致的吼声。
    去年十一月十五日，全旗举行了隆重的阅兵大会。受检阅的部队，有各努图克的蒙汉民兵，及驻该旗的伊盟人民骑、步武装。大会开始，主席首先宣读全旗军民上毛主席、朱总司令的决心书：“全旗蒙汉军民，坚决在您们英明的领导下，加强蒙汉团结，展开冬季大练兵，发展农牧业生产，踊跃交纳公粮，为保卫解放后幸福的草原，为巩固伟大祖国的国防，贡献我们一切力量，彻底消灭美帝侵略者而奋斗！”之后，检阅的全体部队，肃立在为解放伊（盟）东（部）而英勇牺牲的二十八位烈士碑前（设立在检阅场上），举行了庄严的宣誓。当场并处决了罪大恶极的美蒋匪特—张逆富斌。曾经用铁锹打死和打伤两个匪特的蒙古民兵英雄格什斗林，用不熟练的汉话，在会上大声疾呼：“我们蒙汉人民，过去在国民党反动派压迫下，受够了痛苦，自从共产党、毛主席来了，有了吃、穿和牲畜；今天我们能肃清残存的美、蒋匪特，也有信心打败匪特的老祖宗—美国鬼子！”他的话代表了全旗蒙汉民兵和草原上每一个蒙汉人民的共同意志和决心。
