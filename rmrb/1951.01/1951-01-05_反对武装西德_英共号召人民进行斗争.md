Xinhua News Agency, London, January 2nd: According to TASS, the Political Committee of the British Communist Party issued a statement on December 30 regarding the Brussels meeting of the North Atlantic aggressive bloc, exposing the aggressive nature of the decisions passed at the Brussels meeting, particularly the decision to rearm West Germany, and calling on Communist Party members and all peace-loving people to fight against the threat of a new world war. The statement pointed out that the decisions of the Brussels meeting showed a betrayal of the Potsdam Agreement and the Anglo-Soviet Alliance Treaty, preparing to expand the war in the Far East and preparing for a war of aggression in Europe. The statement firmly demanded the implementation of the Potsdam Agreement, the establishment of a unified, democratic and demilitarized Germany, and the implementation of the Anglo-Soviet Alliance Treaty as the keystone of peace in Europe and the world.

The Political Committee warned that the Brussels meeting's war plan meant the end of British national independence. Once the British armed forces are placed under the command of Eisenhower, and once the fate of British industry is in the hands of American economic dictators, British independence will be declared over. Therefore, whoever supports these resolutions is a traitor to Britain. It is the responsibility of every patriotic British citizen—regardless of his political views—to oppose these proposals that lead to national suicide.

The Political Committee called for arousing the entire labor movement and all peace-loving people with the greatest strength to struggle against the decisions of the Brussels meeting, to strive for the establishment of a democratic and unified Germany, to sign a peace treaty with Germany and to withdraw the occupying forces after the treaty is signed, to end the Korean War and to allow the People's Republic of China to enter the United Nations.

The Political Committee demanded that the British government immediately begin new negotiations with the Soviet Union to achieve the goal of peace, and demanded that Britain withdraw from the North Atlantic Treaty and the war policy of the United States.

　　反对武装西德
    英共号召人民进行斗争
    【新华社二日讯】据塔斯社伦敦讯：英国共产党政治委员会十二月三十日就北大西洋侵略集团布鲁塞尔会议发表声明，揭露布鲁塞尔会议所通过的特别是重新武装西德的决定的侵略性质，并号召共产党员及所有爱好和平人士为反对新世界战争威胁而进行斗争。声明指出：布鲁塞尔会议的决定表明背弃波茨坦协定和英苏同盟条约，准备扩大远东战争并准备欧洲的侵略战争。声明坚决要求履行波茨坦协定，建立统一、民主和非军国主义的德国，要求履行英苏同盟条约作为欧洲和全世界和平的枢纽。
    政治委员会警告称：布鲁塞尔会议的战争计划意味着英国国家独立的寿终正寝。一旦英国的武装力量交给艾森豪威尔指挥，一旦英国工业的命运操在美国经济独裁者的手里，英国的独立就要宣告终结。因此，谁支持这些决议，谁就是英国的卖国贼。反对这些招致民族自杀的建议，是每一个爱国的英国公民——不管他的政治观点如何——的责任。
    政治委员会号召以最大力量唤起整个劳工运动和一切爱好和平的人民进行斗争，反对布鲁塞尔会议的决议，争取建立民主统一的德国，签订对德和约并在和约签订后撤退占领军，终止朝鲜战争并让中华人民共和国进入联合国。
    政治委员会要求英政府立即开始与苏联进行新的谈判以实现和平的目的，并要求英国脱离北大西洋公约和美国的战争政策。
