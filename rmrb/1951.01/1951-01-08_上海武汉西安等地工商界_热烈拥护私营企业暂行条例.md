Xinhua News Agency, 6th—Business communities in Shanghai, Wuhan, Xi'an, and other places have expressed their support for the "Provisional Regulations on Private Enterprises" promulgated by the State Council of the Central People's Government. They believe that these regulations encourage the enthusiasm of private enterprises that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, as well as the enthusiasm of private investment in business, thereby strongly supporting the development of private enterprises. The Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce issued a statement on the promulgation of these regulations, saying: "The Shanghai business community will actively study the basic spirit of these regulations in order to implement them into further enterprise reform." Liu Hongsheng, Rong Yiren, Wu Yun Chu, Xiang Shuxiang and other people in the Shanghai business community also issued statements, believing that these regulations are in line with the Common Program and suitable for the actual situation. The Wuhan business community issued a statement on the 4th, pointing out that the "Provisional Regulations on Private Enterprises" are a necessary measure for the economic construction of New Democracy, and its purpose is to restore and develop industry and commerce. The instruction called on industrialists and businessmen to study in depth and carefully understand the basic spirit of the regulations, and to fully implement them. Li Wujiu, manager of Shenxin Cotton Mill, believes that the promulgation of the regulations has greatly encouraged industrialists and businessmen across the country, and can make individuals holding idle capital interested in investing in legitimate industrial and commercial enterprises that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. This is beneficial to the operators of private industrial and commercial enterprises in promoting business. Ye Yutian, Chairman of the Xi'an Federation of Industry and Commerce, and Zhang Shixin, Deputy Chairman, issued a written opinion on behalf of the Xi'an business community, saying: "The main spirit of the 'Provisional Regulations on Private Enterprises' is to encourage private capital to invest in enterprises that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. From this regulation, we can fully see that private enterprises in new democratic countries should be very different from private enterprises in capitalist countries that blindly produce and only care about the interests of capitalists. This regulation indicates a clear direction for national industrialists and businessmen, eliminates many doubts in investment, and encourages the confidence of managers in business operations, which will help the development of the new democratic economic undertaking." In addition to expressing their firm support, they also called on all private entrepreneurs in Xi'an to study this regulation in order to follow the regulations, improve management, and run enterprises well.

The Chongqing business community also expressed warm welcome and support for the "Provisional Regulations on Private Enterprises". Hu Ziang, director of the preparatory committee of the city's Federation of Industry and Commerce, said: The promulgation of these regulations shows that private industry and commerce have a bright future under the leadership of the state-owned economy. Fan Hengcai, manager of Tianfu Coal Mine Company, said that these regulations gave an injection of fresh blood to those who felt that there was no profit in investing and operating enterprises; the past erroneous ideas of some industrialists and businessmen who were afraid of labor interference in administration and afraid of not being able to share the surplus will also be self-defeating. Some industries have already begun to study these regulations and are preparing for regular discussions.

　　上海武汉西安等地工商界
    热烈拥护私营企业暂行条例
    【新华社六日讯】上海、武汉、西安等地工商业界对中央人民政府政务院所公布的私营企业暂行条例都表示拥护，他们认为这个条例鼓励了有利国计民生私营企业经营的积极性，和私人投资营业的积极性，因而有力地扶助了私营企业的发展。上海市工商联合会筹备会为此条例的颁布发表的声明说：“上海工商界将积极学习这一条例的基本精神，以便贯彻到进一步的企业改造工作中去。”上海工商界人士刘鸿生、荣毅仁、吴蕴初、项叔翔等人亦分别发表谈话，认为这一条例是符合共同纲领和适合实际情况的。武汉市工商界四日发表声明指出：私营企业暂行条例是新民主主义经济建设的必要措施，其目的是为了工商业的恢复和发展。该指示号召工商业者深入学习，细致体会该条例的基本精神，并全力奉行。申新纱厂经理厉无咎认为该条例的公布，给全国的工商业者以很大鼓舞，并可使握有游资的个人有兴趣向正当的有利于国计民生的工商企业投资，这对于私营工商业的经营者推动业务是有好处的。西安市工商业联合会主任委员叶雨田、副主任委员张士心，代表西安市工商界发表书面意见称：“私营企业暂行条例主要的精神在鼓励私人资本投资于有利于国计民生的企业。从这一条例可充分看出新民主主义国家的私营企业，与资本主义国家盲目生产只顾资本家利益的私营企业应大有区别。这个条例，给民族工商业者指示了一个明确方向，消除了在投资方面的许多疑虑，并鼓舞了经理人员们对于业务经营的信心，将有助于新民主主义经济事业的发展。”他们除表示坚决拥护外，并号召西安市所有私营企业者研习这一个条例，以便遵循条例的规定，改善经营管理，把企业搞好。
    重庆工商界也表示热烈欢迎和拥护“私营企业暂行条例”。该市工商联合会筹备会主任胡子昂说：这一条例的公布，说明私营工商业在国营经济领导下有其光明的前途。天府煤矿公司经理樊恒才说这一条例给感到投资经营企业没有利益的人打了一针清血针；过去某些工商业家怕劳方干涉行政、怕自己分不到盈余的错误想法，也将不攻自破。有的行业已开始学习这一条例，并准备定期讨论。
