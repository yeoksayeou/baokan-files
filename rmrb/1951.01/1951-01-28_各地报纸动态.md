　　Newspaper Updates from Various Regions

　　The Qingdao Daily in Shandong published a special issue entitled "Love the Motherland Joint Special Issue" on January 21st. In addition to publishing articles such as excerpts from Lenin and Stalin's "On New Patriotism," it also published an article in the "News Correspondents" column, calling on correspondents and writers to "fill every line of their articles with the spirit of loving the Motherland."
　　"Loving the Motherland" is a constant theme in all newspapers and publications. Educating correspondents and various writers to implement the spirit of "loving the Motherland" in their works should be a regular task for editors.
　　The Shanghai Ta Kung Pao published a "Letter of Condolence to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army" from all its staff members on January 16th as that day's editorial. On the 17th, it published a letter to readers: "Please Write Letters of慰问", stating, "We are willing to make our best efforts to quickly forward these emotional letters to the soldiers." It is very necessary for newspapers to do their best to mobilize condolences for the People's Volunteer Army and their families.
　　In order to cooperate with the land reform in Guangdong, the Southern Daily reduced the price of the newspaper from 700 yuan to 500 yuan in eleven counties implementing land reform, starting in January. It is worth promoting this method of newspapers taking appropriate measures to take care of rural readers under the principle of enterprise management.
　　During the visit of the Soviet sports delegation to Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Wuhan and other places and the holding of basketball games, Guangming Daily, Changjiang Daily, etc. all organized special issues introducing Soviet sports and basketball experience. The Shanghai Ta Kung Pao published a symposium record entitled "From the Visit of the Soviet Sports Delegation to Our Country to Our Country's Sports." In order to enhance the health of our people, it is very beneficial for newspapers to pay more attention to matters related to sports.
　　　　People's Education Publishing House letter to the responsible comrade of the Book Review Agency:
　　Guangming Daily published an article by Mr. Ma Jian on January 19th, "Muhammad's Sword," which mentioned that the content of the current junior high school foreign history textbook (edited by Shen Changhong) has inappropriate parts. We immediately checked it and found that the first subsection of the second section of the second chapter of the book, "The Rise and Division of the Islamic Empire," should be revised. The spring supply of the book has already been printed, but in order to be cautious, we would like to notify middle school history teachers across the country of the revision method before the autumn re-edition to make corrections during teaching.
　　We are afraid that everyone is concerned about this issue, so we will first send a letter to the book review to publish our revision.

　　各地报纸动态
    山东青岛日报一月二十一日刊出了一个《爱祖国联合特刊》，除发表了列宁、斯大林关于《论新爱国主义》的言论摘要等文章之外，在“新闻通讯员”栏中并发表文章，号召通讯员和写作者，把“爱祖国的精神充溢在篇篇文章的字里行间。”
    “爱祖国”是一切报纸书刊的经常的宣传主题，教育通讯员和各种写作者在作品中贯彻“爱祖国”的精神，应该成为编辑人员的经常任务。
    上海大公报一月十六日发表了全体职工“给中国人民志愿军的慰问信”，作为当天的社论。十七日发表致读者的信：“请写慰劳信”，表示“我们愿尽最大努力，把这些充满感情的信件尽速转达战士们”。报纸尽最大力量来发动慰劳人民志愿军和他们的家属是很必要的。
    为了配合广东土地改革的进行，南方日报从一月起在十一个实行土地改革的县份中，报纸售价由七百元减低至五百元。报纸在企业化经营的原则下，采取适当的方法照顾农村的读者，这种办法，值得提倡。
    在苏联体育代表团访问京、津、沪、穗、汉等地并举行篮球比赛期间，光明日报、长江日报等都组织了介绍苏联体育和篮球经验的专刊，上海大公报发表了题为《由苏联体育代表团访问我国谈到我国体育》的座谈会记录。为了增强我国人民的健康，报纸把较多的注意放在有关体育运动的事情上是很有益的。
            人民教育出版社来信书报评论社负责同志：
    一月十九日光明日报登载了马坚先生的《穆罕默德的宝剑》一文，其中说及现行初中外国历史课本（沈长虹编）的内容有不妥当的地方，我们即进行检查，知道该书的第二章第二节第一小节“回教帝国的兴起与分裂”，应加修改。现在该书的春季供应本已经印好，但为慎重起见，我们想在秋季再版本改正以前，先用其他办法把该项修改办法通知全国各地中学历史教师，在教学时即提出订正。
    我们恐怕大家都很关心这个问题，所以先把我们进行修改的情形，函请在书报评论上发表一下。
                              人民教育出版社    五一年一月二十五日
