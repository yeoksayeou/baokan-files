　　Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 8th. The Central and Southern Branch of the China Peace Committee has been established on the 6th. Zhao Yimin and Chen Mingshu were elected as chairman and vice chairman of the branch. At the inaugural meeting, Chairman Zhao Yimin gave a brief report on the movement to resist America and aid Korea and defend the homeland in the central and southern region, and pointed out: In the future, this patriotic movement will be expanded and deepened, and the movement will be promoted from large cities to small and medium-sized cities, and even to the vast rural areas; and from organized masses to unorganized masses, in order to further improve the national self-esteem and self-confidence of people of all strata, thoroughly eliminate the erroneous ideas of being pro-American, worshiping America, and fearing America, and establish correct ideas of hating, despising, and disdaining American imperialism. The meeting also passed a telegram of respect to the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army.
    According to a Xinhua News Agency Hankou dispatch: People from all walks of life in the Central and Southern District are deeply carrying out the movement to resist America and aid Korea and defend the homeland in combination with their actual work.

　　The patriotic production competition movement of workers in the entire region has expanded from railways and large-scale public and private factories and enterprises to remote and scattered mines. Railway workers have achieved brilliant results with "eliminating accidents," "super-axle traction," "hauling more goods," and "saving more coal" as their competition goals. The Kaifeng Locomotive Section of the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau successfully completed the plan of 500,000 kilometers of safe operation on December 5, 1950, setting a new record for the entire bureau. Under the slogan of "The factory is the battlefield, and the machine is the weapon," the production efficiency of workers in various factories and mines has rapidly increased. The main products of non-ferrous metals, cement, and electrical equipment in the entire region have all overfulfilled the annual production tasks half a month to two months ahead of schedule. Many factories have used the advanced experience of the Ma Hengchang team and the Zhao Guoyou workshop, so that the competition movement has shifted from the initial surprise attack state to a normal and consolidated state.

　　More than 50,000 young workers and students in the entire region have responded to the call of the motherland and enthusiastically applied for various military cadre schools. Medical workers in various provinces and cities have organized field medical teams, learned battlefield first aid techniques, and prepared to go to Korea. More than 300 doctors, nurses, and pharmacists from Xiehe Hospital in Wuhan, Hubei Provincial People's Hospital, and Hubei Provincial Medical College have signed up to participate in the medical team. The first batch of volunteer surgical team to North Korea, composed of twelve medical workers in Jiangxi Province, set off from Nanchang on the 4th. More than 4,000 people's representatives from all walks of life in Nanchang held a grand farewell ceremony at the station. People who saw them off threw flowers at the twelve white-clothed warriors. Dr. Xu Fansun (Deputy Director of Surgery at the Affiliated Hospital of Jiangxi Provincial Medical College), the captain of the surgical team, thanked the people who saw them off and promised that after arriving on the Korean battlefield, he would dedicate all his strength to serving the brave soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army.

　　Farmers in Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Guangxi and other provinces who have already or are undergoing land reform are using practical actions such as quickly paying public grain and actively participating in militia and local armed forces to enrich and strengthen national defense forces. As of December 25, the autumn public grain in Hunan, Hubei, Henan, Jiangxi provinces and the suburbs of Wuhan and Guangzhou cities had been fully paid into storage. The number of militias in the entire region has expanded from 1.15 million at the end of October to 2.5 million at the end of November. Local militias have become a powerful assistant to the bandit suppression troops and railway public security personnel in suppressing bandits, protecting roads, and guarding warehouses.

　　People from all walks of life in Wuhan, Guangzhou, Nanchang, Changsha, Kaifeng and other cities have held rallies to accuse American imperialism of its crimes of aggression and demonstrations. In Wuhan alone, 200,000 people participated in this accusation and demonstration movement. Nearly 80,000 people from the industrial and commercial circles in Wuhan participated in the demonstration. The marching team included an elderly group composed of more than 80 silver-haired and white-bearded elders from the industrial and commercial circles. The people of the whole city were excited and encouraged by this moving scene. Industrial and commercial circles in other small and medium-sized cities have also successively held patriotic parades and demonstrations, formulated patriotic pacts, and extensively carried out activities to comfort the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army. The number of people in the religious circles in the entire region who support the movement for autonomy, self-support, self-propagation, and renovation has reached more than 3,000. Patriotic teachers and students from Wuhan Central China University, Guangdong Lingnan University, Jiangxi St. Louis Nurses School, and other church-run schools have resolutely exposed and struggled against the reactionary behaviors and remarks of American professors such as Pearl Buck, who slandered the Chinese people, and corrected the American-worshiping thoughts of some teachers and students who were deceived by American imperialism.

　　The Federation of Literary and Art Circles of the Central and Southern District and Henan Province have organized anti-American and aid-Korea propaganda committees. A new creation movement is underway in various places. The Henan Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles awarded 10,000 catties of wheat as a bonus to outstanding literary and art workers who emerged in this movement. The Hubei Provincial Cultural and Art Troupe, which participated in the land reform movement, used art exhibitions and mobile libraries to conduct current affairs propaganda in conjunction with land reform. Among them, the serial history painting of American imperialism's aggression against China played a great educational role for the peasants.

    【新华社汉口八日电】中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会中南分会已于六日成立。该会选出赵毅敏、陈铭枢为正、副主席。在成立会上，赵毅敏主席就中南全区抗美援朝保家卫国运动作了简单报告，并指出：今后将扩大深入开展这一爱国运动，要把运动由大城市推向中小城市，以至广大乡村；并由有组织群众推向无组织群众，以进一步提高各阶层人民的民族自尊心和自信心，彻底肃清亲美、崇美、恐美的错误思想和树立仇视、鄙视、蔑视美帝国主义的正确思想。大会并通过向中国人民志愿军及朝鲜人民军致敬电。
    【本报讯】据新华社汉口电：中南区各界人民正在结合实际工作深入开展抗美援朝保家卫国运动。
    全区职工的爱国主义生产竞赛运动已由铁路和各大规模的公私营工厂、企业，扩展到偏僻分散的矿山。铁路工人以“消灭事故”、“超轴牵引”、“多拉货”、“多省煤”作为竞赛目标，获得了辉煌成绩。郑州铁路局开封机务段于一九五零年十二月五日即胜利完成安全走行五十万公里的计划，创了全局新纪录。各工厂、矿山职工在“工厂是战场，机器是武器”的口号下，生产效率迅速提高。全区有色金属、水泥、电工器材等主要产品，均提前半个月到两个月超额完成了全年生产任务。许多工厂运用了马恒昌小组和赵国有车间的先进经验，使竞赛运动由初期的突击状态转入正常和巩固。
    全区有五万多青年工人和学生。响应祖国号召，踊跃投考各种军事干部学校。各省市医务工作者纷纷组织了战地医疗队，学习战场救护技术，准备前往朝鲜。武汉市协和医院、湖北省立人民医院和湖北省立医学院报名参加医疗队的医生、护士、药剂师等共三百多人。江西省十二位医务工作者组成的首批志愿赴朝手术队已于四日自南昌出发。南昌市各界人民代表四千多人在车站举行了盛大欢送会。欢送的人们纷纷向十二位白衣战士投掷鲜花。手术队队长胥繁荪医师（江西省立医科专门学校附属医院外科副主任）向欢送的人们致谢，并保证到了朝鲜战场后，献出所有的力量，为英勇的我国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军的战士们服务。
    已经或正在进行土地改革运动的河南、湖北、湖南、江西、广东、广西等省农民，用迅速缴纳公粮，踊跃参加民兵和地方武装等实际行动来充实和加强国防力量。至十二月二十五日止，湖南、湖北、河南、江西四省和武汉、广州两市郊区的秋季公粮，已全部缴纳入仓。全区民兵人数已由十月底的一百十五万扩展到十一月底的二百五十万人。各地民兵成为剿匪部队和铁路公安人员剿匪、护路和护仓的有力助手。
    武汉、广州、南昌、长沙、开封等城市的各阶层人民群众，都曾经分别举行控诉美帝国主义侵略罪行与示威游行大会。仅武汉一市就有二十万人参加这一控诉与示威运动。武汉市工商界参加示威游行的近八万人。游行队伍中有由八十几个银首白须的工商界耆老所组成的老人团。全市人民都为这一感人场面而兴奋鼓舞。其他中小城市的工商界也都先后举行了爱国游行示威，订出了爱国公约，并广泛开展慰问我国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军的运动。全区宗教界拥护自治、自养、自传、革新运动的签名人数已达三千余人。教会举办的武汉市华中大学、广东岭南大学、江西圣类思护士学校等的爱国教师和学生，对诬蔑中国人民的美籍教授席珍珠等的反动行为和言论，作了坚决的揭露和斗争，纠正了部分教师和学生中因受美帝国主义蒙蔽欺骗而产生的崇美思想。
    中南区及河南省的文学艺术界联合会均组织了抗美援朝宣传委员会。新的创作运动正在各地开展。河南省文联以一万斤小麦的奖金，奖励在这一运动中涌现的优秀文艺工作者。参加土地改革运动的湖北省文工团，利用美术展览、流动图书馆等方式，结合土地改革进行时事宣传，其中美帝国主义侵略我国的连环史画，对农民起了很大的教育作用。
