Response to People's Daily Criticism

　　Concerning the dispute between the Su Bei Lianshui Post Office and private newspaper distribution industry
    Editor's Note: On November 20th of last year, we received a letter of accusation signed "Family of the Deceased," accusing Chen Yilian, the Director of the Su Bei Lianshui Post Office, of suppressing the private distribution of newspapers, driving newspaper vendor Wang Jun to his death. Similar letters were also found in other locations. We immediately forwarded the case to the Central People's Supervisory Committee for investigation and handling. On December 30th of last year, the Central People's Supervisory Committee informed us of the preliminary investigation results of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications regarding the case. On January 6th of this year, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications provided us with a detailed report of the investigation conducted by the East China Postal and Telecommunications Administration and others. According to the two investigation materials, Wang Jun died of a severe stomach illness and was not driven to his death by Chen Yilian, Director of the Lianshui Post Office. However, it is a fact that the Lianshui Post Office did not properly grasp the policy of public-private relations in distribution work and took exclusionary and suppressive actions against private distribution points. This situation should attract widespread attention in the current distribution work of the post office. In the future, in order to do a good job in newspaper distribution, post offices, newspaper vendors, and private distribution points must cooperate closely. Now, in order to clarify the facts of the dispute between the Lianshui Post Office and Wang Jun, so that post offices and newspaper distribution industries in various places can learn from this lesson, we specially publish an abstract of the investigation report of the East China Postal and Telecommunications Administration below.

  Abstract of the East China Postal and Telecommunications Administration's "Investigation Report on the Death of Lianshui Newspaper Vendor Wang Jun"
  (1) Wang Jun's newspaper and periodical distribution in Lianshui
    Newspaper vendor Wang Jun distributed newspapers in Lianshui. Before August 1950, Wang Jun developed some subscribers in Lianshui because the post office neglected distribution work. On July 20th (referring to 1950, the same below), Wang Jun was approved by the Shanghai Postal Administration Bureau's Distribution Section to directly receive the Jiefang Daily, and he resided in Lianshui.
    When Lianshui and Liandong counties merged, the post offices of the two counties also merged. According to the instruction No. 373 issued by the General Post Office: "The business scope of agents shall be limited to the jurisdiction of the local post office, and they shall not develop business across regions." and Article 15, Paragraph 3 of the Shanghai Post Office's Measures for Distributing Jiefang, Labor, and Youth Newspapers: "The distributors in the location of each bureau shall be limited to those who have established a distribution relationship with the Shanghai Jiefang Daily before May 1, 1950. In the future, applications should not be accepted." The Lianshui Post Office believed that Wang's distribution of newspapers and periodicals in Lianshui was illegal.
    On August 27th, Wang Jun added 15 copies of the Su Bei Daily to his order from the Lianshui Post Office, but the Lianshui Post Office did not grant him preferential treatment. Wang then requested the Yangzhou Post Office to send the newspapers, and the Yangzhou Post Office agreed to his request. However, the Lianshui Post Office refused to receive and distribute a total of six issues of the newspapers sent by the Yangzhou Post Office to Wang Jun. After receiving the returned newspapers from the Lianshui Post Office, the Yangzhou Post Office pointed out the impropriety of the Lianshui Post Office and immediately established a direct distribution relationship with Wang Jun for 15 copies of the newspaper. Since then, the relationship between the Lianshui Post Office and Wang Jun deteriorated.
    On September 22nd, the Shanghai Postal Administration Bureau notified the Lianshui Post Office that it had established a distribution relationship with Wang Jun and attached a blank registration form, requesting the Lianshui Post Office to provide guidance. The Lianshui Post Office did not handle the matter according to the Shanghai Postal Administration Bureau's opinion and continuously reported to the Huaiyin Central Command Bureau and the Yangzhou Bureau to revoke Wang Jun's right to distribute the Su Bei Daily. The Yangzhou Bureau agreed with the Lianshui Post Office's opinion on September 27th and stopped sending newspapers to Wang Jun from November. The Huaiyin Command Bureau also ordered the Lianshui Post Office twice in early October to take over Wang Jun's subscribers. The Lianshui County People's Government and others believed that this would cause Wang Jun to lose his job and asked the Lianshui Post Office to first understand the situation of Wang Jun's subscribers and then study the handling method. Before the issue was finally decided, Wang Jun died of illness on October 22nd.
  (2) The truth about Wang Jun's death
    Wang Jun had a severe stomach illness. According to his second elder brother, Wang Shaoqing, and others, he had been seriously ill several times since 1949.
    On the afternoon of October 19th, Wang went to the Lianshui Post Office to pick up the newspapers, and Director Chen asked him about the number of newspapers distributed. The number reported by Wang did not match the actual quantity, and Chen followed him to the Renhe Inn to ask for a copy of the distribution list. However, he did not mention taking over any subscribers, only stating that he was ordered by his superiors to understand the distribution figures in order to better grasp the distribution work.
    Wang Jun fell ill that night and was bedridden. Wang claimed that he could take one or two doses of medicine using an old prescription, and he took out the prescription from his body and got the medicine at Songshoutang. It was ineffective, and on the 22nd, he hired a car to return to Huai, and died that night.
    According to the above situation and confirmation from all parties such as the Lianshui County Government, County Party Committee, Public Security Bureau, Renhe Inn, and Songshoutang, Wang Jun's death was indeed a recurrence of an old illness, and Director Chen of the Lianshui Post Office cannot be held responsible for this.
  (3) Biases of the Post Office in distribution work
    After the integration of postal and distribution services, the Lianshui Bureau had two biases towards private distributors: The first stage was neglecting distribution work. Even when subscribers subscribed to newspapers from the post office, the post office would then turn to Wang Jun to subscribe. They were indifferent to private newspaper vendors and did not even talk about the leadership and management of newspaper vendors. The later stage mechanically emphasized procedures and adhered to the abstract concepts of "legal" and "illegal," denying Wang Jun's achievements in distribution and the existing facts, and adopted simple and crude methods, taking actions of squeezing and exclusion, violating the policy of public-private relations in distribution work. Director Chen's low political level and lack of research on the instructions of his superiors were the reasons for the mistake. His words, attitudes, and work methods were also inappropriate.
    In terms of guiding ideology, the Huaiyin Central Command Bureau did not recognize the policy issue of public-private relations in distribution work after the integration of postal and distribution services to the necessary principled height. Therefore, it vacillated in grasping the policy. Whether in the policy guidance to lower-level post offices or in the local distribution business in Huaiyin, it showed a bias towards excluding and squeezing private newspaper distribution points. What was particularly serious was that after receiving the Yangzhou Post Office's opinion on Wang Jun, it ordered the Lianshui Post Office to take over Wang Jun's subscribers without even studying it. Therefore, the Huaiyin Central Command Bureau is responsible for the bias in the distribution policy of the Lianshui Post Office.
    The Shanghai Postal Administration Bureau's approval of Wang Jun's distribution of the Jiefang Daily in July was based on the viewpoint of carrying out distribution work, and it was basically correct. However, it neither contacted the Lianshui Post Office in advance nor notified the Lianshui Post Office until more than a month later, causing Wang Jun and the Lianshui Post Office to each hold their own opinions on the so-called "legal" issue. Therefore, it should bear the responsibility for incomplete procedures.
    The Jiangsu Postal Administration Bureau also did not pay enough attention to this case. Since June, Wang Jun and other newspaper vendors in Huaiyin had sent more than ten letters to various parties accusing the post office of excluding private newspaper distribution businesses. The Jiangsu Postal Administration Bureau knew about this situation, but did not find a way to solve it. It was not until after Wang Jun's death that his family sent a letter of accusation to the Jiangsu Postal Administration Bureau that they instructed the Huai and Lian post offices to recognize Wang Jun's distribution relationship.
  (4) Handling opinions
    Since the post office cannot be held responsible for Wang Jun's death, the appeals issued by his family are inconsistent with the facts. The Lianshui Post Office has filed a lawsuit with the People's Court of Huaiyin Prefecture, which is still pending legal proceedings. (Editor's note: Wang Jun's family should have the right to express their opinions on the bias in the post office's work. However, it is wrong to adopt this method of distorting facts and issuing indiscriminate letters of accusation. The Lianshui Post Office should mainly solve this problem by correcting the bias in the implementation of newspaper distribution policies, rather than by accusing the other party of false accusations.)
    The number of subscribers Wang Jun had before his death should be returned by the post office, and the heirs of Wang Jun's original distribution point (limited to the family of the deceased) should complete the registration procedures to determine it as the "Lianshui Post Office Newspaper and Periodical Distribution Point" and accept the leadership and management of the Lianshui Post Office. Its distribution area should be limited to the jurisdiction of the Lianshui Post Office.
    The Huaiyin Central Command Bureau should return all the subscribers squeezed from private newspaper vendors by the Huaiyin and its subordinate post offices to the newspaper vendors, and should convene a meeting of newspaper vendors to publicly review and correct the policy and restore the impact. The Huai and Lian bureaus should immediately conduct a comprehensive review and summary of the distribution work since the integration of postal and distribution services in May of this year from a policy perspective.
    Finally, the Huaiyin Post Office should, in accordance with the spirit of the General Bureau's instructions, conscientiously grasp the policy of uniting and improving private newspaper distributors for the feudal monopoly system and the phenomenon of squeezing original post office subscribers by improper means that currently exist in the private distribution points in the area, and establish a distribution policy that takes into account the overall situation, unity and cooperation.

### 关于苏北涟水邮局与私营派报业的纠纷问题

专栏：对人民日报批评的反应

　　关于苏北涟水邮局与私营派报业的纠纷问题
    编者按：去年十一月二十日，我们收到了一封署名“死者家属”的控诉信，控诉苏北涟水邮局局长陈义连，挤顶私人分销处报纸，逼死报贩王俊。同时此信件亦在其他各地发现。我们即将该案转请中央人民监察委员会调查处理。去年十二月三十日，中央人民监察委员会将邮电部对该案初步调查结果告诉我们；今年一月六日，邮电部又把华东邮电管理局等派员调查的详细报告告诉我们。根据两次调查材料，王俊系因严重胃病致死，并非被涟水邮局局长陈义连所逼死。但涟水邮局没有很好掌握发行工作中的公私关系政策，对私营代销处采取排斥、挤顶行动，是事实。这种情况，在目前邮局的发行工作中，应该引起普遍注意。今后为了把报纸发行工作做好，邮政局、报贩、私营代销处必须密切合作。现在为了把涟水邮局同王俊的纠纷事件是非弄清，便于各地邮局及报纸分销业接受这一教训，特将华东邮电管理局的调查报告摘要发表于后。        
  华东邮电管理局“关于涟水报贩王俊死亡案件的调查报告”摘要
  （一）报贩王俊在涟水推销报刊经过
    报贩王俊在涟水推销报纸。一九五○年八月前，因邮局忽视发行工作，王俊在涟水发展了一些订户。七月二十日（指一九五○年，以下亦同），王俊经沪邮管局发行科批准直接发给解放日报，即长住涟水。
    涟水涟东两县合并时，两县邮局亦合并了。涟水邮局根据邮政总局发字三七三号的指示：“代销人的营业范围，以当地邮局辖区为限，不得越区发展业务。”及沪邮局发行解放、劳动、青年三报办法第十五条第三款：“各局所在地之代销商，以在一九五○年五月一日以前已向上海解放日报社建立代销关系为限，今后遇有声请者，应不予接受。”的规定，即认为王等在涟水推销报刊是不合法的。
    八月二十七日，王俊向涟水局加订苏北日报十五份，涟水局不给享受优待。王乃向扬州局请求发报，扬州局允其所请。但涟水邮局收到扬州邮局寄给王俊的报后，拒不收发者共六期。扬州局收到涟水局退报，一面指出涟水局的不当，一面即与王俊发生直发十五份报纸的批销关系。至此，涟水局与王俊之关系日趋恶化。
    九月二十二日，沪邮管局通知涟水邮局已与王俊发生代销关系，并附空白登记书一纸，请涟水局加以领导。涟水局未按沪邮管局意见办理，并不断呈报淮阴中心指挥局及扬州局请撤销王俊代销苏北日报之权利。扬州局在九月二十七日同意涟水局意见，自十一月份停止发报给王俊。淮阴指挥局亦在十月上旬二次令涟水局接收王俊订户。涟水县人民政府等认为这样会使王俊失业，要涟水局先行了解王俊订户状况，再研究处理办法。问题尚未最后决定，王俊即于十月二十二日病逝。
  （二）王俊病死的真实情况
    王俊素有严重胃病。据其二兄王绍青等谈：自一九四九年以来，他生过好几次大病。
    十月十九日午后，王至涟水邮局取报，陈局长即问其发报数字。王所报数字与实际数量不符，陈即随他到仁和客栈索抄发报单；但并未谈起任何接收订户之事，仅称奉上级命令了解发行数字，以便更好的掌握发行工作。
    当晚王俊病发，卧病不起。王自称用老方子吃一二贴药即可，当自身上取出药方，在松寿堂配药。服之无效，二十二日雇车返淮，当夜身死。
    根据上述情形及从涟水县府、县委、公安局、仁和栈、松寿堂等各方证实，王俊之死实为旧病复发，涟水邮局陈局长对此不能负责。
  （三）邮局方面在发行工作中的偏向
    涟水局在邮发合一后，对私营代销人存在两种偏向：前一阶段是忽视发行工作，甚至订户向邮局订报，邮局再转向王俊去订；对私人报贩不闻不问，更谈不上对报贩的领导和管理。后一阶段则机械地强调手续和拘泥于“合法”、“非法”的抽象概念，否认王俊在发行中的成绩和存在的既成事实，而用简单粗鲁的方法，采取挤顶、排斥行动，违反发行工作中公私关系的政策。陈局长政治水平不高，对上级指示缺乏研究，是造成错误的原因。而其言语态度、工作方法方式，也有不妥之处。
    淮阴中心指挥局在领导思想上，对邮发合一后发行工作中公私关系的政策问题，没有提到应有的原则高度来认识。因此，在掌握政策上就摇摆不定。无论在对下级邮局的政策指导上，或在淮阴本地发行业务上，都表现了排斥、挤顶私营派报所的偏向。特别严重的是在该局接到扬州邮局关于王俊的处理意见后，竟未加研究即令涟水邮局接收王俊订户。因此，涟水邮局发行政策发生偏向，淮阴中心指挥局是有责任的。
    沪邮管局在七月批准王俊代销解放日报，而当时涟水局正忽视发行工作。这个决定是从开展发行工作观点出发的，基本上是正确的。但其事先既未与涟水邮局联系，事后又是隔了一个多月才通知涟水邮局，致使王俊与涟水邮局为所谓“合法”问题，各执一端，故应负手续上不完备的责任。
    江苏邮管局对此案件也是不够重视的。六月以来，王俊及淮阴其他报贩向各方发出控诉邮局排斥私营派报业的信件，有十余件之多。江苏邮管局知道这个情况，但未设法解决。直至王俊死后，其家属向江苏邮管局寄去控诉信，他们才指示淮、涟两邮局，承认王俊代销关系。
  （四）处理意见
    王俊之死，邮局既不能负责，其家属发出的呼吁书与事实不符，涟水邮局已向淮阴专署人民法院起诉，尚须待法院依法处理。（编者按：王俊家属对于邮局工作中的偏向是应该提出意见的。但采取这种曲解事实滥发控诉信的方式则是错误的。涟水邮局主要应从纠正执行报纸发行政策上的偏向来解决这个问题，而不是从控诉对方诬告来解决这个问题。）
    王俊死前原有订户数量，应由邮局发还，原王俊代销处之继承人（仅限死者家属）应补行登记手续，确定其为“涟水邮局报刊推销处”，接受涟水邮局之领导和管理。其代销地区，应以涟水邮局辖区为限。
    淮阴中心指挥局在淮阴及所辖之各地邮局所挤顶私人报贩的订户一律退还报贩，并应召开报贩会议，公开检讨，以端正政策、挽回影响。淮、涟两局并应立即将本年五月邮发合一开始后的发行工作，从政策观点来作一全面检讨和总结。
    最后，淮阴邮局对于该地私人推销处目前所存在的封建把持制度以及用不正当方法挤顶原邮局订户等现象，应本着总局指示精神，切实掌握对私营派报业者团结改进的政策，确立统筹兼顾、团结合作的发行方针。
