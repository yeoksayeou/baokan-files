Xinhua News Agency, Montevideo, 26th: According to the Brazilian newspaper "People's Daily," the Brazilian people held large-scale peaceful demonstrations during the anti-war day announced by the Brazilian Peace Committee.

　　In the capital, Rio de Janeiro, demonstrators braved the heavy rain and gathered in front of the parliament. Their delegation delivered the resolutions of the Second World Peace Congress to parliamentarians Campos and Kaurhe. At the rally held in front of the parliament, representatives from the Brazilian Youth Association, the Brazilian Women's Federation, and the Brazilian Workers' Union who attended the Second World Peace Congress, as well as parliamentarians Campos and Kaurhe, delivered speeches. Speakers unanimously emphasized that the Brazilian people opposed wars of aggression and that Brazilian soldiers were unwilling to go to Korea. The rally was followed by a parade. The marchers held anti-war banners and shouted, "We want peace!"

　　Peaceful demonstrations were also held in São Paulo. Demonstrators gathered in front of the state legislature, presenting a petition to state legislators, along with 1.6 million signatures from the people of São Paulo in support of the Stockholm Appeal. The Vice-Speaker of the State Legislature, representing the legislature, accepted the petition and said that the legislature would read the petition at its next meeting, and he hoped that the legislature "will definitely pass a resolution against sending troops to Korea, because the majority of legislators have this opinion."

　　Similar rallies and demonstrations were also held in Recife and other cities.

　　On the eve of the anti-war day, the Brazilian government ordered the prohibition of broadcasting the program of peace advocates, and the police arrested some of the peaceful demonstrators.

    在圣保罗城也举行了和平示威。示威者聚集州议会之前，向州议员呈递请愿书，并附有圣保罗人民一百六十万个拥护斯德哥尔摩宣言的签名。该州州议会副议长代表州议会接受请愿书时说，州议会将在下次会议上宣读这个请愿书，他希望议会“一定会通过反对派兵到朝鲜去的决议，因为大多数议员都有这种意见”。
