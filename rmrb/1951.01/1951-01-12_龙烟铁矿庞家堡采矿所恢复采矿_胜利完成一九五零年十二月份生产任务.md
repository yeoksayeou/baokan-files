　　Longyan Iron Mine Pangjiabao Mining Area Resumes Mining
    Successfully Completes December 1950 Production Task
    [This Newspaper News] With the concerted efforts of all staff and workers, and after more than a year of active repair and reconstruction, the Pangjiabao Mining Area (now renamed the Mining Area) of Longyan Iron Mine officially resumed mining in December 1950. In the upsurge of the patriotic production competition of the miners to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, the December production task was successfully completed. They are now redoubling their efforts to realize the production tasks for 1951.
    The ore from the Pangjiabao Iron Mine has an average iron content of over 55 percent. After the Japanese invaders occupied it, they drove Chinese "laborers" to carry out plundering mining in order to meet the urgent needs of their war of aggression. With the blood and sweat of the Chinese working people, they built modern equipment such as fan rooms, horse-drawn tracks, cableways, electric tram ore transportation routes, pump rooms, and substations. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War in 1945, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang launched a heinous civil war, and this equipment was severely damaged. After being liberated again at the end of 1948, the mine suffered damage and theft again by illegal elements due to insufficient construction thinking and poor management by local cadres, turning the mine into a pile of rubble.
    In July 1949, the destructive phenomena were stopped, and repairs and reconstruction were started on the ruins. During the construction, the People's Liberation Army and nearby farmers gave great help, and all the mine's employees made arduous and active efforts. Engineering and technical personnel also went deep into the tunnels and on-site to work with the workers. After more than a year of work, Pangjiabao was revived! The mechanical and electrical equipment has reached 80 percent of the Japanese puppet era; more than 50,000 square meters of buildings have been constructed, reaching the old scale. Except for a few abandoned ones, the remaining old tunnels have all been completely repaired. In addition, a new construction area has been developed, creating conditions for large-scale regular mining in the future.

　　龙烟铁矿庞家堡采矿所恢复采矿
    胜利完成一九五零年十二月份生产任务
    【本报讯】在全体职工一致努力下，经年余积极修复重建，龙烟铁矿庞家堡矿场（现改称采矿所）已于一九五○年十二月正式恢复采矿。在矿工们抗美援朝的爱国生产竞赛的热潮中，十二月份生产任务胜利完成。现正为实现一九五一年的生产任务而加倍努力。
    庞家堡铁矿场矿石含铁量平均在百分之五十五以上。日寇侵占后，为供应其侵略战争的急需，驱使中国“劳工”作抢掠式的采掘。用中国劳动人民的血汗，建造起风机房、马机道、索道、电车运矿路、水泵房、变电所等近代化设备。一九四五年抗日胜利，不久蒋匪帮又发动了罪恶的内战，这些设备备遭严重破坏。一九四八年年底重获解放后，复由于地方干部建设思想不足，看管不善，再次遭到不法分子的破坏、偷盗，致使矿山变为一片瓦砾。
    一九四九年七月，破坏现象被制止。并即在废墟上着手进行修复、重建。修建中，人民解放军和附近农民们给予了大力帮助，全矿职工更进行了艰苦的积极的努力。工程技术人员也深入坑道、现场，和工友一起努力工作。一年多工夫，庞家堡又复活了！机电设备上，已达日伪时代的百分之八十；房屋建筑五万余平方米，已达旧有规模。旧坑道除少数废弃者外，其余全部清修完竣。此外，并开拓了新工程区，为今后大规模的正规开采创设了条件。
