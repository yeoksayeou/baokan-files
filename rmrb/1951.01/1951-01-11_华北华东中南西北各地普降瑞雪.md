Xinhua News Agency, January 9th: Since New Year's Day, North China has been blessed with continuous snowfall, which only stopped on the 8th, covering the mountains and fields in a blanket of silver. Hebei Province experienced the heaviest snowfall in the North China region. In the Shijiazhuang, Handan, Xingtai, and Tongxian regions, the snowfall reached five inches to one foot. Beijing and Tianjin accumulated eight to ten millimeters of snow. Shanxi and Chahar provinces received approximately one to two inches of snow. This heavy snow is the first significant snowfall in North China since the beginning of winter last year, and it is highly beneficial to various winter crops. It is also advantageous for killing insect eggs in the winter-plowed fields and preparing for spring plowing and sowing. A bumper harvest of spring wheat is expected in the entire region this year.

Xinhua News Agency, January 10th: Heavy snow has fallen in East China, Central South, and Northwest China since the beginning of this month, much to the delight of farmers everywhere. The snowfall covers the Subei, Sunan, Wannan, and Zhejiang provinces in East China; Henan, Hubei, and Hunan provinces in Central South China; and Shaanxi and Ningxia provinces in Northwest China. Hunan Province experienced heavy snow throughout the entire province, with the highest accumulation reaching three inches.

According to experienced farmers, this heavy snow is greatly beneficial for loosening the soil and promoting the growth of winter crops. It can freeze to death pests in the winter-plowed land and significantly reduce insect and drought disasters this spring, greatly benefiting the growth of spring wheat sown last winter in various regions.

　　华北华东中南西北各地普降瑞雪
    【新华社九日讯】今年元旦以来华北各地瑞雪纷飞，至八日始停；漫山遍野一片银白。此次冬雪以河北省较大。石家庄、邯郸、邢台、通县等专区降雪量达五寸至一尺；北京和天津积雪八至十公厘。山西和察哈尔省降雪量约一、二寸。此次大雪为华北区去年入冬以来首次瑞雪，对各种冬季作物裨益甚大。对杀灭冬耕地上的虫卵和进行春耕播种也很有利。全区春麦今年可望丰收。
    【新华社十日讯】华东、中南、西北等地本月初旬普降大雪，各地农民莫不额首称庆。落雪地区遍及华东的苏北区、苏南区、皖南区、浙江省；中南的河南省、湖北省、湖南省；西北的陕西省、宁夏省。其中湖南省全境大雪。积雪最高者达三寸。
    据老农谈，此次大雪，对土壤的松软和冬季农作物的发育有很大的好处，能将曾冬耕过的土地上的害虫冻死，并可大大减轻今春的虫、旱灾害，对各地去冬播种的春麦生长裨益更大。
