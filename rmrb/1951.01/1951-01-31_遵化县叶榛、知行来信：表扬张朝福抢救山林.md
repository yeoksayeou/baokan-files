Ye Zhen and Zhi Xing of Zunhua County write:
    Praising Zhang Chaofu for Rescuing the Mountain Forest
    The Chanlin Temple Village in the ninth district of Zunhua County, Hebei Province, is surrounded by mountains, with about 400,000 pine and cypress trees growing there. At the end of last year, bad elements set fire to the mountain, but fortunately, Zhang Chaofu, a villager, saw it. Zhang immediately organized the masses to fight the fire, saving 400,000 pine and cypress trees from being destroyed by the fire. After the wildfire was extinguished, Zhang Chaofu, fearing that the embers would reignite, guarded the area alone for half the night in the bitter cold of winter. We believe that Zhang Chaofu's spirit of cherishing public property demonstrates the virtues of the people of New China and should be commended.

　　遵化县叶榛、知行来信：
    表扬张朝福抢救山林
    河北省遵化县第九区禅林寺村周围都是山地，长满着松柏树约四十余万棵。去年年底有坏分子放火烧山，幸为该村村民张朝福看见，张即组织群众奋力扑救，得使四十万棵松柏免遭火劫。野火被扑灭后，张朝福唯恐死灰复燃，还在严寒的冬天独自看守了半夜。我们认为：张朝福这种爱护公共财产的精神，表现了新中国人民的美德，应加表扬。
