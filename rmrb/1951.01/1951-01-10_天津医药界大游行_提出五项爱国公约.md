Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 8th: The Tianjin medical community held a massive patriotic parade on the 7th of this month to resist America, aid Korea, and celebrate the liberation of Seoul. Participants included over 6,500 people from 80+ units: public and private hospitals, clinics, nursing schools, midwifery schools, medical colleges, the Medical Workers' Union, Traditional Chinese Medicine, Western medicine, and pharmaceutical industry associations. They included department doctors, nurses, pharmacists, medical college faculty and students, and pharmaceutical factory workers and capitalists.

In the colorful parade waving red flags, leading the way for their respective units were nationally renowned Zhang Jizheng, Director of the private Tianhe Hospital and thoracic surgery expert; Fang Xianzhi, Director of the private Orthopedic Hospital; Dr. Yang Jishi, an internal medicine physician; Tian Dawen, Director of the Tianjin Prevention of Blindness Hospital and ophthalmology expert; Lu Guanhai, a famous traditional Chinese medicine doctor; Yang Yilin, Chairman of the Tianjin Western Medicine Manufacturing Industry Association; Liu Huapu, Chairman of the National Medicine Industry Association; and Wan Fu'en, a surgical expert newly returned from the Korean front. They marched spiritedly on the snow-covered streets in a sub-zero wind of minus ten degrees Celsius. Of the city's 800+ traditional Chinese medicine doctors, 721 rushed to participate. Many TCM doctors in their seventies marched in the ranks, supported by their grandchildren. The white-haired and venerable TCM doctor Zhai Yonggong excitedly and tremulously raised his hand, shouting "Down with American Imperialism." Young nurses cheerfully performed the Yangko dance, beat gongs and drums, jumping and singing on the icy streets. Spectators lined the streets, cheering the parading crowds. Many businesses set off firecrackers and presented them with flowers as a sign of respect.

Before the parade began, all participants held a gathering and passed the大会宣言 (Da Hui Xuan Yan) [General Assembly Declaration], a letter to Chairman Mao, and congratulatory telegrams to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army. The大会宣言 (Da Hui Xuan Yan) [General Assembly Declaration] proposed five patriotic pledges for the Tianjin medical community: (1) Promote a high degree of patriotism and internationalism, and actively participate in medical rescue work to resist America and aid Korea. (2) Establish a worldview of serving the people, contribute technology to the working people and soldiers, and have a high degree of responsibility for mass hygiene and the sick and wounded, and promote revolutionary humanitarianism. (3) Strengthen the unity of the city's medical community and be ready to respond to the government's call at any time. (4) Intensify production, work hard, strive for self-sufficiency in medicine and medical equipment, and ensure the good quality of medicine. (5) Strengthen the study of current events and politics, overcome purely technical viewpoints, eliminate pro-American, worship-American, and fear-American thoughts; hate, despise, and scorn American imperialism, humbly learn from the advanced scientific experience of the Soviet Union, and consolidate Sino-Soviet friendship.
