Xinhua News Agency, 6th—The Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government has recently issued a decision on conducting land surveys and yield assessments in newly liberated areas in conjunction with land reform. The decision points out that, according to past experience in various regions, verifying land acreage and accurately assessing land yield are the basis for implementing the agricultural tax law and achieving a fair and reasonable burden. All newly liberated areas should, after the autumn tax collection, universally conduct land surveys and yield assessments in conjunction with rent reduction or land reform work. The financial and economic committees of the major administrative regions should pay attention to this work and, in consultation with relevant parties, arrange for the land survey and yield assessment work to be carried out together when conducting rent reduction or land reform. Governments at all levels should strengthen leadership and inspection of this work.

　　中央财经委员会发布决定  新区普行查田评产
    【新华社六日讯】中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会，已于日前发布了关于新区结合土地改革进行查田评产的决定。决定指出：根据以往各地的经验证明，查实田亩和评好土地的产量，是贯彻农业税法和实现公平合理负担的基础。各个新区应在秋征后，结合减租或土地改革工作，普遍进行查田评产。各大行政区的财经委员会应该重视这个工作，并商请有关方面在进行减租或土地改革时，将查田评产的工作一并布置下去。各级政府应对此项工作加以领导和检查。
