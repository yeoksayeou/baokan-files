　　State-owned Trading Companies and Cooperatives Across the Country
    Vigorously Carry Out Spring Festival Materials Exchange
    [Dispatch from this newspaper] State-owned trading companies, cooperatives at all levels, and some organized private businesses across the country have launched materials exchange work, focusing on preparing for the Spring Festival, before the holiday. In the lively urban-rural trade, a large number of industrial and agricultural products were exchanged. In particular, many local products such as dates, daylily, bamboo chopsticks, etc., found sales markets through this large-scale exchange.
    State-owned trading companies in various places have taken the lead to meet the needs of the broad masses of people. The China South District Department Store has prepared towels, socks, soap, sugar, etc. The Finance Committee of the China South District instructed the salt companies to prepare 500,000 dan of salt in conjunction with the local product companies to exchange for agricultural products such as ramie, tobacco leaves, and salted fish which were needed for the Spring Festival. Among the New Year goods prepared by department stores in various parts of Northeast China, in addition to knitted daily necessities, there are also seasonings, non-staple foods, and main groceries, such as 100,000 jin of peppercorns, 170,000 jin of brown sugar, 70,000 jin of seaweed, 400,000 jin of maoxia shrimp, as well as bowls, chopsticks, and porcelain prepared by Heilongjiang Province Department Store. In addition, 2,000 bolts of red paper and 60,000 packages of foreign candles were processed in Harbin. The Hebei Province Department Store added one or two hundred kinds of new goods to supply for the New Year's needs. In addition to continuing to carry out exchange and credit purchases before the festival, the province's cotton yarn company also appropriately released currency to meet the needs of farmers to purchase non-staple foods. The Beijing and Tianjin department stores, native produce companies, and trust companies have also made supplying New Year's goods the focus of their current business. The department store transferred a total value of 3 billion yuan of seafood, sugar, etc. The native produce company shipped a batch of bamboo chopsticks from Hankou and sea cucumbers and fish maw from Qingdao. The trust company is preparing to sell 4,000 fat pigs on behalf of the Northeast. The Tianjin Department Store extended its business hours by half an hour due to crowded customers.
    Cooperatives in various places also purchased a large number of New Year's goods under the policy of serving their members. The Songjiang Provincial Federation of Cooperatives in Northeast China actively cooperated with state-owned commercial enterprises to uniformly purchase New Year's goods for the province's members in a planned manner. Among them, the purchase of jujubes alone from inside the customs amounted to 200,000 jin. The Tianjin Municipal Cooperative Federation went to Dingxian County to purchase 3,000 jin of daylily and 250 pigs. Some New Year goods such as vermicelli, dates, and sesame oil have begun to be distributed. The Beijing Municipal Cooperative Federation purchased 5.4 million jin of rice, 50,000 jin of white sugar, 180,000 jin of pork and mutton, and red dates and sesame oil for its members. Cooperatives at all levels in Tongxian Prefecture added approximately 150 kinds of New Year's goods and held small exhibitions in conjunction with the exchanged local products.
    Cooperative warehouses in Tianjin, Beijing, Shijiazhuang, and other places fully played the role of a link in the pre-holiday material exchange, and organized vertical and horizontal exchanges through them. The Tianjin North China Cooperative Warehouse sold more than 7.7 billion yuan worth of local products for cooperatives in various places in 20 days, and at the same time purchased more than 10 billion yuan worth of knitwear, New Year's goods, etc. on their behalf. The daily purchase and sale volume of the warehouse's dry and fresh goods warehouse reached more than 600 million yuan.
    Organizing private businesses to carry out New Year's goods exchange to supplement the inadequacy of state-owned trading companies and cooperatives is also an important task. Beijing, Xinxiang, and other places have successively carried out this work. Beijing has organized flour, oil, local food, pig soup pot, cattle and sheep, vegetables, fresh fish, and other industries to purchase wheat, sesame, fruit, red dates, persimmon cakes, pigs, and sheep from various places. Xinxiang City also organized more than 50 private businesses into seven operating units to carry out material exchange focusing on New Year's goods. Beijing also organized a number of vendors to transport New Year's goods to markets in the suburbs to meet the needs of farmers in the suburbs.
    In the material exchange centered on New Year's goods, in addition to exchanges in neighboring areas, there are also long-distance transportation and sales, such as those who came from Qinghai, Dihua, Lanzhou, Chengdu, Hankou, and other places to purchase New Year's goods in Tianjin. During this period, there was also a large amount of local product exchange between inside and outside the customs.
    Facts have proved that the purchasing power of our country's farmers has increased after the bumper harvest. According to some materials shipped to the cotton-producing areas of Hebei, such as thermos bottles, soap, toothpaste, towels, etc., as well as Tianjin, Northeast and other places' New Year's paintings and plum red paper (for writing Spring Festival couplets) are in short supply, which shows that increasingly wealthy farmers are happily welcoming the Spring Festival.

　　各地国营贸易公司和合作社
    大力开展春节物资交流
    【本报讯】全国各地国营贸易公司、各级合作社和部分组织起来的私营商业，在春节以前，展开了以备办年货为重心的物资交流工作。在活泼的城乡贸易中，交换了大批的工农业产品，特别是很多地区的土产品，如枣、黄花菜、竹筷等，经过这种较大规模的交流，找到了销售的市场。
    各地国营贸易公司，为满足广大人民的需要，首先活动起来。中南区百货公司准备了毛巾、袜子、香皂、食糖等；中南区财委会为协助农民推销苎麻、烟叶、咸鱼等换回春节所需的食盐，特指示盐业公司备盐五十万担，结合土产公司进行换购。东北区各地百货公司准备的年货中，除针织日用品以外，还有调味品、副食品及主要的杂货，如黑龙江省百货公司备有花椒十万斤、红糖十七万斤、海菜七万斤、毛虾四十万斤和碗、筷、磁器等。此外还在哈市加工红纸二千匹、洋蜡六万包。河北省百货公司为供应年节需要，添备了一、二百种新货，该省花纱布公司在节前除继续进行换购、赊购外，并适当投放货币，以应农民购买副食品的需要。京、津两市百货、土产、信托等公司，也都把供应年货作为当前的业务重心。百货公司调运到总值三十亿元的海味、糖类等；土产公司由汉口运来竹筷一批及由青岛运来海参、鱼肚等。信托公司准备代替东北推销肥猪四千口。天津市百货公司，因顾客拥挤而延长半小时营业时间。
    各地合作社在为社员服务的方针下，亦大量地采办年货。东北区松江省联社，积极配合国营商业统一为全省社员有计划地采办年货，其中只乌枣一项，就向关内换购二十万斤。天津市合作总社，去定县采买黄花菜三千斤，猪二百五十口，部分年货如粉条、枣、香油等已开始配售。北京市合作总社为社员购备大米五百四十万斤、白糖五万斤、猪、羊肉十八万斤及红枣、香油等。通县专区各级合作社添办约一百五十种年货，并配合交换来的土产，举行小型展览会。
    天津、北京、石家庄等地的合作货栈，在节前物资交流中，充分地发挥了纽带作用，通过它，组织了纵横的交换。天津华北合作货栈，在二十天内就为各地合作社推销了总值七十余亿元的土产，同时代替他们采购了百余亿元的针织品、年货等。该栈所属的干鲜货栈，一天的购销额即达六亿余元。
    组织私营商业进行年货交流，补助国营贸易公司、合作社力量的不足，也是重要的工作之一。北京、新乡等地先后进行了这一工作。北京曾组织面粉、油脂、土产食品、猪汤锅、牛羊、蔬菜、鲜鱼等行业，分别到各地采购小麦、芝麻、水果、红枣、柿饼、猪、羊等。新乡市也组织了五十余家私商分七个经营单位，进行以年货为主的物资交流。北京市还组织了一部摊贩办运年货到近郊集市设摊，以供应郊区农民之需。
    在以办年货为中心的物资交流中，除邻近区域的交换外，还有长途运销，如到天津采购年货的，有远自青海、迪化、兰州、成都、汉口等地而来的。关内外在这一时期中也有较大数量的土产交流。
    事实证明，丰收后的我国农民的购买力是提高了。根据输往河北棉产区的部分物资如：暖水瓶、香皂、牙膏、毛巾等，以及天津、东北等地新年画、梅红纸的（写春联用）供不应求，说明日益富裕的农民是在愉快地迎接着春节。
