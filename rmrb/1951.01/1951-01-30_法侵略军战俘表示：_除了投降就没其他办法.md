[Reported by] Vietnam News Agency: The strength and courage of the Vietnamese People's Army have been greatly admired by all French and foreign officers captured on the Vinh Yen front. Captain Picard, a French officer captured by the Vietnamese People's Army on the northeast battlefield of Vinh Yen at the end of December last year, told a reporter from "Voice of Vietnam" radio that the French army's failure was due to being tightly surrounded by the Vietnamese People's Army, and the Vietnamese People's Army's firepower was very accurate and well-coordinated. He said: "Although more than two hundred African soldiers maintained an organized formation, the actions of the Vietnamese People's Army were so powerful and rapid that we had no other choice but to surrender instinctively." Picard said: "I was captured in the Lien Son area, and therefore saw firsthand the bravery, training, and powerful equipment of the Vietnamese People's Army. I now understand that we can never build such an army; therefore, my capture is not surprising." A French lieutenant who commanded the Second Battalion of the Eighth Artillery Regiment complained that aircraft and artillery lost their effectiveness due to the high spirit of bravery of the Vietnamese People's Army, who were not afraid to engage in hand-to-hand combat with African troops. He also said that at eight o'clock in the morning, two "old lady-style" (Morane-type aircraft) flew over the battlefield, but by then the battle was already over. He also said painfully: "Our artillery units were useless; they only bombarded French soldiers who had already been captured by the People's Army, and they also concentrated their fire and killed thirty Africans in the rice fields." He finally said: "I once received the Legion of Honor medal (established by Napoleon), but now I have learned many lessons from the war. This is the most painful defeat I have felt in my twenty years of service. We can never achieve victory on your land."

　　法侵略军战俘表示：“除了投降就没其他办法”
    【本报讯】据越南通讯社讯：越南人民军的力量和勇气，已为在永安前线被俘的所有法国与外国军官们极度钦佩。去年十二月底在永安东北战场上被越南人民军俘获的毕卡特上尉，向“越南之声”电台记者表示，法军的失败，是由于他们被越南人民军紧紧包围，而越南人民军的火力又是十分准确并且合作良好。他说：“虽然二百名以上的非洲士兵仍保持着有组织的队形，但越南人民军的行动是如此地有力与迅速，以至使我们除了本能地投降以外就无其他办法。”毕卡特说：“我是在连山地区被俘的，因而亲眼看到了越南人民军的英勇、有训练和有力的装备。我现在已经明白，我们永远不能建立这样的军队；因此我的被俘是并不奇怪的。”一个指挥过第八炮兵团第二营的法军中尉埋怨道：因为不怕与非洲军队进行肉搏战的越南人民军的高度英勇的精神，飞机与大炮失去了效用。他并说：在早上八点钟，两架“老太太式”（莫兰式飞机）飞临战场上空，但那时战斗却早已结束了。他还痛苦地说：“我们的炮兵部队是毫无用处的，它们只会轰击已被人民军俘掳的法军士兵，而且还集中火力，击毙了在稻田中的三十名非洲人。”他最后说：“我曾经得到过荣誉团的奖章（按为拿破仑所创设的勋章），但是现在我已从战争中得到许多教训，这是我入伍二十年以来从没感到的最痛苦的失败，我们永远不能在你们的土地上得到胜利。”
