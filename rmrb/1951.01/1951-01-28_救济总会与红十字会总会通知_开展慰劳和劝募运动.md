Xinhua News Agency, 27th — The Relief Administration and Red Cross Society of China have jointly issued a notice to assist in carrying out the fundraising campaign initiated by the China Peace Committee to Comfort the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army and to Relieve Korean Refugees. The full text of the notice is as follows:

　　In order to comfort the heroic Chinese and Korean people's soldiers who are fighting bravely in the frozen fields of Korea, and to relieve the Korean refugees who are suffering from the ravages of American imperialism and lack clothing and food, the China Peace Committee has already joined with our two organizations to launch a large-scale campaign throughout the country to collect comfort goods and relief supplies. In order to assist in carrying out this large-scale fundraising campaign, so that comfort goods and relief funds and materials can be quickly concentrated and transported, and to strive to complete this major and urgent task in the shortest possible time, our two organizations hereby jointly issue the following notice:

　　1. Local relief branches and Red Cross branches should take the initiative to assist local and large branches of the China Peace Committee (in areas where there are no branches of the China Peace Committee, they should unite with other people's organizations) in vigorously launching a campaign to collect comfort goods and relief supplies in accordance with the instructions in the China Peace Committee's notice of January 14th.

　　2. In terms of propaganda work, we should first mobilize the staff and members of our two organizations, unite with other organized masses, and widely launch a propaganda campaign to the people in various parts of the country:

　　　　1. Explain the heroic and selfless spirit of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army in fighting and defeating the American imperialist aggressor army, laying a solid foundation for world peace.

　　　　2. Explain that patriotism must be combined with internationalism, and that comforting the Chinese and Korean people's soldiers and relieving Korean refugees is a part of the movement to Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect Our Homes, and Defend Our Country.

　　　　3. Explain that relieving Korean refugees is a concrete manifestation of the spirit of "self-help and helping others" and "revolutionary humanitarianism."

　　3. In the process of collecting and transporting comfort goods and relief funds and materials, we should try our best to draw out manpower, free up housing, and provide all possible conditions to assist the China Peace Committee branches in solving various difficulties, so as to ensure that comfort goods and relief materials can be transported to Korea in a timely manner as soon as possible.

　　4. In fundraising work, we should combine it with various patriotic activities such as Resisting America, Aiding Korea, and production competitions, and use the Lunar New Year period to call on the broad masses of the people to save money and donate through newspapers and radio stations, and mobilize movie theaters, performing arts troupes, music teams, sports associations, and other entertainment venues to organize charity performances and sales.

　　With regard to the above items, it is hoped that local relief branches and Red Cross branches will form joint offices with the China Peace Committee branches to earnestly handle and complete the tasks, and report the progress of the handling to the General Administration separately at any time.

    １、说明中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军的英勇作战不畏艰苦的精神，打败美帝国主义侵略军，给世界和平奠定了巩固的基础。
    ２、说明爱国主义必须与国际主义相结合，慰劳中朝人民战士和救济朝鲜难民就是抗美援朝保家卫国运动的一部分。
    ３、说明救济朝鲜难民就是“自救助人”、“革命的人道主义”精神的具体表现。
    三、在慰劳品和救济款物的收集及运输的过程中，应尽量抽出人力、腾出房舍及提供一切可能的条件，协助中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会分会解决各种困难，务使慰劳品与救济物资能及时的早日运到朝鲜。
    四、在募集工作上，应多方结合抗美援朝及生产竞赛各种爱国主义的活动，并利用农历春节时期，通过报纸和电台，号召广大人民节约捐助，发动电影戏院、文工团、音乐队、体育会及其他娱乐场所组织义演义卖。
    以上各项，希各地救济分会与红十字会分会与中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会分会筹组联合办事机构，切实办理，完成任务，并将办理经过情况随时分别向总会作报告。
