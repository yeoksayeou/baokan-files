　　Communication Group That Broke Through Three Blockades
    Cheng Yongxiang
    Northeast of Guicheng in Korea, there is a towering mountain with steep cliffs. Thick black smoke rose from the mountaintop, piercing the sky. Pine trees and reeds were burning. The red leaves on the mountainside swayed in the mountain wind, like thousands of military flags waving. A communication squad of a certain regiment of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, tasked with the extremely important and urgent mission of "breaking through three enemy blockades within four hours to deliver orders to the vanguard of a certain battalion," appeared in that red-leafed forest as the sun was setting. Squad leader Na Qingchun was in the lead, with communicators Da Liu and Xiao Tang behind, keeping a distance of twenty or thirty meters, crawling forward. All three of them stared with bloodshot eyes, having not slept for several nights, constantly looking around. Just as they reached the mountainside, Na Qingchun in the lead suddenly gestured downward repeatedly. Da Liu and Xiao Tang quickly lay down in the grass. At this moment, seven sneaky American soldiers emerged from the reeds fifty or sixty meters away, walking towards them. Judging from the way those seven guys were talking as they walked, it could be concluded that they hadn't discovered that they were facing the "infamous" Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldiers. The American soldiers were getting closer and closer. The three of them calculated: "Thirty meters, twenty meters, ten meters," "Fire, fire, fire!" Da Liu fired a burst of submachine gun bullets; five of the seven American soldiers fell. Xiao Tang jumped up and fired a burst as well, and the two American soldiers who dropped their guns and ran also went to see "God." Na Qingchun quickly jumped up, waved his hand, and the three of them ran forward along the reed marsh. Just as they reached the stone cliff by the highway, a sudden burst of machine gun fire came head-on. Then, gunfire also rang out from the right side, and bullets whizzed past their heads. Seeing the urgency of the situation, Na Qingchun shouted loudly, "We volunteered for today's mission, and we must complete it even if we have only one breath left. The enemy's machine guns are sweeping lower and lower, let's roll down the stone cliff on the left!" After Na Qingchun finished speaking, he rolled down the steep cliff on the left side, which was a foot or two high, without hesitation. Xiao Tang also rolled down in the same way. When Da Liu rolled to the middle of the stone cliff, he was hit by a volley of gunfire from the open ground east of the highway and was wounded. By the time he rolled to the bottom, he was covered in blood. Na Qingchun quickly carried Da Liu on his back, climbed over the highway, and went to a mountain ditch, took out a bandage to bandage Da Liu. At this time, in order to prevent the enemy from discovering the wounded Da Liu, Xiao Tang ran intermittently along the winding mountain ditch to a place four or five hundred meters away from Da Liu, and fought "guerrilla warfare" with the enemy. Xiao Tang fired two or three shots, which provoked the group of American soldiers to fire a large barrage of machine guns and automatic rifles.
    Na Qingchun took the opportunity to bandage Da Liu's wound and hid him in a tightly covered pile of weeds, then chased after Xiao Tang. The two climbed up the edge of the ditch, using the grass in the open space to hide and crawl forward. The enemy's machine gun fire was gradually approaching, and bullets landed near them, spitting out dirt and smoke. They lay there waiting for an opportunity to pass through. "Boom, boom!" Three tanks crawled from the open ground above, firing wildly. Xiao Tang said, "Get ready, the dumb ox is coming..." The word "coming" had just been spoken when he was hit in the left arm by the enemy's machine gun, and fresh blood flowed down his sleeve. Xiao Tang was anxious, but he didn't say a word, took out a grenade, and threw one to the left and one to the right at the tanks. The devils behind the tanks were in chaos, shouting. Na Qingchun climbed to the side of the largest of the three tanks, and with a combination of grenades and submachine gun fire, "called the names" of the dozen or so American soldiers behind the tank's "armor plate," then climbed onto the tank, opened the iron lid, and threw the last grenade inside. "Boom...", the ammunition and gasoline in the "dumb ox's" belly exploded. At that time, thick black smoke enveloped the entire open space, and the other two "dumb oxen" quickly fled in the smoke.
    Na Qingchun searched for a long time in the smoke before finding Xiao Tang lying unconscious in a pool of blood in a patch of grass that was deeper than anyone's head. Xiao Tang was still holding his gun tightly in his hand. A dozen steps away from him lay the stiff bodies of two American soldiers. Na Qingchun shouted several times "Xiao Tang, Xiao Tang," but couldn't hear Xiao Tang respond. He could only temporarily suppress the anger in his chest and complete the important and urgent task.
    It gradually got dark, and when it was so dark that you couldn't see your fingers, the "start the general offensive" signal flares rose in the pitch-black sky, foreshadowing that the group of brutal American soldiers who entrusted their lives to "God" had reached the time to meet "God." The sound of cannons, gunfire, and charging rose sharply with the signal flares. Na Qingchun's energy was even greater at this time, and he headed straight for the open space where Xiao Tang was wounded with his submachine gun. He ran into the enemy in a meadow and fired a burst of submachine gun bullets, and four or five American soldiers fell. Na Qingchun suddenly felt his left leg numb and cold, felt his cotton pants were soaked through, with blood, pain, ignoring everything, he still gritted his teeth and fired one burst of bullets after another, repeatedly repelling three enemy offensives. A dozen American soldiers were killed by Na Qingchun's submachine gun, becoming dead ghosts who "long-term occupied Korea." With a "boom," the sound of artillery fire stunned Na Qingchun, who had lost too much blood. When he woke up, he was already being carried on a stretcher. The sound of victory songs rising everywhere replaced the sound of guns and cannons, and he was so excited that he forgot the pain of his injuries and sang along with the songs: "We are soldiers fighting for peace and justice, resolutely driving out the brutal enemy and traitors!..."

　　冲破三道封锁的通讯组
    程永项
    在朝鲜的龟城东北，有一座峭壁悬崖的大山，山头上升起了浓黑的烟柱，直插天空。松林、山苇在燃烧。山腰上一片红的树叶被山风吹得摇摇摆摆，就像千万面军旗在招展。志愿军某团的一个通讯小组，担负着“必须在四小时内通过敌人三道封锁，把命令送到先锋某营”的非常重要而紧急的任务，在太阳压在西山的时候，出现在那片红叶树林里。组长那庆春在前，通讯员大刘和小唐在后，拉开二、三十公尺的距离，匍匐前进。三个人都瞪圆了几夜没入睡的腥红的眼睛，不住地东张西望。刚走到山腰，在前边的那庆春突然连连向下打手势，大刘、小唐急忙卧倒在草丛里。这时从离他们五、六十公尺远的山苇里钻出七个鬼头鬼脑的美国兵，向他三个人走来。看那七个家伙一边走一边叽叽咕咕说话的样子，可以断定他们没发现面前就是他们“闻名丧胆”的中国人民志愿军战士。美国兵越来越走近了，他三个人算着：“三十公尺、二十公尺、十公尺”，“打，打，打！”大刘一梭子冲锋枪子弹打出去了；七个美国兵躺下五个。小唐跳起，也是一梭子，那两个丢下枪就跑的美国兵也去见“上帝”了。那庆春急忙跳起，一摆手，三个人就顺着山苇甸子往前跑去。刚到公路边的石崖上，猛的一阵机枪响声迎面而来。接着右边也有枪声响起来，子弹流子擦头顶“叽叽叽”地叫。那庆春见情况紧急，就大声喊起来：“今天任务是咱们向上级要求的，有一口活气也要完成任务。敌人的机枪扫得越来越低了，咱们往左边的石崖下滚吧！”那庆春说完，就向左边眼见一两丈高的陡崖子毫没犹豫地滚了下去，小唐也照样滚了下来。当大刘滚到石崖中腰的时候，被公路东边开阔地里来的一排枪打得挂了彩，滚到下边的时候已成一个血人了。那庆春急忙把大刘背在背上，爬过公路，到一个山沟里，拿出裹伤包给大刘包扎。这时小唐为了不让敌人发现负伤的大刘，就顺着弯曲的山沟时隐时现地跑出离大刘有四、五百公尺的地方，和敌人打“游击”。小唐放了两三枪，就惹得那群美国兵连机枪带自动步枪放了一大阵。
    那庆春趁空把大刘的伤口包扎好，把他隐藏在一个严密的杂草堆里，随后追上了小唐。两个人爬上沟沿，借着开阔地方的草丛隐身匍匐前进。敌人的机枪声渐渐逼近了，子弹落在他俩附近，噗噗噗地直冒土和烟，他俩卧在那里等机会通过。“轰隆，轰隆！”由开阔地上头爬来三个坦克，疯狂地放着炮。小唐说：“准备好，笨牛来……”“来”字刚出口，就叫敌人的机枪打中左膀子，鲜血顺着袖口流了出来。小唐可急了，一声没吭，摘下手榴弹，左一个右一个向坦克抛去。坦克后边的鬼子都乱作一团，叫嚷起来。那庆春爬到三个坦克中最大的一个的侧面，连手榴弹带冲锋枪，把坦克“避弹板”后边的十几个美国兵都“点了名”，随后就爬上坦克，拉开铁盖子，把最后的一个手榴弹丢了进去。“轰隆隆……”，那“笨牛”肚子里的弹药、汽油都爆炸了。当时浓黑的硝烟笼罩了整个开阔地，另外的两个“笨牛”，在浓烟中赶快就逃跑了。
    那庆春在硝烟里寻找了半天，才在一片没人深的草丛里，找见躺在血泊中不省人事的小唐。小唐手里还紧紧地抓着枪。离他十几步远僵卧着两个美国兵的死尸。那庆春连喊几声“小唐，小唐”，听不到小唐答应，他只有暂时忍住胸中的怒火，去完成了重要而紧急的任务。
    天渐渐的黑了，直到伸手不见五指的时候，漆黑的天空里升起了的“开始总攻”的信号弹，它预示：那群残暴的把生命寄托给“上帝”的美国兵们，去见“上帝”的时候到了。炮声，枪声，冲杀声，随着信号弹嚣然而起。那庆春在这时劲头更大了，他提着冲锋枪直奔小唐负伤的开阔地摸来，在一片草甸里和敌人碰了头，一梭子冲锋枪子弹打出去，四、五个美国兵躺下了。那庆春猛觉左腿又麻又凉，摸了摸棉裤湿透了，血，疼，什么都不管它，还是咬着牙一梭子又一梭子枪弹打出去，连续打退敌人三次冲锋。十几个美国兵，都在那庆春的冲锋枪下，作了“长期占领朝鲜”的死鬼了。“轰隆”的一声炮响，震晕了失血过多的那庆春。等醒来的时候，他已经被抬在担架上。四起的凯歌声代替了枪炮声，他兴奋得竟忘了伤疼，和着歌声唱了起来：“我们是为和平正义而战争的战士，把残暴的敌人奸贼坚决驱逐！……”
