　　Ethnic Representatives Conferences Held in Lijiang, Yunnan and Other Places
    Strengthen National Unity and Consolidate Border Defense

    [Our Newspaper Dispatch] According to the Xinhua News Agency: The four special districts of Lijiang, Baoshan, Puer, and Zhaotong in Yunnan Province, where minority ethnic groups are mixed, and the counties under the jurisdiction of Baoshan and Lijiang special districts have successively convened people's representative conferences of various ethnic groups. Among them, the counties in Lijiang Special District have held one to five people's representative conferences of various ethnic groups. The people's representative conferences of various ethnic groups in each special district and county have played a significant role in strengthening national unity and consolidating the border defense of the motherland.
    The representatives attending the above-mentioned people's representative conferences of various ethnic groups in the special districts included 26 ethnic groups, such as Han, Minjia, Mosuo, Lisu, Tibetan, Hui, Bo, Shantou, Kawa, Aka, Lahu, Yi, and Miao, as well as representatives from all walks of life who believe in Lamaism, Islam, and Christianity, and more than 1,900 people, including Tusi, mountain officials, and headmen. At the meetings, people of all ethnic groups exposed and denounced the crimes of the Kuomintang bandits and imperialists in inciting ethnic relations and creating ethnic hatred in the past. Ma Deng, a Lisu representative from Gongshan County in Lijiang Special District, and Jifu, a Tibetan Tusi from Deqin County, reviewed the past disunity with other ethnic groups and expressed their willingness to cooperate amicably with people of other ethnic groups in the future. After the opening of the people's representative conference in Puer Special District, a grand bull-stabbing ceremony was held (stabbing the bull to death with a dart and sharing its meat to show unity), and they drank "cursed water" (expressing eternal vows) according to their customs, and erected a stone tablet at the ceremony site to commemorate it. After the Yingjiang County of Baoshan Special District convened the people's representative conference, 14 Bo youths voluntarily requested to study at the Baoshan Ethnic Cadre Training Class. Within ten days after the meeting, the people of all ethnic groups in Lianshan County of the district reported and assisted the people's government in capturing 17 hidden bandits and secret agents.
    The people's representative conferences of various ethnic groups in the special districts also discussed issues such as the construction of political power, production, trade, culture, education, and medical and health care in minority ethnic areas; and passed telegrams of tribute to Chairman Mao, the Korean People's Army, and the Chinese People's Volunteers.
