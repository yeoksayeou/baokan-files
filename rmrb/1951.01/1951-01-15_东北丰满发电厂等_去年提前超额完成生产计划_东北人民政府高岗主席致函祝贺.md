    东北人民政府高岗主席致函祝贺
    【新华社沈阳十三日电】东北工业部所属厂矿有二十八种主要产品于去年年底提前或超额完成了全年计划。丰满发电厂除于去年十二月六日提前完成全年发电计划外，到年底并超过全年任务百分之九点四，对充分供应东北区所需要的电力起了重大作用。辽阳市十九个公营厂矿均提前完成一九五零年的生产任务。
    为此，东北人民政府高岗主席于一月十日分别致函东北人民政府工业部全体职工、丰满发电厂全体职工及辽阳市十九个公营厂矿全体职工，祝贺他们在一九五零年生产建设上的胜利，并勉励他们为建设强大的国防力量，继续发挥爱国主义的精神，学好技术，爱护设备，进一步提高产品的质量，改善企业经营管理工作，争取在一九五一年的生产建设中创造更大的成绩。
