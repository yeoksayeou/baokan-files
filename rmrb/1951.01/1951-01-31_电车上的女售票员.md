　　Female Conductor on the Tram
　　Liu Yongling
　　Last year on "July 1st," our first group of female conductors officially started working on the trams. Most of us were female workers transferred from clothing factories. Having female conductors on the tram was a first in Beijing! At the time, many people disapproved. Some older male workers said, "Isn't this a joke? Young men in their twenties already get pushy, wouldn't the girls start crying if they got squeezed!" When we heard these words, we felt an extra surge of determination: We absolutely cannot lag behind our male comrades, we must overcome difficulties and answer them with facts.

　　In early August, most of the female conductors were assigned to Route 5 (from Xuanwumen to Chongwenmen). The stops on Route 5 were very short, and our skills were not yet proficient, so we encountered quite a few headaches at first. For example, from Xuanwumen to Xidan station was only four minutes. If the car was full of passengers and we had trouble with the tickets, we often couldn't finish selling them before arriving at the station. Then, more passengers would come on, and the conductors would get anxious, unable to distinguish who got on at Xuanwumen and who got on at Xidan. This often resulted in under-collection of fares, causing losses to business. During the merit evaluation in July and August, only one car on Route 5 received a fourth-class award.

　　We didn't get discouraged because of this. Every weekend, the women workers' group held a meeting where everyone could bring up problems and experiences for discussion and review, and work together to find solutions. We discussed the reasons for not getting the award, and everyone realized that the car wasn't running on time and the stops weren't evenly spaced. The reason for the slow pace was that the drivers were accommodating the conductors, afraid that they wouldn't finish selling the tickets before arriving at the station, so they didn't dare to drive fast. Also, the drivers had to help us take care of the passengers and close the back door before driving, which further delayed the time. Based on these reasons for the shortcomings, we studied ways to improve.

　　The women workers' group organized veteran workers to hold symposiums on introducing ticket-selling experience, and we also actively sought their help with any difficulties we had. In this way, our skills gradually improved. We could sell tickets from the back to the front without panicking. Even if we didn't finish selling them before arriving at the station, we wouldn't worry and would continue selling forward, remembering that those in front of us got on earlier and those behind us got on later, which prevented us from underselling tickets. In addition, we female conductors came up with a way to form a safety mutual aid group. Whenever it was Saturday, Sunday, or a day with a large gathering, the female conductors on the morning, noon, and evening shifts would come out to help close the back doors and take care of the passengers, allowing passengers to get on and off the bus quickly and not linger at the station. Passengers also avoided accidents because they didn't have to open the doors themselves. When the drivers saw that we weren't afraid of being tired, they all joined the mutual aid group. In this way, delays and accidents became extremely rare. As a result, during the merit evaluation in September and October, six of the eight cars on Route 5 received awards. The reason why the other two cars didn't get awards was not because their performance was bad, but because they had only been running for less than two months.

　　We were not complacent with such achievements. After the anti-American aggression and aid Korea denunciation meeting, our love for the motherland and hatred for the American bandits deepened. These loves and hates were concentratedly expressed in further improvements in production. In September and October, we did not yet have the confidence to drive safely for 10,000 kilometers, nor had we completely eliminated being off schedule. However, in the patriotic emulation, the comrades of Route 5 confidently put forward the fighting slogans: "1. Eliminating accidents is equivalent to annihilating the enemy; 2. Eliminating large delays is equivalent to consolidating national defense; 3. Not missing shifts or being late is equivalent to ensuring sufficient bullet supply; 4. Not being slow or having broken-down cars is equivalent to safely transporting the volunteers to the front." We also established a mutual aid group system, changing the past phenomenon of sometimes having many people, sometimes having few people, or sometimes having no one to help into a system with fixed rules. Now, the organization of the mutual aid group has been extended to all the routes.

　　After putting forward the action slogans, our female conductors had to better unite with the drivers and study technology more attentively. Every conductor remembered clearly how many minutes each station needed to travel. Every time we arrived at a mid-way station, if the driver didn't look at the watch, the conductor would take the initiative to check the time. If we were ahead of schedule, we wouldn't urge passengers to get on and off quickly. If we were behind schedule, we would urge passengers to get on and off quickly and tell the driver how fast or slow we were, so that he could control the time. Through such efforts, now, no matter how crowded it is on Sundays, we are never late or have accidents. In December, a total of thirteen cars on all routes completed 10,000 kilometers of safe driving, and Route 5 accounted for seven of them. Among the seven cars, two of them even completed 20,000 kilometers without accidents!

　　电车上的女售票员
    刘永龄
    去年“七一”，我们第一批女售票员正式上电车工作了。我们多半都是从被服厂转业过来的女工。电车上有女售票员，这在北京还是头一遭哩！当时，有好些人都看不惯。个别的老工友说：“这不是开玩笑吗？二十多岁的小伙子还挤得胡说哪，女孩子不得一挤就哭啦！”我们听了这些话，心里反倒蹩足了劲想：我们绝不能落后于男同志，我们一定要克服困难，拿事实来回答他们。
    八月初，大多数的女售票员都跑第五路车（从宣武门到崇文门）。五路的站头很短，我们的技术又还不熟练，起初可遇到不少伤脑筋的事。如从宣武门到西单这一站只有四分钟，要是上满了一车乘客，再碰上小票不方便的时候，往往卖不完就到站了。这时，后面又上来好些客人，售票员心里一着急，谁是宣武门上的，谁是西单上的全分不清了。这样，就往往少收了票款，使营业受到损失。七八月份评功的时候，我们五路只有一个车得到四等奖。
    我们并不因此泄气。每周末，女工组召集一次碰头会，大伙有什么问题和经验都提出来研究、检讨，一块儿想办法。我们把为什么没得奖的问题拿来讨论，大家检讨出是车走的点不正，当子不匀。车慢点的原因是司机照顾售票员，怕到站卖不完票，不敢快开，并且每站司机都要帮着我们照料乘客，关好后门才开车，所以更加耽误时间了。根据这些造成缺点的原因，我们研究了改进的办法。
    女工组为我们组织老工友开介绍卖票经验的座谈会，我们有什么困难也主动找他们帮助。这样，我们的技术逐渐提高了，能做到不慌不忙从后面一直往前卖，到站卖不完也不着急，还接着往前卖，记住身前就是先上车的，身后是刚上车的，这就不致少卖票款了。另外，我们女售票员又想办法成立安全互助小组。每逢星期六、星期日或有大集会的日子，早中晚三班的女售票员都分别出来帮助关后门，照料乘客，使乘客迅速上下车，不在站上多耽搁。乘客也因为不用自己去开车门，避免了事故。司机看我们都不怕累，他们也全都参加了互助组。这样，慢点和事故就极少了。结果，九、十月份评功，我们五路八个车就有六个车得了奖，没得奖的那两辆车并不是成绩坏，而是因为跑车的日期还不到两个月。
    我们有了这样的成绩，并不自满。经过抗美援朝的控诉大会以后，我们对祖国的热爱，对美国强盗的仇恨都更加深了。这些爱和恨集中地表现在生产的再提高上。九、十月间，我们对于安全行车一万公里还没有信心，也还没有做到完全消灭不正点。但在爱国主义竞赛当中，咱们五路车的同志，信心百倍地提出了战斗的行动口号：“一、消灭事故等于歼灭敌人；二、消灭大当等于巩固国防；三、不脱班，不迟到等于保证了子弹供应充足；四、不慢点、不坏车等于安全运送志愿军到前方。”我们又订出互助组的制度，把过去那种有时人多，有时人少或者没有人互助的现象改成有定规的互助。现在，互助组的组织已经推广到所有的车路了。
    提出行动口号以后，我们女售票员就得更好地团结司机，更用心地钻研技术。每个售票员把每一站需要走多少分钟都记得很清楚，每到中途站，要是司机不瞧表，售票员主动看时间，如果点快，就不紧催乘客上下，要是慢了点，就催客人快上快下，并把点的快慢告诉司机，让他好掌握时间。经过这样的努力，现在，无论碰上多拥挤的星期天，我们也不慢点，不出事故了。十二月份，所有车路共有十三个车完成安全行车一万公里，五路就占了七个车。七辆车当中还有两辆是完成二万公里无事故哩！
