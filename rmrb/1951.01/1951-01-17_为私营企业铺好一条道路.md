　　Paving a Road for Private Enterprises
　　Yu Huancheng
    The Provisional Regulations on Private Enterprises (hereinafter referred to as the "Regulations"), promulgated by the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government on New Year's Eve last year, is an extremely important piece of legislation. The government, with utmost seriousness, after numerous studies, discussions, and revisions, adopted the opinions of local industrial and commercial administrative authorities and industrial and commercial leaders. In just thirty-two short articles, it compiled and streamlined various provisions of the old Company Law and Civil Law, while injecting new blood, reducing verbiage but increasing meaning. The work was quite arduous. Its promulgation amid the anticipation of the national industrial and commercial sector will provide reassurance and protection to private enterprises.
    Recalling the early days of liberation, the atmosphere of welcoming the new and革旧 (discarding the old) was extraordinarily fervent. Private enterprises, having just undergone severe exploitation by the reactionary regime, coupled with hyperinflation and the cessation of false purchasing power, faced stagnant sales and numerous difficulties. To stabilize private enterprises and reduce disputes, the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council issued the "Instructions on the Issue of Limited Liability of Shareholders of Private Enterprises" in two articles on July 15th of last year, which quelled many unnecessary disputes among private enterprises. However, this was still an emergency measure, lacking a proactive role in encouraging investment and enterprise development. Therefore, the national industrial and commercial sector yearned for a legal framework to follow, enabling them to invest in enterprises with confidence and protection. These "Regulations" are suited to the current needs of industry and commerce.
    From these "Provisional Regulations," several important significances can be seen:
    First, based on and realizing the spirit of the Common Program, it is known that the government's policy is firm and unwavering. The first article of the first chapter of the Regulations explicitly declares this intention. To further illustrate, Article 3 of the Common Program states, "Protect the economic interests and private property of workers, peasants, the petty bourgeoisie, and the national bourgeoisie. Develop the New Democratic people's economy and steadily transform the agricultural country into an industrial country." Article 26 stipulates, "Various social and economic components, under the leadership of the state-owned economy, shall cooperate and perform their respective functions to promote the development of the entire social economy." These Regulations are largely tailored for the "private capitalist economy," allowing them to engage in enterprises with peace of mind, with all legitimate interests protected by law. The economic components represented by the petty bourgeoisie and the national bourgeoisie previously had the protection of the Common Program, but lacked specific laws to abide by, which inevitably led to some hesitation and concerns, preventing them from investing and developing enterprises with confidence. With these Regulations, all private enterprises, regardless of size, can act in accordance with the provisions. The "private capitalist economy" will thus find its proper place. These Regulations implement a portion of the Common Program related to economic policy.
    Second, the initial realization of planned economy. In the past, private enterprises were scattered, without guidance, and left to survive on their own. Seeing a small profit, they would rush headlong into a particular industry, leading to blind production and a disconnect between supply and demand. A good business would turn bad, becoming unmanageable, leading to ruin and expanding individual losses into social losses. Production based on sales, or sales allocated based on production, aims to prevent such losses and gradually move towards a planned economy (Article 6 of Chapter 1 of the Regulations). Public and private economies largely fall within the scope of planning. Furthermore, various private enterprises must first be approved and then registered (various articles on approval and registration in Chapter 2 of the Regulations). This was not provided for in the old laws (registration existed but was incomplete). In this way, blind production can be avoided, and all national enterprises can be accounted for. Planning can include private enterprises, and private enterprises can cooperate with planning. Striving for excellence step by step, the planned economy will develop day by day, and the people's economy will naturally develop day by day.
    Third, preferential treatment for investment and encouragement for enterprises. Articles 25 and 26 of the "Regulations," which stipulate dividends, were not included in the old laws but are specifically added. The distribution of profits to shareholders is also set at 60 percent, providing more favorable treatment to investors than in the past. Those with capital should use their capital with their mental and physical efforts to serve the economic development of society. Our country has enormous resources and enormous sales channels. In the past, under the economic aggression of imperialism, foreign goods flooded in, making it difficult for our industry and commerce to stand tall. Now that this economic aggression has been swept away, industrialists and businessmen, as long as they select suitable projects within the scope of the government's planned economy and conduct them properly, will certainly not fail. Under the New Democracy, "developing production and prospering the economy" is necessary. To achieve this goal, providing investors with reasonable profits is also necessary. These "Regulations" clearly express this.
    Fourth, clarifying the rights and responsibilities of enterprise organizations. Within domestic enterprises, there are quite a few non-investors or a small number of investors who, due to their positions, control the enterprise and encroach on the rights of investors. Article 19 of the "Regulations" clearly stipulates that enterprise leaders are subject to the command of investors. With capital comes rights, and with affairs comes responsibility. With clear rights and responsibilities, enterprises can be managed well. The Regulations also include provisions for the interests of labor (Article 7 of Chapter 1, Items 2 and 3 of Article 25 of Chapter 3). This was not included in the old laws and is a manifestation of the new era.
    Fifth, the spirit of the "Regulations" is absolutely different from the old Company Law. The old Company Law, focusing solely on companies, was extended to over 300 articles, with sole proprietorships and partnerships scattered within the Civil Law. Cumbersome and trivial, it existed entirely within the capitalist sphere. The New Democratic economy, while containing capitalist elements, is progressive, active, planned, and capable of unity and cooperation. "Joint operation" and "cooperative operation" (Article 5 of Chapter 1), new trends, are aimed at regulating supply and demand and avoiding unnecessary competition, absolutely different from the "cartels" and "trusts" in capitalist countries that aim solely to annex, monopolize, and dominate the market. Because of the leadership of state-owned economic enterprises, with "consideration for both public and private interests," private enterprises can "cooperate and perform their respective functions." "Profit-making" was originally the source of motivation for private enterprises. In the future, private interests will inevitably be combined with public interests, and individual business must be related to public tasks. Embark on the right path and gain both fame and fortune. Stray from the right path, and face ruin and disgrace. The thirty-two articles, though simple, have profound meaning. "Inferring the rest from one," understanding the spirit of these Regulations is the key to reading and using them well.
    Sixth, the promulgation of these Regulations coincides with the period of victory in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, and the beginning of the new year 1951, greatly encouraging the interest of industrialists and businessmen. Our past semi-feudal, colonial, and semi-colonial economy could not only fail to achieve socialism but also fail to develop capitalism. The development of capitalism must also be premised on the unification, independence, and peace of a country. Looking back at the history of capitalist countries, both old and new, they all went through a period of political struggle to achieve national unity, independence, and peace, and then capitalism was able to develop and be completed. Our anti-feudal struggle has unified the country through the power of the People's Liberation Army led by the Communist Party. The anti-imperialist struggle has won independence, but has not yet achieved consolidated peace. The War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea is a necessary stage in striving for peace through anti-imperialism. We have far-reaching goals, not to create and complete capitalism. However, the capitalist components affiliated with the New Democracy must also fully resist imperialism and achieve peace before they can develop. Imperialist military aggression and economic aggression come hand in hand, linked together. Economic aggression in peacetime can turn into military aggression at any time. In the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, the front-line military and the rear-area economy have different priorities, but are equally important. After the U.S. imperialists failed militarily in Korea, they used rogue actions such as trade blockades and the freezing of funds to strike at our economy. We should not be afraid, but rather rejoice. For over a hundred years, foreign goods have flooded in, oppressing our industry and commerce, even eliminating local handicrafts. Now that they are voluntarily withdrawing, they are giving us an opportunity to create a self-sufficient and economically independent economy. The emergence of many new industries in the interior during the full blockade of the War of Resistance Against Japan is clear evidence. Unfortunately, the reactionary government at the time did not protect them, and after the victory, they helped the U.S. imperialists sell American goods, battering the domestic emerging industries and crushing the sprouts. Fortunately, we were liberated. The U.S. imperialists' economic blockade will not only fail to defeat us but will give us the opportunity to develop. With the vastness of our country's land, the agricultural, forestry, fishing, and animal husbandry on the surface, and the metallic and non-metallic resources underground, are inexhaustible. The raw materials for industry and the commodities for commerce do not need to come from abroad; they are abundant within the country. We only need to use our brains and physical strength to work hard in science, engineering technology, management, and operation. In addition to the various important industries run by state-owned enterprises, private enterprises have a vast field for development. We have seen that during the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, industrial and commercial businesses in Beijing launched patriotic conventions, and industrial and commercial businesses in Tianjin launched demonstrations. Such activities are prevalent throughout the country, and cities and towns are active, demonstrating the patriotism and rapid progress of industrialists and businessmen. Use this enthusiasm and this perseverance to engage in production; what does not exist must be made to exist, and what already exists must be made excellent, to match or surpass imported goods, and to make it abundant enough to meet the needs of the people. This task largely falls on the shoulders of private industrial and commercial businesses. With these "Regulations," private enterprises do not have to worry about earning money and not being able to get it, nor do they have to face unlimited liability for losses. From now on, they can boldly invest and move forward courageously, creating new industries and supplying materials in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. Private interests combine into public interests, and business is a task, fulfilling the responsibility of defending the country on one's own post. The promulgation of these Regulations at this time is precisely to pave a magnificent road for private enterprises.
    Using these Regulations to welcome the New Year 1951, the improvement in the second half of this year will surely continue. The key to the business of industry and commerce lies in the countryside, where the raw materials come from and where the manufactured products are sold. The true saying "facing the countryside" has been widely recognized by industrialists and businessmen. This year, the government will undertake large-scale water conservancy projects and improve agricultural production. Floods in the Yellow and Huai Rivers can be prevented, and disaster areas last year may be free of disasters this year. Last year's harvest was abundant, and this year's harvest may be even more abundant. "Man will conquer nature." Agricultural production is gradually being mastered by science, unlike in the past when it was entirely "dependent on heaven." The Soviet Union, the new democratic countries of Eastern Europe, and the provinces of Northeast China are clear evidence. Last year, industrial and commercial businesses improved due to the abundant agricultural harvest. This year, it will be even better. "Congratulations and prosperity!" Happiness is the happiness of the individual spreading to the masses, and wealth is the wealth of the individual merging into the wealth of the masses. Use this common auspicious phrase to congratulate and bless the industrialists and businessmen of private enterprises.

　　为私营企业铺好一条道路
　　俞寰澄
    中央人民政府政务院于去年除夕颁布了私营企业暂行条例（下简称条例），是一个极重要的法例。政府极郑重地，经过好多次研究讨论修改，采纳了各地工商行政当局及工商业领袖们的意见，短短的三十二条，摭集并精简了旧公司法及民法各条文，而注入新血液，辞减意增，工作是相当艰难的。在全国工商业悬望之中颁布了，将使私营企业得到安慰与保障。
    回忆解放初期，迎新革旧，群情兴奋异常。私营企业，刚经过反动政权严重剥削又加以通货膨胀停止，虚伪购买力消灭之后，销路停滞，私营企业困难重重。为了安定私营企业减少纠纷起见，去年七月十五日，政务院财政经济委员会发布了“关于私营企业股东有限责任问题的指示”两条，使私营企业平息了许多无谓的争端。然而尚是应急办法，没有积极的鼓励投资发展企业的作用，所以全国工商业更望有一种法制，使他们投资企业，有所遵循，得到保护，这“条例”是适合于工商业现在的需要。
    从这“暂行条例”中见到几种重要意义：
    第一，根据并实现共同纲领的精神，从知政府的政策，确定不移。条例开宗明义第一章第一条，就宣示了这意旨，更为引证说明一下；共同纲领第三条，“保护工人，农民，小资产阶级，和民族资产阶级的经济利益，及其私有财产。发展新民主主义的人民经济，稳步地变农业国为工业国。”第二十六条，规定“各种社会经济成份在国营经济领导之下，分工合作，各得其所，以促进整个社会经济的发展。”这条例大体是为“私人资本主义经济”而定的。使他们得安心从事企业，一切合法利益受到法律的保障。小资产阶级，民族资产阶级所代表的经济成份，从前有共同纲领的保障，尚没有具体法律可资遵守，不免有点彷徨顾虑，未敢放手投资，发展企业。有了这条例，一切私营企业，不管大的小的，都可查照条文而行事。“私人资本主义经济”，从此得其所了。这条例是实践了共同纲领有关经济政策的一部分。
    第二，初步计划经济的实现。从前私营企业，散漫无稽，自生自灭。一见小利，便争先恐后，大家竞做这行业，盲目生产，供销脱节，好生意变坏了，弄得不可开交，倾家荡产，个体的损失，会扩大成为社会的损失。以销定产，或就产配销，就为防止这种损失，使逐步走上计划经济（条例第一章第六条），公私营经济，多在计划范围之内。又规定各种私营企业，必须先经核准，再请登记（条例第二章核准及登记各条）。此为旧法所未备，（有登记而不完备）这样就可以避免盲目生产，使全国企业，都可按册而稽。计划可以包括私营，私营可以配合计划。逐步求精，计划经济一步进一步，人民经济自然一天发展一天。
    第三，优待投资，奖励企业。“条例”第二十五、二十六条，规定股息，是旧法所未载，而特为添列的。股东分红利亦定了百分之六十，对于投资人较旧时更为优待。拥有资金的人，应以脑力体力运用其资力，为社会的经济发展而服务。我国有极大的资源，亦有极大的销路，从前在帝国主义经济侵略之下，洋货侵销，使我国工商业抬不起头，站不住脚。现在这种经济侵略扫除了，工商业家只要在政府计划经济的范围内，拣选适宜的事情正正当当的去做一定不会碰瘪。新民主主义下，“发展生产，繁荣经济”，是必要的。为达到此目的，给投资人以相当利润，亦是必要的。这“条例”就明白表示了。
    第四，分清企业组织的权责。国内各种企业，颇有非投资人或少数投资人，因为职位上的关系，把持了企业，侵夺投资人的权益。“条例”第十九条，明确规定了。企业负责人，是受投资人指挥的。有资即有权，有事即有责，权责分明，企业方搞得好。对于劳方利益，条例中亦有规定（第一章第七条“第三章第二十五条之二三两项）。这是旧法所未载，而是新时代的表现。
    第五，“条例”精神绝对与旧公司法两样。旧公司法，单是公司一项，迭增至三百余条，尚有独资合伙，散见在民法内，繁文琐碎，完全在资本主义圈内讨生活。新民主主义经济，固然含有资本主义成份在内，可是进步的，活动的，有计划的，能团结合作的。“联营”，“合营”，（条例第一章第五条）新的趋势，是为着调剂供销，避免无谓的竞争，绝对与资本主义国家的“卡特尔”“托辣斯”专为吞并垄断独占市场者不同。因为有国营经济事业的领导，“公私兼顾”，私营企业可以“分工合作，各得其所”。“营利”本来是私营企业发动的根源，今后私利必然与公利相结合，个人业务必须与公众任务相关联。走上正路，名利双收。不走正路，身败名裂。三十二条条文虽是简单，意味却是深长。“闻一知二”，认识这条例的精神，方为善读条例，善用条例。
    第六，这条例的颁布，正在抗美援朝胜利的时期，又值一九五一年新年开始，大大足以鼓舞工商业家的兴趣。我国已往半封建的、殖民地、半殖民地的经济，非但不能达到社会主义，而且不能发展资本主义。资本主义的发展，亦必以一国的统一，独立，和平为前提。我们一翻资本主义国家的历史，不管老的新的，都经过一段政治斗争历史，争取到国家的统一独立与和平，然后资本主义得能发展与完成。我们反封建，已由共产党领导的人民解放军的力量统一了全国。反帝，已争到了独立，而尚未获致巩固的和平。抗美援朝，正是从反帝来争取和平的必经阶段。我们有远大的目标，不是为创造与完成资本主义。然而新民主主义下附属的资本主义成份，亦必须完全反帝得到和平，而后始能发展。帝国主义的武力侵略，与经济侵略，双管齐下，相联而来。平时经济侵略，随时可变为武力侵略。在抗美援朝中，前方军事与后方经济，事有先后缓急，而重要则一。美帝在侵朝军事失败后，用封锁贸易冻结资金等无赖行动，来打击我们的经济。我们不要以为可怕，而反是可喜。百余年来洋货倾销，压逼我工商业，连地方手工制品，都被他们搞完。现在自动退出，正是给我们一个创造自给自足经济独立的机会。抗日战争遭到全面封锁时，内地发生了许多新兴工业，是一明证。可惜当时的反动政府，不加保护，胜利之后，反替美帝推销美货，把国内新兴工业打击得七零八落，一点萌芽，横加摧折。幸而解放了，美帝的经济封锁不但难不倒我们，反将给我们以发展的机会。以我国土地之大，地面上的农林渔牧，地底下的金属非金属，取之不尽，用之不竭。工业的原料，商业的商品，都不待外来，取诸国中而有余，只在我们用脑力体力，向科学工程技术管理经营各方面努力。国营企业所办各种重要工业之外，私营企业大有发展的园地。我们看到抗美援朝中，北京工商家发起了爱国公约，天津工商家发动了示威游行，各地遍行，城市乡镇都在活跃中，足见工商家爱国之殷，进步之猛。以此热心，以此毅力，来搞生产；没有的东西，要使他有，已有的东西，要使他精，抵得过或胜过舶来品，并且要使他多，足以供给民众的需要，这任务有很大部分落在私营企业工商家肩上。有了这“条例”，私营企业不愁赚了钱拿不到手，也不至赔了本责任无穷，从此可以放胆投资，勇往向前，于抗美援朝中，创造新工业，供给物资。私利合成公利，业务即是任务，在本身岗位上，尽了保家卫国的责任。在这时候颁布这条例，正是为私营企业铺好一条堂皇大道。
    用这条例欢迎一九五一年新年，今年下半季的好转，一定会连续下去。工商业的生意经，全在农村，原料出在那里，制成品销在那里，“面向农村”一句真言，已为工商家普遍认识了。今年，政府更大举修治水利，改进农作。黄淮水患可以防治，去年灾区，今年可能无灾了。去年丰收，今年可能更加丰收。“人定胜天”，农业生产，渐归科学掌握，不似已往完全“靠天吃饭”。苏联，东欧新民主国家，我国东北各省，明证显然。去年因农产丰收，而工商业好转，今年好上加好，是无疑义的。“恭喜发财”，喜是由个人的喜遍及大众，财亦是由个人的财合并成大众的财。人人恭喜，个个发财，以此年头通用吉语，为私营企业的工商家祝颂。
