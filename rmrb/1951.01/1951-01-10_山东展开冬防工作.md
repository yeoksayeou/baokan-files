Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 8th. Winter defense work in various parts of Shandong Province has gradually begun. This year's winter defense work in the province is being carried out in conjunction with the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, protect our homes and defend our country. Through current affairs propaganda and study, the people in various places have heightened their vigilance against the U.S. imperialists' aggressive plots and the sabotage activities of the remaining domestic enemies. Public security organs in cities such as Jinan and Xuzhou have held large and small resident meetings respectively to conduct winter defense education. Jinan City has also universally organized civil police self-defense teams. In rural areas, the focus is on reorganizing and strengthening militia organizations. In Laiyang Prefecture, in addition to strengthening the original militia organizations, more than 14,000 young farmers have been recruited to participate in the militia teams, increasing the winter defense force. Wendeng Prefecture, located on the coast, focuses on strengthening coastal defense and severely suppressing the sabotage activities of bandits and special agents.

In terms of fire prevention, all cities have inspected and strengthened the equipment and organization of fire brigades. Factories in Jinan City have been actively repairing and adding fire-fighting equipment. Public security police stations in urban areas have conducted inspections of flammable materials to strictly prevent fires.

　　山东展开冬防工作
    【新华社济南八日电】山东省各地的冬防工作已逐步展开。该省今年的冬防工作是结合抗美援朝保家卫国运动进行的。在时事宣传和学习中，各地人民提高了对于美帝国主义的侵略阴谋和国内残余敌人进行破坏的警惕性。济南、徐州等城市的公安机关，都分别举行了大小居民会议，进行冬防教育。济南市并普遍组织了民警自卫队。在农村，则着重整理和加强民兵组织。莱阳专区除加强原有的民兵组织外，并吸收了青年农民一万四千余人参加民兵队，增加了冬防力量。地处沿海的文登专区则着重加强海防，严厉镇压土匪特务的破坏活动。
    在防火方面，各城市都检查和加强了消防队的设备和组织。济南市各工厂均纷纷修理和添置消防器具。市区各公安派出所进行了易燃物的检查，严防发生火灾。
