　　Constantly Improve the Ideology of Communist Party Members
　　Sobolev, Head of the Propaganda Department of the Leningrad City Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)

　　The Marxist-Leninist knowledge of cadres and the ideological and political education of Communist Party members are one of the most important parts of party work. The Leningrad City Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), following the resolution of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) on Party propaganda, attaches great importance to this issue.

　　Approximately 170,000 Communist Party members in Leningrad are studying Marxist-Leninist theory in groups and political schools, or independently. The majority of Party members and probationary members are participating in studies. From the beginning of the studies, the district committees and grassroots organizations of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) have strictly supervised the content of the lessons, the study plans, and the individual study plans for the independent study of the fundamentals of Marxism-Leninism.

　　More than 6,000 propagandists (equivalent to study instructors in China) lead political schools and groups, most of whom have higher education and six to ten years of experience in propaganda and education work. The correct selection of propagandist cadres is an important condition for the success of Party education work.

　　The work of Comrade Slesarev, a propagandist, proves this point. In addition to receiving higher education, he also graduated from the University of Marxism-Leninism. In the group he leads, all listeners actively participate in the study. The questions raised by the propagandist are discussed by all members of the group. Some comrades actively express their opinions. At the end of the study, Comrade Slesarev always connects what has been studied with reality to make a profound summary, thus helping the studying Party members gain profound knowledge. The listeners in Comrade Slesarev's group are all advanced workers in production. For example, locksmith Comrade Alekseyev systematically completes 200% to 224% of his work quota. Another listener in the group, Comrade Malitsev, is an excellent producer and has now been promoted to technician. And mechanic Comrade Mushin has been promoted to dispatcher.

　　The City Committee, considering the decisive role of propagandist cadres in the Party education system, is able to provide leaders and consultants of groups and political schools with various forms of assistance on a regular basis. Approximately 4,000 people are studying in the regular training courses for propagandists attached to the Party offices of the district committees. The training courses study the content of the lessons and discuss in detail the issues of propaganda and education methods, and disseminate the successful experiences of propagandists.

　　Most districts also implement the method of mutual observation among propagandists, with the most experienced propagandists giving public demonstrations. After the observation, detailed discussions and analyses are conducted.

　　At the initiative of some Party district committees, many highly qualified propagandists, such as scholars, university teachers, and Party work leaders, answer questions for comrades who are doing propaganda for the first time, and attend their lectures to give timely and specific instructions and advice, in order to help young propagandists master the art of Bolshevik propaganda and education.

　　The City Committee insists on striving to ensure that propagandists closely link the study of teaching materials with the daily work of the enterprises where the groups are located. When preparing lessons, propagandists should not only comprehensively explain the content of the study, but also point out the main problems currently facing a particular enterprise.

　　Leningrad is a city with great revolutionary traditions, with the most valuable museums and historical sites. Many propagandists skillfully use these favorable conditions in their work: they organize Party members to visit the branch of the Lenin Museum, the Kirov Museum, and the house on Ilyich Street where the great Lenin lived during his struggle with the populists; they also visit the room where Lenin lived in Smolny. They also organized tours to historical sites in Petersburg related to Stalin's activities.

　　Many propagandists invite veteran workers – witnesses and participants of the 1905-1907 Revolution and the February Revolution and the Great October Socialist Revolution – to give speeches in political schools or groups.

　　In the groups of the Lenin Factory (formerly the Semyannikov Factory), when studying the first few chapters of the "Concise History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)," the propagandists reminded their listeners that it was in this place, in this factory, that Lenin had organized the first Marxist groups, which later united to form the Petersburg "League of Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working Class." They also introduced the Party members to the leaflets written by Lenin to the workers of the Semyannikov Factory.

　　The participants in the groups of the Stalin Factory listened with great interest to the recollections of veteran workers about the arrival of the revolutionary leader Lenin in Petrograd in April 1917, and the impressions caused by Lenin's speech on the armored car at the Finland Station.

　　Organizing studies in this way makes their work exceptionally lively, enhances the ideological content of propaganda and education, and increases the knowledge of the listeners.

　　This year, the work of comrades engaged in independent political study has also been regulated more thoroughly. The method of independent study of Marxism-Leninism has gained widespread popularity. This requires Party organizations to pay attention to consultants and strengthen lectures and propaganda.

　　Attached to the City Committee and district offices are circulating lectures on the history of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), political economics, dialectical and historical materialism, and the internal and external policies of the Soviet state. These lectures regularly have more than 15,000 Party member listeners. There are more than 7,000 consultants in Leningrad to help with the independent study of Marxism-Leninism.

　　We have all the conditions to successfully complete the plan for this academic year. But we must completely eliminate the shortcomings existing in the Party's propaganda and education organizations. We are still unable to ensure that all political schools and groups complete the study plan within the prescribed period. In individual Party grassroots organizations, lessons are still interrupted from time to time, and attendance is low. There is formalism and a schoolboy-like attitude in the study. When checking the independent study of Party members, it is found that some comrades who are independently studying the fundamentals of Marxism-Leninism have not studied well, and have not fulfilled the basic requirements for improving their political knowledge. In many Party organizations in the Kuibyshev District, more attention is not paid to Party members studying independently. In individual Party organizations in the Kalinin District, there is also no establishment of supervision over the implementation of Party members' individual plans.

　　Some district committees and grassroots Party organizations are satisfied with the initial results of the study, and therefore stop propaganda work, failing to see any shortcomings in the propaganda. The effect is also not great when eliminating shortcomings.

　　The City Committee instructed the Party district committees and grassroots organizations to take clear plans to supplement the previous wasted lessons in the remaining time of this academic year. Many districts in the city held meetings of Party activists, plenary sessions of the district committees, and meetings of secretaries of grassroots Party organizations. These meetings discussed the tasks of the Party organizations in completing the academic year in the Party education system.

　　The Party offices in the city, districts, and factories will conduct specialized methodological training courses to enable leaders and consultants of groups and political schools to learn how to summarize lessons.

　　The City Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), the Party district committees, and the grassroots Party organizations are taking all steps to improve the Marxist-Leninist study of Communist Party members, and are fully preparing to complete the plan for this academic year in an exemplary manner.

### 不断地提高共产党员的思想

　　不断地提高共产党员的思想
    联共（布）列宁格勒市委会宣传鼓动部部长索勃列夫
    干部的马列主义的知识及共产党员的思想政治教育——是党内工作最重要部分之一。联共（布）列宁格勒市委会，遵从着联共（布）中央委员会关于党的宣传决议，异常重视这个问题。
    列宁格勒城约有十七万共产党员在小组和政治学校中学习或独立地研究马列主义的理论。党员和候补党员中，大部分参加了学习。联共（布）的区委会和党的基层组织从学习开始时，对功课的内容，对学习计划及独立研究马列主义基础的个人学习计划，都给予了严格的监督。
    六千多名宣传员（相当于中国的学习指导员），领导着政治学校和小组，其中大多数人是具有高等教育，并有六年至十年的宣传教育工作经验。正确的选择宣传员干部，是党教育工作成功的重要条件。
    宣传员斯列萨列夫同志的工作即证明了这一点。他除受到高等教育以外，还毕业于马列主义大学。他所领导的小组内，全部听众都能积极地参加学习。宣传员提出的问题，由小组全体组员进行讨论。其中有一些同志积极地发表自己意见。当学习结束时，斯列萨列夫同志总是把所研究的东西与实际联系起来做出深刻的总结。这样帮助学习的党员获得了深刻的学识。斯列萨列夫同志小组中的听众都是生产的先进者。如锁匠阿列克赛耶夫同志，有步骤地完成着自己工作份额百分之二百至二百二十四。小组中另外一位听众马利采夫同志，是一位优秀的生产者，现在被提升了技师。而机械士穆新同志被提升为调配师。
    市委会考虑到宣传员干部在党教育系统中的决定性的作用，所以能够对小组与政治学校的领导人和顾问经常给予各种帮助。区委会党办公厅所附设的宣传员的经常讲习班中，约有四千人在学习。讲习班中一方面研究学习内容，同时还详细地讨论宣传教育方法问题，传播宣传员的成功的经验。
    多数区还实行宣传员互相观摩的方法。由最有经验的宣传员进行公开的示范。观摩后再进行详细的讨论和分析。
    由于一些党的区委会的发起，学者、高等学校教师和党的工作的领导人，这样许多具有高等资格的宣传员，给一些初次做宣传员的同志解答问题；并出席听这些宣传员讲课，及时给予具体的指示和劝告。以帮助年青的宣传员们掌握布尔塞维克宣传教育的艺术。
    党的市委会坚持力求使宣传员在研究教材时，一定要紧密地联系着小组所在的企业的日常工作。宣传员们在准备功课时，不仅要全面地阐明学习的内容，而且都要指出某企业当前的主要问题。
    列宁格勒是具有伟大革命传统的城市，有最有价值的博物馆和史迹，许多宣传员巧妙地利用这些优越的条件到自己工作中去：他们组织党员到列宁博物馆分院去游览，到基洛夫博物院，到伊里奇街伟大的列宁与民粹派斗争时期所住的房子中去；也到列宁在斯摩里住的房间去参观。他们还组织了旅行团到彼得堡与斯大林活动有关的史迹地点去游览。
    许多宣传员都邀请一些老年工人——一九○五至一九○七年革命和一九一七年二月革命及伟大的十月社会主义革命的目击者及参加人——到政治学校或小组中来演讲。
    在列宁工厂的小组中（列宁工厂原名塞棉尼可夫工厂），当研读“联共（布）党史简明教程”的前几章时，宣传员们使自己的听众们回忆起正是在这个地方，在这个工厂里，列宁曾组织了第一批马克思主义小组，这些小组后来团结为彼得堡“工人阶级解放斗争同盟”。他们还介绍党员们读了列宁所写的告塞棉尼可夫工厂工人们的传单。
    斯大林工厂中小组的参加者，异常有兴趣地倾听老年工人关于革命领袖列宁于一九一七年四月到彼得格勒的回忆，及列宁在芬兰车站铁甲车上的演说所引起的印象的回忆。
    小组这样来组织学习，使得它们的工作异常生动活泼，提高了宣传教育的思想内容，增进了听众的知识。
    今年，对于独立从事政治学习的同志们的工作，也规定得完善多了。独立研究马列主义的方法获得了广泛的普及。这要求党组织对顾问的重视及加强讲演宣传。
    在市委会与区的办公厅下附设有循环讲演，讲题有关于联共（布）历史、政治经济学、辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义问题及苏维埃国家内外政策问题。这些讲演经常有一万五千多名党员听众。帮助独立研究马列主义的顾问，在列宁格勒即有七千多名。
    我们具有一切条件可以成功地完成本学年的计划。但是必须完全铲除党的宣传教育组织中存在着的缺点。我们还不能使一切政治学校和小组在规定时期完成学习计划。在个别的党的基层组织中功课还时有间断，出席人数不多。在学习时有着形式主义和小学生似的态度。当检查党员的独立学习时，发现某些独立学习马列主义基础的同志，就没有很好地进行学习，没有完成提高自己政治知识的基本要求。在古北什夫区许多党组织中对独立学习的共产党员更不注意。加里宁区个别党组织中，也没有建立对党员个人计划执行的监督。
    某些区委会及党的基层组织，满足于学习的初步成果，故而停止宣传工作，看不到宣传中的任何缺点。在铲除缺点时，效果也不大。
    市委会指示党的区委会与基层组织，必须采取明确的方案，使在本学年余下的时间内补充以前的荒废的课业。市内许多区都举行了党的积极分子的会议，区委会全会，党的基层组织书记会议。在这些会议上讨论了在党教育系统中完成学年时党组织的任务。
    市、区和工厂中党的办公厅，将要进行专门的方法讲习班，使小组和政治学校的领导人和顾问，学习怎样作功课的总结。
    联共（布）市委、党的区委会和党的基层组织正采取着一切步骤来改善共产党员的马列主义学习，全面地准备着示范地完成本学年计划。
