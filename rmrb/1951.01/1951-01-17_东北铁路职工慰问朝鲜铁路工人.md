Xinhua News Agency, 16th: Northeast railway workers warmly extend condolences to Korean railway workers who are bravely fighting in difficult circumstances. Since Anshan Railway labor model representatives Cai Zhizhong, Gao Xujin, Wang Jingbin, and Li Shuyou proposed on December 9th of last year to initiate a campaign among all Northeast railway workers to donate one work point per person (one work point is equivalent to approximately 2.9 catties of sorghum) to assist Korean railway workers, over 200,000 Northeast railway workers have enthusiastically responded. As of January 5th of this year, the total number of donations reached 280,000 work points, used to purchase 950 cotton-padded clothing sets, 385 pigs, and 287 packages of chickens (25 chickens per package). All workers also wrote a letter of condolence in both Chinese and Korean, and presented a silk banner to the Korean railway workers, which read: "Let us unite closely to oppose our common enemy—the American aggressors; and fight for lasting world peace!" In addition, there were a large number of condolence letters, illustrated magazines, and other items.

The aforementioned condolence items have recently been taken to Korea by the Northeast Railway Workers' Condolence Delegation.

　　东北铁路职工慰问朝鲜铁路工人
    【新华社十六日讯】东北铁路职工热烈慰问在艰苦环境英勇斗争的朝鲜铁路工人。自安东铁路劳动模范代表才致中、高绪进、王静彬、李树有等于去年十二月九日建议发起全东北铁路职工每人捐献一工分（一工分约合二·九斤高粱米）援助朝鲜铁路工人后，东北铁路二十余万职工热烈响应，至今年一月五日止，捐献的总数共达二十八万工分，购买棉衣九百五十套，猪三百八十五口，鸡二百八十七包（每包二十五只）。全体职工还写了一封中朝文字的慰问信，并赠送朝鲜铁路职工锦旗一面，上边写着：“让我们紧紧团结起来，反对我们的共同敌人——美国侵略者；为争取世界持久和平而斗争！”此外还有大批慰问信、画刊等。
    上述慰劳品已于日前由东北铁路职工慰问团携赴朝鲜。
