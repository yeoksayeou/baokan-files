Xinhua News Agency, January 18th:

　　To maintain the ongoing nature of patriotic production campaigns, the nationally renowned Ma Hengchang Advanced Production Group of the Northeast Fifth Machine Factory has proposed five conditions to challenge workers in factories and mines across the country. The five conditions are: First, unite with technical personnel, strengthen technical learning, improve operating methods, achieve a quality standard of 99% or higher, and complete tasks ahead of schedule. Second, masters guarantee to raise all apprentices to 60% of the general technical level; apprentices guarantee to care for machines, organize tools, and not affect the master's timely operation. Third, abide by labor discipline, adhere to work posts, and ensure that the attendance rate does not decrease before and after the Spring Festival. Fourth, strengthen the "four preventions" work (prevent fire, prevent accidents, prevent theft, prevent sabotage), ensure the safety of all group machines and personnel, and cherish public property, overcoming waste. Fifth, strengthen current affairs learning, improve political awareness, and do a good job in propaganda and mobilization.

　　After the challenge conditions and news of the Ma Hengchang Group were published in the Beijing Worker's Daily yesterday, workers in the capital immediately responded enthusiastically. The Liu Dezhen Group of the Shijingshan Power Plant, the Water Meter Section Group of the Beijing Waterworks Company, the 8th and 9th Groups of the First Sewing Department of the Beijing Garment Factory, the Nie Yinchang Group of the Second Telephone Bureau of the Beijing Telecommunications Bureau, and the Record Desk Group of the Long-Distance Department of the Beijing Telecommunications Bureau, and other units, have all submitted letters of response and proposed specific counter-challenge conditions. The Beijing Federation of Trade Unions has written a letter calling on all levels of trade unions and all employees to actively respond to the challenge. The letter stated: "The challenge of the Ma Hengchang Advanced Production Group provides us with a good opportunity to learn from advanced producers." The letter called on all employees of factories, mines, and enterprises to propose clear and specific challenge conditions based on the production requirements of their units, workshops, and groups; all advanced production models should better unite the masses and take the lead in responding to this challenge; comrades in trade union work at all levels should more deeply lead and promote the advancement of the competition movement.

　　While publishing the challenge news of the Ma Hengchang Group, the Worker's Daily also published a short commentary introducing the advanced experience of the Ma Hengchang Group, calling on all trade union groups across the country to combine the competition conditions proposed by the Ma Hengchang Group with their own specific circumstances for discussion, to learn from and respond to the challenge of the Ma Hengchang Group.

　　Note: In 1950, the Ma Hengchang Group improved 15 kinds of tools, created 25 new records, improved quality to 99% of the standard, and completed the production task ahead of schedule.
