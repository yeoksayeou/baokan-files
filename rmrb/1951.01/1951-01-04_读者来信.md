Reader's Letters

     A Voice of an Awakened Mother
     Reader Li Ta's Self-Account of the Transformation of Her Understanding of American Imperialism and Pledge

Comrade Editor:

    I am in great pain, and I cannot control the anger in my heart. I have many things to say, and I want to speak to every mother in the world who has not yet clearly understood American imperialism.

    I am an ordinary woman. When the American war of aggression against Korea began, I found it very strange. Because I have always had a kind of fantasy about the United States, and I have always admired their "civilization." I often felt that the articles in the newspapers about the history of American imperialist aggression against China were too exaggerated. I always thought: Americans are very civilized and reasonable; they would not do such bloody things. I always thought that those who participated in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement were too emotional, and I always stood in the position of a third party to observe, because the flames of this war had not yet burned me; or I was sleeping and had not yet noticed it.

    Today, I woke up, I was awakened by bloody facts! I saw how the civilized America that I had always admired was committing barbaric and ugly atrocities in Korea, which had just been liberated for more than five years and was building a beautiful life.

    I watched a documentary filmed on the front lines in Korea. When I watched this film, my tears could not stop. I hate myself for being too confused and selfish. When our friendly country and neighbor suffered such a terrible ravage, I was still sitting idly by, still observing, still doubting!

    From this film, I saw hospitals burning in the fire and schools bombed into ruins. I saw a mother bombed to death on the ground, while her child was lucky to be alive, eating milk from the corpse of the mother who had died and was covered with flies, sucking as if she could get a little milk. Poor child, he didn't know that his mother had already been killed by the Americans! What a heartbreaking sight!

    I saw a group of orphans who had lost their parents. When these poor children heard the sound of airplanes again, they were so frightened that they hid everywhere. This is the air force of the civilized country that I have always admired. They used machine guns to strafe this group of orphans who had lost their parents as military targets. The children fell down one by one, their heads bleeding and their bodies on fire. Dear mothers: tell me, what crime did these poor children commit? What bad things did they do? What reason do they have to die under the machine guns of American airplanes?

    I also have a baby boy who is just one year old. My child is very fat and beautiful, and everyone likes him when they see him. I often rejoice that my child was born in the People's Republic of China, born in the era of Mao Zedong. It is conceivable that if he is not ravaged by war, he will develop his future healthily and bravely, as his parents idealize. My child, I love him as much as I love my eyes; I cannot allow anyone to harm him. If anyone dares to harm him, I will fight him to the death. I think every mother in the world loves her child in the same way, and will not allow anyone to bully them. But, in Korea, how many children who were loved by their mothers were strafed to death by American airplanes and bombed to death by American bombs. Can every mother still sit idly by? Can every mother still think that resisting America and aiding Korea is excessive?

    Dear mothers, I was wrong in the past. I hope everyone will not make the same mistake as I did in the past. This is a bloody fact. If you have seen these facts with your own eyes, you will hate yourself for waking up too late, and hate being deceived by the American devils in the past, just like me. If you have seen the tragic deaths of Korean children with your own eyes, you will cry uncontrollably. Which parents don't have children? Which parents don't love their children? Let us love Korean children as much as we love the lives of our own children! We, peace-loving mothers, cannot let our children die under American machine guns. We must avenge the victims!

    We must interrogate these murderers, these executioners who are several times more vicious than the Japanese bandits. We will never allow these hypocrites from "civilized" countries, these habitual murderers, to come to China again. Our children must not see this group of monsters, and our land must not be ruined by them. In order to protect our children, dear mothers, we must stand up bravely! We must demand blood debts from the executioners! I firmly declare: I am willing to dedicate myself to the motherland. If the motherland needs me, I will go without hesitation to the place where I am needed, to fight for the children, and to fight for lasting peace.

    Measures to Protect Public Grain and Prevent Sabotage

Comrade Editor:

    Under the leadership of the government, the people of the Fifth District of Ba County, Eastern Sichuan, are organizing to protect the granary. At present, special agents, bandits, and despots are trying to sabotage public grain by various means. Therefore, the district office convened a meeting of the custodians of each bao, and we unanimously realized that public grain is the blood and sweat of the people, and also the wealth of our country and the masses of the people. We must resolutely protect it. Therefore, our district and township have organized custody committees, and each bao has established a granary protection team. We also studied measures to protect public grain and prevent sabotage:

    (1) Use a windmill to blow away insects and moths, ash, and moisture; put a layer of dry hemp willow leaves in the warehouse, and then a layer of grain; seal the cracks in the warehouse with cow dung, and then paste them with paper. (2) Put bags of lime into the grain to absorb moisture; use bamboo to weave an air cylinder and place it in the center of the warehouse to circulate air; use cats to prevent rats; sweep the firewood and grass around the granary to prevent fire. (3) The granary protection team inspects the warehouse every three days and reports every five days. (4) Strengthen surveillance to prevent sabotage by special agents, bandits, and despots, and unite to eliminate bandits, suppress local despots, and eliminate hidden traitors to eradicate the root of evil.

    Leading Cadres Are Not Familiar with Business Regulations
    Waste in the Overhaul Work of Jilin Locomotive Depot

Comrade Editor:

    Ma Wanling, the director of the Jilin Locomotive Depot under the Jilin Railway Bureau, does not conduct investigations and research on his work, and is not familiar with railway work regulations. He issues orders subjectively, resulting in waste of labor and materials in the locomotive overhaul work, causing unnecessary losses to the country. The story is as follows:

    When the Class A inspection team of Jilin Locomotive Depot was overhauling locomotive No. MK1662, the workers found that there were six pieces of axle box flat iron needed for repairing the axle were lacking. If new products were used, it would affect the locomotive's ability to leave the factory on time. At that time, the Class A inspection supervisor and the foreman jointly researched, and according to past experience, they believed that old products that did not exceed the limit could be used with shims. As a result, six pieces of old axle box flat iron that did not exceed the limit were used with shims, including two pieces with a one-millimeter shim and four pieces with a half-millimeter shim. After the locomotive axle was completely repaired, the locomotive inspector Wang Weihan pointed out that the axle box flat iron with shims did not comply with the regulations and must be reworked and repaired. He submitted this matter to the director for research. Director Ma Wanling did not carefully consider and deeply understand the situation, nor did he check the overhaul regulations, and ordered rework. The workers were all indignant during the rework and felt ashamed, thinking that the work task could not be completed well, so how could it be considered resisting America, aiding Korea, and defending the country? Everyone hurried to repair it, and eight people worked in two shifts for twenty-four hours, completing all the disassembly, repair, and assembly. However, during the work, everyone kept raising questions, thinking that in the past, using old axle box flat iron with shims could guarantee the operation of the vehicles, so why is it not allowed now? The workers reflected this opinion to the depot trade union. After understanding the situation, the chairman of the depot trade union found the director to research and requested the director to find the "Regulations for Large, Medium, and Class A Overhaul" stipulated by the Ministry of Railways to check. As a result, it was found that the regulations clearly stipulated that no more than two shims were allowed for the axle box flat iron during the Class A overhaul of locomotives. This is how the cause of the error was traced. Director Ma Wanling and inspector Wang Weihan immediately admitted their mistakes to the workers and examined their shortcomings of bureaucracy and unfamiliarity with regulations.

    However, this matter has caused a loss of nearly 100 million yuan (Northeast currency, the same below) to the people's railway. First of all, it extended the repair time of locomotive No. MK1662 by twenty-four hours, and it also affected another locomotive No. PX6629, which was twenty-four hours late to be installed on the Class A inspection platform, which means that two locomotives could not be used for forty-eight hours. According to the regulations, each locomotive stays for one hour, calculated at 2 million Northeast currency, that is, a loss of 96 million yuan.

    Secondly, the waste of materials is also very large. According to the Class A inspection supervisor, because the leaders at the depot level were not familiar with the regulations in the past, they believed that the axle box flat iron could not be used with shims, so about 200 pieces of axle box flat iron that could be used with shims were discarded in the depot (the letter writer did not indicate whether these things can still be used now - Editor), calculated at the price of 270,000 yuan per piece according to the bureau's regulations, totaling about 54 million yuan.

    Construction Material Company of Jinzhou Engineering Company
    Should Not Abuse Power to Collect Taxes Without Authorization

Comrade Editor:

    The Jinzhou Municipal Taxation Bureau has learned about the account books of certain state-owned enterprises and found that there is a phenomenon of abuse of power to collect taxes without authorization. For example, the Construction Material Company of Jinzhou Engineering Company collected more than 2.5 million yuan in taxes without authorization; Lihua Engineering Company bought a Yue Xirong No. 2 boiler and deducted 2.5 million yuan in taxes by itself. In addition, the Public Construction Engineering Company bought materials and deducted a certain amount of taxes without authorization, and they couldn't even figure out the number themselves. These are all acts that violate the state's tax policy. The tax should undoubtedly be handed over to the tax bureau so that formal tax invoices can be issued. We hope that the Central Ministry of Finance and the State Taxation Administration should pay attention to and deal with this matter.

                                         Communication Team of Jinzhou Municipal Taxation Bureau

    Yutian County Government Did Not Implement Policies Well, Inconsistent in Words and Deeds in Some Issues

Comrade Editor:

    Now I feel that the Yutian County government is increasingly separated from the masses in some places, mainly because it has not implemented policies well and is inconsistent in words and deeds. I think this is an extremely important issue, and people's governments at all levels must change this work style in the future; otherwise, it will greatly affect the government's prestige among the people.

    In the past year, the problem of inconsistency between words and deeds has occurred a lot in the county government, and the masses have reflected a lot. For example, this spring, the county government decided to buy wood from the masses, 40 jin of rice per root (prescribing length and thickness standards), and 12 jin of rice for 100 jin of tree branches. However, when the masses of Zhu Liao Zhuang cut down the trees and sent them to the designated location, the county government reduced the price of the wood by 8 jin of rice per root, changing it to 32 jin. The tree branches were also given 4 jin less, which made the masses say: "The people's government is actually taking advantage of the masses!"

    Another example is the issue of the use of rice coupons. On October 4, the county government issued a notice: from now on, the use of rice coupons for sending meals in rural areas will be abolished. The district also sent notices to each village for the same reason, to prevent future confusion. But in December, the higher authorities issued another batch of rice coupons. When I went to Jiefang Village, the village branch secretary Comrade Li Qingyu asked: "Why are rice coupons being used again!"

    Take this autumn grain collection as an example. It was originally stipulated that millet should not be collected, but white corn and other grains should be collected. Because the collection in previous years required millet, some people had already milled the millet, preparing to hand over the grain; after hearing that the government would not collect it, they had to sell the millet and buy other grains or exchange it for money. But later, the government said that it wanted millet and not white corn. Some people had already sold the millet and bought white corn, so they had to sell the white corn again. The masses suffered a great loss and were very dissatisfied.

    Because our policies cannot be well implemented among the masses, it not only affects the political prestige of the Party and the people's government, but also gives some bad elements an excuse to spread rumors, and also affects the people's production enthusiasm. The reaction of the masses is a powerful criticism. Therefore, I suggest that the Yutian County People's Government must humbly listen to the opinions of the masses and change this work style.

                                                     Yu Ziqiang

     一个觉悟了的母亲的声音
     读者黎它自述对美帝认识的转变和誓言编辑同志：
    我心里很痛苦，我怎么也控制不住我心中的愤怒。我有许多话要讲，我要向全世界每一位对美帝国主义还没认识清楚的母亲讲。
    我是一个普通的妇女。当美国侵朝战争开始时，我觉得这是一件很奇怪的事。因为我对美国一直存在着一种幻想，对他们的“文明”，一向是崇拜的。我常感到报纸上关于美帝侵华史等文章好像是宣传的太过火了。我总认为：美国人是很文明的，也很讲公道的；他们不会做出那种血淋淋的事情。我对于参加抗美援朝运动的人，总认为是感情太冲动，自己始终站在第三者立场来观察着，因为这个战争的火焰，还没烧痛我；或是我在睡觉，还没发觉它。
    今天，我惊醒了，我被血淋淋的事实惊醒了！我看到了被我一向崇拜着的文明的美国是怎样在刚刚解放了五年多而建设起美好生活的朝鲜作着野蛮而丑恶的兽行。
    我看了一部在朝鲜前线实地拍摄的记录片。当我看这部片子时，我的眼泪怎么也止不住了。我恨我自己太糊涂、太自私，当我们的友邦和邻国遭到了这样惨的蹂躏，我还在坐视，还在观察，还在怀疑！
    从这部片子里，我看见了医院在大火中燃烧着，学校炸成了废墟。我看见了一位母亲被炸死在地上，而孩子却侥幸地活着，在那已死去了的飞着蝇子的母亲尸上吃着奶，好像能吃出一点奶水似的吮吸着。可怜的孩子，他那里知道妈妈早已被美国人杀死了！这是多么叫人痛心的惨状！
    我看见了一群失去了父母的孤儿，这群可怜的孩子，当他们再听到飞机的声音时，吓的到处躲。这就是我一向崇拜的文明国家的空军，他们把这群失去了父母的孤儿作为军事目标，用机枪扫射。孩子们一个个倒下去，脑袋流出血，身上着了火。亲爱的母亲们：你们说，这群可怜的孩子，他们有什么罪？他们做了什么坏事？他们有什么理由要死在美国飞机的机枪下？
    我也有一个刚满一周岁的男孩子。我的孩子很胖，也很漂亮，人人见了都喜欢他。我常常庆幸我的孩子生在中华人民共和国，生在毛泽东时代。可以想像，如果他不受到战争的摧残，他会像父母们理想的那样，健康地、勇敢地发展他的未来。我的孩子，我爱他如同爱我的眼睛；我不能允许任何人来危害他。如果有人敢于危害他，我就与他拚个死活。我想，世界上每个母亲都是一样地爱护着他的孩子，同样地不会允许一个人来欺侮他们。但是，就是在朝鲜，多少被他们母亲所心爱的孩子，被美国飞机扫射死了，被美国炸弹炸死了。每一个做母亲的，还能坐视不理吗？每一个做母亲的，对于抗美援朝还能认为是过火吗？
    亲爱的母亲们，我过去是错了。希望大家不要像我过去似的再错下去。这是血的事实。如果你亲眼看见了这些事实，你会像我一样的痛恨自己觉悟得太迟了，痛恨过去受了美国鬼子的欺骗。如果你亲眼见到了朝鲜孩子们惨死的情形，你会哭不成声的。那个父母没有子女？那个父母不疼自己的孩子？让我们爱朝鲜的孩子也像爱自己孩子的生命一样吧！我们，爱好和平的母亲们，我们不能让孩子们死在美国的机枪下面。我们要为被迫害者报仇！
    我们要审问这些杀人的凶手，这些比日本强盗还要凶上几倍的刽子手。我们再也不允许这些“文明”国家的伪善者、惯于杀人的刽子手们到中国来。我们的孩子决不能看见这群怪兽，我们的土地决不能让他们糟蹋。为了保护我们的孩子，亲爱的母亲们，只有挺身而出，勇敢地站起来！我们要向刽子手们讨回血债！我坚决表示：我愿意献身祖国。如果祖国需要我，我就毫无顾虑地到需要我的地方，为了孩子而战，为永久的和平而战。

    巴县五区人民
    保护公粮防止破坏的办法编辑同志：
    川东巴县五区在政府领导下，人民正组织起来，保护粮仓。目前特务、土匪、恶霸正想用各种手段破坏公粮。所以区公所召集各保保管委员开过了会，我们一致认识公粮是人民的血汗，也是我们国家和人民大众的财富，我们必须坚决的保护它。所以我们区乡都组织起了保管委员会，每保设立护仓小组。我们并研究保护公粮防止破坏的办法：
    （一）用风车扬去虫蛾和灰渣，又能去湿气；仓内垫一层干麻柳叶，放一层谷子；仓的眼缝洞子用牛屎敷上，再用纸贴上。（二）用口袋装石灰放入谷内，吸去湿气；用竹子编成气筒放在仓中央以通空气；用猫儿防鼠；粮仓周围的柴草打扫干净以防火灾。（三）护仓小组每三天查仓库一次，五天汇报一次。（四）加强监视防止特务、土匪、恶霸的破坏，还要一致起来清匪反霸肃特，消灭祸根。

    领导干部不熟悉业务规章
    吉林机务段检修工作有浪费编辑同志：
    吉林铁路局所属吉林机务段段长马万龄，对工作不调查研究，不熟悉铁路工作规章，凭主观下命令，致在机车检修工作中，浪费人工、物料，对国家造成不应有的损失。事情的经过是这样的：
    吉林机务段甲检组，在甲检ㄇㄎ一六六二号机车时，工友们发现缺乏修大轴所需用的大轴箱平铁六块，如用新品，就会影响机车不能按时出厂。当时甲检监工员与工长等共同研究，根据过去的经验，认为用不超过限度的旧品可以加垫使用。结果加垫使了六块不超过限度的旧大轴箱平铁，其中加一公厘垫的两块，加半公厘垫的四块。把机车大轴全修好后，机车验收员王维翰提出：轴箱平铁加垫不合乎规章，必需反工重修。并将此事提交段长研究。段长马万龄未仔细考虑和深入了解情况，也不查看检修规程，即下令反工。工友们在反工中都纷纷不平，并感到惭愧，认为工作任务不能很好完成，怎能算做抗美援朝保家卫国呢？大家就赶紧重修，八个人分成两班，作了二十四小时，拆、修、装全部作完。但是，在工作中，大家不断发生疑问，认为过去使旧轴箱平铁加垫，都可以保证车辆的运行，怎么现在不成了呢。工友们就把这意见反映到段工会，段工会主席了解了这些情况后，即找段长研究，并请求段长找出铁道部规定的“大、中、甲检修规程”来查对，结果查出规程中曾明确规定，机车甲检时大轴箱平铁不超过两个垫是可以的。这样才追查出错误的原因，段长马万龄，验收员王维翰即向工友承认错误，检讨了自己的官僚主义与不熟悉规章的缺点。
    但是，这事已给人民铁路造成了将近亿元的损失（东北币，下同）。首先是延长了ㄇㄎ一六六二号机车的二十四小时修车时间，并且影响了另外一台ㄆㄒ六六二九号机车晚了二十四小时上甲检台装轮，也就是使两台机车四十八小时不能运用，如果按规定每台机车停留一小时以东北币二百万元计算，即损失了九千六百万元。
    其次对材料的浪费也很大，据甲检监工员说，因为段一级的领导过去对规章不熟习，认为大轴箱平铁不能加垫使用，因而把加垫能使用的大轴箱平铁丢弃段内不用的就有二百块左右（这些东西现在是否还可以利用，来信者未说明——编者），每块按局规定价格二十七万元计算，合计约值五千四百万元。

    锦州工程公司建筑材料行
    不该滥用职权擅自收税编者同志：
    锦州市税务局，曾对某些公营企业的账簿进行了解，发现有滥用职权擅自收税的现象。如锦州工程公司建筑材料行，擅自收税二百五十多万；利华工程公司买岳锡荣二号锅炉一个，自行扣下税款二百五十万元。另外公建工程公司买材料擅自扣取税款若干，连数目自己都摸不清。这都是违犯国家税收政策的行为。税款毫无疑问地应当交到税局，以便开给正式税票。对这件事我们希望中央财政部税务总局应该予以一定的重视和处理。

    玉田县府没有很好执行政策在有一些问题上言行不一致编辑同志：
    现在我感觉玉田县政府有的地方是日益脱离群众了，主要是因为没有好好执行政策和言行不一致。我认为这是一个极其重要的问题，各级人民政府今后必须改变这种工作作风；否则将大大影响政府在人民中的威信。
    一年以来，言行不一的问题在县政府发生了好多，群众反映也很多。如今春县政府决定收买群众的木材，四十斤米一根（规定了长短尺寸和粗细标准），十二斤米买一百斤树枝子。但朱廖庄的群众把树砍了，送到指定地点，县政府却把木材价格每根缩减小米八斤，改为三十二斤。树枝子也少给四斤，惹的群众纷纷说：“人民政府竟占群众便宜！”
    再如米票的行使问题，十月四日，县政府曾有通知：今后取消用米票在乡村派饭。区上也同样给各村去了通知，以防今后混乱。但十二月份，上级又发下一部米票。我到解放村去，村支部书记李庆于同志便问：“为什么又使用米票了！”
    拿这次秋征说，原规定不收小米，要白玉米和其它粮。因往年征收都是要小米，所以有的群众早就把谷子碾了米，准备交粮；听说政府不收，只好把小米卖了，买其它粮或变款。但以后，政府又说要小米，不要白玉米了。有的群众已把小米卖了，买了白玉米，只好把白玉米再卖掉。群众吃了很大的亏，很不满意。
    正因为我们的政策不能很好的在群众中执行，就不但影响了党和人民政府的政治威信，而且也给了某些坏分子造谣的借口，同时也影响了人民的生产情绪。群众的反映，正是一个有力的批评。因此，我建议玉田县人民政府必须虚心听取群众的反映，改变这种工作作风。
