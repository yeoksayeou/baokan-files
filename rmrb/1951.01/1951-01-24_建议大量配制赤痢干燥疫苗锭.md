　　Suggest Mass Production of Dried Dysentery Vaccine Tablets
    Dysentery has been most prevalent in various counties of the Yuci Special District for years, and the mortality rate is also the highest. Prevention should be emphasized. However, in rural areas, there is a severe lack of equipment and personnel for vaccine inoculation injections. Therefore, it is hoped that the government will mass produce dried dysentery vaccine tablets in the 1951 vaccine production, so that they can be taken orally to play a preventive role, effectively protecting rural productivity. We believe this method can be widely applied in rural areas, and we hope relevant authorities will consider implementing it.

　　建议大量配制赤痢干燥疫苗锭
    榆次专区各县历年来以赤痢流行最甚，死亡率也最大，对此应注意预防。而在农村中，对防疫苗接种注射，器械和人员均甚缺乏。所以，希望政府在一九五一年的疫苗生产中，能大量配制赤痢干燥疫苗锭，以便内服后起到预防作用。有效的保护农村生产力。我们想这办法可以在农村普遍应用，望有关机关考虑实行。
