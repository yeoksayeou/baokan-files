　　Organizing the Smooth Flow of Native Products is a Central Link in Financial and Economic Work
    Organizing the smooth flow of native products is currently the central link in revitalizing the national economy. This is one of the most important experiences in financial and economic work over the past year.
    Since the summer of last year, especially after the autumn harvest, state-owned trading companies have purchased a large quantity of native products. From January to November of last year, various specialized companies directly purchased and entrusted cooperatives to purchase agricultural products in various parts of Guannei, including more than 2 billion jin of grain, about 5 million dan of cotton, 9 million jin of bristles, 900 million eggs, and a large amount of down, fur, grease, tea, silkworm cocoons, tobacco, walnuts, etc. Except for a few items such as bristles and tea, the vast majority were purchased after June.
    The smooth sale of native products has first of all greatly improved the living standards and purchasing power of farmers, which is especially obvious in areas where land reform has been completed. Taking the cotton-producing areas of Hebei as an example, cotton farmers have universally and extensively purchased agricultural tools and fertilizers, built houses, made new clothes, and consumed a large number of other various daily-use industrial products. Thermos bottles with bamboo shells, as well as combs, mirrors, towels, socks, and the like, have been sold in large quantities in cotton-producing rural areas. According to a survey of Weixi Village, Cheng'an County, a cotton-producing area in Hebei Province, the village has a total of 400 households with more than 1,700 people. After the autumn harvest, they bought 110 new bicycles, an average of one bicycle for every four households, and more than 800 flashlights, an average of one flashlight for every two people.
    The expansion of the rural market capacity has a very rapid and huge impact on cities. In March of last year, false purchasing power disappeared, and industry and commerce were in deep trouble in April and May. By autumn, when industrialists and businessmen were still continuing to tighten their operations, purchase orders from rural areas suddenly poured in. Thus, one thing moved everything, and cities generally prospered: the number of industrial and commercial establishments increased month by month, the number of unemployed people gradually decreased, and national tax revenue also increased significantly. The business volume of taxpayers in Beijing in the autumn increased by 57% compared with the era of false purchasing power in the spring. In Tianjin, the total capital of industrial households in September increased by 556,000 odd real units compared with August, and the average power per household increased by 9.4 horsepower. In Shanghai, the output and sales of cotton yarn, wool yarn, papermaking, flour, and rubber shoes in October, the production of cigarettes and chemical alkali, the sales of matches, etc., all exceeded the level of January. Small and medium-sized cities are more active in industry and commerce because they are closer to rural areas.
    Although the quantity of native products purchased by state-owned companies in the past year is very large, it is only a very small part of all agricultural products. Farmers in many cotton-producing areas urgently need food, coal, and livestock feed, but they are suffering from being unable to quickly sell the cotton in their hands. Farmers in other regions have the same requirements. They urgently need to sell everything in exchange for what they need. Therefore, the relevant departments of the Central People's Government and the people's governments at all levels are starting from five aspects to solve this problem.
    The first is to universally adopt the contract system to develop product exchanges between major administrative regions, between provinces, between counties, and between urban and rural areas. Cooperatives at all levels are actively carrying out this task. The All-China Federation of Cooperatives has organized the first exchange between the three major administrative regions of Northeast, North China, and East China. Before the end of June this year, the Northeast will transport 100,000 tons each of coarse grains, soybean cake, and soybeans to North China and East China. At the same time, North China and East China will transport 2 million jin of lint cotton and 600,000 bolts of various cloths to the Northeast. The All-China Federation of Cooperatives has also organized the exchange contract of a large number of grains, native cloth, and iron goods between the five provinces of North China, thus solving the problem of the outlet of most of the native products in individual provinces. In addition, within Shandong Province, the Provincial Federation of Cooperatives is exchanging 55,000 bolts of colored cloth, 36 million jin of grain, and a batch of soybean cake fertilizer for farmers' tobacco and peanuts.
    The second is for cooperatives to purchase on credit from farmers to facilitate the exchange of native products. When cooperatives repay the credit, they listen to the rise but not the fall according to the market price, ensuring that farmers do not suffer losses. This method has been implemented in some cotton-producing areas and is deeply supported by farmers.
    The third is to develop rural credit relations and encourage farmers to deposit goods in cooperatives, and cooperatives will provide credit loans when farmers need them.
    The fourth is to assist cooperatives and encourage private individuals to establish warehouses to facilitate merchants' exchanges and material circulation, quickly restore the former commercial network, and establish new commercial networks.
    The fifth is to organize private industrial and commercial operators to engage in urban-rural exchanges. The Yanbei Datong Special Zone of Chahar Province has organized an urban-rural economic committee. The committee is to guide private industrial and commercial operators to go to the countryside to purchase in the form of joint purchases or joint operations, or to bring agricultural tools and other industrial products to the countryside to directly exchange with farmers. This work has achieved good results.
    Organizing the exchange of native products according to these methods is an extremely complex and important task, which contains many difficulties that must be overcome. The completion of this work, which is of utmost importance in the current national economic life, depends on the government workers in various places to fully exert their enthusiasm and creativity, closely contact the masses, make careful calculations, and do it boldly.

### 组织土产畅流是财经工作中心环节

　　组织土产畅流是财经工作中心环节
    组织土产的畅流是目前振兴全国经济的中心环节。这是一年来财政经济工作的最重要的经验之一。
    去年夏季以来特别是秋收之后，国营贸易公司收购了大量的土产。从去年一月到十一月，各专业公司在关内各地直接收购和委托合作社代购的农产品中，计有粮食二十亿斤以上，棉花约五百万担，猪鬃九百万斤，鸡蛋九万万个，以及大量的绒毛、皮子、油脂、茶叶、蚕茧、烟叶、核桃等等。除猪鬃、茶叶等少数几项之外，其余绝大部分是在六月以后收购的。
    土产的畅销首先使农民的生活水准和购买力大为提高，这在土地改革已经完成的地区尤为明显。以河北产棉区为例，棉农们普遍地大量地购置了农具和肥料，修建了房舍，添制了新衣，并且消纳了大量的其他各种日用工业产品。带篾壳的暖水瓶，以及梳子、镜子、毛巾、袜子之类曾大量地行销于产棉区农村之中。据河北省产棉区成安县魏西村的调查：全村四百户人家总共一千七百多人口，秋后新买自行车一百一十辆，平均每四户一辆，手电筒八百多个，平均每两人一个。
    农村市场容量的扩大，对城市的影响是非常迅速和巨大的。去年三月间虚假购买力消失，四五两月工商业深处于困境。一到秋季，当工商业者还在继续紧缩经营的时候，农村的购货单忽然源源而来，于是一牵百动，各个城市普遍繁荣起来：工商开业户逐月增多，失业人数日渐减少，国家税收也显著增加。北京全市纳税户秋季营业额，比春季虚假购买力统治的时代增加了百分之五十七。天津九月份各工业户资金总额比八月份增加了五十五万六千多个折实单位，动力方面平均每户增加了九点四匹马力。上海十月份棉纱、毛纱、造纸、面粉、胶鞋等业的产销量，卷烟、化学碱的生产量、火柴的销售量等等，都超过了一月份的水平。中小城市由于更靠近农村，工商业更为活跃。
    一年来国营公司收购的土产数量虽然十分庞大，但还只是全部农产中极其微小的一部分。许多棉产区的农民急需食粮、煤炭和牲畜饲料等等，却苦于无法迅速脱售他们手中的棉花。其他地区的农民也有着同样的要求。他们急须出售所有，以换取所需。因此中央人民政府的有关部门和各级地方人民政府正从五个方面着手来解决这个问题。
    第一是普遍采用合同制以开展各大行政区之间，省与省之间，县与县之间，城与乡之间的产品交流。各地各级合作社正在积极执行这个任务。全国合作总社已经组织了东北、华北、华东三个大行政区之间的第一次交换，在今年六月底以前，东北将以粗粮、豆饼和大豆各十万吨运往华北和华东，同时华北和华东将以皮棉二百万斤和各种布六十万匹运往东北。合作总社又组织了华北五省之间大批粮食、土布和铁货的交换合同，由此解决了个别省份大部分土产的出路问题。此外，在山东省内，合作社省联社正以花色布五万五千匹、粮食三千六百万斤和一批豆饼肥料换取农民的烟叶和花生米。
    第二是由合作社向农民进行赊购，以通畅土产的交流。合作社偿还赊款时按市价听涨不听落，保证农民不受损失。这办法已在部分产棉区实行，深为农民所拥护。
    第三是开展农村信贷关系，鼓励农民以实物存入合作社，合作社在农民需要时予以信用贷款。
    第四是协助合作社和鼓励私人普遍建立货栈，以便利商贩往来和物资流转，迅速恢复从前的商业网和建立新的商业网。
    第五是组织私营工商业者从事城乡交流。察哈尔省雁北大同专区组织了一个城乡经济委员会。该会即是指导私人工商业者用联购或联营的方式下乡收购，或携带农具和其他工业品下乡直接和农民进行交换，这一工作已收到了很好的效果。
    根据这些办法来组织土产交流是一种极其繁复而重大的工作，其中包含着许多必须克服的困难。这一在目前全国经济生活中具有头等重要性的工作的完成，有赖于各地人民政府工作人员充分发挥自己的积极性和创造性，密切联系群众，精打细算而又大刀阔斧地去做。
