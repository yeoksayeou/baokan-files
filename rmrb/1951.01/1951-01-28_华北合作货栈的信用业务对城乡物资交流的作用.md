　　The Role of Credit Business of North China Cooperative Warehouses in Urban-Rural Material Exchange

　　Before the old urban-rural exchange relationships have been fully restored, local cooperative warehouses have undertaken a part of the task of connecting urban and rural trade. The business of North China Cooperative Warehouses has therefore expanded, focusing on promoting local products and exchanging them for industrial goods. Although there were slow months in the latter half of last year for five months, the operating amount reached 110% of that from January to June. With the increasing amount of agricultural products entering the city, sales channels need to be gradually opened up, and local products need to be sold in batches. In this situation, cooperative societies at all levels, in order to accelerate urban-rural trade, first take short-term loans to buy back industrial products, and then exchange them for agricultural products, in order to promote the sales of members' local products as much as possible, and then repay in batches with the proceeds from the sale of goods. As a result, cooperative societies at all levels have increasingly requested to handle deposit and loan business through warehouses.

　　In accordance with Article 38 of the Common Program, which states "encouraging and supporting the broad masses of working people to develop cooperative undertakings according to the principle of voluntariness, and organizing supply and marketing cooperatives, consumer cooperatives, credit cooperatives, production cooperatives, and transportation cooperatives in towns and villages," and the requirements of the cadres of each cooperative, the North China Cooperative Warehouses, in conjunction with the banks, have handled credit business (including current and fixed deposits, short-term, fixed-term, and mortgage loans, etc.) to facilitate the lending of cooperative societies at all levels, so that cooperatives can achieve accelerated exchange of industrial and agricultural products through mutual assistance in funds. The warehouses also absorb the short-term idle funds of each cooperative, organize them, and support friendly cooperatives with short-term loans for the sale of local products, quickly buying back industrial products to supply to members. In addition, it is clearly stipulated that non-cooperative systems are not allowed to deposit funds, so as to concentrate efforts to support the exchange of materials of cooperative societies.

　　Experience over the past year has proved that if cooperative warehouses only organize the exchange of industrial and agricultural products without organizing credit business to support the exchange, it will not be possible to solve the difficulties of cooperative societies at all levels in the exchange process. For example, the Export Department of the North China Cooperative General Society wanted to purchase local products (peanuts, walnuts, wool, etc.) from cooperative societies at all levels for processing and export, but was unable to do so due to a temporary lack of funds. They borrowed more than 2 billion from the deposits of cooperative societies in the warehouse and purchased the local products of each cooperative. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region General Society transported more than 500,000 jin of Tianjin jute and 200,000 jin of black melon seeds, which could not be sold all at once, so they first borrowed money to buy back industrial products. The Chahar Province General Society transported 620,000 jin of Tianjin rapeseed and borrowed 200 million yuan to buy back city cloth. The Shanxi Province General Society transported 440,000 jin of Tianjin peach kernels and 200,000 jin of wool, first borrowing 700 million yuan to buy back city cloth, etc. In addition, only 13 cooperative societies in Pingyuan Province, Shijiazhuang, Changzhi, Handan, Yuci, and Daming transported a total of 4.13 million jin of Tianjin persimmon cakes, peach kernels, wheat, peanuts, pepper, etc., and solved the difficulties in their exchange process through more than 3 billion yuan of credit loans. It is precisely because the credit business plays a great role in urban-rural exchange that cooperative societies at all levels strongly support the operation of credit business by cooperative warehouses.

　　The total amount of deposits and loans of North China Cooperative Warehouses in the past year was 298.7 billion yuan, of which deposits were more than 211.4 billion, accounting for nearly 71% of the total, and loans were more than 87.2 billion, accounting for just over 29%. In the first and second quarters, deposits accounted for just over 71%, and loans accounted for just under 29%. In the third quarter, deposits accounted for just over 68%, and loans accounted for 32%. In the fourth quarter, deposits accounted for 73%, and loans accounted for 27%. From the above figures, it can be seen that deposits have been more than loans in the past year. Although most of the funds have been organized in form, they have not been fully utilized to play their role in supporting urban-rural exchange and enlivening the trade of cooperative societies. The reason is that there is insufficient understanding of the fact that operating this type of business can promote urban-rural trade and assist the promotion of industrial products, so they have not been able to contact the cadres of each cooperative in a timely manner to understand the difficulties they have encountered in the exchange process and provide timely financial assistance, resulting in a wait-and-see attitude. In the future, local warehouses should earnestly develop credit business to support urban-rural exchange and invigorate the trade work of cooperative societies.

### 华北合作货栈的信用业务对城乡物资交流的作用

　　华北合作货栈的信用业务对城乡物资交流的作用
    在目前旧有的城乡交换关系尚未充分恢复起来之前，各地合作货栈，就担负了一部分沟通城乡贸易的任务。华北合作货栈的业务，因而也日益扩大，它着重于推销土产，换购工业品。去年下半年五个月虽有淡月，但经营数额竟达一月至六月的百分之一百一十。在农产品进城数量日益增加，而销路需逐渐开辟，土产需分批出售的情况下，各级合作社为了加速城乡贸易，先行短期借贷，买回工业品，再换购农产品，以期尽量推销社员的土产，然后再以售出货款分批偿还。这样，各级合作社要求通过货栈办理存款借款的就逐日增加。
    华北合作货栈根据共同纲领第三十八条“鼓励和扶助广大劳动人民根据自愿原则，发展合作事业。在城镇中和乡村中组织供销合作社、消费合作社、信用合作社、生产合作社和运输合作社”的精神，及各社干部的要求，结合银行办理了信用业务（包括活期、定期存款，短期、定期、抵押借款等）以便利各级合作社的借贷，使社与社间通过在资金上的互助，达到加速工农产品的交换。货栈并吸收各社短期不用的分散资金，加以组织，接济支持存有土产待销的短期借款的友社，很快地买回工业品供给社员。此外，又明确规定非合作系统的概不存放，以便集中力量支持合作社的物资交换。
    一年来的经验证明，合作货栈只组织工农产品的交换，而不组织信用业务以支持交换，就不能解决各级社在交换过程中的困难。如华北合作总社出口部想收购各级合作社的土产（花生米、核桃仁、羊毛等）加工出口，因一时缺乏资金，无力进行，从货栈各社存款中借了二十多亿，收购了各社的土产；内蒙古自治区总社运津麻五十多万斤、黑瓜子二十万斤，一时不能全部售出，先借款买回工业品；察省总社运津菜籽六十二万斤，借二亿元买回市布；山西省总社运津桃仁四十四万斤、羊毛二十万斤，先借款七亿买回市布等。此外，仅平原省、石家庄、长治、邯郸、榆次、大名等十三个社运津柿饼、桃仁、小麦、花生米、花椒等共四百十三万斤，通过三十多亿的信用贷款，解决了他们交换过程中的困难。正由于信用业务对城乡交换作用很大，所以各级合作社对合作货栈经营信用业务，十分拥护。
    华北合作货栈一年来存放总额为二、九八七亿元，其中存入为二、一一四亿多，占总额百分之七十一弱，贷出八七二亿多，占百分之二十九强。第一、二季度存入占百分之七十一强，借出占百分之二十九弱；第三季度存入占百分之六十八强，借出占百分之三十二；第四季度存入占百分之七十三，借出占百分之二十七。从以上数字可以看出，一年来是存多贷少，大部资金，虽然在形式上组织起来，但没有充分被利用，以发挥其支持城乡交换、活跃合作社贸易的效能。其原因是对经营此种业务，可以促进城乡贸易，协助工业产品的推销，认识不足，因而未及时深入与各社干部联系，了解他们在交换过程中的困难，及时予以资金上的帮助，以致形成了坐等。今后各地货栈应认真开展信用业务，以支持城乡交换，活跃合作社的贸易工作。
