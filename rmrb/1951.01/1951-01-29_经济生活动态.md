　　Economic Life Dynamics
  Northeast Second Textile Factory Increases Production
    The mechanics department of the Northeast Second Textile Factory recently created a new record of manufacturing 180 large screws in nine hours, an increase of almost double the previous maximum production of 100. Many moving model deeds have emerged among the factory's workers in the patriotic production competition, and production is gradually increasing.
  Ding County People's Bank Increases Deposits
    The Ding County Special District Office of the People's Bank of China and its subordinate branches actively served depositors in deposit business last year, such as personally picking up and delivering money to depositors' homes, collecting and paying cash on behalf of depositors, and paying wages on their behalf, which was convenient for depositors, so they were willing to deposit money in the bank. As a result, bank deposits increased significantly. The average deposit balance in December last year exceeded four times the balance in the first quarter of last year, of which private industrial and commercial deposits exceeded 9.7 times.
  Gao City Transforms 700 Mu of Bad Land into Good Land
    The 700 mu of land south of Sigong Village in Gaocheng, Hebei, is sandy and alkaline land, and it is very difficult to plant seeds every year. Sun Wenzhu, a production expert, began to study soil improvement in 1943 and worked hard for two winters and one spring, finally successfully improving it. After several years of efforts by the villagers, the 700 mu of bad land has now been turned into good land, increasing grain production by 280 shi every year.
