Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, January 8th: The West German "Bielefeld" polling institute posed some questions to people from all walks of life in West Germany, saying: "If you were asked to be a soldier again, or your son or husband was asked to be a soldier, would you think it was right?" In June 1949, 60.2 percent of those questioned opposed re-enlistment. By November 1950, 73.4 percent of residents had expressed opposition to any form of West German re-militarization. The negative responses came mostly from veterans.

　　西德人民反对再当兵
    【新华社十日讯】塔斯社柏林八日讯：西德的“俾里菲尔德”民意测验所向西德各阶层人民提出了一些问题说：“如果要你再次当兵或者要你的儿子或丈夫当兵，你认为对么？”在一九四九年六月，被问者百分之六十点二反对再当兵。到一九五○年十一月，已经有百分之七十三点四的居民表示反对任何形式的西德重新军事化。否定的答复大部分来自退伍军人。
