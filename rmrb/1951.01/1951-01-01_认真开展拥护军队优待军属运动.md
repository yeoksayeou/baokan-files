　　Central People's Government Allocates Grain to Console Families of Revolutionary Martyrs in Henan

　　【Xinhua News Agency Dispatch】Kaifeng News: The Central People's Government has allocated 1.8 million catties of grain to Henan Province for the purpose of consoling families of revolutionary martyrs. On November 18, 1950, the Henan Provincial People's Government transferred the grain to various regions. The Henan Provincial People's Government also notified the relevant local people's governments to comfort the families of martyrs with a high degree of revolutionary enthusiasm and to solve their practical difficulties.

　　During the periods of the Land Revolution, the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the War of Liberation, many revolutionary patriots sacrificed their lives due to the insane massacres by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in Henan Province. Before the liberation of the province, the families of these martyrs suffered greatly from the severe persecution and trampling by Chiang Kai-shek's special agents and local despotic landlords. In order to properly comfort the families of martyrs, the Central People's Government specially allocated 1.8 million catties of grain to the province for the families of martyrs. This relief grain will be focused on areas that were bloodily washed by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, such as Huangchuan, Suixian, Qixian, and Taikang.

　　North China Peasants Consciously Cultivate Land on Behalf of Families of Martyrs and Servicemen

　　【Xinhua News Agency Dispatch】In 1950, the People's Governments in most parts of North China paid attention to strengthening the work of cultivating land on behalf of the families of martyrs and servicemen. They ensured timely cultivation, improved farming practices, and increased grain yields, thus guaranteeing the livelihood of the families of martyrs and servicemen who lacked labor.

　　The general practice of cultivating land on behalf of others in various places has changed from the previous method of assigning tasks in shifts and temporarily allocating labor. The "contract cultivation system" has been widely promoted, which has greatly improved the cultivation of land belonging to families of martyrs and servicemen. For example, in Huguan County, Shanxi Province, the land of all families of martyrs and servicemen in the county received an average of 83 loads of fertilizer per mu, exceeding the amount of fertilizer applied to the land of ordinary farmers. In Pingshun County and other places, the land of families of martyrs and servicemen was also repaired with borders and embankments. In Hebei Province, the land of families of martyrs and servicemen was generally cultivated twice and weeded four times. In the provinces of Pingyuan and Chahar, in addition to meticulously cultivating the land of families of martyrs and servicemen, they also ensured that they were the first to plant and harvest for them. Due to the implementation of the "contract cultivation system" and the improvement of farming methods, the yield of crops has greatly increased. For example, the 35.4 mu of land cultivated on behalf of others in Zhaiguan Village, Yushe County, Shanxi Province, had an expected yield of 33.1 shi. As a result of the implementation of the "contract cultivation system" in 1950, the actual yield increased to 55.07 shi. Liu Anyi, a model cultivator in Xiyang County, cultivated the land on behalf of others with deep plowing and meticulous care, increasing the yield per mu by 54 percent compared to the land of ordinary farmers. This has greatly guaranteed the livelihood of the families of martyrs and servicemen.

　　The frequent inspection of the land cultivation work by governments at all levels, as well as the encouragement of families of martyrs and servicemen to engage in diligent production and overcome their dependence, is an important experience in doing a good job in cultivating land on behalf of others in North China. The area has widely established village-level land cultivation committees, which regularly inspect the situation of land cultivation and convene meetings of families of martyrs and servicemen to solicit opinions on land cultivation, thereby promoting and improving the work of land cultivation. In Lin County, Pingyuan Province, the work of land cultivation was carefully inspected at the people's representative conferences at the district and village levels. The First District of Lin County also invited representatives to visit the crops cultivated on behalf of others in the fields and gave commendations and criticisms for the merits and demerits of the land cultivation achievements.

　　The peasants in the old liberated areas generally understand the significance of cultivating land on behalf of others. Yue Guide, a peasant in Chongchuan Village, Yushe County, said: "We are now able to live a happy life because the country has millions of troops who can fight. If we don't cultivate the land well on behalf of others, then we have truly forgotten our roots." Therefore, in addition to consciously doing a good job in cultivating the land on behalf of others, the peasants also warmly take care of the daily lives of the families of martyrs and servicemen. In Zuquan County, Shanxi Province, the families of martyrs and servicemen generally have "water in their jars and firewood piled up in their courtyards." In many villages in Hebei, Pingyuan, and other provinces, the peasants collect firewood and manure for the families of martyrs and servicemen in winter and show respect for the families of martyrs and servicemen. However, at present, the methods of cultivating land on behalf of others in some areas of North China are still somewhat chaotic, and a small number of people are still unable to consciously carry out land cultivation. In particular, in the newly liberated areas that lack a foundation for land cultivation work, there are still phenomena of wasteland and rough cultivation of land belonging to families of martyrs and servicemen, and some families of servicemen still have a mentality of dependence, thus increasing the burden on peasants who cultivate land on behalf of others. At present, the people's governments in various places are further improving the work of land cultivation.

　　Jiangxi's Revolutionary Martyrs, Servicemen, and Workers' Families Receive Preferential Treatment and Respect

　　【Xinhua News Agency Dispatch】In Jiangxi Province, the families of revolutionary martyrs, servicemen, and working cadres receive preferential treatment and respect from the people's government and the broad masses of the people. In 1950 alone, according to incomplete statistics from twenty counties in the six special districts of Ganzhou, Ji'an, Shangrao, Fuzhou, and Nanchang, the peasant masses cultivated more than 23,400 mu of land on behalf of families of martyrs, servicemen, and workers who lacked labor. In order to take care of the families of martyrs, servicemen, and workers who had more difficulties in life, the provincial people's government allocated 5.82 million catties of preferential treatment rice and more than 7.81 million yuan of preferential treatment money. The local people's governments also organized some families of martyrs, servicemen, and honorable servicemen to participate in various jobs or cooperative production. In order to enable the children of families of martyrs and servicemen to receive education, five supplementary schools for children of families of martyrs and servicemen were established in Ningdu, Shangrao, Ji'an, Ganzhou, Fuliang, and other five counties, where more than 1,300 children of families of martyrs and servicemen were given free admission. During festivals, the masses in various places enthusiastically launched movements to support the army and give preferential treatment to families of servicemen, holding discussions and gatherings with families of martyrs and servicemen, hanging honorary plaques in the homes of families of martyrs and servicemen, and sending condolences to families of martyrs and servicemen with gongs and drums.

　　In order to further strengthen the work of giving preferential treatment to families of martyrs, servicemen, and workers, Ji'an, Ningdu, Jiujiang, Fuliang, and other cities and counties have recently convened representative conferences of families of martyrs, servicemen, and workers. Fuliang, Hukou, and other counties have also established preferential treatment committees and preferential treatment groups to go deep into the countryside to express condolences to families of martyrs, servicemen, and workers.

　　Beijing Municipality to Launch Movement to Support the Army and Give Preferential Treatment to Families of Servicemen

　　【Beijing Municipal News Agency Dispatch】Beijing Municipality will launch a movement to support the government and cherish the people and support the army and give preferential treatment to families of servicemen during the New Year and Spring Festival. On December 25, the Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau notified the city and suburban districts to conduct the movement in appropriate ways based on the specific circumstances of their districts, according to the joint instructions issued on the 22nd by the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government and the General Political Department of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission. The notice stipulates that before the New Year, each district should distribute the winter preferential treatment grain for 1950 (a total of 500,000 catties in the city) to focus on subsidizing the lives of poor military families; actively prepare to convene military family symposiums and gatherings during the New Year or Spring Festival, in conjunction with the movement to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, and invite local troops, honorary servicemen, and demobilized soldiers to participate. At the meetings, they should comfort military families, congratulate and celebrate the meritorious families, report on the organization of military family production, the establishment of housework, and employment, and reward production models. In addition, Mayor Nie Rongzhen and Deputy Mayors Zhang Youyu and Wu Han printed 20,000 New Year cards and sent one to each household of martyrs, honorable servicemen, servicemen, and workers in the city. On the New Year cards of the mayor and deputy mayors were written: "To celebrate the New Year, we must do our best to defeat the US imperialist aggression, consolidate our hard-won victories, defend the security of our motherland, and defend world peace. We must support the ongoing movement to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea in all aspects with exemplary actions until the final victory."

　　认真开展拥护军队优待军属运动
            中央人民政府  拨粮抚恤河南革命烈士家属
    【新华社讯】开封讯：中央人民政府拨发河南省的革命烈士家属抚恤粮一百八十万斤，已于一九五○年十一月十八日由河南省人民政府转拨各地。河南省人民政府并通知有关各地人民政府，要以高度的革命热情安抚烈士家属，并切实解决他们的困难问题。
    河南省在土地革命、抗日战争和解放战争时期，由于蒋匪帮疯狂屠杀而牺牲的革命志士很多。该省解放前，这些烈士们的家属，备受蒋匪特务分子及地方恶霸地主的严重摧残和蹂躏。中央人民政府为适当安抚烈士家属，特于月前拨发该省烈士家属抚恤粮一百八十万斤。此项抚恤粮将重点地用在曾被蒋匪血洗过的潢川、睢县、杞县、太康等地。
            华北农民自觉为烈军属代耕
    【新华社讯】华北大部地区的人民政府在一九五○年中注意到加强对烈、军属的代耕工作，做到了耕种及时，改进农作，提高粮食产量，使缺乏劳动力的烈、军属的生活有了保障。
    各地代耕一般已改变了轮流派差，临时拨工等办法，较普遍地推行了“包耕制”的代耕办法，使烈、军属，土地的耕作得到很大的改进。如山西壶关县全县烈、军属的土地，每亩平均施肥八十三担，超过了一般农民土地的施肥量。平顺县等地烈、军属的土地，都进行了修边垒堰。河北省烈、军属土地，一般作到了耕二遍锄四遍。平原、察哈尔两省各地除做到对烈、军属的土地精耕细作外，并做到为他们先耕种先收获。由于实行“包耕制”和改进耕作法，大大地增加了农作物的产量。如山西省榆社县翟管村的三十五亩四分代耕土地，应产量为三十三石一斗，一九五○年实行“包耕制”的结果，实产量增加到五十五石零七斗。昔阳县代耕模范刘安义对代耕地深耕细作，使每亩的产量超过一般农民土地产量的百分之五十四。这样就很好地保障了烈、军属的生活。
    各级政府对代耕工作进行经常的检查，并鼓励烈、军属勤劳生产，克服其依赖思想，是华北各地作好代耕工作的重要经验。该区各地普遍建立了村的代耕委员会，经常检查代耕的情形，并召开烈、军属会议征求对代耕的意见，因而推动和改进了代耕工作。平原省林县等地在区、村各界人民代表会议上都认真检查了代耕工作。林县第一区并请代表们到地里参观代耕的庄稼，对代耕成绩的优劣分别给予表扬和批评。
    老解放区的农民们大都了解代耕的意义。榆社县崇串村农民岳贵德说：“现在咱们能过幸福的生活，就是因为国家有了几百万能打仗的队伍。要是我们不好好代耕，那真是忘了本。”所以农民们除自觉地作好代耕之外，并热烈照顾烈、军属的日常生活。山西左权等县对烈、军属普遍做到“缸里常有水，院里堆满柴”。河北、平原等省各地不少村庄的农民们，在冬季给烈、军属积柴、积肥，并且对烈、军属表示尊敬。但目前华北部分地区的代耕办法还有些混乱，少数群众还不能自觉地进行代耕。特别是缺乏代耕工作基础的新解放区，烈、军属的土地还有荒芜与耕种粗糙的现象，而部分军属尚存在着依赖心理，因此加重了农民代耕的负担。现各地人民政府正进一步改善代耕工作。
            江西烈军工属受到优待尊敬
    【新华社讯】江西省的革命烈士、军人和工作干部家属受到人民政府和广大群众的优待和尊敬。一九五○年一年中仅赣州、吉安、上饶、抚州、南昌六个专区二十个县的不完全统计，农民群众代替缺乏劳动力的烈、军、工属耕种田地二万三千四百余亩。为了照顾生活困难较多的烈、军、工属，省人民政府曾拨发优抚米五百八十二万斤，优抚金七百八十一万余元。所属各地人民政府并组织部分烈、军属和荣誉军人参加了各种工作或合作社生产。为了使烈、军属子弟受到教育，宁都、上饶、吉安、赣州、浮梁等五县成立了五所烈、军属子弟补习学校，有一千三百多烈、军属子弟得到免费入学，每逢过节，各地群众就热烈展开拥军优属运动，和烈、军属座谈、联欢，给烈、军属家中挂光荣匾，并且敲锣打鼓的送慰劳品给烈、军属。
    为了进一步加强对烈、军、工属优待工作，吉安、宁都、九江、浮梁等市县最近已召开了烈、军、工属代表会议，浮梁、湖口等县并已成立优属委员会和优属小组，深入农村慰问烈、军、工属。
            京市即将展开拥军优属运动
    【京市新闻处讯】京市在新年及春节期间将展开拥政爱民和拥军优属运动。市民政局于十二月二十五日通知城、郊各区要根据中央人民政府内务部、人民革命军事委员会总政治部二十二日联合发出的指示，结合本区具体情况，采用适当方式进行。通知规定：各区在新年以前发放一九五○年度冬季优待粮（全市共五十万斤）重点补助贫苦军属生活；积极准备在新年或春节，结合抗美援朝运动，分别召开军属座谈会、联欢会，并邀请地方驻军、荣誉军人、复员军人参加，在会上应慰劳军属，向立功家属庆功贺喜，报告组织军属生产，建立家务和就业的情况，奖励生产模范。此外，聂荣臻市长、张友渔、吴晗副市长印制了贺年片两万张，送发本市烈、荣、军、工属每户一张。市长与副市长的贺年片上写着“庆贺新年，我们要以全力来击败美帝的侵略，巩固既得胜利，保卫祖国的安全，保卫世界和平，我们要在各方面以模范的行动支持正在开展着的抗美援朝运动，直到最后胜利”。
