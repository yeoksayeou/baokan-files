	A Film Exposing Anti-Soviet Conspiracies:
	A Review of "Secret Mission"
	Mei Lingyi

	After watching the movie "Secret Mission," written by K. Isaev and M. Maklyarsky, and directed by M. Romm, people are attracted by the story and plot, whose suspense is no less than "Eternal Secret" and "The Blue Road." People are sure to care about the risks and achievements of the intelligence agent Marta, and are deeply moved by her high degree of patriotism. The broad Chinese film audience will certainly love this work. However, what "Secret Mission" gives to the audience is not only these things, and these have not obscured or weakened the main ideological content of this work. On the contrary, these precisely strengthen the expression of the work's main ideological content: a profound exposure of the anti-Soviet conspiracies of American and British imperialism.

	Today, the purpose of a series of crimes committed by the imperialist bloc headed by American imperialism—the group of instigators of war—is to oppose the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. When did this start? Leaving aside the foreign armed intervention of 1918-20, which vainly attempted to "strangle communism in its cradle," as the film points out, as early as the end of the Soviet Great Patriotic War, when the Soviet army, which had liberated Romania, Bulgaria, and most of Hungary, advanced its combat to the Budapest and Carpathian Mountain regions, and toward the Vistula River (early January 1945), the conspiracy had already begun actively. Everyone knows that during the war, the United States and Britain were allies of the Soviet Union, jointly fighting to crush Hitler's aggression. However, the same United States and the same Britain were preparing to oppose the Soviet Union together with Hitler. On the American side, a Republican congressman, a member of the arms industry association, and a significant shareholder of the German chemical conglomerate, and his partner Kalvey, flew from New York to Berlin at Himmler's invitation (they were the secret envoys); while the British Prime Minister at the time, Winston Churchill, in order to save the retreating British and American troops on the Western Front, requested a Soviet offensive, while at the same time hoping that the Soviet Red Army would be tied down on the Eastern Front. Churchill notified the "secret envoys" in Berlin of the date of the Soviet offensive, which was equivalent to notifying the German invaders, giving them time to add sixty-five divisions from the Western Front to the existing two hundred and sixteen divisions on the Eastern Front.

	There were contradictions between the United States and Britain (the film mentioned this through Churchill), but they were consistent on the point of betraying the alliance and opposing the Soviet Union. Because of the fear of popular opposition, they dared not openly conduct negotiations with the German invaders to make peace, but planned for the secret surrender of the German invaders—non-resistance to the "offensive" of American and British troops from the Western Front, allowing American and British troops to enter German territory before the Soviet Red Army. Thus, we see such a clear fact from the film: on the Eastern Front, the Soviet army shattered the "copper wall and iron barrier" defense line with a depth of five hundred kilometers and the stubborn resistance of the German invaders with fierce battles, paying a considerable price in lives and blood. On the Western Front, the German invaders gave way to the American and British troops, as Himmler said to the congressman: "Your army can advance forward without any hindrance, our guarding troops are sure to surrender their guns, even sending a few soldiers riding bicycles or drunk soldiers without guns into the city will do." Even so, they still could not realize their vicious conspiracy. The advance speed of the Soviet army, which was fighting hard on the Eastern Front, was thirty kilometers a day, while the advance speed of the American and British troops on the Western Front, although they encountered no resistance, was ten kilometers a day. It was clear that the Soviet army was about to enter German territory—eastern Germany—first.

	The United States was not reconciled to this situation. Thus, we see a further conspiracy: the United States massively bombed the industry in eastern Germany while preserving the industry in the west, so that the former would not fall into the hands of the Soviet Union, and prepared to seize the latter to prepare for a new war—an anti-Soviet war.

	Today, the United States is restoring the military industrial production of West Germany, making it the European arsenal for the anti-Soviet war. However, the conspiracy at that time was not limited to this. At the same time, through Bormann's hands, the United States accepted the German invaders' Balkan intelligence network—the list of spies in Eastern Europe, attempting to use these people who were "well-trained, good at killing and selling their lives, and mainly they oppose communist Russia" (as Bormann said to the congressman), to carry out anti-Soviet sabotage. The German intelligence chief Schellenberg also helped to arrange for the spies to establish relations with representatives of American envoys and American embassies in Gilen, Budapest, Sofia, Belgrade... instructing the spies to "mix into various ministries, troops, into the Fatherland Front government, into the Communist Party leadership organs... The second task is arson, sabotage and slowdown. Organize terrorist activities... Eliminate the communist leaders, kill those communists." Schellenberg said to Kalvey: "I have handed over the inheritance to you." This precisely meant that Hitler handed over his inheritance to the likes of Truman and Dulles. Today, the latter is desperately trying to realize Hitler's delusion!

	Here, we should affirm the extraordinary talent of the screenwriters and directors. Faced with such an event—a series of conspiracies—they precisely and comprehensively expressed certain main links, and deeply excavated and prominently depicted them. When they revealed the anti-Soviet conspiracies of the secret envoys layer by layer, they also raised the audience's vigilance with increasing urgency and ignited the flames of the audience's anger. We see the congressmen, Kalvey, Churchill, Van Jin Kuolong, Gilen... on the screen, we not only want to spit on their despicable shamelessness, but also hate and punish their crimes.

	On the other side depicted by the screenwriters and directors is the power of the people who oppose this group of criminals, oppose war, oppose collusion with fascists, oppose "anti-Sovietism," and demand peace. For this group of criminals, the people are just as Bormann pointed out, "dangerous." The film depicts: an American driver who is "not interested in politics and likes to read the sports section in the newspaper" punched the congressman down fiercely, he suspected why the congressman appeared in Berlin, he did not believe that those Russian friends who had repaired his plane would be his enemies. In Berlin, German communists were active, and anti-war leaflets appeared in the air-raid shelters; on May 9, 1945, not only in Moscow, but also in New York and London, people celebrated the victory by shouting "Long live world peace." When the Churchills decided to launch a new war—an anti-Soviet war—he also understood that he needed the people to "not hinder" them. The facts indicate that the people are certain to hinder them—to prevent them from launching a new war. The tens of millions of people who signed the Stockholm Appeal are a powerful "hindrance"!

	The story of "Secret Mission" ended in cheers. From London to Moscow, the same shout of "Long Live Stalin" was heard. This is no accident. The anti-Soviet conspiracies of American and British imperialism revealed in the film "Secret Mission" will be crushed under the great power of hundreds of millions of people who demand world peace and shout "Long Live Stalin"!

### 一部揭露反苏阴谋的影片  “秘密使节”评介

　　一部揭露反苏阴谋的影片
    “秘密使节”评介
    梅令宜
    看了Ｋ·伊沙也夫、Ｍ·马克良尔斯基编剧，Ｍ·罗姆导演的电影“秘密使节”，人们被那紧张性不弱于“永远的秘密”和“蔚蓝色的道路”的故事和情节所吸引，人们一定关心着敌工人员玛尔达的涉险和成就，为她的高度的爱国主义精神所深深的感动。广大的中国电影观众一定会喜爱这部作品的。但是，“秘密使节”所给与观众的，不只这些，而这些也没有掩蔽了或削弱了这部作品的主要思想内容。相反的，这些恰好加强了这部作品的主要思想内容的表现：深刻的揭露了美英帝国主义的反苏阴谋。
    今天，以美帝为首的帝国主义集团——战争挑拨者集团所进行的、违反全世界爱好和平人们的意愿的一连串罪行的目的，就是反对苏联和人民民主国家。这是从什么时候开始的呢？姑且不说一九一八——二○年的外国武装干涉，妄想“从摇篮里掏死共产主义”，就在苏联伟大卫国战争的末期，解放了罗马尼亚、保加利亚及大部分匈牙利的苏联军队，把战斗推进到布达佩斯和喀尔巴阡山地区，推向维斯拉河之际（一九四五年一月初），如电影所指明的，阴谋已经开始积极进行了。大家都知道，在大战时期，美国和英国都是苏联的盟国，共同为了粉碎希特勒的侵略作战。可是，就是同一个美国和同一个英国，却准备与希特勒一道反对苏联了。在美帝方面，有一位共和党议员、军火工业协会会员、德国化学联合企业的相当重要股东，和他的伙伴卡尔维，应希姆莱之约，由纽约飞到了柏林（他们就是秘密使节）；而英国当时的首相威士顿·邱吉尔，为了拯救西战场上败退的英、美军队，请求苏联进攻，而同时又希望苏联红军在东战场上被缠住。邱吉尔把苏联进攻的日期通知了在柏林的“秘密使节”，就等于通知了德寇，使德寇来得及把西战场上的六十五个师，加到已有二百一十六个师的东战场上。
    英、美之间不是没有矛盾的（电影曾借邱吉尔提及了这一点），可是，在背叛盟约、反对苏联这一点上，他们是一致的。由于害怕人民的反对，他们不敢公然进行与德寇媾和的谈判，但计划着德寇的秘密投降——不抵抗美、英军队由西战场的“进攻”，让美、英军队比苏联红军先进入德境。于是，我们从电影上看见了这样鲜明的事实：在东战场上，苏军以勇猛的战斗粉碎了纵深五百公里的“铜墙铁壁”的防线和德寇的顽强抵抗，付出了相当的生命和鲜血。而在西战场上，德寇给美、英军队让路，如希姆莱对议员说的那样：“你们军队，可以毫没阻拦的往前边开，我们守备部队准缴枪，甚至派几个骑脚踏车的兵或是喝醉了的没枪的兵到城里来，都能行。”虽然如此，他们还是不能实现恶毒的阴谋。在东战场上艰苦作战的苏军的前进速度是一天三十公里，而西战场上的美、英军队，虽然没有碰到阻拦，但前进速度却是一天十公里。眼见得苏军就要先行进入德境——德国东部了。
    美帝是不甘心于这种情况的。于是，我们看见了进一步的阴谋：美帝大举轰炸东德的工业而保存了在西部的工业，使前者不落于苏联之手，准备攫取后者以准备新的战争——反苏战争。
    今天，美帝正在恢复着西德的军事工业生产，使她成为反苏战争的欧洲兵工厂。然而，当时的阴谋还不止于此呢。和这同时，通过鲍尔曼之手，美帝接受了德寇的巴尔干情报网——在东欧的特务名单，企图利用这些“久经训练，擅长杀人和卖命的人，而主要是他们反对共产的俄国”（鲍尔曼对议员说的）的人，进行反苏的破坏工作。德寇的情报负责人舍林别格尔还帮助着布置特务们在吉兰、布达佩斯、索菲亚、贝尔戈莱德……同美国使节的代表和美国使馆建立关系，指使特务们“混进各部院、部队，混进祖国阵线政府里去，混进共产党领导机关。……第二任务，放火破坏和怠工。把恐怖性活动组织起来……要消灭共产主义的领袖们，要打死那些共产党员们。”舍林别格尔对卡尔维说：“我把承继权交给了您。”这，恰恰意味着希特勒把他的承继权交给了杜鲁门——杜勒斯之辈。今天，后者正拼命的想实现希特勒的妄想！
    这里，我们应该肯定编剧与导演的非凡才力。面对着这样一个事件——一连串的阴谋，他们曾精致的、概括的表现了某几个主要环节，并加以深入的发掘和突出的描写。当他们一层又一层的揭开秘密使节的反苏阴谋的时候，也就一声紧一声的提起了观众的警觉，燃起了观众的愤怒的火焰。我们看见画面上的议员、卡尔维、邱吉尔、万金阔隆、吉伦……等，不仅要唾弃他们的卑鄙无耻，而且要憎恨并且惩罚他们的罪恶。
    在编剧与导演所描绘的另一面，是反对这伙罪犯、反对战争、反对勾结法西斯、反对“反苏”、要求和平的人民的力量。对于这一伙罪犯来说，人民恰如鲍尔曼指出的那样“危险”的。电影所描绘的是：一个“对政治不感兴趣，看报纸爱看体育栏”的美国驾驶员，曾狠狠的一拳把那个议员打倒了，他怀疑议员为什么出现在柏林，他不相信曾给他修理飞机的那些俄国朋友们会是他的敌人。在柏林，就有德国共产党员活动着，防空洞里出现了反战的传单；一九四五年五月九日，不仅是莫斯科，在纽约和伦敦也一样，人民高呼着“世界和平万岁”来庆祝胜利。当邱吉尔们决心发动一次新的战争——反苏战争的时候，他也明白，要人民“不妨碍”他们才行。事实指明，人民是一定要妨碍他们——阻止他们发动新战争的。数以万万计的人民在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名，就是一种有力的“妨碍”！
    “秘密使节”的故事在一片欢呼声中结束了。从伦敦到莫斯科，同样的喊着“斯大林万岁”。这不是偶然的。影片“秘密使节”所揭露的美英帝国主义的反苏阴谋，就将在以万万计的、要求世界和平的、高呼“斯大林万岁”的人民的巨大力量之下被粉碎！
                                  一九五一年一月八日
