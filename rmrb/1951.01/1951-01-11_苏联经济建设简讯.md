Brief News on Soviet Economic Construction

　　After the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic completed its post-war Five-Year Plan, its total industrial output exceeded pre-war levels by more than two and a half times. The rich shale mines have been restored, and are superior to those of the United States and the United Kingdom in terms of equipment. The world's first shale gas production plant has been established. Thousands of workers have become rationalization proposers and inventors. Ninety percent of peasant families have joined collective farms. Estonia has a population of 1.12 million, but in the years after the war, 323 million books have been published.

　　After the Latvian Republic completed its post-war Five-Year Plan, it has become an advanced industrial country. Industrial production has increased sixfold in five years, and the increase in 1950 alone was equivalent to the total output of all enterprises in the republic in 1945. The production of complex machines has increased more than eightfold in five years. Electricity generation, steel, and rolled metal production have all exceeded planned targets. Thousands of Stakhanovite workers have emerged in the republic, greatly increasing labor productivity.

　　The Soviet sugar industry has greatly exceeded the Five-Year Plan. In the past five years, the Soviet Union has not only restored the war-damaged beet fields, but has also opened up many new beet fields and built dozens of new sugar refineries. Sugar production has greatly exceeded the pre-war level of 1940, and it ranks first in the world in terms of sugar production and consumption.

　　Thousands of collective farms across the Soviet Union have completed the three-year plan for developing livestock breeding in two years. The increase in livestock and poultry has reached a speed unprecedented in any country in the world. In 1950, the number of cattle increased by 19 percent, sheep by 15 percent, pigs by 41 percent, and poultry by more than 50 percent. After many collective farms in the Astrakhan region systematically improved livestock breeds, they have been able to shear 7 to 10 kilograms of wool from each sheep. In addition to machine tractor stations, the state has specially established 79 special machine stations to help collective farms implement the mechanization of pasture and grassland work. In the past year, the sown area for feed has increased threefold. Due to outstanding labor achievements, more than 720 livestock breeders were awarded the title of Hero of Socialist Labor last year, and more than 5,000 collective farmers and livestock breeders were awarded government medals.

　　苏联经济建设简讯
    苏联爱沙尼亚共和国执行战后五年计划后，工业总生产量已超过战前水平二倍半以上。丰富的页岩矿已经修复，在设备方面超过了美国和英国。世界上第一所生产页岩煤气的工厂已经建立起来。数以千计的工人已变成合理化建议者和发明者。农民家庭百分之九十已参加了集体农场。爱沙尼亚有人口一百一十二万，但在战后几年已经出版了三亿二千三百万册书籍。
    拉脱维亚共和国完成战后五年计划后，已变为先进的工业国。五年来工业生产量增加了六倍，仅一九五○年的增产量即相当于一九四五年共和国全部企业的总产量。复杂机器的产量五年来增加了八倍以上。发电量、钢、辗金属的生产均已超额完成计划。共和国内已涌现了成千上万的斯塔哈诺夫式工作者，大大提高了劳动生产率。
    苏联制糖工业已大大地超过了五年计划。苏联五年来除已恢复了战争破坏的甜菜园地外，已增辟了许多甜菜田地，新建了数十所炼糖厂。食糖生产大大超过了战前一九四○年的水平，在食糖的生产与消费方面均占世界首位。
    苏联全国已有成千的集体农场在两年内完成了发展牲畜饲养业的三年计划。牲畜和家禽的增加，已达世界上各国从来未有的速度。在一九五○年，牛的头数增加了百分之十九，绵羊增加百分之十五，猪增加百分之四十一，家禽增加了百分之五十以上。阿斯特拉罕州的许多集体农场有系统的改良牲畜品种后，已能在每一头绵羊身上剪下七公斤至十公斤的羊毛。国家在机器拖拉机站之外，特别设立了七十九个特种机器站，帮助集体农场实施牧场和草地工作的机械化，在去年一年内，饲料的播种面积已增加了三倍。由于劳动成绩优异，去年有七百二十多个牲畜饲养者荣膺社会主义劳动英雄称号，五千多名集体农民和牲畜饲养者荣膺政府勋章。
