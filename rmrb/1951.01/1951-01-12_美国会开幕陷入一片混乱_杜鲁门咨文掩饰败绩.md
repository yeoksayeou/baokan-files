　　US Congress Opening Descends into Chaos
　　Truman's Address Conceals Defeats
    [Xinhua News Agency, January 11th] Truman presented his annual “State of the Union Address” to the Congress, which had just opened and immediately descended into chaos, on January 8th. In this customary lengthy address, Truman completely avoided discussing the true state of the United States, the decisive defeats suffered by the US in its war of aggression against Korea, and the serious crisis caused by it.

    In this address, Truman carefully avoided answering Hoover and Taft's sharp attacks on the US government's current aggressive foreign policy. Truman stated that the American aggressor forces were unwilling to withdraw from the Eurasian continent. He said anxiously: If the United States withdraws from Western Europe, "it will double the Soviet Union's coal supply and triple its steel supply"; if the United States withdraws from Asia and Africa, "we will lose many of our most important raw materials – including the source of uranium, which is the basis of our atomic energy". The manpower of various countries in Europe and Asia "will confront us with a force that we have no hope of matching."

    After issuing shameless slanders against the Soviet Union, Truman repeated his old tune and put forward the so-called "action program," namely: first, "economic assistance must be applied where it can be effective"; second, "military assistance must continue to be provided to those countries that want to defend themselves"; third, "efforts will continue to be made to seek peaceful solutions to international disputes." Then, Truman boasted about how "powerful" the US military was and its expansion plans, completely exposing the hypocrisy of his so-called seeking "peaceful solutions." In order to ease the widespread defeatist sentiment at home, Truman asked Congress to pass legislation on ten "major issues," including appropriations for continued military expansion, extending and amending the Selective Service Act, expanding and extending economic control powers, and further increasing the people's tax burden. However, Truman neither proposed nor could propose any new solutions to the various crises caused by the failure of the American aggression policy.

    Although Truman tried to conceal the divisions within the US ruling clique, he used many words at the end of his address to call for "unity." He said: "I ask Congress to unite in this emergency." But then he said timidly: "Please do not misunderstand me, I am not asking or hoping for complete unanimity."

    Truman's address did not ease the chaotic situation within the US ruling clique at all, and was immediately met with severe criticism. Republican Policy Committee Chairman Taft ridiculed Truman's address, saying that he "found nothing in Truman's State of the Union Address to argue with" because "most of it is generalities." Republican Senate Leader Wherry described Truman's address as "shocking and disappointing." Republican Senator Nicholson believed that Truman's address was "not specific enough and insufficient to cope with the serious crisis we face." Republican Senator Jenner even more fiercely criticized Truman's address as playing with "unprecedented American hypocrisy." He said: "The tragedy is that the President of the United States has lured us into such a desperate situation that he dares not tell the American people the truth." Not only that, but after Truman's address was published, even the Democrat who praised him, House Speaker Rayburn, believed that under the current circumstances, this address was "not very powerful."

    The American newspapers' reaction to Truman's address was also indifferent. According to an AFP report from New York on the 9th: "Most newspapers here today treated Truman's speech to Congress yesterday with indifference." The New York Herald Tribune also specifically pointed out that Truman's bankrupt Asian policy was "less clear." The newspaper sarcastically said: "He did not – or perhaps he could not – answer this question."

### 美国会开幕陷入一片混乱  杜鲁门咨文掩饰败绩

　　美国会开幕陷入一片混乱
    杜鲁门咨文掩饰败绩
    【新华社十一日讯】杜鲁门于一月八日向刚刚开幕即陷于一片混乱的国会提出其一年一度的“国情咨文”。在这个照例的冗长的咨文中，杜鲁门对于目前美国真实的国情，对于美国在侵略朝鲜战争中遭受的决定性的失败及其所引起的严重危机，完全避而不谈。
    在这篇咨文中，杜鲁门小心翼翼地避免答复胡佛和塔夫脱对美国政府现行侵略外交政策的尖锐攻击。杜鲁门表示：美国侵略势力并不愿自欧亚大陆撤退。他惶恐地说：假如美国自西欧撤退，“即将使苏联的煤炭供应增加一倍，钢的供应增加二倍”；假如美国自亚洲及非洲撤退，“我们就会丧失我们的最关紧要的许多原料——包括作为我们的原子能之基础的铀——的来源地”。欧亚两洲各国人力，“将使我们面临一个我们决没有希望与之相等的兵力”。
    杜鲁门在对苏联发出无耻的诽谤之后，旧调重弹地提出了所谓“行动纲领”，即：第一，“必须把经济援助施于它能够发生效力的地方”；第二，“必须继续向那些想要保卫自己的国家提供军事援助”；第三，“将继续努力谋取国际争端的和平解决”。接着，杜鲁门即侈言美国军力如何“强大”和扩军计划，完全暴露了他的所谓谋取“和平解决”的虚伪性。为了缓和国内普遍的失败主义的情绪，杜鲁门要求国会在十项“主要问题”上通过立法，其中包括用于继续扩军的拨款、延长及修改兵役法、扩大并延长经济管制权力以及进一步地加重人民的税收负担等。但是，对于美国由于侵略政策的失败而引起的各种危机，杜鲁门没有提出也不可能提出任何新的解决办法。
    杜鲁门尽管力图掩饰美国统治集团内部的纷争，但他在咨文的末尾用了很多的话来呼号“团结”。他说：“我要求国会在这一紧急关头团结起来。”但他接着又怯懦地说：“请不要误解我的意思，我并不要求或希望全体一致。”
    杜鲁门的咨文发表以后，丝毫也没有缓和美国统治集团内部的混乱局面，并立即遭到严酷的攻讦。共和党政策委员会主席塔夫脱在评论杜鲁门的咨文时讥讽地说：他“没有发现杜鲁门的国情咨文中有什么可以争辩的地方”，因为其中“大部分是泛泛的通论”。共和党参院领袖惠利形容杜鲁门的咨文“令人震惊和失望”。共和党参议员尼可逊认为：杜鲁门的咨文“不够具体、并且不足以应付我们面对的严重危机”。共和党参议员真纳更猛烈地抨击杜鲁门的咨文是在耍弄“美国史无前例的伪善手段”。他说：“悲剧是美国总统已把我们诱入这样的绝境，以至他不敢把真相告诉美国人民。”不仅如此，当杜鲁门的咨文发表之后，就是为他吹捧的民主党人、众院议长雷朋，也认为在目前的情况下，这个咨文“并不太强有力”。
    美国报纸对杜鲁门咨文的反应也很淡漠。据法新社纽约九日电称：“此间今日大多数报纸以冷淡的态度对待杜鲁门昨天对国会的演说。”纽约先驱论坛报还特别指出：杜鲁门对他的破产了的亚洲政策“说得比较欠明确”。该报讽刺地说：“他并未——或许他不能——答复这个问题。”
