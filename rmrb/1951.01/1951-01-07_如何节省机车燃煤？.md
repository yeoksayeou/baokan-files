How to Save Locomotive Coal?
    Chen Ji

　　Before embarking on a trip, the crew members of the "Mao Zedong" locomotive all signed a guarantee at the Fengtai Locomotive Depot, promising: "Resolutely save at least 10% of coal!" They also resolved to strive to save 15% of coal in 1951. Why work so hard to save coal? Li Yong, the glorious former driver, said: "In the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, we must work harder, save more coal, and increase our strength to strike at the American bandits." Saving locomotive coal is extremely important: the nation's railway coal consumption accounts for about 20% of the nation's coal production; the nation's locomotive coal consumption accounts for more than 90% of the nation's railway coal consumption; railway coal consumption accounts for about 18% of the railway's total budget. Currently, if the nation's locomotive coal consumption is reduced by just 1% in a year, it can save the People's Railways 6 billion RMB. From this, it can be seen that saving coal means increasing the country's financial resources and creating conditions for the development of railways, which is a problem that must be paid attention to in establishing an economic accounting system in the railway system.

　　Based on existing conditions, can coal be saved? Yes, it can. In the upsurge of the patriotic production competition movement enthusiastically carried out by railway workers across the country, many crew members have put forward the slogan of saving coal, and some have already achieved great results. National model locomotives often save more than 10% of coal. The Linkou Locomotive Depot saved a total of more than 330 tons of coal in October and November of last year. They guaranteed to save another 180 tons of coal in December. The "No. 239" locomotive in Zhengjiatun, Northeast China, saved a total of 166 tons of coal in three months, earning the glorious title of "Coal Saving King." The Guilin Locomotive Depot, which was liberated later, also saved more than 220 tons of coal in October last year, and is moving towards the goal of "saving 30% of coal." These facts show that saving coal is not only possible, but also that the amount of coal saved will not be small. This year, the Ministry of Railways' planned coal consumption reduction can be achieved.

　　Since saving coal is very important and very possible, how can coal be saved? Li Yong's answer is: "Give full play to the sense of responsibility as masters." The liberated Chinese working class has become the master of the country and the master of the locomotive. The master of the locomotive should take good care of the locomotive and be fully responsible for every job of the locomotive. Saving coal is the result of the crew's complete responsibility for the locomotive and a concrete manifestation of the Chinese working class's sense of ownership.

　　I have visited the crew members of the "Mao Zedong" locomotive, the "Iron Ox" locomotive, and the "No. 1195" locomotive. The "Mao Zedong" was the first to implement the Soviet advanced experience – the crew responsibility system, the "Iron Ox" was the pioneer of the Iron Ox movement on the Northeast Railway, and the "No. 1195" was the standard-bearer of the 500-kilometer movement on the Northeast Railway. They are all the best typical locomotives in the country. Their crew members once talked to me about how to save coal. These methods are by no means purely technical, but a great patriotic expression of serving the motherland wholeheartedly.

　　To save coal, the driver must master the operating techniques well, that is, he must drive responsibly. When driving, he must pay attention to the slopes at all times and be familiar with the slope conditions. When going uphill, he must tell the fireman to burn more steam so that there is enough steam power to push the train uphill; when going downhill, he must also contact the fireman to burn less steam so that the locomotive can use inertia, use less steam, and save fuel. When the train is about to enter the station, the driver must also close the steam valve and use the inertia of forward movement; only after the locomotive enters the station does he pull the brake to stop the train. As long as the driver pays attention to saving steam without slowing down the train during operation, the locomotive can save coal. The fireman's job is to burn fire. The key to saving coal is mostly in his hands. He must "add coal frequently and add water frequently." Frequent coal addition means resolutely implementing the three-shovel system. Experience has proven that frequent coal addition, only three shovels at a time, can make the coal burn completely, the fire is strong, and the steam power is enhanced; on the contrary, some lazy firemen add a lot of coal at once, so the coal is pressed on the fire bed, the fire cannot burn through the coal, the fire is weak, and steam cannot be burned; and this method of adding coal takes a long time, and cold air easily invades the furnace, damaging the boiler. Implementing the three-shovel system is an important factor in saving coal and a manifestation of responsibility. Some model locomotive firemen can maintain sufficient steam power by adding two shovels, which saves even more coal. The implementation of the three-shovel system is not mechanical, but must be based on the actual situation to save coal as much as possible. A few locomotives have the saying and practice of "big three shovels, small three shovels; tight three shovels, slow three shovels," the purpose of which is to save fuel. In addition, the fireman must add water frequently according to the prescribed standards. If too much water is added, it wastes coal and is not easy to burn into steam; if too little is added, the steam power is small; if it is added slowly and frequently, this phenomenon will not occur. Driving and firing must be responsible to the end to save fuel. The owner of a locomotive must also pay attention to the maintenance of the locomotive itself. The crew members of the "Iron Ox" locomotive maintain the locomotive like nurses taking care of patients, checking the locomotive parts at any time, carefully wiping the car, and lubricating it well to maintain the locomotive in good condition, so the "Iron Ox" locomotive can often save more than 10% of coal. A poor-quality locomotive will not only fail to save coal, but will also cause accidents and cause huge losses. Therefore, improving the quality of locomotives should be a prerequisite for saving coal.

　　Li Yong often says: "Everything must be done with everyone's concerted efforts to succeed." Similarly, to save coal, everyone must save it. It is not enough to just rely on the locomotive crew. When factories repair locomotives, they must repair the locomotive's moving parts well. For example, if the cylinders and steam chambers are repaired well, there will be no steam leakage, avoiding fuel waste. Also, cleaning the furnace and washing the tank cannot be ignored. The boiler is full of scale, which increases the thickness of the boiler, making it most difficult to heat and most fuel-consuming. Reducing scale is an indispensable task. The Ministry of Railways has started soft water work to solve the problem of hard water scale; however, the current tank washing work should still be strengthened. It is also an important task to properly store the accumulated fuel. Poor storage will cause the fuel to lose its calorific value and waste a lot of fuel. It is also extremely important for the engineering department to repair the lines well, eliminate slow speeds, and reduce the possibility of stops for saving coal. It should be known that one stop wastes 150 kg to 200 kg of fuel. Conscientiously carrying out the super-axle movement and the 500-kilometer movement will bring more brilliant achievements to coal saving. As long as everyone truly values saving coal ideologically and fully gives play to their sense of responsibility as masters, coal saving figures will continue to emerge, and the People's Railways will develop more soundly. Of course, while striving to exert subjective forces, we must not ignore the technical work in terms of fuel. Whenever possible, it is also necessary to vigorously improve thermal technology work, which will lead coal saving work to a higher stage.

　　如何节省机车燃煤？
    陈迹
    “毛泽东号”机车的乘务员们出乘之前，都在丰台机务段立下保证书，保证书上写着：“坚决省煤百分之十以上！”他们还决心要在一九五一年争取省煤百分之十五。为什么要这样努力省煤呢？光荣的前司机长李永说：“在抗美援朝斗争中，我们更要卖力气，更要多节省煤炭，增加打击美国强盗的力量。”节省机车燃煤是极其重要的：全国铁路的用煤量，约占全国的煤产量百分之二十左右；全国机车用煤量占全国铁路用煤量的百分之九十以上；铁路用煤，约占铁路全部预算的百分之十八。现在全国机车的用煤量一年之内只要节省百分之一，就可以给人民铁道节省人民币六十亿元。由此可见，省煤就是给国家增加财力，为发展铁路创造条件，也就是铁路系统中建立经济核算制的一项必须注意的问题。
    依据现有条件，能不能省煤呢？能够的。在全国铁路工人热烈开展爱国主义生产竞赛运动的热潮里，不少的乘务员都提出了省煤的口号，有些已经得到了很大的成绩。全国模范机车经常省煤百分之十以上。林口机务段在去年十月和十一月两月共省煤三百三十多吨。他们保证在十二月份再省煤一百八十吨。东北郑家屯“二三九号”机车在三个月内共省煤一百六十六吨，获得“省煤大王”的光荣称号。解放较晚的桂林机务段去年十月份也省煤二百二十多吨，并向“省煤百分之三十”的目标迈进。这些事实说明了省煤不仅可能，而且省煤数量不会很小。今年铁道部计划用煤量减少，是可以做到的。
    既然省煤是很重要而且很可能的，那么怎样才能省煤呢？李永的答复是：“充分发挥主人翁的责任感。”解放了的中国工人阶级成了国家的主人，也成了机车的主人，机车的主人就应当很好地爱护机车，对机车的每一工作负责到底。省煤就是乘务员对机车彻底负责的结果，就是中国工人阶级的主人翁思想的具体表现。
    我访问过“毛泽东号”机车、“铁牛号”机车和“一一九五号”机车的乘务员。“毛泽东号”是苏联先进经验——乘务负责制的首先实行者，“铁牛号”是东北铁路铁牛运动的首创者，“一一九五号”是东北铁路五百公里运动的旗手，它们都是全国最好的典型机车，它们的乘务员曾经和我谈到怎样才能省煤的方法，这些方法决不是什么单纯的技术，而是一种全心全意为祖国服务的伟大爱国主义的表现。
    省煤，就得要求司机好好掌握操纵技术，就是说，必须负责地开车。开车的时候，他要时时刻刻注意坡道，熟悉坡道的情况。上坡道时，他要告诉司炉，多烧汽，以便有足够的汽力，推动火车上坡；下坡时，他又要联络司炉，少烧汽，以便机车利用惰力，少费汽，节省燃煤。列车快要进站时，司机也得关上汽门，利用前进的惰力；等机车进了站，才拉闸，使车停止。只要司机在操纵时，注意省汽而不让车走慢，这样就可以使机车省了煤。司炉做的是烧火工作，省煤与否的关键，大部分掌握在他手里，他必须要“勤上煤，勤上水”。勤上煤就是坚决实行三锹制，经验证明：勤上煤，每次只上三锹，能使煤全部燃烧，火力旺盛，增强汽力；相反的，有些偷懒的司炉，一次上很多煤，这样煤就压在火床上面，火烧不透煤，火力弱，烧不上汽；而且这样的上煤法，时间又长，冷气易于侵入火炉，损害锅炉。实行三锹制是省煤的重要因素，也是负责的表现。有些模范机车的司炉上二锹，能保持充足的汽力，那就更省煤了。执行三锹制也不是机械的，要根据实际情况，尽可能地做到省煤。少数机车有“大三锹，小三锹；紧三锹，慢三锹”的说法和作法，其目的都是为了节省燃煤。此外，司炉还要按照规定的标准，勤上水，水上多了，费煤，不易烧成汽；上少了，汽力又小；如果慢慢上，勤上，就不会有这种现象了。开车和烧火，都要负责任到底，才能节约燃料。一个机车的主人，对于机车本身的保养也要注意。“铁牛号”机车乘务员保养机车象护士照顾病人一样，随时随地检查机车零件，仔细擦车，好好给油，保持机车良好状态，所以“铁牛号”机车能经常省煤百分之十以上。一个质量差的机车，不仅省不了煤，而且会发生事故，造成巨大的损失。因此，提高机车质量，应当是省煤的先决条件。
    李永常常说：“什么事儿都得大伙儿齐心干，才能成功。”同样地，要省煤，就要大伙儿来省，光是机车乘务员是不顶事的。工厂修理机车，一定要修好机车的行动部门，例如修好了汽缸和汽室，就不会漏汽，避免燃煤的浪费。还有清炉和洗罐，也不能忽视。锅炉里积满了水锈，使锅炉厚度增加，最不易烧热，最费煤。减少水锈，是决不可少的工作。铁道部已着手于软水工作，解决硬水水锈的问题；然而目前的洗罐工作仍应加强。很好地保管积存的燃煤，也是一个重要工作。保管不善，将使燃煤消失发热量，大量浪费燃煤。工务部门修好线路，消灭徐行，减少停车的可能，对于省煤亦极重要。要知道：停一次车，就要浪费燃煤一百五十公斤至二百公斤。认真开展超轴运动和五百公里运动，将给省煤带来更辉煌的成绩。只要每个人在思想上真真地重视省煤，充分发挥主人翁的责任感，省煤的数字就会不断地涌现出来，人民铁道就会更健全地发展起来。当然，在努力于发挥主观力量的同时，也不能忽视燃煤方面的技术工作。只要有可能，大力改进热力技术工作也是必要的，它将把省煤工作引向更高的阶段。
