　　Instructions from the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government on Inspecting Disaster Relief Work

　　I. Last year, the country generally had a bumper harvest, but the Huai River region and northeastern Hebei Province suffered severe disasters, and some other provinces experienced partial disasters. The disaster areas have made progress in self-salvation through production, which has alleviated the disaster situation. However, if efforts are not tightened, major problems may still occur. If partial disaster areas are neglected, they may turn into severe disasters. As the winter famine has not yet passed and the spring famine is approaching, governments at all levels should pay attention to inspecting this work, especially the provincial people's governments, administrative offices, and special commissioner's offices, which should quickly arrange this inspection.

　　II. Governments at all levels in disaster areas must accurately grasp the disaster situation and the possible changes in the disaster situation. Provinces should conduct key inspections, while special districts and counties should conduct comprehensive inspections. Senior cadres going deep into disaster areas not only gain more understanding, discover methods, and propose solutions, but also provide great encouragement to districts, townships, and the masses.

　　III. Experience has shown that the success of disaster relief cannot solely rely on the amount of relief grain; the important thing is to do a good job. Many areas have turned the grain distribution process into a production organization process. They say, "The people have so many methods! Even in severely affected areas, villages have no idle people and families have savings." Other areas simply rely on relief grain and are not good at turning relief grain into production capital. Although they also promote production, they are not good at leveraging the diverse production capabilities of the people according to local conditions and time, thus failing to achieve or fully achieve the goal of self-salvation through production. All disaster areas should pay special attention to inspecting this point. In addition to specifically leading self-salvation through production, social mutual assistance should be mobilized, and bumper harvest areas should raise some grain for relief. At the same time, the lending relationship among the people should be activated, and attention should be paid early. Do not rely solely on relief grain.

　　IV. Plant more early-maturing crops and spring vegetables. Pay attention to conservation. Introduce the experience of various places in preparing for famine. Severely affected areas should strengthen ditch and drainage work to ensure the wheat harvest.

　　V. The families of revolutionary martyrs, revolutionary soldiers, revolutionary workers, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized soldiers in disaster areas should receive good care.

　　VI. Disaster relief work is a matter of life and death for many people. "Do not let anyone starve to death" is the responsible attitude that should be taken for disaster relief. Have confidence in this slogan and let it take root in the actions of the masses. Governments at all levels must conduct regular inspections, commend those who do well and encourage others to emulate them, and reward them. Those who do poorly should be asked to make self-criticisms, and those who do very poorly should be punished.

　　VII. Last year, governments at all levels attached importance to disaster relief work and overcame severe disasters. In the future, disaster relief and prevention work should become a regular government work system. All civil affairs departments, under the leadership of the production and disaster relief committees of their respective people's governments, should regularly study the central government's instructions and documents on disaster relief and prevention work, and ensure that this work receives the regular cooperation of all relevant departments to solve specific problems at any time.

　　The above points must be earnestly implemented. The results of implementation and the dynamics of various disaster relief work are to be reported to the Ministry at any time.

### 中央人民政府内务部  关于检查救灾工作的指示

    关于检查救灾工作的指示
    一、去年全国一般是丰收，但沿淮河地区及河北省东北部有重灾，其他一些省有偏灾。重灾区生产自救有成绩，已使灾势减轻，但如抓的不紧，仍可能发生大问题，偏灾区如忽视，也可能转为重灾。在这冬荒未过，春荒又要到来的时候，各级人民政府应注意这方面工作的检查，特别是省人民政府、行署、专署应迅速布置这一检查。
    二、有灾地区的各级人民政府要确实掌握灾情及灾情可能发生的变化。省要有重点地查，专、县要普遍的查。高级干部深入灾区，不仅是了解多，能发现办法，提出办法，并对区乡与群众是一个很大的鼓舞。
    三、经验证明：救灾成绩好坏，不能单纯依赖救济粮的多少，重要在于工作做得好。不少地区把发粮过程成为组织生产过程。他们说：“老百姓的办法真多！就是重灾区，也做到村无闲人家有储蓄了。”另外一些地区单纯依赖救济粮，而不善于把救济粮变成生产资本，虽然也提倡生产，但不善于因地因时发挥人民多种多样的生产力量，因此达不到或不能完全达到生产自救的目的。各灾区应特别注意检查这一点。除具体领导生产自救外，应发动社会互济，丰收区募集些粮食去救。同时应活跃人民间的借贷关系，要注意得早。不要专指望救济粮。
    四、多种早熟作物与春菜。注意节约。介绍各地备荒经验。重灾区要加强沟洫工作，保证麦收。
    五、灾区的革命烈士家属、革命军人家属、革命工作人员家属与革命残废军人、复员军人，应受到很好的照顾。
    六、救灾工作是关系多少人生死的问题。“不要饿死一个人”是救灾负责的应有态度。对这一口号要有信心，要把它生根到群众的行动中去。各级人民政府必须经常检查，做得好的通报，到处仿效，并予以奖励，不好的要他检讨，很不好的给予处分。
    七、去年各级人民政府对救灾工作均重视，战胜了严重的灾荒，今后在于使救灾防灾工作成为政府的经常工作制度，所有民政部门在各该人民政府生产救灾委员会领导下，应经常注意研究中央关于救灾防灾工作的指示文件，并使这一工作得到各有关部门的经常配合，随时解决具体问题。
    以上各点，要切实执行，执行结果及各种救灾工作动态，望随时报部。
