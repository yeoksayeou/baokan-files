Xinhua News Agency, January 1st -- The Chinese People's Liberation Army's All-Army Propaganda, Education, and Cultural Work Conference, which began in Beijing on December 17, 1950, concluded successfully after lasting half a month. The conference discussed and determined the guidelines and tasks for the all-army propaganda, education, and cultural work in 1951, and discussed and resolved various major specific business issues.

During the conference, Zhu De, Vice Chairman of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission and Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and Liu Shaoqi, Vice Chairman of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission, attended and delivered speeches, providing clear instructions on the basic guidelines for the army's propaganda, education, and cultural work. Xiao Hua, Deputy Director of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, delivered a report on the basic guidelines and tasks of political education in the army in 1951, based on the above instructions. Chen Yi, Minister of the Cultural Department of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, delivered a report on the army's literary and artistic work. All the delegates fully discussed the above reports and various major specific business issues. Finally, Fu Zhong, Deputy Director of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, summarized the various issues discussed at the conference.

The conference determined that the basic guideline for political education in the army in 1951 is to strengthen patriotic and internationalist education, centered on opposing American imperialist aggression, defending the motherland, and defending peace in East Asia and the world, on the basis of strengthening class education. The aim is to encourage the fighting will and confidence in victory of the troops, promote revolutionary heroism and all excellent traditional work styles, build a strong and modernized national defense force, and be ready at any time to crush any aggressive conspiracy of American imperialism.

The conference emphasized that cadre political education occupies a primary position in the entire political education. In order to build a strong, modernized national defense force, it is first necessary to improve the ideological and political level of cadres. Cadres must systematically receive education in Marxism-Leninism theory and Mao Zedong Thought. This is the basic link in cadre education. The conference also pointed out that cadres should be organized into different classes according to their different political and theoretical levels, breaking the concept of position in cadre learning, and advocating an honest and humble attitude towards learning.

The conference determined that the basic guideline for the army's literary and artistic work is to continue to delve deeply into the life of the troops, improve the level of creation, and more closely combine the literary and artistic activities of the broad masses of soldiers with the literary and artistic activities of cultural work troupes and writers, vigorously carry out the creation movement, and improve the literary and artistic work of the People's Liberation Army. The conference also pointed out that cultural and recreational activities in companies are one of the excellent traditions of our army, and should be firmly maintained and developed. In the future, our army will further become a modern national defense force with a high degree of culture and science, and therefore cultural construction is even more important, and a high degree of cultural life in companies is also an indispensable component. Cultural and recreational life in companies should become the focus of the army's cultural construction. The conference requested that leading organs at all levels and all army literary and artistic workers should deeply recognize the importance of this work ideologically, and vigorously carry out this work on the existing basis.

The conference discussed and drafted the implementation plan for cultural education in the army, and determined that cultural education should follow the guidelines of being rapid, connected to reality, but also regular. The conference pointed out that under the current situation, it is not yet possible for the entire army to conduct large-scale cultural education, but it should be recognized that improving the cultural level of the troops is of great significance to improving the military and political level of the troops. The entire army must implement the spirit of the "Instructions on Launching Cultural and Educational Work in the Troops" issued by the People's Revolutionary Military Commission on August 1, 1950, and take possible methods suitable for the new situation to implement the cultural education of the troops in a practical, planned, and organized manner.
