　　Avenge the Dead in Andong

　　American planes bombed Andong City in Northeast China on New Year's Eve, killing and wounding 58 of our compatriots. All Chinese people are extremely indignant at this barbaric act of aggression by American imperialism.

　　Andong City is the sacred territory of the People's Republic of China. American planes, disregarding China's sovereignty and the inviolable dignity of the Chinese people, have once again brazenly provoked the Chinese people, exposing the ugly face of America as the enemy of the Chinese people.

　　The United States has already failed in Korea and is heading towards its final defeat. However, even in the face of inevitable defeat, it continues to bomb China's border strongholds and infringe upon the Chinese people. This shows that only by winning a complete victory in the war to resist America and aid Korea can we guarantee peace on the Northeast border.

　　American imperialists have incurred a new blood debt to the Chinese people, and the Chinese people must avenge the dead compatriots! Strengthening national defense and intensifying support for the Chinese People's Volunteers to Resist America and Aid Korea! This is the most effective way for the Chinese people to oppose American aggression and defend peace today.

　　为安东死难者复仇
    美国飞机除夕轰炸我东北的安东市，死伤我同胞五十八人。全中国人民对美帝国主义这种横蛮的侵略行为，万分愤慨。
    安东市是中华人民共和国神圣的国土，美国飞机竟又一次不顾中国主权，不顾中国人民不可侵犯的尊严，肆无忌惮地向中国人民挑衅，这就又一次暴露出美国是中国人民的公敌的丑恶面目。
    美国在朝鲜已经失败，并且正在走向最后的失败。然而，在败局已定的情况下，它仍然轰炸中国的边防重地，侵犯中国的人民，这说明，只有争取在朝鲜的抗美战争的完全胜利，才能保障东北国境的和平。
    美帝国主义者又欠下了中国人民一笔新的血债，中国人民必须为死难的同胞报仇！加强国防，加紧支持抗美援朝志愿军！就是中国人民今天反对美国侵略保卫和平的最有效的方法。
