　　Shanxi Machine Company Successfully Trials Tractor
    This is the first product from inside the customs, and it has been named "Resist America, Aid Korea."
    [Xinhua News Agency, 21st Dispatch] The Shanxi Provincial Machine Company has successfully trial-produced a tractor. This is the first product from machinery manufacturing within the customs in our country. After this tractor was made on December 17th of last year, it was test-driven for ten kilometers, and the effect was very good. It has been named "Resist America, Aid Korea" and is now on display at the Shanxi Industrial and Agricultural Exhibition. This tractor has 25 horsepower, is track-type, and is most suitable for loose soil, wet soil, and slopes, and occupies a smaller area when turning. It drags two bottom plows and can cultivate ten mu per hour.
    The Shanxi Machine Company was originally Yan Xishan’s military factory. After liberation, it was converted to peaceful industry, mainly manufacturing production tools for farmers. In the process of trial-producing the tractor, all employees overcame many difficulties due to insufficient equipment, and all more than five thousand parts, except for a few, were self-made.

　　山西机器公司试制拖拉机成功
    这是关内第一部产品，已被命名为“抗美援朝号”。
    【新华社二十一日讯】山西省机器公司试制拖拉机成功。这是我国关内各地机器制造业中的第一部产品。这部拖拉机在去年十二月十七日制成后，曾试开十公里，效果很好。它已被命名为“抗美援朝号”，现在停放在山西工农业展览会里进行展览。这部拖拉机有二十五匹马力，是链轨式，在松土、湿土和坡地上最合用，而且转弯时所占地位较小。它拖带两底犁一台，每小时能耕十市亩。
    山西机器公司原为阎匪锡山的军火工厂，解放后转为和平工业，主要为农民制造生产工具。在试制拖拉机过程中，全体职工克服许多设备不足的困难，全部五千多个零件除个别外都是自制的。
