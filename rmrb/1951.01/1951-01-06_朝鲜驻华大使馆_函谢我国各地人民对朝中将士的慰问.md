　　Korean Embassy in China
　　Sends Letter Thanking People Across China for Condolences to Korean and Chinese Soldiers
　　[Our Newspaper's Report] The Korean Embassy in China sent a letter to the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression on December 27th of last year, expressing gratitude for the letters of condolences from all walks of life across China to the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. The original letter is as follows:
　　We have received all the letters of condolence from various places and circles forwarded by your committee. We express our utmost gratitude. Those letters have already been forwarded.
　　Currently, our just anti-aggression war is still continuing in Korea. After the great Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the heroic Korean People's Army launched a large-scale counter-offensive, they have continuously achieved important victories, dealing decisive blows to the enemy. The bandit group headed by U.S. imperialism has already begun to worry and panic. In particular, the enthusiastic Resist-America, Aid-Korea movement of the entire Chinese people has made the enemy tremble there.
　　We believe that your enthusiastic condolences will certainly further encourage and inspire the Chinese and Korean soldiers on the front lines and the entire Korean people to defeat the remaining enemies more vigorously and confidently, and defend our motherland and people.
　　May the people of our two countries, Korea and China, unite more closely and fight to the end for the security of our motherlands and for the peace of our Asia!
　　Sincerely yours,
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression

　　朝鲜驻华大使馆
    函谢我国各地人民对朝中将士的慰问
    【本报讯】朝鲜驻华大使馆于去年十二月二十七日致函中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会，感激我国各地各界写信慰问朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军。原信如下：
    贵会所转来的各地各界的慰问信全已如数收到。我们表示十二万分的感激。那些信业已转去了。
    现在我们的正义的反侵略战争还在朝鲜继续着，伟大的中国人民志愿部队与英勇的朝鲜人民军开始大规模的反攻以后，不断地获得了重要的胜利，已给敌人以决定性的打击。以美帝为首的强盗集团已经开始忧虑恐慌，尤其是全中国人民热烈的抗美援朝行动，已使敌人在那里发抖。
    我们相信，你们这样的热情慰问，一定能够更加鼓舞和激励前线的中朝战士和全体朝鲜人民，更加劲地更有信心地击溃残敌，保卫我们的祖国和人民。
    愿我朝中两国人民更加紧密团结，为争取我们祖国的安全、为争取我们亚洲的和平而共同奋斗到底！
    此致
                     中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会
                                 朝鲜驻华大使馆
