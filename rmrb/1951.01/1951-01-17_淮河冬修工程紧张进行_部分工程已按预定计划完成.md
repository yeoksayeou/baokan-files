Xinhua News Agency, Bengbu, January 15th: The first winter project for fundamentally harnessing the Huai River is being intensified, with some projects already completed according to the predetermined plan.

Since mid-November of last year, over 700,000 migrant workers from the three provinces along the Huai River—Henan, northern Anhui, and northern Jiangsu—have successively gone to the embankment. The people on both banks of the Huai River, who have long been in disaster, have enthusiastically joined the ranks of the Huai River harnessing army with fiery enthusiasm and have displayed a high degree of initiative in their labor. They often work early and late, and some persist in working even in wind and snow. Some even disregard the severe cold and jump into the thin ice-covered mud to extract soil and drain water. After Zhu Huaibin's migrant worker team from Jingtou District, Wuhe County, northern Anhui, went to the embankment, they consistently maintained a high level of labor efficiency. The team averaged nearly three cubic meters of earth excavated per person per day (the general achievement is about two cubic meters). In Yingshang County, the county's migrant workers had a maximum earth excavation efficiency of 4.7 cubic meters per person per day, and a minimum of 2.1 cubic meters. The Wuhe County rammer workers even created a method of using stone rollers, which increased the working efficiency of the rammer workers by two times compared to the original use of stone slabs. The embankments compacted by the rollers are also more solid than before.

Due to the high degree of initiative and creativity displayed by the migrant workers in their work, the progress of the project is quite rapid. The 600,000 migrant workers in northern Anhui, in the middle reaches of the Huai River, are undertaking the reconstruction of embankments, dredging, and other projects, with a daily progress of 1.2 million cubic meters. Many areas have therefore completed their tasks ahead of schedule. The earthwork for the flood storage projects in the low-lying areas of Laowangpo and Wu Songhu in Henan Province, in the upper reaches of the Huai River, has now been completed; the flood storage projects in the low-lying areas of Jiaoting Lake and Tong Lake have also completed the predetermined winter repair plan. The dike repair project on the Grand Canal in northern Jiangsu is also proceeding according to the predetermined plan.

During the winter project of harnessing the Huai River, a large number of political workers participating in the Huai River harnessing have gone deep into various construction sites to carry out propaganda and mobilization work for the migrant workers through blackboard newspapers, broadcasts, dramas, and newspaper reading groups, greatly encouraging the labor enthusiasm of the migrant workers. The staff in charge of transportation and supply used various means of transportation day and night, regardless of rain or snow, to deliver grain and coal to the construction site on time. Cooperatives in some areas have set up branches near the construction site to supply the migrant workers on the embankment with daily necessities such as oil and salt. The above measures have played a significant role in ensuring the smooth progress of the Huai River harnessing project.

The first winter project for fundamentally harnessing the Huai River is the prelude to the massive project of fundamentally harnessing the Huai River. At present, the winter project of harnessing the Huai River is about to end, and the Huai River Harnessing Committee is preparing to conduct a summary after the completion and formulate the project plan for this spring.

　　淮河冬修工程紧张进行
    部分工程已按预定计划完成
    【新华社蚌埠十五日电】根治淮河的第一个冬季工程正在加紧进行，其中部分工程已按预定计划完成。
    自去年十一月中旬以来，河南、皖北、苏北三个沿淮河省区先后上堤的民工已达七十多万人。长期处于灾难之中的淮河两岸的人民，都以火热的心情踊跃投入治淮大军的行列，并在劳动中发挥了高度的积极性。他们经常起早带晚地赶工，有的在风雪交加中仍然坚持工作。有的甚至不顾酷冷，跳到结着薄冰的稀泥里取土排水。皖北五河县井头区朱怀斌民工班上堤后，始终保持着高度的劳动效率。该班平均每人每天挖土近三公方（一般成绩是两公方左右）。颍上县全县民工每人每天挖土效率最高的达四点七公方，最低的也达二点一公方。五河县硪工更创造了使用石磙硪的办法，使硪工工作效率较原来使用石片硪时提高了两倍，经磙硪压实的堤防也较前更加牢固。
    由于民工们在工作中发挥了高度的积极性与创造性，工程的进展相当迅速。淮河中游皖北境内六十万民工进行的复堤、疏浚等工程，每日进程达一百二十万公方。不少地区因而提前完工。淮河上游河南省老王坡、吴宋湖两处洼地蓄洪工程的土工现已完成；蛟停湖、童湖两处的洼地蓄洪工程也已完成了冬修的预定计划。苏北运河河堤的培修工程，亦正按预定计划进行。
    在治淮冬季工程进行期中，参加治淮的大批政治工作人员均分别深入到各工地，运用黑板报、广播、戏剧和读报组等方式，进行对民工的宣传鼓动工作，大大鼓励了民工的劳动热情。负责运输供应的工作人员不分昼夜，不避雨雪地使用各种交通工具按时将粮、煤送到工地。有些地区的合作社特在工地附近设立分社，供给上堤民工所需的油、盐等日用物资。以上措施对保证治淮工程的顺利进行，起了重大的作用。
    根治淮河的第一个冬季工程，是根治淮河巨大工程的序幕。目前，治淮冬季工程即将结束，治淮委员会正准备在完工后进行总结，并制订今春的工程计划。
