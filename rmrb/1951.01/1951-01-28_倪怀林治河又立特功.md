To the Editor:

    Ni Huailin, a model worker in water management from Yancheng, Northern Jiangsu, and a representative attending the National Congress of Labor Models of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers, has once again played a model role in the work of managing the Xi Chao River since returning from Beijing. Ni Huailin is an excellent propagandist. After receiving the notice to participate in the management of the Xi Chao River, he mobilized Party and League members to conduct propaganda separately, inspiring the local masses to express the suffering this river had caused them, so that everyone actively demanded river management. After Ni Huailin took the lead in signing up to participate in river management, fifty-seven farmers immediately followed him and signed up automatically (later forty-two people went to participate in river management, and the remaining fifteen stayed in the village to engage in production). On the second day after arriving at the construction site, the Ni Huailin team, through democratic means, formulated a patriotic digging competition plan and challenged all the engineering teams along the river. The one hundred and thirty-five teams of the Pan and Huang River management brigades, under the influence of the Ni Huailin team, first formulated engineering plans, and the brigades selected representatives to learn excavation techniques from the Ni Huailin team. In this way, the Ni Huailin team influenced the huge project of nearly 100,000 people.

    Ni Huailin loves his team members and is willing to study river digging techniques diligently. Therefore, this team was the first to complete the task of digging one thousand nine hundred and eighty cubic meters of earth in ten and a half days. The project fully met the standards and was completed ten days ahead of schedule. In addition, they also helped another company complete the project of digging five hundred cubic meters of earth. The Ni Huailin team was rated as the first-class model team of the entire general team, and Ni Huailin personally was rated as a special-class meritorious worker (currently, approval is being requested from higher authorities).

　　倪怀林治河又立特功编辑同志：
    出席全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议代表，苏北盐城治水模范倪怀林，从北京回来后，又在治理西潮河的工作中发挥了模范作用。倪怀林是一个很好的宣传员。当他接到参加治理西潮河的通知后，他就发动党、团员们分头去作宣传，启发当地群众倾诉这条河给他们的苦难，使大家都积极要求治河。倪怀林领头报名参加治河之后，马上就有五十七个农民（后来去参加治河的有四十二人，其余十五人留在本村搞生产），跟着他自动报名参加。到达工程地点的第二天，倪怀林小组经过民主方式订下了爱国主义挖河竞赛计划，并向全河各个工程小组提出了挑战。潘黄两个治河大队的一百三十五个小组首先在倪怀林小组影响下订出了工程计划，各大队并选出代表到倪怀林小组学习挑挖技术。这样，倪怀林小组就影响了将近十万人的巨大工程。
    倪怀林热爱他的组员，他又肯用心研究挖河的技术。因此，这个小组在十天半的时间内第一个完成了一千九百八十方土的任务。工程完全合乎标准，并提早时间十天。此外并帮助另一中队完成了五百方土的工程。倪怀林小组被评为全总队的一等模范组，倪怀林个人被评为特等功臣（现已报请上级批准中）。
