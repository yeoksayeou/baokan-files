Reading Group Communication

　　A Reading Group in a Mountain Village
　　Jiangxi Yichun Xintian Village Reading Group Huang Xuguang
　　Our rural reading group was established under the instruction of the Xintian District Government by the Xintian Elementary School, which invited us, the intellectuals in the village, to jointly prepare for it. We are located in a remote mountain village with inconvenient transportation and cultural backwardness. When the reading group was first established in March of the lunar calendar in 1950, very few people listened to the readings, only five or six people each time, sometimes even two or three. Moreover, their starting point was not to read newspapers and study current affairs, but mostly to rest and chat after labor. However, due to our patient explanation of current affairs, and based on the newspapers, publicizing various policies in connection with the actual life of the masses, and through the process of going deep into the masses to persuade and mobilize, our reading group alone has developed to twenty regular listeners. And they all realize that listening to the news is beneficial to them. After half a year of study in the reading group, their political understanding and class consciousness have been significantly improved. Regarding the world situation, the general public has the conviction that "the American imperialist aggressors will be defeated, and the peace-loving people will win." Currently, we are carrying out the great land reform work here, which is the beginning of the great happy event for farmers in thousands of years. Our reading group focuses on publicizing current affairs and land policies, and systematically exposes the rumors of bad elements to cooperate with the land reform work and the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement.
　　Before July 1950, our Xintian Village reading group was divided into four reading groups: Qiaoshang Street, Qiaoxia Street, Hedong Street, and our Jiaoliaoxia, all under the leadership of Xintian Elementary School. On July 25th, the school held a reading group work meeting. It was decided to combine the upper and lower streets into a central group. Each group has seven reading group members, and each person takes turns on duty one day a week. Originally, the three times after breakfast, lunch, and dinner were scheduled every day for the masses to read newspapers. In order not to affect the production of the masses, it was changed to reading the newspaper once after lunch every day during the busy farming season. Tables and chairs are set up at the main intersections to facilitate the masses to rest and absorb passers-by to sit around and listen to the news. When reading, we first select important materials, read them aloud in the original text, and then put forward the main points to explain them in popular terms. There is a blackboard newspaper written by Xintian Elementary School in the reading place for the audience to read on their own. In order to strengthen the work of the reading group, according to the specific situation of our village, in mid-November, we also stipulated a reading group covenant. The content includes: (1) Members of the reading group must take a certain amount of time every day to study the important content of the newspaper; (2) Take turns to explain and read newspapers to the masses. When explaining and reading newspapers, they must stand firm and must not distort policies and regulations; (3) Reading group members should also pay attention to collecting feedback from the masses, understand the living and production conditions of the masses, and write letters to tell the newspaper. The reading group should also frequently exchange experiences, and it was decided to hold a group meeting every week to study the work of the reading group. A reading group work summary meeting is held at the end of each month, and the leader and deputy leader are responsible for writing a written summary and sending it to the newspaper.

　　山村里的一个读报组
    江西宜春新田村读报组  黄旭光
    我们的农村读报小组，是新田区政府指示新田小学校，并邀请我们这些在乡知识分子共同筹备成立的。我们处在一个偏僻的山村，交通不方便，文化落后。一九五零年农历三月读报组初成立时，听读报的人很少，每次仅五、六个人，甚至有时候两三个人。而且，开始他们的出发点并不是读报、学习时事，多半是想在劳动后来休息、闲谈，但由于我们耐心的讲解时事，根据报纸，联系群众的实际生活宣传各种政策，并经过深入群众说服动员的过程，光我们一个读报小组，就已发展到二十个经常听众。而且他们都认识到听报对自己有好处。经过在读报组半年的学习，他们的政治认识、阶级觉悟都明显地提高了。对世界形势，一般群众都有了“美帝侵略者必败，爱好和平的人民必胜”的信念。目前我们这里正进行着伟大的土地改革工作，它是几千年以来农民的大喜事的开头。我们的读报组便以宣传时事和土地政策为中心，并且有计划地揭发坏分子造谣，来配合土改工作和抗美援朝运动。
    我们新田村的读报组在一九五零年七月以前，分桥上街、桥下街、河东街和我们脚寮下等四个读报小组，统归新田小学校负责领导。七月二十五日，学校方面召开了读报组工作会议。决定把上、下街合编成中心小组。每组七个读报组员，每星期每人轮值一天，原定每天早、午、晚饭后的三个时间为给群众读阅报纸。为了不影响群众生产，农忙时改为每天午饭后读一次报。在要路口设桌凳，以便群众歇息和吸收过路群众围坐听报。读时首先由我们选定重要材料，照原文朗读，然后提出要点来加以通俗的解释。读报的地方设有新田小学编写的黑板报，以便听众自看。为了加强读报组工作，根据我村的具体情况，于十一月中旬我们又规定了一个读报小组公约。其内容包括：（一）读报组的成员，每天必须抽出一定时间学习报纸重要内容；（二）轮流给群众讲读报纸，讲读报纸时，要站稳立场，不得曲解政策、法令；（三）读报组员还要注意搜集群众反映，了解群众的生活、生产情况，并写信告诉报社。读报组内部还要经常交流经验，决定每星期召开一次小组会，研究读报组工作。每月终召开一次读报组工作总结会议，由正副组长负责写成书面总结寄给报社。
