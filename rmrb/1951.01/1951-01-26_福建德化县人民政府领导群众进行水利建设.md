To the Editor:

The Dingxi Township, Yuhu Village, in the first district of our Dehua County originally had three small-scale water conservancy facilities, Daqian Dam, Bantou Dam, and Guizi Dam, available for use. However, due to the lack of unified management and operation over the years, and frequent disputes between villages, they were not fully utilized. In order to solve the above problems, the County People's Government's Construction Section and the County People's Bank's Agricultural Loan Department assisted local farmers in rebuilding the dams using the "people-run, government-assisted" method. The construction of the three dams required a total of 13.34 million yuan in material and technician costs, of which 8.84 million yuan was raised by local farmers, and the government loaned 4.5 million yuan (loaned to 87 middle and poor peasant households). It is estimated that the three dams can increase rice production by more than 38,500 jin per year.

During this construction, the method of holding meetings for discussion and persuasion was adopted to resolve decades of disputes caused by water use. For example, the water from the Daqian Dam can irrigate the fields of two villages, but Xiuxia Village, which benefits from the water source, has never borne any construction costs for dam repairs and embankment construction for decades. Now, the People's Government has adopted the principle of fair and reasonable burden sharing, with costs borne equally according to the number of benefiting fields. Another example is the water mill of the Guizi Dam. Whenever rice was being husked, it would obstruct the water use of downstream residents, frequently leading to fights and arguments. Now, everyone has stipulated that except when the water is high, the use of the water mill for husking rice is only permitted; at other times, no one is allowed to secretly use the water mill for husking rice. This is also an old problem of decades, and it has now been resolved.

According to what I have heard, the masses have responded very well to this matter. Some people said, "The People's Government can help solve problems that have existed throughout history. It truly is a government that resolves difficulties and disputes for the people." Therefore, the staff has also gained the high respect of the people.

### 福建德化县人民政府领导群众进行水利建设

　　福建德化县人民政府领导群众进行水利建设编辑同志：
    我县第一区丁溪乡?胡村原有大墘坝、坂头坝、龟子坝三条小型水利可供使用，但因历年来无人统一管理和经营，且经常发生各村间的纠纷，故未能予以充分利用。县人民政府建设科和县人民银行农贷股为解决上述问题，用“民办公助”的办法协助当地农民重新修建。修建三坝需材料费、技工费共一千三百三十四万元，其中八百八十四万元系由当地农民自筹，政府贷款数为四百五十万元（贷给中、贫农八十七户）。据估计三个坝水利每年可增产稻谷三万八千五百余斤。
    在这次修建中，采取了开会讨论，说服教育的办法，解决了数十年因用水而发生的纠纷。如大墘坝的水是可以灌溉两个村庄的田亩，而在水头受益的秀霞村却在数十年来对修坝筑堤的一切工程费用从不负担，现在则由人民政府掌握公平合理负担的原则，按受益田亩数，平均负担；又如龟子坝的水碓每遇舂米时，就妨碍了下游住户用水，而经常发生打架争吵的事件。现在则由大家规定：除非水大时准许用水碓舂米外，平时任何人不得偷用水碓舂米。这也是几十年的老问题，现在也得到解决了。
    据我所听到群众对此事的反映很好。有人说：“有史以来的问题，人民政府能帮助解决，真是替人民排难解纷的政府”。因此工作人员也得到了人民群众的高度敬爱。
