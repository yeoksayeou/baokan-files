To the Editor:

I am very grateful for your welcome and hospitality when I attended the meeting in Beijing. On my way home, I conveyed everywhere the situation of the National Congress of Combat Heroes and the powerful national defense army I saw. Everyone learned about the strength of the People's Republic of China and unanimously supported Chairman Mao and the heads of the Central People's Government. Wherever I went, I was welcomed and loved by the masses, which made me deeply feel that this honor was given to me by Chairman Mao. Several thousand representatives from the Qujing area who were transferred to attend the Farmers' Association expressed their willingness to dedicate themselves to the country, vigorously consolidate national defense, unanimously oppose American imperialism, and support friendly North Korea after I conveyed the instructions of Chairman Mao and other leaders. They were willing to eliminate the remaining bandits in the country and fight for the liberation of Tibet and Taiwan.

Now the militia in various places has been organized and is undergoing training. With the good cooperation of the People's Liberation Army and the broad masses of the people, the local bandits have been wiped out. The masses in various places are actively carrying out the work of evaluating production and investigating black land. After the work is completed and the new grain is stored in the warehouse, they will continue to reduce rent and return deposits, preparing for future land reform. They will also use the work of doing well as a practical action to resist America, aid Korea, defend the country, and defend the homeland.

　　云南宣威县民兵英雄樊能修谈云南人民热爱祖国编辑同志：
    我非常感谢你们对我在北京开会时的欢迎和招待。在我回家时，一路上我把全国战斗英雄代表大会的情形及我所见到的强大的国防军，到处传达，大家都知道了中华人民共和国的壮大，一致拥护毛主席及中央各人民政府首长。我所到各地，都得到群众的欢迎与爱戴，使我深深地感到这种光荣是毛主席给我的。在曲靖专区调来开农民协会的数千代表，经过我把毛主席及各首长的指示传达后，都表示愿意献身国家，大力巩固国防，一致反对美帝国主义，愿意支援友邦朝鲜，肃清国内残余匪徒，为解放西藏和台湾而战斗。
    现在各地民兵已组织完竣，正进行操练。在解放军与广大人民的良好配合下，本地土匪已将肃清，各地群众正积极做评产量查黑地工作，待工作完毕新粮入仓以后，即继续减租退押，准备将来实行土地改革。并以搞好这些工作，作为抗美援朝保家卫国的实际行动。
