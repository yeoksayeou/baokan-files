Xinhua News Agency, New York, January 24th: TASS reports that the Chairman of the American Progressive Party, Binson, and Secretary Baldwin, wrote to Truman regarding his recent messages to Congress. The letter stated: "Your State of the Union address, your economic message, and your budget message paint a picture of sacrifice, despair, and death. You want to conscript our eighteen-year-old sons, lower our living standards by twenty-five percent, subject our people to all the pain of war, and abandon our civil rights and freedoms... In order to execute this program, you propose to extort $140 billion from us in the next two years, or an average of $4,000 per family. Your foreign policy has completely failed, and the foreign policies of Taft and Hoover offer no hope of peace."

The letter succinctly put forward some demands, such as the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Korea, negotiations with China for a peaceful resolution, instructing the U.S. representative to the United Nations to vote in favor of the immediate admission of New China into the United Nations, agreeing to the proposal to convene a four-nation foreign ministers conference, and immediately ceasing the rearmament of West Germany and Japan.

　　美进步党领袖致书杜鲁门
    主张美军撤出朝鲜
    【本报讯】据新华社二十五日讯：塔斯社纽约二十四日讯：美国进步党主席宾逊和书记鲍尔温，就杜鲁门最近致国会的几篇咨文写信给杜鲁门。这封信说：“你的国情咨文，你的经济咨文，你的预算咨文绘出了一幅牺牲、绝望和死亡的图画。你要征召我们十八岁的儿子，降低我们生活水准百分之二十五，使我们人民遭到战争的一切痛苦，放弃我们的公民权利和自由……为了要执行这个纲领，你建议在今后两年中向我们勒索一千四百亿美元，或者说，每一家庭平均四千美元。你的外交政策是完全失败了，而塔夫脱与胡佛的外交政策也没有提供和平的希望。”
    信中扼要地提出了一些要求，如美军撤出朝鲜，与中国谈判和平的解决，训令美国驻联合国的代表投票赞成新中国立即进入联合国，同意召开四国外长会议的建议，以及立即停止重新武装西德和日本。
