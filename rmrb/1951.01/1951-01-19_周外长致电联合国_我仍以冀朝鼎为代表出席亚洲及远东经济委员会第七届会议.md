Xinhua News Agency, 18th: The Seventh Session of the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East and the meetings of its subordinate Industrial and Trade Committee will be held in Lahore in February this year. In this regard, Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai sent a telegram to UN Acting Secretary-General Awn on January 18th, requesting him to forward it to the Economic and Social Council and the member states of the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East. The telegram condemned the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East for refusing to recognize the legitimate representative of the People's Republic of China and allowing the illegal representative of the Kuomintang reactionary remnant group to attend the Sixth Session held in May last year and the meetings of its subordinate Industrial and Trade Committee. The telegram believes that this not only violates the United Nations Charter but also deprives China of its due rights on Asian and Far Eastern issues. Foreign Minister Zhou once again declared: The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China still designates Ji Chaoding as the representative to attend the Seventh Session of the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East and the meetings of its subordinate Industrial and Trade Committee. The illegal representatives of the Kuomintang reactionary remnant group are completely unqualified to participate in the meetings of the aforementioned committees and must be expelled from the committees. Without the participation of the representative of the People's Republic of China, which has a population of 475 million, any resolutions of the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East and its subordinate Industrial and Trade Committee meetings will be illegal and invalid.

　　周外长致电联合国
    我仍以冀朝鼎为代表出席亚洲及远东经济委员会第七届会议
    【新华社十八日讯】亚洲及远东经济委员会第七届会议及其所属工业和贸易委员会会议将于今年二月在拉合尔召开。我外交部周恩来部长为此于一月十八日致电联合国代理秘书长奥温，并请其转达经济暨社会理事会与亚洲及远东经济委员会各会员国。电中指斥亚洲及远东经济委员会去年五月间召开第六届会议及其所属工业和贸易委员会会议时竟然拒绝了我中华人民共和国合法代表，并允许了国民党反动残余集团的非法代表出席会议。电文认为这不但违背联合国宪章并且剥夺了我国在亚洲及远东问题上应有的权利。周外长再一次声明：中华人民共和国中央人民政府仍以冀朝鼎为出席亚洲及远东经济委员会第七届会议及其所属工业和贸易委员会会议的代表，中国国民党反动残余集团的非法代表完全没有参加上述各该委员会会议的资格，必须从各该委员会驱逐出去。没有四亿七千五百万人民的中华人民共和国的代表参加，任何亚洲及远东经济委员会及其所属工业和贸易委员会会议的决议，都将是非法的和无效的。
