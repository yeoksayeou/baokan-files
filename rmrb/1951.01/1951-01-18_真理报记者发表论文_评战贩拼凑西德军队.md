TASS, Moscow, January 14th: *Pravda*’s Berlin correspondent, Naumov, published an article entitled "A Deal Done Behind the People's Backs," stating: In the first ten days of the new year, war mongers have been frantically assembling a West German revanchist army. Eisenhower, an ominous figure, has appeared in Western Europe. American aggressors are rushing around, hoping that restoring the German fascist army can save them from future defeats. In their war frenzy, they are not even bothering with basic diplomacy with their European partners. The "hesitation" of Western European politicians regarding the rearmament of West Germany has driven American strategists mad, who are trying to present the world with a *fait accompli* as quickly as possible. They have been conducting long-planned, separate agreements with Bonn's revanchists behind the backs of their partners.

According to West German newspapers, secret negotiations were recently held in Frankfurt, involving U.S. High Commissioner for Germany, McCloy, U.S. Secretary of the Army, Pace, and two former Hitler generals, now Adenauer's advisors, Speidel and Heusinger. All decisions regarding the rearmament of West Germany have been made in secret. The German generals received concrete advice at the meeting regarding the recruitment, combat training, and organization of the new army.

The deal between the American imperialists and the West German revanchist clique is proceeding through mutual collusion, at the expense of the interests of the people of Western Europe and the German people.

American imperialists, in order to collect cannon fodder and find reliable constables to manage Europe, are prepared to satisfy the revenge desires of Hitler's generals and West German arms tycoons. Therefore, they are reviving the sinister forces of German militarism, thereby threatening the peace and security of the people of Western Europe. It is no accident that West German militarists are increasingly demanding the restoration of Germany's borders as of 1937.

The British and French rulers have revealed a truly pitiful appearance in dealing with such an extremely important issue as the re-militarization of West Germany. American generals are dealing with Nazi generals, while the British and French partners have to accept ready-made decisions.

Now, West German revanchists and their American friends are preparing a grand welcome for Eisenhower's arrival in Germany. The European MacArthur has promised to come to Germany at the end of January. He has already expressed his willingness to set up an office for his headquarters in Frankfurt. A group of war mongers are very happy about this, believing that Eisenhower will be able to overcome all obstacles and revive the German "Wehrmacht." But can he really do it? Western European realists are very doubtful about this. Eisenhower will encounter some unpleasant experiences when he arrives in West Germany, just as he recently did in Paris, Brussels, and other cities. Just a few days ago, even West German Deputy Chancellor Blücher said: Ninety-nine percent of the West German people are against re-militarization.

In West Germany, the movement against re-militarization is developing into a truly national movement. In recent days, a large number of writers, politicians, scientists, artists, former senior generals, and officers have joined this movement. The movement of patriotic forces against the revival of the Nazi army has gradually taken on a more organized form. Signatures against the revival of militarism have been collected in hundreds of enterprises. "Committees Against Re-militarization" have also been established one after another, becoming the leading centers of the struggle. The working people of West Germany will firmly say to the militarists: We are taking a different path, our path is towards peace and national unity. This path has been clearly indicated in the Prague Declaration of the Eight Foreign Ministers and in the letter from Prime Minister Grotewohl of the German Democratic Republic to Adenauer.

Messrs. Eisenhower, Truman, and Acheson disregard the interests and desires of Europeans who long for peace. They are unwilling to acknowledge the simple truth: that harsh shouts may work on corrupt politicians of the Schumann, Mock, Adenauer, and Schumacher types, but they cannot drive German youth into the barracks. The serious cracks that have appeared in the "North Atlantic" ship cannot be repaired with shouts and threats.

American aggressors are dangerously playing with fire by reviving West German revanchist militarism. The flames of anger have been ignited among the masses of people in West Germany, and when these flames erupt openly, the war instigators will face disaster.

    评战贩拼凑西德军队
    塔斯社莫斯科十四日电：真理报驻柏林记者瑙莫夫以《背着人民进行的买卖》为题发表论文称：新年的头十天中。战争贩子们进行着拼凑西德复仇主义军队的疯狂活动，艾森豪威尔这个预兆不祥的人物已在西欧出现。美国侵略者们正在急忙地奔走，他们一心希望，恢复德国法西斯军队可以使他们免遭未来的失败。他们在战争狂的高热中对于他们欧洲的伙计们连一点基本的圆滑手段都不用了。西欧政客们对重新武装西德所表现的“踌躇不前”已经使美国战略家发疯，这些战略家企图尽速在全世界面前拿出一个既成事实，他们已经背着他们的伙计们与波恩复仇主义分子进行久经策划的单独协议。
    据西德报纸报道称，最近秘密谈判在法兰克福举行，参与者是美国驻西德高级专员麦克洛埃、美国陆军部长佩斯、和两个前希特勒将领、现任阿登纳顾问的斯派达尔和豪辛格。一切关于重新武装西德的决定，都已在秘密中作出。德国将领们在会议上获得了关于新军队的征募、作战训练及编制方面的确实意见。
    美国帝国主义者与西德复仇主义分子集团之间的交易正在互相串通勾结中进行，而以西欧各国人民和德国人民的利益为其牺牲品。
    美帝国主义者为了搜集炮灰和物色管理欧洲的可靠宪兵，准备满足希特勒的将军们和西德军火大王们的报复的欲望。因此他们又在使德国军国主义的凶恶势力复活，从而威胁到西欧人民的和平与安全。西德军国主义分子日益频繁地要求重建德国在一九三七年的边界，这并不是偶然的。
    英法统治者在处理象西德重新军国主义化那样极端重要的问题上，露出了真正的可怜相。美国将军们和纳粹将军们打交道，而英法伙计们只好接受现成的决定。
    现在，西德报复分子和他们的美国朋友们正为着艾森豪威尔将莅临德国而在准备盛大欢迎，欧洲的麦克阿瑟答允在一月底前来德国。他已经表示他愿意在法兰克福设立他的总部的办事处。一群战争贩子们正因此而十分高兴，艾森豪威尔一定能够克服一切障碍而使德国“国防军”复活。可是，他真能够吗？西欧的现实主义者对于此事是十分怀疑的。艾森豪威尔到西德的时候也将遭到一点不愉快的经验，正如他最近在巴黎、布鲁塞尔和其他城市所遭受到的一样。就在几天以前，连西德副总理布吕契也说：西德人民有百分之九十九是反对重新军国主义化的。
    在西德，反对重新军国主义化的运动正在发展成为真正全国性的运动。最近几天来，又有大批作家、政治人物、科学和艺术工作者、过去的高级将领和军官等等参加了这次运动。爱国力量反对纳粹军队复活的运动，已渐渐采取更有组织的形式了。在成百的企业中都已征集了反对军国主义复活的签名。“反对重新军国主义化委员会”也已纷纷成立，成为斗争的领导中心。西德劳动人民将向军国主义分子坚决地说：我们走的是不同的道路，我们的道路是走向和平和国家统一的。这条道路，在八国外长的布拉格宣言和德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥致阿登纳的信中，都已明确地指示了出来。
    艾森豪威尔、杜鲁门和艾奇逊这些先生们漠视了渴望和平的欧洲人的利益和愿望。他们不愿承认简单的真理：即：强横的吆喝，对于舒曼和莫克，阿登纳和舒马赫等类型的腐败政客可以发生效果，但是却不能驱使德国青年进入兵营。“北大西洋”船上已经出现的严重的裂缝，是不能用吆喝和威胁来修补的。
    美国侵略者复活西德报复性的军国主义，是在危险地玩火。愤怒的火焰已在西德的人民大众中烧了起来，等到这火焰公开爆发时，战争挑拨者就碰上灾难了。
