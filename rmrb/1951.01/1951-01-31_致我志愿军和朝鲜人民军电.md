　　Xinhua News Agency, January 30th: The Beijing Minority Nationalities' Rally for Resisting America, Aiding Korea, and Opposing the American Arming of Japan sent a telegram to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army to express their condolences and respect. The telegram to the commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army stated:
　　"When our friendly neighbor Korea was subjected to the mad aggression of imperialists, and when the sacred border of our motherland was seriously threatened, you demonstrated the noble spirit of patriotism and internationalism, volunteered to come to Korea, fought shoulder to shoulder with our Korean brothers, and quickly inflicted annihilating blows on the American imperialists, which sealed the fate of the invaders. Your righteous and heroic actions have long won the support of the people of the world and strengthened the confidence in the inevitable victory of opposing aggression and striving for lasting peace.
　　To continue resisting America, aiding Korea, and opposing the arming of Japan, we, the various minority nationalities of Beijing, held a patriotic demonstration and parade today. We must strengthen our unity and pledge to take practical actions to be your backing. We will fight to the end against U.S. imperialism's aggression against Korea, its arming of Japan!"
　　The telegram to the Korean People's Army stated: "When your beloved motherland was invaded by the barbaric American imperialists, under the leadership of General Kim Il-sung, you waged a great war of national defense, inflicting annihilating blows on the enemy, causing the aggressors to suffer a decisive defeat. We cheer for your victory! Today, the American imperialists, disregarding the opposition of the people of the world, are plotting a separate peace treaty with Japan and rearming Japan, attempting to make a last-ditch struggle. We, the minority nationalities of Beijing, are holding a demonstration parade to resist America, aid Korea, and oppose the arming of Japan. Under the firm leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the great leader Chairman Mao, we, all nationalities, are resolutely united to oppose U.S. imperialist aggression against Korea, Taiwan, and the arming of Japan, and pledge to fight for resisting America, aiding Korea, and defending lasting world peace!"
