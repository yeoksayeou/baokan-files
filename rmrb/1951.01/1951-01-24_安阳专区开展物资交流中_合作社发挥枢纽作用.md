　　Anyang District Carries Out Material Exchange; Cooperatives Play a Pivotal Role
　　[This Newspaper News] The Anyang District of Pingyuan Province has actively launched material exchange work, satisfying the needs of the vast number of farmers to sell agricultural products after the harvest and exchange them for production materials or living materials.
　　In the unfolding of material exchange work in this district, in addition to the state-owned trading company playing a significant role, cooperatives have also played a pivotal role.
　　The cooperatives at all levels in this district have a clear division of labor in material exchange work: the district-level cooperative manages export products; the county-level cooperative manages exchanges between counties; and the district-level cooperative manages materials within the county. Due to division of labor and cooperation, the management strength of cooperatives at all levels has been more fully utilized, which is more conducive to the development of material exchange work. The district-level cooperative has signed a number of exchange contracts and agreements with various places, such as agreements to purchase a total of 680,000 jin of pepper, peach kernels, dried persimmons, dates, and peanuts from Tangyin, Linxian, and other places. In addition, in cooperation with the grain company and packing factory, it has signed contracts with Junxian, Yexian and other counties to pre-purchase 85,000 reed mats and pockets and homespun cloth.
　　County, district, and village cooperatives have also carried out the exchange of local products according to the production, sales, availability, and absence of materials in each district. Counties, districts, and villages have also extensively carried out mutual exchanges. Thirty-five village cooperatives in Tangyin signed eighteen exchange agreements, exchanging materials such as sweet potatoes, white oil, and cotton paper. In addition, they also mutually ordered carts, farm tools, and bricks. Through these exchanges, products that were slow-moving in some areas quickly found sales channels in other areas.
　　In order to ensure the smooth progress of material exchange, the district actively repaired roads and organized transportation while organizing exchanges. In terms of transportation work, the masses in various counties have spontaneous organizations. For example, thirteen villages in Tangyin and some villages in Linxian have organized transportation teams. However, due to the lack of an overall plan for this work in the district, progress has been slow. In addition, the district lacks specific guidance for private businesses in material exchange, and the role of private merchants has not been brought into play. These two points should be improved.

　　安阳专区开展物资交流中
    合作社发挥枢纽作用
    【本报讯】平原省安阳专区积极展开物资交流工作，满足了广大农民在丰收后出售农产品，换回生产资料或生活资料的要求。
    该区物资交流工作的展开，除国营贸易公司起了很大作用外，合作社也发挥了枢纽的作用。
    该区各级合作社在物资交流工作中，有明确的分工：专区社经营外销产品；县社经营县与县之间的交换；区社经营本县境内的物资。由于分工合作，更充分地发挥了各级社的经营力量，更有利于物资交流工作的开展。专区社曾与各地订立了若干交换合同和协议，如向汤阴、林县等地订立收购共计六十八万斤花椒、桃仁、柿饼、枣、花生等的协议。此外并与粮食公司、打包厂配合向浚、邺等县订立了预购八万五千领席和口袋、土布的合同。
    各县、区、村社也根据各区产、销、有、无等情况，展开内地土产交换。县与县、区与区、村与村之间也广泛地展开了相互交换。汤阴三十五个村社，订立了十八件交换协议，交换的物资有：红薯、白油、棉纸等。此外还相互订购大车、农具、砖等。通过这些交换，使在某些地区是冷货的产品，到另一地区便迅速找到了销路。
    该专区为了保证物资交流的顺利进行，与组织交换的同时，积极修整道路和组织运输。在运输工作上，各县群众已有自发的组织。如汤阴曾有十三个村、林县有部分村庄已组织了运输组。但由于专区对这一工作无通盘计划，因而进展缓慢。此外，该专区在物资交流中对私营商业还缺乏具体领导，私商的作用未能发挥。这两点是应该改进的。
