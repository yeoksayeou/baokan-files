　　Shenyang Private Chengfa Iron Factory
    Production Continues to Rise Over Two Years
    Workers Increase from Seven to Two Hundred
Respected Chairman Mao:
    As we welcome the victorious New Year of 1951, we report to you on the situation of our factory. Our factory is a relatively well-equipped one among private heavy industries in the Northeast. Before liberation, our factory was occupied by the Kuomintang reactionaries, and the factory buildings and machinery were damaged by them. In November 1948, these reactionaries were defeated by our heroic People's Liberation Army, Shenyang was liberated, and our factory resumed work in February 1949 with the help of the People's Government. At that time, there were only seven people from both labor and management. Thanks to the help of the Party, the trade union, and the People's Government, some labor-management relations issues were resolved. Initially, the factory took on a batch of work worth 1.4 billion Northeast currency from Anshan Iron and Steel Company. The workers worked hard, not only completing the order ahead of schedule but also ensuring quality. The factory received praise upon delivery, boosting everyone's confidence, and labor-management relations became more normal. Under the government's correct policy of taking into consideration both public and private interests, benefiting both labor and management, and developing production, our factory has grown from seven people to two hundred and sixty-seven people in the past two years. A labor-management consultation meeting has been established, resolving many production problems. Over the past year, most of the processing orders for public enterprises have been completed ahead of schedule. In particular, the fifty wind pumps ordered by the Ministry of Railways in December last year were not only completed eight days ahead of schedule but also ensured that the quality met the requirements. In November last year, the entire factory launched a patriotic labor competition, with workers, staff, logistics personnel, and technicians participating. The entire factory also established a technology and work research association, striving to improve technology and implement the responsibility system. During the competition, two workshops and two groups improved technical operations and tools, achieving remarkable results. The entire year produced a Ma Hengchang-type group, one municipal model worker, and nine advanced producers. The entire factory received a first-class pennant from the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce. Our volunteer army has achieved great victories in Korea. To express our enthusiasm, the factory contributed a total of 1,770 consolation bags, and the workers contributed 631 consolation bags. Our production is becoming normal! Our lives have been improved unprecedentedly! This is all thanks to you. When we drink water, we remember the source and cannot forget your kindness. We will never be satisfied with our existing achievements. We will further delve into technology, overcome difficulties, and correct shortcomings, and under your leadership, we will fight to the end to eliminate the enemy and build our country.
        We wish you
    Longevity without end!
                                All employees of Shenyang Private Chengfa Iron Factory

　　沈阳私营成发铁工厂
    两年中生产不断上升
    工人由七个增至二百敬爱的毛主席：
    我们在迎接一九五一年的胜利新春时候，向你报告我们工厂的情况。我们工厂在东北私营重工业中，是比较设备完备的一个工厂。解放前，我们的工厂被国民党反动派占用，厂房、机器都曾被他们破坏。一九四八年十一月，这些反动派被我们英勇的解放军打垮，解放了沈阳，我们的工厂在人民政府的扶助下，于一九四九年二月复工了。当时劳资双方仅七个人。由于党、工会和人民政府的帮助，又解决了一些劳资关系问题。开始厂方由鞍山钢铁公司揽了一批价值东北币十四亿元的活，工人们努力工作，不仅提前完成订货任务，并保证了质量。在交货时工厂受到了表扬，提高了大家的信心，劳资关系更正常了。在政府正确执行公私兼顾，劳资两利发展生产的政策下，二年来，我们厂由七个人发展到二百六十七个人，建立了劳资协商会议，解决了生产上好多问题。一年来，对公营企业的加工订货任务，绝大部分均能提前完成。特别是去年十二月份对铁道部订货的五十台风泵，不仅提前八天完成，并且保证质量合于要求。我们在去年十一月，全厂展开爱国主义的劳动大竞赛，工人、职员、勤杂人员、技术人员都参加了竞赛。全厂并建立了技术和工作研究会，力求改进技术，贯彻责任制。在竞赛中，有两个车间、两个小组改进了技术操作和工具，获得显著成绩。全年产出一个马恒昌型的小组，市劳动模范一人，九名先进生产者。全厂获得了市工商联合会一等锦旗一面。我志愿军在朝鲜接连获得伟大的胜利。为了表示我们的热情，厂方共献慰问袋一七七○个，工人献慰问袋六三一个。我们的生产走向正常了！我们的生活空前提高了！这都是你给我们的。我们饮水思源，不能忘了你的恩德。我们决不满足于现有的成绩。我们将更进一步钻研技术，克服困难，纠正缺点，在你的领导下，为消灭敌人，建设我们国家而奋斗到底。
        祝您
    万寿无疆！
                                沈阳市私营成发铁工厂全体职工
