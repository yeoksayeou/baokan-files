Editor's Note: Providing preferential treatment is one of the most important and regular tasks of governments at all levels. According to Article 25 of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference: "The families of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers who have living difficulties shall receive preferential treatment from the state and society. Disabled soldiers and demobilized soldiers who participated in the revolutionary war shall be given appropriate arrangements by the people's government to enable them to earn a living and establish a career." In the past year, governments at all levels have made considerable efforts in preferential treatment work and have achieved certain results. The letter to Chairman Mao from the families of revolutionary martyrs, soldiers, and staff members in Xinji Town, Gaoyang County, Hebei Province, and the letter from Tao Mingshan, a military dependent in Wu Liangbai Village, Heishan County, Liaoxi Province, to his son, published in this newspaper today, are two representative letters. Thanks to the help of the local people's government and the masses, they have solved the difficulties in production and life, and their lives are getting better day by day.

However, it must also be pointed out that the phenomenon of not attaching importance to preferential treatment work still exists in many areas today. As reflected in the letters from comrades Zhang Peiting and Wang Fulin, this attitude of indifference and disregard for preferential treatment work is completely wrong. The victory of the Chinese revolution is inseparable from the glorious sacrifices of the martyrs and the bloody struggles of the revolutionary soldiers. Therefore, we should treat the families of martyrs and revolutionary soldiers with preferential treatment and should resettle and care for the honorary soldiers. Conscientiously implement the preferential treatment regulations.

Currently, the "Support the Army and Give Preferential Treatment to Families" campaign is being launched. In addition to checking and correcting the shortcomings in preferential treatment work, people's governments at all levels should organize and help the families of revolutionary martyrs, revolutionary soldiers, and staff members, as well as revolutionary disabled soldiers and demobilized soldiers, to engage in production so that they can quickly settle down and establish a career. This is an important aspect of doing a good job in preferential treatment work.

Gaoyang Xinji Town Revolutionary Military Dependents, etc.
Reporting Production to Chairman Mao

Respected Chairman Mao:

The New Year has arrived, and you must be concerned about our lives. To reassure you, we are writing to tell you about our production and living conditions.

There are thirty-seven households of revolutionary martyrs, revolutionary soldiers, and revolutionary staff members in our village. Among them, twenty-three households enjoy the treatment of being tilled on their behalf due to lack of labor, with a total of eighty-three mu of land being cultivated. When work points were implemented at the beginning of last year, some of the tillers on behalf were not working conscientiously, and the village government immediately rectified them. In terms of production, village cadres were assigned to help us manage our families and inspected the fields, with clear rewards and punishments, so that the tillers on behalf maintained constant enthusiasm, ensuring that our crops could be sown and harvested in a timely manner; we also had a good harvest last year.

Our lives are really getting better, and some households have already reached the level of "two parts grain, one part surplus". In addition to eating grain, Feng Yan, a military dependent, saved a thousand catties of cotton; Li Shufen, a military dependent, bought a new waterwheel; Li Baoshan, a military dependent, bought half a cow. We believe that under the leadership of the people's government, our lives will get better year by year.

In order to do a good job in the work of tilling on behalf in 1951, the village people's government convened a meeting with us and decided to launch a manure collecting movement to apply more fertilizer to our land. We are now ready for spring plowing. Our village is a cotton-producing area, and in order to ensure increased cotton production in 1951, we have specially selected good seeds.

Chairman Mao! Please don't worry about us. We must ensure that our sons, brothers, and husbands on the front lines and at their work posts have no family worries, and encourage them to completely eliminate the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, defeat the aggression of American imperialism, liberate Tibet and Taiwan, assist Korea, and drive American imperialism out of Asia.

With Respect,
The Entire Revolutionary Martyrs, Soldiers, and Staff Families of Xinji Town, Gaoyang County, Hebei Province
Written on behalf of: Yin Qinyi, Age Eighteen

### 高阳辛冀镇革命军人家属等  向毛主席报告生产

    编者按：优抚工作是各级人民政府重要而经常的工作之一。根据中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领第二十五条规定：“革命烈士和革命军人的家属，其生活困难者应受国家和社会的优待。参加革命战争的残废军人和退伍军人，应由人民政府给以适当安置，使能谋生立业。”在过去一年中，各级人民政府对优抚工作是做了不少的努力，而且获得一定的成绩。本报今天所发表的河北高阳县辛冀镇革命烈士、军人和工作人员家属给毛主席的信及辽西省黑山县吴梁百村军属陶明山给他儿子的信，就是具有代表意义的两封信。他们由于当地人民政府和群众的帮助，解决了生产和生活上的困难，日子过得已经一天比一天好起来了。
    但同时也必须指出，不重视优抚工作的现象，今天在不少地区还是存在的，正如张佩庭、王伏林同志来信中所反映的情况，此种对优抚工作漠不关心和置之不理的态度是完全错误的。中国革命的胜利是和先烈的光荣牺牲及革命军人的流血斗争不可分的。因此我们应该优待烈士和革命军人家属，应该安置和照顾荣誉军人。认真贯彻优抚条例。
    目前正展开“拥军优属”运动，各地人民政府除检查并纠正优抚工作中的缺点外，应好好组织和帮助革命烈士、革命军人和工作人员的家属及革命残废军人和复员军人等，进行生产，使他们能够迅速安家立业，这是作好优抚工作的一个重要环节。
　　高阳辛冀镇革命军人家属等
    向毛主席报告生产敬爱的毛主席：
    过新年了，您一定关心着我们的生活。为了让您放心，特把我们的生产与生活的情况，写信告诉您。
    我们村里共有革命烈士家属、革命军人家属和革命工作人员家属三十七户。其中有二十三户因缺乏劳力享受着代耕待遇，共耕地八十三亩。在去年初实行工票时，有的代耕员不认真作活，村政府马上就进行了整顿。在生产上，村干部分工帮我们管家，下地检查，赏罚严明，使代耕员保持了经常的积极性，保证了我们的庄稼能及时播种与收割；去年并得到了丰收。
    我们的日子真是好起来了，有的户已达耕二余一。军人家属冯眼除了吃粮外，还存下千斤棉花；军人家属李树芬买了一辆新水车；军人家属李宝善买了半头牛。我们相信在人民政府的领导下，我们的生活一定会一年比一年好起来。
    村人民政府为作好一九五一年的代耕工作，召集我们开了会，决定发动一筐粪运动，给我们的地里多施肥。现在我们已准备好春耕了，我们村是产棉区，为了保证一九五一年的棉花增产，我们特别选了好种籽。
    毛主席！请您不必惦念我们。我们一定要使在前线上的、在工作岗位上的儿子、兄弟、丈夫没有家庭顾虑，鼓励他们为彻底消灭蒋介石残余匪帮，打垮美帝的侵略，解放西藏、台湾，援助朝鲜，把美帝赶出亚洲去。
    此致敬礼
            河北省高阳县辛冀镇全体革命
          烈士、军人、工作人员家属启
            代笔人  殷勤一、十八
