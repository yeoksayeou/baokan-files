　　Shanxi Winter Study in January
　　By Our Correspondent Chang Jianghe

　　The Progress of Winter Study

　　In Shanxi Province, the winter study movement, after being discussed and studied at the provincial workers and peasants education conference in early September last year, and the official release of the winter study instructions on October 14th, each special district and county convened meetings to communicate and deploy the plan. At the same time, they carried out centralized training for volunteer teachers and intellectuals in the countryside. Most of the winter schools in the province started classes around November 15th. In the past month, the winter study work has developed rapidly and achieved unprecedented results. According to incomplete statistics in November, in the old liberated area of Xingxian Special District, nine counties (Xingxian, Linxian, Lishi, Wuzhai, Kelan, Hequ, Baode, Pianguan, Fangshan) had already opened 2,396 winter schools, accounting for 90.6% of the original plan of 2,642. Among them, Xingxian reached 100%. The two special districts with the weakest winter study foundation, Linfen and Yuncheng, also reached about 65% of the original plan (Hongdong, Zhaocheng, and other five counties exceeded the original plan by 19%).

　　Regarding the number of students enrolled, according to statistics from five typical villages in Xingxian Special District: Zaowa in Linxian, Hehuicun in Hequ County, Quanze Village in Lishi County, Nanwa Village and Hewan Village in Wuzhai County, out of 403 young people who should be enrolled, 346 have already enrolled; 203 middle-aged people participated in literacy learning, accounting for more than 80.5% of the total number of middle-aged people. Among those enrolled, cadres and activists played a leading role. For example, in Nanwa and Hewan villages in Wuzhai County, village cadres and activists participated in literacy learning.

　　Reasons for the Achievements

　　The main reasons for achieving the above results within a month are threefold:

　　First, the leadership attaches great importance, and the relevant departments cooperate well. Various places have listed winter study work as one of the four major central tasks in winter. Each commissioner, county head, and county secretary personally participated in the relevant meetings, and utilized various people's representative conferences, expanded cadre meetings, model worker meetings, women's congresses, autumn grain collection meetings, and other meetings to mobilize people. Because of the leadership's emphasis, this year's winter study generally achieved in-depth and widespread mobilization. Moreover, the various preparations for winter study were also relatively thorough. For example, the establishment and improvement of cultural and educational committees at all levels, the centralized training of volunteer teachers, the compilation and printing of teaching materials, the distribution of textbooks, the summary of experiences, and the rewards for models have all been improved compared to previous years. Among them, the centralized training of volunteer teachers was particularly common. According to statistics from 57 counties and Taiyuan City (suburbs), a total of 16,789 volunteer teachers were trained (volunteer teachers who received training in batches and small-scale supplementary training were not included in the statistics). Especially during the movement, most counties did timely inspections and guidance, and reported commendations. The best example is Xingxian Special District, which has issued three circulars and one instruction based on the situation and problems found during the inspection, which has greatly helped the work.

　　Second, volunteer teachers have high enthusiasm. Various places have paid attention to solving problems from the aspects of ideology, teaching content, and teaching experience during training. Therefore, most volunteer teachers are very enthusiastic and feel that they have the resources and methods. At the same time, attention has been paid to solving the difficulties of volunteer teachers, such as proposing to organize the masses to exchange labor with volunteer teachers for production, cadres taking the lead in helping to run winter schools, primary school teachers helping to prepare lessons, and strengthening the guarantee work of transmission stations. Therefore, ideological problems such as volunteer teachers "being afraid of delaying work," "being afraid that cadres will not help," and "being afraid of not being able to teach" were basically resolved during the training. Many volunteer teachers challenged each other at the end of the training. In Fencheng, several volunteer teachers took down the ancestral plaques that no one dared to touch in the past and used them as blackboards. Some even voluntarily lent the offering table to the people's school. They recognized the glory of this work and were able to understand the importance of their work from a political perspective, so many moving deeds emerged.

　　Third, the broad masses actively demand to study. The masses' strong demand for culture has been very evident in the winter studies of the past two years and the people's schools of last year. In many villages in the old liberated areas, school buildings were built, textbooks were purchased, and production was automatically organized to solve the funding for winter studies even before the winter schools started. The masses in Yishi County snapped up all the textbooks and teaching materials purchased by the Xinhua branch in the county in three days. Their demands have progressed from simply recognizing a few characters or identifying tickets in the past. However, it should be recognized that this is only a positive factor, and in-depth mobilization work must still be carried out. For example, the situation in some new districts where mothers-in-law are afraid that their daughters-in-law will file for divorce after attending winter school should be paid attention to and resolved.

　　Several Issues That Must Be Addressed

　　1. Wavering in the implementation of policies: One is to emphasize cultural learning and neglect the political education of resisting America and aiding Korea; another is to say verbally that the focus is on cultural learning, but in practice, political learning is still the main focus; and another is to conduct cultural learning and political production education in a mutually unrelated and isolated manner. This is manifested in the fact that things that can be connected are not connected, and things that can be integrated are not integrated, resulting in simple cultural learning, teaching single characters, and simple political learning, attending large classes, which affects the masses' learning enthusiasm. Some villages in the suburbs of Taiyuan even put forward the erroneous slogan of "organizing winter schools after the anti-American and aid-Korea education is carried out." These three phenomena are based on unclear policy thinking, a lack of in-depth study of the provincial government's winter study guidelines, and a lack of methods for integration. Various places should correct this in a timely manner through inspection, guidance, and instruction work.

　　2. Insufficient ideological mobilization of the masses, with the existence of coercive orders: Relatively speaking, there has been great progress compared with previous years across the province, but there are still serious shortcomings in certain issues or individual regions. Just looking at the work of training volunteer teachers, almost every county, except for the old liberated areas with a good foundation, has a tendency to conscript, replace, and dispatch people. Some counties in Linfen Special District forced demobilized personnel to receive training, saying, "We have been doing work since the Anti-Japanese War, and now it's your turn to support this effort!" Xin County Special District even allowed "altar masters" and "point instructors" of Yiguandao to be volunteer teachers. Such political paralysis and an unserious attitude toward work should attract the attention of local leaders. Secondly, from the existing report materials, it can be seen that in mobilizing the masses to attend winter schools, some areas only emphasized the leading role of cadres and party members, and threatened the masses with "cadres are still studying, how can you not?" while lacking mobilization from the perspective of their personal learning interests, or more or less reflecting the view of pursuing numbers and simply completing tasks. Although this approach may create a temporary superficial sensation, the consequences will inevitably be lukewarm. It must be recognized that the masses' cultural liberation is a conscious movement of self-liberation. Any coercive orders and paternalistic practices will only increase the difficulties of the work and will not have other gains.

　　3. Poor quality of volunteer teachers: According to a survey of 10,716 volunteer teachers in 29 counties and Taiyuan City in seven special districts, those with an educational level below junior primary school accounted for 69.1% of the total, including 115 illiterate people, and those with an educational level above senior primary school accounted for only 29.7%. The educational level of volunteer teachers in Changzhi Special District was the lowest, with those below the level of junior primary school reaching 81%, and 2.7% being illiterate. To remedy and solve this problem, it is necessary to seize the transmission work and do a good job in leading the volunteer teachers' learning, earnestly mobilize primary school teachers to help prepare lessons, organize them to learn, and advocate learning while teaching. Methods such as "using people to teach people" in Changzhi Special District and fixed transmission points and lines in Xingxian Special District can be adopted.

　　4. From the perspective of leadership ideological understanding and specific practices, effectively solving the contradiction between the central work and winter study is the primary issue in carrying out the winter study movement. Past experience has proved that areas where winter study work is done well tend to carry out central work easily; and neglecting winter study and only engaging in central work, or only engaging in winter study and neglecting the combination with central work, will inevitably be affected. Areas with this problem should quickly seek solutions.

　　5. Grasping "paying attention to consolidation in development" is a major issue for further developing the current winter study movement. Various places should focus their guidance on leading volunteer teachers to do a good job in teaching, so as to use the results to mobilize and consolidate the effect of the masses' learning enthusiasm, and prevent the movement from being tight at the beginning and loose at the end.

　　山西冬学一月
    本报通讯员  常江河
    冬学开展的情况
    山西省冬学运动，自在去年九月初省工农教育会议上讨论研究，并于十月十四日正式发布冬学指示后，各专区、县先后召开会议进行了传达与布置，同时对义务教员与在乡知识分子实行集训。全省大部冬学在十一月十五日先后开学。一个月来，冬学工作飞速发展，获得空前成绩。据十一月份不完全的统计，老区兴县专区的九个县（兴县、临县、离石、五寨、岢岚、河曲、保德、偏关、方山）已有二千三百九十六座冬学开学，为原计划二千六百四十二座的百分之九十点六。其中兴县达到百分之百。冬学基础最差的临汾、运城两专区，也约达原计划的百分之六十五（洪洞、赵城等五县超过原计划的百分之十九）。
    入学人数，据兴县专区的临县枣窊，河曲县河会村，离石县铨则村，五寨县南洼村与河湾村五个典型村的统计，应入学青年四百零三人，已有三百四十六人入学；壮年参加识字学习的，有二百零三人，占壮年总数的百分之八十点五强。在入学中，干部、积极分子起了带头作用。如五寨县南洼、河湾两村，村干部、积极分子都参加了识字学习。
            获得成绩的原因
    在一个月内能取得上述成绩，主要原因有三：
    第一、领导重视，各有关部门配合得好。各地曾将冬学工作列为冬季四大中心工作之一。各专员、县长、县书亲自参加了有关的各种会议，并利用各界人民代表会议、扩大干部会、劳模会、妇代会、秋征会和其他会议，做了动员。因为领导的重视，使今年的冬学一般的做到了深入广泛的动员。并且，冬学的各项准备工作也做得较为充分。如各级文教委员会的建立与健全，义务教员的集训，教材编印，课本发行，经验总结，模范奖励等方面，都较往年完善。其中义务教员集训工作，尤为普遍，据五十七个县和太原市（郊）的统计，共集训义务教员一万六千七百八十九名（分批与小型补训的义务教员，尚未统计在内）。特别是在运动中，大部县做到了及时检查辅导，通报表扬。最好的如兴县专区，根据视导情况与问题，已发出三个通报，一个指示，对工作有很大帮助。
    第二、义务教员情绪高。各地在训练中，注意了从思想、教学内容、教学经验等方面来解决问题，因而大多数义务教员的情绪都很高，觉得有了资本，有了办法。同时注意解决义务教员的困难，如提出组织群众与义务教员换工生产，干部带头帮助办冬学，小学教员帮助备课，加强传授站等保证工作。因而义务教员“怕误工”，“怕干部不帮助”，“怕教不了”等思想问题，在集训时便基本得到解决。很多义务教员在训练结束时，互相提出挑战竞赛。汾城有几个义务教员，将过去从没人敢动的祖留大门匾，摘下来作了黑板，还有的自动将供桌借给民校。他们认识到这个工作的光荣，并能从政治意义上来认识自己的工作的重要性，因此出现了不少动人事迹。
    第三、广大群众积极要求学习。群众对文化的强烈要求，在前年冬学与去年民校中，已反映得十分明显。老区很多村子，不等冬学开学，就修建校址，购置课本，自动搞生产解决冬学经费等。猗氏县群众在三天中，将该县新华支店所购课本教材，抢购一空。他们已较过去只为识几个字或认认票子的要求，提高了一步。但应当认识，这只是一种积极因素，还必须进行深入动员工作。例如在新区有的婆婆怕媳妇上冬学后闹离婚的情形，就应引起注意并予以解决。
            必须注意的几个问题
    一、执行方针上的摇摆现象：一种是重视文化学习，忽视抗美援朝的政治教育；一种是口头上说是以学习文化为主，实际执行的仍是以学习政治为主；还有一种是文化学习与政治生产教育互不相关地割裂进行，表现在能联系的不联系，能渗透的不渗透，造成单纯的学文化、教单字，单纯的学政治，上大课，影响了群众的学习情绪。太原市郊有的村还提出“抗美援朝教育进行之后，再办冬学”的错误口号。这三种现象，都是基于政策思想不明确，对省府冬学方针研究的不深刻，和结合上没有办法的缘故。各地应通过检查、辅导、传授工作及时纠正。
    二、对群众思想发动不够，存在着强迫命令现象：以全省来说较之往年是有很大进步，但在某个问题或个别地区，仍有严重缺点存在。单就集训义务教员工作来看，除基础好的老区外，几乎每县都有拉夫、顶替、派差的偏向。临汾专区有的县逼着还乡人员去受训，并说：“抗战以来我们做工作，现在轮也轮着你们去支这一差！”忻县专区竟有让一贯道的“坛主”和“点传师”当义务教员的。这种政治上的麻痹与对工作不严肃的态度，应引起当地领导上的注意。其次，从现有报告材料中看出，在发动群众上冬学时，部分地区只是强调干部、党员带头，并以“干部还上学，你能不上？”来威胁群众，而缺乏从其学习的切身利益上去发动，或多或少反映了追求数字与单纯完成任务的观点。这种作法虽可能造成一时的表面上的轰轰烈烈，后果却必然是冷冷淡淡。必须认识：群众在文化上的翻身，是自求解放的自觉运动，任何强迫命令和包办代替作法，除增加工作上的困难之外，是不会有其他收获的。
    三、义务教员质量差：据七个专区的二十九个县和太原市一万零七百一十六个义务教员的调查，初小以下程度的占总数的百分之六十九点一，其中并有文盲一百一十五人，高小以上程度的只有百分之二十九点七。长治专区的义务教员的程度最低，初小程度以下的，竟达百分之八十一，并有百分之二点七是文盲。为补救解决这个问题，必须抓紧传授和做好领导义务教员学习的工作，认真发动小学教员帮助准备课，组织他们学习，提倡一面学，一面教。像长治专区的“以民教民”，和兴县专区的固定传授点线等方法，都可以采用。
    四、从领导思想认识上和具体做法上，切实解决中心工作与冬学的矛盾，是当前开展冬学运动中首要问题。过去的经验证明，大凡冬学工作做得好的地区，中心工作也容易开展；而不搞冬学，只搞中心工作，或只搞冬学忽视结合中心工作的偏废现象，必然都会受到影响。存在这一问题的地区，亟应迅速求得解决。
    五、掌握“发展中注意巩固”，是当前冬学运动进一步开展的一个主要问题。各地应将指导运动的重点，放在领导义务教员做好教学工作上，以收用成绩来动员与巩固群众学习情绪的效果，勿使运动前紧后松。
