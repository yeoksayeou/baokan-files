My Views on the Provisional Regulations for Private Enterprises
　　Chen Shutong

　　"Developing production and promoting economic prosperity" is the prerequisite for establishing socialism and the goal of economic construction during the New Democratic period. China's production is backward, and to achieve socialism, it must go through a relatively long New Democratic process. In this process, the development of production must use various different methods: "so that various social and economic components, under the leadership of the state-owned economy, can divide labor and cooperate, each getting what it deserves," in order to promote the economic prosperity of the entire society. Therefore, private enterprises are what the People's Government wants to encourage and support. The false prosperity before liberation was due to inflation, constantly rising prices, and various enterprises and individuals rushing to buy goods, either hoarding for profit or storing for future use, everyone harboring a fluke mentality and taking speculation as commonplace. In this way, the general public was indeed impoverished, and even speculators were becoming increasingly distressed internally. Therefore, before liberation, everyone felt precarious. The People's Government, with great魄力, overcame decades of inflation in less than a year, creating a rare miracle, stabilizing prices across the country, and gradually stabilizing people's lives. However, because hoarders could not profit, they rushed to sell goods, and businesses opened for speculation had no foundation, resulting in product stagnation. In addition, with labor-capital relations yet to be improved, there were frequent business closures, which was an unavoidable temporary phenomenon at that time. After the summer of last year, the People's Government adjusted industry and commerce again, and various industries gradually improved, and private enterprises gradually increased. In order to encourage this trend, and also to bring it into line with the right track, the government formulated the Provisional Regulations for Private Enterprises, which were promulgated at the end of last year.

　　The People's Government's policy of developing production and promoting economic prosperity is to "take into account both public and private interests, and benefit both labor and capital." The Private Enterprise Regulations are fully in line with this principle. According to Article 28 of the Common Program: "All undertakings that are related to the lifeline of the country and are sufficient to control the people's livelihood shall be operated uniformly by the state," which is natural. Outside this scope, according to Article 30 of the Common Program: "The People's Government shall encourage the enthusiasm of private economic undertakings that are conducive to the national economy and the people's livelihood and support their development." The Provisional Regulations for Private Enterprises promulgated now are the implementation of this provision. Article 1 of the Regulations (hereinafter referred to as the Regulations) explains this. China's industrial and commercial organizations have old sole proprietorships and partnerships, as well as new joint-stock companies and other different forms, and of the more than 1.3 million industrial and commercial households in the country, only over 10,000 use the new forms, and the rest are mostly old ones. Therefore, Article 3 of the Regulations includes these various organizations, all of which are to be encouraged and supported, and are not limited to the organization of companies, which is the meaning of taking care of all private enterprises, which was not found in the old company law of the past. In order to dispel investors' concerns, Article 8 of the Regulations stipulates that "the property and business of the enterprise shall be fully protected, and the right to operate and manage shall belong to the investor." Moreover, not only for the sake of opening and resuming business, but also Article 15 takes into account changes in the scope of business, the addition of branch institutions, relocation of regions, and also takes into account changes in industry, suspension of business, resumption of business, closure of business, and dissolution. In order to protect the interests of investors, Article 9 stipulates that if there is an urgent need of the state, or there are important technical improvements or inventions, and it is not possible to obtain profits in a short period of time, there may be preferential treatment of tax reduction or exemption. At the same time, there is Article 6 to prevent blind production control, which is all out of the spirit of protecting investors' interests. Article 25 stipulates the profit distribution ratio. The surplus of company-organized enterprises should be appropriated 10 percent to the reserve fund, which is to consolidate the company. Although the shareholder dividend is limited to no more than 8 percent, in reality the dividend has not yet reached this figure; moreover, shareholders' bonuses and directors' supervisors' managers' factory directors still have remuneration, generally no less than 60 percent of the provisions, which is determined by the shareholders. In order to protect the interests of shareholders, in addition to the various provisions in many articles to ensure the soundness of the enterprise, Article 25 also stipulates that the dividend cannot be issued when the company has no surplus or has losses, and may be appropriately reissued after making up for the losses in the year of surplus. Article 26 also stipulates the conditions for apportioning dividends before starting business, which can reassure investors.

　　As for the interests of the labor side, it is actually related to the capital side. Capital cannot be separated from labor, so a limited consideration of the labor side can improve the work, which is still beneficial to the capital side, and can also be said to protect investors. Therefore, Article 8 stipulates that "matters relating to the interests of both labor and capital shall be resolved through consultation between the labor-capital conference or between labor and capital." Article 25 also stipulates "improvement of safety and hygiene equipment fund, employee welfare fund and employee bonus."

　　China has a vast territory and a large population, making it the world's largest domestic market. The 475 million people account for one-quarter of all humanity. The daily necessities needed by one-quarter of all humanity are an incalculable amount. This incalculable amount of daily necessities is to be supplied by state-owned economy and private enterprises. Therefore, just in terms of domestic trade, private enterprises have a very large field. This field was mostly encroached upon or occupied by imperialism in the past. Now the People's Government controls international trade and is not afraid of the outflow of rights and interests. The national land reform will be basically completed between 1951 and the spring of 1952. By then, hundreds of millions of peasants will have their own gardens and gradually improve their living standards. Under the People's Government's "urban-rural mutual assistance" policy, even just a portion of the daily needs of farmers is enough for private enterprises to do. 1951 is just beginning, let's work hard quickly!

　　我对于私营企业暂行条例的看法
    陈叔通
    “发展生产繁荣经济”是建立社会主义的前提，是新民主主义时期经济建设的目标。我国生产落后，要达到社会主义还须经过相当长的新民主主义过程。在这过程中，发展生产须用各种不同的方式：“使各种社会经济成分在国营经济领导之下，分工合作，各得其所”，才可以促进整个社会的经济繁荣。所以私营企业是人民政府所要鼓励的，扶助的。解放前假繁荣时期是由于通货膨胀，物价不断高升，各企业与私人抢购货物，或囤积牟利，或存储备用，人人存着侥幸的心思，以投机为常事。这样，一般人固然困穷不堪，即投机者亦是内心日窘。所以在解放前人人有岌岌不可终日之势。人民政府以极大的魄力，在不到一年的光阴里，克服了十几年来的通货膨胀，建立了稀有的奇迹，使全国物价趋于稳定，人民生活亦渐渐安定下来。但是因为囤积者无利可图，争先出货，为投机而开办的事业本无基础，遂出现了产品滞销。又以劳资关系尚未改善，有纷纷停业的情形，这是那时不可避免的暂时现象。去年夏季以后人民政府又调整了工商业，各业始渐好转，私营企业遂逐渐增多。政府为鼓励这个趋势，而又要纳之于正轨，乃制定了私营企业暂行条例，而于去年年底颁布了。
    人民政府发展生产，繁荣经济的政策，是要“公私兼顾，劳资两利”的。私营企业条例是完全符合这个原则的。按照共同纲领第二十八条：“凡属有关国家命脉和足以操纵国民生计的事业，均应由国家统一经营”，这是当然的。在这个范围以外，按照共同纲领第三十条：“凡有利于国计民生的私营经济事业，人民政府应鼓励其经营的积极性并扶助其发展”。现在颁布的私营企业暂行条例，就是实行这一条的规定。条例（以下简称条例）第一条便说明了。我国工商业的组织有旧的独资与合伙，及新的股份公司等种种不同的方式，而全国约计一百三十多万工商业户，用新的方式的只有万余家，其余大都是旧的。所以条例第三条包括这些各种组织，都是要鼓励的，扶助的，并不以公司的组织为限，这是照顾全部私营企业的意思，为以前旧时代公司法所没有的。为解除投资人的顾虑，条例第八条规定“企业的财产和营业受充分的保护，经营管理权属于投资人”。又不但为开业复业着想，还在第十五条照顾到变更营业范围，添设分支机构，迁移地区，并还顾到转业、停业、复业、歇业、解散。为保护投资人利益，第九条规定如应国家迫切需要，或在技术上有重要的改进或发明，而在短时期不能获利者，并可有减税或免税的优待。同时又有第六条防止盲目生产之管制，是皆出于保护投资人利益的精神。第二十五条规定了利润的分配比例，公司组织的企业的盈余，提存公积金百分之十，这是为了要公司巩固。股东股息虽然限制不得超过百分之八，实际上向来股息亦尚不到此数；况且股东红利及董事监察人经理人厂长尚有酬劳金，一般不少于百分之六十之规定，由股东来决定其中的分配比例。为保护股东起见，除在许多条里有保障企业健全的各种规定外，第二十五条又规定了公司无盈余或有亏损时不能发给的股息，得于有盈余的年度弥补亏损后酌情补发。而二十六条还订有在开始营业前酌派股息的条件，这些都是可以使投资人安心的。
    至于劳方利益，实在是与资方有关系的。资本不能脱离劳动，故有限度的兼顾劳方，可以搞好工作，仍是于资方有利的，也可以说是保护投资人。故第八条规定了“与劳资双方利益有关者应由劳资协商会议或劳资双方协商解决之”。第二十五条又规定了“改善安全卫生设备基金，职工福利基金及职工奖励金等”。
    中国疆域广大，人口众多，为世界上最大的国内市场，四亿七千五百万人口占全人类四分之一。全人类四分之一所需要的日常用品，就是不可计算的数量。这个不可计算的数量的日常用品，是要国营经济和私营企业供给的。所以只就国内贸易说，私营企业就有极大的领域。这个领域在过去多为帝国主义所蚕食或霸占，现在人民政府统制了国际贸易，不怕利权外溢了。全国土地改革将于一九五一年至一九五二年春间基本完成，到那时三亿几千万的农民有了自己的园地，逐步提高了生活水准。在人民政府“城乡互助”政策下，单就农民日常需要的一部分说，也够私营企业做的了。一九五一年正在开始，大家赶快努力吧！
