　　Mass Economic Security Organizations and Railway Protection Organizations
    "Each economic construction department should, in a planned, step-by-step, and focused manner, organize a specialized team for preventing spies and counter-revolutionaries. Those that have already been established must be further strengthened. Without such a specialized team, it is impossible to fight against hidden enemies and achieve victory."
        —July 9, 1950, Editorial of this newspaper: "Strengthen Economic Security Work"
           Widespread Organization of Safety Groups in Industrial and Mining Enterprises
    In industrial and mining enterprises in the Central-South District, Hebei, and other areas, the method of widely organizing "safety groups" among the workers has been implemented. According to statistics from eight enterprises, including Wuhan Jiji Water and Electricity Company and Ferry Company, alone, 113 safety groups have been established, with 594 safety committee members. In seven major factories and mines in Hunan, safety group members account for 15% of the total number of employees. In addition to establishing safety groups, factories and mines in Hebei have also formulated regulations for regular inspections, shift handovers, and safety responsibilities. This mass-line approach to economic security work has played a significant role in preventing espionage and accidents. For example, special agents Cai Jinguo, who sneaked back to the mainland from Hong Kong to sabotage a coal mine in the Central-South District, and Liu Kui, who attempted to sabotage a gold mine in the Central-South District, were both uncovered by our economic security organizations before their sabotage plots could be carried out. In Shijiazhuang, accidents in all public enterprises (including Jingxing Coal Mine) in October of last year decreased by more than 65% compared to July. The vacuum machine safety group of Tangshan Power Plant has implemented the "diligent observation, diligent touching, and diligent listening" rule and has promoted the entire plant's workers to resolutely eliminate accidents, creating a new record of 107 days of safe power generation.
            Large-Scale Training of Economic Security Personnel
    In order to educate economic security personnel and train a large number of work cadres in this area, and to establish a strong specialized team for preventing spies and counter-revolutionaries, economic security staff training classes have been systematically established in various regions. Public security departments in various provinces and cities in the Central-South District have conducted rotational training for security personnel in various industrial and mining enterprises. Tangshan, Shijiazhuang, Jinan, Qingdao, and other places have also held similar training classes, conducting education on protecting machinery, anti-espionage, and how to organize the masses for security work. After receiving training, economic security personnel returned to their factories and promoted mass "fire prevention, theft prevention, bandit prevention, and anti-espionage" work among employees. For example, Zhang Zongcai, a member of the safety group of the Shijiazhuang Enterprise Company's egg factory, immediately stopped the engine and released steam when he discovered that the boiler had reached a high temperature of 40 degrees due to the second steam valve being closed, avoiding the danger of an explosion that would have occurred 20 minutes later. When a fire broke out in the Qinghua Factory of the private Da Xing Yarn Factory, members of the safety group of the thread cloth factory bravely assisted in putting out the fire. In addition, the worker pickets in the Zibo mining area of Shandong, and the safety groups of Baoding Power Plant and 205 Oil Factory, have strengthened day and night patrols, maintaining production safety.
            Organizing Railway Protection Groups Along Railway Lines
    To prevent bandits and special agents from sabotaging railway transportation, many railway workers have organized residents along the lines to protect the railway. For example, more than half of the Shanghai Railway Bureau's jurisdiction over lines such as the Shanghai-Nanjing, Shanghai-Hangzhou, and Zhejiang-Jiangxi lines pass through the mountainous new districts of Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces, which have sometimes been subjected to sabotage by a small number of lurking bandits and special agents. Since the bureau mobilized residents along the lines to protect the railway in June of last year, it has organized about 80,000 railway protection residents. Nearly 250 resident railway protection groups patrol and keep watch every night along the railway lines. The township chiefs and village chiefs of Shangrao Dahu Township have automatically taken the lead in patrols. As the flames of American imperialist aggression threaten our country and the railway has entered the winter defense period, the enthusiasm of residents for railway protection has become even higher. In the 170-kilometer jurisdiction of the Jinhua Public Security Section alone, 192 villages have organized more than 14,000 railway protection personnel. These railway protection personnel have also automatically established 141 guard sheds. Since the Kengkou Public Security Station of the Shangrao Public Security Section mobilized residents to protect the railway, no railway equipment has been lost in its jurisdiction. In September of last year, the Shaxi Public Security Station of the same section, in coordination with the resident railway protection group, captured three bad elements who stole rail spikes and seized more than 200 kilograms of rail spike screws. Masses along the Longhai, Jiaoji, and Jinpu railways have also organized railway protection groups. The railway protection groups in Donghai County, at the eastern end of the Longhai Railway, have formed 77 groups. In September and October of last year, they cracked three groups of bandits and special agents and investigated 14 cases of privately selling railway equipment. In Linzi and Changshan counties along the Jiaoji Railway, 144 villages have established security committees to strengthen the education and rectification work of the militia. Grain protection groups have also been established in places where the state stores public grain.

### 群众性的经济保卫组织和护路组织

　　群众性的经济保卫组织和护路组织
    “各经济建设部门要有计划有步骤有重点地组织一支防奸反特的专门队伍，已经建立了的，则须使之更加健全。没有这样的专门的队伍，就不可能同隐蔽的敌人作战，并取得胜利。”
        ——一九五○年七月九日本报社论：《加强经济保卫工作》
           工矿企业广泛组织安全小组
    中南区、河北等地的工、矿企业，实行了在工人群众中广泛组织“安全小组”的办法。仅据武汉既济水电公司、轮渡公司等八个企业单位的统计，就建立了一百一十三个安全小组，拥有五百九十四个安全委员。湖南七个主要厂矿中，安全组员占职工人数的百分之十五。河北各厂矿建立了安全小组外，并制订了定期检查、交接班和安全负责等制度。这种走群众路线的经济保卫组织工作，在防特和防止事故上起了很大作用。如从香港潜回大陆企图破坏我中南区某煤矿的特务分子蔡金国、企图破坏我中南区某金矿的特务分子刘奎等，均在其阴谋破坏之前，即为我经济保卫组织所破获。石家庄全市公营企业（包括井陉煤矿在内）去年十月份事故较七月份减少百分之六十五强。唐山市发电厂真空机安全小组，作到了“勤看、勤摸、勤听”的三勤规约，并推动了全厂工人，坚决消灭事故，创造了安全发电一百零七天的新纪录。
            大量培养经济保卫人员
    为对经济保卫人员进行教育并大量培养这方面的工作干部，建立一支坚强的防奸防特的专门队伍，各地并系统地开办了经济保卫工作人员训练班。中南区各省市公安部门，就对各工矿企业保卫人员进行了轮流训练。唐山、石家庄、济南、青岛等地，也都举办相同的训练班，进行保护机器反特务的教育及如何组织群众作保卫工作的教育。经济保卫工作人员受训练后回厂又推动了职工群众性的“防火、防盗、防匪、防特”工作。如石家庄市企业公司蛋厂安全小组组员张宗才，当他发觉因第二汽门关闭，锅炉高烧到四十度时，立即停车放汽，避免了二十分钟以后即爆炸的危险。私营大兴纱厂清花厂发生火警，线布厂安全小组的组员们，即奋勇协助把火扑灭。此外，山东淄博矿区的工人纠察队，保定市发电厂、二○五油厂等的安全小组，加强昼夜巡逻，维护了生产的安全。
            组织铁路沿线护路小组
    为防止匪特破坏铁路交通，不少铁路工作人员组织了沿线居民保护铁路。如上海铁路局管辖的沪宁、沪杭、浙赣等线，一半以上穿越浙、赣两省的山地新区，有时曾受少数潜藏土匪特务破坏。自去年六月该局发动沿线居民护路至今，已共组织起护路居民约八万人。铁路沿线每夜有近两百五十个居民护路小组巡查放哨。上饶达湖乡的乡长村长等都自动带头巡查。当美帝国主义的侵略火焰威胁我国，铁路又进入冬防时期后，居民的护路热情更加高涨。仅金华公安段一百七十公里辖区沿线，就组织起一百九十二个村庄的一万四千多个护路员。这些护路员并自动建立了一百四十一个守护岗棚。上饶公安段坑口公安所自发动居民护路后，辖区内从未丢失过铁路器材。同段沙溪公安所去年九月间在居民护路小组配合下，捕获盗窃道钉的坏分子三人，搜出道钉螺丝两百多斤。陇海、胶济、津浦等铁路沿线的群众也纷纷组织护路小组，陇海路东端东海县的护路小组已组成七十七个，在去年九、十月份中曾破获匪特三股，查获私卖铁路器材的事件十四起。沿胶济路的临淄、长山两县，已有一百四十四个村庄成立了治安委员会，加强民兵的教育和整顿工作。在国家储存公粮的地方并建立了护粮小组。
