Editor's Note: The Jinan Railway Factory and the Wafangdian Locomotive Depot Repair Shop, among other units, have been imposing unlimited overtime work, disregarding the health and safety of workers, and repeatedly causing various dangerous personal accidents in production. This practice is a serious violation of the labor policy stipulated in the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

The phenomena of harming workers' health and neglecting safety that have occurred in the above-mentioned units must be inspected and corrected. The local trade unions should firmly stand on the position of protecting the interests of workers and the interests of the state and conduct due supervision over the administrative aspects.

Jinan Railway Factory Continues to Have Personal Accidents

Since the Jinan Railway Factory launched the New Record Movement in September of last year, significant achievements have been made in production due to the increased awareness of workers and the unleashing of creative wisdom and labor enthusiasm. However, due to the factory leadership's lack of attention to safety work, serious personal accidents have occurred. From September 23rd of last year to January 15th of this year, a total of 46 accidents, large and small, occurred in less than four months. Among them, 14 were personal accidents caused by careless operation, and 5 were cases of workers being injured by smoke due to poor equipment.

The main reasons for these accidents are: First, the leadership is ideologically paralyzed and does not pay attention to safety education, only shouting empty slogans of "strengthening four preventions and eliminating accidents," but never specifically studying and arranging how to prevent accidents. When an accident occurs, only a few people from the reward and punishment section go to investigate, convene the responsible persons of the Party, government, trade union, and Communist Youth League to discuss the handling opinions, and then report to the bureau to complete the matter. For example, on September 23rd of last year, Song Shuquan of the Mechanical Factory accidentally touched the commutator during operation, causing the planer surface to slide and break the right arm of Song Baoren, a planer worker. This bloody lesson did not attract the attention of the factory leadership, and it was not used to educate all factory workers, resulting in continuous injuries and deaths. Second, the allocation of labor is inappropriate, and old, weak, sick, and disabled personnel are not properly reassigned. For example, Huai Xianghe of the Transportation Section had his waist and legs injured by a coal water truck, making it inconvenient to move. The unit supervisor knew about this but did not reassign him, so that on December 22nd of last year, he rolled from the slope of a coal pile into the bottom of a train while climbing onto the train, and his lower right leg was crushed by the wheels. Third, safety equipment is not perfect. In December of last year, safety personnel found that some electrical wires had no insulation due to prolonged use. However, the administration did not repair all of them in time, so that on January 15th of this year, Cui Tinglu of the Locomotive Depot was stepping on a two-millimeter seven-strand uninsulated welding wire while directing the crane to lift the boiler. He was electrocuted and fell onto the rails. Just as the train was starting, his left arm was crushed. He was sent to the hospital for treatment but died at noon the next day. Also, when moving the copper melting furnace in the Foundry Workshop, the ventilation equipment was not repaired in advance, and five workers were injured by smoke.

Wafangdian Locomotive Depot Repair Shop: Lack of Planning in Production, Overtime Work Exhausts Workers

In the patriotic production competition, the Wafangdian Locomotive Depot Repair Shop of the China Changchun Railway is simply increasing labor intensity and imposing unlimited overtime work, which has exhausted many workers and generally reduced product quality.

For example, the factory's contract repair team can complete the washing and inspection tasks of 18 locomotives per month according to the fixed number of employees. However, the actual task in December of last year increased by 33.3% compared to the bureau's quota. However, these task increases were not seriously initiated for workers to discuss and formulate various scientific methods, but only a few cadres above the foreman made plans and asked everyone to execute them. As a result, due to the large workload and few people, the task could not be completed, so they had to work overtime. This caused the workers to be excessively tired and affected their health. For example, on December 9th, 136 hours of overtime were worked on washing and inspecting locomotive No. 84. More seriously, on December 12th, when washing and inspecting locomotive No. 107, worker Hu Baoxian worked continuously for two days and nights repairing the air cylinder packing. In short, due to the administrative leadership's lack of planning for work and the failure to conduct democratic discussions when assigning tasks, they only mechanically worked overtime. As a result, in December, 335 hours of overtime were worked in washing and inspecting and minor repairs of nine trains. In November, nine workers were exhausted from overtime, and in December, the number increased to 32. Xu Tiancai and Che Yunlong had fainted due to excessively extended working hours. Liu Zhensheng and other workers were exhausted from overtime. Some workers even fell asleep while working. Many repair workers had swollen red eyes and were unwilling to eat.

When the deviation first occurred, the trade union cadres of the factory did not actively fight against this wrong phenomenon. They only thought that "now is the time for the anti-US aggression and aid Korea production competition, and the trade union should not emphasize the work system," thus promoting the development of this deviation.

Facts have proved that excessive overtime is not the correct method to improve production, but will cause both human and financial losses. The factory had 18 accidents in the past eight months. And 15 of them occurred in December. Among them, there were five responsibility accidents for major damage to out-of-stock products, and ten rework jobs (with major repairs).

Heilongjiang Hailun County Some Factories Violate Labor Policy and Harm Workers' Health Editor:

Recently, it has been discovered in Hailun County, Heilongjiang Province, that many factories do not comply with labor policies and do not pay attention to the health of workers. For example, the manager of the grass bag factory subjectively signed a two-month order contract with the Provincial Grain Bureau in January of this year without research by the factory management committee. As a result, it did not conform to the specific situation of the factory. Fearing that the task would not be completed, he ordered workers to work overtime for a long time. Most of the workers in the factory are female workers, young workers, and child laborers, and the production tools are heavy and the work is hard. Such overtime seriously hinders the health of the workers. Now most of the workers suffer from bronchitis. The sick workers are also not paid attention to medical treatment and care. Female worker Wang Guozhen usually works actively. Recently, due to gynecological diseases, she needs to rest for three or four days a month. Manager Zhao forced her to leave the factory. Workers in the County Trade No. 2 Rice Factory and the County Oil Mill work 12 hours a day. Recently, the County Federation of Trade Unions inspected 12 factories and found that many of the kang in the workers' dormitories were broken and could not be burned. The workers are very cold at night, and the factory does not find a way to solve it. The above situation is hoped to attract the attention of relevant departments.

Hebei Handan Farm Should Pay Attention to the Cold Protection Equipment in Workers' Dormitories

Editor: Hebei Provincial Handan Farm does not care about the suffering of the workers. It is now winter, and the ice and snow are on the ground. The workers' dormitories are bitterly cold, and they toss and turn all night, unable to sleep. The workers asked the dormitory to be equipped with fire, and the farm trade union asked the administration three times in a row, but they did not reply. The cadres' dormitories are either warm stoves or coal fires, with warm air rising, another world. In contrast, the workers are even more dissatisfied. The workers of the cotton ginning requested masks (because it is very harmful to the respiratory tract), but the farm firmly refused to reply, and asked the workers to provide them themselves. It is hoped that the above problems can be solved quickly by the administration.

Manager Liu Fengming, Who Beat His Fellow Workers, Was Sentenced to Two Months in Prison

Liu Fengming, manager of the privately-owned Mingxing Iron Factory in Yingkou City, often forced workers to work overtime and owed workers four months' wages and 38 days' overtime pay. Recently, he openly violated human rights and beat workers. On December 8th of last year, when worker Chen Shenggui was repairing a drill bit, Liu Fengming asked him to pour ashes. Chen Shenggui said, "Wait until the drill bit is installed before pouring." Liu moved his hands and punched Chen a few times. Chen Shenggui did not fight back, and poured the ashes. On the evening of the 26th, Liu Fengming asked Chen Shenggui to work overtime because he wanted to deliver textiles. Chen disagreed. Liu Fengming roared, "I told you to work overtime and you don't, and you're still mumbling." Then he kicked Chen's thigh. He then picked up a wrench from the lathe to hit Chen. At that time, Chen Shenggui told the trade union about this matter. In order to protect the interests of the workers, the trade union immediately filed a lawsuit with the court. After careful review by the court, it was announced that Liu Fengming was sentenced to two months in prison.

　　关心工人安全保护工人健康
    编者按：济南铁路工厂及瓦房店机务段修理厂等单位，在生产中无限制的加班加点，不顾工人的健康和安全，一再发生各种险恶的人身事故。这种作法，是严重地违犯了人民政协共同纲领所规定的劳动政策的。
    上述单位所发生的损害工人健康和忽视安全的现象，必须进行检查和纠正。当地工会应该坚决站在保护工人利益和国家利益的立场上，对行政方面进行应有的监督。
    济南铁路工厂连续发生人身事故
    济南铁路工厂自去年九月份开展新纪录运动以来，由于工人的觉悟提高，发挥创造智慧和劳动热情，生产上有了显著成绩。但由于该厂领导不重视安全工作，造成严重的人身事故。从去年九月二十三日起至今年一月十五日止，不到四个月间共发生大小事故四十六件。其中因操作不慎而产生的人身事故达十四件，因设备不良，工人被烟熏伤者达五件。
    产生这些事故的主要原因是：一、领导上思想麻痹，不重视安全教育，只是空喊“加强四防消灭事故”，对如何防止事故却从未具体研究与布置。发生了事故只是奖惩股的几个人跑去了解一下，召集党、政、工、团的负责人商讨处理意见，然后报局完事。如去年九月二十三日，机械厂宋书全因操作不慎，触动换向器，使刨床面滑动，将刨床工宋宝仁右臂锉断。这一血的教训并未引起工厂领导的重视，没有以此去教育全厂职工，致接二连三的继续发生伤亡事故。二、劳动力配备不适当，没有将老弱病残的人员适当调配。如搬运股怀相和腰部和腿部曾被煤水车撞伤，行动不方便。单位主管知道了并不给予调换，以致去年十二月二十二日在煤堆上爬车时由煤堆斜坡滚入车底，被车轮将右腿下部轧断。三、安全设备不够完善。去年十二月份安全人员在检查电器设备时，发现有些电线因用的过久已经没有包皮。但行政并未及时全部修理，以致今年一月十五日机车场崔廷禄在指挥天车吊锅炉时，踏着两米厘七股无包皮电焊线，触电跌倒在铁轨上，正值地车开动，将他的左臂轧断，送医院救治无效，第二天中午就死掉。又一次，铸工场移动熔铜炉时，事先不将通风设备修好，熏伤工人五名。

    瓦房店机务段修理厂  领导生产缺乏计划加班加点累病工人
    中长路瓦房店机务段修理厂，在爱国主义生产竞赛中，单纯提高劳动强度，无限制地加班加点，累病了很多职工，产品质量也普遍降低。
    如工厂包修组，按定员人数每月可完成十八台机车的洗检任务，去年十二月份实际任务较局定增加了百分之三十三点三。但这些任务的增加，并未认真发动工友讨论，订出各种科学办法，只由工长以上的少数干部做出计划，让大家执行。结果因活多人少，完不成任务，只好加班加点。这样就使工友们过度疲劳，影响身体健康。如：十二月九日，洗检八四号机车加班一百三十六个钟头。更严重的是十二月十二日，洗检一○七号机车时，胡保先工友修气筒盘根就一连工作二日夜。总之，由于行政领导上对工作缺乏计划，布置任务时不经过民主讨论，只机械地加班加点。结果，十二月份九台车在洗检和小修中，共加点三百三十五小时。十一月份因加班加点累病九名工友，十二月份就增多到三十二名。徐天财、车云龙曾因过度延长工作时间而昏倒了。刘振生等工友因加班累病。还有的工友一边干着活就睡着了。很多修车工友熬的眼睛肿红，不愿吃饭。
    偏向刚产生时，该厂工会干部没有积极向这种错误的现象做斗争。只认为“现在是抗美援朝生产竞赛时候，工会不应强调工作制度”，因而助长这一偏向的发展。
    事实证明，过度的加班加点不仅不是提高生产的正确方法，而且会使人财两伤。该厂在过去八个月中共出了十八件事故。而十二月份就占了十五件。其中，出库产品大破损的责任事故就有五件，反工活（有大修理）十件。

    黑龙江海伦县某些工厂  违背劳动政策损害工人健康编辑同志：
    黑龙江省海伦县最近发现不少工厂不遵守劳动政策，不重视工人的健康。如草袋厂经理今年一月未经工厂管委会的研究，自己主观地和省粮食局订两个月的订货合同。结果不符合工厂具体情况，因怕完不成任务，就命令工人长期加班加点。该厂工人大部分是女工、青工和童工，生产工具又笨重，工作吃力。这样加班严重妨碍工人的健康。现在工人中绝大部分都患气管炎。对有病的工人也不注意医治和照护，女工王国珍平日工作积极，最近因患妇女病，每月需休息三、四天。赵经理就强迫她离厂。县贸易二米厂和县油房的工人，每天工作十二小时。最近县总工会检查了十二个工厂，发现有九个工厂工人宿舍的炕很多都坏了不能烧。工人夜里很冷，厂方也不设法解决。以上情况希望能引起有关部门注意。

    河北省邯郸农场  应注意工人宿舍的防寒设备
    编辑同志：河北省立邯郸农场不关心工人疾苦。时值冬月，冰雪在地，工人宿舍寒风刺骨，辗转反侧失眠终夜。工人要求宿舍备火，场工会向行政一连要求三次，终未答复。而干部宿舍不是暖炉便是煤火，暖气腾腾，另一天地。相形之下，工人更为不满。工人轧花要求口罩（因损害呼吸气管很厉害），场方亦坚不答复，并叫工人自备。以上问题望行政上能迅速解决。

    殴打工友的经理刘凤鸣  被判处徒刑两个月
    营口市私营明兴铁工厂经理刘凤鸣，经常强迫工人加班加点，拖欠工人四个月的工资和三十八天加班费。近来更公然侵犯人权，欧打工人。去年十二月八日，工人陈生贵在修理钻头时，刘凤鸣要他去倒灰，陈生贵说：“等把钻头上好再倒。”刘动手就把陈揍了几下。陈生贵并未回手，而且还把炉灰倒了。二十六日晚，刘凤鸣因为要交纺织的定货，叫陈生贵加点。陈不同意。刘凤鸣就咆哮说：“叫你加点你不加，嘴还嘟囔。”接着便朝陈的大腿上踢了一脚。又从车床上操起搬子要打陈。当时陈生贵便将这件事告诉了工会。工会为了保护工人的利益，即向法院起诉。经法院慎重审查后，宣布判处刘凤鸣徒刑两个月。
