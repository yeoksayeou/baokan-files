　　Overseas Chinese Student Lin Aimei Thanks People's Postal Workers

Editor Comrades:
    I am an overseas Chinese student who grew up in Java and returned to the embrace of the motherland just half a year ago. The motherland has given me much warmth. As soon as I stepped onto the soil of the motherland, I received a warm welcome and hospitality, even better than returning to my own family. I am even more fortunate to be able to receive education at the people's Tsinghua University. The National Day parade and the Resist America, Aid Korea movement have all given me much education. Recently, there was another thing that moved me, which could only happen in today's era of the people under the leadership of Chairman Mao:
    My family sent me a medical reference book from Java. Only "Miss Lin Aimei, Beijing" was written on the wrapping, neglecting to write the address. After it was sent to Beijing, according to the regulations, it should have been returned since there was no address. However, our people's post office is so responsible. They knew that it was not easy to send things from Java. They searched everywhere for this, trying every possible way, and inquired at the Women's Federation and several schools. Finally, they went to the Overseas Chinese Returned Association three times to ask before they found me. This is such a great thing! They spent so much energy and time for such a book, determined to find me. Their spirit of work and care for us overseas Chinese are very worthy of our praise and learning. I would like to express my gratitude and respect to them!
    At the same time, I want to write back to tell my family and classmates to be careful when sending letters, not to neglect or write the address incorrectly, in order to reduce the difficulties for the comrades working in the People's Post Office.
        Lin Aimei

### 华侨学生林爱梅感谢人民邮政工作者

　　华侨学生林爱梅感谢人民邮政工作者编辑同志：
    我是生长在爪哇的华侨，投到祖国的怀抱刚半年。祖国给了我许多的温暖。我一踏上祖国的土地就受到热烈的欢迎与招待，比回到自己的家庭里还强。更幸运的是我能在人民的清华大学受教育。国庆节的大游行，抗美援朝运动这一切都给了我许多的教育。最近又有一件使我感动的事，这只有在今天毛主席领导的人民时代里才会有的：
    我的家从爪哇寄来一本关于医学的参考书。包皮上只写“北京林爱梅小姐收”，忽略了写地址。寄到北京后，没有地址照例是要退回的。但是我们人民的邮政，是那么负责。他们知道爪哇寄东西来很不容易的。他们为此东找西寻，想尽办法，到妇联和好几个学校去打听。最后，三次去问华侨归国联谊会，才把我找到。这是多么伟大的事呀！他们为了这么一本书，费尽了多少精力与时间，非把我找到不可。他们这种工作的精神，与对我们海外华侨的关怀，是很值得我们表扬与学习的。我特此向他们道谢与致敬！
    同时我要写信回去叫家里的人及同学朋友们，寄信时，要小心，别把地址忽略或写错。以减少人民邮政工作同志们的困难。
        林爱梅
