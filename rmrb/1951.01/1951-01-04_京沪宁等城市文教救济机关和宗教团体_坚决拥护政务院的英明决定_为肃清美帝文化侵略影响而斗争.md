[Reported by this newspaper] Cultural, educational, and relief organizations and religious groups in cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, Jinan, Hangzhou, Yangzhou, and Luzhou in Southern Sichuan, have expressed their opinions one after another, endorsing the Government Administration Council's decision regarding the handling of cultural, educational, and relief organizations and religious groups accepting American subsidies.

	Beijing
    The School Affairs Committee, Trade Union, and Student Union of Yenching University in Beijing jointly held a meeting on the afternoon of December 31, 1950, to discuss the Government Administration Council's decision and issued a declaration on behalf of all teachers, students, and staff. The declaration stated: "The People's Government's measure to safeguard the sovereignty of our national culture and education and oppose imperialist aggression is completely in line with the will of the Chinese people. In particular, all teachers, students, and staff of Yenching University, which accepts American subsidies, wholeheartedly support the wise decision of the People's Government." The declaration pointed out: "American imperialist elements, headed by John Leighton Stuart, may appear dignified and eloquent on weekdays, but when it comes to crucial moments, they ultimately expose their hideous faces of carrying out aggression for American imperialism." The declaration also stated: "Now that American imperialism's attempts at military aggression and political control over mainland China and Korea have failed, it has become enraged and is even attempting to threaten the lives of Chinese people working in American-subsidized institutions and to divide the unity of the Chinese people through the despicable means of freezing Chinese funds. This makes us even more clearly understand that there can be no leniency in the struggle against the enemy."
    The declaration concluded: "The awakened Chinese people will never again be deceived by American imperialism, and the Chinese people who have stood up will not be influenced by the enticements or threats of American imperialism. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, we will surely build our own undertakings with our own strength."
    Seven church middle schools in Beijing, including Bridgman Academy, Yu Ying School, Mu Chen School, Huiwen Academy, Chongshi School, Duzhi School, and Chongde School, said in a joint declaration: "We firmly support the decision of the Central People's Government Administration Council on the policy of handling cultural, educational, relief organizations, and religious groups accepting American subsidies, because that is a measure that an independent country should take, and it is a wise decision that is completely in line with the will and requirements of the Chinese people! We are determined to work hard for the early realization of this correct decision, and we must first make our schools become schools for the people of the motherland."

	Shanghai
    More than 100 faculty members of Shanghai's University of Shanghai, including Cai Shangsi, Chen Yanpan, and Yu Rixuan, and St. John's University, including Pan Shizi, Ni Baochun, and Lin Judai, issued written statements on the 31st, expressing their excitement and support for the Government Administration Council's decision on the 29th. They also decided to take practical actions to strive for the realization of new democratic education and the elimination of the poison of American imperialist cultural aggression.

	Nanjing
    Li Fangxun, acting president of the University of Nanking in Nanjing, said: "We firmly support Vice Premier Guo Moruo's report and are willing to make the greatest efforts to promote its realization." All teachers, students, and staff of the University of Nanking in Nanjing also sent a telegram to Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier Guo Moruo of the Central People's Government Administration Council, expressing their willingness to take practical actions to promote the early realization of the Government Administration Council's decision in the school. Wu Yifang, president of Ginling Women's College, issued a written statement saying: "Only a revolutionary government can make such a wise decision, and we extremely support it. Our school will run new democratic education well with the support of the People's Government." Gulou Hospital, which had been controlled by American imperialism through religion for more than 60 years, held a symposium. Chen Zuyin, the hospital's president, excitedly said: Gulou Hospital will truly serve the Chinese people in the future with the efforts of the people themselves. The Nanjing Branch of the China People's Relief Association firmly stated that it would implement the Government Administration Council's decision in a step-by-step manner to shatter the conspiracy of American imperialism to invade China in the name of "relief." Rev. Shao Jingsan, chairman of the Nanjing Christian Association, and Zhu Peien, general secretary of the YMCA, both believe that the Government Administration Council's decision is consistent with the spirit of the Christian Three-Self Patriotic Movement of self-government, self-support, and self-propagation. All democratic parties issued statements unanimously stating: We fully support the Government Administration Council's decision and will strive to completely realize this glorious task and completely eliminate the influence of American imperialist cultural aggression in China.

	Jinan
    Yang Dezhai, president of Cheeloo University in Jinan, said: "We firmly support the Government Administration Council's decision. We must thoroughly eliminate the influence of American imperialist cultural aggression." Zhang Huiquan, dean of the School of Medicine of Cheeloo University, also condemned American imperialist cultural aggression and supported the Government Administration Council's decision. Li Daohui, a 72-year-old Christian and vice chairman of the Jinan Christian Joint Council, said: Christians in New China have full confidence in achieving the goals of self-government, self-propagation, and self-support, and can completely break away from the control and influence of imperialism.

	Hangzhou
    Li Zhaohuan and Zhou Zheng, president and vice president of Hangzhou's Zhijiang University, said in a statement: "We firmly believe that the national cultural, educational, and relief organizations and religious groups accepting foreign subsidies and foreign-funded operations will respond to the call of the Government Administration Council, actively strive for self-reliance, and sever all relations with American imperialism." Qiu Jinling, president of the Hangzhou Christian Association, and Wang Zhongkang, secretary of the Hangzhou Christian Association, stated: Christians in the city must accept the leadership of the People's Government, sever all relations with imperialism, and run a Chinese church that is completely self-governing, self-propagating, and self-supporting.

	Yangzhou
    Religious circles, church schools, and church hospital personnel in Yangzhou also issued statements one after another in support of the Government Administration Council's decision.

Rev. Qin Shixiang of the Luzhou District Council of the Chinese Christian Church and Rev. Li Nonglian of the Independent Church both stated their full support for the Government Administration Council's decision, and they called on believers to implement the policy of "self-reliance, self-support, and self-propagation." Four hundred Catholics in Luzhou City expressed their heartfelt support for the Government Administration Council's decision. Priest Zhou Zhaoxian said: "The Catholic Church cannot be slaves to American imperialism simply because it relied on their money in the past. Today, American imperialism is using shameless means to threaten Chinese units receiving their subsidies, which we cannot tolerate." Four hundred Catholics in the city jointly issued a declaration calling on all Catholics in Southern Sichuan to support the Government Administration Council's decision with practical actions to express their determination to resist America and aid Korea.
