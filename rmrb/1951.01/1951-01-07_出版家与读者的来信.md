　　Publisher and Reader Letters
    Concerning the "New Compiled New Knowledge Dictionary"
    Letter from Shanghai Beixin Bookstore:
    "Regarding the "New Knowledge Dictionary" we previously published, after receiving criticism and guidance, we stopped selling all remaining copies and destroyed the printing plates. At the same time, we thoroughly revised it. Almost every entry went through several discussions and revisions. We also added many new materials and entries, and deleted many unimportant entries. After ten months of hard and conscientious work, it has now been renamed "New Compiled New Knowledge Dictionary" and has been published. We hope to continue to receive criticism and guidance so that we can make further improvements."
    Editor's Note: The responsible attitude of Beixin Bookstore towards its publications is commendable. This "New Compiled New Knowledge Dictionary" can generally meet current needs. To provide readers with a more complete dictionary, we hope readers will offer more criticism of the book. We also hope the publishing industry will make further efforts in this area.
    Concerning the "People's Science Series"
    Letter from Ge Yihong of Tianxia Publishing House:
    "The "People's Science Series" was first published in early 1947, edited by the Sino-Soviet Cultural Association Research Committee. At that time, seeing that Soviet science was rarely introduced domestically, we wanted to translate some popular books and periodicals to publicize the great achievements of the Soviet Union in this area. The progressive scientific methods of the Soviet Union and its correct direction of serving the people can serve as a reference for our scientific community and increase the public's understanding of the Soviet Union. However, because it was not easy to find people who were proficient in both science and Russian to do this work, we consulted with comrades Shi Zhi, Liang Xiang, and Shui Fu, and asked them to translate this series. In doing so, the translation inevitably has shortcomings. However, this work was significant before the national liberation. After reading the special article reviewing this series in "Book Review," I am deeply ashamed. I am willing, as the organizer of this series at the time and the current distributor, and having received the authorization of the translators, to declare that I accept the opinions raised in the article and will invite experts to carefully proofread and make every effort to improve."
   Re-printed Book Issues by Sanlian
    Li Bojin writes:
    "The "Das Kapital" published by Sanlian Bookstore in January 1950, the first Shanghai edition, is a complete reprint of the old edition of the Reading Publishing House, but with a few appendices added to each volume. The Reading edition was not carefully proofread and had many errors and omissions. The Sanlian edition naturally inherited all of them but has printed a separate list of errata, attached to the end of the supplement to Volume 1 of "Das Kapital," bound into a small booklet. The errata list has a total of thirty-three pages, with one thousand six hundred and fifty-eight errors. Other works published by Sanlian have also suffered from the same problem. As far as I know, the book "The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State" has only two hundred pages of text, but the errata list has four pages with more than eighty errors; the book "Fundamental Problems of Marxism" is missing an annotation for "Humanism" in the two-stroke radical of the noun index after the main text; and the "An Outline of Chinese Economy" published in May 1950, the first Shanghai printing, has a list of errata on the last page with pages 272 to 275, but the book ends at page 247, so I do not know what happened. Sanlian Bookstore is relatively serious in China, but such situations still exist, which shows that the publishing industry currently does not pay enough attention to proofreading work. Therefore, I sincerely hope that the publishing industry will take a serious and responsible attitude to do a good job in proofreading in the future."
    Editor's Note: Sanlian Bookstore made the following reply to Comrade Li Bojin's comments:
    "There were indeed many misprints in the past editions of "Das Kapital." Because it was difficult to reset the type for a while, we had to make a terribly long list of errata. Now that the old edition has been sold out, we have decided not to reprint it. The translator is also revising it, not only correcting the misprints but also correcting inappropriate translations. Two volumes have now been revised, and we have already sent them for typesetting. "The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State," "Fundamental Problems of Marxism," and "An Outline of Chinese Economy" are all reprinted using old printing plates. We also plan to revise and reset these books."
    Compilation and Printing of Government Orders and Document-related Books Should Be Serious
    Ding Chuanxin writes:
    "The "Taxation and Industry and Commerce" published by the Central and Southern Xinhua Bookstore compiles the Provisional Regulations on Industrial and Commercial Tax and Commodity Tax promulgated by the State Council in 1950 and several articles on taxation published in the People's Daily. In the "Tax Items" section on page 14 of the book, in addition to missing words and punctuation errors, the "concealed" turnover is mistakenly printed as "underreported" turnover on page 9; and the tax rate for sugar on page 15 is mistakenly printed as 30 percent instead of 20 percent. These cannot be said to be technical errors, because they involve tax rules and tax rates, which can have a bad influence on the dissemination of government orders and the understanding of the broad masses of readers. Secondly, I want to talk about another example of passing on errors. The article "On Standard Cost Accounting" is selected in both "Strengthening Economic Accounting System to Overcome Waste in Industrial Production" (Northeast Xinhua Publishing) and "Management Issues of Public Enterprises" (Dalian Northeast Bookstore Publishing). In this article, the materials quoted by both books have the same errors: In "How to Establish Standard Manufacturing Cost Charts," the standard operation time for the first manufacturing process of Product A should be 0.30, but is mistakenly printed as 0.36 in both books; the standard labor cost for the third manufacturing process should be 0.27225, but is mistakenly printed as 0.2725 in both books. These shortcomings may seem very small in themselves, but the impact is not small. And from this, we can illustrate another problem, that is: some editors have not been able to go through the original materials word by word and sentence by sentence. Therefore, we must be very cautious in compiling and printing government orders and documents and quoting original materials."

　　出版家与读者的来信
    关于《新编新知识辞典》
    上海北新书局来信：
    “我们过去出版的《新知识辞典》，承蒙批评指示后，我们一方面把全部存书停售，纸版销毁；一方面进行彻底改编。差不多每一条都经过几次讨论修改，同时又增加了很多新的材料和条目，删除了许多不重要的条目，经过十个月的辛勤、认真的工作，现改名《新编新知识辞典》，业已出版，希请继续批评指教，俾得再改进，为荷。”
    编者按：北新书局这种对出版品负责的精神是很好的。这本《新编新知识辞典》大体可以适合目前的需要。为了供给读者一本更完整的辞典，希望读者对该书多多提出批评，同时希望出版界对这方面的工作，作更进一步的努力。
    关于《人民科学丛书》
    天下出版社葛一虹来信：
    “《人民科学丛书》一九四七年初版，由中苏文协研究委员会主编。当时因见苏联科学在国内向少介绍，想翻译些通俗书刊，借以宣扬苏联在这方面的伟大成就。苏联进步的科学方法及其为人民服务的正确方向，是可以供我科学界参考和增加人民大众对苏联的认识的。但因不易找到兼通科学和俄语的人来做这一项工作，就向什之、梁香、水夫诸同志商量，请他们把这套丛书译了出来。这样做，译文自然难免有不周的地方。但是这个工作在全国解放以前是有它的意义的。近读《图书评论》评介这套丛书的专文，深为感惭。我愿以这丛书当时的组织者和现在发行者的资格，同时受了各译者的委托，声明接受该文所提出的意见，并当邀约专家，严加校勘，尽力设法改善。”
   三联重版书问题
    郦伯瑾来信说：
    “三联书店发行的《资本论》一九五○年一月上海第一版，是完全按照读书出版社旧版重印的，不过各卷增添了几篇附录。读书版校对不精，错漏很多，三联版当然全部承留下来、但已另印勘误表，附在《资本论》第一卷补遗后面，合订成一小册。勘误表共计三十三页，一千六百五十八条。三联发行的其他著作，也有患了同样毛病的。就我所知，《家族私有财产及国家的起源》一书，正本不过二百页，勘误表就有四页八十余条之多；《马克思主义的根本问题》一书，正文后名词索引二画里就漏了一条“人本主义”的注释；又如一九五○年五月上海造印第一版的《中国经济原论》，末页有一正误表，有二七二至二七五等页，但本书只到二四七页就完了，不知是怎么一回事。三联书店在国内还是比较认真的，尚且存在着这样的情形，可见目前出版界对于校勘工作实在太不重视。为此我诚恳地希望今后出版界以严肃负责的态度来搞好校对工作。”
    编者按：三联书店对郦伯瑾同志的意见，曾作了如下的答复：
    “《资本论》过去误植的确很多，因一时重排为难，故不得已作一长得可怕的刊误表。现在旧版本已经卖完，我们决定不再重印。译者并已在修改，不但改正了误排，还改正了不适切的翻译，现已改毕两卷，我们已经发排。《家族私有财产及国家的起源》、《马克思主义的根本问题》及《中国经济原论》均系用旧纸型翻印，这些书我们也打算订正重排。”
    编印政令文件性书籍应认真
    丁传信来信：
    “中南新华书店出版《税收与工商业》一书，汇集了一九五○年政务院颁布的工商业税、货物税暂行条例和人民日报登载过的几篇有关税收的论文。书中十四页“税目”一项内除文字脱漏、标点错误外，并在第九页内把“匿报”营业额，误植为“漏报”营业额；在第十五页内糖的税率百分之二十，误植为百分之三十。这决不能说是技术性的错误，因为它涉及税则、税率问题，对政令的传布上和广大读者群众的认识上，是可以起坏影响的。其次，我要谈到另一种以讹传讹的例子。《加强经济核算制克服工业生产中的浪费》（东北新华出版）和《公营企业的管理问题》（大连东北书店出版）两本书里都选入了《关于标准成本计算》一文。这篇文字中引用的材料，两书犯了同样的错误：在《如何订定标准制造工费图表》内，Ａ制品第一制造程序，标准作业时间应为○·三○，均误植为○·三六；第三制造程序，标准工费应为○·二七二二五，均误植为○·二七二五。这些缺点的本身看来似乎是很微小的，影响却并不小。而从这里就可以说明另一个问题，那就是：在某些编辑工作者对原始材料的审查上，还未能逐字逐句的认真去做。因此对于政令文件的编印和原始材料的引用都必须十分审慎才对。”
