Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 3rd (TASS dispatch): As previously reported, the Soviet government sent notes to the governments of France, the United States, and Britain on November 3, 1950, suggesting that a meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France be convened to consider the implementation of the provisions of the Potsdam Agreement regarding the elimination of German militarism. On December 22, 1950, French Ambassador Chataigneau, British Chargé d'Affaires Nicholls, and American Chargé d'Affaires Barbour visited Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Gromyko and presented similar replies on behalf of their respective governments.

The following is the French government's reply:

　　“Note from the French Government. December 22, 1950.

　　“The French Embassy in Moscow has the honor to acknowledge receipt of the note from the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs dated November 3, 1950. The note enclosed the full text of the declaration published in Prague on October 22, 1950, and suggested that a meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the United States of America, France, the United Kingdom, and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics be convened to consider the implementation of the clauses in the Potsdam Agreement regarding the elimination of German militarism.

　　“The French Government consistently adheres to the principle stipulated in the United Nations Charter that international issues should be resolved through peaceful negotiations. The French Government hereby reiterates its adherence to this principle. This is entirely in line with the spirit of the resolution adopted by the United Nations General Assembly and supported by the French Government, which specifies the necessity of holding consultations that would help ease the current international tensions. This resolution has no intention of aggression against the Soviet Union, but rather stems from a genuine desire to end the existing international tensions and will spare no effort to achieve this desired objective. It is prepared on the basis of the principles and methods proposed below, namely, to jointly explore with the governments of the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain the possibility of obtaining a mutually acceptable basis for a four-power foreign ministers' meeting.

　　“The French Government has carefully studied the Soviet Government's note of November 3, 1950. The French Government regrets to point out that the basis put forward in this note does not offer any real prospect of a solution. The problem of eliminating German militarism is not the cause of the current tensions. The only existing German army is the German army that has been equipped with artillery and tanks and trained according to military principles in the Soviet occupation zone for many months. If the participation of German troops in the defense of West Germany is indeed being discussed, it is only because the Soviet Union's policy has forced other countries facing terrible examples to discuss all methods of improving their own security. Contrary to the completely false assertions contained in the Prague communiqué, the French government and the British and American governments are determined not to allow West Germany to be used as a base for aggression at any time or under any circumstances. In view of the rearmament currently underway in East Germany, the French government cannot trust whether the situation in the part of Germany under Soviet occupation is the same.

　　“Moreover, according to the Prague communiqué, it is also impossible to obtain a fair solution to other aspects of the German question, The communiqué does not have any new or constructive features, and the proposed solutions have been rejected by most German public opinion. The communiqué is essentially a repetition of previous suggestions, which, after detailed study, have proven not to provide a basis for constructively resolving the German question. In order to end the current division of Germany, the French government, together with the US and British governments, has proposed more than once that the reunification of Germany be restored through free elections under international supervision. These suggestions were conveyed to the Chairman of the Soviet Control Commission by the three High Commissioners in letters dated May 25, 1950, and October 9, 1950. These letters have not yet been answered.

　　“The current serious tensions are not arising from the issue of eliminating German militarism, or even from the entire German question. These tensions arise primarily from the general attitude adopted by the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics since the end of the war, as well as the development of the international situation in recent months. If the four governments limit their discussions to the narrow basis suggested by the Soviet government, they will not be able to fulfill their entire responsibility. Issues related to Germany and Austria are clearly issues that should be discussed. However, the French government believes that any discussion should equally include the major issues, the resolution of which would enable a genuine and lasting improvement in relations between the Soviet Union and the United States, Britain, and France, and could eliminate the causes of the current international tensions throughout the world.

　　“The French government is willing to appoint representatives to join representatives of the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain to jointly study the issues mentioned in the previous section, in order to seek a mutually acceptable basis for convening a four-power foreign ministers' meeting, and to submit an appropriate agenda to their governments. The governments mentioned above all have representatives stationed at the United Nations headquarters in New York, which seems to be the most convenient location for conducting such exploratory consultations.

　　“The French government hopes to receive the Soviet government's opinions on the various suggestions put forward in this note.”

In response to the above notes, the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs has sent similar notes to the governments of the United States, Britain, and France through the embassies of the United States, Britain, and France in Moscow.

The following is the full text of the Soviet government's note to the French government dated December 30, 1950.

　　“The Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs has received the French government's reply of December 22 to the Soviet government's note of November 3 regarding the convening of a foreign ministers' meeting, and on behalf of the Soviet government hereby declares as follows.

　　“1. In its note of November 3, the Soviet government suggested convening a meeting of the Foreign Ministers of France, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union to discuss the implementation of the decisions of the Potsdam Conference regarding the elimination of German militarism. The Soviet Union put forward this suggestion not because it believed it was necessary to simply hold a four-power foreign ministers' meeting for the purpose of consulting on certain issues, but because it believed it was necessary to genuinely convene a foreign ministers' meeting to discuss some of the issues within the purview of the foreign ministers' meeting composed of certain members. At the same time, the Soviet government believes that it is necessary to first discuss the issue of eliminating German militarism, viewing this issue as the most pressing issue for Europe. On the one hand, the Soviet government still believes that the issue of eliminating German militarism is the most important issue concerning the guarantee of international peace and security, affecting the vital interests of the peoples of European countries, especially those who have suffered from the aggression of the Hitlerite bandits; on the other hand, the Soviet government also agrees to discuss other issues related to Germany, which is consistent with the Soviet government's position in its note of November 3 and the Eight-Nation Prague Declaration.

　　“The Soviet government does not object to the suggestion that representatives of France, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union hold preliminary meetings to draft the agenda for the foreign ministers' meeting. Needless to say, the task of such preliminary consultations does not include reviewing the issues that the four-power foreign ministers' meeting itself will discuss.

　　“Regarding the location for holding the preliminary meetings, the Soviet government suggests that such meetings be held not in New York, but in Moscow, Paris, or London, as holding such meetings in one of the aforementioned capitals would undoubtedly be of practical convenience to most participants.

　　“2. The French government's insistence that the suggestions put forward in the Prague Declaration cannot serve as the basis for a positive solution to the German question naturally surprises people, because this argument was issued before the four countries had considered the aforementioned suggestions. The French note's insistence that this suggestion has been rejected by the majority of the German people is, to say the least, without factual basis and does not conform to the actual situation. In any case, it is not difficult to see that the suggestions of the Prague Conference have received the deep sympathy of the broad masses of the German people (including the people of West Germany).

　　“As for the French government note's reference to the High Commissioners' letters to the Soviet Control Commission on the issue of holding all-German elections (these letters were nothing more than an attempt to evade issues of utmost importance to the German people), this issue has become a topic of repeated discussion between the four governments, and the Soviet Union's attitude towards this issue is well known.

　　“3. From the published materials, it is clear that the governments of the United States, Britain, and France are obviously establishing regular German troops in West Germany, not organizing some kind of police force as stated in the official statement of the three Western foreign ministers, but entire divisions of troops. It is also known that representatives of the governments of the United States, Britain, and France recently conducted negotiations with the Adenauer government to discuss establishing how many German divisions, even divisions equipped with tanks and heavy artillery, and to discuss the incorporation of these divisions into the so-called "unified army". Their measures to justify the necessity of strengthening the security of the United States, Britain, France, and other European countries are obviously unfounded, because no country has threatened these countries in the past, and no country is threatening them now. Even more unfounded is the French government note's attempt to justify the plan to remilitarize West Germany with the so-called rearmament of East Germany. Everything the French government note says about this point is a complete fabrication and completely inconsistent with the facts. The Soviet government pointed out in its note of October 19 that the three governments' statement is absolutely without any basis.

　　“4. The French government's note of December 22 gives us reason to believe that the French government agrees with the Soviet government's suggestion that the four countries jointly consider the issue of eliminating German militarism. The Soviet government attaches great importance to this point, because the realization of Germany's demilitarization is not only a provision in the Potsdam Agreement of the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, and France, but also the most important condition for guaranteeing peace and security in Europe, and is also in the interests of the German people themselves.

　　“At the same time, the whole world knows that recently it is the governments of the United States, Britain, and France that are taking various measures to re-establish the regular German army and restore West Germany's war industry, and they have already conducted formal negotiations with the Adenauer government on these issues, which reflects the attempt of certain aggressive groups to put an accomplished fact before the people of Europe. Needless to prove, the actions of the governments of France, the United States, and Britain are obviously in conflict with their obligations regarding the elimination of German militarism, and such actions cannot but create serious difficulties in resolving those issues that should be considered by the foreign ministers' meeting, the convening of which has been repeatedly postponed for some reason."

Similar notes have been sent to the British and American governments.

　　关于肃清德国军国主义的规定的问题
    苏联政府复照美英法三国政府
    主张履行波茨坦协定确保国际和平与安全
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科三日电：前已报道，苏联政府在一九五○年十一月三日曾照会法、美、英三国政府，建议召开苏、美、英、法四国外长会议，以考虑履行波茨坦协定关于肃清德国军国主义的规定的问题。一九五○年十二月二十二日，法国大使夏戴纽、英国代办尼扣斯，和美国代办巴波尔拜访苏联副外交部长葛罗米柯，代表各该国政府提出了内容类似的复文。
    以下是法国政府的复文：
    “法国政府的照会。一九五○年十二月二十二日。
    “法国驻莫斯科大使馆荣幸地收到苏联外交部在一九五○年十一月三日发出的照会。该照会附来一九五○年十月二十二日在布拉格发表的声明全文，并建议召开美利坚合众国、法兰西、联合王国和苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟四国外长会议，以考虑实施波茨坦协定中关于肃清德国军国主义各条款的问题。
    “法国政府始终不渝地遵守联合国宪章所规定的国际问题应以和平谈判来解决的原则。法国政府兹特重申它遵守此项原则。这一点完全符合联合国大会所通过并为法国政府所支持的决议的精神，这项决议指明举行有助于缓和目前国际紧张形势的协商之必要。这项决议绝无侵略苏联的意图，而是出于企图结束现存国际紧张形势，并将不遗余力达成为此渴望的目的的真实愿望。它是根据下面提出的原则与方式而准备的，即会同苏、美、英三国政府共同探求获致彼此可以接受的四外长会议的基础的可能性。
    “法国政府已经慎重地研究过苏联政府一九五○年十一月三日的照会。法国政府不得不遗憾地指出：在这个照会中所提出的基础，并未提供任何真正解决的前景。肃清德国军国主义的问题，并不是目前紧张形势的导因。目前存在的唯一德国军队，乃是许多月以来即已在苏联占领区内配备有大炮及坦克并依照军事方针训练的德国军队。假如德国部队参与西德防务一事果然正在予以讨论的话，那只是因为苏联的政策迫使其他面临可怖实例的各国不得不研讨改进其自身安全的一切方法。与布拉格公报中所包含的完全虚妄的断言相反，法国政府与英、美两国政府都坚决不允许在任何时候、任何情况下使西德作为侵略基地。鉴于前述现正在东德进行中的重新武装，法国政府不能信任在苏联占领下的一部分德国情形是否相同。
    “而且根据布拉格公报，要求得到德国问题的其他方面的公正解决也是不可能的。该公报中并没有新的或建设性的特点，其中所建议的解决方法已被大多数德国舆论所拒绝。公报实质上不过是重复以前的建议而已，该建议经详尽研究后业已证实并没有提供出建设性地解决德国问题的基础。法国政府为了结束德国目前的分裂状态，曾会同美、英两国政府不止一次地提出建议，主张以在国际监督下举行自由选举的办法来恢复德国的统一。这些建议曾于一九五○年五月二十五日和一九五○年十月九日由三国高级专员函达苏联管制委员会主席。这些函件迄未得到答复。
    “目前存在的严重紧张形势既不是从肃清德国军国主义的问题所产生的，甚至也不是从整个德国问题而产生的。这种紧张形势首先是因为苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟政府在战争结束以来所采取的一般态度，以及随之而来的国际形势最近数月的发展所产生的。如果四国政府把他们的讨论局限于苏联政府所建议的狭隘基础上，则它们的全部责任都将不能履行。与德国及奥地利有关的各项问题显然是应予讨论的问题。但是，法国政府认为任何讨论都应当同等地包括主要的问题，这些主要问题获得解决后，便能使苏联与美、英、法三国之间的关系得到真正与持久的改进，并且可以消除目前全世界国际紧张形势的原因。
    “法国政府愿意指派代表，会同苏、美、英三国政府的代表共同研讨上节所提到的问题，以便寻求一个彼此都能接受的召开四国外长会议的基础，并向他们的政府提出适当的议程。上述各国政府都有代表驻在联合国的会址纽约，这似乎是进行此种探讨性商讨的最便利的地点。
    “法国政府甚盼能接到苏联政府对此照会所提出的各项建议的意见。”
    在答复上述各照会的复文中，苏联外交部已经由美、英、法驻莫斯科大使馆以内容相似的照会分致该三国政府。
    下面是苏联政府一九五零年十二月三十日致法国政府的照会的全文。
    “苏联外交部已经接到法国政府十二月二十二日答复苏联政府十一月三日关于召开外长会议的照会的复文，本部兹代表苏联政府声明如下。
    “一、苏联政府在十一月三日的照会中建议召开法美英苏四国外长会议，讨论执行波茨坦会议关于肃清德国军国主义的决定的问题。苏联提出这样建议的出发点，并不是由于认为有必要仅仅举行单纯为了就某些问题进行谘商的四国外长会议，而是由于认为有必要真正召开外长会议来讨论由一定的成员所组成的外长会议职权范围内的一些问题。同时，苏联政府认为必须首先讨论肃清德国军国主义的问题，把这个问题看作是对欧洲最为迫切的问题。一方面，苏联政府仍然认为：肃清德国军国主义的问题是攸关确保国际和平与安全的最重要的问题，影响着欧洲各国人民、首先是受过希特勒匪徒侵略之害的各国人民的切身利益；另一方面，苏联政府也同意讨论有关德国的其他问题，这与苏联政府在十一月三日照会中所持的立场及八国布拉格声明是一致的。
    “苏联政府并不反对由法、美、英、苏四国代表举行预备会议以草拟外长会议议程的建议。无须说明，这种初步商谈的任务不包括审议四国外长会议本身所将讨论的问题。
    “关于举行预备会议的地点，苏联政府建议，这种会议不在纽约，而在莫斯科、巴黎或伦敦举行，这是由于在上述首都之一举行这种会议无疑地对大多数与会者会有实际的便利。
    “二、法国政府硬说布拉格声明所提出的建议不能作为积极解决德国问题的基础，这种论调很自然地引起人们的惊讶，因为这种论调是在四国还没有考虑上述建议以前发出的。法国照会硬说这种建议已为大多数德国人民所拒绝，这种论调至少可以说是没有事实作根据，而且是不符合实际情况的。无论如何，不难看到：布拉格会议的建议已得到广大的德国人民（也包括西德人民在内）的深切同情。
    “至于法国政府照会中所谓高级专员曾就举行全德国选举问题致函苏联管制委员会等语（这些函件无非是要规避对德国人民极其重要的问题罢了），这个问题已成为四国政府之间一再讨论的题目，而且苏联对这个问题的态度是众所熟知的。
    “三、从已发表的材料看来，美、英、法三国政府显然正在西德建立正规的德国军队，不是组织如西方三国外长的正式声明里所说的某种警察部队，而是整师整师的军队。大家也知道，美、英、法三国政府的代表最近曾与阿登纳政府进行谈判，商讨建立多少个甚至拥有坦克和重炮等装备的德国师，并商讨了将这些师并入所谓‘统一军队’的问题。它们的这些措施要以所谓有加强美、英、法和欧洲其他国家的安全的必要为口实来予以掩饰显然是毫无根据的。因为过去没有任何国家威胁这些国家，现在也没有任何国家在威胁它们。更加毫无根据的是，法国政府照会中企图以所谓东德也在重整军备的说法来为西德重新军事化的计划辩解。法国政府照会中关于这一点所说的每一件事都彻头彻尾是捏造的，与事实完全不符。苏联政府在它十月十九日的照会中就已指出：三国政府这种说法是绝对没有丝毫根据的。
    “四、十二月二十二日法国政府的照会，使我们有理由相信法国政府同意苏联政府所提出的关于四国共同考虑肃清德国的军国主义问题的建议。苏联政府对于这一点非常重视，因为实现德国的非军国主义化，不仅是美、苏、英、法波茨坦协定中的规定，并且是保证欧洲和平与安全的最重要的条件，也符合德国人民自己的利益的。
    “同时，整个世界都知道，最近正是美、英、法三国政府在采取各种措施重新建立德国的正规军与恢复西德的战争工业，而且它们已经与阿登纳政府就这些问题进行正式的谈判，这反映了某些侵略集团企图把既成的事实摆在欧洲人民面前。无须证明，法、美、英三国政府的这种行动显然是与他们关于必须肃清德国军国主义的义务相冲突的，这种行动在解决那些应由外长会议来考虑的问题上不能不造成严重的困难，而外长会议的召开由于某种原因已一再推延。”
    类似的照会已送给英国和美国政府。
