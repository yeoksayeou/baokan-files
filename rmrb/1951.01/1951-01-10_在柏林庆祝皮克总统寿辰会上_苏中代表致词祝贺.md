[New China News Agency dispatch] Berlin—A celebration was held in Berlin on January 3rd to celebrate the 75th birthday of Wilhelm Pieck, Chairman of the German Socialist Unity Party and President of the German Democratic Republic. Foreign delegations from the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the Republic of Poland delivered congratulatory speeches at the meeting.

　　Kuznetsov, head of the Soviet government delegation, said: The Soviet delegation, on behalf of the Soviet government and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, on behalf of the head of the Soviet government and the leader of our party, the great Stalin, and on behalf of the Soviet people, extends to you, Mr. President, warm congratulations on your 75th birthday, a glorious milestone in your life.

　　You are the first president of the German Democratic Republic. The establishment of the German Democratic Republic marks a turning point in European history.

　　The young German Democratic Republic, led by you, has achieved remarkable success in economic and cultural development and in building a democratic German state since its birth. The achievements of the German Democratic Republic encourage all German people to strive for a unified, independent, democratic, and peace-loving Germany.

　　The existence of a German democratic state in the heart of Europe, striving to maintain peaceful and friendly relations with all other peace-loving countries, is a powerful factor for peace and international security.

　　In response to the heinous actions of the warmongers, the German people, under the banner of the National Front, will intensify their efforts to achieve German unification, to achieve a swift and just peace treaty, and to consolidate world peace. All peace-loving peoples are eagerly hoping that the German people will achieve complete success in all these endeavors.

　　You have dedicated more than fifty years of your life to the struggle for the cause of the working people.

　　During the most difficult periods of the German people's existence, you, together with Thälmann—the outstanding leader of the German Communist Party—led the German working class and the entire progressive camp in the struggle against the aggressive forces of German imperialism, against the tyranny of the Hitlerite gang, to defend the freedom of the German people, and for friendly relations with the peoples of other countries.

　　Your invaluable experience in the struggle for the unity of the German working class, and your selfless devotion to the great ideals of Marxism-Leninism, have earned you the universal respect and love of the German people, have made you the leader of the progressive forces of the German people, and the head of the pioneering democratic German state. Your illustrious name encourages the German working class and all working people to further struggle for the establishment of a unified, peace-loving, and democratic German state.

　　The Soviet people are well aware of your uncompromising struggle against all enemies of peace, democracy, and socialism. The Soviet people see in you a long-tested and unwavering fighter who is fighting for peace and the security of all peoples, and for strengthening the friendly relations between the German people and the various peoples of the Soviet Union.

　　On the occasion of your seventy-fifth birthday, the Soviet delegation is honored to extend to you our heartfelt congratulations and hopes that you will have a long and healthy life for the happiness and prosperity of the German people.

　　The Soviet delegation wishes you, Mr. President, and all the German people further success in the struggle for a unified, independent, democratic, and peace-loving Germany.

　　Long live the German Democratic Republic and President Pieck!

　　Long live the friendship between the German people and the peoples of the Soviet Union!

　　Ji Pengfei, head of the diplomatic mission of the People's Republic of China, on behalf of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, emphasized in his congratulatory message Pieck's contributions to the struggle for peace, national unity, and democracy.
