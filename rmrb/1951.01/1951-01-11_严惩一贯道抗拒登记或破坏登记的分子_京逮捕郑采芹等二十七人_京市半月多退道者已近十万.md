[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] Beijing Public Security Bureau arrested twenty-seven Yiguandao leaders on January 9th, including Zheng Caiqin, Yang Shaofeng, and Li Fuyu (all transmitters who stubbornly refused to register with the government and sabotaged registration work), Liu Zhentian, Feng Derong, Zhao Ziguang, and Liang Guiqing (all altar masters), and Xue Quan, Si Lianglu, Tian Yu, Zhao Wencheng, and Zhai Shixian (who continued to engage in sabotage activities after false registration).

Since the Beijing Municipal People's Government issued the proclamation banning the Yiguandao on December 19th of last year, the masses who were deceived into joining the Yiguandao have quickly awakened after government propaganda and education, and have declared their renunciation of the sect. As of January 8th, the number of people who have declared their renunciation has reached 98,214. Many followers who have suffered from the Yiguandao have filed complaints with the government about the crimes of the Yiguandao and have assisted the government in banning the sect. Many transmitters, altar masters, and "three talents" in the Yiguandao have also repented and reformed, and have registered with the government. As of January 8th, 2,855 people have registered, many of whom have personally exposed the reactionary crimes and deceptive tricks of the Yiguandao. However, some transmitters, altar masters, and "three talents" still refuse to repent and stubbornly resist the government, refusing to register and even sabotaging registration work, or continuing to engage in sabotage activities after false registration. For example, altar masters Liu Zhentian and Chen Zhongkun resisted registration by feigning illness or acting deaf and dumb. Altar masters Chen Xuzong, Li Yumin, Yang Shaofeng, and Li Fuyu (also a transmitter) not only did not register, but also called on followers to hold meetings or used other methods to prevent followers from renouncing the sect, and intimidated the masses who renounced. Altar masters Si Lianglu and Tian Yu had to register after the masses confronted them with irrefutable evidence, but they were extremely dishonest during registration, pretending to know nothing, acting confused, and playing the rogue, refusing to hand over the "Three Treasures," and threatening the followers they led after returning, saying "No one is allowed to hand over the real Three Treasures." Altar master Zhao Wencheng held a grudge against his nephew Zhao Zhenshan (a follower) for pointing him out in the complaint, and after registering, he often verbally abused Zhao Zhenshan and threatened and intimidated Zhao Feimin, who had renounced the sect. Altar masters Tang Yaoxi and Feng Derong, among others, have committed murder and are still hiding and refusing to register. The masses hate these counter-revolutionaries who dare to refuse registration or conduct false registration and continue to engage in sabotage activities, and have reported them and demanded that the government arrest them and bring them to justice. In order to thoroughly ban the Yiguandao and uphold the law, the Beijing Public Security Bureau arrested them on January 9th based on the demands of the citizens. (Publicity Department)

　　严惩一贯道抗拒登记或破坏登记的分子
    京逮捕郑采芹等二十七人
    京市半月多退道者已近十万
    【京市新闻处讯】京市公安局于本月九日将抗拒政府坚不登记并破坏登记工作的一贯道点传师郑采芹、杨少峰、李馥芋等，坛主刘振田、冯德荣、赵子光、梁贵庆等及假登记后继续进行破坏活动的薛泉、司良禄、田玉、赵文成、翟士贤等二十七人予以逮捕。
    自京市人民政府于去年十二月十九日发布取缔一贯道的布告以来，被欺骗加入一贯道的群众，经政府的宣传教育后，都很快觉悟过来了，纷纷声明退道，到本月八日止，声明退道的即达九万八千二百一十四名。许多曾受过一贯道害的道徒纷纷向政府控诉一贯道罪行，并协助政府进行取缔一贯道的工作。一贯道中的点传师、坛主、三才等也多悔过自新，进行登记，到本月八日止已进行登记的有二千八百五十五名，其中有许多人并亲自揭发一贯道的反动罪行与骗人的技俩。但有一部分点传师、坛主、三才们仍然不知改悔，竟抗拒政府，坚不登记，甚至破坏登记工作，或假登记后继续进行破坏活动。如坛主刘振田、陈忠昆以装病不起，装聋卖傻的方式抗拒登记。坛主陈绪宗、李于民、杨少峰、李馥芋（兼点传师）等不但不进行登记，并号召道徒开会，或用其他各种方法，阻止道徒退道。对退道的群众加以恫吓。坛主司良禄、田玉等经群众对证后，证据确凿，不得不进行登记，但在登记时，极不老实，一问三不知，装糊涂，耍无赖，坚不交出“三宝”，回去后并威胁他所领导的道徒“不准交真三宝”。坛主赵文成对其侄赵振山（道徒）在控诉中指出了他，怀恨在心，登记后经常辱骂赵振山，威胁恫吓退道的赵飞民。坛主唐耀西、冯德荣等都曾有过人命案，至今隐蔽拒绝登记。对于这些胆敢拒绝登记或进行假登记，仍继续进行破坏活动的反革命分子，群众恨之入骨，纷纷检举并要求政府逮捕法办，京市公安局为根据市民要求，为彻底取缔一贯道，维护法纪，乃于本月九日予以逮捕。（公宣）
