　　Moscow Tool Factory
    Zhou Libo

    Comrade Nesto, the director of the Moscow Tool Factory, told us: When the poet Tikhonov came to visit the factory, he saw the vast gardens here and said with a smile, "I don't know if the park is attached to the factory, or the factory is attached to the park?"

    The poet's feeling is correct. If it weren't for the sounds of the workshops and the smoke from the chimneys, it would truly be a quiet garden.

    Comrade Nesto and the Party Secretary accompanied us along a wide path in the "garden" to their office. Portraits of Stalin, Molotov, and Voroshilov hung on the walls here. In the corner of the room were two dazzling red award flags. The Ministry of Heavy Industry and the Central Trade Union Council had awarded the title of collective Stakhanovite to all the employees of this factory, and awarded these two flags. In the Soviet Union, award flags are glorious prizes.

    The director took out a chart, pointed to it, and told us about the factory's history over the years. The war did not fulfill the German invaders' desire to destroy this factory. When the fascists approached Moscow, the factory moved to the East. After the enemy was driven away, the eastern factory was not moved. Only a small number of cadres were separated, and a branch factory of the same size as the original factory was established at the original site in Moscow. In this way, one factory before the war became two factories after the war.

    Most of the factory's employees stayed in the Urals, and some joined the army to defend Moscow, some of whom died heroically. When this factory was added, a large number of new workers were recruited, including young students and housewives. These men and women, who had never been near machines and lacked industrial knowledge, needed vocational education. The factory's experts fulfilled their responsibilities. Today, the factory has skilled workers, Stakhanovites, and capable staff. With their concerted efforts, production has already exceeded pre-war levels. Now, the number of workers in the factory is 98 percent of that in 1940, the number of engineers and technicians is 90 percent of that in 1940, and the number of staff is only 40 percent of that in 1940, but production is three times that of pre-war levels. This means that there are fewer employees than before the war, but more production than before the war. The production of some tools has increased by 15, 20, or 25 times compared to 1940.

    It must be said that this is an amazing achievement. How can this be? The director and the Party Secretary spoke in detail about this, because they believe that the new China is building new factories and restoring factories, and their experience can serve as a reference for us. They said: One of the reasons why there are fewer people and more production is, of course, due to the excellence of the machines; however, no factory makes things by itself, but workers make machines produce. Lenin and Stalin both said that people are the most important, and cadres are the country's valuable wealth. Therefore, they have done a lot of work for people and for cadres. First and foremost, the most important thing is that the factory has established its own specialized schools and vocational schools, so it can cultivate its own talents in batches without any restrictions. The more technical staff that are trained, the better the production. Secondly, political education has been strengthened. This makes workers, staff, engineers, and technicians understand that there is a new relationship between them, that they are not working for capitalists, but for the honor of the country and for the happiness of millions of ordinary people. The result of strengthening political education is that all the employees of the factory have become politically cultivated people, who not only understand the meaning of their efforts today, but also see the prospects for tomorrow's development, and see the road to communism. Employees with such a clear political mind can happily and actively fulfill the obligations that the state wants to give them. Third, a beautiful living environment has been arranged. Around the factory, the gaps between workshops are full of shady trees, green lawns, and beautiful flowerbeds. After work, the workers can take a walk in the garden, read newspapers under the trees, chat on the grass, in a word, get full rest in the fresh air and beautiful open air, and then return to the lathe with vitality as fresh as the air, working hard and with high efficiency.

    Getting good rest is for the sake of going to work well again.

    The factory club's facilities are also very complete. It has a cinema, gymnasium, amateur music team, amateur drama team, as well as radio facsimile and other modern cultural and entertainment equipment.

    The employee dormitories are tall and bright buildings. Inside there are bathrooms, gas, and telephones. Almost every worker's home has a radio. The dormitory has a medical clinic, which is like a small hospital. It has ten treatment departments, as well as electrotherapy equipment. Workers and workers' families can go to see a doctor for free. In addition, there is also a sanatorium in the factory. In order to educate the workers' children, the factory establishes summer camps every summer, which can accommodate three hundred children.

    Due to the careful measures taken in technology, politics, and life in various aspects, the workers' production enthusiasm has been universally and persistently high. They consciously develop their creative talents and bravely carry out selfless labor. They not only work step by step, but also actively, proactively, and overfulfill the tasks stipulated in the national plan. They not only complete today's affairs today, but also exceed the work that each person should do in the plan this year and next year. Due to the universal and conscious labor of the employees, the Moscow Tool Factory completed the new five-year plan in three years and seven months.

    The director talked about the progress of the factory's implementation of the five-year plan, and also talked about socialist competition. The competition is very extensive, and all employees, including the director, enthusiastically participate. The Soviet government pays great attention to socialist competition, because through it, workers' work can be quickly improved, and through it, the country will accelerate towards a communist society. The Party and the Trade Union guarantee to mobilize all employees to participate in the competition.

    The winners of the competition, the employees who have made extraordinary achievements in labor for the country, are not only valued by the factory, but also valued by the country. They have all been elected into the national leading organs. They are the heroes of the workshops and also the political leaders. This factory has twelve representatives from the District Soviet to the Supreme Soviet, and an excellent worker named Bolin was elected as a representative of the Supreme Soviet Court Committee.

    In the Soviet Union, the winners of the Stalin Prize are highly respected figures among the people. This factory had five Stalin Prize winners last year, one of whom was an ordinary worker, two skilled workers, and the other two were technicians.

    In their work, the employees of this factory are all brave and strive to be the first. They are collective Stakhanovites. In addition to giving the entire factory an award flag, the Supreme Soviet also gave 450,000 rubles to reward their contribution to the country. In addition to giving an award flag, the Central Trade Union Council also gave 300,000 rubles to reward their contribution to the working class.

    While talking to us, the director and the Party Secretary accompanied us to visit various parts of the factory. After leaving the office and walking onto the gravel road, we saw many wooden boards erected on the green grass under the linden trees, with neatly written slogans posted on them. The slogans are often changed. Whatever the task, under whatever conditions, the slogans are changed accordingly. Now, we see these two slogans:

    "Remember, your obligation in production is your obligation to the motherland."

    "For new technology."

    Between the slogans, there are also many portraits of heroes. These portraits are also often changed.

    Why are the portraits of heroes often changed? I was thinking about it when Comrade Nesto, as if knowing the questions in our hearts, immediately explained to us, and his words were educational:

    "Life is moving forward, and heroes cannot stop moving forward. Whoever only thinks the past was good, and is now lagging behind, his portrait will be taken down and replaced with the portraits of new, forward-moving people. Due to self-esteem, comrades who have not done their job well often do their job well."

    Look, people cannot stagnate. Life is flowing non-stop. Whoever is complacent and does not move forward, his portrait will be taken down in public and placed in the hazy corner of people's memory, until it is completely forgotten.

    We walked into a workshop. We only saw the machines turning non-stop, and the people operating non-stop. What beautiful and sturdy machines they are! They are truly huge machines in the Russian style. These are automatic lathes coated with grass-green paint. New lathes can be made from these lathes. In another room, male and female workers were sitting at rectangular work tables, adding some work to the manufactured items, either polishing cylindrical shafts or screwing in a screw. After each person completes their production action, they put the manufactured product on the flowing conveyor belt and let it flow to the second person. After the second person completes their work, the conveyor belt sends the manufactured product to the third person. This is a one-by-one transmission. Each person's actions are related to the others. This ever-rotating electric conveyor belt connects all production actions. In this way, all the workers' operations are interconnected. If you stop working, you will not only delay your underling, but also affect all the other workers who are manufacturing this part. In this way, the workers work non-stop under interconnection and mutual constraint.

    We turned to another workshop, which is the workshop for increasing the hardness of tools. We looked at the published achievement table here, and also saw a skilled worker publishing a new technology that he had recently explored in writing, telling other workers. In a socialist country, workers have never been unwilling to tell others about their technology. In order to move towards a communist society, workers work hard and create new industrial achievements, gain new experiences and technologies, and immediately tell others about these new experiences and technologies so that everyone can succeed. They all compete with each other, but their competition is socialist in nature. For the sake of socialist today and communist tomorrow, workers have no selfish intentions towards companions with the same goals.

    Here, the director said with a smile: Chinese comrades can tell each other whatever they need to know. From his words and smiles, we deeply felt the kindness and warmth in the international democratic family, and deeply felt the Soviet working class's love for the Chinese people. It is a pity that none of us understand industry. Otherwise, we would have learned a lot during this visit.

    We came out of the workshop and went to the sanatorium. It can accommodate thirty people for recuperation, but now there are only two people. Soviet people are strong and healthy, and their family life is very comfortable. When it is their turn to recuperate, they often do not come. We sat in the rest room and chatted, and wrote our feelings in the inscription book. Here, on the wall, hangs a portrait of Lenin in hunting attire. Lenin loved to hunt. His hunting was entirely for the purpose of working better, to restore and maintain abundant energy to handle the major events of the revolution.

    We visited the various facilities of the sanatorium and also went to the bright and clean dining room. The principal of the factory's specialized school was having a meal in the dining room. While we were walking out of the sanatorium, we talked about the specialized school and the issue of combining theory with practice. In addition to its own school, this factory also has connections with thirty schools. It has long-standing relationships with the Academy of Sciences, medical schools, electrical universities, and art schools. Some schools have maintained their relationship with it for ten to fifteen years. When answering the question of why this is done, the director and the Party Secretary said: The Party requires this. According to the Party's instructions, schools cannot be separated from reality, and factories cannot be without theory. Without theory, the work of the factory cannot be improved. The factory hopes that the school will solve theoretical problems, and the school hopes that the factory will provide practical experience. They depend on each other and cooperate with each other. This is the normal relationship between the factory and the school.

    We arrived at the dormitory, where workers and staff live together. In Soviet factories, the lives of mental laborers and manual laborers are gradually no longer clearly demarcated. Naturally, the division of labor is still very clear and very detailed. Everyone is in their own position, fulfilling their responsibilities to the motherland. First of all, do your best, and then take what you deserve. Those with one point of heat will emit one point of light, and those with three points of heat will never emit only two points of light.

    We went to the residence of a female planning director. Her husband died gloriously in the Patriotic War. A portrait of her respectable deceased husband hangs on the wall beside the desk. The room is clean and tidy. The new carpet shows her affluent life, and a grand piano shows her love and cultivation of music.

    It was almost noon, and the hostess asked us to have a simple meal. We chatted casually during the meal. The guests and hosts frequently raised their glasses. For the health of Stalin and Chairman Mao, for the prosperity of the Soviet Union, and for the industrialization of China, we stood up several times to toast.

    Slightly drunk, we said goodbye. The factory sent two of its own products: a metal meter ruler and a new type of caliber measuring instrument. This is the expression of the Soviet working class's love for the Chinese people. Because they love China, they show warm and fraternal feelings towards ordinary Chinese comrades like us.

　　莫斯科工具工厂
    周立波
    莫斯科工具工厂的厂长聂斯托同志告诉我们说：诗人吉洪诺夫到厂里来参观的时候，看见这里的广阔的园林，笑着说道：“你们这里不知道是公园附属于工厂呢，还是工厂附属于公园？”
    诗人的感觉是对的。这里要是没有车间的响声和烟囱的冒烟，真像一座幽静的花园。
    聂斯托同志和党委书记陪同我们沿着“花园”里的一条宽阔的走道，来到他们的办公室。这里的墙上挂着斯大林、莫洛托夫和伏罗希洛夫的画像。屋子的一角，放着两面红得耀眼的奖旗。重工业部和工会中央曾把集体的斯达哈诺夫运动者的称号授予这个工厂的全体职工们，并且奖了这两面旗子。在苏联，奖旗是光荣的奖品。
    厂长拿出一份图表来，指着它，为我们谈起了工厂历年的概况。战争没有依照德寇的毁坏这工厂的意愿。法西斯逼近莫斯科的时候，工厂移到了东方。赶跑了敌人以后，东厂没有动，只分出了一小部分干部，在莫斯科原址又建立了一个和本厂的规模一样大小的分厂。这样，战前一个厂，战后变成两个了。
    厂里的职工，大部都留在乌拉尔，还有一些，在保卫莫斯科时参加了军队，有的英勇牺牲了。添建这厂时，招收了大批新工人，其中有青年学生和家庭妇女。对于这些从来没有接近过机器，缺乏工业知识的男女，需要进行业务的教育。厂里的专家们尽了自己的责任。今天，工厂里有了熟练工人，有了斯达哈诺夫运动者，还有干练的工作人员。凭着他们一致的努力，生产已经超过战前的水平。现在，工厂里工人的人数，是一九四○年的百分之九十八，工程师和技术人数为一九四○年的百分之九十，职员只有一九四○年的百分之四十，但是生产品却三倍于战前。这就是说，职工比战前少，生产却比战前多。有些工具的生产，和一九四○年相比，已经增加了十五倍、二十倍、或二十五倍的产量。
    不能不说，这是惊人的成绩。怎么能够这样呢？厂长和党委书记在这方面说得很详细，因为他们认为新的中国正在新建工厂和恢复工厂，他们的经验正可作为我们的参考。他们说：人少而生产多的原因之一，固然是由于机器的精良；但是，任何工厂都不是机器自己在制造东西，而是工人使机器生产。列宁、斯大林都曾说过，人最重要，干部是国家的宝贵的财富。因此，他们对于人，对于干部，做了许多的工作。首先第一点，也是最重要的一点，工厂里设立了自己的专科学校和职业学校，因此，能够完全不受限制的成批的培养自己的人材。技术工作人员训练得越多，生产就越好。其次，加强了政治教育。这就使得工人、职员、工程师和技术人员懂得他们之间是一种新的关系，他们不是为资本家工作，而是为了国家的荣誉，为了千千万万的老百姓的幸福而工作。加强政治教育的结果，使得全厂职工都变成了政治上有修养的人，他们不仅懂得今天努力的意义，而且看清了明天发展的远景，看清了走向共产主义的道路。有着这样清醒的政治头脑的职工，就能愉快地、主动地履行国家要给予他们的义务。第三点，安排了优美的生活的环境。工厂的周围，车间与车间之间的隙地，到处是成荫的树林，碧绿的草地，和美丽的花圃。工人们在散工之后，可以到园子里散步，在树荫下看报，在草地上谈天，一句话，在空气新鲜，景色优美的露天底下，取得充分的休息，然后带着和空气一样新鲜的活力，回到车床的旁边，辛劳地、有着高度效率地工作。
    取得很好的休息，为的是再去很好地工作。
    工厂俱乐部的设备，也很完善。这里设有电影院、体育馆、业余音乐队、业余话剧队，还有无线电传真和其他种种现代文化的文化娱乐的设备。
    职工宿舍是高大敞亮的楼房。里面有浴室、瓦斯和电话，差不多每个工人的家里都有收音机。宿舍有个医务所，等于一个小小的医院。它有十个治疗科，还有电疗的设备。工人和工人的家属都能免费去医病。此外，工厂里还有一个休养所。为了教育工人的子弟，工厂每年夏天成立夏令营，那里能容三百个儿童。
    由于在技术、政治和生活种种方面的用心周到的措施，职工们的生产情绪普遍地持久地高涨着。他们自觉地发挥创造的才能，奋勇地进行忘我的劳动。他们不只是按部就班地工作，而且是积极地、主动地、超额地完成国家计划规定的任务。他们不只是今天做完今天的事情，而且在今年、明年都会超过计划里各人要做的工作。由于职工们的这种普遍的、自觉的劳动，莫斯科工具工厂在三年又七个月中间，完成了新五年计划。
    厂长谈起了工厂里实行五年计划的进度，又谈到了社会主义的竞赛。竞赛非常的广泛，所有的职工，连厂长在内，都热烈地参加。苏维埃政府非常注意社会主义的竞赛，因为通过它，工人的工作可以很快地提高，通过它，国家将加速地走向共产主义的社会，党和工会保证发动全体职工都参加竞赛。
    竞赛的胜利者，为国家立了劳动奇功的职工，不但为工厂所看重，更为国家所器重。他们都被选入了国家的领导机关里去。他们是车间的英雄，又是政治的领袖。这个工厂有十二位从区苏维埃到最高苏维埃的代表，有一位名叫波林的优秀工人，被选为最高苏维埃法院委员会的代表。
    在苏联，斯大林奖金的获得者是人民之中很受尊敬的人物。这个工厂去年有五个斯大林奖金获得者，其中一个是普通的工人，两个熟练工人，另外两个是技师。
    在工作中，这个工厂的职工人人奋勇，个个争先，他们是集体的斯达哈诺夫运动者。最高苏维埃除了给予全厂一面奖旗外，还给了四十五万卢布，奖励他们对于国家的贡献。工会中央除了给予一面奖旗外，也给了三十万卢布，奖励他们对于工人阶级的贡献。
    厂长同志和党委书记一面和我们谈论，一面陪着我们参观工厂的各处。出了办公室，走上碎石路，只见青草地上，菩提树下，竖立许许多多的木板，上面张贴着字迹工整的标语。标语是常常更换的。有什么样的任务，处在什么条件之下，便更换什么样子的标语。现在，我们看见这样的两条：
    “记着，你在生产上的义务，就是你对祖国的义务。”
    “为了新技术”。
    标语之间，还有许多英雄的画像。这些画像也常常掉换。
    为什么英雄肖像也常常掉换？我正在想着，聂斯托同志好像知道我们心里的疑问似地，立即为我们解释，他的话是有教育意义的：
    “生活向前走，英雄们不能停步不前。谁要光是从前好，现在老落后，就把谁的画像取下来，换上新的前进的人们的肖像。由于自尊心，没有做好工作的同志，往往就把工作做好”。
    看吧，人是不能停滞不前的。生活在不停不息地奔流，谁要是骄傲自满，不往前面走，谁的画像就会在大庭广众之中被摘下来，摆进人们的记忆的蒙胧的角落里，以至于全部被遗忘。
    我们走进一个车间。只看见机器不停地转动，人们不停地操作。这是怎样漂亮的、结实的机器呵！是真正的俄罗斯气派的巨大的机器，这些都是涂着草绿色的油漆的自动大车床，从这些车床上，可以造出新的车床来。另外一间，男女工人们坐在长方形的工作台子边，在制造物上，每人加点工，或是磨光圆柱形的轴，或是旋进一个螺丝钉。每一个人在完成自己的生产动作之后，就把制造品放在流动的输送带子上，让它流送到第二个人的跟前，第二个人做完他的一份工作之后，输送带又把制造品送到第三个人面前。这样一个挨一个的传递。每一个人的动作都和其余的人有联带的关系，由这流转不停的电动的输送带把一切生产动作都联结起来。这样，所有工人的操作都互相关联。你要是停工，不但会耽误你的下手，而且会影响制造这机件的所有其余的工人。这样，工人在互相关联，互相制约之下，不停的工作。
    我们又转到另一个车间，这是增加工具硬度的车间。我们看了这里公布的成绩表，也看了一个熟练工人把他自己新近摸索到的一桩新技术，用文字公布出来，告诉其他的工人，在社会主义国家里，工人对自己的技术从来没有不愿告人的。为了迈向共产主义的社会，工人们尽心尽力地劳动，创造新的工业的成果，获得新的经验和技术，并且把这新的经验和技术立即告诉旁的人，使大家都得到成功。他们都互相竞赛，但他们的竞赛是社会主义性质的，为了社会主义的今天和共产主义的明天，工人们对于怀着同样目地的同伴，没有任何私心的存在。
    在这里，厂长笑着说：中国同志需要知道什么，他们都可以相告。我们从他的说话和微笑里，深深地感受了国际民主大家庭里的亲切和温暖，深深地感到苏联工人阶级对于中国人民的友爱。可惜的是我们这几个人都不懂工业。要不然，就是在这次参观里，也会学到好多东西的。
    我们从车间出来，到了休养所。这里可容三十人休养，但是现在只有两个人，苏联人都身强力壮，家庭生活又非常的舒适，轮到他们休养，也往往不来。我们在休息室里坐着谈天，并且在题字本上写了我们的感想。这里墙壁上，挂着列宁的猎装像，列宁是爱好打猎的，他的打猎，完全是为了工作得更好，为了恢复和保持充沛的精力来处理革命的大事。
    我们参观休养所的各种设备，也到了明亮清洁的餐室。工厂的专科学校的校长正在餐室里用饭。我们一面走出休养所，一面谈起了专科学校，也谈到理论与实际联系的问题。这个工厂除了自己的学校外，还和三十个学校有联系。它和科学院、医学院、电气大学、艺术学校，都有历史悠久的关系，有些学校和它的关系已经维持十年到十五年。在回答为什么这样做的问题的时候，厂长和党委书记说：党要求这样。根据党的指示，学校不能够离开实际，工厂不能够没有理论。没有理论，工厂的工作就不能提高。工厂希望学校来解决理论问题，学校希望工厂提供实际的经验，彼此依存，互相配合，这就是工厂和学校的正常的关系。
    到了宿舍，这里工人和职员同住着，在苏联的工厂里，脑力劳动者和体力劳动者的生活渐渐的没有十分明显的界限了，自然，分工还是十分明确而且十分细密的。各人都在自己的岗位上，尽他对于祖国的责任。首先是各尽所能，然后才是各取所值，有一分热，发一分光，有三分热的人，决不只发两分光。
    我们到了一位女计划主任的寓所。他的丈夫在卫国战争中光荣牺牲了。书案傍边的墙上挂着她的可敬的亡夫的遗像。房间里收拾得干干净净，新的地毯显示了她的生活的宽裕，一架大钢琴显示了她对音乐的爱好和修养。
    快到中午，女主人留我们便饭。席间随便闲谈着。宾主频频举杯，为了斯大林和毛主席的健康，为了苏联的强盛，为了中国的工业化，我们几次站起来干杯。
    在微醉里，我们告辞了。厂里送了两样自己的出品：一只金属米突尺和一个新式的口径测量器，这是苏联的工人阶级热爱中国人民的表现，由于爱中国，他们对于像我们一样的普通的中国同志，都表现着亲如手足的热烈的情感。
