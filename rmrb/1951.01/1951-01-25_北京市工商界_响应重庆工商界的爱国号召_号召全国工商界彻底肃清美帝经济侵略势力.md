Xinhua News Agency, 24th: In response to the patriotic call of the industrial and commercial circles in Chongqing to actively pay taxes, the preparatory committee of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce sent a reply letter to the industrial and commercial circles in Chongqing on the 23rd, and at the same time called on industrial and commercial operators across the country to "thoroughly eliminate American imperialist economic aggression forces in China." The content of the reply letter is as follows: Friends in the industrial and commercial circles of Chongqing:

After suffering severe devastation and looting by the Chiang Kai-shek/American bandit gangs during their defeat, you were greatly weakened, but you were still able to overcome all difficulties and gloriously complete the annual tax revenue task for 1950 on New Year's Eve. This is truly worthy of our deep sympathy and admiration!

Beijing was liberated earlier. After a long period of learning and personal experience, industrial and commercial operators throughout the city have long recognized that imperialism and its running dog, the Kuomintang reactionaries, are obstacles and deadly enemies to the development of our industry and commerce. Only under the protection and support of the people's own regime can we truly achieve recovery and development. Therefore, we regard actively paying taxes as a glorious obligation to love and support our own government. In 1950, as in 1949, we successfully completed our tax obligations and called on industrial and commercial households throughout the city to quickly establish and improve accounting systems so as to gradually reduce the scope of democratic appraisal, so that national tax revenue can be better guaranteed, and the tax burden on industry and commerce can be more rational.

Now, in order to resolutely oppose American imperialism's aggression against our country's Taiwan and neighboring Korea, industrial and commercial operators in our capital, in addition to demonstrating, protesting, and working hard to support the front, have also written to Chairman Mao to guarantee that they will step up production, actively pay taxes, stabilize prices, and improve urban-rural trade, as a concrete manifestation of practicing the patriotic pact.

Finally, we hope that industrial and commercial operators across the country will closely unite under the victorious banner of Mao Zedong, smash the enemy's economic blockade, thoroughly eliminate American imperialist economic aggression forces in China, and jointly strive to build an independent, autonomous, and prosperous new democratic economy!

　　北京市工商界
    响应重庆工商界的爱国号召
    号召全国工商界彻底肃清美帝经济侵略势力
    【新华社二十四日讯】为响应重庆市工商界踊跃纳税的爱国号召，北京市工商业联合会筹备委员会于二十三日向重庆市工商界发出回信，同时号召全国工商业者“彻底肃清美帝在华经济侵略势力”。回信内容如下：重庆市工商界的朋友们：
    你们在惨遭蒋美匪帮溃败时的严重摧残和洗劫元气大伤之后，仍能克服一切困难，于一九五○年除夕光荣的完成了全年度的税收任务，实在值得我们深切的同情和钦佩！
    北京解放较早，全市工商业者经过长期的学习和亲身的体验，早已认清帝国主义及其走狗国民党反动派是我们工商业发展的障碍和死敌，惟有在人民自己政权保护和扶植之下，我们才能够真正得到恢复和发展，因此把踊跃纳税，看成是热爱和拥护自己政府的光荣义务。我们在一九五○年也和一九四九年一样，胜利的完成了纳税义务，并且号召全市工商业户从速建立与健全会计制度，以便逐渐缩小民主评议范围，使国家税收更有保证，工商税负更趋合理。
    现在我们首都工商业者为坚决反对美帝国主义侵略我国台湾和邻邦朝鲜，除了示威抗议努力支前之外，并已上书毛主席保证加紧生产，踊跃纳税，稳定物价，搞好城乡贸易，以为实践爱国公约之具体表现。
    最后望我全国工商业者，紧密的团结在胜利的毛泽东旗帜之下，粉碎敌人的经济封锁，彻底肃清美帝在华经济侵略势力，为建设独立自主繁荣的新民主主义经济而共同奋斗！
  　　　　　　　　北京市工商业联合会筹备委员会
    一九五一年一月二十三日
