　　"Resist America, Aid Korea" Tractor
　　Wu Gang

　　On December 17, 1950, the city of Taiyuan saw an extremely exciting piece of good news – the first crawler tractor was born. It was named "Resist America, Aid Korea".

　　At 1 p.m., this newly born tractor, adorned with red silk and flowers, was paraded for a ten-kilometer maiden voyage, cheered on by workers' waist drum teams and many other workers. It roared out of the Shanxi Machine Company, heading towards the provincial government. After inspection by Acting Chairman Pei Lisheng and Secretary of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Lai Ruoyu, it went directly to the industrial exhibition section of the Shanxi Industrial and Agricultural Exhibition.

　　Making a brand-new tractor is a significant achievement in Shanxi's production history, and it is also a rare event nationwide. Half a year ago, the Shanxi Provincial Machine Company could not even make simple waterwheels well. Now, it has successfully produced a tractor. At first hearing, it seems like a miracle. However, the manufacturing process of this tractor shows people that the great Chinese working class has endless wisdom and power.

　　The Shanxi Machine Company, which specialized in producing munitions for the bandit阎锡山 (Yan Xishan) before liberation, faced many difficulties after liberation when it switched to producing agricultural implements. At the start of the project, workers disassembled an old tractor and drew blueprints, but they immediately discovered many insurmountable difficulties. The first was the lack of equipment to manufacture important parts. Even more difficult was that no one knew what tools to use. However, the Factory Management Committee and the Tractor Manufacturing Committee under its direct leadership absorbed and concentrated the wisdom of all employees and launched a resolute battle against all difficulties.

　　Without exception, every tool was modified by the workers to adapt to the new product. When people saw Yuan lathe operator Bu Wenhua – this former munitions worker – turning out eccentric shafts, they felt it was a mythical miracle. Originally, the eight cam-shaped protrusions on an iron shaft each had their own direction and angle. Filing them hard with a file while clamped in a vise was both labor-intensive and uncertain. If the angle of even one of them was filed off by a slight amount, it would have to be thrown into the scrap pile. After Bu Wenhua came up with a solution, he added parts to the Yuan lathe and clamped the original sample on the Yuan lathe, following the original to guide the movements, which was both labor-saving and reliable.

　　Ironworkers in the iron casting department used hammers to forge wrought iron into various blanks to replace cast steel. Some parts that could not be forged in one go were forged into two or three pieces and then welded together. However, wrought iron goods are not as strong as cast steel goods after all, so the employees of the iron casting department overcame this difficulty by using the "carburizing" method. They made blanks from pure iron, added ingredients, and heated them in a muffle furnace to harden the surface after it absorbed carbon. But even so, some could be forged with a hammer, while others, like wheels, could not be forged with a hammer. Foundry workers overcame this new difficulty again. After their experiments, they cast the parts with 30 percent steel and 70 percent recycled iron. When foundry workers cast cylinders, in order to eliminate pinholes in the finished product, they repeatedly remade them fourteen times, finally finding the accurate chemical composition for the mixture. The difficulties that kept appearing were overcome by the workers, and victories also kept appearing: the difficult-to-make water tank, the transmission oil baffle...all were successfully completed one after another. In the end, all 5,000-plus parts, except for a few, were successfully made in-house.

　　One victory after another constantly gave the workers new excitement; until the installation, the workers' excited and nervous mood reached its peak. People anxiously waited for the final answer: can our tractor really be used? The installation site was bustling with people asking questions day and night. Finally, when this complete tractor appeared in the factory square, panting like a toddler learning to walk, from slow to fast, from unable to turn to being able to turn flexibly, all the workers were relieved. When they saw the first tractor, which was the result of their five months of hard work and wisdom, they couldn't help but cheer "Long live!"

　　The workers of the Machine Company strengthened their confidence in building the motherland with the successful trial production of the first tractor, and unfolded an infinitely bright vision for the future of industrialization.

　　This 25-horsepower tractor, because it is a crawler type, has a larger contact surface with the ground, so it is best suited for loose soil, wet soil, and slopes, and it requires less space to turn, which is suitable for farmland conditions. When dragging two bottom plows, it can plow ten *shimu* (approximately 1.65 acres) of land per hour.

　　Countless visitors touched this first tractor affectionately while visiting the industrial exhibition. The workers were confident that they could supply the peasant brothers with modern production tools. The peasants who came to visit said excitedly: Our future happy life cannot be separated from the support of our worker brothers.

　　抗美援朝号拖拉机
    吴钢
    一九五零年十二月十七日的太原市，出现了一个极其兴奋的喜讯——第一部链轨式拖拉机诞生了。它被命名为“抗美援朝号”。
    下午一时，这部新诞生的拖拉机被披红插花，在工人腰鼓队和许多工人的欢呼簇拥下，作十公里处女驶。它呜隆隆地由山西机器公司开出来，驶往省政府前，经过裴丽生代主席、中共山西省委书记赖若愚的检阅后，直开到山西工农业展览会的工业展览部展览。
    做成一部崭新的拖拉机，在山西的生产史上是重要的成就，从全国说来，也还是罕见的事。半年前连简单的水车都做不好的山西省机器公司，现在居然成功地生产出拖拉机，初听起来，简直是奇迹。然而，这部拖拉机的制造过程，向人们表明：伟大的中国工人阶级有着无穷尽的智慧和力量。
    在解放前专门为阎匪锡山生产军火的山西机器公司，解放后改产农具，是有许多困难的。在开工的时候，工人们拆开一台旧式拖拉机，绘制图样，但立刻就发现许多无法克服的困难，首先是没有制造重要机件的设备。更困难的是谁也不知道该用什么工具去做。但是，工厂管理委员会及其直接领导的拖拉机制造委员会，吸收和集中着全部职工的智慧，向所有困难展开了坚决的搏斗。
    每一件工具，无一例外的为适应新产品，被工友改装了。当人们看到元车匠卜文华——这个旧日的军火工人旋出偏心轴的时候，都感到是神话般的奇迹。原来一根铁轴上的八个桃形圪塔，各有各的方向和角度，夹在虎钳上用锉刀硬锉，既费工又没把握，只要其中的一个角度锉得稍差一丝，便要扔到废品堆里去。经卜文华想出办法，在元车上增加了零件，把原来的样品卡在元车上，依照原样指挥动作，既省工又有把握。
    铸铁部铁工用铁锤将熟铁打成各种毛坯，代替铸钢。有些不可能一次打成的零件，就打成两块、三块，再电焊起来。然而，熟铁货究竟不如铸钢货结实，铸铁部职工用“渗炭”办法克服了这困难。他们把纯铁打成毛坯，配料到焖火里加热，使它吸收炭素后表面硬化。但即使这样，有的能用锤子打成，有的像车轮还是不能用锤子打成的。翻砂工又克服了这一新的困难。经过他们的试验，以百分之三十的钢加百分之七十的回炉铁，便铸成了。翻砂工铸造汽缸时，为了消灭成品沙眼，直翻复做过十四次，终于摸到准确配料的化合成份。不断出现的困难都被工友们克服了，胜利也不断出现：难做的水箱、传动机的油档……都相继成功了。最后全部五千多零件，除个别的以外，都自制成功。
    一个接一个的胜利，不断给工友以新的兴奋；直到安装时，工人们兴奋的紧张心情，达到了顶点。人们焦急地等待最后的回答：我们的拖拉机真能用吗？安装的现场上日夜穿梭似地来往着探问的人群。最后，当这部完整的拖拉机出现在工厂的广场上，像幼儿学步似地，喘着气由慢而快，由不能转弯到能灵活转动时，全厂工友才放了心。他们看到那凝结着他们五个月来辛苦劳动和智慧的第一部拖拉机制成时，不禁欢呼万岁！
    机器公司的工人以其试制第一部拖拉机的成功事实增强了建设祖国的信心，并为工业化前途展开了无限光明美景。
    这部二十五马力的拖拉机，因系链轨式，故与地面接触面较大，松土、湿土、坡地最能表现其优越性，而且转弯时所需地位较小，适合耕地条件。拖带两底犁一台，每小时可耕地十市亩。
    无数的观众在参观工业展览时，亲切地抚摸着这第一部拖拉机。工人们都自信能供给农民兄弟以近代化的生产工具。前来参观的农民们兴奋地说：咱们将来的幸福生活，离了工人老大哥的支援，是不行的。
