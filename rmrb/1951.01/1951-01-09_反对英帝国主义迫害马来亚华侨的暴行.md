The Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang Issues a Statement
Condemning British Imperialism for Persecuting Overseas Chinese in Malaya
[Reported by this newspaper] The Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang today issued a statement condemning the crimes of British imperialism in persecuting overseas Chinese in Malaya.

The statement expressed full support for the Foreign Ministry spokesperson's statement and demands: the British government and the Malayan colonial authorities should immediately cease their policy of persecuting and expelling overseas Chinese, immediately release all overseas Chinese in Malayan concentration camps, ensure the safety of their lives and property, freedom of residence, and all other legitimate rights and interests, and compensate them for all losses suffered due to illegal persecution.

The statement concluded by expressing warm support for overseas Chinese in Malaya and committing to a sustained and effective struggle against the cruel persecution of our patriotic overseas Chinese by imperialism.

Returned Overseas Chinese Arriving in Shantou Accuse British Imperialism of Atrocities
Expressing Desire to Join the Volunteer Army to Resist America and Aid Korea
[Reported by this newspaper] The first two groups of Malayan refugees, totaling 1,300 people, who were unreasonably deported by British imperialism and arrived in Shantou on October 9th and 24th of last year, held an accusation meeting in a certain location in Chaoyang on December 19th to denounce the atrocities of British imperialism.

Upon their safe arrival in the homeland, the refugees immediately received warm condolences and care from the People's Government and people's organizations from all walks of life. They deeply thanked Chairman Mao, Director He Xiangning of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, the People's Government, and their compatriots for their concern. At the accusation meeting, they stepped forward one after another to accuse the British colonialists of their bestial atrocities, unanimously and resolutely expressing: to transform anger into strength and settle the blood debt with the British imperialists!

Comrade Zheng Zijing, chairman of the meeting, pointed out in his speech: Malaya has prospered on the blood, sweat, and bones of overseas Chinese. However, British imperialism has treated overseas Chinese with persecution after persecution. After the British colonial authorities announced the fascist "Emergency Regulations" on June 18, 1948, the lives and property of overseas Chinese were subjected to daily and hourly abuse and destruction. Entire villages were bombed and burned by British imperialism. Large numbers of overseas Chinese were arrested and killed! Tens of thousands of men, women, old, and young were driven out of the homes they had created with their own hands. These bloody debts, our compatriots, the more than two million overseas Chinese in Malaya, and the entire Chinese people will never forget!

Male and female refugees successively and sorrowfully made accusations. Zeng Guilian, who was shot six times by British soldiers and still has bullets in her body, was the first to stand up and accuse: in April 1949, British imperialism "cleaned up" the villages of Sungai, Kajang, in Selangor. Two hundred houses were burned down, more than three hundred people were left homeless, and twenty people were driven into concentration camps. Three overseas Chinese women, including Chen Jinfang, were gang-raped by large numbers of beast soldiers. Chen Jinfang committed suicide by jumping into a river after being humiliated. In November 1949, the beast soldiers burned down more than 400 houses and a coffee plantation in the village of Ya Chi, Kajang, leaving countless villagers homeless.

Tailor Zheng Guiyu cried until her eyes were red and swollen, hoarsely accusing of her experience of being ravaged by twelve beast soldiers. She gritted her teeth and shouted: "I want to accuse the whole world! I want revenge!"

Huang Mukun, Cai Jiawan, and more than twenty others accused with tears and clenched fists, the fire of anger and revenge burning in their chests! They said in unison: "Demand the blood debt from imperialism! Join the Volunteer Army to resist America and aid Korea, and crush the aggressive forces of imperialism!"

At the accusation meeting, thirty-two people, including Huang Zhiming, Huang A'an, and Yu Minsheng, signed up to join the army on the spot. Huang Zhiming said: "In order to wash away the new and old hatred, and to consolidate the national defense of the motherland, we must unite more closely and resolutely oppose the aggressive atrocities of American imperialism!"

At the end of the meeting, the participants unanimously adopted five telegrams to Chairman Mao, Director He Xiangning of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, a letter to all compatriots in the country, a letter to the United Nations, and a letter to Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression.

Overseas Chinese in Malaya Continue to Suffer from British Imperialist Persecution
The Third Group of Expelled Compatriots Arrives in Shantou
Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 7th—Seven hundred and twenty-seven of our compatriots who were expelled by the British colonial authorities in Malaya arrived in Shantou, Guangdong on the 2nd. This is the third group of returning compatriots collectively exiled by British imperialism since November last year.

Representatives from the Shantou Municipal People's Government and local overseas Chinese affairs agencies went to express their sincere condolences and care. The compatriots who have suffered from British imperialist persecution expressed their infinite gratitude for the care of the motherland's government and compatriots.

The repatriated compatriots unanimously expressed their deep hatred for the various fascist atrocities committed by British imperialism against overseas Chinese in Malaya. They pointed out: British imperialism's recent measures to persecute our overseas Chinese compatriots are even more cruel. Returnee Zhang Jiaping pointed out: Since the middle of last month, the British colonial authorities have implemented the so-called "dead zone" policy in places such as Butian, Ge Ban, Pudi, and Duanlu in Perak: stipulating that except for 7:00 to 9:00 in the morning and 4:00 to 6:00 in the afternoon, business transactions are not allowed in shopping malls, and residents are not allowed to go out at all other times. British imperialism even forbids residents in the area from closing their doors, allowing military police to rape women and plunder property in the homes of overseas Chinese. British imperialism also offered a reward of 50 Malayan dollars to anyone who killed a "terrorist." This method of rewarding murder allows British military police to arbitrarily shoot and kill overseas Chinese appearing on the road or at their doorsteps. Many overseas Chinese have been slaughtered or injured in this way. In fact, overseas Chinese living in these "dead zone" areas will either be killed, trapped to death, or starved to death because they cannot engage in any occupation or labor. The returnees unanimously called for an end to this bloody atrocity by British imperialism and for the rescue of overseas Chinese in Malaya.

    抵汕归侨控诉英帝暴行
    表示要参加志愿军抗美援朝
    【本报讯】去年十月九日，二十四日先后抵达汕头的为英帝无理驱逐出境的二批马来亚难侨，共一千三百人，于十二月十九日在潮阳某地举行控诉英帝迫害大会。
    难侨们安抵国门后，立即受到人民政府和各界人民团体的热情慰问和照顾。他们深深感谢毛主席、华侨事务委员会何香凝主任委员和人民政府以及同胞们的慰问。在控诉大会上他们纷纷起来控诉英殖民者的野兽暴行，一致坚决表示：要化愤怒为力量，向英帝国主义者算清血债！
    大会主席郑子炯等同志在致词中指出：马来亚是以华侨的血汗和白骨繁荣起来的。然而英帝对待华侨的却是一次又一次的迫害。一九四八年六月十八日英国殖民当局宣布了法西斯“紧急法令”之后，华侨的生命财产每日每时都受着虐杀和摧毁。整个整个的乡村被英帝轰炸、焚烧。大批华侨被捕、被杀！成千成万的男女老幼被赶出他们手创的家园。这血海深仇，难胞们、马来亚二百余万华侨以及全中国人民是永远不会忘记的！
    男女难侨们相继沉痛地控诉。被英军击中六枪、子弹至今还未取出的曾桂莲，第一个站起来控诉说：一九四九年四月，英帝“肃清”雪兰峨州加影双溪的乡村。二百间房屋被烧光，三百多人流落街头，二十人被驱入集中营。陈金芳等三个华侨妇女遭到大批兽兵轮奸。陈金芳被辱后跳河自尽。一九四九年十一月，兽兵又将加影牙吃村四百多间屋子和一个咖啡园烧光，使得无数的村民无家可归。
    裁缝郑桂玉哭得眼睛红肿，嘶哑地控诉她被十二个兽兵蹂躏的经过。她咬着牙喊道：“我要向全世界控诉！我要报仇！”
    黄木坤、蔡家万等二十余人流泪挥拳控诉，愤怒和复仇的火在他们的胸中燃烧！他们齐声说：“向帝国主义讨还血债！参加志愿军抗美援朝，粉碎帝国主义侵略势力！”
    在控诉大会上，黄志明、黄阿岸、余民胜等三十二人当场报名参军。黄志明说：“为了湔雪新仇旧恨，为了巩固祖国国防，只有更加团结，坚决反对美帝侵略暴行！”
    大会最后一致通过给毛主席、华侨事务委员会何香凝主任委员的信，和告全国同胞书、致联合国书以及致中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会郭沫若主席书等五个通电。
    马来亚华侨续遭英帝迫害
    第三批被逐侨胞抵汕头
    【新华社广州七日电】被马来亚英国殖民当局驱逐出境的我国侨胞七百二十七人，于二日到达广东汕头。这是去年十一月以来被英帝国主义集体放逐的第三批归国侨胞。
    汕头市人民政府和当地的侨务机关都派代表前往亲切地慰问和照料。身受英帝国主义迫害的侨胞们，对于祖国政府与同胞的关怀，表示无限的感谢。
    被逐回国的侨胞们对英帝国主义迫害马来亚华侨的种种法西斯暴行，一致表示切齿痛恨。他们指出：英帝国主义最近迫害我国侨胞的措施，更加残酷。归侨张家平指出：英国殖民当局自上月中旬开始，在霹雳州布先、格板、埔地和端洛等地，又实施所谓“死地”政策：规定每天除上午七时到九时、下午四时到六时外，其他全部时间内，不准商场做买卖，不准居民出门。英帝国主义甚至不准该地区的居民关闭门户，放纵军警到华侨家中奸淫妇女、抢掠财物。英帝国主义又悬赏马来亚币五十元，给杀死每一个“恐怖分子”的人。这个奖励杀人的办法，使英国军警恣意开枪射击在路上或家门出现的华侨。许多华侨这样地被屠杀或击伤。事实上，住在这些“死地”区域中的华侨如果未被杀死，也将被困死或饿死，因为他们没法从事任何职业与劳动。归侨们一致呼吁制止英帝国主义此种血腥暴行，援救在马来亚的侨胞。
