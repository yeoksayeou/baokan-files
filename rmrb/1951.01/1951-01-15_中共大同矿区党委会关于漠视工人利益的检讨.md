Response to People's Daily Criticism

To the Editors:

On December 25th of last year, the People's Daily published worker Zhang Dahe's criticism of the Datong Mining Area's Wajinwan Coal Mine, pointing out that large scales were used when collecting coal, and small scales when selling coal, as well as other phenomena that disregarded the interests of workers. We now offer the following self-criticism based on this criticism:

　　I. The Party Committee's idea of relying on workers was not clear. Since the liberation of Datong, in the Wajinwan mine, although we led all workers in a struggle against the foremen, liberating the workers from the oppression of feudal foremen, we lacked sufficient understanding of the irrational feudal system of the past. We mistakenly believed: "Now that the foremen have been overthrown, the workers can become masters." We did not realize that after the foremen were overthrown, other remaining old systems, old habits, and so-called "old rules" still seriously harmed the interests of the workers, and that we must lead the workers to thoroughly reform these old systems, and conduct a persistent and regular struggle against the remaining feudal ideas. Although we shouted about "relying on the working class" all day long, we did not even solve these necessary and easily solved problems in a timely manner.

　　II. There was serious bureaucracy in the Party Committee's leadership, and ideologically, we valued the work of the large kilns and looked down on the work of the small kilns. Our understanding of the lives of small kiln workers was insufficient. Leading cadres often did not go down to the small kilns, and even if they went, it was just a cursory glance. Therefore, these unreasonable systems were not discovered for a long time.

　　III. We initially did not pay enough attention to the criticism from Comrade Zhang Dahe. This was manifested in: After receiving the criticism, we did not take effective measures to correct the errors, but only dealt with the matter administratively. It was not until the People's Daily sent a second letter of criticism that we sent people down to investigate and resolve it. We are now planning to use this material to educate Party members and cadres in the mining area, in order to overcome the bureaucratic work style of indifference to the interests of workers.

### 中共大同矿区党委会关于漠视工人利益的检讨

专栏：对人民日报批评的反应

　　中共大同矿区党委会关于漠视工人利益的检讨编辑同志：
    去年十二月二十五日，人民日报刊登了工人张大合对大同矿区挖金湾煤矿收煤时用大秤、售煤时用小秤，以及其他漠视工人利益现象的批评。现在我们根据这一批评检讨如下：
    一、党委会依靠工人的思想不明确。自从大同解放后，在挖金湾矿，我们虽曾领导全体工友进行了反把头的斗争，使工人从封建把头的压迫下得到解放；但是我们对过去不合理的封建制度还缺乏足够的认识，错误地认为：“把头既然打倒，工人即可成为主人。”没有认识到把头被打倒后，其他遗留下来的旧制度、旧习惯，所谓“老规矩”还严重损害着工人利益，必须领导工人彻底改革这些旧制度，并对封建残余的思想进行持久和经常的斗争，我们虽然成天地叫嚷“依靠工人阶级”，可是连这些应该的、同时又是容易解决的问题，也没有及时加以解决。
    二、党委会领导上存在着严重的官僚主义，思想上重视大窑的工作，轻视小窑的工作。我们对小窑工人的生活了解是不够的。领导干部经常不下小窑，就是去了也是走马观花，因此，使这些不合理的制度，长期没有发现。
    三、对张大合工友的批评，我们最初并没有引起足够的重视。表现在：接到批评后，并未采取有效的办法纠正错误，只是由行政上处理这件事。一直到人民日报第二次来信批评时，我们才派人下去检查并加以解决。我们现正拟将这一材料教育矿区党员干部，以克服对工人利益漠不关心的官僚主义作风。
