    Since last August, the lives of the Soviet people have been continuously enriched with new events. These events attract the hearts of people throughout the country and encourage them to move forward with greater enthusiasm. These are a series of decisions to build the Kuibyshev and Stalingrad hydroelectric power stations on the Volga River, the Great Turkmen Canal in Turkmenistan, the Kakhovka hydroelectric power station and the South Ukraine Canal and North Crimean Canal on the Dnieper River, and the canal between the Volga and Don Rivers. Since August, workers in many factories in Moscow, Leningrad, the Urals, and all over the Soviet Union have pledged to quickly and perfectly supply excavators, turbines, hydro-generators, sluice gates, high-voltage power lines, timber, cement, reinforcing steel, lime, and other orders for these construction projects. Collective farmers in the Volga River, Don River, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, and Crimea regions have pledged to contribute their personal labor. Electricians, hydraulic engineers, soil scientists, irrigation specialists, chemists, geographers, botanists, engineers, and specialized technicians are actively studying various aspects of the new construction projects. The Soviet Academy of Sciences is preparing to conduct extensive exploration work and will send out Volga-Caspian Sea and Aral Sea-Caspian Sea expeditions including dozens of working teams this spring.
    The implementation of such huge construction projects fully demonstrates the Soviet Union's solid material foundation, the Soviet government's and people's far-sighted vision, and strong will. After the successful completion of the first post-war Five-Year Plan, the Soviet people are making great strides forward. However, to achieve further victories, more factories, mines, oil fields, cultivated land, and pastures are needed, as well as improving the technical equipment of these economic sectors, which requires more electricity and water conservancy. The construction of hydroelectric power stations, canals, and aqueducts will solve the needs of electricity, irrigation, afforestation, and river transport, and will greatly strengthen the Soviet Union's national power.
  II
    The Soviet Union is a country that has already been electrified, a country that has put its entire national economy on the basis of large-scale electrified production. In March 1920, Lenin put forward the state electrification plan: to build thirty large power stations (ten of which were hydroelectric power stations) within ten to twenty years, with a total power of 1.7 million kilowatts. At that time, this was already a huge plan, because it was almost ten times the power of Tsarist Russia. After the construction of the first Volkhov hydroelectric power station, the largest Dnieper hydroelectric power station in Europe, as well as the Kuznetsk, Chelyabinsk, and Zuyevka hydroelectric power stations were built. By 1935, the state electrification plan had been exceeded by almost three times. In 1940, the electricity generated by Soviet power stations exceeded twenty-five times the electricity of Tsarist Russia in 1913.
    Now the Soviet Union will build the world's largest hydroelectric power stations—the Kuibyshev and Stalingrad hydroelectric power stations—from 1951 to 1955 and 1956. The electricity they generate will far exceed the largest hydroelectric power stations in the United States—the Grand Coulee and Boulder hydroelectric power stations. The Kuibyshev hydroelectric power station generates 2 million kilowatts of electricity, and the Stalingrad hydroelectric power station generates no less than 1.7 million kilowatts. In years with normal water levels, the two stations can generate 20 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually. The Kuibyshev hydroelectric power station will supply 6.1 billion kilowatt-hours to Moscow each year, 2.4 billion kilowatt-hours to the Kuibyshev and Saratov regions, and 1.5 billion kilowatt-hours to irrigation projects on the left bank of the Volga River. The Stalingrad hydroelectric power station will supply 4 billion kilowatt-hours to Moscow each year, 2.8 billion kilowatt-hours to the three states of Stalingrad, Saratov, and Astrakhan, and 1.2 billion kilowatt-hours to the states in the central black earth zone. At that time, Moscow will increase its electricity by 10 billion kilowatt-hours each year, and all factories, manufacturing plants, and suburban railways in Moscow can be completely electrified. The establishment of the two major hydroelectric power stations will enable agriculture in the middle and lower reaches of the Volga River to widely use electricity. Basic farming processes, as well as grain milling and milking, will be electrified.
    The construction of hydroelectric power stations is very large. Just loading the soil excavated by the construction workers of the Kuibyshev hydroelectric power station into train cars, the length of these cars can circle the earth four times.
    The power generated by the new hydroelectric power stations on the Volga River, Don River, Dnieper River, and Amu Darya River totals more than 4.4 million kilowatts, and the annual power generation at normal water levels is more than 22 billion kilowatt-hours, which is more than half of the total power generation in the Soviet Union in 1938 (39.6 billion kilowatt-hours). The construction of new hydroelectric power stations will enable the Soviet people to fully use cheap electricity, and will make the Soviet national economy rank first in the world in terms of the speed and degree of electrification.
  III
    The locations of the new canals and irrigation projects that the Soviet Union has decided to build are in the steppe areas of southeastern European Russia and the desert areas of Central Asia. This is a serious struggle against nature. This struggle has already begun, but it will end with the Soviet people conquering nature in the next seven years.
    The steppe areas of southeastern European Russia are originally fertile, but they are often attacked by dry desert winds. There have been fourteen drought years in the first half of the 20th century, with droughts occurring on average every three to five years. In drought years, only 20-30% of the crops on millions of hectares of land are harvested. Turkmenistan, about 90% of which is the Kara-Kum Desert, suffers even more from drought. Wells have to be dug to a depth of 150 to 200 meters to find water. Before the October Revolution, drought was an irresistible natural disaster. After the October Revolution, the Soviet regime actively fought against nature. In 1918, under very difficult circumstances, the People's Committee allocated 50 million rubles to Turkestan for irrigation work. In 1924, Comrade Stalin proposed a plan to transform the arid semi-desert steppes and deserts using irrigation methods. For thirty-three years, the Soviet Union has built irrigation projects in Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Azerbaijan, Armenia, the Volga River Basin, the Terek River, and southern Siberia. The largest is the Fergana Canal in Uzbekistan, built in 1939, which is 350 kilometers long. In the steppe areas, methods such as crop rotation, deep plowing, snow accumulation, grass cutting, and fertilization are used to resist the threat of drought. The severe drought in 1946 did not turn into a disaster due to the assistance of the Soviet government. In 1948, the Soviet government and the Soviet Communist Party passed a fifteen-year plan to plant protective forest belts in order to transform the natural conditions of the steppe and forest-steppe areas of the European part of the Soviet Union. This great plan to transform nature is being implemented at an accelerated pace.
    Now the Soviet Union will complete a series of canal and irrigation projects by 1957.
    The water accumulated by the Kuibyshev hydroelectric power station will irrigate one million hectares of land in parts of the Kuibyshev, Saratov, Penza, and Chekalov states. East of Stalingrad, a 600-kilometer-long canal will be built across the left bank of the Volga River. It will connect the Volga River and the Ural River. It will turn the dry lowlands on the left bank of the Volga River into fertile land. East of Stalingrad, in the desert and semi-desert areas on the north coast of the Caspian Sea, 1.5 million hectares of land will be irrigated, and 12 million hectares of land will be watered. Cotton, rice, wheat, and vegetables will be planted on the irrigated land. The abundance of forage grass on the grasslands will also make animal husbandry flourish. The Stalingrad hydroelectric power station, the irrigation system, and the 13.5 million hectares of forests that will be planted there will fundamentally change the natural landscape of the north coast of the Caspian Sea.
    The 101-kilometer canal between the Volga and Don Rivers, which will be completed this year, and the irrigation canal that draws water from the Don River (to be completed within six years) will increase the irrigated land by 750,000 hectares and the watered land by 2 million hectares in the southern Rostov and Stalingrad states.
    The Kakhovka hydroelectric power station's reservoir on the Dnieper River, the 550-kilometer-long South Ukraine and North Crimean Canals, and the 300-kilometer-long large irrigation canal that pumps water with pumps will irrigate 1.5 million hectares of fertile black soil in the Zaporozhye and Tavriia steppes, and will supply water to 1.7 million hectares of land suitable for animal husbandry there. Cotton and wheat will be planted here, and cattle, sheep, and poultry will be bred.
    The opening of the 1,100-kilometer-long Turkmen Great Canal will be of particular importance in the struggle to conquer drought. If the land in Turkmenistan has sufficient water, it is suitable for cotton planting and animal husbandry. However, the development of industries such as petroleum and coal has been hindered due to water shortage. The water for Krasnovodsk has to be transported from Baku across the Caspian Sea. However, Turkmenistan has the Amu Darya River, which is also a large river in Central Asia, originating from the Pamir and Hindu Kush Plateaus, with 2,000 cubic meters of water per second, flowing north into the Aral Sea in Uzbekistan. The Amu Darya River consumes 50 billion cubic meters of water each year, and its lower reaches are often flooded due to sediment accumulation. Dams have to be built every year to prevent flooding. Currently, these dams are 800 kilometers long. In addition to flowing into the Aral Sea, the Amu Darya River originally had a branch that flowed into the Caspian Sea through the Kunya Darya riverbed, Sarygamysh Lake, and Uzboy ancient riverbed in northern Turkmenistan. In the excavation of the Great Canal, this dried-up river course will be restored, with 500 kilometers of the Uzboy ancient riverbed available for use. Because of the excavation of the canal, the amount of water flowing into the Aral Sea will be reduced, thus eliminating the risk of flooding. The entire Turkmen Great Canal will be navigable. The canal and the 1,200-kilometer-long irrigation canal will irrigate the newly reclaimed cotton fields, 500,000 hectares of land in southwestern Turkmenistan, 300,000 hectares of land in the Amu Darya River Delta, and 500,000 hectares of land in the Kara-Kalpak Autonomous Republic and northern Turkmenistan, and will supply water to 7 million hectares of pastures in the Kara-Kum Desert, while also solving the water needs of cities and enterprises. 500,000 hectares of protective forest belts will be planted around canals, aqueducts, industrial enterprises, and residential areas to prevent sandstorms. Giving water to the desert is like bringing spring back to the earth. Water will bring cotton, rice, silk, fruits, farmland, pastures, hydroelectric power stations, new factories, and new cities. In this way, the desert will be transformed into an oasis.
    These canals and irrigation projects will increase the new land irrigated and benefited by water flow to 28.25 million hectares (i.e., 282,500 square kilometers, approximately equal to the area of two Henan provinces), of which 7.25 million hectares are irrigated land. The wheat produced on the newly irrigated land is enough to feed 70 million people (approximately equivalent to one-third of the Soviet population).
    The Soviet Union attaches great importance to the impact of irrigation on improving agriculture. During the Stalin Five-Year Plan years, the irrigated land in Central Asia, Transcaucasia, and southern Kazakhstan increased by 1.7 million hectares. The Soviet Union currently has a total of approximately 6-7 million hectares of irrigated land. After the new irrigation projects are completed in six to seven years, the irrigated land will double again.
    In addition to building new irrigation projects, the Soviet government also passed a decision to change the existing irrigation system in August of last year. According to this decision, the irrigation system of 4.3 million hectares of land will be changed within three to four years. The existing irrigation system is like this: fixed irrigation canals are too dense, with a canal every 80 meters to 150 meters, dividing the land into small pieces of 1.5 hectares to 10 hectares. These irrigation canals occupy 4% to 6%, or even 10% to 12% of the land, reducing the use of land; it is inconvenient for agricultural machinery to turn around, and the crops will be damaged when turning around, reducing the harvest by 3%-5%; tractors have to bypass the canals when moving from one piece of land to another, wasting fuel; and it increases the burden of clearing the canals. The irrigation canals are small and cannot mechanize the canal clearing work; some water seeps through the canals and is lost, while the soil quality of the cultivated land deteriorates due to excessive moisture in the lower layer; and weeds and pests grow along the canals. According to the experience of advanced farms in the Soviet Union, this irrigation system is no longer suitable for the current level of development of modern Soviet agriculture. The new irrigation system stipulates that a living irrigation system should replace the fixed irrigation system. This irrigation system is only dug open during the irrigation season and filled in during the plowing, sowing, and harvesting seasons. The benefits of the living irrigation system are: eliminating redundant small canals, widening permanent main canals and branch canals, increasing irrigated land, expanding the area of each irrigated land, facilitating the full use of agricultural machinery, improving labor productivity; reducing waterlogging, using more water for irrigation, and at the same time improving soil quality; reducing the burden of clearing canals, and mechanizing canal clearing labor; and reducing the growth of weeds and pests. Under the new irrigation system, each piece of land for planting grain will reach 40 to 60 hectares (equivalent to 600 to 900 Chinese acres) or more, and each piece of land for planting cotton will reach 20 to 40 hectares (equivalent to 300 to 600 Chinese acres) or more. The new irrigation system is of great significance for improving the agricultural technology and harvest of existing irrigated land and the irrigation land that will be increased.
    As a result of building canals and new irrigation projects, and adopting new irrigation systems, the Soviet Union will rank first in the world in the production of agriculture, animal husbandry, technical crops, and fruits.
    This is how the Soviet people are committed to strengthening the peaceful construction of the fortress of world peace.
    This is how the Soviet people are preparing to enter the economic foundation of communism.

　　伟大的共产主义建设工程
    李何  独伊
  一
    自从去年八月间以来，苏联人民的生活中，接连添加了新的事情。这些事情吸引着全国人民的心，鼓舞他们更起劲地前进。这就是在伏尔加河建造古比雪夫和斯大林格勒水电站，在土库曼建造大运河，在第聂伯河建造卡霍夫卡水电站和南乌克兰运河与北克里米亚运河，在伏尔加河和顿河之间建造运河的一连串决定。从八月以后，莫斯科、列宁格勒、乌拉尔以及全苏各地许多工厂的工人都提出保证，要迅速而完善地供应用于这些建筑工程的挖土机、涡轮、水力发电机、水闸门、高压电线、木材、水泥、铁筋、石灰等等订货。伏尔加河、顿河、土库曼、乌克兰和克里米亚的集体农民们，保证贡献出个人的劳动。电力学家、水力学家、土壤学家、灌溉学家、化学家、地理学家、植物学家、工程师和专门技术人员，都在积极研究新建筑工程中各方面的问题。苏联科学院正准备进行广泛的探测工作，今春将派出包括几十个工作队的伏尔加河——里海探测团和碱海——里海探测团。
    这样巨大的建设工程的进行，充分表现出苏联的雄厚的物质基础，苏联政府与人民的远大的眼光和坚强的意志。战后第一届五年计划胜利完成后，苏联人民正大踏步前进。但是要取得进一步的胜利，就需要更多的工厂、矿井、油田、耕地、牧场，就需要提高这些经济部门的技术装备，而这就需要更多的电力和水利。水电站、运河、水渠的建造，将解决电力、灌溉、造林、河运各方面的需要，将大大加强苏联的国力。
  二
    苏联是已经电气化了的国家，是已经把整个国民经济放在电气化的大生产基础之上的国家。一九二○年三月，列宁提出了国家电气化的计划：要在十年到二十年内建立三十个大电力站（其中十个为水电站），总电力为一百七十万千瓦。当时这已经是庞大的计划，因为它几乎十倍于沙皇俄国时代的电力。随着第一个瓦尔和夫斯卡雅水电站建造之后，又建造了欧洲最大的第聂伯水电站以及库兹涅茨斯卡雅、车里雅宾斯卡雅、祖叶夫斯卡雅等水电站。到一九三五年间，国家电气化计划已被超过了差不多三倍。一九四○年，苏联电力站发出的电力，已超过一九一三年沙皇俄国时代电力的二十五倍。
    现在苏联又要在一九五一年到一九五五和五六年建造世界上最大的水电站——古比雪夫和斯大林格勒水电站。它们发出的电力将远超过美国的最大水电站——大河床水电站和鲍尔德水电站。古比雪夫水电站发电力达二百万千瓦，斯大林格勒水电站发电力不下一百七十万千瓦。在水位正常的年份，两站每年可发出二百亿千瓦时的电量。古比雪夫水电站每年将供给莫斯科六十一亿千瓦时，供给古比雪夫区和萨拉多夫区二十四亿千瓦时，供给伏尔加河左岸灌溉工程十五亿千瓦时。斯大林格勒水电站每年将供给莫斯科四十亿千瓦时，供给斯大林格勒、萨拉多夫和阿斯特拉罕三州二十八亿千瓦时，供给中央黑土地带各州十二亿千瓦时。届时莫斯科每年将增加一百亿千瓦时电量，莫斯科的所有工厂，制造厂和近郊的铁道，可以全部电气化。两大水电站的建立，将使伏尔加河中下游的农业广泛地使用电力。基本的农作过程以及碾磨谷物和挤牛乳等都将电气化。
    水电站的建筑工程非常浩大，仅仅把古比雪夫水电站建筑工人所挖的土装到火车厢里，这些车厢的长度可以环绕地球四周。
    伏尔加河、顿河、第聂伯河和阿姆·达里亚河上新水电站的发电力，共达四百四十多万千瓦，在水位正常时每年发电量在二百二十亿千瓦时以上，比一九三八年全苏联发电量（三百九十六亿千瓦时）的一半还多。新水电站的建造，将使苏联人民能够充分使用便宜的电力，将使苏联国民经济在电气化的速度和程度上占世界第一位。
  三
    苏联决定建造的新的运河和灌溉工程的地点，是苏联欧洲东南部的草原地带和中亚细亚沙漠地带。这是一场对自然的严重斗争。这斗争早已开始，但是在最近七年内将以苏联人民征服了自然而告结束。
    苏联欧洲东南部的草原地带本来是肥沃的，但是常常受沙漠干风的侵袭。二十世纪上半期有过十四个旱年，平均三、五年就遭到一次旱灾。在旱年中，几百万公顷的土地只有二三成收成。土库曼约百分之九十是卡拉·库姆沙漠，更是苦旱，井要挖到一百五十公尺到二百公尺深才有水。十月革命以前，旱是不可抗拒的天灾，十月革命之后，苏维埃政权就积极跟自然作斗争。一九一八年，在非常困难的情况下，人民委员会还拨款五千万卢布供给土耳其斯坦进行灌溉工作。一九二四年，斯大林同志就提出了用灌溉方法来改造干旱的半沙漠的草原和沙漠的计划。三十三年来，苏联在乌兹贝克、哈萨克、塔吉克、阿塞拜疆、亚尔门、伏尔加河流域、捷列克、南西伯利亚都建造了灌溉工程。最大的是一九三九年建造的乌兹贝克的菲尔干运河，长三百五十公里。在草原地区，采取了轮种、深耕、聚雪、刈草、施肥等办法来抵抗干旱的威胁。一九四六年苦旱，但由于苏联政府的援助没有成灾。一九四八年苏联政府和苏联共产党为了改造苏联欧洲部分草原和森林草原地带的自然条件，通过了种植防护林带的十五年计划。这个改造自然的伟大计划，正在加速实施中。
    现在苏联又将在一九五七年以前完成一系列的运河和灌溉工程。
    古比雪夫水电站蓄积的水，将灌溉古比雪夫州、萨拉多夫州、宾查州和切卡洛夫州各一部分的一百万公顷土地。斯大林格勒以东，穿越伏尔加河左岸，将建造一条长达六百公里的水渠。它将联接着伏尔加河和乌拉尔河。它将使伏尔加河左岸干燥的低地变成沃野。在斯大林格勒以东，在里海北岸的沙漠和半沙漠地带，受灌溉的土地将达一百五十万公顷，受水的土地将达一千二百万公顷。被灌溉的土地将种植棉花、大米、小麦和蔬菜。草原上饲草的茂盛将使牲畜饲养业也繁荣起来。斯大林格勒水电站、灌溉系统以及将在那里种植的一千三百五十万公顷树林，将根本改变里海北岸的自然面貌。
    伏尔加河和顿河之间的一○一公里运河，将于今年完工，从这运河和从顿河取水的灌溉渠（六年内完工），将使罗斯多夫州和斯大林格勒州南部增加受灌溉的土地七十五万公顷，受水土地二百万公顷。
    第聂伯河上的卡霍夫卡水电站的蓄水池，全长五百五十公里的南乌克兰和北克里米亚运河，以及全长三百公里用抽水机唧水的大灌溉渠，将灌溉萨坡罗什和塔夫里赤斯基草原一百五十万公顷肥沃的黑土，将引水供给那里宜于牲畜饲养的一百七十万公顷土地。这儿将种植棉花和小麦，将繁殖牛、羊和家禽。
    全长一千一百公里的土库曼大运河的开凿，在征服干旱的斗争中，将有特别重要意义。土库曼的土地如果有充足的水，是宜于植棉和牧畜的。然而由于缺水，甚至于石油、煤等工矿业的发展也受到阻碍。克拉斯诺伏斯克的用水，要从里海对岸的巴库运来。可是土库曼却有一条阿姆·达里亚河，也是中亚细亚的大河，发源于帕米尔和兴都库什高原，每秒有二千立方公尺的水，向北流入乌兹贝克境内的碱海。阿姆·达里亚河每年有五百亿立方公尺的水消耗掉，它的下流由于流沙淤积，常常泛滥成灾。每年要筑坝防泛。现在这种坝长八百公里。阿姆·达里亚河原来除了流入之外，还有一支经过土库曼北部的库尼亚·达里亚河床、萨里·卡米什湖和乌兹波依旧河床流入里海。在开凿大运河中，将恢复这一条已经干涸的河道，其中可利用的乌兹波依旧河床达五百公里。因为开凿运河，流入碱海的水量将减少，而免除了水患。土库曼大运河全部将可以通航。运河和全长一千二百公里的灌溉渠，将灌溉新开垦的棉田，西南土库曼五十万公顷土地、阿姆·达里亚河三角洲三十万公顷土地，卡拉·卡尔巴克自治共和国和北土库曼五十万公顷土地，将引水供给卡拉·库姆沙漠地带的牧场七百万公顷土地，同时将解决城市和企业的用水问题。在运河、水渠和工业企业和居民区周围将种植五十万公顷防护林带，以防止流沙。使沙漠得水就是使大地回春。水将带来棉、米、丝、水果、农田、牧场、水电站、新工厂和新城市。这样，沙漠将变成绿洲。
    这些运河和灌溉工程将增加新的受灌溉和受水流之利的土地达二千八百二十五万公顷。（即二十八万二千五百平方公里，约等于两个河南省的面积。）其中受灌溉的土地达七百二十五万公顷。新灌溉的土地上所产的小麦，足够养活七千万人（约相当于苏联人口的三分之一）。
    苏联非常重视灌溉对于改良农业的影响，在斯大林五年计划年份里，中亚细亚、外高加索和南哈萨克受灌溉的土地增加了一百七十万公顷。苏联现有已受灌溉的土地共约六——七百万公顷，六七年后，新灌溉工程完成后，受灌溉的土地又将增加一倍。
    除了建造新灌溉工程之外，苏联政府在去年八月间还通过了改变现有的灌溉系统的决定。按照这个决定，在三四年内，将有四百三十万公顷的土地改变它的灌溉系统。现有的灌溉系统是这样的：固定的灌溉渠太密，每隔八十公尺到一百五十公尺就有一条渠，把土地分割成一点五公顷到十公顷的小块。这种灌溉渠占去土地百分之四至六，甚至百分之十至十二，减少了土地的使用；不便农业机器的转湾，转湾时要压坏庄稼，减少收获量百分之三——五；拖拉机从一块地走到另一块地时要绕渠而过，浪费燃料；并且增加了疏通水渠的负担，灌溉渠小，不能使疏渠工作机械化；有些水浸透水渠损失了，同时耕地的土质却因下层水分过多而转劣；滋长了沿渠的杂草和害虫。据苏联先进农场的经验，这种灌溉系统已不适合于目前苏联现代化农业发展的水平。新的灌溉系统规定以活的灌溉系统来代替固定的灌溉系统，这种灌溉系统仅在灌水时节挖开，而在耕、播、收割时节都填平。活的灌溉系统的好处在于：取消多余的小水渠，加宽永久的总水渠和支水渠，增加灌溉的土地，使受灌溉的每块土地的面积扩大，便于充分地使用农业机器，提高劳动生产率；减少浸水，把水更多地用到灌溉上去，同时改良了土质；减少疏渠的负担，使疏渠劳动机械化；减少杂草害虫的滋长。在新的灌溉系统下，种植谷物的土地每块将达四十至六十公顷（合六百至九百市亩）以上，植棉的土地每块将达二十至四十公顷（合三百至六百市亩）以上。对于提高现有受灌溉的土地和将要增加的灌溉土地的农业技术和收成，新的灌溉系统是有重大意义的。
    建造运河和新的灌溉工程，以及采用新的灌溉系统的结果，苏联在农业、养畜业、技术作物业、水果业的生产方面，将占世界第一位。
    苏联人民，就是这样致力于加强世界和平堡垒的力量的和平建设。
    苏联人民就是这样准备着走进共产主义的经济基础。
