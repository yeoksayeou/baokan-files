　　The Increasingly Developing People's Sports Movement
　　Hao Keqiang
　　With the development of national construction, the improvement of people's economic life and political consciousness, especially in the great movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to defend our homes and country, the broad masses of young people and the people have further requirements and understanding of sports. This time, the vast number of young students responded to the call of the motherland and enthusiastically signed up to participate in military cadre schools, but many people could not participate because their physical conditions were not good enough. Several students from the Department of Electrical Engineering of Tsinghua University signed up to join the Navy, but were not admitted due to poor health. They said sadly, "Today, when the motherland urgently needs us, we do not have a strong enough body and are left in school. This is such a pity." Now, the number of people participating in cross-country running exercises at Tsinghua University every morning has increased from dozens to more than 500 recently. The number of people participating in extracurricular sports activities at Peking University has reached more than 80% of the total number of students in the school. Strengthening exercise to build a strong body and actively participating in sports will gradually become an important part of the lives of the broad masses of people and will increasingly form a widespread mass movement.

　　In the past year, under the advocacy and leadership of the Party and the People's Government, with the support and assistance of the Youth League and the efforts of sports workers across the country, the people's sports movement has made great achievements. According to incomplete materials, 42 provinces and cities have established sports general branches, branches, or preparatory committees. In 1950, provinces and cities held 120 large-scale sports meets, of which 59 were attended by 290,000 athletes. There were even more regular ball games and various sports performances held during festivals. The composition of the athletes included workers, soldiers, students, farmers, government cadres, and citizens. Workers' sports meets were held in Shanghai and the Northeast, women's sports meets were held in Wuhan, Lushun-Dalian, and Shanghai, and many troops held sports meets for commanders and fighters. Excellent athletes are also gradually emerging. Four national records have been broken in women's discus, standing long jump, 60-meter race, and 80-meter low hurdles. At the Guangzhou First Sports Meet volleyball competition, the tricycle worker team won the championship. At the Chahar Duolun Sports Meet, 25 farmers won awards. Excellent athletes are also models in production, combat, work, and study. For example, a football team representative from Tianjin No. 4 Cotton Mill is also one of the production models selected by Tianjin. Many school athletes enthusiastically signed up to participate in military cadre schools. In this enthusiastic mass sports movement, the vast majority of athletes also demonstrated the new sports ethics of unity, friendship, and collectivism, and basically overcame the bad habits of championship-ism and showing-off-ism of the old society.

　　Sports workers across the country are eager to make progress and demand to study politics and professional skills. In order to guide their learning in a planned way, provinces and cities have held many short-term sports training courses or seminars. The Preparatory Committee of the All-China Sports Federation held a summer study session for sports workers across the country last year. Under the condition of insufficient material resources, sports workers in various places also worked with the masses to overcome difficulties and used their own labor to build sports venues and equipment.

　　In addition, the Chinese Student Sports Team participated in the sports competition of the Second World Student Congress last July. Sports workers from various places formed a Chinese sports delegation to visit the Soviet Union last August to learn from the advanced sports experience of the Soviet Union.

　　There is no doubt that China's people's sports movement will continue to develop on the existing foundation. The leading organs in various places should combine with the actual situation in the people, especially the organized masses, to widely carry out valuable sports activities suitable for the season; publicize the importance of physical exercise for national defense and production construction, so that the masses can turn their patriotic enthusiasm into practical actions and consciously participate in various sports activities. And actively research and create sports teaching materials suitable for the masses in various different work and production departments to meet the needs of the people. The issue of establishing or improving the leading institutions of sports and cultivating sports cadres also needs to be properly resolved.

　　However, because sports have long been controlled by the reactionaries in the past, separated from the people, separated from labor and production, and especially poisoned and influenced by the sports of the American imperialist bourgeoisie, the foundation of China's people's sports movement is still relatively weak. At present, some places have not paid enough attention to and have a correct understanding of the people's sports movement. For example, some schools call physical education classes one of the "minor four subjects," and some people say, "There is no future in engaging in sports work." Some people think that "laboring and sweating is sports," or simply replace sports with military training. These phenomena should be quickly corrected. The impatience that ignores the current national situation and demands too much, and the negative waiting attitude of sports workers also need to be overcome. The comprehensive and vigorous development of the people's sports movement still depends on our active efforts. (Attached pictures)

　　日益开展中的人民体育运动
    郝克强
    随着国家建设事业的发展，人民经济生活和政治觉悟的提高，尤其是在伟大的抗美援朝保家卫国运动中，广大青年和人民群众对于体育运动已有了进一步的要求和认识。这次广大青年学生响应祖国召唤，踊跃报名参加军事干部学校，但是许多人却因为体格条件不够而不能参加。清华大学电机系有几个同学报名参加海军，因身体不好没有被录取，曾沉痛地说：“今天祖国迫切需要我们的时候，我们却没有足够健壮的身体而被留在学校里，这是多么可痛惜的事。”现在，清华大学每天早晨参加越野跑练习的人，由原来的几十个人，最近已增加到五百多。北京大学参加课外体育活动的人数已达全校人数的百分之八十以上。加强锻炼强健的身体，积极参加体育运动，将逐渐地成为广大人民群众生活中的重要部分，并将日益形成为广泛群众性的运动。
    一年来，人民体育运动在党和人民政府的提倡和领导下，在青年团的支持协助和全国体育工作者的努力下，已得到很大的成绩。根据不完全的材料，已有四十二个省市成立了体育总分会、分会或分筹会。一九五○年各省市所举办的规模较大的体育大会有一百二十次，其中五十九次中参加的运动员达二十九万人。其他经常的利用节日举行的球赛，各种运动表演等为数更多。运动员的成份包括工人、战士、学生、农民、机关干部和市民等。上海东北等地举行了工人体育大会，武汉、旅大、上海等地举行了女子体育大会，许多部队举行了指战员们的体育大会。优秀的运动选手也逐渐涌现，女子铁饼，立定跳远，六十公尺赛跑，八十公尺低栏四项已打破了过去的全国纪录。广州市第一届体育大会的排球赛，三轮车工人联队获冠军。察哈尔多伦的体育大会上有二十五个农民得奖。优秀的运动员们在生产战斗，工作学习上也都是模范，如天津中纺四厂的一个足球队代表队员，也是天津市选出的生产模范之一，许多学校的运动员踊跃报名参加军事干部学校。在这一热烈的群众性的体育运动中，绝大多数的运动员们还表现了团结友爱，集体主义的新体育道德作风，基本上克服了旧社会锦标主义，风头主义的恶劣作风。
    全国各地的体育工作者们迫切要求进步，要求学习政治与业务。为了有计划地领导他们的学习，各省市曾举办了许多体育的短训班或讲习会。中华全国体育总会筹备委员会在去年举办了全国体育工作者暑期学习会。在物质条件不足的情况下，各地的体育工作者们并和群众一道，克服困难，用自己的劳动修建体育场地和设备。
    此外，中国学生体育队，去年七月曾出国参加世界学生第二次代表大会的体育比赛。各地的体育工作者，曾组成中国体育访问团，于去年八月赴苏访问，学习苏联的先进体育经验。
    毫无疑问，中国的人民体育运动将在已有的基础上继续向前发展。各地的领导机关应在人民群众首先是有组织的群众中，结合实际情况，广泛地开展适合于季节的有价值的体育运动；宣传体育锻炼对于国防与生产建设的重要，使群众把爱国的热情变成实际行动，自觉地参加各种体育运动。并积极研究创编适合于各种不同工作生产部门的群众的体育教材，以适应人民的需要。关于建立或健全体育运动的领导机构和培养体育干部的问题，也需要适当地解决。
    但是，由于过去体育长期被反动派掌握，与人民脱离，与劳动生产脱离，特别是受到美帝国主义资产阶级体育的毒化与影响，中国人民体育运动的基础还比较薄弱。目前有些地方对于人民体育运动还没有引起足够的重视和正确的认识。如有的学校把体育课称为“小四门”之一，有人说：“搞体育工作没有出息”。有人认为“劳动劳动出点汗就是体育”，或简单地以军事训练代替体育，这些现象应当迅速得到纠正。体育工作者中的忽略目前国家实际情况而要求太高的急躁情绪和消极的等待情绪也有待克服。人民体育运动全面蓬勃的发展，还有赖于我们的积极努力。（附图片）
