Response to Criticism from People's Daily

　　Industrial Department of the East China Military and Political Committee
    Regarding the Improvement of Shandong Electric Factory's Letter to This Newspaper

People's Daily:

    The Ministry previously received a notification from the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry, instructing it to further study and improve the Shandong Electric Factory's work system, etc., which were published in the People's Daily on September 21st of last year, and to report back. The Ministry then sent personnel to Shandong to understand the overall situation and submit a report. After detailed analysis and discussion by the Ministry, it was believed that the factory's fundamental problems were insufficient organizational leadership, unclear division of responsibilities, a lack of technical personnel, and a chaotic work system, which resulted in various shortcomings and errors.

    The Shandong Office of the Ministry has now been notified to study specific improvement measures nearby based on various improvement suggestions, in order to fundamentally improve the situation and bring all production and management work back on track. Having read the news that Comrade Wang Huihua, a worker correspondent, wrote in the People's Daily on December 18th about the factory's work not having improved in the past two months, in addition to sincerely accepting this criticism and notifying them to pay attention to studying improvements, this letter briefly describes the Ministry's handling of this case, and we pray for your consideration.

专栏：对人民日报批评的反应

　　华东军政委员会工业部     
    关于改进山东电器厂给本报的信人民日报社：
    本部前奉中央重工业部通知，以根据人民日报上年九月二十一日刊登山东电器厂工作制度等有偏差，嘱加研究改进具报。当由本部派员去鲁了解，针对全面情况提出报告，经本部详加分析研讨，认为该厂的基本症结所在，是组织领导不够健全，分工责任不明，技术干部缺乏，工作制度混乱，由是而产生各种缺点和错误。
    今已通知本部山东办事处根据各项改进建议，就近研究具体改进步骤，以期从根本上予以改善，使一切生产管理工作步入正轨。顷读人民日报十二月十八日载工人通讯员王辉华同志所写该厂两月来工作并未改进的消息，除诚意接受此项批评并通知他们注意研究改进外，爰将本部处理本案情况备函简述，即祈查照。
                                        华东军政委员会工业部
                                        一九五一年一月十一日
