　　From Ya'an to Xichang
    ——A Visit to the Yi Area of ​​Xikang
    Zhengfu

    On September 3, 1950, I set off from Ya'an, Xikang Province, and after seventeen days of trekking over mountains and rivers, arrived in Xichang on the 19th, traversing most of the southeastern Yi areas of Kang Province. Along the way, I saw hillsides covered with patches of buckwheat with blossoming purplish-red flowers, and herds of cattle, sheep, mules, and horses galloping and foraging.

    On the north bank of the Dadu River, it is said that ethnic minorities used to live. A doctor at a pharmacy in Fulin County (close to the Dadu River) said: During the Ming Dynasty, Yi people lived here, but later, the Manchu Qing and Kuomintang reactionary governments implemented a "control the barbarians" policy, driving all the Yi compatriots south of the Dadu River.

    Passing through Haitang and Yuexi counties, crossing Xiaoxiang Ridge to Dengxiangying, Lugu (under the jurisdiction of Mianning County), Lizhou (under the jurisdiction of Xichang County), and all the way to Xichang, many Yi people could be seen coming and going to the market in every town to buy and sell things. They mostly exchanged potatoes, rice, and firewood for salt and cloth.

    During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, the Yi people did not have freedom of movement: to enter the city, they had to pay an entrance fee to the officials, and to walk on the main road, they had to pay a road fee. Now that they are liberated, they can freely walk around on any street. In Lugu, an Yi man named Shekeleha said: "Our greatest comfort is that now everyone treats us like human beings!" Among the general Yi people, there is endless gratitude for the People's Government's protection of their lives and property.

    On the road from the Dadu River to Xichang, one often sees historical evidence of reactionary rule, such as "Pacify the Barbarians" and "Suppress the Barbarians." North of Yuexi City, there is an iron chain bridge named "Lock the Barbarians Bridge," said to have been built to publicize Yang Renan’s (former commander of the Kuomintang government's Ya'an border area) "virtuous governance" in pacifying the Yi people. In Wangjiatun, twenty miles north of Yuexi, and in Xichang city, there are still traces of slogans written by He Guoguang's bandit troops, such as "Exterminate the Yi Bandits." In the home of Deng Xiuting (puppet commander of the Ning Border Area) in Lugu, there are still torture instruments such as iron cages, water prisons, iron shackles, wooden shackles, handcuffs, fetters, and eighty-pound "lock the barbarians" iron chains. These instruments of torture were still in use before liberation.

    Deng Xiuting was from Qianxiangying, Mianning. Because he often committed evil deeds and assassinated people, he was appreciated by the Kuomintang reactionary government. The Kuomintang reactionary authorities appointed him as the head of the Lushao Defense Camp to manage the main road from Xiaoxiang Ridge to Xichang. Deng then took the opportunity to collect "shao fees" from Yi people passing by and often robbed them. Kuomintang officials all sought Deng Xiuting to "guard the shao" when passing through here, so his fame grew and he was even more valued by the Kuomintang reactionary government, gradually rising to the rank of regimental commander. In 1925, the Kuomintang government established the Jingbian Command, and Deng Xiuting jumped to become the "commander." Thus, he did everything he could to slaughter and persecute the Yi compatriots. By 1931, the "eliminate the black, keep the white" "control the barbarians" policy resulted in the slaughter of tens of thousands of Black Yi people, and some were driven away. The Black Yi people living in eastern Mianning had to pay tribute, deliver grain, and do any unpaid labor for Deng's family. Deng could kill any Yi man from any family at will, and turn other people's wives, children, and land into his own property. Deng's family often had more than a hundred children, male children could be beaten to death at will, and female children could be sold at will. Deng's family organized all the White Yi people into baojia according to the army's organization, and appointed confidants, conferred the title of Shiliemaao to rule them. These Yi people had to listen to his orders at any time and go on expeditions. Under this bloody rule, the White Yi people suffered cruel abuse and exploitation. After liberation, they all asked the People's Government to allow the Black Yi compatriots who had been driven away to return, and the Black Yi people also asked the government to allow them to return and distribute land to them.

    Another method Deng Xiuting used to rule the Yi people was called "using Yi to control Yi," "befriending those far away and attacking those nearby," which meant buying off one group of Yi people to kill the leader of another group, forcing them to surrender. They had to bring a large amount of surrender fees when they surrendered. Or secretly tell the leader of a certain group of Yi people: "A certain group is going to kill you," and tell another group: "A certain group is going to kill you." Thus, there was no right or wrong, but because of instigation and discord, hatred was aroused, and "feuds" broke out. According to Yi customs, killing someone requires compensation in silver. Deng stipulated that killing a Black Yi person cost 12,000 taels of silver, and killing a White Yi person cost 6,000 taels of silver. Because both sides were close to Deng, Deng profited from it and made a fortune in "human life." Deng was also a large company selling people. Sometimes he robbed Han people and sold them to Yi people as children; sometimes he lent money with people as collateral, and sold them when they were overdue. Deng's family often had more than a hundred children, which can be said to be a constant "inventory." In addition, he robbed and captured Yi people everywhere, selling children to Daliangshan like herding cattle and sheep. Men cost 300 taels of silver each, women 400 taels, and children 500 taels or more. In this way, Deng made a fortune in "living people." After liberation, more than 300 cases of lawsuits have been filed by the families of those who were sold.

    On the four gates of Yuexi City, there are still steles prohibiting Yi people from entering the city. In places like Lugu, Yi people who carried a load of firewood to the market to sell in the past did not dare to go to the main street, and had to set up stalls in remote places. What made the Yi people even more resentful was that various institutions, tax checkpoints, schools, townships, offices, police stations, and other diverse institutions all had to collect taxes. As a result, the money from selling things was not enough to drink a bowl of cold jelly. If they couldn't sell it, some would even be confiscated. Today, after liberation, the various forms of exploitation in the past have been abolished; the Han people's discrimination against the Yi people in terms of personality is gradually being eliminated. Every Yi person coming and going on the street is filled with joy.

    According to Bila Shibu, head of the Ethnic Affairs Section of the Yuexi County People's Government: "As soon as the People's Government was established, various groups of Yi people came to make contact, expressing their acceptance of the leadership of the People's Government. The same is true in Mianning and Xichang. From April to early September 1950, the Ethnic Affairs Section and the Judicial Section of Yuexi County handled more than 600 cases between Yi and Han people and within the Yi people, almost 100% of which were economic cases or related to economic issues. The Xichang District Ethnic Affairs Office has also handled and accepted 413 Yi people's lawsuits since its establishment in early April to mid-September. The method of handling these cases is mediation between the two parties and following the general customs and habits of the Yi compatriots. Therefore, both parties expressed satisfaction. Recently, such a thing happened in Yuexi: A girl from the Habibi tribe was originally married to the Luowu tribe as a daughter-in-law; later, this girl married the Ahou family, and the Luowu tribe had no way for three or four years. Recently, a girl from the Habibi tribe married the Ahou family, and because the man died, the Luowu tribe snatched this girl to replace the previous one. After this incident, they asked the People's Government to solve it. The government adopted a mediation approach, first returning the girl snatched by the Luowu tribe to the Ahou family. As for the loss suffered by the Luowu family due to the original Habibi girl's remarriage to the Ahou family, the government asked them to sue and deal with it separately. According to Yi customs, the Ahou family should return the daughter-in-law to the Luowu tribe, but if they really don't want to return her, the Habibi family must return the betrothal gift paid by the Luowu tribe when they were engaged. This approach avoided the "fighting enemies" incident, and both parties nodded in praise.

    On June 17, the Xichang District (also known as the Ning District, including counties south of the Dadu River and north of the Jinsha River, such as Xichang, Huili, Dechang, Yanyuan, Yanbian, Yuexi, Mianning, Zhaojue, Ningnan, and Ningdong) convened a minority nationality symposium, which jointly formulated eight major covenants: (1) Support the Communist Party, the People's Government, and the People's Liberation Army, and implement ethnic policies. (2) Under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, sincerely love and unite with each other, and do not discriminate against or oppress each other. (3) There shall be no mutual fighting of enemies or any acts of deception, extortion, robbery, burning, or killing among the various ethnic groups and within the minority ethnic groups. (4) Oppose those who spread rumors and intimidate the people, eliminate all residual bandits and secret agents of the Kuomintang reactionaries, and protect traffic and public security. (5) In the event of a dispute, people should be invited to mediate immediately. Local headmen have the responsibility to actively help mediate. If mediation fails, they should report to the People's Government for handling. (6) Do not kidnap people into slavery, and do not encroach on other people's land. (7) Promote the establishment of schools and mobilize children to study. (8) Promote labor for everyone and increase production. The above eight articles have been observed by the Yi people in Yuexi, Mianning, and Xichang counties. In the event of a dispute, they are willing to go to the government for mediation, and there have been few robberies in various places.

    Crossing the Dadu River, passing through Yuexi, and all the way to Xichang, many groups of three or five Yi people were found guarding at important intersections. At first, everyone was worried about what might happen, but it was not until they arrived in Yuexi that they realized that this was one of the resolutions of the minority nationality representative meeting to support the People's Liberation Army in protecting traffic. The Yi people also voluntarily helped the government collect the guns discarded by the Kuomintang reactionaries. Guo Ji Mada of the Luoji family in Yuexi voluntarily handed over the hidden Kuomintang secret agent Dong Yide (deputy division commander of He Guoguang's bandit troops).

    At the two Yi people's welcome meetings for the representatives of the Central Visiting Group in Yuexi and Lugu, they asked the visiting group to reflect their common opinions to the Central People's Government: to help them develop education, increase knowledge, and cultivate minority nationality cadres. Every Yi person we contacted complained bitterly that they had no opportunity to receive education during the Kuomintang rule, which led to their backwardness. They said: "In the past, the Kuomintang ran schools, and if you sent a child there, they not only didn't teach the Yi language, but they didn't even allow you to speak the Yi language. The teachers didn't teach well either, and you couldn't learn anything even after a few years." The Kuomintang forced Yi people's children to go to school, and if you didn't go, it wouldn't work. In reality, it became a hostage for extorting money from the Yi people. On the other hand, Han children looked down on Yi children and called them "little barbarians" and "barbarian girls." Even if you went to school and learned some skills, Deng Xiuting was afraid that you would become a big deal and always try to kill you. So everyone didn't dare to send their children to school. Today, they are all actively demanding to go to school and actively asking the government for assistance. An Yi man from the Muhuo Xinzhe tribe named Luo Wu Asu said a very good thing in the Yi language, which, when translated, means this: "The Kuomintang reactionaries have been overthrown, and the Yi people have turned over. Chairman Mao is like the sun. The sun is always shining and always shining on the Yi people. The Yi people are like the stars around the sun, and they also shine forever with the light of the sun."

　　从雅安到西昌
    ——西康彝区访问记
    征夫
    一九五○年九月三日，我由西康省雅安起程，翻山越岭，经十七天的跋涉，于十九日到达西昌，纵穿康省东南部彝族同胞住区的大部。沿途见山坡上满布着一片片盛开紫红花的荞子，成群的牛、羊、骡、马，奔驰寻食。
    在大渡河的北岸，据说过去曾有少数民族住过。富林县（紧靠大渡河）一家药店的医生说：在明代时，这里有彝人住着，后来，满清和国民党反动政府实行“制夷”政策，将彝族同胞都赶到大渡河以南去了。
    经海棠、越巂县，翻小相岭至登相营、泸沽（冕宁县属），礼州（西昌县属），一直到西昌，每个市镇上都有许多彝民在来往赶场，买卖东西。他们多以洋芋、米粮、木柴等换取食盐和布匹。
    彝民在国民党反动统治时期，是没有出入自由的：他们进城，须向官家拿进城费，走大路须拿走路费。现在他们得到解放了，在任何街上可以自由地走来走去。在泸沽，一个名叫舍克咧哈的彝民说：“我们最大的安慰。就是现在大家把我们当人看了！”在一般彝民当中，对人民政府保障他们生命财产的安全，更是感激不尽的。
    自大渡河至西昌的路上，常常见到“平夷”“镇夷”等历史上反动统治的罪证。越巂城北有一座铁索桥，取名“锁夷桥”，据说是为宣扬羊仁安（原国民党政府雅属边区司令）平彝的“德政”而修建的。在越巂北二十里的王家屯和西昌城里至今还有贺国光匪部写的“剿灭夷匪”等标语的痕迹。泸沽邓秀廷（伪宁属边区司令）的家里，至今还保有“制夷”的铁牢、水牢、铁枷、木枷、手铐、脚镣以及八十斤重的“锁夷”的铁链等刑具。这些刑具在解放前，仍然是被使用着的。
    邓秀廷是冕宁乾相营人。由于经常为非作歹，暗杀人民，被国民党反动政府所赏识。国民党反动当局封他为路哨保卫营长，来管理小相岭通往西昌的大道。邓匪即借此向过路彝民收“哨费”，并经常抢劫彝民。国民党官吏凡经过这里都找邓秀廷“保哨”，于是他的名气日张，更为国民党反动政府所器重，逐渐提升为团长。一九二五年国民党政府成立靖边司令部，邓秀廷便一跃而为“司令”。于是，他便在彝族同胞中间，极尽其屠杀迫害的能事。至一九三一年，“去黑留白”的“制夷”方针，使上万的黑彝遭到屠杀，有的被赶走了。在冕宁东部居住的黑彝，要给邓匪家里纳贡、交粮和做任何无代价的劳动。邓匪可以将任何一家的彝男打死，而把别人的老婆、孩子、土地等，都变为自己的财产。邓匪家里过去经常有百余娃子，男娃子可以被任意打杀，女娃子可以被任意出售。邓匪家里将所有的白彝按军队的编制编成保甲，委任亲信，封士列茅来统治他们。这些彝民要随时听其调动出征。白彝人民在这种血腥的统治下，受尽了残酷的虐杀与压榨。解放后他们都向人民政府要求，让被赶走的黑彝同胞回来，黑彝人民也要求政府允许他们回来，并分给土地。
    邓秀廷统治彝人的另一个方法，叫做“以夷制夷”，“远交近攻”，就是收买一支彝民，去打死某一支彝民的首领，强迫他们来投降。投降时，必须带大批的投降费。或者暗对某支彝民的首领说：“某一支要打死你”，又对另一支说：“某一支要打死你”，于是本无是非，却因挑拨离间，引起仇恨，打起“怨家”来了。按彝民风俗，打死人要赔偿银子的，邓匪规定，打死一个黑彝一万二千两银子，打死一个白彝，六千两银子，因双方都靠近邓匪，邓匪从中渔利，于是大发“人命财”。邓匪又是一个卖人的大公司。有时是把汉人抢来，卖给夷人当娃子；有时是放债以人为抵押，逾期就将人卖掉。邓匪家里经常有百余娃子，可说是经常的“存货”。此外，更四处抢劫捕捉彝人，像赶牛羊一样，向大凉山卖娃子。男人每名银子三百两，女人四百两，小孩五百两不等。这样邓匪又大发其“活人财”。解放后，被卖家属，提起诉讼的已达三百多件。
    在越巂城四门上，至今仍有禁止彝民入城的碑子。在泸沽等地方，过去彝民背一担柴到集上去卖，不敢到大街上去，只好在偏僻的地方摆摊。更使彝民痛恨的是各机关、税卡、学校、乡保、办公处、警察派出所等五花八门的机关，都要收税。结果，卖了东西的钱还不够喝一碗凉粉。如果卖不了，甚至有的就被没收了。今天解放了，过去种种剥削已被取消；汉人对彝人人格上的歧视，已在逐渐清除中。每个来往于街上的彝民，都无不喜形于色。
    据越巂县人民政府民族科长毕拉什补说：“人民政府一成立，各支彝民纷纷都来接头，表示接受人民政府的领导。冕宁、西昌各地，也都是这样。一九五○年四月至九月初，越巂县民族科连同司法科处理的彝汉间与彝民内部的案件已达六百余件，其中几乎百分之百的是经济案件或与经济有关的问题。西昌区民族事务处，自四月初成立，至九月中旬，也处理和接受彝民讼诉案件四百一十三件。这些案件处理的方法，是双方调解，并遵照彝族同胞一般的风俗习惯。因此，双方无不表示满意的。在越巂最近发生一件这样的事情：哈比支的一个姑娘，本来嫁给了洛巫支做媳妇；后来这个姑娘又与阿侯家结婚，洛巫支三、四年没有办法。最近哈比支的一个女子嫁给阿侯家，因男方死了，洛巫支将这个女子抢去顶先前的一个。这件事发生后，他们要求人民政府解决。政府采取调解的办法，首先将被洛巫支抢去的女子，退还阿侯家，至于原来哈比支女子转嫁阿侯家使洛巫支家受的损失，政府要他们起诉，另作处理。遵照彝民的风俗习惯，要阿侯家退还洛巫支媳妇，实在不愿退，必须由哈比支家退还洛巫支订婚时所付的聘金。这样处理，免除了“打冤家”的事端，双方都额首称赞。
    西昌区（又称宁属区，包括大渡河以南，金沙江以北，西昌、会理、德昌、盐源、盐边、越巂、冕宁、昭觉、宁南、宁东等县）于六月十七日，召开了少数民族座谈会，曾经共同订出八大公约：（一）拥护共产党，拥护人民政府和解放军，执行民族政策。（二）在共产党和人民政府领导下，切实友爱团结，不互相歧视压迫。（三）各民族之间和少数民族内部，不得有互相打冤家及一切欺骗、敲诈、抢掳、烧杀等行为。（四）反对造谣恫吓人民的挑拨离间分子，肃清国民党反动派一切残余匪特，保护交通治安。（五）凡发生纠纷，应即请人调解，各地头人，有主动帮助调解的责任，调解不了时，应报请人民政府处理。（六）不掳人为奴，不侵占别人土地。（七）提倡兴办学校，动员子弟读书。（八）提倡人人劳动，增加生产。以上八条已为越巂、冕宁、西昌各县彝民所遵守，凡发生纠纷都愿到政府调解，各地已很少发生抢夺事件。
    过大渡河，经越巂一直到西昌，沿途发现不少三、五成群的彝民，在重要路口守望着。开始时，大家还担心着会发生什么事故，但是到了越巂才知道这是少数民族代表会支援解放军保护交通的决议之一。彝民们还自动地帮助政府收集国民党反动派丢弃的枪枝。越巂裸鸡家的果鸡马达曾自动交出隐藏的国民党特务董义德（贺国光匪部副师长）。
    在越巂、泸沽两次彝民欢迎中央访问团的代表会上，他们要求访问团向中央人民政府反映他们共同的意见：帮助他们发展教育，增加知识，培养少数民族干部。我们所接触的任何彝民，无不苦诉他们在国民党统治时，没有受教育的机会，以致使他们落后。他们说：“过去国民党办学校，送去一个孩子，不但不教彝文，连彝话也不许说。先生又不好好的教，几年都还学不到什么。”国民党抽彝民的小孩上学，不去不行，去了实际上，成了搜刮彝民银钱的人质。另一方面是汉人孩子瞧不起彝人孩子，叫他们“小蛮子”，“蛮丫头”。即便上了学，学了点本事，邓匪秀廷又怕他成了大事，总要设法杀掉他。所以大家也不敢使他们的子弟上学。今天他们都积极要求上学了，积极要求政府扶助。一个目火心则支的彝民名叫洛吾阿素的，他用彝语说了一段很出色的话，翻译出来是这样一个意思：“国民党反动派被打倒了，彝民翻身了。毛主席好比太阳。太阳是永远发光的，永远照着彝民。彝民好像太阳周围的星星，借太阳的光也永远发亮。”
