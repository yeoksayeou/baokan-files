Reader's Letters

A Catholic's Plea

To the People's Daily:

I was formerly a Chinese priest in the Catholic Church, and also served as the principal of a private Catholic school for ten years. However, since the latter half of 1950, due to my increased political awareness, I joined the China Democratic League. This progressive action was unacceptable to the Church, and I was removed from my position as principal.

Since reading the Christian Reform Manifesto published in the newspapers in September 1950 and the news of patriotic movements by Christians across the country, my heart has been ablaze. I wish I could transform myself into a loudspeaker to call on all Catholics nationwide to unite and take action. At this moment, I also saw the declaration of Catholics in Guangyuan County, Sichuan, and I became even more excited. The declaration of Guangyuan Catholics is the first shot in the patriotic call of the Chinese Catholic Church, which is the voice that three million Chinese Catholics should have. Today, the church most deeply and extensively influenced by imperialism in China is the Catholic Church. Imperialism uses Catholic missionaries to anesthetize believers with insidious enslaving education, deceiving and enticing them, turning millions of Chinese people into silent and odorless "cultural slaves." Some Chinese people only know the Church but not the country; they only know they are Catholics but not that they are citizens of China; they only know to believe in God but not to love the motherland; they only know to obey foreign missionaries but not to revere the great people's leader Chairman Mao – the true savior of the Chinese people; they only know how to attend Mass but not how to study and progress, let alone understand national policies; they only know how to pray but not how to contribute useful strength to the motherland; even if some are awakened, they dare not take resolute action... They strive to train believers to this extent, which is truly an insidious means of imperialism, and completely the ambition of imperialism to enslave the Chinese people. They have used enslaving education and strict religious rules to train many kind Chinese people and thousands upon thousands of promising young people into wooden figures. However, today the Chinese people have stood up majestically under the leadership of the Communist Party. Who is willing to let imperialism continue to use the Church to carry out their conspiracy of aggression against China? Who can bear to watch their compatriots be oppressed by the enslaving education of imperialism? Today, Chinese Catholics should rise up and sever ties with reactionary foreign missionaries. Imperialism must no longer be allowed to continue to oppress, deceive, and enslave the three million compatriots of our motherland! Only in this way can the reform of the Catholic Church be promoted!

In addition, I have an opinion that I hope your newspaper will convey: Since the declaration of Guangyuan Catholics has a great impact on the three million Catholics nationwide, we hope that all newspapers across the country can publish it together. Xinhua News Agency issued this news on December 13th last year, but we only saw it in an inconspicuous corner of the Gansu Daily on December 17th. Many newspapers across the country had not published it by the 15th or 16th. I hope this will attract the attention of relevant departments.

With sincere respect,
Liu Guangyuan, Deputy Secretary-General, Tianshui Branch, China Democratic League

Two Years, Beijing Has Changed!

Dear Editor:

In the winter of 1948, when the People's Liberation Army besieged Beijing, I was unfortunately wounded in the leg by a gun fired by the Kuomintang bandit army. Because I had no money to stay in the hospital, I had to lie at home to recuperate; it was not until the end of 1950 that I recovered.

I lay in bed for two years, as if isolated from society. During this time, I heard the children in my family singing "The sky in the liberated area is a bright sky..." When the rickshaw pullers in the neighborhood spoke, they immediately mentioned "Liberation!..." Also, a clothing factory worker who lived in the same courtyard as me often looked worried during the Kuomintang rule; since Beijing was liberated, I sometimes saw her from the window, and her former haggard face had turned into a cheerful and rosy smiling face. These situations made me feel very strange. Lying in bed was really anxious, I couldn't wait to get better and take a stroll on the street.

At the end of 1950, my injury was almost healed; I really couldn't wait. I slowly left the alley, holding a cane. When I walked to Dongdan Archway, I was immediately shocked. The road from Dongdan to Chang'an Avenue, which used to be not very wide, has now become two wide and large avenues. While I was surprised, I saw a People's Liberation Army comrade riding a bicycle slip on the snow on the ground and hit a citizen riding a bicycle behind him. I thought this "old general" might vent his anger on the bumped civilian. Contrary to what I thought! The PLA comrade actually apologized to the citizen amicably, saying, "Sir! I'm so sorry. Is the bike broken? If it's broken, I'll fix it for you." I was surprised and moved by these words. The People's Liberation Army is really the team of the people, so kind!

When I was crossing the road with my cane, a traffic "police" came towards me. I couldn't walk fast, and I anxiously thought: I'm going to get scolded. But no, the policeman saw that I was sick, so he carefully helped me cross the road, and kindly told me, "Walk slowly, today is New Year's Eve, there are a lot of cars, don't get hit." I thought at the time: The sky in the liberated area is really a bright sky! Both the "soldiers" and the "police" have changed. In the past, during the Kuomintang rule, that cycling citizen would at least be scolded, and I would definitely be reprimanded by the police. I happily walked step by step towards Wangfujing Street, and saw a portrait of Chairman Mao hanging at the entrance of the Youth Service Department. He had a smiling face, as if smiling at every citizen. I stopped in front of his portrait and felt infinite respect in my heart. Chairman Mao: You have really changed Beijing for the better!

When I was standing in front of the portrait, I saw a group of young students coming out of the Youth Service Department, each with a smiling face, singing "The East is red, the sun rises, China has produced a Mao Zedong." I saw their mood, extremely happy. I slowly walked to the entrance of Wangfujing again, and heard the sound of drums, and a group of young lads came, beating waist drums. How happy those young lads were! I hired a car to return home, lying in bed thinking: I have been lying in bed for two years, and Beijing has changed greatly. The above are just some of the facts I saw on my first day out, which have made me feel very excited and happy.

Propaganda Work Should Not Take a Narrow Path

Dear Editor:

Recently, the common problem in the thinking of propaganda cadres in the Nanchang Special District is how to closely integrate propaganda work with the central task. Some comrades believe that: "Everyone is concentrating on land reform, and can't take care of it. Propaganda work is dispensable." A considerable number of comrades are therefore distressed. Some comrades who do propaganda work simply go to do other work and give up propaganda work. The reason for these problems, although the leading organs are not paying close attention, I think the main reason is that the propaganda cadres themselves are not doing enough. Propaganda workers often content themselves with issuing instructions and documents, lacking specific guidance to the lower levels, so that propaganda work has taken a narrow path. I think propaganda workers and propaganda cadres in various places should pay attention to overcoming this shortcoming. Propaganda work cadres should seize all opportunities (such as mass and cadre gatherings of all sizes) to cooperate with the central task for propaganda; and fully publicize the policies of the central task and the party's propositions among the masses.

As far as I know, there are several propaganda methods that have achieved great results, and I am willing to introduce them to propaganda workers in various places for reference.

In the land reform movement, holding exhibitions with profound educational significance can achieve good propaganda results. For example, Fengshan Township in the first district of Anyi County once used this method. At the meeting, peasant propagandists explained why landlords do not work but still enjoy such happiness, and why poor peasants work hard all year round but still live such a hard life. Such propaganda greatly stimulated the masses' class consciousness and encouraged the masses' enthusiasm for struggle.

Magic lantern shows, plays, and mobile picture exhibitions are all propaganda methods most welcomed by the masses. In terms of content, we should try our best to obtain the assistance of local folk artists and literary and artistic workers to compile new lyrics for quick rhythm, etc., and carry out propaganda targeted at the actual ideological problems of the masses in the central work.

Using blackboards and mimeographed newspapers for propaganda is also very effective. Anyi County opened up a fixed space in the newspapers to regularly publish blackboard newspaper drafts. All blackboard newspapers in various places uniformly adopt these drafts, so that the propaganda firepower is concentrated, and the dissemination of central work policies and ideas is also faster and more widespread.

Many Casualties in Shanxi Province's Yanbei Small Coal Mines; Relevant Departments Should Conduct Safety Inspections

Dear Editor:

Since the beginning of winter, serious casualties have occurred continuously in the small coal mines of Hunyuan, Shuo County, Zuoyun, Youyu, Huai'ren and other counties under the jurisdiction of the Yanbei Special District of Shanxi Province. Preliminary statistics show that 16 miners were suffocated by gas or crushed to death by falling roofs; it is difficult to count the number of seriously and slightly injured at the moment.

The reason for the above accidents is mainly due to the general neglect of safe production in various mines. Some mine owners only care about high profits, and many necessary safety equipment has not been built. On December 12th, a "runaway" accident occurred at the Fengwan Coal Mine in the first district of Hunyuan due to the lack of body protection boards, and the worker Shang Erdan was killed by the fall. Shang Sandan, Zhang Shun and other six people were injured. Wancheng Rongyao Mine in the first district of Shuo County has never had a kiln gate. Security personnel do not follow the security rules, and the worker Bian Guzhong was therefore killed by fallen shed coal. Due to the lack of safety education, some workers do not abide by safety discipline. When Sihe Kiln in the fifth district of Shuo County built the old lane, it was decided to build the wind road first and then remove the closed wall. However, the security guard Jia Shuzhong did not follow the regulations, and was suffocated by gas when he randomly went to the old lane to seal the door. In the past, many people thought: "There is a disaster when going down the mine, and people will inevitably die!" Under the control of this wrong idea, the past multiple deaths and injuries have not attracted attention; neither has been seriously inspected nor properly handled. As a result, deaths and injuries have occurred continuously since winter. It is recommended that the relevant leading departments conduct a safety inspection on this, and take active and effective measures in response to the existing problems to prevent accidents caused by negligence.

    一个天主教徒的呼声人民日报社：
    我过去是天主教会里的一个中国神父，也曾在教会私立学校里做过十年的小学校长，但自一九五零下半年，因我的政治觉悟，我加入了中国民主同盟。这种进步表现为教会所不容，革除了我的校长职务。
    我自从看了一九五○年九月份报纸上所发表的基督教革新宣言和全国各地基督教徒的爱国运动消息以后，我的心火热地跳起来，恨不得马上变成一个扩音器，好向全国天主教徒呼喊，叫他们也一致起来行动。正在此时，我又看到了四川广元县天主教徒的宣言，我更为兴奋。广元天主教徒的宣言是中国天主教会的爱国呼声中的第一炮，这是中国三百万天主教徒应有的呼声。今天在中国受帝国主义影响最大最久最深的教会就是天主教。帝国主义利用天主教的传教士，用毒辣的奴化教育麻醉教徒，欺骗和诱惑教徒，使中国数百万人民变成了无声无臭的“文化亡国奴”。使有些中国人只知有教不知有国；只知自己是个天主教教友，而不知自己是中国的一个国民；只知信奉天主（上帝），不知爱护祖国；只知服从洋教士而不知敬仰伟大的人民领袖毛主席——中国人民真正的救星；只知作礼拜，不知学习进步，更不知晓国家政策；只会作祷告不会向祖国贡献有用的力量；即便有些觉悟，却不敢坚决行动，……他们努力要把教徒训练的到了这种程度，真是帝国主义的毒辣手段，这完全是帝国主义奴化中国人民的野心。他们用奴化教育和严厉的教规把很多善良的中国人民和千千万万有为的青年，训练成了木头人。然而今天的中国人民已在共产党领导下雄伟地站立起来了，谁还甘心让帝国主义再利用教会继续它们对中国的侵略阴谋？谁还能忍心看着祖国同胞，受帝国主义奴化教育的压迫？今天中国天主教徒都应起来和反动的外国传教士断绝关系，帝国主义绝不能再把祖国的三百万同胞继续压迫欺骗、奴化下去！只有这样才能促进天主教的革新！
    此外还有个意见，望贵报转达，就是广元天主教徒的宣言既然对全国三百万天主教徒有很大的影响。我们就希望全国所有的报纸都能一齐刊登出来。新华社在去年十二月十三日已经发出了这项消息，但我们只在十二月十七日的甘肃日报的一个不醒目的角落上看见了，全国有许多报纸一直到十五六日还没有登，希望能引起有关方面注意。此致热忱的敬礼

            两年，北京变了！编辑同志：
    一九四八年冬人民解放军围攻北京时，我不幸被国民党匪军用枪打伤了腿。因为无钱住医院，只得躺在家中休养；一直到一九五○年底才养好。
    我在床上躺了两年，好像和社会隔绝了一样。在这段时间中，我听到家里的小孩在唱“解放区的天是明朗的天……”街坊的三轮车工人们一说话即提到“解放啦！……”还有和我住同院的一个被服厂女工，过去国民党统治时，常见她满面愁容；自北京解放后，我有时从窗口看见她，她那过去的一副憔悴面孔，已变成一个愉快红润的笑脸了。这一些情形使我感到很奇怪。躺在床上真着急呵，恨不得快一点好了，到街上遛一遛。
    一九五○年底，我的伤快好了；我实在等不及了，手里拉着一根棍子，便慢慢出了胡同。走到东单牌楼，我心里马上一惊，过去由东单往长安街一条不很宽的马路，现在怎么成了又宽又大的两条大道了。正在惊奇的时候，我看到一个骑车的人民解放军同志被地下的雪滑倒了，碰在后边一个骑车的市民身上。我想这位“老总”说不定要拿这位被碰到的老百姓出气了。与我想的正相反！那位解放军同志竟和蔼地向这位市民道歉说：“先生！太对不起了。车子坏了么？坏了我给修理。”这几句话我听了又惊奇、又感动。人民解放军真是老百姓的队伍啊，真和气呵！
    当我拄着棍子过马路时，迎面来了一个交通“警察”。我走不快，心里着急地想：要挨骂了。但，不是的，那位警察看见我是带病的人，就小心翼翼地扶着我过马路，并和气地嘱咐我说：“您慢一点走呵，今天是大年夜，车子特别多，别碰了呵。”我当时想：解放区的天真是明朗的天呀！“兵”、“警察”，都变了。要是在过去国民党统治时，那个骑车市民至少得挨一顿骂，我也一定要挨警察训。我高兴地一步步往王府井大街走去，在青年服务部门口见到挂着毛主席像片。他满脸笑容，好像在对每个市民笑。我在他的像片前停下来，心中生出无限敬意。毛主席：您真把北京改变好了！
    当我站在像片前的时候，看到一群青年学生，由青年服务部出来，一个个面带笑容，嘴里唱着“东方红，太阳升，中国出了一个毛泽东。”我看他们那种心情，高兴得了不得。我又慢慢地走到王府井口，只听鼓声咚咚，来了一群年青小伙子，在打着腰鼓。那些年青小伙子是多么高兴呀！我雇车回到家里，躺在床上想：我在床上躺了两年，北京已经大大地改变了。上面这些只是我第一天出门所看到的一些事实，已经使我感到非常兴奋和愉快。

    宣传工作不要走狭路编辑同志：
    最近一个时期，南昌专区宣传干部思想上普遍存在的问题，是宣传工作如何与中心任务紧密结合。有些同志以为：“大家都在集中力量搞土地改革去了，照顾不过来，宣传工作可做可不做。”相当一部分同志因此而感到苦恼，有的作宣传工作的同志索性单去搞别的工作，放弃宣传工作。发生这些问题的原因，虽然是领导机关抓得不紧，但是我觉得主要还是宣传干部本身做得不够。宣传工作者往往满足于发指示、文件，对下面缺乏具体指导，使宣传工作走了狭路。我觉得各地宣传员及宣传工作干部应注意克服这一缺点。宣传工作干部要抓紧利用一切时机（如群众、干部的大小集会等）配合中心工作进行宣传；在群众中充分地宣传中心工作的政策、党的主张等。
    据我所知道的，有几种宣传方法收效很大，我愿意介绍给各地宣传工作同志们参考。
    在土地改革运动中，举办有深刻教育意义的展览会，可以收到良好的宣传效果。如安义县一区凤山乡就曾用过这种方法。在会上，由农民宣传员说明，为什么地主不劳动还这样享福，为什么贫苦农民辛苦终年还过这样的苦日子。这样的宣传，大大激发了群众的阶级觉悟，鼓舞了群众的斗争热情。
    拉洋片、演剧、画片流动展览等，都是群众最欢迎的宣传方式，在内容上，应尽力取得当地民间艺人及文艺工作者的协助，编写快板等新词，针对着中心工作中群众的实际思想问题，进行宣传。
    利用黑板报与油印小报进行宣传，效果也很好。安义县在小报上辟出固定篇幅，定期刊登黑板报稿子，各地黑板报都统一采用这些稿子，这样，宣传火力集中，对于中心工作政策思想的传播也较迅速普遍。

    察省雁北小窑伤亡事故多  有关部门应进行保安检查编辑同志：
    察省雁北专区所属浑源、朔县、左云、右玉、怀仁等县的小窑，入冬以来连续发生严重的伤亡事故。初步统计：被煤气熏死，顶板陷落砸死的矿工十六人；重伤、轻伤的一时难以统计。
    发生以上事故的原因，主要是由于各窑普遍忽视安全生产，某些窑主只图厚利，许多必要的保安设备都没有修建。浑源一区冯湾煤窑由于没有修建护身板，十二月十二日发生“跑道”事故，工人尚二旦被摔死，尚三旦、张顺等六人被摔伤。朔县一区万成荣窑一直没有窑门，保安人员不按照保安规则办事，工人边估忠因此被掉下来的棚炭砸死。由于缺乏保安教育，有些工友不遵守保安纪律。朔县五区四合窑修筑老巷，确定先筑风路然后搬除封闭的墙，但保安员贾书忠不遵守规定，乱窜至老巷封门时，被煤气熏死。过去许多人认为：“下窑三分灾，不能不死人！”在这一错误思想支配下，使过去多次的死伤事故没引起重视；既未认真检查，也没有妥善处理。以致冬季以来连续发生死伤事故。建议有关领导部门，对此进行一次保安检查，针对现存问题，采取积极、有效的措施，以杜绝责任事故。
