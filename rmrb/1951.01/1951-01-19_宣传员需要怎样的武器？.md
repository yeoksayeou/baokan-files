What Kind of Weapons Do Propagandists Need?
　　　　Lí Shù

　　There are currently 117,823 propagandists in factories, cities, and rural areas in the Northeast region. It is estimated that this number will increase to 200,000 in the first quarter of 1951. The large-scale development of propagandists makes the supply of propaganda materials an important and widespread problem.

　　What kind of propaganda materials can achieve the most effective propaganda among the masses? The delegates attending the recent first Northeast Regional Propaganda Worker Representative Conference are a mirror of the various propaganda materials currently available. According to their opinions, the "Current Affairs Handbook" published by the People's Publishing House and the "Propagandist Handbook" published by the Northeast Xinhua Bookstore are both very good in content and popular with readers, but both are difficult to specifically address the different needs of provinces, cities, localities, and counties. The questions answered in the "Current Affairs Handbook" are very important, but the vast majority of propagandists cannot understand them. Staff members of the provincial and municipal Party committee propaganda departments said that the "Current Affairs Handbook" can be used as a handbook for reporters, propagandists with intermediate education, and general readers to study current affairs, but it cannot be used as a handbook for the majority of propagandists. There are very few propagandists in the Northeast region with intermediate education. Some propagandists are even illiterate, such as Wu Jin Feng (Old Lady Wu), a resident propagandist in Dalian, and Wang Weisheng, the deputy propaganda committee member of Shangjiatai Village Branch in Yingkou County, Liaodong Province, who are both outstanding propagandists in their localities but cannot read (Wang Weisheng often asks someone to draft an outline before giving a speech. This outline is not written in words, but in pictures). Most propagandists have a low level of education. It is a conceivable challenge for them to digest the contents of the "Propagandist Handbook" or the "Current Affairs Handbook" and combine them with local conditions to carry out propaganda to the masses. This digestion work should be done by the Party committees of provinces, cities, localities, and counties. The Party committees of provinces, cities, localities, and counties should prepare propaganda materials for their propagandists that are easy to understand as soon as they are read, according to the different conditions and needs of the locality. Under the current conditions, it may be difficult for the provincial or municipal Party committees to publish local propagandist handbooks. However, in places where there are newspapers, such as provinces and cities, the newspapers can be used to publish columns of "Propagandist Speech Materials," and in places where there are no newspapers, such as counties, speech material leaflets can also be printed and distributed regularly. According to staff members of the propaganda departments of provinces and cities in the Northeast region, these speech materials must be lecture drafts. They believe that the reason why many propaganda materials fail to play a direct propaganda role is that they are aimed at propagandists as propaganda targets, rather than the masses.

　　From the experience of many propagandists, we can see the people's love for poetry and rhymes. Among the delegates who made typical presentations at this Northeast Regional Propaganda Worker Representative Conference, several were able to perform kuaiban (clapper talk) or sing dagu (a type of ballad singing). The masses often welcome them especially because they can perform kuaiban or sing dagu, and they are more likely to accept their propaganda. However, some of these impromptu kuaiban or ballad lyrics are incorrect, with factual errors or politically unstable grasp. Therefore, the propaganda materials supplied by Party organizations at all levels should not be limited to speech materials, but should also include poetry and rhymes. These poems and rhymes must take forms that are customary and popular with the masses. In the words of the propagandist representatives of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, they should "not be literary." The vast majority of higher-level literary works are, at least for the time being, not appreciated by the broad masses.

　　Pictures are also a very important part of propaganda materials. Representatives of industrial, mining, and rural propagandists from Anshan, Benxi, Heilongjiang, and Inner Mongolia unanimously agreed that pictures, photos, and maps are powerful weapons in the work of propagandists. However, cartoons have little effect among workers and peasants. They said that cartoons are too complicated, and propagandists themselves and the workers and peasants around them cannot understand them. For example, many propagandist representatives could not understand the cartoons "Year-End Account Settlement" and "Air Force Headquarters" by Hua Junwu reprinted from the People's Daily in the tenth issue of the "Propagandist Handbook." To understand these cartoons, a lot of explanation must be added. Some workers and peasants even think that cartoons are nonsense and refuse to believe them. What is welcomed by workers and peasants are realistic paintings and story paintings. The welcome of picture books by workers and staff in a factory in Anshan is an illustrative fact. Among the workers and staff in the factory, there are already 89 propagandists. There are more than 2,000 books in the factory, including more than 400 picture books, and each book is worn out due to too many readers. Not only workers are readers of picture books, but also higher-level technicians, staff, and cadres are also readers of picture books. A factory director often delays sleep because he is greedy for reading picture books. Worker representatives said that workers and staff like things that are "complete." The popularity of picture books, "completeness" is an important condition. Anshan Theater performed a series of plays "Water Margin", changing one book every week, and it was full for more than half a year, also because the play was "complete."

　　Propagandist representatives from Zhaoyuan County, Heilongjiang Province, used their experience to prove the rural masses' love for pictures. Working group cadres in the county brought a roll of propaganda paintings or maps with them when they went to the countryside, and referred to the pictures as evidence during speeches, or held discussions after looking at the pictures. They found that this kind of propaganda meeting, similar to opening an art exhibition, was particularly powerful. Many rural women shed tears after seeing a picture of an infant sucking milk in front of its mother who was killed in bombing, which was copied by propagandists from the People's Daily, deepening their hatred for American imperialist atrocities in Korea. Many farmers in Zhaoyuan County did not know that the American invaders had reached the border of our country until they saw a map of the Korean War brought by propagandists in November last year. They said in surprise, "Only that far away? We must fight them!" They knew that there was a "Goryeo (Korea) country," but they didn't know how far "Goryeo country" was from China. The Zhaoyuan County propagandist representatives said that if local things could be drawn, it would be very effective in promoting local work, because real people and real things, even if the painting technique is far inferior to that of a cultivated painter, it is easy to arouse the interest of the rural masses. The working group in the county imitated the lantern and made a propaganda tool called "Glass Shadow." They used pieces of palm-sized glass to coat with thick ink, and then used tacks to engrave pictures about domestic and foreign or local current affairs. They were installed in the front end of a wooden box of considerable size, and a light stick was used to illuminate it from behind. A picture of fifty times magnification appeared in front of the curtain. This kind of propaganda tool obviously would not be of much use in the city, but it was extremely popular with the audience in the countryside. There are currently 90 places in the county that use this propaganda tool. The number of glass pieces has increased to more than 3,500. It has been screened 303 times, with 76,900 audiences. The most audience in a scene reached 1,200, which is equivalent to the audience of a movie screening in the city.

　　These facts show that the demand for culture from workers and peasants is extremely large. As long as the Party organizations at all levels implement the Central Committee's instruction to "be good at coordinating with various democratic parties and people's organizations, and organize the staff of the People's Government, the People's Liberation Army, the cultural circles, the education circles, and the art circles to participate together," and ensure the supply of appropriate propaganda materials, we will have a fully armed propaganda team, and the effect of the work of the propagandists will continue to be strengthened.

　　宣传员需要怎样的武器？
    黎澍
    东北区各地工厂、城市和农村现有宣传员十一万七千八百二十三人。预计在一九五一年第一季将发展到二十万人。宣传员的大量的发展，使宣传资料的供应成为一个重要的和具有普遍意义的问题。
    什么样的宣传资料最能在群众中发挥宣传的效果？出席最近举行的东北区第一次宣传员代表会议的代表们是现在已有的各种宣传资料的一面镜子。按照他们的意见，现有各种宣传资料为人民出版社出版的《时事手册》和东北新华书店出版的《宣传员手册》，前者是全国性的，后者是大行政区的，内容都很好，很受读者欢迎，但是都难于具体地照顾到各省、市、地方和县的不同的需要。《时事手册》所回答的问题是很重要的，但是绝大多数宣传员还不能够读懂。各省市委宣传部工作人员说，《时事手册》可以成一种供给报告员和有中等文化程度的宣传员以及一般读者学习时事用的手册，但是还不能当作大多数宣传员的手册。东北区的宣传员还很少是具有中等文化程度的，有些宣传员甚至是文盲，如大连的居民宣传员吴金凤同志（吴老太太）和辽东省营口县商家台村支部副宣传委员王维盛同志都是当地的出色的宣传员，然而都不识字（王维盛同志常常在他发表演说以前请人拟好一个提纲，这个提纲不是用文字写的，而是用图画来表示的）。大部分宣传员文化程度都很低，要他们消化《宣传员手册》或《时事手册》的内容结合当地情况来向群众进行宣传，是一个可想而知的难题。这个消化工作应当由各省、市、地方和县的党的委员会来作。各省、市、地方和县的党的委员会应当按照当地的不同的情况和需要为自己的宣传员准备文字通俗、一念就懂的宣传员讲话材料。在目前条件下，由省的或市的党的委员会出版地方性的宣传员手册也许是有困难的。但是在有报纸的地方如各省、市，便可以利用报纸发表《宣传员讲话材料》的专栏，在没有报纸的地方如各县，也可以经常印发讲话材料的单页。这种讲话材料，据东北区各省市宣传部工作人员说，必须是演讲稿。他们认为有许多宣传材料之不能发挥直接的宣传作用，原因就在于它们是以宣传员为宣传对象，而不是以人民群众为宣传对象的。
    从很多宣传员的经验可以看到人民群众对于诗歌和韵语的爱好。在这次东北区宣传员代表会议作典型介绍的代表们，就有好几位是会说快板或唱大鼓的。群众往往由于他们会说快板或唱大鼓而特别欢迎他们，容易接受他们的宣传。但这种即景生情编就的快板或鼓词，有些是不正确的，事实有误或政治上掌握不稳。因此，各级党组织所供给的宣传资料不应当限于讲话材料，还应当包括诗歌和韵语。这种诗歌和韵语必须采取为群众所习惯的和喜闻乐见的形式，用鞍山钢铁公司的宣传员代表们的话来说，就是“不要带文艺性”。绝大多数较高级的文艺作品至少在目前还不是广大群众所能欣赏的。
    图画同样是宣传资料中很重要的一部分。鞍山、本溪、黑龙江和内蒙的工矿和农村宣传员代表一致承认图画、照片和地图是宣传员工作中的有力的武器。但是漫画在工农群众中很少作用。他们说，漫画太复杂，宣传员自己和他们周围的工农群众都看不懂。比如《宣传员手册》第十期从人民日报转载的华君武所作漫画《年关结账》和《“空军”司令部》，就有许多宣传员代表看不懂。要看懂这些漫画，必须加上很多解释。有些工农群众并且认为漫画胡扯，不肯相信。为工农群众所欢迎的图画是写实画和故事画。鞍山某厂工人和职员对于小人书的欢迎是一个富有说明意义的事实。在该厂的工人和职员中，已有宣传员八十九人。厂内存有图书二千多本，其中有小人书四百多本，每一本都因读者过多而破烂不堪。不但工人是小人书的读者，较高级的技术人员、职员和干部也是小人书的读者。该厂的一个场长常常因为贪读小人书，耽误了睡眠。工人代表们说，工人和职员都喜爱“有头有尾”的东西。小人书受欢迎，“有头有尾”是一个重要条件。鞍山一戏院上演连台戏《水泊梁山》，每星期换演一本，演了半年多，场场客满，也因为这个戏是“有头有尾”的。
    从黑龙江肇源县农村到来的宣传员代表用他们的经验证明了农村群众对于图画的爱好。该县工作组干部下乡都随带一卷宣传画或地图，在演讲的时候指图画为证，或在看画以后进行座谈。他们发现这种类似开画展的宣传会特别有力量。许多农村妇女看了宣传员从人民日报摹下的一幅婴孩在被炸死了的母亲胸前吃奶的美国侵略军在朝鲜的暴行图，流下泪来，加深了对于美帝国主义的仇恨心理。肇源县许多农民在去年十一月看到宣传员带去的朝鲜战事地图才知道美国侵略军打到了我国边境，惊讶地说：“只隔这么远？非跟他干一场不可！”他们从知道有个“高丽国”，可不知道“高丽国”距离中国有多远。肇源县宣传员代表说，如果能画本地事情，对于推动本地工作有很大效果，因为实人实事，那怕绘画技术远不如一个有修养的画家，也容易引起农村群众的兴趣。该县工作组仿照幻灯制作了一种名为“玻璃影”的宣传工具，用一块一块手掌大小的玻璃片涂上浓墨，然后用洋钉在上面刻出关于国内外或本地时事的图画，装进一个大小相当的木匣的前端，用一支电棒从后面照过去，布幕前即现出放大五十倍的一张图画。这种宣传工具在城市显然不会有多大作用，但在农村极受观众欢迎。该县现有九十处使用这种宣传工具，玻璃片增加到三千五百多块，放映三百○三次，观众七万六千九百人，观众最多的一场达一千二百人，相当于城市放映一场电影的观众。
    这些事实说明工人和农民对于文化的需要量是极大的。只要各级党的组织执行中央所指示的“善于和各民主党派、各人民团体协同动作，并组织人民政府、人民解放军、文化界、教育界、艺术界的工作人员一致参加”，保证适当的宣传资料的供应，我们将可以有一个完全武装好的宣传队伍，宣传员工作的效果将不断地加强起来。
