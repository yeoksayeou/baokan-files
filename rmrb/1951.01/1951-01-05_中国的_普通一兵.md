China's "Ordinary Soldier"

In the People's Liberation Army, there has emerged a people's hero comparable to the Soviet hero Matrosov, who used his body to block the machine gun of the German invaders during the Great Patriotic War. His name is Wang Yushan. He was seriously wounded in a bandit suppression operation but insisted on staying on the front line. He even used his body to block the machine gun of stubborn bandits, allowing the bandit suppression troops to reduce casualties and quickly annihilate the bandit gang.

On the morning of October 12th, just as dawn was breaking, Wang Yushan's battalion, after marching all night and traveling more than 100 li, unexpectedly surrounded Zhouwu Village, the lair of the bandit "Guangdong People's Anti-Communist National Salvation Army" 12th Detachment, located 80 li northeast of Qin County. After the attack began, the troops divided into several routes and rushed into the village. One of the routes encountered stubborn resistance from the enemy after entering the village. This group of stubborn bandits occupied a large courtyard, using thick walls as cover, and blocked the road with three machine guns firing from loopholes in the walls. Three platoons in a row were blocked and unable to advance, and the platoon leader gloriously sacrificed himself at this time. Wang Yushan, the leader of the seventh squad, saw this situation and was determined to eliminate this enemy firing point. He loudly encouraged all the soldiers in the squad, saying, "Charge! Avenge the platoon leader!" He was the first to jump up, holding a submachine gun and rushing forward bravely. When Wang Yushan was about to rush close to the wall, he was hit in the left arm by the enemy's machine gun and fell to the ground seriously wounded. At this time, all the soldiers in the platoon had also followed him and rushed up, exposed to the enemy's fire. At this critical moment, Wang Yushan suddenly jumped up, enduring the pain, and rushed towards the enemy's frontal machine gun port. He raised his backpack with his right hand and blocked the machine gun port that was spitting fire. The machine gun stopped firing. The enemy tried hard to push the gun barrel outward, trying to push the backpack away. Wang Yushan, seeing that one hand could not hold on, pressed his whole body on the backpack, desperately blocking the enemy's machine gun port. In that instant, the troops rushed up, blew open the courtyard wall with explosives, rushed into the courtyard, and completely annihilated this group of enemies, and quickly cooperated with other comrades to completely wipe out the stubborn bandits. A total of more than one hundred bandits were killed, wounded, and captured, and Huang Guanfeng, the political department director of the bandit "Guangdong People's Anti-Communist National Salvation Army" 12th Detachment, was captured alive.

Wang Yushan participated in the battle to liberate Hainan Island and was one of the thirteen heroes of the "Crossing the Sea Hero Company." This time, he maintained and carried forward his past glory in the bandit suppression operation. His heroic deeds have been commended by the leaders of the unit and the Guangdong Military Region in a circular to the entire army. The Fourth Field Army Warrior News Agency specially published a commentary calling on the entire army to learn from Wang Yushan's spirit of patriotism and revolutionary heroism.

Now, after more than a month of treatment, Wang Yushan's injuries have gradually recovered. [Xinhua News Agency]

### 中国的“普通一兵”

　　中国的“普通一兵”
    人民解放军中出现了一位可以与苏联卫国战争中以身体挡塞德寇机枪口的英雄马特洛索夫媲美的人民英雄，他的名字叫王玉山。他在一次剿匪作战中负了重伤，但坚持不下火线，还以自己的身体，堵塞住顽匪的机枪口，使剿匪部队得以减轻伤亡，并迅速地全部歼灭了匪股。
    十月十二日早晨，天刚微明，王玉山所在的某营，在经过了整整一夜的行军，走了一百多里路之后，出敌不意地把钦县城东偏北八十里处的匪“广东民众反共救国军”第十二支队盘踞的老巢周屋村包围了。攻击开始后，部队分成几路冲进了村子。其中有一路进村后遇到了敌人的顽抗。这股顽匪据守着一座大院，凭借厚墙为掩护，从枪眼里用三挺机枪封锁着道路。一连三排被阻不能前进，三排长在这时光荣牺牲了。七班长王玉山看到这情形，决心要消灭这个敌人的火力点。他大声地鼓动全班战士说：“冲呀，替排长报仇！”他首先跳了起来，端着冲锋枪勇猛地冲上前去。当王玉山快要冲近墙的时候，他被敌人的机枪打中了左臂，重伤倒地。这时，全排战士也都已经跟着他冲了上来，暴露在敌人火力下。在这千钧一发的时候，王玉山猛然跳了起来，忍着剧痛，向敌人的正面机枪射口扑去。他用右手举起自己的背包，堵住了敌人正面的正吐着火舌的机枪口。这挺机枪的射击停止了。敌人用力把枪筒向外猛推，想把背包推开。王玉山眼看一只手撑不住了，他就把整个身体都压在背包上，拚命地堵塞着敌人的机枪口。就在这一瞬间，部队冲上来了，用炸药炸开了院墙，冲进了院子，将这一股敌人彻底消灭了，并且迅速配合其它各路战友，全歼顽匪。共计打死、打伤和俘掳了一百多个土匪，活捉了匪首“广东民众反共救国军”十二支队政治部主任黄冠峰。
    王玉山参加过解放海南岛的战役，而且是“渡海英雄连”十三勇士之一。这次他在剿匪作战中保持并发扬了过去的光荣。他这种英雄事迹，获得了该部首长和广东军区通令全军的嘉奖。第四野战军战士报社特发表评论，号召全军向王玉山的爱国主义和革命英雄主义的精神学习。
    现在，王玉山的伤势经过一个多月的治疗后，已逐渐痊愈。【新华社】
