The Road to a Genuine Peaceful Resolution of the Korean Issue

On January 17th, Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of China, replied to the Chairman of the First Committee (i.e., the Political and Security Committee) of the United Nations General Assembly, answering the committee's principles on the Korean and other Far Eastern issues, and put forward significant proposals for a genuine peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and important issues in Asia. This involved holding negotiations in China among seven countries—the People's Republic of China, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, the United States, France, India, and Egypt—based on the agreement to withdraw all foreign troops from Korea and allowing the Korean people to resolve their own internal affairs, in order to quickly end the Korean War. Foreign Minister Zhou also pointed out that the negotiations must include the withdrawal of U.S. armed forces from Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait, and related Far Eastern issues. At the same time, the legitimate status of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations should be confirmed from the time the seven-nation conference is held. Minister Zhou's proposals embodied the consistent desire of the Chinese people for a genuine peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and important issues in Asia, and it is a just and reasonable way to quickly end the Korean War and restore peace in the Far East.

Contrary to the consistent peaceful wishes of the Chinese people, U.S. imperialism attempted to use the United Nations to continue and expand its aggression against the Chinese and Korean people. However, this conspiracy has suffered and will continue to suffer a shameful defeat.

As early as last December, when the Chinese People's Volunteers began fighting side by side with the Korean People's Army, the United States had already gathered six vassal states at the United Nations General Assembly to propose a slanderous indictment against our People's Republic of China for so-called "interference in Korea," attempting to find an excuse to expand its aggression against China. But as a result, this proposal by the United States could not be discussed at the meeting because it did not receive enough support from the member states of the United Nations, and had to be shelved by itself. Later, when the Chinese and Korean People's forces launched a major counter-offensive, the United States instigated the United Nations General Assembly to illegally pass a resolution establishing a "Korean Armistice Three-Person Committee," unreasonably demanding an "immediate ceasefire" in Korea first, in order to buy breathing time for the retreating U.S. invading forces and wait for an opportunity to make a comeback. But under the resolute condemnation of the Chinese people and the people of the world, this trick of U.S. imperialism was once again bankrupt. At the beginning of this year, the United States again attempted to manipulate the United Nations to pass a resolution falsely accusing our People's Republic of China as an "aggressor" and imposing "economic and diplomatic sanctions" against our country. To this end, the U.S. State Department specifically notified 30 countries, including Britain and France, in an attempt to coerce them into supporting the U.S. conspiracy. But this move by the United States was met with "general indifference" from many countries.

Recently, the First Committee of the United Nations General Assembly passed the so-called "Three-Person Committee's" principles on the Korean and other Far Eastern issues, suggesting a ceasefire in Korea first, and then holding negotiations between the countries concerned. The United States is attempting to use the principle of "ceasefire first, then negotiate" to continue to buy breathing time for its invading forces. This conspiracy has been exposed in Foreign Minister Zhou's reply to the First Committee of the UN General Assembly.

Currently, U.S. imperialism is trying to pressure its vassal states to save its precarious situation in Korea. U.S. imperialism has obviously not learned its lesson from a series of defeats and still wants to continue its bankrupt policy of aggression against Korea and China. However, it can be predicted that the imperialist camp, full of divisions and chaos, will never be able to give U.S. imperialism a shot in the arm under the powerful blows of the people of the world. The more U.S. imperialism insists on aggression, the more miserable its defeat will be.

The New Surge of the Western European Peace Movement

Encouraged by the great victories of the Chinese and Korean people, the peace movement in Western Europe has reached a new high. This movement is centered on opposing the rearmament of West Germany and the establishment of a unified aggressive army. It has given a serious blow to the aggressive plans of U.S. imperialism, and the chaos and division within the imperialist camp have become more and more extensive. The recent experience of U.S. war-monger Eisenhower in Western Europe is the best proof.

Eisenhower left the United States for Europe on the 6th of this month with the mission of establishing a unified aggressive army to step up preparations for war in Europe. In the past ten days or so, he has traveled to all the North Atlantic Treaty countries in Western Europe, but what he has encountered is the strong fire of hatred of the war-mongers by the people of Western Europe. Wherever Eisenhower went, the shouts of "Eisenhower go home!" and "We will never fight alongside the Nazis!" were heard everywhere.

Before Eisenhower arrived in France, the French working people had already launched a massive protest movement. When he arrived in Paris, he encountered a surging protest demonstration by the people of Paris. Although the streets were heavily guarded, he had to take a detour; and the officially arranged welcome ceremony had to be canceled. On January 9th, the people of Paris held a full day of demonstrations and strikes. In the Netherlands and Denmark, Eisenhower also encountered angry people singing anti-Nazi resistance songs and shouting slogans of defending peace. In the United Kingdom, the broad masses of the people responded to the call of the British Communist Party's Political Committee and held grand demonstrations on the 13th and 14th. In Italy, as soon as the news of Eisenhower's arrival spread, strikes and rallies and demonstrations were held all over the country. After Eisenhower arrived, Italian workers held a general strike of protest despite the authorities' harsh suppression. In West Germany, which serves as the central base for U.S. war plans, the movement calling for peaceful unification and opposing rearmament has also made great progress. More and more West Germans, including some members of the bourgeoisie, have responded to the German Democratic Republic Premier Grotewohl's suggestion to the West German "Chancellor" Adenauer to establish a pan-German constitutional assembly. The movement against rearmament has become more and more widespread. Even West German "Deputy Chancellor" Blücher admitted in panic: "Ninety-nine percent of the people of West Germany are against re-militarization."

In view of the disastrous defeat of the imperialist aggressor army in Korea and the further development of the Western European people's peace movement, the tendency within the ruling groups of Western European countries to demand that they not be too deeply involved in the U.S.'s adventurous policies and adopt a "neutral line" has become increasingly apparent. In the ruling groups of these countries, some people who were originally dissatisfied with the extremely vicious aggressive mood of the United States are now daring to openly express this sentiment. After the so-called "neutralist movement" and "independent line" appeared in parts of the bourgeoisie in France and the United Kingdom, similar signs have recently even occurred within the West German and Italian bourgeoisie that are under strict U.S. military control and fostered by the U.S. In West Germany, even the British Conservative Party's Daily Mail admitted that newspapers which only a few months ago were clearly in favor of attaching themselves to the United States, are now "gradually showing a neutral trend." In Italy, the speaker of the lower house of the ruling Christian Democratic Party, Gronchi, recently even demanded that the extremely pro-American Foreign Minister Sforza, Finance Minister Bella, and Defense Minister Bazzia Di be removed from the cabinet. According to a Teletype report: Currently, "the characteristic of the development of the domestic political situation in Italy is a wide-ranging discussion about the need to adopt a new foreign policy, and is particularly marked by the chaos and contradictions within the Italian government."

These facts in Western Europe show that the power of the Western people to defend peace is growing rapidly. The imperialist camp is increasingly disintegrating. It has become increasingly difficult for the United States to use Western Europe as a base for launching aggressive wars.

What Did the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference Indicate?

Another example marking the disintegration of the imperialist camp is the British Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference held in London from January 4th to 12th. The main characteristic of this conference was that both Anglo-American relations and the relations within the Commonwealth group were divided by insurmountable contradictions. The Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference "unquestionably resulted in the further aggravation of contradictions, rather than the strengthening of unity" (Pravda commentary).

The nine-day conference mainly discussed the following two issues: one was the situation in the Far East centered on the Korean War and policy towards China, as well as the common countermeasures of the British Commonwealth group; and the other was the so-called "defense" of the Commonwealth group from the Middle East to the Pacific. The contradiction between Britain and the United States was concentrated on the first issue. According to the United Press, when the conference discussed the Eastern issue, the participants had "increasingly more criticisms of the U.S. Far East policy." The conference expressed great shock and indifference to the U.S. request to falsely accuse China as an "aggressor." The conference showed that Britain was trying to break free from the shackles of the U.S.'s adventurous policies. According to Reuters, which often reflects the official views of Britain, "the general opinion at the meeting was that although the Commonwealth should cooperate closely with the United States, the United States' policies should not involve the Commonwealth countries too deeply, especially in the Far East." The reason why Britain wanted to do this was on the one hand because Britain was afraid that the U.S.'s adventurous policies in the Far East would bring disastrous consequences to itself. According to an Agence France-Presse report on the 8th, Britain feared that following the U.S.'s Far East policy would shake its rule in its Southeast Asian colonies. Britain and its Commonwealth countries "unanimously hoped to maintain Southeast Asia and prevent it from being affected by the Korean War." On the other hand, Britain also attempted to take advantage of the U.S.'s disastrous defeat in Korea to raise its own status.

However, Britain's dependence on the United States in world affairs is too deep, and it still has to rely on "U.S. aid." Therefore, although Britain tries to break free from the U.S.'s "entanglement" in Far Eastern affairs based on its own interests, at the same time, it has to please the United States and try to arrange a so-called "glorious" ending to the Korean issue for the United States. Nevertheless, the profound divisions that exist between Britain and the United States can no longer be covered up by any "close cooperation."

The divisions and contradictions within the British Commonwealth were concentrated in the discussion of the so-called "defense" issue. On this issue, Britain originally intended to transfer more of the burden of its expansion of armaments to the heads of the various autonomous territories, requiring Pakistan to be responsible for the Middle East, India to be responsible for Southeast Asia, and Australia and New Zealand to be responsible for the "defense" of Hong Kong and Malaya. However, this plan of Britain was met with fierce resistance from its autonomous territory partners. India, Pakistan, and Ceylon repeatedly refused to participate in the two meetings to discuss the "defense" issue, and Australia and New Zealand, who participated in the meeting, also emphasized the difficulties of their manpower and material resources, and stated that they could not replace Britain's "defense" in Hong Kong and Malaya. In this way, the "defense" issue, which was originally one of the main topics of the meeting, ended hastily in complete failure.

The conference decided to follow the U.S.'s policy on the Japanese issue and agreed to the U.S.'s plan to quickly conclude a peace treaty with Japan and rearm Japan. However, the agreement of the British Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference on this issue is nothing more than a piece of waste paper. Like the solution of the Korean issue, any solution to the Japanese issue is fundamentally impossible without the participation of the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union.

    真正和平解决朝鲜问题的道路
    一月十七日，我国中央人民政府外交部周恩来部长复电联合国大会第一委员会（即政治及安全委员会）主席，答复该委员会关于朝鲜及其他远东诸问题的各项原则意见，并提出了真正和平解决朝鲜问题和亚洲重要问题的重大建议，即在同意从朝鲜撤退一切外国军队及朝鲜内政由朝鲜人民自己解决的基础上，由中华人民共和国、苏联、英国、美国、法国、印度和埃及七国在中国举行谈判，以迅速结束朝鲜战争。周外长并指出：谈判内容必须包括美国武装力量从台湾及台湾海峡撤退和远东有关问题。同时，中华人民共和国在联合国的合法地位亦即从举行七国会议之时起予以确定。周外长所提出的这些建议，体现了中国人民为着朝鲜问题和亚洲重要问题真能获得和平解决的一贯意愿，它是迅速结束朝鲜战争和恢复远东和平的公正合理的办法。
    与中国人民历来的这种和平愿望相反，美帝国主义企图利用联合国以继续进行并扩大对中朝人民侵略的阴谋。但是，这种阴谋已经遭受而且必将继续遭受可耻的失败。
    早在去年十二月，当我国人民志愿军开始与朝鲜人民军并肩作战之初，美国即曾在联合国大会上纠集六个仆从国家提出了诬蔑我中华人民共和国的所谓“干涉朝鲜”的诽谤案，妄图为扩大侵略中国寻找借口，但结果美国这一提案竟因为得不到联合国各会员国足够的支持而无法在会上讨论，以致不得不自行予以搁置。其后，当中朝人民部队大举反攻之时，美国又唆使联合国大会非法通过成立“朝鲜停战三人委员会”的决议，无理地提出了在朝鲜首先“立即停战”的要求，为节节败退的美国侵朝军骗取喘息时间，以便待机卷土重来。但是在中国人民与世界人民的坚决唾弃下，美帝国主义的这个诡计又再度破产。至今年年初，美国又企图操纵联合国通过决议，诬指我中华人民共和国为“侵略者”，并对我国实行“经济制裁和外交制裁”。为此，美国国务院曾特别通知英、法等三十个国家，企图胁迫它们支持美国的阴谋。但是美国这一举动却受到许多国家的“普遍冷淡”。
    最近联合国大会第一委员会又通过了所谓“三人委员会”关于朝鲜及其他远东诸问题所提出的各项原则，建议先在朝鲜停战，然后举行有关各国的谈判。美国企图利用“先停战后谈判”的这一原则，继续为其侵略军骗取喘息时间。这一阴谋已受到我周外长致联大第一委员会复电的揭露。
    目前美帝国主义正力图压迫它的仆从国家，挽救它在朝鲜所处的危局。美帝国主义显然还没有从一连串的失败中得到教训，仍想继续它的已经破产的侵略朝鲜和中国的政策。然而，可以预料，充满着分歧与混乱的帝国主义阵营，在世界人民的有力打击下，绝不可能替美帝国主义打什么强心针。美帝国主义越是坚持侵略，它失败得就越惨重。
  西欧和平运动的新高涨
    在中朝人民伟大胜利的鼓舞下，西欧人民的和平运动已得到了新的高涨，这一运动是以反对武装西德和建立统一侵略军为中心，它已给了美帝国主义的侵略计划以严重打击，使帝国主义阵营内部的混乱和分裂更趋于扩大。美国战争贩子艾森豪威尔最近在西欧的遭遇，是最好的证明。
    艾森豪威尔是负着建立统一侵略军以加紧在欧洲备战的使命于本月六日离美赴欧的。十多天来，他已走遍了西欧的北大西洋公约各国，但所碰到的，却是西欧人民对战争贩子的强烈的仇恨之火。艾森豪威尔所到之处，到处喊出了“艾森豪威尔滚回去！”“我们决不与纳粹并肩作战！”的呼声。
    在艾森豪威尔抵达法国以前，法国劳动人民已展开了声势浩大的抗议运动。他抵达巴黎时，遇到了声势汹涌的巴黎人民的抗议示威，虽然街头戒备森严，但竟不得不绕道而行；而事前布置好的官方欢迎仪式也不得不取消。一月九日，巴黎人民又举行了整整一天的大示威和大罢工。在荷兰和丹麦，艾森豪威尔同样碰到了高唱着反纳粹的抵抗运动歌、高呼着保卫和平的口号的愤怒人民。在英国，广大人民响应英共政治委员会的号召，在十三、十四两日连续举行了盛大示威。在意大利，艾森豪威尔要来的消息刚一传出，全国各地即纷纷罢工集会，示威游行；艾森豪威尔抵达后，意大利工人又不顾当局的严厉镇压，举行了抗议总罢工。在作为美国战争计划的中心基地的西德，要求和平统一和反对重新武装的运动，也有了巨大的发展。愈来愈多的西德人民，包括一部分资产阶级在内，都响应了德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥向西德“总理”阿登纳发出建立全德立宪议会的建议。反对重新武装的运动已愈来愈普遍，这连西德“副总理”布吕契也惶恐地承认：“西德人民有百分之九十九是反对重新军国主义化的。”
    鉴于帝国主义侵略军在朝鲜的惨败和西欧人民和平运动的进一步发展，西欧各国统治集团内部要求不要过深地被牵到美国冒险政策中去而采取“中立路线”的倾向，已日益显著。这些国家的统治集团中，原先就对美国穷凶恶极的侵略心情不满的一部分人，现在已敢于公开表露这种情绪。在法国与英国的一部分资产阶级中出现了所谓“中立主义运动”、“独立路线”以后，最近甚至在美国严密的军事控制下的西德与为美国扶植起来的意大利资产阶级的内部，都发生了同样的迹象。在西德，连英国保守党的每日邮报都承认，在仅仅几个月前还很分明地赞成依附美国的报纸，现在也“已在渐渐显出了一种中立趋势”。在意大利，执政的基督教民主党的下院议长格隆齐，最近竟要求把内阁中极端亲美的外长史佛卓、财长贝拉和国防部长巴齐亚地撤职。据电通社指出：目前“意大利国内政治形势发展的特征，是对于有必要采取一个新的外交政策一事的广泛讨论，而且特别以意大利政府内部的混乱与矛盾为其标志。”
    在西欧发生的这些事实表明：西方人民保卫和平的力量正迅速增长。帝国主义阵营则日益分崩离析。美国要把西欧作为发动侵略战争的基地，已越来越困难了。
  联邦总理会议表示了什么？
    标志着帝国主义阵营分崩离析的另一实例，是一月四日至十二日在伦敦召开的不列颠联邦总理会议。这次会议的主要特点是英美之间与联邦集团内部之间，都被不可克服的矛盾分裂着。联邦总理会议“无可争辩的结局，是矛盾的进一步加剧，而不是统一的加强”（真理报评论）。
    这次历时九天的会议，主要讨论了下列两个问题：一个是以朝鲜战争，对华政策为中心的远东形势问题，以及英国联邦集团的共同对策问题，另一个是联邦集团由中东到太平洋的所谓“防务”问题。英美之间的矛盾集中表现在第一个问题上。据合众社透露：当会议讨论东方问题时，与会者“对美国的远东政策有着愈来愈多的抨击”。会议对美国要求诬蔑中国为“侵略者”的照会，表示很大的震惊和冷淡。会议表明：英国企图摆脱美国冒险政策的束缚。据经常反映英官方意见的路透社透露：会议中的“一般意见认为，联邦虽应与美国密切合作，但不应使美国的政策把联邦国家牵累太深，特别在远东”。英国所以要这样做，一方面因为英国害怕美国在远东的冒险政策会给自己带来灾难性的后果。据法新社八日电透露：英国恐惧追随美国的远东政策将会动摇它在东南亚殖民地的统治，英国及其联邦各国“一致希望保持东南亚，不使它受到朝鲜战争的波及”。另一方面，英国又企图乘美国在朝鲜惨败之危，抬高一下自己的身价。
    但是，英国在世界事务中对美国的依赖太深，还不能不继续依靠“美援”，因此，英国根据自身的利害虽然力图首先在远东事务中摆脱美国的“牵累”，但是，同时又不能不讨好一下美国，企图为美国安排一个解决朝鲜问题的所谓“光荣的”收场。尽管如此，英美之间所存在的深刻分裂，已再不能用什么“密切合作”可以掩盖的了。
    不列颠联邦内部的分歧与矛盾，集中地表现在所谓“防务”问题的讨论中。在这个问题上英国原图把它扩充军备的负担，更多地转嫁到各自治领的头上，要求巴基斯坦负责中东，印度负责东南亚，澳、新负责香港、马来亚的“防务”。但是，英国这一计划，遭到其自治领伙伴们的猛烈抵抗。对于讨论“防务”问题的两次会议，印、巴、锡三国一而再地拒绝参加，而参加会议的澳、新两国，亦强调它们人力、物力的困难，表示无法接替英国在香港与马来亚的“防务”。这样，原定为会议主要议题之一的“防务”问题，就以完全失败而草草了结。
    会议在日本问题上决定追随美国的政策，同意美国尽速缔结对日和约与重新武装日本的计划。然而，不列颠联邦总理会议在这个问题上的协议，不过只是一张废纸而已。如同朝鲜问题的解决一样，任何日本问题的解决，没有中华人民共和国与苏联的参加，是根本不可能的。
