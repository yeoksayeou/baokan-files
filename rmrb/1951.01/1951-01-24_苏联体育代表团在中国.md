　　The Soviet Sports Delegation in China
    Zhang Qihua
    Since arriving in China, the Soviet sports delegation has visited cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Nanjing, Guangzhou, and Wuhan, and will also visit Shenyang and Harbin. They have held fourteen symposiums and lectures with sports workers in various parts of China, where they introduced in detail the leadership and organization system of Soviet sports, the overview of Soviet sports cadre training, the Soviet basketball organization work, and basketball refereeing. From the report of Comrade Romanov, the head of the Soviet sports delegation, we understand that the reason why Soviet sports have achieved today's high achievements is due to the care and leadership of the Party and the government and the active efforts of the people. At the same time, it is also because they have established sports leading organs from the All-Soviet Central Government to the Republic, State, District and even grassroots units, all over the country. Not only do all levels of government have dedicated sports departments, but also enterprises, collective farms, institutions, and schools have mass organizations leading sports activities. These organizations have also established national leading bodies according to the production and administrative systems. This enables sports activities to not only obtain the strong leadership of the Party and the government, but also have a broad mass base.
    Comrade Spandaryan, the head coach of the Soviet sports delegation's basketball team, introduced the Soviet basketball organization work and sincerely suggested that in order to better develop China's basketball movement, a unified national leadership organization for basketball movement should be established, a unified referee committee should be established, the grading standards of basketball players should be measured, the sports rules and venue formats in various places should be unified, and attention should be paid to organizing youth sports competitions.
    They also introduced the Soviet Union's complete and well-connected sports cadre training education system. Today, the Soviet Union not only has many sports academies and sports universities to train specialized sports researchers and staff, but also has many physical education departments and specialized physical education schools in normal universities to train physical education teachers for secondary and primary schools. Correspondence departments and subjects are set up in these schools, and special training courses and advanced courses are also established to continuously improve the sports professional level of in-service cadres. These will all become good models for us to carry out sports education in the future.
    The basketball team, the main component of the Soviet sports delegation, has held 22 friendly matches with various Chinese teams in various places. With their outstanding skills, they have practically helped us and told us the correct direction of basketball. They also provided on-site guidance in various places, patiently and meticulously correcting many of our basketball training methods. At the same time, they also praised the excellent skills and moral character of Chinese players with extremely earnest spirit, and affirmed the considerable achievements of Chinese sports.
    The Soviet sports delegation is about to visit the Northeast and then return home. The great internationalist help they have given to Chinese sports workers during their visit is deeply felt by the Chinese sports community. As Comrade Romanov said, this is just the beginning of sports exchanges between the two countries. In the future, we should strengthen ties, continuously exchange experiences and opinions, so that the friendship between the sports circles of China and the Soviet Union and the people of the two countries will develop and consolidate.

　　苏联体育代表团在中国
    张其华
    苏联体育代表团来华后，访问了京、津、沪、宁、穗、汉等城市，并将前往沈、哈等地。他们和中国各地的体育工作者先后已举行了十四次座谈会和讲演会，在会中详细地介绍了关于苏联体育运动的领导组织系统、苏联体育干部训练的概况、苏联的篮球组织工作及篮球裁判等问题。从苏联体育代表团团长罗曼诺夫同志的报告中，使我们了解苏联体育之所以达到今天的高度成就，是由于党和政府的关怀和领导及人民的积极努力，同时也是由于他们曾建立了从全苏中央到共和国、州、区以至基层单位，遍及各地的体育领导机关。不但各级政府中设有这样的专管体育部门，在各企业、农庄、机关、学校中也都有着领导体育运动的群众团体组织，这些组织并按生产和行政系统成立起全国性的领导机构。这就使体育运动不但获得党和政府的有力领导，同时也具有了广泛的群众基础。
    苏联体育代表团篮球总教练斯班达里扬同志在介绍了苏联篮球组织工作后，并诚挚地建议我们，为了更好的开展中国篮球运动，应该建立全国性的篮球运动的统一领导机构，成立统一的裁判委员会，测定篮球运动员的等级标准，统一各地运动规则和场地格式及注意组织少年的运动比赛等。
    他们还介绍了苏联的体系完整、程度衔接的体育干部训练的教育制度。苏联今天不但有了许多处体育研究院、体育大学以培养体育专门研究和工作人员，有了许多处师范大学体育系和专科体育学校以训练中等和初等学校的体育师资，并在这些学校里设立函授系、科，及另外专门成立讲习班、进修班等以不断提高在职干部的体育业务水平。这些都将成为我们今后开展体育教育的良好楷模。
    苏联体育代表团的主要组成部分篮球队，在各地先后与中国各队已举行了友谊比赛二十二场，他们以其本身的卓越技术，实际地帮助我们，告诉我们以篮球运动的正确方向。在各地他们并且临场指导，循循善诱地对我们的篮球训练方法作了许多的指正。同时他们还以极恳切的精神称赞中国队员的优良技术和道德作风，肯定了中国体育运动的相当高度的成就。
    苏联体育代表团即将赴东北访问，然后返国。他们在访问中间对中国体育工作者所给予的伟大国际主义精神的帮助；这是中国体育界所盛感的。正如罗曼诺夫同志所说，这还是两国体育交流的开始，以后更应加紧连系，不断交换经验和意见，使中苏两国体育界及两国人民间的友谊益形发展和巩固。（附图片）
