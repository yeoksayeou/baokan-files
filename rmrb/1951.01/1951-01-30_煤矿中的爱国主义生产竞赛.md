　　Patriotic Production Competition in Coal Mines
    Chen Gengfu
  (I)
    The patriotic safe production competition, embodying the coal miners' strong will and practical actions to love the people's motherland, has brought an unprecedented surge in coal mining industry production. According to incomplete statistics from Northeast, North China, and East China, over 210,000 people are currently participating in the patriotic production competition. Thanks to the united cooperation of workers, staff, and technical personnel in improving technology, operational methods, and labor organization, many units have achieved significant results. The Tonghua Mining Area increased its average per-worker efficiency from 0.29 tons in October of last year to 0.403 tons in November, completing the annual production task on December 5th of last year. The Fushun Coal Mine's open-pit mine completed its annual production task ahead of schedule on November 25th of last year. In the East China Huainan Coal Mine, thanks to the unity of workers and technical personnel and the in-depth engagement of cadres in the field during the competition, technical difficulties in the new coal mining method were overcome, enabling cyclical operations and the establishment of scientific management production charts. The Jiawang Coal Mine conducted an anti-waste campaign, which began to reduce production costs. In North China, state-owned coal mines exceeded their production plan by 9.1% in November of last year, and the Yongdingzhuang Mine in the Datong Mining Area basically achieved success in reforming coal mining methods, mastering roof management, clarifying the importance of roof management and its methods, and eliminating liability accidents. In the competition, combined with the rectification and improvement of labor organization, all mining areas saved labor. The Gaode Mine in the Fuxin Coal Mine in Northeast China needed to add 180 excavating workers according to the new production task. After rectification, not only was there no need to add workers, but there was a surplus of 65 people. The general attendance rate increased from about 80% before the competition to over 90%. The number of accidents generally decreased gradually. In addition, a large number of advanced producers and model groups emerged in the production campaign. According to incomplete statistics from Northeast China, there are more than 240 advanced production groups in various coal mines.
  (II)
    This patriotic production competition campaign differs from past production competition campaigns. First, the patriotic production competition is closely linked to the current political situation. Trade union organizations at all levels have vigorously conducted extensive current affairs education, enabling workers, staff, and technical personnel to recognize the aggressive schemes of American imperialism, the friendship and common interests of the Chinese and Korean peoples, and inspiring unparalleled patriotic enthusiasm, strengthening the determination to resist America, aid Korea, protect the home and defend the country with practical actions, thereby sparking a surge in the competition and rapidly launching the campaign. Second, the patriotic production competition campaign has great breadth, unprecedented in the history of coal mines. Since the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the First Members' Representative Conference of the China Coal Mine Trade Union called on coal miners across the country to launch patriotic competitions, it is no longer a competition in one mining area, but coal mines across the country are participating in the competition, and mining areas inside and outside the customs have put forward fraternal challenges to each other. Not only workers participated, but staff, engineering and technical personnel, doctors, nurses, canteen workers, and even family members in some places were also involved in the movement. Technical personnel from the Fushun Coal Mine challenged technical personnel throughout Northeast China; technical personnel from the Mentougou Coal Mine also proposed to overcome mercenary views, go deep into the field, combine with workers, study work together, and improve technology to strive to improve efficiency and reduce costs. The master chef of the Datong Coal Mine canteen promised the workers to prepare good meals so that the workers would be healthy and produce more. Mine medical workers changed their work attitude to cure patients and strengthened health care at the mine entrance. In addition, the family members of employees in coal mines such as the Xi'an Coal Mine also made guarantees to prepare meals and boil water on time so that workers could rest well and go to work on time. Third, labor models and advanced producers are driving the movement forward. Zhang Zifu, a special-class labor model from the Fushun Coal Mine representing national labor models, challenged coal miners across the country, repeatedly conducted current affairs publicity to employees at the mine, and gave thirty-one reports, with more than 30,000 listeners. Labor model representatives Shi Yuhai, Li Qingxuan, and others returned to Northeast China from Beijing, and the production minister of the Northeast Regional Committee of the Coal Mine Trade Union went to various mining areas with them to give cyclic lectures, calling on employees to rise up to resist America, aid Korea, and launch a patriotic production competition. After returning to their jobs, they immediately set an example, leading everyone to actively produce. Ma Liuha, a labor model representative from the Datong Coal Mine, took the lead in organizing a newspaper reading group to study current affairs every day and set off a competition. Under the leadership of Nie Danzhi, the Fengfeng Coal Mine organized competitions between groups and workshops. Many other labor models are maintaining their honor with unparalleled enthusiasm, leading everyone to actively participate in the competition. Finally, trade union cadres at all levels also implemented the spirit of rectification, went deep into the field, and provided specific assistance in organizing the competition.
    For example, more than 65% of trade union cadres in various mining areas in Northeast China have gone to grassroots organizations in mines to help with their work.
  (III)
    Although this patriotic production competition campaign has achieved great results and has a wide scope, there are still serious shortcomings: (1) The combination with the safe production policy is not sufficient. Some places only focus on output, neglecting safety, and even producing "shock tactics," doing everything to increase output. Some do not strictly implement technical regulations, labor discipline is lax, and projects are not up to standard. Individual mines have seen coal being mined wherever it is found, even mining safety coal pillars. Therefore, the number of accidents has increased in some mining areas during the competition. For example, several liability accidents have occurred continuously in the Jixi and Fuxin coal mines in Northeast China. (2) The phenomenon of shock overtime is very serious. In some units, under the active and enthusiastic work of employees, there is tense shock work, overtime, and voluntary labor, generally extending working hours and reducing rest days. Some have changed from a three-shift system to a two-shift system, increasing the working time per shift to twelve hours. In order to persist in shock production, people work while sick, and even individual workers have experienced spitting blood. Not enough is being done to cherish this high level of labor enthusiasm, pay attention to labor protection in a timely manner, and provide appropriate rewards. (3) Competition plans generally suffer from the problem of being too general, with too many clauses, not thorough enough, not practical enough, and not clear enough. Some ignore improving quality and reducing costs in order to increase output. Some groups propose to guarantee the production tasks of the entire mine. Some propose a 100% attendance rate, resulting in sick workers staying in the pit instead of seeking treatment. Some leave their jobs and propose to go down the pit to dig coal. For example, all the security personnel of the Fuxin Coal Mine and the Xinqiu Mine requested to go down the pit to dig coal, ignoring how to fulfill their security responsibilities, diligently inspect, pay attention to specifications, and prevent accidents as competition goals. (4) The organization of production competition is not sufficiently combined with existing organizational forces and work. Some do not launch the competition on the basis of current work, but do something completely different. For example, some mines in Northeast China abandoned the original collective contracts and established new competition conditions. Some places organize the Resist America and Aid Korea Committee to carry out current affairs study, ignoring the use of existing employee spare-time schools and trade union cultural and educational departments' organizations and forces, and some fail to combine current affairs education with cultural education, stopping cultural learning. Some mining areas organize production competition committees to lead the production competition. On the one hand, this shows the weakness of the trade union organizational forces, and on the other hand, it ignores that organizing production competitions is one of the trade union's regular tasks. This kind of organizing temporary committees to replace or cancel the role of the trade union without strengthening and using existing organizations and leaving the existing organizational forces will also cause the competition to form a short-term shock. (5) With the development of the competition and the increase in production capacity, individual places raise quotas and lower wage rates, and some other places emphasize the country's difficulties, arbitrarily cancel welfare benefits, and do not pay attention to appropriately solving employee welfare problems, which urgently needs to be corrected.
  (IV)
    In order to consolidate achievements, correct shortcomings, and further deepen and develop the competition movement, the following suggestions for improvement are put forward: (1) The direction of the movement must be guided to the combination of labor enthusiasm and improved technology. Only by focusing on improving labor organization, organizing technical learning, improving production technology, vigorously promoting advanced experience, implementing safety regulations, and consolidating labor discipline can achievements be made and the movement consolidated and improved. It must also be combined with improved management so that current production plans and material supply, transportation, etc., are adapted to the competition movement. Second, it is necessary to consolidate and cherish the full labor enthusiasm and mobilize all personnel to participate. Further publicity and explanation should be carried out to make all employees clearly recognize that the patriotic production competition is to simultaneously achieve safe production, ensure quality, reduce accidents, and reduce costs, and to accumulate wealth for the country and enhance national defense capabilities. (2) Improve the leadership of the production competition. First of all, the production competition plan should be concise and clear, and there is no need for too many clauses. It can focus on paying attention to how much efficiency is improved, how much quality is improved, how much cost is reduced, how much attendance rate is improved, and ensuring compliance with technical regulations and eliminating liability accidents. However, it must be discussed by the masses and voluntarily set out, and should not be handled by cadres alone, and the goals set should not be too high or too low. Secondly, improve the trade union organization, especially establish and improve the production wage committee of the grassroots committee, strengthen the business work of various departments of the trade union, to organize and promote the work, but also to solve the clear division of labor between the party, government, trade union, and league, so that the pace is consistent, in order to achieve organic cooperation. (3) Focus on actively cultivating model groups and labor models, carry out rationalization proposals, and promote Shi Yuhai's and Liu Jiuxue's safe production experience. (4) The organization of the competition should focus on the pit entrance and workshop, and trade union cadres must go deep into the pit entrance to provide specific assistance. (5) Do a good job in publicity and mobilization combined with regular inspections and timely rewards and punishments. If inspections are neglected and there are no rewards, the competition will not be able to continue normally and persistently. (6) Appropriately solve employee welfare and wage issues and pay attention to improving labor conditions.

　　煤矿中的爱国主义生产竞赛
    陈耕夫
  （一）
    表现着煤矿工人热爱人民祖国的坚强意志和实际行动的爱国主义安全生产竞赛，给煤矿工业带来了前所未有的生产高涨。据东北、华北、华东三个地区不完全的统计，目前已有二十一万余人参加了爱国主义生产竞赛。由于工人、职员、技术人员的团结合作，提高技术，改进操作方法，改善劳动组织，很多单位已获得很大成绩。通化矿区由去年十月份全局每工平均效率○·二九吨，增到去年十一月的○·四○三吨，并于去年十二月五日完成全年生产任务。抚顺煤矿露天矿于去年十一月二十五日提前完成了全年的生产任务。华东淮南煤矿在竞赛中由于工人、技术人员的团结，干部的深入现场，在新式采煤法中克服了技术上的困难，开始做到循环作业，建立科学管理的生产图表制。贾汪煤矿进行反浪费斗争，使生产成本开始降低。华北国营煤矿去年十一月份生产超过计划百分之九·一，大同矿区永定庄矿改革采煤法基本上获得成功，并掌握了顶板管理，明确了顶板管理的重要性及其管理方法，消灭了责任事故。在竞赛中，结合劳动组织的整顿和改善，各矿区都节省了劳动力。东北阜新煤矿高德矿按照新的生产任务，需要增加一百八十名采掘工，经过整顿后，不仅不需要增加，还多余了六十五人。出勤率一般的已由竞赛前百分之八十左右增到百分之九十以上。事故一般的逐渐减少。此外，在生产运动中涌现了大批的先进生产者和模范小组，据东北不完全的统计，各煤矿有先进生产小组二百四十余个。
  （二）
    这次爱国主义生产竞赛运动，是与过去的生产竞赛运动有着不同的情况的。首先，爱国主义生产竞赛是与当前政治形势密切结合的。各级工会组织大力进行了广泛的时事教育，使工人、职员、技术人员认识了美帝国主义的侵略阴谋，中朝两国人民的友谊和利害关系，激发了无比的爱国热情，加强了以实际行动来抗美援朝保家卫国的决心，从而掀起了竞赛的热潮，使运动迅速开展。其次，爱国主义生产竞赛运动是具有很大的广泛性，是煤矿历史上前所未有的。自中华全国总工会和中国煤矿工会第一届会员代表大会号召全国煤矿工人展开爱国竞赛后，已不是一个矿区的竞赛，而是全国范围内的煤矿参加了竞赛，关内关外各矿区相互间提出了兄弟般的挑战。不仅工人参加了，职员、工程技术人员、医生、护士、食堂工作者，甚至有的地方连家属也都一齐卷入了运动。抚顺煤矿的技术人员向全东北技术人员挑战；门头沟煤矿的技术人员也纷纷提出克服雇佣观点，深入现场，与工人结合，在一起研究工作，改进技术，为提高效率、降低成本而奋斗。大同煤矿食堂大师傅向工人保证做好饭菜，使工人身体健康更多生产。矿山医务工作者以改变工作态度治好病人，加强井口的卫生医务工作。还有西安煤矿等矿的职工家属，也提出保证，按时作好饭，烧好水，使工人好好休息，按时上班。再次，劳动模范和先进生产者推动着运动前进。全国劳动模范代表抚顺煤矿的特等劳动模范张子富向全国煤矿工人提出挑战，在矿上一再向职工进行时事宣传，进行三十一次报告，听讲者达三万余人。劳动模范代表施玉海、李庆萱等从北京返回东北，煤矿工会东北区委员会生产部长就和他们一起到各矿区作循环讲演，号召职工起来抗美援朝，开展爱国主义生产竞赛。他们回到工作岗位以后，即以身作则，带领大家积极生产。大同煤矿劳动模范代表马六孩带头组织读报组，每天学习时事，掀起竞赛。峰峰煤矿在聂丹芝的带领下，组织组与组、车间与车间的竞赛。还有许多劳动模范都以无比的热情，保持着荣誉，带领大家积极参加竞赛。最后，各级工会干部也贯彻整风精神，深入现场，具体帮助组织竞赛。
    如东北各矿区工会百分之六十五以上的干部已分别到矿井基层组织中帮助工作。
  （三）
    这次爱国主义生产竞赛运动虽然成绩很大，范围很广，但还存在着严重的缺点：（一）与安全生产方针结合不够。有的地方只顾产量，忽视保安，甚至产生“突击主义”偏向，一切为了增加产量。有的执行技术规程不够严格，劳动纪律松懈，工程不合规格，个别矿井曾发生见煤就挖，甚至连保安炭柱也挖的现象，因此有的矿区在竞赛中事故增多了，如东北鸡西、阜新煤矿连续发生数次责任事故。（二）突击加班的现象很严重。有的单位，在职工积极热情工作之下，紧张突击，加班加点、献工，普遍延长工作时间，减少休息日，有的由每日三班制改为两班制，每班工作时间增加到十二小时。为了坚持突击生产，带病工作，甚至个别的工人，发生了吐血现象。对于如何爱护这种高度劳动热情，及时注意劳动保护，予以适当奖励，都嫌做得不够。（三）竞赛计划普遍地犯了一般化的毛病，条文多，不够周密，不够实际，不够明确。有的为了增加产量，忽视了提高质量和降低成本。有的一个小组提出保证全矿的生产任务。有的提出出勤率百分之百，以致造成了有病的工人，也在坑内呆着，不去治疗。有的离开了自己的工作岗位，却提出下井参加刨煤，如阜新煤矿、新邱矿保安股全体要求下井刨煤，而忽略了以如何担负起保安责任，勤于检查，注意规格，防止事故来作为竞赛目标。（四）组织生产竞赛与现有组织力量和工作结合不够。有的不从现在工作基础上展开竞赛，而是另搞一套。如东北某些矿井，将原有集体合同废弃，另订立竞赛条件。有的地方组织抗美援朝委员会来进行时事学习，忽略了利用现有的职工业余学校和工会文教部的组织和力量，有的未能将时事教育与文化教育结合，而停止了文化学习。有的矿区组织生产竞赛委员会来领导生产竞赛，这一方面是说明工会组织力量的薄弱，另方面也忽略了组织生产竞赛是工会的经常工作之一。这种不加强和运用现有组织而离开现有组织力量组织临时委员会来代替或取消工会的作用，也将使竞赛形成短期突击的原因。（五）随着竞赛的开展，生产能力的提高，个别地方提高定额，降低工资单价，另有一些地方强调国家困难，随便取消福利待遇，不注意适当解决职工福利问题，这是急需纠正的。
  （四）
    为了巩固成绩，改正缺点，使竞赛运动进一步深入和发展，特提出如下改进的意见：（一）运动的方向必须引向劳动热情与提高技术相结合，只有从改进劳动组织，组织技术学习，提高生产技术，大力推广先进经验，贯彻保安规程，巩固劳动纪律着眼，才能作出成绩，才能使运动巩固与提高。也必须与改善管理相结合，使目前的生产计划和材料供应、运输等与竞赛运动相适应。其次，要巩固与爱护饱满的劳动热情，动员全体人员参加。进一步宣传解释，使全体职工明确认识爱国主义生产竞赛是要同时达到在安全条件下进行生产，保证质量，减少事故和降低成本。并为国家积累财富，增强国防力量。（二）改进生产竞赛的领导。首先，生产竞赛计划要简明，条文不必多。可以着重注意提高效率多少，提高质量多少，降低成本多少，提高出勤率多少，以及保证遵守技术规程和消灭责任事故等。但必须由群众讨论，自愿订出，而不应由干部包办，所订目标也不应过高或过低。其次，健全工会组织，特别是建立和健全基层委员会的生产工资委员会，加强工会各部门的业务工作，以组织推动工作，还要解决党、政、工、团明确分工，使步调一致，以达到有机的配合。（三）有重点地积极培养模范小组和劳动模范，开展合理化建议，推广施玉海、刘九学的安全生产经验。（四）组织竞赛应以坑口、车间为重点，工会干部必须深入坑口，具体帮助。（五）作好结合着定期检查及时奖惩的宣传鼓动工作。疏于检查，没有奖励，竞赛便不能正常持久下去。（六）适当地解决职工福利和工资问题，并注意改善劳动条件。
