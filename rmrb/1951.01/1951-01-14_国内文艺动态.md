Domestic Literary and Art Activities

　　In the thirtieth issue of "Wenyi Bao" (Literary Gazette), published on January 10th, there are noteworthy criticisms of several works. These works are: Wang Yaping's poem "Angry Rocket," Hu Danfei's three-act drama "The Enemy Without Guns," Sha Ou's poem "Donkey Doctor," and Guo Jialing's poem "The American Robber Opens His Bloody Mouth." Such stern, comradely criticism is absolutely necessary for the literary and art circles. It is hoped that the efforts of Wenyi Bao will receive a proper response.
　　Mei Lanfang's "Forty Years of Stage Life" began publication in the Shanghai Wenhui Bao on October 16, 1950, and has now been serialized to seventy installments, recorded by Xu Jichuan. This is a record of historical interest, which not only records Mei's own rich stage experience, but also narrates many important historical facts about the development of Peking Opera.
　　Cheng Yanqiu began publishing his Northwest visit notes, "From Qingdao to Pamir," on December 22nd of last year. This visit was the first part of his national folk art heritage survey plan. Cheng set off at the end of April last year, spent seven months, reaching as far as Kashgar on the Pamir Plateau, and returned to Beijing at the end of November.
　　Various art groups in Beijing, under the initiation and organization of the National Artists Association, jointly held an anti-American aggression and aid-Korea, defend-the-homeland art exhibition. It was exhibited at the Laboring People's Cultural Palace for eight days, from December 31st of last year to January 7th of this year. It has now been moved to the Hall of Supreme Harmony for continued exhibition.
　　The units participating in this exhibition included the Central Academy of Fine Arts, the Tianjin Artists Association, and the Shijiazhuang Artists Association. The types of works were mostly posters, cartoons, comic strips, and also a few sculptures, oil paintings, and traditional Chinese paintings. The authors included professional artists, teachers and students from art academies and primary and secondary schools, workers, and also office cadres. Approximately 5,000 works were submitted for preliminary selection, and a total of 838 works were exhibited.
　　Among the photographs of the exhibited artworks, a portion of the precious Chinese cultural relics plundered by American imperialism through the Qing government and the traitorous Chiang Kai-shek government (see illustrations in this issue) particularly attracted the attention of the audience.
　　Comrades from the Central Academy of Drama, the People's Art Theatre, and other eight literary and art groups in Beijing, in the anti-American aggression and aid-Korea movement, formed eight propaganda teams to carry out propaganda work in the urban suburbs. Starting from November 21st of last year, they performed dramas, living newspapers, dances, cross-talk, etc., a total of eighty-eight times in twenty-six days. 938 comrades participated in the performance, and the audience reached 142,000 people.
　　In order to review anti-American aggression and aid-Korea literary and artistic works, the Art Committee of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression, the National Federation of Literary and Art Circles' Anti-American Aggression and Aid-Korea Propaganda Committee, and the Beijing Federation of Literary and Art Circles jointly held a performance observation evening on December 23rd and 24th of last year. The program was mainly drama, and all were creations by professional literary and art groups, workers, and students themselves. Among the thirteen performance programs, the most popular were Li Chuanxiu, a student from the Normal University, with the "Anti-American Aggression and Aid-Korea Clapper Talk," the China University Cultural Troupe's single-string "Four Guns," the drum song "Fisherman's Hatred," and the Central Academy of Drama's drama "Mother's Heart."

　　国内文艺动态
    在一月十日出版的第三十期“文艺报”中，刊登了对几篇作品的可注意的批评。这些作品是：王亚平的诗“愤怒的火箭”、胡丹沸的三幕话剧“不拿枪的敌人”、沙鸥的诗“驴大夫”、郭嘉陵的诗“美国强盗张大了血嘴”。这种严正的同志式的批评对文艺界是完全需要的。希望文艺报的努力能够得到正当的反应。
    梅兰芳的“舞台生活四十年”自一九五○年十月十六日在上海文汇报开始发表，现已连载到七十篇，纪录者为许姬传。这是一个有历史兴味的记载，它不但纪录了梅氏自己丰富的舞台经验，而且叙述了皮簧戏发展的许多重要史实。
    程砚秋在去年十二月二十二日开始发表了他的西北访问记“从青岛到帕米尔”。这次访问是他的全国民间艺术遗产调查计划中的第一个部分。程氏于去年四月底出发，经过七个月的时间，最远到达帕米尔高原的喀什噶尔，于十一月底回到北京。
    北京市美术界各团体在全国美协的发动与组织之下，联合举办了一次抗美援朝保家卫国美术展览会。从去年十二月三十一日到今年一月七日在劳动人民文化宫共展览了八天。现移至太和殿继续展览中。
    参加这个展览会的单位包括中央美术学院、天津美协和石家庄美协等。作品种类大部分是招贴画、漫画、连环画、也有少数雕塑、油画和国画。作者有专业的美术工作者，有美术学院及中小学校的教师和同学，有工人、也有机关干部。参加初选的作品约计五千件，展出的作品共八百三十八件。
    展览的艺术品照片中，包括一部分美国帝国主义通过满清政府、蒋介石卖国政府掠夺去的我国的珍贵文物（参看本期插图）特别引起观众的注意。
    北京市中央戏剧学院、人民艺术剧院等八个文艺团体的同志们，在抗美援朝运动中，曾经组成八个宣传大队在城市郊区进行宣传工作。从去年十一月二十一日开始，二十六天当中，演出话剧、活报剧、舞蹈、相声等共八十八场。参加演出工作的同志有九百三十八人，观众达十四万两千人。
    北京市文艺界为了检阅抗美援朝文艺作品，在去年十二月二十三、四两天，由中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会艺术委员会、全国文联抗美援朝宣传委员会和北京市文联三单位联合举办了观摩演出晚会。节目以戏剧为主，都是专业文艺团体、工人和学生自己的创作。在十三个演出节目中，最受欢迎的有师大同学李传琇的“抗美援朝快板”、华大文工团的单弦“四支枪”、大鼓“渔夫恨”、中央戏剧学院的话剧“母亲的心”。
