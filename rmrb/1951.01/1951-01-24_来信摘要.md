　　Letter Excerpts

    Shi Yuping, Teacher at Qinyang County Provincial Middle School Attached Elementary School writes:

    Raising the Flag and Singing the National Anthem Should Be Solemn and Respectful

    In Qinyang County, many people do not show sufficient solemnity and respect when raising the flag and singing the national anthem at various gatherings. For example, at the celebration of New Year's Day 1951 in our county, including responsible comrades from the county government and various departments, teachers and students from various schools, and government cadres, all appeared inattentive and insufficiently solemn when the flag was raised and the national anthem was sung. The national flag and national anthem represent the dignity of the People's Republic of China, and we should cherish our great motherland with utmost solemnity and respect.

    Xu Shuli and Zheng Jianhua from Beijing Industrial School write:

    Suggesting a Ban on the Casual Production of Commemorative Badges of Leaders

    Everywhere in the streets and bookstores, one can buy commemorative badges of our beloved leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, and the leader of the world's people, Marshal Stalin. Some are exquisitely made, while others are very crudely made. Some people buy commemorative badges as decorations and lose them casually. We suggest that the behavior of casually producing and selling commemorative badges that disrespect the leaders should be banned, and a unified style should be prescribed. (Editor's note: This suggestion is very good. We hope that relevant authorities will consider the handling method.)

    Zhang Yanhua from the Logistics and Transportation Department of the North China Artillery writes:

    Suggesting Thorough Erasure of Reactionary Slogans

    We frequently travel to and from Andingmen. We see that in the lower-left corner of the north side of the arrow tower of the gate, there are still reactionary slogans that have not been erased. This affects the dignity of the capital.

    (Editor's note: This opinion is very good and should be taken seriously by relevant departments in various regions. We hope for a general inspection and thorough erasure of remaining reactionary slogans and calls in various places.)

    Wan Peizhi from Beijing Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative writes:

    The Government Should Regularly Inspect and Repair Roads

    The roads at the south entrance of Baimiao Hutong in the old Ministry of Justice Street of this city were just repaired last November, and now they are already dilapidated again. On January 16th, when I walked there, two pedicab drivers were discussing this matter, meaning that the repairs last year were not careful enough. I suggest that the relevant authorities should inspect and repair the roads as soon as possible to avoid the expansion of the damage over time, which would further waste state property; at the same time, it would also be beneficial to maintaining the cleanliness of traffic.

    (Editor's note: Comrade Wan Peizhi's spirit of caring about municipal construction and actively making suggestions is very good. We hope that the Beijing Municipal Construction Bureau can regularly check the road conditions and repair them in a timely manner; in particular, the quality of the project should be strictly checked.)

     Wang Shijun from the Tong County Party Committee Propaganda Department writes:

    Radio Propaganda is Very Popular with the Masses

    In order to strengthen propaganda work, wired radio broadcasting has been installed in various streets and trading markets in Tong County since New Year's Day this year. Residents and visiting farmers and merchants from various places can listen to the broadcast while conducting transactions. This form of propaganda is very popular with the masses. In addition to rebroadcasting current affairs news and commentaries from the Central Station and news from our province from Baoding Radio Station, "Voice of Tong County" has also been added to broadcast the central work and major news of various agencies and groups of the county government. For example, after the Market Management Committee broadcast the "Rules for Managing Merchants and Vendors," the vendors all operated according to the designated locations and methods, which improved the market order.

    (Editor's note: According to the experience of Tong County, radio propaganda is not only welcomed by the masses but can also promote work. We hope that local county and district governments, where possible, will find ways to install radios.)

    Zhao Zongfan and Gao Dianying from Jilin Railway Bureau write:

    Zhang Wanshun Promoted to Chief-Level Switchman

    Zhang Wanshun, the national switching banner of Meihekou Station of the Jilin Railway Bureau, was promoted to chief-level switchman on the 13th of this month and received a 14th-grade salary. This is the glory of railway workers across the country.

    Zhang Wanshun was awarded the glorious title of First-Class Labor Model at the "May Day" Labor Day conference last year. After the start of the movement to Resist America, Aid Korea, and Defend the Home and Defend the Country, he brought into play the working class's high patriotic enthusiasm and unparalleled wisdom, leading all groups in the station to actively work and complete arduous national defense military transportation tasks. He received a special award from the Jilin Railway Bureau. By January 13th, their switching team had gloriously reached one thousand one hundred and seven days without a responsible accident.

    Zhang Lihu from Baichengzi Engineering Section writes:

    Workers Launch Savings and Thrift Movement

    All members of the trade union of Baichengzi Engineering Section have launched a savings and thrift movement in the movement to Resist America, Aid Korea, and Defend the Home and Defend the Country. Under the call of union chairman Li Zibin and section chief Shi Fenggang, in just three or four days, the entire section purchased more than one hundred and forty term lottery savings (each worth 100,000 Northeast currency), and the number of people saving accounted for 75% of all personnel. The savings and thrift movement is still continuing to develop.

    Zhang Chunhe from Qinhuangdao Supply and Marketing Cooperative writes:

    Mobile Delivery Solves Members' Purchase Difficulties

    The Qinhuangdao First District Citizen Cooperative tried a mobile delivery method on the 17th of this month, which solved the difficulty of members' purchases and was well-received. The cooperative members live scattered, and the members of Xiaodongzhuang and other villages are more than two li away from the cooperative address, making purchasing quite inconvenient. Setting up another stall would be limited by funds. After a resolution by the members' representative conference, the mobile delivery method was adopted. The method is: set up a mobile delivery team, the car (two-wheeled handcart) carrying rice, corn flour, cooking oil, matches and other more than ten kinds of daily necessities, every time it arrives in a alley, it will ring a copper bell as a signal. In the first day's six hours, more than 400,000 yuan worth of goods were sold, and eleven citizens requested to join the cooperative.

专栏：来信摘要

　　来信摘要
    沁阳县省中附小教员石玉屏来信：
    升旗和唱国歌时应严肃恭敬
    在沁阳县各种大会上升旗和唱国歌的时候，很多人表现的不够严肃和恭敬。如我县庆祝一九五一年元旦日的大会上，包括县府及各部门负责同志、各学校师生及机关干部，当升旗和唱国歌时，都表现得满不在意，不够严肃。国旗和国歌是代表中华人民共和国的尊严，我们应该以无限的严肃和敬意，来热爱我们伟大的祖国。
    北京工业学校许树礼、郑健华来信：
    建议禁止随便制造领袖纪念章
    在街头、书店中，到处可以买到我们所热爱的中国人民领袖毛主席及世界人民领袖斯大林大元帅的纪念章，有的制得很精致，有的却制得非常草率；有些人买纪念章当做装饰品，并且随便丢失。我们建议：对于随便制造和售卖不尊敬领袖的纪念章的行为应加取缔，并规定统一的样式。（编者按：这个建议很好。希望有关机关考虑处理办法。）
    华北炮兵后勤运输处张衍华来信：
    建议彻底涂擦反动标语
    我们经常往来安定门。看见该门箭楼座北方面的左下角，至今仍有反动标语尚未擦去。影响了首都的尊严。
    （编者按：这个意见很好，应引起各地有关部门的重视。希望普遍检查，并彻底涂擦各地残存的反动标语和口号。）
    京市供销合作总社万佩之来信：
    政府应经常检查并补修马路
    本市旧刑部街白庙胡同南口左右马路，去年十一月间刚刚修好，现在就又破烂不堪了。一月十六日，我走到那里，有两位三轮车夫正在谈论这事，意思是说去年修的太不仔细了。我建议有关机关应早日检查补修，以免日久破坏面扩大，愈加浪费国家财产；同时，对保持交通整洁也有好处。
    （编者按：万佩之同志关心市政建设，积极提出建议的精神很好。希京市建设局能经常检查马路情况，及时予以补修；特别应严格检查工程质量。）
     通县县委宣传部王实君来信：
    广播宣传很受群众欢迎
    为了加强宣传工作，通县城内自今年元旦起，在各街道和交易市场普遍按装了有线电广播。居民和来往农民及各地行商，一面进行交易，一面可以听到广播。这种宣传形式很受群众欢迎。广播内容，除转播中央台的时事新闻、评论，和保定电台的本省新闻外，并增加了“通县之声”，广播县府各机关、团体各项中心工作及重大消息。如市场管理委员会把“管理行商小贩规则”广播后，小贩都按照指定地点和办法去经营，使市场秩序好起来。
    （编者按：根据通县经验证明，广播宣传既为群众所欢迎，且能推进工作。希望各地县区政府，在可能的条件下，设法按装广播机。）
    吉林铁路局赵宗藩、高殿英来信：
    张万顺荣升主任级调车员
    吉林铁路局梅河口车站、全国调车旗帜张万顺，于本月十三日被提升为主任级调车员，领取十四级薪俸。这是全国铁路工人的光荣。
    张万顺在去年“五一”劳动节大会上荣膺一等劳动模范的光荣称号。在抗美援朝保家卫国运动开始后，他发挥工人阶级的高度爱国热情和无比的智慧，带动全站各小组积极工作，完成繁重的国防军事运输任务。获得吉林铁路局的特等奖励。到一月十三日止，他们的调车组已光荣地达到一千一百零七天未出责任事故。
    白城子工务段张立祜来信：
    工友展开节约储蓄运动
    白城子工务段工会全体会员，在抗美援朝保家卫国运动中，展开节约储蓄运动。在工会主席李子斌，和段长史凤纲的号召下，只三、四天的功夫，全段共购买定期有奖储蓄一百四十来份（每份东北币十万元），储蓄的人占全体人员百分之七十五。现在节约储蓄运动仍在继续发展。
    秦皇岛供销合作总社张春和来信：
    游动送货解决社员购买困难
    秦皇岛一区市民合作社，于本月十七日试行游动送货办法，解决了社员购买的困难，很受拥护。该社社员居住分散，小东庄等村社员距社址有二里多地，购买颇感不便。如另设一摊，又因资金有限。经社员代表大会决议，采用游动送货办法。办法是：设游动送货组，车上（双轮手推车）拉着大米、玉面、花油、火柴等十几种生活必需品，每到一胡同内，便以摇铜铃为号。在第一天的六个小时里，就卖了四十余万元的货，并有十一名市民要求入社。
