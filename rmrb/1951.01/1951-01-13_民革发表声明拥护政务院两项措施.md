Xinhua News Agency, 12th: The Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang recently issued a statement regarding its support for the Government Administration Council's two decisions to thoroughly eliminate the economic and cultural aggression of American imperialism. The full text is as follows:

　　Recently, due to the disastrous defeat in the war of aggression against Korea, and the increasingly acute contradictions within the imperialist bloc and American imperialism itself, American imperialism has arrogantly announced the control of public and private property of the People's Republic of China in the United States, nakedly exposing its shameless act of plundering the property of the Chinese people. At the same time, it attempts to threaten the livelihood of personnel in all schools, hospitals, and other institutions receiving American subsidies by suspending subsidies, which further exposes the hideous face of American imperialist cultural aggression. The Government Administration Council of our Central People's Government promulgated on December 28, 1950, the order on controlling American property in China and freezing American public and private deposits in China. On December 29th, the 65th meeting of the Government Administration Council also adopted the "Decision on Handling Cultural and Educational, Relief Organizations, and Religious Groups Receiving American Subsidies." The above two solemn and reasonable measures of our government represent the will of the entire Chinese people and are a powerful counterattack against American imperialism's economic and cultural aggression against us for more than a century. Our party solemnly expresses its wholehearted support and is willing to assist the government in implementing them. We call on all party members and the people of the whole country to, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, wage a resolute struggle to thoroughly eliminate the economic and cultural aggression of American imperialism in China.

　　民革发表声明拥护政务院两项措施
    【新华社十二日讯】中国国民党革命委员会顷发表关于拥护政务院两项决定彻底肃清美帝国主义经济和文化侵略势力的声明。全文如下：
    美帝国主义近来由于侵朝战事的惨败，以及帝国主义集团和美帝国主义本身内部的矛盾日趋尖锐，竟狂妄地宣布管制我中华人民共和国在美国辖区内的公私财产，赤裸裸地暴露其掠夺中国人民财产的无耻行为；同时又妄图以停发补助费的办法来威胁所有接受美国津贴的学校、医院等机关中的人员生活，这更暴露了美帝国主义文化侵略的狰狞面目。我中央人民政府政务院于一九五○年十二月二十八日颁布关于管制美国在中国的财产和冻结美国在中国的公私存款的命令，同月二十九日第六十五次政务会议又通过了“关于处理接受美国津贴的文化教育、救济机关及宗教团体的方针的决定”。我政府以上两项严正的合理的措施，是代表了全中国人民的意志，是对美帝国主义百余年来对我经济侵略和文化侵略的一个有力的回击。本党特郑重表示竭诚拥护，愿协助政府贯彻执行，并号召全体党员和全国人民一起在毛主席和共产党领导之下，为彻底肃清美帝国主义在华的经济侵略和文化侵略势力而作坚决的奋斗。
