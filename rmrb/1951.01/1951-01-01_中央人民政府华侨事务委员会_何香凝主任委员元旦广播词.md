Central People's Government Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission
New Year's Broadcast by Director He Xiangning

Dear Overseas Chinese Compatriots:

The second victorious New Year since the founding of the People's Republic of China has arrived. I extend to you my warmest congratulations.

The great year of 1950 was a year of continued victory for the Chinese people. Militarily, we cleared out the remaining Kuomintang reactionary troops in the Great Southwest; liberated Hainan Island, the Zhoushan Islands, and other coastal islands; and have begun our advance into Tibet. Politically: The people's democratic regime is even more consolidated; land reform is being carried out in an orderly, planned, and step-by-step manner with the enthusiastic support of the people nationwide; and a large number of bandit forces and counter-revolutionaries have been annihilated or arrested by our heroic public security forces. Economically: Last year's national harvest was abundant, and grain production is now self-sufficient, with cotton production approaching self-sufficiency. Due to the correct implementation of unified financial and economic work, the country's financial revenue and expenditure have approached balance, fundamentally ending the continuous currency inflation of the past dozen years, stabilizing prices nationwide; and transforming the original semi-colonial foreign trade into protected trade. The abnormal phenomenon of import surpluses and foreign exchange liabilities for the past century has also been completely reversed since 1950. In addition, there have been great improvements and developments in culture, education, health, and municipal administration in various places, which I will not elaborate on here.

Dear Overseas Chinese Compatriots: With the motherland thriving and developing victoriously, the hometowns of overseas Chinese compatriots have also gained unprecedented peace and great progress. The broad masses of overseas Chinese dependents in Fujian, Guangdong, and other places, under the leadership of the local people's governments, are organizing themselves and beginning to participate in the motherland's production and construction and all other struggles. They are now beginning to live a stable life. Regarding overseas remittances: Before March of last year, original currency remittances were organized, and original currency deposit certificates were issued, effectively guaranteeing the value of overseas remittances and protecting the interests of overseas Chinese dependents, which was welcomed by overseas Chinese dependents. After March, due to the unification of the motherland's finance and economy, the stabilization of prices, and the overall improvement of the national financial economy, overseas remittances also stabilized. In order to protect the interests of overseas Chinese dependents, both original and local currencies are used simultaneously, which the overseas Chinese dependents have expressed satisfaction with. In addition, the People's Government has taken various measures to simplify overseas remittance procedures, strengthen the supply of materials in overseas Chinese areas, provide welfare loans to overseas Chinese dependents, and increase the number of overseas remittance payment agencies; it has also stipulated that all handling fees for overseas remittances shall be borne by the People's Government and shall not be deducted from the remittances; this not only reduces the burden on overseas Chinese compatriots, but also protects the legitimate profits of the overseas remittance agencies. We hope that the domestic and foreign overseas remittance agencies will better serve overseas Chinese compatriots and dependents in the future, and will further unite around the Central People's Government of the motherland. In terms of customs: We have simplified inspection procedures, rectified the order of the wharves, and relaxed the duty-free allowance for items carried by overseas Chinese compatriots when returning to the country. Regarding land reform, we are also studying reasonable plans to take care of the property of overseas Chinese compatriots in their hometowns. The returned overseas Chinese students, under the cultivation and education of the motherland, are working hard to learn various technologies, actively transform themselves, and gradually establish a revolutionary outlook on life of serving the people. In short, all the measures of the People's Government of the motherland are aimed at better serving the overseas Chinese compatriots and dependents, and serving them wholeheartedly. This is worthy of consolation to our dear overseas Chinese compatriots.

Dear Overseas Chinese Compatriots: The brilliant and tremendous victories achieved by the Central People's Government of the motherland in 1950 were achieved through the united efforts of all political parties, people's organizations, and the people of the whole country under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao. The victory of 1950 proved that the powerful people of the motherland not only have the strength to overthrow the rule of the U.S. imperialists and their puppet Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries on the Chinese mainland; but also have the strength to defend the fruits of our people's victory and create a bright future for our people.

Compatriots: The U.S. imperialists are not reconciled to the happiness and victory achieved by the people of the motherland. They are not only determined to be enemies of the Chinese people, but have already begun to invade our new People's China.

The imperialist aggressor group headed by U.S. imperialism, plotting to follow the old path of Japanese imperialism, launched a war of aggression against Korea in late June 1950, attempting to destroy Korea and extend the flames of aggression to our Northeast, bombing our Northeast border dozens of times, causing dozens of deaths and injuries. It also occupied our territory of Taiwan, and further actively interfered in the national liberation movements in Vietnam, the Philippines, and other places.

This insane act of aggression by U.S. imperialism has been met with unanimous and fierce opposition from the people of the world. The people of the motherland cannot tolerate the imperialists'肆行aggression against our neighboring country of Korea and the extension of the flames of war to our national borders. The people of the motherland have voluntarily launched a vigorous movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend our country. The Korean People's Army and our People's Volunteer Army are fighting shoulder to shoulder on the south bank of the Yalu River, resisting the barbaric invading army of U.S. imperialism and achieving brilliant victories. The victory on the Korean battlefield not only boosted the confidence of the people of Asia and the world in resisting imperialist enslavement and aggression, but also eloquently proved that U.S. imperialism is a paper tiger that looks strong but is actually weak and can be completely defeated. The Chinese and Korean people fighting for justice are powerful and invincible and can never be defeated.

Although U.S. imperialism has suffered a decisive defeat in Korea, it has not accepted the lesson it deserves, nor has it changed its plan of aggression in the slightest. It not only does not withdraw its aggressive armed forces from Taiwan and Korea, but is also actively preparing for a new war. However, the liberated Chinese people have full confidence and strength to smash any provocation by the imperialists.

Compatriots: The people of the motherland love peace. We firmly advocate that the United States and other foreign troops should be withdrawn from Korea, and that Korean internal affairs should be resolved by the Korean people themselves. This is the only way to peacefully resolve the Korean issue. We insist that the U.S. armed forces invading Taiwan must be completely withdrawn; and that our country obtains its due legitimate status in the United Nations. We believe that only when U.S. imperialism truly stops all its acts of aggression can the peace and security of China and Asia be guaranteed.

Compatriots: The intensified exploitation and attack of the imperialists on the people of colonies and semi-colonies is part of its entire policy of aggression against the world. Under the boundless policy of expansion and war of the U.S. imperialists, the situation of our overseas Chinese compatriots will inevitably become increasingly difficult. In recent years, the imperialists' inhumane arrests, detentions, massacres, and large-scale expulsions of our overseas Chinese compatriots have aroused great anger and hatred among the local people and the people of the motherland. The Central People's Government of the motherland has also repeatedly lodged solemn protests and warnings to the imperialists. In particular, the British imperialist authorities in Malaya have recently committed unprecedented illegal crimes of persecuting and expelling overseas Chinese. This fascist bloody atrocity not only thoroughly exposed its extremely cruel and ferocious face, but also made us clearly realize that: In order to strive for survival and protect their legitimate rights and interests, our overseas Chinese compatriots must further strengthen unity and form a broad and strong united front including patriotic overseas Chinese from all walks of life; must resolutely oppose all acts of persecution by the imperialists, must rely on their own self-reliance to strive for survival, and the powerful people of the motherland will resolutely support all your just demands.

Dear Overseas Chinese Compatriots: The new year of 1951 will surely be a year of even greater victory for the people of the world and the people of the motherland. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, the people of the motherland will further strengthen unity, bravely advance, and strive for even greater and more glorious new victories in the sacred movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend our country. We must strengthen national defense construction, accelerate the work of land reform, consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, continue to stabilize finance and economy, and further strengthen close unity with the people of the world. This year's victory will surely be greater and more glorious than last year's victory. We will forever go from victory to victory. I wish the overseas Chinese compatriots a healthy and progressive New Year.

　　中央人民政府华侨事务委员会
    何香凝主任委员元旦广播词亲爱的侨胞们：
    中华人民共和国成立后第二个胜利的新年已经到来了，我谨向你们致热烈的祝贺。
    伟大的一九五○年是中国人民继续胜利的一年。我们在军事上扫清了大西南残余的国民党反动军队；解放了海南岛、舟山群岛及其他沿海岛屿，并已开始进军西藏。在政治方面：人民民主政权是更加巩固了；土地改革在全国人民的热烈拥护和支持下正在有秩序有计划有步骤地进行；大批土匪武装和反革命分子已被我英勇的公安部队所剿灭或逮捕。在经济方面：去年全国丰收，粮食的产量已可自给自足，棉花的产量已接近自给。由于正确执行统一财政经济工作的结果，已经使国家的财政收支接近平衡，基本上结束了过去十几年来通货不断膨胀的现象，使全国物价趋于稳定；并使原来的半殖民地性质的对外贸易，转变为保护贸易；百年来入超与外汇负债的反常现象也从一九五○年起完全改变了。在外交方面：我国已先后和十七个国家建立了正式外交关系；并在平等互利的基础上和人民民主国家签订了若干经济协定；特别是在一九五○年二月间所签订的“中苏友好同盟互助条约”，使中苏两大国七万万人民结成了亲密的坚固的同盟，大大增强了世界和平的力量。此外，在文化、教育、卫生及各地市政等方面也有很大的改进和发展，我在这里不一一细说了。
    亲爱的侨胞们：在祖国欣欣向荣，胜利发展的情况下，侨胞们的家乡也获得了前所未有的安宁和很大的进步。福建和广东等地的广大侨眷，在当地人民政府的领导之下，正在组织起来，开始参加祖国的生产建设及其他一切斗争。他们现在开始过着安定的生活了。关于侨汇方面：在去年三月以前，曾经举办原币汇款，发行原币存单，有效地保障了侨汇的币值，使侨眷的利益不受损失，曾得到侨眷的欢迎。到三月以后，由于祖国的财政经济已经统一，物价已经趋于稳定，全国财政经济开始好转。侨汇跟着稳定，为了保障侨眷的利益，原币和本币同时并用，侨眷们都表示满意。此外，人民政府又采取各种措施，简化了侨汇手续，加强侨区的物资供应，举办侨眷的福利贷款，增设兑付侨汇机构；又规定侨汇的手续费全部由人民政府来承担，一律不得在汇款内扣取；这样，一方面减轻了侨胞的负担，另一方面也保障了侨批局的合法利润。我们希望国内外的侨批局今后更好地为侨胞侨眷服务，要更进一步团结在祖国中央人民政府的周围。在海关方面：我们已经简化了检查手续，整顿了码头的秩序，放宽了侨胞们归国时所携带的物品的免税额。在有关土地改革方面，我们也正在研究合理的方案，照顾到侨胞在家乡的房产。归国的华侨学生们：在祖国的栽培与教育之下，正在努力学习各种技术，积极改造自己，逐步树立起为人民服务的革命人生观。总之，祖国人民政府的一切措施，其目的无非是要更好地为侨胞侨眷们服务，全心全意地为侨胞侨眷们服务。这是值得告慰于亲爱的海外侨胞的。
    亲爱的侨胞们：祖国中央人民政府在一九五○年所获得的辉煌巨大的胜利，是全国各党派，各人民团体和全国人民在毛主席的英明领导之下，齐心团结，一致努力得来的。一九五○年的胜利，证明了强大的祖国人民不但有力量推翻美帝国主义及其傀儡蒋介石反动派在中国大陆上的统治；并且有力量保卫我国人民的胜利果实和创造我国人民的光辉灿烂的前程。
    侨胞们：祖国人民所取得的幸福和胜利，美帝国主义是死不甘心的，它不但决心要和中国人民为敌，并且已经在侵略我们的人民新中国了。
    以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义侵略集团，阴谋走日本帝国主义的老路，在一九五○年六月下旬发动了侵略朝鲜的战争，妄图灭亡朝鲜，把侵略战火，烧向我国东北，曾轰炸我国东北边境数十次，死伤数十人。又占了我国的领土台湾，并进一步积极干涉越南、菲律宾等地的民族解放运动。
    美帝国主义这种疯狂的侵略暴行，遭到了全世界人民一致猛烈的反对。祖国人民不能容忍帝国主义者肆行侵略我们的邻邦朝鲜，并将战火烧向我国的国境。祖国人民已经志愿地展开了轰轰烈烈的抗美援朝保家卫国运动。朝鲜人民军和我们的人民志愿部队在鸭绿江南岸并肩作战，阻击美帝的野蛮侵略军而得到辉煌的胜利了。在朝鲜战场上的胜利，不但鼓舞了全亚洲全世界人民反抗帝国主义奴役和侵略的胜利信心，而且雄辩地证明了美帝国主义是一只外强中干的纸老虎，是完全可以打败的。为正义而战的中朝人民是强大无敌的，是绝对不可被战胜的。
    美帝国主义虽然在朝鲜遭到了决定性的失败，但它丝毫也没有接受应得的教训，丝毫也没有改变它的侵略计划，它不但不从台湾、朝鲜撤回其侵略武装力量，并且在积极准备新的战争。但是，解放了的中国人民是有充分的信心和力量能够粉碎帝国主义者的任何挑衅的。
    侨胞们：祖国人民是热爱和平的。我们坚决主张美国及其他外国军队一律撤出朝鲜，朝鲜内政由朝鲜人民自己解决，这是和平解决朝鲜问题的唯一道路。我们坚持美国侵略台湾的武装力量必须全部撤出；并使我国在联合国获得应有的合法地位。我们认为只有美帝国主义真正停止其一切侵略行为，中国和亚洲的和平与安全才能得到保障。
    侨胞们：帝国主义者对殖民地、半殖民地人民的加紧压榨和进攻，这是它整个侵略世界政策的一部分，在美帝国主义者毫无止境的扩张政策和战争政策之下，我海外侨胞的处境，必然日益困难。帝国主义者近年来对我们侨胞肆行惨无人道的逮捕，拘禁，屠杀和大规模的驱逐，已经引起当地人民和祖国人民极大的愤怒和仇恨，祖国中央人民政府也一再向帝国主义者提出严正的抗议和警告。特别是最近马来亚英帝国主义当局迫害驱逐华侨的非法罪行，更是史无前例的。帝国主义者这种法西斯血腥暴行，不但彻底暴露了它的极端凶残的狰狞面目，并且使我们清楚地认识到：为了争取生存和保卫自己的正当权益，我海外侨胞必须更加加强团结，结成一条广泛的强固的包括各界爱国侨胞在内的统一战线；必须坚决反对帝国主义者的一切迫害罪行，必须依靠自己的自力更生的力量来争取生存才有出路，强大的祖国人民决以全力支援你们的一切正义要求。
    亲爱的侨胞们：新的一九五一年必然是世界人民祖国人民获得更伟大胜利的一年，祖国人民在毛主席和共产党的领导之下，更加强团结一致，勇敢前进，更要在抗美援朝保家卫国的神圣运动中争取更伟大更光辉的新胜利。我们要加强国防建设，加紧进行土地改革工作，巩固人民民主专政，继续稳定财政经济，更加强与全世界人民的紧密团结。今年的胜利一定是比去年的胜利更巨大更光辉。我们将永远从胜利走向胜利。祝侨胞们新年健康和进步。
