The first plenary meeting of the committee was held on the 18th of this month. The committee is responsible for leading the work of property reassessment and review of private enterprises in Beijing, publicizing the significance and methods of property reassessment, promoting and guiding industrial and commercial households to truthfully assess the quantity and value of various properties, deliberating and determining valuation standards for various industries, approving the price lists agreed upon by the same industry, and accepting industrial and commercial households' opinions on the assessment for reconsideration.

　　The committee has a total of seventeen members, including four government representatives, one representative from the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and twelve representatives from private industry and commerce.
