　　Hebei Shulu Solves Cotton Purchase and Sales Problems
　　In 1950, the total cotton planting area in Shulu County was 349,503 mu. With an average yield of 120 jin of seed cotton per mu, the total output was 41.94 million jin. As of December 25, the Flower and Yarn Cloth Company had purchased 13.21 million jin of seed cotton, 6.54 million jin of public grain and land grain converted into cotton, 1.22 million jin purchased by outside and local merchants, 770,000 jin purchased by the supply and marketing cooperative, and 3.31 million jin retained by farmers (calculated at 9 jin per person for the entire county population). Currently, there are still 16.87 million jin of seed cotton, accounting for 40.2 percent of the total annual output. In order to purchase this batch of cotton, to ensure the smooth progress of next year's production, and to help farmers have a good Spring Festival this year, under the close cooperation of various government professional companies, it has been decided to continue purchasing through chain business, and to adopt the following four methods:

　　1. Cash Purchase: To make it convenient for cotton farmers to sell cotton, in addition to directly going to various township fairs to purchase with cash, the supply and marketing cooperatives, cotton exchanges, and private merchant cotton factories are entrusted to purchase at unified grade prices. This way, cotton can be sold at the listed price in both large and small markets.

　　2. Purchase on Credit: If cotton farmers do not need cash at the time, and cannot determine what to buy after selling cotton, they can give the cotton to the Flower and Yarn Cloth Company on credit. This not only avoids accidental losses from self-storage and occupying houses, but the company also provides the following three benefits: (1) Guarantee of Principal and Value: That is, the cotton given to the company on credit by cotton farmers is graded according to the current listed price. If the cotton price falls when the payment is due, the original price will still be paid in cash. If the cotton price rises, the price will be paid according to the original grade and the price increase; (2) Interest: An interest rate of 1% is given for a credit period of one month, 2.5% for two months, 4% for three months, and 6% for four months (no further increase for longer periods). The length of the period is determined by the cotton farmers themselves; (3) For all cotton given to the company on credit, other existing goods of state-owned professional companies (such as grain, coal, salt, department stores, etc.) can be purchased first when the payment is due.

　　3. Exchange Purchase: If cotton farmers want to exchange cotton for other materials, they can deliver the cotton to the Yarn and Cloth Company (or its agency). The Flower and Yarn Cloth Company will issue procedures for equivalent exchange based on the current commodity prices of various professional companies.

　　4. Future Sale: To avoid the cotton farmers having to take care of the cotton, and to ensure that cotton farmers receive certain materials at a certain time, the future sale method is implemented. That is, the cotton farmers hand over the cotton to the company, state the goods they want, and specify the specifications and time limit. The professional company that operates the commodity will issue formal procedures (both parties calculate according to the current listed price), and guarantee delivery of the physical goods at the time.

　　According to the above four cotton purchase methods, whether it is purchase on credit, exchange purchase, or future sale, as long as the transaction is with the Flower and Yarn Cloth Company (or its agent), it can be realized with the guarantee of both the government and the company.

　　Since the implementation of these cotton purchase methods, the government, organizations, and schools have carried out extensive publicity through various meetings, which has been supported by the broad masses of farmers. An old cotton farmer in the city said: "More than a month ago, I came with cotton on my back, but it was not easy to sell. The public said that it was to stabilize prices and temporarily slow down the purchase. If you don't need money, you can put it away first, and we will definitely find a way to not let you suffer. I didn't believe it at the time, but now the public has indeed come up with many convenient ways. Next year, I will definitely grow more cotton."

　　棉农欢迎赊购换购
    河北束鹿解决棉花购销问题
    束鹿全县一九五○年植棉为三四九、五○三亩，每亩平均产籽棉按一二○市斤计，总产量为四、一九四万斤。截至十二月二十五日止，花纱布公司已收购籽棉一、三二一万斤，公粮地粮折征棉六五四万斤，外来和本地商人买走一二二万斤，供销社收购七七万斤，农民留用按全县人口以每人九斤计算，为三三一万斤，目前尚存籽棉一、六八七万斤，占全年总产量的百分之四十点二。为了收购这批棉花，以保证明年生产的顺利进行和帮助农民过好今年的春节，在政府各专业公司紧密的配合下，决定继续以连环业务收购外，并采用以下四种办法：
    一、现购：为使棉农售棉方便，除直接分赴各乡镇集市以现款收买外，并委托供销社及棉花交易所、私商花厂以统一的等级牌价进行收购，这样即能达到大小市场上棉都可按牌价出卖。
    二、赊购，如当时棉农用不着现款，而又不能确定卖棉后买什么东西，可以将棉花赊给花纱布公司，这样不但免除自己存储的意外损失和占用房屋外，并且公司还给以下三点好处：（１）保本保值：就是棉农赊给公司棉花，按当时牌价评级，如到期支款时，棉价落了仍按原作价付给现款，如棉价涨了，即按原评等级照涨价付款；（２）利息：凡赊期一个月者给百分之一的利息，二个月为百分之二点五，三个月为百分之四，四个月为百分之六（期再长者不累进），致于期限长短由棉农自定；（３）凡是赊给公司的棉花到期取款，可先买得其他国营专业公司的现有货物（如粮食、煤炭、盐、百货等）。
    三、换购：如棉农想将棉花换成其他物资，可将棉花交到纱布公司（或代理处），由花纱布公司根据各专业公司现有商品牌价，开给手续进行等价交换。
    四、期卖：为了免除棉农对棉花的保管，和保证棉农到一定时期得到一定的物资，实行期卖办法。就是棉农将棉花交给公司，说明自己想要的货物并说明规格和期限，由经营该种商品的专业公司开给正式手续（双方均按当时牌价计算），届时保证付给实物。
    按以上四个收棉办法，无论赊购、换购、期卖只要是与花纱布公司（或代理店）成交，均可由政府和公司两方面的保证实现。
    这样的收棉办法，自实行后，并由政府、团体、学校利用各种会议进行了广泛的宣传，得到广大的农民拥护。市上的卖棉老农这样说：“前一个多月背着棉花来了不好卖，公家说是为了稳定物价暂时缓收，花不着钱可以先放起来，到时候一定给想办法，不叫你们吃亏，当时我不信，到现在公家果然给想出了好多方便办法来，明年我一定还要多种棉花。”
