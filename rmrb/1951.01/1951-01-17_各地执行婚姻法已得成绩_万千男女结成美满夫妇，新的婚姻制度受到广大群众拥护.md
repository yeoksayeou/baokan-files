　　Achievements in the Implementation of the Marriage Law in Various Regions
    Thousands of Men and Women Have Formed Happy Couples; The New Marriage System is Supported by the Broad Masses
    [Our Newspaper News] Since the promulgation of the Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China, it has been warmly welcomed by the broad masses of the people. Thanks to the correct implementation of the marriage policy in various regions, great achievements have been made in the past eight months. Thousands of young men and women have broken through the feudal shackles and formed couples on a voluntary basis; thousands of abused women have also broken free from their suffering and stood up. According to statistics from Beijing Municipality from May to October 1950 alone, there were 6,686 free marriages and 1,279 reasonable divorces. According to statistics from fifteen large and medium-sized cities, including Beijing, Tianjin, Wuhan, Xi'an, Harbin, Tangshan, and Nanchang, and eleven counties, including Ding County, Yanji, Yuci, and Yuncheng, in the four months after the promulgation of the Marriage Law (May to August 1950), a total of 25,330 marriage cases were handled, more than double the 12,351 cases in the four months before the promulgation of the Marriage Law (January to April 1950). Divorce cases accounted for 74 percent of all civil cases, and 98 percent of the reasons for divorce were correct; in 70 to 80 percent of the cases where divorce was initiated, the woman filed.

    The promulgation of the new Marriage Law has brought a happy and beautiful future to the vast numbers of young men and women. Men and women who have escaped from suffering are beginning to plan how to build their own happy lives; people who are already living a happy life are planning how to make their lives even better. As a result, many new-style families have emerged. Chen Xiaoni, a woman from a village in Heshun County, Shanxi Province, was betrothed by her parents to a man she had never met since she was a child. After marriage, she was never at peace and had no interest in production, often thinking of running away. After the promulgation of the Marriage Law, she was granted a divorce and found a beloved partner. After the marriage, the couple often discussed how to make a better life. Chen Xiaoni also influenced nineteen women in the village to participate in production with her active actions, winning praise from the masses. When a pair of young workers from the Dalian Shipyard got engaged, they set the following competition conditions: 1. Guarantee to complete the production tasks ahead of schedule; 2. Humbly study technology and improve product quality; 3. Guarantee to save raw materials; 4. Strive to overcome shortcomings. After that, both sides worked even harder. The woman turned out more than ten more pipe heads than other workers every day and saved more than ten kilograms of gasoline per month, which was praised by the superiors; the man pulled "soft and hardwood," increasing the daily amount from two boxes to five boxes. Under his leadership, other workers also increased from two boxes to four boxes. He was praised and approved to join the Communist Party of China. This pair of advanced young men and women integrated their own happiness with the happiness of the revolutionary family.

    After a series of anti-feudal struggles, the people's level of awareness has been raised, and a new moral concept of honoring labor has been established. Based on this, a new concept of love has been established. Especially after the promulgation of the Marriage Law, the correct concept of love has been established among many people. The saying "Marry a man to get clothes and food" was the marriage concept of women in the old society because they were not economically independent; "Marry a wife, start a family, and have children" was the marriage concept of ordinary men. Now these erroneous marriage views are changing. A woman in Liaodong Province, Northeast China, fell in love with a self-defense team member. Her father strongly opposed it. She explained to her father the reasons for loving him: progressive thinking, good production, and upright style. She finally convinced her father. A woman in a village in Henan Province fell in love with the deputy village chief of her village. Her mother disagreed, and she explained to her mother: "He is good at production and has progressive thinking." And she insisted on getting married. Her mother's thinking was finally broken through. The masses in Yushe, Shanxi, said: In the past, women loved to marry those who wore gowns (landlords, rich peasants, etc.), but now women love to marry those who carry bags (cadres and activists). This is a vivid description of the choice of marriage partners by rural women before and after the promulgation of the Marriage Law. This shows that the vast number of rural women have closely linked their lifelong affairs with their political life.

    Since the promulgation of the Marriage Law, thanks to the enthusiastic support of the broad masses of the people and the correct implementation of the policy by cadres at all levels, the feudal marriage system in old China has been greatly shaken and has begun to disintegrate, and a new marriage system has begun to be established. This new marriage system, new family relationships, new social life, and new social morals will powerfully promote the development of China's political, economic, cultural, and national defense construction.

　　各地执行婚姻法已得成绩
    万千男女结成美满夫妇，新的婚姻制度受到广大群众拥护
    【本报讯】中华人民共和国婚姻法颁布后，受到了广大人民的热烈欢迎。各地由于正确执行了婚姻政策，八个月来，已获得很大成绩。万千青年男女，冲破了封建牢笼，在自愿基础上结成夫妇；万千受虐待的妇女，也摆脱了苦难，站立了起来。仅据北京市一九五○年五月至十月份的统计，自由结婚的就有六千六百八十六对，合理离婚的有一千二百七十九对。据北京、天津、武汉、西安、哈尔滨、唐山、南昌等十五个大中城市和定县、延吉、榆次、郓城等十一个县的统计，婚姻法颁布后的四个月（一九五○年五月至八月）中，共处理婚姻案件二万五千三百三十件，比婚姻法颁布前四个月（一九五○年一月至四月）的一万二千三百五十一件，增加了一倍多。离婚案占全部民事案件的百分之七十四，离婚理由百分之九十八是正确的；主动提出离婚的，女方占百分之七十到八十。
    新婚姻法的颁布，给广大青年男女带来了幸福美丽的远景。摆脱了痛苦的男女，开始计划如何建立自己的美满生活；已经过着幸福生活的人们，则计划着如何使生活过得更美好。因而，不少新式家庭出现了。山西省和顺县某村的陈小妮，从小被父母许配给一个从未见过面的男人，结婚后，一直不安心过日子，对生产也没有兴趣，常想逃跑。婚姻法颁布后，她被批准离婚，并找到了心爱的对象。结婚后，夫妇两人常商量着如何把光景过的更好。陈小妮并以自己的积极行动，影响村里的十九个妇女参加了生产，博得群众的好评。大连造船厂一对青年工人订婚的时候，订下了竞赛条件：一、保证提前完成生产任务；二、虚心钻研技术，提高产品质量；三、保证节约原料；四、努力克服缺点。这以后，双方干活都更有了劲。女的每天比其他工友多车十几车管子头，每月节约汽油十多斤，受到了上级的表扬；男的拉“软硬木”，每天由两箱提高到五箱。在他的带动下，其他工友也由两箱提高到四箱。他受到了表扬，并被批准参加了中国共产党。这一对先进的青年男女，把自己的幸福和革命大家庭里的幸福融汇在一起了。
    经过一连串的反封建斗争，人民的觉悟程度已经提高，并建立了劳动光荣的新道德观念，在这个基础上，树立了新的恋爱观。特别在婚姻法颁布后，正确的恋爱观已在不少群众中建立起来。“嫁汉嫁汉，穿衣吃饭”的谚语，是旧社会里妇女的婚姻观，因为她们经济不能独立；“娶老婆，成家，生孩子”，则是一般男子的婚姻观。现在这些错误的婚姻观点正在改变。东北辽东省有一个女子，爱上了一个自卫队员。父亲却一味反对。她向父亲说明了爱他的理由：思想进步，生产好，作风正派。终于说服了父亲。河南省某村的一位女子爱上了本村的副村长。母亲不同意，她向母亲解释道：“他生产好，思想进步。”并且坚持要结婚。母亲的思想也终于被打通了。山西榆社一带的群众说：从前妇女是爱嫁穿袍袍的（地主、富农等），现在妇女是爱嫁挂包包的（干部和积极分子）。这是在婚姻法颁布前后，农村妇女选择对象的生动描写。这说明广大农村妇女已经把自己的终身大事和自己的政治生活紧紧地连在一起了。
    婚姻法颁布以来，由于广大群众的热烈拥护，由于各级干部对政策的正确执行，已使旧中国的封建婚姻制度发生了巨大震动而开始解体，新的婚姻制度已开始建立。这种新的婚姻制度，新的家庭关系，新的社会生活和新的社会道德，将有力地促进新中国的政治、经济、文化和国防建设的发展。
