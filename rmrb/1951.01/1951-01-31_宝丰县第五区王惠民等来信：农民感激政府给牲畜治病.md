　　Letter from Wang Huimin et al. of the Fifth District of Baofeng County:
    Farmers are grateful to the government for treating livestock
    In November of last year, two very serious contagious livestock diseases were prevalent in the Fifth District of Baofeng County, Henan Province. One was emphysematous anthrax (commonly known as "leg swelling"); the other was anthrax (commonly known as "huang"). In Jiazhai Township, where the livestock disease was more serious, twenty-five livestock died. Traditional Chinese veterinarians had treated them many times without success, and the masses were very panicked. After learning about this, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the Henan Provincial People's Government attached great importance to it and immediately sent a veterinary prevention and treatment team with a large number of medicines to provide treatment. The work team rushed around everywhere in the severe cold and snow to actively serve the masses. From November 21st of last year to January 16th of this year, they injected anthrax vaccine and emphysematous anthrax bacteria into 2,668 livestock, treated 139 sick livestock, and prevented the spread of infectious diseases, so that this year's spring plowing would not be affected. The farmers are very grateful to the government. They said: "In the past, no one cared even when people died; now that the cattle are sick, Chairman Mao has sent people to give them injections."

　　宝丰县第五区王惠民等来信：
    农民感激政府给牲畜治病
    河南省宝丰县五区于去年十一月流行着两种很厉害的牲畜传染病，一种是气肿疽（俗名叫爬腿瘊）；一种是炭疽（俗名叫癀）。畜病较严重的贾寨乡曾死了二十五头牲畜，中兽医曾医治多次不能生效，群众对此很恐慌。河南省人民政府农林厅得知后，对此甚为重视，即派兽医防治队携带大批药品前往救治。工作队在严寒风雪中，到处奔忙，积极地为群众服务。从去年十一月二十一日至今年一月十六日，给二千六百六十八头牲畜注射炭疽疫苗和气肿疽菌，治疗患病牲口一百三十九头，防止了传染病的流行，使今年的春耕不致受影响。农民对于政府非常感激，他们说：过去人死了也没人管；现在牛有了病，毛主席都派人来给打针。
