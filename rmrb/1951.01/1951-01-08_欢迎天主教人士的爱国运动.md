　　Welcoming the Patriotic Movement of Catholics

    In the movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country, Chinese Catholics, following the example of Christians, have begun a patriotic movement of self-reliance and renovation. On November 30th of last year, in Guangyuan County, northern Sichuan, Chinese priest Wang Liangzuo led 500 Catholics in a conference, issuing a declaration advocating severing all ties with imperialists and establishing a new church that is autonomous, self-supporting, and self-propagating. Subsequently, Catholics in Suiyuan, Chongqing, Nanchang, Wuhan, Jiajiang in western Sichuan, and Yuechi in northern Sichuan responded to this proposal. Over 600 Catholics in Guihua City held a renovation symposium on December 19th, deciding to launch this patriotic movement throughout the entire diocese of Sui Dong, Sui Zhong, and Sui Xi. This region has approximately 120,000 to 130,000 Catholics. Shi Mingliang, acting bishop of the Chongqing diocese, and 695 others issued a declaration for the self-reliance and renovation movement in early January. According to incomplete statistics from late December of last year, 894 Catholics in Nanchang had signed in support of the renovation movement. In Jiajiang, western Sichuan, 850 signed, and in Yuechi, northern Sichuan, 121 signed. Seven members of the faculty and staff of Wuhan French-Chinese Middle School also published a letter to all Catholics in Wuhan on December 16th of last year, responding to the declaration of Father Wang Liangzuo of Guangyuan, northern Sichuan.
    Undoubtedly, the renovation movement of Catholics in the aforementioned areas is warmly welcomed by the people of the whole country. As people across the nation actively participate in the movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country, the vast majority of patriotic elements among the approximately three million Catholics nationwide are certainly unwilling to stand apart from the ranks of patriotism. In our nation's history, many patriotic individuals have emerged from among Catholics. The earliest was Xu Guangqi, an outstanding scientist of the late Ming Dynasty, and more recently, Ma Xiangbo, a veteran educator who died during the War of Resistance Against Japan, were both famous patriotic Catholics. Chinese Catholics should inherit and carry forward the patriotic spirit of Xu Guangqi and Ma Xiangbo, enthusiastically participate in the nationwide struggle to resist America and aid Korea, and enthusiastically participate in the self-reliance and renovation movement initiated by Shi Mingliang, Wang Liangzuo, and others.
    Chinese Catholics expressing love for their country does not in any way hinder their religious beliefs. In the new China, freedom of belief is protected by the Common Program. However, in China, Catholicism, like Christianity, is both an object of religious belief and, for a long time, has been used by imperialists as a means to help promote aggression. Regarding the latter, the speech of U.S. Representative to the United Nations, Austin, in the Security Council on November 28th of last year, has already nakedly admitted this. There are many facts about Chinese Catholic organizations being used by imperialists to invade China. The cases of American-Chiang Kai-shek spies uncovered in the Qiqihar Catholic Church in Northeast China and the Zhangjiazhuang Catholic Church in Xian County, Hebei, in 1947 are well-known examples. According to the Hong Kong Chinese Business Daily of July 13th, 1949, Yu Bin's secret agent system was being used by Mao Zhenxiang to gather a group of Catholic students studying in the United States and provide them with secret agent training. At the same time, Lei Zhenyuan was training Catholic priests and monks who fled from North China in Hong Kong, sending them back to the mainland to carry out sabotage. These all prove that many foreign missionaries, under the guise of evangelism, actually served as special agents for American imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries. If these counter-revolutionary elements are not purged from the church, it will inevitably endanger the church's own existence. Every devout religious believer must not allow their church to be used by imperialists as a bloody tool to invade their own country. Therefore, after the spies Shang Jianxun and others were uncovered in Xian County, Cui Buyun, the Jesuit president of the General Church of the Zhangjiazhuang Catholic Diocese in Xian County, and 35 others telegraphed the entire country, declaring Shang Jianxun and others to be "religious scum" and declaring that they would "never recognize them as superiors," and expressing their intention to "reorganize church affairs." This expression is absolutely necessary. Every conscientious Chinese Catholic should stand on the side of patriotism on the fundamental issue of opposing imperialism.
    In order for Chinese Catholics to completely separate their religious beliefs from the conspiracies of imperialist aggressors and spy elements, it is necessary to fundamentally reform the system in which the Chinese Catholic Church is completely controlled by imperialist foreigners.
    Precisely because imperialist elements have for a long time manipulated the high-level organs of the Catholic Church in Rome and the United States, and have for a long time fostered notorious reactionary conspirators like Yu Bin in China to control the affairs of the Chinese Catholic Church, the development of the patriotic movement of Chinese Catholics cannot but go through fierce struggles. Patriotic Catholics must have the courage and determination to break the control of all imperialist elements and their agents within the Catholic Church, not be afraid of any of their intimidation and slander, expose all their illegal sabotage conspiracies, and unite with all patriotic people in China to fight for the bright future of the Chinese Catholic Church. This is the central proposition of Catholics in Sichuan, Suiyuan, Jiangxi, Hubei, and other places. We believe that the vast majority of Catholics across the country, including patriotic ecclesiastical leaders at all levels, will certainly support their renovation propositions after accurately understanding the internal and external environment of the Chinese Catholic Church. Therefore, we hope that Catholics in all regions who have not yet launched a renovation movement, as well as ecclesiastical leaders at all levels, can actively support this movement, so that the renovation work of the Catholic Church in our country can keep pace with the renovation work of Christianity.

　　欢迎天主教人士的爱国运动
    在抗美援朝保家卫国运动中，中国天主教人士，继基督教人士之后，已开始了自立革新的爱国主义运动。去年十一月三十日，川北广元县中国神父王良佐领导五百余天主教徒召开大会，发表宣言，主张与帝国主义者割断各方面的关系，建立自治、自养、自传的新教会。接着有绥远、重庆、南昌、武汉、川西的夹江、川北的岳池等处天主教人士响应这个主张。归绥市天主教人士六百余人于十二月十九日开了革新座谈会，已决定在绥东、绥中、绥西整个教区中开展这一爱国运动。这一个地区的天主教徒，约有十二万至十三万人。重庆天主教区代理主教石明亮等六百九十五人在一月初发表自立革新运动宣言。据去年十二月下旬不完全统计，南昌天主教人士签名赞成革新运动者已达八百九十四人。川西夹江签名者八百五十人，川北岳池签名者一百二十一人。武汉法汉中学七位教友亦曾于去年十二月十六日发表致武汉全市天主教徒书，响应川北广元王良佐神父的宣言。
    毫无疑问，上述各地天主教人士的革新运动，是受到全国人民热烈欢迎的。在全国人民纷纷参加抗美援朝保家卫国运动之际，全国约三百万的天主教徒中的广大爱国分子，绝不甘心自立于爱国主义行列之外。在我国历史上，天主教徒中曾出现过不少爱国志士。最早的如明末优秀的科学家徐光启，较近的如在抗日战争时期逝世的老教育家马相伯，都是著名的爱国的天主教徒。中国天主教徒，应当继承和发扬徐光启和马相伯的爱国精神，踊跃参加全国人民的抗美援朝斗争，并且踊跃参加石明亮、王良佐等所发起的自立革新运动。
    中国天主教徒表示爱自己的国家，丝毫不妨碍自己的宗教信仰。在新中国，信仰是自由的，是受共同纲领保护的。但是，在中国，天主教和基督教一样，一方面是宗教信仰的对象，另一方面又曾在长时期中被帝国主义用为帮助推行侵略的手段。对于后一点，美国驻联合国代表奥斯汀去年十一月二十八日在安理会的演说，已经赤裸裸地供认了。中国的天主教组织被帝国主义利用来侵略中国的事实是很多的。一九四七年在东北齐齐哈尔天主堂和河北献县张家庄天主堂所破获的美蒋间谍案，就是人所共知的例子。据一九四九年七月十三日香港华商报载，于斌的特务系统，正由毛振翔收集一批留美学生中的天主教徒，予以特务训练；同时又由雷振远在香港训练从华北南逃的天主教神父和修士，派回大陆进行破坏。这些都证明有许多外国的传教士以传教为名，实际担任美帝国主义和国民党反动派的特务工作。这种反革命分子，如果不从教会中清洗出去，势必危害教会本身的存在。每一个虔诚的宗教信仰者，绝对不能听任自己所在的教会被帝国主义用来作为血腥的侵略自己国家的工具。因此，在献县的尚建勋等间谍被破获之后，献县张家庄天主教教区总堂耶稣会院长崔步云等三十六人即通电全国，宣布尚建勋等为“宗教之败类”，并声明“永不承认彼等为长上”，并表示“重整教务”。这种表示是完全必要的。每一个有良心的中国教徒，都应当在反对帝国主义这个根本问题上，站在爱国主义这一边。
    中国天主教徒为要使自己的宗教信仰完全和帝国主义侵略分子间谍分子的阴谋活动相隔绝，必须在根本上改革中国天主教会完全受制于帝国主义外国的制度。
    正由于帝国主义分子长时期内操纵着罗马和美国天主教的高级机关，并且在中国长时期内豢养了像于斌之流的罪恶昭彰的反动阴谋家来控制中国天主教的教务，中国天主教徒的爱国运动的发展，就不能不经过激烈的斗争。爱国的天主教徒必须有勇气有决心打破天主教内一切帝国主义分子及其代理人的控制，不怕他们的任何恐吓诬蔑，揭露他们的一切非法破坏阴谋，和全中国爱国人民团结在一起，为中国天主教的光明前途而奋斗。这就是目前四川、绥远、江西、湖北等地天主教徒的中心主张。我们相信，全国绝大多数天主教徒，包括有爱国心的各级教务主持人在内，在确切认识了中国天主教的内外环境以后，必然会赞助他们的革新主张。因此，我们希望现在还未发动革新运动的各地天主教徒，以及各级教务的主持人，能够对这一运动予以积极赞助，使我国天主教的革新工作和基督教的革新工作并驾齐驱。
