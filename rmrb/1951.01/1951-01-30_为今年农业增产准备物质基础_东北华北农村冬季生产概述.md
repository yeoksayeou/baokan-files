Preparing the Material Foundation for Increased Agricultural Production This Year
    ——An Overview of Winter Production in Northeast and North China Rural Areas

    Amidst the great patriotic tide of resisting America, aiding Korea, safeguarding our homes, and defending the nation, the winter production movement in rural areas is flourishing. This movement lays the material foundation for expanded reproduction for this year's spring plowing and large-scale production. The work that farmers in Northeast China, North China (such as Hebei and Shanxi provinces) are currently undertaking – accumulating fertilizer, firewood, coal, purchasing or repairing farm tools, and adjusting seeds – directly prepares for spring plowing and is of extreme importance for increasing agricultural production this year.

    The winter production movement is progressing better in Northeast China and in areas like Hebei and Shanxi in North China. According to a circular issued by the Northeast People's Government's Department of Agriculture and Forestry in early January, Jianchang, Lingyuan, Beipiao, Pingquan, Chengde and other counties in Rehe province, in mid-December last year, had already earned more than 2,500 tons of grain from sideline production; according to statistics from fourteen counties in Heilongjiang province in early December last year, income from winter sideline production will be nearly 300 billion Northeast currency. Winter fertilizer accumulation in Hebei province has exceeded that of previous years. Changzhi and other special districts in Shanxi are enthusiastically carrying out fertilizer, firewood, and coal accumulation, farm tool repair, and seed adjustment work. Sideline production such as iron making and transportation has also been widely launched.

    The main reasons why the winter production movement has been better developed in the above-mentioned areas are the following three points:

    First, the leadership attached great importance to it and carried out specific arrangements and guidance. For example, the Northeast People's Government's Department of Agriculture and Forestry held a meeting of the heads of agricultural and forestry departments of various provinces in early December last year. Based on the current situation and production tasks, it specifically studied and determined the winter rural production work, with the main content being to do a good job in sideline production and prepare for spring plowing. Subsequently, various localities also held relevant winter production meetings and made specific arrangements. Therefore, after December, winter production in Northeast China rapidly developed and achieved results. However, in some areas, either because of satisfaction with last year's bumper harvest and failure to promptly overcome complacency among cadres and farmers, or emphasizing that the tasks were heavy and there was too much work, they did not coordinate the various tasks but thought they were contradictory, resulting in laissez-faire and affecting the development of winter production work.

    Second, labor models and well-organized mutual aid teams in the above-mentioned areas launched patriotic winter production competitions. In November last year, Han En and Li Shunda, nationally renowned labor models from Jilin and Shanxi respectively, proposed to labor models in Northeast and Shanxi provinces to do a good job in patriotic competition for winter agricultural and sideline production. In Northeast China, many labor models and mutual aid teams in Jilin, Heilongjiang, Songjiang, and Liaoxi provinces responded. In Shanxi, more than forty labor models in four special districts have responded to Li Shunda's challenge. In Li Shunda's own Pingshun county, ninety-six mutual aid teams responded, and in Wuxiang there were one hundred and two villages, thus creating a winter production upsurge.

    Third, cooperative organization work was well done. For example, after the farmers of Heping Village Cooperative in Suihua County, Heilongjiang, responded to Han En's competition call, village director Xu Hongkuan and three cooperative cadres conducted household-by-household surveys, carried out supply and marketing work, and signed contracts with production groups to specifically lead farmers' sideline production and purchase farm tools, adjust seeds, and other spring plowing preparation work. For example, Jin County Cooperative in Liaoxi Province, at the beginning of winter production work, printed the names, specifications, and prices of various local sideline products into a booklet, distributed it to cooperatives in various provinces to entrust them with finding sales channels, and successfully sold 130,000 cattail bags and cattail mats, and continued to receive large orders. At the same time, the cooperative clearly specified the product specifications in the contract when purchasing finished products from production groups, and frequently sent people to inspect the implementation, thus avoiding the stagnation of sales caused by products not meeting specifications, so that sideline production achieved great results.

　　为今年农业增产准备物质基础
    ——东北华北农村冬季生产概述
    在伟大的抗美援朝保家卫国的爱国浪潮中，各地农村的冬季生产运动正蓬勃展开。这一运动给今年的春耕大生产打下了扩大再生产的物质基础。东北、华北等地区的农民正在进行的积肥、积柴、积煤、购买或修补农具、调剂种籽等工作，更直接为春耕进行了准备，对于今年的农业增产有着极端重要意义。
    冬季生产运动的开展，以东北各地、华北地区的河北、山西等地较好。据东北人民政府农林部一月上旬发出的通报，热河省建昌、凌源、北票、平泉、承德等县，在去年十二月中，即已由副业生产收入粮食两千五百余吨；黑龙江省去年十二月上旬十四个县的统计，冬季副业生产收入将近东北币三千亿。河北省冬季积肥已超过往年。山西长治等专区正热烈地进行着积肥、积柴、积煤、修补农具、调剂种籽等工作，副业方面的制铁、运输等生产也已普遍开展。
    上述地区冬季生产运动开展得较好的原因，主要的有以下三点：
    第一是领导重视，进行了具体布置和指导。如东北人民政府农林部，早在去年十二月初，即召开了各省农林厅长会议，根据当前形势与生产任务，具体研究并确定了冬季农村生产工作，以搞好副业生产和准备春耕为主要内容，接着各地也大部召开了有关冬季生产的会议，进行了具体布置，因而十二月份以后，东北各省的冬季生产即迅速开展并获得成绩。但在某些地区，或者由于满足去年的丰收，没有及时克服干部和农民中的自满情绪；或者强调任务重、工作多，不是使各项工作互相配合进行而是以为互相矛盾，以致放任自流，影响冬季生产工作的开展。
    第二是在上述地区的劳动模范和组织较好的互助组，展开了爱国主义的冬季生产竞赛。去年十一月间，吉林和山西的全国著名劳动模范韩恩、李顺达，即分别向东北和山西省各地劳动模范提出作好冬季农副业生产的爱国主义竞赛。在东北，吉林、黑龙江、松江、辽西等省的许多劳动模范和互助组即纷纷响应；在山西，响应李顺达挑战的已有四个专区的四十余位劳动模范，在李顺达本人所在的平顺县应战的即有九十六个互助组，在武乡有一百零二个村，因而造成了冬季生产的热潮。
    第三是合作社组织工作作得好。如黑龙江绥化县和平村合作社，在全村农民响应韩恩的竞赛号召后，即由村主任徐洪宽及合作社干部三人，进行逐户调查，开展供销工作，并和生产小组订立合同，具体地领导了农民的副业生产和购买农具、调剂种籽等春耕准备工作。又如辽西省锦县合作社，冬季生产工作一开始，便把当地各种副业产品的名称、规格、价钱印成表册，分发到各省合作社委托代找销路，顺利地推销了十三万个蒲包和蒲草垫子，并又继续得到大批订货。同时该合作社在向生产小组收购成品时，在合同中均详细写明产品规格，又经常派人检查执行情形，因而避免了产品不合规格而产生的滞销现象，使副业生产获得了很大的成绩。
