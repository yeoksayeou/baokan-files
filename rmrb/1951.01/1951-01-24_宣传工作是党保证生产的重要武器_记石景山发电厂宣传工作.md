　　Propaganda Work is an Important Weapon for the Party to Guarantee Production
    ——A Record of Propaganda Work at Shijingshan Power Plant
    By Our Correspondent Pei Lan
  I. Turning the Leadership's Intentions into Mass Action
    "Propaganda and mobilization work is one of the important weapons for the Party to conduct supervision and guarantee production in enterprises!" Wang Zimian, the Party Branch Secretary of the Shijingshan Power Plant, often used this to encourage the plant's propaganda workers. Therefore, the plant's propaganda workers can pay attention to carrying out propaganda work according to the production tasks, and turning the leadership's intentions into mass action. In May of last year, newspapers published news that the coal consumption of power plants in Tianjin, Tangshan, and other places had been reduced to 0.62 and 0.58; while the coal consumption of Shijingshan Plant was 0.85, a big difference. Thus, reducing coal consumption became an important key to reducing costs for the plant. So the Party branch suggested that the administration hold a meeting to study the issue. Soon, the plant, based on its specific conditions, proposed a struggle to reduce coal consumption to 0.78. Therefore, the propaganda workers held report meetings and workshop group meetings everywhere to convey this call, using various methods to make all the plant's employees deeply aware of the significance of reducing coal consumption. Comrade Li Ximing, a propaganda worker, drew a large cartoon with a big red flag on it, on which was written the call of the Electric Power Administration to "Reduce Coal Consumption and Reduce Costs." Behind the flag followed several strong workers, holding signs that read "Tangshan Power Plant's Coal Consumption Reduced to 0.58" and "Tianjin Power Plant's Coal Consumption Reduced to 0.62." Finally, there was a large broken leather shoe, with a worker sitting in it with a broken foreign umbrella, and on his sign was written: "The capital's power plant's coal consumption is 0.85." Above it were written these big characters: "Comrades, we are sitting in a large broken leather shoe, being dragged along by others, it's really embarrassing! We must work hard and strive to reduce coal consumption to 0.78." After this cartoon was posted, it caused a sensation throughout the plant. Workers were talking about the "big leather shoe" at work, during breaks, and while eating. Some workers couldn't sleep because of it, and were thinking about how to reduce coal consumption. Various workshops launched heated discussions on this issue. Workers at the pulverized coal furnace wrote on the pulverized coal bin: "Strive not to sit in the big broken leather shoe." "Don't sit in the big leather shoe" and "Strive for 0.78" became the unified goals of all the plant's employees. At this time, the propaganda workers further proposed the specific slogans: "No black smoke from above, no black coal escaping from below" (Note 1). The workers on the third floor of the pulverized coal furnace said: "We must achieve 'no vomiting or diarrhea, no tumors in the stomach'." (Note 2). The turbine plant proposed: "Strive to reduce the circulating water temperature by one to two degrees"... These vivid and practical slogans immediately became the actions of the masses. When it was summarized at the end of May, coal consumption had been reduced to 0.767.
  II. Paving the Way Forward for Production
    Last year, the plant had frequent accidents, so the leadership issued a call to the workers to "Eliminate Accidents and Generate Electricity Safely." However, many workers lacked confidence, saying, "It's an old power plant that has been around for three generations, there are hundreds of rollers, it's impossible not to have accidents." "If you want to have no accidents, the sun would have to rise in the west." In response to this ideological situation, the propaganda workers carried out in-depth propaganda and education work, and helped the workers to specifically analyze the causes of accidents. After the workers found the reasons, they put forward the slogan "Close the windows when it rains and blows." The propaganda workers wrote this slogan on a sign and hung it next to the window as a safety sign. This simple and clear slogan played a great role in ensuring safety. Soon, the 3,000 KVA transformer was burned down for the second time, and the workers were really a little anxious. After everyone carefully checked, they found that because the workers in the repair team had removed the suction fan and had not plugged the ground screw holes, rainwater had seeped in, so the transformer was burned down. Therefore, the propagandist (a propagandist had been established at this time) put forward the slogan: "Clean up after you finish your work." The workers added another sentence: "Wipe your butt after you shit." This attracted the attention of the maintenance team and all the plant's employees, reducing the occurrence of accidents. At this time, the propagandist further put forward the slogan "Whoever repairs the machine is responsible for it, whoever watches the machine is responsible for it, and strive to have no accidents in July." This call was enthusiastically responded to by all the plant's employees. The mobile newspapers in each workshop were filled with various slogans. Some mobile newspapers read: "Strive not to have a crippled arm or a crippled leg!" As a result, the plant created a new record of eighty-three days without accidents.
    After the production competition movement was launched, the propagandist also created a competition board, on which the achievements of each workshop or individual worker were recorded daily in simple and clear numbers. Workers always went to look at the results on the competition board after work. The competition board played the role of supervising and inspecting production. During the mid-month inspection, the propagandist also designed a production progress chart, which read: "Comrade, half a month has passed, check how much of your work has been completed?" After Han Boqin from the turbine plant saw it, he immediately reported their production achievements. In the afternoon, the production progress chart read: "The turbine plant has completed nine of the twelve projects, no problem!" So each workshop competed to report its production achievements. The groups with slower progress also actively looked for ways to complete their plans.
    Since the proposal to eliminate the 2119 hidden accidents, more than 1,300 pieces have been repaired by the end of the year, which has avoided the occurrence of hidden accidents. The plant's accidents reached as many as 108 in January of last year, and the number of ordinary accidents in the entire month of December has been reduced to four. Li Fengming's team also created a new record of one year of accident-free operation, and won the honorary title of model team.
  III. Commending Advanced Elements, Criticizing Backward Elements, and Promoting Production Further
    The plant's propagandists understand: If we really want to complete the task of guaranteeing and supervising production, we must promptly commend and encourage the advanced in production, and criticize the backward. For example, in cartoons or on competition boards, give the advanced in production a big red flag and a "car"; for the backward in production, give them a "duck cart." This is a great encouragement to the workers. Throughout the plant, one could often hear workers discussing "red flags, cars, and duck carts." The Liu Dezhen model team and Yang Qigan's advanced shift (three shifts rotate every day, each shift is eight hours, a shift is different from a general shift) both went to work with big red flags and sat in "cars" on the competition board. Their photos and model deeds were also published on the honor roll, and the radio station broadcast their model deeds to the entire plant and their family members. In this way, they were even more energetic and produced even better. Zhu Zhimu's shift fell behind and rode a "duck cart." Zhu Zhimu and his team held a "duck cart" meeting, reviewed the reasons for riding the "duck cart," and formulated a plan to win the red flag. In August, the red flag was indeed planted in their workshop.
    (Note 1) If the boiler coal is burned well, it emits white smoke and leaves white ash; otherwise, it emits black smoke and black coal escapes.
    (Note 2) "No vomiting or diarrhea" and "No black smoke from above, no black coal escaping from below" mean the same thing. No tumors in the stomach means no unburned coke is left.

　　宣传工作是党保证生产的重要武器
    ——记石景山发电厂宣传工作
    本报记者  培蓝
  一、把领导意图变为群众行动
    “宣传鼓动工作是党在企业中，进行监督与保证生产的重要武器之一！”石景山发电厂中共总支书记王自勉经常以此来鼓动该厂宣传工作人员。因此该厂宣传工作人员都能够注意根据生产任务进行宣传工作，把领导意图变为群众行动。去年五月份，报纸上登载着天津、唐山等地发电厂煤耗已降低到○·六二与○·五八的新闻；而石景山厂煤耗却是○·八五，相差很多。这样降低煤耗就成为该厂减低成本的一个重要关键。于是总支建议行政召开会议研究。不久，该厂根据本厂具体情况，提出了为降低煤耗至○·七八而斗争。于是宣传工作人员，到处召开报告会，车间小组会，传达这一号召，用各种办法使全厂职工深刻地认识了降低煤耗的意义。宣传工作人员李锡铭同志画了一幅大漫画，漫画上画着一面大红旗，上写着电业总局的“降低煤耗、减低成本”的号召。旗后就跟着几个身强力壮的工人，手持写着“唐山发电厂煤耗降低到○·五八”、“天津发电厂煤耗降低到○·六二”的牌子。最后是一只大破皮鞋，一个工人打着一把破洋伞坐在破皮鞋里，在他的牌子上写着：“首都发电厂煤耗○·八五。”上面还写着这样几个大字：“同志们，我们坐在大破皮鞋里，让别人拉着走，实在丢人啊！我们要努力，为降低煤耗至○·七八而斗争”。这张漫画贴出后，轰动了全厂。工友们上班、休息、吃饭都在谈论着“大皮鞋”。有的工人因此睡不着觉，在想降低煤耗的问题。各车间为此展开了热烈的讨论。煤粉炉的工人在煤粉槽上写着：“为不坐大破皮鞋而斗争”。“不坐大皮鞋”、“为○·七八而斗争”，已成为全厂职工一致奋斗的目标。这时宣传工作人员进一步的提出：“上不冒黑烟、下不跑黑煤”（注一）的具体口号。煤粉炉三楼的工人说：我们要作到：“不上吐下泻，肚子里不生瘤子”。（注二）汽机厂提出：“为降低循环水温一度至二度而斗争”……这些生动而实际的口号，立刻成为群众的行动。到五月底总结时，煤耗降低到○·七六七。
  二、为生产开拓前进的道路
    去年该厂经常发生事故，领导上因此向工人发出了“消灭事故、安全发电”的号召。可是，好多工人没有信心，他们说：“老少三代的破电厂，滚子就有几百个，不出事故不可能”。“要不出事故，除非太阳从西边出来。”宣传工作人员针对这种思想情况，进行了深入的宣传教育工作，并帮助工人具体分析发生事故的原因。工人们找出原因后，就提出了“下雨刮风关窗子”的口号。宣传工作人员就把这个口号写在一个牌子上，当作安全牌，挂在窗户旁边。这个简单明确的口号，在保证安全上起了很大的作用。不久，三千ＫＶＡ变压器第二次被烧毁，工人们真有点着急。经过大家仔细检查后，发现了因为修理班的工人拆走吸风机后，没有把地角螺丝洞堵好，浸进了雨水，所以变压器被烧毁了。于是宣传员（这时已建立了宣传员）提出了：“干完活要收摊”的口号。工人自己又添了一句：“拉完屎要擦屁股”。这就引起了检修班及全厂职工的注意，减少了事故的发生。这时宣传员进一步提出了“谁修的机器谁负责，谁看的机器谁负责，争取七月份不出事故”的口号。这个号召得到全厂职工的热烈响应，各车间的流动报写满了各种口号，有的流动报上写着：“争取不瘸胳臂不瘸腿！”结果全厂创造了八十三天没有事故的新纪录。
    生产竞赛运动展开后，宣传员又创造了竞赛牌，每天把各车间或个别工人的成绩，用简单明确的数字记上去。工友们下班后总要去看看竞赛牌上的成绩。竞赛牌就发挥了监督与检查生产的作用。月中检查时，宣传员又设计了一张生产进度表，表上写着：“同志，半月过去了，检查一下你的工作完成了多少？”汽机厂韩伯勤看到后，马上报告了他们的生产成绩。下午生产进度表上就写上了：“汽机厂十二件工程已完成九件，没问题！”于是各车间都争先汇报自己的生产成绩。进度较慢的组也积极想办法，完成自己的计划。
    自从提出消灭二一一九隐性事故后，到年底总结时，已修理了一千三百多件，就避免了隐性事故的发生。该厂去年一月份事故曾达到一百零八件之多，十二月份全月已减为四件普通事故。李凤鸣小组并创造了运转一年无事故的新纪录，荣获了模范小组的光荣称号。
  三，表扬先进分子、批评落后分子，把生产推进一步
    该厂宣传员了解：真正要完成保证与监督生产的任务，必须及时地表扬与鼓励生产先进者，批评落后者。例如在漫画或竞赛牌上，给生产先进者，画个大红旗，坐“汽车”；对生产落后的，就给坐个“鸭子车”。这对工人鼓励很大。全厂经常可以听到工人在议论：“红旗、汽车、鸭子车”。刘德珍模范小组，杨其淦先进值班（每天三班轮流值班，每值班八小时，值班不同于一般的班）都是打着大红旗上班，在竞赛牌上坐着“汽车”，光荣榜上也登了他们的像片和模范事迹，广播站向全厂及工人家属广播了他们的模范事迹。这样他们劲头更大，生产更好。朱致墨值班落了后，就坐了“鸭子车”。朱致墨他们就召开了一个“鸭子车”大会，检讨坐“鸭子车”的原因，并订出了夺取红旗的计划。八月份红旗果然插在他们的车间了。
    （注一）锅炉煤烧的好的，冒白烟，剩白灰；否则即冒黑烟，跑黑煤。
    （注二）“不上吐下泻”和“上不冒黑烟，下不跑黑煤”是一个意思。肚子里不生瘤子，就是不留烧不透的焦块。
