　　Criticism and Book Reviews in Newspapers
    Chashlavsky
    Editor's note: The "criticism" in "Criticism and Book Reviews" mentioned in this article specifically refers to literary criticism. Also, the meaning of the word "propaganda" in this article specifically refers to the propaganda of Marxism-Leninism, which is equivalent to the term "theoretical education" in our country. According to the resolutions of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), Soviet newspapers above the provincial level generally have a criticism and book review department and a propaganda department.
    The significance of literary criticism has been very sharply and particularly powerfully raised in the resolutions of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) on August 14 and 26, and September 4, 1946, regarding the errors and shortcomings in literature, art, film, and other aspects.
    In the resolution of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) regarding the magazines "Star" and "Leningrad," we can read:
    "The ideological shortcomings of the leaders of 'Star' and 'Leningrad' simultaneously made the relationship between these leaders and writers not based on the interests of correctly educating Soviet people and politically guiding the activities of writers, but on personal interests, the interests of friends. Due to unwillingness to damage friendships, criticism became dull. Due to fear of offending friends, completely useless works were even allowed to be printed. This is a kind of liberalism that sacrifices the interests of the people and the country, the interests of correctly educating our youth, to the interests of friendships; because of it, criticism is silenced; the result of this liberalism is that writers no longer improve, the sense of responsibility to the people, the country, and the Party is lost, and progress ceases." ①
    The resolution regarding theater performances states:
    "The unsatisfactory state of theater performances is also due to the lack of principled Bolshevik drama criticism. There are only a very few experts in the Soviet publishing industry who serve as drama critics. Newspapers, literary magazines, and drama magazines rarely promote new critics who are good at objectively and impartially analyzing scripts and theatrical art. Some critics, when evaluating scripts and performances, are not guided by the interests of the ideological and artistic development of Soviet script creation and stage art, that is to say, they are not guided by the interests of the state and the people, but by the interests of small groups, friends, and individuals. Many articles reviewing performances published in newspapers are often written by people who do not understand art. In these articles, there is no concrete analysis of the new performances, but subjective and arbitrary criticisms that are not commensurate with the true meaning and level of the performances. The reviews of scripts and performances are often written in meaningless language that is difficult for readers to understand. 'Pravda,' 'Izvestia,' 'Komsomolskaya Pravda,' and 'Trud' do not adequately estimate the great educational significance of theatrical performances, and therefore devote very little space to artistic issues." ②
    A special article is put forward in the resolution:
    "Recognizing the important role of criticism in the development of theatrical art, the editorial departments of 'Pravda,' 'Izvestia,' 'Komsomolskaya Pravda,' 'Trud,' 'Soviet Art Newspaper,' and 'Literary Newspaper' are specially instructed to absorb politically mature and technically proficient drama and literary critics to engage in newspaper work, systematically publish articles reviewing new scripts and performances, and resolutely fight against the political indifference and lack of ideology in drama criticism.
    "The editorial departments of newspapers in various republics, border regions, and provinces are instructed to systematically publish articles and reviews on new dramas performed in local theaters." ③
    This refers to drama reviews, but what is said above also applies to literary criticism and scientific criticism. This is not merely similar. Any drama review, assuming that it is not also a literary review, cannot be a satisfactory review that is responsible for the task of educating the people.
    In our newspapers, especially in local newspapers, there is a common review method that limits its task to mainly criticizing the acting skills of the actors. Some reviewers, after watching a play, come back and assign scores to the actors, giving them praise or condemnation respectively.
    Some people think that this kind of reviewer is an expert who understands theatrical art. The actors who are praised by him are very satisfied and think that this reviewer is good and understands drama very well. And those actors who are scolded by him think that this is a very ignorant and bad critic.
    This method of evaluation by giving compliments and insults separately is unacceptable in drama, literature, and any general criticism.
    Drama reviewers should first expose the ideological content of the drama and the social nature of the stage image; they should point out what is good in a certain drama, and where this drama helps to educate our people, or conversely, point out where it is harmful and incorrectly portrays Soviet people, distorting the image of Soviet people. In order to write this kind of review, one must first master the theoretical weapon of Marxism-Leninism and be able to critically analyze the materials provided to us by the stage, that is, the platform.
    Of course, it is also necessary to criticize the actors' performances and the director's skills, but the task of criticism does not end there. The most important thing is to analyze the ideological and political factors of this or that artistic image. Exposing the socio-political content of artistic images is the primary task of literary criticism articles and reviews. However, this does not mean that the author cannot criticize the form of art.
    The resolution on the film "The Great Life" exposed the ignorance of some authors and directors. These authors and directors exposed their lack of knowledge of Soviet life and depicted a distorted picture of Donbass. Some directors also distorted Russian history in films depicting Nakhimov and Ivan the Terrible. But the fault in this regard lies not only with the screenwriters and performers. Critics who incorrectly praised works, scripts, and films should also bear half the responsibility for the errors in the scripts and films.
    The importance of the resolutions of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) on the shortcomings and errors on the ideological education front is extremely clear. This is a combat program for our criticism work in literature, art, and science.
    The Party has more than once aroused Soviet public opinion and the Soviet press to pay attention to the task of Party-minded criticism.
    Let us recall one of the most important documents related to criticism and book reviews—the resolution of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in 1940. This resolution pointed out:
    "Literary criticism and book reviews, as a serious weapon of propaganda and communist education, are now in a state of extreme confusion.
    "In most newspapers and magazines, literary criticism materials have almost disappeared recently. The promotional book review work, which is of great significance in improving the political and cultural technical level of the masses, is not satisfactory. Until now, bibliographic references, recommended bibliographies for readers of various sciences, and reference book indexes for various professions have not been completed.
    The work of criticism and book reviews is divorced from the actual needs of socialist construction."
    The Central Committee pointed out: "... Literary criticism is currently the weakest link. Most critics do not study the various issues of Soviet literature, and do not give it influence on its growth. Contrary to the traditions of Russian literature, critics are unwilling to do the work of magazine editors who can unite writers, and instead close themselves in the isolated group of the writers' association's criticism department."
    The Central Committee then formulated a series of measures to fundamentally improve literary criticism and book reviews. The editorial departments of literary magazines should set up permanent criticism and book review departments. The editorial departments of "Pravda," "Izvestia," "Komsomolskaya Pravda," "Trud," "Red Star," all republic, border region, and provincial newspapers, as well as newspapers and magazines in scientific and production departments, should organize criticism and book reviews in their own pages.
    The criticism and book review departments of general political central newspapers and magazines, in addition to reviewing individual works and book reviews, should also systematically review various scientific and knowledge books. The editorial departments of theoretical and general political central magazines should, on the one hand, publish literary criticism articles and reviews of the most urgently needed books, and on the other hand, organize book reviews and reviews for books that readers are most eager to see. The republic, border region, and provincial newspapers should systematically publish recommended bibliographies and articles on the most important literary works, and at the same time ensure that all books published locally are reviewed. Production department newspapers and magazines should organize permanent criticism and book review departments, and systematically review all specialized books published every day. The publication of reviews of books in each production department should not be less than once per quarter.
    Special attention should be paid to the statement in the resolution that literary criticism and book reviews are serious weapons of propaganda and communist education.
    In the actual work of our newspapers, one can encounter such a view that the propaganda department of the newspaper takes propaganda as its main task, and all other materials seem not to be propaganda.
    Of course, this is incorrect. All departments of newspapers and magazines play a propaganda role. News reports are not necessarily worse than essays as serious propaganda weapons. However, in reality, people often think that only essays, and only essays with certain characteristics, certain styles, and certain genres, are propaganda.
    In order to oppose this simple view, the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) pointed out directly that critical articles and reviews are serious propaganda weapons.
    Having a criticism and book review department does not hinder other departments, especially the propaganda department, from participating in literary and scientific criticism. All departments of newspapers and magazines should pay attention to books and publications within their professional scope. All Soviet newspaper staff should understand books, read books, and love books. Generally speaking, the leaders of all departments agree with this point, but they usually decline, saying that they are busy with business issues and do not have time to read and criticize books and publications. Therefore, neither reviewing books and publications within their professional scope nor reviewing individual books is included in their plans. However, it is important to know that criticism and book review work cannot be done well unless it becomes the responsibility of all departments. The criticism and book review department should not only prepare to publish its own materials, but also stand on the position that criticism and book review is a serious weapon of propaganda and communist education, and call on all departments of the newspaper or magazine to jointly do criticism work. Because it is a very powerful weapon.
    Reviewing books and publications can provide extremely vivid and expressive materials. This is not only completely in line with the rules, but also a traditional method of Bolshevik propaganda. Many literary works, precisely because they are rich in vivid images, can provide satisfactory materials for the propaganda of Marxism-Leninism and for the propaganda of the basic ideas of our Party's policies. For example, the image of Paul Kochakin in Ostrovsky's "How the Steel Was Tempered" and the image of the young Red Don in Fadeyev's "The Young Guard" have great propaganda significance.
    Special attention should be paid to the Central Committee's instruction that the work of criticism and book reviews should be closely integrated with the actual needs of socialist construction.
    Recently, there has been a mechanical division between the issue of literary criticism and the issue of socialist construction in our newspapers and magazines. Reviews of books on economic construction are occasionally published once or twice. The editors of the industrial and agricultural departments of the newspapers have not taken systematically reviewing specialized books published every day as their task, and literary criticism often views literary works separately from the actual needs of socialism.
    The Central Committee's resolution instructed the central, republic, and provincial newspapers to organize criticism and book reviews in their own pages. That is to say, the publication of critical articles is not allowed to be fragmented or accidental. This work must be regular. The editors should know what is happening in the literary world. Pay attention to it every day. As long as you don't do this for two or three months, then you leave a gap that is not easy to fill. The editors should be clear about the publication situation.
    The central newspapers should regularly review the scientific and knowledge books of various departments.
    The republic, border region, and provincial newspapers must regularly publish recommended bibliographies and review books published locally. It is not easy for the central newspapers to take care of the publication work in various places, especially the books in various languages of the various nationalities of the Soviet Union. And there are often many errors in these books. Of course, the central newspapers should take care of these books. It has a widespread communication network for these purposes. But the republic, provincial, and local newspapers should take on greater responsibilities. It cannot be said that the work of the newspaper is to publish newspapers, and the local publication work is to publish books. The newspaper editorial department should carefully pay attention to the books and publications published in the province. But our republic and provincial newspapers cannot be said to have been competent in this task. The newspapers in various places hardly react to the activities of local publication work.
    In the publication work of Ukraine, Georgia, Azerbaijan, and other republics, a series of nationalist distortions and tendencies have been found in literary works. And not only in literary works. For example, the Belarusian "Belarusian History Publishing House" published a work by a local historian. This book made some very big mistakes.
    The literary criticism in our publishing industry is flawed and accidental. In addition, its level is not high. Often it is simply ignorant criticism.
    Andreyev spoke in January 1936 about the requirements for children's literature criticism. His words apply not only to children's literature. He said:
    "What else is needed for the smooth growth of children's literature, and also for the smooth growth of general literature? Criticism! Not the kind of ignorant criticism that often does not distinguish the essence of the problem and makes a young writer feel discouraged for a typo or one or two unsuccessful sentences. Our literary critics—unfortunately, there are very few critics now—often do not keenly and carefully criticize the advantages and disadvantages of this or that work, but simply either give a general praise or a general condemnation. This kind of criticism is not what we need. We need keen and principled criticism, which can expose the real shortcomings of this or that work, and at the same time clean up everything rotten, alien, and unhealthy in literature, to teach writers and encourage their growth and their progress. Is there such criticism in our literary world? No, the formation of this kind of criticism is still early. Our publishing institutions, newspapers, and magazines pay extremely insufficient attention to this most important thing, and even the literary self-criticism of the writers themselves in their own ranks is developing very weakly."
    These words were said in 1936, but these instructions have not lost their meaning today. In our newspapers, especially in local newspapers, unfortunately, examples of general praise or general condemnation can be found, and examples of ignorant, insincere criticism that plays with words like playing with small sticks can be found.
    After the Party Central Committee's resolution on criticism and book reviews in 1940 was published, this work greatly increased in our newspapers. The war had somewhat hindered it. The number of books published decreased. The pages of the newspapers were reduced. Of course, this does not mean that any criticism and book review work has stopped. Everyone remembers that this work was also carried out during the war, and it was carried out in connection with the actual tasks of national defense. We can take Kornechuk's play "The Front" as an example—it was published in "Pravda," and "Pravda" wrote a long critical article for it that made people understand the main points of the play.
    The Party also gave serious significance to the work of criticism and book reviews during the war.
    Soviet literature and scientific criticism have very rich traditions that can be boldly said to be absent in any other national literature. Regarding these traditions, Zhdanov said in his report on the magazines "Star" and "Leningrad":
    "Marxist literary criticism, that is, the successor to the great traditions of Belinsky, Chernyshevsky, and Dobrolyubov, has always been the protector of realistic art with a certain social purpose. In order to expose that idealistic and unscientific concept of literature and art, in order to defend the basic principles of our great Russian revolutionary democrats, who taught us to regard literature as a powerful means of serving the people, Plekhanov has done a lot of work in this regard." ④
    It also said: "Therefore, the excellent traditions of Soviet literature are the continuation of the excellent traditions of 19th-century Russian literature, the continuation of the traditions created by our great revolutionary democrats Belinsky, Dobrolyubov, Chernyshevsky, and Saltykov-Shchedrin, continued by Plekhanov, and finally laid the foundation by Lenin and Stalin with scientific methods." ⑤
    The merit of the great Marxist-Leninist pioneers in Russia lies in their enthusiastic and Party-minded struggle against reactionary forces, against lack of ideology and political indifference, and in their principled defense of the basic principles of democracy in politics and realism in literature.
    The method they used was mainly the method of critically analyzing literary works. This is a kind of political propaganda, a kind of political propaganda that is extremely powerful in content, but mainly composed of literary materials. Belinsky wrote many long literary critical articles, but he also wrote many short articles reviewing various books, some of which were even less than sixty to one hundred lines. He seemed to be nothing more than a literary critic, and therefore, in a certain period, he was able to withstand the censorship of Nicholas's gendarmes, but in fact, readers found the propaganda of the progressive ideas of the early 19th century in his works.
    In our newspapers, a very good prophecy of Belinsky is often cited. He wrote in 1840: "We envy our descendants who can see Russia in 1940—at that time, Russia is standing at the forefront of the educated world, giving laws to science and art, and receiving the respected gifts of all educated human beings..."
    These few sentences are full of profound historical significance. And these few sentences were written in a book review for the publication of the 1840 calendar. Belinsky's works have many reviews of this kind—containing great philosophical and historical ideas in a small space.
    This is an excellent example of a book review as a serious propaganda weapon. A calendar, an ordinary 1840 calendar, was immediately seized by Belinsky. Another reviewer would have written like this: what book was published, how many pages, how it was printed, and what the content was. He may also add a little bit and say: this book is beneficial and worth noting. Such a review cannot play a big role in political propaganda. But Belinsky started from another point of view, he believed that the calendar reflects the events of the year, it is a signpost of the historical process of the development of the Russian people, so he was good at writing the genius prophecy that we now read with excitement every time. How sharp was this critic's vision, able to foresee our 1940 in the darkness, in the prison of the Nicholas era!
    Let us recall another work of Belinsky—his famous letter to Gogol, which Lenin called one of the most excellent democratic documents. Just for reading this letter, the Tsarist government sentenced Dostoevsky to death, and later replaced the death penalty with hard labor. In Belinsky's letter to Gogol, a fiery revolutionary enthusiasm is expressed. But what is this letter about? It is about Gogol's literary works, about his "Excerpts from Correspondence with Friends."
    Dobrolyubov's excellent essay "A Ray of Light in the Dark Kingdom" is about Ostrovsky's play "The Storm." And the young people who lived at the same time as Dobrolyubov regarded this literary critical essay as a revolutionary democratic program.
    The literary criticism and scientific criticism essays of Chernyshevsky and Pisarev also belong to this category.
    All these critical articles are full of social content. They are a kind of political essay-style criticism, that is to say, this kind of criticism not only analyzes the artistic advantages and disadvantages of the works, but also exposes the social content of these works, analyzes the characteristics of the artistic images, and uses these to develop and promote certain political ideas.
    Or someone will say that these great critics, revolutionary democrats, had to do this because of the conditions of censorship, because the Tsarist censorship system did not allow direct propaganda of revolutionary democratic ideas. Of course, if Belinsky was born in our era, he would first be an outstanding political commentator. He would not only be a literary critic. The political commentators of our era no longer need to use literary criticism to cover themselves in order to express and promote political ideas. We do this directly. But still, we cannot only use the conditions of censorship to explain why we chose this literary genre. The problem is not only here.
    Literary works themselves are very important materials for improving understanding. They reflect life. They are a source of important social ideas.
    Lenin's some classic and brilliant essays on Tolstoy contain the most important principles of the peasant revolution. Lenin regarded Tolstoy's works as a "mirror of the Russian revolution." This is an example of an outstanding political essay written with artistic materials, and it is also a model of Marxist Party-minded literary criticism, and the skills of such criticism should be learned by all our writers.
    Lenin taught our writers to learn Party-minded criticism. In a letter to Gorky on February 7, 1908, he wrote: "Oh, in the long and lengthy literary critical essays in various semi-Party and non-Party magazines, there is nothing to be gained! We had better leave this old-fashioned, lord-like style of intellectuals a little further away, that is to say, we must integrate literary criticism more closely with the work of the Party and with the leadership of the Party. This is what the mature social democrats in Europe do."
    The tradition of political essay criticism is like this. These traditions still retain their entire life today. Literary criticism should not be divorced from life or from struggle. It should be Party-minded criticism, which means that it should be closely integrated with the actual needs of socialist construction.
    However, there are essential shortcomings in the criticism work of our newspapers and magazines. The instructions issued by the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) on literature, drama, and film are fully applicable to criticism work. Criticism must be particularly responsible for the shortcomings and errors in literary and artistic works, as well as scientific works. Criticism should point out and analyze works that make mistakes in a timely manner. It often does not do this work, because the problem of political indifference is also rampant in criticism work.
    The "Culture and Life Newspaper" once criticized the remarks of some of our critics. Several monographs were written specifically to criticize literary theorists Aichenbaum, Korneli Zheleninsky, and Rozintali. In the critical works of these people, there are elements of formalism and pedantry. Their articles are often divorced from life and from the actual needs of socialist construction. In the past, in the editorial department of "Soviet Art," lack of principles had taken root deeply. In some central newspapers, some chaotic and incorrect critical articles and reviews have been published more than once.
    In the republic, provincial, and local newspapers, the ideological level of critical articles and reviews is not high. Many newspapers simply do not have such articles.
    The criticism and book review department should be the Party-minded and combat department of the newspaper—in this department, the propaganda of Marxist-Leninist ideas is realized through the principled analysis of literary and artistic works.
    The tasks of our criticism and book reviews are completely different from those of the bourgeois press. Major newspapers in the United States have special supplements, often once a week. The content of the supplements is to review even if not all, most of the books published every day. The papers and reviews in it are usually flattering. This shows that criticism has become a commercial advertisement. It is an attachment to a list of business intelligence. The reader understands this, so he does not trust this kind of criticism. American readers read newspapers, but they do not respect newspapers, and even most readers do not understand that newspapers can be respected. And the newspapers in capitalist countries do not require people to respect themselves either. It is unprincipled itself, and at the same time it educates readers to be unprincipled.
    But the problem is completely different here. Soviet readers respect their newspapers. They often criticize its shortcomings, because they have sufficient reasons to make strict demands on the newspapers. Our publications have never known what advertising is. If our newspapers sometimes publish reports on newly published books, then readers even regard this simple report as a kind of recommendation. They have this view: if the book is bad, the newspaper will not introduce it.
    That is to say, in Soviet newspapers and in Soviet magazines, book reviews are no less significant than criticism.
    Choosing books to review is a very serious task. In terms of the pages of our newspapers, it is currently not possible to explain all the Soviet books published every day, and we cannot even list all the book titles in the "New Books" column. In the explanation, we briefly use five to ten lines to note the content of a book.
    Therefore, what should be reviewed and even explained are those books that have principal significance, are of interest to the vast number of readers, and have the possibility of raising principled questions, and it does not matter whether the book is large or small, whether it is literary or social economic, natural science, or technical. And those books, pamphlets, and articles that contain something new and unique or contain principal errors, departing from Marxism-Leninism and the Party's line, must be reviewed.
    The editor-in-chief should know all the books and publications published every day and know the publication plans. The plans themselves are the object of critical review. The central newspapers should not only be limited to critically analyzing individual works, but also systematically review literature, science, and art in various departments. Local newspapers should pay attention to the products of the publishing houses of various republics and provinces, and pay attention to the books of local academies of sciences and universities.
    The form of critical articles is diverse, and the style is also diverse. Critical sketches and lengthy propaganda and critical articles have the right to exist equally. Some sharp short comments with the title "Recent Mail" are no less significant than lengthy papers.
    Any department of the newspaper cannot accomplish its tasks by its own strength alone. It should have activists. The more activists there are, the closer the connection with life and with the actual needs of socialist construction is.
    For the criticism and book review department, a large number of and functioning activists are the first condition for the department's vitality. The staff of the department, even if they have three heads and six arms, cannot take care of all the books published every day. All departments of the newspaper should participate in the work of the criticism and book review department within their professional scope. In addition, the criticism and book review department should have literary and knowledge consultants and authors from various aspects outside the editorial department. The criticism department should be familiar with the literary and scientific discussions being held, the discussions of graduation theses, and various conferences and congresses.
    The editorial board of "Pravda" once passed such a resolution:
    "The editorial board of 'Pravda' especially pointed out that criticism and book reviews are a weapon of communist education and have great significance in forming the worldview of Soviet people. Correct criticism and book reviews, timely reporting on the books published every day by readers and their content, giving critical analysis to those works with low ideological level, anti-artistic or alienated from the spirit and ideology of the Soviet people, should be helpful in promoting Marxism-Leninism, political and scientific knowledge.
    "The editorial board especially pointed out that this work has been weakened in the pages of 'Pravda' in recent times. The Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)'s resolution of September 26, 1940, 'On Literary Criticism and Book Reviews' has not been implemented satisfactorily. The editorial board believes that it is necessary to correct this situation in the shortest possible period, and therefore decided:
    "1. In addition to the already launched reviews of individual books and book reviews, the editorial department should also systematically publish reviews of political and literary books, scientific and knowledge books in various departments, and reviews of criticism and book reviews and new book recommendations in various newspapers and magazines.
    "2. Considering the special multi-faceted nature of this work and the need to authoritatively criticize books on various issues, the editorial board believes that all departments of the editorial department should regularly and most actively participate in the work of the criticism and book review department.
    "The editorial board instructed all editors and directors of the departments to regularly pay attention to the books published every day within the scope of their own issues, and to prepare and publish reviews and criticisms of published books with the strength of the staff of the department.
    "3. The criticism and book review department should ensure that the editorial departments are notified in a timely manner of the books published every day, and ensure that these books are delivered. The editors of the departments should jointly select the books that should be reviewed and reviewed with the editors of the criticism and book review department, and discuss the completed papers and reviews with the editors of the criticism and book review department. ,
    "4. As before, the literature and art department should study literary and artistic issues together with the criticism and book review department.
    "5. It is necessary not only to absorb the staff of 'Pravda' headquarters to do criticism and book review work, but also to absorb skilled authors outside the editorial department to do this work.
    "The criticism and book review department should regularly, at least once a month, submit the titles of the most important papers and reviews recently to the editorial board for consideration."
    The meeting of the editors-in-chief of the central newspapers convened by the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in March 1948 discussed the issue of criticism and book reviews. Suslov, the secretary of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), stipulated the tasks of criticism and book reviews in newspapers:
    "Under the conditions that the number of books published for Soviet readers is increasing every year and every month, and the number of our new book titles is in the tens of thousands, criticism and book reviews correctly guide Soviet readers to understand the new books published every day, which is of great significance. In order for our readers to be able to choose the books of a certain department that are beneficial to him, in order for him not to be at a loss in the face of a large number of books, he must rely on the help of criticism and book reviews.
    "The forms of criticism and book review materials may be diverse: reviews of certain works, bibliographies on certain issues, and reviews of books published within a certain period. Resolute methods should be adopted to promote criticism and book reviews, and to end the current situation in which this work is still accidental in nature.
    "Criticism and book reviews should implement the Bolshevik Party spirit, and be determined by the decisions of the Party Central Committee on ideological issues that everyone is familiar with, that is: the decisions on the magazines 'Star' and 'Leningrad', on theater performances, on the film 'The Great Life', and on the opera 'The Great Friendship'.
    "The Party spirit in criticism is first and foremost the ruthless exposure of the emergence of various methods of bourgeois views, political indifference, and lack of ideology. The meaning of the Party spirit in criticism is also to ensure a comrade-like attitude to analyze those Soviet works of ours that, although imbued with patriotic ideas, contain individual shortcomings. The task of criticism is not to make the author dizzy with slap-in-the-face criticism, but to help the author discover and correct shortcomings, thereby promoting the growth of the author's creation."
    It is necessary to end the situation as soon as possible, that is, the criticism and book review department seems not to be an indispensable part of the newspaper, and it can appear on the pages of the newspaper, or it can not appear for several weeks or months in a row. In the struggle against the factors of lack of ideology and political indifference, against "objectivism" in literature and science, against hypocritical "academism", and against the distortion of Marxism-Leninism, an important position belongs to criticism and book reviews as a serious weapon of Bolshevik propaganda.

　　报纸上的批评和图书评论
    查斯拉夫斯基
    编者按：本文所说《批评和图书评论》中的“批评”，特指文艺批评。又本文中“宣传”一词的含义，特指马克思列宁主义的宣传，相当于我国“理论教育”一词的含义。苏联省级以上报纸根据联共中央决议，一般均设有批评和图书评论部及宣传部。
    关于文学批评的意义，已在一九四六年八月十四日和二十六日以及九月四日联共（布）中央关于文学、艺术、电影等方面所犯的错误和缺点的各项决定中非常尖锐和特别有力地提出来了。
    在联共（布）中央关于《星》和《列宁格勒》两杂志的决议中，我们可以读到：
    “《星》和《列宁格勒》领导人的思想上的缺点，同时使得这些领导人和文学家的关系不是以正确的教育苏维埃人和在政治上指导文学家的活动这些利益为基础，而是以私人的利益，朋友的利益为基础。由于不愿破坏朋友关系，批评就迟钝了。由于害怕得罪朋友，完全无用的作品竟准许付印了。这是一种这样的自由主义，由于它，人民和国家的利益、正确教育我们的青年的利益，就成为朋友关系的牺牲品；由于它，批评就偃旗息鼓；这种自由主义的结果就是使作家不再长进，对人民、国家和党的责任感为之丧失，进步为之停止。”①
    在关于剧场上演节目的决议中写道：
    “剧场上演节目不能令人满意的状况，其原因还在于缺乏原则性的布尔什维克的戏剧批评。在苏联出版界只有极少数专家充任戏剧批评家。报纸、文艺杂志、戏剧杂志很少提拔善于客观而公正地分析剧本和戏剧艺术的新批评家。有些批评家在评价剧本和演出时，不是以苏联剧本创作和舞台艺术在思想和艺术方面发展的利益为指导，也就是说，不是以国家和人民的利益为指导，而是以小集团、朋友、个人的利益为指导。报纸所发表的许多评论演出的文章，往往是一些不懂艺术的人们所写的，在这些文章中，对于新的演出不是切切实实的分析，而是与演出的真正意义和水平不相称的、主观而任性的批评。对于剧本和演出的评介，往往是用一些没有意义的、为读者难于了解的语言写成的。《真理报》、《消息报》、《共青真理报》、《劳动报》对于戏剧演出的巨大教育意义估计不够，因而分出极小的篇幅给予艺术问题。”②
    在决议中特别提出一条：
    “承认批评在发展戏剧艺术中的重要作用，特责成《真理报》、《消息报》、《共青真理报》、《劳动报》、《苏联艺术报》、《文学报》编辑部吸收政治上成熟的、技术熟练的戏剧和文学批评家从事报纸工作，有系统的刊载评论新剧本和演出的文章，与戏剧批评的漠视政治和无思想性进行坚决的斗争。
    “责成各共和国、各边疆、各省报纸编辑部有系统地登载关于地方剧场新剧演出的文章和评介。”③
    这里指的是戏剧评介，然而以上所说也适用于文学批评，适用于科学批评。这不仅仅是相类似。任何戏剧评介，假定它同时不是文学评介的话，就不可能是令人满意的、对教育人民任务负责的评介。
    在我们报刊中，特别是在地方报刊中，普遍存在着一种评介方法，就是把自己的任务局限于主要的批评演员的演技上面。有些评介家看完戏以后，回来就给演员们划分数，分别给予他们以夸奖或者谴责。
    有些人觉得这种评介家是专家，他懂得戏剧艺术。被他夸奖的演员们非常满意，认为这个评介家是好的，非常懂得戏剧。而那些被他骂过的演员们则认为这是一个非常无知的糟糕的批评家。
    这种分别予以恭维和辱骂的评介方式，无论在戏剧的、在文学的、在任何一般的批评上都是要不得的。
    戏剧评介家首先应当暴露戏剧的思想内容，舞台形象的社会性；他们应当指出某一戏剧中什么是好的，这个戏剧在哪一点有助于教育我们的人民，或者相反，指出它在哪一点是有害的，不正确的表现了苏维埃人，歪曲了苏维埃人的形象。为了要写这种评介，首先自己要掌握马克思列宁主义的理论武器，要能够批评地分析舞台即讲坛所提供给我们的材料。
    当然，批评演员的表演和导演的技巧也是必要的，但批评的任务不是这样就算完事。最重要的是分析此一或彼一艺术形象的思想和政治的因素。揭露艺术形象的社会政治内容是文艺批评论文和评介的首要任务。然而这并不是说作者不能批评艺术的形式。
    关于影片《伟大的生活》的决议揭破了某些作者和导演的无知。这些作者和导演暴露了自己不认识苏联生活，描绘了一幅顿巴斯的歪曲图景。还有一些导演在描写纳赫莫夫、描写伊凡雷帝的影片中歪曲了俄罗斯历史。但这方面的过错，不仅是编剧者和演出者的。同时不正确地夸奖著作、剧本、影片的批评家们对于脚本、影片的错误也应当分担一半责任。
    联共（布）中央关于思想教育战线上的缺点和错误的历次决议的重要性是极其显明的。这对于我们在文学、艺术、科学各方面的批评工作是战斗的纲领。
    党不止一次唤起苏联的舆论和苏联的报刊注意党性批评的任务。
    让我们来回忆一个有关批评和图书评论的最重要的文件——联共（布）中央在一九四○年的决议。在这决议中指出：
    “作为宣传和共产主义教育严重武器的文学批评和图书评论现在处于极端混乱的状态。
    “在大多数的报纸杂志上，文艺批评的材料近来几乎绝迹了。在提高大众的政治和文化技术水平上有重大意义的推广性的图书评论工作不能令人满意。直到现在，书目参考、给各门科学读者的推荐书目、各种职业的参考书索引，都还没有完成。
    批评和图书评论工作脱离了社会主义建设的实际需要。”
    中央指出：“……文艺批评是目前最弱的一环。大多数的批评家不去研究苏联文学的各种问题，对于它的成长不去给以影响。与俄罗斯文学传统背道而驰，批评家们不愿做能够团结作家的杂志编辑工作，而把自己关闭在作家协会批评部这个孤立的团体中。”
    中央进而订出一系列的根本改进文学批评和图书评论的措施。文艺杂志编辑部应设立经常性的批评和图书评论部。《真理报》、《消息报》、《共青真理报》、《劳动报》、《红星报》、所有共和国的、边疆的、省的报纸、以及科学和生产部门中的报纸和杂志编辑部应当在自己的篇幅上组织批评和图书评论。
    一般政治性的中央报纸和杂志的批评和图书评论部，除了对于个别著作的评介和图书短评外，还应当有系统地评述各种科学和知识的书刊。理论的和一般政治的中央杂志编辑部应当一面刊载文学批评的文章和对于最急需的图书的评介，一面还应当对于为读者瞩望最殷的书籍组织图书评论和述评。各共和国的、边疆的、省的报纸应当有系统地刊载推荐书目和关于最重要文学作品的文章，而且同时要保证评述地方出版的一切书刊。生产部门的报纸和杂志应当组织经常性的批评和图书评论部，有系统地评述一切每天出版的专门书籍。每一生产部门书刊评述的刊载，每季不得少于一次。
    对于决议中所说文学批评和图书评论是宣传和共产主义教育的严重武器这句话，应当特别注意。
    在我们的报纸的实际工作中，可以遇见这样的看法，认为报纸的宣传部才以宣传为主要任务，而其他一切材料仿佛就不是宣传似的。
    当然，这是不正确的。报纸和杂志所有各部都发生宣传作用。新闻报道并不见得比论文算是较差的严重的宣传武器。然而实际上人们往往认为只有论文，而且只有具备一定的性质、一定的风格、一定的体裁的论文才算是宣传品。
    为了反对这种简单的看法，联共（布）中央直截了当的指出，批评的文章和评介是严重的宣传武器。
    有了批评和图书评论部，同时并不妨碍其他各部，特别是宣传部，参与文学和科学的批评。报纸和杂志的各部都应当注意其专业范围内的书刊。所有苏联报刊工作人员都应当懂得书，读书，爱书。一般说来，所有各部的领导者都是同意这一点的，但通常总是推辞说他们忙于业务问题，没有时间阅读和批评书刊。因此，不论是评述其专业范围内的书刊，不论是评介个别的书籍，都没有放进自己的计划里面去。然而要知道，批评和图书评论工作如果不成为所有各部的职责的话，那是不可能做得好的。批评和图书评论部不仅应当准备登载自己份内的材料，而且要站在批评和图书评论是宣传和共产主义教育的严重武器这一立场上，去号召报纸或者杂志所有各部共同来做批评工作。因为它是非常强有力的武器。
    评介书刊能够提供出极鲜明、极富于表现力的材料。这不仅是完全合乎规律，而且是布尔什维克宣传的传统方法。许多文艺作品正因为它们富有鲜明的形象，所以对于马克思列宁主义的宣传，对于我党政策的基本思想的宣传，才能提供出令人满意的材料。譬如奥斯特洛夫斯基所著《钢铁是怎样炼成的》一书中保尔·柯察金的形象，法捷耶夫的《青年近卫军》中红色顿河青年们的形象，都有巨大的宣传意义。
    中央指示批评和图书评论工作应密切的结合社会主义建设的实际需要，对于这点要特别注意。
    近来我们的报刊存在着一种对于文学批评问题和社会主义建设问题之间的机械的划分法。关于经济建设性质书刊的评介偶然登载一两次。报纸的工业部和农业部主编没有把有系统地评述每天出版的专门书刊作为自己的任务，而文学批评往往离开社会主义的实际来看文艺作品。
    中央的决议责成中央的、共和国的、省的报刊在自己的篇幅上组织批评和图书评论。就是说，登载批评的文章不许带有断片、偶然的性质。这个工作必须是经常的。编辑应当知道文学界发生些什么事情。每天都要注意它。只要两三个月不这样做，那么便留下了一个不易补充的空白。编辑应当清楚出版的情况。
    中央各报纸应当经常评述各个部门的科学和知识的书刊。
    各共和国的、边疆的、省的报纸必需有规律地发表推荐书目，评介地方出版的书刊。中央各报纸不容易管照各地的出版工作，特别不容易管照苏联各民族的各种文字的书籍。而这些书里面往往有不少的错误。当然，中央报刊应当照管这方面的书刊。它遍设通讯网就是为了这些。但共和国的、省的、地方的报刊应当负起更大的责任。它不能说报社的工作是出版报纸，而地方出版工作是出版书籍。报纸编辑部应当细心留意省内所出版的书刊。但我们各共和国和省的报刊完全谈不上已经胜任这一任务。各地的报纸几乎没有反应地方出版工作的活动。
    在乌克兰、格鲁吉亚、阿捷尔拜疆及其他共和国的出版工作中，在文艺作品中发现了一系列的民族主义曲解和倾向。而且不仅是在文艺作品中。例如白俄罗斯《白俄罗斯历史出版社》出版了一本当地历史家的著作。这本书犯了一些极大的错误。
    我们出版界的文学批评是有缺点的，带有偶然性质的。此外，它的水平也是不高的。往往简直是一些无知的批评。
    安德列耶夫在一九三六年一月谈到对于儿童文学批评的要求。他的话不仅适用于儿童文学。他说：
    “为了儿童文学的顺利成长，同时也是为了一般文学的顺利成长，还需要什么呢？批评！不是那种无知的批评，它往往不辨问题的实质，为了一点笔误、为了一两句不成功的造句，就把一个青年作家打击得垂头丧气。我们的文学批评家们——遗憾得很，现在批评家还很少，常常不去锐敏而细心的批评此一或彼一作品的优点和缺点，而简单地要么就是笼统的褒奖，要么就是笼统的贬责。这种批评不是我们所需要的。我们需要锐敏的、原则性的批评，它能揭露此一或彼一作品的真正的缺点，同时能把文学中一切腐烂的东西、一切异己的和不健康的东西清洗干净，来教导作家，鼓励他的成长、他的前进。我们的文学界中有这样的批评吗？没有，这种批评的形成还早着呢。我们的出版机关、报纸、杂志对这件最重要的事情注意得极端不够，连作家们本身在自己行列里文学的自我批评也开展得很薄弱。”
    这是在一九三六年说的话，但这些指示在今天还没有失掉它的意义。在我们的报刊里，尤其是在地方报刊里，遗憾得很，可以找到笼统褒奖或者笼统贬责的例子，可以找到无知的、不诚恳的、玩弄词句像玩弄小棍儿似的批评的例子。
    一九四○年党中央关于批评和图书评论的决议发表以后，这个工作在我们报刊中大大活跃起来。战争曾在某种程度上阻止了它。书籍出版的数量减少了。报纸的篇幅缩小了。当然，这并不是说，任何批评和图书评论工作都停止了。每个人都记得，在战时这个工作也在进行，而且正是联系着国防的实际任务进行的。我们可以拿柯尔涅楚克的剧本《前线》作例子，——它是在《真理报》上登载的，同时《真理报》为它撰述了使人能够了解剧中要点的长篇批评文章。
    党在战时也给予批评和图书评论工作以严重的意义。
    苏联文学和科学批评有非常丰富的、可以大胆的说任何其他的民族文学中没有的传统。关于这些传统，日丹诺夫在关于《星》和《列宁格勒》杂志的报告中曾说：
    “马克思主义的文学批评，即柏林斯基、车尔尼雪夫斯基、杜布罗留勃夫伟大传统的继承者，始终是现实主义的、有一定社会目的的艺术的保护者。为了揭露那种对于文学和艺术的唯心论的和反科学的观念，为了保卫我们俄国伟大的、曾教导我们把文学当作为人民服务的强有力的手段看待的革命民主派的基本原理，普列汉诺夫在这方面做了很多工作。”④
    又说：“因此，苏联文学的优良传统是十九世纪俄国文学优良传统的继续，是我们伟大革命民主派柏林斯基、杜布罗留勃夫、车尔尼雪夫斯基、萨尔蒂科夫一谢德林所创造的、普列汉诺夫所继续的，以及列宁和斯大林用科学的方法加以整理和最后奠定了基础的传统的继续。”⑤
    俄国伟大马列主义先驱者的功绩就在于他们与反动势力、与无思想性和漠视政治进行了热情的、党性的斗争，就在于他们在政治上对于民主的基本原理、在文学中对于现实主义进行了原则性的保卫工作。
    他们所用的方法，主要的是批判地分析文学作品的方法。这是一种政治宣传，一种在内容上极有力的、但主要是用文学的材料构成的政治宣传。柏林斯基曾写了许多长篇的文学批评论文，但他也写过许多有的甚至不满六十至一百行的评介各种书籍的短文。他仿佛不过是一个文学批评家，因此在一定的时期，他竟经得住尼古拉的宪兵检查制度，而实际上读者在他的作品中却发现了十九世纪初叶前进思想的宣传。
    在我们的报刊中常常引证柏林斯基的一句绝好的预言。他在一八四○年写道：“我们羡慕我们的子孙能够看见一九四○年的俄罗斯——那时的俄罗斯是站在有教养的世界的首位，给予科学和艺术以规律，而且接受全体有教养人类的尊崇献礼……”
    这几句话充满了深刻的历史意义。而这几句话是为一八四○年日历的出版在一篇图书短评里写成的。柏林斯基的作品有很多这类的评介——在不大的篇幅中包含着极大的哲学的和历史的思想。
    这是一个作为严重宣传武器的图书评论的出色例子。一本日历，一本普通的一八四○年的日历，柏林斯基一下就抓住了它。换一个评介家会写成这样子：出版了一本什么书，多少页，印的如何，内容如何。他也许加上一点说：这本书是有益的，值得注意。这样的评介在政治宣传中是起不了大作用的。而柏林斯基则从另一观点出发，他认为日历是反映一年的事件的，它是俄罗斯人民发展的历史过程的路标，所以他善于写出我们现在每一读到就带着激动心情的天才预言。这个批评家的眼光多么锐敏，在黑暗中，在尼古拉时代的监狱中竟能预见我们的一九四○年！
    我们回忆一下柏林斯基另外一个作品——他那有名的、列宁称之为最优秀的民主主义文献之一的给果戈理的信。仅仅为了读过这封信，沙皇政府竟判决妥斯托也夫斯基以死刑，后来以苦役代替了死刑。在柏林斯基给果戈理的这封信中，表现着火焰般的革命热情。然而这封信是论什么的呢？是论果戈理的文学作品，是论他的《与友人通信摘录》。
      杜布罗留勃夫的出色论文《黑暗王国中的一线光明》是论述奥斯特洛夫斯基的戏剧《大雷雨》的。而与杜布罗留勃夫同时代的青年则把这篇文学批评论文看作一种革命民主主义的纲领。
    车尔尼雪夫斯基和皮萨了夫的文学批评和科学批评论文也是属于这类东西的。
    所有这些批评的文章都充满着社会的内容。它们是一种政论式的批评，就是说，这种批评不仅是分析作品在艺术上的优点和缺点，而且是揭露这些作品的社会内容，分析艺术形象的性格，用这些来发展和宣传一定的政治思想。
    或者有人会说，这些伟大的批评家们，革命民主主义者们，限于检查的条件不得不这样做，因为沙皇的检查制度不容许直接宣传革命民主思想。当然，柏林斯基如果生在我们的时代，首先会是一个杰出的政治评论家。他会不仅是一个文学批评家。我们时代的政论家已经无须用文学批评来掩护自己以便发挥和宣传政治思想了。我们是直截了当的来做这事的。但是仍不能只用检查的条件来解释所以选择这种文学体裁的原因。问题不仅在于此。
    文艺作品本身就是非常重要的提高认识的材料。它们反映生活。它们是传布重要社会思想的泉源。
    列宁论托尔斯泰的一些经典的天才论文就包含着农民革命性质的最重要的原理。列宁把托尔斯泰的作品看作“俄国革命的镜子”。这是用艺术材料写成的卓绝的政论的范例，这同时是马克思主义党性文学批评的模范，而且这样批评的技巧也是我们所有作家应当学习的。
    列宁教导我们的作家学习党性的批评。一九○八年二月七日他在给高尔基的信中写道：“噢哟，在各式各样半党的和党外的杂志连篇累牍的长而又长的文学批评论文里面，一点要得的东西都没有！我们最好离开这种知识分子的陈旧的、老爷式的作风远一点儿，就是说，我们要把文学批评与党的工作、与党的领导更密切地结合起来。欧洲的成熟的社会民主党就是这样做的。”
    政论批评的传统就是这样的。这些传统直到今天仍保持着全部的生命。文学批评不应当脱离生活，脱离斗争。它应当是党性的批评，这也就是说，它应当与社会主义建设的实际需要紧密地结合着。
    然而我们的报刊的批评工作存在着本质的缺点。联共（布）中央对于文艺、戏剧、电影所发出的指示完全适用于批评工作。批评对于文学和艺术、以及科学著作的缺点和错误特别要有责任感。批评应当及时指出并分析犯错误的作品。它常常不做这个工作，因为漠视政治的毛病也在批评工作上作祟。
    《文化和生活报》曾经批评我们某些批评家的言论。有几篇专论是特为批评文学理论家艾汗堡姆、柯尔涅里耶·节灵斯基、罗津塔里而写的。在这几个人的批评作品中有着形式主义、烦琐哲学的成分。他们的文章常常脱离生活，脱离社会主义建设的实际需要。在过去“苏联艺术”编辑部里，无原则性已经根深蒂固。在一些中央报纸上，不止一次地登载一些混乱的、不正确的批评文章和评介。
    在共和国的、省的、地方的报刊里，批评文章和评介的思想水平并不高。许多报纸上这样的文章根本就没有。
    批评和图书评论部应当是报纸的党性的、战斗的部，——在这一部里，马克思列宁主义思想的宣传是通过文艺作品的原则性的分析而实现的。
    我们的批评和图书评论的任务和资产阶级报刊的完全两样。美国各大报都有专门的增刊，常常是一星期一次。增刊的内容就是评述那即使不是全部也是大部分的每天出版的书刊。其中的论文和评介照例是捧场的。这说明批评变成了商业性质的广告。它是一种商情一览的附件。读者是懂得这个的，因此对这种批评是不信任的。美国的读者读报纸，但是对报纸不尊重，甚至大多数读者不了解报纸是可以被尊重的。而且资本主义国家的报纸也不要求人家尊重自己。它自己无原则性，同时也教育读者无原则性。
    而问题在我们这里就完全不同。苏联读者尊重自己的报纸。他们常常批评它的缺点，因为他们有充分的理由向报纸提出严格的要求。我们的出版物从来不知什么是广告。如果我们的报纸有时登载关于刚出版的新书报道，那么读者甚至对于这简单的报道也看作是一种推荐。他们有这样的看法：如果书是坏的话，报纸不会介绍它的。
    这就是说，在苏联报纸上、在苏联杂志上，图书评论并不比批评的意义更小一些。
    选择书籍来做评介是一件非常严重的任务。就我们报纸的篇幅来说，目前还没有可能把一切每天出版的苏联书籍都做出说明来，我们甚至不能在“新书”栏里把书名列举完。在说明里，我们简短地用五行至十行的地位注出一本书的内容。
    因此，所评介和甚至所说明的应当是那些具有原则意义的、为广大的读者感觉兴趣的、有可能提出原则性问题的书籍，致于书是大的还是小的，是文艺的还是社会经济的、自然科学的、技术的，都没有关系。而那些含有某种新的特有的独创的东西的或者含有原则性的错误的，离开马列主义和党的路线的书籍、小册子、文章，一定要加以评介。
    主编应当知道一切每天出版的书刊、知道出版计划。这些计划的本身就是批评审查的对象。中央各报纸不应当仅限于批评分析个别的作品，同时要有系统地评述各种部门的文学、科学、艺术。地方报纸应当注意各共和国的、各省的出版机关的生产品，注意当地科学院和大学的书刊。
    批评论文的形式是多样性的，体裁也是多样性的。批评性的小品文和长篇大论的宣传、批评论文同样有存在的权利。以《最近来邮》为题的某些尖锐的短评，其意义并不亚于长篇论文。
    报纸的任何一部只靠本身力量是不能胜任它的任务的。它应当有积极分子。积极分子越多，与生活、与社会主义建设的实际需要的联系也就越紧密。
    对于批评和图书评论部，众多的而且能发生作用的积极分子是该部生命力的第一个条件。该部的工作人员，即使他们有三头六臂，也照管不了一切每天出版的书籍。报纸的各部都应当在其专业范围内参加批评和图书评论部的工作。此外，批评和图书评论部应当有编辑部以外的各个方面的文学和知识的顾问、作者。批评部应当熟悉正在举行的文学和科学讨论会、毕业论文的讨论、各种会议和代表大会。
    《真理报》编辑委员会曾经通过这样的决议：
    “《真理报》编辑委员会特别指出批评和图书评论是共产主义教育的武器，在形成苏维埃人的世界观上有巨大的意义。正确的批评和图书评论，及时报道读者每天出版的书籍及其内容，对于那些思想水平低的、反艺术的或者与苏联人民的精神、苏联的意识形态绝缘的作品予以批判性的分析，对于宣传马克思列宁主义，政治和科学的知识，应当是有帮助的。
    “编辑委员会特别指出，最近时期这个工作在《真理报》的篇幅上削弱起来。一九四○年九月二十六日联共（布）中央《关于文学批评和图书评论》的决议执行得不能令人满意。编辑委员会认为必须在最短期间改正这个状况，为此特决议：
    “一、除了已经展开的对个别书籍的评论和图书短评以外，编辑部还应当有系统地发表政治和文艺书刊、各部门的科学和知识书刊的述评，以及各报纸和杂志的批评和图书评论及新书推荐的述评。
    “二、由于考虑到这个工作的特别多方面性和必须权威地批评各种问题的书刊，编辑委员会认为编辑部各部都应当经常而且最积极的参加批评和图书评论部的工作。
    “编辑委员会责成各部全体编辑人员和各部主任经常注意他们本身问题范围内的每天出版的书刊，并用本部工作人员的力量准备发表已出版书籍的评介和批评。
    “三、批评和图书评论部应当保证及时通知编辑部各部每天出版的书籍，并且保证送到这些书籍。各部的编辑人员应与批评和图书评论部的编辑人员共同选择应当评介和评述的书籍，并与批评和图书评论部的编辑商讨已写好的论文和述评。，
    “四、仍像从前一样，文学和艺术部应与批评和图书评论部共同研究文艺问题。
    “五、必须不仅吸收《真理报》本部的工作人员来做批评和图书评论工作，而且要吸收编辑部以外的熟练的作者来做这个工作。
    “批评和图书评论部应当经常地，一月至少一次，把最近最重要的论文和述评的题目呈送编辑委员会审定。”
    一九四八年三月在联共（布）党中央宣传鼓动部召开的中央报纸主编会议曾讨论到批评和图书评论问题。联共（布）党中央书记苏斯洛夫曾这样规定报纸上的批评和图书评论的任务：
    “在为苏联读者出版的书籍数量每年每月地增加、我们的新书名目以数万计的条件下，批评和图书评论正确地指导苏联读者认识每天出版的新书，是有巨大的意义的。为了我们的读者能够选择对他有益的一定部门的书籍，为了他不致在大量的书籍面前茫然失措，他就要依靠批评和图书评论的帮助。
    “批评和图书评论材料的形式可能是多样的：对于一定作品的评介，某一问题的参考书目，一定时期内所出版的书刊述评。要采取坚决的方法提倡批评和图书评论，并结束目前这种工作还带有偶然的性质这一情况。
    “批评和图书评论应当贯彻布尔什维克的党性，并被大家所熟悉的党中央在意识形态问题上的决定所确定，这些决定就是：关于《星》和《列宁格勒》杂志的、关于戏剧上演节目的、关于影片《伟大的生活》的、关于歌剧《伟大的友谊》的各项决定。
    “批评中的党性首先就是无情地暴露资产阶级观点、漠视政治、无思想性的各种方法的出现。批评中的党性的意思同时也是保证用同志般的态度分析那些虽然贯彻着爱国主义思想、可是含有个别缺点的我们的苏维埃的作品。批评的任务不是用打耳光式的批评使作者晕头转向，而是帮助作者发现和改正缺点，从而促使作者创作的成长。”
    要尽快结束这种情况，即批评和图书评论部仿佛不是报纸的不可缺少的一部，在报纸上的篇页上可以出现，也可以一连数星期数月不出现。在反对无思想性和漠视政治的因素、反对文学和科学中的“客观主义”、反对虚伪的“学院派”、反对曲解马列主义的斗争中，重要的地位是属于作为布尔什维克宣传的严重武器的批评和图书评论的。
