　　US Second Division Suffers Heavy Losses
    Division Commander McClure Removed

    Xinhua News Agency, London, January 15th: Despite Tokyo's strict censorship, news has leaked out that the US Second Division has lost more than half its strength and that MacArthur has telegraphed Washington that "the Second Division can no longer fight." Other reports say that many units of the Second Division have lost contact with each other, and the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers have already broken into their positions. At a time when the Second Division is in serious crisis, the sudden removal of its commander, McClure (who once served as Deputy Chief of Staff to the bandit Chiang Kai-shek), is seen here as sufficient to demonstrate the miserable situation of the US military and its command.

    Another dispatch: A spokesman for the US invading army's Eighth Corps announced that Leffner, former Chief of Staff of the Tenth Corps, will succeed McClure as commander of the US Second Division. McClure commanded the US invading army's Second Division for only six weeks.

　　美军第二师损失惨重
    师长麦克鲁已被撤换
    【新华社十六日讯】据电通社伦敦十五日讯：尽管东京实施严格的新闻检查，美军第二师实力已损失过半和麦克阿瑟电告华盛顿“第二师不能再战”的消息，仍然传出来了。其他的消息说：第二师的许多单位已彼此失去了联系，朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿部队业已攻入他们的阵地。正当第二师处在严重危急的关头的时候，该师师长麦克鲁（曾任匪首蒋介石的副参谋长）的突然被撤职，此间认为足以表明美军及其指挥部所处的悲惨状况。
    另讯：美国侵略军第八军发言人宣布：继任麦克鲁为美军第二师师长的是前第十兵团参谋长勒夫纳。麦克鲁统率美侵略军第二师为时仅六个星期。
