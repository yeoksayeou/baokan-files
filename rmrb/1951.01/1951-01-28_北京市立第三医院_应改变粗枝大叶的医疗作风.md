　　Beijing Municipal Third Hospital
    Should Change Its Careless Medical Style
To the Editor:
    I am a worker at the South Converter Plant of the Beijing Electric Tram Company, and I have some opinions regarding the medical work of the Municipal Third Hospital.
    On November 19th of last year (Sunday) at 4:00 PM, a fellow worker from our plant, Comrade Sun Zhikui, unfortunately fell onto a clay pot, cutting his upper thigh. At the time, his fellow workers immediately sent him to the Third Hospital for treatment. When the doctor on duty performed the surgery, the fellow workers explained that there were fragments of tile inside the wound and suggested a careful examination. Not only did the doctor not accept this advice, but he disregarded it and hastily stitched up the wound. Later, during a follow-up visit, it was observed that the upper part of the wound had split open, but the doctor still carelessly applied adhesive tape. Because of work, Sun Zhikui did not return to the hospital and changed the gauze himself every day. After a few days, the lower part of the wound showed signs of suppuration. On December 30th, a piece of pot shard was removed from the suppurating area of the wound, and another piece was removed on January 7th. Both pieces were triangular in shape, each side being half an inch long. On January 12th, yet another piece was removed. After removal, muscle tissue began to grow in the wound. However, small blisters appeared around the wound, and after the blisters broke, they discharged fluid, forming sores that spread to an area the size of a teapot lid. Small red bumps also appeared on the lower abdomen and upper thigh, causing severe itching. This fellow worker is currently receiving treatment at the Central People's Hospital.
    We are very dissatisfied with the Third Hospital's negligent and careless medical style. This not only fails to alleviate the patient's suffering but increases their pain and affects their work. We workers sincerely hope that the hospital will conduct a serious self-examination, cultivate a responsible work ethic towards patients, serve the people, and improve the people's hospital.
          Worker of the South Converter Plant of the Beijing Electric Tram Company, Qu Qingzhong

### 北京市立第三医院  应改变粗枝大叶的医疗作风

　　北京市立第三医院
    应改变粗枝大叶的医疗作风编辑同志：
    我是北京市电车公司南变流厂的工人，我对市立第三医院的医疗工作有点意见。
    我厂工友孙志魁同志在去年十一月十九日（星期日）下午四时不慎跌倒在瓦盆上，大腿上部伤了一道口子。当时，工友们马上把他送到第三医院诊治。该院值班大夫作手术时，工友们说明肉内有瓦片，建议仔细诊看一下。该大夫不但不接受意见反而置之不理，草率地在伤口上缝了几针。后来复诊时见伤口上部破裂，大夫仍是不关心地用粘膏贴上。孙志魁因工作关系没有再去医院，每日自己换纱布。几天后伤口下部有化脓现象，到十二月三十日在伤口化脓处取出一块盆杖，一月七日又取出一块，前后两块都为三角形每边长有三分半。至一月十二日复又取出一块来，取出后，伤口即生肌肉。但是在伤口四周发生了小水泡，水泡破后流水成疮，漫延面积有茶壶口大小，并在小肚子及大腿上部生有小红疙疸，刺痒异常。现该工友正在中央人民医院诊治中。
    我们对第三医院这种疏忽粗糙的医疗作风，是很不满意的。这不仅不能使病人减去痛苦，反而增多了苦楚并影响了工作。我们工人们很希望该院认真的进行检讨，培养对病人负责的工作精神，为人民服务，把人民的医院搞好。
