Responding to the Motherland's Call to Strengthen National Defense Construction
    250,000 Young People Sign Up to Attend Military Academies
    Those Admitted Have Gathered and Enrolled, Happily Studying
    [Reported by this newspaper] The vast number of young students and young workers in China are enthusiastically responding to the call of the motherland, actively participating in national defense construction, and setting off a new upsurge of patriotism. According to available statistics, from December 10th of last year to January 10th of this year, within one month, the number of young students and young workers who volunteered to apply to various military cadre schools has reached more than 250,000. In Shanghai alone, the number of students applying to military cadre schools reached 20,000, and the number of workers reached approximately 5,000. The young people participating in this movement, including those involved in publicity, mobilization, and farewell activities, are estimated to reach about one million in the student sector alone. Currently, young people admitted from various regions (excluding some areas in the Southwest and Northwest) have gathered and entered various military cadre schools for joyful study.

    The movement of young students and workers participating in military cadre schools is being carried out in close conjunction with patriotic ideological education. The general characteristics are that the publicity and preparation time is relatively long, while the formal application time lasts only one or two days. During the publicity and mobilization phase, many schools discussed how to inherit and promote the glorious patriotic traditions of Chinese youth through city-wide commemorative meetings held to commemorate "December 1st" and "December 9th," or through scattered small-scale forums, evening parties, and bonfire parties. Some places held youth representative conferences, youth get-together conferences, and student representative conferences to conduct ideological mobilization. Other places combined regular courses with current affairs education and patriotic education. Cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Wuxi also organized reports introducing the life of the navy and air force, allowing students to further understand and love the People's Army. Factories also held employee meetings and young worker meetings to organize denunciation meetings, etc. As a result of extensive and in-depth ideological education, on the one hand, the ideological concerns of some young people were dispelled, allowing them to realize that moving from ordinary study positions to military science and technology study positions, and from production and construction positions to national defense construction positions, are all for the sake of defending the motherland, and that defending the motherland also means defending their own loved ones and their own careers. On the other hand, it also universally improved the political consciousness of young people staying at schools and factories. During the application and review phases, the local enrollment committees and referral committees earnestly and realistically considered the physical and political conditions of the applicants, taking into account the needs of other construction and work, as well as specific difficulties, and carefully reviewed and approved the applications. Many students said with emotion: "Chairman Mao cares about us so much." The grand farewell ceremonies held in various places for young students and workers participating in military cadre schools as they embarked on glorious posts were filled with rich and vivid patriotic education content. When the congratulatory team sent a banner of "Glorious Family" to the more than sixty-year-old grandmother of Lu Ronglin, a student from Shanghai Zhaoguang Middle School who joined the military academy, she smiled broadly and repeatedly said: "This is the glory brought by Chairman Mao!" Workers from Qingdao who joined the military academy, carrying gifts from the factory, rode in decorated vehicles and were cheered on their way by a huge farewell team. Li Hongshan, a worker who was being sent off, was extremely moved. He recalled that before liberation, when his comrades joined the revolution, they secretly left with a small cotton-padded jacket. He said: "If the people of the whole country had not stood up, there would not be such great glory!"

    This movement has gained widespread sympathy from society and has promoted the patriotic movement in all walks of life. Many patriotic parents have emerged during the movement. For example, the Hui ethnic group's Old Lady Shan already has eight children participating in revolutionary work, and now she is sending her ninth child to military cadre school. Wu Yun-chu, general manager of Shanghai Tianchu MSG Factory, personally sent his only daughter, Wu Zhilian, to military academy and broadcast on Shanghai People's Radio, encouraging the parents of young people participating in military cadre schools, saying: "Congratulations, congratulations! You have good children!" Glorious parents regard sending their children to participate in national defense construction as a responsibility they owe to the motherland. The sense of glory in defending the motherland has become a common social psychology. When four employees of the Qingdao Waterworks entered military cadre school, they wore red ribbons and flowers, rode on tall horses, and the audience along the way applauded and cheered for them like heroes, praising and respecting them.

    Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members in schools and factories played a significant role in promoting this movement. More than 50% of the students and workers participating in the military academy are Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members. Their exemplary role influenced the vast number of young people and expanded the political influence of the Party and the League.

    Currently, young people from most parts of the country have been concentrated in different areas and have entered various military cadre schools. Military cadre schools in Northeast China, North China, and East China warmly welcome newly enrolled young people. Upon enrollment, the most urgent desire of each student and worker is to receive a military uniform. When they put on their new yellow, green, or blue military uniforms and wore the five-star "August 1st" cap badge, they all cheered: "We are the People's Liberation Army!" Some crowded around to look in the mirror, some immediately wanted to take a picture to send to their mothers and classmates, some shouted excitedly: "We will advance under the August 1st banner!" Some said: "We will not only put on military uniforms on the outside, but also wear military uniforms in our minds!"

　　响应祖国号召加强国防建设
    廿五万青年报名参加军校
    被录取者已分别集合入学愉快学习
    【本报讯】中国广大青年学生、青年工人热烈响应祖国召唤，踊跃参加国防建设，掀起爱国主义新高潮。根据现有材料统计，自去年十二月十日至今年一月十日一个月内，志愿报名参加各种军事干部学校的青年学生、青年工人，已达二十五万余人，仅上海一地，报名参加军事干部学校的学生即达两万人，工人约五千余人。参加这个运动的青年，包括参加宣传、动员、欢送等过程的，只学生方面，估计即达一百万人左右。现各地（除西南、西北部分地区）被录取的青年，已分别集合进入各种军事干校愉快学习。
    青年学生、工人参加军事干部学校的运动，是紧密结合爱国主义思想教育进行的，一般的特点是宣传酝酿时间较长，而正式报名时间只一两天即告结束。在宣传、动员阶段，许多学校通过纪念“一二、一”、“一二、九”所举行的全市性的纪念大会或分散的小型座谈会、晚会、营火会等，讨论了如何继承并发扬中国青年光荣的爱国传统；有的地方召开各界青年代表大会、青年联欢大会、学生代表大会等进行思想动员；有的地方结合正课课程进行目前形势教育及爱国主义教育。北京、上海、无锡等城市，更组织了海、空军生活的介绍报告，使同学进一步认识和热爱人民军队。各工厂也分别召开职工大会、青年工人大会，组织控诉会等。进行广泛深入的思想教育的结果，一方面解除了部分青年的若干思想顾虑，使他们认识到从普通学习岗位走向军事科学技术学习岗位，从生产建设岗位走向国防建设岗位，都是为了保卫祖国，而保卫祖国，也就是保卫自己的亲人和自己的事业。另一方面也普遍提高了留校、留厂青年的政治觉悟。在报名、审核阶段，各地招生委员会和保送委员会切实根据报名青年的身体、政治等条件，实事求是地照顾到其他建设需要、工作需要及具体困难，慎重地审核批准。许多学生都感动地说：“毛主席这样关心我们呵。”各地为参加军事干部学校的青年学生、工人在走向光荣岗位时所举行的盛大的欢送会，充满了丰富、生动的爱国主义教育的内容。上海肇光中学参加军校的学生陆荣林的六十多岁的老祖母，看到报喜队送给她“光荣人家”的条幅时，笑得合不拢嘴，连连说：“这是毛主席带来的光荣！”青岛参加军校的职工带着工厂赠给的礼物，乘坐花车，被巨大的欢送队伍呼拥启程。被欢送的工人李洪山极为感动。他想起解放以前，伙伴们参加革命，都是拿件小棉袄秘密走掉。他说：“要不是全国人民站起来了，那有这么大的光荣！”
    此次运动，获得社会广泛的同情而又推动了社会各阶层的爱国运动，运动中涌现了许多爱国家长，譬如回族的闪老太太，她已经有八个孩子参加了革命工作，现在她又送第九个孩子参加军事干部学校。上海天厨味精厂总经理吴蕴初亲送独女吴志莲参加军校，并在上海人民广播电台广播，鼓励参加军事干部学校青年的家长们说：“恭喜，恭喜！你们有了好儿女！”光荣的家长把送子女参加国防建设做为自己对于祖国所尽的一份责任。保卫祖国的光荣感已成为普遍的社会心理。当青岛自来水厂四位职工入军事干部学校时，他们披红戴花、骑在高头大马上，沿途观众像看英雄一样地鼓掌欢送他们，称赞、尊敬他们。
    学校、工厂中的共产党员与青年团员，在此次运动中起了很大的推动作用。参加军校的学生、工人中有百分之五十以上是共产党员与青年团员。他们的模范作用，影响了广大青年，扩大了党和团的政治影响。
    现在全国大部分地区的青年已分区集中，分别进入各种军事干部学校。东北、华北、华东各军事干部学校都热烈欢迎新入学的青年。在入学时，每个同学、工友最迫切希望的是领到军装。当他们穿上黄色、绿色或蓝色的新军装，戴上五星八一帽徽时，都欢呼：“我们是人民解放军了！”有的挤着照镜子，有的马上要照像寄给母亲和同学，有的兴奋地叫着：“我们要在八一旗帜下前进！”有的说：“我们不但外表上穿上军装，而且要在思想上穿起军装来！”
