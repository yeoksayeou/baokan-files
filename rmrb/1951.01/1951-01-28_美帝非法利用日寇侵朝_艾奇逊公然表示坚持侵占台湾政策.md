　　Xinhua News Agency, 26th: The Kuomintang bandit gang's Central News Agency, in a Tokyo dispatch published on the 17th, revealed that the United States has illegally used Japan to serve its war of aggression against Korea. The dispatch detailed how the United States is illegally using Japanese forces to carry out the war of aggression against Korea, stating: "In the past six and a half months, Japan has become the domestic front for the Allied forces in Korea (referring to the American invading forces in Korea), a situation very similar to that of England to the Allies during World War II. Japan's industry has been closely coordinated to support the United Nations in the Korean War, its manpower is transporting supplies to the front for the United Nations, its ships are carrying troops and supplies to Korea for the United Nations, and its docks are repairing damaged ships for the United Nations. As of November 10th last year, Japan had supplied the United Nations with supplies and labor worth 160,637,000 US dollars to carry out the Korean War.
    "Japan's more direct assistance to the United Nations comes from Japanese captains, Japanese shipping, and Japanese docks. Last June, when the Allied fleet passed through the narrow and unreliable Shimonoseki Strait to conduct the first amphibious landing in Pohang, those ships were piloted through the strait's channel by Japanese pilots. Last September, when the Allied forces carried out the historic landing in Incheon, thirty-two rented troop landing craft were captained by Japanese captains. Approximately nineteen Japanese minesweepers participated in the minesweeping operations off the coast of Wonsan. One of them was destroyed by a mine during minesweeping operations."
    "Japanese docks are freely used by the Allied fleet to repair ships damaged in combat. The Sasebo Naval Base is the largest naval anchorage of the United Nations and has repaired 35,000 tons of ships. Japanese docks have repaired eight destroyers, one aircraft carrier, and two landing craft for the Allied forces. According to statistics from the Allied Naval Headquarters, as of the beginning of November last year, Japanese docks had repaired one hundred and twelve Allied warships and transport ships operating in Korea."
    The purpose of the Kuomintang Central News Agency's Tokyo dispatch is to embolden the small group of bandits occupying Taiwan by boasting about the huge scale of the United States' illegal use of Japanese forces to invade Korea. However, as is well known, the American aggressors' robbery war in Korea, despite the support of Japan and other puppet states, has been shamefully defeated. This communication, originally intended to embolden itself, is precisely proof of the crime of the United States illegally using Japan to re-invade Asia.
    Xinhua News Agency, 26th: Washington News: U.S. Secretary of State Acheson issued a statement on the 24th, indicating that the U.S. government still adheres to its imperialist policy of aggression against our Taiwan and hostility towards the Chinese people. Acheson said, "The United States' policy toward Taiwan has not changed." "This policy is: the U.S. Seventh Fleet patrols the Taiwan Strait to prevent any attack on Taiwan." Disregarding the universally known fact that Taiwan is Chinese territory, Acheson ridiculously said, "The determination of Taiwan's future status must await the restoration of security in the Pacific region, the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan, or consideration by the United Nations." Acheson attempts to use these "reasons" to cover up the American aggression against Taiwan. However, U.S. representative to the United Nations, Gross, nakedly exposed the aggressive face of the United States in a statement on the 21st. Gross absurdly asserted that "the needs of U.S. national security will determine the future of Taiwan." According to the Associated Press, Gross's statement "is the most outspoken statement the United States has made on this issue. American sources say it clearly indicates that the highest levels of government agree with MacArthur's view that control of Taiwan is essential to American security."

　　美帝非法利用日寇侵朝
    艾奇逊公然表示坚持侵占台湾政策
    【新华社二十六日讯】国民党匪帮的中央社在其十七日发表的东京航讯中，透露了美国已非法利用日本为其侵朝战争服务。该航讯详述美国如何非法利用日军进行侵朝战争的情况称：“在过去六个半月之中，日本业已成为韩境联军（按指朝鲜美国侵略军）的国内战线，其情形酷似二次大战时期的英吉利之于盟国。日本的工业已密切的配合来支持联合国从事韩战，其人力在为联合国搬运补给至前方，其船舶在为联合国载运部队及给养至韩国，同时其船坞在为联合国修理损坏的船只。截至去年十一月十日为止，日本业已供给联合国总值一亿六千零六十三万七千美金的补给及劳力，以从事韩战。
    “日本对于联合国更为直接的协助是日本的船长、日本的航业与日本的船坞。去年六月，联军舰队经过狭长而靠不住的下关海峡，在浦项从事首次两栖登陆时，那些船舰即是由日本驾驶员领港通过该海峡的航道。去年九月，当联军在仁川从事历史性的登陆时，其中有三十二艘租来运送军队的登陆艇，便是由日本船长驾驶。为数约十九艘的日本扫雷艇，曾经参加元山海面的扫雷工作。其中一艘在进行扫雷工作时，被水雷炸毁。”
    “日本船坞业由联军舰队随意加以使用，修理作战负伤的船只。佐世保海军基地即为联合国实力最大的海军驻泊的所在，并已修好了三万五千吨的船只。日本船坞已为联军修理了八艘驱逐舰，一艘航空母舰及两艘登陆艇。据联军海军总部统计：截至去年十一月初为止，联军在朝作战及运输船舰，由日本船坞修理者已达一百十二艘。”
    国民党中央社这篇东京航讯的目的，是企图以吹嘘美国非法利用日军侵朝的巨大规模，来为窃据台湾的一小撮匪帮壮胆。但是，如所周知，美国侵略者在朝鲜进行的强盗战争，尽管有日本及其他仆从国家的支持，仍是可耻地惨败了。国民党这篇原图给它自己壮胆的通讯，恰恰是美国非法利用日本重新侵略亚洲的罪行的证明。
    【新华社二十六日讯】华盛顿讯：美国务卿艾奇逊于二十四日发表谈话，表示美国政府仍坚持其侵略我国台湾、敌视中国人民的帝国主义政策。艾奇逊说：“美国对台湾的政策未变”。“这个政策就是：美国第七舰队巡逻台湾海面，以阻止对台湾的任何进攻”。艾奇逊不顾台湾是中国领土这一举世周知的事实，竟然荒谬地说：“台湾的未来地位的决定，必需等待太平洋地区安全的恢复，对日和约的缔结，或者联合国的考虑。”艾奇逊企图借这些“理由”之助，掩饰美国对台湾的侵略。但是，美国驻联合国代表葛罗斯在二十一日的声明即赤裸裸地暴露了美国的侵略面目。葛罗斯荒谬地武断说：“美国的国家安全的需要，将决定台湾的前途。”据美联社称：葛罗斯的声明“是美国就这个问题发表的声明中最直言无讳的一个。美国人士说，它显然表明政府最高级人士赞同麦克阿瑟的意见，即：台湾的控制权对美国的安全至为重要。”
