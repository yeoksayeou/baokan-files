　　Eradicating Illusions About American Education
    Chen Xia
    The U.S. imperialist aggression against Taiwan and Korea has completely torn off all the masks of U.S. imperialism, exposing its hideous and ugly true face, making it clear to the people of China and the world. However, some people still do not understand the essence of American culture and education, and even think that educational opportunities are "equal" in the United States. This is the evil consequence of U.S. imperialism's long-term cultural aggression and the Kuomintang reactionaries' shameless deceitful propaganda. This article aims to expose the reactionary essence of American education and use facts to eradicate illusions about American education.
    1. Is American Education Above Politics?
    The Dewey doctrine, which represents the educational theory of the bourgeoisie, had a great influence on the Chinese education circle in the past, making general educators believe that "education is above politics" and that "education can transform society." As a result, they considered themselves aloof and did not care about politics, being used by the feudal and comprador ruling class without realizing it. There were also many people who were "dissatisfied with reality" at the time, but could not see the correct way to transform reality. They waved the banner of reformism and did some trivial experimental work in the education circle, trying to find a way out for Chinese society through education. This is truly like "climbing a tree to catch fish."
    In fact, the revolutionary teacher of mankind, Marx, pointed out the class nature of education long ago, and the great Lenin also pointed out that saying education is detached from politics is just a bourgeois lie. Now we don't need to refute this lie from a theoretical point of view. Just look at whether American education is above politics and whether American education has transformed the American society with its vast disparity between rich and poor, numerous unemployment, and moral corruption, and Dewey's lie will be self-defeating.
    Although the U.S. federal government does not directly manage public education, important education legislation must be passed by Congress. None of the members of Congress are representatives of workers, and the legislation passed will naturally not harm the interests of the bourgeoisie or protect the interests of the working people. For example, it is very difficult for Congress to pass a bill to subsidize education funds to various states; but it is easy to pass a military appropriation for actively preparing for war and invading Korea.
    The education boards of various states and cities directly control educational authority. The directors of these education boards are also representatives of the interests of the bourgeoisie, and not a single one truly represents the interests of workers and peasants. The education board hires an education professional to manage the education affairs of the entire state or city for the education department (bureau), and the board itself not only controls the expenditure of education funds, but also interferes with the selection of teachers and the content of the curriculum. We know that there is so-called consumption education in American schools, and this education is to advertise for capitalists. In order to sell goods, they even turn their attention to children's education. The capitalists' desire for profit is really too meticulous.
    Recent developments further illustrate that American education is under the control of fascist politics. Let's look at a few examples: (1) Since 1947, the United States has implemented universal military training in schools. Truman once claimed that the militarization of schools is a necessary guarantee for the American political system. (2) In June 1949, the Board of Regents of the University of California threatened teachers with dismissal to force them to swear allegiance to the U.S. government, and as a result, 160 faculty members were dismissed at once. (3) In June 1950, the authorities of New York University dismissed eight democratic professors, including Fingert, simply because they were responsible cadres of the Teachers' Union and had represented thousands of teachers in fighting for their due rights. (4) Since World War II, the scientific research work of American universities has been completely controlled by the military. All research work is for active war preparation rather than for peaceful construction; and the "world citizen" education in school civics classes further strengthens the fascist ideas of racial discrimination and crazy aggression. Look, is American education above politics?
    2. Is American Education Opportunity Equal?
    In the past, Chinese educators, not understanding the actual situation of American society, were misled by the single-track school system of American public schools, fantasizing that American society was democratic and mistakenly believing that American education opportunities were equal. In fact, in the United States, where class contradictions are intensifying, it is gradually embarking on the road of fascism, intensifying the oppression, exploitation, and deception of the broad masses of working people, propagating the fallacy of racial superiority, and implementing policies of discrimination against, aggression against, and enslavement of foreign ethnic groups. In such a country, hoping to achieve equality of educational opportunity is absolutely impossible.
    Ironclad facts tell us that American education is neither democratic nor equal. Because there are still a large number of school-age children in the United States who simply do not have the opportunity to go to school. In order to win votes, Truman openly admitted that the United States "still has millions of children who have no school buildings to accommodate them, nor enough teachers." (Message to Congress, January 7, 1948) After he was elected president, this situation not only did not improve at all, but became more and more serious. In 1949, as many as 6 million school-age children between the ages of 6 and 18 were out of school, accounting for 20 percent of the total number of school-age children in the United States. Due to years of military expansion, education funds have been further reduced, accounting for only 1 percent of the national budget in 1950, while military spending accounted for more than 70 percent. The phenomenon of a large number of children out of school will never change in a fascistized America. As for the education of blacks and Indians, the American bourgeois rulers not only do not seek development, but also destroy it. The Indians were originally the masters of America. Since the arrival of the whites, the Indians have been almost wiped out. Now there are only more than 300,000 left (accounting for only a little more than two-thousandths of the total U.S. population). They basically have no opportunity to receive modern cultural education now. There are now 14 to 15 million blacks (accounting for about 10 percent of the U.S. population), who are subjected to oppression and discrimination everywhere, and cannot enjoy the same rights as whites in education. When illiterates and semi-illiterates account for 13.5 percent of the total population of the United States, illiterates and semi-illiterates among blacks reach 40 percent of blacks. Official reports also admit that 14 percent of black children have never attended school. In fact, in some areas of the southern states of the United States, half of the blacks are illiterate! Originally, in a fascistized America, the lives of Indians and blacks are not guaranteed, so how can we talk about equality of educational opportunity!
    Secondly, let's look at it from the perspective of the school system. Whether a country's educational opportunity is truly equal should not only look at the school system, the school system is only a form, and there are more important things than the school system, such as the essence of education such as teachers, curriculum, and equipment. Even if we only talk about the school system, we should not be misled by the hypocritical single-track school system of the United States. It should be noted that in addition to the public school system in the United States, there is also a separate private school system. Although these two systems are largely the same in terms of length of schooling, they are essentially the same as the dual-track school systems of Britain, France, and Germany. The public school system in the United States is like the traditional primary education system in France, and the private school system is just like the traditional secondary education system in France. It is only because the United States, at the beginning of its independence, took freedom, equality, and democracy as its slogans, and did not move the traditional European school system over. But in essence, there is a public and private two-track school system in the United States.
    We can use numbers to illustrate this fact: According to the statistics for the 1933-1940 school year, the graduates of various levels of schools in the United States are shown in the following table:
School Type　　　University  High School  Primary School
Public  134,256 people  575,608 people  20,880,120 people
Private  133,740 people  380,880 people  2,382,251 people

    From this, it can be seen that in the public school system in the United States, only one out of every 36 primary school graduates can complete high school, while in the private school system, one out of every six primary school graduates can complete high school; that is, public high school graduates account for only 2.76% of public primary school graduates, while private high school graduates account for 16% of private primary school graduates. Also, only one out of every 148 public primary school graduates can complete public university, while one out of every 18 private primary school graduates can complete private university; that is, only 0.64% of public primary school graduates can graduate from public university, while 5.6% of private primary school graduates can complete private university. This assumes that students in the two systems do not transfer to each other. In fact, there must be graduates of private primary and secondary schools among the students of public universities and high schools, and those who enter public schools in primary and secondary school are unlikely to transfer to private schools in university and high school. So, in fact, the degree of inequality must be more than six or eight times greater. As for the differences between public and private schools in terms of teachers, equipment, and curriculum, they are not yet included in the estimate. Americans themselves are also worried about the lack of school buildings, simple equipment, and lack of teachers in public schools.
    In addition to the differences between public and private schools, there are also differences between urban and rural schools. In a monopolized capitalist society, the more concentrated the wealth, the greater the difference between urban and rural areas. For example, the richest state in the United States spends an average of $200 per enrolled child per year, while the poorest state spends only $3.30 per student per year, a difference of as much as 60 times. The average annual expenditure per student in all 48 states of the United States is $53, which is 16 times higher than the poorest area. From this, it can be seen that even though they are both American children, if they are unfortunately born in a poor rural area and in a working-class family, the education they receive is qualitatively different from those born in a rich area and in a bourgeois family by an unimaginable amount. To say that such American education is equal in opportunity is either ignorant or blind!
    3. Is American Academic Research Free?
    In the past, some Chinese educators also praised the academic research freedom of American universities. This made the same mistake as saying that American education is above politics.
    The United States under a bourgeois sham-democratic political system has a little more "democratic" atmosphere in some places compared to China in the past, which was ruled by the centralized representatives of feudal, comprador, and bureaucratic forces. However, unfortunately, that is only democracy within the bourgeoisie, and there is no democracy for the broad masses of people. Similarly, academic research in American universities is free within the scope that does not harm the vested interests of the bourgeoisie, but beyond this scope, if it violates their interests, there is no freedom to speak of.
    Professor Kilpatrick, a major disciple of Dewey who advocated the design teaching method, expressed a slightly just view of the Soviet Union in his later years. As a result, he was forced to retire before he reached retirement age, which was a disguised form of dismissal. Professor Counts of Columbia University once published an article "Dare Schools Build a New Social Order?", which aroused the dissatisfaction of the capitalist school board members and was once subjected to dismissal. These are still things from a long time ago, but they are enough to show that there has never been freedom of speech in the United States.
    American academic research was originally very vulgar and full of commercial colors, so it often only circled around methods and techniques, but avoided touching on the fundamental problems of society. For example, there is a thesis that obtained a master's degree in home economics, entitled "Comparison of Five Dishwashing Methods." Such "academic" research is still free in the United States; but how can this be called academic? In addition, research work that can help American capitalists make money is not only welcomed by the authorities, but also subsidized by the authorities. Sometimes, the result of a certain scientific research can improve production tools and increase productivity, but because it requires rebuilding new factories and purchasing new machines to be applied, and conflicts with the interests of capitalists; therefore, they buy this research result and put it on the shelf. Therefore, scientific research in the United States is nothing more than a bag of capitalists, and there is no freedom to speak of.
    In recent years, American politics has increasingly moved towards the road of fascism. American education has also lost the original bourgeois democratic appearance, and the freedom of academic research has also been lost. Now, most of the scientific research work in American universities has been controlled by fascist soldiers, specializing in the research of murder weapons, and also serving military fire capitalists. The government provides large amounts of scientific research funds to various universities, completely designated for military research purposes. American scientists have become tools of financial groups and warlords. Tools have no freedom, they can only bow their heads and listen to the orders of their masters!
    4. Is the Life of American Teachers Happy?
    Before liberation, some university professors in our country often hoped to have the opportunity to teach in the United States because they were dissatisfied with the meager treatment of the reactionary government; at that time, some graduates who had studied in the United States were unwilling to return to China after finding jobs in the United States. Therefore, it caused some people to have the illusion that the treatment of American teachers is generous and their lives are happy.
    Let us ask, what is the life of American teachers like?
    If we talk about material rewards, the treatment of American university professors is only enough to have a stable life, enough to support their families. But this kind of "generous" treatment is to give up the goal of pursuing truth, sacrifice the freedom of research and publication, and swear allegiance to fascist monopolistic capitalists in exchange for it!
    For example, Albert Einstein, the world-famous great scientist who was expelled from Germany by Hitler and ran to the United States, was praised as high as the sky by the public opinion circles controlled by American capitalists because he published the famous book "Theory of Gravity", and even praised him as being better than Americans. However, within a month, after he published remarks against the war of aggression and against the manufacture of hydrogen bombs, he was immediately attacked by the public opinion circles instructed by the capitalists, saying that he had no contribution to the research of atomic bombs, saying that he was ideologically left-leaning, and should be expelled from the country. Einstein is a world-class scholar, and the treatment he received in the United States was only like this. As for the persecution of ordinary professors, it has been mentioned before, and will not be repeated here.
    However, in the United States, the treatment of professors is already the pride of the sky compared to the vast majority of primary and secondary school teachers. The United States implements a single salary system for primary and secondary school teachers, and the salary is not determined by the level of the school, but by the individual's qualifications and experience, so there is no significant difference in the treatment between primary and secondary school teachers. During World War II, due to inflation and soaring prices in the United States, the treatment of teachers remained the same, which led to a widespread strike movement in various places in 1944. As a result, 350,000 teachers changed their careers and more than 6,000 schools closed.
    The vast majority of primary and secondary school teachers in the United States are women, and women also account for the majority of students in American teachers' colleges. Therefore, Americans use "she" instead of "he" as the pronoun for teachers. In American society, where the status of men and women is not truly equal, I don't know if there is some meaning of contempt. But it is a fact that the money-worshipping American philistines look down on teachers. I don't know which flattering American capitalist's court "scholar" once published a report, saying that according to the results of those incorrect "intelligence tests", the average intelligence of American college students studying education is lower than those studying other departments. This is implying that: most of those who are preparing to become teachers are fools, they deserve lower wages, and they deserve to be despised by society.
    Since the vast majority of American teachers are women, and the laws of most states in the United States deprive married women of the right to work, believing that all married women should stay at home and be parasites of their husbands. Therefore, most of the female teachers are single, young, and have no teaching experience. Moreover, the single life also causes these young female teachers to be psychologically unhealthy; or in order to maintain their jobs, they live with their boyfriends but dare not marry. How painful this is!
    In short, under the "American way of life", the life of teachers is like this.

　　肃清对美国教育的幻想
    陈侠
    美帝国主义侵略台湾、朝鲜的暴行，彻底撕毁了美帝的一切假面具，赤裸裸地暴露了它的狰狞丑恶的真面目，使全中国、全世界的人民看得清清楚楚。然而对美帝的文化教育的实质，还有些人不大了解，甚至以为在美国，受教育的机会是“均等”的。这是美帝的长期文化侵略和国民党反动派无耻的欺骗宣传的恶果。本文就是要揭穿美国教育的反动实质，用事实来肃清对美国教育的幻想。
    一、美国教育是超政治的吗？
    代表资产阶级教育理论的杜威学说，对过去中国教育界有很大的影响，使一般教育工作者相信“教育是超政治的”，相信“教育就可以改造社会”，因而他们自鸣清高，不问政治，受了封建、买办统治阶级的利用而不自知。还有许多人当时虽“不满现实”，但看不见改造现实的正确途径。他们打着改良主义的旗帜，在教育圈子里做一些枝枝节节的实验工作，想从教育上来寻找中国社会的出路，这真好象“缘木求鱼”了。
    其实，人类革命导师马克思早就指出了教育的阶级性，伟大的列宁也曾指出：说教育超然于政治不过是资产阶级的谎言。现在我们不必从理论上来驳斥这种谎言，只要看一看美国教育是不是超政治，美国的教育曾否把那贫富悬殊、失业众多、道德败坏的美国社会改造好，则杜威的谎言也就不攻自破了。
    美国联邦政府虽不直接管理公共教育事业，但重要的教育立法要经国会通过，国会的议员中没有一个工人的代表，通过的立法自然不会损及资产阶级的利益，不会保障劳动人民的利益。例如国会里要通过一个联邦补助各州教育经费的法案，非常不易；但通过一个积极备战和侵略朝鲜的军事拨款，却是轻而易举。
    直接掌握教育职权的是各州、各市的教育董事会，这些教育董事会的董事们也全是资产阶级利益的代表人，没有一个真正代表工农利益的分子。教育董事会雇用一个教育专业分子替教育厅（局）长来管理全州、全市的教育事业，而董事本身不仅控制着教育经费的开支，而且干预师资的人选和课程的内容。我们知道美国学校中有所谓消费的教育，这种教育就是替资本家做广告的。为了推销商品，竟把念头转到儿童教育上来，资本家追求利润的心思真是太细密了。
    最近事态的发展，更足以说明美国教育是在法西斯政治控制之下。我们举几个例子来看：（一）自一九四七年起，美国实施了普遍的学校军训，杜鲁门曾经声称，学校军事化是美国现在政治制度的必要保障。（二）一九四九年六月，加州大学董事会以解聘来要挟教师们向美国政府宣誓效忠，结果有教职员一百六十人被一次解聘。（三）一九五○年六月，纽约大学当局解聘了芬各特等八位民主教授，只因为他们是教员联合会的负责干部，曾代表数千教师，争取应得的权利。（四）自二次大战以还，美国大学的科学研究工作完全控制在军人手中，一切研究工作都是为了积极备战而不是为了和平建设；而学校公民科里的“世界公民”教育，更加强灌输着法西斯的种族歧视和疯狂侵略的思想。你看，美国教育是超政治的吗？
    二、美国教育机会是平等的吗？
    过去我国教育学者，不明了美国社会的实际情况，为美国公立学校的单轨学制所迷惑，幻想着美国社会是民主的，误认为美国教育机会是平等的。其实，在阶级矛盾尖锐化的美国，正逐步走着法西斯的道路，加紧压迫、剥削、欺骗广大劳动人民，宣传种族优越的谬论，推行着歧视异民族、侵略异民族和奴役异民族的政策。在这样的国家里，希望做到教育机会平等是绝不可能的。
    铁一般的事实告诉我们：美国的教育是既不民主又不平等的。因为美国还有大量学龄儿童，根本没有机会上学。杜鲁门为了争取选票，曾公开承认美国“还有千百万儿童没有校舍容纳，也没有足够数目的教师。”（一九四八年一月七日致国会咨文）到了他当选总统以后，这种情况非但一点也没有改善，而且愈趋严重了。一九四九年六至十八岁的学龄儿童失学的达六百万人之多，这个数目占全美国学龄儿童总数的百分之二十。连年因扩张军备，教育费更加缩减，一九五○年仅占国家预算的百分之一，而军费却占了百分之七十以上。失学儿童众多的现象，在法西斯化的美国是永不会改变的。至于对黑人和红人的教育，美国资产阶级统治者们不但不谋发展，而且还在摧残。红人原是美洲的主人，自白人到达美洲后，红人已被消灭殆尽，现只剩三十余万人（约占全美国人口的千分之二强），他们现在基本上没有接受现代文化教育的机会。黑人现有一千四、五百万（约占全美国人口百分之十），处处遭受压迫和歧视，教育上更不能和白人享受同等的权利。当全美国的文盲和半文盲占全人口百分之十三点五时，黑人中的文盲和半文盲达到黑人中的百分之四十。官方的报告也承认黑人儿童中有百分之十四从来未进过学校。事实上在美国南部诸州，某些地区黑人中有半数都是文盲！本来在法西斯化的美国，红人和黑人的生命还没有保障，那里还谈得到教育机会的平等呢！
    其次，我们再从学制方面来看。一国教育机会是否真正平等，不应仅看学制，学制只是形式，还有比学制更重要的师资、课程、设备等教育的实质。纵使单谈学制，我们也不要为美国那套虚伪的单轨学制所迷惑。须知美国除公立学校系统以外，还另有一套私立学校系统。这两套系统在修业年限上虽大同小异，但本质上是和英、法、德等国双轨的学制相同，美国的公立学校系统犹如法国传统的初等教育系统，而私立学校系统也正如法国传统的中等教育系统。只因美国在独立之初，以自由、平等、民主为口号，没有把欧洲传统的学制搬过去罢了。但实质上美国是有公、私两轨的学制存在的。
    我们可以用数字来说明这个事实：据一九三三——四四十个年度的统计，美国各级学校毕业生如下表：校别　　　大学  中学  小学　　公立  一三四、二五六人  五七五、六○八人  二○、八八○、一二○人私立  一三三、七四○人  三八○、八八○人　 二、三八二、二五一人
    由此可知在美国公立学校系统中，每三十六个小学毕业生当中，才能有一人读完中学，而在私立学校系统中，每六个小学毕业生当中便可有一人读完中学；即公立中学毕业生仅占公立小学毕业生百分之二·七六，而私立中学毕业生却占私立小学毕业生百分之十六。又每一百四十八个公立小学毕业生中才能有一人读完公立大学，而每十八个私立小学毕业生中便可有一人读完私立大学；即公立小学毕业生中能毕业于公立大学者仅占百分之○·六四，而私立小学毕业生中能读完私立大学者却占百分之五·六。这是假设两个系统的学生不互相转学，事实上公立大、中学校的学生里一定有私立中、小学的毕业生，而在中、小学时期入公立学校的，很少有可能到大、中学时期转入私立学校。所以实际上不平等的程度必不止六倍与八倍的。至于公、私立学校在师资、设备和课程上的差别，尚未估计在内。美国人自己也在为公立学校校舍不足、设备简陋和师资缺乏而担忧。
    除去公、私立学校的差别以外，还有城、乡学校的差别。在垄断的资本主义社会中，财富愈集中，城乡的差别也就愈大。如美国最富的州每年平均为每个入学儿童用二百元，而最贫瘠的州，每生岁占费仅有三元三角，相差达六十倍之多。全美四十八州每生岁占费的平均数为五十三元，较最贫瘠之区也高十六倍。由此可见，同是美国的儿童，不幸生在贫瘠的乡区和劳动人民的家庭里，所受的教育，就要比生在富庶的地区和资产阶级家庭里的，在质量上相差不可以道里计了。说这样的美国教育是机会平等的，真是非愚即盲了！
    三、美国学术研究是自由的吗？
    过去中国也曾有些教育学者称道过美国大学的学术研究自由。这和说美国教育是超政治的犯了同样的错误。
    资产阶级假民主政体下的美国，比起过去在封建、买办和官僚的集中代表者统治下的中国来，某些地方是比较有一点“民主”的气息。然而可惜那只是资产阶级内部的民主，对于广大的人民，并没有什么民主可言。同样，美国大学的学术研究，在不损及资产阶级既得利益的范围内是有自由的，但超出了这个范围，触犯了他们的利益，也就没有自由可说了。
    杜威的大弟子、提倡设计教学法的克伯屈教授，在晚年的言论中对于苏联稍有正义的表示，结果未到退休年龄，便被强迫退休，这是一种变相的解聘。哥仑比亚大学康慈教授曾经发表“学校敢于建立一种新的社会秩序吗？”一文，引起了资本家校董们的不满，也曾一度遭受解聘的处分。这些还是很久以前的事，但足以说明美国一向是没有讲学自由的。
    美国的学术研究本来是很庸俗的，充满了商业化的色彩，所以往往只在方法技术上绕圈子，而避免涉及社会的根本问题。例如有一篇得到家政硕士学位的论文，题目叫“五种洗碗方法的比较。”这样的“学术”研究，在美国还是有自由的；可是，这那里配称做学术呢？此外，可以帮助美国资本家赚钱的研究工作，不但受当局欢迎，还可得到当局的补助。有时某种科学研究的结果，本可以改进生产工具和提高生产力的，但由于需要重建新厂，另置机器，才能应用，和资本家的利益冲突；于是他们便把这个研究结果收买下来，束之高阁。因此科学研究在美国不过是资本家的囊中物，根本没有什么自由可言。
    近年以来，美国政治日益走向法西斯化的道路。美国教育也失去了原有的那一点资产阶级民主的面貌，而学术研究的自由也随之丧失殆尽了。现在美国大学中的科学研究工作，大部已控制在法西斯军人手中，专门研究杀人的利器，同时也在为军火资本家服务。政府大量补助各大学的科学研究费，完全指定作军事研究的用途。美国科学家成了财阀和军阀的工具，工具是没有自由的，只有俯首贴耳听从主人的支配而已！
    四、美国教师的生活是幸福的吗？
    在解放前，我国有些大学教授，因不满反动政府菲薄的待遇，常希望能有机会到美国去教书；那时，也有一些留美的毕业生，在美国找到工作便不愿归国。因此引起一部分人的幻想，以为美国教师的待遇是优厚的，生活是幸福的。
    试问美国教师的生活究竟如何呢？
    若从物质的报酬来说，美国大学教授的待遇也仅仅可以有一个安定的生活，足以养家活口而已。但这一种“优厚”的待遇，是要放弃追求真理的目标、牺牲研究发表的自由、并宣誓向法西斯独占资本家效忠来换取的！
    例如曾被希特勒逐出德国跑到美国去的世界著名大科学家爱因斯坦，因为发表了名著“引力论”，曾被在美国资本家控制下的舆论界捧得天样高，甚至赞扬他比美国人还行。可是不出一月，当他发表了反对侵略战争反对制造氢弹的言论以后，立即遭受资本家指使下的舆论界的攻击，说他对原子弹的研究没有贡献，说他思想左倾，应该驱逐出境。爱因斯坦是世界第一流的学者，在美国所受的待遇不过如此。至于一般教授遭受迫害的情形，前已述及，兹不赘。
    不过，在美国，教授的待遇，比起占极大多数的中、小学教师来已是天之骄子了。美国对中、小学教师实行单一薪制，不按学校的等级定薪金的高低，而按个人的资格和经验，所以中、小学教师之间的待遇，没有显著的差别。二次大战期间，美国由于通货膨胀，物价剧增，而教师待遇依旧，以致到一九四四年各地普遍展开了罢教运动，结果有三十五万教师改业，六千多所学校关门。
    美国的中、小学教师，极大多数是女子，美国师范院、校的学生中也以女子占大多数。因此美国人称教师的人称代名词用“她”而不用“他”，在男女地位并未真正平等的美国社会里，不知是否有些轻视的意味。但拜金主义者的美国市侩，瞧不起教师却是千真万确的事实。不知是那一个善逢迎的美国资本家的御用“学者”曾发表过一个报告，他根据那些不正确的“智力测验”的结果，说美国大学生里，读师范的平均要比读其他科系的智力为低。这就是暗示着：准备当教师的大都是些蠢货，活该得较低的工资，活该受社会的轻视。
    美国教师中既然极大多数是女子，而美国各州的法律，大多剥夺了已婚女子的工作权，认为凡结了婚的女子便应守在家里做丈夫的寄生虫。所以女教师当中也大多是独身的、年青的、没有教学经验的。而且独身的生活，也造成这些青年女教师心理上的不健康；或者为了维持饭碗，虽与男友同居而不敢结婚。这是何等苦痛！
    总之，在“美国的生活方式”之下，教师的生活就是如此。
