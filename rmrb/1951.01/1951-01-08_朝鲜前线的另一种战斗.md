　　Another Battle on the Korean Front
　　By our Special Correspondent Yang Shuo
　　After suffering a crushing defeat on the eastern and western fronts, the enemy, unwilling to accept defeat, is waging a desperate struggle against North Korea through another kind of war.

　　This is the bombing of the railway lines north of Pyongyang. Day and night, even on windy and snowy nights, American planes painted with pentagrams fly in packs, rampaging wildly for a while.

　　The enemy has tried various methods to disrupt our transportation lines. But as ingenious as they may be, they overlooked one problem: their opponents are the Chinese volunteer railway workers and the Korean people. The enemy's bombs can never eradicate the righteous ideas of mankind's desire for happiness and freedom from the earth, and can never defeat these thoughtful, faithful, and organized Chinese and Korean people.

　　Gong Xichang is one of the many who wrote a letter of determination to resist America and aid Korea. He believes his work is: "Every swing of the pickaxe is equivalent to eliminating an American soldier!" The American bombs kept falling. When a bridge was burned, black smoke enveloped it, and nothing could be seen. Gong Xichang led people into the flames, braving the bombing to put out the fire, and immediately started repairing the bridge. Around midnight, just as it was about to be repaired, with military vehicles waiting to cross the river on the other side of the bridge, enemy planes came again, dropping flares, and all that could be heard was the whirring sound of bullets flying around. Some people panicked and wanted to hide. Gong Xichang thought, if the bridge wasn't repaired before dawn, the military vehicles wouldn't be able to cross, and that would be a major setback.

　　He jumped out and shouted: "Quick, get in line! This is the cause of our Party and the people! It doesn't matter if a few of us sacrifice ourselves, so many vehicles on the other side must cross the bridge!"

　　The workers no longer ran. The planes above were still buzzing. Everyone put out their lights. In the dark, all that could be heard was the sound of hammers hitting and nails ringing. Some people couldn't see clearly and hammered their hands, but they didn't stop. Before dawn, the bridge was finally repaired. Military vehicles loaded with supplies victoriously drove across the bridge.

　　One day, I was in a broken water tower at a station, and I saw a Korean worker climbing a pole to set up a power line. The planes were circling tightly overhead. A Korean military officer was so anxious that he kept signaling to him, but the outstanding Korean worker remained calm and composed, doing his work as usual. I don't know his name, but I know the names of many more outstanding people.

　　Chinese communication worker Feng Dekui saw a plane coming while on the pole, hugged the pole, and shielded himself. When the plane went south, he moved to the north side; when the plane went north, he moved to the south side, never interrupting his work of stringing the line.

　　Gao Chengxin is a communication worker who was awarded a prize in the same event as Gong Xichang. That day, enemy planes bombed the bridge and broke all the wires. Knowing that a break in the phone line would affect the driving, he immediately ran onto the bridge with Zhou Jinfeng and climbed to the top of the truss to connect the wires. A small plane rushed over and swept down a burst of machine gun fire, breaking the newly connected wires again. The fire on the bridge was raging, and the smoke choked people's tears. They braved the danger to continue connecting. Suddenly, another plane rushed down and dropped two bombs. Sand and water from the river splashed on them, and their heads were shaken so much that the bridge seemed to tremble. Zhou Jinfeng was anxious, afraid of delaying the call, and when he threw the wire, he cut a large gash in his hand and had to replace him with someone else. By noon, the line was connected; in the afternoon, it was bombed again, and then connected again. That day, from morning to night, Gao Chengxin didn't leave the bridge. He came back for a meal in the evening, and the line was broken again, so he ran back to the bridge overnight, harboring a belly full of anger, thinking, "Let's see how much you can bomb!" With him there, it naturally couldn't be broken.

　　There are also time bombs that explode after a day and night, or even a few days. The enemy is vicious, and deliberately uses other bombs to stir up soil and bury these things. The workers can't see them, and while they're working, they suddenly explode. Korean worker Xu Shun was injured in this way. Sometimes the enemy deliberately throws a few of them on the bridge and railway lines. Among them, one type has a wind gourd-like thing on its tail that whirs and spins, as if it will explode immediately, but it may not explode for some time, making you afraid to move. The enemy wants to use this to prevent our trains from running.

　　This kind of ghostly method is nothing more than a tattered inheritance from Hitler. No matter how fiercely the wind gourd spins, the soldiers of the Korean Railway Company still dig it out and haul it to the wilderness with an ox cart.

　　There were also workers who found a time bomb inserted in the mud while repairing the line and stopped working because they were afraid. It's false to say it's not dangerous, two had just exploded, splashing water all over everyone. Li Shuyou, who had a large pile of labor medals hanging on his chest, thought to himself, "If it explodes when the train is running, the loss will be great!" Dig it out. Who will do it? He smiled and said to everyone, "You all concentrate on your work, I'll ask it to leave! Anyway, I won't touch its brain, and if I hold its butt, it won't bite me!" So he slowly dug out the bomb alone, held it in both hands, and threw it into the river. "Let it explode!"

　　This is naturally a dangerous thing. But Li Shuyou understood: if the railway is not open, military supplies cannot be transported, and the victory on the front line will not be guaranteed. For the sake of righteous victory, what does personal safety matter? In the face of such people, the planes that the United States relies on are bound to fail - in fact, they have already completely failed.

　　In the clear skies of North Korea, we can also often see the nimble planes of the People's Army, like swallows, surrounding and chasing those aerial bandits. Today, we saw an enemy plane hit so that its tail was smoking black, howling like a mourning dog as it crashed to the ground.

　　This enemy plane is foreshadowing the future fate of American imperialism.

### 朝鲜前线的另一种战斗

　　朝鲜前线的另一种战斗
    本报特约记者  杨朔
    敌人在东西两线吃了大败仗后，还不死心，用另一种战争向北朝鲜做着绝望的挣扎。
    这就是对平壤以北各铁路线的轰炸。没昼没夜，甚至于刮风下雪的晚上，涂着五角星的美国飞机也会成群结队的飞来，耍疯撒野似地闹上一阵。
    敌人想了种种办法来破坏我们的交通线。但是，他们想得尽管巧妙，可就没想到一个问题：他的对手是中国志愿援朝的铁路工人跟朝鲜人民。敌人的炸弹永远不能从地球上扫除掉人类要求幸福自由的正义思想，就永远不能战胜这些有思想，有信仰，有组织的中朝人民。
    宫希昌是许许多多写下抗美援朝决心书的一个。他认为自己的工作是：“刨一洋镐，就等于消灭一个美国兵！”美国的炸弹一个劲扔，有座桥烧了，黑烟包围住桥，什么都看不见。宫希昌领着人钻到火焰里去，冒着轰炸扑灭了火，又马上动手修桥。半夜前后，将要修成，桥那岸正有军车等着过河，敌人的飞机又来了，扔下照明弹，光听见哗哗哗哗，子弹在身边乱飞。有人慌得要躲，宫希昌一想，要是天亮前修不好，军车不能过桥，就要误了大事。
    他跳出来叫道：“赶快站排！这是咱们党和人民的事业！咱们几个人牺牲了没关系，对岸那么多车一定要过桥！”
    工人们都不再跑。头上的飞机还是嗡嗡响，大家吹灭灯，黑地里只听见锤子打，钉子响，有人看不见，钉破了手，也不歇。不等天亮，桥到底修成了。装满物资的军车胜利地开过桥去。
    有一个白天，我在一个车站的破水塔里，亲眼看见有个朝鲜工人爬在杆子上架电线，头上的飞机紧转，一位朝鲜军官急得朝他直打招呼，那个出色的朝鲜工人却声色不动，照样从从容容地做活。我不知道他叫什么名字，却知道更多出色人物的名字。
    中国通讯工冯德魁在杆子上看见飞机来了，把杆子一抱，掩住身子。飞机到南，他转到北边；飞机到北，他又转到南边，一直没间断过架线。
    高成信是跟宫希昌在一回事里受奖的通讯工。那天，敌人的飞机炸桥，把电线都打断了。他知道电话一断，就影响开车，当时跟周金发跑上桥去，爬到花梁高头接线。一架小飞机冲过来，一梭子机枪子弹扫下来，刚接好的线又断了。桥上火正猛，烟呛的人流泪。他俩冒着险还是往前接，冷不防又是一架飞机冲下来，丢下两个炸弹，河里的沙子跟水崩到身上，脑袋震得看到桥都乱颤。周金发心急，怕耽误通话，一摔线，手割了一道大口子，只好另换个人。赶晌午，线接通；下半晌又炸坏了，又接。这天，从早到晚，高成信也没下桥，傍晚回来吃了顿饭，线又断了，连夜又跑上桥去，满肚子窝着股怒火想：“看你有多大本事来炸断！”有他，自然炸不断。
    还有一种定时炸弹，一天一夜才炸，也有延长几天的。敌人心毒，还故意用旁的炸弹崩起土来，埋住这些玩意儿。工友也看不见，做着做着活，忽然响了。朝鲜工人许顺就是这样受的伤。有时敌人又故意在桥梁线路上扔几个。当中有一种，尾巴上带着个风葫芦似的东西，呜呜乱转，好像立时要炸，其实不定几时才炸，叫你动又不敢动。敌人想用此阻止我们的行车。
    这种鬼办法，无非是从希特勒继承的破烂衣钵。风葫芦由你转得再凶，朝鲜铁道连队的战士们还是把它挖出来，用牛车拖着掀到野地去。
    也有工友抢修线路时，发现定时炸弹插在泥里，停了手不敢做活。说不危险是假的，刚刚就响了两个，崩得大伙满身是水。前胸挂着一大堆劳动奖章的李树有心想：“要是走车时，一响，损失就大了！”挖出去吧。谁动手呢？他对大家笑着说道：“你们都安心做活去，我请它走！反正我不动它脑瓜子，抱它屁股，就咬不着我！”于是一个人慢慢挖出那炸弹，两手抱着，丢到河里。“让它响去吧！”
    这自然是件险事。可是李树有明白：铁路要是不通，军需运不上去，前线的胜利就没有保证。为了正义的胜利，个人的安全又算什么呢？在这样的人面前，美国倚仗的飞机永远是要失败的——事实上它已经完全失败了。
    在北朝鲜清朗的天空，我们也时常可以看见象燕子一样敏捷的人民军的飞机，包围追逐那些空中土匪。今天，我们就曾看见一架敌机被打得尾巴冒着黑烟，嚎丧似地叫着跌到地面上去。
    这架敌机正预示着美帝未来的命运。
