　　For the Most Wonderful Happiness in the World
    By Ni. Tikhonov, Translated by Liu Qun

    We gather here from every corner of the Earth, for the most wonderful happiness in the world. Children, holding flowers, enter the hall, clearly messengers of spring have arrived.

　Outside the wall is a glorious city, doves of peace flutter on the windows here, and amidst the flowers, on the tables, stands a little girl from Warsaw.

　Such a thing exists: the heavy hardships have passed, like a simple sentence flying before your eyes; I truly saw with my own eyes: a child's gentle hand caressing the shoulder of a Chinese.

　She looks at the vast world with joyful eyes, as if looking at this magnificent hall; our hearts seem to hear everything, everything she hasn't yet said.

　Is she called Aniela? Or Yada? All names belong to her—the entire universe is contained in her wonderful gaze, all roads are open for her to travel.

　And in the slender beauty reflecting brilliance, it is not merely a congratulation for childhood—all the future in the child's face is worthy of and begs for our protection.

    This poem was written by the famous Soviet poet and Chairman of the Soviet Committee for the Defense of World Peace, Nikolai Tikhonov, on November 21st at the Second World Peace Congress in Warsaw. At that time, a group of Polish children came to the venue to present flowers to the congress. Guo Moruo, the head of the Chinese delegation, and Liu Ningyi, the secretary-general, held two little girls holding flowers in their arms. Warm applause rang out throughout the hall. After the poem was completed, the author personally sent the manuscript to the Chinese delegation, saying that it was a gift to the Chinese people.

    The words "Aniela" and "Yada" used in the poem are common names for Polish children.

　　为了世界上最美好的幸福
    尼·吉洪诺夫作  刘群译
    我们从地球的各个角落聚会到这里，为了世界上最美好的幸福，孩子们捧着鲜花走进会场，分明是来了春之使者。
　墙外是一座光荣的城市，这里的窗子上飞舞着和平鸽子，在鲜花丛中，在桌子上面，站着华沙的小女孩子。
　有这样的事情呢：重重艰难都已过去，好像一行简单的句子在你的眼前飞扬；我真的亲眼看见：孩子的轻柔的手，抚摩在中国的肩膀上。
　她用愉快的眼光看着辽阔的世界，就像看着这个辉煌的大厅似的，我们的心灵仿佛听到了，她还没说出来的一切的一切。
　她叫安涅拉？还是亚达？所有的名字都归她所有——整个宇宙都含在她的美妙的眼光里，条条大路任凭她去行走。
　而且在映射着光辉的纤秀的美丽里，不单单是童年生活的祝贺——孩子的容颜里的一切未来，都值得而且请求着我们的佑护。
    这首诗是苏联名诗人及苏联保卫世界和平大会主席吉洪诺夫于十一月二十一日在华沙二届和大会场上所作。当时一群波兰儿童来到会场向大会献花，中国代表团团长郭沫若和秘书长刘宁一把两个捧花的小女孩抱在怀里。全场响起了热烈的掌声。诗作成后，作者亲将稿子送给中国代表团，说这是他给中国人民的一份礼物。
    诗中所用“安涅拉”与“亚达”两字是波兰儿童常用的名字。
