　　Hebei Organizes Mass Transportation Network
    Promotes Urban-Rural Material Exchange

    [Dispatch from this newspaper] According to Xinhua News Agency: The mass transportation network organized by the state-owned Hebei Provincial Transportation Company has played a significant role in the exchange of urban and rural materials since the autumn of 1950.
    The Hebei Province mass transportation network is organized along the four major railways passing through the province: Beijing-Hankou, Tianjin-Pukou, Beijing-Shenyang, and Shijiazhuang-Dezhou, as well as major rivers. The province is divided into five transportation branch companies, thirty-three transfer stations, seventeen bus stations, and temporary transfer and agency stations. The Provincial Transportation Company organized the east and west mass transportation lines on both sides of the Beijing-Hankou and Tianjin-Pukou railways, which run vertically through the province from north to south. On both sides of the Shijiazhuang-Dezhou and Beijing-Shenyang railways, which run horizontally through the province from east to west, the company organized mass transportation lines to the south and north. It also utilized inland rivers and highways to organize wooden boat and automobile transportation. In this way, the province's waterways and land routes, wheeled carts, handcarts, trains, automobiles, boats, and land transportation tools are fully integrated. From rural areas to cities, from transportation hubs to remote mountainous areas, the public and private transportation forces are organized into a province-wide transportation army. According to recent statistics, a total of more than 10,000 mass carts and more than 3,700 wooden boats have been organized. Among all the carts, in addition to some that are regularly fixed for transportation in one place, there are 5,000 privately-owned professional transportation carts that are available for flexible dispatch at any time. According to incomplete statistics (including round-trip transportation costs): horse-drawn carts have transported more than 740,000 tons of materials, boats have transported more than 120,000 tons, and automobiles have transported more than 20,000 tons.
    The Hebei Province mass transportation network played a significant role in coordinating with the government to stabilize prices. Not long after new cotton was put on the market last year, grain prices in the cotton-producing areas of Linqing and Nangong were once 30% higher than in non-cotton-producing areas. The transportation company transferred a large number of private carts from Renqiu, Anci, and other non-cotton-producing areas to cotton-producing areas such as Anguo, Hengshui, and Shijiazhuang. It also organized automobiles and boats to actively cooperate with the state-owned grain company to transport large quantities of grain to the cotton-producing areas, promoting a balance in grain prices between regions and a more rational ratio between cotton and grain prices in cotton-producing areas.
    In terms of organizing the export of local products and the exchange of industrial and agricultural products, the Hebei Province mass transportation network helped Gaoyang merchants transport more than 200,000 kilograms of local cotton cloth and other sideline products to Chahar, Suiyuan, Henan, and Shaanxi, and helped state-owned companies transport large quantities of cotton, local products, and mountain goods purchased from farmers to Beijing, Shanghai, and other places. In addition, through joint transportation and agency purchases and sales, it promoted the sale of Jingxing coal, which was once unsalable, to the masses and brick kilns in Dingxian, Baoding, and other places where coal was generally scarce.
    The Hebei Province mass transportation network has recently been using the slack farming season in winter to organize the masses to transport large quantities of sideline products.
    Recently, the rivers have frozen, and the Hebei Province mass transportation network is preparing to organize farmers to carry out ice sled transportation to supplement the lack of transportation capacity.
    The key to the formation of the large-scale Hebei Province mass transportation network is: the state-owned Hebei Provincial Transportation Company actively promoted it, taking into account the interests of the production, transportation, and sales parties, stipulating different freight rates for different transportation tools, and frequently grasping the source of goods to organize return freight and reduce empty trips.

　　河北组织群众运输网
    推动了城乡物资交流
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：国营河北省运输公司组织的群众运输网，在一九五○年秋季以来的城乡物资交流中起了很大的作用。
    河北省群众运输网是沿着经过省内的京汉、津浦、北宁、石德四大铁路及各条主要河流组成的。全省共分设五个运输分公司、三十三个转运站、十七个汽车站和临时性的转运站、代理站。省运输公司在纵贯省内南北的京汉、津浦铁路两侧，组织了群众的东、西运输线，在横贯省内东西的石德、北宁铁路两侧，公司组织了群众的南、北运输线；并利用内河和公路，组织了木船和汽车运输，这样就将全省的水路与旱路，铁轮车、手推车和火车、汽车，船只与陆上运输工具完全结合起来。从农村到城市，从交通要道到偏僻的山地，把公营和私营的运输力量组成了遍及全省的运输大军。据最近统计，共已组织群众大车万余辆，木船三千七百多只。在所有大车中，除部分经常固定一地运输外，并有五千辆私营运输专业大车，随时可供灵活调度。据不完全统计（包括往返运费）：马车运输物资已达七十四万多吨，船运十二万多吨，汽车运输两万多吨。
    河北省群众运输网在配合政府稳定物价中曾发挥很大作用。去年新棉上市不久，临清、南宫等产棉区粮价曾一度高于非产棉区百分之三十。运输公司把非产棉区任邱、安次等地私营大车大批调往安国、衡水、石家庄等产棉区，并组织汽车、船只积极配合国营粮食公司运送大批粮食到产棉区，促进了地区间粮价平衡和产棉区棉粮比价趋于合理。
    在组织土产输出及工农业产品的交换方面，河北省群众运输网曾给高阳商人联运当地棉布等副业产品二十多万公斤到察哈尔、绥远、河南、陕西等地，给国营公司联运收购农民的大批棉花和土产山货等到北京、上海等地。此外，又曾以联运和代购代销的方式，把一度滞销的井陉煤推销到普遍缺煤的定县、保定等地群众和砖窑中去。
    河北省群众运输网最近又利用冬季农闲时间，组织群众运输大量副业产品。
    近来河道已经结冰，河北省群众运输网正准备组织农民进行冰床运输，以补运输力之不足。
    规模巨大的河北省群众运输网能够组成的关键是：国营河北省运输公司积极推动，照顾到产、运、销三方利益，规定了不同运输工具的不同运价，并经常掌握货源，组织拉回货，减少空返。
