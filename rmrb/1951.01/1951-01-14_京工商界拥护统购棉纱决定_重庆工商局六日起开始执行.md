Xinhua News Agency, January 12th - The Beijing business community supports the decision of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government on the unified purchase of cotton yarn. The preparatory committee of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce convened a forum at 2:00 PM on the 11th, gathering the heads of seven industry associations: knitting, weaving and dyeing, dyeing workers, rubber, chemical, electrical materials, and silk cloth and yarn. They exchanged opinions on the State Council Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government's order to implement the unified purchase of cotton yarn. Representatives of each industry unanimously supported the decision of the Central Financial and Economic Committee in their speeches, believing that reasonable regulations on raw material and finished product prices would greatly guarantee production, overcome speculation targeting cotton yarn, and ensure price stability.

The preparatory committee of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce issued a statement saying: "After reading the content of the 'Decision on Unified Purchase of Cotton Yarn,' we clearly recognize that the government has put a lot of effort into issuing this measure for the rational supply of yarn and cloth. The main goal is to ensure reasonable production, regulate supply and demand, and stabilize prices. Based on the correctness and necessity of this measure, we, the industrialists and merchants of Beijing, unanimously express our support and are even more willing to assist and cooperate with the government in striving to implement this necessary measure."

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, January 12th - The decision of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government on the unified purchase of cotton yarn has been implemented in Chongqing. The Chongqing Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce announced that all yarn factories would cease selling goods on the market from January 6th and notified all yarn factories to register their existing inventory with the state-owned cotton yarn and cloth company before the 8th, which would be purchased by the cotton yarn and cloth company. The Southwest Branch of the state-owned cotton yarn and cloth company has been responsible for the entire market supply since the 6th; at the same time, the minimum purchase quantity has been reduced from the original one bale to half a bale to take care of yarn purchasers with smaller capital. The Chongqing Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce also invited the heads of the General Labor Union, the state-owned cotton yarn and cloth company, and various public and private yarn factories on the 5th to exchange opinions on the issues of labor fees and unified purchase prices.
