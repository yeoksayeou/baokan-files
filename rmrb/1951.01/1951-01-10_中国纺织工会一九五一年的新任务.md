　　Chairman of the National Committee of the China Textile Workers' Union Chen Shaomin
　　Editor's Note: This article is the fourth section of Comrade Chen Shaomin, Chairman of the National Committee of the China Textile Workers' Union's article "New Tasks for the China Textile Workers' Union in 1951." The full text consists of four sections: the first section is "Our Achievements in the Past Year," the second section is "Workers and Staff's Hard Work," the third section is "Shortcomings in Our Work," and the fourth section is the article here, "New Tasks for 1951." The full text was published on the fourth page of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions' newspaper, *Workers' Daily*, on January 1st and 3rd, 1951.
　　The production tasks of the textile industry in 1951 are arduous. We call on all textile workers and staff to exert the greatest enthusiasm and creativity to successfully complete the new tasks of 1951.
　　1. Launch a patriotic production campaign. The goals for 1951 are to increase production, improve quality, eliminate waste, and reduce costs. Whether it is cotton, wool, linen, silk, knitting, printing and dyeing, bobbin, machinery, chemical factories, all should strive to reduce costs by 1% to 2%. Cotton textile factories should strive to ensure that the amount of cotton used for each yarn count does not exceed 400 catties, strive to create a relatively scientific production quota within 1951, and strive to complete twelve months of production plans in eleven months. Those with the highest output should create new records in quality, while those with lower output should increase production on the premise of improving quality, eliminating waste, and reducing costs, to meet the needs of the people. Trade union cadres should learn to calculate costs, announce results in a timely manner, consolidate and enhance the production enthusiasm of the masses, and the advanced should lead the backward, with state-owned factories leading private factories, to improve the overall production level and work level. Lay the foundation for the development of the textile industry technically, organizationally, and ideologically. Workers and staff in private factories should recognize that doing a good job in the production of private factories is beneficial to the entire country, the people, and the working class. Only by doing a good job in production can the lives of the entire people and the working class be gradually improved with the development of production. Therefore, workers and staff in private factories should also actively launch production competitions, increase production and quality, eliminate waste, and reduce costs, and create new records in production. However, trade union cadres must remember that the trade union is a mass organization of the working class. We stand on the position of the working class, do a good job in production, and complete the state production tasks. On the premise of protecting the interests of the working class, we strive to unite with the capitalists. Any unprincipled concessions or compromises are wrong.
　　Local textile trade union organizations should, in accordance with local specific conditions, universally sign collective contracts with administrative or capitalist parties, clarify the responsibilities of both parties, and fulfill the matters stipulated in the contract.
　　Strengthen the work of factory management committees and labor-capital consultation meetings, effectively give play to the role of representative conferences, and trade unions in private factories should also organize employee representative conferences and report trade union work and labor-capital consultation meeting work to the representative conferences on time.
　　2. Improve labor protection through production competitions. Trade unions must earnestly care about the safety of the masses and their daily lives. Vigorously promote and supervise administrative or capitalist parties to effectively improve safety devices and labor protection to protect the health of workers and staff. All private factories must improve safety devices, increase the number of lights, and provide sufficient water buckets and toilets in the workshops. Expand nurseries, bathhouses, and barber shops. Improve or expand canteens. Necessary repairs should be made to existing dormitories, windows should be opened for those without windows, gutters should be repaired, and dormitories should be kept clean and hygienic to reduce disease. Active measures should be taken to reduce workshop temperatures and humidity that are too high. We resolutely oppose purely profit-seeking behavior that disregards the lives and safety of workers and staff. If there is an excuse of lack of money and safety devices are not actively improved, and death occurs due to work-related incidents, whether it is a state-owned factory or a private factory, the trade union should publicly criticize in the newspapers and file a lawsuit with the court to protect the lives and safety of workers and staff. State-owned factories should take the lead in improving safety devices and labor protection. Trade unions should regard the improvement of safety devices, labor protection, and safety and hygiene education as their regular and important tasks, promptly put forward positive suggestions for improving labor protection, and organize the masses to supervise the administrative or capitalist parties to do a good job in labor protection, greatly giving play to the production enthusiasm of the masses.
　　In areas where labor insurance has been implemented, this work should be done conscientiously. In areas where labor insurance has not been implemented, in addition to conscientiously supervising administrative or capitalist parties to handle matters in accordance with the original regulations, preparations should be made for the implementation of labor insurance.
　　3. Strengthen educational work. First of all, it is necessary to carry out in-depth education on resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea to defend our homes and country among the workers and staff, give play to the patriotic enthusiasm of the masses, and integrate this enthusiasm with the production competition. Clearly recognize the long-term and comprehensive nature of the competition. Propaganda and mobilization work should be carried out frequently in the competition, disseminating advanced experiences and encouraging the progressive spirit of the masses. The literacy campaign should be vigorously carried out and integrated with the production competition. Spare-time schools should be universally established and improved, and a necessary set of systems should be established to regularize them.
　　Trade unions must overcome the past bias of neglecting the education of staff and female workers. Strengthen the ideological and political education of all workers and staff. Train a large number of worker cadres, promote a large number of workers to leadership organs of trade unions at all levels, strengthen trade union leadership, and prepare to transport cadres to all parties. Criticism and education should be given to all improper styles. Trade unions should become organizations that unite and educate workers and staff.
　　Internationalist education should be carried out in a planned way so that all workers and staff know that our victory is inseparable from the assistance of the world working class, especially the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries. Today, we have won, and we have a responsibility to assist the oppressed working class to gain liberation.
　　4. Adjust unreasonable wages. An unreasonable wage system is the biggest obstacle to the development of production. Trade unions must adapt to the demands of the broad masses, conduct in-depth education to make the masses understand the significance of wage adjustments, and adjust the most unreasonable wages under the current standards to gradually conform to the principle of distribution according to work.
　　5. Establish a financial system. Financial work is an important task in trade union construction, and we must pay attention to it. Establish a necessary financial system, overcome various chaotic phenomena, and implement independent funding. Trade union funds should be truly used for trade union work and on members. It should be ensured that 20% of membership dues are used to take care of members' difficulties and 5% are used for food subsidies for children in nurseries. Trade union committees at all levels must report the income and expenditure of funds to members on time and report to higher levels. Every member has the right to check the expenditure of trade union funds. We call on all members to pay membership dues on time and supervise the expenditure of trade union funds.
　　6. Strengthen the work of female workers and family members. Textile trade unions must not underestimate this work. Otherwise, they will be separated from more than 70% of the masses. Trade union organizations at all levels should specifically study, convey, and implement the resolutions of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions' meeting on women workers' work, and do a good job in the work of female workers and family members. The women workers' department or women workers' committee of the grass-roots and municipal committees should regularly convene meetings of female worker representatives and family members to listen to the opinions of the masses, summarize experiences, and arrange work. The female chairman or female vice-chairman of the grass-roots committee should personally lead the work of the female workers' committee and the family members' committee, and strengthen the leadership of the work of female workers and family members. Improve their political and technical level in a planned way and train a large number of female worker cadres. Organize nursery directors, nannies, doctors, and children's mothers to run nurseries well and reduce infant mortality. The 5% of membership dues for children's food subsidies should be supervised by the mothers for their use.
　　Trade unions are organizations voluntarily joined by the masses. Trade union matters must be handled by the broad masses of members, not by a few people taking over. We call on the broad masses of members to actively participate in trade union work, pool their efforts to do a good job in trade union work, and ensure the completion and overfulfillment of the glorious and arduous production tasks of 1951.

　　中国纺织工会一九五一年的新任务
    中国纺织工会全国委员会主席  陈少敏
    编者按：本文是中国纺织工会全国委员会主席陈少敏同志所作“中国纺织工会一九五一年的新任务”一文中的第四节。全文共四节，第一节为“我们一年来的成就”，第二节为“工人职员艰苦奋斗”，第三节为“我们工作中的缺点”，第四节即为本文“一九五一年的新任务”。全文刊于全国总工会机关报《工人日报》一九五一年一月一、三两日第四版。
    一九五一年的纺织工业生产任务是繁重的，我们号召全体纺织工人、职员发挥最大的积极性和创造性，胜利完成一九五一年的新任务。
    一、展开爱国主义生产竞赛。一九五一年的奋斗目标是提高产量、质量、消灭浪费，减低成本。不论棉、毛、麻、丝、针织、印染、梭管、机械、化工等厂均应为减低成本百分之一至百分之二而奋斗。棉纺织厂争取做到各支纱通扯用棉量不超过四百斤，争取于一九五一年内创造出一个比较科学的生产定额来，并争取十一个月完成十二个月的生产计划。产量最高者创造质量上的新纪录，产量低者应在提高质量、消灭浪费、减低成本的前提下提高产量，适应人民需要。工会干部应学会计算成本，及时公布成绩，巩固和提高群众生产积极性，先进者带动落后者，国营厂带动私营厂，将整个生产水平、工作水平提高一步。从技术上、组织上、思想上打下发展纺织工业的基础。私营厂的工人、职员应该认识搞好私营厂的生产，对整个国家人民对工人阶级是有益处的。将生产搞好了，整个人民和工人阶级生活才可能随着生产的发展而逐步改善。因此，私营厂的工人、职员亦应积极展开生产竞赛，提高产量、质量，消灭浪费，减低成本，在生产上创造新纪录。但是，工会干部必须记住：工会是工人阶级的群众组织，我们是站在工人阶级的立场上，搞好生产，完成国家生产任务，在保护工人阶级利益的前提下去争取、团结资方。任何无原则的迁就、让步都是错误的。
    各地纺织工会组织应根据当地具体情况普遍和行政或资方订立集体合同，分清双方职责，并履行合同所规定事项。
    加强工厂管理委员会和劳资协商会议工作，切实发挥代表会议作用，私营厂工会亦应组织职工代表会议，并按时向代表会议报告工会工作和劳资协商会议工作。
    二、通过生产竞赛，改善劳动保护。工会必须切实关心群众生命安全和日常生活。力促并监督行政或资方切实改善安全装置、劳动保护，保护工人、职员的健康。所有私营厂必须把安全装置搞好，增加灯光支数，车间里必须设置足够的水桶、厕所。扩大托儿所、澡塘、理发室。改善或扩大食堂。原有宿舍应作必要的修理，没有窗子者应开窗子，修理阴沟，保持宿舍清洁卫生，以减少疾病，车间温度、湿度太高者应积极设法减低。我们坚决反对不顾工人、职员生命安全的单纯谋利行为，如借口无钱，不积极改善安全装置，发生因工死人事件时，不论国营厂、私营厂，工会均应在报纸上公开批评并向法院起诉，保障工人、职员生命安全。国营厂在改善安全装置、劳动保护方面应起带头作用。工会应把改善安全装置、劳动保护、安全卫生教育当作自己经常的重要任务，及时提出改善劳动保护的积极意见，并组织群众监督行政或资方办好劳动保护工作，大大发挥群众生产积极性。
    已实行劳动保险的地区，应切实作好这一工作。未实行劳动保险的地区除切实监督行政或资方照原有规定办理外，应作好实行劳动保险的准备工作。
    三、加强教育工作。首先必须在工人、职员群众中进行深入的抗美援朝保家卫国的教育，发挥群众的爱国热情，并使这种热情和生产竞赛结合起来。明确地认识竞赛的长期性和全面性。在竞赛中应经常进行宣传鼓动工作，传播先进经验，鼓舞群众的进取精神。识字运动应大力开展，使之与生产竞赛相结合。业余学校应普遍建立和健全起来，建立一套必要的制度使之正规化。
    工会必须克服过去忽视职员教育和女工教育的偏向。加强全体工人、职员的思想教育、政治教育。培养大批工人干部，大量提拔工人到各级工会领导机关中来，加强工会领导，并准备向各方输送干部。对一切不正派作风，应给以批评和教育。克服各种保守观念。工会应成为团结、教育工人、职员群众的组织。
    有计划地进行国际主义教育，使全体工人、职员知道我们的胜利是与世界工人阶级的援助分不开的，尤其是苏联和新民主主义国家对我们的援助特别重大。今天我们胜利了，我们有责任援助被压迫的工人阶级获得解放。
    四、调整不合理的工资。不合理的工资制度是发展生产的最大障碍，工会必须适应广大群众的要求，进行深入的教育，使群众明了调整工资的意义，在现在的标准下调整最不合理的工资，使之逐渐符合于按劳取酬的原则。
    五、建立财务制度。财务工作是工会建设中的重要工作，我们必须重视。建立必要的财务制度，克服各种混乱现象，实行经费独立。工会的经费，应真正用在工会工作上和会员身上。切实作到会费百分之二十照顾会员困难，百分之五用于托儿所小孩食品补助。工会各级委员会必须按时将经费收支情况向会员作报告，并报告上级。每个会员均有检查工会经费开支的权利。我们号召全体会员按时交纳会费，并监督工会经费的开支。
    六、加强女工工作和家属工作。纺织工会绝不能轻视这一工作。否则就要脱离百分之七十以上的群众。各级工会组织要具体地研究、传达和执行全总女工工作会议的决议，作好女工工作和家属工作。基层和市委员会女工部或女工委员会应经常召开女工代表会议、家属会议，听取群众意见，总结经验和布置工作。基层委员会女主席或女副主席应亲自领导女工委员会和家属委员会工作，加强女工和家属工作的领导。有计划地提高她们的政治和技术水平，培养大批女工干部。组织托儿所所长、褓姆、医生和孩子的母亲办好托儿所，减少婴儿死亡率。会费百分之五的小儿食品补助费，应由母亲们监督其使用。
    工会是群众自愿结合的组织，工会的事项必须是广大会员群众来办，不能由少数人包办代替。我们号召广大会员群众积极参加工会工作，群策群力办好工会工作，保证完成并超过一九五一年光荣而繁重的生产任务。
