I Love New Beijing
Lao She

Beijing is beautiful. I know this, not only because I am a Beijinger, but also because I have been to Europe and America and seen many famous Western cities. If I were to praise Beijing solely on the basis of being a Beijinger, it might just be prejudice.

I know Beijing is beautiful, and I love her like I love my mother. Because I love her so much, I am concerned and saddened by her shortcomings. I care about her defects just as I care about the illnesses of a loved one. Yes, Beijing does have shortcomings. Those shortcomings were brought to Beijing by the emperors, warlords, and the Kuomintang government of the past. They occupied Beijing and also trampled on her.

In the past, for example, when the emperor or Chiang Kai-shek came out, the streets were cleaned and sprinkled with water; however, the places their sedan chairs or cars didn't pass never saw a broom or bucket. High officials and nobles lived in palace-like houses with beautiful gardens; the poor lived in the dirtiest, most crowded courtyards. Outside the gates of the high officials were asphalt roads for their cars to speed on; in front of the poor people's doors were piles of garbage.

At the end of 1949, I returned to my hometown of Beijing. I hadn't been back for fourteen years. Although I had been away for so long, I never stopped thinking about her for a single day. No matter where I was, I still used Beijing as the background for my novels, because the Beijing I imagined with my eyes closed was more intimate, more real, and more emotional than the place I saw with my eyes open. This is the truth.

Today, I have lived in Beijing for a year. In this year, everything I have seen and heard has proven that the new government truly relies on the people and is all for the people. Just in terms of Beijing's construction, the evidence is already ample. Let us put forward a few items:

(1) Sewers: Beijing's sewers had been in disrepair for many years. Whenever it rained heavily, it lived up to that unseemly saying: "Beijing, when the wind blows, it's an incense burner; when it rains, it's an ink box." Since its establishment, the Beijing People's Government has been determined to wash away this stain left by the reactionary government, repairing roads and digging ditches. I know that after more than ten years of the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation, the government's financial resources were not very plentiful when everything was waiting to be done. However, for the welfare of the people, the government did not delay this important task due to economic difficulties. The underground sewers in all the cities have been dug, and rainwater and sewage have channels to drain away. Beijing is no longer afraid of rain; rain no longer turns the roads into ink boxes.

What moves me most is that this government, which serves the people, does not only repair ditches for the main roads, but also first considers the remote places that have always been neglected by the reactionary government. In the past, the reactionary government sucked the blood of the people and dumped sewage and garbage outside the doors of the poor, teaching them to "enjoy" the life of pigs and dogs. Now, the government sees where it is the dirtiest and where there are the most diseases, and starts the repairs from there first; the new government's eyes are on the poor and suffering people.

In the southern part of Beijing, there is an open ditch called Dragon Beard Ditch. What a beautiful name, Dragon Beard Ditch! However, in reality, it was the stinkiest ditch. The two banks of the ditch were densely packed with working people, breathing in the nauseating stench all year round. For many years, no one had repaired this ditch because it was a slum. The people repeatedly donated money to repair the ditch on their own initiative, but the money was swallowed up by the reactionary officials. Last summer, the People's Government built underground sewers for the people next to the open ditch, and they were completed in the autumn; the open ditch was filled in. The people's gratitude can be imagined. I personally went to see this stinking "Dragon Beard" and the new underground sewers, and collected information about the lives of the people in that area, and their reaction to the government's repair of the ditch for them, and wrote a three-act play to express my gratitude and admiration to the government. This play may be performed on the second anniversary of the liberation of Beijing.

(2) Cleanliness: Beijing has always been beautiful, but under the reactionary government, it was not clean everywhere. Yes, at that time, the people did pay sanitation fees on time, but because of the corruption and irresponsibility of the officials, the sanitation fees were not necessarily used for public health matters. Now, Beijing is like an old and beautiful carved lacquer box, falling into the hands of a diligent person, every concavity on the box is cleaned up, and there is no more accumulation of dirt. Really, every alley in Beijing has been cleaned up, and even people's courtyards have no accumulated garbage, because the personnel who dump the filth are so diligent and always come so punctually, that people are willing to clean up their courtyards and outside their courtyards every day. Beauty is inseparable from cleanliness. In the past, I was already proud of Beijing's beauty, but now I have more pride, look, how clean and lovely this people's ancient city is! I can imagine that in ten or eight years, the whole city of Beijing will become a large park, beautiful everywhere, clean everywhere, with historical sites everywhere, and also with the latest sanitary facilities everywhere.

(3) Lights and Water: Beijing, before liberation, was often dark at night. She had electric lights, but the light was so weak that it seemed to be there and not there. Moreover, there were frequent and long-lasting power outages. The darkness of politics made the electric lights also dim. At that time, the water was also like that: in the summer, the water source dried up, and there was no water to use; even on weekdays, the powerful used water desperately, and the areas where the poor lived had no tap water pipes at all. They had to drink well water. This seven-hundred-year-old city, under the rule of the reactionary government, the supply of lights and water seemed to still be stuck in the state of affairs seven centuries ago.

Beijing has been liberated, and people's hearts and eyes have seen the light together. Beijing's electric lights, due to the new management methods of the power plant, and due to the progress and efforts of the workers, are truly like electric lights. The workers guarantee that there will be no power shortages and no power outages. This ancient capital, in the darkness of night, still reveals her beauty. The golden and green glazed tiles, the red walls, and the white jade stone bridges all show the most pleasing colors under the bright lights. Moreover, there is enough electricity to supply the factories, so Beijing can also produce! Similarly, there is enough water to use. And even the people living in Dragon Beard Ditch have tap water to drink.

I love Beijing, and I love today's Beijing even more - she is so clean, bright, and beautiful! How can I not thank Chairman Mao? It is he who brought light to Beijing, and countless benefits! I only mentioned the sewers and lights and water, but my gratitude is endless, because what I have mentioned here is only a part of the construction work of New Beijing.

### 我热爱新北京

　　我热爱新北京
    老舍
    北京是美丽的。我知道，因为我不单是北京人，而且到过欧美，看见过许多西方的名城。假若我只用北京人的资格去赞美北京，那也许就是成见了。
    我知道北京美丽，我爱她像爱我的母亲。因为我这么爱她，所以才为她的缺点着急，苦闷。我关切她的缺欠正像关切一个亲人的疾病。是的，北京确是有缺欠。那些缺欠是过去的皇帝、军阀与国民党政府带给北京的。他们占据着北京，也糟踏北京。
    在过去，举例说吧，当皇帝或蒋介石出来的时候，街道上便打扫干净，洒上清水；可是，他们的大轿或汽车不经过的地方便永远没见过扫帚与水桶。达官贵人住着宫殿式的房子，而且有美丽的花园；穷人们却住着顶脏的杂院儿。达官贵人的门外有柏油路，以便疾驶他们的汽车；穷人的门前却是垃圾堆。
    一九四九年年尾，我回到故乡北京。我已经十四年没回来过了。虽然别离了这么久，我可是没有一天不想念着她。不管我在哪里，我还是拿北京作我的小说的背景，因为我闭上眼想起的北京，是要比睁着眼看见的地方，更亲切，更真实，更有感情的。这是真话。
    到今天，我已在北京住了一年。在这一年里，我所看到听到的都证明了，新的政府千真万确是一切仰仗人民，一切为了人民的。只就北京的建设来说，证据已经十分充足了。让我们提出几项来说吧：
    （一）下水道：北京的下水道已年久失修，每逢一下大雨，就应了那句不体面的话：“北京，刮风是香炉，下雨是墨盒子。”北京人民政府自从一成立就要洗刷这个由反动政府留下的污点，一方面修路，一方面挖沟。我知道，在十几年抗日与解放战争之后，百废待举的时候，政府的财力是不怎么从容的。可是，政府为了人民的福利，并不因经济的困难而延迟这重大的任务。各城的暗沟都挖了，雨水污水都有了宣泄的路子。北京不再怕下雨；下雨不再使道路成为墨盒子。
    最使我感动的是：这个为人民服务的政府并不只为通衢大路修沟，而是也首先顾到一向被反动政府所忽视的偏僻的地方。在以前，反动政府是吸去人民的血，而把污水和垃圾倾倒在穷人的门外，教他们“享受”猪狗的生活。现在，政府是看哪里最脏，疾病最多，便先从哪里动手修整；新政府的眼是看着穷苦人民的。
    在北京的南城，有一条明沟，叫作龙须沟。多么美的名子啊，龙须沟！可是，实际上，那是一条最臭的水沟。沟的两岸密匝匝地住满了劳苦的人民，终年呼吸着使人恶心的臭气。多少年了，这条沟没有人修理过，因为这里是贫民窟。人民屡次自动地捐款修沟，款子却被反动的官吏们吞吃了。去年夏初，人民政府在明沟的旁边给人民修了暗沟，秋天完工；填平了明沟。人民怎样的感戴是可以想像到的。我亲自去看过这条奇臭的“龙须”，和那新的暗沟，并且搜集了那一带人民的生活情形，与他们对政府给他们修沟的反映，写成一出三幕话剧，表示我对政府的感激与钦佩。这话剧或者将在北京解放二周年纪念日演出。
    （二）清洁：北京向来是美丽的，可是在反动政府下并不处处都清洁。是的，那时候人民确是按期交卫生费的，但是因为官吏的贪污与不负责，卫生费并不见得用在公众卫生事宜上。现在，北京像一座古老美丽的雕花漆盒，落在一个勤黾的人的手里，盒上的每一凹处都收拾得干干净净，再没有一点积垢。真的，北京的每一条小巷都已清清爽爽，连人家的院内也没有积累的垃圾，因为倾倒秽土的人员是那么勤谨，那么准时必来，使人们都愿意逐日把院里和院外收拾清楚。美丽是与清洁分不开的。以前，只为北京的美丽我已感到骄傲，现在我又多了一分骄傲，看，这人民的古城也多么清爽可喜啊！我可以想像到，在十年八年以后，北京的全城会成为一座大的公园，处处美丽，处处清洁，处处有古迹，处处也有最新的卫生设备。
    （三）灯水：北京，在解放前，夜里常是黑暗的。她有电灯，但灯光是那么微弱，以至于似有若无。而且，时时长时间的停电。政治的黑暗，使电灯也无光。那时候，水也是那样：夏天水源枯竭，便没有水用；即在平日，也是有势力的拚命用水，穷人住的地带根本没有自来水管。他们须喝井水。这七百年的古城，在反动政府的统治下，灯水的供应似乎还停留在七世纪前的光景。
    北京解放了，人的心与人的眼一齐见到光明。北京的电灯，由于电厂有了新的管理法，由于工人的进步与努力，真像电灯了。工人们保证不缺电，不停电。这古老的都城，在黑夜间，依然露出她的美丽。那金的绿的琉璃瓦，红的墙，白玉石的桥，都在明亮的灯光下，显现出最悦目的颜色。而且，电力还够供给各工厂的，使北京也会生产啊！同样的，水也够用了。而且就是住在龙须沟的人们也有了自来水吃啊。
    我爱北京，我更爱今天的北京——她是多么清洁，明亮，美丽！我怎能不感谢毛主席呢？是他，给北京带来了光明，和说不尽的好处啊！我只提到下水道与灯水什么的，可是我的感激是无尽的，因为我在这里所提到的不过是新北京建设工作的一部分啊。
