    Many People are Now Listening to the Radio

    In Chengguan District, Zhaodong County, Heilongjiang Province, thousands of people can now listen to the radio every day. This is the result of the active work of the Cultural Center Radio Station in the county's urban area. They started building the radio station in the spring of 1947, and by the end of last year, they had developed 441 households with loudspeakers, with a basic audience of 2,500 people. The distribution of loudspeakers is quite widespread, from shops on the main street to residents in remote alleys, with an average of one loudspeaker for each citizen group. The method of listening to the radio is that the Cultural Center Radio Station uses a radio to receive news and then broadcasts it to each listening household using an amplifier. In addition to relaying news from the Central People's Broadcasting Station and radio stations in nearby major cities, the content of the broadcast also includes one hour of local news every day, including various notices from the local government, current affairs learning materials, and health knowledge. During the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, radio propaganda was carried out based on the ideological situation of the local people, and the masses were educated through various forms. For example, broadcasting current affairs Q&A, exposing rumors with clapper talks, short plays, and crosstalk, which played a significant role in the ideological education of the masses. Citizens who have listened to current affairs broadcasts understand that "the Chinese and Korean people are of one heart" and "we cannot live a good life without eliminating the American imperialists." Many local people have come to regard listening to the radio as an important way to understand current affairs, learn, and entertain themselves. Some people say, "If the loudspeaker doesn't sound on time, it feels like something is missing." Sometimes, if they don't understand after listening to the broadcast, they run to the cultural center to inquire.

　　黑龙江省肇东县城关区
    很多群众都听上广播了
    黑龙江省肇东县城关区，现在有数千群众每天都能收听广播了。这是该县城区文化馆广播站积极工作的结果。他们从一九四七年春开始建广播站，到去年年底，已经发展了四百四十一家按有扩音喇叭的听户，基本听众有二千五百人。扩音喇叭的分布是相当普遍的，从大街的商铺到偏僻小巷的住户，平均每个市民小组有一个喇叭。收听广播的方法，是由文化馆广播站用收音机收听到消息以后再用扩大器播送到各听户。广播的内容，每天除转播中央人民广播电台及附近大城市的广播电台的消息外，还广播一个钟头的地方消息，其中包括当地政府的各项通知、时事学习材料及卫生常识等。在抗美援朝运动中，曾根据当地群众思想情况，进行广播宣传，通过各种形式教育群众。如播送时事问答、揭穿谣言快板、短剧、相声等，对群众思想教育起了很大的作用。听过时事广播的市民都懂得了“中朝人民是心连心”、“不消灭美帝不能过好日子”等。当地很多群众已经把听广播当作了解时事、进行学习和娱乐的重要方式，有的群众说：“播音喇叭到时不响，心里就像少了点啥。”有时广播后没听懂，便跑到文化馆来打听。
