Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 16th. The Propaganda Department of the Northeast Bureau of the CCP Central Committee convened the first regional Propaganda Cadre Representative Meeting from the 8th to the 12th of this month. Participating in the meeting were representatives of propaganda cadres from factories, rural areas, cities, and various levels of the New Democratic Youth League organizations, as well as propaganda cadres from the Party committees of various provinces and counties. Based on the CCP Central Committee's decision to establish a propaganda network for the masses of the people throughout the Party, the meeting discussed the achievements, experiences, and shortcomings in establishing propaganda cadre work in various parts of Northeast China since May of last year, and made decisions on how to further consolidate and develop the propaganda cadre organization in the future.

　　At the meeting, Fu Zhensheng, Director of the Propaganda Department of the Northeast Bureau, reported on the initial achievements and experiences of carrying out current affairs propaganda in various parts of Northeast China in recent months. He pointed out that the main reason for the great achievements in launching the Resist America, Aid Korea, Defend the Homeland movement in the Northeast was the large-scale propaganda work carried out in factories, cities, and rural areas. More than 117,000 propaganda cadres developed in the Northeast region under the leadership of the CCP committees at all levels played a significant role in this movement. Through this movement, not only has the political consciousness of the broad masses of people been raised and a surging patriotic upsurge has been aroused, but it has also initially changed the coercive command style and purely task-oriented viewpoints of some cadres (especially rural cadres), and smoothly promoted various tasks. He also pointed out that the shortcomings of past propaganda work were that it was not persistent, regular, or extensive and in-depth enough; and the content and methods of propaganda still had the problems of generalization and formalism. These shortcomings need to be corrected in future work. During the meeting, seventeen propaganda cadre representatives, including Xu Chenglin, reported on typical experiences in propaganda work.

　　In order to implement the decision of the CCP Central Committee, the meeting determined the guiding principles for establishing a propaganda network based on the current situation of propaganda work in various parts of Northeast China: (1) In areas where propaganda cadre organizations have already been established and have achieved initial results, they should be consolidated and improved in the future, and appropriately reorganized and developed on the basis of consolidation; (2) In areas where propaganda work has a foundation but propaganda cadre organizations have not yet been established, efforts should be focused on establishing organizations, and the CCP party branches should strengthen leadership and establish necessary systems; (3) In areas where the foundation of propaganda work is relatively weak and organizations have not yet been established, efforts should be made to establish and develop propaganda cadre organizations on a trial basis. In cities, CCP members, Youth League members, and activists among the masses in organizations and groups can be mobilized to participate in propaganda work, and street propaganda cadre organizations can be gradually established. In rural areas, the current focus is on absorbing district and village cadres and primary school teachers to participate, and then gradually promote it.

　　贯彻执行中共中央建立宣传网的决定
    东北召开宣传员代表会
    决定进一步巩固与发展宣传员组织
    【新华社沈阳十六日电】中共中央东北局宣传部于本月八日至十二日召开全区首届宣传员代表会议。参加会议的有各工厂、农村、城市和新民主主义青年团各级组织的宣传员代表及各省、县党委会宣传干部。会议根据中共中央关于在全党建立对人民群众的宣传网的决定，讨论了自去年五月以来东北各地建立宣传员工作的成绩、经验和存在的缺点，并对今后如何进一步巩固与发展宣传员组织作了决定。
    会上东北局宣传处处长富振声报告了数月来东北各地开展时事宣传的初步成绩和经验。他指出东北开展抗美援朝保家卫国运动获得巨大成就的主要原因是在工厂、城市和农村中展开了大规模的宣传工作。东北区在各级中共党委领导下发展起来的十一万七千余名宣传员，在这一运动中起了很大的作用。通过这一运动，不仅提高了广大人民的政治觉悟，激起了汹涌澎湃的爱国主义高潮，并初步改变了若干干部（特别是农村干部）的强迫命令作风和单纯任务观点，顺利地推动了各种工作。他并指出过去宣传工作的缺点是不够持久、经常和广泛深入；宣传的内容和方法还存在着一般化和形式主义的毛病。这些缺点都需要在今后工作中纠正。会议期间，宣传员代表许成林等十七人并作了宣传工作典型经验的报告。
    会议为贯彻中共中央的决定，根据目前东北各地宣传工作开展的情况，确定了建立宣传网的方针：（一）在已经建立宣传员组织并有初步成绩的地区，今后应加以巩固和提高，在巩固的基础上适当地进行整理与发展；（二）在宣传工作已有基础但宣传员组织尚未建立的地区，应着重建立组织，中共党支部应加强领导，并建立必要的制度；（三）宣传工作基础比较薄弱，还没有建立组织的地区，应试行建立与发展宣传员组织。在城市中可发动机关团体中的中共党员、青年团员和群众中的积极分子，参加宣传工作，逐步建立街道宣传员组织。在农村中目前主要是吸收区村干部、小学教员参加，然后逐步推广。
