　　Wang Zheliang from Beijing Writes:
    Red Lights Should Be Installed at Night at Sewer Repair Sites
    In front of the Jinghua Rubber Factory at No. 81 Jiugulou Dajie in this city, two very deep pits have been dug for repairing underground sewers, but no red lights or other signs have been set up at night. On the night of January 13th, Wang Shiqing, a worker from the factory, fell into the pit, bled a lot, and immediately lost consciousness. Therefore, I hope that the relevant authorities will pay close attention to this issue to avoid danger to pedestrians.
    Editor's Note: Wang Zheliang's suggestion is very correct. Beijing is repairing sewers, and deep pits have been dug in many places. To draw the attention of pedestrians at night and avoid accidents, the engineering department should install red lights everywhere.

### 京市王哲良来信：修下水道处夜间应设红灯

　　京市王哲良来信：
    修下水道处夜间应设红灯
    本市旧鼓楼大街八十一号京华橡胶厂门前，因整修地下水道，挖了两个很深的坑子，但夜间没有设红灯等标志。一月十三日夜，该厂工人王世清就掉进坑去，流血很多，当即失去知觉。因此，我希望有关机关要很好的注意这个问题，以免行人发生危险。
    编者按：王哲良的建议很对。京市正在整修下水道，许多地方都挖有深坑，为引起夜间行人注意，免生意外，工程处应普设红灯。
