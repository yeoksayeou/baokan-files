Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 16th TASS dispatch: Today's *Pravda* published an editorial entitled "A Major Guarantee for Consolidation and Lasting Peace," excerpting: The American imperialists, not accepting the lessons of the failure of their adventurous plans in Korea, are exhausting all efforts to establish new bases for armed adventure. The bloody plans of the instigators of another world war are linked to the restoration of German and Japanese imperialism. Therefore, opposing the remilitarization of West Germany is currently one of the major tasks of peace-loving people of all countries.

The Soviet Union, pursuing a consistent policy of peace, has always insisted, and still insists, on strictly and steadfastly adhering to the Potsdam Agreement, eradicating German militarism, and democratizing Germany.

*Pravda* reiterated that because the Soviet policy is in line with the vital interests of peace-loving people of all countries worldwide, this policy has won the wholehearted approval of peace-loving people of all countries worldwide. The paper stated: The issue of eliminating German imperialism's war and industrial potential and the issue of German democratization are of urgent importance for Europe, and of utmost importance for the peace and security of all countries.

The German people, who are fighting for the establishment of a unified, peace-loving, and democratic Germany, are also extremely concerned about the eradication of fascist remnants, and concerned about the democratization and demilitarization of Germany.

In a very short period of time, the German Democratic Republic has achieved tremendous achievements in strengthening the foundation of a peace-loving, independent, and democratic German state. The German Democratic Republic stands firmly on the side of the peace camp led by the Soviet Union, and actively struggles against the conspiracies of American and British imperialists. The German people's struggle against the instigators of a new war is now developing into an increasingly important factor for European peace.

*Pravda* continued: Peace-loving people of all countries worldwide are cheering the initial victories of the young German Democratic Republic, and are trying to actively support it. In all countries worldwide, good people are deeply aware of the fact that the progressive forces of the German people are laying the foundation for a unified, democratic, and peace-loving Germany, thereby making a great contribution to the cause of achieving consolidated peace throughout Europe.

The Soviet Union, following the principles of maintaining peace and security in Europe, insists on the immediate conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany.

*Pravda* continued: Contrary to the Soviet policy, the ruling groups of the United States and Britain regard the remilitarization of West Germany as the center of their European policy. All their efforts are aimed at turning the monopolists of the Ruhr into their main allies and supporters for implementing the aggressive plans of the North Atlantic bloc. The American and British warmongers have already grossly violated the Potsdam Agreement, trampled on the vital interests of the people of Europe, and disregarded the peace-seeking German people. Now they are madly rebuilding West German imperialism's industrial and war base, and reviving the German fascist army.

In view of the danger of German aggression recurring, the urgent task of peace-loving people should be to resolutely oppose the evil plans and conspiracies of those instigators of a new war.

*Pravda* pointed out that the appeal of the World Peace Congress has received widespread support, and the proposals of the Prague Conference of the Eight Foreign Ministers, aimed at an early peace treaty with Germany and the realization of German democratization, have also been widely supported. The paper then said that the warmongers' Brussels Treaty is aimed at rapidly establishing a West German revanchist army and making them play a decisive role in the military forces of the North Atlantic aggressive bloc, yet freedom-loving people deeply resent this.

A broad section of the German people are increasingly clearly aware that the interests of the German people require the termination of German remilitarization, and the establishment of a unified, peace-loving, independent, and democratic Germany. Therefore, the proposals of the Prague Conference of the Eight Foreign Ministers, and the call of Prime Minister Grotewohl of the German Democratic Republic for the unification of all of Germany, have received great sympathy from the people of West Germany.

*Pravda* concluded by saying that mobilizing the people to fight against the revival of retaliatory German imperialism is the most important combative task of peace fighters. This struggle is entering a decisive stage. There is no doubt that millions of peace fighters will wage the struggle with greater energy and tenacity against the bloody plans of the American and British instigators of a new war, and for lasting peace in Europe and the world.

　　真理报社论
    “巩固与持久和平的重大保证”
    ——评各国人民反对西德重新军事化
    塔斯社莫斯科十六日电：今日真理报以《巩固与持久和平的重大保证》为题发表社论，略称：美帝国主义者们不接受其冒险计划在朝鲜遭到失败的教训，而正竭尽全力建立新的武装冒险的基地。另一次大战的制造者们的血腥计划是与恢复德日帝国主义一事联结在一起的。因此，反对使西德重新军事化目前便是各国爱好和平人民的重大任务之一。
    奉行着始终不渝的和平政策的苏联，一直都坚持主张，而且现在仍主张严格地、坚定不移地遵守波茨坦协定，肃清德国的军国主义，使德国民主化。
    真理报再度强调，因为苏联的政策符合全世界爱好和平的各国人民的切身利益，因此这个政策获得了全世界爱好和平的各国人民全心全意的赞同。该报称：消灭德国帝国主义的战争和工业潜力的问题和德国民主化的问题对于欧洲具有迫切的紧急性，对所有国家的和平与安全，具有绝大的重要性。
    正在为建立统一的爱好和平的民主德国而斗争的德国人民也极端关切法西斯残余的铲除，关切德国的民主化和非军国主义化。
    仅在很短的时间内，德意志民主共和国在加强爱好和平的、独立的、民主的德国国家基础方面，已经获得了巨大的成就。德意志民主共和国坚定地站在以苏联为首的和平阵营一边，对美英帝国主义者的阴谋进行积极斗争。德国人民反对新战争挑拨者的斗争现在正在发展成为欧洲和平的愈来愈重要的因素。
    真理报继称：全世界各国爱好和平的人民都为年青的德意志民主共和国的初步胜利而欢呼，并且都设法积极地支持它。在全世界各国，善良的人民都深知一个事实，即德国人民的进步力量正在为统一的、民主的、爱好和平的德国奠定基础，从而也就正在对全欧获致巩固的和平的事业提供了伟大的贡献。
    苏联遵循着保持欧洲和平与安全的原则，坚持毫不延宕地缔结对德和约。
    真理报继称：和苏联的政策相反，美国和英国的统治集团把西德重新军事化作为它们的欧洲政策的中心。他们的一切努力都是为着变鲁尔的垄断大亨们为他们实现北大西洋集团侵略计划的主要盟友和支持者。美英战争贩子们已经粗暴地破坏了波茨坦协定，蹂躏着欧洲各国人民的切身利益，并且毫不理会力求和平的德国人民，现在他们正在疯狂地重建西德帝国主义的工业与战争基地，并且复活德国的法西斯军队。
    鉴于德国侵略有再度发生的危险，爱好和平的人民的紧迫任务应该是坚决地反对那些新战争挑拨者的罪恶计划与阴谋。
    真理报指出，世界和平大会的呼吁获得了广泛的支持，同时目的在早日对德媾和并实现德国民主化的八国外长布拉格会议建议，也受到广泛的拥护。接着该报说，战争贩子们的布鲁塞尔条约要迅速建立西德复仇主义的军队，并使他们在北大西洋侵略集团的军事力量中起决定性的作用，然而爱好自由的人民对此深感痛恨。
    广大阶层的德国人民愈来愈清楚地了解到德国人民的利益要求终止德国重新军事化，要求建立统一、爱好和平、独立和民主的德国。因此，八国外长布拉格会议的建议，以及德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥要求统一全德国的号召，得到了西德人民的极大同情。
    真理报最后说，发动人民进行斗争，反对报复性的德国帝国主义复活，是和平战士们最重大的战斗性任务。这一斗争正在进入决定性的阶段。毫无疑问，千百万和平战士将以更大的精力和韧性进行斗争，反对美英新战争挑拨者的血腥计划，争取欧洲和全世界的持久和平。
