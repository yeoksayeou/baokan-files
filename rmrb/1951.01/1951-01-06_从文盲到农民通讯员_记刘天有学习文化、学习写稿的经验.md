From Illiterate to Farmer Correspondent
    ——On Liu Tianyou's Experience in Learning to Read and Write
   Lu Liu, Zhong Qi, Liu Shi, Qing Kun
    After the National Journalism Conference in April 1950, the News Administration's "Decision on Improving Newspaper Work" clearly pointed out: "The newspaper's correspondent network should be based primarily on active elements among the people. In addition to active workers and peasants, active staff members from government organs and progressive intellectuals should also be absorbed." Based on the above spirit, the Jiangning County Party Committee in Jiangsu Province, building on the county's original correspondence work, began to cultivate worker-peasant correspondents, one of whom was Liu Tianyou, a county-level model worker. Comrade Liu Tianyou is already an active farmer correspondent for the Southern Jiangsu Daily.

            What kind of person is Liu Tianyou?

    Before liberation, Liu Tianyou was a farmhand. Originally from Dingyuan County, Anhui, he is 35 years old this year. At the age of eleven, he fled famine to Huangnitang Village in Jiangning, initially herding cattle for the landlord Yi Bingsen. As he grew older, he became a long-term laborer, and later rented more than two mu of land from the landlord Chen Yishou, gradually increasing it to more than ten mu. He suffered deeply from the feudal exploitation and cruel oppression of the landlord class. After liberation, he first joined the farmers' association. Through class grievance sessions and the Party's political education, his level of awareness gradually increased. He mobilized the peasants in the village to launch a reasoned struggle against the landlords and bullies, reducing and recovering more than 20,000 jin of rent rice. During the spring famine this year, under the leadership of the people's government, he mobilized the masses to produce and provide disaster relief, safely weathering the spring famine. In the summer, he repaired the dike, completing the "Village Front Great Dike" in four days, so that not a single mu of land in the village was flooded (last year, 600 mu were flooded). When the production season arrived, he led everyone in implementing the superior's production policy of "not leaving a mu of land uncultivated," ensuring a bumper autumn harvest for the entire village, increasing grain production by 250,000 jin compared to last year. In the various movements over the past year or so, Liu Tianyou has always united the peasant masses to complete the tasks of each central work, deeply winning the love of the peasants in the whole village, the whole district, and the whole county. In July, at the Second Farmers' Representative Conference of Jiangning County, he was elected as a county-level model worker.

            Can illiteracy be blamed on parents?

    After Liu Tianyou joined the farmers' association, he felt most distressed by his illiteracy during the anti-hegemony, rent reduction, and production processes. For example, when calculating rent reductions, he could not write or calculate. He wanted to find the three literate people in the village (two puppet Bao chiefs, one puppet town chief), but he was afraid that they would play tricks and that the masses would reflect that his position was unstable. When draining water and repairing the dike, he took the lead in borrowing many waterwheels. In order to avoid confusion, he wanted to write the names of each household on them as a marker, but he could not write himself. He felt he had no one to whom he could express his bitterness. He blamed his parents for not sending him to school when he was young.

    Based on the above ideological situation, the local leadership first conducted cultural grievance education for him, pointing out that the reason why poor people are illiterate and have no culture is because the old social system was unreasonable. By tracing the roots, investigating the roots, and recalling the past life of herding cattle and working as a long-term laborer, a comparison was made with the landlords' lives of "being full all day long and doing nothing," so that he understood that not being able to study when he was young could not be blamed on his parents, but should be blamed on the landlord class. He said: "The children of landlords went to school at the age of seven or eight, and I was herding cattle for them; when I was seventeen or eighteen, I was a long-term laborer, and their children were already in middle school." After cultural grievance sessions, Liu Tianyou's political awareness was raised.

            How to solve the difficulties of learning culture?

    After Liu Tianyou's awareness was raised, he demanded to learn culture. He deeply realized the importance of culture for life and work. If he did not learn culture, he would encounter many difficulties in his work. He began to talk to leading cadres. The leading cadres tried their best to encourage his learning enthusiasm, telling him many vivid stories of diligent study in Chinese history, and pointing out that after the people in the old liberated areas turned over, they actively participated in literacy classes and winter schools, and could read newspapers and write letters in less than half a year. These practical examples gave him a great influence and improved his enthusiasm for learning culture.

    At first, Liu Tianyou felt that literacy was very difficult. He reflected to the leadership: Reading is a matter of childhood. Now that he is older, his brain is stupid and it is not easy to learn well. He committed an acute illness and wanted to learn everything well at once. The leading comrades explained to him the principle that "as long as you put in the effort, you can grind an iron ruler into a needle." For example, if you recognize one character every day, you can recognize 360 characters in a year, and more than 700 characters in two years. If you learn more slowly, you will use them. At the same time, he also taught him some basic learning methods, asking him to write and read when he was free, and to ask others humbly when he did not recognize a character. He started by learning easily remembered characters and words such as "Liu Tianyou," "Huangnitang," "Communist Party," and "People's Government," and then slowly reading them into lines, paragraphs, and articles of popular text.

    In order to specifically help him learn, the comrades in the district would find him to study together during study time. The materials were mainly the Southern Jiangsu Daily. Others read, and he followed, until there were no new words. In this way, reading a paragraph every day, Lao Liu gradually recognized many characters, developed a feeling for learning, and developed a habit of learning.

    The leadership checked his learning achievements on schedule, and promptly praised his good and active side, and criticized his shortcomings and mistakes. At first, he had concerns in his mind. He loved face and was afraid that others would laugh at him for not learning well. He was unwilling for the leadership to check and supervise. Later, persuasive education was conducted, pointing out to him that everyone is the same in learning, and everyone has to work hard. Just like planting rice seedlings, when you first learn, you can't plant them straight, plant them quickly, or plant them well. Only slowly will you become skilled. Learning culture is the same. It is not something you know when you come out of your mother's womb, but something that gradually improves. After this constant education, the idea of loving face was basically dispelled. He asked others for advice everywhere. His progress in the past year has been rapid.

    He studied the newspaper every day, and when he saw news about the production situation in Huangnitang Village and the production plans they had made together, he was very happy. The leadership immediately seized this opportunity to tell him that the people's newspaper is the mouthpiece of the people, representing the interests of the people, and is fundamentally different from the newspapers of the reactionaries; and told him that Chairman Mao's cultural policy is to serve workers, peasants, and soldiers, stimulating his enthusiasm for writing for the newspaper.

            I want to write, but I have ideological concerns

    Writing for a newspaper is indeed quite difficult for a peasant who has just learned to read and write. Whenever he saw news about Huangnitang Village in the newspaper, he always felt itchy in his heart, wanting to write, but was afraid that he could not do it. In the past, when the reactionaries were here, those who dabbled in writing were all skilled, such as Chen Yishou (landlord), Kuang Zheng (a big bully in Jiangning County, who has been executed), etc. As for himself, he was just a rough old man, afraid that he would not write well and that his superiors would laugh at him. He wanted to write several times, but did not dare to take the plunge.

    Lu Liu, the comrade in charge of correspondence work in the Jiangning County Party Committee, understood this situation and explained to Liu Tianyou: "Today, the Communist Party and the People's Government know the suffering of our poor people without culture. If you don't write well, your superiors will not laugh at you, but will help you and improve your cultural level." Then, he told him that the people's newspaper is the mouthpiece of the people, and you can write about the suffering of the poor people oppressed by the landlords and publish it in the newspaper. At the same time, you can also report the production situation in Huangnitang Village led by you to the outside world for the understanding of superiors and neighboring areas. The county party committee leadership appointed Comrades Shi Chengren and Liu Shi to be responsible for helping him overcome the difficulties of writing; the district also appointed Zhang Shengde (elementary school teacher), director of the Dongshan Town Club, to specifically help him. First, Liu Tianyou dictated and Zhang took notes for him; in the second stage, Lao Liu wrote it himself, and then Zhang corrected the wrong words and smoothed out the sentences for him; later, he collected materials himself and wrote it himself. Thanks to his own continuous efforts and the specific help of others, Comrade Liu Tianyou is progressing rapidly. Zhang Shengde, seeing that he was progressing so quickly, also improved his confidence in writing. He said: "I really admire Liu Tianyou. When he has materials, he picks up his pen and writes. This spirit of learning culture and learning to write really makes us intellectuals admire him."

    Through such specific and meticulous help, Comrade Lao Liu's ideological concerns were completely dispelled, and he began to write for the newspaper!

            What to write? How to write?

    In early September of the same year, Comrade Liu Tianyou went to Southern Jiangsu to attend the Farmers' Representative Conference, and the comrades of the newspaper office asked him to write a production article. After returning home, he saw the scene of Huangnitang's bumper harvest and thought that it could be reported to the outside world. With the help of others, after he determined the central content of the article, he first convened a meeting of village farmers' association members, administrative committee members, farmer representatives, and resident group leaders to understand and investigate this year's autumn harvest yield, and calculated the minimum and maximum yield per mu, as well as a comparison of the total income of the two years. Everyone agreed that this year's output increased by 70% compared with last year, so he asked everyone why this year's output was more than last year, and asked everyone to talk in detail about the root causes at the meeting. As a result, the masses opened up their hearts and unanimously recognized that this was because the Communist Party Chairman Mao came and led everyone to organize and unite to overcome the disaster before there was such a harvest. Liu Tianyou took this opportunity to call on everyone to strengthen the militia organization, defend production, and defend the autumn harvest. All the villagers unanimously agreed with his opinion. After such detailed and in-depth interviews, after finding the materials, he boldly picked up the pen and wrote.

    When he started writing, he encountered difficulties again, because he wanted to include all the problems in the village, and what he wrote was messy and long. The leadership told him that this way of writing was not appropriate, and he became anxious and said, "I won't write anymore. Let me report the work to the Zhenjiang communications station by phone, and let them write it." Later, after patient persuasion, he was told not to be impatient, to take it slowly, it is best to write about one problem and one thing at a time, and write down what he did honestly. Sure enough, he wrote according to this method, recording it plainly and straightforwardly like reporting work, using his own peasant vocabulary, which was easy to understand. After writing, he asked Comrades Shi Chengren and Zhang Shengde to correct the wrong words and supplement the insufficient materials, and completed the first draft.

            The things I did were published in the newspaper, what an honor!

    In a few days, the Southern Jiangsu Daily published this article in the headline position on the second page, which greatly strengthened Liu Tianyou's confidence in writing. After the masses in Huangnitang Village saw this news in the newspaper, everyone quickly spread it, and everyone was very happy. Farmer Zhang Zhenguo said: "We farmers did our own things and wrote about them in the newspaper ourselves. I never dreamed of it. What an honor!" The village activists Chen Zhenhua, Dai Wangliu, as well as Ji Xinglin and Sun Yucai from Dajie Village in Dongshan Town, also asked Lao Liu for advice on how to write. Liu Tianyou was even happier. With the help of the superiors, a farmer correspondent group was quickly established. Under the leadership of Liu Tianyou, everyone helped Chen Zhenhua write an article "Sun Longhao's Solution to Wheat Seed Difficulties" which was published in the Southern Jiangsu Daily. By November, Lao Liu had written a total of five articles, and four of them had been published.

            Conclusion

    The reason why Comrade Liu Tianyou was able to go from literacy to writing in one year is not an accidental miracle. The main reasons are the specific cultivation and help of superiors and many comrades, as well as his own efforts to overcome various difficulties in learning, so that he can have such achievements today. The leadership also deeply realized that cultivating peasant correspondents cannot be successful overnight. This is a long and arduous process and should be regarded as a regular correspondence work. To the object of cultivation, we should get closer, understand his life, grasp his learning and thinking, and help him solve practical difficulties and concerns in a timely manner.

　　从文盲到农民通讯员
    ——记刘天有学习文化、学习写稿的经验
   路柳、中奇  刘诗、清昆
    一九五○年四月全国新闻工作会议后，新闻总署“关于改进报纸工作的决定”中明白指出：“报纸的通讯员网应当以人民群众中的积极分子为主体，除工人农民中的积极分子外，也要吸收政府机关中的积极的工作人员和进步的知识分子参加。”江苏江宁县委领导机关根据上述精神，在全县原有的通讯工作基础上，开始培养了工农通讯员，县一等劳动模范刘天有就是其中之一。刘天有同志已是苏南日报积极的农民通讯员了。
            刘天有是怎样的人？
    刘天有在解放前是帮工的，原籍是安徽定远县，今年三十五岁。十一岁即由老家逃荒到江宁黄泥塘村，起先替地主易炳森放牛，年稍长即帮长工，后来自己又租了地主陈益寿两亩多田，逐渐增加到十余亩。他深受地主阶级的封建剥削和残酷压榨。解放后，他首先加入了农会。通过阶级诉苦和党的政治教育，他的觉悟程度逐步提高。他发动全村农民向地主、恶霸展开说理斗争，减回二万余斤的租稻。到了今年春荒期间，在人民政府的领导下，他又发动群众生产救灾，安度春荒；夏天修圩堤，于四天内突击完成了“村前大圩”，使全村一亩田也没有被淹掉（去年淹田六百亩）。生产季节来到了，他又领导大家执行了上级“不荒一亩田”的生产政策，保证了全村秋季丰收，比去年增产二十五万斤粮食。在这一年多来各种运动中，刘天有始终团结了农民群众完成了每一个中心工作的任务，深得全村、全区、全县农民的爱戴。七月间在江宁县二届农代大会上，他被选为全县一等劳动模范。
            不认字能怪父母吗？
    刘天有参加农会以后，在反霸、减租、生产等过程中，最感到苦恼的是自己不识字。比如减租吧，在算减租账的时候不会写，不会算，想找村上识字的三个人（二个伪保长，一个伪镇长），又怕他们搞鬼，也怕群众反映自己立场不稳。在排水修圩的时候，他带头借来了很多水车，为了避免混淆，想写上各户名字做标记，但自己不能动笔，他觉得有苦无处诉。他怪父母不好，小的时候没让他上学。
    根据上述思想情况，当地领导上首先对他进行文化诉苦的教育，指出穷人所以不识字，没有文化，是因为旧社会制度不合理。用追根，查根，回忆过去放牛、帮长工的生活，来与地主阶级“饱食终日，无所事事”的生活作了对比，使他了解小时候没有读到书不能怪父母，应该怪地主阶级。他说：“地主家的小孩七、八岁上学，我正在帮他们放牛；到了十七、八岁我当长工，他们的孩子已上中学了。”经过文化诉苦，刘天有的政治觉悟提高了。
            怎样解决学文化的困难？
    刘天有的觉悟提高之后，便要求学文化了。他深深体会到文化对于生活和工作的重要，如不学文化，工作一定会碰到许多困难。他开始找领导干部谈话。领导干部竭力鼓励他的学习情绪，告诉他许多中国历史上生动的苦读书故事，并指出老区人民翻身后积极参加识字班、上冬学，不到半年就可以读报、写信。这些实际例子给他很大的影响，提高了他学习文化的情绪。
    刘天有起初感到识字非常困难。他向领导上反映：读书是小时候的事，现在年纪大了，脑子笨，不易学得好。他犯了急性病，想一下手把什么都学好。领导同志对他说明“只要功夫深，铁尺磨成针”的道理，譬如每天认一个字，一年就可识三百六十个字，两年可识七百多字，慢慢学多了就会用了。同时又教他一些基本的学习方法，要他闲下来就写，就读，不认识的应该随时请教别人，要虚心。他从“刘天有”、“黄泥塘”、“共产党”、“人民政府”这些容易记的字和词学起，然后慢慢念成行、成段、成篇的通俗文字。
    为了具体帮助他学习，区上的同志们到了学习时间，就把他找去共同学习，材料以苏南日报为主，别人读，他跟着念，直到没有生字时才止。这样每天念一段，老刘逐渐认识了好多字，对学习发生了感情，养成了学习的习惯。
    领导上按期检查他的学习成绩，及时的表扬他好的积极的一面，批评他的缺点和错误的一面。起先他思想上有顾虑，爱面子，怕别人笑话他学得不好，不愿意领导上去检查督促。后来进行了说服教育，对他指出学习大家都是一样，都要下苦功的。好比栽秧，初学时是不能够栽得直、栽得快，栽得好的，慢慢才熟练起来。学文化也是如此，不是一出妈妈肚子就会的，而是逐步提高的。经过这种不断的教育，爱面子的思想基本上打消了。他到处请教别人。他一年来的进步是突飞猛进的。
    他每天学习报纸，在报纸上看见关于黄泥塘村的生产情况及他们大伙所订的生产计划，心中非常高兴。领导上即抓住这个机会，告诉他人民报纸是人民的喉舌，是代表人民利益的，与反动派的报纸根本不同；告诉他毛主席的文化方针是为工农兵服务的，激发他为报纸写稿的情绪。
            想写稿又有思想顾虑
    写稿这件事对于一个刚学会识字读书的农民，确是相当困难的。每当他在报上看见黄泥塘村的新闻时，心中总是痒痒的，想动手写，又怕自己不行。过去反动派在这里，弄笔墨的都是有两下的，如陈益寿（地主），匡正（江宁县大恶霸，已伏法）等。自己呢，到底是个老粗，怕写不好，上级会笑话。他几次想动笔写，都不敢大胆下手。
    江宁县委负责通讯工作的路柳同志了解此一情况后，即向刘天有解释：“今天共产党、人民政府是知道我们穷人没有文化的苦楚的，你写得不好，上级不但不会笑话，反会帮助你，提高你的文化水平。”接着又告诉他人民报纸是人民的喉舌，你可以把穷人受地主压迫的痛苦写出来，登在报纸上。同时也可以把你领导黄泥塘村生产的情况向外报导，供上级和邻区了解。县委领导上指定史成仁、刘诗二同志负责帮助他克服写稿的困难；区里又指定东山镇俱乐部主任张盛德（小学教师）具体帮助他。首先由刘天有口述，张替他笔记；到第二阶段，由老刘自己写好，再替他改错字，顺词句；后来就由他本人自己搜集材料，自己去写。由于他自己的不断努力和别人的具体帮助，刘天有同志飞快地进步着。张盛德见到他进步得这么快，也提高了自己的写稿信心。他说：“我真佩服刘天有，材料有了，拿起笔来就写，这种学文化学写稿的精神真使我们知识分子钦佩。”
    经过这样具体细致的帮助，老刘同志的思想顾虑完全打破了，他动笔替报纸写稿子了！
            写什么？怎么写？
    同年九月初，刘天有同志到苏南开农代会议，报社同志要他写一篇生产稿子。他回家后看到黄泥塘丰收的情景，认为这是可以对外报导的。在别人的帮助下，他确定了稿子的中心内容后，首先到村里召开了农会委员、行政委员、农民代表、居民小组长的会议，了解和调查了今年秋收产量，并算出每亩最低产量和最高产量，以及两个年头总收入的对比。大家一致认为今年比去年增产七成，于是他又追问大家，今年为什么比去年产量多，要大家在会上细细谈谈根源，结果群众话匣打开啦，一致认识到这是共产党毛主席来了，领导大家组织团结起来，战胜了灾荒，才有这样收获的。刘天有趁此机会号召大家加强民兵组织，保卫生产，保卫秋收，全村人民都一致同意他的意见。经过这样细致深入采访，把材料找到手之后，他便大胆握笔写了。
    开始写稿的时候，他又碰上了困难，原因是想把村上一切问题都包括进去，写出来的又乱又长。领导上告诉他这样写法不妥当，他着急了，说：“我不写了，还是让我把工作在电话里向镇江通讯站汇报吧，由他们去写好了。”后来又经过耐心的说服，叫他不要性急，慢慢来，一次最好写一个问题，一桩事情，把自己做的事，老老实实地写出来就行了。果然，他按照这个方法去写，像汇报工作一样平铺直叙地记载下来，运用自己农民的语汇，通俗易懂。写好后，他又请史成仁、张盛德二同志修改错字，补充不足的材料，完成了第一篇稿子。
            自己做的事登上了报，真光荣啊！
    没有几天，苏南日报以二版头条的地位刊登了这篇稿子，这大大加强了刘天有写稿的信心。黄泥塘村群众在报上见到这条新闻之后，大家都很快的传开了，每个人都很高兴。农民张振国说：“我们农民自己做的事，又自己写上报，做梦也没想到，真光荣啊！”村上的积极分子陈振华、戴望流以及东山镇大街村的纪兴林、孙玉才等也向老刘请教如何写稿？这样刘天有更高兴了。在上级帮助下，迅速成立了一个农民通讯小组。在刘天有的领导下，大家又帮助陈振华写了一篇“孙龙浩解决麦种困难的办法”登在苏南日报上。到十一月止，老刘共写了五篇，已经登出的有四篇了。
            结论
    刘天有同志所以能够在一年内从识字到写稿，这并不是偶然的奇迹，主要原因还是上级和许多同志的具体培养和帮助，以及本人的努力，战胜了学习上的种种困难，才能有今天这样的成绩。领导上也深深体会到：培养农民通讯员并不是一朝一夕就可以成功的，这是一个长期艰巨的过程，应该把它当作一个经常性的通讯工作去做的。对培养对象，平时应该多接近，了解他的生活，掌握他的学习思想情况，及时地帮助他解决实际困难和顾虑。
