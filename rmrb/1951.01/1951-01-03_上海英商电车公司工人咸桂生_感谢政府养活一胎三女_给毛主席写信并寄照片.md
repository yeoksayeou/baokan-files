Shanghai British Tramway Company Worker Xian Guisheng
Thanks the Government for Supporting Triple Daughters, Writes Letter to Chairman Mao and Sends Photograph

Chairman Mao:

I am a worker at the Shanghai British Tramway Company. On January 28th of this year, my wife gave birth to triplets at济民 Hospital. Before being discharged, due to postpartum weakness, lack of milk, and inability to raise them, I had no choice but to request the Municipal Maternal and Child Health Hospital to arrange for their care, which was approved by the Municipal Health Bureau. The Shanghai Democratic Women's Federation also hired a nanny on our behalf, with all expenses borne by the Women's Federation for one year.

I am a member of the working class with a family of nine children, a great responsibility. My eldest son, Yongquan, 22, abandoned commerce to study at the East China Military and Political University; my second son, Yonggen, 20, serves in the Civil Affairs Section of the Political Department of the 11th Anti-Aircraft Artillery Regiment of the East China 3rd Field Army; my third son, Yongjin, 16, was not admitted to the National Military and Political School due to age restrictions and is now studying at a municipal night school, relying on the state for his education. My eldest daughter, Yongming, 18, assists with household chores. There are also my second daughter, youngest son, and the triplets.

Since the liberation of this city, although the people have encountered various difficulties due to the successive bombings and blockades by the American imperialists and Chiang Kai-shek bandits, the people's suffering has been gradually relieved thanks to the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao.

The above-mentioned three infants are now innocent and lively. I am infinitely grateful for the government's assistance and will never forget it. I will instruct my children to study hard and improve their political understanding so that they may serve the people and contribute to the country. I will work hard to increase production. I am enclosing a photo of the three infant daughters for your kind safekeeping. With respectful greetings!

Respectfully submitted,
Xian Guisheng
November 24, 1950
Address: No. 5, Lane 93, Ruijin Road 1, Shanghai

Editor's Note: Xian Guisheng joined the British Tramway Company as a ticket seller in 1933. Under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, and working in a foreign enterprise, he worked diligently, fearing to lose his job, and his family's life was extremely difficult to maintain. On a certain day in July 1946, Xian Guisheng was unjustifiably injured when selling tickets because he refused a Chiang Kai-shek soldier to board the tram beyond his stop, and was transferred to the Huimin Road factory as a gatekeeper, and his monthly salary was also reduced. Xian Guisheng and his wife already had six children, and when they had triplets last January 28th, Shanghai was suffering from the blockade and bombing by the American imperialists and Chiang Kai-shek bandits, and the economic situation was very difficult, but the Shanghai Municipal People's Government still gave them appropriate care. In mid-November of last year, after he requested it, the trade union, in order to solve his difficulties, assisted in submitting the matter to the administration, and he was transferred to Route 14 as a ticket seller. Xian Guisheng is already 51 years old, and he has never received such care as he does today. He said, "I really realize how the People's Government loves the people. I have never seen anything like this before." He had a photo taken of the three children together and sent it to the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau, the Women's Federation, and the Health Institute, and specially had a large color print made of several copies, which he enclosed in a letter to Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Soong Ching Ling, and Shanghai Mayor Chen Yi to express his gratitude.

　　上海英商电车公司工人咸桂生
    感谢政府养活一胎三女  给毛主席写信并寄照片毛主席：
    我是上海英商电车公司工人。今年一月二十八日，我的妻子在济民医院产下一胎三女，出院前因产后身体衰弱，无奶，乏力抚养。迫不得已，请求市立妇婴保健院设法安置，当蒙本市卫生局予以批准。又经上海市民主妇联代雇保姆一名，在一年内所有费用统由妇联负担。
    我是工人阶级一分子。共有儿女九口，责任重大。长子镛泉二十二岁，弃商入华东军大求学；次子镛根二十岁，在华东第三野战军高射炮十一团政治处民联股服务；三子镛金十六岁，因限于年龄，投考国立军政学校未被录取，现在市立夜中求学，依靠国家培养。长女镛明十八岁，协助家务。尚有次女、幼子及三胞胎。
    本市解放以来，虽遭美帝蒋匪迭次轰炸、封锁，人民遭遇着各种困难，但由于中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导，人民痛苦均得渐渐解除。
    上述三婴儿现均天真活泼。得到政府帮助，我真是没齿不忘，感激万分。当命子女努力学习提高其政治认识，俾得为人民服务，为国家效劳。我当努力增加生产。现附呈三婴女照片一张，敬请惠存。此致敬礼！
                       咸桂生敬上  一九五○年十一月二十四日
                       通讯处  上海瑞金一路九十三弄五号
    编者按：咸桂生于一九三三年入英商电车公司当售票员，在国民党反动统治下，又在外商企业做工，兢兢业业，惟恐打破饭碗，一家人生活极难维持。一九四六年七月某日，咸桂生曾因卖票时拒绝一蒋匪军人过站上车，被无理扭伤臂膀，遂转至惠民路工场看门，月薪亦被减低。咸桂生夫妇原有六个孩子，当去年一月二十八日新得三女的时候，正值上海遭受美帝蒋匪封锁轰炸的时期，经济情况非常困难，但上海市人民政府卫生局仍予以适当照顾。去年十一月中，经他请求后，工会为解决他的困难，协助向行政提出，已调至十四路卖票。咸桂生已经五十一岁，数十年来从来没有得到过像今天这样的照顾，他说：“我交关认识到人民政府是如何爱护人民，像这种事体从来也没看见过。”他给三个孩子一起拍了照，分送给上海市卫生局、妇联和保健院，并特加大套色印了几张，附在信里送给毛主席、宋庆龄副主席以及上海市陈毅市长，表示感激。
