To effectively guarantee the people's land and property ownership after the land reform, and to consolidate and enhance farmers' enthusiasm for production, the Ministry of Interior of the Central People's Government issued the "Instructions on Filling Out and Issuing Land and Property Ownership Certificates" on November 25, 1950. The instructions stipulate that in all areas where land reform has been completed, land and houses newly distributed to farmers or originally owned by them should be issued land and property ownership certificates (referred to as land certificates). Land and houses distributed to landlords should also be handled in the same way. In the suburban areas of cities where land reform has been implemented, in accordance with the State Council's instructions on land reform in suburban areas: "Confiscated land from landlords and requisitioned land rented out by old-style rich peasants, for the needs of urban construction and industrial development, shall be owned by the state and managed by the municipal people's government, and distributed to landless and land-poor farmers for use." the major administrative regions should issue land use certificates based on specific circumstances; farmers' original land should be issued ownership certificates. Land certificates should be issued to households as a unit. To indicate that the land and property of the entire household are jointly owned by all members of the household (men, women, old and young), the instructions stipulate that the land certificate should not only record the name of the head of household but should list the names of all members of the household. When issuing new certificates, in accordance with Article 30 of the Land Reform Law: all land contracts prior to the land system reform shall be invalidated and confiscated. The instructions emphasize that the issuance of land certificates is an important task in land reform and should be completed as a political task under leadership. It is also stipulated that all regions should formulate specific measures and plans based on their specific circumstances, organize a certificate issuing committee with representatives from the finance and civil affairs departments to participate and cooperate. To obtain a roughly accurate acreage of land and to ensure land rights, the certificate issuing work must be closely combined with the land survey work, paying attention to eliminating undeclared land. As for the method of clearing land, a general survey may generally not be carried out, but the method of key spot checks and self-reporting and public discussion can be adopted, and farmers should be informed that undeclared land will not be legally protected, and farmers should be encouraged to truthfully report their land acreage.

In order to closely coordinate with the work of filling out and issuing land and property ownership certificates, the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government notified all levels of financial departments on December 28, 1950, to send personnel to participate in the work of the certificate issuing committee at the corresponding level, and to pay close attention to land and population surveys and statistics, and the investigation of undeclared land. In order to quickly issue land certificates after the land reform, attention should be paid to the investigation and statistics of these figures before the land reform begins. If necessary, financial departments at all levels may cooperate with the land reform committee at the corresponding level to conduct and promote investigation and statistical work.

　　保障土地改革后农民土地所有权
    内务部指示各地颁发土地证
    财政部通知所属协同进行调查统计工作
    【本报讯】为切实保障土地改革后人民的土地房产所有权，巩固与提高农民生产情绪，中央人民政府内务部于一九五○年十一月二十五日发出“关于填发土地房产所有证的指示”。该指示规定：凡土地改革已完成的地区，不论农民新分的或原有的土地房屋，均应一律颁发土地房产所有证（简称土地证）。分给地主的土地房屋也同样办理，已实行土地改革的城市郊区，则遵照政务院郊区土地改革指示：“没收地主土地、征收旧式富农出租的土地，为了城市建设与工业发展之需要，一律归国家所有，由市人民政府管理，并分配给无地与少地农民使用。”的原则，由各大行政区依据具体情况发给土地使用证；农民原有之土地则发给所有证。土地证以户为单位填发。为了表明全户土地房产为该户成员（男女老幼）所共有，指示规定：土地证上不能只记户主一人姓名，应将该户全体成员的姓名开列在内。新证填发时，应根据土地改革法第三十条的规定：土地制度改革以前的土地契约，一律作废，并予缴销。指示着重指出：颁发土地证是土地改革中的一项重要工作，在领导上应当作政治任务来完成。并规定各地要根据具体情况制订具体办法及计划，组织发证委员会，由财政部门及民政部门派人参加，分工合作。为求得土地亩数大致准确，以确实保障地权。发证工作必须与清查土地工作密切结合，注意消灭黑田。至于清理土地的方法，一般可不实行普丈而采取重点抽丈和自报公议的方法进行，应向农民说明黑地得不到合法保障，启发农民实报田亩。
    又中央人民政府财政部为密切配合填发土地房产所有证工作，于一九五○年十二月二十八日通知各级财政部门派员参加同级发证委员会的工作，并须密切注意土地、人口的调查统计及清查黑田等事项。为了在土地改革后迅速颁发土地证，应在土地改革开始前即注意此项数字的清查和统计，必要时各级财政部门可协同同级土地改革委员会，进行与推动调查统计工作。
