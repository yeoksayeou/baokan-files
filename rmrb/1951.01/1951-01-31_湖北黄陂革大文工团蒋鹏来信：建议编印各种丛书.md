Hubei Huangpi Revolutionary University Cultural Troupe Jiang Peng's Letter:
Suggests Compiling and Printing Various Series of Books

In order to promote the publicity and educational role of newspapers and magazines across the country and to satisfy the thirst for knowledge of readers in various places, we suggest that publishing agencies collect valuable texts from newspapers and magazines across the country, compile and print series of books of various types, and distribute them across the country.

Currently, there are many newspapers and magazines, each with its own focus and content, including many good articles. However, many people feel that they do not have the time or the conditions to read newspapers and magazines from all over the country. Therefore, we suggest that good articles from newspapers and magazines across the country be compiled into series of books of different types on a regular basis (every three months or six months) and recommended to all parts of the country. This would be very helpful to readers in various places.

　　湖北黄陂革大文工团蒋鹏来信：
    建议编印各种丛书
    为了推广全国各地报章杂志的宣传教育作用，并满足各地读者的求知欲望，我们建议出版机关汇集各地报章杂志中的有价值文字，编印各种性质丛书，发行全国各地。
    目前各种报章杂志很多，且各有不同的重心和内容，其中有许多好文章。但许多人都感觉没有时间，也没有条件遍读各地报章杂志。因此我们建议，希能按期（三月或半年）将全国各地报章杂志中的好文章，编印成各种不同性质的丛书，推荐到全国各地去。这样做对各地读者是很有帮助的。
