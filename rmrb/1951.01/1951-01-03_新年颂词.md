　　New Year's Greetings
　　Bai Latí, Deputy Director of the Xinjiang Finance Committee, a member of the Uygur people
    In 1950, under the leadership of our great leader and teacher Comrade Mao Zedong, all nationalities within our vast and expansive motherland established a big family of freedom, happiness, unity, and fraternity. In 1951, the Tibetan people residing in Tibet and the Gaoshan and other brother nationalities residing in Taiwan will return to the warm embrace of this great family. We firmly believe that in the coming year, the forces of world peace, democracy, and socialism will be even more incomparably powerful, and will completely shatter the aggressive conspiracies of American imperialism.
    A New Year's salute to the Korean people who are engaged in heroic struggles to defend their independence and freedom against the brutal and bloody American imperialism!
    A New Year's salute to the Chinese People's Volunteers who are fighting alongside the Korean People's Army for freedom, democracy, and peace, opposing the reactionary aggressive forces of American imperialism!
    Under the great banner of Mao Zedong, forever march forward to victory!

　　新年颂词
    新疆财委副主任维吾尔族人士  白拉提
    一九五○年在我们伟大领袖、导师毛泽东同志的领导下，我们辽阔广大祖国内的各民族建立了自由幸福团结友爱的大家庭，一九五一年更将会有居住在西藏的藏族，居住在台湾的高山等兄弟民族回到这个伟大家庭的温暖怀抱中。我们坚信在来年全世界和平、民主、社会主义的力量更是无比的强大，将会彻底粉碎美帝国主义的侵略阴谋。
    向保卫自己的独立自由而与残暴的血腥的美帝国主义进行英勇斗争的朝鲜人民致新年敬礼！
    向争取自由、民主、和平与朝鲜人民军并肩作战反对美帝反动侵略势力的中国人民志愿部队致新年敬礼！
    在毛泽东伟大的旗帜下永远向胜利前进！
