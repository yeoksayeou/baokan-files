　　Soviet Republics and Autonomous Republics of the Soviet Union
    Preparing for Elections to the Supreme Soviet
    [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 8th] A comprehensive report from TASS, Moscow: The Soviet Republics and Autonomous Republics of the Soviet Union will hold elections for their Supreme Soviets in February, and election preparations are in full swing. Each republic has established a Central Election Commission and district election commissions. The election in the Russian Federation is scheduled for February 18th, and the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet has announced the election regulations. Members of the district election commissions have been appointed. Election districts have been demarcated in Moscow, and the executive committees of the district Soviets are beginning to compile voter registers. The number of electoral districts has greatly increased compared to previous elections to the Supreme Soviets of the republics, indicating the significant development of Soviet cities and villages after the war. In the Kazakh Republic, for example, the one hundred newly added electoral districts were established in residential areas that have sprung up in the last four years.
    Hundreds of thousands of prominent workers, collective farmers, teachers, engineers, and scientists have taken on the role of election propagandists, working across the Soviet Union to explain the election regulations and the current domestic and international situation to voters. The issues that voters are most concerned about are the great communist construction in the Soviet Union, the worldwide movement to defend peace, and the struggle against American aggression.
    The Soviet people are welcoming the elections with new production victories. Workers in Moscow, Leningrad, Kiev, Minsk, and other cities have widely launched Stakhanovite movements to welcome the elections. In the Uzbek Republic, Stakhanovite workers in many factories have already overfulfilled production plans for a large number of goods in the first few days of the year. The Tashkent United Textile Factory—the largest textile factory in Soviet Central Asia—has overfulfilled its production plan by 22,000 meters of textiles and 1,100 kilograms of cotton yarn. The entire staff of Uzbekistan's most advanced No. 2 coal mine exceeded its production plan by 73 percent last year, and on January 4th of this year, it overproduced 33 tons of coal. Production reports are also pouring in from other parts of the Soviet Union.

　　苏联各加盟共和国及自治共和国
    筹备进行最高苏维埃选举
    【新华社八日讯】综合塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联各加盟共和国及自治共和国将于二月间举行最高苏维埃选举，选举的筹备工作正在热烈进行中。各共和国均已成立了中央选举委员会与区选举委员会。俄罗斯联邦的选举定于二月十八日举行，最高苏维埃主席团已公布了选举条例。各区选举委员会的委员已指派出来。莫斯科已经划分了选区，各区苏维埃执行委员会正开始编制选民册。选举区的数目和过去各共和国最高苏维埃选举时相较已大大增加，这表明了战后苏联城市与乡村的大大发展。以哈萨克共和国为例，新增加的一百个选举区，就是在最近四年内兴起的居民区中成立的。
    数十万著名的工人、集体农民、教师、工程师和科学家，担任了选举宣传员，正在全苏各地展开工作，向选民们讲解选举条例和目前国内外局势。选民们最关心的问题是苏联伟大的共产主义建设、全世界保卫和平运动与反对美国侵略的斗争。
    苏联人民正纷纷以新的生产胜利迎接选举。莫斯科、列宁格勒、基辅、明斯克及其他城市的工人们，已经广泛地展开了迎接选举的斯塔哈诺夫运动。在乌兹贝克共和国，许多工厂的斯塔哈诺夫工人已在今年的头几天内超计划生产了大批的货物，塔什干的联合纺织厂——苏联中亚细亚最大的纺织厂已超计划生产了二万二千公尺的纺织品和一千一百公斤的棉纱，乌兹贝克最先进的第二号煤场的全体员工，在去年超过生产计划百分之七十三，今年一月四日又超计划产煤三十三吨。生产捷报也从全苏其他各地纷纷传来。
