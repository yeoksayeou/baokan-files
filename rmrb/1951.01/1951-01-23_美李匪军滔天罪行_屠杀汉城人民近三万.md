　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 19th: According to the Korean Central News Agency in Seoul, the U.S. and Lee bandit troops committed unprecedented massacres during their three-month occupation of Seoul. According to incomplete statistics, over 28,000 patriots and innocent people were massacred by the bandit troops. The streets of Seoul were stained with the blood of patriots. In the air-raid shelters of Mapo District and the former puppet police station in Seongbuk-dong, bodies of patriots were found that the enemy did not have time to bury when they fled, many of whom were elderly people, pregnant women, and children. Not only were members of the Labor Party, cadres of the people's government organs, and patriotic democrats targeted, but also ordinary citizens were subjected to massacre and torture by the bandits. Kim Yong-ja, a woman who ran a tailor shop in Taejeon-dong, was arrested and shot after being tortured just twelve days after giving birth, because she had made uniforms for the People's Army. The baby was frozen to death. Kim Seong-pil, a resident of Gye-dong, accused: "The American devils and Lee bandit troops did all sorts of bad things during their second occupation of Seoul. The people's property was either plundered or burned. Women were raped by beasts everywhere. I was arrested and tortured for more than ten days by special agents because I had supported the People's Army. If the People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers hadn't arrived so quickly, I would not have survived. I am determined to do everything in my power to support them in wiping out the enemy as soon as possible." Park Chun-hee, who runs a small noodle shop in Hangang Street, witnessed American executioners directing puppet police to burn dozens of patriots with gasoline on the Han River beach on December 28. Kim Myung-nam, a resident of Noryangjin Street in Yeongdeungpo District, accused: "One night in mid-November, a group of bandit troops押着two or three hundred family members of patriots and pushed them all into the Han River to drown. Among them were five or six children." The people of Seoul, who have been freed from the bloody rule of the U.S. and Lee bandit gangs, are firmly demanding that the People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers avenge them.

　　美李匪军滔天罪行
    屠杀汉城人民近三万
    【新华社平壤十九日电】据朝鲜中央通讯社汉城讯：美、李匪军在盘踞汉城的三个月中，造下了世界史上罕有的屠杀暴行。据不完全的统计，被匪军屠杀的爱国者和无辜人民在二万八千人以上。汉城的街道染遍了爱国者的血迹。在麻浦区和城北街前伪警察署的防空壕里，都已发现了敌人溃逃时未及掩埋的爱国者的尸体，其中有许多是老年人、孕妇和儿童。不仅劳动党党员、人民政权机关的干部和爱国民主人士，就是一般市民也成了匪徒们屠杀与拷打的对象。在太原洞开设洋服店的妇女金容子，因为曾给人民军做过军装，竟在分娩后十二天被匪徒们捉去，经拷打后遭枪杀，婴儿被活活地冻死。桂洞的居民金成弼控诉说：“美国鬼子和李匪军在第二次侵占汉城期间，做尽了一切坏事。人民的财产不是被掠夺，就是被烧掉。妇女被野兽们强奸的，在在皆是。我因支援过人民军而被特务抓去拷打了十多天。要不是人民军和中国人民志愿军来得快的话，我一定活不成了。我决心尽一切力量来支援他们早日消灭敌人。”在汉江街开小面馆的朴春姬，亲眼看到美国刽子手指挥伪警察于十二月二十八日在汉江沙滩上用汽油烧死数十名爱国者。永登浦区鹭梁津街的居民金明南控诉说：“十一月中旬的一个深夜，一群匪军押着二、三百个爱国者的家属，把他们全部推到汉江里淹死了。其中还有五、六个小孩子。”摆脱了美、李匪帮血腥统治的汉城市人民，坚决要求人民军和中国人民志愿军为他们报仇。
