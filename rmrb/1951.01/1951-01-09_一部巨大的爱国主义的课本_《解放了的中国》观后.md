　　A Huge Textbook of Patriotism
    ——After Viewing "Liberated China"
    Bai Yuan
    Our motherland has always been beautiful, but never before has it been as beautiful as it is today. Our motherland has always been great, but never before has it felt as great as it does today. For thousands of years, our great nation has created a brilliant culture and art on this vast and fertile land. We have shed sweat and blood on this land. To build a peaceful and happy life, the Chinese people have lived like beasts of burden under the long-term oppression and exploitation of reactionary forces at home and abroad. The people built many magnificent palaces for generations of emperors, but the people themselves often had no place to live. The wealth we created with our blood and sweat was only for the plunder of imperialism. But we have never forgotten that we are the true masters of this land. Chairman Mao led us from those dark years all the way to victory. The Yangtze and Yellow Rivers flow endlessly, and happy flowers bloom all over the land from north to south. The red flag in front of Tiananmen Square in Beijing and the free smoke rising again in every city and village rise together. Joyful songs remind us again of the human love that was buried in blood and ashes. All of this is now vividly before our eyes. "Liberated China" is the poem of the Chinese people that cannot be fully expressed or written.
    This is not an ordinary film. This is a huge textbook composed of many concrete images of life and precious historical pictures. Through colorful lenses, the history created by the industrious Chinese people for thousands of years shines so brightly for the first time in front of the Chinese people and the people of the world. Every city, every village, every river and mountain is scattered with the footprints of the brave Chinese people's struggle. From Ruijin to Yan'an, from north to south, Chairman Mao led us to complete the heroic cause of the Chinese people in human history. On this happy day, the victorious people use vows of love and hate to mourn the heroes of our motherland. In Beijing, people hang the noose used by the executioner to strangle Comrade Li Dazhao in front of Comrade Li Dazhao's portrait to remember our martyrs and the history of our people's struggle. In the distant south, the people of Guangzhou, who once established the first revolutionary regime in the history of the Chinese people, offered brilliant wreaths to those heroes who sacrificed themselves for the cause of the people. The people of the Guangzhou revolutionary regime will always remember that winter morning in 1927, that Sunday morning. The dark prison was opened. The people who were being persecuted in the prison rushed out of the prison gate before they could open the shackles on their feet. The sound of gunfire attacking the enemy resounded everywhere, and the roaring slogans, accompanied by the sound of shackles on their feet, shook the heavens and the earth. … The people of the Guangzhou revolutionary regime also remember the sound of the imperialist warships attacking the people. It was under the executioner's noose and under the guns of imperialism that the brave Chinese people carried out an indomitable struggle to achieve today's victory. Our great motherland was reborn in such a cruel struggle and returned to the hands of the people. Today, on the land of our motherland, every flower with dew contains the blood of our people.
    But precisely because of this, the flowers of our motherland bloom so brightly and beautifully. Precisely because of this, we have such a deep love for our motherland. Under the historical background of the great Chinese people, under the banner of the victorious people, we have established factories, schools, and nurseries, and the farmers who till the land have land. A free and happy life reminds us of our past and looks forward to our future. The film "Liberated China" uses these rich historical pictures and extremely concrete images of life to educate the Chinese people, so that we understand how to love our motherland, love the thousands of years of brilliant history created by our working people, and love the happy life we ​​once exchanged with blood. Comrade Stalin said as early as 1925: "The power of the Chinese revolution is immeasurable. These forces have not yet been properly expressed. They will be expressed in the future." (Lenin and Stalin on China, Liberation Press Edition, 1950, page 133.) Now that this "immeasurable" power has been felt, let us, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, further complete the glorious cause of the Chinese people.

　　一部巨大的爱国主义的课本
    ——《解放了的中国》观后
    白原
    我们的祖国向来是美丽的，但是在过去，没有那一天像今天这样的美丽。我们的祖国向来是伟大的，但过去没有那一天像今天这样感觉到它的伟大。几千年来，我们的伟大民族在这一块广大丰饶的土地上创造了光辉灿烂的文化和艺术。我们在这一块土地上洒遍了汗水和鲜血。为了建立一个和平的、美好的生活，在过去，在国内外反动势力的长期压迫和剥削下，中国人民一直过着牛马一样的生活。人民为一代一代的帝王建造了许多巍峨的宫殿，但人民自己却往往没有一个安身之所。我们用血汗创造的财富，只供帝国主义的抢掠。但我们始终没有忘记我们是这块土地上的真正主人。毛主席领导我们从那黑暗的年月一直战斗到胜利。长江黄河滚滚奔流，天南地北的土地上都开遍了幸福的鲜花。北京天安门前的红旗和每一个城市和乡村重新升起的自由的炊烟一起飘升起来。欢乐的歌声使我们重新记起了那些被鲜血和灰烬所掩埋着的人间的爱情。这一切，现在又活现在我们的眼前。《解放了的中国》，就是这些说不尽，写不完的中国人民的诗篇。
    这不是一部普通的电影。这是一部用许多具体的生活的形象和珍贵的历史画幅所构成的巨大的课本。通过一个个彩色的镜头，勤劳的中国人民几千年所创造的历史，第一次在中国人民面前，在世界人民面前发出了这样灿烂的光辉。每一个城市，每一个乡村，每一道河流和山岳，都散布着勇敢的中国人民战斗的足迹。从瑞金到延安，从北方到南方，毛主席带领着我们，在人类的历史上完成了中国人民的英雄事业。胜利的人民在这个幸福的日子里，用爱和恨的誓言来悼念我们的祖国的英烈。在北京，人们在李大钊同志的遗像前，挂起刽子手用来绞杀李大钊同志的绞索，来追念我们的先烈，追念我们的人民斗争的历史。在遥远的南方，曾经在中国人民的历史上建立了第一个革命政权的广州人民，给那些为人民的事业牺牲的英雄们献上了灿烂的花圈。广州革命政权的人民永远记得一九二七年的那个冬天，那一个星期日的早晨。黑暗的牢狱被打开了。在牢狱里受着迫害的人民来不及打开脚上的镣铐就冲出了牢门。向敌人进攻的枪声到处响着，怒吼的口号声伴着脚上的镣铐的响声，震动了天地。……广州革命政权的人民今天也还记得帝国主义的战舰向人民进攻的炮声。勇敢的中国人民，就是在刽子手的绞索之下，在帝国主义的枪炮之下进行了不屈不挠的斗争，才取得了今天的胜利。我们的伟大的祖国，就是在这样残酷的斗争里获得了新生，重新回到人民的手里。今天，在祖国的大地上，每一朵带着露水的花朵都包含着我们人民的鲜血。
    但是，正因为如此，我们祖国的花朵才开得这样鲜艳，这样美丽。正因为如此，我们对我们的祖国才有这样深切的热爱。在伟大的中国人民的历史背景下面，在胜利的人民的旗帜下面，我们建立了工厂、学校和托儿所，种地的农民有了土地。自由幸福的生活使我们记起我们的过去和展望我们的将来。《解放了的中国》这一部电影，就是以这些丰富的历史画面和极其具体的生活形象来教育中国的人民，使我们懂得如何去爱我们的祖国，爱我们劳动人民所创造的几千年光辉灿烂的历史，爱我们曾经用鲜血换来的幸福的生活。斯大林同志远在一九二五年曾经说过：“中国革命的力量是不可计量的。这些力量还没有恰当地表现出来。它们将来还会表现出来。”（列宁、斯大林论中国，一九五○年解放社版、第一三三页。）现在这个“不可计量”的力量已经被人感觉出来了，那么就让我们在毛主席的领导下，更进一步来完成中国人民的光辉事业吧。
