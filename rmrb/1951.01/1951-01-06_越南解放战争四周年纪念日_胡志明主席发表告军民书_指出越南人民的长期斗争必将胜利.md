Xinhua News Agency, January 5th: On the occasion of the fourth anniversary of the Vietnamese War of Liberation on December 19, 1950, Ho Chi Minh, President of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, issued a letter to the Vietnamese armed forces and people.

In his letter, President Ho Chi Minh first extended congratulations to the military and civilians nationwide, as well as overseas Vietnamese. He then analyzed the situation of the Vietnamese War of Liberation, stating: After four years of heroic struggle, the Vietnamese people's War of Liberation has entered a new phase. On the enemy's side, due to their unjust war against Vietnam, the reactionary French are accelerating their collapse in military, economic, and political terms, and are increasingly relying on American imperialism. French imperialism itself has openly admitted that the Vietnam War causes France to lose 1,000 people monthly and spends nearly 1 billion francs daily. Needless to say, French imperialism has suffered other serious losses, such as those incurred in the recent battles along the northern border front. The French imperialist aggression against Vietnam has been strongly opposed by all the working people of France, and a section of the French bourgeoisie also disagrees with this war. Today, the French government is very unstable, and French society is divided by domestic struggles. In short, our enemy's position is deteriorating. On our side: We have not only survived four years of hardship and difficulty, but have also made great progress in all aspects. We have gained the sympathy of the democratic people of the world and the enthusiastic support of the French people. In the recent autumn offensive, we liberated five provinces, killing, wounding, and capturing nearly 10,000 French troops and 367 French officers and sergeants. Our army is steadily advancing, and our people of all nationalities have become stronger and more united than before. Our victory is also the victory of the world's peace and democracy camp.

The letter continued: After four years of nationwide resistance, we have achieved great victories and gained the initiative in offensive operations. These victories are due to the heroic fighting of our People's Army, the active participation and support of the people nationwide, the determination of our government, and the righteousness of our cause. However, we must never be complacent because of victory, nor should we underestimate our enemy. On the contrary, we must always remember that the closer the enemy gets to defeat, the more cruel they will become. Therefore, we must be prepared to overcome new difficulties and never forget that our struggle is a lasting and protracted one.

The letter concluded: Our current task is the same as before. Our soldiers must strengthen their training; the people in the rear must conduct friendly competitions, step up production, and increase their contributions to the war of resistance; our cadres must compete with each other in observing the revolutionary virtues of diligence, thrift, integrity, and righteousness; and the people of all strata of our country must strengthen unity. Given the favorable development of the international situation for us, the support of the democratic camp, and the invincible power of our people's unity, I am confident that our patriotic war will make greater progress, and our victory next year will be even greater than the victory of 1950.

Our protracted struggle will surely be victorious.

Our country will surely achieve unification and independence.

Fighters, compatriots, let us advance!

　　越南解放战争四周年纪念日
    胡志明主席发表告军民书
    指出越南人民的长期斗争必将胜利
    【新华社五日讯】越南民主共和国胡志明主席，于一九五○年十二月十九日越南解放战争四周年纪念日之际，发表告越南军民书。
    胡志明主席在告军民书中首先向全国军民暨海外越侨致以祝贺，接着分析越南解放战争的形势称：经过四年来英勇的斗争，越南人民解放战争已出现了一个崭新的形势。在敌人方面，由于他们对越南的非正义战争，法国反动派在军事上、经济上及政治上正加速崩溃，日益投靠美帝国主义。法国帝国主义自己已公开承认，越南战争使法国每月死亡一千人，每日消耗近十亿法郎。不用说，法帝国主义者还遭到其他严重损失，例如北部边境前线最近战役中所遭到的。法国帝国主义对越南的侵略战争遭到法国所有劳动人民的强力反对，法国的一部分资产阶级也不同意这个战争。今天，法国政府是非常不稳的，同时法国社会也因国内的斗争而四分五裂。简言之，我们敌人的地位正在日益恶化。在我们方面：我们不但撑过了四年的艰苦与困难，并且在各方面都有巨大的进步。我们获得了全世界民主人民的同情和法国人民的热心支持。在最近的秋季攻势中，我们解放了五个省，击毙击伤与俘掳法国部队近一万人及法国军官与军士三百六十七人。我们的军队正在稳步地前进，我国各族人民已变得更强大，并且比以前更加团结一致。我们的胜利也就是世界和平民主阵营的胜利。
    告军民书继称：经过四年来全国规模的抗战以后，我们已获得伟大的胜利，并且取得了攻势作战的主动权。这些胜利的获得，是由于我人民军的英勇作战，全国人民的积极参加与支援，我们政府的决心以及我们事业的正义性。不过我们绝不可因胜利而自满，也不应低估我们的敌人。相反地，我们必须常常记住：敌人愈接近失败必然会更残酷。因此，我们必须准备克服新的困难，并且永远不要忘记我们的斗争是一个持久的长期的斗争。
    告军民书最后称：我们现在的任务和过去一样。我们的战士们必须加强训练；后方的人民必须进行友谊的竞赛，加紧生产，增加对于抗战的贡献；我们的干部必须在遵守勤、俭、廉洁和正直的革命美德上彼此竞赛；而我国各阶层人民也必须加强团结。由于国际局势发展对我们有利、民主阵营的支持以及我们人民团结的不可征服的力量，我确信，我们的爱国战争将会获得更大的进展，而我们明年的胜利也会比一九五○年的胜利更为伟大。
    我们的长期斗争必将胜利。
    我们的国家必将获得统一与独立。
    战斗员，男女同胞们，前进罢！
