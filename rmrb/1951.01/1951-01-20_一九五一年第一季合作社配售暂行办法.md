Page: 2

The All-China Federation of Cooperatives has decided to implement, starting in the first quarter of 1951, a trial of quantitative and fixed-price rationing for members of well-managed cooperatives, providing the following daily necessities to members at low prices:

　　Rice Flour Millet Corn Sorghum Salt White Sugar Alkali Noodles Kerosene Coal
　　Cotton Cloth

The types and quantitative standards of goods to be rationed by local cooperatives in the first quarter will be separately stipulated according to the different living habits of the South and North, urban and rural areas.

In addition to the rationed goods uniformly stipulated by the All-China Federation of Cooperatives, cooperatives at all levels, with the approval of the provincial/municipal cooperative federations, may increase one or several kinds of commodities for rationing according to the needs of the members and under possible conditions (such as non-staple food, soap, matches, knitwear, toothbrushes, toothpaste, etc.). The price and quantitative standards shall be determined by the cooperatives themselves, implemented after approval by the provincial/municipal cooperative federations, and reported to the Greater Administrative Region and the All-China Federation of Cooperatives for record.

Article 2: For all rationed goods uniformly stipulated by the All-China Federation of Cooperatives, the All-China Federation of Cooperatives shall formulate a plan according to the region, number of members, types of rationed goods, and quantitative standards, and one month before the beginning of each quarter, the Ministry of Trade and the All-China Federation of Cooperatives shall jointly notify local specialized companies and provincial/municipal cooperative federations to handle the procedures for allocating goods.

Article 3: The brands and quality of rationed goods supplied to cooperatives by the Ministry of Trade shall be based on the brands of goods listed by local companies, and preferential discounts shall be given according to the local wholesale listed prices as follows (when supplying similar goods with quality standards higher or lower than the listed goods, the price should be determined according to the reasonable price difference between the supplied goods and the listed goods, plus the preferential discount):

　　Rice 7%, Flour 7%, Coarse Grains 7%, Salt 7%, White Sugar 8%, Alkali Noodles 10%, Coal 8%, Kerosene 12%, Various Cotton Cloth 6%.

The prices of rationed goods at the grassroots cooperative level should be uniformly stipulated in the same region (city or county), and must be significantly lower than the local state-owned retail prices and retail market prices. The handling of cooperative rationing prices, expenses, losses, and profits shall be temporarily handled according to the following methods:

　　(1) The prices of rationed goods at the grassroots cooperative level shall be drafted by the county (city) federation, submitted to the provincial federation for approval and implementation, and summarized by the provincial federation and reported to the Greater Administrative Region and the All-China Federation of Cooperatives for record. The rationing prices of grassroots cooperatives directly under the Central Government and the Greater Administrative Region shall be drafted by the municipal federation, submitted to the Greater Administrative Region and the All-China Federation of Cooperatives for approval and implementation.

　　In the event of price fluctuations, in order to avoid losses, the retail and wholesale prices of cooperatives shall be converted into one or several kinds of physical objects with reference to local conditions.

　　(2) Before the All-China Federation of Cooperatives issues uniform regulations, the standards for various expenses and losses of rationed goods shall be temporarily handled in the following ways:

　　　　1. The retail expense and loss standards of grassroots cooperatives shall be formulated by the county (city) federation according to the actual situation and reported to the provincial (municipal) federation for approval. The provincial federation shall review, summarize, and report to the Greater Administrative Region and the All-China Federation of Cooperatives for record.

　　　　2. The wholesale expense and loss standards of the county (city) federation shall be formulated by the county (city) federation according to the actual situation and approved by the provincial federation. The provincial federation shall summarize and report to the Greater Administrative Region and the All-China Federation of Cooperatives for record.

　　　　3. The wholesale expense and loss standards of the municipal federation directly under the Central Government and the Greater Administrative Region shall be formulated by the municipal federation according to the actual situation and reported to the Greater Administrative Region and the All-China Federation of Cooperatives for approval.

　　(3) The gross profit margin of cooperatives managing rationed goods shall be determined only after checking the actual expenses and loss rate of the first quarter's rationing. The current provisional net profit standards are as follows:

　　　　1. The net profit of grassroots cooperatives is 1%.

　　　　2. The wholesale net profit of the general cooperative above the county (city) level responsible for purchasing and wholesaling rationed goods to grassroots cooperatives shall not exceed 0.5%.

　　　　3. The general cooperatives above the provincial (municipal) level, which do not directly handle the wholesale and rationing of goods, are only responsible for planning, organizing, and inspection, and do not charge handling fees.

Article 4: The first quarter's rationing plan is of a trial nature. The targets of rationing shall be selected by the cooperative federations of the major administrative regions to implement in several consumer cooperatives of factories, organs, and schools in several cities and several supply and marketing cooperatives in rural areas. Citizen members of urban street consumer cooperatives will not be rationed for the time being.

　　Grassroots cooperatives selected to enjoy rationing benefits must meet the following conditions:

　　(1) Engage in consumer business, purchase goods according to the needs of members; except for unsalable goods, retail sales are only to members, not to non-members.

　　(2) Clear accounts, settle accounts on time, and publish to members on time.

　　(3) Fill out and submit accounting and statistical reports to the county and city cooperative federations on time, and have monthly or quarterly retail plans.

　　(4) The directors and supervisors of the cooperative are elected by the members, not appointed by the higher authorities; the board of directors, supervisory board, and member representative assembly hold meetings on time, and faithfully implement the resolutions of these meetings, truly serve the members, and enjoy prestige among the members.

Grassroots cooperatives that do not meet the above conditions and have had cases of corruption, theft, arrears, waste, speculation, etc., and have not been dealt with, will not be rationed.

Article 5: The qualification for members to enjoy rationing in the first quarter is limited to those who applied to join the cooperative unit before the end of 1950, paid shares, and obtained membership. Members who enjoy rationing in the second, third, and fourth quarters are limited to those who joined the unit two months before the beginning of the quarter. Child members under the age of ten will temporarily be rationed at half the fixed quantity for various rationed items, and white sugar will be rationed at the full quantity (people outside the unit should not join the cooperative of the unit as members, and should be transferred to the cooperative of the location unit).

Article 6: After the grassroots cooperative purchases rationed goods from a specialized company or a higher-level cooperative, it should store them separately and not mix them with general retail goods, and should immediately notify the members of the commodity category, quantity, price, purchase period, and method to come and purchase.

Article 7: Members must use ration coupons to purchase rationed goods from grassroots cooperatives. The ration coupons shall be printed and distributed by the provincial and municipal cooperative federations according to the format formulated by the All-China Federation of Cooperatives. The county and city cooperative federations shall distribute them to the grassroots cooperatives in accordance with the provisions of Article 4 of these Measures. After receiving the ration coupons, the grassroots cooperatives shall register the name of the cooperative, the name, age, and gender of the member according to the number, and affix the seal of the cooperative on the blank perforation on the right side of each coupon, and distribute it to the members in accordance with the provisions of Article 5 of these Measures, one for each person, as a voucher for members to purchase rationed goods from the cooperative. The regulations on the use of ration coupons are as follows:

　　(1) When a member purchases rationed goods, they should hand over the entire ration coupon to the cooperative salesperson. The salesperson will check that the ration coupon number and name are correct, tear off the ration coupon for the month in which the member wants to buy the goods, and return the remaining part to the member for safekeeping in person.

　　(2) The ration coupon for this period is only valid for use in the months specified in the first quarter of 1951, and will be invalid after the expiration date.

　　(3) The ration coupon is for personal use only, and may not be lent to others or used in other cooperatives. Each person is only allowed to receive one ration coupon for personal use, and is not allowed to receive it under a false name. Violators will be warned or have their rationing suspended for a period of time, or even expelled from the cooperative.

　　(4) The ration coupon should be properly kept by the member, and will not be reissued if lost.

Article 8: The purchase and retail of rationed goods must be accounted for separately. At the end of the month, the rationed goods must be settled separately and reported to the superior cooperative for review.

　　After the salesperson collects the ration coupons, the accountant shall paste the same type of ration coupons for the same period into a book and indicate the total quantity as the original voucher for the sale of rationed goods.

Article 9: Cooperatives implementing rationing must strictly abide by the following regulations:

　　(1) Rationed goods must not be sold to members or non-members who do not meet the provisions of Article 5 of these Measures.

　　(2) Rationed goods from state-owned companies or wholesale rationed goods from higher-level companies must ensure "accurate scales, full measures, and sufficient sizes," and must not increase or decrease the quantity, adulterate, make damp, or replace with inferior goods. If the rationed goods are insufficient for special reasons and the average quantity per person must be reduced, it must be approved by the members' assembly.

　　(3) Rationed goods must be sold at the prices stipulated by the higher-level cooperative, and the rationing prices must not be changed without authorization.

　　(4) Do not falsely report the number of members or purchase goods under false names.

　　(5) Do not specially increase the rationing quantity of certain individuals and relatives and friends or specially reduce the rationing quantity of certain individual members.

　　(6) Do not falsely report expenses and losses.

　　(7) Submit rationing statistics and planning reports and settle rationing accounts on time in accordance with the regulations of the higher authorities.

　　(8) Grassroots cooperatives and county and city cooperative federations must report the category and quantity of remaining rationed goods to the superior cooperative and the original supply agency for record on a monthly and quarterly basis. The remaining rationed goods should be returned to the original supply agency; they may not be disposed of without the approval of the original supply agency.

　　Cooperative staff must conscientiously implement the above regulations and must not violate them; if there are violations of the above regulations, the cooperative may be notified, or subject to administrative or legal sanctions or suspension of rationing depending on the severity of the circumstances. Individual staff members will be warned, dismissed, or subject to legal sanctions.

Article 10: The following provisions are made regarding the supervision and inspection of rationing work:

　　(1) Cooperative members, supervisory boards, superior cooperatives, state-owned trading agencies, etc. have the right to supervise or inspect at any time whether the cooperative is implementing the rationing business in accordance with these Measures.

　　(2) The Supervisory Board shall formally inspect the implementation of the rationing business once a month and report at the meeting of the members' assembly or representative assembly.

　　(3) The superior cooperative may send personnel to inspect at any time.

　　(4) State-owned trading agencies may appoint special personnel to conduct inspections when necessary.

(Note: The four conditions that the grassroots cooperative enjoying rationing benefits must meet in Article 4 of these Measures are different from those mentioned in Vice Director Cheng Zihua's report in terms of the length of the text, but the two are consistent in spirit. The regulations in these Measures are more detailed and should be followed during implementation.)
