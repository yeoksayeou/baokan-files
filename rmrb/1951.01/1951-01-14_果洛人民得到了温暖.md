Qinghai Correspondence

　　The Golog People Have Received Warmth
    Shi Linxiang Zhang Yang
    "Shi Dang, Shi Dang Qu"!

    After Qinghai's liberation last year, when the good news "The Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army have good policies, and the price of wool has risen" spread to the Golog area, they thought it was a lie. However, the facts gradually educated them and dispelled their doubts.

    Once, when they went to Daheba for business, they saw the People's Liberation Army working hard and intensely to repair the road. They approached and greeted them warmly, asking them to rest and drink water; the Tibetan tents along both sides of the road were even more numerous than before. They asked their fellow tribesmen suspiciously: "Do the People's Liberation Army make you repair roads?" "Do they beat you?" The answers made them feel both fresh and excited. In July, the Ashi Qiang people transported wool to Xiangride (belonging to Dulan) to sell it, and happened to meet Hu Zhenbang (a Lusha'er person, Hui ethnicity), a businessman who used to travel to the Golog area ten years ago. They shook hands happily and talked for a long time. "What exactly are the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army like?" They eagerly wanted to find the answer to the question that had been hanging in their hearts for a long time. Hu Zhenbang told them everything in detail.

    --The Communist Party, the People's Liberation Army, and the People's Government are really good. They treat Han, Manchu, Mongolian, Hui, Tibetan...all equally.

    --Doing business is fair and just, and the harmful De Xinghai has been overthrown.

    --The price of wool has increased unprecedentedly!

    This was the same as what they saw in Daheba and Xiangride. They kept thinking about what Hu Zhenbang had said to them: "Let's go, let's go down to do business and see the People's Government and the Communist Party!"

    When they returned and told Longbu and all the masses everything, after everyone discussed it, they still dared not fully believe these words were true. Finally, they decided: "Shi Dang, Shi Dang Qu!" (meaning "Let's try it out") They sent Xianba Longbu as the leader, a total of forty-three people, driving more than 500 yaks carrying local goods, with uneasy hearts, heading towards Huangyuan and Xining, which they had been separated from for thirty years.

    "The First Time We Felt Warmth"

    When they arrived in Huangyuan, they went to the trading company and received warm hospitality and convenience. In particular, the public sector casually invited them to a simple meal, and they said that the public sector really treated them like human beings. All the goods the company wanted were bought at a fair price, and the things they needed were sold to them fairly. Great convenience and assistance were given in transportation and other aspects. In particular, the weighing was fair, which made their wool weigh more. They learned about the People's Government from these specific examples. Later, whenever they traded with private merchants, they always used the trading company's scale as the standard. When they first arrived, a Golog person bought cloth for four yuan but only got three yuan's worth of cloth in a private shop. After the trading company found out, they immediately recovered it for them. They were moved by how good the "public people" were. When their representatives met the provincial chairman in the province, they were treated with great respect. They were also invited to watch movies, eat meals, and given gifts, and were issued the flag of the traveling merchants. They were so happy that they couldn't describe it. At that time, the Seventh Central Epidemic Prevention Team, which was in Huangyuan, treated their illnesses, gave them a banner that read "All Nationalities are Equal," and took photos with them. Xianba gathered the Golog people who came with him and said: "This is the first time we have received warmth! The Communist Party is so good to us, how should we thank them?" They said: "Chairman Mao is Nima (the sun)." They asked for many photos of Chairman Mao and carefully preserved them. He said they would take them back and enshrine them in their tents. Xianba said that in the years when they were slaughtered and blockaded by the Ma Bufang bandits, their local products could not be transported out, and their lives were extremely poor. Chairman Mao's government treated them like human beings, even better than their own parents. He gave an example: at that time, they went as far as Ganzi and other places, and one hundred catties of wool could only be exchanged for fifty catties of flour. Now, one hundred catties of wool can be exchanged for more than seven hundred catties of flour (their wool costs thirty-five yuan per hundred catties, and one yuan can buy more than twenty catties of flour). The price of wool has increased fourteen times. This time when they went back, they brought back large quantities of flour, rice, cloth, and daily necessities. Many people bought porcelain daily furniture and toys for their children. Xianba said regretfully: "We didn't know before that the People's Government really treated us all equally. This time we brought too few goods. We must do business well in the future." For decades, their local products had been滞留. Today, they have gained the opportunity to sell them smoothly, and no one wants to live a poor life while guarding their goods. The Golog area has a lot of wool and cattle hides. The Golog people urgently need daily necessities and hope that merchants will bring goods there.

    From contempt and slaughter to equality, from goods being abandoned on the ground and suffering to free trade and fair exchange. The Golog people clearly know who gave them this. They answer their questions with these words: "Ma Bufang's bandits were like a thick snow, people couldn't walk, cattle couldn't eat grass. Chairman Mao came like a red sun, melting the ice and snow, people got warmth, and cattle and sheep got grass to eat."

　　果洛人民得到了温暖
    石麟祥　张扬
    “试当，试当去”！
    去年青海解放后，当“共产党解放军政策好，羊毛涨价了”这样的喜讯传到果洛区后，他们觉得这是假话。但是，事实逐渐教育他们释去了疑虑。
    有一次他们经商到大河坝去，看见了解放军勤苦、紧张的修路。他们走近了，还和他们亲热地打招呼，让他们休息下来喝水；沿路两旁的藏民帐房，比以前还多了起来。他们怀疑地问他们的同族人民：“解放军不拉你们修路吗？”“不打你们吗？”回答使他们感到又新鲜又兴奋。七月间，阿什羌族把羊毛运到香日德（属都兰）去卖，巧遇到十年以前常跑果洛区的商人虎镇邦（鲁沙尔人，回族），高兴地握住手长久地谈话之后，“共产党、解放军倒底是怎么样子？”他们迫切地想找到他们久悬心中的疑难的答案，虎镇邦把一切的情形都详细讲给了他们。
    ——共产党、解放军、人民政府真好。不管汉、满、蒙、回、藏……一律平等看待。
    ——做生意公买公卖，把害人的德兴海打倒了。
    ——羊毛价格空前的提高了！
    这和他们在大河坝、香日德看见的情形一样，他们一直作念着虎镇邦对他们说的话：“走吧，我们下去做生意去，看看人民政府、共产党去！”
    当他们回去，把一切都告诉给隆布和所有群众以后，大家商量的结果，还不敢十分相信这些话是真的，最后决定：“试当，试当去！”（试探之意）派显巴隆布为领队，一共四十三人，赶犏毛牛五百余头，驮载上土货，怀着忐忑的心情，向别了三十年的湟源、西宁进发。
    “第一次感到了温暖”
    当他们到达湟源的时候，他们去找贸易公司，得到了热烈的招待和便利，尤其公家顺便请他吃了顿便饭，他们说公家真是把他们当人。所有的货物，公司要的都按照公平价格买了下来，并把他们需要的东西都公道的卖给他们。在运输等方面给了极大的便利和帮助。特别是秤公道，使他们的羊毛都长了秤，他们更从这些具体的事例中认识了人民政府。后来他们每和私商交易，总要拿贸易公司的秤作标准。初来的时候，一个果洛人，在私商铺子里买布，四块钱买了三块钱的布，贸易公司知道后，即刻替他们找了回来。“公家人”这样好，感动了他们。当他们的代表到省上见了省主席备受尊重，还请他们看电影、吃饭、送礼物，并发给了他们旅商队的旗帜，他们高兴得没法形容。当时正在湟源的中央防疫第七大队替他们治了病，又送给他们“各民族一律平等”的锦旗，还和他们照了相。显巴招集这次同来的果洛人开会说：“这是我们第一次得到的温暖！共产党对我们这样好，我们应当怎样来感谢呢？”他们说：“毛主席是尼马（太阳）”。他们要了许多毛主席的照片，珍重地保存起来，他说他们要带回去供在帐篷里。显巴说，他们在被马匪步芳屠杀、封锁的年月里，土产运不出来，日子穷困至极，毛主席的政府把他们当了人，比亲娘老子还好。他举个例子：在那时候，他们远到甘孜等地去，一百斤羊毛，只换到五十斤面，现在一百斤羊毛，可以换到七百多斤面（他们的羊毛每百斤三十五元，一元二十多斤面），毛价提高了十四倍。这次他们回去的时候，大量的带回了面，大米、布匹、日常用具，许多人都买到洋瓷日用家具和孩子的玩具。显巴惋惜地说：“我们以前还不知道人民政府真的对我们一律平等，这回带的货太少了，以后要很好做生意。”几十年来，他们的土货都在滞留着，今天得到了畅销的机会，谁也不愿意守着货物过穷苦日子。果洛区的羊毛牛皮是极多的，果洛人民迫切地希望生活必需品，希望商人带货到那里去。
    从贱视杀戮到一律平等，从货弃于地饱受困苦到自由交易公平交换。果洛族人民清楚地知道这是谁给予他们的。他们用这样的话来回答他们的问题：“马匪步芳像一场厚雪，人不能走路，牛不能吃草，毛主席来了好像红太阳，照融了冰雪，人们得到了温暖，牛羊得到了草吃。”
