　　Forest Fires Occur Continuously in Zunhua, Hebei
    County People's Armed Forces Department Calls on Militiamen to Prevent Fires and Guard Against Special Agents

Editor Comrade:
    Since the beginning of winter, forest fires have been occurring continuously in the mountains and forests of Zunhua County, Hebei Province, causing damage to the property of our people's motherland and affecting the development of future afforestation work. For example, on November 10, 1950, 40 mu of forest in the eastern mountain of Da'anlezhuang in the tenth district was burned, killing 3,000 small pine trees. On December 15, the fire spread from the northern mountain of Xujiatao to Da'anlezhuang, destroying more than 100 mu of forest and killing more than 20,000 newly planted small pine trees. In the lower part of Tagou on the northern mountain of Chanlin Temple in the ninth district, a fire broke out at 12:00 noon on December 29. It was extinguished by Zhang Chaofu, director of the forest protection committee, and the masses, including Liu Fang, at 12:00 midnight. As a result, 70 mu of forest area was destroyed, killing 4,500 white jujube trees, 3,000 Boluo trees, and 6,400 small pine trees, a total of 13,900 trees. In the three fires, a total of 36,900 trees of various sizes were burned to death.
    In order to strictly prevent the recurrence of such incidents, the County People's Armed Forces Department convened a meeting of armed forces ministers from various districts on January 7, 1951, to specifically study the issue of fire prevention. It was decided to raise vigilance to prevent sabotage by bad elements, and to call on all militiamen in the county to actively participate, strengthen patrols and sentry duty, conscientiously protect the mountains and forests, cherish state property, and help the masses realize the slogan "Rely on the mountains for a living, must nurture the mountains."

                           Huang Mao, Deputy Minister of the People's Armed Forces Department of Zunhua County, Hebei

　　河北遵化山林连续发生火灾
    县人民武装部号召民兵防火防特编辑同志：
    河北遵化县的山林，自入冬以来，不断发生火灾，使人民祖国的财产遭受到损失，影响了今后造林工作的开展。例如：十区大安乐庄东山，在一九五○年十一月十日烧了四十亩的山林，烧死了小松树三千棵。十二月十五日，又从徐家套北山一直烧到大安乐庄，烧毁一百多亩的山林，烧死新栽的小松树两万多棵。九区禅林寺北山塔沟下部，在十二月二十九日上午十二点钟着火，经护林委员会主任张朝福和群众刘方等打到夜间十二点钟才打灭了，结果烧毁山林面积七十亩，烧死白枣树四千五百棵，菠落树三千棵，小松树六千四百棵，共烧死一万三千九百棵。前后三次共烧死各种大小树木三万六千九百棵。
    县人民武装部为了严加防止再有此种事件的发生，一九五一年一月七日召开了各区武装部长会议，专门研究了防火问题。决定提高警惕以防坏分子的破坏，并号召全县民兵积极活动，加强巡逻会哨，切实认真的保护山林，爱护国家财产，帮助群众实现“靠山吃山，必得养山”的口号。
