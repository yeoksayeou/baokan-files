　　Director Su Younong Informs the Universal Postal Union
    Our Representative Will Attend the Postal Union Conference
    [Xinhua News Agency, 9th] On December 11th of last year, Dr. Hess, Secretary-General of the Executive and Liaison Committee of the Universal Postal Union, telegraphed Director Su Younong of the Chinese Postal Administration, informing him that the joint meeting of the Executive and Liaison Committee of the Universal Postal Union and the International Air Transport Association would be held in Cairo on January 22, 1951. However, regarding the attendance of representatives of the People's Republic of China at this meeting, the telegram stated that the issue of Chinese representation would need to be decided at the Cairo meeting. In response, Director Su Younong telegraphed Dr. Hess on January 9th, pointing out that this constituted an unwarranted obstruction to the issue of the representation of the Postal Administration of the People's Republic of China in the Universal Postal Union, which had already been resolved at the Montreux Conference, and was completely without justification. Director Su Younong was instructed to inform him that the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China has appointed Su Younong as its representative, Ge Baoquan as advisor, and Xu Chuanjian as attendant to attend the aforementioned meeting in Cairo. He was requested to immediately liaise with the Egyptian government to arrange entry procedures for our representatives.

　　苏幼农局长电知万国邮政联盟
    我代表将出席邮政联盟会议
    【新华社九日讯】去年十二月十一日，万国邮政联盟执行及联络委员会秘书长赫斯博士致电通知我国邮政总局苏幼农局长，万国邮政联盟执行及联络委员会与国际航空运输协会商谈的联席会议即将于一九五一年一月二十二日在开罗召开。但对我中华人民共和国代表出席此次会议事，来电竟称，中国代表权问题需待开罗会议决定。苏幼农局长为此于一月九日致电赫斯博士指出这是对蒙特罗会议已经解决的中华人民共和国邮政当局参加万国邮政联盟的代表权问题，给予不应有的阻碍，这是完全没有理由的。苏幼农局长并奉命通知他：中华人民共和国中央人民政府已任命苏幼农为代表，戈宝权为顾问，徐传坚为随员出席上述在开罗召开的会议。请他即与埃及政府为我代表洽办入境手续。
