The Friendship Between Chinese and German Peasants

Last September, the diplomatic delegation and commercial delegation of the German Democratic Republic visited the peasants of Heita Village in the 13th District of the suburbs of Beijing, and gave them many gifts. The village head and the director of the farmers' association of the village wrote a letter on behalf of the farmers, asking them to take it to the German farmers to pay tribute to the German farmer brothers. This letter was published in the "Neues Deutschland" newspaper and was first seen by the farmers of Dolgelin village in Germany, who immediately wrote back to the Chinese farmers of Heita Village. In these two letters, the brotherly friendship and great internationalist spirit of the Chinese and German peasants are fully expressed. Although the two places are far apart and the texts are different, these difficulties cannot hinder the exchange of friendship between the Chinese and German people. Now, these two letters are published together, and the photo of the Dolgelin village farmers writing back to the Heita village farmers is also published.

To Mr. Koenig, Head of the Diplomatic Mission of the German Democratic Republic, and Mr. Ziller, Head of the Commercial Delegation of the German Democratic Republic:

Thank you for the generous gifts you gave to our village. All the farmers in our village are determined to continue to work hard and increase production to answer your friendly congratulations. Please convey to the German farmer brothers that the Chinese farmers send their greetings to them. We will stand with them and strive together for lasting world peace, and wish them a good harvest this year!

Dear Friends!

We read your letter to the diplomatic mission of the German Democratic Republic in the "Neues Deutschland" (Central Organ of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany), and we accept your brotherly greetings with joy and gratitude, and we extend our sincere greetings to you in the same way! From that news, we learned how much the victory of the glorious and great Chinese People's Liberation Army and the democratic land reform have brought to your lives.

Dolgelin village also experienced war, and eighty percent was destroyed. After most of the fleeing residents returned, our rectification work began. Soon after, land reform was implemented. Five hundred and ninety-five hectares of land belonging to large landlords were distributed to one hundred and thirty-seven new farmers and landless peasants, many of whom had lost their homes in the fascist war and found a new home here.

In our area, land reform is also the beginning of a new era, which has made our economy prosperous and developed. As we know, after the land reform, your harvest has increased by an average of one-third. Thanks to our diligent labor, mutual assistance, effective government measures, and the great help of mechanical stations, we have also achieved remarkable results. For example, our horses have increased from five in 1945 to ninety-seven this year; we now have four hundred and sixty-seven cattle, six hundred and fifty-six pigs, and one hundred and ninety-one sheep. In 1945, we didn't even have one of these livestock. When Hitler's Germany collapsed, we had no machines, no machine rental stations, and no kindergartens; even the schools had to be rebuilt.

If we look back at 1945, our achievements are not small.

On October 15, our entire village decided to respond to the government's call and expressed our firm will for peace, unity, and improved living. We believe that friendship with all peace-loving nations, especially with the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, is the best foundation for further prosperity.

Therefore, we extend our sincere friendship to the farmers of Heita Village, and wish our Chinese friends continuous victories in continued construction and in the growth of the peace camp. With brotherly greetings,
Dolgelin Village E. Pufutznal (new farm woman), K. Schneider (new director of farmers' mutual aid), H. Vogel (new farmer, head of the village agricultural association), H. Stud (farmer), E. Bartosha (local leader of the German Farmers Party), O. Timen (farmer)

### 中德农民的友谊

　　中德农民的友谊
    去年九月民主德国的外交使团和商务代表团，访问了北京市郊第十三区黑塔村的农民，并送给他们许多礼物。该村村长及农会主任代表农民们写了一封信，请他们带给德国的农民，向德国农民弟兄们致敬。这封信在《新德意志》报上刊出，首先被德国多尔格林村的农民们看到了，便立刻向黑塔村的中国农民写了一封回信。在这两封来往信件中，充分洋溢着中德农民兄弟般的友谊，和伟大的国际主义精神。虽然两地距离很远，文字又不相同，可是这些困难是阻碍不了中德人民间友情的交流的。现在把这两封信一齐发表于后，并将多尔格林村农民们给黑塔村农民写回信时的照片，也一并刊出。
    德意志民主共和国外交使团团长柯尼希先生暨德意志民主共和国商业代表团团长齐勒先生：
    感谢你们送给我村的厚礼。我们全村农民决继续努力，增加生产来回答你们友谊的祝贺。请转告德国的农民弟兄，中国农民向他们问好。我们将和他们站在一起，为争取世界持久和平共同奋斗，祝他们今年收成良好！
      中华人民共和国北京第十三区黑塔村
          村长  程国玉
          农会主任  陈和
          一九五○年九月八日亲爱的朋友们！
    我们在《新德意志》（德意志统一社会党中央机关报）上面读到你们给德意志民主共和国外交使团的信，我们既快乐又感谢地接受了你们的兄弟的致候，也以同样的至诚来向你们致敬！从那个消息中我们知道了：光荣伟大的中国人民解放军的胜利和民主的土地改革，在你们的生活中带来了何等的改变。
    在多尔格林（Dolgelin）村也遭遇过战争，有百分之八十受到破坏，当逃走的居民大部分回来之后，我们的整顿工作就开始了。此后，不久就实行了土地改革。五百九十五公顷大地主的土地分配给一百三十七个新农民和没有土地的农民了，其中有许多是在法西斯战争中失去了家乡，又在我们这里重新找到了归宿。
    在我们这儿，土地改革也同样是一个新时代的起始，使得我们的经济繁荣发展。如我们所知道的，在土地改革之后，你们的收成平均增加了三分之一，我们由于勤勉的劳动，彼此的互助，政府的有效措施以及机械站的伟大帮助，也已经得到了显著的成绩。例如：我们的马匹从一九四五年的五匹增加到了今年的九十七匹；我们现在有四百六十七头牛，六百五十六个猪和一百九十一只羊。在一九四五年的时候，这类牲畜我们连一个也没有。在希特勒德国溃败的时候，我们没有任何机器，没有机器出租站，没有幼稚园；连学校也得重新建立。
    如果我们回顾一下一九四五年，我们的成就已经不算少了。
    在十月十五日，我们全村决定响应政府的号召，表示了为和平、统一和改善生活的坚决意志。我们相信，和所有爱好和平的民族之间的友谊，尤其是和苏联的以及人民民主国家之间的友谊，是进一步繁荣的最好基础。
    因此，我们以诚挚的友情向黑塔村的农民们致候，并祝我们中国朋友们在继续建设中，和在和平阵营的壮大中不断的胜利。此致兄弟的敬礼
