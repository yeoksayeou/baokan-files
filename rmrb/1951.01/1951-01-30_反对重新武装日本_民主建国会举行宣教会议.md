　　Opposing the Rearmament of Japan
    Democratic National Construction Association Holds Propaganda Meeting
    [This newspaper's dispatch] The Democratic National Construction Association held a propaganda meeting on the 27th. Zhang Jiongbo, Yang Weiyu, Sun Xiaocun, Yu Huancheng, Zhang Yuanshan, Zhou Shiguan, Jin Changyou, Fan Yaofeng, Ai Zhicheng and others attended, chaired by Zhang Naiqi. The meeting focused on and decided to make opposing the US imperialists' separate conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan, the rearmament of Japan, and launching Spring Festival support for the army and relief for Korean refugees the current concrete propaganda and education work. It was unanimously agreed that the US imperialists have no sincerity in peacefully mediating the Korean issue. They are stepping up the mobilization of reinforcements, attempting to make a final struggle in Korea. The recent visit of Dulles to Japan to conduct a unilateral peace treaty with Japan, attempting to further arm Japan, also shows that the US imperialists' aggressive conspiracy is intensifying. The people of the whole country, especially patriotic people in the business community, must heighten their vigilance and use more resolute practical actions to consolidate and expand the great victory of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement.

　　反对重新武装日本
    民主建国会举行宣教会议
    【本报讯】民主建国会二十七日举行宣教会议，出席张絅伯、杨卫玉、孙晓村、俞寰澄、章元善、周士观、金长佑、范尧峰、艾志诚等，由章乃器主持。会上着重讨论并决定以反对美帝单独缔结对日和约、重新武装日本及发动春节劳军和救济朝鲜难民为当前具体的宣传教育工作。一致认为：美帝毫无和平调处朝鲜问题的诚意，它正加紧动员增兵，企图在朝鲜做最后挣扎。最近杜勒斯赴日本进行片面对日媾和企图进一步武装日本的活动，也足见美帝的侵略阴谋正在变本加厉。全国人民尤其工商界爱国人士必须提高警觉，用更坚决的实际行动来巩固与扩大抗美援朝运动的伟大胜利。
