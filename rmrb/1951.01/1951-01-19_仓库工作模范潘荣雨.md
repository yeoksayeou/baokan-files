　　Warehouse Work Model Pan Rongyu
　　Comrade Pan Rongyu is the director of the Jianyang Special District Directly Subordinate Grain Depot in Fujian Province. He is active and responsible in his work. At the commendation meeting of the Special District Grain Bureau, he was praised unanimously by those present.
　　In May and June of last year, the directly subordinate grain depot stored more than 500,000 jin of brown rice. When the weather is hot and there is too much rice stored, it is extremely easy to generate heat, produce insects, change flavor, or become moldy. In order to avoid this situation, Comrade Rongyu led all the cadres in the warehouse to turn the warehouse over every day. When it rained at night, he got up to check whether the warehouse was leaking. In order to prevent illegal elements from destroying or stealing public grain, he often personally stood guard at night. This diligent spirit of being responsible for the people's property moved all the comrades in the depot. With everyone's concerted efforts, more than 500,000 jin of brown rice did not have a single grain of mold in the hot summer, and the stored large quantities of paddy did not exceed the prescribed erosion and consumption standards.
　　After the task of delivering public grain from the depot was completed, Comrade Pan Rongyu was dispatched to assist in the construction of the central grain depot in northern Fujian. Based on his past experience in keeping public grain, he believes that the reasons for the heating and insect infestation of grain in the warehouse, in addition to the quality of the grain, are also due to the incomplete and unscientific warehouse equipment. So he designed the method of "live warehouse wall" and "inner door of the granary" (we hope that the construction engineers of the depot will send us a letter about the design of this project so that it can be promoted - Editor), which can make the air circulate in the warehouse and facilitate the turning of the warehouse.
　　Comrade Pan Rongyu is very careful in his work and does not allow any carelessness. One day, when he went to inspect a sub-depot of a certain central grain depot where the warehouse was under construction, he found that out of the sixty-six warehouse pillars that had been planed, sixty had been eaten by insects. If they were used to build the grain depot, it would inevitably cause the public grain stored in the warehouse to be corroded by insects. Comrade Rongyu severely criticized this perfunctory work style and ordered the new pillars to be rebuilt.
　　Comrade Rongyu was born into a worker's family and has never been to school, but under the cultivation and education of the Party, he is now able to write reports to the higher authorities. He has unlimited enthusiasm and loyalty to revolutionary work. Engineer Lin Xidi often said: "Old Pan's thoughts and talks all day long are about repairing warehouses, collecting grain, and transferring and storing grain."

### 仓库工作模范潘荣雨

　　仓库工作模范潘荣雨
    潘荣雨同志是福建省建阳专区直属粮库的主任，他工作积极负责，在专区粮食局的评功大会上，受到蒞者一致赞扬。
    去年五、六月间，直属粮库储存糙米五十余万斤。天热存米太多，是极容易发热、生虫、变味或霉烂的。为避免这种情况，荣雨同志领导全仓干部天天翻仓，夜里下雨，他便起床去检查仓库是否漏雨。为防备不法分子破坏或偷盗公粮，他经常亲自在夜里放哨站岗。这种为人民财产负责的勤劳精神，感动了该库的全体同志，在大家一致努力下，终于使五十余万斤糙米在火热的夏天，没有一粒霉烂，保管的大批稻谷也没有超过规定蚀耗标准。
    该库公粮上解任务完毕后，潘荣雨同志被派往协助修建全闽北的中央粮库。根据他过去保管公粮的经验，他认为仓库粮食发热、生虫的原因，除了因为粮食质量有问题以外，仓库设备不够完备和不够科学也是主要原因。于是他设计了“活仓壁”与“廒内门”的办法（希望该库修建工程人员把这个工程的设计来信告诉我们，以便推广——编者），这样能使仓内空气流通，并便于倒仓。
    潘荣雨同志对工作非常细心，毫不苟且。某天，他去某中央粮库的支库检查正在修建的仓库时，发现已刨好了的六十六根仓柱中，有六十根被虫蚀过，如果用来修筑粮库，必然要使仓存公粮遭虫腐蚀。荣雨同志严厉地批评了这种敷衍塞责的工作作风，并令重作新柱。
    荣雨同志出身于工人家庭，从来没有念过书，但在党的培养教育下，现在已能向上级写报告了。他对革命工作抱有无限热情和忠心。林锡锑工程师常说：“老潘一天到晚说的想的不是修仓收粮，就是调运保管。”
