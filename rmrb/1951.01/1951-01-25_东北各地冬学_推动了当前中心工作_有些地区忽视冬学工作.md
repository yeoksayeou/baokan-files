[Report from this newspaper] Winter schools in Northeast China, in coordination with current affairs studies and central tasks, continue to develop. As of December last year, according to incomplete statistics, in Heilongjiang (36 counties), Jilin, Rehe (17 counties each), Songjiang (15 counties), Liaoxi (14 counties and 4 cities), Liaodong (12 counties), and the suburbs of Lushun-Dalian and Shenyang, Benxi, and Anshan, 2,028,170 people were attending winter school (compared to 1,800,000 at the end of December 1949). In Yushu County, the number reached 166,830, accounting for 25% of the county's total population. Even in areas along the Songhua River in Liaodong, which were seriously threatened by the US imperialist aggression against Korea, winter schools were established on a large scale, with some exceeding the number of students in the winter of 1949. For example, in Ji'an County, 16,000 people attended winter school in 1949, but by December last year, more than 20,000 people were participating in the studies. Before and after the start of winter schools, various localities universally and systematically trained winter school teachers. According to incomplete statistics, a total of 30,728 people participated in the training, including 10,844 out of 28,170 winter school teachers in Heilongjiang Province alone. This has improved the quality of winter school teachers and teaching work. Many places have implemented various forms of responsibility systems in organizational leadership and teaching methods. For example, Lushun-Dalian implemented a "contract system" for village primary school teachers to lead teaching, Liaoxi promoted a "little teacher contract system" to establish "regular regional meetings," and Jilin universally established civil school principals to implement a "special responsibility system." All of these have enabled winter schools to be sustained and consolidated. During this period, rural cultural stations have also been further developed. According to preliminary statistics, there are already 899, which have played a certain role in promoting winter school work.

In winter schools, leaders in various places have been extremely serious and diligent. For example, the Ji'an County Party Committee personally arranged winter school work at the district party committee and district head meetings and emphasized doing a good job in winter schools. Various localities have also generally paid attention to combining rural central work to strengthen current affairs and political education. The methods include: classroom lectures, discussions, casual talks, newspaper reading, storytelling with drums, clapper talks, plays, cartoons, broadcasting, home visits, and conversations. For example, the Zhengyi Village Winter School in Yushu, Jilin Province, reads newspapers before and after class, and organizes students to discuss in class; the Yaogangtun Winter School teaches current affairs using maps; the Hebei Village Winter School in Panshi County, in addition to classroom lectures, also incorporates clapper talks such as "Resist America, Aid Korea"; the Aodongdatun Winter School in Ning'an County, Songjiang Province, conducts two classroom lectures every week, and winter school teachers lead discussions. Students tell their relatives and neighbors what they have learned anytime, anywhere. This has promoted the central work in rural areas, with farmers signing up to join the Volunteer Army or participating in stretcher teams, and has also set off a wave of sideline production. All the students in the village mobilized more than 90 laborers and 11 carts to go up the mountain to collect firewood, collecting more than 3,200 bundles in two days. They also organized 18 sets of harnesses to go up the mountain to pull wood.

However, at present, some local leaders still do not pay enough attention to winter school work, believing that "the situation is different this year, and winter schools can be done or not," and only focus on central work in isolation, abandoning leadership over winter schools, so that winter schools have not been well developed. For example, in Jixian County, Songjiang Province, the provincial government's instructions on winter schools were locked in the drawer of the Culture and Education Section, and were not assigned downwards for fear of hindering central work; in Fuli District of the same county, the total population of the district is more than 6,000, and more than 300 people attended winter schools in 1949, but this year only one place was set up, with only about 20 people studying; in Shihuai Town, Seventh District of Ning'an County, the winter schools in 34 villages collapsed for the most part as soon as the central work came. This deviation must be corrected.

In terms of current affairs and political education, most winter schools lack planning, teaching whatever comes to mind. For example, the teacher of Yujia Village Winter School in Ning'an County, after reading a story about the War of Resistance Against Japan, talked about the Battle of Pingxingguan. This is not only fragmented and piecemeal, but also divorced from the needs of the masses. In addition, in many places, current affairs and politics are awkwardly linked when teaching cultural classes, which disrupts the normal teaching of cultural classes.

### 东北各地冬学  推动了当前中心工作  有些地区忽视冬学工作

　　东北各地冬学
    推动了当前中心工作
    有些地区忽视冬学工作
    【本报讯】东北各地冬学，配合时事学习，结合中心工作，继续得到发展。截至去年十二月，据不完全统计，黑龙江（三十六县）、吉林、热河（各十七个县）、松江（十五县）、辽西（十四县、四市）、辽东（十二县）、旅大及沈阳、本溪、鞍山市郊区已有二百零二万八千一百七十人上冬学（一九四九年十二月底为一百八十万人）。榆树一县发展到十六万六千八百三十人，占全县总人口百分之二十五。即在辽东沿松花江一带受美帝侵朝战争严重威胁地区，亦大量办起冬学，有的并超过一九四九年冬学人数。如辑安县一九四九年有一万六千人上冬学，去年十二月即已有二万余人参加学习。各地并于冬学开始前后普遍有计划地集训了冬学教师，据不完全统计，共有三万零七百二十八人参加学习，其中黑龙江一省在二万八千一百七十名冬学教师中，即有一万零八百四十四人参加集训，这就提高了冬学师资的水平与教学工作。许多地方在组织领导与教学方法上已实行了各种各样的责任制，如旅大实行村小教员“包工制”领导教学，辽西推行“小先生包工制”建立“定期片会”，吉林普遍设民校校长实行“专责制”等，都使得冬学得以坚持和巩固。在此期间，农村文化站也得到了进一步的发展，据初步统计，已有八百九十九处，对开展冬学工作都曾起过一定的推动作用。
    在冬学中，各地领导上都极为认真和努力，如辑安县委在区委、区长会议上，亲自布置冬学工作，并强调搞好冬学。各地并普遍注意结合农村中心工作，加强进行时事政治教育。方式有：课堂讲解，讨论、漫谈、读报、说唱大鼓、快板、演戏、漫画、广播、家庭访问、谈话等。如吉林省榆树正义村冬学，在课前课后进行读报，课堂上组织学员讨论；腰岗屯冬学对着地图讲时事；磐石县河北村冬学除课堂讲解外，还结合说唱“抗美援朝”等快板；松江宁安县敖东大屯冬学，每周进行两次课堂讲解，冬学教师并领导讨论。学员把学到的东西随时随地讲给亲戚邻居听。这样就推动了农村中心工作，农民报名参加志愿军或参加担架队，并掀起了副业生产的热潮。全屯学员发动了九十多个劳动力，十一辆大车，上山打柴，在两天时间内打了三千二百多捆，又组织了十八付套子上山拉木头。
    但目前也还有些地方领导上，对冬学工作重视不够，认为“今年情况不同，冬学可搞可不搞”，只是孤立的搞中心工作，放弃对冬学的领导，以致冬学未能很好的开展起来。如松江省集贤县，把省府关于冬学指示锁在文教科抽屉里，不往下布置，怕妨碍中心工作；同县福利区全区人口六千多人，一九四九年有三百多人上冬学，今年只办起一处，学习的人只二十人左右；宁安县七区世环镇三十四个村的冬学，中心工作一来，绝大部分垮了台，这种偏向是必须加以纠正的。
    在时事政治教育上，大多数冬学是缺乏计划性的，碰到什么就讲什么，如宁安县于家村冬学教员看了抗战故事，就讲平型关大战。这样不仅材料零碎片断，且脱离了群众需要。此外，还有很多地方，在讲文化课时，生硬的联系时事政治，以致破坏了文化课的正常教学。
