　　Liu Lifu Model Production Group
    Liu Bingye
    Editor's Note: The Liu Lifu team is a model production team in Lushun City. This team has won the glorious title of "Superior Product Model Team." From January to the end of October 1950, they averaged 243 percent of their planned production each month. In terms of quality, they have consistently maintained 100 percent compliance with specifications and have been approved for inspection exemption.
    Liu Lifu Team in Battle
    Stepping into the factory gate, a large iron plate over ten feet high reads, "Learn from the Superior Quality Product Liu Lifu Team!" standing like a sentinel. Further inside, you can see Liu Lifu and all his team members, covered in sweat, forcefully forging the newly heated, red-hot small "flanges."
    A large red paper is affixed to the waist of the power hammer, with eye-catching characters written on it: "For resisting America and aiding Korea, turn hatred into strength, step up production, strengthen the power to defend the motherland and our homes. Therefore, we challenge Wang Zhaoda, who is attending the National Congress of Labor Model Representatives of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers, and challenge the Railway Factory."
    To realize their determination, they proposed "doing three blows as two blows." Lao Yu, the hammer operator, exclaimed: "I will smash the American imperialists to death with a three-ton power hammer!" In Liu Lifu's workshop, the first impression is one of unparalleled labor enthusiasm. The sound of the hammer is loud, hands and feet never stop, from firing to hammering to repairing, a series of actions are like a very precise machine, operating with skilled rhythm. Their whole team has become a unified whole.
    It is necessary to bring into play the labor enthusiasm of everyone and to work with zeal in the production competition. However, human strength is limited, and the production competition is a long-term one. You cannot have a sudden rush for ten days or half a month, exhausting people to the point of "vomiting blood," and then being finished. The Liu Lifu team does not simply increase labor intensity, but organizes labor excellently.
    Precise Division of Labor and Cooperative Labor Organization
    The Liu Lifu team has a set of skilled working methods when working. In November, the factory's tasks were all small jobs. The factory has three small electric hammers and one large power hammer. It is too wasteful to use the power hammer for small jobs, and the three small electric hammers cannot supply the needs of each production team. The Liu Lifu team proposed: "Resist America and aid Korea, overcome difficulties, do not use the power hammer, and exceed the task." To realize this slogan, Liu Lifu divided the seven people in his team into three groups according to their technical abilities. Each group ensured that "the bottom is struck first, the top is struck slowly, and they work together." Liu Lifu led Liu Likuan and Yu Long to make the more difficult hexagonal screw caps. As soon as Liu Lifu finished one blow, Liu Likuan handed over the coil, and after another three or five blows, Yu Long immediately put on the iron sleeve (tool) and dropped the workpiece. This set of work is as fast as passing a ball. Liu Shujin and Yu Zhenfa were making screws. You can only see the movement of their hands, not the movement of their feet. Looking at Sun Changyou, the skilled stoker, he calmly supplies materials for the two hammers. Over there is Liu Shuhou, the great craftsman, who is "squatting" on the bench, trimming and repairing the finished products made by Liu Lifu and Liu Shujin. Liu Lifu and Liu Shujin's work is passed to Liu Shuhou. A complete set of work is completed.
    As the saying goes: "Strike while the iron is hot." If there is no division of labor, and everyone rushes around busily, it would be difficult to handle. In the past, the iron would cool down after the work was done, and the trimming and repairing had to be done in the furnace again. Now, Liu Lifu separates everyone and works in order, from the red-hot iron to the trimmed and repaired product, it only takes two heats, saving time, labor, and coal. It also changed the past chaotic and busy rush phenomenon.
    When the administrative side promoted this set of experience and methods to the entire factory, the production teams in the entire workshop increased their output. Even the Li Zhixi team, which usually completed fewer tasks, increased its output to 130 percent after accepting this experience.
    Saved Enormous Wealth for the Motherland
    In the patriotic production competition to resist America, aid Korea, protect the home, and defend the country, the new goal of the Liu Lifu team is "saving."
    Red and green slogans written by workers are posted everywhere on the factory walls: "Step up production, and also strive to save, save 3 percent from a ton of iron!"
    The Liu Lifu team had saved in the past, but they had not studied it carefully. Therefore, the saved iron was piled together. Because iron has twenty or so different hardnesses, they did not care about the hardness of the iron, and picked it up and forged it, so when the forged products were sent to the machine factory to be machined, they were found to be "too hard, cannot be machined."
    The entire Liu Lifu team implemented a new method, separating the hardness of the iron. When there was a shortage of material for forging that kind of iron, Sun Changyou, the stoker, would go to the pile of scrap iron of that type early to retrieve a piece to make up for it. As soon as Liu Shuhou finished forging a gear, Liu Likuan immediately took advantage of the heat to knock off the two-inch "stub" left over from the gear and throw it into the pile of that type of iron.
    Liu Lifu, Liu Shuhou, and Liu Shujin, the three sixth-grade locksmiths, are working hard to find ways to save scrap. In the past, when the three of them were measuring raw materials and calculating work, they would heat the iron and then measure and calculate. Because the heated iron was very hot, they could not use a ruler to measure it inch by inch, but only used calipers to compare. Now, they first measure the material, calculate it, and calculate how many are enough. If there are a few millimeters short at the end, they will find a way not to add material, and save half a millimeter or half a millimeter from the measured work and put them together. Sometimes, they try to underestimate the size left for machining. In this way, they are fighting for saving raw materials meticulously and carefully!
    Some time ago, the administrative side gave them another ton and a half of No. 3 iron and asked them to forge 150 saddle-shaped "flanges." They actually used all scrap iron to forge them, which saved a ton and a half of iron. If averaged, the Liu Lifu team saves more than 5 percent of raw materials for every ton of iron they work with. Comrade Liu Zhumao said: "It is impossible not to use your brain. In the past, no one knew that saving materials had so many advantages. For example, in the past, to make a two-and-a-half-inch screw, you had to put the whole material into the furnace to heat it, and it had to be cut off one by one, which wasted effort and tired people! Now, these odd jobs are often done with scrap materials, which saves time, labor, coal, and raw materials for the public. This is simply too good."
    Liu Lifu Team's Honor
    In the patriotic production competition, the Liu Lifu team is fighting in this way: using their brains, coming up with methods, increasing production, and saving raw materials and materials for the motherland.
    Now, the Liu Lifu team has been approved as a "Superior Product Quality Team." The team that wins this glorious title needs to complete 200 percent of the annual task for the whole year, and the quality must be 100 percent compliant with specifications. From January to the end of October, the Liu Lifu team averaged 243 percent of its planned output each month. In terms of quality, they have already been approved for inspection exemption. "Quality inspection exemption" means that because the work they do has reached the standard for a long time, the product inspectors are exempted from inspection procedures.
    The work of the Liu Lifu team also has the advantage of not suffering from hot and cold spells. Their work performance is very stable. They punched ten "flange" holes. The first five took six seconds each, and the last five took seven seconds, a difference of only one second. Now, the experience of the Liu Lifu team is being promoted in the Lushun-Dalian area.

　　刘立富模范生产小组
    刘冰晔
    编者按：刘立富小组是旅顺市的一个模范生产小组。这个小组荣获了“优等产品模范小组”的光荣称号。他们从一九五○年一月到十月底，每月平均完成计划的百分之二百四十三。在质量上，一直保持着百分之百合于规格，且已被批准免检。
    刘立富小组在战斗
    踏进厂门口，一块一丈来高的大铁板上写道：“向优等产品质量刘立富小组学习！”的大标语，像一个哨兵似地屹立着。再往里走，就能看到刘立富及全组组员们，汗流满面，在有力地打着刚烧好的通红通红的小“法兰盘”。
    气锤腰间贴着一张大红纸，写着醒目的大字：“为抗美援朝，把愤恨变成力量，加紧生产，壮大保卫祖国、保卫家乡的力量，因此向出席全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议的王兆达挑战，并向铁路工厂应战。”
    他们为实现自己的决心，提出“三下当做两下打”。看锤的老于提出：“我用三吨气锤撞死美帝！”在刘立富的车间里，首先给人的印象就是无比的劳动热情。锤声响亮，手不停，脚不住，由烧火到打锤，到修理，一连串的动作就像是一部很精密的机器，按着纯熟的节拍在开动。他们全组组员化成了一个整体。
    在生产竞赛中发挥每一个人的劳动热情热心工作是必要的。然而，人的力量是有限的，生产竞赛是长期的，不能十天半个月一顿突击，把人累的“吐血”，以后完蛋。刘立富小组却不是单纯提高劳动强度，而是出色地组织劳动。
    精密分工合作的劳动组织
    刘立富小组在工作时，是有一套熟练工作方法的。十一月份厂里的任务全是干小活。厂里有三个小电锤，一个大气锤，干小活用气锤太浪费了，三个小电锤又供不上各个生产小组的使用。刘立富小组就提出：“抗美援朝，克服困难，不用气锤，超过任务。”为实现这一口号，刘立富把本组七个人按照技术的能力，分成三个小组。各个组都保证做到“底打上慢，一块干”。刘立富领着刘立宽、于龙作干比较难打的六楞子螺丝帽。刘立富刚一打好，刘立宽递上盘圈子，再打三、五下，于龙作马上套上铁套（工具）子，给活投下去。这一套工作，看来真像传球似地快。刘述金带着于振发打螺丝，只看到他们两手动作，看不到他们脚动。再看孙长有烧火能手，他从容地供给两个锤打的材料。那边是刘述厚大工匠，他在“蹲”子上一边把尖一边修理刘立富、刘述金打好的成品。刘立富，刘述金活儿传到刘述厚手里。一套工作就完成了。
    俗语说：“乘热打铁。”如果没有分工，大家抢这样忙那样，可就不好办了。以前，活打完了铁也冷了，把尖，修理，再得回一次炉。现在刘立富把大家分开来，依着次序工作，从烧红的铁到把尖修理好，只是两炉火，省时间，省人力，又省煤。并且改变了过去乱抢乱忙的突击现象。
    当行政方面把这一套经验办法推广到全厂后，全车间的生产小组都提高了产量，连平常较少完成任务的李治喜小组，接受了这个经验以后，也把产量提高到百分之一百三十 。
    为祖国节约了巨大财富
    在抗美援朝保家卫国生产竞赛中，刘立富小组的新目标是“节约”。
    工厂的墙上到处都贴着工人亲手写的红绿标语：“加紧生产，同时也要努力节约，一吨铁省出百分之三来！”
    刘立富小组过去也节省过，可是，他们没有细细地研究。因而省下来的铁，都堆在一块。因为铁有二十来种不同的硬度，他们不管铁的软硬，拿起来就打，所以打出来的东西送到机械厂去车，就嫌“太硬，车不动。”
    刘立富全体组员实行了新的方法，把铁的硬度分别隔离开来，遇到打那号铁的活少料时，烧火的孙长有老早就到那号废铁堆里取出一块来补上。当刘述厚刚把牙轮打好，刘立宽马上趁着热把牙轮剩的二寸“纠”打掉，扔到那号铁堆里去。
    刘立富、刘述厚、刘述金三个把钳子的六级工匠，更是在为了节省废料努力想办法。过去他们三个人在量原料计算活时，都是烧好了铁再量再算的，因为烧好的铁很烤人，就不能用尺一分一寸来量，只是用卡钳比量。现在是先把料量好，算好，够几个，算到最后如果少几个米厘时，他们就想法不添料，从量好的活里头半个米厘、半个米厘地省出来向一块凑合。有时候就把留着车的尺码尽量少算，就这样精密细致地为节约原料而奋斗！
    前些时，行政方面又给了一吨半三号铁，叫他们打出一百五十个马鞍形的“法兰盘”。他们竟全用废铁打，这一下子就省了一吨半铁。如果平均起来，刘立富小组干一吨铁料，不止省百分之五。刘竹茂同志说：“不开动脑筋是不行的，过去，谁也不知道，节省料还有这样多的好处；比方过去要打二寸半的螺丝，得把整料放到炉里烧，烧好了得一个一个砍下来，费了工夫，人也受了累！现在往往像这些零碎活，用废料就干了，这样又省时间，又省人工、又省煤、又给公家省原料，这简直是太好了。”
    刘立富小组的荣誉
    在爱国主义的生产竞赛中，刘立富小组就是这样地在战斗着：开动脑筋，想出办法，提高了生产量，而且为祖国节省了原料和材料。
    现在，刘立富小组已经被批准为“优等产品质量小组”了。荣获这光荣称号的小组需要一年完成全年任务的百分之二百，质量要百分之百合规格的。刘立富小组自一月到十月底，每月平均完成计划产量的百分之二百四十三，在质量上，已经是批准免检了。”质量免检，就是说，他们干的活由于长期地达到标准，产品检查人员免除了检查手续。
    刘立富小组的工作更具有不犯冷热病的优点。他们工作成绩很稳固，他们打了十个“法兰盘”的眼，头五个每个用六秒，后五个用上七秒，相差仅一秒钟。现在，刘立富小组的经验，已经在旅大地区推广着。
