    Some Village Governments in the Fengnan Mining Area of Hebei Province
    Force Workers to Study and Drill
    Disregarding Workers' Work and Rest Time
    To the Editor:
    It is the workers' demand to strive to improve their political and cultural level and to develop a strong physique. However, some village governments use coercive methods to force workers to participate in study or drilling, regardless of the working conditions and health of the miners. We believe this is wrong. According to the workers, this is the case in Dama Village, Eighth District, Fengnan County.
    The village government of Dama Village, Eighth District, Fengnan County, organizes young people aged 18 to 35 for drilling, and those aged 35 to 50 for political and cultural studies. They stipulate that everyone must participate, regardless of the workers' working hours. Some workers who work day shifts and 6 a.m. shifts sometimes have meetings in the factory after work, and when they return late, they cannot catch up with study or drilling. The village government would call them to the village office at 12 o'clock at night in the name of checking household registrations, give them a big lecture, ask them why they didn't come, and put a series of labels on the workers. Furthermore, some workers on the 2 a.m. shift go down the shaft at 11 p.m., and by the time they have taken a bath and walked home, it is already 1:30 a.m. After eating, they don't get to sleep until 2 a.m. The village government stipulates that they must drill at 5:30 a.m. the next morning, so they only get three and a half hours of sleep. This not only affects the workers' health, but is also detrimental to production. Some workers hold important positions underground, and lack of sleep can easily lead to accidents.
    We believe that the practice of the Dama Village government in Fengnan County is wrong. We hope that the Fengnan County People's Government will quickly correct it.

### 河北丰南矿区有的村政府  强迫工人学习出操  不顾工人工作、休息时间

    河北丰南矿区有的村政府
    强迫工人学习出操
    不顾工人工作、休息时间编辑同志：
    努力提高自己的政治、文化水平，锻炼健壮的体格，这本是工人的要求；但是，有的村政府用强迫命令方式，不顾矿区工人工作情况与身体健康，强制工人参加学习或出操，我们认为这是不对的。根据工友反映，丰南县八区大马各庄即有此种情况。
    丰南县第八区大马各庄村政府组织十八岁至三十五岁的壮青年出操，三十五岁至五十岁学习政治文化。他们规定每个人都得参加，毫不照顾工人的工作时间。有些做日班和六点班工友，下班后有时在厂内开会，回去晚了，赶不上学习或出操。村政府就在夜间十二点用查户口的方式，把他们叫到村公所大训一顿，问他们为啥不到，还把一连串的帽子扣到工友们的头上。再有做两点班的工友，夜间十一点上罐，洗洗澡，走到家就得一点半，再吃完饭后，睡觉就得二点。村政府规定第二天早晨五点半出操，他们就只能睡三个半钟头。这样，不但影响了工友们的健康，对生产也是不利的。有的工友在井下担任重要职务，因睡眠不足，很易发生事故。
    我们认为：丰南县大马各庄村政府这样做法是不对的。希望丰南县人民政府迅速予以纠正。
