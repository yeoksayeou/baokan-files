　　Develop Domestic Agricultural Medicines
    Xi Fengzhou
    In the agricultural production movement, the broad masses of farmers have voiced a common demand: an urgent need to improve the technology of preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests through scientific methods. To meet this demand from the masses, more than thirty types of chemical pesticides were promoted nationwide last year, totaling over 1,383 tons, plus locally produced agents, amounting to more than 3,000 tons. This is unprecedented in terms of the quantity, impact, variety, and regional coverage of pesticide promotion. For example, in Chahar, Shanxi, Shandong, and other provinces and regions, farmers who correctly disinfected seeds experienced reduced or no disease occurrence. In the cotton-growing areas of Handan, Hebei Province, hundreds of thousands of catties of domestically produced pesticides were prepared last year to help the masses prevent and control diseases and insect pests on more than two million mu. In the suburbs of Beijing, pesticides were used to control vegetable pests on tens of thousands of mu, with significant results. Especially in areas where pesticide use is customary, farmers demand pesticides even more urgently. However, due to the vastness of China's agricultural areas, the supply of pesticides cannot fully meet actual needs for the time being. For example, last year, cotton aphids and red spiders were widespread in North China, and the masses demanded pesticide control. However, because red spiders developed rapidly and pesticides were not adequately prepared in advance, millions of mu of cotton fields suffered varying degrees of damage. Another example is wheat smut, a relatively common and serious disease in China's wheat-producing areas, causing yield reductions of about 5% in mild cases and over 30% in severe cases. Therefore, how to supply large quantities of pesticides to farmers continuously in the future is a problem that must be solved.
    Under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, China's supply of agricultural medicines was mainly imported from Japan and the United States. Many of the pesticides used last year were also British and American products such as "666," "DDT," and "Ceresan." Currently, American imperialism is trying to exacerbate the difficulties in China's pesticide sector through blockades. Therefore, in order to launch a counter-blockade struggle against American imperialism and ensure the success of this year's great production movement, we must step up the development of domestic pesticides.
    China's domestic pesticide manufacturing has not yet had a normal opportunity to develop. The main reason is that under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionary government, the original domestic pesticide manufacturing industry was either destroyed or stagnated. The most obvious example is the Hunan arsenic mine, which suffered severe damage from the Kuomintang reactionary government and the enemy puppets, resulting in a sharp decline in production. It was not until after liberation, with the advocacy and support of the People's Government, that it began to improve.
    In fact, the reserves and potential for increased production of pesticide raw materials in various parts of China are very large. For example, if the Hunan arsenic mine can be mined using machinery, in addition to supplying the entire country with insecticides annually, it can also refine large quantities of insecticides and fungicides such as "lead arsenate," "calcium arsenate," and "arsenic trioxide."
    "Sodium fluorosilicate" was previously used to control locusts. After promotion in Hebei Province and other regions, it has proven to be a very effective agent for controlling underground pests (such as mole crickets), but in the past, it was mostly imported from foreign countries, which limited its promotion. Last year, Zhejiang Province successfully trial-produced it, and experiments and research should continue to be carried out to obtain more certainty before further mass manufacturing and promotion to various regions. The "copper sulfate" manufactured by the pesticide factories in the Northeast and Shanxi Provinces is also a very important seed disinfectant and should be manufactured and developed in a planned way. Regarding "666," "Ceresan," and other pesticides, people are already conducting research and experimentation.
    For general insecticidal plants, in the future, we should: on the one hand, carry out planned propagation, and on the other hand, carry out processing and manufacturing. For example, the output of "rotenone" in southern China is not yet sufficient and should be massively propagated. "Thunder God Vine" grows wild in large quantities, and local farmers widely use it. Cultivation and manufacturing should be studied to increase production. "Pyrethrum" is a very important insecticidal plant, but it is rarely cultivated in China. It should be massively propagated through farms in North China and other regions, and then further promoted to farmers.
    In order to fully utilize the insecticidal effect of applying pesticides, it is even more important not to neglect the various effective locally produced agents that have been promoted and implemented among the masses in various places, such as "tobacco water," "lime-sulfur mixture," "cottonseed oil soap," "bitter bark," and other agents that can control insects. These locally produced agents should be utilized and developed as much as possible. For example, Henan promoted 100,000 catties of "cottonseed oil soap" last year, Hebei Province produced a large amount of "lime-sulfur mixture," and Wuxiang area in Shanxi Province organized the masses to dig more than 100,000 catties of various local medicines. In general cotton-growing areas, "tobacco water" has been widely used to control aphids. At present, adopting this method to solve the shortage of pesticides is necessary, and it should be highly valued in the development of domestic pesticides.
    Vigorously developing domestic pesticides is still an emerging industry in China's economic construction. In order to carry out production in a planned way, China's existing public and private pesticide manufacturers should be organized to continue to improve technology and manufacture low-cost, highly effective pesticides and insecticides based on the current urgent needs of the masses, preparing for further promotion to various regions.
    The pesticides sold in various places must be rigorously inspected and strictly managed by government inspection agencies. Last year, many substandard pesticides appeared on the market, and farmers suffered losses after using them because they could not kill pests. This should attract the attention of local government agencies.

　　发展国产农用药物
    席凤洲
    在农业生产运动中，广大农民发出了一个共同的呼声：迫切要求以科学的方法，提高防治病虫害的技术。为适应群众这个要求，去年全国曾推广化学农药三十余种，总数在一千三百八十三吨以上，另加各地所推广的土产药剂，合起来共有三千多吨。这无论在农药推广的数量上、作用上、种类上，以及地区上，都是空前的。例如在察哈尔、山西、山东等省及其他地区，凡是以正确的方法进行过种子消毒的农户，病害都减轻或完全未发生了。在河北省邯郸植棉区，去年准备了数十万斤的国产药剂，帮助群众防治病虫害二百多万亩。北京郊区一带，使用农药防治了蔬菜害虫数万亩，收到了显著的效果。特别是在使用农药有习惯的地区，农民要求农药也更加迫切。可是，由于我国农业地区的辽阔，农药的供应，一时还不能完全满足实际的需要。例如去年华北地区，普遍发生棉蚜与红蜘蛛为害，群众纷纷要求药剂防治。但因红蜘蛛发展甚快，药剂事前没有充分准备，遂使数百万亩棉田，遭受轻重不同的灾害。又如麦类黑穗病，在中国产麦地区，是一种比较普遍而且严重的病害，轻的减产百分之五左右，重的减产百分之三十以上。因此，今后如何以大批农药源源供应农民，是必须设法解决的问题。
    我国农用药剂的供应，过去在国民党反动派的统治下，主要是由日本和美国输进，去年所用农药中亦有不少“六六六”、“滴滴涕”、“赛力散”等英美货。目前美帝妄想以封锁来加重我国农药方面的困难。因此，为了展开对美帝的反封锁斗争，和保证今年大生产运动的成功，我们必须加紧发展国产农药。
    我国国产农药的制造，一直还没有得到正常发展的机会。主要原因是过去在国民党反动政府的统治下，国内原有的农药制造工业，有的已被摧毁，有的陷于停顿。最明显的如湖南砒素矿，经过国民党反动政府和敌伪的严重破坏，生产锐减。直到解放后，经过人民政府的提倡与扶植，才开始好转。
    事实上，我国各地农药原料的蕴藏量与可能增产量都是很大的，如湖南的砒矿若能改用机器开采，每年除供给全国杀虫外，并可精制大量“砒酸铅”、“砒酸钙”、“亚砒酸”等杀虫杀菌药剂。
    “氟矽酸钠”，过去曾作治蝗用，后经河北省各地和其他地区推广结果，对于防治地下虫害（如蝼蛄），是一种很有效的药剂，但过去多从外国输入，使推广受到限制。去年浙江省已试制成功，应该继续进行试验研究，求得更有把握后，再进一步大量制造，向各地推广。还有东北区和山西省农药厂制造的“王铜”，也是很重要的种子消毒药剂，应该有计划地制造与发展。关于“六六六”、“赛力散”以及其他农药，已有人在进行研究试验的工作。
    对于一般杀虫植物，今后应该是：一面有计划地进行繁殖，一面进行加工制造。如我国南部的“鱼藤”产量还不够多，应大量繁殖。“雷公藤”野生甚多，当地农民普遍使用，应研究栽培和制造，以增加产量。“除虫菊”是很重要的杀虫植物，在中国栽培较少，应该在华北各地及其他地区，通过农场大量繁殖，然后进一步再向农民推广。
    为了充分发挥应用农药的治虫作用，更重要的，是不能忽略各地群众中，已经推广行之有效的各种土产药剂，如“烟草水”、“石灰硫磺合剂”、“棉油皂”、“苦树皮”以及其他可以治虫的药剂。这些土产药剂，都应该加以利用，并尽量去发展。如去年河南曾推广“棉油皂”十万斤，河北省曾制出大量的“石灰硫磺合剂”，山西省武乡地区曾组织群众刨各种土药十万多斤。一般植棉地区，曾普遍使用了“烟草水”治蚜虫。在目前采用这种方法解决农药的缺乏，都是必要的，而且，在发展国产农药的途径上，应十分重视起来。
    大力发展国产农药，在中国来说，目前还是经济建设中一种新兴事业，为了有计划地进行生产，中国现有的公、私农药制造厂，应该组织起来，继续提高技术，并根据群众当前的迫切需要，制造出成本低、药效高的病虫农药，准备进一步向各地推广。
    各地出卖的农药，政府必须有检验机构，认真鉴定和严格管理。去年市上出现许多不合规格的农药，农民使用以后，并不能毒杀害虫，反而遭到了损失，应引起各地政府机关的注意。
