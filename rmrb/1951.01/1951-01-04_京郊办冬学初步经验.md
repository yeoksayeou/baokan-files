Preliminary Experiences in Running Winter Schools in the Suburbs of Beijing
    Tu Guang
    By the end of last November, 277 winter schools with 591 classes had been established in the suburbs of Beijing. 17,926 farmers enrolled, more than double the number in November of the previous year. Each administrative village now has a winter school.
    The reasons for the success of the winter schools last year are mainly due to the importance attached to them by general district leaders, the training of a large number of mass teachers, and in-depth mobilization based on the living conditions of the masses. Facts have proved that winter schools are well-run when the leadership attaches importance to them, and vice versa. The Thirteenth District is the district with the largest agricultural population in the suburbs, but because the leadership did not pay enough attention to running winter schools, only one sentence was said during the transmission of suburban work at the Agricultural Congress: "There is a separate plan for winter school work." This did not arouse widespread attention among cadres, so only 37 schools with 83 classes and 2,296 people have been established so far. More than one-third of the students are children, which is far from the plan to enroll 5,000 people. The Fifteenth District, on the other hand, has only one-quarter of the total population of the Thirteenth District, but because the leadership conveyed and discussed the work of winter schools at the District People's Congress, stipulating that district cadres should report on winter schools when reporting on their work in the countryside, the development has been faster. Currently, there are 38 schools with 51 classes and 1,864 people, with winter schools in every natural village on average, and many with two classes. For example, the village chief of Qi Shengmiao Village refused to be the director of the winter school committee, so the winter school could not be established; however, in Da Huangzhuang, the model village for autumn grain collection in the Tenth District, cadres took the lead in attending winter school, carried out in-depth mobilization in various ways, and established three winter schools with 82 participants, in accordance with the dispersed situation of natural villages. There are also year-round civil schools.
    Paying attention to the training of mass teachers is an indispensable condition for running winter schools well. After studying, the 533 mass teachers in the suburbs of Beijing generally realized the importance of farmers' education and were very enthusiastic. They all made plans to run winter schools, and under the principle of "mobilizing village cadres, youth, and activists to attend winter schools on a voluntary basis, with cultural learning as the main focus," they used various methods to carry out in-depth mobilization and publicity. For example, Wang Shunfeng, the cultural and educational committee member of Wangshan Mutian, told the masses about his past suffering from illiteracy and the convenience after becoming literate. After returning from their studies, the mass teachers in Bali Zhuang first mobilized their own families to influence others. In this way, mass teachers have become the backbone in carrying out the work of winter schools.
    Mobilization work should be carried out according to the living conditions of the masses, the specific requirements and concerns for learning, and put forward specific methods for winter schools. Mobilization work cannot be limited to general appeals and mobilization at meetings, or limited to understanding the opinions of individual activists on learning. The following mobilization methods are used in the suburbs of Beijing:
    1. Use small-scale cultural grievance methods to inspire farmers' learning requirements. Li Hanqing of Da Huangzhuang used a check for five hundred silver dollars from his landlord as toilet paper before liberation and was fired. Meng Datou of Machang mistakenly used a fake Central ticket to buy tofu, and the tofu seller used it to buy beans, which was only discovered after the two quarreled. In the past, some illiterate farmers in the eastern suburbs had difficulty finding work in the city. Some old ladies were afraid of hindering their daughters' learning because of sewing soles (a sideline for women in the eastern suburbs), but when they talked about the disadvantages of illiteracy, they did not stop them from going to school.
    2. Deeply understand the masses' reactions to winter schools and eliminate ideological concerns. When the Cultural and Educational Section of the Tenth District conducted a pilot project for winter schools in Gao Beidian, it mobilized students from the village's primary school, cultural center, and work-study group to understand the opinions of village cadres and the masses on winter schools. It was discovered that the masses were not satisfied with the previous winter schools, so their confidence was not high. Some said: "Adults and children are mixed together, it's noisy like a toad pit." "The teacher is this one today, that one tomorrow, it's not connected; neither the teacher nor the student knows each other's temperament, what can they learn?" "Sometimes they even ask children to teach, they are the ones we raised, but they are teaching us now." Based on the above reactions, a cadre meeting and a League member meeting were convened. District cadres reviewed that the leadership did not pay close attention last year, and expressed their determination to run it well this winter, step up learning, and lead everyone. Graduates from the winter school teacher training class were invited to be teachers; and it was explained to the masses that young teachers could still help everyone, and everyone formulated rules, so 101 young farmers attended winter school.
    3. Let the civil school students who study well make reports to establish the masses' confidence in learning. The winter school in Gaojing Village was transformed into a civil school last year and persisted for a year. Many young people have read the civil school textbooks to the third and fourth volumes, and arithmetic has been learned to decimals and fractions. The young people in the nearby villages are very envious and regret that they did not persist last year. Some older people also eliminated the idea that "they have passed the age of eating literacy." They calculated that if they recognized three characters a day, they would be three or four hundred in one winter, and it would be done in a few winters.
    4. With learning confidence and requirements, it is also necessary to solve learning difficulties. Dispersed villages dislike the time it takes to travel, so they are established separately; women with children need to take care of their families, so they mobilize primary school students or other neighbors to teach; if there is not enough money for lamp oil, the Tenth District buys it from the cooperative and distributes oil according to the actual lighting time. Many villages draw money from sideline production profits to buy oil.

　　京郊办冬学初步经验
    土光
    京郊冬学，截至去年十一月底止，已开办二百七十七处，五百九十一班，有一万七千九百二十六农民上了学，超过前年十一月份的一倍，已经作到每个行政村有一处冬学。
    去年冬学获得如此成绩的原因，主要是由于一般区领导的重视，培养了大批群众教师与根据群众生活情况进行了深入的动员。事实证明：领导上重视冬学就办得好，反之则差。十三区是郊区农业人口最多的区，但因领导上对办冬学不够重视，在农代会传达郊区工作时，只说一句“冬学工作另有计划”，没有引起干部的普遍注意，因之目前只开办三十七处，八十三班，二千二百九十六人。学员三分之一以上是儿童，距离争取五千人入学的计划还很远。而十五区，总人口只有十三区的四分之一，但因领导上在区各界人民代表会议上传达并讨论了冬学工作，规定区干部下乡工作汇报时，要汇报冬学，因而发展较快，目前已有三十八处，五十一班，一千八百六十四人，平均每个自然村都有冬学，而且不少是两班。又如七圣庙村村长，拒绝当冬学委员会主任，因而冬学办不起来；但在十区秋征模范村大黄庄，由于干部带头上冬学，用各种方式深入动员，适应着自然村分散情况办了三处冬学，八十二人参加学习，另外还有常年民校。
    注意培养群众教师是办好冬学不可缺少的条件。京郊五百三十三名群众教师经过学习后，一般都认识到农民教育的重要性，热情很高，纷纷订了办冬学的计划，在“在自愿原则下，动员村干部、青年、积极分子上冬学，并以文化学习为主”的方针下，利用各种方式深入动员宣传。如王杉木店文教委员王顺风向群众诉说过去自己不识字的痛苦，识字后的方便。八里庄群众教师学习回去后，先把自己一家动员起来影响别人。这样，群众教师便成了开展冬学工作中的骨干。
    动员工作要根据群众生活情况，对学习的具体要求与顾虑等条件来进行，提出冬学的具体办法。而不能把动员工作只停留在大会动员和一般号召上，或只限于了解个别积极分子对学习的意见。京郊采用的动员方式有以下几种：
    一、用小型文化诉苦的方式，启发农民的学习要求。大黄庄李汉卿，解放前把东家五百银元的支票，当便纸用掉，被解雇了。马厂孟大头误拿伪中央票买豆腐，卖豆腐的又拿他买豆子才被发现，以致二人争吵起来。东郊过去有些不认字的农民到城内找工作很困难。有的老大娘怕妨碍衲底子（东郊妇女副业）不让女儿上冬学，但谈到不识字的坏处，便不阻拦她们上学了。
    二、深入了解群众对冬学的反映，消除思想顾虑。十区文教科在高碑店搞冬学试点时，动员该村小学、文化馆和工学团的学生，了解村干部与群众对冬学的意见。发觉群众对过去的冬学不满意，因之信心不高。有的说：“大人小孩混在一处，乱烘烘像个蛤蟆坑。”“教员今天是这一个，明天是那个，接不上岔；先生学生谁都摸不清谁的脾气，学个啥呢？”“有时还叫小孩子来教，他们是咱们抱大的，倒教起咱们来了。”根据以上的反映，便召开了干部会、团员会，区干部检讨了前年领导抓的不紧，表示今冬下决心办好，加紧学习，带动大家，请在冬学教师训练班毕业的当先生；并向群众解释，小先生还是可以帮助大家，又由大家订出规矩，于是有一百零一个青年农民上了冬学。
    三、让学习好的民校学生做报告，树立群众的学习信心。高井村去年冬学转成民校，坚持了一年，好多青年，将民校课本念到三册四册，算术学到小数点及分数，附近村的青年都很羡慕，后悔去年没坚持下来。有些岁数大的，也消除了“过了吃文墨岁数啦”的思想。他们计算，一天认三个字，一冬就是三四百，几个冬天就行了。
    四、有了学习信心与要求，还要解决学习困难。分散的村，嫌跑路费时间，便分散成立；有小孩的妇女，要看家，便动员小学生或其他邻居来教；灯油钱不够，十区便从合作社买来，按实际点灯的时间发油，不少村从副业生产盈利中抽钱买油。
