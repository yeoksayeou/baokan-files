　　Summary of the Political Report of the Sixth Plenary Session of the China Democratic League

　　【Xinhua News Agency, 5th】 The following is a summary of the political report passed by the Sixth Plenary Session of the China Democratic League on December 10, 1950:

　　1950 was an important year in Chinese and world history. In this year, the balance of power between the two opposing camps in the world underwent a significant change. The peace and democracy camp, led by the Soviet Union, achieved unprecedented unity, growth, and progress in this year. The imperialist aggression camp, led by the United States, was more isolated and weakened than it was a year ago. However, on the other hand, due to the US imperialism's frantic aggression against Taiwan and Korea, and its active preparations to expand the war, the flames of aggressive war have already spread to the edge of the Asian continent and to China's doorstep.

　　In such a tense situation, peace-loving people all over the world are fighting to defend peace and stop aggression. The victorious Chinese people naturally cannot ignore the blatant actions of US imperialism's armed aggression against Taiwan and Korea. The Chinese people's volunteer movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend our country has been universally and enthusiastically launched. Our people's volunteer forces are already fighting shoulder to shoulder with the Korean People's Army on the south bank of the Yalu River, blocking the barbarous invading army of US imperialism and achieving initial glorious victories. US imperialism and its lackeys are beginning to tremble in the face of the powerful anti-aggression forces of the Chinese and Korean people.

　　We must consolidate and develop the victories we have already achieved in the past year, and we must strive for greater and more glorious new victories in the sacred movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend our country. This is the current goal of our national people's efforts.

　　The victories and successes achieved by the People's Republic of China in the first year of its founding are unparalleled in any period of Chinese history. In just one year, we have completed the true unification of all of China - the complete unification in political, military, financial, and economic aspects, from the central government to the local governments, and from the cities to the countryside. All fraternal nationalities within China, regardless of blood or religious belief, have begun to unite and cooperate in a friendly and good national family. All the Chinese people, regardless of gender, age, party affiliation, or class, have fully demonstrated a high degree of patriotism, loving their leaders and supporting the People's Government. This is an unprecedented grand occasion in China's five thousand years of history! In this year, a new type of true democratic system was successfully implemented for the first time in a large country in the world, that is, the people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance. In this year, we implemented the great charter of the Chinese people - the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. This Common Program not only proves to be fully in line with the current demands of the Chinese people, but also proves that every word and every sentence can be 100% fulfilled.

　　All these brilliant victories and astonishing achievements show that the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party is wise and correct; and that the great unity of the various democratic classes and nationalities of China, and the resulting strength of the people's democratic united front, are incomparably powerful.

　　US imperialists have been scheming to invade China, and the historical facts of the past hundred years have already made this clear. If anyone isolates the US war of aggression against Korea, thinking that the enemy's troops have not yet entered the country and that China can "close its doors to the world," this is completely wrong. Facts have proven that US imperialism has a whole plan to invade China, and armed aggression against Korea is only the first step in the plan, and the second step will be armed aggression against the Northeast.

　　If anyone thinks that China's economic construction is more urgent than resisting US aggression and aiding Korea today, this is also wrong. Imperialists will not allow the people to engage in economic construction in peace and security. Resisting aggression and stopping war is precisely to remove obstacles to economic construction. It is a thought of complacency and escapism to talk emptily about peaceful construction under the threat of the aggressor's planes and artillery.

　　Naturally, there are still a very few people who believe that the United States is the richest and most powerful country in the world, that the United States has great productivity and new weapons, and that it is an irresistible force, and even that resisting US aggression and aiding Korea has the danger of "playing with fire and getting burned." It must be known that imperialism is originally dying capitalism. US imperialism has become an arrow at the end of its flight today. Although its productivity is great, due to unplanned and blind production, it cannot overcome the economic crisis. In order to expand its market and solve the problem of domestic overproduction, the United States is intensifying its plunder and exploitation of the people in colonial and semi-colonial countries. In addition, contradictions also arise between the United States and British and French imperialism and other vassal states. Precisely because of this, US imperialists vainly attempt to use war to overcome contradictions, but the result of war will definitely strengthen and expand their contradictions. Imperialists want to develop in war, but they will surely be destroyed in war. As for the absurd view of the weapon-only theory, it is not worth refuting. Atomic bombs cannot determine the outcome of war.

　　Today, China has a strong and unified government, a sincerely united people, and a heroic and well-trained military force. Our people's military force has defeated militarist Japan and eliminated the eight million Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops equipped by the United States. And in the struggle against aggression and in defense of peace, the Chinese people are absolutely not isolated. The strength of the world's peace and democracy camp is great. The people of China and Korea, as well as the people of the world, have the strength, courage, and confidence to defeat them.

　　Using voluntary action to resist US aggression and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend our country is the urgent task of the Chinese people today, and it is also the general political task of the China Democratic League today. In order to shoulder this major and glorious political task, we are willing to mobilize all members of the League and call on the people of the whole country to carry out the following tasks:

　　First, to fight to consolidate national defense and resist aggression. First of all, we should use manpower and material resources to support the Korean People's Army and the volunteer forces to aid Korea, and the rear should serve the front. At the same time, we must strengthen the defense of the land, sea, and air, actively prepare to liberate Taiwan, and prepare to give a head-on blow to any foreign aggressor.

　　Second, to fight to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship. We must consolidate and develop our already gained victories, strengthen and expand the people's democratic united front, unite the people of all classes and nationalities in the country, support the People's Government, support the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party, severely suppress counter-revolutionaries, eliminate bandits and spies, and consolidate revolutionary order.

　　Third, to fight to consolidate finance and economy. We must strictly practice streamlining and thrift, stabilize currency and prices, balance financial revenue and expenditure, strengthen production and construction in combat; and in the newly liberated areas, we must complete land reform in accordance with the established steps to eliminate feudal forces and improve people's lives.

　　Fourth, to fight to consolidate the cultural and ideological front. We must continue to carry out ideological remolding of the vast number of intellectuals, widely carry out patriotic and internationalist propaganda and education, eliminate pro-American, worship-American, and fear-American psychology, enhance national self-confidence, and eliminate slave-comprador feudal ideas.

　　民主同盟六中全会政治报告摘要
    【新华社五日讯】中国民主同盟于一九五○年十二月十日通过的六中全会政治报告摘要：
    一九五○年在中国和世界历史中都是重要的一年。这一年中，国际对立的两大阵营的力量对比起了重要的变化。以苏联为首的和平民主阵营，在这一年中达到了空前未有的团结、壮大和进步。以美国为首的帝国主义侵略阵营，比之于一年前，是更加孤立，更加削弱了。但是另一方面，由于美帝国主义疯狂地侵略台湾、朝鲜和积极地准备扩大战争，侵略战争的火焰已经燃烧到亚洲大陆的边沿和中国的大门口。
    在这样的紧张的局势中，全世界爱好和平的人民都在为保卫和平制止侵略而进行斗争。胜利的中国人民，对于美帝国主义武装侵略台湾朝鲜的蛮横行动自然更不能置之不理。中国人民志愿抗美援朝保家卫国的运动已经普遍地热烈地展开了。我们的人民的志愿部队已经在鸭绿江南岸和朝鲜人民军并肩作战，阻击美帝国主义的野蛮侵略军队而得到初步的辉煌的胜利了，美帝国主义和它的仆从们，面对着中朝人民的强大的反侵略力量，已经在开始发抖了。
    我们要巩固并且发展一年以来所已获得的胜利，我们更要在抗美援朝保家卫国的神圣运动中，争取更伟大更光辉的新胜利。这就是目前我们全国人民努力的目标。
    中华人民共和国在建国的第一年中，所获得的胜利和成功，是中国历史上任何时期所不能比拟的。在仅仅一年中，我们完成了全中国的真正统一——在政治、军事、财政、经济各方面，从中央到地方，从城市到乡村的完全统一。中国境内所有兄弟民族，不分血统和宗教信仰，在友爱和好的民族大家庭中，开始团结合作。全中国人民，不分男女老幼，不分党派阶级，充分发挥了高度的爱国精神，爱护领袖，拥戴人民政府。这是中国五千年历史中所未有的盛况！在这一年中，在世界上一个大国内首次成功地实行了一种新型的真正的民主制度，这就是以工人阶级为领导，以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政。在这一年中，我们实施了中国人民大宪章——人民政协共同纲领。这个共同纲领，不但证明完全符合目前中国人民的要求，而且证明了每一句每一字都可以百分之百地兑现。
    这一切辉煌的胜利和惊人的成就，说明了毛泽东主席和中国共产党的领导是英明正确的；说明了中国各民主阶级各民族人民的大团结及其由此形成的人民民主统一战线的力量是无比强大的。
    美帝国主义者处心积虑要侵略中国，一百年来历史事实早已做了明确的说明。倘有人把美国侵朝战争孤立起来看，以为敌兵尚未入境，中国可以“闭关自守”，这是完全错误的。事实证明，美帝国主义侵略中国是有整个计划的，武装侵朝只是计划中的第一步，第二步将是武装侵略东北。
    倘有人以为今天中国经济建设急于抗美援朝，这也是错误的。帝国主义者是不让人民在和平与安全中从事经济建设的。反抗侵略，制止战争，正是为着扫除经济建设的障碍。要是在侵略者飞机大炮的威胁下，空谈和平建设，这是一种偷安苟活的想法。
    自然，还会有极少数人相信美国是世界上最富强的国家，美国的生产力大，有新式武器，是不可抗拒的力量，甚至认为抗美援朝有“引火焚身自遭其祸”的危险。要知道帝国主义本来就是垂死的资本主义。美帝国主义在今天已成为强弩之末。它的生产力虽大，但由于无计划的盲目的生产，使它无法克服经济危机。为了扩展市场，解决国内的生产过剩问题，美国对殖民地半殖民地人民加紧掠夺榨取。此外，美国和英法帝国主义以及其他仆从国家之间也产生矛盾。唯其如此，美帝国主义者才妄想用战争以克服矛盾，但战争的结果必定加强和扩大他们的矛盾。帝国主义者们要在战争中图谋发展，他们必定在战争中得到毁灭。至于唯武器论的荒谬见解更不值一驳，原子弹不能决定战争的胜负。
    今天中国有坚强统一的政府，有精诚团结的人民，有英勇善战久经锻炼的武力。我们的人民武力曾经击败了军国主义的日本，曾经消灭了美国装备的八百万蒋匪队伍。并且在反抗侵略保卫和平的奋斗中，中国人民绝对不是孤立的。世界和平民主阵营的力量是伟大的。中朝两国人民，以及全世界人民，有力量、有勇气、有信心，必定能够击败他们。
    用志愿的行动抗美援朝保家卫国，是目前中国人民的紧急任务，也是中国民主同盟目前的总的政治任务。为了担负起这个重大的光荣的政治任务，我们愿意动员全体盟员，号召全国人民来进行以下的几项工作：
    第一、为巩固国防抵抗侵略而斗争。首先我们应当用人力物力，支援朝鲜人民军和援朝志愿部队，后方为前方服务。同时我们要加强陆上海上和天空的防卫，积极准备解放台湾，准备对任何外来侵略者予以迎头痛击。
    第二、为巩固人民民主专政而斗争。我们要巩固和发展我们已得的胜利，加强和扩大人民民主统一战线，团结全国各阶级各民族的人民，拥护人民政府，拥护毛泽东主席和中国共产党的领导，严厉镇压反革命，肃清匪特奸谍，巩固革命秩序。
    第三、为巩固财政经济而斗争。我们要厉行精简节约，稳定货币和物价，平衡财政收支，在战斗中加强生产建设；在新解放区要按照预定步骤完成土地改革，以肃清封建势力，改善人民生活。
    第四、为巩固文化思想战线而斗争。我们要继续进行广大知识分子的思想改造，要广泛展开爱国主义与国际主义的宣传教育，祛除亲美、崇美、恐美心理，提高民族自信，肃清奴隶买办封建思想。
