Reader's Letter

To the Editor:

I am from the countryside and came to work as an apprentice at the Fukang Tailor Shop, No. 11 West Chang'an Street, Beijing, before liberation. In the old society of exploitation and oppression, we apprentices suffered greatly. I really couldn't say anything back then. Now, I am very happy to hear workers' programs on the radio every day, knowing that the workers have turned over to become masters. Patriotic production competitions are being launched everywhere to build our new country. However, I have been an apprentice for four years this year. In these four years, the shop owner has not given me any money for the New Year or other holidays, nor has he given me money for bathing, nor even a pair of socks, and he doesn't allow me to join the union. This month, a comrade from the tax bureau came to investigate the tax situation. He asked us how much we spent each month. The shop owner said: We give them 130 catties of millet per month, and bathing fees are given separately each month. But after the tax bureau comrade left, the shop owner still didn't give us the money. To tell you the truth, I haven't taken a bath in three years. Now I have something to say. I request the editor to help me solve this problem.

Meng Qinghai

Editor's Note: The demands of Meng Qinghai, an apprentice at the Fukang Tailor Shop, are completely reasonable and legal. Workers have the right to join the union. The shop owner's refusal to allow apprentices to join the union is a violation of workers' rights and is illegal. Meng Qinghai has been an apprentice for four years. If he already possesses the qualifications of a formal worker, it is unreasonable for him to still be an apprentice. Even for an apprentice, the shop should provide appropriate care for their living. As Meng Qinghai said, it is reasonable to give apprentices some pocket money for the New Year and bathing.

### 北京西长安街福康西服店一个学徒的申诉

　　北京西长安街福康西服店一个学徒的申诉编辑同志：
    我是乡间人，在解放前来到城内西长安街十一号福康西服店当学徒。以前在剥削、压迫人的社会里，我们当学徒的受了很大的苦。那时我实在是无法说了。现在我每天从收音机中听到广播工人节目时，实在高兴，知道工人已经翻身做主人。各处展开爱国主义生产竞赛，建设我们新的国家。可是我到今年已经当了四年学徒，我在四年之内连年节掌柜的都不给我点钱，洗澡费也不给，袜子也不给一双穿，不让我参加工会。在本月有一税务局同志来查税务情形。他问我们每月开支多少钱。掌柜的说：每月给我们一百三十斤小米，每月洗澡费另给。可是税局的同志走后，掌柜还是不给我们钱。不瞒你说，我已经三年没洗过澡。现在我有话可要说出来了。要求编辑同志帮助我，解决这个问题。
            孟庆海
    编者按：福康西服店学徒孟庆海的要求完全是合理合法的。工人有参加工会的权利。该店资方不允许学徒参加工会，是侵犯工人权利的行为，是违法的。孟庆海当了四年学徒了，如果他已经具备了正式工人的条件，现在还当学徒，是不合理的。就是学徒，该店对其生活也应加以适当照顾，像孟庆海所说的过年、洗澡给学徒一些零用钱，也是合理的。
