Striving for the Cultural Liberation of Workers and Peasants
    ——A Record of Learning at Beijing Experimental Workers' and Peasants' Accelerated Secondary School
    Yan Meng
    All the students at Beijing Experimental Workers' and Peasants' Secondary School come from various military units, factories, and rural areas. They have rich experience in struggle, have performed meritorious service in battle and work, and have received awards. What difficulties do they encounter in their studies? And how are these difficulties overcome?

    First, it is necessary to consolidate confidence in long-term study. The students at the Workers' and Peasants' Secondary School study for three to four years from enrollment to graduation. After graduation, they prepare to enter Renmin University or other advanced vocational schools, which also takes three to four years. This is a long-term learning process. Some students do not have a clear understanding of this. They only feel the difficulties in their work and urgently demand to study culture to improve themselves, preparing to return to their jobs immediately after leaving school. The school explained the nature and tasks of the school to the students during the entrance examination, so that they could prepare for long-term study ideologically. For example, Comrade Wang Jie of Class A said, "Before enrolling, I gritted my teeth and reluctantly made the decision to prepare for long-term study. After group discussion, I had a clear understanding of learning."

    Second, it is necessary to overcome the lack of planning in learning. Although the idea of long-term study has been initially established, some students feel pessimistic and disappointed about their future studies because of their low level, heavy tasks, lack of planning in learning, grabbing randomly at composition, answering questions, and taking notes, and failing to see their achievements and progress in learning. Some students are afraid that they will not be able to keep up and that the school will order them to drop out and return to their original work units. Some students feel that they cannot complete the learning tasks, and their thinking wavers, and they consider going to cultural supplementary classes. Or they say that their studies have no hope. As a result, the students study desperately, not resting during breaks, not participating in recreational activities, and not going out to play on Sundays. They get up early and go to bed late. This affects everyone's sleep, and almost half of the students suffer from insomnia. For example, Comrade Han Bingsen wrote in his learning summary: "From the day I enrolled, I made up my mind to study for a long time. When classes started, I studied desperately, not resting at noon, and even dreaming about learning arithmetic at night. Therefore, my health was greatly affected. I was so tired that I had headaches and my eyeballs were sore. There were many new characters in the Chinese lessons, and I couldn't understand the arithmetic. I felt that there were many difficulties that could not be overcome. When I studied Chinese by myself, I picked up the book and saw nothing but new characters and new words. The same was true of arithmetic. I didn't even know what odd and even numbers were, and I couldn't perform the calculations. So, the idea of not studying Chinese and arithmetic arose."

    After discovering the above situation, the school immediately convened a forum for teachers and students, first dispelling their worries ideologically, boosting their confidence in learning, and strengthening their determination to overcome difficulties. On the one hand, prevent pessimism in learning, and on the other hand, prevent the "study-at-all-costs" approach. Because these two biases are enemies of learning. At the same time, the following steps were taken in teaching: (1) Consolidate their learning mood ideologically. (2) Improve teaching methods, practice more in class, ask more questions, give more tests, focus on reviewing lectures, and conduct group discussions when necessary, and provide individual assistance to students with low levels. (4) Re-arrange self-study time and increase self-study hours. The students also made learning plans and proceeded step by step.

    In this way, the students in Class C felt more relaxed in their studies, their worries about being returned to their original work units were eliminated, and their mood stabilized. They listened attentively in class and studied according to the prescribed time. The students' health also improved. Comrade Liu Yugui, who in the past did not make significant progress despite his efforts due to the fast pace and poor foundation, learned more solidly and gave full play to his initiative in the later stage, when the time was not as tight as before.

    Finally, it is necessary to eliminate students' concerns about their families. Students' concerns about their families are another obstacle to their learning progress. Although this is not a universal problem, it is a serious problem for some students and affects their studies. On the one hand, the school leaders conducted ideological education for them, and on the other hand, provided appropriate subsidies to the families of a few students in terms of material support. This reduced the family concerns of some students. For example, Comrade Wang Jie's studies were affected because he was worried about his grandmother's livelihood. He said in his self-criticism: "Before resolving the conflict between revolutionary interests and personal interests, I went through a very fierce ideological struggle: which is more important, going home to take care of my grandmother or studying? After many talks and education by the organization, I finally got rid of my distress, overcame my vexation, cleared my mind, and worked hard to study."

　　为争取工农在文化上翻身而斗争
    ——记北京实验工农速成中学学习情形
    严蒙
    北京实验工农中学全体同学，来自各个部队、工厂、农村。他们有丰富的斗争经验，曾在战斗中、工作中立过功，受过奖励。他们在学习中有些什么困难呢？这些困难是如何克服的？
    首先是巩固长期学习的信心。工农中学同学由入学到毕业，时间是三年到四年；毕业以后，准备升入人民大学或其他高级专科学校，时间同样是三年到四年。这是一个长期的学习过程。有些同学对这个学习的认识是不够明确的，他们只是在工作中感到了困难，才迫切要求学习文化，提高自己，准备将来出校后马上回到工作岗位上去。学校方面在入学考试时就向同学们说明了学校的性质和任务，使他们在思想上作长期学习的准备。例如，甲班同学王杰同志说：“我在入学前，是咬了牙，勉强下决心作长期学习准备；经小组进行讨论之后，才对学习有了明确的认识。”
    其次是克服学习上的无计划性。长期学习的思想，虽然初步建立了，但由于同学们的程度低，任务重；学习无计划，作文、答题、笔记乱抓一把，不会分配时间，在学习上看不到自己的成绩和进步，因而有些同学对自己的学习前途悲观失望起来。某些同学怕自己跟不上，学校会令其退学，调回原机关工作；某些同学觉得学习完不成任务，在思想上对学习发生了动摇，想到文化补习班去学习；或者说自己的学习没希望了。于是，同学们就拚命的学习，在休息时间也不去休息了，娱乐活动也不参加了，礼拜天也不出去玩了。早起晚睡。这样就影响了大家的睡眠，差不多有半数的同学患了失眠病。例如同学韩炳森在学习总结中写道：“我自从入学那一天起，就下定了长期学习的决心。一开课，就拚命的学习起来了，中午不休息，夜里作梦也在学算术。因此，我的健康就受到了很大的影响，累得头痛，眼球也发疼了。国文课中有许多生字，算术也听不懂，感到困难重重，无法克服。自习国文时，拿起书本一看，不是生字，就是生词；算术也是如此，根本不知道什么是奇数和偶数，无法进行演算。于是，企图不学国文和算术的思想就产生了。”
    校方发现以上情况后，即召集了师生座谈会，首先从思想上打消他们的顾虑，提高他们的学习信心，加强他们克服困难的决心。一方面防止学习上的悲观主义，另一方面，防止拚命主义。因为这两个偏向都是学习的敌人。同时，在教学上采取了下列的步骤：（一）从思想上巩固他们的学习情绪。（二）改进教学法，在课堂上多练习，多问多测验，讲课注重复习，必要时可以进行小组讨论，对程度低的同学进行个别帮助。（四）重新排定自习时间，增加自习时数。同学方面也做了学习计划，按步就班的进行学习。
    这样，丙班同学在功课上感到了轻松，怕退回原机关的顾虑消除了，情绪安定了下来。上课时安心听讲，按照规定时间进行学习。同学们的健康也有了好转。刘玉贵同学，过去因进度快，基础差，虽然努力，但没有显著进步；后一阶段，时间不像过去那样紧了，就学得更结实，并充分发挥了积极性。
    再次是扫除学员对家庭的顾虑。学员对家庭的顾虑是阻碍同学们学习进步的另一个障碍。这虽然不是普遍的问题，但在某些同学中确是一个严重问题，影响了他们的学习。学校领导上一方面对他们进行了思想教育，另一方面在物质上对少数同学的家庭给予适当的补助。这样就减少了某些同学的家庭顾虑。例如王杰同学，因为耽心祖母的生活问题，影响了学习。他在检讨中说：“我在解决革命利益和个人利益的冲突问题之前，是经过了一段非常激烈的思想斗争的：究竟回家照顾祖母重要呢，还是学习要紧？经过组织多次谈话教育以后，我终于摆脱了苦恼，战胜了烦闷，打通了思想，努力学习。”
