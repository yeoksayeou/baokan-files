Xinhua News Agency, North Korea, 7th Telegram: The Korean Democratic Women's Union issued an appeal to women worldwide, the content of which is as follows:

    Our dear friends who desire peace and the future happiness of mankind! Friends who have always protested against all evils that bring misfortune and disaster to mankind, and whose hearts are burning with anguish! We are writing this letter to you from the ruins, in a state of illness caused by the piercing cold wind and blizzard of winter.

    One beautiful June morning, our peaceful life was interrupted by American bombs. We earnestly appeal to you because you have always shown deep sympathy for our misfortune and sorrow, and have always blessed our just struggle to win victory. "No interference in Korea!" This enthusiastic cry has been issued from the most remote corners of the earth, from towns and villages that are not easily found on the map. Everyone has always extended a hand of friendship to us, eagerly hoping for the victory of the Korean people and the defeat of the warmongers. You have always condemned the shameful instigators of war and desired your friends, mothers, and children to live a peaceful and happy life. You have always encouraged us, holding hope for the victory of the Korean people who are fighting to defend freedom and independence and to oppose the brutal aggression of U.S. imperialism.

    The armed intervention of the United States has brought untold suffering and sorrow to our people. The rice painstakingly planted with simple hands has not yet been harvested in the fields, but the granaries have been burned to ashes. Our homes in cities and villages, once the abodes of happy and free life, are now heaps of ruins.

    Countless corpses of our brothers and sisters lie by the roadside. Theaters, clubs, and other cultural institutions in the cities have mostly been destroyed and burned. American bombs have not only flattened cities and villages. These man-eating barbarians also dropped incendiary bombs and flammable mixtures on places where hardly any human traces can be found. Empty houses beside forest trails are burning, virgin forests are burning. Not even a shadow of a person can be seen on the streets. The sound of chickens crowing and dogs barking cannot be heard. The peaceful scene of families gathering around the stove and the songs of labor and construction have all been replaced by angry flames. Everywhere there are curses, everywhere there are eyes filled with hatred and revenge.

    People cannot study Korea using maps and books from six months ago. Some places that were marked as cities and villages on the map six months ago have disappeared without a trace. Where there used to be houses, there are now no houses. Where there used to be orchards and forests, there is now nothing, leaving only bare mountains, rocks, and riverbeds. The places bombed and strafed by American planes were neither trenches nor artillery positions. They were peaceful cities and villages inhabited by workers, farmers, and staff members.

    Since the retreat of the Syngman Rhee army that had invaded northern Korea, especially when the armed intervention forces began to suffer successive defeats, the U.S. Air Force has been conducting its barbaric air raids. American air bandits, engaged in slaughter and destruction, committed their first crime by brutally bombing the picturesque resort area of Wonsan, destroying sanatoriums, local theaters, boys' middle schools, and girls' middle schools, and strafing the people crowding the market. They dropped large numbers of bombs on workers' residential areas in Nampo City and bombed residential areas and markets in the eastern part of Pyongyang.

    Since the American aggressors and their Syngman Rhee puppets began their invasion of northern Korea, what they have destroyed are not military targets but peaceful cities and villages. Their bullets first shoot unarmed old people, women, and children. The first targets of American planes dropping incendiary bombs and flammable mixtures, the first targets they wildly bombed, were not barracks and military trains, but schools where children were studying, hospitals where patients were being treated, churches, theaters, and riverside huts. They poured flammable liquids and dropped incendiary bombs on infants clinging to the breasts of their dead mothers, on women shedding tears of sorrow for their dead husbands who would never return to their side, and on old mothers waiting for their beloved sons to return. The moral standards of American imperialists are not the moral standards of human beings, but the moral standards of beasts: because it is upright, it hates it; because it is lovely, it plunders it; because it is beautiful, it tramples on it; because it is just, it suppresses it; because it is weak, it eliminates it. This is the idea of the American imperialist eagle, and they are doing it.

    Not an inch of Korean soil has not been soaked in the blood of our compatriots. There is no place where the groans of death cannot be heard.

    When the American and Rhee bandit troops retreated, they indiscriminately massacred peaceful Korean citizens and burned villages and cities. It is simply unimaginable that a person could fall to such a despicable state! We are convinced that these are by no means human actions, but the crimes of beasts in human clothing. We saw an infant sucking on the nipple of its dead mother. He had no idea that his mother had been killed and that the source of life would no longer flow from her protruding breast. This infant was the only survivor among the seven hundred Korean men and women compatriots who were shot by American villains on Mount Jugong near Jugong Village in Yongdong County.

    We saw the place where the U.S. military had killed more than twenty young female students. On the bank of the small river surrounding the pine forest, we saw many children's shoes scattered everywhere. The bodies of those young girls had been removed, but their shoes were still scattered on the grass.

    In the small village of Sarori (transliteration) in North Pyongan Province, the American and Rhee bandit troops killed about 50% of the residents. An old Korean woman angrily said to the American and Rhee bandit troops before being executed: "You devils will surely be eliminated!" Such curses could be heard wherever the American and Rhee bandit troops went.

    We heard the groans and curses of our sisters who had been insulted by the Americans and their lackeys. Many of our sisters have committed suicide because they could not bear the humiliation.

    Our respected mothers, wives, and sisters, our dear friends who have always prayed for our happiness and peaceful life: Why are we telling you about our disasters and misfortunes that are enough to cause you pain and distress?! American imperialists have not only mobilized their own soldiers but also the soldiers of their vassal states. Let the mothers and wives of soldiers from the United States, Britain, Australia, New Zealand, Turkey, Thailand, and other countries know what kind of evil deeds their sons and husbands are doing by being sent to Korea. Let them not be deceived by the vain words of American imperialists and their servants in various countries, who with unprecedented hypocrisy call the war of aggression against the Korean people a "struggle for peace and freedom." These words disguise the beastly face of U.S. imperialism.

    We are deeply convinced that our people will triumph, and the peace-loving people of the world will defeat the warmongers. Our glorious People's Army, which has repeatedly demonstrated unparalleled bravery in the arduous struggle, has now launched an offensive together with the Chinese People's Volunteers, encircling and annihilating the enemy forces and advancing smoothly southward.

    We will fight until victory, and we will overcome all difficulties and obstacles.

    Women of the world, our dear sisters who hate all aggression and war, sisters who love peace and freedom, sisters who pray for the happiness of mankind: We express our deep gratitude for your friendship and for your support to our people who are fighting against American aggression and defending world peace and security.

    We thank you for your sympathy and concern for our misfortunes and sufferings. We are deeply convinced that you will give increasing support to our people who are fighting for freedom and justice, for defending peace, and against the instigators of new wars.

    American warmongers are frantically preparing for another world war, intending to submerge the whole world in a sea of blood, just as they have done in our country.

    When the barbarian bandits of the twentieth century—American warmongers—threaten the world with new flames of war, who can predict that your land, your motherland, will not suffer such disasters and hardships as we are suffering today? When U.S. imperialism, infected with the black plague of war, is launching a frantic aggression in its dream of dominating the world, who can predict that the flames of war will not engulf your families, your mothers, fathers, brothers, and sisters all together?

    When American aggressors begin to ignite the flames of a new world war in Korea, we call on you, women of the world: raise the banner of struggle for peace even higher, and unite your ranks more closely in the struggle for the happiness of mankind, for the bright future of our children, and against the imperialist vultures.

    Representatives of the Korean Democratic Women's Union: Park Jung-ae, Yoo Young-joon, Lee Kim-soon, Cho Bok-rye.
                                        January 5, 1951.

　　朝鲜民主妇女总同盟向全世界妇女控诉美帝兽行
    呼吁团结起来为反对美帝而斗争
    【新华社讯】塔斯社朝鲜北部七日电：朝鲜民主妇女总同盟发表致全世界妇女呼吁书，内容如下：
    热望全世界和平与人类将来幸福的我们亲爱的朋友们！对于使人类遭遇不幸与灾难的一切罪恶始终表示抗议、而内心如焚的朋友们！我们在废墟上，在因为严冬刺骨的朔风和凛冽的暴风雪而病倒了的情况下，写这封信给你们。
    一个美丽的六月的早晨，我们的和平生活被美国炸弹打断了。我们向你们热情地呼吁，因为你们对于我们的不幸和悲哀一向表示深切的同情，并且始终祝福我们的正义斗争赢得胜利。“不准干涉朝鲜！”从地球上最偏僻的角落里，从我们在地图上不容易找得到的城镇和乡村里都发出这种热情的呼号。大家始终向我们伸出友谊的手，热望朝鲜人民胜利，热望战争贩子们败北。你们始终谴责可耻的战争煽动者们，而热望你们的朋友们、母亲们和孩子们过着安宁幸福的生活。你们始终在鼓励我们，对于为保卫自由与独立、为反对美帝国主义的残酷侵略而战的朝鲜人民的胜利抱着希望。
    美国的武装干涉已为我国人民带来说不尽的苦难与悲哀。用俭朴的双手辛辛苦苦种植起来的稻子，在田里还没有收割，但谷仓已被焚为灰烬了。城市和乡村中的我们的家园，曾经是幸福的自由生活的故居，现在是一堆废墟了。
    路旁躺着我们兄弟姊妹们的无数尸体。城市中的剧院、俱乐部和其他文化机关，大都被破坏、被烧毁了。美国炸弹不仅炸平了城市和乡村。这些吃人生番并且向那些简直找不到人迹的地方，也投下烧夷弹和易燃性混合物。林间小路旁的空屋在燃烧中，处女森林在燃烧中。在街上连人影也看不到。听不见鸡鸣犬吠声。家庭骨肉围炉谈心的承平景象，以及劳动与建设的歌声，全都由愤怒的火焰代替了。处处听到诅咒声，处处见到充满着憎恨与复仇的光芒的眼睛。
    人们不能够用六个月以前的地图和书籍来研究朝鲜了。六个月前在地图上标志为城市与乡村的若干地方，一点痕迹都没有了。本来有房子的地方，现在没有房子了。本来种植着果树和森林的地方，现在什么都没有了，留下来的只有光光的山、岩石与河床。被美国飞机轰炸和扫射的那些地方，既不是战壕也不是炮兵阵地。那些都是工人、农民和职员居住的和平的城市与乡村。
    自从曾向朝鲜北部进攻的李承晚军队溃退以来，尤其在武装干涉军开始接连吃败仗的时候，美国空军就进行它那野蛮的空袭。美国空中强盗，干着屠杀和破坏的勾当，犯第一次罪行时，就使元山风景如画的疗养区，受到野蛮的轰炸，把那些休养所、地方剧院、男子中学和女子中学的校舍都炸毁了，并且扫射正拥挤在市场上的人民。他们向南浦城中工人住宅区投下大批炸弹，并且轰炸平壤市东部的住宅区和该城的市场。
    美国侵略者及其李承晚傀儡们自从开始向朝鲜北部进攻以来所摧毁的，并不是军事目标，而是和平的城市与乡村。他们的子弹首先射击没有武装的老弱妇孺。美国飞机投掷烧夷弹和易燃性混合物的第一批的目标，他们所狂炸的第一批目标，并不是兵营和军事列车，而是孩子们在那儿求学的学校、病人在那儿治疗的医院、教堂、剧院和河边小屋。他们向那些伏在已经死去的母亲的乳房上哭泣着的婴儿们，向那样哀悼永远不会回到她们身边来的死去的丈夫而流着伤心泪的妇女们、向那些期待着爱子归来的老母们，倾注易燃性的液体，投掷烧夷弹。美国帝国主义者们的道德标准不是人类的道德标准，而是禽兽的道德标准：因为那是正直的，所以痛恨它；因为那是可爱的，所以掠夺它；因为那是美丽的，所以践踏它；因为那是正义的，所以压制它；因为那是弱小的，所以消灭它。这是美国帝国主义凶鹰的主意，而且他们正在这样干。
    朝鲜没有一寸土地不曾为我们同胞的鲜血所浸透。没有一处地方听不到死亡的呻吟。
    当美、李匪军溃退时，他们不分青红皂白地屠杀和平的朝鲜公民，焚毁乡村和城市。简直不能想像人会堕落到如此卑鄙的地步！我们确信，这些决不是人的行为，而是衣冠禽兽的罪行。我们看到一个婴儿噙着已经死去的母亲的乳头。他那里知道他的母亲已被杀死，生命的泉源已经不会再从她那突起的乳房里流出来了。这个婴儿，是在永同县朱共里附近朱共山上被美国恶棍们枪毙的我国七百名男女同胞们中间唯一的侥幸还活着的人。
    我们看到美军曾在那里杀死了二十多个小女学生的地方。在环绕着松树林的那条小河的岸上，我们看见许多儿童的鞋子丢在各处。那些小姑娘们的尸体已被移去，但是她们的鞋子还散布在草地上。
    在平安北道沙罗里（译音）小村中，美、李匪军将百分之五十左右的居民杀死了。一个朝鲜老太婆在被处死以前很愤怒地对美李匪军说：“你们、魔鬼们，一定会被消灭的！”在美李匪军强盗所到之处，都可以听到这样的诅咒。
    我们听到被美国人和他们走狗们所侮辱的我们姊妹们的呻吟和诅咒。我们的许多姊妹们已经因为不堪忍受污辱而自杀了。
    我们所敬重的母亲们、妻子们、和姊妹们，一直为我们的幸福与和平生活而祝祷的我们亲爱的朋友们：为什么我们要把那些足以引起你们痛苦和难受的我们的灾难和不幸告诉你们呢？！美国帝国主义者们不但动员了他们自己的士兵，也动员了附庸国家的士兵。让美国、英国、澳大利亚、新西兰、土耳其、泰国和其它国家士兵的母亲们和妻子们知道：他们的儿子们和丈夫们被派到朝鲜去是在做着何等罪恶的行为。让她们不要被美国帝国主义者们和他们在各国的奴仆们的虚妄的言论所欺骗，他们以空前的伪善把对朝鲜人民的侵略战争称做“为和平与自由而进行的斗争”。这些话伪装了美帝国主义的兽性的面孔。
    我们深信我们人民会胜利，全世界爱好和平的人民将战胜战争贩子们。我们的光荣的人民军，在艰苦斗争中已经一再显示出无比的英勇，现在已经和中国人民志愿军一道发动攻势，正在包围和歼灭着敌军，向南方顺利前进。
    我们将要作战直到胜利为止，我们将要克服一切的困难和险阻。
    全世界妇女们，憎恨一切侵略和战争的我们亲爱的姊妹们，爱好和平与自由的姊妹们，祝祷人类幸福的姊妹们：我们对你们的友谊、对你们给与为反抗美国侵略和保卫全世界和平与安全而斗争的我国人民的支持，表示深切的感谢。
    我们感谢你们对我们的不幸和痛苦所表示的同情与关切。我们深信你们对于为自由与正义，为保卫和平与反对新战争煽动者而斗争的我国人民，将会给与日益巨大的支持。
    美国战争贩子们正在疯狂地准备着另一次世界大战，打算把全世界淹没在血海里面，像他们在我国所做的一般。
    当二十世纪的野蛮匪徒——美国战争贩子们——用新的战火威胁全世界的时候，谁能预言在你们的土地上，在你们的祖国不会有如我们今天所遭受的这样灾难和困苦呢？当传染了战争黑死病的美帝国主义为了梦想统治世界而在发动疯狂的侵略时，谁能预言战火不会把你的家庭、你的母亲们、父亲们、兄弟们、姊妹们都一齐卷在里面呢？
    当美国侵略者在朝鲜开始燃起企图发动新世界大战的火焰时，我们号召你们，全世界妇女们：更高地举起为和平而斗争的旗帜，在为人类的幸福、为我们儿女的光明的前途、为反对帝国主义者饿鹰而进行的斗争中，把你们的队伍更紧密地集合起来。
    朝鲜民主妇女总同盟代表：朴正爱、刘英俊、李金顺、赵福礼。
                                        一九五一年一月五日。
