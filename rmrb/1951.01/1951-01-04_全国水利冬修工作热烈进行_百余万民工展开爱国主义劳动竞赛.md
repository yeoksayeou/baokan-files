National Winter Water Conservancy Work in Full Swing
    Over a Million Laborers Launch Patriotic Labor Competition
    Since November of last year, large-scale national winter water conservancy projects have commenced successively, mobilizing over 1 million laborers. Laborers on various rivers are now widely engaged in patriotic labor competitions, which not only ensures the quality of winter repair projects on each river but also greatly improves the work efficiency of the laborers.

    This year's key national winter water conservancy projects mainly include: the comprehensive management project of the Huai River basin, the Yellow River levee restoration project, the Shu and Yi River management projects in Shandong and northern Jiangsu, and the management, restoration, and dredging of the Chao Bai, Yongding, Ji Yun, Ziya, and Daqing rivers in Hebei Province. In addition, levee restoration and reinforcement work have been carried out in a focused manner in the Pearl River basin and the Yangtze and Han River areas.

    The massive Huai River management project commenced fully in late November of last year, mobilizing over 400,000 laborers, with tens of thousands of transport vehicles and ships participating in the work. After a month of efforts by all the laborers, the Laowangpo depression flood storage project in Henan Province in the upper reaches of the Huai River and the Chushan Dam and Bihu Dam levee reinforcement projects on the Grand Canal in northern Jiangsu in the lower reaches have been completed. The Bengbu enclosure dam in the middle reaches is nearing completion, and key dredging projects on various tributaries in the middle reaches are also underway.

    In northern Jiangsu Province, dredging of the central channel of the New Yi River began in late November, along with the management of the New Yi River banks and the main drainage channels in the Huaiyin and Yancheng special districts. By the end of November, half of the entire winter repair project had been completed. The fourth phase of the Shu River management project in Shandong Province, mainly involving the excavation of stone for the new Yi River estuary diversion channel, dike construction in the upper and middle reaches of the Sha River, and the excavation of culvert foundations, had completed half of the entire project by mid-December and is expected to be completed by the end of the year.

    In addition, the Yellow River's key projects of widening major dikes and repairing dangerous sections, as well as the Hebei Province's Chao Bai River system's levee reinforcement and dredging of the Qinglongwan River and Kuangergang River, and the Yongding, Ji Yun, Ziya, and Daqing rivers' levee repairs, have all been completed. The Yellow River winter repair project has completed 2.41 million cubic meters of earthwork. The rivers in Hebei have completed 2.16 million cubic meters of earthwork and 176 dam blockages.

    Before the commencement of large-scale winter water management projects, all localities fully carried out the mobilization and organization of laborers. The Huai River Management Committee and the Anhui North Production Relief Temporary Huai River Management Headquarters convened special meetings before the start of the Huai River management project to discuss specific issues of mobilizing and organizing laborers. Anhui North also dispatched a large number of cadres to the countryside to carry out mobilization and organization work. Bengbu City established nurseries near the construction sites to take care of the children of women laborers working on the dikes. Huaiyang, Henan, and other places held meetings of laborer representatives at the construction sites to resolve specific difficulties encountered by the laborers after starting work. Jiangdu and Xinghua counties in northern Jiangsu held winter repair meetings and invited many model laborers to participate in order to learn from their experiences and promote them in winter repair work. To ensure the health of the laborers, health stations or medical teams were established at the construction sites in Anhui North and Jiangsu North.

    After the above full preparations, the national winter water conservancy projects were launched smoothly. After studying current events and discussing resisting America and aiding Korea, the laborers in various places were even more determined to manage the rivers and launched patriotic labor competitions one after another. The laborers of the Lianshui General Team in the Huaiyin Special District of northern Jiangsu held a representative conference of 2,000 cadres and laborers. After the meeting, the laborers issued challenge letters to 140,000 laborers in Huaiyin, Siyang, Suqian, and other counties, promising to do the river management work quickly and well. In the Yellow River levee restoration work, the laborers of Pingyuan Province proposed the "100,000 Pioneer Movement." Currently, there are 265 collective model individuals in Henan and Pingyuan provinces whose levee restoration efficiency exceeds 10 cubic meters. The average laborer in these two provinces does 4 cubic meters per day, exceeding the average efficiency of the spring repair project by 1 cubic meter. Shandong Province also put forward encouraging slogans such as the "Red Flag Competition." The laborers of the Shaobo Brigade in Yancheng Special District of northern Jiangsu even formulated ten patriotic labor covenants to resist America, aid Korea, and defend their homes, greatly enhancing the laborers' enthusiasm for levee repair. In addition, thousands of Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, and model laborers played an active leading role in the competition, ensuring not only the quality of the project but also greatly improving the efficiency of the laborers in repairing the dikes. Zhao Jixian, a laborer from Shou Zhang County, Pingyuan Province, created a national record of 29.7 cubic meters of earth pushed in one day during the competition. Zhang Guangliang and Zhu Desen, two Youth League members from Piyi County, Shandong Province, who diverted the Shu River, split 115 cubic meters of earth in one day. Now this great patriotic competition movement is continuing to be carried out enthusiastically everywhere.

### 全国水利冬修工作热烈进行  百余万民工展开爱国主义劳动竞赛

　　全国水利冬修工作热烈进行
    百余万民工展开爱国主义劳动竞赛
    全国大规模的水利冬修工程于去年十一月内先后开工，共动员民工达一百多万人。各河民工现正广泛地展开了爱国主义劳动竞赛，不仅保证了各河冬修工程的质量，而且使民工工作效率大大提高。
    今年全国水利冬修工程的重点主要是：淮河流域的根治工程，黄河复堤工程，山东、苏北的导沭、整沂工程及河北省的潮白、永定、蓟运、子牙、大清等河的整理、复堤和疏浚等工程。此外，珠江流域及长江、汉水地区亦有重点地进行了复堤和培修工作。
    规模巨大的治淮工程于去年十一月下旬全线动工，共动员民工四十多万人，参加治淮工作的运输车辆和船只数以万计。经过全体民工一个月的努力，现淮河上游河南省老王坡洼地蓄洪工程及下游苏北运河的褚山坝、壁虎坝堤防培修工程已全部完工，中游蚌埠圈堤即将完成，中游各支河的重点疏浚工程，亦正在紧张进行。
    苏北区十一月下旬开始挖新沂河中泓水道，并整理新沂河两岸和淮阴、盐城两专区的主要排水道。至十一月底止，全部冬修工程已完成二分之一。山东省的四期导沭工程，主要是开挖沭河新入海道引河的石方工程、沙河上中游筑堤及开挖涵槽基础等工程至十二月中旬已完成全部工程的一半，预计年底结束。
    此外，黄河重点加宽大堤，修整险工堤段；河北省潮白河水系的青龙湾河、筐儿港河的堤防培修、疏浚，永定、蓟运、子牙、大清等河堤防的修整等，均已全部完工。黄河冬修工程共完成土方二百四十一万公方。河北各河共完成土方二百十六万公方，堵坝一百七十六处。
    在大规模的冬季治水工程开始以前，各地均充分地进行了民工的组织动员工作。治淮委员会及皖北生产救灾临时治淮指挥部在治淮工程开始前均曾召开专门会议，讨论动员和组织民工的具体问题。皖北区并派遣大批干部下乡，进行动员组织工作。蚌埠市特在工地附近设立了托儿所，为上堤的妇女民工照顾孩子。河南淮阳等地并在工地召开民工代表会议，解决了民工上工后的具体困难。苏北江都、兴化两县曾分别召开冬修会议，邀请了许多修堤劳模参加，以便吸取经验，在冬修工作中普遍推广。为了保障民工的健康，皖北、苏北各工地都分别在工地成立了卫生站或医疗队。
    经过以上的充分准备之后，全国各地的水利冬修工程即顺利展开。各地民工在工作中学习了时事、讨论了抗美援朝以后，更加增强了治河的决心，纷纷展开爱国主义的劳动竞赛。苏北淮阴专区涟水总队的民工曾召开了一个二千名干部民工的代表大会，会后，民工们即向淮阴、泗阳、宿迁等县十四万民工下挑战书，保证把治河工作作得又快又好。在黄河复堤工作中，平原省民工提出“十万先锋运动”。现河南、平原两省复堤效率已超过十公方以上的集体模范人物有二百六十五人；该两省平均每个民工每天做四公方，超过春修工程的平均效率一公方。山东省也提出“夺红旗运动”等鼓动口号。苏北盐城专区邵伯大队的民工更订出了十条抗美援朝保家卫国的劳动公约，大大提高了民工的修堤情绪。加之成千的共产党员、青年团员和劳动模范们在竞赛中起着积极的带头作用，因而工程的质量不仅获得了保证，民工修堤效率也大为提高。平原省寿张县民工赵继宪在竞赛中创造了一日推土二十九公方七的全国最高纪录。山东邳县导沭民工、青年团员张广亮、朱德森两人一天劈土达一百十五公方。现在这一伟大的爱国主义竞赛运动，正继续在各地热火朝天地开展着。
