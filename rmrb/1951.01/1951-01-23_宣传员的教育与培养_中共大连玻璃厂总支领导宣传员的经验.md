    — Experiences of the General Branch Leadership of the CCP Dalian Glass Factory in Training Propagandists

    The General Branch of the CCP Dalian Glass Factory established its propagandists in late July of last year. By the end of last year, it had developed to an average of one propagandist for every ten workers. Among them, Party members accounted for 45 percent, Communist Youth League members accounted for 28 percent, and active workers in production accounted for 27 percent. These propagandists were able to closely integrate with the production tasks of their respective workshops to conduct regular propaganda work, and timely and profoundly resolve various vague and incorrect thoughts of the masses in production and life, ensuring the completion of production tasks in various periods.

    The General Branch of the Dalian Glass Factory attaches great importance to the education and training of propagandists in leading the work of propagandists.

    What propagandists felt they lacked most were professional knowledge of propaganda work and propaganda materials. The General Branch of the Dalian Glass Factory realized this demand of the propagandists and organized propagandist training classes in their spare time (training time was one week), using the method of summarizing work, exchanging experience in propaganda work, and formulating future work plans at the end of the study. After this short-term training, the propagandists learned a lot of basic knowledge of propaganda and experience in propaganda work, and solved some problems in past propaganda work. For example, the radio station used to be managed by the head of the electrical department, and it was turned on and off irregularly, making it impossible to conduct regular broadcasts. Now, a propagandist is designated to manage it and is responsible for organizing workers and cadres from various workshops to speak (introducing work experience, work situations, and current affairs speeches, etc.) and relaying news about production and current affairs from newspapers and radio stations. In this way, the radio station can not only conduct regular broadcasts, but also the content of the broadcasts is enriched and planned. This lays the foundation for propagandists to consciously and actively carry out propaganda work among the masses.

    Whether it is a production campaign or the domestic and international situation, it is constantly developing and changing, and the propaganda tasks facing propaganda work also develop and change accordingly. In order to enable the propagandists to play a role in various movements and stand at the forefront of the movement to guide its progress, the General Branch established a regular learning system for propagandists. When launching the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, the General Branch first gave propagandists a report on current affairs and mobilized them to conduct discussions. Subsequently, the propagandists went to the workers to collect various ideological reflections and questions. The General Branch then gave reports to all workers based on these questions. After the reports, the propagandists went to mobilize the workers to hold discussions. This can indeed solve various ideological problems among the masses more profoundly. During this Resist America, Aid Korea movement, fifteen reports were given and more than twenty discussions were held. When deploying the production tasks for the fourth quarter, the propagandists were similarly organized to study in light of the current production problems in each workshop and the ideological problems existing among the workers. This made the propagandists clearly understand ideologically what problems should be solved in their own workshops and how to solve them.

    This still cannot solve all the problems in the work of the propagandists. Sometimes propagandists still encounter some difficult problems in their work. Therefore, the General Branch stipulated that a joint meeting of the group leaders of propagandists from each workshop should be held once a week to listen to reports on the work of each workshop, solve the difficult problems encountered by the propagandists, and deploy the propaganda work for the following week. The propagandist of the plate-making department once raised the question of how to solve the shortcomings of glass having a large belly or running off. After everyone's research, it was discovered that these shortcomings were caused by the uneven control of the wind temperature by the melting department and the uneven removal of furnace ash by the gas department. The propagandists of the melting department and the gas department, after returning, exposed the above-mentioned shortcomings and called on the workers to work hard to overcome them. Through everyone's efforts, these shortcomings were quickly overcome, and the quality of products was improved. For another example, in current affairs study, the masses raised the question: "Taiwan is our territory, why don't we go to liberate Taiwan but instead go to help Korea?" The propagandists could not answer at that time. This question was answered through this meeting, and it was recognized that this was a narrow nationalist ideology. In this way, the prestige of propaganda work among the masses was enhanced, and the propagandists were more motivated to work. Before convening this meeting, the General Branch also paid attention to contacting the administration to understand the problems existing in the production of each workshop in the previous week and the tasks for the following week, so that propaganda work could closely cooperate with administrative work.

    The General Branch also stipulated that a propagandist conference should be held once a month; the method of typical reports should be used to exchange experience in propaganda work. In October, the General Branch helped propagandist Han Shuzhong make a typical report on the experience of combining specific production problems and the current affairs propaganda of workers' lives. This kind of experience exchange conference can not only rapidly improve the working level of propagandists, but also check the leadership work of the General Branch over the propagandists.

    The reason why most of the propagandists in the Dalian Glass Factory can continuously solve the ideological problems of the masses in various movements, realize the Party's policies and tasks, and closely connect the Party with the masses is mainly because the General Branch of the factory has carried out regular education and training for them, enabling them to well complete the propaganda tasks given by the Party.

　　宣传员的教育与培养
    ——中共大连玻璃厂总支领导宣传员的经验
    中共旅大市委宣传部  宣传科副科长  田基贵
    中共大连玻璃工厂总支在去年七月下旬就建立了宣传员，至去年年底已发展到平均每十名工人中就有一名宣传员。其中党员占百分之四十五，团员占百分之二十八，生产中的积极分子占百分之二十七。这些宣传员都能够紧密的结合着本车间生产任务进行经常的宣传工作，及时地深刻地解决了群众在生产和生活中各种模糊的和错误的思想，保证了各个时期的生产任务的完成。
    大连玻璃厂总支在领导宣传员工作上，很注意对宣传员的教育与培养问题。
    宣传员最感缺乏的是宣传工作业务知识与宣传资料，大连玻璃厂总支体会到宣传员这一要求，即以业余时间举办了宣传员训练班（训练时间一星期），采用总结工作的方式，交流宣传工作经验，并在学习结束时，订出今后工作计划。经过这一短期训练，宣传员就学得很多宣传基本知识与宣传工作经验，并解决了过去宣传工作中的一些问题。例如广播站过去是由电气部长管理，时开时停，不能进行经常性的广播；现在就指定一宣传员管理，并负责组织各车间工人和干部讲话（介绍工作经验、工作情况和时事演讲等）及转播报纸和电台有关生产、时事的消息。这样一来，广播站不仅能够进行经常性的广播，并且广播内容也充实而有计划了。这给宣传员打下了能有意识的主动的向群众进行宣传工作的基础。
    无论是生产运动，国内外形势，都是不断发展变化的，摆在宣传工作面前的宣传任务也就随着发展变化。总支为使宣传员在各个运动中能够发挥作用，并能站到运动前面指导运动前进，所以建立起宣传员的经常的学习制度。在开展抗美援朝运动时，总支首先给宣传员作了时事报告，并发动宣传员进行讨论。随后宣传员到工人群众中去收集各种有关的思想反映和问题。总支就根据这些问题给全体工人作报告。报告完了再由宣传员去发动工人进行座谈。这样确实能够比较深刻地解决群众中的各种思想问题。在这次抗美援朝运动中，曾报告了十五次，座谈了二十余次。在布置第四季度生产任务时，同样的组织宣传员结合当前各车间生产和工人思想中存在的问题进行了学习。使宣传员从思想上明确了解到应该在自己的车间里解决些什么问题和怎样去解决。
    这还不能解决宣传员工作中的一切问题。有时宣传员在工作中还是遇到些疑难问题。因此总支规定了每星期召开一次各车间宣传员小组长联席会，听取各车间工作汇报和解决宣传员遇到的疑难问题，并布置下星期的宣传工作。制版部宣传员有次提出如何解决玻璃出大肚或溜子的缺点。经大家研究后，发现了产生这些缺点是由于溶化部对风象温度掌握的不匀和瓦斯部扒炉灰不匀的缘故。溶化部和瓦斯部的宣传员，回去后揭露了上述缺点，并号召工友努力克服。经过大家努力，很快地克服了这些缺点，提高了产品质量。又如在时事学习中，群众提出：“台湾是我们的国土，我们为什么不去解放台湾，反去帮助朝鲜？”宣传员当时解答不了。通过这个会议解答了这个问题，并认识了这是一种狭隘民族主义思想。这样宣传工作在群众中的威信提高了，宣传员工作劲头更足了。总支在召开这一会议前还注意与行政上取得联系，了解各车间上星期生产中存在的问题和下星期的任务，以便宣传工作能够密切配合行政工作。
    总支还规定每月召开一次宣传员大会；采用典型报告办法交流宣传工作经验。十月份总支帮助宣传员韩树忠作了关于结合生产具体问题和工人生活的时事宣传经验的典型报告。这种交流经验大会，不仅能够迅速提高宣传员工作水平，同时检查了总支对宣传员的领导工作情况。
    大连玻璃工厂大部分宣传员，所以能够连续不断地解决了群众在各种运动中的思想问题，实现了党的方针任务，密切了党与群众的联系，主要是由于该厂总支对他们进行了经常的教育与培养，使他们能够很好地完成党所给的宣传任务。
