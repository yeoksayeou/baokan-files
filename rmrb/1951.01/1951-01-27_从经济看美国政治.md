　　Seeing American Politics from an Economic Perspective
    Chen Hansheng
    The rise of American imperialism occurred later than that of British, French, and German imperialism. In the twenty years following the American Civil War, around 1880, American enterprises secured access to the markets and cheap labor of the American South, as well as the newly developed farms of the West. By transporting cheap wheat to Britain in exchange for machinery, capitalism accelerated its development. By the end of the 19th century, American capitalism had reached the stage of imperialism, leading to the war against Spain, and the seizure of Cuba and the Philippines as colonies. In other words, around 1880, American corporate organizations began to move towards monopoly, and by 1900, they were expanding outwards, embarking on the path of imperialism. The United States is a late-rising imperialist power; in an era where some imperialist nations have already disappeared and others are declining, the seemingly "powerful" United States is also a final stronghold of imperialism.
    The development of American imperialism has only taken place in the short span of sixty years. Therefore, its reactionary experience in politics and diplomacy is far inferior to that of Britain. Even now, it still does not have as much understanding of the socio-economic conditions of colonies as British imperialism, and it exhibits the demeanor of a nouveau riche in its foreign relations. The so-called "Far East experts" (i.e., experts in aggression in the Far East) cultivated by American imperialism mostly lack knowledge. For example, in April 1947, Princeton University held its bicentennial celebration and convened many academic research conferences, one of which was the Far East Problem Research Conference, attended by more than thirty professors and experts. Although they discussed various aspects of China, such as China's social structure, politics, and economy, none of them demonstrated a deep understanding of China.
    The development of American imperialist forces was very smooth until the surrender of Japan. This was due to the international relations in Europe, which created conditions for this smooth development. During the First World War, the United States joined forces with Britain and France, and gained great benefits without much effort. During the Second World War, the United States participated on the side of the Allies led by the Soviet Union, and also gained many advantages. In both world wars, American imperialism supported the wars with loans and materials, while contributing relatively little manpower. From the First World War to the Second World War, that is, between 1920 and 1940, the wealth of the United States developed very quickly, rapidly transforming from a debtor nation to a creditor nation, and its foreign investment began to compete with that of Britain. After the Second World War, Britain's power declined due to the loss of India and many markets, and more importantly, its machinery was outdated and its productivity decreased. Therefore, the power of British imperialism became increasingly weaker. Conversely, in the United States, during the six years from 1940 to 1946 in the Second World War, productivity increased by almost one and a half times. Therefore, the power of American imperialism is now able to overwhelm British imperialism and absorb the remaining forces of French, German, Dutch, and Belgian imperialism. In the Near East, American oil investments have already surpassed those of Britain; in various African colonies, American investment is rapidly penetrating the colonies of Britain, France, Italy, and Belgium; in South America, American capital has gradually shifted from the north to the south. German capital has certainly been driven out, and even half of British investment in South America has been ceded to the United States. From these aspects, the large-scale development of American imperialism has only occurred in the last decade.
    The concentration of power in the hands of American financial groups has been particularly rapid in the past decade. During the Second World War, about 500,000 small and medium-sized industrial and commercial enterprises were squeezed out of business. Currently, the national industrial production of the United States is controlled by 250 large corporations. The greatest leaders among these financial magnates are three. First is the Rockefeller financial group, whose influence is the most widespread; second is the Morgan financial group, whose foreign investment is not as large as the former; and third is the emerging DuPont financial group. Generally speaking, these three financial groups jointly lead the internal and external policies of the United States. They have a foothold in both the Democratic and Republican parties, with the Morgan and DuPont financial groups being more active in the Republican Party. Therefore, the two American political parties are essentially no different, and there is no difference in their basic policies of external aggression and internal oppression and exploitation of the American people.
    The three financial groups each have their own characteristics and are also interconnected. Rockefeller is the most experienced, with the widest scope, and its investment focuses on oil. Six out of ten of the largest American foreign investment companies are in the oil business. Therefore, Rockefeller's assets are spread throughout South America, the Near East, and Africa. Since the death of Roosevelt, the power of the Rockefeller financial group has been in the first place in the Washington government. The foreign policy of American imperialism is, of course, closely related to this financial group. The characteristic of the Morgan financial group is that it has close relations with the British banking community and has large investments in Japan, so all its propositions particularly value Japan, especially its strong support for MacArthur. As for the DuPont financial group, it only developed extensively after 1920. Its capital is partnered with Nazi Germany and pre-war French capital, its center of gravity is in Western Europe, it is the most fascist in ideology, and it particularly favors Europe. The internal and external policies of American imperialism are mostly the result of coordination among these three major financial groups.
    In the central region of the United States and some large cities south of Chicago, there is another financial group, whose wealth is only in real estate, insurance, certain light industries, and mail-order companies. Their market is not abroad but at home. The so-called isolationism of the past, which aimed to extend the power of American imperialism to South America rather than to the Old World, was the proposition of this faction. The current representative of this financial group is Taft. In recent years, Taft has been a powerful figure in the US Senate representing the Republican Party in speaking on domestic issues, but the most powerful speaker for the Republican Party on foreign policy issues is Vandenberg. Recently, Vandenberg retired due to illness and was replaced by Dulles. Although Dulles has not served as a senator, he was appointed by Truman as the president's foreign policy advisor and participated in the US delegation to the United Nations. Taft and Dulles are inconsistent on foreign policy, because Dulles completely represents the Rockefeller financial group. The Rockefeller financial group is afraid that American imperialist aggression is too slow and unable to grab raw material markets, etc., while the financial groups in the central United States are unwilling to have American imperialism expand too quickly overseas, so as not to increase the economic pressure they bear. Therefore, Taft's recent remarks often opposed the foreign aggression methods of Truman, Acheson, and Dulles. This reflects the division within the American ruling class.
    Dulles came from a family of politicians and became involved with major financial groups in his youth. As a lawyer, he joined a group of lawyers sponsoring the operation of financial groups. Between 1920 and 1940, he put in a great deal of effort to develop the power of American capital in Western Europe. During the Second World War, the general American public realized that he had pro-fascist tendencies. He himself knew this, so he hid himself in relief work and cultural institutions, serving as chairman of the Rockefeller Foundation for several years. He also lost the Senate election in 1948. Until last year, Truman suddenly appointed Dulles in order to maintain bipartisan cooperation on foreign policy. Previously, bipartisan cooperation on foreign policy had excluded the China issue. Therefore, the Republican Party had used the China issue to attack the Truman administration in the election, using the excuse that Truman was "ineffective" in helping the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. The role of Truman's appointment of Dulles was to include the China issue in the policy of bipartisan cooperation. In the past, cooperation on foreign policy between the two parties had to be voted on in the Senate. Now, it is even more convenient, because Dulles can consult and resolve issues anytime, anywhere, given his position. Therefore, Dulles' importance in today's reactionary American foreign policy is obvious.
    Although Taft speaks for the interests of his financial group, he also somewhat reflects the views of American small and medium-sized industrial and commercial operators and agricultural operators in the central and western United States on American foreign policy. Even Hoover's opinions have to some extent exploited the dissatisfaction of many strata of American society with the current foreign policy of the American government. American small and medium-sized industrial and commercial operators are very clear that they will be squeezed out of business in the expansion of armaments and aggressive wars. The benefits of war preparation and war can only be monopolized by the largest companies; past experience has made them fear bankruptcy in the near future. Agricultural operators in the central, western, and even some parts of the southern United States have also felt the disadvantages of war for them. In the past three years, they have hoped that the government would subsidize the prices of agricultural products so that they could maintain their previous better standard of living, but so far the government has not restored such subsidies. After the outbreak of the war of aggression against Korea, farms in a few places in the United States have felt the lack of manpower and have had to reduce production; most places are under attack economically due to the sudden rise in the prices of agricultural implements and the fall in the prices of agricultural products. They understand that in the process of expanding armaments, the reduction of agricultural implements is inevitable, and the sudden rise in the prices of industrial products is unavoidable, so they do not approve of the war and are willing to have the US military withdraw from Korea. According to the current situation, the anti-war sentiment among these small and medium-sized industrial and commercial operators and agricultural operators is quite popular. But they still lack liaison, organization, and leadership, and therefore cannot wage an effective struggle against the monopoly financial magnates. If they can combine with the working class in the future, then they will gradually demonstrate their power politically. As for Dulles and those people, they are now using various propaganda methods to deceive the middle classes in the cities, buy off yellow trade unions, and manipulate various fascist organizations of veterans, and their momentum is overwhelming, seemingly invincible. However, their foundation is fragile. Due to the failure of American aggressive diplomacy, the position of American monopoly financial magnates within the imperialist bloc has been severely hit, and its domestic position cannot be unaffected. The difficulties encountered by American imperialism at home and abroad will certainly become greater and greater.
    The economic prosperity of the United States caused by the Second World War can be said to have ended at the end of 1948. From November 1948 to July 1949, the productivity of the United States declined quite rapidly, and it was generally acknowledged that an economic panic was about to arrive. The Truman administration tried every means to avoid or at least delay the crisis. The internal cause of the so-called crisis was that the savings of middle-class families during the war were gradually spent, their purchasing power gradually declined, and a contraction phenomenon clearly appeared in the market, which led to the decline of industry and commerce. In the second half of 1949, the situation of industry and commerce was temporarily maintained due to the active expansion of armaments and the sending of large quantities of supplies abroad as "economic aid." In addition, the US government vigorously promoted the large-scale construction of housing and the manufacture of automobiles, and used installment payment methods to promote sales. To buy a car, you can pay in installments over two years; to build a house worth eight thousand US dollars, you only need to pay a few hundred dollars to start construction. In this way, enjoying the current benefits with future income can maintain the general economic situation and prevent people from becoming unemployed. However, even these methods were not enough to delay the arrival of the economic panic. In 1949, the industrial production index was more than one-fifth lower than the peak in 1943. Last year, American imperialism launched the war of aggression against Korea, one of the purposes of which was to delay the economic panic and solve the problem of six million unemployed people. The main purpose of the American aggressors is to use war to support war, to expand various military industries through the war of aggression against Korea, and to make up for the economic loopholes. Sure enough, by August of last year, the total number of unemployed people quickly decreased, and the American economic panic was superficially eased temporarily. From this, it can be concluded that the US imperialist policy of preparing for wars of aggression will not change on its own; only under the combined attack of the powerful world peace and democracy camp and the forces of the American people can its conspiracy be shattered.
    The inevitable failure and collapse of American imperialism has its internal factors. In the 1950-51 fiscal year, the United States' military expenditures, including the military itself, the manufacture of atomic bombs, military aid to Europe, and foreign aid under the Marshall Plan, etc., reached 22 billion US dollars, plus the various military expenditures increased after the launch of the war of aggression against Korea, including war expenses, armament expansion expenses, and increased foreign military aid expenses, etc., totaling 18 billion, totaling 40 billion US dollars. This figure accounts for more than 20% of the total national income of the United States. According to the current situation, by 1953, the preparedness of military forces can bring the national economy into a state of war. According to past experience, such as the figure in 1944, by 1953, military expenditures will account for at least 48% of national income. However, in the last war, the main force in resisting the Nazi army was the Soviet Union. Although the United States mobilized 12 million military personnel and spent a lot of supplies, the wars it participated in were all on the edge of the enemy's positions. If the United States launches a new war of aggression, military expenditures will definitely be more than the scale of 1944. Moreover, the US deficit finance is increasing day by day. Before the war of aggression against Korea, the government's debt had reached 255 billion US dollars. Last year, the government's credit loans to the private sector, public utility construction, and educational facilities, etc., have been significantly reduced. For example, mail delivery by postmen has been reduced from three shifts a day to one shift. In the last war, the United States was able to manufacture a large number of arms and increase national income at the same time, but in the new war of aggression, it will not be able to do this. The general public, especially trade unions and veterans, etc., who are currently deceived by US government propaganda, will sooner or later realize the disadvantages of war or war preparation for them due to the decline in their living standards. Finally, the degree of the American economic panic reached its peak in 1933, so the prosperity of the last war made the general public go from frugality to extravagance; now, although some people still dream of another wartime prosperity, the fact is that they will only be disappointed, forcing them to go from extravagance to frugality, and forcibly reduce their lives. Therefore, anti-war sentiment cannot but increase. At that time, the combined attack of the world peace and democracy camp and the awakened forces of the American people will promote the complete failure of American imperialism.

　　从经济看美国政治
    陈翰笙
    美国帝国主义的兴起，比英、法、德等帝国主义国家都晚。在南北战争后二十年，即一八八○年左右，美国的企业就取得了美国南部的市场与廉价劳动力及西部新辟的农场，并以廉价的小麦运到英国去换取机器，资本主义就加速发展起来。到十九世纪末年时，美国资本主义即已达到了帝国主义阶段，所以就有对西班牙的战争，夺取了古巴、菲律宾作为殖民地。换句话说，一八八○时，美国的公司组织开始走向垄断，到一九○○时已是向外发展，走上帝国主义的道路了。美国是一个后起的帝国主义；在现在帝国主义国家有的已经消灭，有的正在衰落的时代，表面上还像“强大”的美国也是帝国主义的一个最后堡垒。
    美帝国主义发展起来，不过短短六十年光景。所以，它在政治、外交上的反动经验，远不及英国。一直到现在为止，它还没有象英帝国主义那样比较多地了解殖民地的社会经济，而在对外关系上，处处表现它的暴发户的作风。美帝国主义所培养出来的所谓“远东问题专家”（即侵略远东的专家），大都缺乏知识。譬如一九四七年四月，普林斯顿大学举行二百周年纪念，曾召集许多学术研究会，其中之一是远东问题研究会，参加的有三十多个教授专家。他们虽讨论了关于中国各方面的问题，如中国社会结构，中国的政治、经济等等，可是没有一个人表现了对中国是有深刻的了解的。
    美国帝国主义势力的发展，到日本投降为止，都是很顺利的。这是由于欧洲的国际关系，造成了这种顺利发展的条件。第一次大战时，美国与英、法联合起来，没有费多大力气就得到了很大的利益。第二次大战时，美国参加了苏联所领导的盟国方面，也得了很多便宜。两次大战，美帝国主义都是以借款和物资支持战争，所出人力比较少。从一次大战到二次大战中间，即一九二○至一九四○这二十年中间，美国的富力发展得很快，从负债的国家很快地变成了放债的国家，而对外的投资也已与英国相竞争。到了二次大战以后，英国势力因失去了印度，失去了许多市场，更重要的是它的机器陈旧，生产力降低，因此英帝国主义的势力愈来愈没落了。反过来说，美国在二次大战中，从一九四○年到一九四六的六年之中，生产力增加了差不多一倍半，所以现在美帝国主义的力量能够压倒英帝国主义，并且能够吸收法、德、荷、比帝国主义的残余力量。在近东方面，美国的煤油投资已经压倒英国；在非洲各属地，美国的投资很快地渗入到英、法、意、比的各殖民地去；在南美，美国的资本从北部逐渐推移到南部，德国的资本固然被赶出，即是英国在南美的投资，也有半数已让给美国。从这些方面看来，美帝国主义大踏步的发展，不过是最近十年的事。
    美国财阀势力的集中，在这十年内特别快。在二次世界大战期间内，有五十万家光景的中小工商业被挤倒了。目前，美国全国的工业生产，都为二百五十家大公司所控制。这些财阀中的最大领袖有三个。首为洛克斐勒财团，势力最为普遍；其次是摩根财团，对外投资不及前者；第三是新兴的杜邦财团。大体讲来，这三个财团联合地领导着美国的内外政策。它们在民主、共和两党中都插足，摩根与杜邦两个财团在共和党中势力更活跃。所以，美国的两个政党在本质上毫无差别，在对外实行侵略、对内压迫与剥削美国人民的基本政策上也无歧异。
    三个财团各有其特点，而又互相结合。洛克斐勒最老练，范围最广大，投资侧重在煤油方面。美国对外投资的十分之六属于十家大公司，而这十家中就有六家是经营煤油的。因此，洛克斐勒的资产布满于南美、近东和非洲。罗斯福逝世后，洛克斐勒财团的势力在华盛顿政府中要占第一位。美帝国主义的外交政策当然与这个财团有密切关系。摩根财团的特色是与英国银行界有密切关系，而在日本有大批投资，所以它的一切主张特别重视日本，尤其是极力支持麦克阿瑟。至于杜邦财团，则是一九二○年以后才广大发展起来的，它的资本是与纳粹德国、战前法国的资本合伙，重心是在西欧，意识上最法西斯化，并特别偏重欧洲方面。美帝国主义的内外政策大都是这三个大财阀集团协调的结果。
    美国中部地方和芝加哥以南的一些大城市，那里另外有一个财团，它们的富力只是在地产、保险事业、某些轻工业及邮递买卖公司等方面，它们的市场不在国外而在国内。过去的所谓孤立主义，是要把美帝国主义的势力伸张到南美而不要到旧大陆去，就是这派人的主张。目前代表这个财团的人物便是塔夫脱。近年来，在美国参院中塔夫脱是代表共和党对内政问题发言的有力人物，但是共和党对外交问题的最有力的发言人，却是范登堡。最近，范登堡因病退休，起而代之的是杜勒斯。杜勒斯虽没有做参议员，但被杜鲁门任为总统的外交顾问，并且参加了联合国的美国代表团。塔夫脱与杜勒斯在外交政策上是不一致的，因为杜勒斯是完全代表洛克斐勒财团的。洛克斐勒财团唯恐美国帝国主义侵略的太慢，抢不到原料市场等等，而美国中部的财团却不愿意美国帝国主义在海外伸张得太快，以致加重自己所受的经济压力。因此，塔夫脱最近所发表的言论，往往反对杜鲁门、艾奇逊、杜勒斯这一批人的对外侵略的方法。这反映出美国统治阶级内部的分裂。
    杜勒斯出身于政客世家，在少年时即与各大财阀勾结。他以律师身份加入赞助财团经营的律师集团。在一九二○至四○之间，他为在西欧发展美国资本势力，出了很大力气。在二次大战期间，美国一般人都觉察出他有亲法西斯的倾向。他本人也知道这一点，所以隐身于救济事业与文化机关，担任洛克斐勒基金委会主席数年。一九四八年参院的选举中他也落选了。直到去年，杜鲁门因为要保持两党在外交上合作的缘故，突然起用杜勒斯。在以前，两党外交上的合作，曾将中国问题除外。因此，共和党方面曾借口于杜鲁门帮助蒋匪帮“不力”，而以中国问题在选举中攻击杜鲁门政府。杜鲁门起用杜勒斯的作用，便是要将中国问题也纳入于两党合作的政策之中。以前，两党外交政策的合作，要在参院中表决。现在，就更加方便了，以杜勒斯的身份，随时随地都可以协商解决。因此，杜勒斯在今日美国反动外交政策上的重要性是显而易见的。
    塔夫脱固然是为他的财团利益而发言，但是也多少反映了美国中小工商业者与美国中部和西部的农业经营者对美国外交政策的观念。甚至胡佛的意见，也多少利用了美国许多阶层对于美国政府现行外交政策的不满。美国中小工商业者很明了，在扩张军备与侵略战争中，他们是会被挤倒的。备战与战时的利益，只有最大的公司能独占；过去的经验，使他们害怕在最近的将来会破产。美国中部、西部甚至于南部某些地方的农业经营者，也已经感觉到战争对于他们的不利。过去三年中，他们希望政府津贴农产品的价格，使他们能维持以前较好的生活程度，但至今政府没有恢复这样的津贴。在侵朝战争爆发后，美国少数地方的农场已感到人力的缺乏，不得不减缩生产；大多数的地方又因为农耕器具的骤然涨价及农产品价格的低落，农业经济上处于被夹攻的地位。他们明白，在扩张军备的过程中，农耕器具的减少是必然的，而工业品价格的突涨是难免的，所以他们都不赞成战争，愿意美军退出朝鲜。据目前的情形看来，这般中小工商业者及农业经营者们，反战的情绪相当流行。但是他们现在还缺乏联络、组织和领导，因而还不能向垄断的大财阀作有效的斗争。他们今后如能与工人阶级结合起来，那末就将逐渐在政治上表现出他们的力量。至于杜勒斯那些人们，现在用了各种宣传方法欺骗着城市的中等社会，收买了黄色职工会，又操纵着各种退伍军人的法西斯组织，声势赫赫，似乎不可一世。但是，他们的基础是脆弱的。由于美国侵略外交的失败，美国垄断财阀在帝国主义集团内的地位已经受到了严重的打击，它在国内的地位当然也不能不受影响。美帝国主义在国内外所遇到的困难，一定会愈来愈大。
    二次大战所造成的美国的经济繁荣，到了一九四八年底，可以说是结束了。从一九四八年十一月到一九四九年七月，美国的生产力下降得相当快，一般人都承认经济恐慌要来到了。杜鲁门政府想尽方法避免或至少是延缓危机。所谓危机，其内在的原因，就是因为中等家庭在战时的储蓄陆续花光了，他们的购买力就逐渐下降了，市场上显然出现了紧缩现象，因此引起了工商业的倒退。在一九四九年下半年，因为积极扩充军备，并有大批的物资送往国外作为“经济援助”，才暂时维持了工商业的局面。此外，美国政府又极力提倡住屋的大批建筑和汽车的制造，而以赊账的办法往外推销。买一辆汽车，可在两年内分期付款；起一幢八千美金的房子，首先只要付几百元就可以开始建筑。这样，以未来的收入享受现在的利益，才能维持一般经济状况，使人们不至失业。可是，连这种种办法都不足以延缓经济恐慌的到来。一九四九年工业生产指数比一九四三年的最高峰低了五分之一以上。去年，美帝国主义发动侵朝战争，其一个目的便是延缓经济恐慌，解决六百万人的失业问题。美国侵略者主要的目的是以战养战，以侵朝战争来扩展种种军需工业，并弥补经济上的破绽。果然，到去年八月的时候，失业人数的总数很快地减少，美国经济恐慌表面上暂时缓和下来。从此可以断定，美帝国主义准备侵略战争的方针是不会自己改变的，只有在强大的世界和平民主阵线和美国内部人民的力量夹攻之下，才能粉碎它的阴谋。
    美国帝国主义的必然失败和崩溃，是有它内在的因素的。一九五○——五一年度美国军事方面的支出，包括军事本身，原子弹制造，援欧军火以及马歇尔计划的对外援助等等，已达二百二十亿美金，加以侵朝战争发动后所增各项军费，包括战费，军备扩充费，以及对外军援增加费等等，计有一百八十亿，两项共四百亿美金。此数，已占美国全国国民收入百分之二十以上。照目前情形看来，到一九五三年时，备战力量可使全国经济踏入战时状态。按照过去经验，例如一九四四年的数目，到一九五三年时，军事方面支出，至少要占国民收入的百分之四十八。可是上次大战中，抗击纳粹军队的力量主要是出于苏联，美国虽然动员了一千二百万军事人员，花了许多物资，但所参加的战争都是在敌人边缘阵地。美国如再发动新的侵略战争，军事方面的支出决不止一九四四年的规模。况且，美国赤字财政已日在增加。侵朝战争前，政府负债已达二千五百五十亿美金。去年，政府对民间的信用贷款，公用事业的建设以及教育设施等等，已显著减少。例如邮差送信，即已由每天三班减为一班。上次大战中，美国还能一面大量制造军火，一面增加国民收入，而在新的侵略战争中就无法做到这一点。现时被美国政府宣传所欺骗的一般人们，特别是职工会和退伍军人等等，迟早是要因为生活水准降低而觉悟到战争或战争的准备对于他们的不利。最后，美国经济恐慌的程度，在一九三三年曾达到极点，所以上次战时的荣繁是使一般人民由俭入奢；现在虽然还有人梦想再来一次战时繁荣，事实却只有使他们失望，逼得他们由奢入俭，把生活强迫降低。因此，反战情绪就不能不增涨起来。那时，世界和平民主阵线和美国内部人民觉悟力量的夹攻，就会促成美国帝国主义的彻底失败了。
