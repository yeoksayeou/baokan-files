　　Central Ministry of Light Industry Minister Huang Yanpei
    Sends Letter to Beijing's Specialized Handicraft Workers
    Hoping Specialized Handicrafts Will Shift to Practicality and Popularization
    [This Newspaper's News] Central People's Government's Ministry of Light Industry Minister Huang Yanpei recently, due to the difficulty in exporting and selling Beijing's specialized handicrafts, specifically sent a letter to the Beijing handicraft producers, hoping that they would shift towards the direction of popular and practical products. The original letter is as follows:
Beijing Specialized Handicraft Association, forwarded to all producers:
    Because of the failure of its invasion of Korea, American imperialism is blockading our country's foreign trade. The government is putting all its effort into researching the future of specialized handicrafts. Here, I would like to offer some suggestions from a basic policy perspective:
    I have already admired the many specialized handicraft products submitted for foreign exhibitions and displayed at the Central Ministry of Light Industry. These fully demonstrate the noble and exquisite art of our Chinese tradition, and some even display highly ingenious craftsmanship. These are all rare. However, the world situation is changing, and people's minds are also changing. Many good things need to find a new modern direction based on their good foundations. This is precisely the effort that specialized handicrafts need.
    I would like to propose a new direction for specialized handicrafts: First, ornaments should be transformed into practical goods; second, noble products should be transformed into popular products.
    Of course, noble ornaments are still needed. And we must "strive for perfection and promote national essence." However, scientific products, stationery, medical and health supplies, etc., are somewhat close to specialized handicrafts. After their lives improve, the broad masses of people will demand practical works of art, and these will give us the opportunity to manufacture and supply them. Using machinery and incorporating chemistry as much as possible in manufacturing will help with mass production. In order to open up new avenues, walking in this direction may achieve a large sales effect.
    I am not afraid of the American imperialist blockade. This is precisely what is prompting us to be self-reliant and forcing us to look in new directions. Practical and popular, this new direction is precisely the most suitable condition for self-reliance.
    I also know that changing this direction is not easy. It will require considerable effort and time. But this matter is necessary. One day, when the change is successful, we will be overjoyed and embark on a bright road. I say frankly: This is a matter of life and death.
    I am only proposing this direction. Everything depends on the close research of you professionals. I also hope that artists will value this lovely specialized handicraft and give it more guidance. If there is a need for assistance, the government will do its best within its capabilities.
  Sincerely, and with respect,
          Huang Yanpei

　　中央轻工业部部长黄炎培
    函京市特种手工业者     
    希望特种手工艺转向实用和大众化
    【本报讯】中央人民政府轻工业部黄炎培部长近因北京特种手工艺出口外销困难，特函告京市手工艺出品家们，希望他们朝大众化实用品的方向转变。原信如下：北京特种手工艺联合会转诸位出品家：
    美帝国主义，因侵朝失败，封锁我国外贸易。政府对特种手工艺前途，正在用全力研究。这里我想从基本方针上贡献一些意见：
    为了国外展览承送到不少特种手工艺出品，在中央轻工业部陈列，我已经欣赏过了。这些都充分表示了我们中华传统的高贵的精美的艺术，一部分还表现了高度巧妙的匠心。这都是难得的。只是世界大势在变，人心趋向也在变，有许多很好的东西，需要从它很好的基础上，找出一种现代化的新的方向，这样，不但可以维持，还可以发展。特种手工艺正需要用这番工夫。
    我对特种手工艺，愿提出一种新的方向：一、摆设品要变为实用品；二、高贵的出品，变为大众化。
    当然，高贵的摆设品，还是需要的。并且还要“精益求精，发扬国粹”，不过科学用品、文房用品、医药卫生用品等等，有些似和特种手工艺接近的；广大的民众，在生活改进以后，会要求实用的艺术品，这些都给我们以制造供应的机会。在制造上尽可能利用机械，参用化学，将有助于大量生产。为了打开新的出路，望着这个方向走，或者可以取得大量推销的效果。
    美帝封锁我，我不怕的。这正是促成我自立，逼我望新的方向走。实用的，大众化的，这新的方向，恰是自立的最适宜条件。
    我也知道改变这方向，是不太容易的，需要用相当的工夫，也需要经过相当的时间，但事情是必要的。有一天改变成功了，那就欢天喜地，走上光明大道了。我坦直地说：这里是一个生死关头。
    我仅仅提出这方向，一切仰仗诸位专业家自己亲切地研究。还希望艺术家重视此可爱的特种手工艺而多多予以指导。有需要助力处，政府在可能范围内，没有不尽力的。
  专此，并致敬意
          黄炎培
        一九五一年一月十九日
