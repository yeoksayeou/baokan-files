Letter from Lu Zengshan of the Liuzhou-Laibin Engineering Section, Guangxi:
Suggest Strengthening the Distribution of New Year Pictures

Recently, while traveling by train through Hankou, Hengyang, Liuzhou, and other places, I saw many New Year pictures on the market. However, most of these New Year pictures are "New Twenty-Four Filial Exemplars," "Investiture of the Gods," "Pictures of Beauties," and the like, which are full of feudal toxins. It is understood that the local people here have the habit of buying New Year pictures every year, and they very much like New Year pictures with new content. Therefore, I hope that relevant authorities will strengthen the distribution of New Year pictures and promote them to the vast cities and rural areas throughout the country to replace these old New Year pictures that poison the masses.

　　广西柳州来宾工务段卢增善来信：
    建议加强新年画的发行工作
    最近，我乘车经过汉口、衡阳、柳州等地，见到市面上出现了不少年画。但这些年画多半是带有封建毒素的“新二十四孝”、“封神榜”“美女图”之类。据了解，这里的老乡们年年都有买年画的习惯，他们非常喜欢有新内容的年画。因此我希望有关机关加强新年画的发行工作，把新年画推广到全国广大城市和农村中去，以代替这些毒害群众的旧年画。
