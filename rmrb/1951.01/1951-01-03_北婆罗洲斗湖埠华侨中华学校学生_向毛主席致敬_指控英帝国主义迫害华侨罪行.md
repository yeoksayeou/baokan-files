　　North Borneo Tawau Chinese Overseas Chinese School Students
    Pay Tribute to Chairman Mao
     Accuse British Imperialism of Persecuting Overseas Chinese
    [Reported by this newspaper] Li Shuchang, the principal of the Chinese Public Zhonghua School in Tawau, North Borneo, returned to China due to persecution by the British colonial authorities in the area. When he left Zhonghua School, all the students entrusted him to bring a letter to Chairman Mao, which fully expressed their love for the motherland and their respect for Chairman Mao. The original letter is published below:

Dearest Chairman Mao:

We are overseas Chinese students from North Borneo. Today, taking advantage of our principal's return to China, we specially ask him to bring you a letter to express our love for the motherland and our respect for you.

From the previous generation or the generation before that, our ancestors came to this North Borneo, which used to be barren, and engaged in reclamation, planting, and other work with great hardship. As a result of irrigating with blood and sweat, it has now become a place of abundant harvest. However, the price we paid with blood and sweat is not satisfactory. The fruits of our hard work have been swallowed up by the imperialists, and what we get are tears and humiliation! The British imperialists use all kinds of methods to bully, exploit, and devastate us, making us live a very painful and miserable life. We dare not even raise our heads, dare not even breathe. We endure and endure, and tears flow into our stomachs!

The reactionary government of the "Kuomintang" in the past was indifferent to our misfortune. They allowed the imperialists to persecute and bully us. We once placed our hopes on the reactionary government, hoping to get a little support, but each time we were given disappointment and more disappointment.

We now deeply know that the "Kuomintang" of the past did not love the people and did not love the overseas Chinese. Its result proves its behavior.

Thank you, Chairman Mao! You led the great revolution and great liberation of the people of the motherland, transforming the motherland from a semi-colonial and semi-feudal state into a young and healthy one, no longer a motherland ridiculed as poor, ignorant, and backward. From then on, she will stand tall in the world.

The facts of the past year or so have proved that the People's Government is sincerely serving the people. Although it has only been a very short period of time, its achievements have been great. Getting rid of the heavy burden of thousands of years of history, she stands in the morning sun with a refreshing breath and vigorous vitality. She loves the people and will certainly protect the overseas Chinese. Therefore, we have developed unparalleled love and respect for her!

However, the British imperialists are unwilling to see our People's Government serving the Chinese people and sympathizing with the liberation of small and weak nations. Therefore, in front of the overseas Chinese, they do everything possible to slander our country in a despicable manner, and want the overseas Chinese to continue to follow the dead "Kuomintang" in order to achieve their purpose of bullying and exploiting. However, our eyes are sharp, and we have long understood who is right and who is wrong. The imperialists' attempts will be defeated.

The imperialists not only want us to completely forget the motherland, but also try to turn us into mere speaking production tools. Therefore, they try their best to devastate and persecute overseas Chinese education. They do not allow us to hold commemorative days, hang the five-star flag, hang your portrait, sing the national anthem, and even natural wall charts such as airplanes and guns sold by bookstores are not allowed to be hung. Of course, talking about everything about the motherland is even more prohibited. Our principal was unreasonably persecuted and forced to leave the country because he taught us to love you, love the motherland, recognize the new national flag, and sing the national anthem, causing us great loss and pain. Other measures, such as forcing overseas Chinese middle schools to close down and be taken over by reactionary Christian churches (one each in Sandakan and Kudat), and restricting the number of students (from more than 20,000 overseas Chinese students in North Borneo to 7,000), are all outrageous.

Dearest Chairman Mao! We are orphans overseas, and we have suffered enough. How eagerly we hope that you will come to protect us as soon as possible so that we can get fair treatment! We must study hard and learn well, and always be good sons and daughters of the Chinese nation under your banner, be your good students, and work hard for the bright future of the motherland.

Dearest Chairman Mao! We have too much to report to you. Our love for you and the motherland is too strong, and it cannot be expressed in simple words. Let us use our sincere and loving heart to approach you and use it to replace words!

Great and lofty Chairman Mao! Please accept the blessings and respect formed by the loyal hearts of hundreds of us and millions of overseas Chinese! Under your leadership, the glorious and brilliant motherland will grow more beautiful!

Sincerely, all students of Zhonghua School in Tawau, North Borneo
November 8, 1950

Attached: Letter from Li Shuchang, the returning principal of the school, to the editorial department of this newspaper

Comrades Editors:

I am an overseas Chinese educator who recently returned from North Borneo due to persecution by the British imperialist colonial government. When I left my school, the students, in order to express their love for the motherland and their respect for Chairman Mao, specially wrote a letter and secretly brought it back by me. Now, please forward this letter on my behalf. If possible, please publish it so that the compatriots of the motherland can see how the overseas Chinese live overseas; at the same time, it can also let the overseas Chinese know that their love for the motherland and the suffering they have suffered abroad have been valued by the government and people of the motherland, which is a great encouragement and comfort to them spiritually. Greetings!

Sincerely, Li Shuchang, Principal of Chinese Public Zhonghua School in Tawau, North Borneo, December 17, 1950.

### 北婆罗洲斗湖埠华侨中华学校学生  向毛主席致敬  指控英帝国主义迫害华侨罪行

　　北婆罗洲斗湖埠华侨中华学校学生
    向毛主席致敬   
     指控英帝国主义迫害华侨罪行
    【本报讯】北婆罗洲斗湖埠华侨公立中华学校校长黎树昌，因受该地英国殖民当局的迫害而返国。他在离开中华学校时，该校全体学生托他带回一封给毛主席的信，这封信充分表现了对祖国的热爱和对毛主席的尊敬，兹将原信刊载如下：亲爱的毛主席：
    我们是北婆罗洲的华侨学生，今天趁我们的校长回国之便，特地请他带一封信给您，表示我们对祖国的热爱，和对您的尊敬。
    从上一代或者再上一代起，我们的祖先们就来到这过去是一片荒芜的北婆罗洲，在千辛万苦之下从事开垦种植等工作；用血汗灌溉的结果，现在成了收获丰富的地方。然而我们用血汗所换得来的代价不是美满，我们辛勤所收得的果实被帝国主义者一口吞下了，得到的却是眼泪与屈辱！英帝国主义者用尽种种方法来欺侮、压榨、摧残我们，使我们过着非常惨痛而凄苦的生活，连头都不敢抬，气都不敢出，忍受再忍受，眼泪都向肚里流！
    过去的“括民党”反动派政府对我们的不幸是漠不关心的，一任帝国主义者迫害与欺凌，我们也曾把热望寄托过反动派政府，希望得到一丝的支援，然而每次所给予我们的是失望又再加失望。
    我们现在深深地知道了过去的“括民党”是不爱人民，不爱华侨的，它的结果正说明了它的行为。
    感谢您，毛主席！您领导了祖国人民的大革命，大翻身，把祖国由半殖民地半封建的状态一变而为一个又年青又健康，不再是被嘲笑为贫愚落后的祖国，从此她将屹立于世界。
    一年多来的事实证明了人民政府是真心为人民服务的，虽然才是一个很短的时期，然而她的成就已经很大，摆脱几千年历史的重负，她带着苏愉的气息和蓬勃的生机，屹立在朝阳中。她爱人民，更必然是爱护华侨的，因之我们对她发生了无比的热爱和敬仰！
    可是英帝国主义者是不愿意看见有一个为中国人民服务和同情弱小民族解放的我国人民政府的，因之在华侨面前对我国极尽其卑劣诬蔑之能事，要华侨仍跟着死去的“括民党”走，以达到其欺侮压榨的目的。然而我们的眼睛是雪亮的，谁是谁非，早已了然于心中，帝国主义的企图会遭到失败的。
    帝国主义者不但想使我们完全忘记祖国，而且企图把我们变成为只能说话的生产工具，因此对于华侨教育尽量摧残和迫害。它不准我们举行纪念日，挂五星旗，挂您的像，唱国歌，甚至连书局出卖的自然挂图如飞机、枪炮之类都不准悬挂。谈祖国的一切情形当然更是在禁止中。我们的校长就是因为教我们爱您，爱祖国，认识新国旗，唱国歌，而遭到离境返国的无理迫害的，使我们受到很大的损失和痛苦。其他像强迫华侨中学关门，由反动派基督教会接办（山打根、古达各一），限制学生数量（全北婆罗洲华侨学生两万多减为七千）等等措施，无一不是令人发指的。
    亲爱的毛主席！我们在海外作孤儿，苦已受够了，我们多么迫切地希望您赶快来保护我们，使我们能够得到公平的待遇啊！我们必定要好好读书，好好学习，永远在您的旗帜下作中华民族的好儿女，作您的好学生，为祖国美好的将来而努力。
    亲爱的毛主席！我们要向您报告的太多了，我们对您和祖国的热爱太浓厚了，它不是简短的言语所能说得尽的。我们用真诚的、敬爱的心来亲近您，用它来代替语言吧！
    伟大崇高的毛主席！请您接受我们几百颗以及千万华侨忠诚的心所汇成的祝福和敬意！光辉灿烂的祖国在您的领导下会成长得更美丽的！
    北婆罗洲斗湖埠中华学校全体学生敬上
                  一九五○年十一月八日
    附：返国的该校校长黎树昌给本报编辑部的信编者同志：
    我是最近因受英帝国主义殖民地政府迫害而由北婆罗洲回来的一个华侨教育工作者，当我离开我的学校的时候，学生们为了表示热爱祖国和对毛主席的尊敬，特地写了一封信由我秘密地带回来，现在请你把这信代为转交。如果可能的话请把它发表，让祖国的同胞们看看，华侨们在海外是怎样生活的；同时也可使华侨们知道，他们对祖国的热爱和在外所受的痛苦，已经得到祖国政府和人民的重视，在精神上对他们是一个很大的鼓励和安慰。敬礼！
    北婆罗洲斗湖埠华侨公立中华学校校长
        黎树昌谨启  一九五○、十二、十七。
