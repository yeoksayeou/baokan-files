　　A New Stage in the Christian Reform Movement
　　Wu Yaozong

The publication of the "Ways for Chinese Christianity to Strive in the Construction of New China" declaration in the People's Daily on September 23, 1950, along with the signatures of 1,527 responsible individuals from Christian communities across the country, marked the beginning of the Chinese Christian Reform Movement.

The number of signatories to the declaration gradually increased from the initial group of over a thousand to 26,727 by December 7th; and then leapt to 78,596 by December 31st. What excites us the most is that this total includes 32,782 signatures from 472 Church Assembly churches nationwide. Each signatory affixed their own seal or fingerprint. These signatures, when pasted together, formed a roster dozens of meters long. In January 1951, nearly ten thousand signatures were added in just one week.

The declaration signing movement is now flourishing across the country. The December issue of "Hope" magazine, recently received from Chengdu, is a special issue dedicated to the reform declaration, providing detailed reports on the enthusiastic unfolding of this movement in Chengdu. Mobilization meetings for signing the declaration have been held in Yibin and Luxian in Sichuan, Liuyang and Yiyang in Hunan, Wenzhou and Yuyao in Zhejiang, Zhenping in Henan, Taiyuan in Shanxi, Jinan in Shandong, Zhao'an in Fujian, Liuzhou in Guangxi, and many other places. We are even more gratified by the response of Catholic individuals to this movement. In Guangyuan County, Northern Sichuan Administrative Region, more than 500 Catholics jointly issued the "Self-Reliance Reform Movement Declaration" for the first time on November 30th of last year. In early January of this year, 695 people in Chongqing, and over 2,000 people in Nanchang, Gui Sui, Jiajiang in Western Sichuan, and Yuechi County in Northern Sichuan, issued similar declarations. Like Christianity, they also want to sever ties with imperialism and "rely on their own efforts to establish an autonomous, self-supporting, and self-propagating new church."

In conjunction with the signing of the reform declaration, many regional Christian organizations participated in the Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect the Homeland movement, and issued declarations, held parades and demonstrations, opposed the aggression of American imperialism, refuted Austin's shameless lies, drafted patriotic covenants, and launched publicity and learning activities on current events. Christian individuals in Shanghai initiated a donation campaign for aid kits before Christmas. In Wuhan, Christian, Catholic, and church school personnel jointly issued a declaration on December 15th, denouncing Austin's lies. On December 27th, Christian and Catholic organizations, schools, and hospitals in Jinan City held a demonstration parade for the Resist America, Aid Korea, and Patriotic Movement.

In the recent half-month or so, due to the military failure of American imperialism's invasion of Korea, the international situation has undergone a rapid, fundamental, and almost dramatic change. This change, coupled with the progress already made in the Christian Reform Movement, has brought this movement to a completely new stage.

On December 16, 1950, the U.S. government announced the control of Chinese and Korean assets within its jurisdiction and prohibited ships registered in the United States from sailing to Chinese ports. This measure by the United States froze Chinese public and private property in the United States, thus severely affecting the Christian enterprises within China that rely on American funds for their maintenance and the livelihoods of their staff. In response to this unreasonable measure by American imperialism, the State Council of the Central People's Government issued an order on December 28th to control and investigate all properties of the U.S. government and U.S. enterprises in China, and to freeze American public and private deposits in China. On December 29th of the same month, the State Council also announced a decision on the policy for handling cultural, educational, and relief organizations and religious groups receiving American subsidies. A few days later – on January 3rd of this year, 26 responsible individuals from national and local Christian organizations in Shanghai issued a declaration supporting the State Council's decision. This series of developments has brought the Christian Reform Movement to a new situation.

A fundamental element of Christian reform is the movement for autonomy, self-support, and self-propagation, with the self-support movement being particularly urgent. Self-support means breaking away from foreign economic relations, especially American economic relations. At the annual meeting of the National Christian Council held in Shanghai in October 1950, participating representatives unanimously passed a resolution to complete the task of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement within five years. After the annual meeting, some Christian organizations, such as the Jiangsu Diocese of the Chinese Anglican Church and the National General Assembly of the Church of Christ in China, stipulated that this task should be completed within the same period or within an even shorter period. The current developments, however, are forcing us to take more urgent and thorough measures. In Christian enterprises that receive foreign subsidies, American assistance constitutes the main component of their economic resources. Now this economic source has, in fact, been cut off. As a result, the issue of self-support for the Chinese Church is not a matter of three or five years, but a matter of extreme urgency.

Shifting the foundation of Chinese Christian enterprises from reliance on foreign subsidies to self-reliance is not an easy task, but it should not be considered an impossible one. The aforementioned decision of the State Council stipulates certain measures for subsidizing Christian-related enterprises such as some schools and hospitals, which is a great encouragement to us. We are very grateful to the government for such care and compassion. Under this favorable condition, we should, with a bold spirit and a determination to burn our boats, complete the entire self-support plan of Chinese Christian enterprises in the shortest possible time.

Secondly, there is the issue of autonomy and self-propagation. Autonomy is not just about breaking away from foreign management; in fact, under the current circumstances, this is no longer a problem, because there are not many foreign missionaries still in China, and they cannot continue to control the administration of Chinese churches and church enterprises either in fact or in name. Therefore, the slogan of autonomy should take on a deeper meaning, that is: in the management of Chinese churches and church enterprises, get rid of Western traditions and establish systems, regulations, and rituals that suit the needs of Chinese believers. For example, the issue of church unity, the issue of the volunteer system, and the issue of responsible interfaith relations are all related to the issue of autonomy.

As for self-propagation, that is not a problem that can be solved in a short period of time, but a long-term undertaking. Self-propagation is not just a question of "who preaches," but even more so a question of "what to preach." The Chinese Church no longer needs foreign missionaries to preach, this is an obvious fact. But what should Chinese believers preach? Chinese Christianity came from the West. Most of China's missionary talents have been trained in Western theology. Most of the Chinese Christian literature is translations of Western writings. If we are to truly "self-propagate," Chinese believers must discover the treasures of Jesus' gospel for themselves, break free from the shackles of Western theology, liquidate the ideas of escaping reality, and create their own theological system for Chinese believers; only in this way can we express the true spirit of Jesus' gospel in the environment of New China.

The task of Christian reform is not just to complete the "Three-Self"; that is the internal task of Christianity. But it also has an external task, which is what the reform declaration says: "To thoroughly support the Common Program, and under the leadership of the government, to oppose imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and to strive for the construction of an independent, democratic, peaceful, unified, and prosperous New China." In this overall task, the most important and urgent thing at present is to Resist America, Aid Korea, and Protect the Homeland. In this matter, Christianity has already made considerable progress in the past few months, which is gratifying. But we must make this movement more widespread and in-depth. We should launch organized and systematic current affairs learning, especially to deepen our understanding of American imperialism in concrete facts. We should publish more popular readings to link the basic doctrines of Christianity with the current tasks of Christianity. In addition to the work indicated in the Christian Reform Declaration, we should, according to the conditions in various localities, formulate patriotic covenants and concrete action programs, and actively participate in local patriotic activities. We should patiently and skillfully win over the more backward masses within Christianity and unite them widely in the united front of Christian reform.

We believe that if we can do these many tasks well, Christianity can make a contribution to New China, and its future is bright.

### 基督教革新运动的新阶段

　　基督教革新运动的新阶段
    吴耀宗
    一九五零年九月二十三日，北京人民日报发表了“中国基督教在新中国建设中努力的途径”这个宣言，和在这个宣言上签名的全国基督徒一五二七位负责人士的签名，这就是中国基督教革新运动的开端。
    在宣言上签名的，从第一批的一千多人逐渐发展到十二月七日为止的二六七二七人；又从这个数字，飞跃地发展到十二月三十一日止的七万八千五百九十六人。最使我们兴奋的，是包括在这个总数里面的，全国基督徒聚会处四七二个教会的三二七八二个签名。每一个签名的人都盖了自己的图章，或打了指模。这些签名，黏贴起来，成了一个几十丈长的名册。在一九五一年一月，仅在一周之内，便有将近一万人的签名。
    宣言的签名运动，现在正在全国蓬勃地发展着。刚从成都寄到的十二月份的“希望”月刊，是一个革新宣言的专号，里面详细报道了这个运动在成都热烈展开的情况。在四川的宜宾和泸县，在湖南的浏阳和益阳，在浙江的温州和余姚，在河南的镇平，在山西的太原，在山东的济南，在福建的诏安，在广西的柳州，和其他许多地方，都曾举行过宣言签名的动员大会。更使我们欣慰的，就是天主教人士对于这个运动的响应。在川北行政区的广元县，有天主教徒五百余人，于去年十一月三十日首次联名发表“自立革新运动宣言”。在本年一月初，还有重庆的六百九十五人和南昌、归绥、川西的夹江，川北的岳池县，共两千余人发表同样的宣言。同基督教一样，他们也要割断与帝国主义的关系，“自力更生，建立自治、自养、自传的新教会”。
    配合着革新宣言的签名，许多地区的基督教团体，参加了抗美援朝保家卫国的运动，并纷纷发表宣言，游行示威，反对美帝国主义的侵略，驳斥奥斯汀的无耻谰言，拟定爱国公约，并展开对时事的宣传与学习。上海的基督教人士，在圣诞节前发起救护袋捐献运动。在武汉方面，基督教、天主教各教会团体及教会学校人士，曾于十二月十五日联合发表宣言，痛斥奥斯汀的谰言。十二月二十七日，济南市基督教、天主教团体学校、医院举行抗美援朝爱国运动示威大游行。
    在最近的半个多月中，由于美帝国主义侵朝的军事失败，国际的形势发生了一个急速的基本的几乎是戏剧性的变化，这个变化，同基督教革新运动已经获得的发展联结起来，就使这个运动到达了一个完全新的阶段。
    一九五零年十二月十六日，美国政府宣布管制其辖区内中朝两国的财产，并禁止在美国注册的船只驶往中国港口。美国的这个措施，冻结了中国在美国的公私财产，因而严重地影响了中国境内依赖美国款项来维持的基督教事业和它们里面工作人员的生活。中央人民政府政务院针对着美帝国主义这一个无理的措施，于十二月二十八日发布命令，管制并清查美国政府和美国企业在华的一切财产，并冻结美国在华公私存款。同月二十九日，政务院又公布了关于处理接受美国津贴的文化教育救济机关及宗教团体的方针的决定。过了几天——本年一月三日，上海全国性及地方性基督教团体二十六位负责人士，发表了拥护政务院这个决定的宣言。这一连串的发展，使基督教革新运动面临着一个新的局面。
    基督教革新的一个基本内容，是自治、自养、自传的运动，而尤其急迫的是自养运动。所谓自养，就是要脱离外国的经济关系，尤其是美国的经济关系。在一九五零年十月，在上海举行的基督教协进会年会中，参加的代表们，一致通过在五年内完成三自运动的任务。在年会以后，也有若干基督教团体，例如中华圣公会江苏教区，中华基督教会全国总会，规定在同一时期或在一个更短的时期内完成这个任务。目前形势的发展，却逼着我们，使我们不得不采取一个更紧急更彻底的措施。在接受外国津贴的基督教事业中，美国的协助占了它们经济来源的主要成份。现在这一个经济来源，事实上已经断绝。这样一来，中国教会自养的问题，就不是一个三年五年的问题，而是一个急不容缓的问题。
    要使中国的基督教事业，从依赖外国津贴的基础，马上转移到自力更生的基础，并不是一件容易的事，但不应当被认为是一件不可能的事。上述政务院的决定，规定了补助与基督教有关的事业如有些学校、医院等的若干办法，这是对我们一个极大的鼓励。政府对我们这样的照顾与同情，使我们非常感激。在这一个有利的条件下，我们更应当以大刀阔斧的精神，和破斧沉舟的决心，在最短期内，完成中国基督教事业全部自养的计划。
    其次，是自治自传的问题。所谓自治，不只是要脱离外国人的管理；事实上，在目前的情况下，这已经不成问题，因为还留在中国的外国宣教师，已经不多，他们无论在事实上或名义上，均不可能继续掌握中国教会和教会事业的行政。因此，自治这个口号，应当取得一个更深刻的意义，那就是：在中国教会和教会事业的管理上，摆脱西方的传统，建立适合于中国信徒的需要的制度、典章、仪式。例如教会合一的问题，义工制度的问题，友教负责的问题，都与自治的问题有关系。
    说到自传，那就不是一个在短时期内所能解决的问题，而是一件长期的事业。所谓自传，不只是“什么人去传”的问题，而更是“传什么”的问题。中国的教会，已不再需要外国宣教师去传教，这是一个显明的事实。但中国的信徒应当传什么呢？中国的基督教是从西方传来的。中国的宣教人材，大半是受过西方神学的训练的。中国基督教的读物，大半是西方著述的译本。若要真的“自传”，中国的信徒就必须自己去发掘耶稣的福音的宝藏，摆脱西方神学的羁绊，清算逃避现实的思想，创造中国信徒自己的神学系统；这样，我们才能把耶稣的福音的真精神，表现在新中国的环境里。
    基督教革新的任务，不只是完成“三自”；那是基督教对内的任务。但它还有一个对外的任务，那就是革新宣言所说的：“彻底拥护共同纲领，在政府的领导下，反对帝国主义、封建主义及官僚资本主义，为建设一个独立、民主、和平、统一和富强的新中国而奋斗。”在这个总的任务中，目前最重要，最急迫的一件事，莫过于抗美援朝保家卫国。在这一件事上，在过去几个月中，基督教已经有了不少的表现，这是值得我们欣慰的。但我们还要使这个运动更普遍而深入。我们应当发动有组织有系统的时事学习，尤其要在具体的事实中，加深对美帝国主义的认识。我们应当多出版大众化读物，把基督教的基本教义，同基督教当前的任务联系起来。除了基督教革新宣言所指示的工作以外，我们应当按照各地的情况，拟定爱国公约和具体的行动纲领，并积极地参加当地的爱国活动。我们应当耐心地技巧地争取基督教内比较落后的群众，把他们广泛地团结在基督教革新的统一战线里面。
    我们相信：如果我们能够把这许多工作做好，基督教对新中国是可以有贡献的，它的前途是光明的。
