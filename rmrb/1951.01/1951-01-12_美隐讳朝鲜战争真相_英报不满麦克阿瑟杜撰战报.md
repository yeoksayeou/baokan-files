　　U.S. Conceals Truth About Korean War
    British Newspaper Dissatisfied with MacArthur's Fabricated War Reports
    [Xinhua News Agency, 10th] London’s Daily Mirror on the 9th again devoted half of its front page to criticizing MacArthur’s headquarters for lying in its war reports. This marks the third consecutive commentary published by the Daily Mirror in a week. Under the striking headline, "What is the situation in Korea? Even Americans don't know," the newspaper accused MacArthur's headquarters of blocking information. The paper stated, "Only a few officials in Washington know what the situation in Korea is like under MacArthur's command?" The newspaper expressed strong dissatisfaction with MacArthur's headquarters for blocking information and fabricating war reports, saying, "The U.S. government is a curtain between other UN member states and MacArthur. He has no direct contact with other UN governments. MacArthur does not report to the United Nations. All his reports are submitted to the U.S. Department of Defense in Washington." According to the Daily Mirror, its exposure of the "Korean War myth" "has been widely quoted in the United States and is deeply concerning to thoughtful Americans."
    The London Daily Worker commented on the matter, stating that the Mirror's withdrawing reporter, Walker, "told us much about this dirty business. MacArthur's headquarters has been exposed before the world as a completely untrustworthy place, daily fabricating stories of newly increased hundreds of thousands of Chinese troops to explain American failures."

　　美隐讳朝鲜战争真相
    英报不满麦克阿瑟杜撰战报
    【新华社十日讯】伦敦每日镜报九日又以头版一半篇幅的地位，抨击麦克阿瑟总部的撒谎的战报，这是每日镜报一周以来连续发表的第三次评论。该报以“朝鲜的情形究竟怎么样？甚至美国人也不知道”的醒目的标题指责麦克阿瑟总部封锁情报。该报说，“只有华盛顿的少数官员，才知道在麦克阿瑟指挥下的朝鲜局势究竟如何？”该报对麦克阿瑟总部的封锁情报、捏造战报十分不满地说，“美国政府是其他联合国会员国与麦克阿瑟之间的一道帷幕。他和其他联合国政府没有直接的联系。麦克阿瑟并没有向联合国报告。他的所有的报告都是交给华盛顿的美国国防部。”据每日镜报称：该报关于“朝战神话”的揭露，“在美国已被广泛引用，并深深地受到有思想的美国人的关怀。”
    英国伦敦工人日报评论此事时称：镜报的撤退记者华克“告诉了我们关于这个污秽的事业的许多情况。麦克阿瑟总部已在世人面前暴露了是一个完全不可信任的地方，它每天杜撰新近增加了多少万中国军队的故事来解释美国的失败”。
