Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 10th. The mass railway protection network with militiamen as the core along the Beijing-Baotou Railway has effectively guaranteed the safety of railway traffic. By the end of 1950, all villages within five miles on both sides of the Beijing-Baotou Railway had established village railway protection committees or railway protection station organizations. More than 39,000 militiamen and young and middle-aged farmers regularly participated in railway protection. Many villages voluntarily signed railway protection contracts with relevant sections and stations, taking responsibility for sections. They recorded the number of sleepers, rails, rail spikes, etc. in their managed sections in the contract, ensuring that not a single item was lost. Many villages also implemented joint defense, assisting each other whenever a situation was discovered.

Villages along the Beijing-Baotou Railway began to establish railway protection organizations successively from July 1949. Over the past year, these railway protection organizations have assisted railway public security personnel in guarding the people's railway and have achieved great results. Since last April, there has not been a single incident on the entire line that affected traffic due to sabotage by bandits and special agents or theft of railway materials. During the flood season from May to September the year before last, farmers in flood-stricken areas organized temporary rescue teams to repair damages as they occurred, never delaying transportation. In the 104-li railway line within the territory of Huailai County, Chahar Province, there have been no accidents for eighteen months.

In the struggle of railway protection farmers to prevent sabotage by special agents, there have been many moving stories. For example, one night in September last year, militiamen patrolling the line discovered three bandits attempting to blow up Bridge No. 101 on the line. He immediately gathered more than 40 militiamen and young and middle-aged farmers from nearby villages to capture them without making a sound. The bandits were discovered and fled, but people finally chased them three or four li away and captured them. On the night of July 27 last year, it was raining heavily, and special agents placed five three-meter square boulders on the railway under a high mountain east of Fengzhen Station, attempting to derail the train. When railway protection farmers Zhang Jincai and Zhang Wawa discovered it, the train had already departed from Fengzhen and would arrive in just over ten minutes. The place was right at a large curve, and the mountain blocked the view ahead, making it impossible for the crew to see the obstacles on the road. In such a critical situation, Zhang Jincai shouted loudly and ran forward to stop the train, eventually stopping the train one and a half kilometers away from the boulders. At the same time, another farmer, Zhang Wawa, found railway workers nearby and summoned more than 30 local residents to quickly remove the stones, ensuring the safety of the train and maintaining its schedule. Afterwards, the perpetrators of the case were quickly apprehended with the assistance of Zhang Jincai and others. Currently, the phenomena of bandit and special agent sabotage and theft on the road have been significantly reduced compared to before, and they are all discovered in a timely manner, ensuring traffic safety.

Recently, a heated railway protection patriotic competition has been launched between villages along the Beijing-Baotou Railway.

### 京包路沿线群众建立护路网  保障人民铁路行车安全

　　京包路沿线群众建立护路网
    保障人民铁路行车安全
    【新华社张家口十日电】京包铁路沿线以民兵为核心的群众性护路网，有力地保障了铁路行车的安全。至一九五○年底止，京包铁路两侧五里以内村庄全部建立了村护路委员会或护路站的组织。经常参加护路的民兵、青壮年农民达三万九千多人。许多村自动和铁路的有关段、站订立了护路合同，分段负责。他们把所管段内共有多少道木、钢轨、道钉等数字均记在合同里，保证不丢失一件。许多村并实行联防，只要发现情况就随时相互协助。
    京包铁路沿线各村自一九四九年七月即陆续建立护路组织。一年多来这些护路组织协助铁路公安人员警卫着人民的铁路，成绩甚大。全线自去年四月以来，已做到没有一次因匪特破坏、盗窃铁路器材等原因而影响行车。前年五至九月洪汛期间，水患地区各村农民更组织临时抢险队，随坏随修，从没有延误运输，察省怀来县境内的一百零四华里的铁路线，已有十八个月未发生任何事故。
    在护路农民防止特务破坏的斗争中，曾经有过许多动人的故事。如去年九月的一个夜晚，查路民兵发觉三个匪徒正企图爆炸该路的一○一号铁桥，他立刻不张声息地集合附近村庄的民兵、青壮年农民等四十余人来捕捉。匪徒发觉逃遁，但人们终于追至三四里路外，把他们捉住。去年七月二十七日夜里，下着大雨，特务在丰镇站东一座高山下的铁道上搁置了五块三米见方的巨石，企图颠覆列车。当护路农民张进才、张五娃发觉时，列车已自丰镇开出，再隔十来分钟就到。该处正当一个大弯道，大山挡住前方视线，乘务员不可能看见路上障碍。在这样危急的情况下，张进才就高声呼号，向前飞跑阻止列车行进，结果使列车在距巨石一公里半处停住。另一农民张五娃在同时找到附近的铁路出勤工人，并召来当地居民三十余人，迅速把石头抬开，使这次列车得到安全并仍然正点运行。事后，该案凶犯又经张进才等协助侦察而很快缉获。目前该路匪特破坏及偷盗现象较前均已显著减少，并均被及时发觉，保障了行车安全。
    最近，京包沿线村与村之间更热烈地展开了护路爱国竞赛。
