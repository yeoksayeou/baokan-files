　　My Ideological Transformation
　　Yu Songru, Director of the Power Department of Tianjin No. 1 Textile Factory, National Model Worker Representative
　　I am a technician. I worked for a long time in the old society. At that time, I always thought I made a living by my skills; I considered myself aloof and looked down on my colleagues, and even more so on the workers. After liberation, although I knew that the new China led by the Communist Party was good, I still had a muddled mind and used my old perspective to view the new society. For example, I saw that the workers had all stood up, but the treatment of technicians was sometimes not as high as before; I saw that some people were not as skilled as myself, but their salaries were higher than mine, and so on. Whenever these things conflicted with my personal interests, I was dissatisfied. But after continuous political study, the help of others, and self-struggle between new and old ideas, I gradually shed my old baggage and realized that after liberation, my technical conservatism and my inability to take the initiative in my work, fearing responsibility for doing things wrong, were completely wrong. I realized that I must use the spirit of democratic management to inspire the creativity of the workers.
　　With ideological awakening, my work attitude has greatly changed. When I saw that the boiler structure of Tianjin No. 1 Textile Factory was improper and the turbine blades were severely corroded, I repeatedly suggested to the administration that we should carry out the modification and overhaul ourselves. After the leadership approved, I mobilized the masses to study together. Facts have proved that the broad masses possess infinite wisdom. In the work, the creative talents of the masses are constantly demonstrated. When the turbine blades were first removed, seeing their strange shapes, many felt it impossible to make them. After everyone's research, it was discovered that the inner arc was one-third of a circle, the outer convex back was a forty-five-degree circle, and the two sides of the back were straight lines with the same slope. This led to further research and development of special tools for making blades. For example, when welding the steam port with nickel-chromium steel, because of the special steel quality, it initially cracked as soon as it was welded. Later, after research, the problem was finally solved by using a neutral flame and repeatedly welding on both sides. This fully proves that by relying on the masses and combining theory with practice, there are no difficulties that cannot be overcome. In my work, I extensively infused what I knew about theory into the workers. At the same time, I learned from the actual work of the workers and supplemented the shortcomings of theory at any time. This further encouraged my work courage. After launching the overhaul of No. 2 turbine at Tianjin No. 1 Textile Factory, I took the opportunity of the Tianjin Boiler Professional Conference to provide improvement suggestions and publicize the importance of combining theory with practice and following the mass line to the technical personnel. Over the past year, the more significant achievements in Tianjin have been: Tianjin No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3 Textile Factories saved an average of four to five thousand tons of coal for power generation throughout 1950 compared to last year; after the original power department of Tianjin No. 1 Textile Factory studied and manufactured turbine blade tools, it improved the creativity of the workers. In the past year, more than 20 kinds of technical improvements and tool creations were made. For example, Zhai Bingshun created tools for making cotton sliver tubes, and Wang Wenjun created tools for making exhaust fans, increasing work efficiency by three to more than twenty times. Fan Ruilin, an electrical technician at No. 1 Factory, changed from his past departmentalism and took the initiative to help repair the electrical equipment of No. 6 Factory, saving No. 6 Factory seven large and small transformers and saving more than 36,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity per month. In the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend our country, our technicians should redouble our efforts in production to build a strong economic and national defense force. In Tianjin, we have launched a patriotic competition movement for technicians to combine theory with practice. This movement is just beginning to unfold, and I hope to develop it throughout the country.

　　我的思想转变
    天津中纺一厂动力部主任  全国工业劳动模范代表  于松如
    我是一个技术人员。在旧社会工作了很久。在那时，总以为自己是靠技术吃饭；自己清高自居，看不起同事，更看不起工人。解放以后，虽然知道共产党领导的新中国是好的，但因为还带着满脑子的糊涂思想，自己用旧眼光来看新社会，如看到工友们都翻身了，但技术人员的待遇有的却不如从前高了；看到有的人技术上不如自己，但薪金却比自己拿的多等等。遇到这些和个人利益有冲突的地方，自己就不满意。但经过不断地政治学习，别人的帮助，和新旧思想的自我斗争，逐渐摆脱了旧的包袱，觉悟到，解放以后自己技术保守，不能主动地进行工作，怕做坏了负责任的思想是完全错误的。认识到自己必须运用民主管理的精神，启发工人群众的创造性。
    思想有了觉悟，工作态度就大为不同了。当我看到中纺一厂锅炉构造欠妥善，透平机汽口叶片已腐坏不堪的时候，就再三向行政上建议，要自行改装检修。上级批准后，就发动群众共同研究。事实证明，广大群众潜蓄着无穷的智慧。在工作中，不断地表现出群众的创造才能。当透平机的叶片刚拆下的时候，看到形状奇异，多感无法制做。经大家研究，就发现内面弧形是三分之一的圆，外面的凸背是四十五度的圆，背面两侧是斜度相同的直线。这样就进一步研究出制做叶片的特种工具来。又如，用镍铬钢焊接汽口时，因钢质特殊，起初随焊随裂，后来经过研究，用中性焰两面反复焊接法终于成功。这都充分证明了依靠群众、理论与实际结合，就没有克服不了的困难。在工作中，把我所知道的理论广泛地灌注到工友群众中去。一面又从工友的实际工作中吸取经验，随时补充理论的不足。这样一来更鼓起了我的工作勇气。在发动检修中纺一厂二号透平机之后，我就借天津市锅炉专业会议的机会，提供改进意见，向技术人员宣传理论与实际结合和走群众路线的重要。经过一年来的时间，在天津市较为显著的收获是：中纺一、二、三三个厂一九五零年全年发电用煤较去年平均各节省了四、五千吨；中纺一厂原动部修机间，自研究制造透平机叶片工具后，提高了工友们的创造性，一年来技术改进和创造工具二十余种。如翟炳顺创造制棉条筒工具，王文鋆创造制排气风扇工具等，提高工作效率三倍至二十余倍。一厂电气技师范瑞琳，由过去本位主义思想，一变而主动要求帮助检修六厂电气设备，不但给六厂节省下大小变压器七个，并且每月可节省电力三万六千余度。在抗美援朝保家卫国运动中，我们技术人员更应加倍努力生产，以建设起强大的经济力量和国防力量。在天津市，我们发动了技术人员进行理论与实际结合的爱国竞赛运动。这一运动方在初步展开，我希望能把它发展到全国去。
