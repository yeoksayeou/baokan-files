The entire staff of the Capital Power Plant:

We guarantee the safe power supply of the capital.

Respectful Chairman Mao,

As you lead us in victoriously passing through 1950, and a new 1951 is about to begin, continuing to achieve even greater victories under your leadership, we, representing all the staff of the Capital Power Plant, extend to you our most sublime respect. We also report to you the good news of our plant's production over the past year.

Originally, the machinery and equipment of the Shijingshan Power Plant were of varying types and complexities. In the words of our workers, it was like "three generations of machines living together." Coupled with lax management in the past, even slight carelessness would cause problems with the machines, often causing the city's lights to flicker, on and off every few days. However, since last year, with the gradual improvement of the political consciousness of all the plant's staff, everyone has been focused on calculating how to complete the two major tasks assigned to our plant by higher authorities: eliminate accidents and ensure the safe power supply of the capital; rationalize production and reduce electricity generation costs. After a year of continuous efforts, these two tasks have basically been accomplished. Moreover, new achievements have emerged in maximizing the efficiency of machinery and equipment, inspiring the creative wisdom of employees, establishing democratic management systems, and improving employee welfare.

Over the past year, first and foremost, accidents have significantly decreased, now reduced by 80% compared to the beginning of 1950. Since November, there has been a complete elimination of major accidents, ensuring that the Beijing area never experiences power outages. After periodic maintenance of all the plant's machines, the power generation task has increased by 20% compared to 1949. In terms of reducing fixed consumption, we have achieved a coal saving of 3.54% compared to the original coal consumption standard. Labor costs per thousand kilowatt-hours have been reduced by 40% compared to 1949, and the cost reduction has reached 9.52%. Workers submitting rationalization proposals account for 14% of the total number of workers in the plant. The most outstanding achievement is the improvement of the high-pressure furnace, which had been unsolvable for many years, eliminating the emission of coal slag. The coal powder furnace no longer emits black coal powder. The latter alone can save 1.14 million catties of millet per year. In terms of improving production technology, a total of 136 important new records have emerged. According to incomplete statistics, the total value of rationalization proposals and new records achieved by the plant over the past year has increased the country's wealth by 2.9 billion yuan.

In addition, a series of new management systems have been established. In the past, the organization was large and bloated, with leadership systems overlapping up to seven levels, and handling one matter required a complex process of twelve procedures. Now, we have learned from the Soviet enterprise management methods and implemented a branch factory responsibility system, where the plant director can directly command workshops and personally control production. We have initially implemented quota management, correcting the conservative thinking among workers that "boiler operation cannot reach the quota" and "who is responsible if a boiler explodes due to excessive pressure." The factory management committee has been established and signed a plant-wide collective, linked contract in June, formulating plant-wide labor discipline and reward measures. Workers have also voluntarily established a shift handover inspection and signature system, and motor insulation resistance must be tested before starting the machine. Instances of being late or leaving early have decreased by 47.5%. The plant has trained and promoted 72 cadres above the rank of team leader and emerged 37 labor models in production.

In terms of employee labor protection and welfare, 186 new worker dormitories have been built, and 172 dilapidated dormitories have been repaired, basically changing the situation where five or six people were crowded into one room in the past. Medical equipment worth more than 50 million yuan has been expanded, and the plant's environmental sanitation has been completely renewed. Factory employees have formal technical training and a cultural school with more than 600 students. Reasonable supply of furnace clothing, masks, gloves, and glasses for production has been achieved.

Respectful Chairman Mao! Water has its source, and trees have their roots. We clearly understand that all of this is because of your wise leadership. You have taught us to rely closely on the Party, rely on the masses, rely on the construction experience of Soviet experts, and correctly unite with technical personnel. The achievements of the past year have been obtained on this basis.

Today, as we are striving to build a beautiful future, American imperialism dreams of dragging us back to the inhuman days of the past. Respectful Chairman Mao! The Chinese people, who have stood up under your leadership, know how to resist these beasts. We, representing all the plant's staff, guarantee to you that in the new year, our plant will strengthen scientific management, enrich various inspection and statistical systems, and implement personnel quotas and chart-guided production systems. We will further reduce fixed consumption and have the confidence and strength to ensure the safe power supply of the capital. And with this, we will support the People's Volunteer Army and celebrate the victorious start of 1951. Finally, we sincerely wish you good health.

The entire staff of the Shenyang No. 3 Machine Factory:

Last year, production increased by 61% and many external processing tasks were completed ahead of schedule.

Respectful Chairman Mao,

The production achievements we are now reporting to you are a great step forward compared to 1949. In terms of quantity, production in 1950 increased by 61% compared to 1949 (not including new tasks accounting for 20% of the year's working hours); in terms of quality, from initial assembly to the establishment of an inspection system, from unqualified to qualified, fourth-grade products were eliminated in the third quarter, and third-grade products were eliminated in the fourth quarter, fully meeting the standards of second-grade products or above.

More importantly, we can report to you that in this movement to resist American aggression and aid Korea and defend our homes and country, our factory has launched a production competition movement and model workshops have emerged. Our wages were originally based on an eight-grade system from June, from exceeding the quota to being fully converted to piecework; but when this task came, we didn't even need piecework, working day and night to complete a month's task eight days ahead of schedule, and also making technical improvements, reducing two welding steps. These external processing tasks were not done with overtime, but were done in addition to the annual tasks, that is, by using a crash production method to complete the tasks.

Our factory has trained 80% of young workers who can specialize in one product. Old workers have been promoted to technicians, site directors, section chiefs, department heads, secretaries, factory directors, union chairmen or production ministers, party branch secretaries or deputy general branch secretaries, and a large number of production models have emerged. At the same time, a large number of workers participate in cultural and recreational activities, such as staging plays, drawing cartoons, writing communications for newspapers, and forming a workers' band.

In 1950, in addition to building a spacious assembly area, the factory also built a new forging room. Except for the sand casting yard, all the roofs were renovated. To improve the welfare of all the plant's staff, 32 new labor model buildings were built for model producers to live in, and a separate bathhouse was built for them; a single dormitory for 500 people was built, which not only has heating but also running water and bathhouses. This is something our workers have never dreamed of. In the past, such a four-story building that could accommodate 500 people, workers could go in to work during construction and go in to put out fires, but when people lived there, they couldn't even go in to see it. But today, we live in it. Our canteens also have heating and are equipped with a large loudspeaker, so we can listen to reports and other radio programs when we are off work and resting.

We have victoriously completed this year's production tasks ahead of schedule and are prepared for next year's large-scale production. We are here to report to you. We guarantee that we will work hard to complete the glorious task of building an industrial base. We respectfully wish you good health in the new year!

The entire staff of the Harbin Electric Power Bureau:

We are determined to strive for not a minute of power outage as a New Year's gift to you.

Respectful Chairman Mao,

The entire staff of our Harbin Electric Power Bureau and Power Plant, under your wise leadership, are living an increasingly prosperous life and carrying forward the glorious tradition of the old hero Liu Yingyuan. In 1950, after the "Anti-Accident Struggle Month," the "Red Flag Competition," and this "Patriotic Labor Competition," from top to bottom, from workers to technicians and staff, we have given full play to our initiative and creativity and improved our work. This year's production task was victoriously exceeded by 5% at the end of November. In the last month, after the victorious news of the great victory on the Korean battlefield and the liberation of Pyongyang came, everyone, whether in the workshop, on site, next to the machine, or in the office; whether it was an old worker, a young man, or a woman, redoubled their efforts. According to statistics in December, the production task has been exceeded by 14.76%, accidents have been reduced by 5.5% compared to last year, power outage losses have been reduced by 56% compared to last year, and the total cost has been reduced by 14.16%. In one year, 456 production advanced workers have emerged. Now we have put forward the slogan of "Striving for not a minute of power outage" to welcome 1951 as a New Year's gift to you!

Wishing you good health,

The entire staff of the Harbin Electric Power Bureau

The entire staff of the Fushun Mining Bureau Electrical Machinery Factory:

Having completed the task of producing 25 kinds of products, we will continue to launch a patriotic production competition.

Respectful Chairman Mao,

We congratulate you on the New Year with great excitement and joy, and report to you our victory on the production front. In the year after the birth of New China, thanks to your wise leadership and that of the Central People's Government, we have brought into play the working class's high enthusiasm for labor and completed the glorious task assigned to us by the state of producing 25 kinds of products, several of which had never been manufactured in old China; and completed 113% of the annual task of producing the main mechanical and electrical repair raw materials for the bureau, more than double that of 1949, and more than 5.6% higher than the highest output in 1943 under the puppet Manchukuo regime. The quality of products has also been improving month by month. The quality of cast steel alone has increased by 22.3% compared to the highest level under the puppet Manchukuo regime, and safe production has been basically guaranteed. Although we have achieved these achievements, we will never be complacent or arrogant, and will launch a patriotic production competition with renewed efforts. We will improve management and strengthen current affairs studies to welcome the glorious tasks of 1951. We sincerely wish you health.

The entire staff of the Taiyuan Cement Plant:

Having completed the annual task more than a month ahead of schedule, the quality and compressive strength of the cement have been improved.

Chairman Mao,

Under your wise leadership, the Chinese people finally defeated Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang bandits and achieved a national victory, turning us from slaves into masters. In the first year after the founding of the People's Republic, the entire staff of our cement plant carried out the democratization of factory management and the business operation of the enterprise. We launched a patriotic competition. Now we will report these achievements to you as a New Year's gift.

Since the autumn competition in 1950 and this patriotic competition, the output of our plant has increased from more than four tons to more than six tons every ten hours, and we completed the annual production task ahead of schedule on November 19. By the end of the year, we had exceeded the task by 23%. In terms of quality, the standard quota for cement residue is below 7%, and we have achieved below 5% in both autumn and winter. The compressive strength of cement has been increased from an average of 551 kg to 687 kg.

93% of the staff in our plant have joined the trade union, and more than 80% of the staff have participated in spare-time studies of theory, politics, culture, and technology, and have achieved great results. The old worker Luo Desheng, who was illiterate in the past, has learned more than 500 characters and can write simple letters after five or six months of study.

In the past, we ate bran and soybean cakes, but now we eat millet or white flour, and our lives are guaranteed. We have also established large canteens, barber shops, bathhouses, medical clinics, and dormitories. In the past, no one cared about these.

Some of our factory workers have been rated as first-class labor models in the province, and some have been rated as outstanding learning models in Taiyuan City. The worker Zhao Shuangcheng was recently elected as an alternate member of the Second Executive Committee of the Taiyuan City Federation of Trade Unions and participated in the work of the leading organ. All of this makes us unspeakably happy and deeply feel that we are the masters of the country and that the working class is the leading class of the revolution. These achievements and happiness can only be obtained under your wise leadership. Therefore, when we celebrate the New Year, we think of you, the People's Government, and the People's Liberation Army. The entire staff of our plant has launched a New Year's campaign to support the government and cherish the people. Every employee will make a condolence bag and buy all kinds of comfort items, and our families will also participate in this movement with joy and enthusiasm. Chairman Mao: Now we are brewing the production plan and collective contract for 1951 to strengthen the power to resist American aggression and aid Korea and defend our homes and country, and to welcome the great construction tasks of 1951.

Wishing you health in the New Year,

Respectfully from the entire staff of the Taiyuan Cement Plant

Liu Qingxiang, representative of Shandong attending the National Labor Model Conference:

Determined to continue to improve the pair-plate polishing machine, we also want to create a tube-rolling machine.

Respectful Chairman Mao,

1950 has passed. In this year, under your and the Party's correct leadership, I have made obvious progress in both ideological awareness and production, which has made me truly realize that the factory is the workers' own home, so I think about work and add energy to production everywhere. Before September, our Jinan Industrial Bureau No. 2 Factory had a lot of rework and waste every month due to lax management and strict systems, causing great losses to national resources. Later, under the call of the factory's Party general branch, a mass movement to oppose rework and waste was launched, followed by a vigorous patriotic production competition movement to resist American aggression and aid Korea in various workshops and groups. Not only has the phenomenon of rework and waste been basically eliminated, but also model deeds of saving raw materials and utilizing waste have emerged continuously. After I returned to the factory from the National Labor Model Conference in Beijing, what you told us: "Labor models should play three major roles in production: leading, backbone, and bridge." I completely remember it in my heart and did a wide range of publicity, which influenced all the factory workers and brothers to feel the glory of labor models, and they all devoted themselves to research and strive to be models in production. In three months, 35 workers improved 20 kinds of tools, which played a great role in completing the winter production tasks. In the November patriotic production competition award evaluation, 278 people, accounting for 35% of the total number of factory employees, received awards. Currently, the workers' enthusiasm for production is even higher, and they are all striving to be labor models at the provincial labor model conference in the spring of 1951.

In this year, with the encouragement of the factory leaders and the help of the workers, I created a pair-plate polishing machine. I feel that I have not done enough for the country and the people. I am determined to continue to improve the pair-plate polishing machine in 1951 in conjunction with technical personnel, and it is estimated that the output will increase three times compared to the past. At the same time, I am also preparing to create a tube-rolling machine to replace the phenomenon of wasting manpower and substandard tubes when manually rolling tubes for water wheels. The drawings of this tube-rolling machine were completely drawn by me using my spare time. I would like to guarantee to you: The improvement and creation of these machines will definitely be successful in 1951. I believe: Only the working class under the leadership of the Communist Party can truly give play to great wisdom and creativity. And I am also determined to strengthen the study of political theory, learn the knowledge of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, be an excellent worker, and always maintain the honor of a labor model. I respectfully wish you good health.

Luo Shufang, representative of Shandong attending the National Labor Model Conference:

I can operate five looms alone, and I will strive to exceed the current record this year.

Respectful Chairman Mao,

It's the New Year, and I want to write you a letter. At night (I'm on the night shift), I'm thinking by the loom: What should I write to tell you? You probably know everything: know how we workers are carrying out the patriotic production competition; know that our weaving workers want to resist American aggression and aid Korea and defend our homes and country with the practical action of "weaving more cloth and producing less defective cloth"; you probably also know what we are thinking in our hearts. However, I still have to tell you: What we are thinking in our hearts is: The past achievements are not enough. In 1951, we will work harder, work hard for ourselves, work hard for the motherland, and work hard for you, for our great leader Chairman Mao.

I'll tell you again, Chairman Mao, I can operate five looms alone—there are five of us workers in the whole factory who can operate five looms. In the past, the quantity and quality of the cloth I wove was the best in the factory; that's why I was able to attend the Beijing National Labor Model Conference, and that's why I was able to see—something I never dreamed of—you, the great Chairman Mao.

After I came back from Beijing, I participated in the Jinan City Second Workers' Congress, and I was elected as a member of the Jinan City Federation of Trade Unions Executive Committee. I am very happy. In the old society, we workers could not handle our own affairs, but now we can. I will definitely fulfill my responsibility and work hard for the benefit of our workers.

After I came back from Beijing, because I often attended meetings, it took up a lot of time and energy, and the results were not good enough. Some workers have caught up with me, and I am very anxious. Later, I thought about it, I want to work hard to maintain my achievements, and try to exceed the current record in 1950; at the same time, I want to enable many workers to catch up with me and surpass me. I told them that being a model is not a difficult thing, and everyone has the possibility of becoming a model; really, they are working hard and striving to be models.

The workers in our factory, Qiu Xiuying, Pang Xiaoben, Ji Chenghua, and Zhao Hongjun, can all watch five looms like me, and their results have all reached my level. Now, take the average number from December 11th to 16th, 1951 as an example to illustrate: Qiu Xiuying averages 43.2 yards of cloth per loom per day, Pang Xiaoben 43.3 yards, Ji Chenghua 43.1 yards, I am 43.2 yards, and Zhao Hongjun 42.8 yards. None of us have produced any defective cloth.

Chairman Mao, in 1951, I will continue to work hard to enable many workers in the factory to watch five looms, and to make the work results reach the same level as ours.

Under your leadership—the soldiers on the front line are fighting bravely, and the workers across the country are working hard to produce, and the American aggressors will definitely be defeated by us!

Respectfully wishing you a victorious New Year

Song Luoxue, agricultural labor model from Mancheng, Hebei:

I guarantee that the production volume will increase again next year and lead the masses of the whole village to organize.

Dear Chairman Mao,

On the eve of New Year's Day in 1951, I will report to you on the implementation of my production plan this year. I believe you will be very happy. Although this year has experienced floods and insect plagues, and although some individual items in my production plan have not been completed; but in general, this year's planned production has not only been completed, but also exceeded.

My family has a total of six people, me, my wife, and four children, the eldest child is eighteen years old. The whole family has a total of three laborers, and a total of 22.6 mu of land is cultivated. This spring, in response to the Party and the government's plan to increase cotton and grain production, I first convened a family meeting to determine that 6 mu of Erbishizi cotton, 2 mu of foreign yam, 1 mu of peanut, 4 mu of millet, 6 mu of wheat, and 3 mu of corn should be planted. In addition, the remaining 0.6 mu of land was planted with vegetables. This production plan was later not changed except that the foreign yam was increased by half a mu compared to the original plan, and the peanut was reduced by half a mu.

The plan has been determined. In order to ensure the completion and exceeding of the production plan, I paid attention to the two most important keys of diligent cultivation and more fertilization. Therefore, I cultivated all the land three times and harrowed it four times. And in order to apply more fertilizer, I participated in the village's wood factory to work and used the money earned to buy soybean cake and raise two pigs, so that this year's fertilizer accumulation reached more than 160 carts. The detailed situation is as follows: 6 mu of cotton, an average of 5.5 carts of fertilizer per mu (usually 4 or 5 carts), and 50 catties of sesame cake; hoed seven times (more than twice the usual); pruned three times. However, aphids and fire spiders occurred in May and July this year, causing cotton production to decrease. The average yield per mu was 100 catties, a decrease of 60 catties per mu compared to the original plan. The 4 mu of millet was a bumper harvest. I selected the fertile No. 4 drought-resistant millet seeds last year, and this year an average of 7 large carts of fertilizer were applied per mu, and 30 catties of cottonseed kernel cake and 2 loads of manure (50 catties per load) were used per mu during planting; hoed four times. This year, the millet ears were long and fat, and although they suffered a little flood, each mu also produced 1 shi and 7 dou, an increase of 91 catties compared to the usual year. The yield of yam was surprising. This is the yam variety that I brought back for promotion after visiting the provincial farm this spring. Our whole village planted this kind of yam. The yam I planted applied 13 carts of fertilizer per mu and yielded 3,000 catties per mu, more than double the usual yield. The 3 mu of corn averaged 1 shi and 3 dou per mu. The 6 mu of wheat yielded 9 dou per mu. Half a mu of peanut also yielded 200 catties.

The total harvest of my production this year exceeded the original plan. It is estimated that it can be exchanged for 5,620 catties of millet, an increase of 2,235 catties compared to the usual yield of 3,385 catties. It exceeds the increase production plan for this year (the original plan was to increase by more than 1,580 catties) by 650 catties. If there were no insect pests and floods this year, I believe the increased quantity would be much greater.

In the past year, I have experienced in production that only by organizing can labor efficiency and production volume be improved. This spring, I participated in the provincial economic conference and listened to Chairman Yang Xiufeng's report on the benefits of organizing. After returning home, I immediately publicized it to all Party members at the Party branch meeting; and mobilized 16 households to form 4 work allocation teams. My team has 4 households, with a total of 76 mu of land, 6 male laborers, 4 female laborers, and 2 donkeys. In the work of pulling soil to send blanks, plowing, pulling wheat, and pulling wheat, 20 workers were saved. When pulling wheat, the 4 families had a total of 31 mu of wheat fields, and 4 people finished pulling in two days; which is equivalent to 4 mu pulled per person per day. If done individually, each person can only pull 3 mu per day, saving 2 workers per day. This fact made the masses realize the benefits of organizing. During the wheat pulling period this year, 223 households out of the 234 households in the whole village were encouraged to participate in labor mutual aid, laying a preliminary foundation for the development and improvement of mutual aid groups in the future.

In production, I also paid attention to mastering agricultural technology and studying the characteristics of crops. For example, the characteristic of Erbishizi cotton is that the branches and leaves are sparse and extend in all directions, occupying a large area, and it is advisable to leave seedlings sparsely. Therefore, when sowing cotton seeds, I paid attention to building large ridges, with a row spacing of about 1.8 to 2.2 feet (usually only 1.2 feet), and a plant spacing of about 1.5 to 1.8 feet (usually 1.2 to 3 feet), so that the cotton is ventilated and grows large and fertile branches. In the cotton fields south of the village, which were less affected by the disaster, each plant averaged 12 large peaches, and 120 catties of seed cotton were picked per mu. However, the cotton fields of Luo Deshun next door, he planted small ridges and crowded rows, which were not ventilated, and the plants grew weakly, with only 7 or 8 small peaches per plant, and the yield was reduced. From the actual planting of cotton, I also found that soybeans should not be planted next to the ridges of cotton fields, because the fire spiders on the soybeans are very easy to spread to the cotton. This year I have suffered because of not having enough experience, and I will learn this lesson next year.

In order to increase agricultural production, I and the masses of the whole village attached great importance to seed selection. This year, the superiors determined that our village is a good cotton experimental area. We organized a cotton technology group to lead the masses of the whole village to inspect and select the Erbishizi cotton seeds returned from the provincial farm, and granulated 6,000 catties of cotton seeds before Guyu this year. Therefore, the quality of cotton this year is better than in previous years. In order to ensure that all high-quality cotton seeds will be planted next year, I also led the whole village to carry out field selection, so as to achieve separate harvesting, separate drying, and separate ginning to ensure seed purity. This spring, in order to promote foreign yam, I and the village cadres cultivated more than 400,000 seedlings and promoted them to the whole village. As a result, the yield increased by one time compared to local yam, and the masses praised it.

I am currently drafting the production plan for next year. I guarantee that next year's production volume will increase more than this year. I will also lead the whole village to organize and strive to rapidly increase production.

With respect,

Song Luoxue, labor model of Songjia Village, Mancheng

Li Ming, a militia hero from Chahar:

The militiamen in the village are all eager to try and prepare to severely hit the American robbers.

Dear Chairman Mao,

I am Li Ming from Baicaowa Village, Yanqing County, Chahar Province. Since returning from attending the National Combat Heroes Conference, I have often been thinking about what you told us: Unite with the broad masses of people and continue to make outstanding contributions to the country. Now I will report to you the recent situation in our village:

This year, our village is a disaster village, but all the villagers still victoriously completed the three autumn harvests. During the autumn harvest, the militiamen actively protected the autumn harvest and did not allow a grain of food to be stolen. After the harvest, the autumn plowing of 1,746 mu of land in the whole village was 100% completed. At the same time, all 73 households in the village actively responded to the government's call for autumn selection and tree planting, selected and planted 11,250 trees; and borrowed 100 catties of mountain apricot seeds from the government and planted 72 mu of apricot trees on the nearby barren mountains.

After harvesting in the autumn, the villagers in our village switched to sideline production non-stop. Since the beginning of October, 25 to 6 people have been going to the mountains every day to chop firewood and carry wood. In the past two months, they have earned 26 shi of millet, which is enough for the whole village to live through the winter. In the process of chopping firewood and carrying wood, heroes have also emerged in our village. For example, Yan Changyou carries 210 to 20 catties every trip, which can earn 1 dou and 2 sheng of rice, which is a great encouragement to everyone.

The location of our village is very remote and the transportation is inconvenient, and we are often exploited by speculators. Now that cooperatives have been established throughout our county, the people in our village have become members of the cooperatives. The cooperatives not only purchase local products at high prices, but also supply our necessities at low prices. Everyone says, "Like this, how much less loss will be calculated in a year!"

After the autumn plowing, the government took care of our village this year and exempted us from the public grain due to the disaster. However, almost all of the 5,656 catties of livestock, seeds, and various grains borrowed from the agricultural loan in our village this year have been repaid. Because we understand that agricultural loans are the government's support for the people to restore and develop production, we can repay them this year for future use. I am working hard to help the Yanqing branch of the People's Bank of China collect agricultural loans, hoping that the whole village will repay them as soon as possible.

While working hard in production, we have not forgotten the cultural and educational work in the village.

This year, our village established a primary school, and 20 of the 25 children in the village have been enrolled. However, when I think of the pain of not being able to sign my name when I was in Beijing for a meeting, I am always thinking about the few children who have not gone to school. Whenever I have time, I go to each family to explain to the parents the benefits of literacy. Now their thoughts are slowly getting through, and they all say that they will send all the children to school soon.

Since returning from Beijing, I have spoken to whoever I visit about the friendship between the Soviet people and the Chinese people. I try my best to tell everyone about the life, culture, and economy of the Soviet people. After everyone listened, they all said they would learn from the Soviet people. Wang Huaiming, Chen Yongshun, and other 17 people in our village have become members of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association.

Dear Chairman Mao: Just as our long-awaited happy life is approaching, the American imperialists are frantically invading Korea and our country. Our village has organized a "newspaper reading group." Whenever we read about the American imperialists' bloody massacre of the Korean people and bombing of our Northeast compatriots, everyone's hearts are like a raging fire. At this time, I can't help but think of the past when the whole family ate chaff and vegetables, think of the pain of working as a long-term worker for thirteen years, and think of the looting of the Japanese "three-all policy". On this day when I have turned over and stood up, the American imperialists are going to seize our fruits of victory again. Can I sit idly by at home?

Dear Chairman Mao: The 18 militiamen in our village, in addition to carrying wood during the day, practice laying mines, removing mines, and aiming at night, and they are now proficient. Everyone is eager to try and go to Korea together to severely attack the American robbers with our explosion experience.

Salute!

Militia Hero Li Ming (written by Wang Shaoguang from the Chahar South Bank Office)

    本来，石景山发电厂机器设备种类参差复杂，用咱工人的话来说是“机器老少三辈子在一起过日子”。再加上过去管理制度不严密，稍一马虎机器就出漏子，经常使城里的电灯三天明二天灭。但是，打从去年起，全厂职工由于政治觉悟的逐步提高，大伙一心在算计着怎样来完成上级交给我们厂的两大任务：消灭事故，保证首都的安全供电；生产合理化，减低发电成本。经过一年来的不断努力，现在两项任务已经基本上办到了。并且在发挥机器设备效能、启发职工的创造发明智慧、建立民主管理制度和提高职工福利等方面，都一一出现了崭新的成绩。
    一年来，首先是事故显著减少了，现在已经较一九五○年初减少百分之八十。十一月份起并且完全消灭了重要事故，保证了北京地区的永不停电。全厂机器经过定期检修后，发电任务较一九四九年增加百分之二十。减低定额消耗方面做到较原定煤耗标准省煤百分之三点五四。每千度电较一九四九年减少人工百分之四十，成本减低达到百分之九点五二。提出合理化建议的工人占全厂工人总数百分之十四。成绩最突出的为改进了多年来没法解决的高压炉，使不再冒煤渣子；煤粉炉不再冒黑煤粉。仅后者一年便可节省一百一十四万斤小米。在生产技术提高上，共出现一三六件重要新纪录。全厂一年来合理化建议和新纪录的收获，据不完全统计，已给国家增加了二十九亿元财富。
    此外又建立一系列新的管理制度，过去机构庞大臃肿，领导系统上下重叠达七级，办一件事要经过繁复的十二道手续。现在学习了苏联的企业管理方法，实行分场负责制，厂长可以直接指挥车间，亲自掌握生产。初步推行了定额管理，纠正了工人中“锅炉运转不能达到定额”、“多烧一个汽压锅炉炸飞了谁负责”的保守思想。工厂管理委员会已经成立，并于六月间签订了全厂性的集体、联系合同，制定了全厂性的劳动纪律和奖励办法。工人也自动建立交接班检查签名制度，开机前马达都要试验绝缘抵抗。迟到早退现象减少了百分之四七点五。全厂培养、提拔了领班以上干部七十二名，涌现三十七个生产上的劳动模范。
    职工劳保福利方面，一年来新盖工人宿舍一八六间，修理破旧的宿舍一七二间，基本上改变了过去五、六人挤在一间屋子的情况。扩充了价值五千余万元的医疗设备，全厂环境卫生焕然一新。工厂职工有正规的技术学习，有六百余人的文化学校。有关生产用的炉衣、口罩、手套和眼镜均做到了合理供给。
    敬爱的毛主席！水有源、树有根，我们都清楚地懂得：所有这些都是因为有了你的英明领导。你教育我们紧紧依靠党、依靠群众、依靠苏联专家的建设经验和正确地团结技术人员。一年来的成绩，都是在这一基础上获得的。
    今天，当我们正在奋力建设美好光景的时候，美帝国主义又梦想把咱拉到过去不是人过的日子里。敬爱的毛主席！在你的领导下已经站立起来的中国人民是懂得怎样来抗击这批野兽的。我们代表全厂职工向你保证：在新的一年里，咱厂要做到加强科学管理，充实各种检查、统计制度，贯彻人员定额和图表指样生产制。进一步降低定额消耗，有信心有力量地保证首都的安全供电。并以此来支援人民志愿部队和庆祝一九五一年的胜利开始。最后谨以最诚恳的心情祝你身体健康。

     沈阳第三机器厂全体职工：
    去年增产百分之六十一并突击完成许
        多外加工敬爱的毛主席：
    现在要向你报告的生产成绩比一九四九年已大大的提高了一步。在数量上一九五零年比一九四九年增产百分之六十一外，（另接新任务占全年百分之二十的工时不计在内）；在质量上由装上算起到建立检查制度，从不合格一直到合格，第三季消灭了四级品，第四季消灭了三级品，完全合乎二级品以上的标准。
    更重要的成绩可以向你报告，就是在这次抗美援朝、保家卫国运动中，我厂掀起了生产竞赛运动，并出现了模范车间。我们的工资原来自六月份起实行八级制，由超额到全部改为计件；可是这次任务一来，我们作起活来也不要计件了，日以继夜的一个月任务提前八天完成，而且还进行了技术上的改进，少烧两道熔接火。这些外加工任务，并没有加班加点，都是在不影响全年任务下多干出来的，也就是用突击生产的方式，来完成任务。
    我厂培养了百分之八十的青工，都能专门作一种产品。老工人有提拔为技术员的、现场主任的、股长科长的、秘书的、厂长的、工会主席或生产部长的、党支书记或总支副书记的，涌现了大批的生产模范，同时，大批的工人参加文娱活动。如排剧、画漫画、为报社写通讯，并组成了一个工人音乐队。
    一九五零年厂里除盖了宽阔的装配场外，又新盖了个锻工室，除翻砂场外，所有的房盖都翻修了。为了增进全厂职工的福利，新建了三十二家劳模楼房，给模范生产者们住上，又为他们单修了一个澡塘；修了五百人的独身宿舍，不但有暖气而且有自来水、澡塘等。这是我们工人从来也没有想到的。以前像这样能住五百人的四层大楼，修的时候工人能进去作工，着火的时候工人能进去救火，但有人住的时候连进去看都不能看，可是这个大楼今天叫我们住上了。我们的饭堂也都有暖气，还装了一个大扩音器，下工休息时能听报告和其他广播节目。
    我们胜利的提前完成了今年的生产任务，并准备好了明年的大生产，特在这里向你报告。我们保证一定为完成建设工业基地的光荣任务而努力。敬祝新年身体健康！

     哈尔滨电业局全体职工：
    决争取一分钟也不停电来作为向您新年
        的献礼敬爱的毛主席：
    我们哈尔滨电业局和发电厂，全体职工在您的英明领导下，过着日益上升的生活，并发扬刘英源老英雄的光荣传统，在一九五○年中，经过“反事故斗争月”、“红旗竞赛”和这次的“爱国主义劳动竞赛”。现在由上到下，由工人到技术员、职员，发挥了我们的积极性和创造性，改进了工作。今年的生产任务，在十一月末已胜利的超过了百分之五。最后的一个月中，朝鲜战场的大捷，平壤解放的胜利消息传来以后，无论在车间、现场、机器旁、事务室；无论是老工友、小伙子、妇女都加足了劲；到十二月统计，生产任务已超过百分之十四点七六，事故比去年减少了百分之五点五，停电损失比去年减少百分之五十六，总的成本减低了百分之十四点一六。一年中出现了四五六名生产先进者。现在又提出：“争取一分钟也不停电”的口号以此来迎接一九五一年，来作为向您新年的献礼！
    祝您身体健康

    抚顺矿务局电机工厂全体职工：
    完成了二十五种产品的任务再接
    再厉展开爱国生产竞赛敬爱的毛主席：
    我们以极大的兴奋和欢欣向您祝贺新年，并向您报告我们在生产战线上的胜利。我们在新中国诞生后的一年中，由于您和中央人民政府的英明领导，发挥了工人阶级高度劳动热忱，完成了国家所给予我们的二十五种产品的光荣任务，内有几种是旧中国从来未制造过的产品；并完成本局主要机电修配原料生产的全年任务百分之一百一十三，超过一九四九年一倍以上，更超过伪满一九四三年最高产量百分之五点六。产品质量也逐月提高，仅铸钢的质量较伪满最高水平提高百分之二十二点三，并基本上保证了安全生产。我们虽然获得了这些成就，但我们绝不自骄自傲，更将以再接再厉的精神展开爱国主义生产竞赛。搞好经营管理，加强时事学习。以迎接一九五一年光荣任务。谨祝健康
                                            抚顺矿务局机电厂全体职工
                                            一九五○年十二月二十九日
    太原洋灰厂全体职工：
    提前一月多完成全年任务洋灰质量和耐压
        力都提高毛主席：
    在你的英明领导下，中国人民终于打败了蒋介石和国民党匪帮，得到了全国的胜利，使我们由奴隶变成了主人。我们洋灰厂全体职工在人民共和国成立后的第一个年头，进行了工厂管理民主化，经营企业化的建设。展开爱国主义赛竞。现在我们将这些成绩报告给你，做为新年的献礼。
    俺厂自经过一九五零年秋季竞赛与这次的爱国主义竞赛以来，产量由过去每十时四吨多增加到六吨多，并在十一月十九日提前完成全年生产任务。到年底止，又超额完成任务的百分之二十三。在质量上，洋灰残渣的标准定额是百分之七以下，秋季和冬季我们都做到百分之五以下。洋灰的耐压力，已由平均五百五十一公斤提高到六百八十七公斤。
    我们全厂职工百分之九十三都参加了工会。并有百分之八十以上职工都参加了理论、政治、文化和技术的业余学习，获得很大成绩。原来不识字的老工人骆德生，经过五、六个月的学习，已认识了五百多个字，并能写简单的信。
    过去我们吃的是麸皮豆饼，现在我们吃的是小米或白面，生活得到了保证。我们还建立了大食堂、理发室、澡塘、医疗所和宿舍。这些，过去是没有人管的。
    我们厂有的工友被评为全省的一等劳模，也有的工友被评为全太原市的优等学习模范；工友赵双城最近被选为太原市总工会的二届执行后补委员，参加了领导机关工作。这都使我们说不尽的高兴，深感到我们是国家的主人，工人阶级是革命的领导阶级。这些成绩和幸福，都是在你的英明领导下才能获得的。因此，在过新年的时候，我们就想起了你、人民政府和人民解放军。我们全厂职工展开了年关的拥政劳军热潮。每个职工都要做个慰问袋及购买各式各样的慰劳品，而且我们的家属也欢欣鼓舞的参加了这一运动。毛主席：现在我们正在酝酿订一九五一年的生产计划与集体合同，来加强抗美援朝保家卫国力量、迎接五一年的伟大建设任务。
    祝你新年健康

    山东出席全国劳模会议代表刘庆祥：
    决心继续改进对板精磨机还
    要创造一部卷管子机器敬爱的毛主席：
    一九五○年过去了，这一年我在您和党的正确领导下，不论思想觉悟和生产上都有明显的进步，使我真正认识到工厂是工人自己的家，因而处处为工作着想为生产加劲。我们济南工业局二厂在九月份以前，由于管理松弛制度不严，每月翻工浪费非常多，造成国家资财的很大损失。后在厂党总支的号召下，展开了群众性的反对翻工浪费运动，接着各车间、小组轰烈的开展了抗美援朝爱国主义生产竞赛运动，不仅翻工浪费现象已基本消灭，而且节约原料利用废物的模范事迹不断涌现出来。我从北京开了劳模大会回厂以后，您所告诉我们的：“劳模要在生产中起带头、骨干、桥梁三大作用。”我完全记在心里，并做了广泛的宣传，影响了二厂全体工友兄弟都感到劳模的光荣，都在生产中埋头钻研争取做模范，在三个月中有三十五名工友改进了二十种工具，对完成冬季生产任务上发挥了很大作用，在十一月份爱国生产竞赛的评奖中有二百七十八人占全厂职工总人数的百分之三十五得到奖励，目前工友们的生产热情更为高涨，都争取在一九五一年春全省劳模大会时当劳模。
    我这一年中在厂的领导鼓励与工人帮助下，创造了一部对板精磨机，我感觉对国家、对人民做的还很不够，我决心在一九五一年结合技术人员继续改进对板精磨机，估计产量较前提高三倍。同时我还准备创造一部卷筒机，代替制造水车用手工卷管子的浪费人工和管子的不合规格的现象，这部卷筒机的图样是我完全利用了业余的时间画成的，我愿向您保证：这几部机器的改进和创造在一九五一年一定让它成功。我相信：只有在共产党领导下的工人阶级才能真正发挥伟大的智慧与创造性。并且我还决心加强政治理论的学习，学习马列主义的知识与毛泽东思想，做一个优秀的工人，永远保持劳模的荣誉。敬祝您身体健康

    山东出席全国劳模会议代表骆淑芳：
    我一个人能够开五台织布机
    今年要努力超过现在的纪录敬爱的毛主席：
    过新年了，我想写封信给你，夜间（我是夜班）我在织布机旁心里想：应该写信告诉你什么？大概你什么都知道：知道我们工人怎样开展爱国主义生产竞赛；知道我们织布工人要以“多织布，少出次布”的实际行动来抗美援朝保家卫国；你大概也知道我们心里想的是什么。不过，还得告诉你：我们心里想的是：过去的成绩很不够，一九五一年要更努力工作，努力为自己工作，努力为祖国工作，努力为你，为我们的伟大领袖毛主席工作。
    我再告诉你，毛主席，我一个人能开五台织布机——全厂有我们五个工人能开五台织布机。过去我织的布数量和质量是全厂第一；所以我才能够参加北京全国劳模会议，我才能够看到——作梦也没有想到的事——你，伟大的毛主席。
    我从北京回来后，参加了济市二届工代大会，我当选了济市总工会执行委员，我很高兴，旧社会我们工人不能办自己的事，现在能够了。我一定尽我的责任，努力为我们工人自己的利益而工作。
    我从北京回来后，由于时常开会，占去了很多时间与精力，成绩很不够，有的工人赶上我了，我心里很着急。后来我想开了，我要努力保持我的成绩，一九五○年尽量超过现在的纪录；同时，我还要使很多工人都能赶上我，都能超过我，我告诉他们，当模范不是一件难事，每个人都有可能当模范；真的，他们正努力工作，争取当模范。
    我们厂里的工人邱秀英、庞孝本、纪成华、赵洪俊都和我一样能看五台织布机，他们的成绩都达到了我的水平。现在拿一九五一年十二月十一日到十六日的平均数为例来说明：邱秀英每日每台织布机平均织布四三·二码，庞孝本四三·三码，纪成华四三·一码，我是四三·二码，赵洪俊四二·八码。我们都没有出一点次布。
    毛主席，一九五一年我要继续努力，使全厂能有很多的工人能看五台织布机，而且使工作成绩能够达到像我们一样的水平。
    在你的领导下——前方的将士英勇战斗，全国工人努力生产，美国侵略者一定能被我们打败！
    敬祝新年胜利

    河北满城农业劳模宋洛学：
    我保证明年生产量再增加并领导全村
    群众组织起来亲爱的毛主席：
    我于一九五一年元旦的前夕，给你报告今年我生产计划执行的情况。我相信你一定会非常高兴的。虽然今年经过水灾、虫灾，虽然我的生产计划中有些个别项目没有完成；但总起来说，今年预定的生产计划不但完成了，而且还超过了。
    我家共六口人，我、老婆和四个孩子，大孩子十八岁。全家共有三个劳动力，共种地二十二亩六分。今春为响应党和政府的棉粮增产计划，我首先召开了家庭会议，确定种二比斯字棉六亩，洋山药二亩，花生一亩，谷子四亩，麦子六亩，玉米三亩，此外剩六分地种了蔬菜。这个生产计划后来除洋山药较原计划增种半亩，花生减少半亩外，其他都没有变动。
    计划确定了。为了保证完成并超过生产计划，我就注意到勤耕种多施肥两个最重要的关键。因此，我将全部土地耕三耙四。并为了多施肥，我参加了本村木厂做工，用赚得的钱买豆饼和养两条猪，使今年积肥达到了一百六十车之多。详细的情形是这样：六亩棉花，平均每亩上肥五车半（常年四车或五车），又上麻饼五十斤；锄了七遍（比常年超过两遍）；整枝三遍。但今年五月、七月发生蚜虫和火蜘蛛，使棉花减产。每亩平均产一百市斤，比原计划每亩减少六十斤。四亩谷子是丰收的。我去年选了肥大的四号抗旱谷种，今年平均每亩施肥七大车，耩种时每亩又使用三十斤棉籽仁饼和两挑大粪（每挑五十斤）；锄了四遍。今年谷子的穗头长而肥，虽然受了点涝灾，每亩也产一石七斗，较常年增产九十一斤。山药的产量使人惊奇。这是今春我去省农场参观后带回来推广的山药品种。我们全村都种了这种山药。我种的山药每亩施肥十三车，每亩产了三千斤，较常年产量超过一倍以上。三亩玉米平均每亩产一石三斗。六亩麦子每亩收九斗。半亩花生也产二百斤。
    今年我生产的总收成量是超过原计划的。计可换小米五千六百二十斤，比常年产量三千三百八十五斤增加二千二百三十五斤。超过今年增产计划（原计划增产一千五百八十余斤）六百五十斤。如果没有今年的虫害和涝灾，我相信增产的数量一定会大得多。
    一年来我在生产中体验到组织起来，才能提高劳动效率和生产量。今春我参加省里经济会议，听了杨秀峰主席报告关于组织起来的好处，回家后我即在党的支部会上向全体党员作了宣传；并动员了十六户组成四个拨工小组。我的一组有四户，共有土地七十六亩，男劳动力六个，女劳动力四个，驴两头。在拉土送坯、耕地、拔麦、拉麦等工作中省了二十个工。在拔麦时四家共有三十一亩麦田，四个人两天就拔完了；合每人每天拔四亩，如果单干每人每天只能拔三亩，每日省工两个。这个事实，使群众认清了组织起来的好处。在今年拔麦期间，鼓动了全村二百三十四户中有二百二十三户参加了劳动互助，给今后互助组的发展和提高打下了初步的基础。
    在生产中我也注意掌握农业技术，研究作物的特性。譬如二比斯字棉的特性是枝叶稀疏向四面伸张，占面积大，留苗宜稀。因此，我在播耩棉种时注意耩大垅，行距约一尺八至二尺二（往年不过一尺二），株距约一尺五至一尺八（往年一尺二、三），这样棉花透风长得棵大枝肥。村南受灾轻的棉田，每棵平均结十二个大桃，每亩摘籽棉一百二十斤。但邻地罗得顺家棉田，他种得垅小行挤，不透风，长得棵苗孱弱，每棵只结七、八个小桃，产量减少。我从实际植棉中，也发现棉田垅旁不宜种黄豆，因为黄豆上的火蜘蛛极易传染至棉花上。今年由于经验不够，已经吃亏了，明年将接受这个教训。
    为了使农业增产，我和全村群众很重视选种工作。今年上级确定我村是良棉试验区，我们组织了棉花技术小组，领导全村群众把从省农场领回的二比斯字棉视别检种，并在今年谷雨前将六千斤棉籽进行粒选。因此，使今年棉花质量较往年为好。为保证明年全部种植优良棉种，我又领导了全村进行田间选种，作到单收、单晒、单轧，保证种籽纯洁。今春为推广洋山药，我和村干育苗四十余万棵，推广全村，结果产量较本地山药增加一倍，群众称赞不已。
    目前我正在拟定来年的生产计划。我保证明年的生产量较比今年还要增加。我并将领导全村组织起来，为迅速增加产量而努力。
    此致敬礼

    察哈尔民兵英雄李明：
    村里民兵个个摩拳擦掌准备狠狠打击美国
    强盗亲爱的毛主席：
    我是察哈尔省延庆县白草洼村的李明，自从参加全国战斗英雄代表会议回来后，心里经常惦记着您嘱咐我们的话：和广大人民团结一致，为国家继续作优异的贡献。现在把俺村最近的情形报告给您：
    今年俺村是个灾村，全村农民还是胜利地完成了三秋。秋收时，民兵们积极护秋，没让一粒粮食被人偷去。收获后，全村一千七百四十六亩土地，百分之百完成了秋耕。同时全村七十三户人家积极响应政府秋季选树和种树的号召，选树一万一千二百五十棵；并从政府贷了一百斤山杏种，在近处荒山播种了七十二亩杏树。
    收了秋，俺村农民一刻不停地转移到副业生产上去。从十月初起，每天有二十五、六人到山上打柴背木头，两个月来，挣了小米二十六石，足够全村一冬的生活了。在打柴背木头中，俺村也出了英雄。像阎昌有每趟都背二百一、二十斤，可挣一斗二升米，给大家的鼓励很大。
    俺村的地位很偏僻，交通不便利，常常受投机商人的剥削。现在俺县普遍成立了合作社，俺村的群众都成了合作社的社员。合作社不但高价收购土产品，还低价供给我们的必需品。大家都说：“像这样，一年计算起来，少吃多少亏呀！”
    秋耕后，政府照顾俺村今年受灾免征公粮。可是，俺村今年在农贷方面共贷的牲口、籽种合各种贷粮五千六百五十六斤，都差不多还清了。因为我们懂得农贷是政府扶植人民恢复与发展生产的，今年还了，可以作明年的备用。我正在努力帮助人民银行延庆支行收农贷，希望全村早日还清。
    努力生产的同时，我们并没有忘记村里的文化教育工作。
    今年俺村建立了一所小学校，全村二十五个儿童，已有二十个入了学。但是，我一想起在北京开会时不会签字的苦处，就天天惦记着未上学的那几个孩子。一有时间，我就到各家给家长们解释识字的好处。现在他们的思想慢慢想通了，都说最近就要把孩子全送到学校里去。
    从北京回来以后，我到谁家去串门就谁家拉话在苏联人民和中国人民的友爱。我尽力把苏联人民的生活、文化、经济的情形说给大家听。大家听了谁都说要向苏联人民学习。俺村的王怀明、陈永顺等十七人都成了中苏友协的会员。
    亲爱的毛主席：正当我们渴望的幸福生活靠近的时候，美帝竟疯狂地侵略朝鲜和我国。俺村组织了“读报组”。每当读到美帝血腥屠杀朝鲜人民和轰炸我东北同胞的时候，大家的心里像燃起了烈火。在这时，我不由得想起了过去全家吃糠咽菜，想起了连扛十三年长工的痛苦，想起了日本“三光政策”的洗劫。在我翻了身的今天，美帝又要来夺取我们的胜利果实，难道我能在家里袖手旁观吗？
    亲爱的毛主席：俺村十八名民兵，除了白天背木头之外，晚上就练习埋雷、起雷、瞄准，而且现在已经练熟了。大家都摩拳擦掌要一起到朝鲜去，用我们的爆炸经验，狠狠地打击美国强盗。敬礼！
                   民兵英雄李明（察南银行办事处王韶光代笔）
