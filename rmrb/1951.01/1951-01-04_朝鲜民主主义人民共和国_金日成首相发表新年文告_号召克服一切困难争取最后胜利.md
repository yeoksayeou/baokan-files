Xinhua News Agency, Somewhere in North Korea, January 1st: Kim Il-sung, Premier of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, issued the following New Year's message on New Year's Day:

Dear Comrades, Brothers and Sisters!

Heroic commanders and fighters of the People's Army and male and female guerrillas!

As we greet the New Year of 1951, on behalf of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, I extend New Year's greetings and honors to the people of the whole country who are fighting heroically for the victory of the great Fatherland Liberation War.

Last year was an epoch-making year unprecedented in Korean history. Last year was not only a year of struggle for the construction of a democratic fatherland, but also a historically significant year of waging a war against the American imperialist aggressors who instigated the traitorous Lee Seung-man gang to provoke a fratricidal civil war and openly and brazenly launched armed aggression against Korea.

In the first six months of last year, we continued our peaceful construction. The remaining six months were spent in an environment of fierce struggle against the armed aggression of the American imperialist bandits and their lackeys, the traitorous Lee Seung-man gang.

Therefore, 1950 was a year of turning point in our country's history, when our fatherland interrupted peaceful construction and began the great Fatherland Liberation War against the head of international reactionaries, the American imperialist aggressors.

Six Months of Just War Against American Aggressors

Dear Comrades, Brothers and Sisters!

The Fatherland Unification Democratic Front, representing the will of all Korean people, and our Republic government have exhausted all efforts and sincerity for the peaceful unification of the fatherland that the Korean people long for. However, due to the traitorous acts of the Lee Seung-man traitors who betrayed the fatherland and the people, our efforts ultimately came to naught. The Lee Seung-man traitorous gang not only consistently hindered the peaceful unification of the fatherland, but also, on June 25, 1950, at the instigation of the American imperialists, brazenly launched a military invasion north of the 38th parallel.

As soon as the Lee Seung-man puppet army invaded the area north of the 38th parallel, the Korean People's Army, which defended the independence, freedom and honor of the fatherland, immediately displayed unlimited loyalty and bravery, repelled the puppet army's invasion, switched to counter-offensive, and pursued and annihilated the retreating enemy. Amidst the cheers of all Korean people, it liberated many cities and villages in southern Korea from the fascist tyranny of Lee Seung-man.

However, the American imperialists, panicked by the heroic Korean People's Army's counter-offensive and the Lee Seung-man gang's disastrous defeat, openly and brazenly intervened in the Korean civil war. The American imperialists bombed Korean cities and villages alike, massacring peaceful people in large numbers.

Therefore, blood stained the land that our ancestors had worked hard to manage for generations. Factories, manufacturers, cities and villages, houses and family property, built with the blood and sweat of the Korean people, were turned into ashes.

However, this open and beastly armed intervention by the American imperialists could not subdue the fighting spirit of the Korean people who rose up to defend the independence, freedom and honor of the fatherland. On the contrary, it further ignited their hatred for the enemy.

Less than a month after the start of the war, the heroic Korean People's Army advanced to the southern coast and the Nakdong River area, around Daegu, liberated more than 90 percent of the entire Korean territory and more than 92 percent of the population, and established a true people's power – the People's Committee – in the liberated areas, implementing various democratic reforms with land reform as the main focus.

From the beginning of the war on June 25 to August 15, the enemy's total strength was killed, wounded or captured at more than 64,000 people, with the loss of more than 14,000 rifles of various types and more than 1,000 artillery pieces of various types. However, the American imperialists, attempting to seize Korea by force, disregarding the above-mentioned significant losses suffered in Korea, mobilized all the land, sea and air forces along the Pacific coast to continue the aggressive war of massacring our Korean people with new reinforcements. Therefore, our People's Army had to make a temporary retreat under the attack of the numerically superior enemy. The enemy occupied most of our country's territory and trampled on millions of our compatriots.

The American imperialist bandits and the puppet Lee Seung-man traitors forcibly seized the various democratic rights and the results of various democratic reforms that the Korean people had won after liberation, and subjected millions of outstanding Korean sons and daughters to beastly acts such as massacre and humiliation.

Our Korean people will never forget the aggression and atrocities committed by the American imperialist bandits and the Lee Seung-man traitorous gang in our country, and we must strike the enemy with the sword of severe revenge.

Dear Comrades, Brothers and Sisters!

Due to the attack of the superior forces of the American imperialist invading army, our People's Army had to retreat temporarily. Of course, this was a strategic retreat. This was to preserve the main force of our People's Army, prepare again, and at the same time cultivate reserve forces, preparing the possibility of a counter-offensive.

The heroic Korean People's Army also inflicted heavy blows on the enemy during the retreat, accumulated new combat experience, thereby increasing its invincible combat power. The entire Korean people did not yield to the enemy during the most difficult retreat period, but united more closely around the Republic government, organized a nationwide guerrilla movement in the enemy's rear, and launched practical patriotic actions for the fatherland.

Thus, the entire Korean people, who stood up to defend the independence, freedom and honor of the fatherland, demonstrated their determination to dedicate every last drop of blood and strive for final victory even if there are any sacrifices and difficulties.

People All Over the World Sympathize with and Support the Korean People

The Korean people are by no means isolated in this just struggle. The people of the people's democratic countries, headed by the great Soviet people, and all freedom-loving people have given us great sympathy and support from the first day of the war. In particular, the people of our great neighbor China dispatched their volunteer army during our difficult period of retreat, and under the command of the Korean People's Army General Headquarters, fought in coordination with the Korean People's Army to thwart the enemy's attack. They shattered the enemy's attempt to push the People's Army to the Yalu River and annex the entire Korea in one fell swoop. In less than two months, the People's Army reorganized its forces and entered a new stage where it could launch a counter-offensive. Under the command of the Korean People's Army General Headquarters, the close coordinated operations of the heroic Korean People's Army, the guerrillas bravely active in the enemy's rear, and the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers, after launching a counter-offensive, in just a few days, we inflicted a devastating blow on the enemies who invaded north of the Chongchon River, and on December 6, liberated our strong democratic base, Pyongyang City. Now we have recovered the area north of the 38th parallel, pursuing the enemy fleeing in chaos, liberated Kaesong, Yonbaek and other places, and continue to attack south.

Dear Comrades, Brothers and Sisters! This is, simply speaking, the situation of our great Fatherland Liberation War in the past six months.

As is well known, our war has changed its nature in the course of the war. If the initial stage of the war was called a domestic war to eliminate the Lee Seung-man puppet army that provoked fratricidal strife in our fatherland and to strive for the unification and independence of the fatherland; then, after the American imperialists appeared in our country in a posture of open armed intervention, our war became a great Fatherland Liberation War of the entire Korean people against the aggression of the American imperialist aggressors and their lackeys, the Lee Seung-man traitors, to defend the independence, freedom and honor of the fatherland, and to eliminate the invading armies. The American imperialists instigated the Lee Seung-man traitors to provoke a civil war in Korea and carry out armed aggression against Korea. Their conspiracy was not limited to forcibly occupying Korea and turning the Korean people into colonial slaves. The enemy's sinister purpose is not only to seize and plunder our country, to use Korea as a military strategic base, but also to enslave all the people of Asia, and then attempt to conquer the world. Therefore, the Korean people's just liberation war against the American imperialist aggressors and for the independence, freedom and honor of the fatherland not only opened a new and epoch-making page in the long history of our fatherland, but also established a monument that will never be forgotten in the cause of national liberation movements in all countries against imperialist aggression. Indeed, the great Fatherland Liberation War we are waging is a banner of the liberation movement of the oppressed nations all over the world. The heroic Korean people will victoriously complete this noble and glorious Fatherland Liberation War, and will inevitably achieve victory.

The War of Aggression Against Korea by the American and Lee Gang Will Inevitably Fail

Dear Comrades, Brothers and Sisters!

Now people all over the world see that the war of aggression against our fatherland and people by the American imperialist aggressors and the Lee Seung-man traitorous gang is bound to fail. Even the reactionary camp within the United States cannot but admit that their war is in an irretrievable crisis. So, what are the reasons why the enemy is bound to fail? And what are the conditions that we can certainly strive for final victory? Of course, human history proves the victory of just wars and the failure of unjust wars. What must be pointed out here is that the American imperialists did not correctly estimate the consolidation of our Republic's advanced people's power, and underestimated the united strength of our People's Army and the rear. As is well known, the American bandits mobilized a large force of land, sea and air forces to invade our country, and clamored that they would "overthrow" our Republic before Christmas (December 25), and would advance to the Yalu River in a short period of time. But the facts have proved that such calculations were rash and illusory. And now this arrogant plan has been permanently bankrupt. The American imperialists estimated that our people's power and our rear were not solid, and妄想 that when our People's Army was severely attacked, there would be riots in our rear. However, these were completely enemy's low-energy miscalculations. The heroic Korean people established a strong rear, and in the most difficult times, under the banner of our Republic, assisted the People's Army in all aspects; responding to the call of the Republic government, "Everything for the front," "Everything for victory," everyone was mobilized; and through this war, powerfully proved the superiority of the true people's power that we have cultivated and strengthened with our hands in the five years since liberation. This is one of the important conditions to ensure our final victory.

The American imperialists estimated that our People's Army was still young, and妄想 that it could crush our land, sea and air forces with one blow. However, the enemy also made a mistake in this regard, overestimating its own strength and underestimating the strength of our People's Army. Of course, our People's Army is a young army. However, the morale of our People's Army is higher than the morale of the American invading army. Resisting foreign armed aggressors, defending the freedom of one's fatherland, believing in the righteousness of one's cause, and the ideological consciousness of defending the independence and freedom of one's fatherland and completing the just war, have forged our People's Army into an invincible army like steel. On the contrary, the American imperialist invading army is an army that has lost its moral basis, exposing corrupt discipline and the face of direct aggressors and plunderers. Therefore, our People's Army was able to inflict heavy blows on the tyrannical American invading army, and even during the most difficult period of retreat, there was no ideological shaking, and it completed the organized retreat of the main force and preserved the basic military cadres; in just two months, it reorganized into a stronger force and was able to launch a counter-offensive. This war truly proved that the Korean People's Army, established by the outstanding sons and daughters of the Korean people, is a strong fortress to defend the fatherland. This is one of the necessary conditions to ensure our final victory.

Finally, we have another most powerful guarantee to strive for final victory, that is, in the just struggle against the American imperialist plunderers who are invading our country, the Korean people are not isolated. The voices of "Get out of Korea" shouted by freedom-loving people all over the world have resounded throughout the world, and the sympathy and support of hundreds of millions of people are concentrated on us. The great Soviet people have always given great assistance to the struggle of our Korean people. The people of our neighboring country China have dispatched the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers to directly participate in the war to eliminate the common enemy of the Korean and Chinese people - the American imperialist invading army. Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Bulgaria, Mongolia, Romania and other people's democratic countries have continuously sent a large number of aid supplies to our People's Army and war victims. Therefore, the firm confidence and infinite strength of the Korean people, who are fighting against the American aggressors for the honor of the fatherland and the happiness of the people, comes from the absolute support given to us by the great Soviet people and the Chinese people, as well as the people of the various people's democratic countries and freedom-loving people all over the world.

The Tasks of the Korean People to Greet the Final Victory Dear Comrades, Brothers and Sisters!

Heroic commanders and fighters of the Korean People's Army and male and female guerrillas!

Under the attack of the heroic Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, the enemy is retreating in chaos, but has not been completely defeated. Although the enemy has suffered a huge blow, the treacherous enemy is still struggling to achieve its goals. But now the initiative of the war is in our hands, we will increase the speed of the attack, and we are confident that in the near future, we will liberate the territory of our fatherland from the bloody hands of the enemy. However, we must never be complacent or at ease because of the success we have already achieved. Do not forget that although we have opened the road to final victory, there are still many difficulties and tortuous roads ahead.

We must overcome all difficulties and go through cruel struggles and sacrifices to win the final victory. Therefore, in order to end the new year of 1951 with the final victory, I call on the entire Korean people to carry out the following tasks:

The entire Korean people should continue all the undertakings they are responsible for for the victory of the front, and should reorganize them according to the interests of the front. Due to the acceleration of the attack, the front has expanded, and the distance between the front and the rear has become longer. In order to perfectly guarantee the needs of the front, it is necessary to organize the work of supporting the front in a mobile and extensive manner, and to ensure the reserve forces of the front.

In the liberated areas, a nationwide undertaking should be launched to quickly maintain order, restore the production, transportation, and cultural institutions in the destroyed cities and villages; and give the people who have been freed from the clutches of American imperialism normal living conditions. Quickly launch the construction of destroyed houses and stabilize people's lives. All workers and technicians should improve their skills and abilities more than ever before, and quickly restore factories, mines, enterprises, etc. that have been destroyed by enemy bombing. In particular, in order to guarantee the clothing and daily necessities of the war victims who have lost their families and their property has been burned, the enterprises and production cooperative undertakings of the light industry sector should be quickly restored and expanded. All transportation personnel should widely and actively launch the construction and restoration of railways and communication facilities and roads and bridges that have been destroyed by the enemy during the retreat, and should be good at ensuring military activities and the transportation of military supplies. All farmers should recognize the urgent food situation caused by the American bandits' scorched earth burning, and should pay agricultural in-kind taxes and donate patriotic grain to supply grain to our People's Army and ensure the grain for the army, workers and staff; and should ensure the spring plowing in 1951 in a timely manner, and should exert all efforts in the plowing work. All farmers should realize that the struggle for grain is the struggle for the fatherland during this period, and should strive to save and increase grain production.

All scientific and artistic workers should improve the advanced ideological consciousness of the entire people to serve the country and the people during wartime, and should combine the science and knowledge they have mastered with the war and restoration work to actively help, and should quickly start to restore the destroyed education and cultural undertakings.

All commanders and fighters of the People's Army should further improve combat training and further consolidate the organization and discipline of the army. Commanders at all levels should learn how to lead troops, mobility, and cooperation between various units during combat; in actual combat, they should bravely accept and apply the experience of advanced guards, and strive to improve and develop our reconnaissance work; they should master Lenin's saying "First, do not be overwhelmed by victory and complacency; second, further consolidate victory; third, thoroughly eliminate the enemy," further strengthen the speed of attack on the enemy, and do not give the enemy time to breathe, do not give the enemy a chance to build a position in the rear, and do not give the enemy time to reorganize its forces.

All male and female guerrillas should further expand the flames of guerrilla warfare in the enemy's rear, continue to constantly raid the enemy, destroy and cut off the enemy's transportation lines, completely block the enemy's transportation and communication tools, assist the attacking People's Army in all aspects, and do not let the enemy escape one, catch them, and annihilate them. In this way, our final victory will be guaranteed.

Dear Comrades, Brothers and Sisters!

Greeting the New Year of 1951, let us move towards the new victory of the great Fatherland Liberation War! Honor belongs to the Korean people who are marching towards victory!

Long live our glorious fatherland!

Annihilate the American imperialist plunderers and the Lee Seung-man traitorous gang! (With pictures)

　　朝鲜民主主义人民共和国
    金日成首相发表新年文告 
    号召克服一切困难争取最后胜利
    【新华社讯】朝鲜中央通讯社朝鲜北部某地一日讯：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府金日成首相，于元旦发表新年文告如下：
    亲爱的同胞兄弟姊妹们！
    英勇的人民军指挥员与战斗员和男女游击队员们！
    值兹迎接一九五一年新年之际，我以朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的名义，向争取伟大的祖国解放战争的胜利而英勇斗争着的全国人民，致新年的祝福和荣誉。
    去年一年是朝鲜历史上未曾有过的划时代的一年。去年一年不只是为了建设民主的祖国而斗争的一年，而且也是进行反对唆使李承晚卖国匪帮挑拨同族相残的内战并悍然公开武装侵入朝鲜的美帝国主义侵略者的战争的有历史意义的一年。
    我们在去年头六个月继续了我们的和平建设。其余六个月则是在反对美帝国主义强盗和其走狗李承晚卖国匪帮武装侵略的激烈斗争的环境中度过的。
    因此，一九五○年是我们祖国中断了和平建设、开始了反对国际反动派头目美帝国主义侵略者的伟大的祖国解放战争的我国历史转折的一年。
    半年来反对美国侵略者的正义战争
    亲爱的同胞兄弟姊妹们！
    代表全体朝鲜人民意志的祖国统一民主主义战线和我们的共和国政府，为了朝鲜人民所渴望的祖国的和平统一，曾竭尽一切的努力和诚意。但由于李承晚叛徒们背叛祖国与人民的卖国行为，使我们的努力最后成为泡影。李承晚卖国匪帮不但始终阻碍祖国的和平统一，而且于一九五○年六月二十五日在美帝国主义者唆使之下，悍然向三八线以北发动了军事侵犯。
    当李承晚傀儡军队一侵入三八线以北地域，保卫祖国独立、自由和荣誉的朝鲜人民军，立即发挥了无限的忠诚和英勇，击退了傀儡军的入侵，转入反攻，并追击和歼灭溃退的敌人，在全体朝鲜人民欢呼中，从李承晚法西斯暴力统治中，解放了朝鲜南部的许多城市和农村。
    但是，由于英勇的朝鲜人民军的反攻和李承晚匪帮如此惨败而惊慌失措的美帝国主义者，竟公开武装干涉朝鲜的内战。美帝国主义者对朝鲜的城市和农村进行同样的轰炸，大量地屠杀和平的人民。
    因此，鲜血沾染了我们祖先世世代代努力经营的国土。以朝鲜人民的血汗建设的工厂、制造所、城市和农村、住宅和家产，变成了灰烬。
    但是，美帝国主义者这种公开的兽性的武装干涉，并不能压服为保卫祖国的独立、自由和荣誉而奋起的朝鲜人民的斗志，相反地，却更加燃烧起他们对敌人的憎恨。
    战争开始后还不到一个月，英勇的朝鲜人民军进击到南海岸和洛东江地区、大邱一带，解放了全朝鲜百分之九十以上的地区和百分之九十二以上的人口，并在解放地区建立了真正的人民政权——人民委员会，实行了以土地改革为主的各种民主改革。
    自战争开始的六月二十五日至八月十五日为止，敌人的有生力量共被杀伤或俘虏六万四千余人，损失了各种步枪一万四千余枝、各种炮一千余门。但是，企图强占朝鲜的美帝国主义者，不顾在朝鲜遭到了上述的重大的损失，又全部动员了在太平洋沿岸的陆海空军，以新的支援兵力继续展开屠杀我们朝鲜人民的侵略战争。因此，我们人民军队在数量上占优势的敌人的进攻之下，不得不作暂时的撤退。敌人占领了我国疆域的大部分，蹂躏了我们数百万的同胞。
    美帝国主义强盗和傀儡李承晚叛徒们强夺了解放后朝鲜人民所争取到的各项民主权利和各种民主改革的成果，并对数百万朝鲜优秀儿女施以屠杀、侮辱等野兽行为。
    我们朝鲜人民永远也不会忘记美帝国主义强盗和李承晚卖国匪帮在我国进行的侵略和暴行，我们一定要把严厉的复仇之剑斩在敌人身上。
    亲爱的同胞兄弟姊妹们！
    由于美帝国主义侵略军队优势力量的进攻，我们人民军曾暂时撤退。当然这是战略上的撤退。这是为了保存我们人民军的主力，再作准备，同时培养后备军，准备反攻的可能性。
    英勇的朝鲜人民军在撤退过程中也给予敌人沉重的打击，积累了新的战斗经验，从而增加了自己不可战胜的战斗力量。全体朝鲜人民在最艰苦的撤退时期中，没有向敌人屈服，更紧密地团结在共和国政府的周围，在敌人后方组织了全民性的游击运动，展开了为祖国的实际的爱国行动。
    如此，为了保卫祖国的独立、自由和荣誉而站起来的全体朝鲜人民，表明了即使有任何牺牲和难关也要献出最后一滴血，争取最后胜利的决心。
    全世界人民同情并支援朝鲜人民
    朝鲜人民在这正义的斗争中决不是孤立的。以伟大的苏联人民为首的各人民民主国家人民及全体爱好自由的人民，从战争头一天就给我们莫大的同情与声援。尤其是伟大邻邦中国的人民，在我们撤退的困难时期，出了自己的志愿部队，在朝鲜人民军总司令部指挥之下，与朝鲜人民军协同作战，挫败了敌人的进攻。粉碎了敌人想一鼓作气把人民军推到鸭绿江边、吞并整个朝鲜的企图。人民军在不到两个月的时期中整编了兵力，进入了能展开反攻的新阶段。在朝鲜人民军总司令部的指挥下，英勇的朝鲜人民军、在敌后勇敢活动的游击部队和英勇的中国人民志愿部队的紧密的协同作战，在展开了反攻之后没有几天，我们就给侵越清川江以北的敌人以歼灭性的打击，并且在十二月六日解放了我们坚强的民主基地平壤市。现在我们收复了三八线以北地区，追击着混乱地逃跑的敌人，解放了开城、延白等地，并继续向南进攻中。
    亲爱的同胞兄弟姊妹们！我们伟大的祖国解放战争过去六个月的情况，简单地讲，就是如此。
    众所周知，我们的战争已在战争过程中改变了它的性质。假如把战争初期叫做消灭在我们祖国内挑拨同族相争的李承晚傀儡军队、争取祖国统一独立的国内战争；那么，在美帝国主义者在我国以公开武装干涉的姿态出现以后，我们的战争就成为全朝鲜人民反对美帝国主义侵略者及其走狗李承晚卖国贼的侵害，保卫祖国独立、自由及荣誉，消灭侵略军队的伟大祖国解放战争。美帝国主义者唆使李承晚卖国贼在朝鲜挑拨内战，对朝鲜进行武力侵略，其阴谋不只限于强占朝鲜，把朝鲜人民变为殖民地奴隶。敌人的凶恶的目的，不但是要强占和掠夺我国，把朝鲜作为军事战略基地，并要奴役全亚洲人民，进而企图征服全世界。因此，朝鲜人民反对美帝国主义侵略者，争取祖国独立、自由及荣誉的正义的解放战争，不但在我们祖国悠久的历史上开辟了新的划时代的一页，并且在反对帝国主义侵略的一切国家的民族解放运动事业上建立起永远不被忘记的纪念碑。的确，我们在进行着的伟大的祖国解放战争，是一面全世界被压迫民族解放运动的旗帜。英勇的朝鲜人民一定会胜利地完成这个崇高而又光荣的祖国解放战争，并且必然会得到胜利。
    美李匪军侵朝战争必然失败
    亲爱的同胞兄弟姊妹们！
    现在全世界的人民都看到美帝国主义侵略者及李承晚卖国匪帮侵略我们祖国与人民的战争必然要失败。甚至美国内部反动阵营也不能不承认他们的战争已处于不可挽救的危境。那么，敌人必然会失败的理由在那里呢？而我们一定能争取最后胜利的条件又是什么呢？当然，人类的历史证实着正义战争的胜利与非正义战争的失败。在这里必须指出的是美帝国主义者没有正确估计我们共和国先进的人民政权的巩固性，而且过低估计了我们的人民军与后方团结一致的力量。众所周知，美国强盗们动员了陆海空军的庞大兵力侵略我国，大肆叫嚣在圣诞节（十二月二十五日）以前“打倒”我们共和国，短时期内就可以推进到鸭绿江边。但事实却证明这样的打算是轻率而虚妄的。而现在这个狂妄的计划已永远破产了。美帝国主义者估计我们人民政权和我们后方不巩固，妄想我们人民军受到沉重打击的时候，我们的后方会发生暴动。可是，这些完全是敌人的低能的错误估计。英勇的朝鲜人民建立起坚强的后方，在最困难的时期，在我们共和国的旗帜之下，从各方面援助了人民军；响应共和国政府所发出的“一切为了前线”、“一切为了胜利”的号召，每一个人都动员起来；并且通过这次战争，有力地证明了解放后五年之间用我们的手培养和加强的真正的人民政权的优越性。这是保障我们最后胜利的重要条件之一。
    美帝国主义者估计我们的人民军还年青，妄想一击就可以粉碎我们的陆海军。可是敌人在这一方面也犯了错误，过高估计了自己的力量，而过低估计了我们人民军的力量。当然，我们的人民军是年青的军队。可是，我们人民军的士气比美国侵略军队的士气高昂。反抗外国武装侵略者、保卫自己祖国的自由、确信自己事业的正义性、为保卫祖国独立与自由、完成正义战争的思想意识，使我们人民军锻炼成为钢铁般的不可被战胜的军队。与此相反，美帝国主义侵略军队是丧失了道德根据的军队，暴露出腐败的纪律与直接侵略掠夺者的面目。因此，我们的人民军能给强暴的美国侵略军队以沉重的打击，并在最困难的撤退时期也没有发生思想动摇，完成了主力部队的有组织的撤退工作，保存了基本军事干部；仅仅在两个月之内，就整编出更强大的武力，已可以进行反攻。这次战争，确实地证明了朝鲜人民优秀的儿女所建立的朝鲜人民军是保卫祖国的坚强堡垒。这是保障我们最后胜利的必要的条件之一。
    最后，我们还有一个争取最后胜利的最有力的保证，就是在反对侵略我们国土的美帝国主义掠夺者的正义的斗争中，朝鲜人民并不是孤立的。全世界爱好自由的人民高喊的“退出朝鲜去”的声音已响遍了全世界，亿万人民的同情与支持集中在我们身上。伟大的苏联人民对我们朝鲜人民的斗争，始终一贯地给予巨大的援助。邻邦中国人民派遣了英勇的中国人民志愿部队，直接参加了消灭朝、中两国人民的共同的敌人——美帝国主义侵略军队的战争。匈牙利、捷克斯洛伐克、波兰、保加利亚、蒙古、罗马尼亚等各人民民主国家给我们人民军及战争灾民不断送来大量的援助品。因此，为祖国的荣誉与人民的幸福而进行反对美国侵略者的斗争的朝鲜人民之胜利的坚强的信心和无限力量的源泉，是来自伟大苏联人民及中国人民以及各人民民主国家人民和全世界爱好自由的人民给我们的绝对的支援。
    朝鲜人民迎接最后胜利的任务亲爱的同胞兄弟姊妹们！
    英勇的朝鲜人民军指挥员战斗员及男女游击队员们！
    在英勇的朝鲜人民军及中国人民志愿部队的进攻之下，敌人正在混乱地退却，可是尚未完全被击破。敌人虽然受到巨大的打击，但奸恶的敌人为了达到目的，正继续挣扎着。可是现在战争的主动权在我们的手里，我们将增加进攻的速度，确信在不久的将来，会将祖国疆土从敌人的血腥的手里解放出来。可是，我们绝对不能因已获得的成功而自满或安心。不要忘记，我们虽然打开了最后胜利的道路，但前面还存在着许多难关和崎岖的道路。
    我们要克服一切困难，经过残酷的斗争和牺牲，才能争取最后胜利。因此，为了以最后胜利来结束一九五一年新的一年，我号召全体朝鲜人民执行下列任务：
    全体朝鲜人民应为前线的胜利把自己所担负的一切事业继续下去，并应根据前线的利益加以改组。由于进攻的加速，前线扩大了，前线和后方的距离远了。为了完善地保障前方的需要，要有机动性地广泛组织支援前线的工作，保证前线的后备兵力。
    在解放地区应展开全民性的事业，迅速维持秩序，恢复被破坏的城市和乡村中的生产事业、运输、和文化机关；对于从美帝国主义的魔掌解脱出来的人民，给予正常的生活条件。迅速展开修建被破坏的房屋和安定人民生活等事业。全体工人和技术人员对自己的技术和能力，比任何时期更要提高，迅速恢复由于敌人轰炸而被破坏的工厂、矿山、企业等。特别是为了保障失去家庭、财物被烧的战争灾民的衣著与日常生活物资，应迅速恢复与扩大轻工业部门的企业和生产合作社事业。全体交通运输人员应广泛地、积极地展开修建、恢复那些被敌人在退却时破坏的铁路与通信机关及道路与桥梁，并应善于保障军事活动与军需物资的运输。全体农民应认识到由于美国强盗们的焦土性的烧毁而引起的迫切的粮食情况，要缴纳农业现物税并献纳爱国粮，为我们人民军队供给粮食，保证军队、工人及职员的粮食；并要及时保证一九五一年的春耕，应在耕种工作上发挥一切力量。全体农民在这个时期中应认识为粮食的斗争就是为祖国的斗争，应为节约和增产粮食而奋斗。
    全体科学艺术者应提高全体人民在战时为国家和人民服务的先进思想意识，并把自己所掌握的科学及知识与战争和恢复工作结合起来，积极加以帮助，并应迅速着手恢复被破坏的教育文化事业。
    全体人民军指挥员和战斗员要更加提高战斗训练，更加巩固军队的组织性与纪律性。各级指挥员要学好带兵与机动性以及在战斗时各部队间的配合；在实际战斗中要勇敢地接受和运用先进近卫部队的经验，努力改善与发展我们的侦察工作；要掌握列宁所说的“第一、不要在胜利中冲昏头脑和自满；第二、进一步巩固胜利；第三、彻底消灭敌人”的真理，更加加强对敌人进攻的速度，不给敌人喘息的时间，不给敌人在后方构筑阵地的机会，不给敌人整顿兵力的时间。
    全体男女游击队员要在敌人的后方更加扩大游击战争的火焰，继续不断地奇袭敌人，破坏和切断敌人的交通线，应该完全封锁敌人的运输与交通联络工具，在各方面援助进攻的人民军，不让敌人逃走一个，抓住他们，歼灭他们。这样，我们的最后胜利就有了保障。
    亲爱的同胞兄弟姊妹们！
    迎接一九五一年的新年，向着伟大的祖国解放战争的新的胜利迈进吧！荣誉属于向着胜利迈进的朝鲜人民！
    我们的光荣的祖国万岁！
    歼灭美帝国主义掠夺者与李承晚卖国匪帮！（附图片）
