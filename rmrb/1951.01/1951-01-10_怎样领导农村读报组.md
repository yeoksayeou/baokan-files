　　How to Lead Rural Newspaper Reading Groups
　　Li Tai, Propaganda Minister of the CPC Ding County Committee, Hebei Province

　　There are 2,717 villages and towns in Ding County, of which 398 villages have established 495 newspaper reading groups. Comparing by county, Wuqi, Li County, and Anping County are better. According to the September 1950 statistics, Wuqi County had 197 newspaper reading groups established in 94 villages; Li County established 80 groups in 57 villages; and Anping established 59 groups. After the establishment of the reading groups, the masses were very enthusiastic about listening to the newspaper readings. For example, in Xiaofeng Village in Shenze, more than 80 people listened to the newspaper readings every night.

　　Ding County Committee proposed to carry out newspaper reading work at the meeting of propaganda ministers of various counties held by the County Committee in May last year. In July, the Propaganda Department of the County Committee summarized and exchanged the experiences of various places in leading newspaper reading groups. In August, the counties and districts generally began to pay attention to this work.

　　The experience of carrying out newspaper reading work in the past few months has told cadres in various places that newspaper reading groups have a great effect on implementing the policies of the Party and the People's Government, raising people's awareness, and promoting work. Here are some examples: Zhang Jingman, a young woman from Beihou Town, Anping, was engaged to Yang Ruilin in the village through a parental arrangement. She disagreed and often cried, but she did not dare to propose to her parents to break off the engagement. After the reading group explained the Marriage Law, she proposed to break off the engagement and it was realized. The reading group also played a big role in stabilizing the people's production mood when explaining the policy of issuing land certificates. In the peace signature campaign, the reading groups in each village signed the earliest, playing a leading role. More than 300 reading group members in Wuqi enthusiastically signed their names and sent letters to General Kim Il-sung, expressing their concern and support for the Korean War of Liberation. In addition, they have played a certain role in the work of autumn harvest and autumn planting. Methods such as treating cotton aphids, fire dragons, mole crickets, chicken and pig plague, seed soaking, and seed mixing were all first tested by the reading groups and gradually passed on to the masses. Because the reading groups solved problems for the masses, the masses supported the reading groups.

　　How to lead rural newspaper reading groups? We have the following experience:

　　1. Establish newspaper reading groups with a focus. First, try it out in towns, base villages, and villages where organs are stationed, make achievements, and gain experience before popularizing it universally. This requires strengthening the learning of cadres at all levels and attaching importance to the role of newspapers.

　　2. Assign certain departments and cadres to guide the work of newspaper reading groups. In towns with education centers, the education center should be responsible; base villages should be responsible by the base assistant; villages with organs or complete primary schools stationed should be responsible by the cadres designated by the organs or primary school teachers. The Propaganda Department of the Party Committee, the Education Section of the Government, the Youth League, and the Women's Federation should check and supervise at any time. Only by using organizational strength can the newspaper reading work be done well.

　　3. Cultivate reading backbones. Experience has proven that reading groups with backbones can persist for a long time, and those without backbones will collapse. In addition, we must rely on teachers and closely unite with intellectuals in the countryside to make the newspaper reading groups better.

　　4. The best form of newspaper reading groups is to have a fixed person in charge (that is, the leader of the reading group), a fixed location, and a fixed reading time. The above-mentioned successful reading groups are all like this. The second is the civil school-affiliated newspaper reading group, which reads once or twice a week. The third is the teaching station newspaper reading group. This type of reading group is suitable for mountainous areas with scattered villages. There are few literate people in mountain villages. The main village has a reading group leader, and the sub-village has a reader. At a certain time, the reader comes to the main village to listen to the main village reading group leader to tell the newspaper, and then tells the masses after returning to the village. The Baimutai reading group in Fuping is this form.

　　5. How to read the newspaper. According to Anping County's experience, it is like this: (1) Do not recite the articles verbatim when reading the newspaper; add a popular explanation. The reading group of Yang Ruishan in Nanyangzhuang in the second district has therefore been consolidated. (2) Choose more content closely related to the vital interests of the masses to read. That is, reading the newspaper should be combined with the central work. When the masses are about to start autumn plowing, the reading group should select more autumn plowing materials for the masses to read, guiding the masses in autumn plowing. When an epidemic is prevalent, read more about prevention methods and treatment methods. Wang Zhiping, a teacher from Beihou Village, Anping County, did this, and the masses supported him very much. (3) Listen to the opinions of the masses at any time, improve the reading methods, and further meet the requirements of the broad masses of peasants.

　　6. It is necessary to effectively solve the difficulties of the reading groups: such as the problem of kerosene for lamps, the problem of location, and the problem of newspapers. Leaders at all levels must set out responsible and effective solutions and solve them in a timely manner.

### 怎样领导农村读报组

　　怎样领导农村读报组
    中共河北定县地委宣传部长  李太
    定县专区共二千七百十七个村镇，其中三百九十八个村建立起了四百九十五个读报组。以县为单位作比，无极、蠡县、安平三县较好。一九五○年九月份统计，无极全县有九十四村成立了读报组一百九十七个；蠡县五十七村建立了八十个；安平建立了五十九个。读报组建立后，听读报的群众很踊跃，如深泽小封村每夜都有八十余人听读报。
    定县专区在去年五月地委召开的各县宣传部长会议上即提出开展读报工作。七月份，地委宣传部又把各地领导读报组的经验加以总结、交流。在八月份各县、区比较普遍地重视起这个工作。
    几个月来开展读报工作的经验告诉了各地干部：读报组对贯彻党和人民政府的政策、提高人民觉悟、推动工作的作用是很大的。有这样一些例子：安平北侯町青年妇女张敬满，由父母包办与当村杨瑞林订了婚，她不同意，经常哭泣，又不敢向父母提出退婚。读报组讲解了婚姻法后，她提出退婚，并且实现了。读报组在讲发土地证的政策，在安定群众生产情绪上，作用也很大。在和平签名运动中，各村读报组签名最早，起了带头作用。无极三百多读报组员，都踊跃签了名，并给金日成将军去信，表示关切与支援朝鲜解放战争。其他，在秋收、秋种的工作上，都起到一定推动作用。像治棉蚜、火龙、蝼蛄、鸡猪瘟、浸种、拌种等法，都是读报组先作试验，逐渐传给群众的。因为读报组给群众解决了问题，所以群众都拥护读报组。
    怎样来领导农村读报组？我们有下列经验：
    一、有重点地建立读报组。先从城镇、基点村、机关驻村试办，作出成绩，取得经验后，再普遍推广。这首先要加强各级干部的学习，重视报纸的作用。
    二、责成一定部门、一定干部来指导读报组工作。有教育馆的城镇，应由教育馆负责；基点村应由基点助理员负责；驻有机关或完小的村庄，应由机关指定干部或小学教员负责。党委宣传部、政府教育科、青年团、妇会应随时检查督促。只有使用组织力量，才能办好读报工作。
    三、培养读报骨干。经验证明，凡有骨干的读报组，便能坚持长久，没骨干便走向垮台。此外还要依靠教师，紧密的团结在乡知识分子，才能把读报组办得更好。
    四、读报组的形式，以固定负责人（即读报组长），固定地点，固定读报时间为最好。上述有成绩的读报组都是这样的。其次民校附设读报组，每星期读一次或两次。第三种是传授站读报组。这种读报组适合于村庄分散的山区。山区村庄识字人少，主村设读报组长，副村设一读报员，一定时间读报员来主村听主村读报组长讲报，回村后再讲给群众。阜平的百亩台读报组即是这种形式。
    五、怎样读报。据安平县的经验是这样：（一）读报不要死念条文；要加以通俗解释。二区南杨庄杨瑞山的读报组，便因此巩固。（二）要多选与群众切身利益紧密相联的内容来读。也就是读报要与中心工作相结合。当群众要开始秋耕时，读报组应多选秋耕材料给群众读，指导了群众秋耕。时疫流行，要多读防疫法，治疗法，安平县北侯町村教员王志屏这样做，群众很拥护。（三）随时听取群众意见，改进读报方法，进一步满足广大农民群众的要求。
    六、要切实解决读报组的困难：如灯油问题，地址问题、报纸问题，各级领导上必须定出负责有效解决办法，予以及时解决。
