　　In the Stalin Electoral District of Moscow
　　—A Record of the Soviet Local Soviet Elections
　　Li He, Du Yi
　　I. Words from the Bottom of the People’s Hearts

　　In the days leading up to the Soviet local Soviet elections (December 17, 1950), the voters of the Stalin Electoral District in Moscow, like the people in many parts of the Soviet Union, were filled with a surging emotion: eagerly awaiting the opportunity to personally vote for Stalin and other candidate representatives of the Communist Party and the non-Communist alliance. This emotion reflects one of the great strengths of Soviet socialist society—the spiritual and political unity of the Soviet people.

　　The spirit of the Soviet people closely uniting around the Bolshevik Party and Stalin, striving for peace and for the construction of communism, is particularly vividly expressed in the selfless labor in preparation for the election, in the enthusiastic speeches at various meetings before the election, in the sincere conversations between voters and candidate representatives, and in the moving letters written by voters to the propaganda stations. These ordinary voters often express their feelings in simple poems, which, in the words of Pravda, are "truly words from the bottom of the people's hearts."

　　A common sentiment in the hearts of millions of Soviet voters is: "Voting for Stalin is voting for the happiness of our people, voting for our joyful life, voting for lasting world peace." During the election, they sing of life and happiness, as written in the poem by Yabilina, a female inspector at the electric bulb factory: "The motherland is great and beautiful, flourishing with golden spring all year round, from boundless fields, from enormous cities, happy songs come from all directions." Or as sung by Malinkina, a female worker at the Sherbakov Textile Factory: "Our children are growing up happily, our future lies in them. We also know: there is no other place in the world where life is better and more pleasant."

　　II. Meetings Between Voters and Candidate Representatives

　　At 7:15 PM on December 10, 1950, at the propaganda station of the first electoral district in the Stalin District of Moscow, we witnessed the meeting between voters and candidate representatives.

　　This electoral district has 2,500 voters. Like the voters in the entire Stalin District, they have their own candidate representatives for the Moscow Oblast Soviet, the Moscow City Soviet, and the Moscow Stalin District Soviet. On election day, voters will cast three ballots simultaneously.

　　The propaganda station is located in the hall of a factory club on Electric Factory Street. On the front wall, several red flags of labor competition winners are hung in a crisscross pattern, setting off a bas-relief of Lenin and a bronze statue of Stalin. On either side of the statues are two red banners with the words: "Long live Stalin, the creator of the world's most democratic constitution, the inspirer and organizer of the victory of communism!" "The local Soviet elections are a new and powerful review of the spiritual and political unity of the Soviet people!" On the walls on both sides are portraits of members of the Politburo of the CPSU Central Committee and election regulations, etc. A long table is placed in the center of the room, and the attendees sit around the table in a circle.

　　At 7:15, the director of the propaganda station, Viksler, announced the opening of the meeting. He said, "The first candidate representative for the Moscow Oblast Soviet is Stalin. This matter has already caused a production upsurge among the working people in the entire district." Then he introduced the candidate representative for the City Soviet, Ivanov, to meet everyone, and the commissioned introducer, Klevakin, introduced Ivanov's life and social activities to everyone.

　　Ivanov was first nominated by the voters of the Transformer Factory in the 68th Electoral District. He was born in 1905 into a worker's family in the Donbas, and at the age of twelve, he became an apprentice in a mine. In 1926, he went to the Moscow Electric Factory as a laborer, and later became a blacksmith. From 1927 to 1929, he served in the Red Army, and in 1928 he joined the Communist Party. Later, he returned to the Transformer Factory, which belonged to the Electric Factory, and due to his outstanding labor, he became the leader of a production team and the director of the iron foundry. He is experienced, knowledgeable, and has organizational skills. In 1937, he became the director of the Transformer Factory, is good at management, and cares about the demands of workers and staff. Under his leadership, the factory produced new types of transformers, and received the Order of Lenin and the Order of the Red Banner of Labor. Ivanov has a high reputation among the workers. In 1939, he was elected as a representative to the District Soviet. In 1945, he served as the Chairman of the District Soviet, and in 1947, he was elected as a representative to the Moscow City Soviet. He is a standing committee member of the CPSU Stalin District Party Committee, the Minister of the Local Industry Department of the Moscow City Soviet, and the Chairman of the Public Utilities Committee. He has received seven orders and four medals.

　　After the introduction, five voters came forward to express their opinions. They unanimously expressed their love for Stalin and their trust in the candidate representative, Ivanov. Durusova, a 58-year-old female worker who has worked in the factory for 35 years, said that she was illiterate during the Tsarist era, but now she studies in the political research group and has a cultural level of seventh grade. One of her daughters is an accountant, another is a pharmacist, and a son is a workshop director. Durusova had heard Stalin's speech on December 11, 1937, on the election day of the Supreme Soviet, and she said that Comrade Stalin said at the time that Soviet representatives should cherish the trust of the people and serve the people loyally. She believes that Ivanov is such a person. Byagovsky, a worker at the Transformer Factory who has worked with Ivanov for 22 years, emphasized that when Ivanov was the workshop director, the workshop became an advanced workshop. When he was the factory director, the factory became an advanced factory. When he was the chairman of the District Soviet, he quickly resolved the residents' demands and installed gas pipes in almost the entire district. He hopes that Ivanov will lead this district to become an advanced district. Kalshnova, a female worker at the Third Factory, has worked at the Third Factory for 21 years. She said, "Before the revolution, we had no right to ask about national affairs, but now Stalin has made us free to discuss the representatives we elect ourselves. Lenin said: Every cook should manage national affairs. Now this sentence has been realized." These speeches won applause from the entire audience.

　　Ivanov then spoke. He first thanked all the personnel of the Kuibyshev Transformer Factory for their trust in him, and then introduced the achievements of Moscow's construction in which he participated, saying that the total output value of the local industry and cooperative industry in Moscow has exceeded 50% of the original target of the post-war five-year plan, and exceeded 90% of the level in 1940. In the past three years, the Moscow municipal construction appropriation was about 9 billion rubles, of which 2.5 billion rubles were used for residential buildings, 1.6 billion rubles were used for public utilities, and 1.8 billion rubles were used for transportation. In Moscow, 129,000 square meters of new houses were built in 1947, 270,000 square meters in 1948, 405,000 square meters in 1949, and 510,960 square meters in 1950. 750,000 square meters will be built in 1951. Moscow is building eight large buildings. In addition, 1.5 billion rubles have been spent in the past three years to build 15,000 houses. The water consumption per citizen is now five times higher than in 1913 and one and a half times higher than in 1940. A total of 2,411,000 square meters of roads have been newly built and repaired in the past three years. In the past four years, a total of 1,130,000 trees and 5,660,000 seedlings have been planted, and 148 street gardens have been established. In 1950, 15 new school buildings were built, and 10 new nurseries and 12 new kindergartens were added. The number of places in kindergartens has increased by 13,000 compared with 1947, and the number of places in nurseries has increased by 4,300. Ivanov finally stated that as a representative of the City Soviet, he will strive to improve the welfare of the citizens.

　　After Ivanov finished his speech, the voters put forward various requests to him. Some asked to speed up the repair work of Electric Factory Street and bridges; some asked to increase the trams in the Izmailovo workers' district; some asked to pay attention to the repair of housing in this district; some asked to set up nurseries and clinics in this district. Ivanov accepted and answered them one by one, and called on everyone to promote the socialist protection movement of houses.

　　At 8:20, the meeting between Ivanov and some of his voters ended happily. Like all gatherings in the Soviet Union, this organized and prepared gathering took only one hour and five minutes.

　　III. Voting for Candidates of the Party and Non-Party Alliance

　　December 17, 1950, the day that tens of millions of people had been looking forward to, arrived. From 6:00 AM to 12:00 PM on this day, citizens of the Russian, Ukrainian, Belarusian, Kazakh, Georgian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Estonian, and Karelian-Finnish Republics who were 18 years of age or older enjoyed the most democratic electoral rights in the world—universal, equal, direct, and secret elections of representatives to the Soviets of border regions, provinces, districts, cities, villages, and residential areas. Citizens of other Union Republics will also hold elections on the 24th. On this day, in the entire Russian Federation Republic, 800,000 representatives were elected to local Soviets at all levels. A week later, a total of 1.5 million representatives were elected to 83,573 local Soviets at all levels throughout the Soviet Union.

　　In Moscow, the morning bell of the Kremlin rang six times, and people braved the biting morning wind and walked on the icy and snowy ground towards the polling stations. The first polling station in the Stalin Electoral District that we visited was crowded with hundreds of voters before 6:00 AM. They all wanted to be the first to vote for Stalin and the candidates of the Party and non-Party alliance. Later, the chairman of the election committee, Kudryasheva, obtained everyone's consent, and Izosimov cast the first vote. Izosimov is a famous Stakhanovite worker at the Electric Factory. He had already completed the production quota for the 24 years after the war before election day. In order to welcome this election, he completed the production quota for the 25th year.

　　In the corridor-shaped polling station, a steady stream of people took out their citizen certificates, received ballots from the election committee working group, and then went to a row of six election rooms with velvet curtains to independently select the candidates they approved of, and then put the ballots into the ballot box. Each voter received three ballots, a green one to elect the Oblast Soviet representative, the candidate being Stalin; a white one to elect the City Soviet representative, the candidate being Ivanov; and a gray one to elect the District Soviet representative, with five candidates, four of whom were women and three were non-Party members. By 11:30 AM, 90% of all registered voters at the polling station had voted. The chairman of the election committee, Kudryasheva, told reporters: "The working people in many places have sent telegrams to congratulate the election in the Stalin Electoral District. In order to vote for Stalin, many voters have come to Moscow from the Far East, from Tashkent, and from Tbilisi. Travelers passing through Moscow have come here to vote."

　　We also visited the second polling station in the same district, which was larger and equally crowded. Before 6:00 AM, more than 100 voters were waiting. The first voter was Panfilov, a student at an art school, who had been waiting since 12:00 the night before. As of 10:15 AM, this polling station, which had 2,300 voters, had more than 400 out-of-towners coming to vote.——We asked an officer who was receiving a ballot why he came here to vote, "Why?"——Captain Amerzhenkov, who came from the Altai Border Region, was a little surprised, but when he saw that the question was asked by a foreigner, he smiled and said, "To vote for Comrade Stalin!" When he said this, his eyes radiated a special brilliance. People who had voted were already dancing around a band.

　　We also went to the 19th polling station in the "Proletarian District," which, along with the 17th and 18th polling stations, was located in the palace-style cultural palace of the Stalin Automobile Factory. We saw a female worker bring a four- or five-year-old child to the ballot box and ask him to put the ballot she had chosen into the ballot box. Her eyes also radiated the same brilliance as Captain Amerzhenkov. This is love for the motherland, love for the socialist system, love for the Bolshevik Party, and love for the great Stalin. This love is concentrated in the unanimous election of candidates of the Party and non-Party alliance.

　　在莫斯科斯大林选举区
    ——记苏联地方苏维埃选举
    李何  独伊
    一、人民心坎里的话
    苏联举行地方苏维埃选举（一九五○年十二月十七日）的前几天，莫斯科斯大林选区的选民像苏联许多地方的人民一样，心里都奔腾着一种感情：等待着亲自投票选举斯大林和共产党员与非共产党员联盟的其他候选代表。这种感情表现着苏联社会主义社会的强大力量之一——苏联人民的精神和政治上的一致。
    苏联人民亲密地团结在布尔什维克党和斯大林周围，为和平事业、为共产主义建设而奋斗的精神，特别生动地表现在迎接选举的忘我劳动中，表现在选举前各种会议的热烈演说中，表现在选民与候选代表的诚挚谈话中，表现在选民写给鼓动站的动人的书信中。这些普通选民也常常把自己的情感写成朴素的诗歌，拿真理报的话来说：“这是真正人民心坎里的话。”
    千万苏联选民心坎上共同的一句话，是：“我们投斯大林的票，就是投我们人民的幸福的票，投我们快乐的生活的票，投世界持久和平的票。”在选举的时候，他们歌唱着生活与幸福，像电灯泡工厂女检查员亚比林娜的诗所写的：“祖国伟大而美丽，终年繁荣着黄金的春天，从无边的田野，从巨大的城市，幸福的歌声来自四方八面。”也像谢尔巴科夫纺织工厂女工马林金娜所歌唱的：“我们的孩子在幸福地长大，我们未来的日子就在他们身上。我们也知道：世界上没有别的地方生活得更美好愉快。”
    二、选民和候选代表的会面
    一九五○年十二月十日晚上七点十五分，在莫斯科斯大林区第一选举分区的鼓动站，我们看到了选民和候选代表会面的情形。
    这个选举分区有选民二千五百名。和全斯大林区的选民一样，他们有自己的莫斯科州苏维埃候选代表，莫斯科市苏维埃候选代表和莫斯科斯大林区区苏维埃的候选代表。到选举日选举人要同时投三种选票。
    鼓动站设在电气工厂街一间工厂俱乐部的大厅里。正面墙上交叉挂着几面劳动竞赛的优胜红旗，衬托出列宁浮雕像和斯大林铜像。像的两旁是两幅红布标语，写着：“世界上最民主的宪法的创造者、共产主义胜利的鼓舞者和组织者——斯大林万岁！”“地方苏维埃选举是苏维埃人民精神政治一致的新的强有力的检阅！”两边墙上挂着联共中央政治局委员们的画像及选举条例等。房屋正中安放着长桌，到会的人围着桌子团团坐下。
    七点十五分钟，鼓动站主任维克斯列尔宣布开会。他说：“莫斯科州苏维埃的第一位候选代表是斯大林。这件事已引起了全区劳动人民的生产高潮。”接着他介绍了市苏维埃候选代表伊凡诺夫和大家会面，由受委托的介绍人克列瓦金向大家介绍了伊凡诺夫的生平与社会活动。
    伊凡诺夫是被第六十八选举区变压器工厂的选民首先提名的。他于一九○五年生于顿巴斯的工人家庭，十二岁就到矿里当学徒，一九二六年到莫斯科电气工厂当粗工，后来当铁匠。一九二七年到二九年在红军中服务，一九二八年加入共产党。后来又回到电气工厂所属的变压器工厂，由于卓越的劳动当了生产组组长、铸铁车间间长。他有经验、有知识和组织能力，一九三七年当变压器工厂厂长，善于经营并且关心工人职员的要求。在他的领导下，工厂出产了新型的变压器，得到了列宁勋章和劳动红旗勋章。伊凡诺夫在工人中威信很高，一九三九年被选为区苏维埃代表，一九四五年担任区苏维埃主席，一九四七年被选为莫斯科市苏维埃代表。他是联共斯大林区党委员会常委，莫斯科市苏维埃的地方工业部部长和公用事业委员会主席。他曾得过七个勋章和四个奖章。
    介绍后有五个选民起来发表意见。他们一致表示了对斯大林的爱戴，和对候选代表伊凡诺夫的信任。在工厂工作了三十五年的五十八岁女工杜鲁梭娃说：她在沙皇时代是文盲，现在在政治研究组学习，已经有七年级的文化水平了。她的一个女儿是会计师，另一个女儿是药剂师，一个儿子是车间长。杜鲁梭娃曾经听过斯大林一九三七年十二月十一日在最高苏维埃选举日的演说，她说：斯大林同志当时说过，苏维埃代表应当珍视人民的信托，并忠诚为人民服务。她认为伊凡诺夫正是这样的人。和伊凡诺夫一起作过二十二年工的变压器工厂工人白高夫斯基着重指出伊凡诺夫当车间长时，车间就成为先进的车间。当厂长时，工厂就成为先进的工厂。当区苏维埃主席时，曾迅速地解决了居民的要求，给几乎全区都装置了煤气管。他希望伊凡诺夫领导本区成为先进的一区。第三工厂女工卡尔什诺娃，在第三工厂做了二十一年工了。她说：“革命前我们没权过问国家大事，而现在斯大林使我们自由讨论自己推选的代表。列宁说过：每个厨娘都要管理国家大事。现在这句话实现了。”这些发言都博得全场的鼓掌。
    伊凡诺夫继起说话。他首先感谢古比雪夫变压器工厂全体人员对他的信任，接着介绍他所参与的莫斯科市建设的成绩说：莫斯科市的地方工业和合作社经营的工业的总产量，已超过了战后五年计划原定额的百分之五十，超过了一九四○年水平百分之九十。最近三年莫斯科市政建设拨款约为九十亿卢布，其中二十五亿卢布用在住宅建筑上，十六亿卢布用在公用事业上，十八亿卢布用在交通运输上。莫斯科市的住宅一九四七年新建了十二万九千平方公尺，一九四八年——二十七万平方公尺，一九四九年——四十万五千平方公尺，一九五○年——五十一万零九百六十平方公尺。一九五一年将建筑七十五万平方公尺。莫斯科正建筑八座大厦。此外，最近三年中花了十五亿卢布，修建了一万五千座房屋。现在每个市民用水量比一九一三年增加了五倍，比一九四○年增加了一倍半。三年来共新建和修理了二百四十一万一千平方公尺的道路。过去四年共种植了一百十三万棵树和五百六十六万棵树苗，建立了一百四十八个街心花园。一九五○年建筑了十五座新校舍，增加了十个新托儿所，十二个新幼稚园。幼稚园名额比一九四七年增加一万三千，托儿所名额增加了四千三百。伊凡诺夫最后表示，作为市苏维埃代表，他将为提高市民的福利而努力。
    伊凡诺夫演说完毕后，选民们便纷纷向他提出各种要求。有的要求加快电气工厂街道和桥梁的修理工作；有的要求增加伊兹买洛沃工人区的电车；有的要求关心本区住屋的修缮；有的要求设立本区托儿医疗所。伊凡诺夫一一接受解答，并号召大家提倡房屋的社会主义保护运动。
    八点二十分，伊凡诺夫和他的一部分选民的会面便愉快地结束了。像苏联的一切集会一样，这个有组织有准备的集会，花的时间不过一小时零五分钟。
    三、投党和非党联盟候选人的票
    一九五○年十二月十七日，千千万万人盼望的日子来到了。这天从早上六点钟到晚上十二点钟，俄罗斯、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、哈萨克、乔治亚、拉脱维亚、立陶宛、爱沙尼亚、卡累利阿——芬兰等加盟共和国年满十八岁的公民，都享受到了世界上最民主的选举权利——普遍、平等、直接、秘密地选举边疆区、州、区、市、乡村及居民区苏维埃代表的权利。其他各加盟共和国的公民，在二十四日也要进行选举。就在这天，全俄罗斯联邦共和国，就有八十万代表被选到各级地方苏维埃去。一周以后，全苏联共有一百五十万代表被选到八万三千五百七十三个各级地方苏维埃去。
    在莫斯科，克里姆林宫的晨钟敲了六下，人们冒着凛冽的晨风，踏着冰雪的土地走向选举站。我们参观的斯大林选举区的第一选举站，在六点钟以前就挤满了几百个选民。他们都想争投选举斯大林和党与非党联盟候选人的第一张票。后来，还是选举委员会主席库得拉雪娃征得大家的同意，由伊佐西莫夫投了第一票。伊佐西莫夫是一位出名的电气工厂的斯塔哈诺夫工作者，他在选举日以前，早就完成了战后二十四年的生产定额，为了迎接这次选举，又完成了第二十五年的生产定额。
    在长廊形的选举站里，川流不息的人们拿出自己的公民证，向选举委员会工作组领取了选票之后，就到一排六间垂着绒幕的选举室里独自选出自己认可的候选人，然后把选票投到票箱里。每个选民都领了三张票，一张绿色的，选州苏维埃代表，候选人是斯大林；一张白色的，选市苏维埃代表，候选人是伊凡诺夫；一张灰色的，选区苏维埃代表，候选人有五个，四个是妇女，三个是非党员。到上午十一点三十分，选举站的全部登记选民已经有百分之九十投了票。选举委员会主席库得拉雪娃告诉记者说：“许多地方的劳动人民都打电报来祝贺这儿斯大林选举区的选举。为了投斯大林的票，有许多选民从远东、从塔什干、从第比利斯来到了莫斯科。道经莫斯科的旅客们都到这儿来投票。”
    我们也参观了同区的第二选举站，这个站，较大一些，也同样拥挤。上午六点钟以前，就有一百多选民在等候了。第一个投票者是艺术学校学生潘菲罗夫，他是在头一晚十二点就来等着的。截至上午十时三刻，这个共有二千三百个选民的选举站，就有四百多个外地人来投票。——我们问一位正在领选举票的军官为什么来这儿投票，“为什么？”——这位来自阿尔泰边疆区的亚美尔曾科夫上尉有点惊讶，但他一看发问的是外国人，就笑着说：“为了投斯大林同志的票呀！”说这句话的时候，他的眼睛发射着一种特别的光彩。投过票的人们已经围着一队乐队跳起舞来了。
    我们也到了“无产阶级区”的第十九选举站，它和第十七、第十八选举站都设在斯大林汽车工厂的宫殿式的文化宫里。我们看见一位女工把四五岁大的孩子带到投票箱跟前，叫他把自己选好的票投进票箱去。她的眼睛也发射着跟亚美尔曾科夫上尉一样的光彩。这是对祖国的爱，对社会主义制度的爱，对布尔什维克党的爱，对伟大的斯大林的爱。这种爱就集中表现在一致选举党和非党联盟候选人的上面。
