　　Middle Reaches of Huai River Project Commences Successively
    Dredging of Sui River Fully Underway Since Last Winter
    [From Our Newspaper] Various sections of the Huai River harnessing project in northern Anhui have successively commenced. By late December of last year, over 300,000 laborers had gone to the dikes. Since the Fuyang Special District first carried out typical experimental work on December 5th, more than 120,000 laborers had successively gone to the dikes by around the 25th. The first phase of the Huai River harnessing project in this district has now fully commenced.
    Among them, one of the important dredging projects for fundamentally controlling the Huai River—the Sui River dredging project spanning northeastern Anhui—fully commenced on December 15th and 16th of last year. 230,000 laborers are now overcoming difficulties and intensifying the dredging of this river channel, which has been plagued by floods for many years.
    Simultaneous with the work of over 300,000 laborers on the dikes, the porters of Bengbu City are also wholeheartedly serving the Huai River harnessing project. Under the slogan of "load quickly" and "unload quickly," all workers are working selflessly day and night. According to incomplete statistics for the month of December of last year, a total of more than 700,000 catties of rice, 50,000 catties of salt, nearly 800,000 pieces of cotton clothing, more than 20,000 catties of cotton, more than 35,000 catties of telecommunications equipment, more than 3,000 catties of Western medicine, and other materials such as bamboo poles and reeds have been transported. The wages for transporting materials for the Huai River harnessing project have been determined by the trade union and worker representatives, based on the workers' own opinions, to be one-half of the general wage. The workers' labor enthusiasm is extremely high.

　　淮河中游工程陆续开工
    疏浚濉河工作已于去冬全线展开
    【本报讯】皖北各段治淮工程已陆续开工，到去年十二月下旬已有三十余万民工上堤。阜阳专区自十二月五日首先进行典型实验试工以来，至二十五日左右，已有十二万余民工相继上堤。该区第一期治淮工程至此全面开工。
    其中根治淮河的重要疏浚工程之一——横贯皖东北的濉河疏浚工程已于去年十二月十五、十六日全线开工。二十三万民工现在正排除困难，加紧疏浚这一条连年泛滥成灾的河道。
    与三十余万民工上堤工作同时，蚌埠市的搬运工人也全力为治淮工程服务。全体工人在“快装”、“快卸”的口号下，日夜忘我地工作，据去年十二月一个月来的不完全统计，共已搬运大米七十余万斤，盐五万斤，棉衣近八十万件，棉花二万余斤，电信器材三万五千多斤，西药三千多斤，还有竹杆、芦苇等物资。搬运治淮工程材料的工资经过工会与工人代表们根据工人自己的意见，决定是一般工资的二分之一。工人劳动情绪极高。
