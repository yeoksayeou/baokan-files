　　The Blood and Tears of the Guoluo People Over Thirty Years
　　Shi Linxiang, Zhang Yang

　　Countless historical facts eloquently illustrate a truth: the people will never succumb to the force of reactionary rulers. For thirty years, the Guoluo tribe was not "conquered" or "subdued" by the Ma bandits Bufang and his father through intimidation and slaughter. But today, just one year after the liberation of Qinghai, they are joyfully heading towards the People's Government.

　　Overview

　　The Guoluo are a branch of the nomadic Tibetan people, also known as the Ngolok, mainly distributed in the long area extending from northern Tibet to Qinghai and northern Kham. In Qinghai, the Guoluo people live scattered west of Tongde (Lajia Temple), in the river valleys of the Bayan Har Mountains and Guoluo Mountains at the source of the Yellow River, bordering Sichuan and Kham to the southeast and the Yushu Twenty-Five Tribes to the west, living purely by herding cattle and sheep. This ethnic group has been resisting the bloody aggression of the ruling class for hundreds of years, especially in the last thirty years. The entire history is filled with blood and tears. According to historical records, as early as the Yongzheng period of the Qing Dynasty, there was a desire to enslave this tribe. Nian Gengyao requested that "Yue Zhongqi launch a surprise attack on forty-odd villages of the tribe, capturing many prisoners." Since the Jiaqing and Daoguang periods, troops had been used several times, but such bloody suppression and conquest did not weaken the Guoluo tribe's will to resist. Since the Republic of China, the persecution of the Guoluo tribe by the Ma bandits Bufang and his father has been even more brutal than that of previous reactionary ruling classes. Of course, the Guoluo tribe's resistance to them has also been more intense. The crimes of the Ma bandits are forever remembered by the Guoluo people, and the day of reckoning is finally coming!

　　Slaughter Cannot Conquer the Guoluo Tribe

　　In 1920, Ma Qi, the father of the Ma bandit Bufang, the "Gansu Border Ninghai Garrison Commander," because the Guoluo tribe failed to submit and allow him to dominate and plunder, sent troops to "suppress" them, brutally killing countless people and looting livestock. But this tribe was not intimidated. They still drove their cattle and sheep, carried their tents and steel guns, and fought a desperate and unyielding struggle. When it came to the time of the Ma bandit Bufang, he always regretted that this piece of fat could not fall into his hands, so he resolutely inherited the mantle of his "father"; he still schemed day and night on how to include them under his bestial hooves. According to many villagers, the Ma bandit Bufang used troops against the Guoluo tribe eight times, each time exhausting his ability to cruelly slaughter, plunder, and loot, but each time the response he received was not obedient surrender, but heroic resistance. An old Guoluo man named Danqi, aged fifty-one, who had participated in previous battles, remembered very clearly the Ma bandits' cruel persecution of them: In ×× year, the eighty bandit soldiers sent by the Ma bandits to live in Kang'ergan were insatiably exploiting them, bestially ravaging their wives and daughters, and beatings and scoldings became extremely common. "Who has no parents, sisters?" They could not endure it any longer. The people of the entire Kang'ergan united and wiped out this group of bandits who had been inserted into their hearts. Of course, the Ma bandit Bufang was unwilling to accept this. Ma Desheng and Ma Laowu led extremely vicious bandit troops and marched towards Guoluo. The Guoluo people in Kang'ergan, Kunggan, and other places rose up heroically to resist, just as they had resisted previous rulers who had attempted to conquer them, inflicting extremely painful blows on the bandit troops, but the losses and disasters were also great. A young man named Labu Zuli sadly described the situation at the time. Labu Zuli was originally also from the Guoluo tribe. He is now twenty years old. Ten years ago (1940), when the Ma bandits attacked Kang'ergan and other places, he was only ten years old. His father was killed, his sister was killed, and he and his mother, aunt, and three other family members were taken to Huangyuan by the bandit troops. For the past ten years, his entire family has been working as unpaid laborers for a henchman of the Ma bandits. He cited two shocking examples that he witnessed, illustrating the Ma bandits' brutal crimes at the time: the precious ornaments on the ears of the Guoluo people were cut off with their ears, and the rings on their fingers were chopped off with their fingers. Of the hundreds of people captured, almost all were killed on the road, along with tens of thousands of cattle, sheep, and horses. This twenty-year-old young man is a witness to the entire history of the Ma bandits' persecution of the Guoluo tribe.

　　Economic Blockade

　　When the Ma bandits repeatedly failed to conquer the Guoluo tribe through slaughter and became enraged, they resorted to another despicable method: blockade. Not only were the Guoluo tribe's products—wool, ghee, cowhide, etc.—frozen in the Guoluo area, becoming waste, but no Hui or Han merchants were allowed to trade with the Guoluo people, and those who did were punished. Therefore, the lives of the Guoluo people over the past thirty years have been a blood-soaked history of the Ma bandit Bufang (including Ma Qi) persecuting ethnic minorities.

　　The area inhabited by the Guoluo people is a year-round snow-covered area. Their daily necessities and food completely rely on exchanging cattle and sheep products with the outside world. Since the Ma bandits used economic blockades to persecute them for thirty years, they dared not and could not go to the "inland" (referring to Huangyuan, Xining). Large quantities of wool and cowhide were blocked and became waste. Occasionally, they would go to Ganzi and Nawa, but because they were too far away and the sales were not smooth, it often did not add up (one hundred catties of wool could only be exchanged for fifty catties of flour). Therefore, for the past thirty years, their economic life (not to mention political and cultural life) has been in a state of extreme poverty. A Guoluo compatriot told us: In those years, they looked eastward at the clouds and mountains, daring to look but not daring to approach, and hated the sight of wool—hating that it could not alleviate their poverty. There was once such a thing: When there was really no other way, one "Dewa" (village) risked transporting more than two hundred pack animals of wool to Xining to exchange for living materials. As a result, the wool was confiscated by "Baixinghai" (De Xinghai), and they had to secretly sell part of their cattle for travel expenses to return.

　　果洛人民三十年的血泪
    石麟祥  张扬
    无数的历史事实，雄辩地说明一个真理：人民决不会屈服于反动统治者的武力的。果洛部落三十年来，被马匪步芳和他的老子，用威吓屠杀的办法，没有“征服”、“就范”。但青海解放短短一年后的今天，欢乐地奔向了人民政府。
    概况
    果洛，为游牧藏族的一个支派，亦称俄罗族，主要分布在从西藏北部一直延伸到青海和康北的绵长地区内。在青海的果洛人，散居于同德（拉加寺）以西，黄河源头的巴颜喀喇山与果洛山脉的河谷一带，东南毗界川、康；西接玉树二十五族，纯以畜牧牛羊为生。这个民族，在数百年来，尤其近三十年来，一直在反抗着统治阶级的血腥侵略，整个的历史充满了血和泪，据史载：在清初雍正，即欲奴役该部，年羹尧奏请以“岳钟琪奇袭该部寨四十余处，擒获甚丰”，嘉庆道光以来也曾数度用兵，但是这样的血腥镇压与征服，并没有减弱果洛部反抗的意志。民国以来，马匪步芳和他的父亲，对于果洛部的迫害，更比历代反动统治阶级野蛮了。当然，果洛部对他们的反抗亦更剧烈。马匪的罪恶，果洛人永远记忆着，血债清算的日子终于就要到来！
    杀戮征服不了果洛部
    一九二零年，马匪步芳之父——“甘边宁海镇守使”马麒，因果洛部未能俯首驯服，听任他的宰割与搜刮，乃发兵“讨伐”，虐杀人命与掳掠牲畜不可数计。但是这个部族，没有被吓倒，他们仍然赶着自己的牛羊，携带着自己的帐篷、钢枪快马作着殊死不屈的斗争。到了马匪步芳时候，每思这块肥肉不能落到手里为憾，于是毅然继承了“乃翁”的衣钵；仍然对果洛部日谋夜虑的策筹着如何囊括到他的兽蹄下。据不少老乡传说，马匪步芳曾经对果洛族八次用兵，每一次都极尽残酷地杀戮与掠夺洗劫之能事，但每一次得到的回响，不是恭顺的降服，而是英勇的反抗斗争。一个五十一岁的果洛老汉丹旗，他曾经参加过历次战斗，他对于马匪对他们的惨酷迫害，记得很清楚：××年的时候。马匪派住在康尔干的八十个匪兵，无餍地压榨着他们，野兽般的蹂躏他们的妻女，打骂成为极其寻常的事情。“谁无父母姊妹”他们不能忍受下去，全康尔干的人民团结起来，一举消灭了这一股插在他们心脏的匪兵。当然马匪步芳是不甘心的，马得胜、马老五，率领穷凶极恶的匪军，大举指向果洛，康尔干、昆干等地的果洛人民，像他们反抗历次妄想征服他们的统治者一样的英勇起来对抗，给予匪军以极痛的打击，但损失和灾害也是很大的。一个叫做喇布足力的青年，沉痛地描述了当时情形。喇布足力原来也是果洛人，他今年整二十岁，十年前（一九四○年），马匪进攻康尔干等地时，他还是才满十岁的小孩子，父亲被杀了，姐姐被杀了，他和他的母亲、姨娘等五口人，被匪军掳到湟源来，这十年的日子，他的全家是给马匪的一个爪牙作着无偿的劳役。他举了两件亲目所见的惨不忍闻的事例，说明马匪当时惨暴罪行：果洛人耳朵上的珍贵首饰是连耳割下，手上的戒指连指砍下，掳下来的人，约数百，路上残杀殆尽，马牛羊数万头。这一个二十岁的青年，便是马匪迫害果洛部整个历史的见证。
    经济封锁
    当马匪屡次屠杀征服不了果洛，而老羞成怒的时候，他卑鄙的采用了另一种办法：封锁。不但果洛部的出产——羊毛、酥油、牛皮等封冻在果洛区，成为弃货，而且不许任何回汉商人，与果洛人民来往，有来往者，即以论罪。因此这三十年来的果洛人生活是一部马匪步芳（包括马麒）迫害少数民族的血史。
    果洛人所住的地区，是常年积雪的地带。其日用必需品及粮食完全依靠牛羊产品与外面交换，自从马匪用经济封锁迫害他们三十年来，他们不敢也不能到“内地”（指湟源、西宁），大批的羊毛，牛皮被杜塞着成为废货，偶尔也到甘孜、那瓦去，但由于太远和销路不畅，往往算不过账（百斤羊毛、只换五十斤面），因此三十年来他们的经济生活（政治、文化当然不用提了）陷于极端贫困的境地。一个果洛同胞，告诉我们说：那几年他们东望云山，敢望而不敢近，看见羊毛就恨。——恨它不能解救他们的贫困。曾经有过这样的事情：在实在没有办法的时候，有一个“德哇”（村庄）冒险运着二百多驮子羊毛到西宁来换取生活资料，结果羊毛被“百姓害”（德兴海）没收了，只得偷偷卖掉一部分牛作盘费转回去。
