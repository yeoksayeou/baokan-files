　　At 6:30 a.m. on September 28th of last year, the reactionary Japanese government, under the orders of MacArthur, mobilized more than 300 police officers to illegally seal up the "Overseas Chinese People's Daily," founded by our overseas Chinese in Tokyo. This act of violence by the American and Japanese reactionaries, depriving overseas Chinese in Japan of their freedom of speech, aroused boundless anger among our overseas Chinese in Japan, who lodged a strong protest with the Japanese government. The picture shows the situation on the day the Japanese government's Special Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Justice and the Metropolitan Police Department illegally closed down the newspaper, confiscated newspapers, ledgers, documents, and books.

    去年九月二十八日清晨六时半，日本反动政府奉麦克阿瑟之令，动员警察三百余人，将我留日侨胞在东京创办的“华侨民报”非法查封。美日反动派剥夺在日华侨言论自由的这一暴行，引起我留日侨胞无比的愤怒，他们曾向日本政府提出坚强抗议。图示：当日日本政府法务府特别审查局及警视厅非法封闭该报、没收报纸、账簿、文件及书籍等的情形。
