To the Editor:

　　Since returning from the National Model Workers' Representative Conference in Beijing last year, the North Sichuan Administrative Office has assigned me to do propaganda work in various counties. Of the eleven counties I was assigned to propagate in, only three had roads accessible to vehicles. The remaining eight counties required walking, especially between Pingchang, Daxian, and Yuechi counties, which are full of high mountains and steep ridges, with roads winding up and down for more than ten *li*, making travel difficult. In over forty days, I traveled through three special commissioner's offices, eleven county governments, nine district governments, twelve township governments, and two cotton farms, holding meetings with a total of more than 20,000 people. About 80% of those attending the meetings were male and female representatives from various rural units. At each meeting, I conveyed in detail Chairman Mao's instructions, the instructions of the central leaders, and the spirit of the National Model Workers' Representative Conference. In particular, the experience of farmers in the old liberated areas organizing themselves to develop production was introduced in detail to every rural area. The farmers all proposed conditions to ensure increased production this year.

　　When I arrived in each county, I was warmly welcomed and seen off by the masses. Especially on the streets, every household hung the five-star red flag fluttering in the wind; the people's ranks cheered; and the slogans of "Support Chairman Mao's wise leadership" resounded through the clouds. All these sights and sounds are sufficient to prove that Chairman Mao's radiance has shone into the deep mountain villages of southwestern China.

　　The righteous actions of the Chinese People's Volunteers in Korea have further aroused the enthusiasm of the broad masses of people in northern Sichuan to resist America, aid Korea, and defend our homes and country.

　　Liu Yueting, Representative to the National Model Workers' Representative Conference, Farmer of Hejiagou Village, Shehong County, Sichuan

　　我把毛主席的话带到四川深山里编辑同志：
    自从去年在北京开完劳动模范代表会议回来以后，川北区行政公署就派我到各县做宣传工作。在我担任宣传的十一个县份中，只有三个县通车，其余八县均要步行，特别是平昌、达县、岳池三县之间，尽是高山峻岭，一上一下十余里，道路崎岖难行。走了四十多天，共走了三个专员公署、十一个县政府，九个区政府，十二个乡政府，两个棉场，前后开会人数达二万余人，出席会议的人有十分之八的人是农村各个单位的男女代表。在每一处开会时，我都将毛主席、中央各首长的指示，及全国劳动模范代表会议的精神，详细地作了传达。特别是老解放区农民组织起来发展生产的经验，都详尽的介绍到每个农村去了。农民们对今年的生产都提出来保证增产的条件。
    到各县时，都受到了群众们热烈的欢迎欢送，特别是在街道上，家家户户挂着的五星红旗在迎风飘扬；人民的队伍欢声四起；“拥护毛主席的英明领导”的口号声响彻云霄。这一切所见所闻的情况，足以证明毛主席的光芒，照耀到了西南的深山农村。
    我国人民志愿军在朝鲜的正义行动，更激起了川北广大人民的抗美援朝保家卫国的热情。
