A Revolutionary Soldier's Family's Letter to Their Son
    Wanrong, my son:
    I have received your letter and the revolutionary soldier's certificate. Knowing that you are now taller, eating well, and weigh 117 pounds, your mother and I are so happy we can't stop smiling!
    You couldn't write letters before, but this time, receiving your handwritten letter makes me very happy. You must study hard and strive for progress. These good things are brought to us by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. You must never forget Chairman Mao's kindness.
    Our family is very different this year compared to previous years. Not counting the sorghum and millet, just take the one *tian di* (ten *mu*) of cotton as an example, it's blooming like popcorn, and we can pick at least over 1,000 *jin*. This year's harvest alone is enough for our family of three to eat and drink for three years.
    The government also takes good care of us, solving any difficulties we have. The land the masses contracted to us has been weeded and tilled four times each in a timely manner this year, so the crops are growing very well. Your younger brother has already started school. Your mother and I are engaged in production at home. We calculated that this year we'll use the remaining grain to buy a big ox, and with our existing mule, we'll be able to plow the fields ourselves next year, so we won't need the government's help. We must strive to be model military dependents next year. I hope you will work hard to perform meritorious service for the people and complete all the tasks Chairman Mao has given you.
              Father, Tao Mingshan
          December, 1950
        (Military Dependent of Wu Lianggucun Village, Heishan County, Liaoxi Province)

### 革命军人家属写给儿子的信

　　革命军人家属写给儿子的信万荣儿：
    你的来信和革命军人证明书都接到了。知道你现在长的又高、吃的又胖，体重一百一十七斤；我和你妈都乐得闭不上嘴啦！
    以前你不会写信，这回，我接着你的亲笔信，非常高兴。你一定要努力学习，力求进步。这样的好事，是共产党、毛主席给咱们带来的。你千万别忘掉毛主席的恩情。
    咱家今年比往年大有不同。高粱、谷子不算，就拿一天地（十亩）的棉花来说，开得像爆花似的，顶少能捡一千斤以上。今年一年的收成够咱家三口人三年的吃喝。
    政府对咱们照顾得也很周到，有困难就给解决。群众给咱包耕的土地，今年都能及时地做到四铲四趟，所以庄稼长得很好。你弟弟已上学念书了。我和你妈在家生产。我们核计：今年把剩下来的粮食买头大牛，加上咱们原有的一头骡子，明年自己拴犋，就不用政府帮助了。咱们明年一定要争取当模范军属。希望你努力为人民立功，完成毛主席给你的一切任务。
