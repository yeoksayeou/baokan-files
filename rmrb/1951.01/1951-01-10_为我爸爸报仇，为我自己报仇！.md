　　Avenge My Father, Avenge Myself!
    Bi Yaocai
    (Editor's Note: The author is a first-class disabled soldier from the Second Hebei Provincial School for Disabled Revolutionary Soldiers.)
    Dear Father! You were a brave warrior of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, you were an outstanding son of the New China. You participated in battles to annihilate the Japanese invaders and the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. You used your bayonet to pierce through Japanese robbers. Unfortunately, three years ago, you encountered disaster outside Gubeikou. You were killed by a bomb! You were killed by American planes that Truman used to help Chiang Kai-shek fight the civil war!
    Dear Father, you gloriously sacrificed yourself for the revolution, and I—your son—was also gloriously wounded for the revolution. American shells, provided by Truman to help Chiang Kai-shek fight the civil war, shattered my feet, damaged my left hand, and made my eyes unable to see beyond a hundred paces.
    Dear Father, before you died, you told me: "Fight for the revolution to the very end!" Yes, dear Father, I will fight for the revolution to the very end! The blood of thousands of brave warriors has earned today's victory, but the struggle is not over! Truman is still using guns and cannons to slaughter the Korean people, and still using planes to strafe our Northeast, and dispatching warships to invade our Taiwan. From the newspapers, I see these things, and my anger is uncontrollable. I cannot ignore it!
    Dear Father, your revolutionary spirit will live forever! I will listen to you, inherit your unfinished revolutionary cause, avenge you, avenge myself! I cannot go to the front lines, so I will support Korea with practical actions from the rear! Starting in November, I will take five kilograms of rice from my monthly allowance and give it to the newspaper office to forward to our Korean brothers. I will also spend two hours every day doing propaganda work among the masses. I want to make the masses realize that American imperialism is just a paper tiger. I want to do a good job in propaganda work in Dongcun and Licun, Boye City, because propaganda work is also part of the entire movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country.
    Dear Father, rest in peace. I grew up in your embrace and in the embrace of the Party. Although I am disabled for the sake of the revolution, I will never be pessimistic! I will continue to use my hands and my mouth to work for the revolution to the very end!

　　为我爸爸报仇，为我自己报仇！
    毕耀彩
    （编者按：作者是河北省第二荣誉军人学校的一等荣誉军人。）
    亲爱的爸爸！你是中国人民解放军的勇士，你是新中国优秀的儿子，你曾参加过歼灭日寇、蒋匪的战斗，你曾用刺刀把日本强盗刺穿。不幸，三年以前，你在古北口外遭了难，你被炸弹炸死了！你被杜鲁门帮助蒋介石打内战的美国飞机炸死了！
    亲爱的爸爸，你为革命光荣牺牲，我——你的儿子，也为革命光荣的负伤了。杜鲁门帮助蒋介石打内战的美国炮弹，把我双脚炸断，把我左手炸坏，把我的两只眼睛炸得看不到百步远。
    亲爱的爸爸，在死之前，你告诉我：“要为革命奋斗到底！”是的，亲爱的爸爸，我要为革命奋斗到底！千万个勇士的鲜血，换得了今日的胜利，可是，斗争并没有完结！杜鲁门还在用枪炮屠杀朝鲜人民，还在用飞机扫射我们的东北，调派军舰侵略我们的台湾。从报纸上，我看到这些事，我的愤怒不能抑止，我不能不管！
    亲爱的爸爸，你的革命精神永垂不朽！我要听你的话，继承你未完成的革命事业，替你报仇，替我自己报仇！我不能上前线，我就在后方用实际行动支援朝鲜！从十一月份起，每月我从津贴费里抽出五斤米，交给报社，转交给朝鲜兄弟。我每天还要抽出两小时，向广大群众作宣传，我要使广大群众认识美帝不过是纸老虎，我要在我现在的工作岗位上，在博野城的东村和蠡村作好宣传工作，因为宣传工作也是整个抗美援朝保家卫国运动的一部分。
    亲爱的爸爸，你安息吧，我在你的怀抱、党的怀抱里长大，虽然为了革命我残废了，可是我永远不悲观！我还要用我的手、我的口，为革命工作到底！
