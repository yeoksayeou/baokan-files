　　(II) Struggle for the Release of Twenty Japanese Workers Sentenced in the "Matsukawa Incident"
　　On December 6, 1950, the Fukushima Local Court in Fukushima Prefecture, under the rule of the Yoshida reactionary government, a running dog of American imperialism in Japan, sentenced twenty Japanese communists and patriotic workers to various serious crimes under the pretext of the so-called "Matsukawa Train Derailment Incident" that occurred on August 17, 1949. Among them, Nobu Suzuki and four others were sentenced to death; Hisashi Takeda and four others were sentenced to life imprisonment; Chi Saito was sentenced to 15 years in prison; Futao Hamasaki and three others were sentenced to 12 years in prison; Daiji Sato and two others were sentenced to 10 years in prison; Shozo Ouchi and three others were sentenced to 7 years in prison; and Sonoko Nikaido was sentenced to three and a half years in prison. The Chinese people believe that the Japanese Yoshida government's judicial organs' sentencing of Nobu Suzuki and the other twenty people completely violates the Potsdam Proclamation issued by the Allied Powers on July 26, 1945, urging Japan to surrender, and completely violates the Basic Post-Surrender Policy for Japan promulgated by the Far Eastern Commission on June 20, 1947. This verdict clearly indicates the revival of Japanese fascist rule, and thus seriously endangers the basic human rights of the Japanese working class and the Japanese people. This verdict is completely illegal.
　　The "Matsukawa Incident" is obviously fabricated. According to the Yoshida reactionary government's claim: On August 17, 1949, a train derailed at Matsukawa Station in Fukushima, killing three people, with the "evidence" being a "wrench." According to the report submitted by the Fukushima Administration Bureau of the Japanese National Railways to the Sendai Railway Bureau: "A wrench cannot loosen the track spikes pressed tightly with hundreds of tons of force and cause the train to derail." The Yoshida reactionary government used this fundamentally untenable "Matsukawa Incident" as a pretext to sentence twenty outstanding sons and daughters of the Japanese working class and the Japanese people, which is obviously a shameless conspiracy to suppress the increasingly rising democratic movement of the Japanese working class and the Japanese people.
　　The verdict in the "Matsukawa Incident" is not accidental. Such a brutal verdict reflects the fear of American imperialism and Japanese reactionaries. There is no doubt that the crushing defeat of American imperialism in Korea has caused it to lose confidence in its rule over Japan. The prestige of American imperialism among the Japanese people has suffered a fatal blow. The myth that American imperialism cannot be defeated has been completely shattered. In order to maintain their increasingly shaky reactionary rule in Japan, American imperialism and the Japanese reactionary government have intensified their suppression of the Japanese working class and the Japanese people. Following the failure of American imperialism in Korea, they may create more "Matsukawa Incidents."
　　The direct responsibility for the illegal verdict in the "Matsukawa Incident" lies with the Yoshida reactionary government. The Chinese people demand that the Yoshida government pay attention to fulfilling its obligations arising from the Potsdam Declaration and the Far Eastern Commission's Basic Post-Surrender Policy for Japan. Before the Japanese people have chosen a democratic Japanese government based on a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan and according to their own free and independent will, any Japanese government inherited from before the surrender, composed according to the Emperor system and its government form, such as the Yoshida Cabinet, can only be a temporary body for implementing the various provisions of the Potsdam Declaration and the Far Eastern Commission's Post-Surrender Policy for Japan. The Chinese people believe that since Japan's surrender in August 1945, the Japanese government, including the Yoshida Cabinet, has completely failed to fulfill the provisions of the Potsdam Declaration and the Far Eastern Commission's policy towards Japan that promote the democratization of Japan. On the contrary, the Japanese government has completely colluded with American imperialism to restore and strengthen the reactionary rule of Japanese fascism. This is unacceptable to the Chinese people and the people of the world. The Yoshida government should respect the will of the world's people, immediately cancel the verdict of the Fukushima Local Court, and unconditionally release Nobu Suzuki and the other twenty outstanding sons and daughters of the Japanese working class and the Japanese people.

### （二）为“松川事件”中被判刑的二十个日本工人的释放而斗争

　　（二）为“松川事件”中被判刑的二十个日本工人的释放而斗争
    一九五○年十二月六日，美帝国主义在日本的走狗吉田反动政府统治下的福岛县福岛地方裁判所，借口一九四九年八月十七日发生的所谓“松川列车颠覆事件”，判决二十名日本共产党员与爱国工人各种重罪。其中，铃木信等五人判处死刑；武田久等五人判处无期徒刑；斋藤千判处十五年徒刑；滨崎二男等三人判处十二年徒刑；佐藤代治等二人判处十年徒刑；大内昭三等三人判处七年徒刑；二阶堂园子判处三年半徒刑。中国人民认为：日本吉田政府司法机关对于铃木信等二十人的判决，完全违反一九四五年七月二十六日同盟国促令日本投降的波茨坦公告，完全违反远东委员会一九四七年六月二十日公布的对投降后日本的基本政策。这个判决显然表示日本法西斯蒂统治的复活，因而也就严重地危害了日本工人阶级与日本人民的基本人权。这个判决是完全非法的。
    “松川事件”显然是虚构的。据吉田反动政府宣称：一九四九年八月十七日，有一辆火车在福岛松川车站出轨，死亡三人，“罪证”是一个“螺丝钉把”。据日本国营铁路福岛管理局提交仙台铁道局的报告书中说：“一个螺丝钉把，不可能挖动以数百吨力量压紧的道钉，而使列车脱轨”。吉田反动政府借口这个根本不能成立的“松川事件”，即判处了二十个日本工人阶级与日本人民的优秀子弟，显然是借以镇压日本工人阶级和日本人民日益高涨的民主运动的无耻阴谋。
    “松川事件”的判决不是偶然的。这样残暴的判决，反映了美帝国主义和日本反动派的恐惧心理。毫无疑问，美帝国主义在朝鲜的惨败，已使它对于日本的统治，失去了信心。美帝国主义在日本人民中的威信，已受到致命的打击。美帝国主义不可被人打败的神话已经完全破产了。美帝国主义和日本反动政府为了保持其日益动摇的在日本的反动统治，因而就加紧其对于日本工人阶级和日本人民的镇压。随着美帝国主义在朝鲜的失败，他们还可能制造更多的“松川事件”。
    “松川事件”非法判决的直接负责者是吉田反动政府。中国人民要求吉田政府注意履行其由波茨坦宣言与远东委员会对投降后日本的基本政策而来的义务。在日本人民还没有根据全面对日和约，根据他们自己的自由独立的意志，选择一个民主的日本政府之前，任何由投降前因袭下来的，按照天皇制度及其政府形式而组成的日本政府，像吉田内阁之类的政府，都只能是为了执行波茨坦宣言以及远东委员会对投降后日本的基本政策各项条款而临时存在的机构。中国人民认为：自从一九四五年八月日本投降以来，日本政府，包括吉田内阁在内，完全没有履行波茨坦宣言以及远东委员会对投降后日本的政策中促成日本民主化的规定。恰恰相反，日本政府却完全与美帝国主义勾结起来，恢复并加强了日本法西斯蒂的反动统治。这是中国人民和全世界人民所不能容许的。吉田政府应当尊重世界人民的意志，应当立即取消福岛地方裁判所的判决，对于铃木信等二十名日本工人阶级与日本人民的优秀子弟予以无条件的释放。
