Reading "Several Questions About Books"

Hu Yuzhi

The "New Construction" Volume 3, Issue 4, published an article by Mr. Xiang Da entitled "Several Questions About Books." As the author stated, this article only raises questions from the perspective of a book's form, which are related to the form of book printing, and does not involve the "good or bad content of the book." However, today, this issue of the form of book printing is the most overlooked by our publishing workers. Therefore, Mr. Xiang's article raises many opinions on this aspect, which are extremely beneficial to publishing workers.

In terms of the quality of book content, our publishing industry has made great progress since liberation. Generally, the books currently published are much more serious and earnest than those published during the reactionary rule. Yellow, poisonous books and periodicals have been rejected by readers and are gradually disappearing from the market. However, in terms of form, our publishing industry has not progressed; in many aspects, it has regressed, or at least temporarily regressed. Currently published books, in terms of cover, binding, typesetting, illustrations, proofreading, and paper quality, have not only stagnated with little improvement but are even inferior to the books published by a few large bookstores before the War of Resistance.

The lack of attention to the form of books is a temporary phenomenon, and there are reasons to explain it. Firstly, the long-term war and rural living environment did not allow for too much attention to form. Secondly, the current readership has changed; books are no longer playthings for a few idle classes but have become the spiritual food of the masses. On the one hand, the demand for books has increased; on the other hand, the purchasing power of readers is low. Therefore, publishers only seek to reduce printing costs and supply in large quantities, unable to consider the refinement and aesthetics of books.

In addition to these reasons, there is another important reason: our publishing workers only value the content of books and almost completely ignore their form. Some publishing workers mechanically understand the political tasks of publishing work and believe that the quality of book printing, the beauty of binding, the correctness of proofreading, etc., are purely technical issues and not worth paying attention to.

Is form really not worth paying attention to? Not at all. Form has a counter-effect on content. As Mr. Xiang said: "Readers who look at a book may often have their courage to continue reading reduced because of a poorly designed cover, etc. A good initial impression of a book's cover is a good initial impression of the entire book."

Absolutely right. A good book should be a complete work of art. A good book must have its ideological content, text, illustrations, punctuation, line spacing, typesetting style, cover, and binding all coordinated in a balanced and appropriate manner. The content and form of a book should be consistent, expressing the book's unique style, only then can it truly be considered a good book.

Conversely, a valuable work that is poorly typeset and printed, carelessly proofread, and whose cover, illustrations, etc., are not commensurate with the content of the book is a waste of the work itself, an insult to the author, and an irresponsible attitude towards readers.

Lu Xun always proofread his own works and those of some friends, and designed the cover and binding himself. He was never careless about the form of books. Soviet book review magazines always publish copperplate prints of the cover design when introducing each new book, also to emphasize the style of a book's binding.

Not only should every good book have its unique style, but every serious publisher generally maintains a style that is unique to them in terms of the form of the books they publish. It can even be said that every nation with a high level of culture has a unique national style in terms of the form of the books they publish, which is the national form of books.

We do not advocate maintaining the old national form of books—the thread-bound book form. However, we must start now to create a new national form of books. That is to say, the version style, punctuation, line spacing, illustrations, binding, and even paper and ink, must have certain specifications and conform to a sentiment that the Chinese people are accustomed to, rather than simply imitating the style of foreign books without doing it well.

I've digressed too far. My intention is simply to hope that our publishing workers will pay more attention to the form of book printing and strive for improvement. Therefore, Mr. Xiang's article is indeed enlightening for our publishing workers in this regard.

Many of the issues raised by Mr. Xiang are the responsibility of the General Administration of Publications. Now I will offer some opinions on these issues for Mr. Xiang to correct, and also for the reference of publishing workers nationwide.

Regarding the cover, I completely agree with Mr. Xiang's view. The cover design should match the content of the book, just as clothes should match a person's figure. Our editors often do not care much about cover design, and our artists often do not regard designing covers and illustrations as an important artistic task. Unless this situation is corrected, it will be difficult to improve the cover of books. Not only should the cover have an appropriate design, but the font of the title on the cover should not be careless. Some books even have patterns and words printed on the cover that are difficult to recognize at first glance, which is completely unacceptable.

Of course, the cover, binding, and printing should not only pursue aesthetics but also pay attention to practicality and economy. For the benefit of the majority of readers, book printing should be practical and not too expensive, which is necessary. However, taking into account practicality and economy, it is still possible to achieve beauty, and beauty does not always require spending money.

The copyright page should have a fixed format, with the names of the author and translator, the original title of the translated work, and especially the source of the edition (first edition or reprint), and the year and month of publication, clearly indicated. This was decided at the National Publishing Conference last year. Most of the new books published recently have already implemented this decision. Recently, it was discovered that old books reprinted after liberation deliberately had "first edition" printed on the copyright page, misleading readers into thinking they were new books compiled and printed after liberation. I hope publishers will pay attention to this and make corrections if there are such cases.

Regarding the line spacing and font size of books, there are indeed situations like the one Mr. Xiang mentioned. Because publishers want to reduce costs, the font size is getting smaller and smaller, and the line spacing is getting denser and denser, which not only detracts from the aesthetics but also damages the eyesight of young people and children. In the Soviet Union, books are published with specific specifications for font size and line spacing. The General Administration of Publications is studying and preparing to separately stipulate the font to be used and the number of lines and words per page according to the nature and target audience of the books. As for including the name of the proofreader on the copyright page, the Commercial Press used to have this practice, which is worth promoting.

The problem of paper used for books will not be easily solved in one or two years. We still have to use single-sided, extremely rough newsprint to print books. This is because our papermaking industry has not yet fully developed, and the paper quality is poor and the cost is high. If we import a large amount of foreign paper, the domestic papermaking industry will never be able to develop. Therefore, we have to temporarily endure the current situation in terms of paper. As for Mr. Xiang's proposal that specialized works and books that can be circulated for a long time should be printed in a small number of deluxe editions, in addition to the popular editions, for the needs of book collectors and libraries, this suggestion is very good, and I hope the publishing industry will adopt it.

Mr. Xiang hopes that the cover should be made of thicker paper and the binding should be firm in order to extend the life of the book. This is very correct. Our binding technology is too backward. Generally, books are bound with iron wire, which is not only easy to fall apart but also inconvenient to browse. Mr. Xiang advocates using other metal wire instead of iron wire, but this is not a solution. To make the binding firm and not easy to fall apart, only the center-sewn thread binding method can be used. Our country currently lacks the machinery and equipment in this area, and there are too few skilled workers. I hope that general printing factories will purchase more thread-sewing machines and train more skilled thread-sewing workers.

The current book advertisements do need to be improved. Not only can book advertisements be placed in newspapers and periodicals, but there should also be book advertisements in bookstores and many public places. A simple book list is not enough; a brief description of the content must be added. Book advertisements in other countries often quote text from book reviews, and we can also adopt this method.

The General Administration of Publications is already compiling and publishing a general catalog of newly compiled and published books. It is hoped that the general catalog for 1950 will be compiled and published by the spring.

We strongly agree that book reviews should indicate the total number of pages, edition, and price of the book, and we hope that book reviewers and newspapers and periodicals that publish book reviews will pay attention to this. We ask that all newspapers and periodicals set up book review columns to make book review work a major bridge connecting authors, publishers, and readers. Regarding this point, the General Administration of Publications and the News Administration are preparing to issue a special instruction recently, and I am mentioning it here in passing, hoping that newspapers and periodicals across the country will implement it as quickly as possible.

Mr. Xiang also proposed that after each book is printed, a horizontally printed name slip should be included, printed with the book title, author's name, number of pages, edition, etc., for libraries to use as catalog cards. This suggestion is very good. The difficulty is that the library classification method has not yet been unified. If each publisher prints the name slips themselves, the size, style, and arrangement of items will not be consistent, so it will not be very useful for libraries, but it may not be necessary for general readers. In the Soviet Union, the national library catalog cards are uniformly compiled, printed, and sold to various libraries by the Central Library, which greatly helps library work. The National Peking Library has already started working on this.

### 读了“关于书的几个问题”

　　读了“关于书的几个问题”
    胡愈之
    “新建设”三卷四期发表了向达先生所著“关于书的几个问题”这一篇文章。正如作者所说，这篇文章只是从一本书的形态来提问题，这就是和书的印制的形式有关的一些问题，其中并没有涉及“书的内容的好坏”问题。但是在今天，也就是这个书的印制的形式问题，最为我们出版工作者所漠视。因此，向先生在这篇文章里提出了关于这个方面的许多意见，对于出版工作者是极其有益的。
    从书的内容好坏来说，解放以后，我们的出版界是大有进步了。目前出版的书，一般都比反动统治时代出版的书要严肃得多，要认真得多。黄色的有毒的书刊已经被读者所厌弃，逐渐从市场消失。可是，从形态上来看，我们的出版界却并没有前进，在许多方面还有后退，至少是暂时的后退。目前出版的书，在封面、装帧、排版、插图、校对以及用纸方面，不但停顿着很少改进，而且甚至还比不上抗战前几家大书店所出版的书。
    书籍不讲究形式，是暂时的现象，是有理由可以解释的。首先，在长期的战争和农村的生活环境中，不容许太讲究形式。其次，现在的读者群已经有了改变，书籍不再成为少数有闲阶级的赏玩品，而成为人民大众的精神食粮了。一方面书的需要量增加，另一方面读者的购买力低。所以出版家只求减低印制成本，大量供应，不能从书的精制和美观这方面去考虑。
    除了这些原因以外，还有另一个重要原因，那就是我们的出版工作者，只重视书的内容，几乎完全忽略了书的形式。一部分出版工作者机械地理解出版工作的政治任务，就以为书的印制的好坏，装帧的美观，校对的正确等等，是纯粹技术问题，是不值得重视的。
    形式真是不值得重视吗？完全不然。形式对内容是有反作用的。诚如向先生所说：“读者看一本书，往往可因封面等等设计不好，便减少了对一本书看下去的勇气。读者对于一本书的封面印象好，就是对于一本书的全体最初印象好。”
    完全对。一本好书，应当是一件完整的艺术品。一本好书，一定是思想内容，文字插图，标点行格，排版式样，封面装帧都是配合得很匀称，很恰当的。书的内容和形式要能求得一致，表达出一本书的独特的风格，这样才真正算得一本好书。
    相反地，一本很有价值的著作，却排印得很坏，校对得很马虎，封面、插图等等和书的内容都不相称，这是糟蹋了那本著作的本身，侮辱了那本书的作者，同时对读者是采取了不负责的态度。
    鲁迅对于自己的著作和有些朋友的著作，总是爱自己校对，自己设计封面装帧，在书的形式上头，他是从不马虎的。苏联的书评杂志介绍每一本新书，总是把书的封面图案制成铜版刊出，也为的是重视一本书的装帧上的风格。
    不但每一本好书都应当有它的独特的风格，每一个认真的出版家，对于所出版的书的形式，一般都保持一种他所特有的风格。甚至可以说，每一个具有高度文化的民族，所出版的书在形式方面都有独特的民族风格，也就是书的民族形式。
    我们并不主张保持书的旧民族形式——线装书的形式。可是我们必须从现在起，创造一种书的民族新形式。这就是说版本式样，标点行格，插图装帧，甚至纸张印墨，都要有一定的规格，并且要符合于中国人民所习惯的一种情调，而不是随便模仿外国书的式样而又没有模仿好。
    话扯得太远了。我的意思无非是希望我们出版工作者对于书的印制的形式要多加注意，力求改进。因此，向先生这篇文章，在这一方面，对于我们出版工作者，确实是有启发作用的。
    向先生所提出的问题，有许多是出版总署应当负责的。我现在对这些问题，说一些意见，请向先生指正，同时也供全国出版工作者参考。
    关于封面，我完全同意向先生的看法。封面图案设计要配合书的内容，也正像衣服要配合人的身段。我们的编辑工作者往往不大关心封面设计，我们的艺术家也往往不把设计封面图案和插图当作一件重要的艺术工作。这种情形不纠正过来，书的封面总难得搞好。不但封面要有适当的图案设计，封面上的题目字体也不应当马虎。有的书，封面上印的图案字，甚至一时不容易认出来，这完全要不得。
    当然，封面、装帧和印刷，不应当只是求美观，不注意到实用和经济。为了读者大众的利益，书的印制要适合于实用，并且不太花费，这是必要的。但是照顾到实用和经济，仍然是可做到美观的，美观有时也不一定要花费钱才做得到。
    版权页应有一定格式，著者、译者姓名、译著的原书名，特别是版本的来源（初版或重版），出版的年月，必须详细标明。这一层，去年全国出版会议已作出了决议。近来出版的新书，大部分也已经执行了这一决议。最近发现解放后重版印行的旧书在版权页上有故意印作初版的，使读者误认为是解放后编印的新书。希望出版家注意，如有这一类的事，应声明改正。
    关于书的行格和字体大小，确实有像向先生所说的情形，由于出版家要减低成本，所以字体越来越小，行格越来越密，不但有失美观，而且损伤青年和儿童的目力。苏联出版书籍，字体行格有一定的规格。出版总署正在研究，准备按书籍的性质、对象，分别规定所用的字体和每页的行格字数。至于在版权页上标明校对者姓名这件事，以前商务印书馆曾有此办法，是值得提倡的。
    书籍用纸的问题在一二年内还不容易解决。我们现在还是要用单面光的极粗糙的新闻纸来印书。这是由于我们的造纸工业还没有充分发展，纸质差而成本高。假如我们大量输入外国纸，本国造纸工业就永远不能发展了。所以目前在用纸方面只得暂时忍耐。至于向先生提议专门著作和比较可以流传久远的书，除普及本外，应另印少数精装本，以供藏书家和图书馆的需要，这一建议很好，希望出版界采纳。
    向先生希望封面应当用较厚的纸，装订应当结实，为的是可以延长书的寿命。这很对。我国的装订技术太落后了，一般图书都是用铁丝订成，这不但容易脱落，而且不便于翻阅。向先生主张不用铁丝而用别种金属丝订，这也还不是解决的办法。要使装订坚固，不易脱页，只有用中键穿线装订法。我国现在在这一方面的机器设备不够，技术工人太少。希望一般印刷厂多购置穿线订书机，多训练一些穿线订书的技术工人。
    目前书的广告确实要改进。不但报纸刊物上可以登书的广告，在书店里和许多公共场所也应当有书的广告。单是一个书目是不够的，一定要加上简短的内容说明。别的国家的图书广告常引用书评中的文字，这个方法，我们也可以采用。
    编印出版新书总目录这件事，出版总署已在做了，一九五○年总目录希望在春季内编成出版。
    书评中应当注明全书的页数、版次和价目，我们很赞成，希望全国书评作者和发表书评的报刊注意。我们要求全国报刊都设书评栏，使书评工作成为联系作者、出版者和读者的主要桥梁。关于这一点，出版总署和新闻总署预备最近发出一个专门指示，在这里附带提一下，希望全国报刊尽可能迅速实行。
    向先生还提议每一本书印出后，附入一张横排的书名纸片，印上书名，作者姓名，页数，版次等等，以供图书馆用作书目卡片。这个建议很好。困难是目前图书馆分类方法还没有统一，如由各出版家自己去印书名纸片，大小式样及项目排列都不会一致，因此对于图书馆用处不大，而对于一般读者却未必需要。在苏联，全国图书馆书目卡片是由中央图书馆统一编制印出，发售给各图书馆的，对于图书馆工作帮助很大。这个工作，国立北京图书馆已经在着手做了。
