　　How Should We Solve Comrade Li Tairan's Problem of Not Focusing on His Work?
    ——Reader Discussion
    Editor's Note: Reader Wang Renfeng's letter actually raises the following questions: First, can a Communist Party member not be humble and learn because he is smart? Or become arrogant because he is smart and knows more about some issues? Second, should a Communist Party member be satisfied with some minor achievements in his work (which are, of course, insignificant compared to the entire revolutionary cause), and act as a hero, boasting and exaggerating to the Party and the people, looking down on everyone, and resisting superiors? Third, is Li Tairan's inferiority complex a sign of humility? Or is it still a manifestation of arrogance? These questions are precisely what some Party cadres need to solve at present. Therefore, we are publishing the original letter here, hoping everyone will discuss it.
                                                Editor:
    I work in a cultural institution. Comrade Li Tairan, who works with me, is a Communist Party member with ten years of Party membership. He used to work in radio, and he was transferred here to work as a secretary the winter before last year. His work attitude was good when he first came; after encountering some difficulties in his work, he became discouraged and even asked for a job transfer. Regarding this issue, some comrades believe that since he has a set of skills, he should not change his profession; others believe that he should obey the needs of the work; if he doesn’t know how, he can learn. Which of these two opinions is correct? Please answer. To facilitate your reply, I am writing his detailed situation below:
    Comrade Li Tairan was born into a middle-peasant family and attended high school. After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, he joined the revolutionary work with patriotic enthusiasm and soon joined the Communist Party. At the beginning of 1940, the leadership assigned him to study radio. He thought: A revolutionary worker must learn some skills to contribute to the revolution. Thus, he worked hard when learning radio. Half a year later, he learned the technology of receiving reports. In August of that year, when the Eighth Route Army launched the Hundred Regiments Offensive, he, the section chief, and the station director, persisted in radio work while following the troops on frequent marches. The work that should have been done by six people copying and sending, and six people translating, was done by four people through their active efforts. Therefore, they were all commended. Soon, because he progressed quickly, he was promoted to station director and section chief.
    During the Liberation War, Comrade Li Tairan was ordered to take two radio stations to work with the troops. No matter what the circumstances, he never left the machines; as soon as he settled down, he would set up the lines to work. In such a tense combat environment, his work tasks could be completed well. In this work, he was again commended. The comrades also praised him for being responsible and having skills. He himself said proudly that he had "worked hard for the revolution even if I have made no great achievements!"
    Comrade Li Tairan's radio technology is also not bad. He is proficient in receiving and sending both English and Chinese reports; however, Comrade Li Tairan has a big shortcoming: he is arrogant, looks down on everyone, despises and distrusts others, and has a very serious phenomenon of monopolizing and replacing others in his work; towards himself, he likes to boast about his work achievements or say that he is a person who "passed five passes and beheaded six generals."
    The winter before last year, due to work needs, and because his technology was also lagging behind the needs of urban work, for example: in large cities, radio receiving and sending are automatic, and there is no manual receiving and sending, Comrade Li Tairan was transferred here to work as a secretary. When he first came, his mood was still high. He said to familiar comrades, "I have led three or five radio stations, this kind of work is not easy to do?!" I'll be proficient in ten days and a half months. He started by writing letters. On the first day, because he was not familiar with the policies and systems, he wrote very few letters, but after fumbling for a few days, the speed of writing letters increased to about ten. Then he began to organize materials; two pieces of material were sent to the newspaper and published in the newspaper. Thus, he said to his comrades again: "You see, secretarial work is very easy to do!" From then on, he gradually slackened his work, especially unwilling to use his brain to think about problems.
    Last year, the Central People's Government announced the Land Reform Law and the Government Administration Council announced the Decision on Dividing Rural Class Components. The institution organized study. Comrade Li Tairan read the documents twice and went to read novels. At the study discussion meeting, he talked a lot, the central meaning of which was: this land reform law is different from the previous one in that it preserves the rich peasant economy, and the rest remains the same. He felt that although he had not specifically led land reform, he had participated in several struggles and still had some experience. After that, when studying, he was either late or made excuses not to study, and even secretly went to the movies.
    Once, a ×× training class wrote to ask about the method of studying the Land Reform Law. Comrade Li Tairan rashly replied: The characteristic of this land reform law is to preserve the rich peasant economy, and you should focus on studying this point. This training class studied according to his opinion, and did not study this policy comprehensively and systematically from the general policy and general line, so they always could not study it thoroughly. Later, the training class checked out this problem and reported it to our responsible comrade. Therefore, he was criticized. At first, he insisted on his original opinion. Later, after the help of the group, he began to realize that he had a one-sided understanding of the policy. But he still did not admit that he had the phenomenon of disorganization and lack of discipline. He said: "Writing a letter also requires asking for instructions, is the leadership too busy?" After the meeting, he said to people: "I have been making revolution for more than ten years, what confidential work have I not done?! Now writing a letter also requires asking for instructions, it's too distrustful of cadres," "No, transfer my work," "Distrust me, Li Tairan, that I can't find a job if I leave here"….
    From then on, Comrade Li Tairan had a great burden on his mind. As he himself said, his mind was always turning: "In the past, I was a good cadre, I have overcome all difficult environments, and I have completed all difficult tasks. Who among the leaders and comrades did not praise and commend me! Why am I being criticized for doing this one job, am I really not good enough?" "Not necessarily! If I can't do this job well, does that mean I can't do other jobs well!" "If I can't do other jobs well, does that mean I can't do radio work well"! So he adopted a passive attitude towards work. The things he sorted out are always the same old "advantages, disadvantages, experiences, lessons, model examples". He could not raise any problems. In addition to having individual talks with him, the leadership also circulated the materials he sorted out for everyone to read and asked everyone to discuss and revise them to help him improve. This method of studying business had been used in the past. But when Comrade Li Tairan saw that it was being used on him, he became very angry. He said: "There is no standard for sorting out materials and writing articles. You say this is well written, but there are even better written ones. This is not like '○○二二' is a '中' character, '五四七八' is a '华' character... as long as you send 'di di da da' correctly, it is absolutely correct." On the other hand, although he also saw that some young people's sorted out things were more fluent than his and could explain some problems. But he said that he did not believe that these people's working ability was really stronger than him, maybe because they had studied for a few more years and had some culture. He said: "Maybe I'm really not good at this line!" He had a request to transfer his work: "Even if I can't 'return to my original line', I can still do other work," "I have learned technology and done leadership work. I may be a good example in factories and villages"; but he did not dare to directly raise it to the leadership. Some people said: "Comrade Li Tairan is humble!" Some people criticized him: "He is not active in his work and is still arrogant!" What about him? "If you think I'm not good, then transfer my work!"

### 李泰然同志不安心工作问题应该怎样解决？——读者问题讨论

　　李泰然同志不安心工作问题应该怎样解决？
    ——读者问题讨论
    编者按：读者王仁峰来信中，实际上提出了这样几个问题：第一，一个共产党员是不是可以因为自己的聪明而可以不虚心学习；或因自己聪明多了解了一些问题而自高自大？第二，一个共产党员是不是应该满足于自己工作上的某些微小的成就（当然这和整个革命事业比较起来是微小得不足道的），而以功臣自居，向党和人民吹牛夸大，目空一切，轻视同志，对抗上级呢？第三，像李泰然这种自卑情绪，是虚心的表现呢？或仍是自高自大的表现？这些问题，正是目前一部分党员干部需要解决的问题。因此把原信发表在这里，希望大家来讨论。
                                                编辑同志：
    我在一个文化机关工作。和我一起工作的李泰然同志是已有十年党龄的共产党员。他过去是作无线电工作的，前年冬天调到这里作秘书工作。他初来时工作情绪还好；在工作中遇到一些困难后，就泄气了。甚至要求调动工作。对这个问题有的同志认为既然他有一套技术，就不应该转业；有的同志认为他应服从工作需要；不会，可以学习。这两种意见究竟那种对呢？请你们答复一下。为了便于你们答复，现将他的详细情形写在后面：
    李泰然同志出身于中农家庭，曾在高小念过书。抗日战争爆发后，他在爱国热情激励下，参加了革命工作，不久参加了共产党。一九四○年初，上级分配他去学习无线电。他想：一个革命工作人员总得学会一点本领，对革命才能有所贡献。这样，他学习无线电时很下苦功。半年后，他学会了收报技术。当年八月八路军进行百团大战时，他和科长、台长，在跟随部队频繁的行军中，坚持了电台工作。本来应该六人抄发、六人译的工作，在他们积极努力下，四个人就作了。因此，他们都受到了表扬。不久，因为他进步很快，即升为台长、科长。
    在解放战争中，李泰然同志奉命带两部电台随部队工作。无论在任何情况下，他总不离机器；只要一住下，他便架起线来工作。在这样紧张的战斗环境中，他的工作任务都能很好的完成。在这次工作中，他又受到了表扬。同志们也都称赞他负责任，有技术。他自己也得意地说，对革命“咱没功劳也有苦劳了！”
    李泰然同志的无线电技术也还不坏，无论收发中英文报都很熟练；但是李泰然同志有个很大的缺点，自高自大，目空一切，对别人则轻视，不相信，工作上包办代替的现象非常严重；对自己，则好夸耀自己的工作成绩或说自己是“过五关斩六将”的人。
    前年冬天，因为工作需要，同时他的技术也已落后于城市工作的需要，例如：大城市无线电收发报都是自动的，已没有用手收发，因此李泰然同志被调到这里作秘书工作。初来时，他情绪还高，他和熟悉的同志说，三个五个的电台都领导了，这种工作还不容易作？！十天半月就熟练了。他开始是写信，第一天，因为他对政策与制度都不熟悉，写信很少，但在摸了几天之后，写信的速度就增加到十封左右。接着他又开始整理材料；有两份材料寄给报社，还在报纸上发表了。这样，他又对同志说：“你看，秘书工作就是很容易作吧！”从此，他对工作逐渐松懈下来，特别是不愿意开动脑筋，考虑问题。
    去年中央人民政府公布了土地改革法与政务院公布关于划分农村阶级成份的决定，机关里就组织学习。李泰然同志把文件看了两遍，就看小说去了。在学习讨论会上，他夸夸其谈地说了一大套，中心意思是：这次土地改革法，就是保存富农经济部分与前不同，其余照旧。他觉得自己虽没有专门领导过土地改革，但也参加过几次斗争，总还有些经验。以后学习时，他不是迟到便是借故不学习，甚至偷偷去看电影。
    有一次××训练班来信请示学习土地改革法的方法，李泰然同志就冒然地给人家答复：这次土地改革法的特征是保存富农经济，你们就应该抓紧这点学习。这个训练班就按照他的意见学习，没有从总政策总路线出发，全面地系统地来学习这一政策，因此总是学习不下去。后来训练班把这问题检查出来了，就报告给我们的负责同志。因此他受到了批评。开始他坚持原来的意见，后来经过小组帮助，他才开始认识到自己对政策作了片面的了解。但是他仍不承认自己有无组织无纪律的现象。他说：“写封信也得请示，上级不太忙？”会后他给人说：“革命革了十几年，什么机密的工作没作过？！现在写封信也得请示，太不相信干部了”，“不行，调动我的工作”，“不相信我李泰然离开这里就找不到工作”……。
    从此，李泰然同志思想上有了很大的负担，正像他自己所说的，脑子里总是在转：“过去咱是好干部，什么困难环境都过来了，什么艰难任务都完成了，上级和同志谁不表扬，称赞！为什么干这一个工作倒受了批评，自己真不行了吗？”“不见得！这个工作作不好，难道别的工作也作不好！”“别的工作作不好，难道无电线工作还作不好”！于是他对工作采取了消极应付的态度，整理出的东西总是“优（点）缺（点）经（验）教（训）模（范例子）”老一套，提不出什么问题，领导上除了和他进行个别谈话外，又把他整理的材料让大家传阅，并要大家讨论修改，以帮助他进步。本来这个研究业务的办法过去也用过。可是李泰然同志见到用在他身上了，他就很生气，他说：“整理材料，写文章没有什么标准。你说这写的好，可是还有写得更好的。这不像“○○二二”是个“中”字，“五四七八”是个“华”字……只要你滴滴哒哒发对了，就是绝对的对了。”另一方面，他虽然也看到有些年青人整理的东西，比自己的通顺，还能说明一些问题。但他说，他是不相信这些人的工作能力真比他强，可能因为他们多念了几年书，有一些文化之故。他说：“也许我干这行真不行！”他就有了调动工作的要求：“即使不能‘回本行’，也还可以做其他工作”，“自己学过技术，做过领导工作，到工厂到农村也许是个好样儿的”；但他又不敢直接向上级提出来。有人说：“李泰然同志虚心了！”有人批评他：“工作不积极，还是自高自大！”，他呢？“你们看着不行的话，就调动我的工作吧！”
