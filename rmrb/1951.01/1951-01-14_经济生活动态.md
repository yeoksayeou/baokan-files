　　Economic Life Dynamics
　　Wuxiang Rural Areas Launch Winter Production Competition
　　Sixty percent of the villages in Wuxiang County, Shanxi Province, that is, 102 villages, have responded to the call of Li Shunda, a first-class labor model in the province, and launched a winter production competition. More than 70 mutual aid groups have also formulated three-year production plans. (January 9th, Shanxi Daily)
　　Kazakh People Begin Trading in Dunhuang
　　The Kazakh people, who were driven out of Xinjiang by the warlord Sheng Shicai eight years ago, could only live a nomadic life in the Nanshan area, more than a thousand miles south of Dunhuang County, Gansu Province, due to the discrimination and oppression of the Kuomintang reactionaries. After liberation, the Kazakh people saw the light of day again. In mid-November of last year, they sent representatives to the Dunhuang People's Government to discuss trade matters. By mid-December, more than 80 people from four tribes, including Jianabei, Mushabaye, Shahaidunle, and Husaiving, had driven cattle and sheep and brought furs to Dunhuang to start free trade and returned with profits.

　　Zalaite Banner Farmers' Sideline Production Reaches 8 Billion Yuan
　　Due to the leadership's acceptance of the past experience of only calling for but not leading sideline production in winter, and the beginning of clear division of labor, mastering sales channels, and achieving layer-by-layer responsibility, the income of farmers' sideline production in Zalaite Banner, Inner Mongolia, reached 8 billion yuan last winter. (January 10th, Inner Mongolia Daily)
　　Zunhua's Autumn Grain Collection Work is More Advanced than the Summer Collection
　　Zunhua County's autumn grain collection work is more advanced than the summer collection, and is now nearing completion. During the summer collection, 453 villages in the county did not follow the policies, while only 131 villages followed the policies. This shortcoming has been basically overcome in the autumn grain collection work. (Zhang Jinxiu)
　　Haizhou Flour Mill Rewards Overproduction
　　All employees of the state-owned Haizhou Flour Mill in Xin Hai Lian City, Shandong Province, have invested in the patriotic production competition. In November and December of last year, the production volume of flour exceeded the stipulated output in the collective contract by 1,277 bags, and saved a lot of lubricating oil, seam thread, and other materials. All employees of the mill received 40% of the overproduction as a bonus. (Shen Jingchun, Wang Ren, Wang Qingtian)
　　No Accidents at Datong Dongshazui Small Coal Mine in Two Months
　　In the safety competition in the fourth quarter of last year, the state-owned Datong Coal Mine's Dongshazui Small Coal Mine gradually improved all aspects of production and implemented a dedicated responsibility system and a reward and punishment system, so that no casualties occurred in October and November of last year.

　　Linhuai Labor Team No. 8 Completes Task Ahead of Schedule
　　The eighth team of the Linhuai labor force, in the blockage project in the middle reaches of the Huai River, created a new record of an average of six cubic meters of earth moved per person per day with high labor enthusiasm. The entire team of 120 people completed more than 7,000 cubic meters of earth in ten days, shortening the time required to complete the task by half, which was originally estimated by the engineer to be 20 days based on the actual situation.
