　　On the Language of Frontline Agitators
　　Kalinin
　　Editor's note: This article is a record of Kalinin's speech at the Frontline Agitators Symposium on April 28, 1943, and was included in Kalinin's book "On Communist Education." Some of the important principles of agitation work put forward here can also be applied to general mass propaganda work. It is reprinted here for comrades engaged in mass propaganda work to study and refer to.
　　
　　Every agitator tries his best to have a sincere conversation. What is a sincere attitude? I know that agitators often go to the soldiers with a predetermined purpose, that is, to have a sincere conversation with them. The agitator has such a predetermined purpose, and this alone makes the conversation insincere. But if the agitator goes to the soldiers to drink tea, chat with them first, and then talk about a certain issue that everyone is concerned about, then the conversation is a truly casual conversation.
　　
　　Let me give another example. If a person makes a mistake, so you scold him and teach him a lesson, and then say: "Well, I won't tell others about this, but you have to be careful. If you make a mistake again, I can't cover it up anymore." -- This can also be a sincere attitude. If the agitator has a certain purpose to talk sincerely, it is almost impossible to be effective every time.
　　
　　What I mean by casual conversation is to make everyone feel free to ask you any questions that interest them, without feeling that the agitator came to them with a certain purpose. Of course, the agitator has many tasks that are specially planned, and these tasks must also be completed. But in this casual conversation we are talking about, the issues to be discussed will naturally be extended.
　　
　　Try to arouse everyone to exchange opinions, arouse them to argue, so that you can judge them as a judge, who is right and who is wrong.
　　
　　The so-called casual conversation does not mean that you should not guide the conversation. Guidance is necessary, but when doing this work, you must make everyone not feel that you are talking to them with a certain task.
　　
　　But when you go to the soldiers and say, "Today I am here to talk about a certain issue," this is also completely reasonable. Because all agitation work must not be limited to a casual conversation. However, no matter what issue you are talking about, you should emphasize one point: that is, we must smash the German bandits. To smash the German bandits, we must do everything possible and even impossible.
　　
　　The way of talking varies with the environment. If there are many listeners, then the conversation can be conducted in the form of a speech or a conference. If you enter a trench bunker, you can talk in a question-and-answer format. If you want the soldiers to have a more detailed understanding of a certain issue, then you are limited to talking about this one issue, and tell the audience in advance that today you will only talk about this topic, and other issues will be discussed later.
　　
　　I want to draw your attention to this point: the agitator should never put on airs and show that he knows more than the surrounding listeners and is more intelligent. I have been a propagandist and agitator for many years and have many years of experience, so I know that as long as everyone slightly notices that the agitator is putting on airs and thinks that he is more intelligent than them, then this agitator is unlucky and everyone will not believe him. When you talk to Red Army soldiers, you must recognize that they are people who understand various issues. If someone among them says that he does not understand a certain issue, then you must refute him and say: "Don't pretend, is your head made of wood? I think you understand everything no worse than I do. You are just playing tricks." Never underestimate people. Even if someone says that a certain soldier "is a fool and doesn't understand anything," you should say: "I know such a fool. Look, he will make a good soldier. You have already been in the front for a long time and have learned. Look, he will become such a soldier too." If you treat people like this, they will definitely respect you.
　　
　　There are many things that everyone can forgive you for, but if you are arrogant, then people will never forgive you, and the main thing is that they will never regard arrogance as intelligence. For example, you find out that a certain soldier has been in the front for a long time, but he has not killed a single German bandit. There are various different attitudes that can be taken towards this fact. Some agitators will ridicule this soldier, while others will remind him that others have already killed several German bandits. If it were me, I would say something like this: "It's nothing. Maybe not every Red Army soldier can kill a German bandit; if everyone could do this, then we would have killed all the German bandits long ago. But if all the soldiers could kill German bandits, it would be much better after all. War is still war. The German bandits want to destroy us, and we also want to destroy the German bandits. Therefore, every soldier must try to fight the enemy bravely anyway."
　　
　　Agitators should be honest. Don't tell the soldiers tall tales, but tell the truth. Don't be afraid to point out the difficult situation, because you are talking to very sensible adults.
　　
　　The most difficult thing in agitation work is to learn to speak well. At first glance, it seems that there is nothing great about this. Everyone has started speaking since they were two years old! In fact, this is a very important and difficult thing. Where is the difficulty here?
　　
　　The agitator should express his meaning clearly, so that this meaning can create the kind of impression that the agitator hopes for. At the same time, you should explain your meaning concisely, because you don't have much time. The meaning should be clear to the audience, so that everyone can understand it. These are all extremely difficult things.
　　
　　Learn language from typical writers. Take Turgenev for example. Where can you find character images that are described so vividly in his works? Let each of you try to describe your own wife. If you want to write like this, can you find the right words? Although you know your lover very well, not everyone can do this. Then they will write ordinary words. But you should know that the requirements for agitators are more: to make him describe vividly and thoroughly.
　　
　　Language is extremely important for agitators. What you talk about with the soldiers is what they already know. So only if you say these things well and thoroughly can you arouse their interest. Here I avoid using the word "beautiful", because we people are often fascinated by words, thinking that this is very good, but in fact, using some stereotyped words to intoxicate people's minds is extremely embarrassing. I know there are agitators who can speak for three hours in a row, but after they finish speaking, nothing is left in the audience's minds except for individual noises, because there is no meaning in what they say. You should know that in front of you are soldiers, ordinary people who have fought thousands of kilometers, and they have seen many painful things. Therefore, clichés, especially icing on the cake, are as unbearable to them as eating coptis chinensis. What they need is for the agitator to briefly and clearly express a certain meaning. And wonderful meanings can always be repeated. For example, if someone says to you, "Why are you always talking about digging trenches?", that's not a big deal. Then you answer: "I will always talk to you about this issue until you learn to dig trenches; I feel sorry for your heads and I am afraid that you will sacrifice in vain."
　　
　　The agitator should be a knowledgeable person. He should read more and work harder. In my opinion, the agitator should use all his free time to read books and newspapers. Read more works by typical Chinese writers. Read more works by Lenin and Stalin. Learn to carry out agitation work in the style of Stalin. Comrade Stalin is an excellent agitator. How well he knows how to talk to the people!
　　
　　Even an agitator who is knowledgeable, has read many things, and understands military affairs should always prepare in advance before giving a speech. You should know that our knowledge is limited after all, so we must prepare thoroughly and make full use of our knowledge every time. Therefore, I very much agree with often conducting conversations on certain issues, because this kind of conversation can provide more knowledge and strengthen everyone's discipline. But when you feel that a certain issue has been discussed to the point of boredom and you want to talk casually, then you go to the soldiers to drink tea and chat with them.
　　
　　However, even casual conversations should be prepared in advance, because in casual conversations everyone will definitely ask you a lot of questions. Don't avoid answering, and don't try to get around the questions asked. Even if you can't answer a certain question, don't be afraid. At this time, you should directly say: "I don't know. I have to find the answer in the book; if I find it, I will tell everyone later."
　　
　　People sometimes ask: "Among our soldiers, especially the older soldiers, there are some religious people who wear crosses and often pray, but young people make fun of them." It should be remembered that we do not investigate any religious people. We regard religion as a drug and use education to fight against religion. Since there are still quite a few religious people among the residents, and some of them still have deep faith in religion, then you cannot defeat religion with ridicule. Of course, if a young man is just joking, then this is not very terrible; but never let the joke turn into ridicule. Ridicule is not allowed.
　　
　　What should the agitator pay special attention to at present?
　　
　　We should do our best to promote strengthening organization. How is this done? Let's take a simple example: when it's time to eat, but the food truck hasn't arrived yet, you have to find it somewhere. If you encounter such a situation, this is a ready-made topic for you to talk about organization. Let everyone discuss how to make the food truck always arrive at a certain place on time, and how to achieve this, etc. In this kind of conversation, you might as well reprimand our Russian sloppiness, -- this bad habit still exists today, and we must fight against it. If I were an agitator, I would spend 90 percent of my time elaborating on this topic.
　　
　　Our main shortcoming is complacency. We are still often indifferent and think: "Oh, forget it, it's okay to be sloppy." We all know that since a unit is defending a position, it should do its best to consolidate and maintain the position. If it is attacking, it should try to make the attack effective and minimize its losses and sacrifices. But we people often act hastily, and as a result, the results are very bad. We must resolutely break the complacency.
　　
　　The reason why we encountered many difficulties in the early days of the war was because we did not organize the battles well. You should know that the overall problem is that the battles must be organized well. All military personnel should be good organizers. In the past, many commanders believed that battles should be organized in the command post. However, this is only the final stage of organization work. When the commander goes to the command post during the battle, he is only reaping the consequences of his preparations.
　　
　　I think it is very important to cultivate a cautious mentality among the soldiers. It is very inappropriate for people to sit in the open and eat on the front line. If a shell lands there, it will cause chaos, kill people, and new soldiers will have to be transferred to replace them. You agitators must resolutely fight against those who despise danger.
　　
　　At the same time, you must also encourage everyone to develop military intelligence and talent. The reason why I specifically mention the word intelligence is because you are working among Red Army soldiers, and their scope of activities is limited. You must influence the soldiers and say: they should carefully consider their actions and strive to do everything as well as possible, and try to outsmart the enemy as much as possible. The reason why superb marksmanship is so valuable is also because it can teach everyone to think about their actions and develop an instinct like a hunter. The superb marksman wants to kill the enemy, and the enemy also wants to kill him. Therefore, the superb marksman should fully learn to use intelligence: he must be good at hiding himself, have extremely sharp eyes, and have very strong hands. This quality should be possessed not only by superb marksmen, but also by all our soldiers.
　　
　　Try to teach the soldiers to dig trenches. We people sometimes try to avoid this work, especially when attacking. The soldiers say: "Why dig trenches? We won't need them in a while?" But you should influence them and say: trench work is needed anytime and anywhere, even if the trenches will not be needed, this work is also a very important training in the current struggle we are conducting.
　　
　　I think you should also take great care of the wounded. The wounded need comforting words, and they need people to express sympathy. Therefore, in this situation, you should show your sincerity and friendliness. The wounded will never forget the friendly attitude, and they will tell it hundreds of times. As a result, this whisper will spread far and wide.
　　
　　You should educate the Red Army soldiers to respect the dead. What is the attitude of the people towards the dead? When someone dies, everyone whispers around him. You should know that we should especially respect the fallen, and it is up to you agitators to promote this rule. I have sent letters to the chairmen of the executive committees in various places, asking them to repair all the martyrs' tombs properly and entrust this work to the Young Pioneers. In the troops, you should ensure that burials are carried out according to certain rituals and that the tombs are raised. Of course, this cannot always be done when the army is advancing, but there are also agitators who are advancing with the second echelon. You must publicize and pay attention to making the ceremony for burying Red Army soldiers as solemn as possible. This can affect education and teach people to love the defenders of the motherland.
　　
　　The agitator should always be the leader of the masses and guide the masses. The role of the agitator is particularly important during combat. Sometimes even a good unit will lose confidence in its strength after suffering heavy losses. At this moment, the agitator can boost morale and create a change in the course of the battle.
　　
　　The agitator should always judge the situation and consider who to work among. You are working among soldiers, that is, among very disciplined people, but these people are bearing extremely difficult burdens. Pay attention to this, and also pay attention to the fact that everyone is different in terms of ethnicity, age, and personality. All of this should be estimated by the agitator.

　　论前线鼓动员的语言
    加里宁
    编者按：本文是一九四三年四月二十八日加里宁在前线鼓动员座谈会上的发言记录，曾收入加里宁所著“论共产主义教育”一书。这里面所提出有关鼓动工作的若干重要原则，同样可以适用于一般的群众宣传工作，特为转载，以供从事群众宣传工作的同志们研究和参考。
    每个鼓动员都极力想进行倾诚的谈话。什么叫做倾诚态度呢？我知道鼓动员走到战士们那里去，往往预先抱定目的，就是要去同他们倾诚地谈谈。鼓动员既预先抱定这种目的，单就这点说来，已经使谈话成为不倾诚的了。但如果鼓动员是到战士们那里去喝喝茶，同他们先闲谈起来，然后再讲到他们大家所关注的某个问题，那时谈话才是真正随随便便的谈话。
    再举另一个例子来说吧。一个人若是犯了过错，因此你把他责斥一顿，教训他一番之后，说道：“呶，得了，这件事我并不告诉别人，但你要当心，你若再犯过错的话，我却再不能掩盖了。”——这也会是一种倾诚态度。要是鼓动员抱着一定目的去倾诚地谈话时，这几乎是每次都不能奏效的。
    我所说的随随便便的谈话，就是要使大家不受任何拘束，能提出对他们发生兴趣的一切问题来问你，不致于感觉到鼓动员来到他们那里是抱有一定的目的。当然，鼓动员负有专门规划的许多任务，这种任务也是要去完成的。但在我们所说的这种随随便便的谈话中，要谈的问题也就会自然而然地被引伸出来的。
    要设法唤起大家来交换意见，引起他们来争论，使你能够好似以评判员资格去判定他们，谁是谁非。
    所谓随随便便谈话，这并不是说不要去指导谈话。指导是必要的，但进行这番工作时，必须使大家不致觉得你是负有一定任务来同他们谈话的。
    但当你们走到战士们跟前说：“今天我是来谈谈某个问题的。”这同样是完全合理的。因为决不能把全部鼓动工作都局限于一种随随便便的谈话上。然而，不管是去谈论什么问题，你们都应当强调指出一点：即我们必须粉碎德寇，要粉碎德寇，就得做到一切可能以至不可能的事情。
    谈话方式本来是以环境为转移的。若是听众很多，那时谈话可用演讲或大会方式来进行。如果你们走进战壕掩蔽部内，那就可以用问答方式来进行谈话。若是想使战士们对某个问题有比较周详的了解，那你们就只限于讲这一个问题，并预告听众，说今天同他们只讲这个题目，至于旁的问题以后再谈。
    我想使你们注意到这样一点：鼓动员决不应当摆出一种架子，表示自己比周围的听众多知道一些，要高明一些。我当过多年的宣传员和鼓动员，拥有多年的经验，所以我知道，只要大家稍微发觉鼓动员在摆架子，认为自己比他们都高明一些，那时，这鼓动员就倒霉了，大家就不会信仰他。你们在同红军战士谈话时，要认定他们是懂得各种问题的人。假使他们中间有人说他对某一问题不懂时，那你们总要反驳他说：“你别装假，难道你的脑袋是木头不成？我看，对一切问题，你了解的并不比我差，你不过是在耍手腕罢了。”决不要轻视人们。尽管别人说到某个战士“ 是个笨虫，什么事也不懂”，但你们却要说：“我知道这样的笨人，看吧，他会造成一个很好的战士的。你们早已就在前方，学习过了，看，他也会成为这样的战士。”你们如果这样去对待人们，那他们定会尊敬你的。
    有很多事情大家可以原谅你们，但你们若自高自大，那人家就永远也不会原谅，主要的是决不会把自傲当作聪明看待。譬如说，你们打听到某个战士来到前方很久，但他连一个德寇也还没有击毙。对这一事实，可以采取各种不同的态度。有些鼓动员会去挖苦这位战士，另一些鼓动员却会提醒他说，你看别人都已经击毙了好几个德寇。要是我的话，我就会大约这样说：“没有什么，也许，并不是每个红军战士都能击毙德寇；假如个个人都能这样做的话，那我们早已就把所有的德寇都杀光了。但是如果全体战士都能击毙德寇，那终究要好得多。战争总还是战争。德寇要消灭我们，我们也要消灭德寇。所以每个战士无论如何都要设法去奋身杀敌才对。”
    鼓动员要老老实实。不要向战士们说得天花乱坠，而应道出真情实况，不要害怕指明困难情形，因为你们是在同很能懂事的成年人谈话。
    鼓动工作中最困难的一件事情，就是学会好好说话。猝然看来，似乎这又有什么了不起呢，每个人从两岁起就已开始说话哩！其实，这是件又重大又困难的事情。这里的困难在什么地方呢？
    鼓动员应当鲜明地表达自己的意思，要使这意思能造成正如鼓动员所希望的那种印象。同时你们应当简截地说明自己的意思，因为你们的时间不多。意思要对听众都很明豁，要使每个人都能听懂。这都是极困难的事。
    要向典型作家学习语言。拿屠格涅夫来说吧。你们从何处能找到像在他的作品内描写得唯妙唯肖的人物形象呢？就让你们每个人那怕是去描写描写自己的老婆吧。你们要这样写作，是否能找到恰当的话语呢？虽然对自己的爱人知道得极清楚，但这也不是每个人都能做到的。那他们就会写出平常普通的话来。但须知对鼓动员的要求更多一些：要使他描写得鲜明透彻。
    对于鼓动员说来，语言极关重要。你们同战士们谈说的，都是他们所知道的事情。所以你们只有把这些事情说得又好又透彻时，才能使他们发生兴趣。这里我回避用“漂亮”一语，因为我们人常常迷恋词句，自己以为这样很好，但其实用些刻板字句来沉醉人们的脑筋，这是极难堪的。我知道有种鼓动员，他们能一连讲说三个钟头，但当他们讲罢之后，听众脑子内除了个别的喧嚣声之外，没有留下任何东西，因为他们所讲的话里毫无意思。须知在你们面前的是些战士，是些作战走了几千公里路的普通人，他们见过许多沉痛的事，所以千篇一律尤其是锦上添花的话语，对于他们简直像吃黄连那样的难受。他们所需要的，是鼓动员能简短明了地说出一定的意思来。并且精彩的意思总不妨重复。例如，假使有人向你们说“你怎么老在说挖战壕？”，这也不大要紧。那你们就回答说：“在你们还没学会挖战壕之前，我总归要对你们讲说这个问题；我是怜惜你们的脑袋，怕你们白白地牺牲。”
    鼓动员应当是一个知识发达的人。他要多多读书和多多用功。在我看来，鼓动员应把所有的空闲时间都用去阅读书报。多读我国典型作家的作品。多读列宁和斯大林的著作。要学习按照斯大林的作风去进行鼓动工作。斯大林同志是位极好的鼓动家。他该是怎样善于同人民说话啊！
    甚至是一个富有知识，读过许多东西并懂得军事的鼓动员，也应当经常在进行谈话前，事先加以准备。须知我们的知识终归有限，所以每次都要切实准备，充分地来利用自己的知识。因而我很赞成常常来进行关于一定问题的谈话，因为这种谈话能提供更多的知识并加强大家的纪律性。但当你感觉到一定的问题已经谈厌了，却想来随便谈谈时，那你就到战士们那里去喝喝茶，借此同他们畅谈一下。
    然而就是随便的谈话，也要事先准备好，因为在便谈中大家定会向你们发出一大堆问题。不要回避答复，不要设法绕过所发的问题。就即令你们对某个问题不能回答，也不要害怕。这时你们就直截了当地说：“我不知道，我得在书本上去找回答；如果我找到时，再来告诉大家。”
    人们有时问道：“在我们战士中间，特别是年长的战士中间，有些信教的人，他们带着十字牌，常作祷告，青年人却拿他们来开玩笑。”应当记住，我们对于任何信教的人，都是不加追究的。我们认为宗教是一种迷药，要用教育来与宗教作斗争。既然居民中信教的人还相当多，其中某些人对宗教还信仰得很深，那末你用讥笑的办法是战胜不了宗教的。当然，如果某个青年只是来开开玩笑，那这还不十分可怕；可是决不要使玩笑变为讥笑，讥笑是不能容许的。
    目前鼓动员应特别注意的是些什么呢？
    要最多去宣传加强组织性。这点怎样进行呢？试举这样一个简单例子吧：到了吃饭的时候，但饭车还没有开来，要到什么地方去找它。你们如果碰见这样的情形，这就是你们进行关于组织性谈话的一个现成题目。让大家来讨论讨论，怎样能使得饭车经常按时开到一定地方，以及如何去做到这点等。在这种谈话会上，不妨好好责斥责斥我们俄罗斯人的松懈习气，——这种恶习至今还有，要同它作斗争。假使我是鼓动员的话，我定要拿百分之九十的时间去发挥这一话题。
    我们的主要缺点，便是泰然自若。我们还常常漠不关心地想着：“哦，算了吧，马虎一点也过得去的。”我们大家都知道：一个部队既然扼守阵地，那它就应当竭尽全力，以便把阵地巩固起来并保持下去，若在进攻的时候，就应当想方设法使进攻奏效，并使自己尽量少受损失和牺牲。而我们人常常仓忙从事，因之，收到的结果很坏。要坚决地打破泰然自若的心理。
    我们在战争初期之所以遇到了许多困难，是因为没有好好地组织战斗，须知全般问题就在于战斗要组织好。全体军事工作人员，都应当是好组织家。以前许多指挥官认为战斗要在指挥所去组织。殊不知这只是组织工作的一个最后阶段。当战斗中指挥官走上指挥所时，他这时不过是已经在坐收自己准备工作的后果了。
    我认为在战士中培植一种谨慎心理，是很重要的事。前线上，人们坐在开阔地上吃饭，是很不妥当的。若是一颗炮弹落到那里，就要造出乱子，就会打死人，那就要调新战士去代替他们。你们这些鼓动员，必须坚决同轻视危险的人作斗争。
    同时，你们也要鼓动大家来发扬军事机智和材干。我之所以特别提到机智一语，因为你们是在红军战士中进行工作，他们的活动范围是有限制的。要感化战士们说：他们应当很周到地考量自己的动作，力求把一切事都做得尽量好，并且要尽可能地去巧过敌人。超等射击术之所以非常宝贵，也因为它能教会大家思考自己的动作，使他们养成一种如像猎手的本能。超等射手想击毙敌人，而敌人也想来击毙他。所以超等射手应当充分学会使用机智：他要善于掩蔽自己，要有极锐利的眼光，要有很坚强的手力。要使这种特质不仅为超等射手，而且为我们全体战士所具备。
    要尽量教战士掘战壕。我们人却有时设法避免这种工作，特别是在进攻的时候。战士们说：“干么要掘战壕，一会儿就用不着它了？”可是你们应该感化他们说：战壕作业随时随地都需要，就即令战壕是会用不着的，但这一作业在我们目前进行的斗争中，也是一种很重要的训练。
    我认为你们还应该大大照顾伤员。伤员们需要有亲热话来安慰，需要人们表示同感，所以在这种场合，你们应当表现自己的衷忱。友好态度，伤员们是永远不会忘记的，他们将千百遍地来叙述这点。结果这种低声细语就会传扬到很远的地方去。
    你们应当教育红军战士去尊敬阵亡的人。试问民间对死者的态度怎样呢？当某人去世时，大家在他身旁都是轻声细语。须知对阵亡者应当特别尊敬，至于把这种规例推行起来，就要靠你们鼓动员。我已经给各地执委会主席去了信，叫他们把一切烈士坟墓都应培修妥当，并将这种工作委托儿童团员们去做。你们在部队中应当做到在殡葬时要按照一定的仪式，坟土都要培高。当然在军队前进时，这不是经常都能做到的，可是也有鼓动员是随着第二梯队行进的。你们要宣传并注视着使安葬红军士兵的仪式尽量隆重。这能影响到教育方面，教人们去爱戴祖国的捍卫者。
    鼓动员始终都应成为群众的指导者，引导群众。在进行战斗时鼓动员的作用特别重大。有时甚至是一个精良部队，在遭受重创之后，也会对自己的力量失去信心。在这种关头，鼓动员能够去鼓起士气，能够造成战斗进程中的转变。
    鼓动员随时都应当判断情况，考量到究竟要在什么人中间进行工作。你们是在战士们中间，就是在很有纪律的人们中间工作，但这些人都肩负着极艰苦的重荷。要注意到这点，也要注意到大家在民族成份、年龄和性格方面都不相同的事实。所有这一切，都是鼓动员应当估计到的。
