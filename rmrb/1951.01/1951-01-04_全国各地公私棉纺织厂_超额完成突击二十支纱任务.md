Xinhua News Agency, December 30th: Public and private cotton textile factories across the country have successively exceeded the task assigned by the government to increase the production of twenty-count yarn. In response, Chen Yun, Director of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government, wrote a letter to the National Textile Workers' Union on December 25th, congratulating them and awarding a bonus of 500 million yuan as a fund for the National Textile Workers' Union to organize collective welfare undertakings for workers.

The task of increasing the production of twenty-count yarn began in mid-October in various factories and had been successively exceeded by the end of November. According to statistics from state-owned cotton textile factories in various regions, the average excess completion rate was 116.23%. Specifically, East China completed 118.69%, North China completed 117%, Northwest China completed 105.99%, Southwest China completed 102.59%, Northeast China completed 102.87%, Qingdao China Textile Company completed 139.53%, Shandong completed 116.65%, and Zhejiang completed 123.98%.

In the production competition to increase the production of twenty-count yarn, in addition to conducting in-depth propaganda and mobilization to make workers understand the significance of increasing the production of twenty-count yarn for supplying rural needs and stabilizing the market, the factories also implemented the instructions of the Central Financial and Economic Committee, rationally issued wages, and paid attention to the health of workers. Pregnant female workers and weak workers did not participate in the competition this time. In addition to receiving extra wages equivalent to 150% of their original wages, other workers participating in the shock production increase also received nutritional subsidies. At the same time, the factory administration and the trade union also carried out propaganda and organizational work for the families of workers so that the workers could get good rest after returning home.

Because the factories took good care of the interests of the workers when organizing the competition, the enthusiasm of the workers for production was greatly improved. The national record of 1.22 pounds of yarn produced per spindle in twenty-four hours created by the workers of Shanghai State-owned Cotton No. 2 Factory appeared in this production increase competition.

　　全国各地公私棉纺织厂
    超额完成突击二十支纱任务
    【新华社三十日讯】全国各地公私棉纺织厂已先后超额完成政府交给的增产二十支纱的任务，为此，中央人民政府政务院财经委员会陈云主任于十二月二十五日写信给全国纺织工会，表示祝贺并颁发奖金五亿元，作为全国纺织工会举办工人集体福利事业的基金。
    增产二十支纱的任务于十月中旬由各厂开始执行，到十一月底止，即已先后超额完成。据各地国营棉纺织厂的统计，各地平均超额完成任务百分之一一六·二三。计华东完成百分之一一八·六九，华北完成百分之一一七，西北完成百分之一○五·九九，西南完成百分之一○二·五九，东北完成百分之一○二·八七，青岛中纺公司完成百分之一三九·五三，山东完成百分之一一六·六五，浙江完成百分之一二三·九八。
    在增产二十支纱的生产竞赛中，各厂除深入宣传动员使职工了解增产二十支纱对于供应农村需要、稳定市场的意义外，并执行了中央财经委员会的指示，合理地发给工资，并注意职工健康。凡怀孕女工和体弱工人这次都未参加竞赛。其他参加突击增产的职工除领到原工资百分之一百五十的加点工资外，还领到营养补贴费；同时工厂行政和工会并对职工家属进行了宣传组织工作，使职工回家后得到很好的休息。
    由于各厂在组织竞赛时对职工的利益照顾周到，职工生产积极性大大提高。上海国棉二厂职工创造的二十小时每锭产纱一·二二磅的全国空前纪录，就是在这次增产竞赛中出现的。
