Xinhua News Agency, 10th: Our correspondent on the Korean front reports: After the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers launched a new offensive on New Year's Eve of 1950, by the 7th of this month, according to preliminary statistics, they had annihilated over 10,000 American invading soldiers and Syngman Rhee's puppet troops, advancing over 300 li. After liberating Seoul, the Chinese and Korean People's Armies also liberated the cities of Suwon, Wonju, Yongin, Icheon, Yangpyeong, Cheongyang (Lipurri), Yeoju, and Hoengseong. Detailed battle results are currently being tallied.
    Xinhua News Agency, 10th: The heroic and resourceful fighting of the Chinese People's Volunteers on the Korean battlefield has terrified the American invading army. In a telegram on the 4th, a United Press correspondent accompanying the American army wrote in terror: "The Chinese are climbing over the mountains and attacking across snow-covered rice paddies. Like a river that has overflowed its banks and begun to spill into the lowlands, they are forming many small, winding streams of people along the lines of least resistance. They cut off the American companies from behind, surround them, and isolate them." The Chinese People's Volunteers are brave, but also resourceful. An American intelligence officer, Lieutenant Ambrose, said helplessly: "The Chinese army has a perfect way of hiding in the snow, a way of hiding that makes it impossible for aircraft to detect them."
    The American officers and soldiers, who have repeatedly fled in disarray on the battlefield, are very afraid of the "complete encirclement" tactics used by the Chinese People's Volunteers. A United Press reporter described the ugly scene of the American army being encircled and annihilated in one instance: Sergeant Krumste of the American 24th Division's company was guarding an outpost "very securely nestled between two other companies." However, the Chinese People's Volunteers launched a "flanking maneuver that even American officers had to admire," cutting off this company's "connection with other friendly forces." Krumste said in terror: "We had no idea where the Chinese came from." He said that they "hadn't even had time to fire a shot" before the Chinese People's Volunteers rushed to their side. "Before we knew it, the 'front line' collapsed, and we desperately fought our way to the rear. ... We couldn't carry the heavy weapons, so we destroyed them." A certain American corporal, Smith, fled in disarray with his mortar squad, and suddenly "saw four Chinese soldiers lying on the ground." Smith was so frightened that he couldn't even fire a shot, so he threw away his gun and ran. He "doesn't know where his gun fell," and "at the same time, his squad also ran away." Another corporal, Bardes, fearfully called this encirclement "the most terrible night of my life."

　　一九五一年新年新攻势中
    中朝人民部队歼敌万余   
    前进三百余华里光复原州利川等八城
    【新华社十日讯】本社朝鲜前线记者报道：朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军于一九五○年除夕发起新攻势后，至本月七日止，据初步统计，已共歼灭美国侵略军及李承晚伪军万余人，前进达三百余华里。中朝人民军队在光复汉城后，又解放了水原、原州、龙仁、利川、杨平、川阳（黎浦里）、骊州、横城等城市。详细战果现正清查中。
    【新华社十日讯】我国人民志愿军在朝鲜战场上作战的英勇机智，使美国侵略军胆战心惊。合众社随美军记者在四日的一条电讯中惊恐地写着：“中国人正爬过山岭，越过白雪盖着的稻田进攻。他们宛如泛滥了的河开始向低地溢出的那样，沿着最少抵抗的阵线，形成许多小河似的弯弯曲曲的人流。他们从背后切断了美军的连，把它们包围起来、孤立起来。”中国人民志愿军是英勇的，同时也是机智的。一个美军情报军官安布罗斯中尉无可奈何地说：“中国军队有一种隐藏在雪地里的十全十美的办法，那种隐藏的办法使飞机无法侦察到。”
    在战场上一再狼狈溃逃的美军官兵，对于中国人民志愿军使用的“整个包围起来”的战术，十分害怕。合众社记者描述了美军在一次被围歼时的丑态：美军二十四师军士长克姆斯泰的一连，据守在一处前哨阵地上，“非常安稳地夹在其他两个连中间”。但是，中国人民志愿军发动了一个“连美国军官也不得不佩服的两翼包围战”，使这个连“与其他友军的联系都被切断了”。克姆斯泰惊恐地说：“我们无从了解中国人是从那里来的”。他说：他们“还没有来得及开头一枪”，中国人民志愿军就冲到他们的身边了。“不一会儿，我们还没有摸清头脑，‘战线’就崩溃了，我们死命地向后方打去。……我们带不了重武器，因此我们就把它们破坏了。”一个美军下士斯密斯带着他的迫击炮班狼狈逃回时，忽然“看到四个中国士兵躺在地上”，斯密斯吓得连开枪都开不成了，于是扔掉枪就跑，他“不知道他的枪落在什么地方”，“同时，他那一班人也跑开了”。另一个下士巴德斯，把这次的被包围，惶恐地称为“我一生中最可怕的一晚”。
