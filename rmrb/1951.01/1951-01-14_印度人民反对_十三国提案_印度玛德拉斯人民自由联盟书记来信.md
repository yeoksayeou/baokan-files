　　Indian People Oppose the "Thirteen-Nation Proposal"
    --Letter from the Secretary of the People's Freedom League of Madras, India
    Dear friend:
    I request you to publish this letter in your newspaper.
    I am nearly sixty years old. When I was in the poor North Arcot district (note: in southern India), I deeply understood how terrible the damage suffered by the families who participated in the war was. This area was used as a conscription area for recruiting poor people for military service before and during the two world wars. In 1940, when I was preparing to leave my hometown, Kingudu Village, for Vanore (headquarters of the conscription area), my friend, a young doctor, came to see me and said that he had been drafted into military service. When he said that he did not like this profession, tears fell from his eyes; if he were allowed to decide for himself, he would participate in the peace movement; but circumstances forced him to participate in the war. His result was tragic, and he became one of the many war victims, never returning home.
    I was one of the many people imprisoned by the British imperialists in 1940-1941 for propagating "opposition to war." Now I am in charge of guiding the peace movement. Since the beginning of the Korean War, I have spoken many times at mass rallies throughout southern India, advocating that peace should be India's foreign policy. I vigorously criticized the opinions of Patel, Chairman of the Bombay National Congress, and Homorgan Carde, former Finance Member of the Indian Government, both of whom defended the policy of cooperation with the Anglo-American bloc. When I said that if India joined the American bloc, our country would be reduced to "Kurukshetram" (Indian language, meaning battlefield), the people respected my arguments.
    Our people know how the US government helped Chiang Kai-shek in the Chinese Civil War against the interests of the Chinese people. They also know that MacArthur provoked the war and sent troops to Korea to massacre the Korean people. They know that MacArthur said that he would have a proud look when he saw the corpses of the Korean people in Seoul. They know that American and British generals are only serving the interests of war profiteers, who get rich by selling arms and sacrificing their own people. Now our people will refuse to act as unconscious tools in the hands of war profiteers. They value the world peace movement supported by all progressive people in the world. The Indian people feel that they are linked with the Chinese and Korean people in the movement for independence and freedom.
    Knowledgeable, well-known and progressive Indian people support the position of Soviet representative Mr. Malik in the United Nations, opposing the thirteen-nation proposal calling for a ceasefire in Korea. They believe that this ceasefire proposal is an attempt to give the MacArthur army, which has suffered a disastrous defeat in Korea, a chance to breathe and reorganize in order to carry out another new offensive against the Korean people. Even those newspapers with pro-American views had to publish Malik's arguments. In this debate, it is quite interesting to look at the United Press news sent from London on December 13, 1950. The conclusion of the news reads:
    "The British and American leaders have completely changed their assessment of the situation in Korea. They now believe that the 'United Nations forces' will be able to stay indefinitely and may be able to continue their offensive to the north at an appropriate time."
    The conspiracy of the "Thirteen-Nation Proposal" is obvious, and the opposition of the Chinese and Soviet people to it is completely understandable.

### 印度人民反对“十三国提案”——印度玛德拉斯人民自由联盟书记来信

　　印度人民反对“十三国提案”
    ——印度玛德拉斯人民自由联盟书记来信亲爱的朋友：
    我请求你在贵报发表这封信。
    我将近六十岁了。当我在贫苦的北阿尔考脱区（按在印度南部）时，我深刻地了解到那些参加战争的家庭所受到的损伤是多么惨重。这个地区在两次世界大战以前与战时曾被作为征募贫民服兵役的征兵区。一九四○年，我准备离开我的故乡金格都村前往凡洛尔（征兵区总部），我的朋友，一个年轻的医生，前来看我，并且说他已被征入伍服役。当他说到他不喜欢这种职业时，泪水从他的两眼掉了下来；如果让他自己决定的话，他是会参加和平运动的；但是环境迫使他参加了战争。他的结果是悲惨的，他成为许多战争牺牲者中间的一个，永远也没有回到家里来。
    我是在一九四○至一九四一年因宣传“反对战争”而被英帝国主义者拘囚的许多人中间的一个。现在我正在负责指导和平运动。自从朝鲜内战开始以来，我曾多次在印度南部各地的群众大会上演讲，主张和平应该是印度的外交政策。我猛烈地批评孟买国民大会主席巴特尔与前印度政府财政委员匈莫干·卡德的意见，他们都是为与英美集团合作政策辩护的人们。当我说到如果印度参加美国集团，我们国家将要沦为“库鲁沙特拉姆”（印度语，即战场）时，人民是尊重我的论点的。
    我们的人民知道美国政府如何在中国内战中帮助蒋介石反对中国人民的利益。他们也知道麦克阿瑟挑动战争，派兵前往朝鲜屠杀朝鲜人民。他们知道麦克阿瑟曾说过，看到汉城朝鲜人民的尸体时他竟会发出得意的眼光。他们知道美国和英国的将军们只是为发战争财者们的利益而服务，这些人借贩卖军火与牺牲本国人民而致富。现在我们的人民将拒绝充当在战争暴利者手中的不自觉的工具。他们重视由世界上一切进步人士所拥护的世界和平运动。印度人民感到他们自己与中国与朝鲜人民在争独立争自由的运动中是联结在一起的。
    有知识的、著名的和进步的印度人民都支持苏联代表马立克先生在联合国中的主张，反对要求在朝鲜停火的十三国提案。他们认为这个停火建议是企图使在朝鲜已遭惨败的麦克阿瑟军队获得喘息机会与整编，以便进行另一次新的进攻，反对朝鲜人民。即使那些具有亲美观点的报纸，对于马立克的主张也不得不予以刊登。在此争论之中，看一下合众社于一九五○年十二月十三日从伦敦发出的新闻是颇饶兴趣的。该项消息的结论这样写道：
    “英美执政首脑已完全改变他们对于朝鲜形势的估计。他们现在相信‘联合国部队’将能无限期地停留下来并有可能在适当时候继续他们向北部的进攻。”
    “十三国提案”的阴谋昭然若揭，中国与苏联人民对它的反对是完全可以理解的。

                                       一九五○年十二月十六日
