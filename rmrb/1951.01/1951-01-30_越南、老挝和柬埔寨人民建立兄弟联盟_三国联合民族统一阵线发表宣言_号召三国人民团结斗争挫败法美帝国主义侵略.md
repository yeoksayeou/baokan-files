　　Xinhua News Agency, January 29th: Vietnam News Agency reports: Representatives of the national united fronts of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia held a three-day meeting in North Vietnam in the latter half of November last year to discuss the establishment of a joint national united front for the three countries. The conference adopted a declaration, the full text of which is as follows:
　　At a time when the democratic and anti-democratic camps in Indochina are engaged in fierce struggle, the world's peace fighters are holding the Second Peace Congress, the armed struggle of the people of Southeast Asia is achieving great development, the people and army of Vietnam have just won a great victory over the French imperialists, and guerrilla warfare is being widely launched in Laos and Cambodia, we are convening this meeting.
　　Based on the past and present experiences of the people of the three countries, and after careful analysis of the world situation and the situation in Laos and Cambodia, this conference has reached the following conclusions:
　　1. French imperialists and American imperialists are the common enemies of the three countries. In order to defeat this common enemy and achieve genuine independence and unification of the motherland, the people of the three countries must unite closely, help each other, and engage in a long-term struggle.
　　2. In the process of preparing for the Third World War, the imperialists, led by the United States, are planning to use Indochina as a military base for invading New China and suppressing the liberation movement in Southeast Asia. Therefore, the struggle of the people of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia is closely linked to the worldwide movement to defend peace. In order to achieve complete independence and unification, they must stand on the side of the peace camp and oppose the instigators of the Third World War.
　　After exchanging views, the delegates reached an agreement on the basic points of the common policy of the united front of the three countries, and formulated the following tasks:
　　(1) To rapidly establish an alliance between the peoples of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia on the basis of equality and mutual respect for national sovereignty and territorial integrity.
　　(2) The three countries shall fully support and assist each other to accelerate the complete liberation of the three countries.
　　(3) To help the people of the three countries eliminate the old national prejudices spread by the French imperialists; to protect the people from the deception and divisive plots of the French imperialists; and to oppose France's creation of mutual killings between the peoples of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia.
　　(4) We oppose the French imperialists' conspiracy to create puppets and tout false independence. We believe that any agreements signed by puppets of the three countries are invalid.
　　(5) Oppose any tendency to be complacent and underestimate the enemy, eliminate any fear of American imperialists, and help the people of the three countries understand the policies of their governments and national united fronts.
　　(6) Strengthen relations among all peace and democratic forces, first of all, to closely unite with the nations of neighboring Southeast Asian countries to establish friendly relations and alliances.
　　People and armies of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia! Patriotic organizations of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia! This conference is the first step towards establishing a brotherly alliance between the peoples of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. As President Ho Chi Minh pointed out, as long as there is such an alliance, all the evil conspiracies of the French aggressors and American interventionists can be thwarted, and the true independence and happiness of the people of our three countries can be achieved. In order to free the people of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia from the difficulties and sufferings caused by the French war of aggression, and to ensure the welfare and happiness of our children, we call on all the people of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia to unite more closely, to fight with greater strength and enthusiasm, when the French imperialists are sparing no effort to divide our people and prevent our liberation struggle, the unity among the peoples of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia is the most important prerequisite for them to achieve a thorough victory as soon as possible, and to establish independent, free, democratic, prosperous and strong countries.
　　Forward! People of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia!

　　越南、老挝和柬埔寨人民建立兄弟联盟
　  三国联合民族统一阵线发表宣言
　  号召三国人民团结斗争挫败法美帝国主义侵略
    【新华社二十九日讯】越南通讯社讯：越南、老挝和柬埔寨的民族统一战线代表于去年十一月下半月在北越举行了三天会议，讨论成立三国的联合民族统一阵线。大会通过一项宣言，全文如下：
    正当印度支那的民主与反民主阵营进行激烈的斗争，世界和平战士们举行第二届和平大会、东南亚人民的武装斗争获得巨大的发展、越南的人民和军队刚刚获得了战胜法帝国主义者的伟大胜利、游击战争在老挝和柬埔寨广泛展开的时候，我们召开了这次会议。
    本会根据三国人民过去和现在的斗争经验，精密地分析了世界形势和老挝、柬埔寨的形势，得出如下结论：
    一、法国帝国主义者和美国帝国主义者是三国的共同敌人。为击败这个共同敌人，获得祖国真正的独立和统一，三国人民必须紧密团结，互相帮助来进行长期的斗争。
    二、以美国为首的帝国主义者在其准备第三次世界大战的过程中，正在计划利用印度支那作为侵略新中国和镇压东南亚解放运动的军事基地。因此，越南、老挝和柬埔寨人民的斗争，是与世界规模的保卫和平运动紧密地联系在一起的。为了获得彻底的独立和统一，他们必须站在和平阵营一边，反对第三次世界大战的制造者。
    到会代表交换了意见之后，已对三国统一阵线的共同政策的基本要点获致了协议，并拟定了下列任务：
    （一）以平等和互相尊重国家主权和领土完整为基础，迅速建立越南、老挝和柬埔寨三国人民间的联盟。
    （二）三国互相全力支援互助，以加速三国的完全解放。
    （三）帮助三国人民消除法帝国主义者所散播的旧的民族偏见；保卫人民不使受到法帝国主义的欺骗和分裂阴谋的侵袭，反对法国制造越南、老挝、柬埔寨人民间的相互残杀。
    （四）反对法帝国主义者制造傀儡、标榜伪独立的阴谋，我们认为三国傀儡所签订的任何协定都是无效的。
    （五）反对任何自满和低估敌人的倾向，消除任何害怕美帝国主义者的心理，帮助三国人民明了自己政府及民族统一阵线的政策。
    （六）加强所有和平与民主力量间的关系，首先是与东南亚各邻邦民族密切团结，建立友好关系和联盟。
    越南、老挝和柬埔寨的人民和军队！越南、老挝和柬埔寨的爱国团体！本会乃是走向建立越南、老挝和柬埔寨人民间兄弟联盟的第一个步骤。正如胡志明主席所指出的，只要有了这种联盟，便可以挫败法国侵略者和美国干涉分子的一切罪恶阴谋，获得我们三国人民真正的独立和幸福。为了使越南、老挝和柬埔寨的人民摆脱法国侵略战争所产生的困难和苦难，为了保证我们的孩子们的福利和幸福，我们号召越南、老挝和柬埔寨的全体人民更加紧密地团结起来，以更大的力量和热情来进行战斗，当法帝国主义者正在不遗余力地企图分裂我们的人民、阻止我们的解放斗争的时候、越南、老挝和柬埔寨三国人民之间的团结，乃是他们及早获得彻底的胜利，并建立独立、自由、民主、富强的国家的最重要的先决条件。
    前进吧！越南、老挝和柬埔寨的人民！
