　　U.S. Imperialist Conspiracy Bankrupted Again
    Attempt to Entice Church Schools
    Lu Zhiwei and Others Have Refused
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Just as the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government was holding a conference in Beijing on handling foreign-funded universities, in accordance with the State Council's "Decision on Handling Cultural, Educational, and Relief Organizations and Religious Groups Receiving U.S. Subsidies," American imperialists once again engaged in sabotage activities using their usual shameless tactics. On January 16th, the New York-based United Board for Christian Colleges in China sent a telegram signed by McMullen to Lu Zhiwei, Chairman of the Yenching University Board of Trustees, Yang Deqi, President of Cheeloo University, Li Fangxun, Acting President of Nanjing University, Wu Yifang, President of Ginling College, and others. The telegram stated: "Fenn will be passing through Hong Kong in mid-February. We welcome the opportunity for you to meet or send a representative to discuss funding issues. The Board meeting will be held on the 19th. Please reply by telegram regarding the possibility." The presidents who received this telegram unanimously adopted an attitude of ignoring it and immediately reported it to the government. Lu Zhiwei, Chairman of the Yenching University Board of Trustees, said: We will not only ignore the U.S. imperialists' enticement this time, but we will also ignore it forever. Li Fangxun, Acting President of Nanjing University, said: Not only will I ignore this matter, but I have also told Nanjing University to immediately publish the telegram on campus so that all faculty and staff can see the shameless deeds of the U.S. imperialists. Wu Yifang, President of Ginling College, said: We will not only ignore this telegram, but we will also resolutely ignore any future enticements from the U.S. imperialists.

　　美帝阴谋又一次破产
    妄图利诱教会学校
    陆志韦等已加以拒绝
    【本报讯】正当中央人民政府教育部依照政务院“关于处理接受美国津贴的文化教育、救济机关及宗教团体方针的决定”，在京召开处理接受外国津贴的高等学校会议的时候，美国帝国主义者又以他一贯的无耻手段，进行破坏活动。纽约美国教会学校托事部，于一月十六日由麦克慕伦签名，打来了电报给燕大校委会主席陆志韦、齐鲁大学校长杨德齐、金陵大学代理校长李方训、金陵女子文理学院院长吴贻芳等，电文中说：“Fenn将于二月中旬路过香港，欢迎你有机会或派代表前往商谈经费问题。托事部会议于十九日举行，盼电复可能性。”接到这个电报的校长们，一致采取置之不理的态度，并立刻报告了政府。燕京大学校委会主席陆志韦说：对美帝的利诱，我们不但这次置之不理，而且是永远置之不理。金陵大学代理校长李方训说：我对这事不但置之不理，并且已经告诉了南京金大，要他们把电文立刻在校内公布，让全校教职员工看看美帝国主义的无耻勾当。金陵女子文理学院院长吴贻芳说：我们非但不理这个电报，而且对美帝今后的任何利诱，我们也坚决不理。
