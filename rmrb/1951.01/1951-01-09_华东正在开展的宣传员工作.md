　　The ongoing work of propagandists in East China
    Feng Gang

    In the current situation of resisting America, aiding Korea, protecting our homes, and defending our country, East China is carrying out the work of establishing a propagandist system and organizing a propaganda network. According to incomplete statistics from northern Jiangsu, as of mid-November, in Hai'an County (a newly established county centered on Hai'an Town), 11 of the 13 administrative districts and 44 of the 156 townships had organized propaganda networks, developing 457 propagandists; Yancheng County trained a total of 2,380 propagandists and organized 408 propaganda groups; in Taibei County (a newly established county north of Dongtai), 174 villages organized propaganda groups and developed 337 propagandists; Dongtai County had 114 townships and 659 villages establish propaganda groups, developing 1,862 propagandists; in Xin'an County (a newly established county on the Longhai Railway), 103 of the 11 districts and 108 townships had established propaganda groups, developing 268 propagandists; Shuyang County also developed 719 propagandists; according to statistics from Yangzhou City in early December, five propagandist teams have been organized, including 19 propaganda groups and more than 100 propagandists. According to statistics from the Zhaoxi Special District of Fujian, 1,238 propagandists were developed in September and October.

    According to reports from various regions, establishing propagandists has at least the following benefits: First, it has the broadest mass character, because propagandists come from the masses. Wherever there are masses, propagandists can be developed and propaganda networks can be organized. In this way, we can make up for the current lack of propaganda cadres and the inability of propaganda work to penetrate every corner. Especially in rural areas, where villages and populations are scattered, the propaganda force is weaker than in cities. Therefore, our past current affairs propaganda work was difficult to penetrate into the countryside. Now, with propagandists and propaganda networks, this difficulty is overcome. In Mingjiu Township, Shuyang County, northern Jiangsu, the peace movement could not be carried out before propagandists were developed. After the propagandists organized a propaganda network, the propagandists went deep into the villages, talked to each household, and conducted extensive and in-depth propaganda, mobilizing more than 2,300 people to sign in two days. The number of people signing for peace in Danfeng Township, Hai'an County, accounted for 64 percent of the total population of the township, which was also due to the extensive publicity of the propagandists. Second, this work is very organized. It can organize propagandists into a broad propaganda network by village and township, unified under a certain leading organization (it should be clearly stipulated: unified leadership by the Party organization - editor), so that according to the current situation, the center of work, the ideological situation of the masses, etc., can carry out planned and step-by-step propaganda work, so that each period has a certain propaganda center and a certain propaganda focus, and will not speak each other, mutual content is different or even mutually contradictory. For example, after developing propagandists in northern Jiangsu, the peace signature movement, the movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country, and combined with the then-current production and savings to prevent waste, land reform, and other work, propaganda was carried out in a planned and step-by-step manner, and the effect was very good. Taking the point of preventing waste as an example, in August and September, there was a so-called superstitious custom of "setting off fireworks" in the Hai'an County area, but after the propagandists publicized it, according to statistics from only one district of Hai'an County Lifaqiu, 46 fewer fireworks were set off, saving 14,720 catties of fine grain. Third, such propaganda work is the most in-depth. Because fully utilizing propagandists for propaganda is not only powerful and can penetrate every corner, but also, because propagandists are produced from the masses and have the closest relationship with the masses, they can best understand the thoughts and lives of the masses. Propagandists carry out propaganda based on the various ideological and living conditions of the masses, which can best touch people's hearts and achieve the greatest results. In particular, the current situation is changing rapidly, and the enemy is also spreading various rumors among the masses through special agents and traitors, so the masses will inevitably have various doubts. If we cannot address these specific doubts, but carry out general propaganda, it will become you say yours, he listens to his, making our propaganda work passive. After Zhang Hongcai was elected as a propagandist in Majiakou Village, Erqiu District, Huimin, Shandong, the masses immediately took the initiative to ask him "what is resistance to America and aid to Korea," and told him all kinds of rumors and doubts, so he immediately took the initiative in the propaganda.

            How to develop propagandists and establish a propaganda network

    The general principles for developing propagandists are, on the one hand, to have a broad mass character, and on the other hand, to "rather be precise than be too many," and pay attention to the quality of propagandists. Because propaganda work is a weapon, when the weapon is in our own hands, it can play the role of defending ourselves and attacking the enemy. If it is put into the hands of the enemy, it will become a weapon to attack us. If it is put into the hands of people who do not play a role, the effect will not be great. Therefore, in developing propagandists in various places, some conditions have been put forward according to local conditions. These conditions can be raised higher in some places and lower in others according to specific circumstances, but generally should not be raised too high, and there are several conditions that are basic, namely: (1) Political purity, active and responsible work, and upright character; (2) Contact with the masses and a certain prestige among the masses; (3) A certain level of political understanding and the ability to do simple propaganda (regarding the conditions for propagandists, the Party Central Committee decided to point out: They should have the necessary political awareness, lead by example in production labor and other work, contact the masses, and have the appropriate ability to carry out propaganda work - editor). Some areas did not pay attention to these basic conditions when developing propagandists, and problems arose in the work. For example, only propaganda ability was considered, and other conditions were not considered, and as a result, some people who could only talk empty words were selected, and even individual bad people mixed in. Some areas only required political purity, and as a result, the propagandists who were selected could not play a role.

    The specific methods for developing propagandists can also be used flexibly according to local and current conditions, and there is no need to have prescribed methods. For example, in the northern Jiangsu area, there are the following methods: (1) First, designate some Party and League members and mass activists in the Party, League branches, and mass organizations as the backbone of propagandists, and then gradually develop the organization from work. This method is suitable for the early stages of the movement. (2) It is produced by democratic election and leadership approval. For example, Yangzhou Middle School in northern Jiangsu held a meeting of the Youth League Student Union, and through studying the conditions, obligations, and rights of propagandists, mobilized everyone to democratically elect, and then approved by the leadership to become formal propagandists. This method is suitable for units or regions with a certain organizational foundation. (3) First understand the situation, determine the object, conduct planned training, and finally democratically pass the formal becoming a propagandist. For example, when Yangzhou Xingji Flour Factory developed propagandists, it was through the branch and the trade union to understand and study, determine the object, and then develop it. This method is suitable for units or regions where everyone's education level is not high and they want to do propaganda work but have no confidence. (4) First hire some temporary correspondents, and after the exercise and test of the movement, they will be promoted to formal correspondents. This method is suitable for general areas, and can train a large number of propagandists (propagandists can of course be recommended by the masses, but regarding the appointment of propagandists, it should be in accordance with the regulations of the Party Central Committee: After review and approval by the Party branch committee and approval by the higher-level Party organization - editor).

    At the same time as developing propagandists, they should be organized in a timely manner. The organizational form can be adapted to the people and the place, and various different organizational forms can be adopted, but there must be unified leadership in order to carry out planned and step-by-step propaganda work in a unified manner. For example, the propagandist organization in Yangzhou City is unified under the leadership of the Propaganda Department of the Municipal Party Committee, and then according to the specific situation, different forms of propaganda organizations are formed: such as in units such as factories and schools with an organizational foundation, the propagandists are assigned to the leadership of the Party branch, but they appear in the name of mass organizations in order to unite the broad masses; propagandists who can engage in more propaganda work in a certain period of time can be compiled into several propaganda groups or propaganda teams according to their nature or voluntary basis; some can also establish propaganda stations according to regions, Yangzhou City has nine central propaganda and mobilization stations and a number of grassroots propaganda and mobilization stations, and the grassroots propaganda and mobilization stations carry out work around the central propaganda and mobilization stations. In rural areas, the form of propaganda organization is different from that in towns and cities. For example, the situation of the propaganda organization in Houwang Township, Erqiu District, Huimin County, Shandong is that a propaganda group is established in villages with more than three propagandists, and the group leader is democratically elected. Villages with many propagandists can set up a chief and deputy group leader. Villages with less than three people in the propaganda group are merged into a propaganda group by two nearby villages. These groups are directly led by the township sub-station, and at the same time, they are also under the dual leadership of the Party branch at the same level. The township sub-station is also established by the township branch as the foundation and absorbing non-Party activists. (According to the county, the propaganda work is still in the stage of typical experiment and creation of experience, so the township sub-station is now directly guided by the Propaganda Department of the Prefectural Committee and the Propaganda Department of the county. In the future, the township sub-station should belong to the leadership of the district station, and the district stations are unified under the leadership of the Propaganda Department of the county.)

            The consolidation and education of propagandists

    When developing propagandists and after organizing them, we must always pay attention to solving their various ideological concerns. The more common ones are: fear of "not being able to do it," fear of "delaying production," and also the existence of personal plans, such as "raising their status," "being looked up to by the masses when they become propagandists," etc. If these problems are not educated, and they are not understood and corrected ideologically, propaganda work will not be done well. For these ideological situations, the main thing is to carry out education to serve the people, explaining that being a propagandist and doing a good job in propaganda work is a concrete manifestation of serving the people; at the same time, it is also necessary to carry out education with different contents according to their different specific thoughts and concerns, such as those who are afraid of "delaying production," explain to them that propagandists mainly combine propaganda with production anytime and anywhere, and will not delay family production; those who think that they have nothing in their stomachs and will not publicize to the masses, explain to him that after becoming a propagandist, their political and cultural level will gradually improve, and there is leadership from above, as long as they study hard, they will be able to do it in the long run; explain to the rural cadres who think that being a propagandist will increase the trouble that one of the frequent tasks of being a cadre is to do propaganda work for the masses. After serving as a propagandist, doing a good job in propaganda and education work for the masses will make other work easier... After such ideological education, the various ideological concerns of the propagandists can generally be eliminated.

    After the ideological concerns are eliminated, we must tell them how to carry out propaganda. Education and training generally adopt two methods: one is to strive for and seize the opportunity to gather the propagandists to listen to reports, ask questions, discuss, have discussions, answer questions, etc., in order to understand the problems that urgently need to be understood and simple propaganda methods, and after training, they are assigned to the following to carry out work; the other is to train while working, at the beginning, propagandists can be temporarily gathered together, and short-term intensive training can be adopted, as long as everyone recognizes several basic problems, they will be assigned to work, and the specific methods of propaganda and mobilization in this period should be created and enriched in practice.

    When propagandists are publicizing below, the most urgent request for leadership to help is to provide various propaganda materials. Therefore, the supply of materials should be timely, so that the propagandists have reason to speak below, and will not be depressed because they have nothing to do, but the materials issued should be formulated according to the level of the propagandists. In general, the content of each material should not be too much, so that the center is clearer, and the number of times the material is issued should be more, so that the propagandists always have new content to publicize. At the same time, the propagandists must first organize discussions about the materials to clarify the content and methods of propaganda, otherwise deviations will easily occur.

    The most frequent method of education and learning for propagandists is to establish a regular meeting system according to the group (or sometimes several groups are combined to hold larger meetings). At the meeting, on the one hand, they can study the key points in the current propaganda arranged by the higher authorities, and at the same time, they can study the specific situation of the group and formulate specific methods for how to carry out propaganda in the group, and then divide the work according to each propagandist. On the other hand, they can exchange the situation and experience of each propagandist to help each other learn. When establishing this meeting system, there are two ways in various places, which also produce two different results. One is that according to the situation of the propagandists, the propagandists discuss the meeting date, location, method, etc. by themselves. This meeting system can generally be held on time and persevered. The other is designated by the above and the learning date is uniformly stipulated, which is difficult to adhere to. Whether the propagandist group meeting can be adhered to is often the key to whether the propaganda group can be consolidated. Therefore, we must grasp the leadership of the meeting and make it a success, in which the group leader often plays a great role.

    After frequent education, the political and cultural level of the propagandists will gradually improve, and he will realize the benefits of becoming a propagandist. The leadership should point out these benefits in a timely manner and encourage them to make them more conscious and active in this work.

　　华东正在开展的宣传员工作
    冯岗
    在目前抗美援朝保家卫国的时事宣传中，华东各地正在开展着建立宣传员制度与组织宣传网的工作。据苏北一地不完全统计，截至十一月中旬为止，海安县（新设县，以海安镇为中心）十三个行政区、一五六个乡镇中，已有十一个区四十四个乡镇组织宣传网，发展了四五七个宣传员；盐城县共训练了二三八○宣传员，组织了四○八个宣传小组；台北县（新设县，在东台以北）有一七四村组织宣传组、发展了三三七个宣传员；东台县有一一四个乡镇、六五九个村建立宣传组，发展宣传员一八六二人；新安县（新设县，在陇海线上）十一个区、一○八个乡中，已建立宣传组的有一○三乡，发展了二六八个宣传员；沭阳县也发展了七一九个宣传员；扬州市在十二月初统计，已组织五个宣传员队，包括十九个宣传小组及百余名宣传员。又据福建兆溪专区的统计，在九、十两月间，即发展宣传员一二三八人。
    据各地反映，建立宣传员这一工作至少有下列几点好处：第一、就是它有最广泛的群众性，因为宣传员都是从群众中来的，只要有群众的地方，都可以发展宣传员和组织宣传网，这样，正可以弥补我们当前宣传干部缺乏，宣传工作不能深入到每一个角落的缺点。特别是农村中，村庄及人口分散，宣传的力量较城市更为薄弱，因此我们过去的时事宣传工作很难深入到乡村，现在有了宣传员与宣传网，这个困难就克服了。苏北沭阳县鸣九乡在没有发展宣传员以前，和平运动就不能开展，到发展宣传员组织宣传网后，各宣传员都深入村庄，逐户漫谈，进行广泛深入的宣传，两天就动员了二千三百余人签名。海安县丹凤乡和平签名的人数占全乡人口百分之六十四，也是得力于宣传员的广泛宣传。第二、这一工作又是很有组织性的，它可将宣传员按村按乡，组织成广泛的宣传网，统一于某一个领导机构（应该明确规定：统一由党的组织领导——编者），这样，就可以按当时的时局，工作中心，群众思想情况等，进行有计划有步骤的宣传工作，使各个时期都有一定的宣传中心，有一定的宣传要点，而不会各说各的，互相发生内容不同甚至互相抵触等情形。如苏北发展宣传员后，将和平签名运动，抗美援朝保家卫国运动，并结合着当时的生产节约防止浪费，土地改革等工作，作了有计划有步骤的宣传，其效果是很好的，即以防止浪费这点来说，八、九月中海安县一带有所谓“放焰火”的迷信风俗，但经宣传员宣传后，仅海安县立发区一区统计，即少放焰火四十六台，计节约细粮达一万四千七百二十斤。第三、这样的宣传工作，乃是最深入的。因为充分运用宣传员进行宣传，不仅力量雄厚，可以深入到每一个角落，特别是，因为宣传员都是群众中所产生的，与群众的关系最为密切，因此最能了解群众的思想与生活，宣传员根据群众各种不同的思想情况与生活情况来进行宣传，就最能打动人心，收效最大，特别是目前时局的变化很快，敌人也正在通过特务奸细等，在群众中散布各种谣言，群众就不免产生各种疑虑，我们如果不能针对这些具体的疑虑，而是作一般性的宣传，则会变成你说你的，他听他的，使我们的宣传工作陷于被动。山东惠民二区马家口村选出张洪才为宣传员后，群众立刻主动问他“什么叫抗美援朝”，而且把种种谣言和疑虑告诉了他，这样他在宣传中立刻取得了主动。
            怎样发展宣传员和建立宣传网
    发展宣传员的一般原则，一方面要有广泛的群众性，另方面又要“宁精勿滥”，注意宣传员的质量。因为宣传工作是一种武器，武器放在我们自己手里，就能发挥保卫自己打击敌人的作用，如果放到了敌人手里，就会变成进攻我们的武器，放在不起作用人的手里，作用也就不大。因此，在各地发展宣传员时，都因地制宜的提出了一些条件，这些条件可以根据具体情况，有的地方提得高些，有些地方提得低些，但一般不要提得太高，而有几个条件则是基本的，即：（一）政治纯洁，工作积极负责，为人正派；（二）与群众有联系，在群众中有一定威信；（三）有一定的政治水平，能作简单宣传（关于宣传员的条件，党中央决定指出：应当具有必要的政治觉悟，在生产劳动和其他工作中以身作则，联系群众，并有担任宣传工作的适当能力者——编者），有些地区在发展宣传员时不注意到这些基本条件，工作就出了毛病，譬如只顾到宣传能力，而不顾到其他条件，结果都选出了一些只会讲空话的人，甚至还有个别坏蛋混入其内，有些地区只要求政治纯洁，结果选出来的宣传员就不能起作用。
    发展宣传员的具体方法，也可以根据当地当时的情况灵活运用，不需要有规定的方法。譬如在苏北地区就有下述几种方法：（一）是先在党、团支部及群众团体中指定一些党、团员及群众积极分子为宣传员的骨干，然后再从工作中逐渐发展组织，这方法适用于运动的初期。（二）是由民主推选、领导批准的方法产生，如苏北扬州的扬州中学就是从青年团学生会召开会议，通过研究宣传员的条件、义务、权利等，发动大家民主选举，再经领导上批准，成为正式的宣传员，这种方式适合于有一定组织基础的单位或地区。（三）是先了解情况，确定对象，进行有计划的培养，最后民主通过正式成为宣传员。如扬州市兴记面粉厂发展宣传员时，就是通过支部和工会了解研究，确定对象，然后培养发展的。这种方式适合于大家文化程度不高，对宣传工作想做而无信心的单位或地区。（四）先聘请一些临时通讯员，经过运动的锻炼考验后，才提升为正式通讯员。这种方式适合于一般地区，且可锻炼出大批宣传员来（宣传员当然可由群众推荐，但关于宣传员的任命，应当按党中央规定：经过党的支部委员会的审查通过和高一级党组织的批准——编者）。
    与发展宣传员同时，就要及时的把他们组织起来。组织形式可以因人因地制宜，采取各种不同的组织形式，但是却要有统一的领导，以便统一的作有计划有步骤的宣传工作，譬如扬州市的宣传员组织，都统一于市委宣传部领导，其下则根据具体情况组成不同形式的宣传组织：如在各工厂学校等有组织基础的单位，即将宣传员归于党的支部领导，但又以群众团体的名义出现，以便团结广大群众；对若干可以在一定时期从事较多时间宣传工作的宣传员，又可按性质或自愿等编成若干宣传小组或宣传队；有的又可按地区建立宣传站，扬州市即设有九个中心宣传鼓动站和若干基层宣传鼓动站，基层宣传鼓动站环绕着中心宣传鼓动站进行工作。在农村里，宣传员组织的形式又与市镇不同，如山东惠民县二区后王乡的宣传员组织的情形，是在有宣传员三人以上的村庄，建立起一个宣传小组，组长由民主选举，宣传员多的村庄可设正副组长。宣传组不到三个人的村庄，即由两个靠近的村合并组成一个宣传小组，这些小组直接受乡的分站领导，同时又受同级党的支部的双重领导。乡的分站，也是由乡支部作基础吸收党外积极分子建立而成。（按该县宣传员工作还在典型试验创造经验阶段，故乡的分站现由地委宣传部和县的宣传部直接指导进行工作，以后，乡的分站当属于区站领导，各区站则统一于县的宣传部领导。）
            宣传员的巩固和教育问题
    发展宣传员时和组织起来以后，要经常注意解决其各种思想顾虑，较普遍的是：怕“干不了”，怕“耽误生产”，也有存在个人打算，如“为提高地位啦”“当了宣传员群众看得起啦”等等，如对这些问题不进行教育，从思想上弄通和纠正，就不会作好宣传工作。对他们以上这些思想情况，主要的是进行为人民服务的教育，说明当了宣传员，作好宣传工作，就是为人民服务的具体表现；同时，还必须根据他们不同的具体思想及顾虑，进行不同内容的教育，如对怕“耽误生产”的，向他们说明宣传员主要是随时随地的结合生产进行宣传，不会耽误家庭生产；对认为肚子里空，不会向群众宣传的，即向他讲明担任宣传员后，政治文化水平会逐渐提高，且有上级领导，只要好好学习，日久天长就干得了的；对认为做宣传员后增加麻烦的乡村干部，对他说明做干部的经常工作之一就是要向群众做宣传工作，担任宣传员以后，作好对群众的宣传教育工作，其他工作也就好做了……经过这样思想教育，宣传员的各种不同的思想顾虑，一般都能消除。
    思想顾虑解除以后，就要告诉他们如何去进行宣传，教育训练一般都采取两种办法：一种是争取和利用时机，将宣传员集中起来听报告、提问题、讨论、座谈、解答问题等，以弄通目前迫切需要了解的问题及简单的宣传方法为主，经训练后再分配到下面去进行工作；另一种是一边训练一边工作，开始时可以将宣传员临时集中起来，采取短时期的突击性的训练，只要使大家对几个基本问题认识后，即分配下去工作，至于这一时期的宣传鼓动的具体办法，则要在实践中创造与丰富起来。
    宣传员在下面宣传时，最迫切要求领导上帮助的就是供给各种宣传材料，因此，对于材料的供给应该及时，使宣传员在下面有道理好讲，不会因无事做而苦闷，但所发的材料，又要根据宣传员的水平来制订，一般的每次材料的内容不要太多，使中心更为明确，而发材料的次数要多，使宣传员时时有新的内容宣传。同时，宣传员对材料必须先组织漫谈讨论，明确宣传的内容与方法，否则易于发生偏差。
    宣传员的最经常的教育学习方法，乃是按小组建立定期的会议制度（或有时几个小组合并起来开较大型的会议），在会议上一方面可以研究上级布置的对于目前宣传中的要点，同时可以研究本组的具体情况，订出应在本组内怎样宣传的具体办法，再按各个宣传员进行分工，再方面又可以交换各个宣传员的情况与经验，以资互助学习。这种会议制度，各地在建立时又有两种方式，由此也产生两种不同结果，一种是根据宣传员的情况，由宣传员自行讨论出开会日期、地点、方法等，这种会议制度一般都能按时开会和坚持下去；一种是由上面指定，统一规定学习日期，这样做就难以坚持。宣传员小组会议能否坚持，往往是宣传组能否巩固的关键，因此，对会议要抓紧领导，而使它开好，其中小组长往往又起很大的作用。
    宣传员经过经常的教育，他的政治文化水平就慢慢提高了，他就会体会到自己当了宣传员后的好处，领导上应将这种好处及时的指出来，加以鼓励，使他们对这一工作更自觉而积极起来。
