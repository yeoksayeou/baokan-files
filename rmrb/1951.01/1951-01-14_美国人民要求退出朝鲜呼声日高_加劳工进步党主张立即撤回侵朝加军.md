　　Xinhua News Agency, 13th dispatch from New York (TASS, 12th dispatch): The call for ending the Korean War continues to rise in the United States. The Workers Daily reported that a thousand representatives, representing 40,000 warehouse workers and department store workers, unanimously demanded an end to the "massacre" in Korea.
    The Wheeling (West Virginia) News-Register reported that 91 percent of participants in a local public opinion poll favored the United States withdrawing troops from Korea. The Indianapolis Star reported that a public opinion poll conducted by a church in Burlington (Indiana) showed that 66 percent favored the United States "withdrawing from the current Asian battlefield."
    Xinhua News Agency, 12th dispatch from Ottawa (TASS, 8th dispatch): The Executive Committee of the Labour-Progressive Party of Canada issued a statement demanding that the Canadian government immediately withdraw Canadian troops from Korea as the first step towards the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea and a peaceful resolution of the Korean conflict. The statement said: "There is only one way to stop interfering in Korea, and that is: to withdraw foreign troops, accept China as a member of the United Nations, and implement a policy of non-interference in Korea's internal affairs. Continuing interference will only cause further bloodshed and loss of Canadian lives."

    【新华社十三日讯】塔斯社纽约十二日讯：要求结束朝鲜战争的呼声在美国继续高涨。工人日报报道，代表四万仓库工人及百货商店工人的一千个代表，一致要求结束朝鲜的“屠杀”。
    惠灵（弗吉尼亚州）的新闻记事报报道，在当地民意测验的参加者中，有百分之九十一赞成美国自朝鲜撤退军队。印第安纳波利斯的明星晚报报道，柏林敦（印第安纳州）的教会所举办的民意测验中，有百分之六十六赞成美国“自目前亚洲战场退出”。
    【新华社十二日讯】塔斯社渥太华八日讯：加拿大劳工进步党执行委员会发表声明，要求加政府立即撤回朝鲜加军，作为一切外国军队撤出朝鲜并走向和平解决朝鲜冲突的第一步。声明说：“要停止干涉朝鲜唯有一个办法，这就是：撤退外国军队，接受中国为联合国会员，并实行不干涉朝鲜内政的政策。继续干涉，只会造成进一步的流血，造成加拿大人生命的损失。”
