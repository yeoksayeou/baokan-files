Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 28th -- The experience of the Zhao Guoyou Workshop of the Shenyang No. 3 Machine Factory in carrying out production competitions has been warmly welcomed by trade union cadres and workers in various parts of Central-South China. On the 18th, Zhao Guoyou attended the Second Enlarged Meeting of the Preparatory Committee of the Central-South Federation of Trade Unions in Hankou and personally reported this experience to the meeting. After listening to the report, the representatives of the provinces and cities participating in the meeting unanimously agreed that these experiences pointed out the correct direction for the production competition movement in the Central-South region. Representatives from Wuhan City, after hearing the report, realized that one of the main reasons why the competition movement in most factories in the city could not be sustained was that the higher-level trade unions lacked regular propaganda, education, in-depth and concrete organizational leadership for grassroots trade union cadres and workers. Representatives from Jiangxi, Henan, Guangzhou and other places learned after listening to the report that cultivating typical groups and workshops and promptly promoting their experiences is a good way to lead the production competition. They all expressed their intention to promote these experiences well after returning to their factories. Du Laishun, a model worker and lathe operator from the Huazhong Iron and Steel Company's Machinery Factory, said after listening to the report: "In the past, we also studied the experience of the Ma Hengchang group and established various systems and mutual aid groups, but we did not have the regular inspection and improvement like the Zhao Guoyou Workshop, so many systems became a mere formality. In the future, we must learn from their experience, conduct regular inspections, solve problems at any time, and consolidate the systems."

　　赵国有车间先进经验
    受到中南职工热烈欢迎
    【新华社汉口二十八日电】沈阳第三机器厂赵国有车间开展生产竞赛的经验，受到中南各地工会干部和工人的热烈欢迎。十八日赵国有在汉口出席了中南总工会第二次筹委扩大会议，亲自向大会报告这个经验。参加会议的各省市代表听过报告后，一致认为这些经验，给中南区的生产竞赛运动指出了正确方向。武汉市代表们听了报告后，发现该市大部分工厂的竞赛运动所以不能持久，主要原因之一就是上级工会对基层工会干部和工人群众缺乏经常的宣传教育和深入具体的组织领导。江西、河南、广州等地的代表听了报告，了解到培养典型小组、车间并及时推广其经验，是领导生产竞赛的好办法。他们都表示回厂后要好好地推广这些经验。华中钢铁公司机械厂车工劳动模范杜来顺听了报告后说：“过去我们也学习过马恒昌小组的经验，建立了各种制度和互助小组，但是没有赵国有车间那样经常的检查和改进，所以许多制度流于形式。今后我们一定要学习他们的经验，经常检查，随时解决问题，把制度巩固起来。”
