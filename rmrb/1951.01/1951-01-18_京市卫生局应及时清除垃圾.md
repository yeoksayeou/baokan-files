To the Editor:

We have some opinions regarding the public sanitation of Beijing. Recently, all the residences in Yangrou Hutong, for example, have been filled with accumulated garbage. Because there is nowhere to dump it, we can only wait for the Health Bureau's garbage truck to come. However, from January 1st to the 14th, the garbage truck only came two or three times. Each time, the furnace ash from one or two households filled it up completely. As a result, many households have piles of furnace ash and other dirty things in their yards, and the sanitary conditions are very poor. If it weren't winter, it would be impossible to live here. Is this because there are too few sanitation workers, or is there another reason? We request that the Municipal Health Bureau quickly find a way to improve this situation.

We believe that the work of garbage workers should be inspected in sections throughout the city at any time. The time for garbage trucks to go to each hutong should be determined according to the amount of garbage in each street and hutong. In addition, several places for dumping garbage should be designated on each street according to its length, so that dirty things can be temporarily piled up when the garbage truck does not come.

### 京市卫生局应及时清除垃圾

　　京市卫生局应及时清除垃圾编辑同志：
    我们对于北京市的公共卫生有点意见。近日来如羊肉胡同所有的住宅都积存了满满的垃圾，因为无处倾倒只好等着卫生局的垃圾车来。但是，自一月一日起到十四日止垃圾车只来了两、三次，每一次有一两家的炉灰就装得满满的了。这样，有很多住家院中堆积着炉火灰等脏东西，卫生情况非常不好，如果不是在冬天真没有办法住下去。这是因为搬运工友少呢？还是有其他原因？我们要求市卫生局迅速设法改善这种情况。
    我们觉得应该在全市分段随时检查垃圾工友的工作情况，按各街各胡同垃圾多少的情形定出垃圾车到各胡同的时间。并应在每一条街按照长短指定几处倾倒垃圾的地方，在垃圾车不来时，临时堆集脏东西。
