　　Fourth Phase of Shu River Diversion Project Completed
    Celebratory Meetings Held in Upper and Lower Reaches; Welcome to the Laborers Returning Home in Glory
    [Report from this newspaper] The fourth phase of the Shu River (a tributary of the larger Shu River system) Diversion Project, of great significance, commenced successively from October 25th to 31st last year along the entire line. On the construction sections spanning over a hundred li, the entire project was completed ahead of schedule due to the two thousand cadres and two hundred thousand laborers unleashing a fiery patriotic labor emulation campaign with high labor enthusiasm.
    Since the start of construction, two hundred thousand laborers have overcome all difficulties with unparalleled labor enthusiasm, greatly improving work efficiency. For example, in terms of earth-splitting techniques, Fang Xueyi, a laborer at the Lanling Command Post, set a new record of splitting 44 cubic meters of earth in one day, while Liu Xiangfang from Ju County split 59 cubic meters of hard earth in one day; the Wulian Command Post also discovered Zheng Jisheng and Yang Lianfang, who split 90 cubic meters of earth in one day. Wang Shanting from Yi County even split 135 cubic meters of earth in one day. In terms of stone-splitting techniques, Zang Qizhen, a laborer from Mengyin, split 13 cubic meters of red gravel in one day, and Zhang Xiuhai even set a record of splitting 13 cubic meters of red hard rock; Yin Shangzhen from Yinan split 16 cubic meters of rotten stone in one day. Sishui also created the triangular stone-splitting method, with three people splitting a total of 50 cubic meters of stone in one day. In terms of blasting techniques, laborers from the Fourth Command Post (jointly organized by Mengyin, Yiyuan, and Mengshan counties) improved the method of drilling, increasing the depth of each hole from 1.2 meters, loaded with black powder, blasting 3 to 4 cubic meters of stone (if poorly blasted, only about 100 jin could be blasted), to drilling large holes 2.5 meters deep (small at the top and large at the bottom), loaded with 8 jin of iron rod explosives, setting an unprecedented record of blasting 98 cubic meters of stone in one blast. Under this high degree of labor enthusiasm, the progress of the project was greatly promoted. As a result, 25 command posts have successively completed or exceeded their tasks. The local masses enthusiastically erected pine arches, posted slogans, held meetings, and presented large banners to celebrate the laborers' victorious completion of their tasks and their glorious return home.
    Around December 20th, model award conferences were held in the upper and lower reaches of the diversion sections respectively. Command posts in Pingyi, Wulian, Feixian, Pi County, Yinan, Teng County, Linshu, Sishui, and Zhucheng were all honorably selected as model command posts.
    On December 24th, the Shu River and Yi River Management Committee solemnly held an award ceremony, presenting the model banners with the distinct words "Shu River Victory," "Conquering Nature," and "Shu River Vanguard" to the various model command posts. All units also successively held celebratory model conferences, in addition to awarding banners and certificates, and convened general meetings of all laborers, calling on the laborers to actively participate in anti-American aggression and aid-Korea propaganda work after their glorious return home, or to participate in land reform, production, militia, and public security work.

　　四期导沭工程全部完成
    上下河段开会庆祝，欢迎民工光荣返乡
    【本报讯】具有重大意义的四期导沭（沭河）工程，全线自去年十月二十五日至三十一日相继开工，在长约百余华里的工段上，由于两万干部、二十万民工以高度的劳动热情展开了如火如荼的爱国主义劳动竞赛，因此全部工程得以提前完成。
    开工以来二十万民工即以无比的劳动热情，克服了一切困难，大大地提高了工作效率。如在劈土技术方面，兰陵指挥所民工房学义创一天劈土四十四方的新纪录，莒县刘相芳一天却劈了硬土五十九方；五莲指挥所也发现郑吉升、杨连方一天劈土九十方。峄县王善廷一天却更劈土一百三十五方。在劈石技术方面，蒙阴民工臧其祯一天劈红碎石十三方，张秀海更创劈红坚石十三方，沂南尹尚珍一天又劈了烂石十六方。泗水又创造了三角劈石法，三个人一天共劈石五十方。在爆炸技术方面，第四指挥所（蒙阴、沂源、蒙山三县合编）民工改进打炮方法，由过去每炮打一米二的炮眼，装黑炸药，炸石三方到四方（炸不好只能炸一百斤左右）的水平，提高到打二公尺半深的大炮眼（炮眼上面小，底面大），装铁棍炸药八斤，一炮炸石九十八方的空前纪录。在这种高度的劳动热情下，大大推动了工程的前进。因而二十五个指挥所，纷纷完成或超出了任务。该地群众热烈地扎松门、贴标语、开大会、送大旗，庆祝民工胜利完成任务，光荣返乡。
    十二月二十日前后，上下游引河段分别召开评奖模范大会。平邑、五莲、费县、邳县、沂南、滕县、临沭、泗水、诸城等指挥所，都光荣地当选为模范指挥所。
    十二月二十四日，导沭整沂委员会又隆重举行授奖典礼，将“导沭优胜”、“战胜自然”、“导沭先锋”等鲜明的模范旗帜，分别奖给了各个模范指挥所。各单位也先后召开庆贺模范大会，除颁发奖旗奖状外，并召开全体民工大会，号召民工光荣返乡后，积极参加抗美援朝宣传工作，或参加土地改革、生产、民兵、保卫治安等工作。（王燕、恭三）
