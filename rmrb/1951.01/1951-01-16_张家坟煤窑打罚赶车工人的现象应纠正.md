To the Editor:

　　At the Zhangjiafen Coal Mine in Wajinwan, Datong Mining Area, the space is narrow, and there is nowhere to put the coal that is carried out, so it relies entirely on carts for transportation. As a result, two to three hundred carts are often crowded together day and night waiting to be loaded with coal. Recently, due to the coal output not meeting the demand, the cart drivers wait in the freezing weather, spending the night lying down around bonfires. Because of this, every cart wants to be loaded and leave early to suffer less from the cold. As soon as coal is carried out, the cart drivers scramble and fight, even arguing and brawling. The mine authorities do not want to thoroughly solve the problem, indiscriminately scolding and fining them, and even often dragging the cart drivers to the toilet for confinement. On the night of December 29th last year, when we passed by the mine, we saw Ma Zhizhong, a cart driver, being forced to kneel in the north wind by Tong Yi, a mine worker, for trying to load coal. Some coal carriers had their work point cards confiscated by the mine authorities for fighting with cart drivers over loading. Many cart drivers have been fined by the mine for injuring people while fighting to load coal. We hope that the person in charge of the mine will immediately correct such acts of infringing on human rights and violating government decrees through random beatings and fines. At the same time, a reasonable loading system should be established to change the current chaotic situation.

　　张家坟煤窑打罚赶车工人的现象应纠正编辑同志：
    大同矿区挖金湾张家坟煤窑，因为地方狭隘，背出来的煤没处放，完全依靠大车运输。因此日夜经常有二、三百辆大车拥挤在一起等待装煤。最近由于出煤量供不应求，车夫们在冰天雪地里等待着，夜里就围在火堆旁边横躺直卧地过夜。由于这样，每辆车都想早点装车走，少受些冻。只要一有煤背上来，赶车的便你争我夺，甚至吵嘴打架，矿方对此不想彻底解决办法，一味乱骂滥罚，甚至经常把车夫拉到厕所里禁闭。我们在去年十二月二十九日夜里经过矿上时，便看见赶车的马志忠因为抢着装车，被矿上工作人员佟义罚着跪在北风里。有的背煤工人因为和赶车的争夺装车，连计工的牌子都给矿上没收。车夫因抢装车砸伤人被矿上罚款的也很多。希望该矿负责人马上纠正此类侵犯人权、违反政府法令的乱打乱罚行为。同时建立合理的装车制度来改变目前这种混乱状态。
