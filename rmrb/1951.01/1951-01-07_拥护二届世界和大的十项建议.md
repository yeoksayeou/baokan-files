Ten Proposals Endorsing the Second World Peace Congress
　　Mao Dun

The Second World Peace Congress adopted two historical documents: "Declaration to the People of the World" and "Letter to the United Nations." The 1,756 representatives attending the Second World Peace Congress represented the vast people of 81 countries. These two historical documents expressed the unanimous desire of the vast majority of people in the world for peace and opposition to wars of aggression. These two major documents included a program of action to defend world peace, the main points of which are as follows:

　　I. Withdraw foreign troops from Korea, and peacefully resolve the Korean issue with the participation of Korean people's representatives; demand that this issue be resolved by the Security Council, including representatives of the People's Republic of China, and including all members. Stop the interference of the United States army in China's Taiwan and the war against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

　　II. Resolutely oppose the remilitarization of Germany and Japan, and resolutely demand the conclusion of peace treaties with a unified, demilitarized Germany and Japan, and the withdrawal of troops from the two countries.

　　III. Oppose colonial policies and oppose racial discrimination.

　　IV. Any political, strategic, or economic considerations, any reasons regarding the internal situation or internal conflicts of a country, cannot be used as an excuse for any country to armed interfere in another country. Regardless of any excuse, any country that first carries out armed intervention in another country is committing a crime of aggression.

　　V. Oppose the war propaganda of warmongers. Call on parliaments of all countries to pass laws guaranteeing peace.

　　VI. Investigate the massacres in Korea, and specifically question MacArthur.

　　VII. Unconditionally prohibit atomic weapons, bacteriological and chemical weapons, poison gas, radioactive weapons and other weapons of mass destruction; declare the government that first uses these weapons to be a war criminal; demand that major powers reduce their naval, land, and air forces by one-third to one-half progressively, simultaneously, and in the same proportion within 1951 to 1952; and implement control. An international control with supervisory powers should be established under the Security Council.

　　VIII. Restore normal trade relations between countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, and eliminate any form of economic discrimination.

　　IX. Promote cultural exchanges between countries.

　　X. Demand that the United Nations live up to the hopes placed in it by the people of the world and resolutely return to the principles upon which it was founded.

　　It should be pointed out that the above ten points also include the five specific proposals made by our delegation to the conference. After the closing of the conference, our delegation issued a statement in Warsaw, explicitly stating that the Chinese people resolutely support the two historical documents of the Second World Peace Congress, "and are willing to fully support the work of the newly established World Peace Council, and are willing to unite more closely with the people of other countries to fight to stop wars of aggression and defend world peace." The tenth meeting of the Central People's Government Committee (December 26, 1950) adopted a resolution on the ten proposals of the Second World Peace Congress, the full text of which is as follows:

　　The tenth meeting of the Central People's Government Committee listened to the report of Guo Moruo, head of the Chinese delegation to the Second World Peace Congress, on the work and resolutions of the Second World Peace Congress.

　　The Central People's Government Committee believes that the program for defending world peace expressed in the two historical documents "Declaration to the People of the World" and "Letter to the United Nations" adopted by the Second World Peace Congress is entirely in line with the will of the Chinese people and the people of the world, and has decided to fully support it, and calls on the people of the whole country to continue to work hard to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, unite international friends, carry out the just movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend the country, and strive to thoroughly implement the ten proposals of the Second World Peace Congress.

　　In order to support the call of our Central People's Government and thoroughly implement the ten proposals of the Second World Peace Congress, our literary and artistic workers must step up their efforts to expand and deepen the movement against wars of aggression and to defend world peace among the masses.

　　Defending world peace and opposing wars of aggression are two sides of the same coin. When wars of aggression are still in the active preparation stage, we must mobilize the power of the people to stop wars of aggression from happening; but when wars of aggression have already occurred, we must mobilize all our strength to extinguish the flames of aggression with a just war of self-defense. While the US imperialism is carrying out armed aggression against Korea, it is also invading our Taiwan, and has expanded the flames of aggression to our Northeast border. This shows that wars of aggression have already occurred and are expanding; in this situation, the Chinese people's sacred movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend the country, and the heroic fighting of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in Korea, is the most effective way to defend China, Asia, and world peace, and is also the most faithful implementation of the resolutions of the Second World Peace Congress. It is precisely because of this that our movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend the country has received enthusiastic support from the people of the world.

　　This is the basic point. Our literary and artistic workers must use their respective familiar literary and artistic weapons to carry out wider and deeper publicity among the broad masses of the people, and use vivid and concrete images to illustrate this truth.

　　Secondly, we must also use our respective familiar literary and artistic weapons, through vivid and concrete images, to praise all patriotic actions of the people, praise the great achievements of the People's Government in various construction undertakings, call on the people of the whole country to continue to work hard to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship (this is the greatest guarantee for our country's development and the freedom and happiness of our people), praise the loveliness of our motherland, the greatness of our nation, the achievements of our ancestors, the splendor and brilliance of our Chinese cultural traditions and their contribution to world culture—in short, praise everything that can further promote the people's patriotic spirit.

　　Finally, we must continue to expose the brutality and barbarity of the US military, the crimes of massacring innocent people and raping women; we must continue to point out that US imperialism is outwardly strong but inwardly weak, and that contradictions exist within the US-led aggressive camp, and that these contradictions are becoming increasingly acute; we must point out that the strength of the Soviet Union-led world peace camp is unprecedentedly strong and continues to grow stronger, while the strength of the US-led aggressive camp is weakening day by day; China's international status is unprecedentedly high, and the Chinese people's just actions to resist US aggression and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend the country are enthusiastically supported by the people of the world, while the United States' blatant reaction and frenzied aggression are hated and resisted throughout the world.

　　拥护二届世界和大的十项建议
    茅盾
    世界保卫和平大会的第二届大会通过了两个历史性的文件：《告全世界人民的宣言》和《致联合国书》。出席二届和大的代表计一千七百五十六位，代表八十一个国家的广大人民。这两个历史性的文件表达了世界绝大多数人民一致的要求和平、反对侵略战争的意志。这两大文件包括了保卫世界和平的斗争纲领，其要点如下：
    一、从朝鲜撤退外国军队，在朝鲜人民代表参加之下，和平解决朝鲜问题；要求这个问题应由包括中华人民共和国代表在内的，包括全体成员的安全理事会来加以解决。制止美国军队对中国的台湾的干涉，对越南民主共和国进行的战争。
    二、坚决反对德国和日本的重新军事化，坚决要求与统一的非军事化的德国与日本缔结和约，并从两国撤兵。
    三、反对殖民地政策，反对种族歧视。
    四、任何政治上的、战略上的、经济上的考虑，任何关于某一国家内部局势或内部冲突方面的理由，都不能作为任何国家武装干涉另一国家的借口。不论用任何借口，凡是首先武装干涉别国的国家，便是犯了侵略罪行。
    五、反对战争贩子们的战争宣传。号召世界各国的议会通过保障和平的法律。
    六、调查在朝鲜的大屠杀罪行，特别责问麦克阿瑟。
    七、无条件禁止原子武器、细菌和化学武器、毒气、放射性武器及其它大规模毁灭人类的各种武器；宣布首先使用这些武器的政府为战争罪犯；要求各大国在一九五一年到一九五二年之内，累进地、同时地，以同样的比例，裁减海陆空军三分之一到二分之一；并施行管制。应在安全理事会之下建立有监督权的国际管制。
    八、在平等互惠的基础之上，恢复各国间的正常的贸易关系，取消任何形式的经济歧视。
    九、促进各国间文化上的交流。
    十、要求联合国不要辜负世界人民所寄托给它的希望，坚决回到它所赖以建立的原则上去。
    应当指出，上举十要点中，也包括了我国代表团向大会所提出的五项具体建议。我国代表团在大会闭幕后，就在华沙发表声明，明确表示中国人民坚决拥护二届和大的这两个历史文件，“愿以全力支持刚成立的世界和平理事会进行工作，并愿与其他各国人民更密切地团结起来，为制止侵略战争，保卫世界和平而斗争。”我中央人民政府委员会第十次会议（一九五○年十二月二十六日）通过了关于第二届世界保卫和平大会的十项建议的决议，全文如下：
    中央人民政府委员会第十次会议听取了出席第二届世界保卫和平大会中国代表团郭沫若团长关于二届和大的工作和决议的报告。
    中央人民政府委员会认为第二届世界保卫和平大会所通过的表现于《告全世界人民的宣言》和《致联合国书》这两个历史文件中的保卫世界和平纲领是完全符合中国人民和全世界人民的意志的，决定予以完全的支持，并号召全国人民继续努力巩固人民民主专政，团结国际友人，开展抗美援朝保家卫国的正义运动，为彻底实现第二届世界保卫和平大会的十项建议而奋斗。
    为了拥护我中央人民政府的号召，彻底实现二届和大的十项建议，我们文学艺术工作者就必须加紧努力，把反对侵略战争、保卫世界和平的运动更扩大而深入到群众中间去。
    保卫世界和平与反对侵略战争是一件事的两面。在侵略战争尚在积极准备阶段时，我们要动员人民的力量制止侵略战争的发生；但在侵略战争已经发生的时候，我们就要动员一切力量，以正义的自卫战争来扑灭侵略的战火。美帝国主义在武装侵略朝鲜的同时又侵略我台湾，而且把侵略战火又扩大到我东北边境，这就是侵略战争已经发生而且在扩大了；在这样情形之下，中国人民的抗美援朝、保家卫国的神圣运动，中国人民志愿部队在朝鲜的英勇作战，就是最有效地保卫了中国、亚洲、以及世界的和平，也就是最忠实地实现了二届和大的决议。也正因为如此，我们的抗美援朝、保家卫国运动受到全世界人民的热烈支持。
    这是基本的一点。我们文学艺术工作者必须运用各自熟习的文艺武器向广大人民展开更扩大与深入的宣传，通过生动而具体的形象来说明这个真理。
    其次，我们又必须运用各自熟习的文艺武器，通过生动而具体的形象来歌颂人民的一切爱国主义的行动，歌颂人民政府在各种建设事业上的伟大成就，号召全国人民继续努力巩固人民民主专政，（这是我们国家的发展、我人民的自由幸福最大的保证），歌颂我祖国之可爱，我民族之伟大，我祖先之功业，我中国文化传统之辉煌灿烂及其对于世界文化之贡献，——总之，歌颂一切凡能更高度发扬人民的爱国主义精神的东西。
    最后，我们又必须继续暴露美军的残暴野蛮，屠杀无辜、奸淫妇女的罪行；必须继续指明美帝国主义的外强中干，美帝为首的侵略阵营内存在着矛盾，而且这矛盾是在日渐深刻化的；必须指出苏联为首的世界和平阵营的力量已经空前强大而且在继续强大，美帝为首的侵略阵营的力量则在日益削弱；中国在国际的地位空前地增高，中国人民的抗美援朝、保家卫国的正义行动受到全世界人民的热烈支持，而美国的露骨反动与疯狂侵略则在世界各地受到憎恨与反抗。
