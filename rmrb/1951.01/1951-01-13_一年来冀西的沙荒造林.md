Afforestation of Sandy Wastelands in Western Hebei Over the Past Year
By Wang Bo, Western Hebei Sandy Wasteland Afforestation Bureau

18 Million Trees Planted Annually, Eliminating Over 89,000 Mu of Sandy Wasteland

Under the strong leadership of governments at all levels and the close cooperation of the Western Hebei Sandy Wasteland Afforestation Bureau, the sandy wasteland afforestation movement in various counties of western Hebei has been vigorously carried out, and the enthusiasm and confidence of the masses in afforestation have gradually increased. In 1950, the five key counties of Xingtang, Xinle, Wuji, Gaocheng, and Zhengding alone completed the planting of 14,670,000 trees along sandy rivers, eliminating over 64,900 mu of sandy wasteland. Together with the afforestation achievements in Quyang, Lingshou, and Dingxian in the spring, a total of more than 17,920,000 trees were planted and over 89,000 mu of sandy wasteland were eliminated throughout the year. After the autumn of 1950, the five key counties completed the planting of more than 3,775,000 trees, eliminating over 13,800 mu of sandy wasteland, of which more than 2,170,000 trees were planted through public-private cooperation, covering an area of more than 8,000 mu.

The afforestation bureau's nurseries and entrusted county-run and private nurseries have cultivated more than 4,178,000 one-year-old seedlings of locust and purple spike acacia, of which more than 2,058,000 have been invested in public-private cooperative afforestation, solving the difficulty of tree seedling shortage in key sandy wasteland villages.

Due to the mastery of technology, the survival rate of trees planted in 1950 was greatly improved compared with previous years. According to the results of inspections in the above-mentioned five key counties, the overall average survival rate in spring was 90.8 percent, and the survival rate in the rainy season was 83.5 percent. Work efficiency has also exceeded previous years. For example, in Nan Gaoli Village, Xingtang County, each person planted an average of more than 230 pits per day last autumn, and in Nanhua, Zhengding, each person planted more than 160 pits per day, with a general average of about 130 pits. Windbreak forest networks and belts were built in a planned way, adhering to the principle of "dense planting." In public-private cooperative afforestation, the spacing between plants and rows generally reached three feet, and other afforestation generally reached five feet.

Last autumn, the masses were organized to carry out public-private cooperative afforestation and sign afforestation contracts. Stocks were issued after the end of afforestation, which further consolidated the masses' confidence in afforestation. In terms of organization, attention was paid to starting from small-scale efforts, consolidating grassroots organizations for large-scale cooperation, and strengthening group leadership. The masses reflected that only voluntary combination and clear shares can be reasonable.

Strengthening Leadership and Closely Integrating with Various Tasks are Essential for Smoothly Completing Afforestation Work

Experience over the past year has shown that only by strengthening leadership and closely integrating with various aspects and tasks can afforestation work be better completed. Before each afforestation season, the Ministry of Forestry and Land Reclamation, the province, the special commissioner's office, and the county governments all successively implemented the policy of forest protection and afforestation at a series of meetings. The afforestation work was also arranged at the labor model conferences held in various counties last autumn. The Afforestation Bureau also participated in the model selection conferences in Xingtang, Xinle, Zhengding, and Gaocheng counties with forestry exhibits. Before the start of afforestation, joint village afforestation meetings were held in key areas to strengthen forestry publicity work in many ways. Key counties and districts have established afforestation work groups every season to uniformly lead the afforestation work. During the autumn afforestation, County Chief Ma of Xingtang County wrote letters to forestry labor models to encourage them. County Committee Member Wang, County Chief Li of Xinle County, and District Chief Wang of the Second District, etc., supervised and urged the afforestation work at any time. Various special commissioners' offices, counties, and districts have equipped themselves with professional cadres, combined with 133 students from the Department of Forestry of Beijing Agricultural University, forestry schools, forestry training classes, and cadres undergoing practical training at the Afforestation Bureau, and went deep into key villages to organize and mobilize the masses to teach the masses to master technology, which played a great role in carrying out afforestation work and implemented the production leadership policy of "organization first, technology second."

Afforestation work should be closely integrated with other central tasks. Last autumn, the leading organs of Xingtang, Xinle, and other counties clearly proposed that afforestation work should be given equal importance with autumn grain collection and autumn plowing. Village cadres in key villages were assigned tasks. Responsible comrades from Xingtang, Xinle, and other counties personally went deep into key villages to lead afforestation in conjunction with autumn grain collection and created good models of cooperative afforestation. During the autumn afforestation, comrades from the work group used their rest time in the fields to explain current events to the masses, arousing the masses' enthusiasm for resisting the United States and aiding Korea, and proposed to resist the United States and aid Korea with practical actions of afforestation for disaster prevention and increased production. Work efficiency increased rapidly.

How to strengthen forest protection work is an important issue. In Dong Citing Village, Zhengding, before afforestation, the saboteur Wang Heidan was dealt with, which encouraged the masses' confidence in forest protection. After the completion of afforestation in Huangjia Village, Xinle, activists led the masses to form a tree protection organization, launching a mass forest protection movement.

Public-Private Cooperative Afforestation is Deeply Welcomed by the Masses

In the case of large areas of sandy wasteland and lack of tree saplings, organizing the masses for public-private cooperative afforestation is a good method. The masses said: As long as there are tree saplings, it is not difficult to eliminate sandy wasteland. Last autumn, the Afforestation Bureau took tree saplings to cooperate with the masses, distributing dividends according to the ratio of 30% for the public and 70% for the private, and signed afforestation contracts. Stocks were issued after the end of afforestation. The enthusiasm of the masses was extremely high. However, when launching public-private cooperative afforestation, it is necessary to carry out publicity and deliberation as early as possible, explain the methods of public-private cooperative afforestation, and mobilize through activists, emphasizing voluntary combination, in order to consolidate the organization and improve the survival rate. At the same time, when designing forest networks and belts, it is necessary to closely integrate with the interests of the masses in order to mobilize the masses to participate voluntarily. The general masses requested to block the wind vents first to protect arable land, and then build windbreak forest networks. When planning the forest network, it is necessary to take care of private arable land and not divide the arable land. The farmers said that this afforestation (referring to the forest network) method is good, because it can not only eliminate wasteland but also cultivate land, and in the future, it can also engage in orchards. The government is really serving the people. In large-scale public-private cooperative afforestation, mastering technology is very important. The techniques of digging pits, placing seedlings, and burying soil should be taught to the masses in the fields first, and the group leaders should be responsible for checking and mastering them in order to be neat and uniform. Scientific division of labor (seedling planting group, pit digging group, etc.) should be carried out in the group, and competitions should be launched to improve work efficiency.

Timely Resolution of Sandy Wasteland Land Rights Issues

In carrying out large-scale afforestation movements, the most important thing is to resolve the issue of land rights in sandy wastelands in a timely manner. Because afforestation work is gradually being carried out, sandy wastelands are valued by the masses, and land rights disputes in sandy wastelands are increasing. If the land rights issues are not resolved first, afforestation will be very difficult.

In 1950, in the afforestation work, combined with the Shijiazhuang and Dingxian special commissioner's offices and Xinle, Zhengding, Xingtang, and other counties, the land boundary disputes of six villages including Nanhua and Dong Citing were resolved, mainly by adopting a method of consultation by the masses under leadership. The specific method is: according to the land area, population, and economic conditions of both villages, with reference to the old boundaries proposed by each village, representatives are elected by the masses to negotiate the division. Experience has shown that the best time to deal with land rights issues is in the winter and spring seasons or before afforestation.

Several Issues Worth Noting

(1) Over the past year, in various places, most areas have focused more on deployment and less on inspection of forest protection work, or only paid attention to it during the afforestation season. After the afforestation was completed, no one cared about it. At the same time, the awards only focused on rewarding those who carried out afforestation. Some counties and districts have failed to deal with incidents of damage to trees in a timely manner, which has affected the masses' enthusiasm for afforestation. In the future, the principle of "forest protection as the mainstay" should be clarified to strengthen forest protection work, and inspections should be carried out in a focused manner through administrative departments.

(2) Cultivating afforestation and forest protection models should be regarded as regular work. Strengthen contact with labor models, help them solve difficulties, improve technology, and discover and cultivate activists at any time, so that they can more closely connect with the masses and widely carry out the afforestation movement.

(3) Strengthen the professional learning of forestry cadres or provide rotational training for afforestation labor models in order to spread technology to the masses.

(4) Mobilize private individuals to run nurseries or organize private individuals to raise funds to purchase tree saplings to solve the difficulty of tree sapling shortages from multiple aspects, so that afforestation work can be fully carried out.

　　一年来冀西的沙荒造林
    冀西沙荒造林局  王波
    全年植树一千八百万株，消灭沙荒八万九千余亩
    在各级政府的大力领导及冀西沙荒造林局的密切配合下，冀西各县沙荒造林运动蓬勃开展，群众造林情绪与信心逐步增高。一九五○年仅行唐、新乐、无极、藁城、正定等五个重点县，即完成沙荒沿河造林一千四百六十七万株，消灭沙荒达六万四千九百多亩；加上曲阳、灵寿、定县春季造林成绩，全年共植树造林一千七百九十二万多株，消灭沙荒八万九千余亩。一九五○年秋后，五个重点县即完成植树造林三百七十七万五千多株，消灭沙荒达一万三千八百多亩，其中公私合作造林为二百十七万多株，面积为八千多亩。
    造林局苗圃与委托县营、私营苗圃共育成洋槐、紫穗槐等一年生苗木四百十七万八千多株，其中二百零五万八千多株，已投资公私合作造林，解决了沙荒重点村树苗缺乏的困难。
    由于掌握了技术，一九五○年植树成活率较往年大大提高。根据上述五个重点县检查的结果，总平均春季成活百分之九十点八，雨季成活百分之八十三点五。工作效率也超过往年，如行唐县南高里村去秋每人每日平均栽二百三十余穴，正定南化每人日栽一百六十多穴，一般平均栽一百三十穴左右；并有计划地建造防风林网、林带，作到了“密植”的原则。公私合作造林株行普遍作到距离三尺，其他造林一般也作到五尺。
    去秋组织群众开展了公私合作造林与群众订立造林合同。造林结束发给股票，更加巩固了群众的造林信心。在组织方面，注意了从小型做起，巩固大型合作的基层组织，加强小组领导。群众反映：只有自愿组合，明确股份，才能合理。
    加强领导，紧密结合各种工作，才能顺利完成造林工作
    一年来的经验证明，只有加强领导，在各方面与各种工作密切结合，才能更好地完成造林工作。每季造林前，林垦部、省、专署、县各级政府均先后于一系列的会议上贯彻护林造林政策。各县在去秋召开的劳动模范大会上也布置了造林工作。造林局并携带林业展览品参加行唐、新乐、正定、藁城四县评选模范大会。造林开始前，各重点区都召开了联村造林会议，多方面加强了林业宣传工作。重点县、区，每季均成立造林工作组，统一领导造林工作。秋季造林中，行唐县马县长，曾给林业劳动模范写信予以鼓励。新乐县王县委、李县长及二区王区长等随时指导督促造林工作。各专、县、区都配备了专业干部，结合北京农业大学森林系、林专、林训班和造林局干部练习生共一百三十三人，深入重点村，组织发动群众教导群众掌握技术，对开展造林工作起了很大作用，执行了“组织第一，技术第二”的生产领导方针。
    造林工作应当与其他中心工作密切结合进行。去秋行唐、新乐等县领导机关都明确提出造林工作应与秋征秋耕工作并重，各重点村村干部都分了工。行唐、新乐等县负责同志，曾亲自深入重点村，结合秋征工作领导造林，并创造了很好的合作造林典型。秋季造林中，工作组同志们利用地头休息时间，向群众讲解时事，激起了群众抗美援朝的热情，提出：要以造林防灾、增加生产的实际行动抗美援朝。工作效率迅速提高。
    如何加强护林工作是一个重要问题。正定东慈亭村在造林前处理了破坏分子王黑蛋，鼓舞了群众护林信心。新乐黄家庄在造林完毕通过积极分子带动群众组成了护树组织，掀起群众性的护林运动。
    公私合作造林，深得群众欢迎
    在大面积的沙荒及树秧缺乏的情况下，组织群众公私合作造林是良好的方法。群众说：只要有树苗，消灭沙荒不难。造林局在去秋即拿树苗与群众合作，按公三私七分红，订立了造林合同，造林结束后填发了股票。群众情绪极为高涨。但在发动公私合作造林时，必须及早进行宣传酝酿，讲明公私合作造林的办法，通过积极分子带动，强调自愿结合，才能巩固组织，提高成活率。同时，设计林网、林带时，要与群众利益密切结合，才能发动群众自愿参加。一般群众要求先堵风口，保护耕地，再造防风林网。在规划林网时要照顾到私人耕地，不要使耕地分割开。农民说，这种造林（指林网）办法好，又能灭荒又能种地，将来还可以闹果园，政府真是为人民服务。大规模的公私合作造林中，掌握技术很要紧。应当利用地头先把挖坑、放秧、埋土等技术教给群众，由小组长负责检查掌握，才能整齐划一；小组中要科学分工（放秧组、挖坑组等），展开竞赛，才能提高工作效率。
    及时解决沙荒地权问题
    开展大规模的造林运动中，最主要的是及时处理沙荒地权问题。因为造林工作日渐开展，沙荒被群众重视，沙荒地权纠纷愈来愈多，如不先解决地权问题，造林就会很困难。
    一九五○年在造林工作中，结合石家庄、定县两专署及新乐、正定、行唐等县解决了南化、东慈亭等六个村的地界纠纷，主要是采取有领导的通过群众以协商办法来处理的。具体办法是：根据双方村的土地面积、人口、经济状况，参照各村提出的旧界，由群众选出代表，协商划分。经验证明：处理地权问题的时间，在冬春季节或造林前为好。
    值得注意的几个问题
    （一）一年来各地对护林工作，大部地区是布置多、检查少，或只是造林季节引起了重视，造林完了，没人过问。同时在奖励上只着重奖励造林者。有些县、区对破坏林木事件没能随时处理，影响了群众的造林情绪。今后应明确“护林为主”的方针以加强护林工作，并通过行政部门有重点地进行检查。
    （二）培养造林护林模范，应视为经常工作。加强与劳动模范联系，帮助他们解决困难，提高技术，随时发现培养积极分子，使能更密切地联系群众，广泛地开展造林运动。
    （三）加强林业干部的业务学习，或轮训造林劳动模范，以便把技术推广到群众中去。
    （四）发动私人办苗圃，或组织私人集资购买树苗，从多方面解决树秧困难，使造林工作，得以全面开展。
