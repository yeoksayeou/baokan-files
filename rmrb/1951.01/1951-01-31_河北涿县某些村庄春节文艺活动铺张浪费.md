　　In Zhuoxian County, Hebei Province, since the launch of Spring Festival literary and artistic activities, many villages have experienced serious waste phenomena such as levying grain from the masses. Lanjiaying Village in the Sixth District sold more than twenty trees left over from the land reform for twenty-one dan of corn; the whole village of two hundred and six households levied five dan of corn, 1.96 million yuan, and more than 20,000 jin of sweet potatoes. Village cadres took the lead, spending hundreds of jin of grain each month to hire teachers to rehearse old dramas with feudal toxins. In the past two months, burning coal, using oil, repairing gas lamps, building stages, buying costumes, props, knives, guns, etc., have left them with only a little more than 100,000 yuan. Daquan Village levied 24 dan and 9 dou of rice from the masses and bought costumes, props, knives, and guns. Da Wu Village sold ten victory fruit trees for more than 2 million yuan. Three teachers were hired to specialize in learning stilts. Yongle Village sold the fruits of victory from the land reform, two carts, three mules, and a horse, to purchase costumes, and also levied from the masses, with each middle peasant family having to pay 40,000 yuan. At present, this serious waste phenomenon is developing in many villages. Why is this phenomenon occurring? The main reason is that the county government's Culture and Education Section did not clearly state the prevention of extravagance and waste when arranging Spring Festival literary and artistic activities, and some village cadres forced the masses to apportion grain and funds, and the masses were afraid to raise objections. For example, the village chief of Lanjiaying Village, Xu Wanlin, said to the masses: "Whoever disagrees, come out and face me." When the government discovered that some villages were apportioning grain and wasting resources, it did not correct them in time, so that more villages followed suit.
　　We believe that the county and district leadership should promptly inspect this issue, correct the village cadres' apportionment of grain and funds, and persuade the masses not to waste resources.

　　河北涿县某些村庄春节文艺活动铺张浪费
    河北省涿县自开展春节文艺活动以来，不少村庄发生了向群众摊敛粮食等严重的浪费现象。六区兰家营村将土地改革时剩下的二十多棵树，卖了二十一石玉米；全村二百零六户，收敛了玉米五石、一百九十六万元、两万余斤白薯。村干部领头，每月化几百斤粮食请来教师，排练带封建毒素的旧剧。两月来烧煤，用油，修理汽灯，搭戏棚，买靠、?、刀、枪等，用得只剩下十万多块钱。大泉村向群众摊敛二十四石九斗大米，买了靠，?，刀，枪。大吴村十棵胜利果树卖了二百多万元。请了三个教师，专门学高跷。永乐村将土地改革的胜利果实两辆排子车、三头骡子、一匹马卖了，置行头，另外还向群众摊敛，一家中农就要出四万元。目前此种严重的浪费现象正在不少村庄发展着。为什么会发生这种现象呢？主要是因为县政府文教科在布置春节文艺时，对于防止铺张浪费没有明确地提出，有的村村干部便强迫向群众摊粮派款，群众反对也不敢提意见。如兰家营村村长徐万林向群众说：“谁不服出来碰碰。”政府发现有些村子向群众摊敛、浪费的情形，亦未及时纠正，以致更多的村子也跟着学起来。
    我们认为：县、区领导上对此问题应及时检查，纠正村干部的摊粮、派款行为，说服群众不要浪费。
