    [Xinhua News Agency, 17th] Catholics in Baoding City held a rally and parade on the 14th to resist America and aid Korea, protect our homes and defend the country.

At the meeting, Luo Bobin, acting bishop of the Catholic General Church, reported on the significance of the Chinese Catholic Church implementing self-reliance and renovation.

Subsequently, priests Ren Sizhi and others spoke one after another, unanimously calling on Catholics to resolutely sever ties with imperialism, participate in the movement to resist America and aid Korea, protect our homes and defend the country, and at the same time, to heighten vigilance and strictly guard against all imperialist elements and their agents' conspiracies of provocation and sabotage.

    【新华社十七日讯】保定市天主教人士于十四日举行了抗美援朝保家卫国大会和游行，并在会上通过了革新宣言。参加大会和游行的有：保定天主教总堂代理主教骆伯宾、司铎任司直、陈良、马雅伯、韩度等，若瑟修女院院长李凤斋、南关公教医院院长吕渭公、西关公教育婴院院长师耀灵以及教徒、修女、教会学校学生共六百多人。会上，天主教总堂代理主教骆伯宾报告了中国天主教实行自立革新的意义。他说：“美帝国主义疯狂地侵略朝鲜，侵占我国领土台湾、轰炸东北。我们为了保家卫国，必须坚决反对美帝国主义，与帝国主义割断联系，实行自治、自养、自传，使中国的天主教完全不受制于帝国主义。”接着，司铎任司直等先后讲话，一致号召天主教徒要坚决与帝国主义割断联系，参加抗美援朝保家卫国运动，同时要提高警惕、严防一切帝国主义分子及其代理人的挑拨破坏阴谋。最后，全体一致通过了天主教爱国革新宣言。
