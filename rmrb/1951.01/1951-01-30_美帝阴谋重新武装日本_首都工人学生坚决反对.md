　　U.S. Imperialism Conspires to Re-arm Japan
    Workers and Students in the Capital Firmly Oppose It

    [Reported by this newspaper] The news that U.S. imperialism is plotting to arm Japan again has aroused great anger among workers and students in Beijing. They unanimously believe that the purpose of U.S. imperialism in re-arming Japan is to invade China and the people of Asia.

    On the afternoon of the 28th, the Beijing Automobile Company Trade Union held a forum, and the workers who attended expressed their opinions one after another. The chairman of the trade union, Gao Feng, pointed out: "Now that U.S. imperialism is eager to conclude a separate peace treaty with Japan, it is because it has suffered a decisive defeat on the Korean battlefield. Today, U.S. imperialism's plan of aggression has completely failed, and its last move is to arm West Germany in Europe and arm Japan in Asia. Arming West Germany has been opposed by the people of the whole of Europe and is about to fail; arming Japan will also fail! Now U.S. imperialism is making its last struggle. We must be more vigilant and work harder in order to completely defeat U.S. imperialism." The workers who participated in the forum decided to publicize the conspiracy of U.S. imperialism to conclude a separate peace treaty with Japan to other workers and their families, and expressed their intention to further carry out the patriotic production competition. Lu Yuntai, a model worker from the Trolley Car Repair Factory, said: "When the Japanese devils ruled Beijing, the suffering of the workers was unspeakable. Today, U.S. imperialism is re-arming Japan, and the Chinese people who have stood up will never allow it!" The Beijing District Committee of the China Telecommunications Trade Union issued a statement saying: The Chinese people will never allow the days of being ravaged by the Japanese devils to return. We demand the conclusion of a comprehensive and just peace treaty with Japan to end the dictatorial rule of U.S. imperialism in Japan.

    Although schools above the capital's specialist level are holding examinations, students are still paying close attention to the conspiracy of U.S. imperialism to attempt to conclude a separate peace treaty with Japan, and have discussed this. Students unanimously believe that the conspiracy of U.S. imperialism to re-arm Japan is a direct threat to peace in Asia and the world. Cheng Xianze, chairman of the Peking University Student Union, said: "After suffering a defeat in Korea, U.S. imperialism hurriedly wants to conclude a separate peace treaty with Japan. This fully demonstrates the weakness and stupidity of U.S. imperialism. We firmly believe that the Chinese people, the Japanese people, the people of Asia, and the people of the world will definitely be able to defeat this shameless conspiracy of U.S. imperialism." The students of Beijing Normal University exposed this conspiracy of U.S. imperialism in wall newspapers and blackboard newspapers. They unanimously support Foreign Minister Zhou's statement of December 4 last year regarding the peace treaty with Japan. The students of Beijing Railway College studied the editorial of the 28th in this newspaper and launched a discussion. They believe that although U.S. imperialism has failed on the Korean battlefield, it still wants to continue its aggressive policy, and re-arming Japan is clear evidence. At the current affairs discussion meeting of the fourth grade of the Department of Physics of Tsinghua University, the students unanimously agreed that a movement against U.S. imperialism's unilateral peace treaty with Japan should be launched throughout the country. Xu Bingxin, chairman of the Fu Jen Catholic University Student Union, said: "The Chinese people, who won victory after eight years of arduous war of resistance against Japan, resolutely oppose U.S. imperialism's separate peace treaty with Japan, and the conspiracy of U.S. imperialism to arm Japan will definitely fail!" The trade union of Beijing Municipal Third Middle School expressed its infinite anger in a letter to this newspaper about Dulles' arrival in Japan to instigate a separate peace treaty with Japan.

　　美帝阴谋重新武装日本
    首都工人学生坚决反对
    【本报讯】美帝国主义正阴谋武装日本的消息，引起了北京市工人、学生的极大愤怒。一致认为美帝重新武装日本的目的，是侵略中国和亚洲人民。
    二十八日下午，北京市汽车公司工会举行座谈会，到会工人纷纷发表意见，工会主席高峰指出：“现在美帝急于单独对日媾和，是因为他在朝鲜战场上遭到了决定性的失败。今天美帝的侵略计划完全破产了，他的最后一着棋就是在欧洲武装西德，在亚洲武装日本。武装西德已遭到全欧洲人民的反对，即将破产；武装日本也一样会失败！现在美帝正在作最后挣扎，我们要加倍警惕，加倍努力，以便彻底击败美帝国主义。”参加座谈会的工人们决定向其他工人和家属进行宣传，揭露美帝单独对日媾和的阴谋，并表示进一步开展爱国主义生产竞赛。电车修造厂劳动模范卢运泰说：“日寇统治北京时，工人们受的苦真说不清。今天美帝重新武装日本，站起来了的中国人民决不允许它！”中国电信工会北京区委员会发表声明称：中国人民决不允许过去的受日寇蹂躏的日子重新返回。我们要求缔结全面的公正的对日和约，结束美帝在日本的独裁统治。
    首都专科以上的学校虽正举行考试，学生们仍密切注意美帝企图单独对日媾和的阴谋，并对此进行了讨论。学生们一致认为：美帝国主义重新武装日本的阴谋，是对亚洲和世界和平的直接威胁。北京大学学生会主席程贤策说：“美帝在朝鲜遭到失败后，慌慌忙忙地想单独对日媾和，这充分表现了美帝的虚弱和愚蠢。我们坚信：中国人民、日本人民、亚洲人民和全世界人民一定能击败美帝国主义这种无耻的阴谋。”北京师范大学的学生们在墙报、黑板报上揭露了美帝这一阴谋。他们一致拥护周外长去年十二月四日关于对日和约的声明。北京铁道学院的学生们学习了本报二十八日的社论，并展开了讨论。他们认为美帝虽然在朝鲜战场上失败了，但仍要继续其侵略政策，重新武装日本就是明证。清华大学物理系四年级的时事讨论会上，同学们一致认为应该在全国展开一个反对美帝片面对日媾和的运动。辅仁大学学生会主席徐炳鑫说：“经过八年艰苦抗日战争而获得胜利的中国人民，坚决反对美帝对日单独媾和，美帝武装日本的阴谋一定会失败！”北京市立第三中学工会在致本报函中，对杜勒斯到达日本，策动单独对日媾和的阴谋，表示了无比愤怒。
