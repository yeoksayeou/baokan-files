Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 13th—The patriotic movement of Chinese Christians is unfolding widely throughout the country. The Christian Reform Movement, initiated by Wu Yaozong and others last July, has penetrated churches across the country. As of early January this year, the number of Christians nationwide who have signed the Reform Declaration has reached 88,596. The Local Church, a single group, mobilized 32,782 believers from 472 churches to sign. Christian associations in various provinces of North China, as well as Guizhou, Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan, Jiangxi, and Yunnan, the Henan-Hubei General Association of the Chinese Lutheran Church, the Jesus Family in Shandong and Gansu, and Christian groups in Hangzhou, Wenzhou, Liuzhou, Taiyuan, Jinan, and other places have all organized large numbers of believers to sign. During the Reform Declaration signing movement, many Christians profoundly exposed the plot of American imperialism to use religion as a tool to invade China and unanimously expressed: resolutely severing ties with imperialism and realizing the Three-Self Patriotic Movement of self-government, self-support, and self-propagation. This movement has been echoed by many Catholics. Catholics in Chongqing, Nanchang, Gui Sui, and other places have successively issued "Self-Reliance Reform Movement Declarations," expressing, like Christians, their intention to sever ties with imperialism and establish new churches.

On the basis of the reform movement, Christian groups in many regions have actively participated in the Chinese people's movement to resist America, aid Korea, and protect our homes. Church groups in Shanghai, Nanjing, Beijing, Jiujiang, Guangzhou, Changsha, Taiyuan, Hangzhou, Chengdu, Lanzhou, and other places have all issued declarations, refuting Austin's shameless lies, or held parades and demonstrations for patriotic action, opposing American imperialist aggression. Churches in many areas have also formulated patriotic covenants for believers and launched current affairs studies. The "Donate First Aid Kits for the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army" movement initiated by the Shanghai Christian Patriotic Action Conference has now collected 4,000 kits; many believers have saved the money they would have spent on Christmas to donate as a substitute for first aid kits. Churches and hospitals in Shanghai, Jinan, and other cities also have many Christians voluntarily signing up to join the aid-Korea medical team.

The decision of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council on handling cultural, educational, relief organizations, and religious groups accepting American subsidies has been warmly supported by Christians. Leading figures of Christian groups in Shanghai, Jinan, Tianjin, Hangzhou, Guangzhou, Sichuan, and other places have issued declarations and opinions. In the declaration jointly issued on January 3 by twenty-six responsible persons from national and local Christian groups in Shanghai, it was unanimously believed that the Government Administration Council's decision will powerfully promote the completion of the Chinese Christian reform task. Currently, the responsible persons of the church groups in Shanghai who jointly issued the declaration are further specifically studying how to implement the Government Administration Council's decision.

　　基督教爱国运动在全国广泛展开
    革新宣言签名者已近九万
    天津南昌天主教徒发表革新宣言
    【新华社上海十三日电】中国基督教徒的爱国运动，在全国各地广泛展开。去年七月由吴耀宗等发起的基督教革新运动，已深入全国各地教会。到今年一月上旬止，全国基督教徒在革新宣言上签名者，达八万八千五百九十六人。仅全国基督徒聚会处一个团体，即发动了四百七十二个教会的三万二千七百八十二个教徒进行签名。华北各省和贵州、湖南、湖北、四川、江西、云南等地的基督教联合会，基督教中华信义会豫鄂总会，山东、甘肃的耶稣家庭，及杭州、温州、柳州、太原、济南等地基督教团体，都有组织地发动了大批教徒签名。在革新宣言签名运动中，许多基督教徒深刻地揭露了美帝国主义企图利用宗教作为侵略中国的工具的阴谋，一致表示：坚决割断与帝国主义的联系，实现自治、自养、自传的三自运动。这一运动得到了许多天主教人士的响应。重庆、南昌、归绥等地天主教人士，都先后发表了“自立革新运动宣言”，与基督教一样，表示要割断与帝国主义的关系，建立新的教会。
    在革新运动的基础上，许多地区的基督教团体，都积极地参加了中国人民抗美援朝爱国运动。上海、南京、北京、九江、广州、长沙、太原、杭州、成都、兰州等地教会团体，都曾发表了宣言，驳斥奥斯汀的无耻谰言，或举行游行示威爱国行动大会，反对美帝国主义侵略。许多地区的教会，并拟定了教徒的爱国公约，展开了时事学习。上海基督教爱国行动大会所发起的为中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军捐献救护袋运动，现已捐集了四千只；不少教徒都把过圣诞节的钱节省下来，捐作救护袋的代金。上海、济南等城市教会、医院，并有许多基督教徒自愿报名参加援朝医疗队。
    中央人民政府政务院关于处理接受美国津贴的文化教育救济机关及宗教团体的方针的决定公布后，受到基督教人士的热烈拥护。上海、济南、天津、杭州、广州、四川等地基督教团体的领袖人物，都发表了宣言和意见。一月三日上海全国性及地方性的基督教团体二十六位负责人士联名发表的宣言中，一致认为：政务院的这一决定，将有力地促进中国基督教革新任务的完成。现在，上海联名发表宣言的各教会团体负责人士，正在进一步具体研究执行政务院决定的办法。
