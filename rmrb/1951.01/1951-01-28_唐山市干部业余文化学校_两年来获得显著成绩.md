　　Tangshan Cadre Spare-Time Cultural School
　　Significant Achievements in the Past Two Years
　　[This newspaper dispatch] Tangshan Cadre Spare-Time Cultural School has made significant achievements in the past two years. The school was established in April of the year before last, with only 672 students at the time. At the end of the first term in September, the school proposed a long-term study policy and formulated a five-year education plan. The number of students increased to more than 2,200. At the end of the second term last April, the cadres participating in the study generally felt that they had gained a lot, so the number of students increased again to more than 2,500. Currently, there are 97 classes in the city (36 classes in junior elementary school, 41 classes in senior elementary school, and 20 classes in junior high school), with more than 4,100 students. There are 62 full-time faculty members and 76 part-time teachers.
　　In the past year, the school has consistently maintained six classes per week, two hours each time (covering two subjects), and some agencies have stipulated one to two hours of review time. Regardless of the season, classes are divided into morning and evening sessions. The average attendance rate is over 80%, with only 15% absent due to official business and about 5% absent without leave. A total of 16 classes, 401 students, have graduated from the entire junior elementary school curriculum; 5 classes, 160 students, have graduated from the entire senior elementary school curriculum. Graduates have been issued graduation certificates and have been promoted to senior elementary school or junior high school respectively.
　　How has the school been consolidated and developed? First, it is due to the attention and leadership of the Tangshan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. On the one hand, it designated specific personnel to be responsible, and on the other hand, it established full-time teachers and prepared certain funds. Within the Party, it called on Party members to take the lead in learning and stipulated study appraisal and other systems to ensure learning.
　　Secondly, thanks to the teachers' study of politics, transformation of ideology, and development of their initiative under the leadership of the Party. In the past year, they have made many innovations in attracting students to school and improving teaching methods. At the beginning, the student absenteeism rate was as high as 50%, and the situation of not handing in homework was even more common. The teachers adopted the method of close contact between the school and the agencies, and regularly informed the relevant agencies of the students' attendance, homework, and academic performance, so that the administration could supervise and check the learning; the agencies would tell the school about the students' opinions on learning at any time, so that the school could improve teaching in a timely manner. When the student attendance rate decreased and homework was not handed in, a "competing for red flags" learning competition was launched among the students, ensuring punctual attendance and submission of homework, greatly reducing or even eliminating phenomena such as absenteeism, truancy, lateness, and failure to submit homework.
　　Thirdly, the responsible comrades of various agencies attach importance to the cultural learning of cadres. On the one hand, they adjusted work to ensure study time; on the other hand, they supervised and inspected, and strengthened the leadership of learning.

　　唐山市干部业余文化学校
    两年来获得显著成绩
    【本报讯】唐山市干部业余文化学校，两年来已有显著成绩。该校系于前年四月开办，当时仅有学员六百七十二人。九月第一期结束，学校即提出长期学习的方针，并制订了五年教育计划。学员增至二千二百余人。去年四月第二期结束时，参加学习干部，普遍感到收获大，因而学习人数又增至二千五百余人。现全市共设立九十七个班（初小三十六班、高小四十一班、初中二十班），学员达四千一百余人。专任教职员六十二人，兼任教员七十六人。
    近一年来，该校经常保持每星期上课六次，每次二小时（上两门课），一部分机关并规定有一至两小时的复习时间。不分季节，均分早晚两班上课。出席人数，平均百分之八十以上，因公事请假缺席者仅百分之十五，旷课者约百分之五。初小全部课程毕业者共十六班，四百零一人；高小全部课程毕业者共五班，一百六十人。毕业学生均已发给毕业证书，并已分别升入高小或初中。
    该校是怎样巩固与发展的呢？首先是中共唐山市委的重视与领导。一方面指定专人负责，另一方面设专任教员，筹备一定经费。在党内则号召党员带头学习，并规定学习鉴定等制度，以保证学习。
    其次，由于教员们在党领导下，学习政治，改造思想，发挥了积极性。一年来他们在争取学员到校、改进教学方法方面有许多创造。开始时，学员缺席率竟达百分之五十，不交作业的情况更是普遍。教员们即采取学校与机关密切联系的方法，定期将学员出席情况、作业情况以及学习成绩通知有关机关，由行政上督促、检查学习；机关则将学员对学习的意见随时告诉校方，使学校能及时改进教学。在学员出席率降低、不交作业的情况下，曾发动学员展开“争红旗”学习竞赛运动，保证了按时出席、交作业，使缺席、旷课、迟到、不交作业等现象大大减少，甚至消灭。
    再次，各机关负责同志，重视干部文化学习。一方面调整工作，保证学习时间；另一方面则督促检查，加强对学习的领导。
