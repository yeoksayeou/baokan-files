[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] Severely Punish the Unrepentant Leaders of Reactionary Secret Societies. Six counter-revolutionary leaders, including Liu Xiangting, Zhang Honghai, Liu Xiyuan, Mu Zhaozeng, Hu Chunlin, leaders of the I-Kuan-Tao and Li Maowu, head of the Nine Palace Tao were executed by firing squad in Beijing. After the liberation of Beijing, these six criminals engaged in counter-revolutionary activities through reactionary secret societies, spread rumors, undermined laws, endangered the people, and even plotted armed rebellion to subvert the government. After they were arrested by the Public Security Bureau, the people successively made accusations and denunciations. After review by the Beijing Municipal People's Procuratorate, their crimes were found to be evident, and they were sentenced to capital punishment by public prosecution. The Military Control Commission Military Court of Beijing Municipality sentenced the above criminals to death on the 17th of this month, and immediately escorted them to the scene of the crime and executed them by firing squad.

	Liu Xiangting, originally named Liu Fenglin, was 60 years old, from Jingxian County, Hebei Province. He was a Taoist master and lecturer of the I-Kuan-Tao. He came from a military gangster background and was a bully in Tianqiao, nicknamed "North Tyrant." He served as a company commander and adjutant in warlord troops. During the Japanese puppet regime, he served as the president of the Tianqiao Puppet Autonomous Association, the honorary section chief of the Puppet Beijing-Hankou Railway Protection Command, and the inspector of the Puppet Beijing Military Police Inspection Office. He colluded with local ruffians such as Li Haiting to forcibly occupy the Le Stage, forcing the original owner of the Jixiang Theater (Tianqiao), Wei Yanlaogong, to his death. During the construction of the Jixiang Theater, he forced a carpenter surnamed Li to death through oppression. He also used the power of the Puppet Autonomous Association to seize Di Yuhai's house, forcing Di and his wife Wei to death. While serving as the president of the Puppet Autonomous Association, he often beat vendors and captured laborers for the Japanese invaders. In 1947, he pretended to be "Old Mother" to heal illnesses and swindle money, resulting in the death of Taoist Zhu Shixue. For more than ten years, the criminal used preaching to rape eleven female Taoists.

	After liberation, the criminal continued to use "giving medicine" as a cover, frequently creating rumors, slandering the government, undermining policies, and carrying out various conspiracies.

	Zhang Honghai, 64 years old, from Beijing, was a landlord and ruffian. He served in the puppet army for many years and later became a puppet security chief. He joined the "I-Kuan-Tao" in 1942, set up an altar at home, and acted as the altar master. In 1936, the criminal colluded with special agent Qi Wenbo to force Zhang Honghe away, severely tortured Zhang Honghe's pregnant wife, poured chili water on her until she died, and led twelve armed agents to detain the people of Daodi Village, taking Zhang Hongchuan and Lu Yuchuan to the puppet police station and beating them unconscious four or five times, and forced Lu's wife to death with a gun. In the same year, he colluded with the puppet police to arrest Wang Xiaoliu and Lu Laishun, causing Wang Xiaoliu to die in prison; and while Lu was in prison, he went to Lu's house and raped Lu's wife. He abducted Zhang Changhe's younger sister Er Diaozi and sold her to a brothel, causing Er Diaozi's blind mother to starve to death. In 1942, the criminal colluded with Japanese agent Wang Dejin to shoot and kill our staff members Zhao Yupin and Sun Fuzeng. In 1946, he colluded with the puppet homecoming captain Liu Yubao to kill village deputy Zhang Fanhai and Peng Shitian's father. In 1943, he seized Zhang Ai's land and shot and killed Zhang Changji and Ma Xueyi in prison. In 1947, the criminal tricked a woman from Mentougou, raped her at home, and then sent her to the Northeast to be sold. After liberation, the criminal continued to carry out counter-revolutionary activities and undermine land reform.

	Liu Xiyuan, also known as Liu Jianxun, was 42 years old, from Beijing. He served as the puppet fourth joint guarantor of the northern suburbs, the president of the fourth branch of the Puppet New People's Association, the head of the third neighborhood of the puppet regime, and the director of the Puppet Beiping City Farmers' Association and the director of the cooperative of the puppet 19th District. He joined the "I-Kuan-Tao" in 1945 and became the altar master. In 1947, he joined the Chiang Kai-shek bandit secret service organization. In 1948, the criminal and Wang, the deputy captain of the puppet self-defense team, gathered fifty to sixty secret agents and used violence to stop the student movement at Tsinghua University. In November 1945, bandit troops detained four of our guerrillas. In addition to one person being tortured to death, the remaining three were shot and killed because of the criminal's instigation. When the criminal was the puppet joint guarantor, he often extorted copper and iron for the Japanese invaders and conscripted laborers.

	Mu Zhaozeng, also known as Mu Ruitian, was 55 years old, from Beijing. He was a landlord and tyrant and served as the director of the Dongba "Green Seed Association." He joined the I-Kuan-Tao in 1939. In 1945, the criminal incited the puppet police brigade to surround our guerrillas, kill the squad leader, and arrest the members Han Shirong and others. In 1946, after Li Songshan, a cadre of the Tongxian District, was arrested by the bandit army, the criminal and the puppet joint guarantor jointly submitted an "accusation" accusing Li Songshan of being a member of the Eighth Route Army. Li Songshan was immediately shot and killed by the bandit army. In 1948, the criminal organized the "Anti-Communist Committee," received guns, and carried out armed counter-revolution. After liberation, the criminal continued to carry out sabotage activities, spreading rumors everywhere, undermining land reform, and secretly manipulating the village regime and undermining the policies of the People's Government.

	Hu Chunlin, also known as Hu Maotang, was 42 years old, from Beijing. He joined the "I-Kuan-Tao" in 1941 and served as an altar master and lecturer. For the past ten years, the criminal has continuously used various tricks such as "doing meritorious deeds," "liberating karma," "opening up wasteland," "ferrying great immortals," "settling debts," "establishing Buddhist halls," "sending masters," "offering sacrifices," and "opening classes" to extort countless amounts of property from ignorant Taoists. The criminal gave a large amount of the money he had swindled to Zhang Chengzhong and Zhang Wufu as funds for counter-revolutionary activities. The remainder was used to hoard and speculate for huge profits. After Hu was reported, the masses said at the accusation meeting: "We have become poor from practicing Taoism, but Hu Chunlin has become rich from practicing Taoism." He also treated the deceived Taoists in every possible way. If he was slightly unhappy, he would order his son Hu Yuxiang to beat them at will. Taoist He Wenzhi was so angry that he died a few days after being beaten; when Zhou Ruiliang's mother fell ill, Hu Chunlin prevented the doctor from treating her, telling her to do more "meritorious deeds" and "settle debts," resulting in her death due to delay. After liberation, he continued to lie dormant in accordance with the instructions of the bandit Zhang Wufu. The bandit Zhang Chengzhong organized the leadership core of the outer west group, and Hu Chunlin was one of them. The criminal often used meetings at Huayi Altar, Jingyi Altar, etc., or used the method of visiting three or five people to spread reactionary rumors.

	Li Maowu, also known as Li Fuchang, was 37 years old, from Tancheng, Shandong Province. He came from a gangster background. In 1937, he joined the "Nine Palace Tao" and accepted the instructions of the Taoist bandit leader Li Shutian to specialize in creating rumors and extorting money. From 1949 to June 1950 when he was arrested, Li Maowu extorted 104 taels of gold, 115 gold rings, 1,885 silver dollars, 140 pieces of jewelry and jade, and a large amount of other money and property from the masses. In 1940, they used the name "Peace General Church" in Jinan, Shandong, and under the direction of Japanese invaders "Er Gong Bofu," actively engaged in anti-communist and anti-people activities. In April 1944, they organized the "Big Sword Society" in Tancheng, Shandong, inciting Taoists to openly resist the Eighth Route Army with arms. After Li Shutian's death in 1945, Li Maowu inherited the position of "Living Buddha." In 1947, he was introduced to the secret agent Sun Tongxuan by Liu Peizhong (a Bagua Taoist), a secret agent of the Kuomintang, and joined the secret agent organization "Production Promotion Association," serving as a counselor. Later, he claimed to be the "True Dragon Emperor," creating rumors, inciting backward masses, and seducing women Zhao Bijing, Liu Suyun, Yue Yuexiu, Zou Gaoshi and others. After liberation, Li Maowu and his bandit Wang Yiduo opened the "Keren Family Industrial Cooperative" at No. 2 Xieji衚Tong in this city. In October, they ordered Zhang Yongchen and Wang Ziheng to open "Mingji Grain Store" at No. 15 Sun Park in this city and Waizhong as a base for bandits from all over the country to communicate and carry out anti-communist and anti-people propaganda. In 1950, Li犯召集 convened a meeting of upper-level bandits, announcing that May 5th of that year was "Mingdao," calling on bandits to step up their activities, actively expand their organization, and prepare for armed rebellion.
