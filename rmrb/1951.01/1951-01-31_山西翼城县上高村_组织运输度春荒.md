　　Shanggao Village, Yicheng County, Shanxi Province
    Organizes Transportation to Overcome the Spring Famine
    In the winter transportation efforts, the Shanggao Village transportation team in Yicheng County, Shanxi Province, earned a total of 11,598,000 yuan in one and a half months. Farmers exchanged five old and weak livestock, bought one additional head of livestock; bought and repaired six carts, and purchased more than a hundred *shi* of grain and more than 1,500 *jin* of salt. This has basically solved some of the difficulties faced by transportation households in spring production next year and in their current lives.
    The Shanggao Village transportation team was organized on a voluntary basis and has a three-year foundation. There are a total of forty-one carts in the village, of which thirty-five participated in the transportation team. Their organization is very simple. Under the leadership of several activists, whenever they encounter problems, they study and solve them democratically with everyone. Therefore, the people participating in the transportation are very closely united. Activists Gao Chaohe, Wang Yanwen, and Wang Zhanying often automatically establish relationships with various state-owned or private stores to find goods for transportation. In addition to organizing the masses in their own village to transport goods, they sometimes find people from Shiqiao Village and Shoucheng Village to transport goods together when there are a lot of goods. Every time they transport cotton to Houma, they buy salt on their way back. The autumn harvest in the village was not good this year, but the spring famine problem has been solved for the households participating in the transportation.

　　山西翼城县上高村
    组织运输度春荒
    山西翼城县上高村运输组在冬季运输中，一个半月来共赚一千一百五十九万八千元。农民调换了老弱牲口五头，增买牲口一头；新买和修理了车六辆，购买粮食百余石，及食盐一千五百多斤。基本上解决了运输户在明年春季生产上和当前生活上的一些困难。
    上高村运输组是在自愿的原则下组织起来的，已有了三年的基础。全村共有四十一辆车，其中三十五辆参加了运输组。他们的组织很简单，在几个积极分子带头领导下，每逢遇到问题，就通过民主方式和大家研究解决，所以参加运输的人团结得很紧密。积极分子高朝河、王延文、王占营经常自动与各国营或私营商店打通关系找货物运输。他们除组织本村群众运输外，有时货多，还到石桥村寿城村找人合伙去拉货。每次他们往侯马拉送棉花，回来时就买上食盐。该村今年秋收是不好的，但这次参加运输的户，春荒问题是解决了。
