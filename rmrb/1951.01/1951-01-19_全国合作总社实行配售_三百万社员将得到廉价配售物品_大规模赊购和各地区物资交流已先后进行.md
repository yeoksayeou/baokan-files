　　National Cooperative Federation Implements Rationing
    Three Million Members to Receive Low-Priced Rationed Goods
    Large-Scale Credit Purchases and Inter-Regional Material Exchanges Have Been Carried Out Successively
    [Reported by this newspaper] The decision to implement organized and planned quantitative rationing for three million cooperative members, along with large-scale credit purchase work and inter-regional material exchange methods, has been made at the Trade Procurement Conference held by the National Cooperative Federation. The Trade Procurement Conference convened by the National Cooperative Federation opened on December 17, 1950, and concluded on the 28th. A total of 115 representatives from the cooperative federations of various provinces and cities attended. The conference first discussed how cooperatives should eliminate free market transactions and concentrate all their efforts on serving members in the operation of consumer businesses, based on the report by Deputy Director Cheng Zihua. At the same time, it discussed and arranged quantitative rationing and credit purchase work for the first quarter of 1951, and invited Soviet experts to give special reports on cooperative procurement and trade operations.

    The conference unanimously supported the implementation of quantitative rationing, considering it one of the important measures to implement the principle of "grassroots cooperatives serving members, and higher-level cooperatives serving lower-level cooperatives." It will enable members to regularly, equitably, and reliably obtain a certain amount of low-priced necessities, thereby attracting the broad masses of working people to join cooperatives, strengthening and consolidating the mass base of cooperatives, and promoting the normalization of cooperatives and strengthening the planning of cooperative consumer businesses. Therefore, the conference unanimously agreed to vigorously carry out rationing operations within the scope of national cooperatives in 1951, but in order to gain experience and prepare conditions, it was decided to focus on pilot projects in the first quarter. In the first quarter, 3.1 million cooperative members will be able to enjoy the rationing of goods (1.19 million in 40 cities and more than 1.9 million in rural areas). In order to ensure the smooth implementation of the rationing business, the conference discussed and approved the following documents: (1) Decision of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives on the Implementation of Rationing, (2) Rationing Measures for the First Quarter of 1951, (3) Joint Decision of the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government and the All-China Federation of Cooperatives on the Source and Preferential Rates of Rationed Materials for Cooperatives, (4) Rationing Plan for the First Quarter of 1951.

    Due to the different living habits and purchasing power of the masses in urban and rural areas, in the South, North, Northeast, and Northwest, the types and quantities of rationed goods should also be different. For example, urban cooperative members have higher purchasing power and need more types of daily necessities, and the quantity of preferential rationing they enjoy is more than double that of farmers. Farmers in the Northeast have a higher degree of commodity production and higher purchasing power, and the types and quantities of rations are also higher than those of cooperative members within the customs. Based on the consumption situation in various regions, the conference formulated the rationing volume of major consumer goods in each province and city under the principle of "generally sufficient, slightly insufficient."

    Under the current specific circumstances, rationing prices cannot be uniformly stipulated. Therefore, the following methods were adopted: (1) The state-owned specialized companies in various regions will give discounts on the wholesale prices of rationed goods for the day, which will be used as the purchase price for cooperatives; (2) The standards for transportation costs, losses, and retail expenses of grassroots cooperatives shall be studied and stipulated by the county (city) federations based on local conditions, and approved by the provincial federations as retail cost prices. The standards for transportation costs, losses, and wholesale expenses of county (city) federations to lower-level cooperatives shall be studied and stipulated by the provincial federations, and approved by the greater administrative regions and the National Federation as wholesale cost prices; (3) The retail net profit of grassroots cooperatives is stipulated by the National Federation to be 1%, and the wholesale net profit of county, city, and above federations is 0.5%. The purchase price plus expenses and net profit is the rationing price for members. According to this algorithm, some commodities can be lower than the market price by more than 30%, and at least about 10% lower.

    Ensuring the regular supply and preferential treatment of rationed goods is one of the most concerning issues for various regions. Some are afraid that "the thunder is loud, but the rain is light." Vice Minister of Trade Yao Yilin stated in his report that state-owned trade agencies are determined to vigorously support the rationing business of cooperatives, and the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government and the All-China Federation of Cooperatives made a joint decision: (1) Instructing each specialized company to give priority to meeting the rationing needs of cooperatives with the goods they control; (2) Rationed goods will be given preferential treatment according to the company's wholesale price for the day in the local area; (3) The quality of rationed goods shall be based on the consumer habits of the local masses and the company's listed goods; (4) Cooperatives shall pay in cash for rationed goods. And instructed each specialized company and cooperative to jointly abide by the decision and resolutely implement it, otherwise they will be criticized, notified, and even subject to administrative punishment.

    The implementation of a systematic and planned rationing system in our country is an arduous mass work and organizational work. Therefore, the conference instructed cooperative workers at all levels to make the proper handling of rationing work one of the main tasks in 1951.

    In order to implement the business policy of wholeheartedly serving members, this conference insisted on canceling retail transactions conducted by cooperatives in the free market. Only in this way can non-members be attracted to join cooperatives, so as to achieve the goal of organizing the working people and serving the working people in an organized and planned manner. The conference also resolved the following issues: (1) In the new areas, when building societies, if there are higher-level societies but no lower-level societies, or if there are grassroots societies but no members, we should first investigate what the masses buy and sell, and then take the goods to the countryside to publicize, while absorbing members and buying and selling goods. If we absorb a few members, we will serve those few members, and we cannot use the pretext of building a society to expand transactions with non-members. (2) Currently, the retail departments of general federations at all levels are actually ordinary retail stores. Various places have proposed that if the retail departments are canceled, the turnover will be reduced and expenses cannot be maintained; in fact, if the retail departments are changed to wholesale departments, concentrating all efforts on wholesale business to lower-level societies, the turnover will inevitably increase rapidly after a short-term reduction, and the difficulty of expenses will no longer be a problem after a period of time.

    Regarding credit purchase work, the conference has made further arrangements according to the original plan. Four agreements and nine contracts were signed for the exchange of materials between various regions, as well as between the National Federation and various regions, including 65,000 tons of grain, 500,000 bolts of various foreign cloths, 15 million square feet of native cloth, and 1.05 million catties of cotton. There are also exchange contracts for 28 kinds of commodities such as towels, socks, brown sugar, and iron pots. The total value is more than 159 billion yuan. In addition, the Northeast Federation signed material exchange agreements with the National Federation and the East China Federation, with a total value of 401.2 billion yuan.

　　全国合作总社实行配售
    三百万社员将得到廉价配售物品
    大规模赊购和各地区物资交流已先后进行
    【本报讯】有组织有计划地对三百万合作社社员定量配售，与大规模的赊购工作，以及各地区的物资交换办法，已在全国合作总社召开的贸易采购会议上作出决定。全国合作总社召开的贸易采购会议于一九五○年十二月十七日开幕，至二十八日结束。到各省市合作总社代表共计一百一十五人。会议首先根据程子华副主任的报告，讨论了合作社在经营消费业务方面，如何取消合作社进行自由市场交易及集中全力为社员服务的业务方针，同时讨论与布置了一九五一年第一季度定量配售及赊购工作，并请苏联专家作了合作社的采购业务与贸易业务的专题报告。
    会议一致拥护实行定量配售，认为这是贯彻“基层合作社为社员服务，上级社为下级社服务”的重要措施之一。它将使社员经常地、平均地、有保证地得到一定数量的廉价必需品的供应，从而吸引广大劳动人民加入合作社，壮大与巩固合作社的群众基础，并可促使合作社走上正轨，加强合作社消费业务的计划性。因此会议一致同意于一九五一年在全国合作社范围内大力开展配售业务，但为吸取经验、准备条件，决定在第一季开始重点试办。第一季配售的物品，有三百一十万社员得以享受（四十个城市一百一十九万余，农村一百九十万）。为保证配售业务的顺利进行，会议讨论并通过了下列文件：（一）全国合作社联合总社关于实行配售的决定，（二）一九五一年第一季配售办法，（三）中央人民政府贸易部、中华全国合作社联合总社关于合作社配售物资来源及优待率的联合决定，（四）一九五一年第一季配售计划。
    由于城市、乡村，南方、北方、东北、西北等地群众的生活习惯和购买力的不同，因而配售品的种类及定量，亦应有所不同。如城市社员购买力较高，生活需要品类较多，享受配售优待的数量，超过农民一倍多。东北农民生产商品化的程度大，购买力较高，配售种类及定量，亦较高于关内社员。会议根据各地消费情况，在“大体够，稍有不足”的原则下，制订了各省各市主要消费品的配售量。
    配售价格在目前具体情况下，尚不能统一规定，因此采取了下列办法：（一）配售商品由各地国家专业公司按当日批发牌价予以折扣后，作为合作社进货价格；（二）基层合作社的运费、损耗及零售开支标准，由县（市）总社根据当地情况研究规定，经省总社批准后作为零售成本价格，县（市）总社向下级社批发的运费、损耗及批发开支等标准，由省总社研究规定，经大行政区及全国总社批准作为批发成本价格；（三）基层社的零售纯益，由全国总社规定为百分之一，县、市以上总社批发纯益为千分之五，进货价格加开支纯益，就是向社员的配售价格，根据这一算法，有的商品可低于市价百分之三十以上，最少亦低百分之十左右。
    关于保证配售商品的经常供应及优待，是各地最关心的问题之一，有的怕“雷声大，雨点小”。贸易部姚依林副部长在报告中，表示国营贸易机关决大力支持合作社的配售业务，并由中央人民政府贸易部与全国合作总社作了联合决定：（一）责成各专业公司掌握的商品，尽先满足合作社配售需要；（二）配售商品按当地当日公司批发牌价进行优待；（三）配售商品质量，以适宜于当地群众消费习惯及公司挂牌商品为准；（四）合作社领取配售品，一律现款交易。并责成各专业公司及合作社共同遵照决定坚决执行，否则将予批评、通报直到受行政处分。
    在我国实行有系统有计划的配售制度，是一个艰巨的群众工作和组织工作，因此会议又责成各级合作社工作者，应把办好配售工作作为一九五一年主要任务之一。
    这次会议为了贯彻全力为社员服务的业务方针，坚持取消合作社进行自由市场零售交易。因为只有如此，才能吸引非社员加入合作社，以便达到组织劳动人民的目的，有组织有计划地为劳动人民服务。会议并解决了下列问题：（一）新区在开始建社时，在有上级社无下级社，有基层社无社员的情况下，应首先调查群众买进与卖出的东西，然后带货下乡宣传，一面吸收社员，一面买卖货物，吸收几个社员，就为了几个社员服务，不能借口建社，而扩大对非社员交易。（二）目前各级总社门市部，实际就是普通的零售商店。各地提出如取消门市部，营业额因而减少，不能维持开支；其实，若将门市部改批发部，集中全力对下级社进行批发业务，营业额经过短时的减少必然会迅速地增加起来，开支的困难，经过一个时期也就会不成问题。
    关于赊购工作，会议已按原计划进一步布置。各地区间的物资交换，以及全国总社与各地区的物资交换，订立了协议四件，合同九件，其中粮食类占六万五千吨，各种洋布五十万匹，土布一千五百万方尺，棉花一百零五万斤。其他尚有毛巾、袜子、红糖、铁锅等二十八种商品的交换合同。合计总值为一千五百九十余亿元。此外，东北总社与全国总社及华东总社订立了物资交换协议，总值为四千零十二亿元。
