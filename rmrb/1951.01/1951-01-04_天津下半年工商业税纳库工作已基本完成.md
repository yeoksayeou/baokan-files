Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 29th. The work of paying industrial and commercial taxes in Tianjin for the second half of 1950 has been basically completed. As of the 26th, the number of taxpayers has reached more than 94% of the total number of households. Due to the general improvement in Tianjin's industrial and commercial business in the second half of the year, the tax revenue increased by more than 36% compared with the first half of the year.

At the same time, the efficiency of this industrial and commercial tax collection has also been unprecedentedly improved, taking only one month from the start of the arrangement to the completion of the tax payment. This shows that in the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea and defend our homes and country, the patriotic enthusiasm of the industrial and commercial circles has been greatly enhanced.

　　天津下半年工商业税纳库工作已基本完成
    【新华社天津十二月二十九日电】天津市一九五○年下半年度工商业税的纳库工作已告基本完成。截至二十六日止，纳库户数已达总户数的百分之九十四以上。由于下半年津市工商业营业普遍好转，入库税款较上半年增加百分之三十六强。
    同时这次工商业税的征收效率也空前提高，自开始布置到完成入库为时仅一个月。这说明在抗美援朝保家卫国运动当中，工商界的爱国热情业已大大提高。
