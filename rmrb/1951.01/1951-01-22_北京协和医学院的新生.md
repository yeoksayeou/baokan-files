　　New Students at Peking Union Medical College
　　Ye Qun
　　The private Peking Union Medical College, which had been subsidized by the United States, was officially taken over by our Central People's Government Ministry of Health on January 20.
　　That morning, when the faculty, students, and staff of the college heard the news that the college would be taken over in the afternoon, they were all very happy and excited. The workers happily said, "Now we are completely liberated!" Professor Zhang Xijun, director of the Department of Physiology of the college, was so excited that he could not sleep the night before after learning the news. The next day, when reporters met him in his studio, he said excitedly: "After I knew this, I was really filled with gratitude and shame. When American imperialism insulted us, our government gave us practical help. From now on, we must further unite and serve the people, and eliminate the ideological influence left by the American imperialists." This 51-year-old professor was so excited when he spoke on behalf of all the staff at the reception meeting! Dean Li Zong'en said: "The psychological contradictions I have had for several years have been resolved." Student representative Qu Jingxian said: "I feel excited, happy, and proud. I will definitely study hard in the future." This kind of emotion is understandable.
　　Peking Union Medical College was established in 1906. In 1915, it was taken over by the Rockefeller Foundation's China Medical Board, which belonged to the American "Oil King" Rockefeller. Rockefeller's agents further promoted "America First" here and instilled the idea of "science transcends politics" into students, with the aim of making students ignore the suffering of old China and the heroic struggle of the Chinese people against imperialism and feudalism.
　　After liberation, the political consciousness of the faculty, students, and staff of the college was generally improved. Especially in the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, everyone more clearly recognized the aggressive face of American imperialists and set off an unprecedented patriotic upsurge in Peking Union Medical College. People who didn't care much about politics before now care about politics, and people who didn't read newspapers much in the past are now very concerned about political current affairs news in the newspapers. On the day of the demonstration against shameless slander, everyone fully expressed their patriotic and anti-imperialist enthusiasm.
　　In the comfort movement, all departments enthusiastically sewed comfort bags, filled with various items suitable for the needs of the soldiers, and attached letters and poems full of enthusiasm. Some people also ingeniously clipped letters in comfort bags or vest pockets to give the soldiers unexpected joy. This shows how deeply they love the Chinese People's Volunteers!
　　"We will run Peking Union Medical College ten times or a hundred times better than when we accepted American subsidies!"
　　This is the determination and confidence shown by Peking Union Medical College in response to the call of Qian Junrui, Vice Minister of Education of the Central People's Government! Peking Union Medical College is reborn, and the people of the whole country have great expectations for it.

　　北京协和医学院的新生
    叶群
    接受美国津贴的私立北京协和医学院于一月二十日由我中央人民政府卫生部正式接收了。
    那天上午，该院师生员工们听到了下午接收该院的消息时，都非常愉快和兴奋。工友们高兴地说：“这下我们彻底解放了！”该院生理科主任张锡钧教授，在前一天晚上知道这消息后，兴奋得睡不着觉。第二天记者在他的工作室会见他时，他激动地说：“我知道这事后，真是感愧交集。当美帝国主义侮辱我们的时候，我们的政府就给我们实际的援助。从今以后，我们同人一定要更进一步地团结起来为人民服务，肃清美帝残留下来的思想影响。”这位五十一岁的老教授，在接收大会上代表全院员工讲话时，一直是那样的昂奋！李宗恩院长说：我几年来心理上的矛盾解除了。学生代表瞿敬贤说：我感到兴奋、愉快、骄傲，今后一定努力学习。这种情绪是可以理解的。
    协和医学院是在一九○六年成立的。一九一五年改由美国“煤油大王”罗克斐勒的罗氏驻华医社接办。罗氏的代理人就在这里进一步宣传“美国第一”主义，向学生灌输“科学超政治”的思想，其目的是要学生们无视旧中国的苦难和中国人民反帝反封建的英勇斗争。
    解放以后，该院师生员工的政治觉悟普遍提高。特别是在抗美援朝运动中，大家更清楚地认识了美帝国主义者的侵略面目，掀起了协和空前未有的爱国主义的热潮。原来不大关心政治的人关心政治了，过去不大看报纸的人，现在都非常注意报上的政治时事消息了。在反对无耻诽谤的示威游行的那一天，大家充分表现了爱国反帝的热情。
    在慰劳运动中，各部门都热情地缝制慰劳袋，里面装着各种适合战士们需要的物件，附着充满热情的信和诗。有些人还别出心裁地把信夹在慰劳袋里或背心袋子里，要给战士们出乎意外的高兴。这说明了他们对于祖国人民志愿军的热爱是何等深切！
    “我们要把协和办得比接受美国津贴时好十倍、百倍！”
    这是协和同人在响应中央人民政府教育部钱副部长的号召时所表现的决心和信心！协和医学院新生了，全国人民对它有很大的期望。
