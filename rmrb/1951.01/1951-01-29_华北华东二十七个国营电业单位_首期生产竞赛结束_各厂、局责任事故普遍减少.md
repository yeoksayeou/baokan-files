As a result of the competition, accidents in power plants decreased by an average of 48.9% compared to the third quarter of last year, and accidents in electricity bureaus decreased by an average of 61.51% compared to the third quarter of last year. Fatal accidents have been completely eliminated in all factories and bureaus. During the competition, Tangshan Power Plant set a new national record by consuming only 0.561 kilograms of coal per kilowatt-hour generated.

The aforementioned competition was launched on November 15th last year at the call of the National Committee of the Electricity Workers' Union. The participating factories and bureaus were divided into three groups for the competition. Each group aimed to eliminate responsibility accidents and ensure safe power generation or supply. After the first phase of the competition, the judging committee, composed of the Director of the Electricity Administration Bureau of the Central Fuel Industry Department, the Minister of the Production Department of the National Committee of the Electricity Workers' Union, and representatives of the participating units, summarized and judged the results. As a result, the power plants that won the excellence award were Tianjin No. 2 Plant, Taiyuan No. 1 Plant, Taiyuan No. 3 Plant, Qinhuangdao Plant, and Weishui Plant in the first group; Zibo Plant in the second group; and Southern Jiangsu No. 1 Plant in the third group. The electricity bureaus that won the excellence award were Tangshan Bureau, Nanjing Bureau, and Shijiazhuang Bureau. According to the provisions of the competition contract, the ten winning units were awarded an excellence prize banner. The Electricity Administration Bureau also gave a considerable amount of bonuses to Tianjin No. 2 Plant, Taiyuan No. 1 Plant, Taiyuan No. 3 Plant, Qinhuangdao Plant, and Weishui Plant, which completely eliminated accidents, according to the reward methods stipulated by the bureau.

During this competition, the trade unions of various factories and bureaus were able to actively respond to the call of the National Committee of the Electricity Workers' Union, provide in-depth leadership, and ensure the smooth progress of the competition. At the beginning of the competition, the trade union of Tianjin No. 2 Plant mobilized employees to discuss the conditions of the inter-factory competition, helped production teams formulate competition guarantee conditions, and at the same time, cooperated with the factory administration to further strengthen the responsibility system and shift handover system in each workshop, and mobilized workers to sign contact contracts.

Three groups have now started the second phase of the patriotic production competition, and the rest will also start on February 1st. The content of the second phase of the competition is mainly to consolidate the achievements of the first phase, continue to eliminate accidents, and ensure safe power supply or generation.

    首期生产竞赛结束
    各厂、局责任事故普遍减少
    【新华社二十六日讯】华北、华东二十七个国营电业单位的爱国主义生产竞赛第一期已如期在去年十二月底结束。天津二厂、唐山局等十个单位荣获优胜。竞赛结果，各发电厂的事故平均比去年第三季减少了百分之四十八点九，各电业局的事故平均比去年第三季减少百分之六十一点五一。人身死亡事故已在各厂、局内完全消灭。竞赛中更出现了唐山发电厂发一度电只耗煤零点五六一公斤的全国新纪录。
    上述竞赛是在电业工会全国委员会的号召之下，于去年十一月十五日开始的。参加的厂、局各分三组竞赛。各组都以消灭责任事故，保证安全发电或供电为竞赛目标。第一期竞赛结束后，由中央燃料工业部电业管理总局局长、电业工会全国委员会生产部部长及参加单位的代表组成的评判委员会总结评判。结果荣获优胜的发电厂，在第一组是天津二厂、太原一厂、太原三厂、秦皇岛厂、微水厂，在第二组是淄博厂，在第三组是苏南一厂；电业局获得优胜的是唐山局、南京局和石家庄局。按照竞赛合同的规定，十个优胜单位均荣获优胜奖旗一面。电业总局又根据该局所规定的奖励办法，对完全消灭事故的天津二厂、太原一厂、太原三厂、秦皇岛厂和微水厂，给予相当数量的奖金。
    此次竞赛中，各厂、局工会多能积极响应电业工会全国委员会的号召，深入领导，保证竞赛的顺利进行。天津二厂工会在竞赛初期，即发动职工讨论厂际竞赛条件，帮助生产小组订立竞赛保证条件，同时配合工厂行政方面，进一步加强了各车间的责任制度和交接班制度，发动工人签订联系合同。
    现在已有三组开始第二期爱国主义生产竞赛，其余也将在二月一日开始。第二期竞赛的内容，主要是巩固第一期竞赛成绩，继续消灭事故，保证安全供电或发电。
