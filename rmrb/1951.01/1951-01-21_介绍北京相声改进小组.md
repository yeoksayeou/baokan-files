　　Introducing the Beijing Crosstalk Improvement Group
    Lao She
    Editor's note: Mr. Lao She has made many valuable efforts in improving crosstalk and other forms of folk art. In this short article, he correctly points out the role of crosstalk in propaganda. He mentions that improving crosstalk must first and foremost avoid vulgar language, which means resolutely removing the low-level tastes and inappropriate metaphors that exist in crosstalk, especially the many words that uglify and insult the working people, so that this mass entertainment can truly become a beneficial spiritual food for the people. This point deserves special attention from folk art workers.

    The 19th of this month marks the anniversary of the founding of the Beijing Crosstalk Improvement Group. In this year, based on this group, Beijing's crosstalk performers have carried out internal unity work and jointly discussed how to improve crosstalk. The improvement of crosstalk roughly takes two methods: negatively, avoiding vulgar language in all performances (such as acting foolishly, joking about parents and wives, ridiculing the working people, etc.); old routines that are too bad are no longer performed. Positively, old routines are adapted, removing the stale and adding new principles; and new routines are created. Some of the new routines are written by literary workers, and some are created by the performers themselves. Generally speaking, the routines created by the performers themselves are better, because they can skillfully use old techniques. The writings of literary people must be revised by performers to be enriched. Making fun is a difficult thing. Literary people have ideas, but how to express these ideas in jokes requires learning from the performers.
    When this group was first established, literary workers and performers were a little skeptical about whether crosstalk could be improved at all. Originally, old crosstalk was only meant to make the audience laugh, but now it had to be changed to cooperate with political tasks and have ideological education. Wouldn't that be quite difficult? However, after several experiments, everyone gradually gained confidence. It turned out that the satire in crosstalk, if used appropriately, is a sharp weapon for propaganda. For example, in the movement to resist America and aid Korea, using crosstalk to ridicule American aggressors could really achieve the effect of despising America and hating America, because crosstalk itself has always been a dishonest thing; its dishonest energy cannot be compared with other forms of folk art. In this way, everyone had confidence, believing that crosstalk could not only exist, but also has a great future. In addition, workers and students also like crosstalk, and even schools have crosstalk groups, so the performers are even happier and work harder.
    Of course, the Crosstalk Improvement Group must continue to work hard. First, it must expand the scope of unity, not only absorbing all the crosstalk performers in Beijing, but also establishing closer ties with the entire folk art circle; second, it must intensify its studies, improve its thinking, and intensify the literacy movement, in order to be able to undertake the task of improving crosstalk.

　　介绍北京相声改进小组
    老舍
    编者按：老舍先生在改进相声及其他曲艺上做了许多可宝贵的努力。他在这篇短文中正确指出了相声在宣传上的作用，其中提到改进相声，首先必须力避口脏，这就是说必须将相声中存在着的低劣趣味和不伦不类的比喻特别是许多丑化与侮辱劳动人民的言语，坚决去掉，使这一群众性的娱乐能够真正成为人民的有益的精神食粮，这一点值得引起曲艺工作者的特别注意。            
    本月十九日是北京相声改进小组成立周年纪念日。在这一年里，以这小组为基础，北京的相声艺人们进行了内部的团结工作，并共同研讨如何改进相声。对相声的改进，大约取两个办法：消极的，不论表演什么都力避口脏（如撒村，用父母妻子开玩笑，挖苦劳动人民等）；太坏的老段子不再演用。积极的，改编老段子，删去陈腐，添加新道理；和创作新段子。新段子的创作，有的由文艺工作者执笔，有的由艺人自创。大致的说，艺人自创的较比好一些，因为他们会巧妙的运用老技巧。文人写的须经艺人修改过才能充实。取笑是件很难的事。文人们有思想，但如何把思想用笑话说出来，就要向艺人们领教了。
    在这小组初一成立的时候，文艺工作者与艺人们都有点怀疑，相声到底能不能改进呢。本来吗，以前的老相声是只供听众哈哈一笑，而今硬要把它改成能配合政治任务，能有思想教育，岂不相当的困难么？可是，经过几次试验以后，大家慢慢的有了自信心，原来相声中的讽刺，假若用合适了，正是一种宣传的利器啊。举个例说，在抗美援朝运动中，用相声挖苦美国侵略者，就真的能收到鄙美仇美的作用，因为相声本身一向是不甚老实的东西；它的不老实的劲儿，不是别种曲艺所能比得上的。这样，大家都有了信心，认为相声不单能存在，而且很有前途。再加上，工人与学生们也喜欢相声，甚至学校里也有了相声小组，艺人们就更高兴更努力了。
    当然，相声改进小组还要继续努力，第一要把团结的范围更扩大一些，不单要吸收所有的在京的相声艺人，还要与全曲艺界发生更密切的联系；第二要加紧学习，提高思想，加紧推动识字运动，以期能担起改进相声的任务。
