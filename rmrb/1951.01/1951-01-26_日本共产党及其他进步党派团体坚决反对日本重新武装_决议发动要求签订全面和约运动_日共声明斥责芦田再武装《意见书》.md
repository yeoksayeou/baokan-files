　　Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 25th: According to a report from the Denstu News Agency in Tokyo: Representatives from the Japanese Communist Party, the Labor-Farmer Party, left-wing Socialist Party organizations, and seventy worker and other democratic groups held a conference in mid-January. The conference resolved to launch a nationwide movement demanding the signing of a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan, and resolutely opposed Japanese rearmament. The participating representatives unanimously believed that "the immediate withdrawal of all occupation forces after the conclusion of a treaty is necessary for Japan's independence and peaceful survival."

　　Another report from the United Press: A mass movement for peace signatures and a comprehensive peace treaty is actively underway in Hyogo Prefecture. In Kobe City, led by workers from "Kawasaki Steel Corporation," other workers, small and medium-sized entrepreneurs, housewives, and others donated comfort bags to the persecuted Korean residents in the area, and also collected peace signatures and comprehensive peace treaty votes. Female members of the city's "Association to Defend Peace" collected peace signatures and comprehensive peace treaty votes in front of a movie theater showing the anti-war film "Rome, Open City." On the first day, they received responses from 306 people in just two hours.

　　Xinhua News Agency, January 24th: According to a United Press report on January 6th: The Japanese Communist Party issued a statement condemning former Japanese Prime Minister Ashida Hitoshi, disgraced by corruption and bribery and president of the Democratic Party (the predecessor of the current National Democratic Party), for advocating the so-called "strengthening of self-defense capabilities" in his "Opinions." In his "Opinions" submitted to MacArthur Headquarters last December, Ashida shamelessly offered advice for a plan to rearm Japan.

　　The Japanese Communist Party's statement stated: Ashida Hitoshi's "Opinions" are not just his personal opinion; they have a vanguard role for the Japanese fascist camp and are a shameless challenge to the Japanese people who demand peace and independence. Under the guise of so-called "autonomous defense," and in the name of "national movements to assist the United Nations," it attempts to revive Japanese militarism and fascism. The statement also pointed out that this "Opinions" suggested making Japan an aggressive base in the Pacific, with the malicious intention of selling out the Japanese people as cannon fodder.

　　The statement finally emphasized: The Japanese Communist Party will fight for a comprehensive peace, national independence, and peace.

　　日本共产党及其他进步党派团体坚决反对日本重新武装
    决议发动要求签订全面和约运动
    日共声明斥责芦田再武装《意见书》
    【新华社二十五日讯】据电通社东京消息：日本共产党、劳农党、左翼社会党组织以及七十个工人与其他民主团体的代表，曾于一月中旬举行大会。大会决议发动全国规模的要求签订全面对日和约运动，坚决反对日本重新武装。与会代表一致认为“在订立和约以后立即撤退一切占领军，对于日本的独立与和平生存是必要的”。
    另据联合通讯社消息：和平签名及全面和约的群众运动，正在兵库县活跃地进行着。在该县神户市，以“川崎制铁公司”的工人为首，其他工人以及中小企业家、主妇等，向该地被迫害的朝鲜侨民捐送慰劳袋，同时并征集和平签名与全面和约投票。该市“保卫和平之会”的女会员，在放映反战影片《不设防的城市》的电影院门前，征集和平签名与全面和约投票。第一天，仅在两小时内就获得三百零六人的响应。
    【新华社二十四日讯】据联合通讯社一月六日消息：日本共产党发表声明，斥责因贪污受贿而声名狼籍的前日本首相及民主党（现在的国民民主党的前身）总裁芦田均鼓吹所谓“自卫力强化”的《意见书》。芦田在他去年十二月提给麦克阿瑟总部的《意见书》中，无耻地为再武装日本计划献策。
    日共声明称：芦田均的《意见书》并不仅是他个人的意见，它有着日本法西斯主义阵营的先锋作用，是对要求和平与独立的日本民族的无耻的挑战。它是在所谓“自主的防卫”的掩饰下，借“协助联合国的国民运动”的名义，企图复活日本军国主义和法西斯主义。声明并指出：这个《意见书》建议使日本成为太平洋的侵略基地，它具有出卖日本民族充当炮灰的恶毒的用意。
    声明最后强调称：日本共产党将为全面媾和、民族独立与和平而斗争。
