　　The Guoluo People Support Chairman Mao's Trade Policy
    Transporting Wool to Exchange for Daily Necessities
    [Reported by this newspaper] The Guoluo compatriots, cruelly massacred by the Ma bandits of Bu Fang, live in the Bayan Har Mountains of Qinghai, eat *Jiaoma* (a kind of wild grass with underground stems), drink cow's blood, and live a nomadic life, having been isolated from their compatriots in the interior for thirty-two years. The people's government's trade policy of purchasing a large quantity of native products in pastoral areas, increasing people's income, and providing sufficient industrial products and daily necessities to pastoral areas has inspired Xianba Longbu, a chieftain of the Guoluo people, and a group of forty-three people to climb mountains and wade through rivers, risking their lives to transport more than 9,000 *jin* of wool to Huangyuan County, Qinghai. They were warmly received by the local trade company, and their wool was purchased at a reasonable price, allowing them to exchange it for more than 700 bags of grain, more than 100 bolts of cloth, and more than 50 packages of Fucha tea. They warmly praised the people's government and thanked Chairman Mao. They were also taken to Xining City, where Chairman Zhao Shoushan personally met them and hosted a cordial welcoming banquet and accompanied them to see a play. Comrades from the Central Visiting Group presented them with photographs of Chairman Mao and commemorative badges. The Central Epidemic Prevention Team No. 7 even provided them with free medical treatment. In order to bring the people's government's enthusiasm and care for fraternal nationalities to their fellow compatriots, and to express their gratitude for the benefits the trade company gave them by purchasing their wool, they requested to take a group photo with Xue Hongfu, Director of the Qinghai Provincial Department of Industry and Commerce, and Wang Zenong and Liu Zhaogong, managers of the trade company. When they returned, they said that they would definitely convey the people's government's love for them to every one of their compatriots, and encourage everyone to transport wool and hides to exchange for the things they need.

    运出羊毛换生活必需品
    【本报讯】被马匪步芳残酷虐杀，居住在青海巴颜喀喇山，吃角麻（一种有地下茎的野草），饮牛血，过着游牧生活的果洛族同胞，已经和内地同胞隔绝三十二年了。人民政府在牧区大量收购土产，增加人民收入，并充足供应牧区工业品及生活必需品的贸易政策，感召着果洛族显巴隆布百户等一行四十三人，爬山涉水，冒着生命危险，运了九千余斤羊毛，到达青海的湟源县。他们受到了当地贸易公司热情招待，并以合理价格收下他们的羊毛，使他们换到了七百多袋粮食，一百多匹布，五十余封茯茶。他们热烈地赞扬着人民政府，感谢着毛主席。他们并被接到西宁市，赵寿山主席亲自接见，亲切的设宴欢迎，陪同看戏；中央访问团的同志赠给他们毛主席的像片和纪念章；中央防疫第七队更免费为他们治病。为了把人民政府对兄弟民族的热情和关怀带给同族同胞，并表示感谢贸易公司收购羊毛给予他们的利益，他们并要求和青海省工商厅长薛宏福、贸易公司经理王泽农、刘肇功等合影留念。他们返回时表示一定把人民政府对他们的热爱传达给同族每一个人，鼓舞大家把羊毛皮子运出来，换回他们需要的东西。
