I am willing to dedicate everything I have
Ba Jin

Editor's Note: This is the draft of the speech prepared by Mr. Ba Jin, the representative of China at the Second World Peace Congress in Warsaw. It was not used at the time because there were many speakers from various delegations.

I come from China. This country, which has always been regarded as a mystery by Westerners, has a long history and a culture that once shone brilliantly. This country has vast and beautiful mountains and rivers, rich underground treasures, and 475 million hardworking people. But it is also this country where its people have groaned generation after generation under the brutal politics of autocratic dictators and the exploitative methods of feudal landlords, withering away and dying. They endured hunger and cold, laboring like cattle and horses, only to obtain a meager existence. But they never lost the courage to fight, and the fire of resistance continued to burn among them. They rose one after another to fight for their freedom. Finally, the day came when the power of the people became a blazing fire that melted gold and refined steel, burning away all the poisonous weeds and evil trees of autocratic politics and feudalism. Thus, a new China, a China of the people, was born.

I come from Shanghai, China. Shanghai, this world-famous metropolis, some call it the city of sin, others call it the paradise of adventurers. One ocean-going ship after another carried batches of adventurers, who transported raw materials from overseas, used the cheap labor here to make goods, and obtained a vast market. They built tall buildings and lived comfortable and luxurious lives, while the people of Shanghai huddled in cold small houses, swaying lofts, hard sidewalks, and even in the awning boats on the Suzhou Creek. Here, tens of thousands of workers exhausted their lives under unsanitary working conditions for meager wages. Here, children starved, women were humiliated, peaceful people were shot, and the most precious thing in the world—labor power—was wasted and ruined. This is the achievement of imperialism's century of trampling on China. But today, all this has disappeared like a nightmare. Shanghai, like other Chinese cities, has returned to the hands of the people. The torrent of the people's revolution washed away the dirty filth of imperialism. A new Shanghai has been born.

This is a new beginning, a glorious beginning. I mention this here not to deliberately boast about the achievements of the people's revolution and arouse the fear of the ruling class of imperialist countries. I am only here to explain that the Chinese people drove away imperialism and overthrew the reactionary rulers for a peaceful purpose—to build China better and more beautiful, and this has already been proven by facts; and also to give the world an example: how an ancient nation can be reborn.

As a writer, I believe that my task is to promote peace, my task is to connect humanity together. I want every mouth to have bread, every home to have a house, every child to be educated, and every person's wisdom to have the opportunity to flourish. As a Chinese, I can say that we love peace, cherish peace, and need peace more than anyone else. Our rich literary heritage contains many brilliant poems against unjust wars. We need peace because only in peace can we have full opportunities for construction, and we have only achieved peace after a long period of war.

But now this peace is threatened. American imperialists do not allow us to enjoy the happiness of peace, nor do they give us the opportunity for peaceful construction. Their iron hooves have already stepped on our borders, and their flames of war have already burned before our eyes. Our land is being bombed, and our people are being strafed. On the other side of the Pacific, there are still people shouting that "the fear of war obscures the hope of mankind." It seems that a great massacre is about to happen, and a great destruction is about to arrive immediately. Today, there is indeed a large dark cloud covering the hope of mankind. The hundreds and thousands of tons of American bombs falling on Korean territory are a serious threat to human civilization.

But the hope of mankind cannot be obscured by any large dark cloud. Especially today, peace is not a dream, an ideal. It is the wish of all people. It already has eight hundred million defenders united together, no, this is only a partial number. Because everyone knows that among the people of the world, there is no one who does not love peace, no one who does not hate war. There is no one who is unwilling to live in harmony with his compatriots and his neighbors, and no one who does not hope to use his wisdom and his labor to jointly create a new world civilization. Only a very few people crave war and want to profit from war. We call this small group of people warmongers. They instigate war, launch war, use all kinds of flowery words to deceive innocent young people onto the battlefield, and use all kinds of barbaric and brutal means to drive peaceful young people into the war zone, killing innocent lives, destroying peaceful cities, opening up vast markets for them, and enslaving weak nations. I don't know how many young and promising lives have been sacrificed in such battlefields.

The kingdom of aggressors is built with these white bones and red blood. They constantly use various bloodthirsty methods to expand it and consolidate it. Now they want to take the civilization created by the labor and wisdom of our ancestors for generations as the price, in exchange for the golden tops of their palaces, and complete their "eternal" hegemony.

But their good dream will not come true. We, the Chinese people, will not let it come true, and the people of the world will not let it come true. They want to expand and consolidate their kingdom, and we want to destroy it. We use words, we use actions, we use facts to destroy it.

As conscientious writers, we have a responsibility to unite humanity and help the people of the world unite. Putting aside different beliefs, putting aside different religions, putting aside different languages, as long as they are good people, as long as they are people who love humanity, let us unite together, fight to defend peace, and fight to create a new civilization. We have the power to make deceived people open their eyes, we have the responsibility to rescue those young lives who are about to be used as cannon fodder, and we are even more confident to see the collapse of the aggressors' kingdom.

"A horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse!" The hunchbacked tyrant Richard III once shouted like this. But by that time, he couldn't even get a horse. He lost his kingdom and lost his life. One day, those new tyrants will also make the same desperate cry. In defeat, the tyrants are so powerless, and their kingdom becomes a fragile, paper-made thing.

When I left my home to come here, my five-year-old daughter clung to my neck, reluctant to let go, and said that she wanted Daddy to come home early and bring her a gift. I love my daughter. Every father loves his children. The younger generation is indeed lovely. Our generation has suffered enough from war. But I don't want to see a tear in the young little eyes, I don't want to see anyone hurt a tender hair. I believe all fathers are like this. We should create a better environment, a more beautiful future for the children. For the sake of the younger generation, I am willing to dedicate everything I have.

### 我愿意献出我的一切

　　我愿意献出我的一切
    巴金
    编者按：这是中国出席华沙第二届世界保卫和平大会代表巴金先生准备在大会上发言的稿子，当时因各国代表团发言的人很多，此稿未用。
    我从中国来。这个一直被西方人当作谜一样的国家，有着悠久的历史和曾经发过灿烂光辉的文化。这个国家有着广大的山明水秀的国土，丰富的地下宝藏和四亿七千五百万刻苦耐劳的人民。但也就是这个国家，它的人民一代一代地呻吟在专制独夫的残暴政治和封建地主的剥削手段下面憔悴死去。他们忍饥受寒，像牛马似的劳动着，换得他们的简单的生存。但是他们也从没有失去斗争的勇气，反抗的火不断地在他们中间燃烧，他们前仆后继地起来争取他们的自由。终于到了这样的一天，人民的力量成了一股烁金炼钢的烈火，烧尽了一切专制政治和封建主义的恶草毒树。于是一个新的中国，人民的中国产生了。
    我从中国的上海来。上海，这个世界闻名的都市，有人唤它做罪恶的城市，有人称它为冒险家的乐园。一只一只的远洋轮船载来一批一批的冒险家，他们从海外运来原料，利用这里的廉价的劳动力制成商品，取得了广大的市场。他们建造了高楼大厦，过着舒适豪华的生活，而上海的人民却蜷缩在寒冷的小屋内，摇动的搁楼里，坚硬的人行道上，甚至在苏州河上的乌篷船中。在这里成千上万的工人为着微小的工资把生命消耗在不卫生的工作条件下面。在这里小孩挨饿，妇女受辱，和平的人民被人枪杀，人间最可宝贵的东西——劳动力被浪费被糟塌。这就是帝国主义百年来蹂躏中国的成绩。然而在今天这一切都像梦魇似地消灭了。上海跟别的中国城市一样也回到了人民的手中。人民革命的洪流把帝国主义的肮脏污秽冲洗干净了。新的上海产生了。
    这是一个新的开始，一个光辉的开始。我在这里提说这个，并不是有意夸耀人民革命的成就，引起帝国主义国家的统治阶级的恐惧。我只是来说明：中国人民赶走了帝国主义，推翻了反动的统治者，是为着一个和平的企图——把中国建设得更好，更美丽，而且这已经有事实证明了；同时也给世界一个榜样：一个古老的民族怎样可以新生。
    作为一个作家，我认为我的任务是宣传和平的，我的任务是把人类连结在一起的。我愿意每个口都有面包，每个家都有住宅，每个小孩都受教育，每个人的智慧都有机会发扬。作为一个中国人，我可以说，我们比谁都更爱和平，更宝贵和平，更需要和平。我们的丰富的文学遗产中就有不少光辉的反对非正义的战争的诗篇。我们需要和平，因为只有在和平中我们才可以得到充分的建设的机会，而且我们是经过了长时期的战争之后才达到和平的。
    但是现在这和平受到威胁了。美国帝国主义者不让我们享受和平的幸福，不给我们以和平建设的机会。他们的铁蹄已经踏到我们的国境，他们的烽火已经烧到我们的眼前。我们的土地被轰炸，我们的人民被扫射。在太平洋的彼岸还有人发出“战争的畏惧掩蔽了人类的希望”的叫嚣。似乎大残杀马上便要发生，大毁灭立刻就要到来。在今天的确有一片大的乌云盖在人类的希望上面。落在朝鲜领土上的成千成百吨的美国的炸弹便是对人类文明的严重的威胁。
    但是人类的希望是任何大的乌云所掩蔽不了的。特别是在今天和平不是一个梦，一个理想。它是万人的愿望。它已经有了团结在一起的八亿的保卫者，不，这只是一部分的数目。因为谁都知道在全世界的人民中没有一个人不爱和平，没有一个人不恨战争。没有一个人不愿意跟他的同胞，跟他的邻人和睦相处，没有一个人不希望用他的智慧和他的劳力来共同创造新世界的文明。渴望战争，想从战争中得利的只有极少数的人，这一小撮人我们称他们为战争贩子。他们鼓动战争，发动战争，用种种的花言巧语把天真的年青人骗上战场，用种种的野蛮残暴的手段把和平的年青人驱入战地，杀害无辜的生命，毁灭和平的城市，替他们开辟广大的市场，奴役弱小的民族。不知道已经有多少年青有为的生命牺牲在这样的战场中了。
    侵略者的王国就是用这些白骨赤血造成的。他们不断地用种种渴血的方法扩大它，巩固它。现在他们更想拿我们祖先累世的劳力和智慧创造出来的文明作代价，换取他们宫殿的金顶，完成他们的“万世不朽”的霸业。
    但是他们的这个好梦是不会实现的。我们中国人民不让它实现，全世界的人民也不让它实现。他们要扩大，巩固他们的王国，我们要摧毁它。我们用语言，用行动，用事实来摧毁它。
    作为有良心的作家，我们有责任结合人类，帮助全世界的人民团结起来。撇开不同的信仰，撇开不同的宗教，撇开不同的语言，只要是善良的人，只要是爱人类的人，让我们团结在一起，为保卫和平而奋斗，为创造新的文明而奋斗。我们有力量使受骗的人睁开眼，我们有责任救出那些即将充当炮灰的年青的生命，我们更有把握看见侵略者的王国的崩溃。
    “拿我的王国换一匹马”，驼背的暴君理却三世曾经这样绝叫过。可是到了那时候他连一匹马也得不到了，他失了他的王国，也失了他的生命。有一天那些新的暴君也会发出同样绝望的叫声。在败亡的时候暴君们是多么地没有力量，他们的王国也就成了不堪一击的纸糊的东西了。
    我离开我的家动身到这里来的时候，我的五岁的女儿依恋不舍地抱住我的颈项说，要爸爸早回家来，要爸爸带礼物给她。我爱我的女儿。每个父亲都爱他的孩子。年青的一代的确是可爱的。我们这一代已经受够战争的苦难了。可是我不愿意看见年青的小眼睛上有一滴泪水，我不愿意看见谁伤害一根柔嫩的头发。我相信所有的父亲都是这样的。我们应该给孩子们创造一个更好的环境，一个更美丽的将来。为着年青的一代，我愿意献出我的一切。
