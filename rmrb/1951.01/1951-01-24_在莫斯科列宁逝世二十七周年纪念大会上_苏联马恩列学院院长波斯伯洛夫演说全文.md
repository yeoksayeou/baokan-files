Comrades:

　　It has been twenty-seven years since the death of Lenin, the greatest genius of mankind. The great Party of Lenin-Stalin has achieved historically significant victories in the past twenty-odd years, mainly because it is faithful to Lenin's doctrine and faithful to his legacy. Lenin's immortal ideas illuminate the path of the Soviet people towards communism; Lenin's immortal doctrine illuminates the path of all working people in their struggle for liberation from imperialist oppression; they reveal the laws and prospects of the development of human society; they inspire people to deeply believe in the inevitable and final victory of the proletarian revolution over the imperialist beast.

Lenin on the Aggressive and Predatory Nature of U.S. Imperialism

　　On this 27th anniversary of Lenin's death, the publication of the fourth edition of the Complete Works of Lenin, which began in 1940 according to the decision of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), has been completed. In these works of Lenin—his genius works, works that are essential for all those building communism to study—we find teachings that help us understand the current political situation more deeply and clarify our current tasks. The fourth edition of the Complete Works of Lenin is more complete than previous editions, adding many new materials and documents, some of which contain Lenin's views on U.S. imperialism. These materials and documents depict from all aspects the role played by U.S. imperialism in the early days of the young Russian Soviet Republic—as an active organizer and instigator of military intervention against it. At present, U.S. imperialism has become the leading force in the camp of warmongers, it is engaged in a frenzied arms expansion campaign, has launched a bloody aggression against the peace-loving Korean people, and is also plotting to launch new military offensives against the socialist country, the Soviet Union, the European People's Democracies, and the People's Republic of China. In such an international situation, Lenin's exposition of the characteristics of U.S. imperialism is particularly instructive and very timely. Lenin once pointed out that U.S. imperialism constantly interferes in the affairs of other countries, and it does so in the form of blatant military intervention, enslaving these countries and strangling them with hunger. Lenin repeatedly emphasized the aggressive and predatory nature of U.S. imperialism.

　　Lenin's views on U.S. imperialism pinpoint the root cause of the evil policy pursued by the American ruling circles shortly after the end of World War II, a policy of undermining international cooperation and launching another world war in order to establish their world hegemony.

Lenin on U.S. Intervention in the Russian Revolution

　　U.S. imperialists began to interfere in Russian affairs even before October 1917, attempting to crush the Russian revolution in order to completely enslave Russia and plunder its natural resources without hindrance.

　　After the February Revolution, U.S. imperialists gave all kinds of support to the counter-revolutionary Kerensky-Miliukov alliance, providing it with billions of dollars in order to strangle the Russian revolution and enslave Russia; U.S. imperialists at that time had already regarded Russia as their "colony." It is appropriate to recall this fact: in October 1917, U.S. Ambassador to Russia Francis asked U.S. Secretary of State Lansing: "What do you think about treating Russia in the same way as China?" ("Foreign Relations of Russia in 1918," Vol. 1, p. 266).

　　Of course, he was referring to the old China, the semi-colonial China, bound by various oppressive unequal treaties imposed by imperialist countries. Today, after the Chinese people have achieved historic victories, even the most die-hard American diplomats dare not talk about China in this way. Today, as the saying goes, they have the will but lack the strength.

　　The victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution, led and inspired by the Party of Lenin and Stalin, guaranteed our country's sovereignty and independence, protecting it from the unreasonable infringements of U.S. imperialists. Therefore, it is not without reason that the victory of the October Revolution aroused the strong hatred of the American plutocratic groups. Since the October Revolution, they have been the mortal enemies of Soviet Russia.

　　The Soviet government, in the first decree of the Great October Socialist Revolution—the Decree on Peace—openly proposed seeking a just peace—a peace that fully respects the equal rights of all countries; it suggested such a peace to all belligerent countries, thus pointing out to the peoples of all countries the way to end the imperialist war. The U.S., British, and French imperialists were concerned with prolonging that bloody massacre, and they rejected the proposal of the young Soviet Republic.

　　"It was the bourgeoisie of England, France, and America who rejected our proposal, who even refused to negotiate with us for a general peace! It was they who betrayed the interests of the peoples, who plotted the imperialist slaughter!" Lenin said in his famous August 1918 "Letter to American Workers" (Lenin's Collected Works, Russian ed., Vol. 28, pp. 46, 47).

　　The Decree on Peace—the powerful call of the revolutionary workers' and peasants' government for a just peace—aroused the special hatred of the U.S. imperialists, for whom ending the war was unfavorable because they were reaping incredible profits from military contracts.

　　It was the American ruling circles who initiated the hunger blockade against Soviet Russia as early as 1917. At that time, American newspapers shamelessly and openly declared that the United States had prohibited the transport of food to Russia; it would be prohibited as long as the Bolsheviks were in power and carrying out their plans for peace (Foreign Relations of Russia, 1918, vol. 1, p. 266). As early as the beginning of 1918, U.S. imperialism was plotting to dismember Soviet Russia and preparing to implement direct military intervention against our country to achieve this goal. At that time, some ignorant and arrogant American senators, thinking that it would be easy to seize some loot, mustered up the courage to assert that Russia had become a "geographical concept" and therefore could be robbed with impunity. A senator named Poindexter, a fellow of low intelligence with the same views as the theorists of German imperialism, sympathetically cited their imagined fiction, saying that the Soviet Union "is nothing but a geographical concept, and will never be anything else. Its unity, its power to reorganize and to build, is gone, never to return. The country no longer exists..." (Congressional Record, vol. 56, 1918, part 2, pp. 11, 179).

　　Then, when talking about U.S. intervention in the affairs of Central and Southeastern European countries, Poindexter said with unparalleled arrogance that a more important question was how to deal with the Soviet Union, with its 170 million people and unlimited amounts of food, fuel, and metal resources (pp. 11, 177).

　　Another equally "far-sighted" Senator Sherman, at the Senate meeting on June 20, 1918, urged the U.S. government to accelerate and intensify armed intervention against the Soviet Union, and he especially wanted the government to pay attention to how delicious Siberia was. Sherman said: "Siberia is a valuable wheat-producing region and livestock area, and it is also a mineral-rich area." (Congressional Record, vol. 56, 1918, part 8, p. 8064). However, it was not only Siberia that aroused the greed of American plunderers. The Caucasus and its natural resources also aroused their covetousness.

Lenin on U.S. Imperialism as a Butcher and Gendarme Destroying Freedom

　　U.S. President Wilson was one of the main instigators of armed intervention against the young Soviet Republic under the guise of the hypocritical lie of non-interference in Russia. In his Letter to American Workers, Lenin called Wilson "a lackey of the American plutocrats, a capitalist wolf." (Lenin's Complete Works, Vol. 28, p. 52)

　　U.S. imperialists attempted to destroy the Soviet state in 1918-1920. Immediately after the Great October Socialist Revolution, American diplomats immediately began to plan counter-revolutionary conspiracies against the Soviet government and sent American troops to Soviet Russia for direct intervention. U.S. imperialists and the American troops they sent under the hypocritical banner of defending "overseas democracy" supported the most brutal executioners of the Russian people, the most insane counter-revolutionaries and monarchists—Kolchak, Miller, Denikin, and other White Guards.

　　The behavior of the American interventionist forces in the north was even more despicable and shameful. There, under the pretext of "suppressing the Bolsheviks," they and the White Guards brutally murdered millions of Russian people and looted large quantities of valuable raw materials.

　　If you want to know how the American "democrats" behaved, we only need to cite the following incident to illustrate it well: in the northern region occupied by the American and British aggressors at that time, prisons and concentration camps were densely packed, and thousands upon thousands of Russian people were thrown into prison by the American and British interventionists and their White Guard lackeys.

　　The hands of the U.S. imperialists are stained with the blood of the Russian people. The Soviet people will never forget the bloody atrocities and massacres committed by the American interventionists on our land!

　　During the years of foreign military intervention and civil war, the Soviet people bravely and heroically repelled the criminal and predatory invasion carried out by the U.S., Britain, and other countries with the support of their White Guard lackeys.

　　Lenin expressed his views on the criminal invasion of our country by the American interventionists and the heroic resistance of the Russian people in his "Answers to Questions from an American Journalist" in July 1919.

　　Lenin wrote at that time: "For America and Japan, our political goal is mainly to repel their unreasonable, criminal, and predatory invasion of Russia, an action only for the sake of their capitalists making a fortune. We have repeatedly made solemn peace proposals to these two countries. But they did not even reply, and continued to wage war against us, they aided Denikin and Kolchak, looted Murmansk and Archangel, especially looting and ravaging Eastern Siberia, but there the Russian peasants heroically resisted the capitalist bandits of Japan and America.

　　For all countries, including America and Japan, we have only one political and economic goal, that is, to establish a fraternal alliance with the workers and working people of all countries without exception." (Lenin's Complete Works, Vol. 29, pp. 477-478).

　　In order to clarify the predatory plans and intentions of U.S. imperialism, it should be pointed out that when the so-called "peace messenger" and "democrat" President Wilson attended the Paris Peace Conference in January 1919, he carried with him a plan to destroy the Soviet Republic and completely divide Russia. It stipulated that the Caucasus should be separated from the territory of Russia and placed under the "mandate" of the United States.

　　Lenin pointed out in his many works: "Wilson's idealized democratic republic has actually proved to be the most vicious form of imperialism carrying out the most shameless oppression and suppression of all weak countries." (Lenin's Complete Works, Vol. 28, p. 161) Lenin rebuked U.S. imperialism as a butcher and murderer strangling Russia's freedom, as a gendarme of Western Europe.

　　Lenin said: "Facts show that Britain and the United States are acting as butchers and gendarmes who are destroying Russia's freedom, just as the Russian butcher Nicholas I ruled, and no less than the butchers who strangled the Hungarian revolution. This role is currently being played by Wilson's agents. They are stifling the revolution in Austria, they are playing the role of gendarme, they have issued an ultimatum to Switzerland saying: if you do not participate in the struggle against the anti-Bolshevik government, we will not give you food. They said to the Netherlands: do not allow Soviet ambassadors to enter the country, otherwise we will blockade you. Their weapons are very simple—the noose of hunger. This is their weapon to strangle other countries." (Lenin's Complete Works, Vol. 28, p. 188)

Lenin on U.S. Imperialism Heading Towards the Same End as German Imperialism

　　Lenin pointed out that although U.S. imperialists have a mask of "democracy," they are no better than beastly German imperialism, and they are heading towards the same shameful end as German imperialism.

　　Lenin said at the Sixth Extraordinary All-Russian Congress of Soviets in 1918: "We see that Britain and the United States originally had greater opportunities to continue to maintain themselves as democratic republics, but now they have become as barbaric and arrogant as Germany was in its heyday, so they will also reach the same end just as quickly, or even more quickly, the end that German imperialism so perfectly achieved. German imperialism initially expanded incredibly, all the way to encompassing three-quarters of Europe, it grew fat, but suddenly it burst open, leaving behind a terrible stench. British and American imperialism are currently rushing towards such an end." (Lenin's Complete Works, Russian ed., Vol. 28, p. 138).

　　Lenin pointed out that German imperialism acted as a murderer of the revolutionary workers and peasants of Russia and Ukraine in 1918, and in doing so dug its own grave: the originally disciplined German army became demoralized.

　　Lenin predicted that "when British and American imperialism carry out that adventure that will lead them to political collapse, when they order their troops to act as murderers and gendarmes suppressing the whole of Europe, they will also dig their own graves." (Lenin's Complete Works, Russian ed., Vol. 28, p. 141).

　　These words of Lenin are a stern warning to the wildly arrogant political lunatics of the American ruling circles, who, with the desire to seize world hegemony, are driving the American people into the abyss of a new Third World War at such a frantic speed.

　　Now, U.S. imperialism, which neither understands world history nor has learned from history, is following in the footsteps of Nazi imperialism step by step. At this time, Lenin's predictions have particularly powerful force.

　　Lenin taught us that "British and American imperialism are just as much beasts as German imperialism." He exposed the plans and actions of British and American imperialists aimed at suppressing and oppressing the people of Russia and Western Europe, saying: "They are trying to subdue the people who are moving from capitalism to freedom, they are trying to strangle the revolution. We can say with great certainty that this greedy beast is now about to repeat the same mistakes as the German imperialist beast and fall into the abyss." (Lenin's Complete Works, Russian ed., Vol. 28, p. 14).

Lenin on the Soviet Union Growing Stronger in Victory

　　The bankruptcy of all attempts at foreign armed intervention in Soviet Russia was a great victory of the working people over international imperialism. The great victory of the young Soviet Republic over countless enemies proved that the Great October Socialist Revolution was in accordance with the laws of history. This revolution opened a new era in human history.

　　In October 1920, when talking about the incomparably great significance of the failure of international imperialist armed intervention, Lenin predicted: "From the actions of all countries participating in international politics, we have gained a great objective lesson: our cause is deeply rooted, although there are attempts to invade Russia and wage war against Russia—such attempts will undoubtedly occur, and more than once—but we have been tempered by experience and become stronger, and we have learned from practical experience that all these attempts will end in utter failure. After each attack by our enemies, we will become stronger." (Lenin's Complete Works, Vol. 31, p. 304).

　　History has confirmed Lenin's brilliant prediction. When Nazi imperialism, nurtured and fed by American monopoly enterprises, perfidiously attacked the Soviet Union in 1941, the socialist country, under the wise leadership of the great leader and strategist Comrade Stalin, defeated Hitler's Germany and, after this unprecedentedly harsh struggle, became even stronger than before 1941 (sustained applause).

　　Today, even our most vicious enemies have to admit this indisputable historical fact. Even such a despicable reactionary as U.S. Senator Taft has to admit that the plans of American aggressors to fight Russia with ground troops on the European continent are doomed to failure, that this is "an impossible aggression, Napoleon and Hitler understood this after paying the price" (Pravda, January 8, 1951).

　　After defeating foreign military intervention, Lenin taught us to remember: the first precept of our policy is "to be constantly vigilant, to remember that we are surrounded by those who openly express the deepest hatred for us, those classes and governments. We must remember that we are at risk of being invaded at any time. We will do everything in our power to avoid this disaster." (Lenin's Complete Works, Russian ed., Vol. 33, p. 122).

Lenin on the Barbaric Beastliness of U.S. Imperialism

　　Lenin, in analyzing the international situation after World War I, said that U.S. imperialists had made a great fortune in this war, stolen vast wealth, become unprecedentedly arrogant, and interfered even more shamelessly in the affairs of other countries. In his Letter to American Workers, Lenin said: "The American plutocrats are perhaps the richest in the world, and their geographical position is perhaps the safest. They have made themselves richer than anyone else. They have made all countries, even the richest countries, their tributaries. They have stolen hundreds of billions of dollars. On every dollar there is a stain of a 'profitable' military contract. These military contracts have made the rich richer and the poor poorer in every country. On every dollar there is blood—the traces of a sea of blood of ten million killed and twenty million maimed." (Lenin's Complete Works, Russian ed., Vol. 28, p. 46).

　　Lenin proved that as early as 1918, British and American imperialism were already seizing world hegemony.

　　Lenin said: "British and American imperialism are more shameless than before, and think of themselves as supreme emperors who no one can resist." (Lenin's Complete Works, Russian ed., Vol. 28, p. 353) Lenin listed many examples to illustrate that nowhere is the rule of capital as arrogant, shameless, and barbaric as it is in the United States, despite their high-sounding talk of democracy and equality for all citizens.

　　Lenin repeatedly urged everyone to pay attention to the hideous and barbaric instincts that the U.S. imperialist rulers were cultivating in 1917-1920, and the cruelty with which they persecuted revolutionary workers, even those who only advocated peace.

　　In 1918, Lenin said at a meeting of workers' representatives in the Presnya district: "Wilson is the president of the most democratic republic in the world. And what does he say? In that country, chauvinist mobs shoot people in the street simply because these people said a word for peace. A clergyman who had never participated in the revolution was dragged into the street and beaten to a bloody pulp simply for preaching peace." (Lenin's Complete Works, Russian ed., Vol. 28, p. 337).

　　Lenin was referring to the peace advocate Reverend Beechler, who "was whipped by twenty people wearing masks and black hoods. They whipped him skillfully and rhythmically (an eyewitness, a New York Times reporter, described the incident). Beechler bent over in pain and finally fell to the ground. While he was lying on the ground, they continued to whip him, totaling about two thousand whips, with blood mixed with the tar smeared on this unfortunate man. As they dragged him home along the sidewalk, no one could tell whether they were dragging a living person or a dead person."

　　However, this victim of lynch law was fortunate enough not to die. Beechler went to Washington to see the president and complain to him. But the result was unexpected. Two weeks later, Beechler himself was put on trial, charged with "unpatriotic and open sympathy for non-belligerents" (actually peace advocates).

　　A week after this shameful incident, seventeen members of the "Industrial Workers of the World" also encountered the same barbaric treatment as Beechler; three of them died the next day.

　　This is the demeanor of U.S. imperialism, this is the "American way of life"!

　　When talking about the abominable beastliness and arrogance of U.S. imperialism, Lenin said:

　　"Here we see a completely naked imperialism, which does not even think it necessary to slightly cover up its naked prototype, thinking that it is best as it is now." (Lenin's Complete Works, Vol. 31, p. 416).

　　Even then, in the 1920s, Lenin pointed out that the predatory policy of U.S. imperialism was arousing the growing hatred of the people of all countries.

　　In December 1920, Lenin said at a meeting of cadres of the Moscow organization of the Russian Communist Party: "America is strong, they all owe it money, everything depends on it, but they are all becoming more and more hateful of it, it has robbed everyone. All the bourgeois publications confirm this growing hatred of America." (Lenin's Complete Works, Vol. 31, pp. 419, 420).

Lenin on Soviet Russia's Unwavering Commitment to Peace

　　In these remarks on foreign policy, Lenin always emphasized Soviet Russia's unwavering hope for peace.

　　Lenin's answer to the questions posed by a reporter from the American newspaper New York Evening Journal (February 1920) is of great importance. This question-and-answer session was published for the first time in the fourth edition of Lenin's Complete Works.

　　The reporter asked: "What is the basis for peace with the United States?"

　　Lenin replied: "Let the American capitalists leave us alone, and we will leave them alone. We are even prepared to exchange gold for machines, tools, and other things that are useful for transportation and production, and not only gold, but also raw materials."

　　In answering the question, "What are the obstacles to such a peace?" Lenin said:

　　"There are none on our side, the obstacles are on the side of the capitalists in the United States (and all other countries), that is, imperialism." (Lenin's Complete Works, Russian ed., Vol. 30, p. 340).

The Chinese and Korean People Gave the Aggressors a Devastating Blow

　　The predatory and plundering nature of U.S. imperialism repeatedly mentioned by Lenin, its ambition to dominate the world and enslave Asia and Europe—these characteristics of U.S. imperialism have been particularly powerfully manifested since World War II. In an attempt to dominate the world, U.S. and British imperialists have launched bloody colonial wars against the people of Eastern countries. American troops are carrying out unprecedented atrocities on the territory of the peace-loving and freedom-loving Korean people. The Korean people are resisting American aggressors with great courage and heroism, and together with the Chinese People's Volunteers are giving the aggressors a devastating blow.

　　When U.S. imperialists began their criminal armed intervention in Korea, they originally thought that they could intimidate the heroic Korean people and force them to submit by means of large-scale bombing and horrific atrocities. But the facts proved otherwise. Despite their great advantage in weapons, despite their mobilization of a large number of naval and air forces, the American troops suffered unprecedented military defeats in Korea. Many people who not long ago believed in "power" and even believed in the "inevitability of victory" of U.S. imperialism are now beginning to think twice. The military prestige of the United States has been seriously damaged in the minds of many people in Europe and Asia. On the other hand, the barbaric policy of the American bandits, who learned from the Hitler gang to burn prosperous cities and villages in Korea and turn them into "desert areas," has made U.S. imperialism strongly hated by the people of Europe, and even more so by the people of Asia.

　　Just as the past intervention in the Soviet Union suffered a disastrous defeat, the United States is also suffering a disastrous defeat in Korea today. There is no doubt that the foolish plan of the U.S. imperialists to dominate the world will end in complete failure.

　　The forces of war and imperialist reaction are confronted by the powerful and growing forces of peace, democracy, and socialism, headed by the great Soviet Union—the unshakable fortress of international peace and friendship.

Leninism is the Invincible Banner of Human Liberation

　　Lenin taught us that, according to the laws of history confirmed by the living historical experience, our great cause, the cause of liberating the working people from capitalist enslavement, is invincible! Lenin's immortal words inspire people with the highest confidence in the invincibility of the communist cause. No matter how barbaric the imperialist bourgeoisie may be, no matter what kind of vicious persecution they subject the advanced and conscious fighters of the working class—the Communists, and even ordinary peace fighters—to, the future still belongs to the advanced ideas of our era, and no "world police" (we know that the United States is assuming this role) can lock these ideas behind bars (applause).

　　The great Leninist-Stalinist ideas of international equality and friendship, the struggle for lasting world peace, are achieving and will achieve new and supreme victories (applause).

　　Lenin said in his famous book "Left-Wing Communism: An Infantile Disorder":

　　"Despite the bourgeoisie running around frantically, being wildly violent, acting arbitrarily, doing many stupid things, retaliating in advance against the Bolsheviks, and slaughtering (in India, Hungary, Germany, etc.) hundreds, thousands, or hundreds of thousands of Bolsheviks of tomorrow or yesterday: despite the bourgeoisie acting so recklessly, its fate is always the same as the fate of all the classes previously sentenced to death by history. Communists should know that the future world will in any case belong to them, so we can (and should) both show great enthusiasm in the struggle of the great revolution, and at the same time use the most calm and sober mind to assess the crazy and reckless actions of the bourgeoisie." (Lenin's Complete Works, Russian ed., Vol. 31, p. 81).

　　Comrades! We are commemorating the 27th anniversary of Lenin's death at the end of the first half of the 20th century. In the past half century, the ideas of Marxism-Leninism have achieved the greatest victories. Under the banner of this ideology, under the leadership of Comrade Stalin, the genius who continues Lenin's cause, the Soviet people have built socialism and are victoriously building a communist society. Under the banner of Leninist ideology, the world's workers' movement and national liberation movement have developed and are continuing to develop, and the struggle for peace, democracy, and socialism has been carried out and is continuing to be carried out.

　　Long live the wise Party of Lenin and Stalin, which leads us towards communism!

　　Long live world peace!

　　Long live Leninism, the invincible banner of the liberation of all mankind! (Long-lasting, stormy applause. All those attending the commemorative meeting stood up and sang the Party song "The Internationale.")

　　在莫斯科列宁逝世二十七周年纪念大会上
    苏联马恩列学院院长波斯伯洛夫演说全文
    【本报讯】综合新华社讯：据塔斯社消息：二十一日，苏联共产党中央委员会、苏联最高苏维埃主席团和俄罗斯联邦最高苏维埃主席团、莫斯科州与莫斯科市劳动人民代表苏维埃、苏联列宁共产主义青年团中央委员会、全苏工会中央理事会主席团，以及苏军代表和人民团体在莫斯科大剧院举行了列宁逝世二十七周年纪念大会。出席大会的有列宁伟大事业的继承人斯大林和苏联政府及苏联共产党的其他领袖莫洛托夫、马林科夫、贝利亚、伏罗希洛夫、卡冈诺维奇、安得烈也夫、赫鲁舍切夫、柯西金、什维尔尼克、苏斯洛夫、波诺马林科、施基利亚托夫等。在什维尔尼克致开会词后，苏联马恩列学院院长波斯伯洛夫作了关于列宁逝世二十七周年的报告。全文如下：同志们：
    自从人类最高的天才列宁逝世以来，至今已经二十七周年了。伟大的列宁——斯大林的党在过去二十几年中获得了具有历史意义的胜利，这主要是因为它忠实于列宁的学说，忠实于他的遗教。列宁的不朽的思想照耀着苏联人民走向共产主义的道路，列宁的不朽的学说照耀着一切劳动人民为摆脱帝国主义压迫而进行的解放斗争的道路；它们揭示了人类社会发展的法则和远景；它们鼓舞着人们深深地相信无产阶级革命战胜帝国主义野兽的必然的最后的胜利。
  列宁论美帝国主义的侵略性和掠夺性
    当此列宁逝世二十七周年纪念日，自一九四○年根据联共（布）中央委员会的决定而着手进行的列宁全集第四版的出版工作已告完成。在列宁的这些著作——他的天才的著作、一切建设共产主义的人们都极其必需研究的著作中，我们找到了帮助我们更深刻地了解今日政治情况及明了我们当前任务的教言。列宁全集第四版比前几版更为完备，它添进了许多新的材料和文献，其中一部分包含着列宁对美帝国主义的见解。这些材料和文献从各方面描绘了：在年青的俄罗斯苏维埃共和国建国初期美帝国主义所扮演的角色——对它进行军事干涉的积极组织者和鼓动者。目前，美帝国主义已变成战争贩子阵营的首要力量，它在从事疯狂的扩充军备的运动，已经对爱好和平的朝鲜人民发动了血腥的侵略，同时并在阴谋对社会主义国家苏联、对欧洲各人民民主国家和中华人民共和国发动新的军事进攻。在这样的国际形势之下，列宁对于美帝国主义之特点的阐述便特别有指导作用，而且非常合乎时宜。列宁曾经指出，美帝国主义不断地干涉他国的事务，而且是采用公然无忌的军事干涉的形式，奴役这些国家，用饥饿来绞杀它们。列宁曾经屡次着重指出美帝国主义的侵略性和掠夺性。
    列宁关于美帝国主义的这些见解，正道破了美国统治集团在第二次世界大战刚结束不久便奉行着的罪恶政策的根源，这一政策即是破坏国际合作，并为了建立他们的世界霸权而发动另一次世界大战的政策。
  列宁论美国对俄国革命的干涉
    美帝国主义者在一九一七年十月以前就开始干涉俄国的事务，力图粉碎俄国的革命以便彻底奴役俄国并毫无阻碍地掠夺其天然富源。
    二月革命以后，美帝国主义者给予反革命的克伦斯基——米留科夫联盟以各种支持，供给它以数十亿的金钱，以求扼杀俄国的革命与奴役俄罗斯；美帝国主义者当时便已把俄罗斯视为他们的“殖民地”。回忆一下这个事实是合宜的：一九一七年十月，美国驻俄国大使佛兰西斯曾请示美国国务卿蓝辛：“以对待中国的办法来对待俄国，您认为如何？”（“一九一八年俄国外交关系”第一卷第二百六十六页）。
    当然，他指的是旧的中国，半殖民地的中国，被帝国主义国家所强加的各种压迫性的不平等条约所束缚着的中国。今天，在伟大的中国人民取得了历史性的胜利以后，甚至最死硬的美国外交官也不敢这样谈论中国了。今天，像俗语说的，他们是心有余而力不足了。
    由列宁和斯大林的党所领导和鼓舞的伟大的十月社会主义革命的胜利，保障了我国的主权和独立，使之免遭美帝国主义者的无理侵犯。因此，十月革命的胜利招致了美国富豪集团的强烈憎恨，这不是没有理由的。他们自十月革命起，就是苏维埃俄罗斯的死敌。
    苏维埃政府在伟大十月社会主义革命的第一个法令——和平法令中，就公开地建议谋取公正的和平——完全尊重各国平等权利的和平；它向所有的交战国建议谋求这种和平，因而向各国人民指出了结束帝国主义战争的道路。美、英、法帝国主义者所关心的是把那次血腥屠杀延长下去，他们拒绝了年青的苏维埃共和国的建议。
    “拒绝我们的建议的正是英、法、美资产阶级，甚至拒绝和我们谈判普遍和平的正是他们！出卖各国人民利益的正是他们，策划帝国主义大屠杀的也是他们！”列宁在他著名的一九一八年八月“致美国工人书”中这样说过（列宁全集，俄文版，第二十八卷，第四十六、四十七页）。
    和平法令——革命的工农政府要求公正和平的有力号召，引起了美帝国主义者的特别的憎恨，对他们来说，结束战争是不利的，因为他们根据军事订货合同正在获取难以置信的暴利。
    在一九一七年便已倡议对苏俄实行饥饿封锁的就是美国统治集团。那时美国报纸恬不知耻地公然声言美国已经禁止将粮食运往俄国；只要布尔什维克一天掌握政权并且进行其媾和计划，便禁止一天（“一九一八年俄国外交关系”第一卷，第二六六页）。早在一九一八年初，美帝国主义便已阴谋肢解苏俄，并且准备对我国实行直接的军事干涉来达成这一目的。当时就有某些无知而骄横的美国参议员满以为很容易就可以劫得一些赃物，于是便鼓起勇气断言说俄国已经变成了一个“地理上的概念”，因此可以对它肆行抢劫而不会受到惩罚。一位名叫包恩德克斯特的参议员，是一个与德国帝国主义的理论家具有同样见解的智力低下的家伙，怀着同情之心援引他们所幻想的臆说，说什么苏联“只不过是一个地理上的概念，而不是别的，并且永远也不会是别的。它的团结力，重新组织的力量与建设力量已经一去不复返了。这个国家已不复存在……”（“美国国会纪录”第五十六卷，一九一八年，第二分册，第一一、一七九页）
    接着，包恩德克斯特在谈到美国对中欧与东南欧各国事务的干涉时，以无比的骄横说：一个更为重要的问题是怎样对付苏联，它的一亿七千万人民和无限量的食粮，燃料与金属资源（第一一、一七七页）。
    另一个同样“有远见的”参议员薛尔曼在参院一九一八年六月二十日的会议上，力促美国政府加速并加紧对苏联的武装干涉，他特别要政府注意西伯利亚是多么美味的珍馐。薛尔曼说：“西伯利亚是一块有价值的小麦产地与牧畜区，也是一个矿产丰富的地区。”（“美国国会纪录”第五十六卷，一九一八年，第八分册，第八、○六四页）。然而，引起美国掠夺者的贪欲的并不止西伯利亚。高加索及其天然富源也同样引起了他们的垂涎。
  列宁论美帝国主义是摧残自由的屠夫与宪兵
    美国总统威尔逊便是国际帝国主义在不干涉俄国的虚伪鬼话的掩饰下对年青的苏维埃共和国进行武装干涉的主要鼓动者之一。列宁在他的致美国工人书中把威尔逊称为“美国富豪头子、资本家豺狼的奴仆。”（列宁全集第二十八卷，第五十二页）
    美帝国主义者在一九一八——一九二○年曾企图摧毁苏维埃国家。在伟大的十月社会主义革命刚刚过后，美国外交家立即着手筹划反对苏维埃政府的反革命阴谋，并派遣美国军队到苏维埃俄罗斯进行直接干涉。美帝国主义者和他们在维护“海外民主”的虚伪旗帜下所派遣的美国军队，支持了俄国人民的最凶残的刽子手、最疯狂的反革命分子与保皇分子——高尔察克、米勒、邓尼金以及其他白卫军。
    美国干涉军在北方的行为更是卑污可耻，他们在那里以“戡平布尔什维克”为借口，和白卫军共同残酷地杀害了千千万万的俄国人民，劫走了大量贵重的原料。
    如果要知道美国“民主主义者”的行为怎样，我们只要举出下面一件事情便可以很好地说明了：在当时被美国和英国侵略者占领着的北方地区，到处密布着监狱和集中营，成千成万的俄国人民被美英干涉者及其白卫军走狗投入狱中。
    美帝国主义者的手上涂满了俄国人民的鲜血。苏维埃人民永远不会忘记美国干涉者在我国土地上所犯的血腥暴行和屠杀的“业迹”！
    在外国军事干涉和内战的年代里，苏维埃人民勇敢地英雄地打退了美国、英国和其他国家的干涉者在其走狗白卫军支持下所进行的掠夺的罪恶的入侵。
    列宁在一九一九年七月所做的“答美国记者问”里，就美国干涉者对我国的罪恶入侵和俄国人民的英勇抵抗，表示了他的意见。
    列宁当时写道：“对于美国和日本，我们的政治目标主要是打退它们对俄国的无理的、罪恶的、掠夺的入侵，它们这种行动只是为了它们的资本家发财致富。我们曾经多次向这两个国家提出庄严的和平建议。但是它们甚至不予答复，仍然继续对我们进行战争，它们援助邓尼金和高尔察克，掠夺摩尔曼斯克和阿尔干日尔斯克，特别是掠夺和蹂躏西伯利亚东部，但是在那里俄国农民对日本和美国的资本家盗匪进行了英雄的抵抗。
    对于一切国家，包括美国和日本在内，我们只有一个政治的与经济的目标，那就是毫无例外地和一切国家的工人及劳动人民建立兄弟般的联盟”。（列宁全集第二十九卷，第四七七——四七八页。）
    为了把美帝国主义的掠夺计划与意图说得清楚起见，应该指出：所谓“和平使者”和“民主分子”的威尔逊总统，在一九一九年一月莅临巴黎和会的时候，随身带着一个关于摧毁苏维埃共和国和完全瓜分俄国的计划。其中规定把高加索从俄国的版图上割出来置于美国的“委任统治”之下。
    列宁在他的许多著作中指出：“威尔逊的理想化的民主共和国，实际上证明是最凶恶的帝国主义对于一切弱小国家进行最无耻压迫和镇压的一种形式而已。”（列宁全集，第二十八卷，第一六一页。）列宁斥责美帝国主义为绞杀俄国自由的屠夫和凶手，是西欧的宪兵。
    列宁说：“事实表明，英国和美国在充当摧残俄国自由的屠夫和宪兵，它们所用的方式和俄国屠夫尼古拉一世统治时一样，而且并不亚于绞杀匈牙利革命的屠夫们。这一个角色目前已由威尔逊的代理人担任起来了。他们在窒息奥地利的革命，他们在扮演宪兵的脚色，他们向瑞士提出了最后通牒说：假如你们不参加反布尔什维克政府的斗争，我们便不给你们粮食。他们对荷兰说：不要让苏维埃大使入境，否则我们便要加以封锁。他们的武器非常简单——饥饿的绞索。这就是他们绞杀他国的武器。”（列宁全集，第二十八卷，第一八八页）
  列宁论美帝国主义走向德帝国主义同样的结局
    列宁指出：美帝国主义者虽然有“民主”的假面具，但并不比兽性的德国帝国主义好些，它也和德国帝国主义一样在走向同样可耻的结局。
    列宁一九一八年在全俄苏维埃第六次临时代表大会上说：“我们看到，英国和美国本来是有更大的机会继续保持为民主共和国的，可是现在却变得和德国在得意的时候那样野蛮和骄横了，因此它们也会同样迅速地，甚至更加迅速地走到同样的结局，像德国帝国主义那样圆满地达到的结局。德国帝国主义起初是惊人地膨胀，一直到囊括整个欧洲的四分之三，它长肥了，可是突然之间它爆裂了，剩下了一股可怕的臭味。英国和美国帝国主义目前迅速奔赴的也就是这样一个结局。”（列宁全集，俄文版第二十八卷，第一三八页）。
    列宁指出：德国帝国主义在一九一八年充当杀害俄罗斯和乌克兰革命工农的凶手，它就这样掘下了自己的坟墓：本来纪律森严的德国军队变为军心涣散了。
    列宁预言说：“当英美帝国主义进行那种要把它们自己引到政治崩溃的冒险的时候，当它们命令它们的军队充当镇压整个欧洲的凶手和宪兵的时候，它们也将掘下自己的坟墓。”（列宁全集，俄文版第二十八卷，第一四一页）。
    列宁的这些话对于美国统治集团的恣意横行的政治疯子们来说是一个严厉的警告，他们怀着获取世界霸权的欲望正以如此疯狂的速度把美国人民驱进新的第三次世界大战的深渊。
    现在，既不了解世界历史，也没有从历史中取得教训的美帝国主义，正在亦步亦趋地追随着纳粹帝国主义所走过的足迹。在这个时候，列宁的预言便有了特别强大的力量。
    列宁教导我们说：“英美帝国主义和德国帝国主义同样是野兽。”他揭露英美帝国主义者旨在镇压及压迫俄国及西欧人民的计划和行动说：“他们力图压服从资本主义走向自由的人民，他们力图扼杀革命。我们可以非常肯定地说：这只贪馋的野兽现在就要重蹈德国帝国主义野兽的复辙而堕入深渊中去了”（列宁全集，俄文版，第二十八卷，第十四页）。
  列宁论苏联在胜利中日益强大
    外国武装干涉苏维埃俄罗斯的一切企图的破产，是劳动人民对国际帝国主义的一次最大的胜利。年青的苏维埃共和国战胜了无数股的敌人，这一伟大胜利证实了伟大的十月社会主义革命是合乎历史法则的。这次革命开创了人类历史的新纪元。
    一九二○年十月，列宁谈到国际帝国主义武装干涉失败的无比重大意义时曾预言说：“从一切参预国际政治的国家的行动中，我们获得的一个伟大的客观教训就是：我们的事业是根深蒂固的，尽管有人企图侵略俄国和对俄国发动战争——这样的企图无疑地是会有的，而且还不止一次呢——可是，我们已经被经验锻炼得坚强了，我们已经从实际经验中知道：所有这些企图终将一败涂地。经过我们敌人的每一次进攻，我们都会变得更为强大”（列宁全集，第三十一卷，第三○四页）。
    历史已经证实了列宁的天才的预言。当一九四一年美国垄断企业所哺育与喂养的纳粹帝国主义背信弃义地进攻苏联的时候，社会主义国家在伟大的领袖和战略家斯大林同志的英明指导下，击败了希特勒德国并且在经过这次空前严酷的斗争后，变得比一九四一年以前更强大了（经久不息的掌声）。
    今天，即使我们最恶毒的敌人也不得不承认这个无可争辩的历史事实。即使像美国参议员塔夫脱这样卑鄙的反动派也不得不承认：美国侵略者们所怀抱的以地面部队在欧洲大陆上与俄国作战的计划是注定要失败的，这是“一种办不到的侵略，拿破仑与希特勒在花了代价之后懂得了这一点”（一九五一年一月八日真理报）。
    在击败了外国军事干涉后，列宁教我们牢记：我们的政策的第一诫条就是“经常戒备，记住我们是被那些公开表示对我们仇恨最深的那些人、那些阶级与政府包围着的。我们必须记住，我们随时有遭到侵犯的危险。我们将尽我们的一切力量来避免这个灾祸”（列宁全集，俄文版，第三十三卷，第一二二页）。
  列宁论美帝国主义的野蛮兽性
    列宁在分析第一次世界大战后的国际形势时说：美帝国主义者在这次战争中已经发了大财，窃得了浩大的财富，已经变得空前的骄横，甚至更加厚颜无耻地干涉他国的事务。列宁在他的致美国工人书中说：“美国的富豪也许是世界上最富有的，他们的地理位置也许是最安全的。他们使自己比任何其他人都富有。他们使所有的国家，甚至最富有的国家，成为他们的纳贡者。他们盗窃了千百亿美元。在每一块美元上都有着一块“有利可图的”军事订货合同的污斑。这种军事订货合同在每一个国家都使得富者愈富而贫者愈贫了。在每一块美元上都有着血迹——一千万被杀死的与二千万被弄成残废的人们所流的血海的痕迹”（列宁全集，俄文版，第二十八卷，第四十六页）。
    列宁证明：早在一九一八年，英美帝国主义即已在夺取世界霸权了。
    列宁说：“英美帝国主义比以前更加厚颜无耻了，而且以为自己是无人可以反抗的太上皇。”（列宁全集，俄文版，第二十八卷，第三五三页）列宁列举了许多实例说明：任何地方的资本统治都不像美国的资本统治那样骄横、无耻而野蛮，尽管他们高谈什么民主与全体公民平等。
    列宁一再促使大家注意美国的帝国主义统治者在一九一七——一九二○年即已在培养着的狰狞而野蛮的本能，以及他们用何等的残暴来迫害革命工人，甚至迫害仅是拥护和平的人。
    一九一八年列宁在普列斯尼亚区的工人代表会议上说：“威尔逊是世界上最民主的共和国的总统。而他说些什么呢？在那个国家，沙文主义的暴徒们在街上枪杀人民，仅仅是因为这些人民为和平说了一句话。一个从未参加革命的教士仅仅因为宣讲了和平竟被拖到街上打得血肉模糊”（列宁全集，俄文版，第二十八卷，第三三七页）。
    列宁所指的是和平拥护者比奇洛教士，他“被二十个戴着假面具和黑头巾的人用皮鞭笞挞。他们很熟练地，很有节拍地抽打他（一个目击者——纽约时报记者叙述了这件事）。比奇洛痛得弯下身子，最后倒下了。当他躺在地上的时候，他们仍抽打他，总计他们约打了他二千皮鞭，鲜血与涂在这位不幸的人身上的柏油混在一起。当他们沿着行人道把他拖回家的时候，没有人能说他们拖着的是一个活人还是一个死人。”
    然而这个私刑法律下的牺牲者侥幸没有死。比奇洛迳赴华盛顿去见总统，向他控诉。但是结果却出乎意外。两星期后比奇洛本人反而被交付审判，罪名是“不爱国和公开同情非战分子”（实际上是和平拥护者）。
    在这次可耻的事件发生后一个星期，“世界产业工人”的十七个会员也遭遇到和比奇洛一样的野蛮待遇；他们当中有三个人第二天便死去了。
    这就是美帝国主义的风度，这就是“美国生活方式”！
    列宁在谈到美帝国主义可恶的兽性和傲慢时说：
    “在这里我们看到一个完全赤裸裸的帝国主义，它甚至认为没有必要将它的赤裸裸的原形稍加掩盖，认为它现在这样是再好不过了”（列宁全集，第三十一卷，第四一六页）。
    列宁甚至在当时二十世纪二十年代就指出：美帝国主义的掠夺政策正在引起各国人民日益增长的仇恨。
    一九二○年十二月，列宁在俄国共产党莫斯科组织的干部会议上说：“美国是强的，他们都欠它的钱，每件事都取决于它，但是他们都变得愈来愈仇恨它，它抢劫了每一个人。资产阶级的全部出版物证实了这种对美国的日益增长的仇恨”（列宁全集，第三十一卷，第四一九、四二○页）。
  列宁论苏俄对和平的坚定不渝
    在这些关于外交政策的言论中，列宁总是强调苏俄对和平的坚定不渝的期望。
    列宁对美国报纸纽约晚报记者所询问题的回答（一九二○年二月）具有非常的重要性。这篇答记者问第一次发表在列宁全集的第四版。
    记者问：“与美国和平的基础是什么？”
    列宁答道：“美国资本家别管我们的事，我们也不管他们的事。我们甚至准备用黄金向他们交换机器、工具之类对运输和生产有用的东西，而且不但用黄金，还用原料。”
    在回答“对这样的和平的障碍是什么？”这一问题时，列宁说：
    “我们这方面是没有的，障碍在美国（以及一切其他国家）的资本家方面，这就是帝国主义”（列宁全集，俄文版，第三十卷，第三四○页）。
  中朝人民给了侵略者毁灭性的打击
    列宁屡次提到的美帝国主义的掠夺抢劫的性质，它的想要称霸世界和奴役亚欧两洲的野心——美帝国主义的这些特点自第二次世界大战以来特别有力地表现出来了。由于希图统治世界，美英帝国主义者已经对东方各国人民发动了血腥的殖民战争。美国军队正在爱好和平爱好自由的朝鲜人民的国土上施行史无前例的暴行。朝鲜人民正在以极大的勇敢和英雄主义抵抗美国侵略者，并和中国人民志愿军一道正在给侵略者以毁灭性的打击。
    美帝国主义者在开始对朝鲜进行罪恶的武装干涉的时候，原想靠大规模轰炸和可怖的暴行来吓倒英雄的朝鲜人民，并迫使他们屈膝。但事实证明完全不是那么一回事。尽管他们在武器方面占有巨大优势，尽管他们动员了大量的海空军，美国军队在朝鲜仍然遭受了前所未有的军事惨败。许多不久以前还相信“威力”、甚至相信美帝国主义“必胜”的人们，现在也开始三思了。美国的军事威望在欧洲及亚洲许多人的心目中已受到了严重的损害。另一方面，美国强盗从希特勒匪帮那里学来的那种焚烧朝鲜的繁荣城市和村庄，使它们变为“沙漠区”的野蛮政策，已使美帝国主义受到欧洲人民的强烈的憎恨，而亚洲人民则憎恨得更为厉害。
    正如过去对苏联的干涉遭受惨败一样，美国今天也正在朝鲜遭受惨败。无容怀疑，美帝国主义者图谋称霸世界的愚蠢计划，将以彻底的失败结束。
    战争与帝国主义反动势力受到了以伟大苏联——国际和平与友好的不可动摇的堡垒——为首的强大而日益增长的和平、民主与社会主义力量的对抗。
  列宁主义是人类解放的战无不胜的旗帜
    列宁教导我们说：根据活生生的历史经验所证实的历史规律，我们的伟大的事业，劳动人民从资本主义奴隶制度下解放的事业，是不可战胜的！列宁的不朽的名言鼓舞着人们对于共产主义事业不可战胜的最高的信心。不论帝国主义资产阶级会野蛮到如何程度，不论他们使工人阶级先进的自觉的斗士——共产党人，甚至普通的和平战士遭受到何等凶恶的迫害，但是，未来仍然是属于我们这个时代的先进思想的，任何“世界警察”（我们知道，美国正以此自任）都无法把这些思想关在铁窗后面（鼓掌）。
    伟大的列宁——斯大林主义的国际平等与友好的思想，争取世界持久和平的斗争正在取得并且将要取得新的最高的胜利（鼓掌）。
    列宁在他的名著“共产主义运动中的‘左派’幼稚病”一书中说：
    “尽管资产阶级东奔西撞，凶狂暴戾，肆意横行，做出许多蠢事，预先报复布尔什维克，并尽情屠杀（在印度、匈牙利、德意志等国）几百、几千、几十万个明天或昨天的布尔什维克：尽管资产阶级这样横行无忌吧，但它的命运总是和以前被历史判处了死刑的一切阶级底命运一样。共产主义者应当知道，将来的世界无论如何都是属于他们的，因此我们能够（而且应当）既在大革命的斗争中表现极大的热情，同时又能用最冷静和最清醒的头脑去估量资产阶级疯狂莽撞的行动”（列宁全集，俄文版第三十一卷，第八十一页）。
    同志们！我们是在二十世纪的上半世纪刚刚结束的时候纪念列宁逝世二十七周年的。在过去的半个世纪中，马克思——列宁主义的思想曾取得了最伟大的胜利。在这种思想的旗帜下，在继续列宁的事业的天才——斯大林同志领导下，苏维埃人民已经建设了社会主义并且正在胜利地建设一个共产主义社会。在列宁主义的思想的旗帜下，世界的工人运动与民族解放运动已经发展了，而且正在继续发展，争取和平、民主与社会主义的斗争已经进行并且正在继续进行。
    领导我们向共产主义迈进的列宁与斯大林的英明的党万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
    全人类解放的战无不胜的旗帜——列宁主义万岁！（历久不息的暴风雨般的掌声。参加纪念大会的人们全体起立，唱党歌“国际歌”。）
