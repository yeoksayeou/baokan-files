Xinhua News Agency, January 6th: TASS, Pyongyang, January 5th: Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, issued an order on the 5th stating:

　　After the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers jointly launched a powerful offensive, they liberated our capital, Seoul, on January 4, 1951. Our army's liberation of Seoul is a victory of great political significance. The American imperialists' plan to occupy our capital, Seoul, has failed. The American imperialist troops inflicted great damage on our capital, Seoul, during their retreat. They massacred many Korean patriots who bravely fought against the American aggressors. Considering the losses suffered by our people in the struggle against the American barbarians, the fact that many of our cities and villages have been razed to the ground by the American aggressors, and the damage inflicted by the aggressors on Seoul, the political and cultural center of our motherland, it is the responsibility of all patriotic elements of the Korean people, commanders and combatants of the People's Army, and male and female guerrillas to continue the selfless and heroic struggle against the American aggressors. Brave commanders and combatants of our army! Male and female guerrillas! Glorious Chinese People's Volunteer Army troops! Pursue the enemy relentlessly, surround and annihilate the enemy's forces, giving them no respite day or night. Encircle the enemy, cut off their communications, and destroy the enemy's manpower and equipment. Liberate the Korean people from the shackles of American imperialism, so that the final victory of the Korean people's struggle against foreign aggressors may come sooner. Make the American imperialists realize that now is the time for them to get out of Korea! On the occasion of this victory of the liberation of Seoul, I want to thank all the soldiers who have made special contributions in the battle to liberate Seoul. The Korean people express their greatest gratitude to the Chinese People's Volunteers for their heroic support in the struggle against American armed aggression.

　　In order to commemorate this victory, I order: Today—January 5th at 20:00 (Pyongyang time), a 24-gun salute will be fired from 240 cannons in both Pyongyang and Seoul to celebrate.

　　Eternal glory to the commanders, combatants, and male and female guerrillas who sacrificed themselves in the battle for the freedom and independence of our motherland!

　　金日成发布命令庆祝汉城解放
    平壤汉城两地鸣炮二十四响祝捷
    【新华社六日讯】塔斯社平壤五日讯：朝鲜人民军总司令金日成于五日发布命令称：
    朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军协同发动了强大的攻势后，已在一九五一年一月四日解放我国首都汉城。我军解放汉城是具有重大政治意义的胜利。美帝国主义者想盘据我们首都汉城的计划已告失败。美帝国主义者的军队在退却的时候，对我们的首都汉城作了极大的破坏。他们屠杀了许多为反抗美国侵略者而英勇斗争的朝鲜爱国志士。鉴于我国人民在反抗美国野蛮人的斗争中所受的损失，我们的许多城市与乡村被美国侵略者夷为平地，侵略者对我们祖国的政治与文化中心——汉城所加的破坏，所有朝鲜人民的爱国分子、人民军的指挥员、战斗员以及男女游击队员的责任，就是对美国侵略者继续进行忘我的英勇斗争。英勇的我军指挥员、战斗员！男女游击队员！光荣的中国人民志愿军部队！要不停地追击敌人，包围和消灭敌军的部队，使敌人日夜不得喘息。包围敌人，切断敌人的交通，消灭敌军的人力与装备。把朝鲜人民从美帝国主义者的枷锁下解放出来，使得朝鲜人民反抗外国侵略者的斗争的最后胜利，更快地到来。要使美帝国主义者认识：现在是他们从朝鲜滚出去的时候了！在这个解放汉城的胜利的时候，我要感谢那些在解放汉城的战斗中有特殊功绩的所有的战士们。朝鲜人民对于在反抗美国武装侵略者的斗争中给我们以英勇支援的中国人民志愿军表示极大的感谢。
    为了纪念这次的胜利，我命令：今天——一月五日二十时（平壤时间）在平壤与汉城两地以二百四十门大炮鸣放二十四响，进行庆祝。
    在争取我们祖国的自由与独立的战斗中牺牲的指挥员、战斗员与男女游击队员们永垂不朽！
