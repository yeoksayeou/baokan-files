Xinhua News Agency, Dihua, 13th: Anthony Heurtley, a British national (formerly British Consul in Dihua), who colluded with American spy, Mackinnon, to engage in espionage and anti-People's Government activities in Xinjiang, was deported by our People's Public Security organs on December 16th of last year. Since Heurtley arrived in Dihua in 1948, he had been in cahoots with the American spy Mackinnon, jointly engaging in espionage activities against the Chinese people. After the peaceful liberation of Xinjiang, Heurtley continued to use the name of the British consulate to issue passports to five Kuomintang secret agents who had committed heinous crimes, including Ma Chengxiang (former commander of the 5th Cavalry Army stationed in Xinjiang and Qinghai), allowing them to flee to India. He also provided Mackinnon, who was fleeing from justice, with US$1,500. Before fleeing, Mackinnon transferred all kinds of important intelligence, materials, two radio stations, 97 blocks of yellow explosives, 7,000 rounds of ammunition, and other equipment to Heurtley. After the People's Liberation Army entered Xinjiang, Heurtley's espionage activities shifted from overt to covert, using missionary work and providing medical treatment and medicine as a cover to recruit reactionary elements, spread reactionary remarks that slandered the Communist Party and the People's Government, and insulted and slandered our public security personnel. The Public Security organs of the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government repeatedly warned Heurtley that he must immediately cease his activities undermining the new China. After being warned, Heurtley made a written guarantee to the People's Government Public Security organs that he would cease his espionage activities and admitted his mistakes. However, after the American imperialists launched the war of aggression against Korea, Heurtley openly engaged in the aforementioned activities against the Chinese people. In order to safeguard the interests of the country and the people, our People's Public Security organs inspected Heurtley's residence on December 4th, and as a result, uncovered various pieces of evidence of espionage crimes, including 76 pieces of information related to the Yili revolution, one report each on Xinjiang's mineral and agricultural and pastoral surveys, and 10 pieces of materials on Mackinnon's collusion with the bandit Usmn, two boxes of various bullets, 59 vacuum tubes used for transmitting and receiving radios, two 500-watt generators, and various other telecommunications equipment. In addition, two radios that had been sealed by the People's Government and could be used for transmitting and receiving were discovered, as well as many pieces of important intelligence that had been hidden by Heurtley when the Public Security organs confiscated materials from the US consulate. Heurtley confessed in writing on the spot that the above-mentioned criminal facts were undeniable, and signed his name on the confiscated intelligence materials.

　　英国侨民何仁志在新疆从事间谍活动被我查获后驱逐出境
    【新华社迪化十三日电】勾结美国间谍马克南在新疆从事间谍及反人民政府活动的英侨何仁志（前英国驻迪化领事馆领事），已于去年十二月十六日被我人民公安机关驱逐出境。何仁志自一九四八年来迪后，即与美国间谍马克南狼狈为奸，共同从事反对中国人民的间谍活动。新疆和平解放后，何仁志仍以英领事馆名义，发护照给罪大恶极的国民党特务马呈祥（原驻新、青，匪骑五军长）等五人，让他们逃往印度，并以美金一千五百元接济畏罪逃跑的马克南。马克南在逃跑前则将各种重要情报、材料、电台两部、黄色炸药九十七块、弹药七千发以及其他用具统移交给何仁志。解放军进驻新疆后，何仁志的间谍活动由公开转为秘密，利用传教名义和施医赠药等方法，罗致反动分子，散布诬蔑共产党和人民政府的反动言论，辱骂和诬蔑我公安工作人员。新疆省人民政府公安机关曾一再警告何仁志必须立即停止他的破坏新中国的活动。何仁志在受到警告后，曾向人民政府公安机关具结保证停止间谍活动，并承认错误。但在美帝国主义发动侵略朝鲜战争后，何仁志又公开地进行上述反对中国人民的活动。我人民公安机关为维护国家和人民利益，遂于十二月四日将何仁志住宅加以检查，结果查获间谍犯罪证据多种，计有有关伊犁革命情报七十六件，新疆矿产、农牧调查报告各一件，及马克南勾结乌斯满匪徒材料十件，各种子弹两箱，收发报机所用之真空管五十九个，五百瓦发电机两部，以及其他电讯器材多种。此外，并查获已由人民政府明令查封可作收发报用的收音机两部，以及公安机关没收美领事馆物资时被何仁志隐藏的重要情报多件。上述犯罪事实，均经何仁志当场书面具结承认不讳，并在没收的情报材料上签了名。
