　　Material Exchange Work in North China
    Li Ping
    Last year, North China generally experienced bumper harvests. Farmers urgently need to sell surplus agricultural and sideline products in order to exchange them for means of production and means of livelihood. According to statistics from Chahar Province for fourteen types of agricultural and sideline products, the products needing to be exported are valued at approximately 280 billion yuan. Shanxi Province needs to export 400 million jin of surplus grain, over 45 million jin of cotton, and over 100 million jin of oilseeds, hemp, native produce, and medicinal materials this winter. The province needs to exchange for at least 250,000 bolts of cloth in the fourth quarter of 1950 alone. Therefore, how to ensure that farmers' surplus grain, cotton, local products, and other agricultural and sideline products can be sold smoothly, and that industrial products can flow steadily to rural markets, developing material exchange between urban and rural areas and between regions, has become a major issue of great concern to millions of people.
            (I)
    Developing urban-rural material exchange in North China enjoys relatively favorable conditions. This is because, after land reform throughout the region and two or three major production campaigns, the rural economy has rapidly recovered and developed; after adjustments, industry and commerce have also become increasingly active; state-owned trading organizations in major regions have gradually been established and improved; and cooperatives have a broad foundation. Under these conditions, material exchange needs to be carried out through the following three forms: (1) Purchases and sales by state-owned trade organizations; (2) Purchases and sales by cooperatives; (3) Purchases and sales by private merchants.
    Among these three main forms, state-owned trade organizations play a leading role. State-owned trade organizations should correctly combine and utilize various economic forces, organize the power of cooperatives and private capital, and make every effort to develop material exchange. Facts have proven that last year, under the new situation, state-owned trade organizations and cooperatives in various parts of North China created many methods to reduce currency circulation and promote urban-rural material exchange. These methods have proven successful.
    In terms of procurement, methods such as credit purchases, barter, and pre-ordering have ensured the planned exchange of industrial and agricultural products.
    1. Credit Purchases: Farmers sell agricultural and sideline products to state-owned trading companies or cooperatives on credit, and state-owned trading companies and cooperatives periodically repay farmers with currency or in kind. For example, the Huasha Cloth Company in Puyang Chengguan District, Pingyuan, purchases cotton from farmers on credit, issues formal transaction receipts, and farmers can withdraw money upon presentation of the receipts when due. The term can be long or short, and interest and preferential treatment are given according to the length of time. When pricing credit purchases, those priced in kind receive the actual goods when due, and those priced in currency receive payment when due, benefiting from price increases but not suffering from price decreases. Yongnian, Hebei, adopts a combination of credit purchases and in-kind deposits, guaranteeing principal and value without interest or guaranteeing principal with interest but not guaranteeing value. Some regions adopt the method of in-kind deposits in lieu of taxes, delivering cotton to the cooperative, which pays public grain on behalf of the farmer. This method has won the support of the masses.
    2. Barter: Farmers sell products to state-owned trading companies or cooperatives and exchange them for daily necessities. For example, the Huasha Cloth Company in Puyang Chengguan District, Pingyuan, issues temporary cotton sale receipts after cotton farmers sell cotton. Farmers can use the receipts to exchange and withdraw goods from other sister companies, and have priority in purchasing goods.
    3. Pre-ordering: When the supply of goods in rural markets in some areas of Hebei cannot meet demand, farmers pay for goods in advance to trade companies or cooperatives and receive the goods periodically. Anyang Prefecture in Pingyuan extensively carries out advance ordering, such as grain companies and cooperative warehouses pre-ordering 85,000 reed mats from Ye County.
    In terms of promotion and revitalizing rural funds, methods such as credit sales, consignment sales, and credit have been adopted to enable the large-scale exchange of materials in various places and the appropriate activation of rural funds.
    1. Credit Sales: For certain goods, trade companies and cooperatives sell them on credit. For example, Anguo County in Hebei implemented credit sales of medicinal materials, resulting in a 150 percent increase in sales.
    2. Consignment Sales: Trade companies and trade companies, trade companies and cooperatives, and cooperatives and cooperatives sign contracts to sell goods on consignment. For example, Qingyuan dried grapes in Shanxi are sold on consignment in Beijing and Tianjin, and Qinyang writing brushes in Pingyuan are sold on consignment in Hebei and Shanxi. Often, goods that are slow-moving in one place become popular and easy to sell in another.
    3. Credit: Generally, a credit department is established within rural supply and marketing cooperatives to absorb idle rural funds and invest them in rural production and sales. When depositing, there are distinctions between in-kind deposits and currency deposits, inflation-adjusted and non-inflation-adjusted, long-term and short-term, with interest paid periodically. Loans are also divided into long-term and short-term, with different interest rates. This rural cooperative credit method is very popular among farmers and is called "Fangzhangpu" (lending shops).
    The above purchases, sales, and credit operations prove that they can all promote material exchange, making it easier for farmers to exchange what they have for what they lack, and providing convenience. Furthermore, with the expansion of business, trade companies and cooperatives, especially cooperatives, can expand their scope of operations and consolidate their foundations.
    Secondly, it is necessary to organize private merchants to go to the countryside for purchases. Organizing private merchants to go to the countryside for purchases requires arduous organizational work. This requires state-owned trade organizations and cooperatives to use substantial strength to unite private merchants through contract systems. Under the principle of voluntary mutual benefit, they should provide practical guidance for them to purchase industrial and agricultural products. They should also appropriately resolve the difficulties of private merchants, such as providing appropriate care or reductions in prices, transportation, taxes, and procedures to make it profitable for them. On the other hand, it is necessary to strengthen leadership and education to implement the principle of small profits and quick sales; ensure specifications, serve the countryside, and strictly prevent speculative commercial activities.
    Experience has proven that an effective way to organize private merchants to operate in the countryside is to organize joint operations. Joint operation methods include joint purchase and sale, joint purchase and separate sale, and several other types. The advantage of this method is that it concentrates funds, saves manpower, and expands business. Joint operations can be divided into two types: joint operations between public and private entities, and joint operations between private entities. However, both types of joint operations cannot be separated from the organization and leadership of the state-owned economy. Most merchants require joint operations with public entities to overcome difficulties such as insufficient funds and credit. The results of correctly organizing joint operations in various places have been significant. In Wuxiang, Shanxi, the cooperative and merchants jointly operated for fifty days, exporting more than 130,000 jin of grain, and over 1 billion yuan worth of eggs, wool, oil, pears, and dangshen, exchanging for more than 80,000 jin of cotton, more than 110,000 jin of edible salt, and nearly 600 bolts of foreign cloth, with private merchants operating more than half of the business. At the beginning of joint operations, some merchants have concerns. For example, Shijiazhuang City organized ten freight forwarding firms to raise 500,000 yuan for joint operations. At the beginning, it was only for three months, and the method of withdrawing shares midway was agreed upon. Now, they have engaged in large-scale operations, and their business has reached Hankou. This shows that when the benefits of joint operations are proven in practice, concerns will be eliminated.
    While organizing merchants to jointly operate and purchase in the countryside, they should also be encouraged to bring goods to the countryside for sale. For example, Xingtai and Shijiazhuang in Hebei proposed "local product merchants bringing industrial products to the countryside," which is beneficial to industrial production and supplying the needs of farmers, especially in mountainous areas where the supply of materials is insufficient. Moreover, bringing goods to the countryside for purchase not only realizes the exchange of materials but also increases commercial profits, which private merchants can achieve. As the operating profits of merchants increase, their enthusiasm for operation will also increase.
    In addition, to ensure the smooth exchange of materials between regions, it is also necessary to organize private merchants to contact merchants from other places as much as possible, which is very helpful for expanding sales channels. Cang County in Hebei mobilized private merchants to contact merchants from other places to come for purchases by writing letters and sending people. As a result, forty merchants from Shanghai, Tianjin, Wuxi, and other places came to buy goods. The Xuanhua City Federation of Industry and Commerce and the Industry and Commerce Section of the Municipal People's Government organized a trade delegation of private industry and commerce to visit various places. As a result, they signed business contracts with relevant industries in Suiyuan, Baotou, Longguan, Chicheng, and other places, solving a part of the purchase and sale problems.
    It should be emphasized that the contract system plays an important linking role in the implementation of the above various business methods and organizational forms. The reasonable signing of various types of contracts between state-owned trade organizations, cooperatives, private merchants, and individual farmers under the conditions of voluntary mutual benefit has become an important key in organizing material exchange. However, it should be noted that after the contract is signed, credit must be observed and strictly implemented. Timely inspection and mutual supervision are the keys to ensuring the implementation of the business plan and the realization of the contract as scheduled. The signing of the contract should be based on the principle of being specific and clear. Those who do not act in accordance with the contract and do not keep their promises must be given due punishment. In this way, the contract system can play a huge role in ensuring material exchange.
            (II)
    Developing material exchange between urban and rural areas and between regions is a very important task. This work has a great impact on the national economy and the people's livelihood, and governments at all levels and party leading organs must pay enough attention to it, personally take action, come up with methods, and specifically organize and promote it in order to achieve better results.
    Some government and party leading cadres underestimate trade work, adopt a laissez-faire attitude, and the idea of not wanting to "do business" must be corrected. We must strengthen the work of leading the exchange of materials, and we must learn to do business. Some cadres in prefectures and counties only emphasize leading production and neglect trade work. This is because they do not understand that selling farmers' surplus products and exchanging them for the means of production and livelihood that farmers urgently need is a necessary condition for doing a good job in production and an important link in promoting the Great Production Movement.
    Under the attention of leading cadres, Wei County in Chahar recently held a local product conference, convening representatives from the chairmen and secretaries of the Federations of Industry and Commerce in all eight towns of the county, state-owned companies, supply and marketing cooperatives, banks, etc., and invited local and foreign private merchants to participate. Responsible cadres of the county personally presided over the meeting, and the industrial and commercial administrative departments reported on the government's incentive policies in terms of lending, taxation, local product prices, large truck freight, and market management, enabling private merchants to have a better understanding of the "prospects of prices" and "sales channels for products," and to feel that operating local products "has both fame and profit," which increased their confidence. After discussions by region and industry at the meeting, the experience of merchants was combined with the government's investigations, enabling all cadres to understand the situation of local products, understand the importance of operating local products, and have a "bottom line" in organizing commercial forces, stipulating and grasping commercial plans, and public-private cooperation, which greatly promoted material exchange.
    There are many ways to exchange materials, so it is necessary to discover and create avenues in many ways. For example, close business and commercial contacts between regions and towns, and regular exchange of information on production, sales, supply, and demand can serve as preparation for further concluding purchase and sales contracts. For example, various forms of market fairs, temple fairs, local product conferences, and production exhibitions can also help establish relationships in various aspects, sign contracts, and find outlets. The work of material exchange is planned and led. Therefore, it is necessary to closely combine administrative organs, state-owned companies, banks, cooperatives, private merchants, and individual farmers from top to bottom, and uniformly lead, accurately grasp the overall situation, make comprehensive considerations, and formulate plans, and then work hard to carry out the plans as a whole. State-owned trade organizations and cooperatives should lead private merchants to jointly improve technology, calculate carefully, make products meet specifications, ensure quality, and allocate them according to actual needs. In terms of prices, price policies should be grasped correctly and reasonably so that production, transportation, and sales can all obtain legitimate benefits. In view of the complexity and importance of material exchange work, some regions have established specialized institutions to strengthen leadership. For example, the Yanbei Prefecture and Datong City in Chahar Province have established urban-rural economic management committees; Xing County in Shanxi has formed a material exchange management committee. As long as the local leading organs attach importance to these specialized institutions and personally take responsibility, they may not become a mere formality and will be beneficial to unified leadership and multi-faceted communication of material exchange.
    Finally, restoring old and destroyed trade networks, actively establishing new trade networks, and vigorously organizing transportation work are also important links in developing material exchange. Paying attention to restoring and establishing freight yards and inns in small and medium-sized cities and towns, and improving the management and operation of existing freight yards and inns to facilitate merchants and farmers entering the city, has become an important task in promoting material exchange. Before the war, Wuzhi and Yangcheng in Pingyuan Province had 39 Huai freight yards, but now only five remain. In some areas of Xinxiang, because there were no bamboo freight yards, foreign merchants could not purchase goods after arriving locally last year, while local producers had nowhere to sell them, which also illustrates the importance of establishing commercial networks. As for transportation work, it is an issue that cannot be neglected in the circulation of materials. In addition to railways, highways, and waterways playing as large a role as possible within the scope of their capabilities, establishing intermodal transport relationships, and accelerating the turnover of goods, it is also necessary to repair other necessary transportation routes, rationally organize all usable means of transportation and transportation forces to engage in transportation. For example, Tong County Prefecture in Hebei Province plans to organize 3,500 rubber-wheeled carts, handcarts, and pack animal vendors to transport goods this winter; Linfen Prefecture in Shanxi Province is preparing to repair 15 highways and mobilize 70 percent of livestock and ox carts to participate in transportation; some regions have organized transportation cooperatives or cooperatives have organized transportation teams to carry out transportation work. Providing assistance and encouragement for this, and widely mobilizing and organizing, providing convenience and ensuring the safety of their journeys along the way to enhance their enthusiasm, will greatly benefit the timely transportation of materials.

　　华北地区的物资交流工作
    力平
    华北各地去年普遍丰收，农民迫切需要出售剩余农副业产品，以换取生产资料和生活资料。据察哈尔省十四种农副业产品统计，需输出的产品约值二千八百余亿元。山西今冬需输出余粮四亿斤，棉花四千五百余万斤，油料、麻皮、山货药材等一亿余斤，全省需要换回布匹仅一九五○年第四季度即达二十五万余匹。因此，如何使得农民的余粮、棉花、土产等农副业产品能够畅销，工业品能够源源流到农村市场，开展城乡与地区间的物资交流，已成为当前千百万人民所极为关心的重大问题。
            （一）
    开展城乡物资交流工作，在华北来说，是具有比较良好的条件的。这是由于全区土地改革后经过两三个大生产运动，农村经济已迅速恢复和发展；工商业经过调整后，亦已日趋活跃；各主要地区的国营贸易机构都已逐渐建立和健全；合作社也已有广泛的基础，在此条件下，就需通过下列三种形式开展物资交流：（一）国营贸易机关的购销；（二）合作社的购销；（三）私营商贩的购销。
    在这三种主要形式中，国营贸易机关是起着领导作用的。国营贸易机关应该正确地结合和运用各种经济力量，组织合作社和私人资本的力量，以全力来开展物资交流。事实证明，去年华北各地国营贸易机关和合作社在新的形势下，为减少货币投放，促进城乡物资交流，是创造了不少的办法。这些办法经事实证明是成功的。
    在收购方面，用赊购、换购、订购等办法，保证了工农业产品的有计划的交流。
    一、赊购：农民以赊账方式把农副产品卖给国营贸易公司或合作社，国营贸易公司和合作社则定期偿付农民以货币或实物。如平原濮阳城关区花纱布公司赊购农民棉花，开给正式成交收据，到期农民凭据取款，期限有长有短，按照时间长短，分别给以利息和优待。在赊购计价时，按实物计价者到期提取实物，按货币计价者到期取款，听涨不听落。河北永年采取赊购和存实相结合的方式，保本保值不计息或保本计息不保值。有的地区采取存实代征方式，向合作社交棉，由合作社代交公粮。这种办法，取得了群众的拥护。
    二、换购：农民向国营贸易公司或合作社售出产品，换取日用必需品。如平原濮阳城关区花纱布公司，在棉农售棉后，开给临时售棉收据，棉农凭据即可到其他兄弟公司换购提取货物，并有购货优先权等。
    三、订购：河北有些地区集市物资供不应求时，农民向贸易公司或合作社交款订货，定期给货。平原安阳专区则广泛开展预购订货，如粮食公司、合作货栈等单位共定购邺县八万五千领苇席。
    在推销和活跃农村资金方面，则采用了赊销、代销，以及信贷等办法，使各地物资得以大量交流，农村资金得以适当活泼。
    一、赊销：对若干货物，贸易公司和合作社以赊账方式售出。如河北安国县实行药材赊销，结果销量增加百分之一百五十。
    二、代销：贸易公司和贸易公司、贸易公司和合作社、合作社与合作社间签订合同，代为销售。如山西的清源葡萄干在京、津代销，平原的沁阳毛笔在河北、山西代销等，往往此地是冷货，运至他处即为热货，易于出售。
    三、信贷：一般均为农村供销社内设信贷股，以吸收农村的游资，投向农村产销事业。存款时分存实及存款，折实不折实，长期和短期等区别，按期付息，贷款亦分长期短期，利息不同。这种农村合作信贷办法，甚为农民欢迎，称为“放账铺”。
    以上购销和信贷业务的进行，证明了都能促进物资交流，使农民以有易无，得到便利。并且随着业务的开展，可使贸易公司和合作社特别是合作社经营范围日益扩大，基础更加巩固。
    其次是要组织私商下乡收购。要使私营商贩组织起来下乡收购，是需要经过一番艰巨的组织工作的。这就需要国营贸易机关和合作社以相当力量通过合同制度来团结私商。在自愿互利原则下，切实指导他们去收购工农业产品。并适当解决私商的困难，例如在价格、运输、税收、手续上予以适当的照顾或减免，使他们有利可图。另一方面，则要加强领导和教育，以贯彻薄利广销的方针；保证规格，面向农村，并严格制止投机商业的活动。
    经验证明，组织私商下乡经营的有效方式，是组织起来联合经营。联营的方式有联购联销、联购分销等数种。这一方式的优点，在于集中资金，节省人力，扩大业务。联营可以分公与私联营和私与私联营两种类型，但两种联营都不能离开国营经济的组织和领导。大部分商人都要求和公家联营，以克服资金和信用等不足的困难。各地正确组织联营的结果成绩很大。山西武乡合作社和商人联营五十天，共输出粮食十三万余斤，鸡蛋、羊毛、油、梨、党参等十亿余元，换回棉花八万余斤，食盐十一万余斤，洋布近六百匹，其中私商经营在一半以上。开始联营时，有些商人是会有顾虑的。如石家庄市组织了十户货栈业筹集资金五十万元联营，开始时只以三月为期，且约定中途退股办法，现在则已大事经营，业务远达汉口。这说明了在事实证明联营有利时，顾虑是会得到消除的。
    组织商人联营下乡收购的同时，也应鼓励其带货下乡销售。如河北的邢台和石家庄提出“土产商带工业品下乡”，这样对工业生产及供给农民所需是有好处的。尤其在山区物资供应不足情况下更为需要。而且带货下乡，进行收购，既实现了物资交流，而又使商业利润更加增多。也是私商所能作到的。随着商人的营业利润的增大，其经营积极性亦将因而提高。
    此外，为使地区间物资顺利交流，还有必要组织私商尽量和外地客商取得联系，这对开拓销路有很大帮助。河北沧县动员私商用写信、去人等方法联系外地客商前来收购，结果上海、天津、无锡等地买货商人来了四十户。察哈尔宣化市以工商联合会和市人民政府工商科为主，组织私营工商业界贸易访问团访问各地，结果和绥远、包头、龙关、赤城等地各有关行业签订了业务合同，解决了一部分购销问题。
    应当着重指出的，即是合同制在上述各种业务方式及组织形式的进行中所起的重要纽带作用。国营贸易机关、合作社、私营商贩，以及农民个体经济之间在自愿互利的条件下，合理地签订多种多样的合同，已成为组织物资交流中的重要关键。但是，应当注意的，是在合同签订以后，必须遵守信用，严格执行。而及时检查，互相监督，则是保证业务计划的实施，和合同如期兑现的关键。合同的签订，以具体、明确为原则，对于不按合同办事、不守信用者，必须给予应得的处分。这样，使合同制发挥保证物资交流的巨大作用。
            （二）
    开展城乡间和地区间的物资交流，是一个很重要的工作。这一工作对于国计民生的影响很大，各级政府和党的领导机关必须予以足够重视，亲自动手，想出办法，具体组织推动，才能取得较好的成绩。
    有些政府和党委的领导干部轻视贸易工作，采取放任自流的态度，和不愿“做买卖”的思想必须改正。一定要加强领导交流物资的工作，一定要学会做买卖。有的专区和县的干部，只强调领导生产，而忽视贸易工作，是他们不了解把农民的剩余产品推销出去，给农民换回其所迫切需要的生产和生活的资料，正是搞好生产的必备条件，是推动大生产运动的重要环节。
    在领导干部的重视下，察哈尔蔚县最近召开了一次土产会议，召集了全县八镇工商联合会主任、秘书、国营公司、供销社、银行等代表，并邀请本地和外来私营商人参加，由县的负责干部亲自主持，工商行政部门报告了政府在借贷、税收、土产价格、大车运费、市场管理等方面的奖励政策，使私商对“物价前途”、“产品销路”有了进一步认识，并感到经营土产“既有名，又有利”，提高了信心。会上经过分地区分行业的讨论，把商人的经验和政府的调查结合起来，使全体干部了解了土产的情况，懂得经营土产的重要性，在组织商业力量规定和掌握商业计划及公私合作上都有了“底”，大大地推动了物资交流。
    物资交流的方式是多样的，因此需要多方面地发现和创造门路。例如，各地区各城镇间业务上商情上的紧密联络，经常互通产销和供求的情报，即可作为进一步订立购货销货合同的准备。又如通过各种集市庙会、土产大会、生产展览会等形式，亦可能帮助建立各方面的关系，签订合同寻得出路。物资交流的工作，是有计划有领导的，因此须要自上而下地，从行政机关到国营公司、银行、合作社、私营商贩及个体农民等密切结合，统一领导，精确地掌握全面情况，通盘考虑订出计划，然后全体努力地去进行。国营贸易机关和合作社应带领私商共同提高技术，严密计算，使产品符合规格，保证质量，并适应实际情况需要而调配。在价格上，则应正确合理地掌握价格政策，使产、运、销三方面都能得到正当利益。鉴于物资交流工作的繁杂和重要，为了加强领导，有的地区成立了专门的机构。如察省雁北专区和大同市设立了城乡经济管理委员会；山西兴县组成了物资交流管理委员会等。这种专门机构的建立，只要在当地领导机关加以重视，亲自负起责任来，是可能不会流于形式，而对于统一领导，多方面沟通物资交流是有好处的。
    最后，恢复旧的已被破坏的贸易网，积极建立新的贸易网，以及大力组织运输工作，亦是开展物资交流的重要环节之一。注意在中小城镇恢复和建立货栈、客店，改善现有货栈、客店的管理经营，以便利商旅和农民入城，已成为促进物资交流中的重要工作。平原省的武陟、阳城战前有怀货栈三十九户，现只剩下五户。新乡有的地区因为没有竹货行栈，去年外来客商到达当地后无处购货，而当地生产者却无处出售，这也说明了建立商业网的重要性。至于运输工作，则更为物资流转中不可稍加忽略的问题。运输工作除铁路、公路、河运应在可能范围内发挥尽量大的作用，建立联运关系，加速货物周转外，还需要整修必要的其他交通，合理组织一切可以使用的交通工具和运转力量来从事运输。如河北通县专区计划今冬组织胶皮车三千五百辆，手推车及驮贩二万人运输；山西临汾专区准备修公路十五条，发动百分之七十的牲畜牛车参加运输；有些地区组织了运输合作社或合作社组织了运输小组，进行运输工作。对此加以帮助和鼓励，并广泛发动组织，在沿途予以便利并保证其路途安全，以提高其积极性，则对于物资的及时运送将会有很大裨益。
