　　Xinhua News Agency, Paris, January 20th: The Politburo of the French Communist Party has issued a statement on the struggle against the restoration of German armed forces and the peaceful resolution of the German question.

    The statement said: The Politburo of the French Communist Party is pleased to point out that the broad masses of the French people condemn the position of the Pleven government, which is beginning to rearm, making France an accomplice in arming West Germany according to the will of the Washington rulers. This policy, aimed at preparing for a war of aggression against the people's democracies, has aroused the indignation of the people of all countries, whom the American imperialists are trying to use as tools for their aggression plans. The protests of the people that Eisenhower encountered in Paris, Rome, and other capitals he visited, prove that the people of all countries deeply hate the policies of the warmongers.

    The Politburo recalled that the foreign ministers of the Soviet Union, the people's democracies, and the German Democratic Republic, at their meeting in Prague on October 20th and 21st last year, put forward a number of proposals aimed at having the great powers—the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France—issue a joint declaration. In this joint declaration, they would undertake the following obligations: not to allow Germany to be re-militarized, nor to allow it to be dragged into aggression plans; to resolutely implement the Potsdam Agreement in order to ensure the conditions necessary for the establishment of a unified, democratic, and peace-loving Germany; to immediately conclude a peace treaty with Germany in order to establish a unified Germany in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement; and to withdraw all occupation forces from Germany one year after the conclusion of the peace treaty.

    The Korean incident shows that arbitrarily dividing a country into two parts is conducive to the plans of the warmongers and seriously threatens peace. Eisenhower hopes to maintain the division of Germany precisely because he wants to turn West Germany into a base of aggression and a base for inciting the war he intends to launch in Europe.

    Prime Minister Grotewohl of the German Democratic Republic has made a significant contribution to the cause of peace by suggesting that Adenauer take joint steps to swiftly conclude a peace treaty and prepare for the reunification of Germany on a peaceful and democratic basis. Adenauer's refusal to accept Grotewohl's suggestion is indeed contrary to the interests and hopes of the German people. This only reflects the complete subservience of the Bonn rulers to the will of their Washington masters.

    The Politburo emphasized that in Germany, as well as in France, Britain, and all capitalist countries, the leaders of the right-wing Social Democratic parties are the most obedient executors of the policies of war, destruction, and poverty imposed by American imperialism. It is necessary to convince the working people of the Social Democratic parties with an attitude of friendship so as to inspire them to join the ranks against the warmongers.

    The Politburo extends its respects to the German people who are working hard to oppose the revival of the Hitler Wehrmacht. The Politburo believes that the German people's active participation in the struggle against the warmongers has made it possible to immediately peacefully resolve the German question in the spirit of the resolutions of the Second World Peace Congress.

    The French people understand, approve, and support the German people's demand for the speedy conclusion of a peace treaty. Therefore, the French people must do everything in their power to make 1951 a year of crushing the plan to arm Germany and also a year of concluding a peace treaty with a unified, peace-loving, and democratic Germany through the actions of the masses of the people.

    The Politburo, adhering to the principles of national independence and proletarian internationalism, specially calls on party members and party organizations to pay attention: it is necessary to explain to the broad masses of the people that the struggle against the arming of Germany is inseparable from the struggle against the rearmament of France, and the peace fighters of France, Germany, and all other countries must unite in the spirit of the closest mutual concern and fight against the common enemy—the imperialist warmongers who undermine the independence of all countries.

    The Politburo is satisfied with the achievements of the national signature campaign against the rearmament of West Germany, and calls on communists and other peace fighters to work harder to make the French people's struggle to defend peace more resolute and more extensive.

### 法国共产党政治局发表声明  号召法国人民粉碎武装德国计划  支持与统一的民主德国缔结和约

　　法国共产党政治局发表声明
    号召法国人民粉碎武装德国计划
    支持与统一的民主德国缔结和约
    【新华社讯】塔斯社巴黎二十日电：法国共产党政治局顷发表关于反对恢复德国武装部队的斗争以及和平解决德国问题的声明。
    该声明称：法国共产党政治局感到欣慰地指出：法国广大人民群众都谴责普利文政府的立场，这个政府正开始重整军备，使法国成为遵照华盛顿统治者的意志去武装西德的同谋者。这个旨在准备进攻人民民主国家的战争政策，激起了各国人民的愤慨，美帝国主义者正企图利用各国人民作他们侵略计划的工具。艾森豪威尔在巴黎、罗马和他到过的其他各国首都所遇到的人民的抗议，证明了各国人民对战争贩子的政策深恶痛绝。
    政治局追述称：苏联、各人民民主国家和德意志民主共和国的外长于去年十月二十、二十一两日在布拉格举行的会议，提出了许多旨在使各大国——苏、美、英、法——发表一个联合宣言的建议。在这个联合宣言中，它们将承担如下的义务：不允许德国重新军国主义化，也不让它被拖入侵略计划中；坚决实行波茨坦协定，以确保成立统一、民主、爱好和平的德国所必要的条件；立即缔结对德和约，以便遵照波茨坦协定成立统一的德国；在缔结和约一年后，自德国撤退所有占领军。
    朝鲜事件显示：把一个国家专断地划分为两部分是有利于战争贩子们的计划，而且是严重地威胁着和平的。艾森豪威尔希望保持德国的分裂状态，正是因为他要把西德变成侵略基地及挑拨他打算在欧洲发动的战争的基地。
    德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥建议阿登纳联合采取步骤，以便迅速缔结和约，并准备在和平与民主的基础上重新统一德国；这样，他对和平事业作了重大的贡献。阿登纳拒绝接受格罗提渥建议一事，确实是违反德国人民的利益与希望的。这只是反映了波恩统治者完全屈从华盛顿主子的意旨。
    政治局着重指出：在德国，同样也在法国、英国和一切资本主义国家中，右翼社会党的领袖们都是美帝国主义所强制施行的战争、毁灭与贫穷的政策最为驯服的执行人。必须以友爱的态度使人信服地向社会党的劳动人民证明这一点，以便激励他们参加反对战争贩子的队伍。
    政治局谨向努力反对希特勒国防军复活的德国人民致敬。政治局认为：德国人民积极参加反对战争贩子的斗争，已使得按照第二届世界和平大会决议的精神立即和平解决德国问题成为可能。
    法国人民了解、赞成而且支持德国人民尽速缔结和约的要求。因此，法国人民要竭尽一切力量，以便通过人民群众的行动而使一九五一年成为粉碎武装德国之计划的一年，同时也成为与统一的、爱好和平的民主德国缔结和约的一年。
    政治局信守民族独立与无产阶级国际主义的原则，特号召党员和党组织注意：必须向广大的人民群众解释：反对武装德国的斗争与反对法国重整军备的斗争是分不开的，法国、德国以及其他一切国家的和平斗士们必须以最密切地休戚相关的精神团结起来，与共同敌人——破坏各国独立的帝国主义战争贩子们——进行斗争。
    政治局对于反对重新武装西德的全国签名运动所获得的成就感到满意，并号召共产党员与其他和平斗士们更加努力，以便使法国人民保卫和平的斗争更加坚决，更加扩大。
