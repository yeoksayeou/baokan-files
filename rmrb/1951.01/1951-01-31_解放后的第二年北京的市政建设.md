　　Municipal Construction in Beijing in the Second Year After Liberation
    By Xue Zizheng, Secretary-General of the Beijing Municipal People's Government
    Since liberation, Beijing's municipal construction has been carried out under the guiding principle of serving production, serving the people, and serving the capital.
    As is well known, old Beiping was a paradise exclusively for the enjoyment of the reactionary ruling class. The people only had the obligation to contribute their blood and sweat but had no right to enjoy welfare. The city's only modern urban facilities, such as sewers, tap water, asphalt roads, and comfortable housing, were almost all concentrated in the so-called wealthy districts of the eastern and western cities. As for the northern and southern cities where the working people lived, there was only dilapidation and filth, presenting a completely different picture. Now that the people have seized power, if we want to transform old Beiping into new Beijing, we must first make fundamental changes in the city's construction guidelines and policies.
    Beijing's municipal construction work in 1950 focused on improving the city's environmental hygiene and improving the city's transportation. Over the past year, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, with the help of Soviet municipal experts and the cooperation of the people of the city, Beijing has achieved remarkable results in this regard.
    In terms of sanitation projects, the first is the sewer project. Beijing's sewers only covered one-third of the total length of the streets. Due to years of disrepair, most of them were silted up or collapsed, losing their drainage function. In 1950, the city excavated and renovated six systems, including the North and South Ditches, in the twenty-two sewer systems, totaling eighty-two kilometers in length. In addition, twenty-six kilometers of new sewers were built. Among them, the Longxugou, located in the southeast corner of the city, is where the working people live. It was originally an open ditch, almost entirely filled with garbage and sewage. Every summer, it reeked with foul odors, becoming a breeding ground for mosquitoes and flies, which wantonly spread germs of gastrointestinal infectious diseases, seriously endangering the health of local residents. Now the government has converted this open ditch into a covered ditch and rebuilt an eight-kilometer-long sewer. The threat of seasonal diseases and death has been greatly reduced.
    Another major project in Beijing in 1950 to improve the city's environmental hygiene was the river project. Beijing's river and lake system, like the sewer system, had been mostly silted up due to years of disrepair. The famous Beihai, Zhonghai, and Nanhai lakes in the city were originally places exclusively for the court to enjoy and play, with very beautiful scenery. But the most valuable thing is that the three seas have 864,000 square meters of water surface, which plays a great role in regulating the city's air and temperature. However, in recent decades, because the channels for water to flow in and out have been cut off, they have actually become a large stagnant pool. Mosquitoes breed and multiply in summer, becoming the source of many infectious diseases in Beijing, which is very harmful to the city's environmental hygiene. In order to turn the stagnant water of the three seas into living water, the government not only organized a large force to excavate the three seas and Jishuitan, Shicha Houhai, Qianhai, and West Xiaohai, but also dredged the entire river and lake system. Beijing's river and lake system originates from Yuquan Mountain in the western suburbs. One branch passes through the North Long River, Kunming Lake, and the Long River, and the other branch meets the Long River outside Xizhimen via the Jin River. Part of it enters the city and is distributed in Shichahai and the Three Seas, and part of it encircles the city as a moat. Finally, it meets outside Dongbianmen and flows into the Tonghui River. Over the past year, in the project of excavating and dredging rivers and lakes, a total of more than 1.4 million cubic meters of earth have been excavated, and the total length of dredged river channels has reached 60 kilometers. Due to the insufficient water source of Yuquan Mountain, in addition to dredging the Yuquan Mountain spring pool, ten motor-pumped wells were also drilled along the Jin River and Long River, which can increase the water output by 24,000 cubic meters per day. Coupled with the regulation of water storage in Kunming Lake, the water supply problem during the dry season in June every year has been solved. After the water system is unblocked, part of the sewer system injected into the moats of the front three gates can be flushed on time, solving the worry of water accumulation and corrosion. In addition, in order to flexibly dispatch water volume, the old sluice gates were renovated and a new type of sluice gate was rebuilt.
    In terms of improving urban environmental hygiene, 108 public toilets for men and women and 401 sewage pools were newly built throughout the year. The daily output of garbage is about 1,200 tons. During the Kuomintang rule, the garbage in the city was piled up like mountains. Now it has been done so that there is no accumulation, that is, how much is produced every day can be transported away.
    The quality of tap water has also been greatly improved. The water quality testing work has increased from 91 random checks in January to 368 comprehensive checks at the end of the year. A total of 3,500 bacterial tests were carried out throughout the year, an increase of four times compared with 1949, ensuring the cleanliness of drinking water. The supply of tap water has also been expanded. Among the 1.35 million people in the urban area, 1.08 million people now drink tap water, an increase of 460,000 compared with 620,000 in 1949, and the population supplied by the new tap water plant in Mentougou is not included. In the past, the Mentougou mining area mainly drank the dirty water discharged from coal mines. After the new tap water was installed in 1950, not only was the water quality much cleaner, but the price was also much cheaper. In the past, it cost 1,000 yuan in Renminbi to buy a load of clean water in Mentougou, but now it only costs 35 yuan to buy a load of tap water.
    In terms of public health work, the government is based on the principle of prevention first and at the same time taking care of medical treatment. In the past year, four new health centers, one maternal and child health center, and five worker clinics have been built in areas where working people live. The original medical and health institutions have also been enriched and expanded, with 614 new beds added, an increase of 39.16% compared with 1949. In order to take care of the medical treatment of poor citizens, free outpatient services, free hospitalization, and free childbirth have been implemented. In the past year, a total of 172,276 free outpatient visits, 2,335 free hospitalizations, and 2,271 free deliveries were provided. In terms of epidemic prevention, vaccination and injection were vigorously carried out. Throughout the year, 804,338 people were vaccinated against smallpox, 87,573 people were vaccinated with BCG, and 155,211 people were injected with typhoid fever prevention. Due to the adoption of these effective preventive measures, the number of smallpox patients in Beijing in 1950 decreased by 20 times compared with 1949, the number of deaths decreased by 27 times, the number of typhoid fever patients decreased by 2.4 times, and the number of deaths decreased by 2.3 times. In terms of maternal and child health, in order to protect the health of mothers and babies, scientific delivery was promoted and infant health care was strengthened. In 1950, 20,884 pregnant women received scientific delivery, an increase of 14.4% compared with 1949. A total of 98,152 prenatal and postnatal examinations and 12,953 child health examinations were carried out throughout the year. Therefore, the maternal mortality rate decreased by 4.6 per thousand throughout the year, and the infant mortality rate decreased by 22.1 per thousand. In addition, many necessary works have also been done on industrial and mining hygiene and school hygiene.
    Due to the improvement of environmental hygiene and the strengthening of public health work, although the city's population increased by nearly 200,000 in 1950, the number of deaths decreased by 1,880 compared with 1949.
    Improving the city's transportation is another focus of Beijing's municipal construction work in 1950. In this regard, the first is road engineering. Over the past year, in accordance with the principles of connecting industrial centers, opening up important trunk lines, facilitating public transportation, and meeting the needs of the majority of citizens, a total of more than 337,000 square meters of various asphalt roads, cement roads, gravel roads, and cobblestone roads have been newly built. In addition, in combination with production and disaster relief, work was used as a substitute for relief, and 902 hutong dirt roads were repaired. Among the newly built roads, the boulevard and the Jingmen Highway are the most prominent. The completion of the boulevard not only improved the east-west traffic in the city, changed the appearance of the people's capital, but also met the needs of mass parades and reviews. The Jingmen Highway connects Beijing with the Shijingshan Industrial Zone and the Mentougou Mining Area, which is helpful to the development of Beijing's industrial and mining production. In addition, the old roads were maintained, and some bridges and culverts were added.
    In terms of public transportation, the operation of trams and buses has been increased and improved, which has greatly facilitated the transportation of citizens. The improvement of trams is the most significant. The employees take "vehicles are uniform, running on time, vehicles are clean, fares are cheap, and better service for citizens" as the center of their work. In addition to the power plant and repair shop improving quality, eliminating accidents, and ensuring the number of vehicles, the vehicle road employees implement the action slogans such as "turning the back moon into a good moon," "turning rainy days into sunny days," "walking a good ring road," and "safe driving for 20,000 kilometers" to carry more passengers. In order to realize these slogans, the workers, with the awareness of being masters of their own affairs, carried out enthusiastic and selfless labor, and researched and created many new methods. As a result, it exceeded 70.56% of the 1949 task. In 1950, the average daily number of vehicles dispatched was 102 (the average daily number in December has reached 112), an increase of 44 vehicles compared with the average daily number of 68 vehicles in 1949; the monthly number of passengers was 4,003,475, an increase of 1,696,691 compared with the monthly 2,306,754 in 1949. In terms of buses, at the beginning of the takeover, there were only five good cars available. After the government invested in active recovery and development, it also changed its appearance in 1950 and achieved new results. The average daily number of vehicles dispatched throughout the year was 66 (the daily number in December has reached 85), an increase of five and a half times compared with the daily number of 12 vehicles in 1949; the monthly number of passengers has also increased from 142,348 in 1949 to the current 1,363,028, an increase of more than nine times. In addition, in 1950, five suburban lines and four urban lines were added, which facilitated the transportation between the suburbs and the urban area.
    For the safety and smoothness of traffic, openings and arches were opened in Xizhimen and Chongwenmen respectively. In addition, eight new traffic command platforms were added, and nearly 3,000 new street lights of various types were installed, which greatly reduced the occurrence of traffic accidents.
    The main municipal construction work in Beijing in the second year after liberation is as described above. And this was carried out under the difficult conditions that the people's revolutionary war had not completely ended and the country's financial and economic situation had not been fundamentally improved. Therefore, the government can only engage in urban construction based on necessary and possible circumstances. As a modern capital, the road to Beijing's construction is still very long. However, in the past year, through the great efforts of the government and the people, it has had a good start. The solemn, great, magnificent, and magnificent prospect of the people's capital is encouraging us to continue to move forward.

　　解放后的第二年北京的市政建设
    北京市人民政府秘书长  薛子正
    解放以来，北京的市政建设，是在为生产服务、为人民服务、为首都服务的方针下进行的。
    如所周知，旧的北平，是专供反动统治阶级享用的乐园，人民群众只有供献自己血汗的义务，却没有享受福利的权利。全市仅有的一点点现代城市的设备，如下水道、自来水、柏油路以及舒适的住宅等等，几乎全都集中在所谓富贵之区的东西城，至于劳动人民聚居的南北城，那就只有破败和脏污，完全是另一番景象。现在，人民掌握了政权，我们要把旧的北平改建成新的北京，就必须首先从城市建设的路线和方针上加以根本的改变。
    北京一九五○年的市政建设工作，是以改善城市的环境卫生、改善城市的交通事业为重点。一年来，在毛主席和中央人民政府领导之下，经过苏联市政专家的帮助和全市人民的协力，北京在这方面的工作，是获有显著成绩的。
    在卫生工程方面，首先是下水道工程。北京的下水道，只有街道总长的三分之一，由于年久失修，大部都已淤塞或坍塌，失掉了排水的作用。在一九五○年，全市掏挖与整修了二十二个下水道系统中的南北沟沿等六个系统，共长八十二公里，另外还新建下水道二十六公里。其中位于城东南角的龙须沟，系劳动人民聚居的所在，原是一条明沟，几乎全被垃圾、污水所充塞，每到夏季，臭气熏天，成为蚊蝇丛集的渊薮，由它们恣意传播胃肠传染病一类的病菌，严重危害当地居民的健康。现在政府把这条明沟改为暗沟，重新修建了一条八公里长的下水道。季节性的疾病与死亡的威胁便大大减少了。
    一九五○年北京为改善城市环境卫生的另一项巨大工程，是河道工程。北京的河湖水系，也像下水道一样，由于年久失修，多已淤塞。城内有名的北海、中海和南海，以前本是专供宫庭玩赏游乐的地方，风景十分优美。但最可贵的还是三海有八十六万四千平方公尺的水面，它对城市空气和温度的调节，有着很大的作用。可是近数十年来，由于水来水往的通道都已隔断，它们实际上已变成了一个大的死水坑。夏季蚊虫孳生繁殖，竟成了北京许多传染病的发源地，对城市的环境卫生十分有害。为了把三海的死水变成活水，政府不仅组织了很大的力量掏挖了三海和积水潭、什刹后海、前海和西小海，而且疏浚了整个河湖水系。北京的河湖水系发源于西郊的玉泉山，一支经北长河、昆明湖和长河，一支经金河于西直门外和长河会合后，一部入城分布于什刹海及三海，一部环城为护城河，最后又于东便门外会合，流入通惠河。一年来，在掏挖疏浚河湖的工程方面，共出土一百四十多万公方，疏浚了的河道总长达六十公里。由于玉泉山水源不足，除了疏浚玉泉山泉池外，并在金河、长河沿岸，开凿了机井十眼，每日可增出水量二万四千立方公尺。再加上昆明湖蓄水的调剂，每年六月间枯水期的供水问题便得到了解决。水系畅通之后，一部分注入前三门护城河的下水道便可按时冲刷，解决了积水腐蚀之虑。此外，为了灵活调度水量，还整修了旧有的水闸和改建了一部新式水闸。
    在改善城市环境卫生方面，全年还增建了市街男女公共厕所一百零八座，秽水池四百零一座。垃圾每天的产量约一千二百吨，在国民党统治时期，城内的垃圾堆积如山，现在已作到没有积存，即每天产多少就能运除多少。
    自来水的水质也已大大改善。水质的化验工作由一月份抽查九十一次增到年底普遍抽查三六八次。细菌检查全年共三千五百次，比一九四九年增加了四倍，保证了饮水的清洁。自来水的供应量也已扩大，城区一百三十五万人口中，现在饮用自来水的已达一百零八万人，比一九四九年的六十二万增加了四十六万，而门头沟新装自来水所供应的人口还不包括在内。门头沟矿区过去主要是饮用煤井排泄的脏水，一九五○年新装自来水以后，不仅水质远为清洁，而且价钱也便宜多了。过去在门头沟要买一挑清水须花人民币一千元，现在买一挑自来水只合三十五元。
    在公共卫生工作方面，政府是本着预防为主同时照顾到医疗的方针。一年间，在劳动人民聚居的地区，新建卫生所四处，妇幼保健所一处，工人诊疗所五处，原有各医疗卫生机构也得到了充实与扩大，病床新增六百十四张，比一九四九年增加了百分之三十九点一六。为了照顾贫苦市民的医疗，实行了免费门诊，免费住院和免费接生等办法。一年间，共免费门诊十七万二千二百七十六次，免费住院二千三百三十五人，免费接生二千二百七十一人。在防疫工作上，大力进行了预防接种和注射，全年牛痘接种八十万四千三百三十八人，卡介苗接种八万七千五百七十三人，伤寒预防注射十五万五千二百十一人。由于采取了这些有效的预防措施，一九五○年北京的天花患者比一九四九年减少了二十倍，死亡者减少了二十七倍，伤寒患者减少了二点四倍，死亡者减少了二点三倍，在妇幼卫生方面，为了保护母亲和婴儿健康，推广实行了科学接生，加强了婴儿保健。一九五○年接受科学接生的产妇二万零八百八十四人，比一九四九年增加了百分之十四·四。全年产前产后检查九万八千一百五十二次，儿童健康检查一万二千九百五十三人。因此，全年产妇死亡率减少了千分之四点六，婴儿死亡率减少了千分之二十二点一。此外，对工矿卫生和学校卫生也作了许多必要的工作。
    由于环境卫生的改善和公共卫生工作的加强，一九五○年全市人口虽增加了近二十万人，而人口死亡数却比一九四九年减少了一千八百八十人。
    改善城市交通事业，是北京一九五○年市政建设工作的另一个重点。在这方面，首先是道路工程。一年来，在连结产业中心、打通重要干线、便利公共交通、适应多数市民需要的原则下，新修了各种沥青路、水泥路、石碴路、卵石路等共计三十三万七千多平方公尺，并结合生产救灾，以工代赈，修整了胡同土路九百零二条。在新修道路中以林荫大道和京门公路最为突出，林荫大道的修成，不仅改善了市区东西的交通，改变了人民首都的市容，而且适应了群众游行检阅的需要。京门公路则联系了北京和石景山工业区及门头沟矿区，有助于京市工矿生产事业的发展。此外，对旧路进行了保养，并增建了一些桥梁涵洞。
    在公共交通工具方面，增加和改善了电车和公共汽车的行驶，大大便利了市民的交通。电车的改进最为显著，职工们以“车当匀，走正点，车辆清洁，票价低廉，更好的为市民服务”为工作中心，除发电厂修造厂以提高质量、消灭事故、保证出车数量外，车路员工则以实现“背月变好月”、“雨天变晴天”、“走好环行路”、“安全行车两万公里”等行动口号来更多的载运乘客，为了实现这些口号，工人们以主人翁的自觉性，进行了热情高涨的忘我劳动，钻研创造了许多新办法。结果超过了一九四九年任务的百分之七十点五六。一九五○年每日平均出车一○二辆（十二月平均每日已达一一二辆），比一九四九年平均每日的六八辆增加了四十四辆；每月乘客人数为四百万零三千四百七十五人，比一九四九年每月的二百三十万六千七百五十四人增加了一百六十九万六千六百九十一人。在公共汽车方面，在接管初期能用的好车只有五辆，经政府投资积极恢复与发展后，一九五○年也改变了面貌，取得了新的成绩。全年平均每日出车六十六辆（十二月份每日已达八十五辆），比一九四九年每日的十二辆增加了五倍半；每月乘客数也由一九四九年的十四万二千三百四十八人增至现在的一百三十六万三千零二十八人，提高了九倍以上。此外，在一九五○年内，增设了郊区线路五条，市内线路四条。便利了城郊与市区之间的交通。
    为了交通的安全和畅达，并在西直门和崇文门各开辟了豁口和拱门。另外添建交通指挥台八座，新按装各种路灯近三千盏，大大减少了交通事故的发生。
    在解放后的第二年，北京的市政建设工作，主要的就如上述。而这是在人民革命战争尚未完全结束，国家财政经济尚未根本改善的困难条件下所进行的。因此，政府只能依据必需与可能的情况来从事城市的建设。作为一个现代化的都城，北京建设的路程还遥远得很，然而过去的一年，经过政府与人民巨大的努力，它已经有了一个良好的开端。人民首都庄严伟大雄奇瑰丽的远景正鼓舞着我们继续前进。
