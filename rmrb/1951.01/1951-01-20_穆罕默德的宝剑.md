Muhammad's Sword
Professor Ma Jian, Peking University

On January 10, 1951, the Guangming Daily in Beijing published an article by Mr. Lu Hongji entitled "The Incoherent Uncle Sam." The author said: "Poor people, they only know Muhammad, who held a sword in one hand and the classics in the other, but they don't know that someone takes guns and cannons in one hand, money in the other—right, and another hand takes 'morality.' This is called the 'triple thief' (掱手) face."

Some Hui compatriots in Beijing believe that the author compared their beloved religious leader Muhammad to the American "triple thief," which is disrespectful or a misunderstanding of Islam. Many people requested the Ethnic Affairs Section of the Beijing Municipal People's Government Civil Affairs Bureau to convene a meeting of representatives from all walks of life in Beijing's Hui community to discuss this issue. On the 16th, the Ethnic Affairs Section held a meeting of representatives from all walks of life in the Hui community at the Zhongshan Hall in Zhongshan Park. Hui workers from industrial institutions such as Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, Beijing People's Printing Factory, and Beijing Electric Tram Company, Hui educators and students from major and minor schools in Beijing, Hui comrades from the Beijing Municipal Government, and Hui people from various trade associations and districts of Beijing all sent their representatives to attend this important meeting. After Chairman Ma Yuhai spoke, Mr. Gao Tian, ​​a representative from the Guangming Daily, made a sincere self-criticism. Their speeches were applauded by the whole audience. Representatives from all walks of life spoke and unanimously expressed their support for the reasonable, legal, and peaceful resolution of the issue proposed by Comrade Ma Yuhai. Finally, the chairman put this proposal to a formal vote, and the entire audience unanimously approved the correct proposal put forward by Comrade Ma Yuhai. The meeting concluded successfully.

But did Muhammad really spread his religion by force? I am a member of the Hui community and a professor of Arab national history and Islamic Studies at Peking University. I have done some research on this issue. Therefore, before the proposal was put to a vote, the chairman asked me to talk to everyone about this issue. After the meeting, I was asked to write an article to clarify the truth of this historical issue, so as to avoid similar writings in future books and periodicals. The Guangming Daily welcomed such an article. I myself think this is necessary, because this erroneous statement is widely spread and has misled many people. Not to mention previously published books and newspapers, but also in new books published after liberation, there is still this erroneous view. The junior high school foreign history textbook (written by Shen Changhong) published by Xinhua Bookstore is a clear example. This issue deserves attention and research. Because the ethnic minorities in China who believe in Islam are not only the Hui people in the inland, but also the Uygur, Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Uzbek, Tatar, Tajik, Salar, and Dongxiang people in the northwest. They are all very concerned about these kinds of issues. The ethnic policy of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is extremely correct and unanimously supported by all ethnic groups in the country. However, all ethnic groups in the country must understand each other in order to respect each other; they must respect each other in order to unite and help each other and form a big family of friendship and cooperation among all ethnic groups. Most of the oppressed peoples in Asia believe in Islam. To unite these vast peoples in the common struggle against imperialism, we should also have a correct understanding of their beloved religious leader Muhammad. Therefore, I venture to write this article in the hope of arousing everyone's attention and interest in this issue. Experts in world history, please give your advice.
   (1) Muhammad's Background and Early Preaching
On April 20, 571 AD (March 9th of the lunar calendar), Muhammad was born in the city of Mecca in Arabia. Two months before his birth, his father had died in a foreign land, leaving him only five camels, a few ewes, and a female slave. He lost his mother at the age of six and was raised by his frail grandfather. When he was eight years old, his grandfather passed away, and he was raised by his uncle. His uncle was intelligent and righteous, but his family was poor and he had many children, so he could not support him and made him herd sheep for others. In his youth, he drove camels for others. At the age of twenty-five, he worked for Khadija, a wealthy widow in Mecca, doing business. He had a healthy and beautiful physique, and was gentle, respectful, kind, and amiable. Khadija asked someone to propose marriage to him. He accepted her request, and after marriage, he continued to engage in commerce and had some savings to maintain his livelihood. There was nothing special about the period from the age of twenty-five to forty.

At the age of forty, he suddenly announced that he had received the revelation of Allah (God), appointing him as a messenger to teach the world. He preached in Mecca for thirteen years, teaching the Meccans not to be superstitious about ghosts and gods, not to worship idols, not to oppress women, not to open brothels, not to bully orphans, not to exploit the poor, not to lend money at high interest rates, not to abuse slaves, not to engage in prostitution and gambling, not to steal and plunder, and not to kill each other. He taught them to worship only the unique creator Allah, taught them to unite and help each other, treat slaves well, release slaves, respect women, pity orphans, relieve the poor, and strive to study and produce while paying attention to cleanliness and hygiene. During this period, the general public, especially slaves and the poor, believed in his religion in small groups. His family members and his major disciples Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman, and Ali, etc., were among the earliest to convert. Abu Dharr and his brother Unais and their mother were among the early converts. After they returned to the Ander tribe, Abu Dharr preached Islam to the people of his tribe, and half of the tribe converted to Islam. More and more people in Medina believed in him. The ruling class in Mecca initially ridiculed him, and later, resented and opposed him. In the seventh year of his preaching, believers who could not bear the persecution of the reactionaries were ordered to take refuge in Abyssinia. There were eighty-three men and eighteen women. Many others could not escape and were still persecuted in Mecca. Before the tenth year of preaching, twenty Christians from Najran in Yemen converted to Islam. The ruling class, fearing that Muhammad's revolution would succeed and they would not be able to maintain their own class interests, used all kinds of despicable means of inducement and coercion against him. Muhammad said: "Even if they put the sun in my right hand and the moon in my left hand, I would not give up this cause." Finally, they decided to kill him, and he fled to Medina. At that time, most of his followers had already fled there, leaving only some old, weak, women, and children who could not escape.

(2) Why Muhammad Took Up the Sword
The people of Mecca relied entirely on trade for their livelihood. They often went to Syria in the north to do business, and Medina was their necessary route. Muhammad's occupation of Medina was the biggest threat to them, and they had to eliminate him. At this time, the situation changed. This was the time when Muhammad took up arms to prepare for self-defense. Therefore, he received the revelation saying: "Permission to fight is given to those who are fought against, because they have been wronged, and surely Allah is Able to help them." (Quran 22:39) The purpose of the Meccans was to annihilate them or force them to abandon Islam. Therefore, the Quran says: "And they will not cease fighting you until they turn you back from your religion if they can." (2:217) The second revelation said: "Fight in the way of Allah against those who fight against you, but do not transgress. Surely Allah does not love the transgressors." (2:190) The Meccans attacked the city of Medina several times, but were repelled. The number of believers in Islam increased day by day, and their power gradually became great. The persecution suffered by the remaining believers in Mecca reached its extreme. Muhammad received the revelation to liberate Mecca, saying: "And what is [the matter] with you that you do not fight in the cause of Allah and [for] the oppressed among men and women and children who say, "Our Lord, take us out of this city of oppressive people and appoint for us from Yourself a protector and appoint for us from Yourself a helper?" (4:75) In late January 630 AD, he led an army of 10,000 people to liberate the city of Mecca without encountering much resistance. He only ordered the execution of a few heinous villains, and pardoned the rest of the enemies. They were inspired by his great personality and soon believed in his religion.

He only opposed feudal superstition. As for legitimate religions, they were all recognized and protected, without any interference or oppression. Therefore, the Quran says: "Surely those who believe, and those who are Jews, and the Christians, and the Sabians—whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day and does good, they shall have their reward from their Lord, and there is no fear for them, nor shall they grieve." (2:62)

Islam was the first to declare the principle of freedom of belief: "Say, 'The truth is from your Lord, so whoever wills - let him believe; and whoever wills - let him disbelieve.'" (Quran 18:29) "And if your Lord had willed, whoever is in the earth would have believed - all of them entirely. Then, [O Muhammad], would you compel the people until they become believers?" (10:99) "There shall be no compulsion in [acceptance of] the religion. The right course has become clear from the wrong." (2:256)

From this, it can be seen that Muhammad took up the sword to resist the attacks of the reactionaries and to suppress the counter-revolutionaries, not to force others to believe in his religion. That would be contrary to the teachings of Islam and, in fact, impossible. Because the issue of belief is a matter of thought. To make people believe in something or not believe in something, it must go through long-term persuasion and education. The use of force will never succeed.

Western modern scholars who can conduct objective research on religion have understood that Islam is not spread by force. For example, Dr. Gustave Le Bon advocated this, saying:
"History has proven that all religions cannot be forcibly imposed on people. When the Christians conquered the Arabs of Andalusia, most of them were willing to face the death penalty or be expelled rather than abandon Islam.

Islam is spread through propaganda, not through the sword. Because of propaganda, the nations conquered by the Arabs, such as the Turks and the Tartars, have all converted to Islam. Because of propaganda, Islam spread through India, which the Arabs passed through, and the population of Muslims there has reached 50 million (now more than 70 million - translator). Because of propaganda, the population of Indian Muslims is increasing day by day. Although the British, who now rule India, have cultivated many missionaries and constantly sent them to India to preach Christianity to the Muslims, it has no effect.

The Arabs did not conquer any part of China, but the Quran is spread as widely in China as in other places. Readers can see in another chapter (Chapter 2, Section 5 - translator) how quickly Islam spread in China. The population of Muslims in China has exceeded 20 million." (Lacivilisation des Arabes, Paris, 1884)

Friends who study the history of Southeast Asia all know that the residents of Malaya, Indonesia, and the Philippine Islands voluntarily believe in Islam. Muhammad's military force did not reach those places.

Imperialists, especially American imperialists, in order to conquer Asia and enslave the people of Asia, have exhausted all kinds of conspiracies to undermine the unity of the Asian people. They spread everywhere that Muhammad spread his religion by force, in order to cause separation and friction between Muslims and non-Muslims. This is something we should be wary of. I have exposed this conspiracy in the article "American Imperialism is the Mortal Enemy of Islam" (see People's Daily, November 26, 1950). I hope that all ethnic compatriots across the country who believe in Islam will step up production and work hard to support the sacred struggle of resisting America, aiding Korea, defending the home, and defending the country. This is our bounden duty to the motherland. Do not let this small problem affect the united front of all ethnic groups, parties, and strata across the country.

### 穆罕默德的宝剑

　　穆罕默德的宝剑
    北京大学教授  马坚
    一九五一年一月十日，北京光明日报刊载卢洪基先生的一篇以“语无伦次的山姆大叔”为题的文章，作者说：“可怜的人们，能知道过一手执剑一手执经典的穆罕默德，却不知道一手拿枪炮，一手拿钱——对了，还有一只手拿‘道义’这就叫做‘掱手’的掱手面目。”
    北京市的部分回民同胞，认为作者把他们所敬爱的教祖穆罕默德与美国的“掱手”相提并论，这是对于回教的不尊重或误解，许多人要求北京市人民政府民政局民族事务科召集北京市各界回民代表会议，讨论这个问题。十六日上午民族事务科在中山公园中山堂举行各界回民代表会议。石景山钢铁厂、北京市人民印刷厂、北京市电车公司等工业机构的回民工人们，北京市各大中小学校的回民教育工作者和回民同学们，北京市政府的回民工作同志们，各行业公会、各市区的回民们，都选派了自己的代表去参加这个重要的会议。主席马玉槐同志发言后，由光明日报代表高天先生作了一个诚恳的自我检讨。他们两位的发言，都博得全场的鼓掌。各界代表发言，一致表示拥护马玉槐同志所提出的合理合法和平解决问题的主张。最后，主席提出这个议案正式表决，全场一致通过马玉槐同志所提出的正确主张。这次会议就这样成功的结束了。
    但穆罕默德到底是不是以武力传教的呢？笔者是回民一分子，而且是在北京大学教授阿拉伯民族史和伊斯兰教概论的，对于这个问题，多少有一点研究，因此，在议案付表决之前，主席要我对大家讲一讲这个问题。散会后，又要我写一篇文章，说明这个历史问题的真相，以免各种书刊上将来再发生同样的文字。光明日报表示欢迎这样的一篇文章。我自己也认为这是必要的，因为这个错误的说法，流传很广，蒙蔽了不少的人，以前出版的书报不必说，就是解放后出版的新书里，也还有这个错误的观点，新华书店出版的初级中学外国历史课本（沈长虹著）便是明显的例证。这个问题，是值得注意、值得研究的。因为国内少数民族信仰伊斯兰教的不仅是内地的回族，还有西北的维吾尔族、哈萨克族、阿尔吉孜族、乌孜别克族、塔塔尔族、塔吉克族、撒拉族、东乡族。他们对于这一类的问题，都是很关心的。中国人民政协共同纲领的民族政策，是极正确的，是国内各民族一致拥护的。但国内各民族，必须互相了解，才能互相尊重；必须互相尊重，才能团结互助，组成各民族友爱合作的大家庭。亚洲上被压迫的各民族的人民，大部分是信仰伊斯兰教的，我们要联合这些广大的人民共同作反帝斗争，对于他们所敬爱的教祖穆罕默德，也应当有一个正确的认识。因此，我不揣冒昧，写出这篇文章，希望引起大家对于这个问题的注意和兴趣。研究世界史的专家们，请多多指教。
            （一）穆罕默德的出身和初期的传道
    公元五七一年四月二十日（太阴历三月九日），穆罕默德诞生于阿拉比亚（天方国）的墨克（默伽）城。在他出世之前两个月，他父亲已死在异乡，只给他遗留下五只骆驼，几只母羊和一个女奴。他六岁丧母，由衰朽的祖父扶养。八岁时祖父去世，由伯父扶养。他伯父明达好义，但家境清寒，子女很多，不能赡养他，使他去替人牧羊。他在青年时代，替别人赶骆驼。他二十五岁时，替墨克城的富孀赫底彻做买卖。他有健而美的体格，而且温良恭谨，恺悌慈祥。赫底彻托人向他求婚，他接受了她的要求，结婚后，仍然从事商业，稍有积蓄，可以维持生计。二十五岁至四十岁的期间，没有什么表现。
    四十岁时，他突然宣布他奉安拉（上帝）的启示，委任他为使者，叫他来教化世人。他在墨克传道十三年，教墨克人不要迷信鬼神，不要崇拜偶像，不要压迫妇女，不要开设妓院，不要欺负孤儿，不要剥削贫民，不要放高利贷，不要虐待奴隶，不要狂嫖滥赌，不要偷盗劫掠，不要互相残杀。教他们只崇拜唯一的造物主安拉，教他们团结互助，优待奴隶，释放奴隶，尊重妇女，怜恤孤儿，救济贫民，努力学习，努力生产，讲究清洁卫生。在这个期间，一般人民，特别是奴隶和贫民，三个两个的信奉他的宗教。他的家属和他的大弟子艾卜·伯克尔、欧默尔·欧斯曼、阿里等，都是入教很早的。艾卜·赞尔和他的弟弟吴奈斯和他们的母亲，都是初期入教的。他们转回安德尔部落后，艾卜·赞尔向本部落的人宣传伊斯兰教，半部落的人，便入伊斯兰教。默底纳人信奉他的逐渐增多。墨克的统治阶级，起初嘲笑他，后来，怨恨他，反对他。他传教的第七年，信徒们受不了反动派的迫害，奉命到阿比西尼亚避难的，有男子八十三人，妇女十八人。还有许多人，不能逃避，依然在墨克遭受迫害。传道的第十年以前，也门区奈支兰城的基督教徒二十人，改宗伊斯兰教。统治阶级恐怕穆罕默德的革命成功，不能保持自己的阶级利益，对于他用尽了利诱威迫的卑劣手段，穆罕默德说：“假若他们把太阳放在我的右手里，把月亮放在我的左手里，我也不愿放弃这件事。”最后，他们决计杀害他，他才逃到默底纳去。那时，他的信徒已大部分逃到那里去了，只剩下一些老弱妇孺，不能逃走。
            （二）穆罕默德为什么拿起了宝剑
    墨克人是全靠贸易吃饭的，他们经常到北方的叙利亚去做买卖，而默底纳是他们的必经之地，穆罕默德占据了默底纳，对于他们是一个最大的威胁，他们一定要去消灭他。在这个时候，形势改变了，这是穆罕默德拿起武器来准备自卫的时候了，因此，他奉到启示说：“被攻击的人，已得抗战的许可了，因为他们是被压迫的。安拉对于援助他们，确是全能的。”（古兰经二二∶三九）墨克人的目的，是歼灭他们，或强迫他们放弃伊斯兰教，故古兰经说：“倘若他们能力充足，势必继续进攻你们，务使你们叛教。”（二∶二一七）第二次奉到的启示说：“你们当为主道（正义、人道）而抵抗进攻你们的人，你们不要过分。因为安拉必定不喜爱过分的人。”（二∶一九○）墨克人几次进攻默底纳城，都被打退了。伊斯兰教的信徒，逐日增加，他们的声势逐渐浩大，留在墨克的教徒们所遭的迫害，惨酷达于极点，穆罕默德奉到解放墨克的启示说：“你们怎么不为（保护）主道和（解放）老弱妇孺而作战呢？他们常说：我们的主呀！求你从这个虐民所居的城市里把我们救出去。求你为我们从你的阙下委任一个保护者，求你为我们从你的阙下委任一个援助者。”（四∶七五）公元六三○年一月下旬他统率一万人，解放墨克城，没有遇到什么抵抗。他只下令处死了几个罪大恶极的坏人，其余的敌人，都赦免了。他们为他的伟大的人格所感召，不久都信奉了他的宗教。
    他只反对封建迷信，至于正当的宗教，一律获得承认和保护，不受任何干涉和压迫。故古兰经说：“信道的人（指伊斯兰教徒而言——笔者）、犹太教徒、基督教徒、拜星教徒，凡信安拉（上帝）和末日，并且行善的，将来在主的阙下必得享受自己的报酬，他们将来没有恐惧，也不忧愁。”（二∶六二）
    伊斯兰教首先宣布信仰自由的原则：“你说：这（古兰经）是从你们的主降示的真理，谁愿意信道，就让他信罢；谁不愿意信道，就让他不信罢。”（古兰经一八∶二九）“假若你的主意欲，大地上的人，必定统统都信道了。难道你要强迫众人都做信士么？”（一○∶九九）“对于宗教，绝无强迫，因为正邪确已分明了。”（二∶二五六）
    由此可见，穆罕默德拿起宝剑，是为抵抗反动派的进攻，是为镇压反革命分子，不是为强迫别人信仰他的宗教，那是违背伊斯兰的教义的，而且事实上是不可能的。因为信仰问题是一个思想问题，要人信仰什么，或不信仰什么，必须经过长期的说服教育，使用武力是绝对不会成功的。
    西方的现代学者对于宗教能作客观研究的人，已明白伊斯兰教不是靠武力传布的，例如勒朋（Dr'Gustave Le Bon）就是这样主张的，他说：
    “历史已经证实了，一切宗教，都是不能用武力强人信仰的。基督教徒战胜了安达卢西亚（Andalusia）的阿拉伯人的时候，他们大部分愿意受死刑或被驱逐，不愿意放弃伊斯兰教。
    伊斯兰教是借宣传而传布的，不是借宝剑而传布的。由于宣传，阿拉伯人所战胜的民族，如突厥人和鞑靼人，都信奉了伊斯兰教。由于宣传，伊斯兰教传布于阿拉伯人所经过的印度，那里的伊斯兰教徒的人口，已达到了五千万（现在是七千多万——译者）。由于宣传，印度伊斯兰教徒的人口逐日增加，尽管现在统治着印度的英国人培养了许多传教士，不断的派遣他们到印度去对伊斯兰教徒宣传基督教，但毫无效果。
    阿拉伯人并没有征服中国的任何一部分，但古兰经在中国境内传布之广，并不亚于其他的地方，读者在另一章里（第二章第五节——译者）可以看到伊斯兰教在中国传布的迅速，中国伊斯兰教徒的人口，已超过了两千万。”（Lacivilisation des Arabes,Paris,1884）
    研究东南亚历史的朋友们，大家都知道马来亚、印度尼西亚、菲律宾群岛的居民，都是自愿的信奉伊斯兰教的，穆罕默德的武力，并没有达到那些地方。
    帝国主义者，特别是美帝国主义者，为了要征服亚洲，要奴役亚洲上的人民，用尽了各种阴谋来破坏亚洲人民的团结，他们到处宣传穆罕默德以武力传教，就是想借此引起伊斯兰教徒与非伊斯兰教徒之间的隔阂和摩擦，这是我们应该警惕的。笔者在“美帝国主义是伊斯兰教的死敌”一文中已揭穿了这种阴谋（见一九五○年十一月二十六人民日报），希望全国信奉伊斯兰教的各族同胞们加紧生产，努力支援抗美援朝保家卫国的神圣斗争，这是我们对于祖国应尽的天职，千万不要让这个小问题，影响到全国各民族各党派各阶层的统一战线。
