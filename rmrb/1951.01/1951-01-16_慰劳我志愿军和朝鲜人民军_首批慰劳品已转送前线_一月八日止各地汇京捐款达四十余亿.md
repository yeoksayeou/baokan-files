As of January 8th, the General Association of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression has received over 4 billion yuan in donations from across the country. This donation will soon be used by the General Association to purchase goods and forward them to the Korean front lines.

The comfort bags sent from Xinjiang and Ningxia provinces are filled with local products - white raisins and Hami melon jerky. Farmers in Xigang Village in Weishi County, Henan, and Donggou Village in Benxi County, Northeast, affectionately wrote in their letters of sympathy to the Volunteer Army: We will take care of your family members, and we will cultivate your land in your place. We will put our own work aside and do your family's work first. Women in various regions are carefully rushing to make millions of pairs of cotton shoes, cotton socks, gloves, and cotton-padded clothing and quilts, which are being rushed to the Korean front lines. They sincerely wrote in their letters of sympathy: Comrades, when you put on these cotton shoes, you will remember how much we, the millions of women, love and support you. We hope you will be warm and kill more enemies. The Xi'an Federation of Industry and Commerce also raised over 100 million yuan in donations and a large number of comfort goods.
