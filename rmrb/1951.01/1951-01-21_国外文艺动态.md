　　Foreign Literary Trends
　　The Soviet Union's Literary Publishing Undertaking in 1951
　　In the Soviet Union, the publication of literary works is increasing year after year. Last year, the State Literary Publishing House alone published 42 million copies, one and a half times more than in 1949 and twelve times more than in the pre-war year of 1940.
　　Many works by individual Russian classical writers, modern Soviet writers, and world classical writers have been published. In 1950, the publication of twenty complete collections began, nine of which have already been completed. These are complete collections of Pushkin, Gogol, Shakespeare, Shelley, Maupassant, Chekhov, Shevchenko, Dobrolyubov, Nekrasov, Chernyshevsky, etc.
　　The State Publishing House is preparing to implement a wide-ranging plan in 1951. A new complete collection of Tolstoy will be published, the publication of the complete collection of Gorky will continue, and it is planned to publish complete collections of foreign writers such as Balzac, Martin Andersen Nexø, and Petőfi. In addition, there are dozens of works by Soviet writers.
　　In 1951, the publishing undertaking will pay the greatest attention to binding and will prepare to invite the best Soviet painters to create illustrations for the books.
　　How Western Bourgeois Writers Answered Ehrenburg
　　Last spring, Ehrenburg published an open letter calling on Western writers to sign the Stockholm Appeal to show their attitude towards the world's people's movement to defend peace. Are they against the use of atomic weapons? Or do they support it? Do they support peace? Or do they support a third world war? As a writer and friend, Ehrenburg made this sincere and ardent request to American writers Hemingway, Caldwell, and Steinbeck, to French writer André Maurois, and to British writer Priestley, among others. Although these are all bourgeois writers, they have written some progressive works in the past and should, in principle, support peace and oppose atomic weapons. However, they did not give Ehrenburg a good answer. They either refused to sign or remained silent, not expressing their attitude. Ehrenburg recently published an article entitled "Answers to Questions," discussing these reactions.
　　Priestley's reply was that he could not sign the declaration declaring atomic weapons illegal because Soviet writers did not attend an international conference to discuss drama. Ehrenburg said that this sounded like a joke, but the old British writer wrote it very seriously in his letter. Ehrenburg said that he valued the art of drama very much and respected playwrights, but he was not discussing drama with Priestley now. "When there are atomic bombs on the table instead of tea sets, how can we calmly talk about drama?"
　　Maurois participated in the Resistance during the French occupation. But his reply was: "I am against the atomic bomb, but I do not want to express my opposition by signing; I want to use my whole life and do everything I can to oppose it." Ehrenburg said that these words made him very happy, but the fact could not satisfy him. It turned out that even if Maurois was willing to use his whole life and do everything he could to oppose the atomic bomb, he would not even take a pen, spend a few seconds, and sign his name on the declaration against atomic weapons. His reason was that signing would damage his reputation and status! Ehrenburg said that a writer who can work for peace will only gain more popular support. Was Thomas Mann not more respected by people who love justice and peace after signing the declaration? Was Tolstoy, the author of "War and Peace," not also the author of the essay "I Cannot Be Silent"? Tolstoy's reputation did not suffer as a result.
　　In his reply to Ehrenburg, there was also an Austrian gentleman, Mr. Thieling, who was not a writer, but also "responded" to Ehrenburg. Ehrenburg revealed the true face of this physicist, Mr. Thieling. It turned out that while participating in the Austrian Peace Congress, he also attended a conference hosted by American warmongers in West Berlin. Ehrenburg said that the fact that these two Mr. Thielings coexisted was very legendary and romantic. But this set of deceptive tricks is already outdated.
　　Hemingway and Steinbeck are still silent. Ehrenburg said to those who remain silent that a writer is not a diplomat and should be able to answer yes or no. "I believe they are still considering this issue. I continue to await their reply." Finally, he asked all honest writers in the West to participate in the just movement to defend peace, but those cowards, liars, and those who pursue the same goals as the rascals who spread plague bacteria and potato beetles can only be allowed to leave the ranks of the peace-loving people.

  一九五一年苏联的文学出版事业
    在苏联，文学作品的出版，年复一年地增加着。去年仅国家文学出版局就出版了四千二百万册，比一九四九年多一倍半，比战前一九四○年多十二倍。
    个别的俄国古典作家的著作，现代苏联作家的著作，以及世界古典文学家的著作，都出版了很多。一九五○年开始出版二十种全集，其中九种已经完成。这些是普希金、果戈里、莎士比亚、雪莱、莫泊桑、契诃夫、谢夫琴科、杜布罗留包夫、涅克拉索夫、车尔尼雪夫斯基等全集。
    国家出版局在一九五一年预备实现一个范围广泛的计划。将出版新的托尔斯泰全集，继续出版高尔基全集，并计划出巴尔扎克、马丁·安特逊·尼克索和彼多斐等外国作家的全集。此外尚有数十种苏联作家的著作。
    一九五一年的出版事业将对装订方面予以最大的注意，并准备邀请苏联最好的画家来作书中的插图。
  西方资产阶级作家怎样回答爱伦堡
    在去年春天，爱伦堡发表了一封公开信，呼吁西方作家在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名，以表明他们对全世界人民的保卫和平运动采取什么态度。他们反对采用原子武器？还是赞成？他们拥护和平？还是赞成第三次世界大战？爱伦堡以一个作家和友人的身份，向美国作家海敏威、卡特威尔、斯坦培克，向法国作家安特莱·桑宋，向英国作家普列斯特莱等发出了这个诚恳而热情的请求。这些虽都是资产阶级作家，但在过去曾经多少写过一些进步作品，按理说是应该拥护和平，反对原子武器的。可是他们并没有给爱伦堡很好的答复。他们或则拒绝签名，或则保持沉默，不表示态度。爱伦堡最近发表一篇“问题的答复”的文章，谈到这些反响。
    普列斯特莱的答复是，他不能签名在宣布原子武器为非法的宣言上，因为苏联作家没有去参加一个讨论戏剧问题的国际会议。爱伦堡说，这句话听起来像开玩笑，可是那位英国老作家却是在信上很认真地写着的。爱伦堡说，他很重视戏剧艺术，也尊敬剧作家，可是现在他并不是在和普列斯特莱讨论戏剧问题。“当桌上放着原子弹而不是放着茶具的时候，我们怎么能镇静地谈论戏剧呢？”
    桑宋曾经在法国沦陷时期，参加了抵抗运动。可是他的答复是：“我是反对原子弹的，但我不愿用签名来表示反对，我要用我整个生命，并尽一切力量来反对它。”爱伦堡说，这些话听起来使他很高兴，可是那件事实却不能使他满意，原来桑宋即使肯用整个生命并尽一切力量来反对原子弹，却竟然不肯拿一枝笔，花几秒钟，签一个名字在反对原子武器的宣言上。他的理由是签了名会使他的名誉地位受到损失！爱伦堡说，一个作家能为争取和平努力，只有更加取得人民的拥护。汤默斯·曼在宣言上签了名不是更受爱好正义和平的人民的尊敬吗？“战争与和平”的作者托尔斯泰不同时也是“我不能沉默”的论文的作者吗？托尔斯泰的名誉并没有因此而受到损失。
    在给爱伦堡的复信中，还有一位奥国的铁林先生，他不是作家，可是也“响应”了爱伦堡。爱伦堡揭穿了这位物理学家铁林先生的真正面目，原来他一方面参加奥国和平大会，却又出席西柏林美国战争贩子们所主持的会议。爱伦堡说这两位铁林先生同时存在的事实，很具有传奇和浪漫的气氛。可是这一套骗人的玩意儿早已过时了。
    海敏威和斯坦培克到现在还是一声不响。爱伦堡对那些保持沉默的人说，一个作家不是一个外交家，是应该能够回答一下是和否的。“我相信他们还在考虑这个问题。我继续等待着他们的答复。”最后他要求所有西方的诚实的作家都参加保卫和平的正义运动，可是那些懦夫们、骗子们以及和散布瘟疫细菌、马铃薯甲虫的流氓们追求着同一目标的人们，只有让他们离开和平人民的阵营了。
