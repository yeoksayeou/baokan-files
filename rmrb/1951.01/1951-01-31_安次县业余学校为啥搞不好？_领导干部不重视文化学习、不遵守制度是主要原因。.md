　　Why is the Amateur School in Anci County Not Doing Well?
　　-- Leaders' Lack of Attention to Cultural Learning and Failure to Comply with Regulations are the Main Reasons.
　　The cultural supplementary school for cadres in Anci County, Hebei Province, started in September of last year. In less than three weeks, the students' enthusiasm gradually slackened, and the number of people decreased day by day. Out of the eighteen county-level departments, 356 people should have participated in the learning, but only about 100 people attend school every day now. In addition to those who go to the countryside for work and those with special matters, many people do not participate in learning even when they have time to study. The reason for the above phenomenon is mainly that the county-level leaders neglect cultural learning and fail to lead by example. For example, County Head Shi Hongtao (also the principal) participated in the senior primary school class and has only participated in six sessions in the four months since the school was established, has never submitted homework, and rarely studies on his own. Shen Chunxu, the Secretary of the Anci County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, did not participate in learning at all. Among the thirty-three section and bureau-level cadres who participated in cultural learning, very few regularly attended school, and they adopted a perfunctory attitude towards learning. Because most leading cadres do not pay attention to learning and do not abide by the learning system, it affects the general cadres' perfunctory attitude towards learning. Therefore, although the school committee has repeatedly resolved on the leave system, it cannot be implemented. Since the state has taken so much trouble and spent money to run amateur schools, hoping that they will study hard so that they can do a good job in the people's affairs, it is very wrong for them to treat learning like this. We suggest that the Anci County People's Government and the Anci County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party should immediately take effective measures to rectify the amateur school and review the reasons for the above situation to consolidate the cultural learning of the organs' cadres in the future.

　　安次县业余学校为啥搞不好？
    ——领导干部不重视文化学习、不遵守制度是主要原因。
    河北省安次县机关干部文化补习学校于去年九月开学，不到三个星期，学员的情绪就逐渐松懈，人数一天天减少。县级十八个部门中应参加学习的有三百五十六人，现每天到校者仅百人左右。除下乡工作和有特殊事情者外，不少人有学习时间也不参加学习。产生以上现象的原因，主要是县级领导干部忽视文化学习，未能以身作则。如县长史洪涛（兼校长）参加高小班，在建校以来的四个月中仅参加过六次学习，从未交过作业，自己也很少自修；中共安次县委书记沈春旭根本没有参加学习；在参加文化学习的三十三名科、股长级干部中，经常到校的很少，他们对学习采取应付态度。由于大多数领导干部不重视学习，不遵守学习制度，影响到一般干部对学习也马虎起来。所以，校委会对请假制度虽一再决议，也不能贯彻。国家既然这样费心，出钱来办业余学校，希望他们努力学习，好把人民的事情办好，而他们竟这样来对待学习，是十分不应该的。我们建议安次县人民政府及中共安次县委会，应立即采取有效措施，整顿业余学校，并对产生以上情况的原因做出检讨，以巩固今后机关干部的文化学习。
