　　Xinhua News Agency, 4th: Due to stable prices and the vigorous promotion by the People's Bank of China, the savings business of the People's Bank of China has greatly developed over the past year. The prize-winning savings programs held by the People's Banks in various regions in the past two months have been universally welcomed. As of the beginning of December last year, the total balance of savings deposits in the People's Bank of China nationwide increased ninefold compared to the end of the previous year. This has played a certain role in accumulating scattered funds for economic construction and stabilizing financial prices.
    After the liberation of Peiping and Tianjin, under the condition that the currency was still unstable, the People's Bank first launched real-value savings in major cities to protect the interests of depositors. After prices stabilized in March of last year, it immediately launched principal-protected, value-protected, and flexible savings, dispelling people's concerns about real-value savings due to falling prices, thereby greatly increasing the number of depositors. Many places also had a large number of depositors for one-year or even two-year fixed deposits. In Zhejiang Province, as of the end of November last year, the deposit balance of the People's Bank increased more than twelvefold compared to December of the previous year. In Tianjin, if the average deposit balance of the People's Bank in March of last year is taken as the base number, the balance on December 15th increased by more than 719 percent compared to March; the number of depositors also surged from more than 15,000 in March to more than 200,000 in mid-December.
    In order to further widely accumulate scattered idle funds and increase people's interest in savings, the People's Bank absorbed the experience of Soviet banks in promoting people's savings and launched "prize-winning fixed-term double-guaranteed savings" in various regions across the country two months ago. The characteristic of this type of savings is that it guarantees principal, has a short term, high prizes, and good interest rates, and is essentially completely different from the prize bonds issued in the past by the enemy and puppet regime, and is therefore welcomed by the broad masses of the people. Several rounds of prize-winning savings in Hebei Province, Beijing, and Tianjin, with hundreds of thousands of numbers, were all fully subscribed before the deadline. A total of 26.6 billion yuan in prize-winning savings deposits were collected nationwide in two months, providing a large amount of funds for national economic construction. Therefore, the People's Bank has decided to universally carry out this type of savings business in large, medium, and small cities this year.

　　全国各地人民银行储蓄业务迅速发展
    【新华社四日讯】由于物价稳定和人民银行的大力推行，一年来中国人民银行的储蓄业务有了很大的发展。最近两个月来各地人民银行举办的有奖储蓄，更普遍受到欢迎。截至去年十二月上旬止，中国人民银行全国储蓄存款总余额，较前年年底增加了九倍。这对积聚零散资金投入经济建设及稳定金融物价上都起了一定的作用。
    人民银行在平、津解放以后，在通货还不稳定的条件下，首先在各大城市举办了折实储蓄，以保障储户的利益。去年三月间物价稳定后，又立即开办了保本保值和定活两便储蓄，解除了人民因物价下落而产生的对折实储蓄的顾虑，因而使储户大大增加。许多地方一年甚至二年的定期储蓄也有了不少储户。在浙江省，截至去年十一月底止，人民银行存款余额较前年十二月增加达十二倍以上。在天津市，如以去年三月份人民银行的平均存款余额为基数，十二月十五日的余额即比三月份增加百分之七百十九以上；储户也由三月份的一万五千余户激增至十二月中旬的二十余万户。
    人民银行为进一步广泛积聚零星闲散资金，提高人民的储蓄兴趣，吸取了苏联银行推行人民储蓄的经验，在两个月前，先后在全国各地开办了“有奖定期双保储蓄”。这种储蓄的特点是能保本、期限短、奖额多、利息优，本质上完全不同于过去敌伪时代所发行的奖券，因此获得广大人民的欢迎。河北省、北京、天津两市先后举办的数期有奖储蓄数十万号都未到截止日期就都全部收储足额。全国两个月内共收储有奖储蓄存款共二百六十六亿元，为国家经济建设提供了很大一笔资金。因此人民银行决定今年在各大、中、小城市普遍开展这种储蓄业务。
