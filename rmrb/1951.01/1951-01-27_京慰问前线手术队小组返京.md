When they saw the letters and gifts of sympathy from the Mayor and Deputy Mayor of Beijing, the Director and Deputy Director of the Municipal Public Health Bureau, various organizations, and their family members, their emotions were very warm, and some even shed tears of excitement. They were extremely moved to hear that during the month or so they had been away from Beijing, the government and hospitals had sent people to visit their homes three times. They unanimously stated that they would work harder and respond to the concern and expectations of the higher authorities and the people of Beijing with practical actions.
