Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 3rd: According to TASS, Soviet Minister of Power Stations, Zhmerin, published an article in Pravda before the New Year titled "The Victory of the Soviet Electrical Industry," discussing the Soviet Union's victorious completion of the Five-Year Plan's electricity production targets. He stated that by the end of 1950, electricity production by Soviet power stations had increased by 47.2 billion kilowatt-hours. Electricity production in 1950 was almost one and a half times greater than in 1940. The Soviet Union now ranks second in the world in electricity production. Power stations that were damaged during the war, such as the powerful Dnieper Hydroelectric Station, as well as the large Zuyevka and Stalinogorsk thermal power stations, have been restored in a short period of time. The development of electricity production and the restoration of power stations in the postwar years have been carried out on the basis of the widespread adoption of advanced technologies. Soviet machine builders have quickly mastered the production of powerful steam turbines with capacities of 25,500 kilowatts and 100,000 kilowatts at high pressure, along with corresponding boilers and other equipment. The quality of the Soviet-made hydraulic turbines and generators installed at the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station is superior to that of similar machines made in the United States. During the postwar Five-Year Plan, automation and mechanization, as well as remote control devices, were widely implemented in power stations. By the end of 1950, 68 percent of the total generating capacity of hydroelectric power stations was automated.

　　苏联电气事业的胜利
    【新华社三日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联电站部部长日梅林，于新年前在真理报发表题为《苏联电气事业的胜利》的专文，论述苏联胜利完成战后五年计划的电力生产称：到一九五○年底，苏联电力站的电量增产了四十七亿二千万千瓦时。一九五○年电力生产比一九四○年几乎增加了一倍半。现在苏联的电力生产占世界第二位，战时曾遭破坏的发电站，如强大的第聂伯河水电站以及捷夫斯卡雅和斯大林哥尔斯卡雅两大热力发电站，均已在短期内修复。战后年代电力生产的发展和电力站的恢复，是在广泛采用先进技术的基础上进行的。苏联机器制造家在短期内就熟练地生产出具有二万五千五百千瓦和十万千瓦高压、并有着相应的汽锅和其他装备的强大蒸汽透平。装置在第聂伯河水电站的苏联制造的水力透平和发电机的品质，优于美国制造的同类机器。在战后五年计划中电力站广泛地实施了自动化和机械化以及远方操纵装置。到一九五○年底，水电站全部生产能力的百分之六十八已经自动化。
