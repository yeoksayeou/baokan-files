　　China's youth, with their glorious patriotic tradition, are responding to the great call of the motherland and enthusiastically enlisting in various military cadre schools, forming an unprecedented new upsurge of patriotism among Chinese youth. This patriotic upsurge will advance the Chinese youth movement to a new stage and greatly promote the patriotic movement of the entire nation. The infusion of this fresh blood of Chinese youth intellectuals and workers into the ranks of the long-tempered People's Liberation Army will undoubtedly greatly strengthen our people's strength to defend the motherland and consolidate world peace.
    This movement demonstrates that the political awareness of Chinese youth after liberation has been unprecedentedly enhanced under the direct leadership and education of the Chinese Communist Party and its capable assistant, the Chinese New Democratic Youth League. It also demonstrates the mutual trust and love between the People's Government and the youth and people of the whole country. Throughout the country, many patriotic parents are sending their children to military cadre schools; countless young people across the country are impatiently vying to sign up to become "Chairman Mao's soldiers." This is unprecedented. In the era of reactionary rule, patriotism was considered "guilty," so that Chinese youth could only rely on bare hands and passionate hearts to express their love for their great motherland through strikes, work stoppages, and demonstrations for a long time. Now, the People's Government fully trusts the youth and hands over modern weapons to the youth to master. This close relationship between the government and the youth is one of the sources of the invincible power of the people's China.
    The noble patriotic actions of the young people who bravely responded to the call of the motherland and are embarking on glorious posts are being respected and praised by the people of the whole country. Glory belongs to them. However, as patriotic military cadres, they still need to continue to train, because what they will shoulder is the great task of armed defense of the motherland; they are now entering the People's Military Cadre School with iron discipline and strict organization; their "August 1st" cap badges mark the People's Liberation Army's tradition of arduous struggle and heroic struggle. Therefore, what they need to prepare to do now is to strictly exercise their arduousness and organization. This will become the primary course that young soldiers currently enlisting need to learn. More than 50 percent of them are Communist Party members and Youth League members, who have already actively played a leading role in promoting and consolidating this movement in this enrollment, and should play a more backbone role in future national defense construction.
    At present, the young people who remain in schools and factories have also further established a view of life of serving the motherland and the people through this movement, and have more correctly solved problems such as future, family, and personal safety, thereby generating the determination and courage to respond to the call of the motherland at any time. This is a great harvest for both individuals and the motherland. Some young people, due to quota limitations, registered but were not approved for admission, and some unease arose, which is unnecessary. Although the position of national defense construction is the most glorious position for young people to serve the motherland, it is not the only position. The position of national defense construction cannot accommodate all young people. It is extremely natural and appropriate for most young students and young workers to remain in schools and factories. Other glorious positions for building the motherland are waiting for the vast number of young people to participate. At present, young people in schools and factories should concentrate on learning, actively produce, and continue to work hard to improve their political awareness. There are still many arduous and great tasks waiting for you in the anti-imperialist patriotic movement!

### 中国青年爱国主义的新高潮

　　中国青年爱国主义的新高潮
    有着光荣的爱国主义传统的中国青年，响应祖国的伟大号召，踊跃报名参加各种军事干部学校，形成了中国青年空前的爱国主义的新高潮。这个爱国主义的新高潮，将推进中国青年运动到一个新的阶段，同时也将大大促进全国人民的爱国运动。中国青年知识分子和工人的这种新鲜血液注入久经锻炼的人民解放军的队伍中去，无疑的将大大加强我国人民保卫祖国与巩固世界和平的力量。
    这一运动说明了解放后的中国青年，在中国共产党及其有力助手中国新民主主义青年团的直接领导与教育下，政治觉悟已空前提高。它更表现了人民政府与全国青年和全国人民之间的相互信赖与热爱。在全国范围内，许多爱国的家长，遣送子女参加军事干部学校；全国各地无数青年都迫不及待地争先报名，要做“毛主席的战士”。这是史无前例的。在反动势力统治时代，爱国被认为是“有罪”的，以致中国青年曾长期地只能凭着赤手空拳和满腔热血，用罢课、罢工、游行来表达自己对于伟大祖国的热爱。现在，人民政府充分信赖着青年，把现代化的武装交给青年来掌握。政府与青年这一亲密无间的关系，是人民中国无敌力量的泉源之一。
    勇敢地响应了祖国号召、正走上光荣岗位的青年们的高尚的爱国主义行动，正受到全国人民的尊敬与赞美。光荣是属于他们的。但是，作为一个爱国的军事干部来说，他们还需要继续锻炼，因为他们所将要担负的，是武装保卫祖国的伟大任务；他们现在所进入的，是有着铁的纪律与严密组织的人民军事干部学校；他们的“八一”帽徽标志着人民解放军艰苦卓绝、英勇奋斗的传统。因而他们目前首先要准备做到的，是严格锻炼自己的艰苦性与组织性。这将成为现在入伍的青年战士们所需要学习的首要课程。他们之中约占百分之五十以上的共产党员与青年团员，在此次报名中已经积极地发挥了推动与巩固这一运动的带头作用，在今后国防建设中还应当更加发挥骨干的作用。
    目前留在学校、工厂中的青年们，通过这次运动，也进一步树立了为祖国、为人民服务的人生观，比较正确地解决了前途、家庭与个人安危等问题，从而产生了随时准备响应祖国号召的决心与勇气。这无论对于个人、对于祖国来说都是一种极大的收获。有些青年因受名额限制，报了名未被批准入学，就产生某些不安情绪，这是不必要的。国防建设的岗位虽然是青年们为祖国服务的最光荣的岗位，但它并不是唯一的岗位。国防建设岗位也不可能容纳全部青年。大部分青年学生、青年工人留在学校里、工厂里是极其自然也是极其应当的。建设祖国的其他光荣岗位正等待着广大青年去参加。目前在学校、在工厂中的青年们，应该潜心学习，积极生产，继续努力提高政治觉悟，在反帝爱国主义的运动中还有很多艰巨而伟大的任务在等待着你们！
