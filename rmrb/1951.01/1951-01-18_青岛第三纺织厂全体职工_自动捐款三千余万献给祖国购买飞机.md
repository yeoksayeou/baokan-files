　　All Workers of Qingdao No. 3 Textile Factory
    Voluntarily Donate Over 30 Million
    To the Motherland to Purchase Airplanes
    [Our Dispatch] To strengthen national defense and safeguard the security of the motherland, all workers of the state-owned Qingdao No. 3 Cotton Textile Factory, led by all the workers of the factory's Machinery Section, voluntarily donated their 1950 year-end bonuses, one day's earnings, to the motherland to purchase airplanes. After hearing the news that the worker brothers in Shanghai were donating airplanes for the purpose of resisting America and aiding Korea, all the workers of the Machinery Section, under the call of the workshop committee, wanted to emulate the worker brothers in Shanghai and voluntarily took the lead in donating one day's bonus to buy airplanes for the motherland. Initially, they decided that only formal workers would donate, but this was opposed by the temporary workers. Temporary workers Xu Yanjie, Su Shimin, and others said excitedly, "Are you formal workers patriotic, and we temporary workers don't want to be patriotic?!" The temporary workers, like the formal workers, all donated one day's bonus. Subsequently, the workshop trade union reported the situation of this spontaneous movement to the factory trade union and proposed to challenge the brothers and sisters of the entire factory. After the factory trade union announced this news in a quick report, it quickly spread to all workshops in the factory. All the workers in the factory did not want to fall behind others and unanimously responded to this call. Except for a few workers with particularly difficult family situations, all voluntarily donated one day's bonus, totaling over 32 million RMB, fully demonstrating the Chinese working class's love for the motherland.

　　青岛第三纺织厂全体职工
    自动捐款三千余万       
    献给祖国购买飞机
    【本报讯】国营青岛第三棉纺织厂全体职工，为加强国防建设，保卫祖国安全，在该厂机动课全体职工的带头下，自动将一九五○年年终奖金，捐出一天所得，献给祖国购买飞机。该厂机动课全体职工，听到上海的工人弟兄为了抗美援朝而捐献飞机的消息后，在车间委员会的号召下，大家均要向上海工人弟兄看齐，自愿带头捐献一天的奖金，给祖国买飞机。最初他们决定只是正式工才捐献，但是遭到了临时工的反对。临时工徐延杰、苏世民等激动地说：“你们正式工爱国，难道我们临时工就不要爱国了吗！？”临时工也和正式工一样，都捐献了一天的奖金。随后该部车间工会，即将这个自发运动的情况报告厂工会，并提出向全厂的弟兄姊妹们挑战。厂工会将这个消息在快报上公布以后，很快地传遍了全厂各个车间。全厂职工都不愿落在别人后面，一致响应了这一号召。除个别因家庭特别困难的职工外，都自愿捐献了一天奖金，共计人民币三千二百余万元，充分表示了中国工人阶级对祖国的热爱。
