The Farmers' Associations, which are currently leading the vast number of peasants in newly liberated areas in rent reduction or land reform movements, have, according to incomplete statistics from the four major administrative regions of East China, Central and South China, Southwest China, and Northwest China, already have 6.6 million members. This organized peasant force, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, is a powerful guarantee for the rapid completion of the anti-feudal revolution in the countryside, and also the cornerstone for consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship in the countryside.

This peasant force was basically established in struggle last year, and has grown and been consolidated in struggle. The peasants in most areas of East China and Central and South China began to be universally and partially organized from a series of struggles such as suppressing bandits, opposing local bullies, collecting grain (opposing unfair burdens), and reducing rent in the winter of 1949 and the spring of 1950. Last spring, the Zhejiang Provincial Farmers' Association already had more than 3 million members, southern Jiangsu had more than 900,000, and Fujian Province had more than 700,000. Last spring, the provinces of Henan, Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi in Central and South China carried out large-scale rent reduction movements. Half of Henan Province also implemented land reform last spring. Therefore, the development of the Farmers' Associations in the above provinces was even more rapid. Henan Province, which completed land reform in 43 counties last spring, had more than 7 million Farmers' Association members in July last year. Including the other half of the area where rent was reduced, the total reached more than 9 million. Hunan Province had more than 5 million, and Hubei Province had more than 4 million. The Southwest and Northwest were liberated later, and the Farmers' Associations in most areas only began to organize last spring. According to incomplete statistics from the Southwest region as of July last year, there were already 2.5 million Farmers' Association members. In the new areas of Shaanxi and Gansu provinces in the Northwest region, there were also more than 1 million. In the first half of last year, most counties in East China and Central and South China had convened one to several county Farmers' Representative Conferences, and elected and established county Farmers' Association committees. Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Zhejiang and other provinces had successively convened provincial Farmers' Representative Conferences, and elected and established provincial Farmers' Association committees or preparatory committees.

The Farmers' Association takes farm laborers and poor peasants as its backbone, unites middle peasants, handicraft workers in the countryside, and poor revolutionary intellectuals in the countryside, becoming the main force against feudalism in the countryside, and the main reliance and assistant for the People's Government in destroying the old ruling institutions and establishing the people's democratic dictatorship in the new rural areas. In the early days of liberation, they actively prepared grain and grass to support the People's Liberation Army in pursuing and annihilating the Chiang bandits; they actively helped suppress bandits during bandit suppression; and actively paid public grain during grain collection, and struggled to ensure fair burdens and complete grain collection. For the past year, relying on the Farmers' Association, the policies and decrees of the People's Government have been successfully implemented in the new rural areas.

Because the Farmers' Association developed rapidly, the improvement of peasants' political awareness was still limited, and landlords were engaged in sabotage activities, it was discovered last summer that there was a fairly common phenomenon of impure elements within the Farmers' Association organizations in various places. Many township Farmers' Associations had agents of the landlord class, hooligans, or rich peasant elements mixed in, and even landlord elements mixed in; and a very small number of township Farmers' Associations were organized by landlords who sent their agents, with the purpose of protecting the interests of the landlord class, preserving feudal forces, and resisting the peasant movement. After the promulgation of the Land Reform Law of the People's Republic of China and the General Rules for the Organization of Farmers' Associations, East China and Central and South China, in order to prepare for the implementation of land reform, began to vigorously rectify the grassroots organizations of the Farmers' Association, and demanded further development from consolidation. The Farmers' Associations in the Southwest were also beginning to carry out rectification in the process of vigorous development. The purpose of the rectification is mainly to cleanse impure elements mixed in the Farmers' Association, improve the leadership of the township Farmers' Association with farm laborers and poor peasants as the core and the participation of middle peasants, and conduct political education for the masses of members. The rectification method generally adopted is to combine with the work in the rural areas at that time, mobilize the peasant masses, and engage in resolute and prudent cleansing; strengthen the core role of farm laborers and poor peasants in the leadership, but at the same time emphasize that representatives of a certain proportion of middle peasant members must participate. For some township Farmers' Association cadres whose style was unsatisfactory to the masses, they were educated by carrying out criticism and self-criticism, which resulted in improving the relationship between cadres and the masses. Even for the fake Farmers' Associations organized by landlord agents, the peasants were mobilized to carry out cleansing and reorganize the leadership, rather than completely negating them.

After the rectification and development in the summer and autumn of last year, the strength of the Farmers' Associations in most areas of East China, Central and South China, and Southwest China, and some areas of Northwest China has been further strengthened, and hundreds of thousands and millions of peasants in various places have joined the Farmers' Association during this period. During this period, most counties in the Southwest and Northwest also convened county Farmers' Representative Conferences and established county Farmers' Association committees. All provinces and administrative regions have established provincial Farmers' Association committees or preparatory committees. According to incomplete statistics as of November last year, the Farmers' Association members in the six provinces of Central and South China reached 28 million, East China reached 24 million, and the Southwest reached more than 8 million. According to statistics as of September last year, the number of Farmers' Association members in the new areas of Shaanxi and Gansu provinces in the Northwest had also increased to 1.35 million. Now, land reform movements and rent reduction movements are being widely carried out in various places, and the Farmers' Associations in various places are also being further strengthened and developed in the movements. For example, in the townships in the Guanzhong area of Shaanxi Province where land reform is currently being carried out, the Farmers' Association members generally accounted for only less than 10% of the population at the beginning of land reform, but now they generally account for 25% of the agricultural population, and up to 50% in some cases.

　　全国农民协会组织日益壮大
    目前正在领导广大新解放区农民从事减租或土地改革运动的农民协会，据华东、中南、西南、西北四大行政区不完全的统计，现已拥有会员六千数百万人。这一支有组织的农民队伍，在中国共产党的领导下，是迅速完成农村反封建革命的有力保证，也是巩固农村人民民主专政的基石。
    这一支农民队伍，基本上是在去年一年内，从斗争中建立，并从斗争中成长壮大和巩固起来的。华东和中南的大部地区的农民，在一九四九年冬和一九五○年春，就已从剿匪、反恶霸、征粮（反负担不公）、减租等一系列的斗争中开始普遍地部分地组织起来了。去年春天，浙江省农民协会就已有会员三百多万，苏南区有九十多万，福建省有七十多万。中南豫、鄂、湘、赣等省去春曾进行大规模的减租运动，河南省的一半地区在去春并实行了土地改革，因此上述各省农民协会的发展就更为迅速。河南省去春完成了土地改革的四十三个县，去年七月统计已有农民协会会员七百多万，加上另一半减租的地区共达九百多万，湖南省五百多万，湖北省四百多万。西南和西北解放较迟，大部地区的农民协会去春才开始组织。西南区截至去年七月份为止的不完全统计，已有农民协会会员二百五十万；西北区陕西省和甘肃省的新区，亦已有一百多万。去年上半年，华东和中南大部分县就已召开过一次到数次县农民代表会议，选举和成立了县农民协会委员会；河南、湖北、湖南、浙江等省且已先后召开了全省农民代表会议，选举和成立了省农民协会委员会或筹委会。
    农民协会以雇农和贫农为其骨干，团结了中农和农村中的手工业工人，以及农村中贫苦的革命知识分子，成为农村中反封建的主力，成为人民政府在新区农村中摧毁旧的统治机构，建立人民民主专政的主要依靠和助手。他们在初解放时，积极筹备粮草，支援人民解放军追歼蒋匪；在剿匪时积极帮助剿匪；在征粮时积极缴纳公粮，并为保证负担公平，为完成征粮而进行斗争。一年以来，依靠了农民协会，人民政府的政策法令，得以在新区农村中顺利推行。
    因为农民协会发展较快，农民政治觉悟的提高还有一定的限制，加以地主又从事破坏活动，去年夏天，各地即发现农民协会组织内部，存在相当普遍的成份不纯的现象。不少乡农民协会有地主阶级的代理人、流氓分子或富农分子混入，甚至有地主分子混入；还有极少数乡农民协会，是地主派遣其代理人组织的，目的在保护地主阶级的利益，保存封建势力，抵抗农民运动。中华人民共和国土地改革法和农民协会组织通则相继颁布后，华东和中南各地，为着准备实行土地改革，开始大力整顿农民协会的基层组织，并要求从巩固中求得进一步的发展。西南各地的农民协会，也在大力发展的过程中开始进行整顿。整顿的目的主要是清洗混入农会的不纯分子，健全以雇农贫农为核心并有中农参加的乡农民协会的领导机构，并向会员群众进行政治教育。整顿方法，一般采取结合当时农村中的工作，发动农民群众，从事坚决而慎重的清洗；加强领导机构中的雇农贫农核心作用，但同时强调必须有一定比例的中农会员的代表参加。对于某些在作风上为群众所不满的乡农民协会干部，则以开展批评和自我批评的方法，加以教育，结果是改善了干部和群众的关系。对于即使是由地主代理人所组织的假农会，也从是发动农民进行清洗和改组领导来加以整顿的，而不是全部否定。
    经过去年夏秋两季的整顿和发展，目前华东、中南、西南大部地区和西北部分地区的农民协会的力量都已进一步地加强，各地又有成十万成百万的农民，在此期间加入了农民协会。在此期间，西南和西北的各县也大部召开过县农民代表会议，成立了县农民协会委员会，所有各省各行政区，都成立了省农民协会委员会或筹委会的机构。截至去年十一月份的不完全统计，中南六省的农民协会会员已达二千八百万，华东达二千四百万，西南达八百万人以上。西北陕西、甘肃两省新区据截至去年九月份止的统计，农民协会会员亦已增至一百三十五万人。现在，各地土地改革运动和减租运动正在广泛展开，各地农民协会在运动中也在进一步加强和发展。例如陕西省关中地区现正进行土地改革的各乡，在开始土地改革时，农民协会会员一般仅占人口百分之十以下，现在一般已占农业人口的百分之二十五，最高达百分之五十以上。
