Xinhua News Agency, 10th: The Northeast Daily published a letter on the 7th from Yu Lie, a staff member of an engineering company of our Chinese People's Volunteer Army. The letter detailed the scene in which the company was warmly welcomed by local Korean people when they were ordered to open up mountains and roads for the attacking troops in a certain area of Korea, and the great friendship between the Chinese and Korean people.

The author wrote: We arrived at our destination at six o'clock in the morning. As soon as we got off the bus, we were warmly welcomed and cordially entertained by the local Korean people. They gave us all the few houses that had not been burned down by American planes. The Korean villagers treated us like long-lost relatives, and they complained to us one after another about the atrocities of the American invading army. These Korean villagers have had their homes destroyed by American planes, and many of them currently have no cotton clothes to wear and no food to eat. Many children followed us and cried from the cold. At this time, many of our comrades gave their sweaters, cotton trousers, shirts, and shoes to the Korean villagers.

After we started working, the Korean villagers automatically helped us to heat the water for washing our faces every morning; after meals, they competed to wash the bowls; after we came back from work, they had already boiled the water. Comrade Yu Lianyun, the deputy squad leader, was sick, and the landlord, an old man, made porridge for him to drink, and the old woman cooked melon for him to eat. They asked him about his health every day, boiled water, and gave him medicine, taking care of him even more attentively than his own parents.

Our comrades, filled with hatred for American imperialism and infinite love for the Korean people, further increased their enthusiasm for combat and labor. In the assault mission, we overcame many difficulties, and each squad and team launched a competition. Comrade Zhang Fadong, who was a blacksmith by trade, had experience and strength in hammering. He hammered hundreds of times in one breath. Many comrades had blisters on their hands, and some had frostbite on their hands and feet, but they still insisted on working. American planes continued to harass us, but no one paid attention to them. In just thirteen days, we opened up a new road in the mountains and successfully completed the task.

Xinhua News Agency, 10th: Our correspondent on the Korean front reports: The wounded soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army who are recovering in the rear hospitals have expressed their deep gratitude for the care given to them by the Korean people. Although the Korean people are living in extreme poverty under the ravages of the American aggressors, every time the wounded soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army pass through a village on their way back to the rear, the local people always try their best to give them all kinds of care. As soon as the wounded soldiers enter the house, the people immediately give up the warm kang. Many grandmothers and grandfathers even stay up all night to cook soup and boil water for them. On the way, American planes often come to harass and attack, but thanks to the careful concealment of the Korean people, the wounded soldiers can finally reach the rear safely.

When the wounded soldiers Hou Zhende and others passed through Wenfeng-ri, Ningbyon County, an eighty-year-old man named Liu voluntarily offered them accommodation and kindly inquired about their injuries. Seeing that the wounded soldiers had difficulty with bowel movements, he tried to find some canned food boxes for them to use as urinals, and specially took out a bottle of long-stored honey and insisted that they taste it.

The wounded soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army are also receiving the cordial care of the Korean People's Army. When Korean People's Army drivers see wounded soldiers of our Volunteer Army on the road, they always stop the car specially, and if they are going the same way, they help them into the car. On his way back to the rear, the wounded soldier Sun Yiyuan met a female doctor named Bai Honggui from the Korean "Kyongsong Hospital." This female doctor immediately bandaged his right hand, which had been injured in the bombing. They stayed in the same town that night, and Bai Honggui came specially to look after him. The next day, Bai Honggui bought some apples and biscuits to send him. This kind of militant internationalist friendship moved Sun Yiyuan to tears.

　　朝人民热爱我志愿军
    【新华社十日讯】东北日报于七日刊载我国人民志愿军某部工兵连工作人员于埒的一封信。信中详述该连奉命在朝鲜某地为进攻部队开山凿道时，受到当地朝鲜人民热烈欢迎的情景，与中、朝人民间亲密团结的伟大友谊。
    作者写道：早晨六点钟我们到达目的地，刚一下车，就受到当地朝鲜老百姓热烈的欢迎与殷勤的招待。他们把仅有的几间未被美机焚毁的房屋都让给我们住。朝鲜老乡们对待我们如同久别重逢的亲人一样，纷纷向我们控诉美国侵略军的兽行。这些朝鲜老乡们由于家产都被美机毁坏了，目前许多人没有棉衣穿，没有粮食吃。有许多小孩跟着来看我们，被冻得直哭。这时我们有许多同志都纷纷把自己的绒衣、绒裤、衬衣和鞋袜等，送给朝鲜老乡们。
    我们开始工作后，朝鲜老乡们每天早晨都自动帮我们烧洗脸水；饭后他们争着给刷碗盆；我们作业回来后，他们早就把开水烧好了。一班副于连云同志病了，房东老大爷给做粥喝，老大娘给熬瓜吃，每天问寒问暖，烧水、送药，简直比自己的父母照顾得还周到。
    同志们就在这种充满对美帝国主义的仇恨与对朝鲜人民无限热爱的心绪支配下，更提高了战斗与劳动的积极性。在突击任务中，我们克服了重重困难，各班各组都展开竞赛。张发东同志是铁匠出身，打锤有经验，有力量，他一气就是几百锤，许多同志手上磨起血泡，有的冻坏了手脚，还是坚持工作。美机不断来扰乱，谁也没有理会。在短短的十三天中，我们就在崇山峻岭中开辟出一条新的道路，胜利地完成了任务。
    【新华社十日讯】本社朝鲜战地记者报道：在后方医院中养伤的中国人民志愿军伤员，对于朝鲜人民给他们的照顾，都表示深切的感谢。虽然朝鲜人民在美国侵略者的蹂躏下，生活极为困苦，但是，在中国人民志愿军的伤员运回后方途中，每经过一个乡村，当地人民总是想尽方法，给他们各种照顾。伤员一进屋，老百姓马上就把热炕让出来，有许多大娘和大爷，甚至昼夜不眠地给他们熬汤，烧水。途中，美国飞机常来骚扰袭击，也由于朝鲜人民的细心掩蔽，伤员们终于能安全地到达后方。
    伤员侯振德等三人在路过宁边县文峰里时，有一位八十多岁的刘老大爷自动留他们住宿，亲切地询问他们的伤势。他看到伤员大小便不方便，就设法找了些罐头盒子给他们当便器，并特地拿出一瓶久藏的蜂蜜，非要他们尝尝不可。
    中国人民志愿军的伤员同样受到朝鲜人民军亲切的照顾。朝鲜人民军的汽车司机在路上看到我志愿军伤员时，都特意停下车来，如果是顺路，就把他们扶上汽车。伤员孙一元在回后方途中，遇到朝鲜“京城医院”的一位女医生白洪桂。这位女医生马上替他包扎被炸伤的右手。晚上他们住在同一个镇子里，白洪桂又特地来看护他。第二天，白洪桂又买了些苹果、饼干送来。这种战斗的国际主义友爱，曾使孙一元感动得流泪。
