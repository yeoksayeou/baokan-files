Xinhua News Agency, New York, 27th: The United Nations General Assembly Political Committee held a meeting on the 25th. The first speaker was Indian representative Rau. Rau presented the proposal of the Arab and Asian twelve-nation group. The proposal stipulates that a conference of representatives from the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, the People's Republic of China, France, India, and Egypt should be convened to discuss the Korean issue and other Far Eastern issues. Rau requested that the Political Committee should vote on this proposal before voting on any other proposals because this proposal is merely an amendment to previously submitted proposals, and doing so is "logical."

British representative Jebb spoke after Rau, saying that he was not willing to express his opinion on the twelve-nation proposal at this time but only expressed his agreement with Rau's assertion that this proposal should be discussed as soon as possible.

Jebb then delivered a lengthy general statement, outlining and explaining the British government's policy on the Korean issue and on the issue of the status of the People's Republic of China. Jebb specifically mentioned Attlee's statement in the House of Commons on January 23rd, that the British government had not abandoned hope of resolving the Korean War through negotiation. Jebb repeated the claim that China was "engaged in aggression." He said that it was necessary to continue studying the possibility of a solution. At the same time, he spoke to make a blatant defense of American aggression in Korea. Jebb then analyzed what the British government believed to be an acceptable basis for a solution. He said that the government of the People's Republic of China should be recognized as effectively controlling China and that it should be allowed to participate in the United Nations.

Jebb said that Britain supports the first five points of the American proposal, including the point of declaring China an "aggressor." However, it opposes taking any action to implement collective measures against China.

Next, Philippine representative Romulo spoke. He demanded that the committee currently only adopt the American proposal. New Zealand representative Berendsen also demanded the adoption of the American proposal.

At this point, Soviet representative Tsarapkin said: "Many people have at least begun to understand the fatal danger of the policy imposed on the United Nations by the United States. Many member states of the United Nations have realized that it is necessary to seek ways to peacefully resolve the Korean and Far Eastern issues; it is precisely for this purpose that telegrams were begun to be exchanged with the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, asking it to clarify its proposals for a peaceful resolution of these issues. We have received some responses to these questions, including the proposals of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China—the date of the last proposal being January 17th.

"The Soviet delegation supports the proposals of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, believing that these proposals are suitable for quickly resolving the Korean issue and some issues related to the People's Republic of China and the Far East by peaceful means.

"Not only the Soviet delegation but also the delegations of other countries have pointed out here that the proposals of the government of the People's Republic of China should be given the most serious attention, and these proposals pave the way for the earliest possible peaceful resolution of the Korean and other Far Eastern issues. The American position, on the other hand, is diametrically opposed to this; it is trying to aggravate the situation and put forward a proposal aimed at expanding the war under the banner of the United Nations.

"Regarding the revised proposal of the twelve Asian countries, the Soviet delegation considers it necessary to point out that this proposal is obviously flawed because it does not include several important points of the proposal of the government of the People's Republic of China. However, the Soviet Union does not object to the adoption of this proposal (although it is flawed) because it hopes that some of the measures stipulated in this proposal will lead to a peaceful resolution of the situation in the Far East.

"The Soviet delegation and other delegations have stated here with facts who is the real aggressor in Korea. They proved that it was the United States that carried out armed intervention in the internal affairs of Korea on June 27, 1950, and carried out acts of aggression in Korea.

"This is an undeniable fact, which everyone must pay attention to, and no one has the right to distort it.

"In view of this, the Soviet Union believes that it is necessary to propose an amendment to the proposal of the twelve Asian countries, deleting the first sentence in the title of the proposal, namely: 'Interference in Korea by the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China,' because this does not conform to the facts.

"The Soviet delegation also believes that it is appropriate to make the following minor amendment to the proposal of the twelve Asian countries: after the words 'determined by the Chairman of the General Assembly' in the last section, add 'with the consent of the participants in the meeting.'"

Chilean representative echoed the American demand to condemn China.

The last speaker was Egyptian representative Fawzi. He said that the presentation of the American proposal was untimely and that this proposal would not promote a peaceful resolution of the conflict. He emphasized that efforts should be made to seek reconciliation in the future, and this should never be obstructed.

The meeting was adjourned at this point.

　　阿拉伯和亚洲十二国向联大政委会提出提案
    主张召开七国代表会议
    讨论朝鲜以及远东问题
    苏联代表支持我国建议并对十二国提案提出部分修正          
    【新华社二十七日讯】塔斯社纽约二十七日讯：联合国大会政治委员会于二十五日举行会议。第一个发言者是印度代表劳氏。劳氏提出了阿拉伯和亚洲十二国集团的提案。该提案规定召开美国、苏联、英国、中华人民共和国、法国、印度和埃及七国代表会议，以讨论朝鲜问题以及其他远东问题。劳氏要求：政治委员会应在表决任何其他提案以前，先表决这个提案。因为这个提案只是以前提出的提案的修正案，而且这样做是“合乎逻辑的”。
    英国代表杰伯在劳氏之后发言说：他现在不愿对十二国提案表示意见，只表示同意劳氏的主张，即：这个提案应尽先讨论。
    杰伯继而发表长篇的一般性的声明，陈述并解释英国政府在朝鲜问题上以及在有关中华人民共和国地位问题上的政策。杰伯特别提到艾德礼于一月二十三日在下院的声明，即英政府并未放弃通过谈判以解决朝鲜战争的希望。杰伯把所谓中国“从事侵略”的说法重述一遍。他说，继续研究解决的可能性是必要的。同时，他又发言为美国在朝鲜的侵略作狂妄的辩护。杰伯继而分析英国政府认为什么是可以接受的解决的基础。他说：应该承认中华人民共和国政府有效地控制着中国，而准许它参加联合国。
    杰伯说：英国拥护美国提案中头五点，包括宣布中国为“侵略者”一点在内。但是，它反对采取任何行动对中国实行集体措施。
    接着，菲律宾代表罗慕洛发言。他要求目前委员会只通过美国的提案。新西兰代表比林德森也要求通过美国提案。
    至此，苏联代表查拉普金说：“许多人至少已经开始了解美国所强加于联合国的政策的致命危险。联合国许多会员国已经认识到必须寻觅途径，以和平解决朝鲜与远东问题；正是为了这个目的，才开始和中华人民共和国中央人民政府通电报，请它阐明它关于和平解决这些问题的建议。我们接到对于这些问题的一些答复，其中包括中华人民共和国中央人民政府的建议——最后一个建议的日期是一月十七日。
    “苏联代表团支持中华人民共和国中央人民政府的建议，认为这些建议适于迅速地以和平办法解决朝鲜问题以及与中华人民共和国及远东有关的一些问题。
    “不仅苏联代表团，还有其他各国的代表团也都在这里指出：中华人民共和国政府的建议应该受到最认真的注意，这些建议为尽早达到朝鲜与其他远东问题的和平解决开辟了道路。而美国的立场则与此针锋相对，它力图促使形势更加严重，并且提出以在联合国旗帜之下扩大战争为目的的提案。
    “关于修正后的十二个亚洲国家的提案，苏联代表团认为有必要指出：这个提案显然是不妥善的，因为它没有把中华人民共和国政府建议中的若干重要点包括进去。但是，苏联不反对通过这个提案（虽然它是不妥善的），因为希望这个提案中所规定的一些措施，能够使得远东形势得到和平解决。
    “苏联代表团及其他代表团在这里以事实来说明谁是真正对朝鲜的侵略者。它们证明：一九五○年六月二十七日实行武装干涉朝鲜内政，在朝鲜进行侵略行为的正是美国。
    “这是一个无可否认的事实，任何人都必须予以重视，任何人都没有权利歪曲这一事实。
    “有鉴于此，苏联认为有必要对十二个亚洲国家的提案提出修正案，删去提案标题中第一句，即：‘中华人民共和国中央人民政府干涉朝鲜’一句，因为这不符合事实。
    “苏联代表团并认为：宜于在十二个亚洲国家的提案中，作下列小的修正：在最后一节‘由大会主席确定’等字样之后，增加“在会议参加者的同意之下”等字。”
    智利代表随声附和美国谴责中国的要求。
    最后发言的是埃及代表法齐。他说：美国提案的提出是不合时宜的，这个提案并不能促进冲突的和平解决。他强调说：将来也应努力谋求和解，对于这一点绝不应加以阻挠。
    会议至此宣告休会。
