　　The Friendship of the Chinese and Korean Peoples in Battle
    ——A Record of the Return of the Korean Peace Envoy, Park Chung-hee
    Lù Bǐ
    On December 28, 1950, at the border town of Manzhouli in the motherland, the weather was extremely cold, reaching minus 30 degrees Celsius. However, everyone’s heart was warm, because the Korean Peace Envoy, Park Chung-hee, arrived in Manzhouli after returning from the Second World Peace Congress. Everyone here was eager to meet this outstanding Korean women’s leader.
    She happily accepted this request and gave a report on the Second World Peace Congress at a meeting of cadres in Manzhouli. In her report, she clearly told everyone that the Chinese and Korean peoples are truly as close as flesh and blood. She cited many ironclad facts to prove the actual actions of the Chinese and Korean peoples loving each other. She said that just when the Korean people were encountering extremely dangerous disasters, the great Chinese People's Volunteer Army came. The Volunteer Army’s high degree of internationalism and patriotism encouraged the Korean people. The Volunteer Army, regardless of bloodshed and sacrifice, jointly defeated the ferocious American invading army with the Korean people. She enthusiastically raised her hand and said: “Comrades! The Korean people are grateful to the heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army. Without the great assistance of the Volunteer Army, it would not have been easy for our country’s arduous anti-aggression war to achieve such great victories. The Volunteer Army’s great international spirit will never be forgotten by the Korean people.” Finally, she said with full confidence that the Korean War is not yet over; but the Korean people firmly believe that final victory will surely belong to the Korean people. Because they have two great, kind, and respectable loyal friends – the Soviet Union and China, whose loyal friendship encourages the Korean people to advance day and night...
    After her report, I went to the lounge to visit her. She was always happy and excited, with a very full spirit, without any sign of travel fatigue. I asked her to briefly introduce the situation of Korean women in the recent battles.
    She told me that Korean women have shown unprecedented bravery in this battle against the American aggressors; precisely because of this, Korean women have gained the concern of the people of the world; she said that wherever she went, people cared and asked about Korean women. This is not surprising, because Korean women are no different from soldiers defending their country with guns. From the first day of the battle, they completely dedicated themselves to the great motherland. Whether in the front or in the rear, they faced the cruel battle day and night. They enthusiastically performed any duty, whether large or small, sewing military uniforms, washing clothes, making military shoes, carrying stretchers, and rescuing wounded soldiers. They did everything that women could do. This is the same as the strength contributed by the vast number of Chinese women in the battle. As she said this, a proud smile appeared on her very happy face.
    Talking about female guerrillas, she added that the bravery of Korean female guerrillas is admirable. They relentlessly attacked the enemy. Difficulties and sacrifices are not a matter for them. They only know how to try to kill a few more enemies and never care about themselves. Therefore, to date, the number of female guerrillas is so large that it cannot be counted. Hundreds and thousands of them are emerging in the battle. She said that she left these female heroes two months ago, and it is difficult to estimate how many have been added now. Speaking of this, she excitedly said to me that Korean women are such tenacious women, becoming stronger as they fight.
    Finally, she said that the reason why the Korean representatives were so warmly welcomed at the Second World Peace Congress was not because of anything else, but because the Korean people had made a great contribution to the cause of peace cherished by the people of the world. She also confirmed that, even so, difficulties would not be easily resolved without the great assistance of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. She cited the battles of Xichuan and Dingchuan as good examples. The mad American imperialists attempted to kill and burn all the people of Dingchuan and Xichuan with cruel bombing and slaughter. Just when the Korean people were facing this difficult disaster, the great Chinese People's Volunteer Army came! They and the Korean People's Army repelled the American aggressors with brave and skilled assaults, allowing the people of Xichuan and Dingchuan to see the light of day again. In addition to being grateful to the Volunteer Army, the Korean people are willing to forever educate future generations of Korean people with this great spirit of internationalism.

　　中朝人民战斗的友谊
    ——记和大归来的朝鲜和平使者朴正爱
    路比
    一九五○年十二月二十八日，在祖国的边境满洲里，天气是这样的奇寒，到达零下三十余度，但是，今天每个人的心却是热腾腾的，因为朝鲜和平使者朴正爱自二届世界和大归来抵达满洲里。这里每个人都盼望着能认识一下这位优秀的朝鲜妇女领袖。
    她愉快地接受了这个请求，在满洲里的干部会议上作了关于二届世界和大的报告。在报告中，她明确地告诉大家，中朝人民确实是血肉相关的。她列举了许多铁的事实，证明中朝人民相亲相爱的实际行动。她说，正当朝鲜人民遭遇着非常险恶的灾难的时候，伟大的中国人民志愿军来了，志愿军的高度的国际主义与爱国主义精神鼓舞了朝鲜人民，志愿军不顾流血牺牲和朝鲜人民共同击败了凶恶的美国侵略军。她热情地举起手来说：“同志们！朝鲜人民感激英勇的中国人民志愿军，如果没有志愿军的伟大援助，我们祖国艰苦的反侵略战争，就不易获得如此巨大的胜利。志愿军这种伟大的国际精神使朝鲜人民永不忘记。”最后，她充满信心地说，朝鲜战争尚未结束；但朝鲜人民坚信，最后胜利一定属于朝鲜人民。因为他们有着两个伟大可亲可敬的忠实朋友——苏联和中国，他们的忠实友情，鼓舞着朝鲜人民日以继夜的在前进着……。
    她报告过后，我又去休息室中访问了她。她一直是愉快而又兴奋，精神非常饱满，毫无旅途的倦容。我请求她简单介绍最近战斗中的朝鲜妇女的情况。
    她告诉我，朝鲜妇女在这次反抗美国侵略者的战斗中，显示了她们空前未有的勇敢；正因为如此，朝鲜妇女获得了世界人民的关怀；她说，无论她走到那里，那里就有人关心地问到朝鲜妇女。这是不奇怪的，因为朝鲜妇女和持枪防卫祖国的战士没有两样，从战斗开始的第一天起，她们便把自己完全献给伟大的祖国。不管在前方在后方，她们日日夜夜艰苦地面对残酷的战斗。任何义务，无论大小，她们都热情地去做，缝军衣，洗衣服，做军鞋，抬担架，救护伤兵，凡是妇女能做的任何事情，她们都做到了。这和中国广大妇女在战斗中贡献出来的力量是一样的。她说到这里时，在她那非常愉快的脸上流露出骄傲的笑容。
    谈到女游击队员，她又补充说，朝鲜女游击队员的勇敢是令人佩服的。她们不停息地袭击敌人。困难和牺牲在她们的面前不算一回事。她们只懂得如何设法多杀几个敌人而从不计较自己。因此到目前为止，女游击队员的数目是多到无法统计的，成百成千的涌现在战斗中。她说，两个月前，她离开了这些女英雄，现在究竟又增加了多少？很难推算。谈到这里，她激动地向我说，朝鲜妇女就是这样顽强的女性，越战越坚强。
    最后她谈到在二届世界和平大会中，朝鲜代表所以受到特别热烈的欢迎，不是别的，而是朝鲜人民对全世界人民所珍爱的和平事业有着伟大的贡献。她又证实道，虽然如此，但是没有中国人民志愿军的伟大援助，困难还是不易解决的。她举例子说，熙川和定川的战斗就是一个很好的实例。疯狂的美帝企图用残酷的轰炸和屠杀，把定川熙川的人民杀光、烧光，正当朝鲜人民面临着这难以度过的灾难时，伟大的中国人民志愿军来了！他们和朝鲜人民军以勇敢的和熟练的冲锋战把美国侵略者击退，使得熙川、定川的人民重见天日。朝鲜人民除感激志愿军以外，并愿意永远地将这种伟大国际主义的精神去教育朝鲜人民的后代。
