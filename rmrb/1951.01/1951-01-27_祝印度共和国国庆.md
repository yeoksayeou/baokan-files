　　Congratulations on the National Day of the Republic of India
    January 26th is the National Day of the Republic of India. Chairman Mao Zedong of the Central People's Government and Premier and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai of the State Council sent messages of congratulations to Indian President Prasad and Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Nehru, respectively, on behalf of the government and people of the People's Republic of China. Chairman Mao Zedong also personally attended the Indian National Day celebration held in Beijing on the evening of the 26th by the Indian Ambassador to China, Panikkar.
    India, like China, is the largest country in Asia and one of the countries with the longest cultural history in the world. China and India are geographically adjacent, and cultural exchanges began as early as the Han Dynasty more than 2,000 years ago. There is a deep friendship between the people of the two countries. In modern times, both China and India suffered long-term aggression from Western capitalist countries. Therefore, the people of both countries have fought bravely and resolutely against aggression and for liberation in order to shake off the misfortune of their nations.
    Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the great Chairman Mao, the Chinese people overthrew the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and established a unified people's democratic state. The Republic of India and the People's Republic of China have established formal diplomatic relations on the basis of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for territorial sovereignty. This relationship will not only promote the growing development and consolidation of the friendship that already exists between the people of the two countries, but will also help to safeguard lasting peace in Asia and the world.
    The greatest characteristic of the current world situation is that the majority of people around the world demand peace and oppose the very few warmongers. The task of the people of Asia and the world is to unite and resolutely fight against warmongers. As we celebrate the National Day of the Republic of India, we earnestly hope that the friendship between the people of China and India, the two major countries, can strengthen this just struggle.

　　祝印度共和国国庆
    一月二十六日是印度共和国国庆日，我中央人民政府毛泽东主席与政务院周恩来总理兼外交部长曾分别致电印度总统普拉沙德及总理兼外交部长尼赫鲁，代表中华人民共和国政府及中国人民向印度政府和人民致贺。毛泽东主席并于二十六日晚亲自出席印度驻中国大使潘尼迦在北京所举行的印度国庆庆祝会。
    印度同中国一样，是亚洲的最大国家和世界上文化历史最悠久的国家。中印两国因为在地理上接壤，从两千多年前的汉朝即已开始了文化的交流。两国人民之间存在着深厚的友谊，在近代，中国和印度都遭受了西方资本主义国家的长期侵略，所以两国人民都曾为了挣脱自己民族的厄运，奋不顾身地进行了反对侵略、争取解放的坚决的斗争。
    中国人民在中国共产党和伟大的毛主席领导之下，推翻了帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的统治，建立了统一的人民民主的国家。印度共和国与中华人民共和国在平等、互利及互相尊重领土主权的基础建立了正式外交关系。这种关系，不仅将使已存在于两国人民之间的友谊日益发展和巩固，而且将有助于保卫亚洲与世界的持久和平。
    目前的世界形势的最大特点，是全世界大多数人民要求和平，而反对最少数的战争挑拨者。亚洲和世界人民的任务，即在于团结一致，坚决地为反对战争挑拨者而奋斗。我们在庆祝印度共和国国庆的时候，热烈地希望中国和印度两大国人民的友谊，能够加强这种正义的奋斗。
