Xinhua News Agency, New York, 20th: The United Nations General Assembly Political Committee meeting on January 18th continued to discuss the United States' slanderous case against China under the name of "The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China Interfering in Korea."

As previously reported, the Political Committee's previous meeting passed the so-called five principles proposed in the "Supplementary Report of the Korean Armistice Three-Person Committee," which have been transmitted by the United Nations Secretary-General to the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China.

On January 17th, the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China replied to these conditions by telegram. After the Chairman of the Political Committee read the full text of the reply, the United States representative, Austin, stood up and spoke. He used every method to accuse the government of the People's Republic of China, insisting that it was unwilling to take steps to end the war in Korea. Austin's speech was full of insults and threats to the Chinese people, as well as rabid attacks on the Soviet Union. Austin said that the United States government urged the United Nations to take "immediate and swift" action and insisted on passing a resolution condemning China that favored the United States. The Greek representative then spoke, demanding that action against China should not be limited to moral sanctions.

Afterwards, the Australian representative stated that the Chinese government's reply could not be accepted because "there are many reasons." However, he did not state any of these "reasons." The Australian representative concluded by urging the committee not to rush into making a decision on the issue under discussion, because the representatives needed time to "consult with each other and ask for instructions from their own governments."

The French representative also requested the Political Committee not to take rash measures, and he said: "The member states of the United Nations should not go to extremes."

The representatives of Belgium and the Philippines, as usual, attacked the government of the People's Republic of China.

The British representative said that the Chinese government's reply supposedly indicated the "impossibility" of reaching an agreement on stopping military action in Korea.

The Soviet representative, Tsarapkin, after the representatives of Turkey and Peru, as well as the Kuomintang elements, delivered speeches, made a brief statement, pointing out that the Soviet delegation fully supported the proposal put forward by the government of the People's Republic of China, considering it a proposal for the most rapid peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and all issues related to the People's Republic of China and the Far East. Tsarapkin simultaneously emphasized that the various attempts made by the United States delegation and representatives of other delegations at the meeting could not hide the peaceful nature of the proposal made by the government of the People's Republic of China on January 17th from world public opinion. Tsarapkin concluded by saying: The Soviet delegation believes it is necessary to reiterate that this agenda cannot be discussed in the absence of representatives of the Korean people and the Chinese people.

　　联大政委会十八日会议
    苏代表支持周外长复电
    【新华社二十日讯】塔斯社纽约二十日讯：一月十八日联合国大会政治委员会会议继续讨论美国以“中华人民共和国中央人民政府干涉朝鲜”为名的诽谤中国案。
    前已报道，政治委员会前次会议通过了“朝鲜停火三人委员会的补充报告”中提出的所谓五项原则，并已经由联合国秘书长转达中华人民共和国中央人民政府。
    一月十七日中华人民共和国中央人民政府来电对这些条件作了答复。当政治委员会主席宣读上项复电的全文以后，美国代表奥斯汀即起立发言，他用了一切方法来指责中华人民共和国政府，硬说它不愿采取步骤终止朝鲜的战争。奥斯汀的发言充满了对于中国人民的侮辱与威吓以及对于苏联的狂吠。奥斯汀说，美国政府促请联合国“立即迅速”行动，并坚主通过有利于美国的谴责中国的提案。希腊代表继起发言要求对中国的行动不限于道义的制裁。
    以后，澳大利亚代表发言称，中华人民共和国政府的复文之所以不能被接受，“是有很多理由的”。不过，他却没有把这些“理由”说出任何一条来。澳大利亚代表在结语中促请委员会不要匆忙采取关于讨论中的问题的决定，因为代表们需要时间“互相谘商，并向本国政府请示。”
    法国代表也要求政委会不要采取轻率的措施，他并且说：“联合国各会员国不应该走极端。”
    比利时和菲律宾的代表照例攻击中华人民共和国政府。
    英国代表说：中国政府的答复据说是表明了“不可能”就停止朝鲜军事行动取得协议。
    苏联代表查拉普金，在土耳其和秘鲁的代表以及国民党分子发表演说后，发表了简短的声明，指出苏联代表团完全支持中华人民共和国政府所提出的建议，认为这是一个为了最迅速地和平解决朝鲜问题以及一切有关中华人民共和国和远东的问题的建议。查拉普金同时着重指出：美国代表团和其他代表团的代表在会议中所作的各种企图都不能把中华人民共和国政府一月十七日所提出的建议的和平性质在全世界舆论面前掩盖中华人民共和国。查拉普金在结语中说：苏联代表团认为有必要再度声明，这项议程不可在朝鲜人民和中国人民的代表缺席的情形下讨论。
