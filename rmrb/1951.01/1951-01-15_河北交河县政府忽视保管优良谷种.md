　　Hebei Jiaoxian County Government Neglects Storage of Superior Grain Seeds

To the Editor:

    The Jiaoxian County Government of Hebei Province has neglected the work of storing and promoting superior varieties of grain, resulting in hundreds of thousands of pounds of "Huanong No. 4" millet being mixed with local grain varieties for storage. This has caused significant losses to this year's production increase plan.

    In the past, Jiaoxian did not have superior millet varieties, only local ones, which had low yields and weak resistance to pests and wind. In the spring of 1950, the county promotion center obtained 2,600 pounds of "Huanong No. 4" superior seeds from higher authorities. These were planted as a key promotion effort in seven villages, including Housimen Village near the promotion center and Fengtun Village in the first district, covering about 1,500 mu. The plan was to harvest and then promote them widely. Last year, this millet grew very well. Local millet generally yielded 200 jin per mu (good land yielding 300 jin, poor land yielding 150 jin), while "Huanong No. 4" generally yielded 400 jin per mu (good land yielding 500 to 600 jin, and even the worst land yielded 300 jin). Some farming households planted it as an experiment. The results showed that "Huanong No. 4" generally yielded more than twice as much as local millet. For example, Shang Jinying, a teacher in Fengtun Village in the first district, planted one mu of local millet on a two-mu plot and harvested 150 jin. The one mu planted with "Huanong No. 4" yielded more than 400 jin. As a result, "Huanong No. 4" was very popular among the surrounding villages. The county people's representatives, the county party committee, and the county government all decided to vigorously promote "Huanong No. 4" seeds, striving to popularize them throughout the county within two to three years.

    During the autumn grain collection last year, the county government proposed that the "Huanong No. 4" grain turned in as public grain by the promotion villages and households be collected and stored separately for promotion purposes. However, due to the lack of attention from district-level leading cadres and grain depot cadres, the "Huanong No. 4" grain was mixed with other grains for storage. The promotion center reported the situation to the county, and the county then issued instructions to the district through official documents. After several days of back-and-forth, the depot had already mixed the several tens of thousands of jin of "Huanong No. 4" grain sent separately by the villages with local grain. Similar situations occurred in the first district.

    Last year, a total of 1,500 mu were planted with "Huanong No. 4" seeds in the county. Assuming a minimum yield of 350 jin per mu, the total output could have been more than 500,000 jin. However, only a little over 12,000 jin remain. In the four months since the autumn harvest, only two promoters in the entire county have managed to mobilize the masses to exchange out more than 700 jin. It is truly regrettable that more than 490,000 jin of superior grain seeds have been wasted in this way! If the leadership had paid attention to this work and vigorously promoted it, at least 100,000 mu could have been planted this year. Assuming an increase of 100 jin per mu compared to local millet, it could have increased grain production by 10 million jin. Therefore, the failure to seize the opportunity to promote superior varieties in Jiaoxian this time has resulted in a significant loss.

    The Jiaoxian County Government should seriously review this matter. At the same time, it should find ways to collect and preserve the existing superior grain seeds held by farmers in preparation for use as seeds. Any further delay will result in the farmers using up even the small amount they have left.

### 河北交河县政府忽视保管优良谷种

　　河北交河县政府忽视保管优良谷种编辑同志：
    河北省交河县政府，忽视保管与推广优良品种工作，致使几十万斤华农四号谷与本地谷种混杂一起保存，给今年增产计划造成重大损失。
    过去交河没有优良谷种，都是本地谷种，产量低，抗虫抗风力弱。一九五○年春县推广场从上级领来华农四号谷优种二千六百斤，在推广场附近的后寺门村与一区的封屯等七个村作重点推广种植，约种了一千五百亩，准备收成后大量推广。去年这种谷子长的都很好。本地谷去年一般的每亩收二百斤（好的收三百斤，不好的收百五十斤），华农四号谷一般的每亩收了四百斤（好的收五百斤到六百斤，最不好的每亩也收三百斤）。有些种户是抱试验态度种的。试验结果，一般是华农四号谷比本地谷多收一倍还多。如一区封屯村教员尚金营，他在二亩的一块地里，一亩种的本地谷收了一百五十斤。一亩种的华农四号谷却收了四百余斤，因而华农四号谷在附近各村大受群众欢迎。县各界人民代表会、县委、县府都决定要大力推广华农四号谷种，争取在二、三年内普及全县。
    去年秋征时，县府曾提出要将各推广村、户所交之华农四号谷公粮单收单存，以备推广；但因区级领导干部与粮库干部对此没有重视，将华农四号谷和其他谷子混杂保存了。推广场把情况反映到县，县又利用公文指示到区，这样往返几天，该库已将各村单送的几万斤华农四号谷与本地谷混杂了。一区也有同样情况。
    去年全县共种植华农四号谷种一千五百亩，每亩按最少产三百五十斤计，则总产量可能产五十余万斤，至今只剩下一万二千多斤了。自秋收后至今四个多月的工夫，全县只有两个推广员掌握发动群众互换出去七百多斤。四十九万余斤的优良谷种竟如此的糟踏，实在可惜！如领导上重视这一工作，大力领导推广，至少今年可以推广种植十万亩，每亩按比本地谷多收一百斤计算，可以增产一千万斤谷子。所以，这次交河没有抓紧推广优良品种的工作，损失是很大的。
    交河县政府应认真的检讨这件事。同时应设法把农民现有优良谷种收集保存起来，以准备作种籽用；如再拖延，农民会将现有的一点也用掉了。
