(I) Commemorating the Centenary of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Revolution

Exactly one hundred years ago, the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom uprising, led by Hong Xiuquan, broke out in Jintian Village, Zijing Mountain, Guangxi. This uprising force marched north from Guangxi, fought in Hunan and Hubei, liberated Nanjing, and then carried out the Northern Expedition and the Western Expedition. It persisted for fifteen years, extending its influence to seventeen provinces until it was finally suppressed in July 1864 by the combined forces of reactionary landlord militias and foreign interventionists. During the fifteen years of the revolution, the revolutionary heroes established their own state, organized a powerful armed force, implemented various revolutionary policies, and mobilized the vast peasantry to fight for the overthrow of the feudal land system. Millions of peasants participated in the revolutionary war, and they fought to the very end. When their capital finally fell, hundreds of thousands of soldiers refused to surrender, some even preferring to burn themselves to death. They wrote a glorious page in Chinese history with their heroic actions.

In the history of Chinese feudal society, from Chen Sheng and Wu Guang of the Qin Dynasty more than 2,100 years ago, peasants had waged hundreds of revolutionary wars of varying sizes. The goals of these revolutionary wars were mostly to oppose feudal exploiters and feudal oppressors and to strive for changes in the economic and political status of the peasants themselves. In this regard, the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Movement was the same as the peasant wars before it. However, the scale of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Revolution was unmatched by any previous peasant war. The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom established a relatively complete system in their government and army, confronting the state system and military system of the landlord ruling class for a considerable period, which was also unprecedented. Moreover, the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Revolution took place in the 1850s, when foreign capitalist aggressive forces had already invaded China and had begun to become a dangerous enemy of the Chinese nation. This presented a new task for the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom revolutionaries: what attitude should be taken towards those bandit-like invaders? Should they compromise and yield like the Manchu Qing feudal dynasty, or should they resolutely safeguard the interests and glory of the Chinese nation? The heroes of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom unhesitatingly adopted the latter attitude. That is to say, under the new historical conditions, the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom had already taken on the task of opposing foreign capitalist aggressive forces in addition to the task of opposing feudal forces.

The heroes of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom fought valiantly to accomplish the revolutionary tasks assigned to them by history. Even their enemies had to praise their "perseverance and unyielding spirit." They had driven the Manchu Qing armies into headlong flight, they had beaten the head of the counter-revolutionary landlord militia, Zeng Guofan, to the point of attempting suicide by drowning, and they had repeatedly defeated foreign interventionists armed with modern guns. Their battle achievements were brilliant. But they finally failed.

Historians who study the history of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Revolution have examined the reasons for its failure from various different perspectives. Some said that it was due to the strength of the enemy, especially the intervention of foreign aggressors; some said that it was due to errors in strategic command by the revolutionary forces, who did not take advantage of their victories to strike directly at the Manchu Qing base in Beijing; some said that it was because the leaders of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom were unable to unite all the revolutionary forces that should have been united, and also that in the later period of the revolution, the leaders of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom had internal divisions; some said that it was because after establishing their capital in Nanjing, a trend of pleasure-seeking and corruption grew within the revolutionary ranks, which eroded the revolutionary forces; some said that it was because its leaders, at the critical juncture of the revolution's impending failure in its later stage, did not make the decision to abandon Nanjing and preserve their strength for future development. All of these analyses are correct, and are reasons for the failure of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, and some are also general reasons for the failures of many peasant revolutionary wars in history. But if we further ask, why could the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom not ultimately defeat the foreign interventionists, and why did such and such errors occur? Why couldn't the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom summarize the lessons of the failures of many peasant uprisings in Chinese history and avoid these errors, but instead repeated these errors?

Although the era of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Revolution was already one in which the ancient feudal society had begun to disintegrate and China had begun to enter a semi-colonial and semi-feudal society, in the historical conditions of that time, the modern working class had not yet emerged. Therefore, the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Revolution was still only a purely peasant war without the leadership of the working class, which is the fundamental reason why the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Revolution could not but fail. In feudal society, peasants suffered severe exploitation, demanded liberation, and dared to use armed struggle to strive for liberation. However, peasants are ultimately scattered small producers, and they cannot formulate clear revolutionary programs and use this program to unite all the revolutionary masses; they cannot maintain revolutionary discipline for a long time in order to concentrate their strength to defeat powerful enemies; they lack the ability to use scientific methods to summarize revolutionary experience and use this experience to guide revolutionary practice. Although the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Movement had more significant programs and systems than any previous peasant revolution, such as land system, marriage system, military system, etc., some of these programs and systems were merely unrealizable utopian ideas, and some were gradually destroyed in the course of the revolution's development. The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom's land program ("Tianchao Tianmu System") on the one hand, demonstrated the revolutionary demands of the peasant masses under feudal oppression for land, but on the other hand, the leaders of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom ultimately could only draw an egalitarian pattern from the narrow perspective of the peasant class. According to this pattern, each peasant family should equally possess a certain amount of land and a certain amount of property, so that everyone could only barely live. This pattern was impossible to realize, and this pattern was not for the purpose of developing social productive forces forward, but to make social productive forces stagnate at the level of scattered small-scale farming. Therefore, this utopian agricultural socialist idea was in essence reactionary.

In the previous peasant revolutionary wars in the feudal era before the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, some also failed as tragically as the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, but there were also several that achieved a kind of victory, such as the peasant wars led by Liu Bang and Zhu Yuanzhang, which are famous examples. Although this victory did not liberate the peasant masses (this is because peasants, without the leadership of an advanced class, cannot rely on their own strength to realize any new social system that replaces the feudal system), but could only allow their fruits of victory to be seized by the landlord class, this victory still played an important role in social development and progress. By the time of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, even such a victory was impossible. This is because, in the feudal era, the enemies of the peasant uprising armies were only corrupt feudal lords, and the revolutionary peasants had been able to defeat this enemy militarily through their own strength. When the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom uprising occurred, it was precisely the time when the capitalist powers were invading China, and their combination with feudal forces turned them into more stubborn enemies. Pure peasant wars could not but ultimately suffer defeat when encountering such enemies. Once China had entered the semi-colonial and semi-feudal era, without the leadership of the working class, even a revolutionary movement as grand in scale as the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom could not shake the reactionary forces heavily weighing on the Chinese people in the slightest.

Some researchers of the history of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, seeing that the intervention of foreign aggressors was one of the reasons for the failure of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Revolution, regretted that the leaders of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom "had not handled diplomacy well," had not "won over strong countries," and instead allowed the enemy to obtain "foreign aid." This is a mistaken view. The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom's adherence to the diplomatic principle of equality and autonomy was entirely in line with the interests of the Chinese people and the Chinese nation. Conversely, the Manchu Qing government, in order to entice foreign aggressors to help it carry out internal warfare, did not hesitate to conclude humiliating treaties, committing a serious crime of national betrayal. However, did the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom's foreign policy have no shortcomings? It did. They had mistakenly regarded capitalist aggressors who used Christianity as a signboard as friends because of the similarity in religious form, completely failing to understand that the aggressors were only using missionary work as a tool for aggression, and not anticipating that it was these countries that were full of talk about the doctrines of God that would help the enemy to defeat themselves. Therefore, the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom revolutionaries showed a lack of due vigilance towards foreign aggressors. After the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom captured Nanjing, they did not seize the aggressors' nest, Shanghai, before the capitalist aggressors had gained a firm foothold. This was a concrete manifestation of this lack of vigilance.

Despite the fact that the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom revolutionaries, due to the limitations of historical conditions, could not fully recognize the capitalist aggressive forces they were facing, and despite the fact that the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom revolutionaries had produced some illusions due to religious beliefs, when they saw the aggressors openly drawing their swords against them, they unswervingly adopted the only possible and necessary method that the great Chinese people could take in such a situation. The American hooligan Frederick Townsend Ward first organized the so-called "Ever Victorious Army" to help the Manchu Qing oppose the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. After Ward was killed by the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom's army, he was succeeded by another American, Burgevine. Burgevine did not do well, and was succeeded by the Englishman Gordon. Gordon's so-called "Ever Victorious Army," in coordination with Li Hongzhang's Huai Army, launched a counterattack against the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom's revolutionary army in Jiangsu. The aggressive troops stationed in Shanghai of Britain and France also openly participated in the war against the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. In Zhejiang, there were even French so-called foreign gun teams cooperating with Zuo Zongtang's army to seize the revolutionary positions of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. These foreign bandits encountered strong resistance from the patriotic army of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. The patriotic heroes of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom were not intimidated by the foreign interventionists' foreign guns and cannons, and they demonstrated the heroic spirit of the Chinese people in the struggle against the aggressors. The traitor Li Hongzhang had to admit as a result that "since participating in the war, we have repeatedly suffered setbacks." In Shanghai, according to Li Hongzhang's words, the army of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom had beaten "the foreigners into withdrawing their troops and not moving." The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom general Tan Shaoguang once said after defeating Gordon's attack: "This is only a small wound, and is not enough to relieve my hatred." The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom's expression of the Chinese people's noble patriotism is forever worthy of the Chinese people's pride.

Although the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom failed in 1864, the struggle of the Chinese peasants and people of all oppressed classes to remove the shackles of feudalism and imperialism from their bodies against enemies both internal and external has never ceased for a single day. The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom was the highest peak reached by the old-style peasant war - a peasant war without the leadership of an advanced class. From then on, the peasant revolution could not but break away from this old form and embark on a new path. The Xinhai Revolution led by Sun Yat-sen mobilized the power of the peasants, but the bourgeoisie, due to its own weakness, could not fully unleash the revolutionary potential of the peasant masses. It was not until after the May Fourth Movement that the Chinese people found Marxism, and the working class and its party, the Communist Party, appeared among the Chinese people. History has proven that only the working class armed with Marxist ideology can fully mobilize the revolutionary enthusiasm of the peasant masses. In the nearly thirty years of Chinese revolutionary war, although the peasants were still the main force, this revolutionary war, because it had the leadership of the working class, became a new type of people's revolutionary war that was fundamentally different from any peasant war in history. The Chinese people, under the leadership of the working class, have achieved great victory and created the People's Republic of China, which is unprecedented in Chinese history. This victory is, of course, far beyond what the heroes of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom could have imagined even in their wildest dreams.

### （一）纪念太平天国革命百周年

　　（一）纪念太平天国革命百周年
    整整一百年前，以洪秀全为首的太平天国起义在广西紫荆山前金田村爆发了。这支起义的队伍，由广西北上，转战湖南湖北，解放南京，以后又进行北伐和西征，前后坚持了十五年，势力扩展到十七省，直到一八六四年七月，才被反动的地主武装与外国干涉者的联合力量所扑灭。在革命的十五年中，革命的英雄们建立了自己的国家，组织了强大的武装，实行了各种革命政策，发动了广大农民为推翻封建的土地制度而斗争。上百万的农民参加了革命战争，他们都一直斗争到底，当他们的首都最后陷落时十几万的战士至死不屈，有的甚至宁愿把自己烧死。他们以他们的英雄行动在中国历史上写下了光辉的一页。
    在中国封建社会的历史上，从两千一百余年前的秦朝的陈胜吴广起，农民曾进行过大小数百次的革命战争。这些革命战争的目标大都是反对封建剥削者与封建压迫者，争取农民自身的经济地位与政治地位的改变。在这一点上，太平天国运动与在它以前的农民战争是相同的。但是太平天国革命的规模是过去任何一次农民战争所比不上的，太平天国在他们的政权与军队中建立了比较完整的制度，而与地主统治阶级的国家制度与军队制度在一个相当长时期间相对峙着，这也是空前未有的事情。而且太平天国革命发生在十九世纪五十年代，这时候，外国资本主义侵略势力已经侵入中国，已经开始成为中国民族的危险的敌人。这就在太平天国革命者面前提出了一个新任务：对于那些强盗一样的侵略者，到底采取什么态度呢？是像满清封建王朝一样妥协退让呢，还是坚决地维护中华民族的利益与光荣呢？太平天国的英雄们毫不犹豫地采取了后一种态度。这就是说，在新的历史条件之下，太平天国除了担负起反对封建势力的任务之外，已经担负起反对外国资本主义侵略势力的任务了。
    太平天国的英雄们，为了完成历史所赋予他们的革命任务，曾作了英勇的斗争。即令是他们的敌人，也不得不赞扬他们的“坚忍不屈”。他们曾把满清军队打得狼狈逃窜，他们曾把反革命的地主武装头子曾国藩打得投水寻死，他们也曾屡次击溃用新式枪炮武装着的外国干涉者。他们的战绩是辉煌的。但是他们终于失败了。
    研究太平天国革命的历史学者，曾经从各个不同的方面检讨它失败的原因。有的说，那是由于敌人的强大，特别是由于外国侵略者的干涉；有的说，那是由于革命队伍在战略指挥上犯了错误，他们没有乘胜直捣满清老巢北京城；有的说，那是由于太平天国的领导者没有能够把一切应该团结的革命力量团结起来，而且在革命的后期太平天国领导者的内部又闹了分裂；有的说，那是由于奠都南京后革命队伍内部滋长了享乐腐化的风气，以致腐蚀了革命的力量；有的说，那是由于它的领导者在革命后期快要失败的严重关头没有下定决心抛弃南京，保存实力徐图发展。所有这一些分析都是对的，都是太平天国失败的原因，而且有一些也是在历史上多次农民革命战争遭受失败的一般原因。但是如果我们进一步追问，太平天国为什么不能最终战胜外国干涉者，为什么会发生这种或那种错误呢？太平天国为什么不能总结中国历史上多次的农民起义失败的经验而避免这些错误，却仍旧重复这些错误呢？
    太平天国革命的时代虽然已经是在古老的封建社会开始瓦解，中国已开始进入半殖民地半封建社会的时代，但在当时的历史条件下还没有出现近代的工人阶级，因而太平天国革命仍旧只是一个没有工人阶级领导的单纯农民战争，这就是太平天国革命不能不失败的根本原因。在封建社会中，农民受着严重的剥削，要求解放，而且敢于用武装斗争来争取解放。但是农民究竟是分散的小生产者，他们不可能制定明确的革命纲领，并用这个纲领来团结所有的革命群众；他们不可能长期地维持革命的纪律，以便集中自己的力量战胜强大的敌人；他们缺乏用科学的方法总结革命经验，并用这些经验来指导革命实践的能力。太平天国运动虽然比较过去的一切农民革命有着更显著的纲领制度，如土地制度、婚姻制度、军事制度等等，但这些纲领和制度，有的只是不能实现的空想，有的则在革命的发展过程中逐渐被破坏了。太平天国的土地纲领（“天朝田亩制度”）一方面固然表现了在封建压迫下的农民大众对于土地的革命要求，但另一方面，太平天国的领袖们终究只能从农民阶级的狭隘的眼光出发画出了一个平均主义的图案，按照这种图案，每一农家均应平等地保有一定的土地与一定的财产，使得大家仅仅能够生活下去。这种图案是不可能实现的，而且这种图案并不是为着使社会生产力向前发展，却是使社会生产力停滞在分散的小农经营的水平上的。因此这种空想的农业社会主义的思想在实质上乃是带有反动性的。
    在太平天国以前的封建时代中的历次农民革命战争，有的也像太平天国一样悲惨地失败了，但也曾有几次得到了一种胜利，像刘邦、朱元璋所领导的农民战争，就是著名的例子。这种胜利虽然并没有使农民大众得到解放（这是由于农民在没有先进阶级的领导时单靠自己的力量不能实现任何代替封建制度的新的社会制度），而只能让自己的胜利果实为地主阶级所夺取，但是这种胜利对于社会的发展进步仍然是起了重要作用的。到了太平天国的时代，甚至连这样的一种胜利也是不可能的了。这是因为，在封建时代，农民起义军的敌人不过是腐败的封建领主，革命的农民曾经能够因自己的力量在军事上打败这种敌人。到了太平天国起义的时候，正是资本主义列强侵入中国的时候，他们和封建势力结合在一起，就变成了比较顽强的敌人。单纯的农民战争遇到这样的敌人就不能不在最后遭受失败。在中国既已进入了半殖民地半封建的时代，如果没有工人阶级的领导，甚至像太平天国这样规模宏大的革命运动，也丝毫动摇不了重压在中国人民身上的反动势力。
    有些太平天国历史的研究者看到外国侵略者的干涉是太平天国革命失败的原因之一，就惋惜太平天国领袖们“不曾办好外交”，没有“争取兴国”，反而让敌人取得了“外援”，这是一种错误的看法。太平天国坚持平等自主的外交原则，是完全符合于中国人民和中国民族的利益的，反之，满清政府为着勾引外国侵略者，帮助自己进行内战，不惜订立屈辱的条约，是犯了严重的卖国罪行。然而太平天国的外交政策没有缺点么？有的。他们曾经错误地因为宗教的形式相同的原故，而把以信奉基督教做招牌的资本主义侵略者看做朋友，完全不了解侵略者只是利用传教事业做侵略的工具，没有预想到就是这些满口讲上帝的教义的国家，竟会帮助敌人来打倒自己。因而太平天国革命者曾经表现他们对于外国侵略者缺少应有的警惕。太平天国取得南京以后，没有在资本主义侵略者脚跟尚未站稳的时候，夺取他们的巢穴——上海。就是缺少这种警惕心的一个具体表现。
    尽管太平天国革命者由于历史条件的限制，不能充分认识他所面对着的资本主义侵略势力，尽管太平天国革命者曾经由于宗教信仰而产生了某种错觉，但当他们一看到侵略者公然拔刀相向的时候，他们丝毫也不动摇地采取了伟大的中国人民在这种场合所唯一可能而且必须采取的办法。美国流氓华尔首先组织了帮助满清反对太平天国的所谓“常胜军”。华尔被太平天国的军队击毙后，继之者为另一个美国人白齐文。白齐文干得不好，又继之以英国人戈登。戈登的所谓“常胜军”，与李鸿章的淮军配合起来向江苏的太平天国革命军进行反攻。驻在上海的英国法国的侵略军队也公然参加了对太平天国的战争。在浙江方面，更有法国的所谓洋枪队配合左宗棠的军队夺取太平天国的革命阵地。这些外国强盗受到了太平天国的爱国军队的坚强抵抗。太平天国的爱国英雄们，并没有为外国干涉者的洋枪大炮所吓倒，他们在反对侵略者的斗争中表现了中国人民的英雄气概。汉奸李鸿章曾经不得不因此而承认“参战以来，屡受挫败”。在上海，照李鸿章的话说，太平天国的军队曾经打得“洋人敛兵不动”。太平天国的战将谭绍洸曾经在战胜戈登的进攻之后，说：“此小创耳，犹不足以释我恨也。”太平天国所表现的中国人民的崇高的爱国主义是永远值得中国人民引以自豪的。
    太平天国虽然在一八六四年失败了，但是中国农民和各被压迫阶级的人民为解除身上的封建主义与帝国主义的镣铐而向内外敌人进行的斗争并没有一天停止过。太平天国是旧式的农民战争——没有先进阶级领导下的农民战争所发展到的最高峰。从此以后，农民的革命不能不脱离这种旧的形式，而走上新的道路。孙中山领导的辛亥革命中曾经动员了农民的力量，但是资产阶级由于它自身的软弱性也不能够把农民大众的革命的潜力无限地发挥出来。直到五四运动以后，中国人民找到了马克思主义，中国人民中出现了工人阶级及其政党——共产党。历史证明，只有用马克思主义思想武装了的工人阶级才能够充分地发动农民大众的革命积极性。在近三十年的中国革命战争中，农民虽然仍然是主要的力量，但是这种革命战争因为有了工人阶级的领导，就成为一种和历史上任何农民战争根本不同的新式的人民革命战争。中国的人民在工人阶级的领导下已经得到了伟大的胜利，创造了中国历史上空前未有的中华人民共和国。这个胜利，当然是远非太平天国的英雄们所能够想像于万一的了。
