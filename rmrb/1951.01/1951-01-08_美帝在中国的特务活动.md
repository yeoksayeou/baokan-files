　　American Imperialist Espionage Activities in China
    Chen Lesan
    Between China and the United States, there have traditionally been two utterly different kinds of friendship: one is the friendship between the Chinese and American people, and the other is the "friendship" between Truman and Chiang Kai-shek. The former friendship is manifested in the fact that workers' organizations and people from all walks of life in the United States, despite the strict surveillance of the FBI's secret agents, still sent flowers representing their enthusiasm to our delegation attending the United Nations to discuss the "accusation of American aggression against Taiwan." The latter "friendship," however, is due to an insidious mastermind handing a butcher's knife to a murderer, killing millions of Chinese people; this fact brought two blood-stained hands, shamelessly calling themselves representatives of the friendship between the Chinese and American people, together. Naturally, everyone knows that neither of those bloody hands belongs to the Chinese people, nor to the American people. They are merely the hands of Truman and Chiang Kai-shek, the hands of the American imperialists and the Chinese reactionaries.
    Those two filthy, stinking hands, besides exchanging a world-known enormous amount of bombers, tanks, rocket launchers, carbines, gasoline bombs...all kinds of murderous weapons (which, according to Austin, are the "supply" and "aid" of the United States to the Chinese people), also secretly handed over some relatively small items such as: miniature radios, potent poisons, silent pistols, pen pistols, demolition equipment, fluorescent bombs, etc., which can also be regarded as "supply" and "aid," but were not written in the "White Paper," presumably recorded in the "Chiang's" black ledger of the U.S. State Department. It is unknown whether a "Black Paper" will be published in the future, but this debt is clearly remembered in the blood debt that the U.S. and Chiang owe the Chinese people.
    Without the "assistance" of American special agents, Chiang Kai-shek's spy empire could not have been established. And the American special agents themselves invested heavily in this joint venture, expanding their base in China. When the Chinese people, with the help of the great Soviet Red Army, defeated Japanese imperialism, it supported Chiang Kai-shek in launching the Chinese civil war. Taking advantage of this opportunity, disguised as "mediators" and "repatriators of prisoners," they dispatched all kinds of special agents, secretly engaging in: stealing secrets, murder and arson, spreading rumors and slanders, and disrupting public order, committing all kinds of crimes against the people. However, Truman, Acheson, Austin, Dulles, and others even put white gloves on their blood-stained hands and said shamelessly that they were "friends of the Chinese people." Well, let this "friend" take off his white gloves and take a look at his bloody hands!
    After the outbreak of the Pacific War in 1941, in order to carry out espionage activities in China under the name of "anti-Japanese," the "Intelligence Cooperation Agency" was planned and organized at the suggestion of the "American side." In 1942, Colonel Miles, a standard American rogue and senior special agent, was sent from the U.S. spy headquarters, leading the first group of "experts" to Chongqing; he met with Dai Li, Chiang's chief special agent, and started Chiang Kai-shek's "Gestapo" (Note 1) in Ciqikou, Chongqing, in the concentration camp "Zhazi Cave" that Chiang had specially set up.
    After the signing of the "Sino-American Intelligence Cooperation Agreement" in the spring of 1943, Rear Admiral Miles (Note 2) brought in more than 400 special agent "experts" including Lieutenant Colonel Duke, Major Young, Major Hess, and Major Dewey from the "U.S. Naval Intelligence Office" and the "U.S. Army Strategic Services Office," and officially established the "Sino-American Special Technical Cooperation Organization" with Dai Li, the chief special agent, as the director and Miles as the deputy director.
    In the autumn of the same year, more than a dozen "Sino-American Special Agent Training Classes" - referred to as "Sino-American Training Classes" - were opened in Chongqing, Xi'an, Lanzhou, Ningxia, Shabazhen (please note that the above four places are around the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region), Hua'an, Jian'ou, Jianyang, Shanghai, Nanning, Xuzhou, Hengshan, etc., and tens of thousands of young people were lured to join, after which the American and Chiang special agents instilled them with "common knowledge of special work," "reconnaissance," "murder," "torture," "demolition" and other American-equipped special agent techniques. After being corrupted by the above "American culture," the young people who were absorbed obtained the status of special agent cadres. Then they were uniformly assigned to various "war zones" for several internships in sabotaging the liberated areas, and became "backbones" of anti-communism and anti-people. Relying on these "backbones," they also trained "Mobile Forces" and "Loyal and Righteous National Salvation Army" and other special agent armed forces of about 150,000 people in Hengshan in Hunan, Linru in Henan, Tunxi in Anhui, Shabazhen in Suiyuan, and Jian'ou in Fujian. When the Japanese invaders surrendered, they colluded with the puppet army and raised various banners such as "Sino-American Armed Mobile Team," "Shandong Mobile Detachment," and "North China Pioneer Team," and launched a large-scale invasion of the liberated areas. Before long, in order to cope with the "peace talks" and unified command, they were reorganized into the "Traffic Police General Team."
    In 1944, the "U.S. Strategic Services Bureau" (also known as the "Strategic Intelligence Bureau") established its resident agency in Kunming - the headquarters of the "Strategic Services Office"; and established more than a dozen intelligence teams in the provinces of Jiang's occupied areas of Shaanxi, Sichuan, Xikang, Yunnan, Guizhou, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Guangdong, and Guangxi. In addition, many teams equipped with radio stations were arranged in Chiang's army to collect intelligence with the army. After the Japanese invaders surrendered, this resident agency not only did not end, but moved to Shanghai, and specially transported a large number of radio stations, detection machines and other espionage tools from the United States, and carried out a large number of espionage work throughout China. When the "U.S. Strategic Services Bureau" ended, the personnel, materials and underground organizations inside were transferred to other U.S. special agent agencies in China.
    Before its end - in 1945, Freeman, the director of the "U.S. Ping Strategic Intelligence Office," bought a Chinese named Xiong Xianli, and through him, gradually developed the Beijing team, Lushun-Dalian team, Shenyang team and other intelligence organizations; in exchange for hundreds of pieces of intelligence about the liberated areas, the Soviet Union and North Korea with radio stations, pistols, and U.S. dollars.
    In 1945, Marshall acted as a "mediator," so a large number of intelligence personnel disguised as this "mediator's" "entourage" took the opportunity to carry out activities. The Fourteenth Air Force led by Chennault had famous flight reconnaissance intelligence officers such as Captain Mueller, Lieutenant Hess, and Lieutenant Barnum who conducted detailed aerial reconnaissance work along the Beijing-Hankou, Tianjin-Pukou, Beijing-Shenyang, and Shenyang-Dalian railways.
    In January 1946, a large number of U.S. and Chiang special agents followed Robertson and Zheng Jiemin into the "Military Mediation Executive Department." In May, Colonel Lake, the U.S. representative of the Jinan Executive Truce Group, and Lieutenant Colonel Taylor of the Tai'an Group, took a 5,000-watt radio station, two codebooks, twelve revolvers, three hundred and sixty bullets, an appointment order, and a special agent work order from the Chiang bandit's Second Appeasement Office to the special agent of the puppet bandit army Ning Chunlin stationed in Tai'an City. They took advantage of the convenience of going back and forth to mediation, and brought them from Jinan to Tai'an, helping Wang Yaowu establish a "Special Tai'an Intelligence Team." The special agents of the Tai'an Intelligence Team included Li Guoying, the major leader of the Second Intelligence Group of the Chiang bandit's Second Appeasement Office, Li Peiben, the major leader of the Third Intelligence Group, and Chen Dejun, the captain station chief, and other twelve people, all of whom were from the "Sino-American Training Class"; they were also sneaked into Tai'an in batches by Lake, Taylor, and Zeng Tianquan, the Chiang bandit representative of the Jinan Group - the former deputy director and special agent of the "Second Appeasement Office." Every day, they sent a large number of special agents from the city surrounded by the New Fourth Army to sneak into the liberated areas to gather intelligence. All the materials obtained were handed over to Lieutenant Colonel Taylor and secretly sent to Jinan. These "truce implementation" representatives also sent many intelligence officers to the Jinan and Tai'an executive groups to serve as translators, code clerks, scribes, orderlies, guards, and drivers to carry out secret surveillance, theft, and intelligence liaison work.
    The Chinese civil war expanded day by day under such "mediation."
    After Marshall left, Wei Demai came. He no longer "mediated," and simply found Zheng Jiemin and arranged twenty "espionage zones" around the Shandong Liberated Area, set up several "stations" and "networks," and sent special agents into the Liberated Area to collect intelligence.
    Around this period, another U.S. imperialist espionage agency in China also cooperated with the Chiang bandit reactionary group in carrying out special agent activities in the anti-people civil war. Its external name was the "Army Liaison Group," and its headquarters was located in Shanghai, so its real name was "U.S. Army Department Shanghai Forty-Four Overseas Observation Group." Of course, its scope of activities was not limited to Shanghai. For example, it followed the opportunity of the U.S. imperialist sea and air transport of Chiang's army to the Northeast; it successively set up branch groups in Shenyang, Changchun and other places. In addition to collecting some intelligence from the sent Japanese expatriates and prisoners of war, it also absorbed the majority of Japanese special agents and Mongolian Han traitors to be sent to our Northeast Liberated Area and Inner Mongolia. The people in charge in Shenyang were the American Nazi special agent Senleber and the American Japanese special agent Nishida, and the people in charge in Changchun were the American Japanese special agent Nakamura. The "Shenyang U.S. spy case" that was cracked by the public security organs of the Northeast People's Government in 1949, which caused a sensation, belonged to the espionage organization led by the above-mentioned Shenyang spy agency and the former "U.S. Consulate in Shenyang."
    The "Military Action Far East Department" was a specialized anti-Soviet and anti-Communist "action" special agent organization organized in 1948 by the U.S. diplomatic representative to China, John Caldwell, and Major Riggs. The steps for them to carry out their work were to start from China, establish branches in Hong Kong, Shanghai, Nanjing, Beijing, Tianjin, etc., look for White Russians, Koreans and Chinese, and gradually organize them to sneak into the Northeast, North Korea, Outer Mongolia and Western Turkestan, and then expand outward.
    The "Military and Political Espionage Office," jointly formed by the "U.S. Army Department's Military Advisory Group in China" and other military and political special agent agencies after the Japanese surrender, was also a special anti-Soviet and anti-Communist special agent organization. It recruited various international special agents and assigned them to the "China Department" and the "Soviet Department" to carry out espionage work.
    Following the U.S. ambassadors to China (that is, Hurley, Stuart and other "gentlemen") who came to China to "promote friendly relations," there was an organization called the "U.S. Embassy Diplomatic Espionage Office." This organization was composed of intelligence, management, "third country" (Soviet Union), and "China" groups. Because it colluded with the "International Intelligence Office of the Second Department of the Ministry of National Defense," it was also called the "Joint Intelligence Office." Wherever there were American expatriates in China, there were activities of their "embassies and consulates." Therefore, even in the border areas where ethnic minorities of China such as Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, and Tibet live, there were traces of this intelligence agency.
    In August 1949, the Xinjiang People's Public Security Bureau cracked an international spy case in Aershan that involved spying on military intelligence, murdering people, spreading rumors and sabotage, and attempting to steal military and political documents and a certain important ore produced in local mines. The criminals were four stateless White Russians (one was killed for resisting arrest, and one escaped), and the instigator was Mark Nan, the former U.S. Vice Consul in Dihua.
    The "U.S. Information Service," which belongs to the same category as the "Voice of America," in addition to often throwing some sugar-coated poisons to some intellectuals who are obsessed with "American culture" and publicizing imperialist culture, also has the task of collecting intelligence in its mission. Of course, when conditions are ripe, it does not give up the opportunity to cooperate with other institutions to send a special agent or two to the liberated areas; the case of the U.S. special agent Li Jiaqi cracked in the East China Liberated Area in August 1948 was an example of the Jinan "U.S. Information Service" cooperating with the KMT special agent to dispatch the agent.
    After the People's Liberation Army successfully crossed the Yangtze River in 1949, the U.S. imperialists once strengthened the "cultural liaison" work of the "U.S. Information Service" in various places. In addition to stepping up the collection of public intelligence, it also used "concerts," "tea parties," and "film receptions" to win over some upper-level intellectuals and students, planning to deceive a group of college students and professors to study in the United States, but this "friendly" intention was not realized under the vigilance of our government and people.
    In 1947, the Public Security Bureau of the Northeast People's Government found "U.S. aid materials" such as U.S.-made radio transceivers, detonators, pistols, bullets, and military knives in the Catholic Church in Qiqihar; as well as leaflets of "thoroughly anti-Communist," communiqués defaming the People's Government, and receipts for providing funds and weapons to KMT special bandits. In the face of the evidence, the priests and nuns confessed to the crime of colluding with the KMT bandits and contacting the U.S. representative of the Changchun Group of the Military Mediation Executive Department by radio to privately communicate intelligence. Thus, it was proved that the Changchun Catholic Convent was also a liaison station designated by the U.S. special agent agency. In 1948, the Public Security Bureau of the Jizhong People's Government cracked the "Xianxian Catholic Church Spy Case," and also found a radio station in the church, as well as a telegram signed by Sun Lianzhong of the "Commander-in-Chief of the Eleventh War Zone" of the KMT bandits, which read, "I have learned that the troops have been sent to enter the area to suppress the bandits." Shang Jianxun, the main culprit and the chairman of the Catholic Jesuit Association, also confessed to the situation of contacting the Tianjin U.S. special agent Maud and the U.S. military chaplain for intelligence.
    In April 1948, two "distributors" of the "American China Relief Group," a "secretary" of the "U.S. Consulate in Ping," and a "reporter" of the United Press drove a jeep from Baotou through Gongmiao to the Etuok Banner area in southern Suiyuan, which was full of yellow sand and sparsely populated, to "investigate and relieve the poor people." Of course, the people in that area were not rich, but they became the object of "relief" out of thin air because this area happened to be adjacent to the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Liberated Area. In May, the "Relief Group" and Daxi Nima, the secretary-general of the Xisunit Banner of the KMT, and other Mongolian special agents transported four cars of property to Xisunit Banner, Sairwusu Banner and other places on the border between China and Mongolia, and transported more than 200 bandits in the area to Ula Mountain in western Suiyuan for "rectification."
    In August 1949, Truman, seeing that the war on the mainland was coming to an end and the play of the "Embassy" was not easy to continue, the "U.S. Ambassador" Stuart was recalled to Washington by his State Department. The U.S. special agents who were originally in mainland China were scattered and deployed around the new China and cooperated with the KMT special agents to form a special agent encirclement against the new China. At the same time, the U.S. Consul General in Hong Kong was ordered to "take advantage of the opportunity for China to absorb construction technical personnel" to send spies into various economic departments as much as possible. And the extremely bored Youth Party bandit Zeng Qi and Li Huang could not be satisfied with the KMT bandit's subsidies, so they defected to MacArthur in the face of the "third force," and in the name of raising funds for the activities of the "third force," they cooperated with Japanese special agents to massively counterfeit RMB, planning to transport them into our country through Hong Kong and Macao to disrupt and sabotage our country's finance. Ren Yuandao, the great traitor of the Wang puppet regime's "Commander-in-Chief of the Pacification Army," who had not been erased from the Chinese people's memory, Yang Zhonghua, the Han traitor who was training special agents for invading China in Yokosuka, Japan for "General MacArthur," and Zhang Fakui, the Cantonese bandit who was colluding with the U.S. special agent Sun Baogang in Hong Kong to jointly direct the "underground activities in Guangdong and Guangxi," were also given the titles of "Commander of the South China Branch of the Pacific Strategic Guidance Department," "Commander-in-Chief of East China," and "Commander-in-Chief of South China" by MacArthur as the "third force," and ordered them to command the few bandits remaining on the mainland to engage in killing, arson, and disrupting public order. In order to cooperate with the movement to excavate "democratic individualists," the special agent Bishop Yu Bin also hurriedly received a huge amount of funds from the U.S. "Central Intelligence Agency" and sent capable leaders to Hong Kong to find suitable "candidates," who would be sent to the United States for "advanced training" at any time, and then sent back to mainland China to establish "underground organizations."
    In January 1950, the U.S. "Central Intelligence Agency" was afraid that the disciples were not good enough, so it sent a special agent master named Donovan, who was the head of the special team "J" responsible for directing sabotage and terror (the director of the U.S. Strategic Services Bureau during World War II), to Hong Kong to convene more than 20 important U.S. special agents stationed around the southwestern border of China to discuss the policy of special agent activities against China, and instructed how to lead the KMT special agents to carry out "anti-Communist guerrillas" on the Chinese mainland.
    The U.S. special agents summarized ten years of work experience in China and believed that the greatest achievement was still the "Sino-American Cooperation Organization." In November 1949, the "Central Intelligence Agency" summoned Zheng Jiemin from Taiwan to Washington to plan the reconstruction of the "Sino-American Cooperation Organization." In February 1950, Zheng Jiemin and the old special agent Miles partnered up and went to Hong Kong. According to the organizational regulations of the former "Sino-American Cooperation Organization," they recruited the special agent personnel of the original "Sino-American Cooperation Organization," "Strategic Services Office," "U.S. Consulate," and "U.S. Information Service" on the existing basis of the "Hong Kong Sino-American Intelligence Office" to form a Sino-American intelligence cooperation organization of "borrowing a corpse to return the soul." After Donovan returned to the United States, a large number of U.S. special agent intelligence personnel were sent to Hong Kong; and the U.S. government allocated 7 million from the 75 million U.S. dollars of "aid to China" as funding. Some rogue special agents who had already graduated from the training class began to sneak into liberated China with their "tools" and with secret orders to collect intelligence, assassinate staff, instigate "people's" riots, and sabotage land and water transportation.
    During this period, the U.S. special agents had established a strong telecommunications detection work on Okinawa; Japan, South Korea, Guam, Taiwan, and the Philippines had also become strongholds for "General MacArthur" to train special agents; in addition to the special agents sent to mainland China, they also sent more than 100 U.S. and Japanese special agents to Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand, Burma, India, Tibet and other places around liberated China to establish work. In early February 1950, the U.S. Chiefs of Staff "Tokyo Conference" suggested that the U.S. government strengthen the two major espionage strongholds of Japan and the Philippines. The U.S. imperialist Far East "diplomatic personnel's" "Bangkok Conference" in February supplemented the above "suggestions." According to a Reuters report at the end of February: Three new strongholds are being opened, and more than 400 espionage personnel will be sent by the U.S. government to the Far East. And those personnel who had worked in the U.S. consulate in China, because they were "familiar with the road," were being rearranged to the "strategic strongholds" around China's "iron curtain." A spy web surrounding China, from Korea to India, with Tokyo as the center and Taiwan as the base of operations, was gradually woven.
    From the northernmost end of this poisonous web, the U.S. imperialists launched the war of aggression against Korea. MacArthur, one of the managers of the U.S. special agents in the Far East,妄想 (vainly attempted) to send a group of special agent war criminals picked out of the Tokyo Sugamo Prison, who were considered "China problem experts," and a group of Han traitors from the Wang puppet period and the remnants of the Chiang bandits that had been accumulated over the years; into the "gap" in the northeast corner of China on his map of aggression against Korea. However, under the powerful blows of the Chinese People's Volunteers in cooperation with the Korean People's Army, his intention was obviously foiled again. However, the U.S. imperialists will not give up, and in the future, their renewed special agent tricks will emerge in an endless stream. Therefore, the Chinese people must be more vigilant and continue to smash all special agent sabotage activities of the U.S. imperialists.
    Note 1: The secret police organization under the rule of the Nazi Party in Hitler's Germany.
    Note 2: Miles was promoted three times in a row to the rank of Major General in 1944 for his "meritorious service" in training Chiang's special agents, strengthening "Sino-American cooperation," and massacring the Chinese people.

　　美帝在中国的特务活动
    陈乐叁
    在中国和美国之间，传统上有着两种绝然不同的友谊；一种是中美人民之间的友谊，另外一种是杜鲁门和蒋介石之间的“友谊”。前面的一种友谊表现在：美国各地的工人组织、各界人民不顾联邦调查局的特务们监视之严，仍然把代表着他们热情的鲜花送给我国出席联合国讨论“控诉美国侵略台湾案”代表团的事实上。而另外一种“友谊”却是由于一个阴险的主谋犯把屠刀递给了凶手，杀害了千万中国人民，这件事实才把两只毫不知羞耻地也自称为中美人民友谊的血手握到一起。自然，谁都知道那两只血手之中，没有任何一只是中国人民的手，也没有美国人民的手。那只是杜鲁门和蒋介石的手，美帝国主义者和中国反动派的手。
    那两只龌龊腥臭的手，除却交接过举世皆知的巨量的轰炸机、坦克车、火箭炮、卡宾枪、汽油弹……种种杀人武器（若照奥斯汀的说法那就是：美国对中国人民的“供应”和“援助”）外，还暗地授受过若干：袖珍电台、烈性毒药、无声手枪、钢笔手枪、爆破器材、萤光炸弹之类比较细小的物品，也算是“供应”和“援助”罢，不过“白皮书”里没有写上去，想是登记在美国国务院的“蒋记”黑账里面了。将来是否还要出一部黑皮书不得而知，但是这笔债在美蒋积欠中国人民的血账里是记得明明白白的。
    没有美特的“援助”，蒋介石的特务家业是建立不起来的。而美特自己也就在这一合股生意中大大地投资，扩展了它们在中国的基础。当中国人民在伟大的苏联红军帮助下，战胜了日本帝国主义者的时候，它就支持蒋介石发动了中国的内战。利用这一时机伪装“调处”、“遣俘”，撒出各种各样的特务，悄悄地干着：窃取机密、杀人放火、造谣污蔑、扰乱治安种种残害人民的罪行。虽然，杜鲁门、艾奇逊、奥斯汀、杜勒斯等竟将洁白的手套套在他们血污的手上，厚颜无耻地说出他们是“中国人民的朋友”。好，就让这位“朋友”剥下他的白手套来，看一看它的血手吧！
    一九四一年太平洋战争爆发后，为了用“反日”的名义开展中国境内的谍报活动，就在“美方”提议下筹划举办“情报合作机构”。一九四二年从美国特务大本营派来一个标准美国流氓、高级特务梅乐斯中校，率领着第一批“专家”到了重庆；会合了蒋记大特务头子戴笠，就在重庆磁器口，业经蒋特辟就的集中营“渣滓洞”，经营起蒋介石的“格杀打扑”（Gestapo）（注一）来。
    一九四三年春“中美情报合作协定”签订后，由梅乐斯海军准将（注二）引来包括“美海军谍报处”及“美陆军战略服务处”的杜克中校、杨格少校、赫斯少校、杜威少校等特务“专家”四百余人，正式成立了以大特务头子戴笠为主任，梅乐斯为副主任的“中美特种技术合作所”。
    同年秋天，在重庆、西安、兰州、宁夏、陕坝（请注意以上四处在陕甘宁边区周围）、华安、建瓯、建阳、上海、南宁、徐州、衡山等地开办了十几处“中美特工干部训练班”——简称“中美训练班”，先后诱骗了几万青年，经美蒋特务灌输“特工常识”、“侦察”、“谋杀”、“刑讯”、“爆破”等美械化特务技术。被他们吸收的青年经过以上几项“美国文化”腐蚀之后，就取得特务干部的身份。再统一分配给各“战区”作几次破坏解放区的实习，便成为反共、反人民的“基干”，依靠这些“基干”，又在湖南衡山、河南临汝、安徽屯溪、绥远陕坝、福建建瓯等地训练了：“别动军”、“忠义救国军”等特务武装约十五万人。到日寇投降时，便勾结了伪军，纷纷竖起：“中美武装别动队”、“山东别动支队”、“华北先遣队”等杂色旗号，大举向解放区进犯。未几，为应付“和谈”及统一指挥起见，合编成“交警总队”。
    一九四四年“美国战略服务局”（又叫“战略情报局”），在昆明成立了它的驻华机关——“战略服务处”总部；并在陕西、四川、西康、云南、贵州、河南、湖北、湖南、广东、广西诸蒋占区省份，建立了十几处情报小组。另将许多配有电台的小组安排在蒋军部队中，随军搜集情报。日寇投降后这个驻华机关不仅没结束，反而迁往上海，又特地从美国运来大批电台，侦测机器等谍报工具，大量开展起全中国的谍报工作来。及至“美国战略服务局”结束，这里边的人员、物资和地下组织才移转给其它在华美特机关。
    当它未结束之前——一九四五年“美国驻平战略情报处”处长佛利曼曾收买了一个中国人叫熊先立，经过他，逐渐发展了北平组、旅大组、沈阳组等情报组织；用电台、手枪、美钞交换了成百件有关解放区、苏联和北朝鲜的情报。
    一九四五年马歇尔作了“调人”，于是扮作这个“调人”“随从”的大量谍报人员，趁机大肆活动。陈纳德领导的第十四航空队里就有着著名的飞行侦察情报员穆勒上尉、赫斯中尉、巴特奈姆少尉等在京汉、津浦、北宁（京沈）及沈大各铁路沿线，作过详细的空中侦测工作。
    一九四六年一月大批美蒋特务随着饶伯森、郑介民钻进“军事调处执行部”，五月军调济南执行停战小组美代表雷克上校和泰安小组泰勒中校，把蒋匪第二绥署二处发给驻在泰安城里的汉奸宁春霖伪匪部特务的五千瓦电台一部、密码两本、左轮手枪十二支、子弹三百六十发、派令一件、特务工作命令一件利用来往调处之便，从济南带进泰安；帮助王耀武成立了“特别驻泰情报组”。驻泰情报组的特务有蒋匪二绥署谍二组少校组长李国楹、谍三组少校组长李培本，上尉台长陈德俊等十二名，都是“中美训练班”出身；也都是经过雷克、泰勒、和济南小组蒋匪代表——原“二绥署二处”副处长特务曾天泉的左遮右盖，分批潜入泰安的。他们每天从被新四军包围的城里派出大批特务溜到解放区刺探情报。凡得到材料，一律交给泰勒中校密送济南。这几位“执行停战”的代表，另外又派了许多情报员，到济南、泰安两执行小组里担任翻译、译电、缮写、勤务、侍卫、司机等职以进行秘密的监视、偷窃和情报联络工作。
    中国的内战就在这样的“调处”下一天一天扩大起来。
    马歇尔走后，来了一个魏德迈，他不再“调处”了，干干脆脆找着郑介民在山东解放区周围布置了二十个“谍报区”，分设了若干“站”、“网”，送特务进解放区搜集情报。
    也是这个时期前后，另外一个美帝驻华间谍机关也配合了蒋匪反动集团，进行反人民内战中的特务活动，它的对外名称是“陆军联络团”，它的总部设在上海，因此而真名便叫做“美国陆军部上海四十四海外观察组”。当然它的活动范围是并不限于上海的。例如它就曾跟着美帝海空运蒋军的机会到了东北；先后在沈阳、长春等地设了分团。除却在遣送的日本侨民、俘虏中放手搜集了一些情报外，更吸收了多数日特及蒙汉奸特派入我东北解放区和内蒙。在沈阳主持其事的是美籍纳粹特务森勒伯和美籍日特西田，在长春主持其事的是美籍日特中村。一九四九年为我东北人民政府公安机关破获而哄动一时的“沈阳美间谍案”，就是属于上述沈阳间谍机关及前“美国驻沈领事馆”领导的谍报组织。
    “军事行动远东部”是一九四八年由美驻华外交代表约翰柯德韦尔及里格斯少校奉命组织的专门反苏反共的“行动”特务组织。它们开展工作的步骤是先从中国做起，在香港、沪、宁、平、津等地建立支部，物色白俄、朝鲜人和中国人，逐渐组织他们潜入东北、北朝鲜、外蒙古及西土尔其斯坦等地再扩展出去。
    日本投降后由“美陆军部驻华军事顾问团”等军政特务机构联合组成的“军事政治谍报处”，也是一个专门反苏反共的特务组织。其中网罗了各种国际的特务分隶在“中国部”和“苏联部”下面进行谍报工作。
    随着美国驻华大使（就是赫尔利、司徒雷登这些“绅士”们）来到中国“促进邦交”的，有一个叫做“美大使馆外交谍报处”的机构，这个机构是由情报、经理、“第三国”（苏联）、“中国”几个组组成的。因为和“国防部第二厅国际情报处”狼狈为奸，所以也叫“联合情报处”。中国境内有美国侨民的地方，就有他们的“使、领馆”的活动。所以连远至内蒙、新疆、西藏等中国少数民族聚居的边疆地方，也都有着这个情报机构的踪迹。
    一九四九年八月间，新疆人民公安机关在阿山破获了一件刺探军情、杀害人命、造谣破坏、企图盗取军政文件及当地矿山所产某种重要矿石的国际间谍案。犯人是四名（还因拒捕打死一个，跑掉一个）无国籍的白俄，而主使人却是前美驻迪化副领事马克南。
    和“美国之音”属于同一范畴的“美国新闻处”除却经常向某些醉心“美国文化”的知识分子投掷一些糖衣的毒药，宣传宣传帝国主义文化外，在它的任务里还有搜集情报一项。当然有成熟条件时也不放弃配合其它机构派遣个把特务到解放区来的机会；一九四八年八月，华东解放区破获的美特李家祺案就是由济南“美国新闻处”协同军统特务进行派遣的一例。
    一九四九年人民解放大军胜利渡过长江后，美帝曾一度加强各地“美国新闻处”的“文化联络”工作，除加紧搜集公开情报外，更利用“音乐会”、“茶话会”、“电影招待会”拉拢一些上层知识分子和学生，计划骗一批大学生和教授去美国“留学”，但是，这一“友好”的意图在我政府和人民警惕下没有实现。
    一九四七年东北人民政府公安机关，在齐齐哈尔的天主堂里搜出美制无线电收发报机、雷管、手枪、子弹、军刀等项“美援物资”；和“彻底反共”的传单、诽谤人民政府的通令、还有供给蒋特匪徒经费、武器的收据。在人赃俱获的情况下，神父、会母们供出：勾结蒋匪，与军调执行部长春小组美代表巴劳电台联系，私通情报的罪状。因而证明，长春天主教修女院也是美特务机关指定的联络站。一九四八年冀中人民政府公安机关破获了“献县天主堂间谍案”也是从教堂内搜出电台来，另外还有蒋匪“第十一战区司令长官部”孙连仲签署的“呈悉，已派部队进驻迳剿矣”的代电。主犯天主教耶稣会会长副主教法人尚建勋并供出和天津美特毛德及美随军神父联系情报情形。
    一九四八年四月“美国中华救济团”的两名“分配员”，“美国驻平领事馆”的一名“书记”，和合众社的一名“记者”，驾着吉普车由包头经公庙到绥远南部，遍地黄沙、人烟稀少的鄂托克旗一带去“调查救济贫民”。当然那个地区的人民是并不富裕的，不过凭空成为“救济”对象却是因为这个地区恰巧邻近陕甘宁解放区。五月，“救济团”偕蒋党西苏尼特旗书记长达西尼玛等蒙特，载运了四辆汽车的资财到中蒙交界之西苏尼特旗、赛尔乌苏旗等地方，把该地二百多名土匪运到绥西乌拉山“整训”去了。
    一九四九年八月，杜鲁门眼看大陆上的战事行将结束，“大使馆”的戏往下不好唱了，驻南京“美大使”司徒雷登被他的国务院召回华盛顿。原在中国内地的美特们便分散布置在新中国的四周与蒋特合作，组成一个对新中国的特务包围圈。同时，美驻港总领事馆也受命“利用中国吸收建设技术人材的机会”尽量派遣间谍打入各经济部门活动。而穷极无聊的青年党匪棍曾琦、李璜不能满足于蒋匪的津贴，就以“第三种势力”的面目投靠了麦贼，借筹措“第三种势力”的活动经费为名，与日特合作大量赝造人民币，计划经港澳运入我国，以扰乱、破坏我国金融。在中国人记忆里还没勾掉的汪伪“绥靖军总司令”大汉奸任援道，在日本横须贺给“麦总”训练侵华特务的汉奸杨仲华，和正在香港勾结美特孙宝刚共同导演“两广地下活动”的粤匪张发奎也都以“第三种势力”的资格，被麦贼加以“太平洋战略指导部华南分部司令”、“华东总司令”、“华南总司令”等头衔，叫他们指挥少数残留大陆的土匪从事杀人、放火、扰乱治安的勾当。为了配合发掘“民主的个人主义者”运动，特务主教于斌也慌忙向美“中央谍报局”领取了巨额经费，派了得力头目去港物色适当“人选”，随时资送美国施以“高级训练”，然后再行遣回中国大陆，建立“地下组织”。
    一九五○年一月，美“中央谍报局”恐怕徒弟们不济事，派了一个特务师父叫杜诺万是专门负责指导破坏、恐怖的特别小组“Ｊ”组的头子（二次世界大战时，美战略服务局的局长。）赶到香港，召集派在围绕中国西南边疆的重要美特二十余人，开会讨论侵华特务方针，并指示了如何领导蒋特开展中国大陆上的“反共游击队”。
    美特总结了十年在华工作经验，认为最大的成绩还是“中美合作所”一段。一九四九年十一月“中央谍报局”把郑介民从台湾召到华府，策划重建“中美合作所”事宜，一九五○年二月，郑介民、梅乐斯老特务搭挡到了香港，按照前“中美合作所”组织条例，在“香港中美情报处”的已有基础上，搜罗了原“中美合作所”、“战略服务处”、“美国领事馆”、“美国新闻处”的特务人员，组成了“借尸还魂”的中美情报合作机构。杜诺万返美后，大批的美特情报人员派到了香港；并且由美政府从“援华”的七千五百万美元中拨出七百万充作经费。一些在训练班已然毕业的流氓特务，开始带着他们的“工具”，领了搜集情报、暗杀工作人员、策动“民众”暴动、破坏水陆交通的密令，偷偷地溜入解放的中国。
    这期间，美特在冲绳岛已建立起强力的电讯侦测工作；日本、南朝鲜、关岛、台湾、菲律宾也都已成为“麦总”训练特务的据点；除了派到中国大陆上来的特务以外，他们还把百余名美特、日特先后送往马来亚、越南、泰国、缅甸、印度、西藏等解放了的中国外围去建立工作。一九五○年二月初，美参谋长“东京会议”建议美政府加强日、菲两大谍报据点。美帝远东“外交人员”二月的“曼谷会议”，对上述“建议”又有所补充。据美联社二月底透露：三个新的据点正在开设之中，将有四百余名谍报人员被美政府派往远东。而那些前在中国美领馆工作过的人员，因为是“轻车熟路”，正被重新安排到沿中国“铁幕”四周的“战略据点”上去。一条从朝鲜到印度，以东京为中枢，台湾为策动基地的、包围中国的间谍毒网渐渐织成了。
    从这面毒网的最北端，美帝发动了侵朝战争。作为远东美特经理人之一的麦克阿瑟，妄想把他从东京巢鸭监狱里拣出一伙被认为是“中国问题专家”的特务战犯，和几年来积攒下的一批汪伪时期的汉奸和蒋匪的残兵败将；在他的侵朝地图上的中国东北角的“缺口”间一股脑输送进来。不过在中国人民志愿军配合朝鲜人民军的有力打击下，他这一意图显然又落空了。但是，美帝是不会死心的，今后它的翻新的特务花样将更会层出不穷。因此，中国人民必须更加警惕，继续击破美帝一切特务破坏活动。
    注一：希特勒德国纳粹党统治下的秘密警察组织。
    注二：梅乐斯因训练蒋特、加强“中美合作”、屠杀中国人民有“功”连升三级，至一九四四竟晋至少将。
