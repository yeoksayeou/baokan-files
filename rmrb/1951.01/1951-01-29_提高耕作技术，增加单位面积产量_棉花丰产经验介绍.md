Increase unit area yield by improving farming technology.

Introduction to Cotton High-Yield Experiences

Editor's Note: Improving farming techniques and increasing yield per unit area is one of the main keys to current agricultural production. The ongoing North China Agricultural Technology Conference aims to summarize and exchange experiences in increasing cotton and grain production, serving as a reference for completing agricultural production and improving technologies in 1951 to achieve the goal of increased production. We will now selectively introduce cotton planting experiences as follows (the calculation standard for yield per mu varies from place to place, with some using seed cotton and others using lint cotton. According to the general conversion rate, three jin of seed cotton can be ginned into one jin of lint).

I. Zhou Shun from Linqing, Hebei, produces 470 jin of seed cotton per mu
　　Zhou Shun planted four mu of dry land cotton last year, with an average yield of 470 jin per mu (frost-front cotton accounting for 92.5%), truly a new record for dry land cotton planting.
　　Zhou Shun lives in Liujiafen Village, Zone 1, Linqing County, Hebei Province, and is a cotton planting expert in his sixties. His main cotton planting techniques include the following:
　　(1) Select Fine Varieties and Sow at the Right Time. He planted the Si Zi 2B improved variety. He selected seeds from individual plants in the field the previous year and carefully selected the seeds again before sowing, removing small and inferior seeds and selecting only healthy and full seeds of the same type for planting. The sowing period was after the Grain Rain solar term. According to his experience, early sowing makes the ground cold and difficult to sprout, while late sowing easily leads to rampant growth, late maturity, and reduced harvest.
　　(2) Intensive Cultivation and Application of Base Fertilizer. His cotton field was winter-plowed once, but not harrowed after plowing. In the spring, it was spring-plowed once, with base fertilizer applied at a rate of one large cart of manure and 130 jin of soybean cake per mu, and harrowed three times. After sowing, weeding and hoeing were carried out eight times. Earthing up can be done at the same time as hoeing.
　　(3) Plant Large Ridges and Leave Sparse Seedlings. He used a single-legged cultivator to plant cotton in wide ridges, leaving about 2,000 seedlings per mu.
　　(4) Timely Pest Control. In April, aphids appeared in the cotton field. As soon as they were discovered, he used pesticides to control them, continuously for four times, until they were completely eradicated.
　　(5) Carefully Prune and Remove Suckers. As soon as the cotton had mosquito-mouth-sized buds, he began pruning, stripping the lower leaves, removing water suckers, picking the top tips, and removing fruit branch tips, for a total of seven times, implementing flexibly according to the growth of the cotton plants. Each plant had an average of fifteen to twenty bolls, with the upper and lower bolls generally the same size, maturing early and uniformly, and most of the cotton fluffed before frost.
　　His techniques of paying attention to aphid control and pruning were the most effective. Liu Zijin's cotton in the same village, with the same soil quality and fertilizer, did not pay attention to aphid control and did not implement pruning, yielding only 60 to 70 jin of cotton per mu; Sun Yuke also eliminated aphids but did not prune, the cotton bolls grew unevenly, yielding only 150 jin of cotton per mu, and red cotton accounted for more than 40% of the total yield.
　　Zhou Shun is the secretary of the CCP branch. Not only does he grow cotton well himself, but he also actively leads the entire village to grow more cotton, expand mutual aid organizations, often exchange production experiences with everyone, and encourage everyone to improve technology and increase yields. Last year, he created a new record of 470 jin, and more than 40 of the 53 cotton-growing households in the village also achieved yields of more than 200 jin per mu.

II. Handan Farm produces 600 jin of seed cotton per mu
　　In order to improve cotton production and serve as a demonstration for farmers, Handan Farm, through improved technology and the active cultivation of workers, achieved a yield of 2,007 jin of seed cotton from three mu and three fen of breeding land (irrigated land), averaging 608 jin per mu. The five mu yielded a total of 2,827 jin of seed cotton, averaging 565 jin per mu (frost-front cotton accounting for 95%), creating a new record for high yield per unit area. Handan Farm's high-yield experiences are as follows:
　　(1) Select Fine Varieties and Ensure Seedling Survival. The farm planted Si Zi 2B cotton. Seed selection was carried out before sowing, and all degenerated and substandard seeds were removed to ensure that all cotton seeds were full, with uniform grain shape and color. The seeds were soaked in boiling water to reduce germs and promote germination, so there were very few missing seedlings last year.
　　(2) Deep Plowing and Multiple Fertilizations. Plowing was done once in the autumn and once in the spring, each time reaching a depth of five inches. Fine harrowing was done after plowing to preserve moisture. The average base fertilizer applied per mu was 1,000 jin of horse manure, 50 jin of peanut cake, 20 jin of superphosphate, and 20 jin of wood ash, which were scattered on the ground during spring plowing and then plowed in. Topdressing averaged 180 jin of rapeseed cake per mu. The method was to dig pits four or five inches away from the cotton plants and apply fertilizer, mix it with the soil, and bury it flat before flowering when the seedlings were one foot tall. Last year, due to the application of superphosphate and wood ash, the fruit branches and cotton bolls developed very well, with an average of more than 38 bolls per plant.
　　(3) Sowing Period and Row and Plant Spacing. Spot sowing was done in mid-April, with a row and plant spacing of two chi.
　　(4) Timely Irrigation and Intensive Cultivation. Weeding was done twice last year, and hoeing was done five times, ensuring that there were no weeds left in the cotton field. Irrigation was done twice. The first watering was done when the first fruit branch had a flower bud, and the second watering was done after more than 20 days to ensure that the cotton field was not short of water (it rained very timely last year and there was no shortage of water). Due to the large amount of fertilizer applied, the cotton plants developed very vigorously, and topping and pruning became necessary work. When the plants were one chi and two or three cun tall, all overgrown branches were cut off, and axillary buds were removed as they grew. However, care should be taken not to damage the epidermis of the cotton plants. When the plants were two chi tall and had twelve or thirteen fruit branches, topping was carried out. Timely pruning and removing of suckers negated the idea that cotton fields cannot be heavily fertilized.
　　(5) Pest and disease control is an important part. Aphids were treated six times, red spiders three times, and leaf rollers were treated as they appeared.

III. Full-Area High Yield in the Suburbs of Shijiazhuang
　　In the early days of liberation (1948), cotton fields in the suburbs of Shijiazhuang City accounted for only 7% of the cultivated area, but by last year it had expanded to 27.8%. Although it suffered from aphid and hailstorm damage, cotton still achieved unprecedented high yields. The highest yield per mu reached 480 jin of seed cotton. In Liuying Village, 1,300 mu of cotton were planted, with about 900 mu yielding more than 300 jin of seed cotton per mu, about 400 mu yielding more than 200 jin, and only one household yielding 150 jin. The average yield of the entire village was 293 jin per mu, and the average yield of the entire district was 213 jin. The reasons for the district's increased production are:
　　(1) Deep Plowing and Multiple Harrowing were Universally Implemented. According to surveys, the depth of plowing is generally four to six cun. On average, land was plowed two and a half times and harrowed five and a half times, and hoed five times. On average, 3,812.5 jin of straw manure and 106 jin of refined fertilizer were applied per mu.
　　(2) Seed Selection and Soaking Seeds in Boiling Water. In the spring of last year, the improved seed ginning factory in the cotton improvement guidance area loaned out 96,116.5 jin of Si Zi cotton seeds, most of which were loaned out after being selected by the factory. Some of the seeds that had not been selected were selected by the government leading the farmers, along with those selected in the field by the masses the previous year. According to statistics from various districts, seed cotton selected by the farmers accounted for more than 80%. The masses have a habit of soaking seeds when planting cotton, but the main purpose is to promote germination, so they mostly use cold water. Last year, more than 80% of households used boiling water to soak the seeds, reducing the loss from diseases.
　　(3) Timely Sowing. Sowing was completed about one cun deep, five days after the Grain Rain.
　　(4) Weeding and Hoeing. Some farmers adopted the three-time seedling thinning method. After the seedlings emerged, they were thinned once when they had three to four leaves, again when they were about three cun tall, and seedlings were fixed when they were five cun tall. Through these three procedures, the phenomenon of missing seedlings in cotton fields was greatly reduced by the two-time seedling thinning method generally used by farmers. Many people also used transplanting methods to replenish seedlings. Hoeing began during the second thinning and continued until the cotton branches covered the entire row spacing. Generally, hoeing was done five times, and up to seven or eight times in some cases.
　　(5) Pruning and Removing Suckers were Universally Implemented. The district has good irrigation conditions and a lot of fertilizer is applied, so pruning and removing suckers must be carried out. In the past, the masses mostly planted medium cotton, and only Liuying Village and its surrounding areas planted foreign cotton, so most farmers had no experience in pruning. The year before last, when pruning and removing suckers was promoted, some people pruned, and a few did not. As a result, the yield of those who pruned was higher, while the yield of those who did not was very low due to the proliferation of branches. Having learned this practical lesson, the masses universally carried out the removal of vegetative branches, top tips, and fruit branch tips last year, generally leaving about ten fruit branches, and some leaving eleven or twelve. As a result, most cotton bolls were more than 20, generally averaging sixteen or seventeen. However, due to insufficient fertility, there were no bolls on the top branches, and fertility must be increased this year. More meticulous farmers used scissors to prune. The masses reflected: "Whoever puts in more effort will harvest more cotton; whoever puts in less effort will harvest less cotton."
　　(6) Vigorous Leadership in Helping Farmers Eliminate Cotton Aphids. As soon as cotton sowing was completed, the masses were mobilized to weed and prevent aphids, and women and children participated in this work. Primary school students alone removed more than 145,400 jin of weeds. In the 6th District, 90% of the households in Danggiazhuang went to the fields to weed, and Ma Shuangyin's mother in Dianshe Village pulled more than 500 jin of weeds in six days, creating a surge of weeding. After the cotton seedlings emerged, aphids appeared on the two cotyledons. The government immediately led the masses to use large hoes to pull, bury with hot soil, and scatter wood ash, kang base soil and other methods to control them. All cotton fields were pulled with large hoes once, and some were pulled two or three times before the aphids were gradually eliminated. When the cotton seedlings grew to five or six cun tall, aphids became serious again, spreading to more than 30% of the cotton field area (severely affected) before the rainy season, withering leaves that lacked vitality. Under the call of the government, cadres, production experts, and others led the masses to actively mobilize and use cotton oil emulsion, tobacco lime water, rotenone powder and other agents to control them. Generally, they were treated twice, and some were treated up to seven times. The cotton seedlings in the 2,800 mu of the 5th District and the 9,700 mu of the 6th District, which were severely affected by cotton aphids, were transformed into strong and lush cotton plants.

　　提高耕作技术，增加单位面积产量
    棉花丰产经验介绍
    编者按：提高耕作技术，增加单位面积产量，是当前农业生产的主要关键之一。正在进行着的华北农业技术会议，就是要很好地总结和交流棉粮增产的经验，作为完成一九五一年农业生产提高技术的借鉴，以达到增产的目的。现在先将植棉经验择要分别介绍如后（文中每亩产量计算标准，根据各地习惯，有的用籽棉，有的用皮棉，按一般折合率，是三斤籽棉可轧得一斤皮棉）。
  一、河北临清周顺每亩产籽棉四百七十斤
    周顺去年种了四亩旱地棉花，每亩平均产量达到了四百七十斤（霜前花占百分之九二·五），实在是旱地种棉的新纪录。
    周顺家住河北省临清县一区柳家坟村，是一个六十多岁的植棉生产能手。他的种棉技术，主要的有下面一些特点：
    （一）精选良种，适时播种。他种的是斯字二Ｂ良种，头年经过田间棵选留种，播种前又仔细粒选一遍，把小籽劣籽剔出去，尽挑健全饱满同类型的棉籽作种。播种期在谷雨节后。根据他的经验，播早了地寒不易出苗，迟了容易长疯棵，成熟晚，收成减低。
    （二）精耕细作，多施基肥。他的棉田冬耕一遍，耕后不耙，开春后春耕一遍，翻底粪，每亩下粪肥一大车、豆饼一三○斤，耙三遍。下种以后，间苗中耕除草共达八遍。中耕时并可同时培土。
    （三）种大垅、留稀苗。用独腿耧耩花，宽垅，每亩留苗约二千来棵。
    （四）及时治虫。四月间棉田生了蚜虫，刚一发现，他便用药水治，连续治了四次，除个干净才止。
    （五）精细地整枝打杈。棉花一有蚊子嘴时，他便开始整修，捋裤腿、去水杈、摘顶尖、去果枝梢，共整了七遍，随时依据棉棵生育情形灵活实施。每棵平均有十五到二十个桃，上下的桃子一般大，成熟早而整齐，霜降前大部开絮完毕。
    他的注意治蚜和整枝打杈技术成效最显著，同村柳子金的棉花，同样土质肥料，没注意治蚜也没实行整枝打杈，每亩只收花六、七十斤；还有孙玉科灭了蚜，但没整枝，棉桃生长早晚不一，每亩只收花一百五十斤，而且红花占全产量四成以上。
    周顺是中共支部书记，不但自己种棉好，而且还积极领导全村多种棉花，扩大互助组织，经常和大伙交流生产经验，带动大家改进技术提高产量。去年他自己创造了四百七十斤的新纪录，全村种棉户五十三户，有四十多户每亩产量也都达到了二百斤以上。
  二、邯郸农场每亩产籽棉六百斤
    邯郸农场，为了提高棉花产量，给农民作示范，经过提高技术与工人的积极耕作，在五亩繁殖地中（水地），有三亩三分产籽棉二、○○七斤，平均每亩六○八斤，五亩共产籽棉二、八二七斤，平均每亩五六五斤（霜前花达百分之九十五），创造了单位面积丰产的新纪录。邯郸农场的丰产经验如下：
    （一）精选良种，切实保苗。该场种的是斯字二Ｂ棉，播种前进行了粒选，将退化籽及不合标准的籽，一律拣掉，使棉籽全部饱满，粒形、颜色整齐一律，并用开水浸种，以减少病菌，促进发芽，因而去年缺苗很少。
    （二）深耕与多施肥。秋耕、春耕各一次，每次均达五寸深，耕后细耙，保存水分，每亩平均施基肥马粪一千斤，花生饼五○斤，过磷酸钙二十斤，草木灰二十斤，于春耕时撒布地面，再耕。追肥每亩平均菜籽饼一八○斤，施的方法，在开花前苗高一尺时，离棉棵四、五寸远的地方，挖坑施入肥料，与土壤混合埋平。去年由于施了过磷酸钙与草木灰，使果枝及棉铃发育很好，每株平均三十八个铃以上。
    （三）播种期及行株距。四月中点播下种，行株距均二尺。
    （四）适时灌溉与精耕细作。去年共间苗二次，中耕五次，保证了棉田不留杂草；灌溉两次，当第一果枝有一个花蕾时，进行第一次浇水，隔二十余日浇第二次，使棉田不缺水分（去年下雨很适时，不缺水）。由于施肥多，棉棵发育很茂盛，摘心整枝成为必然的工作，在株高一尺二、三寸时，剪去所有徒长枝，腋芽随生随去。但应注意不伤及棉棵表皮。当株高二尺，果枝十二、三个时，进行打顶，由于适时的整枝打杈，否定了很多人认为棉田不能多施肥的说法。
    （五）防治病虫害是重要的一环。共治蚜虫六次，治红蜘蛛三次，卷叶虫随生随治。
  三、石家庄市郊区全区丰产
    石家庄市郊区，在解放初期（一九四八年），棉田仅占耕地面积百分之七，到去年扩大到百分之二七·八。虽然经过了蚜虫与冰雹的为害，棉花仍获得了空前的丰产。每亩产量，最高的达籽棉四百八十斤。留营村植棉一千三百亩，每亩产籽棉三百斤以上者，达九百亩左右，二百斤以上者四百亩左右，一百五十斤者仅只一家。全村平均产量每亩二百九十三斤，全区平均是二百一十三斤。该区能获得增产的原因是：
    （一）普遍实行了深耕多耙。据调查，耕地深度一般是四寸至六寸。平均耕地二次半，耙地五次半，中耕五次。施肥每亩施草圈粪平均达三、八一二·五斤，细肥一百零六斤。
    （二）粒选棉种，开水浸种。去年春季由棉花改进指导区的良种轧花厂贷放斯字棉种九六、一一六·五斤，大部经该厂粒选后出贷，其中一部未经粒选的与群众在前年田间选出的由政府领导农民进行了粒选。据各区统计，粒选棉籽达百分之八十以上。群众种棉向有浸种习惯，但主要目的是为催芽，因而多用凉水，去年百分之八十以上的户多用开水侵种，减少了病害的损失。
    （三）播种适时。深一寸左右，谷雨后五天即播种完毕。
    （四）间苗与中耕。一部分农民采取了三次定苗法。苗出土后，三至四个叶时疏拔一次，至三寸左右再疏拔一次，五寸高时定苗。经此三次手续，一般农民两次定苗使棉田缺株现象大大减少。也有不少群众，又用移植方法进行了补苗，第二次疏拔时即开始中耕，直至棉枝罩满整个行间时才行停止。一般的中耕五次，有多至七、八次的。
    （五）普遍进行了整枝打杈。该区灌溉条件好，施肥多，必须进行整枝打杈。以前群众都种中棉，只有留营村及其周围种洋棉，因此大部农民对整枝没有经验。在前年提倡整枝打杈，一部分群众整了枝，少数群众没整枝，结果整枝的产量多，不整枝的枝杈丛生，产量很少。群众有了这个实际教训，去年普遍进行了去孽枝，去顶尖，去果枝尖，一般的留十来个结果枝，有留十一、二个结果枝的。因而棉桃大多在二十个以上，一般平均有十六、七个。但由于肥力不够，顶枝无桃，今年还须增加肥力。比较细致的农民，用剪刀整枝，群众反映：“谁下工夫大，谁的棉花收的多；谁下工夫小，棉花收的少。”
    （六）大力领导农民消灭了棉蚜。在棉花播种刚刚结束，即发动群众进行除草防蚜，妇女儿童都参加了这一工作。仅小学生即除草一四五、四○○余斤。六区党家庄百分之九十的户下地除草，大安舍村马双印的母亲六天拔草五百多斤，造成除草热潮。棉苗出土后，二个子叶时，就生了蚜虫，政府遂即领导群众用大锄拉，热土埋，撒草木灰、炕坯土等办法除治，所有棉田用大锄拉了一遍，有的拉了二至三遍，棉蚜才被逐渐消灭。到棉苗长到五、六寸高时，蚜虫又严重了，在雨季前蔓延到棉田面积的百分之三十（严重的）以上，苗萎叶曲，没有一点生气。在政府号召下，干部、生产能手等带动群众积极动员起来，用棉油乳剂、烟草石灰水、鱼藤粉等药剂除治，一般的均治了二次，有的治到七次，五区二、八○○亩、六区九、七○○亩受棉蚜为害严重的棉苗，即转变为肥壮茂盛的棉棵。
