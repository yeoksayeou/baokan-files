Xinhua News Agency, New York, January 28th: The Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly continued its debate on the Korean issue on January 27th.

The Indonesian representative, Palar, strenuously advocated further efforts to seek coordination in accordance with the principles of the twelve-nation proposal—Indonesia being one of the co-sponsors of the proposal. In rebutting the arguments of Philippine representative Romulo, Palar pointed out that in resolving the Indonesian issue, the United Nations chose the path of negotiation instead of condemnation. He also emphasized that the experience of the Indonesian issue proved that a ceasefire was not necessarily a prerequisite.

The next speaker was the Bolivian representative, who supported the US proposal.

The Polish representative, Katz-Suchy, said that Poland believes that the People's Republic of China's response to the Political Committee is a complete program for resolving the Korean and other Far Eastern issues in accordance with international law and the United Nations Charter. If the majority of countries in the Political Committee truly want to achieve stable peace in the Far East, the Political Committee should not reject any of the suggestions from the People's Republic of China. However, it is very clear from many statements—including Acheson's hasty and abrupt rejection of Beijing's suggestions—that the United States does not want to seek a solution. Katz-Suchy continued: Poland supports the Asian and Arab countries' proposal with some reservations, because Poland believes that all possibilities for a peaceful solution should be fully utilized. Poland believes that although the twelve-nation proposal is not thorough on fundamental issues, the proposed exploratory conference as a preliminary step is helpful for the peaceful resolution of the Far Eastern issue. Katz-Suchy then said: Poland supports the two amendments proposed by the Soviet Union on January 26th.

Katz-Suchy then said: Poland strongly opposes the US proposal because it is a "dangerous proposal" that attempts to expand the war. He pointed out that the United States is already using unprecedented methods of applying pressure. The US President, the Senate, and other government agencies are all trying to win support for their proposal aimed at expanding the war. Katz-Suchy pointed out that the further war aims of the US military authorities in the Far East were revealed on January 25th by Washington columnist Allen. He said that the ultimate goal of the US military preparations in the Far East is to invade China. Katz-Suchy emphasized that by any standard of recognized international law, the United States is an aggressor. He pointed out that the United States occupied Taiwan long before the Chinese People's Volunteers appeared in Korea, which is an aggression against China.

The South African representative, Jooste, supported the US proposal.

The Abyssinian representative also supported the US proposal, but also raised the kind of reservations put forward by the Canadian and British representatives.

The Lebanese representative, Malik, insisted that there was no incompatibility between the Arab-Asian proposal and the US proposal, and therefore Lebanon would vote in favor of both proposals.

The US representative, Austin, then spoke, saying that the United States opposed the twelve-nation proposal. He demanded that the Political Committee accept the US proposal. At this point, the Political Committee adjourned and was scheduled to reconvene on January 29th.

　　联大政委会廿七日会议
    波代表支持我建议
    【新华社二十八日讯】塔斯社纽约二十八日讯：联合国大会政治委员会一月二十七日继续辩论朝鲜问题。
    印尼代表巴拉竭力主张依照十二国提案——印尼为该案的联合提案国之一——的方针作进一步的努力以求得协调。巴拉在驳覆菲律宾代表罗慕洛的论点时指出：在解决印尼问题时，联合国选择了谈判的道路而不采取谴责的办法。他并且着重指出：印尼问题的经验证明：并不是非先停火不可的。
    下一个发言的是波利维亚代表，他支持美国的提案。
    波兰代表卡茨·苏琪说：波兰认为，中华人民共和国对政治委员会的答复是依照国际法和联合国宪章解决朝鲜和其他远东问题的一个完备的纲领。如果政委会中大多数国家真正想求得远东和平的稳定，政委会就不应该拒绝中华人民共和国的任何建议。但是，从许多声明——艾奇逊急急忙忙仓猝拒绝北京建议的声明亦在其内——可以看得很清楚：美国并不想求得解决。卡茨·苏琪继续说：波兰在有某种保留的条件下支持亚洲和阿拉伯国家的提案，因为波兰相信，应该充分利用和平解决的一切可能性。波兰认为十二国提案虽然在基本问题上不透澈，但其中所建议的以探讨会议作为一个初步的步骤来说，对于远东问题之和平解决是有帮助的。卡茨·苏琪接着说：波兰支持苏联在一月二十六日提出的两个修正案。
    卡茨·苏琪接着说：波兰强烈反对美国提案，因为这是一个竭力要扩大战争的“危险的提案”。他指出：美国已经在使用空前未有的横施压力的办法。美国的总统、参议院和其他的政府机关都在竭力拉拢，希望他们以扩大战争为目的的提案得到支持。卡茨·苏琪指出：美国军事当局在远东的进一步的战争目的已于一月二十五日为华盛顿专栏作家艾伦透露出来了。他说：美国在远东的军事准备的终极目标是入侵中国。卡茨·苏琪强调指出：从公认的国际法的任何一个标准来看，美国都是侵略者。他指出：在中国人民志愿部队还没有在朝鲜出现以前，美国早就占领了台湾，这就是侵略中国。
    南非代表乔士德支持美国提案。
    阿比西尼亚代表也支持美国提案，但也提出了加拿大与英国代表所提出的那种保留。
    黎巴嫩代表麦里克硬说阿拉伯——亚洲提案与美国提案之间并无不能并容的地方，因此，黎巴嫩对这两个提案都将投票赞成。
    美国代表奥斯汀继之发言，他说，美国反对十二国提案。他要求政委会接受美国的提案。至此，政治委员会休会，订于一月二十九日再开。
