　　Letter from Faculty, Staff and Students of Three Departments of Peking University Medical College

　　Respected Chairman Mao:
　　We, the professors, lecturers, teaching assistants, technicians, workers, and fourth-year medical students of the Pharmacology Department, Parasitology Department, and Pathology Department of Peking University Medical College, have made significant progress in political and ideological education and in our academic studies over the past year. In the past year, some of our teachers and students went to Ulanqab League and Ikzhao League in Suiyuan to provide medical care for our Mongolian compatriots. Before we set off, leaders of the Ministry of Health instructed us: you are going there with Chairman Mao's concern for the minority nationalities. Therefore, when we worked on the Inner Mongolian grasslands, this sentence constantly encouraged us to overcome difficulties. When we were about to return, Mongolian compatriots everywhere held us back, saying, "We know why you can come to the grasslands to treat us. It is because we have Chairman Mao. In the future, we must step up production to repay Chairman Mao." On the way back, a Mongolian woman rode a horse from more than seventy li away to carefully hand us a piece of milk skin (a kind of food), repeatedly urging us to bring it to you. This simple emotion made us deeply feel that serving the people under the banner of Mao Zedong is the greatest glory. Some time ago, more of our teachers and students went to factories to carry out propaganda work for resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea to protect our homes and defend the country. The elderly Professor Lin Zhengang also went to explain current events, and the workers' grievance meetings deeply educated us. We and the workers were like brothers, and once again we personally experienced that the road of intellectuals combining with workers and peasants, as instructed by you, is correct. In addition to carrying out propaganda, we also enthusiastically responded to the call of the motherland to rapidly strengthen national defense construction, and many students actively participated in military cadre schools.
　　Chairman Mao: All of this is inseparable from your wise and correct leadership. How can we express our deep love and support for our great leader today? We jointly and resolutely express: we are already preparing to respond to the call of the motherland at any time. Wherever we are needed, we will go; whatever we are asked to do, we will do. In school, we will do everything possible to further master science and technology, strengthen the study of current affairs and politics, and prepare strength for the motherland!
　　Respectfully wishing you
　　Eternal health!

　　Pharmacology Department and Fourth-Year Medical Students and Staff

　　北京大学医学院三个科师生员工的信敬爱的毛主席：
    我们北京大学医学院药理学科、寄生物学科、病理学科的教授、讲师、助教、技术员、工友和医学系四年级的同学们，一年来，在政治思想教育上、在业务课的学习上都有了显著的进步。去年一年中，我们有的师生到绥远乌兰察布盟、伊克昭盟去为蒙胞看过病。出发前，卫生部首长指示我们：你们是带着毛主席对少数民族的关怀前去的。因此，我们到了内蒙草原工作时，这句话随时都在鼓舞着我们克服困难。我们要回来时，到处蒙胞都拉住我们不放，他们说：“我们知道为什么你们能到草地上来给我们治病？这是因为有了毛主席，今后我们一定要加紧生产来报答毛主席。”在回来的路上，一个蒙古妇女骑着马从七十多里以外赶来，把一张奶皮子（一种食品）谨慎地交给我们，再三叮嘱一定要把它带给您。这种淳朴的感情使我们深深感到：在毛泽东旗帜下，为人民服务是最大的光荣。前些日子我们有更多的先生和同学到工厂去进行抗美援朝保家卫国的宣传工作，年老的林振纲教授也去讲解时事，工人们的诉苦运动深深教育了我们。我们和工人们在一起像是亲兄弟一样，又一次亲身体会到您指示我们的，知识分子和工农兵相结合的道路是正确的。除了进行宣传并且还热烈地响应了祖国迅速加强国防建设的号召，不少同学踊跃参加了军事干部学校。
    毛主席：这一些都是与您的英明、正确的领导分不开的。在今天，我们怎样表示对我们伟大的领袖深切的爱戴和拥护呢？我们共同坚决表示：我们已经在准备着随时响应祖国的号召，需要我们到什么地方，就到什么地方；需要我们做什么就做什么。在学校里，我们尽一切力量进一步掌握科学技术，加强时事政治学习，为祖国准备力量！
          敬祝您
    永远健康！
                          北京大学医学院
