　　Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 20th—The People's Liberation Army's Central South Military Region and Fourth Field Army's cultural work is gradually implementing the principle of "serving the soldiers, prioritizing popularization," vigorously carrying out cultural activities in the companies.

　　Various corps' performance troupes and propaganda teams have overcome difficulties such as the dispersal of troops and inconvenient transportation, and have gone deep into the companies to carry out work. The Central South Military Region and the Fourth Field Army's Political Department, Logistics Department, Health Department, and the Central South Military and Political University's performance troupes frequently went deep into the companies and the Logistics Department's factories and hospitals to perform; the military region's thirty-three film projection teams also regularly toured the troops to show movies. A propaganda team of a certain unit marched on foot for more than eight hundred li to tour and perform in various companies. Troops engaged in suppressing bandits in Hunan, Hubei, and Guangxi used singing to mobilize the masses and publicize policies. Troops engaged in production tasks also used singing to inspire labor enthusiasm. Various corps' performance troupes and propaganda team members also performed, collected materials, and created at the various sites of dike construction, road repair, logging, and mining. They also helped soldiers write scripts, direct, and act. Now many companies have organized soldiers' theater groups.

　　The content of the dramas performed by the corps' performance troupes, propaganda teams, or company soldiers is based on the current situation and the specific tasks of the troops. For example, in the suppression of bandits, helping rural areas carry out land reform, and in the movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend the country, dramas and other literary and artistic works that publicize these movements were promptly compiled and performed, which proved to be very effective.

　　In order to encourage creation, the military region and the Field Army Political Department promulgated the "August 1st Literary and Artistic Creation Bonus Regulations" last year on "August 1st Army Day." Some units have established creation groups or creation review committees. The military region and the Field Army Political Department have also published the monthly magazine "Literary and Artistic Warriors" to promote and guide the literary and artistic movement in the troops. Soldiers' literary and artistic creation has now been greatly developed. Twenty-eight soldiers of a certain unit wrote 602 kuaiban (clapper talk) pieces in twenty-five days, and eight companies of a certain unit created seven short plays in a month and a half. These creations all depict real people and real events, and have great educational significance after the performances.

　　In terms of training literary and artistic work cadres, in addition to the various performance troupes and propaganda teams cultivating activists in the companies to become the backbone of the company's literary and artistic activities, various departments have also established specialized training institutions. The Central South Military Region and the Field Army's Central South Troops Art School have trained a large number of reserve forces for the troops' literary and artistic workers. The first graduates of the school, more than 300 people, have been distributed to various troops to work.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 20th—The literary and artistic work of the People's Liberation Army's Southwest Military Region troops, which focuses on cooperating with the troops' advance, bandit suppression, policy publicity, and current affairs study, has achieved good results in the past year. There are now more than 14,000 literary and artistic workers in various units under the entire military region; all corps' performance troupes (teams) have performed nearly 11,000 times in the past year, with an audience of more than 15,640,000 people; more than 640 kinds of scripts, songs, and dances created by soldiers and literary and artistic workers have been performed; in addition, 25 kinds of literary and artistic works have been published.

　　At present, the literary and artistic work of the Southwest Military Region troops has become an important part of the troops' political work. In the movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend the country, the literary and artistic workers of various departments have compiled historical materials of American imperialism's aggression against China and the atrocities of the U.S. military into picture story books, kuaiban (clapper talk), and living newspaper dramas, which are rotated and exhibited or performed in the troops to help the troops carry out ideological education work. Prior to this, when the troops marched towards the Southwest region and Tibet, the corps' performance troupes (teams) first overcame the harsh climate and set up mobilization sheds, tea stalls, and mutual aid groups for physical strength everywhere on the roads of high mountains and grasslands, allowing the soldiers to forget fatigue and persevere in the atmosphere of singing, laughter, mutual assistance, and friendship. Many literary and artistic workers went deep into the companies, marched and fought alongside the soldiers, and used their spare time to perform plays for the soldiers, teach songs, and help the soldiers establish a cultural and recreational life. In the case of dispersed troops, they often held small evening parties for one or two platoons.

　　Troops' literary and artistic work is also a powerful assistant in carrying out mass work in the newly liberated areas. They have used forms such as dramas, dances, wall newspapers, slogans, cartoons, and speeches to quickly publicize the various policies and disciplines of the People's Government and the People's Liberation Army in factories and schools in the newly liberated cities; and organized and united local literary and artistic figures to assist them in reforming old operas and ballads. After entering minority areas, the performance troupe of a certain unit of the Yunnan Military Region performed dramas such as "Military-Civilian Relations" among the local residents, which was warmly welcomed by the people of all ethnic groups, and quickly returned some minority people who had been deceived by the propaganda of the Kuomintang bandit army and fled into the deep mountains.

　　In addition, the troops' literary and artistic workers also helped the soldiers with their creations. In three months, the literary and artistic workers of a certain unit, together with the soldiers, created more than 150 kinds of scripts.

　　中南及西南军区各部队
    开展文艺活动加强思想教育
    【新华社汉口二十日电】人民解放军中南军区暨第四野战军的文艺工作，逐步贯彻“为兵服务，普及第一”的方针，大力开展连队文艺活动。
    各部文工团、宣传队曾克服了部队分散、交通不便等困难，深入各个连队进行工作。中南军区及四野政治部、后勤部、卫生部和中南军政大学的文工团，经常深入连队及后勤部所属各工厂、医院出演；军区的三十三个电影放映组，也常巡回部队放映电影。某部宣传队员曾徒步行军八百余里，至各连巡回演出。在湖南、湖北和广西各地剿匪的部队，曾用演唱发动群众、宣传政策。担任生产任务的部队，也通过演唱鼓舞劳动热情。各部文工团、宣传队员并在筑堤、修路、伐木和采矿的各现场进行演出，搜集材料和创作。他们并帮助战士进行编剧、导演和演戏。现许多连队都组织了战士剧社。
    各部文工团、宣传队或连队战士演出的戏剧内容，都是根据当时形势和部队的具体任务编写的。例如在剿匪作战、帮助农村进行土地改革、以及在抗美援朝保家卫国运动中，都及时地编演出宣传这些运动的戏剧和其他文艺作品，收效很大。
    为了鼓励创作，军区和野战军政治部曾于去年“八一建军节”颁发“八一文艺创作奖金条例”。若干单位已建立创作组，或创作审评委员会。军区和野战军政治部还出版了《文艺战士》月刊，来推动、指导部队文艺运动。战士的文艺创作现已得到很大发展。某部二十八名战士在二十五天中写了六百零二篇快板，某部八连一个半月中创作了七个短剧本。这些创作都是写真人真事，演出后教育意义很大。
    在培养文艺工作干部方面，除各文工团、宣传队在连队中培养积极分子，使之成为连队文艺活动的骨干外，各部并设立了专门的训练机构。中南军区和野战军所设立的中南部队艺术学校，培养了大批部队文艺工作人员的后备军，该校首届毕业生三百余人已先后分发至各部队工作。
    【新华社重庆二十日电】以配合部队进军、剿匪、宣传政策和时事学习为主要内容的人民解放军西南军区各部队的文艺工作，一年来获得良好成绩。全军区所属各部现共有文艺工作者一万四千余人；全军各文工团（队）在一年中演出近一万一千次，观众达一千五百六十四万余人；战士和文艺工作者创作的剧本、歌曲、舞蹈，已经演出的有六百四十余种；此外，并出版了二十五种文艺作品。
    目前西南军区各部队的文艺工作，已成为部队政治工作的重要组成部分。在抗美援朝保家卫国运动中，各部文艺工作者均将美帝国主义侵华史料和美军暴行绘编成连环图画、快板和活报剧，在部队中轮回展览或演出，帮助部队进行思想教育工作。在此以前，当部队向西南地区及西藏进军时，各部文工团（队）首先战胜了恶劣的气候，在高山和草原的道路上，到处设置鼓动棚、茶水站和体力互助组，使战士们在歌唱欢笑、互助友爱的气氛中，忘记疲劳，坚持前进。许多文艺工作者都深入连队，和战士们一道行军作战，利用空隙时间为战士们演戏，教歌，帮助战士们建立文化娱乐生活。在部队分散的情况下，他们常为一、两个班举行小型晚会。
    部队文艺工作又是开展新解放区群众工作的有力助手。他们曾利用戏剧、舞蹈、壁报、标语、漫画、讲演等形式，把人民政府和人民解放军的各种政策和纪律，迅速地向新解放城市的工厂、学校中宣传；并组织和团结当地文艺界人士，协助他们进行旧曲艺的改革工作。云南军区某部文工团，在进入少数民族地区后，曾在当地居民中演出《军民关系》等戏剧，受到各民族同胞的热烈欢迎，使部分误受国民党匪军欺骗宣传逃入深山的少数民族人民很快返回。
    此外，部队的文艺工作者还帮助战士进行创作。某部的文艺工作者，在三个月内，曾和战士们一起创作了一百五十多种剧本。
