　　Xinhua News Agency, New York (TASS dispatch): Broad sections of the American people are responding to the historic resolutions of the Second World Peace Congress.

　　The Alameda Town (California) organization of the American Progressive Party held a meeting in Berkeley. American representatives who attended the World Peace Congress reported to the audience on the various resolutions of the Congress. The meeting unanimously passed a telegram calling for the prohibition of atomic weapons and a peaceful resolution of the Korean conflict.

　　People with various political beliefs and religious faiths have written to Truman and members of Congress, urging them to guarantee world peace. The *Daily Worker* published a letter from ministers of the Baptist Church in Spring Valley (New York) to Truman. In this letter, the ministers called for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea, the admission of the People's Republic of China to the United Nations, the prohibition of atomic bombs, and a peaceful resolution of the Korean conflict.

　　A letter from Mrs. Hyman of Grantsburg (Wisconsin) to Truman was also published in the *Daily Worker*. In the letter, she wrote that she had spoken with many farmers and townspeople, and she had not found a single one of them who approved of American intervention in Korea. She concluded her letter by writing: "We, the farmers and townspeople, want peace, and we want peace now."

　　The *Local Leader* newspaper in Frederic (Wisconsin) published a letter from Mrs. Miller of Milltown, emphasizing that the Korean conflict was provoked by capitalists to seize Korea's resources. Mrs. Miller called for an end to the precious bloodshed of American and Asian youth.

　　美国广大阶层人民响应世界和大决议
    【新华社七日讯】塔斯社纽约讯：美国广大阶层的人民响应第二届世界保卫和平大会的历史性的决议。
    美国进步党阿拉美达镇（加利福尼亚州）党组织在柏克利地方开会。美国出席世界和大的代表们向会众报告世界和大的各项决议。会议一致通过一项通电，呼吁禁止原子武器、和平解决朝鲜冲突。
    抱着种种不同的政治信念和宗教信仰的人民，纷纷致函杜鲁门和国会议员们，敦促保障全世界的和平。《工人日报》发表斯普林谷（纽约州）浸礼教会教士们致杜鲁门的一封信。教士们在这封信中呼吁一切外国军队退出朝鲜、接纳中华人民共和国加入联合国、禁止原子弹、和平解决朝鲜冲突。
    格朗兹堡（威斯康星州）的海曼夫人致杜鲁门的一封信也发表于《工人日报》。她在信中写道：她曾与许多农民及镇上居民们谈话，她不曾发现他们中间有一个人赞成美国干涉朝鲜。她在信的结语中写道：“我们，农民们和镇上居民们都要和平，我们现在就要和平。”
    腓特烈（威斯康星州）的《地方领袖报》发表密尔镇的米勒夫人的一封信，内中强调指出：朝鲜冲突是资本家们为了攫取朝鲜的资源而挑拨起来的。米勒夫人呼吁不要再使美国青年和亚洲青年流着宝贵的血了。
