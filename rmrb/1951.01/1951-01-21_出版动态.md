　　Publishing News
    In order to implement the policy of specialized division of labor decided by the First National Publishing Conference, the People's Publishing House was established in December last year under the leadership of the General Administration of Publications. The professional direction of the company is to publish political and current affairs readings and social science readings. The main tasks of the company in 1951 are: to strengthen the publication of political books, social science books, and various auxiliary reading materials to help cadres study, and to improve the quality, political nature, and seriousness of publications.
    The People's Education Publishing House, jointly led by the Ministry of Education and the General Administration of Publications, was also established at the same time as the People's Publishing House. The professional direction of the People's Education Publishing House is to publish textbooks and general educational books and periodicals. The current focus is on publishing primary and secondary school textbooks.
    The publishing industry has made great contributions to the reform of almanacs this year. The new almanacs we have seen include: (1) "1951 Xinhua Almanac," a completely new type of almanac, for both rural and urban use, jointly distributed by Xinhua Bookstore and Tonglian Bookstore. The content is divided into four parts: calendar phenomena, politics and society, production and life, and cultural learning. Tonglian Bookstore separately prints the calendar phenomena section, named "1951 New Calendar." (2) "People's Republic of China Xinhua Agricultural Lunar Calendar Complete Book," a product of cooperation between some popular reading writers and Jia Wentang and Lao Er You Tang, the largest publishers of old almanacs in northern China. Its characteristic is that it completely utilizes the form of the old almanac to suit rural needs. (3) "1951 Farmer's Almanac," distributed by the Shandong Provincial Branch of Xinhua Bookstore. The content, in addition to a small part of calendar phenomena, is mostly popular agricultural science common sense. (4) "1951 Farmer's Almanac," published by Hebei People's Publishing House. The content is also mainly popular agricultural science common sense. The common features of these almanacs are: they have cleared away the feudal superstitious content in the old almanacs and added scientific common sense (agricultural common sense and health common sense) and political common sense.
    The Commercial Press published the revised edition of "Ciyuan" in December last year. "Ciyuan" was first published in 1915, the sequel was first published in 1931, and the combined edition of the original and sequel was first published in 1939. From the publication of the earliest version to the publication of the revised edition, thirty-five years have passed. The revised edition simplifies the original material and adds some new words; the old compound words have also been partially revised. The length has been reduced from 1,974 pages in the combined edition of the original and sequel to 1,174 pages. The printing and binding are very good. In terms of content, the publication of the revised edition of "Ciyuan" is meaningful today when there is an urgent need for comprehensive reference books but there is no more complete reference book yet. Not many new words are included in the book, and there are still incomplete and incorrect shortcomings in the explanation of some nouns. But these shortcomings do not obscure its significance today. The revised edition has two versions: 16mo and 23mo.
    "Hegel's Shorter Logic," translated and narrated by Professor He Lin of Peking University, was published by the Commercial Press in November 1950. This book is the complete translation of the first part of Hegel's famous book "Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences," "Logic." The main text of the book is 352 pages, with an introduction by the translator before the volume, which gives a brief explanation of the version on which the translation is based and the content of the book.
    Guangming Bookstore has recently published a translation of "On Socialist Culture" by Kalinin. The original book collects Kalinin's speeches on cultural issues to Soviet scientists, teachers, writers, and party, league, and youth masses from 1925 to 1938. The translation adds the article "The Way of Self-Study for Workers and Peasants," as well as several excerpts from "On Communist Education."
    Xinhua Bookstore has recently published two books on law. One is "State Law of People's Democratic Countries" by Farberov, translated by Dang Fengde and others. Based on Marxist-Leninist theory on state and law, it systematically introduces the emergence, development, and essence of various people's democratic countries, the characteristics of the constitutions of various countries, the leading role of the Communist Party in nation-building, and the reforms in political, social, economic, and cultural aspects. The other is "The Soviet People's Court" by Gorshenin, translated by Zhang Wenyun. This book analyzes in detail the basic differences in the organization, function, and business of bourgeois courts and Soviet courts, and describes the Soviet court organization and its position and importance in the Soviet judicial system. It is a reference material for studying the judicial system.
    Two famous books by Soviet geographer Mikhailov on Soviet geography have been translated into Chinese: one is "New Geography of the Soviet Union," published by Haiyan Bookstore in December 1949, and the other is "Soviet Geography," published by Tianxia Publishing House recently (originally named "On the Map of the Motherland"). The two books are written differently: the former uses the method of traveling on the map to describe the geographical features of the Soviet Union, combined with the tremendous changes in the Soviet national outlook, by region; the latter's content focuses on economic geography, outlining the great image of socialist construction in rapid progress in geography. Both books are equally imbued with a high degree of patriotism, and are good models for carrying out patriotic education in geography books.
    "Translation Bulletin," Volume 2, Issue 1, was published on the 15th of this month and will be publicly distributed from this issue. The content of this publication includes research and criticism on translation work, exchange of experience, and news reports. In this issue, a student from the Chemistry Department of Tsinghua University, Huang Fei, urgently appealed for Chinese translations of textbooks, reflecting a problem that needs to be solved urgently. The article "Comment on Mr. Xu Buheng's 'Compilation' Work" severely protested against the Shanghai Sanmin Book Company's September 1950 edition of "Principles of Soviet Jurisprudence," compiled by Xu Buheng, for its deliberate deletion, tampering, random writing, and poor translation of the original work, and demanded that the compiler and publisher thoroughly conduct self-examination. Criticism was also made of the Mass Bookstore edition of "The Leaping Soviet Union," translated by Fang Ken, pointing out that there are errors on almost every page of the translation, totaling no less than 250. (Note that this book was recommended in "Book Review," but errors were not found at the time because it was not compared with the original. We hereby remind readers to pay attention.)
    "Science and Technology Newsletter" has been renamed "Industrial Technology Newsletter" this year. The content focuses on basic industrial technology and is aimed at junior technicians. This change indicates a more detailed and specialized direction for the journal. In the "Experience Introduction" column of the first issue of the journal (General No. 16), there are three articles on the experience of new coal mining methods and three reports on the successful trial production, imitation, and repair of several industrial components. The content of the "Technical Knowledge" column also meets practical needs. The article "The Great Transformation of China's Heavy Industry" outlines the major transformation of China's heavy industry from imperialism and bureaucratic capitalism to the new people's heavy industry in 1950: the sharp increase in production, the democratization of management, and the planned nature mark the beginning of the elimination of the blind and backward state.
    The bimonthly "Soviet Woman," published in Moscow, has been printed in Chinese from the sixth issue (November-December 1950). This is a comprehensive social, political, and literary publication with rich pictures in each issue. The Chinese version of the sixth issue has now been shipped to China. From this issue, we can see how the people and women of the Soviet Union are actively participating in socialist construction and working hard to defend world peace.
    In the article "What Kind of Weapons Do Propagandists Need?" published on page 3 of this newspaper on January 19, it was proposed that the newspaper set up a "Propagandist Speech Column." In fact, Xi'an Mass Daily has opened a "Propagandist Column" in January and successively published articles entitled "What is the Task of Propagandists?" "Do a Good Job in Supporting the Army and Giving Preferential Treatment to Families of Soldiers," "We Can Carry Out Our Own Construction Without Relying on the 'Aid' of Capitalist Countries." Adding such a column is beneficial, and the newspaper should take helping propagandists as its own task. In areas where publications such as the "Propagandist Handbook" have been published, the newspaper's propagandist column should have appropriate division of labor and cooperation with the publication in terms of content.
    After Beijing Guangming Daily published Liang Shuming's "The Chinese Nation is a Miracle of Mankind" on January 1 this year, it successively published comments on the article by Wang Ming, Changzheng, and Zhang Lingguang on January 6, 9, and 12. On January 17, the newspaper published Liang Shuming's "Respectfully Answer to Readers" again, hoping that everyone would discuss the author's book "The Essentials of Chinese Culture" (published by Luming Bookstore, Banbianjie Road, Chengdu). This is a far-reaching theoretical controversy that deserves the attention of readers.
    Beijing Guangming Daily published Lu Hongji's article "Incoherent Uncle Sam" on January 10, which contained the phrase "Muhammad, who holds a sword in one hand and the classics in the other," which was used by a few bad elements in the city to carry out ethnic provocation. The Beijing Municipal Government convened a meeting of representatives of the Hui people in Beijing to resolve this issue. After the meeting, Professor Ma Jian of Peking University published an article "Muhammad's Sword" in Guangming Daily on January 19, giving a detailed explanation of this issue. This paper is very useful for strengthening the unity between Muslims and non-Muslims, and has been reprinted by this newspaper and broadcast by Xinhua News Agency.
    Since January 1, Shanghai Dagong Daily has opened a special column on the first page: "China's World First." In this column, the following topics have been published: "500 Million People," "Compass," "Mount Everest," "Gunpowder," "Great Wall," "Grand Canal," "Porcelain," "Printing," "Silk," "Soybean," "Abacus," "Tungsten," "Tea," "Jeme Tien Yow Hook," "Rice." It is meaningful to carry out propaganda in this area in a realistic rather than exaggerated way to help popularize patriotic education.
    Shanghai Xinwen Daily launched a discussion on "Are Yue Fei and Wen Tianxiang Great Patriots?" in the "Learning Life" supplement. Five articles have been published on January 10, including opinions from both sides. The editors stated: This discussion will continue, and explained: "If study groups can provide the results of group chats and discussions, this publication will give priority to publishing them with more space."

专栏：出版动态

　　出版动态
    为实现第一届全国出版会议决定的分工专业化的方针，在出版总署的领导下，于去年十二月成立了人民出版社。该社的专业方向是出版政治、时事读物和社会科学读物。一九五一年该社的主要工作任务，为：加强政治书籍、社会科学书籍和各种帮助干部学习的辅助读物的出版，并提高出版物的质量、政治性和严肃性。
    与人民出版社同时建立起来的，还有受教育部和出版总署共同领导的人民教育出版社。人民教育出版社的专业方针是出版教科书及一般教育书刊。目前的重点是出版中小学教科书。
    本年出版界在历书的改革方面有很大的贡献。我们已看到的新历书有：（一）“一九五一年新华通书”，这是一种完全新型的历书，农村城市两用，新华书店与通联书店共同发行。内容分历象、政治社会、生产生活及文化学习四个部分。通联书店另将历象部分单独印行，名“一九五一年新历本”。（二）“中华人民共和国新华农用阴阳合历全书”，这是一部分通俗读物作家与中国北方最大的旧历书出版者贾文堂、老二酉堂等合作的产品，它的特点是完全利用旧历书的形式，适合农村需要。（三）“一九五一年农家历”，新华书店山东总分店发行，内容除一小部分历象外，大部分是通俗的农业科学常识。（四）“一九五一年农家历”，河北省人民出版社出版，内容也是以通俗农业科学常识为主。这些历本的共同特色是：清除了旧历书中的封建迷信内容，增加了科学常识（农业常识和卫生常识）和政治常识。
    商务印书馆在去年十二月出版了“辞源”改编本。“辞源”于一九一五年初版，一九三一年续编初版，一九三九年正、续编合订本初版。从最早的版本的印行到改编本的出版，已历时三十五年。改编本精简了原有的材料，增补了一些新词；旧有的复词也作了局部的修改。篇幅从正续编合订本的一九七四页减缩为一一七四页。印刷、装帧都很好。就内容上说，在迫切需要综合性的工具书而又还没有一部更完善的工具书的今天，改编本“辞源”的出版是有意义的。书中新词收得不多，在有些名词的解释中，还存在着不完全和不正确的缺点。但这些缺点并没有掩盖它在今天的意义。改编本有两种版本：十六开本和二十三开本。
    北京大学教授贺麟译述的“黑格尔的小逻辑”由商务印书馆于一九五○年十一月出版。此书是黑格尔的名著“哲学全书”第一部“逻辑学”的全译本。全书正文三五二页，卷前有译者的引言，对翻译本书所根据的版本及本书内容有概略的说明。
    光明书局新近出了加里宁著“论社会主义文化问题”的译本。原书收集了加里宁从一九二五年到一九三八年间对苏联科学工作者、教师、作家以及党、团和青年群众所作的有关文化问题的讲演。译本加上了“工农自学的途径”一文，还有几篇从“论共产主义教育”中选译的文字。
    新华书店最近出版了两本有关法律的书籍。一本是法尔别洛夫著、党凤德等译的“人民民主国国家法”，根据马列主义关于国家与法律的理论，对各人民民主国家的产生、发展的本质，各国宪法的特点，共产党在建国中的领导作用，以及政治、社会、经济和文化各方面的兴革，作了有系统的介绍。另一本是高尔塞宁著、张文蕴译“苏维埃人民法院”，这本书详细分析了资产阶级法院和苏维埃法院的组织、作用以及业务上的基本不同，并叙述苏联的法院组织及其在苏维埃司法体系中的地位与重要性，是研究司法制度的参考资料。
    苏联名地理学者米哈伊诺夫两本关于苏联地理的名著都有了中译本：一本是海燕书店一九四九年十二月出版的“苏联新地理”，另一本是天下出版社最近出版的“苏联地理”，（原名“在祖国地图上”）。两书的写法不同：前一本是用地图上旅行的方式，将苏联地理上的特征，结合着苏联国家面貌的巨大变化，分区叙述；后一本的内容侧重在经济地理方面，勾划出飞跃前进中的社会主义建设在地理上的伟大形象。两本书都同样贯串着高度的爱国主义的精神，是在地理书籍中进行爱国主义教育的良好的范型。
    “翻译通报”二卷一期，本月十五日出版，从这一期起公开发行。这个刊物的内容有关于翻译工作的研究批评、经验交流与消息报告等。本期中清华大学化学系的一个学生——黄非，迫切地提出了要求教科书的中译本的呼吁，反映了当前急待解决的一个问题。“评徐步衡先生的‘编译’工作”一文，对上海三民图书公司一九五○年九月版、徐步衡编译的“苏联法学原理”有意删削、窜改原著，乱写、乱译的恶劣态度提出严重的抗议，要求编译者及出版者彻底进行自我检讨。对大众书店版、方垦译的“飞跃中的苏联”，也提出了批评，指出译文几乎每页都有错误，总计不下二百五十多处。（按本书曾在“图书评论”上推荐过，当时没有对照原本，未能发现错误，特附带在这里提请读者注意。）
    “科学技术通讯”，自本年起改名“工业技术通讯”，内容以基本工业技术为范围，以初级技术人员为对象。这一改变表示了期刊更细密的专业化的方向。该刊第一期（总十六号）在“经验介绍”一栏中，有三篇关于新式采煤法经验和三篇关于几种工业机件试制、仿造、修理成功的报告。“技术知识”一栏的内容也切合实际需要。“在转变中的中国重工业”一文概述了一九五○年中国重工业从帝国主义、官僚资本主义手里过渡到新的人民的重工业的重大转变：生产量的急剧增加、管理民主化和计划性这三大特征标志了盲目落后状态的开始消灭。
    莫斯科出版的“苏联妇女”双月刊从第六期（一九五○年十一月——十二号）起印行中文版。这是一个社会政治和文艺的综合性刊物，每期有丰富的图片。第六期的中文版现已运到中国，从本期中可以看到苏联的人民与妇女怎样积极地参加社会主义的建设工作并为保卫世界持久和平而努力。
    本报一月十九日第三版发表的“宣传员需要怎样的武器？”一文中，提议报纸设“宣传员讲话专栏”。事实上西安群众日报已在一月份辟了一个“宣传员专栏”，陆续发表了题为“宣传员的任务是什么？”“做好拥军优属工作”，“我们不依靠资本主义国家的‘援助’，能够进行自己的建设”的几篇文章。增加这样一个专栏是有益的，报纸应该把帮助宣传员当做自己的任务。在出版了“宣传员手册”一类刊物的地区，报纸的宣传员专栏应该和刊物在内容上有适当的分工和合作。
    北京光明日报在今年一月一日发表梁漱溟“中华民族是人类一奇迹”一文后，在一月六日、九日、十二日先后发表了王明、长征、张凌光对该文的评论。一月十七日该报又发表梁漱溟“敬答各读者”一文，希望大家就作者所著“中国文化要义”（成都半边街路明书店发行）一书进行讨论。这是牵涉很广的理论性的争论，值得读者注意。
    北京光明日报一月十日载卢洪基“语无伦次的山姆大叔”一文，内有“一手执剑一手执经典的穆罕默德”一语，曾被市内少数不良分子借以进行民族挑拨，北京市政府曾为此召集北京市回民代表会议加以解决。会后北京大学教授马坚在一月十九日光明日报发表“穆罕默德的宝剑”一文，对这个问题作了详细的解释。这篇论文对于加强回教徒和非回教徒的团结很有作用，已由本报转载并由新华社广播。
    一月一日起，上海大公报在第一版辟了一个专栏：“中国的世界第一”。在这一栏中已经发表了这样一些题目：“五万万人口”，“指南针”，“额菲尔士峰”，“火药”，“长城”，“大运河”，“陶瓷器”，“印刷术”，“蚕丝”，“大豆”，“算盘”，“钨”，“茶”，“詹天佑钩”，“米”。实事求是地而不是浮夸地进行这方面的宣传，以帮助普及爱国教育，是有意义的。
    上海新闻日报在“学习生活”副刊中展开了“岳飞、文天祥是伟大的爱国主义者吗？”的讨论，一月十日已发表了五篇文章，包括正反两面的意见。编者表示：这讨论将继续下去，并说明：“如果有学习小组能把小组漫谈和讨论后的结果提供出来，本刊将以较多篇幅尽先加以刊载。”
