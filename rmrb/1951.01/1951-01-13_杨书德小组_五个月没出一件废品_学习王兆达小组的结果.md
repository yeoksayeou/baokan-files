　　Yang Shude Group
    Five Months Without a Single Defective Product
    Results of Learning from the Wang Zhaoda Group
    [Our dispatch] The Yang Shude production group of a certain factory in the Lushun-Dalian area has humbly learned the advanced working methods of the industrial labor model Wang Zhaoda production group, and as a result, has not produced a single defective product for five consecutive months. This group is composed of young workers who regard the working methods of the Wang Zhaoda group as their own work guide. Yang Shude, the group leader, is familiar with the work specialties and machine efficiency of each worker in the group, so he can distribute work reasonably. For example, Shang Yanzeng's lathe has a slow wheel, which is not convenient for working on cast iron, so he is always assigned to work on wrought iron; Song Dadi's lathe cannot thread, but it is good for boring, cutting pads, etc. Yang Shude distributes tasks according to these conditions, reducing deviations in production. Yang Shude keeps a close watch on the work. As soon as the blueprint tasks are assigned, he immediately prepares the raw materials and tools. For example, not long ago, the group received a batch of small iron shovel tasks. As soon as the blueprint was down, Yang Shude took the lead in preparing the dies; as soon as the dies were ready, the materials came down. This avoids the waste of working hours. In order to prevent the production of defective products, the workers in the group conscientiously implemented the system of sending the first piece of work to the group leader and inspectors for inspection; when workers in other groups produced defective products, they also took them as lessons learned and studied them carefully. For example, when Wang Renmin, a worker from another group, ruined dozens of small screws, the workers in the group held a meeting to discuss and study the reasons, which not only helped themselves more, but also aroused the attention of the workers in the group. Another characteristic of the group is that it can unite and help each other. Taking the borrowing of tools as an example, if a certain tool is needed, as long as it is mentioned at the group meeting, whoever has it will take it out. For example, Yang Shude needed a thread turning tool for the inside of the car, and if he had to modify it with other turning tools, it would take a long time. As a result, the worker Ma Yuanbao lent him the thread turning tool for the inside of the car, saving a lot of working hours. At the same time, because the tasks in the workshop are not normal, there is often a phenomenon of you being busy and me being idle, so the workers who are idle take the initiative to help the workers who are busy with odd jobs. For example, the worker Ma Yuanbao helped Sun Deliang thread when he had no work to do; Song Dadi helped Yan Maurui collect oil and materials when he had no work to do. Thanks to their humble learning and mutual help, the workers in the group did not produce a single defective product for five months from August 1 to the end of December last year.

　　杨书德小组
    五个月没出一件废品
    学习王兆达小组的结果
    【本报讯】旅大地区某工厂杨书德生产小组，虚心地学习了工业劳动模范王兆达生产小组的先进工作方法，因而连续五个月没出一件废活。该组都是青年工人，把王兆达组的工作方法作为自己的工作指南。杨书德组长能熟悉全组每个工人的工作特长和机器效能，因此在分配活时能够分得合理。如尚严增的床子慢轮不好，不便于干生铁活，因此每次都给他熟铁活干；宋大弟的床子不能车丝，但瓦好，能挖眼、切垫等。杨书德根据这些条件进行分配任务，减少了生产中的偏差。杨书德对工作抓得很紧，凡图纸任务下来以后，马上就准备原材料，准备工具。如不久以前，该组接到一批小铁锨任务，图纸还刚下来，杨书德就带头准备胎具；胎具正做好，料就下来了。这样就避免了工时的浪费。为防止废品产生，该组工人认真执行了第一个活送交组长及检查员检查的制度；别组工人如出了废活时，他们也同样拿来作为经验教训，认真学习。如别组工人王仁敏干小螺丝活废了好几十个，该组工人就开会讨论，研究原因，不但自己能得到更多的帮助，同时也引起了组内工人们的注意。该组再有一个特点是能团结互助，就拿借用工具来讲，如需用某种工具时，只要在小组会上一提，谁有谁就拿出来了。如杨书德须用车里眼丝刀，若用别的车刀改的话，就须要花费很长的时间，结果工人马元宝把车里眼丝刀借给他用了，节省了很多工时。同时在工作中因为该车间的任务不正常，常有你忙我闲的现象，因此工作闲的工人就主动帮助工作忙的工人干零活。如马元宝工人没有活干就去帮助孙德良车丝；宋大弟没活干就去帮助阎茂瑞领油、领料等。该组工人由于虚心学习，团结互助，从去年八月一日到十二月底五个月没出一件废品。
