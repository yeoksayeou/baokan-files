Over Ten Thousand Catholics in Various Regions Respond to the Reform Movement
    The Movement in Areas Like Suiyuan is Developing Towards Rural Areas
    [Report from this newspaper] The patriotic movement for the independent and self-governing reform of Catholicism in China is gradually unfolding. Since the declaration of the "Self-Governing Reform Movement" by more than 500 Catholics led by Chinese priest Wang Liangzu in Guangyuan County, northern Sichuan, on November 30 last year, various regions have responded enthusiastically. According to current incomplete statistics, more than 15,000 Catholics across the country have signed in support. If the number of people participating in parades or jointly signing with Christians is included, the number would be even greater. This movement, which started in Guangyuan County, Sichuan, has spread to Kunming, Chongqing, Guilin, Guangzhou, Nanchang, Linchuan, Wuhan, Hangzhou, Kaifeng, Tianjin, Baoding, Qingdao, Jinan, Taiyuan, Zhangjiakou, Tianshui, Fushun, as well as Suiyuan, Hainan Island, and other places. The independent and self-governing reform signing movement of Catholicism in areas such as Suiyuan and Sichuan has penetrated into rural areas. Catholics in Baoding, Qingdao, Zhangjiakou, Kaifeng, Kunming, and Suiyuan held patriotic demonstrations and parades, issuing patriotic declarations. The Tianjin Municipal Preparatory Committee for the Reform Movement Promotion Association was established and began collecting signatures. On January 12 alone, 100 people participated in the signing, and the current number of signatories has reached 249. The Hangzhou Diocese established a Reform Movement Committee, calling on all members of the diocese to take action in their respective positions. The Taiyuan Diocese established a preparatory committee for the Resist America, Aid Korea Patriotic Movement on the 20th of this month, issued a Resist America, Aid Korea Patriotic Declaration, and called on the Catholic Church in the entire province to resolutely sever ties with American imperialism. By the 21st, the number of signatories had reached more than 3,900. The Suiyuan Diocese established a Three-Self Patriotic Promotion Association on January 8 to lead the reform movement towards rural development; in the villages near Shaba Town in the Sui West Diocese, 1,200 Catholics participated in the signing on the afternoon of January 6.

    Some Catholics in some regions have also formulated patriotic covenants. Catholics in Dazhou County, northern Sichuan, formulated ten patriotic covenants, Catholics in Jinan formulated six patriotic covenants, and Catholics in Zhangjiakou formulated five patriotic covenants. In these patriotic covenants, they all expressed their determination to heighten vigilance, distinguish between friend and foe, resolutely resist deception and exploitation by American imperialism, and resolutely eliminate imperialist elements and spies within the church.

    Some Catholics in some regions held symposiums, exposing the essence of American imperialism's use of the church to invade China, and cited the facts of American-Chiang spies activities in Qiqihar, Shenyang, Xingtai in Hebei, and Zhangjiazhuang in Xian County, to prove that many foreign missionaries, under the guise of spreading religion, were actually engaged in espionage work for American imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, endangering the Chinese people. Zhang Xinyuan, a representative of Catholics in Baoding, said: "We must be vigilant against spies in the church, expose them at any time, and eliminate them." Catholics in Nanchang said: "The teachings of our Catholicism are about loving peace and loving the motherland, but imperialism always wants to use our religion as a tool for cultural aggression. We must fight to maintain the sanctity of the church and to shatter the shackles that American imperialism has placed upon us."

    Judging from the current situation, this movement has gradually unfolded in many regions across the country. In some regions, such as Suiyuan and Sichuan, Catholics have decided to set up various production organizations under possible conditions in order to achieve self-sufficiency. They have also established study groups to conduct political learning, thoroughly eliminate pro-American, worship-American, and fear-American thinking that still remains in the church, and resolutely launch the patriotic movement of Three-Self reform. At the same time, some regions are brewing to launch the movement, while others have not yet launched the reform movement, but all patriotic Catholics and patriotic church leaders at all levels will inevitably actively participate in this movement, push this movement forward, and strive to establish an independent, self-supporting, and self-propagating Chinese Catholic Church.

　　各地万余天主教徒响应革新运动
    绥远等地的运动正向农村发展
    【本报讯】全国天主教自立革新的爱国主义运动逐渐展开。自去年十一月三十日川北广元县中国神父王良佐领导五百余天主教徒发表《自立革新运动宣言》以后，各地纷纷响应。据目前不完全的统计，全国已有一万五千多天主教徒签名响应。如将参加游行的，或与基督教人士联合签名的人数统计在内，则为数更多。这一运动，从四川广元县开始，已扩展至昆明、重庆、桂林、广州、南昌、临川、武汉、杭州、开封、天津、保定、青岛、济南、太原、张家口、天水、抚顺及绥远、海南岛等地。绥远和四川等地区天主教的自立革新签名运动已深入到农村。保定、青岛、张家口、开封、昆明和绥远等地区的天主教徒举行了爱国示威大游行，发表了爱国宣言。天津市成立了革新运动促进会筹备会，展开签名，在一月十二日一天内参加签名的有一百人，目前签名人数已达二百四十九人。杭州教区成立了革新运动委员会，号召全区教友在本岗位上行动起来。太原教区于本月二十日成立抗美援朝爱国运动筹备会，发表抗美援朝爱国宣言，号召全省天主教会坚决与美帝国主义割断关系，至二十一日签名人数已达三千九百多人。绥远教区于一月八日成立了三自爱国促进会，领导革新运动向农村发展；绥西教区陕坝镇附近各村庄教徒在一月六日下午就有一千二百人参加了签名。
    有些地区的天主教人士并制订了爱国公约。川北达县天主教人士订立了十项爱国公约，济南市天主教人士订立了六项爱国公约，张家口天主教人士订立了五项爱国公约。在这些爱国公约中，他们都表示要提高警惕，分清敌友，坚决不受美帝国主义的欺骗和利用，坚决清除教内的帝国主义分子和间谍分子。
    有些地区的天主教人士举行了座谈会，揭露了美帝国主义利用教会侵略中国的实质，并以东北齐齐哈尔、沈阳、河北邢台和献县张家庄等地的美蒋间谍活动的事实，来证明有很多外国的传教士以传教为名，实际担任美帝国主义和国民党反动派的特务工作，危害中国人民。保定市教友代表张鑫元说：“我们要警惕教会中的特务分子，随时检举他们，把他们清除出去。”南昌天主教徒们说：“我们天主教的教义本是爱和平、爱祖国的，可是帝国主义却总想利用我教来作为文化侵略的工具。我们要为保持教会的圣洁，为击碎美帝国主义所给予我们的枷锁而斗争。”
    根据目前情形看来，这一运动已在全国不少地区内逐渐开展了，有些地区如绥远、四川等地的天主教徒为了实行自养，决定在可能条件下筹设各种生产组织，并且成立了学习小组，进行政治学习，彻底肃清教会中还遗留着的亲美、崇美、恐美的思想，坚决展开三自革新的爱国主义运动。同时，有些地区则正在酝酿发动，有的地区则还没有发动革新的运动，但所有爱国的天主教徒以及爱国的各级教务主持人，也必然会积极地参加这一运动，把这一运动向前推进一步，为建立自治、自养、自传的中国天主教会而奋斗。
