　　[Reported by this newspaper] The broad masses of people in major cities such as Guangzhou, Nanjing, and Tianjin are extremely excited about the arduous battles and repeated brilliant victories of the Chinese and Korean People's forces, which have inflicted devastating blows on the American aggressor army, and they are donating money and goods to express their condolences.
　　The Guangzhou industrial and commercial community held a meeting on January 7 to celebrate the liberation of Seoul, and launched a donation campaign on the spot to offer condolences. With incomparable excitement, industrial and commercial figures at the meeting scrambled to shout out the amount of condolence money they pledged to donate; within two hours, a total of over 410 million yuan was pledged. Many extremely moving scenes appeared during the donation. Luo Hongduan, the representative of Dongxinglong Store, said: "I am already sixty-two years old, and I have witnessed that since the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty, the Chinese people have for the first time given the aggressors such a head-on blow, which is truly uplifting! Although my store is small, I am willing to do my best to donate one million yuan." Chen Quan, the representative of the pork industry, pledged 25 million yuan on behalf of the industry. Many manufacturers automatically added to their donations after pledging. For example, Shanghai Savings Bank and China Industrial Bank each increased from 10 million yuan to 15 million yuan, earning enthusiastic applause from the audience.
　　The Preparatory Committee for the Guangzhou Women's Labor Military Donation Movement held its first meeting on the 7th, resolving to launch a "one person, one thousand yuan" movement among the women, and decided to suggest to the Guangzhou Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression to expand the donation movement through means such as selling flags, selling flowers, selling commemorative badges, charity performances, and charity sales.
　　The people of Nanjing are enthusiastically comforting the Chinese and Korean People's forces. The first batch of comfort goods, carrying the Nanjing people's infinite love for the peace defenders, has been shipped to Korea. According to statistics, as of January 5, the Nanjing Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression has received 43,756,000 yuan in consolation money, 33,629 consolation bags, 26,887 consolation letters, and a large number of other consolation items. People sincerely offered their beloved items needed by the front-line soldiers, such as gloves, towels, socks, boots, shoes, soap, toothbrushes, harmonicas, fountain pens, diaries, and other supplies, as well as pocket-sized Party constitutions, banners, telescopes, and other items with profound meaning and encouraging significance. In the consolation letters, people encouraged the soldiers: everything for victory, everything for defending lasting world peace, everything for defending the fruits of victory, everything for the happiness of future generations; we will always support you.... In addition, the city's medical community also donated 1,000 bottles of penicillin.
　　The "Thousand Yuan Comfort the Troops Movement" initiated by all walks of life in Tianjin to comfort the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers fighting on the Korean front has gradually unfolded. Workers were the first to respond. Employees of eight departments, including printing and cutting tobacco, at Yizhong Tobacco Company have donated more than 2.6 million yuan. Workers in the eighth group of the cutting tobacco department each voluntarily donated 10,000 yuan. Workers in the third workshop and bobbin workshop of the state-owned Textile Machinery Factory donated 380,000 yuan in twenty minutes. Cadres and students have also joined the donation upsurge. On the 9th, at the meeting of the chairmen of various industries of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, Bi Mingqi, vice chairman of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, called on everyone to donate enthusiastically, and all participants expressed their agreement. Representatives of the industrial and commercial communities in the Fourth District have established an Anti-American Aid Korea Charity Performance Committee, which will use all the income from charity performances to comfort the Chinese and Korean People's forces. Many citizens are also actively donating.
