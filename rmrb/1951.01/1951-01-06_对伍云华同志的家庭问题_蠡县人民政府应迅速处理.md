On Comrade Wu Yunhua's Family Issues
    Lixian People's Government Should Handle Promptly
    Our newspaper correspondent Comrade Fu Weizong wrote a letter, pointing out that the Lixian People's Government in Hebei Province does not pay attention to the family issues that the honored serviceman Wu Yunhua requested to be resolved. Comrade Wu Yunhua is from Dabaichi Village, Lixian County. Last May, he received a letter from home, talking about his wife and child. Comrade Wu's organization sent a letter to the Lixian People's Government requesting an investigation and handling of the situation, but the matter was delayed and unresolved. In late November, Comrade Wu's younger brother wrote a letter saying, "Regarding your child's matter, I have negotiated with the county several times, but there has been no result."
    The Lixian People's Government should investigate based on Comrade Wu's letter and promptly reply to Comrade Wu Yunhua with the results of the handling. It is wrong to delay the problem for more than half a year without effectively dealing with it.

### 对伍云华同志的家庭问题  蠡县人民政府应迅速处理

　　对伍云华同志的家庭问题
    蠡县人民政府应迅速处理
    本报通讯员傅惟倧同志来信，指出河北蠡县人民政府对于荣誉军人伍云华要求解决的家庭问题，不予重视。伍云华同志系蠡县大百尺村人。去年五月他得到家信，谈到他老婆和孩子问题。伍同志所在机关曾据情函请蠡县人民政府调查处理，但事情拖延不决，十一月下旬，伍同志的弟弟来信说：“关于你那孩子的问题，我曾往县里交涉了数次，也没有一个结果。”
    蠡县人民政府应该根据伍同志的来信予以调查，并将处理结果迅速答复伍云华同志。将问题拖延半年以上不予切实处理是不对的。
