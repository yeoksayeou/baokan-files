Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 10th: The Chongqing business community, in the recent movement to resist America and aid Korea, demonstrated patriotic zeal and completely fulfilled the 1950 tax revenue task. Due to the late liberation and a weak work foundation, Chongqing's 1950 tax revenue, as of the end of September last year, had only reached 48%. However, since the launch of the movement to resist America and aid Korea, tax revenue deposited has rapidly increased. In December of last year, the Chongqing business community further launched the "Annual Tax Cleared Annually, Pay Off All Arrears" campaign, and all outstanding taxes from 1950 and industrial and commercial taxes from each quarter were therefore completely deposited into the treasury by the end of last year.

    清缴税款运动胜利结束
    【新华社重庆十日电】重庆工商界在最近抗美援朝运动中发扬爱国热忱，全部完成一九五零年税收任务。由于解放较晚，工作基础较差，重庆市一九五零年税收截至去年九月底止，仅完成百分之四十八。但自抗美援朝运动展开后，税收入库数字即迅速增加。去年十二月重庆市工商界更展开“年税年清、缴完尾欠”运动，一九五○年全年各项欠税及各季工商业税因此即在去年年底全部入库。
