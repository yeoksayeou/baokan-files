　　Economic Life Dynamics
    Cotton Producing Area of Hebei and Grain Producing Area of Chahar Province Sign Materials Exchange Agreement
    In order to regulate the supply and demand of grain and cloth between the cotton-producing area of Handan, Hebei, and the grain-producing area of Chahar Province, a credit mutual assistance agreement for the exchange of major materials was signed. In order to promote the exchange and mutual assistance of grain and cloth between the North and the South as soon as possible, the local federations of industry and commerce have established commercial information communication links and introduce each other's local product supply and sales information at any time, so that local products can be exchanged quickly.
    Meng County, Pingyuan Province Actively Seeks Sales Channels for Native Cloth
    The Meng County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Pingyuan Province recently raised 150 million yuan with the Xinxiang Special District Cooperative to purchase native cloth and set up a promotion station in Jincheng, Shanxi, so that the native cloth could be sold well. This has aroused the enthusiasm of the members in textile production and effectively supported the production of the handicraft textile industry.
    Guangdong Receives 6.6 Billion in Water Conservancy Loans
    In order to build farmland water conservancy to meet this year's spring plowing, the Guangdong Branch of the People's Bank of China allocated 6.6 billion yuan in water conservancy loans to Guangdong Province this year. It is estimated that this loan will benefit one million mu of farmland.
    Suiyuan Grain Company Stores Grain Well
    Last year, the Suiyuan Province Grain Company stored a total of 144.3 million jin of grain, with a regular storage quantity of about 30 million jin. Although the grain depots were very lacking, and 80% of the grain had to be stored in the open air, thanks to the efforts of the custodians, who worked tirelessly day and night patrolling and turning the grain, only nine jin of grain were mildewed throughout the year, and only two hundred and forty-six jin were half-mildewed. This working spirit of cherishing national property is worthy of learning and promoting.
    Shunchang, Fujian Has Arrears in Public Grain
    Shunchang County, Fujian, completed 5.3 million jin of autumn grain collection in just over twenty days, accounting for 72 percent of the total task, but the amount of arrears is also very large. Attention should be paid to this, and the arrears should be cleared up in a timely manner.
    Hebei Will Exchange Huge Amounts of Materials with Neighboring Areas
    The Hebei Provincial Cooperative held a meeting of trade section chiefs of special district cooperatives on January 3. In addition to conveying the spirit of the Central Cooperative Trade Conference and discussing the trial implementation of the allocation method, it also discussed the signing of a material exchange agreement with neighboring area cooperatives worth over 144 billion yuan. This huge amount of material exchange will create favorable conditions for this year's agricultural production increase and disaster relief work in the province. The meeting also made a more detailed direct transportation plan for this material exchange. According to preliminary calculations, a single commodity can save more than 3 billion yuan in transportation costs.
