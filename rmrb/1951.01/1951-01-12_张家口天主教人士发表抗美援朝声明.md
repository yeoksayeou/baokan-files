　　Zhangjiakou Catholic Figures Issue Statement on Resisting America and Aiding Korea
    [This newspaper reported] Catholic figures in Zhangjiakou City recently organized a patriotic demonstration parade, established a patriotic covenant, and issued a statement on resisting America and aiding Korea, led by priests Hao Jinxiu, Song Liande, Li Xiangrong, Li Dexin, Yang Wenyao, and Wu Puliu. The full text of the statement is as follows:
    The patriotic movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country has been vigorously launched throughout the country. Various democratic parties, people from all walks of life, and people's organizations have successively issued declarations, expressing their determination to resist America and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend our country. We, the Catholics of Zhangjiakou City, hereby make the following statement:
    First, we warmly support Foreign Minister Zhou's statement, oppose the American invasion of Taiwan and Korea, firmly advocate that all foreign troops withdraw from Korea, that Korean internal affairs should be resolved by the Korean people themselves, that the American invading army must withdraw from Taiwan, and that our country's representatives must obtain a legitimate position in the United Nations.
    The Chinese people have always loved peace. If any country treats us with equality and mutual benefit, it is our friendly country, and of course we will be friendly to it; if it invades our territory, enslaves our people, and threatens our security, it is an imperialist and our mortal enemy. We not only cannot be friendly to it, but we will resolutely resist it to the end!
    According to current facts, the United States is unreasonably invading our Taiwan and using force to interfere in Korea's internal affairs. This is obviously an imperialist act, and every Chinese, regardless of race or belief, must unite to resist it.
    At the same time, Korea is our brother country and is closely related to us. The American imperialists' invasion of Korea is a prelude to further invading our country and Asia. We are determined to make the American imperialists get out of Korean territory in order to achieve our goal of protecting our homes and defending our country.
    We are Catholics, but we are also Chinese people; we will never lag behind others in the cause of patriotism. We must be vigilant at all times and pay attention to all kinds of conspiracies of the imperialists. We will never allow the imperialists to use our religion as a tool of aggression! We must also express our enthusiasm for the construction of the new China with practical actions. Those of us who are engaged in agriculture must work hard to improve agriculture and accelerate production; workers must intensify their studies and improve their skills; those who run education must learn from the Soviet Union and other advanced countries to cultivate useful talents for the new China; those who serve in the health care cause must implement the principle of "prevention is better than cure and serving workers, peasants and soldiers" in order to reduce the mortality rate of the Chinese people and promote the health of the broad masses of the people. We put forward the following slogans:
    We will never let the imperialists occupy an inch of our land!
    All peace-loving people across the country unite to oppose American imperialist aggression!
    Support lasting world peace!

　　张家口天主教人士发表抗美援朝声明
    【本报讯】张家口市天主教人士于日前组织了爱国示威游行，订立了爱国公约，并以神甫郝进修、宋连德、李向荣、李德馨、杨文耀、吴璞六人领衔发表抗美援朝声明。声明全文如下：
    抗美援朝、保家卫国的爱国运动，已在全国各地蓬勃开展。各民主党派、各界人民、各人民团体，都先后发表宣言，表示抗美援朝保家卫国的决心。我们张家口市天主教徒特作以下声明：
    首先，我们热烈拥护周外长的声明，反对美国侵略台湾与朝鲜，坚决主张一切外国军队自朝鲜撤出，朝鲜的内政应由朝鲜人民自己去解决，美国侵略军必须退出台湾，我国代表必须取得联合国合法地位。
    中国人民一向是爱好和平的，任何国家如果对我们以平等互惠，它便是我们的友好国家，当然我们也要和它友好；如果来侵略我国的领土，奴役我国的人民，威胁我国的安全，它就是帝国主义者，就是我们的死敌，我们不但不能和它友好，而且坚决反抗到底！
    根据目前的事实，美国无理侵略我国的台湾，武力干涉朝鲜的内政，这显然是帝国主义的行动，每个中国人不分种族、不分信仰，要一致抵抗它。
    同时，朝鲜是我们的兄弟国家，和我国有唇齿关系，美帝侵略朝鲜，是进一步侵略我国、侵略亚洲的先声，我们坚决要使美帝滚出朝鲜国土，以达到我们保家卫国的目的。
    我们是天主教人士，但同时也是中国人民；我们在爱国的事业上决不后人。我们要随时随地提高警惕，注意帝国主义者的各种阴谋。决不容许帝国主义者利用我们宗教作为侵略的工具！我们并要以实际行动来表现我们对新中国建设的热情。我们务农的要努力改进农业，加紧生产；工人要加紧学习，提高技术；办教育的要向苏联及其他先进国家学习，为新中国培养有用的人才；服务于卫生保健事业的，要实行“预防胜于治疗和面向工农兵”的方针，以达到减低中国人民的死亡率，及促进广大人民健康的目的。我们提出以下的口号：
    我们决不让帝国主义者侵占我国一寸土地！
    全国爱好和平的人士一致团结起来，反对美帝国主义侵略！
    拥护世界持久和平！
