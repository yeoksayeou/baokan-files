(Report from our newspaper) The Wen County People's Government in Pingyuan Province, in order to vigorously promote commodity exchange, convened a county-wide conference of representatives from commerce and handicraft industries in mid-December of last year, and decided to organize mass commodity exchange through the use of various operating contracts. The county annually produces approximately 1.1 million catties of Chinese yam and rehmannia root, and also needs to sell large quantities of sesame seeds and peanuts. In terms of demand, the masses annually need 7.2 million catties of coal, still lack over 10,000 pieces of agricultural implements, need to dig 300 wells, and require bricks, tiles, and other building materials. To address these needs, the representatives discussed and decided to establish an iron and wood factory to promote new-style agricultural implements; restore seven or eight brick and tile kilns, oil mills, and flour mills for production; and universally organize portering, trade transport, and other side occupations. More importantly, the conference clarified the importance of the contract system based on past experience in operating native products. The representatives immediately signed contracts with each other, totaling twenty-five contracts between villages and county cooperatives, cooperatives and private merchants, handicraftsmen, markets and markets, and villages and towns. These contracts were divided into five types based on their nature: (1) Exchange contracts. Such as exchanging oilseeds for straw ropes, wooden pillars for coal, etc. For example, the West Gate Village cooperative used 300 catties of oil to exchange for 10,000 catties of coal from the Guanzhuang Coal Depot; (2) Ordering contracts. Mainly for ordering agricultural implements, bricks, etc. For example, the County Cooperative ordered 120 pieces of plows and other agricultural implements from a blacksmith in Guxian, paying 1,000 catties of grain; (3) Transportation and sales contracts. For example, the West Gate Village cooperative contracted with the Xubao Village cooperative for ten carts and 150 small carts to regularly transport coal; (4) Purchasing contracts. The County Supply and Marketing Cooperative sold grain to purchase cotton from the Water Conservancy Promotion Cooperative; (5) Consignment contracts. For example, the Zhaoxian Village cooperative contracted with the West Gate Village cooperative to sell 500 catties of salt on consignment, as well as daily necessities such as sesame oil and matches. These five types of contracts were all signed for a period of approximately three months and were all based on the principles of voluntariness, mutual benefit, and adherence to credit.

　　平原温县组织群众性物资交流
    商订合同组织联营
    【本报讯】平原省温县人民政府为大力开展物资交流，于去年十二月中旬召开全县商业、手工副业代表会议，通过运用各种合同经营，组织群众性的物资交流。该县每年产山药、地黄约一百一十余万斤，另有大芝麻、花生都需要推销出去。群众在需要方面，年需煤炭七百二十余万斤，农具尚缺万余件，需打井三百眼及需要砖瓦等建筑材料。为此，代表们讨论决定设立一个铁木工厂，以推广新式农具；并恢复砖瓦窑七、八座及油、粉房等生产，普遍组织挑担、贸易运输等副业。更重要的，会议根据过去经营土产的经验，明确了合同制的重要性。当场各代表互相订立合同，计有村社与县社、合作社与私商、手工业者、市场与市场、乡村与集镇共订立合同二十五件，从合同性质分为五种：（一）交换合同。如以油籽换草绳，木柱换煤等，西关村社用油三百斤换官庄煤栈煤一万斤；（二）订货合同。主要是订农具、砖等，如县社与古贤一铁匠订犁等农具一百二十件，付粮一千斤；（三）运销合同。如西关村社与徐堡村社订大车十辆，小车一百五十辆，经常运煤；（四）收购合同。县供销社卖了粮食去购买水利推进社的棉花；（五）代销合同。如招贤村社与西关村社订立合同让其代销食盐五百斤，还代销香油、火柴等日用品。这五种合同的订立，时间均在三个月左右；并且均是在自愿两利和坚守信用的基础上订立的。
