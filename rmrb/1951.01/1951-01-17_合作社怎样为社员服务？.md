How does the Cooperative Serve its Members?

　　Using the Purchase of Surplus Grain on Credit
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Lishu County Cooperative

The Lishu County Cooperative in Liaoxi province uses the method of purchasing surplus grain on credit to solve the problem of large quantities of surplus grain in rural areas, which is very popular among the masses. Last year, Lishu County had a bumper harvest, and the grain company set up four grain collection stations, but they could not collect all the grain. The funds of the cooperatives in various villages were limited, and the masses were in urgent need of selling grain. Under these circumstances, they came up with the idea of purchasing on credit. The cooperative would check the grade of the grain brought by the villagers, weigh it, calculate the price, and give the villagers a receipt for the grain sold. The cooperative would hire a cart to pull the grain to the grain station, sell it, and buy back cloth, necessities, and money. The payment for the grain sold would be cleared within three days at the latest. The masses all reflected that this method was perfect in every way: it was convenient for farmers to sell grain without suffering losses; the cooperative's funds increased; and the grain station saved trouble and collected more grain. Now, the Lishu County Cooperative is also using the method of purchasing sideline products on credit.

　　Developing Credit to Support Production
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Anyang Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative

The credit department of the Da'an Village Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Anyang County, Henan Province, loaned out a total of 5,200 jin of grain in the autumn and winter seasons to help members buy livestock, farm tools, and sideline production groups for transportation, felt workshops, and oil mills. Farmers Wang Yushan and Wang Xiuchen voluntarily combined to engage in sideline production, and the credit department loaned them 1,000 jin of wheat as capital; this led to the transformation of five agricultural mutual aid groups into sideline production groups. Due to the development of sideline production, the credit business has developed successively. According to a ten-day statistic, 13 households stored 6,150 jin of grain.

　　Organizing Sideline Production
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Wang Diankui

Under the organization of the cooperative, 120 out of 131 households in the Tongyi Village, Wa Yanzou Tun, Gongpeng District, Yushu County, Jilin Province, engaged in mat weaving production. They can produce 300 mats a day, and the products are sold by the cooperative. Until the beginning of January, the entire Tun has woven more than 12,000 mats, and more than 8,000 mats have been sold. Each mat can earn more than 54,000 yuan (Northeast currency) in addition to the raw materials, and the masses have benefited greatly.

　　Contacting State-Owned Enterprises to Solve the Needs of the Masses
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Chen Guang

The Beiyang Village area of Boye, Hebei Province is a cotton-producing area. The members urgently requested to sell cotton and purchase grain and coal. However, the cooperative had little funds and was unable to operate. They contacted various state-owned enterprises and purchased seed cotton on behalf of industrial companies and sold grain to members on behalf of grain companies. In a month and a half, they purchased a total of 30,000 jin of seed cotton from members and sold more than 70,000 jin of grain to members, which not only met the needs of the members but also solved the problem of insufficient funds for the cooperative.

    合作社怎样为社员服务？
    用赊购办法收余粮
                              梨树县社
    辽西梨树县合作社用赊购来解决农村大批余粮的办法，很受群众欢迎。去年梨树全县丰收，粮食公司设立了四处收粮栈都收不过来，各村合作社资金有限，当时群众又急需卖粮，在这种情况下，就想出了赊购的办法。合作社把老乡拉来的粮食验好等级，秤过分量，合出价钱，给老乡开个卖粮欠据。由合作社雇车拉到粮栈，卖完了给买回布匹、必需品和钱。最晚不超过三天还清卖粮欠款。群众都反映说，这个办法三全齐美：农民卖粮方便不吃亏；合作社资金增加；粮栈省事收粮又多。现在梨树县合作社又用赊购的办法来收副业产品了。
            发展信贷扶助生产
    安阳专区供销社
    河南安阳县大庵村供销社信贷部，在秋冬两季共贷出粮五千二百斤，扶助社员买牲口、农具，及运输、毡坊、油坊等副业生产小组。农民王玉山和王秀臣自愿结合搞副业生产，由信贷部贷麦子一千斤作资本；这就带动了五个农业互助组转成副业组。由于副业生产的开展，使信贷业务相继获得发展，据十天统计，就有十三户存粮六千一百五十斤。
    组织副业生产
                                王殿魁
    吉林榆树县弓棚区同意村挖眼沟屯，在合作社的组织下，全村一百三十一户中有一百二十户编席生产，一天可出席三百领，产品由合作社帮助推销。直到一月初，全屯编出席子一万二千多领，已推销出去八千多领。每领除原料可收入五万四千多元（东北币），群众得益很大。
    联系国营企业解决群众需要
                                  陈光
    河北博野北杨村一带是产棉区，社员们迫切要求推销棉花，购入粮、煤。但合作社资金小，无力经营，他们便和各国营企业取得联系，替实业公司代购籽棉，替粮食公司代售粮食。在一个半月内，共收购社员籽棉三万斤，代售与社员粮食七万多斤，既满足了社员的需要，也解决了合作社资金不足的困难。
