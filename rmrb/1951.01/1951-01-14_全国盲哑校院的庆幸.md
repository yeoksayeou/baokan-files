　　The Good Fortune of National Schools for the Blind and Deaf

　　At the end of last year, the State Council of the Central People's Government announced the policy of handling cultural, educational, relief organizations and religious groups accepting American subsidies. This included thirty schools for the blind and ten schools for the deaf, all of which were to be taken over by the China People's Relief Administration. This inaugurated an unprecedentedly fortunate new era in the history of deaf and blind education in China. This is because, during the century of American imperialist aggression, they used the reputation of schools for the blind and deaf as a false charitable gold signboard, and used the blind and deaf compatriots themselves as living advertisements for false compassion. This not only anesthetized the two to three thousand blind and deaf teachers and students in schools across the country, but also blinded the general public's view of hating American imperialism, and concealed its ferocious and aggressive face.

　　In the past, most schools for the blind and deaf in old China were subsidized by the United States, and served as decorations for the American imperialists' cultural aggression for more than seventy years. Some blind and deaf teachers and students even lived a lifeless life in superficially magnificent buildings in the land of their motherland, not knowing the great history of the motherland and the current bright and splendid affairs of the new China.

　　Participating in social progress activities was strictly prohibited for them, and discussing national politics was opposed. They were only taught English or the Bible. During the Anti-Japanese War, they were not even allowed to say a word about defeating Japanese imperialism. As for the issue of resisting America and aiding Korea, it was even more important to reverse right and wrong. Some even said: The Communist Party does not want disabled people, blind people, and deaf people; they will all be killed and starved to death. Although some enlightened teachers and students were dissatisfied with this kind of slave education and harbored a passion for loving the motherland, they ultimately could not break free from the shackles of American imperialist economic constraints.

　　It was not until the end of 1950 that the State Council passed Vice Premier Guo's proposal, completely shattering the shackles of American economic and cultural aggression against China for a hundred years.

　　The Communist Party, like the light of the sun, shines into every dark school for the blind and deaf across the country. Chairman Mao, like the kindness of parents, cares for every one of us blind and deaf people. Blind and deaf compatriots, let us rise up together and throw ourselves into the embrace of the motherland! Let us work hard and advance towards the road to a free and happy new China that Chairman Mao has opened up for us! From now on, we will not only not be social parasites, but on the contrary, we will study diligently and become new people who contribute to society.

### 全国盲哑校院的庆幸

　　全国盲哑校院的庆幸
    去年年底，中央人民政府政务院公布了处理接受美国津贴的文教救济机关及宗教团体的方针，其中包括了三十所盲校和十所哑校，均由中国人民救济总会全部予以接办，创始了中国哑盲教育史上空前荣幸的新纪元。因为在美帝国主义百年侵略过程中利用盲哑校院的名誉，作假慈善的金招牌，利用盲哑同胞的本身作假慈悲的活广告，不但麻醉了全国在校的二三千的盲哑师生，并且蒙蔽了一般人民恨美帝国主义的视线，掩盖了它狰狞侵略面目。
    过去旧中国盲哑校院，多数是受美国的津贴，做了美帝七十多年文化侵略的装饰品。有些盲哑师生甚至在祖国的土地上，不知道伟大的祖国历史和目前光辉灿烂新中国的时事，一天到晚把盲哑人关在表面富丽的大厦中过着死气沉沉的生活。
    参加社会的进步活动是他们所严禁的，讨论国家政治是他们所反对的，只教他们学英文或圣经。在抗日时期，连一句打倒日本帝国主义的话，都不准说，至于抗美援朝问题，更要颠倒是非了，并且有的竟说：共产党不要残废人，盲人，哑人，都要被杀死，饿死的。虽然有一部分觉悟的师生们，不满意这种奴化教育，怀着爱祖国的热情，但终挣脱不了美帝国主义经济束缚的绳索。
    直到一九五○年的岁底，政务院通过了郭副总理的提案，彻底粉碎了美国百年来对中国经济、文化侵略的枷锁。
    共产党像太阳的光芒，射到全国各个黑暗的盲哑校院里，毛主席像爹娘的慈爱，关顾到我们每一个盲哑人的身上了。盲哑同胞们，一起起来投向祖国的怀抱中吧！努力向着毛主席为我们开辟自由幸福新中国的大路上前进！今后我们不但不做社会寄生人，相反的要认真学习，作个对社会有贡献的新人民。
