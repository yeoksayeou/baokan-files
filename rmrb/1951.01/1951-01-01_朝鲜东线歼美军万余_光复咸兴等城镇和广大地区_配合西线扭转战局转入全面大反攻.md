Xinhua News Agency, 31st dispatch: Our correspondent on the Korean front reports: The Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army, fighting shoulder to shoulder in the northeastern region of Korea, have heavily struck the elite units of the American invading forces, the 1st Marine Division, the 7th Infantry Division, and the 3rd Infantry Division, with their iron fists. According to preliminary statistics, over 11,000 American invading troops were annihilated in this campaign, including over 1,000 captured alive. Although the American invading forces relied on superior air power, tanks, and artillery, and had the cover of naval fleet artillery and aircraft along the coast, they were still badly defeated under the hammering of the Chinese and Korean people's warriors. They abandoned supplies, tanks, and trucks, leaving corpses along the way. The Chinese and Korean people's warriors fought from the Changjin Lake area, and after more than 20 days of active encirclement, interception, and pursuit, fought directly to the Hamhung and Hungnam areas on the east coast, driving the American invading forces into the sea like ducks. When the U.S. Marine 1st Division and 7th Division were being divided and encircled in the Changjin Lake area, the American invading forces and the Li bandit troops who had once ventured to Chongjin and the Hyesan town area on the Yalu River also fled south in panic. By this point, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army had recovered the northeastern Korean towns and vast areas of Chongjin, Ranam, Kyongsong, Myongchon, Kilju, Songjin, Hyesan, Samsu, Kapsan, Pungsan, Tanchon, Iwon, Bukchong, Hongwon, Sinheung, Hamhung, Chongpyong, Yongheung, Kowon and Munchon, thereby coordinating with the victory on the western front, fundamentally changing the Korean war situation, and enabling themselves to enter a full-scale counteroffensive. In this campaign, the enemy unit designations that have been identified as annihilated include the tank battalion of the U.S. Marine 1st Division, infantry companies and most of the 5th and 7th Regiments, the entire 32nd Regiment of the U.S. 7th Infantry Division and the 3rd Battalion of the 31st Regiment, the 2nd Company of the 1st Battalion, the division headquarters howitzer battalion, and the entire 2nd Battalion of the 7th Regiment of the 3rd Division.

　　朝鲜东线歼美军万余
    光复咸兴等城镇和广大地区   
    配合西线扭转战局转入全面大反攻
    【新华社三十一日讯】本社朝鲜前线记者报道：中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军在朝鲜东北地区并肩作战中，用自己的铁拳沉重地打击了美国侵略军的精锐部队海军陆战第一师以及步兵第七师和步兵第三师。据初步统计，美国侵略军在这个战役中被歼灭了一万一千余人，其中被生俘的有一千余人。美国侵略军虽仗恃着优势的空军、坦克和大炮，在沿海地区并有海面舰队炮火、飞机的掩护，但在中朝两国人民勇士们的锤击下，美国侵略军仍被打了个大败。他们丢弃了辎重、坦克、卡车，一路上遗尸累累。中朝人民的勇士们从长津湖地区打起，经过二十多天的积极围击、切击、追击，直打到东部沿海咸兴、兴南地区，像赶鸭子一样，把美国侵略军赶下海去了。在美海军陆战一师和第七师在长津湖地区遭到分割围歼时，一度冒犯到清津和鸭绿江畔惠山镇一带的美国侵略军和李匪军也闻风丧胆、仓惶南逃。至此，我国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军就光复了朝鲜东北部的清津、罗南、镜城、明川、吉州、城津、惠山、三水、甲山、丰山、端川、利原、北青、洪原、新兴、咸兴、定平、永兴、高原、文川等城镇和广大地区，从而配合西线的胜利，根本改变了朝鲜战局，使自己转入了全线的大反攻。在这次战役中，被歼敌军番号已查明为美陆战一师坦克大队、步兵中队及五、七两团大部，美步兵第七师三十二团全部及三十一团第三营、第一营第二连，师部榴炮营，第三师七团二营等全部。
