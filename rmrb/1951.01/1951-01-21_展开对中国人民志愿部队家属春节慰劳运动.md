　　Launch a Spring Festival 慰劳 Movement for Families of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army

　　The Spring Festival of 1951 is approaching. Thanks to the heroic fighting of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, the people of the whole country can greet this festival with a victorious and joyful mood in a stable environment. During this festival, in order to express gratitude and respect to the families of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, people from all walks of life across the country should universally launch a 慰劳 movement.

　　The reason for launching such a 慰劳 movement is obvious. The people of the whole country clearly remember that when American imperialism launched its war of aggression against Korea, and the flames of war spread to our northeastern border, seriously threatening the security of our motherland, outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people formed the Volunteer Army and went to the Korean battlefield to valiantly resist the American aggressors in order to defend the sacred border of the motherland and support the Korean people. Their families gave them various encouragements and relieved them of all worries, enabling them to bravely step onto the front lines. In just over two months, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army, working together, overcame all kinds of unimaginable difficulties, achieved continuous and significant victories, annihilated large numbers of American and Li bandit troops, severely struck the American aggressors, and fundamentally reversed the situation in the Korean War. This glorious victory made a huge contribution to peace in Asia and the world, and boosted the confidence of people around the world in striving for lasting peace. It is precisely because of this brilliant victory that our people can today welcome the Spring Festival of 1951 in a stable environment. There is no doubt that this great achievement should be attributed to the soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army, who earned it with their blood, but it should also be attributed to the families of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, because for the sake of the safety of the motherland and the peaceful and happy lives of the people of the whole country, they encouraged their children to go to the front lines and took the burden of family production and life upon their own shoulders. This is the highest expression of glorious patriotism, and it should be thanked and respected by the people of the whole country. Farmers in Benxi County, Northeast China, and other places have spontaneously organized themselves to chop firewood, carry water, cut grass, feed livestock, and dump manure for the families of volunteer soldiers, and in their congratulatory letters to the volunteer soldiers, they encouraged them to "concentrate on attacking the American aggressors, we will definitely ensure that the lives of your families do not lag behind us." This approach is entirely correct. The people of all parts of the country should learn from the example of the farmers in Benxi and other places, and universally launch a movement to comfort the families of the Volunteer Army in the upcoming Spring Festival.

　　We believe that the movement to comfort the families of the Volunteer Army is an action with significant political meaning. It will not only encourage the families of the Volunteer Army, but also have a huge effect on encouraging the soldiers of the Volunteer Army to kill the enemy and strive for the early arrival of final victory.

　　The movement to comfort the families of the Volunteer Army is an in-depth ideological education work for the masses. People's organizations in all parts of the country should actively participate in and promote this movement, launch extensive publicity work to the broad masses, so that everyone understands the great contributions made by the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and their families to our country, and what kind of relationship they have with themselves, so that everyone understands the significance of carrying out the 慰劳 movement.

　　In view of the fact that some areas did not pay enough attention to publicity work in rural areas in the previous stage of the Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda work, special attention should be paid to the propaganda to the peasant masses in this 慰劳 movement, in order to set off a wave of enthusiasm for 慰劳 families of Volunteer Army soldiers in the vast countryside.

　　As for the scope of the 慰劳, it should include the families of the Volunteer Army who directly participated in the war, as well as the families of the rear service personnel and the civilian workers who supported the front lines. Although they shoulder different tasks, they are equally glorious. There are also some Korean overseas Chinese in the Chinese People's Volunteer Army whose families are in China, so their families should also be included.

　　When launching this movement, various localities can carry out material 慰劳 and spiritual comfort through various different methods, according to local customs, such as sending gifts, hanging honor plaques, hanging honor lanterns, sending New Year cards, as well as hosting movie and theater viewings, and holding various small-scale entertainment evenings. No matter what method is used, in short, the families of the Volunteer Army must feel that because their children participated in the glorious Volunteer Army, the people of the whole country are very grateful and respectful to them.

### 展开对中国人民志愿部队家属春节慰劳运动

　　展开对中国人民志愿部队家属春节慰劳运动
    一九五一年的春节即将来临。由于中国人民志愿部队的英勇作战，使全国人民得以在安定的环境里以胜利愉快的心情来迎接这一佳节。在这个节日里，为了表示对中国人民志愿部队家属的感谢和崇敬，全国各阶层人民应普遍展开一个慰劳运动。
    展开这样一个慰劳运动的理由是显然的。全国人民都还清楚地记得，在美帝国主义发动侵略朝鲜战争，把战火燃烧到我国东北边境、严重威胁我祖国安全的时候，中国人民的优秀子女组成志愿部队，开赴朝鲜战场，为保卫祖国的神圣边疆，支援朝鲜人民，英勇地抗击美国侵略军。对于他们的英雄行为，他们的家属给予了各种鼓励，免除了他们的一切顾虑，使他们英勇地走上前线。在短短的两个多月中，中国人民志愿部队和朝鲜人民军在一道，克服了种种想像不到的困难，连续取得重大胜利，重歼美李匪军，严重地打击了美国侵略者，根本扭转了朝鲜战争的局势。这一光辉的胜利，对于亚洲和世界的和平作了巨大贡献，鼓舞了全世界人民争取持久和平的信心。正由于这一辉煌的胜利，我国人民今天才能在安定的环境中迎接一九五一年的春节。毫无疑问，这一伟大的功勋应归于中国人民志愿部队和朝鲜人民军的战士们，这是他们用鲜血换来的，但同样也应归功于中国人民志愿部队的家属，因为他们为了祖国的安全和全国人民和平幸福的生活，鼓励自己的子女走上前线，而把家庭的生产和生活的担子放在自己肩上。这是光荣的爱国主义的最高表现，应该受到全国人民的感谢和崇敬。东北本溪县等地的农民，已自发地组织起来为自愿部队的家属打柴、挑水、切草、喂牲口和倒粪等，并在给志愿军战士们的慰问信中，鼓励他们“安心打击美国侵略者，我们一定保证你们家属的生活不落在我们的后面”。这种作法是完全应该的。全国各地人民，应该学习本溪等地农民的榜样，在即将到来的春节普遍展开慰劳志愿部队家属的运动。
    我们认为，慰劳志愿部队家属的运动，是一个富有重大政治意义的行动，它不但会鼓励志愿部队的家属，而且对于鼓励志愿部队战士们的杀敌情绪，争取最后胜利的早日到来，也有着巨大的作用。
    慰劳志愿部队家属的运动，是一个深入的群众思想教育工作。全国各地人民团体应该积极参加与推动这个运动，向广大群众展开广泛的宣传工作，使每一个人都了解到，中国人民志愿部队和他们的家属对于我们国家所作的伟大贡献，与自己有着什么样的关系，使每个人都了解到开展慰劳运动的意义。
    鉴于前一阶段的抗美援朝宣传工作，有些地区对农村的宣传工作注意不够，因此在这次慰劳运动中，应该十分注意对于农民群众的宣传，以便在广大农村掀起一个慰劳志愿部队家属的热潮。
    至于慰劳的范围，应该包括直接参战的志愿部队家属，以及后方勤务工作人员和支援前线的民工的家属，他们虽然担负着不同的工作，但同样是光荣的。在中国人民志愿部队中还有部分家在中国的朝鲜侨民，因此也应包括他们的家属在内。
    各地在展开这一运动的时候，可根据各地的风俗习惯，通过各种不同的方式，进行物质慰劳与精神慰问，如送礼，挂光荣匾，挂光荣灯，送贺年片，以及招待看电影、看戏，召开各种小型娱乐晚会等。不论运用何种方式，总之要使志愿部队家属感到：因为他们的子女参加了光荣的志愿部队，全国人民对于他们都十分的感谢和尊敬。
