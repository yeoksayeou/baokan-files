The Chinese and Korean People's Forces Continue Their Victorious Advance Southward

The new offensive launched by the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers on New Year's Eve is developing victoriously. After the liberation of Seoul, the capital of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, on January 4, the Chinese and Korean People's Forces successively liberated important cities such as Incheon, Suwon, Wonju, Yeoju, Yongin, and Icheon. According to preliminary statistics, as of January 7, the Chinese and Korean People's Forces had annihilated more than 10,000 American aggressors and Syngman Rhee's puppet troops in this new offensive, advancing more than 300 li. Currently, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers are continuing their victorious advance southward, fighting for the liberation of the entire Korea; while the routed American aggressor troops and Syngman Rhee's puppet troops are fleeing southward in a panic.

The people of the entire Korea, the entire China, and the entire world are cheering for this new victory; while the world's reactionaries, headed by US imperialism, are panic-stricken because of this new defeat.

The brilliant victory achieved in this new offensive once again proves that the United States' plan to invade Korea has completely failed, and the US aggressor troops can no longer recover on the Korean battlefield. After suffering a disastrous defeat in the so-called "general offensive" under the personal command of MacArthur, the US aggressor troops concentrated a large force and prepared for defense for a whole month, dreaming of stubbornly resisting in the Seoul area and southern Korea. However, under the powerful offensive of the brave and skilled Chinese and Korean People's Forces, the defense line, which the US aggressors boasted was "impregnable," quickly collapsed across the board. The US aggressors' "defense plan," like its offensive plan, has been shamefully bankrupt. Whether in offensive or defensive battles, the US aggressor troops cannot defeat the Chinese and Korean People's Armies, which powerfully shows that any attempt by the US aggressors to engage in military struggles at this time can only be a hopeless adventure.

Contradictions within the Imperialist Camp Continue to Deepen

With the continued victories of the Chinese and Korean people on the Korean battlefield, the disintegration within the imperialist camp is constantly deepening.

The contradictions within the US ruling clique have developed into a major division in the line of aggression since Hoover's speech. On the one hand, the Truman-Acheson clique is doing its best to defend its failures, repeatedly attacking Hoover's suggestions for an aggressive policy as "isolationism," which "contains the seeds of collapse in itself." On the other hand, Hoover's supporters attacked Truman's current aggressive policy for bringing serious disasters. Following Hoover, Taft, another leader of the Republican Party, delivered a challenging speech to the Truman administration in the Senate on January 5, sharply criticizing the Truman administration for pursuing "a policy that has discredited the United States in the eyes of the world." He put forward an aggressive plan similar to Hoover's. Republican Senators Watkins and Wiley also supported Hoover and demanded the replacement of Secretary of State Acheson.

The fierce debate surrounding the Truman-Acheson line of aggression and the Hoover-Taft line of aggression has now plunged the entire US ruling clique into a serious split. This split exists not only between the ruling Democratic Party and the so-called "opposition" Republican Party, but also between the Truman-Acheson group and the so-called Southern Democratic group within the Democratic Party, and between the Dewey-Dulles group and the Hoover-Taft group within the Republican Party. They attack each other's aggressive lines for causing devastating consequences to US imperialism, but none can prove that their aggressive lines will not produce the same result. These debates show a truth: whether continuing to implement the Truman-Acheson line or changing to the Hoover-Taft line, US imperialism cannot find a way out, and only faces the prospects of failure and death. This so-called "historical debate" within the US ruling clique is now being further unfolded in the 82nd Congress, which opened on January 3 in "the most unprecedentedly bleak light for the United States."

While the division within the US ruling clique is deepening and the bankruptcy of the US aggressive line is increasingly exposed, the division between the United States and its vassal states is also continuing to expand. The ruling groups of the United States' vassal states, especially Britain and France, are afraid that the United States' adventurous policies will bring them the disaster of rapid death, so their complaints and doubts about the United States are growing; and the discussions demanding to get rid of the United States' adventurous policy are also increasing. After the emergence of the so-called "neutralist movement" among some French bourgeoisie, an opinion demanding to take a so-called "independent line" is also growing within the British ruling group. The British Labour Party's "New Statesman and Nation" weekly has openly declared: "What we need now is for Britain to issue an independent statement on its views on solving world problems." The Liberal Party's Manchester Guardian also fearfully demanded: "Let us pursue British policies in diplomacy and in the United Nations." In fact, the differences between Britain and France and the United States are growing, and the United States' manipulation of the United Nations cannot be as completely satisfactory as it used to be. Recently, many American newspapers have been increasingly fiercely criticizing the "United Nations," saying that those countries that have always followed the United States' lead are now "hesitant," "cowardly," "betraying," and so on. This situation has made Truman unable to help but express "frank and undisguised annoyance." Lippmann, the spokesperson of the US capital group, said even more dejectedly: "The countries of Europe and Asia do not trust our leadership... All this leads to the same result—the breakdown of our alliance and the isolation of North America."

Faced with this increasingly obvious centrifugal tendency of its vassal states, the US government dispatched Eisenhower, the so-called "supreme commander" of the unified aggression forces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, to Western Europe on January 6, attempting to increase pressure on the vassal states in order to piece together a unified aggression force that is still only on paper. But Eisenhower's initial journey has proved that piecing together a unified aggression force is not smooth. The people of Western Europe are fiercely opposed to Eisenhower's activities that damage their national independence. The ruling classes of some Western European countries, due to the pressure of their own people, do not show enthusiasm for their defeated master. Even Shackford, a reporter for the United Press, could not help but admit: What Eisenhower obtained from the highest French officials after arriving in France were only some "most optimistic promises, but lurking behind the promises was France's great suspicion of US policy—extreme unwillingness to make the necessary sacrifices to build a truly effective French army."

It can be asserted that the contradictions within the imperialist camp will continue to develop with the increase in the blows given to imperialism by the people of the world, especially the Chinese and Korean people.

The Great Development of the World Peace Movement

Since the closing of the Second World Peace Congress, the world peace movement has made further progress. The magnificence of the movement's scale and its obvious anti-aggression nature show that the important resolutions of the Peace Congress and the glorious victory of the Chinese people's resistance against the US and aid to Korea have greatly inspired the people of the world and brought more people into the practical struggle against aggression and in defense of peace.

The Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression passed a resolution on November 25 last year to support the Great Appeal and Resolutions; the Chinese Central People's Government Committee passed a resolution on the ten proposals of the Peace Congress on December 26 last year; the Chinese people are continuing to launch the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea. In the people's democratic countries of Europe, the German Democratic Republic and countries such as the Czech Republic, Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria have successively passed laws to defend peace in accordance with the Great Appeal Resolution; all countries have decided to make all propaganda tools serve the defense of peace and educate the people in the spirit of international friendship and cooperation. At the end of 1950, the people's democratic countries of Europe all completed or exceeded their economic construction plans ahead of schedule, and are now implementing larger-scale economic construction plans. The growth of the national strength of socialist countries and people's democratic countries has become a powerful guarantee for the inevitable victory of peace.

In capitalist countries, the struggle of the broad masses of people against aggressive wars has increasingly developed into a broad mass movement. American peace fighters have powerfully put forward the fighting slogans of "Do not fight China" and "War mongers must be forced to accept peace." Now, 110 local committees of peace committees have been established in various cities in the United States. The peace assembly held in New York last December passed a resolution calling for universal disarmament and inviting the People's Republic of China to join the United Nations. Representatives of many progressive trade unions jointly requested the convening of a conference of the five major powers: China, the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France. American youth leaders established the Youth Peace Congress in Chicago on January 8, expressing their firm opposition to American militarization and compulsory military service. Many American youths have openly refused to enlist. The American Women's Peace Defense Organization once led 2,000 women in a demonstration at the United Nations headquarters, demanding an end to the war of aggression against Korea. An increasing number of American mothers are demanding that the Truman administration withdraw American soldiers from Korea.

The peace movement in the United Kingdom has also made significant progress, with many mass peace rallies raising demands not to participate in the war of aggression against China. The Italian Peace Committee has widely organized discussions on reducing military budgets. The Hague Peace Committee in the Netherlands opposes the use of the ports of Rotterdam and Amsterdam by the US military. The Canadian Peace Committee is demanding the abolition of US bases in Canada. Youths in Chile and Costa Rica have put forward the slogan of not sending a single soldier for the US invasion of Korea. Japanese women's gatherings demanded a ban on sending Japanese troops to fight in Korea, and many workers and students held peace votes to "ban atomic bombs." These actions are striking at the US imperialist aggression plan in all aspects.

Currently, the working people of Western Europe are launching large-scale protests against arming West Germany and establishing a unified aggression force. Thousands of people in London held demonstrations protesting against arming West Germany. The German people are taking various ways to oppose the reconstruction of the Nazi army. The people of France and Italy held strikes, rallies, and demonstrations to protest against the arrival of Eisenhower, the commander of the European aggressive forces, in Europe. The broad masses of the European people are defending the peace of Europe with staunch struggles.

The great struggle of the people of the world against aggression and in defense of peace has deepened the difficulties of war instigators and frustrated their aggressive plans. The continued development of this struggle greatly increases the possibility of preventing US imperialism from launching a third world war.

    中、朝人民部队继续胜利南进
    朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军于去年除夕发动的新攻势，正在胜利发展中。在一月四日朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的首都汉城重获解放以后，中朝人民部队又连续地解放了仁川、水原、原州、骊州、龙仁、利川等重要城市。据初步的统计，截至一月七日止，中朝人民部队已在这次新攻势中，歼灭了美国侵略军和李承晚匪军一万余人，前进了三百余里。目前，朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军正在继续胜利南进，为解放朝鲜全国而战；而溃不成军的美国侵略军和李承晚匪军正在慌乱地向南溃逃。
    全朝鲜、全中国和全世界的人民，都为这次新胜利而欢呼；而以美帝国主义为首的世界反动派，都因这次新的失败而惊慌失色。
    这次新攻势所获得的光辉胜利，再次证明美国侵略朝鲜的计划已经彻底失败了，美国侵略军在朝鲜战场上已无法翻身了。美国侵略军在麦克阿瑟亲自指挥下的所谓“总攻势”遭受惨败以后，曾集中了很大兵力，进行了一个整月的防守准备，梦想在汉城地区和南部朝鲜负隅顽抗。但是在英勇善战的中朝人民部队的强大攻势下，曾为美国侵略者吹嘘“固若金汤”的防线，迅速地全线崩溃了。美国侵略者的“防御计划”，像它的进攻计划一样，已可耻地破产了。不论在进攻战中，或在防御战中，美国侵略军都打不过中朝人民军队，这有力地说明：目前美国侵略者从事任何军事挣扎的企图，都只能是毫无希望的冒险。
    帝国主义阵营内部矛盾继续加深
    随着中朝人民在朝鲜战场上的继续胜利，帝国主义阵营内部的分崩离析正在不断加深。
    美国统治集团内部的矛盾，自胡佛演说后，已发展成为侵略路线的重大分歧。一方面，杜鲁门、艾奇逊集团竭力为他们的失败辩护，一再攻击胡佛的侵略政策建议为“孤立主义”，“其本身包含着崩溃的种子”。另一方面，胡佛的支持者则攻击杜鲁门的现行侵略政策招来了严重的灾难。继胡佛之后，共和党另一首脑塔夫脱又于一月五日在参议院发表了对杜鲁门政府挑战性的演说，尖锐地抨击杜鲁门政府奉行了“使美国在世人眼中威信扫地的政策”。他提出了与胡佛相类似的侵略计划。共和党参议员瓦金斯和惠利等也支持胡佛，要求撤换国务卿艾奇逊。
    围绕着杜鲁门——艾奇逊侵略路线与胡佛——塔夫脱侵略路线的激烈争吵，使整个美国统治集团现在已陷于严重的分裂中。这种分裂不仅存在于当政的民主党与所谓“在野”的共和党之间，而且也存在于民主党内的杜鲁门——艾奇逊集团与所谓南方民主党集团之间，存在于共和党内的杜威——杜勒斯集团与胡佛——塔夫脱集团之间。他们彼此攻击对方的侵略路线会给美帝国主义招致毁灭性的后果，但都无法证明自己的侵略路线不会产生同样的结果。这些争论表明了一个真理，不论继续实行杜鲁门——艾奇逊的路线，或者改行胡佛——塔夫脱路线，美帝国主义同样找不到出路，同样只有失败、只有死亡的前途。目前美国统治集团内部的这种所谓“历史大辩论”，正在一月三日于“美国空前未有的暗淡光景”下开幕的八十二届国会中进一步展开。
    与美国统治集团分裂日益加深、美国的侵略路线的破产日益暴露同时，美国与其仆从国家之间的分裂也在继续扩大。美国的仆从国家，特别是英法两国的统治集团，害怕美国冒险政策将给他们带来迅速死亡的灾难，因此对美国的埋怨和疑虑日益增长；而开始要求摆脱美国冒险政策支配的议论，也日益增多。在一部分法国资产阶级中出现了所谓“中立主义的运动”以后，在英国统治集团内部也在滋长着一种要求采取所谓“独立路线”的舆论。英国工党的“新政治家与民族”周刊已公然声称：“我们眼前所需要的，是英国就其解决世界问题的意见发表一项独立声明。”自由党的曼彻斯特卫报也惶恐地要求：“让我们在外交方面与联合国内奉行英国的政策吧。”事实上英法与美国间的分歧越来越大，美国操纵联合国已不能像过去那样完全称心如意了。最近许多美国报纸已越来越激烈地叱责“联合国”，说那些一向唯美国马首是瞻的国家现在“犹疑”、“怯懦”、“背弃”等等。这种情况使杜鲁门也不能不表示“直言无隐的烦恼”。美国资本集团的代言人李普曼更沮丧地说：“欧洲的与亚洲的国家都不信赖我们的领导……这一切引导到同一的结果——我们联盟的破裂和北美的孤立。”
    面对着仆从国家这种日益明显的离心倾向，美国政府已于一月六日派遣北大西洋公约统一侵略军的所谓“最高司令”艾森豪威尔前往西欧，企图对各仆从国加强压力，以拚凑成一支至今仍然是在纸上的统一侵略军。但是艾森豪威尔最初的旅程已经证明，拚凑统一侵略军并不顺利。西欧各国人民激烈反对艾森豪威尔损害本国的独立活动。西欧若干国家的统治阶级，由于受到本国人民的压力，对它们战败了的主子并不表示热心。这连合众社记者沙可福都不能不承认：艾森豪威尔到法国后从法国最高官员那里获得的，只是一些“最乐观的诺言，但潜伏在诺言的背后的，则是法国十分怀疑美国政策——极不愿意为了建立真正有效的法国军队而作出必要的牺牲”。
    可以断言，帝国主义阵营内部的矛盾，随着全世界人民、特别是中朝人民给予帝国主义打击的增加，将继续发展。
    世界和平运动的巨大发展
    第二届世界保卫和平大会闭幕以来，全世界和平运动有了更进一步的发展。运动规模的壮阔及其明显的反侵略的性质，显示了和平大会的重大决议和中国人民抗美援朝的辉煌胜利，已大大振奋了全世界人民，使更多的人们涌入反对侵略保卫和平的实际斗争中来了。
    中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会于去年十一月二十五日通过决议，拥护和大宣言及决议；中国中央人民政府委员会又于去年十二月二十六日通过了关于和平大会的十项建议的决议；中国人民正继续展开抗美援朝运动。在欧洲的人民民主国家，德意志民主共和国和捷克、罗马尼亚、匈牙利、保加利亚等国，已先后根据和大决议，通过了保卫和平法案；各国都决定使一切宣传工具为保卫和平服务，并以国际友好合作的精神教育人民。在一九五○年年终，欧洲各人民民主国家都提前或超额完成了经济建设计划，现在正执行更大规模的经济建设计划。社会主义国家和人民民主国家国力的增长，已成为和平必胜的有力保障。
    在资本主义国家里，广大人民反对侵略战争的斗争，已日益发展成为广泛的群众性运动。美国和平斗士已有力地提出了“不与中国作战”和“必须强迫战争贩子接受和平”的战斗口号。现在美国各城市已成立了一百一十个和平委员会的地方委员会。去年十二月纽约举行的和平集会通过了要求普遍裁军和邀请中华人民共和国参加联合国的决议。许多进步工会的代表联名要求召开中苏美英法五大国会议。美国青年领袖于一月八日在芝加哥成立了青年保卫和平大会，表示坚决反对美国军国主义化和强迫兵役。许多美国青年已公开拒绝入伍。美国妇女保卫和平组织曾领导两千名妇女在联合国会址举行示威，要求停止侵略朝鲜的战争。日益众多的美国母亲们正在要求杜鲁门政府把美国士兵撤出朝鲜。
    英国的和平运动也有了显著发展，许多群众性的和平集会都提出了不参加侵略中国战争的要求。意大利和平委员会已经广泛组织了缩减军事预算的讨论。荷兰海牙和平委员会反对美军利用鹿特丹和阿姆斯特丹港口。加拿大和平委员会要求取消美国在加拿大的基地。智利和哥斯达黎加的青年提出不为美国侵略朝鲜派遣一个士兵的口号。日本妇女集会要求禁止派遣日本军队赴朝作战，许多工人和学生举行了“禁止原子弹”的和平投票。这些行动在各个方面打击着美帝国主义的侵略计划。
    目前，西欧的劳动人民正在展开大规模的抗议运动，反对武装西德和建立统一侵略军。伦敦曾有数千人举行抗议武装西德的示威。德国人民采取各种方式反对重建纳粹军。法国、意大利人民举行罢工、集会、示威游行，抗议欧洲侵略军司令艾森豪威尔到达欧洲。欧洲广大人民群众正以坚强的斗争保卫欧洲的和平。
    全世界人民的反对侵略、保卫和平的伟大斗争，已经加深了战争挑拨者的困难，挫败着它们的侵略计划。这一斗争的继续发展使制止美帝国主义发动第三次世界大战的可能性大大增加。
