Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 6th: The newspaper *Izvestia's* international commentator, Kudryavtsev, published an article on the 3rd, commenting on a recent foreign policy statement made by US State Department advisor Dulles.

Kudryavtsev wrote: Although Dulles did not mention Hoover's recent broadcast, which sharply criticized the policies of Truman and Acheson, Dulles' statement is considered a response from the State Department to Hoover. The debate between Dulles and Hoover, conducted in a disguised form, is no accident. Facts prove that the "overall diplomacy" pursued by the US ruling circles has failed. These facts are so obvious that Dulles had no choice but to honestly admit that American foreign policy has suffered a crisis.

When talking about American foreign policy, Dulles had to reluctantly admit that not everything is perfect in this regard, and that the United States made mistakes in carrying out its leadership tasks. Dulles also could not avoid acknowledging the undeniable fact that neither the Marshall Plan nor the North Atlantic aggressive alliance produced the results that American imperialism had expected. Furthermore, these two events did not eliminate the contradictions within the imperialist camp. Dulles lamented the fact that the imperialist camp is in a mess, and that no agreement has been reached on the "prevention program." Due to the failure of the US adventure in Korea, Dulles was forced to say that the US ruling circles now instinctively feel that there is something wrong with this method and do not want to be drawn into many "Korean incidents" around the world.

Dulles shamelessly advocated the aggressive strategic theory of American imperialism, according to which the US armed forces can launch aggression anywhere the United States deems it advantageous. Dulles preemptively defended any aggressive steps taken by American imperialism, no matter when, where, or against whom such steps are taken. In this way, Dulles is arguing with Hoover, who does not believe that American rule can be established in Europe and Asia and believes that the rule of American imperialists must be ensured in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans.

Those who advocate the diplomatic policies of Truman, Acheson, and Harriman, in order to make their arguments more powerful, accuse Hoover of promoting isolationist policies. In fact, these accusations are absolutely unfounded. Isn't Hoover urging the establishment of real American borders far beyond the borders of the United States of America? Isn't he asking the United States to "withdraw" from Korea and Western Europe, thereby frightening the allies of American imperialism and promoting American aggression preparations? Perhaps this can also be considered "isolationism"! Therefore, whether it is Hoover or Dulles, they still adhere to their consistent stance of aggression and war.

Dulles' statement cannot refute the fact that American foreign policy is in a deep crisis and that differences have emerged within the American ruling circles as a result. This division exists not only between the Republican and Democratic parties, but also within the two parties. The attack by Republican Dulles on Republican Hoover is evidence of this. Dulles' speech once again shows that the American ruling circles disregard the lessons of life and are determined to continue to lead the country down the harmful path of the bankrupt "overall diplomacy."

### 美统治集团内部发生分歧  消息报评杜勒斯外交政策演说

　　美统治集团内部发生分歧
    消息报评杜勒斯外交政策演说
    【新华社六日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：《消息报》国际评论员库德里雅夫采夫三日在该报撰文，评论美国国务院顾问杜勒斯最近所发表的外交政策声明。
    库德里雅夫采夫写道：虽然杜勒斯对胡佛不久前发表的激烈指责杜鲁门、艾奇逊政策的广播演说只字未提，但杜勒斯的声明却被认为是国务院对胡佛的一种答复。杜勒斯和胡佛二人之间的论战，是在伪装的形式下进行的，这不是偶然的。种种事实证明，美国现在统治集团所奉行的“总体外交”已经失败，这些事实是如此地明显，以致于杜勒斯别无可择，只好老实承认美国外交政策已经遭受危机。
    杜勒斯在谈到美国外交政策时，不得不情不自愿地承认在这方面并不是一切都十全十美的，美国在执行其领导任务时，犯了错误。杜勒斯也逃免不了承认这种无可争辩的事实，即：不论马歇尔计划还是北大西洋侵略联盟，都没有产生美帝国主义所预期的成果，而且首先这两件事并没有消除帝国主义阵营内部的矛盾。杜勒斯慨叹这样一件事实，即：帝国主义阵营中已闹得一团糟，对于“防阻计划”，也没有获致协议。由于美国在朝鲜冒险的失败，杜勒斯迫不得已地说：美国统治集团现在本能地感觉到这种方法的某种错误，并且不希望在全世界被牵入许多个“朝鲜事件”中。
    杜勒斯恬不知耻地鼓吹美帝国主义的侵略的战略理论，根据这种理论，美国的武装部队可以在美国认为有利的任何地方发动侵略。杜勒斯预先为美帝国主义的任何侵略步骤进行辩护，不论这种步骤是在何时何地为了对付谁而采取的。这样，杜勒斯就和那位不相信能够在欧洲和亚洲建立美国统治而且认为必须在太平洋和大西洋确保美帝国主义者的统治的胡佛争论起来了。
    鼓吹杜鲁门、艾奇逊和哈里曼的外交政策路线的人，为了使得他们的论据更有力量，便责难胡佛在宣传孤立主义的政策。事实上，这些责难是绝对没有根据的。胡佛不正在敦促远在美利坚合众国的边界之外建立真正的美国疆界吗？他不是要求美国“撤出”朝鲜和西欧，借此来恐吓美帝国主义的盟友，并促进美国的侵略准备吗？也许这也算是“孤立主义”吧！因此，无论是胡佛或者杜勒斯，都仍然坚持他们一贯的侵略和战争的立场。
    杜勒斯的声明不能驳倒这样的事实，就是说，美国的外交政策已处在深刻的危机中，美国统治集团内部已经因此而发生分歧了。这种分歧不仅存在于共和党和民主党之间，而且也存在于两党的内部，共和党人杜勒斯对共和党人胡佛的攻击即为明证。杜勒斯的演说再度表示，美国统治集团漠视生活的教训，决定继续把国家引向已经破产的“总体外交”的有害的道路。
