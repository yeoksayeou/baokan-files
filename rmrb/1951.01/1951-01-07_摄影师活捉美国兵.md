Photographer Captures American Soldier
    Zhong Xin

On the western front of the Korean battlefield, the Chinese and Korean People's Forces launched a fierce counterattack against the invading American forces on November 25th, achieving a great victory that reversed the situation. The main force of the enemy, badly battered, was completely surrounded and annihilated by the Chinese and Korean People's Forces in the mountainous area southwest of Jiachuan and Junyuli.

The battle ended on December 2nd, leaving American invaders’ corpses strewn across the fields. The weapons and ammunition they abandoned while fleeing in panic piled up in every ditch and valley. The victorious people's soldiers were busy clearing the battlefield.

Liu Deyuan, a photographer from the Beijing Film Studio, and his two assistants, Su Zhongyi and Sun Shuxiang, were preparing to move after filming many moving scenes of the campaign. The volunteer comrades repeatedly urged them to be careful along the way, because the battle had just ended, and scattered enemy troops might still be hiding in the surrounding mountains. The comrades in the army always took extra care of these cultural workers who fought on the front lines not with guns, but with cameras. However, the newsreel photographers of the people's film industry have been growing and strengthening in the midst of war, and they are no strangers to war. Liu Deyuan followed the army throughout the Chinese People's Liberation War, from Northeast China all the way to Hainan Island. He had only returned from the front line this summer, and this time he was among the first to volunteer to work on the Korean front. His two assistants had also participated in many campaigns on the domestic battlefield, and Su Zhongyi was a gun enthusiast. Therefore, in addition to their equipment, they also carried two carbines and a Canadian pistol. One carbine was a war trophy given to them by the volunteers, the other was found in the battlefield, and the Canadian pistol was seized by Liu Deyuan from the enemy during the Liberation War.

They had traveled about five or six li when suddenly an American reconnaissance plane circled overhead, flying lower and lower as if it had spotted something. They quickly hid in a nearby ditch.

Liu Deyuan and Sun Shuxiang were in an east-west ditch, and Su Zhongyi was in a north-south ditch. After a while, the plane left. They prepared to eat some dry rations in the ditch before continuing on.

At this moment, three straggling American soldiers suddenly appeared, walking north to south along the small ditch where Su Zhongyi was resting, looking furtive and withdrawn. The one in the middle appeared to be an officer, carrying a carbine. The other two each carried an American automatic rifle. They were all wearing only thin, dark green uniforms, hunching their necks, and constantly breathing on their hands to warm them. They approached Su Zhongyi to within about thirty or forty meters before Su Zhongyi heard a murmuring sound. He looked up and saw that three American devils had already reached him. Calmly, he raised his gun and fired two shots at them. The three fellows were unexpectedly startled, and turned around and ran in terror. Liu Deyuan and Sun Shuxiang, in the other ditch, heard the gunfire and looked up to see three American soldiers trying to escape. Liu Deyuan jumped out of the ditch, drew his gun, and chased after them, shouting, "Catch them, don't let them get away!" When he had chased about twenty meters, the three fellows suddenly lay down and opened fire on him and his two assistants. Liu Deyuan alertly returned four shots, but he only had one bullet left and dared not fire again; moreover, the ground where he was lying was very flat, which was very disadvantageous. At this time, the enemy was firing wildly at him, and the officer opened the carbine's rapid-fire, sweeping like a machine gun. Liu Deyuan was very anxious and also very angry. He turned around and shouted to Su Zhongyi and Sun Shuxiang: "Aim and fire! Suppress the enemy's fire!" However, only Su Zhongyi among the two assistants knew how to shoot a gun, and he also didn't have many bullets left. This young man, Su Zhongyi, really had some skill: Sun Shuxiang helped him load the bullets, and every bullet landed in front of the enemy. Liu Deyuan took the opportunity to get up, braved the bullets, ran back to the two assistants, picked up the other carbine, and fired fiercely at the enemy. The enemy's fire was completely suppressed and quickly ceased resistance. Liu Deyuan stood up and saw three enemies kneeling there in a disheveled manner, their weapons across their knees, their hands trembling and raised high. "The enemy has surrendered, come and capture the prisoners!" Liu Deyuan shouted as he ran towards the enemy. Unexpectedly, the enemy officer picked up the carbine from the ground again. This startled Liu Deyuan, thinking he had fallen for the enemy's trick; but the other two enemies remained kneeling there, motionless. What was going on?! Liu Deyuan was hesitating when the enemy officer threw the gun far away with force. Only then did he realize: the enemy was afraid that Liu Deyuan would have doubts about the "sincerity" of their surrender.

Liu Deyuan rushed a few steps to the trembling enemy. The enemy officer, inexplicably, pointed to his own chest, indicating that he still had a pistol in his pocket, and wanted Liu Deyuan to take it out. At this time, the two assistants also ran over and discovered that two of the three surrendering enemies had been wounded in the previous battle. So, they immediately took out the first aid kits they carried and bandaged them. This generous treatment moved the three captured enemies to tears. They said shamefully, "Thank you! Thank you!" Although they did not understand each other's language, they had already felt the leniency of our prisoner policy through their actions. When they knew that their lives could be saved, their tense emotions, caused by fear, gradually relaxed, and they gave a thumbs-up, praising Su Zhongyi, who had just shot the gun, saying, "Number one! Number one!" So, the photographers helped the wounded prisoners up, carried all the guns, and continued to move forward.

On the way, the captured officer took out a yellow handkerchief from his body and gestured to explain that it was a signal for contacting the plane. The enemy plane circling in the air earlier was there to contact them.

After the prisoners were sent to the headquarters, the volunteer comrades greatly praised the heroic actions of Liu Deyuan and the other comrades, and each of the three was given a "minor combat merit" award.

　　摄影师活捉美国兵
    钟辛
    朝鲜战场西线的中朝人民部队，从十一月二十五日开始向进攻的美侵略军猛烈反击，取得了扭转战局的伟大胜利，被打得落花流水的敌军主力一部，在价川、军隅里西南的山地里，被中朝人民部队全部包围歼灭了。
    十二月二日战斗结束，美侵略军遗尸遍野，他们在狼狈溃逃时丢下的武器弹药，堆得满坑满谷。胜利了的人民战士，正忙着清扫战场。
    北京电影制片厂摄影师刘德源和他的两个助手——苏中义和孙树相，在拍完了战役的许多动人场面后，准备转移。志愿军的同志们一再叮嘱，要他们沿途小心。因为战斗刚刚结束，周围的山地里可能还躲藏着溃散的敌军。对于这些不是用枪杆而是用摄影机在火线上战斗的文化工作者，部队的同志总是关照得特别周到一些。不过，人民电影的新闻摄影工作者，一直便是在战争中成长壮大起来的，他们对于战争并不陌生。刘德源就是随军队在中国人民解放战争中，从东北一直打到海南岛去的一个。今年夏天他才从前线归来。这次他又是第一批志愿参加朝鲜前线工作的。他的两个助手也是在国内战场上参加过好多次战役的，而苏中义则是一个枪的爱好者。因此他们除了带着自己的机器外，还带着两支卡宾枪和一支加拿大手枪。一支卡宾枪是志愿军送给他们的战利品，另一支卡宾枪是他们在战地里搜索到的，加拿大手枪则是刘德源在解放战争中从敌人手里缴获的。
    他们走了约摸五六里地的光景，忽然一架美国侦察机在头顶上盘旋，而且愈飞愈低，仿佛发现了什么目标似的。他们赶快隐伏在附近的小沟里。
    刘德源和孙树相在一条东西的沟里，苏中义在另外一条南北的沟里，一会儿飞机走了。他们在沟里准备吃一些干粮，再继续前进。
    这时候，突然出现了三个美军散兵，缩头缩脑地沿着苏中义休息的那条小沟由北向南走来。中间的一个好像是军官，手里提着一支卡宾枪；另外两个各拿着美式自动步枪。他们都只穿着单薄的墨绿色军服，缩着脖子，把手放在嘴边，不断哈热气取暖。他们走近苏中义约有三、四十米远的地方，苏中义才听到有唧唧咕咕的说话声，抬头一看，三个美国鬼子已经走到了自己跟前。他很沉着地端起枪来，照着他们“呯，呯”两枪。这三个家伙意外地吓了一跳，失魂落魄地转身就跑。在另外一条沟里的刘德源和孙树相听见枪响，抬头一看，三个美国兵正要逃跑。刘德源从沟里跳出来，拔枪就追，同时高喊：“捉住他们，别叫跑掉了！”当他追出二十米远的时候，那三个家伙突然卧倒，向他和另外两个助手开枪射击。刘德源警敏地还击了四枪，他只剩下一发子弹了，不敢再打了；而他卧倒的地方，地势又很平旷，非常不利。这时，敌人疯狂地向他射击，那个军官开动了卡宾枪的快机，像机枪一样扫射过来。刘德源非常着急，也非常愤怒，回头向苏中义和孙树相喊道：“瞄准了打！压住敌人的火力！”可是，两个助手中只有苏中义会打枪，而且子弹也不多了。苏中义这小伙子还真有两套：孙树相帮助他压子弹，每颗子弹全打在敌人面前。刘德源便趁机爬起来，冒着弹雨跑回两个助手那里，拿起另外那支卡宾枪，向敌人猛烈射击。敌人的火力完全被压下去了，并且很快停止了抵抗。刘德源站起来一看：三个敌人狼狈地跪在那里，武器横在膝前，双手抖抖缩缩地向上齐举。“敌人缴枪啦，快来捉俘虏啊！”刘德源一面喊着，一面向敌人跑过去。冷不防，敌军军官又从地上把卡宾枪拾起来。这倒把刘德源吓了一跳，以为中了敌人的诡计；但另外的两个敌人却依旧木然不动地跪在那里。这究竟是怎么回事呢？！刘德源正在迟疑，那个敌军军官把枪用力往远处一扔。这才明白：原来敌人是怕刘德源对他们投降的“诚意”有怀疑。
    刘德源几步就窜到吓得发抖的敌人面前，那个敌军军官又莫明其妙地用手指着自己的心窝，原来在他的怀里还放着一支手枪，要刘德源取出来。这时候，两个助手也跑了过来，并发现三个投降的敌军中有两个已经在刚才的战斗中被打伤了。于是，他们马上拿出自己随身所带的救济包替他们包扎，宽大的待遇，使三个被俘的敌人感动得流下泪来。他们惭愧地说：“谢谢！谢谢！”双方言语虽然不通，但由行动中他们已感到我们俘虏政策的宽大。当他们知道自己的性命可以保住的时候，因恐惧而紧张的情绪渐渐松下来，竖起大拇指称赞刚刚打枪的苏中义说：“数第一！数第一！”于是，摄影师们扶起受伤的俘虏，背着全部的枪支，继续前进。
    在路上，那个被俘的军官从身上摸出一块黄色的手巾，打着手势说明那是与飞机连络用的信号。刚才在上空盘旋的敌机便是与他们来连络的。
    在俘虏被送到指挥部以后，志愿军的同志对刘德源等同志的英勇行为十分赞扬，并且给他们三人都记了一次“战斗小功”。
