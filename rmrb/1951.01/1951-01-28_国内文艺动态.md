Domestic Literary and Art Developments

A significant achievement has been the publication of several relatively complete Chinese translations of foreign classical literary works from 1949 to 1950, thanks to the diligent efforts of translators.

Balzac, the great 19th-century French realist writer, had some of his magnum opus "The Human Comedy" previously translated into Chinese. Now, Gao Mingkai has translated the entire "Scenes from Provincial Life," including "The Curé of Tours," "Pierrette," "A Bachelor's Establishment," "The Two Poets," "Eugénie Grandet," "A Distinguished Provincial at Paris," "The Secrets of a Princess," "Lost Illusions," "The Lily of the Valley," "The Old Maid," "The Collection of Antiquities," and "Pierrette," totaling twelve volumes. Published by Haiyan Bookstore.

The Pingming Publishing House is undertaking a large-scale translation and publication project of literary works. The "New Translation Series," edited by Ba Jin, has already published Gorky's five memoirs: "Days with Lenin," "Reminiscences of Andreyev," "Reminiscences of Korolenko," "Reminiscences of Chekhov," and "Reminiscences of Tolstoy."

Last year, the "Chekhov Short Stories" in this series published six volumes: "The Witch and Other Stories," "The Steppe and Other Stories," "Misery and Other Stories," "The Party and Other Stories," "The Dependent and Other Stories," and "Lights and Shadows: Short Stories." The entire collection will consist of twenty-five volumes, translated by Ru Long, re-translated from Constance Garnett's English translation.

The "Tolstoy Plays" in the same series has released five volumes: "The First Distiller," "The Power of Darkness," "The Fruits of Enlightenment," "The Living Corpse," and "The Light Shines in Darkness." Except for "The Power of Darkness," which was re-translated by Wen Ying from Louise and Aylmer Maude's English translation, the rest were translated by Li Jianwu, the versions on which these were based are not specified.

In addition to the aforementioned "Tolstoy Plays," Li Jianwu has also translated "Molière's Plays" and "Gorky's Plays." The former is published by Kaiming Bookstore and has released eight volumes: "The Bourgeois Gentleman," "The Doctor in Spite of Himself," "Monsieur de Pourceaugnac," "The Affected Young Ladies," "George Dandin," "Don Juan," and "The Miser," all translated from the original French. "Gorky's Plays" is published by Shanghai Publishing Company and has released six volumes: "The Lower Depths," "Enemies," "The Eccentrics," "Vassa Zheleznova," "The Zykovs," and "Yegor Bulychov and Others." "The Lower Depths," "Enemies," and "Yegor Bulychov and Others" were translated from English editions published by the Moscow Foreign Languages Publishing House, while the other three were translated from English editions published by Yale University Press.

Ilya Ehrenburg's "The Storm" has been translated into Chinese by Gao Qingyue and Dan Wen. Ehrenburg recently wrote a letter to the translators to express his gratitude and wrote a preface for the Chinese edition, which is translated as follows: "I am honored to have my novel published in Chinese. I deeply know that after the great historical storms, the Chinese people know the value of victory. I am convinced that Chinese readers understand the thoughts and feelings of the Soviet people fighting for the freedom of their motherland and the freedom of the people all over the world. I take this opportunity of the publication of my book to express my respect for the epic and great Chinese revolution. It shows friends and enemies alike that the Chinese people not only know their own strength, but also know the strength of their truth."

Following the closing of the Northwest Literary and Art Workers Congress on September 30th of last year, the Northwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee issued "Instructions on Several Issues Concerning Current Literary and Art Work" on November 16th, first affirming that the report "Unite and Strive to Build the Northwest and Develop Literary and Art Movements of All Nationalities" passed by the Northwest Literary and Art Congress is the current guiding principle of the Party in the Northwest region's literary and art movement. Based on the reflections of delegates from various regions attending the congress, the Northwest Bureau also pointed out that the main deviations of the Party committees in various regions in leading literary and art work are insufficient understanding of the important significance of literary and art work and the important principle that the Party must lead literary and art work. Some provinces even handed over the Federation of Literary and Art Circles to the Department of Culture and Education for leadership, and the Department of Culture and Education then pushed it to the Social Education Section; during this period, the Party's leadership of literary and art work in the Northwest still followed the old methods: focusing on the administrative and trivial management of affairs, while neglecting the important significance of ideological leadership, thereby reducing the active role of the Party in leading literary and art work. The Northwest Bureau called on Party committees at all levels to include literary and art work in the Party's work agenda in the future. It also specifically stipulated the tasks of the Party's propaganda departments in leading literary and art work: First, to check the extent to which Party members in literary and art organizations have implemented the Party committee's decisions on the direction, tasks, etc. of literary and art work; Second, to regularly summarize literary and art work and submit opinions to the Party committee on improving literary and art work; Third, to regularly hold symposiums with literary and art cadres to study and discuss issues related to literary and art activities or creative ideas based on the requirements of the Party's overall political tasks.

Finally, regarding the issue of training literary and art cadres, the Northwest Bureau pointed out that the responsible departments of the Party should specifically guide them in their studies, help them become familiar with the Party's various policies, enable them to understand the Party's central work guidelines and tasks in each period, and encourage and care for their creations so that they can regularly connect with reality. Benevolent criticism and education should be given to the shortcomings of literary and art workers; the view that the Party's literary and art workers can be sloppy and not act in accordance with the Party's principles is wrong and harmful to the cultivation and progress of literary and art cadres.

The Cultural Department of the East China Military and Political Committee has summarized the anti-US and aid-Korea drama creations of 1950, awarding 10 million yuan in bonuses to "Lord Xinling" (Yue Opera, performed by the Yulan Troupe), "The Last Days of the Demons" (Pingtan), "The Three Heroes Punish the US" (Pingtan), and "Water Margin" (Peking Opera, including stage performance). The East China Cultural Department's Drama Reform Office will now allocate 10 million yuan in bonuses monthly to reward outstanding new drama performances in East China. The Shanghai Municipal Drama Reform Office has decided to issue bonuses once a year to reward troupes that have achieved outstanding results in a year.

The Hebei Provincial Literary and Art Evaluation Committee announced on November 24th of last year the winning works from the establishment of the provincial government to June 1950, including the plays "Not Cicadas" and "The Daughter's Marriage," the novels "New Things Done in a New Way" and "Widow Liu's Marriage," the Peking Opera "Hua Mulan," and 84 items including drum lyrics, New Year pictures, and woodcuts.

The Cultural and Educational Department of the Pingyuan Provincial People's Government and the Pingyuan Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles jointly announced the first batch of award-winning works for the 1950 literary and artistic creation awards on January 21st, including six first-class works such as "Peanuts" (novel) and "We Want Him to Pile Up Grain Like Mountains" (poem), seven second-class works such as "Do a Good Job in Production" (poem), and twenty-seven third-class works such as "Double Happiness Arrives at the Door" (lyrics).

In order to guide the development of literary and art work in various departments, all major military regions of the People's Liberation Army publish their own literary and art publications in addition to various entertainment materials and literary and art collections. For example, the Second Field Army's "Literary and Art Work," which focuses on publishing creative research and literary and art works, has now published 19 issues; the Fourth Field Army's "Literary and Art Warrior," which studies business, supplies singing materials, and introduces the dynamics of various departments, has now released its fifth issue; the Third Field Army's concise and refined "Literary and Art Series" has been expanded this year into a sixteen-format book published by Xinhua Suijun Bookstore. In addition, the North China and Northeast Military Regions' "Literary and Art Work Newsletter" and "Troop Literature and Art," and the First Field Army's "Troop Literature and Art Series" have all played a certain role in developing the troop's literary and art movement. Since the resolution of the All-Army Propaganda, Education and Culture Work Conference at the end of last year, the General Political Department of the Military Commission has begun planning to publish an all-army comprehensive large-scale literary and art monthly "Liberation Army Literature and Art," and the inaugural issue will be published at the end of March.

　　国内文艺动态
    外国古典文学著作的比较完善的中译本，从一九四九年到一九五○年止，经翻译家辛勤的努力，已经出版了不少种。这是一个重要的成绩。
    法国十九世纪现实主义大作家巴尔扎克的巨著《人间喜剧》过去曾有一部分中译本出版。现已由高名凯将其中《外省生活之场景》全部译出，包括《杜尔的教士》《毕爱丽黛》《单身汉的故事》《两诗人》《葛兰德·欧琴妮》《地区才女》《外省伟人在巴黎》《发明家的苦恼》《幽谷百合》《老小姐》《古物陈列室》《米露埃·雨儿胥》共十二册。海燕书店刊印。
    平明出版社正在进行一个规模较大的文学著作的翻译出版工作。由巴金主编的《新译文丛刊》，已经出版了高尔基的五个回忆集：《和列宁相处的日子》，《回忆安德列叶夫》，《回忆科洛连珂》，《回忆契诃夫》，《回忆托尔斯泰》。
    去年这一丛刊中的《契诃夫小说集》已出《巫婆集》《三年集》《苦恼集》《嫁妆集》《食客集》《亮光集》等六册。全书共二十五册，译者汝龙，系由康丝坦司·嘉奈德的英译重译。
    同一丛刊中的《托尔斯泰戏剧集》已出《头一个造酒的》《黑暗的势力》《文明的果实》《活尸》《光在黑暗里发亮》等五册。除《黑暗的势力》为文颖由露易斯和爱尔麦·莫德的英译重译外，余均为李健吾所译，所根据的版本不详。
    李健吾所翻译的外国戏剧除上述《托尔斯泰戏剧集》外，还有《莫里哀戏剧集》和《高尔基戏剧集》。前者由开明书店出版，已出《向贵人看齐》《屈打成医》《德甫叟雅克先生》《可笑的女才子》《乔治·党丹》《党·璜》《吝啬鬼》等八册，均由原文译出。《高尔基戏剧集》由上海出版公司出版，已出《底层》《仇敌》《怪人》《瓦莎谢列日娃诺》《日考夫一家人》《叶高尔布雷乔夫和他们》等六册。由莫斯科外文出版社的英译本译出的有《底层》《仇敌》《叶高尔布雷乔夫和他们》，另外三出由耶鲁大学出版社的英译本译出。
    苏联名作家爱伦堡的《暴风雨》已有高清岳、淡文的中译本。爱伦堡最近写信给译者表示谢意。并为中译本撰序文一篇，译出如下：“用中文出版我的小说，我感到荣幸。我深知中国人民在经历了伟大的历史的暴风雨之后，是知道胜利的价值的。我确信中国读者了解苏联人民为自己祖国和全世界人民的自由而斗争的思想和情感。我此书出版的趁机会，来向中国的史诗般伟大的革命表示我的崇敬。它给朋友和敌人表明了中国人民不但能够意识着自己的力量，并且也能意识着自己的真理的力量。”
    西北文学艺术工作者代表大会于去年九月三十日闭幕后，中共中央西北局于十一月十六日发出《关于目前文艺工作几个问题的指示》，首先肯定西北文代会所通过的《团结起来，为建设西北、开展各族人民文艺运动而奋斗》的报告，就是目前党在西北地区文艺运动的方针。西北局并根据各地出席大会代表的反映，指出目前各地党委在领导文艺工作上的主要偏向是对文艺工作的重要意义和党必须领导文艺工作的重要原则认识不足。有的省竟至将文联交给文教厅领导，文教厅则又推给社教科去领导；党在这一时期，对于西北文艺工作的领导，仍沿袭老一套的作法：注重于行政的、琐碎事务的管理，而忽略了思想领导的重要意义，因而降低了党领导文艺工作的积极作用。西北局号召各级党委今后应将文艺工作放进党的工作日程中去。并具体规定党的宣传部门对文艺工作领导的任务：一、检查文艺团体内党员执行党委对文艺工作之方针、任务等决定完成的程度；二、定期总结文艺工作，向党委提出改进文艺工作的意见；三、定期召开文艺干部座谈会，根据党的总的政治任务的要求，研究讨论有关文艺活动或创作思想中的问题。
    最后关于文艺干部的培养问题，西北局指出党的负责部门要具体的指导他们学习，帮助他们熟悉党的各种政策，使他们了解党在每一时期的中心工作方针和任务，并鼓励和关心他们的创作使他们能经常联系实际。对于文艺工作者的缺点应给予善意的批评和教育；以为党的文艺工作者可以马马虎虎，不按党的原则办事的观点是错误的，是有害于文艺干部的培养与进步的。
    华东军政委员会文化部总结了一九五○年抗美援朝戏剧创作，以奖金一千万元，奖给《信陵公子》（越剧，玉兰剧团演出）《群魔末日》（评弹）《三雄惩美记》（评弹）《水泊梁山》（京剧，连同舞台演出）。华东文化部戏改处今后将按月拨发奖金一千万元。奖励华东优秀的新戏演出。上海市戏改处决定每年发给奖金一次，奖给在一年中有优秀成绩的剧团。
