Xinhua News Agency, January 9th: The resolution on the “Current Tasks and Work” of the Nine-Three Society, passed at the working conference of the Nine-Three Society in early December of last year, is as follows:

　　Since the founding of the People’s Republic of China, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, the focus of our Society’s work has been to expand and strengthen the united front together with all democratic parties, people’s organizations, and patriotic individuals, consolidate the people’s democratic dictatorship, implement the Common Program, and develop the various construction undertakings of the new China. Most of our Society’s members serve in the cultural, educational, and scientific fields, and we have made special efforts in cultural construction. We have carried out broader activities among intellectuals than before, absorbed more members, and our ties with democratic parties and people’s organizations have become closer. Over the past year, we have done some work in implementing the Common Program and consolidating and expanding the people’s democratic united front. The political level of our members has improved to a certain extent, and our Society's organization has also developed considerably.

　　This summer (1950), American imperialism launched a war of aggression against Korea, while simultaneously occupying our Taiwan, violating our territorial waters and airspace, and bombing our territory. American imperialism has progressed from blockade and sabotage to armed aggression against the new China. American imperialism is now the most vicious enemy of the Chinese people. It is the protector of the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and the organizer and leader of all reactionary forces opposing the new China.

　　The American imperialist aggression against Korea is the first step in its aggression against China, aggression against Asia, and conquest of the world. From our bloody lessons, we recognize that saving our neighbor is saving ourselves, and resisting America and aiding Korea is the only way to defend our homes and protect our country. Therefore, on November 4th of this year, our Society, along with all democratic parties, jointly issued a joint declaration, vowing to devote all our efforts to supporting the national people in their struggle on a voluntary basis for the sacred task of resisting America, aiding Korea, protecting our homes, and defending our country. This solemn declaration has been warmly responded to and supported by the people of the whole country. We must, together with the people of the whole country, strengthen the united front, consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, uphold, implement, and expand this sacred and just movement of resisting America and aiding Korea. The current stage of our Society’s work is centered on this.

　　1. We should strive to participate in various specific tasks of resisting America and aiding Korea, and contribute all our strength to defend and build the new China.

　　2. We should make special efforts to carry out and deepen the propaganda and education work of resisting America and aiding Korea, expose and combat the pro-American thinking of a few people, patiently persuade those who have fear of America and worship America, and strengthen education in patriotism and internationalism.

　　3. We should join the broad masses of the people in participating in the work of building national defense and consolidating national defense.

　　4. Expand ties with the broad masses of intellectuals, and regularly hold forums and lectures to improve political and academic standards.

　　5. Absorb progressive intellectuals as members and steadily develop the organization.

　　6. Strengthen criticism and self-criticism and study within the Society.

　　九三学社“当前的任务和工作”的决议
    【新华社九日讯】去年十二月初旬九三学社工作会议所通过的关于该社“当前的任务和工作”的决议，全文如下：
    中华人民共和国成立以后，本社在毛主席和中国共产党领导之下，工作中心在于和各民主党派、人民团体及爱国人士一道，扩大并加强统一战线，巩固人民民主专政，实行共同纲领，发展新中国的各种建设事业。本社社员多服务于文教科学界，我们曾特别尽力于文化建设的工作。我们在知识分子中展开了较前更广泛的活动，吸收了较多的社员，与民主党派各人民团体的联系也较前更紧密了。一年多以来，在共同纲领的实施，人民民主统一战线的巩固与扩大方面，我们曾做了一定的工作。社员的政治水平有了一定程度的提高，本社的组织也有了相当的发展。
    美帝国主义今（一九五○年）夏发动了侵略朝鲜的战争，同时占领我台湾，侵犯我领海领空，轰炸我领土。美帝国主义对于新中国已由封锁破坏进而武装侵略。美帝国主义现在是中国人民最凶恶的敌人，他是蒋匪残余的庇护者，他是反对新中国的一切反动势力的组织者与领导者。
    美帝侵略朝鲜，是侵略中国，侵略亚洲，征服世界的第一步。我们从血的教训中，认定救邻即是自救，抗美援朝才能保家卫国。所以在本年十一月四日，本社和各民主党派共同发表联合宣言，誓以全力拥护全国人民在志愿的基础上为抗美援朝，保家卫国的神圣任务而奋斗。这一庄严的宣言，已经得到全国人民的热烈响应和拥护。我们要和全国人民一道，加强统一战线，巩固人民民主专政，坚持、贯彻并扩大抗美援朝这一神圣与正义的运动。本社现阶段的工作，即以此为中心。
    一、我们应该努力参加抗美援朝的各种具体工作，为保卫和建设新中国而贡献我们所有的力量。
    二、我们应该特别努力于开展并深入抗美援朝的宣传教育工作，揭露并打击少数人的亲美思想，对有恐美、崇美思想的人进行耐心的说服，加强爱国主义和国际主义的教育。
    三、我们应该和广大人民在一道，参加建设国防和巩固国防的工作。
    四、扩大与广大知识分子的联系，并经常举行座谈会与讲演会，以提高政治水平和学术水平。
    五、吸收进步知识分子为社员稳步发展组织。
    六、加强社内的批评与自我批评和学习。
