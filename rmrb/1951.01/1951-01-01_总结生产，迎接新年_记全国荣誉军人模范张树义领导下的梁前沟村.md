Summarizing Production, Welcoming the New Year
    --On Liangqiangou Village Under the Leadership of National Honorary Disabled Soldier Model Zhang Shuyi
    By Our Correspondent Lu Sheng
    In the autumn of 1950, Liangqiangou Village, the third district of Lingshou County, Hebei Province, did three major things well, earning praise from the people of the whole county and spreading throughout the province.
    The first major event was that the village's production level in 1950 exceeded any previous year. A total of 313,600 jin of grain was harvested, with an average yield per mu exceeding 20 jin compared to before the war (the highest yield per mu before the war was 140 jin, which had fallen to 126 jin during the war, recovered to 140 jin in 1949, and increased to 160 jin in 1950). In addition, 40,000 jin of rice were harvested, and 12,000 jin of cotton were picked.
    The second major event was that the village paid the public grain quickly and well in the autumn of 1950, exceeding the task, ranking first in the entire district.
    The third major event was that winter production in the village was done well in 1950. Most of Liangqiangou Village is mountainous, and winter production mainly involves collecting firewood and accumulating fertilizer. Currently, the village can collect 1,600 jin of firewood every day. By the end of the lunar year, in addition to collecting enough firewood to burn before the wheat harvest in 1951, another 200,000 jin can be sold. The village's five large carts and ten small carts have started transportation, and each cart can earn an average of more than 30 jin of rice per day. Every household in the village raises one to two fattened pigs and feeds three to five hens. Women sew shoe soles during the day and attend winter school at night. Each household has accumulated one and a half circles of fertilizer (200 dan per circle), and some have accumulated up to three circles. The fertilizer has already begun to be transported to the fields and can all be delivered in winter to facilitate early plowing and planting in the spring of 1951. During the day, no idle people can be found in the village.
    How did this village accomplish these three major events? Any farmer in the village will tell you this: Our village has the leadership of half-man Lao Zhang! Or: Because we have the honorary disabled soldier model, the legless hero Zhang Shuyi!
    Zhang Shuyi was originally a poor farmer in Shanmenkou Village. After the Anti-Japanese War, he was the first farmer in the village to respond to the Communist Party's call to resist Japan. Later, in the Battle of Longquanguan, after killing more than 30 Japanese invaders, both of his legs were honorably disabled. After recovering from his injuries, he retired from the army and returned to the village to engage in production and lead the people in guerrilla warfare, producing while fighting. After the Japanese invaders surrendered, Chiang Kai-shek, with the support of the American imperialists, launched an attack on the liberated areas. He once again led the farmers of the village to join the army, participate in the war, and support the front lines. After the national victory, he continued to lead the farmers in reclaiming wasteland and digging canals; he educated the farmers in intensive cultivation, teaching them methods such as seed soaking, seed selection, and pest and disease control. By 1949, the village's production had reached pre-war levels, and in 1950 it exceeded pre-war levels.
    At the end of August 1950, Zhang Shuyi was honorably selected as a representative to attend the National Congress of Labor Models of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers. At the meeting, he met the people's leader Chairman Mao, whom he had long yearned to see. After returning to the village, he became even more active in his work, crawling back and forth to every small mountain village in the area to organize the farmers to carry out the autumn harvest. After the autumn harvest, just as the American imperialists were frantically expanding their war of aggression against Korea, he led the farmers in autumn plowing while calling on everyone to pay public grain quickly. He used the contrast between present and past life to educate the farmers: before the Anti-Japanese War, landlords occupied more than 1,500 mu of the village's 1,960 mu of land, and there were more than 90 poor and tenant farmers out of 137 households in the village. Since the land reform, more than 90 poor and tenant farmers have all risen to become middle peasants. Zhang Shuyi himself not only has enough to eat and wear now, but the grain he harvested in 1950 is enough for him to eat for a year and a half. There are more than 90 households like Zhang Shuyi in the village. In addition to establishing a regular primary school, the village has also newly established three community schools. Farmers think about the past, look at the present, and look to the future, shouting: "We will never be slaves of a foreign power for the second time!" All the public grain in the village was paid up within three days.
    On December 24, Zhang Shuyi and village cadres jointly convened a meeting of mutual aid teams in the village to summarize the production achievements of this year and preliminarily formulate a production plan for next year. At the meeting, Zhang Shuyi first reported the production achievements and plans of his family to set an example for the people in the village. He said: "This year, under the call of the government, my family used more fertilizer, plowed more, and hoed more, and harvested 30 large shi of grain (each shi is 320 city jin) from 18 mu of land, which is 13 shi more than last year, and more than three times the average pre-war production level per mu. Next year, my family will use more fertilizer, plow more, and hoe more, and also pay attention to agricultural technology, striving to harvest 36 shi of grain and achieve 'cultivating one and surplus one'. My guarantees for achieving 'cultivating one and surplus one' are: (1) Transform 3.5 mu of dry land into paddy fields, which can produce 1.5 dou more of refined grain. (2) Intercrop small cantaloupes in 3.7 mu of cotton fields, and selling the cantaloupes can be equivalent to harvesting a season of summer grain without hindering the growth of cotton. According to this year's experience, at least 1.5 shi of refined grain can be increased. (3) Reclaim another 3 mu of virgin land, which can produce 1.5 dou more of refined grain. (4) Raise a sow to produce piglets, which can increase at least 1 shi of rice. (5) Reclaim 4 mu of cultivated wasteland to plant peanuts, which can harvest 800 jin of peanuts, which can be exchanged for 800 jin of millet. (6) Next year, we must use more fertilizer, plow more, and hoe more than this year, plus the division of labor and cooperation of my family of six, we will definitely be able to achieve 'cultivating one and surplus one'. In addition, I must always pay attention to studying culture, and next year strive to be able to read newspapers and understand documents. In addition to continuing to lead the mutual aid teams in Liangqiangou Village well, I must also help the mutual aid teams in Shanmenkou Village to truly achieve voluntary combination and equivalent exchange of labor. Help all the families of martyrs and soldiers in the village to cultivate their land well, and often visit and comfort the families of martyrs and soldiers, and earnestly help them solve their difficulties. We must also often educate the farmers to recognize the aggressive conspiracy of the American imperialists, and be ready at any time to contribute all our strength to support the Korean People's Army and our Chinese People's Volunteers, and work harder to produce and support the front lines to defeat the American imperialist aggressors."
    All the village cadres and farmers of the mutual aid teams took Zhang Shuyi's production plan as an example, and discussed and summarized from household to team, and from team to village, and formulated a preliminary production plan for 1951. In the summary, everyone unanimously recognized the reason for the increase in production in 1950, mainly due to the implementation of Chairman Mao's "Organize!" through mutual aid in production under the leadership of Zhang Shuyi. There are 137 households and 520 people in the village, including 80 full and semi-able-bodied men and 86 full and semi-able-bodied women, and 72 cattle and donkeys; these labor and livestock were all organized in 1950. There are 15 mutual aid teams in the village, of which 9 can achieve regular mutual aid and equivalent exchange of labor, and the remaining 6 are mutual aid during the busy farming season. Mutual aid saved labor and increased production. In 1950, the village saved a total of 2,333 workdays, all of which were used for accumulating fertilizer and modifying agricultural tools; in 1950, the village reclaimed a total of 100 mu of virgin land, harvested 40 large shi of grain, and repaired two irrigation canals, turning 300 mu of dry land into paddy fields, and 100 mu of irrigated land into rice fields, and 70 mu of slope land into flat land, all of which directly increased production. In the autumn of 1949, all the land in the village was universally tilled once, and in the spring of 1950, it was universally plowed twice and harrowed three times. In 1949, an average of 35 dan of fertilizer was applied per mu, and in 1950, 70 dan was applied to dry land and 100 dan to paddy land. In the spring, the wheat in paddy fields was hoeed twice, and the wheat in dry fields was hoeed once. During sowing, most households soaked and mixed the seeds. Millet was hoeed three times, corn was hoeed four times, and cotton was hoeed seven times. During the summer harvest, farmers universally selected wheat seeds, and in the autumn of 1950, they universally selected millet and corn seeds. In the past, this village had never planted cotton. In 1950, the village planted 120 mu, and picked a total of 12,000 jin of cotton. In the autumn, under the leadership of Zhang Shuyi, autumn tilling was universally carried out, and 340 mu of wheat was planted, with an average of 100 dan of fertilizer applied per mu. In addition to planting wheat, the village also set aside 300 mu of good land, preparing to plant cotton in 1951. These tasks laid the foundation for the increase in production in 1951.
    At the meeting, the village cadres and Zhang Shuyi combined the production plans of each household and team, and formulated a preliminary production plan for 1951. The overall production goal is to increase grain and cotton production. In terms of grain, we must strive to produce 30 jin more per mu than in 1950, and in terms of cotton, we must strive to pick 20 jin more per mu than in 1950. In order to achieve the goal of increasing production, first, we must do a good job in winter production, and deliver all the fertilizer to the fields before the Lunar New Year, so as to facilitate early plowing and planting in 1951; second, in 1951, we must strive to apply 100 dan of fertilizer per mu of paddy land and 80 dan of fertilizer per mu of dry land, and strive to plow four times, harrow four times, and hoe four times, and cotton must be hoeed eight times; third, in 1951, all 15 mutual aid teams in the village must achieve voluntary combination and equivalent exchange of labor; fourth, in addition to cultivating the 100 mu of virgin land reclaimed in 1950, we must reclaim another 50 mu of virgin land; fifth, in the spring of 1951, we must start early to repair the old irrigation canals and strive to irrigate another 30 mu of dry land; sixth, build a 4 li long earthen embankment to protect the land along the river from being washed away; seventh, we must do a better job of substituting for others in farming; eighth, we must make the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and defending our homes a regular task, and be ready at any time to contribute all our strength to fight against the American imperialist aggressors.
    Finally, the farmers of the whole village unanimously decided to do these tasks well to wish Chairman Mao a Happy New Year.

　　总结生产，迎接新年
    ——记全国荣誉军人模范张树义领导下的梁前沟村
    本报记者  鲁生
    河北省灵寿县第三区梁前沟村，一九五○年秋有三件大事做得好，博得了全县人民的称赞，并传遍了全省。
    第一件大事是：全村一九五○年生产水平超过已往任何一年。计共收粮食三十一万三千六百斤，平均每亩产量超过战前二十斤（战前每亩最高产量为一百四十斤，战时曾降至一百二十六斤，一九四九年恢复到一百四十斤，一九五○年增至一百六十斤）。此外，还收了四万斤稻子，摘了一万二千斤棉花。
    第二件大事是：全村一九五○年秋缴公粮又快又好，并超额完成任务，为全区第一。
    第三件大事是：全村一九五○年冬季生产搞得好。梁前沟村大部是山沟，冬季生产主要是打柴和积肥。现全村每天可以打柴一千六百斤，到旧历年底，除能打够一九五一年麦收前烧用外，还可卖出二十万斤。全村五辆大车和十辆小车已搞起运输，平均每天每辆车可挣米三十多斤。全村每家都养着一只到两只肥猪，喂着三只到五只母鸡。妇女们白天纳鞋底，夜里上冬学。每家已积肥一圈半（每圈二百担），有的积到三圈。并已开始往地里运送，冬季可以全部送完，以利一九五一年春季早耕早种。白天，全村找不到一个闲人。
    这村怎样做出这三件大事来的呢？村里任何一个农民都会这样告诉你：俺村因为有半截人老张的领导。或是说：因为有了荣誉军人模范没腿英雄张树义！
    张树义原是山门口村的一个贫苦农民。抗战以后，他是这村第一个响应共产党的号召，起来抗日的农民。后来他在龙泉关战斗中，打死日寇三十多人后，自己的双腿光荣残废了。伤好后，就退伍回村生产，并领导人民进行游击战争，一边生产，一边战斗。日寇投降后，蒋介石在美帝支持下向解放区进攻，他又领导全村农民参军，参战，支援前线。全国胜利后，他继续领导农民开荒，开渠；教育农民精耕细作，教会了农民浸种、选种和防治病虫害等办法。到一九四九年，全村生产即达到战前水平，一九五○年更超过战前水平。
    一九五○年八月底，张树义光荣地被选为出席全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议的代表。在会上，他见到了渴望已久的人民领袖毛主席。回村后，他工作更加积极起来，每天来回爬行在全村各个小山庄，组织农民进行秋收。秋收后，正值美帝疯狂扩大侵朝战争的时候，他一面领导农民进行秋耕，一面号召大家快缴公粮。他拿现在和过去生活的对比来教育农民：抗战前，全村一千九百六十亩地，地主占去一千五百多亩，全村一百三十七户，有九十多户贫雇农。自土地改革之后，到现在，九十多户贫雇农已全上升为中农。张树义自己，现在不但有了吃穿，而且在一九五○年打的粮食，就足够一年半吃的。全村像张树义的户有九十多户。全村除已建立一所正规小学外，又新办了三所民校。农民想想过去，看看现在，望望将来，喊出了：“决不再做第二次亡国奴”的吼声。全村公粮在三天之内便全部缴齐了。
    十二月二十四日，张树义和村干部共同召集全村互助组开会，总结今年的生产成绩，并初步拟订了明年的生产计划。会上，张树义先报告了他家的生产成绩和计划，以便给全村人们作出一个榜样。他说：“我家今年在政府的号召下，多上粪，多犁，多锄，十八亩地收了三十大石粮（每石为三百二十市斤），比去年多打十三石，每亩超过战前常年生产水平三倍多。明年我家更要多犁多锄多上粪，还要讲求农业技术，争取打三十六石粮食，做到耕一余一。我争取耕一余一的保证条件是：（一）把三亩半旱地改造成水田，可多打一石五斗细粮。（二）在三亩七分棉地里带种小甜瓜，卖了甜瓜可顶收一季夏粮，还不误棉花生长。按今年的经验，最少可增产细粮一石五斗。（三）再开三亩生荒，可多打一石五斗细粮。（四）喂一只母猪下猪娃，至少可增加一石米。（五）开四亩熟荒种花生，可收八百斤花生，可换八百斤小米。（六）明年比今年要更多上粪多犁多锄，再加上我全家六口人的分工合作，一定可以做到耕一余一。此外，我还要经常注意学习文化，明年争取能读下报纸，看懂文件。除继续领导好梁前沟村的互助组外，还要帮助全山门口村的互助组真正做到自愿结合、等价换工。帮助全村烈、军属种好地，并经常慰问烈、军属，切实帮助他们解决困难。还要经常教育农民认清美帝的侵略阴谋，随时准备拿出一切力量支援朝鲜人民军和我人民志愿军，为击败美帝国主义侵略将更努力生产，支援前线。”
    全村干部和全体互助组农民，都以张树义的生产计划为榜样，从户到组，从组到村进行了讨论和总结，并订出了一九五一年生产的初步计划。在总结中，大家一致认识了一九五○年增产的原因，主要是在张树义的领导下，实行了毛主席“组织起来”生产互助的结果。全村共一百三十七户，五百二十口人，其中有男全半劳动力八十个，女全半劳动力八十六个，有牛、驴七十二头；这些劳、畜力在一九五○年都全部组织起来。全村共有十五个互助组，其中有九个可以做到经常互助，等价换工，其余六个是在农忙时互助。进行互助节省了人工和提高了生产。一九五○年全村共省工二千三百三十三个，都用在积肥和改制农具上；全村一九五○年共开生荒一百亩，收四十大石粮食，修好两条水渠，使三百亩旱地变成了水田，又把一百亩水浇地改为稻田，七十亩坡地修成平地，这些都直接增加了产量。一九四九年秋全村土地都普遍垡过一遍，一九五○年春又普遍犁了两遍，耙了三遍。一九四九年每亩平均上三十五担粪，一九五○年每亩旱地上到七十担，水地上到一百担。春天麦子水地做到了普锄两遍，旱地做到普锄一遍。下种时，大部分户都进行了浸种拌种。谷子做到普锄三遍，玉茭普锄四遍，棉花普锄七遍。夏收时，农民普遍选了麦种，一九五○年秋又普遍选了谷种和玉茭种。过去这村没有种过棉花，一九五○年全村种了一百二十亩，共摘棉花一万二千斤。秋季又在张树义的领导下，普遍进行了秋垡地，种下三百四十亩麦子，每亩平均上粪一百担。除种麦子外，全村又留出三百亩好地，准备一九五一年种棉花。这些工作都给一九五一年的增产打下了基础。
    会上，村干部和张树义把各户各组的生产计划综合起来，拟订了一九五一年生产的初步计划。总的生产目标是增产粮食和棉花。粮食方面要争取每亩比一九五○年多打三十斤，棉花每亩比一九五○年多摘二十斤。为达到增产目的，第一，要把冬季生产工作做好，旧历年以前把粪全部送到地里，以便一九五一年早耕早种；第二，一九五一年每亩地要争取水地上粪一百担，旱地上粪八十担，争取犁四耙四锄四遍，棉花要争取锄到八遍；第三，一九五一年要把全村十五个互助组全做到自愿结合、等价换工；第四，除把一九五○年开的一百亩生荒种好外，再开五十亩生荒；第五，一九五一年春要早动手，把旧水渠整理好，争取再多浇三十亩旱地；第六，修好四里长的一条土堤，保护沿河土地不受水冲；第七，要把代耕工作做得更好；第八，要把抗美援朝保家卫国的工作做为经常工作，时时准备拿出一切力量来，为击败美帝国主义的侵略而斗争。
    最后，全村农民一致决议，要以做好这些工作来向毛主席拜新年。
