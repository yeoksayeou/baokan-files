Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 26th: Indian Prime Minister Nehru, in a radio address on the 24th, stated: "For the past year or more, we have been advocating that the new China should be given a seat in the successful global consultative organization. However, this has not been done. But many people now realize that if this obvious fact had been recognized earlier, the fate of the world might have been very different." Nehru criticized "some people who are unwilling to accept the great changes taking place in Asia" and "some people who still treat the great powers of Asia with old methods." Nehru stated, "The emergence of this new Asia is a major event of our time. The emergence of the new Asia has broken the old balance and contrast of power. If we are to treat today's world with a realistic attitude, we must recognize this fact." Nehru supported resolving the Korean issue through peaceful negotiations. He said, "If the Far East problem is resolved smoothly, the great tension existing in the world today can be relieved, and the resolution of other Asian and European problems will be easier."

　　尼赫鲁发表广播演说
　  主张和平谈判解决朝鲜问题
    【新华社二十六日讯】新德里讯：印度总理尼赫鲁于二十四日发表广播称：“过去一年多以来，我们一直主张应当让新中国在成功湖的世界性的协商组织中得到一席位。然而这没有办到，但是，许多人现在已认识到：如果以前承认这种明明白白的事实的话，那样，世界的命运也许会大不相同了。”尼赫鲁指摘“有些人不愿意接受降临亚洲的巨大变革”，“有些人还用老办法来对待亚洲的大国”。尼赫鲁称：“这个新亚洲的出现是我们时代的一件大事，新亚洲的出现已打破旧的实力的平衡和对比，如果我们要用现实的态度对待今天的世界的话，我们就必须承认这个事实。”尼赫鲁支持用和平谈判的方法解决朝鲜问题。他说：“如果远东问题得到顺利的解决，就可以解除今日存在于全世界的极大的紧张局面，而且使其他亚洲和欧洲问题的解决更为容易。”
