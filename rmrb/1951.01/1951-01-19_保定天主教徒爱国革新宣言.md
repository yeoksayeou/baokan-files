To Catholic friends and people from all walks of life in various regions:

　　For over a century, imperialism has used every means to invade China, causing immense humiliation and suffering to our Chinese nation. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Chinese people, through arduous struggle, defeated the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang instigated by American imperialism and achieved a great victory. However, American imperialism is not reconciled to its defeat and has launched the brutal act of invading Korea and occupying our territory of Taiwan. Our people across the country, filled with righteous indignation, have launched a great patriotic movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country.

　　In the great patriotic movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country, patriotic figures in the Chinese Catholic Church have also begun a patriotic self-reliance and reform movement. First, Father Wang Liangzuo, a Chinese priest in Guangyuan County, Northern Sichuan, led over five hundred Catholics in issuing a declaration of self-reliance and reform. Following this, Catholic figures in Suiyuan, Chongqing, Nanchang, Wuhan, Jiajiang in Western Sichuan, and Yuechi in Northern Sichuan responded one after another. We, representing the Catholics of Baoding, warmly support and respond to this patriotic reform movement, resolutely severing all ties with imperialism and establishing a self-governing, self-supporting, and self-propagating Catholic Church. American imperialism uses religion as a tool for aggression, engaging in destructive activities and defiling the sanctity of the Church. We, the Catholics of Baoding, stand wholeheartedly on the side of the people, opposing Austin's shameless slander. We are willing to unite with the people of the whole country, participate in the patriotic movement, and strive for the independence, peace, and happiness of our motherland, and work hard to establish a self-governing, self-supporting, and self-propagating Catholic Church in Baoding.

　　We warmly support the decision of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council regarding the handling of cultural, educational, relief organizations, and religious groups receiving American subsidies, because this decision fully conforms to the interests of the Chinese people. We firmly support the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the policies and decrees of the Central People's Government. Under the leadership of the People's Government, we will complete the sacred task of patriotic reform of the Catholic Church in Baoding with our own strength.

　　保定天主教徒爱国革新宣言各地教友、各界人士：
    百余年来，帝国主义千方百计侵略中国，我中华民族所受凌辱及灾难极为深重。中国人民在毛主席领导下，经过艰苦奋斗，打垮了美帝国主义主使的蒋介石匪帮，取得了伟大的胜利；而美帝国主义却不甘心它的失败，竟发动侵略朝鲜的暴行，并侵占我国领土台湾。我全国人民激于义愤，兴起了抗美援朝保家卫国的伟大的爱国主义运动。
    在伟大的抗美援朝保家卫国运动中，我国天主教爱国人士亦开始了自立革新的爱国主义运动。首先，川北广元县中国神父王良佐领导五百余天主教徒发表了自立革新宣言，接着有绥远、重庆、南昌、武汉、川西的夹江、川北的岳池等处的天主教人士纷纷响应。我们代表保定天主教徒热烈拥护与响应这种爱国主义革新运动，坚决与帝国主义割断各方面的关系，建立自治、自养、自传的天主教会。美帝国主义利用宗教作为侵略工具，进行破坏活动，玷污了教会的圣洁。我们保定的天主教徒，一心站在人民这一边，反对奥斯汀的无耻谰言。我们愿与全国人民团结在一起，参加爱国运动，为我们祖国的独立和平与幸福而奋斗。为建立自治、自养、自传的保定天主教会而努力。
    我们热烈拥护中央人民政府政务院关于处理接受美国津贴的文化教育救济机关及宗教团体的方针的决定，因为这个决定完全符合中国人民的利益。我们坚决拥护中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领及中央人民政府的政策法令，在人民政府的领导下，以自己的力量，完成保定天主教爱国革新的神圣任务。
    保定天主教总堂代理主教骆伯宾，司铎任司直、陈良、马雅伯、韩度，修女会若瑟院院长李凤斋，南关公教医院院长吕渭公，南关天主堂司铎赵之璧，西关公教育婴院院长师耀灵，西关修道院院长姬永贤，城内真道学校校长侯清如、南关淑慎学校校长安凤璞，西关志仁学校校长蔺明智，教民代表张鑫元、范茂盛、张瑞恒、侯景芝、李维九、张穰民、侯鸿波、潘德世、萧貌愚、苏润生、刘若翰、李追远、贾融、侯景雨、侯鸿文、王其威、师玛弟、蔡醒吾、李道宁。一九五一年元月十四日
