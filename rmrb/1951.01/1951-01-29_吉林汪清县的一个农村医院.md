　　A Rural Hospital in Wangqing County, Jilin
    Last summer, a plague of measles broke out in Jiguan Village, Third District, Wangqing County, Jilin Province, killing more than fifty children, causing great fear among the people. After learning about this situation, the District Committee helped to establish a hospital in the village, hiring two Western doctors. The village cooperative withdrew 150 million yuan (Northeast currency) to purchase various medicines from Shenyang, providing basic equipment. This hospital fully serves the farmers. After starting treatment, it achieved great results. Sun Yuanming's wife had been ill and unable to move for more than four months, and many people said there was no hope. After more than twenty days of treatment by the doctor, she fully recovered and actively participated in production. Martyr Yuan Yongfa had suffered from eye disease for more than ten years and could not see people's faces. The doctor performed two operations on him, and now he is like a healthy person. The old man Yuan Yongfa is extremely happy. The hospital gives special care to the families of martyrs, and medicines are discounted for them. Because of the hospital, the diseases of the masses have gradually decreased, and the production enthusiasm of the masses is very high. Not only has the village benefited, but it is also convenient for the masses in nearby villages to seek medical treatment. In order to take care of the farmers' production, the hospital provides medical care at any time, day or night. Liu Guoan from Yingbi Village became ill and could not speak, and his life was in danger. The doctor rushed to treat him at ten o'clock at night, and now he is well. These concrete facts have educated the masses, and the views of not valuing and not trusting Western medicine have changed. Everyone has begun to believe in science.
