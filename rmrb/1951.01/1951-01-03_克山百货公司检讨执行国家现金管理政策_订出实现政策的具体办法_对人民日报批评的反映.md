　　Keshan Department Store Reviews Implementation of National Cash Management Policy
    Formulates Specific Measures to Achieve the Policy
    Response to Criticism from the People's Daily
Editor:
    The criticism by Comrade Wu Diankun in your newspaper on December 15th, regarding our company's violation of the cash management system, is correct. We sincerely accept it. Our reply and self-criticism are as follows.
    In the past, our understanding of the cash management system was unclear, and the implementation of the policy was very poor. In our leadership, we simply focused on recovering funds and did not pay attention to expenditures. We also mistakenly believed that food expenses and automobile freight charges were not part of the expenditure ledger and did not need to be deposited in the bank. Therefore, when expenditure funds were insufficient, we often borrowed from them, resulting in two instances where we paid cash to units that should have been settled by transfer.
    Our leadership work was not thorough. Although we sometimes checked the accounts, we only compared the cash balance with the ledger balance and did not check how the cash management system was being implemented. The bank office gave us advice on these issues, but we did not pay attention to it. This shows that we are not humble and did not realize that this was a violation of the national system.
    After the bank office's inspection, we promptly corrected the situation. After seeing the newspaper report this time, we discussed with the accounting section chief and the secretary section chief and decided: (1) We will definitely not pay cash to units that should be settled by transfer in the future. If there is cash at home, we will first send it to the bank; (2) The cash inventory will not exceed the quota. If the inventory is large, we will definitely deposit it in the bank every night; (3) The accounts will definitely not be backlogged anymore.
    The criticism in the newspaper this time has been of great help to us, enabling us to deeply recognize that this is a violation of national financial and economic discipline. We will definitely strengthen our study of policies and implement them in the future, ensuring that such incidents do not happen again.

　　克山百货公司检讨执行国家现金管理政策
    订出实现政策的具体办法
    对人民日报批评的反映编辑同志：
    咱报十二月十五日发表吴殿坤同志批评我公司违犯现金管理制度，吴同志的批评是正确的，我们诚恳接受。兹答复并检讨如下。
    过去我们对现金管理制度认识不明确，体现政策很差，在领导上单纯地注意回笼款，未注意开支款，并错误地认为伙食款和汽车运费不在开支账内用不着存银行，所以在开支款不足时，就时常借着用，因而有两次对应该转账单位付了现金。
    领导工作不深入，虽然有时检查账，但只是对照现金与账面是否相符，并未检查现金管理制度执行如何。这些情况，银行办事处给我们提过意见，但未引起我们注意，这表现了我们不虚心，同时也未认识到这是违犯国家制度的行为。
    前次银行办事处检查后，我们已及时纠正。这次看到报纸，我们又和会计股长、秘书股长研究确定：（１）今后转账单位一定不付现金，如家内有现金先送银行去；（２）现金库存不超过定额，如库存多时，每晚一定交存银行。（３）账目决定再不积压了。
    这次报纸的批评对我们帮助很大，使我们深刻地认识这是违犯国家财经纪律了。今后一定加强研究政策，执行政策。做到再也不发生此类事情。
                                            黑龙江省克山百货公司
                                                    十二月二十三日
