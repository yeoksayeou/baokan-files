Xinhua News Agency, January 12th: The Chinese People's Committee to Defend World Peace and Oppose American Aggression held a general meeting this afternoon to welcome Wu Xiuquan, the special representative of our country to the United Nations Security Council and the Political and Security Committee to accuse the United States of aggression against China, who recently returned to China. Over 1,200 people attended, including cadres from the Chinese People's Committee to Defend World Peace and Oppose American Aggression, its Beijing branch, various democratic parties, and people's organizations.

Chen Shutong, Vice Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee to Defend World Peace and Oppose American Aggression, first delivered a welcoming speech. He said: Our country's representative's attendance at the United Nations meeting to accuse the crimes of armed aggression by American imperialism has won the sympathy of the people of the world. He said: The righteous voice of our People's Republic of China, issued for the first time at the United Nations, has quickly spread throughout the world, inspiring the determination and courage of millions of people to defend peace. This, like the victory of the Chinese and Korean People's forces on the Korean battlefield, has made a great contribution to the cause of world peace.

Wu Xiuquan began his report on the process of accusing American imperialism at the United Nations meeting and its significant impact amidst warm applause. When he described the Chinese people's representative's first accusation of American imperialism's crimes of aggression at the United Nations meeting, bursts of excited applause erupted in the hall. Wu Xiuquan said: Although the case of accusing the United States of aggression against Taiwan was rejected by the voting machine manipulated by the United States, the solemn accusation of the Chinese people has had a huge impact on the people of the world. He pointed out that the reason why our representative was able to successfully complete this mission and achieve a great political victory was due to the unprecedented growth of the strength of the world democratic camp led by the Soviet Union, the historic victory of the Chinese people under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, and especially the great victory of the Chinese and Korean people on the Korean battlefield.

    首由中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会副主席陈叔通致欢迎词。他说：这次我国代表出席联合国会议，指控美帝国主义武装侵略的罪行，获得了全世界人民的同情。他说：我们中华人民共和国的代表第一次在联合国中所发出的正义的声音，迅速地传遍了全世界，鼓舞着千百万人民保卫和平的决心与勇气。这和中朝人民部队在朝鲜战场上的胜利一样，对世界和平事业作了伟大的贡献。
    伍修权在热烈的掌声中开始报告出席联合国会议控诉美帝国主义的经过及其重大影响。当他叙述中国人民代表第一次在联合国会议上控诉美帝国主义侵略罪行时，会场上不断响起了兴奋的掌声。伍修权说：控诉美国侵略台湾案虽被美国操纵的表决机器否决，但是，中国人民的庄严的控诉已在全世界人民中产生了巨大的影响。他指出：我国代表所以能顺利地完成此次任务，并获得巨大的政治上的胜利是由于以苏联为首的世界民主阵营力量的空前增长，由于中国人民在毛主席和中央人民政府领导下所获得的历史性的胜利，特别是由于中朝人民在朝鲜战场上的伟大胜利。
