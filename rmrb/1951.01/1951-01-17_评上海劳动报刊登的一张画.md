Review of a Painting Published in the Shanghai Labor Daily

　　During the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, many satirical cartoons with ideological depth emerged across the country. These cartoons were well-received by the broad masses of readers. In factories, railways, cultural centers, schools, and parades, these satirical cartoons were often depicted on blackboards or banners. The reason these cartoons were welcomed and loved by readers was that they very accurately and analytically explained a problem, using artistic images to represent significant issues in the current political or military struggle. Therefore, for readers, they could help them correctly understand these issues, and thus played a certain educational role.

　　However, there were also some paintings that, because the author's own understanding of the problem was vague or incorrect, inevitably reflected these incorrect ideas in a concrete work, which was harmful and unhelpful to readers. For example, on January 1st of this year, the Shanghai General Labor Union's newspaper, the Labor Daily, published a satirical cartoon by Comrade Cheng De. This painting had no title, but it excerpted a passage from the People's Daily editorial "The American Ruling Class in Confusion and Division" – "On the Korean battlefield, as far as the imperialist camp is concerned, they have already gathered the forces they can currently gather. As far as the peaceful and democratic camp is concerned, the forces in Korea are only a very small part of our strength." as an explanation for this painting. If we could correctly use images to represent this issue, so that readers understand the strength comparison between the two camps—the strength of the people's forces and the enemy's outwardly strong but inwardly weak nature—it would be very educational. However, in this painting, two teams of people are shown across a river in a "tug-of-war." The words "Korean War" are written in the middle of the rope. On one end of the rope is a small group of imperialist elements waving the flag of the aggressive camp, and on the other end are two people, representing the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. Behind these two people is a group of people waving the flag of the world peace camp. The author's attempt to show the quantity of people and the amount of strength is visible, but using this to represent the strength of the aggressive camp and the peaceful camp is an inexcusable distortion. Because what is seen in the picture is that since the aggressive camp is using the rope in the "struggle for the Korean War" as a metaphor for aggression, then what is the explanation for the actions of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army pulling the rope on this side of the river? The war we are waging is just and anti-aggression; the war waged by the aggressive group is unjust and aggressive. However, in the picture, it becomes a "tug-of-war" of you fighting to grab, and an extremely wrong depiction of the great, patriotic, and internationalist just war of anti-aggression waged by the Korean People's Army and the Chinese Volunteer Army.

　　This error is mainly because the author has an incorrect understanding of the nature of the Korean War. The painter's ideological understanding and his work's expression are consistent. If the painter's understanding of a problem is vague and not profound, then his work will naturally express vagueness and lack of depth. Even a metaphor used in a satirical cartoon (such as the tug-of-war in this painting) is mainly due to the author's lack of correct analysis of the problem and the use of an incorrect metaphor. This painting should alert all our satirical cartoonists that we should constantly strengthen our political study. If we study Marxism-Leninism and carefully study the newspaper's editorials, we will not have such a wrong understanding of the Korean War. The exaggeration, metaphors, and other artistic expression techniques used in satirical cartoons must also be very accurate and consistent with the political content we want to express. On the other hand, since satirical cartoons play a very good role among the masses, precisely because such a weapon is a powerful educational tool, then we should seriously treat the ideological effect of a work. In this way, satirical cartoons can play a role in striking at the enemy and educating the people. The editors of the Labor Daily and the author of this painting neglected the educational role that a painting plays for the workers, which is an extremely inappropriate political oversight.

　　评上海劳动报刊登的一张画
    在抗美援朝的运动中，全国各地都产生了许多富有思想性的讽刺画，这些画受着广大读者的欢迎，在工厂中，铁路上，文化馆里，学校里和游行队伍中，常常把这些讽刺画描在黑板上或标语牌上；这些画所以受着读者的欢迎和喜爱，是因为这些画非常确切而又有分析地说明一个问题，用艺术的形象来表现了当前政治或军事斗争中的重大问题，因此对于读者来说，可以帮助他们正确地去认识这些问题，也就起着一定的教育作用。
    但是也有一些画因为作者本身对问题认识是模糊的或是错误的，因此这些不正确的思想就一定反映到一张具体的作品中去，对于读者来说是有害而无益的；例如今年一月一日的上海总工会的机关报——劳动报，刊登了承德同志画的一幅讽刺画，这幅画没有标题，但是摘录了人民日报社论“美国统治阶级在混乱和分裂中”的一段——“在朝鲜战场上，对于帝国主义阵营来说，他们已经集合了目前可能集合的力量，对于和平民主阵营来说，在朝鲜的力量，只是我们的力量的很小的部分。”作为这幅画的说明，如果我们能够正确地用形象来表现这个问题，使读者了解两个阵营的力量对比——人民力量的强大和敌人的外强中干，这是很有教育意义的。然而在这幅画上却是两队人马隔着一条河在作“拔河比赛”拔河的绳子中间写着“朝鲜战争”四个字，绳的一端是一小撮打着侵略阵营旗号的帝国主义分子，另一端却是两个人，代表着朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿部队，这两个人的后边又有一群打着世界和平阵营旗帜的人；作者企图表现人数和力量的多寡是看得出的，但是这样来表现侵略阵营与和平阵营的力量，却成为不可原谅的歪曲。因为在画面上看到的，既然把侵略阵营在“争夺朝鲜战争”的那根绳子是作为侵略的比喻，那么在河岸这边扯着绳子的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿部队的行动又当作何解释呢？我们进行的战争是正义的，反侵略的，侵略集团进行的战争是非正义的和侵略的，而在画面上却变成你争我夺的“拔河竞赛”，而对于朝鲜人民军和中国志愿军所进行伟大的，充满了爱国主义和国际主义的正义的反侵略战争作了极端错误的描写。
    这种错误主要是作者对于朝鲜战争的性质有着不正确的认识，画家的思想认识和他的作品表现是一致的，如果画家对一个问题认识是模糊的，不深刻的，那么在他的作品中也自然表现着模糊和不深刻，即使在讽刺画上所运用的一个比喻（例如这幅画的拔河）也主要是由于作者对于问题没有正确分析而运用了错误的比喻。从这幅画中就要引起我们所有的讽刺画家们，应当时时刻刻加强我们的政治学习，如果我们学了马列主义，仔细地研究了报纸的社论，就不会对朝鲜战争有着这样错误的认识。在讽刺画的夸张，比喻等艺术表现手法上也必需十分确切和符合我们所要表现的政治内容。另一方面既然讽刺画在群众中起着很好的作用，正因为这样的武器是一种有力的教育工具，那么我们就应该严肃地对待一张作品所发生的思想效果。这样，讽刺画才能起着打击敌人和教育人民的作用。劳动报的编辑和这幅画的作者忽略了一幅画对工人们所起的教育作用，这都是极不应有的政治疏忽。
