　　Beijing Union Medical College Holds Evening Party to Celebrate New Life
	Evening Party Preparatory Committee Saves Two Million Yuan in Refreshment Costs, Donates to the Front Lines
	[Our Newspaper] The Union Medical College, received by the Central People's Government Ministry of Health on the 20th of this month, held a grand evening party at 7 pm on the 27th to celebrate its new life. At the meeting, Chairman Mr. Nie Yuchan (Principal of the affiliated Nursing School of the college) excitedly pointed out in his opening speech that due to the great victory of the Chinese people, Union Medical College has also been completely liberated. Such a thing would have been absolutely impossible during the rule of the Kuomintang traitorous government. She stated that under the leadership of the government, they will certainly strive to complete the tasks assigned by higher authorities. Representatives from the Central Ministry of Health, medical trade unions of various national universities, Chinese hospitals and other units, as well as alumni of the college in Beijing, were invited to participate in the evening party, expressing warm congratulations and expectations for the new Union Medical College. In addition, alumni of the college in Beijing (including the nursing school), the Central Academy of Fine Arts, the Peking University Medical College, and the nineteen universities participating in the Higher Education Conference on Handling Foreign Subsidies convened by the Ministry of Education in Beijing, the Chinese Medical Association, the Chinese Nurses Association, the Lingnan University Medical College, and Union Medical College alumni from Guangzhou and Tianjin sent flags or telegrams to express their congratulations. During the meeting, Dean Li Zong'en and Professor Zhang Xijun conveyed the spirit of the Higher Education Conference on Handling Foreign Subsidies and situational reports, after which the entertainment began.
	[Another News] The Preparatory Committee of the National Union Medical College Celebration Evening Party, in response to the donation campaign to慰劳 (express sympathy and appreciation to) Chinese and Korean soldiers and to provide relief to the Korean people, which is currently underway in the capital, East China, Northeast and other regions, has decided to donate all of the RMB two million yuan prepared for refreshments for this evening party to the Beiping Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression for forwarding to Korea.
