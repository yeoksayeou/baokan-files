　　Beijing Public Enterprises
　　Complete Last Year's Production Tasks
    [Reported by Xinhua News Agency] According to Xinhua News Agency: Workers in Beijing's public factories and enterprises have victoriously completed their 1950 production tasks during the patriotic production emulation campaign. As of now, among the 31 larger public factories and enterprises in Beijing, 22 units have comprehensively or partially launched patriotic production emulation campaigns. Among them, the Shijingshan Power Plant, Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, Liulihe Cement Plant, Beijing Clothing Factory, Beijing Tram Company, Beijing Waterworks Company, Beijing Telecommunications Bureau, Changxindian Railway Factory, and North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory not only completed their production tasks ahead of schedule, fully or partially, but also improved their production levels.
    The power generation of the Shijingshan Power Plant reached the highest record since the plant was built by the end of last November. The plant added wealth to the country estimated at approximately 2.9 billion yuan throughout the year. The iron smelting department of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant completed its annual production task on December 7th of last year. The Liulihe Cement Plant also completed its annual production task ahead of schedule on November 24th of last year. The total cement production of the plant last year was equal to the total production volume from 1944 to 1948 during the period of Japanese and Kuomintang reactionary rule. The repair and manufacturing plant of the Beijing Tram Company completed its annual production task as early as the end of September last year. By the end of December, there were 15 crew teams in the company with more than 30,000 kilometers of safe driving.
    Workers in various public factories and enterprises in Beijing have demonstrated a high degree of production enthusiasm and creativity in the patriotic production emulation campaign, creating many new production records. Meng Zhaolian, a worker in the foundry workshop of the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory, increased his gear production from the originally planned 10 per day to 46. Wang Yunhui, a female apprentice in the lathe workshop of the plant, created a new record of 283 "guide wheels" per day, exceeding the production task by 150 percent. The Liu Dezhen production group, a model worker of Shijingshan, exceeded the production task every month. After the Changxindian Railway Factory implemented the "three-shift continuous operation method" and work specialization, the foundry workshop of the factory was changed from one large shift to three shifts of molding, washing casting, and shaking sand, and the output has increased by 35 percent.

　　京市公营企业
　　完成去年生产任务
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：北京市公营工厂、企业职工在爱国主义生产竞赛运动中，已胜利完成一九五○年的生产任务。截至目前为止，京市三十一个较大的公营工厂、企业中，有二十二个单位全面或局部地开展了爱国主义生产竞赛。其中石景山发电厂、石景山钢铁厂、琉璃河水泥厂、北京被服厂、北京电车公司、北京自来水公司、北京电信局、长辛店铁路工厂、华北农业机械总厂等单位不仅全部或部分提前完成了生产任务，而且提高了生产水平。
    石景山发电厂发电量到去年十一月底已达到建厂以来的最高纪录。该厂全年给国家增加的财富约计二十九亿元。石景山钢铁厂炼铁部在去年十二月七日就完成了全年的生产任务。琉璃河水泥厂也于去年十一月二十四日提前完成了全年的生产任务。该厂去年水泥的总产量，等于日寇和国民党反动统治时期一九四四年到一九四八年间生产量的总合。北京电车公司的修造厂更在去年九月底即提前完成了全年的生产任务。到十二月底止，该公司安全行车超过三万公里的有十五个乘务小组。
    北京市各公营工厂企业工人在爱国主义生产竞赛中发挥了高度的生产积极性和创造性，创造了许多生产的新纪录。华北农业机械总厂铸工场工人孟昭连做齿轮，由原订每日十个提高到四十六个。该厂车工场女工徒王云慧做“车导轮”曾创造每日二百八十三个的新纪录，超过生产任务百分之一百五十。石景山劳动模范刘德珍生产小组每月都超额完成生产任务。长辛店铁路工厂实行“三班流水作业法”和工作专业化后，该厂铸工场由一大班改为作型、洗铸、打箱摇砂三班，产量已增加百分之三十五。
