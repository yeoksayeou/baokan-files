The Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government announces the
    Measures for the Repayment of Principal and Interest on the People's Victory Indexed Bonds:
    (1) In accordance with Article 5 of the Regulations on the People's Victory Indexed Bonds, the principal of these bonds will be repaid in five annual installments from 1951 to 1955. A lottery will be held each year to determine the bonds to be repaid. The lottery will be held in Beijing on February 1st of each year, with the supervision of representatives from all sectors, and will be conducted using the last two digits of the bond numbers.
    (2) The People's Bank of China is entrusted to handle the repayment of principal and interest of these bonds. The winning bonds shall be determined according to the numbers announced by the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government for each lottery.
    (3) From 1951 to 1955, the period for redeeming principal and interest will be from March 31st to September 30th each year. The People's Bank of China in various localities will verify and redeem the bonds. Any principal and interest due but not collected during this period may be collected during the next redemption period, up to September 30, 1955. To protect the rights and interests of bondholders, the redemption period for any outstanding principal and interest will be extended for another six months (i.e., until March 31, 1956). If they are not collected by then, the claim will expire and will no longer be redeemed.
    (4) Interest on the winning bonds will cease to accrue from the day following the date of repayment of principal and interest (i.e., March 31st) of the current year.
    (5) Bondholders may present their bonds to the People's Bank of China in various localities to collect the principal and interest due. If the current interest coupon is missing from the redeemed bond, no interest will be paid. If the next interest coupon is missing, the amount of missing interest will be deducted from the principal to be repaid. The bank will issue a certificate of deduction for the missing interest coupon, which can later be presented to the bank together with the missing interest coupon to verify and refund the deducted amount.
    (6) All interest due on these bonds shall be redeemed with the interest coupons attached to the bonds. However, the entire sheet of bonds must be submitted to the bank for verification and redemption. Bondholders shall not cut the coupons themselves.
    (7) With the exception of bonds issued in Xinjiang Province, bonds issued in other provinces within the customs area can be redeemed at the local People's Bank of China, regardless of the region of issuance. All payments will be made in Renminbi at the exchange rate announced by the Head Office of the People's Bank of China.
    (8) Bonds issued and redeemed in Xinjiang Province will be paid in Xinjiang currency at the exchange rate announced by the People's Bank of Xinjiang Province.
    (9) For the convenience of holders of bonds issued in Xinjiang Province who wish to redeem them in the customs area and the Northeast provinces, the People's Bank of China in the customs area and the Northeast Bank are designated as transfer banks, and the People's Bank of China in Lanzhou, Xi'an, Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and the joint office of the People's Bank of China in Shanhaiguan and the Northeast Bank are designated as paying banks. Redemption method: Payment will be made in local currency (Renminbi, Northeast currency) at the exchange rate between Xinjiang currency and the local currency, based on the Xinjiang exchange rate. The paying banks may make immediate payments upon presentation of the bonds. The transfer banks shall issue a receipt upon receiving the bonds and immediately forward them to the paying banks for verification. After verification, the principal and interest due will be remitted to the transfer banks for payment to the bondholders upon presentation of the receipt. For bonds issued in the customs area and brought to Xinjiang and the Northeast provinces, the People's Bank of China in Dihua and the joint office of the People's Bank of China in Shanhaiguan and the Northeast Bank are designated as paying banks. Payment will be made in local currency (Xinjiang currency, Northeast currency) at the exchange rate between Renminbi and the local currency, based on the exchange rate announced by the Head Office of the People's Bank of China. The People's Bank of China in various localities within Xinjiang Province and the Northeast Bank in various localities within the Northeast provinces are designated as transfer banks, and their transfer methods are the same as above.
    (10) The transfer and payment of principal and interest on these bonds shall be exempt from postage and remittance fees. However, if the bondholder requests telegraphic transfer, the telegraph fee shall be borne by the bondholder.
    (11) The repayment of principal and interest on these bonds shall be made upon presentation of the bonds, and no replacement will be issued for lost bonds.
    (12) Interest income from these bonds is exempt from income tax.
    Explanation:
    1. As stipulated in the regulations on these bonds, a lottery will be held annually from 1951 to 1955 to repay the principal in five installments. The amount of each lottery is calculated as a percentage of the bond amount. Therefore, the lottery numbers are also prepared as a percentage, with one hundred lottery sticks. Each stick is engraved with the last two digits of the number printed on the bond. That is, in every one hundred bonds, the last two digits of the numbers range from 01 to 00. In other words, within every one hundred consecutive bond numbers, there is one bond with each of the last two digits from 01 to 00. This is the rule for calculating percentages. Therefore, each stick drawn represents one percent of all types of bonds. Regardless of whether the bond is one cent, ten cents, one hundred cents, or five hundred cents, as long as the last two digits of the number on the bond are the same as the two digits on the drawn stick, it is a winning bond to be repaid. Calculating by the bond amount, drawing one stick represents one percent of the principal to be repaid.
    2. The one hundred sticks mentioned in the previous article are arranged in ten "lottery cylinders" in the order of their numbers during the lottery: "01" to "10" are placed in the first cylinder, "11" to "20" are placed in the second cylinder, and so on until "91" to "00" are placed in the tenth cylinder. If 10 percent of the principal is to be repaid, one stick is drawn from each cylinder. If 20 percent of the principal is to be repaid, two sticks are drawn from each cylinder. The numbers on the drawn sticks represent the numbers of the winning bonds, and so on.
    3. If the repayment is 15 percent or 25 percent, the lottery method is to first draw five "cylinder number sticks" to determine the cylinder for which an additional stick will be drawn. These "cylinder number sticks" are ten in number, engraved with "First Cylinder" to "Tenth Cylinder." Before the lottery, the ten cylinder number sticks are placed in a "cylinder number cylinder." Five sticks are drawn. For example, the five "cylinder number sticks" drawn before the second lottery for these bonds are "First Cylinder," "Third Cylinder," "Fifth Cylinder," "Seventh Cylinder," and "Ninth Cylinder." During the lottery, two sticks are drawn from each of the five cylinders: 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9, and one stick is drawn from each of the remaining five cylinders: 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10, for a total of fifteen sticks.
    4. For the fourth repayment of these bonds, twenty-five sticks should be drawn from the remaining fifty-five sticks. This means that there are six sticks in each of five cylinders and five sticks in each of five cylinders. To ensure a reasonable distribution, three sticks are drawn from each cylinder with six sticks, and two sticks are drawn from each cylinder with five sticks, for a total of twenty-five sticks. As a result of the drawing, each cylinder is left with three sticks, for a total of thirty sticks, which is exactly 30 percent for the fifth repayment.
    5. The drawn sticks with the winning numbers will be sealed on the spot and kept by the Head Office of the People's Bank of China.
    6. The winning numbers for each repayment will be reported on the spot during the lottery and will be subject to the winning numbers announced by the Central Ministry of Finance.
    7. To allow ample time for the transmission of the winning numbers, so that bondholders in various towns, villages, and overseas Chinese communities can redeem their principal and interest in a timely manner, the lottery time for each repayment has been advanced to February 1st of each year.

    （十二）本期公债免征利息所得税。
    说明：
    一、本公债条例规定自一九五一年起至一九五五年止，每年抽签还本一次，分五次偿还，每次抽还数目是按债额的百分数计算的，故抽签号码亦按百分比置备号签一百枝，每一枝签上采用债券上所印号码的最后两位数字，即每一百张的号码末二字都是自○一至○○止，也就是每一百张相联号码的债券内都有末二字自○一至○○的各一张，有百分比上这一百个两位号码就能代表各类债券的全部号码，这是计算百分比的规律，因此每抽出一枝签，就是代表各类债券的百分之一，不论债券是一分，是十分是一百分是五百分，只要债券上号码的最后两位数字与抽出签上两个数字的号码是相同的，都是中签还本的债券，以债额来核计抽中一枝签就是代表着应还的百分之一的本金。
    二、前条所说的一百枝签，在抽签时是按照号码的先后，顺序分装在十个“签筒”内：“○一”至“一○”装在第一筒内，“一一”至“二○”装在第二筒内，照此顺序直至“九一”至“○○”装在第十筒为止，如抽还本金百分之十就是每筒内抽签一枝，还本百分之二十就在每筒内抽签二枝，所抽出签上的号码就是代表中签债券的号码，余类推。
    三、如遇还本是百分之十五或百分之二十五时，其抽签法，先抽“筒号签”五枝，以决定加抽一签的筒次，这“筒号签”是十枝，上刻着“第一筒”以至“第十筒”，在抽签前先将筒号签十枝，装在一个“筒号筒”内，抽出五枝，例如本公债第二次抽签前抽出的五枝“筒号签”是“第一筒”“第三筒”“第五筒”“第七筒”“第九筒”，抽签时就在一、三、五、七、九五个筒内各抽二枝，其余二、四、六、八、十五个筒内各抽一签，共计十五枝。
    四、本公债第四次还本应从余签五十五枝内抽二十五枝，计有五个签筒内各六枝，五个签筒内各五枝，为使分配合理，六枝签筒各抽三枝、五枝签筒各抽二枝，计共二十五枝，抽余结果，每筒各剩三枝，计共三十枝，恰为第五次还本之百分之三十。
    五、每次抽出中签号码的签枝，均当场签封，由中国人民银行总行保存。
    六、每次还本中签号码，除在抽签时当场报告外，统以中央财政部公布的中签号码为准。
    七、为从容传达中签号码，使各城镇乡村及海外侨胞债券持有人均可及时持券兑付本息起见，特将每次还本抽签时间，提前于每年二月一日举行。（附图表）
