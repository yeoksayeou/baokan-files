　　Introduction to Seoul
    Seoul is the capital stipulated in the Constitution of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Seoul is located in the center of the Korean Peninsula, with a population of approximately 1.5 million, and is rich in local products. Railroads and highways starting from Seoul run throughout the country. The area from Yeongdeungpo to Incheon, west of Seoul, is a well-known industrial area in southern Korea.
    Seoul is an ancient capital with a long history in Korea, and it had long been the political, economic, and cultural center of Korea since 1395.
    In 1910, Japanese imperialism annexed Korea and established the Governor-General's Office in Seoul as a command post for exploiting and enslaving the Korean people. In August 1945, the great Soviet army liberated Korea. However, on September 9 of the same year, the U.S. troops entering Seoul suppressed the democratic regime of the Korean people and supported the extremely reactionary and corrupt Syngman Rhee regime. Under the rule of Japan and the United States, Seoul spent forty years of humiliation.
    Under the direct instigation of U.S. imperialism, the Syngman Rhee gang launched a civil war on June 25 last year. The heroic Korean People's Army, after crushing the sudden invasion of the Syngman Rhee puppet army, quickly turned to the counter-offensive and liberated Seoul in one fell swoop on June 28. However, on September 15 last year, the U.S. aggressors, in an attempt to save their fate of failure in the war of aggression against Korea, landed in Incheon with twenty times the strength of the Korean People's Army and invaded Seoul. The people of Seoul, regardless of the U.S. planes' frantic bombing, bravely launched the Seoul Defense War. Among the 1.5 million residents, 500,000 people voluntarily participated in building fortifications, supporting the front lines, and participating in combat, giving the U.S. invaders a heavy blow. The U.S. invading army spent half a month and paid a heavy price of 14,000 casualties before re-occupying Seoul on September 30.
    After Seoul temporarily fell, the U.S.-Rhee gang implemented a bloody reign of terror there. Hundreds and thousands of Korean people were collectively slaughtered. However, blood could not extinguish the people's angry flames of revenge, and the heroic and unyielding people never stopped their struggle of resistance. The people of Seoul constantly sniped at the American bandits and the Rhee traitorous bandits. Slogans and leaflets calling for resistance against U.S. imperialist aggression constantly appeared in many places in the city.
    After enduring three months of darkness, the heroic and unyielding Seoul was finally liberated again and returned to the hands of the Korean people under the joint counter-offensive of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers. Now, the beautiful tricolor flag is flying again over the free sky of Seoul.

　　汉城介绍
    汉城是朝鲜民主主义人民共和国宪法所规定的首都。汉城位于朝鲜半岛的中央，人口约一百五十万，附近物产丰富。从汉城出发的铁路、公路网贯通全国。汉城以西的永登浦到仁川一带，是朝鲜南部著名的工业地区。
    汉城是朝鲜历史悠久的古都，自一三九五年起曾长期是朝鲜的政治、经济、文化中心。
    一九一○年，日本帝国主义并吞朝鲜，在汉城设总督府，作为剥削和奴役朝鲜人民的指挥所。一九四五年八月，伟大的苏军解放了朝鲜。但同年九月九日，进入汉城的美军，一面镇压朝鲜人民的民主政权，一面就扶植极端反动而腐败的李承晚政权。在日本与美国的统治下，汉城度过了四十年的屈辱生活。
    在美帝国主义的直接指使下，李承晚匪帮于去年六月二十五日发动了内战。英勇的朝鲜人民军在粉碎了李承晚伪军的突然进犯后，迅速地转入反攻，并于六月二十八日一举解放了汉城。但在去年九月十五日，美国侵略者妄图挽救其侵朝战争失败的命运，以二十倍于朝鲜人民军的兵力在仁川登陆，进犯汉城。汉城人民即不顾美机的疯狂滥炸，英勇地展开汉城保卫战。在一百五十万居民中，就有五十万人自动参加构筑防御工事，支援前线和参加作战，予美国进犯者以沉重打击。美国侵略军花了半个月时间，付出了伤亡一万四千人的惨重代价后，才于九月三十日重行侵占汉城。
    汉城暂时沦陷后，美李匪帮在那里实行了血腥恐怖统治。成百成千的朝鲜人民被集体屠杀。但是，鲜血浇不灭人民愤怒的复仇火焰，英勇不屈的人民没有一天停止过反抗斗争。汉城人民不时狙击美国强盗和李匪卖国贼。城内许多地方都不断出现号召反抗美帝国主义侵略的标语和传单。
    英勇不屈的汉城在度过三个月的黑夜后，终于又在朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军的联合大反攻下，获得解放，重归朝鲜人民手中。现在，美丽的三色旗，又重新飘扬在自由汉城的上空了。
