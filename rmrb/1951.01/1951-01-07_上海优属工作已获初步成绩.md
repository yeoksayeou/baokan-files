Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 4th: The Shanghai Municipal People's Government has made preliminary achievements in its work of providing preferential treatment to the families of revolutionary martyrs, revolutionary soldiers, and working cadres. After the liberation of Shanghai, the Municipal People's Government began registering and investigating the families of martyrs, servicemen, and workers throughout the city. It universally visited and offered condolences to the known families of martyrs and servicemen, and successively established groups for families of martyrs, servicemen, and workers in most districts. Under the circumstances of national financial and economic difficulties, the People's Government, in addition to providing appropriate relief or pensions to poor families of martyrs, servicemen, and workers, also used various methods to organize them to participate in production, introduce them to occupations, and help them solve their living difficulties. Over the past year, the People's Government has helped poor servicemen's families in the city establish five servicemen's mutual aid service cooperatives, three supply and marketing points for practical goods for families of martyrs, servicemen, and workers, a servicemen's joint cotton weaving factory, a cinder production and sales cooperative, and one hundred and fifty-eight bicycle parking stations. Many administrative organs and public and private enterprises give priority to employing unemployed families of martyrs, servicemen, and workers under the same employment conditions. Currently, more than 1,300 families of martyrs, servicemen, and workers in the city have participated in production or obtained employment through introductions. The People's Government has also been providing monthly living allowances to families of martyrs and servicemen who are unable to engage in production. In the urban area alone, families of martyrs and servicemen received a total of approximately 450 million yuan in relief funds from January to the end of November last year. In addition, poor families of martyrs, servicemen, and workers have also received preferential treatment in terms of medical treatment and schooling through introductions from the People's Government. In addition to providing material preferential treatment to families of martyrs, servicemen, and workers, the Shanghai Municipal People's Government also pays attention to raising their political status. When Shanghai held its second first People's Representative Conference last year, representatives of families of martyrs, servicemen, and honorary soldiers were invited to participate, thereby generally raising their political status.

　　上海优属工作已获初步成绩
    【新华社上海四日电】上海市人民政府优待革命烈士、革命军人和工作干部家属的工作，已做出初步的成绩。上海解放后，该市人民政府就开始登记与调查全市的烈属、军属和工属，对已知烈属、军属普遍地进行了拜访和慰问，并在大多数区内先后建立了烈属、军属和工属的小组。在国家财政经济困难的情况下，人民政府对贫苦的烈属、军属、工属除了适当地进行救济或抚恤外，并用各种方法组织他们参加生产，给他们介绍职业，帮助他们解决生活困难。一年多以来，人民政府已帮助全市贫苦军属建立了五个军属互助服务社，三个烈、军、工属实用物品供销处，一个军属联合棉织工厂，一个煤渣生产供销社，和一百五十八个脚踏车停放站。许多行政机关和公私企业部门都在同等录用条件下，优先录用失业的烈属、军属和工属。现全市烈属、军属、工属已经参加生产和经过介绍获得职业者已有一千三百余人。人民政府对于无力生产的烈属、军属，也已按月发给生活补助费。仅市区内的烈属、军属，在去年一月至十一月底，总共得到了约四亿五千万元的救济金。此外，贫苦烈属、军属和工属在治病、求学等方面，经由人民政府介绍，也都受到了优待。上海市人民政府对烈属、军属、工属除进行物质的优待外，还注意提高他们的政治地位。去年上海市举行第二届第一次人民代表会议时，曾邀请烈属、军属及荣誉军人的代表参加，因而普遍提高了他们的政治地位。
