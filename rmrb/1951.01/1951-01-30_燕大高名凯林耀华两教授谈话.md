Yanjing University Professors Gao Mingkai and Lin Yaohua Speak

[Reported by this newspaper] Professors Gao Mingkai, Head of the Chinese Department, and Lin Yaohua, Head of the Sociology Department of Yanjing University, issued written statements opposing the U.S. imperialist plot for a separate peace treaty with Japan. Professor Gao Mingkai stated: "U.S. imperialism has consistently obstructed negotiations for a peace treaty with Japan. After its defeat in the war of aggression against Korea, it suddenly dispatched the Dulles mission to Japan to carry out a separate peace treaty scheme. This is not only a violation of international agreements but also a conspiracy to rearm Japan and drive Japan to threaten China's security and peace in East Asia. We should stand with peace-loving people all over the world to resolutely oppose this move by U.S. imperialism. We believe that the people of Japan will also rise up and refuse to be cannon fodder for U.S. imperialism." Professor Lin Yaohua stated: "Truman's appointment of Dulles as a special representative to openly conduct activities for a unilateral peace treaty with Japan is a new conspiracy by U.S. imperialists to violate international faith and deliberately tear up international treaties such as the Potsdam Proclamation. It intends to obliterate the achievements of the great Chinese people in resisting the aggressive forces of Japanese imperialism for fifty years, and it also intends to obliterate the contributions made by the Soviet Union and the people of Asian countries in the struggle to overthrow Japanese imperialism. The U.S. imperialists are simultaneously fostering fascist forces in West Germany and Japan. This is something that peace-loving people who oppose fascism around the world (including the people of Japan, Germany, and the United States) can never tolerate."

　　燕大高名凯林耀华两教授谈话
    【本报讯】燕京大学国文系主任高名凯教授、社会系主任林耀华教授为反对美帝国主义单独对日媾和的阴谋，发表书面谈话。高名凯教授称：“美帝国主义一向阻挠对日媾和的谈判，而于侵朝战争失败之后，忽然派遣了杜勒斯代表团到日本去进行单独对日媾和的勾当。这不但是违反了国际协定，而且是重新武装日本、驱使日本来威胁中国安全和东亚和平的一个阴谋。我们应当和全世界爱好和平的人民站在一起来坚决反对美帝国主义这一举动。我们相信日本的人民也一定会起来拒绝给美帝国主义当炮灰。”林耀华教授称：“杜鲁门任命杜勒斯为特别代表，公开进行片面对日和约的活动，这是美帝国主义者违背国际信义，蓄意撕毁波茨坦公告等国际条约的新阴谋；它意图抹煞反抗日本帝国主义的侵略势力达五十年的伟大中国人民的功绩，也意图抹煞苏联及亚洲各国人民在打倒日本帝国主义的斗争中所作的贡献。美帝在西德及日本同时进行扶植法西斯势力，这是世界上爱好和平、反对法西斯主义的人民（包括日本、德国及美国的人民在内）所决不能容忍的事。
