　　American Reactionary Political Commentator Lippmann
    Admits the Power of Our People is Strong
    [Xinhua News Agency, January 14th] Due to the disastrous defeat of the United States on the Korean battlefield, even the reactionary American political commentator Lippmann has had to admit that the power of the Chinese people is unprecedentedly strong. According to a report from Teletype News Agency: On the 10th of this month, Lippmann wrote in the "New York Herald Tribune" admitting that "America's policy has fallen into a dead end." Lippmann wrote: "We have to admit that any issue within the scope of China's historical interests cannot be resolved without the participation of Red China. ... Therefore, if Red China is ignored, the Korean issue cannot be resolved no matter what or when. ... Now the facts have shown this on the battlefield." Lippmann warned the American ruling clique not to harbor any illusions that blockading or bombing China would have any results. He said: "China is too strong to be dealt with by force."
    On January 12th, Lippmann wrote in the same newspaper, demanding that the United States face up to the failure in Korea and withdraw American troops from Korea. He said: "On the Asian continent, the Chinese themselves – without the assistance of the Soviet air force and navy – are much stronger than our forces." Lippmann wrote fearfully: "If the war spreads to China, then the scale of the war will not be decided by Truman, but by China." Lippmann said: "We can still hope that our ability can do better than a child who has hit a few nails and throws a tantrum that doesn't help. If we do have this ability, we should not act as if we thought that a much larger war against China could somehow make the terrible little war in Korea better."

　　美反动政治评论家李普曼
    承认我人民力量强大
    【新华社十四日讯】由于美国在朝鲜战场上的惨败，连美国反动的政治评论家李普曼也已不得不承认中国人民力量已空前强大。据电通社消息：先在本月十日，李普曼即在“纽约先驱论坛报”上撰文承认“美国的政策已堕入死路”。李普曼写道：“我们不得不承认任何在中国历史利益范围之内的问题，如无红色中国参加，都不能解决。……因此，如果红色中国被忽视，朝鲜问题即无论如何，无论何时也不能得到解决。……现在事实已经表明在战场上了”。李普曼警告美国统治集团不要怀有任何幻想，以为封锁或轰炸中国会有任何结果。他说：“中国过于强大，不是以强力可以处置得了的”。
    本月十二日，李普曼又在同报撰文，要求美国正视在朝鲜的失败，并将美军撤出朝鲜。他说：“在亚洲大陆上，只是中国人自己——不要苏联空军和海军的援助，就比我们的力量强大得多”。李普曼恐惧地写道：“如果战争蔓延到中国，那么战争的规模就不是由杜鲁门来决定，而是由中国来决定了。”李普曼说：“我们仍然可以希望，我们的能力所能够做的事情比一个碰了好些钉子的小孩子大发一阵于事无补的脾气更好一些。如果我们确有这种能力，我们就不应作成那种样子，好像我们以为对中国进行规模大得多的战争，就多少可以使朝鲜这场糟糕的小战争变得好一点似的。”
