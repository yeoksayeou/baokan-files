　　Some Rural Opera Troupes in Zhengding County
    Should Not Force Villagers to Pay Grain and Money
    In Zhengding County, Hebei Province, during the development of cultural and recreational activities, many village opera troupes hired teachers and purchased costumes, repeatedly forcing villagers to pay grain and money, resulting in extravagance and waste, which made the vast majority of villagers very dissatisfied. For example, the Beijia Village Opera Troupe in the Third District used 300 jin of millet per month to hire a teacher to teach old operas. Last year, during the wheat harvest, they disregarded the lives and production of the villagers and once forced them to pay 1,860 jin of wheat. In June of the same year, village cadres took over 220 jin of rice earned by the villagers from digging the Zhouhan River and did not distribute it to them, but gave it to the opera troupe. At that time, Li Shutian, the civil affairs assistant of the district, was working in the village, and not only did he not stop it, but he also helped the village cadres to do so, which further fueled the extravagant and wasteful behavior of the opera troupe. Last autumn, the village opera troupe again forced the villagers to pay 15 million yuan, which was immediately stopped by the district head, who gave the opera troupe severe criticism and education. However, in December, the opera troupe secretly forced the villagers to pay another 6.8 million yuan. Recently, they also sent people to Beijing to buy costumes, spending more than 7 million yuan in RMB. They are also preparing to collect another sum of money to buy some costumes in Shijiazhuang. The village opera troupe has collected a total of 9,200 jin of millet worth of grain and money in three installments. They used the method of threatening the villagers to collect money. For example, the actor Wang Xiaohuo said, "If any family does not pay the money, bring them to the opera troupe." Therefore, the villagers of the village dare to be angry but dare not speak out against the bad behavior of the opera troupe. Similarly, the opera troupes in Nanbeibaidian and Quyangqiao villages in the Third District and Yong'an Village in the Second District also have similar phenomena. We hope that the relevant authorities will immediately correct these deviations.

    Editor's note: Rural cultural and recreational activities should be carried out on the principle of the masses' conscious and voluntary participation. It is completely wrong for the Beijia Village Opera Troupe in Zhengding, Hebei Province, to force the villagers to pay grain and money, be extravagant and wasteful, and disregard the interests of the vast majority of the masses. It is hoped that the Zhengding County People's Government of Hebei Province will conduct a thorough inspection and correct this bad practice.

　　正定县某些农村剧团
    不应向群众强派粮款
    河北正定县在开展文娱活动中，有许多村剧团雇教师、置行头，向群众多次派粮款，铺张浪费，使得广大群众非常不满。如三区北贾村剧团，每月用三百斤小米雇了一个教师，教旧剧。去年麦收时，他们不顾群众的生活与生产，曾一次向群众派小麦一千八百六十斤。同年六月间村干部又将群众挖周韩河挣的二百二十余斤米不分给群众，交给了剧团，当时该区民政助理员李书田同志住在该村工作，不但不加制止，反而帮助村干部这样做，更加助长了剧团铺张浪费的行为。去年秋季该村剧团又向群众派款一千五百万元，当时被区长发觉，立即制止了，并给了剧团严厉的批评和教育。但是十二月间，该剧团暗地又向群众派款六百八十余万元。最近并派人到北京买行头，用去人民币七百余万元，他们还准备再收一部分款，到石家庄买些行头。该村剧团三次共派粮款折小米九千二百余斤。他们是用威胁群众的方式收款的，如演员王小货说：“派款谁家不给，把他弄到剧团来。”因此，该村群众对剧团的恶劣行为是敢怒而不敢言。又如三区南北白店、曲阳桥村剧团，二区永安村，也有类似现象。我们希望有关机关立即纠正这些偏向。

    编者按：农村的文化娱乐运动，是在群众自觉自愿的原则下进行才对，像河北正定北贾村剧团这样向群众强派粮款，铺张浪费，不顾广大群众的利益，是完全错误的。望河北正定县人民政府切实进行检查，纠正这种恶劣作法。
