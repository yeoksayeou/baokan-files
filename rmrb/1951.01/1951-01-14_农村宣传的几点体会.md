Some Experiences in Rural Propaganda
　　Wang Changlong

    In order to understand the development of the Resist America and Aid Korea movement and the ideological situation of people from all walks of life, the Xinxiang Prefectural Committee of the Pingyuan Province organized an inspection team to conduct work in Dazhangzhai Administrative Village in the fifth district of Yuanyang. During the thirteen days of work, the inspection team conducted propaganda on Resist America and Aid Korea while understanding the ideological situation of people from all walks of life, and at the same time, helped the village with its central tasks. From the village's propaganda on Resist America and Aid Korea, we have the following experiences:

    (1) When the inspection team arrived in the village, it coincided with the village's autumn grain collection work, and the village cadres and the masses were busy collecting and handing in public grain. At this time, the inspection team, on the one hand, informed the village cadres to continue collecting public grain, and on the other hand, went to each household to talk to the masses individually about Resist America and Aid Korea. At this time, it was found that the masses' thoughts were concentrated on handing in public grain, and when you talked about current affairs, they would casually respond with a few words like "That's right, that's right." When you raised questions, they would say, "How would us villagers know about these things!" Some farmers asked, "How far is Korea from us?" After you explained the distance, they would say, "That's still far away!" After two days of this, it was felt that it would not be possible to understand the ideological emotions of people from all walks of life by continuing in this way. Therefore, it was decided to participate in the village's central work and conduct the collection work together with the village cadres. The village cadres expressed great welcome to this approach of the inspection team. The inspection team, with the content of collecting public grain and organizing winter production, held small-scale symposiums for production activists, symposiums for middle and poor peasants, symposiums for intellectuals in the village, and symposiums for women, etc. At these meetings, propaganda on Resist America and Aid Korea was also conducted. At the meetings, the farmers actively expressed their opinions on Resist America and Aid Korea and had lively discussions. As a result, the farmers consciously linked the work of collecting public grain, winter production, and strengthening public security with the Resist America and Aid Korea movement. After clearly understanding the purpose of Resist America and Aid Korea, everyone's enthusiasm was even higher, and the task of public grain was quickly completed. From this, we have learned that the propaganda work of Resist America and Aid Korea must be combined with the central work and the ideological requirements of the masses.

    (2) It is necessary to explain the principles of Resist America and Aid Korea systematically at the conference, but it must be explained in a very popular way. At the same time, in the conference, the masses cannot raise questions at any time, and after the speech, the farmers often forget their doubts. Therefore, after doing current affairs propaganda at the conference, it is necessary to hold small-scale symposiums for people from all walks of life so that current affairs propaganda can be widely and deeply rooted.

    (3) Before the farmers understand the principles of Resist America and Aid Korea, their thinking is numb; but after understanding, they are very prone to panic, and even affect production. This point must be noted and well grasped. Our experience is: After the farmers know the current atrocities of the American imperialists in Korea, they can easily think of their own tragic lives during the Japanese invasion of China, and the crimes of the landlords and Chiang Kai-shek's special agents. At this time, it is necessary to guide everyone to fully accuse them. Only through full accusation can the farmers' hatred be turned into strength and actively take action. The old man Yuan Yongtong once said, "I will have difficulty eating and drinking after I pay the public grain!" before he understood the principles of Resist America and Aid Korea. But after recalling and complaining, he actively paid the grain and voluntarily paid thirty-one catties of grain more. He said to others, "If we don't resist America and aid Korea, can we still protect our current lives! As long as I am frugal, the grain is enough to eat until the wheat harvest next year. Moreover, I still have to produce in these few months!"

    (4) In rural areas, the most lacking is the organizational structure of current affairs propaganda, especially in the new district. In the past, we did not do enough to publicize current affairs to the farmers, and coupled with the farmers' simple thinking, it is even more necessary to establish a regular propaganda organization. At the same time, current affairs propaganda should not be regarded as a rush job. Although after a concentrated propaganda, it can arouse the farmers' concern for current affairs, it is precisely because the farmers are concerned about current affairs that it is even more necessary to establish a propaganda organization. For example, after we promoted current affairs in Dazhangzhai Village, the farmers kept coming to us and asked us to read the newspaper for them. Before this, the newspaper ordered by the village office was never read, and it was often kept intact in the village head's house. In order to enable everyone to know current affairs regularly, at the request of cadres and the masses, we helped them organize a Propaganda and Liaison Association. The Propaganda and Liaison Association will lead winter schools, reading newspapers, broadcasting, blackboard newspapers, and theater troupes, etc., and conduct regular current affairs propaganda through these activities. The members of the Propaganda and Liaison Association are: three village cadres, voluntary teachers of the winter school, the principal of the complete primary school, and three intellectuals in the village. And according to the specialties of each person, the division of labor was carried out. After the Propaganda and Liaison Association was established, the winter school started quickly. The members of the Propaganda and Liaison Association also had great enthusiasm. Every village can find people who are enthusiastic about propaganda, as long as someone organizes and leads them regularly. In the past, the Propaganda and Liaison Association composed of village cadres concurrently, because the village cadres were very busy and part-time, it was easy to become a formality.

　　农村宣传的几点体会
    王昌隆
    平原省新乡地委为了了解抗美援朝运动的开展情况，以及各阶层人民的思想情况，曾组织了检查组，到原阳五区的大张寨行政村进行工作。在十三天的工作中，检查组一方面在了解各阶层的思想情况中，进行了对抗美援朝的宣传，同时，帮助村里做了中心工作。从这个村对抗美援朝的宣传中，我们有这样的体会：
    （一）检查组一到村，适值村里进行秋征工作，村干部和群众都忙于收缴公粮。这时，检查组一面告知村干部继续征收公粮，一面到各户向群众个别谈论抗美援朝的事。这时发现群众的思想都集中在缴公粮上，你讲时事，他就随便应付你几句“就是，就是”。你提出问题，他就说：“乡下人那里知道这些事！”有的农民问：“朝鲜离咱这里有多远？”你讲清了距离，他就说：“那还远哩！”这样过了两天，觉得这样下去是不能了解各阶层人民的思想情绪的，便确定参加村的中心工作，和村干部一块进行征收工作。村干部对检查组这种作法极表欢迎。检查组以征收公粮和组织冬季生产为内容，召开了小型的生产积极分子座谈会、中贫农座谈会、在乡知识分子座谈会、妇女座谈会等。在这些会议上，同时进行了关于抗美援朝的宣传。会上，农民们都积极发表了对抗美援朝的意见，并热烈进行了讨论。这一来，农民们自觉地把征收公粮、冬季生产、加强治安等工作和抗美援朝运动联系起来了。在明确认识了抗美援朝的目的以后，大家的积极性更高了，公粮任务得以迅速完成。从这里我们体会到，抗美援朝的宣传工作，一定要结合中心工作、结合群众的思想要求来进行。
    （二）在大会上有系统地讲解抗美援朝的道理，是需要的，但必须讲得很通俗才行。同时，在大会上讲解，群众不能随时提出问题质疑，讲完之后，农民又往往把疑问忘了。所以，在大会上做时事宣传之后，必须再召开各阶层的小型座谈会，这样才会使时事宣传广泛深入。
    （三）在农民不了解抗美援朝的道理之前，思想上是麻痹的；但在了解之后，又极容易恐慌起来，乃至使生产受到影响。这一点必须注意并很好地加以掌握。我们的体会是：农民知道了目前美帝在朝鲜的暴行后，很容易联想起日寇侵略我国时自己的悲惨生活，想起地主和蒋匪特务的罪行。这时，就要很好地引导大家尽情控诉。只有经过尽情控诉，才能使农民的仇恨变为力量，积极行动起来。老人袁永同在不明白抗美援朝的道理之前，曾说：“我缴了公粮，吃喝就困难了！”但经过回忆、诉苦之后，他积极缴粮，并自愿多缴了三十一斤谷子。他对人说：“不抗美援朝，咱现在的生活还能保得住吗！只要我节俭些，粮食满够吃到明年麦收。况且这几个月里我还要生产哩！”
    （四）在农村中，最感缺乏的是时事宣传的组织机构，特别是在新区。过去，我们对农民宣传时事不够，再加上农民思想单纯，更需设立经常的宣传组织机构。同时，时事宣传不应该当做突击工作来看。虽然经过突击性的宣传，能引起农民对时事的关心，也正因为农民对时事关心了，建立宣传组织机构更为必要。如我们在大张寨村宣传时事后，农民就不断找来叫我们给读报纸。在这以前，村公所订的报纸，却是从没人看，常常原封不动地放在村长家里。为了使大家能经常知道时事，在干部和群众的要求下，我们帮助他们组织了一个宣联会。由宣联会来领导冬学、读报、广播、黑板报、剧团等，通过这些活动，进行经常的时事宣传。宣联会的组成人员是：村干部三人，冬学义务教员，完全小学校长和三个在乡知识分子。并根据各人的特长进行了分工。宣联会成立后，冬学很快开了课。宣联会的委员们劲头也很大。每个村都可以找到热心于宣传事业的人，只要有人来组织和经常领导就行。过去以村干部兼职组成的宣联会，因为村干部很忙，又是兼职，很容易流于形式。
