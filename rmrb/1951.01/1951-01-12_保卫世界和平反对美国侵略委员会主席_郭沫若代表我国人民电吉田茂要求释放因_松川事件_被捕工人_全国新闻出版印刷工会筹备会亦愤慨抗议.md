　　Chairman Guo Moruo of the China Peace Committee and Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea
    Cables Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida on Behalf of the Chinese People Demanding the Release of Workers Arrested in the "Matsukawa Incident";
    Preparatory Committee of the National Union of News, Publishing and Printing Workers Also Protests Angrily
    [By Our Staff Reporter] Guo Moruo, Chairman of the China Peace Committee and Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea, sent a cable to Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida, protesting the persecution of Japanese patriotic workers under the pretext of the "Matsukawa Incident" and demanding the immediate release of those arrested. The cable reads as follows:
To Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida, Tokyo:
    We, on behalf of the Chinese people, strongly protest your unreasonable sentencing, under the instigation of American imperialism, of Suzuki Nobu, chairman of the Fukushima branch of the Japan National Railway Workers' Union, and other workers defending peace, to death, life imprisonment, and fixed-term imprisonment respectively, under the pretext of the Matsukawa train derailment incident, and demand that you immediately and unconditionally release them.
    Chairman Guo Moruo, China Peace Committee and Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea
                                          January 10, 1951
    [By Our Staff Reporter] The Preparatory Committee of the National Union of News, Publishing and Printing Workers recently issued a statement regarding the illegal judgment of the Japanese reactionary government on the so-called "Matsukawa Incident." The statement stated that after the failure of the American imperialist war of aggression against Korea, in order to strengthen its rule over the Japanese people, it directed the reactionary Yoshida government to fabricate the "Matsukawa train derailment incident" and unreasonably sentenced twenty Japanese Communist Party members and patriotic workers to heavy sentences. All Chinese news, publishing, and printing workers express extreme indignation at this brutal crime committed by American imperialism and the Japanese reactionary government. We firmly oppose the illegal judgment of the reactionary Yoshida government and demand the immediate and unconditional release of innocent detainees.

    我们代表中国人民严重地抗议你们在美帝国主义指使下，以松川列车颠覆事件为借口，无理地将日本国营铁路工会福岛分会委员长铃木信等保卫和平的工人分别判处死刑、无期徒刑和有期徒刑，并要求你们立即将他们无条件释放。

    【本报讯】全国新闻出版印刷工会筹备会顷对日本反动政府对所谓“松川事件”的非法判决发表声明。声明略称，美帝侵朝战争失败之后，为加强对日本人民的统治，指使吉田反动政府，捏造“松川列车颠覆事件”，无理判决二十名日本共产党员和爱国工人的重刑。中国新闻出版印刷全体职工，对美帝国主义及日本反动政府这一残暴的罪行，极表愤慨。我们坚决反对吉田反动政府的非法判决，要求立即无条件释放无辜被捕者。
