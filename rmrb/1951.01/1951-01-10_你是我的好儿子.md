　　You Are My Good Son
    Fei Jieyi
    (Editor's Note: This poem was written by Fei Jieyi, a Chinese teacher at Beijing Municipal Fifth Middle School, when he signed up his young son, Fei Shiyu, to attend a military cadre school, and is also dedicated to the students of Fifth Middle School. The author personally recited it at a school-wide assembly of teachers and students, greatly encouraging the students.)
　　From today on, you are no longer just my son, you will be the son of all the Chinese people, and the beloved motherland is your mother. Hundreds of millions of people are protecting you. Son, you must dedicate everything—wisdom, energy, even life—to your great mother. Advance bravely!
　　From today on, you are no longer just my son, you will be the son of all the people of the world. Hundreds of millions of people are defending you. Our happy lives must be defended, the fire of the invaders must be extinguished! Fight, go and drive back the man-eating savages!
　　From today on, I am no longer a fifty-year-old man, my heart will always be as young and strong as yours. I will also dedicate everything—wisdom, energy, even life—to fight to the end for peace and a better life!
　　From today on, you are at the front, and I am in the rear. Even if we are thousands of miles apart, our beliefs will unite us. If you are a good child, and want to give me the greatest comfort, then you must devote yourself to the heroic struggle!
　　Thinking back to the eighteen years you have been by my side, when you go to sleep, when you wake up, when you go to school, when you come home, when you are sick, I am always thinking of you, I am always worried about you. But today, you are running to the sky, to the sea, thousands of miles away… I am smiling with relief. Because before my eyes, there is a strong and heroic figure.
　　“Raise children to provide for old age, save grain to guard against famine.” But from today on, I have broken down this idea. I know you understand it more thoroughly than I do. I have rejuvenated, becoming younger and stronger day by day. Son, you have brought youth to your father!
　　From today on, you are even more my good son, you have raised the red flag of Mao Zedong, you are a soldier of Mao Zedong. In the bugle call of the motherland, you stand up heroically, advance, advance, towards victory! I am full of hope in blessing you, when that day you return in triumph, we will be even more joyful!

　　你是我的好儿子
    费介贻
    （编者按：这首诗是北京市立第五中学国文教师费介贻，为其幼子费时雨报名参加军事干部学校写的，并兼以献给五中同学。作者曾在全校师生大会上亲自朗诵，给同学们很大鼓励。）从今天起，你不再是我一个人的儿子了，你将是全中国人民的儿子，亲爱的祖国就是你的母亲。千千万万人民护卫着你，儿子啊，你要贡献出一切——智慧，精力，甚至生命，为你伟大的母亲，你勇敢前进吧！从今天起，你不再是我一个人的儿子了，你将是全世界人民的儿子，万万千千人民卫护着你，我们的幸福的生活必须保卫，侵略者的火呀，必须扑灭它！你战斗吧，去把吃人的生番打退！从今天起，我不再是一个五十岁的人了，我的心永远和你的一样，年青而坚强。我也要贡献出我的一切，——智慧，精力，甚至生命，为了和平，为了美好的生活，战斗到底！从今天起，你在前线，我在后方，即使相隔万里，信念却将我们联在一起。你如果是个好孩子，要想给我最大的安慰，那你只有投身到英勇的斗争中去！回想起你在十八年里，你一直依傍着我，当你临睡，当你睡醒，当你上学，当你回家，当你在生病的时候，我总是惦记着你，我总是为你操心。但是今天，你跑到千里万里外的天空中，海洋上……我反而安心地微笑了。因为在我眼前，出现着一个矫健而英勇的身影。“养儿防老，积谷防饥。”但是从今天起，我已经打垮了这个念头。我知道你比我了解得更彻底。我已经返老还童，一天比一天年轻，一天比一天健壮，儿子啊，你给父亲带来了青春！从今天起，你更是我的好儿子了，你举起了毛泽东的红旗，你是毛泽东的战士。在祖国的号角声中，你英勇地站起来，前进，前进，向着胜利！我满怀希望在祝福你，当那一天你凯旋回来，我们将更加欢喜！
