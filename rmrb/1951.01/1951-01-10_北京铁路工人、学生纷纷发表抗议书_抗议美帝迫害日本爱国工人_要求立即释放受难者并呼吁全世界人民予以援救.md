    Beijing Railway Workers and Students Issue Protest Letters
    Protesting American Imperialism's Persecution of Patriotic Japanese Workers
    Demanding Immediate Release of Victims, and Calling on People Worldwide to Offer Assistance
    [This newspaper reports] Beijing railway workers and students have issued protest letters, angrily protesting the "Matsukawa Incident" fabricated by American and Japanese reactionaries to persecute Japanese Communist Party members and patriotic workers, demanding the immediate unconditional release of the victims, and calling on people worldwide to offer assistance.
    The National Committee of the Railway Trade Union, the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions, the Beijing Branch Committee of the Railway Trade Union, and the Railway Trade Union Committee of the Ministry of Railways have all issued protest letters. The protest letter from the National Committee of the Railway Trade Union stated: "This shameless act by the American and Japanese reactionaries is intolerable to the working class worldwide. The interests of the working class worldwide are consistent, and the fate of Japanese workers is especially closely related to that of the Chinese working class. We feel the barbaric persecution suffered by our Japanese worker brothers as if it were our own. We protest this cruel atrocity by the American and Japanese reactionaries and demand their immediate release." The protest letter called on railway workers nationwide to step up production and take practical action to protest the crimes of the American and Japanese reactionaries and support the struggle of their Japanese brothers.
    National Railway Labor Model Li Yonglu, in his protest letter, angrily protested the atrocities of the American and Japanese reactionaries and demanded the immediate release of the twenty patriotic railway workers. Recalling the situation during the "February 7th" strike, Li Yonglu said: "During the 'February 7th' strike, we don't know how many railway workers were imprisoned... Now that the Japanese working class is suffering this kind of oppression, we are very sympathetic." Li Yonglu stated that Chinese railway workers resolutely and wholeheartedly support the just struggle of the Japanese working class.
    Beijing railway worker Li Ping'an and Dou Qi, a staff member of the Fengtai Inspection Depot, in their protest letters, unanimously demanded the immediate release of the twenty patriotic Japanese workers and called on people worldwide to offer assistance.
    The Communist Youth League, the Trade Union, and the Student Union of Renmin University, all students of the Northern Jiaotong University Beijing Railway College, all students of Beijing Normal University, all trainees of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee Training Class, and Guo Kun, a third-year student of the Electrical Engineering Department of the 工学院 (Institute of Technology) of Peking University, and fifteen others in their protest letters unanimously angrily condemned the atrocities of the American and Japanese reactionaries and demanded the immediate unconditional release of the twenty patriotic Japanese workers. Students of Beijing Normal University warned the American and Japanese reactionaries in their protest letter: "If you dare to continue to violate the will of the people worldwide and persecute peace fighters, you will certainly not escape the severe judgment of the people in the court of justice!"
