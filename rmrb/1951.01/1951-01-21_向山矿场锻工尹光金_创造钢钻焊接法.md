　　Xiangshan Mine Forgeman Yin Guangjin
　　Creates Steel Drill Welding Method
　　The steel drills used for mining at the Xiangshan Mine of the Anhui Ma'anshan Mining Bureau became blunt with use. After sharpening, they were used again, becoming shorter and shorter, and it looked like they could no longer be used. However, there were only two new steel drills in the warehouse. What to do? All the mine workers had recently been racking their brains over this matter.
　　Would it work to weld two old, short steel drills together? But the steel drill is hollow, with a center hole about a quarter of a centimeter in diameter. It needs to be joined firmly, and the hole needs to be open. What to do? The forgeman Yin Guangjin was constantly considering these problems in his mind. Then, he began to experiment. At first, the fire was too small, and the join was not tight. When the fire was too hot, the steel would fall apart like tofu dregs. If he hammered too lightly, the join would not be strong. If he hammered too hard, the center hole would be blocked. After many repeated experiments, he finally succeeded in welding them together. The first welded steel drill was tested and the result was exactly the same as a new steel drill. In the beginning, he could only weld two drills a day. Gradually, he gained experience, and welding one drill only took an hour and a half. In the patriotic production competition, in order to complete the task of welding steel drills, Lao Yin's eyes were burned by the fire, and his neck became swollen.
　　In the past, the steel drills used in the mine were all foreign-made, and there are not many factories in our country that can manufacture steel drills now. Comrade Yin Guangjin's creation has made a great contribution to the country's construction. The relevant departments are preparing to give him an award.

　　向山矿场锻工尹光金
    创造钢钻焊接法
    安徽马鞍山矿务局向山矿场采矿用的钢钻用钝了，升了再用，越用越短，眼看不能再用了。而仓库里新的钢钻只有两根。怎么办呢？全矿职工最近都为这件事在苦思焦虑着。
    把两根旧的、短了的钢钻焊接起来行吗？但钢钻是空心的，中孔直径约四分之一公分，又要接得牢，又要眼子通。这怎么办？锻工尹光金脑子里成天在考虑着这些问题。接着，他就动手试验。起初，火烧小了，接不紧，火大了，钢就像豆腐渣似的一块块地掉；锤得太轻，接不牢，锤重了，中孔眼子又塞住。经过了多少次的反复试验，最后终于焊接成功。第一根接成的钢钻试用的结果，和新的钢钻完全一样。刚开始时，他每天只能接两根，慢慢地有经验，焊接一根只要一个半小时。在爱国主义生产竞赛中，老尹为了完成焊接钢钻的任务，眼睛被火灼伤，脖子也发肿了。
    矿场过去所用的钢钻都是外国货，我国现在能制造钢钻的工厂也不多。尹光金工友这一创造，对国家的建设事业贡献极大。有关部门正准备给以奖励。
