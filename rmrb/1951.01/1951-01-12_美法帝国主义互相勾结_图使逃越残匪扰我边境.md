Xinhua News Agency, 10th. After suffering a disastrous defeat in Korea, U.S. imperialism is colluding with French imperialism, plotting to drive the Kuomintang remnant bandits who fled to Vietnam during the liberation of mainland China to invade our southern border.

According to a United Press dispatch from Taipei on December 28th, under the direction of the United States, the French colonial authorities in Vietnam and the Kuomintang remnant bandits are discussing how to utilize the Kuomintang remnant bandits who have fled to Vietnam. A United Press dispatch from Taipei on January 4th also revealed that these negotiations have concluded, and the United States has decided to conduct a new "investigation" of the situation in Vietnam.

The U.S. imperialist plot to use escaped Vietnamese Kuomintang remnant bandits to invade our border has been in the works for a long time. As early as August 11th of last year, the Hong Kong China Mail, quoting a Saigon dispatch from the Kuomintang reactionary newspaper Overseas Chinese Daily News, revealed that under the initiation and direction of the U.S. mission in Saigon, the U.S., France, and others held negotiations and decided that the U.S. mission would train and equip the escaped Vietnamese Kuomintang remnant bandits. The training center is located in Hanoi, commanded by the bandit leader Huang Jie. A large number of weapons and equipment have already been shipped from the United States to this training center. Furthermore, according to a report in the Hong Kong Wen Wei Po on December 27th of last year, the United States has allocated $600,000 from "aid to Vietnam military expenses" to arm and train the Kuomintang remnant bandits. Bandit leader Huang Jie flew from Vietnam to Taiwan and Tokyo in mid-November to conduct liaison regarding this matter.

　　美法帝国主义互相勾结
    图使逃越残匪扰我边境
    【新华社十日讯】美帝国主义在朝鲜遭受惨败后，正在和法帝国主义勾结，阴谋驱使在中国大陆解放时逃往越南的国民党残匪，侵扰我国南部边境。
    据合众社台北上月二十八日电透露：在美国主持下，越南法国殖民地当局与国民党残余匪帮正在商谈如何利用逃越的国民党残匪。合众社台北一月四日电并透露：这个谈判已经结束，美国已经决定对越南的情势作新的“调查”。
    美帝国主义利用逃越国民党残匪侵扰我国边境的阴谋已经进行很久，远在去年八月十一日，香港德臣西报引国民党反动报纸华侨日报西贡消息透露：在美国驻西贡使团的发起和主持下，美法等举行了一项谈判，决定由美国使团训练和装备逃越的国民党残匪，训练中心设在河内，由匪首黄杰任司令，大批的武器和装备已经由美国运往这个训练中心。又据香港文汇报去年十二月二十七日消息揭露：美国已由“援越军事费用”中拨款六十万美元，作为武装和训练国民党残匪之用。匪首黄杰曾于十一月中由越南飞往台湾和东京，为着这件事进行接洽。
