[By our newspaper] The capital's medical and health community, numbering over ten thousand people, held an anti-American, aid-Korea demonstration parade yesterday (21st). At 10:00 AM, over ten thousand people gathered at the Democracy Plaza of Peking University to hold a rally. Participating in the rally were the Beijing Medical Workers' Union, Beijing Medical and Health Joint Association, Beijing Branch of the Chinese Medical Association, Beijing Branch of the Chinese Red Cross Society, Chinese Medicine Association, Prepared Medicine Industry Association, Chinese Medicine Industry Association, Western Medicine Industry Association, Medical Workers' Union, as well as the National Peking University Medical College, Peking University Hospital, Union Medical College, Union Hospital, Central People's Hospital, North China People's Hospital, Tongren Hospital, National First Midwifery School, and various municipal hospitals, the Health Bureau, and the Maternal and Child Health Hospital, totaling over sixty units. The rally was chaired by Fang Shishan of the Chinese Medical Association, and Yu Yiti of the Medical and Health Joint Association served as the general commander. Famous physicians such as Hu ChuanKui, Li Kehong, Zhu Futang, and elderly traditional Chinese medicine doctors over seventy years old such as Xia Xiwu, Peng Fuqing, and Man Ruifu all participated in the rally.

Fang Shishan said in his speech: The Beijing medical and health community resolutely participates in the work of resisting America and aiding Korea. In addition to dispatching volunteer surgical teams, it is also conducting a large amount of battlefield surgery and first aid training, preparing to be dispatched at any time.

Following this, Li Kehong, Dean of the Affiliated Hospital of Union Medical College, spoke. He celebrated the Central People's Government's takeover of Union Medical College and expressed that the Chinese medical community has the power to eliminate the influence of American imperialist cultural aggression.

Subsequently, the conference passed a declaration, which put forward five patriotic covenants for the Beijing medical and health community: (1) Resolutely support Foreign Minister Zhou's four proposals to the United Nations on January 17. (2) Strengthen the viewpoint of serving the people, and dedicate technology to the soldiers defending the country and the working people. (3) Strive for invention and creation to ensure self-sufficiency in medical equipment. (4) Strengthen the study of current affairs and politics, eliminate pro-American, worship-American, and fear-American thoughts, and further hate, despise, and scorn American imperialism; learn from the advanced scientific experience of the Soviet Union and consolidate Sino-Soviet friendship. (5) Strengthen the great unity of the medical and health community and establish a national, mass-based, new Chinese medicine. The hearts of over ten thousand Chinese and Western medical and health workers were filled with patriotic enthusiasm, unanimously issuing calls to resist America and aid Korea, and resolved to further support the Korean people with practical actions.

The conference passed a letter of respect to Chairman Mao, a telegram of respect to the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, and a telegram to the People's Volunteer Army Surgical Team.

After the conference, the demonstration parade began. Conference Chairman Fang Shishan, Director of the Central People's Hospital Zhong Huilan, President of Peking University Medical College Hu Chuankui, Director of the Children's Hospital Zhu Futang, and others stood at the forefront of the parade. More than ten thousand medical and health workers, holding high thousands of red flags, marched forward shouting slogans such as "Oppose American Imperialist Aggression Against Taiwan and Korea," "Resolutely Eliminate the Aggressive Influence of American Imperialism," and "Medical and Health Workers of the Whole City Unite," and were welcomed by the general public along the way.
