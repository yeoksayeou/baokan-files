Business Circles in Southwest China, Lanzhou and Hangzhou
Actively Pay Autumn and Winter Taxes

　　[Xinhua News Agency] Business circles in various cities in the Southwest region are enthusiastically paying taxes. The "Clear Taxes Annually, Pay Off All Arrears" campaign initiated by business circles in Chongqing has been further developed. As of December 25th last year, Chongqing had completed 94.7% of its annual tax revenue target. Small and medium-sized city business circles in northern Sichuan, eastern Sichuan, and southern Sichuan administrative regions have also launched patriotic tax-paying competitions. In the Yingxi District of Nanchong, northern Sichuan, business circles from different industries and individual businesses have challenged each other, resulting in the complete fulfillment of the district's winter business tax within five days of its commencement. Industrialists and merchants in counties such as Santai and Nanbu have voluntarily launched mutual aid movements to ensure the timely deposit of tax payments, assisting a small number of their colleagues in resolving cash shortages. In Fuling, eastern Sichuan, collective tax payments were organized by industry. From the end of November to December 5th last year, twenty-five industries paid off their winter business tax in one lump sum. In Luxian, southern Sichuan, the Industrial and Commercial Tax Democratic Appraisal Conference held a meeting on December 11th to announce the appraisal results. Major businesses such as Lianyi Company, Jiayang Company, and Juxingcheng Bank paid up on the same day. On the morning of the 12th, taxpayers were already crowded in front of the People's Bank of China, waiting for it to open. Industries such as mountain products, sugar, soy sauce, photography, and toothbrush all paid their taxes in full. Business circles in Tianquan and Hanyuan, western Sichuan, have also been quick to pay taxes. Tianquan County's November industrial and commercial tax was fully deposited within two days of its commencement on December 5th. Business circles in other places, such as Kunming, Guiyang, and Ya'an, have also signed patriotic covenants and guaranteed to complete their tax payment tasks. In addition, industrial and commercial businesses run by ethnic minorities in various places have also joined the tax-paying upsurge. Tian Ruiqing of the Hui ethnic group, who runs a department store in Langzhong, northern Sichuan, and Yang Tianyou, a Hui ethnic group who runs a coarse cloth business, have both taken the lead in completing their tax tasks. As of now, northern Sichuan, eastern Sichuan, southern Sichuan, Guizhou and other places have smoothly completed this year's tax tasks.

　　[Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 6th] The patriotic movement of timely payment of autumn and winter business taxes and annual income tax by the Lanzhou business community, which lasted for thirteen days, successfully concluded on New Year's Eve in 1950. From December 19th of last year, the five bank offices in Lanzhou that collected taxes were crowded all day long with industrialists and merchants paying taxes. The preparatory committee of the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce and cadres in various industries, in addition to first paying their taxes, actively promoted the great significance of this patriotic movement in various industries and helped their colleagues overcome difficulties, thus powerfully promoting this patriotic movement to pay taxes. In order to celebrate the successful conclusion of this patriotic movement, the Municipal Taxation Bureau and the preparatory committee of the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce are actively preparing to hold a celebration meeting.

　　[Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 6th] The "Pay Off This Year's Taxes This Year" movement launched by business circles in Hangzhou at the end of last year has successfully concluded. As of December 31st of last year, 99% of the December 1950 industrial and commercial tax calculated based on business volume had been deposited; the amount of industrial and commercial tax calculated based on income for the second half of 1950 that had been deposited also exceeded 90%. The majority of industrial and commercial households with arrears have issued checks before the 5th of this month to ensure recent payment and avoid further delays.
