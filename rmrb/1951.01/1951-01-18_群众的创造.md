　　The Creativity of the Masses
    Li Bozhao
    In this campaign to resist America and aid Korea, protect our homes and defend our country, using art and literature to educate the masses has yielded great results. Indeed, in the past month or so, the changes in everyone's thinking have been more complex than in a normal year. Art and literature propaganda has played a significant and timely supporting role in resolving the ideological problems of the masses. A considerable number of outstanding mass creations have emerged, with significant impact on educating the masses. These include Liu Guozheng's "Young Guerrilla" from the Eighth Middle School, Peking University's "As Long as the Mountains Remain," Tsinghua University's adaptation of "On the Yalu River," the Normal University's "Wang Fengxi," Liu Yaoxin's fast-clapper piece "We Must Live a Good Life" from Yu Ying School, and Li Chuanxiu's fast-clapper performance "Resist America, Aid Korea, Defeat the Devils and Enjoy Peace." Most of these works have been performed dozens of times. For example, Li Chuanxiu's fast-clapper piece has been performed a total of forty-eight times. The creation of operas and dramas is relatively good. Popular songs include Wang Ximing's drum ballad "Fisherman's Hatred," Du Peng's "Four Guns," worker Li Weilian's "Demanding Blood Debt," Guan Xuezeng's "Blood Debt Must Be Repaid," Zhao Jian's Pingju opera "Chen Yumei Visits the Grave," Sun Yukui, Xi Xiangyuan, and Xin Daming's collaborative crosstalk "Such is America," Song Zhesheng and Du Peng's small opera "Model Family," Liu Canglang's drama "Mother's Heart," Guo Fenyang's small yangko opera "To Defend Production," and Yu Cun's "Brotherly Affection."
    The participants in the creations include workers, students, teachers, opera performers, and professional artists and writers. With a high degree of patriotic enthusiasm, they produced works in a hurry that met the needs of the masses, truly "providing charcoal in the snow." The Beijing Federation of Literary and Art Circles promptly collected these works (from November 9th to November 30th last year, 98 pieces were collected for reprinting) and reprinted them into books in a timely manner, supplying more than 40 performance units in the capital.
    The students and teachers in the capital took the lead in creating, promoting mass literary and artistic activities throughout the city, which is worthy of study and commendation. In order to deepen the propaganda to resist America and aid Korea, we should introduce, analyze, and study the works that have already influenced mass education, preserve the achievements of mass creation, and continuously improve them so that they are more complete and can achieve greater results. As for how to further improve the ideological content of the creations and refine the artistic form of the works, we need to discuss and solve them together. In order to achieve this goal, we put forward the following opinions for discussion:
    From the fifteen creations we have selected, the thematic ideas expressed, the themes selected, the images of the characters, the performance techniques, and the creative forms, there is a new development compared to the previous mass literature and art.
    The common characteristic of the works is that they all attempt to educate the people with patriotic thoughts and feelings, explaining that the motherland should be loved, is worthy of love, and how to love it. Starting from the lives of the masses, they oppose the U.S. imperialist aggression against Korea, inspire internationalist education, and explain that peaceful construction and peaceful life are the hopes of the people of the world, and also the hopes of the Chinese people. However, peace is not to be waited for, but to be strived for, and to be strived for hard and without fear of sacrifice; explaining that U.S. imperialism is a paper tiger, and the power of the people is invincible; resisting America and aiding Korea, protecting the home and defending the country are two inseparable aspects of one thing. In terms of materials, they are relatively simple and real. Many authors write about real people and real events, and the characters are also laborers, guerrillas, Koreans, Chinese volunteers, fishermen bombed by U.S. planes, families of the dead, workers, and fierce American soldiers that the masses are familiar with. Through these characters, the sharp struggle between the invaders and those who resist the invasion is reflected, arousing the sympathy, love, admiration, or hatred of the masses. The performance techniques are generally very natural and simple. What makes people happiest is that the students play guerrillas, working people, and Koreans relatively realistically. Because the thoughts, feelings, and lives of the performers are integrated with the masses, the images they perform are not distant from the masses, and they have completely gotten rid of the "student style." Even when playing American soldiers, they have broken away from the set of formulas used to perform Japanese soldiers in the early days of the War of Resistance Against Japan. I think these are very commendable. The art forms are also relatively rich, including yangko opera, drama, street drama, musical drama, living newspaper, fast-clapper drama, radio drama, poetry, songs, Ping opera, drum ballad, fast clapper, crosstalk, etc. There are also novel creations in language, such as the drum ballad "Four Guns," which is fresh, lively, and witty, without falling into clichés; the language of "Demanding Blood Debt" is clean and powerful; the fast clapper "Resist America, Aid Korea, Drive Away the Devils and Enjoy Peace" is light, fluent, lively, and vivid. Often, after reciting a section, the masses applaud non-stop.
    In this mass creation, the timely help and guidance of professional literary and art groups is not enough. In the future, if professional groups are more closely linked to mass creative activities, the educational role of literary and art propaganda in the patriotic movement will surely achieve greater results.

　　群众的创造
    李伯钊
    在这次抗美援朝保家卫国宣传中，以文艺宣传教育群众，收到很大的效果。的确，这一个多月来，每个人在思想上所发生的变化比平常一年，还要复杂些。文艺宣传在解决群众思想问题上起了重要的、及时的配合作用。其中涌现了相当数量出色的群众创作。在教育群众方面，有显著作用的作品，就有八中刘国正的《青年游击队员》，北大的《只要山还在》，清华改编的《鸭绿江上》，师大的《王凤喜》，育英刘曜昕作快板剧《咱们要过好日子》，李传琇表演的快板《抗美援朝打倒鬼子享太平》等。这些作品，大都演出过十数次或几十次，以李传琇的快板为例，总共演出了四十八次。戏曲创作比较好，在演唱中流行的，就有王希明作鼓词《渔夫恨》，杜澎作《四枝枪儿》，工人李维廉作《讨血债》，关学增作《血债血还》，赵坚作评剧《陈玉梅上坟》，孙玉奎、席香远、辛大明合作相声《如此美国》，宋哲生、杜澎作小型歌剧《模范家庭》，刘沧浪作话剧《母亲的心》，郭奋扬作小秧歌剧《为了保卫生产》，于村作《兄弟之谊》。
    参加创作的，有工人，学生，教师，戏曲艺人，专业的文艺工作者。他们以高度爱国主义的热情，紧张的赶制出来的作品，赶上了群众的需要，真正做到了“雪里送炭”。北京市文联及时搜集了这些作品（自去年十一月九日至十一月三十日止，搜集来翻印的作品有九十八件。）及时翻印成册，供应了首都四十余个表演单位。
    首都同学们和教师们，带头创作，推动了全市群众性的文艺活动，值得学习和表扬。为了深入抗美援朝宣传，我们应该介绍、分析、研究已经在群众教育中发生影响的作品，保存群众创作的成就，不断加以改进，使其更加完整，能收更大的效果。至于如何进一步提高创作的思想内容，和精炼作品的艺术形式，则须要我们共同来研讨和解决。为了达到这个目的，我们提出下面一些意见来供商讨：
    从我们现在选出的十五件创作里，所表现的主题思想，作品所选的题材，人物的形象，表演技术，及创作形式来看，比以往的群众文艺，有了新的发展。
    作品共同的特征，都是企图以爱国主义的思想感情教育人民，说明祖国应该热爱，值得热爱和如何热爱；从群众生活着眼，来反对美帝的侵朝行动，启发国际主义教育，说明和平建设、和平生活，是世界人民的希望，也是中国人民的希望，但是和平不是等得来的，而是靠争取，要辛辛苦苦，不怕牺牲的去争取；说明美帝是纸老虎，人民力量是无敌的；抗美援朝、保家卫国是一件事情分不开的两方面。取材方面，比较朴素真实，有不少的作者是写的真人真事，人物也是群众熟悉的劳动者、游击队员、朝鲜人、中国志愿军、被美机轰炸的渔夫、死难者的家属、工人、凶恶的美国兵等等。通过这些人物，反映出了侵略者和反抗侵略的尖锐斗争，激起了群众的同情、热爱、敬仰或者憎恨。表演的技术，一般很自然、朴素。最使人欢喜的，是同学们扮演游击队员、劳动人民、朝鲜人，比较逼真。由于表演者的思想、感情、生活，和群众打成一片，所表演的形象，和群众没有距离，完全摆脱了“学生腔”，即使扮演美国兵，也脱出了抗战的初期表演日本兵那一套公式。这些，我以为是十分难能可贵的。艺术形式，也比较很丰富，有秧歌剧、话剧、街头剧、歌舞剧、活报剧、快板剧、广播剧、诗歌、歌曲、评戏、鼓词、快板、相声等等。语言上也有新颖的创造，如《四枝枪儿》鼓词，新鲜、活泼、俏皮，不流于俗套；《讨血债》语言干净有力；《抗美援朝打走鬼子享太平》快板，语言轻快流畅，生动活泼，常常念一段，群众就不停的鼓掌一次。
    在这次群众创作中，文艺专业团体及时的帮助与指导，显得不够。今后专业团体同群众创作活动，更密切地联系起来，一定可以使文艺宣传在爱国运动中对群众的教育作用收到更大的效果。
