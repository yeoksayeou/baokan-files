American imperialism has invaded our Taiwan and friendly Korea, and now it is even attempting to make a separate peace with Japan and re-arm Japan, threatening the safety of all our nationalities. The people of all our nationalities must unite closely and fight to defend our motherland.

　　Representatives of various nationalities who spoke included Ma Jian of the Hui nationality, Pengsuke of the Mongolian nationality, Ji Jinmei of the Tibetan nationality, and Wu Diping of the Miao nationality.

　　At 3:00 p.m., the demonstration began. The parade of fifteen minority nationalities advanced, holding high the national flag and portraits of the people's leaders. Many of the Hui people participating in the parade wore white hats for worship and carried green flags with stars and crescents. In the parades of the Mongolian, Tibetan, Uyghur, and other nationalities, banners written in several ethnic languages fluttered. Lamas carried instruments such as large horns, drums, suonas, and conch shells. People of all nationalities shouted in different languages: "Oppose American Imperialist Arming of Japan!" "Long live Chairman Mao, the great teacher and leader of all nationalities in China!" The parade was warmly welcomed by the masses along the way. (Attached picture)
