　　I. Why Launch the "Support the Army and Cherish the Families of Martyrs" and "Support the Government and Love the People" Campaign
　　Recently, the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government promulgated five regulations on preferential treatment, stipulating various preferential treatment and compensation measures for revolutionary martyrs, revolutionary disabled personnel, and the families of martyrs, revolutionary soldiers, and revolutionary workers. The Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government and the General Political Department of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission also issued a joint directive, calling for the launch of a "Support the Army and Cherish the Families of Martyrs" campaign among the government and the people, and a "Support the Government and Love the People" campaign within the army between the New Year's Day and the Spring Festival. This is extremely important, and everyone should take it seriously.
　　Why? Because the victory of the Chinese revolution was not easily won. It was bought with the lives of revolutionary martyrs and achieved through the bloody struggle of revolutionary soldiers. Moreover, although the revolution has been victorious, the Kuomintang reactionaries are still making a last-ditch struggle, and American imperialism is still invading us. The People's Liberation Army is still diligently undertaking the heavy task of eliminating bandits and defending national defense. Therefore, we should support the army, help the army, resettle and care for revolutionary disabled personnel, and give preferential treatment to the families of martyrs and soldiers, and earnestly implement the preferential treatment regulations. At the same time, our army is the people's army. They come from the people and have always cherished the interests of the people. Now, they should further promote the spirit of loving the country and the people and strengthen their relationship with the people. In this way, the people will more actively support the army, making the army even stronger.
　　II. How to Launch the "Support the Army and Cherish the Families of Martyrs" and "Support the Government and Love the People" Campaign
　　First, launch education on supporting the army and cherishing the families of martyrs among the government and the people, and education on supporting the government and loving the people within the army. This education can be combined with education on patriotism and internationalism, combined with current affairs studies, and carried out in connection with the actual situation of various regions and units. Second, conduct mutual self-criticism and inspection. Wherever the government and the people have not provided sufficient care for the army, the families of martyrs, the families of revolutionary soldiers, the revolutionary disabled personnel, and demobilized soldiers, they should conduct in-depth self-criticism and formulate future improvement measures. The army should also check for violations of discipline against the people. If there is anything that has let the people down, apologies should be made, and compensation should be paid for any damage to the people's property. Sincerely examining oneself is the first step in forging close unity. Third, during the New Year's Day and the Spring Festival, organize joint celebrations and cultural and recreational activities between the army and the people, exchange New Year greetings, and mobilize the masses to comfort the families of martyrs, the families of soldiers, and revolutionary disabled soldiers. Fourth, each party should formulate a plan for doing a good job in "supporting the army and cherishing the families of martyrs" and "supporting the government and loving the people" in 1951.
　　III. How Government Work Cadres Should Do a Good Job in Preferential Treatment Work
　　Preferential treatment is a regular matter. To do a good job in preferential treatment work in 1951, it is necessary for government cadres to master the preferential treatment policies. Therefore, government cadres at all levels, especially cadres engaged in civil affairs work, should conscientiously study the five regulations on preferential treatment and grasp their spirit. The most important thing here is to organize and assist the families of martyrs, the families of revolutionary soldiers, the families of revolutionary workers, revolutionary disabled personnel, and demobilized soldiers in production so that they can settle down and establish themselves. The main methods of assistance are substitute farming in rural areas and job referrals in urban areas. Specific arrangements should be made based on local conditions, and regular inspections should be conducted. Those who do a good job in preferential treatment work must be commended, and those who do a bad job must be criticized. It is necessary to constantly mobilize and help the families of soldiers write letters to their sons and husbands in the army, telling them about the preferential treatment they receive, so that they can rest assured. It is necessary to continuously improve the political status of the families of martyrs, the families of revolutionary soldiers, etc., and make them glorious examples for the masses. It is necessary to cultivate model figures among them so that everyone can learn from them. To do these things well, government work cadres must have a high sense of responsibility and must oppose the perfunctory attitude of simply distributing grain and considering the matter closed. It is necessary to constantly educate the masses and organize the strength of the masses so that preferential treatment work becomes a mass work and must not rely solely on administrative orders.
　　IV. How Should the People Understand Preferential Treatment Work
　　Every person should recognize that many revolutionary soldiers and the families of martyrs, for the benefit of the people of the whole country, sent their sons and husbands to participate in the People's Liberation Army and engage in arduous struggles, and some even sacrificed their lives, making great contributions to our people. Without them, the revolution would not have been victorious, we would not have been liberated, and we would not have been able to live and work in peace and contentment. Therefore, it is entirely right for us to help the families of martyrs, the families of revolutionary soldiers, and revolutionary disabled soldiers. This is actually a kind of social mutual assistance and cannot be simply regarded as a burden. Because the families of martyrs and the families of revolutionary soldiers generally lack labor, the most important way to help the families of revolutionary soldiers and the families of martyrs in rural areas is substitute farming. Everyone contributes a few workdays to help the families of martyrs and the families of revolutionary soldiers, which is nothing to everyone, but the difficulties of the families of martyrs, the families of revolutionary soldiers, and revolutionary disabled soldiers are solved. The soldiers at the front know that their families have no difficulties and are naturally happy. This will further strengthen their will to love the country and the people and enable them to serve the people more wholeheartedly. Therefore, all matters of helping the families of martyrs and the families of revolutionary soldiers must be done sincerely. Substitute farming must be guaranteed to be well-cultivated, and it must be cultivated as seriously as one's own land, and not carelessly. Of course, the responsibility of substitute farming cannot be placed on a few people, but absolute egalitarianism is also undesirable. If more people from one village join the army and fewer from another village, there is no way to make it equally even. Substitute farm more if there are more, and substitute farm less if there are fewer, and don't be too concerned.
　　V. What Should the Families of Martyrs, the Families of Revolutionary Soldiers, Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers, and Demobilized Soldiers Do
　　The families of martyrs, the families of revolutionary soldiers, revolutionary disabled soldiers, and demobilized soldiers are of course glorious. They should receive assistance from the government and the people when they have difficulties, but they should not have a dependent mentality. Instead, they should strive to produce and do their best to solve their own livelihood problems with their own strength. Soldiers are glorious to serve the people outside, and military families should also strive to be models at home. It is glorious for soldiers to serve in the army, and it is also necessary to strive to be models when they are discharged and return home in order to maintain their glory, so that the masses will sincerely appreciate and admire them, and so that they will be willing to help us. The families of martyrs, the families of soldiers, revolutionary disabled soldiers, and demobilized soldiers should understand that although the masses do not directly join the army, they also contribute greatly to the revolution by producing in the rear, providing war service, and delivering public grain. Without the strength of the people, the revolution could not have been victorious. Therefore, don't become proud because you are the family of a martyr, the family of a soldier, a revolutionary disabled soldier, or a demobilized soldier, look down on the masses, or make unreasonable demands on the masses, causing them to be overwhelmed. Demobilized soldiers and revolutionary disabled soldiers who can continue to work should work in the rear, help the government and the people, especially help with militia training, help with propaganda work, and help with the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries. It is also necessary to overcome the thinking of egalitarianism among the families of martyrs and the families of revolutionary soldiers. Don't treat everyone equally with preferential treatment. Those who can be self-sufficient can receive less preferential treatment. Otherwise, the government's financial resources are limited, and the strength of the masses is also limited. If everyone wants it equally, it will prevent the families of martyrs and the families of revolutionary soldiers who have difficulties from receiving appropriate assistance.

### 展开“拥军优属”“拥政爱民”运动

　　展开“拥军优属”“拥政爱民”运动
    周方
    一  为什么要展开“拥军优属”“拥政爱民”运动
    最近，中央人民政府内务部颁发了五个优抚条例，规定了对于革命烈士、革命残废人员和烈士家属、革命军人家属、革命工作人员家属的各种优待抚恤办法，中央人民政府内务部又与人民革命军事委员会总政治部发出联合指示，要在新旧年关之间，在政府和人民方面展开一个“拥军优属”运动，在军队方面展开一个“拥政爱民”运动。这是极重要的事，大家应该认真地进行。
    为什么呢？因为中国革命的胜利不是容易得来的，是革命先烈牺牲性命换来的，是革命军人流血奋斗得来的。而且现在革命虽然胜利了，但国民党反动派还在作最后挣扎，美帝国主义还在侵略我们，人民解放军现在还是辛辛苦苦地担负着肃清土匪和保卫国防的重任。因此，我们应该拥护军队，帮助军队，安置和照顾革命残废人员，优待烈士和军人的家属，把优抚条例认真地贯彻起来。同时，我们的军队，又是人民的军队，他们来自人民，并且从来是爱护人民利益的，现在更要发扬爱国家爱人民的精神，加强和人民的关系。这样，人民就会更加积极地支援军队，使军队更有力量。
    二  如何展开“拥军优属”“拥政爱民”运动
    第一，在政府和人民方面展开拥军优属的教育，在军队方面展开拥政爱民的教育。这种教育可以结合爱国主义和国际主义的教育，结合时事学习，联系各地、各部队的实际情况来进行。第二，彼此进行检讨和检查，凡是政府和人民对军队，对烈士家属、革命军人家属，对革命残废人员和复员军人，有照顾不够的地方，都要深刻地检讨，并定出今后改进的办法。军队对人民有违反纪律的地方，也要检查。有什么对不住老百姓的事，要道歉，打坏了老百姓的东西，要赔偿。双方诚恳地检讨自己，是密切团结的第一步。第三，可以趁着新旧年关，展开军民之间的联欢和文化娱乐活动，互相拜年贺喜，发动群众慰问烈士家属、军人家属和革命残废军人。第四，各自规定一九五一年做好“拥军优属”和“拥政爱民”工作的计划。
    三  政府工作干部怎样做好优抚工作
    优抚是经常的事。要把一九五一年优抚工作做得好，就要靠政权干部能够掌握优抚政策。所以各级政权干部特别是民政工作干部，都要认真学习五个优抚条例，掌握它的精神，这里最重要的，就是组织和帮助烈士家属、革命军人家属、革命工作人员家属、革命残废人员和复员军人进行生产，使他们能够安家立业。帮助的主要办法，在乡村是代耕，在城市是介绍职业。要根据当地情况作具体布置，并要作经常的检查。凡是把优抚工作做得好的，一定要表扬，做得坏的，一定要批评。要经常动员和帮助军属把大家优待他们的情况写信告诉他们在军队里的儿子、丈夫，使他们放心。要不断提高烈士家属、革命军人家属等的政治地位，使他们成为群众的光荣榜样。要培养他们当中的模范人物，使大家向他们学习。政府工作干部要作好这些，必须要有高度的责任心，必须反对单管发粮，推出门算事的敷衍态度。要经常教育群众，组织群众的力量，使优抚工作成为群众性的工作，决不能单靠行政命令。
     四  人民应当怎样认识优抚工作
    每一个人民都应该这样认识：许多革命军人及烈士家属为了全国人民的利益，使他们的儿子和丈夫去参加人民解放军，进行艰苦的斗争，有的还牺牲了性命，对我们人民作了伟大的贡献。没有他们，革命就不会胜利，我们就不能获得解放，就不能安居乐业。所以我们帮助烈士家属、革命军人家属、革命残废军人是完全应该的。这实际上是一种社会互助，不能简单地看作是一种负担。因为一般烈士家属、革命军人家属都比较缺乏劳动力，所以农村中帮助革命军人家属及烈士家属的最主要办法就是代耕。大家出几个工帮助烈士家属、革命军人家属，这对大家算不了什么，而烈士家属、革命军人家属和革命残废军人的困难问题就解决了。前方将士知道他们的家属没有困难，心中自然高兴，这样就会更加强他们爱国家、爱人民的意志，使他们更安心地为人民服务。所以，凡是帮助烈士家属、命革军人家属的事，都要实心去干，代耕就要保证耕好，要和耕自己的地一样认真地耕，不要马虎。当然，不能把代耕的责任放在少数人的身上，但绝对的平均主义也是要不得的，一个村参军的人多些，另一个村少些，要想拉得一样平，是没有办法的，多就多代耕点，少就少代耕点，不要太计较。
    五  烈士家属、革命军人家属与革命残废军人、复员军人应该怎
        么样
    烈士家属、革命军人家属与革命残废军人、复员军人，当然是光荣的，他们有困难应该受到政府和人民的帮助，但也不要有依赖观点，而应该自己努力生产，尽力用自己的力量来解决自己的生活问题。军人在外面为人民服务，是光荣的，军属在家中，也要争取模范。军人在军队中服务时是光荣的，退伍复员回家，也要争取作模范，才能保持光荣，才能使群众真心感激和佩服，才能使他们乐意帮助我们。烈属、军属、革命残废军人、复员军人应该了解：群众虽然没有直接参军，但在后方生产，出战勤，出公粮，也为革命出了很大的力量，要没有人民的力量，革命也不能胜利。因此不要因为是烈属、军属或革命残废军人、复员军人就骄傲起来，看不起群众，向群众作不合理的要求，使群众不胜其烦。复员军人和革命残废军人，凡能继续工作的，都应该在后方工作，帮助政府和人民，特别帮助民兵的训练，帮助作宣传工作，帮助镇压反革命的工作。在烈士、革命军人家属中也要克服平均主义的思想，不要一律平均受优待，能自给的，优待可以少一些。不然政府财力有限，群众力量也有限，大家平均要，反而使有困难的烈士家属、革命军人家属，不能得到恰当的帮助。
