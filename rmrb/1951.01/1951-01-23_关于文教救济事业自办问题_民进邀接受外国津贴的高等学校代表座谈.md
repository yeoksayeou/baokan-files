    On the Issue of Self-Management of Cultural, Educational, and Relief Undertakings
    China Association for Promoting Democracy Invites Representatives from Universities Receiving Foreign Subsidies to a Symposium
    [Xinhua News Agency, January 21st] The China Association for Promoting Democracy (CAPD) hosted representatives from universities across the country receiving foreign subsidies on the evening of the 18th, and held a symposium. Representatives attending included administrative representatives, board representatives, and student representatives from the University of Shanghai, Aurora University, Soochow University, University of Nanking, Ginling College, Cheeloo University, Hangchow University, St. John's University, Aurora Women's College of Arts and Sciences, Lingnan University, Huachung University, Oberlin-in-China Memorial Schools, Tientsin University, Peking Union Medical College, Fu Jen Catholic University, and Yenching University. CAPD representatives present included Chairman Ma Xulun, Vice Chairman Wang Shao'ao, Secretary-General Xu Guangping, Minister of Education Zhou Jianren, and Minister of Propaganda Dong Qiusi.

    The meeting began with a speech by Chairman Ma Xulun. He explained that the main purpose of this symposium was to discuss two issues: one was the issue of self-management of cultural, educational, and relief undertakings, and the other was the issue of transforming Chinese Christian and Catholic religions into people's religions. Subsequently, participants actively spoke.

    President Li Zhaohuan of Hangchow University said: The Chinese people have stood up. We must work harder and ensure that, under the leadership of the Central People's Government and Chairman Mao, we will strive to provide the education needed for building a new China to the very end.

    Vice President Huang Pu of Huachung University said: The overriding task at present is to Resist America, Aid Korea. We understand the political and military offensives of American imperialism, but we often neglect its cultural aggression. Those of us engaged in cultural and educational work should take more responsibility in this regard, especially those of us who participate in the work of church schools. In the past, we unknowingly were used by imperialism, but now we are awakened and stand up. We must be in the vanguard on the cultural front in the war against American imperialism. I represent the Christian schools in Wuhan in making a guarantee that we are willing to dedicate all our strength and wholeheartedly strive, under the leadership of the Central People's Government, to fight to the end to overthrow the cultural aggression forces of American imperialism.

    President Yang Deqi of Cheeloo University said: We must not only sever economic ties with American imperialism, but also eradicate it ideologically. Just now, we received a telegram from Jinan, sent from the United States, asking me to go to Hong Kong to discuss funding issues. This also shows that American imperialism is still trying to exploit loopholes. I hope we are all vigilant, do not fall into their trap, and resolutely break off all relations with them.

    Yu Rixuan, Chairman of the University Council of the University of Shanghai, said: How much has the United States spent to lure us in? In the case of the University of Shanghai, it's only $500 a month! All American teachers at the University of Shanghai have interfered with and suppressed all anti-imperialist speeches and actions of Chinese teachers and students. Their crimes are endless. It is a matter of course for us to resist the United States and reclaim the right to education, but that is not enough. After we reclaim it, we must run the schools even better and strengthen patriotic education in all aspects to thoroughly eliminate the cultural aggression forces of American imperialism in China.

    President Yang Yongqing of Soochow University said: We will bravely shoulder the task of eliminating the influence of American imperialist cultural aggression. This is an epoch-making and glorious mission. We guarantee to contribute all our strength and do our best to implement the decision of the Government Administration Council. We all know that American culture is a selfish and self-serving culture that hinders human progress, and we must eliminate its toxins.

    President Wu Yifang of Ginling College said: The wise measures of the Government Administration Council give us immense strength and courage. As an educator in a church school, in addition to wholeheartedly supporting the decision of the Government Administration Council, we must also thoroughly examine and resolutely remove the ideological influence that American imperialism has had on us. For example, there are still many people who consider themselves to be apolitical, and this kind of thinking may be exploited by American imperialism. We must bravely, thoroughly, and revolutionarily cooperate with the government to establish a new Chinese people's education system. I am confident that not only can we implement the government's policies and resolutely break with American imperialism, but we can also bravely and boldly carry out the innovation movement, cultivate talents who love the motherland and serve the people, and work hard to build a new China.

    Acting President Li Fangxun of the University of Nanking said: I came to Beijing with a heavy burden because our school has very little funding that we can raise ourselves, and most of it comes from abroad. Once foreign subsidies stop coming, we feel it is a serious problem. After attending meetings in Beijing for a few days and hearing the government's brilliant and correct measures and instructions, I felt that the People's Government's care for us was truly meticulous, and the heavy burden was lifted. Jinling has been poisoned for sixty years, and its roots are very deep. In general, it is to allow American imperialists to have the freedom to be reactionary in the school. Today, we must resolutely and thoroughly uproot this poisonous root.

    Professor Qian Junye of Tientsin University said: Our Tientsin and Aurora Universities, like Zhen旦 [Translator's note: Original text contains what seems to be a typographical error], are schools run by the Catholic Church, and the funding comes from France and Rome, which seems to have nothing to do with American imperialism. However, since the Resist America movement began, the money has to be allocated from the American treasury, which shows that French Catholic schools also have close ties with American imperialism. We should be more vigilant.

    Professor Pan Shizi of St. John's University said: St. John's University has experienced three major anti-imperialist struggles in its seventy-year history, and today we have finally achieved victory. American cultural aggression is not only present in church universities, but the entire education sector has been poisoned by it. For example, the education system is modeled after the American one. Shanghai is the city most affected by imperialist aggression. It is not enough to simply reclaim the right to education. We must make long-term efforts to completely eradicate the poison we have been subjected to.

    President Hu Wenyao of Aurora University said: Under French rule, as a president, I had no freedom to use even a single penny. They were full of lies, arrogant, complacent, and oppressed the Chinese people, treating us like slaves. I deeply feel sorry for the students because I am a president of Aurora University in name only. In fact, I was a slave and accomplice of the French and Americans. Thanks to Chairman Mao for leading the Chinese people to stand up. Not only have we stood up, but we have also raised our iron fists to face the imperialists. I, this president in name only, should also be liberated. From now on, I want to be a president in name and in reality. I am already over sixty years old, and I want to take on the heavy responsibility of transforming Aurora University. It may be somewhat difficult to shoulder this heavy burden, but I want to dedicate everything I have and bravely take on this glorious task.

    President Chen Yuan of Fu Jen Catholic University said: I used to be the president of a school that accepted American subsidies. Because we have been most deeply insulted by imperialism, we also understand them the most deeply. Once we have leadership, this patriotism will be even more fervent than that of ordinary people.

    Representatives Zhou Zhongqi and Professor Cen Jiawu of Lingnan University unanimously pointed out: Lingnan University was funded by donations from overseas Chinese. Lingnan University is a school where American imperialism invested the least money and achieved the greatest results. American imperialism only provided a few professors and a small amount of occasional book fees. American imperialism colluded with and used lackeys in the school to control Lingnan University. The facts of Lingnan University have educated those who are confused, transforming their pro-American and worshipful-of-America thoughts. Now everyone is determined to bring an end to Lingnan's reactionary history.

    Shu Zehu, Vice Chairman of the Student Union of the University of Nanking, said: Our students at Jinling University have been tested in the struggle against imperialist elements such as Baylor, who insulted students, and have received the enthusiastic support of patriotic youth across the country. Today, we are very fortunate to have the leadership of predecessors who love the motherland as much as we do.

    Chai Degeng, Chairman of the Trade Union of Fu Jen Catholic University, said: Although our Fu Jen Catholic University has been taken over by the government, because we have been deeply poisoned by American imperialism in the past, many ideological problems still exist. Therefore, we must strengthen political education to eliminate all kinds of ideological toxins. In the future, I hope that we can all work together to eliminate the toxins of American imperialist cultural aggression and actively engage in the construction of a new democratic culture. Xu Bingxin, Chairman of the Student Union of Fu Jen Catholic University, said: We at Fu Jen victoriously defeated American imperialism's bullying of Fu Jen, and in the anti-imperialist struggle, under the policy of freedom of belief, we formed an unprecedented great unity. The teachers guarantee to teach well, the students guarantee to learn well, and all teachers and students enthusiastically participated in the patriotic movement to Resist America, Aid Korea, combining patriotism with action, and are always ready to respond to the call of the motherland to work hard to build a new China.

    Student Representative Xu Qinhua of Ginling College said: After listening to the accusations of all the seniors today, I hate American imperialism even more, and at the same time, I love my motherland even more. The teachers have all guaranteed to resolutely cut off ties with American imperialism and use their own strength to run the Chinese people's education. As a young student, I am also willing to make the same guarantee, let us teachers and students unite and work together to thoroughly, completely, and forever eliminate the forces of American imperialist cultural aggression.

    Finally, Ma Xulun spoke on behalf of the China Association for Promoting Democracy. He pointed out: Resisting America and Aiding Korea is a long-term struggle. In addition to the victory in the military and political struggle, we must also achieve victory in the struggle to eliminate American imperialist cultural aggression on the cultural front. Today, we must not only accuse American imperialism, but also examine ourselves to see how much of the toxins of American imperialist cultural aggression still remain in ourselves, and try to eliminate them. He said: He agreed with the opinions of the participants: 1. Strengthen political study and get rid of ideological baggage; 2. Promote the spirit of patriotism and widely launch patriotic movements; 3. Strengthen unity and jointly fight to eliminate American imperialist cultural aggression in Resist America, Aid Korea. Finally, the entire audience enthusiastically applauded and passed the proposal of the University of Shanghai: that the principals, directors, faculty, staff, and student representatives present jointly issue a declaration supporting Foreign Minister Zhou's four proposals to the United Nations.

　　关于文教救济事业自办问题
    民进邀接受外国津贴的高等学校代表座谈
    【新华社二十一日讯】中国民主促进会于十八日晚招待全国各地接受外国津贴的高等学校代表，并举行座谈会。到有沪江大学、震旦大学、东吴大学、金陵大学、金陵女子文理学院、齐鲁大学、之江大学、圣约翰大学、震旦女子文理学院、岭南大学、华中大学、铭贤学院、津沽大学、协和医学院、辅仁大学、燕京大学等学校的行政代表、董事会代表和学生代表。中国民主促进会到会的有该会主席马叙伦、副主席王绍鏊、秘书长许广平、教育部部长周建人、宣传部部长董秋斯等人。
    会议首由主席马叙伦致词。他说明这次座谈会主要想谈两个问题，一个是文教救济事业自办问题，一个是中国基督教天主教改变为人民宗教问题。接着，与会者即踊跃发言。
    之江大学校长黎照寰说：中国人民站起来了，我们要加倍努力，保证在中央人民政府与毛主席领导下，为建设新中国所需要的教育而奋斗到底。
    华中大学副校长黄溥说：目前压倒一切的任务是抗美援朝。我们了解美帝对我们的政治军事进攻，但常忽视其文化侵略。我们从事文化教育工作的人应多负这一方面的责任，尤其是我们参加教会学校工作的人，过去自己不知不觉受了帝国主义的利用，现在觉悟了，站起来了。我们要在文化战线上与美帝国主义作先锋战，我代表武汉市基督教学校来作一个保证，我们愿献出一切力量，全心全意地在中央人民政府领导下为打倒美帝国主义文化侵略势力而斗争到底。
    齐鲁大学校长杨德齐说：我们不但要从经济上与美帝国主义斩断关系，且要从思想上斩草除根。刚才我们收到济南转来的由美国拍来的电报，要我去香港商谈经费问题，这也可以说明美帝国主义仍在想钻空子。希望我们一致警惕，不要上钩，坚决与他断绝一切关系。
    沪江大学校务委员会主任委员余日宣说：美国花了多少代价来引我们上钩呢？在沪江来说一个月不过五百美金呵！在沪江所有美籍教员对中国教员学生的一切反帝言论行动都横加干涉、压迫。他们的罪行是控诉不完的。我们抗美，将教育权收回这是天经地义的事，但这不够，我们收回后，还要把学校办得更好，要从各方面加强爱国主义教育，彻底肃清美帝在中国的文化侵略势力。
    东吴大学校长杨永清说：我们将要勇敢地来担负肃清美帝国主义文化侵略的影响。这是划时代的光荣任务。我们保证贡献一切力量，尽心尽力来贯彻政务院的决定。我们都知道美国的文化是自私自利的文化，是阻碍人类进步的，我们必须消除其毒素。
    金陵女子文理学院院长吴贻芳说：政务院的英明措施给予我们莫大的力量与勇气，作为一个教会学校的教育工作者，除竭诚拥护政务院的决定外，还要彻底地检查，坚决地除去美帝国主义给我们的思想影响。例如现在还有许多人自以为是超政治的，这种思想就可能被美帝国主义所利用。我们要勇敢地彻头彻尾地有革命性地来配合政府建立中国人民的新的教育制度，我自信不但能作到贯彻政府的政策，坚决与美帝割断关系，而且能勇敢大胆地来进行革新运动，培养热爱祖国为人民服务的人材，为建设新中国而努力。
    金陵大学代理校长李方训说：我挑了一个沉重的担子到北京来，因我们学校自己能筹的经费甚少，大部分来自外国，一旦外国津贴不能来，我们便感到是一个严重的问题。到北京开了几天会，听到了政府高明正确的措施与指示，感到人民政府与我们的照顾真是无微不至，重担是放下了。金大受了六十年的毒，其根源是很深的，总起来说是要让美帝国主义者在学校里有反动的自由。今天我们是要坚决地、彻底地拔掉这个毒根。
    津沽大学教授钱君晔说，我们津沽和震旦大学一样，都是天主教所办的学校，经费是法国与罗马来的，好像与美帝国主义无关，但自抗美运动发生后，钱要从美国帐房拨来，这就说明法国天主教学校和美帝国主义也有密切关系。我们应该提高警惕。
    圣约翰大学教授潘世兹说：圣约翰大学七十年历史中有三次大的反帝国主义斗争，今天终于得到了胜利。美国文化侵略不仅在教会大学，即在全国教育界都受其毒害，比如教育制度就是学美国的。上海是受帝国主义侵略影响最大的都市，仅仅收回教育权还不行，必须经过长期努力，把所受毒害根除净尽。
    震旦大学校长胡文耀说：在法国人统治下，作一个校长用一块钱都没有自由，他们满口假话，骄傲自满，欺压中国人，把我们当作奴才。我深感对不起学生，因为我是一个有名无实的震旦校长，事实上我是作了法国人、美国人的奴隶与帮凶。感谢毛主席领导中国人民站起来了，不但站起来了，而且举起了铁拳面对着帝国主义者，我这个有名无实的校长也该翻身了。从此以后我要作一个有名有实的校长。我已是六十多岁的人了，我要担负起改造震旦这一重任，担负起这个重担是可能有些困难的，但是我要献出我的一切，勇敢地来担任这一光荣任务。
    辅仁大学校长陈垣说：我过去是接受美国津贴的学校的校长，因为我们受帝国主义的侮辱最深，对他们了解也最深，一经有了领导，这种爱国心，便比一般人更要热烈。
    岭南大学代表周钟岐和教授岑家梧一致指出：岭南大学是各地华侨捐款办的，岭南大学是美帝国主义出钱最少而收效最大的一个学校。美帝国主义只出了几个教授和一小部分不经常的图书费。美帝国主义勾结利用学校中的奴才控制了岭大。岭南大学的事实已教育了那些思想糊涂的人，转变了他们亲美崇美的思想，现在大家有决心要把岭南的反动历史作一个结束。
    金陵大学学生会副主席舒泽湖说：我们金大同学曾经过反帝国主义分子贝勒斯等侮辱学生的斗争的考验，得到了全国爱国青年的热烈支持。今天我们有着和我们同样热爱祖国的前辈的领导，我们是非常幸福的。
    辅仁大学工会主席柴德赓说：我们辅仁大学虽经政府接办，但因为我们过去受美帝国主义毒害很深，还有许多思想问题存在。因此我们必须加强政治教育来肃清各种思想毒素。今后希望我们大家共同为肃清美帝国主义文化侵略毒素，积极从事新民主主义文化建设而努力。辅仁大学学生会主席徐炳鑫说：我们辅仁胜利地击败了美帝国主义对辅仁的欺侮，并在反帝斗争中，在信仰自由之政策下，形成了空前的大团结。教的保证教好，学的保证学好，全校师生热烈参加了抗美援朝的爱国运动，将爱国主义与行动结合起来，随时准备响应祖国号召为建设新中国而努力。
    金陵女子文理学院学生代表须沁华说：今天听了各位前辈的控诉之后，使我更仇恨美帝国主义，同时也更热爱我祖国。师长们都保证了要坚决斩断和美帝国主义的联系，以自己的力量来办好中国人民的教育事业。作为一个青年学生的我也愿作同样保证，让我们师生团结一致为彻底地、完全地、永远地肃清美帝国主义文化侵略势力而努力。
    最后由马叙伦代表中国民主促进会讲话。他指出：抗美援朝是一个长期奋斗的过程，在军事政治斗争胜利之外，我们还要从文化战线上取得肃清美帝国主义文化侵略斗争的胜利。今天我们不仅要控诉美帝国主义，还要检讨自己，看我们自己身上还存留有多少美帝国主义文化侵略的毒素，并且设法予以肃清。他说：他同意与会者的意见：一、加强政治学习，丢掉思想包袱；二、发扬爱国主义精神，广泛展开爱国运动；三、加强团结，共同为抗美援朝肃清美帝国主义文化侵略而斗争。最后全场并热烈鼓掌通过了沪江大学的建议：由出席的各校校长、董事、教职员、学生代表联名发表宣言拥护周外长向联合国提出的四项提议。
