　　China's "Matrosov"
　　Heroic Martyr Xiao Guobao
　　Xiao Guobao, deputy squad leader and Communist Party member of a certain unit of the Guizhou Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, was a "Matrosov"-type heroic martyr. In a bandit suppression battle in the deep mountains of Miaoling, Changshun County, Guizhou, he continued fighting despite being wounded, and blocked the enemy's machine gun with his body, enabling subsequent troops to completely annihilate the remaining 400-plus bandits of Chiang Kai-shek's "Guizhou People's Anti-Communist Self-Salvation Army."
　　On November 13th of last year, after several days and nights of continuous tracking and pursuit, our bandit suppression troops surrounded the remaining bandits of the "Guizhou People's Anti-Communist Self-Salvation Army" in Doupengchong (village), a remote mountain area in Miaoling, Changshun County, southern Guizhou. The bandits, attempting to escape their fate of annihilation, desperately struggled to break through the encirclement. In the mountain gully in front of them, within dozens of meters, the bandits used a machine gun to block the assault route of the first squad of the second company of our regiment. Deputy squad leader Xiao Guobao was determined to eliminate the enemy at a small cost. He gripped his submachine gun and charged single-handedly into the enemy's position to seize the bandits' machine gun. As he took a few steps, after firing the first burst from his submachine gun, he was unfortunately wounded in the waist and fell to the hillside. He discovered that 20 meters ahead, a bandit was raising a pistol to shoot at him. In this extremely critical moment, he endured the pain and charged forward, killing the bandit. At this time, he was wounded a second time, and his body was covered in blood, lying on the ground. The enemy's machine gun was still firing fiercely. He struggled to get up and bravely lunged forward, using his body to block the enemy's machine gun. In his final seconds, he shouted, "Charge! Capture Cao Shaohua alive!" Xiao Guobao heroically sacrificed himself. The soldiers, stepping on the path opened by his blood and flesh, responded and charged forward. Our bandit suppression troops, with six squads, finally annihilated more than 400 bandits and captured the bandit chief "Commander-in-Chief" Cao Shaohua, who was hiding in the cracks of the rocks.
　　After the battle, the Communist Party Committee of the regiment issued an obituary to all units to mourn the heroic sacrifice of Xiao Guobao, and posthumously awarded Xiao Guobao the title of "Model Party Member" and "First-Class Combat Hero" of the regiment. Guizhou Military Region's "Company Life" newspaper and Southwest Military Region's "People's Soldier" newspaper both published editorials calling on all officers and soldiers to strive to learn from Xiao Guobao's great spirit of self-sacrifice. The People's Soldier newspaper also published the heroic deeds of Matrosov, a hero of the Soviet Patriotic War, calling on officers and soldiers of all units in the Southwest Military Region to seriously discuss and study the noble qualities of patriotism of Xiao Guobao and Matrosov.
　　Editor's Note: Matrosov was a soldier in the Soviet army. During the Patriotic War against the invasion of Hitler's Germany, he blocked the machine gun of the enemy's bunker with his body, ensuring the completion of the combat mission. On June 19, 1943, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union posthumously awarded Matrosov the honorary title of "Hero of the Soviet Union."

　　中国的“马特洛索夫” 
    英雄烈士萧国宝
    人民解放军贵州军区某部副班长，共产党员萧国宝是一个“马特洛索夫”型的英雄烈士。他在贵州长顺县苗岭深山的一次剿匪战斗中，负伤不下火线，并以肉体堵住敌人的机枪口，使后续部队全歼蒋匪“贵州人民反共自救军”残余四百余人。
    去年十一月十三日，我剿匪部队经过连续几昼夜的跟踪追击后，将匪“贵州人民反共自救军”残股包围在黔南长顺县苗岭深山中的斗蓬冲（村）。匪徒妄想逃脱被歼命运，拚命挣扎突围。匪徒在正面几十公尺的山坳间，以一挺机枪，封锁住我某团二连一班的冲锋道路。副班长萧国宝决心以小的代价消灭敌人，他紧握着冲锋枪，单身突入敌阵去夺取匪徒的机枪。当他刚冲了几步，打完了冲锋枪的第一梭子弹，不幸腰部受伤，匍匐在山坎上，他发现前面二十公尺远，有一个匪徒正举起手枪向他射击，在这万分危急的一瞬间，他忍痛地猛冲上去，打死了那个匪徒。这时，他又二次负伤，血溅满身，躺在地上。敌人的那挺机枪仍在猛烈地射击着。这时，他挣扎起来，勇猛的直扑上去，用自己的肉体堵住了敌人的机枪口。在最后的几秒钟，他还高呼“冲呀！活捉曹绍华！”萧国宝英勇壮烈地牺牲了，战士们踏着他用血肉开辟的道路，应声冲了上去。我剿匪部队以六个班的兵力，终于全歼该股匪徒四百多名，并活捉了钻在石头缝中的匪首“总司令”曹绍华。
    战斗结束后，该团中共党委会，为悼念壮烈牺牲的萧国宝，特向各部发出了讣告，并追赠萧国宝为该团的“模范党员”和“一等战斗英雄”。贵州军区《连队生活》报及西南军区《人民战士》报，为此均发表社论，号召全体指战员努力学习萧国宝自我牺牲的伟大精神。人民战士报并同时刊出苏联卫国战争时期的英雄马特洛索夫的英雄事迹，号召西南军区各部指战员们认真讨论和学习萧国宝与马特洛索夫的爱国主义的崇高品质。
    编者按：马特洛索夫是苏联军队中一个战士。在抵抗希特勒德国侵略的卫国战争中，他以自己的身体堵塞敌人地堡的机枪口，保证了战斗任务的完成。一九四三年六月十九日苏联最高苏维埃主席团追赠马特洛索夫以“苏联英雄”的光荣称号。
