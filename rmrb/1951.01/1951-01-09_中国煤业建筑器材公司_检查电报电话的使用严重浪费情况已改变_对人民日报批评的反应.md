　　China Coal Industry Building Materials Company
    Checks the Serious Waste of Telegrams and Telephones, Situation Changed
    Reaction to People's Daily Criticism
    Editor's Note: After the People's Daily published a criticism on December 8, 1950, regarding the serious waste of telegrams and telephones by the Northern Jiangsu Branch of the China National Food Corporation, the China Coal Industry Building Materials Company informed us of their investigation into the use of long-distance calls. To more effectively save national expenditures in the future, the company has formulated measures for the future use of telegrams and long-distance calls. This kind of humble self-examination of work and serious and responsible attitude towards the country and the people is good. Below is the letter from the China Coal Industry Building Materials Company to this newspaper:
          Comrade Editor:
    The China Coal Industry Building Materials Company has long established measures for the use of long-distance telephones to facilitate work and save national expenditures, but many have not been followed. Some comrades do not have enough awareness of cherishing national property, and they use express telephone calls regardless of importance or urgency. They also do not prepare adequately before making calls, delaying the time of the call, resulting in waste. Our investigation and handling results are as follows:
    Guo De, the chief of the Price Section of the Business Department of our company, made an express telephone call to Shijiazhuang on November 4, which lasted for 48 minutes, costing 384,000 yuan. Qi Runtang, a colleague in the same section, made a long-distance call on September 12, but instead of waiting, he went home for dinner without entrusting someone else to answer it. By the time the call came, they had to find him at his home, which prolonged the call. Chen Xianxuan, a clerk in the Price Section of the Business Department, made an express telephone call to Hankou on November 13, which lasted for 39 minutes, costing 825,000 yuan. On December 8, he made an express telephone call to Tianjin, which lasted for 39 minutes, costing 156,000 yuan. These calls could have been resolved with ordinary telephone calls, and they did not make sufficient preparations before speaking, resulting in a long delay. Zhu Shixiang, a clerk in the Transportation Section of the Storage and Transportation Department, made an express telephone call to Jinan on December 4, which lasted for 42 minutes, costing 462,000 yuan. After placing the express call, he did not speak himself but entrusted a new comrade to speak on his behalf, resulting in the matter not being clearly explained and prolonging the call time.
    We have conducted self-criticism and handled the above problems, and we have decided that in the future, all departments and sections must have the department or section chief or deputy chief responsible for making long-distance calls. If more than three calls are needed or an express call is required, it must be approved by the department head. Since implementing a strict management system, our company's expenditure on telegrams and telephone calls has decreased from more than 39,000 units (1,500 yuan per unit) in October to only 12,000 units in November. This shows that most of our past use of long-distance telephones and telegrams was wasteful.

　　中国煤业建筑器材公司
    检查电报电话的使用严重浪费情况已改变
    对人民日报批评的反应
    编者按：本报一九五○年十二月八日刊载对中国粮食公司苏北分公司使用电报电话严重浪费的批评后，中国煤业建筑器材公司将他们对使用长途电话情况的检查来信告诉我们。为了今后更有效地节省国家的开支，该公司特拟定了今后使用电报、长途电话的办法。这种虚心检查工作，对国家人民严肃负责的作风是好的。下面是中国煤业建筑器材公司给本报的来信：
          编辑同志：
    中国煤业建筑器材公司为便利工作，节省国家开支，对使用长途电话，早经规定办法，但多未按照执行。有些同志对爱护国家资财认识不够，不分轻重缓急，使用加急电话，且在通话前不作充分准备，拖延了通话的时间，以致造成浪费现象。我们检查情况和处理结果如下：
    本公司业务处物价科科长郭德同志于十一月四日向石家庄打加急电话一次，共用时间达四十八分，合款三十八万四千元。该科齐润棠同志于九月十二日叫长途电话后，既不等候，又未委托他人代接，竟回家吃饭，及至电话来了后，才到他家找到他，以致延长了通话的时间。业务处物价科办事员陈宪宣于十一月十三日向汉口打加急电话一次，计时三十九分钟，需款八十二万五千元。十二月八日向天津打加急电话一次共三十九分钟，需款十五万六千元。按这些电话本来都是可以用普通电话即能解决问题的，同时在讲话前也未曾作充分准备，致使时间拖延很长。储运处运输科办事员朱世湘于十二月四日向济南叫加急电话，用时四十二分，需款四十六万二千元。他挂上加急电话后，自己不进行讲话，竟委托新来的某同志代讲，结果把事情未交代清楚，并延长了通话时间。
    对上述问题，我们已经进行了检讨和处理，并决定今后各处科向外叫长途电话，一律应由正副科长负责。需要超过三次或需加挂加急电话时，应经处长允许。在实行严格的管理制度以来，本公司从十月份开支电报电话费三万九千多单位（每单位一千五百元），十一月份仅开支一万二千个单位。这说明了我们在使用长途电话、电报上过去大部分都是浪费。
                中国煤业建筑器材公司
              一九五○年十二月十八日
