　　Welcoming 1951
    Li Jishen
    1950 has passed. In the past year, our country has made significant and brilliant achievements in politics, economy, military affairs, and diplomacy, and all undertakings have been carried out victoriously according to planned schedules. The internal and external environment of the past year has undergone more changes than in the past hundreds or even thousands of years. The old face of the Chinese nation is disappearing, and a brilliant new country has already possessed a thriving foundation. This is something that we can be pleased and excited about. At the same time, we can also imagine that our current situation is by no means accidental. Our achievements should be affirmed as primarily due to the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the great and brilliant leader, Chairman Mao, which has enabled the deeply suffering Chinese nation to be free from the long-term and brutal rule of feudalism, imperialism, and bureaucratic capitalism. Secondly, only in a country where the people have seized power can everything be done well. "Slaves who break free from their chains are the bravest," once the three thousand years of oppressed are liberated, even if they encounter any thorns and obstacles, they can persevere in the struggle with unparalleled perseverance and determination, and they will definitely be able to overcome all kinds of difficulties and obstacles and strive for the expected victory.
    Of course, we are not complacent about these past achievements and stop making great strides forward. When calculated against the distant goal of humanity striving towards a communist society, our existing achievements are still limited. As Chairman Mao said: today we have only completed the first step of the Long March of ten thousand miles, and all construction and development are still at the beginning. More arduous struggles are still ahead. We will neither be impatient nor hesitate, but we will go step by step, removing the ruggedness and stepping onto the broad road. This is an essential step. We must work hard with the confidence and determination to carry on the past and open up the future, to complete any arduous tasks assigned by history.
    Regarding the current internal and external situation, we must adhere to and unremittingly implement the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, protect our homes and defend our country. The US imperialist aggression against Korea is a preliminary step in a planned enslavement of China and the world. The growth and prosperity of people's democratic countries is deeply resented and hated by imperialism. The actions of the US imperialists today are a re-enactment of the history of imperialist intervention in the Soviet revolution thirty-three years ago. The experience and lessons of the revolution tell people that as long as we resolutely and unyieldingly fight, the invaders will inevitably suffer a crushing defeat. The current decline of the enemy in Korea proves that the righteous resistance of the Chinese and Korean people is the most effective and straightforward way to stop war and safeguard peace. However, it is unlikely that imperialism will willingly accept defeat. It will certainly try every crazy, adventurous, and conspiratorial method to attempt a comeback and expand its aggression. Therefore, we should be vigilant. Before the US imperialists have completely withdrawn from Korea and Taiwan, our territorial sovereignty is still under threat and violation. We cannot easily believe any of the lies and slanders of the US imperialists. Until the Korean issue is fairly and reasonably resolved, our movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea cannot be stopped for a single day.
    The movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea is inseparable from the work of revolutionary nation-building. As we begin 1951, we should examine how we can consolidate our advantages and expand our victories from the existing foundation. The direction of our future efforts and political tasks is of course combined with the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, protect our homes and defend our country:
    First, we must strengthen national defense construction and actively support the just war of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. Regarding the army, the People's Liberation Army, after long years of revolutionary war, is superior in quality to defeat the enemy. This is recognized worldwide. However, we still feel that our air defense and coastal defense capabilities are insufficient. To cope with the crisis of imperialism provoking new wars, we must step up the construction of the People's Air Force and the People's Navy, so that the new China's army, navy, and air force can develop equally to a superior level sufficient to defend the motherland and maintain world peace and security. At present, young workers and students across the country are responding to the government's call and enthusiastically participating in military cadre schools to enrich military cadre talents. This is a good phenomenon, which shows the people's support for their government's national defense construction and the guarantee of a bright future.
    Secondly, it is to consolidate the foundation of the people's democratic dictatorship. To maintain the victories we have gained, we must consolidate and expand the people's democratic united front, unite people of all nationalities and strata, and support the leadership of the People's Government and the Chinese Communist Party. And complete land reform according to the planned steps, thoroughly eliminate the feudal exploitation forces in the countryside, and raise the political consciousness of the broad masses of people. In addition, we should directly and indirectly help the government to eliminate bandits and special agents, so that all counter-revolutionaries cannot infiltrate the revolutionary ranks, and make them have no place to stand in the new society. If we all work hard in this way, we can consolidate social security and establish revolutionary order.
    In terms of economic construction, we must resolutely implement the policy of all-round consideration, restore and develop industrial and agricultural production with emphasis, so that rural society will become more prosperous day by day; and the future of industry will lay a solid foundation. In finance, we will continue to promote streamlining and thrift, and strive to maintain a balance between income and expenditure. In commerce, we will continue to protect legitimate business operations and crack down on speculation and profiteering, so as to stabilize prices and stabilize people's lives.
    In terms of cultural and educational construction, we should first focus on the propaganda and education that combines patriotism and internationalism, strengthen the people's confidence and determination to oppose imperialism, and widely and deeply carry out cultural and political learning movements to improve the people's cultural level and political awareness.
    These are the current urgent tasks of the government and the people, and also the most central political tasks of all democratic parties. At the end of 1950, the democratic parties separately held meetings in Beijing to review the past and encourage the future, and all had significant gains. And all the democratic parties paid special attention to the issue of combining consolidating the organization with developing the organization, in order to strengthen and expand the united front force. This is to meet the needs of completing the current political tasks. We should strive in this direction and strive to increase the huge construction force for the new China.
    1951 has begun. We must start from consolidating achievements, overcoming difficulties, and striving for progress, and work hard to move towards a bright and splendid future, and strive for the thorough and complete victory of the Chinese revolution.

　　迎接一九五一年
    李济深
    一九五○年已经过去。在过去的一年中，我们国家在政治、经济、军事、外交上，都有显著辉煌的成就，一切事业都能按照预定计划胜利地进行。一年来的内外环境，经历了比过去几百年甚至几千年更多的变化，中国民族的旧面貌正在消失，一个灿烂辉煌的新国家已经具备了欣欣向荣的基础，这是值得我们引为快慰和兴奋的。同时我们也想像得到的，我们今天的情况决不是出于偶然，我们的成就应肯定的说，首先是由于有中国共产党和伟大英明的领袖——毛主席的领导，才能使灾难深重的中华民族，解除了封建主义、帝国主义和官僚资本主义长期残酷的统治，其次，只有在人民已经掌握了政权的国家，才没有做不到做不好的事情。“奴隶挣脱了锁链，奴隶便是大勇者”，三千年的被压迫者一旦解放，即使遇着任何荆棘和阻碍，都可以用无比的毅力和决心，坚持斗争下去，一定是可以克服种种艰难险阻，争取预期的胜利。
    当然，我们今天并不以过去的这些成就引为自满而不向前再大大地推进。拿人类要努力于走向共产主义社会这个远大目标来计算，我们已有的成就，比较起来，还是有限的，这正如毛主席所说：我们今天不过是万里长征走完了第一步，一切建设和开拓还在起始，更艰巨的斗争还在后面，我们决不急躁也不迟疑，我们要一步一步地走去，扫除崎岖，踏上康庄，这是必经的步骤，我们要以继往开来的信心和决心，为完成历史所赋予的任何艰巨任务而努力。
    就今日内外情势说，抗美援朝保家卫国运动，我们必须坚持，贯彻不懈。美帝侵朝是有计划奴役中国和世界的初步，人民民主国家的壮大繁荣，是帝国主义所深恶痛嫉的，美帝今日的行动，是三十三年以前帝国主义干涉苏联革命的历史重演。革命的经验教训人们：只要我们坚决不屈的奋斗，侵略者必将遭致惨败，目前敌人在朝鲜的颓势，证明中朝人民的正义抗战，是制止战争保卫和平的最有效干脆办法。但帝国主义是很少可能就此甘心情愿地失败下去，他必定要想尽种种疯狂冒险和阴谋的方法企图卷土重来，扩大侵略。因此，我们应该警惕，在美帝没有完全退出朝鲜台湾以前，我们的领土主权是依然受着威胁与侵犯的，我们不能轻信美帝任何的谎语谰言，在朝鲜问题一日没有得到公平合理地解决以前，我们的抗美援朝运动便一日不能停止。
    抗美援朝运动与革命建国工作是分不开的，当着一九五一年开始的今天，我们应该检查一下，我们如何从已有的基础上，巩固优势扩大胜利。我们今后努力的方向和政治任务，当然是结合着抗美援朝保家卫国运动进行的：
    首先，我们要巩固国防建设和积极支援中国人民志愿部队的正义战争。就陆军说，人民解放军经过长期革命战争的锻炼，在质量上是具备了战胜敌人的优越条件，这是举世所承认的，但我们空防和海防实力犹感不足，为应付帝国主义挑拨新战争的危机，必须加紧建设人民空军和人民海军，使新中国的陆海空军同等的发展到足以保卫祖国维持世界和平与安全的优越境地。现在全国青年工人和青年学生们，响应政府号召，踊跃参加军事干部学校，以充实军事干部人才，这是很好的现象，也就是表示了人民对于自己政府国防建设的拥护和光明前途的保证。
    其次，是巩固人民民主专政的基础。为保持已得的胜利，必须巩固和扩大人民民主统一战线，团结各民族、各阶层人民，拥护人民政府和中国共产党的领导。并照预定步骤完成土地改革，彻底消灭农村中的封建剥削势力，提高广大人民的政治觉悟，此外我们还应直接间接地帮助政府肃清土匪特务，使一切反革命分子，不能钻入革命阵营，并且使其在新社会无立足余地。大家这样地努力做去，以巩固社会治安，确立革命秩序。
    在经济建设方面，要坚决执行四面八方政策，有重点地恢复并发展工农业生产，使农村社会，日见繁荣；工业前途，奠定稳固的基础。在财政上，继续推行精简节约，尽力维持收支的平衡。在商业上，继续保护合法经营，取缔投机倒把，以稳定物价，安定人民生活。
    在文教建设方面，首应注重爱国主义与国际主义结合的宣传教育，加强人民反对帝国主义的信心决心，广泛深入地展开文化学习与政治学习运动，以提高人民的文化水平及政治认识水平。
    这些都是政府与人民当前的紧急任务，也是各民主党派最中心的政治任务。在一九五○年末，各民主党派曾分别在京召开会议，检讨以往，策励未来，均有重大收获，而各民主党派特别注意于巩固组织与发展组织相结合的问题，以加强并扩大统一战线力量，这是适应于完成当前政治任务的需要，我们应朝此方向，努力奋斗，为新中国增加巨大的建设力量。
    一九五一年开始了，我们要从巩固成绩，克服困难争取进步出发，为走向远大灿烂的前途而努力，为中国革命的彻底完全胜利而奋斗。
