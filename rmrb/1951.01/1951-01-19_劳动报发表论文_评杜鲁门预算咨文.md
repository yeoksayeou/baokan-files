　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 18th: The Labor News published an article by Burnov on the 17th, commenting on Truman's economic message and budget message, stating that Truman had announced a policy of further engaging in an arms race and frantically preparing for a new war.

　　The author pointed out: The shameless war waged by the American aggressors against the Korean people has taken the sons of millions of American mothers. However, this is still not enough for those insatiable imperialist scoundrels.

　　Truman demands that taxpayers take out money, and at the same time, he is preparing to drastically reduce wages, ban strikes, force workers to perform labor, increase and raise taxes on farmers, and even tell all the people that he will reduce the already meager funding for public education, health, and other social needs.

　　The author continued: The arms expansion movement will cause inflation, greatly increase the cost of living, and reduce the manufacturing of many consumer goods. The arms expansion movement will create an unbearable burden on all people who live on wages and have stable incomes. In short, what Truman is giving the American people is a broad plan of hunger, poverty, and bloodshed.

　　Truman also believes that it is no longer necessary to be polite to his European vassal states. He threateningly warned them that from now on, they can only receive American support if they fulfill the obligations stipulated for them by the North Atlantic Alliance manipulated by the United States.

　　The author concluded: It is very clear that hidden in Truman's messages are despair, fear, and fragility. No matter what kind of neurosis American politicians develop, people like Forrestal, a madman who committed suicide by jumping off a building, will not find believers among the common people. Hundreds of millions of people in all countries demand: Stop the arms race! End the war hysteria and subdue those who are trying to launch a "total" war!

    评杜鲁门预算咨文
    【新华社十八日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：劳动报于十七日发表布尔诺夫的一篇论文，评论杜鲁门的经济咨文和预算咨文称，杜鲁门已经宣布了进一步进行军备运动和疯狂进行新战争准备的方针。
    作者指出：美国侵略者对朝鲜人民进行的无耻战争，已夺去了美国千万个母亲的儿子。但是，这对那些贪得无厌的帝国主义无赖们说来，还是不满足的。
    杜鲁门要求纳税人拿出钱来，同时，还在准备大量削减工资、禁止罢工、强迫工人服劳役、增添并提高农民方面的税赋，甚至向全体人民说，将减少已经少得可怜的公共教育、卫生与其他社会需要方面的经费。
    作者继称：扩军运动将引起通货膨胀，大大地提高生活费用，并减少许多消费品的制造。扩军运动将给全部靠薪资生活的人民中有稳定收入的人造成不能忍受的负担。简单说来，杜鲁门所给予美国人民的，是一个饥饿、贫穷与流血牺牲的广泛计划。
    杜鲁门也认为不必要再对他的欧洲仆从国家讲究礼貌。他威胁地警告它们说：从现在起，它们只有履行美国所操纵的北大西洋联盟给它们规定的义务，才能够得到美国的支持。
    作者的结语称：很清楚的，在杜鲁门的这些咨文里面隐藏着的是绝望、恐惧与脆弱。不论美国的政客们发什么神经，像已经跳楼自杀的疯子福莱斯特尔这样的人，在老百姓中间是找不到信徒的。各国千千万万的人民都要求：停止军备运动！结束战争歇斯底里，制伏那些试图发动“全面”战争的家伙！
