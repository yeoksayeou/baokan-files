　　The Heroic Deeds of Comrade Ding Youjun, a Youth League Member Posthumously Recognized as a Communist Party Member

　　The Xichang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Xikang Province has decided to posthumously recognize Ding Youjun, an outstanding member of the Communist Youth League, as an official Party member.

　　According to a circular issued by the Organization Department of the Southwest Work Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League: Comrade Ding Youjun was born in Wutongqiao, Leshan, Sichuan Province, nineteen years ago into a feudal family that favored sons over daughters. Before liberation, Comrade Ding Youjun studied at the Chengdu Municipal Girls' Middle School, high school division. After liberation, in January 1950, she enrolled in the Xikang People's Revolutionary Cadre School, concealing this from her family. She was an active student and joined the Chinese New Democratic Youth League in April. After graduating from the cadre school, she was assigned to work in youth affairs in the Xichang sub-district. After arriving at her post, Comrade Ding Youjun was able to obey the organization, endure hardship, and serve the people loyally.

　　On the morning of September 18th, Comrade Ding Youjun went to the countryside to help with grain requisition. She encountered bandits on the way and was captured. After being captured, the bandits used all kinds of cruel tortures to force her to surrender and submit, but Comrade Ding Youjun did not waver. She sternly condemned the bandits for their crimes of killing, arson, and harming the people. She also publicized the People's Government's policy of "the ringleaders must be punished, those who were coerced will not be questioned, and those who render meritorious service will be rewarded." These bandits showed no remorse and subjected Comrade Ding Youjun to bestial humiliation. That afternoon, they stripped Comrade Ding Youjun naked and paraded her through the streets. This barbaric act did not make Comrade Ding Youjun submit, but further strengthened her will for revolutionary struggle. She shouted revolutionary slogans and told the masses on the street: "Fellow villagers, this is not my shame, it is my glory. It is an honor for a revolutionary to die for the people. This glory is given by the Communist Party. It is these bandits who are despicable and shameless!" The next day, the bandits escorted Comrade Ding Youjun to a blockhouse guarded by the people's armed forces, demanding that she shout for the comrades inside to "surrender," or she would be shot on the spot. Comrade Ding Youjun shouted loudly: "Comrades, don't be afraid, be brave, stay calm, what good are small bandits! Comrades, persevere to the end, victory is ours!" This greatly encouraged their fighting will and confidence. They firmly replied: "Yes! We will definitely hold the blockhouse!" At this time, the bandits were infuriated and further threatened Ding Youjun to shout reactionary slogans. But Comrade Ding Youjun shouted: "Long live Chairman Mao, long live the Chinese Communist Party!..." At this point Comrade Ding Youjun was knocked to the ground by the bandits. But she still stubbornly shouted: "Comrades, don't be afraid, revolution requires bloodshed. It doesn't matter if I die, there will be thousands upon thousands of people who will avenge us!" The young Comrade Ding Youjun thus heroically sacrificed her life.

　　Although Comrade Ding Youjun participated in the revolution for a short time and received only a brief education in the New Democratic Revolution, she had already become an outstanding member of the New Democratic Youth League. In particular, her infinite loyalty to the people's cause and her spirit of heroically sacrificing her own life to protect the interests of the people in the face of the enemy. This is the noblest quality of a revolutionary.

　　The heroic sacrifice of Comrade Ding Youjun not only wrote a moving and inspiring page in the history of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, but also set an example of loving the motherland and loving the people for all Youth League members and revolutionary youth. The Xichang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has therefore decided to posthumously recognize Comrade Ding Youjun as a glorious Communist Party member.

　　一个被追认为共产党员的青年团员
    丁佑君同志的英勇事迹
    中共西康省西昌县委决定追认一个优秀的青年团员丁佑君为正式党员。
    据中国新民主主义青年团西南工作委员会组织部通报：丁佑君同志是四川乐山五通桥人，十九年前生于一个重男轻女的封建家庭。解放前，丁佑君同志在成都市立女子中学高中部学习。解放后，于一九五○年一月瞒过家庭考入了西康人民革命干部学校。学习积极；并在四月间参加了中国新民主主义青年团。在干部学校结业后，就被分配到西昌分区担任青年工作。丁佑君同志到工作岗位后，能够服从组织，吃苦耐劳，忠诚地为人民服务。
    九月十八日早晨，丁佑君同志下乡帮助征粮，途中遇到土匪，被土匪所俘。丁佑君同志被俘后，虽然土匪使用各种毒刑逼迫她投降，屈服；但丁佑君同志毫不动摇，严厉斥责土匪杀人放火残害人民的行为。并且给土匪宣传人民政府的“首恶者必办，胁从者不问，立功者受奖”的政策。这些土匪没有悔过之意，对丁佑君同志进行了兽性的侮辱。当日下午，将丁佑君同志衣服剥光后游街。土匪的这种兽行并没有使丁佑君同志屈服，更坚定了她的革命斗争意志。她高呼革命口号，并向街上的群众宣传：“老乡们，这不是我的耻辱，这是我的光荣。革命者能为人民死是光荣的。这种光荣是共产党给的。卑鄙无耻的就是这些土匪！”第二天，土匪将丁佑君同志押至一个人民武装守卫的碉堡前，要她喊叫里边的同志“投降”，否则就要当场枪毙，丁佑君同志就大声喊道：“同志们，不要怕，勇敢些，沉着气，小毛毛土匪有什么用！同志们要坚持到底，胜利是我们的！”这多么有力地鼓舞了对方的战斗意志与信心。他们坚决地回答道：“对！我们一定守住碉堡！”这时土匪气得发昏，进一步的威胁丁佑君呼喊反动口号。但是丁佑君同志喊出的是：“毛主席、中国共产党万岁！……”这时丁佑君同志被土匪击倒在地上了。但她仍旧顽强地高呼着：“同志们，不要怕，革命就是要流血的。死我一个算不了什么，还会有千千万万的人替我们报仇！”年青的丁佑君同志就这样壮烈牺牲了。
    丁佑君同志虽然参加革命历史很短，受新民主主义革命的教育不久；但她已成为一个出色的新民主主义青年团员。特别是她在敌人面前的这种对人民事业的无限忠诚，英勇牺牲自己生命，保卫人民利益的精神。这是革命者最高贵的品质。
    丁佑君同志的壮烈牺牲，不仅为中国新民主主义青年团的历史写下可歌可泣的一页，并且为全体青年团员和革命青年树立了爱祖国爱人民的典范。中共西昌县委因此决定追认丁佑君同志为光荣的共产党员。
