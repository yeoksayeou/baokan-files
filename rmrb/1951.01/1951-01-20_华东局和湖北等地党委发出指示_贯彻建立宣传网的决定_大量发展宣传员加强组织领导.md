　　The East China Bureau and Hubei and other local Party committees issue instructions
    Implement the decision to establish a propaganda network
    Vigorously develop propagandists and strengthen organizational leadership
    [Reported by this newspaper from Shanghai] The East China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued instructions on January 16 regarding the implementation of the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Establishing a Propaganda Network for the Masses of the People." The instructions pointed out: Party committees at all levels must use the greatest determination to overcome certain possible difficulties and obstacles, utilize all favorable conditions, and strive to quickly establish the organization and work of this propaganda network of great significance. The instructions emphasized that party committees at all levels must strictly implement the various working systems stipulated in the Central Committee's decision to strengthen the leadership of the party committee over the propaganda network for the masses: (1) Party committee secretaries at all levels must strictly implement the responsibilities for party propaganda activities stipulated in the Central Committee's decision. (2) Branch secretaries are the direct leaders of propagandists in their respective units and must hold propagandist meetings at least once a month or at most once a week. (3) The Party committees of urban and rural areas must be responsible for establishing and implementing a work system for leading the propagandists of each branch. The rural district party committees should especially establish a propagandist training station system to impart propaganda content and methods and distribute propaganda materials. (4) The city or county party committee must hold a joint meeting of branch secretaries or a meeting of propagandist representatives or a propagandist conference on a regular monthly basis. Under conditions of difficult transportation, the county committee may also convene meetings in one or several districts separately. (5) Strictly implement the reporting system of reporters or propagandists to the party committee for instructions and reports. (6) Party committees at all levels above the county (district), city, and county should establish a system to regularly provide propagandists with propaganda instructions and propaganda materials, and establish a distribution network to ensure that propaganda materials issued by higher authorities can be supplied in a timely manner. (7) Party committees at all levels above the county should report to higher levels on a regular basis on the ideological situation of the masses, their reactions to current events, policies, and tasks, as well as the situation and experience of propaganda work.
    East China has begun to establish propaganda networks. Currently, a large part of Shandong has moved from focusing on the pilot establishment of propagandists to the widespread establishment of propagandist organizations. In Yidu County, seven out of ten districts have established propaganda networks, with the establishment of district propaganda stations and township sub-stations, totaling thirty-seven propaganda groups and one hundred and seventy-nine propagandists. In the Qidong and Hai'an counties of the Nantong Special District of Northern Jiangsu, there are already one thousand and thirty-six propagandists. Shandong and other places have also widely used various forms of propaganda, such as blackboards, reading groups, radios, propaganda sheds, and exhibitions, to carry out propaganda activities, with great effectiveness. After the proposal to establish propagandists was put forward, agricultural labor models from all over the country actively participated in the work of propagandists. For example, Zhang Fugui, Yu Qingshou, Lü Hongbin, Li Duanlan, and Wang Li from Shandong are all determined to be good propagandists and take the lead in promoting production. Party committees in various places generally develop propagandists during various movements. Southern Jiangsu cultivated activists in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement as propagandists. The Propaganda Department of the Changzhou Prefectural Committee had piloted the establishment of a propaganda station in Tangxia Township, Yixing County, during the land reform movement. These propagandists all played a propaganda role in the land reform movement and promoted the development of the land reform movement. Southern Anhui and other places also developed and cultivated a large number of propagandists during the land reform movement.
    [Another News Item] The Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China instructed party committees at all levels on the 4th: (1) Party committees at all levels should conduct in-depth discussions and studies on the Central Committee's decision on establishing a propaganda network, and immediately carry out the work of establishing a propaganda network, striving to establish the propaganda network universally in rural areas within half a year and in urban areas within one or two months. (2) Propaganda networks (propagandists) in various places should be established during various movements. After the establishment of propagandists, the branch is responsible for leadership in both urban and rural areas. In places where branches have not yet been established, propagandists will be temporarily led by district committee members or work team leaders, trade unions, women's federations, and Communist Youth League cadres, and a propagandist training station can be set up for several townships. (3) A reporter system should be established in various places. At present, the party committees in Shashi, Nanzhang, Xiangyang and other places have begun to pay attention to and discuss propaganda work, and the party committee secretaries have made reports to the masses, which is a very good phenomenon. However, in the whole province, this is still very rare. The phenomenon of neglecting propaganda work and not discussing propaganda work still exists, and party committees in various places should resolutely correct this phenomenon. (4) It is the duty of party members to engage in propaganda work, and there are no special privileges. Its task is to connect with the masses, collect and reflect situations; under the organizational leadership of the Party, explain domestic and international current affairs, interpret policies and laws in a simple and popular form according to the specific local conditions at that time. In order to do a good job as propagandists, various places should hold propagandist meetings frequently to summarize work; and try to hold short-term training courses for propagandists for three or five days. (5) Establish a regular inspection and reporting system, with reports made every three days in cities and every five days in rural areas. Hold propagandist conferences or representative conferences on time, clarify the scope of activities, and conduct regular inspections and summaries. Counties and districts should strive to do this once a month. (6) Propaganda departments above the county and prefecture committee can compile propaganda manuals, but they must be combined with the specific local conditions and the current ideological situation of the masses to be used by propagandists.
    The Rehe Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a provincial committee meeting on the 8th of this month to discuss the decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the establishment of a propaganda network, and formulated a six-month work plan for implementing this decision. The plan put forward the following requirements: (1) The entire party should universally study this decision so that party committees at all levels and all party members can deeply understand the spirit of this decision and deeply recognize that doing propaganda work is a duty that every party member should fulfill. (2) Party member cadres in charge of leading organs of the provincial, county, and district levels of the Party, government, and people's organizations should serve as reporters and regularly make reports to the people. (3) Each branch should select two to three party members with high awareness, good study, close ties with the masses, and appropriate propaganda ability to be propagandists, and complete their preliminary training. (4) Improve the propaganda departments of the provincial, county, and district party committees and the propaganda and education departments of other systems, and train all propaganda cadres.
    According to the decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on establishing a propaganda network and the actual situation in Inner Mongolia, the Inner Mongolia Branch of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China instructed party committees at all levels to universally establish the organization of the propaganda network in areas with a foundation in party and Communist Youth League work before August, and in pastoral areas before December; if necessary, it can be carried out slightly later depending on the specific situation. However, all places should universally establish propaganda organizations during the movement to Resist America, Aid Korea, Defend the Home, and Defend the Country. The organizational leadership of some temporary propagandists in the past should be strengthened.
    According to incomplete statistics from the Propaganda Department of the Inner Mongolia Branch of the Communist Party of China, nearly 4,000 propagandists have been established in various parts of Inner Mongolia, and various propaganda activities have been carried out in the movement to Resist America, Aid Korea, Defend the Home, and Defend the Country, which has improved the political awareness and patriotic enthusiasm of the masses. However, there are still many shortcomings in propaganda work. The main problem is that the understanding of propaganda work is insufficient, and some areas regard this great long-term political task as a temporary and intensive task.
    After making a preliminary study of the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Establishing a Propaganda Network for the Masses of the People," the Xinzhou Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China in Shanxi Province instructed party committees at all levels on the 5th to convene standing committee meetings to seriously discuss this decision. The instructions also pointed out the following two points based on the specific situation of the Xinzhou Prefecture: (1) In the past, because everyone's understanding of the work of propagandists was not clear enough, the conditions for propagandists were stipulated very generally, so that some of the propagandists developed by the counties did not meet the requirements in the decision of the Central Committee; at the same time, party committees at all levels lacked planned leadership and training for these propagandists in the past. These should all be adjusted and improved. (2) In villages and party rectification training classes where cadres above the district committee directly lead the work, positive activists should be carefully selected in the movement to serve as propagandists in a planned manner, but it is necessary to prevent the tendency of being famous but not real, and padding the numbers.

　　华东局和湖北等地党委发出指示
    贯彻建立宣传网的决定
    大量发展宣传员加强组织领导
    【本报上海讯】中共中央华东局已于一月十六日发出关于执行中共中央《关于在全党建立对人民群众的宣传网的决定》的指示。指示中指出：各级党委必须用最大的决心，克服某些可能遇到的困难和障碍，利用一切有利条件，争取迅速建立这一有重要意义的宣传网的组织和工作。指示中着重指出：各级党的委员会必须严格执行党中央决定中规定的各种工作制度，以加强党委对人民群众的宣传网的领导：（一）各级党委书记必须严格执行中央决定中规定的对党的宣传活动所负的责任。（二）支部书记是各该单位中宣传员的直接领导者，至少每月最多每周须召开宣传员会议一次。（三）城市与农村区的党的委员会必须负责建立与执行领导各支部宣传员的工作制度。农村的区党委会尤应建立宣传员传授站的制度，传授宣传内容与方法及分发宣传资料。（四）市或县的党的委员会必须每月定期召开一次支部书记联席会议或宣传员代表会议或宣传员大会。在交通困难条件下，亦可由县委会分别在一区或数区召开。（五）严格执行报告员或宣传员对党委的请示报告制度。（六）各省（区）、市、地方、县党的委员会应订出制度，经常供给宣传员以宣传指示与宣传资料，并建立发行网，保证连同上级发下的宣传资料能够及时供应。（七）县以上各级党的委员会应按期向上级报告人民群众各种思想情况与对时事、政策、任务的反映，以及宣传工作的情况与经验。
    华东各地已开始建立宣传网。现山东已有大部地区由重点试建宣传员到普遍建立宣传员组织。益都县十个区中，即有七个区建立宣传网，成立了区宣传站和乡分站，共有三十七个宣传小组，一百七十九个宣传员。苏北南通专区启东和海安两县已有宣传员一千零三十六人。山东等地并广泛利用了黑板报、读报组、收音机、宣传棚、展览会等各种各样的宣传形式，进行宣传活动，收效很大。在提出建立宣传员后，各地农业劳动模范纷纷参加宣传员工作，例如山东张富贵、于青绶、吕洪斌、李端兰、王力等，都决心做一个好宣传员；并带头推动生产。各地党委一般是在各种运动中发展宣传员，苏南将抗美援朝运动中的积极分子培养为宣传员。常州地委宣传部曾在宜兴县棠下乡土地改革运动中试建宣传站。这些宣传员在土地改革运动中都发挥了宣传作用，推动了土地改革运动的展开。皖南等地也在土地改革运动中发展与培养了大批宣传员。
    【又讯】中共湖北省委会于四日指示各级党委称：（一）各级党委应对中央关于建立宣传网的决定，进行深刻的讨论与研究，并立即进行建立宣传网的工作，争取农村在半年内、城市在一、二月内都能将宣传网普遍建立起来。（二）各地宣传网（员）应当在各种运动中建立。宣传员建立后，在城市及农村中，均由支部负责领导。尚未建立支部的地方，宣传员暂由区委委员或工作组长，工会、妇会、青年团干部负责领导，并可以几个乡设一个宣传员传授站。（三）各地应建立报告员制度。目前沙市、南漳、襄阳等地党委已开始重视与讨论宣传工作，党委书记并已向群众做报告，这是很好的现象。但在全省来说，这还是很少的。忽视宣传工作，不讨论宣传工作的现象仍存在，各地党委应切实纠正这种现象。（四）担任宣传工作乃是党员的天职，决无什么特权，其任务为：联系群众，收集与反映情况；在党的组织领导下，根据当时当地具体情况，用简单通俗的形式，讲解国内外时事，解释政策、法令。为了作好宣传员工作，各地应经常召开宣传员会议，总结工作；并尽量的举办宣传员的三、五日的短期训练班。（五）建立定期检查汇报制度，城市三日乡村五日汇报一次，按时召开宣传员大会或代表会，分清活动范围，定期检查总结，县区要作到一月一次。（六）县委地委以上宣传部都可编写宣传手册，但必须结合当地具体情况，当地当时的群众思想情况，以供宣传员之用。
    中共热河省委于本月八日召开省委会议，讨论中共中央关于建立宣传网的决定，并制订了实施这一决定的半年工作计划。计划中提出如下要求：（一）全党应普遍学习这一决定，以便各级党委和全体党员深刻地领会这一决定的精神，深刻认识作宣传工作是每一个党员应尽的义务。（二）省县区三级党政民等领导机关的党员负责干部，应担任报告员，经常向人民群众作报告。（三）每个支部应选择觉悟高学习好与群众有密切联系并有适当的宣传能力的党员二人至三人为宣传员，并完成其初步训练。（四）健全省、县、区党委宣传部门及其他系统的宣教部门，并将宣传干部训练一遍。
    中共中央内蒙分局根据党中央建立宣传网的决定及内蒙实际情况，指示各级党委应在有党、团工作基础的地区，八月前普遍建立起宣传网的组织，游牧区可在十二月前建立起；必要时可根据具体情况稍迟进行。但各地应在抗美援朝保家卫国运动中，普遍建立起宣传组织来。对于过去一些临时性的宣传员，应加强组织领导。
    据中共内蒙古分局宣传部不完全统计，内蒙各地现已建立起宣传员近四千人，在抗美援朝保家卫国运动中，进行了各种宣传活动，提高了群众的政治觉悟和爱国热情。但在宣传工作中还存很多缺点，主要的对宣传工作认识不够，有些地区把这一伟大长期的政治任务，当成了临时的突击性的任务。
    中共山西忻县地委对中共中央《关于在全党建立对人民群众的宣传网的决定》作了初步研究之后，即于五日指示各级党委应召开常委会议，认真讨论这一决定。指示中并根据忻县专区具体情况，指出以下两点：（一）过去由于大家对于宣传员工作不够明确，所以宣传员的条件规定得很笼统，以致各县已发展的宣传员中，有一些是不符合党中央决定中所要求的；同时各级党委过去对这些宣传员缺乏有计划的领导与训练。这些都应加以调整与改进。（二）有区委以上干部直接领导工作的村庄及整党训练班，应有计划地慎重地在运动中挑选积极分子担任宣传员，但要防止产生有名无实，滥竽充数的偏向。
