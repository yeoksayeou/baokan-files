　　Peasants Love New Farm Tools After Liberation

　　Editor's Note: After the land reform, the vast number of peasants, who were completely liberated from feudal shackles, have become increasingly interested in and demanding the improvement of technology and the increase of production based on labor mutual aid and development of production. Therefore, the reform of agricultural production tools and the promotion of new farm tools have become a major issue. Moreover, under the planned leadership of the government, many achievements were made in the old liberated areas last year.

　　The production mutual aid group led by Yang Xianting, a national agricultural labor model in Keshan County, Heilongjiang Province, saved more than 900 man-days throughout the year by leading a full set of Soviet-style horse-drawn farm tools. The yield per hectare was about twice as high as others. The Tian Zhenghua mutual aid group in Xiaoye Village, Gaoping County, Shanxi Province, increased the efficiency of weeding and hoeing by two times due to the improvement of the weeding hoe. Therefore, the peasants in the old liberated areas are very interested in new farm tools and advanced farming methods. As Li Shunda, a national agricultural labor model, said in his letter, "The old peasant idea of 'planting depends on people, harvesting depends on heaven' has been changed in our area." In the new liberated areas, the liberated peasants have also raised demands for new farm tools. The letter from Wu Qifan in Ningshuo County, Ningxia, is a manifestation of the masses' wishes. Therefore, the government's promotion of new farm tools in the future should be strengthened on the basis of the existing work last year, with the increasing demands of the masses.

　　National Agricultural Labor Model Yang Xianting Mutual Aid Group
　　Using New Farm Tools Doubles Grain Harvest

　　The model production mutual aid group led by Yang Xianting, a national agricultural labor model in Minli Village, Keshan County, Heilongjiang Province, achieved excellent production results last year. Keshan County suffered a drought last year, with a general yield of only two *shi* per hectare, and a maximum of three *shi*; however, the Yang Xianting mutual aid group averaged five *shi* and four *dou* per hectare.

　　Why did the Yang Xianting mutual aid group cultivate the land so well? In addition to Yang Xianting's good leadership, their planned work, reasonable work point recording, and appropriate allocation of manpower and animal power, there was also a major factor: they used new farm tools. Last spring, their group received a full set of Soviet-style horse-drawn farm tools such as seeders, weeding machines, harvesters, and chaff cutters. Using these new farm tools for cultivation saved 40 to 50 percent of manpower and animal power compared to using the original farm tools. Women used the chaff cutter to cut grass, and the men's hands were not occupied by cutting grass all summer. Throughout the year, the group saved more than 900 man-days.

　　When they first received the new farm tools last year, many people doubted "they are not easy to use, we don't know how to use them." Now everyone is envious, and some people are asking to join the Yang Xianting mutual aid group, hoping to borrow new farm tools.

　　Letter from Labor Model Li Shunda
　　Xigou Village Peasants Love New Farm Tools
　　To the Editor:

　　In Xigou Village, Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, 19 out of 20 households in the village are organized for mutual aid production. Before the war, the average grain yield per mu was 1.39 *shi*. Last year, the yield per mu was 2.37 *shi*. The total grain yield of 240 *mu* of land increased by 235.2 *shi*, exceeding the pre-war production level by 63.3 percent.

　　The reason why our village's production has developed is that everyone has land after the land reform; it is because we earnestly implemented the policy of voluntary mutual benefit and equivalent exchange in mutual aid production, so that the policy of combining organization with new technology has gradually become the practical action of the masses. The number of applications of fertilizer and weeding has almost doubled compared to before the war. The implementation of seed soaking, seed mixing, and seed selection has resulted in the elimination of pests and the protection of seedlings, as well as drought resistance and increased production.

　　The old peasant idea of "planting depends on people, harvesting depends on heaven" has been changed here. Peasants are very interested in new farm tools and advanced farming methods. I took the lead in promoting new farm tools such as the two-legged seeder, the single-handle plow, and the liberation-style weeding hoe, which greatly saved labor. Using the liberation-style weeding hoe, three people can weed ten *mu* of land in a day, which is equivalent to twenty man-days, so many people are asking to buy it. Since then, the masses feel that they cannot afford to buy it alone, and their enthusiasm for organizing has become even higher. Last summer, the provincial government awarded 1,000 *jin* of millet, which was used to buy new farm tools such as threshers; at the provincial and national labor model representative conferences, we won the honorary title of model group and model village, and received many prizes—three single-handle plows, three sprayers, two threshers, and one chaff cutter, which greatly encouraged the masses' enthusiasm for organizing.

　　Tian Zhenghua Mutual Aid Group Uses New-Style Hoe
　　Weeding Efficiency Increased Twofold

　　Tian Zhenghua, the secretary of the Communist Party branch and the leader of the production mutual aid group in Xiaoye Village, Gaoping County, Shanxi Province, is a new type of rural youth. He is 25 years old this year and has been a cadre in the village since he was 19. He is enthusiastic, responsible, and has a creative spirit. In the mutual aid group he leads, he pays attention to research and improvement in seeds, fertilizers, pest control, and farm tools. They use drugs to mix wheat seeds, and they conduct field seed selection for both autumn and summer crops, and promote this method to the whole village. When weeding seedlings last autumn, they discovered the stem borers that were biting the millet seedlings. The group members pulled back the bitten millet seedlings and displayed them in the street, explaining the reasons for the death and injury of the millet seedlings, and mobilized the whole village to eliminate pests. In the past, everyone dared not use chicken manure on the land, saying that using chicken manure would breed insects. The Tian Zhenghua mutual aid group took the lead in experimenting. They dug a pit, sprinkled some lime in the pit, poured in chicken manure, added some water, and covered the manure. After a few days, they took it to the land. The wheat sown with chicken manure last autumn grew black and fat. Once, Tian Zhenghua saw in the Shanxi Daily that a village in Xiangyuan had made a weeding hoe that was labor-saving and efficient. Everyone read the news over and over again, and wanted to make one themselves according to the model. At this time, it happened that the blacksmith Li Xiaozui returned from blacksmithing outside. He had also seen this new-style hoe outside, and he suggested further improving it and creating a new style. Li Xiaozui had been doing blacksmithing for more than 20 years, and was a famous skilled craftsman. Everyone agreed with his opinion. At this time, it was the autumn harvest, so the mutual aid group helped Li Xiaozui with the autumn harvest and wheat planting, so that he could concentrate on making the new hoe. Li Xiaozui first designed the style, and after everyone made suggestions and constantly improved it, a more suitable weeding hoe was finally successfully created. Using it for weeding, three people can weed nine *mu* a day, while using the old hoe, one person can only weed one *mu* at most. Last November, Tian Zhenghua and Li Xiaozui participated in the county labor model conference, and their weeding hoe was constantly praised during the exhibition. Li Xiaozui also remodeled the plow surface and plowshare of the new-style single-handle plow they bought from the county to make it more suitable for the use of small pieces of land. Recently, they are also designing a new type of wheat harvesting sickle.

　　Liberated Peasants in Ningshuo County, Ningxia
　　Hope to Introduce New Farm Tools
　　To the Editor:

　　Here we have a vast area with a sparse population and a relative lack of labor. Cultivation requires livestock and good farm tools. But since we are close to the "Alxa Banner," which produces livestock, it is not difficult to solve the problem of draft animals. The difficulty lies in farm tools.

　　In the past, due to the cruel exploitation of the Ma Bufang bandits, with taxes and forced labor, the people were impoverished, resulting in a shortage of labor and reduced productivity. Since liberation, young people have returned to their homes, and the government has called for increased production. In addition, the land reform has been successfully completed, so the demand for the improvement of farm tools is even more urgent. Therefore, I suggest that relevant agencies promote and introduce more new farm tools or improved farm tool methods in order to improve agricultural technology and increase production.

　　翻身后的农民热爱新式农具
    编者按：经过土地改革，由封建束缚下彻底解放了的广大农民，在劳动互助发展生产的基础上，对于改进技术提高生产的兴趣和要求日益增长，因此农业生产工具的改革和新农具的推广，已经是一件重大的事情；并且在政府有计划领导下，去年在老区也收到了不少成绩。
    黑龙江克山县全国农业劳动模范杨显亭领导的生产互助组，因为领导了全套苏联式马拉农具，去年全年全组十四个半劳动力共节省九百多人工，且每垧地的产量较别人约增加一倍。山西高平县小野村田正华互助组，由于改进了耘耨锄，锄地效率提高两倍。因此老区农民们对新式农具和先进耕作方法感到很大兴趣，正如全国农业劳动模范李顺达信上说的：“种在人，收在天”这种农民的守旧思想，在我们已经改变了。在新区，翻身农民同样也已经提出了对新式农具的要求。宁夏宁朔县吴启帆的来信，就是群众愿望的表现。因此今后政府对新式农具的推广，应在去年既有的工作基础之上，随着群众要求的日益增长而加强。
    全国农业劳动模范杨显亭互助组
    使用新式农具粮食多收一倍
    黑龙江省克山县民立村，全国农业劳动模范杨显亭领导的模范生产互助组，去年得到优异的生产成绩。去年克山县遭了旱，一般的每垧地只打两石，最多到三石；但是杨显亭互助组平均每垧地打五石四斗。
    杨显亭互助组的地为什么种得这样好呢？这除了杨显亭领导的好，他们做活有计划，记工合理，适当地调配人力和畜力等办法以外，还有一个主要的条件，是他们使用了新式农具。去年春天，他们组领到了播种机、除草机、收割机、切草机等全套的苏联式马拉农具。他们使用这些新式农具耕种，较使用原来的农具，人畜力可节省百分之四十至五十。妇女使用切草机切草，一夏天没因切草占男人的手。一年中，全组共节省了九百多个人工。
    去年他们初领到新式农具时，很多人都怀疑“不好使，不会使”。现在大家都看得眼馋了，有些人要求参加杨显亭互助组，希望贷给新式农具。
    劳动模范李顺达来信
    西沟村农民热爱新式农具编辑同志：
    山西平顺县西沟村，全村二十户中有十九户组织起来互助生产。战前每亩地平均产粮一·三九石，去年每亩产粮二·三七石，全村二四○亩地共多打粮二三五·二石，超过战前生产水平百分之六三·三。
    俺村生产所以得到发展，是因为实行土地改革后人人有了土地；是因为在互助生产中认真的执行了自愿两利等价交换的政策，使组织起来与新的技术相结合的方针，逐渐变成了群众的实际行动。施肥和锄地的遍数，较战前差不多增加一倍。实行浸种、拌种、调选种的结果，既能除虫保苗，又能抗旱增产。
    “种在人，收在天”这种农民的守旧思想，在我们这里已经改变了。农民们对新式农具和先进的耕作方法感到很大兴趣。我带头推广两条腿耧、单把犁、解放式耘锄等新式农具，大大节省了人工。使用解放耘锄，三个人一天锄十亩地，能顶二十个人工，所以很多人都要求购买。从此，群众感到单干买不起，对组织起来的劲头更高了。去年夏天，省府奖给小米一千斤，买来脱粒机等新农具；在全省和全国劳动模范代表会议上，获得模范组模范村的光荣称号，得了许多奖品——单把犁三张、喷雾器三架、脱粒机两架、铡草机一架，更大大鼓舞了群众对组织起来的积极性。

    田正华互助组使用新式锄
    锄草效率提高了两倍
    山西高平县小野村中共支部书记兼生产互助组组长田正华，是一个新型的农村青年。他今年二十五岁，十九岁就在村里当干部，工作热情负责，富有创造精神。在他所领导的互助组里，在种籽、肥料、防害以及农具上，都注意研究和改进。他们种麦子用药物拌种，无论秋夏作物，都进行田间选种，并把这种方法推广到全村。在去秋锄苗时，他们发现了咬死谷苗的钻心虫，组员们把咬坏的谷苗拔回，在当街展览，向大家讲解谷苗死伤的道理，发动全村消灭害虫，过去大家都不敢用鸡粪上地，说用鸡粪会生虫。田正华互助组就首先进行试验，他们挖上一个土坑，坑里撒些石灰，倒进鸡粪，加些水，把粪闷上，过几天拿去上地。去秋他们用鸡粪试种的麦子，麦苗长的又黑又肥。有一次，田正华在山西日报上看襄垣某村制出一种耘锄，使用省力又出活。大家把这消息一遍又一遍的看了，就想按样子自己来打一个。这时恰遇打铁工人李小嘴自外打铁回来，他在外边也见过这种新式锄，他提议自己再改进一步，创造个新样子。李小嘴干了二十多年铁活，是有名的细工能手，大家很赞成他的意见。这时正遇收秋，互助组就帮助李小嘴收秋、种麦，让他专心一意造新锄。李小嘴先设计了样式，经过大家提出意见，不断改进，更适用的耘耨锄终于创造成功了。使用它锄地，三个人一天可以锄九亩，而使用旧锄，一个人一天顶多才能锄一亩；去年十一月，田正华和李小嘴参加了全县劳动模范大会，他们的耘耨锄在展览时不断受到称赞。李小嘴还曾把他们从县里买回的新式单把犁的犁面和犁铧改造，更适合于小片土地的运用。最近，他们又在设制一种新的割麦镰刀。
    宁夏宁朔县翻身农民
    希望介绍新式农具编辑同志：
    我们这里地广人稀劳力较缺乏，耕作上很需要畜力和好的农具。但这里接近出产牲畜的“阿拉善旗”，所以耕畜倒不难解决，困难的还是农具。
    过去由于马匪鸿逵残酷的榨取，抽税、拉丁，民不聊生，以致劳动力缺乏，生产力降低。自解放后，青壮年重返家园，政府号召提高生产，再加上土地改革已将胜利完成，因此对农具的改善要求更为迫切。所以我建议有关机关多多推广和介绍些新式农具或改良农具的方法，以求改进农业技术，提高生产。
