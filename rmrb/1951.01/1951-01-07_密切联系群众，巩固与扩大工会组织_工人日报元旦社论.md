　　Editor's Note: The Worker's Daily, the organ of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, published a New Year's editorial calling for close ties with the masses and the consolidation and expansion of trade union organizations. This is an important call to action for trade unions across the country. We are now reprinting the parts concerning the state of trade union work in 1950 and future directions as follows:

　　In 1950, our national trade union work also achieved many successes. Workers and staff in all major industrial sectors and important cities across the country have been basically organized, with over 4.9 million members, becoming a powerful pillar of the People's Government. In order to transform bureaucratic capitalist enterprises into New Democratic people's enterprises, trade unions mobilized the broad masses of workers and staff to participate in the takeover of state-owned enterprises, thereby assisting the administrative side of state-owned enterprises in implementing the policy of democratic factory management; particularly in the coal mining, transportation and other industrial sectors, a widespread struggle against feudal headmen was launched; providing a new set of enterprise management methods and systems such as the establishment of factory management committees and transportation companies, greatly enhancing the sense of responsibility and labor efficiency of the working masses. Trade unions launched work such as establishing labor-management consultation meetings and signing collective contracts in private enterprises across the country, which not only played a significant role in overcoming temporary difficulties and maintaining production last March, but also proposed a set of specific methods for achieving mutual benefit for labor and capital under the New Democratic regime, becoming the best form for workers and capitalists to jointly strive to restore and develop production. In protecting the interests of the working class, trade unions first launched a movement to relieve unemployed workers across the country, promoting the spirit of working-class friendship, and at the same time requested the government to allocate a large amount of unemployment relief funds, so that the then-serious unemployment problem was quickly resolved. Over the past year, our trade unions have also assisted the government in drafting several major draft laws related to labor protection, such as the draft Factory Safety and Health Regulations and the draft Labor Insurance Regulations. Currently, 1.2 million workers across the country are enjoying the benefits of the National Labor Insurance Regulations, which will soon be trialed nationwide. In addition, trade unions have promoted spare-time education work across the country, organizing more than 700,000 workers and staff to regularly participate in vocational spare-time school studies, and have also achieved certain results in improving the political, cultural, and technical level of the broad masses of workers. The achievements of national trade union work are inseparable from the great significance of the Trade Union Law promulgated by the Central People's Government last year. The Trade Union Law stipulates the legal status and rights of trade unions in the New Democratic state and is one of the great fruits of the Chinese working class's thirty years of struggle under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. At the same time, the achievements of national trade union work are inseparable from the efforts of our trade union cadres at all levels across the country. Many cadres, unafraid of hard work, serve the workers wholeheartedly and serve the great cause of building a new China, and have won the trust and love of the working masses.

　　The achievements of Chinese trade union work over the past year are significant and worth pointing out. However, we must never be complacent because of this. It should be admitted that our trade union construction over the past year is only the beginning, and we still have many serious shortcomings. Although we have basically organized the broad masses of workers and staff in the major industrial sectors and important cities across the country, trade union organizations, especially grassroots trade union organizations, are not yet very sound; and the biggest shortcoming is that many of our trade union organizations and trade union cadres still have serious phenomena of being divorced from the masses. Secondly, the development of our trade unions across the country is not enough, and we have not yet organized the workers in the vast small and medium-sized cities. Therefore, how to closely link with the broad masses of workers and consolidate and expand trade union organizations has become the central task of our trade union construction in 1951.

　　Why has the phenomenon of being divorced from the masses occurred in our trade union organizations? This is primarily because some of our trade union cadres are not good at caring about the interests of the broad masses of workers. For example, in state-owned enterprises, the common tasks of the trade union and the administrative side are naturally to ensure the completion of the state production plan; however, some trade union cadres have therefore forgotten to care about the daily life interests of the working masses and turn a blind eye to the most urgent needs of the working masses. For some problems that must be solved and can be solved, they do not know how to stand on the specific position of trade union work, represent the working masses based on the government's labor laws and collective contracts, and proactively propose reasonable solutions to the administrative side. In private enterprises, individual trade union cadres are not only not good at caring about the interests of the working masses, but even replace capitalists in implementing "layoffs and salary reductions," openly speaking for capitalists. Therefore, in individual trade unions, the phenomenon of the masses not trusting the trade union and the trade union being divorced from the masses has occurred. It must be recognized that all trade union organizations and trade union cadres, on the one hand, should often conduct education among the working masses, explaining that developing production is the highest interest of the working class, whether in state-owned or private enterprises. However, on the other hand, they must closely care about the daily interests of the broad masses of workers, constantly listen to the voices of the broad masses of workers, actively suggest and urge the administrative side of public enterprises, and require the capitalists of private enterprises to accept the reasonable demands of the working masses and solve those problems that can be solved, in order to better fulfill the responsibility of assisting the administrative side in completing state tasks and uniting capitalists to improve production.

　　Secondly, it is because many cadres in our trade union leading organs and even grassroots organizations are still appointed. For the active elements that have emerged from the masses over the past year - those mass leaders who are truly connected with the broad masses and supported by the broad masses, they are considered to have no "ability" and no qualifications of "county committee" or "district committee" level cadres, and they dare not boldly promote them to the trade union leading organs. This is a fundamentally wrong view. It should be pointed out that all trade union organizations must be democratically elected by the masses from the bottom up. It is necessary to resolutely abolish the appointment system and the "qualification" viewpoint, and boldly promote active elements supported by the masses from the working masses to the trade union leading organs to participate in the leadership work of the trade union. Only in this way can the trade union organs be closely linked with the broad masses of workers without the danger of becoming "bureaucratic" organs.

　　Thirdly, some trade union organizations still lack various democratic life systems. Various meetings are not held on time, various issues related to the interests of the masses are not reported to the masses, not discussed by the masses, only a few people issue orders and act arbitrarily. This bureaucratic style naturally arouses dissatisfaction and opposition from the masses. After the trade union cadre rectification, although there have been some changes, it is still very incomplete. Especially regarding the trade union financial system, it has not been seriously established so far; some trade union organizations collect membership dues, neither do things for the masses nor report accounts to the masses, and there are even cases of corruption and waste, becoming one of the main reasons for being divorced from the masses and causing dissatisfaction among the masses. Therefore, all trade union organizations must strictly abide by the system of reporting work to the working masses on a regular basis, and must listen to the criticisms and suggestions of the working masses on their work at the general meeting of members or the congress of members' representatives. Trade union cadres should also conduct open criticism and self-criticism at the general meeting of members or the congress of members' representatives. Especially regarding the issue of trade union funds, it is necessary to implement strict financial systems and financial discipline in accordance with the decision of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions financial conference, especially to report income and expenditure accounts to the masses on a regular basis, and accept the strict examination of trade union funds by the masses. These are necessary systems for consolidating the trade union and closely linking with the working masses, and must be strictly and seriously established.

　　Fourthly, a few of our trade union organizations and trade union cadres still have the style of coercion and commandism and paternalism. For example, during the trade union re-election at the Wudong Railway Factory, the cadres sent by the branch monopolized the election and insisted that the masses elect the people who had been trained and transferred back, arousing widespread dissatisfaction among the masses. The result of this monopoly by a few people is that the trade union committee members become a mere formality. Many committee members who are elected by the masses and not divorced from production do not even know what their division of labor is because of this situation. There are also some trade union cadres who only know how to sit in the office and rely on issuing orders to do things, and after work, they return to their dormitories, which are far away from the workers' dormitories, and they do not see the working masses all day long. In individual places, the serious phenomenon of the masses petitioning the trade union has even formed due to this coercive commandism and paternalistic work style, which is extremely inappropriate. Therefore, it must be emphasized again that democracy is the soul of the trade union! All trade union cadres must integrate with the broad masses of workers, must live among the broad masses, must humbly listen to the opinions of the working masses, be good at consulting with the working masses, and be good at organizing the strength of the broad masses of workers themselves to solve their own problems. Only in this way can the trade union truly become the organization of the broad masses of workers themselves, and can it promote the broad masses of workers to consciously and voluntarily contribute great strength to national construction.

　　Our trade union organizations and trade union cadres can only closely link with the broad masses of workers by caring about the interests of the working masses at all times, implementing the democratic system of the trade union, and establishing a democratic style of believing in the masses, relying on the masses, and consulting with the masses in everything. At the same time, every trade union member must care for and cherish their trade union organization, and actively participate in various activities of the trade union; every trade union member and all workers and staff have the responsibility to supervise trade union cadres to care about the interests of workers and do a good job in trade union work. Only when the broad masses of workers rise up to supervise the work of trade union organizations and trade union cadres, and constantly use the weapon of criticism and self-criticism, can our trade union organizations achieve consolidation and development, truly become schools for uniting and educating workers themselves, and better play the role of trade union organizations under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, to greet the great combat tasks of national defense construction and economic construction in 1951.

### 密切联系群众，巩固与扩大工会组织——工人日报元旦社论

　　密切联系群众，巩固与扩大工会组织——工人日报元旦社论
    编者按：全国总工会机关报——工人日报元旦发表社论，号召密切联系群众，巩固与扩大工会组织，这是对于全国工会一个重要的号召。现特将其中有关一九五○年工会工作状况及今后方针部分转载如下：
    一九五○年，我们全国工会工作也是有不少成绩的。我们现在全国各主要产业部门和重要城市的职工，都已基本上组织起来了，共有四百九十余万会员，成为人民政府最有力的一个支柱。为了改造官僚资本企业为新民主主义的人民企业，工会动员了广大职工群众，参加了国营企业的接管工作，从而协助国营企业的行政方面，实行工厂管理民主化的方针；特别在煤矿、搬运等产业部门中，广泛展开了反对封建把头的斗争；提供了建立工厂管理委员会与搬运公司等一套新的企业管理办法与制度，大大提高了工人群众主人翁的责任感与劳动效率。工会在全国私营企业中，展开了建立劳资协商会议、订立集体合同等工作，这不仅在去年三月克服暂时困难、维持生产中起了重大作用，而且给新民主主义政权下的劳资关系上，提出了一套实现劳资两利的具体办法，成为工人与资方共同努力恢复与发展生产的最好的形式。工会在保护工人阶级利益方面，首先是在全国开展了一次救济失业工人运动，发扬了工人阶级友爱的精神，同时请求政府拨出了大批失业救济金，使当时相当严重的失业问题，很快的得到解决。一年来，我们工会还帮助政府起草了几个重大的有关劳动保护的法令草案，如工厂安全卫生条例草案、劳动保险条例草案等。现在全国已有一百二十万工人，享受着国家劳动保险条例的待遇，该条例不久即将在全国试行。此外，工会在全国推广业余教育工作，组织了七十多万职工经常参加职工业余学校学习，在提高广大工人群众的政治、文化、技术水平上，也收到一定的成绩。全国工会工作能够获得以上这些成绩，去年中央人民政府所颁布的工会法，是有特别重大意义的。工会法规定了工会在新民主主义国家中的法律地位与权利，是中国工人阶级三十年来在中国共产党领导下所获得的伟大胜利果实之一。同时，全国工会工作这些成绩的获得，是与我们全国各级工会干部的努力分不开的。有不少干部不怕辛勤劳苦，全心全意为工人服务，为建设新中国的伟大事业服务，而获得了工人群众的信仰和爱护。
    一年来，中国工会工作的这些成就是巨大的，值得指出的。但是，我们绝不可以因此而自满起来。应该承认，我们一年来的工会建设还只是开始，我们还有许多严重的缺点。我们虽然在全国各主要产业部门和重要城市中，已经把广大工人群众基本上组织起来，但是工会组织特别是工会基层组织还不很健全；而最大的缺点是：我们有不少工会组织与工会干部，还存在着严重的脱离群众的现象。其次，我们工会在全国的发展，也还不够，我们还没有把广大中小城市中的工人都组织起来。因此，如何密切联系广大工人群众，巩固与扩大工会组织，就成为我们一九五一年工会建设的中心任务。
    为什么我们的工会组织会产生脱离群众的现象呢？这首先是由于我们有些工会干部，还不善于关心广大工人群众的利益。比如在国营企业中，工会与行政方面的共同任务，自然都是为了保证国家生产计划的完成；但是，有些工会干部却因此忘记了关心工人群众日常生活的利益，对于工人群众最迫切的需要，熟视无睹。对于某些必须解决而又可能解决的问题，不知道站在工会工作的具体立场，根据政府的劳动法令与集体合同，代表工人群众，主动的向行政方面提出求得合理的解决。在私营企业中，有个别工会干部，不仅不善于关心工人群众的利益，甚至代替资本家实行“裁人减薪”，公开替资本家说话。因此，在个别工会中就发生群众不信任工会，工会脱离了群众的现象。必须认识：一切工会组织与工会干部，一方面固然应该经常在工人群众中进行教育，解释：不论在国营企业与私营企业中，发展生产都是工人阶级的最高利益。但是另一方面，必须密切关心广大工人群众的日常利益，经常倾听广大工人群众的呼声，积极的建议和督促公营企业的行政方面，要求私营企业的资方接受工人群众的合理要求，解决那些可能解决的问题，才能更好地尽到协助行政方面完成国家任务和团结资方搞好生产的责任。
    第二，是由于我们有许多工会领导机关以至基层组织中的干部，至今仍然是委派的。对于一年来群众中涌现的积极分子——那些真正与广大群众有联系，为广大群众所拥护的群众领袖，则认为他们没有“能力”，没有“县委”或“地委”级干部的资格，就不敢大胆把他们提拔到工会领导机关中来。这是一种根本错误的观点。应该指出：一切工会组织，必须要自下而上地由群众民主选举产生。必须坚决废除委派制与“资格”观点，大胆地从工人群众中提拔群众拥护的积极分子到工会领导机关中来，参加工会的领导工作。这样才能使工会机关与广大工人群众密切联系而不会有变成“官僚”机关的危险。
    第三，有些工会组织，还缺乏各种民主生活的制度。各种会议不按时举行，各种有关群众利益的问题，不向群众报告，不经群众讨论，只是少数几个人，发号施令，独断独行，这种官僚主义的作风，自然引起群众的不满和反对。经过工会干部整风以后，虽然有了一些转变，但还是很不彻底。特别是关于工会的经费制度，至今没有认真建立起来；有些工会组织收了会费，既不给群众办事，又不向群众报账，而且还发现有贪污浪费的情形，成为脱离群众、引起群众不满的最主要的原因之一。因此，一切工会组织都必须严格遵守定期向工人群众报告工作的制度，必须在全体会员大会或会员代表大会上听取工人群众对自己工作的批评与建议。工会干部并应经常在会员大会或会员代表大会上进行公开的批评与自我批评。特别是关于工会经费问题，必须按照全国总工会财务会议的决定，实行严格的财务制度和财政纪律，特别是向群众定期报告收支账目，接受群众对于工会经费的严格审查。这些都是巩固工会与工人群众密切联系的必要制度，必须严格地认真地建立起来。
    第四，我们还有少数工会组织与工会干部，至今仍然存在着强迫命令和包办代替的作风。例如武东铁路工厂在工会改选时，由分会派去的干部包办选举，硬要群众选上经过受训调回去的人，引起群众普遍的不满。这种由少数人包办的结果，使工会委员就成为形式。有许多由群众选出的不脱离生产的委员，就因为这种情形，连自己分工是做什么的都不知道。还有一些工会干部，只知道坐在办公室里靠发号施令办事，下班后回到自己的宿舍里，距离工人的宿舍又很远，成天与工人群众见不着面。有个别地方甚至因为这种强迫命令、包办代替的工作作风，形成群众向工会请愿等极不应有的严重现象。因此，必须再度强调指出：民主是工会的灵魂！一切工会干部，必须与广大工人群众打成一片，必须生活在广大群众之中，必须虚心倾听工人群众的意见，善于与工人群众商量，善于组织广大工人群众自己的力量，来解决工人群众自己的问题。只有如此，工会才能真正成为广大工人群众自己的组织，才能发扬广大工人群众自觉自愿的为国家建设贡献伟大力量。
    我们的工会组织与工会干部，只有时时刻刻关心工人群众的利益，实行工会的民主制度，树立相信群众、依靠群众、遇事与群众商量的民主作风，才能和广大工人群众密切联系起来。同时，每一个工会会员，也要关心与爱护自己的工会组织，积极参加工会的各种活动；每一个工会会员与全体工人职员群众，都有监督工会干部关心工人利益，做好工会工作的责任。只有广大工人群众起来，监督工会组织与工会干部的工作，经常运用批评与自我批评的武器，我们的工会组织，才能够达到巩固与发展，真正成为团结与教育工人自己的学校，在中国共产党的领导之下，更好地发挥工会组织的作用，迎接一九五一年伟大的国防建设与经济建设的战斗任务。
