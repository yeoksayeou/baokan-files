Xinhua News Agency, 16th dispatch: The invading American soldiers in Korea are filled with discouraged and pessimistic sentiments. According to Porter, a United Press reporter accompanying the American invading army's Second Division, when he saw American soldiers in the "trenches" on the 11th, "Everyone asked me: 'Are we going to stay in Korea forever?'" "Everyone expressed his personal desire to leave." When an officer believed that "politically and psychologically," the United States had "a big bet" in Korea, "Private First Class Volkes expressed what he thought was a more practical view of the situation. He said: It's no longer a question of whether to save face, but a question of whether to save our asses."

Valentine, a Reuters reporter accompanying the American invading army's Eighth Army, also revealed that distressed emotions are widespread among American soldiers. In a telegram he sent on the 14th, he said: "Everyone here seems distressed these days." Although "the general officers who bear the heaviest responsibility" put on an act of "stoic silence," "lower-ranking officers" have already "occasionally" "voiced dissatisfied complaints," while "the soldiers are full of complaints." Not only are American soldiers like this, but British soldiers, Thai soldiers, Dutch soldiers, and French soldiers are also full of complaints. The reporter said: Those "pent-up," "muttering, and disgruntled complaints" are "contagious," and even "non-military personnel have been infected." This pervasive complaining in the invading army makes one "feel that this is indeed a very miserable army." Valentine was detained for twelve hours by the American invading army authorities in Korea, who are stepping up censorship, for writing this "feature about American soldiers complaining," and was expelled from the American Eighth Army's base on the 14th.

　　侵朝美军沮丧悲观
    士兵都表示想离开朝鲜
    【新华社十六日讯】在侵朝美军士兵中，弥漫着沮丧悲观的情绪。据随美国侵略军第二师的合众社记者波特透露，他十一日在“战壕”里见到美军士兵时，“每个人都问我：‘我们是不是一直呆在朝鲜不走？’”“每个人都表示他个人是想离开的”。当一个军官认为“从政治上和心理上说”，美国在朝鲜“下的赌注很大”时，“一等兵佛尔克斯说出了他认为是对时局的更为实际的看法。他说：这不再是一件要不要保全面子的问题，而是一件要不要保全屁股的问题”。
    随美国侵略军第八军的路透社记者范伦汀亦透露，苦恼的情绪普遍地存在于美军士兵之中。他在十四日发出的一则电讯中说：“这里的每一个人这些天来似乎都感到苦恼”。尽管“担任最重责任的将级军官们”装出“苦乐不以为意的沉默”佛但是，“下级军官们”已是“偶然”“发出不满的怨言”，而“士兵们则怨声载道”。不但美国兵如此，英国兵、泰国兵、荷兰兵以及法国兵也都是满口怨言。该记者说：那些“发泄闷气的”、“嗫嚅的、不平的怨言”，“具有传染性”，甚至“非军事人员也被感染了”。侵略军队中这种弥漫着的埋怨情形，使人“觉得这确是一支很悲惨的军队”。范伦汀因为写了这篇《关于美军士兵发牢骚的特写》，被正在加紧实行新闻检查的侵朝美军当局扣押十二小时，并于十四日被逐出了美国第八军驻地。
