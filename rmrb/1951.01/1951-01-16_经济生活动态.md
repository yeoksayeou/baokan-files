    Dalian Railway Factory Eliminates Hot Axle Accidents

    According to the Production and Wage Department of the China Changchun Railway Committee: the locomotives manufactured by the Dalian Railway Factory in the first half of last year continuously experienced hot axle accidents, which affected the completion of production tasks. After in-depth research and inspection by Soviet expert Comrade Subaoqin, the quality of copper tiles was improved, and the locomotive was repaired. Trial runs at speeds of 35 to 36 kilometers per hour did not cause overheating, and even when the speed was increased to 65 to 70 kilometers per hour on the return trip, overheating did not occur, thus eliminating hot axle accidents.

    Dengkou Organizes Hui and Han People to Collect Sammi and Sand Onion

    The Dengkou County People's Government in Ningxia Province organized the Hui and Han people to engage in sideline production, collecting sammi (wild grass seeds in sandy areas, tastier than millet), sand onions, and digging licorice, which increased people's income.

From the beginning of November to mid-December last year, they collected more than 7,000 dan of sammi, more than double the amount of public grain turned in, exceeding the average agricultural income by more than one time per person. The Dengkou District organized 40 people to collect sand onions, collecting 60,000 jin, increasing income by 90 million yuan.

    Central South Stipulates Exemption of Temporary Commercial Tax for Farmers Selling Products

    According to the Hubei Daily news on January 11: In order to guarantee tax revenue, take care of the burden of farmers, fishermen, herdsmen, and hunters, and correct and prevent illegal merchants from falsely claiming to be farmers' self-produced products, colluding with village cadres to issue certificates, and sheltering tax evasion, the Central South Finance Committee issued the following decision on January 6: Farmers selling self-produced products, whose value reaches the starting point of 100,000 yuan for temporary commercial tax, must have a certificate from the village-level government in general market towns. When selling in cities (county towns and cities directly under the jurisdiction of the prefecture and above), this certificate must be stamped and certified by the tax authority above the resident tax office, and verified by the tax authority at the place of sale before the temporary commercial tax can be exempted.

    Rent Reduction Movement Fully Launched in Eastern Sichuan and Other Places

    The rent reduction movement has been fully launched in the vast rural areas of the four administrative regions of Eastern Sichuan, Southern Sichuan, Northern Sichuan, and Western Sichuan. Among them, the movement in Southern Sichuan is developing the fastest, and most rural areas in the region are nearing completion. In Northern Sichuan and Eastern Sichuan, according to incomplete statistics, more than 600 townships have completed rent reduction. Rent reduction in the suburbs of Chongqing has been fully completed. With the development of the rent reduction movement, farmers' associations in various places are also expanding rapidly. As of the end of last year, the four administrative regions had a total of more than 9.2 million members in farmers' associations, and self-defense forces organized by young farmers had reached 800,000.
