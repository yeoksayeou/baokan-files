    Telegraphing National Industrial and Commercial Circles to Express Determination to Unite Against America
    [Our Newspaper's News] Industrial and commercial circles in Changsha City and the industrial and commercial circles in Cheng Guan Town, Jixian County, Pingyuan Province, held anti-American and aid-Korea demonstration parades on December 15th and 26th of last year, respectively. In addition to formulating patriotic covenants, the industrial and commercial circles in both places telegraphed the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression, forwarding it to the national industrial and commercial circles, expressing their willingness to unite closely with the people of all circles across the country and participate in this just and great movement with practical actions.
    The telegram from the industrial and commercial circles in Changsha City stated: The imperialist aggression against China for more than a century, especially the crimes of American imperialism colluding with the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to invade our country, has completely educated us, making us recognize that American imperialism and its running dogs are the mortal enemies of national industry and commerce. The industrial and commercial circles in Changsha City also fervently hope that the national industrial and commercial circles will unite around the Chinese Communist Party and strive for final victory.
    The telegram from the industrial and commercial circles in Cheng Guan Town, Jixian County, Pingyuan Province stated: We are determined to work with the people of the whole country, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, to fight to the end to defend world peace, defeat American imperialist aggression, and build a prosperous and happy new China.
