　　Changes in My Family Over the Past Two Years
　　Bù Chūnshēng, Mathematics Teacher at Peimant Girls' Middle School

　　Two years ago, I was like a hibernating insect, burrowing into the soil to escape the severe cold. At that time, I didn't know if spring would come. I came from an exploiting class background, spent my university years at Yenching University, and taught at a missionary school. I had no courage to fight the cruel and cold reality. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, I returned home, shut the door, and became a housewife. My husband, Chen Jingyun, was a very honest and good doctor, and I agreed with his purely technical viewpoint. He supported the whole family, and I only took care of the children. At that time, I thought: It's better to be born a woman than a man, so I can hide at home and avoid that dirty society. I decorated the home very comfortably and even looked after three servants. Friends all said I was a good homemaker. The children were all like they had been disinfected. The oldest was eleven years old and wasn't allowed to go out without an adult escort, and there wasn't even any interaction with the neighbors. We didn't want to ask about politics, as if we were above everything. Although sometimes I felt depressed, I would just complain, and the next day I would continue living the same way without any change.

　　The drums of liberation awakened me like spring thunder. I walked out of the door, breathing in the warm air with the scent of spring grass. Ah! Everything was active! Young, red-faced Liberation Army soldiers lived in the alley where I lived. They loved the children, and the children loved them. I began to let the children out, and I also began to interact with the neighbors. Now, our home is gradually integrating with the outside world, and my eleven-year-old eldest child, Wentai, has also been approved as a candidate member of the Communist Youth League. Let me recall a touching fact! One night, Wentai lay in bed and suddenly called me to say, "Mom, do you know? Our school has now established a Young Pioneers team, and I have joined the Young Pioneers team." His eyes shone with happy light. He felt that this was very pleasant and glorious at his young age. He gave me encouragement and strength. The fervor of my student days was burning in me again! I read Ehrenburg's report on the First World Congress of Defenders of Peace in the People's Daily, and my heart burned to a white heat. From morning to night, a thought kept turning in my mind: "I want to fight fire too!" But at that time, Jingyun was studying in London, and I needed to take care of four children. So I decided to enrich myself first: reading some political and literary books, and later focusing on studying Chairman Mao's works. After not reading for ten years, I naturally had many problems that I couldn't solve myself. At this time, I met Comrade Zheng Defang. We were good friends before the war. After the July 7th Incident, she went to the liberated areas. Although there was a separation of twelve years, she had already built a tall building on flat ground, while my side was full of weeds and a desolate scene. But after we met, we were as familiar as we were twelve years ago. She gave me a lot of help. Through her, I further understood the Communist Party and accepted the Communist Party's propositions.

　　In February 1950, I left home and became a mathematics teacher at Peimant Girls' Middle School. This task made me very apprehensive, and I immediately studied hard and humbly. Comrade Wang Hongwen was a young teacher. In terms of age, she could almost be my daughter. She called me "Mom," but this "Mom" went to ask "daughter" for advice on everything. The Party in the school helped me a lot, often guiding me. When I and some comrades thought, "We don't have time to read more, it's really frustrating," the Party branch secretary, Comrade Tao Fengjuan, pointed out: "Practical work can also help people progress." She gave me a lot of inspiration. From then on, I regarded practical work as equally important as theoretical study. Comrade Tao Fengjuan was my student ten years ago. Although her work style is very humble today, I still often go to her like a primary school student to solve problems. In this way, with the help of comrades, I began my collective life.

　　On May Day, I followed the school to Tiananmen Square to participate in the celebration and be reviewed. It rained heavily that day, but everyone persisted and completed the parade excitedly. After the lights were turned on, I returned home, and the whole family was waiting for me and had prepared a pot of very hot water, ready for me to take a warm bath as soon as I returned. As I washed, I missed the comrades and students who went with us. I thought, how could everyone in the school get a warm bath! I was very uneasy, but the next morning, as soon as I entered the school gate, I heard that the conference had arranged yesterday for each unit to prepare hot ginger and brown sugar water for the participants in the parade, and in the evening, comrades from the government and the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China came to express their condolences. I immediately thought: The new China is really a happy big family!

　　Jingyun returned to Beijing from London in January 1950 and worked at Peking University First Hospital. Before that, I wrote to him at any time to tell him about the changes in the motherland and our family. I always felt that it was a pity that he had not personally experienced this great, unprecedented, and historically significant change! After he returned to China, I tried my best to make up for this loss for him, passing on what I knew to him. When I studied Comrade Liu Shaoqi's speech at the May Day Cadre Conference, I found an opportunity to introduce this article to Jingyun. This speech gave him great encouragement. On the day before May Fourth, Wentai and I were both prepared to be reviewed again the next day, and Jingyun began to consider whether he would participate. But I didn't understand the situation of Peking University First Hospital and his views on the review, so I didn't help him make a decision. As a result, he stayed at home to write lectures. By October 1st, Jingyun completely and excitedly participated in the team of the Education Trade Union and went to Tiananmen Square to be reviewed. I was already very tired when I came back that day, but he still took the children to the roof of the Children's Hospital to watch the fireworks in the evening.

　　In November, the Resist America, Aid Korea movement began, and our whole family took action: Wentai was the first to sign up to join the volunteer army at school. I led the Education Trade Union of Peimant Girls' Middle School (I was elected chairman of the trade union in September) to cooperate with the administration and student union to set off a wave of current affairs learning and propaganda work. Jingyun joined the volunteer surgical team and set off for the front on November 26. I brought back the students' letters of condolence several times at night to read, which gave the children a great education. They also wrote many letters of condolence, and even Wen Yuan, who was in the second grade of primary school, spent a lot of effort writing two letters to Korean children. Three-year-old Wen Yi also loved to say, "Truman, you bastard, MacArthur, you bastard." I thought: Children who grow up in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement have a deeper understanding of "bastard."

　　On January 13th of this year, after listening to the report by Representative Wu Xiuquan, the children surrounded me and asked questions. I gave them a briefing. The children listened quietly and excitedly, more disciplined than ever. I thought: Even such young children are so concerned about national affairs, how bright the future of the new China should be! Their attitude also educated me. There are too many things I should learn, and I should hurry up and seize the time!

　　I am very envious of Jingyun. He often sends letters. From his letters, I can see that his work enthusiasm is very high and his progress is very fast. He recently wrote to me asking me to sort out some orthopedic equipment and find a way to bring it to the surgical team. He said, "Our family is a revolutionary family. Everything must be based on the interests of the country. We must do our best to contribute everything we have." In this way, my whole family is moving forward. Of course, we still have many shortcomings, but it has only been two years! Our life has completely changed. The changes in my family in the past two years have given me this experience. We cannot wait for progress. We must study humbly, work hard, and strive for progress! We cannot make progress alone. We must unite, encourage each other, and progress together!

　　我家两年来的变化
    贝满女中数学教员  步春生
    两年以前我象个冬眠的虫子，钻到土里去逃避严寒。那时，我不知道春天是否会来。我是剥削阶级出身，在燕园度过我的大学时代，在教会学校教过书，对残酷寒冷的现实，我丝毫没有战斗的勇气，从太平洋战争爆发后就回到家里，关起大门当主妇。丈夫陈景云是个非常老实的好医生，我赞成他的纯技术观点。他负担全家的生活，我就只管看孩子。那时我曾想：生为一个女子是比生为一个男子好些，可以躲在家里不碰那污浊的社会。我把家庭布置的很舒服，还顾着三个佣人。朋友们都说我是个好内助。孩子们一个个像消过毒似的，大孩子长到十一岁，没有大人接送还是不许出门，甚至和邻居都没个往来。我们不愿闻问政治，好像自己是超乎一切。虽然有时候也觉得郁闷，那就只有发发牢骚，第二天仍然毫不变样的过下去。
    解放的锣鼓像春雷似的惊醒了我。我走出了大门，呼吸着温润的带着春草香味的空气。呵！一切都活跃起来了！我住的胡同里，住下了年青的红脸庞的解放军。他们爱孩子们，孩子们也爱他们。我开始把孩子们撒出去，也开始和邻居们往来。现在，我们的家和外面逐渐打成一片，我的十一岁的大孩子文泰也被批准为青年团候补团员了。让我回忆一件动人的事实吧！一天晚上文泰躺在床上忽然把我叫去说：“妈妈，你知道吗？我们的学校现在建立了少年儿童队了，我又参加少年儿童队了。”他的眼里闪着快乐的光辉。他小小的年纪就觉得这是很愉快很光荣的了。他给了我鼓舞，也给了我力量。学生时代的热火又在我的身上燃烧起来！我在人民日报上读到爱伦堡在第一次世界和大上的报告，我的心燃烧到了白热程度，脑子里从早到晚老转着一个念头：“我也要去救火！”但那时景云正在伦敦学习，我需要照顾四个孩子。于是我决定先充实自己：看一些政治的和文艺的书籍，后来又集中读毛主席的著作。十年不读书的我，自然是有许多问题不能自己解决的。这时我遇见了郑德芳同志。战前我们是好朋友，“七七”事变后她去了解放区，虽然十二年的分离，在她已是平地建起楼阁，而我这边却是遍地野草一片荒芜，但我们一见之后，又和十二年前一样的熟悉起来。她给了我很大帮助，通过她，我更进一步的认识了共产党，接受了共产党的主张。
    一九五○年二月，我走出家庭，在贝满女中当数学教员。这个任务叫我十分惶恐，我立刻好好地，虚心地学习。王鸿文同志是一位青年教师，按年龄她差不多能作我的女儿，她叫我“妈妈”，这“妈妈”可凡事都去向“女儿”请教。学校里的党，对我帮助很大，经常教导我。当我和一些同志认为“没时间多读书，真急人”时，党支书陶凤娟同志就指出：“实际工作也一样能帮助人进步。”她给了我很大的启示，从此，我才把实际工作看得和理论学习同等重要。陶凤娟同志是我十年前的学生，今天虽然她的工作作风非常谦虚，但我仍像小学生一样常去找她解决问题。就这样，在同志们的帮助下，我开始了我的集体生活。
    “五一”劳动节，我随着学校去天安门参加庆祝会并受检阅，那天下了一阵大雨，但是大家都坚持着，而且兴奋地完成了游行。上灯后我回到家里，全家都在等待着我，并安排了很热的一锅水，预备我回来立刻洗一个暖浴，我一面洗，一面怀念着我们一同去的同志们和同学们，我想住校的人们那能每个人都得着暖浴啊！我很不安心，但是第二天早晨我一进校门就听说昨天由大会布置下来，每个单位都准备滚热的姜糖水给参加游行的人喝，到夜晚又有政府和中共北京市委员会的同志们来慰问。我立刻想：新中国真是一个美满的大家庭！
    景云是一九五○年一月从伦敦回到北京的，在北大医院工作。在这以前，我随时将祖国的和我们家庭的变化写信告诉他。我一直觉得他未能亲身经历这伟大的、空前的、有历史意义的变化是一憾事！他回国后，我尽力为他弥补这损失，将所知道的传达给他。当我学了刘少奇同志在“五一”干部大会上的讲话，就找了个机会将这篇东西介绍给景云看，这讲话给了他很大的鼓励。到了“五四”的前一天，我和文泰都准备第二天再受检阅，景云就开始考虑他参不参加的问题。但我不了解北大医院的情况和他对检阅的看法，因此没有帮助他做决定。结果他还是留在家里写讲义。到了十月一日，景云就完全肯定地、兴奋地参加了教育工会的队伍，到天安门广场去接受检阅，这天回来我已很疲乏，而他到晚上还带着孩子到儿童医院的屋顶上去看焰火。
    十一月抗美援朝运动开始，我们全家都行动起来：文泰首先在学校签名参加志愿军，我领导贝满女中教育工会（我自九月当选为工会主席）配合行政和学生会，掀起时事学习和宣传工作的热潮，景云则参加了志愿手术队，并且在十一月二十六日出发前方去了。我几次晚上带回学生写的慰问信来读，这给了孩子们很大的教育，他们也都写了好些慰问信，连在初小二年级的文元、也费了很大力气写了两封信给朝鲜小朋友。三岁的文宜也爱说：“杜鲁门你混蛋，麦克阿瑟你混蛋。”我想：在抗美援朝运动中成长的孩子，对于“混蛋”的认识也是更深一步的。
    今年一月十三日，我听了伍修权代表的报告后，孩子们都围着我问这问那，我就向他们作了一次传达，孩子们安静地兴奋地听着，比任何时候都有纪律。我想：这样小的孩子都这样关心国事，新中国的远景该是多么灿烂啊！他们的态度也教育了我，我该学习的东西太多了，应该赶快抓紧时间啊！
    我很羡慕景云，他常有信来，从他信里可以看出，他的工作热情非常高，进步也非常快。他最近来信要我整理一些骨科用具设法带去送给手术队，他说：“我们的家庭是革命的家庭，一切要以国家的利益为前提，我们要尽力贡献我们的一切。”就这样，我的全家都在前进着。当然，我们还有不少的缺点，但是才只有两年的工夫啊！我们的生活就整个变了样，两年来我的家庭的变化，给了我这样的经验，我们不能等待进步，必须虚心学习，努力工作，争取进步！我们不能一个人闹进步，还必须大家团结、互相鼓励，一起进步！
