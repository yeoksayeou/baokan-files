Xinhua News Agency, Northern Korea, January 14th: The General Headquarters of the Korean People's Army issued a comprehensive communiqué on January 12 regarding the New Year offensive in central Korea by the People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, stating: The invading forces headed by U.S. imperialism and the Syngman Rhee puppet army launched two offensives called "Thanksgiving Homecoming" and "Christmas Homecoming," suffering a powerful counterattack from our Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteer Forces. On the banks of the Chongchon River and by Changjin Lake, they suffered a loss of 50,000 troops, discarding their helmets and armor, fleeing in disarray, and abandoning Pyongyang and Hamhung in a state of panic. Suddenly, they found a magic weapon, the "38th Parallel," which was actually a tattered hat long since destroyed by U.S. imperialism, but they picked it up again and revered it as "impregnable." On the one hand, they illegally passed a "Three-Man Ceasefire Committee" in their puppet "United Nations General Assembly," attempting to ease and stop the advance of our People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteer Forces to gain a chance to catch their breath. On the other hand, they heavily "decorated" this tattered hat, the "38th Parallel," deploying three lines of defense on a front of over 400 li from the mouth of the Imjin River in the west to the coast in the east, and a depth of 140 li from north to south, combining eight puppet army divisions and four U.S. and British divisions for frontal defense. In addition to utilizing existing permanent fortifications (reinforced concrete bunkers), they also universally constructed bunkers, communication trenches, set up barbed wire, and laid landmines, attempting to hold firm and await reinforcements for further aggression. Our Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteer Forces had long seen through their plot, and launched a powerful New Year offensive on New Year's Eve. After several hours of fierce fighting, they broke through gaps in many places on the enemy's 400-li front. Then, like raging waves, countless sharp knives stabbed into the depths, developing rapidly at a speed of about one kilometer per hour (an average of 15 kilometers per day), encircling and annihilating the enemy in major battles such as Jungbong, Jaenung-ri, Dongducheon, Goyang, and Uijeongbu, inflicting heavy damage. After breaking through the enemy's second line of defense at Munsan, Uijeongbu, Pocheon, Gapyeong, and Chuncheon, the enemy's entire line wavered. Our army took advantage of the victory to pursue and attack, capturing Seoul in one fell swoop. Then, crossing the Han River, we recovered important towns, airports, and ports such as Yeongdeungpo, Gimpo, Incheon, Ganghwa, Suwon, Yangpyeong, Icheon, Yeoju, Hongcheon, Hoengseong, and Wonju, victoriously concluding the New Year offensive. A comprehensive report of the gains is as follows:

　　Account: annihilated the 31st and 32nd regiments of the puppet 2nd Division, the 36th regiment of the puppet 5th Division, and an entire tank battalion of the 7th Tank Regiment of the British 29th Brigade, the 35th regiment of the puppet 5th Division, and most of the 21st regiment of the puppet 8th Division, and one battalion of the 17th Regiment of the puppet 2nd Division. Defeated the puppet 6th Division, puppet 1st Division, puppet 3rd Division, puppet 9th Division, U.S. 24th Division, U.S. 25th Division, and British 29th Brigade, and annihilated parts of each. Killed and wounded 4,861 officers and soldiers, including the commander of the 32nd Regiment of the puppet army, and 1,118 officers and soldiers of the U.S. and British invading forces. Captured the deputy commander and deputy chief of staff of the 36th Regiment of the puppet army, a U.S. Major advisor of the 31st Regiment of the puppet army, and 116 officers below the rank of U.S. Major advisor of the 36th Regiment of the puppet army, and 6,442 soldiers. Captured 12 officers, including the battalion commander (Major) of the tank battalion of the British 29th Brigade, and 460 soldiers.

　　The above totals 13,009 U.S. and puppet troops killed, wounded, and captured (including 1,590 U.S. and British troops). Seized 99 howitzers, 15 recoilless guns, 21 anti-tank guns, 22 mountain guns, 113 mortars, 114 rocket launchers, 17 anti-aircraft machine guns, 493 light and heavy machine guns, 22 submachine guns, 4,600 automatic rifles, 1,582 carbines, 4,192 rounds of various artillery shells, and 598,590 rounds of various bullets. Captured 27 tanks, 253 vehicles, 4 armored vehicles, 5 radio stations, 24 wireless telephones, 4 telephone switchboards, and 28 single units. In addition, destroyed more than 10 tanks, 10 armored vehicles, and more than 70 vehicles. (Attached photo)
　　
　　Another clear contrast on the Korean battlefield: Top picture: The American prisoners who have been treated with leniency have generally realized the shame of working for Wall Street. They collectively wrote letters to their families saying: "The U.S. military should withdraw from Korea and end this inhuman war of aggression." Bottom picture: American soldiers who blindly fought against the Chinese and Korean People's Forces died in vain for Wall Street capitalists and can only wait to be buried by the Chinese and Korean people.

　　中朝人民部队新年攻势战绩辉煌
    一举破敌三道防线歼敌万三千
    缴获重炮四百门坦克二十七辆
    【新华社朝鲜北部十四日电】朝鲜人民军总司令部于本月十二日发表人民军与中国人民志愿军在朝鲜中部的新年攻势综合公报称：美帝国主义为首的侵略军和李承晚卖国军举行了所谓“感恩节还乡”“圣诞节还乡”两次攻势，遭受我朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿部队的强大反击，在清川江岸长津湖畔损兵折将五万之众，丢盔卸甲，狼奔豕突，放弃平壤、咸兴，仓皇失措之际，忽然拾得一件法宝“三十八度线”，其实它是早被美帝国主义破坏无余的一顶烂帽子，却又重新拣起奉为“金汤”，一面在其御用的“联合国大会”非法通过了“三人停火委员会”，企图缓和与阻止我人民军与中国人民志愿部队的进军，骗得喘息机会；一面却在这顶烂帽子“三十八度线”上大事“装璜”，于西起临津江口东至海岸四百余里正面，南北一百四十里纵深布置三道防线，纠合八个伪军师四个美、英师作面的设防。除利用旧有永久筑城（洋灰铁筋碉堡）外，并普遍构筑地堡交通壕、设铁丝网、埋地雷，企图固守以待增援，再行进犯。我朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿部队早已洞烛其奸，遂于除夕展开强大的新年攻势。经过数小时的激战，在敌四百里正面防线上多处突破缺口。接着像狂涛怒浪一般无数把尖刀一齐杀向纵深，以每小时约一公里的速度（平均每天十五公里）猛烈发展，于中峰、济宁里、东豆川、高阳、议政府等主要战斗中，分别包围歼灭敌人，予以重创。突破汶山、议政府、抱川、加平、春川敌第二道防线后，敌人全线动摇。我军遂乘胜追击，一鼓攻下汉城。接着跨越汉江，收复永登浦、金浦、仁川、江华、水原、杨平、利川、骊州、洪川、横城、原州等重要城镇与机场港口，胜利地结束了新年攻势。所得战绩综合通报如下：
    计：歼灭伪第二师三十一联队、三十二联队，伪第五师三十六联队及英二十九旅坦克第七团一个坦克营全部，伪第五师三十五联队，伪第八师二十一联队大部，伪第二师十七联队一个营。击溃伪六师、伪一师、伪三师、伪九师，美二十四师、美二十五师、英二十九旅，并各歼其一部。打死打伤伪军第三十二联队队长以下官兵四千八百六十一名，美英侵略军官兵一千一百一十八名。俘虏伪三十六联队副联队长、副参谋长，伪三十一联队美籍少校顾问及伪三十六联队美籍少校顾问以下军官一百一十六名，士兵六千四百四十二名。俘英二十九旅坦克营少校营长以下军官十二名，士兵四百六十名。
    以上总计共毙、伤、俘美、伪军一万三千零九名（内美、英军一千五百九十名）。缴获榴弹炮九十九门，无座力炮十五门，战防炮二十一门，山炮二十二门，迫击炮一百一十三门、火箭炮一百一十四门，高射机关炮十七门、轻重机关枪四百九十三挺，冲锋枪二十二挺，自动步枪四千六百枝，卡宾枪一千五百八十二枝，各种炮弹四一九二发，各种子弹五九八五九○发。缴获坦克二十七辆，汽车二五三辆，装甲车四辆，电台五部，无线电话机二十四部，电话总机四部，单机二十八部。另击毁坦克十余辆，装甲车十辆，汽车七十余辆。（附图片）
    朝鲜战场上又一明显的对照：上图：得到宽待的美俘普遍觉悟到为华尔街卖命的可耻，他们集体写信给家人说：“美军应该退出朝鲜，结束这惨无人道的侵略战争。”下图：盲目地与中朝人民部队作战的美国士兵，为华尔街资本家而死于非命，只好等待中朝人民加以掩埋了。
