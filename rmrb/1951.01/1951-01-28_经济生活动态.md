　　Nanjing Industrial Production Exceeded Targets Last Year

　　In 1950, Nanjing's state-owned factories overcame various temporary difficulties such as enemy blockades and bombings, and successfully completed and exceeded the original production targets. For example, the Radio Factory completed its annual plan in ten months, and its production efficiency was more than four times higher than the factory's highest output in the ten years since its establishment. The Wireless Factory also completed 104.6% of its annual plan. Most of the other factories also exceeded their production targets.

　　Taiyuan Xinxian Station Has Not Had an Accident for Six Months

　　With the efforts of all staff, the Xinxian Station of the Taiyuan Railway Bureau implemented the joint labor responsibility system, strengthened the planning of operations, and established order and systems for each link in the work process, thereby avoiding possible accidents. By the end of last year, the station had successfully completed a new record of six months without accidents.

　　Six Thousand Cooperative Members in Chahar Province Will Receive Rations

　　The Chahar Provincial Cooperative has tentatively set the number of members who will receive low-priced rations this time at 60,000, mainly factory workers and farmers in rural areas. In addition, the agreement between the Provincial Cooperative and the Grain Company to exchange grain for industrial products has been reached. Local supply and marketing cooperatives have signed 22 contracts with native produce companies to promote the sale of local products, and the cooperative societies of Charnan and Chabei special districts and counties have also signed barter contracts with each other.

　　Sideline Income of Farmers in Lushun-Dalian Reaches 30 Billion Northeast Yuan

　　Since the beginning of winter, farmers in Lushun-Dalian have developed a variety of sideline productions from point to area, turning the winter slack into winter busy. Most areas have also paid attention to strengthening the planning and organization of sideline production, avoiding blindness. So far, according to statistics, the income from sideline production has reached 30 billion yuan (Northeast currency).

　　Central South Region Donates 720,000 Sets of Winter Clothing to Henan Disaster Victims

　　About 720,000 sets of winter clothing donated by Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Wuhan to the disaster victims in Henan (as of the end of last year) have been appropriately distributed to the severely affected areas through the Henan Provincial Production and Disaster Relief Committee, basically solving the problem of clothing shortages for the disaster victims. The Henan Provincial Production and Disaster Relief Committee, on behalf of the disaster victims in the province, sent a letter to compatriots from all walks of life who are enthusiastic about disaster relief, expressing their gratitude and their firm confidence in overcoming the disaster.
