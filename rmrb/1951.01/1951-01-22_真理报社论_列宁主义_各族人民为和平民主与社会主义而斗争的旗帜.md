Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 20th (TASS): Today, the *Pravda* published an editorial entitled "Leninism – The Banner of All Peoples Struggling for Peace, Democracy, and Socialism." The article states: Tomorrow marks the 27th anniversary of the death of the great Lenin, the founder of the Soviet state and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks), and the leader and teacher of the working people of the world.

This year is 1951, precisely the beginning year of the second half of the 20th century. On this year's anniversary of Lenin's death, the greatness of Lenin and his immortal doctrine is manifesting immense power before humanity. Under the banner of Lenin and Stalin, hundreds of millions of working people are building their new lives. Under the banner of Lenin and Stalin, the working masses in capitalist countries are fighting against capitalism and striving for the victory of socialism.

The grand mobilizational and transformative power of the great Leninist thought has been embodied in the historical events of the first half of the 20th century. The great October Socialist Revolution, the Soviet Union's victory over Fascist forces in World War II, the establishment of people's democratic regimes in many countries, the historical victory of the Chinese people's revolution, and the rise of the unprecedented organized peace movement—all these were achieved under the banner of Leninism and are major and pivotal events of the first half of this century.

The name of Lenin, the brilliant thinker and great revolutionary, has become a symbol of a new era in human development, an era marking the turning point from the old capitalist world to the new socialist world.

The editorial continued: Lenin said that no force could save capitalism from extinction. In our era, the profound wisdom and correctness of Lenin's words are more evident than ever before. The editorial pointed out that the irreconcilable contradictions tearing apart the dying capitalist world are deepening and intensifying. The tycoons of the capitalist world, unable to find a way out of unsolvable contradictions, are increasingly openly embarking on the path of fascism, aggression, and launching new wars. The main stronghold and center of bellicose reactionaries, the foremost warmongers instigating new wars, is US imperialism—according to Lenin, the most reactionary and frenzied imperialism, strangling all weak countries, restoring reactionary forces, and attempting to dominate the world.

US and British imperialism are trying everything possible to "save" the inevitably doomed capitalist world, attempting to strangle the increasingly powerful forces of socialism and democracy. They are waging bloody wars against the people of the East, they are conducting a predatory war of aggression against the Korean people, and they are committing overt acts of aggression against the People's Republic of China. They are engaged in a frantic arms expansion movement, restoring German imperialism, re-establishing the German Fascist revanchist army, and preparing for military adventures in Europe. The hideous, beastly face of US imperialism has been exposed in Korea, where American interventionist troops use their weapons to massacre civilians, women, and children. In Korea, they have razed many towns and villages to the ground, barbarically destroying the most precious cultural relics.

The editorial emphasized that the entire course of historical development has clearly told the people that only socialism can save humanity from war, from hunger, and from the extinction of hundreds of millions.

The Soviet Union has become the center of admiration for all advanced and progressive humanity. Now that US and British imperialists are particularly frenziedly trying to ignite the flames of a new war, the people of all countries see very clearly that only the Soviet socialist state is pursuing a genuine policy of peace, and other countries in the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism—liberated China and the people's democratic countries—are also pursuing this policy. Stalin, the brilliant successor to Lenin's immortal cause, is the inspirer and standard-bearer of the world's people's struggle for peace.

The editorial continued that the most prominent feature of the post-war period is the growth of the influence of the Communists in all countries. Stalin said that this phenomenon cannot be considered accidental; it is a very natural phenomenon. During the difficult years of Fascist rule in Europe, the Communists proved themselves to be loyal, reliable, heroic, and selfless fighters against Fascist rule and for the freedom of all peoples. The strength of the influence of the Communists today lies in the fact that they stand at the forefront of the fighters for peace and the security of all peoples, for democracy and socialism. The Communist parties of France, Italy, and other capitalist countries have achieved success because they are faithful to the doctrine of Lenin and Stalin.

The great ideas of Lenin and Stalin are increasingly deeply and widely disseminated among the broad masses of the people, while the forces of the right-wing Social Democrats, the servants of imperialism, the most ferocious enemies of peace and democracy, and the enemies of the working class have been declining and weakening.

The *Pravda* editorial concluded that humanity is now living in a great era. The immortal ideas of Leninism are being put into practice on an ever-greater scale. The ideas of Leninism are exerting a tremendous and ever-increasing influence on the fate of all peoples and all countries, and on the development of human society.

The victorious banner of Lenin and Stalin unites hundreds of millions of people, uniting them in the great struggle for peace, democracy, and socialism. No force can hinder the victorious advance of communism toward complete victory.

Under the banner of Lenin, under the leadership of Stalin, forward to new victories!

    真理报社论
    “列宁主义——各族人民为和平民主与社会主义而斗争的旗帜”
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十日电：真理报今日发表社论，题为“列宁主义——各族人民为和平民主与社会主义而斗争的旗帜”。文称：明天是伟大的列宁、苏维埃国家和苏联共产党（布）的缔造者、全世界劳动人民的领袖和导师逝世的二十七周年。
    今年是一九五一年，正是二十世纪后半开始的一年，在今年的列宁忌辰，列宁和他的不朽的学说的伟大性，在人类面前表现着巨大的力量。在列宁和斯大林的旗帜下，亿万劳动人民正在建造他们的新生活。在列宁和斯大林的旗帜下，资本主义国家的劳动群众正在进行斗争，反对资本主义，争取社会主义的胜利。
    伟大的列宁主义思想所具有的宏大的动员和改造的力量，已经体现在二十世纪前半的历史事件中。伟大的十月社会主义革命，苏联在第二次世界大战中战胜了法西斯势力，许多国家建立了人民民主政权，中国人民革命的历史性的胜利，空前未有的有组织的和平运动的兴起，这些都是在列宁主义旗帜下实现的、是本世纪前半的重大的关键性的事件。
    天才的思想家和伟大的革命家列宁的名字已成了人类发展的新纪元的象征，这是标志着由资本主义旧世界进到社会主义新世界的转折点的纪元。
    社论继称：列宁说过，没有任何力量能够挽救资本主义免于灭亡。在我们这个时代，列宁的这句话的深邃的智慧和正确性比以往任何时候都更加明显了。社论指出：将垂死的资本主义世界撕裂得七零八落的无可调和的矛盾正在加深和加剧。资本主义世界的大亨们，由于找不到逃脱无法解决的矛盾的出路，正越来越公开地走上法西斯主义、侵略和发动新战争的道路。好战的反动派的主要堡垒和中心，挑拨新战争的首要战争贩子，就是美帝国主义——根据列宁所说，这是最反动、最疯狂的帝国主义，它扼杀着所有的弱小国家，恢复反动势力，力图独霸世界。
    美英帝国主义试图尽一切可能以“挽救”必然灭亡的资本主义世界，企图绞杀日益强大的社会主义和民主力量。他们正在对东方的人民进行血腥的战争，他们正在对朝鲜人民进行掠夺的侵略战争，他们正在对中华人民共和国作公开的侵略行为。他们从事疯狂的扩充军备运动，恢复德国帝国主义，重新建立德国法西斯复仇的军队，并准备在欧洲作军事冒险。美帝国主义的狰狞的兽性的面目在朝鲜已经暴露无遗了；在朝鲜，美国干涉军以他们的武器去屠杀平民，屠杀妇女和儿童，在朝鲜他们夷平了许多城镇和乡村，野蛮地破坏了最珍贵的文物。
    社论着重指出：历史发展的整个行程已经明白地告诉人民，惟有社会主义能挽救人类免于战争，免于饥饿和挽救千百万人免于灭亡。
    苏联已经成为全体先进的进步人类景仰的中心。现在，美英帝国主义者既然格外猖狂地力图燃起新战争的大火，各国的人民就极明白地看到，唯有苏维埃社会主义国家在奉行真正的和平政策，和平、民主与社会主义阵营的其他国家——解放了的中国和人民民主国家也在奉行这一政策。列宁的不朽事业的天才继承者斯大林是世界人民争取和平斗争的鼓舞者和旗手。
    社论继称，战后时期的最特出的特征就是一切国家共产党人的影响的增长。斯大林说，这一现象，不能认为是偶然的，这是很自然的现象。在法西斯统治欧洲的艰难的岁月里，共产党人证明了他们是反对法西斯统治，争取各族人民自由的忠实可靠、英勇无我的战士。目前共产党人的影响的力量，原因在于他们是站在争取和平与各族人民安全，争取民主与社会主义的战士的最前列。法国、意大利和其他资本主义国家的共产党之所以得到成功，是因为他们忠实于列宁——斯大林的学说。
    伟大的列宁斯大林的思想，正愈益深入而广泛地传布到广大人民群众中间，而帝国主义的奴仆右翼社会党、和平民主的这些最凶恶的敌人、工人阶级的敌人的势力却一直在衰落下降。
    真理报社论结语称，人类现在正生活在伟大的时代。不朽的列宁主义的思想正在以越来越大的规模付诸实践。列宁主义的思想对于各族人民和各个国家的命运，对于人类社会的发展发挥着巨大的日益增大的影响。
    列宁和斯大林的胜利的旗帜团结着亿万人民，把他们团结起来进行争取和平、民主和社会主义的伟大斗争。没有任何力量可以阻挠共产主义胜利地向前迈进，一直到完全的胜利。
    在列宁的旗帜下，在斯大林的领导下向新的胜利前进！
