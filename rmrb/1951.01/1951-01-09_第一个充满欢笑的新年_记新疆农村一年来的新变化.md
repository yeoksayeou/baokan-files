　　The First New Year Filled with Laughter
    Recording the New Changes in Xinjiang's Rural Areas Over the Past Year
    Hu Zhong
            I. New Labor Attitudes and New Farming Methods
    This year, the Xinjiang People's Liberation Army carried out a vigorous large-scale production campaign. Fertilizer piled up into small mountains, new soil was turned over on barren land, new canals flowed with water, washing away the alkali in the fields, seeds were sown, followed by weeding, thinning, and fertilizing, the troops were constantly working hard.
    The people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang watched the army's farming with curious eyes. They were very interested in the army's relatively advanced farming methods. On the army's farmland, groups of three to five villagers could often be seen visiting the tall and large crops.
    The people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang felt that the world had changed in their daily lives. What they felt changed the most was that the Party and the People's Government called for production, sent working groups to the countryside, organized farmers' associations, and launched them to adjust the rental relationship of public land. The public land that was originally sublet to farmers by landlords at high rents could now be directly rented by farmers. Moreover, the public land occupied by landlords was abolished, allowing some farmers to have land to cultivate. At the same time, based on the principle of borrowing and repayment, mutual lending among farmers was initiated to help poor farmers solve the difficulty of seeds. The People's Government also issued agricultural loans in the Dihua area, enabling farmers to plant winter wheat.
    According to incomplete statistics, in Southern Xinjiang (Kashgar, Aksu, Shache, Hotan, and other areas), the rental relationship of more than 533,000 mu of public land was adjusted, and 212,000 *chengzis* (one *chengzi* equals sixteen *jin*) of seeds were mutually lent. Among them, in the Shache area, the rental relationship of more than 240,000 mu of public land was adjusted, and more than 72,000 farming households got land to cultivate, and more than 44,000 *chengzis* of grain seeds were mutually lent, benefiting more than 33,000 farming households.
    Farmers' enthusiasm for production has been enhanced, and new labor attitudes have gradually been established among the people of Xinjiang.
    In the past, labor was despised, and laborers were called "those who endure hardship." When the people of Xinjiang first saw the People's Liberation Army, from leaders to soldiers, participating in labor such as collecting manure, pulling stones, reclaiming wasteland, and digging canals, they were moved. This gradually made them realize that the political status of laborers had been improved, and the concept of regarding labor as honorable has been initially established among the people of Xinjiang.
    In the past, idlers who spent their time visiting neighbors and wandering around, now have land to cultivate and, under the pressure of social atmosphere and the supervision of farmers' associations, have begun to engage in labor production. In Shache area alone, 6,193 idlers and hooligans were educated and organized to participate in labor. Women also began to participate in production. In six regions, including Kashgar, Dihua, Aksu, Yili, Yanqi, and the city of Dihua, more than 490,000 women participated in production movements such as repairing canals, reclaiming wasteland, and harvesting autumn crops. Some of them even vowed to become female *Baturs* (heroes) in production. Reclaiming more wasteland, digging more canals, and producing more grain have become universal movements in rural areas.
    Under the influence of the People's Liberation Army's production, Xinjiang farmers' farming methods have also begun to improve. In the past, they did not weed, thin, or fertilize their fields. They sowed the seeds and waited for harvest. Some areas even believed that weeds could protect the seedlings, such as the people of Yiwu County, who believed that "wheat fields must have grass; without grass, the wheat will not grow." Now they have also begun to pull weeds. Some have pulled them two or three times, and a few have pulled them more than five or six times. Women are very enthusiastic about weeding. Collecting manure, fertilizing, and thinning have also gradually become popular. From this year's harvest, farmers have understood that "to produce more grain, intensive farming is necessary."
    This year, after poor farmers had land to cultivate and borrowed seeds, they suffered from a lack of livestock. The Party, the government, and farmers' associations called for the organization of labor exchange and mutual aid groups on the principle of voluntariness and mutual benefit, using manpower to exchange for cattle power. Labor exchange and mutual aid groups helped farmers who lacked the means of production. Farmers saw the advantages of labor exchange groups and were willing to accept this form of production organization.
    In the Aksu area alone, there are more than 150 labor exchange and mutual aid groups. For example, the labor exchange group named after the group leader Kezi Kuwaer in Aili Bolek Village includes nine poor farmers and three middle farmers. The entire group has 13 male laborers and 15 female laborers. All households own a total of 280 mu of land, 25 cattle, one horse, five donkeys, and five large carts. This year's spring plowing proved that organizing together was more beneficial than working individually. They still exchanged labor when planting winter wheat. They said, "Lack of planning leads to lifelong poverty. Middle peasants help poor peasants, and poor peasants help middle peasants. We will still engage in labor exchange." When calculating, the amount of labor per person is determined based on each household's land, labor, livestock, and farm tools, so no one suffers a loss.
    The new society brings new customs, and new customs bring forth new figures. Xinjiang farmers are working happily with new labor attitudes and new farming methods.
            II. Chairman Mao and the Communist Party Have Brought Good Times to the People of Xinjiang
    Xinjiang farmers are spending the first year full of laughter and harvest.
    "Where there is water, there is land." In Xinjiang, water is as vital to farmers as land. However, during the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, water was occupied by landlords and *bays* (wealthy people). For example, the landlord Jiang Weiming in the North Wu Cha Village of Suilai opened a separate canal on the main canal, allowing water to flow day and night, while the 90 households living downstream could only water their fields once every five days, and they didn't even have water to drink. The water price was arbitrarily set by the landlord. For example, there is no river water in Turpan, and *karez* water needs to be dug to irrigate the land. The *karez* are all occupied by landlords. During the summer and autumn seasons, landlords sell the leftover water to farmers at high prices. In some areas, the water price for irrigating one *shi* of land (approximately 25 *mu*) in summer is four *shi* of wheat, and irrigating one *shi* of land in autumn requires seven *shi* of sorghum. Many farmers could only watch their crops wither and die due to drought because they could not afford the water price. In the past, water disputes often resulted in deaths. After liberation, the unreasonable occupation of water conservancy was abolished, and water conservancy committees were organized everywhere to rationally use water volume and adjust water prices, greatly reducing water disputes. Under the influence and assistance of the People's Liberation Army in vigorously building water conservancy, through the call and organization of the Party, the government, and farmers' associations, people in various places launched a surge in repairing old canals, digging new canals, and digging *karez*.
    This year, Kuqa repaired and newly opened 863 canals, with 191,000 people participating. Aksu newly dug 1,156 canals and repaired 360 canals, which can irrigate 14,873 mu of dry land. Hotan newly dug 256 main canals and 2,535 branch canals.
    With water, the area of cultivated land has increased. Farmers in southern Xinjiang have newly reclaimed a total of 287,368 mu of wasteland. Among them, in the ninth district of Hotan County alone, the reclaimed wasteland reached more than 10,000 mu. In the Dihua area, the cultivated land has also increased in individual areas. For example, in Daban City of Dihua County, the wheat land has increased by 380 mu compared to last year, and the sorghum and corn have increased by 490 mu.
    Due to the adoption of new farming methods, this year's yields have increased. According to a survey in Deyitun Village, Shule County, wheat fields that were fertilized, thinned, and weeded can yield 12 to 13 *chengzis* per mu this year. The best corn and sorghum can yield 17 to 18 *chengzis* per mu, while in previous years, wheat fields only yielded 5 to 8 *chengzis* per mu, and the best corn and sorghum could only yield 13 *chengzis* per mu. Moreover, after fertilizing, the land is fertile. This year, winter wheat was harvested in June, followed by planting millet, and after the autumn harvest, the land is left fallow, and wheat is planted again next spring, allowing for three harvests in two years. In the past, the land had to be left fallow for a while after harvesting winter wheat to allow the soil to recover before planting wheat again.
    This year, except for the Dihua area, where sowing was not timely due to the harassment of bandits such as Usman, and the Yili and Tacheng areas, where yields were reduced due to sudden climate changes, agricultural production in other areas has increased by about 20%, and some counties have even increased by 25% to 30%. In the 30 counties of southern Xinjiang, there are 9 million mu of cultivated land, of which 3 million mu are wheat fields. Each mu has an average increase of at least 30 *jin*, meaning that the summer wheat can increase production by 90 million *jin*. There are 6 million mu of autumn fields, with an average increase of 16 *jin* per mu, which can increase production by 96 million *jin*. This year, southern Xinjiang increased grain production by 186 million *jin*.
    The increase in production is even more evident in Wuqia County, located at the southwesternmost tip of Xinjiang, near the Kyrgyz Republic of the Soviet Union.
    Wuqia County is a gathering place for the Kyrgyz ethnic group in Xinjiang. In previous years, most of their grain had to be transported from Kashgar. This year, after planting the land, the local shortage of grain is not significant, and less grain was transported than in previous years by 60% to 80%. Moreover, because life has improved, the Kyrgyz people who had been living elsewhere to make a living have also returned to Wuqia County. At the time of liberation, there were only 8,000 to 9,000 people locally, but now it has increased to more than 11,000 people. They said that the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army saved them, and the current life is something they have never seen before.
    A good harvest year, coupled with a reasonable grain requisition policy and an increase in the prices of agricultural products (in the past, the Kuomintang reactionaries exploited farmers through unequal exchanges by lowering the prices of agricultural products and raising the prices of industrial products, such as in Dihua last year, about five *shi* of wheat were needed to exchange for one bolt of khaki cloth, but now one bolt of khaki cloth requires less than one *shi* of wheat), the lives of farmers have improved.
    Yu Tongchun, a member of the Farmers' Association in Qitai Seventh Township, this year, all seven members of his family wore new clothes made of blue khaki cloth. In the past, they never dreamed of wearing khaki clothes.
    In Aili Bolek Village, Aksu, three poor farming families bought livestock and built houses this year, and four single men got married. Musa, who had been a hired laborer for 15 years, planted 10 mu of land this year. In the past, he didn't have enough clothes to cover his body, but this year he wore good coarse cloth clothes, and he also used two *tahes* (each *tahe* is 160 *jin*) of wheat to buy a cow and a large cart.
    Yinunusi, the poorest household in Deyitun Village, Shule County, only ate white flour (5 *jin*) and 5 *jin* of meat twice throughout the year last year. This year, after planting the land, they can eat a meal of white flour every day and eat 1.5 *jin* of meat every month. This winter, the three of them bought a pair of boots, and his wife and children put on new clothes.
    Similar examples can be cited a lot. The gradual improvement of farmers' lives and the gradual increase in purchasing power have made them praise the Communist Party, the People's Government, and the People's Liberation Army. Farmers say:
    "Chairman Mao and the Communist Party have brought us good times."
            III. New Development of Nomadic Peoples
    Xinjiang's vast plains and fertile pastures provide excellent conditions for developing animal husbandry. However, the Kazakh and Mongolian peoples, who mainly engage in animal husbandry, have been living a miserable and painful life.
    Before liberation, the lives of the Kazakh and Mongolian people were difficult. The Kuomintang reactionaries blockaded trade with the Soviet Union, and the herders' native products could not be sold. Because they had to move in all seasons, they had to enter the "winter settlement" in the deep mountains in winter. When they encountered snow disasters and wind disasters that buried the grass, large numbers of livestock died. People's culture, education, and health were out of the question. The mortality rate within the tribes was very high. The Kazakh people have been oppressed and exploited by the bandit leader Usman for many years. When the bandit leader Usman was driven out of Ashan by the revolutionary forces of the Ili, Tacheng, and Altai regions in 1947, the three Kazakh Harahas, Militi, and Moli River tribes, which were originally in Ashan, were coerced to move from Ashan to Mulei River, Fukang, and other places at the same time. In the past three years, because they were forced to supply Usman's bandits with able-bodied men, horses, cattle, and sheep, the livestock of the three tribes has decreased by two-thirds, and the number of deaths is higher than the number of births. Among the Mongolian people living in the Yanqi and Jing areas, venereal diseases were prevalent, and the mortality rate was very high. In Gongha County, Ili area, there were more than 4,000 Mongols in 1944, but now there are only more than 3,000.
    The Kazakh and Mongolian peoples were previously declining and going downhill; after liberation, they have new and upward prospects for development.
    Trade with the Soviet Union has been restored, and the herders' native products have a market. This year, trade companies have increased the purchase prices of native products in order to take care of the herders' lives. For example, sheep intestines have increased from 4 yuan per piece last year to 33 yuan, sheepskins have increased from 10.8 yuan per piece to 50 yuan, and wool has increased from 600 yuan per 100 kilograms to more than 1,700 yuan (all Xinjiang currency, each yuan is equivalent to 450 yuan of Renminbi). Last year, 100 sheep intestines from herders in Ashan could only be exchanged for (original manuscript unclear here) 19.2 meters of twill cloth, but now they can be exchanged for 76.9 meters of Qingwa khaki cloth. The income of herders has increased, and coupled with the reduction of pasture tax this year (adopting a self-declaration investigation and progressive tax calculation method, with sheep starting at 10 as the tax threshold, and agricultural draft animals not taxed if there are less than three), the lives of herders have improved. Herders who could not afford tea in the past can now afford tea, and herders who could not afford clothes in the past have now added new clothes.
    Nomadic tribes are gradually settling down and developing towards a semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral direction, and the lives of herders are gradually improving. They believe that the Communist Party and the People's Government have rescued them from their impoverished and declining situation. With the heroic and generous national traditions, they are firmly confident that their nation has a brilliant future of forward development and progress. In October, a delegation of Soviet literary and art workers came to Xinjiang to visit and perform. They saw that in the multi-ethnic family of the Soviet Union, the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic and others have made great achievements in the economic, political, cultural, and educational fields. They are even more firmly convinced that in the multi-ethnic family of the People's Republic of China, their nation also has broad prospects for development.

　　第一个充满欢笑的新年
    记新疆农村一年来的新变化
    胡中
            一、新的劳动态度和新的耕作法
    新疆人民解放军今年进行了轰轰烈烈的大生产运动。肥料堆成小山，荒地翻起了新土，新水渠里流着水，泡掉了地里的碱，撒下种籽，接着是锄草、间苗、上肥，部队一直紧张的劳动着。
    新疆各族人民以新奇的眼光关怀着军队种庄稼，他们对军队比较进步的耕作方法很有兴趣。在部队的庄稼地上，经常可以见到三五成群的老乡参观长得又高又大的庄稼。
    新疆各族人民从日常生活中感觉着世道变了。使他们觉得变化最大的是党和人民政府号召生产，派了工作组下乡，组织了农会，并发动他们调整了公地的租佃关系，原来由二地主用很高租额转租给农民的公地，现在农民可以直接租种了，而且取消了地主所霸占的公地，使一部分农民有了地种。同时在有借有还的原则下，发动了农民间的互借，帮助贫苦农民解决种籽的困难。人民政府并在迪化专区发放了农贷，使农民得种上冬麦。
    据不完全的统计，南疆（喀什、阿克苏、莎车、和阗等专区）共调整了五十三万三千余亩公地的租佃关系，互借了种籽二十一万二千余秤子（一秤子合十六市斤），其中莎车区调整了二十四万余亩公地的租佃关系，有七万二千余户农民得到地种，互借粮食种籽四万四千余秤子，有三万三千余户农民借到粮食种籽。
    农民的生产情绪提高了，新的劳动态度在新疆人民中日渐建立了起来。
    过去劳动是受贱视的，称劳动者是“下苦的”。当新疆人民初次见到解放军从首长到士兵都参加拾粪、拉石头、开荒、挖水渠等劳动的时候，他们受到了感动。使他们逐渐认识到劳动者的政治地位已经提高了，视劳动为光荣的观念在新疆人民中已初步建立了起来。
    过去串门子，闲荡的二流子，今年有了地种且在社会风气的压力和农会的监督下，已开始劳动生产。仅莎车区即教育并组织了二流子、流氓等六千一百九十三人参加劳动。妇女也开始参加生产，喀什、迪化、阿克苏、伊犁、焉耆等六专区及迪化市，即有四十九万余妇女参加了修渠、开荒、秋收等生产运动，她们有的并立志要在生产中当女巴图尔（英雄）。多开荒地，多挖水渠，多产粮食，在农村中成为普遍的运动。
    在解放军生产的影响下，新疆农民的耕作方法也开始改进。过去他们种地是不锄草，不间苗也不上肥，撒了种便等着收割的，有些地区还认为野草可以护苗，如伊吾县人民认为“麦地必须有草，没有草，麦也不长”。现在他们也开始拔草了，有的拔了两三遍，少数还有拔五六遍以上的，妇女对拔草很积极。拾粪、上肥、间苗也渐渐成了风气。从今年收成中，农民懂得了：“要多打粮食，非精耕细作不行。”
    今年贫苦农民有了地种和借到种籽后，苦于没有牲口，党、政府和农会便号召在自愿和两利的原则下，组织变工互助组，用人工换取牛工。变工互助组帮助了缺乏生产手段的农民，农民看到了变工组的优点，很愿意接受这种生产组织。
    在阿克苏区即有一百五十余个变工互助组。例如艾利伯勒克村以组长棵子库瓦尔命名的变工组，包括有九户贫农，三户中农，全组有男劳动力十三人，女劳动力十五人，各户所有土地共二百八十亩，有二十五头牛，一匹马，五头驴，五辆大车。今年春耕证明组织起来比单个干更为有利，种冬麦时仍然变工。他们说：“计划不到一世穷，中农帮贫农，贫农帮中农，咱们还是搞变工。”计算时是以每户土地、劳力、牲口、农具等来确定每人多少工，谁也不吃亏。
    新的社会带来新的风气，新的风气涌现了新的人物。新疆农民正以新的劳动态度和新的耕作方法愉快的劳动着。
            二、毛主席、共产党给新疆人民带来了好光景
    新疆农民正过着第一个充满欢笑的丰收的年头。
    “有水便有地”。水在新疆和土地同样的是农民的命根子。但在国民党反动派统治时代，水是为地主、巴爷（有财富的人）所霸占着。如绥来北五岔村地主蒋维明在渠上单辟一道渠，整日整夜地流水，而在下面住的九十户人家，每隔五天才能浇到一次水，喝的水也没有。水价由地主任意规定。如吐鲁番没有河水，需要挖坎儿井水来浇地，坎儿井均为地主所霸占，每当夏秋两季，地主以用剩的水高价卖给农民，有的地区夏季每浇一石地（约合二十五亩），水价是四石小麦，秋季浇一石地要七石高粱。有不少农民因缴不起水价，便只能眼看着自己地里的庄稼枯死旱死。过去常因水的纠纷而闹出人命。解放后，不合理的霸占水利的现象取消了，各处组织了水利委员会，合理地使用水量，调整水价，水利纠纷大为减少。在解放军大力兴修水利的影响和帮助下，经过党、政府、农会的号召和组织，各地人民掀起了修旧渠，挖新渠，凿坎儿井的热潮。
    库车今年修理和新开的水渠达八百六十三条，参加的人数为十九万一千余人。阿克苏新挖水渠一千一百五十六条，修补三百六十条，可以灌溉一万四千八百七十三亩旱田。和阗新挖了干渠二百五十六条，支渠二千五百三十五条。
    有了水，耕地的面积增加了。南疆农民新开荒地共达二十八万七千三百六十八亩，其中和阗县仅第九区开荒即达一万亩以上，迪化专区在个别地区耕地也有增加，如迪化县达坂城区小麦地比去年增加三百八十亩，高粱包谷增加四百九十亩。
    由于采用新的耕作法，今年的产量有了增加。根据疏勒县德义屯村的调查，今年上粪、间苗、锄草的麦地每亩可打十二至十三秤子，包谷和高粱每亩最好的可打到十七、八秤子，而往年麦地每亩只打五至八秤子，包谷和高粱每亩最好的也只能打十三秤子。而且上了粪以后，土地肥沃了，今年六月割了冬麦，接着就可种糜子，秋后歇下，明春再种麦子，两年可以有三次收成。过去是割了冬麦后要歇一个时候，等地力恢复了再种麦子的。
    今年除迪化专区因受乌斯满等土匪骚扰未能及时下种，及伊犁、塔城专区因气候突变致使产量降低外，农业生产在其他地区大约提高了百分之二十，有的县甚至提高了百分之二十五至百分之三十的。南疆三十个县有九百万亩耕地，其中三百万亩麦地每亩最低平均增产三十斤，即夏麦可增产九千万斤；有秋田六百万亩，每亩平均增产十六斤，可增产九千六百万斤。今年南疆增产粮食一亿八千六百万斤。
    生产量的增加，在新疆的最西南端，靠近苏联吉尔吉斯共和国的乌恰县，看得更为明显。
    乌恰县是新疆柯尔克孜民族的聚居地，往年他们粮食大部分要从喀什运去，今年种上了地，当地缺粮不多了，比往年少运了百分之六十至八十的粮食。而且因为生活好过了，原来流落在别处谋生的柯尔克滋人也都回到了乌恰县。解放时，当地只八九千人，现已增至一万一千多人。他们说这是共产党和解放军拯救了他们，现在的生活是有生以来从没有见过的。
    好年成加上合理负担的征粮政策，农产品价格的提高（过去国民党反动派是用压低农产品，提高工业品的不等价交换来剥削农民的，如迪化去年约需五石小麦换一匹卡叽布，现在一匹卡叽布要不了一石小麦），农民的生活有了改善。
    奇台七乡农会委员余同春，今年家里七口人全穿上了蓝卡叽布的新衣，过去他们做梦也想不到会穿卡叽布衣服的。
    阿克苏艾利伯勒克村有三家贫苦农民今年买了牲畜，盖起房子，有四个光身汉娶了媳妇。当了十五年雇工的木沙的，今年种上十亩地，过去衣不遮体，今年穿上了好粗布衣服，而且还用二塔合（每塔合一六○斤）麦子买了一头牛和一辆大车。
    疏勒县德义屯村最穷的一户易努斯，去年一年三口人只吃过两次白面（五斤）和五斤肉，今年种上了地，每天可吃到一顿白面，每月可吃一斤半肉。今年冬天三人买了一双靴子，他的老婆和孩子穿上了一套新衣。
    同样的例子还可以举出很多。农民生活的日渐改善和购买力的日渐提高，使他们对共产党、人民政府和解放军赞不绝口，农民说：
    “毛主席共产党给咱带来的好光景。”
            三、游牧民族的新发展
    新疆辽阔的平原和肥美的草场，给发展畜牧经济提供了极好的条件。但是主要经营畜牧业的哈萨克和蒙古人民，却一直过着悲惨痛苦的生活。
    解放前，哈、蒙族人民的生活困难，国民党反动派封锁了对苏贸易，牧民的土产销不出去。因为他们四季都要移动，冬天要到深山里进“冬窝子”，遇到雪灾、风灾埋住了草便使牲口大批死亡，人民的文化、教育和卫生是谈不上的。部落内部的死亡率很大。哈族人民历年来受乌斯满匪首的压迫和剥削，当乌斯满匪首在一九四七年被伊、塔、阿三区革命力量驱出阿山时，原在阿山的哈族哈拉哈斯、米力提、莫力河三个部落被胁迫着同时从阿山迁移至木垒河、阜康等地，三年来因被迫要供给乌匪壮丁、马匹和牛羊，三个部落牲口减少了三分之二，死亡的人比出生的还多。聚居在焉耆和靖地区的蒙古族人民中，性病流行，死亡率很大。伊犁专区巩哈县蒙古人，在一九四四年有四千余人，现仅三千余人。
    哈族和蒙古族人民以前是日趋没落，向下坡的路上走的；解放后，他们有了新的，向上的发展前途。
    对苏联的贸易恢复了，牧民的土产有了销路。今年贸易公司为了照顾牧民生活，土产品收购的价格都提高了。例如羊肠由去年每根四元提高到三十三元，羊皮每张由十元八角提高到五十元，羊毛由每百公斤六百元提高为一千七百余元（均为新疆币，每元合人民币四百五十元）。阿山去年牧民一百根羊肠只换到（本处原稿不清）斜纹布十九点二公尺，现在可换到青哇卡叽布七十六点九公尺。牧民的收入增加了，再加上今年牧税减轻（采取自报调查、依率累进计征办法，羊以十只为起征点，农业耕畜不足三只者不征税），牧民的生活有了改善。以前喝不上茶叶的牧民，现在能喝上茶叶，以前穿不上衣服的牧民，现在添制了新衣。
    游牧部落在逐渐定居和向半农半牧方向发展，牧民的生活在逐渐改善。他们相信共产党和人民政府已把他们从贫困没落的境遇中拯救出来了。他们正以英勇、豪爽的民族传统，确信着自己民族有着向前发展进步的辉煌远景。十月间，苏联文艺工作者代表团曾来到新疆访问和演奏，他们看到在苏联多民族的大家庭中，乌兹贝克斯坦共和国等在经济、政治、文化、教育各方面已有了巨大成就，更坚定地相信在中华人民共和国多民族的大家庭中，他们的民族同样有宽广的发展前途。
                一九五○年十二月二十四日于迪化
