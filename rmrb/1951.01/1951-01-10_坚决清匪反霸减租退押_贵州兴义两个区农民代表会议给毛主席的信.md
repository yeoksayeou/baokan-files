Resolutely Eliminate Bandits, Oppose Tyranny, Reduce Rent, and Return Deposits
    — A Letter from Farmers' Representatives of Two Districts in Xingyi, Guizhou to Chairman Mao

To Chairman Mao of the Central People's Government:

    We, the farmers of Xingyi, like farmers all over the country, have stood up united under your wise leadership. We, the 609 farmer representatives from Huangcaozhen, Huancheng District, Xingyi County, and the newly opened Chongren District, have been holding our first representative meeting with great excitement and joy since December 1, 1950, enthusiastically discussing our emancipation cause. Now the meeting has come to an end. In addition to guaranteeing the implementation of the conference's resolutions with strong confidence and heroic practical actions, quickly completing the six historical tasks of eliminating bandits, opposing tyranny, autumn grain collection, reducing rent, returning deposits, and banning opium, in order to achieve our farmers' complete liberation, we especially extend our highest respect to you—the savior of us farmers!

    The entire body of representatives from the Farmers' Representative Meeting of Huangcaozhen, Huancheng District, and Chongren District, Xingyi County, Guizhou Province.
