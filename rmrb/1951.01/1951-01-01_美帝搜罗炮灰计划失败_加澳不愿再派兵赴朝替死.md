　　U.S. Imperialism's Plan to Scrounge for Cannon Fodder Fails
    Canada and Australia Unwilling to Send More Troops to Korea to Die as Substitutes
    [Xinhua News Agency, 31st] As the U.S. invading army in Korea encounters shameful defeats, and U.S. aggressors loudly threaten their puppet states to provide more cannon fodder, even Canada and Australia, which have always most strongly supported U.S. aggression, are openly expressing their unwillingness to send more cannon fodder to die as substitutes for the U.S. aggressors.
    The "New York Times," mouthpiece of the U.S. ruling clique, on the 28th, once again threatened the U.S. puppet states to "make more concrete contributions to the military operations in Korea" and go to "aid U.S. troops." The newspaper clamored: "Now is about the time for the United Nations to share the burden of the Korean war more fairly."
    However, according to a report by the United Press on the 28th: "The Canadian Department of National Defence issued a communiqué stating: Of the Canadian advance force sent to Korea this autumn, except for 45 who will remain, the remaining 300 will return home within this month." Originally, this advance force of 345 people was to prepare for a brigade of Canadian cannon fodder already promised to go to Korea. That brigade had already been sent to the U.S. base, Fort Lewis, in November to concentrate for training. Following the failure of the U.S. invading army in Korea, the Canadian authorities, on the one hand, sent a battalion to Korea to barely meet U.S. demands, and on the other hand, were unwilling to send the brigade of troops in the U.S. to Korea, and announced the withdrawal of the advance force of this brigade. A spokesman for the Canadian Department of National Defence admitted: "This move makes it very clear that the decision has now been made not to send the soldiers from Fort Lewis to Korea."
    At the same time, the Australian Minister for the Interior and Minister for Defence, McBride, announced on the 28th: Australia will no longer send Australian troops to Korea. He said: Australia will only maintain the one battalion of Australian troops already in Korea, keeping it fully manned.

### 美帝搜罗炮灰计划失败  加澳不愿再派兵赴朝替死

　　美帝搜罗炮灰计划失败  
    加澳不愿再派兵赴朝替死
    【新华社三十一日讯】当美国侵略军在朝鲜遭遇到可耻失败、美国侵略者大声要胁各仆从国家提供更多炮灰的时候，甚至连一向支持美国侵略最力的加拿大和澳大利亚，也公开表示不愿再出炮灰去为美国侵略者替死。
    美国统治集团的喉舌“纽约时报”二十八日再次要胁美国各仆从国家“对朝鲜的军事作战作更具体的贡献”，并前往“援助美国部队”。该报大叫：“现在大约是联合国之间更公平地分担朝鲜作战的负担的时候了。”
    但据合众社二十八日电透露：“加拿大国防部发表公报称：今秋派往朝鲜的加拿大先头部队中，除了四十五名留下外，其余三百名将于本月内回国。”原来这支三百四十五人的先头部队，是替加拿大早已答应的一旅炮灰去朝鲜做准备工作的。该旅军队则已在十一月份开到美国的基地路易斯炮台集中受训。随着美国侵略军在朝鲜的失败，加拿大当局一方面派遣一个营到朝鲜，聊以应付美国的要求，另一方面就不愿再把在美国的一旅军队送到朝鲜去，而宣布撤回这旅军队的先头部队。加拿大国防部的发言人承认：“此举说明，现在已经非常明确地决定不派路易斯炮台的士兵到朝鲜去了。”
    同时，澳大利亚的内政部长兼国防部长麦克布莱德在二十八日宣布：以后不再派遣澳大利亚军队前往朝鲜。他说：澳大利亚今后只维持已在朝鲜的一营澳车，使其满员。
