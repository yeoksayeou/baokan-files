　　Beijing Volunteer Surgical Team at the Front
    Chang Yuchao
    The Beijing Anti-American Volunteer Surgical Team, volunteering to serve at the front, is demonstrating a high degree of revolutionary humanitarianism, wholeheartedly carrying out the work of treating the wounded.
    On the journey to the front, they were met with love and respect everywhere. Once, on a train, the conductor enthusiastically read out the first letter of慰问 (condolences/appreciation) to them. It was written by the passengers on the train. When they heard: "All the passengers on the train salute you! The people of China salute you!" all the team members were moved to tears and couldn't help but shout with the passengers, "Down with American imperialism!" "Long live the unity of the Chinese and Korean people!" "Swear to defend the safety of the motherland!"
    The closer they got to the front, the higher their confidence and enthusiasm became. Deputy Team Leader He Yunqiao said: "I'm fifty years old, and I've never served the country and the people like this before. This time, I'm determined to do my best!"
    They arrived at their work location on November 30th last year. Although the workload was very heavy, and the working environment and equipment were difficult, everyone was filled with a high sense of responsibility and compassion for the current work. Team Leader Dr. Chen Jingyun expressed angrily when he saw the wounded who had been injured by American planes: "I will do my best to serve the wounded wholeheartedly and heal them."
    At the front, they met with the Shanghai Surgical Team led by female model medical worker Li Landing. They listened to Li Landing's report on the medical work during the arduous struggles of the Anti-Japanese War and the Liberation War, and everyone was very moved. Liu Fangying (a nurse from Peking University Hospital) said in a letter she sent back: "Her report gave me a great education, and made me realize that a revolutionary fighter with a firm stand must do her best to do her job in any difficult environment, use wisdom and courage to overcome difficulties and create favorable conditions; if necessary, sacrifice herself. But when one person falls, there are thousands more behind, and the revolution will eventually be victorious!"
    I interviewed the families of the Beijing Surgical Team in Beijing. They were all deeply honored that their husbands or children were participating in this work. Dr. Chen Jingyun's wife, Bu Chunsheng, said excitedly: "Dr. Chen has been back in the motherland for less than eight months, and it is fortunate that he can have this opportunity to train himself and serve the people." She and the children wrote letters to the front to encourage him. The eldest son, Wen Tai, fourteen years old, wrote in his letter: "I hope you will make more contributions at the front." He Yunqiao's sixty-eight-year-old father said in a cheerful voice: "He wrote in his letters home that he is very well at the front and that the local people are taking good care of him, so I am not worried. We must have a country before we can have a home. When the country needs us, we should do our part." The Central People's Hospital, the North China People's Hospital, Peking University Hospital, and the Beijing Municipal Public Health Bureau have all sent people to慰问 (express sympathy and solicitude). The Ministry of Health also sent letters of慰问 (condolences/appreciation) to the families of the surgical team in the New Year. The families expressed their deep gratitude for these warm expressions of care. They deeply knew that their loved ones would successfully complete their tasks and return triumphantly.

　　北京志愿手术队在前方
    常愈超
    志愿赴前方服务的北京市抗美援朝手术队，正在前方发扬高度的革命人道主义，全心全意地进行医疗伤员的工作。
    在开赴前方的旅途中，他们到处受到人们的热爱和尊敬。有一次，在列车上，车上的列车长就向他们热情地宣读了第一封慰问信，那是火车上乘客们写的，当他们听到：“全车的乘客都向你们致敬！全中国的人民都向你们致敬”时，全体队员们都感动得热泪盈眶，情不自禁地和旅客们同声高呼“打倒美帝国主义！”“中朝人民团结万岁！”“誓死保卫祖国安全！”
    越接近前方，他们的信心和热情越高。贺云翘副队长说：“我活了五十岁，没有这样对国家人民服务过，这次，决心用我的一切力量干一下！”
    去年十一月三十日到了工作地点，工作任务虽然非常艰巨，工作环境与器材的配备也有困难，但是，每一个人对当前的工作，都充满了高度的责任心与同情心。大队长陈景云大夫看见美帝飞机炸伤的伤员，愤恨地表示：“我一定要尽一切努力，全心全意为伤员服务，治好他们。”
    他们在前方，与女模范医务工作者李兰丁所率领的上海市手术队会了师，他们听了李兰丁关于抗日战争及解放战争中艰苦斗争的医疗工作报告，每一个人都非常感动。刘芳英（北大医院的护士）在寄回的信中说：“她的报告给了我极大的教育，使我认识了一个立场坚定的革命战士，在任何困难的环境中，都要尽自己最大的力量做好工作，利用智慧与勇气克服困难，创造有利条件；万不得已时，牺牲个人。但是一个人倒下去，还有千万个在后面，革命终究是要胜利的！”
    我访问了北京手术队在京的家属们。他们都深以他们的丈夫或子女参加这个工作为光荣。陈景云大夫的夫人步春生兴奋地说：“陈大夫回到祖国不到八个月，能够有这种机会锻炼自己，为人民服务，是值得庆幸的。”她和孩子们都写信到前方去鼓励他。十四岁的长子文泰写信说：“希望你在前方多立功。”贺云翘副队长的六十八岁的老父亲用愉快的声音说：“他写家信来说，在前方很好，当地人民照顾得极周到，所以我并不挂念，有国才能有家，国家需要我们时，就应当出力。”中央人民医院、华北人民医院、北大医院及北京市公共卫生局等单位都曾派人去慰问过他们。中央卫生部在新年中也曾向手术队家属致函慰问，家属们对于这些热情的关怀，深表感激。他们深深知道他们的亲人们一定会胜利地完成任务，凯旋归来。
