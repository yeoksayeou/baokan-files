Textual Research on the Centenary Anniversary of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Uprising
    Luo Ergang
    The date of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Uprising is a matter of diverse opinions in the early history of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. From the official books of the Heavenly Kingdom to the writings of Heavenly Kingdom figures and Chinese and foreign historical records, there are nine different versions:
    1.  "Autobiography of Loyal King Li Xiucheng" states that the uprisings of congregations in various places occurred on the same day in the sixth month of the summer of the thirtieth year of Daoguang. Du Wenlan's "Records of the Pacification of the Guangdong Bandits," Wang Ding'an's "Xiang Army Records," and "Guangxu Xuzhou Prefecture Chronicle" also state that it was in June of that year, which should be based on the "Autobiography of the Loyal King."
    2.  "Autobiography of Prince Zun Lai Wenguang" states that it was in the autumn of the thirtieth year of Daoguang.
    3.  Chen Zhengyan's "Wuchang Records" states that it was on the third day of the ninth month of the thirtieth year of Daoguang.
    4.  Meadows' "The Chinese and their Rebellions" states that it was around the beginning of October 1850.
    5.  The "Book of Heavenly Principles" promulgated by the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom contains the phrase "Camping at Jintian, on the first day of the tenth month."
    6.  Yan Zhengji's "On the Beginning and End of Military Affairs Concerning the Guangdong Western Bandit Situation" states that it was in October of the thirtieth year of Daoguang, as does Zhang Dejian's "Collection of Bandit Situation."
    7.  Wang Tao's handwritten manuscript "Xie Jiehe's Brief Records of Jinling Gui Jia" states that it was on the tenth day of the eleventh month of the thirtieth year of Daoguang.
    8.  Brine's "Taeping Rebellion in China" states that it was around the twelfth day of November or the beginning of January 1851.
    9.  "Autobiography of Prince Gan Hong Rengan" states that it was on the tenth day of the twelfth month of the thirtieth year of Daoguang, the day of Hong Xiuquan's birthday, that the uprising took place in Jintian.
    Of these nine versions, the fifth, "Book of Heavenly Principles," is an official book of the Heavenly Kingdom; the first, second, and ninth are autobiographies of figures of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom; the third, sixth, and seventh are important Chinese historical records; and the fourth and eighth are well-known Western works recording the events of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. The accounts in the various books differ so greatly. Leaving aside the Chinese and Western records of the time, even the official books of the Heavenly Kingdom and the autobiographies of its leaders differ so much. Are these their mistakes? Or is it that we historians have not been able to find the clues to the development of the events at that time, so that we cannot obtain a correct understanding?
    Before 1935, the "Book of Heavenly Principles" and the "Autobiography of Prince Gan Hong Rengan" had not yet been discovered. At that time, there were only seven versions. We also had not yet seen the "Original Manuscript of the Autobiography of Loyal King Collected by the Zeng Family of Xiangxiang." Therefore, when I wrote "A History of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom," my view on this issue was that Loyal King did not participate in the Jintian Uprising. He only joined the army as a soldier when the Taiping army attacked Yong'an Prefecture and passed through his hometown. He was not a party involved, so his statement should not be readily believed. Prince Zun Lai Wenguang narrated that he followed the Heavenly King in the uprising at Jintian. He was a party involved, and his statement should be believed. However, I believe that the "Autobiography of Prince Zun Lai Wenguang" that we see today is a copied version, and perhaps there are inevitable errors. The other statements have not presented any strong evidence. Only Xie Jiehe's "Brief Records of Jinling Gui Jia" stated that he had seen the official history of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. In his book, in the "Biography of Heavenly King Hong Xiuquan" and "Biography of Eastern King Yang Xiuqing," both state that the Jintian Uprising took place on the tenth day of the eleventh month of the thirtieth year of Daoguang. I believed that since Xie had seen the official history of the Heavenly Kingdom, this date should be based on the historical books he had seen. I compared the various statements and believed that Xie's statement was more credible, so I followed Xie's statement. This was my initial opinion on this issue.
    In the spring of 1937, when I wrote "A Chronicle of Hong Xiuquan Before the Jintian Uprising," the "Book of Heavenly Principles" and "Autobiography of Prince Gan Hong Rengan" were both discovered. Thus, the seven different versions of the date of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Uprising became nine different versions. Because of the discovery of new historical materials, I began to question my previous views. One day, I carefully read Zhang Dejian's "Collection of Bandit Situation" to Volume 4, Pseudo-Family Records, after the Second Army Commander Liang Litai, and noted:
    Thirty-four years old, from Baisha Market, Guiping County, Xuzhou Prefecture, Guangxi. He joined the camp in Jintian in July of the Gengxu year, was appointed as the commander of the former camp, Dong Liang Sima in August, and promoted to the brigade commander of the former camp in September.
    The Gengxu year in this case is July of the thirtieth year of Daoguang. Liang Litai is from Baisha Market in Guiping County, which is the Baisha mentioned in the "Autobiography of Loyal King Li Xiucheng" as rising up on the same day as Jintian, Huazhou, Luchuan, and Bobai. This record had not been noticed before, but when I saw it that day, it suddenly dawned on me. I thought that since Litai was from Baisha, after the Society of God Worshippers mobilized in Baisha, it would have taken them several days to bring their families to Jintian to meet up. Since he joined the camp in Jintian in July, then the day when Hong Xiuquan issued a general mobilization order to the Society of God Worshippers in Jintian, Baisha, and other places must have been before this time. Using this record and the statement in "Li Xiucheng's Autobiography" that the uprising was in June as a reference, doesn't it prove that Xiucheng's words are not wrong? I then compared the "Autobiography of Prince Zun Lai Wenguang," "Book of Heavenly Principles," "Autobiography of Prince Gan Hong Rengan," and the events recorded in various books at that time with the "Liang Litai Family Records" and "Autobiography of Loyal King Li Xiucheng," and I arrived at an explanation that could connect the records of the Heavenly Kingdom's official books and the Heavenly Kingdom's leaders: The date of the general mobilization of the revolutionary movement of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom for the congregations in various places was approximately June of the thirtieth year of Daoguang, but this was the date of the general mobilization and not the date of the uprising. After the general mobilization in June, the dates on which the congregations gathered in various places varied. Therefore, Liang Litai, a Baisha native, arrived in Jintian and joined the camp in July. Prince Zun Lai Wenguang was probably not from Jintian either, and it was already autumn when he arrived in Jintian and joined the camp. Therefore, he said, "Recalling that I grew up in western Guangdong, I was fortunate to accompany my Heavenly King's holy carriage to advocate righteousness at Jintian in the autumn of Daoguang Gengxu." On the first day of the tenth month, most of the congregations in various places had arrived in Jintian one after another, and thus there was the camping. Therefore, the Book of Heavenly Principles says: "Camping at Jintian, on the first day of the tenth month," for this reason. At this time, although Jintian had already camped, there had not yet been an uprising. While in the process of deployment, Hong Xiuquan was trapped in Huazhou Shanren Village in Pingnan County, and Yang Xiuqing led his troops to rescue him, defeating the Qing army at Siwang Market and welcoming Hong Xiuquan back. The Qing army came to pursue them and fought again at Jintian, defeating the Qing army greatly. On the tenth day of the twelfth month, Hong Xiuquan's birthday ①, on this day, he officially declared the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom and launched the uprising in Jintian. Therefore, the "Autobiography of Prince Gan Hong Rengan" says: "At that time, the Heavenly King was stationed at Hu Yihuang's house in Huazhou, and he held a grand meeting for all the teams to come to Huazhou to welcome the holy carriage, and together they went to Jintian to respectfully celebrate the birthday and launch the uprising, officially declaring the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom." Thus, based on my new understanding, I wrote the book "A Chronicle of Hong Xiuquan" in the early summer of 1937.
    However, I believe that although my explanation is derived from integrating various records of the Heavenly Kingdom and deducing them, it should still be regarded as a hypothesis to be proven, and evidence is needed to prove it. There are two key points for whether this hypothesis can be established: First, did the Society of God Worshippers in Jintian, Huazhou, Luchuan, Bobai, Baisha, and other places "rise up on the same day" in June of the thirtieth year of Daoguang, as stated in the "Autobiography of Loyal King Li Xiucheng"? Second, was the Jintian Uprising of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom definitely on the day of Hong Xiuquan's birthday, the tenth day of the twelfth month of the thirtieth year of Daoguang, as stated in the "Autobiography of Prince Gan Hong Rengan"? If we get a negative answer to the first point, we can overthrow the statement in the "Autobiography of Loyal King Li Xiucheng" that the uprising was in June. If we get a positive answer to the second point, we can confirm the statement of Prince Gan Hong Rengan that the uprising was officially declared on the day of Hong Xiuquan's birthday, the tenth day of the twelfth month of the thirtieth year of Daoguang, and our hypothesis can be established.
    Regarding the first point of textual research, I went to Guiping in the spring of 1944 to participate in the completion ceremony of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Memorial Hall. In the memorial hall, there was a silk-written "Letter from Young Assistant King Meng Shiyong to Uncle and Other Family Letters," in which there was a passage about the uprising:
    In the Gengxu year, in the second month, we respectfully worshiped Heavenly Father God and Heavenly Brother Jesus… On the thirteenth day of the ninth month, the Huazhou camp was formed, and the nephew set off from Zhang Wu's house in Zewei Village, Huahuangshui, on the eighteenth day of this month to go to Huazhou.
    In this case, Meng Shiyong participated in the Jintian Uprising. This is a document from a party involved. According to his record, the Huazhou camp was formed on the thirteenth day of the ninth month of the Gengxu year, the thirtieth year of Daoguang, and not in June of that year. Furthermore, according to the "Guangxu Yulin Prefecture Chronicle," the uprising of the Society of God Worshippers in Luchuan and Bobai was in September, the "Republican Luchuan Chronicle" says August, Liang Litai from Baisha joined the camp in Jintian in July, and the Jintian camp was formed on the first day of the tenth month. Based on the facts listed above, it is known that the dates of the gatherings of the Society of God Worshippers in various places were not the same, which proves that there was no "same day uprising" of the congregations in Jintian, Huazhou, Luchuan, Bobai, Baisha, and other places in June of the thirtieth year of Daoguang. However, we still cannot understand why Loyal King Li Xiucheng said this. Coincidentally, the Guangxi Tongzhi Hall photographed and copied the "Original Manuscript of the Autobiography of Loyal King Li Xiucheng" from the Zeng family in Xiangxiang and asked me to conduct textual research on this manuscript. I participated in the completion ceremony of the memorial hall and went to Guilin, where I saw the "Original Manuscript of the Autobiography of Loyal King." It turns out that his original text recording the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Uprising was like this:
    In June of the thirtieth year of Daoguang, Jintian, Huazhou, Luchuan, Bobai, and Baisha rose up on the same day… At this time, I was at home when I learned of the news of the Jintian Uprising. Someone from the Society of God Worshippers brought the news to my home, but I did not go and remained at home.
    The edition of Zeng Guofan's "Autobiography of Loyal King" deleted the thirty words from "At this time, I was at home" onwards, which is why we do not understand the source of Li Xiucheng's information and the reason for his error. Now that we have read the original manuscript, we understand. It teaches us that when Hong Xiuquan issued the order for the general mobilization of the congregations in various places, he sent people to inform the members of the congregations door-to-door. Li Xiucheng's home was in Xinwang Village, Changgongli, Teng County, and someone from the Society of God Worshippers also came to his home to inform him. The time when Hong Xiuquan issued the general mobilization order was June of the thirtieth year of Daoguang. Because Li Xiucheng was at home and did not go to Jintian to participate, he received the order in June. He did not understand that this was the order for general mobilization, and the uprising had not yet occurred at this time. On the tenth day of the twelfth month of that year, the Heavenly King's birthday, he officially declared the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom and launched the uprising in Jintian. He did not participate at that time, so when he later wrote his autobiography, he mistakenly believed that the day he received the general mobilization order was the day of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Uprising. Furthermore, because the general mobilization was launched simultaneously to various places, he mistakenly believed that "Jintian, Huazhou, Luchuan, Bobai, and Baisha rose up on the same day." Although the "Autobiography of Loyal King" has this error, it recorded extremely important historical events for us, allowing us to know that before the Jintian Uprising, Hong Xiuquan issued the order for the general mobilization of the congregations in various places in June of the thirtieth year of Daoguang, calling on them to gather in Jintian. Since we have seen the "Original Manuscript of the Autobiography of Loyal King," we can definitively determine that June of the thirtieth year of Daoguang was the day when the Society of God Worshippers launched the revolution of the congregations, and not the day of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Uprising.
    Regarding the second point of textual research, we obtained an extremely important piece of evidence. In the "Collection of Bandit Situation," Volume 3, Fake Official System, Fake Official Titles, Class of Merits, the note under Adding One Rank of Merit says:
    All those who celebrated Hong Xiuquan's birthday in Jintian, regardless of the size of their fake positions, were given the five characters "Adding One Rank of Merit."
    Hong Xiuquan celebrated his birthday in Jintian, Yong'an, and also in Tianjing. Why was it only that those who participated in celebrating his birthday in Jintian on the tenth day of the twelfth month of the thirtieth year of Daoguang were given "Adding One Rank of Merit"? The reason why the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom specially gave titles to those who were in Jintian in this year must have had significance beyond celebrating Hong Xiuquan's birthday. The explanation in the "Collection of Bandit Situation" did not include all the meaning. When we refer to the "Autobiography of Prince Gan Hong Rengan," we understand that the tenth day of the twelfth month of the thirtieth year of Daoguang was both Hong Xiuquan's birthday and the day when the Jintian Uprising was officially declared. In addition to Rengan's autobiography, we can also find proof in the documents of Li Xingyuan, the chief commander and imperial envoy of the Qing Dynasty at the time. Li Xingyuan's "Letter to Governor Luo Yumen" on the twentieth day of the twelfth month of the thirtieth year of Daoguang says: "A group in Guiping and Jintian Village formed a society and usurped the title, gathering more than ten thousand people"②. On the same day, the "Memorial for Planning to Suppress the Jintian Rebels and Requesting the Transfer of Senior Officers for Joint Suppression" also says, "The bandit leaders in Jintian Village, Wei Zheng, Hong Xiuquan, and others, privately formed the Society of Worshipping the Brother God, arbitrarily posted fake titles and fake notices, recruiting more than ten thousand wandering bandits, and engaging in illegal activities"③. In this case, the Jintian Uprising was officially declared on the tenth day of the twelfth month. Ten days later, Li Xingyuan, the chief commander of the Qing Dynasty stationed in Liuzhou, received intelligence that the Taiping army had "usurped the title," saying that he "arbitrarily posted fake titles and fake notices." This record proves that Rengan's record of "Respectfully celebrating the birthday and launching the uprising, officially declaring the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom" is accurate. It can be known that the reason why the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, after establishing its capital in Tianjing, gave titles to all those who were in Jintian on the tenth day of the twelfth month of the thirtieth year of Daoguang was to reward them for their merits in the Jintian Uprising. Therefore, the date of the Jintian Uprising, the tenth day of the twelfth month of the thirtieth year of Daoguang, is not only proven by Hong Rengan's autobiography, but also by the Heavenly Kingdom's system of military ranks. This is certain and unchangeable. Here, we must also incidentally deduce the reason why Xie Jiehe's "Brief Records of Jinling Gui Jia" recorded the date of the Jintian Uprising as the tenth day of the eleventh month. According to Xie's own account, he had seen the official history of the Heavenly Kingdom, but his record was written after he left Tianjing and recalled the events. When he was in Tianjing reading the Heavenly Kingdom's history books, he knew that the Jintian Uprising was on the tenth day of the twelfth month of the thirtieth year of Daoguang, but when he left Tianjing and recalled the events of the Heavenly Kingdom, he mistakenly remembered the tenth day of the twelfth month as the tenth day of the eleventh month due to memory errors. This is a common occurrence. Today, we have researched the date of the Jintian Uprising and can know that Xie's error was due to memory errors.
    My textual research on the above issue of the date of the Jintian Uprising, from the time I wrote "A History of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom" in 1935 until I saw the "Original Manuscript of the Autobiography of Loyal King" in 1944, took nine years before I dared to draw a conclusion: "The date when the revolutionary movement of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom issued the order for the general mobilization of the Society of God Worshippers in various places was June of the thirtieth year of Daoguang, but at this time, the Jintian Uprising had not yet occurred. The mobilization order was dispatched to the homes of members in various places by cadres. The dates on which members in various places gathered varied. After camping in Jintian and welcoming Hong Xiuquan back to Jintian, on the tenth day of the twelfth month of this year, the day of Xiuquan's birthday, they celebrated Xiuquan's birthday, officially declared the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, and launched the uprising in Jintian, announcing it far and wide to attack the Qing Dynasty. Later, when the capital was established in Tianjing, the Heavenly Kingdom rewarded merits and awarded titles to all those who participated in the uprising in Jintian on this day, regardless of their position, adding the title of 'Adding One Rank of Merit' to commemorate the merits of the uprising."
    Based on the conclusion of the above textual research, it is known that the date of the Jintian Uprising was the tenth day of the twelfth month of the thirtieth year of Qing Daoguang, which is January 11, 1851. Therefore, the centenary anniversary of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Uprising should be January 11, 1951.
    ①Hong Xiuquan was born on the tenth day of the twelfth month of the eighteenth year of Qing Jiaqing, see my book "Chronicle of Hong Xiuquan Before the Jintian Uprising" for details.
    ②See "Collected Writings of Li Wengong," Volume 9.
    ③See "Memorials and Discussions of Li Wengong," Volume 21.

　　太平天国起义百年纪念日期的考证
    罗尔纲
    太平天国起义日期是太平天国初期史上一个异说纷歧的问题。自天国官书所载，以至天国人物的撰述与中外史籍所记，计共有九种不同的说法：
    一、“忠王李秀成自传”说在清道光三十年夏六月各处会众同日起义。杜文澜“平定粤匪纪略”王定安“湘军记”及“光绪浔州府志”也说在是年六月，当是据自“忠王自传”。
    二、“遵王赖文光自传”说在道光三十年秋。
    三、陈征言“武昌纪事”说在道光三十年九月初三日。
    四、密它士（Meadows）“中国叛党志”（The Chinese and their Rebellion）说约在一八五○年十月初间。
    五、太平天国颁行的“天情道理书”有“金田团营，时维十月初一日”的话。
    六、严正基“论粤西贼情兵事始末”说在道光三十年十月，张德坚贼情汇纂同。
    七、王韬手钞本“谢介鹤金陵癸甲纪事略”说在道光三十年十一月初十日
    八、白伦（Brine）“中国太平叛党志”（Taeping Rebellion in  China（说约在一八五○年十一月十二月或一八五一年一月初。
    九、“干王洪仁玕自传”说在道光三十年十二月初十，洪秀全生日那一天，在金田起义。
    这九种说法第五种“天情道理书”是天国官书，第一、第二、第九三种是太平天国人物自传，第三、第六、第七三种是中文重要史籍，第四、第八两种，是西文记载太平天国事有名的著作，而各书说法不同如此，我们且撇开当时中西纪载不论，即天国官书与其领导人物的自叙，亦复如此歧异，究竟是他们的错误呢？还是我们治史的人寻不出当时事变发展的线索以致得不到正确的了解呢？
    在一九三五年以前，“天情道理书”和“干王洪仁玕自传”两种尚未发现，那时候只有七种说法，而湘乡“曾氏藏忠王自传原稿”，我们也还不曾得看见，所以那时候我写“太平天国史纲”对这个问题看法，以为忠王未参加金田起义，他到太平军攻永安州，路经他的家乡时，才以伍卒参军，他不是当事人，其说不应贸然置信。遵王赖文光自述随天王起义于金田，他是个当事人，其说应该相信了。但我认为今所见的“遵王赖文光自传”，乃传钞之本，或许不免有讹误。而其他诸说，也不曾举出什么坚强的证据。独谢介鹤“金陵癸甲纪事略”自述曾得见太平天国官修史，其书中在“天王洪秀全传”“东王杨秀清传”两处同说金田起义在道光三十年十一月初十日，我以为谢氏既得见天国官修史，此处日期当系据自所见史书，我比较诸说，认为谢说较可信，所以便从了谢氏之说。这是我最初对这个问题的意见。
    到一九三七年春，我写“金田起义前洪秀全年谱”时，“天情道理书”“干王洪仁玕自传”，都发现了，于是太平天国起义日期七种不同的说法便成为九种不同的说法了。因为新史料的发现，使我对以前的看法起了疑问。有一天，我细读张德坚“贼情汇纂”至卷四伪家册式后二军军帅梁立泰下注道：
    年三十四岁，广西浔州府桂平县白沙墟人，庚戌年七月在金田入营，八月封前营长东两司马，九月升前营旅帅。
    案庚戌年七月，即道光三十年七月，梁立泰是桂平县白沙墟人，即“忠王李秀成自传”所说与金田、花洲、陆川、博白同日起事的白沙，这一条记载从前未注意，那天看了，却叫我忽然省悟，我想立泰既为白沙人，他在白沙随拜上帝会动员后，他们挈家去金田会合应有几天的行程，而他在金田入营之时已为七月，则洪秀全通令金田、白沙各地拜上帝会总动员之日，必在此时以前。以此条记载与“李秀成自传”六月起义之说参证，不是正可证明秀成的话不误吗？我再将“遵王赖文光自传”“天情道理书”“干王洪仁玕自传”以及诸书所载当时事变来与“梁立泰家册”“忠王李秀成自传”互相参订，于是我便得到了一个可以沟通天国官书与天国领导人物记载的解释：太平天国革命运动总动员各地会众的日子，大约是道光三十年六月，但这是总动员的日子而不是起义的日子。自六月总动员之后，各地会众团集的日子有先后，所以白沙人梁立泰七月到金田入营，遵王赖文光大约也不是金田人，他到金田入营时已是秋天了，所以他才有“忆余生长粤西，得伴我天王圣驾于道光庚戌秋倡义金田”的话。到了十月初一日，各地会众大部分陆续都到金田集中了，于是遂有团营之举，故天情道理书说：“金田团营，时维十月初一日”，就是这个缘故。这时候金田虽已团营，但还没有起义。方在部署间，而洪秀全被困于平南县花洲山人村，杨秀清乃率众往援，破清军于思旺墟，迎洪秀全归，清军来追，复战于金田，大破清军。到了十二月初十日，洪秀全生日①，就在这一天正号太平天国，起义于金田，所以“干王洪仁玕自传”说：“时天王在花洲胡以晃家驻跸，乃大会各队齐到花洲迎接圣驾，合到金田恭祝万寿起义，正号太平天国”。于是我便根据了我的新认识，在一九三七年初夏撰成了“洪秀全年谱”一书。
    不过，我认为我的解释虽然是融会贯通了天国各种记载推断得来的，但仍应视为待证的假设，还要证据为之证明。这个假设能否成立，其关键有两点：第一，当时金田、花洲、陆川、博白、白沙等地拜上帝会，是否如“忠王李秀成自传”所说，在道光三十年六月“同日起义”？第二，太平天国金田起义是否确如“干王洪仁玕自传”所说，在道光三十年十二月初十洪秀全生日那一天？如果第一点我们得到了否定的答案，便可以推翻了“忠王李秀成自传”六月起义之说了。如果第二点我们再得到正面的答案，便可以证实了干王洪仁玕所说道光三十年十二月初十洪秀全生日那一天，正号起义之说，我们的假设便可以成立了。
    关于第一点考证，我在一九四四年春天去桂平参加太平天国纪念堂落成典礼，在纪念堂里，陈列有一幅用绢写的幼赞王蒙时雍“致叔上信等家书”，其中有一段说到起义的事情道：
    庚戌年二月敬拜天父上帝天兄耶稣……于九月十三日花洲团营，侄于是月十八日由花黄水之紫薇村张五家起行赴花洲。
    案蒙时雍参加金田起义，这是一封当事人的文件。据他所记花洲团营是在道光三十年庚戌九月十三日，并不在这一年的六月。再考“光绪郁林州志”陆川、博白拜上帝会众起事在九月，“民国陆川志”作八月，白沙人梁立泰却在七月在金田入营，而金田团营，则在十月初一日，据上考所列事实，知各地拜上帝会团集的日期并不一致，即可证当时金田、花洲、陆川、博白、白沙各地会众并没有在道光三十年六月“同日起义”之事。但是忠王李秀成何以有此说呢，我们仍然不得其解。事有恰巧，这时候广西通志馆在湘乡曾家摄影及钞录“忠王李秀成自传原稿”回来，请我考证此稿，我参加了纪念堂落成典礼，就去桂林，得见了“忠王自传原稿”，原来他记太平天国起义原文是这样的：
    道光三十年六月，金田、花洲、陆川、博白、白沙同日起义。……此时我在家知到金田起义之信，有拜上帝人传到家中，后未前去，仍然在家。
    案曾国藩刊本“忠王自传”自“此时我在家”以下三十字，都给曾氏删去，所以使我们不明李秀成得到消息的来源及其致误之故。现在我们读了原稿便明白了，教我们知道当洪秀全发令总动员各地会众革命的时候，曾派人到各处会众家沿门传知，李秀成家在藤县长恭里新旺村，他也得到拜上帝的人到家传知。洪秀全发令总动员之时，便是道光三十年六月，李秀成因为在家未去金田参加，他家在六月得到命令，他不明白这是总动员的命令，这时尚未起义，到了这一年十二月初十天王生日，才正号太平天国，于金田起义，当时他没有去参加，所以他后来撰自传时，便误会以为他得到总动员命令之日，就是太平天国起义的日子，并且因为总动员是同时向各地发动的，他又致误会以为“金田、花洲、陆川、博白、白沙同日起义”“忠王自传”虽有此误，但他却给我们记下了极重要的史迹，使我们知道，金田起义前，在道光三十年六月洪秀全就发布了总动员各地会众的命令，叫他们都到金田集中去。由于得见了“忠王自传原稿”，我们便可以确切地断定道光三十年六月乃是拜上帝会发动会众革命的日子，而并不是太平天国起义的日子。
    关于第二点考证，我们得到一条极重要的证据，在“贼情汇纂”卷三伪官制伪官勋阶条功勋加一等下注说：
    凡在金田与祝洪逆生日者，无论伪职大小，悉加“功勋加一等”五字。
    洪秀全在金田过生日，在永安也过生日，到天京同样也过生日，何以独是在道光三十年十二月初十日在金田参加祝贺他的生日的人都加“功勋加一等”呢？太平天国所以特对这一年在金田的人都加勋位，其意义必有在庆祝洪秀全生日以外的，“贼情汇纂”的解释，是不曾把全部意义都包括尽的。我们参订“干王洪仁玕自传”就明白道光三十年十二月初十日这一天，一方面是洪秀全的生日，同时乃是正号太平天国金田起义的日子，我们除了仁玕自传外，还可以在当时满清主帅钦差大臣李星沅文件里面得到证明，道光三十年十二月二十日星沅“与骆吁门中丞书”说：“桂平、金田村一股，结会僭号，聚众万余”②。同日“会奏筹剿金田逆匪恳调提镇大员协剿折子”又说“金田村贼首韦正，洪秀全等私结尚弟会。擅帖伪号伪示，招集游匪万余，肆行不法”③。案金田正号起义在十二月初十日，过了十天，时驻军在柳州的满清主帅李星沅便接到了太平军“僭号”的情报，说他“擅帖伪号伪示”了。这条记载可证仁玕所说：“恭祝万寿起义，正号太平天国”的记载是真确的。可知后来太平天国建都天京所以对凡在道光三十年十二月初十日在金田的人，都颁给勋位的缘故，实在是要赏他们金田起义的功劳。所以金田起义日期在道光三十年十二月初十这一天，我们不但有洪仁玕自传为证，并且有天国勋阶制度为证，这是确切不移的了。在这里还要附带推论谢介鹤“金陵癸甲纪事略”，所记金田起义日期作十一月初十日之故，据谢氏自述他是曾得见过天国官修史的，但他这部记事，乃是走出天京后追记，他在天京看天国史书时，虽知道金田起义是在道光三十年十二月初十日，但到他离天京追记天国事的时候，因为记忆有误，却把十二月初十日误作十一月初十日了。这是一种常有的事，今天我们考出了金田起义的日子就可知道谢氏的错误，是由于记忆有误的缘故。
    我对上面这个金田起义日期问题的考证，自一九三五年撰“太平天国史纲”时起，一直到一九四四年得见了“忠王自传原稿”止，经过了九年的时间，才敢下了一个断案说：“太平天国革命运动发令总动员各地拜上帝会众的日期，是道光三十年六月，但这时候金田还没有起义。动员令是分派干部到各地会员家中沿门传知的，各地会员得到动员令，团集的日期有先后，到了金田团营迎洪秀全归金田后，就在这年十二月初十日，秀全生日的这一天，庆祝秀全生日，正号太平天国，起义于金田，布告远近，以讨伐满清。后来建都天京，天国论功行赏，凡在这一天在金田参加起义的。不论职位大小，都加‘功勋加一等’勋位，以纪起义的功绩”。
    根据上面考证的结论，知道金田起义的日子是清道光三十年十二月初十日，即公元一八五一年一月十一日，所以太平天国起义百年纪念的日子，应该是一九五一年一月十一日。
