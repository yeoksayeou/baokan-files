　　From the Transformation of Military-Civilian Relations to the Transformation of Ethnic Relations
    ——A Record of the Year of Great Unity Among All Ethnic Groups in Xinjiang
    Hu Zhong
    After the liberation of Xinjiang, due to the Provincial People's Government's implementation of a policy of equality for all ethnic groups, and especially due to the People's Liberation Army's suppression of bandits and production over the past year, social order has been stabilized, military-civilian unity has been strengthened, and it has had a huge impact on all ethnic groups, causing the relations among the various ethnic groups to gradually shift from the abnormal phenomena of oppression, feuds, suspicion, and mistrust of the past towards unity, mutual assistance, and friendly cooperation. This is a fundamental, historical change for Xinjiang.
  I. A New Era of Unity and Friendship
    The Kuomintang reactionary bandit gangs' army has always been the enemy of the people of all ethnic groups. Wherever they lived, they ate there, and they harmed the people there. After the Chinese People's Liberation Army entered Xinjiang, it ended the reactionary rule and ethnic oppression of the Kuomintang bandit gangs in Xinjiang. The people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang expressed warm welcome and support for the People's Liberation Army.
    When the People's Liberation Army entered Dihua, the people of Dihua cheered their liberators with stormy applause. Kazakh people came from over a hundred li away to welcome them; Uyghur people said: "Today, the Uyghurs have stood up along with other ethnic groups in the country."
    The People's Liberation Army stationed in Hotan, in the face of difficulties such as lack of transportation, in order to liberate the people of Hotan more quickly, crossed the Tarim Desert, which was more than 1,560 li long, of which more than 1,300 li were uninhabited. With amazing perseverance in overcoming all difficulties, the troops marched more than a hundred li every day, completing the task of liberating Hotan, creating a rare feat in history; and the people of all ethnic groups in Hotan spontaneously mobilized more than 300 donkeys, 100 camels, and 100 horses to greet the liberating army dozens of li away; 40,000 to 50,000 people welcomed the People's Liberation Army into the city with gongs, drums, ethnic dances, and cheers lining the streets. This had never happened before in Xinjiang's history.
    People of all ethnic groups in other places welcomed and paid tribute to the People's Liberation Army, who had liberated them, with unprecedented joy, erecting colorful arches, beating gongs and drums, and using various languages.
    The People's Liberation Army stationed in Xinjiang are Han working people and an army led by the Chinese Communist Party. The warm welcome of the People's Liberation Army by the people of all ethnic groups reveals the sincere feelings of all ethnic groups. From then on, the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang entered a new era full of unity, friendship, and laughter.
  II. "Heart for Heart"
    Over the past year, the Xinjiang People's Liberation Army has carried out arduous bandit suppression work, basically eliminating the U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek bandit spies Usman and his gang, who harmed the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang and were hated by them, capturing bandit leaders such as Janim Khan, Urazbay, and Sidik alive, and basically stabilizing social order. At the same time, in the gaps between bandit suppression, they also carried out a vigorous production movement. The People's Liberation Army's selfless labor and production over the past year have enabled the troops to be self-sufficient in food for more than half a year. This has reduced the burden on the people, saved on grain transportation costs, improved the lives of the troops, consolidated the uprising troops, and especially changed the social atmosphere of despising labor caused by the long-term rule of the Kuomintang bandit gangs. Moreover, because the troops resolutely implemented the correct ethnic policy in production, helping people of all ethnic groups with plowing, watering, harvesting, and establishing household chores, this laid an unshakable foundation for further friendship and unity among all ethnic groups politically and economically.
    The troops took care of the people of all ethnic groups in the matter of water use, specifically stipulating the method of "watering distant land first, nearby land later, people first, and the army later"; and abolished the unreasonable phenomenon of occupying water conservancy in the past, organized water conservancy committees, and resolved water conservancy disputes over the years. Troops in various places also carried out great projects of digging canals. The canals dug within a year can irrigate more than 1.27 million mu of land. In addition to the troops using the water themselves, the surplus water was supplied to the masses. A howitzer company of a certain regiment repaired a large canal that had been abandoned for more than ten years and four branch canals, giving two branch canals to the masses for use, benefiting several thousand mu of land with irrigation. A certain regiment in Changji helped the masses repair two water canals more than 400 meters long. The water canal in Langgan, 40 li west of Aksu, burst. In the past, it would take more than a month to repair it, but with the assistance of the People's Liberation Army, it was completely repaired in two days, so that the rice fields did not die from drought due to the canal burst. In order to give the masses enough water, a certain army changed the land prepared for planting rice to planting corn. In 1950, the People's Liberation Army cultivated a total of one million mu of wasteland (850,000 mu in spring plowing and more than 100,000 mu in winter wheat), which not only did not hinder the masses from using water, but also gave the masses considerable help in water use. Under the influence of the People's Liberation Army's water conservancy construction, people in various places also set off an unprecedented upsurge in digging canals.
    Some troops distributed the wasteland they had cultivated to poor peasants for planting, and some helped peasants water and harvest. Five Uyghur families in the garrison area of the Fifth Company of a certain regiment planted more than 100 mu of land. After sowing the seeds, they went to Camel Station. Seeing that their crops were about to die, the soldiers automatically watered them for two days. When they came back and saw that the wheat in the field was growing green, they were extremely grateful. A direct unit of a certain army helped the masses harvest more than 500 mu of wheat during the summer harvest. A certain unit stationed far away at the foot of the Kunlun Mountains also enthusiastically helped the masses with the summer harvest, harvesting 203 mu of wheat in five days. The troops sent boiling water to the wheat fields themselves, and those who were far from the garrison set up stoves in the wheat fields to boil water to quench their thirst. These deeds were widely praised by people of all ethnic groups.
    The troops also helped poor people settle down and start businesses. The cultural troupe of a certain army saved five silver dollars from the food expenses in Tukqi Village to marry a wife for a peasant. Farmers from about 20 li nearby came to congratulate him after hearing the news. Everyone said, "We poor people have never seen such a good army in our lives." This matter became a beautiful story among the people of all ethnic groups in southern Xinjiang. During the spring plowing, a certain division gave 24 horses and 8 camels to local poor peasants, and helped the masses dig ditches and organize mutual aid and labor exchange. Some troops built new walls and houses for local poor peasants.
    Such deeds are endless. The people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang have seen, heard, and personally felt the benefits brought by the troops' production, thus gradually changing their traditional views of the army in the past.
    During the spring plowing, the troops lacked knowledge of agriculture in Xinjiang. People of all ethnic groups automatically told the troops about the geology, climate, and sowing of crops in Xinjiang. When the Seventh Company of a certain regiment did not know how to sow seeds, the peasants told them: "Sow a handful every two steps." Masses in various places competed to vacate houses for the production troops to live in, and were happy to lend farm tools, livestock, and carts to help the troops transport grain; the troops also harvested wheat for the peasants in return. Some troops who were engaged in production received bandit suppression missions and left the immature wheat and set off. The local peasants automatically watered and harvested for them. When the troops came back, the wheat was piled high in the wheat field. The troops thanked the peasants, and the peasants said: "Heart for heart, we will never forget the benefits you have given us."
    The feelings between the military and civilians are harmonious. The Hui farmers in the garrison area of the Second Platoon of the Special Service Company of a certain regiment handed over their keys to the troops for safekeeping when they went out. The farmers in the garrison area of the Third Battalion of the regiment asked the comrades of the troops to explain current affairs. After the autumn harvest, a certain unit in Hotan wanted to return to the regimental headquarters for the winter, but the local masses did not allow them to leave. When the troops left, the masses sent many gifts of condolences and asked them to be sure to come back in the spring of next year. Abazi's mother cried two or three times in front of the house where the troops lived because she could not bear to part with the troops. Several people said cordially: "The People's Liberation Army has never done anything to offend us. Even children as young as three or four years old in the village regard the People's Liberation Army as their own fathers and brothers. They borrow things casually and return them promptly, and have never taken advantage of the common people. They are really good troops of Chairman Mao!"
    The troops' production has reduced the burden on the people. The public grain requisitioned in the autumn of 1950 was 300,000 shi less than the land tax grain during the rule of the Kuomintang bandit gangs. The troops also paid 20,000 shi of public grain on behalf of the people. The people of all ethnic groups praised this. An old farmer in the suburbs of Dihua said: "I have lived for fifty or sixty years and have never seen an army that also grows crops, harvests grain and pays public grain, so that the households have to pay less. Only Chairman Mao cares about the production of the households and tells them to plant more land and harvest more grain."
    The change in military-civilian relations in Xinjiang marks the transformation of ethnic relations. The Kuomintang bandit gangs used the army as a tool to oppress and exploit all ethnic groups. The devastation and oppression of the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang by these counter-revolutionary armed forces deepened the hatred and estrangement among all ethnic groups. Today, the people of Xinjiang feel in their own lives that the People's Liberation Army are their relatives and reliable protectors, so the relationship between all ethnic groups has reached unprecedented unity.
  III. A Great Beginning
    The love and support of the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang for the Chinese Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the Central People's Government also shows that all ethnic groups have begun to move towards great unity.
    The Islamic people are satisfied with the policy of freedom of religious belief. Kahn Xilaimu, a great Ahong in a rural village in Yutian County, said: "We have fifteen scripture schools in the county, each with 140 to 200 male and female students. People are completely free to believe in religion. In the past, some people said that the Communist Party would destroy religion, which is complete nonsense. Facts prove that this is a rumor fabricated by the enemy." They expressed great joy at the fact that there are no more bandits harassing them, no more exorbitant taxes, and the people can live a peaceful and free life, and said, "This is the happiness we have obtained under the leadership of Chairman Mao."
    An old farmer in his seventies, Xie Rihan, said: "During the rule of the Kuomintang bandit gangs, we ethnic minorities were oppressed, and the poor could not survive under the exploitation of exorbitant taxes. Now that the Communist Party has come, the lives of the poor have improved, and the People's Liberation Army does not take anything from the people. I am very happy. I have lived for seventy years and have finally been liberated." The hired worker Alie Ahong said: "Chairman Mao and the Communist Party are our fathers."
    People of all ethnic groups use various ways to express their love for Chairman Mao and the Communist Party. Poems praising Chairman Mao and the Communist Party are circulating among all ethnic groups; at every mass rally, they shout "Ya Xia Song (Long live), Mao Zedong!" and hold up huge portraits of Chairman Mao; when Chairman Mao appears on the screen in the cinema, there is always prolonged applause. In Hotan, in order to commemorate Chairman Mao, the people named a water canal they had dug themselves "Mao Zedong Canal."
    Precisely for this reason, when U.S. imperialism invaded our friendly neighbor Korea and our Taiwan, bombed our Northeast, and burned the flames of aggression to the border of our motherland, all ethnic groups unanimously launched a patriotic movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to protect their homes and defend the country. In Dihua City alone, 70,000 people participated in the demonstration parade celebrating the recovery of Pyongyang. Among the more than 1,000 people who signed up to join the Chinese People's Volunteers, there were outstanding youths from all ethnic groups. People of all ethnic groups wrote countless letters of condolence in their own languages and donated gifts of condolences to comfort the Chinese and Korean people's troops. In the anti-American patriotic movement, the people of all ethnic groups have further united.
    1950 was a year in which the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang began to move towards great unity, a year of great beginnings. The people of all ethnic groups are filled with a sense of pride in their own ethnicity and feel warm and honored to be a member of the friendly and cooperative big family of all ethnic groups in the People's Republic of China. This great fundamental transformation demonstrates the great victory of the Common Program's ethnic policy, which is the great victory of Mao Zedong's ethnic policy.

　　从军民关系的转变到民族关系的转变
　  ——记新疆各民族大团结的一年
    胡中
    新疆解放后，由于省人民政府执行了各民族一律平等的民族政策，特别是由于人民解放军一年来的剿匪和生产，安定了社会秩序，加强了军民团结，在各族人民间起了巨大的影响，使各民族间的关系，开始由过去的压迫、仇杀、猜忌和不信任等不正常现象逐步走向团结互助和友爱合作。这在新疆说来，是一个历史性的根本变化。
  一、新的团结友爱的时代
    国民党反动匪帮的军队，从来就是各民族人民的敌人。他们从来就是住到那里，吃到那里，害到那里。中国人民解放军进入新疆后，结束了国民党匪帮在新疆的反动统治和民族压迫，全疆各族人民对人民解放军都表示了热烈地欢迎和拥护。
    当人民解放军进驻迪化时，迪化人民用暴风雨般的掌声来向自己的解放者欢呼。哈萨克人民从百余里以外赶来欢迎；维吾尔族人民说：“维族今天和国内其他民族一同翻身了。”
    进驻和阗的人民解放军，在缺乏交通工具的困难情况下，为了更快地解放和阗人民，便横渡了一千五百六十余华里的塔里木大沙漠，其中有一千三百余里绝无人烟。部队以克服一切困难的惊人毅力，每天行军百里以上，完成了解放和阗的任务，创造了历史上少有的壮举；而和阗各族人民，则自动动员了三百多头毛驴，一百匹骆驼，一百匹马，在几十里以外迎接解放大军；四、五万人民更用锣鼓、民族舞蹈和夹道欢呼迎接了人民解放军入城。这在新疆历史上都是从来没有过的事情。
    其他各地各族人民都以空前未有的愉快心情，扎起彩牌坊、敲起锣鼓，并用各种不同的语言，向解放自己的人民解放军欢呼致意。
    进驻新疆的人民解放军是汉族劳动人民，是中国共产党领导的军队。各民族人民对解放军的热烈欢迎，流露着各族人民真挚的感情。从此，新疆各族人民进入了一个新的、充满团结、友爱和欢笑的时代。
  二、“人心换人心”
    新疆人民解放军一年来进行了艰苦的剿匪工作，基本上肃清了危害新疆各族人民而为新疆各族人民恨之入骨的美帝、蒋匪的间牒乌斯满匪徒，活捉了贾尼木汗、乌拉孜拜、司迪克等匪首，基本上安定了社会秩序。同时，他们在剿匪空隙，又进行了轰轰烈烈的生产运动。人民解放军一年来奋不顾身的劳动生产，使部队半年以上的食粮得以自给。因而减轻了人民的负担，节省了粮食的运费，改善了部队的生活，巩固了起义部队，尤其改变了社会上由于国民党匪帮长期统治所造成的轻视劳动的风气。而且，由于部队在生产中坚决执行了正确的民族政策，随时帮助各族人民犁地、浇水、收割以及建立家务等，这样便在政治上、经济上给各民族间进一步友爱团结打下了不可动摇的基础。
    部队在用水的问题上照顾了各族人民，具体规定了“远地先浇，近地后浇，人民先浇，军队后浇”的办法；而且取消了过去霸占水利的不合理现象，组织了水利委员会，解决了历年的水利纠纷。各地部队并进行了挖掘水渠的伟大工程，一年内所挖的水渠，可以灌溉一百二十七万余亩土地。引来的水，除供部队自己使用外，多余的水量就供给群众使用。某团炮兵连修好了十多年来荒废的二十里长的一条大渠和四条支渠，将两条支渠让给群众使用，使几千亩地得到了灌溉之利。昌吉某团帮助群众修了长四百余公尺的两条水渠。阿克苏西四十里栏杆的水渠决口了，往年需要月余时间才能修好，而在人民解放军的协助下，两天即完全修复，使稻田未因水渠决口而旱死。某军为了给群众足够的水量，便将准备种稻子的地改种了包谷。一九五○年解放军共开荒一百万亩（春耕八十五万亩，冬麦十余万亩），非但没有妨碍群众用水，而且还在用水上给了群众以相当帮助。各地人民在解放军兴修水利的影响下，也掀起了从来未有的挖掘水渠的劳动热潮。
    有些部队把自己开的荒地分给贫苦农民种，有些帮助农民浇地和收割。某团五连驻地有五家维族人民种了百余亩地，撒了种后，他们到骆驼驿去了。战士们眼看着他们的庄稼就要枯死，便自动地给他们浇了两天水。等他们回来后，看到地里的麦子长得绿油油的了，心中感激万分。某军直属队在夏收时帮助群众割了五百余亩地的麦子。远驻在昆仑山下的某部也热情地帮助群众夏收，五天内便割麦二百零三亩。部队自己往麦田里送开水，离驻地较远的便在麦地里架起锅灶自己烧水解渴。这些事迹，普遍得到各族人民的赞扬。
    部队还帮助穷苦人民安家立业。某军文工队在土克其村从伙食费中节省下五元银洋为一个农民娶了媳妇。附近二十里左右的农民闻讯都赶来给他贺喜，大家说：“我们穷人一辈子也没有见过这样好的军队。”在南疆各族人民中，这件事传为美谈。某师在春耕中送给当地贫苦农民二十四匹马，八匹骆驼，并且帮助群众挖渠，组织互助变工。有些部队给当地贫苦农民砌新墙，盖房子。
    这样的事迹是说不完的。新疆各族人民看到了、听到了、也亲身受到了部队生产所给予的利益，由此就逐渐改变了他们过去对军队的传统的看法。
    春耕中部队缺乏对新疆农业上的知识，各族人民便自动告诉部队新疆的地质、气候以及作物的撒种等知识。某团七连在撒种时不得要领，农民便告诉他们：“两步撒一把。”各地群众争着给生产的部队腾出房子住，乐意借出农具、牲口、大车帮部队拉运粮食；部队也给农民割麦子还工。有些地方正在进行生产的部队接到了剿匪任务，就抛下未成熟的麦子出发了。当地农民便自动给他们浇水、收割。部队回来，麦子已在麦场上堆得高高的。部队向农民道谢，农民说：“人心换人心，我们忘不了你们给我们的好处。”
    军民间的感情是融洽的。某团特务连二排驻地的回族农民，出门时将钥匙交给部队代管，该团三营驻地的农民，请部队的同志讲解时事。和阗某部秋收后要回团部过冬，当地群众不让离开。当部队离开时，群众送了许多慰劳品，并要求他们明年开春后一定回来。阿巴孜的母亲因为舍不得部队，在部队住过的房子前面哭了两三次。好几个人亲切地说：“解放军没有做过一件对不起咱们的事，村里连三四岁的小孩也把解放军当作自己父兄一样看待。平时借东西随借随还，没有沾过老百姓一点便宜，真是毛主席的好队伍啊！”
    部队的生产使各族人民的负担减轻了，一九五○年的秋征公粮，比国民党匪帮统治时的田赋粮减少了三十万石，部队还代缴了二万石公粮。各族人民对此赞不绝口。迪化近郊的老农民说：“我活了五六十岁，没见过军队也种庄稼，打下粮食还要缴公粮，让户家少出。只有毛主席才关顾户家的生产，叫多多种地，多打粮食。”
    军民关系的改变，在新疆就是标志着民族关系的转变。国民党匪帮是以军队来作为压迫和剥削各民族的工具的。这些反革命武装对新疆各族人民的摧残压迫，使各民族间的仇恨和隔阂日益加深。今天新疆人民在自己的生活中，感到了人民解放军是他们的亲人和可以信赖的保护者，因而各族间的关系也就达到了空前的团结。
  三、伟大的开端
    新疆各族人民对中国共产党、毛主席和中央人民政府的热爱和拥护，也说明着各族间已开始走向大团结。
    伊斯兰教人民对宗教信仰自由的政策是满意的。于阗县一个农村的卡恩喜来木大阿訇说：“我们全县有十五个经文学校，每校有男女学生一百四十至二百名不等，人民信仰宗教是完全自由的。过去有人说共产党灭教，完全是胡说，事实证明这是敌人捏造的谣言。”他们对于现在没有土匪骚扰，没有苛捐杂税，人民都能过着安宁、自由的生活表示万分庆幸，都说：“这是毛主席领导我们得到的幸福。”
    七十多岁的老农民谢日汉这样说：“国民党匪帮统治时代，我们少数民族是被压迫的，穷人更在苛捐杂税剥削下活不下去。现在共产党来了，穷人的光景好过了，解放军又不拿人民一丝一毫东西，我真高兴，我活了七十岁居然得到了解放。”雇工艾列阿洪说：“毛主席和共产党是我们的父亲。”
    各族人民用各种方式来表示他们对毛主席和共产党的热爱。在各民族中流传着歌颂毛主席和共产党的诗歌；在每一个群众集会上高呼“雅霞颂（万岁），毛泽东！”并高举毛主席的巨像；在电影院的银幕上出现毛主席时，总是响起历久不绝的掌声。在和阗，人民为了纪念毛主席，更把他们亲手挖成的一条水渠命名为“毛泽东渠”。
    正因为这个缘故，在美帝国主义侵略我友邻朝鲜和我国台湾，轰炸我东北，并把侵略火焰烧到我祖国边境的时候，各民族一致掀起了抗美援朝保家卫国的爱国运动。仅迪化市即有七万人民参加了庆祝平壤光复的示威大游行。在签名要求参加中国人民志愿军的一千多人中，包含了各民族的优秀青年。各族人民用自己的文字写成了无数封慰劳信，并捐献慰劳品，来慰问中朝人民部队。在反美爱国运动中，各族人民是进一步团结起来了。
    一九五○年是新疆各民族人民开始走向大团结的一年，是伟大开端的一年。各民族人民正充满着对自己民族的自豪感，并以自己是中华人民共和国各民族友爱合作大家庭内的一个成员而感到温暖和光荣。这个伟大的根本转变，说明了共同纲领民族政策的伟大胜利，也就是毛泽东民族政策的伟大胜利。
