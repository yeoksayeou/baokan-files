　　【This Newspaper's Report】The Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government recently issued a notice stating: Central government agencies launched a "one or two kilograms of rice savings for disaster relief" campaign in November 1949, originally scheduled to end at the end of February 1950. However, due to the difficult living conditions of disaster victims in the spring of 1950, and the continuous occurrence of various new disasters in many areas, after discussions from all parties, it was extended twice until September 1950. Although the campaign has ended, many agencies have continued to donate on their own initiative. Over the past year, the vast majority of agencies have shown great concern for the disaster-stricken people, greatly boosting the confidence of the people in disaster areas to overcome difficulties through production.
