　　U.S. Imperialism Is the Most Vicious Enemy of the Chinese People
    Izvestia Publishes Special Article by Berezny
    [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 6th] TASS Moscow dispatch: Izvestia on the 5th published a lengthy article by Berezny, entitled "U.S. Imperialists - The Most Vicious Enemy of the Chinese People." The article said: The ruling circles of the United States are pursuing a policy of aggression against the People's Republic of China in the Far East, but are trying to conceal the imperialist nature of their aggression with a torrent of lies and slanders. The U.S. imperialists who send planes to attack Chinese cities have donned the mask of "friends" of the Chinese people with unheard-of shamelessness. They distort the facts in an attempt to prove that the U.S. policy towards China has always been completely selfless.
    The representative of the People's Republic of China, Wu Xiuquan, gave a proper rebuttal to those historical fabricators in the United States. In his draft speech to the New York press on December 16, Wu Xiuquan convincingly demonstrated that U.S. imperialists have always been enemies of the Chinese people. A century and a half of relations between the United States and China is a series of uninterrupted atrocities, colonial plunder, and aggression. Economic expansion, bribery, blackmail, provocation, intimidation, as well as bombing of peaceful towns and open military intervention, are the means used by the U.S. ruling circles in their attempt to turn China into a fiefdom of U.S. monopolies. The United States has always supported the most mercenary reactionaries in China, who have been rejected by the Chinese people with anger and contempt.
    Berezny pointed out: At the beginning of the imperialist stage, the United States began to strive for exclusive domination over China. The U.S. "Open Door" policy was precisely for these purposes, but Dulles and Austin described this policy as the main proof of the U.S.'s friendly attitude towards the Chinese people. The article pointed out: The announcement of the Open Door policy did not make U.S. imperialism abandon the methods of military aggression. This was fully exposed in 1900, when U.S. troops, along with troops from other countries, bathed in the blood of anti-imperialist people's uprisings, forcing China to sign new enslaving treaties. Since then, U.S. armed forces have been stationed in certain areas of China.
    Berezny continued: When the 1925 revolution began in China, the United States, along with other imperialist countries, organized intervention. The United States supported the counter-revolutionary warlord armies and concentrated its own troops in China. U.S. warships loaded with Marines appeared by the dozens in Shanghai and other Chinese ports. The U.S. War Department drafted plans for extensive military intervention.
    During the same period that the United States was interfering in the Chinese revolution of 1925-1927, the reactionary alliance between the Chiang Kai-shek clique and the U.S. monopoly capitalists laid the foundation. Since then, Chiang Kai-shek, the mortal enemy of the Chinese people, has become a running dog of U.S. imperialism. A large number of agents of U.S. monopoly capitalists were all over China. Various committees planned U.S. "assistance" in the construction of China's railways, finances, and other aspects. As a result, the political influence of the United States in China greatly increased.
    The article also pointed out: From 1931, the year Japan invaded Northeast China, until the outbreak of the Pacific War, the United States consistently supplied the mortal enemy of the Chinese people, militarist Japan, with war materials. Tens of millions of Chinese people were killed by weapons made with these war materials. Even in the autumn of 1941, the United States continued to negotiate with Japan, attempting to sacrifice China in order to reach an agreement with Japan. Before the end of the Pacific War, the United States was already equipping and training Kuomintang troops, preparing for a civil war in China. Subsequent developments are known to everyone. In order to finally realize its old plan to enslave the Chinese people, the United States gave Chiang Kai-shek a large amount of money, weapons, and ammunition. However, the great and heroic Chinese people shattered the vicious plan to turn China into a U.S. colony. The founding of the People's Republic of China dealt a heavy blow to the entire imperialist system and all kinds of imperialist aggression plans. Unwilling to accept the failure of their aggressive policies, the U.S. imperialists are now carrying out open aggression against China. The Chinese people know that U.S. imperialists have always been their enemies, and no U.S. propaganda conspiracy can erase this from the memory of the Chinese people.
    Berezny wrote in conclusion that the liberated Chinese people, with the support of the world's democratic forces led by the Soviet Union, will certainly defeat all the plundering plans of the U.S. aggressors, and will certainly be able to sweep away all obstacles standing in the way of building an independent, prosperous, and strong China.

### 美帝是中国人民最凶恶的敌人  消息报发表倍列兹尼专文

　　美帝是中国人民最凶恶的敌人
    消息报发表倍列兹尼专文
    【新华社六日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：消息报五日发表倍列兹尼的长篇论文，题为“美帝国主义者——中国人民最凶恶的敌人”。论文说：美国的统治集团正在远东进行侵略中华人民共和国的政策，可是却力图以漫天的谎言与诽谤来掩饰它的帝国主义的侵略性质。派遣飞机去侵袭中国城市的美帝国主义者，却以闻所未闻的厚颜无耻穿上了中国人民的“友人”的外衣。他们歪曲事实，企图证明美国对中国的政策一直是毫不自私的。
    中华人民共和国代表伍修权对美国的那些历史伪造者，给予了确当的驳斥。伍修权在其十二月十六日致纽约报界的演说稿中，令人信服地说明了美帝国主义者一直是中国人民的仇敌。一个半世纪的美国与中国的关系史，乃是一系列不间断的暴行、殖民劫掠与侵略。经济扩张、贿买、讹诈、挑衅、恫吓以及轰炸和平城镇和公开的军事干涉，这些都是美国统治集团企图把中国变成美国垄断企业的采邑所使用的手段。美国始终在支持被中国人民愤怒和轻蔑地弃绝了的中国最唯利是图的反动分子。
    倍列兹尼指出：在帝国主义阶段开始的时候，美国便开始为独霸中国而努力。美国的“门户开放”政策正是为了这些目的，而杜勒斯与奥斯汀却把这个政策说成美国对中国人民的友好态度的主要证明。论文指出：门户开放政策的宣布，并没有使美帝国主义摒弃军事侵略的方法。这在一九○○年就充分暴露出来了，当时美国军队与其他各国军队一起浴着反帝人民起义的鲜血，迫使中国签订了新的奴役条约。从此之后，美国武装部队便一直驻扎在中国的某些地区。
    倍列兹尼继续写道：当一九二五年革命在中国开始时，美国与其他帝国主义国家一同组织了干涉。美国支持了反革命的军阀军队，而且把它自己的军队集中于中国。装载着海军陆战队的美国军舰，成打成打地出现于上海及其他中国港口。美国陆军部草拟了进行广泛军事干涉的计划。
    在美国干涉一九二五至一九二七年中国革命的同一个时期，蒋介石集团与美国垄断资本家之间的反动联盟奠定了基础。自那时起，中国人民的死敌蒋介石就变成了美国帝国主义的走狗。美国垄断资本家的大批代理人遍布中国。各种委员会筹划了美国“协助”建设中国的铁路、财政等方面的计划。于是，美国在中国的政治影响大大地增加了。
    论文又指出：从一九三一年日本侵略中国东北的那一年开始，一直到太平洋战争爆发，美国始终在以战争物资供给中国人民的死敌——军国主义的日本。千千万万的中国人被用这些战争物资所制造的武器杀死了。甚至在一九四一年秋天，美国还继续同日本谈判，企图牺牲中国而与日本达成协议。太平洋战争还没有结束以前，美国就在装备与训练国民党军队，着手准备中国的内战了。随后的发展是谁都晓得的。美国为力求最后实现其奴役中国人民的老计划，于是给予蒋介石以大批金钱、武器与弹药。然而，伟大的英勇的中国人民粉碎了想把中国变成美国的殖民地的恶毒计划。中华人民共和国的成立，严重打击了整个帝国主义体系以及帝国主义的种种侵略计划。不甘心于他们的侵略政策失败的美国帝国主义者们，现在正对中国进行公开的侵略。中国人民知道美帝国主义者一向是他们的敌人，这一点是任何美国的宣传阴谋都无法从中国人民的记忆中抹去的。
    倍列兹尼在结语中写道，解放了的中国人民在以苏联为首的全世界的民主力量的支持下，必将挫败美国侵略者的一切掠夺计划，而且必能把横在建设独立、富强、繁荣的中国的大道上的各种障碍扫除净尽。
