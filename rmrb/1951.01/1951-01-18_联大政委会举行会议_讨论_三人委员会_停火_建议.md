Xinhua News Agency, New York, January 13th: TASS, New York, January 13th—The United Nations General Assembly Political Committee held a meeting on January 11th. Its agenda still included the United States' slanderous case against China regarding the Korean issue. At the beginning of the meeting, Pearson (Canada), representing the so-called "Three-Person Committee," read a supplementary report. He believed that this report stipulated the "basic principles" for resolving the Korean issue.

The "Three-Person Committee's" report vaguely put forward some "principles," which, according to the drafters of the report, aimed to implement a plan for a ceasefire in Korea and the establishment of a unified Korea in "stages." The report still rejected the proposal for the immediate withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea, which could end the American aggression against Korea and China and open the way for a peaceful resolution of the Korean and other Far Eastern issues.

Therefore, the Political Committee only discussed the recommendations put forward in the "supplementary report."

The Norwegian representative spoke in support of the recommendations put forward by the "Three-Person Committee."

The French representative, Chauvel, made a grandstanding speech slandering the Chinese and Korean people.

The Indian representative, Rau, while speaking in support of the recommendations under discussion, said that his delegation believed that the Taiwan issue mentioned in the recommendations should only be resolved in accordance with the spirit of the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation.

The British representative, Jebb, fully supported the principles in the "supplementary report" and threatened that if the government of the People's Republic of China did not agree to accept the "principles" contained in the report, Britain would continue its aggression against Korea.

The American representative, Austin, also spoke in favor of the "Three-Person Committee's" report, and similarly threatened that if the "Three-Person Committee's" report was rejected, the United States would continue its aggression against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

The representative of the Syngman Rhee group then spoke. He greatly slandered the Korean people and the Chinese people, and praised the American aggression to the skies.

The representatives of Israel and Turkey fully supported the "Three-Person Committee's" recommendations. After their speeches, the Soviet representative, Malik, spoke.

After the Chilean representative made a brief speech expressing support for the "Three-Person Committee's" principles, the Polish representative, Katz-Suchy, criticized the report under discussion and emphasized that the measures recommended in the report did not contain anything new, as similar recommendations had already been discussed. He urged the Political Committee to pay attention to the fact that the purpose of the principles currently under discussion, just like all previous recommendations of the "Three-Person Committee," was to give MacArthur's troops time to continue the American aggression with new strength. Katz-Suchy also pointed out that the principles under discussion and the speeches of the representatives of the United States, Britain, and France all seemed like ultimatums. The Polish representative urged the Political Committee to stop the slander against the Chinese and Korean people, and said that the Korean issue could only be resolved in practice on the basis of the immediate withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea and giving the Korean people the possibility of solving Korea's problems themselves.

Xinhua News Agency, January 16th: New York News: The United Nations General Assembly Political Committee held meetings on January 12th and 13th to continue discussing the "supplementary report" on the "basic principles" for resolving the Korean issue, proposed by the Canadian representative Pearson on behalf of the so-called "Three-Person Committee" at the January 11th meeting. According to the report, its goal was to "complete in stages" a "plan for a ceasefire in Korea, the establishment of a free and unified Korea, and the pursuit of a peaceful resolution of Far Eastern issues." However, the report continued to reject the reasonable proposal to use the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea and the resolution of Korean internal affairs by the Korean people themselves as the basis for negotiations on a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, and still stipulated that a "ceasefire" should be "arranged" in Korea first. The report vaguely suggested that after the "ceasefire" was achieved, "all non-Korean troops will withdraw from Korea in appropriate stages, and appropriate measures will be established in accordance with United Nations principles to enable the Korean people to express their free will regarding their future government." The report also suggested: "Once an agreement on a ceasefire is reached, the General Assembly will establish an appropriate body, which will include representatives of the governments of the United Kingdom, the United States of America, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and the People's Republic of China, in order to seek a solution to Far Eastern issues in accordance with existing international obligations and the provisions of the United Nations Charter, including the issue of Formosa (Taiwan) and the representation of China in the United Nations."

At the January 12th meeting, the representatives of the Netherlands, Australia, Greece, and the Syngman Rhee group spoke in support of the "Three-Person Committee's" report.

The Israeli representative, Eban, proposed on the 12th that the Political Committee adopt the "basic principles" listed in the "Three-Person Committee's" report, and stipulated that "the Secretary-General of the United Nations be requested to transmit these principles to the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China." The British representative, Jebb, supported the Israeli proposal. The representatives of Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, and Chile opposed the Israeli proposal.

At the afternoon meeting on the 13th, the chairman of the Political Committee, U Thanit Abilas, ruled to shelve the Israeli proposal and first vote on the "Three-Person Committee's" report. In the voting, fifty votes were in favor, seven votes (Soviet Union, Ukraine, Byelorussia, Poland, Czechoslovakia, El Salvador, and Kuomintang) were against, and one vote (Philippines) abstained.

The Soviet representative, Malik, issued a statement saying that the Soviet delegation voted against it because the representatives of the Korean people and the People's Republic of China must be invited to participate in solving such problems. Because the representatives of North Korea were not invited and the People's Republic of China did not participate in the resolution of this issue, the Soviet delegation voted against accepting the recommendations put forward in the supplementary report of the "Three-Person Committee." The Polish representative, Katz-Suchy, also stated that the Polish delegation voted against it because the representatives of the People's Government of China and the People's Government of North Korea did not participate in the discussion.

Afterwards, the Israeli representative proposed that the Political Committee ask the Secretary-General of the United Nations to transmit the supplementary report of the "Three-Person Committee" passed by the Political Committee to the People's Government of China, and requested the People's Government of China to reply as soon as possible to express its attitude. The Norwegian representative then proposed to immediately transmit the above report to the People's Government of China. He believed that the People's Government of China should not be asked to inform the Political Committee of its opinions, but should be asked to state whether it recognizes the principles listed in the report as the basis for resolving Far Eastern issues.

After some discussion on procedural issues, the Indian representative, Rau, requested some time for consideration and proposed a recess. However, the Political Committee rejected his proposal and, on the proposal of the Australian representative, Shawn, put the Norwegian proposal to a vote. As a result of the vote, the Norwegian proposal was passed with forty-five votes in favor, five votes (Soviet Union, Ukraine, Byelorussia, Poland, and Czechoslovakia) against, and eight votes (Egypt, El Salvador, Luxembourg, etc.) abstaining.

　　联大政委会举行会议
    讨论“三人委员会”“停火”建议
    【新华社十三日讯】塔斯社纽约十三日讯：联合国大会政治委员会于一月十一日举行会议，它的议程上仍有美国就朝鲜问题提出的诽谤中国案。会议开始时，皮尔逊（加拿大）代表所谓“三人委员会”宣读补充报告。他认为，这个报告中规定了解决朝鲜问题的“基本原则”。
    “三人委员会”的报告含糊其词地提出了一些“原则”，据这个报告的起草人说，这些原则的目的是分“阶段”实施朝鲜停火和建立统一的朝鲜的方案。报告仍拒绝立即自朝鲜撤退一切外国军队的建议，这个建议是可以结束美国对朝鲜和中国的侵略，并为和平解决朝鲜及其他远东问题开辟道路的。
    因此，政委会只讨论了“补充报告”中所提出的建议。
    挪威代表发言支持“三人委员会”所提出的建议。
    法国代表萧维尔在他的演说中大放厥词，诽谤中国及朝鲜人民。
    印度代表劳氏在发言中支持正在讨论的建议时说，他的代表团认为，建议中所提到的台湾问题，只应按照开罗宣言和波茨坦公告的精神来解决。
    英国代表杰伯完全支持“补充报告”中的原则，并威吓说，如果中华人民共和国政府不同意接受报告中所包含的“原则”，英国就将继续进行对朝鲜的侵略。
    美国代表奥斯汀也发言赞成“三人委员会”的报告，并同样地威吓说：如果“三人委员会”的报告被拒绝，美国将继续对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国进行侵略。
    李承晚集团的代表继起发言。他对朝鲜人民与中国人民大肆诽谤，把美国侵略捧到天上。
    以色列与土耳其两国代表完全支持“三人委员会”的建议。在他们发言后，苏联代表马立克接着发言。
    在智利代表作简短发言表示赞成“三人委员会”的原则以后，波兰代表卡茨——苏琪即批评所讨论的报告并强调指出：报告中所建议的措施没有包含任何新的东西，因为类似的建议早已经讨论过。他促请政委会注意一个事实：目前在讨论中的原则，其目的正像“三人委员会”以前所有的建议一样，在于给麦克阿瑟的部队的时间以便用新的力量来继续进行美国的侵略行动。卡茨——苏琪并指出：在讨论中的原则以及美国、英国与法国的代表的发言都好象是最后通牒，波兰代表敦促政委会制止诽谤中国人民与朝鲜人民的行为，并且说：实际上只有在一切外国军队立即撤出朝鲜，并给朝鲜人民以自己解决朝鲜的可能性的基础上，朝鲜问题才能获得解决。
    【新华社十六日讯】纽约消息：联合国大会政治委员会于一月十二、十三日举行会议，继续讨论加拿大代表皮尔逊在十一日会议上代表所谓“三人委员会”提出的关于解决朝鲜问题的“基本原则”的“补充报告”。据报告说：其目标在“分阶段地完成”“朝鲜停火、建立自由统一的朝鲜、以及谋取远东问题的和平解决的方案”。但是报告继续拒绝以一切外国军队撤出朝鲜及朝鲜内政由朝鲜人民自己解决，为和平调处朝鲜问题的谈判基础的合理建议，而仍然规定首先在朝鲜“安排停火”。报告含糊其词地建议，在“停火”实现后，“所有非朝鲜的军队将分适宜的阶段撤出朝鲜，并且将依照联合国原则订立适当措置使朝鲜人民对他们未来的政府表达他们的自由意志”。报告又建议：“一俟获致关于停火的协议，大会将设立一个适当机构，其中将包括联合王国、美利坚合众国、苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟、中华人民共和国四国政府代表，以便依照现有的国际义务与联合国宪章的规定来求得远东问题的解决，其中包括福摩萨（台湾）问题和中国在联合国中的代表权问题。”
    在十二日会议上，荷兰、澳大利亚、希腊及李承晚集团代表，发言支持“三人委员会”的报告。
    以色列代表依班在十二日提出提案建议政委会通过“三人委员会”报告中所列举的“基本原则”，并规定“请联合国秘书长把这些原则转达中华人民共和国中央人民政府”。英国代表杰伯支持以色列提案。黎巴嫩、沙特阿拉伯及智利代表反对以色列提案。
    在十三日下午会议上，政委会主席乌但尼塔·阿彼拉兹裁决搁置以色列提案，而先行表决“三人委员会”的报告。表决时，五十票赞成，七票（苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、萨尔瓦多及国民党）反对，一票（菲律宾）弃权。
    苏联代表马立克发表声明说：苏联代表团投票反对，是因为解决这样的问题必须邀请朝鲜人民代表和中华人民共和国代表参加。而由于北朝鲜代表未被邀请，中华人民共和国亦未参加这个问题的解决，苏联代表团投票反对接受“三人委员会”的补充报告内所提出的建议。波兰代表卡茨—苏琪也声明说：波兰代表团投反对票，是因为中国人民政府和北朝鲜人民政府的代表都未参与讨论。
    其后以色列代表提议政委会由联合国秘书长将政委会通过的“三人委员会”的补充报告转达中国人民政府，并要求中国人民政府尽速答复，表示其态度。挪威代表继之提议立即将上项报告转达中国人民政府。他认为，不要要求中国人民政府将它的意见告诉政委会，而应该要求中国人民政府说明是否承认以报告中所列举的原则作为解决远东问题的基础。
    在程序问题上进行了一些讨论之后，印度代表劳氏要求有一些考虑的时间，提议休会。然而政委会否决了他的提议，并在澳大利亚代表尚恩的提议下，把挪威提案付表决。表决结果，挪威提案以四十五票赞成，五票（苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰和捷克斯洛伐克）反对，八票（埃及、萨尔瓦多、卢森堡等）弃权而通过。
