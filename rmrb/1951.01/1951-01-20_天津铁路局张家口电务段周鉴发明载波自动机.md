　　Zhou Jian of the Zhangjiakou Electrical Section of the Tianjin Railway Bureau
    Invents Carrier Automatic Machine
    Zhou Jian, a technician at the Zhangjiakou Electrical Section of the Tianjin Railway Bureau, demonstrated the high creativity of the working class in the patriotic production competition and invented the carrier automatic machine. Using this component, when making long-distance calls between locations A and B, it is not necessary to go through the exchanges in both locations. You can directly dial the desired phone number by turning the telephone dial. This invention is a great contribution to the railway and the national telecommunications industries. It not only saves manpower and transfer time but also increases the number of circuits. According to the current transfer time of 1.5 minutes per call, the circuit can handle 60 more calls per day, saving approximately 900,000 yuan. The annual savings are estimated at 324 million yuan. If this invention is promoted nationwide, it will save the country a huge amount of wealth. The Tianjin Railway Bureau has awarded Comrade Zhou Jian 500 salary points and a two-grade salary increase. The director personally wrote a letter congratulating him on his glorious achievement.

　　天津铁路局张家口电务段周鉴
    发明载波自动机
    天津铁路局张家口电务段试验员周鉴，在爱国主义生产竞赛中，发挥工人阶级的高度创造性，发明载波自动机。利用这个机件，甲乙两地挂长途电话时可以不经过两地交换所转挂，直接按你所要讲话的电话号码拨动电话机转盘便行，这一发明无论对铁路或全国电讯事业上来说，都有很大的贡献。不但节省了人力和接转时间，而且增加了回线次数。按照目前接转时间每次一·五分钟计算，回线每天可多接六十次。约可节省九十万元。全年计算可节省三亿二千四百万元。如果这一发明被推广到全国范围，将给国家节省一笔巨大的财富。现天津铁路局为此特奖给周鉴同志五百薪分，加薪两级。局长并亲自写信祝贺他的光荣成就。
