　　Henan Province In-Service Cadre Learning Experience
    Learning Overview
    In the past year, in-service cadres have studied political theories, including On the People's Democratic Dictatorship, the Common Program, Who Does Honor Belong To, Political Economy, Social Development History, the Party's Important Decision on Carrying Out Criticism and Self-Criticism, Striving for a Fundamental Turn for the Better in the Nation's Financial and Economic Situation, and current affairs after the outbreak of the Korean War. Cultural schools have been established in directly affiliated organizations of the Provincial Party Committee, directly affiliated organizations of the Prefectural and Municipal Party Committees, and some directly affiliated organizations of the County Party Committees, adhering to cultural learning for in-service cadres. In addition, various departments have organized professional studies. District-level cadres combined their work on anti-hegemony rent reduction and land reform with policy learning.
    From March to June of last year, there was a surge in theoretical learning, with social development history and political economy being studied universally from the province down to the counties. Some have completed the former, and some are about to complete it; some have studied eight chapters of the latter, and some have completed three chapters. After June, the weight of current affairs policies and rectification learning increased, and there was not enough time to allocate, the contradictions could not be resolved, which affected the theoretical study, some simply stopped, some fell into self-study, and some, although adhering to it, were in a relaxed state. In the midst of rectification, theoretical study was virtually halted. With the end of rectification in October, theoretical study was gradually resumed.
    Among cadres in organs above the county level, there is a widespread understanding of the importance of learning, a willingness to learn, and a demand for learning. A learning atmosphere and the habit of two hours of study in the morning have begun to develop, and the enthusiasm for learning is high, laying a favorable foundation for future learning. As for district cadres' learning, only a portion of them have paid attention to it, and many are not interested in learning. The learning in directly affiliated organizations of the province, cities, and prefectures is relatively standardized and regular. Formalism in learning at the county level is still quite serious, starting late and progressing slowly.
    In learning, studying the Common Program, Who Does Honor Belong To, Striving for a Fundamental Turn for the Better in the Nation's Financial and Economic Situation, and Social Development History, etc., have been more effective. There was a preliminary understanding of the Common Program, and individual ideas of personal fame and status were partially overcome. It was clarified that labor creates the world, a correct concept of labor was established, and the relationship between the Party and non-Party people was strengthened. The study of political economy has not been very effective.
    Several Issues
    1. Leading cadres attaching importance to learning, regarding leading learning as an indispensable part of the entire leadership work, and taking the lead by personally participating in the learning movement, using their own practical actions and experiences to promote and guide learning, is the central key to doing a good job in in-service cadre learning. For example, the propaganda ministers of the Xinyang, Huangchuan, Huaiyang, and Zhengzhou municipal party committees did this; therefore, the cadre learning there was done better.
    2. The organizational leadership of the Learning Committee. The Learning Committees above the county level and a few of the district Learning Committees have all been established in form; however, very few have become the core of leading learning, and most cannot even hold meetings. The reason for this is:
    (1) Most of the members of the Learning Committee are leading party and government comrades, who are busy with work and have heavy tasks, and do not have time to attend meetings.
    (2) Ideologically, leading comrades still have the problem of underestimating the leadership of learning. To solve this problem, we must start from two aspects: First, in-service cadre learning should be put on the work agenda of the Party Committee, discussed regularly, decisions made, and implemented, and the entire Party Committee should attach importance to it, with the Propaganda Department taking specific responsibility. Second, the organization of the Learning Committee should not absorb the participation of the entire Party Committee, but should be headed by the Propaganda Minister (or a Standing Committee member), and absorb the responsible comrades of the relevant departments to form the General Committee of Learning, with an office and two or three secretaries, and the general and branch committees directly under the provincial and municipal governments should also have a full-time secretary, who should work regularly to inspect learning, collect materials, study problems, introduce experiences, handle specific problems in daily learning, and put forward learning suggestions for the Learning Committee to study and decide. In this way, the Learning Committee will be sound and become a strong leading body.
    Learning branches should be set up according to the Party's organization (branch or general branch) and administrative units, and absorb the responsible comrades of the branch and administration as members. One of the main tasks of the organ branch is to lead cadres' learning through the Learning Committee.
    3. Grouping issues. Some places regard grouping as a "political treatment" and group according to "positions." For example, some old cadres of worker-peasant origin with low cultural levels should mainly focus on learning culture, but they are forced to participate in groups A, B, and C; they cannot understand the theory and are unwilling to be downgraded. Secondly, some intellectual new cadres like to learn thick books of Marxism-Leninism and are unwilling to learn thin books of Chinese revolution theory. The learning gains of these comrades are not great. There are two reasons for this: First, the individuals are not modest in learning, cannot put down their airs, and feel that they are old cadres with many years of experience and have leadership responsibilities. If they study like subordinates or new cadres, they will lose face. Intellectuals are dominated by ideas such as aiming too high. Second, the learning group and the Learning Committee are liberal and embarrassed to strictly evaluate and approve, but pass and approve perfunctorily. In the future, this problem must be thoroughly resolved ideologically, and the leadership must conduct in-depth and repeated mobilization to open up their minds. Secondly, the learning group and the Learning Committee should evaluate and approve with a serious attitude, and group correctly according to the two conditions of political and cultural level. As for some leading comrades with low cultural levels, they can also be grouped separately or set a personal learning plan, and designated someone to help them.
    4. Learning methods: Comrades with self-study ability mainly use the method of self-study, combined with writing reading notes and experiences, and purposefully communicating and discussing. Now everyone does not have the habit of reading. The combination of collective supervision and encouragement of self-study can prevent self-study. For comrades with low self-study ability, teaching and explanation should be the main method, combined with self-study and discussion, to answer difficult questions. In the case of self-study as the main method, specific help and guidance are very important. Therefore, we believe that it is necessary to establish a learning instructor system, and we should try to cultivate such talents in the future.
    5. Learning content: Groups A and B study political economy, and Group C studies social development history. Generally, everyone feels that they cannot understand it and cannot get into it. The reason is that the learning content is not commensurate with the theoretical level of the cadres and is not closely related to the work. Everyone believes that it is better to learn theories that are closely related to the work and are easy to understand. They are easy to understand, easy to connect with reality, can guide the work, are interesting, and the more they learn, the higher their enthusiasm, from near to far, from shallow to deep, from China to foreign countries. According to this situation, we have changed the learning content in the future. Group A studies socialist economic construction, or political economy. The former has a great guiding role for the problems of China's revolution and construction. Group B takes the "Chinese Revolution Reader" as an outline and studies Chairman Mao's four great works and the Common Program. Group C studies the Chinese Revolution Reader.
    The problem of learning current affairs policies. There are too many current affairs policies today, and it is impossible to learn them all. The past lesson is that one has not finished learning one, and then they are asked to learn the second and third, which are piled together, and as a result, nothing is learned well. In the future, we should conduct learning separately. Everyone generally feels that the learning time is not enough. This problem has not been solved for a long time. The directly affiliated organizations of the province are currently doing this: two hours in the morning to study theory, generally not stopping the theoretical study. Current affairs policies are placed in the evening to study (such as the Provincial Party Committee organs), or two or three afternoons are taken out each week to study, and business is combined with work study during office hours. In short, the problem of learning time should be solved, and the approval of the Party Committee and the administrative heads should be obtained for implementation, otherwise it will be squeezed out in actual work.

### 河南省在职干部学习经验

　　河南省在职干部学习经验
    学习概况
    一年来在职干部学习，曾进行过论人民民主专政、共同纲领、荣誉是属于谁的、政治经济学、社会发展史、党关于开展批评与自我批评的重要决定，为争取国家财政经济状况的基本好转而斗争及朝鲜战争爆发后的时事等政治理论学习。省委直属机关和地委市委直属机关及部分县委直属机关，均建立了文化学校，坚持了在职干部文化学习。此外，各部门还组织了业务学习。区级干部则结合反霸减租和土改等工作学习了政策。
    去年三月到六月份，是理论学习热潮，从省直到各县普遍进行着社会发展史和政治经济学的学习。前者有的已经学完，有的将要学完；后者有的学了八章，有的学完了三章。六月份以后，时事政策和整风学习的分量加重了，时间不敷支配，矛盾无法解决，影响了理论学习，有的干脆停止了，有的陷于自流，有的虽然坚持着，亦处于松懈状态。在整风中间，实际上都停止了理论学习。十月随着整风结束，又相继恢复着理论学习。
    在县以上机关干部中，普遍的认识到学习的重要，愿意学习，要求学习，开始有了学习风气和早晨两小时学习习惯，学习情绪很高，给今后开展学习打下有利基础。至于区干部学习，仅有一部分是注意了，尚有许多人对学习不感兴趣。省、市、地直属机关的学习比较正规、经常。县里学习形式主义还相当严重，开始既晚，进度亦慢。
    在学习中，以共同纲领、荣誉是属于谁的、为争取国家财政经济状况的基本好转而斗争、社会发展史等学习，收效较大。对共同纲领有了初步认识，个人名誉、地位思想，部分得到克服，明确劳动创造世界，树立了正确的劳动观念，密切了党与非党人士的联系。政治经济学学习收效不大。
    几个问题
    １、领导干部重视学习，将领导学习作为整个领导工作的一个不可缺少部分，并以身作则，亲自参加到学习运动中，用自己的实际行动和体验，推动和指导学习，是搞好在职干部学习的中心关键。如信阳、潢川、淮阳、郑市等地市委宣传部长，就是这样作的；所以，那里的干部学习搞的较好。
    ２、学委会的组织领导问题。县以上的学委会及少数的区学委会，从形式上看是都成立了；但成为领导学习的核心作用的却很少，多数连会议都开不成。究其原因：
    （一）学委会的委员多是党政负责同志，工作忙，任务重，没有时间参加会。
    （二）在领导同志思想上，还存在着轻视学习领导的问题。要解决这个问题，须从两方面着手：一、是在职干部学习应该提到党委的工作日程上来，定期讨论，做出决定，贯彻实行，全体党委重视起来，宣传部具体负责。二、学委会组织，不要吸收全体党委参加，以宣传部长（或一个常委）为主，吸收各有关部门负责同志参加组成学委总会，下设办公室和秘书二、三人，省直总、分会和地市直属总会并设专任秘书一人，定期办公，负责检查学习，收集材料，研究问题，介绍经验，处理日常学习中的具体问题，提出学习意见，供学委会研究、决定。这样，学委会才会健全起来，成为一个有力的领导机构。
    学习分会，按照党的组织（支部或总支）和行政单位设立之，吸收支部及行政负责同志为委员。机关支部主要任务之一，就是通过学委会领导干部学习。
    ３、编组问题。有些地方把编组视为“政治待遇”按“职位”进行编组，如有些工农出身文化水平又低的老干部，本应以学习文化为主，而硬要参加甲乙丙组；理论啃不懂，也不愿降组。其次是有些知识分子新干部，喜学马列主义厚本书，不愿学中国革命理论薄本书，这些同志的学习收获均不大。原因有二：一、是本人在学习上不虚心，放不下架子，觉得自己是个多年老干部，负有领导责任，若同下级或新干部一样学习，有失体面。知识分子是好高鹜远等思想作怪。二、是学习小组和学委会的自由主义，不好意思严格的评议和批准，而是马马虎虎地通过和批准了。今后这个问题，必须从思想上彻底解决，由领导上深入反复动员，打通思想。其次学习小组和学委会要以严肃态度评议和批准，按照政治文化水平两个条件，正确编组。至于有些文化低的领导同志，还可以单独编组或个人定学习计划，指定专人帮助。
    ４、学习方法：有自修能力的同志，主要是采用自学的方法，结合写读书笔记和心得，有目的地交谈讨论。现在大家都无读书的习惯，集体监督和鼓励自学结合起来可以防止自流，对自修能力低的同志，应以上课讲解为主，结合自学讨论，解答疑难问题。在自学为主的情况下，具体帮助指导是很重要的。因此我们认为是有必要设立学习指导员的办法，今后应设法专门培养这样的人材。
    ５、学习内容：甲乙组学习政治经济学，丙组学习社会发展史，普通感到啃不动，钻不进。原因是学习内容与干部理论水平不相称，同工作结合不紧。大家认为，这样倒不如学习与工作联系密切的和浅显易懂的理论为好，容易懂，好联系实际，可以指导工作，有兴趣，越学情绪越高，由近及远，由浅入深，由中国到外国。根据这个情况，我们改变了今后学习内容，甲组学社会主义经济建设，或政治经济学。前者对中国革命建设问题，指导作用很大。乙组以《中国革命读本》为提纲，学习毛主席的四大著作和共同纲领。丙组学习中国革命读本。
    时事政策的学习问题，今天的时事政策太多了，每个都学是学不完的，过去教训是一个没学完，又叫学第二个，第三个，压在一起，结果什么也学不好。今后应该有分别地进行学习。学习时间一般均感不够。这个问题很长时间也没有解决。省直属机关目前是这样作：早晨两小时学习理论，一般情况下不停止理论学习，时事政策放在晚上学习（如省委机关），或者是每周拿出两三个下午学习，业务放在办公时间内结合工作学习。总之学习时间问题，应努力解决，并征得党委和行政首长批准，以便执行，否则在实际工作中会被挤掉。
