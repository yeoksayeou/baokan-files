Xinhua News Agency, January 1st—The General Political Department of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission of the Central People's Government issued a New Year's letter to all honored servicemen and wounded soldiers of the People's Liberation Army on New Year's Day, 1951. The original letter is as follows:

Comrades Honored Servicemen and Wounded Soldiers:

    As the second New Year of New China—New Year's Day, 1951—approaches, we extend to you our cordial greetings and highest respect!

    In the struggles of 1950, including combat, bandit suppression, production, and mobilizing the masses, all commanders and fighters of our People's Liberation Army highly promoted the spirit of revolutionary heroism and achieved new and brilliant victories on the military and production fronts. These victories are inseparable from your heroic fighting and active work. The people of the whole country and the People's Government deeply respect and care for your disabilities, wounds, and accumulated fatigue. Your merits and glory will be forever remembered. In 1951, we will surely achieve greater victories in defending the motherland, resisting aggression, liberating Tibet and Taiwan, and eliminating the remaining bandits. We will also make new and significant achievements in building a strong national defense force. We wish all our honored servicemen comrades to actively participate in production and learning, participate in local work, and always maintain their honor; we wish all our wounded and sick comrades to recuperate peacefully, abide by hospital regulations, so as to restore their health as soon as possible, return to the battle and work posts, and strive for new victories and new glory!

    With best regards,

                          General Political Department of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission of the Central People's Government
                              January 1, 1951
