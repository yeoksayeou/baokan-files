　　"We Have Progressed!"
　　Comrade Editor:
　　Since September 1949, when we broke away from the Kuomintang reactionary government and were reorganized into the People's Liberation Army, more than a year has passed. Through the education of the Chinese Communist Party, we have recognized the crimes of the Kuomintang reactionary rule and recognized the truth. Now we have progressed! We have shed the "shell" of the old army.
　　This time, the higher authorities gave our regiment the glorious task of suppressing bandits. Our battalion was assigned the task of independently suppressing bandits in a mountainous area one hundred thirty to one hundred forty li away from the regimental headquarters. We overcame difficulties and successfully reached the bandit suppression area after five days of marching through desolate wilderness.
　　When the local people learned that we had arrived, they were very afraid. The people said, "They used to live here (referring to before the uprising), and they were very fierce: beating people, taking things, being unreasonable and domineering." At the same time, they also thought that we could not suppress the bandits.
　　In response to these situations, the higher authorities mobilized us and put forward the matters that should be paid attention to. We also made a hundredfold effort to change the bad impression the people had of us. In the nearly two months we have been here, we have annihilated two gangs of bandits and captured more than ten bandit ringleaders. We learned the glorious tradition of the People's Liberation Army: returning borrowed items, compensating for damaged items, and strictly observing local customs. Zhang, an old Hui man from Sanxiang (a place severely harmed by bandits), gratefully said to us: "In the past, we were so disturbed by the bandits that we didn't even dare to live in our own houses. Now that you have come, we feel at ease. Don't leave, quickly catch all the bandits." Under the leadership of the higher authorities, we changed the people's bad impression of us and won the support of the masses. The people all said, "You have changed." But we are not proud. We will use greater strength to protect the interests of the people, and we will always be the people's protectors.

### “我们进步了！”

　　“我们进步了！”编辑同志：
    我们自一九四九年九月间，脱离了国民党反动政府，改编为人民解放军，到现在已经一年多了。我们经过了中国共产党的教育，认识了国民党反动统治的罪恶，认识了真理。现在我们进步了！脱了旧军队的“壳”。
    这次，上级给了我团光荣的剿匪任务，我们营担任了离团部一百三四十里的一个山区单独执行剿匪的任务。我们经过了五天荒凉野地的行军，战胜了困难，顺利地到达了剿匪地区。
    当地老百姓知道我们来了，都很害怕，老百姓都说：“他们过去（指起义前）在我们这里住过，凶得很：打人，拿东西，蛮横不讲理。”同时他们又认为我们不能剿土匪。
    上级针对着这些情况，给我们进行了动员并提出了应注意的事项。我们也以百倍的努力，来改变老百姓对我们的坏印象。我们到此地近两个月的时间，歼灭了两股土匪，并捉了股匪头子十余名。我们学到了人民解放军的光荣传统：借物送还，损物赔偿，并严格地遵守了当地的风俗习惯。三乡（受土匪的害很严重的地方）的回民张老汉感激地对我们说：“过去我们被土匪闹得连自己的房子也不敢住，你们来了，我们就安心了。你们可不要走，快把土匪捉完。”在上级的领导下，我们改变了老百姓对我们的坏印象，得到了群众的拥护。老百姓们都说：“你们变了。”但我们没有骄傲，我们要用更大的力量来保卫人民的利益，我们将永远作为人民的保卫者。
