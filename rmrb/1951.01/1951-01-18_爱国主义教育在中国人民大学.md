　　Patriotic Education at Renmin University of China
　　Bai Sheng
　　(I) Characteristics of a New Type of University
　　Renmin University of China is the first new type of formal university in New China, and it has significant characteristics: First, its education is completely suitable for the needs of national construction and the purpose of serving the broad masses of the people. Therefore, its teaching policy is the combination of theory and practice. The spirit of loving the motherland and loving the people is implemented in all teaching content. The entire education plan is based on the actual needs of New China and the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and is carried out with the direct assistance of dozens of Soviet education experts. Another characteristic of this school is that its student composition is mainly revolutionary cadres and industrial workers, and the rest are young intellectuals. The students from worker and peasant backgrounds generally have very good political qualities, rich practical struggle experience, work experience, and production experience, as well as a high degree of enthusiasm for learning. However, their general cultural level is relatively low.
　　According to the actual needs of New China and the advanced experience of Soviet higher education, Renmin University has established eight departments, eleven specialized training classes, and one worker-peasant cultural supplementary class. In order to effectively carry out teaching and scientific research work, 41 teaching and research offices have been established. At the same time, in order to improve the political and theoretical level of all Party and non-Party cadres in the school, a formal Marxist-Leninist night university and night school have also been established.
　　(II) Patriotic Education Implemented in Regular Courses
　　In this university, patriotic education is implemented in all regular courses. The school uses the basic theoretical knowledge of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to arm the students' minds, which is the soul of all courses. The main courses common to all departments include Marxism-Leninism, Political Economy, History of the Chinese Revolution, Principles of People's Democracy, etc. These are the theoretical foundation for patriotic ideological education. Through the study of political economy, students understand the laws of economic development in capitalist society, understand the essence of imperialism, and understand the various contradictions and their development that promote its collapse, which strengthens their feelings of hatred, contempt, and disdain for the United States. Through the study of the history of the Chinese revolution, students understand the arduous struggle and experience of the Chinese New Democratic Revolution, and know how to fight for the consolidation and development of the victory of the people's revolution. At the same time, all courses run through the ideological education of patriotism. For example, the Chinese language course explains "What is heroic behavior," "Pavlov's letter to young people," Gong Chaqier's short story "Never Fall Behind," Comrade Hu Qiaomu's "Achievements We Have Already Achieved and Have Not Yet Achieved," and articles on respecting the national language and writing. After reading "Never Fall Behind," Wang Xuefa, a student in the worker-peasant cultural supplementary class, was immediately able to examine his own thoughts in connection with it. He said: "This article 'Never Fall Behind' is completely written to address my shortcomings. ... In the future, I must learn and work patiently with a spirit of responsibility to the motherland, and be a soldier who never falls behind." For example, in the Russian textbook, Soviet experts compiled stories of famous Chinese labor heroes Li Fenglian and Li Yong, the story of Soviet hero Matrosov, Stalin's discussion of the Chinese revolution, National Day, great victory, etc. as materials. The geography class also increased students' love for the great motherland. Some students used to think that the Northwest was a desert area, and the Kangzang area of the Southwest was a poor mountainous area that could not be transformed, but after studying geography for a few months, they began to realize that these places are rich in mineral resources and can be transformed into good bases for developing industry. Some students thought that learning geography only involved learning about mountains, rivers, products, etc., and was not of much significance. Now they know that learning geography is for transforming nature and building the motherland. After the launch of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, the Academic Affairs Department specially instructed teachers to combine the specific practical materials in the current situation in their lectures, and the school committee made a formal resolution for this purpose.
　　(III) High Enthusiasm for Learning
　　For the students, learning itself is a specific task required by the people's motherland to be completed, and it is a practical action of patriotism. The students said: "Learning is fighting," "Fighting to learn" - this is a common action slogan.
　　The students are making rapid progress in their studies. Especially the workers and revolutionary cadres who account for 72 percent of the students. They have worked hard to overcome the difficulties of their low level of education when they first arrived and have achieved very good results. Some students said: "It is more difficult to wield a pen than to wield a gun." As far as the worker-peasant cultural supplementary class is concerned, many students could not write articles at first, and did not even understand punctuation, but now it is very different. Jin Dinglin, who came from a worker's background, could only write three or four hundred words of incoherent articles when he first entered the class, but now he can write three thousand words of content. For example, writing diaries, at first everyone was not very enthusiastic, thinking that there was nothing to write, but after learning, everyone can write about their own experiences and feelings in the diary with emphasis. For example, Li Rongchun, a student in the Department of Diplomacy, was a young Red Army soldier during the Long March, and is now the chairman of the school's student union and was selected as a representative to attend the Second World Student Congress, thus delaying his studies for two months. He not only worked hard to catch up with the dropped courses, but also had the best exam scores. Jin Xiuling and Ruan Yi, students of the Department of Industrial Management, used to be female workers in the Beijing Clothing Factory and had only attended junior high school. They found it very difficult to study when they first entered the school, but they studied hard and achieved good exam results. Ruan Yi's usual grades are: Russian, Chemistry, Mathematics, and Drawing are all "Excellent," and Physics is "Good." According to the results of the usual grade check in November last year, 92.73 percent of the undergraduate students passed all courses, and five classes of specialized training students had a passing rate of over 80 percent, and six classes had a passing rate of over 90 percent.
　　(IV) Extracurricular Activities and Daily Life
　　In addition to regular course learning, the school's extracurricular activities and daily life are also full of the spirit of patriotic education. The extracurricular activities in the school are mainly carried out under the leadership of the school's Communist Party organization, and promoted by organizations such as the Communist Youth League, the Student Union, and the Trade Union. Extracurricular activities supplement and expand the knowledge gained in regular courses and broaden horizons. Allow students to have more contact with actual life, care about current political events, and strengthen patriotic sentiments.
　　Students often conduct current affairs and policy studies and read newspapers and periodicals. Each study group is assigned a copy of the People's Daily, and students learn about major domestic and foreign events from here every day, and concretely recognize the greatness of their motherland and the brightness of the world's anti-aggression camp. When the Model Heroes Conference was held in Beijing, the newspaper was like a "Roll of Honor," and the students were particularly excited those days to read about the revolutionary heroic deeds of the outstanding sons and daughters of New China.
　　There are many forms of extracurricular activities: there are frequent reports, lectures, and youth lectures and current affairs lectures are held. Experts are invited to give special reports on domestic and foreign current affairs and student movements. A weekly movie night is held, and films such as "The Fall of Berlin," "Liberated China," "Steel Will," and "Daughter of the Motherland" have been shown, which greatly encouraged the students' revolutionary enthusiasm. At the same time, everyone is organized to watch good plays from time to time, such as "How the Steel Was Tempered," etc. Visits and exhibitions have also given everyone a lot of education. They collectively visited the Changxindian factory area to see the new record-creating movement, visited farmers in the rural suburbs of Beijing, and also organized a trip to Qinhuangdao to appreciate the beautiful scenery of the motherland. These activities are mainly carried out during the holidays.
　　(V) Patriotic Education in the Two Movements
　　In the upsurge of the Resist America, Aid Korea, Defend the Homeland and Participate in Military Cadre Schools movements, Renmin University fully demonstrated the spirit of patriotism. Nearly three thousand students and many working cadres were very angry and excited and demanded to take practical actions to resist America, aid Korea, and defend their homeland. Application forms, volunteer forms, and letters of determination came like snowflakes. The entire school quickly launched a consolation and donation movement.
　　At the same time, students held many discussion meetings, connecting personal thoughts and discussing the current situation. Cheng Kexiong, a student in the Russian Department, said: "My previous understanding of the motherland was relatively empty. After political study and the education of practical movements, I began to realize: What is the motherland? The motherland is you, it is me, it is all the comrades, it is the people of the whole country, it is Chairman Mao and our Party! Defending the motherland is defending our beloved people around us." He read his letter of determination at the meeting and volunteered to participate in war service work. Tian Sui, a student in the Russian Department, wrote to the school's Communist Youth League committee: "I am a member of the Communist Youth League and should stand on the forefront of national defense without hesitation. I will tell my parents: 'In order to love you, I must love the motherland even more.' Without the motherland, there is no home!" Some students' families wrote letters asking them to abandon their studies and go back, and the students read the letters in front of everyone, and their families could not hold them back.
　　The students from worker and peasant backgrounds, based on their personal experience of struggle, vividly compared the motherland's today with the past, and therefore have the highest degree of love for the new motherland. After the decision of the Central People's Government People's Revolutionary Military Commission and the Government Administration Council on recruiting young students and young workers to participate in various military cadre schools was announced, the students' emotions were even higher. Zhu Shichang, a student in the Department of Industrial Management who had worked as an auto worker for six or seven years, said: "In the past, I really didn't know I had a motherland. I was whipped by Japanese devils and beaten by reactionaries' fists. I thought I was like the Soviet children in the movie 'They Have a Homeland', isolated from the motherland. But now the people's motherland has sent me to Renmin University to study, how can I not be grateful and excited, and contribute everything I have to the motherland!" Qian Mei, another student in the Department of Industrial Management who had worked for seven years, wrote a letter to the Party committee saying: "My father died when I was very young, and I became an apprentice at the age of thirteen. My mother wandered in other people's homes like a servant to make a living. ... But today we have turned over and stood up, and after the Party's training, especially after coming to Renmin University, I have further recognized myself, recognized the class, and recognized the era. ... Now the motherland is calling on young people to participate in national defense construction, ... Please approve my request by the Party committee! Let me avenge the sacrificed worker comrades in battle! ..." Both of them had very good academic performance, and were honorably approved to participate in the military cadre school this time.
　　In the two movements, not only was the students' political quality well tested, but also two of the most vivid and effective ideological educations of patriotism, internationalism, and collectivism were carried out, which further improved the students' political awareness.

　　爱国主义教育在中国人民大学
    柏生
    （一）新型大学的特色
    中国人民大学是新中国第一个新型正规大学，它有显著的特色：首先是它的教育完全适合于国家建设的需要和为广大人民服务的目的，因此，它的教学方针是理论与实践的结合。爱祖国、爱人民的精神贯彻在全部教学内容中。整个教育计划是根据新中国的实际需要和苏联的先进经验，在数十位苏联教育专家的直接帮助下进行的。这个学校的另一特色是：它的学生成份主要是革命干部和产业工人，其余则是青年知识分子。工农出身的同学们一般政治质量都非常好，有丰富的实际斗争经验、工作经验和生产经验，以及高度的学习热情。但是他们一般的文化水平却比较低。
    根据新中国的实际需要和苏联高等教育的先进经验，人民大学本科设立了八个系、十一个专修班和一个工农文化补习班。为了有效地进行教学及科学研究工作，并成立了四十一个教研室。同时为了提高全校党与非党干部的政治理论水平，又成立了正规的马列主义夜大学和夜校。
    （二）贯彻在正课中的爱国主义教育
    在这个大学里，爱国主义教育贯彻在全部正课教学中。学校以马列主义毛泽东思想的基本理论知识来武装学生的头脑，这是全部课程的灵魂。各系共同的主要课程有马列主义、政治经济学、中国革命史、人民民主原理等。这些是爱国主义思想教育的理论基础。同学们从政治经济学的学习中，认识了资本主义社会经济发展的规律、认识了帝国主义的本质，认识了促使它崩溃的各种矛盾及其发展，加强了他们的仇美、蔑美、鄙美的思想感情。从中国革命史的学习中，同学们认识了中国新民主主义革命艰苦斗争的里程和经验，知道怎样为巩固和发展人民革命的胜利而斗争。同时各门课程都贯串着爱国主义的思想教育。例如国文课讲解“什么是英雄行为”、“巴甫洛夫给青年的一封信”、龚察尔的短篇小说《永不掉队》、胡乔木同志的《我们所已经达到和还没有达到的成就》以及关于尊重本国语言文字等文章。工农文化补习班学生王学发读了《永不掉队》以后，马上就能连系自己的思想做了检讨。他说：“《永不掉队》这篇文章完全象针对着我的缺点写出来的。……今后我一定要依照对祖国负责的精神，耐心的学习和工作，作一个永不掉队的战士。”又如俄文课本中，苏联专家编写了中国著名劳动英雄李凤莲、李永的故事，苏联英雄马特洛索夫的故事，斯大林论中国革命，国庆节，伟大的胜利等作为材料。地理课也增加了同学对伟大祖国的爱。有的同学过去认为西北是一片荒漠地带，西南康藏等地是穷山恶水，不能改造，但学习了几个月的地理，开始认识到这些地方矿藏丰富，可以改造为发展工业的良好基地。有些同学以为学地理只学些山脉、河流、物产等，并无多大意义。现在知道了学习地理是为了改造自然建设祖国。在抗美援朝运动展开以后，教务部特别指示教员们，要在讲课中结合当前形势中的具体实际材料，校委会并为此作出了正式决议。
    （三）高度的学习热情
    对于同学们来说，学习本身就是人民祖国所要求完成的具体任务，就是爱国主义的实际行动。同学们说：“学习就是战斗”、“战斗地学习”——这是普遍的行动口号。
    同学们在学习上的进步是很快的。特别是占全校同学百分之七十二的工人和革命干部。他们努力克服了初来时文化程度低的困难，获得了很好的成绩。有的同学说：“拿笔杆比拿枪杆还难”。就工农文化补习班来说，最初许多同学都不会写文章，连标点都不懂得，但现在大大不同了。工人出身的金鼎林初入班时，只能写三四百字不通顺的文章，但现在已经能写三千字有内容的文章了。又如写日记，最初大家情绪都不高，认为没什么可写，但经过学习，大家都能根据自己的见闻和感想，有重点的写在日记上。又如本科外交系的同学李荣春，一个红军长征时的小鬼，现在是全校学生会的主席，曾被选为出席世界学生第二届代表大会的代表，因而耽误了两个月的功课。他不但努力赶上了掉下来的功课，而且考试成绩还是最好中的一个。工管系同学金秀玲和阮懿过去都是北京被服厂的女工，只上过高小，刚入学时学习是很吃力的，但她们努力学习，考试成绩都很好。阮懿平时成绩检查是：俄文、化学、数学、绘图均为“优”，物理为“良”。根据去年十一月份平时成绩的检查结果，本科学生各门课程及格的占百分之九十二·七三，专修班学生及格人数占百分之八十以上的有五个班，占百分之九十以上的有六个班。
    （四）课外活动和日常生活
    除了正课学习以外，该校的课外活动和日常生活也充满了爱国主义教育的精神。校内的课外活动主要是在该校共产党组织的领导下，由青年团、学生会、工会等组织推动进行的。课外活动补充与扩大了正课中所获得的知识，扩大眼界。使同学们更多地去接触实际生活，关心现实的政治事件，加强爱国主义的情绪。
    同学们经常进行时事政策学习，阅读报刊。每个学习小组都规定有一份人民日报，同学们每天从这里了解国内外的重大事件，具体认识了自己祖国的伟大和全世界反侵略阵营的光明。当英模大会在北京召开时，报纸就好像一个“光荣榜”，同学们那些天特别兴奋地读着新中国优秀儿女们的革命英雄主义事迹。
    课外活动的方式是很多的：经常有报告、讲演，举办青年讲座和时事讲座。请专家们做国内外时事和学生运动的专题报告。举办每周一次的电影晚会，曾演出了《攻克柏林》、《解放了的中国》、《钢铁意志》、《丹娘》等片，大大鼓舞了同学们的革命热情。同时不时组织大家看好戏，如《保尔柯察金》等。通过参观与展览也曾给大家不少的教育。他们集体到长辛店工厂区去实地参观了创造新纪录运动，到京郊农村访问了农民，也曾组织了秦皇岛的旅行，欣赏祖国的山明水秀的大自然。这些活动主要是在假期中进行的。
    （五）两次运动中的爱国主义教育
    在抗美援朝保家卫国与参加军事干部学校这两次运动的热潮中，人民大学充分表现了爱国主义的精神。将近三千个同学和许多工作干部，都非常愤怒激动，要求以实际行动来抗美援朝保家卫国。申请书、志愿书、决心书像雪片般飞来。全校并很快的展开了慰劳捐献运动。
    同时，同学们开了许多次座谈会，联系个人思想，研讨目前形势。俄文系同学程克雄说：“我从前对于祖国的认识，是比较空洞的，经过政治学习和实际运动的教育，我开始体会到了：祖国是什么？祖国就是你、就是我、就是同志们大家，就是全国人民，就是毛主席和我们的党！保卫祖国就是保卫我们周围亲爱的人们。”他在会上读了自己的决心书，志愿参加了战勤工作。俄文系同学田遂给校团委的信说：“我是一个青年团员，应该义不容辞地站在国防最前线。我将告诉我的父母亲：‘我为了爱你们，更要爱祖国。’没有祖国，就没有家！”有些同学的家里来信叫他们弃学回去，同学们就把信在大家面前读了，家庭拉不住他们的后腿。
    工农出身的同学们，根据切身的斗争经验，鲜明地对比了祖国的今天和过去，因而对新生的祖国怀着最高度的热爱。当中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会和政务院关于招收青年学生青年工人参加各种军事干部学校的决定公布后，同学们的情绪更为高涨。工管系同学朱世昌过去做过六七年的汽车工人，他说：“过去，我真不知道有自己的祖国，我被日本鬼子的鞭子抽过，被反动派的拳头打过，我想我那时就象电影《他们有祖国》里的苏联儿童一样，和祖国隔绝了。但是现在人民祖国送我来人民大学学习，我怎能不感激兴奋，为祖国贡献出我的一切！”另一个做过七年工的工管系同学钱枚，他写信给党委说：“我很小死了父亲，十三岁就当了学徒，母亲流落在他人家象作佣人似的吃口饭。……但是今天我们翻身抬头了，经过党的培养，尤其来到人民大学，我更进一步地认清了自己，认清了阶级，认清了时代。……现在祖国号召青年参加国防建设，……请党委答应我的要求吧！让我在战斗中为牺牲的工人同志报仇！……”他们两人的学习成绩都是很好的，这次光荣地被批准参加了军事干部学校。
    在两次运动中，不仅是很好的考验了同学们的政治品质，而且进行了两次最生动、最有效的爱国主义、国际主义和集体主义的思想教育，进一步提高了同学们的政治觉悟。
