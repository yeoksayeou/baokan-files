　　Preparing New Year's Goods
　　Jin Yu
    It is timely for state-owned trading companies, cooperatives, and already organized private businesses across the country to seize the peak months of winter material exchange, focusing on preparing New Year's goods, vigorously promote material exchange, and invigorate trade between urban and rural areas. Recently, the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government also instructed state-owned trade institutions in various regions to prepare New Year's goods and supply them in large quantities to stabilize prices during the Spring Festival. Specific measures also stipulate that state-owned trading companies in various regions "should immediately check the reserve and deployment of major materials to ensure a large supply to the market." Therefore, state-owned trading companies and cooperatives in various regions should immediately conduct a practical check on their procurement plans.
    Currently, in the material exchange for preparing New Year's goods, two different approaches have emerged: planned procurement and blind procurement. The procurement of New Year's goods by cooperatives in some regions is planned. For example, the Songjiang Provincial Cooperative Federation prepares New Year's goods for its members after investigation and statistics by the heads of trade sections of each county cooperative, based on actual needs, and draws up a list of goods. The Beijing Municipal Cooperative also registers first, then procures according to needs after statistics. This is what state-owned trading companies and cooperatives in various regions should emulate. Some units in the Northeast have been blindly procuring individual goods, resulting in either insufficient or excessive preparation, which will inevitably lead to an imbalance in supply between regions. For example, in most areas of Liaodong, Liaoxi, and Jilin, the brown sugar needed by farmers was either not prepared or prepared in very small quantities; the Jilin Provincial Department Store prepared 180,000 jin of soda ash, while in Songjiang Province, with similar economic conditions and a smaller population than Jilin, the Department Store prepared 1.3 million jin of soda ash, a huge disparity. This phenomenon of blind procurement must attract the attention of state-owned trading companies and cooperatives in various regions. State-owned trading companies and cooperatives in various regions should, according to the instructions of the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government, check their purchasing and sales plans and handle them promptly to avoid insufficient or excessive preparation. State-owned trading companies in various regions should conduct in-depth investigations and studies of specific situations (such as people's purchasing power, the supply and marketing capabilities of cooperatives and private merchants, etc.), and then cooperate with inter-regional references to accurately grasp the seasonal supply and demand patterns. Cooperatives should prepare materials according to the needs of their members, so as to supply the market needs in a planned manner, and avoid the phenomenon that has occurred in some units of state-owned trade organs in the Northeast, where they "do not know the quantity of New Year's goods already prepared and do not know whether it is enough." In this way, we can both meet the needs of the people, stabilize market prices, and accelerate the flow of goods, while avoiding the backlog of funds.

　　准备年货
    近宇
    各地国营贸易公司、合作社，以及已经组织起来的私营商业，抓紧冬季物资交流的旺月，以准备年货为重心，大力开展物资交流，活跃城乡贸易，是恰合时宜的。最近中央人民政府贸易部又指示各地国营贸易机构，准备年货，大量供应，以稳定春节期间物价。其具体办法中又规定各地国营贸易公司“应即检查主要物资储备及部署情况，保证对市场大量供应”。因此，各地国营贸易公司、合作社应立即对自己的采购计划作一切实的检查。
    目前在准备年货的物资交流中，已反映出两种不同的作法，即是有计划的采购与带有盲目性的采购。若干地区合作社的采购年货，是属于有计划的。如松江省联社，给社员购备年货，是经过各县社贸易股长会议的调查、统计，切实地根据需要而订出了货单。北京市合作社也是先行登记，经过统计再按需采购。这是各地国营贸易公司和合作社应当效法的。东北有些单位在购备个别货物上就带有盲目性，以致准备的货物不是不够就是太多，其结果必将使地区间的供应失衡。如辽东、辽西、吉林的大部地区，农民需要的红糖却没有准备或准备的很少；吉林省百货公司准备了十八万斤面碱，而在经济情况相仿佛、人口少于吉林的松江省，百货公司却购备了面碱一百三十万斤，悬殊甚大。这种盲目采购的现象，是必须引起各地国营贸易公司和合作社的注意的。各地国营贸易公司和合作社应根据中央人民政府贸易部的指示，检查自己的进销计划，及时处理，以免准备不足或是太多。各地国营贸易公司应当深入地调查研究具体情况（如人民购买力、合作社、私商供销能力等），再配合地区间的相互参照，正确掌握季节的供需规律。合作社应根据社员需要准备物资，这样有计划地供应市场需要，而不致于像东北国营贸易机关中某些单位所发生的“对已经准备的年货数量并不摸底，不知究竟够不够”的现象。这样，才能达到既满足人民需要，稳定市场价格，又能加速货物流转，而免积压资金。
