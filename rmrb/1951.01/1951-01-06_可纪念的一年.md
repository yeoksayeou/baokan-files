　　A Memorable Year
　　Attending the National Model Worker Representative Conference, Worker of Jinan Industrial Bureau Second Factory, Liu Qingxiang

　　The year 1951 has begun. Over the past year, under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and with the efforts of the people of the whole country, our national construction has achieved great victories. As the people of the whole country celebrate the New Year, I recall a few major events that I personally experienced in the past year:

　　In February last year, with the support of the administration and the Party in our factory, the encouragement of the trade union, and the help of the workers in the fitter department, I created a surface grinder, and the domestically produced surface plate was successfully trial-manufactured. In September, I was elected as a representative of model workers in Jinan City and went to Beijing to attend the National Conference of Representatives of Labor Heroes, Model Workers and Model Soldiers, where I met Chairman Mao. This was something I never dreamed of. When I saw Chairman Mao for the first time, I was so excited that it felt like infinite power was inspiring me. Every word of Chairman Mao was firmly imprinted in my heart. He called on us to "return to our production posts and play the three major roles of leading, backbone, and bridge," and to "build our powerful economic strength and powerful national defense." Comrade Li Lisan told us to "closely link with the masses and unite with technical personnel." These valuable instructions are the direction of my future efforts.

　　When the Second Jinan Municipal People's Congress was held, I was honored to attend this conference. Our working class participated in the leadership of the regime, which is the glory of our entire working class.

　　At the end of the year, in order to encourage creation and improvement, the Jinan Industrial Bureau awarded me a banner at the award ceremony in our factory. I feel that these honors and victories are inseparable from the efforts of all our fellow workers. I hung it in the workshop to constantly inspire all fellow workers to continue to move forward.

　　The resolution of the Second Jinan Municipal Workers' Representative Conference proposed to carry out a patriotic production emulation drive, calling on all fellow workers in the city to use their brains, think of ways, improve working methods, carry out creation and invention, and improve labor productivity during the competition. According to the spirit of this conference, I have made a personal plan and have started to work on it: (1) Improve the surface grinder and add two machines (a polishing machine and a roughing machine), so that twelve surface plates can be produced at a time, which is three times higher than before. I am now working with Mr. Gui Zheng-sheng, an engineer from our factory, to study specific methods. (2) In my spare time, I will study and try to build a winding machine for the water turbine assembly department. It now takes three or four steps to wind the pipes, and it takes more than twenty people to do it. If this winding machine is successfully trial-manufactured, it can save a lot of labor and improve output and quality. The preliminary drawings have been completed, and after the factory director approves it, I can start drawing the exploded views of the machine.

　　Looking back on the past year, although my fellow workers elected me as a model worker, I feel that I have not done enough in all aspects and have not played the role I should have. But I am determined to work harder from the beginning of the New Year in 1951, unite all my fellow workers, work together, overcome all difficulties in production, and make the patriotic production emulation drive a victorious and solid development, so as to improve production with practical actions to defend our motherland.

　　可纪念的一年
    出席全国劳模代表会议代表济南工业局第二厂工人  刘庆祥
    一九五一年又开始了。去年一年来，我们的国家建设在党和毛主席的英明领导和全国人民的努力下，获得了伟大的胜利。在全国人民欢庆新年的时候，回忆了一下过去一年中我亲身经历的几件大事：
    去年二月间，在我们厂的行政和党的支持，工会的鼓励和钳工部工友们的帮助下，我创制了对板精磨机，国产对板试制成功。九月里，我当选了济南市劳模代表，到北京去出席全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议，见到了毛主席，这真是我做梦也想不到的。当我第一次看见毛主席时，心里是那么激动，象是无限的力量鼓舞着我。毛主席的每一句话，都牢牢地记在我心里。他号召我们“回到生产岗位上去起带头、骨干、桥梁三大作用”，“建设我们强大的经济力量和强大的国防力量”。李立三同志告诉我们要“密切联系群众，团结技术人员”，这些宝贵的指示，都是我今后努力的方向。
    济南市第二届各界人民代表会议召开时，我光荣地出席了这个会议，我们工人阶级参加了政权领导，这是我们全体工人阶级的光荣。
    年底，济南工业局为了鼓励创造和改进，在本厂的发奖大会上奖给我一面锦旗。我觉得这些光荣和胜利，和我们全体工友们的努力是分不开的，我把它挂在车间里，让它时刻的鼓舞着全体工友们继续不断地前进。
    在济南市二届职工代表会议的决议中提出开展爱国主义生产竞赛，号召全市工友在竞赛当中，动脑筋、想办法，改进工作方法，进行创造发明，提高劳动生产率。根据这次大会的精神，我做出了个人计划现已开始做：（１）改进对板精磨机，添制两部机器（磨光机和毛坯机），这样一次可以出十二块对板，比过去提高三倍。现在已经和本厂工程师桂正生等共同研究具体办法。（２）在业余时间，研究试造水车装配部的卷筒机。现在卷管子要费三、四道手续，要二十多个人做，如果这部卷筒机试制成功，可以节省不少人工，并能提高产量质量。现在草图已经画出，经过厂长审查同意后，就可以动手画机器的散图。
    回想起过去的一年，虽然工友们选我当了劳模，但是我觉得在各方面做的还很不够，没起到应有的作用，但我有决心，从一九五一年的新年开始，更加努力工作，团结全体工友，共同努力，克服生产中的一切困难，使爱国主义生产竞赛胜利的巩固的开展下去，以实际行动提高生产来保卫我们的祖国。
