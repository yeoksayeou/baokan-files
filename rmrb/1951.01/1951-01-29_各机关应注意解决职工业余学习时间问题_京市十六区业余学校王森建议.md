　　All Agencies Should Pay Attention to Solving the Problem of Employees' After-Work Study Time
    —Suggestion from Wang Sen of the No. 16 District Spare-Time School in Beijing

To the Editor:
    I have some suggestions regarding the current issue of after-work education for employees and cadres.

    I believe that the People's Government places great importance on the education of employees and cadres. While the national economic situation has not yet fundamentally improved, the People's Government has allocated a large amount of funding to establish spare-time schools for employees and cadres, giving the vast number of industrial workers and cadres of worker-peasant origin the opportunity to learn culture. We are extremely grateful for this. These wise measures have also achieved significant results in recent years.

    However, as far as I know, recently the absenteeism rate of students in general spare-time schools in Beijing has reached about 50%. This phenomenon deserves attention.

    The main reason for student absenteeism is being busy with work. Cultural studies for employees and cadres must be carried out in their spare time and must also be standardized. However, due to being busy with work and inconsistent spare time, a high rate of absenteeism has resulted.

    I believe that this is a key issue in carrying out after-work education, so I would like to make the following suggestions:

    (1) Ensure that employee and cadre comrades who are studying culture have two hours of cultural study guaranteed, and do not allow this time to be taken up by policy study and professional study. Current affairs study should be conducted through regular reports by teachers designated by the spare-time school.

    (2) Cultural study performance should be included as part of the employee and cadre attendance assessment.

    (3) Leaders of all agencies should care about and help employees and cadres to study, and attach importance to cadre study. The government should pay attention to commending and rewarding those who have achieved success in this regard.
              Wang Sen, Beijing No. 16 District Spare-Time School

    Editor's Note: The problem raised by reader Wang Sen regarding after-work education is very important. All relevant agencies and enterprises should attach importance to cadre cultural studies and earnestly solve the problem of employee study time.

　　各机关应注意解决职工业余学习时间问题
    ——京市十六区业余学校王森建议编辑同志：
    对于目前职工干部业余教育的问题，我有一些建议。
    我觉得人民政府对于职工干部的教育问题是很重视的。在目前全国经济情况尚未根本好转的情况下，人民政府拨出大批经费来办职工干部业余学校，使广大的产业工人和工农出身的干部有学习文化的机会。这是使我们非常感谢的。这些贤明的措施年来也都获得了显著的成绩。
    可是，据我所知，近来北京市一般业余学校学员的缺课比率，达到了百分之五十左右，这个现象是值得注意的。
    学员缺课的主要原因，是工作忙。职工和干部的文化学习必须在业余时间进行，而且又要统一。可是由于工作忙和业余时间的不一致，就形成了缺课很多的现象。
    我觉得这是开展业余教育工作的一个关键问题，因此我愿意提出如下建议：
    （一）学习文化的职工干部同志能保证有两个钟点的文化学习，不让这个时间被政策学习和业务学习占去。时事学习，由业余学校指定教员，定期作报告。
    （二）文化学习的成绩，作为职工干部考勤内容之一。
    （三）各机关领导上应关心和帮助职工干部学习，重视干部学习。在这方面有成绩的，政府应注意表扬和奖励。
              北京市十六区业余学校  王森
    编者按：读者王森提出的职工业余教育工作上的问题是很重要的。各有关机关、企业应重视干部文化学习，并认真解决职工学习的时间问题。
