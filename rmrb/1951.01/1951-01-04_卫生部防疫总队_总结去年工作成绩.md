Xinhua News Agency, December 31st:

　　The Anti-Epidemic General Team of the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government held a work summary meeting from December 11th to 18th to review its work in 1950. The meeting listened to summary reports from various detachments on their work in Henan, Northern Anhui, Northern Jiangsu, and Pingyuan, as well as reports on the prevention and treatment of Kala-azar, maternal and child health, health education, unity of local Chinese and Western medicine practitioners, and river work sanitation. It discussed the work of the Anti-Epidemic General Team and its detachments over the past eight months and formulated the work guidelines and tasks for 1951.

    The meeting pointed out: The work over the past eight months has been fruitful. Under the correct leadership of the Central Ministry of Health, the team cooperated with the central task of production and self-salvation in severely affected areas, adhered to the principle of prevention first, and promoted vaccination, environmental sanitation, maternal and child healthcare, organization, training, treatment, and publicity. In terms of vaccination, 204,530 people were inoculated against typhoid and cholera, and 322,979 people were vaccinated against smallpox. In terms of organization and training, 1,344 local Chinese and Western medicine practitioners were organized; 1,183 health committees were established, with 9,067 health committee members (including 2,099 who received training); and 2,830 new and old midwives were trained. In terms of treatment, 236,423 initial diagnoses and 166,046 follow-up diagnoses were made (including initial and follow-up diagnoses of infectious diseases such as malaria, Kala-azar, measles, relapsing fever, and typhus). Due to the above work, the team greatly reduced or eliminated diseases such as smallpox, measles, relapsing fever, typhus, Kala-azar, and gastrointestinal diseases, as well as infant mortality rates, which had been prevalent in various disaster areas for many years. This reduced the suffering of the masses in many areas and improved their health conditions, while also enhancing the public's awareness of health. The combination of epidemic prevention work and disaster relief tasks ensured that over 9.74 million disaster-stricken people were spared from major epidemic diseases and protected the health of over 866,000 river workers, completing the river management tasks. The team members improved their political and technical skills in practical work and established a new outlook on life of serving the people.

    However, the meeting considered that the achievements of the anti-epidemic team were only preliminary and required continued efforts. The meeting also called on everyone to learn from the Soviet anti-epidemic team's service spirit in China, which was dedicated to the health of the Chinese people in eradicating the plague. Combining the experiences and lessons of the past eight months, the meeting preliminarily formulated the work guidelines and tasks for 1951. The future work guidelines of the Anti-Epidemic General Team are: to carry out epidemic prevention work in coordination with the government's central tasks such as river management and disaster relief; to eliminate infectious diseases, epidemics, and endemic diseases that pose the greatest threat to people's health; and to further improve epidemic prevention work in conjunction with production and national defense construction. The future tasks of the Anti-Epidemic General Team are: to assist local governments, unite Chinese and Western medicine practitioners, and mobilize the masses; to prevent and eliminate various infectious diseases, epidemics, and endemic diseases that pose the greatest threat and have the highest mortality rate among the working people; to assist local governments in establishing grassroots health organizations; and to assist local governments and cultural and educational institutions in carrying out health publicity and education work and training grassroots health personnel.

　　卫生部防疫总队
    总结去年工作成绩
    【新华社三十一日讯】中央人民政府卫生部防疫总队于十二月十一日至十八日召开了一九五○年的工作总结会议。会议听取了各大队在河南、皖北、苏北、平原等地工作的总结报告和黑热病防治、妇婴卫生、卫生宣教、团结地方中西医、河工卫生等工作报告，讨论了防疫总队及各大队八个月来的工作，并制定了一九五一年的工作方针及任务。
    会议指出：八个月来的工作是有成绩的。该队在中央卫生部的正确领导下，配合了各重灾区生产自救的中心工作，以预防为主的方针，推广了接种、环境卫生、妇婴保健、组织训练治疗和宣传等工作。其中在预防接种工作方面，伤寒霍乱注射计二十万四千五百三十人；种痘计三十二万二千九百七十九人，组训工作方面：组织地方中西医共一千三百四十四人；建立卫生委员会共一千一百八十三个，卫生委员共九千零六十七名（其中经过受训的二千零九十九名）；训练新旧接产员计二千八百三十人，治疗工作方面：初诊二十三万六千四百二十三人，复诊一十六万六千零四十六人（包括疟疾、黑热病、麻疹、回归热、斑疹伤寒等传染病初复诊数字在内）。该队由于进行了以上的工作，使经年流行在各灾区的天花、麻疹、回归热、斑疹伤寒、黑热病、胃肠病等疾病及婴儿死亡率均大为消减或消灭，减少了许多地区群众的疾病痛苦和改善了他们的卫生情况；同时提高了群众对卫生的认识。防疫工作与救灾任务相结合的结果，使九百七十四万余灾民免除了大的疫病侵害，并保障了八十六万六千多河工的健康，完成了治河任务。该队队员们在实际工作中提高了政治与技术水平，树立了为人民服务的新人生观。
    但会议认为：防疫队的工作成绩还只是初步的，还需要继续努力。会议并号召大家要向苏联防疫队在中国扑灭鼠疫全心全意为中国人民健康着想的服务精神学习。会议结合八个月来的经验教训初步制定了一九五一年的工作方针和任务。今后防疫总队的工作方针是：配合政府治河救灾等中心工作开展防疫工作；扑灭危害人民健康最大的传染病、流行病和地方性疾病，并结合生产与国防建设进一步的提高防疫工作。今后防疫总队的工作任务是：协助地方政府，团结中西医，发动群众；预防扑灭危害劳动人民健康最大、死亡率最高的各种传染病、流行病和地方性疾病；协助地方政府，建立基层卫生组织；协助地方政府及文教机关，开展卫生宣传教育工作，培养基层卫生人员等。
