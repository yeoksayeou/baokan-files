The All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles issued the following statement to firmly oppose the US's heinous plot to rearm Japan:

In Korea, US imperialism has been utterly defeated by the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers. Thus, having fully exposed its paper tiger nature, it is attempting to arm Japan to salvage its irretrievable fate.

The entire Chinese people have long been closely watching and resolutely opposing the US's heinous plot to rearm Japan!

We once again shout loudly at the Wall Street bosses, and shout loudly at Truman and the warmonger Dulles, who is carrying out the conspiracy of a separate peace treaty with Japan in Japan: your "wishful thinking" is wrong again!

The Chinese people have long waged a bloody struggle against the most ferocious Japanese imperialism. This long and painful experience has made the Chinese people firmly determined to never allow the resurgence of Japanese militarist forces. This is also the common determination of the Asian people and all peace-loving people in the world.

At the same time, the Japanese people, who have suffered deeply from the scourge of war, will surely unite more closely and wage a resolute struggle against the American aggressors and the traitors within Japan, such as Shigeru Yoshida, who seek personal gain by betraying the country.

Isn't this clear enough? The US's rearming of Japan does not indicate the strength of US imperialism; on the contrary, it indicates its weakness after its disastrous defeat.

Regarding the issue of the peace treaty with Japan, we fully support Premier Zhou's repeated statements that the preparation, drafting, and signing of the treaty must involve the participation of the People's Republic of China. It must first be jointly discussed and prepared by the foreign ministers of China, the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom in order to achieve a comprehensive and just peace treaty with Japan.

We call on all Chinese literary and art workers to do everything possible, through various forms, to expose the US's plot to rearm Japan in the increasingly widespread and in-depth movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea.

　　全国文联发表声明
    坚决反对美帝武装日本
    【本报讯】中华全国文学艺术界联合会，为坚决反对美国重新武装日本的罪恶阴谋，发表声明如下：
    美帝国主义在朝鲜已被朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军打得惨败，因此在完全暴露了纸老虎的原形的情况下，又妄图武装日本以挽救永远不能挽回的失败的命运。
    全中国人民很久以来，就密切注视并坚决反对美国重新武装日本的罪恶阴谋！
    我们再一次地向华尔街的老板们大喝一声，向杜鲁门和正在日本进行片面对日和约的阴谋活动的战争贩子——杜勒斯大喝一声，你们的“如意算盘”又打错啦！
    中国人民曾长期的和最凶恶的日本帝国主义作了流血的斗争。这个长期的流血的痛苦经历使中国人民下了一个坚定的决心，决不允许日本军国主义势力的死灰复燃。这也是亚洲人民和全世界一切爱好和平的人民的共同的决心。
    同时饱受战争祸害的日本人民，必将更紧密地团结起来，对美国侵略者和日本国内卖国求荣的吉田茂等败类，进行坚决的斗争。
    这还不明白吗？美帝重新武装日本，并不能表示美帝国主义的强大，相反地，正表示了它惨败后的虚弱。
    关于对日和约的问题，我们完全拥护周外长历次的声明，即和约的准备、拟制与签订必须有我中华人民共和国参加。必须先经中、苏、美、英四国外长会议共同讨论准备，以实现全面的公正的对日和约。
    我们号召全中国的文学艺术工作者们，在日益广泛而深入的抗美援朝运动中，尽一切可能，通过各种形式，揭露美帝重新武装日本的阴谋。
