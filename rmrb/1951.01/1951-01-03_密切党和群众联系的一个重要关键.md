The decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China "On Establishing a Propaganda Network for the People in the Whole Party" is an extremely important step towards strengthening the ties between the Party and the masses. The decision correctly points out: "One of the main weaknesses of the Party's current propaganda work among the people is that Party organizations at all levels often regard it as a task for a few people and a temporary one, and have not established the necessary system to make it a regular task for all Communist Party members, and to be systematically led and managed by Party committees at all levels." Of course, pointing out the weaknesses of the Party's propaganda work does not in any way negate the efforts and achievements already made by many Party organizations and many Party cadres in propaganda work. In fact, the achievements of propaganda work are not small, and a lot of experience has been accumulated. However, these achievements and experiences are far from enough compared to the vast needs of the people, so we must make great efforts to improve propaganda work. This means raising it to the point where it can become a system, a regular task for all Communist Party members.

It cannot be denied that propaganda work in many places is not done well enough; some places simply have not seriously engaged in propaganda work. In many places, workers, farmers, and other working people have not received systematic propaganda for a long time, and do not know what the Communist Party and the People's Government are doing and will do. Therefore, they feel extremely dissatisfied. They urgently need various propaganda explanations on political, policy, and practical work issues. They are eager to hear propagandists speak to them regularly, and to hear the leaders of the Party and the People's Government speak directly to them. However, at present, we have not universally established propagandists in factories, rural areas, and among the broad masses of the people, and the leaders of the Party and the People's Government, such as provincial Party secretaries and provincial government chairmen, prefectural Party secretaries and commissioners, municipal Party secretaries and mayors, county Party secretaries and county heads, rarely or do not go to factories, rural areas, and among the broad masses of the people to meet with the masses directly and speak to them. This situation must obviously be improved quickly. The decision of the Central Committee of the Party points out: "It is necessary to systematically establish a regular propaganda network for the people, that is, to set up propagandists in each Party branch, report givers in Party leadership organs at all levels, and establish a certain system for the work of propagandists and report givers." "Each report giver must make at least one political report to gatherings and representative conferences of urban and rural people every two months." When this decision is implemented throughout the Party, it will greatly improve the relationship between our Party and the people of the whole country.

The inseparable connection with workers, farmers, intellectuals, and other revolutionary masses is one of the main characteristics of the Communist Party. In leading the struggle of the people and the work of national construction, our Party organizations at all levels do not use the method of government organs issuing orders and military organs commanding troops, but the method of persuasion. We must rely on the direct interaction of Party leaders with the broad masses of the people to systematically consolidate the connection between Party organizations and the masses. Our Party clearly stipulates in the general program of the Party Constitution: "Communists must have the spirit of wholeheartedly serving the Chinese people, must establish extensive ties with the working masses, the peasant masses, and other revolutionary people, and must always pay attention to consolidating and expanding this connection." The obligations of Party members stipulated in the Party Constitution clearly state: "Serve the people, consolidate the Party's ties with the people, understand and promptly reflect the needs of the people, and explain the Party's policies to the people." Therefore, every Communist Party member, including the main responsible persons of Party organizations at all levels, should undoubtedly regard it as his glorious obligation to regularly meet directly with the masses, speak to the masses, and carry out propaganda and explanation. And every leader of the masses can only draw infinite strength from establishing such regular direct contact with the masses. Comrade Stalin compared the Bolshevik Party to Antaeus in ancient Greek mythology. Antaeus drew great strength by relying on contact with his mother, the earth. Communist Party members must maintain regular direct contact with the masses in order to gain invincible strength.

Some of our comrades do not understand this principle, and insist on blaming the "backwardness of the masses," shouting that "work is difficult to do." These comrades do not understand that if the masses are really "backward," then the only responsibility lies with the Communist Party members for abandoning propaganda to the masses. If Communist Party members do not propagate, it is not easy for the masses to know what is happening in the world, it is not easy to understand the truth of all problems, and they may fall into a dark fog. Reactionary rumors often take the opportunity to enter and deceive the masses in this situation. As long as Communist Party members have conducted propaganda and explanation to the people, the "backward" phenomenon of the masses can definitely be broken. Countless facts prove that where propaganda work is done well, the masses are united and work is easy to do. Facts prove that our Party's propaganda, especially the propaganda directly carried out by the main responsible persons of Party organizations at all levels to the masses, has extremely high prestige among the masses. The reason why the people need the Communist Party is because the Communist Party is the most advanced and most conscious part of the people, which can constantly influence the masses and lead them to the light and to victory. In the long revolutionary struggle in the past, our Party has continuously carried out propaganda to the people, pointing out the road to victory in the Chinese revolution, and the facts have all proved that our Party's propaganda is completely correct and responsible. However, some comrades also say, "Precisely because we represent the truth, there is no need to propagate; reactionary rumors violate the truth and cannot become a climate, and can be defeated without being attacked." This is very wrong. If the truth is not propagated, then what is the meaning of this truth? If one is a Communist Party member but does not propagate the truth to the masses, then why should there be such a Communist Party member? The truth must be propagated. Propagating the truth so that it is grasped by the broad masses of the people will produce great material strength; and the main responsibility for propagating the truth must be borne by Communist Party members who are most determined to fight for the truth.

The decision of the Central Committee of the Party says: "Our Party has a tradition of carrying out propaganda to the people." Yes, in the history of our Party, there have been many outstanding leaders who are the most respected and outstanding propagandists among the people. The Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army led by Comrade Mao Zedong took "propaganda when entering and exiting" as one of its important disciplines. Comrade Mao Zedong's Changgang Township Survey in Xingguo County, Jiangxi Province in 1933 recorded the activities of propaganda teams in the villages of the revolutionary base area at that time. A township propaganda team had 23 members, including the captain and members, who conducted propaganda for "expanding the Red Army," "economic construction," and "commemorative festivals"; they often studied propaganda materials and methods, "how to make the masses understand better." We should fully promote this excellent tradition of propaganda work. Prior to this, in the Gutian Conference in western Fujian in December 1929, Comrade Mao Zedong drafted the famous "Resolution of the Ninth Congress of the Fourth Army of the Chinese Communist Party." It not only made important regulations for the army's propaganda work, but also for the propaganda work of the entire Party: "The task of the Red Army's propaganda work is to expand political influence and win over the broad masses. Only by realizing this propaganda task can we achieve the Red Army's overall task of organizing the masses, arming the masses, establishing political power, eliminating reactionary forces, and promoting a revolutionary upsurge. Therefore, the Red Army's propaganda work is the first major task of the Red Army. If this work is neglected, the main task of the Red Army is abandoned, which is equivalent to helping the ruling class exploit the Red Army's power." At that time, the main organizational form of propaganda work to the masses was the propaganda team. He stipulated: "The Red Army's propaganda team is an important tool for the Red Army's propaganda work. If the propaganda team is not well organized, a large part of the Red Army's propaganda task will be abandoned. Therefore, the issue of organizing and training the propaganda team is one of the tasks that the Party must intensify its efforts to do at present. The first step in this work is to theoretically correct the general view of officers and soldiers who despise propaganda work and propaganda teams." Our current establishment of a propaganda network for the people in the whole Party still follows the principles and spirit indicated by Comrade Mao Zedong. The propaganda network to be established now is a major development of the propaganda team of the past under new historical conditions.

Once such a propaganda network is universally established throughout the country, the connection between our Party and the broad masses of the people will be a hundred times closer. It will ensure that our Party's propaganda work can be carried out to the people anytime and anywhere. This is also the basic requirement of the Party's propaganda work. Comrade Stalin pointed out in an article in 1906, "The Current Situation and the Joint Congress of the Labor Party," "Agitation is one of the Party's main tools anytime and anywhere." (Here, the agitation mentioned is more appropriately translated as propaganda according to Chinese habits.) This kind of propaganda work is to propagate and explain to the people in simple and popular forms about current domestic and international affairs, the policies of the Party and the People's Government, the tasks of the people, especially the direct tasks of the time and place, and the exemplary experience of the people in production and other work, etc., and to criticize various reactionary rumors and erroneous ideas circulating among the people, improve the political consciousness and political vigilance of the people, and make the broad masses of the people more actively act to complete various work tasks.

Let all Communist Party members and Communist Party cadres strive to implement the decision of the Central Committee of the Party, conduct propaganda to the broad masses of the people regularly and directly, strengthen the ties between the Party and the masses, and ensure the victory of the people's revolutionary cause and the work of national construction.

### 密切党和群众联系的一个重要关键

　　密切党和群众联系的一个重要关键
    中共中央发布“关于在全党建立对人民群众的宣传网的决定”，是为了密切党和群众联系的一个极重要的步骤。决定中正确地指出：“目前党对人民群众的宣传工作的主要弱点之一，就是各级党的组织往往把它当作一部分人的和临时性的工作，而没有建立必要的制度，使它成为全体共产党员的经常性的工作，并由各级党的委员会给以有系统的领导和管理。”当然，指出党的宣传工作的弱点，丝毫没有抹杀党的许多组织和许多党员干部在宣传工作中已有的努力和成绩。事实上，宣传工作已有的成绩是不小的，已经积累的经验也是不少的。但是这些成绩和经验比之于人民群众的广大需要还是非常不够，因此，必须以极大的努力，使宣传工作提高一步。这就是要提高到使它能够成为一种制度，成为全体共产党员的经常性的工作。
    不能否认，现在有很多地方的宣传工作，是做得不够的和不好的；甚至于有的地方简直没有认真来做宣传工作。有很多地方的工人、农民和其他劳动群众，长时期没有受到系统的宣传，不知道共产党和人民政府在干些什么，将要干些什么，因此，他们感到极不满足。他们非常迫切地需要关于政治的、政策的和实际工作问题的各种宣传解释。他们渴望经常听到宣传员对他们讲话，渴望听到党和人民政府的领导者直接对他们讲话。但是，目前我们在工厂、农村和广大人民群众中，却还没有普遍设立宣传员，党和人民政府的领导者，如省委书记和省人民政府主席、地委书记和专员、市委书记和市长、县委书记和县长，也都很少或者没有到工厂、农村和广大人民群众中去，直接与群众见面，对群众讲话。这种情况显然是必须迅速加以改善的。党中央的决定指出：“必须有系统地建立对人民群众的经常性的宣传网，即在党的每个支部设立宣传员，在党的各级领导机关设立报告员，并建立关于宣传员报告员工作的一定制度。”“每个报告员每两个月必须向城乡人民群众的集会和代表会议作至少一次政治报告。”这个决定在全党执行起来，就会使我们的党和全国人民群众的关系有一个极大的改进。
    与工人、农民、知识分子及其他革命群众的不可分割的联系，是共产党的主要特点之一。我们党的各级组织，在领导人民群众的斗争和国家建设工作中，不是用政府机关发布命令和军事机关指挥部队的方法，而是用说服的方法。我们要依靠党的领导者们同广大人民群众的直接往来，有系统地巩固党的组织与群众的联系。我们的党在党章总纲中曾明确规定：“中国共产党人必须具有全心全意为中国人民服务的精神，必须与工人群众、农民群众及其他革命人民建立广泛的联系，并经常注意巩固与扩大这种联系。”党章所规定的党员义务中明白地写着：“为人民群众服务，巩固党与人民群众的联系，了解并及时反映人民群众的需要，向人民群众解释党的政策。”因此，每一个共产党员，包括党的各级组织的主要负责人在内，经常直接与群众见面，对群众讲话，进行宣传解释，无疑地应该成为他的光荣义务。并且每一个群众的领袖，也只有在与群众建立这样经常的直接的联系中才能吸取无穷的力量。斯大林同志曾把布尔塞维克党同古代希腊神话中的安泰相比。安泰依靠与他的母亲，即土地的接触而吸取了巨大的力量。共产党员更必须保持与群众经常直接的接触，才能取得不可战胜的力量。
    我们有些同志不了解这个道理，偏要怪“群众落后”，叫喊“工作不好做”。这些同志不懂得：如果群众真的“落后”，那么唯一的责任就在于共产党员放弃了对群众的宣传。共产党员不宣传，群众就不容易知道天下大事，就不容易明白一切问题的真相，就可能堕入黑暗的迷雾中去。反动谣言往往就在这种情况下乘机而入，欺骗群众。而只要共产党员向人民群众进行了宣传解释，群众的“落后”现象就一定可以被打破。无数事实证明，宣传工作做得好的地方，群众就齐心了，工作就好做了。事实证明我们党的宣传，特别是党的各级组织的主要负责人对群众直接进行的宣传，在群众中具有极高的威信。人民群众所以需要共产党，就因为共产党是人民群众中最先进最觉悟的部分，它能够不断地影响群众，领导群众走向光明，走向胜利。我们党在过去长期革命斗争中，向人民群众已经进行了不断的宣传，指出中国革命胜利的道路，事实都已经一一证明了我们党的宣传是完全正确的和负责的。但是，也有的同志说，“正因为我们代表着真理，就用不着宣传；反动谣言违反真理，成不了什么气候，可以不攻自破。”这是非常错误的。如果对真理不加以宣传，那末，这个真理又有什么意义呢？如果身为共产党员而不向群众宣传真理，那末，何必要有这样的共产党员呢？真理是必须加以宣传的。宣传真理，使它为广大人民群众所掌握，它就会产生出巨大的物质力量；而宣传真理的主要责任，必须由最坚决地为真理而奋斗的共产党员来担负。
    党中央的决定中说：“我们的党有向人民群众作宣传的传统”。是的，在我们党的历史上，有许多杰出的领导者，都是在人民群众中最受尊重的卓越的宣传员。毛泽东同志所领导的中国工农红军，以“进出要宣传”作为自己的重要纪律之一。毛泽东同志于一九三三年，在江西兴国县所进行的长冈乡调查，曾记载当时革命根据地的乡村中宣传队活动的情况。一个乡的宣传队有队长及队员二十三人，他们为“扩大红军”、“经济建设”、“纪念节”等做宣传；经常研究宣传材料和宣传方法，“乌吗（怎样）能使群众更了解”。这种宣传工作的优良传统，我们应该加以充分的发扬。在此以前，在一九二九年十二月的闽西古田会议中，毛泽东同志起草了著名的“中国共产党红军第四军第九次代表大会决议案”。其中不但对于军队的，同时也对于全党的宣传工作做了重要的规定：“红军宣传工作的任务，就是扩大政治影响争取广大群众。由这个宣传任务之实现，才可以达到组织群众，武装群众，建立政权，消灭反动势力，促进革命高潮等红军的总任务。所以红军的宣传工作，是红军第一个重大工作。若忽视了这个工作，就是放弃了红军的主要任务，就等于帮助统治阶级剥削红军的势力。”当时对群众宣传工作的主要组织形式是宣传队。他规定：“红军的宣传队，是红军宣传工作重要的工具，宣传队若不弄好，红军的宣传任务就荒废了一个大的部分。因此关于宣传队的整理训练问题，是目前党要加紧努力的工作之一。这个工作的第一步，就是要从理论上纠正官兵中一般对宣传工作及宣传队轻视的观点。”我们现在要在全党建立对人民群众的宣传网，仍然是遵循着毛泽东同志所指示的这些原则和精神的，现在所要建立的宣传网，正是当年的宣传队在新的历史条件下的一个重大的发展。
    这样的宣传网一旦在全国范围内普遍建立起来，我们的党和广大人民群众的联系就将百倍地密切了。它将保证我们党的宣传工作能够随时随地向人民群众来进行。这也正是党的宣传工作的基本要求。斯大林同志于一九○六年在“目前形势与工党的联合代表大会”一文中指出，“鼓动随时随地都是党的主要工具之一。”（这里所说的鼓动，根据汉语的习惯，译为宣传更恰当些。）这种宣传工作是以简单通俗的形式，向人民群众宣传解释关于国内外时事、党和人民政府的政策、人民群众的任务特别是当时当地的直接任务，以及人民群众在生产劳动和其他工作中的模范经验等等，并批驳各种反动谣言及在人民群众中流传的错误思想，提高人民群众的政治觉悟和政治警惕性，使广大人民群众更积极地行动起来，完成各项工作任务。
    让我们全体共产党员和共产党的干部努力执行党中央的决定，经常地直接地向广大人民群众进行宣传，更加密切党和群众的联系，保证人民革命事业和国家建设工作的胜利。
