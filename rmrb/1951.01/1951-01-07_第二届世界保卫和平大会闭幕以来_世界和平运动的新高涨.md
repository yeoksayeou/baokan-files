　　New Upsurge in the World Peace Movement Since the Closing of the Second World Peace Congress
    Yao Pingfang
    The Second World Peace Congress was held in Warsaw from November 16th to 20th last year. Peace-loving people from eighty-one countries sent representatives to participate, demonstrating the unprecedented unity and strength of the world's peace forces. The congress made two important resolutions: first, a declaration to the people of the world, which put forward a powerful call: "Peace must not be waited for, it must be fought for"; second, a letter to the United Nations Organization, pointing out that the World Peace Council elected by the Warsaw Peace Congress bears the lofty task of conforming to the vital interests of the people of all countries and ensuring a stable and lasting peace, and will accomplish its mission.
    The convening of the congress and the great achievements it obtained gave tremendous encouragement to peace advocates around the world. The resolutions of the congress have spread deeply into people's hearts around the globe, and more peace advocates have taken practical actions to defend peace. The peace movements in various countries have rapidly entered a new stage.
    International democratic organizations with broad membership support the action program proposed by the congress. The Executive Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions issued a letter to trade unions and workers around the world on December 9th, calling for immediate action to refuse to produce munitions and to demand disarmament, in order to crush the US imperialist plan of aggression against the Korean and Chinese people. The World Federation of Democratic Youth Council passed a resolution on December 4th, calling on young people around the world to take action, widely publicize the resolutions, and fight for the enactment of laws to protect peace. In order to strengthen the unity of young people in various countries, it has been decided to hold the Third World Youth Peace Warrior Festival in Berlin this summer. The International Democratic Women's Federation also responded to the resolutions and strengthened its struggle to defend peace.
    The Soviet people have strengthened the power of the peace camp with their great construction achievements. In 1950, the Soviet people completed the post-war five-year plan ahead of schedule and greatly exceeded the original targets. They are now starting to carry out various great communist constructions to further enhance the power of the peace fortress.
    The Chinese people responded to the call of the congress with the great victory of the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea. The annihilating blows given to the American aggressor bandits on the Korean battlefield by the Chinese People's Volunteers have made an inestimable contribution to the world peace struggle. The victory of the Chinese people has not only guaranteed peace in the Far East and the world, but has also encouraged all oppressed people to rise up, overthrow the imperialist aggressors, and strive for lasting world peace.
    The People's Democratic countries of Europe: the people of the German Democratic Republic, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, etc., responded to the resolutions with great enthusiasm. Mass rallies in various countries celebrating the achievements of the congress have turned into great peace demonstrations. Germany, Romania, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, and other countries have all promulgated laws to protect peace based on the resolutions of the congress. In the People's Democratic countries, not only is war propaganda strictly prohibited, but all propaganda tools serve to protect peace and educate the people in the spirit of international friendship and cooperation. At the end of 1950, the democratic countries reviewed their achievements of the year, which have given them the strength to implement larger-scale economic plans. The working people are striving for a greater increase in national strength through creative labor in order to defend the cause of peace.
    The achievements of the Peace Congress and its resolutions have had a huge impact in capitalist countries. The movement of people in various countries against war and aggression has developed unprecedentedly vigorously. When Truman issued a statement on November 30th about expanding the war in Korea, the people of the United States and Britain sent tens of thousands of protest telegrams to the White House and Attlee. They opposed war and demanded peace. Workers in many enterprises in France and Italy held short strikes. In Rome, tens of thousands of people demonstrated in front of the parliament and foreign affairs departments. Mass rallies in many cities demanded that Italy withdraw from the North Atlantic aggressive bloc. People in Sydney, Australia, also held an anti-intimidation demonstration in front of the US consulate. The surging protest movement proves that the victory of the Chinese people in resisting US aggression and aiding Korea has greatly encouraged the fighting spirit of the people of the world, prompting more people to take combat actions to strive for peace.
    The peace movement in the United States is increasingly strengthening. When the US representatives attending the congress returned home, the welcoming masses put forward powerful slogans of "Don't fight China" and "Stop the war of aggression against Korea." In the past six months, local committees of 110 peace committees have been established in various cities in the United States. The peace rally held in New York in December passed a resolution calling for universal disarmament and inviting the People's Republic of China to participate in the United Nations. Representatives of many trade unions jointly demanded the convening of a conference of the five major powers. The American Women's Organization for the Defense of Peace led two thousand women in a demonstration at the UN headquarters, demanding an end to the aggression against Korea. The Peace Committee of Italy widely organized discussions on reducing military budgets in various urban areas, hospitals, schools, and other institutions. The Peace Committee has expanded its base and deeply united various religious factions to jointly seek peace. The peace movement in Britain has developed significantly. Many mass peace rallies have put forward the demand not to participate in the war of aggression against China. The Peace Committee has submitted a peace appeal to the parliament. Peace advocates in Denmark and Finland have also urged the parliament to enact peace laws. Tram workers in Oslo, Norway, have organized a peace committee. The Canadian Peace Committee demanded the cancellation of US bases in Canada. Japanese workers and students held a "Ban Atomic Bombs" peace vote on December 1st to protest Truman's statement. The Peace Committee of Pakistan passed a resolution opposing war, and public opinion in Indonesia has severely criticized the aggressive policies of the United States.
    After the North Atlantic Group countries decided to arm West Germany in Brussels, Belgium, on December 19th, the people of Europe launched another large-scale protest movement, expressing their firm will and strength to oppose aggression. In many places in Britain, housewives went door-to-door collecting signatures against expanding the war of aggression. On December 31st, thousands of people in London demonstrated against the war-mongers rebuilding the West German army. The petitioning crowd of Parisians marched to the president on December 11th to present a petition protesting the arming of West Germany, shouting the slogan "We want peace" in front of the US embassy. On November 25th, more than 1,900 dockworkers in the port of Bordeaux went on strike to protest the presence of US troops and the arrival of US military supplies at the port, demanding the immediate withdrawal of US troops. Workers in various industries in the port of Saint-Nazaire went on strike on December 20th to protest the French government's supply of the port to the United States for loading and unloading war materials to West Germany. The people of West Germany strongly opposed the rebuilding of the Nazi army. By mid-December, the signature campaign for peace and against remilitarization in Berlin had received 868,495 signatures. People in Hamburg and Hanover generally opposed military buildup. Almost all police officers in the Stuttgart and Ludwigsburg areas refused to participate in the so-called "mobile police" training. The people of Jerusalem on the eastern shore of the Mediterranean also responded to the call of the Israeli Communist Party and demonstrated on December 23rd to protest the rebuilding of the West German Nazi army. Holding flags of "We want peace" and "We want life," they broke through police obstruction and successfully held a protest rally in front of the US Consulate General.
    The new upsurge of the world peace movement shows that the peace-loving people are becoming increasingly aware that they must take practical actions to stop war instigators. The Chinese people's movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea is a victorious banner, which will continue to inspire peace warriors all over the world, and will unite a wider range of forces to stop the war into an irresistible torrent.

　　第二届世界保卫和平大会闭幕以来
    世界和平运动的新高涨
    姚平芳
    第二届世界保卫和平大会于去年十一月十六日至二十日在华沙举行，八十一个国家的爱好和平的人民都选派代表去参加，显示了全世界和平力量的空前团结与壮大。大会作出了两项重要的决议：第一是告全世界人民的宣言，宣言中提出了有力的号召：“绝不能等待和平，必须去争取和平”；第二是致联合国组织书，指出华沙和平大会选出的世界和平理事会担负着符合各国人民切身利益，确保稳固与持久和平的崇高任务，并将完成它的使命。
    大会的召开和大会所获得的伟大成就，给了全世界和平拥护者以莫大的鼓舞。大会决议已深入人心地传遍全球，更多的和平拥护者已采取了保卫和平的实际行动。世界各国的和平运动已迅速地步入了新的阶段。
    拥有广大会员群众的国际民主组织，一致支持大会提出的行动纲领。世界工联执行局于十二月九日发表了告全世界工会及工人书，号召立即采取行动，拒绝生产军火，要求裁减军备，以粉碎美帝国主义对朝鲜人民和中国人民的侵略计划。世界民主青联理事会于十二月四日通过决议，号召全世界青年行动起来，广泛宣传和大决议，为制订保卫和平的法律而战斗。为了加强各国青年的团结，已决定今年夏天在柏林举行第三届世界青年和平战士联欢大会。国际民主妇联也响应了和大决议，为保卫和平而加强斗争。
    苏联人民以伟大的建设成就加强了和平阵营的力量。一九五○年苏联人民已提前完成了战后五年计划，并大大超过了原定的目标。现在正开始进行各项共产主义伟大建设，以进一步提高和平堡垒的威力。
    中国人民以抗美援朝斗争的伟大胜利响应了和大的号召。中国人民志愿军在朝鲜战场上给美国侵略强盗的歼灭性打击，已经给全世界和平斗争作了不可估量的贡献。中国人民的胜利不但已保障了远东与世界的和平，并且已鼓舞了一切被压迫的人民奋起打倒帝国主义侵略者，争取持久的世界和平。
    欧洲的人民民主国家：德意志民主共和国、波、捷、匈、罗、保、阿尔巴尼亚等国的人民，以极大的热情响应了和大决议，各国庆祝和大成就的群众大会已变成了伟大的和平示威。德、罗、匈、捷、保等国均已根据和大决议颁布了保卫和平法案。在人民民主国家里，不但严厉禁止战争宣传，并且使一切宣传工具为保卫和平服务，以国际友好合作的精神教育人民。在一九五○年终，各民主国家都检阅了一年的成就，这些成就已使各国有力量来执行更大规模的经济计划了。劳动人民正以创造性的劳动争取国力的更加高涨，以保卫和平的事业。
    和平大会所获得的成就及大会的决议，已在资本主义国家引起了巨大的影响。各国人民反对战争、反对侵略的运动已空前蓬勃地开展起来。当杜鲁门于十一月三十日发表关于在朝鲜扩大战争的声明之后，美国和英国人民曾向白宫和艾德礼发出了成千成万封的抗议电报。他们反对战争、要求和平。法国和意大利许多企业的工人都举行了短期的罢工。在罗马，成千上万的人民到议会和外交部门前举行示威。许多城市的群众大会要求意大利退出北大西洋侵略集团。澳大利亚的悉尼城的人民也在美国领事馆门前举行了反恫吓的示威。抗议运动的汹涌澎湃，证明中国人民抗美援朝的胜利已大大鼓舞了世界人民的斗志，使更多的人采取了争取和平的战斗行动。
    美国的和平运动正日益加强。当美国出席和大的代表返国时，欢迎群众提出了有力的“不与中国作战”和“停止侵朝战争”的口号。半年来美国各城市已成立了一百一十个和平委员会的地方委员会。十二月在纽约举行的和平集会通过决议要求普遍裁军和邀请中华人民共和国参加联合国。许多工会的代表联名要求召开五大国会议，美国妇女保卫和平组织曾领导两千名妇女在联合国会址举行示威，要求停止侵略朝鲜。意大利的和平委员会在各市区、医院、学校等机关广泛组织了缩减军事预算的讨论。和平委员会已扩大了基础，深入团结各个宗教派别，以共谋和平。英国的和平运动显著地发展了，许多群众性的和平集会都提出了不参加侵略中国战争的要求，和平委员会已将和平呼吁书送交议会。丹麦和芬兰的和平拥护者也已敦促议会制订和平法案，挪威奥斯陆的电车工人组织了和平委员会。加拿大和平委员会要求取消美国在加拿大的基地。日本的工人与学生为抗议杜鲁门声明，曾于十二月一日举行了“禁止原子弹”的和平投票。巴基斯坦的和平委员会通过决议反对战争，印尼的舆论界曾经痛斥了美国的侵略政策。
    十二月十九日北大西洋集团国家在比京布鲁塞尔决定武装西德之后，欧洲人民再度展开了规模壮大的抗议运动，表示了坚决反对侵略的意志与力量。英国许多地方的家庭妇女，挨门逐户地征集反对扩大侵略战争的签名。十二月三十一日，伦敦数千人举行示威，反对战争贩子重建西德军队。巴黎人民的请愿队伍于十二月十一日浩浩荡荡地向总统呈递了抗议武装西德的请愿书，人们在美国使馆前高呼“我们要和平”的口号。十一月二十五日，波尔多港的一千九百多名码头工人举行罢工，抗议美军进驻和美国军火运抵该港，要求美军立即撤退。圣那最尔港的各业工人于十二月二十日举行罢工，抗议法国政府把该港供给美国装卸运往西德的战争物资。西德人民强烈反对重建纳粹军队，柏林争取和平反对重新军国主义化的签名运动，到十二月中旬已有八十六万八千四百九十五人签了名。汉堡与汉诺威的人民普遍反对建军。斯图加特和路德威格斯堡地区差不多所有的警察都拒绝参加所谓“机动警察”的训练。地中海东岸的耶路撒冷的人民也响应以色列共产党的号召，于十二月二十三日举行示威，抗议重建西德纳粹军队。他们举着“我们要和平”，“我们要生活”的旗帜，冲破了警察阻挠，胜利地在美国总领事馆前举行了抗议大会。
    全世界和平运动的新高涨，显示和平人民已愈来愈觉悟到必须以实际行动制止战争挑拨者。中国人民抗美援朝的运动是一面胜利的旗帜，它将不断鼓舞全世界和平战士，并将团结更广泛的制止战争的力量成为不可抗御的洪流。
