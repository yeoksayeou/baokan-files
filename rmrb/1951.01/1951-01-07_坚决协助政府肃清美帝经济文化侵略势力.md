　　【Our Paper News】People in various places warmly support the order of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government regarding the control of American property in our country and the freezing of all public and private American deposits in our country, as well as the decision on the policy of handling cultural education, relief agencies, and religious organizations that accept American subsidies.
            Shanghai Religious and Relief Circles
    Wu Yaozong and Liu Liangmo of the National Association of the YMCA of China, Deng Yuzhi of the National Association of the YWCA of China, Wu Gaozi of the National Christian Council of China, Xie Songsan of the Shanghai Christian Federation, Zhang Bohuai of the Christian Publishing Association, and 21 other Christian figures in Shanghai jointly issued a declaration on the 3rd, stating: "After suffering defeat in the war of aggression against Korea, U.S. imperialism brazenly announced the control of Chinese public and private property in the United States and the severing of remittances, and vainly attempted to threaten all Chinese religious, cultural, and relief organizations accepting American subsidies by cutting off their economic resources. This shameless attempt by U.S. imperialism will only make Christians throughout China more clearly recognize the aggressive face of U.S. imperialism and more firmly stand on the patriotic position to strive for the construction of New China. The decision of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government not only powerfully strikes at the conspiracy of U.S. imperialism but also fully takes into account the needs of Christian undertakings. We resolutely respond to this decision of the Government Administration Council and quickly complete the reform movement of Chinese Christianity." While issuing the statement, the aforementioned Christian figures are actively preparing and studying specific methods to implement and abide by the decision of the Government Administration Council.
    The Shanghai Branch of the China People's Relief Association also issued a statement saying: "The implementation of this decision fully conforms to the interests of our people. We are determined to implement it quickly and thoroughly." Many children's educational institutions and church hospitals in the city that accept American subsidies, such as the Shanghai Juvenile Village for educating homeless children and the Hongren, Tongren, Ximen Women and Children's, and Bethel Church Hospitals, in a jointly issued declaration, also unanimously expressed their determination to support and implement the decision of the Government Administration Council with practical actions in the spirit of self-reliance.
            Schools and Groups in Guangzhou Subsidized by the U.S.
    Zhao Guanhai, vice president of the Guangzhou Christian Association, and Wang Yidun, general secretary of the Guangzhou YMCA, unanimously believe that the decision of the Government Administration Council is a correct measure to further eliminate the activities of U.S. imperialism in using religious undertakings to carry out aggression against our country.
    Chen Xujing, president of Lingnan University, and Chen Mujie, principal of Peidao Girls' High School (founded by the American Christian Church), also firmly expressed their full support for the decision of the Government Administration Council. Hu Jingzhao, chairman of the Lingnan University Student Union, said excitedly: "I represent more than 1,300 students of Lingnan University in expressing our determination to implement the decision of the Government Administration Council under the leadership of the People's Government."
    Liao Fengzhen, the person in charge of the Guangzhou Children's Welfare Garden, revealed the shameless conspiracy of the American pastor Li Shizeng to force all the staff of the Welfare Garden to submit to him by stopping American subsidies to the Welfare Garden, and said: "We believe that the Children's Welfare Garden will be better run after it is taken over by the China People's Relief Association."
            Wuhan, Fuzhou, and Hangzhou Circles
    The Preparatory Committee of the Central South District Democratic Women's Federation stated: Women in the Central South District will work with the people of the whole country to assist the government in monitoring all the property of American enterprises within our country, and prevent them from dispersing, transferring, or destroying it. The person in charge of the Wuhan International Trade Commercial Association expressed full support for the Government Administration Council's measures to prevent U.S. imperialism from engaging in economic sabotage within our country. Zhou Liu, manager of the Hankou Branch of Dachenghang, was extremely excited after seeing the order of the Government Administration Council. He believed that this was a powerful response from the new China that would not allow U.S. imperialism to bully [us]. The person in charge of the Hubei Provincial People's Government Department of Culture and Education stated: The decision of the Government Administration Council on the policy of handling cultural education, relief agencies, and religious organizations that accept American subsidies is a necessary step to eliminate American imperialist cultural aggression in China, and we will resolutely implement it. Huang Jianyuan, the person in charge of the Student Union of Huazhong University in Wuchang, which is sponsored by the American Church, said: "Our school is launching a movement to oppose the slander of U.S. imperialism and to accuse U.S. imperialism of its crimes of aggression. We support the government's measures and will strengthen our studies to eradicate pro-American ideas." All faculty, staff, and students of Wenhua Middle School issued a letter of determination stating: The decision of the Government Administration Council fully meets the ardent wishes of every patriotic teacher and student in church schools. We must sever economic ties with U.S. imperialism and become a truly Chinese people's school.
    The principals of 13 universities and middle schools in Fuzhou that accept American subsidies, such as Fukien Christian University and Hwa Nan Women's College, held a symposium and unanimously expressed their support for and compliance with the decision of the Government Administration Council. The students of Hwa Nan Women's College excitedly stated: We must cooperate well with the school authorities in carrying out all relevant work. The Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, the China Democratic League, the China National Democratic Construction Association, and the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party in Zhejiang Province and Hangzhou Municipality all issued written statements, unanimously believing that the decision of the Government Administration Council is a wise and decisive measure and the best way to sever the influence of American imperialist economic and cultural aggression. All democratic parties will work hard to assist the government in implementing the decision. People's organizations in Zhejiang Province and Hangzhou Municipality have issued statements expressing their full support for the government's decision and have decided to mobilize members of each organization to carry out extensive and in-depth publicity to the broad masses of people.
    Qiu Jinling, president of the Hangzhou Christian Council, stated: We Christians should correctly understand the truth, sever all ties with U.S. imperialism, and implement the self-government, self-support, and self-propagation of the Chinese people's self-run church reform program.
