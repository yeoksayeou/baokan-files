Heilongjiang Province Winter School Experience
    Sun Xi
    Editor's Note: This article is an abstract of a contribution from Comrade Sun Xi of the Heilongjiang Provincial Department of Education. The various issues raised in the article are quite common to winter schools across the country. We hope that various localities will promptly inform this newspaper of their relatively mature experiences in effectively solving these problems, so as to exchange experiences in this area.
    General Situation
    This year's winter school in Heilongjiang Province has been arranged earlier, based on the experience of the past two winters and one year of literacy campaigns. Because the masses have a better understanding of cultural learning, young farmers are very enthusiastic about attending winter school. Cadres generally have also made preparations ideologically. For example, in Qing'an and Tailai counties, district cultural and educational assistants and central school principals' meetings were held in early October to arrange the work. Some villages had long prepared winter school housing and fuel and found teachers. Sun Peiren, a member of the former house regiment in Shijia Village, Tailai, donated his family's large pot to the winter school for use as a stove; Huang Peilong brushed the walls of the winter school classroom with his bare shoulders, saying happily, "Chairman Mao told us to achieve cultural emancipation, why shouldn't we do it?" The winter school in Zhu Jiatun lacked desks and benches, so the members and cadres displayed their creativity by building earthen platforms with adobe and brushing them with white ash, arranging them neatly. Therefore, on the basis of the 1949 winter school and the 1950 regular literacy campaign, it is objectively possible to strive for 800,000 students to participate in winter school learning this year.
    Around mid-November last year, the province trained 9,055 teachers in district units (a few in village units) over a period of five to seven days (according to statistics from 28 counties). The training content was to study the winter school textbooks and how to master the teaching materials and teaching methods, exchange experiences, observe teaching, and study how to carry out winter school work in the future. Some districts also conducted model work awards, and focused on studying current affairs and political education on resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea to protect our homes and defend our country, so that teachers recognized the importance of winter school and the glory of being a teacher, and universally improved their teaching methods and teaching confidence.
    As of December 20, according to incomplete statistics from 32 counties, 8,617 civilian schools and 5,687 study groups have been opened, with 410,331 students enrolled.
    Imbalances and Their Main Causes
    However, on the other hand, due to the different specific conditions of each county, the development of winter school work varies from place to place. For example, Tailai, Zhaoyuan, and Zhaozhou counties only completed 74.6% of the original plan; while Hailun and Longjiang counties only completed 12.6% of the original plan. The main reasons for this imbalance are as follows: First, some county and district leading cadres, especially some educational administrative cadres, do not have sufficient understanding of the importance of rural winter schools, and do not regard winter school work as one of the important tasks. They believe that it does not matter if this work is not done, or that winter school already has a foundation, so leadership is not necessary; at the same time, they do not have sufficient understanding of the necessity and importance of combining winter school with central work, so they lack due effort in their subjectivity. For example, the masses in Wucun, Erqu, Zhaodong County, requested to attend winter school, but the village winter school committee ignored them. The civilian teachers were afraid that the winter school would not be able to open, so they went to the village head, but the village head said, "Winter school is a matter for the school, the village doesn't care." This shows that the masses' understanding of the meaning of winter school is very insufficient. It also shows that the mobilization work was done very poorly. According to past experience, as long as the students' minds are opened up in advance through in-depth propaganda and mobilization, and the masses' consciousness is enlightened, everything will be easy to handle. Second, some winter school leaders do not have enough understanding of the importance of the masses' conscious voluntariness. Many village cadres have a purely task-oriented view. They did not conduct in-depth mobilization of the masses beforehand, patiently explain the significance of winter school, and enlighten the masses' consciousness. For example, in Tonghe Village, Sanqu, Qing'an County, at the winter school meeting, the principal said that participation in learning was voluntary, and some women said, "We knew it was voluntary, we wouldn't have come early!" This shows that the masses' understanding of the significance of winter school is very insufficient. It also shows that the mobilization work was done very poorly. According to past experience, as long as the students' minds are opened up in advance through in-depth propaganda and mobilization, and the masses' consciousness is enlightened, everything will be easy to handle. Third, although winter school has started for more than a month, the educational administrative departments of many counties and districts have not yet properly established regular work. The winter school committee's organization is not sound, and the relevant departments have not cooperated well. In terms of leadership methods, there is more arrangement than inspection, and very little research work is done. The village-level leadership lacks a clear division of labor. Most districts and villages have formed a situation in which the central school principal and township primary school teachers are performing solo shows.
    How to Overcome Shortcomings?
    In order to overcome the above-mentioned shortcomings, the following issues must be resolved in the future:
    First of all, we must continue to open up the minds of cadres at the county, district, township, and village levels, so that they thoroughly understand the great significance of worker-peasant education in political, economic, and cultural aspects, recognize that the literacy movement is the primary step for the broad masses of peasants to achieve cultural emancipation, and recognize that improving the cultural level of workers and peasants is an important condition for improving their political, ideological, and professional levels. At the same time, leading comrades must clearly recognize that to carry out the winter school movement, it is necessary to enlighten the masses' conscious voluntariness and combine literacy education with the masses' production, current affairs education, and central work, etc., according to the actual needs of the masses. For example, in Gongping Village, Beixing District, Keshan County, because this year suffered from severe drought and floods, the masses urgently demanded to engage in sideline occupations. The county cultural and educational department followed the principle of mass voluntariness and used study groups as sideline occupation groups. Now more than 80% of the illiterate people in the township have participated in learning, and they have issued a challenge to the entire district, promoting the entire district. The primary school teachers of Taian Sanqu compiled a supplementary textbook lesson, the content of which is: "Every family is busy threshing, every household is transporting public grain, sending good public grain, defending national defense; the volunteer army bravely crosses the river, U.S. imperialism will surely perish." Everyone learns and sings together, and is very happy. This also improves the masses' understanding of current affairs and politics, and is of great help to the completion of work tasks.
    Second, strengthen the three-level literacy committee, improve the leadership organization, carefully study the instructions from higher levels, formulate county, district, and village winter school plans, specifically arrange work, unify leadership, closely cooperate, and supervise and inspect. The municipal, county, and banner cultural and educational bureaus and cultural and educational sections should have special personnel responsible for leading the winter school. All organs, organizations, and schools should do their best to assist and establish core leadership (such as Tailai, Keshan, and Baicheng counties, which have done better in this regard). Special personnel should be responsible for the civilian schools, literacy classes, literacy groups, and even family and kang-head study groups in the winter school, and enthusiastic educators should be invited to participate. The leadership should conduct in-depth inspections, pay attention to cultivating typical examples, and summarize experiences at any time. The district-level leadership should overcome the tendency to ignore the work themselves and push the work to the central school principal. The county winter school committee should effectively assume leadership responsibility. On the basis of the masses' conscious voluntariness, systems such as leave, roll call, and examinations can be established. The leadership should be good at discovering problems, solving problems in a timely manner, and providing concrete assistance. The worker-peasant literacy communication compiled by the Keshan Cultural and Educational Section, the Anda Winter School Bulletin, and the literacy movement newspaper of Baicheng County are all very effective forms of written leadership, which can help the winter school to gradually improve, introduce experiences, cultivate typical examples, establish winter school banners, and drive the general. At the same time, timely and in-depth inspections must be carried out to avoid the winter school becoming uncontrolled.
    Regarding Civilian Teachers and Teaching Issues
    In order to further consolidate and improve the winter school, the issue of teachers and teaching is worth special attention.
    In carrying out the winter school movement, we should resolutely implement the principle of "the people teaching the people," because teachers selected from the masses are familiar with the masses' living habits and needs, and can patiently teach, making it easy for the masses to accept. However, their cultural level is low and they lack teaching experience. For example, in Baiquan and Jin counties, among the existing 904 teachers, 80% have only completed two years of schooling. Therefore, we should pay attention to cultivating and improving the teaching level of teachers. The methods of cultivation and improvement should start from three aspects: (1) Regular collective training. There are two ways to train: one is to conduct large-scale collective training in county or district units. This type of training can only be held twice a year (once before the start of winter school, and once after the end of winter school and before spring plowing to prepare to transfer the winter school to a long-term literacy movement); the other is to conduct small-scale, decentralized collective training in piece or village units. As for the time, in general, it can be used flexibly every ten days, half a month, or a month, according to needs. (2) Conduct timely guidance, hold investigation and research meetings, symposiums, and review meetings to improve them. For example, Comrade Yu Chunyuan, a primary school teacher in Qianwufangzi Village, Wuqu, Zhaoyuan, used the gap before breakfast to gather the winter school teachers and outstanding third and fourth grade students (ie, young teachers) in the village for learning. He raised the main content of the lecture that day for research. This gradually improved the teaching ability of the winter school teachers. (3) Help the winter school teachers summarize their work (but note that this is not to replace them). At the same time, we should give the winter school teachers honorary or material rewards or appropriate subsidies according to the specific circumstances to improve their teaching enthusiasm.
    In terms of teaching methods, we should conscientiously implement the principle of "learning and using are consistent," and at the same time grasp the educational characteristics of adults. Township primary school teachers, Party, League, and village cadres and winter school teachers should closely cooperate to solve the difficulties in teaching. Primary school teachers and Party, League, and village cadres should collectively study or organize teaching experience symposiums to exchange experiences and study the content of lectures. Primary school teachers or Party members and cadres should lecture on current affairs and politics, production knowledge, and civilian school textbooks. Labor heroes and production models can also be invited to give production classes to the winter school, or experienced labor models can be hired as full-time teachers. This is a method of "cadres teaching teachers" and "teachers teaching cadres" to learn from each other's strengths and make up for each other's weaknesses.
    Winter school must first meet the actual needs of the masses, so that the masses feel that winter school is helpful to them. For example, some students learn to calculate public grain accounts, issue slips, and look at tickets, which should be applied to actual life. But at the same time, students should also understand that literacy is not only for calculating accounts and issuing slips. It is best to use symposiums, discussions, and Q&A to conduct current affairs and political classes; don't be greedy when teaching cultural classes, but talk less and practice more. Being greedy will not be digested. In-class improvement should be closely combined with after-class review, and students should be encouraged to be diligent in three areas (diligent in asking, diligent in reciting, and diligent in writing). Teaching methods must be flexible and diverse. Concentrated civilian schools and decentralized groups cannot adopt the same teaching methods; sideline occupation groups and kang-head groups should sometimes be different. Teaching methods such as snowballing, passing water cards, young teachers sending words, small blackboards, mutual teaching and learning, object marking, and pictographic character splitting can all be used flexibly.
    Secondly, it is necessary to cultivate students' self-learning habits. Adults have poor memory and are prone to feel the difficulty of literacy, and even develop feelings of disappointment; therefore, various methods should be constantly adopted in teaching, such as periodic review of achievements, cultural accusations, and commendations, to improve their understanding of learning and further develop their thinking ability and spirit of inquiry, so that they develop self-learning habits. And call on "mutual teaching and learning." Home visits should be made to students who are learning poorly, and specific assistance should be provided; those with a certain level of education should pay attention to improving their self-learning ability and practicing application, such as helping them learn to use dictionaries and read popular books and newspapers to consolidate their literacy achievements.

　　黑龙江省冬学经验
    孙曦
    编者按：本文是黑龙江省文教厅孙曦同志来稿的摘要。文中所提各项问题，对全国各地冬学来说，是有相当普遍性的。希望各地把如何有效地解决这些问题的比较成熟的经验及时告诉本报，以便交流这一方面的经验。
    一般情况
    黑龙江省今年的冬学，根据过去两冬一年识字运动的经验，作了较早的布置。由于群众对文化学习有了认识，青年农民要求上冬学的情绪很高。干部思想上一般地也都有了准备。如庆安、泰来等县，在十月上旬即召开区文教助理和中心校长会议，布置工作。而某些村的群众则老早就把冬学房舍、燃料准备好了，并物色了教员。泰来石家村前地房子团员孙培仁，把自己家大锅献给冬学作炉子用；黄培龙光着大膀子刷冬学教室的墙，他高兴的说：“毛主席叫咱们文化翻身，为啥还不干呢？”朱家屯冬学没有桌凳，团员和干部发挥了创造性，用坯搭成土台子，再用白灰一刷，布置得整整齐齐的。因此，在一九四九年冬学和一九五○年常年识字运动的基础上，要求今年冬学争取达到八十万学员参加冬学学习，是有客观条件的。
    全省在去年十一月中旬前后，以区（少数以村）为单位，在五天至七天的时间内集训了九千零五十五名教员（根据二十八个县的统计）。集训内容是研究冬学课本及如何掌握教材和教学方法，交流经验，观摩教学，并研究今后如何开展冬学工作。有的区并进行了奖励模范工作，又着重研究了抗美援朝保家卫国的时事政治教育，使教员们认识了冬学的重要和当教员的光荣，普遍提高了教员的教学方法和教学信心。
    截至十二月二十日，根据三十二个县的不完全统计，已开办民校八千六百十七处，学习小组五千六百八十七个，入学人数四十一万零三百三十一人。
    不平衡现象及其主要原因
    但在另一方面，由于各县的具体情况不同，各地冬学工作的开展是不平衡的，如泰来、肇源、肇州三县，只完成原计划的百分之七四·六；而海伦、龙江二县只完成原计划的百分之一二·六。这种不平衡现象的主要原因如下：第一，有的县区领导干部，特别是有的教育行政干部，对农村冬学的重要性认识不足，没有把冬学工作看作重要工作之一。他们认为这一工作不搞也不要紧，或者认为冬学已有了基础，不领导也没关系；同时对冬学和中心工作相结合的必要性和重要性认识不足，因此在主观上缺乏应有的努力。例如肇东二区五村群众要求上冬学，而村冬学委员会置之不理。民师怕冬学办不起来，去找村长，但村长说：“冬学是学校的事，村上不管。”第二，有些地方的冬学领导人对群众自觉自愿的重要性认识不够。不少村干部有单纯任务的观点。事前没有对群众作深入的动员，耐心解释冬学的意义，启发群众的自觉。如庆安县三区同和村，在冬学会议上，校长说参加学习是自愿的，有的妇女便说：“我们知道是自愿，早不来啦！”这说明了群众对冬学意义的认识非常不够。也说明了动员工作做得很差。根据过去的经验，只要事前打通学员思想，深入的宣传动员，使群众开了脑筋，什么事都好办。第三，冬学虽然已开始了一个多月，但不少县区教育行政部门，至今仍未适当的建立经常性工作。冬学委员会的机构不健全，各有关部门未能很好地配合。在领导方法上，布置多于检查，研究工作做得很少。村级领导机构缺乏明确分工。大部分区村形成中心校长和乡小教师唱独脚戏的现象。
    怎样克服缺点？
    为了克服上述的缺点，今后必须解决下列几个问题：
    首先必须继续打通县、区、乡、村等级干部思想，使他们彻底认识工农教育在政治、经济、文化各方面的重大意义，认识识字运动是使广大农民在文化上翻身的首要步骤，认识提高工农文化水平，乃是提高他们的政治水平、思想水平、业务水平的重要条件。同时领导同志必须明确认识：开展冬学运动，必须启发群众的自觉自愿，根据群众的实际要求，把识字教育与群众生产、时事教育和中心工作等结合起来。如克山县北兴区公平村，因今年遭受了严重的旱灾和水灾，群众迫切地要求搞副业。县文教科就按照群众自愿的原则，以学习小组为副业小组。现全乡有百分之八十以上的文盲参加了学习，并发出了挑战书，向全区挑战，推动了全区。泰安三区小学教员编了一课补充教材，内容是：“家家忙打场，户户挑公粮，送好公粮，保卫国防；志愿部队英勇过江，美帝国主义必定灭亡。”大家连学带唱，十分高兴。这样也就提高了群众对时事政治的认识，对工作任务的完成，也有很大的帮助。
    第二，加强三级识字委员会，健全领导机构，仔细研究上级的指示，制订县、区、村的冬学计划，具体布置工作，统一领导，密切配合，督促检查。市、县、旗文教局和文教科应有专人负责领导冬学。各机关团体、学校应尽力协助，建立核心领导（如泰来、克山、白城等县在这方面做得较好）。对冬学中的民校、识字班、识字组、甚至家庭、炕头学习组等，都要有专人负责，并邀请热心教育的人士参加。领导上要深入检查，注意培养典型，随时总结经验。区一级领导应克服自己不管、把工作推给中心校长的偏向，县冬学委员会要切实负起领导责任。在群众自觉自愿的基础上可以建立请假、点名、考试等制度。领导上要善于发现问题，及时的解决问题，并给以具体帮助。像克山文教科编写的工农识字通讯，安达冬学快报和白城县的识字运动小报，都是很有效的文字领导形式，可以帮助冬学逐步提高，介绍经验，培养典型，树立冬学旗帜，带动一般。同时必须及时深入检查，避免冬学形成自流。
    关于民师和教学问题
    为使冬学进一步巩固与提高，教员与教学问题是值得特别重视的。
    开展冬学运动，应坚决贯彻“以民教民”的方针，因为由群众中选出的教员，熟悉群众的生活习惯与需要，并能耐心教学，使群众易于接受。但他们文化水平低，缺乏教学经验。如拜泉、金县在现有九百零四名教员中，念过二年书的竟占百分之八十。因此，我们要注意培养提高教员的教学水平。培养与提高的办法，应从三方面着手：（一）定期集训。训练的方式有二种：一种是以县或区为单位，大规模地集训。这种集训，一年只能有两次（一次是冬学开始前，一次是在冬学结束后、春耕生产前准备将冬学转入长期识字运动时）；一种是以片或村为单位，进行小型的分散集训。至于时间，一般的说，隔十天、半月或一个月，可根据需要灵活运用。（二）及时进行辅导，召开调查研究会、座谈会和检讨会，以提高他们。如肇源五区前五房子村乡小学教员于春元同志，利用早饭前的空隙，召集该村冬学教员和三、四年级优秀生（即小先生）进行学习。他把当天讲课的主要内容，提出来研究。这样就逐渐提高了冬学教员的教学能力。（三）帮助冬学教员总结工作（但要注意这不是代替）。同时应根据具体情况，给冬学教员以名誉或物质的奖励或适当的补助，以提高冬学教员的教学热诚。
    在教学方法方面，应切实贯彻“学用一致”的原则，同时掌握成人的教育特点。乡小学教员，党、团、村干部和冬学教员应密切配合解决教学中的困难。小学教员和党、团、村干部要集体学习或组织教学经验座谈会，交流经验，研究讲课内容，由小学教员或党员干部讲时事政治、生产常识和民校课本。还可以请劳动英雄和生产模范给冬学讲生产课，或聘请有生产经验的劳模当专任教员。这是“干部教教员”，“教员教干部”的取长补短的办法。
    冬学首先要满足群众的实际需要，使群众觉得冬学对自己有帮助。如有的学员学了算公粮账、开条子、看票子，就应用到实际生活中去。但同时也要使学员们了解：识字不仅仅为了算帐，开条子等。讲时事政治课，最好用座谈、讨论、问答等方式来进行；讲文化课不要贪多，要少讲多练。贪多就嚼不烂。课内提高要与课外复习密切结合，对学员学习提倡三勤（勤问、勤念、勤写）。教学方法必须灵活和多样化。集中的民校和分散的小组，就不能采取同样的教学方法；副业小组、炕头小组有时也应有所区别，如滚雪球，传水牌，小先生送字，小黑板，互教互学，实物标字，象形拆字等教学方法，全可灵活使用。
    其次，要培养学员的自学习惯。成人的记忆力较差，容易感到识字的困难，甚至产生失望的情绪；所以在教学中应不断采用各种办法，如定期回忆成绩、文化诉苦、表扬等，以提高其对学习的认识，进一步发挥他们的思考能力和钻研精神，使其养成自学习惯。并号召“互教互学”。对学习较差的同学，应作家庭访问，具体进行帮助；对有一定文化水平的人应注意提高其自学能力，练习应用，如帮助其学会查字典，阅读通俗书报等，以巩固识字的成绩。
