Xinhua News Agency, January 27th: To ensure traffic safety, the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government has decided to promote the Model Road Maintenance Team Movement in the northern and southern railways this year and has announced the "Measures for Establishing Model Road Maintenance Teams in Northern and Southern Railways." The National Railway Workers' Union has also notified its affiliated unions at all levels to ensure the promotion of the movement. The Model Road Maintenance Team Movement draws on the experience of the "Iron Ox" movement in the Northeast railways and is another patriotic competition that complements the Model Locomotive Team movement. The measures stipulate that road maintenance work areas and road maintenance foreman areas that meet certain standards can be approved as probationary, formal, and backbone members. Outstanding work performance after joining the team will be rewarded.

Before liberation, China's railways had been in disrepair for years. Most of the ballast and sleepers were buried in the soil, some sleepers were even rotten, and weeds grew all over the roadbed, resulting in low traffic efficiency and easy occurrence of engineering accidents. After liberation, railway workers in various places launched road maintenance movements. Later, the engineering departments learned the Soviet system of responsibility for road maintenance and implemented the new road maintenance method. As a result, by the end of last year, more than 20,000 kilometers of railways across the country had been given a new look.

    铁道部公布北方、南方铁路建立模范养路队办法
    【新华社二十七日讯】为保证行车安全，中央人民政府铁道部决定今年在北方和南方铁路推行模范养路队运动，并公布了“在北方、南方铁路建立模范养路队办法”。铁路总工会也已通知所属各级工会保证运动的推行。模范养路队运动吸取了东北铁路铁牛运动的经验，是配合着模范机车队运动的又一个爱国主义竞赛。办法中规定，凡养路工作达到一定标准的养路工区和养路领工区都可被批准为预备、正式、基干队员。入队后工作成绩卓越，可以得到奖励。
    我国铁路线路在解放前年久失修，大部石碴和枕木被土埋住，甚至枕木腐朽，道床生满荒草，以致行车效率很低，还易发生工务事故。解放后各地铁路工人纷纷展开养路运动，后来工务部门又学习了苏联的养路负责制，实行新养路法，因此到去年年底止全国二万多公里铁路已换了一个新面貌。
