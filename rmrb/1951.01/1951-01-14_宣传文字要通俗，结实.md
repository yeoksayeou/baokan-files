　　Propaganda Writing Should Be Popular and Solid
    Lao She
    Our Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda movement has achieved good results in just over a month. The sheer number of propaganda works is truly astonishing and exciting. This is because everyone regards this work not only as a temporary task, but uses patriotic enthusiasm to turn the work into a sincere expression of defending the country and protecting the home. In this situation, I would like to refrain from praising too much here, but rather point out some shortcomings that I can see, in the hope that everyone will make this work more in-depth and solid. I think our:
    (1) Writing still lacks popular appeal: According to what I have seen and heard, I feel that our propaganda language, whether in writing or orally, still lacks popular appeal. The problem is probably that everyone only swallows the materials and vocabulary from newspapers and periodicals raw, and then says them as they are, without digesting them. A noun often carries a small group of meanings. If we can use the language of the masses, concrete facts, and clear images to express that small group of meanings, we will give the masses something they should know. Conversely, if we only pile up "warmongers," "flames of anger," "Wall Street spokespersons," etc., and shout them out, we will not be able to teach the masses anything, and the propaganda work will not achieve much effect. Recently, everyone has been enthusiastic about writing propaganda texts, which is gratifying. However, although there are many works, few are outstanding. This is also because everyone only "broadcasts" the materials and terms from newspapers and periodicals, without carefully chewing and digesting them, turning the literary into the popular, turning the principles into concrete explanations, and turning the food into milk, so it is inevitable that they are all the same and lack the power to move people. The "flames of anger" will not move ordinary people unless we ponder and ponder again and turn it into the language of the common people.
    (2) When we do propaganda, we often only care about saying what we want to say, without thinking carefully about what the masses want to hear and need to hear. This is because we do not understand the people enough, so the people inevitably feel a little out of sync when they hear what we say. Some young friends complained to me: they have never been to America or Korea, so what can they write? In fact, if we can go to the people, we can discover many problems, and then prescribe the right medicine for the disease, and we will have good articles. Also, today because we have not put in enough effort among the people, we can only shout some anti-American slogans (of course, slogans are also useful); if we can understand our people more, we can immediately move from empty slogans to actively praising our own virtues and strengths, and increase our confidence in resisting America and our enthusiasm for defending our country and protecting our homes. For example: even our elementary school students save pocket money to prepare comfort bags; our workers unanimously increase production to support the front; our friends in the business community also establish mutual agreements and unite to love the country; our...aren't these worth praising? Wouldn't it have a good effect if written out? We don't have to go to America to write anti-American texts; writing about our own patriotic spirit and facts is more intimate and powerful. For in-depth propaganda, we should work in groups; you go to Tianqiao, they go to the factory, we contact the business community, conduct investigations, and discussions, and then everyone starts writing solid propaganda works. If we don't do this, but always do superficial advocacy, it will definitely not be outstanding; and if we keep writing, we may lose heart because there is nothing more to write. Facts speak louder than words. We have many concrete expressions and facts of patriotism. Why don't we divide the work in a systematic way to write about them? If we can divide the work in a systematic way to investigate, research, and create, what we write will not be generally the same, and we will gradually approach "in-depth."

### 宣传文字要通俗，结实

　　宣传文字要通俗，结实
    老舍
    我们的抗美援朝宣传运动，在短短的一个多月中，已收到了很好的效果。宣传作品之多，真足使人惊异、兴奋。这是因为大家对这次的工作，不仅视为临时的任务，而是用爱国的热诚，把工作变为保家卫国的真诚的表现。在这情形下，我愿在这里不再多夸赞，而愿由我所能见到的指出一些缺点，以期大家把这工作做得更深入，更结实。我以为，我们的：
    （一）文字还欠通俗：据我所看到听到的，我觉得无论在文字上，还是口头上，我们的宣传用语还都欠通俗。毛病恐怕是在大家只把报纸和刊物上的资料与词汇，生吞下去，而后照样说出来，并未曾把它们消化了。一个名词后面，往往带着一小群意义。假若我们能把那一小群意义，用大众的语言，用具体的事实，用明确的形象，说道出来，我们才会给大众一些应当知道的东西。反之，我们若只把“战争贩子”，“愤怒的火焰”，“华尔街的代言人”等等堆砌在一处，叫喊出来，我们便不能教大众明白什么，而宣传工作也就收不到多大的效果。近来，大家都热心写宣传文字，这是值得高兴的事。可是，作品虽不少，突出的并不多见。这也是因为大家只“转播”了报纸上刊物上的资料与用语，而没细细咀嚼，细细消化，把文的变成俗的，把道理变成具体的说明，把食料变为乳汁，所以难免千篇一律，没有感人的力量。“愤怒的火焰”不会感动一般的人，除非我们揣磨再揣磨，将它变成老百姓的语言。
    （二）我们作宣传，往往只顾说我们的话，而没细想大众愿意听什么，和需要听什么。这是因为我们对人民了解不够，因此，人民听了我们的话，难免有点格格不入。有些青年朋友向我诉苦：既没到过美国，又没到过朝鲜，可写什么呢？其实，我们若能到民间去，我们便能发现许多问题，而后对病下药，就有了好文章。还有，今天因为我们没在民间下工夫，所以只能喊些反美的口号（当然，口号也有用处）；假若我们能多了解我们的人民，我们便马上能由空洞的喊口号，走到积极的表扬我们自己的美德，力量，而增高了抗美的自信心，与卫国保家的热情。比如说：连我们小学校的学生也节省零钱，去置办慰劳袋；我们的工人一致的以增加生产，支援前方；我们的商界朋友，也互立公约，齐心爱国；我们的……这些，难道不值得表扬么？难道写出来没有好效果么？我们不必到过美国才能写反美的文字，写我们自己的爱国精神与事实更亲切有力。为深入宣传，我们应当分组去搞，你们上天桥，他们到工厂，我们联系商界，作调查，作讨论，而后大家动手写结结实实的宣传作品。不这样，而老去作浮面皮儿的鼓吹，一定不会出色；而且写来写去，也许就因再没有可写的而泄了气。事实胜于雄辩，我们有不少爱国的具体表现与事实，为什么不分工的，有系统的，去写呢？能分工的，有系统的，去调查，研究，与创作，我们写出来的东西便不泛泛的千篇一律，也就是渐次接近“深入”。
