To the Editor:
	In the past six months, a small number of district and village cadres (Party members), and even individual county-level cadres, in our county have developed a negative retirement ideology. They put their personal future in opposition to the future of the revolution, and are eager to return home. As a result, their work enthusiasm is not high, which greatly affects the work, and some even refuse to work after returning home. Some places have adopted education methods to address this; others have adopted organizational disciplinary measures. Which method is correct? Please answer.

Comrade Li Deshan:
	It is true that a small number of rural cadres and Party members currently have this negative retirement ideology. It has seriously affected the various tasks of the Party and the government. However, this ideology can be changed by strengthening education for these cadres; and it can be confidently said that many of these Party members and cadres, after education, can meet the standards required by our Party and become good cadres.

	In the nearly thirty years of revolutionary struggle, Chinese peasants, due to the severe oppression of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, have developed strong anti-imperialist, anti-feudalist, and anti-bureaucratic thoughts and demands. Therefore, they actively participated in the revolutionary struggle in various periods, and a portion of the advanced elements joined the Communist Party. These Party members have proven in the long revolutionary struggle of the past to be loyal to the cause of the Party. However, some of them still have some serious shortcomings, especially in the transformation of their own ideological consciousness, and they still retain the ideological consciousness of their original class. At the same time, because the Party was in a tense wartime environment for a long time in the past, it did not provide systematic education, so some Party members have not fully established a communist worldview. Some therefore regard defeating Japanese imperialism, defeating Chiang Kai-shek, and dividing the land as the ultimate goals of the revolution, and do not see or do not believe that there will be a better communist society in the future. Some regard the agricultural socialist ideas of peasants "eating from the big pot" and "equal division of land" as communism. Therefore, after Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionary ruling class were overthrown, the land reform was completed, and they were divided "land, houses, large castrated oxen," etc., they wanted to "go home to be the boss and no longer be a hired hand (referring to serving the people)," and began to develop a negative retirement ideology that ran counter to the revolutionary cause.

	On the other hand, it is also because these Party member cadres have low cultural levels, weak abilities, and indeed many difficulties in their work; coupled with the fact that superiors assign too many tasks, provide too little help, and even some tasks are not in line with the actual situation and are difficult to complete. Therefore, they feel so-called "suffering from all sides," that is, "failing to complete the task makes the superiors angry, forcing the execution of the task makes the masses angry, and delaying production makes the family angry." As a result, their morale is ruined, the retirement ideology is further developed, and they firmly demand to go home.

	In some leading organs, a small number of Party member cadres from peasant backgrounds have also begun to be tempted by material enjoyment, and want the leadership to help solve their family problems and wife problems. When these problems cannot be solved; or are not solved as well as they would like, they become "angry" and say: "We have ‘merit’ even if we don’t have ‘credit’, and we have ‘toil’ even if we don’t have ‘hard work’! Why is the revolution so ‘cruel’ to us?!" Therefore, they demand to go home and solve these problems themselves. Some even individually become "deserters" from the revolutionary ranks.

	Of course, the Party absolutely does not allow this kind of erroneous thinking to exist within the Party and allow it to develop. But on the other hand, the occurrence of this erroneous thinking is indeed because these Party members still have the ideological consciousness of their original class, and the Party lacks systematic communist education for these people. Therefore, to overcome these Party members' erroneous thinking, the most important method should be to strengthen education for them, help them establish a correct communist worldview, and be loyal to the cause of the Party and the people. This rectification movement has proven in a few areas that this educational method is correct; therefore, many Party members and cadres are working hard again, just like before.

	The education method should first strengthen cultural education. In the past, one of the reasons why these comrades were slow to accept new things was that their cultural level was low. Therefore, raising the cultural level of these Party members has become a prerequisite for improving their political level and work ability. Some counties and districts have now added cultural teachers, or opened workers' and peasants' cadre quick-success middle schools to improve the cultural level of these Party member cadres; and have achieved great results. At the same time, methods such as mutual assistance learning can also be used to improve their cultural level.

	Local Party committees should also conduct basic knowledge education for these Party members in a planned and step-by-step manner. Some Party committees have opened Party member training classes and take turns training rural Party member cadres. This is correct and should continue.

	Current affairs education is also one of the necessary educations. It must be explained to everyone that the revolution has not yet succeeded and the struggle is still fierce. When American imperialism is frantically invading, and landlords and special agents are also cooperating with American imperialism's attacks internally by spreading rumors and sabotaging, how can we "retire and enjoy happiness?!" Everyone must strive to transform their thinking and fight for the revolutionary cause to the end. This will transform their thinking that the revolution has succeeded. There are such facts in Shanxi and Hebei: after this current affairs education on resisting America and aiding Korea, some Party member cadres who originally had negative retirement ideas are now able to work actively. They said: "We cannot let American imperialism, the Kuomintang reactionaries, and the reactionary landlords replace our team."

	In addition, leading organs at all levels should promptly help everyone summarize the correct parts of the past work and criticize the erroneous parts of the work, and the leadership should bravely shoulder its own responsibilities. They should also constantly educate everyone on the mass line, so that everyone can realize that the mass line is the Party's line, the class line, the revolutionary line, and the fundamental method of revolutionary work. This can be done by comparing good and bad typical facts for education. As for the living difficulties of some people, they should be taken care of within the scope allowed by the system, and should not be ignored. If some difficulties are indeed impossible to solve, the leading organs should make a decision after formal discussion, such as individually approving them to return to their hometowns to work.

	However, after education, there may still be a small number of people who insist on retiring and returning home. At this time, the Party has fulfilled its responsibilities, and it can be removed from the Party by a vote of the general membership meeting of the branch to which he belongs, in accordance with the provisions of Article 11 of the Party Constitution, and reported to the higher Party committee. At the same time, he should be notified that after retiring and returning home, he should abide by the policies and laws of the People's Government, work hard in labor production, and be a good citizen of the new China.

### 怎样解决退休思想？

　　怎样解决退休思想？编辑同志：
    近半年来，我们县里有一小部分区、村干部（党员），甚至个别县级干部，都产生了一种消极退休的思想。他们把个人前途和革命前途对立起来，迫切要求回家。因此他们的工作情绪不高，影响工作很大，甚至有些回家后不出来工作了。有些地方对此采取教育的方法；有些地方采取组织处分的方法，究竟那个方法对？请你答复。
                                   李德山李德山同志：
    目前确实有一小部分农村干部党员存在着这种消极退休思想。并已严重地影响到党与政府的各种工作。但是这种思想是可以从加强对这些干部的教育来改变的；而且可以肯定地说，其中有很多党员干部经过教育之后，是可以达到我们党所要求的标准，成为很好的干部。
    在将近三十年的革命斗争中，中国农民，由于遭受帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的严重的压迫，有了强烈的反帝反封建反官僚资本的思想与要求。因此，他们在革命斗争的各个时期，主动地积极地参加了革命斗争，并有一部分先进分子参加了共产党。这些党员已经在以往长期革命斗争中证明了是忠实于党的事业的。但是其中也确有一部分党员至今还存在一些较严重的缺点，特别是对于自己思想意识的改造很不够，还保留着他们原来阶级的思想意识。同时由于党过去长期处在紧张的战争环境中，没有给以系统的教育，以致有些党员还没有完全树立共产主义的人生观。有的因此把打倒日本帝国主义，打倒蒋介石，分得土地，当作了革命的最终目的，而看不见或者是不相信将来还会有更美好的共产主义社会。有的把农民“吃大锅饭”、“平分土地”的农业社会主义思想当成了共产主义。所以这些人在日本帝国主义与国民党反动统治阶级被打倒，土地改革已完成，自己分得了“土地、房屋、大犍牛”等等之后，就想“回家当掌柜，不再做长工（指为人民服务）”，开始滋长了一种与革命事业背道而驰的消极退休思想。
    另一方面，也因为这些党员干部文化低，能力弱，工作中的困难确实很多；又加上级布置任务多，帮助少，甚至有些任务不切合实际情况，难以完成。因此使他们感到所谓“三面受气”，即“完不成任务受上级的气，强迫执行任务受群众的气，耽误了生产受家庭的气”。于是他们情绪败坏，退休思想更加发展，坚决要求回家。
    在某些领导机关中，也有少数出身于农民的党员干部开始受到物质享受的引诱，而要领导上帮助解决他们家庭问题以及老婆问题。当这些问题不能解决时；或解决得不如他们理想时，他们就“愤怒”，就说：“我们没有‘功劳’也有‘苦劳’，没有‘苦劳’也有‘疲劳’！为什么革命对我们这样‘残酷’？！”因此他们要求回家，自己来解决这些问题。甚至个别地成了革命队伍的“逃兵”。
    当然党是绝对不允许这种错误思想存在党内，并让其发展的。但是另一方面，这种错误思想的发生，确实是因为这些党员还存在着原来阶级的思想意识，党对这些人缺乏系统的共产主义教育所致。所以，要克服这些党员的错误的思想，最主要的方法就应当是加强对他们的教育，帮助他们树立起正确的共产主义人生观，忠实于党的、人民的事业。这次整风中已在少数地区证明这种教育方法是正确的；因此有很多党员干部，又如从前一样地努力工作。
    教育方法，首先要加强文化教育。过去这些同志所以接受新事物迟缓，文化水平低不能不是原因之一。因此对这些党员提高文化水平已成为提高政治水平与工作能力的先决条件。现在已有些县、区添设了文化教员，或开办工农干部速成中学来提高这些党员干部的文化水平；取得了很大成绩。同时还可以采用互助学习等办法来提高他们的文化水平。
    各地党委还应当有计划地有步骤地对这些党员进行党的基本知识教育。有些党委已开办党员训练班，轮流训练农村党员干部。这是正确的，应该继续下去。
    时事教育也是必须进行的教育之一。必须对大家说明革命还没有成功，斗争仍然还是激烈的。当着美帝国主义疯狂侵略，地主、特务也在内部配合美帝国主义的进攻造谣、破坏的时候，我们怎么能够“退休享福”呢？！大家一定要奋发改造自己思想，为革命事业奋斗到底。这样就能转变他们的革命成功思想。山西河北就有这样的事实：经过这次抗美援朝的时事教育之后，有些原来有消极退休思想的党员干部，现在已能积极地工作。他们说：“我们不能让美帝国主义、国民党反动派和反动地主来换咱们的班子。”
    此外，各级领导机关还应该及时地帮助大家总结过去工作中正确的部分和批判工作中的错误部分，领导上并应勇敢地担负起自己应负的责任。并要不断地，对大家进行群众路线的教育，使大家认识到群众路线就是党的路线，阶级的路线，革命的路线，革命工作的根本方法。这可以采用好坏典型事实对比的方法来进行教育。至于某些人生活上的困难，应在制度允许的范围内予以照顾，不应漠不关心。有些困难确实无法解决的，领导机关就应经过正式讨论，做出决定，如个别批准回乡工作等。
    但是经过教育之后，可能还有一小部分人，坚持退休回家。这时党已尽了自己的责任，就可以按照党章十一条的规定，由他本人所属的支部大会通过除名，并报告上级党委。同时通知他本人，在退休回家以后，应遵守人民政府的政策法令，努力劳动生产，作一个新中国的好公民。
