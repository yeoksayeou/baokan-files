　　The Train is Moving
    Dù Gāo
    The white distant mountains and roadside slopes recede rapidly, and the cold wind carrying snow powder drills in through the cracks in the car window, with snowflakes dancing outside the window.
    The train is galloping, racing across the land of Korea.
    Many people who have never met each other are here, so closely together. These people, who once lived different lives, are gathered together on the train, in the snowy mountain gullies, with one wish. Here, everyone becomes a comrade; here, everyone walks the same road forward; only here are lives so tightly connected, relying on each other.
    This carriage is packed with no less than sixty people, young lads and middle-aged men, some smoking, some chatting, some dozing, and some humming their favorite tunes softly. In everyone's heart, there is a kind of elusive emotion, but a common passion inspired by the ideal of victory unites everyone together.
    These people once lived peaceful lives; these people grew up on Chinese soil and have now become armed volunteer soldiers.
    To my right is a member of a stretcher team, a farmer from the fields. He looks to be in his thirties, with a square face, dark and bright eyes, thick eyebrows, a thick nose rising and falling silently, and some wrinkles etched on his forehead. He holds his pipe tightly and smokes it vigorously, even though the tobacco tastes very spicy.
    He was the first to speak to me: "Have you been to Korea before?"
    "No, this is my first time."
    "This is also my first time away from home. I used to farm in the fields, working day after day, but I never thought I would go abroad." He narrowed his eyes and chuckled.
    "Do you have any family at home?"
    "Yes, a wife and two sons..."
    "Are they happy that you joined the army?"
    "Hmm!" He was obviously not happy with my question, turned to look at me, and kept spitting smoke out of his mouth. "What's not to be happy about? I volunteered to join the army, and they are even hoping that I'll come home with a big flag!"
    I fell silent, listening quietly to his voice.
    "This time Korea is suffering from the American devils, it's like our neighbor's house is on fire, and sparks are landing on our house, how can I not help put out the fire? ... Everyone in our area has suffered from the Japanese devils. The Communist Party finally helped us build our houses and distributed land, and I even got a head of livestock. This year is another bumper year!"
    "Yes, the poor have land, and they work harder!"
    "This year, I plan to add another head of livestock and buy a cart... We farmers cherish this land and can't let the American devils come and ruin it again..." He spat on the ground with a "thump."
    "Comrade, are there many volunteers in your area?"
    "Don't even mention it, I offended Zhou's second son because of this. Everyone in our area is scrambling to join the Volunteer Army, and Zhou's second son wanted to squeeze me out, but that's not going to happen... It's hard to say, he's worked as a beast of burden for the devils before..." After a while, he suddenly said in a low but very serious voice: "This time, I don't want anything else, I just want two things..."
    "What are they?"
    "This time, I must strive to join the Party! And I have to take a gun home!"
    His eyes shone brightly, gazing at the flickering candlelight.
    I took his dry tobacco pipe and started smoking like him.
    Sitting to my left was a young comrade who looked no more than twenty-four or five years old, with quite delicate features. He told me that he was an opera actor, and he had had good success on the stage. He had performed the famous operas "The White Haired Girl" and "Blood and Tears." He said that he was very good at playing young peasants.
    "...Last year, I went to Moscow and Budapest, where we performed operas and also performed the waist drum..."
    He had attended the World Youth Congress, and he had heard the chimes of the Kremlin on Red Square in Moscow; he had heard the calls for peace from people of all countries in Budapest. He told his fellow travelers in the train how much the Hungarian people respected the new Chinese people, and when they heard the name of Mao Zedong, no matter where or when, they would immediately be elated. He told us that the Soviet people, the Hungarian people, and we—the Chinese people—are all peace-loving and willing to fight to defend peace as brave and hardworking people.
    His words stirred everyone in the train. Yes, we are traveling here precisely to defend our country and protect our homes, and to defend world peace.
    "After the war, I hope we can still sit in a train like this, only the locomotive will be pointing in the opposite direction, sending us back home!"
    "That day will come!" I said.
    At this moment, joy enveloped us, and happiness made our eyes moist.
    "I also have a hope that after the victory, I can buy a piano, oh, how much an opera actor needs a piano..."
    The train is galloping, climbing over mountains, and galloping forward over mountain after mountain...
    Mountains, roads, wind, everything is far behind us, we are going to rush to the place of victory!
    The comrades began to sing, and I heard the young actor's loud voice!
    "Goodbye, dear mother, don't be sad, don't be grieved, bless us with a safe journey!
    Goodbye, dear mother, please kiss your son goodbye!
    Goodbye, dear hometown, the star of victory will shine upon us..."
    I love this song of the Youth League members very much.
    Sitting here are the Chinese People's Volunteers, people from different posts, different places, living different lives, and with different hobbies. But these are all Chinese, although they are all ordinary Chinese, when the motherland needs them, no matter where—even in the most difficult places—there will be the sound of our singing for the joy of fighting!

### 列车在行进中

　　列车在行进中
    杜高
    白色的远山和路边的山坡迅速地后移着，卷着雪粉的冷风从车窗的缝隙里钻进来，雪花在车窗外舞动。
    列车在奔驰，飞快地在朝鲜的土地上奔驰着。
    许多个从不相识的人，在这里，这么紧紧地靠在一起。这些曾经过着不同生活的人，抱着一个愿望，在列车上，在水雪的山沟里聚在一块儿了。在这里，大家变成了战友；在这里，大家走着一条向前面去的路；只有在这里，生命靠着生命，联系得紧紧地。
    这节车厢里挤着不下六十个人，有年青的小伙子，也有中年人，有的在抽着烟，有的在聊天，有的打着瞌睡，有的则在低低地哼着自己爱唱的歌子。在各人心里，都有着一种很难捉摸的感情，但是，有着一个共同的为胜利的理想所鼓舞的激情，却把大家一齐联系在一起。
    这些人，都曾经过着和平的生活；这些人，都是在中国的土地上长大，现在都成了武装着的志愿兵。
    我的右边是一个担架队的队员，是个从田地里来的庄稼汉。看上去有三十多岁了，四方形的一张面孔，两只眼睛是乌黑而且发亮的，眉毛浓密，厚厚的鼻端在无声地起伏波动，额角上刻着一些皱纹。他一刻不停地抱着烟杆用力地吸着，虽然那烟草的味儿是很辣人的。
    是他先和我说话：“你到过朝鲜国么？”
    “没有，这是头一次。”
    “我也是头一回出远门哩，在家种庄稼，一天干一天的活，可没想到要到外国去。”他眯上眼睛“格格”地笑出声来了。
    “家里还有什么人吗？”
    “有媳妇儿，还有两个小子……”
    “他们高兴你参军？”
    “嗯！”他显然很不满意我的问话，回过头望着我，口里不停地向外喷着烟。“有什么不高兴？志愿参军，他们还盼着我抗大旗回家哩！”
    我沉默了下来，静静地听着他的声音。
    “这回朝鲜国遭美国鬼子的害，就像我们邻居的屋子叫火给烧着了，我们这个家也落上火星了，我能不帮着救火？……我们那块的人谁没吃过日本鬼子的苦？好容易共产党帮我们把房子搭起来了，又给分地，我还分得一头牲口哩，今年又是个丰收年！”
    “是呀，穷人有了地，活儿也干得起劲啦！”
    “今年，我还打算再添一头牲口，置一辆车子哩……我们庄稼人就心疼这块地，可不能让美国鬼子再来糟蹋……”他朝地上“拍”地吐了一口痰。
    “同志，你那块志愿军多么？”
    “可别提这了，为这事儿，我还得罪了周家二小子哩。我们那块人人抢着要参加志愿军，周家二小子想把我挤掉，那可不行……也难说，他给鬼子做过活牛马……。”停了一会，他突然低声地但是十分严肃地说：“我这回，什么也不想，就是想两桩事……”
    “倒是什么事呢？”
    “我这回，可得争取入党啦！还得缴一杆枪回家！”
    他的眼睛望着摇幌不定的烛光，格外显得发亮。
    我接过了他的旱烟杆，学着他的样子吸起烟来。
    靠在我的左边，坐着一个看来不过二十四五岁的年青同志，面目长得挺清秀的。他告诉我，他是一个歌剧演员，他在舞台上有过很好的成绩，他演过有名的歌剧《白毛女》和《血泪仇》。他说自己演青年农民是很出色的。
    “……去年，我到过莫斯科和布达佩斯，我们在那儿演过歌剧，还表演过腰鼓。……”
    他参加过世界青年代表大会，他在莫斯科的红场上听过克里姆林宫的钟声；他在布达佩斯听到过各国人民和平的呼声。他告诉列车里的旅伴们，匈牙利的人民多么看重新中国的人民，当他们一听到毛泽东的名字时，不管在那里，不管在什么时候，他们就立刻沸腾了起来。他告诉我们，苏联人民，匈牙利人民和我们——中国人民一样，是爱好和平，而且肯为保卫和平去战斗的勇敢的和勤劳的人民。
    他的话使列车里所有的人都激动起来了。是的，我们行进在这里，正是为着保家卫国，保卫世界和平的。
    “战争结束后，希望我们还能坐在一辆列车里，就像这样的，只是火车头调了一个方向，把我们送回国内去！”
    “会有这么一天的！”我说。
    在这个时候，喜悦包围住了我们，快活使得我们的眼睛都潮湿起来了。
    “我还有一个希望，胜利以后，能买一架钢琴，哦，一个歌剧演员多么需要一架琴……”
    列车在奔驰，翻过山，又翻一个山地朝前奔驰着……
    山，路，风，一切的一切都远远地落在我们的后头了，我们，要赶到胜利的地方去！
    同志们开始唱起歌来了，我听到年青的演员很响亮的声音！
    “再见吧，亲爱的妈妈，别难过，别悲伤，祝福我们一路平安吧！
    再见吧，亲爱的妈妈，请你吻别你的儿子！
    再见吧，亲爱的故乡，胜利的星会照耀着我们……”
    我很爱这支青年团员的歌。
    在这里坐着的，是中国人民志愿军，是来自各个不同岗位，各个不同地方，过着不同的生活，有着不同爱好的人。但是，这全是中国人，虽然都是些平平常常的中国人，当祖国需要的时候，不管是在什么地方——就算是最艰苦的地方，都会响着我们为战斗的欢乐而歌唱的声音！
