Xinhua News Agency report: The Central South region's autumn agricultural tax collection work for 1950, as of now, has been completed or over-fulfilled in Henan, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Guangdong, and the suburban areas of Wuhan and Guangzhou, with the exception of Guangxi Province. All collected public grain has been put into storage. Currently, local governments are actively leading warehouse cadres and mobilizing and educating the masses to inspect and protect the grain in storage, strengthening storage management.

Thanks to the farmers' enthusiastic contributions, the collection and storage of public grain in Central South this time have been very fast. However, because the time of grain delivery to warehouses coincided with the rainy season, most of the collected public grain was not sufficiently sun-dried. Some cadres, eager to achieve quick results in the collection work, focused solely on quick payments without waiting for farmers to dry and clean the grain thoroughly. As a result, a large amount of wet grain flowed into warehouses and soon began to generate heat. In addition, the preparatory work for warehouses before the collection was poorly done in various places, with insufficient and dispersed storage capacity, which also increased the difficulty of storage management. Currently, there are phenomena of public grain heating up due to dampness or becoming infested with insects in provinces such as Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Guangxi.

In order to strengthen public grain storage management, the Central South Military and Administrative Committee has continuously issued instructions, ordering governments at all levels in each province to quickly inspect granaries and prevent public grain from heating up and becoming moldy. The Central South Region Grain Bureau has required warehouse cadres in various places to carefully inspect warehouses and grain, and to carry out turning and drying; dispersed temporary warehouses must be immediately merged and concentrated to facilitate storage management. It requires local granaries to add ventilation equipment, establish appropriate door and window opening and closing systems, and inspection and turning systems. It also mobilized farmers in various places to assist the government in public grain storage management.

According to the above instructions, various provinces have begun to take action. Hunan Province has dispatched a large number of cadres to various places to supervise and inspect the work of checking warehouses and protecting grain. According to existing materials, about 104 million jin of rice in the province have been turned and dried, and the phenomenon of heating has basically stopped. The insect infestation has also largely stopped developing after being turned and dried and fumigated with pesticides.

### 中南加强公粮保管

　　中南加强公粮保管
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：中南区一九五○年度秋季农业税的征收工作，截至目前为止，除广西省外、河南、湖南、湖北、江西、广东和武汉、广州两市郊区，都已先后完成或超额完成。所收公粮都已入仓。现各地人民政府已积极领导仓库干部和动员教育群众，进行查仓护粮，加强保管工作。
    在农民踊跃缴纳下，这次中南各地公粮的征收和入仓都非常快。但由于送粮入库的时间正当雨季，以致所收公粮大部未经充分曝晒。部分干部在征收工作中又急于求成，不等农民把粮食晒干扬净，一味争取快缴，结果使大批湿粮流入仓库不久就发生发热现象。再加上开征前各地对仓库的准备工作作得很差，仓容不足而且分散，也增加了保管工作上的困难。目前湖南、湖北、江西、广西等省都有公粮因湿发热或生虫的现象发生。
    为加强公粮保管工作，中南军政委员会已连续发出指示，责成各省各级人民政府迅速检查粮仓，防止公粮发热发霉。中南区粮食管理局已要求各地仓库干部，认真查仓、查粮，进行翻晒；分散的临时仓库，务须立即并仓集中，以便于保管。要求各地粮仓增设通风设备，建立适当的门窗启闭制度，和检查、翻晒制度。并发动各地农民，协助政府进行公粮保管工作。
    根据上述指示，各省已开始行动起来。湖南省已抽调大批干部分赴各地进行督促检查查仓护粮工作。据现有材料了解，该省已有约一亿零四百万斤稻子进行了翻晒，发热的现象基本上停止了。生虫现象在进行翻晒和用药剂熏杀后大部也已停止发展。
