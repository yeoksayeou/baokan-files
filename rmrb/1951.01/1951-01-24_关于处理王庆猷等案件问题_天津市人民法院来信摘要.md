Regarding the Handling of Wang Qingyou and Other Cases
Excerpts from a Letter from the Tianjin Municipal People's Court

I. Regarding the Wang Qingyou Case (Letter Excerpt) To the Editor:
	We have carefully read both the letter from reader Wang Qingyou published in the People's Daily's "Letters from Readers" column on January 9th, reflecting "one year of filing a complaint without results," and the commentary "Judicial work should promptly and accurately handle mass complaint cases." We immediately examined the handling of the case. In addition to sincerely accepting your newspaper's criticism and promising to pay constant attention in our future work and try to expedite the handling of the case, we will briefly describe the progress of the case as follows:
	This case is a complicated partnership debt case involving a wide range of issues. The parties involved are Xi Jingyu, Jia Huiwen, and Wang Qingyou. Because the parties' statements about the case were inconsistent and there was no definitive supporting material, we had to summon relevant parties from all sides for questioning and conduct research to clarify the facts. This required a longer time for the trial.
	Xi Jingyu filed the lawsuit on January 30, 1950, against Jia Huiwen. Wang Qingyou filed the lawsuit on February 8 of the same year, against Xi Jingyu. We combined these two cases for trial. From the first court session on February 23, 1950, to October 21 of the same year, we summoned a total of thirteen parties and related persons and held twelve court sessions, with Wang Qingyou appearing in court eight times.
	The reasons for the delay in resolving the case quickly are: 1. The cadres lacked urban experience; 2. The case was handled jointly, and the personnel handling the case in our court were transferred several times; 3. The case was complex, and the parties were not honest enough; 4. Our court had few people and many tasks.
	In addition, Wang Qingyou claimed to be "of worker origin," "having worked as a porter for more than twenty years, saving up a little money," and "contributing ninety bolts of Da Wufu cloth to Xi Jingyu for investment." However, many facts prove otherwise. According to the submitted letters and receipts, there were also "gold" and "Xiao Bao" (clearly illegal activities). Wang Qingyou's one-sided exaggeration and concealment of facts increased the complexity of the case's disputes, making it difficult to distinguish right from wrong, which prolonged the litigation time. We believe that Wang Qingyou should bear some responsibility for this.

II. Regarding the Property Dispute Case of Zhou Wangshi Reflected by Zhou Kaicheng (Letter Excerpt) To the Editor:
	We have seen the reply from the Supreme People's Court to reader Zhou Kaicheng's letter on the third page of the People's Daily on December 29, 1950, and also received the Supreme People's Court's Secret Document No. 13798, as well as Zhou Kaicheng's original letter. Based on the five questions raised by Zhou Kaicheng regarding the property dispute case between Zhou Wangshi et al. and Liu Shenzhi, we have conducted an inspection and replied as follows:
	There was no "backlog of more than a year without a verdict" in our court in this case. The case was judged on March 15, 1949, declaring the defendant Liu Shenzhi innocent. The plaintiff Zhou Wangshi et al. appealed against the court's decision, and the superior court sent it back for retrial on June 30 of the same year for further proceedings. The retrial judgment on December 15 of the same year still declared the defendant innocent. The plaintiff refused to accept the decision and filed a second appeal. Our court sent the case file to the Supreme People's Court for trial on January 5, 1950.
	On September 6, 1950, the Supreme People's Court instructed us to investigate. Our court has conducted investigations on possible aspects. However, the plaintiff Zhou Wangshi and Zhou Zhangshi have moved residences, and two summonses have been unsuccessful. The case is currently under trial in the Supreme People's Court.

### 关于处理王庆猷等案件问题  天津市人民法院来信摘要

    关于处理王庆猷等案件问题
    天津市人民法院来信摘要
  一、关于王庆猷案件问题（来信摘要）编辑同志：
    一月九日人民日报读者来信栏所刊读者王庆猷关于“告状一年不得结果”的反映信和“司法工作应迅速准确处理群众控诉案件”的述评，我们都仔细读过了，并立刻对该案审理的情况进行了检查。我们除诚恳地接受贵报批评、愿在今后的工作上提起经常注意，设法尽速处理该案外，并将该案审理经过简述如下：
    该案是一件头绪繁杂、牵涉很广的合伙债务案件。当事人是西景玉、贾会文和王庆猷。因为当事人对该案供述不符，又没有确切的证明材料，为了明了事实真象，我们不得不从各方面传讯关系人，进行研究。这样在审理上，即需较长时间。
    西景玉起诉是在一九五○年一月三十日，被告是贾会文。王庆猷起诉是在同年二月八日，被告是西景玉。我们把这两件案子并案审理。自一九五○年二月二十三日第一次开庭以后，至同年十月二十一日止，其间传讯当事人及关系人共十三人，开庭十二次，王庆猷共出庭八次。
    所以迟迟未能迅速结案的原因：一、干部的城市经验不足；二、并案处理及本院处理该案人事几经调动；三、该案经过复杂，当事人都不够老实；四、本院人少事繁。
    另外，本案王庆猷自称是“工人出身”，“扛了二十多年脚行，积下一点钱”，“凑了大五福布九十匹交给了西景玉去入股”。但许多事实证明不是如此。根据交案信件及收条看，尚有“黄金”、“小宝”（显属违法行为）。由于王庆猷片面夸大，隐蔽事实，增加了案情的纠纷复杂，是非难辨，致使诉讼延长了时间。关于这一点，我们认为王庆猷是应负一定责任的。

  二、关于周凯诚所反映周王氏产权纠纷案问题（来信摘要）编辑同志：
    我们看到了一九五○年十二月二十九日人民日报第三版最高人民法院对读者周凯诚来信的答复，也收到了最高人民法院秘字第一三七九八号函，及转来的周凯诚原信。根据周凯诚所提关于周王氏等与刘慎之产权纠纷案的五个问题，已作检查，并答复如下：
    该案并无在本院“积压一年多始终未判”情况。该案于一九四九年三月十五日即已判决，宣告被告刘慎之无罪。原告周王氏等不服本院判决上诉，同年六月三十日上级法院发回更审，继续审理。是年十二月十五日更审判决，仍宣告被告无罪。原告不服，第二次提起上诉，本院于一九五○年一月五日将该案卷件送最高人民法院审理。
    一九五○年九月六日，最高人民法院曾函嘱调查，本院已就可能调查部分作了调查，唯原告周王氏，周张氏迁移住址，两次传讯无着。现该案在最高人民法院审理中。
