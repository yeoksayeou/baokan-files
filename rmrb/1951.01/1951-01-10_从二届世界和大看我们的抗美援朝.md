　　Looking at Our War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea from the Second World Peace Congress
　　Lu Cui

　　I remember the First World Peace Congress was held from April 20th to 25th the year before last, precisely when our "Million-Strong Army Crossed the Yangtze River." This historic and great victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War added infinite momentum to the Peace Congresses in Paris and Prague. The calls issued by the peace warriors from the World Peace Congress seemed particularly loud and powerful. Especially when the news of the liberation of Nanjing arrived, the completely spontaneous, enthusiastic, and house-shaking cheers that erupted in the Peace Congress fully demonstrated the support and endorsement of peace-loving people around the world for our people's liberation cause.

　　Coincidentally, the eve of the opening of this Second World Peace Congress was precisely the time when the American aggressors, disregarding all warnings, crossed the 38th parallel in Korea and pressed directly towards the Yalu River, seemingly invincible. At that time, the sky around the world seemed to have darkened. The shadow of a new world war weighed heavily on the hearts of every kind person. It was at that time that the liberated, awakened, and determined Chinese people, resolved to defend their hard-won victories and world peace, extended a hand of brotherly friendship to their invaded and bullied neighbors. The deployment of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and their joint combat with the Korean People's Army dealt a heavy blow to the American aggressors, curbed their rampant ferocity, reversed the situation in Korea, and thus blew away the haze of world war, allowing sunshine to reappear in the sky. People all over the world seemed to breathe a sigh of relief because of this, and heavy hearts became lighter. The Second World Peace Congress (November 16-22) was convened at this very moment.

　　It is not difficult to understand why the Chinese delegation, whether appearing in the conference hall or at other mass gatherings, was met with such warm and grateful eyes; why the glorious name of "Mao Zedong" was so frequently cheered and sung by the crowds surrounding them.

　　Let me give a few examples from the conference hall:

　　When it was our delegation leader Guo's turn to be the executive chairman at the conference, the secretary-general of the conference only said one sentence into the microphone, "Now, please welcome Mr. Guo Moruo, the leader of the delegation of the great Chinese people—" before he could finish speaking, the entire hall erupted in a storm of applause and cheers. At that time, many of our Chinese delegates were stunned because we knew it wasn't yet time for Leader Guo to speak! Looking up, we saw a sea of waving, beautiful five-star red flags. It turned out that on that day, our Chinese delegation had placed gifts for all the World Peace Congress delegates on each delegate's seat, and these gifts included a small national flag. At this moment, almost all the delegates raised this national flag high, many even standing on their chairs to hold it higher, waving it vigorously while shouting enthusiastic cheers. These cheers quickly merged into one tune, emitting the clear and unambiguous three words, "Mao Zedong!" "Mao Zedong!" This continued for four or five minutes, no matter how much our Leader Guo smiled and returned the greeting on the rostrum, and repeatedly gestured for everyone to sit down, it was difficult to stop it.

　　When Leader Guo solemnly denounced the American aggressors in his speech, declaring that "The Korean people are suffering disasters, and we cannot sit idly by," the hall erupted in thunderous applause that lasted for a long time. Many of the Eastern delegates next to us especially waved to our Chinese delegates, cheering "Mao Zedong!" "Mao Zedong!" with smiles on their faces.

　　Another of the most moving scenes was during the speech of Park Jung-ai, the chief representative of Korea. When she said at the end that the Korean people were deeply convinced that their struggle would surely achieve final victory, because "truth and justice are on their side," because "all peace-loving people, all peace warriors are with them," because, she emphasized, "their close neighbor, the most outstanding sons of the great Chinese people, have already organized volunteer troops to support the Korean people," the storm of applause and cheers completely drowned out her following words. When she finished speaking, hundreds of delegates left their seats and swarmed up, surrounding her; the Chinese female delegates, with tears in their eyes, hugged her tightly and kissed her; then people lifted her high and sent her back to the rostrum. Park Jung-ai, wearing the white dress that the Korean people love to wear, moved over the heads of the crowd, frequently waving her arms, like a flying white dove of peace.

　　The representatives of the World Peace Congress and the peace warriors of the world expressed their respect, love, support and endorsement for the heroic Korean people and the Chinese people who are resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea with great and just voluntary actions with irresistible enthusiasm.

　　This support was ultimately embodied in the historic documents solemnly passed by the Congress.

　　The letter to the United Nations clearly defined the definition of aggression, condemned the aggressors' atrocities of large-scale extermination of civilians in Korea, demanded an investigation into MacArthur's responsibility, insisted that all foreign aggressive troops withdraw from Korea, and that the Korean issue should be resolved peacefully with the participation of Korean people's representatives, and that this issue should be handled by the Security Council, including representatives of the People's Republic of China. All of this adopted the Chinese delegation's proposal to the Congress and was in line with the will of the Chinese, Korean, and peace-loving people around the world.

　　All of the above proves that the peace warriors of the world have recognized that the Korean issue is "the central key to the struggle to defend world peace today." This means that to win and defend world peace, we must first stop the US aggression in Korea. The practical action of the Chinese people to resist US aggression and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend our country is an effective step to achieve this goal, and therefore the most significant contribution of the Chinese people today to the cause of defending world peace.

　　Attending the Second World Peace Congress and returning has made us more aware of the great significance of the Chinese people's resistance to US aggression and aid to Korea, and has further strengthened our confidence in victory. The people of the whole world support the heroic struggle of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army. We must continue and expand our great and just movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend our country, and strive to implement the World Peace Congress resolution and fight for peace in Asia and the world!

　　从二届世界和大看我们的抗美援朝
    陆璀
    记得第一届世界和大在前年四月二十日到二十五日召开，恰恰是我们“百万雄师下江南”的时候。中国人民解放战争的这一历史性的伟大胜利，给巴黎和布拉格二地的和平大会平添了无限的声势。和平战士们从和大讲坛上发出的呼声似乎显得分外宏亮有力了。特别是南京解放的消息传到时，和大会场上所爆发的那种完全自发的、热烈的、震动屋宇的欢呼，充分证明了全世界爱好和平的人民对我们的人民解放事业的拥护与支持。
    说也凑巧，这次二届和大开幕的前夜，正是美国侵略者在朝鲜不顾一切警告，越过三八线，直逼鸭绿江，俨然不可一世的时候。那时，全世界的天空都似乎变得阴暗了。新的世界大战的阴影沉重地压在每一个善良人民的心上。就在那个时候，解放了的、觉悟了的、决心保卫自己的胜利果实与保卫世界和平的中国人民，毅然决然地向他们被侵略被欺侮的邻人伸出了兄弟般的友谊的手。中国人民志愿部队的出动以及他们和朝鲜人民军的并肩作战，沉重地打击了美国侵略者，遏止了它猖狂的凶焰，扭转了朝鲜的局势，从而吹开了世界战争的阴霾，使天空中重新出现了阳光。全世界的人民都似乎因此舒了一口气，沉重的心也变得轻松了一些。二届和大（十一月十六——二十二日）正是在这个时候召开的。
    这就不难理解，为什么中国代表团不论是在会场上或是在其他的群众场合上出现时，人们是用着那样热情的感激的眼光投向他们；为什么“毛泽东”这个光辉的名字是那样千百遍地被包围着他们的人群所欢呼和歌唱。
    举几个会场上的例子：
    当大会上轮到我们的郭团长当执行主席时，大会秘书长在扩音机中才说了一句“现在请伟大的中国人民的代表团团长郭沫若先生——”话犹未毕，全场已经响起了暴风雨似的掌声和欢呼。当时我们许多中国代表都为之一怔，因为我们知道郭团长发言的时间还没到呢！抬头一看，眼前已是一片招展着的千百面美丽的五星红旗。原来正是那天，我们中国代表团把分赠给全体和大代表的礼物分放在每一位代表的座位上，这些礼物中包括一面小小的国旗。这时差不多所有的代表都高高地举起了这面国旗，许多人还站到了椅子上去，以便举得更高些，一面把它用力地挥舞着，一面发出热烈的欢呼。这些欢呼的声音很快地合成一个调子，发出清楚的毫不含糊的三个字“毛泽东！”“毛泽东！”这样继续有四五分钟之久，任凭我们的郭团长怎样在主席台上含笑答礼，并且再三作着手势请大家坐下，还是难于停歇下来。
    当郭团长在发言中严正地斥责了美国侵略者，宣布“朝鲜人民遭受着灾难，我们不能坐视不理”时，全场又响起了久久不歇的雷鸣似的欢呼。邻座的许多东方的代表特别向我们中国代表挥手示意，满面笑容地向我们欢呼着“毛泽东！”“毛泽东！”
    另一次最动人的场面是在朝鲜的首席代表朴正爱发言的时候。当她在结尾时说到朝鲜人民深信自己的斗争必将获得最后胜利，因为“真理和正义是在他们这一边”，因为“一切爱好和平的人民，一切和平战士是和他们在一起”，因为，她着重地说，“他们的紧邻，伟大的中国人民的最优秀的儿子，已经组织了志愿部队来支援朝鲜人民”的时候，疾风暴雨似的掌声和欢呼声完全盖没了她底下的话语。当她讲完的时候，几百个代表离开座位，蜂拥而上，把她包围起来；中国的女代表噙着眼泪，紧紧地拥抱她，与她亲吻；然后人们把她高举起来，把她送还到主席台上。穿着朝鲜人民所最爱穿的白色衣裙的朴正爱，在人群的头上移动时，频频挥动着她的双臂，宛如一只飞舞着的和平白鸽。
    和大的代表们、全世界的和平战士们，就是这样地以无可遏止的热情来表达出他们对英勇斗争的朝鲜人民和以伟大的正义的志愿行动来抗美援朝的中国人民的崇敬、热爱、拥护和支持。
    这一拥护和支持最后还贯穿在大会所郑重通过的历史性的文件里。
    大会致联合国书里明确地规定了侵略的定义，谴责了侵略者在朝鲜大规模灭绝平民的暴行，要求调查麦克阿瑟的责任，坚持一切外国侵略军队撤出朝鲜，朝鲜问题应在朝鲜人民代表参加之下和平解决，这个问题应由包括中华人民共和国代表在内的安全理事会来处理。这一切，都是采纳了中国代表团向大会的建议，符合中国、朝鲜和全世界爱好和平人民的意志的。
    以上一切都证明了全世界的和平战士们已经认清：朝鲜问题是“今天保卫世界和平斗争的中心关键”。这就是说：要争取与保卫世界和平，必须首先制止美国在朝鲜的侵略。中国人民抗美援朝保家卫国的实际行动正是达到这个目的的有效步骤，因而也就是今天中国人民对保卫世界和平事业的最重大的贡献。
    出席了二届和大归来，使我们更加认识到中国人民抗美援朝的伟大意义，更加增强了我们必胜的信心。全世界的人民都支持着我们中国人民志愿部队和朝鲜人民军的英勇斗争。我们一定要继续与扩大我们的抗美援朝保家卫国的伟大的正义的运动，为贯彻和大决议，争取亚洲与全世界的和平而斗争！
