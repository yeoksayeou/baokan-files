　　Hebei Lixian militiaman Liu Hongzhan
    Learns to read newspapers and write letters in just over a year
    Liu Hongzhan, a militiaman from Wangjiaying Village, Fourth District, Li County, is twenty-six years old this year. In the past, he was an illiterate who couldn't understand calculations or recognize banknotes, and often suffered losses when buying things. After liberation, Liu Hongzhan eagerly demanded to learn culture. He felt very depressed when he saw others reading books and newspapers. In October of the year before last, a people's school was established in the village, and he automatically signed up to participate in the study. He worked hard at studying, made a small blackboard for himself, ordered some small notebooks, and wrote down any characters he didn't recognize to ask others, and insisted on studying every day. In this way, he learned more than 400 characters in just over two months. Last year, the village suffered from a flood, and the harvest was poor. Liu Hongzhan made a study plan for the winter in the autumn. Since the beginning of winter, in addition to making tofu and grinding beans, he seized all the time to study, and also led eleven nearby young people to form a group to study on the heated kang in the tofu workshop, and helped women organize study groups. In addition, he also mobilized five people from the village's wooden cabinet factory to get together to read newspapers in the evening. He came up with many methods to study, such as: when he went out to sell tofu every day, he would recognize the slogans and notices on the wall, and if he didn't know them, he would write them down and ask the teacher when he returned to the village; he wrote the words he had learned on pieces of cardboard, put them in his pocket, and took them out to test himself at any time.
    In the past year, Liu Hongzhan has learned more than 1,000 characters, can read newspapers, and can also write simple letters! He has learned two-digit multiplication on the abacus. In order to strengthen his current affairs studies, he recently subscribed to a newspaper and read every major news item to everyone, actively publicizing the cause of resisting America and aiding Korea. Recently, at the district people's school meeting, Liu Hongzhan was elected as a model student.

　　河北蠡县民兵刘洪展
    一年多学会看报写信
    蠡县四区王家营村民兵刘洪展，今年二十六岁，过去是个不识字的文盲，算账、认票子等都搞不清楚，买东西时常吃亏。解放后，刘洪展迫切要求学文化，他看见人家看书、看报，自己感觉很苦闷。前年十月，村里成立民校，他就自动报名参加了学习。在学习上很下工夫，自己做了一块小黑板，订了一些小纸本子，碰到不认识的字便记下来去问别人，每天都坚持学习。这样，学了两个多月便学会了四百多字。去年，这村受了水灾，年景歉收，刘洪展在秋季就订出了冬季的学习计划。入冬以来他每天除去做豆腐推磨子的时间外，他抓紧一切时间学习，还带动了附近青年十一人组成小组，在豆腐房的热炕上学习，并帮助妇女组织学习组。另外还发动了本村木柜厂五人晚上凑在一起读报。他想出了很多方法来学习，如：每天出去卖豆腐的时候，看见墙上的标语、布告等便认，不知道的记下来回村问老师；用硬纸片写上学过的字，放在衣袋里，随时拿出来自己考自己。
    一年来，刘洪展已经学会一千多字了，能看报，也能写简单的信啦！珠算学到了两位乘法。为了加强时事学习，最近他订了一份报纸，把每条大消息念给大家听，积极宣传抗美援朝的事儿。最近，区民校会议上，刘洪展当选了学习模范。
