Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 13th. The Catholic priests of Nanchang Diocese, Deng Bingguang (formerly mistakenly written as Deng Bingxian), Zhang Bailiang, and parishioners Gao Yongcheng and others, 894 people in total, have jointly issued a declaration of anti-American patriotic renewal movement. The declaration calls on Catholics in various places to follow the example of more than 500 church members in Guangyuan County, northern Sichuan, led by Father Wang Liangzuo, and strive for the successful completion of the Chinese Catholic renewal movement. The full text of the declaration is as follows:

Chinese Catholic brothers and sisters:

As all of you brothers and sisters know, the doctrine of our Catholicism is to love peace and love our motherland. However, imperialists always want to use our religion as a tool for cultural aggression. Countless vivid facts in China's history over the past century can illustrate this. Recently, the slanderous remarks made by American imperialist representative Austin in the Security Council, saying that they had run church schools and many relief and charitable undertakings in China, calling this the "friendship" and "cultural exchange" between the Chinese and American people. After seeing this, we felt very angry, believing that this was the greatest insult to the Chinese people and Chinese church members. Combined with the St. Louis Nursing Class incident in our city, it has further enhanced our understanding and vigilance against the imperialists' use of church schools for cultural aggression. In order to express our position of supporting peace, to promote our anti-American patriotic sentiments, and to maintain the sanctity of our church, we Catholic brothers and sisters can no longer endure it. We resolutely stand up to denounce the vicious methods and sinister conspiracies of American imperialism. We must follow the example of more than 500 church members in Guangyuan County, northern Sichuan, led by Father Wang Liangzuo, and strive to achieve the three major principles of autonomy, self-propagation, and self-support, and eliminate the influence of American imperialism on every church member's mind in the past, and establish a new perspective of hating, despising, and looking down on America.

Brothers and sisters! Today, we Chinese people have stood up and become the masters of our own country, and every citizen is living a free and happy life. However, American imperialism treats us with jealous eyes, trying its best to destroy the fruits of our victory. Facts show that they will burn the flames of aggression against Korea to the doorstep of China. We church members can no longer stand idly by. "The rise and fall of the country is the responsibility of every citizen," and church members are naturally no exception. Now is the time for us to rise up with our swords. Let us unite and concentrate our strength to smash the shackles imposed on us by American imperialism and fight for democracy and peace.

We held a meeting in Nanchang on December 30, 1950. Under the anger of common hatred against the enemy, all church members unanimously approved and shouted: Strive for the victorious completion of the renewal movement.

This declaration is hereby made. We also hope that advanced people inside and outside the church will respond, instruct, and support us. We call on the 140,000 Catholic brothers and sisters in Jiangxi to sign this declaration first.

Initiators: Deng Bingguang (Chinese priest), Zhang Bailiang (Chinese priest), Sun Yaohan (Chinese priest), Zeng Mian, Ding Yimei, Zong Yongmei, Tao Linggen, Yang Hong, Rao Weifeng, Fan Bingyan, Liao Zhangzhu, Deng Zezhong, Deng Yisheng, Xiong Wenhui, Wan Jinyu, Liu Deyi, Li Sixian, Ding Chengya, Zeng Huifang, Shu Zihan, Wan Liezu, Hu Dehua, Cai Dezhen, Xie Zhiren, and 894 signatories including Gao Yongcheng.

　　南昌天主教徒宣言
    【新华社南昌十三日电】天主教南昌教区神父邓秉光（前误为邓秉先）、章百良及教徒高永成等八百九十四人，顷联名发表反美爱国革新运动宣言。宣言号召各地天主教徒向川北广元县以王良佐神父为首的五百多位教友看齐，为中国天主教革新运动的胜利完成而努力。宣言全文如下：中国天主教教友们：
    各位教友都很明白，我们天主教的教义，本是爱和平、爱祖国，可是帝国主义却总想利用我教来作文化侵略的工具。在中国近百年的历史中，无数鲜明的事实可以说明。最近美帝国主义代表奥斯汀在安理会上发表的谰言，说什么在中国办了教会学校和许多救济慈善事业，说这是中美人民的“友谊”和“文化交流”。我们看到以后，感到非常愤怒，认为这是对中国人民及中国教会人士的最大侮辱。再结合本市圣类思护士班事件，更提高了我们对帝国主义利用教会学校进行文化侵略的认识和警惕。为了表示我们拥护和平的立场，为了伸张我们反美爱国的情绪，为了保持我们教会的圣洁，我们天主教教友们不能再忍受了。我们坚决地站起来痛斥美帝国主义的毒辣手段和狠毒阴谋。我们要向川北广元县以王良佐神父为首的五百多教友看齐，争取做到自治、自传、自养的三大原则，并在每个教友心理上肃清过去所受美帝国主义的影响，建立起仇美、鄙美、蔑美的新观点。
    教友们！今天我们中国人民已经翻了身，作了自己国家的主人翁，每个人民都过着自由愉快的日子。可是美帝国主义却以妒视的眼光来对待我们，竭力想破坏我们这胜利的果实。事实说明，它们会把侵朝的战火燃烧到中国的门口，我们教友，再不能袖手旁观了。“国家兴亡，匹夫有责”，教友们自然不能例外，现在已经到了我们拔剑而起的时候了。我们团结起来，集中力量，击碎美帝国主义所给我们的枷锁，为民主和平而奋斗。
    我们已于一九五零年十二月三十日在南昌举行集会，在敌忾同仇的怒火下，全体教友同声赞许高呼：为革新运动的胜利完成而努力。
    谨此宣言。并希教内外先进人士，给我们响应、指示和支持。我们号召江西十四万天主教教友们首先在这一宣言上签名。
    发起人：邓秉光（中国神父）、章百良（中国神父）、孙耀汉（中国神父）、曾勉、丁逸梅、宗咏梅、陶灵根、杨泓、饶为凤、范丙炎、廖掌珠、邓择中、邓义生、熊文辉、万瑾瑜、刘德毅、李思贤、丁成亚、曾蕙芳、舒孜汉、万烈祖、胡德华、蔡德贞、谢志仁，签名者有高永成等八百九十四人。
