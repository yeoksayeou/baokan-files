　　Pangjiabao Mine Erroneously Dug a Tunnel
    Wasting Over 200,000 Jin of Millet
    The Pangjiabao Mine of the Longyan Iron Mine, which is currently being restored and rebuilt, has experienced serious waste due to blind production plans and a lack of responsibility during operations, resulting in the erroneous digging of a tunnel. According to the discovery on December 13, 1950: The electric tram mining road in the East No. 30 stone tunnel in the new engineering area (the main production unit in 1951) was incorrectly constructed. The difference in slope between the inside and outside of the tunnel is 2.3 meters. According to incomplete statistics, 9,143 man-days were wasted (each man-day equals 9 jin and 12 liang of millet), totaling 90,144.5 jin of millet; 7,543 detonators were wasted (each detonator equals 2 jin of millet), totaling 15,086 jin of millet; 482 electric detonators were wasted, equivalent to 1,928 jin of millet, and the waste of fuse, calcium carbide, explosives, etc. amounted to over 226,800 jin of millet. A total of 418.2 cubic meters were wrongly constructed, with a length of 110 meters. If yellow dynamite, rail spikes, screws, angle steel, and other items are added, the waste figure would be even more enormous. This error was not accidental. Prior to this, there was an error in the excavation of the No. 44 tunnel, and the leadership did not pursue responsibility. The main reason is that there is serious bureaucracy in the production leadership of Pangjiabao, production plans are blind, and there are more arrangements than inspections in the production process. For example, during the 110-meter excavation of the No. 30 stone tunnel, the center line was not clear and did not meet specifications (the center lines of other tunnels were also unclear), and the project was found to be wrong after a year. To what extent is this careless? It is recommended that the leadership of Longyan Iron Mine seriously investigate and resolve the responsibility.

### 庞家堡采矿所打错坑道  浪费了小米二十多万斤

　　庞家堡采矿所打错坑道
    浪费了小米二十多万斤
    正在恢复修建的龙烟铁矿庞家堡采矿所，由于生产计划盲目，操作过程中无人负责，曾做错坑道发生严重浪费现象。据一九五○年十二月十三日发现：新工程区（五一年主要生产单位）东三十号石巷电车运矿路做错，该坑里外坡度相差二·三米，据不完全统计，浪费人工九千一百四十三个（每工合九斤十二两米），共九万零一百四十四斤半小米；雷管浪费七五四三个（每个合二斤米）共一五○八六斤小米，电雷管浪费四八二个，折小米共一九二八斤，及导火线、电石、炸药等项共浪费小米二十二万六千八百余斤，共做错四一八·二立方米，长达一一○公尺，若再加黄药、道钉、螺丝钉、八角钢等其浪费数字更为庞大。此次错误发生，并不是偶然的，在此以前曾有四十四号坑道打错掘进，领导机关也没追责任。其主要原因：是庞家堡生产领导上存在着严重的官僚主义，生产计划盲目，生产过程中布置多，检查少。如三十号石巷坑道一一○公尺掘进当中，中心腰线不明确，不合乎规格（其他坑道中心腰线也不明确），工程作错了一年才发觉。马虎到何种程度？建议龙烟铁矿领导上应认真追究责任，加以解决。
