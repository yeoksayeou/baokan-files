　　Activating the Domestic Market Through Exchange of Industrial and Agricultural Products
    Various Regions Vigorously Carry Out Materials Exchange
    [Report from this newspaper] Currently, various regions are vigorously carrying out materials exchange work. State-owned trading companies, cooperatives, and transportation departments are mobilizing all forces to carry out the exchange of industrial and agricultural products by signing contracts, developing chain operations, and organizing private merchants to go to the countryside, in order to achieve the task of agricultural and sideline products entering the cities and industrial products going to the countryside, thus activating the domestic market.

    First is the purchase and sales contract business of the cooperative system. The materials exchange among the three major regions of North China, Northeast China, and East China, organized by the All-China Federation of Cooperatives, is being gradually implemented. As of December 23 last year, 180 tons of soybean cakes had been shipped from the Northeast to areas within the customs, and 220,000 catties of ginned cotton and more than 21,000 bolts of various fabrics were shipped to the Northeast in December. Driven by this exchange plan, cooperatives at all levels in the three major regions have launched intensive procurement and marketing operations. The Northeast Cooperative Federation convened a business meeting of cooperatives in the entire region in early December last year. Various brother cooperatives signed 39 exchange contracts. The exchanged materials included 18 kinds of items such as pork, fish, wheat, rice, apples, and dried sea shrimp, worth approximately 258.5 billion yuan (Northeast currency). The Northeast Federation also signed many joint operation contracts with provincial and municipal federations to improve operational capabilities and expand the scope of business, purchasing and operating cattle, sheep, pig bristles, and casings from Inner Mongolia and Rehe, and New Year goods such as red dates, fresh ginger, children's hats, socks, and colorful printed cloths from within the customs. In addition, the Northeast Federation has also ordered 30,000 bags of flour, 700,000 catties of dried tofu, and 40,000 tons of soybean cake from the Songjiang Provincial Federation, which are being processed by enterprises affiliated to various levels of cooperatives. Of the plan to purchase 130,000 tons of grain from December last year to February this year, according to statistics from Liaoxi, Songjiang, and Heilongjiang provinces alone, 9,259 tons have been completed, and 2,190 tons have been shipped out. As of January 12, 40% of the purchase plan of 8,800 tons of green jute has also been completed. On December 6 last year, the cooperatives of the five provinces in North China signed an agreement for the exchange of cloth and grain. The Hebei Provincial Federation of Cooperatives will purchase 100,000 bolts of homespun cloth from members, and Pingyuan will purchase 10,000 bolts, for a total of 110,000 bolts, and transport them to the receiving points of various provincial federations in Zhangjiakou, Guisui, Baotou, Taiyuan, and other places. Suiyuan will purchase 3 million catties of grain, Chahar will purchase 3.5 million catties of grain, and Shanxi will purchase 300,000 catties of millet, for a total of 6.8 million catties of grain, and transport them to the receiving points in Hebei and Pingyuan. Then, the provincial federations will meet the needs of their members through their own systems. The above-mentioned grain and cloth are required to be delivered by the end of January this year. In addition, within Shandong Province, the provincial federation is exchanging 55,000 bolts of printed cloth, 36 million catties of grain, and a batch of soybean cakes for farmers' tobacco leaves and peanuts. Facts have proved that the contract system has become the main form and powerful weapon for purchasing and selling industrial and agricultural products, realizing a reasonable price policy, and thus closely connecting the state-owned economy, the cooperative economy, and small rural producers. In the business process of recent months, the contract system has been further developed. In addition to order contracts, purchase contracts and barter contracts have also been further promoted. The Yongnian County Cooperative in Hebei, the Lishu Cooperative in Liaoxi, and the Wanquan and Yanqing County Cooperatives in Chahar Province have all gained successful experience in purchasing surplus grain and cotton from members using the purchase method. Cooperatives in Dezhou and Wendeng prefectures of Shandong organized the exchange of peanuts, yellow tobacco, grain, cotton, cloth, department stores, and other items, which accelerated the completion of the state's purchase tasks and met farmers' needs for means of livelihood, and were therefore warmly welcomed by the vast number of farmers.

    Second, state-owned trading companies have created a chain operation method under the general goal of developing the domestic market in a coordinated manner. The flower-yarn-cloth and grain companies in Lingbao, Henan, carried out chain operations during the cotton harvest period. The specific methods are: 1. When purchasing cotton, the flower-yarn-cloth company can issue grain exchange receipts to cotton farmers according to their needs, which can be used to exchange for the required grain at the grain company. 2. The grain company must give priority to those who exchange grain with special grain exchange certificates. 3. The grain company should notify the flower-yarn-cloth company of various grain prices one day in advance for cotton farmers to choose from. 4. The two companies reconcile their accounts every night. The flower-yarn-cloth company in Dingxian Prefecture, Hebei, and the grain, department store, oil and grease, coal and iron, and salt companies have launched chain exchange operations centering on cotton purchase, providing a large amount of grain, cloth, coal, salt, and other necessities in a timely manner in exchange for farmers' cotton, thus activating urban-rural relations and safeguarding the legitimate interests of cotton farmers. According to statistics on December 18 last year, Yangjiaying Village alone exchanged 906 catties and two taels of cotton. Flower-yarn-cloth companies in Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Shandong, southern Jiangsu, and northern Jiangsu have all established purchase, barter, chain operation contracts, and transfer account systems with other companies and cooperatives. The result of this business development is that, on the one hand, it saves the state's cash expenditure and avoids price fluctuations that may be caused by the sudden increase in currency; on the other hand, it can solve farmers' needs for means of production and livelihood in a timely and appropriate manner, and complete the purchase and sales tasks of state-owned trading agencies.

    Third, unite and organize private industrial and commercial operators to jointly carry out urban-rural materials exchange. Tianjin, Beijing, Shanxi, Datong, and other places have successively organized industrial and commercial inspection groups to go to the Northwest, North China, and Central and Southern China to inspect the production and sales of local and special products and their patterns. After the new cotton was put on the market last autumn, the industrial and commercial departments in cotton distribution markets in various places widely organized joint operations and joint purchases. Since the beginning of winter, in order to improve the leadership of urban-rural trade, urban-rural liaison committees (Wuhan), urban-rural economic committees (Datong), urban-rural production and purchase committees (Nanchang) and other institutions have been established in various places to specifically promote materials exchange. The industrial and commercial departments in Nanchang City generally issue introduction letters to the village teams to obtain the assistance of district and township governments. Each prefecture in Pingyuan Province has invited representatives of private merchants to study methods for purchasing agricultural products and formulate purchase plans. The leaders of Cangxian Prefecture, Hebei, further educated district and village cadres and farmers to provide various conveniences to private merchants who go to the countryside to purchase and sell goods. In order to facilitate transportation, local people's governments have mobilized migrant workers to repair roads. Chahar Province mobilized 100,000 farmers to repair 10,000 kilometers of highways. Hebei has formed a provincial-wide water and land transportation network and set up hostels for passengers and goods along the way. The Zhemeng People's Government repaired the temporary wooden bridge over the Xiliao River, which saved the masses 10 billion yuan in boat ticket money in sixty-six days.

    Because all systems and departments have concentrated their efforts, moved in step, and worked together to promote urban-rural materials exchange, since the beginning of winter, urban-rural materials have been basically smooth, gradually reducing the blindness and one-sidedness in previous work, making many local products with poor sales (such as straw mats and straw ropes in the Northeast) now in short supply, thus greatly encouraging farmers' enthusiasm for winter production.

　　交换工农业产品活跃国内市场
    各地大力开展物资交流
    【本报讯】目前各地正大力开展物资交流工作。国营贸易公司、合作社及交通运输部门，正在动员一切力量，通过签订合同、开展连环业务和组织私商下乡等方式，来进行工农产品交换，以达成农副产品进城，工业品下乡，活跃国内市场的任务。
    首先是合作系统的购销合同业务。全国合作总社组织的华北、东北、华东三大地区的物资交换，正在逐步实施。截至去年十二月二十三日，东北运入关内的豆饼已有一百八十吨，十二月份运往东北的皮棉也达二十二万斤、各种布二万一千多匹。在这一交换计划带动下，三大地区的各级合作社，均展开了紧张的收购运销业务。东北合作总社去年十二月初召开全区合作社的业务会议，各个兄弟社签订了三十九份交换合同，交换物资包括白条猪、鱼、小麦、大米、苹果、大海米等十八种，共约值二千五百八十五亿元（东北币）。东北总社还与各省、市社签订了许多联合经营合同，以提高经营能力，扩大业务范围，收购和经营内蒙与热河的牛、羊和猪鬃、肠衣，关内的红枣、鲜姜、小孩帽、袜及各色花布等年货。此外，东北总社并向松江省社订购面粉三万袋、豆腐干七十万斤、豆饼四万吨，正由各级社附属的企业中进行加工。预定自去年十二月至今年二月收购十三万吨粮食的计划，仅据辽西、松江、黑龙江三省统计，已完成九千二百五十九吨，并已运出二千一百九十吨。青洋麻八千八百吨的收购计划，至一月十二日，也已完成百分之四十。华北五省合作社于去年十二月六日签订了布粮交换协议。由河北省总社收购社员土布十万匹，平原收购一万匹，共十一万匹，运往张家口、归绥、包头、太原等地各省社收货地点。绥远收购粮食三百万斤，察省收购粮食三百五十万斤，山西收购小米三十万斤，共粮食六百八十万斤，运往河北、平原的收货地点，然后由各省社通过自己的系统去满足社员需要。上述粮布都要求于今年一月底运交完成。另外，在山东全省内，省总社正以花色布五万五千匹、粮食三千六百万斤和一批豆饼来换取农民的烟叶和花生米。事实证明，合同制度已成为收购推销工农产品，实现合理的价格政策，从而密切国营经济、合作经济与农村小生产者的主要形式和有力武器。近几个月来的业务进程中，合同制得到进一步发展，这就是除了订货合同之外，赊购合同与易货合同也得到进一步的推广。河北的永年县合作社、辽西的梨树合作社、察省的万全、延庆两县社，用赊购办法收购社员余粮和棉花，均已得到成功的经验。山东德州、文登等专区的合作社，组织花生米、黄烟、粮食、棉花、布匹、百货等物品的互换，加速完成了国家的收购任务，满足了农民对生活资料的需求，因而受到广大农民热烈的欢迎。
    第二是国营贸易公司在齐一步调发展国内市场的总目标下，创造了连环业务的工作方式。河南灵宝的花纱布、粮食两公司，在收花期间开展连环业务。具体办法是：一、花纱布公司购花时，可根据棉农要求给予换粮执据，拿到粮食公司换买所需粮食。二、凡特换粮证买粮者粮食公司得尽先付给。三、粮食公司应将各种粮价先一日通知花纱布公司，以便棉农选购。四、两公司每晚对账清结。河北定县专区花纱布公司与粮食、百货、油脂、煤铁、盐业等公司围绕购棉展开换购连环业务，及时地大量地供给粮、布、煤、盐等必需品换取农民的棉花，从而活跃了城乡关系，维护了棉农应得的利益。按去年十二月十八日统计，只杨家营一个村就换出棉花九百零六斤二两。江西、浙江、山东、苏南、苏北等地花纱布公司，均与其他公司及合作社，建立了赊购、易货、连环业务合同和转账往来制度。这一业务开展的结果，一方面节省了国家的现金支出，避免了因通货骤增可能引起的物价波动，另方面又能及时地恰当地解决农民对生产和生活资料的要求，并完成国营贸易机关的购销任务。
    第三是团结与组织私营工商业者共同开展城乡物资交流。天津、北京、山西、大同等地先后组织工商业考察团赴西北、华北及中南各地考察土、特产产销情况及规律。去秋新棉上市之后，各地棉花集散市场的工商部门，又广泛组织联营联购，入冬以来，为了健全城乡贸易的领导，各地分别成立城乡联络委员会（武汉）、城乡经济委员会（大同）、城乡生产购销委员会（南昌）等机构，专门负责推动物资交流工作。南昌市工商部门，普遍给下乡小组写介绍信，以便取得区乡政府的协助。平原省各专区都曾邀请私商代表研究收购农产品的办法，订定收购计划。河北沧县专区领导上更教育区、村干部和农民给下乡购销私商以种种方便。为了便利交通运输，各地人民政府都动员民工整修道路。察省动员十万农民，修整公路一万公里，河北已组成全省范围的水陆运输网，并在沿途设立客货栈。哲盟人民政府，修复西辽河临时木桥，六十六天中即节省群众买船票钱百亿元。
    由于各系统、各部门集中力量，齐一步调，共同为开展城乡物资交流而努力，故入冬以来，城乡物资基本流畅，逐渐减少了以前工作中的盲目性和片面性，使好多销路不畅的土产（如东北的草席、草绳），现在成为供不应求，因而大大鼓舞了农民冬季生产的积极性。
