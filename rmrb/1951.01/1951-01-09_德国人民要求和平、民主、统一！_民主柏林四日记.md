　　The German People Demand Peace, Democracy, and Unity!
　　A Four-Day Diary in Democratic Berlin
　　Zhong Huai
　　I had the opportunity to make a four-day trip to Democratic Berlin. On the morning of December 3, 1950, I left Prague by train.

　　The scenery along the Czech-German border was very beautiful. The sky was azure, and the emerald green Elbe River flowed quietly, almost parallel to the railway. On the banks, rows of quaint and exquisite houses with red roofs and grayish-white brick walls dotted the foothills thickly covered with jungles. Although it was early winter, the grassland was still lush green. It seemed like a scene described in a European fairy tale, making it hard to believe that this was the Sudetenland, the first to bear the brunt of the Nazi invasion of Europe. Upon arriving in Dresden, the scene was completely different. Along the way were ruins and broken walls; looking into the city from the station, the skeletons of steel and concrete buildings bombed during the war stood far apart in rows. An old German man sitting in the same carriage with me sighed in broken English, "Look, this is war! This is war!"

　　When I arrived in Berlin, it was already late. I was received by friends and accommodated in the guesthouse of the German Democratic Republic. My room was on the third floor, facing the street. Opening the window, I could see a small open space in front; across the street was a pile of rubble, a ruin; but it was illuminated by bright lights. Surrounding it was a light railway, and many workers were busy knocking bricks and stones. Friends told me that the open space was formerly a square named after Bismarck, but now it has been renamed to commemorate the outstanding son of the German nation, the leader of the working people, Ernst Thälmann, who was imprisoned for ten years by fascist bandits and eventually murdered in a concentration camp. That pile of rubble was the site of Hitler's headquarters, with basements eight meters deep. The Democratic Berlin City Government is demolishing and clearing the ruins, preparing to rebuild new buildings for the people on this grave of fascist death.

　　Until I went to sleep, the sound of knocking bricks and unloading things still rose and fell in the silence. My first night in Berlin was filled with a complex mix of impressions: the beauty of peace, the disaster of war; the death of fascism, the reconstruction of a new life.

　　During my short days in Berlin, I tried my best to visit, tour, and talk with friends, hoping to get some answers to long-standing questions. I often wondered what the German people really thought about the past, present, and future after the collapse of the Nazis? What did they think of the division of their country into two opposing zones? Did they want more war? What were the differences between life in East and West Germany?

　　When I was in Berlin, the newspaper "Neues Deutschland," the organ of the Socialist Unity Party, published a letter from the Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, Otto Grotewohl, to the Prime Minister of the "Bonn Government," Konrad Adenauer, on December 1st, in which he proposed that Adenauer jointly promote German reunification. Friends explained to me that since the Prague Conference of Eight Foreign Ministers on October 21st proposed that East and West Germany elect an equal number of representatives to organize an all-German constitutional assembly and form a unified government, a major shift had taken place in German politics. The spirit of the Prague Conference was widely explained and promoted in mass rallies throughout East Germany. On October 26th, the Socialist Unity Party convened a central plenary session, and General Secretary Walter Ulbricht declared that he was prepared to negotiate the issue of German reunification with representatives from West Germany at the same table. He said, "I believe that among the leaders of the West German government, there must be people who are not influenced by the United States and Britain and can think for Germany." He pointed out that the Prague Conference opened up a bright future for the German people, allowing them to decide the fate of their country. The German Democratic Republic did not believe that a future unified Germany must be a Germany modeled after it; both East and West Germany should make concessions. The "Bonn Government's" response to East Germany's proposal was a barrage of abuse, saying that sincere unification and so on were all propaganda slogans. However, the broad masses of the West German people enthusiastically supported the proposal for the democratic reunification of their homeland.

　　Generally speaking, the impression of the Prague Conference on the West German people was very deep. The fact that the representatives of the German Democratic Republic attended international conferences in an equal capacity and sat with the representatives of the Soviet Union to discuss the overall situation was a great excitement for the German people. The division of the motherland meant war. The US High Commissioner for Occupied Germany, John J. McCloy, once said that the Korean "incident" might be staged in Germany, and this shameless clamor aroused strong opposition from the West German people. Although under the high pressure of the US occupation forces and the puppet Adenauer government, the workers in West Germany still enthusiastically carried out the signature campaign in support of the Prague Conference. The Christian authority leader Martin Niemöller (in West Germany) publicly stated that he unconditionally supported unification, even if this unification was under the "leadership of atheistic communists." Following this, the Christians convened a general representative assembly, which passed a resolution unanimously supporting the unification of Germany and opposing rearmament.

　　The actions of Democratic Germany are paving the way for the realization of peaceful unification in every aspect. On October 15th of last year, a general election was held throughout the republic, simultaneously electing the People's Chamber, the state, and municipal councils, but no elections were held in Democratic Berlin. Their explanation was: "Berlin does not belong to either side, it can only be the capital of a future unified and democratic Germany." After the election, on November 8th, the People's Chamber approved Grotewohl as Prime Minister, and on the 15th, formally ended the previous provisional government and established a new government, explicitly stating in the policy program that the decisions of the Prague Conference were the main direction of the new government's policy. Grotewohl wrote to Adenauer on December 1st, expressing his willingness to sincerely discuss the important matter of unification with representatives of the West German government. And the Mayor of Greater Berlin, Friedrich Ebert, also wrote to the Mayor of West Berlin, Ernst Reuter, on the second anniversary of the establishment of the Democratic Berlin City Government—November 30th—reiterating the proposal of the National Front on the 25th to the Soviet, American, British, and French occupation authorities, to first unify Berlin and then unify Germany, and scheduled a democratic and free election in all of Berlin in March of next year (i.e., 1951). The Soviet Control Commission quickly responded to the National Front's proposal with approval; the replies from the United States, Britain, and France were that they would never consider this proposal. On December 2nd, the Mayor of West Berlin also formally expressed his rejection of Ebert's proposal. On December 3rd, West Berlin actually held elections separately.

　　Do the Germans want war? When visiting factories, I asked many workers for their views on war. At the Siemens-Plania steel pipe factory in the suburbs of Democratic Berlin, female labor hero Truda Schaurka told me that her husband was Jewish and died in a concentration camp during the war; her son is now twenty-three years old, and because he dropped out of school as a child, he is now working with her in the factory, learning culture at the same time. Truda often feels sad about her son's past lack of education. She asked me, "Do you think I would want war?" I asked the same question to two other female workers in the same factory. One said, "War means the death of a husband and the killing of a child for me!" Another told me, "My husband disappeared in the war!" (The factory cultural instructor who was translating for me told me that the US imperialists deliberately withheld a list of casualties of the German army without publishing it, falsely claiming that these people were detained in concentration camps by the Soviet Union and not released, in an attempt to incite anti-Soviet sentiment by this despicable method. The husband of this female worker was one of the "disappeared" created by the US military.) Accompanying me on the visit was twenty-two-year-old Gert Hegert, a cadre of the Free German Youth League, whose parents both died in the war, leaving him alone. He said that many young people of his age are homeless.

　　Most of what you see on the streets of Berlin are elderly men and women, or women. Women work in many production departments of heavy industry just like men; female traffic police also serve on the streets. Hert told me that among the population of Berlin between the ages of twenty and thirty, men account for only 30 percent.

　　Looking from East Berlin, the destruction of the city is extremely serious. The Unter den Linden, once known as the showcase of Berlin, is full of rubble, broken walls, and the skeletons of buildings; galleries, museums, and universities are left with only the outer walls and some sculptures that have not been damaged by bombing. Although newly built houses can be seen everywhere, the devastation of the war is still very striking to a newly arrived traveler in Berlin.

　　The rubble left over from the war has not yet been cleared, and now there is talk of war again. The German people, including the West German people who are subjected to the venomous propaganda of the US imperialists every day, are naturally strongly opposed to it. The results of the general election held in West Germany at the end of November provided strong proof of the people's anti-war sentiment. Schumacher's Social Democratic Party fraudulently obtained many votes under the slogan of opposing rearmament. He declared to the voters that if they did not vote for the Social Democratic Party but voted for Adenauer's party, international understanding would regard it as an indication that they supported preparations for war. In the Bavarian region, traditionally dominated by the reactionary Catholic Democratic Party, the Social Democratic Party's votes exceeded those obtained by the Catholic Party. Although the anti-war German people were fooled by the hypocrite Schumacher of the Second International, their ardent desire for peace was fully expressed.

　　East and West Germany are like two worlds. The contrast between East and West Berlin is a microcosm of the two Germanies.

　　The entire Berlin is about one hundred li long from east to west, and the Soviet-occupied zone—commonly known as the democratic zone—accounts for about one-third. The population ratio is equivalent to this, with Democratic Berlin having a population of about 1.2 million. The two regions can be freely visited at ordinary times, and there is no one guarding the border, but it is easy for people to know where the democratic zone is and where the western occupied zone is.

　　In Democratic Berlin, new houses are being built, and old ones are being demolished. Workers' residences, department stores, and rows of modern buildings have replaced the ruins of three or four years ago. The site of the guesthouse where I stayed was the former site of a hotel frequented by Hitler, which had been bombed; the brand-new building on the right—now the headquarters of the National Front—was originally the site of Goebbels' propaganda department, which had been razed to the ground. In the center of Unter den Linden, several magnificent buildings are nearing completion. Hert said that in Berlin's five-year plan, this area will become the center of government agencies and embassies of various countries, "We want to restore this place to the showcase of the new Berlin."

　　Walking around the streets of Democratic Berlin, it is easy to see the "H.O." sign. Hert told me that since 1948, shopping no longer requires ration tickets and can be purchased in the free market. "H.O." is a state-owned store—a free market. At 6:00 a.m. on December 6th, we went to the largest "H.O." in Democratic Berlin. When we arrived, there were still two minutes before it opened, and five or six hundred people were waiting in front of the door. After entering, I browsed everywhere, from the bread and chocolate department to the wool, printed cloth, and silk department; from the children's toy department to the radio, record, book, and stationery department, and then to the perfume and cosmetics department. There were all kinds of goods, and the quality was very good. They were all German-made domestic products.

　　The purchasing power of the people in Democratic Berlin is generally high. The wages of ordinary workers are around 300 marks, and skilled workers are around 450 marks. Bread is 0.8 marks per kilogram. For a worker without family burdens, food accounts for a little less than 20 percent of his income; for a mother with two children of five or six years old, the proportion of her income spent on food is about 60 percent, and rent is 10 percent. I asked the workers at the Hannesdorf steel plant whether their income was enough. They told me that it was enough to cope with daily clothing, food, and housing, but if they wanted to add some new furniture or a warm coat, they would have to save for a while. A sturdy worker in his fifties, with a face full of coal dust, solemnly told me: "It's not easy! This is after the war!"

　　Workers' dormitories are clean apartment buildings, and factories have nurseries and kindergartens; larger factories have elementary schools, youth worker schools for young workers, and worker cultural palaces; factories further away from the city have their own "H.O." In Democratic Berlin, workers live a good life. There is no unemployment there, and many unemployed workers in West Berlin have also found work in factories in East Berlin.

　　Today, the countryside of Democratic Germany is a picture of abundance, and farmers are demanding higher cultural and recreational lives. In East Germany, land exceeding one hundred hectares has been evenly divided, with each person receiving about five hectares. The destruction suffered by the German countryside during the war was far less serious than that of the cities. After the war, Soviet machinery and tractors were widely used in the countryside, farmers organized mutual aid groups, and rural production quickly increased.

　　In East Germany, young people and children are the happiest. Young people have their own organization—the Free German Youth League. Hert told me that the number of people participating in the Youth League, together with the Young Pioneers, is already three million; women account for one-third of them. The age of the Young Pioneers is from six to fourteen years old, all of whom are students. In East Germany, elementary education is compulsory. The age of the Youth League is from fourteen to twenty-one; the age of student league members can be extended to twenty-four. These people are of course the masters of the new Germany. Their ability to absorb new ideas is very high. When Hitler began to move towards destruction and Germany was finally defeated, the twelve- or thirteen-year-old teenagers are now young people in their twenties. Today's Young Pioneers were just babies or kindergarten children at that time! They learned new educational methods from the Soviet Union. "Children's Homes" have been established in major cities. The Youth League implements a strict study plan. Hert told me that the education of young people is centered on cultivating internationalism and new labor viewpoints. They are studying the history of the Soviet revolutionary struggle, the history of the German revolutionary struggle, and the biographies of heroic martyrs who sacrificed themselves. The youth of the German Democratic Republic are very active. During the general election in October, they were mainly responsible for conducting picketing and propaganda. They are also the backbone of the factory in launching production competitions, establishing tractor stations in the countryside, and clearing rubble on the streets. They care about the revolutionary struggle of people all over the world and have a particularly good impression of China. They praise the large population and vast land of China, admire the Chinese people for defeating domestic and foreign reactionaries and liberating the entire nation with their own strength, and admire the heroic actions of our volunteers resisting US aggression and aiding Korea.

　　I asked Hert that educating the people to liberate themselves from the ideological influence of the Nazis must be an extremely difficult task. He said: "You cannot ignore the collapse of the Nazis and the embarrassing and disastrous defeat in the last few months, which is a bloody education for every German. Reality destroyed the ideological shackles of the Nazis. But people were wandering, they were groping for new directions in life. With the help of the Soviet Union, the Socialist Unity Party pointed out a new and bright path of life for the German people. Their lives have slowly stabilized and are improving every day. At the same time, they have not been subjected to the slave treatment of the conquered people as imagined; all of these are not propaganda slogans, but—as you have seen with your own eyes these past two days—what they have personally experienced. In 1946 and 1947, you would meet some dejected people lamenting: 'This time, the Germans are finished! Everything is over!' But in 1950, these people are less common. People are the most realistic." He also said that in West Germany, the Americans gave people who were wandering another direction: the direction of continuing the national hatred that Hitler stirred up after the First World War, the direction of revenge, but in real life, US imperialism brought the people of West Germany a hungry and degrading slave life.

　　In West Berlin, under the occupation of imperialist troops, the number of unemployed workers has approached 400,000. Young women are forced by life to engage in prostitution, waiting for customers in the brightly lit streets of West Berlin. These young women, if they were in East Germany, would become members of the Free German Youth League or active members of factories. Advertising for prostitution, standing about one zhang tall, is openly erected on the streets of West Berlin. Unemployed young men are peddling black market American cigarettes to passers-by. Young children perform tumbling tricks to earn money for food. The stores are filled with luxury goods from the United States, nylon stockings, Hollywood lipstick... but they are deserted and have no customers. West Germany produces far more coal than East Germany, but this winter, people in West Berlin have to come to the east to buy coal. Not only do ordinary people feel a shortage of coal for heating, but even factory production is affected by the coal shortage. Sugar factories, textile factories, farm implement manufacturing factories, bakeries, and gas factories in West Germany are either closing down one after another or reducing production, and batches of workers are being pushed into the ranks of the unemployed. Where has the coal gone? The coal production in the Ruhr has not decreased, the coal has been monopolized by the West German military industry, and the coal has been forcibly exported in large quantities by the US imperialists to produce munitions in Western European countries. But the US imperialists turned around and falsely announced that they were prepared to ship 500,000 tons of coal from the United States to solve the coal shortage in West Germany. But if you calculate it, this American coal costs US$16.50 per ton, while the price of Ruhr coal is only US$10 per ton!

　　The people of Germany hate US imperialism and do not want to be cannon fodder for the aggressors again. This is the definite conclusion I have drawn from my four days of observation.

　　The German people have widely launched a struggle to win peace and oppose rearmament; the call of the German National Front and the Socialist Unity Party to strive for the democratic reunification of the motherland is so loud and deeply rooted in the hearts of the people that it has become the unified goal of struggle for all the German people.

　　As I left Berlin, I couldn't help but cheer for the great future of the German people and the victory of their struggle for peace and the reunification of their motherland!

　　德国人民要求和平、民主、统一！
    民主柏林四日记
    钟怀
    得到一个机会，我去民主柏林作了四天的旅行。在一九五○年十二月三日的早晨，我乘火车离开了布拉格。
    沿着捷德边境，一路风景十分秀丽。天是蔚蓝的，和铁道几乎平行的碧绿的易北河水在静静地流着。岸旁，成排的红色房顶、灰白色砖墙的小巧精致的房屋，点缀着被丛林密密地盖着的山脚。虽然是初冬了，草地依然是绿油油的。这似乎是欧洲童话里描写的画面，很难令人相信这就是当年纳粹进攻欧洲时首当其冲的苏台德区。到了德累斯登，景象截然不同了。沿路一片断墙残壁；从车站望入市区，被炸后的钢骨水泥房屋的骷髅远远地排列成行。和我同坐在一个车厢里的德国老人用生硬的英文叹息着说：“你看，这就是战争！这就是战争！”
    到柏林时，天色已晚，我被朋友们接待到德意志民主共和国的招待所歇宿。我的房间在三层楼，面向大街，推开窗，可以看见前面有一个小小的空场；横过大街是一片瓦砾，一片废墟；但却有明亮的灯光照耀着。环绕着四周是一条轻便铁路，许多工人在忙着敲砖击石。朋友们告诉我，空场是以前以俾斯麦为名的广场，现在为了纪念德意志民族优秀的儿子、劳动人民的领袖、被法西斯强盗囚禁十年而终被杀死在集中营里的台尔曼，而改名了。那一堆瓦砾就是有八公尺深的地下室的希特勒总部了。民主柏林市政府正在拆毁和清除废墟，准备在这法西斯死亡的坟地上重建人民的新楼房。
    直到我睡的时候，敲砖头，搬卸东西的声音还在一片寂静中起伏着。在柏林的第一夜，是充满了交错复杂的印象的：和平的美好，战争的灾难；法西斯的死亡，新生活的重建。
    在柏林的短促几天中，我尽量访问、参观，和朋友们谈话，希望得到一些对久已存在的问题的答案。我时常想知道德国老百姓在纳粹崩溃后，对过去、现在和将来究竟怎样看法？他们对国家被分为两个对立的区域有何感想？他们还要战争吗？东德和西德的生活有什么不同？
    我在柏林的时候，统一社会党机关报《新德意志》报正刊载了德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥十二月一日给《波恩政府》总理阿登纳的一封信，信里提出请阿登纳共同促进德国统一的建议。朋友们向我解释，自从十月二十一日布拉格八国外长会议提出了由东西德选出同等数目的代表组织全德立宪会议，成立统一政府之后，德国政治上起了重大的转变。布拉格会议的精神，在东德各地的群众大会中作了广泛的解释和宣传。十月二十六日，统一社会党召开中央全会，总书记乌布利希声明准备和西德的代表同在一个桌子上谈判德国统一的问题。他说：“我相信在西德政府领袖中一定不乏不受英美影响、能为德国着想的人士。”他指出，布拉格会议给德国人民打开了一个美好的前途，让他们自己决定国家的命运。德意志民主共和国并不认为将来统一的德国就一定是以她为模型的德国；东西德双方都应作让步。“波恩政府”对东德建议的反应竟是一片谩骂，说什么诚意统一等等都是宣传口号。但是广大的西德的人民却是非常热烈地拥护祖国民主统一的建议的。
    一般说来，西德人民对布拉格会议的印象很深刻。德意志民主共和国的代表以平等身份出席国际会议，和苏联的代表坐在一起商讨大局，对德国人民是很大的兴奋。祖国的分裂意味着战争。美占领军高级专员麦克洛埃曾说过朝鲜“事件”可能在德国演出，这一无耻的叫嚣引起了西德人民强烈的反对。虽然在美占领军和傀儡阿登纳政府的高压之下，西德的工人依然热烈地进行着拥护布拉格会议的签名运动。全德基督教权威领袖尼米勒（在西德）公开表示，无条件地赞成统一，即使这个统一是在“无神论的共产党领导下的”。跟着，基督教徒召开全体代表大会，通过决议，一致赞成统一德国和反对重整武装。
    民主德意志的行动处处都是为实现和平统一而铺平道路。去年十月十五日，全共和国大选，同时选举人民议会，各州、各市区议会，但在民主柏林却没有进行选举。他们的解释是：“柏林不属于任何一方的，她只能是将来统一、民主德国的首都。”选举后，十一月八日，人民议会通过格罗提渥任总理，十五日正式结束以前的临时政府，成立新政府，在施政纲领里明确地提出布拉格会议的决定是新政府施政的主要方向。格罗提渥在十二月一日写信给阿登纳，表示愿诚恳地和西德政府代表共商统一大事。而大柏林市长艾伯特也在民主柏林市政府成立二周年纪念日——十一月三十日写信给西柏林市长路透，重申全国阵线二十五日向苏、美、英、法占领军当局的建议，先统一柏林，后统一德国，并定于明年（即一九五一年）三月在全柏林举行民主自由选举。对全国阵线的建议，苏联管制委员会很迅速就回信表示赞成了；美、英、法的答复则是决不考虑这个建议。十二月二日西柏林市长也正式表示拒绝艾伯特的建议。十二月三日，西柏林竟单独进行选举。
    德国人要战争吗？在参观工厂的时候，我曾问过不少工人对战争的看法。在民主柏林郊外的炼钢管的西门子——披阑尼亚工厂，女劳动英雄杜鲁达·邵尔卡告诉我，他的丈夫是犹太人，在战争中死在集中营；她的儿子今年二十三岁了，由于少年失学，战后跟她在厂里一面学习文化，一面做工。杜鲁达常常为了儿子过去失学而伤心。她问我：“你说我会要战争吗？”我向同厂的另外两个女工问同样的问题，一个说：“战争对我是一个丈夫的死亡，一个孩子的被杀害啊！”另一个告诉我：“丈夫在战争中失踪了！”（替我作翻译的工厂文化指导员告诉我，美帝国主义者故意保留一部分伤亡德军的名单而不发表，诬称这些人是被苏联关在集中营里不放的，企图以此卑鄙方法煽动反苏情绪。这个女工的丈夫正是美军所制造的“失踪”的一个）陪同我参观的是二十二岁的哥尔特·赫格特，自由德国青年联盟的干部，他的父母都在战争中死亡了，剩下他一个人。他说许多和他同年龄的青年都是没有家的。
    在柏林街头所看见的多半是老年男女，或是妇女。妇女在重工业的许多生产部门和男子一样做工；街上的交通警察也是妇女担任。赫尔特告诉我，在柏林市二十到三十岁的人口中，男的仅占百分之三十。
    从东柏林来看，市区的破坏是异常重大的。昔日被称为柏林橱窗的菩提树下街，到处是瓦砾、断墙，房屋的骷髅；画廊、博物馆、大学，都只剩下外边的围墙，和若干未被炸损的雕刻。虽然新兴的房屋到处可见，但对一个新来柏林的旅客，战争的破坏依然是很触目的。
    战争遗留下的瓦砾尚未扫除，现在又谈战争。德国人民包括天天在美帝恶毒宣传下的西德人民，自然是激烈反对的。十一月底，西德举行的大选结果，对人民反战的情绪提供了有力的证明。舒马赫的社会民主党以反对重整武装的口号骗取了众多的选票。他向选民宣称：假使他们不投票选社会民主党，而选阿登纳的党，国际上的了解即认为是他们拥护备战的表示。在传统上为反动的天主教民主党盘据的巴伐里亚区，社会民主党的选票超过天主教党所得的选票。虽然反战的德国人民是上了第二国际的伪君子舒马赫的当，但是他们热烈要求和平的情绪是充分表达出来了。
    东德和西德，宛然是两个世界。东西柏林的对比，正是两个德国的缩影。
    整个柏林东西长约一百华里，苏军占领区——通常称为民主区——约占三分之一。人口比例亦相当于此，民主柏林约有人口一百二十万。两个区域平时可以自由来往，交界处也没有人看守，但是人们是很容易知道那里是民主区，那里是西占区。
    在民主柏林，新的房屋在建筑着，旧的在被拆毁中。工人住宅，百货商店，一排一排的现代化楼房已经代替了三四年前的废墟。我住的招待所所址，是被炸毁了的过去希特勒常去的旅馆旧地；右边的簇新大厦——现在全国阵线总部——原来是夷为平地的戈培尔的宣传部旧址。在菩提树下街的中心，富丽的楼房已经有几所接近完工了。赫尔特说，在柏林市五年计划中，这个区域将成为政府机关和各国使馆的集中地，“我们要把这块地方重新恢复为新柏林的橱窗。”
    在民主柏林街上遛达，很容易看见“Ｈ·Ｏ·”的招牌。赫尔特告诉我，自从一九四八年起，购物不需要配给票了，可以在自由市场购买。“Ｈ·Ｏ”是国营的商店——自由市场。十二月六日上午我们去民主柏林最大的“Ｈ·Ｏ”，到达时离它开门营业的时间尚差两分钟，门前拥挤着五六百人在等候。进去了，我到处浏览，从面包、巧克力部看到呢绒、花布、绸缎部；从儿童玩具部到无线电收音机、唱片、书籍文具部，再到香水化妆品部，货物应有尽有，而且品质非常好，都是德国自制的国货。
    民主柏林人民的购买力一般是高的，普通工人的工资在三百马克上下，熟练的约在四百五十左右。面包每公斤○·八马克。一个没有家庭负担的工人，食物占他的收入百分之二十弱；一个有两个五六岁孩子负担的母亲，她用在食物方面约占收入百分之六十，房租百分之十。我问汉尼斯朵夫炼钢厂的工人，收入是否够用。他们告诉我，对付日常衣、食、住是足够的，但是假如要添置一些新的家具，或是一件御寒的大氅，就得积蓄一个时候了。一个五十来岁、满脸煤灰、茁壮的工人，郑重地告我：“不容易啊！这是战后啊！”
    工人宿舍是整洁的公寓房子，工厂里设有托儿所、幼稚园；规模较大的厂有小学、为青年工人而设的青工学校、工人文化宫；离城市较远的工厂有自设的“Ｈ·Ｏ”。在民主柏林，工人过着美好的生活，在那里没有失业，而许多西柏林的失业工人也在东柏林的工厂找到了工作。
    今天民主德国的农村是一幅丰衣足食的图画，农民要求文化娱乐生活的提高。东德的土地，超过一百公顷的已经平分了，每人约得五公顷。德国的农村在战争中受到的破坏远不如城市的严重，战后苏联的机器和拖拉机广泛地在农村中应用，农民之间组织了互助组，农村的生产很快地在增加。
    在东德，青年和儿童是最幸福的了。青年有自己的组织——自由德国青年联盟。赫尔特告诉我，参加青联人数与少年先锋队一起已有三百万；其中妇女占三分之一。少先队的年龄是从六岁到十四岁，全部是学生。在东德，小学教育是强迫的。青联的年龄是从十四到二十一；学生盟员的年龄可以延展到二十四岁。这些人当然是新德国的主人翁了。他们吸收新思想的能力是很高的。在希特勒开始走向灭亡以至德国战败的时候，十二三岁的少年，现在正是二十上下的青年。今天的少年先锋队员在那时还只是婴孩或是幼稚园的孩子咧！从苏联，他们学习了新的教育方法。各大城市都建立了“儿童之家”。青年联盟执行着严格的学习计划。赫尔特告诉我，青年们的教育是以培养国际主义和新的劳动观点为中心。他们在学习苏联革命斗争史，德国革命斗争史和英勇牺牲了的烈士传记。德意志民主共和国的青年是非常活跃的。十月大选的时候，执行纠察，进行宣传，都是以他们为主。工厂发动生产竞赛热潮，去农村创办拖拉机站，在街头清理瓦砾，他们也是中坚分子。他们关心全世界人民的革命斗争事业，对中国特别具有好感。他们赞美中国人口的众多，土地的广大，敬佩中国人民以自己的力量打败了国内外的反动派而解放了全民族，对于我国志愿抗美援朝的英勇行动更是敬仰不已。
    我问赫尔特，教育人民从纳粹的思想影响下解放出来，一定是一件极艰巨的工作。他说：“你不能忽视纳粹的崩溃和最后几个月的狼狈惨败，这对每一个德国人是血的教育。现实毁灭了纳粹的思想枷锁。但是人们彷徨了，他们在摸索新的生活方向。在苏联的帮助下，统一社会党给德国人民指出了一条新生的光明的道路。他们的生活慢慢地安定下来，而且每天在改善，同时他们并没有受到想像中的被征服人民的奴隶待遇；所有这些都不是宣传口号，而是——正如你这两天亲眼所见的——他们切身经验体会到的。在一九四六、四七年，你会遇到一些垂头丧气的人嗟叹着：‘这回，德国人完了！一切都完了！’但是在一九五○年，这种人就比较少见了。人民是最现实的。”他又说，在西德美国人却给在彷徨中的人们另一种方向：继续希特勒在第一次大战后煽动的民族仇恨的方向，复仇的方向，而在现实生活中，美帝国主义带给西德人民是饥寒和堕落的奴隶生活。
    西柏林在帝国主义军队占领下，失业工人已接近四十万。青年妇女为生活所逼，操着皮肉生涯，在西柏林灯火辉煌的街头巷尾，等候着顾客。这些女青年，若在东德是会成为自由德国青年联盟的盟员或是工厂里的积极分子的。西柏林街上公开竖着高约一丈的卖淫广告。失学失业的青年男子在向行人兜售黑市美国香烟。少年儿童耍翻筋斗的把戏，以博取吃饭的钱。商店里充斥着来自美国的奢侈品，玻璃丝袜、好莱坞唇膏………但是却冷清清地没有主顾。西德产煤远较东德为丰，今年冬天西柏林的人却要到东边来买煤。不仅是老百姓取暖感到缺煤，连工厂生产也因煤荒而受到影响。西德的制糖厂、纺织厂、农具制造厂、面包房、瓦斯工厂，或是纷纷倒闭，或是在减缩生产，成批的工人被推入失业者的行列里去。煤到那里去了呢？鲁尔的产煤并没有减少，煤被西德军火工业霸占了，煤被美帝强迫大量廉价出口，运往西欧各国去生产军火去了。美帝却回过头来假惶惶地宣布它准备从美国运五十万吨煤来解决西德的煤荒。但是算一算，这种美国煤一吨要美金十六元五角，鲁尔的煤价才是每吨美金十元啊！
    德国的人民痛恨美帝国主义，不愿再当侵略者的炮灰，是我四天的观察所得到的肯定的结论。
    德国人民已经广泛地展开了争取和平、反对重新武装的斗争；德意志全国阵线和统一社会党的争取祖国民主统一的号召是那样响亮而深入人心，已成为全德人民一致奋斗的目标。
    在我离开柏林的时候，我不禁要为德国人民的伟大前途及其争取和平与祖国统一的斗争的胜利而欢呼！
