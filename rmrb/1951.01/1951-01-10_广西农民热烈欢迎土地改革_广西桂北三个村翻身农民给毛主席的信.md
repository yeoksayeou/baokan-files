Guangxi Peasants Warmly Welcome Land Reform
-- Letter to Chairman Mao from Emancipated Peasants in Three Villages in Northern Guangxi

Editor's Note: Nine counties in the Guibei area of Guangxi Province began land reform in the winter of 1950, and some typical experimental villages were successfully completed by mid-December. The three villages in northern Guangxi that sent this letter were among the first to complete land reform. Their letter is filled with the soaring emotions of Southern peasants celebrating their emancipation.

Our Great Savior, Dear Chairman Mao:

For thousands of years, we have been oppressed by feudal forces, treated like cattle and horses. No one has ever been able to solve our suffering. Only the Communist Party, led by Chairman Mao, who is like the red sun, has carried out decades of bloody struggle to rescue us from the dark hell, eliminate our suffering for thousands of years, and lead us to genuine emancipation.

Dear Chairman Mao! When we mention our emancipation today, we can't help but think of the suffering of the past. In the past, we spent our lives from adulthood living a life of not having enough to eat or wear. We toiled from dawn till dark, from the first day of the first lunar month to the thirtieth night of the twelfth lunar month, working hard all year to harvest grain. But even when our own pants were torn, we didn't dare to buy some cloth to patch them. We had to bow our heads and carry the grain, load after load, to the landlord's house. After paying the debts and rent, we didn't even have enough rice in our house to make porridge. In the winter, we had to go out again to beg for food. When spring came, we had to rush to find seeds and fertilizer; at this time, the landlords became even more ruthless, increasing rent, seizing tenancies, and lending at usurious rates, using all kinds of cruel and vicious means to exploit us. The Kuomintang reactionary government did not care about the lives of the peasants at all, conscripting soldiers, requisitioning labor, levying grain, and apportioning funds, making us truly wish we were dead rather than alive! In 1949, when we heard that the People's Liberation Army had crossed the Yangtze River, many of us waited and waited, our eyes aching. Because we knew that Chairman Mao was wholeheartedly working for us laboring peasants. On the third day of the tenth lunar month, the People's Liberation Army really came. Look how happy we peasants were! Setting off firecrackers, pouring tea, and busily helping our army find rice and vegetables. The People's Liberation Army spoke to us very kindly, singing songs to us, singing: "The sky in the liberated area is a bright sky." We all clapped our hands and laughed. Later, we helped the People's Liberation Army repair roads, carry sleepers, and deliver pre-borrowed military rice. The People's Liberation Army spent several months wiping out bandits in our area. By March 1950, the local area had gradually calmed down, and we organized peasant associations, united, and resolutely fought against the landlords, implementing rent reduction. The landlords saw that we had strength and did not dare to resist. We recovered a lot of grain, which solved our difficulties in spring plowing. With enough to eat, we stepped up production and opened up a lot of wasteland. We also cooperated with the People's Liberation Army to eliminate bandits and special agents. After the autumn harvest, our peasant associations led the struggle to reduce rent from the landlords. We reduced rent according to policy, and we also paid rent to the landlords according to policy. Every family had grain, and everyone selected the best to pay public grain. In a few days, the public grain was prepared. We beat drums and gongs, twisted and sang, happily going to deliver public grain. The teams delivering public grain from each village, ah, looking ahead and behind, were a sea of people, and in the middle were countless carrying poles and baskets. The public grain was quickly delivered in full. Later, we all asked the government to implement land reform in our area. The government understood the situation in our area and the level of awareness of the masses, and accepted our request. On the tenth day of the ninth lunar month, several cadres came from the government to help us carry out land reform. We were so happy to see them! We discussed things together, sometimes forgetting to eat. On the one hand, we studied the policy of land reform, recognizing the exploitation of the landlords; on the other hand, we reorganized the peasant association and organized a peasant representative conference. We carefully divided classes, united the poor and hired peasants with the middle peasants, and resolutely struggled against the landlord class. We confiscated the landlords' land, farm tools, houses, and surplus grain, and gave them the share they deserved. After the confiscation was completed, everyone said that distributing the fruits of victory was our own internal affair, and we should distribute it amicably. We measured, divided the land, divided the houses, divided the farm tools, and divided the grain. Everyone was busy day and night. By the middle of the eleventh lunar month, this great happy event was successfully completed.

The peasants of Baiqiao Village received a total of 110 mu of paddy fields, 52 houses, 6耕牛, and 7,500 jin of grain, as well as various farm tools.

In Yanxiang Village, a total of 192 households, 115 households of poor peasants with no or little land received land.

We are happy, joyful, and unspeakably happy.

Our Qihe Village also held a victory meeting for the return of land to its owners. At the meeting, everyone wanted to write a letter to thank our dear Chairman Mao and to report the good news to Chairman Mao. Everyone said one sentence or another, telling our dear Chairman Mao what was in their hearts.

The Great Savior of the People, Dear Chairman Mao: From now on, we will no longer be oppressed by feudal landlords. We will work hard to produce, be diligent and thrifty, and support the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army in repelling the American imperialist aggression in Korea with practical actions. We will defend our fruits of victory, and we will always follow the victorious red flag forward! We shout:

Long live Chairman Mao!
Long live the Chinese Communist Party!
Long live the laboring people of the world!

Qihe Village
Respectfully submitted by all the peasants of Yanxiang Village, Guibei, Guangxi
Baiqiao Village
December 20, 1950

### 广西农民热烈欢迎土地改革——广西桂北三个村翻身农民给毛主席的信

　　广西农民热烈欢迎土地改革
    ——广西桂北三个村翻身农民给毛主席的信
    编者按：广西省桂北区已有九个县于一九五○年冬开始进行土地改革，一部分典型实验村，在十二月中旬即已胜利完成。来信的桂北三个村，就是最先完成土地改革的村庄。他们的信充满了南方农民欢庆翻身的高涨情绪。中国人民的大救星、亲爱的毛主席：
    数千年来，我们受封建势力的压迫，当牛、当马，从来没有人能解决我们的痛苦，只有红日一般的毛主席共产党，进行了几十年的流血斗争，才把我们从黑暗的地狱中救出来了，把我们几千年来的痛苦除掉了，领导我们真正翻了身。
    亲爱的毛主席！提到今天的翻身，我们不由得又想起过去的痛苦。我们过去成年到辈过着吃不饱、穿不暖的生活。我们从天明忙到夜黑，我们从正月初一到腊月三十夜晚，辛辛苦苦一年收获了谷子。可是，我们自己的裤子破了，也不敢买些布回来补。我们都得低下头，把谷子一担一担送到地主的屋子里。等还了账，交了租，我们屋里连熬稀粥的米都不多了。到冬天，我们又得出去跑闹挣饭吃。到了开春，又要急着找种籽和肥料；这时地主更狠起心，加租呀，夺佃呀，放高利贷呀，向咱们施展种种剥皮抽筋的毒辣手段。国民党反动政府更是不顾农民的死活，征兵、征工，征粮、派款，弄得咱真是愿死不愿活了！到了一九四九年，听到说人民解放军过了长江，咱们好多人等着等着，真是把眼睛都望痛了。因为咱们知道，毛主席是全心全意为我们劳动农民办事的。到了农历十月初三，人民解放军真来了。你看咱们农民是多么欢喜啊！放炮的放炮，倒茶的倒茶，忙着帮助咱们的军队找米找菜。解放军很和气地同我们谈话，给我们唱歌，唱的是：“解放区的天，是明朗的天。”我们听了都拍手大笑。后来，我们帮助解放军修马路，抬道木，送预借军米。解放军在我们这里一连剿了几个月的土匪，到了一九五零年三月，地方上逐渐平靖了，我们就组织了农民协会，团结起来，坚决向地主斗争，实行退租。地主看到我们有了力量，也不敢反抗了。咱们退回了好多谷子，解决了我们春耕的困难。我们有了吃的，就加劲生产，开了好多荒地。我们又配合解放军，消灭土匪特务。到了秋收后，咱们农民协会又领导着向地主进行减租斗争，我们按政策减了租，也按政策给地主交了租子。我们各家都有了谷子，大家都选出好的交纳公粮，不几天就把公粮准备齐了，我们打起锣鼓，扭着，唱着，欢欢喜喜地去送公粮。各村送公粮的队伍呵，前后看人山人海，中间看数不完的扁担箩筐，公粮很快就上齐了。后来，我们大家向政府要求，说我们这地方要实行土地改革才好。政府了解到我们这地方的情形和群众的觉悟程度，就接受了我们的要求。到了农历九月初十，政府就来了几个干部，帮助我们进行土地改革。我们看见他们来了，好高兴呵！我们在一起商量事情，有时候连饭都忘记吃了。我们一方面学习土地改革的政策，认清了地主的剥削；一方面整理农会，组织农代会。我们认真地划分了阶级，贫雇农团结中农，坚决向地主阶级斗争。我们没收了地主的土地、农具、房屋和多余的粮食，并给他们应得的一份。没收完了，大家都说，分配胜利果实是我们自己内部的事，我们要和和气气地分。我们丈量、划分土地、分房子、分农具、分粮食，大家日夜忙个不停，到农历十一月中旬，这件大喜事就胜利完成了。
    我们白桥屯的农民共得到水田一百一十亩，房屋五十二间，耕牛六只，粮食七千五百斤，还有各种农具。
    我们延祥村总共一百九十二户，就有一百一十五户无田、少田的贫苦农民分得了田地。
    我们欢呀，喜呀，我们欢天喜地，说不尽的快乐。
    我们七合村还举行了土地还家的胜利大会。在大会上，大家要写信感谢咱亲爱的毛主席，给毛主席报喜讯。大家就你一句，我一句，向亲爱的毛主席说出自己心里的话。
    人民的大救星、亲爱的毛主席：从今以后我们再也不受封建地主的压迫了，我们要努力生产，要勤俭节约，要以实际行动支援在朝鲜击退美帝侵略的中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军，我们要保卫自己的胜利果实，我们要永远跟着胜利的红旗前进！我们高呼：
    毛主席万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    天下劳动人民万岁！
                      七合村
              广西桂北延祥村全体农民敬启
                      白桥屯
                一九五零年十二月二十日
