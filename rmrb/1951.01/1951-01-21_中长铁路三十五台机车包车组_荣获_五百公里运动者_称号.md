　　Thirty-Five Locomotive Package Groups of the China Changchun Railway
    Awarded the Title of "Five Hundred Kilometer Movement Advocates"
    [Reported by this newspaper] Since the China Changchun Railway Bureau fully launched the 500-kilometer daily locomotive movement in June last year, over the past six months, 35 locomotives and 105 drivers have been awarded the honorary title of "Five Hundred Kilometer Movement Advocates." The "500-kilometer movement" has improved the efficiency of locomotive use and accelerated vehicle turnover, thereby reducing railway transportation costs. Especially since the formulation of the production and financial plan, the "500-kilometer movement" has played its due role even more. In the past five months, the daily locomotive kilometerage has increased by 24.5 kilometers, the locomotive turnaround time has been shortened by 18 to 36 minutes, and freight locomotives have saved 510.5 locomotive days compared to the production and financial plan. The main reason why the employees of the "500-kilometer movement" locomotive package groups have been able to achieve results is that they have strengthened contact with dispatching workers and made a good daily locomotive routing plan. For example, the crew of the No. 755 package group of the Mudanjiang Locomotive Depot seized the time of the train schedule, only took on water once at the turnout station during the journey, and compressed the dwell time outside the section. They completed a technical speed of 42.7 kilometers in only 20 minutes, and on November 12th of last year, they created a maximum record of 772.5 daily locomotive kilometers. The driver captains of the 35 locomotive "500-kilometer movement advocates" are: Wang Jikui, Li Shoushan, Wang Yulin, Wang Qingli, Qi Yintang, Sun Shigui, Ge Chun'an, Zhao Zhong, Yu Jiye, Yu Bin, Han Tongzhong, Sun Xiangting, Guo Songren, He Shixiang, Liu Baochen, Cao Jinghe, Yang Sheng, Han Zhenming, Jiang Wenlin, Xie Ruiqi, Hao Tingren, Fu Tiansui, Li Huishan, Gong Puhou, Liu Fangqi, Li Wenfu, Zhu Guozhang, Han Junduo, Cao Jinghou, Wang Shulin, Zheng Xikun, Li Zhenjia, Bi Honglin, Wang Changlin, and Sun Dequan. Also, all car and machine dispatchers of the Third Branch Bureau. The China Changchun Railway Bureau has awarded the above-mentioned locomotive package groups and car and machine dispatchers the honorary title of "Five Hundred Kilometer Movement Advocates" and issued bonuses.

　　中长铁路三十五台机车包车组
    荣获“五百公里运动者”称号
    【本报讯】中长铁路局从去年六月全面开展日车五百公里运动后，半年多以来，已有三十五台机车、一○五位司机荣获“五百公里运动者”的光荣称号。“五百公里运动”，提高了机车使用效率，加速了车辆周转，也就减低了铁路运输成本。特别是从编制生产财务计划以后，“五百公里运动”更发挥了它的应有作用。五个月以来，机车日车公里提高了二四·五公里，机车周转时间缩短了十八分到三十六分，货运机车较生产财务计划节省了五一○·五台（机车日）。“五百公里运动者”机车包车组员工能以取得成绩的主要原因是，加强了与调度工作者的联系，作好当日机车交路计划。如牡丹江机务段七五五号包车组乘务员抓紧了行车时刻，中途只在开道站上了一次水，并压缩自外段停留时间，只用二十分钟完成了四二·七公里的技术速度，于去年十一月十二日创出了七七二·五日车公里的最高纪录。三十五台机车“五百公里运动者”的司机长是：王吉奎、李守山、王玉林、王清立、祁荫棠、孙士贵、葛春安、赵忠、于基业、于滨、韩统忠、孙相廷、郭松仁、何世祥、刘宝臣、曹景和、杨升、韩振明、姜文林、谢瑞琪、郝廷仁、傅天绥、李会山、龚普厚、刘芳岐、李文甫、朱国璋、韩钧铎、曹景厚、王树林、郑锡坤、李振家、毕洪林、王长林、孙德全。还有三分局车、机全体调度员。中长铁路局已对上述机车包车组和车、机调度员授予了“五百公里运动者”的光荣称号，并发给了奖金。
