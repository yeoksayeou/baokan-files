　　Resolutely Oppose the United States' Rearmament of Japan

　　The United States' plot to rearm Japan has aroused serious attention and opposition from the Chinese people. On the 25th of this month, the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs held a forum to oppose the U.S. arming of Japan. This newspaper also published an editorial on January 28 entitled "Crush the U.S. Plot to Rearm Japan and Strive for a Comprehensive and Just Peace Treaty with Japan." More than 40,000 women in Beijing held a demonstration parade on the 28th, raising high the banner of "Oppose Arming Japan" and issuing a solemn call to battle to women across China, Asia, and the world.

　　It is natural that Chinese women are the first to express their resolute opposition to the U.S. rearming of Japan, because the disasters inflicted on the Chinese people by Japanese imperialism since September 18, 1931, have been too profound. The people of the whole country still have fresh memories of the suffering inflicted on China by Japanese imperialism. During the Japanese invasion of China, many important cities in our country were bombed by Japanese invaders. Especially in the Liberated Areas at that time, Japanese imperialism carried out the brutal "Three Alls Policy" (kill all, burn all, loot all), creating horrifying "no-man's-lands." Beautiful homes became scorched earth, and hardworking people were arbitrarily slaughtered. Some parents were killed, and orphans cried in the rubble. They also arbitrarily breached dikes, inundating vast fields and villages... In short, Japanese imperialism created countless disasters in China.

　　After eight years of arduous resistance, the Chinese people finally defeated the Japanese invaders, defeating the most vicious enemy of China for half a century.

　　Now, the United States is attempting to rearm Japan and continue its aggression against China. The Chinese people absolutely cannot ignore this. For our safety, to defend our cities, to defend our compatriots, to defend our farms... we should unite and resolutely oppose this criminal plot by the United States to rearm Japan.

The well was filled with corpses, a one-inch-thick layer of blood congealed on the ground in the courtyard, and corpses lay across the road. Corpses were everywhere in five major massacre sites. More than twenty naked female corpses lay in one courtyard, and seven cellars were filled with dead people. Children were burned to death inside caves. More than sixty women were stripped naked and beheaded, and their hearts were dug out and eaten. The wombs of pregnant women were cut open and the fetuses taken out. This was an unprecedented massacre!

More than a thousand villagers were whipped and driven into a large courtyard. The courtyard was piled with anything that could be ignited, machine guns were mounted on the roof, and enemy soldiers stood on the walls. The entire village, old and young, was driven into the courtyard, the gate was closed, and machine guns were used to fire into the dense crowd. Sulfur bombs set the entire courtyard ablaze. Almost all the villagers were buried in gunfire and flames. A total of 1,035 people died, including 658 women and children, and 84 were seriously injured. More than 30 families were martyred, and 1,100 houses were burned down.
　　10. In May 1943, in Beiqi Village, Yixian County, Hebei Province, the Japanese invaders surrounded more than 40 of our compatriots and forced them to jump into a well with bayonets. Those who did not jump were immediately stabbed to death. After they jumped, large stones were thrown in, turning the well into a blood well. Only two people were rescued alive.

　　坚决反对美国重新武装日本
    美国重新武装日本的阴谋，已经引起中国人民严重的注意与反对，本月二十五日中国人民外交学会已经举行了反对美国武装日本的座谈会，本报于一月二十八日也发表了《粉碎美国重新武装日本的阴谋，争取全面的公正的对日和约》的社论，北京妇女四万余人并于二十八日举行了示威大游行，她们鲜明地高举着“反对武装日本”的旗帜，向全中国、全亚洲和全世界的妇女们发出了庄严的战斗的号召。
    中国妇女对于美国重新武装日本首先表示坚决的反对，是很自然的。因为自一九三一年九月十八日以来，日本帝国主义所加于中国人民的灾难太深重了。全国人民对于日本帝国主义所加于中国的苦难，至今记忆犹新；在日本侵华战争中，我国许多重要城市被日寇轰炸，特别在当时解放区，日本帝国主义进行了残暴的“三光政策”造成了惨绝人寰的“无人区”，美丽的家园成为焦土，，勤劳的人民被任意屠杀，有些父母被杀之后，孤儿在瓦砾场中啼哭，他们又任意决堤淹没了广大的田园和村庄，……总之日本帝国主义在中国制造了数不清的灾难。
    经过了八年艰苦的抗战，中国人民才战胜了日寇，打倒了中国半世纪来最凶恶的敌人。
    现在，美国又企图重新武装起日本，继续侵略中国，中国人民对此绝对不能漠视。为了我们的安全，为了保卫我们城市，为了保卫我们同胞，为了保卫我们的田庄，……我们应当团结起来，坚决反对美国重新武装日本这一罪恶阴谋。（附图片）
