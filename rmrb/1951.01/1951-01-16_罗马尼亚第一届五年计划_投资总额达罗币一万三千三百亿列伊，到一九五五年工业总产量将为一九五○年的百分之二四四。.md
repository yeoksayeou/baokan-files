　　The total investment for the Five-Year Plan is 133 billion lei (approximately 221.6 billion yuan RMB). Of the 684 billion lei invested in industry, 560 billion will be used to develop industries that manufacture the means of production. The plan stipulates that by 1955, the total industrial output will be 244% of the 1950 level; the production of electric motors will increase fivefold; the production of transformers will increase fourfold; the power generation capacity will reach 1.7 million kilowatts; the oil production will reach 10 million tons, an increase of 80% compared to 1950; coal production will exceed the pre-war level by 3.3 times; steel production will reach 1.252 million tons, four and a half times that of 1938; rolled metal will reach 828,000 tons, 2.6 times that of 1938; coke will reach 700,000 tons, eight times that of 1938; and iron ore will reach 740,000 tons, 5.3 times that of 1938. The production of machinery will exceed the 1950 level by 216%; the production of mining industrial equipment, tractors, and agricultural machinery will all be greatly increased. The output of chemical, construction, and various light industrial sectors will increase by two and a half times compared to 1950.

　　The plan also stipulates the establishment of collectivized agriculture based on the voluntary principle to gradually realize the socialist transformation of agriculture, so that the socialist part of agriculture will occupy a dominant position by the end of the Five-Year Plan, supplying the state with most of the needed grain, agricultural products, and industrial raw materials. The number of machine tractor stations will increase from 138 in 1950 to 428 in 1955, with a total of 28,000 tractors. The plan stipulates the establishment of a strong grain base and the expansion of the planting area for industrial crops, the development of livestock breeding, the improvement of breeding stock, and the increase of livestock productivity.

　　The plan also stipulates the development and strengthening of socialist trade to expand the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas and to strengthen the alliance between the working class and the peasantry. In 1955, goods worth 500 billion lei will be supplied to the people, an increase of 217% compared to 1950. The goods received in rural areas will increase by 112% compared to 1950.

　　In 1955, Romania's national income will exceed the 1938 level by 190%, and the material and cultural living standards of the working people will be further improved. Labor productivity will increase by 75% compared to 1950, production costs will be reduced by 23%, and the wage fund will increase by 66%. The number of workers, technicians, and staff will reach 3 million, with the number of industrial workers alone increasing by 570,000. School education and public health services will also be greatly developed.
