Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 18th: The Chongqing business community, after overcoming various difficulties, has successfully completed the tax payment task for 1950. The preparatory committee of the Chongqing Federation of Industry and Commerce, on behalf of the city's business community, sent an open letter to the business communities of six major cities, including Beijing and Tianjin, on the 15th, reporting the process of completing tax collection and calling on patriotic industrialists and businessmen in the aforementioned areas to encourage each other and actively pay taxes. The content of the letter is as follows:

To the Industrial and Commercial Circles of Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Hankou, Guangzhou, and Xi'an:

　　On New Year's Eve of 1950, we successfully completed the annual tax revenue task.

　　Before liberation, we suffered severe exploitation and damage under the long-term rule of the Chiang Kai-shek-American bandit gang. Around June 1949, the major cities across the country were liberated successively, and the Chiang Kai-shek-American bandit gang collapsed in a mess. A huge amount of counterfeit gold yuan notes flooded into Chongqing, draining and stealing the wealth and materials of the broad masses of people, causing the industrialists and businessmen of Chongqing to suffer unprecedented looting. Following that, the Kuomintang bandit gang created the terrible "September 2nd" fire, reducing Chongqing's prime areas to ashes. After liberation, the bandits and special agents pre-arranged by the Chiang Kai-shek-American bandit gang also used various vicious conspiracies to obstruct the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, seriously hindering the recovery and development of industry and commerce!

　　This is the specific situation of the industrial and commercial circles in Chongqing before and after liberation.

　　The industrialists and businessmen in Chongqing, due to the above-mentioned cruel devastation and persecution, and through learning and organizational life after liberation, have a greater understanding of the ferocity, insidiousness, and ugliness of the Chiang Kai-shek-American bandit gang; at the same time, we have a greater understanding of the lovability of the People's Motherland. After the movement to Resist America and Aid Korea and defend our homes and country was launched, we enthusiastically and conscientiously formulated patriotic covenants. In order to fully and concretely arrange our love for the motherland in practical actions, we specially listed "completing the tax revenue task" as the main content of the covenant.

　　We firmly believe that only by guaranteeing the supply of the war against aggression to enrich the country's economic strength can we defeat American imperialist aggression, carry out the country's peaceful construction, and the recovery, development, and prosperity of industry and commerce. Therefore, we have launched a tax payment upsurge and successfully completed the annual tax revenue task for 1950.

　　You are the progressive industrialists and businessmen of the advanced cities of New China, and you must have a clearer understanding of the tax issue than we do. Here, we faithfully report to you the situation of completing the tax payment task in the midst of difficulties, hoping that you will also tell us in detail about your practice of "patriotic covenants" and enthusiastic tax payment. Let us all unite closely under the banner of Chairman Mao, encourage each other, and work together to consolidate the country's economic front and enhance the actual strength of resisting America and aiding Korea!

　　重庆工商界致函六大城市工商界
    报告胜利完成去年纳税任务
    号召相互激励踊跃纳税增强抗美援朝实际力量
    【新华社重庆十八日电】重庆市工商界于克服各种困难后，胜利完成一九五零年纳税任务。重庆市工商业联合会筹备会为此代表全市工商界于十五日向北京、天津等六大城市发出一封公开信，报告完成税收经过，并号召上述各地爱国工商业者相互激励，踊跃纳税。信的内容如下：
    北京、天津、上海、汉口、广州、西安六大城市的工商界同人们：
    一九五零年除夕，我们已胜利完成了全年度的税收任务。
    解放以前，我们在蒋美匪帮长期统治下，遭受到严重的剥削和损害。一九四九年六月前后，全国各大城市相继解放，蒋美匪帮狼狈溃败，巨额的伪金元券潮涌似地集中在重庆，吸干并盗取了广大人民的财富和物资，使重庆的工商业者遭受空前未有的洗劫。跟着，国民党匪帮又制造了可怕的“九二”火灾，使重庆的精华区域付之一炬。解放以后，蒋美匪帮预先布置下的匪特又施展各种恶毒阴谋来阻挠城乡物资交流，严重妨碍了工商业的恢复和发展！
    这就是重庆解放前后工商业界的具体情况。
    重庆的工商业者，由于遭受了以上惨酷的摧残和迫害，又由于解放后通过了学习生活和组织生活，我们更加认识了蒋美匪帮的凶狠险毒和丑恶；同时也更加认识了人民祖国的可爱。抗美援朝保家卫国运动展开后，我们热烈地、认真地订立了爱国公约。为了把我们对祖国的热爱充分地、具体地布置在实际行动中，我们特别把“完成税收任务”列为公约的主要内容。
    我们深信：只有保障对反侵略战争的供给来充沛国家的经济力量，才能打败美帝的侵略，才能进行国家的和平建设和工商业的恢复、发展和繁荣。因此，我们掀起了纳税的热潮，胜利完成了一九五零年全年度的税收任务。
    你们是新中国先进城市的进步的工商业者，对于税收问题一定比我们认识的更清楚。这里，我们把从困难中完成税收任务的情况忠实地报告给你们，希望你们也把实践“爱国公约”和踊跃纳税的情况详细地告诉我们。让我们大家紧密地团结在毛主席的旗帜下，相互激励，共同为巩固国家的经济战线和增强抗美援朝的实际力量而奋斗！
                              重庆市工商业联合会筹备委员会
                                                一月十五日
