　　In the Yi Ethnic Region
    Mu Bing
    Editor's Note: The Xichang Special District of Xikang Province governs nine counties and four administrative bureaus, namely Xichang, Zhaojue, Ningnan, Dechang, Huali, Kuaibian, Kuaiyuan, Mianning, and Yuexi nine counties, Ningdong, Luning, Huangcao, and Puge four administrative bureaus. This area is locally referred to as Ningshu. It faces the Jinsha River to the south and leans against the Dadu River to the north. Various minority ethnic groups live together within its borders. Before liberation, the minority ethnic groups of Ningshu suffered long-term and brutal oppression by the Kuomintang and feudal forces. After liberation, thanks to the correct implementation of ethnic policies by Party, government, and military personnel, the minority ethnic brothers have changed their past attitude of hatred towards the Han people. What is published here are fragments of the daily life between our army and the Yi people, which can show that a close military-civilian relationship is growing in the Yi region.
  Testing the People’s Liberation Army
    "The Communist Party's ethnic policy is good, and the People's Liberation Army's political discipline is good." This sentence is spreading like good news among the Yi people in Xikang Province. But one old Yi man didn't believe it. This Yi compatriot had not gone down the mountain for more than twenty years because he was afraid of the Kuomintang's extortion and slaughter.
    One day, he braved the "danger" and went down the mountain to see what the People's Liberation Army was really like. He came to the regimental headquarters of our army and sat in a grand manner on the bed of Director Zhou Shufeng. When Director Zhou saw the distinguished guest, he personally served tea and cigarettes and offered cordial greetings. The old Yi man's tears rolled down uncontrollably, which surprised the host very much.
    After a while, the guest wiped away his tears and said, "The Kuomintang never treated us like human beings. They would scold and beat us if they were unhappy. I never thought that I could sit on your bed today and be treated like this."
  A Family
    When the Kuomintang ruled Ningshu, it was a world of bandits. The bandit troops robbed money and land, and slaughtered the Yi people. Therefore, the Yi people called officials "robbers and beasts." But after the People's Liberation Army arrived in Ningshu, everything changed.
    Deputy Political Instructor Pei Hongxi and several soldiers, once passing through the Yi area, were seen by the Yi people, Yue Gu, who immediately pulled them into his home and slaughtered a pig to treat them with the etiquette of welcoming distinguished guests. They declined, but Yue Gu got angry: "If you don't eat, then we are not of one heart!"
    When Pei Hongxi and others were about to leave, Yue Gu, according to Yi customs, gave them half a pig's head.
  Thousand-Gold Horse
    The troops captured a white horse in the battle in the farm. This horse could travel hundreds of miles a day and was called the Thousand-Gold Horse. It originally belonged to a Yi man, and the owner cherished it as much as his own eyes.
    When the Kuomintang bandit troops were here, a Regiment Commander Li took a fancy to it and forced the owner to give him the Thousand-Gold Horse every day. However, the owner of the Thousand-Gold Horse was willing to give three hundred taels of silver but was unwilling to give the horse. As a result, the insatiable bandit Regiment Commander not only got the silver but also the Thousand-Gold Horse. The old Yi man begged countless times, but the bandit Regiment Commander frightened him, saying that having the Thousand-Gold Horse was a "crime"! In the end, he did not get it back.
    When the People's Liberation Army learned that this horse belonged to the Yi people, they returned it to the owner without hesitation. This caused a sensation among the Yi people for hundreds of miles, and they passed it on as a magical story.
  Capturing Luo Tong Alive
    Luo Tong (real name Yuan Jinkui) was a special agent leader who had slaughtered countless people in Ningshu. The People's Liberation Army and the common people were catching him everywhere.
    One day, the Yi man Lao Wumuji captured Luo Tong alive. The local landlords, bullies, special agents, and bandits wanted to rescue Luo Tong by means of enticing and threatening, saying to the Yi people:
    "He is the 'leader of the Chinese Freedom and Equality Party,' he is the 'commander-in-chief of the Chinese Freedom and Equality Army.' After he is released, he will give you official positions and money."
    But the Yi people did not release Luo Tong, so those guys said:
    "After the People's Liberation Army is defeated, we will definitely kill you Yi people."
    The enlightened Lao Wumuji was never deceived by them and handed Luo Tong directly to the People's Liberation Army.
  Reciprocity
    When our army first arrived in Yuexi and Mianning, the living conditions were indeed difficult. They ate corn and swallowed wild vegetables, with no oil or salt. But every time they ate, the surrounding area was filled with Yi elders and children, who all stared with envious eyes because their lives were even harder.
    The commanders and fighters discussed: We should help the Yi compatriots. This proposal was immediately passed by everyone. After that, they took out a portion of their food every day to feed the elders and children.
    The Yi compatriots felt that the People's Liberation Army was too good, so they sent potatoes and firewood to the troops. The soldiers felt bad about it and sent them salt.
    The Yi people in some places, believing that the People's Liberation Army was a benevolent and righteous army, automatically sent pigs and cattle to the local garrison troops to express their love and concern for the troops. The soldiers sometimes politely declined, but sometimes returned cloth and salt of equal value (usually exceeding) to the Yi people.
    Whenever the Yi people came to visit the troops, they were warmly received. Some soldiers also gave the Yi people needles and thread. The Yi people felt that this gift was extremely valuable.

### 在彝民区里

　　在彝民区里
    慕兵
    编者按：西康省西昌专区辖九个县、四个设治局，即西昌、昭觉、宁南、德昌、会理、块边、块源、冕宁、越巂等九县，宁东、泸宁、黄草、普格四设治局。这一地区当地简称为宁属，南面临金沙江，北靠大渡河，境内杂居着各少数兄弟民族。解放前，宁属各少数民族长期遭受国民党及封建势力的残酷压迫。解放后由于党政军人员正确执行了民族政策，少数民族兄弟已改变了过去对汉族人民的仇视态度。这里发表的是我军与彝族同胞生活交往的片断记实，可以看出一种亲密的军民关系正在彝区成长着。          
  试探解放军
    “共产党的民族政策好，解放军的政治纪律好”，这句话像捷报一样在西康省彝民中传播着。但有一个老彝民却不相信。这位彝胞因为害怕国民党的敲诈和屠杀，已有二十多年没有下过山了。
    一天，他冒着“危险”下山来，看看解放军到底怎样。他来到我军某团团部，大模大样地坐在周树风主任的铺上。周主任一看贵宾到了，就亲自送茶递烟，亲切问候。老彝民的眼泪不由自主地滚下来，却弄得主人非常惊讶。
    一会，客人一面擦泪一面说：“国民党从来不把我们当人看待，不如意就骂就打，今天想不到能坐在你的铺上，还受你们这样待承。”
  一家人
    国民党统治宁属时，这里是强盗世界。匪军们抢钱掠地，屠杀彝民。因此，彝民称官人为“强盗和野兽”。但解放军到宁属后，一切都变了。
    连副指导员裴鸿喜和几个战士，一次路过彝区，被彝民岳古看到了，一下拉到家里，杀了一口猪，以招待贵宾的礼节来招待他们。他们谢绝，但岳古却生了气：“你们要不吃，那就不是一条心！”
    裴鸿喜等临走时，岳古按照彝族的风俗，送给他们半个猪头。
  千金马
    部队在农场战斗中，缴获了一匹小白马。这匹马一天能走几百里，名叫千金马。它原是一个彝民的，主人爱护它就像爱护自己的眼睛一样。
    国民党匪军在这里时，一个李团长看中了它，天天逼着要这匹千金马。可是，千金马的主人愿意给三百两银子，却不愿给马。结果是：贪得无厌的匪军团长，既得了银子又要了千金马。老彝民不知哀求了多少次，匪军团长吓唬他说：有千金马就有“罪”！终于没有要回去。
    解放军知道了这匹马是彝民的，就毫不犹疑地送还给主人。这一下轰动了数百里地的彝民，他们当做一个神奇的故事传述着。
  活捉罗通
    罗通（真名原金魁）是一个特务头子，在宁属不知屠杀了多少人民，解放军和老百姓到处捉拿他。
    一天，彝民老乌木基把罗通活捉了。当地的地主恶霸、特务土匪却想用利诱威胁的手段打救罗通，对彝民说：
    “他是‘中国自由平等党的领袖’，他是‘中国自由平等军的总司令’，放出他以后，要官有官，要钱有钱。”
    但彝民没有释放罗通，于是那些家伙们就说：
    “以后解放军被打垮了，非杀掉你们这些彝民不可。”
    提高了觉悟的老乌木基，始终没有受他们的欺骗，把罗通直接交给了解放军。
  礼尚往来
    我军刚到越隽、冕宁时，生活条件确实苦，吃玉茭，咽野菜，既无油，又无盐。但每逢开饭时，周围却站满了彝民的老人和小孩，他们都瞪大羡慕的眼睛，因为他们的生活更苦。
    指战员们就商议说：我们要救济救济彝胞才对。这个意见立即被全体通过了。之后他们每天都拿出一部分饭给老人和小孩吃。
    彝胞觉得解放军太好，就送洋芋和柴禾给部队；战士们过意不去，就送盐给他们。
    有些地方的彝民，认为解放军是仁义之师，为表示对部队的热爱和关怀，都自动送猪送牛给当地驻军。战士们有时婉言谢绝，有时却用同等代价（一般都是超过）的布匹和盐回送给彝民。
    当彝民每次来看望部队时，都受到热情的招待。有的战士还赠送彝民针线。彝民对这种礼物，极感宝贵。
