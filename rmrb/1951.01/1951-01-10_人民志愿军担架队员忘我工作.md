Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 9th: Our front-line reporter reported on the selfless work of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's front-line stretcher bearers overcoming difficulties, saying:

　　In the icy and snowy fields and under the hail of bullets on the Korean front, the heroic stretcher bearers use their creative labor to transport the wounded from the front lines to the rear day and night.

　　A certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army has a stretcher team with ten stretchers. In five days and five nights of fighting, they rescued eighty-three wounded soldiers, covering a total of more than 6,600 li. These wounded soldiers were able to reach the rear safely after being transported over many difficult routes. From the front line to the rear, two mountains had to be crossed. The mountain roads were steep and the ice and snow slippery, and even people walking empty-handed would stumble several times. However, the He Chaoming team, which promoted a high degree of class love for serving the wounded, created two methods for carrying stretchers over mountains. When climbing narrow, steep, and slippery mountain paths, they placed the front legs of the stretcher against the mountain path, and a comrade supported it from behind while bending over. The people in front dragged it up one step, and the people behind climbed up one step, dragging it up the mountain step by step. When descending the mountain, the back legs of the stretcher were placed on the ground, and the people in front held the stretcher handles, sitting on the ice and slowly sliding down. The people behind used ropes to tie the feet of the stretcher and slowly sent it down. Where the road was easier to walk, they divided into two groups of four people. When climbing the mountain, the taller people were in the back, and when descending the mountain, the taller people were in the front, ensuring not only that they would not fall, but also that the stretcher remained balanced at all times. Although carrying the stretcher in this way required much more sweat and several times more effort, it ensured that it was "carried steadily and transported quickly," reducing a lot of pain for the wounded.

　　人民志愿军担架队员忘我工作
    【新华社朝鲜前线九日电】本社前线记者报道我国人民志愿军前线担架队员克服困难，忘我工作的情形称：
    在朝鲜前线的冰天雪地与枪林弹雨中，英勇的担架队员以创造的劳动，日日夜夜从火线上把伤员运送到后方。
    中国人民志愿军某部有一支具有十付担架的担架队，在五天五夜的战斗中，抢救了八十三个伤员，共计走了六千六百多里路。这些伤员能够安全的到达后方，曾被运过了许多艰难的路程。从前线到后方，要翻越两座大山。山路陡峭，冰雪滑溜，连空手人行走，也会跌上几跤。但是，发扬了高度阶级友爱为伤员服务的何朝明小组，创造了两种抬担架翻山的方法。他们在爬越又窄又陡又滑的山道时，将担架的前脚贴着山道，后面由一个同志弯腰撑住，前面的人往上拖一步，后面的就往上爬一步，这样一步步的拖上山去。在下山时，把担架后腿贴地，前面的人握住担架把手，坐在冰道上徐徐往下滑。后面的人用绳子绑住担架的脚，慢慢往下送，在路比较好走的地方，他们就四个人分成两批，上山时高个子在后，下山时高个子在前，不但保证不跌跤，而且始终保持着担架的平衡。这样抬运担架虽然要多流许多汗，多出几倍力，但是却能保持“抬得稳，运得快。”减少了伤员很多痛苦。
