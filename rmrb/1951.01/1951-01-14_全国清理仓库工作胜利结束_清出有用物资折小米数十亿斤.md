Xinhua News Agency, January 11th: The national warehouse clearance work has been successfully completed and is now actively being planned for allocation. According to preliminary estimates, a large amount of industrial and mining equipment, gold, silver, foreign currency, grain, oil, paper, and other materials have been cleared out, with a total value equivalent to billions of jin of millet. Due to the complexity of valuation and registration, except for a small portion of industrial and mining equipment and other materials that have been used to offset the 1950 national investment or auctioned off as fiscal revenue, most of it will be used to offset the 1951 or 1952 national fiscal revenue. This is one of the great achievements of this warehouse clearance work.

This warehouse clearance work has cleared out a large amount of industrial and mining equipment necessary for economic construction. According to incomplete statistics, over 20,000 various machines (including various machine tools), over 2,400 mining machinery, over 5,800 electric motors, and over 7,900 vehicles have been cleared out. These materials were previously stockpiled and not fully utilized. They are now under the control of the Central People's Government and have begun to be uniformly scheduled and rationally allocated for full utilization.

Through this clearance work, the management of state assets has been initially improved, thus greatly reducing losses. For example, when the Southwest District Warehouse Material Clearance and Allocation Committee Branch inspected the work, it found many useful, even brand-new, equipment in the waste materials, which have now been taken out and properly preserved. The National Warehouse Material Clearance and Allocation Committee has notified the various branches of the inspection experience and problems found by the Southwest Branch to pay attention to and strengthen management.

During this national warehouse clearance work, all localities earnestly implemented the decision of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government on the national warehouse material clearance and allocation, and received the assistance of the broad masses of employees in carefully inventorying. This is the reason why this large-scale clearance work could be completed on schedule and achieve the above-mentioned great results.

In order to ensure that state assets are utilized in a timely manner, the National Warehouse Material Clearance and Allocation Committee has sent people to various places to organize allocation work. As of December 15th, the allocation work of the Qingdao warehouse has been completed, and its allocation of more than 48,000 cubic tons of materials can offset 100 million jin of millet in fiscal revenue, accounting for two-thirds of the local inventory. The Shanghai warehouse has now allocated most of the important materials. The allocated materials account for one-fifth of the total cubic tons of inventory, but the value accounts for four-fifths of the total value of the original materials.

Recently, during the unified allocation, individual areas have been found to have unauthorized use of materials even after the clearance. In order to implement the decision of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government on the unified national financial and economic work, these already used equipment and materials will be priced by the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government and deducted from the operating expenses budget of the respective departments.

　　全国清理仓库工作胜利结束
    清出有用物资折小米数十亿斤
    【新华社十一日讯】全国仓库清理工作已胜利完成，现正积极计划调配中。据初步估计，已清出的大量工矿器材、金银外币、粮食、油脂、纸张等物资，总值达数十亿斤小米之巨。由于估价与登记工作繁复，除一小部分工矿器材及其他物资已抵付一九五○年国家投资，或拍卖后抵作财政收入外，大部分将抵作一九五一年或一九五二年国家财政收入。这是此次清仓工作的巨大收获之一。
    这次清仓工作已清出大量的为经济建设所必需的工矿器材。据不完全统计，清出的各种机器达两万余部（包括各种工作母机）、矿山机械二千四百余部、电动机五千八百余部、汽车七千九百余辆。这些器材以往都被积压起来，未能充分利用，目前已由中央人民政府所掌握，并已开始加以统一调度，合理分配，以便充分利用。
    经过这次清理工作，国家资材的保管工作已初步改善，因而使损耗大大减少。例如西南区仓库物资清理调配委员会分会在检查工作时，发现在废料中有不少有用的甚至全新的器材，现在都已取出妥为保藏。全国仓库物资清理调配委员会已把西南分会检查经验及发现的问题通报各地分会注意并加强管理工作。
    此次全国清仓工作，各地均认真执行中央人民政府政务院关于全国仓库物资清理调配的决定，并获得广大职工的协助，认真清点。这是这次大规模清理工作能如期完成并获得上述巨大成绩的原因。
    为了能使国家资材及时得到利用，全国仓库物资清理调配委员会业已派人到各地去组织分配工作。截至十二月十五日止，青岛仓库的分配工作已结束，其分配物资四万八千余容积吨能抵财政收入一亿斤小米，占当地库存物资的三分之二。上海仓库目前已将重要物资大部分配。已分配的物资占库存物资总容积吨的五分之一，但价值可占原有物资总值的五分之四。
    最近在统一调配中，个别地区已发现在清理后仍然有擅自动用的情形。为贯彻中央人民政府政务院关于统一国家财政经济工作的决定，这些已经动用的器材物资都将由中央人民政府财政部作价后在该各部门事业费预算中扣除。
