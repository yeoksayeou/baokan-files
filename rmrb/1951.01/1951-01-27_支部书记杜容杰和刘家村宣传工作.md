　　Branch Secretary Du Rongjie and Propaganda Work in Liujia Village
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Zhi Ye

　　The CCP Liujia Village Branch in Xinmin County, Liaoxi Province, has done a very good job in propaganda during this Resist America, Aid Korea movement. Therefore, the masses in the whole village have launched a warm patriotic movement to volunteer for the army, participate in the war, and comfort the troops.

　　The good propaganda work in Liujia Village is inseparable from the exemplary and active leadership of the village branch secretary, Du Rongjie. Du Rongjie came from a working-class background and had two years of schooling. After liberation, she actively studied and is now a teacher at the village primary school. In her work, she always sets an example, plays a model role, and leads the masses to do many important things. For example, during flood prevention the year before last, Du Rongjie saw a breach in the river embankment when she returned home from school. Although her own home was located below the embankment and she had two children at home, the water would soon flow to her doorstep. But she thought: if the breach in the river embankment is not blocked immediately, the whole village will be flooded. As a Communist Party member, it is worthwhile to sacrifice her own home as long as the whole village is safe. Du Rongjie immediately returned to the village to call on Party and League members to take the lead and mobilize the masses to block the breach in the river embankment. Only then did she go home to rescue her children, and then returned to the embankment. Because of her selfless lead in rushing to rescue the embankment, she fell into the water twice and almost drowned. The masses were moved and said: "We should learn from Teacher Du!" Everyone actively rushed to block the breach, and finally quickly completed the entire project. Therefore, Du Rongjie has a very high prestige among the masses.

　　After Liujia Village established propagandists, Du Rongjie actively took on the task assigned to her by the Party to lead the propagandists.

　　In order to do a good job in propaganda, Du Rongjie first established a reporting system for propaganda work, stipulating that propagandists must report their activities and the ideological situation of the masses every seven days. Then, Du Rongjie led everyone to conduct research and analysis, and identify the more common and important issues in the work and among the masses as the content of the next propaganda and explanation. Once, when the branch was studying the ideological situation of the masses, it was found that some masses had paralyzing ideas such as "Our strength is great, the United States cannot defeat us" and "The United States is fighting in Korea, what does it have to do with us?". The branch arranged propaganda work targeting this kind of thinking, requiring propagandists to focus on publicizing the friendly relationship between the Chinese and Korean people, the aggressive ambitions of American imperialism, and explaining that aiding Korea is precisely for defending our homes and defending our country. Later, it was discovered that the masses did not have much hatred for American imperialism, so the branch arranged to publicize the truth about American imperialism's support for Japan, the atrocities of American imperialism killing Korean people in Korea, and inspired everyone to recall the past oppression by Japanese devils. This increased the masses' hatred of American imperialism.

　　In order to help everyone complete the propaganda task well, the branch established a regular inspection system. Du Rongjie and other comrades, in addition to carrying out propaganda themselves after each work deployment, also checked the work of each propagandist. If it was found that a propagandist's propaganda was insufficient, they immediately tried to supplement the propaganda and explanation; trying to ensure that each propaganda could have its due effect. Once, poor peasant Di Chengcai was impatient when he saw students performing the Yangko dance, saying: "You are still happy? Don't you see what time it is now!" This shows that his understanding of the current situation was not clear enough, and he was somewhat pessimistic. The propagandist told him about the situation, but he didn't believe it. When Du Rongjie found out, she personally went to him to conduct propaganda and explanation. Du Rongjie started from Di Chengcai's childhood herding pigs, growing up and working hard, all the way to after liberation, when Di Chengcai was given a house and land, and now lives a good life without worrying about food and fuel; then she talked about the purpose of American imperialism's aggression against Korea, and that we have the strength to defeat American imperialism's attack. After Du Rongjie's repeated and patient persuasion, Di Chengcai understood, and he said: "I must fight the American devils to the end and resolutely follow the Communist Party!"

　　In the inspection, Du Rongjie also paid great attention to commendation and criticism work, commending the propagandists who performed well and criticizing those who did not perform well. Moreover, the leaders also regularly conducted self-criticism to improve their leadership work.

　　The Liujia Village Branch paid great attention to the education and training of propagandists. When Liujia Village first established propagandists, most of the propagandists did not know how to conduct propaganda. When some people were propagandizing to the masses, they read out some resolutions or instructions from higher authorities like reciting a book. The branch's solution to this difficulty, in addition to providing individual help to the propagandists, was to organize propagandists' speech meetings. Through this kind of speech meeting, the propaganda ability of the propagandists was rapidly improved. Even in this tense Resist America, Aid Korea movement, the branch did not relax its training work for propagandists. And adopted methods such as taking apprentices, with skilled propagandists leading unskilled propagandists. On the other hand, the branch also paid attention to seeking out and cultivating propagandist talents among the masses. After the branch discovered talents that could be cultivated, it first provided them with some propaganda materials, taught them some propaganda methods, and encouraged them to propagate to the masses. When he was fully qualified as a propagandist, he was formally absorbed as a propagandist. This ensures that the propagandists developed can meet the standards required by the Party.

　　In propaganda activities, on the one hand, it is necessary to maintain close contact with the masses, and on the other hand, it is necessary to rely on the higher authorities. Du Rongjie understands this principle very well. In addition to maintaining close contact with the masses, she can also constantly ask the higher authorities for instructions on propaganda principles and methods, or ask the higher authorities to help answer difficult questions encountered in propaganda. For example, when the Resist America, Aid Korea movement began, some masses did not understand the changes in the situation and were afraid. Some buried grain, and some ate and drank heavily. Although Du Rongjie did not know the propaganda policy of the higher authorities, she had a foundation in her thinking, so she said to the masses: "Don't panic. Three or four years ago, when we were fighting guerrilla warfare, if there was an enemy situation, the People's Government would tell everyone to quickly harvest, pull, and hide the crops a few days in advance. Now, if there is any movement, the People's Government would have told us long ago. Now our country is so powerful, there will never be a change. Don't panic!" This stabilized the emotions of the masses. Yan Guiqing said: "It's right to listen to Teacher Du!" Du Rongjie immediately contacted the district and the district committee, clarified the current situation and propaganda policy, and arranged for propagandists to carry out current affairs propaganda on resisting America and aiding Korea and protecting the home and the country, and correctly resolved various ideological problems for the masses. This would of course be warmly welcomed by the masses. Du Rongjie would be surrounded by the masses every time she returned from the district, asking her to answer their questions and tell them current affairs news.

　　支部书记杜容杰和刘家村宣传工作
    之也
    辽西新民县的中共刘家村支部，在这次抗美援朝运动中，宣传工作作得很好；因此全村群众掀起了热烈的志愿参军、参战和劳军的爱国主义运动。
    刘家村的宣传工作作的好，是与村支部书记杜容杰以身作则、积极领导分不开的。杜容杰女工出身，念过二年书；解放后积极学习，现在担任本村小学教员。她在工作中，处处能以身作则，起模范作用，领导群众办了很多大事。例如前年夏防中，杜容杰放学回家时，看见河堤开了口子，虽然她自己家就住在堤下边，家里还有两个孩子，水会很快流到家门口；但是她想：如果不马上堵住河堤的口子，全村都会被水淹了，自己是个共产党员，只要全村安全，即使牺牲了自己的家也是值得的。杜容杰马上回到村里号召党、团员带头，动员了群众把河堤的口子堵住。这时她才回家把孩子救出来，接着又回到堤上。由于她不顾一切的带头抢险，曾两次掉在水里，险些没被淹死。群众被感动的说：“我们应该向杜老师学习呀！”大家积极抢堵，终于很快的完成了堵口的全部工程。因此，杜容杰在群众中的威信是很高的。
    刘家村建立宣传员后，杜容杰就积极地担负起党交给她的领导宣传员的任务。
    杜容杰为了要把宣传员工作作好，首先建立了宣传工作上的汇报制度，规定宣传员每七天必须汇报一次自己活动情况和群众思想情况。然后杜容杰领导大家进行研究分析，找出工作中与群众中的比较普遍的重要的问题，作为下一次的宣传解释的内容。有一次，支部在研究群众思想情况时，发现有一部分群众有“咱们力量大，美国打不过来”、“美国在朝鲜打仗，和咱们有啥关系”等麻痹思想。支部就针对这种思想布置了宣传工作，要宣传员着重宣传中朝人民的友谊关系，美帝国主义的侵略野心，说明援朝正是为了保家卫国。以后又发现了群众对美帝国主义的仇恨不大，支部就布置宣传美帝国主义扶日真象、美帝国主义在朝鲜杀害朝鲜人民的暴行，并启发大家回忆过去受日本鬼子压迫的情形。这就使群众增加了对美帝国主义的仇恨。
    支部为了帮助大家很好地完成宣传任务，建立了经常的检查制度。杜容杰和其他同志每在工作布置后，除了自己进行宣传外，同时检查各宣传员工作情况。如果发现有个宣传员宣传得不够时，他们即设法予以补充宣传解释；尽可能使每个宣传都能得到应有的作用。有一次贫农邸成才见到学生扭秧歌时，就不耐烦地说：“你们还乐呢？也不看看现在到什么时候啦！”这说明他对时局的认识不太清楚，有些悲观。宣传员就向他讲形势，但他不相信。杜容杰知道了就亲自去对他进行宣传解释。杜容杰从邸成才小时候放猪，长大扛活受苦讲起，一直讲到解放以后，邸成才分了房子分了地，现在过着不愁吃不愁烧的好日子；随后又讲到美帝国主义侵略朝鲜的目的，和我们有力量来击溃美帝国主义的进攻。经过杜容杰反复的耐心的说服，邸成才才明白了，他表示：“我一定要和美国鬼子干到底，坚决跟着共产党走！”
    在检查中，杜容杰又很注意表扬与批评工作，对表现好的宣传员进行表扬，表现不好的即给以批评。而且领导上也经常进行自我批评，改进自己的领导工作。
    刘家村支部很注意教育与培养宣传员的工作。刘家村开始建立宣传员时，大部分宣传员是不会进行宣传的，有些人给群众宣传时，像背书一样的念一些上级的决议或指示。支部解决这一困难的办法，除了对宣传员进行个别帮助外，就是组织宣传员讲演会。通过这种讲演会迅速的提高了宣传员的宣传能力。就是在这次紧张的抗美援朝运动中，支部也没有放松对宣传员的培养工作。并采用带徒弟等办法，熟练的宣传员带领不熟练的宣传员。另一方面，支部又注意在群众中物色与培养宣传员人材。支部在发现可以培养的人材后，即先供给他一些宣传资料，教他一些宣传方法鼓励他去向群众宣传。等他完全具备了宣传员条件时，即正式吸收为宣传员。这样保证了所发展的宣传员能够达到党所要求的标准。
    在宣传活动中，一方面要密切联系群众，另一方面要依靠上级。杜容杰是很懂得这个道理的。她除了与群众取得密切联系外，还能不断地向上级请示宣传方针、方法，或请求上级帮助解答宣传中遇到的疑难问题。例如抗美援朝运动开始时，有些群众不了解形势的变化，发生了恐惧，有的埋粮食，有的大吃大喝。杜容杰虽然不知道上级的宣传方针，但她思想上有底子，她就对群众说：“不要慌，三、四年前打游击时，有了敌情人民政府头多少天就告诉大家把庄稼快打、快拉、快藏现在若是有动静的话，人民政府早告诉咱们了。现在咱们国家力量这么足，决变不了天，大家不要恐慌！”这样稳定了群众的情绪，鄢桂清说：“听杜老师的话，没错！”杜容杰马上又到区里和区委取了联系，明了了当前形势与宣传方针，就布置宣传员进行了抗美援朝保家卫国的时事宣传，给群众正确地解决了各种思想问题。这样当然会受到群众热烈的欢迎，杜容杰每次从区上回来时，就会被群众包围起来，要求她解答自己的疑问和讲时事消息。
