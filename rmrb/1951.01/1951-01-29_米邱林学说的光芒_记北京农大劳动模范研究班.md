　　The Radiance of Michurin's Theory
    ——A Record of the Labor Model Study Class at Beijing Agricultural University
    Huang Dongsen
  (1) Farmers Enter University for the First Time
    Beijing Agricultural University held a Labor Model Study Class in the last semester of last year. After six months of study, it graduated on January 17th this year.
    The students came from the areas around Changzhi, Shanxi Province, which produces millet and corn, and from the North China Plain, which produces cotton. They are all leaders in organizing the masses to promote production, or experts in cotton production.
    Some of them are young fellows, and some are old heroes in their fifties. They never dreamed before that they could live a happy study life in the people's university today.
  (2) Elevating Experience to Theory
    Although the labor models had very skilled and ingenious farming techniques, they had no opportunity for education and no freedom and right to enter university in old China. Therefore, they lacked systematic scientific knowledge and could not elevate experience to theory.
    During this period of study, they were divided into research groups for cotton, millet, sweet potato, corn, etc. according to their specialties, and held discussions. At the meeting, the labor models exchanged cultivation experience and discussed difficult problems related to crops. The comrades of the workstation recorded everyone's speech in detail, and then systematically sorted it out as supplementary content and research materials for the teaching materials.
    The labor models reported their experience: applying base fertilizer and proper watering can promote the development of the root system; earthing up corn can develop aerial roots; planting two corn plants together can allow the roots to cross each other and help each other, which has a wind-proof effect. Planting two rows of corn in the middle, and planting kidney beans on both sides, with the kidney beans entwining on the corn; one row of corn and one row of kidney beans, forming a combat team... can prevent the lodging of corn. Wang Gengyin, a labor model from Lucheng, Shanxi, reported his experience of planting wheat twice a year. The teachers then gave a theoretical analysis of these experiences.
    In just half a year, they studied agronomy, forestry, horticulture, soil, plant pathology, entomology, agricultural chemistry, animal husbandry, and veterinary medicine, and solved many difficult problems. They saw the spores of wheat rust, corn smut, and millet head smut under the microscope; they saw various forms of insects in the specimen room. They learned the preparation methods of various commonly used insecticides in the laboratory. They learned a lot of knowledge about production. For example, they used to think that "half a harvest for jaundice, no harvest for black jaundice" was a good year, but now they know that this is the result of the climate being suitable for the reproduction of germs; they only knew that crop rotation would increase yields, but now they further know that various crops can thrive only under certain living conditions.
    Wang Luoduan, a afforestation hero, used to only know that moisture in sandy soil is easily lost; intercropping with corn grows well; and crops require large amounts of manure and water, but he didn't know why. Now, he understands: sand particles are large and moisture is easily lost; there are rhizobium bacteria on the roots of beans, which can fix nitrogen and supply corn; and manure contains various nutrients needed by crops.
  (3) Finding the Key
    In the past six months, the labor models have learned the most advanced science - Michurin agricultural science. Michurin science is a popularized science that can be accepted and mastered by the broad masses of peasants. It inspired their creativity. Wang Gengyin, a labor model from Lucheng, Shanxi, said: I will change the original experimental field to operate with new methods; Han Qiming plans to try planting vernalized wheat from Michurin's theory, because in his hometown - Gaoping County, Shanxi Province, it is often impossible to plant winter wheat in autumn due to dry soil. If it is sown in spring after vernalization, the wheat can get the nourishment of snow water and thrive.
    The labor models finally took this "key" - Michurin's theory - home. They have the confidence and determination to rely on it to solve difficult problems in production.
    Soviet agronomist and Dean of the Soviet Timiryazev Agricultural Academy, Comrade Stoletov, said after visiting China: "Chinese farmers are the smartest." Yes, Chinese farmers have unlimited wisdom, and they have accumulated a lot of valuable experience from their labor for thousands of years. Once their experience is combined with Michurin's theory, it will emit infinite brilliance in China's agricultural production.
    Are there any concrete examples to illustrate this point? Yes: Xu Moshan, a labor model from Shijiazhuang Prefecture, created a new record of 600 jin of cotton per mu in 1950; Li Fucheng, a labor model, achieved a yield of four shi of millet per mu; Wang Gengyin exceptionally harvested wheat twice from a field in one year (the first time he harvested spring wheat, and then planted spring wheat for the second time at the summer solstice), and the second harvest exceeded the first. Wang Yanyan, a labor hero from Shanxi, achieved a yield of 1,300 jin of corn per mu (the specific situation is being understood).
  (4) Thank Chairman Mao
    At the graduation ceremony, the labor models felt infinite honor and pride. They received their graduation certificates in bursts of applause. They excitedly wrote a letter to Chairman Mao, fully expressing their respect for the leader of the Chinese people. In their letter they said: "We will tell the vast number of folks the theories and techniques we have learned and fight to increase agricultural production!"

　　米邱林学说的光芒
    ——记北京农大劳动模范研究班
    黄东森
  （一）农民第一次进了大学
    北京农业大学于去年下学期举办了劳模研究班，经过六个月的学习，已于今年一月十七日毕业了。
    学员们有来自山西长治一带出产谷子和玉米地区的劳动英雄，有来自华北平原产棉地区的劳动模范。他们都是组织群众推动生产的带头人，或是产棉的能手。
    他们中有的是年青的小伙子，有的是五十多岁的老英雄。他们以前连做梦也没想到，今天能够在人民的大学里，过着愉快的学习生活。
  （二）把经验提升为理论
    劳动模范们虽然有着十分熟练与精巧的耕作技术，但在旧中国，他们没有受教育的机会，没有进大学的自由与权利，因此他们缺乏系统的科学知识，无法把经验提升为理论。
    在此次学习期间，他们按照各人的特长分成棉花、谷子、甘薯（白薯）、玉米等研究小组，举行座谈。会上，劳动模范们交流了栽培经验，讨论了有关作物的疑难问题。工作站的同志们则把每个人的发言详细地记录下来，然后有系统的加以整理，作为教材的补充内容和研究资料。
    劳动模范们报告了自己的经验：上基肥和适当的浇水，可以促成根系发展；玉米培土，可以发达地上根；二棵玉米种在一起，根部可互相交叉起来，彼此互相帮助，有防风的作用。二行玉米种在中间，两旁种菜豆，菜豆缠绕到玉米上；一行玉米一行菜豆，组成一个战斗小组，……都可以防止玉米的倒伏。山西潞城劳动模范王庚寅报告了一年种两次小麦的经验。教员们则对这些经验，加以理论的分析。
    在短短的半年中，他们学习了农艺、森林、园艺、土壤、植物病理、昆虫、农业化学、畜牧、兽医，解决了许多的难题。他们从显微镜下看到了小麦黄疸病（锈病）、玉米黑穗病、小米白发病的病菌胞子；他们从标本室看到了昆虫的各种形态。他们从实验室学习了各种常用杀虫药剂的制法。他们知道了许多关于生产方面的知识，譬如，从前他们以为：“黄疸收一半，黑疸不见面”是大年，现在他们知道了这是气候适合病菌繁殖的结果；从前他们只知道庄稼要换茬（轮栽）产量才高，现在他们进一步知道了各种庄稼在一定的生活条件下才能滋生繁茂。
    造林英雄王洛端，从前只知道沙土水分容易流失；玉米间作长得好；庄稼要求粪大水勤，但不知道为什么。现在，他懂得：沙粒大水分易流失；豆子根上有根瘤菌，可以固氮供给玉米用；粪中有庄稼所需要的各种养分。
  （三）找到了钥匙
    半年来，劳动模范们学到了最进步的科学——米邱林农业科学。米邱林科学是一门大众化的科学，它能为广大的农民群众所接受、掌握。它启发了他们的创造性。山西潞城劳动模范王庚寅说：我要把原来的实验地改用新的方法去操作；韩启明计划试种米邱林学说中的春化小麦，因为在他的故乡——山西高平县，往往由于土壤干旱而无法在秋天里种上冬麦，如果经过春化后在春天播种，小麦可获得雪水的滋润而茁生。
    劳动模范们终于带着这把“钥匙”——米邱林学说回家了。他们有信心，而且决心要依靠它来解决生产中的困难问题。
    苏联农学家、苏联季米里亚席夫农学院院长史托列托夫同志在访问中国后发表观感说：“中国农民是最聪明的。”是的，中国农民具有无限的智慧，他们几千年来从劳作中积累了许多宝贵的经验。一旦他们的经验和米邱林学说结合起来，就将在中国的农业生产中放出无限的光辉。
    有什么具体的例证足以说明这一点吗？有的：石家庄专区劳动模范许墨山一九五○年创造了每亩产棉六百斤的新纪录；劳动模范李福成一亩谷子的产量竟达到四石；王庚寅破例地一年从一块田地上收了二次小麦（第一次收了春小麦，接着在夏至时种第二次春麦），而第二次的收获量超过了第一次。山西劳动英雄王彦颜每亩玉米的产量竟达到一千三百斤（具体情形正在了解中）。
  （四）感谢毛主席
    在毕业典礼上，劳动模范们感到无比的荣誉与骄傲。他们在阵阵掌声中领取了毕业证书。他们激动地给毛主席写了信，充分地表示了对于中国人民领袖的崇敬。他们在信中说：“我们要把学到的理论和技术告诉广大的老乡们，为增加农业生产而斗争！”
