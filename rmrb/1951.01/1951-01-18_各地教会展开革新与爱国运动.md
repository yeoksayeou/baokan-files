Churches Across the Country Launch Renewal and Patriotic Movements
　　Catholic Figures in Zhangjiakou Issue Declaration

　　Catholic figures in Zhangjiakou City held an anti-American, aid-Korea, protect-the-homeland demonstration rally on the 14th and issued a declaration, stating:

　　As the flames of the American imperialist war of aggression against Korea have spread to our country's borders, our entire nation has launched an anti-American, aid-Korea, protect-the-homeland movement to defend our motherland and stop the aggression. We, all Catholic believers, also express extreme hatred and indignation towards this shameless and barbaric behavior of American imperialism. For the survival of the Korean people and to safeguard the security of our motherland, we have risen up, expressing our determination to resist America and aid Korea, extensively launching signature campaigns and holding demonstrations, and agreeing on a patriotic covenant. From now on, we must intensify our study, raise our vigilance, and eliminate the erroneous ideas of worshipping, fearing, and fawning upon America. We are also determined to take practical actions to prevent the activities of bandits and secret agents, strive to improve production, support the anti-American front, and fight to defend world peace and smash the aggression of American imperialism. We hope that Catholic believers in all regions will actively respond to this movement, stand on the same battle line as the people of the whole country, and work together to defend world peace and build a new China, so that the doctrines of our Catholic Church – love for the motherland, love for the people, and love for peace – will be even more clearly demonstrated to the world.

　　Catholic Believers in Anyue, Northern Sichuan, Issue Letter to Fellow Believers

　　Fan Maoshi, a Catholic priest in Anyue County, Northern Sichuan District, led 265 believers to sign and issue a letter to all fellow believers on December 25th of last year, responding to the renewal movement and the religious reform movement.

　　The letter to fellow believers pointed out: After Catholicism was formally introduced into China in the late Ming and early Qing dynasties, imperialists, in order to achieve their ambition of invading our country's territory and enslaving our people, often used "protecting the church" as a pretext to intensify their aggression.

　　The letter to fellow believers pointed out: Now that the people of our country have been liberated from long-term dark rule and have become the masters of a free, independent, and democratic new China, and under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, are actively engaged in construction work, the imperialists, headed by American imperialism, are wantonly obstructing and undermining this, launching and expanding their war of aggression. We are inspired by the righteousness of loving the motherland and loving the people, and enthusiastically respond to the "self-reliance and renewal" movement, resolutely expressing that in all kinds of difficulties, we must overcome all obstacles and have no relations with imperialism in order to thoroughly realize the concrete policy of "self-governance, self-support, and self-propagation."

　　The letter to fellow believers put forward the following three points as a path for future joint efforts with all patriotic Catholics:

　　First, we must resolutely trust the government and support the provisions of the Common Program regarding "freedom of religious belief," and implement religious doctrines within the scope of government laws and regulations. Because Chairman Mao said as early as "On Coalition Government": "As long as believers abide by government laws, the government will protect them. Believers and non-believers each have their freedom and must not be coerced or discriminated against." So we must never doubt this, lest we mislead ourselves.

　　Second, we must obey all government laws and policies with a loyal, frank, and sincere attitude, and actively serve the people together with the people of the whole country; and we must raise our vigilance so that we are not used by secret agent saboteurs to carry out counter-revolutionary and anti-people activities under the guise of religion. We will certainly cleanse out any believers who are disloyal to the country and violate the interests of the people.

　　Third, we should strive to study and transform ourselves, participate in labor, and improve production; assist the government in eliminating bandits and secret agents, overcoming all our own difficulties, assisting in completing the great tasks of rent reduction, deposit refunds, and opposition to local bullies in rural areas, consolidating the revolutionary order; and vigorously support the Chinese People's Volunteers who are going to Korea to thoroughly crush the aggression of American imperialism and protect our homeland.

　　The letter to fellow believers concluded: Fellow believers: We must now unite with the people of the whole country and not allow any imperialists to invade our sacred territory or defile our church. With our high religious spirit, under the leadership of the government, we will resolutely crush the aggressive ambitions of the American imperialist bloc, safeguard the glorious and great victory of the revolution, and strive for lasting world peace!

　　Catholic Believers in Luzhou and Other Places Gather to Respond to Renewal

　　Catholic believers in Luzhou City, Southern Sichuan District, and Daxian and Jiangyou counties, Northern Sichuan District, have successively held gatherings, issued declarations, and formulated patriotic covenants, enthusiastically launching the renewal movement. Catholic believers in Luzhou City held a renewal movement meeting on the 15th, passing a renewal declaration initiated by Father Zhou Zhaoxian, believer Tian Wanshan, and 26 others. All 302 believers present signed the declaration. The declaration called on Catholics to smash the imperialist plot to use the cloak of the church to conceal their aggression and to fight to defend world peace and consolidate the victory of new China!

　　Four hundred and fifty Catholic believers in Daxian County gathered on December 25th of last year to discuss renewal issues, and issued a declaration responding to the renewal movement and formulated ten patriotic covenants as a direction for future efforts by every Catholic believer. The ten patriotic covenants are: 1. We must achieve self-governance, self-support, and self-propagation. 2. We must thoroughly eliminate our three major enemies: imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. 3. We will never allow imperialist elements to stand in our church. 4. We must always pay attention to the intrusion of reactionary elements into our church to carry out activities that undermine the people and the motherland. 5. If we discover counter-revolutionary elements, we will immediately hand them over to the government for legal action. 6. We must stand at our religious posts and do our own work well. 7. We must rely on our own efforts to achieve our self-support. 8. In order to implement self-governance and self-propagation, we have decided to sever all ties with imperialists. 9. Under the leadership and protection of the People's Government, we are willing to contribute all our strength to serve the motherland and the people. 10. We wholeheartedly support and participate in the movements of rent reduction, bandit suppression, anti-local bully, and resisting America and aiding Korea to protect our homeland.

　　Tang Shiwen, Li Jiancen, and 72 other Catholic believers in Zhongba District, Jiangyou County, also held a current affairs discussion meeting on December 25th of last year, and conducted an in-depth discussion on the aggressive nature of imperialism and its purpose in preaching in China. At the meeting, everyone unanimously passed the renewal movement declaration.

　　Two hundred and eighteen Catholic and Christian believers in Langzhong County jointly held a renewal movement symposium at the end of December last year. Everyone unanimously condemned the crimes of American imperialism in using the church to carry out aggressive activities in China. Father Tang Dongchu of the Catholic Church firmly stated at the symposium: He would sever all ties with imperialism and implement self-governance, self-support, and self-propagation.

　　Hangzhou Catholic Church Establishes Preparatory Committee for Renewal Movement

　　The Archdiocese of Hangzhou, China, convened a preparatory meeting for the renewal movement on the 14th. One hundred and twenty representatives from various Catholic churches and convent congregations under the jurisdiction of the Hangzhou district attended. The meeting unanimously approved the establishment of the "Renewal Movement Committee of the Archdiocese of Hangzhou, China." The meeting elected Father Wang Keqian, believer Hu Haiqiu, and nine others as members of the committee. At the meeting, Father Wang Keqian elaborated on the significance of the Three-Self Renewal Movement of self-governance, self-support, and self-propagation, and expressed his firm support for the decision of the State Council of the Central People's Government to sever ties with imperialism and run all church affairs with the strength of the Chinese people themselves. In his speech, believer Hu Haiqiu hoped that fellow believers would strengthen their national self-esteem, recognize the strength of the Chinese people, promote the spirit of patriotism, actively promote the renewal movement of the church, so that the church could break away from the shackles of imperialism and implement self-governance, self-support, and self-propagation.

　　Christians in Guangxi Respond to Renewal Movement

　　Christians in Nanning, Guilin, Liuzhou and other places in Guangxi enthusiastically respond to the Christian Renewal Movement. More than 1,300 people have signed the Renewal Declaration. Christians in Nanning City also held a meeting on the 8th of this month to solemnly announce the implementation of self-governance, self-support and self-propagation. The Sheng Kung Hui (Anglican Church) in the city called on the church staff to learn production technology. The association has purchased seven sewing machines and two looms for staff to engage in production.

　　Northeast China Christian Renewal Promotion Committee Established

　　In order to respond to the national Christian Renewal Movement, Christian organizations in Northeast China have established the Northeast China Christian Renewal Promotion Committee. This institution was established by the Northeast China Conference of the Church of Christ in China at a board meeting held from the 5th to the 9th of this month. The board meeting focused on discussing and studying how to specifically implement the renewal policy of self-governance, self-support and self-propagation. The meeting also elected Wang Chen, Director of the Northeast China Conference of the Church of Christ in China, Gong Tianmin, Deputy Director of the Shenyang YMCA, and nine others as standing committee members, and Gao Yucong, pastor of the Changchun Christian Church, and ten others as local promotion committee members, responsible for promoting and assisting the renewal work of churches in various parts of Northeast China. The meeting determined that the committee's urgent task is to collect and introduce government decrees, renewal documents, and current affairs information related to the church, and to lead church workers and believers at all levels to study, in order to eliminate the influence of imperialism from their ideological understanding and enhance patriotic thought. In order to realize the policy of church self-sufficiency, the board meeting also decided to establish a production enterprise committee.

　　各地教会展开革新与爱国运动
    张家口天主教人士发表宣言
    张家口市天主教人士于十四日举行的抗美援朝保家卫国示威游行大会发表宣言，内称：
    当美帝国主义侵朝战争火焰已燃烧到我国边境时，我全国人民为了保卫祖国和制止侵略，展开了抗美援朝保家卫国运动。我全体天主教友，对美帝国主义这种无耻野蛮的行为，亦表示极端痛恨和愤慨，我们为了朝鲜人民的生存，为了保卫祖国的安全，业已奋起，表示抗美援朝的决心，广泛展开了签名运动，并举行示威游行，议订爱国公约。今后我们要加紧学习，提高警觉，肃清崇美、恐美、媚美的错误思想。我们并决以实际行动，防止奸匪特务活动，努力搞好生产，支援抗美前线，为保卫世界和平和粉碎美帝国主义的侵略而奋斗。希我各地教友都要积极响应这一运动，和全国人民站在一条战线上，共同为保卫世界和平，为建设新中国而努力，使我天主教爱祖国、爱人民、爱和平的教义，益见昭明于世界。
    川北安岳天主教徒发表告教友书
    川北区安岳县天主教神父范茂实率领教徒二百六十五人于去年十二月二十五日签名发表响应革新运动告全体教友书，响应宗教革新运动。
    告教友书指出：天主教在明末清初时代正式传入中国以后，帝国主义者为了达到他们侵略我国领土、奴役我国人民的野心，就常借“护教”为名，变本加厉实行侵略。
    告教友书指出：现在我国人民从长期黑暗统治之下被解放而成了自由、独立、民主新中国的主人翁，在毛主席及中央人民政府领导下，正积极从事建设工作，而以美帝国主义为首的各帝国主义者横加阻挠破坏，发动并扩大其侵略战争。我们为爱祖国、爱人民的正义所感召，热烈响应“自立革新”运动，坚决表示在各种艰困中均须克服一切困难，不与帝国主义发生任何关系，以彻底实现“自治、自养、自传”的具体方针。
    告教友书提出以下三项，作为与全体爱国的天主教徒今后共同努力的途径：
    第一、我们要坚决信赖政府和拥护共同纲领“宗教信仰自由”的规定，在政府法令范围内，执行宗教教义。因为毛主席早在《论联合政府》中就曾经说过：“只要教徒们遵守政府法律，政府就给以保护。信教的和不信教的各有他们的自由，不许加以强迫或歧视。”所以我们绝不要怀疑，以免自误。
    第二、我们要以忠诚坦白和诚恳的态度，服从政府一切法令政策，和全国人民一道，积极地为人民服务；并提高警惕，勿为特务破坏分子利用宗教进行反革命、反人民的活动。凡有不忠于国家及违背人民利益的教徒，我们必将他们清洗出去。
    第三、我们应该努力学习和改造自己，参加劳动，搞好生产；协助政府肃清土匪特务，克服一切本身困难，协助完成农村减租、退押、反恶霸的伟大任务，巩固革命秩序；并大力支援赴朝的中国人民志愿军，彻底粉碎美帝国主义的侵略，实行保家卫国。
    告教友书最后说：教友们：我们现在要和全国人民团结起来，不许任何帝国主义侵略我国神圣的领土，玷辱我们教会，用我们高度的宗教真精神，在政府的领导下，坚决粉碎美帝国主义集团的侵略野心，维护光辉的革命伟大胜利，争取世界持久和平！

    江油县中坝区天主教徒唐世文、李建岑等七十四人亦于去年十二月二十五日举行了时事座谈会，对帝国主义的侵略本质及其在中国传教的目的作了深入的讨论。会上，大家一致通过了革新运动宣言。
