　　Northwest Improves Livestock Breeds and Strengthens Disease Prevention

　　Thanks to the adoption of policies to protect livestock, attention to improving livestock breeds, and vigorous efforts in livestock immunization by the People's Governments at all levels in Northwest China, livestock mortality rates were greatly reduced last year, and livestock production increased slightly in some areas.

　　The Northwest region is one of the most famous pastoral areas in the country, with livestock income accounting for 30% to 40% of the total agricultural income in the Northwest. However, in the past, under the plunder and oppression of the Kuomintang reactionaries, not only was the grassland damaged and the pastoral areas gradually reduced, but also due to the prevalence of animal diseases, the mortality rate of livestock was extremely high, and livestock production decreased year by year, seriously affecting the economic life of the various ethnic herders.

　　After the liberation of the Northwest, the People's Governments at all levels in the Northwest paid attention to the development of animal husbandry, resolutely implemented the policy of protecting and developing animal husbandry in the pastoral areas, strictly prohibited the slaughter of draught animals and young animals, and selectively issued livestock loans. Last year, the Animal Husbandry Department of the Northwest Military and Political Committee allocated 1.05 million jin of millet as livestock loans, and the People's Governments at all levels carried out the work of improving livestock breeds. The Wugong Livestock Breeding Farm in Shaanxi Province newly established three breeding stations last year (together with the original eight, now there are eleven), implementing artificial insemination breeding. From February to October last year, a total of 3,750 initial inseminations and 4,472 re-inseminations were performed. In May and June, the livestock breeding promotion agencies in Qinghai Province also inseminated livestock for herders 633 times. Thanks to the above measures taken by the People's Government, the livestock production in the whole region is gradually increasing. In Xinjiang Province alone, livestock production last year increased by 20% compared with 1949.

　　At the same time as improving livestock breeds, the People's Governments at all levels in Northwest China have also vigorously carried out animal disease prevention and control work. The People's Government has successively established 58 animal disease prevention and control stations, offices, and institutes in various livestock producing areas, and also established 11 animal disease prevention and control teams, organizing more than 600 veterinary cadres to work in the animal disease areas. They have successively eradicated various animal diseases such as rinderpest, anthrax, sheep pox, and swine fever, which were prevalent in more than 20 counties in Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Xinjiang and other provinces. According to incomplete statistics, in the nine months from March to November last year, a total of more than 650,000 head of livestock were vaccinated and cured. (Xinhua News Agency)

　　Xinhua News Agency: North China Bred More Than 510,000 Head of Livestock This Year

　　North China has achieved remarkable results in breeding livestock and preventing animal diseases this year. According to incomplete statistics, more than 512,900 head of livestock were bred in North China last year. In Hebei, Shanxi, and Pingyuan provinces in the region, a total of more than 1.23 million head of livestock were vaccinated or cured.

　　In order to restore and develop agricultural production, the People's Governments at all levels in North China vigorously supported farmers in increasing the number of draught animals last year. The Shanxi Provincial People's Government issued more than 1.2 million jin of grain for livestock loans and set up 400 breeding stations. When carrying out breeding work, the People's Governments of 40 counties, including Qinyang and Lingchuan, also held symposiums for livestock breeding households or organized breeding training classes to exchange and improve breeding experience and technology, thereby increasing the survival rate of young animals. In the spring and autumn of 1949 last year, the Pingyuan Provincial People's Government also allocated 7.52 million jin of draught animal loan grain to help farmers purchase and breed draught animals, so that the number of draught animals in the province increased by about 240,000 head compared with 1949. In the waterlogged areas of the province, where there were fewer draught animals, each draught animal had to cultivate an average of 60 mu of land in 1949, but last year, due to the gradual recovery of animal power, this was reduced to 46 mu. In the past, Chahar Province suffered serious damage to animal power due to the plundering of Japanese invaders and Kuomintang bandits. Last year, the Provincial People's Government formulated a plan to breed 90,000 head of livestock, purchased more than 200 excellent breeding horses from other provinces, and established breeding stations. Last year, the province bred 100,500 head of livestock, overfulfilling the breeding plan. In addition, more than 10,700 mu of pasture were planted to solve the problem of livestock feed. Last year, animal diseases occurred in many areas of North China in the spring and autumn, but thanks to the People's Government mobilizing farmers to carry out prevention and control work early, the mortality rate of livestock was greatly reduced compared with 1949. For example, when animal diseases occurred in more than 40 counties, including Yangcheng and Qinshui in Shanxi Province, the Provincial Veterinary Prevention and Control Institute dispatched epidemic prevention teams to the epidemic areas twice, curing more than 4,600 sick animals and vaccinating more than 200,000 head of livestock within three months, thereby eradicating the widespread anthrax, bovine emphysema, and other animal diseases. Xiangyuan County in the province established six veterinary stations. These veterinary stations signed health care contracts with livestock raising households, so that more than 10,000 head of livestock in the county received year-round health insurance. When rinderpest occurred in Yanbei and Chabei special districts in Chahar Province this spring, the spread of rinderpest was quickly stopped due to timely rescue and implementation of blockade and isolation measures.

　　保护和发展畜牧业，防止兽疫。
            西北改良牲畜品种加强疾病防治
    西北各地人民政府由于采取保护牲畜政策，并注意改良牲畜品种和大力进行牲畜防疫注射，去年牲畜死亡率大为减少，且在某些地区畜产量略有增加。
    西北地区是全国著名的畜牧区之一，畜牧业收入占西北农业总收入的百分之三十至四十。但是，过去在国民党反动派的掠夺和压榨下，不但草原遭受破坏，牧区日渐缩小，而且因兽疫流行，牲畜死亡率极大，畜产量的逐年减少，严重地影响了各族牧民的经济生活。
    西北解放后，西北各级人民政府即注意发展畜牧事业，在畜牧区坚决贯彻保护和发展畜牧业的政策，严禁宰杀耕畜、幼畜，并有重点地发放畜牧贷款。去年西北军政委员会畜牧部曾拨发畜牧贷款小米一千另五十万市斤，各地人民政府并进行了改良牲畜品种工作。陕西武功种畜场去年新设了三个配种站（连同原来的八个，现共有十一个），实施人工受精配种，自去年二月到十月，共初配三千七百五十次，复配四千四百七十二次。青海省畜种推广机关五、六月份内也曾给牧民配马种六百三十三次。由于人民政府采取了上述措施，全区牧畜产量正逐渐增加。仅新疆省去年畜产量即较一九四九年增加百分之二十。
    与改良畜种同时，西北各地人民政府还大力开展兽疫防治工作。人民政府先后在各畜产区设立五十八个兽疫防治站、防治处和防治院，另外又成立十一个兽疫防治队，组织六百多名兽医干部分赴兽疫区工作。先后扑灭了陕西、甘肃、宁夏、新疆等省二十多个县内所流行的牛瘟、炭疽、羊痘、猪瘟等各种兽疫。据不完全的统计，去年三月到十一月的九个月内，经过预防注射和治愈的各种牧畜共达六十五万余头。（新华社）
            华北今年繁殖牲畜五十一万余头
    华北区今年繁殖牲畜和防治畜疫的工作获得显著成绩。据不完全的统计：华北全区去年繁殖牲畜达五十一万二千九百多头。该区河北、山西、平原三省经过防疫注射或治愈的牲畜共有一百二十三万余头。
    华北各地人民政府为了恢复与发展农业生产，去年均大力扶助农民从事增殖耕畜的工作。山西省人民政府曾发出牲畜贷粮一百二十余万斤，并设置了四百个配种站，该省沁阳、陵川等四十个县的人民政府在进行配种工作时，还分别召开种畜户座谈会或举办配种训练班，交换和提高配种的经验和技术，从而提高了幼畜的成活率。平原省人民政府在去年一九四九春、秋两季中也曾拨出七百五十二万斤耕畜贷粮帮助农民购买和繁殖耕畜，使全省的耕畜量较一九四九年增加约二十四万头。该省耕畜较少的水灾区，一九四九年每头耕畜平均要耕地六十亩，去年因畜力逐步恢复，即降为四十六亩。察哈尔省以前曾因日寇和国民党匪军的劫掠，畜力遭受严重破坏，去年该省人民政府制订了繁殖牲畜九万头的计划，向外省购入优良种马二百余匹，建立配种站，全省去年繁殖牲畜十万零五千头，超额完成了增殖计划。另外，又推广种植牧草一万零七十余亩，解决了牲畜饲料问题。去年春、秋两季，华北不少地区曾发生畜疫，但由于人民政府发动农民及早进行防治，牲畜死亡率较一九四九年大为减少。如山西省阳城、沁水等四十余县发生畜疫时，该省兽医防治所曾两次派遣防疫队赴疫区工作，三个月内共治愈四千六百余头病畜，并有二十余万头牲畜经过防疫注射，从而扑灭了普遍流行的炭疽、牛气肿疸等畜疫。该省襄垣县建立了六个兽医站。这些兽医站与养畜户订立保健合同，使全县一万余头牲畜得到常年健康保险。察哈尔省雁北、察北专区今春发生牛瘟时，由于及时抢治并实行封锁、隔离的办法，使牛瘟迅速停止蔓延。
