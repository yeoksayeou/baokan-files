Xinhua News Agency report: Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is implementing the "contracting cultivation, contracting grain" substitute farming method and encouraging revolutionary martyrs and military dependents with labor capacity to participate in production, thereby improving the lives of more than 40,000 martyr and military dependents in the region.

The substitute farming method of "contracting cultivation, contracting grain" promoted by various leagues mostly involves martyrs' and military dependents finding their own candidates. The production volume of the substitute farming land is assessed based on the relationship between the substitute farmer and the farmed for, and a contract is signed, with the substitute farmer guaranteeing timely cultivation and delivery of sufficient grain. After the implementation of this method, many substitute farming lands exceeded the original planned yield during last year's autumn harvest due to the deep cultivation and careful work by the farmers. Some martyrs' and military dependents even used the surplus grain to buy carts and horses, or build new houses.

In the work of giving preferential treatment to martyrs' and military dependents in Inner Mongolia, some cadres previously held purely relief-oriented views, which led to a dependency mentality among some military dependents, thereby expanding the substitute farming area and increasing the burden on the masses of farmers. However, since last year, various leagues have strengthened political education for military dependents, encouraged military dependents with labor capacity to participate in production, and earnestly determined the substitute farming candidates, thus greatly reducing the area of substitute farming land. For example, in Jirem League, the number of military dependents' substitute farming households decreased by 57 percent compared to the previous year, and more than 194,000 mu of substitute farming land were cultivated by military dependents with labor capacity themselves. This reduced the burden on the masses of farmers and enabled the masses of farmers to carry out intensive farming on the substitute farming land.

Martyrs' and military dependents in individual areas with particularly difficult living conditions are given assistance by the People's Government from all aspects, so that they can maintain a general standard of living.

### 内蒙实行包耕包粮代耕办法

　　内蒙实行包耕包粮代耕办法
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：内蒙自治区实行“包耕、包粮制”代耕办法，并鼓励有劳动力的革命烈士、军人家属参加生产，使区内四万多户烈属、军属的生活有了改善。
    各盟推行的“包耕、包粮制”的代耕办法，多由烈属、军属自找对象，在代耕者与被代耕者的基础上评定代耕地的生产量，并订立合同，由代耕者保证做到按时耕锄，交足粮食。这种办法实行后，由于农民群众对代耕地深耕细作，使不少代耕地在去年秋收时超过了原订产量。有些烈属、军属还把余粮购车买马，或盖了新房子。
    内蒙在优待烈属、军属的工作中，曾由于某些干部存在单纯救济观点，造成了部分军属的依赖思想，以致扩大了代耕面积，增加了农民群众的负担。但自去年一年来，各盟加强了对军属的政治教育，鼓励有劳动力的军属参加生产，并认真地确定了代耕对象，因而大大地减少了代耕地的面积。如哲里木盟去年军属代耕户较前年减少了百分之五十七，有十九万四千多亩代耕地归有劳动力的军属自行耕种。这样就减轻了农民群众的负担，并因而使农民群众得以在代耕土地上进行精耕细作。
    各地个别生活特别困难的烈属、军属，则由人民政府从各方面给以帮助，使能保持一般的生活水平。
