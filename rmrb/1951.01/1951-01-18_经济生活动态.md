	East China Cotton Yarn Piece-rate Wage Determined by Quality
	The various cotton yarns spun by cotton mills entrusted by the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company East China Branch often do not meet the stipulated quality. Recently, in order to encourage production and improve quality, the company has specifically formulated five measures to stipulate that the piece-rate wage for cotton yarn spinning will be increased or decreased according to the quality. This method is absolutely necessary. (Ning Shi)
	Tongling Winter Business Tax Revenue Entered into Treasury
	In the past, Tongling County, southern Anhui Province, focused on tasks when collecting industrial and commercial taxes. During the evaluation of scores, the phenomenon of large households exploiting small households and small households squeezing large households occurred, and the enthusiasm for paying taxes was very low. After the implementation of the self-reporting, public discussion, and democratic evaluation method for the 1950 winter business tax, the collection started on December 23 last year, and the full amount of tax was reported in three days and entered the treasury within seven days, proving the correctness of the new tax law. (Jiang Yuhua, Wang Yunxian)
	Shanxi Province Tax Bureaus Study New Tax Law
	After the State Council of the Central People's Government promulgated various revised tax laws, the Shanxi Provincial People's Government Taxation Bureau immediately instructed all cadres of tax bureaus throughout the province to conduct in-depth study of the various new tax laws and the "Supporting the New Tax Law and Welcoming New Tasks" editorial of this newspaper, and to conduct regular tests so as to ensure the smooth progress of this year's tax work.

	Fuping Local Products Mostly Sold
	According to a report in the Hebei Daily on January 13: Fuping County, Hebei Province, has suffered from crop disasters for three consecutive years, and the people's lives are difficult and the market is depressed. Since August last year, thanks to the efforts of state-owned enterprises, cooperatives, private merchants, and the masses, most of the county's local products such as peach kernels, apricot kernels, peppercorns, jujubes, wool, down, and medicinal materials have been sold. This not only solved the livelihood problems of the disaster victims, but also promoted the rural sideline production.
	Shandong Distributes 9.1 Million Jin of Disaster Relief Grain
	According to a report in the Jiefang Daily on January 12: In order to help disaster victims overcome the difficulties of winter rain and snow and the period before and after the Spring Festival, and to lay a good foundation for overcoming the spring famine and developing spring plowing, the Shandong Provincial Production and Relief Committee has allocated a batch of disaster relief grain totaling 9.1 million jin of raw grain to various counties based on the disaster situation in various places and the existing amount of relief grain.
