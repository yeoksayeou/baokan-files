　　International Developments
    Malayan People's Armed Forces Active
　　Malayan guerrillas engaged in two battles with British colonial troops in the jungle area of Perak State on the 10th, killing six and wounding three British soldiers. On the night of the 12th, guerrillas attacked a military train traveling from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur in southern Johor State. Guerrillas also attacked the Gulac Klay station twice in Pahang State, and attacked British colonial military vehicles in the Mentakabu area, killing three puppet policemen.
    The Struggle of Peasants in Hyderabad, India
　　Farmers in Telangana (a region of Hyderabad State), India, are continuing their tenacious struggle for land and democracy. 12,000 military police are stationed in the area and are carrying out bloody suppression of those who participate in the liberation struggle and their relatives. Military police cars and motorcycle patrols travel through the countryside every day, conducting searches, chases, and arrests, and even eighty-year-old people are not spared. However, the peasants of Telangana, regardless of the authorities' bloody suppression and rule, are victoriously continuing their struggle. Their main form of struggle is the activity of volunteer guerrillas, with thousands of young men and women fighting in the guerrillas. A police officer admitted that in the Telangana area, the daytime belongs to the police, while the nighttime belongs to the guerrillas.
    American Soldiers Curse American "Politicians"
　　American soldiers invading Korea are expressing increasing "annoyance" at the American warmongers who are driving them to serve as cannon fodder for aggression. United Press correspondent Chapman, who was with the invading Korean American troops, wrote in a telegram from Korea on the 18th: "American soldiers are very annoyed with this Korean War. The object of their annoyance is 'politicians'." American soldiers believe that American "politicians" "are using them as sacrifices. They don't want to be blindfolded." "The GIs say: 'We'll settle the score with these politicians when we get home!'"
    General Secretary of the Dutch Communist Party Criticizes the Dutch Government
　　General Secretary of the Dutch Communist Party, Groot, delivered a speech in parliament on January 16, analyzing the pro-American line implemented by the Dutch government and the harmful consequences this line has had on the Dutch people. Groot said: The Americans have not only dragged the Dutch government into the war of aggression against Korea, but also into the war of aggression against China. This is a disaster for the Dutch people. Groot said: The Dutch people must, together with the Soviet Union and other democratic countries, do everything in their power to stop the rearmament of West Germany and thwart all the imperialists' aggressive plans. Groot demanded that the Dutch government must immediately withdraw its troops from Korea.
    MacArthur Intensifies Arming of Japanese Police
　　MacArthur is stepping up the equipping of the Japanese "Police Reserve Force". The commander of the force, Masuhara Keikichi, revealed at a press conference on the 18th: "Light machine guns have been issued to all barracks of the Police Reserve Force." He also said: "The Police Reserve Force will order 3,000 jeeps and trucks within the current fiscal year ending March 31." It is reported that the "Police Reserve Force" is also learning to use rocket launchers and 155mm heavy artillery, and the United States will supply these weapons "when needed."
