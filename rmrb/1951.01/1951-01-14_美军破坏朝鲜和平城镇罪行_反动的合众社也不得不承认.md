　　American Troops' Crimes of Destroying Peaceful Towns in Korea
    Even the Reactionary Associated Press Had to Admit
    [Xinhua News Agency, 13th] The heinous crimes of the American aggressors in Korea in destroying peaceful towns and villages are something that even reporters from the reactionary American news agency, the Associated Press, cannot deny. AP reporter Moore telegraphed from Tokyo on the 7th: Koreans' "homes have been destroyed, and often more than once. After the factories were destroyed, they had no work to do." They and their families in the front lines or the areas ruled by the US-Li cliques "have become ragged, hungry, and cold wanderers." Who caused such disasters to these peaceful residents? Moore admitted: "It was the Americans who did it." Moore said: The American invading army and its accomplice troops, "whether retreating or advancing," had to "blow up and burn many towns in North Korea and virtually all of its industry." Although Moore shamelessly attempted to defend the atrocities of the American invading army with "due to military needs," he also had to admit: "The Communists (referring to the Chinese and Korean People's Forces) can claim that they have not destroyed Korean towns, and they are quite right in saying so (the facts show that it is 'absolutely correct')," and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army "avoided destructive attacks on towns." In this way, Moore's sophistry was completely refuted by himself.

　　美军破坏朝鲜和平城镇罪行
    反动的合众社也不得不承认
    【新华社十三日讯】美国侵略者在朝鲜破坏和摧毁和平城镇和村庄的万恶罪行，连美国反动通讯社合众社的记者也不得不承认。合众社记者摩尔七日自东京发出电讯说：朝鲜人的“家被毁了，而且常常毁了不止一次。在工厂毁了以后，他们已没有工可做”。他们和他们的家属在前线或美、李匪帮统治区“已变成衣服褴褛、饥寒交迫的飘泊者”。谁使这些和平居民横遭如此的灾难呢？摩尔承认：“是美国人干的”。摩尔说：美国侵略军及其帮凶部队“不管是后退或者前进”，都要“炸毁和烧掉北朝鲜的许多城镇以及实际上它的全部工业”。虽然摩尔无耻地企图用“由于军事上的需要”来为美国侵略军的暴行辩护，但是，他又不得不承认：“共产党人（按指中、朝人民部队）可以声称他们未曾破坏朝鲜的城镇，而且他们这样说也相当正确（事实表明是‘绝对正确’）”，中国人民志愿部队“避免对城镇作破坏性的攻击”。这样，摩尔的狡辩，就被他自己所完全驳倒了。
