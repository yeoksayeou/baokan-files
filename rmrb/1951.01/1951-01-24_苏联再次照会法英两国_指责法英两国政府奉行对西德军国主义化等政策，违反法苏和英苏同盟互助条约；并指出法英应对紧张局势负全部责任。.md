　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 21st: It has been previously reported that on December 15th of last year, the Soviet government separately issued notes to the French and British governments, accusing them of following the United States government in pursuing a policy of remilitarizing West Germany and having it join the North Atlantic aggressive bloc, which violated the foundation and meaning of the Franco-Soviet and Anglo-Soviet treaties of mutual assistance. The notes also reminded the French and British governments that they should bear full responsibility for the situation caused by their violation of the aforementioned treaties. On January 5th of this year, the French Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Chataigneau, and the Chargé d'Affaires of the British Embassy in the Soviet Union, Nicholls, met with the Soviet Minister of Foreign Affairs, Vyshinsky, and delivered the French and British governments' replies to the aforementioned Soviet note. In their replies, the French and British governments vehemently defended their adherence to treaty obligations, and, in a reversal of facts, shifted the responsibility for the tense situation between France, the Soviet Union, Britain, and the Soviet Union onto the Soviet Union, and stated their refusal to bear any responsibility for the current situation.

　　On January 20th of this year, Vyshinsky again invited Chataigneau and Nicholls to meet with him, and delivered to them the Soviet government's second note regarding the French and British governments' replies. In this note, the Soviet government sternly refuted the fabricated arguments in the French and British replies, and reiterated the position held by the Soviet government in the first note.

　　In their replies, both France and Britain argued that the North Atlantic Treaty was "strictly defensive." The Soviet note pointed out that this assertion clearly contradicted the facts. The Soviet note listed facts proving that the French and British governments, together with the United States government, were attempting to conclude a military alliance with the revanchist Adenauer government of West Germany against the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies. Since the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France have not yet signed a peace treaty with Germany, recognizing the end of the state of war with Germany, the illegality of such actions is fully understood by the world. The Soviet note cited irrefutable facts, pointing out that with the participation of the British and French governments, regular German forces headed by Hitler's generals were being established, and West Germany's war industry was being restored. This has caused the revival of German militarism and new attempts to commit aggression against peace-loving peoples. These actions by the French and British governments violated Article 3 of the Franco-Soviet Treaty and the Anglo-Soviet Treaty, both of which stipulate that the contracting parties should act jointly to prevent the recurrence of German aggression. They also violated Article 5 of the Franco-Soviet Treaty and Article 7 of the Anglo-Soviet Treaty, both of which stipulate that neither contracting party shall participate in any alliance or coalition against the other party.

　　In their replies, the French and British governments fabricated the lie that the Soviet Union maintained a large number of troops after the war, using this as a defense for their own rearmament policies. The Soviet note revealed that this was a complete fabrication, and that the fact was that the French and British governments, together with other countries of the North Atlantic Group, were stubbornly opposing the Soviet Union's proposals in the United Nations for disarmament, the prohibition of atomic weapons, the conclusion of a five-power peace pact, and the condemnation of new war propaganda.

　　In its note, the French government shamelessly regarded the Soviet government's recognition of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam as a hostile act towards the French Union. Regarding this point, the Soviet note pointed out that this action by the Soviet Union had nothing to do with the Franco-Soviet Treaty, and cited the fact that even French Foreign Minister Schuman, in his speech to the French National Assembly on March 21st of last year, had to admit that "according to a legal analysis," the Soviet Union "has not violated the Franco-Soviet Treaty."

　　In its note, the British government maliciously described the "World Peace Movement" as subversive activities carried out by the Communist Party in various countries of the world, using this as an excuse for the rearmament activities of the North Atlantic Group. The Soviet note denounced this "frivolous" attempt and pointed out that it was precisely this activity that thwarted the plans of those who were preparing for another world war.

　　After convincingly exposing the various false arguments fabricated by the French and British governments to defend their nefarious activities, the Soviet note solemnly declared that the Soviet government believes that the policies pursued by the French and British governments have undermined the principles and meaning of the "Franco-Soviet Treaty of Mutual Assistance" signed on December 10th, 1944, and the "Anglo-Soviet Treaty of Alliance in the War Against Hitlerite Germany and Its European Associates and of Collaboration and Mutual Assistance After the War" signed on May 26th, 1942. The Soviet government believes that it is necessary to once again remind the French and British governments to abide by the aforementioned treaties, and believes that the French and British governments should bear full responsibility for the situation caused by their violation of the aforementioned treaties.

　　苏联再次照会法英两国
　  指责法英两国政府奉行对西德军国主义化等政策，违反法苏和英苏同盟互助条约；并指出法英应对紧张局势负全部责任。
    【新华社二十三日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科二十一日讯：前已报道，去年十二月十五日，苏联政府曾分别照会法、英两国政府，指责两国政府追随美国政府之后，奉行使西德重新军国主义化并参加北大西洋侵略集团的政策为违反法苏、英苏同盟互助条约的基础与意义，并提醒法英两国政府应对其违反上述条约所造成的情势负全部责任。本年一月五日，法国驻苏大使夏戴纽和英国驻苏大使馆代办尼扣斯晋见苏联外交部部长维辛斯基，以法、英两国政府对上述苏联照会的复文递交维辛斯基。法、英两国政府在复文中，矢口为自己信守条约义务辩护，而颠倒黑白地把法苏、英苏间紧张局势的责任推诿到苏联身上，并表示拒绝应对目前情势负一切责任。
    本年一月二十日，维辛斯基又邀见夏戴纽与尼扣斯，分别将苏联政府就法英两国政府上项复文提出的第二次照会，递交给他们。苏联政府在这个照会中严正地驳复了法英两国复文中的捏造的论点，并重申了苏联政府在第一次照会中所持的立场。
    法英两国的复文中都强辩北大西洋公约是“严格的防御性的”，苏联照会指出这种武断与事实显然抵触。苏联照会列举事实证明法英两国政府会同美国政府正企图与西德复仇主义的阿登纳政府缔结反对苏联和各人民民主国家的军事同盟。而苏、美、英、法四国迄今还没有和德国签订和约，认可对德战争状态之终止，因此这种行动的非法是全世界所充分明了的。苏联照会历举不容辩驳的事实，指出在英法两国政府参与下，以希特勒将领为首的德国正规军正在建立，西德战争工业正在恢复。这造成了德国军国主义的复活和对爱好和平人民进行侵略的新企图。法英两国政府的这种行动违反了法苏条约与英苏条约的第三条，这两条都规定，缔约国应联合行动以防止德国侵略之重起，也违反了法苏条约的第五条与英苏条约的第七条，这两条都规定缔约国一方不得参加反对另一方的任何同盟与联合。
    法国和英国政府在其复文中都捏造苏联在战后维持大量军队的谰言，以此为自己进行的备战政策辩护。苏联照会揭露这是彻头彻尾的捏造，而且事实正是法、英两国政府与其他北大西洋集团国家在一起，在联合国内顽梗地反对苏联关于裁减军备，禁止原子武器缔结五强和平公约，谴责新战争宣传的提案。
    法国政府在其照会中无耻地把苏联政府承认越南民主共和国政府一事认为是对法兰西联邦的敌视行为。对于这一点，苏联照会指出：苏联这种行为与法苏条约没有任何关系，并且举出：连法国外交部长舒曼去年三月二十一日在法国国民议会的发言中都不得不承认“根据法理上的分析”，苏联“并没有违反法苏条约的情事”。
    英国政府在其照会中恶意地把“世界和平运动”说成是共产党在世界各国进行的颠覆性活动，以此作为北大西洋集团进行备战活动的借口。苏联照会痛斥这种“轻率的”企图，并指出正是这种活动挫败了那些准备另一次大战的人们的计划。
    苏联照会在令人信服地揭穿了法英政府为辩护其不可告人的活动而捏造出来的种种虚伪论证以后，郑重申明：苏联政府认为法英两国政府所奉行的政策，已经破坏了一九四四年十二月十日签订的“法苏同盟互助条约”与一九四二年五月二十六日签订的“英苏战时联盟反对希特勒德国及其欧洲与国并在战后合作互助条约”的原则与意义。苏联政府认为有再度唤起法英两国政府遵守上述条约之必要，并认为由于法英两国政府违反上项条约而引起的局势，应由法英两国政府负全部责任。
