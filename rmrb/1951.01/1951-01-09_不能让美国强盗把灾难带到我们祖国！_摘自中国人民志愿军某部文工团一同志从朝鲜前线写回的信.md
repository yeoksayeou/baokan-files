　　We Cannot Allow the American Robbers to Bring Disaster to Our Motherland!
　　——Excerpt from a Letter Written by a Comrade from the Cultural Troupe of a Certain Unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army from the Korean Front
　　We are fighting beautifully, fighting well. You can see it all in the newspapers.

　　It's been a month and a half since we came abroad to perform. We often lead dozens of comrades across mountains and ridges at night, traveling dozens of miles to perform for the soldiers. The environment is quite difficult, but when I think about fighting for human freedom and defending our motherland, I can overcome any difficulty with joy.

　　Now, when we talk about "freedom" and "motherland," these are no longer stiff slogans. In the actual war life, we feel how much mankind needs peace and freedom, and how dear and beautiful our motherland is.

　　Peaceful cities and villages, just a minute before they existed quietly, are turned into scorched earth by American beasts in the blink of an eye... When I see these things, I think about how the people of our motherland can breathe freely in the sun and stride down the street with their heads held high. What a noble freedom and happiness this is!

　　Seeing the Korean people carrying large and small packages, and four or five-year-old children carrying grain on their backs... Seeing these things, I think of the children of our motherland reading books, looking at paintings, and living happily in warm houses, which further increases my will to fight for peace.

　　Strive for freedom of survival for mankind, and avenge the free people!

　　We will never allow the aggressors, the American robbers, to bring disaster to our motherland!

　　The ferocity and cruelty of American imperialism have increased my hatred, making me more concerned and miss our motherland even more. I often dream of the cities of our motherland, and the sunflower leaves in the fields that look like elephant ears; sometimes I also dream of American planes flying into the sky over our motherland, and I grab my gun to fight, waking up arguing and cursing.

　　We often hear foreign friends say the great name "Mao Zedong." Hearing this name, I feel covered in glory!

　　Now we are advancing victoriously, and I believe I will see you all well in the days of victory.

### 不能让美国强盗把灾难带到我们祖国！——摘自中国人民志愿军某部文工团一同志从朝鲜前线写回的信

　　不能让美国强盗把灾难带到我们祖国！
    ——摘自中国人民志愿军某部文工团一同志从朝鲜前线写回的信
    我们的仗打得漂亮，打得好，在报纸上你们都能看见了。
    出国演戏一个半月了，经常夜里带着几十个同志翻山越岭，跑几十里路给战士们演戏。环境相当困难，但是想到为人类的自由，为了捍卫祖国，什么困难都能愉快地克服。
    现在说起“自由”、“祖国”这些名词，已经不是生硬的口号了。在实际战争生活里，我们感到人类是多么需要和平、自由，祖国是多么亲切美好。
    和平的城市、乡村，一分钟前还安静地存在着，转眼之间，就被美国野兽摧残成焦土……一看到这些，我便想到我们祖国的人民能在太阳里自由呼吸，能挺着腰板在马路上迈步，这该是多么高贵的自由幸福！
    看到朝鲜人民，背着大小包裹，四五岁的小孩子驮着粮食……看到这一些，我便想到祖国的孩子们读书、看画，在和暖的屋子里过着幸福的生活，使我更增加了为和平而斗争的意志。
    为人类争取生存的自由，为自由的人民复仇！
    我们决不允许侵略者、美国强盗把灾难送进我们的祖国！
    美帝的凶暴残忍，增加了我的仇恨，使我更关怀、惦念着我们的祖国。经常在梦里梦见祖国的城市，田地里象象耳朵一样的向日葵叶子；有时也梦到美国飞机飞进祖国的上空，便抓起枪来要打，吵着骂着醒来。
    我们时常听见，从外国朋友的嘴里说出“毛泽东”这个伟大的名字，听见这个名字，就感到满身披着光荣！
    现在我们在胜利前进，相信我会很好地在胜利的日子里看到你们。
