　　Immortal Deeds of Chinese and Korean People's Fighters
　　Yang Guichang and other warriors continuously repelled six enemy counterattacks
　　(Korea, Jin Yingbian)
　　Having suffered defeat at Flying Tiger Mountain, the enemy, in order to pass through a certain high ground on the only escape route, fiercely began to attack our army, which was ambushed there in advance. At daybreak, the enemy mobilized various cannons and heavy weapons and began to bombard our positions. Enemy shells exploded like rain around our army. At the same time, enemy planes flew in groups, beginning to bomb indiscriminately and strafe with machine guns.
　　The enemy infantry had already rushed to within a few hundred meters of our army. Four hundred meters… three hundred meters… two hundred meters… the squad finally issued the order to fire.
　　At this time, our army fighters accurately hit their targets, firing bullets like a storm. But the enemy hordes, relying on their numerical superiority, desperately charged. Enemy planes provided cover for the enemy's attack, strafing.
　　A fierce battle unfolded. Our army constantly shattered the enemy's mad attempts. Chinese People's Volunteer Army fighter Yang Guichang was at the forefront of this battle.
　　But fighter Yang Guichang ran out of bullets.
　　"Give me bullets! We can't let the bastards climb up here!" he shouted to the fighters beside him for bullets. After getting bullets, he quickly returned to his position.
　　Enemy shells exploded in the sky from time to time. Fighter Yang Guichang took advantage of the enemy's frantic shelling to aim accurately and fire fiercely at the enemy.
　　The intense firing of all our army's artillery again repelled the enemy's counterattack. The enemy gathered their dying soldiers and stubbornly began a third counterattack.
　　At this time, Comrade Yang Guichang stood up from the trench and shouted, "Brave comrades, avenge the sacrificed comrades, charge forward!" and ran down from the high ground. Filled with boundless hatred for the comrades' casualties, the fighters shouted together and jumped out of the trenches.
　　A fierce melee unfolded between the high grounds.
　　After fighting hand-to-hand for more than two hours, the enemy's corpses quickly filled the valley. Frightened by the brave hand-to-hand combat of our army combatants, the enemy began a general rout. Our army fired at the retreating enemy, firing furiously!
　　The enemy's front and rear five counterattacks had already been repelled. The enemy again began to charge towards this high ground.
　　Yang Guichang and other fighters, taking grenades, circled around the enemy's position and began a surprise attack.
　　Yang Guichang crawled forward towards the back of the high ground.
　　When approaching the enemy position fifty meters away, Yang Guichang shouted slogans and rushed into the enemy's formation! The panicked enemy threw away their guns and grenades. They began to scatter again.
　　Yang Guichang threw four grenades at the enemy, eliminating more than forty enemies at once.
　　At this time, a hateful bullet pierced Yang Guichang's arm.
　　However, Yang Guichang ignored the pain and bravely stabbed more than ten enemies to death, and the enemy was finally repelled again.
　　Yang Guichang and other brave combatants thus defended a certain high ground with their own flesh and blood, cutting off the enemy's retreat and creating favorable conditions for our army to encircle and annihilate the enemy. (Translated by Cui Bin from the December 25th "Democratic Korea" newspaper)
　　　　Communist Party Member Comrade Shen Yongfu Sacrifices Himself to Blow Up Enemy Tank (Kai Feng)
　　Shen Yongfu, deputy squad leader of the seventh company of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, heroically killed the enemy and died a glorious death in the battle to encircle and annihilate the U.S. invading army's 7th Division in Xinxingli on the east bank of Changjin Lake, demonstrating the noble qualities of a Communist Party member.
　　On the night of November 27th, the seventh company of a certain unit of our People's Volunteer Army was ordered to cut off the enemy's retreat in Xinxingli and encircle and annihilate the enemy. After crossing several major mountains, the advance guard discovered a solitary wooden house. Shen Yongfu, deputy squad leader of the third platoon, who was walking at the front of the troop, led his combat team to guardedly go forward to occupy the wooden house. When they were about twenty meters away from the wooden house, a rain of bullets suddenly shot out from the house. The enemy had constructed a firing point here with ten machine guns and automatic rifles, attempting to block our army's attack on Xinxingli. Shen Yongfu quickly observed the situation and immediately led his combat team into battle. They cleverly avoided the enemy's firepower, fired a volley of grenades and submachine guns, and then rushed into the house like tigers, occupying the position and killing eight American soldiers. Shen Yongfu unceasingly raised his submachine gun and chased after the fleeing enemy. But when he was more than forty meters away from the wooden house, a shell exploded beside him, and shrapnel broke his right leg bone. He fainted, and blood stained the snow beside him red.
　　Just as the rear troops arrived near the wooden house, an enemy tank had already driven from the right side of the road beside Xinxingli village, covering more than a hundred American soldiers in a counterattack on the seventh company. The battle unfolded, and in an instant, many American soldiers' corpses had fallen on the snow-covered ground.
　　This road was the enemy's only retreat, so the enemy, still under the cover of the tank, frantically attacked.
　　The enemy scattered and hid behind the tank, suddenly attacking the wooden house. Shen Yongfu, exposed in front of the front line, woke up in the heavy rumble. In the dawn, he saw more than a dozen American soldiers closely following behind the enemy tank. He knew that these besieged enemy soldiers had to be annihilated here, and not a single one could be allowed to escape. He endured the excruciating pain, raised his submachine gun, and pushed in a bullet to sweep towards the American soldiers hiding behind the tank. But when he pulled the trigger for the third time, there were no more bullets in the chamber. The tank had already driven towards him, and bullets splashed ice and snow beside him. He hurriedly felt behind him and found the only grenade left. He did not hesitate for a moment to prop himself up with both hands and crawl forward, even though his injured leg had already been stiffened by frozen blood. At this moment, Shen Yongfu destroyed his beloved submachine gun, bit open the grenade cover with his teeth, and licked out the firing pin with his tongue.
　　The tank drove towards Shen Yongfu, stirring up wind and snow. Five steps—three steps—one step—"Boom"! Ice, snow, dirt, and the hero Shen Yongfu's blood flew up under the tank's wheels, the tank shook a few times, and then died there.
　　The machine gun on the high ground on the right howled violently, the soldiers of the seventh company charged forward, shooting and killing the enemy who had lost cover and advancing rapidly towards Xinxingli.

　　中朝人民战士们不朽的功绩
    以杨贵长为首的勇士们连续击退敌人六次反击
   （朝鲜  金应变）
    在飞虎山战斗吃了败仗的敌人，为了通过唯一的退路上的某高地，猛烈地开始攻击预先埋伏在该地的我军。天一亮，敌人就动员了各种炮和重武器，向我阵地开始猛烈射击。敌人的炮弹像雨似地在我军前后落下来爆炸。同时，敌人的飞机也成群飞来，开始滥炸和用机枪扫射。
    敌人的步兵已经冲到离我军几百公尺的前方。四百公尺……三百公尺……二百公尺……，小队终于下了射击命令。
    这时候，我军战士们命中射击，像风暴一样把子弹射出去。但是只靠数量上占优势的敌人野兽群，拼命地冲上来。敌机掩护着敌人的进攻，扫射着。
    激烈的战斗展开了。我军不断粉碎敌人疯狂的企图。中国人民志愿军战士杨贵长就在这战斗的最前头。
    但是战士杨贵长打完了子弹。
    “给我子弹吧！我们不要让混蛋们爬上一个来！”他向旁的战士高喊着要子弹。要了子弹后，迅速地回到自己的位置。
    敌人的炮弹不时地在上空爆炸。杨贵长战士利用敌人疯狂地打炮的时候，以准确的瞄准，向敌人猛烈地射击。
    我军所有炮火的猛烈射击，再度打退了敌人的反攻。敌人聚拢了垂死着的士兵，执拗地又开始第三次反击。
    杨贵长同志，就在这时候从战壕中站起来，高喊着“勇敢的战友们，为牺牲的同志报仇吧，冲锋前进！”从高地跑下去了。为了同志们的伤亡而怀着无限仇恨的战士们，一齐高喊着，跳出战壕。
    高地和高地之间，展开了激烈的厮杀。
    打了两个多钟头的肉搏战后，敌人的尸首快填满了山谷。被我军战斗员勇敢的肉搏战吓坏了的敌人，开始总溃退。我军向着溃退的敌人，射击，愤怒地射击！
    已经打退了敌人前后五次的反击。敌人又向这高地开始冲上来了。
    杨贵长和其他战士们拿着手榴弹，迂回敌阵地，开始奇袭。
    杨贵长向着高地背陵，匍匐前进。
    迫近敌阵五十公尺时，杨贵长高喊着口号，冲进敌阵去了！惊惶的敌人，扔掉枪和手榴弹。又开始逃散了。
    杨贵长向敌人扔了四个手榴弹，一下子消灭了四十多个敌人。
    就在这时候，可恶的子弹打穿了杨贵长的胳膊。
    但是，杨贵长不顾伤疼，奋勇地又刺杀了十多个敌人，敌人终于又被击退了。
    以杨贵长为首的勇敢的战斗员们，这样以自己的血肉守住了某高地，截断敌人的退路，造成了我军围歼敌人的有利条件。（崔彬译自十二月二十五日《民主朝鲜》报）
            共产党员沈永福同志壮烈舍身炸毁敌坦克（凯风）
    中国人民志愿军某部七连副班长沈永福，在长津湖东岸新兴里围歼美国侵略军第七师的战斗中，英勇杀敌壮烈牺牲，表现了共产党员的崇高品质。
    十一月二十七日夜，我人民志愿军某部七连奉命切断新兴里敌人的退路，围歼敌人。在翻越几重大山之后，前哨部队发现了一座孤独的小木屋。走在部队最前面的三排副班长沈永福，领着他的战斗组，警戒地前进去占领这座木屋。在进到木屋前约二十米达的地方，突然从屋里射出了弹雨，敌军在这里用十挺机枪和自动步枪构成了一个火力点，企图阻挡我军向新兴里攻击。沈永福迅速观察了情况，立即率领他的战斗小组进入战斗。他们机敏地避开敌人的火力，打出一排手榴弹和冲锋枪后，就像猛虎一样地冲进屋内，占领了阵地，打死了八个美国兵。沈永福一刻不停地提起冲锋枪向逃散的敌人追去。但在离开木屋四十多米的地方，一颗炮弹在他身旁爆炸，弹片打折了他的右腿骨，他昏倒了下去，鲜血染红了他身旁的雪地。
    后面部队刚刚赶到木屋附近时，新兴里村旁的公路右侧已经开来了一辆敌人坦克，掩护着一百多个美国兵向七连反扑。战斗展开了，一霎时雪覆的大地上已倒下了许多美国兵的尸体。
    这条路是敌人唯一的退路，因此，敌人仍然在坦克的掩护下，疯狂猛扑。
    敌人散了开来，躲在坦克后面向着木屋突来。暴露在阵线前沿的沈永福在沉重的隆隆声中苏醒过来了，他在晨曦中看见敌人坦克后面紧随着十多个美国兵。他知道，必须在这里歼灭掉这些被围的敌兵，不准逃掉一个。他忍着剧痛端起冲锋枪，推上子弹向躲在坦克后面的美国兵扫去。但当第三次勾扳机的时候，枪膛已经没有子弹了。坦克已经向他开来，子弹在他身旁溅起了冰雪。他急急向背后一摸，摸着了仅剩的一颗手榴弹。他一刻不犹豫地用两手撑起身子向前爬去，虽然他的伤腿已经被冰冻的血液凝得僵硬了。就在这个时候，沈永福破坏了他心爱的冲锋枪，用牙咬开了手榴弹盖，用舌尖舐出了弹弦。
    坦克卷着风雪向沈永福驰来。五步——三步——一步——“轰”！在坦克车轮带的下面飞起了冰雪、土块和英雄沈永福的鲜血，坦克震动了几下，就死在那儿了。
    右面高地上的机枪狂烈的叫啸着，七连的战士们冲锋前进，射杀着失去掩护的敌人向新兴里疾进。
