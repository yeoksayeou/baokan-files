    Irresponsible Maintenance Foreman Leads to Train Derailment in Baichengzi

    On the morning of January 10th at 5:31 AM, the No. 254 train on the Jinzhou Railway Bureau's Bai-A Line derailed in a major accident at kilometer 23 and 500 meters between Pingtai and Ping'an Town due to damaged tracks. A total of one passenger car and four freight cars overturned, and two passenger cars and seven freight cars derailed. Sixty meters of track were destroyed. Two passengers were slightly injured. The accident affected the operation of trains No. 251 and No. 252 for one day, resulting in losses of approximately 1.4 billion Northeast Yuan. The cause of the accident was that the 32-kilogram B-type steel rails on the Bai-A Line of the Baichengzi Engineering Section had exceeded their service life. During the major inspections in the spring and autumn, the section repeatedly instructed the foremen of each work zone to conduct thorough inspections; however, this did not attract the attention of Zhang Shusen, the maintenance foreman of the Ping'an Town work zone. In order to repair the switches, they neglected to inspect the steel rails at kilometer 3 and 500 meters and reported to the supervisor that "the entire inspection has been completed." The supervisor's work was not thorough, and he did not discover the problem. In reality, the outer lower side of the rail head in the neglected area had cracks of three to four hundred millimeters, which could not withstand the pressure of the train, thus causing the accident. After the accident occurred, the foreman initially denied the neglect, but he was speechless after evidence was found. The work zone's labor discipline was usually lax, and the foreman had not inspected the tracks at the south end of the work zone (the location of the accident) for nine consecutive days. He did not understand the condition of the tracks. When asked how many damaged rails (damaged steel rails) were in his jurisdiction, he said, "The work zone has records." When asked how many damaged rails the track patrollers should pay attention to, their answer was "I don't know." On the day of the accident, the track patroller Ji Bingjun was supposed to start work at 4:00 AM, but he was an hour late because of baking flatbreads and keeping warm. We asked the workers: "The foreman doesn't inspect the steel rails, why doesn't everyone raise objections? Don't you know the importance of inspecting steel rails?" The workers replied: "How would we know those things!" This shows that the work arranged by the section at the foreman's joint meeting was not well communicated by the foremen when they returned. In the past, the section's cadres lacked supervision and inspection of their work, and the rewards and punishments were not strict, leading to lax labor discipline. Some cadres did not fully promote democracy, and subordinates were afraid to report anything, and when they did report, it was mostly good news rather than bad. Some work zone foremen did not personally lead on-site, but relied solely on reports. These were all remote causes of the accident. For this reason, the section specially convened a joint meeting of foremen and supervisors on the 15th to examine these errors and fight for the complete elimination of accidents and to ensure transportation safety.

### 养路工长不负责任  白城子发生覆车事故

    养路工长不负责任
    白城子发生覆车事故
    一月十日早晨五点三十一分，锦州铁路局白阿线第二五四次列车在平台、平安镇间二三公里五百米处，因轨道损坏，发生了覆车的重大事故。计：颠覆客车一辆、货车四辆，脱线的有客车二辆货车七辆。线路破坏六十米。旅客轻伤二名。影响二五一、二五二次列车运休一日，损失达东北币十四亿左右。事故发生的原因是：本来白城子工务段白阿线三二公斤Ｂ型的钢轨已超过使用年限，在春秋两季大检查时，段上曾再三指示各工区工长认真检查；但并未引起平安镇养路工区工长张树森的注意。为了修理道岔，他们竟漏检了三公里五○○米的钢轨，而向监工员汇报说“全部检查完了”。监工员工作不深入，也未发现。实际上漏检区钢轨头部外侧下有三四○公里的裂痕，经不起列车的震压，因而造成事故。事故发生以后，工长还不承认漏检，经调查出证据后才无话可说。该养路工区平日劳动纪律松懈，工长已连续九天没到工区南头（事故发生的地点）检查线路。他对线路情形不了解，问他管内有多少伤铁（损伤钢轨），他说“工区有账啊”。问巡道员本管内有多少应当注意的伤铁？他们的回答是“不知道”。出事故这天，巡道员计秉钧应早晨四点出动，但因烤大饼及取暖迟走了一个钟头。我们问工友：“工长不检查钢轨，大家怎不提出意见，不知道检查钢轨的重要吗？”工友们回答：“那知道那些事啊”！这说明段上在工长联席会上布置的工作，工长回去并未很好传达。该段干部过去对工作缺少督促检查，奖惩不严格，以致劳动纪律松驰。有的干部没有充分发扬民主，下级有什么事不敢反映，就是反映也多是报喜不报忧。有的工区工长不亲入现场领导，专门凭报告办事，这些都是造成事故的远因。为此，段上特地在十五日召开工长、监工员联席会，检查这些错误，为彻底消灭事故、保证运输安全而斗争。
