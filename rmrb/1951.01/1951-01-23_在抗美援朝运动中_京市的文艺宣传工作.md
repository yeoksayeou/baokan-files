In the Resist America, Aid Korea, and Protect the Home movement, Beijing launched an unprecedented large-scale literary and artistic propaganda campaign and achieved great results. This activity began in early November of last year. Literary and artistic groups, writers, poets, painters, actors, artists, and the vast number of literary enthusiasts among workers, students, and teachers in the capital enthusiastically and universally participated in this activity.

Under the leadership of the Beijing Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression, a thousand professional literary and artistic workers from units such as the Central Academy of Drama, the China Youth Art Theatre, the Beijing People's Art Theatre, the Beijing Opera Circle, and the Central Academy of Fine Arts formed ten Resist America, Aid Korea literary and artistic propaganda teams, performing their own creations in thirty-two locations in the urban area and suburban factories, mines, and rural areas. They performed a total of eighty-eight shows over twenty-six days, with an audience of over 140,000 people. Some of the more successful works included the drama "Mother's Heart," "Brotherly Friendship," the drum ballad "Fisherman's Hatred," "Blood Debt for Blood," "Four Guns," the crosstalk "So Is America," and others. The teachers and students of the Central Academy of Fine Arts completed two thousand cartoons and posters, and the professors collectively created four large paintings and thirty-five "Histories of American Imperialist Aggression Against China." In addition to holding an "Resist America, Aid Korea Art Exhibition," the art community of the capital posted and exhibited their works in every corner of the city.

Various factories, in coordination with accelerating production, also adopted a variety of methods to carry out Resist America, Aid Korea literary and artistic activities. There were literary and artistic performances before current affairs forums, summary meetings, and accusation meetings. Some factories also used the time between noon and after work to regularly hold song and allegro performances. Each factory had the creation and reproduction of comic strips and cartoons. Workers created nearly two hundred Resist America, Aid Korea literary and artistic works, among which the most popular among the masses were: the drama "Turning Grief into Strength" by the Beijing-Tianjin Railway Bureau, "Blood Debt" by the Shijingshan Power Plant, the song "Blood Debt Must Be Paid" by the Beijing Telecommunications Bureau, the storytelling "Tearful Memories" and "Avenue Oddity" by the Public Bus Company, and the allegro "Red Flags All Over the World" by the Agricultural Machinery Factory, and the allegro "Launch a New Record Movement to Answer American Imperialist Aggression" by the Printing Factory of the Political Department of the North China Military Region.

The literary and artistic activities of students in the capital to Resist America and Aid Korea were the largest and most active in this movement. Nearly 100,000 students (including some professors and teachers) from more than ten universities and more than eighty secondary schools in the city participated in propaganda activities. From November 7th to 19th alone, more than 20,000 students from twenty-four schools formed 124 teams to carry out propaganda; among them, Peking University alone dispatched 1,900 people 270 times, conducting propaganda to 130,000 citizens. In addition to conducting literary and artistic propaganda to the masses, students from various schools also conducted many family visits using singing and storytelling. Students created hundreds of works in their literary and artistic propaganda activities, and the more successful works included: the drama "Young Guerrillas" by the Municipal No. 8 Middle School, "As Long As the Mountains Are Still There" by the Peking University Medical College, the allegro "Resist America, Aid Korea" by the Normal University, "We Want to Live a Good Life" by Yu Ying, and the poem "Hatred" by Tsinghua University.

In addition, the film industry in the capital held an "Resist America, Aid Korea Film Propaganda Month" from November to December last year, screening dozens of films such as "Daughters of China," with an audience of 640,000 people.

On December 10th, more than 3,000 people from the literary and art circles in the capital held a demonstration parade to celebrate the liberation of Pyongyang, expressing the strength and determination of literary and art workers to use all literary and artistic weapons to further attack the aggressors and defend world peace.

This activity, with a magnificent posture, penetrated deeply into every street, factory, mine, and rural area in the urban area and suburbs of the capital. The student propaganda teams traveled as far as Changxindian, Nankou, and Changping, and also carried out onboard propaganda on the Beijing-Tianjin railway. Through this literary and artistic propaganda activity, the broad masses of citizens had a relatively clear understanding of the significance of resisting America, aiding Korea, and protecting the homeland, clarified the pro-American and fear-of-American thoughts of some citizens, laid the foundation for patriotic ideological education, and enabled the broad masses of citizens to break through their concerns and actively participate in practical actions to protect their homes and defend their country. For example, the movement of workers and students to participate in military cadre schools and the donation movement to comfort the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army have achieved greater results due to the cooperation of literary and artistic propaganda. At present, the Beijing Municipal People's Government Literary and Art Office and professional literary and art groups in the capital are strengthening contact with various factories and schools, and plan to conduct more organized literary and artistic propaganda activities to the broad masses of citizens, workers, and peasants during the Spring Festival.

　　在抗美援朝运动中
    京市的文艺宣传工作
    在抗美援朝保家卫国运动中，首都展开空前大规模的文艺宣传活动，并获得巨大的成绩。这一活动是从去年十一月初开始的。首都的文艺团体、作家、诗人、画家、演员、艺人以及广大的爱好文艺的工人、学生和教师们都热烈地、普遍地参加了这一活动。
    在中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会北京分会的领导下，由中央戏剧学院、中国青年艺术剧院、北京人民艺术剧院、北京戏曲界、中央美术学院等单位的专业文艺工作者一千人组成了十个抗美援朝文艺宣传队，在城区及市郊的厂矿、农村等三十二个地方，演出了自己的创作。他们前后演出二十六天共八十八场，观众在十四万人以上。其中比较成功的作品有话剧“母亲的心”、“兄弟之谊”，鼓词“渔夫恨”、“血债血还”、“四只枪儿”，相声“如此美国”等。中央美术学院的师生完成了二千张漫画、招贴画，教授集体创作了四幅大画和三十五幅“美帝侵华史”。首都的美术界除举办了一次“抗美援朝美术展览会”外，并在全市每一角落张贴和展览了他们的作品。
    各工厂配合加紧生产，也采取多种多样的方式展开了抗美援朝文艺活动。在时事座谈会、总结会、控诉会前都有文艺节目的表演，有的工厂还利用中午上下班间的时间经常举行歌曲、快板演唱，各工厂都有连环画、漫画的创作与复制。工人创作的抗美援朝文艺作品将近二百件，其中最受群众欢迎的：话剧有京津铁路局的“化悲愤为力量”、石景山发电厂的“血债”，歌曲有北京电信局的“血债要还”，说唱有公共汽车公司的“血泪回忆”、“大道奇”，快板有农业机械厂的“红旗插遍满天下”、华北军区政治部印刷厂的快板“开展新纪录运动回答美帝侵略暴行”。
    首都学生的抗美援朝的文艺活动，是这次运动中最庞大也最活跃的。全市十余所高等学校八十余所中等学校的学生（包括一部分教授、教员）近十万人参加了宣传活动。仅十一月七日到十九日就有二十四个学校的两万多学生编成一百二十四个队出动宣传；其中北京大学一个学校就有一千九百人出动二百七十次，对十三万市民作了宣传。各校学生除对群众作文艺宣传外，还分别利用唱歌、讲故事进行了许多次家庭访问。学生的文艺宣传活动中创作各种作品数百件，比较成功的作品：话剧有市立第八中学的“青年游击队员”、北京大学医学院的“只要山还在”，快板有师范大学的“抗美援朝”、育英的“咱们要过好日子”，诗歌有清华大学的“仇”。
    此外首都的电影界在去年十一月到十二月间，举办了“抗美援朝电影宣传月”，放映“中华女儿”等数十种影片，观众达六十四万人。
    十二月十日，首都的文艺界三千多人，举行了庆祝平壤解放示威大游行，表示了文艺工作者要运用一切文艺武器更进一步的打击侵略者，保卫世界和平的力量和决心。
    这次活动以波澜壮阔的姿态，普遍深入到首都城区及市郊的每一个街巷、厂矿、农村。学生的宣传队伍并远到长辛店、南口、昌平等地，还在京津线火车上作了随车宣传。经过这次文艺宣传活动，广大的市民群众对抗美援朝保家卫国的意义都有了比较明确的认识，澄清了一部分市民的崇美、恐美思想，奠定了爱国主义思想教育的基础，使广大市民打破了顾虑，积极地参加保家卫国的实际行动。比如工人、学生参加军事干部学校的运动，慰劳朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿部队的捐献运动，都因文艺宣传的配合而获得了更大的成绩。目前北京市人民政府文艺处和首都的专业文艺团体正在加强与各工厂、学校联系，计划在春节时更有组织地对广大的市民、工人、农民进行文艺宣传活动。
