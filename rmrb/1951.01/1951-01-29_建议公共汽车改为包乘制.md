    Suggesting Public Buses Be Changed to a Contract Responsibility System
    On the 20th of this month, I took the Beijing public bus from Wanshou Mountain to Donghuamen. I discovered that the footboard at the bus door had cracks and was loose, which looked very dangerous. At the time, I asked the ticket seller why it wasn't repaired? He said, "We may not be driving this bus tomorrow, so we don't care." Later, the bus broke down halfway, and it took half an hour to continue driving. When I was waiting for the bus at the station, I heard passengers say, "We have no confidence in waiting for the public bus, they are often delayed." According to my understanding: public bus ticket sellers and drivers are on a shift system, and after their shift, they hand over the bus regardless of its condition. The people on the next shift have to repair the bus before driving, so they cannot drive on time. Therefore, I suggest that the Beijing Public Bus Company adopt a contract responsibility system like the railway. Several people should be assigned to operate a fixed bus. This would have three benefits: First, it would increase the sense of responsibility of the crew and ensure that the bus drives on time, without delaying the passengers' time; Second, it would cultivate the crew's habit of diligently repairing vehicles and cherishing state property; Third, through the contract responsibility system, it would be easier to reward the good and criticize the bad, so that everyone can compete with each other.

### 建议公共汽车改为包乘制

　　建议公共汽车改为包乘制
    本月二十日，我乘京市公共汽车从万寿山到东华门。我发现车门的踏脚处已有裂痕，并且已活动，看样子很危险。当时我问卖票员为什么不修理？他说：“明天我们就不一定开这辆车，我们不管。”后来车开到中途时果然坏了，耽误了半点钟才继续开车。当我在车站等车时便听见乘客们说：“我们对等公共汽车没有信心，他们经常误点。”据了解：公共汽车卖票和司机都是轮班制，乘务完了不管车的好坏就交了班。上班的人不得不先将车子修理好了再开车，所以不能按时开车。因此我建议京市公共汽车公司采用和火车一样的包乘制。由几个人固定开一辆车。这样可以有三个好处：一、乘务员提高责任心，能保证准时间开车，不耽误乘客的时间；二、养成乘务员勤于修理车辆，爱护国家财富的习惯；三、通过包乘制，易于奖励好的，批评坏的，使大家互相竞赛。
