　　In the aggressive activities carried out by American imperialism on a global scale, the forms it manifests are nothing more than two types: open and blatant armed aggression and hidden and circuitous sabotage activities. Hidden and circuitous sabotage activities are an important component of American imperialism's policy of aggression. Because this type of aggressive activity wears various disguises, it is often difficult for the people of the invaded countries to recognize its true face for a time, mistaking the robber in cassock for their friend, and therefore losing vigilance against its sabotage activities and neglecting prevention.
　　For readers who do not usually pay much attention to the hidden sabotage activities of imperialism, I would like to recommend "The Secret of American Diplomats" and "The Great Anti-Soviet Conspiracy." These two books will help us to recognize the true face of American imperialism. The authors of both books are Americans who, based on their personal experiences or according to many undeniable facts, exposed the deep hatred of American imperialism and other imperialists for the cause of people's revolution, and the insidious and despicable sabotage that they had carried out against the liberated Soviet people. These blood-stained bandits also used to and still want to dress themselves up as compassionate saviors in front of the Chinese people.
　　The author of "The Secret of American Diplomats," Ms. Bukaer, is a "native-born American." She once worked in the intelligence agency of the U.S. State Department and worked in the U.S. Embassy in Moscow for two years, witnessing the criminal activities carried out by the U.S. Embassy in Moscow under the protection of diplomatic privileges. She has the good wishes shared by the American people, hoping that the people of the world can live in peace and hoping that the United States and the Soviet Union can maintain friendly relations; but from her own personal experience and daily work, she clearly recognized that the American imperialist ruling clique, in its hidden sabotage against the Soviet people, was leading the world to a cruel war: "I see how the American diplomats responsible for American foreign policy are doing everything in their power to gradually realize that world catastrophe. Their policies have always been directed against the Soviet Union; they deliberately sabotage world peace and suppress the struggle of all nations around the world for happiness and a better life." The author pointed out the reason why American diplomats hate the Soviet Union so much, because "these diplomats have now realized that what is stopping the American billionaires from ruling the world is the Soviet Union." In order to realize the dream of Wall Street bosses to enslave all mankind, it is inevitable to carry out various open and hidden aggressive activities against the Soviet Union, the vanguard of the world's peaceful and democratic forces. From these criminal activities, Ms. Bukaer realized that the actions of the American reactionary ruling clique were completely contrary to the hopes of the American people; after a complex struggle of self-thought, "abandoning all personal and emotional concerns," she realized that she should no longer execute the orders of the warmongers, so as not to "bear part of the criminal responsibility for the people of the world." She bravely protested against the activities of American warmongers with her actions, resigned from the U.S. Embassy in 1948, and decided to stay in the Soviet Union for a long time. She announced to the peace-loving people of the world: "Taking such steps gives me the opportunity to effectively participate in the struggle against the warmongers." "Here, I can dedicate myself to the struggle for peace and world prosperity."
　　Although the author of this book, due to the limitations of personal experience, has not revealed the hidden sabotage activities carried out by the American imperialists in the Soviet Union in a comprehensive and extensive way, but precisely because what she revealed are her "personal experiences," this book has a very simple and sincere touching power. It tells us how American imperialists, under the guise of diplomatic personnel, news reporters, and Red Cross workers, carry out their conspiracy activities. When the anti-fascist war was still going on, the Strategic Affairs Bureau, the U.S. intelligence agency, under the leadership of American monopoly capitalists, had become a reactionary nest, "specializing in training intelligence personnel and organizing other sabotage work to engage in anti-Soviet activities." In the U.S. State Department, monopoly capitalists supported a small number of conspirators who were extremely hostile to the Soviet Union. This small group of anti-Soviet elements, composed of the "monopolists of U.S.-Soviet relations," "completely controlled the power of employment in the State Department and the U.S. Embassy in Moscow." Under the manipulation of this group, "for almost all major events, with very few exceptions, they have always been able to forcibly implement their anti-Soviet line."
　　In order to advance the imperialist policy, these reactionary elements hoped to cover the eyes and ears of the people of the world with one hand, and wanted to deceive the American people and the people of the world about the truth of the Soviet Union, spreading the poisonous fog of hostility towards the Soviet Union. By reversing right and wrong and confusing black and white, they fabricated all kinds of rumors and spread false reports that slandered and slandered the Soviet Union. "They believe that as long as they fully and repeatedly carry out all kinds of malicious slander propaganda against the Soviet Union, it will eventually be accepted as the truth by the general American people." The author pointed out accurately that the reason why reactionary elements want to cover up the truth about the Soviet Union among the American people is because "the sixty families that control all political and economic power are deeply afraid that the example of the Soviet Union will be "contagious." If the American people find that in a socialist and communist society, people live better and enjoy greater freedom than under capitalism, they may try to take over all the means of production and power in the United States." The ruling group of American imperialism yearns to lead the American people from deception and concealment into a war adventure to seek excess profits for monopoly capital.
　　The book reveals the situation of American imperialist secret agents carrying out hidden sabotage in various forms. In conversations with those few simple-minded and lacking vigilance people, they skillfully explore the garrison of the army, the living standards and conditions of the army, and everything else of intelligence value; the speakers unknowingly become the news reporters of these secret agents. These secret agents "always pay attention to careless and simple-minded people, and skillfully drag them into the mud." Another part of the secret agents disguise themselves as friendly to the Soviet Union in order to gain the trust of those who approach them, and then obtain secret information from daily interactions. This revelation is indeed still relatively superficial, but the victorious Chinese people should be fully vigilant from this.
　　Under the high vigilance of the Soviet state and people, the hidden sabotage of American imperialism against the Soviet Union has been constantly exposed and given due blows, but as the author of this book pointed out: "The espionage activities of American agents in the Soviet Union are still continuing, and their momentum has not diminished." This also tells us that as long as imperialism still exists, this hidden sabotage and aggression will never stop.
　　"The Great Anti-Soviet Conspiracy" reveals the open and hidden aggressive activities of imperialist countries such as the United States, Britain, and France against the Soviet Union on a larger scale. The historical facts recorded in this book span the thirty years from 1917 to 1946, from the time when the Soviet people overthrew the old reactionary rule in 1917 and established the first socialist country on one-sixth of the world's land, until the end of the anti-fascist war. The authors used convincing facts to expose the long-term, insidious and despicable sabotage activities carried out by the imperialist group against the Soviet people.
　　On the eve of the October Revolution, the Russian people had gradually realized that they should use revolutionary armed forces to overthrow the old reactionary rule. Under the shock of the people's revolution, the imperialist group felt that the foundation of the old enslavement and rule of the Russian people had become shaky, and they wanted to suppress the revolution with sinful black hands. They tried their best to support the reactionary rule of the Kerensky Provisional Government, which had completely lost the trust and support of the people; but the so-called provisional government was just "a piece of paper on top supported by bayonets in St. Petersburg, Moscow and some other cities." When Kerensky showed that he was unable to suppress the revolution, the imperialist group even more blatantly advocated: "The only thing Russia needs today is a military dictatorship." They sought out the reactionary officers of the Tsarist era, Kolchak and Kornilov, as the military dictators of Russia, and wanted to save the old reactionary rule of Russia with bloody suppression.
　　When these conspiracies and tricks all failed and the Soviet people finally overthrew the old reactionary rule and established their own country, the imperialist group was still unwilling to admit its failure. They did not recognize the Soviet regime and wanted to isolate this nascent socialist country within the international scope, wishing in vain: "The life of the Soviet regime is only a matter of days," and the old reactionary rule will be quickly restored. At the same time, they are also increasingly stepping up open and hidden aggressive activities. They used secret loans, sent military advisers, and supplied a large amount of military supplies and materials to support the counter-revolutionary rebellious armed forces; they wanted to overthrow the young Soviet state while the Soviet regime and revolutionary order were not yet consolidated. From the secret support of the counter-revolutionary rebellious armed forces, it developed later into open and blatant armed intervention. The aggressive troops of imperialist groups such as Britain, the United States, France, Germany, and Japan and the counter-revolutionary rebellious armed forces used extremely barbaric and brutal methods to massacre large numbers of Soviet people, burn villages, loot property, and rape women. They boasted: "We shot the Bolsheviks with gas bombs." In this criminal aggression, the imperialist group owed a huge blood debt to the Soviet people. The authors of this book pointed out: "In two and a half years of armed intervention and civil war, seven million Russian men, women and children died from fighting, hunger and disease. The material loss of this country was later estimated by the Soviet government at six million US dollars. ... The aggressors did not pay any compensation."
　　Coordinated with the armed intervention of the imperialist group was a large-scale hidden sabotage activity. Even after the open armed aggression was crushed by the heroic Soviet people, the hidden sabotage activities of imperialism against the Soviet Union continued for a long time. In this criminal sabotage activity, the imperialists used all the remnants of the old era, such as the Tsar Russian Officers' League, the remnants of the Tsar Russian Secret Police, social chauvinists, Menshevik party members, Trotsky bandits... They combined with these traitors and bandits to spy on secrets, organize military rebellions, create social terror and chaos, and carry out despicable assassination acts; under the direct instruction of imperialism, the counter-revolutionary bandits assassinated Lenin, the mentor of the people's revolution all over the world, and killed Kirov, Menzhinsky, and Kubyshev, outstanding leaders of the Soviet people, and poisoned Gorky, the great writer loved by the people all over the world; economically, they tried their best to organize strikes and sabotage, and wanted to disintegrate the Soviet regime with poverty and famine. The imperialist group not only supported all counter-revolutionary forces in the Soviet Union, but also protected all counter-revolutionary elements who fled abroad, and constantly subsidized the Mensheviks and Trotsky bandits with money, instigating them to engage in the traitorous activities of betraying the Soviet people. In all reactionary-ruled cities in Europe and the Americas, "anti-Soviet conspiracies were boiling."
　　With the increasing consolidation of the Soviet revolutionary regime and the continuous improvement of the Soviet people's political awareness, the counter-revolutionary conspiracy was increasingly hit hard, the activities of the rebels were constantly suppressed, and the destructive forces of imperialism became increasingly isolated. In the Soviet government's trial of the treason of the right-wing and Trotskyist groups in 1938, the counter-revolutionary conspiracy was completely crushed, thereby guaranteeing the consolidation of the Soviet regime and the unanimous unity of the whole country in the anti-fascist patriotic war, enabling the Soviet Union to withstand the most severe test.
　　In the more than thirty years of anti-Soviet activities of imperialism (even during the anti-fascist war, the anti-Soviet activities within the imperialist camp never stopped), although it has been constantly frustrated, the activities of imperialism against the Soviet people and the revolutionary people all over the world have never stopped.
　　For the Chinese people who are engaged in opposing the aggression of American imperialism, these two books have profound educational significance. It not only reveals the true history of American imperialism and other imperialists opposing the Soviet people; more importantly, it tells us that the hidden sabotage of imperialism is an important part of its aggressive policy. If imperialism still exists for a day, this hidden aggressive activity will never stop. Therefore, when opposing the open aggression of American imperialism, we should redouble our vigilance against the various hidden sabotage and aggressive activities of American imperialism. Facts have constantly proved that after the aggressive forces of American imperialism were driven out of mainland China, it was not reconciled to failure.
　　We should always keep in mind Chairman Mao's announcement: "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will never be reconciled to their defeat, and they will still make the final struggle. After the country is pacified, they will still engage in sabotage and disruption in various ways, and they will try to restore in China every day and every hour. This is inevitable, without any doubt, and we must not relax our vigilance." (Opening speech at the first plenary session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference) We should even more strengthen the judicial and public security machinery of the people's democratic dictatorship a hundredfold, and severely suppress all destructive activities of imperialists and special agent traitors.

    推荐“美国外交家的秘密”美、布卡尔著移模译三十二开本一五四页  基价四·六○元时代出版社一九五○年六月版
    “反苏大阴谋”  美、萨伊尔斯、卡恩合著  潘际坰等合译三十二开本  三五○页  基价十二元  华夏书店一九五○年一月三版                                                            
    美帝国主义在全世界规模所进行的侵略活动中，它表现出来的形式不外乎公开露骨的武装侵略和隐蔽迂回的暗藏破坏活动两种。隐蔽迂回的暗藏破坏活动是美帝侵略政策中的重要组成部分，这种侵略活动因为戴着各种各样的伪装，常常使被侵略国家的人民一时难以认清它的真实面目，把披着袈裟的强盗当成自己的朋友，因而对它的破坏活动失掉警惕，疏于防范。
    对于平时不大注意帝国主义暗藏破坏活动的读者们，我愿意向他们推荐“美国外交家的秘密”和“反苏大阴谋”这两本书，这两本书将帮助我们去认识美帝国主义的真实面目。两本书的作者都是美国人，他们以亲身的经历或者根据许多无可争辩的事实，揭露了美帝国主义和其他的帝国主义者对人民革命事业所怀着的深仇大恨，对获得了解放的苏联人民所曾经进行过的阴险卑劣的破坏。这些满手血腥的匪徒，也曾经并且现在还想在中国人民面前装扮成悲天悯人的救世主的。
    “美国外交家的秘密”的作者布卡尔女士，是一个“土生的美国人”。她曾经在美国国务院的谍报机关里作过事，在莫斯科的美国大使馆工作了两年，目击到在莫斯科的美国大使馆在外交特权的庇护下所进行的罪恶活动。她具有美国人民所共有的善良愿望，希望全世界人民能够和平相处，希望美国与苏联维持亲睦的关系；但她从自己的亲身经历和日常工作中，认清楚了美帝国主义统治集团在对苏联人民的暗藏破坏中，把全世界引向残酷的战争：“我看到负责美国外交政策的美国外交家们，正在怎样尽他们力之所及、一步步实现那世界浩劫。他们的政策一向老是针对着苏联；他们蓄意破坏世界和平，镇压全世界各民族争取幸福、较良好生活的斗争。”作者指出了美国外交家如此仇恨苏联的原因，是因为“这些外交家现在都已认清：阻止美国亿万富翁统治全世界的，是苏联”。为着要实现华尔街大老板奴役全人类的梦想，就必然要对全世界和平民主阵营的苏联进行各种公开和暗藏的侵略活动。布卡尔女士从这些罪恶的活动中，认识到美国反动统治集团的所作所为是和美国人民的希望完全背道而驰的；经过了复杂的自我思想斗争，“抛弃一切私人的和感情的顾虑”，她觉悟到不应再去执行战贩们的命令，以致“对全世界人民负起一部分罪恶的责任”。她勇敢的用行动抗议美国战贩们的活动，在一九四八年辞掉了美国大使馆的职务，决定长期留在苏联。她向全世界爱和平的人民宣告：“采取这样的步骤，使我有机会有效地参加反战争贩子们的斗争。”“在这里，我能够殚精竭力地参加争取和平和世界繁荣的斗争。”
    本书的作者虽然因为个人经历的限制，对美帝国主义者在苏联所进行的暗藏破坏活动的揭露还不是全面与广泛的，但正因为她所揭发的，都是她的“亲身经历”，本书就具有非常朴质和真切的感人力量。它告诉我们，美帝国主义者怎样在外交人员、新闻记者、红十字会工作人员的伪装掩护下，进行他们的阴谋活动。当反法西斯战争还在进行时期，美国的谍报机关战略事务局，已经在美国独占资本家的领导下，变成反动的巢穴，“专门训练谍报人员和组织其他的破坏工作，以从事反苏的活动。”在美国国务院里，独占资本家支持少数极端敌视苏联的阴谋分子，这一小撮反苏分子所组成的“美苏关系的垄断者”的小集团，“完全控制着国务院和莫斯科美国大使馆的用人之权”，在这一集团的操纵下，“对于几乎一切主要的事件，除了极少时期例外，他们始终能够强制实行他们的反苏路线”。
    为了推进帝国主义的政策，这些反动分子希望以一只手掩盖天下人耳目，要想在美国人民和全世界人民的中间蒙蔽苏联的真象，散布敌视苏联的毒雾。他们以颠倒是非、混淆黑白的办法，制造着各式各样的谣言，传布诬蔑、中伤苏联的虚伪报道。“他们相信只要充分地反复对苏联做着各式各样的恶意中伤的宣传，最后一定会为一般美国人当做真理接受。”作者曾确当地指出，反动分子要在美国人民中掩盖苏联真象的原因，是因为“那掌握着一切政治经济权力的六十个家族，深深地害怕苏联这个榜样会是有“传染性”的。如果美国人民发现在社会主义和共产主义社会里，人民比在资本主义之下生活得更好、享受着更大的自由，也许他们会企图接管美国的一切生产工具和权力”。美帝国主义的统治集团，就渴望着从欺骗与蒙蔽中，把美国人民带向为独占资本寻求超额利润的战争冒险中去。
    本书揭露了美帝国主义的特务间谍，以各种不同的形式来进行暗藏破坏的情形。他们在与那些少数头脑简单、缺乏警惕的人谈话中，巧妙地探究军队的驻地，军队的生活标准和情况，以及其他一切有谍报价值的事情；谈话者在不知不觉中变成为这些特务间谍的消息报告者。这些特务间谍“总注意着不小心的头脑简单的人，巧妙地把他拖进泥淖”。另一部分特务间谍则伪装着对苏联友好的姿态，以取得接近他们的人的信任，然后从日常交往中来取得秘密情报。这种揭露诚然还比较浅近，但胜利了的中国人民是应该从这里得到充分的警惕的。
    在苏联国家和人民的高度警惕下，美帝国主义的对苏联的暗藏破坏曾不断地遭到揭露和应有的打击，但正如本书作者所指出的：“美国特务人员在苏联境内的间谍活动现仍在继续，其势并未稍杀。”这也告诉我们，帝国主义如果还存在的一天，这种隐藏破坏的侵略活动是绝不会停止的。
    “反苏大阴谋”是在更大的规模上，揭露美、英、法等帝国主义国家对苏联的公开和暗藏的侵略活动。本书所记录的史实，纵贯了一九一七年至一九四六年的三十个年头，从一九一七年苏联人民推翻了旧的反动统治，在全世界六分之一的土地上建立起第一个社会主义国家的时候起，一直到反法西斯战争结束。作者用令人信服的事实，揭露了帝国主义集团对苏联人民长时期进行的、阴险卑劣的破坏活动。
    十月革命的前夕，俄国人民已逐渐地认识到要用革命的武装来推翻旧的反动统治。帝国主义集团在人民革命的震撼下，感到旧的奴役和统治俄国人民的基础已经动摇不稳，它们想以罪恶的黑手压制革命。它们竭力扶持已经完全丧失了人民的信任与支持的克伦斯基临时政府的反动统治；但所谓临时政府，不过是“一种在彼得堡、莫斯科和若干别的城市借刺刀支持的签押公文的上层玩意”。当克伦斯基表现出无力来镇压革命时，帝国主义集团更明目张胆地主张着：“今天俄国的唯一事情是军事独裁。”它们物色了沙皇时的反动军官高尔察克和科尔尼洛夫为俄国的军事独裁者，想以血腥的镇压来挽救俄国旧的反动统治。
    当这些阴谋诡计都失败了，苏联人民终于推翻了旧的反动统治，建立起自己的国家时，帝国主义集团仍决不甘心于承认自己的失败。它们不承认苏维埃政权，想在国际范围内孤立这个初生的社会主义国家，一相情愿的想望着：“苏维埃政权的寿命不过是几天间的事”，旧的反动统治将会迅速复辟。同时也日益加紧地进行着公开和暗藏的侵略活动。它们以秘密的借款，派遣军事顾问，大量供应军火、物资，来支持反革命的叛乱武装；想趁苏维埃政权和革命秩序还不巩固的时候来推翻年青的苏维埃国家。从对反革命叛乱武装的秘密支持，更发展到后来公开露骨的武装干涉。英、美、法、德、日等帝国主义集团的侵略军队与反革命的叛乱武装，用极端野蛮残暴的方法大批屠杀苏联人民，焚烧村庄，抢劫财物，奸淫妇女，他们夸耀着：“我们用毒气弹射击布尔什维克。”在这次罪恶的侵略中，帝国主义集团对苏联人民欠下了巨大的血债，本书的作者指出：“在两年半的武装干涉和内战中，使俄国的男人、女人和小孩由于战斗、饥饿和疾病而死亡的达七百万人。这个国家的物质损失，后来经苏维埃政府估计为六百万万美元。……侵略者们却没有付还任何补偿。”
    与帝国主义集团的武装干涉相配合的，是广大规模的暗藏破坏活动，就在公开的武装侵略被英勇的苏联人民粉碎后，帝国主义对苏联的暗藏破坏活动仍然长期继续着。在这种罪恶的破坏活动中，帝国主义者利用了一切旧时代的残渣，如沙俄军官同盟、沙俄秘密警察残部、社会沙文主义者、孟塞维克党徒、托洛斯基匪帮……它们结合着这些叛徒、匪棍进行刺探秘密，组织军事叛乱，制造社会的恐怖混乱，进行着卑劣的暗杀行为；在帝国主义的直接指使下，反革命的匪叛们刺杀过全世界人民革命的导师列宁，杀害了基洛夫、曼辛斯基、古比雪夫等苏联人民卓越的领导者，毒死了全世界人民敬爱的伟大作家高尔基；经济上则尽量的组织着怠工、破坏，想用贫困、饥馑来瓦解苏维埃政权。帝国主义集团不仅在苏联国内扶持着一切反革命力量，而且庇护着一切逃亡在国外的反革命分子，不断以金钱去津贴孟塞维克、托洛斯基匪帮，嗾使他们进行叛卖苏联人民的勾当。在欧洲、美洲一切反动统治的城市里，“都沸腾着反苏的阴谋”。
    随着苏联革命政权的日趋巩固，苏联人民政治觉悟的不断提高，反革命的阴谋才遭到日益加重的打击，叛逆们的活动不断遭到镇压，帝国主义的破坏力量才越加变得孤立。在一九三八年苏联政府对右翼和托派集团叛国的审讯中，彻底粉碎了反革命的阴谋，从而保证了在反法西斯卫国战争中苏维埃政权的巩固和举国一致的团结力量，使苏联能够承受最严峻的考验。
    帝国主义在三十多年的反苏活动中（即使在反法西斯战争期间，帝国主义阵营内部也从未中止过反苏活动），虽然不断遭到挫败，但帝国主义反对苏联人民和全世界革命人民的活动是从没有停止的。
    对于正在从事反对美帝国主义侵略的中国人民，这两本书具有着深刻的教育意义，它不单单揭露了美帝国主义和其他帝国主义反对苏联人民的真实历史；更重要的是告诉我们帝国主义的暗藏破坏是它侵略政策中的重要部分，帝国主义如果还存在一天，这种隐蔽的侵略活动就绝不会停止。因此在反对美帝国主义的公开侵略时，应加倍提高对美帝国主义各种暗藏破坏的侵略活动的警惕。事实已经不断证明，美帝国主义的侵略势力被赶出中国大陆后，它是不甘心于失败的。
    我们应该时时刻刻的牢记着毛主席的昭示：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。在全国平定以后，他们也还会以各种方式从事破坏和捣乱，他们将每日每时企图在中国复辟。这是必然的，毫无疑义的，我们务必不要松懈自己的警惕性。”（在中国人民政协第一届全体会议的开幕词）我们更应该百倍地加强人民民主专政的司法和公安的机器，严厉地镇压帝国主义者和特务奸细匪徒们的一切破坏活动。
