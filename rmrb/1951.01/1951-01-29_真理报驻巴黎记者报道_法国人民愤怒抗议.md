　　French People Angrily Protest

　　[Xinhua News Agency, 28th] According to TASS Moscow: *Pravda* correspondent in Paris, Zhukov, reports: French Minister of the Interior Queuille's order prohibiting the activities of the three largest international democratic organizations in France has aroused indignation and strong opposition from the progressive people of France. Within hours of the announcement of Queuille's order, workers in several Parisian enterprises went on strike to protest. Countless delegations immediately went to see the Prime Minister and the Minister of the Interior to protest this fascist decision. Many democratic organizations in France—the French General Confederation of Labor, the French Women's Union, the French Republican Youth League, and many other groups—advocate refusing to accept this illegal decision. The French Communist Party, which stands at the forefront of the struggle for peace and national independence, has called on peace-loving people to unite and protest this fascist order.

　　Zhukov commented: It is ridiculous that the reactionary French newspapers are trying to portray these orders as a "dissolution" of the three major organizations. This task is not only beyond the power of Queuille with his police, but also beyond the power of Truman with his atomic bombers. Only the people themselves can decide the fate of these organizations, which have a global scope. Zhukov continued: Queuille's order was issued the day after Eisenhower left Paris. The international democratic organizations have annoyed the "MacArthur of Europe" so much because these organizations fulfill the will of their millions of members, defend peace with action, and oppose the restoration of the Hitler army in West Germany under Eisenhower's supervision. The source of the order prohibiting the activities of international democratic organizations in France is obvious. Just a few days ago, the American magazine *Life* published a thirteen-page article criticizing the French government for not being forceful enough in suppressing democratic organizations. The next day, the French President issued a statement stating that resolute action would be taken. Hours later, Queuille's order was published, winning praise from the leaders of the Congress of Industrial Organizations in the United States. However, such measures will only lead to a closer unity of anti-fascist democratic forces.

    法国人民愤怒抗议
    【新华社二十八日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报驻巴黎记者朱可夫报道：法国内政部长葛义禁止三个最大国际民主团体在法国活动的命令已引起了法国进步人民的愤慨与强烈反对。在葛义的命令宣布后数小时，巴黎的若干企业的工人就举行罢工以示抗议。无数的代表团立即去见总理和内政部长，抗议这种法西斯的决定。法国的许多民主团体——法国总工会、法兰西妇女联盟、法兰西共和青年联盟及许多其他团体均主张拒绝接受这种非法决定。站在争取和平与国家独立的斗争的最前列的法国共产党已号召希望和平的人们团结起来抗议这个法西斯命令。
    朱可夫评称：法国反动报纸企图把这些命令说成是“解散”三大团体，这是很可笑的。这个任务不但超乎有警察的葛义的权力之外，而且也超乎有原子轰炸机的杜鲁门的权力之外。这些具有世界规模的团体，只有人民自己才能决定它们的命运。朱可夫继称：葛义的命令是在艾森豪威尔离开巴黎的第二天发出的。国际民主团体使“欧洲的麦克阿瑟”这样恼怒，就是因为这些团体履行它们千百万会员的意志，以行动保卫和平，反对在艾森豪威尔的监督下恢复西德境内的希特勒陆军。禁止国际民主团体在法国活动的命令的来源是很明显的。仅在数天之前，美国的《生活》周刊用十三页的篇幅刊载了一篇文章，斥责法国政府在镇压民主团体方面做得不够有力。第二天法国总统就发表了一篇声明，说明将采取坚决的行动。数小时之后，葛义的命令发表了，博得了美国产业工会联合会领袖们的好评。但是，这种措施只会引起反法西斯民主力量更紧密的团结。
