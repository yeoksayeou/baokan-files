Xinhua News Agency, London, January 2nd: TASS London, January 1st: Thousands of peace-loving Londoners participated in a grand demonstration organized by the Communist Party of Great Britain at Trafalgar Square on December 31st to protest the American warmongers' reconstruction of the German army commanded by Nazi officers.
　　
　　The secretary of the London District Committee of the Communist Party of Great Britain, Mahon, first spoke at the meeting, pointing out that the decision to rebuild the Nazi army and air force was a huge threat to peace. He shouted: "Americans go home, get out of Korea, Taiwan and Britain." He said: "If you (Americans) continue to provoke the people, you will surely be driven out." Mahon demanded that the slogan "No Nazis Allowed to Invade Again" be put forward in every factory, every street, and every workshop.
　　
　　Then, Campbell, the editor of the Workers' Daily, read out the speech of Pollitt, the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Great Britain. Pollitt emphasized that war can be stopped. The plans of the warmongers can be defeated. "What the British people need is confidence in their own strength and the strength of the world peace movement."
　　
　　Pollitt pointed out that the imperialists' plan was to conquer the colonial peoples of Malaya and Vietnam, and to launch the Korean War as a springboard for attacking China, but "these plans have all failed miserably."
　　
　　Pollitt's speech pointed out that the establishment of the West German army is the key to the American strategy, because the warmongers can no longer rely on the people in other European countries who have millions of people supporting the Communist Party and the peace movement. Pollitt called for the establishment of a broad peace movement in Britain, demanding a peaceful policy and demanding a treaty with a unified, independent, and demilitarized Germany. Pollitt's speech ended with the cry: "Long live the peace between the people of Britain and the Soviet Union! If they stand together, there can be no war."
　　
　　The next speaker was Kay, the propaganda secretary of the London District Committee of the Communist Party of Great Britain. When he exposed the British government's proposal to call up reservists to join the army in 1951, a roar of anger rang out from the audience.
　　
　　The meeting finally passed a resolution stating: "This great rally expresses deep disgust and anger at the British government's decision to comply with the United States' demands to rearm West Germany, headed by former Nazi officers. This traitorous act by the British government can and must be stopped by the united action of the labor movement and all British patriots." The resolution finally demanded: "Abolish the Brussels decision. Do not rearm West Germany. Establish a unified and demilitarized Germany, conclude a treaty, and immediately withdraw the occupying forces. Fulfill the Anglo-Soviet alliance treaty. Withdraw from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the American war policy."

　　伦敦人民举行盛大示威
    【新华社二日讯】塔斯社伦敦一日讯：数千爱好和平的伦敦人民于十二月三十一日在特拉法加广场参加了英国共产党所组织的盛大示威，抗议美国战争贩子重建由纳粹军官指挥的德国军队。
    英国共产党伦敦区委书记马洪首先在大会上发言，指出重建纳粹陆空军的决定是对和平的巨大威胁。他高呼：“美国人回家去，滚出朝鲜、台湾和英国。”他说：“如果你们（美国人）继续向人民挑衅，你们一定会被赶出去的。”马洪要求在每一个工厂中，每一条街上，每一个工作间中提出“不许纳粹再进军”的口号。
    继由工人日报编者甘贝尔宣读英国共产党总书记波立特的演词。波立特强调指出：战争是可以制止的。战争贩子们的计划是可以击败的。“英国人民所需要的是对他们自己的力量与世界和平运动的力量的信心”。
    波立特指出，帝国主义者的计划是要征服马来亚和越南的殖民地人民，发动朝鲜战争而形成进攻中国的跳板，然而“这些计划都悲惨地失败了”。
    波立特的演说指出，建立西德军队是美国战略的关键所在，因为战争贩子们已经不能倚靠有千百万人民拥护共产党与和平运动的其他欧洲国家中的人民了。波立特号召在英国建立广泛的和平运动，要求和平政策并要求与统一、独立和非军事化的德国缔订和约。波立特的演说最后高呼：“英苏两国人民的和平万岁！如果他们站在一起就不可能有战争。”
    接着发言的是英国共产党伦敦区委员会宣传书记凯伊。当他揭发英国政府建议在一九五一年中召集后备役人员参加军队时，听众中响起一片愤怒的吼声。
    会议最后通过决议称：“这次伟大的集会，对于英国政府决定顺从美国的要求，重行以从前的纳粹军官为首武装西德，表示了深刻的厌恶和愤怒。英国政府这种卖国行为，是能够而且也必须由劳工运动和全体英国爱国者的联合行动加以制止的。”决议最后要求：“废除布鲁塞尔决定。不要重行武装西德。建立统一和非军事化的德国，缔订和约，并随即撤退占领军。履行英苏同盟条约。退出北大西洋公约和美国的战争政策。”
