    Strive for Meritorious Service to Meet Chairman Mao
    To the Editor:
    After the National Congress of Combat Heroes Representatives ended, I returned to the Anshun Sub-district of Guizhou Province and went to various places to convey the proceedings of the meeting. I was warmly welcomed everywhere I went. Comrades in the army and the masses were all determined to strive for meritorious service to meet Chairman Mao. Here I will briefly tell you about the situation.
    On November 30th, after I finished conveying the message at a certain platoon of a certain battalion of a certain regiment, Deputy Company Commander Zeng Zhaoyou said to me: "Comrade Zhai! Your conveyance this time is stronger than our several political lessons."
    The next day, while I was in a certain platoon of a certain battalion, Comrade Long Jiguang ran in and said to the deputy company commander: "Comrade Zhai's conveyance report has educated me. I will work hard in the future." It turned out that he was a new soldier who had only joined the army in May of this year. He was not active in his work and only wanted to finish suppressing the bandits, divide the land, and go home. But he is different now. He said to people, "Look! To render meritorious service for the people, be welcomed by the people of the whole country, and also meet Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, how glorious! I am also from a poor background. I must also render meritorious service and meet Chairman Mao."
    When I went to Zhenning, it was extremely lively. The streets were crowded with people, and everyone was asking each other, "Which one has met Chairman Mao?" Four old men walked over with smiles and asked, "Who is the meritorious person?" The political commissar of a certain regiment pointed at me and said, "This is the one, this is the one who has met Chairman Mao!" The old men shook my hand with smiles and asked warmly, "When you saw Chairman Mao, did he know about the lives of us southwestern people?" I said, "He knows everything, he cares about us!" They all nodded happily. Seeing the medal hanging on my chest, they all scrambled to see it and asked, "Which one was given by Chairman Mao?"
    When I spoke about the exemplary deeds of many combat heroes, some old men and children, afraid of not hearing clearly, slowly crowded onto the stage and surrounded me. When I said that Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu were both in good health, a burst of applause rang out from under the stage. Once, when I was walking around outside, two old women pulled me to their house to chat. They asked me, "Comrade! How did the old woman you talked about yesterday (Mother of Soldiers Rong Guanxiu) perform her meritorious service?" I said, "She sent rice and flour to support the front lines, and fed the wounded and sick soup and food, taking care of them like her own sons. Her merits are many!" They immediately asked, "Is she in the Women's Federation?" I said, "Yes." They asked this and that happily and expressed that they must learn from her.

    争取立功见毛主席编辑同志：
    开罢全国战斗英雄代表会议，回到贵州省安顺分区后，我就分别到各地去传达这次会议经过。在各地我都受到热烈的欢迎。部队同志和群众都决心争取立功见毛主席。这里我把经过情形简单地告诉你。
    十一月三十日，我在某团某营某排作完传达后，曾兆友副连长对我说：“翟同志！你这次的传达比我们上几堂政治课还强。”
    第二天，我正在某营某排，战士龙继光同志跑进来对副连长说：“翟同志的传达报告教育了我，我今后要好好工作。”原来他是今年五月才参军的新战士，工作不积极，只想把土匪剿完，分了田，就回家去。可是他现在不同了，他对人说：“你看！为人民立了功，受到全国人民的欢迎，还见到毛主席和朱总司令，多光荣啊！我也是个穷人出身，我一定也要立功，见毛主席。”
    我到镇宁去时，可热闹极了。街道上挤满了人，大家都互相问，“那个是见过毛主席的？”有四个老头，笑哈哈地走过来问：“谁是功臣呀？”某团的政委指着我说：“这个就是，就是他见过毛主席！”老头儿笑嘻嘻地握着我的手，亲热地问：“你见了毛主席，他老人家可知道俺西南人民的生活情形哪？”我说：“他都知道，他可关心咱们啦！”他们都高兴地点点头。看见我胸前挂的奖章，他们都争着看，又问：“那个是毛主席给的呀？”
    当我说到许多战斗英雄的模范事迹时，一些老头和小孩子怕听不真，慢慢地都挤到台上来把我围住了。当我说到毛主席和朱总司令身体都很健康时，台底下哗地一声鼓起掌来。有一次我在外面闲走，两个老太婆把我拉到她家去拉呱。她们问我：“同志呀！你昨儿说的那个老太婆（子弟兵母亲戎冠秀）是怎样立的功呀？”我说：“她送米送面支援前线，给伤病员喂汤喂饭，照顾得像自己儿子一样。她的功劳可多哩！”她们紧接着问：“她是不是在妇女会”？我说：“是的。”她们高兴地问这问那。并表示一定要向她学习。
