To the Editor:

　　The Northwest Hebei Sandy Waste Afforestation Bureau recently dispatched cadres to conduct focused forestry protection inspection and publicity work in areas such as Xingtang, Xinle, Wuji, Zhengding, and Gaocheng counties. The inspection of twelve key villages in these five counties revealed that the damage to the Northwest Hebei Sandy Waste Area forests is quite serious. During the inspection, twenty-eight cases of forest damage were discovered. Among them, six cases were relatively serious and have been sent to the local People's Court for handling.

　　These cases of forest damage generally fall into the following categories:

　　(1) Backward elements in rural areas are engaged in theft. Jia Fulai, a demobilized soldier from Gugun Village in Xingtang, and Jia Ergen, a deserter, colluded in early January this year to steal and cut down eleven large trees and dozens of small trees. They were discovered by the local public security officer when they borrowed a cart to haul the trees. Han Xiaoyin from Xidu Village in Zhengding County also stole and cut down trees. He fled after being discovered and has not dared to return home.

　　(2) Individual landlords in some areas are deliberately destructive. Ma Luoling, a landlord from Xiwulou Village in Xinle County, secretly cut down more than three hundred public trees in the village in December last year. Zheng Luochang, a landlord from Dongli Village, also secretly cut down small trees for firewood.

　　(3) In all areas, a small number of children are cutting down small trees. According to a survey in Beigaoli Village in Xingtang, children cut down small trees every day.

　　The lack of fuel in the local area is an objective reason for the damage to the trees; however, the main reason is that the local forestry and government agencies responsible for forestry protection have not done a good enough job. Some counties and districts have made excellent arrangements for forestry protection work, but lack sufficient inspection, and the forestry protection covenants have become mere formalities. Some counties and districts only emphasize forestry protection during the afforestation season, but rarely pay attention to it at other times. Some counties and districts have failed to promptly handle cases of forest damage and educate the masses, which has also contributed to the trend of forest destruction.

### 冀西沙荒林受到破坏  有关机关应加强护林工作

　　冀西沙荒林受到破坏
    有关机关应加强护林工作编辑同志：
    冀西沙荒造林局最近曾派出干部到行唐、新乐、无极、正定及藁县等地区有重点地进行护林检查与宣传工作。从这五个县份的十二个重点村检查的结果看来，冀西沙荒林受破坏的情况是相当严重的。检查中已发现破坏林木案件二十八起。其中并有六起情节较为严重者，现已送当地人民法院处理。
    这些破坏林木的案件，大概有以下几类。
    （一）农村中的落后分子进行偷窃。行唐故郡村复员军人贾福来、逃亡战士贾二根，今年一月初曾结伙偷砍大树十一棵，小树数十棵。当他们借用大车拉树时，才被当地公安员发现。正定县西杜村韩小银也曾偷砍树木，被发觉后逃跑了，到现在还不敢回家。
    （二）个别地区地主故意破坏。新乐县西五楼村，地主马洛岭于去年十二月间，曾偷砍村中公有的树木三百多株。东里村地主郑洛常也曾偷砍小树作烧柴。
    （三）各地均有少数儿童砍伐小树。据行唐北高里村调查，每天都有儿童砍伐小树。
    当地燃料缺乏，是树木受到破坏的客观原因；但主要的还是由于当地的林业及政府各负责机关，对护林工作做得不够好的缘故。有些县区对于护林工作，布置很好，但检查不够，护林公约流于形式。有的县区只在造林季节强调护林，平时却很少闻问。有的县区，对于破坏林木的案件，未能及时处理与教育群众，这样也助长了破坏林木的风气。
