　　The Work of the Northeast Youth League in the Past Year
　　Northeast Youth League Committee Office
　　In 1950, under the correct leadership and assistance of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League and the Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the work of the Northeast New Democratic Youth League achieved great development and success. The number of Youth League members increased from over 240,000 to over 600,000; Youth League organizations have been established in most industrial and mining enterprises, all government agencies, schools, and the vast rural areas. Furthermore, the first Northeast Youth League Congress was held last September, and the leading organ of the Youth League – the Northeast Working Committee of the New Democratic Youth League – was formally established. The role of the Youth League has become increasingly significant with its rapid development.

　　In economic construction, under the leadership of the Party, the Youth League has gradually implemented the policy of serving economic construction. Youth League members in industrial and mining enterprises have fully played their roles in the New Record Movement, in establishing production responsibility systems, promoting the eight-grade wage system, rationalization proposals, promoting the advanced experience of the Ma Hengchang Group, conservation efforts, and other work, as well as in the patriotic labor emulation campaigns, becoming initiators, propagandists, and promoters of various tasks. Youth League members in rural areas have also played their due roles in promoting new farm tools, improved varieties, new cultivation methods, participating in supply and marketing cooperatives, carrying out literacy campaigns, participating in militia self-defense forces to protect rural revolutionary order, and in disaster area production self-rescue and dike repairs. Young people account for 70 to 80 percent of the hundreds of thousands of militia self-defense forces in the Northeast. Many Youth League members have become the backbone of production mutual aid groups and labor models. Among the 90 representatives from the Northeast region who attended the National Congress of Labor Models of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers, 23 were young people.

　　Youth League members in schools have implemented the policy of carrying out New Democracy study, assisting school administration and student unions in helping the majority of students to learn their regular courses well, improving study methods, and generally improving the academic performance of Youth League members and students, initially establishing a learning attitude and perspective of serving the people. Youth League members in government agencies have played an active role in ensuring the completion of work tasks, studying professional skills, implementing work-study systems, and enlivening the life of the agency.

　　Especially in the movement to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea to Defend Our Homes and Country, the Youth League has become the core force for the vast number of young people to participate in various national defense construction movements. Youth League members have used their exemplary behavior to encourage young peasants to join the army and participate in the war. In Changling County, Jilin Province alone, 3,861 young people signed up to join the Korean Volunteer Army, expressing that "in order to defend our happy life, we will not return home until we drive out the American devils." Young women also requested to go to Korea to do medical work; sometimes they persuaded their loved ones to join the army. Young workers and students wrote letters of determination and oaths, vying for approval from superiors to go to Korea to resist U.S. aggression. More than 4,300 young people from Fushun mines signed their names on letters of determination. More than 300 faculty members and students from Harbin Medical University formed the Bethune Youth Medical Team and volunteered to participate in the Korean War of Liberation. Blood donation teams, rescue teams, and others were organized in many places. At the same time, enthusiastic movements to comfort the troops and visit wounded and sick soldiers were launched in various places. According to incomplete statistics, 20,000 college and middle school students and thousands of young workers in the Northeast have participated in military school studies, national defense construction, and other revolutionary work. Many young people are determined to accept severe tests and strive to join the Youth League and the Party in the struggle.

　　In order to win greater victory in the struggle to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea to Defend Our Homes and Country and to enhance the strength of the motherland, young workers in Northeast industrial and mining enterprises are currently participating in labor emulation with high patriotic enthusiasm. They have put forward the slogans "The factory is the battlefield, the machine is the weapon" and "Defeat the enemy with production." The Liu Lifu production team of the Lushun Shipyard Youth League members had an average monthly output of 243 percent from January to October, and the quality has always been 100 percent. The group has been approved for quality inspection exemption and has won the honorary title of "Excellent Product Quality Group." The young people and Youth League members of the Andong Railway, standing at the forefront of national defense, persisted in their work under enemy bombing and strafing, bravely repairing damaged lines and rescuing refugees. Students studying in schools, in addition to further deepening their study of political current events, are now turning their patriotic enthusiasm into practical action, studying their lessons more diligently, and exercising their bodies. Their slogan is: "Study to serve the motherland," "Learn your skills well, and listen to the call of the motherland anytime, anywhere." Young people in rural areas are now actively participating in winter study, engaging in sideline occupations, preparing for major production next year, and participating in various tasks of the struggle to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea to Defend Our Homes and Country.

　　In the past year, under the unified leadership of the Party, Youth League committees at all levels in the Northeast have used various methods to conduct education on patriotism, internationalism, and collectivism among Youth League members and young people. This education has been carried out in conjunction with various movements. For example, in the movement against U.S. imperialist aggression in Taiwan and Korea, in celebrating the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, the peace signature movement, welcoming the visit of the Soviet Youth Delegation and the World Federation of Democratic Youth Delegation to China, and various holiday commemorative activities, especially since the movement to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, it has been carried out particularly widely and deeply. For example, in Lüda City, as of the beginning of November, 1,061 current affairs reports of various sizes had been held, with 200,379 young people from all walks of life attending. This powerfully promoted the various tasks of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea to defend our homes and country.

　　Secondly, the Northeast Youth League Committee and Youth League committees at all levels edited and published Youth League periodicals and various teaching materials, such as the Northeast Youth League Committee's organ, "Life Knowledge," with a maximum circulation of 75,500 copies per issue. "Good Children" had a maximum of 80,000 copies per issue. Youth League newspapers numbering 18 types were published by provincial and municipal Youth League committees with a circulation of tens of thousands of copies. In addition, many places also compiled and printed some Youth League teaching materials and pamphlets on current affairs political education. These publications have played a certain role in guiding the work of the Youth League and educating Youth League members and the vast number of young people.

　　Currently, in some large cities in the Northeast, such as Shenyang, Lüda, Harbin, and Fushun, a system of propagandists has begun to be established; in the provinces, propaganda stations have also been established in rural areas, focusing on teaching current affairs, policies, and basic knowledge of the Youth League to Youth League members and young people by propagandists, and conducting ideological and organizational education of the Youth League.

　　In addition, in cadre education, in addition to the Northeast Youth League School, which has held three sessions, training a total of 570 students, a total of 226 sessions of provincial, municipal, and county Youth League schools, Youth League training classes, spare-time rotational training, and vacation training classes have been held, training 2,266 Youth League district committee-level cadres, 17,562 Youth League branch committee members (and individual group leaders), and 599 Youth League members. In these Youth League schools, the main focus is on conducting education on policies, theories, and Youth League affairs, and improving the political level and working ability of Youth League cadres.

　　However, there are still some weaknesses in the work of the Northeast Youth League: first, there is a lack of systematic understanding of the ideological trends and characteristics of young people, and a lack of systematic and planned education of Youth League members and young people in connection with reality; the Youth League's leadership does not fully recognize the Youth League as a school for educating young people with Marxism-Leninism, and lacks the adoption of persuasive education methods to carry out the work of the Youth League, educating the vast number of young people to consciously complete the central tasks of the Party and government. Secondly, the connection between the Youth League and the masses is generally good, but the Youth League's leadership still has shortcomings such as formalism and detachment from the masses. There are coercive orders and bureaucratic styles within the Youth League. Many tasks have not been done well by uniting the masses, and the organizational role of the Youth League has not been fully exerted.

　　Since the Fourth Northeast Provincial and Municipal Youth League Committee Secretaries' Conference put forward the call of "Deepen leadership, improve work style, face the branches, and face the masses," Youth League cadres at all levels have actively participated in the Party's rectification movement. In particular, after the first Northeast Youth League Congress put forward the call to "Strengthen education and closely connect with the masses," the above-mentioned shortcomings have been somewhat corrected. Since the movement to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea to Defend Our Homes and Country, there has been significant progress in the work of various places. However, these problems have not been completely resolved. For example, in various tasks to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, some places put forward left-leaning slogans, made excessive demands on the masses, and Youth League members and activists were overly prominent, resulting in formalism. In publicity and education, it is generalized, lacks system and planning, and has not yet implemented publicity and education work into all tasks.

　　Therefore, the work of the Northeast Youth League still needs to continue to vigorously implement the spirit of the first Northeast Youth League Congress in the future, further improve the leadership of the Youth League, cultivate and train cadres, unite and educate the vast number of young people, and strive to complete the tasks of the country's economic construction and national defense construction.

　　一年来东北青年团的工作
    东北青年团委办公室
    一九五○年，东北新民主主义青年团的工作，在团中央和中共中央东北局的正确领导与帮助下，获得了很大的发展与成绩。团员从二十四万余名发展到六十万余名；团的组织已在大部工矿、企业、所有机关、学校及广大农村中建立起来了。并在去年九月召开了东北首届团代大会；正式成立了团的领导机关——新民主主义青年团东北工作委员会。团的作用随着团的迅速发展而日益显著。
    在经济建设事业中，团在党的领导下，逐步贯彻了为经济建设服务的方针。工矿、企业中的青年团员，能够在新纪录运动中，在建立生产责任制、推行八级工资制、合理化建议、推广马恒昌先进小组经验、节约等工作中，在爱国主义劳动竞赛运动中，都充分地发挥了自己的作用，成为各项工作中的倡议者、宣传者与推动者。农村中的团员在推广新农具、优良品种、新的耕作法、参加供销合作社、开展识字运动、参加民兵自卫队保卫农村革命秩序，以及灾区的生产自救、修堤等工作中，也都发挥了应有的作用。东北数十万民兵自卫队，青年就占百分之七十到八十。许多团员成为生产互助组的骨干，劳动模范。东北区出席全国工农兵劳模代表会议九十名代表中，就有二十三名是青年。
    学校中团员，贯彻执行了开展新民主主义学习的方针，协同学校行政与学生会帮助广大同学学好正课，改进了学习方法，使团员和同学的成绩普遍提高，初步树立了为人民服务的学习态度与观点。在机关中的团员，在保证工作任务的完成，钻研业务，执行工作学习制度，和活跃机关生活上，都起了积极作用。
    特别是在抗美援朝保家卫国运动中，团成为广大青年参加各项国防建设运动的核心力量，团员以自己模范行为带动了广大青年农民参军、参战。仅吉林省长岭县就有三千八百六十一名青年报名参加援朝志愿军，他们表示：为了保卫幸福的好日子，不打退美国鬼子不回家。青年妇女也要求赴朝作救护工作；有时则劝自己的爱人参军。青年工人与青年学生纷纷写决心书、宣誓词，争相要求上级批准他们赴朝抗美。抚顺工矿青年在决心书上签名的达四千三百余名。哈尔滨医科大学三百余名教职学员组成白求恩青年医疗队，志愿参加朝鲜解放战争。在许多地方组织了输血队、救护队等。与此同时各地并展开了热烈的劳军与慰问伤病员运动。据不完全统计全东北已有二万名大、中学生、数千名青年工人参加了军事学校学习、国防建设及其他革命工作。许多青年决心接受严重的考验，在斗争中争取入团、入党。
    为了争取抗美援朝保家卫国斗争的更大胜利，增强祖国的实力，目前全东北工矿青年，正以高度的爱国主义热情，参加了劳动竞赛。提出“工厂就是战场，机器就是武器”，“用生产战胜敌人”的行动口号。旅顺船厂团员刘立富生产小组，从一月到十月每月平均产量百分之二百四十三，质量一直是百分之百。该小组已被批准质量免检，荣获“优等产品质量小组”的光荣称号。屹立在国防前线的安东铁路青年与团员，在敌机轰炸扫射下坚持工作，奋勇抢修被破坏的线路及救护难民。在学校里学习的同学，除了更进一步地深入学习政治时事外，现正将爱国热情变为实际行动，更加紧张地学习功课，锻炼身体。他们的口号是：“学习为祖国服务”，“学好本领，随时随地听从祖国的呼唤”。农村中的青年，现正积极参加冬学，搞副业，准备明年大生产，和参加抗美援朝保家卫国斗争的各项工作。
    一年来，东北各地团委在党的统一领导下，采用各种方法，在团员和青年中进行了爱国主义、国际主义与集体主义的教育。这种教育是结合着各种运动进行的。如在反对美帝侵略台湾、朝鲜的运动中，在庆祝中苏友好同盟条约的签订、和平签名运动、欢迎苏联青年代表团与世界民主青年联盟代表团访问中国、各种节日纪念活动中，尤其是抗美援朝运动以来，开展得尤为广泛深入。如旅大市截至十一月上旬，即举行各种大小时事报告一千零六十一次，各界青年听众达二十万零三百七十九名。有力地推动了抗美援朝保家卫国各项工作。
    其次东北团委与各级团委编辑与出版了团刊与各种教材，如东北团委机关报《生活知识》，每期发行数最高达七万五千五百份。《好孩子》每期最高达八万份。各省市团委共出版了十八种团报，发行十数万份。另外许多地方还编印了一些团的教材与时事政治教育的小册子。这些刊物对指导团的工作和教育团员与广大青年都起了一定的作用。
    现在在东北一些大的城市如沈阳、旅大、哈尔滨、抚顺等地，已开始建立宣传员制度；各省在农村中，也有重点的成立宣传员传授站。由宣传员在团员和青年中讲授时事、政策、团的基本知识，进行团的思想教育与组织教育。
    另外，在干部教育上，除东北团校办了三期，共训练学员五百七十名外，总计各省、市、县团校、团训班、业余轮训和假期训练班共办过二百二十六期，训练了团区委级干部二千二百六十六名，团支委（和个别的小组长）一万七千五百六十二名，团员五百九十九名。在这些团校中，主要是进行政策、理论和团的业务教育，提高团的干部政治水平与工作能力。
    但是东北青年团的工作还存在着一些弱点：首先是对青年的思想动态与特点缺乏系统的了解，对团员和青年缺乏结合实际来系统的有计划的进行教育；团的领导上对团是以马列主义教育青年的学校认识不足，缺乏采取以说服教育的方法进行团的工作，教育广大青年自觉地完成党、政的中心任务。其次团与群众的联系一般的说是好的，但团的领导上还存在着形式主义和脱离群众等缺点。在团内存在着强迫命令、官僚主义作风。许多工作没有很好的团结群众一块干，团的组织作用发挥的不够。
    自东北四次省市团委书记会议提出“深入领导，改进作风，面向支部，面向群众”的号召后，团的各级干部积极参加了党的整风运动，特别是东北首届团代大会提出了“加强教育工作与密切联系群众”后，上述缺点已有某些纠正，在抗美援朝保家卫国运动以后，各地在工作上尤有显著的进步。但这些问题并未得到彻底解决。如在抗美援朝各种工作中，有的地方提出过左的口号，对群众要求过高，团员积极分子表现突出；并产生了形式主义的现象。在宣传教育上一般化，缺乏系统与计划，还没有把宣传教育工作贯彻到一切工作中去。
    因此东北青年团的工作今后尚须继续大力贯彻东北首届团代大会的精神，更进一步的提高团的领导，培养训练干部，团结教育广大青年群众，为完成祖国的经济建设与国防建设任务而努力前进。
