　　Propagandists Must Study Seriously Editor:
    On January 3rd at 13:52, on the train from Shuangqiao to Beijing, a train attendant pointed to a cartoon on the train and told the masses: "The 'April 12th' Incident was when the American imperialists bought off Chiang Kai-shek and massacred revolutionary communists on a large scale!" At that time, an old fellow villager asked, "In what year exactly was the 'April 12th' Incident?" The train attendant replied without hesitation, "It's not written on here, probably just these past few days!" This is obviously very wrong, a very irresponsible explanation, simply promoting for the sake of promoting, without considering the effect of the propaganda. I think this will not only have the opposite effect, but also reduce the public's trust in propagandists.
    In propaganda work, it is good for propagandists to pay attention to conducting propaganda to the masses through their work, using various methods, and this should continue to be promoted. However, it is more important to improve the political level of propagandists and cultivate a serious attitude towards work. Do not talk nonsense about things you do not know, otherwise it is easy to produce policy deviations.
    After the CCP Central Committee issued instructions on establishing a regular propaganda network for the people, various places are now starting to carry out this work. The issue of improving the political quality of propagandists is even more worthy of widespread attention.

### 宣传员要认真学习

　　宣传员要认真学习编辑同志：
    本月三日十三时五十二分，在由双桥去北京的火车上，列车员指着车上的漫画向群众宣传说：“‘四·一二’美帝收买蒋介石，大量屠杀革命的共产党人！”当时，有一老乡问：“‘四·一二’倒底在那一年呢？”该列车员毫不思索地回答说：“这上面没有写着，大概就在这几天吧！”这显然是很错误的，这是非常不负责任的解释，单纯为了宣传而宣传，并没有考虑到宣传的效果。我认为，这样不但会产生相反的影响，而且要减低群众对宣传员的信任。
    在宣传工作中，宣传员能注意通过自己的业务，利用各种方式向群众进行宣传，这是很好的，应该继续发扬。不过，更重要的是提高宣传员的政治水平，养成对工作的严肃性，不知道的事情不要乱说，否则很容易产生政策上的偏差。
    中共中央发布关于建立人民群众经常性的宣传网的指示发出后，各地都正着手开展这一工作，提高宣传员政治质量的问题，更值得引起普遍注意。
