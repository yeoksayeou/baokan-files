　　Why Implement Unified Purchase of Cotton Yarn?
　　The Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council issued the "Decision on Unified Purchase of Cotton Yarn" on the fourth of this month. This is an important decision concerning the current national economy, and it has a significant impact on the lives of people nationwide and economic work. The people of the whole country, especially all industrialists and businessmen, should support this decision.
　　Why implement unified purchase of cotton yarn? First of all, it is to ensure the people's need for clothing. In old China, the issue of clothing was always serious. More than 300 million farmers and some urban poor people across the country were often inadequately clothed. In remote areas and areas inhabited by ethnic minorities, the shortage of cloth was even more severe. After liberation, the shortage of cloth has been partially improved, but fundamentally, it has not been completely reversed.
　　The reasons for this phenomenon are different in the past and present. In the past, on the one hand, it was due to the cruel oppression of the working people by imperialism and the feudal class, which reduced the purchasing power of the vast working people for cloth to the lowest limit; on the other hand, it was also due to the backwardness of China's textile industry. Now, the situation is different. The farmers in the old liberated areas have gone through land reform and the restoration of agricultural production, and the farmers in the new liberated areas have also gone through rent reduction and deposit refunds. The lives of urban working people have also improved slightly. Their purchasing power for cloth has generally increased. Although the restoration of the textile industry made great achievements in 1950, the scale of the existing textile industry is far from meeting the needs of the Chinese population. According to statistical materials from 1948: if we look at the ratio of spindles to population in several Eastern countries, China has an average of 1.04 spindles per 100 people, India has 3.5, and Japan has 4.3. Of course, this does not mean that in capitalist countries, a larger spindle ratio is equal to a better solution to the clothing problem, but it also reflects the situation of insufficient spindles in our country. Of course, there is also some native yarn in China, but the distance from the needs is still very large. Not only that, during the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, the bureaucratic bourgeoisie not only did not try to solve the difficulties in this regard for the people, but also took the opportunity to increase their exploitation of the people. Yarn and cloth were one of the main objects of hoarding and speculation by bureaucratic capital, and also one of the most important materials that often led to rising prices in the past. In order to pursue huge profits, bureaucratic capitalists disregarded the needs of the domestic people for yarn and cloth and exported them to the Nanyang area in large quantities. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, China's cotton yarn exports were as high as 300,000 bales per year, and generally about 100,000 bales, accounting for 5% to 13% of the country's cotton yarn production at that time. After liberation, the People's Government, just like the grain issue, adopted a completely responsible attitude towards the people on the issue of yarn and cloth, which is related to the people's livelihood. Although the yarn and cloth problem has not been completely solved like the grain problem in the past year, a lot of work has been done on the production of cotton, yarn, and cloth. The first is to increase cotton production. In 1950, cotton production reached 14 million dan, second only to the highest output of 16 million dan in 1936; organizing the purchase of raw cotton to enrich the supply of raw materials; expanding the operation of spindles as much as possible; and increasing the operating time and shifts. As a result of this series of work, by October last year, the number of spindles in operation nationwide reached 92% of the equipment capacity, and the national output of yarn and cloth was close to the higher level before the war. The government neither organized exports nor did bureaucratic capital engage in hoarding and speculation for all these productions. Therefore, the amount of yarn and cloth consumed by the people nationwide last year actually far exceeded that of the Kuomintang rule. However, due to the victory of the Chinese revolution, the social and economic situation began to improve, and the consumption of yarn and cloth increased greatly. Since last autumn, the actual sales of yarn and cloth have been brisk, and all cities have exceeded the planned targets for the previous year, breaking the records of previous years. Under this circumstance, it is necessary to concentrate the strength of yarn and cloth and carry out appropriate distribution in order to reasonably supply the needs of the people, which is an urgent task of the People's Government.
　　The second purpose of unified purchase of cotton yarn is to stabilize prices. In the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to defend our homes and country, continuing to strive for price stability is a major task for the country at present. The main key to China's price problem is grain and yarn and cloth. With the full guarantee of grain nationwide, the key to the national price problem lies in yarn and cloth, especially cotton yarn. In a country like China where yarn and cloth are very insufficient, yarn and cloth have always been the most important objects of speculation. This is especially true in wartime. During the First World War and the War of Resistance Against Japan, many speculators engaged in yarn and cloth made a fortune. When speculation was rampant, a large amount of yarn and cloth was not used for production and normal consumption, but as a tool for speculation. According to materials from the Shanghai occupied area in the autumn of 1943, yarn and cloth accounted for 110,000 bales in the black market where speculative capital was active, which was an important factor in disrupting the market and raising prices. At present, in the case of relatively stable financial prices, it is of course impossible to have such large-scale speculative activities in the past, but after the expansion of the US imperialist aggression against Korea last autumn, speculators who attempted to obtain huge profits began to hoard cotton yarn again. In North China and Central China, the black market price of yarn was more than 2 million yuan higher than the listed price per bale, that is, one-third higher than the listed price. In this situation, yarn and cloth manufacturers also reduced or stopped selling finished products. Under the influence of yarn and cloth, tea merchants, oil and salt shops also scrambled to purchase, and at that time there was a tendency to affect the entire price. Thanks to the People's Government leading the workers of yarn mills across the country to increase cotton yarn production, and carrying out appropriate management of the yarn and cloth market, the cotton yarn turmoil did not break out. Therefore, in order to stabilize the yarn and cloth market so as not to affect prices, the state must fully control yarn and cloth, especially cotton yarn, on the one hand, to supply the people's needs in a planned way, and on the other hand, to prevent speculative behavior in the yarn and cloth market. If cotton yarn is allowed to run rampant in the free market, the result will be that the state will not be able to lead the yarn and cloth market, and will not be able to guarantee the needs of the people, then yarn and cloth may make a big mess in the market under the control of speculators, and then drive up other prices, thus destroying the price stability of the past eight months. This is extremely unfavorable to the people of the whole country. Moreover, once a yarn and cloth speculation turmoil occurs, yarn and cloth will inevitably become market chips, making useful materials deviate from production, which is a serious waste. Therefore, unified purchase of cotton yarn is the central link in centralized management of yarn and cloth. It is an important step to effectively manage the market.
　　There is no doubt that unified purchase of cotton yarn is welcomed by the people of the whole country. But, will it be detrimental to textile industrialists and businessmen? Is the unified purchase implemented by the People's Government the same as the "yarn and cloth control" of Japanese imperialism, the Wang Jingwei puppet government, and Chiang Kai-shek in the past?
　　Different! The two are fundamentally different in purpose and method! During the War of Resistance Against Japan, Japanese imperialism and the Wang Jingwei puppet government seized yarn and cloth in the occupied areas, which was plunder of the colonies; Chiang Kai-shek's forced purchase of yarn and cloth was an exhaustion of the people's resources. Therefore, their unified purchase not only greatly increased the burden on the people, but also was completely opposed to the industrial and commercial capitalists of the yarn and cloth industry. The method they used was to buy at low prices below cost and sell at high prices in order to seek private gain. And they used methods such as fines and imprisonment to coerce industrialists and businessmen. It was not for the people, nor was it for the yarn and cloth industrialists. For example, in 1943, the Japanese and Wang announced the "unified purchase of yarn and cloth" in Shanghai, and the purchase price stipulated was only one-third of the market price, and only one-sixth of the cash was paid at that time, and the rest was nominally postponed to two to three years later, which was actually equivalent to not paying. If there is any violation, a fine and imprisonment will be imposed. Chiang Kai-shek announced the "price assessment and purchase of yarn and cloth" in Chongqing in 1942, and the assessed price was only two-thirds to one-half of the market price, and the price was also in arrears, and manufacturers sold at a loss. At that time, due to the low price assessment and insufficient processing fees, some manufacturers repeatedly requested "the government to take over state-owned enterprises unconditionally." The People's Government's unified purchase of cotton yarn is completely different from that of the Japanese, Wang, and Chiang. Based on the common goal of ensuring the needs of the people and stabilizing prices, the government and the yarn mill capitalists cooperate in the spirit of cooperation. The government's purchase method clearly stipulates: to ensure the cost and profit of private enterprises. "The purchase price must accurately calculate the cost of the factory and give appropriate profits." "The processing fees for consignment spinning and weaving must also be appropriate." That is, to implement guaranteed capital and profits for yarn mill capitalists, and also to guarantee the supply of raw materials, factories can all produce stably, and yarn mill capitalists can further calculate costs, improve management, improve production efficiency, and strive for new reasonable profits under this stable situation. This method only strikes at a few speculators who seek huge profits, which is completely justified.
　　After the unified purchase of cotton yarn, a new phenomenon of rational production and sales will be seen in the cotton textile industry. Because this is a further cooperation between the state-owned economy and large-scale industry in private capital, the purpose of this cooperation is to ensure the needs of the people and the stability of the market. Therefore, the unified purchase of cotton yarn is not a technical issue of the trade company managing the market, but a major plan related to the national economy and the people's livelihood. Government agencies at all levels and the people of the whole country should be concerned about this issue and assist state-owned trade agencies in smoothly carrying out this major task.

### 为什么要统购棉纱？

　　为什么要统购棉纱？
    政务院财政经济委员会于本月四日发布“关于统购棉纱的决定”。这是有关目前国家经济的一个重要决定，在全国人民生活和经济工作中有重大作用。全国人民，尤其是全体工商业者都应当拥护这个决定。
    为什么要统购棉纱？这首先是为了保证人民穿衣的需要。在旧中国，穿衣问题，从来就是严重的。全国三万万以上的农民和一部分城市贫民，经常衣不蔽体。在交通偏僻地区和少数民族聚居的地区，缺布的现象，更为严重。在解放之后，缺布的现象，有了部分改善，但在基本上，仍未能彻底转变。
    这种现象发生的原因，过去和现在不同。在过去，一方面是由于帝国主义和封建阶级对劳动人民的残酷压榨，使广大劳动人民对于布的购买力，减到最低的限度；另一方面，也由于我国纺织工业的落后。在现在，情况不同了。老区的农民经过土地改革和农业生产的恢复，新区农民也经过减租退押。城市劳动人民的生活亦略有改进。他们对于布的购买力一般已经提高。纺织工业的恢复，在一九五○年中，虽有很大的成绩，但是现有的纺织工业的规模还远不能满足中国人口的需要。根据一九四八年的统计材料：如果拿东方几个国家所有纱锭与人口数的比例来看，我国每百人平均占有纱锭一点○四，印度有三点五，日本有四点三。这当然不是说，在资本主义国家中，纱锭比数大就等于穿衣问题解决得好些，但这也反映出我国纱锭不足的情况。当然，在中国，还有一些土纱，然而，与需要相去的距离仍然很大。不仅如此，在国民党反动派统治时代，官僚资产阶级不但不为人民设法解决这方面的困难，而且更借此加重对人民的剥削。纱布曾是官僚资本囤积居奇的主要对象之一，也是过去经常领导物价上涨的一种最主要的物资。为了追求暴利，官僚资本家不顾国内人民纱布的需要，曾经大量向南洋一带输出。抗战前，中国棉纱出口每年多至三十万件，一般的约有十万件，占当时全国棉纱产量的百分之五到百分之十三。解放以后，人民政府，对这样民生攸关的纱布问题，正如对粮食问题一样，完全采取对人民负责的态度。一年来，纱布问题虽然还没有像粮食问题一样已求得了彻底的解决，但对花、纱、布的生产上，已做了不少工作。首先是增产棉花。一九五○年棉花生产共达一千四百万担，仅次于一九三六年最高产量的一千六百万担；组织收购原棉，充实原料供应；尽量扩大纱锭开工；以及增加开工的时间与班次等。由于这一连串工作的结果，到去年十月，全国纱锭开动数已达设备数的百分之九十二，全国纱布生产量已接近战前较高的水平。所有这些生产，政府既不组织出口，也没有官僚资本从事囤积居奇。因此，去年全国人民所消费的纱布量，实际已远超过了国民党统治时代。但是，由于中国革命的胜利，社会经济情况开始好转，纱布消费量大为增加，去年秋季以后纱布实销畅旺，各城市皆超过去年预定计划，打破了历年纪录。在这种情况之下，就必须集中纱布力量，进行适当分配，才能合理地供应人民的需要，这是人民政府的一个迫切的任务。
    统购棉纱的第二个目的，是稳定物价。在抗美援朝保家卫国运动中，继续争取物价稳定，是国家当前一个重大任务。中国物价问题的主要关键是粮食和纱布。在全国粮食已有充分保证的情形下，全国性物价问题的关键在于纱布，尤其是棉纱。在中国这样纱布十分不足的国家，纱布从来就经常是投机的最主要的对象。在战争时期，尤其如此。在第一次世界大战及抗日战争期间，经营纱布的投机商，许多都大发横财。在投机盛行的时候，大量纱布不是用于生产与正常的消费，而是用作投机的工具。据一九四三年秋上海沦陷区的材料，投机资本活动的黑市中，纱布占有十一万件，这是一个扰乱市场，抬高物价的重要因素。目前在金融物价比较稳定的情况下，当然不可能有过去那样大的投机活动，但去年秋后，当美帝侵朝战争扩大之后，企图获得暴利的投机商，又开始囤积棉纱，在华北与华中黑市纱价每件曾高过牌价二百多万元，即高过牌价三分之一。这样情形下，纱布厂商便也减少或停止成品出售。在纱布影响下，茶叶商、油盐店也因此争相收购，当时颇有牵动整个物价之势。由于人民政府领导全国纱厂工人突击增产棉纱，并对纱布市场进行了适当的管理，棉纱风潮才没有爆发起来。所以为了稳定纱布市场以免牵动物价，国家必须全部掌握纱布，尤其是棉纱，一方面有计划地供应人民需要，另一方面，用此防止纱布市场上的投机行为。如果听任棉纱在自由市场横行，其结果，国家便无法领导纱布市场，也无法保证人民需要，则纱布可能在投机商操纵之下大闹市场，并进而带动其他物价上涨，因而破坏八个月来物价稳定的局面。这，对于全国人民是极端不利的。而且纱布投机风潮一旦发生，纱布必然变为市场筹码，使有用物资脱离生产，是一种严重的浪费。所以统购棉纱是集中管理纱布的中心环节。是有效地管理市场的一个重要步骤。
    毫无疑问，统购棉纱是全国人民所欢迎的。但是，对于纺织工商业家是否有损害呢？人民政府所实行的统购，是否和过去日本帝国主义、汪精卫伪政府和蒋介石的“纱布统制”相同呢？
    不同的！两者在目的和方法上根本不同的！抗日战争期间，日本帝国主义和汪精卫伪政府在沦陷区抢购纱布，是对殖民地的掠夺；蒋介石强购纱布，是竭泽而渔地对人民的榨取。所以他们统购时不但大大增加了人民负担，而且与纱布业工商资本家，完全处于对立地位。他们所用的办法是在成本以下的低价收买，高价出售，以图私利。并以罚款与监禁等对工商业家进行威逼。完全不是为人民，也不是为纱布工业家着想。例如，一九四三年日汪在上海宣布“统购纱布”，其所规定的收购价格只及市价的三分之一，而且当时只付现款的六分之一，其余则名义上推到两年至三年后还清，实际等于不付。如有违抗，则处以罚金与徒刑。蒋介石一九四二年在重庆宣布“核价收购纱布”，其核定的价格，亦只及市价的三分之二到二分之一，也是拖欠价款，厂商皆赔本售出。当时由于核价太低及工缴不敷，有些厂商再三要求“愿政府无条件收归国营”。人民政府统购棉纱，则与日汪蒋完全不同。在保证人民需要和稳定物价的共同目的基础上，政府与纱厂资本家在通力合作的精神上协商进行。政府收购办法中明白规定：保证私营成本与利润。“其收购价格，须确切计算厂方的成本，并给以适当利润。”“代纺代织的工缴，亦须适当。”即对纱厂资本家实行保本保利，而且保证原料供应，工厂均可以安定生产，纱厂资本家在这一种安定状况下，正可以进一步核算成本，改善经营，提高生产效能，争取新的合理利润。这一个办法，只打击少数图谋暴利的投机商人，是完全应该的。
    统购棉纱以后，在棉纺织工业中将可以看到一种新的产销合理的现象。因为这是国营经济与私人资本中的大工业的进一步的合作，这个合作的目的，在于保证人民需要与市场的稳定。所以统购棉纱，不是贸易公司管理市场的一个技术性的问题，而是关系国计民生的大计，各级政府机关和全国人民都应当关心这一个问题，并协助国营贸易机关顺利地进行这一个重大的工作。
