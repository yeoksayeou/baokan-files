　　A Long-Pending Case
    ——Letter from Jiao Langting, Weinan Prefectural Commissioner's Office, Shaanxi

    To the Editor:
    Sun Dechang, the acting Deputy Secretary-General of the former Dali Sub-district Commissioner's Office in Shaanxi, was from Dagen Village, Sixth Township, Qiaonan District, Hancheng County. After the liberation of Hancheng, when he was the principal of Zhichuan District Elementary School, his financial procedures were unclear, and he had withheld teachers' salaries. Later, he was transferred to work in the Huanglong Special District Commissioner's Office. In April 1949, he went to the Third Section of the Dali Special District Commissioner's Office as a clerk. Later, because Deputy Secretary-General Zhang Shaochuan took sick leave and returned home, Sun temporarily acted in his place. Sun then considered himself important, deceiving and misleading his superiors and looking down on his subordinates. For example, he frequently attacked Li Dehua, the affairs secretary, an old cadre who had been working for the revolution for many years. During the three months from July to October, Sun Dechang embezzled a total of 330,450 RMB, equivalent to 5,550 catties of wheat according to the old scale, in addition to frequently using public funds for business. As a result, the accounts of the Commissioner's Office had not been cleared for more than a year, the food was very poor, and the comrades expressed dissatisfaction. After it was discovered, the leadership talked to him several times, but he resolutely refused to admit the embezzlement and colluded with merchants to resist the organization. Only when faced with irrefutable evidence and witnesses did he finally confess the truth. At the time, this was indeed considered a major embezzlement case. Many cadres expressed great indignation at Sun Dechang's abandoning of important political affairs during his tenure as acting political secretary to engage in embezzlement and collude with merchants to engage in speculation in the market, causing great losses to state property and undermining the government's prestige. In order to educate the cadres and educate him, the leadership convened a conference of first-level cadres in the entire sub-district on December 1st of the previous year to combat corruption, and immediately handed him over to the original Dali Sub-court for handling, and he was taken into custody. The offender was released on bail for more than a month due to illness and was taken into custody again after recovery. In early April of last year, he went out to take care of his wife who was giving birth (living in Dali). After the merger of Dali and Weinan sub-districts, the Weinan Sub-court wrote to the Dali County People's Court to summon the offender to Weinan. The court reported that Sun Dechang had taken his wife and children to Xi'an on June 6th. It was also said that Commissioner Su Shiqing of the original Dali Special District Commissioner's Office had issued travel expenses and planned to assign him work. The Weinan Sub-court, on the grounds that the case was unresolved, requested the Shaanxi Provincial Government on June 23rd to return the offender, and on July 11th, received a letter from the Civil Affairs Department of the Provincial Government to the Weinan Special District Commissioner's Office saying: "According to Commissioner Su, this person (referring to Sun Dechang) did not come to Xi'an, and he said he had notified Sun Dechang to go to the Weinan Special District Commissioner's Office soon." But the offender never came to the Commissioner's Office. Although we repeatedly inquired, there was still no news, and we do not know why? Editor: Sun Dechang was handed over to the Dali Sub-court on December 1st of the year before last, and a full year has passed to December 1st of last year, and the case still cannot be closed. Sun Dechang has only handed over half of the embezzled money. In view of the above situation, I hope you will publish this letter in the newspaper, which may attract the attention of Comrade Su Shiqing. And I hope that the relevant agencies in Shaanxi will help solve this long-pending case.
                                    Jiao Langting, Weinan Prefectural Commissioner's Office, Shaanxi

　　一个久悬未决的案子
    ——陕西渭南专署焦朗亭来信编辑同志：
    陕西原大荔分区专员公署代理副政务秘书孙德昌，是韩城县原乔南区第六乡大耿村人，韩城解放后任芝川区完小校长时经济手续不清，曾克扣教员薪金，后调黄龙专署工作，一九四九年四月又至大荔专署三科任科员，后因副政务秘书张少川同志请病假返家，便由孙暂为代理。孙即认为了不起，对上级支应、蒙蔽，对下级看不起。如对革命多年的老干部事务秘书李德华同志经常打击。孙德昌自七月至十月三个月期间，除时常拿公家钱作生意外，共计贪污人民币三十三万零四百五十元，折合小麦老秤五千五百五十斤。由于这样，专署事务上一年多账没有算清，伙食搞的非常不好，同志们纷表不满。发觉后，领导上几次与他谈话，他却坚决不承认贪污事实，并勾结商人对抗组织，经人证物证无法诡辩时，始吐真言。在当时，这确算一贪污巨案。许多干部对于孙德昌在代理政务秘书期间，把政务大事抛开，进行贪污，勾结商人在市场上进行投机活动，使国家财产受到很大损失，丧失政府威信的事，表示非常气愤，纷纷要求严惩。领导上为了教育干部，教育其本人起见，于前年十二月一日召开全分区一级干部反贪污大会，当场送交原大荔分庭处理，遂即收管。该犯曾因病保外月余，病愈后管押。去年四月初因该犯妻子分娩（在大荔住）出外照顾。大荔与渭南两分区合并后，渭南分庭曾写信令大荔县人民法院传该犯来渭南。该院报称：孙德昌已于六月六日携带女人、孩子去西安。又据称是原大荔专署专员苏史青同志给发的路费，并准备调配工作。渭南分庭以该案未结，曾于六月二十三日呈请陕西省政府要求将该犯交回，于七月十一日接省府民厅给渭南专署来函说：“据苏专员谈：此人（指孙德昌）并未来西安，并称他已通知孙德昌很快到渭南专署。”但该犯始终未来专署。虽经我们一再催问，却始终没有下文，不知何故？编辑同志：孙德昌是前年十二月一日送交大荔分庭，至去年的十二月一日整整一年还不能结案。孙德昌贪污的赃物才交出一半。鉴于上述情况，我希望你们把这信登在报端，或许能够引起苏史青同志的注意。并希望陕西有关机关帮助解决这个久悬的案子。
