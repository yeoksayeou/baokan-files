Xinhua News Agency, Prague, January 24th: New York dispatch: William Z. Foster, Chairman of the National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States, published an article in the New York Daily Worker on the 16th, entitled "The Basis for Peace in Korea."

　　Foster pointed out: Establishing peace in Korea is obviously of utmost importance to the people of the world. Establishing a solid peace in Korea involves three major issues. These are the return of Taiwan to China, the seating of representatives of the People's Government of China at the United Nations, and the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea. All these issues are "Made in America," and this is of fundamental significance to the whole situation.

　　The United States has no right to occupy Taiwan, just as European countries have no right to seize control of Long Island (note: a large island outside New York Harbor). For centuries, Taiwan has been an integral part of China. The US occupation of Taiwan is a serious violation of Chinese sovereignty. Therefore, the "Taiwan problem" is entirely created by the United States. There can only be one answer to this problem: the immediate withdrawal of US armed forces from the area.

　　The "problem" of China's representation in the United Nations is also entirely a trick played by the United States. The People's Government of China clearly represents the 475 million people of China. Therefore, according to the provisions of the United Nations Charter, its right to participate in the United Nations is indisputable. Many countries have recognized this and support the participation of the People's China representatives in the United Nations. However, the US government, following the orders of Wall Street, insists on saying: No! It refuses to recognize the new China. It also relies on a mechanical majority in the United Nations—composed of representatives from European countries under the Marshall Plan and Wall Street's stooge representatives from Latin America—to constantly obstruct China from obtaining its seat in the United Nations. The United States has thus illegally created the "problem" of Chinese representation in the United Nations. The solution to this "problem" is for the pro-American bloc to stop its arbitrary and despicable opposition and allow the great Chinese people to take their rightful place in the United Nations.

　　The "problem" of withdrawing foreign troops from Korea was also arbitrarily and artificially created by the United States. Because it was the United States that first sent foreign troops to Korea to interfere in that country's civil war. This brutal American aggression against Korea is another savage attack on peace and on the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Korea and China. Therefore, on the subject of withdrawing all foreign troops from Korea, the responsibility should be borne by the United States, which first created this problem.

　　Regarding the establishment of peace in Korea, two things should clearly be kept in mind. The first is that all the obstacles to peace, the practical problems that peace seekers must solve, come entirely from aggressive American interventionism. The second fundamental fact is that aggressive American imperialism, which intends to conquer China as a major step in its quest for world hegemony, will never automatically agree to resolve any of the aforementioned issues related to Korea. Only overwhelming pressure can make it yield. That is to say, on the one hand, the unbreakable defense of the Chinese and Korean people; on the other hand, the resolute refusal of the peace-loving American people to allow themselves to be thrown by the reactionary Wall Street conspiracy into a devastating war against China and Korea. Therefore, the task of the American people to maintain world peace is very clear. This task is that we must restrain and defeat the Wall Street warmongers who now control our government; we must stop the insane war hysteria of declaring a "national emergency"; we must insist that the imperialistic hands of the Truman clique and MacArthur are not allowed to interfere with China, Korea, and other freedom-loving people in the Far East. In the current world crisis, only the powerful actions of the people of all countries can prevent another terrible world war.

### 美共主席福斯特著文  论《朝鲜和平的基础》

　　美共主席福斯特著文
    论《朝鲜和平的基础》
    【新华社布拉格二十四日电】纽约讯：美国共产党全国委员会主席福斯特十六日在纽约工人日报发表一篇论文，题为《朝鲜和平的基础》。
    福斯特指出：在朝鲜建立和平，对全世界人民显然具有最大的重要性。要在朝鲜建立巩固的和平，就牵涉到三个大问题。这就是把台湾交还中国，让中国人民政府的代表出席联合国，以及一切外国军队撤出朝鲜。所有这些问题全都是“美国制造的”，这一点对整个局势有着基本的意义。
    美国无权占领台湾，正如欧洲国家无权夺取长岛（按为纽约港外的一个大岛）的控制权一样，许多世纪以来，台湾就是中国的组成部分。美国之占领台湾，严重地侵犯了中国的主权。因此，台湾“问题”完全是美国一手制造的。这一问题只能有一个答案，这就是美国武装力量立刻撤出这个地区。
    中国在联合国的代表权“问题”，也完全是美国弄的鬼把戏。中国人民政府很明显地代表了中国四亿七千五百万人民，因此，按照联合国宪章的规定，它有权参加联合国乃是不容争辩的事。许多国家都已认识到这一点，而支持人民中国的代表参加联合国。但是，美国政府遵奉华尔街的命令，强调地说：不！它拒绝承认新中国。它还依靠着联合国中的机械多数——由欧洲马歇尔化国家的代表和来自拉丁美洲的华尔街走狗代表所组成——一直阻挠中国取得她在联合国的席位。美国就这样非法地制造了联合国内中国代表的“问题”。解决这个“问题”的办法，是亲美集团停止它的专断的卑鄙的反对，并且允许伟大的中国人民在联合国中取得他们应有的地位。
    从朝鲜撤出外国军队的“问题”，也是美国专断地、人工地制造出来的。因为正是美国最先派遣外国军队到朝鲜去，干涉那个国家的内战。美军对朝鲜的这种残暴侵略，乃是对和平、对朝鲜和中国的主权完整的又一凶暴进攻。所以，在一切外国军队撤出朝鲜的课题下，责任应该由首先制造这个问题的美国来负担。
    关于在朝鲜建立和平，有两件事情显然得记在心里。第一件是和平的一切障碍、和平谋求者所必须解决的实际问题，完全是来自侵略性的美国干涉主义。第二个基本事实是，意图征服中国作为争夺世界霸权的一大步骤的侵略性的美帝国主义，是决不会自动同意解决有关朝鲜的任何上述问题的。只有占优势的压力才能使它屈服。这就是说，一方面是中朝人民的牢不可破的防御；另一方面是爱好和平的美国人民坚决拒绝让自己被反动的华尔街阴谋投到反对中国与朝鲜的毁灭性战争中去。因此，美国人民为维持世界和平而斗争的任务是很清楚的。这个任务就是，我们必须约制并击败现在控制着我们政府的华尔街的战争贩子们；我们必须制止宣布“全国紧急状态”的疯狂的战争歇斯底里；我们必须坚持，杜鲁门之流与麦克阿瑟的帝国主义的手，不准干涉中国、朝鲜以及远东其他爱好自由的人民。在目前世界危机中，只有各国人民的有力行动，才能阻止另一次可怕的世界战火。
