    Huguan Militia Heroes Xu Shunhai and Zhang Xiaobao
    Challenge All County Militiamen
    To Protect and Promote Winter Production in the Whole Village

Comrade Editor:

    Xu Shunhai, a militia hero from Changxing Village, Huguan County, Shanxi Province, who attended the National Congress of Combat Heroes, and Zhang Xiaobao, a militia hero from the former Taihang District, have issued a challenge to all county militiamen to protect and promote winter production in the whole village. They have already achieved good results. All village party members and cadres have made specific divisions of labor to lead production. Xu Shunhai and Zhang Fuk科 are responsible for leading four coal kilns, with fifty-six workers mining coal. The original plan was to produce 1,100 baskets of coal per day. Due to the implementation of democratic management, the workers' enthusiasm for production has been increased. In thirty-seven days, the actual output of coal was 48,100 baskets, 7,400 baskets more than the original plan, earning a total of 120 shi of millet. Zhang Xiaobao actively led the militia to carry out military and political training, and did a good job in winter defense, so that the masses could produce with peace of mind. All 105 young men and women in the village have joined winter school, and 28 old men have also voluntarily participated in the study. Party member Zhang Qishun took the lead and mobilized the masses to transport fertilizer to the fields. Of the 40 carts in the village, 38 have been organized into eight groups, transporting 42,050 loads of fertilizer. Xu Haishui, the Party branch secretary of the village, and party member Xu Jiashun actively participated in the work of the cooperative. In addition to solving the daily necessities of the members such as salt, oil, and printed cloth, they also organized seven carpenters and blacksmiths to repair and make farm tools to meet the needs of all farmers in the village. Party member Wang Ainu and others organized women to re-dry all 40 shi and two dou of fine seeds selected in the autumn for the big production this year.
