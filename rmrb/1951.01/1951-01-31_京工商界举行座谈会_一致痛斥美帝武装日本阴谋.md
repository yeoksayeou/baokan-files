　　Beijing Industrial and Commercial Circles Hold Symposium
　　Unanimously Condemning the U.S. Imperialist Plot to Arm Japan

[Report from this newspaper] At the symposium held by Beijing industrial and commercial circles on the afternoon of the 30th, the heads of various trade associations present unanimously condemned the U.S. imperialist's shameless plot to arm Japan. Fu Huating, Chairman of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, said: After suffering a disastrous defeat in its aggression against Korea, U.S. imperialism is attempting to use Japan as a base for aggression against Asia in order to use the Japanese people as cannon fodder. However, this conspiracy is doomed to failure. The Chinese and Soviet people firmly oppose it, and the Japanese people also strongly oppose it, because this is tantamount to sending the Japanese people to their graves. If U.S. imperialism recklessly and unilaterally concludes a peace treaty with Japan, the powerful strength of the people of China and the Soviet Union and the people of all Asia and the world will surely be able to crush it. We, the industrial and commercial circles of Beijing, have decided to further promote the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea more extensively and deeply, implement the five patriotic covenants, and use these practical actions to effectively counter this aggressive conspiracy of U.S. imperialism. He Yongchang, Chairman of the Oil, Salt, Sauce and Vinegar Trade Association, said: Japanese imperialism is the deadly enemy of the Chinese people. For decades, our people have suffered enough from its harm. Today, when I mention the U.S. imperialists' attempt to use the Japanese army to invade our country, I naturally think of the devastation of the oil, salt, sauce, and vinegar industry during the Japanese occupation. I must mobilize all colleagues in our industry to improve labor-management relations, improve product quality, reduce production costs, and prosper our country's economy as an effective counterattack against this conspiracy of U.S. imperialism. Jiang Xiaoqiu, Chairman of the Soap and Alkali Manufacturing Trade Association, said: The Chinese people and the Japanese bandits have an irreconcilable hatred. During the Japanese invasion of China, our soap and alkali manufacturing industry almost went bankrupt: the Japanese aggressors controlled the raw materials, and Japanese-made Fan brand and Cow brand soaps flooded the market. The Chinese people paid a very heavy price to win the victory in the war against Japan, and the U.S. imperialists are even attempting to deprive us of the right to participate in the peace treaty with Japan. We will do everything in our power to support the People's Government and resolutely smash the conspiracy of U.S. imperialism. Qin Zhibu, Chairman of the Native Bank Trade Association, said: We must expose to the world the U.S. imperialists' violation of international law. We must use every means to build a strong national defense force in our country so that it can effectively protect our country's security and defend peace in the East and the world. Zhang Yinting, Chairman of the Machinery Industry Trade Association, said: During the period of Japanese occupation, our machinery industry had only more than 1,000 employees and workers under the enemy's heavy oppression. After liberation, with

　　京工商界举行座谈会
　　一致痛斥美帝武装日本阴谋
    【本报讯】在三十日下午北京工商业界所举行的座谈会上，到会的各同业公会负责人，一致痛斥美帝武装日本的无耻阴谋。工商业联合会主任委员傅华亭说：美帝在侵略朝鲜惨败之后，企图把日本作为侵略亚洲的基地，以便利用日本人民当炮灰。但是这一阴谋是注定要失败的，中国人民和苏联人民坚决反对，日本人民也强烈反对，因为这无异把日本人民送到坟墓里。美帝如果悍然不顾一切地对日单独媾和，强大的中苏两国人民和全亚洲全世界的人民力量，一定能够粉碎它。我们北京工商界决定把抗美援朝运动更广泛深入地推进一步，贯彻五项爱国公约，用这些实际行动，有力地回击美帝国主义这一侵略阴谋。油盐酱醋业同业公会主任委员贺永昌说：日本帝国主义是我们中国人民的死敌，几十年来我国人民受够了它的残害。今天一提到美帝企图利用日本军队来侵略我国，我自然地就想到日寇占领时期油盐酱醋业被摧残的情形。我一定要动员我们行业的全体同人，搞好劳资关系，提高产品质量，降低生产成本，繁荣我们国家的经济，作为对美帝这一阴谋的一个有效回击。造胰制碱业同业公会主任委员姜笑秋说：中国人民和日寇有着不共戴天之仇。在日寇侵华时期，我们造胰制碱业几乎全部破产：日本侵略者统制了原料，日本造的扇面牌、牛牌的肥皂充斥市场。我国人民付出了极重的代价才获得对日战争的胜利，美帝竟然企图剥夺我们参加对日和约的权利。我们决尽一切力量支持人民政府，坚决粉碎美帝的阴谋。钱庄业同业公会主任委员秦芝圃说：我们要向全世界揭露美帝违反国际公法的行为。我们要用一切办法建设我国强大的国防军，使它有效地保卫我国的安全，并捍卫东方和世界和平。机器业同业公会主任委员张荫庭说：在日寇占领的时期，我们机器业在敌人的重重压迫下，连职员工人只有一千多人。解放后在人民政府的扶持下，我业已发展到六千多人。我们热爱人民政府，热爱我们和平幸福的生活。在市人民政府和工商联的领导下，我业积极地参加了抗美援朝的爱国运动，今天决以坚决实行五项爱国公约，来表示我们反对美帝武装日本的阴谋。电影业同业公会主任委员杨宜之说：在电影业短短的几十年的历史中，我们曾不自觉地充当过帝国主义文化侵略我国的工具。今天在抗美援朝的运动中，我们已经认清了美帝的侵略面目，提高了自己的政治认识，今后决以电影这一有力武器，来打击美帝武装日本的阴谋。在座谈会上讲话的尚有营造业同业公会主任委员刘元敬、火柴业同业公会主任委员丁步洲、土产品品业同业公会主任委员卢炳光和银行业同业公会委员唐庆永等，他们对于美帝的这一狂妄无理举动表示了极大的愤慨，决以搞好工商业的实际行动，来表示反对美帝武装日本的决心。
