　　Judicial Workers Should Handle Mass Accusation Cases Swiftly and Accurately
    With the efforts of all the judicial workers, the work of the people's courts has made great achievements in the past. However, it must be pointed out that this achievement is still quite far from the demands of the masses. According to letters from readers in various places, the most opinions about the courts and the most dissatisfaction are about delaying and shelving cases. These delayed and shelved cases include all kinds of cases. The result of the people's cases being shelved is that the interests of the people are greatly damaged.
    For example, the case of Zhang Wenxiu, director of the Changzhi Post Office, privately setting up a criminal court and forcing Wang Huichun, a female postal worker of the bureau, to death (see "People's Garden" in this newspaper on August 9, 1950) occurred on May 17 last year. It has been more than half a year and has not yet been processed. This has a very bad impact on the masses. The case changed hands several times. On August 16 last year, the Shanxi Provincial Post Office sent Zhang Wenxiu to the Shanxi Provincial Court for handling. We have inquired several times about the handling of the case. Until recently, the Shanxi Provincial Court replied: Because there is no material, it cannot be processed yet. (According to a letter from the Shanxi Provincial Procuratorate to this newspaper, the matter has been investigated.) It also said: Our central task is to handle counter-revolutionary cases, so we have not grasped it tightly. Yes, counter-revolutionary criminals are hated by everyone and should be dealt with promptly. But can other cases, such as Zhang Wenxiu's case of violating the people's laws, be delayed and shelved for half a year without being resolved?
    Have all counter-revolutionary criminals cases been handled promptly? Here is a letter from Comrade Zhang Lin, Director of the Fangshan County Public Security Bureau, in early December last year:
    "...The counter-revolutionary murderer and Kuomintang secret agent Luo Xiang (also known as Luo Zanhou) is from Tiankai Village, Fourth District, Fangshan County. During the period of Japanese puppet and Kuomintang rule, he served as a squad leader, platoon leader, director of the Fourth Police Station, and leader of the military intelligence team of the puppet army and the Fangshan County Security Team. In March 1947, he personally killed Zhang Shangxian, a villager of Tiankai Village, and the wife of Zhang Wenhan, Cao Ming of Erlonggang Village, etc., and instigated the secret service captain Wei Yongfu to encircle five cadres of our district in Erlonggang and kill our district chief Han Xiaogeng with machine guns. When Fangshan was liberated in the winter of 1948, the criminal surrendered his weapons and returned to the village, and then organized counter-revolutionary elements to sabotage land reform work. After being accused by the masses, the Public Security Bureau of the People's Government of our county arrested the criminal on March 6, 1949, and filed a lawsuit with the County People's Court on April 3. It was not until November 2, 1949, that the County People's Court sentenced the criminal to three years of imprisonment. However, because the sentence was inappropriate, the Tongxian Branch of the Hebei Provincial Court instructed a retrial. The County Judicial Committee re-examined the case on October 21 this year and decided to change the sentence to death. But it has been a month and sixteen days now, and the People's Court of our county has not yet reported it."
    There are two other similar cases in the county.
    These cases have been delayed for nearly two years. Until Comrade Zhang Lin's letter, the Fangshan Court had not handled it properly.
    Even a civil case involving a dispute over property is also delayed. The case described in Wang Qingyou's letter published today has not had any results for more than a year. We don't know who is right and who is wrong. But the Tianjin Municipal Court should not have accumulated this case for a year without processing it.
    The masses hope that these cases, big and small, will be clarified and resolved quickly. Obviously, resolving these cases of the masses quickly and accurately protects the legitimate interests of the masses.
    Indeed, the people's judicial workers are busy. After the liberation of major cities, there are many accusations from the people, which shows that the broad masses of people trust their government to solve problems for them. This is a manifestation of the people's awareness. Therefore, our judicial workers should also shoulder their important responsibilities and not disappoint the expectations of the people.

### 司法工作者应迅速准确处理群众控诉案件

　　司法工作者应迅速准确处理群众控诉案件
    人民法院的工作，在全体人民司法工作者的努力下，过去是获得了很大成绩的。但必须指出，这个成绩和群众的要求比起来，还有相当距离。根据各地读者来信反映，对法院意见最多；最不满意的，是拖延搁置案件。这些被拖延搁置下来的，包括各种各样的案件。人民的案件被搁置的结果，是使人民的利益受到很大的损害。
    如长治邮局局长张文秀私设刑庭逼死该局女邮务员王惠春案（见本报一九五○年八月九日《人民园地》），事情是去年五月十七日发生，到现在辗转半年多，仍未处理，这在群众中的影响是很不好的。该案几度转手，去年八月十六日由山西省邮局将张文秀送山西省法院法办。我们曾几次询问该案处理结果，直到最近一次，山西省法院回答：因为没有材料，还不能处理。（根据山西省检察署给本报来信，说事情已调查清楚。）又说：我们的中心工作是处理反革命案件，因此未抓紧。是的，反革命罪犯是人人痛恨的，应该抓紧处理。但是其他案件，象张文秀这样违犯了人民法律的案件，就可以拖延搁置起来半年还不解决吗？
    是不是对反革命罪犯案件都抓紧处理了呢？这里有一封房山县公安局长张林同志去年十二月上旬的来信：
    “……反革命杀人罪犯、军统特务罗襄（又名罗赞侯），房山县四区天开村人，日伪及国民党统治时期，历任伪军及房山县保安队小队长、中队长、警察四分所所长和军统情报组组长等职。一九四七年三月，他亲手杀死天开村村民张尚贤及张文汉之妻、二龙岗村曹明等，并主使特务队长隗永福于二龙岗包围我五区干部五人，用机枪打死我区长韩晓耕。一九四八年冬房山解放时，该犯缴械投降，回村后又组织反革命分子破坏土地改革工作。经群众控诉，我县人民政府公安局于一九四九年三月六日将该犯逮捕，四月三日向县人民法院起诉，直到一九四九年十一月二日，县人民法院才宣判该犯有期徒刑三年。但因刑量不当，河北省法院通县分院指示更审。县司法委员会又于今年十月二十一日重新研究，决定改判死刑。但至今已有一个月又十六天，我县人民法院尚未向上申报。”
    该县同样的案子还有两起。
    这几个案件拖了已近两年，直到张林同志来信时止，房山法院仍没恰当的处理。
    就从一件诉讼财帛纠纷的民事案件来说，也是拖延。今天发表的王庆猷来信中所叙述的案件，也有一年多没有结果。孰是孰非，我们不知道。但天津市法院无论如何是不应当把这个案件积压一年而不处理的。
    群众就是希望把这些大大小小的案件，是非曲直弄清楚，迅速求得解决。很明显，迅速而准确地解决群众的这些案件，就是保护了群众的正当利益。
    确实，人民的司法工作者是繁忙的。各大城市解放后，人民的控诉很多，这说明了广大人民信任自己的政府能给他解决问题，这是人民觉悟的表现。我们的司法工作者因此也更应担起自己的重任，不要辜负了人民的期望。
