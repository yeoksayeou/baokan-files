　　Under the Shadow of Inertia and Bureaucracy

　　In the agencies of the Ukrainian Republic, the prevailing opinion has long been that Comrade Rudò, the director of the Printing Industry, Publishing Industry, and Book Trading Industry Administration affiliated with the Ukrainian Council of Ministers, belongs to the type of people who talk more than they do. Whenever he attends any important meeting or discussion, he always says that he is prepared to ensure the improvement of the standards of the entire Ukrainian printing and publishing industry. However, Comrade Rudò's promises remain just promises.
    
　　The Ukrainian Printing and Publishing Administration was established to improve and unify the leadership of printing, publishing, and book trading operations in the republic. It unifies five national and twenty-five provincial publishing houses, many printing enterprises, and a network of trade branches.

　　Our government and Party attach great importance to publishing. Like the rest of the country, the Ukrainian printing industry is equipped with first-class machinery year by year and receives thousands of tons of paper and other materials. Dozens of educational institutions are training expert cadres.

　　However, there are many areas in the book publishing work that need improvement, because the Ukrainian Printing and Publishing Administration only provides formal leadership to its affiliated institutions and lacks in-depth professional knowledge itself. Inertia and bureaucracy are deeply entrenched here, disregarding advanced working methods, and ignoring new and more modern technologies and rationalization.

　　Everyone knows how high the demands are for product quality in our country, and the quality of printed materials is of course included. However, many printing enterprises under the unified leadership of the Ukrainian Printing and Publishing Administration still publish inferior printed products. Entire pages of the *Kirov Truth* are blurred and illegible with ink, the entire sheet of the *Vinnitsa Truth* is greyish-black, and thousands of books printed by the Lviv "Map" Printing Plant, as well as color propaganda posters printed by the Kiev Color Printing Plant in grey, brown, and red, are rejected due to poor printing. All this clearly shows that the Ukrainian Printing and Publishing Administration has left the struggle to improve product quality behind.

　　Studying the history of the organization of deep-tone and color printing enterprises can be very instructive.
    
　　Deep-tone printing can greatly improve the quality of published books. Five years ago, the republic received four highly productive deep-tone rotary printing presses. When these machines fell into the hands of their owners, they were expected to bring about a reform in the printing industry. However, Comrade Rudò considered the new technology a heavy burden. These valuable deep-tone rotary printing presses have been left out in the open, rusting and deteriorating. Comrade Rudò is helpless.

　　"The technology is indeed extensive," the indolent leader declared, "but we are powerless, unable to master it, and lack cadres."

　　It is true that things are relatively more fortunate in color printing. A specialized color printing factory was established in Kiev, which could have made many improvements in the printing of color magazines, propaganda posters, and other printed materials. However, due to an irresponsible attitude towards the installation and mastery of factory equipment, it still produces inferior products.

　　The situation has developed to the point where the Ukrainian Printing and Publishing Administration has completely refused to produce many important products in the factory. Now, powerful collotype printing machines are only used to print labels and trademarks. As a result, the machines are not even working at half capacity.

　　"There are no cadres," Comrade Rudò again attempted to defend himself.

　　Using cadres as an excuse is worthless. The Ukrainian Printing and Publishing Administration should have cared about cadres, but since its establishment, it has not trained a single expert in deep-tone printing, collotype printing, or retouching for the printing industry.

　　Many examples show the conservative attitude of the leaders of the Ukrainian Printing and Publishing Administration towards the use of new technologies. Book printing houses are experiencing difficulties due to a lack of highly productive printing presses. In the warehouse of the Ukrainian Printing and Publishing Administration, first-class rotary printing presses have been left unused for four years. How many excellent books could this machine have printed in these years!

　　Two provincial newspapers are published in the city of Nikolaev. These newspapers are often delivered to readers very late. The reason is that the two newspapers are printed alternately on an old machine. At the same time, new rotary printing presses have been stored in the printing plant's warehouse for two years.

　　Many rationalization proposals from innovators in the printing industry cannot conquer the stone wall of inertia and bureaucracy, which separates the Ukrainian Printing and Publishing Administration from active members of production.

　　The case of Mikhaichenko's new invention has attracted attention. Comrade Mikhaichenko, a talented young expert working in the editorial department of the *Desnianskaia Pravda* newspaper in Chernigov Province, proposed his newly invented electric typesetting linotype. Although it still needs to be tested, Mikhaichenko's invention opens up vast prospects for increasing typesetting speed and accelerating newspaper production. The inventor requested the Ukrainian Printing and Publishing Administration. He ran around for two months without result, nearly wearing down the threshold of the Administration, but even this failed to overcome the bureaucratic barriers. Comrade Rudò was unwilling to even talk to the inventor. Only after the intervention of the Chernigov Provincial Committee and the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of Ukraine did the work begin to make progress. However, the Ukrainian Printing and Publishing Administration is still not very interested in implementing the invention.

　　Such instances of bureaucracy and inertia are countless not only in the printing industry but also in the leadership of the publishing and book trading industries.

　　Among the senior leaders of the Republic's Administration, there are personnel who are irresponsible in their positions. Comrade Qiūsitov, a leader here, is a leather-making expert. Comrade Feideliman, who leads the publishing business, is a financial accountant himself.

　　The Propaganda and Agitation Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of Ukraine is taking a strangely indifferent attitude, at least on this issue. The staff of the department has never examined the work of the Ukrainian Printing and Publishing Administration, although they have written dozens of perfunctory reports, and everything remains the same.

　　Instead of strengthening the cadre work of the Ukrainian Printing and Publishing Administration, the Propaganda and Agitation Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of Ukraine is taking over the functions of others, extending its reach to the smallest aspects of care in the printing, publishing, and book trading industries. Such practices may not improve the work.

### 在因循势力与官僚主义笼罩之下

　　在因循势力与官僚主义笼罩之下
    在乌克兰共和国的各机关里，早已形成了这样的舆论，说是附属于乌克兰部长会议的印刷业，出版业，书籍贸易业管理局局长鲁多同志是属于多说少做那一类的人。他无论出席任何重要会议或讨论，总是说准备保证提高一切乌克兰印刷出版业的水准。但是鲁多同志的许约终竟是许约。
    乌克兰印刷出版管理局的成立是为了改善共和国内印刷业、出版业和书籍贸易业务行动的领导与统一。它统一五个国立、二十五个省立出版业、许多印刷企业和分支的贸易网。
    我们政府和党对于出版事业予以极大重视。乌克兰的印刷业同全国的一样，一年一年均以头等的机器装备起来，并获得几千吨的纸张和其他材料。又有数十个教育机关培养着专家干部。
    然而，这里对出版书籍工作方面有许多地方需要改善，这是因为乌克兰印刷出版管理局对其所属机构只是形式上的领导，而本身并无精通的业务知识。此处坚强地潜伏着因循作风和官僚主义，轻视先进的劳动方法，不理睬新的更近代的技术与合理化。
    大家都知道，在我们国内对产品质量提出的要求是多么高啊，其中印刷品的质量当然也包括在内。但是乌克兰印刷出版管理局所统一领导的许多印刷企业仍然出版劣等印刷品，《基洛夫真理报》整版被油墨模糊得看不清楚，《维尼察真理报》全张都是黑灰色，里沃夫“地图”印刷厂所印行的成千部的书籍以及基辅彩色印刷厂所发印的灰、褐、红三色宣传画报，都因印坏而被挑出，这一切都显然说明了乌克兰印刷出版管理局对提高产品质量工作的斗争置于脑后。
    研究深色和彩色印刷企业组织的历史是很能获得经验教训的。
    深色印刷术能大大的改善出版书籍的质量。五年以前该共和国领到了四部有高度生产力的深色联动印刷机。这些机器一落到主人们的手中，他们对印刷事业方面当能有一番改革的，可是由于鲁多同志认为新技术是一种沉重的负担。这些宝贵的深色联动印刷机直到现在还被抛在露天底下，任其生锈，毁坏。而鲁多同志却又束手无策。
    ——技术确实很多——怠惰的领导者声言道——但是我们无能为力，不能掌握它，没有干部。
    不错，在彩色印刷方面是较为幸运些，在基辅设立专门彩色印刷厂，它对于印刷套色杂志，宣传画报和其他印刷品方面是可以做出许多的改善工作的，但是因为对于装置和精通工厂设备抱着不负责任的态度，结果使它仍然出劣等产品。
    事情发展到这种地步，逼迫得乌克兰印刷出版管理局在工厂中完全拒绝了生产许多重要的产品。现在以强大的珂罗版印刷机仅仅印些签条和商标。因此，机器连一半工作也没有做到。
    ——没有干部，——鲁多同志又企图辩护。
    一切拿干部作为借口是没有任何价值的。乌克兰印刷出版管理局本应关心干部，而自创办以来他却没有为印刷业培养出一个深色印刷、珂罗版、修版的专家。
    从许多实例中可以看到乌克兰印刷出版管理局的领导者们对使用新技术的保守态度。书籍印刷所因缺少高度生产力的印刷机而感受困难。而在乌克兰印刷出版管理局的库房中头等的自转印书机却白放了四年而不用。在这几年中这架机器该能印出多少出色的书籍呵！
    尼古拉耶夫城内出版两种省的报纸。这些报纸经常很晚才能送到读者手中。原因是，因为两种报纸用一架陈旧的机器轮流印刷。而同时在印刷厂的库房里新的自转印刷机已存放了有两年之久。
    印刷业革新者的许多合理化建议不能征服因循作风和官僚主义的石墙，这堵石墙把乌克兰印刷出版管理局和生产中的积极分子隔离开了。
    米哈依联科新发明的事件引起了注意。在彻尔尼郭夫省《德斯业斯克真理报》报馆的编辑部工作的天才的青年专家米哈依联科同志提出了他所发明的新颖铸字电动排版联合机。米哈依联科同志的发明对于提高排版速度和加速报纸产量上开辟了广大的前途，虽然还需加以试验。发明者请求乌克兰印刷出版管理局。他毫无结果地跑了两个月，差不多将管理局的门限都踏平了，但这样也未能攻克官僚主义的关口。鲁多同志甚至不愿与发明者谈话。只有经过彻尔尼郭夫省委和乌共（布）中央鼓动、宣传科的干涉以后工作才开始有了进展。但乌克兰印刷出版管理局现在对于实现发明的工作仍然不感很大的兴趣。
    这种官僚主义、因循作风的事实不仅在印刷业方面，而在出版业和书籍贸易业的领导中也同样是不胜枚举的。
    在共和国管理局的上层领导者中尚存在着对自己的职务不负责的人员。此地领导干部的裘斯托夫同志是个制革专家。领导出版事业的费得力曼同志本人是财政会计学家。
    乌共（布）中央宣传、鼓动科至少在这一问题上，是采取着令人奇怪的态度。该科的工作人员对乌克兰印刷出版管理局的工作一次也没有审查过，虽然写过几十次应付性的报告文件，而一切仍然是照旧。
    乌共（布）中央宣传、鼓动科不是去作巩固乌克兰印刷出版管理局干部工作，而是将他人的职权取而代之，一直深入到印刷业、出版业和书籍贸易业方面微小的照顾工作。这样的做法未必能对工作有所改善吧。
