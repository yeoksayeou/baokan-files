　　Wuxi City's Worker Reading Groups
    Su Nan Daily Reading Group
    Since the General Administration of News proposed strengthening the connection between newspapers and the masses, we began establishing reading groups in May 1950. After a period of exploration, we later focused our efforts on establishing worker reading groups in various factories in Wuxi City. This work received strong cooperation from the Wuxi City Federation of Trade Unions, which promoted and called on workers in various factories to explain that good reading can effectively improve workers' political awareness and cultural knowledge. The factory trade unions also regarded reading work as part of the political and cultural education work for workers. In less than two months, more than 180 reading groups were organized in various factories in Wuxi City, with more than 1,800 employees participating in reading. These employees regularly read newspapers, which greatly helped the work of the trade union and promoted production.
    Among these reading groups, the ones with better reading results were those that could closely integrate with ideological education and production, and conduct reading based on work needs and workers' requirements. For example, after reading the news about the reduction of substandard cloth in the Huilun Weaving Factory, the reading group of the Hengfeng Weaving Factory, in connection with the situation in their own factory, improved after research and reduced the substandard cloth. After reading the news about the new creations of workers in the Shenxin Factory, the worker reading group of the Huanong Rice Mill was inspired to improve the rice milling machine's huller groove and reduce broken rice. There are many such examples. Workers have a relatively correct understanding of the significance of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, knowing that US imperialism is a paper tiger, and with the help of the Chinese People's Volunteers, they have enough confidence in the victory of the Korean people. The reading group has played a great role in this. The reading group promoted the peace signature movement among workers, promoted patriotic production competitions, and publicized the Land Reform Law and the Marriage Law.
    The reading methods of the reading groups are also diverse and lively. Some reading groups have created a reading method of "reading, asking, and discussing." Some groups also learned new characters after reading the newspapers. Some groups selected materials from newspaper news, communications, and essays, and compiled them into quick clapper rhymes to sing. For example, the head of a reading group at the Huanong Rice Mill compiled the news of the Korean people's liberation of Seoul into a quick clapper rhyme, which was very popular among the masses. Many workers have become very interested in reading. Some workers in Qingfeng Yarn Factory said: "Reading is addictive." Some people quit smoking cigarettes and saved money to subscribe to newspapers. Zhang Yiyou, a model worker in Shenxin No. 3 Factory, who knew very few characters himself, also subscribed to a newspaper, and every day after get off work, he would ask his son to read it to him.

　　无锡市的工人读报组
    苏南日报读报工作组
    自新闻总署提出加强报纸与群众的联系后，我们于一九五零年五月即开始建立读报组的工作。经过一个时期的摸索，后来就集中力量，在无锡市各工厂中建立工人读报组。这一工作，曾得到无锡市总工会的有力配合，由总工会向各厂工人宣传、号召，说明很好的读报可以有效地提高工人的政治觉悟和文化知识，各厂工会并把读报工作作为对工人进行政治、文化教育工作的一部分。不到两个月，无锡市各厂就组织了一百八十多个读报组，参加读报的职工有一千八百余人。这些职工经常读报，对工会工作和推动生产都有很大帮助。
    在这些读报组中，读报成绩较好的，都是由于能和思想教育及生产紧密结合，并根据工作需要和工人的要求进行读报。如恒丰织布厂的读报组，读了汇纶织布厂次布减少的新闻后，即联系本厂情况，经过研究改进，减少了次布。华农米厂的工人读报组，读了申新工厂工人的新创造的新闻，引起他们改进了碾米机的砻槽，减少了碎米。这样的事例很多。对抗美援朝的意义，工人都有了比较正确的认识，知道美帝是纸老虎，在中国人民志愿军的帮助下，对朝鲜人民的胜利有足够的信心，读报组在这中间曾起了很大的作用。读报组在工人中推动了和平签名运动，推动了爱国主义生产竞赛，宣传了土地改革法和婚姻法。
    读报组的读报方法，也是多种多样、生动活泼的。有的读报组创造了“一读二问三讨论”的读报方法。有的组读了报纸，还学习了生字。有的组则选定报纸新闻、通讯、论文的材料，编成快板来说唱。如华农米厂的某读报组长，把朝鲜人民解放汉城的新闻编成快板说唱，很受群众欢迎。很多工人对读报引起很大兴趣，庆丰纱厂有些工人说：“读报读上瘾了。”有的人戒掉纸烟，省下钱订报，申新三厂生产模范张义友自己识字很少，也订了一份报，每天下班回家，就叫儿子读给他听。
