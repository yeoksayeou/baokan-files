　　Changzhi Special District Cooperative
    Promoting the Sales of Local Products Through Joint Operations
    [Report from this newspaper] The Changzhi Special District Cooperative in Shanxi Province, in order to promote material exchange and vigorously market local products of its members, has adopted a joint operation method to organize the business of the sixteen county cooperatives in the district, thereby enhancing the planning of the cooperative's business operations. Due to the concentrated use of manpower and resources, and joint operations, it is easier to exchange information on the supply and demand situation in various regions, and significant results have been achieved in promoting sales and purchasing local products, with some even exceeding the original plan. According to statistics from September 1st to November 10th last year, the district sold 220,000 jin of peach kernels, 97,000 jin of medicinal materials (such as codonopsis pilosula and schisandra chinensis), and over 600,000 jin of Sichuan pepper, hemp seeds, and white melon seeds within two months. Among them, the sales of peach kernels accounted for 38% of the district's total output, and the purchase of codonopsis pilosula exceeded the original plan by 58%, while Sichuan pepper exceeded by 55%. It supplied members with over 553,000 bolts of homespun cloth, over 4,000 bolts of city-produced cloth, 360,000 jin of salt, and over 18,000 jin of kerosene.
    This joint operation is formed under the principle of voluntary participation. The purchasing funds are contributed by the special district cooperative and the county cooperatives, with the county cooperatives contributing 30% and the special district cooperative contributing 70%. In case of losses during operation, they are shared according to the proportion of funds; profits are divided at a ratio of 40% for the county cooperatives and 60% for the special district cooperative. There is also a division of labor in the scope of operations: the county cooperatives are responsible for signing contracts with grassroots cooperatives for procurement, while the special district cooperative is responsible for external promotion, such as contacting local product companies and Tianjin and Shanghai cooperative warehouses. Due to the regulations on sharing funds and distributing profits, the previous undesirable phenomena of upper and lower-level cooperatives bargaining for high prices and competing for profits in transactions have been corrected. By adopting the method of division of labor and cooperation, the operating capabilities of cooperatives at all levels have been further enhanced. At the same time, the specifications and quality of local products have also been improved. For example, before the joint operation, county cooperatives not only did not pay attention to specifications when purchasing on behalf of others, but also mixed in impurities, reducing the quality; after the joint operation, various local products could meet 70% to 75% of the specifications.

　　长治专区合作社
    通过联营畅销土产
    【本报讯】山西省长治专区合作社为开展物资交流，大力推销社员土产品，采用联营方法，把该区十六个县社的业务组织起来，从而增强了合作社业务经营的计划性。由于人力、资力的集中使用和联营，因而便于相互交换各区供需情况，在推销、收购土产上收到很大的成绩，收购部分，有的并超过原订计划。据去年九月一日至十一月十日的统计，在两个月时间内，该区共推销桃仁二十二万斤，药材（党参、五味子等）九万七千斤，花椒、大麻子、白瓜子六十余万斤。其中推销桃仁占该区总产量百分之三十八，收购党参超过原计划百分之五十八，花椒超过百分之五十五。供给了社员土布五十五万三千余匹，市布四千余匹，盐三十六万斤，煤油一万八千余斤。
    这种联营是在自愿参加原则下组成的。收购资金由专区社和县社分出，县社三成，专区社七成。在经营中遇有损失，按资金比例分担；获利按四（县社）六（专区社）分得。在经营范围上并有分工：县社负责与基层社订合同进行收购，专区社负责对外如向土产公司，津、沪合作货栈联系推销。由于分担资金，分得利润的规定，纠正了以往曾发生的上下级社在交易中讨大价，争利润的不良现象。由于采用分工合作的方法，更发挥了各级社的经营能力。同时也提高了土产的规格质量，如在未联营前，各县社代购时非但不注意规格，而且还掺有杂质，降低了质量；联营后，各种土产都能合乎百分之七十至百分之七十五的规格。
