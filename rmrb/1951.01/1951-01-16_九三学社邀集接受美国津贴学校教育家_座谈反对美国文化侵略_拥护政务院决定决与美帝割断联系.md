　　The Jiusan Society Invites Educators from American-Subsidized Schools for Discussions: Oppose American Cultural Aggression and Support the State Council's Decision to Sever Ties with American Imperialism
　　[Report from this newspaper] The Jiusan Society invited heads of higher education institutions and relief organizations receiving American subsidies from various locations in Beijing and Beijing Municipality on the 14th to hold a "Symposium on Anti-American Cultural Aggression." Those present included: Jiusan Society Chairman Xu Deheng and others, as well as Yenching University President Lu Zhiwei, Peking Union Medical College President Li Zong’en, Hangzhou University President Li Zhaohuan, Cheeloo University President Yang Dezai, Shanghai University Chairman Bao Zeqing, President Yu Rixuan, Huazhong University Vice President Huang Pu, Aurora University President Hu Wenyao, Soochow University President Yang Yongqing, Nanking University Acting President Li Fangxun, and St. John's University Dean Pan Shizi. After Jiusan Society Chairman Xu Deheng delivered a speech, Huazhong University Vice President Huang Pu said: "In recent years, those of us engaged in church school education have felt two kinds of liberation: one is the liberation of the entire mainland; the other is the State Council's decision regarding cultural education, relief organizations, and religious bodies accepting American subsidies. This decision has given us spiritual liberation. In the past, we accepted foreign subsidies, and unconsciously were utilized by them—especially American imperialism, therefore, we often felt pain. On the fifth of this month, all of us in Wuhan’s church circles held a large demonstration to oppose American cultural aggression and resolutely support this measure by the State Council." Hangzhou University President Li Zhaohuan, whose university was founded early among church schools, said: "We Guangdong people have had contact with foreigners earlier, and have suffered deeper oppression from the United States than people in any other province, so Guangdong people also deeply know the loveliness of the motherland and the preciousness of the country." He used vivid examples of Guangdong people who went abroad loving the motherland to illustrate that Guangdong people are not willing to accept American cultural aggression. He said, "My teacher—Lingnan University President Zhong Rongguang painfully said to me, 'Now we are like children who cannot walk and cannot be independent. In the future, we must take back Lingnan University and run it ourselves.'" Mr. Zhong’s hope is the same as the "Three-Self" movement we are advocating today. Under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, and amidst the high tide of the anti-American cultural aggression movement, Guangdong people can guarantee to hate America, despise America, and scorn America even more." Cheeloo University President Yang Dezai said: "Cheeloo University has a history of eighty-seven years this year, and more than 95% of its funding comes from American subsidies. The school administration is manipulated by Americans, and the pain is deepest. Therefore, we wholeheartedly support the State Council's decision and strive to realize it with all our strength." Shanghai University President Yu Rixuan said: "Our Shanghai University warmly supports the State Council's decision. After the decision was announced, Shanghai University immediately responded. In the shortest three hours, one hundred and seven staff members, excluding students, signed in support. When Shanghai held a large anti-American demonstration, all the faculty and staff of Shanghai University participated, even an old professor who was ill and unable to walk participated in the ranks by car." Soochow University President Yang Yongqing said: "Regarding the anti-American patriotic movement, I think there are two aspects: one is to strike against American aggressors politically and militarily; the other is to oppose American cultural aggression. The State Council's decision is a decision to oppose American imperialism ideologically and culturally." St. John's University Dean Pan Shizi said: "Some people say that St. John's is a fortress of American cultural aggression, and this is indeed true. But after liberation, the thoughts of St. John's students gradually progressed, and they showed great enthusiasm in the anti-American movement and played a considerable role. I believe that after St. John's University is taken over by the Chinese people, it will definitely be reborn." Aurora University President Hu Wenyao said: "We recently mobilized students to participate in military cadre schools. The French do not approve of Catholic students participating because they are afraid that these students will no longer believe in Catholicism. Of course, we have the freedom to believe in religion, but this freedom must not hinder government policies and decrees. We put the country first, the people first, not religion first. We must quickly make Aurora University a self-run university that serves the people." Nanking University Acting President said: "The State Council's decision really liberated me. Our Chinese people have stood up, and have stood up ideologically." Yenching University President Lu Zhiwei said: "I would first like to commend the students of Yenching University. In the past, whether it was the patriotic movement or the anti-Japanese national salvation movement, the students of Yenching University stood at the front. The teachers and students of Yenching University are even more enthusiastic in supporting this decision by the State Council. In the anti-American imperialist cultural aggression, I think we should clarify the so-called 'democratic individualism.' Because what we fear most is that our thinking is in the foreign style. Today, we are taking back the schools run by foreigners and running them ourselves, which is only the beginning of solving the problem. I have had relations with Americans for forty-four years, and I must admit that I have also been poisoned by them." Peking Union Medical College President Li Zong’en said: "Peking Union Medical College has a history of thirty-five years. Because of its relationship with Americans, many systems have been moved from the United States. After liberation, Peking Union Medical College has gradually been changing. Currently, we do not have a single American, but our funding comes from the United States. We are always prepared to cope with changes. Therefore, we have long been mentally and concretely prepared for the American imperialist conspiracy to threaten us by stopping subsidies. Of course, we wholeheartedly support the State Council's decision today. As people of an independent and autonomous country, we should do our best to assist the government in completing this glorious task." Fu Jen Catholic University Union Chairman Chai Degeng said: "Fu Jen was the first university to be liberated from imperialist oppression. Fu Jen has a history of twenty-five years. It was initially run by Americans, then by Germans, and finally by Americans again. After liberation, until Fu Jen was taken over by the government, we fought many times with the Americans. Therefore, after the government announced the takeover of Fu Jen, all our teachers and students expressed a warm welcome, because this is the People's Government taking back the right to educational autonomy from the hands of imperialism. After the government took over, first of all, our funding is no longer threatened. The government takes care of us everywhere. When taking over, the government was very cautious, separating imperialism and religion. The government paid special attention to the unity and development of Fu Jen, and the government's careful care and love strengthened the confidence of all teachers and students in the government and their love for the new China."
　　Finally, Chairman Xu Deheng made a summary. He said that thanks to the leadership of the great Chairman Mao and the valiant fighting of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the oppression that China has suffered politically for nearly a hundred years has been completely overthrown, and imperialist cultural aggression is also being gradually eliminated. Today, educators from all over the country are coming to Beijing to attend the meeting convened by the government to eliminate imperialist culture. This is an unprecedentedly great and glorious task. Our current stage of education is new democratic education, just as Shanghai University President Yu Rixuan said: We must draw a clear line and recognize the enemy and ourselves. Recognize the current enemy and friends. Secondly, we must promote patriotic education. The current government and country belong to our people, and we must do our best to love it and support it. This new patriotism is the people's internationalist patriotism.
　　Chairman Xu Deheng explained the following issues:
　　1. Anti-American cultural aggression is absolutely not anti-religious. This should not be misunderstood. Freedom of religious belief is stipulated in the Common Program. However, freedom of religious belief must break away from imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. In other words, it must be a friend of the people, not an enemy of the people. The enemies of the people have no freedom. The religious groups in various places have proposed the policy of "self-governance, self-support, and self-propagation," which is correct and worthy of our welcome. This "Three-Self" policy is in line with our national policy.
　　2. After breaking off relations with American imperialism, some technical problems will inevitably arise; but these problems can certainly be overcome. Look at the Northeast, look at how we have overcome the unprecedented drought over the years. Revolution originally starts from scratch, so what difficulties cannot be overcome!
　　3. In dealing with American-subsidized cultural and educational relief undertakings, both public and private interests will be taken into consideration. On the one hand, the government encourages private individuals to contribute their efforts, and on the other hand, all patriotic educators should also do their best to support the government.

　　九三学社邀集接受美国津贴学校教育家
    座谈反对美国文化侵略
    拥护政务院决定决与美帝割断联系
    【本报讯】九三学社十四日邀请各地来京以及北京市的接受美国津贴的高等学校及救济机关负责人，举行“反美文化侵略座谈会”。出席的计有：九三学社主席许德珩等及燕京大学校长陆志韦、协和医学院院长李宗恩、之江大学校长黎照寰、齐鲁大学校长杨德斋、沪江大学董事长鲍哲庆、校长余日宣、华中大学副校长黄溥、震旦大学校长胡文耀，东吴大学校长杨永清、金陵大学代理校长李方训、圣约翰大学教务长潘世兹等。九三学社许德珩主席致词后，华中大学副校长黄溥说：“年来我们从事教会学校教育事业的人感觉有两种解放：一个是全国大陆上的解放；一个是政务院关于接受美国津贴的文化教育、救济机关和宗教团体所作的决定。这个决定使我们精神上获得了解放。过去我们接受外国的津贴，不知不觉地受了他们——特别是美帝的利用，因此我们时常感到痛苦。本月五日。我们全武汉的教会同人举行了大游行，反对美帝的文化侵略，坚决拥护政务院的这个措施。”在教会学校中创办较早的之江大学的校长黎照寰说：“我们广东人和外国接触较早，受美国的压迫比任何一省的人都要深，所以广东人也深知祖国之可爱，国家之可贵。”他以到外国去的广东人热爱祖国的生动事例来说明广东人并不肯接受美国的文化侵略。他说：“我的老师——岭南大学校长钟荣光先生痛苦地对我说：“现在我们象孩子一样不能走路，不能独立，将来我们一定要把岭南大学收回自办。”钟先生的这个希望和今天我们所提倡的“三自”运动是一样的。在毛主席英明领导下，在反美文化侵略运动高涨之际，广东人更可保证做到仇美、鄙美、蔑美。”齐鲁大学校长杨德斋说：“齐大到今年已有八十七年的历史，百分之九十五以上的经费是美国津贴的，学校行政受美国人操纵，痛苦最深。因此，我们十二万分拥护政务院的决定，并以全力争取实现。”沪江大学校长余日宣说：“我们沪江大学热烈拥护政务院的决定，在决定公布之后，沪江马上响应，在最短的三小时内，除了学生，就有一百零七个职员签名拥护。上海举行抗美大游行时，沪江全体教职员都参加了，连一位有病不能步行的老教授都坐着车参加了行列。”东吴大学校长杨永清说：“关于反美爱国运动，我认为有两方面：一方面从是政治和军事上去打击美国侵略者；一方面就是反美文化侵略。政务院的这个决定就是从思想上从文化方面去反对美帝侵略的决定。”圣约翰大学教务长潘世兹说：“有人说，圣约翰是美帝文化侵略的堡垒，这话确实也不错。但在解放后，圣约翰同学的思想逐渐进步，在抗美运动中，表现很热烈，也起了相当的作用。我相信圣约翰大学由中国人民接管以后，一定是可以得到新生的。”震旦大学校长胡文耀说：“我们最近发动学生参加军事干部学校，法国人不赞成教徒学生去参加。因为他们怕这些学生不再相信天主教。自然，我们有信仰宗教的自由，但这种自由不得妨碍政府的政策和法令。我们是国家第一，人民第一，而不是宗教第一。我们要很快地使震旦大学成为自办的为人民服务的大学。”金陵大学代理校长说：“政务院的决定，真使我得到了解放。我们中国人民站起来了，而且是从思想上站起来了。”燕京大学校长陆志韦说：“我首先要表扬燕大的同学，在过去，不管是爱国运动或抗日救国运动，燕大同学都是站在前线的。政务院这一决定，燕大师生更十分热烈拥护。在反美帝文化侵略中，我认为应该廓清所谓“民主个人主义”。因为我们最怕的是思想上是外国方式的，我们今天把外国人办的学校收回自办，这只是问题的开始解决。我和美国人发生关系也有四十四年的历史，我应承认我也中了他们的毒。协和医学院院长李宗恩说：“协和”有三十五年的历史，由于它和美国人的关系，许多制度，都是从美国搬过来的。解放以后，“协和”就逐渐在蜕变中，目前，我们已没有一个美国人，但我们的经费，是从美国来的。我们随时准备应付变动。所以对于美帝以停止津贴来威胁我们的阴谋，我们早已有了精神上和具体步骤上的准备。我们今天当然竭诚拥护政务院的决定，作为一个独立自主国家的人民，我们自应以全力来协助政府完成这一光荣任务。”辅仁大学工会主席柴德赓说：“辅仁是首先从帝国主义压迫下解放出来的大学。辅仁有二十五年的历史，最初是美国人主办，中经德国人，最后又是美国人。解放以后，直到辅仁由政府接办以前，我们和美国人作了许多次的斗争。因之，政府宣布接办辅仁以后，我们全体师生都表示热烈欢迎，因为这是人民政府从帝国主义手里把教育自主权收回来。政府接办了，首先，我们经费再没有任何威胁了。政府处处照顾我们。接办时，政府非常慎重，把帝国主义和宗教分开，政府特别注意辅仁的团结和发展问题，政府的细心照顾和爱护增强了全校同人对政府的信心和对新中国的热爱。”
    最后，由许德珩主席作总结。他说，由于伟大的毛主席的领导和中国人民解放军的奋勇作战，使中国近一百年来在政治上所受的压迫都彻底推翻了，帝国主义的文化侵略也在逐步地被肃清。今天，各位教育家来京出席政府召开的会议，就是要来肃清帝国主义的文化，这是一个空前伟大而光荣的任务。我们现阶段的教育是新民主主义的教育，诚如沪江大学余日宣校长所说：我们要划清界限，认清敌我。认识现阶段的敌友。其次，我们要提倡爱国主义的教育。现在的政府和国家，是我们人民自己的，我们要用全力来爱护它，支持它。这个新爱国主义是人民的国际主义的爱国主义。
    许德珩主席对下述问题作了解释：
    一、反美文化侵略绝对不是反宗教。这不要误会。信教自由是规定在共同纲领上面的。但信教自由必定要与帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义断绝关系。换言之，必定是人民的朋友，而不是人民的敌人。人民的敌人是没有自由的。我们各地的宗教团体提出了“自治、自养、自传”的政策，这是对的，是值得我们欢迎的。这个“三自”政策符合我们国家的政策。
    二、和美帝国主义断绝了关系后，将会发生一些技术上的问题，这也是必然的；但这些问题一定也是可以克服的。看东北吧，看我们克服多少年来未有的灾荒吧。革命本来是从无到有，还有什么不可以克服的困难！
    三、在处理接受美国津贴的文教救济事业时，是会公私兼顾的，政府一方面鼓励私人拿出力量来做，另一方面，一切爱国的教育家们也要用全力来支持政府。
