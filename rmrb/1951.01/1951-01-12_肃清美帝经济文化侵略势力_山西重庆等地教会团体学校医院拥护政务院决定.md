Xinhua News Agency report: Religious groups, church schools, and hospitals in Shanxi, Suiyuan, and other provinces, as well as Wuhu, Chongqing, Chengdu, and other cities, unanimously support the State Council of the Central People's Government's decision on handling cultural, educational, and relief organizations and religious groups receiving American subsidies. Yang Mingbao, Chairman of the Shanxi Christian Association, said: The religious, cultural, educational, and other activities of American imperialism in China are all aimed at aggression and enslavement of the Chinese people. Teachers and students of Mingxian College in Taigu County, which has been controlled by American imperialism for more than 40 years, unanimously believe that the State Council's decision is a powerful measure to eliminate American aggression.

Ma Yi, Director of the Suiyuan Provincial Christian Association, called on Christians throughout the province to launch the Three-Self Patriotic Movement extensively to sever the ties between the church and American imperialism. Christians and Catholics in Guisui, Baotou, and other cities in the province also issued declarations, warmly supporting the State Council's decision.

The Wuhu Christian Association, representing more than 1,400 Christians in various churches, hospitals, and schools in the city, issued a declaration stating that the State Council's decision fully conforms to the interests of the people of the whole country, and will also more effectively promote the rapid completion of the Chinese church's renovation movement. The principals of church middle schools such as Peide, Cuiwen, and Chongzhi in the city have all issued written statements, unanimously expressing their determination to completely sever the shackles of American imperialism. These schools have also held meetings of all faculty and staff to begin preparations. Yijishan Hospital in the city, which has been controlled by American imperialism under the guise of religion for 70 years, held a staff meeting on the 2nd, setting off firecrackers and celebrating. At the meeting, more than 20 doctors and staff members accused American imperialism of its crimes. They said in unison: American imperialism's operation of hospitals in China is by no means charity, but a means to disguise its aggression. We firmly support the State Council's decision to run the people's own hospital well. A inventory committee has now been established to register hospital property, and employees have organized a picket team to protect the hospital.

Chu Huizong and Fan Guangwei, persons in charge of Chongqing Qiujing Commercial College, which was suspended by the American church before liberation for initiating reforms in school education policies and was re-established with the help of the People's Government after liberation, expressed their sincere support for the State Council's decision. Chen Zuyi, director of the life counseling group of Qiujing Middle School, said: "We must not only sever economic ties with American imperialism, but also thoroughly eliminate the influence of American imperialism on us ideologically." All church schools in Chongqing have decided to hold meetings to discuss Vice Premier Guo Moruo's report. Ren Xinjing, Deputy Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Trade Union of Chongqing Kuanren Hospital (which is run by the American Methodist Episcopal Church), said: We recognize that the so-called "charitable organizations" of American imperialism are actually opened with the blood and sweat money of the Chinese people. We support the People's Government to take over Kuanren Hospital. More than 50 representatives of Christian groups in Chongqing gathered at the Christian Social Hall on the 4th to discuss the State Council's decision and Vice Premier Guo Moruo's report. Pastor Li Muqun of the Lutheran Church said at the discussion: "American imperialism's freezing of Chinese assets in the United States is a helpless expression of American imperialism's failure to invade China. The State Council's decision is a powerful counterattack against American imperialism." Chen Chonggui, President of Chongqing Theological Seminary, said: "American imperialism uses religion as a tool to invade China. We must resolutely respond to it by implementing the Three-Self Patriotic Movement of self-government, self-support, and self-propagation."

The Chengdu Christian Study Committee, the Chengdu YWCA, and 23 other religious groups, as well as Huaxi University, West China Concord Middle School, Huamei Girls' Middle School, Gaoqi Middle School, and four other American-sponsored church schools issued declarations respectively, supporting the State Council's decision. In a joint declaration, 23 Christian groups stated: They will resolutely sever ties with American imperialism and no longer accept any subsidies from American imperialism. The declarations of the church schools stated: They will support this wise measure of the Central People's Government with practical actions, cut off ties with American imperialism from the root, and run the new democratic education well with the support of the People's Government.

In addition, pastors, elders, deacons, and church members of 13 churches including the Christian Methodist Church and the Church of God in Tangshan City, Hebei Province, held a symposium on this. At the meeting, Pastor Shen Dexiong said: The Chinese church must get rid of the control of American imperialism and resolutely implement self-government, self-support, and self-propagation. After seeing the State Council's decision, the pastor of the Christian Methodist Church in Kaifeng City, Henan Province, immediately summoned the financial management personnel of the church and rushed to make a list of property to be submitted to the People's Government for registration.

　　肃清美帝经济文化侵略势力
    山西重庆等地教会团体学校医院拥护政务院决定
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：山西、绥远等省和芜湖、重庆、成都等市的宗教团体和教会学校、医院一致拥护中央人民政府政务院关于处理接受美国津贴的文化教育、救济机关及宗教团体的方针的决定。山西省基督教联合会会长杨明葆说：美帝国主义在华的宗教、文化教育等活动，都是为了侵略和奴役中国人民。受美帝国主义控制了四十多年的太谷县铭贤学院师生一致认为：政务院的决定是清除美国侵略势力的有力措施。
    绥远省基督教联合会主任马义号召全省教徒广泛展开三自运动，割断教会与美帝国主义的联系。该省归绥、包头等市的基督教和天主教徒也纷纷发表宣言，热烈拥护政务院的决定。
    芜湖市基督教协进会代表该市各教会和医院、学校中的一千四百余基督教徒发表宣言称：政务院的决定完全符合全国人民的利益，同时也将更有力地促进中国教会革新运动的迅速完成。该市培德、萃文、崇志等教会中学的校长都发表书面谈话，一致表示要彻底斩断美帝国主义的束缚。该校等并分别举行了全校教职员会议，着手进行准备工作。被美帝国主义利用宗教名义控制了七十年的该市弋矶山医院，于二日举行了全院职工大会，燃放鞭炮，欢呼庆祝。会上，二十多个医师、职工控诉了美帝国主义的罪行。他们异口同声地说：美帝国主义在中国办医院，决不是什么慈善，而是掩饰其侵略的手段。我们坚决拥护政务院的决定，办好人民自己的医院。现该院已成立了清点委员会，登记医院财产，职工们并组织了纠察队进行护院工作。
    解放前因发起改革学校教育方针而被美国教会停办，解放后得到人民政府的帮助而复校的重庆求精商学院负责人褚汇宗、范光炜表示竭诚拥护政务院的决定。求精中学的生活辅导组主任陈祖翼说：“我们不仅要从经济上割断与美帝国主义的联系，而且要从思想上彻底肃清美帝国主义对我们的影响。”重庆市各教会学校并决定集会讨论郭沫若副总理的报告。重庆宽仁医院（该院系美国基督教卫理公会所办）职工会筹备委员会副主任委员任心镜说：我们认清了美帝国主义所谓的“慈善团体”，实际上都是剥削中国人民的血汗金钱开办的。我们拥护人民政府来接办宽仁医院。重庆各基督教团体代表五十余人于四日在基督教社交会堂集会讨论政务院的决定和郭沫若副总理的报告。路德会牧师李牧群在讨论会上说：“美帝国主义冻结中国在美国的财产，正是美帝国主义在侵略中国失败后的无可奈何的表示。政务院的决定是我们给美帝国主义的有力的回击。”重庆神学院院长陈崇桂说：“美帝国主义利用宗教作为侵略中国的工具，我们要坚决以实行自治、自养、自传的革新运动来回答它。”
    成都市基督教徒学习委员会、成都市基督教女青年会等二十三个宗教团体和华西大学、华西协和中学、华美女中、高琦中学等四个美国主办的教会学校分别发表宣言，拥护政务院的决定。二十三个基督教团体在联合宣言中表示：他们要坚决割断与美帝国主义的联系，不再接受美帝国主义的任何津贴。教会学校的宣言则表示：要以实际行动支持中央人民政府这一贤明措施，从根斩断与美帝国主义的联系，在人民政府的支持下，办好新民主主义教育”。
    此外，河北唐山市基督教循道公会、神召会等十三个教会的牧师、长老、执事和教徒，曾为此举行座谈会。会上，牧师沈德雄说：中国的教会必须摆脱美帝国主义的控制，坚决实行自治、自养、自传。河南开封市基督教循理会牧师看到政务院的决定后，即自动召集该会管理财政人员，赶造财产清册呈送人民政府登记。
