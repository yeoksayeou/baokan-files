To the Editor:

　　On the 4th of this month, Line Foreman Li Chuanji of the Engineering Department and I went to Guye to inspect the switches and lines. We found a lot of ice frozen on the North Six and North Seven tracks of the locomotive depot's departure line, as well as the A-Inspection line inside the depot. In the most serious places, the ice had exceeded the rail surface, and two switches were frozen so that they could not be moved, which is very dangerous for train operation. On the A-Inspection line, several workers were digging at the frozen ice, but they just casually chipped at it and considered it done. I inspected it and found that there was still a twelve-millimeter gap inside the point rail from the base rail top. I asked the workers who move the switches at the locomotive depot: "Can trains run like this?" He replied: "It doesn't matter, trains rarely come here." This statement is obviously wrong. Accidents often occur due to carelessness. In the patriotic emulation campaign to completely eliminate accidents, the glorious railway workers should not have this kind of paralyzing thought.

　　According to our understanding, the reason for the frozen ice on the tracks is due to locomotives randomly releasing water and steam. In winter, the ground is frozen and water does not easily permeate, so the more water is released, the higher the ice freezes, to the point where it submerges the steel rails. This not only seriously threatens the safety of train operation, but also damages the steel rails and sleepers. At the same time, the locomotive's steam release has damaged the south wall of the locomotive depot, and it is feared that it will collapse when the rainy season comes. This phenomenon of harming the people's construction cause cannot be allowed to continue, and we request that the relevant departments quickly correct it.

### 古冶机务段出库线路结了厚冰

　　古冶机务段出库
    线路结了厚冰编辑同志：
    本月四日，我和工务处线路科长李传基到古冶检查道岔和线路，发现机务段出库线北六、北七道，及机务段内甲检库线都冻了好多的冰，最严重的地方已超过轨面，两条道岔也被冻得搬不了道，这样对行车是非常危险的。在甲检库线上有几个工友正在刨冻冰，粗枝大叶地刨了刨就算了。我检查了一下，尖轨距基轨顶里面尚有十二公厘空隙。我问机务段搬道的工友：“这样走得了车吗？”他回答说：“没关系，车轻易不上这儿来。”这种说法显然是不对的。发生事故往往是由于粗心大意所造成，在彻底消灭事故的爱国主义竞赛运动中，光荣的铁路员工是不应该有这种麻痹思想的。
    关于轨道冻冰的原因，据了解是由于机车的随便放水放汽。冬天地冻不易渗透水，因此越放越冻得高，以致将钢轨冻没。这样不仅严重地威胁着行车的安全，且对钢轨、枕木都有损害。同时由于机车的放汽，把机务段南墙都吹坏了，雨季一到恐怕就有倒塌的危险。这种危害人民建设事业的现象，实在不能容许再继续下去，要求有关部门能迅速予以纠正。
