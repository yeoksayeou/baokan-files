　　[Report from this newspaper] The patriotic parade rally against American aggression and opposing the arming of Japan, held in Beijing on the 28th by more than 40,000 women, sent telegrams to the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army to pay tribute, sent telegrams to all Asian women and Japanese women calling for joint opposition to American aggression and opposing the arming of Japan, and sent a telegram warning the Japanese Yoshida government.
    The telegram to the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army stated: "You are bravely advancing in the freezing cold! Your victory has defended the independence of the Korean people and protected the security of China and Asia. Your heroic battles have terrified those man-eating and blood-drinking warmongers. Dear comrades! What you are engaged in is precisely an earth-shattering and great just war! Over the past few months, we have strengthened our study of current affairs and cared about your victory; we have sent countless letters of comfort and condolence bags, filled with our infinite care and respect for you. In the upsurge of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, many mothers and wives have sent their loved ones to national defense construction work and to the front lines of the war to resist U.S. aggression and defend our homes and country. Because we deeply realize that to achieve peace, we must use all our strength to fight for peace. The struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea is a great and just cause related to the peace and security of all mankind. Today, 40,000 women in Beijing are holding a demonstration here, we are cheering the victory on the front lines, and unanimously vow to resolutely support you. Forward! Heroic soldiers, with the support of the people of the world, you will surely continue to achieve greater victories and drive the enemy into the sea!"
    The telegram to all Asian sisters who love peace and freedom stated: "Thanks to the heroic battles of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, American imperialism has suffered an unprecedented and severe blow on the Korean battlefield, and the people of the world are rejoicing for this great victory. However, the American imperialists, as foolish as pigs, have not learned a lesson from this defeat. They are clamoring for a separate peace treaty with Japan, actively arming Japan, and attempting to make Japan a base for their attack on Asia and to make the Japanese people cannon fodder for their expanded war of aggression. We, the Asian people who have suffered many disasters, have learned from bloody lessons how to defend ourselves and strike at the enemy. We sincerely extend our hands to you, dear sisters: let us unite closely under the banner of opposing American aggression, opposing the arming of Japan, and defending world peace, and bravely move forward! Our cause is just, and victory will surely belong to the people who fight for justice."
    The telegram to Japanese women stated: "The brutal American imperialists do not want anyone to enjoy a peaceful and happy life. They have torn up sacred international agreements, invaded Korea and occupied Taiwan, and are even more frantically arming Japan, releasing war criminals who have slaughtered millions of Chinese people, and restoring Japanese fascist forces, attempting to use your Japan as a base for aggression against Asia and to use you, the Japanese people, as cannon fodder for their war of aggression. Dear Japanese sisters! During the Japanese fascist warlords' war of aggression against our China, our Chinese people suffered unprecedentedly cruel torment at their hands, and you, the Japanese people, also suffered significant sacrifices. Your husbands and sons were either killed, injured, or went missing on the battlefield. The pain inflicted on us by the Japanese fascist warlords has also been inflicted on you. We believe that you, like us, are extremely opposed to wars of aggression and opposed to the rearmament of Japan. Now let us be closely linked together to fight against the aggression of the American imperialists, to shatter all the conspiracies of the American imperialists, and to defend the safety of the people of China and Japan and world peace!"
    The warning telegram to the Yoshida government in Tokyo stated: "We Chinese people will never forget the aggressive atrocities of Japanese imperialism. During the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan, countless of our parents, brothers, and sisters were massacred and raped by the Japanese fascist army, and countless cities, villages, factories, and schools were burned and destroyed by the Japanese fascist army and turned into ruins. Our factories and schools are being restored, and we are using our own hard work to heal the wounds and create conditions for a safe and happy life in the future. But you are colluding with American imperialism again, restoring your armaments, restoring your military industry, making Japan a military base for American aggression against China and aggression against Asia, and making the Japanese people cannon fodder for American wars of aggression. This illegal act by American imperialism, which threatens China's security and Far Eastern peace, will inevitably arouse resolute opposition and forceful retaliation from the Chinese people, including the Japanese people, the Asian people, and the people of the world. In addition to lodging a serious protest with American imperialism, we solemnly warn you: all your conspiracies are in vain. The strength of the world peace camp is unprecedentedly strong, and the crushing defeat of American imperialism in the war of aggression against Korea has proved that its doomsday is near. The Chinese people and the people of the world have the full strength, confidence, and courage to shatter the American aggression plan. American imperialism is bound to suffer a complete and disgraceful defeat, and it has already been decisively defeated. If you are willing to serve as an instrument of aggression for American imperialism and reorganize your armed forces, you will not escape the just sanctions of the Chinese people, the Japanese people, and the people of the world!"

　　首都妇女爱国游行示威大会通电
    向中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军致敬
    号召全亚洲和日本姊妹共同反对美国侵略
    并电日本吉田反动政府提出严正警告
    【本报讯】二十八日在北京四万余妇女举行的抗美援朝、反对武装日本爱国游行大会曾电中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军致敬，电全亚洲妇女和日本妇女号召共同反对美国侵略，反对武装日本，并致电警告日本吉田政府。
    向中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军致敬电称：“你们正在冰天雪地里奋勇前进！你们的胜利保卫了朝鲜人民的独立，保卫了中国和亚洲的安全。你们的英勇战斗使那些吃人喝血的战争贩子们惊慌发抖。亲爱的同志们！你们所进行的正是惊天动地的伟大的正义的战争！几个月来，我们加强了时事学习，关心着你们的胜利；我们寄出了无数的慰问信慰劳袋，那里面，装满了我们对你们无限的关怀和敬意。在抗美援朝的热潮中，许多母亲和妻子把她们的亲人送到国防建设工作中去，送到抗美援朝保家卫国的战争前线去。因为我们深切地认识，要得到和平，就要用一切力量争取和平。抗美援朝的斗争，正是关系全人类和平与安全的伟大的正义事业。今天，我们北京的四万妇女在这儿举行示威游行，我们欢呼着前线的胜利，一致宣誓坚决的支援你们。前进吧！英勇的战士们，在全世界人民的支援下，你们一定会继续获得更大的胜利，把敌人赶下海去！”
    致全亚洲爱好和平和自由的姊妹们的电文称：“由于中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军的英勇战斗，美帝国主义在朝鲜战场上遭到了空前未有的严重打击，全世界人民都为这个伟大的胜利而欢欣鼓舞。但是愚蠢如猪的美帝国主义者并没有在这个失败中得到教训，它正在叫嚣单独对日媾和，积极武装日本，企图使日本成为他进攻亚洲的基地，使日本人民成为他扩大侵略战争的炮灰。我们久经灾难的亚洲人民，已经从血腥的教训中学会了怎样来保卫自己和打击敌人。我们热诚地向你们伸出手来，亲爱的姊妹们：让我们在反对美国侵略、反对武装日本、保卫世界和平的旗帜下亲密团结，勇敢前进吧！我们的事业是正义的，胜利必定属于为正义而斗争的人民。”
    致日本妇女电称：“残暴的美帝国主义者不愿任何人享受和平幸福的生活，它撕碎了神圣的国际协定，侵略朝鲜与侵占台湾，更疯狂地武装日本，释放曾经屠杀过数百万中国人民的战犯，恢复日本法西斯势力，企图以你们日本作为侵略亚洲的基地，利用你们日本人民充当它进行侵略战争的炮灰。亲爱的日本姐妹们！在日本法西斯军阀向我们中国进行侵略战争期间，我们中国人民曾遭受他们旷古未有的残酷荼毒，而你们日本人民也同样遭受了重大的牺牲。你们的丈夫和儿子，在战场上不是死伤就是失踪。日本法西斯军阀给我们的痛苦也同样加在你们的身上了。我们相信你们一定和我们一样，是极端反对侵略战争、反对重新武装日本的。现在让我们紧紧地连在一起，为反对美帝国主义者的侵略，粉碎美帝国主义的一切阴谋，为保卫中日两国人民的自身安全与全世界的和平而奋斗吧！”
    致东京吉田政府的警告电中称：“我们中国人民永远忘不掉日本帝国主义的侵略兽行。在八年抗日战争中，我们无数的父母、兄弟、姐妹被日本法西斯军队残杀、奸淫，无数的城市、乡村、工厂、学校被日本法西斯军队焚毁破坏变成了废墟。我们的工厂、学校正在恢复，我们正以自己的勤劳恢复创伤，为未来的安全、幸福的生活创造条件。可是你们又和美帝国主义勾结又在恢复你们的武装，恢复你们的军事工业，使日本成为美国侵略中国侵略亚洲的军事基地，使日本人民成为美国进行侵略战争的炮灰。美帝国主义这种威胁中国安全和远东和平的非法行为，必将引起中国人民、包括日本人民在内的亚洲人民和全世界人民坚决反对与有力的回击。我们除开向美帝国主义严重抗议之外，并严正地警告你们：你们的种种阴谋，都是枉费心机，全世界和平阵营的力量空前强大，美帝国主义在侵朝战争中的惨败已经证明它的末日快到了。中国人民与全世界人民完全有力量、有信心、有勇气粉碎美国的侵略计划，美帝国主义必然要遭到全盘的可耻的失败，而且已经决定地失败了。你们如果甘作美帝国主义的侵略工具，重新组织武装也将难逃中国人民、日本人民和全世界人民的正义制裁！”
