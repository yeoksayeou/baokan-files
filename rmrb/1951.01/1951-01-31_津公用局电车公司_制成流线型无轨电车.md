Tianjin Public Utility Bureau Tram Company
    Manufactures Streamlined Trolleybus

    [This newspaper] Tianjin Municipal People's Government Public Utility Bureau Tram Company, began trial production of a streamlined trolleybus in November 1949. After a year of trial production, it was finally completed at the end of November 1950 and officially test-driven on the streets of Tianjin on December 12, 1950. The test results showed that the vehicle ran smoothly, and the motor and other components inside the car were running well. The manufacturing cost of this car is two-thirds cheaper than buying from foreign countries.

    The exterior of this new car is entirely made of iron sheet, imitating the structure of the "ZIS-154" bus. The interior is very comfortable, with leather soft seats, which can seat 26 people. With standing passengers, it can accommodate 46 people. The entire car weighs 4.5 tons, and about 6 tons with passengers, which is only slightly more than half the weight of a typical tram. This streamlined trolleybus has the following advantages: 1. It does not need to lay tracks, saving investment; 2. The power cost is lower than that of a bus; 3. There is no noisy sound, suitable for urban transportation; 4. It avoids the complicated engineering of railway level crossings, and because it occupies less area than trams, it reduces the traffic capacity of the streets; 5. It does not need to destroy and rebuild the existing road surface.

    This new car will run on the line from Jiefang Bridge to Xiaosunzhuang in Tianjin's Fifth District in April of this year. (Tianjin Public Utility Bureau Telegraph Station) (Attached picture)

　　津公用局电车公司
    制成流线型无轨电车
    【本报讯】天津市人民政府公用局电车公司，自一九四九年十一月起开始着手试作的流线型无轨电车，经过一年的试作过程，终于在一九五○年十一月底制作完成，于一九五○年十二月十二日在天津的市街上正式试车。试车结果，行车平稳，车内电动机等各项机件运转良好。该车制造成本，较向外国购买便宜三分之二。
    这辆新车外部完全用铁皮制成，是模仿公共汽车“吉斯一五四”式构造的。车内很舒适，有皮面软坐椅，可以坐二十六个人，如加上站的乘客可容四十六人，全车共重四吨半，加上乘客约六吨多，仅为一般有轨电车重的二分之一强。这一流线型的无轨电车有下述优点：一、不需要铺设路轨，节省投资；二、动力成本比公共汽车低廉；三、没有嘈杂的声响，适合都市交通；四、避免了铁路平交道的复杂工程，并因比有轨电车所占面积较小，减低了街道的交通容量；五、不用把已有的路面破坏重建。
    这辆新车将于今年四月在天津五区自解放桥到小孙庄一线上行驶。（津公用局电讯站）（附图片）
