　　Celebrating the Liberation of Seoul

　　Seoul, the capital of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, was liberated on the 4th by the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. This largest city in Korea has returned to the hands of the heroic Korean people after three months of darkness and misery. This is a great victory for the Korean people, a great victory for the Chinese people, and a great victory for peace-loving people all over the world.

　　Seoul is the most important strategic city in Korea. Before the outbreak of the Korean War, in its early stages, and after the surprise attack on Incheon by the American invading army on September 15th, Seoul had twice been used by the American invading army as a command post for the invasion of Korea. US imperialism regarded reoccupying Seoul as the key to determining victory or defeat in the Korean War. Therefore, after the US military occupied Seoul on September 30th, US imperialism frantically celebrated its victory. MacArthur demanded the "unconditional surrender" of the Korean People's Army on October 1st. On September 30th, Austin, the US representative to the United Nations, demanded that the "United Nations" erect a "monument" to the "great achievement" of occupying Seoul. Truman also greatly praised MacArthur's "brilliant achievements" on October 17th. He believed that "the power of the Korean Communists to conduct effective resistance will soon be over." But now Seoul has returned to the hands of the Korean people. The re-liberation of Seoul has deprived the United States of its strategic hub in Korea.

　　During the three months of American occupation of Seoul, Seoul was the most miserable hell in the world. The American army and its running dog, Syngman Rhee, turned this city of about 1.5 million people into a huge slaughterhouse. Tens of thousands of Korean people in Seoul were arbitrarily massacred in batches, and pregnant women and children were not spared. Regarding the massacres of the people of Seoul during the three months, according to the obviously untruthful announcement of the Syngman Rhee puppet government alone, from October 1st to December 19th, roughly two and a half months, the "Seoul District Court" alone had "processed 9,330 cases" concerning so-called "Communist collaborators". Among them, "3,900 people have been sentenced to death." This figure does not include the "sentences of military tribunals," which killed even more people. Of course, the massacre was not limited to Seoul alone; wherever the US military and its running dogs controlled, massacres occurred everywhere. The brutality of the US military and its running dogs has made it impossible for the Anglo-American reactionary news agencies to cover up these facts. Murder, arson, rape, and plunder—all the most despicable and barbaric atrocities—have become the daily activities of the American army in Korea. The American army is implementing a policy of destroying all cities, villages, factories, schools, and hospitals in Korea. This is the most barbaric army in human history; only the fascist armies of Germany and Japan have degenerated to such a degree. Therefore, the Korean War is a war between humanity and bestiality, a war between justice and barbarism. The liberation of Seoul not only allows the suffering people of Seoul to regain human freedom but also allows most of the Korean people to be liberated in the near future. Driving the American beasts out of Seoul is a huge encouragement to the people of the world.

　　The American military's failure in Seoul proves that the American army in Korea has completely failed. After the disastrous defeat of MacArthur's two "general offensives" on the eastern and western fronts of northern Korea, US imperialism is still unwilling to withdraw from Korea. But America's "defense plan" in Korea has failed again and again like its offensive plans. The most important mistake of the American invaders is that they have not seen, nor are they willing to see, that the morale of the American army has collapsed. This decadent morale has been reflected in the most reactionary representatives of the United States. Hoover's speech on December 20th advocating withdrawal from the Eurasian continent and seizure of the two oceans reflected this sentiment, and Dulles' New Year's speech on December 29th also reflected this sentiment. Dulles was an active instigator and initiator of the war of aggression against Korea, but after half a year of war, he was full of pessimism and despair. He openly admitted that the current "major problem" of US imperialism is "whether Western civilization has become so old that it has to die and give way to Marx's communism... to produce younger, more energetic... societies"? He confessed that the current struggle between the camp of peace and democracy and the camp of imperialism is a confrontation between "young and strong" and "old and decaying," a confrontation between "universal belief" and "isolation." Acheson, in his New Year's message, also had to publicly admit that last year was their "dark year." But even darker times are only beginning for US imperialism. At a time when the reactionary group of US imperialism, from top to bottom, has fallen into pessimism, despair, and disintegration, the failure of US imperialism, starting in Korea, is irreversible.

　　The liberation of Seoul once again proves the strength of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army. The absolutely superior air force, navy, tanks, and artillery of the United States have proven powerless in the face of the great Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army, both in offensive and defensive battles. The Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army have today shown the world that they are powerful forces for peace. They are fully capable of annihilating and driving out the American invading army in Korea and restoring peace to Korea. The reason why the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army can defeat the American invading army, "armed to the teeth," in Korea is mainly because they are fighting for justice and humanity, for patriotism and internationalism, for the annihilation of the American beasts, for sparing the Korean and Chinese people from massacre, for the safety of Korean and Chinese women and children, and for avenging the innocent victims. Therefore, wherever they go, they rescue the dying and heal the wounded, restore towns and villages, and restore the peaceful life of the Korean people. Their great actions have been warmly welcomed by the Korean people. The great warriors bring light, warmth, and the joy of victory to the Korean people.

　　Glorious Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteer Army, for the independence and freedom of Korea, for the security of China and the East, advance more courageously! All the people of Korea, all of China, and all the people of the world are proud of your victory and cheer for your victory. Advance! Advance to Daejeon! Advance to Daegu! Advance to Busan! Drive the American invading army, which refuses to withdraw from Korea, into the sea!

### 祝汉城光复

　　祝汉城光复
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国首都汉城于四日被朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军光复。这座朝鲜最大的城市，经过三个月黑暗悲惨的日子，又重新回到英勇的朝鲜人民手中。这是朝鲜人民的伟大胜利，是中国人民的伟大的胜利，也是全世界爱和平的人民的伟大胜利。
    汉城是朝鲜最重要的战略城市。在朝鲜战争爆发以前和战争的初期，以及九月十五日美国侵略军偷袭仁川以后，汉城曾两次被美国侵略军作为侵略朝鲜的司令台。美帝国主义把重占汉城，看作朝鲜战争中决定胜败的关键。因此，九月三十日，美军侵占汉城之后，美帝国主义曾经发狂地庆祝自己的胜利。麦克阿瑟于十月一日即要求朝鲜人民军“无条件投降”。美国驻联合国代表奥斯汀在九月三十日即要求“联合国”对于侵占汉城的“伟绩”，要建立“纪念碑”。杜鲁门在十月十七日也大大称赞麦克阿瑟的“辉煌成就”。他认为“朝鲜共产党进行有效抵抗的力量，不久就会完结了。”但是，现在汉城又回到朝鲜人民手中了。汉城再度解放，使美国在朝鲜失去了战略的中枢。
    美军重占汉城的三个月期间，汉城曾是世界上一个最悲惨的地狱。美军和它的走狗李承晚把这一个约一百五十万人口的城市，变为巨大的屠场。成千成万的朝鲜人民在汉城成批地被任意屠杀，孕妇和儿童也不能幸免。三个月来汉城人民被屠杀的情况，仅据李承晚伪政府的显然不真实的宣布，十月一日到十二月十九日，大致两个半月中，单单“汉城地方法院”已“处理了九千三百三十件”关于所谓“共产党合作分子”的案件。其中，“三千九百人已被判处死刑”。这个数字还不包括杀人更多的所谓“军事法庭的判决”在内。屠杀当然并不仅在汉城一地，美军及其走狗所控制的地方，随处都发生大批屠杀的事件。美军及其走狗的残暴程度，已使英美反动新闻机关无法掩盖这些事实。杀人、放火、奸淫、掳掠，一切最卑鄙的、最野蛮的兽行，已成为美国军队在朝鲜的日常活动。美国军队在朝鲜执行着毁灭一切城市、乡村、工厂、学校、医院的方针，这是人类历史上最野蛮的军队，历史上只有德国和日本的法西斯军队才堕落到这样的程度。因此，朝鲜战争是人道和兽道的战争，是正义和野蛮的战争。汉城的解放，不仅使苦难深重的汉城人民重获人类的自由，而且使大部分的朝鲜人民，在不久的将来，亦可以获得解放。把美国野兽赶出汉城，对于全世界人民是一个巨大的鼓舞。
    美军在汉城的失败，证明在朝鲜的美国军队是彻底地失败了。在麦克阿瑟所指挥的两次“总攻势”在朝鲜北部的东西两个战场惨败之后，美帝国主义仍然不愿退出朝鲜。但是美国在朝鲜的“防御计划”也和它的进攻计划一样地再三失败。美国侵略者最主要的错误，是他们没有看到、也不肯看到美国军队的士气已经瓦解了。这种颓败的士气，已反映到美国最反动的代表人物的身上。去年十二月二十日胡佛主张退出欧亚大陆，侵占两洋的演说，反映了这种情绪，十二月二十九日杜勒斯的新年演说，也反映了这种情绪。杜勒斯是侵朝战争的积极指使者和发动者，但是经过半年战争之后，他已经充满悲观失望的情绪。他公开承认：美国帝国主义现在的“重大问题”，是“西方文明是不是已变得这样老朽，以致不得不死去，而让位于马克思的共产主义………产生出来更年青的、精力充沛的……社会”？他供认，现在和平民主阵营与帝国主义阵营的斗争，是“少壮”与“老朽”的对抗，是“普遍信仰”与“孤立”的对抗。艾奇逊在其新年文告中，也不得不公开承认去年是他们“黑暗的一年”。但是，更黑暗的年代，对于美帝国主义来说，才在开始。在美帝国主义反动集团上上下下已陷于悲观失望分崩离析的时候，美帝国主义从朝鲜开始的失败，是无可挽回的了。
    汉城的光复，又一次证明中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军的强大。美国绝对优势的空军、海军、坦克和大炮，在伟大的中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军前面，无论在进攻战和防御战中，都已证明无能为力。中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军今天已向全世界表明了自己是强大的和平力量。他们完全有力量消灭与赶走美国在朝鲜的侵略军，恢复朝鲜的和平。中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军之所以在朝鲜能战胜“武装到牙齿”的美国侵略军，主要就因为他们是为正义人道而战，为爱国主义和国际主义而战，为消灭美国野兽而战，为使朝鲜和中国人民免于屠杀而战，为朝鲜和中国妇女和儿童的安全而战，为无辜死难者复仇而战。因而他们所到之地，救死扶伤，恢复城镇和乡村，恢复朝鲜人民的和平生活。他们的伟大行动，已受到朝鲜人民的热烈欢迎。伟大的战士们给朝鲜人民带来光明、温暖、和胜利的欢欣。
    光荣的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军，为了朝鲜的独立自由，为了中国和东方的安全，更英勇地前进吧！全朝鲜、全中国和全世界人民都以你们的胜利而骄傲，都为你们的胜利而欢呼。前进！向大田前进！向大邱前进！向釜山前进！把不肯撤出朝鲜的美国侵略军赶下海去！
