Xinhua News Agency, January 13th: People across the country continue to solemnly protest the illegal verdict of the US-Japan reactionaries in the "Matsukawa Incident." The statement issued by the Shenyang Municipal Federation of Trade Unions reads: "The working class worldwide shares common interests and is closely linked. The 200,000 workers in Shenyang cannot tolerate the atrocities of US imperialism and the Yoshida government in persecuting the Japanese working class. We resolutely protest the atrocities of the US-Japan reactionaries and demand the immediate release of all those arrested." All workers and technical personnel of the Telecommunications Department of the Northeast Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Railways also issued a statement expressing their protest. All employees of the Qingdao Railway, Textile, Hardware, Municipal, and Light Industry Trade Unions issued a letter of protest amidst great indignation, demanding the revocation of the original sentence and the immediate release of Suzuki Shin and 19 other arrestees. The trade unions of Sifang Railway Rolling Stock Plant and the textile industry stated in their protest letters: We cannot sit idly by while the US-Japan reactionaries persecute our Japanese worker brothers. In the future, we must more actively help our Japanese worker brothers to liberate themselves from the darkness. The Nanjing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions pointed out in its letter of protest: The illegal verdict of the US-Japan reactionaries in the "Matsukawa Incident" completely violates the Potsdam Proclamation and the Far Eastern Commission's basic policy towards Japan after its surrender. The Nanjing working class cannot tolerate this and demands the immediate and unconditional revocation of the illegal verdict in the "Matsukawa Incident" and the release of Suzuki Shin and 19 other patriotic individuals. More than 4,000 employees of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway's Nanjing District held discussions on the "Matsukawa Incident." Wang Ju-ru, a veteran worker at the Nanjing Inspection Section, said: Workers of the world are one family. Persecution of Japanese workers is persecution of Chinese workers. We must fight for the complete freedom of Suzuki Shin and 19 other persecuted patriots. Cai Yunxiang, a third-class meritorious worker at the Nanjing Locomotive Depot, said: We must intensify production to support the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army in resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, and thoroughly eliminate the US aggressors with practical actions to support the struggle of the Japanese people. More than a thousand workers in Guihua held a rally to support the anti-persecution struggle of Japanese worker brothers, expressing infinite anger at the illegal verdict of the US-Japan reactionaries and demanding the immediate release of those arrested. The 442 representatives of all circles in Pingyuan Province who were attending the People's Representative Conference sent a telegram of protest in the name of the conference on the 11th of this month. The telegram pointed out that this despicable means of the US-Japan reactionaries is nothing more than "a rehash of the Nazi Reichstag fire, which cannot deceive the people of the world."
