Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, January 23rd: In more than six thousand villages in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces of the East China region that have victoriously completed land reform, peasants are celebrating the return of land with unparalleled joy and actively preparing for spring production. In Xindeng County, Zhejiang Province, more than 53,000 liberated peasants held grand celebration meetings around the New Year. In many rural areas of Jiangsu and Anhui provinces, lanterns and colored streamers were hung, and peasants, some leading their newly distributed cattle, others carrying farm tools, joyfully sang and danced their own songs and dances. Some elderly people with white hair also dressed in festive attire and participated in the Yangko dance. The joyful atmosphere of the liberated peasants is permeating every village after land reform.

These peasants who have newly acquired land all have their own production plans. According to these plans, they are busily engaged in accumulating fertilizer, repairing ponds, and adding livestock and farm tools to prepare for the upcoming spring plowing. In Jiaxing, Jiashan, and Pinghu counties of Zhejiang Province, more than 1,840 head of cattle have been purchased since winter. Many farmers, fearing insufficient fertilizer, are taking advantage of the time before the busy farming season to collect firewood and sell vegetables in exchange for soybean cake, lime, and other fertilizers. In Yinwang Village, Jiangdu County, northern Jiangsu, all 123 households in the village have purchased large quantities of soybean cake. The amount of soybean cake applied to spring crops in the village is more than double that before land reform. In the past, only eight households applied six pieces of soybean cake per mu, and 53 households cultivated and planted without any fertilizer. Now, 94 households apply eight to ten pieces of soybean cake per mu, and the remaining 29 households apply at least three to five pieces. In the new countryside, idle and lazy people are gradually decreasing. Chen Qifa, a notorious lazy man in Yushan Village, Xuancheng County, southern Anhui, had been wandering for fourteen years, and his wife and children were chronically underfed. After being allocated eight and a half mu of land this time, he became very diligent, going out early and returning late to sell his labor. He used the money he earned to buy seeds and fertilizer, and now he has sown five and a half mu of land.

In the past, the deserted temples and nunneries have now become lively places for farmers to gather and study. Almost every village has established winter schools and literacy classes. Peasants have raised their awareness through the land reform movement and study, and have torn down the statues of Buddha and replaced them with portraits of Chairman Mao. Large numbers of peasants have withdrawn from superstitious sects and joined the peasants' associations. The peasants' association in Jiangdu County, northern Jiangsu, has now grown to 220,000 members, and 30,000 young people have joined the militia.

　　苏、浙、皖等地翻身农民
    欢庆土地还家积极准备大生产
    【新华社上海二十三日电】华东区江苏、浙江、安徽等地，胜利完成土地改革的六千多个乡村中，农民们正以无比的欢欣，庆祝土地回家，和积极准备春季大生产。浙江省新登县，全县五万三千多翻身农民，在新年前后，都分别举行了隆重的庆祝大会。江苏、安徽两省，许多农村中都张灯结彩，农民们有的牵着分得的耕牛，有的扛着农具，欢欣地演唱着自己编出来的歌舞，一些白发苍苍的老人也披红挂绿，参加扭秧歌。翻身后农民们的欢乐气氛正洋溢在每一个土地改革后的村庄。
    这些新分得土地的农民，都有自己的生产计划，按照这些计划，他们正忙碌地进行积肥、修塘、添买牲口和农具，以迎接即将到来的春耕。浙江省嘉兴、嘉善、平湖三县，入冬以来，已买进耕牛一千八百四十多头。许多农具因怕肥料不足，都趁农忙未开以前，拾柴、贩菜，以换取豆饼、石灰等肥料。苏北江都县殷王村，全村一百二十三户，都买进了大批豆饼，该村春季农作物垩豆饼的数量，比土地改革以前超过一倍以上，往年每亩垩六片饼的只有八户，有五十三户是白耕白种，现在每亩垩饼八片到十片的就有九十四户之多，其余二十九户最少也要垩饼三片到五片。新的农村中，游手好闲的懒汉也渐渐减少了。皖南宣城县玉山村，有名的懒汉陈启发，游荡了十四年，孩子老婆终年不得温饱，这次分得八亩半田后，改变的很勤俭，起早带晚出去卖短工，赚回的钱买种籽和肥料，现在他有五亩半地已下种。
    过去冷冷落落的庙宇庵堂，如今也已成了农民集会、学习的热闹场所。差不多村村都办了冬学和识字班，农民们在土地改革运动和学习中提高了觉悟，纷纷撕毁菩萨像，换上毛主席像。大批农民退出迷信的会门，参加了农民协会。苏北江都县农民协会现已发展到二十二万人，且有三万青年参加民兵。
