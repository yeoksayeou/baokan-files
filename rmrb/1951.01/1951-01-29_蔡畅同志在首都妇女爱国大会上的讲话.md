Comrades, dear sisters from all walks of life in the capital:

　　Today's patriotic demonstration and parade by women in the capital against U.S. aggression and aid to Korea and against the United States rearming Japan is of great significance and will have a great impact among women compatriots across the country.

　　The movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to defend our homes and country, launched on a voluntary basis by the people of the whole country, including our women, has achieved great success in the past three months. The Chinese People's Volunteers resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, fighting side by side with the Korean People's Army, have annihilated more than 60,000 American aggressor troops and Syngman Rhee's puppet troops, causing a decisive defeat to the American armed aggression in Korea.

　　For more than three months, Chinese women and the Chinese people have enthusiastically launched activities to support the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, as well as various other patriotic activities, and have launched current affairs study and propaganda on resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. Many women have organized volunteer ambulance teams and battlefield service teams to work on the front lines in Korea. Many young female students have joined military cadre schools. Everywhere, thousands upon thousands of women are sending their husbands and children to join the Volunteers and attend military cadre schools. Female workers everywhere are enthusiastically joining the patriotic production emulation campaign. Rural women and other women compatriots from all walks of life are enthusiastically making military shoes and cotton-padded clothes for the Volunteers, as well as writing letters, making comfort bags, donating money, and donating supplies to comfort the Volunteers. In order to raise their political awareness, women all over the country are enthusiastically participating in the current affairs study of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. Moreover, in order to express the determination of Chinese women to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, women from all walks of life in Hangzhou, Wuhan, Xuzhou, and other places have held demonstrations and parades. All these achievements made by Chinese women and the Chinese people should be celebrated and carried forward.

　　However, the U.S. imperialists have not abandoned their plans for aggression. On the contrary, even now, the U.S. imperialists are still insisting on invading our territory, the province of Taiwan, still insisting on invading our neighbor, Korea, and are stepping up their conspiracy to conclude a separate peace treaty with Japan and rearm Japan. We Chinese women and the Chinese people absolutely cannot tolerate this arrogant and despicable plan of U.S. imperialism for Japan, nor can the people of all Asia and Japan tolerate it.

　　Dear sisters! The Japanese aggressors have invaded our country for as long as fifty years, killing, setting fires, raping, and plundering in our country. How many compatriots have died under the swords of the Japanese aggressors? Can we forget this deep hatred?

　　Can we allow the U.S. imperialists to write off the victory we won through eight years of bloody battle with one stroke? No, never! Women across the country and compatriots across the country must, while assisting the Korean people, launch a resolute movement against the U.S. separate peace treaty with Japan and the rearming of Japan, and work together with the people of the East and the people of Japan to strive for the signing of a comprehensive and just peace treaty with Japan.

　　We should tell Japanese women that we Chinese women stand with you to jointly oppose U.S. imperialism. The U.S. imperialist plan to rearm Japan is a plan to destroy Japan and the Japanese people. We should join hands to oppose this heinous plan.

　　We should tell the women of the Philippines, New Zealand, Australia, Indonesia, Malaya, Vietnam, Thailand, Burma, and India that we must unite to smash the U.S. imperialist heinous plan to rearm Japan and threaten Asian peace.

　　In addition, at present, we should also work together with the people of the whole country to carry out the following specific tasks:

　　First, we must respond to the call of the China Peace Committee and the appeal of the Korean Democratic Women's League by writing letters and donating money and goods to comfort the Chinese and Korean people's fighters and to relieve Korean refugees.

　　Second, we must launch a movement to respect and give preferential treatment to the families of revolutionary soldiers during the Spring Festival, pay tribute to the families of the glorious People's Volunteers and the People's Liberation Army, help them solve their difficulties in life, and also express respect and condolences to the parents who persuade their children to join military cadre schools.

　　Third, we must assist the government in eliminating special agents and bandits, and eliminate counter-revolutionary rumors. And help women who have been deceived into joining reactionary secret societies to withdraw from the secret societies, so as to consolidate the rear of the Volunteers Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea and consolidate the people's democratic order of our motherland.

　　Fourth, we must resolutely eliminate all aggressive forces of U.S. imperialism in China. We especially hope that female Catholics and Christians will actively participate in the religious reform movement of self-government, self-support, and self-propagation, so that the Chinese church can become a religious undertaking run by the Chinese themselves.

　　Sisters from all walks of life in the capital, our demonstration and parade today is of great significance. We hope that after this demonstration and parade, the women's circles in the capital can strengthen various specific tasks and take our patriotic movement a step further. We also hope that everyone will consolidate the achievements of our patriotic movement by means of signing patriotic covenants and by means of organizing.

　　Long live the great unity of women in the capital!

　　Long live the victory of the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and oppose the U.S. arming of Japan!

　　蔡畅同志在首都妇女爱国大会上的讲话首都各界亲爱的姐妹们：
    今天首都妇女界举行的抗美援朝、反对美国重新武装日本的爱国示威游行，是有伟大意义的；是会在全国妇女同胞中间发生很大影响的。
    全国人民，包括我们妇女在内，在志愿的基础上展开的抗美援朝保家卫国运动，三个月以来已经获得伟大的成就。我国人民抗美援朝志愿军与朝鲜人民军并肩作战，已经歼灭了美国侵略军和李承晚伪军六万余人，使美国在朝鲜的武装侵略遭到了决定性的失败。
    三个多月以来，我们中国妇女和中国人民，热烈地展开了支援中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军的活动和其他各种爱国活动，展开了抗美援朝的时事学习和宣传。许多妇女组织了志愿救护队和战地服务队，到朝鲜前线工作。许多青年女学生参加了军事干部学校。各地成千成万的妇女，送自己的丈夫和子女参加志愿军和参加军事干部学校。各地女工热烈地投入爱国主义生产竞赛热潮。各地农妇和其他各界妇女同胞，热烈地为志愿军做军鞋、做棉衣，以及写信、做慰问袋、捐款、捐物慰问志愿军。为了提高自己的政治觉悟，全国各地妇女热烈地参加了抗美援朝的时事学习。而且为了表示中国妇女抗美援朝的决心，杭州、武汉、徐州等地的各界妇女，举行了示威游行。我国妇女和全国人民所取得的这一切成就，是应该庆祝的，是应该加以发扬光大的。
    但是美帝国主义者，还没有放弃他们的侵略计划。相反的，直到现在，美帝国主义者仍然坚持侵略我们的领土台湾省，仍然坚持侵略我们的邻邦朝鲜，并且正在加紧进行对日单独媾和，重新武装日本的阴谋活动。美帝国主义对于日本的这种狂妄的、卑鄙的计划，我们中国妇女和中国人民，是绝对不能容忍的，也是全亚洲和日本人民所不能容忍的。
    各位姐妹们！日本侵略者曾经侵略我国五十年之久，曾经在我国杀人放火，奸淫掳掠，不知有多少同胞，死在日本侵略者的刀下。这个深仇大恨，我们能够忘记吗？
    我们用八年血战换来的胜利，能够让美帝国主义一笔勾销吗？不能，永远不能！全国妇女和全国同胞，必须在援助朝鲜人民的同时，展开坚决反对美国对日单独媾和，重新武装日本的运动，和东方人民，日本人民在一起，争取签订全面的公正的对日和约。
    我们应该告诉日本妇女，我们中国妇女是和你们站在一起共同反对美帝国主义的。美帝国主义重新武装日本的计划，是毁灭日本和日本人民的计划，我们应当携起手来，反对这个万恶的计划。
    我们应该告诉菲律宾、新西兰、澳洲、印尼、马来亚、越南、泰国、缅甸和印度的妇女，我们必须团结一致，粉碎美帝国主义重新武装日本，威胁亚洲和平的万恶的计划。
    除此以外，在目前，我们还应该和全国人民在一起，进行以下各项具体工作：
    第一就是响应中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会的号召和朝鲜民主妇女总同盟的呼吁，写信及捐钱捐物慰劳中朝人民战士，救济朝鲜难民。
    第二就是要在春节展开尊敬和优待革命军人家属的运动，向光荣的人民志愿军和人民解放军的家属致敬，帮助他们解决生活上的困难，对于劝子女参加军事干部学校的家长，也要表示敬意和慰问。
    第三就是要协助政府，肃清特务土匪，消灭反革命的谣言。并且帮助被欺骗加入反动会道门的妇女退出会道门，来巩固抗美援朝志愿军的后方，巩固我们祖国的人民民主秩序。
    第四就是要坚决肃清美帝国主义在中国的一切侵略势力。我们特别希望天主教、基督教的女教徒积极参加自治、自养、自传的宗教革新运动，使中国教会成为中国人自办的宗教事业。
    首都各界姊妹们，今天我们的示威游行是有很大意义的。我们希望在这次示威游行以后，首都妇女界能够加强各种具体工作，把我们的爱国运动提高一步。我们并且希望大家，用订爱国公约的方法，用组织起来的方法，巩固我们爱国运动的成果。
    首都妇女界大团结万岁！
    抗美援朝和反对美国武装日本运动胜利万岁！
