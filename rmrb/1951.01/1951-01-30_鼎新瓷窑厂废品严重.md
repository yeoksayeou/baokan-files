　　Serious Waste at Dingxin Porcelain Factory
    Due to bureaucracy on the part of the leadership at the Pengcheng Public-Operated Dingxin Porcelain Factory in Hebei, a total of 8,518 porcelain teapots have been damaged in the past forty-odd days. Among these, 4,518 teapots, those with broken or crooked spouts, were unsellable, resulting in a loss of 8.2 million yuan. In the past, the factory's product inspection was merely carried out by a few cadres appointed by the administration, without the broad participation of workers and staff. Of the four factory directors, three were not experts, and only one understood the basics of the porcelain industry. However, they did not study or delve into the business and were also sloppy in inspecting products. For example, when Director Lu discovered substandard products during inspection, he pointed them out to the workers, but when the workers pushed back, he just left it alone.
    The coordination between the Party, government, and labor union was also poor. For example, last September, workers requested that the wage of four liang of rice per teapot be increased to eight liang. On this matter, the administration did not effectively rely on the labor union to educate the workers with patriotism and concrete accounting methods. The labor union, on the other hand, had a purely welfare-oriented viewpoint, neglecting leadership in production. As a result, although the wage per teapot was increased to six liang of rice, the workers' thinking was not straightened out; they only pursued production figures, regardless of product quality. The leadership did not inspect or study this abnormal situation, leading to serious losses.

　　鼎新瓷窑厂废品严重
    河北彭城公营鼎新瓷窑厂，由于领导上的官僚主义，最近四十余天中共损坏瓷壶八千五百一十八把。其中因壶嘴掉的、歪的不能卖出的占四千五百一十八把，损失达八百二十万元。该厂过去对产品的检查只是由行政上指定了几个干部担任，没有广泛吸收工人职员参加。四个厂长三个是外行，只有一个懂得瓷窑业常识。但他们对业务又不学习和钻研，检查产品也很马虎。如陆厂长在检查产品时发现有不合规格的地方，向工人提出来，但工人把他碰回去后，他就放到一边不管了。
    党政工的配合也很差。如去年九月间工人要求把每把壶四两米的工资增加到八两米，对这件事行政上没有很好的依靠工会用爱国主义的精神和具体算账的办法来教育工人。工会则存在单纯的福利观点，忽视领导生产。结果虽然每把壶的工资增加到六两米，但工人的思想没打通；只追求生产数字，也不管产品质量。领导上对这种不正常的情况，不检查不研究，以致造成严重的损失。
