　　Government Distributes Cotton-Padded Clothes to Impoverished Students
    Students in Beijing Schools Express Heartfelt Gratitude
    To the Editor:
    Currently, the economic situation of some students in Beijing is very poor. They rely entirely on the People's Stipend provided by the government to maintain their lives at school. Since the beginning of winter, a few students have lacked cotton-padded clothes to keep warm. Recently, the Beijing Student Union reflected the above situation to the relevant authorities, requesting a solution to the problem of cotton-padded clothing for impoverished students. In order to take care of the students' health, the Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education and the Central Ministry of Education each contributed funds in December 1950 to sew one hundred sets of cotton-padded clothing (each set costing approximately 120 catties of millet). The Beijing Student Union was responsible for distributing them to students in municipal secondary schools, colleges and universities, and national and provincial secondary schools who genuinely lacked warm clothing. A total of 157 sets of cotton-padded clothes were distributed, and 239 students lacking cotton-padded clothing received them. The remaining 43 sets are planned to be distributed to impoverished students at Peking University, Tsinghua University, and Beijing Normal University, which received fewer sets.
    This work was completed on December 24th of last year. The students are very satisfied with the People's Government's subsidy for cotton-padded clothing. Some students jumped for joy when they saw the new cotton-padded clothes. Students at New Life Girls' Middle School reflected, "The government provides stipends and cotton-padded clothes, solving all our problems." Zheng Jiaxing, a student at Chengda Middle School, said, "Before liberation, no one cared if you froze to death. The People's Government is really good. I will definitely cherish this outfit, because it is made from the people's millet." A fourth-year student in the Chinese Department of Peking University said, "The government's finances are very difficult, yet they still give us such good cotton-padded clothes." The students are very touched by the People's Government's concern for young people and its guarantee of the studies of impoverished students.

　　政府发给贫苦学生棉衣
    北京各校同学衷心感谢     编辑同志：
    目前，京市有一部分学生的经济情况很不好，他们在学校里完全靠政府发的人民助学金维持生活。入冬以来有少数学生没有棉衣御寒。日前，京市学生联合会曾将上述情况分别向各有关机关反映，请求设法解决贫寒同学的棉衣问题。为了照顾同学的健康，市文教局与中央教育部于一九五○年十二月间各出资缝制了棉衣一百套（每套约合小米一百二十斤），由京市学生联合会负责分别发给市属中等学校、专科以上学校及国立省立中等学校确实缺乏寒衣的同学们。共计发出棉衣一百五十七套，有二百三十九位缺棉衣同学领到了棉衣，尚余四十三套，准备继续发给发的较少的北大、清华和师大三校的贫苦同学。
    这个工作已于去年十二月二十四日结束。同学们对于人民政府补助棉衣一事非常满意，有些同学一看到新棉衣高兴得跳了起来。新生女中同学反映：“政府又给助学金，又给棉衣，什么问题都给我们解决”。成达中学郑家兴同学说：“解放前，冻死也没有人管，人民政府真是好，我一定好好爱护这身衣服，因为这是人民的小米做的”。北大中文系四年级一个同学说：“政府财政很困难，还发给我们这样好的棉衣”。同学们对人民政府如此关怀青年，保证穷苦同学的学习，都非常感动。
