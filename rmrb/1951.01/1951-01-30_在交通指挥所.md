　　At the Transportation Command Post
    Our Correspondent Tian Liu
    Behind the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, there are many, many transportation command posts. Vehicles loaded with military supplies, under its command, are transported to the front line in an orderly and swift manner; the brave warriors wounded while fighting for world peace and human justice are sent to the rear through here.
    The transportation command post has become the nerve center of logistical work. The tense and efficient work of the comrades in the command post guarantees the supply of the front line. On the evening of January 15th, I visited such a transportation command post. To avoid enemy aircraft disruption, the command post was located in a large sewer, a very beautiful basement. Inside, it was divided into sections of workrooms with wooden boards, and gas lamps emitted white light. At the front was the military representative's office, the telephone office, the telegraph office, and the railway's locomotive, engineering, and traffic sections, all sequentially located inside. In the past, I had been to many organizations and visited many offices, but nowhere did the work seem busier or more intense than here.
    I had to push my way through a long line of people to reach the military representative's office. After explaining my intentions to the military representative, I was squeezed aside by people urgently requesting solutions to various problems. After they left, I had a chance to talk to the military representative. In front of the military representative, all tasks were urgent. The captain leading more than a thousand stretcher bearers had just finished negotiating for vehicles to go to the front when a young military supplies escort officer squeezed forward. "You know how heavy a blow we will deal to the enemy in this campaign," the escort officer said urgently. "Please, military representative, have our ammunition transported away tonight." The military representative was about to answer when the phone rang. It was from his direct superior, the First Detachment of the Frontline Service Department, asking him to give all transportation resources to the transportation of gasoline, otherwise, the artillery vehicles and cars at the front would "stop" due to lack of fuel. A comrade escorting the wounded, panting, squeezed forward, "Please, transport the wounded away tonight, because every minute of delay on the road will increase the pain of the wounded by one point." The escort stated his reasons, and in order to have his work resolved quickly and smoothly, he even said, "Delaying the transport of the sick and wounded is not allowed at any time." More people, civilians, and soldiers continued to pour forward, raising various questions requesting solutions: some asked about the location of their troops and how to find their troops faster; some had broken shoes and asked for new shoes to continue their advance; those without provisions came to collect provisions; two young women of seventeen or eighteen years old - actors from the army's literary and artistic troupe, were injured in the foot by artillery vehicles while chasing the fleeing enemy, and now that their injuries had healed, they asked the military representative to help them return to their unit... Questions were raised one after another and resolved one after another, and people left in batches. But the number of people in the military representative's office did not decrease—on the contrary, it increased, and the basement was packed. The hot breath, like steam, spewed from the cave entrance into the sky.
    This intense work continued until three o'clock the next morning, when the basement gradually became quiet. Finally, after the military representative handed a bus ticket to a soldier requesting transportation, only the two of us were left in the office. He then began to organize the various large and small notes, certificates, letters of introduction, and other documents on the table, and said to me, "Okay, today's business is almost done, let's talk now."
    That night, one thousand six hundred and eighteen stretcher bearers went from here to the front; a number of wounded arrived here and were placed in appropriate "wards"; one hundred and twenty tons of ammunition were sent to the front line; the two women decided to go to the front with us tomorrow night to find their unit...
    This command post was established the day after the liberation of this place. At that time, the railway was bombed, the bridge collapsed into the river, and only a lonely route sign remained on the platform. The water supply equipment was destroyed. Nearby residents, in cooperation with the heroic Korean Railway Corps and a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Railway Corps, repaired the railway and opened it to traffic within three days. At first, the locomotives could not get water, and more than three hundred Korean women carried water basins on their heads from the river and wells to the boilers to enable the trains to run as soon as possible... Since the establishment of the transportation command post, in one month, thousands of tons of ammunition, supplies, clothing, medicines, and gasoline fuel have been loaded, unloaded, and transshipped from here - this is only one of the thousands of transportation command posts, only a drop in the huge logistical work. Every time the sun sets at dusk, when the night is vast, in North Korea, behind the People's Volunteer Army, trains, cars, ox-drawn carts, and man-pulled sledges loaded with military supplies pour from all roads to the front line, and groups of stretcher teams and militiamen advance bravely.
    "The Lunar New Year is coming soon," the military representative finally said to me, "In order to make the brave men have a very happy holiday, tons of pork, salted fish, sausages, cigarettes, white wine, various canned goods, and tons of white sugar are being rapidly transported to the front."
    In the basement, where the movement of the stars cannot be seen, it was already six o'clock in the morning, and the gas lamps were still emitting white light. "Let's take a walk outside!" the military representative suggested, "The morning in Korea is very beautiful."
    The day was about to break, and we walked along the river embankment. A breeze blew against our faces, and the moist air containing frost and fog invigorated us. We straightened our chests and looked up at the south where the enemy was fleeing.
    Soon we will go there. We all thought so.

　　在交通指挥所
    本报记者  田流
    朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的后方，有许多许多的交通指挥所。满载军需物资的车辆，在它指挥之下，有秩序地迅速地运往前线；为世界和平与人类正义而战斗负伤的勇士们，又经过这里送往后方。
    交通指挥所成了后勤工作的神经中枢。指挥所里同志们的紧张而有效率的工作，保证着前线的供应。一月十五日的黄昏，我访问了这样一个交通指挥所。为避免敌机的扰乱，指挥所设在一个大下水道里，是一个很漂亮的地下室。在它里面用木板隔成了一节一节的工作间，瓦斯灯放射着白色的光辉。最前面是军代表办公室，电话所，电报所，以及铁路上的机、工、车务各段，顺序地设在里面。过去，我曾到过许多机关，参观和访问过许多办公室，但看起来，那儿也没有这里的工作显得更忙碌，更紧张。
    我费了很大的劲，才从一长串的人群中挤到军代表办公室。向军代表说明来意后，我就被急迫要求解决各种各样问题的人挤到一边去，在他们走了之后，我才有机会找到军代表谈话。在军代表面前，一切任务都是急迫的。率领着一千余名担架队员的大队长，交涉车辆到前方的话刚说完，一位年青的军需押运员又挤上前来，“你知道在这次战役中，我们要给敌人多重的打击，”押运员急促地说，“请军代表今夜把我们的弹药运走。”军代表正要回答，电话响了，是他的直接上级——前方勤务部第一分部来的，要他把一切的运输力量，都让给运输汽油，不然，前方的炮车、汽车便会因缺乏燃料“停止下来”。护送伤员的同志气喘着挤上前来，“务请于今夜把伤员们运走，因为，在路上多停留一分钟，就会增加伤员一分痛苦。”护送员陈述着理由，为着使自己的工作得到迅速而顺利的解决，他甚至说：“迟运伤病员，是任何时候都不允许的。”有更多的人，民工、战士继续涌上前来，提出各种各样的问题请求解决：有的问他们的队伍在什么方位，怎样才能更快地找到自己的队伍；有的鞋子坏了，要求换上新的鞋子，再继续前进；没有给养的人则来领给养；两个十七、八岁的女同志——随军文艺工作团的演员，因随军追击溃逃的敌人时，被炮车轧伤了脚，现在伤好了，要求军代表帮助他们归队……。问题一个接着一个地提出来，也一个接着一个地得到解决，人一批一批地走出去。但军代表办公室的人却并不见减少——反而越来越多起来了，地下室被挤得满满的。呼吸的热气，像蒸气一样，从洞口喷向天空。
    这种紧张的工作，一直继续到次日清晨三时，地下室才慢慢的静寂下来。最后军代表将一张乘车证交给一位要求乘车的战士之后，办公室只剩下我们两个人了，他才一面整理着桌上各种各样大小不一的条据、证明、介绍信和其他文件，一面向我说：“好了，今天的事情差不多了，现在咱们谈谈吧。”
    这天夜里有一千六百一十八名担架队员从这里走向前方；有若干伤员来到这里被安置到适当的“病房”里；一百二十吨弹药送上了前线；那两位女同志决定明天夜里和我们一同往前方，找她们的部队……
    这个指挥所是此地解放后第二天建立的，那时候，铁路被炸毁了，桥梁塌在河里，站台上只剩下孤零零的一根路线，给水的设备被破坏了。附近的居民配合英勇的朝鲜铁道兵团和中国人民志愿军铁道兵团某部，三天之内就把铁路修复通车了。最初机车不能上水，三百余名朝鲜妇女用头顶着水盆从河里、井里汲水上到锅炉里，使火车早日运行……。交通指挥所从建立的那天起，一个月的时间，从这里装卸、转运的弹药、给养、被服、药品及汽油燃料等已达数千吨——这只是千百个交通指挥所中的一个，只是巨大的后勤工作中的一滴而已。每当黄昏日落，夜色苍茫的时候，在北朝鲜，在人民志愿军的后方，满载军需物资的火车、汽车以及牛拖大轮车、人拉爬犁便从各条道路上涌往前线，成群结队的担架队、民兵奋勇前进着。
    “旧历年快到了，”最后，军代表向我这样说着，“为着使勇士们过一个非常快乐的节日，成吨的猪肉、咸鱼、香肠、纸烟、白酒、各种罐头和成吨的白糖，正迅速地运往前方。”
    地下室里，看不见星辰的移动，已经是早晨六点钟了，瓦斯灯依然放射着白色的光辉。“我们到外面散散步吧！”军代表提议着，“朝鲜的早晨是很美丽的。”
    天就要亮了，我们沿着河堤走着。微风迎面吹来，含有霜雾的湿润的空气，使我们精神振奋，我们挺起胸膛，昂首瞻望着敌人正在溃逃的南方。
    很快我们就会到那里去的。我们都这样地想。去的。我们都这样地想。
