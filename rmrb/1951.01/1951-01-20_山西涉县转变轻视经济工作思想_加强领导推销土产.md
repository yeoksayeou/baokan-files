The CCP She County Committee in Shanxi Province, in order to strengthen urban-rural material exchange and promote local products to purchase goods needed by the masses, convened a meeting of county and district party member cadres and village branch secretaries on the 7th of this month, so that everyone correctly recognizes the importance of material exchange.

According to our county’s preliminary statistics, this year's persimmon cake production is approximately 1.92 million catties, of which 900,000 catties have been sold, and 1.02 million catties remain; walnut production is 519,500 catties, with 440,000 catties remaining; black date production is 1.15 million catties, with 200,000 catties sold, and 950,000 catties remaining; daylily and other local products also urgently need to be sold; other items such as mats from the first, second, and fifth districts, and *chutiao* (raw material for papermaking) from the sixth district also need to be sold as soon as possible to exchange for New Year goods needed by farmers for the Spring Festival.

At this meeting, cadres at all levels corrected their past tendency to not pay enough attention to material exchange. For example, the county party committee ideologically neglected this work, and the district and village party member cadres' thinking was even more serious. They all believed that material exchange work should be the business of urban merchants, or should be managed by state-owned commercial enterprises and cooperatives, and that there was no need to be concerned about this work. In addition to correcting the above-mentioned erroneous views, the meeting especially made everyone realize that promoting their own local products is inseparable from agricultural production, because if the produced goods cannot be sold, it will inevitably affect production; at the same time, everyone realized that it is also very important to promote local products with leadership and planning. For example, last year, the price of persimmon cakes was high at first, but the farmers were unwilling to sell them at that time, and in the end, no one wanted the goods, resulting in a lot of persimmon cakes being spoiled. In August and September this year, some merchants purchased walnuts, but the farmers did not sell them, as they waited to sell them at higher prices based on experience, but now no one wants them. This is the result of a lack of leadership, which caused the masses to suffer losses. Our county now has 1 million catties of persimmon cakes in stock, which the native product company plans to purchase in full, thus solving some of the difficulties of the masses. The county supply and marketing cooperative also plans to purchase some cotton, peppercorns and other mountain goods. We are also preparing to organize some private merchants and peddlers, and mobilize the masses to find ways to promote the existing local products, so as to exchange them for the New Year goods and other daily necessities they need. The village chiefs and branch secretaries of various villages are now conveying this idea of promoting local products to every farmer. The farmers of Beigang Village are discussing and formulating sales plans.

### 山西涉县转变轻视经济工作思想  加强领导推销土产

　　山西涉县转变轻视经济工作思想
    加强领导推销土产
    中共涉县县委会为加强城乡物资交流工作，推销当地土产，购回群众需用物品，于本月七日召开县区党员干部及村支部书记会议，使大家正确地认识到物资交流的重要性。
    据我县初步统计今年产柿饼约一百九十二万斤，已推销九十万斤，现存一百零二万斤；核桃产五十一万九千五百斤，现存四十四万斤；黑枣产一百一十五万斤，已销出二十万斤，现存九十五万斤；黄花菜等土产亦急待外销；其他如一、二、五区的席子、六区初条（造纸用料）等物亦需及早销出，换回农民需要的春节年货。
    在这次会议上，各级干部纠正了过去对物资交流不够重视的偏向。如县委在思想上是忽视这个工作的，区村党员干部的这种思想更加严重。都认为物资交流工作应该是城市商人的事情，或者是应该由国营商业和合作社去经营就够了，就可以不用再关心这个工作了。会议上，除纠正上述错误观点外，特别使大家都认识到推销自己的土产品是与农业生产分不开的，因为生产出来的东西销不了，必然要影响生产；同时也使大家认识到要有领导和有计划地推销土产也是很重要的。像去年，柿饼价格先是高的，但当时农民却不肯出卖，而到最后货又没有人要了，结果柿饼坏了不少。今年八、九月间有商贩收购核桃，而农民却不卖，他们经验主义地等待价钱高些再卖，但现在却没有人要了。这都是缺乏领导的结果，使群众吃了亏。我县现存柿饼一百万斤，已由土产公司计划全部收购，这样解决群众的一些困难。县供销社亦拟收购些棉花、花椒等山货。我们并准备组织些私商小贩，并发动群众自己想尽办法推销现有的土产，以便换回他们需要的年货及其他日用品。各村村长和支部书记现在正将这个推销土产的思想带给每一个农民，北岗村的农民正在讨论和制订销货计划。
