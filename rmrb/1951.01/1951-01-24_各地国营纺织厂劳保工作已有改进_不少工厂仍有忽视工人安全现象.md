Labor protection work in state-owned textile factories across various regions has improved to a considerable extent since the key inspection conducted in Tianjin last February by the Ministry of Labor, the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Textile Industry, and the Textile Workers' Union of the Central People's Government. Some factories under the China Textile Construction Company in Tianjin and Qingdao, as well as individual factories in Shanghai, have installed ventilation devices or air-cooling systems in their workshops. Tianjin No. 3 Cotton Textile Factory has installed motor guards around motors and safety shields on the lap machines. Shanghai State-Owned Flax Mill has installed two dust collectors. To ensure that workers can eat hot meals, state-owned textile factories in Tianjin, Qingdao, Shanghai, Wuhan, and the Northeast region have successively established or expanded worker canteens and installed equipment for steaming food. Most state-owned textile factories in Tianjin and Qingdao have also provided workers with tea mugs with lids. In terms of medical care, factories in Tianjin, Shanghai, and Qingdao have not only added medical personnel, but some medical staff also work shifts in the workshops at night. Due to strengthened safety measures and improved medical and health work, worker injury and illness rates have been greatly reduced, playing a considerable role in ensuring the completion of national production tasks.

However, some state-owned factories still neglect worker safety. For example, the lack of safety devices on machinery remains a relatively common phenomenon. Shanghai State-Owned Cotton Textile Factories also still have many shortcomings in terms of hygiene. Neglect of labor protection is particularly serious in private factories. In Shanghai's eighteen private cotton textile factories, from August 1949 to August of last year, there were as many as 2,299 work-related injuries alone. High temperature and humidity are common problems in private textile factories. In summer, a certain yarn factory in Wuhan sees many workers faint every day, and in some private yarn factories in southern Jiangsu, "the mist is like rain, and the ground is like an ice rink." In order to effectively protect workers' lives, safety, and health, and to further enhance workers' enthusiasm for production, this serious phenomenon of neglecting labor protection work must be corrected urgently.

### 各地国营纺织厂劳保工作已有改进  不少工厂仍有忽视工人安全现象

　　各地国营纺织厂劳保工作已有改进
    不少工厂仍有忽视工人安全现象
    【本报讯】各地国营纺织厂的劳动保护工作，自去年二月中央人民政府劳动部、卫生部、纺织工业部和纺织工会在天津进行重点检查以后，已有相当改善。天津、青岛中国纺织建设公司有些厂，上海个别厂都在车间安装了通风装置或打冷气的装置。天津棉纺三厂在马达周围装置了马达栏，在清花机练子上装置了安全罩。上海国营麻纺厂装置了两只除尘器。为了使工人们能吃到热饭，天津、青岛、上海、武汉、东北地区的国营纺织厂都相继建立或扩大了工人食堂，建立了蒸热饭的设备。天津、青岛大部国营纺织厂且为工人置备了带盖的茶缸。在医疗方面，天津、上海、青岛各厂不仅增添了医务人员，而且有些医务人员夜里还到车间值班。由于加强安全措施，改善医疗卫生工作，工人伤病率大减，对保证国家生产任务的完成起了相当作用。
    但某些国营工厂迄今仍然忽视工人安全。如机器没有安全装置仍然是比较普遍的现象。上海国营棉纺厂在卫生方面也还有不少缺点。忽视劳动保护，在私营工厂中尤为严重。上海十八个私营棉纺织厂自一九四九年八月到去年八月，只工伤一项就有二千二百九十九人之多。温度、湿度很高，是私营纺织厂比较普遍的现象。在夏天武汉某纱厂一天就要晕倒好多工人，苏南有些私营纱厂“喷雾似喷雨，地上像滑冰”。为切实保障工人生命安全与健康，以进一步提高工人生产的积极性，这种忽视劳动保护工作的严重现象亟须改正。
