　　Hunan Zhuzhou Railway Factory
    Disunity Among Leading Cadres
    Causes Significant Production Losses

    Hu Xiguang, the political commissar of the Zhuzhou Railway Factory under the Hengyang Railway Administration, and Wang Mulin, the chairman of the labor union, are engaged in serious, unprincipled disputes, causing great losses in production. Comrades Hu and Wang are both veteran cadres who have participated in the revolution for a long time, but in their work at the Zhuzhou Railway Factory, they have not united to jointly solve important production problems. They do not pay attention to workers' rationalization proposals, rarely go deep into the worksite, and both see themselves as heroes, acting like senior officials. After Wang Mulin arrived at the factory, he complained about the poor quality of his housing, and ordered workers to build a kitchen for him three times. He constantly boasted about being a "division-level cadre," and was constantly at odds with Hu. In their work, Wang often opposed Hu from a one-sided "labor union standpoint," while Hu also failed to help him correct his shortcomings in good faith. At the party's general branch committee meetings (Hu is the secretary, Wang is a member), they often replaced discussions of principled issues with quarrels. Their mutual disagreements have caused great losses to production. At first, the factory's production plan was submitted to the labor union for discussion by the administration, but Wang shelved it and ignored it. Afterwards, it was no longer submitted to the labor union. The plan was unrealistic to begin with, and it was not discussed by the workers. As a result, the entire factory failed to meet its targets every month, but sometimes the workers had nothing to do. The labor organization and labor discipline of the workers are extremely chaotic. Workers in the boiler team of the locomotive depot said: "Our entire team of twenty-five people has five foremen. Everyone is in charge, but no one is in charge. Although the equipment is good, the work efficiency is not as good as that of small factories." Many people do not observe working hours, and some are found warming themselves by the fire and chatting during working hours, or even casually going to grow vegetables and buy things. The task of repairing cars was not completed in 1950; rework has become a common phenomenon. The connecting rod large copper bushing of locomotive No. 889 was reworked six times. In the three months of June, July, and August last year alone, there were thirty-three cases of rework on locomotives, passenger cars, and freight cars, thirty-two pieces of damaged machinery, and one hundred and seventy-one instances of damaged tools. Workers said painfully: "With such destruction, even if the factory is built, the machines will be ruined." A small number of hidden bad elements constantly take the opportunity to sabotage. Even the sentry of the factory's guard unit had his leg injured by bandits and special agents. The activists among the workers are threatened by bad elements, and evil is suppressing righteousness. The responsible comrades in the factory are usually numb to this serious situation and panic when something happens. After the water pump of locomotive No. 847 was sabotaged, the workers reported it to the leading comrades, but the leadership ignored it. At one point, Wang Mulin mistakenly regarded the self-organized picket team of workers as overtime work and ordered it to be disbanded. The workers were afraid that the factory would be damaged, so they later organized themselves again.

    The Hengyang "Railway Worker" newspaper has criticized and reported on the above-mentioned shortcomings of the leading cadres of the Zhuzhou Railway Factory five times, but it has not attracted the attention it deserves from the leading organs. It was not until mid-November of last year that the Hengyang Railway Administration sent cadres to the factory to help the general branch conduct a rectification campaign, but the problem was not well resolved. In the end, Wang Mulin was simply transferred to work in the Administration, and Hu Xiguang was approved to leave the factory for sick leave. We believe that the handling of this issue is not serious and thorough enough.

    Editor's Note: Hu Xiguang and Wang Mulin, as leading cadres of the Party and the labor union, have seriously damaged production due to unprincipled disputes, creating a very bad impression among the masses. The Hengyang "Railway Worker" newspaper has repeatedly criticized this undesirable phenomenon, but the Hengyang Railway Administration has failed to deal with it in a timely and serious manner, which is wrong. It is hoped that the leaders of the Hengyang Railway Administration can help Wang Mulin and Hu Xiguang deeply recognize their mistakes in order to achieve the goal of educating cadres and improving their work, and that the results of the investigation will be made public.

### 湖南株州铁路工厂  领导干部不团结  使生产遭受重大损失

　　湖南株州铁路工厂
    领导干部不团结
    使生产遭受重大损失
    衡阳铁路管理局株州铁路工厂政委胡锡光和工会主席王慕林，严重的闹无原则纠纷，使生产上受了很大的损失。胡、王两同志都是参加革命很久的老干部，但在株州铁路工厂工作中，他们不是团结一致，共同解决生产上的重要问题；他们不注意工人合理化建议，很少深入现场，都以功臣自居，摆老资格。王慕林到工厂，便嫌住的房子不好，曾三次叫厂里的工人给他修厨房，动不动摆弄自己是“师级干部”，与胡碰到一起便互不服气。在工作中王常常以片面的“工会立场”和胡对立，而胡也不能善意地帮助他纠正缺点。在党的总支委员会上（胡是书记，王是委员），常常用吵嘴代替对原则问题的讨论。他们这样互相闹意见，就给生产造成很大损失。厂里的生产计划，开始时行政上还提交工会讨论，但王却压起不管，以后也就不交给工会了。计划本来订得不切实际，又未经工人讨论，结果全厂月月完不成任务，但有时工人却又闲着没活可干。工人的劳动组织和劳动纪律非常混乱。机车场锅炉班的工友说：“我们全班二十五个人就有五个领班，谁也管，谁也不管，设备虽然好，工作效率还不如人家小厂子。”不少人不遵守工作时间，有的在工作时间烤火聊天，甚至随便去种菜买东西。一九五○年修车任务没有完成；反工成了普遍现象，八八九号机车的连杆大铜套就反了六次工，光是去年六、七、八三个月，机客货车反工就有三十三件，损坏机器三十二件，损坏工具一七一次。工友们痛心地说：“像这样的破坏，厂建起来了，机器也完蛋了。”少数暗藏的坏分子则不断乘机破坏，连工厂警卫部队的哨兵也被匪特打伤了腿。职工中的积极分子受到坏分子的威胁，邪气压着正气。厂里负责同志对于这种严重情况，平时麻痹，遇事慌张。八四七号机车水泵遭破坏后，工人曾报告领导同志，但领导上却置之不理。有一个时期，王慕林却把工人自动组织的纠察队，错误地看作加班加点，命令把它解散。工人们怕厂子受到破坏，后来又自动地组织起来。
    对株州铁路工厂领导干部的上述缺点，衡阳《铁路工人》报前后曾作了五次批评报道，却未引起领导机关应有的重视。直到去年十一月中旬，衡阳铁路管理局始派干部到该厂，帮助总支进行了一次整风，但问题并未很好解决，最后只是将王慕林调至管理局工作及批准胡锡光离厂养病。我们认为对这问题的处理是不够认真和彻底的。
              清沧、赵振球、杨柄          
    编者按：胡锡光、王慕林身为党的和工会的领导干部，因闹无原则纠纷，严重损害了生产，在群众中造成极不良的印象。衡阳《铁路工人》报对此种不良现象，曾一再进行批评，而衡阳铁路管理局却未能及时认真处理，这是不对的。望衡阳铁路管理局领导上能帮助王慕林、胡锡光深刻认识自己的错误，以达到教育干部改进工作的目的，并将检查结果公布。
