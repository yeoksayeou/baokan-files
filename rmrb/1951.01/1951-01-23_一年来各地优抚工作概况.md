　　Overview of Preferential Treatment Work in Various Regions Over the Past Year
    In 1950, the work of governments at all levels across the country in providing preferential treatment and relief to the families of martyrs, revolutionary soldiers, and revolutionary workers achieved remarkable results. The main reason was the correct implementation of the policy of "focusing on organizing production and introducing employment, combined with material relief."

    The families of martyrs, soldiers, and workers mostly reside in rural areas. Therefore, doing a good job in land cultivation on behalf of poor families of martyrs, soldiers, and workers has become a major issue in the entire preferential treatment work. Over the past year, governments at all levels have attached great importance to this work, promptly issuing instructions on land cultivation on behalf of families, and universally inspecting and rectifying the work. Many provinces, cities, and counties have discussed and arranged land cultivation work through people's representative conferences or civil affairs conferences; they have convened forums for military families to study and improve cultivation methods. Some places have also held training courses for village cadres, specifically educating them on how to organize and lead land cultivation work. The biggest feature of the national land cultivation work last year was the universal implementation of fixed cultivation systems in old liberated areas and some new areas, with a focus on adopting work-point systems and wage systems. These cultivation systems are far superior to the previous method of temporary work assignments, enabling fairness and reasonableness, and are supported by the broad masses of cadres and people. Those who cultivate land on behalf of military families are very active and responsible in cultivating their land, ensuring timely cultivation, fertilization, weeding, and harvesting. According to a typical survey of 57 villages in four districts of Lincheng, Shandong, the land of 222 households enjoying cultivation on their behalf was all cultivated simultaneously with the land of the masses, and summer harvesting, summer planting, and summer weeding were all timely, with summer weeding generally reaching three or four times. According to a survey of 36 villages in Yanqing, Chahar, the land of military families was ensured to be timely in planting, hoeing seedlings, fertilizing, and harvesting, with fertilization exceeding the original amount by 20% to 30%, so that the output was no less than that of the general public. In Sanhe Village, Mishan County, Songjiang Province, when cutworms were found in the field of military family member Shang Yunxiu, the contracted farming team immediately mobilized and quickly eliminated them. Because the masses actively cultivated on their behalf, the yield of military family land was guaranteed and increased, significantly improving the lives of poor military families. For example, in Jiaxinzi Village, Jixian County, Songjiang Province, all 1,240 mu of cultivated land on behalf of thirty military families exceeded the normal yield last year. In Wangzhangzi Village, Chaoyang County, Rehe Province, the grain harvested by twenty-nine military families last year was enough for twenty households to eat for one and a half to two years, and the rest were enough for the whole year. This is a major achievement in this year's preferential treatment work.

    Local governments mainly adopted the method of organizing urban poor military families to participate in handicraft and processing industry production or introducing employment to help solve their livelihood problems. The facts of the past year have proved that this policy is completely correct. Beijing has 66 military family production organizations, with approximately 5,100 family members of martyrs, soldiers, and workers participating in production. From January to November last year, their total income in wages and profits was more than 920,000 jin of millet, and more than 1,000 people were employed through introductions. In Tianjin, more than 3,000 family members of martyrs, soldiers, and workers obtained employment last year. The military family production organizations in various districts totaled 26 units, absorbing more than 800 family members of martyrs, soldiers, and workers, as well as disabled revolutionary soldiers and demobilized soldiers to participate in production. In the military family sack factory in Harbin, more than 500 family members of martyrs and soldiers participated in production, with each person earning a minimum of 1 million Northeast currency per month, equivalent to more than 220 jin of sorghum rice. Fushun City introduced 95.5% of the military families with labor to work in factories and mines. Five military family shoe factories in Kaifeng City can maintain the lives of more than 1,000 people. In the past year or so, the Shanghai Municipal People's Government has helped poor military families establish five military family mutual aid service agencies, three practical goods supply and marketing cooperatives, one joint cotton weaving factory, one cinder production and supply and marketing cooperative, and 158 bicycle parking stations. More than 1,300 family members of martyrs, soldiers, and workers in the city have participated in production and obtained employment through introductions. Jinan, Qingdao and other places have also organized the families of martyrs and soldiers to carry out production.

    Simultaneously with organizing production and introducing employment, the Central People's Government and local governments at all levels allocated a large amount of grain to provide relief to the families of martyrs, soldiers, and workers who lacked labor and could not maintain their lives. Last year, the Central People's Government directly allocated more than 600 million jin of preferential treatment grain to various regions. Local governments at all levels also allocated a portion from local grain as preferential treatment grain. Beijing issued approximately 1.7 million jin of preferential treatment grain last year. In the first half of last year, Shenyang City allocated 417,000 jin of military family subsidy grain and 130 million Northeast currency. Of the 50 million jin of relief grain allocated by Shandong Province last year, 70% was designated as preferential relief grain for families of martyrs, soldiers, and workers for relief and organization purposes. From January to the end of November last year, the families of martyrs, soldiers, and workers in Shanghai received a total of approximately 450 million yuan in relief funds. Before October last year, the Central-South Military and Political Committee successively allocated more than 3.7 million jin of grain to subsidize local governments in handling preferential treatment work; and specially allocated 6 million jin of grain to provide relief and condolences to the families of martyrs, soldiers, and workers in the old liberated areas of the land revolution era. Last year, eight special districts in Henan Province issued a total of more than 18.68 million jin of preferential family grain in the spring and winter seasons. In the autumn and winter seasons, the Wanbei District issued more than 16.43 million jin of preferential family relief grain. In addition, local governments at all levels gave spiritual and material condolences and rewards to the families of martyrs, soldiers, and workers on various festivals, such as sending New Year cards, hanging glorious lanterns, and distributing various condolence items. Various localities also paid special attention to assisting the children of poor families of martyrs, soldiers, and workers to obtain opportunities for schooling.

　　一年来各地优抚工作概况
    一九五○年全国各地人民政府优待和救济烈士、革命军人和革命工作人员家属工作获得显著成绩，主要原因是正确贯彻了“以组织生产、介绍职业为主、结合实物救济”的方针。
    烈、军、工属多居住农村，因此，作好为贫苦烈、军、工属的土地代耕工作，成为整个优抚工作中的重大问题。一年来各地人民政府对这一工作非常重视，适时地发布了代耕工作的指示，普遍检查和整顿了代耕工作。许多省、市县都通过各界人民代表会议或民政会议，讨论和布置代耕工作；召开军属座谈会，研究改进代耕方法。有的地方还举办村干部训练班，专门教育村干部如何组织领导代耕工作。去年全国代耕工作中的一个最大特点，是老区和部分新区普遍实行了固定代耕制，有重点地采用了工票制和工资制。这几种代耕制度远较过去临时派工的办法优越，能够作到公平合理，为广大干部群众所拥护。代耕者对于耕种军属的土地都很积极负责，作到按时耕种、施肥、锄草和收割。据山东临城四个区五十七个村的典型调查，享受代耕的二百二十二户的土地，全部与群众的土地同时耕种完毕，夏收、夏种和夏锄都很及时，夏锄一般达到三遍或四遍。据察哈尔延庆三十六个村的调查，军属的土地作到播种、锄苗、施肥和收割样样及时，施肥量并超过原定数百分之二十到三十，使产量不低于一般群众。松江省密山县三合村军属商云秀的地里发现夜盗虫，包耕组马上出动并迅速扑灭。因为群众积极代耕，就保证和提高了军属土地的产量，使贫苦军属的生活获得显著改进。如松江省集贤县夹信子村全村三十户军属的一千二百四十亩代耕土地，去年都超过了常年产量。热河省朝阳县王杖子村二十九户军属去年所收获的粮食，有二十户够吃一年半到两年，其余各户都够今年全年食用。这是今年全国优抚工作中的一大成绩。
    各地人民政府对于城市贫苦军属，主要采取组织他们参加手工业、加工工业的生产或介绍职业的办法，来帮助解决他们的生活问题。一年来的事实证明，这一方针是完全正确的。北京市有各种军属生产组织六十六个单位，参加生产的烈、军、工属约五千一百多人，去年一至十一月共收入工资和盈利九十二万多斤小米，经介绍获得职业的有一千余人。天津市去年有烈、军、工属三千多人获得职业，各区军属生产组织共二十六个单位，吸收了八百多个烈、军、工属和革命残废军人及复员军人参加生产。哈尔滨市的军属麻袋厂中，参加生产的烈、军属有五百多名，每人每月最少收入东北币一百多万元，折合高粱米二百二十多斤。抚顺市将百分之九十五点五有劳力的军属介绍到工厂矿山工作。开封市五个军属鞋厂，可以维持一千多人的生活。上海市人民政府一年多以来，帮助贫苦军属建立了五个军属互助服务社、三个实用物品供销社、一个联合棉织厂、一个煤渣生产供销社和一百五十八个自行车停放站。全市已参加生产和经介绍获得职业的烈、军、工属有一千三百多人。济南、青岛等地也均组织了烈、军属进行生产。
    与组织生产和介绍职业同时，中央人民政府和各地人民政府拨发了大批粮食，救济缺乏劳动力而无法维持生活的烈、军、工属。中央人民政府去年直接拨付给各地的优抚粮达六亿余斤。各地人民政府亦从地方粮中拨出一部分充作优抚粮，北京市去年共发放优抚粮约一百七十多万斤。沈阳市去年上半年拨发的军属补助粮达四十一万七千斤和东北币一亿三千万元。山东省去年拨出的五千万斤救济粮中，规定其中百分之七十为救济和组织烈、军、工属的优救粮。上海市内的烈、军、工属，在去年一至十一月底，总共得到约四亿五千万元的救济金。中南军政委员会去年十月前，先后拨出粮食三百七十多万斤，补助各地人民政府办理优抚工作；并特别拨出六百万斤粮食，救济和抚恤土地革命时代老解放区的烈、军、工属。河南省八个专区去年分春冬两季共发放了优属粮一千八百六十八万余斤。皖北区于秋冬两季，即发出优属救济粮一千六百四十三万多斤。此外，各地人民政府在各种节日，都予烈、军、工属以精神的和物资的慰问与慰劳，如送贺年片，挂光荣灯，分发各种慰劳品等。各地还特别注意协助贫苦烈、军、工属的子弟获得求学的机会。
