Xinhua News Agency, Dalian, 19th. The people of the Lü (Shun) Da (Lian) area express their sincere gratitude for the selfless spirit and great friendship of the Soviet Union in transferring the properties under temporary administration or lease to our country without compensation. Zou Jiuzheng, Deputy Director of the Dalian Glass Factory, recalling the Soviet experts' help in restoring the factory's production, said: "The Soviet Red Army liberated our factory from the rule of the Japanese invaders, but at that time there were no raw materials and it could not be started. Soviet experts painstakingly studied how to replace them with locally produced raw materials and restored production. Soviet experts also patiently taught us scientific production methods, so that our output last year exceeded the average annual output during the Japanese occupation by 365.9 percent. The Soviet Union helped us build the factory, and now they have handed the factory over to us. How great, fair, and grateful is this spirit." Liu Maoyou, a labor hero of Lüda industrial production, said: "The Soviet elder brother helped us to improve the factory and handed it over to us. We must continue to learn from the Soviet elder brother and manage the factory better." Shi Yingzhou, Director of a certain shipyard, said, "I am almost forty years old, and the facts prove that only the Soviet Union is our most reliable friend and teacher." Zhao Guilan, a famous factory protection model, Wang Zhaoda, who created a model advanced production group, and others unanimously expressed their gratitude to the Soviet Union for its selflessness and great friendship, and stated that they would learn from the Soviet Union better in the future and work hard to produce.

　　旅大地区人民感激苏联移交财产
    【新华社大连十九日电】旅（顺）大（连）地区人民对苏联将临时代管或租用的财产无偿地移交我国的大公无私精神和伟大友谊行动，表示真诚感激。大连玻璃工厂副厂长邹就正回忆苏联专家帮助该厂恢复生产的情形说：“苏联红军把我们的工厂从日寇统治下解放了，但当时没有原料，不能开工。苏联专家苦心地研究了以本地出产的原料来代替，恢复了生产。苏联专家还耐心地教给我们科学的生产方法，使我们去年产量超过了日寇统治时平均年产量的百分之三百六十五点九。苏联帮助我们把工厂建设起来了，现在又把工厂交给了我们，这种精神是多么伟大公正和令人感激。”旅大工业生产劳动英雄刘茂有说：“苏联老大哥帮助我们把工厂搞好了，交给了我们，我们一定要继续向老大哥学习，把工厂管理得更好。”某修船厂厂长施英洲说：“我是快四十岁的人了，事实证明只有苏联才是我们最可靠的朋友和老师。”著名护厂模范赵桂兰、创造模范先进生产小组的王兆达等一致对苏联的大公无私和伟大友谊表示感激，并表示今后要更好地向苏联学习，努力生产。
