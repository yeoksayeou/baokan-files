Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 13th - During the temporary occupation of Pyongyang, local overseas Chinese compatriots suffered greatly from the atrocities and plunder of the US-Li Gang's troops. After invading Pyongyang, the US-Li Gang's troops immediately colluded with Kuomintang secret agents to organize a fake "Overseas Chinese Protection Corps," which specialized in framing and extorting local overseas Chinese and arrested a large number of them. In Pyeongcheon-ri alone, thirteen overseas Chinese farmers were arrested, and their whereabouts remain unknown. When the US-Li Gang's troops fled south, they machine-gunned a large number of civilians on the banks of the Daedong River, including more than seventy overseas Chinese.

Overseas Chinese farmers in the Daetodong area of ​​West Pyongyang, who made a living by growing vegetables, were brutally looted by the US-Li Gang's troops. Liu Lishan, an overseas Chinese in Chongseong-ri, was robbed by the US-Li Gang's troops as many as six times. He was robbed of a clock, two watches, 5,600 yuan in cash, more than 700 heads of cabbage, more than 200 "kwan" (100 taels per "kwan") of radishes, and 15 "kwan" of green onions. Overseas Chinese Lü Kegong and Liu Yusheng were robbed of 580 and 800 heads of cabbage respectively. The wife of overseas Chinese farmer Yu Zhinan in Hwanggeum-ri was raped by the enemy soldiers.

　　美李匪军侵占平壤期间
    我国侨胞横遭迫害
    【新华社平壤十三日电】在平壤暂时沦陷期间，当地侨胞曾饱受美、李匪军的残害与劫掠。美李匪军在侵陷平壤后，即勾结国民党特务分子，组织伪“华侨保卫团”，专门诬害与敲诈当地华侨，并逮捕了大批侨胞。仅在平川里，就有十三个华侨农民被捕，迄今下落不明。美、李匪军在南逃时，曾在大同江岸以机关枪射杀大批平民，被害者中华侨达七十余人。
    西平壤大驼岭一带以菜园为生的华侨农民曾惨遭美、李匪军的洗劫。铳盛里的华侨刘立善曾被美、李匪军劫掠六次之多。先后共被抢去一只座钟、两只手表、五千六百元现金、七百余棵白菜、二百余贯（每贯一百两）萝卜以及十五贯大葱。华侨吕可宫及刘玉盛分别被抢去白菜五百八十棵及八百棵。黄金里的华侨农民于志南的妻子，曾被匪军所强奸。
