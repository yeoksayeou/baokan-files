　　美青年保卫和平大会已选出常设委员会
    【新华社十日讯】塔斯社纽约八日讯：美国二百五十名青年领袖在芝加哥举行的“青年保卫和平大会”（昨译“青年拥护和平大会”），已成立常设组织，以作为团结美国青年为和平而斗争的中心。大会着重指出了团结美国一切青年为反对战争而斗争的必要。大会表明，美国青年认为必须进行和平谈判解决国际争端，并展开广泛的和平运动。
    大会决定派一代表团向联合国敦促举行和平谈判，并派一代表团到华盛顿去向美国政府反对实行军国主义化和强迫性的兵役。
    大会选出了以黑人青年牧师肯纳德为主席的常设委员会。
    肯纳德报告他曾出席的华沙第二届世界保卫和平大会的情形以及随后访问苏联的情形：“凡是看见过斯大林格勒的人，心里决不会相信这样国家的人民会赞成战争的。”
