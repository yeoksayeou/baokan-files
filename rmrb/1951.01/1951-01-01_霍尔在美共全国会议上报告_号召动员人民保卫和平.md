Xinhua News Agency, December 31st: TASS News Agency reports: The New York "Daily Worker" on December 29th published a summary of the report made by Hall, Secretary of the National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States, to the 15th National Convention of the Communist Party.

Hall said: Washington's aggressive policy is currently in crisis, and the world peace camp has caused serious setbacks and failures to the war camp. Hall said: The forces of peace are stronger than the forces of war.

Hall then emphasized that a climax of the people's movement to defend peace is growing in the United States. He said: The vast majority of people are calmly reconsidering the foreign policy of the United States and re-evaluating their attitude towards national leaders. Hall said: "Our country is in great turmoil and anxiety today. Our people are thinking about the chaotic state our country is in, and they are looking for a way out."

Hall reviewed the American aggression against Korea, saying: "It has only been six months since American imperialism entered a new stage in its efforts to enslave the world. But thousands of American men have already died in battle. Tens of thousands more have been permanently disabled and mutilated." The forces of American monopoly capitalists enslaving the world "have brought massacres, rapes, looting, and destruction to Korean families, and sorrow to American families."

In his conclusion, Hall put forward the following program for the national convention to consider: Intensify all efforts to mobilize the people to fight for the defense of peace; assist the masses in fighting against the harmful effects caused by the increase in the war economy—such as high rents, prices, and taxes, as well as the "speed-up system"; intensify the struggle to defend democracy, to oppose fascism, to oppose the reactionary Smith Act, the McCarran Anti-Communist Act, and other such legislation; make every effort to fight for the rights of black people, eradicate white chauvinism, and fight for the rights of black people to employment and housing; consolidate and strengthen the Communist Party.

The "Daily Worker" reported: In his report, Hall also reviewed the issues of trade unions, the struggle for black rights and national liberation, as well as the issues of youth, women, and peasants.

　　霍尔在美共全国会议上报告
    号召动员人民保卫和平
    【新华社三十一日讯】塔斯社讯：十二月二十九日纽约“工人日报”登载美国共产党全国委员会书记霍尔向共产党第十五次全国会议发表的报告的摘要。
    霍尔说：华盛顿侵略政策目前处于危机中，世界和平阵营已使战争阵营受到了严重的挫折和失败。霍尔说：和平力量比战争力量强大。
    霍尔接着强调民众保卫和平运动的高潮正在美国成长起来。他说：极大多数人民正在冷静地三思美国的外交政策，重新衡量对国家领袖们的态度。霍尔说：“我国今天处于极大的动乱和烦恼之中。我国人民在想着我国所处的混乱状态，他们在寻找出路。”
    霍尔检讨美国对朝鲜的侵略说：“自从美国帝国主义在奴役世界的努力中进入新阶段以来，刚过去六个月。但是已有成千的美国男儿战死了。还有成万的人终身残废、肢体不全了。”美国垄断资本家们奴役世界的势力，“为朝鲜家庭带来了大屠杀、奸淫掳掠和破坏，并且为美国家庭带来了悲哀。”
    霍尔在结语中提出下列纲领供全国会议考虑：加紧一切努力，动员人民为保卫和平而斗争；协助群众斗争反对增加战争经济而造成的有害的影响——如高昂的租金，物价和捐税以及“赶快制度”；加紧为保卫民主、为反对法西斯主义、为反对反动的史密斯法案、麦卡伦反共法及其他这类立法的斗争；作一切努力为黑人的权利而斗争、铲除白人的沙文主义、争取黑人就业和住房子的权利；巩固和加强共产党。
    “工人日报”报道：霍尔在他的报告中也检讨了工会问题、为黑人权利与民族解放而斗争的问题，以及青年、妇女和农民的问题。
