　　Reactions to Criticisms in the People's Daily
　　Beijing Electric Tram Company Cooperative – A Review of Cooperative Business – To a Comrade Reader:
　　Our cooperative sincerely accepts the opinions you raised about us in the People's Daily on January 5th. This represents a step forward in our understanding of cooperative policies and our management philosophy, enabling us to improve our work. We now reply to the several issues you mentioned as follows:
　　(1) The legally required daily cash reserve for our cooperative is 500,000 yuan. Because the cash from the day's sales is delivered by the three branches (the main branch and the north and south branches) too close to the bank's closing time, it is postponed to the next day for deposit. However, the bank can extend its hours for collections, and we failed to deposit it. There were also instances in October and November where 1.2 million yuan was retained as temporary working capital. These situations all demonstrate our neglect of the importance of national cash management.
　　(2) The use of blank checks has also occurred. We know that this does not comply with accounting procedures, but it is due to practical difficulties. For example, when purchasing goods from the municipal General Cooperative or state-owned companies, the total amount cannot be filled in beforehand because the quality and price of the goods are unknown. In the future, we will strive to complete the procedures as much as possible before issuing checks.
　　(3) The circumstances surrounding the payment of 660 jin of millet to the Tongxian Power Plant Cooperative and the reported loss of 300 jin of millet are as follows: In 1949, our cooperative purchased 660 jin of millet from the power plant cooperative and entrusted it to our North Branch for safekeeping. We repeatedly urged the power plant cooperative to take it back for disposal, but it was never resolved. Fearing that it would spoil over time, we mixed it with our cooperative's grain. At the time, our cooperative's accounting system was not sound, and we even listed the millet in the detailed inventory and sales ledger without filling in the amount. This demonstrates that our procedures were improper. The reported loss of 300 jin of millet in February 1950 was because our cooperative's inventory was not checked monthly, and this figure was the accumulated spoilage over several months.
　　(4) Contracting private merchants to process coal is not illegal, as there is a contract to prove it. Our cooperative's salesman, Yin Shuyu, engaged in the practice of extending credit to coal merchants to curry personal favor, and the general cadres also felt that since they were business partners, how could they refuse to extend some credit? This is a completely wrong idea, and it has now been corrected.
　　(5) On August 9, 1950, our cooperative's purchasing agent, Yang Zhaoqi, purchased 1,000 jin of Zunhua rice from the Grain Company on behalf of a private merchant, the Southern Sauce Garden, without the approval of the responsible person. His motive was to earn some money for the cooperative with this rice, which is a violation of the principles of cooperative economics. Yang has been transferred by the administrative department and ordered to engage in self-reflection.
　　Jiao Zonghan, the director of our cooperative, is careless in his work, did not conduct thorough and timely inspections, and lacked leadership. There was no good organizational plan within the cooperative, and discipline was lax, leading to these errors. In addition to a profound self-criticism by all staff members of our cooperative, we also request that the Beijing Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative General Office impose appropriate disciplinary action.
　　　　Beijing Electric Tram Workers Cooperative
　　　　　　January 11th
　　Editor's Note: After this newspaper published the letter "The Beijing Electric Tram Company Cooperative Should Be Rectified," we received many letters from the company's employees saying that their cooperative had never convened a general meeting of members or a meeting of member representatives since its establishment. Whenever the cooperative's cadres reported accounts, they always said they were losing money. And when salaries were deducted for goods purchased on credit, mistakes were frequently made; sometimes money was deducted even when no goods were purchased. People living in the cooperative (the warehouse is also a dormitory) do not have to pay for toothpaste, soap, towels, or cigarettes, so the item "goods damage" is particularly large at the end of the month. Other expenses are also quite alarming, such as the monthly bicycle repair fee, which amounts to tens of thousands of yuan. Based on these situations and the cooperative's letter of reply, we believe that this cooperative does not rely on its members and serve its members. In order to run this cooperative well, we hope that the cooperative will convene a general meeting of members or a meeting of member representatives, summarize past work, listen to the opinions of the members, and improve the cooperative's future work.
　　Letter from the Shanxi Provincial People's Court to the Editor:
　　The judgment on the Zhang Wenxiu case that I sent earlier, I think you have received. We have seen the "Judicial Workers Should Handle Mass Accusation Cases Quickly and Accurately" letter review published in the People's Daily's January 9th reader's letter column. Regarding the case of Zhang Wenxiu, the former director of the Changzhi Post Office, who abused his power and forced postal worker Wang Huichun to his death, we consulted with the Shanxi People's Procuratorate to determine how to handle it after we accepted it. This case should have been handled quickly and promptly, but it was delayed until January 4th of this year. The reason it was not handled in a timely manner was due to being busy with clearing counter-revolutionary cases and undertaking the work transfer of judges, which is indeed a fact; however, the main reason was bureaucratic leadership, which did not pay close attention to this case and did not supervise it.
　　We fully accept your criticism, and we are determined to pay attention to overcoming the phenomenon of delays in our future work.

### 对人民日报批评的反应

专栏：对人民日报批评的反应

　　对人民日报批评的反应
    京市电车公司合作社  对合作社业务的检讨一读者同志：
    本社诚恳接受你在元月五日人民日报上对我们提出的意见。这给本社对合作社政策的认识及对合作社的经营思想上是提高了一步，能够使我们工作有所改进。现将你所提到的几个问题答复如下：
    （一）本社每日法定库存款为五十万元，因三社（总社及南北分社）交来当日售货现金，距银行下班时间太近，故移在次日送缴。但银行是可以延长时间收款的，而我们亦未送缴；在十月十一月留用现金一二○万元作为临时流动资金的情况也是有过的。这些情况都说明了我们忽视国家管理现金的重要性。
    （二）使用空白支票的情况也是有的。我们知道这样做与会计手续是不符合的，但限于事实困难，如到市总社或国营公司批购货物，因事前不知货物的质量与价格，故总金额无法填写。今后当力求尽量争取手续完备后再开支票。
    （三）支付通县发电厂合作社小米六六○斤的经过及报亏损小米三○○斤的事情是这样的：本社曾于一九四九年代该厂合作社购得口小米六六○斤，交本社北分社代为保管。我们曾几次催该社领回处理，但迄未获得解决，因恐日久腐坏，因此混合在本社的粮食中。当时本社会计制度不够健全，竟将该项小米列在进销货明细帐内，也未填写金额。这说明我们在手续上是欠妥善的。一九五○年二月报亏损小米三○○斤是因为本社库存货物不是按月清典，此数是几个月累积下来的损耗数字。
    （四）批煤交私商加工，有合同证明，并不违法。本社业务员尹书钰曾有赊货给煤商拉拢私人关系的行为，而一般干部也认为既是往来商号，赊点货怎能拒绝呢？这完全是错误的思想，现在已经纠正了。
    （五）本社采购员杨兆起于一九五○年八月九日未通过负责人即在粮食公司代私商南方酱园批购遵化大米一千斤，其动机乃是想以此米为本社赚一些钱，这是违犯合作经济的原则错误。杨已由行政方面调走，令其进行反省。
    本社主任焦宗汉办事粗枝大叶，没有即时深入检查，领导不够，社内没有很好的组织计划，纪律也很松弛，以致造成此种错误。除本社全体工作人员应该深刻检讨外，并自请北京市供销合作总社给予应得的处分。
          北京电车工人合作社
            元月十一日
    编者按：本报发表了《北京市电车公司合作社应加整顿》的来信后，我们又曾收到该公司不少职工来信说他们的合作社自成立至今从未召开过一次社员大会或社员代表会议；合作社干部每逢报帐，总是说赔钱，而发薪扣除赊购品的价钱时，经常弄错，有时没有买东西也扣了钱；住在社内的人（仓库也是宿舍），用牙膏、肥皂、毛巾和抽烟自己都不用拿钱买，所以到月终结帐时，货物报损耗一项就特别大。其他各项开销也颇惊人，如每月修理自行车费就要几十万元。根据上述的这些情况及该社来信的答复，我们认为这个合作社不是依靠社员群众并为社员服务的。为了办好这个合作社，我们希望该社应召开社员大会或社员代表会议，总结以往的工作，倾听社员群众的意见，改进今后该社的工作。
  山西省人民法院来信编辑同志：
    前寄去关于张文秀案的判决，想已收到。我们对人民日报一月九日读者来信栏所载《司法工作者应迅速准确处理群众控诉案件》的来信述评，我们已经看到了。关于前长治邮局局长张文秀滥用职权逼死邮务员王惠春案，我们受理后，曾和山西人民检察署商好处理意见。此案本应迅速及时处理，但却延至今年一月四日才判决。因忙于清理反革命案件及承办审判员之工作调动，致影响此案及时处理，固是事实；但主要的原因是领导上的官僚主义，对此案抓的不紧，没有检查。
    我们完全接受你们的批评，并且决心在今后工作中注意克服拖延现象。
              山西省人民法院院长  支应遴
                副院长  傅贯一
          一九五一一月十九日
