　　The Relationship Between Proofreading and Editorial Work
    ——An Introduction to Soviet Collation Work
    Zhang Xichen
    The shortcomings of proofreading in our publications have become a matter of concern. Some advocate establishing a responsibility system for proofreaders, which is generally agreeable in principle. However, in reality, the prevalence of errors and omissions in publications cannot be entirely attributed to proofreaders, just as it cannot be entirely attributed to typesetters. Perhaps proofreaders are only responsible for 30% of these errors, while authors and editors of publishing houses should share the remaining 70%. Therefore, merely establishing a responsibility system for proofreaders is not enough; a responsibility system for authors and editors should also be effectively established. Here, I would like to introduce the Soviet system for reference by China's publishing industry.
    Soviet publishing houses adopt a very cautious attitude toward the publication of a book, not only rigorously reviewing the content but also taking great care in textual collation, without any negligence.
    The root of all errors in a book lies first in the original manuscript. Textual errors in the original manuscript can be roughly divided into seven categories: 1. Incorrect characters (in China, there are variant forms and simplified characters); 2. Inadvertent slips of the pen; 3. Errors in idioms, stories, and names of people, places, dates, etc., due to lack of verification; 4. Errors in quoted texts due to the use of indirect sources; 5. Errors in statistical data due to a lack of careful review; 6. Illegible handwriting; 7. Errors or ambiguities left after the original manuscript has been corrected and revised. No matter how famous the author, these types of errors are often difficult to completely avoid and can only be corrected after multiple careful reviews after completion. When receiving manuscripts, Soviet publishing houses first require authors to type or transcribe the original manuscript (at the expense of the publishing house), refusing to accept drafts with corrections. These typed or transcribed manuscripts have a specific format. Empty lines must be left between each line; the text must be written on the front of each sheet; and if other works are cited, the title, edition, publication year, volume number, and page number of the original book must be clearly indicated. After receiving the manuscript, the publishing house first has it reviewed by editors and external experts, who submit their respective review opinions. The chief editor then formulates a handling plan based on the review opinions and submits it to the director or editor-in-chief for approval. If it is deemed necessary for the author to revise the manuscript, the detailed revision guidelines are sent to the author along with the original manuscript. After the revision, it must still be transcribed in the same way. When it is deemed acceptable, the original manuscript is first sent to an assistant editor for collation. All citations, times, places, names, numbers, illustrations, etc., in the original manuscript must be checked against the original book. The editor then reviews the original manuscript, correcting erroneous words and punctuation marks one by one, and making appropriate corrections and embellishments to any inappropriate content or wording. This revised manuscript is then sent to the author for review and approval. If the author agrees with this revision, the revised manuscript is typed or copied in duplicate, proofread, and signed jointly by the author and the editor before one copy is sent for typesetting.
    After typesetting, the printing house must print three copies of the galley proof, one for the publishing house's proofreader, and one for the author to proofread themselves. The publishing house's proofreading must be reviewed by several people, each using a different color of ink for corrections. Proofreaders cannot change the original manuscript; if they have any questions, they must add a symbol and ask the editor to decide. After the author's proof is returned, the two copies are sent to the editor for review. If the editor believes that the author's proofreading is inappropriate, they can make corrections, but must notify the author and explain the reasons. The proofreader then transcribes the corrected text from the two proofs, using the various symbols used in proofreading, onto the third uncorrected proof and submits it to the printing house for correction. With such precisely corrected proofs, typesetters are less likely to make mistakes when revising the typeset. Therefore, the second proof sent can be signed by the author, and if there are only a few errors, the printing house can be responsible for correcting them. This final proof must be signed by the author, the editor, and then countersigned by the editor-in-chief. If the book has many illustrations or tables, the printing house must send proofs three times. The first proof is a long strip without page layout. After correction, it must be sent to the technical editor to determine the page margins and the position of illustrations, tables, and captions, and then sent to the printing house for page layout and proofing.
    Soviet authors are obligated to proofread their own works under the contract they sign with the publishing house, and the publishing house does not pay proofreading fees; the deadline for completing proofreading is also clearly stipulated in the contract according to the amount of content in the manuscript. Furthermore, the law stipulates that authors cannot modify the original manuscript on the proof; if too many modifications are made, the author must bear the resulting increase in typesetting costs.
    Comparing the Soviet system with the situation in China's publishing industry, it is not surprising that errors often occur in our publications. First, the original manuscripts received by our publishers from authors are often illegible and full of corrections, making it impossible for both typesetters and proofreaders/editors to understand. The work of transcription is rarely done. Second, small-scale publishers not only lack editorial departments, but even lack proofreaders, sending such illegible and confused manuscripts directly to the printing house to be responsible for typesetting and proofreading. Third, even larger publishers, although they do some revision of the original manuscript, rarely transcribe it again after revision, and even more rarely send it back to the author for review. Sometimes, errors are added due to revision, even if the original manuscript had no errors. Fourth, publishing houses with proofreading departments often regard proofreading as the sole responsibility of the proofreader, and editors rarely intervene. Fifth, proofreading is considered the easiest task, and general proofreaders lack sufficient literacy and professional skills. Sixth, although a few publishers know to pay attention to proofreading, they mostly only do several repeated revisions on the proof and never carefully organize and collate the original manuscript from the beginning. Even if there are fewer typos in the publication (and sometimes errors occur due to too much proofreading), the delay in publication time and the increase in editing and typesetting costs result in huge losses.
    Due to the limitations of the overall publishing conditions, we certainly cannot achieve the Soviet method all at once, but the spirit of seriousness and meticulousness of the Soviet writers, editors, and proofreaders is something we should and must learn. In order to reduce errors in books, we hope that: (1) Writers will try their best to write the original manuscript clearly, review it at least once before submitting it, and check the cited materials; (2) Every publishing house should establish its own editorial department and increase the number of highly qualified proofreaders as much as possible; (3) Improve the professional and political level of existing editors and proofreaders.

　　校对工作与编著工作的关系
    ——介绍苏联的校勘工作
    章锡琛
    我国出版物校勘工作的缺点，已经成为大家注意的问题。有人主张建立校对员的负责制度，这在原则上大家都可以同意的。但是在事实上，现在出版物上错误脱漏的所以“俯拾即是”，不能完全归咎于校对工作者，正和不能完全归咎于排字工人一样。这种错误的责任，也许校对者只能负百分之三十，其中百分之七十，应该由著作人和出版社的编审人员共同担负。所以仅仅建立校对工作者的负责制度还嫌不够，应该把著作人和编审人员的负责制度切实建立起来。这里我想介绍苏联的制度，以供我国出版界的参考。
    苏联的出版社，对于一本书的出版，不但在编辑的内容上须要经过严密的审订，就是在文字的校勘上，也抱着十分慎重的态度，不肯丝毫疏忽。
    书中一切错误的根源，首先是原稿。原稿的错误，专就文字上说，大约可以分为七类：１、别字（在中国，有异体字、简笔字）；２、不经意的笔误；３、成语故事及人地名时日等因未经查考而发生的错误；４、引证文字采用间接的材料而发生的错误；５、统计数字一类的资料，因没有经过仔细的复核而发生的错误；６、书写潦草，无法辨认；７、原稿经过修正涂改，留下误字或模糊不清。无论怎样著名的作家，这类错误，往往难以完全避免，只有在脱稿以后，经过多次的仔细复阅，才能加以改正。苏联出版社在收稿的时候，首先要求著作人把原稿打字或誊正（费用归出版社担负），拒绝接受涂改的草稿。这种打字或誊正的原稿，都有一定的格式。每行之间，须留出空行；文字都须写在每张纸的正面；如果有引用别人著作的，须把原书的名称、版本、出版年月以及引文所在的卷数、页码等一一注明。出版社接到原稿以后，先由编辑及社外的专家审查，分别提出审查意见，然后由主任编辑根据审查意见拟具处理办法，送请社长或总编辑批准。如果认为尚须请著作人重行修改的，就把修改的详细方针连同原稿送交著作人。修改以后，仍须照样誊正。到了认为可以接受的时候，先把原稿发交助理编辑整理，凡原稿中引用他书以及时、地、人名、数字、插图等，都须检出原书，一一核对，再由编辑复阅原稿，把错误的字句、标点符号逐一改正，内容或文字上有不妥善的，加以适当的订正和润饰。以后仍把这份修订稿送请著作人复阅，征得他的同意。如果著作人同意这种修订，再把这份修订稿打字或复印两份，经过校对，由著作人和编辑共同签字，才把其中的一份发排。
    排成以后，印刷所须把排样印出三份，一份由出版社的校对员校对，一份送著作人自己校对。出版社的校对，须经几人的复校，每人用颜色不同的墨水校改。校对员不能改动原稿，如果认为有疑问，须另加符号记出，请编辑决定。等到著作人的校样送还以后，把两份校样送编辑复阅。如果认为著作人的校对不妥，可加以改正，但须通知著作人，并说明理由。这样才由校对员把两份校样改出的文字，用校对上使用的各种符号转录在第三份未经校过的排样上，交印刷所改正。经过这样精密校改的校样，排字工人改版时，便很少会发生错误。所以在第二次印成送来的校样，就可以由著作人签字，如果有少数的错误，可以由印刷所负责改正。这最后的校样，经著作人签字外，并须由编辑签字，再请总编辑加签。倘使插图或表格较多的书，印刷所须送排样三次。第一次的排样，是没有拼版的长条。校正以后，须送技术编辑划定版口和装图表及图注的位置，再交印刷所装版送校。
    苏联的著作人，在与出版社订立的合同上，负有校对自己著作的义务，出版社不必付给校对费；校对完成的期限，也按照稿件内容的份量在合同上有着明文规定。并且法令上规定著作人在校样上不能修改原稿，如果修改过多，因此增加的排版费用，须由著作人负担。
    把苏联的制度和我国出版界的情形一加比较，便可知道我们出版物常常发生校勘上的错误，是毫不足怪的事情。第一、我们的出版家从著作人收到的原稿，往往是字迹潦草，涂改满纸，不但排字人无法辨认，便是校对员编辑员也往往看不懂，誊正的工作是很少有人做的。第二、小规模的出版家，不但没有编辑部，甚至连校对员都没有，只把这种潦草胡涂的原稿，直接发交印刷所去负责排校。第三、即使规模较大的出版家，对原稿也经过一番修订的工作，但是修订以后，既然很少另行誊正，更绝少再送著作人复阅。有时原稿并没错误，反因修订而增加错误。第四、设有校对部的出版家，多把校对工作认为完全是校对员的责任，编辑人员往往不加过问。第五、把校对工作认为最容易的工作，一般的校对员文字修养和业务修养都不够。第六、少数的出版家，对于校对工作虽然知道注意，大都只从校样上做几次重复修改的工作，从来不肯在最初的原稿上加以精心的整理缮校，即使出版物的错字较少（有时反会因校改的太多而发生错误），然而出版时间的耽误，编辑排校费用的增加，却造成了巨大的损失。
    由于整个出版条件的限制，苏联的办法我们固然不可能一下子做到，但是苏联那种从作家、编辑到校对工作者的认真负责，丝毫不苟的精神是我们应该学习而且是必须学习的。为了减少书籍上的错误，我们希望：（一）作家尽量把原稿写得清楚一些，在稿件寄出之前，无论如何要复看一遍，并把所引证的材料加以查对；（二）每一个出版社，应建立自己的编辑部，并尽可能增设水平较高的校对人员；（三）提高现有的编辑人员及校对人员的业务水平及政治水平。
