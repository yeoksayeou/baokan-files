　　Beijing Christian Groups Gather to Establish Committee to Defend Peace and Oppose Aggression
　　Issue Declaration Endorsing Government Administration Council Decision, Call on All Churches and Church Organizations to Formulate Plans to Implement Self-Governance, Self-Support, and Self-Propagation.
    (Xinhua News Agency, 28th) Beijing Christian figures held a meeting today to establish the "Beijing Christian Groups Committee to Defend World Peace and Oppose American Aggression." The meeting was presided over by the North China Christian Joint Committee and the Beijing Christian Joint Committee. More than 130 people attended, including heads and representatives of various Christian associations, churches, schools, and hospitals in Beijing. Chen Qiyuan, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government, He Chengxiang, Director of the Religious Affairs Department of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Central People's Government, and Dong Ruqin, Director of the Civil Affairs Bureau of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, were invited to attend and speak.
    Jiang Changchuan, Bishop of the North China Christian Joint Committee and chairman of the meeting, began by saying: Today, human society is divided into two major camps, one is the peace camp and the other is the aggression camp. The peace camp is expanding, and the aggression camp is declining. The entire spirit of Christian doctrine is to defend peace and oppose aggression. Christian figures in North China and Beijing resolutely support the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council's "Decision on Handling Cultural and Educational, Relief Organizations, and Religious Groups Accepting American Subsidies," and will take practical actions to implement the self-governance, self-support, and self-propagation reform movement. To this end, we must strengthen unity, work together, and strive forward. The "Beijing Christian Groups Committee to Defend World Peace and Oppose American Aggression" was established based on this purpose.
    Chen Qiyuan, He Chengxiang, and Dong Ruqin, in their speeches, unanimously emphasized the great significance of this reform movement in Chinese Christianity and expressed their sincere hope that Christian figures in Beijing and across the country would make greater efforts on the basis of existing achievements.
    Wang Zizhong, General Secretary of the North China Christian Joint Committee, Pang Zhikun, Chairman of the Beijing Christian Joint Committee, and Christian representative Ling Ruiqin spoke in succession. Wang Zizhong, on behalf of Christian believers in the North China region, stated: (1) In the future, we must actively participate in all work for the motherland; (2) We must resolutely sever ties with imperialism so that the church can truly become an independent and autonomous church of the Chinese people. Pang Zhikun believes that the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council's decision on handling cultural and educational, relief organizations, and religious groups accepting American subsidies has provided strong support for the reform movement of Christianity. He stated that in the future, they must firmly stand on the position of the Chinese people and strive to defend world peace and oppose American imperialist aggression. Ling Ruiqin, representing Christian youth, expressed her determination to resist America, aid Korea, protect the family, and defend the country. She said: We must spread the message of peace to every corner and use all our strength to defend our great and lovable motherland and defend world peace.
    Finally, the representatives unanimously passed the Beijing Christian Groups Declaration Endorsing the Government Administration Council Decision, and elected Jiang Changchuan (Methodist Church), Ling Xianyang (Chinese Anglican Church), Shao Fengyuan (Church of Christ in China), Wei Zhenyu, Pang Zhikun (North China Congregational Church), Zhou Weitong (Far Eastern Gospel Crusade), Zhang Boqing (Seventh-day Adventist Church), Guan Bide (Assemblies of God), Wang Yunsheng (Holy City New Church), Zhou Fugeng (Chinese Bible Society), Gao Shangren (Beijing YMCA), Yu Xiu'ai (Beijing YWCA), Lu Zhiwei, Zhao Zichen (Yanjing University), Li Buqing (Beijing Theological Seminary), Wang Zizhong (United Women's Theological Seminary), and 58 others as members of the committee, and elected Jiang Changchuan, Lu Zhiwei, Zhao Zichen, and 27 others as standing committee members.
    (Xinhua News Agency, 28th) The inaugural meeting of the Beijing Christian Groups Committee to Defend World Peace and Oppose American Aggression issued the "Beijing Christian Groups Declaration Endorsing the Government Administration Council Decision," the full text of which is as follows:
    We, the Christian churches and Christian groups in Beijing, warmly endorse the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council's "Decision on Handling Cultural and Educational, Relief Organizations, and Religious Groups Accepting American Subsidies," and are willing to immediately formulate specific plans with the greatest enthusiasm and effort to achieve the goal of self-governance, self-support, and self-propagation of the Chinese Christian Church under the encouragement of the People's Government.
    For more than 20 years, although the Chinese Christian Church has made some progress in the Three-Self Patriotic Movement due to the efforts of advanced church figures, most churches and church groups still depend on the financial support of foreign churches, especially American churches, and are therefore restricted by foreign churches, especially American churches, in their missionary work and internal administration. Today, we realize that the Chinese Christian Church could not truly have freedom and could not truly achieve self-governance and self-propagation in the era of reactionary rule.
    The victory of the people's revolution liberated the people of the whole country from the rule and oppression of imperialism and reactionaries. The Chinese people have stood up from now on, and we Chinese Christians must also stand up from now on. The "Path of Endeavor for Chinese Christianity in the Construction of New China" declaration has been warmly supported by Christians across the country, and correctly reflects our patriotic enthusiasm, our national self-esteem and self-confidence, and our determination to achieve church self-governance, self-support, and self-propagation. However, due to our long-term economic dependence on foreign churches in the past, our national self-esteem and self-confidence have often been paralyzed by American dollars. Now, the Government Administration Council's decision truly helps us Christians and Christian churches to get rid of our long-term material and spiritual dependence on foreign churches and stand up on our own. Therefore, we realize that the victory of the people's revolution has also liberated the Chinese Christian Church, making it possible for us to achieve the goal of church self-governance, self-support, and self-propagation that believers across the country have long desired. Therefore, we sincerely thank and endorse this decision of the Government Administration Council.
    Most of the foreign subsidies accepted by our churches and church groups come from the United States. Although there are well-intentioned American Christians who genuinely wish to help the Chinese Christian Church, due to the close relationship between some leaders of the American church and the reactionary ruling class of the United States, these aids are objectively manipulated and used directly and indirectly by American imperialism to cover up American imperialist aggression, obscure our understanding of the nature of American imperialist aggression, and paralyze our will to carry out the anti-imperialist struggle. Austin's shameless lies have exposed the fact that American imperialism uses religion to carry out aggressive conspiracies.
    After suffering a disastrous defeat in the war of aggression against Korea, American imperialism brazenly announced the freezing of our public and private property in the United States and cut off remittances, thereby threatening all cultural, educational, relief organizations, and religious groups that accept American subsidies. This measure by American imperialism only makes us Christians more deeply aware of its true face, makes us more vigilant, and we will never bow to the threat of American imperialism, and we will never be directly or indirectly utilized by American imperialism in any way.
    For the sake of loving our country and loving our church, we must implement the Government Administration Council's decision with the greatest determination. We call on all churches and church groups in Beijing: (1) Seriously study the Government Administration Council's decision, and formulate plans for self-governance, self-support, and self-propagation based on the specific situation of each church and church group, and strive to achieve them in the shortest possible time; (2) Raise vigilance to prevent any activities that attempt to use the church for counter-revolutionary activities; (3) Establish the Beijing Christian and Christian Groups Committee to Defend World Peace and Oppose American Aggression to lead colleagues and comrades in various churches to launch current affairs studies, promote the spirit of patriotism, stand on the position of patriotic people, and actively participate in the great patriotic movement of resisting America, aiding Korea, protecting the family, and defending the country.

　　北京基督教团体集会
　  成立保卫和平反对侵略委员会
    发表宣言拥护政务院决定，号召各教会和教会团体拟定计划，实行自治自养自传。                  
    【新华社二十八日讯】北京基督教会人士今日举行会议，成立“北京基督教团体保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会”。会议由华北基督教联合会及北京基督教联合会主持。到会有北京基督教各会、堂、学校、医院负责人及教徒代表一百三十余人。中央人民政府内务部副部长陈其瑗、中央人民政府文化教育委员会宗教事务处处长何成湘、北京市人民政府民政局长董汝勤应邀出席讲话。
    会议主席华北基督教联合会会督江长川首先致词称：今日人类社会中分两大阵营，一是和平阵营，一是侵略阵营。和平阵营日益扩大，侵略阵营日益衰落。基督教义整个精神就是保卫和平，反对侵略。华北和北京市的基督教人士坚决拥护中央人民政府政务院《关于处理接受美国津贴的文化教育、救济机关及宗教团体的方针的决定》，以实际行动来贯彻自治、自养、自传的革新运动。为此，必须加强团结，合力同心，努力前进。“北京基督教团体保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会”，就是基于这样的宗旨成立的。
    陈其瑗、何成湘、董汝勤讲话时，一致强调中国基督教这次革新运动的重大意义，热切地希望北京市及全国的基督教人士在已有的成绩基础上，作更大的努力。
    华北基督教联合会总干事王梓仲、北京基督教联合会主席庞之焜及教徒代表凌瑞琴相继讲话。王梓仲代表华北区基督教徒表示：（一）今后对祖国的工作，事事要积极参加；（二）坚决斩断与帝国主义的联系，使教会真正成为中国人民独立自主的教会。庞之焜认为中央人民政府政务院关于处理接受美国津贴的文化教育、救济机关及宗教团体的方针的决定，对基督教的革新运动作了有力的支持。他表示今后要坚定地站在中国人民的立场，为保卫世界持久和平，为反对美帝国主义的侵略而努力。凌瑞琴代表基督教青年表示抗美援朝保家卫国的决心，她说：我们要把和平的信息传达到每一个角落，要用一切力量来保卫我们伟大可爱的祖国，保卫世界和平。
    最后到会代表一致通过了北京基督教团体拥护政务院决定宣言，并选出江长川（卫理公会）、凌贤扬（中华圣公会）、邵凤元（中华基督教会）、魏振玉、庞之焜（华北公理会）、周维同（远东宣教会）、张伯清（安息日会）、关彼德（神召会）、王云生（圣城新教会）、周扶耕（中华圣经会）、高尚仁（北京基督教青年会）、俞秀蔼（北京基督教女青年会）、陆志韦、赵紫宸（燕京大学）、李步青（北京神学院）、王梓仲（联合女子圣道学院）等五十八人为委员，并选江长川、陆志韦、赵紫宸等二十七人为常务委员。
    【新华社二十八日讯】北京基督教团体保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会成立大会，发表《北京基督教团体拥护政务院决定宣言”，全文如下：
    我们北京各基督教会与基督教团体热烈拥护中央人民政府政务院《关于处理接受美国津贴的文化教育、救济机关及宗教团体的方针的决定》，并愿以最大的热诚和努力，立即拟订具体计划，在人民政府鼓励下，实现中国基督教会自治自养自传的目标。
    二十余年来，中国基督教会虽然由于教会先进人士的努力，三自运动有一些成绩。但仍有大部分教会及教会团体依赖于外国教会尤其是美国教会的经费维持，因此在传教事业与内部行政上受到外国教会尤其是美国教会的限制。今天我们觉悟到：在反动统治时代，中国基督教会是不可能真正有自由的，是不可能真正自治自传的。
    人民大革命的胜利，从帝国主义和反动派统治压迫下解放了全国人民，中国人民从此站起来了，我们中国基督徒也要从此站起来了。《中国基督教在新中国建设中努力的途径》宣言，受到全国基督徒的热烈拥护，是正确地反映了我们的爱国热诚，我们的民族自尊与自信以及教会自治自养自传的决心，但由于过去长期在经济上倚赖外国教会，使我们的民族自尊心与自信心时常被美金麻痹了。现在政务院的决定，真正帮助了我们基督徒和基督教会摆脱长期对外国教会的物质与精神的倚赖，自己站立起来。因此我们认识到人民大革命的胜利也解放了中国基督教会，使我们有可能达到全国信徒所久已愿望的教会自治自养自传的目标。因此我们以至诚感谢和拥护政务院这个决定。
    我们各教会与教会团体所接受的外国津贴大部来自美国。其中虽有美国善意基督徒确有帮助中国基督教会的愿望，但由于美国教会一部分领袖与美国反动统治阶级的密切关系，使这些援助在客观上都被美帝国主义直接、间接操纵利用，以掩盖美帝侵略，模糊我们对美帝侵略本质的认识，麻痹我们进行反帝斗争的意志。奥斯汀的无耻谰言正说穿了美帝利用宗教进行侵略阴谋的事实。
    而美帝在侵略朝鲜战争惨败后，竟悍然宣布冻结我国在美公私财产，断绝汇兑，以此威胁所有接受美国津贴的文化教育、救济机关及宗教团体的事工。美帝国主义的这种措施，只有使我们基督徒更深刻地认识它的真面目，使我们更提高警惕，决不在美帝国主义威胁下低头，决不受美帝国主义任何直接间接的利用。
    为了爱国，为了爱我们的教会，我们要以最大的决心贯彻政务院决定，我们号召全北京市各教会与教会团体：（一）认真学习政务院的决定，并根据各教会与教会团体的具体情况，拟定自治自养自传的计划，争取在最短期间促其实现；（二）提高警惕，防止任何企图利用教会进行反革命的活动；（三）成立北京基督教与基督教团体保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会，领导各教会同工同道，展开时事学习，发扬爱国主义精神，站在爱国人民的立场，积极参加抗美援朝保家卫国这一伟大爱国运动。
