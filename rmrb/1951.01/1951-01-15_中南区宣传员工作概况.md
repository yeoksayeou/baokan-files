Propaganda Work

　　Overview of Propaganda Work in the Central South Region
    Xia Duan
    I. General Situation
    Since the Central South Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) focused on Hubei Province in March of last year and called on the entire region to establish propagandists, the Propaganda Department of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the CPC immediately began focusing on pilot projects in counties such as Nanzhang and Xiangyang. Subsequently, Jiangxi in Xingan County and Henan in Yu County also began this work. After the Central Committee put forward the establishment of propagandists in the instructions for the peace signature campaign, various places further recognized the necessity of establishing propaganda teams; Guangzhou established propagandists during the peace signature campaign. All regions that have established propagandists have recognized the benefits of establishing propagandists from practical work; some places have also begun preparations or started to establish them. However, this is still the case in a small number of cities and counties, and the entire region needs to vigorously carry out this work.
    Currently, there are approximately 4,000 propagandists in the entire region. According to materials from Guangzhou, Yu County, Nanzhang, Xingan and other places, the composition of propagandists in urban areas is primarily teachers and students, followed by workers, and then office staff, housewives, and old artists. In rural areas, the composition is primarily peasant activists (mostly poor peasants, followed by middle peasants), followed by teachers and students.
    (Editor's note: The composition of propagandists should be adjusted in accordance with the central decision, which points out that "labor models and other revolutionary activists among Party members, Communist Youth League members, and people's masses around the branch who voluntarily engage in propaganda work under the leadership of the Party should be selected as propagandists.")
    II. Qualifications of Propagandists
    The qualifications for propagandists stipulated by various places are roughly as follows: (1) politically pure, with the necessary political awareness; (2) lead by example, connect with the masses, and have a certain prestige among the masses; (3) have a certain ability to propagandize. In rural areas, there is generally an additional requirement: good class background (Nanzhang County specifically stipulates poor, hired, and middle peasant class background). In addition, some propose that they should have a proper style and a certain level of education. Experience has shown that the most basic of these conditions are the first two. However, in implementation, some places have not paid attention to grasping these basic conditions and have indiscriminately absorbed people; some places have inappropriately emphasized education, so that worker and peasant activists are kept out, while politically unreliable elements take the opportunity to sneak in and carry out activities. These are all inappropriate.
    (Editor's note: The conditions for selecting propagandists should be in accordance with the central regulations: have the necessary political awareness, lead by example in production labor and other work, connect with the masses, and have the appropriate ability to engage in propaganda work.)
    III. Methods for Developing Propagandists
    (1) Discover and absorb activists as propagandists during movements. Guangzhou established propagandists during the peace signature campaign, and some counties in Hubei and Guangdong established propagandists during the grain requisition movement. This method makes it easier to discover activists in the work and can be used as the main method for developing propagandists, but it is necessary to prevent the phenomenon of indiscriminate acceptance of all comers. It is said that this phenomenon has occurred in some places and needs to be corrected urgently.
    (2) Discover and absorb propagandists in various training classes. Propagandists in Anlu County, Hubei, were first discovered in land reform training classes and teacher training classes, and then developed after a period of propaganda work testing; some counties were developed through district and township cadre training classes. The advantage of this method is that it has undergone careful understanding and testing and is relatively reliable. They can be used as the backbone and core members of propagandists, and they can be used to expand the propaganda team.
    (3) Discover and absorb propagandists in daily work. Currently, various places are using these two methods: one is administrative hosting, public recommendation by the masses, personal consent, and approval or commission by the leading organ. This is how Zhengzhou Railway Bureau and a certain district in Qingjiang, Jiangxi, developed propagandists. The other is individual discovery by the Party branch committee, personal consent, and approval by the branch secretary; some continue to cultivate the selected object for a period of time before absorbing them as propagandists. This is also a relatively good method.
    (4) First mobilize Party members to be propagandists within the Party, as the backbone, and then develop them among the masses. Such as Taojiawan in Nanzhang County.
    These several methods and ways of developing propagandists are all feasible as long as the leadership is appropriate. However, it is necessary to adhere to the two principles of developing propagandists: individual voluntariness and organizational approval. Therefore, the method of automatically registering, which involves large-scale indiscriminate acceptance beforehand and large-scale screening afterwards, troubling oneself and offending others; or mobilizing the masses for democratic elections (Nanzhang Chengguan District); or designation by township cadres (a certain district in Xingan County) and other methods do not conform to these two principles.
    (Editor's note: Various places can adopt various methods to discover suitable candidates for propagandists; but in the end, they must become propagandists in accordance with the procedures stipulated by the Central Committee, that is: they should be reviewed and approved by the Party branch committee and approved by a higher-level Party organization.)
    IV. Organization, Leadership, and Activities of Propagandists
    Various places have the following three ways of leading propagandists: (1) Led by the Propaganda and Education Committee under the leadership of the Party. The Propaganda and Education Committee is composed of Party and League propaganda committee members, township cadres, farmers' associations, women, militia, and teachers. This can concentrate the strength of mass organizations and cooperate in combat under the unified command of the Party; some are composed mainly of intellectuals, such as the Propaganda and Education Committee of Huashi Township, Yu County, which is composed of teachers (including one League branch secretary), students, farmer association group leaders, and chamber of commerce group leaders, which is inappropriate; some are composed of leaders of various propaganda groups, directly leading the work of propagandists; another is the district propaganda and education joint association composed of the district party secretary and district propaganda and education committee member as the director and deputy director and the district government, civil education hall and various agencies, schools and groups to conduct business guidance. (2) The Henan Provincial Committee of the CPC stipulates that it should be led directly by the branch or district committee; however, when necessary, each branch may also absorb the heads of propaganda departments of the Communist Youth League and other groups to form a propaganda committee to guide and promote this work. (3) The Party directly leads and appears publicly in the name of the Party's propagandist, such as Taojiawan in Nanzhang. The first form of organization and leadership does not clearly stipulate the direct leadership of the Party committee, so it is only suitable for leading propagandists of mass organizations. The Party's propagandists must be directly led by the Party committee organizationally and politically. The common point of these three forms of organization and leadership is that propagandists are divided into groups according to production units or residential areas, which facilitates the propagandists to accept leadership and connect with the masses. The organization of propagandists in individual cities is divided into groups, squads, platoons, and battalions according to different social strata, forming a systematic organization, and the city is unified by a joint working committee composed of the Grand Federation and the Anti-American Aggression Committee, and leaders are self-selected at all levels. This organizational leadership form with many levels and many systems is inappropriate. (Editor's note: Propagandists should be unifiedly led by the Party.)
    The activities of propagandists are relatively simple in rural areas, mainly oral propaganda (talking, rooftop broadcasting, reading newspapers), and supplemented by publishing blackboard newspapers, painting, etc. In cities and towns, it is more diverse. In addition to oral propaganda, there are organized listening to broadcasts, communication reports, plays, painting, publishing wall newspapers, writing letters, and holding discussion meetings. Propagandists who can persuade others have one common condition, that is, they are consistent in word and deed and lead by example.
    V. Effectiveness of Propagandist Work
    Propagandists in various places have played a certain role in production and work. In Guangzhou, propagandists organized 482,112 people to sign for peace in one month. In Tonglin Township, Qingjiang County, Jiangxi, farmers were worried about land reclamation, but after the propagandists explained it, 150 mu of land were reclaimed, ranking first in the district. Luo Dequan, a propagandist in Chengguan Town, Nanzhang, made the households who concealed land automatically report the concealed land. In individual areas, the masses call the propagandists "advisers." They said: "With propagandists, the people can know a lot more things. In the past, many things were confused." When they encounter things they don't understand, they say: "Ask the propagandist, they will know."
    VI. Current Problems
    (1) Many local cadres do not have a sufficient understanding of the significance of establishing propagandists, so they are afraid that "developing production activists into propagandists will hinder production"; or "there is no manpower to do it." They do not know that establishing propagandists is to increase manpower. Such erroneous understandings must be corrected urgently, otherwise the work of propagandists cannot be carried out.
    (2) The propaganda agencies at the county and district levels are not sound, so no one is responsible for developing propagandists; or after they are developed, no one leads them, and they collapse again.
    (3) After the propagandists are established, there is an urgent need to improve their propaganda ability and provide them with propaganda materials. A propagandist in Yu County, Henan, reflected: "We are all willing to be propagandists, but we can't sell anything because we can't buy goods, especially the lack of current affairs propaganda materials."

　　中南区宣传员工作概况
    夏端
    一、一般情况
    自去年三月中共中央中南局宣传部以湖北省为重点，并向全区号召建立宣传员以后，中共湖北省委宣传部即在南漳、襄阳等县开始了重点试建工作。此后江西在新淦县。河南在禹县，也开始进行这一工作。在中央在和平签名运动指示中提出建立宣传员以后，各地进一步认识到建立宣传队伍的必要；广州就在和平签名运动中建立了宣传员。所有建立了宣传员的地区，都从实际工作中认识了建立宣传员的好处；有些地方，也开始准备或着手建立。但这仍是少数市、县是这样作，全区需要大力开展这一工作。
    现全区约有宣传员四千余人。宣传员的成份，据广州、禹县、南漳、新淦等地材料来看，在城镇首为教员、学生，次为工人，余为机关职员、家庭妇女、旧艺人等。在乡村首为农民积极分子（贫农占多数，中农次之），次为教员、学生。
    （编者按：宣传员的成分应按照中央决定中指出的：“应当挑选党员、青年团员和支部周围的人民群众中自愿在党的领导下担任宣传工作的劳动模范和其他革命积极分子担任宣传员”的原则进行调整。）
    二、宣传员的条件
    各地所规定的宣传员条件大体有以下几条：（一）政治上纯洁，具有必要的政治觉悟；（二）以身作则，联系群众，在群众中有一定威信；（三）有一定的宣传能力。农村大抵还加上一条：成份好（南漳县具体规定为贫、雇、中农成份）。此外有提出要作风正派的；要有一定文化程度的。经验证明：这些条件中最基本的是第一、二两条。但是在执行中，有的地方并没有注意掌握这些基本条件，滥加吸收；有的地方不适当的强调文化程度，以致把工农积极分子关在门外，政治上不可靠的分子反得乘机混进来，进行活动。这都是不妥当的。
    （编者按：选择宣传员的条件应当按照中央所规定的：有必要的政治觉悟，在生产劳动和其他工作中以身作则，联系群众，并有担任宣传工作的适当能力等项为准。）
    三、宣传员的发展方法
    （一）在运动中物色和吸收积极分子为宣传员。广州在和平签名运动中，湖北和广东某些县在征粮运动中都建立了宣传员。这种方法比较容易发现工作中的积极分子，可作为发展宣传员的主要方法，但要防止来者不拒的滥收现象。据说此种现象已在某些地方发生了，急须纠正。
    （二）在各种训练班中物色和吸收宣传员。湖北安陆县的宣传员是先在土改训练班和教师训练班中物色好，而后经过一段宣传工作的考验发展的；有的县是经过区乡干部训练班发展的。这种方法的好处是经过了慎重的了解与考验，比较可靠，可以把他们作为宣传员的骨干和核心分子，通过他们去扩大宣传队伍。
    （三）在日常工作中物色和吸收宣传员。现在各地采用这两种方式：一是行政主持，群众公推，本人同意，领导机关批准或加委的方式，郑州铁路局和江西清江某区就是这样发展宣传员的。二是党的支委个别物色，本人同意，支书批准；有的在选定对象后，再继续培养一个时期才吸收为宣传员的。这也是比较好的方法。
    （四）先在党内动员党员做宣传员，做为骨干，然后在群众中发展。如南漳县陶家湾。
    这几种发展宣传员的方法、方式，只要领导得当，都是可行的。但必须坚持发展宣传员的两个原则：个人自愿与组织批准。因此，事前大批滥收，事后大批洗刷，麻烦自己又得罪别人的自动报名即可的方法；或发动群众民主选举（南漳城关区）；或乡干指定（新淦县某区）等方法，都不符合这两个原则的。
    （编者按：各地可以采用多种多样的方式来物色适当的对象担任宣传员；但最后必须按照中央规定的手续，即：应当经过党的支部委员会的审查通过和高一级党组织的批准，才能成为宣传员。）
    四、宣传员的组织领导与活动方式
    各地对宣传员的领导方式有以下三种：（一）由党领导下的宣教委员会领导。宣教委员会有以党、团宣委、乡干、农会、妇女、民兵、教员组成的，这样能够集中群众团体的力量，在党的统一指挥下配合作战；也有以知识分子为主组成的，如禹县花石乡宣教委员会是由教员（内一名是团支书）、学生、农会组长和商会组长组成，这是不恰当的；有的是由各宣传小组组长组成，直接领导宣传员工作；另以区委书记及区宣教委员任正副主任和区政府，民教馆及各机关、学校、团体组成的区宣教联合会进行业务指导。（二）中共河南省委规定，由支部或区委直接领导；但是必要时各支部还可吸收青年团及其它团体的宣传部门负责人组成宣传委员会来指导与推动这一工作。（三）党直接领导，公开以党的宣传员名义出现，如南漳陶家湾。第一种组织领导形式没有明确规定党委直接领导，所以只适用于领导群众团体的宣传员。党的宣传员在组织上与政治上是必须受党委直接领导的。这三种组织领导形式的共同点是宣传员按生产单位或住区划分小组，便于宣传员接受领导和联系群众。有个别城市宣传员的组织，是按不同社会阶层分成小组、小队、中队、大队各成系统的组织，全市统归和大分会与反美侵略委员会合组的联合工委会来领导，各级自选负责人。这种层次多，系统多的组织领导形式是不适当的。（编者按：宣传员应由党统一领导。）
    宣传员的活动方式在农村比较单纯，口头宣传（谈话、屋顶广播、读报）为主，出版黑板报、绘画等为副。在城镇比较多样，除口头宣传外，有组织收听广播、通讯报道、演戏、绘画、出壁报、写信、召开讨论会等。凡能说服别人的宣传员，都有一个共同的条件，就是言行一致，以身作则。
    五、宣传员工作的效果
    各地宣传员在生产和工作中起了一定的作用。广州市宣传员在一月之内就组织了四八二、一一二人进行和平签名。江西清江县桐林乡农民对开荒有顾虑，但经宣传员解释后，开荒一五○亩，为全区第一。南漳城关镇宣传员罗德全使瞒田户自动地报出隐瞒的田地。个别地区群众称宣传员为“顾问”。他们说：“有了宣传员，老百姓就能多知道好多事，过去好多事是糊里糊涂。”他们遇到不明白的事情，就说：“问问宣传员去，人家会知道的”。
     六、目前存在的问题
    （一）许多地区干部对建立宣传员的意义还认识不足，因此怕“把生产积极分子发展为宣传员后妨碍了生产”；或“没有人手搞”，他们还不知道建立宣传员正是为了增加人手。诸如此类的错误的认识急须纠正，否则宣传员的工作就无法展开的。
    （二）县区级宣传机构不健全，以致无人负责发展宣传员；或发展起来后无人领导，又垮了。
    （三）宣传员既建立以后，迫切需要提高他们的宣传能力和供给他们宣传资料。河南禹县一宣传员反映：“我们都愿干宣传员，就是贩不来货没啥卖，特别是缺乏时事宣传材料。”
    （作者注：本文未包括青年团系统宣传员在内。）
