To the Editor of Shanxi Workers' and Peasants' Living Standards Rise:
    The living standards of workers and peasants in Shanxi Province have significantly improved with the recovery and development of industrial and agricultural production and the smooth flow of materials between urban and rural areas.

    According to statistics from the Shanxi Provincial Department of Commerce, the total value of goods sold by various specialized companies in Shanxi Province from October to December 1950 increased fivefold compared to the same period in 1949. Many industrial products have directly flowed into rural areas. In the streets and shops of Taiyuan, one can often see groups of peasants carrying whole bolts of colorful foreign cloth on their shoulders and holding their favorite necessities, chatting happily.

    Peasants in the old liberated areas are very enthusiastic about developing production. In Lan County, in the past year, the peasants added a total of 4,363 head of livestock and purchased 23,260 pieces of farm tools, which is a great joy unseen in more than a decade. In the three months from October to December last year, farmers in the suburbs of Taiyuan City converted 150 iron-wheeled carts into rubber-tired carts.

    With the rise of material living standards, workers and peasants have a high enthusiasm for learning culture. According to incomplete statistics, more than 38,000 workers in the province regularly participate in cultural studies. According to statistics from nine counties in the Xingxian area, all 2,396 winter schools were opened in November last year for peasants' cultural studies. According to statistics from the Taiyuan branch of Xinhua Bookstore, the Changzhi branch alone sold more than 20,000 books of various kinds, worth over 120 million yuan, in November last year.

    The rise in the living standards and purchasing power of the working masses has opened up broad avenues for the development of industry and commerce. Since the adjustment of public-private relations, the business conditions of private industrial and commercial enterprises that are beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood have generally improved. Everyone reflects: "Business is easier to do now." In Changzhi Prefecture alone, 684 new industrial and commercial businesses were added in October last year. Many private industrialists and businessmen in the province are organizing joint ventures to go to the countryside to purchase agricultural and sideline products and promote sales to other places; and the industrial products exchanged are quickly sold out. Merchants in the Jincheng area said: "Now the goods are sold out before they even enter the storehouse."

　　山西工农生活上升编辑同志：
    山西省工人和农民的生活水平，随着工农业生产的恢复和发展以及城乡物资的畅流，有了显著的提高。
    据山西省商业厅的统计，山西省各专业公司在一九五○年十月到十二月份三个月中出售的货物总值，比一九四九年同一时期的出售货物总值增加了五倍。很多工业品已直接流入农村。太原市街头上和商店里，常常可以看到成群结队的农民，他们肩上扛着整匹的各色洋布，手里拿着他们所喜爱的必需品，喜气洋洋地交谈着。
    老区农民发展生产的劲头很大。岚县在去年一年里，全县农民一共增添了牲口四千三百六十三头，购买农具二万三千二百六十件，这是十多年来没有的大喜事。太原市郊区农民在去年十月到十二月份三个月中，把一百五十辆铁轮大车改换成了胶轮大车。
    随着物质生活的上升，工人、农民要求学习文化的情绪很高。据不完全统计，全省有三万八千多工人经常参加文化学习。农民的文化学习，据兴县专区九个县的统计，在去年十一月份已有两千三百九十六所冬学全部开学。据新华书店太原分店统计，全省十五个分支店，以长治支店的售书量来说，去年十一月份一个月内，就出售了各种书籍二万多本，价值一亿二千多万元。
    工农大众生活的上升和购买力的提高，给发展工商业开辟了广阔的道路。有益于国计民生的私营工商业，自调整公私关系以来，营业状况已普遍好转，大家都反映：“现在的买卖好做了。”长治专区仅在去年十月份就新增加了工商业户六百八十四家。全省不少的私营工商业家都在组织联营下乡收购农副业产品，向外埠推销；并且换回的工业品也很快就售完了，晋城一带的商人说：“现在是货不进栈就卖完了。”
