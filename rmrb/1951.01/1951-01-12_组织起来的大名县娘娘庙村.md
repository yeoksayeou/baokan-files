　　The Organized Niangniangmiao Village in Daming County
    The Communist Party of China Hebei Handan Regional Committee
    Niangniangmiao Village in Daming County is one of the typical villages in Hebei Province that has been organized. Eighty-three percent of the village's farmers participate in mutual aid teams, combining agriculture and sideline occupations. They have organized credit cooperatives and supply and marketing cooperatives, and have also established oil mills, manure yards, chicken warm houses, chicken farms, and bee farms. Agricultural production has been increasing year by year. In 1950, the village's total production averaged more than 40 catties per mu higher than before the war, and a maximum record of 1,176 catties of grain per mu was achieved by the farmer Jia Guanhe. Based on organization, the combination of agriculture and sideline occupations, and improved technology, the lives and production of the village farmers are rising step by step, like the rising sun.
    Niangniangmiao Village has a total of 607 households and 2,220 people. In 1945, the village's farmers began to implement organization on the basis of having already distributed land and property. However, the progress was intermittent. As of November 1948, except for some development in the three groups of Zhang Xishun, Jia Tizhong, and Ning Shanbao, other mutual aid groups generally stagnated in the low-level forms of shared plows, mutual assistance during busy periods, and disbanding during idle periods.
    The development of mutual aid teams in the village began in the spring of 1949. In the spring of 1949, there was a drought that made it impossible to sow seeds. At the same time, a large army was heading south, passing through the village and requiring hospitality. Under these circumstances, if the village did not implement organization, it would not be able to complete the tasks of drought resistance and planting, or of hosting the passing army. In order to do a good job of supporting the army and planting, the village first did a good job of propaganda and education, and the masses were sufficiently mobilized. The village cadres and Party members were extremely enthusiastic, so all 37 mutual aid teams in the village became active. Party member Hao Shumin, in conjunction with seven farmer households, organized two large carts to haul water for planting, completing the sowing of 36 mu of peanuts in eight days. The entire village completed the planting task in ten days. The masses personally experienced the benefits of mutual aid. At this time, the county and district leading cadres seized this favorable opportunity and focused on cultivating the Zhang Xishun group. They helped the group make plans, build a waterwheel well together, and replaced oxen and donkeys with mules and horses. The number of households participating in agricultural production increased from five to twenty-three (now twenty-four). In order to solve the fertilizer difficulties of the twenty-three households and absorb idle funds from the masses, the group also developed sideline production such as oil pressing and transportation, which yielded great profits. After seeing the benefits, the masses asked to join the group one after another, so a manure yard was opened, increasing the number of households participating in sideline production from twelve to one hundred and four. The entire group built two wells together and added two waterwheels. During spring plowing, they plowed three times and harrowed six times, applying four cartloads of manure per mu, and women went to the fields to work. The yield per mu that year increased by 30 catties compared to pre-war levels. In the winter of 1949, Zhang Xishun was elected as a county labor model, which further encouraged the village cadres and masses. In the minds of the cadres, masses, and Party members, participating in or leading mutual aid and working hard in production was considered glorious.
    At this time, the masses not only saw the benefits of mutual aid, but also had a direction for mutual aid – they organized to expand capital and increase production. Thus, the masses more consciously demanded further organization, which was a major development in the village's mutual aid. The Jia Jianming group, not wanting to be left behind, first took the Zhang Xishun group as an example, mobilized their own group and the Wen Keming and Shen Yongbin groups, and merged the three small groups into one large group of twenty-three households, and implemented a combination of agriculture and sideline occupations. When the wheat harvest was in full swing in 1950, this group used five teams of livestock, organizing both wheat harvesting and oil pressing simultaneously. They harvested, cut, and plowed the wheat as it ripened, and everything was done in a timely manner. In sideline occupations, they earned 300 catties of white oil and 2,000 catties of oil cake in one summer, and bought mules together. Under the influence of the Jia Jianming group, the Ning Baoshan group and the Wang Jinxiang group also merged into a large group of fourteen households. Wang Xien also linked fifteen households and organized a large group. The four large groups often competed with each other in production, striving to achieve increased agricultural production and a prosperous life.
    These four groups, being large and financially strong, invested part of their production income in credit, and mobilized other groups to invest and form a credit cooperative. On the one hand, it served the members, stipulating that members had priority of use and that putting money into the credit cooperative could also generate interest; on the other hand, it served the masses, supported production, and enlivened the village's economy. By the winter of 1949, the credit cooperative's capital had reached more than 4,600 catties of millet. In the spring of 1950, with the support of the credit cooperative, a large amount of idle funds from the masses was absorbed, the manure yard was expanded, and chicken warm houses, chicken farms, and bee farms were established. Twenty-four wells were drilled, sixteen waterwheels were installed, and 2,886 catties of grain were lent out to support production in disaster areas. On the basis of the credit cooperative, a supply and marketing cooperative was also established, transporting the oil from the eight oil mills led by the mutual aid teams to Tianjin and Jinan in exchange for foreign plows, rubber-tired carts, and fertilizer, and transporting some sideline products to Anyang, Handan, and Fengfeng in exchange for coal. In this way, the mutual aid teams, supply and marketing cooperatives, and credit cooperatives supported each other and developed together.
    The combination of agriculture and sideline occupations meant that agriculture supported the development of sideline occupations, and sideline occupations supported the improvement of agriculture. The masses in the village were willing to buy manure for their land. Zhang Liangchen and 30 other households bought fertilizer. Generally, 3 to 3.5 cartloads of fertilizer were applied per mu, and some households applied 4 cartloads of fertilizer per mu. In particular, after the crop comparison in 1950, the elderly middle peasant Zhao Jinxiang and his brothers dug out all 1,500 catties of beans that had been buried underground three years ago, and Zhang Kerang also dug out 700 catties of beans to make soybean oil and soybean cake for fertilizing the land for planting wheat. The village's yield increased year by year. Before the war, the average yield per mu was only 179 catties, and even well-managed rich peasants' average yield per mu did not exceed 190 catties. However, in 1950, the village's average yield reached 219 catties, exceeding the average yield of rich peasants' land before the Anti-Japanese War by 29 catties, and exceeding the general average yield by 40 catties. The result of mutual aid production was to improve the living standards of the farmers, while also changing the production conditions, and freeing up surplus labor for meticulous farming. Cultivation techniques were continuously improved. The masses in the village did not have the habit of irrigating the land in the past. Since Zhang Xishun's group began digging two wells and installing waterwheels for irrigation in 1949, and increasing production, the masses personally saw the benefits of irrigation. In 1950, 26 wells were dug through mutual aid, and 16 waterwheels were installed, and the village initially had the scale of paddy fields. Seed selection was also very common. Jia Guanhe selected the Huanong No. 4 grain seed, and with abundant fertilizer and water, harvested 1,176 catties per mu. Zhang Xishun selected the Si Zi cotton seed, and in the sandy land, with abundant fertilizer and water, and four to seven rounds of management, the yield of seed cotton reached 170 catties per mu. The entire village achieved meticulous farming and more fertilizer application. Individual groups used fertilizer, foreign plows, rubber-tired carts, and used sprayers to kill insects. In 1950, when capturing aphids and fire spiders, the village used 29 sprayers, and the pests were completely eliminated in five days, ensuring increased production of cotton and grain. In 1950, there was a bumper harvest of all grains, and the entire village rejoiced.
    According to recent statistics, the village already has 74 mutual aid teams, totaling 501 households, accounting for 83 percent of the village's total households. Among them, eleven groups implemented a combination of agriculture and sideline occupations and established eight oil mills. The proportion of new middle peasants participating in mutual aid accounted for 93 percent of the new middle peasant households, the proportion of old middle peasants participating in mutual aid accounted for 80 percent of the old middle peasant households, and the number of original landlords and rich peasants participating in mutual aid was only one household in 1949, but by 1950 it had reached 17 households, accounting for 30 percent of the total number of landlord and rich peasant households.

　　组织起来的大名县娘娘庙村
    中共河北邯郸地委会
    大名县娘娘庙村是河北省组织起来的典型的村庄之一。全村农民有百分之八十三参加了互助组，实行了农副业结合，组织了信贷社、供销社，还建立了油房、粪场、暖鸡房、养鸡厂和养蜂厂等。农业生产已逐年提高，一九五○年全村生产量平均每亩超过战前四十斤，而且出现了农民贾关和每亩收谷一千一百七十六斤的最高纪录。在组织起来，农副业结合和改良技术的基础上，全村农民的生活、生产，像初升的太阳一样，一步一步地上升着。
    娘娘庙全村共六百零七户，二千二百二十人。一九四五年，该村农民在已分得土地和财产的基础上，开始实行组织起来。但以后时起时落，截至一九四八年十一月，全村除张希顺、贾体中、宁善保三个组有些发展外，其他互助组一般地都停滞在伙合犋、忙时互助、闲时散伙的低级形式上。
    该村互助组的发展，是从一九四九年春天开始的。一九四九年春天，天旱无法播种，同时大军南下，路过该村，需要招待。在这种情况下，当时该村如果不实行组织起来，即不能完成抗旱点种和招待过路大军的任务。为了把拥军和点种都作好，该村首先作好了宣教工作，群众思想发动比较充分，村干部和党员情绪极高，因而全村三十七个互助组都活跃起来。党员郝书民，联合七户农民，组织两辆大车，拉水点种，八天完成了三十六亩花生的播种工作。全村十天完成了点种任务。群众亲身体验到互助的好处。这时，县、区领导干部，即抓住这一有利时机，有重点地培养了张希顺组。帮助该组作计划，伙打水车井，并把牛、驴换成骡、马。该组参加农业生产的由五户增到了二十三户（现在是二十四户）。为解决二十三户的肥料困难，和吸收群众的游资，该组又发展了打油、运输等副业生产，获利很大。群众看到了好处后，纷纷要求入组，因而又开了粪场，使参加副业生产的由十二户增到一○四户。全组伙打了两眼井，添了两辆水车。春耕时作到了耕三耙六，每亩上粪四车，妇女下地生产。当年生产量每亩即比战前增产三十斤。一九四九年冬，张希顺被选为县劳动模范，这又进一步鼓舞了全村干部和群众。在干部、群众和党员的思想里，都以为参加或领导互助努力生产是光荣的。
    这时，群众不但看到互助的好处，而且有了互助的方向——他们组织起来，扩大资金提高生产。这样，群众更自觉地要求进一步组织起来，这是该村互助的一大发展。贾建明组不愿后人，首先以张希顺组为实例，动员好了本组和文可明、申永彬两个小组，把三个小组合并为一个二十三户的大组，并实行了农副业结合。一九五○年麦收正忙的时候，这个组使着五犋牲口，一面组织麦收，一面打油，麦子熟一块、割一块、犁一块，一切都能及时作好。副业上一个夏天赚了三百斤白油、二千斤油饼，伙买了骡子。在贾建明组的影响下，宁保善组与王金香组也合并成了一个十四户的大组。王西恩也串连了十五户，组织了一个大组。四个大组经常比赛生产胜负，为实现农业增产和生活富裕而斗争。
    这四个组，组大财力壮，又将生产收入的一部分投入信贷，并动员其他小组投资组成了信贷社。一方面为社员服务，规定社员有使用优先权，同时把钱放到信贷社还能生息；另一方面给群众服务，支持生产，活跃全村经济。一九四九年冬天，信贷社的资金即达四千六百多斤小米。一九五○年春天，在信贷社的支持下，又大量吸收了群众的游资，扩大了粪场，建立了暖鸡房、养鸡厂和养蜂厂，并打井二十四眼，按水车十六辆，还贷出粮食二千八百八十六斤，支持灾区生产。在信贷社的基础上，又建立了供销社，把互助组领导的八个油房的油运往天津和济南，换回洋犁、胶轮车和肥田粉等，同时把某些副业产品运往安阳、邯郸和峰峰等地，换回煤炭。这样，互助组、供销社、信贷社就互相支持，共同发展起来了。
    农副业结合，农业支持了副业的发展，副业支持了农业提高。全村群众在农业生产方面，都肯买粪上地，张粮臣等三十户买了肥田粉，一般施肥每亩三车至三车半，个别户每亩施肥四车，特别是经过了一九五○年的比庄稼后，老中农赵金相兄弟俩把三年前埋藏在地下的豆子一千五百斤全刨出来，张克让也刨出豆子七百斤，打了豆油、豆饼上地种麦。全村产量逐年提高，战前一般每亩产量只合一七九斤，富农经营较好，每亩平均产量也不超过一九○斤，但是，一九五○年该村平均产量，却已达二百一十九斤，较抗日战争以前富农土地的平均产量超过二十九斤，超过一般平均产量四十斤。互助生产的结果，提高了农民的生活水平，同时也改变了生产条件，并有剩余劳力使用到精耕细作上，耕作技术不断改进。该村群众过去没有浇地习惯，自从一九四九年张希顺组开始打了两眼井，按上水车浇地，增加产量以后，群众亲眼看见浇地好处，一九五○年互助打井二十六眼，并按上十六辆水车，全村初步具备了水田规模。在选种方面也很普遍，贾关和选了华农四号谷种，粪大水勤每亩收到一千一百七十六斤。张希顺选的斯字棉种，在飞沙地里，粪大水勤，还整理了四遍到七遍，每亩籽棉产量达一百七十斤。全村都作到了精耕细作和多上粪，个别组使用了肥田粉、洋犁、胶皮轮车，并使用喷雾器杀虫，一九五○年捕蚜虫和火蜘蛛时，该村使用了二十九架喷雾器，五天时间把害虫全部消灭，保证了棉粮增产。一九五○年五谷丰登，全村欢腾。
    据最近统计，全村已有七十四个互助组，计五百零一户，占全村总户数的百分之八十三。其中十一个组实行了农副业结合，建立了八个油房。新中农参加互助的占新中农户数的百分之九十三，老中农参加互助的占老中农户数的百分之八十，原来的地主和富农参加互助的，一九四九年时，只有一户，一九五○年已有了十七户，占地主、富农总户数的百分之三十。
