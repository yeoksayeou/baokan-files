Jilin City Dongxiguan Christian Church
Holds Anti-American Aggression Meeting
Church Members Expressed Active Participation in the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement

[This News Report] Jilin City's Dongxiguan Christian Church held an anti-American imperialist aggression meeting on January 7th, attended by more than 120 people. At the meeting, male and female church members spoke enthusiastically, expressing extreme indignation at the imperialists' centuries-long use of the church to carry out conspiracies to anesthetize and enslave the Chinese people. Deacon Sun Hongci used the fact that the American imperialists helped the Manchu rulers suppress the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom revolutionary movement to expose the American imperialists' mask of carrying out their aggression under the guise of preaching. He said, "Hong Xiuquan accepted the doctrines of 'freedom, equality, peace, and love' and led the broad masses of peasants in an uprising to resist Manchu oppression and establish the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. However, this great revolutionary movement shook the imperialists' foundation of aggression in China, so they sent warships and organized foreign gun teams to act as accomplices of the rulers and suppress the peasant uprising. This clearly shows the true purpose of American imperialism preaching in China." Dr. Jin Qingyang of Gao Daifu Hospital said, "This time, the American imperialists invaded Korea and bombed and massacred the peaceful residents of Korea on a large scale; and the war criminal Truman is still praying to God in the White House, wishing the invading American army victory. Isn't this the true face of American imperialism using religion to carry out aggression?" The church members unanimously believed: "What we believe in is Christ, not imperialism. We must break with imperialism and implement the Three-Self Patriotic Movement of self-government, self-support, and self-propagation." Many church members expressed that they would take active action to participate in frontline transportation, stretcher-bearing, first aid, blood transfusion, and other work; and in the rear, prevent elements who are used by imperialism from infiltrating religion to carry out sabotage activities. After the meeting, a declaration was issued, calling on all church members to mobilize and participate in the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement.

　　吉林市东西关基督教会
    举行反美侵略大会         
    教徒表示积极参加抗美援朝运动
    【本报讯】吉林市东西关基督教会，于一月七日召开反对美帝侵略大会，到会一百二十余人。会上男女教徒热烈发言，对百余年来帝国主义利用教会，进行麻醉和奴化中国人民的阴谋极表愤慨。执事孙鸿慈，用美帝帮助满清统治者镇压太平天国革命运动的事实，揭穿美帝假传教之名进行其侵略阴谋的假面具。他说：“洪秀全接受了‘自由平等、和平博爱’的教义，领导着广大农民举行起义，反抗满清压迫，建立太平天国。但是这一伟大的革命运动，动摇了帝国主义在中国的侵略基础，他们就派遣军舰，组织洋枪队，作统治者的帮凶，镇压农民起义。这就清楚地看出美帝国主义在中国传教的真正目的。”高大夫医院金庆扬大夫说：“这次美帝侵朝，大肆轰炸、屠杀朝鲜的和平居民；而战争贩子杜鲁门还在白宫祈祷上帝，祝侵朝美军胜利。这不就是美帝国主义利用宗教进行侵略的真面目吗？”教徒们一致认为：“我们所信仰的是基督，不是帝国主义。我们要与帝国主义一刀两断，实行自治、自养、自传的三自运动。”许多教徒都纷纷表示：要积极行动起来，参加前线运输、担架、救护、输血等工作；在后方防止被帝国主义利用的分子钻进宗教来进行破坏活动。会后并发表宣言，号召全体教徒一致动员起来，参加抗美援朝运动。
