　　Thank you to the government for taking care of me
    ——Letter from Wang Chunqing, a military family member in Lishu County, Liaoxi

    To the Editor:
    I am Wang Chunqing, a revolutionary soldier's family member from Yangmulinzi Village, Twelfth District, Lishu County, Liaoxi Province. I am fifty-two years old this year. My son, Wang Shangxin, works in the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and now I am the only one at home. When my son joined the People's Liberation Army, I didn't quite believe in the government's policy of giving preferential treatment to revolutionary soldiers' families.
    On August 20th of last year, I became seriously ill. There was no one at home to take care of me, and I had no money for treatment, so I thought I had no hope.
    Comrade Mou from the village government learned that I was sick and immediately reported the situation to the district government. After Assistant Wang, a health worker from the district government, learned of this, he sent a doctor to treat me. The village government also mobilized villagers to take care of me, and someone cooked for me every day. Village cadres also often came to comfort me, just like family members. Moreover, when I was sick, the village plowed my land for me, completing three harrowings and three runs. I was both happy and grateful, and in less than half a month, I recovered.
    I didn't spend a penny or hire a single worker, but my illness was cured and my land was plowed. The government's care for military families is truly thoughtful; even if my son were at home, it couldn't be this perfect. In the future, I must respond to the government's call, actively participate in production. I will also write to my son, telling him to resolutely serve the people's liberation cause, defend the motherland, and liberate Taiwan and Tibet.
            Wang Chunqing, Military Family Member, Yangmulinzi Village, Lishu County, Liaoxi Province

### 感谢政府对我的照顾——辽西梨树县军属王纯清来信

　　感谢政府对我的照顾
    ——辽西梨树县军属王纯清来信编辑同志：
    我是辽西省梨树县十二区杨木林子村的革命军人家属，今年五十二岁。我儿子王尚新在中国人民解放军中工作，现在家里只有我一个人。在我儿子参加人民解放军的时候，我对政府优待革命军人家属的政策还不大相信。
    去年八月二十日，我得了一场重病。家里没人照顾我，我又没钱治病，我以为我一定没有希望了。
    村政府牟同志知道我有病，就立刻把这个情况反映到区政府。区政府王卫生助理员知道后，就派医生给我治疗。村政府还动员了村里人来照顾我，每天有人给我做饭。村干部又常来慰问我，和家人一样。并且，在我生病时，我的地由村里给我耕了，作到了三铲三趟。我又喜欢又感激，不到半月光景，病就好了。
    我没花一个钱，没雇一个工，病也好了，地也耕了。政府对军属的照顾真周到，就是我儿子在家，也不能这样圆满。我今后一定要响应政府号召，积极参加生产。还要给我儿子去信，叫他坚决为人民解放事业服务，保卫祖国，解放台湾和西藏。
            辽西省梨树县杨木林子村军属  王纯清
