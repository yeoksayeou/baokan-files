Xinhua News Agency, January 16th Dispatch from Budapest: Hungarian newspapers on the 13th published a statement by the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding the attack and serious injury of Mrs. Gyulai Ida, Counselor of the Hungarian Embassy in the United States. According to information released by the United States, the perpetrator was Henry Gardinar, of Hungarian descent. On the 10th, he traveled from New York to Washington, D.C., and arranged for a reporter and a photographer from the American International News Service to break into the Hungarian Embassy. Mrs. Gyulai Ida, the embassy counselor, received them. The perpetrator, in front of the reporters, attacked Mrs. Gyulai Ida with a sharp blade, causing her severe injuries in four places. Afterwards, the American police only arrested Henry Gardinar, without questioning the two reporters present, nor investigating the relationship between the International News Service and the case. The news service only claimed that it sent personnel to cover the event after receiving a phone call.

　　The Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a note of protest to the U.S. Embassy in Hungary on the 11th. At the same time, the Hungarian Ambassador to the U.S., Horvath, also submitted the same note to the U.S. State Department. The note pointed out: (1) The presence of reporters during the attack proves that this was a premeditated act of provocation. (2) The crime is a direct consequence and continuation of the increasingly rampant slander campaign against the Hungarian People's Republic, carried out within the United States with the knowledge and approval of official leaders. (3) The execution of the crime and the failure to detain the two reporters show that the relevant U.S. authorities have not provided the Hungarian Embassy and diplomatic personnel with the necessary protection. The note stated: The Hungarian government expresses its great indignation at this incident and demands that the U.S. government thoroughly investigate the crime and severely punish the perpetrator and his accomplices. The United States should issue corresponding instructions to ensure the safety of the Hungarian Embassy and diplomatic personnel in the United States.

　　匈驻美使馆参赞被刺重伤
    匈向美抗议要求惩凶     
    指出凶案是美国预谋的挑衅罪行
    【新华社十六日讯】据塔斯社布达佩斯讯：匈牙利各报十三日刊载了匈牙利外交部发表的关于匈牙利驻美大使馆参赞久拉依·伊达夫人遇刺重伤的经过情形称：据美国传布的消息说，凶犯是祖籍匈牙利的亨利·加得纳尔，他于十日由纽约到华盛顿，约了美国国际新闻社的一个记者和一个摄影记者闯入匈牙利大使馆。大使馆参赞久拉伊·伊达夫人接见了他们。凶犯竟当着记者的面以利刃刺杀久拉依·伊达夫人，致重伤四处。事后美国警察仅逮捕了亨利·加得纳尔，而未过问在场的两个记者，亦未调查国际新闻社与此案的关系。该新闻社仅称系接到电话后派员前往采访的。
    匈牙利外交部已于十一日向美国驻匈大使馆致送抗议照会。同时，匈牙利驻美大使霍瓦斯亦将同一照会送交美国国务院。照会指出：（一）凶案进行时有记者在场，证明这是预谋的挑衅罪行。（二）凶案显系美国国内由官方领袖与闻并认可进行的日益嚣张的对匈牙利人民共和国诽谤中伤运动的直接后果与继续。（三）凶案的得以进行及两个记者的未被拘留，说明美国有关当局对匈牙利使馆及外交人员并未予以应有的保护。照会声称：匈牙利政府对此事表示极大愤慨，要求美国政府彻查凶案，严惩凶手及其同谋犯。对于匈牙利驻美使馆及外交人员的安全，美国应颁布相应的指令予以保障。
