Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 13th: The Preparatory Committee of the Tianjin Catholic Reform Movement Promotion Association issued a declaration on the 13th, warmly responding to the self-reliance and reform movement initiated by Catholics in Guangyuan, Chongqing, and other places. This declaration was adopted at a symposium held on the 11th by Tianjin Catholics Wu Kezhai, Zhang Yushi, Fan Enkun, and others. At the meeting, attendees unanimously agreed that every Catholic should stand firm on the position of the Chinese people, support and abide by the Common Program and all policies and decrees of the People's Government, and, in the spirit of patriotism, completely sever ties with imperialism and promote the self-reliance and reform movement. Currently, they should also enthusiastically participate in the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend our country, and safeguard world peace. In addition to unanimously resolving to issue a declaration, all attendees elected and established the Preparatory Committee of the Tianjin Catholic Reform Movement Promotion Association to uniformly lead the self-reliance and reform movement of Catholicism in the city. Catholics in various church units in the city warmly support this reform movement, and as many as one hundred people signed the declaration on the 12th alone. The full text of the declaration is as follows:
    Catholic brothers and sisters across the country:
    For the past hundred years, the disaster-ridden Chinese nation has been at the mercy of imperialist powers, and Catholicism has also been used by imperialism as a tool of aggression. Historically, how many times have imperialist wars of aggression against China been launched under the pretext of religious cases? A series of unequal treaties explicitly stipulated "special privileges for missionaries in China," with the aim of using the church as their tool of aggression. Imperialists used the special privilege of freedom of missionary work in China, causing churches scattered throughout the country to resemble concessions. Imperialists used their hypocritical benevolent faces to conceal their actual aggression, distort the truth of God, and deceive and numb the Chinese people; at the same time, they used charities such as churches, hospitals, and schools as shields to buy off and win over backward elements for espionage activities. The espionage cases in Xianxian, Shenyang, Qiqihar, Jiaozuo, and Shijiazhuang are all undeniable facts.
    Now that the entire Chinese people have stood up, we have also clearly recognized that the church, which has been used by imperialism, not only hinders China from moving towards independence, freedom, democracy, peace, unity, prosperity, and strength, but also in fact gives the greatest shame to God. They are precisely the Pharisees that our Lord Jesus condemned. We, the devout Catholics who are zealous in revering God, are the brave soldiers of Jesus, and we must restore the spirit of our Lord Jesus against the Pharisees. We have the courage and the duty to resolutely wash away the shame that the Pharisees have brought to God, stand firm on the position of the Chinese people, support the Common Program, oppose imperialism, completely sever all ties with imperialism, and implement the policy of Chinese Catholic autonomy, self-support, and self-propagation. We now establish the Tianjin Catholic Reform Movement Promotion Association, willing to unite with Catholics, priests, and bishops in Tianjin and across the country to jointly strive for the bright future of Catholic self-reliance and reform.
    Catholic brothers and sisters in Tianjin and other places, we are patriotic Catholics, and we cannot tolerate imperialists using Catholicism to carry out their conspiracy to invade our country. We must enthusiastically participate in the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend our country. We must recognize that this is the will of God, expose those who have historically served imperialism, and thoroughly eliminate the influence of imperialism. We warmly support and respond to the call of priests and Catholics in Guangyuan, Chongqing, Suiyuan, Nanchang, Wuhan, Jiajiang, Yuechi, and other places in northern Sichuan, and strive for self-reliance and reform in the short term.

　　天津天主教革新运动促进会筹备会
    自立革新宣言
    【新华社天津十三日电】天津市天主教革新运动促进会筹备会于十三日发表宣言，热烈响应广元、重庆等地教友发起的自立革新运动。这个宣言系在该市天主教徒吴克斋、张羽时、范恩锟等于十一日举行的座谈会上通过的。会上，出席者一致认为：每一个天主教徒都应当站稳中国人民的立场，拥护和遵守共同纲领及人民政府的一切政策法令，并应本爱国的精神，彻底割断与帝国主义之间的联系，促进自立革新运动；在目前，并要热烈地参加抗美援朝保家卫国运动，保卫世界和平。全体与会者除一致决议发表宣言外，并推选和成立了天津市天主教革新运动促进会筹备会，统一领导该市天主教的自立革新运动。该市各教会单位的天主教徒热烈拥护这一革新运动，仅十二日一天内，在宣言上签名的即达一百人。该宣言全文如下：全国各地天主教教友们：
    灾难深重的中华民族，近百年来为各帝国主义侵略的俎上肉，而天主教亦被帝国主义利用为侵略工具。历史上有多少次帝国主义侵华战争是以教案为借口而发动的。一连串的不平等条约里，都明文载定“在华传教特权”，目的就是借教会作为他们侵略工具。帝国主义者借用在华传教自由特权，致使散布在全国的教堂形同租界。帝国主义者以其虚伪的仁慈面目，掩饰其侵略实际，歪曲了天主的真理，来愚弄与麻醉中国人民；同时利用教会、医院、学校等慈善事业为护符，以小恩、小惠收买与拢络落后分子，进行间谍活动。如献县、沈阳、齐齐哈尔、焦作、石家庄间谍案，都是无可置辩的事实。
    现在全中国人民已经站起来了，我们也明确认识了受帝国主义所利用的教会，不但阻碍了我们中国走向独立、自由、民主、和平、统一、富强的道路，而且事实上是给了天主最大的耻辱。他们正是吾主耶稣所指责的法利赛人，我们热心恭敬天主的教友们，我们是耶稣的勇兵，要恢复吾主耶稣反对法利赛人的精神。我们有勇气、也有本份坚决洗掉法利赛人给予天主的耻辱，站稳中国人民的立场拥护共同纲领，反对帝国主义，彻底割断与帝国主义各方面的联系，实行中国天主教自治、自养、自传的方针，我们今特成立天津市天主教革新运动促进会，愿和天津及全国教友、神父、主教们团结一致，共同为天主教自立革新的光明前途而奋斗。
    天津及各地教友们，我们是热爱祖国的天主教徒，我们不能容忍帝国主义者利用天主教来进行侵略我国的阴谋活动，我们要热烈地参加抗美援朝保家卫国运动，我们要认清那是天主的道理，揭露历来为帝国主义服务的分子，彻底肃清帝国主义的影响，我们热烈地拥护与响应川北广元、重庆、绥远、南昌、武汉、夹江、岳池等地神长及教友们的号召，力求短期内自立革新。
