　　Xinhua News Agency, 4th: Farmers in various parts of North China are utilizing the winter slack season to carry out winter repairs on farmland irrigation and water conservancy.

　　Shanxi Province is carrying out winter maintenance on 209 medium-sized rivers and canals and more than 600 small canals. The Fen River He Kou project has now completed nearly 80,000 cubic meters of earthwork, which is estimated to increase irrigation for 250,000 mu of land. In Chahar Province, the Changsheng Canal and other canals of all sizes have now been completely repaired and all are releasing water. The Sanggan River siltation irrigation area and Yumin Canal in the province can irrigate 120,000 mu of land. The irrigated area of each canal in Lingqiu, Xuanhua and other places also increased by nearly two times compared with the previous year. In Hebei Province, the exploration and material preparation work of Fang Lai Zhuo Canal, Yongsheng Canal, Ling Zheng Canal (Fang Lai Zhuo Canal is a large canal connecting Fangshan, Laishui and Zhuoxian counties, Ling Zheng Canal is a large canal connecting Lingshou and Zhengding counties), Rongzhen Canal and other canals and the huge dike works of Huang Yang Gate in Houtao, Suiyuan Province have also been carried out separately. The survey work of the Democratic Canal and Tianlai Canal in Xinxiang County, Pingyuan Province, and Yongli Canal in Anyang has been completed.

　　At the same time, various places have also made appropriate adjustments to the irrigation management of various canals. For example, in some areas of Shanxi Province, a water conservancy representative meeting was held at the beginning of winter irrigation to rectify the local water conservancy organizations. The water conservancy committees of districts and villages in Yanggao, Shangyi and other counties in Chahar Province held meetings with landowners to discuss and determine the method of calculating work based on earthwork and apportioning wages based on land area, which made the enthusiasm of the masses for canal construction even higher. In Huai'an and other counties in the province during winter irrigation, canals and households agreed on a method of jointly using water to effectively prevent the phenomena of grabbing water and wasting water in the past.

　　恢复战前农业生产水平加紧水利冬修工程
    华北进行农田水利冬修工作
    【新华社四日讯】华北各地农民利用冬闲期间进行农田水利的冬修工作。
    山西省冬季进行的岁修工程有中型河渠二百零九道及小型渠道六百多道。汾河合口工程现已完成近八万土方，计可增浇田地二十五万亩。察哈尔省长盛渠等大小渠道现已整修完毕，全部放水。该省桑干河淤灌区与裕民渠能浇地十二万亩。灵邱、宣化等地各渠去年浇地面积也比前年增加近两倍。河北省房涞涿渠、永盛渠、灵正渠（房涞涿渠为贯通房山、涞水、涿县三县的大渠，灵正渠为贯通灵寿、正定两县的大渠）、荣臻渠等渠道与绥远省后套黄杨闸等巨大堤工的勘察和备料工作也已分别进行。平原省新乡县的民主渠、天赉渠以及安阳的永利渠勘测工作业已完成。
    同时，各地对各渠灌溉管理也进行了适当的调整。如山西省个别地区在冬浇开始时，曾召开水利代表会议，整顿了当地的水利组织。察哈尔省阳高、尚义等县各区、村的水利委员会，曾召开地户会议，商定了按土方计工，按田亩分摊工资的修渠办法，使群众的修渠情绪更加高涨。该省怀安等县在冬浇中，渠与渠、户与户之间曾协定共同使水的办法，以有效地杜绝以往抢水和浪费水的现象。
