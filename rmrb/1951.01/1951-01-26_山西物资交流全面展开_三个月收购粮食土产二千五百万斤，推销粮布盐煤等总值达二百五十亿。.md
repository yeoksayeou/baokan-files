　　Shanxi Fully Launches Materials Exchange
　　Three Months of Procuring 25 Million Jin of Grain and Local Products, Promoting 25 Billion Worth of Grain, Cloth, Salt, Coal, etc.

　　[This newspaper reports] The winter materials exchange work in Shanxi Province is now being fully launched. In the material exchange, state-owned trading companies, cooperatives, and private merchants in various regions have universally paid attention to the promotion and purchase of agricultural and sideline products; at the same time, they have promptly supplied the industrial products needed by the rural areas. According to statistics from the province's state-owned specialized companies alone: from October to the end of December last year, a total of 1.08 million jin of wheat, 6.96 million jin of autumn grain, 8.93 million jin of ginned cotton, 1.19 million jin of hemp skin, and 7.76 million jin of other items such as peach and apricot kernels, medicinal materials, peppercorns, oilseeds, and sheepskins were purchased. In terms of supplying industrial products to the rural areas, a total of 7.54 million jin of flour, over 200,000 bolts of various colored cloth, over 69,000 bundles of cotton yarn, over 100,000 dan of edible salt, 100,000 tons of coal, and other general merchandise such as matches and paints, totaling 25 billion yuan, have been sold in the past three months. This has led to a thriving material exchange between urban and rural areas, and between regions.

　　The reason why the province's urban-rural material exchange work has achieved such results is that leadership organs at all levels attach great importance to this work. In August last year, the Provincial Government's Department of Commerce convened a meeting of industrial and commercial section chiefs and managers of specialized companies from various special districts (administrative offices), counties, and cities to specifically study the purchase of local products, promotion methods, and the importance and role of relying on cooperatives to unite private merchants for material exchange. Subsequently, special districts and counties convened financial and economic meetings, inviting private merchants to participate, and implemented the policy of benefiting both public and private sectors, thus making the urban and rural economy appear very active after entering winter. The purchase volume of state-owned trading companies alone in October and November last year increased by two times compared to the same period in 1949.

　　Secondly, cooperatives at all levels and specialized companies have signed contracts, adopting a chain business model of credit purchases, orders, and exchanges to purchase local products and sell industrial products. Many supply and marketing cooperatives in the Yuncheng and Fenyang special districts go to the countryside to purchase cotton and local products from farmers on credit at list prices, stipulating that they will follow price increases but not decreases, and issuing credit receipts to farmers. Farmers can use the receipts to purchase general merchandise, cloth, and grain from state-owned department stores, cotton yarn and cloth, grain and other specialized companies; the remaining balance will be subject to interest after the stipulated period expires. This method has been embraced by the broad masses of farmers. By the end of last year, Wenshui and Jiaocheng had purchased nearly 800,000 jin of cotton from farmers on credit. Xinjiang, Ronghe, Hejin and other counties also ordered 1 million jin. Cooperatives not only promoted the sale of a large amount of mountain and local products for their members, but also used mountain products to offset a huge amount of public grain for their members; the Changzhi and Yuci special district cooperatives alone offset 1.5 million jin for their members. This business not only saved farmers a lot of trouble, but more importantly, it saved a lot of cash and ensured price stability.

　　Finally, the policy of benefiting both public and private sectors was implemented, uniting private merchants; regional price differences were adjusted; coupled with the nationwide liberation and convenient transportation, the enthusiasm of private merchants to operate was boosted, and they actively raised funds for joint sales and purchases, going deep into the countryside for purchases. Ironware in the Yangquan, Changzhi, and Jincheng areas has historically had poor sales, but since winter, demand has exceeded supply, and the masses have reported that goods are sold out before they even enter the store. Merchants from Lanzhou, Xi'an, Shangqiu, Luohe, Zhengzhou, Xuchang and other places came to the producing areas to purchase and sell goods, which has not happened in more than a decade; in order to make production and sales more planned, many merchants have signed order contracts with iron furnace industries, opening up broad prospects for the restoration and development of the iron furnace industry. Pinglu's gypsum production is 9 million jin per year, and sales have been difficult for many years. Last year, private merchants from Shanghai, Qingdao, and other places alone purchased and sold more than 7 million jin. Private Chinese medicine and mountain goods industries in Taiyuan City raised 40 million yuan to go to the countryside for purchases, and carried more than 1 million jin of grain to supply farmers. Changzhi sold more than 1.6 million jin of hemp skin, with private merchants accounting for 70% of the total sales. Many private merchants carried samples of local products to Suiyuan, Tianjin, and other places to open up old sales channels and exchange them for industrial products. Taiyuan City's private trust merchant firm has signed mutual sales and purchase business contracts with trust companies in Tianjin, Shenyang, Jinan, Shijiazhuang and other cities; the goods exchange contract with Shijiazhuang City has already started in January, with Taiyuan exchanging 300,000 jin of oil cakes and 1 million jin of miscellaneous grains per month for Shijiazhuang's mountain deer cloth and other industrial products to supply rural needs.

　　山西物资交流全面展开
    三个月收购粮食土产二千五百万斤，推销粮布盐煤等总值达二百五十亿。
    【本报讯】山西省冬季物资交流工作，现正在全面展开。在物资交流中，各地国营贸易公司、合作社和私商都普遍注意了农副业产品的推销和收购；同时又及时地供给了农村需要的工业品。仅据该省国营专业公司统计：去年十月至十二月底共收购小麦一百零八万斤，秋粮六百九十六万斤，皮棉八百九十三万斤，麻皮一百一十九万斤，其他如桃杏仁、药材、花椒、油料及羊皮等共七百七十六万余斤。在供给农村工业品方面，三个月来共推销面粉七百五十四万斤，各色布二十余万匹，棉纱六万九千余捆，食盐十万余担，煤十万余吨，其他火柴、颜料等百货总值达二百五十亿元。使城市与农村，地区与地区间的物资交流达到畅旺。
    该省城乡物资交流工作所以获得这样成绩，是由于各级领导机关对这一工作都极为重视。去年八月间省府商业厅曾召开各专（署）、县、市工商科长和各专业公司经理会议，专门研究土产收购，推销做法，及依靠合作社团结私商对于物资交流的重要性和作用。接着各专、县都召开了财经会议，邀请了私商参加，贯彻了公私兼顾政策，因而使得城乡经济进入冬季后显得十分活跃。仅国营贸易公司去年十、十一两月收购量就比一九四九年同时期增加两倍。
    其次，各级合作社和各专业公司订立合同，采用赊购、订购、换购的连环业务，收购土产，出售工业品。运城和汾阳两专区不少县供销社到乡下按牌价向农民赊购棉花、土产，规定听涨不听落，给农民开赊货凭据，农民持证到国营百货、花纱布、粮食等专业公司购买百货布匹粮食；余额部分在规定的期满以后，另加利息。这种办法受到广大农民的拥护。文水、交城至去年年底共赊购农民棉花近八十万斤。新绛、荣河、河津等县也订购了一百万斤。合作社不但推销了社员大量的山货土产，而且以山货代社员抵交了巨大数量的公粮；仅长治、榆次两个专区社就代社员抵交了一百五十万斤。这种业务，不仅使农民节省了很多事，更重要的是节省了大量的现金，保证了物价稳定。
    最后，贯彻了公私兼顾政策，团结了私商；调整了地区差价；加以全国解放，交通运输便利，鼓舞了私商的经营积极性，纷纷集资联销、联购，深入农村收购。阳泉、长治、晋城一带的铁货历年来销路不好，入冬后则供不应求，群众反映货不进栈就卖完了。兰州、西安、商邱、漯河、郑州、许昌等地客商到产地购销者为十余年来所未有；为使产销更有计划，很多客商已和铁炉业签订了定货合同，给铁炉业的恢复和发展开辟了广阔的前途。平陆的石膏年产九百万斤，历年来销售困难，去年仅上海、青岛等地的私商就购销七百多万斤。太原市私商国药业、山货业集资四千万元下乡收购，并携带粮食百余万斤供给农民。长治销出麻皮一百六十多万斤，私商占推销总数百分之七十。很多私商携带土产货样，亲赴绥远、天津等地开辟旧有销路、换回工业品。太原市私营信托商行曾和天津、沈阳、济南、石家庄等城市的信托公司订立了互销互购的业务合同；与石家庄市的货物互换合同已在一月份开始，太原每月以油饼三十万斤、杂粮一百万斤，换取石市的山鹿布和其它工业品，以供应农村需要。
