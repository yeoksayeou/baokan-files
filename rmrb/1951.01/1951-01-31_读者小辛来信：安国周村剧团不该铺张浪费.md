	Anguo Zhoucun Theater Troupe Should Not Be Extravagant and Wasteful
	Zhoucun village cadres in Anguo County, Hebei Province, disregarded the difficulties in the lives of the masses and were extravagant and wasteful in the Spring Festival cultural activities. Zhoucun suffered a flood last year, with little harvest and difficult living conditions for the masses. The village cadres and heads of the village theater troupe did not pay attention to thrift but used more than 3,000 jin of wheat, which the village had left over from land reform for running cooperatives, to buy theatrical costumes in Tianjin and planned to buy things in Beijing. Moreover, the plays performed by the village theater troupe were mostly programs with feudal toxins, such as "Qin Xuemei Mourns" and "Qiu Hu Teases His Wife." I hope the Anguo County government will help the Zhoucun Theater Troupe correct this extravagance and waste and stop performing feudal superstitious programs.

Editor's Note: In the Spring Festival cultural activities in some villages in Zhuozhou and Anguo Counties, Hebei Province, there were phenomena of forcing the masses to contribute grain and money, as well as various forms of extravagance and waste, especially in Zhoucun, Anguo County, which suffered from floods and the masses had difficult lives. Instead of making full use of existing resources to organize the masses to produce and overcome the famine, the village cadres took 3,000 jin of wheat to buy "costumes" and perform feudal superstitious programs that poisoned the masses. This is obviously a serious violation of the interests of the masses. This phenomenon should be corrected in a timely manner and attract attention from all localities. The cultural and educational departments of governments at all levels should guide the Spring Festival cultural activities of the masses in the correct direction, conduct patriotic and internationalist education through various art forms familiar and loved by the masses, cooperate with the political and cultural learning of the masses, promote current events, improve production, and pay attention to preventing extravagance and waste. In this regard, the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government issued the "Instructions on Carrying out Spring Festival Mass Propaganda Work and Literary and Artistic Work" on January 14, which has been explained in detail, and all localities should study and implement it.

　  安国周村剧团不该铺张浪费
    河北省安国县周村村干部不顾群众生活的困难，在春节文艺活动中，铺张浪费。周村去年曾遭水灾，收成无几，群众生活困难。村干部和村剧团负责人不注意节约，却把村里在土地改革时留下办合作社用的胜利果实小麦三千多斤，到天津买了唱戏用的“行头”，并准备到北京买东西。而村剧团所演的戏多是带有封建毒素的《秦雪梅吊孝》、《秋胡戏妻》等类节目。我希望安国县政府帮助周村剧团改正这种铺张浪费现象，并停止上演封建迷信的节目。
          刘德明、辛玉振
    编者按：河北省涿县、安国县某些村庄在春节文艺活动中，强迫向群众摊粮、派款及各种铺张浪费现象，尤其像安国县周村，因遭受水灾，群众生活困难。村干部不充分利用现有资财，组织群众生产度荒；却拿三千斤小麦去置买“行头”，演唱毒害群众的封建迷信节目。这显然是严重违反群众利益的行为。此种现象，应及时纠正和引起各地注意。各级人民政府文教部门应把群众的春节文艺活动引导向正确的方向，通过群众所熟悉和喜爱的各种艺术形式，进行爱国主义与国际主义教育，与群众的政治文化学习相配合，宣传时事，提高生产，并注意防止铺张浪费。对此，中央人民政府文化部和教育部于一月十四日发出的《关于开展春节群众宣传工作与文艺工作的指示》中，已详尽说明，各地应研究执行。
