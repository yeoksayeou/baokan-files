The Beijing Municipal People's Government and the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, recognizing that the food for students in Beijing schools was generally poor and often lacked vegetables, issued a call to all schools in the spring of last year to carry out after-school production, and allocated 2,032 mu of land in the suburbs, with low-interest loans from the Municipal People's Bank totaling the equivalent of 495,414 catties of millet. Under the principle of voluntarism, a total of 81 colleges and middle schools participated in production, with 38,450 students, accounting for 80% of the total number of students in the city. According to incomplete statistics from 78 schools, the total annual harvest of vegetables was more than 2,326,600 catties, and the grain harvest was more than 2,687,900 catties, which initially improved the students' food.

　　Teachers and Students of Ginling Women's Arts and Science College Denounce American Imperialism

　　According to the Nanjing Xinhua Daily on January 13th: Teachers and students of Ginling Women's Arts and Science College, who have been culturally poisoned by American imperialism for 36 years, jointly exposed that the American imperialists founded Ginling Women's Arts and Science College to deepen the cultural poisoning of Chinese women. The most significant thing is to ignore the study of Chinese language and Chinese history, attempting to make students forget the history and culture of their motherland. At the same time, American professors shamelessly assigned absurd "reference books" to teach female students to seduce men. Teachers and students of Huiwen Girls' Middle School also vehemently denounced the cultural poisoning of American imperialism.

　　Tianjin Colleges and Universities Launch Review Movement

　　According to the Progress Daily on January 15th: The movement of colleges and universities in Tianjin to apply for military cadre schools has come to a successful conclusion.

Now, schools are enthusiastically launching a patriotic review movement. In the review movement, teachers enthusiastically help students review and make up lessons; students can abide by the learning system, and generally adhere to current affairs learning.
