　　Handan Publicly Operated Fuchang Flour Company
    Should Not Arbitrarily Extend Working Hours
To the Editor:
    Recently, the Handan Town Publicly Operated Fuchang Flour Company in Hebei has increased the daily working hours from the past eight-hour system, as instructed by the Provincial Department of Industry, to ten hours due to the installation of machinery. In the past, the company paid overtime wages for extra hours during major machine repairs, but this time, the manager refused to pay extra wages for the two hours of overtime each day for machinery installation. The manager said: "According to the Labor Decision, working hours are eight to ten hours. We haven't exceeded the stipulated time, so there's no need to pay overtime." The workers' opinions are: (1) It used to be an eight-hour system, so now it's considered two hours of overtime each day; (2) According to the Labor Decision, extending working hours in special circumstances must be approved by the local government; (3) According to the Labor Decision, continuous overtime should not exceed four days, but it has been continuous for three months; (4) The overtime was not discussed with all workers. Therefore, the workers believe that overtime should be paid. Because this overtime wage issue has not been reasonably resolved, the workers' production morale is low. We hope that relevant departments can pay attention to this.

    Editor's Note: The Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference stipulates that workers' working hours are eight to ten hours. However, since the company originally had an eight-hour system, if it needs to increase working hours due to production needs, it should obtain the consent of the labor union and the approval of the labor bureau before it can be extended. The company did not go through this procedure, nor did it explain it to the workers, so it is wrong to revise the working hours on its own. Wages should be paid for the extended hours.

### 邯郸公营复昌面粉公司  不应擅自延长工时

　　邯郸公营复昌面粉公司
    不应擅自延长工时编辑同志：
    河北邯郸镇公营复昌面粉公司，最近由于安装机器，每天工作时间由过去省工业厅指示的八小时制增加至十小时。该公司过去大修机器加点时都按时增加工资，但这次安装机器每日加点两小时，经理却不肯加发工资。说是：“按劳大决议，工作时间是八小时至十小时。咱们还没超过规定时间，用不着加工资。”工人的意见是：（一）过去是八小时制，现在算是每天加点两小时；（二）根据劳大决议，特殊情况要延长时间，必须经过当地政府批准；（三）根据劳大决议，加工连续不得超过四天，现已连续加工三个月了；（四）加点时未经全体工人讨论。因此工人认为加点就应加工资。该厂因为这一加工资问题未得到合理解决，工人生产情绪低落。希望有关部门能予以注意。

    编者按：人民政协共同纲领中规定工人工作时间为八小时至十小时。但该公司原是八小时制，如因生产需要增加工作时间，应取得工会的同意，经劳动局批准后，方可延长。该公司既未经过此项手续，亦未向工人说明，迳自改订工时是不对的。其所延长时数，应加发工资。
