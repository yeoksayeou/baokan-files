Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 2nd (TASS): President Pieck of the German Democratic Republic delivered a New Year's Eve radio address to the German people.

Pieck pointed out that the working people of the German Democratic Republic had achieved great success in the past year. The two-year plan for revitalizing the national economy was basically completed in one year and eight months.

Pieck stated: Thanks to the concerted action of all anti-fascist democratic parties and people's organizations participating in the United Front, it has now been proven that we can indeed jointly build and consolidate our young democratic country. The parliamentary elections held on October 15th by the People's Chamber and the states, districts, and residential areas, have achieved an unprecedented victory in German history in the united struggle for peace, revival, and happiness.

Pieck pointed out: After moderately increasing rations at the end of 1949, Democratic Germany proved in 1950 that it was able to fully increase rations, and by the end of this year, the rationing system for bread and grain products had been abolished. Measures to increase wages, pensions, sickness benefits, cancel debts owed by turned-over farmers and returning overseas Chinese, subsidize newly returned overseas Chinese, and further reduce shop prices have greatly improved the living standards of people of all strata throughout the country. From January 1, 1951, the first year of the Five-Year Plan will begin to be implemented, stipulating further development of major industries, including coal mining, steel, chemical, and heavy machinery manufacturing. He said: The increase in industrial and agricultural products and the development of domestic and foreign trade will enable us to further move towards the final elimination of economic difficulties and improve the supply of consumer goods in 1951.

Pieck continued: The imperialist camp is spreading war hysteria in an attempt to undermine these plans for joyful labor and future success. American imperialists are fighting 5,000 miles outside their own borders against the Korean people who are defending their country's independence and unity. After suffering a serious defeat there, American imperialism is frantically accelerating the re-militarization of West Germany. According to the so-called Brussels military conference of the Atlantic Treaty Organization, West Germany will be turned into a military springboard and battlefield for aggression. However, the German people are determined to complete the unification of a peace-loving and democratic Germany, conclude a just peace treaty with Germany, and demand the withdrawal of all occupying forces. The Prague Conference of the Eight Foreign Ministers has pointed out the path towards this great goal.

Pieck declared: Premier Grotewohl's letter to Federal Chancellor Adenauer is the first step by the Republic's government to negotiate the establishment of an all-German constitutional assembly and the assembly's tasks in a spirit of sincerity and mutual understanding. Taking this step is entirely in line with the policy we have pursued since the establishment of the German Democratic Republic. Pieck said: The United States' frantic arms build-up in West Germany fully demonstrates that our political direction is correct. We will continue to implement this policy in the new year, and I believe that the vast majority of the German people in the East and West will agree with this policy. Pieck particularly pointed out that Marshal Stalin declared at the time of the establishment of the German Democratic Republic: "There is no doubt that the side-by-side existence of a peace-loving democratic Germany and a peace-loving Soviet Union makes the possibility of a new war in Europe impossible, ends the bloodshed in Europe, and makes it impossible for world imperialists to enslave Europe." After detailing the various assistance provided by the Soviet government to the German people in 1950, Pieck pointed out: This friendship is also reflected in the Soviet Union's initiative to convene the Prague Conference of the Eight Foreign Ministers. The decisions of this conference will help the German people complete their task of restoring national unity and independence.

Pieck concluded: Next year, the greatest goal of all our activities, all our efforts, and policies must be: to do our utmost to carry out the struggle to defend peace; to widely establish peace committees throughout the country, which must be led by the best representatives of our people; and to make the people of the whole country participate in the struggle for peace. Our task is to build a unified, peace-loving, democratic Germany, a Germany that will maintain friendly and good-neighborly relations with peace-loving people all over the world.

　　德皮克总统广播演说
    德国人民决心完成民主统一   
    并努力开展保卫和平的斗争
    【新华社四日讯】塔斯社柏林二日讯：德意志民主共和国总统皮克于除夕广播告德国人民书。
    皮克指出德意志民主共和国的劳动人民在过去一年中已获得了巨大的成就。复兴国民经济的两年计划在一年零八个月中便基本上完成了。
    皮克称：由于参加统一阵线的所有反法西斯民主党派和人民团体的一致行动，现在已经证明了我们的确能够共同建设和巩固我们这个年青的民主国家。十月十五日人民议会及各州、区和居民区所举行的议会选举，已获得了德国历史上在为争取和平、复兴和幸福而进行的团结一致的斗争中空前的胜利。
    皮克指出：民主德国在一九四九年底适度地增加了配给量后一九五○年已证明能够充分地增加配给量，在今年年底，面包和谷物制品的配给制便已经取消。在增加工资、养老金、疾病津贴、取消翻身农民与归国侨民所负债务，补助新归国的侨民和再次减低商店物价等等方面的措施，已大大地改善了全国各阶层人民的生活水平。自一九五一年元月一日起，还将开始执行五年计划第一年的计划，规定进一步发展包括采煤、钢铁、化学、重机器制造业等在内的主要工业。他说：工业产品和农产品的增加以及国内外贸易的发展，将使我们能在一九五一年进一步走向最后消除经济困难，并改善消费品供应。
    皮克继称：帝国主义阵营散布战争歇斯底里，是想破坏这些争取愉快劳动和将来的成功的计划的，美国帝国主义者正在他自己边疆以外五千英里的地方对正在保卫他们的国家的独立和统一的朝鲜人民作战。美帝国主义在那里遭到严重失败后，正在疯狂地加速使西德重新军事化。根据所谓大西洋公约国布鲁塞尔军事会议，西德将被变成侵略的军事跳板和战场。然而德国人民决心完成爱好和平和民主的德国的统一，缔结公正的对德和约，并要求一切占领军撤退。布拉格八国外长会议已经指明了走向这一伟大目标的道路。
    皮克宣称：格罗提渥总理致联邦总理阿登纳的信，便是共和国政府准备以真诚和相互谅解的精神来谈判成立全德立宪议会和该议会的任务的第一个步骤。采取这一步骤是与我们自德意志民主共和国建立以来所奉行的政策完全符合的。皮克说：美国在西德的疯狂备战，已充分说明我们的政治方针是正确的。我们将在新的一年中继续执行这种政策，并且我相信，东部和西部绝大多数的德国人民都将赞同这一政策。皮克特别指出斯大林大元帅在德意志民主共和国成立的时候曾宣称：“无可怀疑，爱好和平的民主德国与爱好和平的苏联之并肩存在，使得欧洲不再有新战争的可能，结束欧洲的流血，并使世界帝国主义者奴役欧洲成为不可能。”皮克在详细说明一九五○年苏联政府对德国人民的各种援助后指出：这种友谊也表现在苏联倡议召开布拉格八国外长会议一事上。这次会议的决定有助于德国人民完成他们恢复国家统一和独立的任务。
    皮克结语称：明年我们的一切活动、我们的一切努力和政策的最大目标必须是：尽最大努力开展保卫和平的斗争；在全国广泛建立和平委员会，这些委员会必须由我国人民最优秀的代表领导；并且要使全国人民都参加争取和平的斗争。我们的任务是建立一个统一的、爱好和平的民主的德国，这样一个德国将与全世界爱好和平的各国人民保持友好善邻的关系。
