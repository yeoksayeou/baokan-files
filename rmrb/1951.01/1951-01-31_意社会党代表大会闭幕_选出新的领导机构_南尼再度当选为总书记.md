　　Italian Socialist Party Congress Concludes
    Elects New Leadership
    Nenni Reelected as General Secretary
    [News from this newspaper] Xinhua News Agency, Rome, January 23rd (Electric News Agency): At the closing meeting of the 29th National Congress of the Italian Socialist Party, Nenni was reelected as the party's General Secretary. The new leadership body of twenty-one members elected by the Congress is the most united leadership body of the Socialist Party in decades. The members of this body are all key figures in the party who firmly advocate loyal solidarity with the Communist Party.
    The main feature that marked the Bologna meeting—making it significantly different from previous Socialist Party congresses—was the complete absence of factional disputes, with all previous factions turning to support the political report made by Nenni to the Congress. The reactionary newspapers were particularly disappointed by this unity.
    Unlike past sessions, the 29th Congress saw delegates earnestly discuss issues such as party organization, trade union strategies, and the struggle to defend civil liberties, and most importantly, the Italian people's struggle to defend peace.
    In view of the strong demand for unity from the broad masses of party members, the former "centrists" and the weak "reformists" decided to support the current "single left-wing" leadership headed by Nenni. Nenni's leadership won the approval of all the delegates to the Congress, with only two exceptions; there were six hundred delegates in the meeting.
    Senator Morandi, a member of the new leadership body, explained the reason for the current non-sectarian unity within the party, saying: This is because "we have understood that the struggle is the only weapon to strive for unity within the party."
    The Congress finally passed three resolutions on the election of the executive body, party organization, and the struggle for civil liberties and peace. The "Socialist Party and Communist Party Joint Action Covenant" will continue to be the party's basic policy.

### 意社会党代表大会闭幕  选出新的领导机构  南尼再度当选为总书记

　　意社会党代表大会闭幕
    选出新的领导机构         
    南尼再度当选为总书记
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：电通社罗马二十三日电：在意大利社会党第二十九届全国代表大会的闭幕会议上，南尼再度当选为该党总书记。大会所选出的由二十一人组成的该党新的领导机构是社会党数十年来最团结一致的领导机构。这个机构中的成员都是该党坚决主张与共产党忠诚团结的主要人物。
    标志着波伦亚会议的主要特色——使得它和以前历届的社会党代表大会都有着显著的不同——是完全没有派别的争执，以前所有的派别都转而拥护南尼向大会所作的政治报告。反动报纸对于这种团结特别感到失望。
    第二十九届代表大会和过去不同，代表们认真地讨论了党组织的问题、工会策略、为保卫公民自由权利而斗争等问题，而最重要的，就是意大利人民为保卫和平而斗争的问题。
    鉴于广大党员群众对于团结的强烈要求，从前的“中间派”和微弱的“改良派”决定支持目前以南尼为首的“单一左翼”领导。南尼的领导取得了大会全体代表的赞成票，只有两票例外；会议全体代表有六百人。
    新领导机构的一员的上院议员摩兰第在解释目前党内团结没有宗派的原因时说：这是因为“我们已经明白了：斗争是争取党内一致的惟一武器”。
    大会最后通过了关于执行机构的选举、党组织以及为公民的自由权利与和平而斗争等三个决议。“社会党与共产党一致行动公约”今后仍为党的基本方针。
