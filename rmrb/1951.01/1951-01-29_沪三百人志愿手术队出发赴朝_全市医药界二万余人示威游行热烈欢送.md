Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, January 27th: The Shanghai Anti-America Aid-Korea Volunteer Medical Surgical Team, composed of 320 medical workers from Shanghai, departed by train on the morning of the 26th to work on the Korean battlefield. The team includes many nationally renowned physicians and experts, and is equipped with complete and modern medical equipment. On the 25th, over 20,000 medical personnel from across the city held a grand demonstration and parade to send off the surgical team. This team is only a portion of the 1,200 people in Shanghai who have signed up to participate in the Anti-America Aid-Korea volunteer medical teams, and they will serve in various parts of Korea on a rotating basis for six months.

The surgical team includes 128 physicians and 19 labor models; there are medical workers from mission hospitals, as well as private practitioners. Physician Huang Jiasi serves as the team leader. He is a famous thoracic surgery expert and currently the director of thoracic surgery at Shanghai Zhongshan Hospital and Red Cross Hospital. The deputy leaders are Lin Jingcheng, the president of Sino-American Hospital, and Zhang Ximing, the director of the Hospital Management Office of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government Health Bureau. Others include Qian De, an internal medicine expert from Zhongshan Hospital; Lin Chunye, the director of surgery from Zhongshan Hospital; Qiu Fazuo, the director of surgery from Sino-American Hospital; Ji Minsheng, the director of ophthalmology from Sino-American Hospital; Liu Chunsheng, an orthopedic expert from Sino-American Hospital; Li Ruiyong, the deputy director of Shanghai Municipal Fifth Hospital; Li Hao, the director of surgery from Lester Chinese Hospital; and Zhang Disheng, an expert in maxillofacial surgery; and Wang Li, the deputy director of the First Infectious Disease Hospital. This surgical team also took more than 500 boxes of medical equipment and medicines, including X-ray machines, microscopes, a modern "blood bank" and all laboratory equipment. It can perform any war wound surgery and can be responsible for the medical care of 7,500 wounded and sick soldiers at a time. Such a large-scale surgical team is an unprecedented initiative in the history of Chinese medicine. This fully demonstrates the high patriotic enthusiasm of Chinese medical workers.

In recent days, various hospitals, medical schools, and medical organizations in Shanghai have held many large and small send-off meetings. On the 23rd, the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Imperialist Aggression and the Shanghai Medical Workers' Committee for Anti-America Aid-Korea held a city-wide representative send-off meeting of more than 2,000 people, and people from all walks of life presented many banners and flowers. At the meeting, Vice Mayor of Shanghai Pan Hannian delivered a farewell speech on behalf of the six million citizens of Shanghai. On the 25th, over 20,000 people, including private practitioners, traditional Chinese medicine doctors, medical workers from public, private, and mission hospitals, teachers and students from various medical schools, workers from health agencies, and employees of new medicine, traditional Chinese medicine, and medical equipment industries, held a grand demonstration and parade to send the medical team to the front, and went to the station to see the medical team off. The parade was led by a dove team, and many elderly Chinese and Western medicine doctors in their sixties and seventies also participated with banners, chanting slogans for Anti-America Aid-Korea. The sound of firecrackers and cheers never ceased along the way. Some shops even presented flags to the medical team as a tribute. After the parade arrived at the station, a send-off ceremony was held, and Cui Yitian, Minister of the Health Department of the East China Military and Political Committee, also came to the station to say goodbye.
