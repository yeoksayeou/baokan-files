The Indonesian Government Refuses Entry Visas
    Our Women's Federation Delegation Returns to Beijing
    [Reported by this newspaper] Shen Zijiou, Zeng Ke, Qi Yun, and other three members of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, were entrusted by the International Democratic Women's Federation to represent the International Women's Federation and departed from Beijing on November 17th of last year for Indonesia to attend the All-Indonesia Women's Representative Conference held in Jakarta. Although the International Democratic Women's Federation had notified the Indonesian Women's Representative Conference about Shen Zijiou and others entering Indonesia, and Shen and others had personally negotiated with the Indonesian Consul in Hong Kong many times, the Indonesian government deliberately created difficulties and refused to issue entry visas, making it impossible to proceed. Shen and others, deeply regretting this, have reported the details to the International Democratic Women's Federation and returned to Beijing on December 30th of last year.

　　印尼政府拒发入境签证
    我妇联代表团返京
    【本报讯】中华全国民主妇女联合会沈兹九、曾克、戚云等三人，前因受国际民主妇女联合会委托，代表国际妇联于去年十一月十七日离京前往印尼，出席在椰城召开的全印尼妇女代表大会。沈兹九等入印尼国境事，虽早经国际民主妇联通知印尼妇女代表大会，沈等亦亲自在香港与印尼驻港领事多次交涉，但因印尼政府故意留难，拒绝入境签证，以致无法前往。沈等除深表遗憾外，已将详情报告国际民主妇联，并于去年十二月三十日返抵北京。
