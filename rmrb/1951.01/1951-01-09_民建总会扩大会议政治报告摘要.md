Xinhua News Agency, 6th: An abstract of the political report of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce enlarged meeting - "The National Industrial and Commercial Circles Unite to Resist America and Aid Korea, Defend Our Homes and Defend the Country."

　　November 4, 1950, was a great day in Chinese history. On that day, the various democratic parties in China issued a joint declaration, "supporting the people of the whole country to fight for the sacred task of resisting America and aiding Korea, defending our homes and defending the country on a voluntary basis." This shows that the Chinese people who have stood up have been concerned about the safety of their country as masters, and understand the truth that to protect the family, we must first defend the country, and to defend the country, we must help our neighbor.

　　While the U.S. imperialists sent troops to invade Korea, they also sent fleets to invade our territorial waters of Taiwan, established military bases in Taiwan, and openly helped the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to prevent the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan. The invading U.S. air force also invaded our airspace and indiscriminately strafed and bombed.

　　In fact, U.S. imperialism is a more ferocious enemy than the Japanese invaders. A large number of Japanese war criminals with blood on their hands have already been released arbitrarily by MacArthur. In the past, Japanese robbers and Korean gangsters who committed numerous crimes on the Chinese mainland are now slaughtering the Korean people in large numbers under the command of the U.S. and Rhee bandit gangs. For many years, the deadly enemies of the Chinese people, including the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, have become the pawns of U.S. imperialism.

　　The Chinese people love peace, but more than a hundred years of experience have proved that imperialism is the enemy of China's peaceful construction. In order to control the Chinese market and enslave the Chinese people, they are unwilling to see China industrialized, and they are unwilling to see China have national industry and commerce. They will do everything possible to undermine China's peaceful construction, even at the cost of war. For many years, the economic plunder and war destruction imposed on China by imperialism and its running dogs have caused infinite suffering to the Chinese industrial and commercial circles. If we recall the situation of the vast majority of industrialists and businessmen across the country who were displaced during the Anti-Japanese War, and then recall the situation of the vast majority of industrialists and businessmen across the country who were dying under the economic plunder of U.S. imperialism after Japan's surrender, and even recall the damage and difficulties caused by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's blockade of our ports and bombing of our cities with the support of U.S. imperialism after liberation, we will understand that it is futile to carry out construction with a mentality of complacency under the exploitation and plundering of imperialism and its running dogs. The Chinese people must use their own strength to fundamentally eliminate the threat of the enemy and take their destiny into their own hands in order to have peace and peace of mind for construction.

　　The victory of the Chinese people's revolution has laid the foundation for peaceful construction, and we must now consolidate it. Resisting America and aiding Korea is an indispensable action to consolidate the foundation of peaceful construction. In this movement to resist America and aid Korea, the patriotic pact of the industrial and commercial circles initiated in Beijing has been launched in major cities across the country. The main content of the pact is to strengthen the strength of the people's democratic dictatorship. The demonstrations of more than 40,000 industrialists and businessmen in Tianjin and more than 50,000 industrialists and businessmen in Beijing have further advanced the patriotic upsurge of the industrial and commercial circles. These unprecedented achievements can only be produced under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the Central People's Government.

　　The reason why the industrial and commercial circles can have unprecedented enthusiasm today is because they have solved a major ideological problem in the past year or so, especially after adjusting industry and commerce. That is, under the principle of giving consideration to both public and private interests, all industrial and commercial undertakings that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood have become the economic strength of the people and have been protected by the state. China has unlimited resources waiting for everyone to develop, and there is a vast market for everyone to operate in. Once genuine peace is obtained, industrialists and businessmen who have contributed to the people will have endless careers to do.

　　The basic tasks of our industrial and commercial circles in the movement to resist America and aid Korea are to dredge materials, stabilize the market, develop production, consolidate the economy, enthusiastically pay taxes, and ensure supply. The specific methods for implementing this basic task are to more strictly implement the Common Program, more closely accept the leadership of the state-owned economy, further improve the relationship between public and private sectors, labor-capital relations, and trade relations, and give full play to the spirit of collectivism to fight against the deadly enemies of the people. We must pay close attention to the large number of activists who have emerged in the movement to resist America and aid Korea, quickly and well unite with them, and unify everyone's understanding and pace through common learning of current affairs, to unite those who still have ideological concerns and lack enthusiasm. We must understand their concerns with great sympathy and solve problems for them very carefully to increase their enthusiasm and expand our lineup. In this way, we can unite the vast majority of industrialists and businessmen and greatly strengthen the foundation of the people's democratic dictatorship. The few people left are unscrupulous elements who try to be opportunistic and hoard and speculate. For those people, they can still be transformed after persuasion and education, and the full use of organizational power can also make them converge. Only the bandits and special agents who are lurking in the industrial and commercial circles, deliberately creating rumors and even engaging in conspiracy and sabotage activities, are the enemies of the people and must be given relentless blows and complete elimination. Uniting the vast majority of the people to fight against a small number of enemies, victory is completely assured.

### 民建总会扩大会议政治报告摘要

　　民建总会扩大会议政治报告摘要
    【新华社六日讯】民主建国会总会扩大会议政治报告——《全国工商界团结起来为抗美援朝保家卫国而奋斗》的摘要。
    一九五○年十一月四日是中国历史上一个伟大的日子。在那一天，中国各民主党派发表联合宣言，“拥护全国人民在志愿的基础上为着抗美援朝保家卫国的神圣任务而奋斗。”这说明了站立起来的中国人民已经以主人翁的身份关切到自己国家的安全，懂得保家必先卫国，卫国必须救邻的道理。
    美帝国主义在出兵侵略朝鲜的同时，派遣舰队侵入我台湾领海，在台湾建立军事根据地，公开的帮助蒋匪帮阻止中国人民解放台湾。侵朝美空军还侵入我领空滥施扫射与轰炸。
    实际上，美帝国主义是比日寇更凶恶的敌人。大批血手未干的日本战犯，已经被麦魔擅自释放了。过去在中国大陆作恶多端的日本强盗和朝鲜浪人，正在美、李匪帮的指挥之下大量屠杀朝鲜人民。多年以来中国人民的死敌，包括蒋匪帮在内，都已经变成了美帝国主义的爪牙。
    中国人民是爱好和平的，但一百多年来的经验已经证明：帝国主义正是中国和平建设的敌人。它们为着要控制中国市场，奴役中国人民，决不愿意中国工业化，也决不愿意中国有民族工商业，他要千方百计地破坏中国的和平建设，甚至不惜诉诸战争。多年来帝国主义及其走狗们所加于中国的经济掠夺与战争破坏，使得中国工商界遭受到无限的苦难。我们回忆一下在抗日战争当中全国绝大多数工商业者颠沛流离的情景，再回忆一下日本投降以后在美帝国主义经济掠夺之下全国绝大多数工商业者奄奄一息的情景，更回忆一下解放以后在美帝国主义支援之下，蒋匪帮封锁我口岸轰炸我城市所引起的损害与困难，就会明白，在帝国主义及其走狗们的巧取豪夺之下以苟安的心情进行建设是徒劳无功的。中国人民必须用自己的力量根本消除敌人的威胁，把命运掌握在自己的手里，才能有和平，才能安心建设。
    中国人民革命的胜利奠定了和平建设的基础，我们现在必须巩固它，抗美援朝是巩固和平建设基础必不可少的行动，在这次抗美援朝运动中由北京发起的工商界爱国公约，已经展开到全国各大城市，公约的内容主要地就在于加强人民民主专政的力量。天津工商界四万多人和北京工商界五万多人的示威游行，更把工商界爱国的热潮推进了一步。这些空前的成绩是只有在中国共产党和中央人民政府的领导之下才能产生的。
    工商界今天之所以能有前所未有的积极性，就因为他们在过去一年多的时间当中，特别是在调整工商业以后，已经解决了思想上的一个主要问题。那就是，在公私兼顾的原则之下，一切与国计民生有利的工商事业都已经成为人民的经济力量，都得到了国家的保护。中国有无限的资源正待大家开发，有广大的市场可供大家活动。一旦获得了真正的和平，有功于人民的工商业者是会有做不完的事业的。
    我工商界在抗美援朝运动当中，基本任务在于疏通物资，稳定市场，发展生产，巩固经济，踊跃纳税，保障供给。执行这一基本任务的具体办法在于更严格地实行共同纲领，更紧密地接受国营经济的领导，进一步搞好公私关系、劳资关系和同业关系，发挥高度的集体主义的精神，来和人民死敌作斗争。我们必须密切注意在抗美援朝运动当中涌现出来的大批积极分子，很快很好地和他们团结在一起，通过共同学习时事统一大家的认识和步伐，去团结那些在思想上还有顾虑，积极性不够的人们。我们要用高度的同情心去理解他们的顾虑，很细致地为他们解决问题，以提高他们的积极性，扩大自己的阵容。这样，我们就可以团结绝大多数的工商业家，大大地加强了人民民主专政的基础。那遗留下来的少数人，就是希图投机取巧，囤积居奇的不良分子。对于那些人，经过了说服教育还是可以改造的，组织力量的充分运用也可以使他们敛迹。只有潜伏在工商界里面专门造谣生事，甚至进行阴谋破坏活动的匪特，才是人民的敌人，才必须予以无情的打击与彻底的消灭。团结绝大多数的人民来和少数敌人作斗争，胜利是完全有把握的。
