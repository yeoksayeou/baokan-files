　　A Workers' and Shop Assistants' Reading Group

　　The Workers' and Shop Assistants' Reading Group of Beijing's Darentang was organized during the study of current affairs related to the Resist America, Aid Korea campaign. The group consists of sixty-six people, composed of workers and shop assistants from six units: Darentang, Yaguanzhai, Baotaihe, Baijingyu, Xiboji pharmacies, and Yihe Pharmaceutical Factory. They are members of the 13th branch of the 6th division of the Beijing Chinese Medicine Industry Trade Union and also members of the reading group at the 2nd Library Station of the Beijing Second Cultural Center. The head of the reading group is Li Shudong, chairman of the branch.

　　Four people in the group have a middle school education. In addition to studying current affairs and politics, they study algebra for six hours a week at the Normal University Adult Night School. Eight people are semi-literate, focusing on literacy learning. The rest have an elementary school education and participate in adult night school to learn culture. In addition, there are three shoe-shining workers who participate in their group's studies. Members who can read often borrow books from the reading station. Their cultural studies and political activities are centered on Darentang.

　　Since August 13, 1950, the 13th branch led by Li Shudong has held a joint meeting of group leaders and trade union committee members every Tuesday to review work and study the Trade Union Law. In late September, they organized all personnel to study the Common Program, discussing it item by item, while relating it to the situation of the Korean War at that time.

　　Since the launch of the Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect the Home and Defend the Country movement, this reading group has been deeply involved in current affairs study. They study for two hours every Tuesday and Friday evenings from 9 to 11 pm, mainly using the "Current Affairs Handbook," and reading the "People's Daily" and "World Knowledge," organizing discussions.

　　Their learning method is as follows: most comrades mainly listen to lectures, a few with higher education freely read newspapers, and then the cultural center proposes discussion topics or individuals raise questions, which are divided into three groups for discussion. After the discussion, the discussion situation and unresolved issues are reported to the cultural center.

　　After studying current affairs, the ideas of worshipping and fearing the United States among these shop assistants have gradually been eliminated. For example, after everyone read articles exposing the corruption of the United States by returned overseas Chinese, they realized that the actual situation in the United States was not as good as some people said. American workers are also oppressed just like us in the past (during the Chiang Kai-shek rule), only the capitalists are better off. Regarding the atomic bomb issue, everyone said: we were really afraid of the atomic bomb before, but now we understand that the atomic bomb is not scary. During the discussion of the situation in the Korean War, everyone unanimously hoped to see more war reports of our volunteer troops fighting in Korea. Linking the Korean war situation to our representative attending the United Nations to discuss accusing the United States of aggression against Taiwan, everyone unanimously believed that the Soviet Union and we had won a victory. In the study, some ideological problems were also exposed. For example, some even asked, "Will the US imperialists automatically withdraw after the People's Army and our volunteer troops cross the 38th parallel?" "Is it possible for the United States to withdraw from Taiwan?" This shows that they have an unclear understanding of the nature of US imperialist aggression. They will seek a thorough solution to these ideological problems in continuous learning.

### 一个工人店员读报小组

　　一个工人店员读报小组
    北京达仁堂工人、店员读报组，是从抗美援朝时事学习以来组织起来的。全组共有六十六人，由达仁堂、雅观斋、保太和、白敬宇、西博济等药铺和义和制药局六个单位的工人、店员组成。他们是北京市国药业工会第六分会第十三支会的会员，也是北京市第二文化馆第二图书站的读书组组员。读报组的负责人是该支会主任委员李树栋。
    全组有四个人是中学程度，除了学习时事政治外，每星期到师大成人夜校学习六小时代数。八个人是半文盲，以识字学习为主。其余均为高小程度，都参加成人夜校学习文化。此外，还有三个擦皮鞋工人，参加他们组的学习。能看书的组员，经常借阅读书站的图书。他们的文化学习和政治活动，都以达仁堂为中心。
    从一九五零年八月十三日起，李树栋所领导的第十三支会每星期二召开一次小组长、工会委员联席会，除检讨工作外，并学习工会法。九月下旬，又组织全体人员学习共同纲领，逐条讨论，同时联系到当时的朝鲜战争形势。
    自展开抗美援朝保家卫国运动后，这个读报组就深入时事学习。每星期二、五晚上九至十一时学习两小时，以《时事手册》为主，并阅读《人民日报》、《世界知识》，组织讨论。
    他们的学习方法是：多数同志以听讲为主，少数文化程度高的自由阅报，然后由文化馆拟出讨论题目或各人提出问题，分成三个小组讨论。讨论后把讨论情况和没有解决的问题，汇报给文化馆。
    经过时事学习后，在这部分店员中的崇美、恐美思想，已经逐渐消除。例如：大家看了归国华侨揭露美国腐烂的文章后，知道了美国的实际情况，并不如有些人说的那么好。美国的工人也和咱们过去（蒋匪统治时代）一样受压迫，只是资本家好过。对于原子弹问题，大家说：以前实在害怕原子弹，现在明白了，原子弹并不可怕。在讨论朝鲜战争形势时，大家一致希望能多看到我国志愿部队在朝鲜打仗的战报。由朝鲜战局联系到我代表出席联合国讨论控诉美国侵略台湾时，一致认为是苏联和我们打了一个胜仗。在学习中，也暴露了一些思想问题，例如有的竟提出“人民军和我国志愿部队打过三八线以后，美帝是不是会自动撤退呢？”“美国可能从台湾撤退吗？”这说明了他们对美帝侵略的本质认识不清。这些思想问题，他们要在不断的学习中，求得彻底的解决。
