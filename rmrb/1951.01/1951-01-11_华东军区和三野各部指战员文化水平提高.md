　　According to Xinhua News Agency: In the past year, the East China Military Region and the various units of the 3rd Field Army undertook arduous and intense tasks such as combat, bandit suppression, and military training, yet they still universally carried out cultural learning, which improved the cultural level of officers and soldiers. Within a year, the percentage of officers and soldiers who knew less than 200 characters decreased from 45% to 13.4%, while those who knew 1,500 characters increased from 8% to 14% of the total number. Some companies had all their personnel able to recognize more than 500 characters and take simple notes.
    Cultural education in various units was conducted under various circumstances. In relatively stable environments, government offices and troops established more than 120 cultural refresher schools. However, the majority adopted various methods of cultural education based on different situations. The coastal defense forces in Fujian and eastern Zhejiang set up classrooms on the bows of ships and beaches during intense military training, learning skills and culture at the same time. The extremely dispersed and highly mobile bandit suppression units formed study groups in each class to conduct independent self-study and mutual assistance. A certain engineering unit, when building highways, focused on arithmetic in its cultural learning, and everyone learned the four basic operations of integers in a short period of time, with many soldiers learning trigonometry. These facts prove that cultural learning closely serves and combines with the central tasks, rather than being carried out in isolation. This not only did not hinder the execution of work tasks, but on the contrary, improved the cultural level of the troops, which directly helped the troops better complete military, political, and other central tasks.

　　华东军区和三野各部指战员文化水平提高
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：过去一年华东军区和第三野战军各部队担负了作战、剿匪、练兵等繁重而紧张的任务，仍然普遍地进行文化学习，使干部、战士的文化水平得到提高。一年内，各部干部、战士识二百字以下的已由百分之四十五减至百分之十三点四，识一千五百字的已由总人数百分之八增加到百分之十四。有些连队的全部人员能识五百字以上，并会作简单的笔记。
    各部队文化教育是在各种情况下进行的。环境较为安定的机关和部队，建立了一百二十余所文化补习学校。而大多数则是根据不同的情况采取各种方式进行文化教育的。福建和浙东的海防部队，在紧张的练兵中把课堂设在船头上、海滩上，一面学本领，一面学文化。极度分散而且流动性大的剿匪部队，便以各班为单位成立学习小组，独立进行自学互助。某工兵部队在修筑公路时，文化学习以算术为主，大家在短期内都学会了整数四则，许多战士学会了三角测量。这些事实证明：文化学习紧紧地服从和结合中心任务，而不是孤立地去进行，这不但没有妨碍执行工作任务，相反地，提高了部队文化水平，就直接帮助部队更好地完成了军事、政治等中心任务。
