The Experience of the Amateur School of the CCP Central Committee North China Bureau
Meng Jiejun

   I. General Situation

　　The Amateur School of the CCP Central Committee North China Bureau was led by a school affairs committee composed of the general branch, propaganda committee members of each branch, and the principal in September 1948; administratively, it was under the leadership of the personnel section. Until March 1950, due to the busy work of the part-time teachers and the lack of dedicated personnel in charge of the school, although there were achievements, it was intermittent. To better improve the cultural level of worker-peasant cadres, the leadership decided to reorganize in April 1950, appointing a principal and a teacher. All cadres and service personnel who had not reached the level of upper primary school education were required to participate in cultural learning. After a general test, they were divided into eight classes—four classes each for first to fourth grade Chinese language and arithmetic—and mutual aid groups were formed according to work departments. School rules were formulated, and under unified leadership, a "contract" responsibility system was adopted, with the principle of keeping the class sequence unchanged and progressing in level in order. In addition to Party rectification and current affairs studies, classes were taught for a total of seven months.

　　First-grade primary Chinese language students learned 377 characters. Except for five or six people, all were able to read, speak, use, and write. Two-thirds could write simple sentences. Second-grade students learned 500 characters and could all use the characters they recognized to write "colloquial dialogue." One-half could write notes and simple diaries (but with typos). Third-grade students could grasp the central idea in their compositions, the words and sentences were generally smooth, and they could initially use punctuation. Fourth-grade students' compositions progressed from smooth words and sentences to systematically expressing the central idea. The use of words and sentences was more refined than before, typos were basically eliminated, and they could write compositions of 400 to 1,000 characters.

　　First-grade arithmetic students learned addition and subtraction. Second-grade students started from scratch and learned two-digit multiplication and one-digit division. Third-grade students learned multiplication and division from simple to complex, as well as decimal addition, subtraction, and multiplication. Fourth-grade students learned area calculation, and integer four operations were about to be completed.

 II. Teaching Organization and Teaching Work

　　(1) Class Formation and Supplementary Lessons

　　The characteristics of the amateur school for government employees: the students' levels are uneven, their ages vary, and the nature and time of their work vary in terms of busyness, so it is difficult to unify the time for amateur study. Generally, students have a low level of education, but a high level of class consciousness; they have a strong understanding but a weak memory; and learning must be subordinate to work. After a general test, classes were formed according to the following principles: 1. According to their actual level of education. 2. The study time was determined interactively by the majority (four days a week, a total of sixteen hours of class) to resolve the contradiction between work and amateur study time. However, this also had shortcomings: a very small number of people had both Chinese language and arithmetic, so a supplementary lesson method was formulated: either students went to school for supplementary lessons, or teachers went to the group for specific help, with the help of "little teachers" as the main method of supplementary lessons.

　　Seven months of experience have shown that after one test, the students' levels still vary greatly. Some felt it was too fast, some felt it was too slow, some could not keep up due to busy work and asked to drop out, and some asked to move up a class. Based on the above situation, the leadership decided to expand the number of classes in 1951 and organize them according to regular grades.

　　(2) Textbooks, Curriculum Progress, and Teaching Research Association

　　The textbooks used were the three-year, nine-term textbooks compiled by the Beijing Municipal Amateur Education Working Committee, but the arithmetic textbooks were limited to simple four operations, which was not enough, so "Supplementary Problems for Elementary School Fourth and Fifth Grade Arithmetic" were used to make up for the deficiency.

　　Experience has shown that the curriculum should emphasize quality over quantity. Arithmetic should involve more calculation to achieve thorough proficiency. Chinese language should be based on the content: generally one lesson per class. First-grade Chinese language focuses on memorizing new characters and new words, and writing more. Second-grade students, in addition to this, focus on sentence construction and writing to achieve the degree of being able to use what they have learned. Third-grade students focus on training reading ability, sentence construction, and connecting sentences. Fourth-grade students focus on improving writing ability. In the above-mentioned basic period, it is better to be slow than fast. Too fast is not good. For example, although fourth-grade arithmetic completed three terms' worth of tasks in one term, when they wanted to establish a higher grade in the second term, only one out of eight people passed the test.

　　The teaching research association, composed of the principal and teachers, solves new problems that arise in daily teaching. If necessary, comrades with teaching experience among the cadres can be invited to participate and jointly study and solve problems in teaching. This is a very effective method.

 III. Students' Learning and Ideological Situation

　　At the beginning, the students' thinking was as follows: emphasizing "busy work," "too old," "it's okay to do revolutionary work without culture," fear of difficulty and lack of confidence, etc. We held a general meeting of all students, and in response to these incorrect ideas, we explained and persuaded them: using the past status of the working class and masses in the old society, and comparing it with the examples of learning models in various places today, we explained the importance of learning culture. The students' enthusiasm was generally improved. Everywhere you could hear: "Have you finished your homework?" Everywhere you could see students hunched over their desks writing calculations. This high level of learning enthusiasm can be affected by busy work. In addition to doing enlightenment work in the classroom, we should also promptly solve problems in response to the students' ideological situation to ensure the regularity of a high level of learning enthusiasm.

 IV. Several Teaching Experiences

　　(1) The Relationship between Teachers and Students

　　The teacher's political level, ideological level, and mass line teaching methods are very important. The leadership should help teachers improve their political and ideological levels and improve their teaching methods, and should first help them establish the correct view of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers. Teachers should listen to students' opinions at any time and should not have any arrogant or conceited expressions. Prepare lessons thoroughly and write out teaching plans: distinguishing between new characters, new words, writing style, content, structure, and main idea. Without preparation, it is difficult to teach well. Although it takes a lot of effort, it does not produce good results, and the time is not well controlled. When lecturing, the teacher's attitude should be amiable and clear, and the speech should be organized. Especially when teaching lower grades, avoid writing cursive script and write in regular script. Use more vivid examples related to the students themselves to clarify the principles, and never show impatience or criticize students harshly. Be realistic and improve teaching based on the students' level and requirements. In terms of life, style, and political emotions, teachers should integrate with students and should not have any estrangement. Otherwise, the students' learning enthusiasm will be affected, and learning culture will be turned into a burden. Therefore, helping teachers learn and improve their political consciousness is a very important thing.

　　(2) Methods for Correcting Homework and Eliminating Typos in Class

　　Every student's work is very busy. Assigning too much homework will make students feel burdened, so that they simply do not turn in their homework. For homework corrected by teachers, students either do not have time to look at it because of busy work, or they do not understand it. In order to solve the above difficulties for students, problems with more errors or better compositions should be written on the blackboard for everyone to correct, and finally the teacher summarizes everyone's correction opinions, explaining why it should be corrected in this way. This mass-based correction of homework teaching method can enable students to deeply understand writing methods. The correction of third and fourth grade compositions should focus on whether the topic is relevant, and whether there are errors in words, sentences, and punctuation. The first and second grades should focus on correcting typos. This educates the author and also educates everyone. Students' homework should not be corrected without revisions, or revised without correction, and the tendency to over-correct should also be avoided. The principle is that students can accept it, and the original content and words should be retained as much as possible. All typos in each assignment should be recorded, written on the blackboard, and everyone should be mobilized to correct them, and a "Right and Wrong Table" should be established so that the same mistakes are not made next time.

　　(3) Guaranteeing Learning Enthusiasm

　　The amateur school closely cooperates with the Party, the Youth League, and the administration. The administration should provide students with convenient conditions as much as possible. Students should not be given work assignments during class time (except in special circumstances). The Party and the Youth League regard learning as one of the contents of each person's evaluation. Mutual aid groups are formed by departments or several nearby departments to challenge each other to ensure: no late arrivals, no early departures, and writing a leave slip to the relevant administration if something happens and submitting homework regularly. When there are politically related texts, appropriate political content can be explained in conjunction with them. This not only improves culture, but also improves political awareness to consolidate students' learning enthusiasm. Teachers provide specific help to the group, solving all specific problems—explaining problems, finding ways to improve learning methods, and solving how to coordinate learning and work. Scores are announced monthly. Try to change teachers and suspend classes as little as possible. After one term, in coordination with learning evaluations, discuss learning experiences, determine future directions, and finally elect learning models and hold a conference to give material and spiritual rewards.

　　(4) Convening Group Leader Joint Meetings and Student Representative Meetings to Improve Teaching

　　Group leader joint meetings are held monthly to report on the learning situation of the group and introduce typical examples, and to listen to opinions on the school in order to improve work. Student representatives are organized by class to study teaching irregularly. This allows students and teachers to truly integrate and improve students' learning enthusiasm.

　　中共中央华北局机关业余学校经验
    孟杰军
   一、一般情况
    中共中央华北局机关业余学校，在一九四八年九月，由总支、各支部宣传委员、校长等组成校务委员会进行领导；行政上则由人事科领导。至一九五○年三月，因兼课教员工作忙碌，学校又无专人负责，虽有成绩，也是忽紧忽松的。领导上为更好的提高工农干部文化水平，于一九五○年四月决定重新整顿，设校长、教员各一人。凡不及高小毕业程度的干部勤杂人员，一律参加文化学习。经普遍测验，划成八个班——由一年到四年国文、算术各四个班——按工作部门组成互助组，制定校规，在统一领导下，采取“包干”负责制，以班次不动，程度依次上升为原则进行教学。除整党及时事学习外，共授课七个月。
    初小一年级国文，学会三百七十七个字。除五六个人外，都能做到会读、讲、用、写。三分之二能写简单的话。二年级学会五百个字，都能运用识得的字写成“对白话”，二分之一能写便条和简单日记（但有错别字）。三年级作文能抓住中心，词句一般是通顺的，能初步运用标点符号。四年级作文由词句通顺走向有系统的表达中心思想。词句运用较前精炼，错别字基本上消灭了，能写四百到一千字的作文。
    一年级算术学会加减法。二年级从头学起，已学会两位乘法及一位除法。三年级学会由简单到复杂的乘除及小数加减乘法。四年级学会面积，整数四则即将学完。
  二、教学组织与教学工作
        （一）编班、补课
    机关业余学校的特点：学员的程度不齐，年龄不等，工作性质和时间忙闲也不同，因此业余学习时间就难统一。一般学员是文化程度低，而阶级觉悟较高；理解力强而记忆力弱；学习必须服从工作。经普遍测验后，按以下原则进行编班：一、按其实有文化程度。二、依照多数交互制定学习时间（每周四天共十六小时课），以解决工作与业余学习时间的矛盾。但这样做也有缺点：极少数人同时有国文也有算术，于是又制定补课办法：或者学员到校补课，或者教师下组具体帮助，而以小先生帮助补课为主。
    七个月的经验证明，一次测验后进行编班，学员程度仍相差悬殊。有的嫌快，有的嫌慢，有的因工作繁忙跟不上，要求退班，有的要求升班。领导上根据以上情况，决定于一九五一年准备扩大班次，并按正规年级编制。
        （二）教材、课程进度、教学研究会
    教材采用北京市业余教育工作委员会所编的三年九期课本，但算术课本限于简单四则，那是不够的，以“小学四五年级算术补充题”补其不足。
    经验证明，课程宜重质不重量。算术要多演算，以求彻底熟练。国文依内容规定：一般的一堂讲一课。一年级国文重点记生字、生词、多写。二年级除这以外，着重造句写话，以求达到学过就会用的程度。三年级以锻炼阅读能力，造句联句为主。四年级以提高写作能力为重点。在上述的打基础时期，宁慢别快。太快是不好的。如四年级算术虽一期完成了三期任务，但到第二期，想成立较高年级，一测验，八人只有一人及格。
    由校长和教员组成教学研究会，解决日常教学中所发生的新问题。如有必要，可请干部中有教学经验的同志参加，共同钻研解决教学中的问题。这是很有效的办法。
  三、学员学习与思想情况
    开始时，学员的思想情况如下：强调“工作忙”，“年岁太大”，“没有文化也一样搞革命工作”，怕难没信心等等。我们召开了全体学员大会，针对这些不正确想法予以解释说服：以过去工农大众在旧社会的地位，对照今天各地学习模范的实例，说明学习文化的重要。学员情绪普遍提高。到处可以听到：“你的作业做好了吗？”到处可以看到学员伏在桌上写算。这种高度的学习情绪会因工作忙碌而受到影响。除在课堂内经常做启发工作外，还应针对学员思想情况，及时解决问题，保证高度学习热情的经常化。
  四、几点教学经验
        （一）教员与学员的关系
    教员的政治水平、思想水平、以及群众路线的教学方法，都是很重要的。领导上应帮助教员提高政治思想水平，改进教学方法，应首先帮助他们建立为工农兵服务的正确观点。教员要随时倾听学员意见，不能有任何自高自大的表现。要周密的准备功课，写出教学方案：分出生字、生词、课文体裁、内容、结构、大意。没有准备，就讲不好，虽费很大力气，也收不到好效果，时间也掌握不住。讲课时教员态度需和蔼、明朗，说话要有条理。尤其教低年级的课，切忌写草字，要写正楷。要多举与他们本身有关的生动事例，阐明道理，万不可表现急躁，或对学员进行严厉批评。要实事求是，根据学员的程度与要求，改进教学。在生活、作风、政治情感等方面，教员要与学员打成一片，不应有任何隔阂。否则学员的学习情绪就要受影响，反把学习文化当成负担。因此帮助教员学习，提高其政治觉悟，乃是非常重要的事情。
        （二）课堂上批改作业和消灭错别字的办法
    每个学员的工作都是很忙的，留作业过多，反使学员感觉到负担，以致他们索性不交作业。对于教员改过的作业，学员或因工作忙，没有时间看，或者看不懂。为了解决学员的上述困难，应把问题较多或较好的作文写在黑板上，让大家批改，最后由教员总结大家批改的意见，说明为啥这样改。这种群众性的批改作业教学法，能使学员深刻明了写作方法。三、四年级作文的批改，应着重切题不切题，词句和标点符号有没有错误。一、二年级则应着重错别字的改正。这样教育了作者本人，也教育了大家。对学员作业，不能批而不改，或改而不批，还要避免批改过多的偏向，要尽量保留原有内容和词句，以学员能接受为原则。应该将每次作业中所有的错别字记下来，写在黑板上，发动大家改，并建立“正误表”，使这次错的下次不错。
        （三）保证学习情绪
    业余学校与党、团、行政等密切配合，行政上尽量给学员以便利条件，上课时间不给学员工作任务（特殊情况不在内）。党、团把学习作为每人鉴定内容之一。由部门或较近的几个部门组成互助组，互相挑战保证：不迟到、不早退、有事到所属行政上写请假条、经常交作业。遇有与政治有关的课文，可联系适当政治内容讲解。这样不但提高了文化，并可提高政治认识，以巩固学员学习情绪。教员到小组具体帮助，解决一切具体问题——讲解问题，想办法改善学习方法，解决学习与工作如何配合问题。每月公布成绩。尽量少换教员少停课。一期完了之后，配合学习鉴定，漫谈学习心得，定出今后努力方向，最后普选学习模范，召开大会给以物质及精神的奖励。
        （四）召开组长联席会与学代会以改进教学
    每月召开小组长联席会，汇报小组学习情况及典型介绍，并听取对学校的意见，借以改进工作。以班为单位组织学习代表，不定期研究教学。这样使学员和教员真正打成一片，提高学员的学习积极性。
