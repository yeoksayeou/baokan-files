Xinhua News Agency, January 2nd: TASS reports: The movement of West German people opposing remilitarization in obedience to American orders continues to grow. The thousands of resolutions passed by working people in West German enterprises and organizations, the statements issued by representatives of political and cultural circles, and the opinion polls and distributed questionnaires conducted among the people in various parts of West Germany all prove this point. For example, a special edition of a Hanover newspaper solicited readers' opinions on West German remilitarization. Among 33,000 readers, 85.1 percent resolutely opposed remilitarization. In the Stuttgart and Ludwigsburg areas, almost all police officers refused to train so-called "mobile police," which, like "industrial police," "labor battalions," etc., are merely disguised military forces.

　　西德人民反对重新军事化
    【新华社二日讯】塔斯社讯：西德人民反对遵从美国命令进行重新军事化的运动继续增涨。西德各企业和各团体劳动人民所通过的成千决议、政治与文化界代表们所发表的声明以及在西德各地人民中间进行的投票和散发的意见调查表，都证明了这点。例如汉诺威一家报纸的号外曾向读者征询关于西德重新军事化的意见。在三万三千个读者中，有百分之八十五点一坚决反对重新军事化。在斯图加特和路德威格斯堡地区差不多所有的警察都拒绝训练所谓“机动警察”，这种警察，正如“工业警察”、“劳动大队”等等一样，不过是伪装的军事部队而已。
