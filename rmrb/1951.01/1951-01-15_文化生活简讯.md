　　Cultural Life News in Brief
　　Shanghai Huizhong Eradicates American Imperialist Influence, Renamed Five Loves
　　Shanghai's "Huizhong" primary and secondary school recently changed its name. It was founded sixty years ago by the American Southern Baptist Convention. At that time, American imperialism unreservedly exposed its aggressive ambitions.

The purpose of American imperialism in establishing this school is self-evident. Today, the teachers and students of the school have awakened and proposed "changing the school song, changing the school name." From January 1, 1951, "Huizhong" primary and secondary school was renamed Five Loves Primary and Secondary School, the five loves being love of the motherland, love of the people, love of labor, love of science, and cherishing public property.
