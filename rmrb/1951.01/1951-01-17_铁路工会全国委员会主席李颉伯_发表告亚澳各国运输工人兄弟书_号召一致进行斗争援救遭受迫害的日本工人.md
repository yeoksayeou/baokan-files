Xinhua News Agency, 16th: Li Jiebo, Chairman of the National Committee of the Railway Union of China, issued a "Letter to Transportation Worker Brothers in Asia and Australia" on the 15th, calling on them to unite and support the Japanese worker brothers who are being persecuted by the US-Japanese reactionaries in the so-called "Matsukawa Incident." The full text is as follows:

Brothers of transportation workers in Asia and Australia:

With extraordinary indignation, we have heard of the series of crazy persecutions of Japanese railway worker brothers by the US-Japanese reactionaries in the past six months. Recently, under the instruction of US imperialism, the reactionary Japanese government fabricated the so-called "Matsukawa Train Derailment Incident," shamelessly slandering the Japanese Communist Party and the Railway Union, arresting twenty patriotic railway workers, including Suzuki Nobu, chairman of the Fukushima Branch of the Japanese National Railway Union, and arbitrarily sentencing them to death, life imprisonment, and fixed-term imprisonment on December 6, 1950. This is a new fascist atrocity by the US-Japanese reactionaries.

This so-called "Matsukawa Incident," like the past "Shimoyama Incident," "Mitaka Incident," and the conspiracy to suppress the workers' struggle against the massive layoffs by the "National Railway" in July 1949, is not accidental. It is just like the Nazi Reichstag fire in 1933. They are all planned actions by the US-Japanese reactionaries to suppress and persecute the Japanese working class and destroy the peaceful and democratic movement of the Japanese people, all in order to smoothly arm Japanese fascists, support the resurgence of Japanese aggressive forces, turn Japan into a colony of US imperialism, and use it as a military base for aggression against Asia and domination of the world. This is a challenge by the US-Japanese reactionaries to the Japanese working class, and also a challenge to the Asian-Australian working class and the working class of the whole world.

Comrades: Experience has proved that the interests of the working class can only be obtained by relying on their own efforts. We all understand that the interests of the world's working class are consistent and indivisible, and the fate of the Japanese working class is even more closely related to us, the Asian and Australian working class. If we ignore the persecution suffered by our Japanese railway worker brothers, it is tantamount to encouraging the arrogance of the US-Japanese reactionaries. Therefore, we must not sit idly by and watch these endless atrocities of the US-Japanese reactionaries. We must regard the persecution suffered by our Japanese worker brothers as if it were our own, and unite to support them. We believe that as long as the working class of the entire Asia-Australia and even the world unite closely and carry out an irreconcilable struggle against the US-Japanese reactionaries to stop the atrocities of the US-Japanese fascists, they can be released at an early date.

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Chairman of the National Committee of the Railway Union of China, Li Jiebo

　　铁路工会全国委员会主席李颉伯
    发表告亚澳各国运输工人兄弟书
    号召一致进行斗争援救遭受迫害的日本工人
    【新华社十六日讯】中国铁路工会全国委员会主席李颉伯在十五日发表《告亚澳各国运输工人兄弟书》，号召他们一致起来支援在所谓“松川事件”中被美日反动派迫害的日本工人兄弟。全文如下：亚澳各国运输工人兄弟们：
    我们以异常愤慨的心情，听到近半年来美日反动派对日本铁路工人兄弟的一连串疯狂迫害。最近日本反动政府在美帝国主义授意之下，又制造所谓“松川列车颠覆事件”，对日本共产党和铁路工会加以无耻的诬害，逮捕了日本国营铁路工会福岛分会委员长铃木信等二十名爱国铁路工人，并于一九五○年十二月六日横蛮无理地将他们判处死刑、无期徒刑和有期徒刑。这是美日反动派新的法西斯暴行。
    这一次的所谓“松川事件”与过去的“下山事件”、“三鹰事件”及镇压为反对一九四九年七月“国铁”大量裁员而展开的工人斗争的阴谋事件都不是偶然的，都与一九三三年纳粹国会纵火事件如出一辙，都是美日反动派镇压、迫害日本工人阶级，摧残日本人民和平民主运动的有计划行动，都是为了使他们能顺利的武装日本法西斯，扶植日本侵略势力再起，把日本变为美帝国主义的殖民地，作为侵略亚洲统治全世界的军事基地。这是美日反动派向日本工人阶级的挑战，也是对亚澳工人阶级和全世界工人阶级的挑战。
    同志们：经验证明工人阶级的利益，只有依靠自己去争取才能得到。我们都了解：世界工人阶级的利益是一致的，不可分割的，而日本工人阶级的命运更与我们亚澳工人阶级休戚相关。如果我们漠视日本铁路工人兄弟所遭受的迫害，就无异于助长了美日反动派的气焰。因此，我们决不能坐视美日反动派这种层出不穷的暴行，我们必须把日本工人弟兄所遭受的迫害视同身受，一致起来声援他们，支持他们。我们相信：只要我们全亚澳以至全世界的工人阶级紧密地团结起来，与美日反动派进行不调和的斗争，制止美日法西斯蒂的暴行，他们就可以早日获得释放。
