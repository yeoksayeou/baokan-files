　　Jinan Railway Factory's Zhang Huaiyu, Zhang Naiyu, and Zhang Zhenru
    Set New National Record in Manufacturing Type B Brake Shoes
    Increasing Production from 15 Boxes to 160 Boxes per Day

    [Reported by this newspaper] In the production competition, Zhang Huaiyu, Zhang Naiyu, and Zhang Zhenru, young workers at the Jinan Railway Factory's Foundry Workshop, displayed a high degree of patriotic enthusiasm, leveraging their initiative and ingenuity to increase brake shoe production from 15 boxes per person per day to 160 boxes, setting an unprecedented national record. Zhang Huaiyu, a young worker at the Jinan Railway Factory's Foundry Workshop, joined the movement to create new records along with all the workers in the factory last year in order to welcome the first National Day. At the beginning of the movement, he set four new records in rapid succession within half a month, gradually increasing the production of Type B brake shoes from 15 boxes per day (eight hours) to 50 boxes. By early December of last year, under the leadership of the trade union, the factory workers continued to carry out a vigorous patriotic production competition. In the patriotic competition, Zhang Huaiyu, after learning about the current situation and the atrocities of American imperialism's mad aggression in Korea, recalled the oppression he suffered under the Japanese puppets and Chiang Kai-shek bandits in the past, which further aroused his deep hatred for American imperialism and his enthusiasm for resisting America and aiding Korea. He resolved to resist America and aid Korea with practical actions by stepping up production. In mid-December, he created a record of 96 boxes in eight hours. At the same time, with his solidarity, help, and encouragement, Zhang Naiyu, a young worker in the same group, also achieved the same record. Both of them received commendations from the Railway Bureau and a bonus of 100 work points each. The Jinan Railway Factory Committee of the Communist Youth League also issued a circular praising them. At this time, the news came from the Jiulonggang Railway Factory that worker Wang Changhua had achieved a record of 122 boxes of Type B brake shoes per day. This gave Zhang Huaiyu and Zhang Naiyu new encouragement. Under the suggestion of worker Yang Zhihai, they began to study and improve their tools. After several days of research, with the help of the foreman and workers, they made a light iron model, which increased production to 103 boxes. After that, encouraged by the trade union and the workers, they continued to research and, after several days of painstaking study, with the help of model supervisor Wang Wenzhao, drew up a design on December 26. Model foreman Liu Wanchun, wood pattern workers Liu Chuanguang, Han Qingxiang, Wu Kekuan, and others then made a wooden pattern in their spare time. On December 30, they officially tested it in their spare time. The two divided the work: Zhang Huaiyu did the lower part, and Zhang Naiyu did the upper part. One after the other, like making adobe, one box after another. The test results showed that it took only two to three minutes to make one box, and it was estimated that 240 boxes could be made in eight hours. The quality of the casting was also better than before, cleaner and without burrs. However, doing it non-stop for eight hours every day would be detrimental to health, so currently they each make 160 boxes per day (eight hours), setting an unprecedented national record (Shijiazhuang and Hengyang Railway Factories use machines to produce less than 100 boxes). After the technique is mastered, they can increase it to 240 boxes per day. On the 5th of this month, group leader Zhang Zhenru also created a record of 160 boxes after them. Currently, they are drawing up designs of the wooden pattern they created and preparing to send them to Wang Changhua and brother factories such as Shijiazhuang to exchange experiences, jointly improve production, and increase the power to build the motherland.

　　济南铁路工厂张怀玉张乃玉张振儒
    造乙型闸瓦创全国新纪录
    由过去日造十五箱提高到一百六十箱
    【本报讯】济南铁路工厂铸工场青年工人张怀玉、张乃玉、张振儒，在生产竞赛中，以高度的爱国热情，发挥自己的积极性与智慧，造闸瓦由每人每日生产十五箱提高到一百六十箱，创造了全国空前的纪录，张怀玉是济南铁路工厂铸工场青年工人，去年为了迎接第一个国庆日，张怀玉与全厂工人一同投入了创造新纪录运动。在运动开始，半月间即连创四次新纪录，做乙型闸瓦由过去日造（八小时）十五箱逐步提高到五十箱。至去年十二月初该厂工人在工会领导下，又继续开展了热火朝天的爱国主义生产竞赛。在爱国竞赛中，张怀玉由于学习了目前形势知道了美帝国主义在朝鲜进行疯狂侵略的暴行，于是使他回忆起了过去遭受日伪蒋匪的压迫，更激起了他对美帝的高度憎恨和抗美援朝的热情，决心以加紧提高生产的实际行动，抗美援朝。十二月中旬，他便创造了八小时做九十六箱的纪录。同时，在他的团结帮助与鼓舞下，同组青年工人张乃玉亦达到同样纪录。两人均获得路局嘉奖，并各得奖金一百工资分。青年团济南铁路工委会也曾通令表扬。此时，九龙岗铁路工厂传来了工人汪长华每日生产乙型闸瓦一百二十二箱的最高纪录。这对张怀玉、张乃玉起了新的鼓舞作用。他们在工人杨志海的提议下，开始研究改进工具，经数日研究，在工长与工人的帮助下，做出了轻铁的模型，产量提高到一百零三箱。此后，又在工会与工人们的鼓励下，继续研究，经数天苦心钻研，在模型监工王文照的帮助下，于十二月二十六日画出图样，又经模型领班刘万春、木型工人刘传光、韩庆祥、吴克宽等在业余时间制成木型。十二月三十日他们在业余时间正式试验，两人分工合作：张怀玉做下部，张乃玉做上部，一前一后，像打坯一样、一箱接着一箱，试验结果，每做一箱仅二分钟到三分钟，计每八小时能做二百四十箱，铸出的质量也比从前为好，又干净又无毛刺，但每日八小时不停地做，对身体健康有损，故目前他们每人每日（八小时）各做一百六十箱，创造了全国空前纪录（石家庄、衡阳铁路工厂用机器做，出产不到一百箱），待手法熟练后，能提高到日做二百四十箱。本月五日，组长张振儒，亦在他们之后，创造了一百六十箱的纪录。目前，他们正在把自己创造的木型画出图样，准备寄给汪长华及石家庄等兄弟工厂，以交流经验，共同提高生产，增加建设祖国的力量。
