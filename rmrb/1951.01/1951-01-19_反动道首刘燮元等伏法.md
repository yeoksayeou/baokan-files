　　Reactionary Dao Leaders Liu Xieyuan and Others Executed
    Based on the demands of the broad masses of the people, the Military Law Department of the Beijing Military Control Commission of the People's Liberation Army executed the extremely wicked special agent and reactionary Yiguandao leaders Liu Xieyuan, Liu Xiangting, Zhang Honghai, Hu Chunlin, Mu Zhaozeng, and Li Maowu (Jiugongdao leader) on the 17th of this month. This is of great significance for consolidating revolutionary order and protecting the lives and property of the people of Beijing.
    The five criminals, Liu Xieyuan and others, were all Japanese special agents and Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang special agents who appeared as reactionary Yiguandao leaders, and their crimes were obvious. Liu Xieyuan once served as the head of the Japanese puppet joint guarantee, killing four of our anti-Japanese guerrillas. After Japan surrendered, they transformed themselves into special agents of the Kuomintang's military intelligence (Jun Tong) and Central Statistics Bureau (Zhong Tong), engaging in counter-revolutionary activities in the form of Yiguandao and others. Many good people and patriotic people were brutally murdered by these special agents; countless people were plundered by them until they were destitute, without clothes or food; and many young women were raped by these criminals. Jiugongdao leader Li Maowu was also a traitor and Kuomintang special agent. During the period of Japanese寇rule, he participated in the so-called "Peace General Church" organized by Li Shutian and hired Japanese 二宫博夫 as an advisor. In 1947, he colluded with Jun Tong special agent Liu Peizhong (a Daoist) to carry out counter-revolutionary activities and participated in the so-called "Production Promotion Association" in the Kuomintang special agent organization, with Li acting as a guidance committee member. He repeatedly organized reactionary armed forces in Shandong, Beijing, and other places to resist our army. The criminal called himself "Great Emperor" and "True Dragon Son of Heaven" to deceive the people. After the liberation of Beijing, these culprits, stained with the blood of the people, not only did not wake up but continued to be enemies of the people, disregarding the government's order to ban reactionary secret societies, slandering the people's government, and cooperating with the US imperialist aggressive war to massacre the Korean people, creating rumors of a third world war among the masses, sabotaging the country's and people's production and construction, and attempting to wait for an opportunity to carry out armed rebellion, attempting to subvert the people's power.
    The Beijing Military Control Commission's sentencing of the above six criminals to death completely meets the demands of the broad masses of the people. Since the arrest of the six criminals, people from all walks of life in Beijing and ordinary Daoists have filed lawsuits with the government, accusing them of their crimes and repeatedly requesting the People's Government to avenge the masses. Other reactionary Dao leaders who have not yet repented should understand that the People's Government is responsible to the people. Since the people demand the thorough elimination of Yiguandao and other reactionary secret societies, the People's Government must be responsible for meeting the people's legitimate demands. Therefore, they should wake up, abandon the path of self-destruction of Liu Xieyuan and others, quickly register with the government, hand over the organization, stop all illegal activities, to obtain the understanding of the people and be a new person.

　　反动道首刘燮元等伏法
    人民解放军北京市军事管制委员会军法处，根据广大人民的要求，于本月十七日已将罪大恶极的特务、反动的一贯道首刘燮元、刘翔亭、张鸿海、胡春霖、穆肇增、李懋五（九宫道首）等六犯判处极刑。这对巩固革命秩序，保护北京市人民生命财产的安全，具有非常重要的意义。
    刘燮元等五犯，都是以反动的一贯道道首出现的罪恶昭彰的日本特务和蒋介石匪帮的特务。刘燮元曾充任日伪联保主任，杀害我抗日游击队员四名。日本投降后，他们又摇身一变，成为国民党军统、中统的特务，以一贯道等形式进行反革命活动。很多善良的人民及爱国志士，惨遭这些特务分子的屠杀；无数人民被他们掠夺得倾家荡产，无衣无食；很多青年妇女遭到这些罪犯的奸污。九宫道道首李懋五，也是汉奸、国民党特务分子。在日寇统治时期，他曾参加李匪书田组织的所谓“和平总教会”，并聘日本人二宫博夫为顾问，一九四七年和军统特务刘培中（道徒）勾结一起进行反革命活动，并参加国民党特务组织中的所谓“生产促进会”，李逆任辅导委员。先后曾在山东、北京等地数次组织反动武装，对抗我军。该犯自称为“大皇帝”“真龙天子”以欺骗人民。北京解放后，这些满身沾染人民血迹的罪魁，不但没有醒悟，而且继续与人民为敌，无视人民政府取缔反动会道门的命令，诽谤人民政府，并配合美帝屠杀朝鲜人民的侵略战争，在群众中制造第三次世界大战的谣言，破坏国家、人民的生产建设，并妄图等待时机，进行武装叛乱，妄图颠覆人民政权。
    北京市军管会判处上述六犯以极刑，完全合乎广大人民的要求。从六犯被逮捕以后，北京各界人民及一般道徒，即纷纷向政府控诉他们的罪恶，一再请求人民政府为群众复仇。其他至今仍不悔悟的反动道首，应该懂得，人民政府是对人民负责的，人民既然要求彻底肃清一贯道及其他反动会道门，那么，人民政府就一定要负责满足人民的正当要求。因此，他们应该猛醒过来，舍弃刘燮元等自取毁灭的道路，迅速向政府登记，交出组织，停止一切非法活动，以取得人民的谅解，重新作人。
