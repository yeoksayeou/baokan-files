[Our Newspaper] The Renmin University of China is preparing to welcome its first winter vacation. Under the leadership of the school Party committee, the winter vacation work committee has been jointly organized by the Communist Youth League, the Trade Union, and the Student Union. The holiday activities will adopt various methods to deeply carry out the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, and further implement and strengthen patriotic ideological education. Current affairs learning will be the focus of the activities, and four or five reports will be systematically organized, and discussions will be held in connection with reality, so that students can clearly understand the current situation and tasks, eliminate the remnants of erroneous thinking left over from the long-term aggression of imperialism, especially American imperialism, and strengthen the emotions of hating, despising, and looking down upon American imperialism. At the same time, deepen the students' love for the people's motherland, and improve their national self-esteem and self-confidence. In addition, cultural and sports activities such as movies, skating, ball games, and singing will be carried out during the holidays, on the one hand, to exercise and improve health; on the other hand, combined with patriotic education, to cultivate students' strong and brave revolutionary qualities. According to the instructions of the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of Education on carrying out mass propaganda work during the Spring Festival, the winter vacation work committee plans to organize large-scale celebrations and activities to comfort the families of martyrs and military personnel, so that students can gain profound education from mass work.
