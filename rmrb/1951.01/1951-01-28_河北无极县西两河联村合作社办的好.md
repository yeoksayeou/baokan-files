　　The Xilianghe United Village Cooperative in Wuqi County, Hebei Province, is Doing Well
    In the Xilianghe United Village Cooperative in Wuqi County, many cooperative members come to buy goods, and the cadres are overwhelmed. Members have to wait a long time to buy anything. Therefore, the cadres, through the members' representative meeting, bought a small cart. Every one, six, or two, seven day of the month, they push the cart with foreign cloth, salt, alkali noodles, and kerosene to each village to supply the members. These villages plant a lot of cotton, and the harvest is good. The members want to sell the cotton. Therefore, the cooperative cadres signed a contract with the county cooperative to exchange the members' cotton for various goods at reasonable prices (this is the main way to solve the problem of farmers selling their products, and grassroots cooperatives in various places should learn from it – Editor). This makes the members feel very convenient, and at the same time, the cooperative business has expanded. In two months, the purchase and sale of goods amounted to 50.87 million yuan. The accounts are cleared every day, very clearly, and a summary is made every month, without any errors.
    When the members see that their cooperative is doing well, they all say, "It's much better than the previous cooperative." Lu Dachun, a member of the Xilianghe Cooperative, said, "The people in the cooperative push the cart to other villages every other day, and they don't eat our food. They don't come back until dark. They are really working hard!" Because of the good performance of the cooperative, the members increased the cadres' monthly allowance from 100 jin of rice to 120 jin at the second members' representative meeting.

　　河北无极县西两河联村合作社办的好
    无极县西两河联村合作社，买货的社员很拥挤，干部们忙不过来，社员买点货得等许多时间。干部们乃通过社员代表会，买了辆小车，每逢一、六，或二、七日，推着洋布、食盐、碱面和煤油到各村去供给社员。这几个村种棉花很多，而且又丰收了，社员们要想把棉花卖出去，于是该社干部便和县社订立了合同，用各种货物，合理的换购社员棉花（这是解决广大农民销售自己产品的主要办法，各地基层社都应学习——编者），这样使社员感到很方便，同时社务也扩大了。两个月购销货物达五千○八十七万元。账目一天一清，弄的很清楚，每月一总结，没有发生过差错。
    社员们见到自己的合作社办的好，大家一致说：“比早先的社可强的多了。”西两河社员卢大春说：“社里人们三天两头推着车子到外村去，又不吃我们的饭，黑了才回来，真够辛苦了！”社员们因合作社办的成绩好，在第二次社员代表大会上将干部每月津贴米由一百斤提高到一百二十斤。
